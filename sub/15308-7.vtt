- That was freakin' amazing!

What do you think, babe? Are
we ready for the Big Apple?

00:51.512 --> 00:53.222
I still can't believe

00:53.305 --> 00:55.099
that your mom agreed to take you guys.

00:55.182 --> 00:56.934
Well, it's not every day
that a big-time music producer

00:57.017 --> 00:58.686
messages you for a meeting.

00:58.769 --> 01:00.938
Okay, less canoodling. More packing.

01:01.021 --> 01:02.607
Mom, Grace isn't even here yet.

01:02.690 --> 01:05.316
Oh, uh... didn't you get
her text? She's not coming.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.652

01:06.736 --> 01:07.862
Wait, so it's just gonna be

01:07.945 --> 01:08.946
- you and Jonah...
- [sighs heavily]

01:09.029 --> 01:10.948
...alone in a hotel room?

01:11.031 --> 01:12.742
Yeah, yeah. We'll... We'll
make it work. Don't worry.

01:12.825 --> 01:15.160
We can, uh... We can use our
backing track for percussion.

01:15.244 --> 01:16.245
Okay.

01:16.328 --> 01:19.624
Well, now that there's
extra room, maybe I can come?

01:19.707 --> 01:21.250
Zig, I wish. But there's
no way my mom would be cool

01:21.333 --> 01:22.376
with us sharing a hotel room.

01:22.459 --> 01:23.711
But she doesn't care about Jonah?

01:23.794 --> 01:25.129
Because we're just friends.

01:26.506 --> 01:27.840
[softly] I just don't trust him.

02:44.249 --> 02:46.376

03:04.678 --> 03:06.222

03:30.838 --> 03:32.339
Shush! Someone might hear.

03:32.422 --> 03:34.424
Okay, well, if I had an
epic kiss with my crush,

03:34.508 --> 03:35.550
I'd shout it from the rooftops.

03:35.635 --> 03:36.677
I don't know what it means,

03:36.761 --> 03:38.929
and I won't until she's back from New York.

- Oh!

Don't you have some cute boy to flirt with?

- Duh! Yeah, I do.

03:51.525 --> 03:52.735
You're...

03:53.653 --> 03:54.820
you're not in New York.

03:54.904 --> 03:56.697
My mom freaked out about me going,

03:56.781 --> 03:58.198
'cause I coughed up blood, like, last week.

03:58.282 --> 04:00.785
- I'm sorry.
- This disease isn't your fault.

04:00.868 --> 04:02.327
Not for that. For kissing you.

04:03.412 --> 04:04.664
[chuckles nervously] What?

04:04.747 --> 04:06.165
Don't be sorry.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.711
Am I hotter than Jonah? Be honest.

04:11.837 --> 04:13.255
Actually, don't.

Should I call the producer
"Holland" or "Mr. Jacks"?

04:59.927 --> 05:01.178
I think you should just
wow him with your music,

05:01.261 --> 05:02.763

- you're smart, you're talented.
- [chuckles]

so terrible to look at.

[both chuckling]

05:49.018 --> 05:50.185
But...

05:50.853 --> 05:52.396
I mean, he's...

05:52.479 --> 05:54.481
Well, he's distracting you from
what's really important, right?

05:54.564 --> 05:57.067
What, am I just supposed
to ignore his feelings?

05:57.151 --> 06:00.445
Well, not forever... But
maybe until after our meeting?

06:07.035 --> 06:08.804
_

06:08.829 --> 06:10.622
Am I the worst person in the world?

06:10.705 --> 06:11.916
Pretty much.

06:11.999 --> 06:14.459
- No, I'm just kidding.
- What was that question again?

06:14.543 --> 06:15.920
Do I have what it takes to succeed?

06:16.879 --> 06:18.422
I think you just answered that.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.008
[chuckles]

06:23.135 --> 06:25.262
"To be or not to be."

06:25.345 --> 06:28.057
What is Hamlet considering
in this famous speech?

06:29.516 --> 06:30.684
Miles?

06:32.602 --> 06:34.188
- Miles Hollingsworth?
- [students giggle]

06:35.564 --> 06:36.648
Uh, hmm?

06:36.731 --> 06:39.151
Uh, Hamlet is depressed.

06:39.234 --> 06:42.571
And he's trying to figure out
if hurting himself is a way out.

06:43.738 --> 06:45.074
But it's not.

06:45.157 --> 06:47.117
[bell ringing]

06:49.661 --> 06:51.788
I took notes, but it'll cost you.

06:53.540 --> 06:56.085
Ew! Did you sleep in a dumpster... [coughs]

06:56.168 --> 06:57.920
or two dumpsters?

06:59.546 --> 07:02.049
- What happened last night?
- You don't remember?

07:03.175 --> 07:05.177
It was epic.

07:05.260 --> 07:07.596
First, we snuck into this amazing club.

07:07.679 --> 07:10.724
They wouldn't serve us, so you
swiped a bottle from the bar.

07:10.808 --> 07:12.434
Then this bouncer tried to stop you.

07:13.393 --> 07:15.104
And then what?

07:15.187 --> 07:17.397
By the time I got out, you were MIA.

07:19.733 --> 07:22.402
- I could've... I could've died.
- But you didn't.

07:22.486 --> 07:24.529
Would you rather have spent
the night with Mommy...

07:25.655 --> 07:27.282
- and Daddy?
- Obviously not.

07:29.576 --> 07:30.785
This'll take the edge off.

07:33.705 --> 07:34.832
What's in here?

07:35.582 --> 07:36.876
Does it matter?

07:39.044 --> 07:40.295
[Miles sighing]

07:50.222 --> 07:51.431
[both sigh]

07:52.349 --> 07:55.269
Hi. Um, I have a meeting with Mr. Jacks.

07:55.352 --> 07:57.146
Holland's in a session with
Pink. Is he expecting you?

07:57.229 --> 07:59.398
Well, he messaged me and said,

07:59.481 --> 08:02.026
"Love your song. If you're
ever in town, we should meet,"

08:02.109 --> 08:04.862
and I said, "I'll be here next Thursday."

08:04.945 --> 08:06.571
You know that's not how
you make a meeting, right?

08:08.875 --> 08:10.960
- Name?
- Maya Matlin.

08:12.036 --> 08:13.745
The girl who wrote "Not Okay."

08:14.746 --> 08:16.081
Sit down.

08:19.334 --> 08:21.211
[sighs] Okay, just deep
breaths. It'll be fine.

08:21.295 --> 08:23.463
[receptionist] There's a Maya
Matlin here. Did you wanna see her?

08:25.007 --> 08:26.508
[door opening]

08:26.591 --> 08:28.343
- Maya?
- Uh, Mr. Jacks.

08:28.427 --> 08:29.844
[stuttering] I mean...

08:29.929 --> 08:31.096
- No, Holland's fine.
- Yeah.

08:31.180 --> 08:32.556
I'm stuck in studio all day,

08:32.639 --> 08:34.599
but if you're still here
tomorrow, I can squeeze you in.

08:34.683 --> 08:37.227
Thank you. Um, I'm so excited
to play "Not Okay" for you.

08:37.311 --> 08:39.604
Oh, I've already heard that
one. You got something new?

08:39.688 --> 08:42.524
Uh, is there a specific
sound you're looking for or...

08:42.607 --> 08:43.984
Just do you.

08:47.905 --> 08:49.198
[sighs heavily]

08:51.700 --> 08:55.412
[Grace] I heard there's this
amazing doc about a California cult.

08:55.495 --> 08:57.957
Oh, sounds super romantic.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.084
Is that what you want?

09:00.167 --> 09:01.501
A romance?

09:03.253 --> 09:04.629
Don't you?

09:05.797 --> 09:07.382
[door slides open]

09:08.092 --> 09:09.509
Girls suck.

09:11.095 --> 09:14.098
[sighs] I think you're in the wrong place.

09:14.181 --> 09:16.516
I've texted Maya, like, 20 times.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.144
No response. Not even read receipts.

09:19.228 --> 09:20.895
[sighing] I'm starting to get worried.

09:20.980 --> 09:23.273
About her safety, or whether
she's getting busy with Jonah?

09:23.357 --> 09:24.858
I know that she's sharing a room,

09:24.942 --> 09:26.276
but do you think she's sharing a bed?

09:26.360 --> 09:27.361
Who cares? They're just friends.

09:27.444 --> 09:29.488
Yeah, but he's a guy, and she's a girl.

09:29.571 --> 09:31.906
So if it was two girls,
it would be different?

09:32.824 --> 09:33.993
Well, yeah.

09:34.909 --> 09:37.829
I mean, you and Grace aren't
gonna suddenly start making out.

09:38.622 --> 09:40.124
[Zig sighs]

09:40.207 --> 09:41.666
You're right. [sighs]

09:41.750 --> 09:44.836
Maya and Jonah are probably
mashing faces right now.

09:44.919 --> 09:46.964
Mom in the same room. Kinky.

09:47.047 --> 09:48.798
Look, you guys are supposed
to make me feel better.

09:48.882 --> 09:51.551
Then maybe you should go
find a more sympathetic ear.

09:51.635 --> 09:54.346
Yeah, well, Tiny's on a
date and you're all I've got.

09:55.805 --> 09:57.307
What are we watching?

09:58.475 --> 10:00.685
[slurring] Are you hungry? I'm hungry.

10:00.769 --> 10:02.146
Please, please tell me you're hungry.

10:02.229 --> 10:04.189
This food is filled with toxins.

10:04.273 --> 10:07.151
- [both laugh]
- [Miles] Great, more toxins for me.

10:11.946 --> 10:14.199
I will have an enchilada...

10:15.159 --> 10:18.245
[chuckling] and, uh... nachos.

10:18.328 --> 10:20.414
That's definitely nachos, yeah.

10:23.042 --> 10:24.168
You're not welcome here.

10:24.251 --> 10:25.502
[chuckles]

10:25.585 --> 10:27.754
Ooh. Role reversal.

10:27.837 --> 10:29.464
- Fun.
- You can go, too.

10:29.548 --> 10:31.258
What's your damage?

10:31.341 --> 10:32.884
You sent junk pics to
my girlfriend last night.

10:32.967 --> 10:34.469
[chuckles] I did not.

10:34.553 --> 10:36.471
Who's your girlfriend?

10:36.555 --> 10:38.640
- Lola.
- [both laugh]

10:40.267 --> 10:43.103
[chuckles] Oh, I look
really good in this one.

10:43.187 --> 10:44.188
Get that out of my face, loser.

10:44.271 --> 10:46.065
Oh, you don't want to see
what has your girlfriend

10:46.148 --> 10:47.774
so hot and bothered?

10:47.857 --> 10:48.942
Come on, you know you want to.

10:49.026 --> 10:50.360
Look, just get out of here, okay?

10:50.444 --> 10:53.613
Or you're holding out
for the real thing, huh?

10:53.697 --> 10:55.490
[giggles] Prepare to be amazed.

10:58.368 --> 10:59.536
[all gasp]

11:00.079 --> 11:01.788
I wonder if he'll remember that.

11:02.789 --> 11:04.499
[movie playing on TV]

11:06.043 --> 11:07.627
[knocking on door]

11:07.711 --> 11:08.878
[door opens]

11:10.589 --> 11:14.008
Mom's home, which means this party is over.

11:14.373 --> 11:15.832
[sighs]

11:16.560 --> 11:17.978
All right, later.

11:18.834 --> 11:20.545
I'm gonna go stare at my phone.

11:24.006 --> 11:26.884
Guess I'll see you at school.

11:26.967 --> 11:29.053
Unless you wanna sleep over?

11:29.970 --> 11:31.263
[chuckles softly]

11:35.100 --> 11:36.602
[machine whirring]

11:38.313 --> 11:39.980
[inhaling deeply]

11:46.321 --> 11:47.613
You all done?

11:47.697 --> 11:49.281
[machine stops]

11:49.365 --> 11:50.741
Yeah.

11:50.825 --> 11:53.160
Uh, my mom left you those.

11:54.704 --> 11:56.080
Thanks.

11:57.707 --> 11:59.334
Should I change here?

12:00.250 --> 12:02.294
Uh, I... I can turn around.

12:02.378 --> 12:04.213
No, don't.

12:06.006 --> 12:07.842
Unless you want to.

12:11.387 --> 12:13.348
Why is this so weird? [sighs]

12:15.182 --> 12:18.310
Because we're friends and
I want it to stay that way,

12:18.394 --> 12:19.854
no matter what happens.

12:21.105 --> 12:25.610
Does that mean you want
something to happen?

12:25.693 --> 12:27.862
I've never felt this close to anyone.

12:28.779 --> 12:30.906
What if it messes everything up?

12:31.782 --> 12:32.908
I won't let it.

12:38.414 --> 12:41.709
Maybe let's forget about
the pajamas. [chuckles]

12:49.341 --> 12:50.801
[beeping]

13:00.227 --> 13:03.689
Well, it was a minor concussion, but
you should look out for complications.

13:03.773 --> 13:05.315
Thanks. It's been swell.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.611
Uh, not so fast. You're a minor.
You need someone to sign you out.

13:10.154 --> 13:14.324
Well, my folks are at some fancy
benefit. They're very hard to reach.

13:14.409 --> 13:16.702
Miles, are you okay?

13:16.786 --> 13:18.746
I'm his mother. Is he okay?

13:18.829 --> 13:19.955
His head is fine,

13:20.039 --> 13:22.124
but I have some concerns
about his blood work.

13:23.042 --> 13:24.794
What type of concerns?

13:24.877 --> 13:26.295
Let's find a room to talk.

13:43.353 --> 13:46.356
So, do you think your mom will let
us have another sleepover tonight?

13:46.441 --> 13:47.608
[chuckles]

13:49.944 --> 13:53.072
Oh, you're right. We should
keep things undercover.

13:53.155 --> 13:56.200
Secrets are super sexy. [chuckles softly]

13:58.410 --> 14:00.704
What's wrong? Did your mom hear us?

14:02.457 --> 14:04.959
You know you're, like, one
of the only people I trust.

14:05.042 --> 14:07.503
- Stop sugarcoating.
- But...

14:07.587 --> 14:08.796
This...

14:10.047 --> 14:11.340
We can't work.

14:12.675 --> 14:15.302
[scoffs] You're scared.
I knew you would be.

14:15.385 --> 14:16.512
That's not the problem.

14:17.304 --> 14:18.598
Then what is?

14:23.603 --> 14:25.521
I'm not gay.

14:25.605 --> 14:27.565
I'm sorry. I tried for you.

14:29.022 --> 14:30.273
You're my best friend.

14:32.319 --> 14:34.279
That was my first time with
a girl. Maybe we did it wrong.

14:34.363 --> 14:36.323
What part didn't you like?

14:36.406 --> 14:37.700
All of it.

14:38.909 --> 14:39.994
[breath trembles]

14:40.077 --> 14:42.830
[stammering] No. No, I was there.

14:42.913 --> 14:45.165
I know what I felt. I
know you felt it, too.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.714
Name one guy you've ever liked.

14:57.011 --> 14:58.178
Zig.

15:07.980 --> 15:10.149
This is so stupid. I'm going home.

15:10.232 --> 15:12.735
Please, cooperate with the doctor.

15:14.069 --> 15:15.112
Fine.

15:15.195 --> 15:17.698
You want to know if I'm
trying to kill myself?

15:17.782 --> 15:19.449
- The answer's yes.
- Oh, my God.

15:19.534 --> 15:22.327
I'm so depressed, I can
barely get out of bed anymore.

15:22.411 --> 15:25.831
[breathing heavily] But there's
one thing that might help...

15:27.500 --> 15:28.834
and I think it's Clonazepam.

15:28.918 --> 15:31.546
Do you know what was in your system
when you came to the hospital?

15:31.629 --> 15:35.841
Benzos, sleeping pills, alcohol,
MDMA, horse tranquilizer...

15:35.925 --> 15:37.760
- [Mrs. Hollingsworth] Horse tranquilizer?
- No, no, no, no.

15:37.843 --> 15:39.303
There's no way. You must
have the wrong chart.

15:39.386 --> 15:41.388
You ever buy a pill at a
club? It's a common additive.

15:41.471 --> 15:44.016
This is so much worse than I
thought. We have to get you better.

15:44.099 --> 15:45.726
The drugs make me better.

15:45.810 --> 15:47.477
Miles, they're going to kill you.

15:47.562 --> 15:50.397
Then you'll just have the happy little
family you've always wanted, right?

15:51.941 --> 15:53.067
That's not true.

15:53.150 --> 15:54.777
Yes, it is. You don't care.

15:54.860 --> 15:56.445
- I do.
- No, you don't.

15:57.362 --> 15:58.948
You brought Dad back.

15:59.031 --> 16:00.365
[breath trembling]

16:00.449 --> 16:02.284
And when I'm around him, I can't breathe,

16:02.367 --> 16:06.080
and I tell you that all the
time and you don't listen to me.

16:07.206 --> 16:12.795
[voice breaking] And these drugs are the
only way that I can make anything better.

16:12.878 --> 16:15.005
[panting] And they're the
only way that I have control.

16:15.089 --> 16:17.382
But they're the ones controlling you.

16:17.466 --> 16:18.676
Look at your leg.

16:18.759 --> 16:22.930
That shaking is a withdrawal symptom.
It's your body demanding more drugs.

16:23.013 --> 16:24.264
And the more you take, the more you need,

16:24.348 --> 16:26.516
until one day, you'll take too much.

16:26.601 --> 16:28.227
So I ask again...

16:29.144 --> 16:30.896
Do you wanna die?

16:32.272 --> 16:35.192
[stuttering] I can't stop. I don't...

16:35.275 --> 16:37.194
I don't know what to do.

16:37.277 --> 16:38.988
- [Mrs. Hollingsworth] Just accept help.
- [sobs]

16:39.905 --> 16:42.032
[breath trembles] Please.

16:44.952 --> 16:46.536

16:46.621 --> 16:50.207

16:52.710 --> 16:55.630

16:58.716 --> 17:01.886
<i>♪ Tell me, is it

17:04.888 --> 17:06.348
Thanks for coming all this way.

17:07.892 --> 17:10.310
Uh, we have other songs.

17:10.394 --> 17:12.061
Do you want something faster? Slower?

17:12.146 --> 17:13.355
Well, you're the artist. You tell me.

17:14.147 --> 17:15.858
[stutters] I don't understand.

17:15.941 --> 17:18.443
That track you played,
hundreds could write it.

17:18.527 --> 17:20.444
And more could sing it, better than you.

17:20.529 --> 17:21.656
So I'm not good enough?

17:21.739 --> 17:23.115
You wrote one track that cut through.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.117
It's not enough.

17:26.201 --> 17:27.536
[sighs]

17:28.621 --> 17:30.122
It was nice meeting you.

17:33.542 --> 17:34.919
Geez, what a jerk.

17:35.961 --> 17:37.087
[Maya sighs]

17:40.925 --> 17:44.011
We have a few hours left in New
York. What do you want to do?

17:44.094 --> 17:45.846
Just leave me alone with
my humiliation, okay?

17:45.930 --> 17:48.015
No, not okay.

17:48.098 --> 17:49.767
Don't say I'm overreacting.

17:49.850 --> 17:52.436
- You have one great song.
- Yeah, what if I'm just a one-hit wonder?

17:52.519 --> 17:55.355
Mmm, let's not get ahead of
yourself. Your song's not a hit yet.

17:55.439 --> 17:56.691
[chuckles]

17:57.607 --> 18:00.444
So, may I interest you in some sightseeing?

18:01.403 --> 18:03.781
Actually, there is something
that I'd like to do.

18:03.864 --> 18:05.783
Yeah? Okay, but first...

18:06.701 --> 18:08.202
- Come on, come on.
- [scoffs]

18:09.787 --> 18:11.080
- [chuckles]
- [shutter clicks]

18:11.163 --> 18:12.790
So, this is before

18:12.873 --> 18:14.959
and... after.

18:15.042 --> 18:16.669
Can you believe it's still me?

18:16.752 --> 18:18.587
- Um, we pretty much chose an image
- _

18:18.671 --> 18:21.215
that reflected my slender
frame as much as possible,

18:21.298 --> 18:23.884
- so that we could emphasize the changes made.
- _

18:23.968 --> 18:26.470
In the end, we're left with
a bodybuild cover photo,

18:26.553 --> 18:29.098
- which is almost 100% artificial.
- _

18:29.181 --> 18:30.265
Thank you very much.

18:30.349 --> 18:32.059
[bell ringing]

18:36.021 --> 18:37.356
Whoa!

18:37.439 --> 18:38.983
Watch where you're going!

18:39.066 --> 18:40.359
[sighs]

18:40.442 --> 18:43.153
Hey! Don't you dare
ignore me! I have feelings!

18:46.365 --> 18:47.574
Should I get Grace?

18:48.701 --> 18:51.245
No, I just need to get out of here.

18:54.581 --> 18:56.208
Whose face is on that bottle?

18:57.126 --> 19:00.462
Just another person who will never
love me the way that I love them.

19:00.545 --> 19:02.798
Yeah, well, we should form a club.

19:04.674 --> 19:06.969
No way. Maya is head over heels.

19:07.052 --> 19:08.804
Yeah, well, then, why
won't she return my texts?

19:08.888 --> 19:11.265
It's been a day. She's
had time to snap pics,

19:11.348 --> 19:13.600
and fave some things,
so I know she's not dead.

19:16.937 --> 19:19.273
I just keep picturing
Jonah and her together.

19:19.356 --> 19:22.860
It's only a matter of time.
Maya's going places and I'm not.

19:22.943 --> 19:26.446
Nothing hurts more than imagining
the girl you love with someone else.

19:28.615 --> 19:30.034
[Zig sighs heavily]

19:35.289 --> 19:36.498
[phone clicks]

19:47.301 --> 19:49.261
I know a girl that's wanted you forever.

19:50.179 --> 19:51.263
Yeah, who?

19:55.350 --> 19:56.769
Whoa! What're you doing?

19:56.852 --> 19:58.562
Maya's probably getting
hot and heavy with Jonah.

19:58.645 --> 20:00.605
I am here and I want you.

20:03.233 --> 20:04.902
Wait, whoa. Are you sure?

20:06.570 --> 20:07.780
Yes.

20:14.787 --> 20:15.996
[Mrs. Hollingsworth] Eat some breakfast.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.248
We need to leave for the appointment soon.

20:23.796 --> 20:26.090
Ooh! Did you have these
flown in from Paris?

20:28.550 --> 20:30.177
What are you doing?

20:30.260 --> 20:32.096
I was worried. I came to check in on you.

20:32.179 --> 20:33.638
Is that allowed?

20:33.722 --> 20:35.808
Well, I'm... I'm fine. You can go, now.

20:35.891 --> 20:37.184
And skip out on this spread?

20:37.267 --> 20:39.144
There are, like, eight types of jam.

20:39.228 --> 20:42.481
- Please, Esme.
- [scoffs] What is your problem?

20:43.273 --> 20:45.692
Uh... I'm an addict.

20:45.775 --> 20:47.987
[chuckles] Is that what
some quack told you?

20:48.070 --> 20:52.116
I'm meeting with an addiction
counselor today, and...

20:53.283 --> 20:54.451
he'll help me stop.

20:54.534 --> 20:55.702
And...

20:56.829 --> 20:58.705
I can't hang out with you anymore.

20:59.498 --> 21:01.500
[scoffs] Because I'm an enabler?

21:01.583 --> 21:04.536
Yeah, I know the psychobabble.

21:05.087 --> 21:06.213
I wanna get better.

21:06.505 --> 21:08.382
Don't be such a square.

21:09.799 --> 21:11.510
- [sighs]
- Whatever.

21:11.593 --> 21:14.721
You have no friends and a crap family.

21:14.804 --> 21:16.306
You'll come back.

21:16.390 --> 21:17.641
And when you do...

21:18.976 --> 21:20.936
[inhales] who knows where I'll be?

21:24.773 --> 21:27.234
- [indistinct announcement on PA]
- [indistinct chatter]

21:27.317 --> 21:30.737
[sighs] I understand if you
don't want to be partners anymore.

21:31.947 --> 21:33.823
I just hope that one day
we can still be friends.

21:33.908 --> 21:35.367
I emailed you my part.

21:39.997 --> 21:42.166
This is a video, not a JPEG.

21:48.964 --> 21:50.465
[sighing angrily]

21:55.470 --> 21:58.098
- Hey, you.
- You're back?

21:58.182 --> 22:01.393
Yeah, I texted you, like, a
million times from the road.

22:01.476 --> 22:02.852
My screen is busted.

22:02.937 --> 22:04.521
- [sighs] Oh!
- My phone's in the shop.

22:04.604 --> 22:06.856
I thought you were mad at me
because I turned my phone off.

22:06.941 --> 22:08.984
I was just so stressed and I had to focus.

22:09.068 --> 22:10.777
[inhaling deeply] But, I'm here now.

22:10.860 --> 22:12.905
