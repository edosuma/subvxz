WEBVTT

02:36.907 --> 02:47.166
There's a bright golden haze
on the meadow

02:47.251 --> 02:53.464
The corn is as high
as an elephant's eye

02:53.549 --> 03:01.556
And it looks like it's climbin'
clear up to the sky

03:01.640 --> 03:06.227
Oh, what a beautiful morning

03:06.311 --> 03:10.857
Oh, what a beautiful day

03:10.941 --> 03:15.486
I got a beautiful feeling

03:15.571 --> 03:20.116
Everything's goin' my way

03:20.242 --> 03:23.119
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

03:23.954 --> 03:32.128
All the sounds of the earth
are like music

03:32.254 --> 03:38.676
The breeze is so busy
it don't miss a tree

03:38.760 --> 03:47.268
And a ol' weepin' willer
is laughin' at me

03:47.436 --> 03:51.689
Oh, what a beautiful morning

03:51.857 --> 03:56.903
Oh, what a beautiful day

03:56.987 --> 04:02.033
I got a beautiful feeling

04:02.117 --> 04:08.956
Everything's goin' my way

04:09.041 --> 04:18.925
Oh, what a beautiful day

04:23.805 --> 04:25.765
(ROOSTER CROWS)

04:28.852 --> 04:30.895
(CHICKENS CLUCKING)

04:50.707 --> 04:53.292
- Hi, Aunt Eller!
- Don't scare me to death.

04:53.377 --> 04:56.796
- What you doin' around here?
- I come a-singin' to you.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.801
Oh, what a beautiful morning

05:01.885 --> 05:06.305
Oh, what a beautiful day

05:06.390 --> 05:10.977
I got a beautiful feeling

05:11.061 --> 05:16.273
Everything's goin' my way

05:16.358 --> 05:20.277
If I wasn't an old woman, and if you
wasn't so young and smart-alecky,

05:20.362 --> 05:24.365
why, I'd marry you and get you to
sit around at night and sing to me.

05:24.449 --> 05:28.160
No, you wouldn't neither, 'cause I wouldn't
marry you nor none of your kinfolk.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.204
- If I could help it.
- Oh, none of my kinfolks, huh?

05:30.288 --> 05:32.540
And you can tell 'em that too.
All of 'em.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.918
Including that niece of your'n,
Miss Laurey Williams.

05:36.003 --> 05:39.380
Who you takin' to the box social tonight?

05:39.464 --> 05:41.382
I ain't thought much about it yet.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.343
- Bet you come over to ask Laurey.
- What if I did?

05:44.428 --> 05:46.429
You askin' me too?
I'll wear my fascinator.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.431
- Yeah, you too.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:48.515 --> 05:52.727
Oh, what a beautiful morning

05:52.811 --> 05:56.897
Oh, what a beautiful day

05:56.982 --> 05:58.899
I thought you were somebody.

05:58.984 --> 06:03.446
I got a beautiful feeling

06:03.572 --> 06:09.368
Everything's goin' my way

06:09.453 --> 06:12.747
Is this all that's come a-callin' at
already 8:00 this Saturday morning?

06:12.831 --> 06:15.041
You knowed it was me
before you opened the door.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.043
- No such of a thing.
- Well, you did too.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.045
You heared my voice.
You knowed it was me.

06:19.129 --> 06:22.214
I heared someone singing
like a bullfrog in a pond.

06:22.299 --> 06:26.427
You knowed it was me, so you set in there,
thinkin' up something mean to say.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.055
I'm a good mind not to ask you
to the box social.

06:29.139 --> 06:32.600
- Oh, you two.
- If you asked me, I wouldn't go with you.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.894
Besides, how'd you take me?

06:34.978 --> 06:37.605
You ain't bought a new buggy
with red wheels onto it, have you?

06:37.689 --> 06:39.231
No, I ain't.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.650
A spankin' team with their bridles
all a-jinglin'?

06:41.735 --> 06:42.818
No.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.571
Expect me to ride on behind
ol' Blue I guess.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.449
You better ask that old Cummings girl
you took such a shine to.

06:48.533 --> 06:52.661
If I was to ask you, Miss Laurey smarty,
there'd be a way to take ya.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.455
Oh, there would?

06:54.539 --> 06:56.332
How'd we get there?

06:58.126 --> 07:02.254
When I take you out
tonight with me

07:02.339 --> 07:06.509
Honey, here's the way
it's gonna be

07:06.593 --> 07:11.847
You will set behind a team
of snow-white horses

07:11.932 --> 07:16.852
In the slickest gig you ever see

07:18.355 --> 07:21.232
Chicks and ducks
and geese better scurry

07:21.316 --> 07:24.235
When I take you out
in the surrey

07:24.319 --> 07:30.282
When I take you out in the surrey
with the fringe on top

07:30.367 --> 07:33.285
Watch that fringe
and see how it flutters

07:33.370 --> 07:36.205
When I drive them
high-steppin' strutters

07:36.331 --> 07:38.958
Nosy pokes'll peek
through their shutters

07:39.042 --> 07:41.961
And their eyes'll pop

07:42.045 --> 07:45.214
The wheels are yeller
the upholstery's brown

07:45.298 --> 07:48.134
The dashboard's
genuine leather

07:48.218 --> 07:51.303
With isinglass curtains
you can roll right down

07:51.388 --> 07:54.515
In case there's
a change in the weather

07:54.599 --> 07:57.643
Two bright sidelights
winkin' and blinkin'

07:57.727 --> 08:00.646
Ain't no finer rig
I'm a-thinkin'

08:00.730 --> 08:03.357
You can keep your rig
if you're thinkin'

08:03.441 --> 08:06.110
That I'd "keer" to swap

08:06.194 --> 08:12.658
For that shiny little surrey
with the fringe on the top

08:12.784 --> 08:15.870
Would you say the fringe
was made of silk

08:15.954 --> 08:17.288
(LAUGHS)

08:17.581 --> 08:21.709
Wouldn't have
no other kind but silk

08:22.043 --> 08:27.214
Has it really got a team
of snow-white horses

08:27.299 --> 08:33.470
One's like snow
The other's more like milk

08:34.931 --> 08:37.683
All the world
will fly in a flurry

08:37.767 --> 08:41.102
When I take you
out in the surrey

08:41.188 --> 08:47.026
When I take you out in the surrey
with the fringe on top

08:47.110 --> 08:50.362
When we hit that road
hell for leather

08:50.447 --> 08:53.449
Cats and dogs'll dance
in the heather

08:53.533 --> 08:56.035
Birds and frogs'll
sing all together

08:56.119 --> 08:58.996
And the toads will hop

08:59.080 --> 09:02.124
The wind'll whistle
as we rattle along

09:02.209 --> 09:04.960
The cows'll moo
in the clover

09:05.045 --> 09:08.380
The river will ripple out
a whispered song

09:08.465 --> 09:11.592
And whisper it
over and over

09:11.676 --> 09:14.887
(SOFTLY) Don't you wish
you'd go on forever

09:14.971 --> 09:20.893
Don't you wish
you'd go on forever

09:20.977 --> 09:23.729
And it'd never stop

09:23.813 --> 09:30.069
In that shiny little surrey
with the fringe on the top

09:31.071 --> 09:33.864
You'd sure feel like a queen
settin' up in that carriage.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.909
Only she talked to me
so mean a while back,

09:36.993 --> 09:39.745
- I'm a good mind not to take her.
- I ain't said I was goin'.

09:39.829 --> 09:43.290
- Well, I ain't asked ya.
- Where'd you get such a rig at?

09:43.375 --> 09:47.253
I'll bet he's went and hired a rig over
at Claremore, thinkin' I'd go with him.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.798
I did not hire it. I made
the whole thing up out of my head.

09:50.882 --> 09:53.634
- What? Made it up?
- Dashboard and all.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.678
(LAUGHING)

09:57.847 --> 09:59.807
Get off the place, you!

09:59.891 --> 10:03.519
Aunt Eller, make him get
hisself out of here! Tellin' me lies.

10:03.603 --> 10:08.315
Now hold on. Makin' up a few "purties"
ain't agin no law I know of.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.485
Besides, don't you wish
there was such a rig though?

10:11.569 --> 10:15.948
You could go to the play party and do a
hoedown till morning if you was a mind to.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.493
Then when you was all wore out,
why, I'd just lift you onto the surrey,

10:19.577 --> 10:24.498
jump up alongside you,
and we'd just point the horses home.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.875
I can just picture
the whole thing.

10:28.586 --> 10:33.632
I can see the stars
gettin' blurry

10:33.717 --> 10:38.470
When we ride back home
in the surrey

10:38.555 --> 10:42.808
Ridin' slowly home
in the surrey

10:42.892 --> 10:48.689
With the fringe on top

10:48.773 --> 10:53.736
I can feel the day
gettin' older

10:53.820 --> 10:58.532
Feel a sleepy head
near my shoulder

10:58.616 --> 11:03.495
Noddin', droopin'
close to my shoulder

11:03.580 --> 11:08.500
Till it falls, kerplop

11:08.585 --> 11:13.881
The sun is swimmin'
on the rim of a hill

11:13.965 --> 11:18.886
The moon
is takin' a header

11:18.970 --> 11:24.558
And just as I'm thinkin'
all the earth is still

11:24.642 --> 11:34.401
A lark'll wake up
in the medder

11:34.486 --> 11:39.656
Hush, you bird
my baby's a-sleepin'

11:39.741 --> 11:45.120
Maybe got a dream
worth a-keepin'

11:45.205 --> 11:49.833
Whoa, you team
and just keep a-creepin'

11:49.918 --> 11:54.880
At a slow clip-clop

11:54.964 --> 11:59.968
Don't you hurry
with the surrey

12:00.053 --> 12:04.431
With the fringe

12:04.516 --> 12:08.727
On the

12:08.812 --> 12:16.944
Top

12:20.156 --> 12:24.118
- Only... Only there ain't no such rig.
- Well...

12:24.202 --> 12:26.245
Why'd you come around here
with your stories and your lies,

12:26.329 --> 12:27.830
gettin' me all worked up?

12:27.914 --> 12:29.998
Who'd wanna ride
alongside of you anyway?

12:30.125 --> 12:32.960
Why don't you grab her and kiss her
when she acts that a-way, Curly?

12:33.044 --> 12:35.754
- She's just aching for you to, I bet.
- I won't even speak to him,

12:35.839 --> 12:37.631
let alone allow him to kiss me...

12:37.715 --> 12:41.176
the braggin', bowlegged,
wished-he'd-had-a-sweetheart bum!

12:41.678 --> 12:44.138
She likes you quite a lot.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.599
She liked me any more,
she'd sic the dogs onto me.

12:48.893 --> 12:52.104
- Hello, Jud.
- Hello, yourself.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.447
Listen, who's the low filthy sneak
Laurey's got her cap set for?

13:01.531 --> 13:04.450
- You.
- Never mind that.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.618
There must be plenty of men
a-tryin' to spark her.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.955
- Plenty.
- What about him?

13:10.039 --> 13:12.291
Oh, she wouldn't take up
with a fella like that,

13:12.375 --> 13:14.293
that bullet-colored,
growly hired hand.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.378
Now, don't you go say
nothin' agin Jud.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.505
Best hired hand
I ever had.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.757
Just about runs
the farm by hisself.

13:20.842 --> 13:23.177
Well, two women couldn't do it.
You oughta know 'at.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.929
He's around
all the time, ain't he?

13:26.014 --> 13:29.057
Takes his meals with you
and sleeps down in the smokehouse.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.187
I changed my mind about cleaning
the henhouse today.

13:33.271 --> 13:36.940
I gotta quit early 'cause I'm driving
Laurey to the party tonight.

13:37.025 --> 13:40.068
- You're driving Laurey?
- I asked her.

13:47.785 --> 13:51.955
Well, wouldn't that
just make you bawl?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.958
Don't forget, Aunt Eller.
You and me still got a date together.

13:55.043 --> 13:58.128
How we going, Curly,
in that rig you made up?

13:58.213 --> 14:00.547
That there ain't
no made-up rig, you hear?

14:00.632 --> 14:02.966
I done hired it
over to Claremore.

14:05.762 --> 14:09.014
- Why don't you go with him?
- I can't. I promised Jud.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.474
Why ever did you?

14:10.558 --> 14:12.601
'Cause Curly's too fresh
and too bigheaded,

14:12.685 --> 14:16.271
waitin' till
the last minute to ask me.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.733
Aunt Eller, are you really going
with Curly tonight?

14:19.817 --> 14:22.361
I sure am. You didn't want him.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.696
But you could go with me and Jud.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.698
You picked your feller, I picked mine.

14:26.783 --> 14:29.701
That's the way
you want it, ain't it?

14:29.786 --> 14:32.996
You're sure a pair.

14:33.081 --> 14:36.208
Crazy young'uns.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.669
Time I started
for the station.

14:41.714 --> 14:45.175
Hey, Curly.
Tell all the folks to stop by here

14:45.260 --> 14:48.053
on their way to the Skidmore party
to freshen up.

14:48.137 --> 14:51.890
I will, Aunt Eller. You see you got
your beauty spots fastened on proper,

14:51.975 --> 14:53.892
so as you won't lose
them off, you hear?

14:53.977 --> 14:56.895
That's a right
smart turnout.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.773
Ain't no finer rig
I'm a-thinkin'

14:59.857 --> 15:02.734
That I'd keer to swap

15:02.819 --> 15:04.778
For that shiny
little surrey

on the top

15:44.402 --> 15:46.403
Aunt Eller!

16:27.987 --> 16:29.946
Lookin' for me?

16:35.411 --> 16:37.996
Gonna be a nice evenin'
for the party.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.540
- Jud.
- What?

16:40.625 --> 16:44.169
I don't think
I can...

16:44.253 --> 16:46.213
You ain't figurin' on goin'
with someone else, are you?

16:48.299 --> 16:50.258
Well, I...

16:52.053 --> 16:53.970
Laurey!

16:56.974 --> 16:59.309
I'll come by for you
along around about sundown.

What'd you do up at the fair, Will?
Bust any bones?

17:39.517 --> 17:43.687
Aw, too smart for that.
Just made sure I landed on my head.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.689
- Will Parker.
- Hi, Aunt Eller.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.066
If you ain't got them fancy lanterns
for the Skidmore party,

17:48.151 --> 17:50.402
- get back on that train.
- (LAUGHS)

17:50.486 --> 17:53.238
- Here you are.
- You do any good in the steer ropin', Will?

17:53.322 --> 17:56.032
Oh, I did pretty good.
I won prize money.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.910
- That's my boy.
- I've got to get over to Ado Annie's.

17:58.995 --> 18:02.539
Her pa said I could have her
if'n I was ever worth $50.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.541
And I got that $50.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.919
If Annie's pa
keeps his promise,

18:08.004 --> 18:09.921
we'll be dancin'
at your wedding.

18:10.006 --> 18:13.467
If'n he don't, I'll take her right
from under his nose.

18:13.551 --> 18:16.094
Besides which, I won't give him
the present I brung for him.

18:16.179 --> 18:20.015
Looky here, fellas,
what I got for Ado Annie's pa.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.602
Excuse us, Aunt Eller.
You hold it up to your eye like this, see.

18:23.686 --> 18:27.314
Then when you get a good look, you turn it
around at the top and the picture changes.

18:27.398 --> 18:30.734
- Well, I'll be "sidegated."
- They call it the Little Wonder.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.819
Silly goats!

18:35.948 --> 18:37.866
The hussy!

18:37.950 --> 18:40.869
Ought to be ashamed
of herself.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.414
You too. How do you turn the thing
to see the other picture?

18:44.499 --> 18:47.793
- Right at the top, Aunt Eller.
- Wait, I'm gettin' it.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.336
(GASPS)

18:50.505 --> 18:52.214
(LAUGHS)

18:53.216 --> 18:55.926
I'm a good mind
to tell Annie on you.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.553
Bet you carried on
plenty in Kansas City.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.681
Well, I sure did see a lot of things
I never did see before.

19:02.558 --> 19:06.436
I got to Kansas City
on a Friday

19:06.521 --> 19:10.315
By Saturday I learned
a thing or two

19:10.399 --> 19:14.069
'Cause up to then
I didn't have an idy

19:14.153 --> 19:17.864
Of what the modren world
was comin' to

19:17.949 --> 19:21.910
I counted 20 gas buggies
goin' by theirselves

19:21.994 --> 19:25.664
Almost every time
I took a walk

19:25.748 --> 19:29.167
And then I put my ear
to a Bell telephone

19:29.252 --> 19:32.045
And a strange woman
started in to talk

19:32.129 --> 19:34.089
- To you
- What next

19:34.173 --> 19:37.425
- Yeah, what
- What next

19:37.510 --> 19:41.179
Everything's up to date
in Kansas City

19:41.264 --> 19:45.058
They've gone about
as "fur" as they can go

19:45.142 --> 19:49.062
They went and built a skyscraper
seven stories high

19:49.146 --> 19:52.774
'Bout as high as
a buildin' oughta grow

19:52.859 --> 19:56.528
Everything's like a dream
in Kansas City

19:56.612 --> 20:00.198
It's better
than a magic lantern show

20:00.283 --> 20:04.244
You can turn the radiator on
whenever you want some heat

20:04.328 --> 20:08.039
With every kind of comfort
every house is all complete

20:08.124 --> 20:11.543
You can walk to privies in the rain
and never wet your feet

20:11.627 --> 20:14.504
They've gone about as fur
as they can go

20:14.589 --> 20:19.759
Yes, sir
They've gone about as fur as they can go

20:19.844 --> 20:23.346
Everything's up to date
in Kansas City

20:23.431 --> 20:27.225
They've gone about as fur
as they can go

20:27.310 --> 20:30.896
They got a big theater
they call a bur-lee-que

20:30.980 --> 20:34.900
- For 50 cents you can see a dandy show
- Gals

20:34.984 --> 20:38.528
- One of the gals is fat and pink and pretty
- Aha!

20:38.613 --> 20:42.240
As round above
as she was round below

20:42.325 --> 20:46.161
I could swear that she was padded
from her shoulder to her heel

20:46.245 --> 20:49.873
And then she started dancin'
and her dancin' made me feel

20:49.957 --> 20:53.376
That every single thing
she had was absolutely real

20:53.461 --> 20:56.087
She went about as fur
as she could go

20:56.172 --> 21:01.217
Yes, sir
She went about as fur as she could go

21:03.346 --> 21:06.389
- What you doin', Will?
- Well, this is called a two-step.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.851
That's all they're dancing nowadays.
Why, the waltz is through.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.896
Of course, they don't do it alone.
Come on, Aunt Eller!

21:19.528 --> 21:23.281
- Oh, that's about as fur as I can go
- Yes, sir

21:23.366 --> 21:26.493
And that's about as fur
as she can go

21:28.120 --> 21:31.039
- What you doing now, Will?
- Well, this here's called ragtime.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.166
I seen a couple actors
doin' it.

21:40.383 --> 21:43.593
- Don't like it.
- Oh, Will, I do!

like this to the end of the world.

Please, Mr. Hakim,
don't start talkin' purty.

Yoo-hoo! Laurey!

25:57.973 --> 25:59.933
Whoa!

26:02.102 --> 26:03.478
Laurey!

26:05.564 --> 26:08.233
- Hello, Laurey.
- What you doing with that peddler-man?

26:08.317 --> 26:11.402
- Will Parker gets back today.
- Will Parker. Oh, foot.

26:11.487 --> 26:14.697
- I didn't count on today being Saturday.
- I can see that.

26:14.782 --> 26:18.243
My, oh, my, Miss Laurey!
"Jippity" crickets.

26:18.327 --> 26:21.496
Last time I come through here,
you was teeny like a shrimp with freckles.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.164
Now look on you.

26:24.750 --> 26:27.835
Quit a-bitin' me! If you ain't had no
breakfast, go eat yourself a green apple.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.837
Are you coming in
or going out?

26:29.922 --> 26:32.674
Standing still while you're here.
Go up to the house and wait.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.551
It'll be no trouble
at all to wait right here.

26:35.636 --> 26:38.054
So much water.

26:38.138 --> 26:40.265
Why don't we all
take a swim together?

26:40.349 --> 26:43.393
In Persia, where I come from,
bathing is a social event.

26:43.477 --> 26:46.854
- Well, this ain't Persia!
- I can already see you two young ladies

26:46.939 --> 26:49.899
in those beautiful
Persian bathing suits.

26:49.984 --> 26:52.652
What do they wear
when they bathe socially in Persia?

26:52.736 --> 26:55.405
- Nothing.
- Nothing. Oh!

26:57.658 --> 27:00.285
The peddler-man's gonna drive me
to the box social.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.370
I got up
sort of a tasty lunch.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.372
But you're promised
to Will Parker, ain't ya?

27:04.456 --> 27:07.583
Oh, ain't what you might say, promised.
I just told him maybe.

27:07.668 --> 27:09.627
Don't you like Will
no more?

27:09.712 --> 27:13.631
Of course I do.
There won't never be nobody like Will.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.967
Then what about
this peddler-man?

27:16.051 --> 27:18.636
Oh, there won't never be
nobody like him neither.

27:18.721 --> 27:22.682
Well, you gotta make up your mind.
Which one do you like the best?

27:22.766 --> 27:26.477
- Well, whatever one I'm with.
- Well, you are a silly.

27:26.562 --> 27:31.107
Well, now, Laurey, you know that nobody
paid me no mind up till this year

27:31.191 --> 27:33.901
on account I was scrawny
and flat as a beanpole.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.029
But then I kinda
rounded up a little

27:36.113 --> 27:39.032
- and now the boys act different to me.
- What's wrong with that?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.492
Nothing's wrong.
I like it!

27:41.577 --> 27:43.661
I like it so much when a fella
talks pretty to me,

27:43.746 --> 27:46.372
I get all shaky
from horn to hoof.

27:46.457 --> 27:48.750
- Don't you?
- Can't think what you're talking about.

27:48.834 --> 27:52.587
Don't you feel kinda sorry for a fella
when he looks like he wants to kiss ya?

27:52.671 --> 27:55.882
Well, you can't just go around
kissing every man that asks ya.

27:55.966 --> 27:57.258
Didn't anyone tell you that?

27:58.093 --> 28:00.428
Yeah, they told me.

28:02.264 --> 28:05.683
It ain't so much
a question

28:05.768 --> 28:10.813
Of not knowin'
what to do

28:10.898 --> 28:14.484
I knowed what's right
and wrong since I been 10

28:14.568 --> 28:17.779
I heared a lot
of stories

28:17.863 --> 28:22.492
And I reckon
they are true

28:22.576 --> 28:26.496
About how girls
are put upon by men

28:26.580 --> 28:31.417
I know I mustn't
fall into the pit

28:31.502 --> 28:34.587
But when I'm
with a feller

28:34.671 --> 28:37.131
I fergit

28:39.259 --> 28:43.012
I'm just a girl
who cain't say no

28:43.097 --> 28:46.724
I'm in a terrible fix

28:46.809 --> 28:50.770
I always say
come on, let's go

28:50.854 --> 28:54.190
Just when I oughta
say nix

28:54.274 --> 28:58.361
When a person tries
to kiss a girl

28:58.445 --> 29:02.073
I know she oughta
give his face a smack

29:02.157 --> 29:06.202
But as soon as
someone kisses me

29:06.286 --> 29:10.248
I somehow sorta
wanna kiss him back

29:10.332 --> 29:14.085
I'm just a fool
when lights are low

29:14.169 --> 29:18.089
I cain't be prissy
and quaint

29:18.173 --> 29:21.968
I ain't the type
that can faint

29:22.052 --> 29:25.430
How can I be
what I ain't

29:25.514 --> 29:27.807
I cain't

29:27.891 --> 29:33.688
Say no

29:33.772 --> 29:37.316
What you gonna do
when a fella gets flirty

29:37.401 --> 29:39.485
And starts to talk purty

29:39.570 --> 29:41.487
What you gonna do

29:41.572 --> 29:45.074
Supposin' that he says that
your lips are like cherries

29:45.159 --> 29:47.076
Or roses or berries

29:47.161 --> 29:49.078
What you gonna do

29:49.163 --> 29:52.248
Supposin' that he says that
you're sweeter 'an cream

29:52.332 --> 29:56.502
And he's gotta
have cream or die

29:56.587 --> 30:00.631
What you gonna do
when he talks that way

30:01.842 --> 30:04.302
Spit in his eye

30:04.386 --> 30:08.139
I'm just a girl
who cain't say no

30:08.223 --> 30:11.642

my favorite food

30:11.727 --> 30:15.771
With or without
the mistletoe

30:15.856 --> 30:19.233
I'm in a holiday mood

30:19.318 --> 30:23.446
Other girls are coy
and hard to catch

30:23.530 --> 30:26.991
But other girls
ain't havin' any fun

30:27.075 --> 30:31.078
Every time I lose
a wrestlin' match

30:31.163 --> 30:35.333
I have a funny feelin'
that I won

30:35.417 --> 30:39.170
Though I can feel
the undertow

30:39.254 --> 30:42.757
I never make a complaint

30:42.841 --> 30:46.844
Till it's too late
for restraint

30:46.929 --> 30:50.056
Then when I want to
I cain't

30:50.140 --> 30:52.683
I cain't

30:52.768 --> 30:54.685
Say

30:54.770 --> 30:58.064
No

30:59.483 --> 31:01.859
It's like I told you, Laurey,
I get sorry for 'em.

31:01.944 --> 31:03.861
And now that old Will
has to come home.

31:03.946 --> 31:07.532
First thing you know, he'll start talking
pretty to me and changing my mind back.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.868
- But Will wants to marry you.
- So does Ali Hakim.

31:10.953 --> 31:13.996
- Did he ask you about marryin'?
- Not directly.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.998
But how I know this,
he said this morning

31:16.083 --> 31:19.043
that he wanted for me to ride with him
to the end of the world.

31:19.127 --> 31:23.548
Well, if we drove only as far as "Catoosy,"
he couldn't bring me home till morning,

31:23.632 --> 31:25.550
and that means
a wedding, don't it?

31:25.634 --> 31:27.677

Remember what you told me?

You said that eggbeater you sold me

I want perfume. I want to be purty.

and you see everything clear.

when she had to decide what dress to wear

or which prince
she ought to marry.

a whiff of this.

- Oh, precious stuff.

- About what, baby?
- About what you meant

34:12.134 --> 34:15.261
when you said that about drivin' with me
to the end of the world.

34:15.344 --> 34:17.847
Well, I didn't really mean
to the end of the world.

34:17.931 --> 34:19.849
Well, then how far
did you wanna go?

34:21.476 --> 34:24.562
About as far as say... Claremore.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.981
- What's at Claremore?
- The hotel.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.150
In front is a veranda,
inside is the lobby

34:29.234 --> 34:31.485
and upstairs, baby,
might be paradise.

34:32.154 --> 34:33.946
I thought they's
just bedrooms.

For you and me, baby,
paradise.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.161
You see, I knowsed I was right.
You do wanna marry me.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.915

- Oh, Ado Annie... What did you say?

34:45.000 --> 34:48.418
I said you do wanna marry me,

It's a wonderful thing to be married.

35:25.165 --> 35:29.043
- I got a brother in Persia got six wife.
- Six wives all at once?

35:29.127 --> 35:31.170
Why sure. That's the way they do it
in them countries.

He's a bachelor.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.678

- Oh!

36:03.703 --> 36:06.664
But if you spent it,
you ain't got no cash.

36:06.748 --> 36:08.916

worth more than cash.

Oh, Ado Annie, honey,
you ain't been off my mind since I left,

36:21.096 --> 36:24.807
all the time at the fairgrounds
even when I was chasing them steers.

36:24.891 --> 36:27.726
I'd rope one under the hoofs,
and I'd pull him up real sharp,

36:27.811 --> 36:31.689
and he'd land on his little old rump
and then I'd think of you.

36:31.773 --> 36:33.983
Don't start
talkin' purty.

36:34.067 --> 36:37.653

Oh, Will, please don't look like that.
I cain't bear it.

50:12.301 --> 50:15.011
Go on up the house
and cool off!

50:15.096 --> 50:17.263
Get along! Mind!

50:18.933 --> 50:22.435
Don't forget tonight at the auction,
Curly, mine's the biggest hamper!

50:22.520 --> 50:23.728
(LAUGHS)

50:31.195 --> 50:34.656
So that's that old Cummings gal
I heared so much talk of.

50:34.740 --> 50:38.910
- You seen her before, ain't ya?
- But not since she got so old.

50:38.994 --> 50:42.247
Never did see anybody get
so peaked-lookin' in such a short time.

50:42.331 --> 50:46.626
Yeah. Says she's 18. Ha! Bet she's 19.

50:50.256 --> 50:53.133
Are you really gonna drive to
the box social with that Jud fella?

50:53.217 --> 50:56.761
- I reckon so. Why?
- Oh, nothing.

50:56.846 --> 50:59.222
It's just that everybody seems
to expect me to take you.

50:59.306 --> 51:02.183
Then maybe it's just
as well you ain't!

51:02.268 --> 51:05.228
We don't want people
talkin' about us, do we?

51:06.188 --> 51:07.897
Do you think people
really do talk about us?

51:07.982 --> 51:10.734
Well, you know how they are,
like a swarm of mud wasps,

51:10.818 --> 51:12.944
always gotta be buzzing
about something.

51:13.028 --> 51:15.989
What are they saying,
that you're stuck on me?

51:17.116 --> 51:20.410
Most of the talk
is that you're stuck on me.

51:20.494 --> 51:22.662
Can't imagine how these
ugly rumors start.

51:23.706 --> 51:24.789
Me, neither.

51:26.625 --> 51:32.422
Why do they think up stories
that link my name with yours

51:32.506 --> 51:38.595
Why do the neighbors gossip all day
behind their doors

51:38.679 --> 51:45.894
I know a way to prove what they say
is quite untrue

51:45.978 --> 51:49.189
Here is the gist
a practical list

51:49.273 --> 51:51.691
Of don'ts

51:51.776 --> 51:55.445
For you

51:57.907 --> 52:00.950
Don't throw

52:01.035 --> 52:05.163
Bouquets at me

52:05.247 --> 52:08.291
Don't please

52:08.375 --> 52:12.337
My folks too much

52:12.421 --> 52:15.423
Don't laugh

52:15.508 --> 52:19.511
At my jokes too much

52:19.595 --> 52:25.266
People will say
we're in love

52:25.351 --> 52:26.684
Who laughs at your jokes?

52:26.769 --> 52:29.687
Don't sigh

52:29.772 --> 52:33.650
And gaze at me

52:33.734 --> 52:36.653
Your sighs

52:36.737 --> 52:40.365
Are so like mine

52:40.449 --> 52:43.409
Your eyes

52:43.494 --> 52:46.454
Mustn't glow like mine

52:47.623 --> 52:54.295
People will say
we're in love

52:54.380 --> 52:57.423
Don't start

52:57.508 --> 53:00.009
Collecting things

53:00.094 --> 53:01.427
Like what?

53:01.512 --> 53:07.475
Give me my rose
and my glove

53:09.603 --> 53:13.189
Sweetheart

53:13.274 --> 53:17.694
They're suspecting things

53:17.778 --> 53:22.699
People will say

53:22.783 --> 53:25.660
We're in

53:25.744 --> 53:28.955
Love

53:29.039 --> 53:32.041
Some people claim
that you are to blame

53:32.126 --> 53:35.378
As much as I

53:35.462 --> 53:38.047
Why do you take
the trouble to bake

53:38.132 --> 53:41.551
My favorite pie

53:41.635 --> 53:44.929
Grantin' your wish
I carved our initials

53:45.014 --> 53:48.516
On that tree

53:48.601 --> 53:51.895
Just keep a slice
of all the advice

53:51.979 --> 53:57.025
You give so free

53:59.153 --> 54:02.614
Don't praise

54:02.698 --> 54:06.743
My charm too much

54:06.827 --> 54:09.746
Don't look

54:09.830 --> 54:13.917
So vain with me

54:14.001 --> 54:16.753
Don't stand

54:16.837 --> 54:20.924
In the rain with me

54:21.008 --> 54:27.931
People will say
we're in love

54:28.015 --> 54:30.934
Don't take

54:31.018 --> 54:34.938
My arm too much

54:35.022 --> 54:37.941
Don't keep

54:38.025 --> 54:41.736
Your hand in mine

54:41.820 --> 54:44.739
Your hand

54:44.823 --> 54:48.785
Feels so grand in mine

54:48.869 --> 54:55.458
People will say
we're in love

54:55.542 --> 54:58.461
Don't dance

54:58.545 --> 55:01.047
All night with me

55:02.257 --> 55:10.139
Till the stars
fade from above

55:10.224 --> 55:13.476
They'll see

55:13.560 --> 55:18.147
It's all right with me

55:18.232 --> 55:23.319
People will say

55:23.404 --> 55:26.531
We're in

55:26.615 --> 55:31.244
Love

55:37.001 --> 55:40.712
Don't you think you could tell that Jud
fella you'd rather go with me tonight?

55:40.796 --> 55:42.130
Curly...

55:43.924 --> 55:45.299
No, I couldn't.

55:46.468 --> 55:48.428
Oh, you couldn't.

55:49.930 --> 55:52.432
Think I'll go down to the smokehouse
where Jud's at.

55:52.516 --> 55:56.019
See what's so elegant about him, makes all
the girls want to go to parties with him.

55:56.103 --> 55:58.479
- Curly!
- What?

56:00.441 --> 56:01.649
Nothin'.

56:07.948 --> 56:09.449
(QUACKING)

56:18.125 --> 56:20.835
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

56:20.919 --> 56:22.962
Well, open it, can't you?

56:26.592 --> 56:27.675
Well, what do you want?

56:29.428 --> 56:32.889
Oh, I... I done got through with
my business up there at the house.

56:32.973 --> 56:35.349
I just thought
I'd pay a call.

56:36.560 --> 56:39.729
- You got a gun, I see.
- That's right.

56:39.813 --> 56:42.607
It's a Colt.45.

56:42.691 --> 56:43.775
Oh.

56:47.488 --> 56:49.405
Say, now.

56:49.490 --> 56:53.242
That there pink picture...
That's a naked woman, ain't it?

56:53.327 --> 56:56.204
Plumb stark naked
as a jaybird.

56:56.288 --> 56:58.456
Shucks, that ain't a thing
to what I could show you.

57:01.502 --> 57:04.754
Well, that's
a good-lookin' rope.

57:04.838 --> 57:06.839
Feels good too.

57:09.468 --> 57:10.676
(GRUNTS)

57:11.178 --> 57:14.013
That's a good, strong hook
you got there, Jud.

57:17.518 --> 57:20.853
You know what?
You could hang yourself on that.

57:20.938 --> 57:23.731
- I could what?
- You could hang yourself.

57:25.150 --> 57:28.736
Yes, sir.
Easy as rollin' off a log.

57:28.821 --> 57:31.322
Why, in five minutes
or less, with good luck,

57:31.406 --> 57:34.534
- you could be dead as a doornail.
- What do you mean by that?

57:34.618 --> 57:37.203
Oh, then folks would
come to your funeral.

57:38.664 --> 57:40.748
- And they'd sing sad songs.
- (SCOFFS)

57:40.833 --> 57:42.750
Why, they would.

57:42.835 --> 57:46.379
You never know how many people
like you till you're dead.

57:47.840 --> 57:49.757
You'd be laid out
in a parlor.

57:49.842 --> 57:52.093
All decked out
in your best suit.

57:52.177 --> 57:55.429
Your hair combed down slick,
high starched collar.

57:55.514 --> 57:58.432
Lots of pretty flowers
all around you.

57:58.517 --> 58:00.434
Would there be flowers,
you think?

58:00.519 --> 58:02.436
And palms too,

58:02.521 --> 58:05.189
all around your coffin.

58:05.274 --> 58:08.860
Folks would gather round,
and men would bare their heads.

58:08.944 --> 58:11.028
Women would sniffle softly.

58:11.113 --> 58:13.030
Some probably even faint,

58:13.115 --> 58:15.366
ones that took a shine to you
whilst you was alive.

58:15.450 --> 58:17.702
Now, what women
ever took a shine to me?

58:17.786 --> 58:20.037
Why, lots of women.

58:20.122 --> 58:22.206
Only they never come right out
and tell you how they feel,

58:22.291 --> 58:24.876
unless you die first.

58:24.960 --> 58:27.378
I guess maybe
you're right.

58:27.462 --> 58:30.715
They'd sure sing loud,
though, when the singin' would start.

58:30.799 --> 58:34.385
Sing like their hearts
would break.

58:35.137 --> 58:37.763
Poor Jud is dead

58:37.848 --> 58:42.059
Poor Jud Fry is dead

58:42.144 --> 58:47.982
All gather round
his coffin now and cry

58:49.651 --> 58:52.904
He had a heart of gold

58:52.988 --> 58:57.241
And he wasn't very old

58:57.326 --> 59:03.164
Oh, why did such a fella
have to die

59:05.167 --> 59:07.919
Poor Jud is dead

59:08.003 --> 59:12.423
Poor Jud Fry is dead

59:12.507 --> 59:17.762
He's lookin', oh, so peaceful
and serene

59:17.846 --> 59:20.389
And serene

59:20.474 --> 59:23.935
He's all laid out
to rest

59:24.019 --> 59:28.439
With his hands
across'd his chest

59:28.523 --> 59:34.237
His fingernails
have never been so clean

59:36.198 --> 59:38.658
And then the preacher'd
get up, and he'd say...

59:38.742 --> 59:42.912
Folks, we are gathered here to moan
and groan over our brother Jud Fry

59:42.996 --> 59:46.457
Who hung hisself up
by a rope in a smokehouse

59:46.541 --> 59:49.460
And then there'd be weepin' and wailin'
from some of those women.

59:49.544 --> 59:51.337
And then he'd say...

59:51.421 --> 59:54.465
Jud was the most
misunderstood man in this territory

59:54.549 --> 59:57.009
People used to think
he was a mean, ugly fella

59:57.094 --> 01:00:00.513
And call him a dirty skunk
and ornery pig stealer

01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:04.767
But the folks
that really knowed him

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:08.980
Knowed that beneath
them two dirty shirts he always wore

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:13.150
There beat a heart
as big as all outdoors

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:15.653
As big as all outdoors

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:18.322
Jud Fry loved
his fellow man

01:00:18.407 --> 01:00:21.284
He loved
his fellow man

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:23.286
He loved the birds
of the forests

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.079
And the beasts
of the field

01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:27.456
He loved the mice
and the vermin in the barn

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:30.167
And he treated the rats
like equals

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:32.169
Which was right.

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:34.505
He loved
all the little children

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:37.508
He loved everything
and everybody in the world

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:39.510
Only...

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:41.679
Only he never let on.

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:44.390
So nobody ever knowed it.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.561
Poor Jud is dead

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:52.982
Poor Jud Fry is dead

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:57.862
His friends will weep and wail
for miles around

01:00:57.946 --> 01:01:00.573
Miles around

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:03.868
The daisies in the dell

01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:08.164
Will give out
a different smell

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:14.086
Because poor Jud
is underneath the ground

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:18.799
Poor Jud is dead

01:01:18.884 --> 01:01:22.762
A candle lights
his head

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:27.975
He's layin' in a coffin
made of wood

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.685
Wood

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:32.688
And folks
are feelin' sad

01:01:32.773 --> 01:01:36.400
'Cause they used
to treat him bad

01:01:36.485 --> 01:01:42.073
And now they know
their friend has gone for good

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:44.075
Good

01:01:44.159 --> 01:01:46.869
Poor Jud is dead

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:51.207
A candle lights his head

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:57.213
He'd lookin'
oh, so pretty and so nice

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:02.635
He looks like
he's asleep

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:07.223
It's a shame
that he won't keep

01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:09.058
But it's summer

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:13.813
And we're runnin'
out of ice

01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:20.027
Poor

01:02:20.112 --> 01:02:24.156
Jud

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:28.619
Poor

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:36.210
Jud

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:41.340
(CHUCKLES) Yes, sir.

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:43.008
(CHUCKLES)

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:45.803
That sure will be
an interesting funeral.

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.055
I wouldn't like
to miss it.

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:51.934
Well, maybe you will.
Maybe you'll go first.

01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:54.061
Well,

01:02:55.147 --> 01:02:56.522
let's see now.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:58.899
Where'd you work at
before you come up here?

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:00.943
Was up by Quapaw, wasn't it?

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:03.237
That's right.

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:05.739
Lousy they was
to me too.

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:08.325
Always makin' out
they were better than I was.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.327
Always treating me
like I was dirt.

01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:14.039
So, what'd you do?
Get even?

01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:17.960
Who said anything
about getting even?

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:20.087
No one I recollect.

01:03:20.172 --> 01:03:21.547
Just come into my head.

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:26.093
If it come to gettin' even with somebody,
I'd know how to do it.

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:28.345
You remember the fire in the Bartlett farm
over by Sweetwater?

01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:31.098
I sure do.

01:03:31.183 --> 01:03:33.100
It was about five years ago.

01:03:33.185 --> 01:03:35.769
Burned up the father
and the mother and the daughter.

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:38.314
It was a terrible accident.

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:40.149
That weren't no accident.

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:45.112
Fella told me.

01:03:45.197 --> 01:03:49.116
Said that the hired hand
was stuck on the Bartlett girl

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:53.120
and one day he found her
in the hayloft with another fella.

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:56.248
And 'twas him
that burned the place?

01:03:57.375 --> 01:04:00.085
Took him weeks to get the kerosene,
buying it at different times.

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:03.506
Fella that told me,

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:04.965
he made out like
it happened in Missouri,

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:07.051
but I knew all the time
it was the Bartlett farm.

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:32.862
I'd like to say a word for the cowboy

01:31:32.946 --> 01:31:34.155
Oh, you would, would you?

01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:38.159
The road he treads
is difficult and stony

01:31:38.243 --> 01:31:41.996
He rides for days on end
with just a pony for a friend

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:45.416
I sure am feelin' sorry
for the pony

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.626
(PEOPLE SHOUT)

01:31:48.170 --> 01:31:52.173
The farmer should be
sociable with the cowboy

01:31:52.257 --> 01:31:56.302
If he rides by and asks
for food and water

01:31:56.386 --> 01:32:00.181
Don't treat him like a louse
Make him welcome in your house

01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:03.851
But be sure that you lock up
your wife and daughter

01:32:03.935 --> 01:32:06.478
Who wants an old
farm woman anyhow?

01:32:06.605 --> 01:32:09.190
Notice you married one
so's you could get a square meal.

01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:11.025
You can't talk that-a-way
about our women.

01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:12.443
He can say what he wants.

01:32:12.611 --> 01:32:14.278
(CROWD CLAMORING)

01:32:21.453 --> 01:32:25.289
Oh, the farmer
and the cowman should be friends

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:30.044
Oh, the farmer and the cowman
should be friends

01:32:30.128 --> 01:32:31.879
One man likes
to push a plow

01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:34.215
The other likes
to chase a cow

01:32:34.299 --> 01:32:37.134
- But that's no reason why
- (GUNSHOT)

01:32:37.219 --> 01:32:40.721
Ain't nobody
gonna slug out anythin'.

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:42.223
This here's a party.

01:32:43.642 --> 01:32:47.353
Sing it, Andrew. (VOCALIZES)

01:32:47.479 --> 01:32:50.189
Oh, the farmer and the cowman
should be friends

01:32:50.273 --> 01:32:51.565
Good, but louder. Sing it. Sing it.

01:32:51.650 --> 01:32:54.109
Oh, the farmer and the cowman
should be friends

01:32:54.194 --> 01:32:55.527
Sing. Come on, now, sing.

01:32:55.654 --> 01:32:56.987
One man likes to push a plow

01:32:57.072 --> 01:32:58.113
Come on. You hear? Sing.

01:32:58.198 --> 01:32:59.448
The other likes to chase a cow

01:32:59.532 --> 01:33:01.659
But that's no reason
why they can't be friends

01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:02.910
Sing!

01:33:02.994 --> 01:33:07.248
And when this territory
is a state

01:33:07.332 --> 01:33:11.252
And joins the Union
just like all the others

01:33:11.336 --> 01:33:14.922
The farmer and the cowman
and the merchant

01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:18.842
Must all behave theirselves
and act like brothers

01:33:20.053 --> 01:33:25.808
I'd like to teach you all
a little sayin'

01:33:25.892 --> 01:33:28.394
And learn the words by heart

01:33:28.478 --> 01:33:32.314
The way you should

01:33:32.399 --> 01:33:35.818
I don't say I'm no better

01:33:35.902 --> 01:33:40.322
Than anybody else

01:33:40.407 --> 01:33:43.242
But I'll be danged if I ain't just as good

01:33:43.326 --> 01:33:44.451
(LAUGHING)

01:33:44.536 --> 01:33:48.330
I don't say I'm no better
than anybody else

But I'll be danged
if I ain't just as good

01:33:52.127 --> 01:33:54.336
Territory folks
should stick together

Territory folks
should all be pals

Yeah!

01:35:22.258 --> 01:35:23.801
(CHEERING)

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:28.055
Quiet, everybody.
Quiet.

01:35:28.139 --> 01:35:29.681
It's time to start
the auction.

01:35:29.808 --> 01:35:31.892
Who's gonna be the auctioneer,
Mr. Skidmore?

01:35:31.976 --> 01:35:34.019
Why, Aunt Eller,
of course.

01:35:37.649 --> 01:35:39.566
- Say, Aunt Eller?
- Huh?

01:35:39.651 --> 01:35:41.568
Laurey ain't here yet.
What do you reckon's happened?

01:35:41.653 --> 01:35:43.695
Oh, they're just pokey.

01:35:53.331 --> 01:35:55.582
Loosen up
your pockets, fellas.

01:35:55.667 --> 01:35:58.836
You've been pounding the floor
of the new schoolhouse.

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.588
Now let's get money enough
to raise the roof.

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:03.799
(CHEERING)

01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:06.927
Mr. Skidmore's been generous enough
to give us the land.

01:36:07.011 --> 01:36:10.013
- He's got more kids than the rest of us.
- (LAUGHTER)

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:12.224
Now, you know
the rules, gentlemen.

01:36:12.308 --> 01:36:14.935
You ain't supposed to know
what girl goes with what hamper.

01:36:15.019 --> 01:36:17.479
Of course, if your sweetheart
has told you that hers,

01:36:17.564 --> 01:36:20.023
will be done up in a certain kind of way,
with a certain kind of ribbon,

01:36:20.108 --> 01:36:22.109
that ain't my fault.

01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:25.112
I can't hardly lift this one.
Wonder what's in there.

01:36:25.196 --> 01:36:27.948
I'm bound there's
a mince pie in here.

01:36:28.032 --> 01:36:31.702
- Is there any rum in it?
- Well, come and sniff for yourself.

01:36:32.871 --> 01:36:34.246
Is there?

01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:36.373
- I'll vote two bits.
- Two bits!

01:36:41.212 --> 01:36:42.963
Whoa.

01:36:43.047 --> 01:36:45.799
- Hi, Laurey.
- Where's Aunt Eller? And Curly?

01:36:45.884 --> 01:36:47.426
Well, up the house,
I think.

01:36:51.055 --> 01:36:54.141
Sold to Pete Larkin for six bits.

01:36:55.185 --> 01:36:58.312
Well, Pete, you sure got a pretty gal
to go with your supper.

01:36:58.396 --> 01:36:59.688
Well, let's go ahead.

01:37:02.233 --> 01:37:04.735
Now, what am I offered
for this one?

01:37:04.819 --> 01:37:06.195
Anybody just et?

01:37:07.405 --> 01:37:09.072
- I'll give two bits.
- Two bits.

01:37:09.157 --> 01:37:11.074
- Four bits.
- Four bits.

01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:14.411
I've heard enough bits.
Let's hear a mouthful.

01:37:16.164 --> 01:37:18.415
Hello, young fella.

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.585
Well, Mr. Hakim, I hear you got yourself
engaged to Ado Annie.

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:23.587
- Well, I...
- Well, nothing.

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:25.589
I don't know what
to call you.

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:28.592
Ain't pretty enough for a skunk.
Ain't skinny enough for a snake.

01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:30.761
Too low to be a man,
and too big to be a mouse.

01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:34.097
- I reckon you're a rat.
- Hmm. That's logical.

01:37:34.224 --> 01:37:36.725
Answer me one question.
Do you really love her?

01:37:36.809 --> 01:37:38.852
- Well, I...
- 'Cause if'n I thought you didn't,

01:37:38.937 --> 01:37:41.271
I'd tie you up in that there bag
and drop you in the river.

01:37:41.356 --> 01:37:42.689
- Are you serious about her?
- Yes, I'm serious.

01:37:42.774 --> 01:37:46.360
Do you worship the ground she walks on,
like I do? You'd better say yes.

01:37:47.028 --> 01:37:49.279
Yes. Yes.

01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:51.615
Would you spend
every cent you had for her?

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:53.033
That's what I did.

01:37:54.118 --> 01:37:56.537
See the bag?
Full of presents.

01:37:56.621 --> 01:37:59.706
Cost 50 bucks,
all I had in the world.

01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:03.377
- If you had that $50...
- I'd have Ado Annie and you'd lose her.

01:38:03.461 --> 01:38:05.087
Oh, yeah.
I'd lose her.

01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:11.843
Let's see what
you got in the bag.

01:38:11.928 --> 01:38:13.387
Might wanting
to buy something.

01:38:14.681 --> 01:38:16.056
What would you want
with it?

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.849
I'm a peddler, ain't I?

01:38:19.811 --> 01:38:21.895
Oh, hi! (BABBLING)

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:25.357
What a beautiful hot-water bag.
Looks French.

01:38:25.441 --> 01:38:26.942
It must have
cost you plenty.

01:38:27.026 --> 01:38:29.236
- I give you eight dollar for it.
- Eight dollars?

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.738
- That wouldn't be honest. I only paid 3.50...
- All right.

01:38:31.823 --> 01:38:33.907
I said I give you eight.
I will.

01:38:33.992 --> 01:38:39.121
- Oh, that's a crackerjack.
- Take your hands off that.

01:38:40.331 --> 01:38:41.582
That was for our wedding night.

01:38:41.666 --> 01:38:44.251
It don't fit you so good.
I give you $22.

01:38:44.335 --> 01:38:46.920
- Well, what...
- All right, 22.50. Not a cent more.

01:38:47.005 --> 01:38:48.839
(HUMMING)

01:38:49.007 --> 01:38:53.760
Oh, mighty dainty.
Fifteen dollar. Let's see now.

01:38:53.845 --> 01:38:56.430
Twenty-two and eight is 30,

01:38:56.514 --> 01:39:01.602
and 15 is 45, and 50 is 45.50.

01:39:01.686 --> 01:39:02.728
Forty-five fifty.

01:39:04.355 --> 01:39:06.648
Say, that's almost...

01:39:07.692 --> 01:39:09.359
- You wanna buy some more?
- Might.

01:39:10.028 --> 01:39:11.570
You ever see
one of these things?

01:39:11.654 --> 01:39:13.113
- How much you give me for this here thing?
- Oh, no.

01:39:13.197 --> 01:39:15.824
- I don't handle things like that.
- It's just a girl in a pink...

01:39:15.908 --> 01:39:18.118
- No, it's more than that.
- Hey.

01:39:18.202 --> 01:39:19.828
Either of you two
see'd Laurey?

01:39:19.912 --> 01:39:21.788
Up to the house,
lookin' for Curly.

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:23.457
- How much you give me for this thing?
- I tell you, I don't...

01:39:23.541 --> 01:39:24.625
What do you want for it?

01:39:26.711 --> 01:39:29.463
Well, let's see.

01:39:29.547 --> 01:39:33.216
- Three dollars and fifty cents.
- Sold.

01:39:41.225 --> 01:39:46.188
Now, 3.50 from him,
45.50 from you.

01:39:46.689 --> 01:39:47.981
That makes $50, don't it?

01:39:48.066 --> 01:39:50.150
No. One dollar short.

01:39:50.234 --> 01:39:52.694
Oh, darn it.
I must have figured wrong.

01:39:53.404 --> 01:39:55.155
Well, how much for the rest of the stuff
in this here bag?

01:39:55.239 --> 01:39:57.491
- One dollar.
- Done.

01:39:57.575 --> 01:39:59.493
Now I got the $50, ain't I?

01:39:59.577 --> 01:40:01.244
Know what that means?

01:40:01.329 --> 01:40:03.288
Means I'm gonna take
Ado Annie back from you.

01:40:03.373 --> 01:40:06.667
- You wouldn't do a thing like that to me.
- Wouldn't I?

01:40:06.751 --> 01:40:09.419
When I tell Ado Annie's pa
who I got most of the money off of,

01:40:09.504 --> 01:40:11.046
(LAUGHS) maybe he'll change his mind

01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:12.756
about who's smart and who's dumb.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:17.427
Say, young fella,
you certainly buncoed me.

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:19.846
(HUMMING)

01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:22.557
Oh. Ah.

01:40:22.684 --> 01:40:24.393
(HUMMING)

01:40:26.771 --> 01:40:28.855
Now here's
the last two hampers.

01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:31.191
Whose they are,
I ain't got no idy.

01:40:31.275 --> 01:40:34.194
The big one's mine,
and the next one to it is Laurey's.

01:40:34.278 --> 01:40:36.113
(LAUGHTER)

01:40:36.406 --> 01:40:38.365
That's the end
of that secret.

01:40:38.449 --> 01:40:41.118
Now, what am I bid
for Annie's hamper?

01:40:42.286 --> 01:40:43.370
MAN: Two bits.

01:40:44.455 --> 01:40:47.708
- MAN #2: Four.
- Who says six? You?

01:40:47.792 --> 01:40:50.419
- Ain't nobody hungry no more?
- (LAUGHTER)

01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:52.838
What about you,
peddler-man? Six bits?

01:40:53.965 --> 01:40:55.507
No, no. I don't care.

01:40:55.591 --> 01:40:57.592
- Bid 'em up.
- Six bits!

01:40:57.677 --> 01:41:01.012
Oh, six bits ain't enough
for a lunch like Annie can make.

01:41:01.139 --> 01:41:04.141
Let's hear a dollar.
How about you? You won her last year.

01:41:04.726 --> 01:41:07.894
Hey, Annie, you still got the same
sweet potato pie like last year?

01:41:07.979 --> 01:41:09.521
You bet!

01:41:09.605 --> 01:41:12.649
Same old sweet potato pie.
What do you say?

01:41:12.734 --> 01:41:15.152
I say it gimme
a three-day bellyache.

01:41:15.278 --> 01:41:17.571
(LAUGHTER)

01:41:17.822 --> 01:41:20.949
Never mind about that.
Who bids a dollar?

01:41:21.325 --> 01:41:22.576
Come on, bid.

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:24.911
Mine was the last bid.
I got her for six bits.

01:41:24.996 --> 01:41:27.581
- Bid a dollar.
- Ninety cents.

01:41:27.665 --> 01:41:30.250
Ninety cents.
We're gettin' rich.

01:41:30.334 --> 01:41:32.836
Another desk for the schoolhouse.
Do I hear more?

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:35.338
You hear $50.

01:41:35.882 --> 01:41:37.340
- Fifty dollars!
- Hey!

01:41:37.425 --> 01:41:40.260
Nobody ever bid
$50 for a lunch.

01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:42.262
Nobody ever bid 10.

01:41:42.346 --> 01:41:44.765
- He ain't got $50.
- Oh, yes, I have.

01:41:44.849 --> 01:41:47.851
If you're a man of honor, you'll say Annie
belong to me like you said she would.

01:41:48.019 --> 01:41:49.811
- Where's your money?
- Right here in my hand.

01:41:49.896 --> 01:41:52.814
That ain't yours. You just bid it,
didn't you? Give it to the schoolhouse.

01:41:53.816 --> 01:41:56.193
I still say the peddler
gets my daughter's hand.

01:41:56.736 --> 01:41:59.780
- Now, wait a minute! That ain't fair!
- Going for $50.

01:41:59.864 --> 01:42:01.948

something about it?

01:54:29.112 --> 01:54:31.030

Well, by gum,

01:55:41.685 --> 01:55:45.271

- Don't mind me cryin'.

Curly?

01:56:19.264 --> 01:56:22.475

01:56:54.925 --> 01:56:56.842

01:56:56.927 --> 01:57:01.180
He talked wild, and he threatened me,
so I... I fired him.

01:57:01.264 --> 01:57:05.518

no tellin' what he might do now.

01:57:05.602 --> 01:57:06.602

01:57:08.313 --> 01:57:10.648
Well, then,
that's all there is to it.

01:57:10.732 --> 01:57:14.193

01:57:32.546 --> 01:57:33.629

What'd I wanna
marry you for?

01:57:37.843 --> 01:57:43.514
Well, couldn't you maybe think
of some reason why you might?

01:57:43.598 --> 01:57:47.435
I can't think of nothin'
right now, hardly.

01:57:49.271 --> 01:57:50.312
Laurey,

01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:54.525

01:57:56.695 --> 01:57:58.571
I don't know what I'm
gonna do if you don't.

01:58:00.323 --> 01:58:04.618
Curly, why, I'll marry ya
if you want me to.

01:58:13.378 --> 01:58:16.881

01:59:02.928 --> 01:59:05.596
