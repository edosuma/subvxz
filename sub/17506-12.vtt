- Hi.

Reagan.

- Hi. Hi, Reagan.
- Hi.

00:21.854 --> 00:24.316
- Nice to meet you.
- Ooh, my God, Reagan.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.652
I've made a lot of mistakes.

00:26.777 --> 00:29.196
But this year's
going to be different.

Happy New Year!

00:36.019 --> 00:37.704
Happy New Year, Mrs. Brinkley.

00:37.870 --> 00:40.449
- Mm, I love you guys.
- Mwah.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.459
We love you, Ava.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.637
2005 was the year of "my bads".

Happy New Year, babe.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.639
Happy New Year, honey.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.933
I just had a revelation
about New Year's Eve.

00:58.099 --> 01:01.478
If you can't drink, it really sucks.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.397
You know, I've made some mistakes.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.147
Right.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.358

that the good fellas
used to hang out in.

We'll just make a meal, and
we'll... we'll slice garlic

with a razor blade, and let it
dissolve in a pan real nice.

Kevin, see what they're doing?

good old fashioned game night?

- Yeah.

watch a movie instead,

No, game night.
That's what we're doing.

Game night!

Okay, well, as long
as you can keep it

We're both in agreement
on that, we hate it?

02:33.319 --> 02:36.907
Ooh, Kevin.
This is so embarrassing.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.950
I was asked to be grand marshal

02:39.116 --> 02:41.787
of the pacific palisades
New Year's Day parade.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.722
Well, not to brag,
but I just dropped off

02:43.847 --> 02:45.090
a bunch of privacy slats

02:45.215 --> 02:48.460
for the dumpster chain link
at the Sherman Oaks Petco.

02:48.626 --> 02:51.505
Mm, privacy slats, are you
freakin' kidding me?

02:51.671 --> 02:53.590
Oh, careful, careful.
Watch the makeup.

02:53.756 --> 02:55.117
Oh, Bart's here to get
a quick pic of me

02:55.242 --> 02:56.709
for the <i>Los Angeles Times.</i>

02:57.009 --> 02:57.969
I hope this isn't inappropriate,

02:58.094 --> 03:00.680
but you are even more
beautiful than Naomi watts.

03:00.846 --> 03:03.350
I get that a lot.

03:07.537 --> 03:10.482
You must be so proud of her.

03:10.648 --> 03:14.528
I'd give anything to wear a
cape and have people like it.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.720
I don't know.

03:15.845 --> 03:18.690
She's just so much more fancy,
you know?

03:18.815 --> 03:21.368
I worry sometimes that
I can't live up to her.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.029
Don't do that to yourself.

03:24.154 --> 03:29.209
You can't.
Who could?

03:29.375 --> 03:31.795
- Hi.
- Well, hello there.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.573
You know what, I can get with
the whole Capelet trend,

03:34.698 --> 03:36.341
but the... I think the wand
is too much.

03:36.507 --> 03:39.127
Oh, sweetie.
It's a scepter.

03:39.252 --> 03:41.471
Have you not been
grand marshal of a parade?

03:41.638 --> 03:43.999
I wanted to know, uh, would
you and Kevin like to come over

03:44.124 --> 03:46.101
for a very old school
game night for New Year's Eve?

03:46.267 --> 03:48.310
Oh. Well, your wish is granted.

03:48.894 --> 03:49.646
Oh. Ow!

03:49.812 --> 03:52.348
No, seriously, a low-key
couples' New Year's sounds fun.

03:52.473 --> 03:53.809
- Right? Doesn't it?
- Yeah.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.794
I mean, no velvet ropes,
no bottle service,

03:56.919 --> 03:58.597
no telling the bouncer
that his neck tattoo is sexy.

03:58.722 --> 04:00.031
Yeah.

04:00.197 --> 04:02.993
Hey, Missy, um, what are you
doing for New Year's Eve?

04:03.159 --> 04:04.369
Actually, just going to hang out

04:04.494 --> 04:07.038
with my lame boyfriend, Isaac.

04:07.204 --> 04:09.499
He's, whatever... I met him on j-date.

04:09.665 --> 04:11.209
Missy, I didn't know you were a "j".

04:11.375 --> 04:13.195
Oh, actually I'm a "Roman c".

04:13.320 --> 04:15.480
But I do love a "j".

04:15.605 --> 04:17.173
Isaac's only half.

04:17.339 --> 04:19.618
Well, why don't you
and your half a "j"

04:19.743 --> 04:22.053
come over to my house
for New Year's Eve?

04:22.219 --> 04:25.181
You know what I'm sayin'?

04:25.348 --> 04:27.175
Yeah.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.852
Mine explodes afterwards.

04:29.018 --> 04:33.231
Rocking my cool party shirt,
my tight party shave, right?

04:33.397 --> 04:34.482
What happened to all the games?

04:34.648 --> 04:35.942
Uh, I don't know.

04:36.108 --> 04:38.637
Honestly, babe, I want you
to check out my face

04:38.762 --> 04:41.072
and compare it to Amy's bottom,
just, texture-wise.

04:41.238 --> 04:42.532
I can't find any of the games.

04:42.698 --> 04:44.451
Yeah, that sucks.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.661
Did you end up checking the,
uh, in the mumble room?

04:46.827 --> 04:49.331
Okay, you literally just said,
"mumble room".

04:51.641 --> 04:53.318
- Hey buddy.
- Hey guys.

04:53.443 --> 04:55.620
- Christopher.
- Hi. Oh, you look great.

04:55.745 --> 04:57.789
Down boy, I'm taken!

04:57.914 --> 04:59.074
Okay.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.051
Reagan!

05:01.217 --> 05:03.161
Let's crank it up.

05:03.286 --> 05:04.763
Wow, dude, I've never seen
you wear a jacket before.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.389
Thanks.
It's for Ava.

05:06.989 --> 05:08.250
Okay.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.085
All right, I don't want
you to freak out, Chris...

05:10.210 --> 05:12.562
- Yeah?
- But I brought fireworks.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.857
Thought we could do a little
display come midnight.

05:16.023 --> 05:16.900
Dude, this is awesome.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.526
- All right.
- You boys.

05:18.692 --> 05:21.062
But seriously, if anything happens

05:21.187 --> 05:25.700
to Kevin's beautiful hands,
I will end you.

05:25.866 --> 05:27.410
Hey you guys!

05:27.577 --> 05:29.771
I'm so happy you're here.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.223
- Oh, yay.
- Yay.

05:31.348 --> 05:35.860
Help yourself to some food.
I also made jell-o shots.

05:35.985 --> 05:38.663
I've got regular ones,
and virgin ones,

05:38.788 --> 05:41.341
for people who just like jell-o.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.968
So here you go.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.552
Honey, babe,
I found the trivial pursuit.

05:44.718 --> 05:45.804
What?

05:45.970 --> 05:48.223
It was in a box marked "old bulbs".

05:48.389 --> 05:49.674
That seems like
an honest mistake, though,

05:49.799 --> 05:51.793
that somebody might make.

05:51.918 --> 05:55.146
Makes you wonder what happened
to those old bulbs, huh?

05:58.108 --> 06:01.069
Oh, wow.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.421
Hey, Happy New Year!

06:03.546 --> 06:05.757
Sorry we're late.

06:05.882 --> 06:08.660
Isaac had to stop
at the grocery store.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.787
Holy Abercrombie and Fitch.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.163
Hi, nice to meet you.

06:12.329 --> 06:14.374
Hi.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.667
Apologies for our tardiness.
I really feel dreadful.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.736
Cool it, Isaac.

06:17.861 --> 06:20.046
Quit apologizing, it's fine.

06:20.212 --> 06:23.591
Man, you are handsome.
I don't know if you know that.

06:23.757 --> 06:26.618
I'm also detecting,
like a, um, like a...

06:26.856 --> 06:28.346
Some kind of a Brit accent.

06:28.512 --> 06:30.214
Let me guess.
It's, um... it's like a slough.

06:30.339 --> 06:31.433
I'm from London.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.227
London-town!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:34.393 --> 06:36.563
Got a double-Decker
bus in the channel.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.648
Okay, baby, you don't have
to fill every awkward silence.

06:38.814 --> 06:42.027
If... I hope it's not imposing,
but, uh, I'm a bit of a chef.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.812
If it's okay, I'd love to whip
up some tapas.

06:43.937 --> 06:47.198
If it's an ass-ache, just say no.

06:47.364 --> 06:50.410
No, it's not an ass-ache
to whip up tapas.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.569
The kitchen's right over here,

06:51.694 --> 06:54.122
and, uh, we also have a loo
just over here if you need it.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.074
You can get one of those on j-date?

06:56.199 --> 06:57.242
Okay, he makes David Beckham

06:57.367 --> 07:00.003
look like an actual pile of garbage.

07:00.169 --> 07:03.548
Yeah, he's good-looking,
and the sex is amazing.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.759
I mean, he can definitely keep up.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.986
But he's a little annoying.

07:09.111 --> 07:11.623
That bitch is crazy.

07:11.748 --> 07:13.325
That Isaac's a great dude.

07:13.450 --> 07:15.393
He said he liked my jacket too.

07:15.559 --> 07:17.295
Oh, no, it's adorable.

07:17.420 --> 07:20.482
I just... I don't know,
I like your usual look.

07:20.648 --> 07:23.151
You know, denim overalls,
denim shirt.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.387
You know, "d" on "d".

07:25.512 --> 07:27.030
Ah, Ava?

07:27.197 --> 07:28.323
There's something wrong
with your hand, honey.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.366
There isn't a shot of Tequila in it.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.701
- Oh.
- Come on.

07:31.867 --> 07:33.912
Got to get this party loosened up.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.372
Well, this was a swing
and a miss, huh?

07:36.539 --> 07:39.459
Aw.
I think you look great.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.544
'Course, I'm not Ava.

07:41.710 --> 07:44.255
Have you any "aluminium" foil?

07:44.421 --> 07:46.341
Ah! We're in America!

07:46.507 --> 07:49.201
We are.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.928
- Okay, all right.
- Ten seconds.

07:54.053 --> 07:55.892
- You have ten seconds.
- All right, um...

07:56.058 --> 07:58.478
Henry VI?

07:59.979 --> 08:01.643
Henry VII.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.483
- Oh!
- Oh, God!

08:03.649 --> 08:05.693
It's his own country.
How embarrassing.

08:05.859 --> 08:07.211
All right, babe, take it easy.

08:07.336 --> 08:09.155
Let's not be the ugly Americans here.

08:09.321 --> 08:11.366
He knows, he knows.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.864
Okay, our turn.
Baby, we've got to get in.

08:12.989 --> 08:15.537
Give me a three, give me a
three, give me a three.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.318
Yes! Yes.
Going in the center.

08:17.443 --> 08:20.250
All right, honey,
this one is for the win.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.709
Good, uh... I'll take, um, geography.

08:21.875 --> 08:25.588
Yeah, okay, if you get this
wrong, I'm going to kill you.

08:25.754 --> 08:27.549
"My wife!"

08:27.715 --> 08:29.425
Borat, right?

08:29.591 --> 08:30.927
I guess.
I don't... was that?

08:31.093 --> 08:32.428
Oh, thank you.
You know what?

08:32.659 --> 08:34.054
I'm just going
to pace myself tonight.

08:34.221 --> 08:36.254
Yeah, I'm going to be
in a parade tomorrow,

08:36.379 --> 08:38.226
so I don't want my fans
to see me puffy-eyed.

08:38.392 --> 08:41.020
Wait, dude, are you riding
with Ms. palisades over here?

08:41.186 --> 08:42.809
Yeah, no, it's just going to be me.

08:42.934 --> 08:44.646
They said I could bring
a significant other, but I...

08:44.771 --> 08:46.681
I didn't think that
you'd be interested

08:46.806 --> 08:49.320
in all that fancy business.

08:49.486 --> 08:50.905
Yeah, why would I want
to be in a parade

08:51.071 --> 08:52.020
when I can stand off to the side

08:52.145 --> 08:53.821
amidst the aroma of cotton
candy and horse crap?

08:53.946 --> 08:55.368
All right, okay, okay, enough
of that, enough of that.

08:55.534 --> 08:57.745
Let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

08:57.911 --> 09:01.249
"What is the largest desert?"

09:01.415 --> 09:03.710
Oh, I know this.
It's, um, Antarctica.

- I will let that go.
- Also put down, "stop saying, 'totes'".

16:07.716 --> 16:10.803
Just "totally" or
"yes" would be fine.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.263
No "totes"?

about the parade, okay?

16:41.958 --> 16:44.128

17:32.676 --> 17:35.796
Kevin, wait.

17:35.921 --> 17:37.798
I need to show you something, okay?

17:37.923 --> 17:41.060
Just... watch.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.771
I put in a search for
"Ava Alexander boyfriend".

17:43.896 --> 17:45.189
Okay?

17:45.355 --> 17:47.208
You dated Bobby brown?

17:47.333 --> 17:48.234
And that guy from <i>ed,</i> yeah.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.144
Well, that's a picture of...

17:50.269 --> 17:51.737
An actual train wreck.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.448
Bravo, Internet.

17:54.614 --> 17:59.186
Look, all of my romantic
failures are on display.

17:59.311 --> 18:01.080
I'm kind of a lemon.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.250
And if you're in that
parade with me tomorrow,

18:04.416 --> 18:08.829
when I mess things up,
every time I Google myself,

18:08.954 --> 18:12.900
which is quite often,
I'll always be reminded that

18:13.025 --> 18:16.262
I blew it with one of the good ones.

18:16.428 --> 18:19.089
You're not a lemon.

18:19.214 --> 18:21.684
Maybe Bobby brown
isn't that great a guy.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.853
I still think it was me.

18:24.019 --> 18:27.732
It's not.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.900
Sweet.

18:30.066 --> 18:31.018
Wait a second, I... I can't do

18:31.143 --> 18:32.236
the fake golf swings anymore?

18:32.402 --> 18:33.354
It's the way that you go, like,

18:33.479 --> 18:35.823
"that'll work," after every shot.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.092
Okay, well, then for you
I'm going to put down

18:38.217 --> 18:40.094
no more taking magazines
from waiting rooms,

18:40.219 --> 18:41.203
because it's stealing.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.264
If the issue is no longer current,

18:43.389 --> 18:45.332
then it is up for grabs, okay?

18:45.457 --> 18:46.333
It's the rule.

18:46.499 --> 18:49.003
Guys, guys, what are you doing?

18:49.169 --> 18:51.028
We are cataloging all the things

18:51.504 --> 18:53.257
that we find annoying and
embarrassing...

18:53.423 --> 18:54.842
And then we're
going to eliminate those things

18:54.967 --> 18:55.843
from our 2012 behavior.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.262
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It's really...

18:58.428 --> 19:00.556
Isaac?

19:00.722 --> 19:01.640
Melissa.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.634
There's one minute till New Year's,

19:03.759 --> 19:06.186
and I don't want
to go into 2012 fighting.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.589
Yes, there are a lot of things
you do that drive me crazy,

19:08.714 --> 19:10.566
but why not focus on the good?

19:11.183 --> 19:13.402
There are so many things
about you that I...

19:13.568 --> 19:14.777
- Love?
- Like.

19:14.902 --> 19:17.239
You never let me finish!

19:17.406 --> 19:19.992
- Just kiss me.
- Okay.

19:21.534 --> 19:23.537
The crowd is revved up...

19:23.703 --> 19:25.331
All right, guys,
30 seconds to the New Year.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.333
Uh, okay, we're
running out of time here.

19:27.499 --> 19:28.834
Are we good with this?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.964
I don't know, I guess I'm okay
with you saying "croissant".

19:31.089 --> 19:32.313
- I mean that doesn't...
- Yeah, you know, I don't mind

19:32.438 --> 19:33.780
you checking yourself in the mirror.

19:33.905 --> 19:35.633
I mean, it's kind of cute,
actually, when you do that.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.593
I'm going to take that one off.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.053
20 seconds, guys.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.155
And you don't have
to see <i>star wars</i> either.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.515
You know what?
Episode... just the first one...

19:43.932 --> 19:46.268
Maybe just the first one
and then the last...

19:49.062 --> 19:51.357
Yeah, I'm basically fine
with most of it, babe.

19:51.523 --> 19:56.604
Five, four, three, two, one...

19:56.729 --> 20:01.450
Happy New Year!

20:01.616 --> 20:03.452
This year's going to be different.

20:03.618 --> 20:05.204
- Are you happy with this?
- Yeah.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.706
Let's blow some stuff up.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.459
I just want to say "my wife"
in a hilarious voice so bad,

20:10.626 --> 20:13.504
but I'm just going to say, "my wife".

20:17.257 --> 20:18.759
Everybody, look out!

20:18.884 --> 20:20.844
All right guys, heads up.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.513
It's the chicken.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.017
Yes.

20:27.183 --> 20:29.690
- That'll work.
- Totes.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.981
- Happy New Year.
- Thank you.

20:37.391 --> 20:39.196
See your auntie Ava on the TV?

20:39.362 --> 20:41.720
Do you see auntie Ava?

20:41.845 --> 20:43.156
- Oh, and there's Ava!
- Look!

20:43.281 --> 20:44.285
This is my boyfriend Kevin.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.692
Isn't he cute?

20:46.817 --> 20:48.581
We're a couple.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.792
Love Boatgavin Macleod,
have you met my boyfriend, Kevin?

20:51.958 --> 20:55.568
I have.
A lot of times.

20:55.693 --> 20:56.630
He's Kevin.

20:56.796 --> 20:59.675
Sorry ladies, he's taken.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.140
Happy New Year, honey.

21:01.265 --> 21:04.210
Happy New Year, babe.

21:04.335 --> 21:06.348
- Happy New Year, Amy.
- Yes.
