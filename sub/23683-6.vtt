00:01.002 --> 00:02.837
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:07.717 --> 00:10.553
Sir, you better
look at this.

00:10.637 --> 00:12.389
<i>...the
first to report the story</i>

00:12.472 --> 00:15.225
<i>- along with an image...</i>
- Oh, Christ.

00:15.308 --> 00:17.102
<i>The photo has been circulating
on social media.</i>

00:17.185 --> 00:19.187
- What the fuck is this?
- No, no, no, no.
This is bullshit.

00:19.270 --> 00:20.271
I just talked
to the hospital.

00:20.355 --> 00:21.731
The kid's in recovery.
He's fine.

00:21.815 --> 00:24.067
See the story about
J.J. Elkins dying unattended

00:24.150 --> 00:27.278
in the hospital? What do you
know about Yevgeny Gromov?

00:27.362 --> 00:29.197
Well, maybe he's turned
his considerable skills

00:29.280 --> 00:30.657
against the United States.

00:30.740 --> 00:33.076
If Brett O'Keefe wasn't
responsible for the fake news,

00:33.159 --> 00:34.953
we need to consider
the possibility

00:35.036 --> 00:36.287
it originated overseas.

00:36.371 --> 00:38.081
So we're gonna blame
the Russians for this, too.

00:38.164 --> 00:41.501
I'm talking about
information warfare.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.755
Andy?

00:45.839 --> 00:47.757
Aah! Aah! Stop!

00:47.841 --> 00:49.968
Last week, you brought
$50,000 in cash

00:50.051 --> 00:53.596
to Hazelton, West Virginia,
yes or no?

00:53.680 --> 00:55.432
<i>That 50 grand was payment</i>

00:55.515 --> 00:58.685
to murder General McClendon
in prison, yes or no?

01:05.233 --> 01:08.820
- Hey.
- I really need to see you.
Are you home?

01:08.903 --> 01:11.281
I should be home
in about 45 minutes.

01:11.364 --> 01:13.825
<i>- You wanna meet me there?</i>
- Yeah, that's great.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.994
<i>Okay, see you soon.</i>

01:16.077 --> 01:18.121
Tell me we got it.

01:18.204 --> 01:20.623
Yeah, but something
fucked is happening.

01:20.707 --> 01:22.333
Well, of course it is.
Two bugs don't blow on one...

01:22.417 --> 01:24.085
Forget the bugs.
It's worse than that.

01:24.169 --> 01:25.837
Watch the tape.

01:25.920 --> 01:29.966
<i>- You okay? You sounded
upset on the phone.
- I'm fine.</i>

01:30.049 --> 01:31.926
Is there any point
where she says,

01:32.010 --> 01:34.846
"I got jumped in the dark
and we need $100,000?"

01:34.929 --> 01:38.099
No.

01:38.183 --> 01:41.060
What the fuck?

01:52.280 --> 01:54.699
<i>He saved our lives.</i>

01:54.783 --> 01:56.201
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:56.284 --> 02:00.580
<i>What was his name?</i>

02:00.663 --> 02:04.209
<i>Carrie, you're not yourself.</i>

02:04.292 --> 02:06.836
<i>But you don't have
my condition.</i>

02:06.920 --> 02:09.339
<i>I'm dealing with it.
I-I've been dealing with it</i>

02:09.422 --> 02:10.882
<i>since I was 22.</i>

02:12.550 --> 02:16.095
<i>She said no one at work
could know. She's bipolar.</i>

02:16.179 --> 02:18.681
<i>The mood of the country,
it's not great.</i>

02:20.016 --> 02:22.685
<i>Civil... war.</i>

02:22.769 --> 02:24.896
<i>Madam President, please!</i>

02:24.979 --> 02:27.816
<i>You have to put a stop to this!</i>

02:27.899 --> 02:30.068
<i>It's only getting worse.</i>

02:30.151 --> 02:32.111
<i>Is there no fucking line?</i>

02:32.195 --> 02:36.491
<i>Ridiculous lies
and accusations.</i>

02:39.327 --> 02:42.747
<i>The White House
is in crisis mode.</i>

02:42.831 --> 02:46.459
<i>I'm talking
about information warfare.</i>

02:46.543 --> 02:49.546
<i>Our country
is under attack.</i>

02:51.005 --> 02:54.384
<i>The time to rise up is now!</i>

02:55.969 --> 02:59.222
<i>I swore an oath
to protect it.</i>

03:01.641 --> 03:04.477
<i>Just think of me
as a light on the heavens,</i>

03:04.561 --> 03:09.315
<i>a beacon, steering you clear
of the wrongs.</i>

03:11.192 --> 03:14.195
Franny! Franny!

03:16.614 --> 03:17.949
- Franny, now!
- She's coming.

03:20.952 --> 03:22.453
- You have your permission slip?
- Yep.

03:22.537 --> 03:24.956
Tell Miss Casey you need another
copy of the math packet.

03:25.039 --> 03:27.542
- I told her.
- Well, tell her again.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.377
Where's your permission slip?

03:29.460 --> 03:31.963
I have it.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.465
Keep your pants on!

03:34.549 --> 03:36.676
- Wow.
- He needs to relax.

03:36.759 --> 03:39.637
- Just give me the bag.
- Hey, hey, hey, hug.

03:41.306 --> 03:43.725
Mm, mm. Have fun.

03:43.808 --> 03:46.769
Oh, Snowflake.

04:01.451 --> 04:04.329
- Anything?
- He's out of yogurt.

04:09.334 --> 04:12.170
- Did you get any sleep?
- Not much.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.005
Look, I was wondering,

04:14.088 --> 04:16.090
is it possible they know
about the surveillance?

04:16.174 --> 04:18.551
- I don't think so.
- You sure about that?

04:18.635 --> 04:20.470
They go out on a walk
or anything?

04:20.553 --> 04:22.138
Mm-mmm. And no long talks
in the bathroom

04:22.221 --> 04:23.640
with the water running either.

04:23.723 --> 04:25.350
<i>I don't want to go to work.</i>

04:25.433 --> 04:27.185
- She's leaving.
<i>- Me neither.</i>

04:27.268 --> 04:30.313
<i>Yeah, you do.
Go take your victory lap</i>

04:30.396 --> 04:32.482
<i>with the president.
You deserve it.</i>

04:32.565 --> 04:35.818
<i>See you later.</i>

04:35.902 --> 04:37.528
Maybe she's too scared
to tell him.

04:37.612 --> 04:39.906
Maybe she's afraid that she
screwed up, blew his cover.

04:39.989 --> 04:42.367
<i>- David, your car is here!</i>
- She doesn't act scared.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.868
<i>- Tell him I'll be right out.</i>
- Plus why call him

04:43.952 --> 04:45.912
right after she gets jumped?
Why go running

04:45.995 --> 04:47.914
right into his arms? I...
- I don't know.

04:47.997 --> 04:50.208
I mean, does that look like
a woman who has to come up

04:50.291 --> 04:52.460
with $100,000 in two days?

04:58.091 --> 05:00.760
You're not gonna believe this.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.553
- I just got served.
- What?

05:02.637 --> 05:05.390
- It's a subpoena.
<i>- You're kidding. For what?</i>

05:05.473 --> 05:10.019
<i>The Senate
Judiciary Committee.</i>

05:10.103 --> 05:11.980
Un-fucking-believable.

05:12.063 --> 05:14.983
10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

05:15.066 --> 05:17.527
What do I do?

05:17.610 --> 05:19.404
Come on.
I'll drop you at work.

05:19.487 --> 05:22.740
We'll-we'll call Todd
from the car.

05:22.824 --> 05:25.201
He'll know a good lawyer.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.704
David. I'm frightened.

05:27.787 --> 05:30.832
Yeah, well, don't be. It's just
Paley on a fishing expedition.

05:30.915 --> 05:34.293
<i>He's got nothing.</i>

05:34.377 --> 05:38.548
- Are you sure?
- I am positive.

05:38.631 --> 05:40.508
Everything's gonna be fine.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.301
I promise.

05:42.385 --> 05:45.179
Come on.

05:47.932 --> 05:49.892
- Oh, shit.
- Wait, what are you doing?

05:49.976 --> 05:51.561
Calling Dante.
He has to know.

05:51.644 --> 05:53.229
Know what?
What are you gonna say?

05:53.312 --> 05:54.939
That Simone's behavior is not
at all what we expected.

05:55.023 --> 05:56.149
We can't let Paley
question her

05:56.232 --> 05:58.151
before we figure out
what the hell is going on.

05:58.234 --> 06:00.278
No, I mean, what are you gonna
say about how we know

06:00.361 --> 06:02.113
about her behavior?

06:02.196 --> 06:05.450
Carrie, you can't tell him
about the surveillance.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.911
Okay, for the sake
of argument, why not?

06:08.995 --> 06:11.998
Because he's FBI. Because we're
breaking about ten federal laws

06:12.081 --> 06:13.291
- with those cameras there.
- But...

06:13.374 --> 06:15.626
No!

06:17.503 --> 06:19.005
Okay.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.802
What?

06:28.514 --> 06:30.433
We...

06:30.516 --> 06:32.518
We always assumed Simone would
run to David Wellington,

06:32.602 --> 06:34.854
and when she did,
it confirmed our suspicions.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.564
But what if that was
our mistake?

06:36.647 --> 06:39.650
Designing an operation with
a predetermined result in mind?

06:39.734 --> 06:41.569
What if it isn't
David Wellington at all?

06:41.652 --> 06:43.988
What if her contact
is someone else?

06:55.249 --> 06:59.170
And then something happened
that blew our collective minds.

06:59.253 --> 07:03.091
October 4, 1957-- can anybody
tell me what that was?

07:03.174 --> 07:06.219
I'll give you a hint.
America's strategic bomber force

07:06.302 --> 07:10.765
was suddenly deemed vulnerable,
sitting ducks on the ground.

07:10.848 --> 07:13.309
Anybody?

07:14.894 --> 07:17.188
Sputnik.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.900
That's right. Sputnik.

07:23.528 --> 07:25.196
On that day,
the Soviet Union

07:25.279 --> 07:28.324
launched the first
satellite into space.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.326
It was barely bigger
than a basketball,

07:30.409 --> 07:31.744
but it was visible at night,

07:31.828 --> 07:34.789
sliding across the sky
like a twinkling star.

07:34.872 --> 07:38.084
Americans soon learned
it had been boosted out

07:38.167 --> 07:39.961
of the Earth's atmosphere
by a rocket

07:40.044 --> 07:44.674
that could also deliver
a nuclear warhead.

07:44.757 --> 07:46.008
Full blown panic set in.

07:46.092 --> 07:47.677
Edward Teller went
on television,

07:47.760 --> 07:50.012
calling it "a defeat greater
than Pearl Harbor."

07:50.096 --> 07:53.266
Billions of dollars would have
to be spent on defense and fast.

07:53.349 --> 07:57.520
By late 1959, my old outfit,
the CIA,

07:57.603 --> 08:02.441
estimated the Soviet ICBM force
at 3,000.

08:02.525 --> 08:03.901
Holy shit.

08:03.985 --> 08:07.071
3,000 missiles
on their launchpads

08:07.155 --> 08:09.115
aimed right at us.

08:13.286 --> 08:17.623
Turns out we were a little off
in our calculations.

08:17.707 --> 08:22.086
Later we found out
the actual number was four.

08:22.170 --> 08:25.006
Four missiles, one of them
operational, probably.

08:25.089 --> 08:27.508
Next week, we'll talk about

08:27.592 --> 08:31.554
the shooting down of a U-2
spy plane over central Russia

08:31.637 --> 08:33.014
and how for the first time
in the history

08:33.097 --> 08:35.641
of the United States,
millions of Americans

08:35.725 --> 08:37.810
understood their president
could lie to them

08:37.894 --> 08:41.230
in the name
of National Security.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.988
Hey, Sandy.

08:52.909 --> 08:53.951
Saul.

08:54.035 --> 08:55.786
Still banging the drum,
I see.

08:55.870 --> 08:58.247
No one's gonna understand
how we fucked up terrorism

08:58.331 --> 09:00.958
if they don't understand that
we fucked up the Cold War.

09:01.042 --> 09:03.502
Buy you a cup of coffee?

09:06.047 --> 09:07.715
If you insist.

09:13.304 --> 09:16.390
So, you were saying?

09:16.474 --> 09:18.809
About Allison Carr
the day you were fired.

09:18.893 --> 09:20.728
Thrown out of the building,
you mean.

09:20.811 --> 09:23.272
I did not go quietly, Saul.

09:23.356 --> 09:25.191
- I heard.
- You know what she said?

09:25.274 --> 09:28.653
She said, "You're not
a team player." A team player.

09:28.736 --> 09:31.822
As if I didn't know
the real reason.

09:31.906 --> 09:34.158
She wanted the Russia desk
for herself.

09:34.242 --> 09:37.578
She wanted the whole damn
division, Saul-- your job, too.

09:40.373 --> 09:43.918
You were in love with her,
I suppose.

09:45.336 --> 09:46.837
Suppose I was.

09:46.921 --> 09:50.132
Textbook honey trap.

09:50.216 --> 09:52.635
You, of all people,
to fall for that.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.512
Meanwhile, she lined us all up
in a row so she could

09:54.595 --> 09:56.597
crawl right over our backs.

09:56.681 --> 09:59.350
I'm sorry.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.686
I should've
protected you better.

10:02.979 --> 10:05.773
Little late for an apology,
don't you think?

10:09.443 --> 10:11.862
What do you want?

10:11.946 --> 10:14.573
Yevgeny Gromov.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.701
- What about him?
- Where is he?

10:16.784 --> 10:19.537
How should I know? He's MIA.
Has been for the last few years.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.872
Speculate.

10:21.956 --> 10:23.541
Well, he might've died,
of course.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.334
Sometimes
the simplest explanation

10:25.418 --> 10:26.877
is the easiest to overlook.

10:26.961 --> 10:28.379
Ivan Krupin doesn't think
he's dead.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.507
Ivan, you've seen Ivan.

10:31.590 --> 10:35.970
Course you have. How is
my favorite handsome hood?

10:36.053 --> 10:40.850
Hiding something.

10:40.933 --> 10:43.686
How I would have loved to
have done his debrief.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.521
It should've been you.

10:45.604 --> 10:48.649
Banished to the halls of
academia by then, I'm afraid.

10:48.733 --> 10:51.986
Might be a second bite
at the apple.

10:52.069 --> 10:56.699
- What do you mean?
- Lucasville.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.701
Fake news that sparked
the massacre.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.372
Oh, now I see it.

11:03.456 --> 11:06.834
- And you think that was
Yevgeny's handiwork.
- I do.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.502
And you want me to help
find him?

11:08.586 --> 11:11.422
- I do.
- Mm. Why should I?

11:13.507 --> 11:16.052
Anybody else would be
my second choice.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.310
Hello?

12:06.394 --> 12:09.355
Mr. Cornwell, welcome.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.107
The stagers won't be here
till next week,

12:11.190 --> 12:13.609
but your message said you were
in a hurry. Leaving tonight?

12:13.692 --> 12:15.569
Charlotte.

12:15.653 --> 12:19.323
It's me, Ivan.

12:19.407 --> 12:22.660
- Don't be alarmed, okay?
- Ivan, you...

12:22.743 --> 12:25.746
That wasn't very nice, was it?

12:27.331 --> 12:29.875
Now listen.

12:29.959 --> 12:31.335
What the hell are you doing?
You shouldn't be here.

12:31.419 --> 12:33.337
You shouldn't be
anywhere near here.

12:33.421 --> 12:36.132
- Be quiet and listen.
- No, you listen.

12:36.215 --> 12:38.300
You will go now.
You will not blow my cover

12:38.384 --> 12:40.469
- if you haven't already.
- Your cover is safe.

12:40.553 --> 12:42.638
You don't know that. You're
still under FBI surveillance.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.265
Which is why there are
two agents sitting

12:44.348 --> 12:47.393
in a fucking campground
in Grand Teton National Park

12:47.476 --> 12:50.271
waiting for me to return
from a backpacking trip.

12:50.354 --> 12:53.983
That changes nothing!
You've broken protocol.

12:54.066 --> 12:57.987
You were not to be reactivated
until next year at the earliest.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.780
I have an urgent situation.

12:59.864 --> 13:02.783
No situation is urgent enough
to risk the entire network.

13:02.867 --> 13:06.787
This one is.
I need to speak to Yevgeny.

13:08.414 --> 13:10.124
- Yevgeny?
- Gromov.

13:10.207 --> 13:13.544
Charlotte, don't play dumb.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.297
I know he's here.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.799
So do the Americans.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.763
Set it up.

13:30.978 --> 13:34.356
- Um, a word, Senator.
- David.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.735
Maybe we could just
step aside for a minute?

13:37.818 --> 13:40.029
Uh... let's do it here.

13:40.112 --> 13:43.240
I'm a big believer
in open government.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.369
You're wasting your time.

13:47.453 --> 13:50.414
- You know that, don't you?
- Always a possibility.

13:50.498 --> 13:53.167
No, I mean it.
Simone doesn't know anything,

13:53.250 --> 13:57.087
because there is
nothing to know.

13:58.547 --> 13:59.673
Scout's honor?

13:59.757 --> 14:03.093
At least have
the professional courtesy

14:03.177 --> 14:05.429
to leave my personal life
out of this.

14:05.513 --> 14:08.974
You mean the same courtesy
you've extended me?

14:09.058 --> 14:12.019
Your committee is investigating
the president, Senator.

14:12.102 --> 14:15.397
It is hardly the same thing.
Nobody at the White House

14:15.481 --> 14:17.942
is impugning your wife
or your children.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.736
I'm only following the evidence
where it leads.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.821
Evidence? What evidence?

14:22.905 --> 14:25.908
This is a civilian
we're talking about.

14:25.991 --> 14:28.369
She is so far outside
the scope of the inquiry,

14:28.452 --> 14:30.829
it is laughable.

14:30.913 --> 14:34.833
I don't think you know her
as well as you think you do.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.460
And what's that
supposed to mean?

14:36.544 --> 14:40.005
I guess we'll find out
tomorrow, won't we?

14:40.089 --> 14:42.007
Sam.

14:43.926 --> 14:46.554
Don't do this.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.514
It's beneath you.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.770
One thing I will say
for you, David,

14:54.853 --> 14:58.232
you've always had
excellent manners,

14:58.315 --> 15:01.277
even when
obstructing justice.

15:13.122 --> 15:15.583
<i>What about
the Palestinian guy?</i>

15:15.666 --> 15:17.126
<i>Couple of months ago?</i>

15:17.209 --> 15:20.337
<i>My donor? Fadi al-Bashir?</i>

15:20.421 --> 15:21.922
<i>You spent a lot of time
with him.</i>

15:22.006 --> 15:26.218
<i>You think he was expecting
some kind of quid pro quo?</i>

15:27.595 --> 15:29.888
Are you suggesting
that I'm peddling influence

15:29.972 --> 15:31.390
or that I'm too naive
to realize

15:31.473 --> 15:33.100
that the only compelling thing
about me is you?

15:33.183 --> 15:34.560
<i>That's not what
I was saying.</i>

15:34.643 --> 15:36.604
<i>I don't offer people
access to you.</i>

15:36.687 --> 15:39.315
<i>Simone, my point is, you're
gonna have to think about...</i>

15:39.398 --> 15:41.483
<i>I know. I gotta think
about all the contacts.</i>

15:41.567 --> 15:44.028
<i>Thank you. I got that.
The lawyer brought it up.</i>

15:44.111 --> 15:47.364
I spent all afternoon
making notes.

15:48.866 --> 15:52.995
<i>Eat. I ordered too much food.</i>

16:02.463 --> 16:04.673
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Janet, it's Carrie Mathison.

16:04.757 --> 16:06.800
Carrie! I've been meaning
to call you.

16:06.884 --> 16:08.636
What an incredible
turn of events, huh?

16:08.719 --> 16:11.972
- Yeah, it's all pretty shocking.
<i>- Your FBI guy was incredible.</i>

16:12.056 --> 16:14.516
I was a doubter. You're gonna
have to forgive me.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.311
<i>- You really brought it home.</i>
- No worries.

16:17.394 --> 16:20.314
So, uh, what's next? Are you
bringing her to the Committee?

16:20.397 --> 16:23.484
We're seeing her tomorrow. Just
Paley and staff and the lawyers.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.611
We'll see if she's willing
to testify against Wellington.

16:25.694 --> 16:28.781
Any chance I can get
into that session?

16:29.990 --> 16:31.742
Oh. God, uh... I don't know.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.994
Uh, Paley can be really prickly
about these things.

16:34.078 --> 16:36.246
- Janet.
<i>- He's so grateful for what
you did,</i>

16:36.330 --> 16:38.290
and I know he's gonna wanna
debrief with you,

16:38.374 --> 16:40.084
- but it's a delicate s...
<i>- You have none of this</i>

16:40.167 --> 16:43.253
without me, and I know the case
in way more detail than you do.

16:43.337 --> 16:45.756
<i>I just wanna sit in the back</i>

16:45.839 --> 16:48.384
and-and make sure we're not
missing anything.

16:50.094 --> 16:53.389
Let me talk to the senator.
I'll call you back.

16:57.935 --> 17:00.562
<i>- ...construction thing at work.
- The entire building?</i>

17:00.646 --> 17:02.564
<i>- They're tearing it down.
- Well, how are you gonna work</i>

17:02.648 --> 17:04.733
<i>with that kind of noise
going on all day long?</i>

17:04.817 --> 17:07.486
<i>I don't know. We're gonna be
breathing construction dust</i>

17:07.569 --> 17:09.822
<i>for three months, and I told
Hector that we need to get</i>

17:09.905 --> 17:12.116
<i>- a temporary office space.
- All right.</i>

17:16.120 --> 17:19.957
Who the fuck are you?

17:50.904 --> 17:55.200
Perfect.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.663
When was the last time
an actual human being

17:59.747 --> 18:02.833
was in here?

18:05.419 --> 18:06.962
Sandy, meet Clint.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.590
He is the best information
scientist at DARPA.

18:09.673 --> 18:12.426
Clint, Sandy. She's the Russia
expert I was telling you about.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.845
Oh, oh. Hi.
Good to meet you.

18:16.889 --> 18:21.310
So, uh, where-where...
where is everybody?

18:21.393 --> 18:24.521
More coming. But for now,
we stay as small as we can

18:24.605 --> 18:27.065
for as long as we can.

18:34.531 --> 18:37.993
- Fucking Janet.
- She's blowing you off.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.120
Some bullshit about how
it's the senator

18:40.204 --> 18:42.748
who doesn't want anybody
in the meeting, but it's her.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.666
Simone is probably gonna
take the Fifth,

18:44.750 --> 18:47.461
- and that'll be the end of it.
- If she's protecting Wellington,

18:47.544 --> 18:48.879
yeah, she's not gonna
say anything, but if she's

18:48.962 --> 18:52.633
working for somebody else,
maybe she drops a name.

18:52.716 --> 18:54.593
You found nobody else
in her contacts

18:54.676 --> 18:56.887
with any connection
to McClendon?

18:58.722 --> 19:00.516
Frankly, I don't think you wanna
be in there when Paley finds out

19:00.599 --> 19:02.017
there's no connection...

19:02.100 --> 19:03.602
...between the murder
and David Wellington.

19:03.685 --> 19:08.357
Finally. "Dirksen 525.
Figured if you came in late,

19:08.440 --> 19:11.276
the senator couldn't object."

19:11.360 --> 19:13.570
I'll let you know
what she says.

19:16.657 --> 19:19.076
If you could take a look
at these,

19:19.159 --> 19:21.036
they were pulled
from security footage

19:21.119 --> 19:22.955
at Cumberland Cash and Loan,

19:23.038 --> 19:27.042
Cash Express, Hot Cash.

19:34.758 --> 19:38.011
And this is from a camera

19:38.095 --> 19:41.890
at Exit 29 at Route 68 West
two and a half miles

19:41.974 --> 19:43.892
from the Hazelton Federal
Penitentiary.

19:43.976 --> 19:47.521
I believe that's your car.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.731
How did you get
in here? I had to put a knife

19:49.815 --> 19:51.358
to Janet's throat to get
a ticket to this thing.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.986
I'm Paley's new best friend.

19:55.362 --> 19:58.031
And this is
a parking ticket...

19:58.115 --> 20:00.117
Okay, I think we've got
the point.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.871
Ms. Martin, conspiracy
to commit murder

20:03.954 --> 20:06.206
carries a life sentence,
you aware of that?

20:06.290 --> 20:07.624
Senator.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.459
I wanna be sure
she understands.

20:09.543 --> 20:12.921
She paid someone to kill
a general, it's a felony murder.

20:13.005 --> 20:15.299
Were you delivering the money
on your own behalf?

20:15.382 --> 20:18.093
My client is not gonna
answer that question.

20:18.176 --> 20:22.097
But you'll confirm that
this is you in the photos?

20:22.180 --> 20:23.557
Let's talk about immunity.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.101
Is she gonna tell us
who sent her here?

20:26.184 --> 20:29.229
Immunity and material witness
protection,

20:29.313 --> 20:31.607
which is going to require some
assurances from the FBI

20:31.690 --> 20:33.275
and the Justice Department
as well.

20:33.358 --> 20:37.613
That's a pretty big ask
for somebody in your position.

20:37.696 --> 20:39.698
Do you think you'll be able
to secure their cooperation?

20:39.781 --> 20:44.453
Ms. Lichter, at some point
we're gonna need to get a look

20:44.536 --> 20:46.413
under the hood.

20:53.045 --> 20:56.298
On March 30, I was told
to withdraw money

20:56.381 --> 20:58.926
from these places
and leave it in Hazelton.

20:59.009 --> 21:00.802
Did you give it to someone?

21:00.886 --> 21:02.471
No, I, uh...

21:02.554 --> 21:04.973
I went to a place
off the Hazelton exit.

21:05.057 --> 21:08.977
There was a specific mile marker
on the side of the road.

21:09.061 --> 21:12.648
And a few feet there, uh,
into the woods, a boulder.

21:12.731 --> 21:15.776
I took a bag with the money,
like a sport bag,

21:15.859 --> 21:19.780
and I pick it behind the boulder
and I drove back to Washington.

21:19.863 --> 21:24.284
So you dropped $50,000
under a rock and drove away?

21:24.368 --> 21:25.994
And you never asked
the individual

21:26.078 --> 21:29.456
who sent you there
why you were going?

21:31.291 --> 21:33.752
Ms. Martin, we need to know
who this is,

21:33.835 --> 21:35.545
or we can all go home.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.558
A government employee.

21:48.642 --> 21:50.686
There's three million of us,
ma'am. That's not gonna generate

21:50.769 --> 21:54.314
the kind of immunity
you're looking for.

21:54.398 --> 21:56.233
A senior White House official.

21:56.316 --> 21:59.027
You mean David Wellington?

21:59.111 --> 22:01.738
Oh, the name comes when
we've got a guarantee.

22:01.822 --> 22:03.323
Something isn't right.

22:03.407 --> 22:05.200
What kind of specifics
are we talking about?

22:05.283 --> 22:09.913
Emails, texts, are you able
to recount conversations?

22:09.997 --> 22:11.915
I kept notes of
the conversations because

22:11.999 --> 22:15.085
I began to have concern about
how secret he was acting.

22:15.168 --> 22:18.213
- "He"?
- No more questions
until we have an agreement.

22:18.296 --> 22:21.550
I need to talk to you.
Now.

22:30.642 --> 22:32.811
- Simone is lying.
- What are you talking about?

22:32.894 --> 22:34.479
She's full of shit, and now
she's lying to a senator.

22:34.563 --> 22:36.398
- We have to pull the plug.
- What the fuck are you
talking about?

22:36.481 --> 22:38.442
- She is not a credible witness.
- How do you know that?

22:38.525 --> 22:42.779
- I just do.
- Based on what?

22:42.863 --> 22:45.615
I was trying to
tell you the other night,

22:45.699 --> 22:47.242
something does not
feel right.

22:47.325 --> 22:50.537
Carrie, she's in there right now
flipping on David Wellington.

22:50.620 --> 22:52.205
- Exactly what we wanted.
- No, you are not listening.

22:52.289 --> 22:53.707
I don't think
Wellington's involved.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.375
I think she's
working with someone else.

22:55.459 --> 22:56.960
- Who?
- I don't know. That's what
we have to find out.

22:57.044 --> 22:59.546
Hang on a second.
Just stop and think.

22:59.629 --> 23:01.757
Now, you're about to blow up
a proffer session

23:01.840 --> 23:03.925
and tell the chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee

23:04.009 --> 23:05.761
it's because you have
a bad feeling?

23:05.844 --> 23:08.096
They are this close
to giving her immunity,

23:08.180 --> 23:10.432
which means they want her
to testify in open hearing.

23:10.515 --> 23:12.559
Open hearing!
At that point,

23:12.642 --> 23:13.977
it doesn't matter
if she's lying or not.

23:14.061 --> 23:15.604
At that point, the damage
to the presidency is done.

23:15.687 --> 23:19.191
And that is on us, Dante.
Our responsibility.

23:22.736 --> 23:24.404
You eat anything today?

23:24.488 --> 23:26.531
Excuse me?

23:26.615 --> 23:29.534
How about sleep?
Are you getting any lately?

23:29.618 --> 23:31.995
I know I've been pretty wired
these last few days.

23:32.079 --> 23:33.330
Do not pull this shit
with me right now.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.332
This is what
you asked me to do.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.209
- This is exactly what
you asked me to do.
- This is not that.

23:37.292 --> 23:38.752
Well, it sure as hell
looks like it.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.837
And you know what? I think you
need to see a real doctor,

23:40.921 --> 23:43.090
not some guy slinging drugs
out of the trunk of his car.

23:43.173 --> 23:44.424
I don't know why I agreed
to that in the first place.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.968
- It's not right or safe.
- Dante...

23:47.052 --> 23:49.137
- No.
- I'm fine. Really.

23:49.221 --> 23:53.016
Really? You're not.

23:54.726 --> 23:57.771
- Let me take you home.
- I need to talk to Paley.

23:57.854 --> 23:59.481
Then do it tomorrow.

23:59.564 --> 24:02.859
Or the next day,
when your head is straight.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.198
Carrie...
you have to go home.

24:08.281 --> 24:11.743
Okay. Okay.

24:11.827 --> 24:14.788
I... Maybe you're right.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.706
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to be such a hard ass.

24:16.790 --> 24:19.584
No. It's fine.

24:19.668 --> 24:21.962
Go back in. I can take
care of myself.

24:23.296 --> 24:26.675
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll go home.

24:29.427 --> 24:31.429
I'll get your coat.

24:37.102 --> 24:40.021
I wouldn't send Garber.
Secretary can't stand him,

24:40.105 --> 24:42.107
Vazquez thinks
he's an idiot.

24:42.190 --> 24:44.109
You're just making more work
for yourself.

24:44.192 --> 24:46.862
You're probably right.

24:46.945 --> 24:50.282
I'm so sorry.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.829
- Take a message.
- She said it's urgent.

25:09.593 --> 25:11.970
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:13.847 --> 25:18.560
I'm sorry. I-I...
I didn't know what else to do.

25:20.270 --> 25:23.315
You okay?

25:23.398 --> 25:26.943
Not really.

25:27.027 --> 25:30.405
I'm in a corner, Saul.
A bad corner.

25:32.073 --> 25:34.784
You wanna walk a little?
I'm cold.

25:34.868 --> 25:36.995
Sure.

25:39.664 --> 25:43.084
About a month ago, I ran into
an old Bureau friend.

25:43.168 --> 25:44.711
We had a couple drinks,
got to talking,

25:44.794 --> 25:46.379
turns out, we shared
a similar view about

25:46.463 --> 25:47.923
what was going on
in the country.

25:48.006 --> 25:51.134
- Not a fan of the president?
- Nope.

25:51.218 --> 25:53.720
Plus he had a line
on evidence which indicated

25:53.803 --> 25:55.639
she was knowingly abusing
her power.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.515
Like what?

25:57.599 --> 25:59.142
Certain memos to DOJ.

25:59.226 --> 26:01.978
He was part of the team
interviewing everyone detained

26:02.062 --> 26:03.813
in the second wave
of arrests.

26:06.107 --> 26:08.360
I opened a secret channel
to Senator Paley.

26:08.443 --> 26:11.071
Strange bedfellows,
you and Paley.

26:11.154 --> 26:13.907
Got everybody released,
didn't we?

26:13.990 --> 26:16.743
You certainly helped.

26:16.826 --> 26:19.537
Anyway, I thought that was
the end of it.

26:19.621 --> 26:22.040
But then General McClendon
dropped dead in prison.

26:22.123 --> 26:25.418
That's... that's when things
started getting really weird.

26:25.502 --> 26:29.881
- How so?
- Well...

26:29.965 --> 26:32.008
We found out
David Wellington's girlfriend

26:32.092 --> 26:34.636
was in Hazelton,
West Virginia,

26:34.719 --> 26:37.305
with $50,000 the day
before McClendon died.

26:37.389 --> 26:40.308
- Carrie, come on.
- You don't believe me?

26:40.392 --> 26:42.060
She just agreed to appear
in front of Paley's Committee.

26:42.143 --> 26:44.020
- What do you mean just agreed?
- Less than an hour ago,

26:44.104 --> 26:46.273
in a proffer session with her
lawyer. She's gonna testify

26:46.356 --> 26:49.067
- against Wellington
in exchange for immunity.
- You realize if even a shred

26:49.150 --> 26:51.528
- of this is true...
- It's not true, Saul. That's
what I'm trying to tell you.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.071
But she's gonna swear
to it anyway.

26:53.154 --> 26:56.992
- Why?
- I don't know.

26:57.075 --> 26:58.576
I-I only know she's lying.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.329
About the money
or about Wellington?

27:01.413 --> 27:04.708
Both, I'd say, but-but
definitely about Wellington.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.584
He is innocent.
That is confirmed.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.878
How can you be so sure?

27:12.257 --> 27:14.551
Because I've been watching him
for the past week, Saul.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.219
I'm up in his home.

27:16.303 --> 27:18.263
The guy had nothing to do
with it. Believe me.

27:18.346 --> 27:20.098
Back up a second.

27:20.181 --> 27:23.727
You've got surveillance
on David Wellington?

27:23.810 --> 27:26.187
On whose authority?

27:26.271 --> 27:27.939
Saul, please. Can you just...

27:28.023 --> 27:30.025
can you just go with me
for a minute?

27:30.108 --> 27:31.901
Go with you?
No, I can't just go with you.

27:31.985 --> 27:34.362
- You understand the position
this puts me in?
- Yes, I do. In a position

27:34.446 --> 27:36.614
to save the president
and possibly the republic.

27:36.698 --> 27:39.451
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- I'm serious, Saul.

27:39.534 --> 27:41.703
At least
help me figure this out

27:41.786 --> 27:43.204
before you sell me
down the river.

27:43.288 --> 27:45.457
You may not like my methods,
but if it wasn't Wellington,

27:45.540 --> 27:47.792
then somebody else took a hit
out on General McClendon.

27:47.876 --> 27:49.878
The question is who.

27:54.174 --> 27:55.717
Well?

27:57.802 --> 28:01.014
Well, I think you just
answered your own question.

28:01.097 --> 28:03.224
How?

28:03.308 --> 28:06.394
If you're right, whoever's
bankrolling this woman

28:06.478 --> 28:09.939
also wants McClendon's murder
pinned on the White House.

28:11.941 --> 28:13.943
So she was supposed
to get caught?

28:14.027 --> 28:15.612
Is that what you're saying?
She was supposed to testify

28:15.695 --> 28:19.324
- in front of the Committee?
- Is it so far-fetched?

28:19.407 --> 28:23.244
Weren't you and your FBI friend
interested in just this outcome?

28:23.328 --> 28:25.914
What's his name again?

28:25.997 --> 28:27.791
Dante. Dante Allen.

28:27.874 --> 28:31.836
Tell me, how'd you find out
she was in West Virginia

28:31.920 --> 28:33.505
in the first place?
- She got a parking ticket there.

28:33.588 --> 28:36.049
No, I mean, who brought it
to your attention?

28:42.180 --> 28:46.267
- He did. Dante did.
- You say you're old friends,

28:46.351 --> 28:48.144
the two of you just bumped
into each other by chance?

28:48.228 --> 28:50.063
When was this?

28:56.569 --> 28:59.572
Right after
I got fired by Keane.

28:59.656 --> 29:01.324
Interesting coincidence.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.328
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

29:05.412 --> 29:08.206
Oh, my God. Fuck me.
Fuck me.

29:08.289 --> 29:11.543
- Take a breath, Carrie.
- A breath? Are you kidding?

29:11.626 --> 29:14.254
- Jesus Christ.
- It's just a theory
at the moment.

29:14.337 --> 29:16.005
No, the truth is ringing
in my fucking ears.

29:16.089 --> 29:17.465
- Listen to me.
- Jesus Christ!

29:17.549 --> 29:19.509
I know how this goes.
I'm CEO of that club.

29:19.592 --> 29:20.927
You have to calm down now,

29:21.010 --> 29:22.512
pretend we never had
this conversation.

29:22.595 --> 29:25.056
- What I need to do is
nail that fucker.
- Carrie, lay low,

29:25.140 --> 29:26.516
go out of town for a few days,
I don't care.

29:26.599 --> 29:29.018
Just don't communicate with him
under any circumstances.

29:29.102 --> 29:30.478
Why the hell not?

29:30.562 --> 29:32.564
Because I'm on to
another situation.

29:32.647 --> 29:34.232
I don't want you
alerting anybody.

29:34.315 --> 29:37.277
- What situation?
- Can't say.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.708
A Russian intelligence
operation

29:51.791 --> 29:53.418
involving active measures

29:53.501 --> 29:57.005
against the president
of the United States.

29:59.007 --> 30:01.509
Wait.

30:01.593 --> 30:05.472
Wait, you think Dante
might be a part of that?

30:07.140 --> 30:09.684
You think <i>I</i> might be
a part of that?

30:09.767 --> 30:11.352
I think you need to keep
your head down

30:11.436 --> 30:13.271
until you hear from me.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.566
Okay?

30:19.110 --> 30:21.946
Okay.

30:22.030 --> 30:24.240
Okay, okay.

30:59.901 --> 31:01.861
He's here.

31:01.945 --> 31:05.073
So, bring him out.

31:05.156 --> 31:07.242
He wants inside.

32:21.482 --> 32:23.067
Mm.

34:28.776 --> 34:30.278
Mm.

34:50.965 --> 34:53.384
The demonstrations in Richmond
were heated,

34:53.468 --> 34:55.261
but they were not violent,

34:55.344 --> 34:59.182
and I am grateful for that.

34:59.265 --> 35:02.643
I hope we can turn our attention
to supporting communities

35:02.727 --> 35:07.190
like Lucasville that have
been neglected for a long time.

35:07.273 --> 35:10.026
In fact, I'm introducing
a bond program

35:10.109 --> 35:12.862
that's going to rebuild
crumbling public schools

35:12.945 --> 35:14.197
all over the country.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.324
Ma'am, Senator Paley mentioned
this morning that

35:16.407 --> 35:19.619
he would like to extend
his committee's investigation

35:19.702 --> 35:21.370
to include the events
in Lucasville.

35:21.454 --> 35:24.749
- What are your thoughts on that?
- The Senate Judiciary Committee

35:24.832 --> 35:27.251
has been struggling
for some time

35:27.335 --> 35:30.254
to find ways to support

35:30.338 --> 35:32.381
Senator Paley's
generalized...

35:32.465 --> 35:36.010
distaste
for my administration.

35:36.093 --> 35:37.386
The FBI made mistakes

35:37.470 --> 35:39.847
in Lucasville.
We are all looking into that,

35:39.931 --> 35:44.435
but turning a massacre
into a political football...

35:44.519 --> 35:48.022
...seems unworthy of
even Senator Paley.

35:48.105 --> 35:49.398
- President Keane.
- Yeah.

35:49.482 --> 35:51.859
Are you aware that Simone Martin
has been granted immunity

35:51.943 --> 35:54.028
to testify before
the Judiciary Committee?

35:54.111 --> 35:55.696
I don't know who that is.

35:55.780 --> 35:59.742
I believe she's an... associate
of Mr. Wellington's.

36:02.203 --> 36:05.957
Uh...
Simone Martin is a friend.

36:06.040 --> 36:09.836
Uh, she was questioned briefly
by Senator Paley today.

36:09.919 --> 36:12.129
But I'm sure there's no validity

36:12.213 --> 36:15.091
to the idea that she's receiving
immunity for something.

36:15.174 --> 36:17.593
It's just been confirmed
by CNB.

36:17.677 --> 36:19.387
Do you think that
the senator is trying to...

36:19.470 --> 36:20.847
I have no comment on anything

36:20.930 --> 36:24.350
related to
Senator Paley's investigation.

36:24.433 --> 36:28.104
But I would love to tell you
more about the bond program

36:28.187 --> 36:33.067
that is going to provide cities
and towns with capital

36:33.150 --> 36:37.488
so desperately needed to rebuild
their public schools.

36:43.786 --> 36:46.539
Simone. Simone.
What the hell happened?

36:46.622 --> 36:48.374
Mr. Wellington,
I'm Ellen Lichter,

36:48.457 --> 36:51.586
- Simone's attorney.
- Can we step outside
for a minute?

36:51.669 --> 36:54.088
I really can't.
I'm sorry, David.

36:54.171 --> 36:57.967
- Are you okay?
- She's gonna be fine.
This isn't a good time to talk.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.343
Can we let her
speak for herself?

36:59.427 --> 37:01.679
Would that be all right?

37:01.762 --> 37:05.182
Come with me.

37:07.894 --> 37:11.188
Immunity?
Immunity for what?

37:11.272 --> 37:14.233
- I can't talk about it.
- Look, if Paley is

37:14.317 --> 37:16.736
- pressuring you in any way...
- You and I just need to

37:16.819 --> 37:18.613
take some time apart
until things settle down.

37:18.696 --> 37:21.115
What things? What'd you agree
to testify about?

37:21.198 --> 37:23.951
You know, if I could say,
I would.

37:25.202 --> 37:27.455
What'd you tell him?

37:27.538 --> 37:29.290
Don't threaten me, David.

37:29.373 --> 37:30.875
I-I'm not threatening you.

37:30.958 --> 37:32.835
If this continues,
I'm going to call the police.

37:32.919 --> 37:34.712
What in God's name
is going on?

37:34.795 --> 37:38.299
Oh! David,
you're hurting me.

37:38.382 --> 37:40.927
Please just leave me alone.

38:40.653 --> 38:43.906
What about-what about
fives? Do you have any fives?

38:43.990 --> 38:46.951
Go fish!

38:47.034 --> 38:49.036
Mommy, do you wanna play?

38:49.120 --> 38:51.080
Aunt Carrie?

38:51.163 --> 38:52.623
Okay...

39:00.381 --> 39:03.467
So...

39:03.551 --> 39:05.594
you miss me, huh?

39:05.678 --> 39:07.263
I do. You busy?

39:07.346 --> 39:10.516
- Very.
<i>- Really?</i>

39:10.599 --> 39:12.768
<i>No.</i>

39:12.852 --> 39:15.271
I think we should get
everybody together tonight.

39:15.354 --> 39:18.941
You, me, Dante, the boys,
have a few drinks.

39:19.025 --> 39:21.986
Celebrate
a well-executed mission.

39:24.697 --> 39:27.658
Got Chinese.

39:27.742 --> 39:29.785
Remember this day.
The National Security Advisor

39:29.869 --> 39:32.788
- just brought you dinner.
- You look at those names

39:32.872 --> 39:34.915
I sent over--
Dante Allen, Simone Martin?

39:34.999 --> 39:38.544
Uh, yeah, you should have
a look at this.

39:38.627 --> 39:41.338
I mean, it helps
that this guy Wellington

39:41.422 --> 39:44.467
is like a walking meme.

39:44.550 --> 39:48.220
- When was this taken?
- About an hour ago.

39:49.722 --> 39:51.057
How does it get
from tapas bar spat

39:51.140 --> 39:53.684
to national network news
in an hour?

39:53.768 --> 39:57.354
Well, that's the end of
the journey. The species jump.

39:57.438 --> 40:01.317
Really, we should start here.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.568
What's that?

40:02.651 --> 40:06.822
Well, that's a node.
Uh, an identity.

40:06.906 --> 40:10.284
- What's it do?
- Well, that's the tweet
with the frame grab

40:10.367 --> 40:12.870
and the caption. I mean,
that's-that's the meme.

40:15.122 --> 40:17.041
All right, so these are
the nodes that respond.

40:17.124 --> 40:19.043
They're actually mostly
automated accounts.

40:19.126 --> 40:21.170
They light up red
when they retweet messages,

40:21.253 --> 40:26.092
which they do sporadically over
time so that it looks natural.

40:26.175 --> 40:27.760
- What about the green ones?
- Yeah, no, those are...

40:27.843 --> 40:29.678
those are real people,
those are verified accounts.

40:29.762 --> 40:33.599
So, like, like, a real person
might send a meme to a friend

40:33.682 --> 40:36.393
or two or ten or maybe
everyone they know.

40:36.477 --> 40:38.020
In epidemiology, that's called

40:38.104 --> 40:40.689
a replication rate,
and every meme has one.

40:40.773 --> 40:43.109
- So that's the real people
passing it on.
- Mm-hmm.

40:43.192 --> 40:46.070
Each green node represents
a thousand people.

40:46.153 --> 40:49.490
Okay. So, that--
that's what it looks like

40:49.573 --> 40:51.492
on a national scale.

41:01.127 --> 41:03.629
- You seeing this?
- Yep.

41:03.712 --> 41:05.548
Okay, now look here.

41:07.508 --> 41:09.051
That's what happened
at Lucasville.

41:09.135 --> 41:11.053
I had to fiddle with the time
a little bit

41:11.137 --> 41:13.389
- to make things obvious.
- Way more green nodes.

41:13.472 --> 41:15.891
Twice as many.
I mean, this is a bigger story.

41:15.975 --> 41:17.726
It's a better meme.
But-but it's the red nodes

41:17.810 --> 41:21.438
that really caught my eye.
The-the automated accounts.

41:21.522 --> 41:25.067
So, so far, yeah,
I've identified over

41:25.151 --> 41:26.986
75 of them now also
retweeting remarks

41:27.069 --> 41:29.238
by the president's
chief of staff.

41:32.575 --> 41:35.119
Same accounts for both stories.

41:37.288 --> 41:39.498
- Is that unusual?
- Well, no, not if the memes

41:39.582 --> 41:41.584
are being pushed
by the same network.

41:43.627 --> 41:44.795
You mean Yevgeny.

41:44.879 --> 41:47.256
Yeah. I mean,
if he was behind Lucasville,

41:47.339 --> 41:49.258
I-I'd say he's got a hand
in this one, too.

41:57.516 --> 41:59.894
- Something wrong?
- Heads up from Langley.

41:59.977 --> 42:02.688
Apparently, someone's been
trying to reach me on Zipline.

42:02.771 --> 42:06.942
Zipline? What is that? Is that
like a-that's a spy thing?

42:07.026 --> 42:09.612
For compromised agents
to send out a distress call.

42:09.695 --> 42:14.033
Not anymore. Shut it down
after Allison Carr defected.

42:14.116 --> 42:16.994
Well, that's odd, then.
Who could it be?

42:17.077 --> 42:18.579
No idea.

42:18.662 --> 42:22.333
Used an old work name.
No record of it.

42:22.416 --> 42:24.710
Says it's urgent.

42:24.793 --> 42:27.171
Wants a meeting tonight.

42:28.380 --> 42:31.050
Remember anybody calling
himself John Bishop?

42:31.133 --> 42:33.636
- That's how he signed off?
- Yeah.

42:33.719 --> 42:36.388
It's Ivan, Saul.

42:36.472 --> 42:39.225
Ivan's hiking in the Tetons.
I was just on the phone

42:39.308 --> 42:41.101
this morning
with the FBI field office.

42:41.185 --> 42:44.563
They're mistaken. "Bishop"
was Ivan's word code in Berlin.

42:44.647 --> 42:48.317
With the counterintelligence
boys, anyway.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.903
- Why Bishop?
- Because of the Orthodox cross

42:50.986 --> 42:53.322
he always wore
around his neck.

44:24.955 --> 44:26.957
All right, okay.
Here, catch.

44:27.041 --> 44:29.918
Everybody get a lime.
You get a lime.

44:30.002 --> 44:32.379
- What? I don't get a lime?
- For your soda?

44:32.463 --> 44:33.630
No, you can have mine
when I'm finished.

44:33.714 --> 44:35.424
That's great.
I'm excited about that.

44:35.507 --> 44:37.468
- No salt?
- How old are you?

44:37.551 --> 44:39.553
- You want some goldfish
crackers, too?
- How are you giving me shit

44:39.636 --> 44:41.430
about the salt
when you got the limes?

44:41.513 --> 44:43.474
All right, I wanna make a toast.

44:43.557 --> 44:45.476
Dante Allen,
ladies and gentlemen.

44:47.227 --> 44:50.064
There you go.
Take this. Hold this.

44:50.147 --> 44:52.024
- I'm gonna say
something profound now.
- What are we drinking?

44:52.107 --> 44:53.650
- It's a cheap tequila.
- No, no, it's on her tab.

44:53.734 --> 44:55.736
I got the good stuff. I mean,
you wouldn't want to sip it

44:55.819 --> 44:58.822
- with a cigar, but...
- You can't even spend
somebody else's money right.

44:58.906 --> 45:00.074
Shut your mouth.
Here's my toast.

45:00.157 --> 45:01.992
She doesn't have a drink.
Mathison.

45:02.076 --> 45:03.535
- No, I'm good. I got my seltzer.
- She's not drinking.

45:03.619 --> 45:07.164
- Since when? You pregnant?
- For fuck's sake.

45:07.247 --> 45:09.500
Stein, I'm on drugs.
I can't mix it with alcohol.

45:09.583 --> 45:12.002
Okay, can I please make
my motherfucking toast?

45:12.086 --> 45:14.630
No, you missed the moment.
Down the fucking hatch.

45:14.713 --> 45:16.298
Let's go.

45:16.382 --> 45:17.674
- There you go.
- Oh.

45:19.301 --> 45:21.136
- Ah!
- Oh!

45:21.220 --> 45:22.971
- Whoo.
- Oh.

45:23.055 --> 45:25.265
- Not bad, right?
- Not good either, bro.

45:25.349 --> 45:28.227
I'm getting the next round.
I am getting the next round.

45:28.310 --> 45:31.063
What, you think you got taste?
You're no better than he is.

45:31.146 --> 45:32.689
What is this music?
Is this you, Max?

45:32.773 --> 45:34.316
- Did you put this on?
- Yep.

45:34.400 --> 45:38.278
This is an '80s classic.
This is my kind of music, man.

45:38.362 --> 45:41.615
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:41.698 --> 45:43.367
I tried to call you.

45:43.450 --> 45:47.496
Yeah, I was...
I was probably asleep.

45:47.579 --> 45:48.747
That's okay.

45:48.831 --> 45:50.958
No, it isn't.
It's embarrassing.

45:51.041 --> 45:54.753
I think I've been so wound up
these past few days, I...

45:54.837 --> 45:56.588
I forgot to take my meds.
I'm going to

45:56.672 --> 45:58.674
the doctor tomorrow.
I think you're right.

45:58.757 --> 46:01.510
I should have a more
traditional protocol.

46:01.593 --> 46:05.889
- That's good.
- Yeah. Yeah. I'm being good.

46:05.973 --> 46:07.349
I'm glad.

46:07.433 --> 46:10.602
It's a big day. Simone's gonna
give up Wellington.

46:10.686 --> 46:14.523
- Yeah, it's incredible.
- Mm. So...

46:14.606 --> 46:16.442
Where'd you get the idea she was
working with someone else?

46:16.525 --> 46:20.362
Oh. Who knows? Crazy shit just
pops into my head sometimes.

46:20.446 --> 46:24.575
I... I guess...
I guess I was still obsessing

46:24.658 --> 46:26.452
about those two bugs
crapping out in the op.

46:26.535 --> 46:28.954
I'm-I'm... I'm sorry.

46:29.037 --> 46:31.039
No need to apologize.

46:31.123 --> 46:34.084
How about a thank you, then?

46:34.168 --> 46:36.253
Sure.

46:38.881 --> 46:40.549
You saved me.

46:48.932 --> 46:51.185
Hey. What's wrong?

46:53.937 --> 46:55.230
Nothing. It's just, I...

46:58.150 --> 47:00.944
I don't wanna be like that
with you. I wanna be normal.

47:01.028 --> 47:02.446
I actually like you.

47:02.529 --> 47:06.325
I mean, not...
not like that, but...

47:06.408 --> 47:08.494
Oh, no? Okay.

47:08.577 --> 47:11.246
I don't know.

47:11.330 --> 47:13.415
I guess I hadn't thought
about it.

47:13.499 --> 47:17.211
You hadn't thought about it.

47:18.670 --> 47:21.089
- That's even worse.
- All right, that's not true.

47:21.173 --> 47:24.760
It's possible I have
thought about it.

47:26.303 --> 47:28.263
Shirley Temple for the baby.

47:28.347 --> 47:31.517
- Thank you.
- Here we go. Okay.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.977
<i>Kanpai</i>. Toast.

47:37.272 --> 47:38.941
Oh.

47:39.024 --> 47:40.734
- Fuck, yeah.
- Yeah.

47:40.817 --> 47:42.402
Oh.

47:42.486 --> 47:44.988
- Better, huh?
- It's exactly the same.

47:45.072 --> 47:47.366
You're a fucking plebe.
That taste the same to you?

47:47.449 --> 47:48.992
Yeah, man, it tastes
exactly the same.

47:49.076 --> 47:51.703
- Oh!
- He's got some balls on him.

47:51.787 --> 47:54.373
I wouldn't challenge Doxie
on this one.

47:54.456 --> 47:56.458
They both taste like shit.
I don't know what to tell you.

47:56.542 --> 47:58.335
Oh!

47:58.418 --> 48:01.255
Oh, he's new, he's new.
You gotta cut him some slack.

48:01.338 --> 48:04.383
- No, actually, I don't.
- Stand down, baby. Stand down.

48:04.466 --> 48:08.470
I do not... You should just
let it go. Apologize.

48:08.554 --> 48:12.891
Here, have a potato chip.
It's all gonna be...

52:10.796 --> 52:12.506
Come here.

52:49.334 --> 52:53.755
- You okay?
- Shit. Uh...

52:53.839 --> 52:56.508
Yeah, just, uh...

52:56.591 --> 53:00.929
Just too much to drink.

53:02.597 --> 53:04.266
- Okay.
- Okay.

53:04.349 --> 53:06.059
I'm good.

53:14.693 --> 53:18.488
Oh. Mm.

53:21.116 --> 53:24.578
You're okay.

53:24.661 --> 53:28.290
Just close your eyes.

54:14.628 --> 54:16.212
Anson.
