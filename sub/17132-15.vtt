WEBVTT

00:03.471 --> 00:05.739
GEORGE, LOOK AT US.
WE'RE THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH,

00:05.739 --> 00:08.442
AND YOU'VE GOT US
DRESSED LIKE CRIMINALS.

00:08.442 --> 00:11.045
THE SAFETY VIDEO SAID
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WEAR

00:11.045 --> 00:13.047
OUR REFLECTOR VESTS.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.848
ANGIE, WE HAVE
THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.

00:14.848 --> 00:18.886
97% OF ALL ARRESTS ARE MADE
BY UNDERCOVER COPS.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.289
OKAY, THE VEST
WAS TOO SMALL.

00:21.289 --> 00:24.024
MY HEAD DIDN'T FIT
THROUGH THE NECK HOLE.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.794
WE CAN'T MAKE ARRESTS ANYWAY.
WE'RE NOT EVEN ARMED.

00:26.794 --> 00:30.331
I DON'T NEED TO BE ARMED.
MY BODY IS MY WEAPON. WHAT-TCHA.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.700
I DON'T WANNA HEAR

00:32.700 --> 00:35.869
ABOUT YOUR TWO WEEKS
OF JUDO AT THE "Y" AGAIN.

00:35.869 --> 00:40.007
YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING? GRAB MY SHIRT.

00:40.007 --> 00:42.910
I'M NOT GONNA
GRAB YOUR SHIRT.

00:42.910 --> 00:46.947
GO AHEAD, GRAB IT.
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF, PUNK?

00:46.947 --> 00:48.616
FINE.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.919
NOT AT THE BOTTOM.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.921
WHO GRABS A SHIRT
AT THE BOTTOM?

00:53.921 --> 00:55.923
GRAB IT LIKE
YOU WANNA KILL ME.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.758
THAT I CAN DO.

00:57.758 --> 01:01.028
YOU'RE STILL NOT GETTING IT.
HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU.

01:01.028 --> 01:03.197
VÃ¡MANOS! Â¿POR QUÃ©?
Â¿SABES QUÃ©?

01:04.932 --> 01:07.635
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK,
OFFICER.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.270
I'M JUST
TEACHING HER A LESSON.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.639
(both laugh nervously)

01:11.639 --> 01:14.041
PUT YOUR HANDS
IN THE AIR.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.543
(sighs)

01:15.543 --> 01:18.779
NOW WAVE THEM
LIKE YOU JUST DON'T CARE.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.485
SANCHEZ?

01:24.485 --> 01:26.987
(laughs) I'M JUST HAVING FUN
WITH YOU, GEORGE.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.489
WHAT'S UP?

01:28.489 --> 01:29.990
WHAT'S UP, WHAT'S UP?

01:29.990 --> 01:31.759
HEY, ANGIE.
HI.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.462
LAST NIGHT I MADE
A HOMELESS GUY DO THE ROBOT.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.730
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING OUT HERE?

01:36.730 --> 01:38.566
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH PATROL.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.834
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE DRESSED IN DARK CLOTHES.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.636
DIDN'T YOU SEE THE VIDEO?

01:42.636 --> 01:45.339
I TRIED TO TELL HER,
BUT YOU KNOW WOMEN.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.408
BLACK IS SLIMMING.

01:47.408 --> 01:50.511
SOMEDAY YOUR VANITY
IS GONNA GET US BOTH KILLED.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.045
NEXT TIME WEAR THE VESTS.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.047
ONE OF YOUR NEIGHBORS CALLED,
SAYING THERE WAS SOME

01:54.047 --> 01:56.684
SUSPICIOUS LOOKING PEOPLE
WALKING AROUND IN HOODIES.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.386
WHY WOULD SOMEONE
REPORT US?

01:58.386 --> 02:00.554
EVERYONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
KNOWS WHO WE ARE.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.191
IT'S MR. SORKIN, THE NEW GUY
WHO JUST MOVED IN OVER THERE.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.825
(man) All units,
we have a 647--

02:04.825 --> 02:08.128
a naked woman on foot
chasing a truck

02:08.128 --> 02:10.831
at the corner
of Riverside and Pass.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.200
ANGIE, WHERE'S MY MOM?

02:12.200 --> 02:16.370
I JUST TALKED TO HER.
SHE'S AT THE HOUSE.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.372
YOU'RE LUCKY IT'S NOT
MY MOM NAKED.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.641
YOU SEE A LOT
OF NASTY STUFF OUT HERE,

02:20.641 --> 02:22.776
BUT THERE'S NO TRAINING
FOR THAT.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.712
ALL RIGHT, MAN, I GOTTA GO.
SEE YOU LATER.

02:24.712 --> 02:28.416
(woman) 7025, code 6.
105 North/Avenue 52.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.618
(radio static)

02:30.618 --> 02:31.919
(engine starts)

02:31.919 --> 02:33.287
(siren whoops)

02:33.287 --> 02:35.823
OH, THERE'S MR. SORKIN.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.592
WE SHOULD GO OVER THERE
AND INTRODUCE OURSELVES.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.494
OH, ANGIE, I HATE
MEETING NEW PEOPLE.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.730
I DIDN'T WANNA MEET OUR KIDS
AFTER THEY WERE BORN.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.832
YOU CRIED
WHEN THEY WERE BORN.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.535
BECAUSE I WASTED
THREE SUNDAYS ON LAMAZE,

02:47.535 --> 02:50.604
AND THEY STILL
SHOT YOU UP LIKE A JUNKIE. OW!

02:55.976 --> 02:57.711
CAN I HELP YOU?

02:57.711 --> 03:01.515
HI, I'M ANGIE LOPEZ,
AND THIS IS MY HUSBAND GEORGE.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.651
WE'RE THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH
CAPTAINS.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.487
OH, THANK GOD. CHESTER SORKIN.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.489
I SAW YOU TWO
IN THOSE SWEATSHIRTS

03:08.489 --> 03:10.591
AND THE DARK CLOTHES,

03:10.591 --> 03:13.427
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE CASING HOUSES.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.962
(laughs)
CASING HOUSES?

03:14.962 --> 03:18.799
NOT TONIGHT.
WE'RE JUST STRIPPING CARS.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.334
WHAT YEAR IS THIS, 2004?

03:20.334 --> 03:22.736
GEORGE, STOP IT.
HE DOESN'T KNOW YOU.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.639
MY HUSBAND WANTED US
TO GO UNDERCOVER.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.641
OH, I'M GLAD
YOU TOLD ME THAT.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.677
I COULDA DONE
SOMETHING STUPID,

03:29.677 --> 03:31.879
MISTAKING YOU PEOPLE
FOR THE--THE BAD ONES.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.615
SEE YOU AROUND.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.350
DID YOU HEAR THAT,
ANGIE?

03:36.350 --> 03:38.986
"YOU PEOPLE,
THE BAD ONES"?

03:38.986 --> 03:40.788
GEORGE, DON'T OVERREACT.

03:40.788 --> 03:43.991
OVERREACT? HE SAW TWO LATINO
PEOPLE WALKING DOWN THE STREET,

03:43.991 --> 03:45.493
AND HE CALLED THE COPS.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.428
RACIST! Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
I HATE HIM.

03:47.428 --> 03:50.163
YOU'RE READING
TOO MUCH INTO THIS.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.600
AM I? LET'S GET
ANOTHER OPINION.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.837
WHY DON'T WE WAKE UP THE STATUE
OF THE SLEEPING MEXICAN

03:56.837 --> 03:59.607
AND ASK HIM?

03:59.607 --> 04:02.310
OKAY, THAT'S
A LITTLE OFFENSIVE.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.111
"NOT A RACIST."
I TOLD YOU.

04:04.111 --> 04:07.881
HEY, YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE MARRIED
TO "ONE OF THE SMART ONES."

04:07.881 --> 04:09.550
OKAY, I KNOW YOU'RE MAD.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.752
LET'S JUST GO HOME,
AND WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.987
ANGIE, I AM NOT
PUTTING UP WITH THIS,

04:13.987 --> 04:16.990
AND MY MOM'S GONNA BE MAD, TOO.
THAT THING LOOKS JUST LIKE HER.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.860
HOW CAN YOU TELL?
IT'S GOT A SOMBRERO ON.

04:19.860 --> 04:23.297
NOT THE SLEEPING MEXICAN,
THE GARDEN GNOME.
OH.

04:23.297 --> 04:26.400
YOU PUT MY MOM IN A POINTY HAT,
LET HER BEARD GROW,

04:26.400 --> 04:28.569
THEY COULD BE TWINS.

04:28.569 --> 04:31.705
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

04:35.175 --> 04:37.044
* ALL MY FRIENDS

04:37.044 --> 04:40.614
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

04:42.215 --> 04:43.984
* THE LOW RIDER

04:43.984 --> 04:47.287
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

04:47.287 --> 04:50.791
**

04:59.933 --> 05:02.503
SORKIN JUST GOT HOME. YOU SHOULD
SEE HOW DIRTY HIS CAR IS.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.505
HE PROBABLY DRIVES
ALL THE WAY TO UTAH

05:04.505 --> 05:06.507
SO WHITE PEOPLE
CAN WASH IT.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.942
WELL, I'M NOT
HAVING ANY LUCK HERE.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.745
I'VE LOOKED THROUGH EVERY CITY
ORDINANCE THEY'VE EVER PASSED,

05:11.745 --> 05:13.747
AND THERE IS NOTHING
ABOUT KEEPING

05:13.747 --> 05:16.249
A RACIALLY INSENSITIVE STATUE
ON YOUR LAWN,

05:16.249 --> 05:20.087
ALTHOUGH WE CAN STILL KEEP
CHICKENS IN OUR CARRIAGE HOUSE.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.322
(knock on door)

05:24.057 --> 05:26.927
GEORGE, I'M READY, MAN.
LET'S GO DO THIS.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.532
DO WHAT?

05:31.532 --> 05:33.501
LISTEN, YOU KEEP LOOKING
ON THE COMPUTER.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.002
WE'RE GONNA GO OVER

05:35.002 --> 05:37.705
AND ASK HIM VERY NICELY
TO TAKE THE STATUE DOWN.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.039
WHY ARE YOU
TAKING ERNIE WITH YOU?

05:39.039 --> 05:41.341
BECAUSE, UH,
HE'S VERY ARTICULATE.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.277
HEY, HE WAS ON THE DEBATE TEAM
IN HIGH SCHOOL, REMEMBER?

05:44.277 --> 05:45.779
HE WAS THE TIMEKEEPER.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.348
YEAH, BUT HE WAS
VERY GOOD AT IT. ERNIE?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.117
TIME.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.187
GEORGE, YOU'RE GOING OVER THERE
TO THREATEN SORKIN,

05:54.187 --> 05:55.423
AND ERNIE IS YOUR BACKUP?

05:55.423 --> 05:57.057
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO,

05:57.057 --> 06:00.494
STAND THERE AND SCREAM LIKE
A GIRL WHILE YOU GET HIT?

06:00.494 --> 06:04.097
IF THAT'S
WHAT IT TAKES, EH.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.734
LOOK, ANGIE, GUYS LIKE THIS
DON'T CARE ABOUT ORDINANCES.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.101
YOU SAW THE STATUE.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.838
HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE
A NEON SIGN ON HIS LAWN

06:10.838 --> 06:13.607
THAT SAYS "ALL MEXICANS
ARE LAZY AND DUMB."

06:13.607 --> 06:16.109
DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS
I'M IN SPECIAL ED?

06:16.109 --> 06:19.980
MAX, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BEING MEXICAN.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.483
THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR MOM
READ TO YOU EVERY NIGHT,

06:22.483 --> 06:25.285
AND NOW BOOKS
MAKE YOU SLEEPY.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.254
(Angie) GEORGE... JUST STOP.

06:27.254 --> 06:30.458
YOU CAN'T GO OVER THERE
AND GET IN THIS GUY'S FACE.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.926
WHAT IF HE'S CRAZY?
WHAT IF HE HAS A GUN?

06:32.926 --> 06:35.929
SHE'S RIGHT.
THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOME LUMBER.

06:35.929 --> 06:39.833
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL THIS
IN THE HANDS OF A JUDO MASTER?

06:39.833 --> 06:42.503
"THE LAST THING HE TOUCHES
BEFORE HE DIES"?

06:42.503 --> 06:44.505
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

06:44.505 --> 06:47.274
A RACIST JUST MOVED IN
DOWN THE BLOCK.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.009
HE'S A WHITE GUY

06:49.009 --> 06:52.012
THAT HAS A STATUE OF
A SLEEPING MEXICAN ON HIS LAWN.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.783
THAT IS JUST LIKE
WHITE PEOPLE--

06:55.783 --> 06:57.751
YOU KNOW,
TO TAKE THE WHOLE GROUP

06:57.751 --> 06:59.620
AND SAY
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.891
COME ON, ERNIE.
I AM NOT LETTING YOU OUT
OF THIS HOUSE WITH THAT BAT.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.026
YEAH?
HOW YOU GONNA STOP ME?

07:07.695 --> 07:10.698
OKAY, I DARE YOU TO GIVE IT
BACK TO ME AND TRY IT AGAIN.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.232
I WASN'T READY.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.535
YOU'RE JUST
GONNA GET HURT.

07:14.535 --> 07:17.771
YOU'VE GOT THE REFLEXES
OF A DRUNK GRANDMA.

07:20.908 --> 07:24.077
YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY
ABOUT DRUNK GRANDMAS?

07:26.246 --> 07:28.181
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.655
ANGIE, IF YOU DON'T DEAL WITH
THIS KIND OF STUFF RIGHT AWAY,

07:34.655 --> 07:37.424
IT SPREADS.
I THINK DAD'S RIGHT.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.627
THERE'S EVEN RACISM
IN MY SCHOOL.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.729
I'M PRETTY SURE
I'M GETTING A "D" IN MATH

07:41.729 --> 07:43.664
BECAUSE MY TEACHER
HATES LATINOS.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.967
MAX, 50% OF YOUR CLASS
IS LATINO.

07:46.967 --> 07:52.039
NO WAY. THERE ARE, LIKE,
30 KIDS, AND ONLY 15 ARE LATINO.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.473
OH...

07:55.042 --> 07:57.945
YOU'RE NOT HELPING
THE CAUSE!

07:57.945 --> 08:00.548
NOW I WANT YOU
TO GO UP TO YOUR ROOM

08:00.548 --> 08:04.952
AND DON'T COME BACK DOWN
FOR 50% OF AN HOUR.

08:04.952 --> 08:08.188
YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO
UP THERE AND GET HIM, RIGHT?

08:08.188 --> 08:09.456
YEAH.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.458
LOOK, I AM GOING
TO WRITE MR. SORKIN

08:11.458 --> 08:12.960
A STRONGLY WORDED LETTER

08:12.960 --> 08:14.895
OUTLINING WHY WE THINK
HIS STATUE IS OFFENSIVE,

08:14.895 --> 08:18.198
AND ASK HIM TO RESPECT
OUR FEELINGS AND REMOVE IT.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.801
AND...

08:20.801 --> 08:22.570
I AM GOING TO PUT IT

08:22.570 --> 08:25.505
DIRECTLY INTO HIS MAILBOX.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.041
I BET IF THAT WAS
A STATUE OF A CUBAN

08:28.041 --> 08:30.678
WASTING EVERYBODY'S TIME
BY WRITING A DUMB LETTER,

08:30.678 --> 08:32.279
YOU'D THINK
IT WAS OFFENSIVE.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.115
THE PEN IS MIGHTIER
THAN THE SWORD.

08:35.115 --> 08:39.119
YEAH? THAT'S WHY IN "SCARFACE"
AT THE END OF THE MOVIE,

08:39.119 --> 08:40.621
HE WALKS IN AND SAYS...

08:40.621 --> 08:45.092
(imitates Al Pacino)
"SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE PEN."

08:48.896 --> 08:51.665
GEORGE, I JUST
FINISHED THE LETTER,

08:51.665 --> 08:54.334
AND I PUT IT
ON OFFICIAL STATIONERY--

08:54.334 --> 08:56.604
"N.W.A."

08:56.604 --> 09:00.574
ICE CUBE AND DR. DRE'S
OLD GROUP?

09:00.574 --> 09:03.210
YOU'RE SENDING THIS
TO A RACIST?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.946
NOT THAT N.W.A.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.215
"THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH
ASSOCIATION."

09:08.215 --> 09:09.717
OKAY, ANGIE, BUT LOOK,

09:09.717 --> 09:10.951
I THINK THE LETTER
SHOULD SCARE HIM A LITTLE.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.986
I WOULD WHITE OUT
THE LITTLE CRIME DOG

09:12.986 --> 09:15.088
AND SIGN IT "WU-TANG CLAN."

09:16.123 --> 09:17.925
(knock on door)

09:21.061 --> 09:23.296
OH, SORKIN.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

09:23.296 --> 09:26.867
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.369
(chuckles)
IT'S CALLED A SOMBRERO.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.805
ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW
IS ON TELEMUNDO.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.941
THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY.
HAVE UN BUENO DÃ­A.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.710
YEAH, YEAH.
HOLD UP, HOLD UP.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.979
SOMEBODY SMASHED
MY STATUE LAST NIGHT,

09:38.979 --> 09:40.981
AND I THINK I KNOW
WHO IT WAS.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.183
WELL, IT WASN'T A MEXICAN,
'CAUSE WE WERE UP ALL NIGHT

09:43.183 --> 09:44.885
DRINKING TEQUILA,
AND AFTER THE COCKFIGHT,

09:44.885 --> 09:47.387
WE ALL FELL ASLEEP IN THE YARD
UNDER OUR HATS.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.355
GOOD-BYE.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.365
LOOK, MAN, I DIDN'T DO IT.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.701
OH, COME ON. YOU WERE
AT MY HOUSE LAST NIGHT.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.602
I KNOW YOU SAW IT.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.305
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
MAYBE THE STATUE WOKE UP,

10:05.305 --> 10:07.941
REALIZED IT WAS
A RACIST LAWN ORNAMENT

10:07.941 --> 10:09.677
AND SMASHED ITSELF.

10:09.677 --> 10:13.046
EVERYONE...
EVERYONE CALM DOWN.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.215
IT'S NOT RACIST.
IT'S A PIECE OF ART.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.351
I PAID 50 BUCKS FOR THAT,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:18.351 --> 10:20.988
IT WAS MADE
BY MEXICANS IN MEXICO.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.290
DUDE, IT'S NOT 1950, OKAY?

10:23.290 --> 10:25.625
YOU LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD
THAT'S HALF MEXICAN-AMERICAN.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.761
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
IF I HAD A STATUE

10:27.761 --> 10:29.562
OF A WHITE GUY
ON MY LAWN,

10:29.562 --> 10:31.965
ACCUSING PEOPLE OF CRIMES
THEY DIDN'T COMMIT?

10:31.965 --> 10:34.467
HE'D BE LIKE THAT.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.004
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:37.004 --> 10:39.306
I DON'T CARE WHETHER
YOU LIKE MY STATUE OR NOT.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.508
YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT
TO SMASH IT,

10:41.508 --> 10:43.310
AND THAT'S WHAT
I TOLD THE COPS.

10:43.310 --> 10:47.614
HEY, I DIDN'T SMASH IT.
YES, YOU DID. YOU!

10:47.614 --> 10:49.783
THAT'S THE POINT!
TAKE A PICTURE.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.418
WE'LL SEND IT DOWN TO MEXICO.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.054
WE'LL GET 'EM
MAKING STATUES LIKE THAT.

10:54.054 --> 10:58.458
MR. SORKIN, MY HUSBAND AND I ARE
BOTH HARDWORKING, HONEST PEOPLE

10:58.458 --> 11:01.795
WHO WOULD NEVER, EVER DESTROY
SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPERTY.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.630
WE DON'T BELIEVE IN VIOLENCE,

11:03.630 --> 11:07.968
AND WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE
FROM THE POLICE. GOOD DAY.

11:09.469 --> 11:13.841
YOU IDIOT! NOW WE HAVE TO HIDE
FROM THE POLICE.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.643
ANGIE, I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T DO IT.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.511
WHY WOULD I LIE TO YOU?
I DON'T KNOW.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.614
WHY DID MY NECK TURN GREEN
FROM THAT GOLD NECKLACE

11:21.614 --> 11:24.051
YOU BOUGHT ME?
IT'S PERUVIAN GOLD.

11:24.051 --> 11:27.687
IN PERU, A GREEN NECK
IS A SIGN OF ROYALTY.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.590
(speaks indistinctly)

11:30.590 --> 11:32.592
GEORGE, JUST STOP LYING.

11:32.592 --> 11:34.728
I KNOW
YOU BROKE THE STATUE.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.596
OH, HE DIDN'T BREAK IT.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.465
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

11:38.465 --> 11:40.233
'CAUSE I DID.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.035
YOU SEE?

11:42.035 --> 11:44.571
YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO GET
A PICTURE OF YOURSELF

11:44.571 --> 11:47.407
WITH THAT GARDEN GNOME,
DID YOU?

11:47.407 --> 11:50.811
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
YOU'RE ON PROBATION!

11:50.811 --> 11:53.713
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE TAKEN CRAP

11:53.713 --> 11:55.883
FROM PEOPLE LIKE THAT
MY WHOLE LIFE.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.418
THEY THINK MEXICANS
ARE ALL LAZY

11:58.418 --> 12:00.120
OR--OR THEY'RE CRIMINALS.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.190
IN EIGHTH GRADE, MY TEACHER
HAD HER WALLET STOLEN,

12:03.190 --> 12:05.592
AND MY LOCKER WAS
THE FIRST ONE THEY SEARCHED.

12:05.592 --> 12:09.362
PLEASE TELL ME
THEY DIDN'T FIND IT IN THERE.

12:09.362 --> 12:12.432
HELL, NO. ALL THEY FOUND
WAS A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH,

12:12.432 --> 12:17.337
WHICH I PAID FOR MYSELF
WITH MY BABYSITTING MONEY.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.506
WHAT IF SOMEONE SAW YOU?

12:19.506 --> 12:20.607
NOBODY SAW ME.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.409
YOU'RE THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH,

12:22.409 --> 12:27.014
AND I HAD TO TELL YOU
THAT I DID IT.

12:27.014 --> 12:30.450
DO I WANT TO HEAR THIS,
OR SHOULD I LEAVE NOW

12:30.450 --> 12:33.620
SO I CAN PASS
THE LIE DETECTOR TEST LATER?

12:33.620 --> 12:36.056
NO, YOU CAN STAY.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.557
IF IT HAS "TEST"
IN THE NAME,

12:37.557 --> 12:41.528
YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT
GONNA PASS IT ANYWAY.

12:41.528 --> 12:45.432
MAX, YOUR GRANDMOTHER
DID SOMETHING VERY WRONG.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.501
SHE WENT ACROSS THE STREET
AND BROKE MR. SORKIN'S STATUE.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.370
WELL, HOLD ON, ANGIE.
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.373
YES, IT IS.
SHE BROKE THE LAW.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.844
MAX, YOUR GRANDMA STOOD UP
FOR SOMETHING SHE BELIEVED IN.

12:56.844 --> 12:59.179
WAS IT A CRIME FOR ROSA PARKS

12:59.179 --> 13:01.214
TO SIT WHERE SHE WANTED
ON THE BUS?

13:01.214 --> 13:04.317
WAS IT A CRIME FOR CESAR CHAVEZ
TO PROTEST IN THE FIELDS?

13:04.317 --> 13:06.653
WAS IT A CRIME
FOR PRESIDENT NIXON

13:06.653 --> 13:10.590
TO SNEAK IN A HOTEL
AND WATCH DEEP THROAT?
(Angie) GEORGE!

13:10.590 --> 13:13.393
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

13:13.393 --> 13:17.430
I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS NIXON
AT THE WATERCREST MOTEL.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.666
GEORGE, YOU'RE MAKING
THIS ALL SOUND

13:19.666 --> 13:21.668
LIKE YOUR MOM
DID A GOOD THING.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.603
IT WAS VANDALISM.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.405
(George) NO, IT WASN'T.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.408
ANGIE, LOOK, I'VE SEEN MY MOM
SMASH A LOT OF THINGS--

13:28.408 --> 13:32.379
PIGGY BANKS, CAR WINDOWS,
MY HOPES AND DREAMS.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.381
BUT THIS TIME,
IT WAS FOR JUSTICE.

13:34.381 --> 13:37.517
MOM...
I'VE NEVER SAID THIS BEFORE.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.818
BUT I'M PROUD OF YOU.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.554
VIVA LA RAZA!

13:41.554 --> 13:45.725
WEREN'T YOU AFRAID
YOU'D GET BUSTED, GRANDMA?
HELL, NO.

13:45.725 --> 13:48.261
BECAUSE SHE WAS TAKING CARE
OF BUSINESS, MAX.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.098
NOW SORKIN KNOWS
WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT,

13:51.098 --> 13:53.166
AND HE'S NEVER
GONNA MESS WITH US AGAIN.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.534
WHO'S MESSING WITH YOU?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.904
A GUY DOWN THE STREET
PUT UP A RACIST STATUE,

13:56.904 --> 13:59.539
AND GRANDMA TOOK IT OUT.

13:59.539 --> 14:03.476
IT WASN'T A MEXICAN SLEEPING
IN A SOMBRERO, WAS IT?
YEAH, WHY? YOU SAW IT?

14:03.476 --> 14:07.314
JUST A MINUTE AGO. HE'S PUTTING
TWO OF THEM UP NOW--

14:07.314 --> 14:10.150
ONE ON EITHER SIDE
OF THE BURRO.

14:10.150 --> 14:15.755
WELL, NOW
THERE'S A BURRO.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.991
ONE MORE NIGHTTIME RAID,

14:17.991 --> 14:20.327
AND I BET WE'D GET
THE BANDIDO.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.362
THIS JUST PROVES
HE'S A RACIST,

14:22.362 --> 14:25.332
AND HE NEEDS
TO LEARN ANOTHER LESSON.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.167
NO. BENNY ALREADY
GOT LUCKY ONCE,

14:27.167 --> 14:30.570
AND IF YOU GO, I SWEAR
BY ALL THAT IS HOLY,

14:30.570 --> 14:34.374
WE WILL HAVE A FIGHT
THAT WILL MAKE EVERY FIGHT

14:34.374 --> 14:38.912
WE'VE EVER HAD SEEM LIKE
A LITTLE CHAT OVER TEA.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.884
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.686
I SAY WHEN SHE GOES TO SLEEP,

14:46.686 --> 14:49.422
WE GRAB A COUPLE OF BASEBALL
BATS AND HEAD OVER THERE.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.325
THIS GUY IS NOT GONNA WIN.
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.827
LOOK, I APPRECIATE IT, VIC,
BUT THIS ISN'T YOUR FIGHT.

14:54.827 --> 14:58.165
OH, I UNDERSTAND. JUST KNOW
THAT I SHARE YOUR PAIN.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.533
THE CUBAN PEOPLE
AND THE MEXICAN PEOPLE

15:00.533 --> 15:03.403
HAVE ALWAYS STOOD
SIDE BY SIDE.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.739
WHEN?

15:06.739 --> 15:10.543
WELL... I GUESS
AT YOUR WEDDING.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.546
THAT'S THE ONLY TIME
I CAN THINK OF.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.317
LET THIS BE
A LESSON TO YOU, MAX.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.120
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
A LOPEZ MAN HAS TO DO,

15:20.120 --> 15:22.189
NO MATTER
WHAT ANYONE ELSE SAYS.

15:22.189 --> 15:25.292
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
TELL MOM?

15:25.292 --> 15:28.528
'CAUSE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
A LOPEZ MAN LIKES TO DO

15:28.528 --> 15:31.064
AND, UH, WANTS
TO KEEP DOING THEM.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.674
MOM, MOM, WAKE UP.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.244
HUH? WHAT THE HELL
TOOK YOU SO LONG?

15:44.244 --> 15:47.114
I WAS GIVING ANGIE
A BACK RUB TO PUT HER TO SLEEP,

15:47.114 --> 15:49.349
AND SHE STARTED TALKING TO ME
ABOUT HER DAY

15:49.349 --> 15:51.351
AND THE NEXT THING
I KNOW, I WAS OUT.

15:51.351 --> 15:55.155
YOU MADE ME WAIT SO LONG
THAT I DOZED OFF, TOO.

15:55.155 --> 15:59.192
GEORGE, WE HAD A JOB TO DO
AND WE FELL ASLEEP.

15:59.192 --> 16:03.430
WE'RE SLEEPING MEXICANS!

16:03.430 --> 16:04.931
NO, WE'RE NOT.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.933
YOU SEE,
THIS IS WHAT RACISM DOES.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.968
IT MAKES YOU FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT SLEEPING.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.403
EVERYBODY SLEEPS.
IT'S NIGHT.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.042
HEY...

16:15.042 --> 16:18.245
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUTSIDE?
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN BED.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.313
DAD, I'VE GOTTA
SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.050
IT'S SO COOL.
ALL RIGHT. PRESS PLAY.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.518
GET RID
OF THE BATS! COPS!

16:30.090 --> 16:32.659
HEY, SANCHEZ.
COME ON IN.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.161
HEY, GEORGE.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.063
UH, IS YOUR SON HOME?

16:36.063 --> 16:38.398
UH, YEAH.
HE'S UPSTAIRS. WHY?

16:38.398 --> 16:41.068
WELL, I SAW HIM
RUNNING DOWN THE STREET,

16:41.068 --> 16:43.836
THEN I, UH, DROVE PAST
SORKIN'S HOUSE.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.739
SOMEBODY SMASHED
ALL HIS STATUES.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.275
I THINK IT WAS MAX.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.111
GIVE ME A SECOND.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.751
VIVA LA RAZA!

17:05.858 --> 17:07.960
(clattering)

17:07.960 --> 17:10.297
OH, MAN. YOU KNOW...

17:10.297 --> 17:13.466
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND LET ME HANDLE THIS?

17:13.466 --> 17:16.103
I'LL MAKE SURE
THAT MAX PAYS FOR THE STATUES.

17:16.103 --> 17:18.505
LOOK, GEORGE,
YOU'RE MY FRIEND,

17:18.505 --> 17:20.507
SO I'M NOT
GONNA TURN HIM IN.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.475
BUT NEXT TIME,
I MIGHT HAVE TO.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.245
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A NEXT
TIME. I APPRECIATE IT, HECTOR.

17:25.245 --> 17:28.448
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT IT.
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT SORKIN.

17:28.448 --> 17:31.818
APPARENTLY, YOUR WIFE CIRCULATED
A PRETTY STRONGLY WORDED LETTER

17:31.818 --> 17:34.121
THAT SHE SENT TO HIM, AND IT GOT
THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD

17:34.121 --> 17:36.123
FIRED UP ENOUGH
TO START A PETITION.

17:36.123 --> 17:40.227
IT'S AMAZING HOW EFFECTIVE
A LETTER CAN BE.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.795
YEAH... (laughs)
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS MY IDEA.

17:42.795 --> 17:46.333
YOU KNOW, THE PEN IS MIGHTIER
THAN THE SOURCE.

17:50.137 --> 17:52.705
OFFICER SANCHEZ?

17:52.705 --> 17:56.008
IF YOU'RE HERE TO GET MY UNCLE'S
BLESSING TO ASK ME OUT,

17:56.008 --> 17:59.078
DO NOT BOTHER. JUST ASK.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.781
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
DATING A FIREMAN.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.684
WHAT IS THIS, YOUR SALUTE
TO AMERICA'S HEROES?

18:04.684 --> 18:08.388
OH, UNCLE GEORGE,
YOU'RE SO FUNNY. NOW BE QUIET.

18:08.388 --> 18:12.659
I'M FREE SATURDAY.
DO YOU WANT TO GO DANCING?

18:12.659 --> 18:16.563
NAH, I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE
PEOPLE ARE JUDGING ME.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.531
HEY, LET'S JUST
HIT A MOVIE.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.467
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU, GEORGE.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.135
SEE YOU.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.036
MM.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.539
SO YOU'RE UP LATE.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.775
WELL, MAX DID SOMETHING
REALLY STUPID,

18:28.775 --> 18:31.944
AND IT'S MY FAULT FOR SETTING
A BAD EXAMPLE FOR HIM.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.182
OH, REALLY? YEAH. I SAW K-FED
GETTING THROWN OUT OF SKYBAR.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.650
YEAH, WELL...
(clears throat)

18:37.650 --> 18:40.820
I GUESS WE BOTH HAVE IMPORTANT
THINGS TO THINK ABOUT.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.761
RELAX.
OFFICER SANCHEZ IS GONE.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.497
WHAT'D HE SAY?

18:50.497 --> 18:54.267
MAX, HE SAW YOU RUNNING.
HE KNOWS YOU BROKE THE STATUES.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.868
AM I IN TROUBLE?

18:55.868 --> 18:57.170
NO, HE'S GONNA LET IT GO.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.306
YES! WE GOT SORKIN!

18:59.306 --> 19:01.374
MAX, WE DIDN'T GET ANYONE.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.376
WHEN I SAW YOU
IN THAT VIDEO,

19:03.376 --> 19:05.545
YOU LOOKED LIKE
A LITTLE THUG.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.747
MAN, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WANT FOR YOU.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.384
BUT YOU SAID THERE ARE THINGS
A LOPEZ MAN HAS TO DO,

19:11.384 --> 19:13.820
AND YOU DIDN'T CARE
WHEN GRANDMA DID IT.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.523
LOOK, HAVE A SEAT.

19:21.093 --> 19:22.862
I GOT CAUGHT UP
IN THE MOMENT.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.397
I WAS WRONG.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.400
MAX, I DON'T WANT YOU DOING
ANYTHING THAT GRANDMA DOES--

19:27.400 --> 19:29.636
SMOKING, DRINKING,
IDENTITY THEFT.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.905
SHE STOLE SOMEONE'S IDENTITY?

19:32.905 --> 19:37.810
CALL HER JOEY ESPARZA
AND SEE IF SHE TURNS AROUND.

19:40.112 --> 19:41.581
YOU WERE PROUD OF HER.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.850
IS THAT WHY YOU DID THIS,

19:43.850 --> 19:46.619
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
I'D BE PROUD OF YOU?

19:46.619 --> 19:47.954
LOOK, I'M ALWAYS
GONNA BE PROUD OF YOU.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.957
YOU SAID I WASN'T
HELPING THE CAUSE.

19:50.957 --> 19:54.361
MAX, YOU WANNA KNOW
HOW YOU HELP THE CAUSE?

19:54.361 --> 19:55.962
YOU GET AN EDUCATION.

19:55.962 --> 19:59.532
YOU BE SUCCESSFUL SO YOU CAN
BUY AND SELL FOOLS LIKE SORKIN.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.402
HEY, THAT'S HOW
YOU REALLY CHANGE THINGS.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.905
W-WAIT A MINUTE.

20:05.905 --> 20:10.443
YOU CAN'T REALLY
BUY PEOPLE, CAN YOU?

20:10.443 --> 20:12.579
LIKE I SAID, MAX,
GET AN EDUCATION.
