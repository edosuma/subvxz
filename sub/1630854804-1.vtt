14:55.562 --> 14:56.561
No idea?

14:56.788 --> 14:58.454
Nope.

14:58.473 --> 15:00.064
Well, if no one had the motive
to kidnap her,

15:00.291 --> 15:01.524
We'd have to look
at other options.

15:03.052 --> 15:04.460
Mr. Papini, this may be
hard for you to hear,

15:04.553 --> 15:06.220
But redding has
a trafficking problem,

15:06.239 --> 15:07.647
She could've been a good target.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.315
Wha...

15:09.409 --> 15:11.467
What are you telling me?

15:11.560 --> 15:13.394
It's possible
your wife was kidnapped

15:13.413 --> 15:16.581
And coerced into forced labor
or sexual exploitation.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.375
Did she have an issue
with mental health?

15:21.329 --> 15:22.828
Wha...
Wh-- what do you mean?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.756
Did she suffer from...

15:24.983 --> 15:26.407
Depression?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.741
Bipolar disorder?
Schizophrenia?

15:27.835 --> 15:29.743
Drug addiction?

15:29.837 --> 15:32.004
Anything that might explain
a sudden change in behavior,

15:32.157 --> 15:34.323
An altered ability
to make a good decision?

15:34.417 --> 15:38.010
I mean, she'd get anxiety,
but only sometimes.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.395
Can you tell me more?

15:41.166 --> 15:43.274
She'd get overwhelmed,
and she'd cry.

15:44.427 --> 15:46.018
She wasn't...

15:46.112 --> 15:47.520
Crazy.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.949
Look, whatever happened,

15:51.100 --> 15:51.932
Sherri would never
leave the kids,

15:51.952 --> 15:53.693
Not like this.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.411
Somebody did this to us.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.850
My kids.

16:00.943 --> 16:02.351
My kids are at my mom's house.

16:02.445 --> 16:03.795
Can they...
Can they come home, or...?

16:05.131 --> 16:06.539
Yeah.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.632
We're done for today.

16:07.783 --> 16:09.300
Wha-- what do I tell them?

16:13.122 --> 16:14.305
I guess you can't tell me.

Where is mommy?

16:44.504 --> 16:46.170
Um...

16:46.397 --> 16:49.340
Mommy is...

16:49.567 --> 16:51.067
Uh, I need
to tell you two something,

16:51.085 --> 16:51.917
And I need you to listen.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.011
Okay? Honey, sit down.

16:55.590 --> 16:57.590
Your mom has...

16:57.684 --> 16:59.592
Gone on a trip for a few days,

16:59.686 --> 17:01.577
But she'll be back soon.

17:01.596 --> 17:02.745
A trip?

17:02.764 --> 17:04.247
Just a...

17:04.265 --> 17:05.356
A little getaway.

17:05.583 --> 17:06.599
With who?

17:06.693 --> 17:08.151
Just by herself.

17:10.012 --> 17:11.270
She just wanted
to clear her head.

17:11.422 --> 17:12.864
Um, but she told me
to tell you

17:13.015 --> 17:15.941
That she loves you guys
very much,

17:16.036 --> 17:17.869
And, uh, she misses you.

17:20.431 --> 17:21.188
Now, I think--
do we have everything?

17:21.282 --> 17:22.265
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

17:22.283 --> 17:23.291
-Okay?
-Okay.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.901
Welcome home.

17:58.394 --> 17:59.660
It's nice.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.504
Kids, we gotta go!

18:30.276 --> 18:31.400
Kids!

18:33.113 --> 18:34.112
All right, here we go.

19:11.317 --> 19:15.570

19:28.817 --> 19:30.960

19:35.416 --> 19:36.841
[woman] yeah, we're going to go
this way, over here.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.661
Sherri!

19:40.680 --> 19:42.305
Yell "sherri", everyone.

19:44.759 --> 19:46.242
She could've easily just been--

19:46.260 --> 19:47.334
Snatched?

19:47.353 --> 19:48.502
I know. I know.

19:48.596 --> 19:50.079
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

19:50.097 --> 19:51.480
Or disposed of.

19:53.584 --> 19:56.176
A beautiful, blonde,
missing white woman.

19:56.270 --> 19:57.937
Looks good on tv.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.588
He's hiding something.

19:59.682 --> 20:01.848
He was evasive
during questioning.

20:01.943 --> 20:03.016
The only thing
we found on her phone

20:03.110 --> 20:04.351
Was that she was texting
some man

20:04.445 --> 20:06.429
That she'd saved
under a woman's name.

20:06.522 --> 20:08.689
They never met up,
just some light flirtation.

20:08.783 --> 20:10.541
Guy's alibi totally checks out.

20:10.693 --> 20:12.451
We have no other suspects.

20:12.603 --> 20:14.695
What do you think,
she just vanished into thin air?

20:14.789 --> 20:16.622
We've got video proof
of his alibi.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.864
Also airtight.

20:17.959 --> 20:19.442
He was at work.

20:19.535 --> 20:22.127
His bosses handed over
the videos immediately.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.446
Our entire community

20:23.539 --> 20:26.057
Is dedicated
to bring sherri home.

20:26.208 --> 20:28.801
We proved that here today.

20:28.953 --> 20:29.977
I don't know how I'd be able
to keep going without you all.

20:31.305 --> 20:32.813
We're gonna find my wife!

20:43.801 --> 20:45.034
I got you something.

20:49.323 --> 20:50.731
You remembered.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.399
Yeah.

20:52.493 --> 20:54.543
Well, it was your favorite
for years.

20:57.331 --> 20:58.405
I don't think that keith
ever remembered

20:58.424 --> 20:59.257
My favorite ice cream.

21:10.344 --> 21:11.394
I miss my kids so much.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.527
Do you promise
that we'll go and get them?

21:21.114 --> 21:21.946
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
As soon as we can.

21:22.173 --> 21:24.115
Really.

21:24.266 --> 21:25.283
I can't live without them.

21:25.434 --> 21:26.909
As soon as we can.

21:30.348 --> 21:31.772
I'm a terrible mother.

21:31.866 --> 21:33.624
No one knows
what you've been through,

21:33.776 --> 21:36.610
Except me.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.254
You stayed so long
for those kids.

21:46.121 --> 21:48.288
My whole life has just been,
like, one person--

21:48.308 --> 21:50.308
Bad person
after another bad person.

21:52.961 --> 21:55.479
I mean, I can only
blame myself, right?

21:58.133 --> 21:59.542
I should never
have married him.

21:59.560 --> 22:02.302
Sherri...

22:02.322 --> 22:05.397
You told me
your mother beat you.

22:05.491 --> 22:06.741
You were set up to fail.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.578
Look, it's time to start
trusting yourself again.

22:31.184 --> 22:32.308
Son, we need to talk.

22:33.761 --> 22:36.095
Now, I know things were--

22:36.247 --> 22:37.838
Are complicated
with my daughter,

22:37.932 --> 22:39.523
But it doesn't mean
I don't love her.

22:41.586 --> 22:43.510
I know things have been bad
between sherri and I, but--

22:43.529 --> 22:46.489
Look, we don't need
to talk about this right now.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.091
You're right.

22:49.184 --> 22:50.368
There will be time for that.

22:56.283 --> 22:57.166
I brought dinner.

23:06.110 --> 23:06.967
[smoke detector beeping]

23:08.388 --> 23:09.345
Shit.

23:11.298 --> 23:12.348
I got it.
I got it, I got it.

23:19.957 --> 23:21.381
It's all right, guys.
It's okay. It's all right.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.651
Why is mommy's mom still here?

23:25.554 --> 23:29.723
Grandma is here to help us
through this difficult time.

23:29.817 --> 23:31.817
So, we're gonna sit down
like a family

23:31.911 --> 23:33.577
And eat the dinner
she so kindly prepared.

23:35.473 --> 23:36.414
Just try it, please.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.667
Kids!

23:40.920 --> 23:42.920
Come here. Come here.

23:43.147 --> 23:45.831
I'm gonna tell you
a little story. Okay?

23:45.983 --> 23:47.908
When your mommy was little,

23:48.002 --> 23:49.835
She used to ask me
so many questions.

23:49.929 --> 23:53.764
All the questions, all the time.

23:53.916 --> 23:55.674
And one day I said to her,

23:55.826 --> 23:58.752
"sherri, if you ask me
one more question,

23:58.771 --> 24:00.104
I'm gonna cut your tongue off."

24:01.682 --> 24:03.274
Oh, it was funny.

24:03.425 --> 24:04.191
[laughs awkwardly]

24:11.433 --> 24:13.284
You were the most
beautiful girl in high school.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.288
And you're still

24:17.439 --> 24:18.789
The most beautiful girl
in the world.

24:22.870 --> 24:24.186
It's been so long

24:24.205 --> 24:25.421
Since I've heard
nice words like that.

24:27.692 --> 24:29.091
You're gonna be
hearing them every day.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.262
We're together.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.314
I'm so tired.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.727
Can I go to sleep now, chris?

24:48.821 --> 24:49.987
Yeah, of course, my pet.

24:54.552 --> 24:55.618
I love you.

24:57.479 --> 24:59.747
Would it be okay
if I sleep alone?

25:03.728 --> 25:05.577
Yeah.

25:05.730 --> 25:08.488
Okay.

25:08.582 --> 25:09.840
I want you
to be comfortable.

25:10.993 --> 25:11.842
Thank you.

25:11.994 --> 25:13.177
Of course.

25:16.349 --> 25:17.681

26:23.583 --> 26:25.657
Will they do that?

26:25.751 --> 26:27.251
That's their whole m.O..

Glad I have you.

Emotions are good,
but don't go overboard.

26:33.651 --> 26:35.408
Everyone's looking
for you to make a wrong move.

26:35.428 --> 26:36.760
Just tell your truth.

26:40.582 --> 26:43.008
Keith, your wife
has been missing for five days.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.918
I know she was taken.

26:44.937 --> 26:48.330
My family knows she was taken.

26:48.349 --> 26:50.332
But they can't come out,
obviously, and say "abduction"

26:50.351 --> 26:53.001
Because they don't have
the evidence.

26:53.095 --> 26:54.069
I mean, that was
hard to hear, but...

26:55.931 --> 26:57.522
I'm coming, honey.

26:57.675 --> 26:58.690
I'm trying.

26:58.843 --> 26:59.858
I'm doing everything I can.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.193
And...

27:01.345 --> 27:02.786
I love you.

27:03.013 --> 27:05.748
And if the sheriff's office
won't find my wife, I will.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.444
[interviewer] most people
don't agree to this.

27:11.538 --> 27:12.946
I've got nothing to hide.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.524
Keith, did you kill your wife?

27:15.542 --> 27:17.042
Absolutely not.

27:17.194 --> 27:18.552
Do you know where sherri is?

27:20.698 --> 27:21.472
No.

I'm not there.

I'm not there, and...

That's why I'm so determined
to solve this case.

42:11.345 --> 42:13.755
You grew up without a lot.

42:13.773 --> 42:16.699
So did I.

43:47.274 --> 43:50.034
And the older woman,

43:50.128 --> 43:53.129
She was mean,

43:53.280 --> 43:54.631
And had thin eyebrows.

43:56.542 --> 43:57.383
They were both mexican.

44:02.382 --> 44:03.806
What else do you remember
about your time in the van?

44:05.143 --> 44:06.309
Not that much.

44:10.649 --> 44:12.148
I would never
leave our children.

44:19.883 --> 44:20.823
They tried to kill me.

44:22.994 --> 44:24.902
Um...

44:24.996 --> 44:28.122
Sherri, what can you tell us
about the drive there?

44:34.673 --> 44:38.323
They took me by gunpoint
to the van.

44:38.343 --> 44:40.902
And when they were dragging me,

44:40.995 --> 44:45.406
I took out my earphones
with some of my hair,

44:45.425 --> 44:48.333
And I left it on the side
of the road with my phone

44:48.353 --> 44:49.686
For you to come find me, baby.

44:51.414 --> 44:52.438
You did that for me?

44:54.025 --> 44:55.274
Of course, I did.

44:59.939 --> 45:00.947
I knew that you would
come find me.

45:04.610 --> 45:05.785
You're my hero.

45:10.116 --> 45:11.374
You're my big, strong hero.

45:13.378 --> 45:14.377
Okay. Okay, I think
we need to stop.

45:14.604 --> 45:15.712
Now.

45:18.866 --> 45:20.458
Women almost never
kidnap other women.

45:20.552 --> 45:21.718
And former cops?

45:21.945 --> 45:23.535
What could the possible motive
have been?

45:23.555 --> 45:24.628
I can't see one.

45:24.723 --> 45:25.471
[reporter] mr. Papini!

45:26.891 --> 45:27.849
Mr. Papini!
How is sherri?

45:28.968 --> 45:30.468
Did she say who did it?

45:30.620 --> 45:32.711
We are overwhelmed with joy

45:32.731 --> 45:34.121
With how supportive
everyone has been

45:34.140 --> 45:35.289
Bringing our family
together again.

45:35.308 --> 45:37.475
Everyone's tireless efforts

45:37.627 --> 45:39.402
Has made our family whole
for thanksgiving.

45:39.553 --> 45:40.737
And that...

45:42.632 --> 45:44.991
Thank you for allowing
our family time to heal.

45:52.233 --> 45:56.419
[♪♪]

46:08.249 --> 46:12.226
[♪♪]

46:22.596 --> 46:26.073
[♪♪]

46:32.348 --> 46:33.748
[reporter] sherri papini,
can we ask you a few questions?

46:39.522 --> 46:40.630
[reporters clamoring]

46:44.803 --> 46:46.302
[reporters clamoring]

46:49.549 --> 46:51.557
What is the description
of the abductors?

46:53.812 --> 46:56.145
[reporters clamoring]

47:00.543 --> 47:02.819
Mommy!

47:06.232 --> 47:07.323
-Mommy!
-It's okay.

47:08.885 --> 47:10.326
It's okay.
I love you both so much.

47:12.313 --> 47:13.162
It's okay to be sad.

47:15.908 --> 47:17.333
Our family
were meant to be together.

47:19.320 --> 47:19.961
[sherri's mom] hi, sherri.

47:29.681 --> 47:31.013
Hi, mom.

47:39.023 --> 47:43.860
[♪♪]

47:48.682 --> 47:50.199
I'm glad you're home.

47:52.095 --> 47:53.369
Me too.

47:55.707 --> 47:56.706
I want you to know, I...

48:00.211 --> 48:02.837
I did what I thought was best.

48:08.945 --> 48:10.011
I...

48:11.948 --> 48:13.389
I love you, sherri.

48:20.214 --> 48:21.522
I'm so sorry, sherri.

48:23.643 --> 48:25.401
I should've paid
more attention to you.

48:27.463 --> 48:28.571
I wasn't a very good husband.

48:31.392 --> 48:32.909
I love you so much.

48:35.471 --> 48:36.746
And I miss you so much.

48:39.325 --> 48:40.750
I just want us to be happy.

48:43.496 --> 48:44.754
What we have is really special.

48:46.832 --> 48:49.166
I will fight for that
for the rest of my life,

48:49.318 --> 48:50.217
I promise you that.

48:52.989 --> 48:53.930
I'm never gonna lose you again.

48:57.994 --> 49:01.495
I want to be your love forever,

49:01.514 --> 49:03.230
Without a break or decay.

49:05.334 --> 49:07.518
When the hills are all flat,

49:07.670 --> 49:08.778
And the rivers run dry.

49:12.341 --> 49:13.532
Our vows.

49:17.513 --> 49:18.579
I love you so much.

49:20.199 --> 49:21.582
Not as much as I love you.

49:36.641 --> 49:37.556
Dna came back.

49:38.977 --> 49:41.535
No female dna
found on any of her clothes,

49:41.554 --> 49:44.054
But there was male dna
found on her underwear.

49:44.148 --> 49:46.223
And it's not keith's.

49:46.317 --> 49:47.558
Who does it belong to?

49:47.652 --> 49:49.043
No match yet.

49:49.136 --> 49:52.229
We'll keep searching
every week, but...

49:52.381 --> 49:53.731
At least it's something.

49:53.825 --> 49:55.157
People in the latino community
are living in fear.

49:55.309 --> 49:57.476
What's your point?

49:57.495 --> 50:00.070
That we need to find out
who did this.

50:00.223 --> 50:01.414
And not just for her safety.

50:15.738 --> 50:16.512
What's on your mind?

50:18.574 --> 50:21.425
I know you already said no,

50:21.577 --> 50:22.743
But we're getting
a lot of offers

50:22.762 --> 50:23.686
For exclusive interviews.

50:25.356 --> 50:26.671
Keith, I can't--

50:26.691 --> 50:27.672
I know. I know.

50:27.692 --> 50:29.750
And it-- it was...

50:29.769 --> 50:31.101
It was really hard on me,

50:31.195 --> 50:33.195
And I can't imagine
what it would be like for you,

50:33.422 --> 50:35.589
But...

50:35.608 --> 50:36.782
It could be a lot of money.

50:38.369 --> 50:39.785
And--
and we could set the terms.

50:43.616 --> 50:45.374
I don't think
I could get through it.

50:48.695 --> 50:49.837
You understand, right?

50:51.716 --> 50:52.965
Of course, I do.

50:54.610 --> 50:56.610
I'm so happy
to be back with you.

50:56.629 --> 50:59.138
Sherri, that money
could really help us.

51:04.228 --> 51:06.395
When I was...

51:06.622 --> 51:07.879
Chained up,

51:07.899 --> 51:10.474
And using kitty litter
as a bathroom,

51:10.626 --> 51:12.068
I thought when I came home,

51:12.219 --> 51:14.070
That all of our problems
would just seem stupid.

51:23.748 --> 51:25.247
And I was wrong.

51:25.474 --> 51:27.308
I just want the rest
of our lives to be easy.

51:27.326 --> 51:28.751
That's...

51:28.902 --> 51:30.068
That's all I want.

51:30.088 --> 51:31.504
What about the gofundme money?

51:34.984 --> 51:36.817
Like, couldn't we use that?

51:36.836 --> 51:38.076
For us?

51:38.096 --> 51:39.578
For-- for our debts,
for our bills?

51:39.597 --> 51:40.554
Like, that's it.

51:42.825 --> 51:44.100
Yeah, maybe.

51:51.425 --> 51:52.399
I want you.

51:54.170 --> 51:55.444
You...

51:59.117 --> 52:00.674
Are you sure?

52:00.693 --> 52:03.452
Are--
are you ready?

52:03.679 --> 52:04.787
Yes.

52:08.626 --> 52:10.017
Okay.

52:10.035 --> 52:11.377
There's something
I wanna show you first.

52:13.856 --> 52:14.755
Okay.

52:24.308 --> 52:26.308
What is... This?

52:27.645 --> 52:28.602
They branded me.

52:31.207 --> 52:32.106
They should be burned alive.

52:33.317 --> 52:34.150
Both of them.

52:35.544 --> 52:36.902
"exodus"?

52:40.491 --> 52:41.657
I looked it up.

52:43.903 --> 52:45.286
It's a story in the bible
about freed slaves.

52:46.889 --> 52:48.122
Oh...

52:49.742 --> 52:50.916
It's okay.

52:53.913 --> 52:55.087
All that matters is
that I'm back with you.

52:58.342 --> 52:59.425
Kiss me.

53:01.570 --> 53:02.678
Please.

53:21.014 --> 53:22.756
You're mine forever.

53:22.775 --> 53:24.366
Yeah. Yeah.

53:48.951 --> 53:50.467
Hi.

53:50.561 --> 53:51.727
I hope you like cookies.

53:53.046 --> 53:54.455
Thanks for coming in.

53:54.473 --> 53:55.898
I know it's hard for you
when keith is working.

53:56.049 --> 53:57.066
It's okay.

53:58.719 --> 54:00.552
Is detective bertain here?

54:00.571 --> 54:01.720
I'm the detective on the case.

54:01.814 --> 54:02.821
I lead the questioning.

54:07.728 --> 54:08.744
Have a seat, please.

54:22.318 --> 54:24.001
Okay, so...

54:24.153 --> 54:25.594
Why don't you tell me
how your day started?

54:27.932 --> 54:28.931
I'd hardly sleep.

54:30.326 --> 54:31.325
They...

54:31.343 --> 54:33.994
They...

54:34.013 --> 54:36.438
They kept me in a closet.

54:36.665 --> 54:38.849
They had me chained.

54:39.001 --> 54:44.697
They would let me relieve myself
in kitty litter.

54:46.008 --> 54:48.692
And, if I was lucky,

54:48.844 --> 54:50.452
They would let me take a shower.

54:50.604 --> 54:51.770
But I'd...

54:51.789 --> 54:53.205
I'd really like
to focus on today.

54:55.017 --> 54:57.442
Molly...

54:57.461 --> 54:58.610
You know,
I finally have my dignity.

54:58.704 --> 55:00.370
I'm not a hero,

55:00.523 --> 55:04.525
But, I'm-- I'm thankful.

55:04.543 --> 55:06.593
I'm really thankful
for my freedom.

55:08.531 --> 55:11.289
When you were being driven
to the place you were held in,

55:11.309 --> 55:12.725
Did you hear anything
on the radio?

55:15.871 --> 55:17.313
They played mariachi music.

55:19.041 --> 55:20.316
Did you hear any ads
in between the music?

55:22.545 --> 55:25.729
If it was something local,
it might help pin down your...

55:25.823 --> 55:27.156
Where your location was.

55:29.493 --> 55:31.160
They spoke spanish,
and I didn't--

55:31.387 --> 55:33.053
I didn't understand
what they were saying.

55:33.072 --> 55:34.905
You've lived in california
your whole life.

55:35.057 --> 55:36.290
You don't understand
any spanish?

55:37.560 --> 55:39.409
No.

55:39.562 --> 55:44.398
They fed me rice
and tortillas.

55:44.416 --> 55:48.068
They...

55:48.161 --> 55:51.588
Went with me
when I went to the shower.

55:51.740 --> 55:54.683
And they chained me to a pole.

55:57.913 --> 56:00.004
They let you shower,

56:00.024 --> 56:01.523
But they made you use
the bathroom in kitty litter?

56:05.196 --> 56:06.153
They tased me.

56:10.275 --> 56:12.016
They tased me, and, um,

56:12.036 --> 56:13.927
My brain just--

56:13.946 --> 56:15.037
It doesn't work the same.

56:17.266 --> 56:19.616
It's...

56:19.710 --> 56:22.269
I have, um, trouble putting
all the pieces together.

56:22.287 --> 56:23.712
You know?

56:23.939 --> 56:25.005
That's what you're saying
happened?

56:27.276 --> 56:30.869
I...

56:30.963 --> 56:32.388
I'm really sorry.

56:34.892 --> 56:36.299
I just-- I...

56:36.394 --> 56:37.559
I can't remember it all.

56:38.787 --> 56:39.895
Sorry.

56:48.239 --> 56:49.980
You feel okay...

56:50.074 --> 56:53.558
Being out here?

56:53.577 --> 56:54.985
Yeah.

56:55.137 --> 56:57.246
People are curious.
I can understand why.

56:59.825 --> 57:01.583
I'm so sorry,
but are you sherri papini?

57:04.146 --> 57:05.328
Yes.

57:05.481 --> 57:07.164
Told you.

57:07.258 --> 57:09.332
We just wanted to tell you
how much we admire you.

57:09.427 --> 57:11.334
You really woke us up.

57:11.487 --> 57:12.928
It's not so safe
in perfect redding anymore.

57:14.432 --> 57:16.673
What kind young women you are.

57:16.767 --> 57:19.101
Well, if I can make this place
safer for one woman,

57:19.252 --> 57:20.827
Then I guess

57:20.846 --> 57:22.104
My horrible experience
was worth it.

57:23.499 --> 57:24.273
Well, we'll let you
keep eating.

57:24.500 --> 57:25.441
Oh, thanks.

57:25.592 --> 57:27.517
I'm loretta, by the way.

57:27.611 --> 57:28.760
Sherri's mother.

57:28.779 --> 57:29.945
We're so sorry
for you, too, ma'am.

57:30.096 --> 57:31.238
Thank you.

57:35.177 --> 57:36.201
Do you know
what they call them?

57:38.622 --> 57:39.705
Tragedy groupies.

57:46.021 --> 57:49.539
I've been meaning to talk
to you about something.

57:49.692 --> 57:51.374
Um...

57:51.469 --> 57:55.045
I know the press wants
to do an exclusive with you.

57:55.197 --> 57:56.722
I know it's a lot of money.

57:59.793 --> 58:02.703
Investigative journalists,
they ask...

58:02.721 --> 58:03.979
They ask tough questions.

58:04.130 --> 58:05.296
They're waiting for a...

58:05.316 --> 58:06.223
A "gotcha" moment.

58:06.375 --> 58:07.649
Mom...

58:09.970 --> 58:12.212
I'm sorry.

58:12.231 --> 58:14.564
I just...

58:14.717 --> 58:16.049
I want you to know,

58:16.068 --> 58:22.405
If there is anything
that you wanna tell me...

58:22.500 --> 58:23.499
Anything, I--

58:23.650 --> 58:25.834
I'm here to listen.

58:26.061 --> 58:28.462
What kind of thing
would I need to tell you?

58:36.514 --> 58:39.906
I remember everything...

58:39.925 --> 58:40.933
That happened between us.

58:43.912 --> 58:46.772
Every single thing.

59:02.097 --> 59:03.539
Keith...

59:03.766 --> 59:06.933
Seven years.

59:06.952 --> 59:08.952
This last year
was the hardest of our lives,

59:09.046 --> 59:11.121
But we made it.

59:11.215 --> 59:13.715
We were put back together,
because we're meant to be.

59:13.942 --> 59:14.958
I love you.

59:15.052 --> 59:15.968
I love you, baby.

59:22.117 --> 59:23.800
Cheers!

59:23.952 --> 59:26.469
Cheers.

59:26.564 --> 59:27.729
Congratulations.

59:37.241 --> 59:38.465
I can't tell you both

59:38.558 --> 59:39.891
How much your friendship
has meant to me

59:39.985 --> 59:42.244
During this terrible,
terrible time.

59:42.395 --> 59:44.562
Of course, sherri.

59:44.582 --> 59:47.732
We'll always be there for you.

59:47.751 --> 59:51.828
When I was with
those other women,

59:51.922 --> 59:53.088
It was so awful.

59:54.908 --> 59:56.833
And you couldn't
fight them off?

59:56.985 --> 59:59.761
No.

59:59.913 --> 1:00:02.431
They were, like...

1:00:02.658 --> 1:00:04.248
Huge.

1:00:04.268 --> 1:00:05.416
Like, heavyset.

1:00:05.510 --> 1:00:06.660
There was--
there was no way.

1:00:06.753 --> 1:00:10.013
But the police description

1:00:10.165 --> 1:00:11.440
Said that they weren't
much bigger than you.

1:00:19.341 --> 1:00:20.699
That's the thing, you know?

1:00:22.620 --> 1:00:24.119
They ask you, like,
do all these sketches,

1:00:24.270 --> 1:00:25.028
And all these things,

1:00:25.122 --> 1:00:28.031
And it's just...

1:00:28.183 --> 1:00:29.182
They make mistakes.

1:00:29.201 --> 1:00:30.626
I just...

1:00:33.188 --> 1:00:34.379
Did you like the cake?

1:00:35.633 --> 1:00:36.465
-Yeah, it was great.
-Yeah?

1:00:38.210 --> 1:00:39.542
You were married to sherri
for how long?

1:00:39.637 --> 1:00:41.194
Uh... Five years.

1:00:41.287 --> 1:00:42.638
I was deployed
for most of it.

1:00:42.865 --> 1:00:43.788
And now?

1:00:43.807 --> 1:00:46.199
I'm a veteran.

1:00:46.292 --> 1:00:47.934
I served in iraq
and got an honorable discharge.

1:00:49.721 --> 1:00:51.104
Our marriage was a lie.

1:00:52.316 --> 1:00:54.632
I was her friend.

1:00:54.652 --> 1:00:56.059
I married her

1:00:56.153 --> 1:00:57.711
Because she said she needed
my medical insurance.

1:00:57.804 --> 1:00:59.655
Why did she need
your medical insurance?

1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:02.824
First, she said
it was a heart murmur.

1:01:03.051 --> 1:01:04.885
Then, she said
she needed medical attention

1:01:04.978 --> 1:01:07.220
Because she'd repeatedly
donated her eggs.

1:01:07.239 --> 1:01:10.056
She repeatedly donated
her eggs? Why?

1:01:10.150 --> 1:01:12.793
She said it was
for the money.

1:01:14.505 --> 1:01:16.654
And the truth is, I...

1:01:16.674 --> 1:01:18.064
I have no idea.

1:01:18.158 --> 1:01:19.824
I don't even know
if that's true.

1:01:19.843 --> 1:01:21.735
You can't trust
a word she says.

1:01:21.753 --> 1:01:23.327
She lies about everything.

1:01:23.347 --> 1:01:24.421
You know, small things
that didn't matter.

1:01:24.573 --> 1:01:25.663
Huge things that did matter.

1:01:25.683 --> 1:01:27.182
Can you give me
concrete examples?

1:01:28.852 --> 1:01:29.759
She used to claim
that her mom, loretta,

1:01:29.853 --> 1:01:31.578
Would beat her,

1:01:31.671 --> 1:01:32.521
And then lock her
in the basement.

1:01:33.857 --> 1:01:35.339
That's the thing

1:01:35.359 --> 1:01:36.266
I just couldn't stop
thinking about

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:37.842
When all this started.

1:01:37.861 --> 1:01:39.343
It's, like,
"how different is that

1:01:39.363 --> 1:01:40.678
Than what's happening
right now?"

1:01:40.698 --> 1:01:42.605
Why are you coming forward now?

1:01:42.758 --> 1:01:44.199
I saw your press conference.

1:01:46.278 --> 1:01:47.369
I struggled with this decision.

1:01:48.931 --> 1:01:51.355
Sherri--
she's a part of my past.

1:01:51.375 --> 1:01:52.615
A part that
I don't want to revisit,

1:01:52.710 --> 1:01:53.458
But a part, nonetheless.

1:01:55.771 --> 1:01:56.670
Why should I believe you?

1:01:59.291 --> 1:02:00.957
What do I got to lie about?

1:02:01.109 --> 1:02:02.342
I'm embarrassed by all this.

1:02:06.131 --> 1:02:09.282
We called you here today
about the papini case.

1:02:09.301 --> 1:02:11.209
Due to the tremendous
national interest,

1:02:11.228 --> 1:02:13.303
We are here to make a statement.

1:02:13.455 --> 1:02:15.546
And it goes as follows...

1:02:15.566 --> 1:02:19.550
This investigation
is far from over.

1:02:19.570 --> 1:02:21.570
In fact, it's just begun
a new chapter.

1:02:25.576 --> 1:02:27.892
Welcome to a meeting
for survivors...

1:02:27.911 --> 1:02:30.245
For women-in-arms
who suffer with ptsd.

1:02:30.472 --> 1:02:33.248
I feel so lucky
to be leading this group today.

1:02:34.826 --> 1:02:36.585
United, we can find
strength again.

1:02:38.663 --> 1:02:39.546
Would anyone like to share?

1:02:44.244 --> 1:02:45.151
I'd like to share.

1:02:45.170 --> 1:02:46.553
Go ahead.

1:02:49.582 --> 1:02:51.082
I just wanted to ask

1:02:51.101 --> 1:02:53.584
When I'm gonna feel
normal again.

1:02:53.604 --> 1:02:57.588
I-- I-- I know there aren't
timelines, or anything,

1:02:57.608 --> 1:03:04.004
But everything just feels
so surreal after my assault.

1:03:04.097 --> 1:03:06.597
And I feel hyper-vigilant.

1:03:06.617 --> 1:03:10.101
Like, I always need
to know what's...

1:03:10.195 --> 1:03:11.119
What's behind me.

1:03:13.698 --> 1:03:14.790
Even if I know
there's nothing there.

1:03:21.206 --> 1:03:23.298
"being white is more than
just being aware of my skin,

1:03:23.525 --> 1:03:25.300
But of standing
behind skinheads,

1:03:25.527 --> 1:03:27.285
Who are always around
in spirit, as well,

1:03:27.304 --> 1:03:28.804
And having pride for my country.

1:03:29.031 --> 1:03:31.973
Being white is my family,
my roots, my way of life.

1:03:32.125 --> 1:03:33.141
It's always there.

1:03:33.293 --> 1:03:34.217
There's no denying it.

1:03:34.311 --> 1:03:35.126
It's nobility.

1:03:35.220 --> 1:03:36.144
It's strength."

1:03:36.296 --> 1:03:37.295
Sherri wrote this?

1:03:37.314 --> 1:03:38.814
Using her maiden name, graeff.

1:03:39.041 --> 1:03:40.540
Where'd you find it?

1:03:40.559 --> 1:03:41.891
After scouring the dark corners
of the internet,

1:03:41.985 --> 1:03:43.543
I need a shower.

1:03:43.562 --> 1:03:45.045
Hey.

1:03:45.063 --> 1:03:46.321
First, we gotta find out
if this is real.

1:03:49.993 --> 1:03:51.551
A young latino guy
just got jumped

1:03:51.570 --> 1:03:53.403
And he's in the hospital.

1:03:53.497 --> 1:03:54.404
I think she wrote it.

1:03:54.498 --> 1:03:56.498
I think it's meaningful.

1:03:56.649 --> 1:03:59.059
This has hurt a lot of people
in the community, anthony.

1:03:59.152 --> 1:04:00.627
Specifically people
that look like me.

1:04:03.006 --> 1:04:04.247
You know there's been
an increase in hate crimes.

1:04:04.399 --> 1:04:05.582
I think it's linked.

1:04:05.734 --> 1:04:08.969
I hear you,
but we still need a smoking gun.

1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:15.141
Would anyone else
like to share?

1:04:26.088 --> 1:04:27.153
Go ahead.

1:04:29.867 --> 1:04:31.324
What happened to me
hurt a lot of people.

1:04:34.538 --> 1:04:36.037
Specifically my family
and my children.

1:04:38.767 --> 1:04:41.101
People are saying that
I'm a hero, but I'm not.

1:04:41.119 --> 1:04:46.047
I'm just a regular woman.

1:04:49.369 --> 1:04:50.343
And, um...

1:04:52.114 --> 1:04:55.015
Like amy said, it's--
it just all feels surreal.

1:05:06.128 --> 1:05:07.235
Hi.

1:05:10.132 --> 1:05:11.364
How tall were they?

1:05:12.801 --> 1:05:14.634
Who?

1:05:14.653 --> 1:05:16.578
The girls who took you.

1:05:16.805 --> 1:05:18.229
How tall were they?

1:05:18.248 --> 1:05:21.065
Taller than me.

1:05:21.159 --> 1:05:22.083
I don't remember exactly.

1:05:25.088 --> 1:05:26.646
I don't know.

1:05:26.665 --> 1:05:27.422
You don't remember anything else
about their faces?

1:05:29.259 --> 1:05:32.669
Not from what I said.

1:05:32.821 --> 1:05:34.003
I've said everything already.

1:05:34.097 --> 1:05:36.322
It's kinda weird.

1:05:36.341 --> 1:05:37.432
You were staring at them
for three weeks.

1:05:39.436 --> 1:05:40.352
Did they say anything?

1:05:42.773 --> 1:05:44.164
They talked about my brand...

1:05:44.182 --> 1:05:45.273
Exodus.

1:05:47.093 --> 1:05:50.170
Wait, they talked about
your brand in english,

1:05:50.188 --> 1:05:51.613
But everything else
was in spanish?

1:05:53.024 --> 1:05:54.357
Yes, keith.
They did.

1:05:54.451 --> 1:05:56.843
Are you sure?

1:05:56.861 --> 1:05:57.953
Sherri, you don't remember
anything else at all?

1:05:58.104 --> 1:06:01.531
I'm traumatized...

1:06:01.625 --> 1:06:04.517
And all of this is very surreal.

1:06:04.536 --> 1:06:05.943
And I'm hyper-vigilant.

1:06:05.963 --> 1:06:06.944
Come on, sherri.

1:06:06.964 --> 1:06:08.588
Don't!

1:06:10.542 --> 1:06:12.133
There are things
I'm remembering, right--

1:06:12.360 --> 1:06:13.710
Horrible things--
from when they took me.

1:06:13.804 --> 1:06:14.803
And every time

1:06:14.954 --> 1:06:15.878
You just keep
asking me a question

1:06:15.973 --> 1:06:17.363
Over and over and over again,

1:06:17.382 --> 1:06:20.141
I have to keep reliving it!

1:06:20.293 --> 1:06:21.384
I wanna forget it!

1:06:21.478 --> 1:06:24.962
Sherri, we can't just forget it.

1:06:24.982 --> 1:06:27.724
It happened to us.

1:06:27.876 --> 1:06:29.876
But... Sherri, I'm here.

1:06:29.894 --> 1:06:30.986
Talk to me.

1:06:31.137 --> 1:06:32.395
Let me help.

1:06:32.547 --> 1:06:33.488
What things are you remembering?

1:06:38.386 --> 1:06:40.144
No.

1:06:40.163 --> 1:06:41.312
I'm not ready.

1:06:41.406 --> 1:06:42.998
Well, then we have to go
to the police.

1:06:48.154 --> 1:06:49.487
I cannot keep reliving

1:06:49.581 --> 1:06:51.748
These horrible, horrible
memories

1:06:51.900 --> 1:06:53.249
Over and over and over again.

1:06:53.401 --> 1:06:55.418
Please!

1:06:55.570 --> 1:06:56.803
We don't have a choice!

1:06:58.590 --> 1:07:00.164
Because if we don't stop
these bitches,

1:07:00.258 --> 1:07:03.351
They're gonna do it
to somebody else.

1:07:03.578 --> 1:07:05.353
And I can't live with myself
knowing that.

1:07:08.416 --> 1:07:10.007
I am not...

1:07:10.027 --> 1:07:11.434
Going...

1:07:11.528 --> 1:07:12.819
To the police!

1:07:15.257 --> 1:07:16.448
I remembered
some things that happened to me.

1:07:18.869 --> 1:07:20.684
We were talking.

1:07:20.704 --> 1:07:22.037
I told her she had to come in.

1:07:27.102 --> 1:07:28.434
Even though that this is hard,

1:07:28.528 --> 1:07:29.961
I think that it's
the right thing to do.

1:07:34.885 --> 1:07:36.342
I remember...

1:07:38.113 --> 1:07:40.797
...Um...

1:07:40.949 --> 1:07:44.284
Being chained to the closet,

1:07:44.302 --> 1:07:46.135
Going to the bathroom
in the kitty box.

1:07:46.229 --> 1:07:49.880
And I remember the other woman--

1:07:49.900 --> 1:07:51.140
The older woman--

1:07:51.293 --> 1:07:52.400
Hitting me so hard.

1:07:54.905 --> 1:07:55.987
What about the...?

1:07:59.150 --> 1:08:00.300
Oh.

1:08:00.393 --> 1:08:03.636
And, um...

1:08:03.655 --> 1:08:05.396
When they were branding me,

1:08:05.415 --> 1:08:06.915
They said something
about exodus.

1:08:10.145 --> 1:08:11.711
It's a story about
freed slaves in the bible.

1:08:14.925 --> 1:08:15.924
Tell her about that younger one.

1:08:18.411 --> 1:08:19.836
Keith, I'm gonna ask

1:08:19.988 --> 1:08:21.912
That you let sherri share
what she remembers.

1:08:21.932 --> 1:08:23.681
I just want to get your version
of the story, sherri.

1:08:24.935 --> 1:08:26.101
Just your version alone.

1:08:27.829 --> 1:08:28.937
I'll, uh...

1:08:29.088 --> 1:08:29.938
I'll go wait outside.

1:08:41.343 --> 1:08:44.452
Mrs. Papini, do you know...

1:08:44.679 --> 1:08:45.453
A mr. David dreyfus?

1:08:48.533 --> 1:08:49.457
Yes.

1:08:53.188 --> 1:08:54.854
Haven't thought about him
in a while, but yes.

1:08:54.873 --> 1:08:55.880
Well, he's been
thinking about you.

1:08:57.950 --> 1:08:59.116
He paid us a visit

1:08:59.136 --> 1:09:00.543
And shared us

1:09:00.637 --> 1:09:01.886
Some very interesting
information about your past.

1:09:07.978 --> 1:09:09.144
Do you know
what you're looking at?

1:09:10.538 --> 1:09:12.372
No.

1:09:12.390 --> 1:09:15.132
It's a police report...

1:09:15.152 --> 1:09:16.484
From your mother.

1:09:16.711 --> 1:09:19.562
She claimed
that you were abusing yourself

1:09:19.656 --> 1:09:20.655
And blaming it on her.

1:09:24.310 --> 1:09:26.161
Sherri, is there anything else
you wanna tell us?

1:09:32.169 --> 1:09:33.001
No, ms. Rowlands.

1:09:49.519 --> 1:09:50.602
Thanks for coming.

1:09:51.930 --> 1:09:53.188
You know sherri papini?

1:09:55.841 --> 1:09:57.508
Uh, look, I don't wanna
get anyone in trouble.

1:09:57.527 --> 1:09:59.769
No one's going
to get into trouble,

1:09:59.921 --> 1:10:00.862
If they didn't do
anything illegal.

1:10:03.441 --> 1:10:04.532
We just want to figure out
what happened.

1:10:05.851 --> 1:10:07.118
We need your help.

1:10:09.431 --> 1:10:10.622
It's an opportunity
for you to do some good.

1:10:12.934 --> 1:10:13.958
For the whole community.

1:10:15.879 --> 1:10:16.836
I don't know her.

1:10:22.052 --> 1:10:23.468
She was engaged to my cousin.

1:10:25.463 --> 1:10:26.704
Can you confirm

1:10:26.723 --> 1:10:28.539
If this is a picture
of your cousin, chris?

1:10:28.558 --> 1:10:30.283
You promise
he won't get in trouble?

1:10:30.301 --> 1:10:32.468
I can't make any promises.

1:10:32.562 --> 1:10:33.811
But it's a crime to lie to me.

1:10:41.571 --> 1:10:43.145
I saw sherri at chris' place.

1:10:43.298 --> 1:10:45.222
When she was reported missing?

1:10:45.242 --> 1:10:46.574
And this is him?

1:10:48.970 --> 1:10:49.744
Yeah.

1:10:52.824 --> 1:10:54.231
Why didn't you
come forward earlier?

1:10:54.251 --> 1:10:56.642
Would you have?

1:10:56.661 --> 1:10:57.502
I wanted to stay out
of the whole thing.

1:11:01.258 --> 1:11:02.757
Dang, is this 'cause
I did 23andme?

1:11:24.114 --> 1:11:28.241
[♪♪]

1:11:38.277 --> 1:11:39.627
She's the love of my life.

1:11:42.299 --> 1:11:43.381
I need you to know that.

1:11:46.452 --> 1:11:48.136
Anything I did,
I did because of that.

1:11:49.955 --> 1:11:50.805
We were together
when I was younger.

1:11:53.384 --> 1:11:55.101
And I knew then
that I wanted to marry her.

1:11:57.221 --> 1:11:58.730
But I was too immature,
so she left.

1:12:02.377 --> 1:12:05.803
When she said
that she needed my help...

1:12:05.897 --> 1:12:07.280
It felt heaven-sent,
you know?

1:12:09.642 --> 1:12:10.992
I was finally
gonna get my girl back.

1:12:12.978 --> 1:12:15.830
How long were you
and mrs. Papini in touch for?

1:12:15.981 --> 1:12:17.123
Before she alleges
her kidnapping?

1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:19.667
Six months.

1:12:23.081 --> 1:12:24.747
Can you tell me about
the day of her disappearance?

1:12:24.841 --> 1:12:28.826
I should have known then
that it wasn't gonna...

1:12:28.845 --> 1:12:30.511
Go the way that I planned it.

1:12:30.738 --> 1:12:32.764
We were talking
on burner phones.

1:12:37.245 --> 1:12:38.269
[engine turns over]

1:12:40.506 --> 1:12:41.481
Sherri, come on.
We gotta get going.

1:12:44.769 --> 1:12:45.943
I'm saving our asses, okay?

1:12:47.939 --> 1:12:49.088
Where's your car?

1:12:49.107 --> 1:12:50.590
I rented the van.

1:12:50.608 --> 1:12:51.699
What were you thinking?

1:12:51.851 --> 1:12:53.034
I was excited.

1:12:53.261 --> 1:12:54.369
I wanted to see you.

1:13:02.545 --> 1:13:05.630
[♪♪]

1:13:10.387 --> 1:13:11.302
Wake up, sleepy-head.

1:13:13.038 --> 1:13:13.963
How'd she spend her time here?

1:13:14.057 --> 1:13:16.298
[chris]<i> she cleaned.</i>

1:13:16.451 --> 1:13:17.392
<i> A lot.</i>

1:13:19.562 --> 1:13:22.897
I think being stuck here got
pretty old for her pretty quick.

1:13:25.551 --> 1:13:26.459
I don't know
what she did all day,

1:13:26.552 --> 1:13:29.145
But when I got home from work,

1:13:29.239 --> 1:13:31.072
She'd be watching tv.

1:13:31.223 --> 1:13:32.481
[reporter]
<i> the nation is obsessed</i>

1:13:32.634 --> 1:13:33.891

<i> to sherri papini.</i>

1:13:33.985 --> 1:13:34.892
<i> I gotta ask you,</i>

1:13:34.911 --> 1:13:36.727
What was the plan?

1:13:36.821 --> 1:13:38.162
I keep asking myself that.

1:13:40.975 --> 1:13:43.309
I really don't think
there was a plan.

1:13:43.402 --> 1:13:45.327
What did you think
was happening?

1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:49.315
I thought she was in
an abusive marriage.

1:13:49.333 --> 1:13:50.216
I thought her husband beat her.

1:13:55.506 --> 1:13:57.339
There's something
I need to tell you.

1:13:57.434 --> 1:14:00.685
There's no evidence that keith
or loretta ever beat sherri.

1:14:02.939 --> 1:14:06.348
There's only evidence
that she has a pattern of...

1:14:06.501 --> 1:14:07.859
Deceitful behavior.

1:14:09.946 --> 1:14:11.762
So it was all...

1:14:11.856 --> 1:14:12.697
It was all a lie?

1:14:14.842 --> 1:14:15.741
Most likely.

1:14:21.124 --> 1:14:21.864
You know,
the strangest thing is

1:14:22.016 --> 1:14:23.124
I'm not mad at her.

1:14:27.522 --> 1:14:28.421
I can't bring myself
to hate her.

1:14:30.467 --> 1:14:32.708
I know I should...

1:14:32.802 --> 1:14:34.260
But I still love her.

1:14:37.140 --> 1:14:39.865
I know she's mixed up.

1:14:39.884 --> 1:14:41.217
But I really wish

1:14:41.369 --> 1:14:44.103
She'd just allow herself
to get mixed up with me.

1:14:46.724 --> 1:14:47.707
Am I gonna be arrested?

1:14:47.725 --> 1:14:49.108
That is up to the d.A..

1:14:51.488 --> 1:14:54.046
But having a married woman
run away with you

1:14:54.065 --> 1:14:55.973
Is not illegal.

1:14:56.067 --> 1:14:57.325
It's just stupid?

1:15:00.997 --> 1:15:02.163
Yeah.

1:15:09.914 --> 1:15:11.339
[phone ringing]

1:15:13.510 --> 1:15:14.917

1:15:17.572 --> 1:15:18.513
Keith?

1:15:22.910 --> 1:15:24.018
That was the police.

1:15:24.245 --> 1:15:26.503
They sound excited.

1:15:26.523 --> 1:15:27.355
I think they found them.

1:15:35.681 --> 1:15:36.697
Yeah, yeah,
we'll be right there.

1:15:58.054 --> 1:15:59.387
Hello.

1:15:59.538 --> 1:16:00.680
Thank you.

1:16:04.135 --> 1:16:05.393
As you both know,

1:16:05.544 --> 1:16:08.062
This has been a long
and arduous investigation.

1:16:09.232 --> 1:16:10.731
But we are here today

1:16:10.958 --> 1:16:12.066
To share that we think
we have found the culprit.

1:16:13.294 --> 1:16:14.460
What?

1:16:14.478 --> 1:16:16.812
You found them?

1:16:16.906 --> 1:16:18.072
Who? Who did this to my wife?

1:16:20.484 --> 1:16:22.635
You recognize this man?

1:16:22.653 --> 1:16:23.911
No.

1:16:25.081 --> 1:16:29.141
No, I-- I told you that it...

1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:31.310
It was such a difficult time,
it's really hard to remember.

1:16:31.403 --> 1:16:33.070
Well, that's
interesting, sherri,

1:16:33.089 --> 1:16:35.906
Because we have an eyewitness

1:16:35.925 --> 1:16:38.926
That says they saw you
at this man, chris', apartment,

1:16:39.153 --> 1:16:40.011
When you were supposed
to be missing.

1:16:41.431 --> 1:16:43.580
Chris?

1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:45.766
Her ex-boyfriend, chris?

1:16:45.993 --> 1:16:47.250
He did this?

1:16:47.345 --> 1:16:48.177
Chris did this?

1:16:48.329 --> 1:16:51.347
Actually, keith, no.

1:16:51.441 --> 1:16:53.357
We have proof that she ran away
with him voluntarily.

1:16:55.169 --> 1:16:57.353
No.

1:16:57.505 --> 1:16:58.428
Then what happened, sherri?

1:16:58.448 --> 1:17:02.358
I don't know.

1:17:02.452 --> 1:17:03.509
It was such a difficult time.

1:17:03.527 --> 1:17:04.510
I don't remember.

1:17:04.528 --> 1:17:06.269
This wasn't a kidnapping.

1:17:06.289 --> 1:17:08.681
Chris thought that he was
in a romantic relationship

1:17:08.774 --> 1:17:09.874
With sherri
for the last six months.

1:17:11.202 --> 1:17:12.685
During that six months,

1:17:12.703 --> 1:17:14.854
They plotted,
spearheaded by sherri,

1:17:14.872 --> 1:17:16.213
In faking her kidnapping.

1:17:18.542 --> 1:17:19.634
Is this--
is this true?

1:17:21.696 --> 1:17:23.137
No. No.

1:17:24.623 --> 1:17:26.198
It was two women
that did this to me.

1:17:26.217 --> 1:17:28.200
It was two women.

1:17:28.293 --> 1:17:29.810
I found dna on your underwear

1:17:30.037 --> 1:17:31.103
That is a direct match
to chris'.

1:17:32.649 --> 1:17:33.814
How do you explain that?

1:17:33.966 --> 1:17:35.483
I don't know,

1:17:35.634 --> 1:17:37.801
But there's no way
that chris did this.

1:17:37.820 --> 1:17:39.879
There is no way.
There's no way.

1:17:39.897 --> 1:17:41.906
I spoke to chris.

1:17:44.568 --> 1:17:45.660
He admitted to everything.

1:17:47.905 --> 1:17:51.073
He also said that
you told him keith beat you.

1:17:51.167 --> 1:17:52.833
What?

1:17:56.063 --> 1:17:57.088
You said I beat you?

1:18:01.068 --> 1:18:02.343
Oh, my god.

1:18:06.090 --> 1:18:08.757
Sherri...

1:18:08.910 --> 1:18:09.767
Why?

1:18:14.765 --> 1:18:15.606
I need to speak to a lawyer.

1:18:17.843 --> 1:18:19.101
I'm sorry.

1:18:52.562 --> 1:18:54.544

1:18:54.564 --> 1:18:59.549
Mrs. Papini, not only
have you ruined your family,

1:18:59.569 --> 1:19:02.962
But your racist behavior
has damaged redding forever.

1:19:02.980 --> 1:19:05.656
You stole precious resources

We can go back to living
together peacefully.

1:22:54.971 --> 1:22:56.378
Thank you.

1:22:56.472 --> 1:22:57.304
No further questions.

1:23:19.720 --> 1:23:21.311
Don't say anything
that could get you into trouble.

1:23:21.405 --> 1:23:22.329
I know exactly what to say.

1:23:25.075 --> 1:23:27.075
-Sherri, did you do it?
-Sherri, why did you do it?

1:23:27.228 --> 1:23:28.502
What about your family?

1:23:28.653 --> 1:23:29.745
What about your community?

1:23:29.897 --> 1:23:31.246
Back off.

1:23:31.340 --> 1:23:32.748
Sherri! Sherri!
Is it true that you faked it?

1:23:32.842 --> 1:23:34.174
All of it?

1:23:36.012 --> 1:23:39.680
You've seen much dishonor
laid before you in this room.

1:23:41.350 --> 1:23:44.593
People who...

1:23:44.687 --> 1:23:49.672
Are not willing to...

1:23:49.767 --> 1:23:51.266
To walk through the shame,

1:23:51.418 --> 1:23:53.318
To say that they are guilty.

1:23:56.607 --> 1:23:57.614
I'm not one of them.

1:24:00.036 --> 1:24:01.952
I am guilty of lying.

1:24:05.374 --> 1:24:06.874
I am guilty of dishonor.

1:24:10.880 --> 1:24:14.106
I stand before you

1:24:14.199 --> 1:24:18.960
Willing to accept, repent,
and concede.

1:24:19.055 --> 1:24:21.780
I trust in this court.

1:24:21.799 --> 1:24:24.207
I trust in the...

1:24:24.226 --> 1:24:25.517
Officers handling my release.

1:24:28.455 --> 1:24:31.398
And I trust in you,
your honor,

1:24:31.550 --> 1:24:35.477
To see me,

1:24:35.629 --> 1:24:37.312
And hear me.

1:24:37.464 --> 1:24:41.983
I am choosing to...

1:24:42.136 --> 1:24:44.060
To not stay frozen,

1:24:44.154 --> 1:24:45.746
Like I was in 2016.

1:24:47.991 --> 1:24:51.568
I am committed...

1:24:51.587 --> 1:24:53.495
To healing
the parts of myself

1:24:53.647 --> 1:24:56.924
That were so very...

1:24:57.151 --> 1:24:58.425
Broken.

1:25:01.430 --> 1:25:03.672
And...

1:25:03.824 --> 1:25:07.659
To humbly accept...

1:25:07.678 --> 1:25:08.936
Responsibility.

1:25:11.089 --> 1:25:13.348
Sherri papini.

1:25:13.442 --> 1:25:15.834
I am sentencing you
to 18 months in prison

1:25:15.927 --> 1:25:17.260
And 36 months
supervised probation

1:25:17.279 --> 1:25:18.403
Upon release.

1:25:19.615 --> 1:25:20.839
You are ordered to pay

1:25:20.932 --> 1:25:22.449
More than $300,000
in restitution.

1:25:24.436 --> 1:25:26.269
You would probably still
be telling lies

1:25:26.363 --> 1:25:27.704
If you hadn't been caught.

1:25:29.533 --> 1:25:31.375
You can begin serving
your sentence in three months.

1:25:43.030 --> 1:25:45.055
So, what comes to mind?

1:25:47.125 --> 1:25:48.625
I've always wanted
to go to therapy.

1:25:48.719 --> 1:25:50.561
Then it's good you're here.

1:25:54.224 --> 1:25:55.632
This can't be
an easy time for you.

1:25:55.726 --> 1:25:58.059
You've lost your reputation,

1:25:58.154 --> 1:26:00.154
Your marriage,

1:26:00.305 --> 1:26:01.738
Your children.

1:26:03.550 --> 1:26:05.075
How do you feel about
your actions, sherri?

1:26:09.890 --> 1:26:11.456
God doesn't give you
more than you can handle.

1:26:23.495 --> 1:26:27.347
