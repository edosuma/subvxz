00:05.380 --> 00:09.050
HECTOR: Half a century, Molly,
since I swore allegiance
to king and country.

00:09.133 --> 00:12.637
We went into the army
as boys, green, callow.

00:12.720 --> 00:15.390
Came out men,
bold and bloodied.

00:15.473 --> 00:19.769
And now the regiment reunites,
just as we vowed,
fifty years to the day.

00:19.852 --> 00:23.398
The old squad, all together
again for the first
time since the war.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.274
-How many are coming?
-Six.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.610
-Six?
-What happened to the rest?

00:27.694 --> 00:29.570
Eight were untraceable,

00:29.654 --> 00:32.406
one's living with a costume
designer in Perth, calls
himself Judith.

00:32.490 --> 00:36.119
-Another's missing in Acton.
-Shouldn't that be action?

00:36.202 --> 00:38.538
No, Acton. Suburb of London.

00:38.621 --> 00:41.833
Five have moved overseas,
two have joined
religious orders,

00:41.916 --> 00:44.836
six haven't responded
and eleven are
no longer with us.

00:44.919 --> 00:47.547
What about Toad?
He hasn't croaked, has he?

00:47.630 --> 00:49.674
Hope not. Hasn't RSVPed.

00:49.757 --> 00:53.011
-Toad?
-Best man at our wedding.
You'd like him, Archie.

00:53.094 --> 00:56.973
-They're coming up the drive.
-This is it! Places, everyone.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.644
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

01:07.942 --> 01:11.487
I was captain to
a fine body of soldiers,
you know, Archie.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.365
Lean, keen and mean
when we had to be.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.752
(COUGHING)

01:28.212 --> 01:31.758
There, did you ever see
a more splendid sight?

02:10.336 --> 02:13.049
May I have a moment, everyone?

02:13.132 --> 02:15.968
Um, this is Mr Chris McCullen,

02:16.052 --> 02:21.265
the owner of what is
undoubtedly the centrepiece
of this exhibition.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.434
Well, for 24 hours anyway.

02:23.518 --> 02:26.145
-Er, Mr McCullen.
-Thank you.

02:26.229 --> 02:29.899
(APPLAUSE)

02:29.982 --> 02:34.237
The Proud Piper is a tribute
to the courage of yourselves

02:34.320 --> 02:36.572
and your fellow
old Caledonians.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.199
ALL: Hear, hear.

02:38.282 --> 02:41.493
And since the 1970
disbandment, I am .

02:41.577 --> 02:45.456
honoured that it has been in
the possession of my family.

02:45.540 --> 02:50.211
And you should be
equally honoured
to have it here today.

02:50.294 --> 02:54.757
Ladies and gentlemen,
the regimental mascot,
The Proud Piper.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.930
Ah, splendid, bravo.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.683
The Proud Piper.

03:03.766 --> 03:06.602
ALL: The Proud Piper.

03:10.189 --> 03:12.567
Look at him,
happy as a sandboy.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.445
And the painting,
well, that really is
the icing on the cake.

03:15.528 --> 03:18.072
It's just a shame
we can't keep it
for longer than a day.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.241
I mean,
you'd think for Â£500...

03:20.324 --> 03:23.369
We're lucky to
have got Mr McCullen
to hire it to us at all.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.122
It's been in exhibitions
all over the world,

03:26.205 --> 03:29.709
as he will tell you at
great length if you let him.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.962
-Look out.
-Can I offer you a refill?

03:33.046 --> 03:35.757
I think I'll pass.
Not quite what I'm used to.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.508
George,
this is my boy, Archie.

03:37.592 --> 03:40.678
-How do you do?
-It's a real pleasure.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.013
This is Stella.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.848
-Hi.
-Hello.

03:43.931 --> 03:46.100
And how long have
you two been together?

03:46.184 --> 03:50.188
Oh, no, we're not...
Well, we are,
but...not as a couple.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.607
I'm the estate's
financial controller.

03:52.690 --> 03:57.320
-Oh, handed over the baton,
eh, Hector?
-Something like that, yeah.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.655
And all's going swimmingly,
I take it?

03:59.739 --> 04:02.867
Started to.
We even made
a small profit last month.

04:02.950 --> 04:05.453
Oh, not just
a pretty face then, eh?

04:05.536 --> 04:07.372
(GEORGE LAUGHING)

04:07.455 --> 04:11.042
Well, I'm sure
the future's in safe hands.
What do you say, Hector?

04:11.125 --> 04:13.586
To Stella and Archie.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.255
-What is it, darling?
-Any news on Toad?

04:16.339 --> 04:20.426
No. I had hoped that
the Hero of Halfway Hill
would be with us, but...

04:20.510 --> 04:22.178
I hope nothing's
happened to him.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.198
Oh, excellent vintage, George.

04:42.281 --> 04:44.826
Good. There's stacks
more in the Bentley.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.119
(CHUCKLING)

04:46.202 --> 04:48.663
Now then, what have
we got to go with it?

04:48.746 --> 04:51.958
I hope you haven't
put the cookhouse
to too much trouble, Hector.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.169
Corned beef hash and cabbage.
What do you think about that?

04:55.253 --> 04:58.297
-What's this, then?
-Oh, I don't believe it.

04:58.381 --> 05:01.092
See, I told you
they wouldn't like it.

05:01.175 --> 05:04.345
Well, just wait till tomorrow.
A real treat for youse.
Spam fritters.

05:04.428 --> 05:07.640
(ALL GROANING)

05:07.724 --> 05:10.518
It's a taste of the old days.
I thought that was
what we were here for.

05:10.601 --> 05:13.563
If only. But the digestion's
not what it was.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.733
I've organised all the menus.
I mean, an army
marches on its stomach.

05:16.816 --> 05:21.779
And what did you always used
to say? A successful plan
is a flexible plan?

05:21.863 --> 05:23.614
It'll mean getting
in fresh supplies.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.242
-I'll see what I can arrange.
-Good man, Archie.

05:26.325 --> 05:28.870
And don't spare the expense.
We can all chip in.

05:28.953 --> 05:32.165
-ALL: Yeah.
-Aren't you going to eat
something before you go?

05:32.248 --> 05:35.710
Um, actually I don't
think I will, no. Um...

05:35.793 --> 05:38.671
But then that's all
the more for you, isn't it?

05:50.683 --> 05:55.396
You could see it today.
People take to
Archie very quickly.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.358
-That's a rare quality.
-Is that right?

06:01.152 --> 06:04.072
-Well, in business, I mean.
-Of course.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.075
-LEXIE: Hiya.
-All right?

06:07.158 --> 06:10.078
-We were just
talking about you.
-Oh, all good, I hope.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.872
-I need the chequebook.
-What for?

06:12.955 --> 06:14.832
Bit of a change on the
catering front, I'm afraid.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.126
Less corned beef,
more cordon bleu.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.462
Thought I'd pop into town
and see what I can pick up.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.714
Oh, don't worry, we're
not footing the whole bill.

06:21.798 --> 06:26.469
Well, in that case,
why don't I come with you?
Two heads are better than one.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.389
-Yeah, okay.
-Well,
why don't I come with you?

06:29.472 --> 06:31.391
Well, it doesn't
need all three of us.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.185
-And I am paying for it.
-Who'll be doing the cooking?

06:34.268 --> 06:37.021
I tell you what,
why don't you two
just go together?

06:37.105 --> 06:39.273
There's plenty I
can be doing here.

06:49.575 --> 06:52.328
Now then,
listen up, listen up, chaps.

06:52.412 --> 06:56.332
Now I know you won't all
want to be sitting
around all day, eh?

06:56.416 --> 06:58.876
Ah, Golly, tell them
about the facilities.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.712
Do you have a sauna?

07:00.795 --> 07:03.006
-Sorry?
-A sauna.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.758
-Er, afraid not.
-Oh, I couldn't
manage without mine.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.552
A Jacuzzi?

07:07.635 --> 07:10.430
We're more a kind of
outdoor
activities sort of style.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.016
Shooting,
fishing, hill walking.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.977
I could take you out on
the loch or give you
a tour of the estate.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.939
-Aha. Well,
there's no doubt in my mind.
-Yes, George?

07:20.023 --> 07:24.027
A brandy, a cigar and
a good long think about it.
Come on, lads.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.615
-Golly?
-Yes, boss.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.453
-Stand easy.
-Thanks, boss.

07:37.999 --> 07:44.505
So how long do you
think you've got left then,
you know, before you move on?

07:44.589 --> 07:49.761
-Are you trying
to get rid of me?
-No, no. I just wondered.

07:49.844 --> 07:54.015
Well, realistically,
I could be gone in
a couple of weeks.

07:54.098 --> 07:57.560
Although I'd like to stay
as long as Archie
feels he needs me.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.899
Oh, he'll be lucky
to get a lift out
here. Pull over.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.859
You're joking.
He could be anyone.

08:04.942 --> 08:09.030
And he might be
stranded with a very long wait
to the next bus. Pull over.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.039
-Now what are
the chances of that happening?
-What?

08:18.122 --> 08:22.502
Me being offered a lift by
two of the prettiest girls
in the whole of the Highlands.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.338
Well,
don't get too carried away.
It depends where you're going.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.548
But we can at least point you
in the right direction.

08:27.632 --> 08:31.844
Oh, proper couple of angels,
you are. Do you know
the Glenbogle estate?

08:33.136 --> 08:34.554
It's your lucky day.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.140
Ah, I hope so, lass.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.642
(CHUCKLES)

08:48.695 --> 08:50.655
Is he all right, George?

08:52.073 --> 08:54.450
Yeah, he's sure to be.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.576
(SNORING)

08:57.369 --> 09:01.874
There you are, you see.
Rather partial to
an afternoon nap myself.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.877
At least he's still with us.

09:04.961 --> 09:08.798
Which reminds me,
let's raise our
glasses to those who aren't.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.467
Our comrades who
fell alongside us

09:11.551 --> 09:14.929
and those chums
who came through it
but can't be with us today.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.348
-Absent friends.
-ALL: Absent friends.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.642
-Wherever they may be.
-ALL: Hear, hear.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.853
I can tell you
where one of them is.

09:21.936 --> 09:25.148
-Oh, it's Toad!
-GEORGE: Toad.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.191
Who else?

09:27.275 --> 09:29.819
Toadie! I can't
believe it. You got here.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.698
-Did you ever doubt it?
-Well done, old son.

09:36.159 --> 09:39.203
-Is that the lot?
-Yep, I think so.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.289
What about that one?

09:42.623 --> 09:44.167
Careful!

-This must be your daughter.
-Oh,
stop it and give me a hug.

10:01.309 --> 10:04.854
I knew you wouldn't miss an
opportunity to meet up with
your old friends.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.231
Oh, never mind about them.
It's you I've come to see.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.902
-Ah, Lexie, have you met...
-Er, yeah, yeah, we have. Hi.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.327
Oh, dear. Someone
ought to fetch Archie.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.121
Someone already has.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.374
-How did this happen?
-It was an accident.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.959
We were just
trying to get cleared up
as quickly as possible.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.586
I don't think Lexie
even realised...

10:28.670 --> 10:30.254
Are you trying to
say it was my fault?

10:30.338 --> 10:32.006
It's what Mr
McCullen says that matters.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.676
This is Â£20,000
worth of painting, .

10:34.759 --> 10:37.679
as he was at great pains to
mention to me more than once.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.472
Can you do
anything with it, Molly?

10:39.555 --> 10:43.434
Well, I'll try.
Archie, you'd better
take it up to my studio.

10:43.518 --> 10:46.521
I'll need some scissors, tape
and some strong adhesive.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.899
-Anything else?
-A miracle if
you can arrange it.

10:52.402 --> 10:56.114
ARCHIE: Well,
hopefully, we're insured.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.825
That was our silver wedding.
I wish you could
have been there.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.993
Oh, not half as much as I do.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.579
Oh, Molly's looking
as pretty as ever.

11:03.663 --> 11:08.626
Yeah, she seems happy, too,
so you must be doing
something right, you old dog.

11:08.710 --> 11:12.839
One tries one's best.
What about you? Did you
ever take the long walk?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.465
-Huh?
-Up the aisle.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.718
Ah, yes. Planning to.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.346
Catherine.
Yeah, that's her name.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.515
Oh, delightful.
You must bring her
up with you next time.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.976
-Oh, no. No can do.
-No, you must.
We'd be delighted.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.145
No, she's pretty much
of a one-off, I'm afraid.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.105
It was important
that I saw you, .

11:29.188 --> 11:32.525
but the fact is, I shouldn't
even be in the country.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.193
-Hay fever?
-No, no, no.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.863
No, I meant country as
in this great nation.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.866
Yes, officially I'm,
er, I'm on the lam.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.784
Nothing to be
ashamed of.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.578
Personally, I've no truck
with all this vegetarian
nonsense.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.997
No. No,
no, no. No, I did a runner.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.458
-Runner?
-Yeah, went over the wall.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.626
-Whose wall?
-Her Majesty's.

LEXIE: Better.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.219
You can still see it.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.472
Only if you look very closely.

12:02.555 --> 12:07.268
But that's what you do with
paintings. Archie does know
what he's talking about.

No, I always had a knack
with the old explosives.

12:25.787 --> 12:29.165
So when we all went
our separate ways,

12:29.248 --> 12:32.126

put my talents to good use.

-Safe-breaking.

-Er, precious stones mainly.
-Good Lord.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.634
Yeah,
but it's a young man's game.

12:39.717 --> 12:45.556
Eventually I got caught, but
not before I'd salted away
enough for my retirement.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.393
So I dug in and did my time.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.521
Took it on the chin,
I'll wager. Wouldn't have
expected anything less.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.523
That wasn't enough for
the Old Bill, though.

12:53.606 --> 12:58.528
Almost as soon as I got out,
I got framed for
a job that wasn't mine.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.988
Yeah, ended up with
another ten years.

13:01.072 --> 13:04.951
But I made my break in '89,
still with
eight left to serve.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.495
-Where have you
been hiding out?
-Marbella.

13:07.578 --> 13:11.666
Yes, I've got a lot of friends
out there. And now,
of course, there's, um, er...

13:11.749 --> 13:14.168
-Catherine.
-Er, yeah, that's the fella.

13:14.252 --> 13:17.338
Er, this is the first
time I've been back.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.508
You know, it wasn't easy,
but I couldn't let
the old team down.

13:20.591 --> 13:23.094
-Especially you, Captain.
-Heck of a chance
to take, Toadie.

13:23.177 --> 13:27.306
Well, you know,
I've always remembered
our pact to meet up.

13:27.390 --> 13:31.644
And, you know,
there are things that...
That need to be said.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.522
-Last goodbyes, you mean?
-Er, well, partly.

13:34.605 --> 13:39.318
-But what if you get caught?
-Well,
who's going to know I'm here?

13:39.402 --> 13:42.405
Welcome to Glenbogle,
historical home of
the clan MacDonald,

13:42.488 --> 13:47.076
with amenities now open to
the public, including our new
military exhibition,

13:47.160 --> 13:49.245
which will only be
with us for a short while.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.122
So if you'd like
to go straight on...

13:51.205 --> 13:53.207
Thanks, but we're not
here for sightseeing.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.793
We heard a long-lost
friend was in the area.

13:55.877 --> 14:01.341
Ah, it'll be the reunion,
then. The old soldiers,
they're having a get-together.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.593
Worth checking out. Got to be.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.762
Well, if you're
going that way anyway,

14:05.845 --> 14:09.390
I could do you
a deal on the tickets.
Let's say, half price?

14:09.474 --> 14:16.230
Thanks, but when you've got
one of these, you don't pay to
get in anywhere.

14:16.314 --> 14:19.359
This is Toad.
A more courageous man
you'll never meet.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.027
Oh, please.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.237
You wouldn't believe
what he's gone
through to get here.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.366
I don't think we need to bore
everyone with the details.
Suffice it to say, I'm here.

14:26.449 --> 14:29.994
And never has Glenbogle
had a more welcome guest.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.621
Pulled me out
of many a scrape.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.332
-Well, haven't we all?
-Quite.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.543
Well, Toad, whatever you want,
please, just treat
this place like home.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.337
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

14:39.420 --> 14:42.298
Sorry to interrupt,
but Duncan's on
his way up the drive

14:42.382 --> 14:46.803
with a couple of fellas
that have the definite
look of the law about them.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.430
Oh, Mother,
not more parking fines.

14:53.101 --> 14:56.354
-It must be
a really interesting job.
-It brings its own rewards.

14:56.437 --> 14:59.399
Like getting to
drive as fast as you can?

14:59.482 --> 15:02.193
I thought about
joining the force myself,
you know, when I was younger.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.904
-So what stopped you?
-My mother.

15:04.987 --> 15:09.283
She said there was already
enough disgrace in the family.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.620
Ah, here's our man.
Archie, this is...

15:12.704 --> 15:16.791
DS Grundy and DC West.
National Crime Squad.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.459
They're with the police.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.003
Yes, thank you, Duncan.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.923
Well, if there's anything
else you need, just ask.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.883
We'll, er, bear it in mind.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.468
So what can I do for you?

15:27.552 --> 15:30.888
This man, have you seen him?

15:30.972 --> 15:35.143
Real name Terry McLean,
aka Toadie McIntyre,
aka Terry the Toff.

15:35.226 --> 15:38.980
Notorious jewel
thief in his day.

15:39.063 --> 15:42.525
Ugly boot, isn't he? Sorry,
can't help you. Can we?

15:42.608 --> 15:43.693
No.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.781
This is my father.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.950
Why don't you
have a proper look?

15:53.202 --> 15:56.039
We are open to the public.
We get a lot of people
wandering around here.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.623
But definitely not him.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.917
He's in the area and he's
certainly not camera shy.

16:00.001 --> 16:03.504
They caught him on video at
Edinburgh Airport and again at
Inverness station.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.631
Well, that doesn't
mean he's here, though,
does it?

16:05.715 --> 16:09.302
He's also ex-army. If you've
got some sort of reunion
going on, it's possible.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.472
-It's just a coincidence.
Isn't it?
-Yes.

16:12.555 --> 16:15.350
So you won't mind if
we have a wander round?

16:15.433 --> 16:17.352
I could show you
around if you like.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.437
Why don't you do that?

16:30.073 --> 16:32.533
And thanks for your support,
by the way.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.494
How do you mean?

16:34.577 --> 16:37.705
Trying to stir things up with
Archie about what happened
with the painting.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.333
-I was just
telling it like it was.
-Oh, please.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.710
You must think my
mother knitted me.

16:42.794 --> 16:46.172
-What are you talking about?
-The way you keep
trying to put me down.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.091
I mean,
you should hear yourself.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.635
"Archie knows what
he's talking about,"

16:50.718 --> 16:53.388
and, "I'll be here
for as long as he
feels he needs me."

16:53.471 --> 16:55.515
That doesn't mean anything.

16:55.598 --> 16:58.643
It means you fancy
him something rotten.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.982
See? I'm right, amn't I?

17:06.776 --> 17:10.363
What's the matter, Lex?
Afraid of
a little competition?

17:15.201 --> 17:18.997
-I simply cannot
allow you in there.
-And why would that be?

17:19.079 --> 17:20.832
(TOILET FLUSHING)

17:24.794 --> 17:27.005
Oh, sorry, didn't
realise there was a queue.

17:27.088 --> 17:29.340
Well,
you could have just said.

17:37.098 --> 17:38.641
All clear.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.869
DUNCAN:
The dining room's this way.

18:01.372 --> 18:05.251
-So what's down here, then?
-The kitchen. Come on.

18:10.965 --> 18:14.886
Er, Duncan, Duncan.

18:14.969 --> 18:18.639
MOLLY: I'm sorry,
you've been this way before.
GRUNDY: I don't think so.

18:18.723 --> 18:21.142
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.938
What is going on?

18:26.022 --> 18:27.357
Toad's in a hole.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.150
He's hardly gonna
be in there, is he?

18:29.233 --> 18:31.694
What do you think
we've got him doing,
peeling potatoes?

18:31.778 --> 18:34.364
Let's just see, shall we?

18:37.992 --> 18:39.202
Right.

18:43.081 --> 18:46.042
You see, you have to get
as much air in as possible.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.294
I mean, that's the secret
of a very good meringue.

18:48.378 --> 18:51.464
HECTOR: What my
Baked Alaska sadly lacks.

18:53.174 --> 18:56.928
Oh.
Ah. Hello, chaps. Any luck?

18:59.389 --> 19:02.225
-Doesn't seem like it.
-Did try to tell you.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.477
Are you sure you
don't want to search
the whole estate?

19:04.560 --> 19:08.356
It's only 35,500 acres. If you
start now, you might be
finished by Tuesday.

19:08.439 --> 19:11.234
That won't be necessary.
Which is the quickest
way back to the car?

19:11.317 --> 19:12.860
Through here.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.287
Sorry to have
troubled you folks.

19:29.711 --> 19:30.878
(SIGHS)

19:30.962 --> 19:33.756
Okay?
Right, you can come out now.

19:37.427 --> 19:40.555
Well done, Lexie.
Toadie,
a small dram to celebrate?

19:40.638 --> 19:41.723
Oh, yes.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.183
Father,
I think we need a word.

19:46.269 --> 19:49.188
Toad, you're an outlaw.
How exciting!

19:49.272 --> 19:52.817
Did you ever meet Mr Big?
In the slammer, I mean.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.486
This isn't a movie, mother.

19:55.570 --> 19:58.489
-I'm sorry, Toad,
we'd like to help, but...
-And we will.

19:58.573 --> 20:00.491
You can stay as
long as you like.

20:00.575 --> 20:04.662
"MacDonald Family
Harbours Escaped Prisoner."
Now, how's that going to look?

20:04.746 --> 20:06.331
And what if he was
wrongly convicted?

20:06.414 --> 20:08.291
We've only got
his word for it.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.251
Toad wouldn't lie. Not to me.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.421
Well, the jury obviously
seemed to think differently.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.924
I'm sorry, if he gets caught
here, then we could all
end up behind bars.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.843
It wouldn't come to that.

20:18.926 --> 20:22.930
He's right. Do you
know what the penalty is
for hiding a fugitive, Hector?

20:23.014 --> 20:25.808
Just because you two
played soldiers together
does not mean to say...

20:25.892 --> 20:30.021
Young lady,
ours was a friendship
forged on a battlefield.

20:30.104 --> 20:33.441
Giving him up would be
like betraying a brother.
Can't you understand that?

20:33.524 --> 20:35.151
-It's all right, Captain.
-No, it's not.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.320
This all happened
a very long time ago.

20:37.403 --> 20:41.949
Yes, it did. But when
somebody saves your life,
you tend not to forget.

20:43.618 --> 20:45.787
-Is that true?
-It was in Korea.

20:45.870 --> 20:50.333
Our first taste of real
action. We were all terrified.

20:50.416 --> 20:54.629
A machine-gun post had pinned
us down. Could have wiped out
the whole regiment.

20:54.712 --> 20:58.466
Well, Toad volunteered to go
with me and try and
destroy the bally thing.

20:58.549 --> 21:02.136
All I managed to do was
get myself
knocked unconscious.

21:02.220 --> 21:05.473
Toad went on, alone,
and blew
the thing to smithereens.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.393
Then he carried me back.

21:08.476 --> 21:12.355
If he hadn't,
none of us would be
standing here today.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.779
He got the Military
Cross for his bravery.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.823
It's a debt of honour, Archie.

21:21.906 --> 21:23.700
Why didn't you tell
us any of this before?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.743
I didn't want
to talk about it.

21:25.827 --> 21:31.874
I was one of the lucky ones.
Lots of our chums
never came back.

21:31.958 --> 21:36.421
I can get him out first thing
in the morning. One night,
that's all I'm asking.

21:39.382 --> 21:43.261
-All right, one night.
-Oh, thank you.
Thank you both.

21:43.344 --> 21:45.930
We'll organise
four-hour watches.

21:46.014 --> 21:49.517
Nobody gets into Glenbogle
without my knowing it.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.026
WEST:
It could be a long night.

21:58.109 --> 22:01.195
Not for me. Camped
about all over the place
when I was in the Scouts.

22:01.279 --> 22:05.158
I wouldn't be too
quick to admit that
back at the station.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.618
Nothing to be ashamed of.

22:07.702 --> 22:11.080
And that old boy's
definitely hiding something.

22:14.292 --> 22:15.376
Hello.

22:20.256 --> 22:23.926
Now you tell me
there's nothing going on.

22:35.980 --> 22:39.067
-Thanks, by the way.
-What for?

22:39.150 --> 22:42.111
Not kicking up more
of a fuss about Toad.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.781
I know you don't think
the situation's ideal.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.742
Well, let's keep it
between ourselves then, eh?

22:47.825 --> 22:50.787
I don't want people to
think I'm going soft.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.414
Your secret's safe with me.

22:53.498 --> 22:57.085
In the meantime,
we have McCullen
coming in the morning.

22:57.168 --> 22:59.837
We start off by apologising,
obviously,

22:59.921 --> 23:04.842
eat a portion or two of
humble pie, and then hand it
straight to the insurers.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.972
-Except we're not covered.
-What?

23:10.056 --> 23:14.185
There's an exemption clause.
"For all
antiquities and works of art

23:14.268 --> 23:18.481
"which are not
the absolute and sole property
of the policy holder."

23:20.692 --> 23:22.193
You're joking.

23:28.157 --> 23:30.159
Mission accomplished.
Bacon or sausage?

23:31.077 --> 23:32.662
Surprise me.

23:34.956 --> 23:39.043
They checked all
the hotels within 20 miles.
Not a sniff.

23:39.127 --> 23:42.463
Then it's even more
likely that he's here.

23:42.547 --> 23:46.801
We got the main road covered.
No one need know
we're even about.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.429
Still here, then?

23:50.096 --> 23:51.848
Looks like it.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.058
You haven't caught
who you were after?

23:54.142 --> 23:57.353
We think we missed
him in the search.

23:57.437 --> 24:01.816
You know, what we need
is a man on the inside,

24:01.899 --> 24:03.860
with a ready eye
and a keen brain.

24:03.943 --> 24:07.989
Ideally, somebody who once
wanted to be
a policeman themselves.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.284
What would I have to do?

24:11.367 --> 24:14.704
We need to know just how many
men are here for that reunion
and who they are.

24:14.787 --> 24:19.125
Spy on Hector's friends?
Oh, I couldn't do that.
He's done a lot for me.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.461
-Now's your
chance to pay him back.
-How's that, then?

24:21.544 --> 24:25.256
There's a strong possibility
there's a dangerous
felon in their midst.

24:25.340 --> 24:28.092
A man with no conscience,
capable of doing real harm.

24:28.176 --> 24:31.929
But you could help catch him.
Now, it would mean
going deep undercover.

24:37.935 --> 24:41.356
-Police issue.
-You'll have
the cuffs on by lunch time.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.526
I'm sorry, Arch.

24:45.610 --> 24:48.654
(SIGHS) You're
not gonna hold it
against me, are you?

24:48.738 --> 24:51.491
No. No, no, of course not.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.330
Any thoughts?

24:57.413 --> 25:00.583
As far as I can see,
I still think our best
bet is to get it repaired.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.960
Professionally, I mean.

25:03.044 --> 25:05.672
There is another way possibly.

25:07.507 --> 25:10.093
You could accept
personal liability.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.011
Why don't I like
the sound of that?

25:12.095 --> 25:14.514
Then if McCullen does want to
make a claim,

25:14.597 --> 25:17.558
it would be against
you and not the estate.

25:17.642 --> 25:21.104
So I would end up paying?
No thanks.

25:21.187 --> 25:26.109
But you wouldn't, not unless
you've got a spare 20
grand kicking around.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.277
What do you reckon, Archie?

25:28.361 --> 25:32.448
Er, excuse me, don't I get a
say in this? What if I don't
wanna take the blame?

25:32.532 --> 25:36.953
No, I could never
ask you to do that.
We'll just have to come clean.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.330
It might not be as big
a disaster as we think.

25:39.414 --> 25:44.043
Wasn't that what
they kept saying
about the Millennium Dome?

25:44.127 --> 25:46.087
-All the best.
-Good luck, Toad.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.047
-Goodbye.
-Good luck.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.049
Good luck, old son.

25:50.133 --> 25:52.969
Right, let's get this
show on the road, shall we?

25:53.052 --> 25:56.055
Just missing one
piece of vital equipment.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.181
George.

25:59.767 --> 26:02.603
-Toad.
-Au revoir, dear lady.

26:02.687 --> 26:07.066
No, this time I think it's
goodbye. I do hope
everything works out.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.902
Look after the old boy,
won't you, hmm?

26:09.986 --> 26:11.696
Somebody's got to.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.497
What do you think?
Stroke of genius, what?

26:21.581 --> 26:26.586
That's what I like about you,
Captain. You always did know
how to travel in style.

26:35.636 --> 26:38.222
Got yourself
a new hobby, then?

26:38.306 --> 26:41.809
I just wanted
a memento of the occasion.

26:41.893 --> 26:43.519
Mmm.

26:52.820 --> 26:56.949
"Press button A to
open film chamber."

26:57.033 --> 27:00.495
Done that.
"Insert film cassette."

27:00.578 --> 27:02.830
HECTOR: Come on, chaps.

27:02.914 --> 27:07.335
DUNCAN: "Carrier left." Left.

27:08.836 --> 27:12.173
"Attach film end to B."

27:16.010 --> 27:19.097
Right. "And close chamber."

27:20.515 --> 27:22.809
(CAMERA WHIRRING)

27:23.935 --> 27:26.479
So far so good.

27:26.562 --> 27:29.982
"Turn C to advance film."
Easy-peasy.

27:31.109 --> 27:33.111
Right. Ready for you.

27:45.289 --> 27:47.333
Ah, Mr McCullen.
Just the man I wanted to see.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.002
Before you say
anything else,

27:49.085 --> 27:51.087
I'd like to know why I've been
treated like a
common criminal.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.798
-Sorry?
-The policemen who have
set up by your bridge,

27:53.881 --> 27:58.136
they've had my car turned
inside out. I told them who
I was, but would they listen?

27:58.219 --> 28:00.471
-Where's father?
-Just left.

28:03.641 --> 28:05.893
Coffee?

28:05.977 --> 28:10.273
And then if you all give me
your names and addresses,

28:10.356 --> 28:13.359
then I can send
you copies later.

28:18.823 --> 28:22.493
Oh. Or perhaps even one
with the laird himself.
I'm sure he wouldn't mind.

28:26.414 --> 28:28.916
Not right now,
though, obviously.

28:37.925 --> 28:40.803
Five-hour drive to Stranraer.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.430
Then I'll get you straight
onto the ferry

28:42.513 --> 28:44.557
and you can train it from
Dublin to Belfast.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.726
Then it should
be plain sailing.

28:46.809 --> 28:52.106
That's what I like about you,
Captain. You always were
the master of faultless plan.

28:52.190 --> 28:54.734
Once you've got it,
Toadie, you never lose it.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.194
(HORN HONKING)

28:56.277 --> 28:59.781
HECTOR: That's Archie.
What's he playing at?

29:04.452 --> 29:06.621
Father, pull off the road!

29:10.333 --> 29:12.919
HECTOR: Ah, splendid.
Well done, Archie.

29:13.002 --> 29:15.880
Classic diversionary tactic.

29:26.516 --> 29:28.142
(TYRES SCREECHING)

29:35.650 --> 29:37.568
-Hold it!
-Both of you!

29:39.320 --> 29:41.698
-What do you want?
-Shut it.

29:41.781 --> 29:45.243
Now I wonder what we
might have in here?

29:45.326 --> 29:48.538
-A gentleman's
laundry is his own business.
-Humour us.

29:48.621 --> 29:50.999
Sheets, shirts, socks
and assorted unmentionables.

29:51.082 --> 29:53.251
And you expect us to believe
you'd be doing
your own washing?

29:53.334 --> 29:55.211
Oh, my father's a
very modern man.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.963
That's right.
I'm a wizard with a mangle.

29:57.046 --> 30:00.466
We haven't got time for this.
Come on, out you get!

30:09.350 --> 30:12.729
-Is there anything
else we can help you with?
-You...

30:14.063 --> 30:16.566
Looks like
an open and shut case.

30:23.698 --> 30:25.616
I still think we
should wait for Archie.

30:25.700 --> 30:28.745
I've no time.
I have to get
The Piper properly packaged.

30:28.828 --> 30:32.123
I've got a gala
unveiling in Canada next week.

30:32.206 --> 30:35.752
So... Shall we?

30:37.253 --> 30:39.756
Well, the thing is, you see,

30:39.839 --> 30:45.678
you can't anticipate
every eventuality, can you?

30:45.762 --> 30:48.514
What exactly is it
you're talking about?

30:48.598 --> 30:51.225
STELLA: Lexie.

30:51.309 --> 30:54.896
Well, I don't think it needs
the both of us to tell him.
Do you?

30:58.900 --> 31:02.570
He's a wily old fox,
you've got to agree.

31:02.653 --> 31:07.658
-Toadie. Plan B, eh?
-Hold on a minute.

31:07.742 --> 31:10.828
I'm sorry, Toad, but I think
we've done all
we can do for you.

31:10.912 --> 31:15.124
Archie, if Toad gets caught,
he'll spend the rest
of his life in prison.

31:15.208 --> 31:17.543
-It's a risk...
-It's a risk that I'm
not prepared to take.

31:17.627 --> 31:19.629
There's police
all over the place.

31:19.712 --> 31:22.757
If you make Toad leave, I'm
going to walk down there and
give myself up with him.

31:22.840 --> 31:25.051
-Oh,
please, you don't mean that.
-Don't I?

31:25.134 --> 31:26.928
All right, Toadie, let's
face this together.

31:27.011 --> 31:29.889
No, wait, wait.
Archie's right.

31:29.972 --> 31:34.352
I've put your whole
family in jeopardy.
It was wrong of me.

31:34.435 --> 31:37.188
-I should never
have come back.
-Nonsense.

31:37.271 --> 31:41.484
-Have you forgotten
how much I owe you?
-That's just it.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.653
You don't owe me anything.

31:43.736 --> 31:45.863
You're too modest
for your own good,
that's your trouble.

31:45.947 --> 31:50.576
I'm no hero, Hector.
That's what I came
here to tell you.

31:50.660 --> 31:53.621
Well, call me old-fashioned,
but as far as I'm aware,

31:53.705 --> 31:56.249
they don't just hand out
Military Crosses willy-nilly.

31:56.332 --> 32:00.128
Will you let me finish?
It was a mistake.

32:01.921 --> 32:05.174
It should have been
pinned on your chest,
not mine.

32:05.258 --> 32:08.011
He's only saying this
to make you feel better,
I hope you realise that.

32:08.094 --> 32:13.391
I'm not the brave one.
If I was, I would have
come clean before now.

32:13.474 --> 32:15.768
Heaven knows I've
wanted to often enough.

32:15.852 --> 32:17.895
What are you talking about?

32:17.979 --> 32:21.232
It was you that
destroyed that machine gun.

32:22.233 --> 32:24.027
I don't understand.

32:24.902 --> 32:27.155
I was just decoy.

32:27.238 --> 32:31.659
You were the one
who got behind it
with the grenade.

32:31.743 --> 32:35.246
Oh,
I've never seen such mettle.

32:35.330 --> 32:38.583
I remember thinking,
"He can't get any nearer."

32:39.542 --> 32:41.377
But you did.

32:41.461 --> 32:44.756
In the end you got so
close that the blast
knocked you out

32:44.839 --> 32:47.258
and I had to
carry you back.

32:47.342 --> 32:49.761
I was so
worried you were dead.

32:49.844 --> 32:54.557
And I never got
the chance to tell you
what had actually happened.

32:54.640 --> 32:58.603
When you came round, of
course, well, you couldn't
remember a thing.

32:58.686 --> 33:00.938
And so, somehow or other...

33:02.440 --> 33:05.068
I ended up by
taking the credit.

33:06.027 --> 33:08.112
And the longer it went on,

33:08.196 --> 33:11.366
the harder it was to
own up to the truth.

33:12.408 --> 33:14.869
Because, you see,

33:14.952 --> 33:18.831
I rather enjoyed being
the Hero of Halfway Hill.

33:22.877 --> 33:26.881
No, I've no right to
ask anything of you.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.427
Will you turn yourself in?

33:31.511 --> 33:33.554
Er, not if I can help it.

33:33.638 --> 33:39.102
But if things get rough, well,
I'll just say I hid up here
without your knowledge.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.863
You've got my word.

34:03.543 --> 34:04.836
Father?

34:09.172 --> 34:12.092
Father?

34:12.176 --> 34:16.639
McCULLEN: For goodness sake!
What have you done
to this painting?

34:16.723 --> 34:19.225
GRUNDY: Well?
WEST: Nah, just tourists.

34:22.937 --> 34:26.315
So what now, guv?
Storm the castle?

34:26.399 --> 34:30.570
No. No,
no, no. We just sit tight.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.572
Their luck's gotta
run out sometime.

34:32.655 --> 34:36.199
-I've done it!
-What?

34:36.284 --> 34:40.788
What you asked me to.
There's six of them,
and I've got photographs.

34:40.871 --> 34:42.790
I knew you were
the man for the job.

34:42.873 --> 34:45.335
So, can we see them?
The pictures?

34:45.418 --> 34:48.504
Dropped them in
at the chemists.
Get 'em back Wednesday.

34:54.677 --> 34:56.137
I can't apologise enough.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.389
You can't do
anything if you ask me.

34:58.473 --> 35:01.476
This painting was
irreplaceable. You knew that.

35:01.559 --> 35:05.730
Did you,
um, have it insured at all?

35:05.813 --> 35:09.650
-Its monetary value
is of no consequence.
-So it was covered?

35:09.734 --> 35:13.071
-It's
the historical significance.
-Yes, of course, yes.

35:13.154 --> 35:16.115
It's just that you did,
you did mention Â£20,000.

35:16.199 --> 35:19.911
That's without loss of
earnings. It commands
substantial hire fees.

35:19.994 --> 35:23.289
Mr McCullen, we
accept full responsibility.

35:23.373 --> 35:25.541
I don't think you
have a lot of choice
in that regard.

35:25.625 --> 35:27.627
You ought to put in
a claim as soon as possible.

35:27.710 --> 35:32.173
The Piper was in your
possession, therefore it is
your responsibility.

35:35.385 --> 35:38.095
Well, the thing is,
we don't think we're covered.

35:38.179 --> 35:41.015
Oh, just how
incompetent are you people?

35:41.099 --> 35:44.018
I think it's time I
called my solicitor.

36:04.038 --> 36:05.747
I thought you'd gone.

36:05.832 --> 36:09.168
Slight change of plan.
Er, they're on a bus
trip from Edinburgh

36:09.252 --> 36:12.588
and off back in five minutes
so I thought I'd take
my chances with them.

36:12.672 --> 36:15.090
-You think you'll make it?
-Oh, it's my only hope.

36:15.174 --> 36:19.012
And the way I see it,
they're hard-pushed to
search every vehicle.

36:19.095 --> 36:22.431
So I'll keep my head
down and keep my cool, eh?

36:22.515 --> 36:26.477
-Well, all the best then, eh?
-Thanks for everything.

36:28.354 --> 36:30.732
Ah, what are you
putting on that easel?

36:30.815 --> 36:35.194
Well, it was supposed to be
for a painting, The Proud
Piper. Have you heard of it?

36:35.278 --> 36:38.698
Oh, of course I have.
Regimental mascot.
Symbol of good fortune.

36:38.781 --> 36:40.283
Not for me it wasn't.

36:40.366 --> 36:42.744
-I only wish I'd seen it.
-Bring yourself some luck?

36:42.827 --> 36:45.496
Well, I'd like to
take a closer look at it.

36:45.580 --> 36:48.958
Yes, it's said to be a...
A very impressive copy.

36:53.588 --> 36:55.965
Copy?

36:56.049 --> 36:58.092
Look, I'm gonna have
to be frank with you,

36:58.176 --> 37:00.928
I don't think the estate can
come up with that kind
of cash. It could ruin us.

37:01.012 --> 37:03.473
Oh, please,
you'll have me in tears.

37:03.556 --> 37:05.850
The bottom line is,
we all have a living to make.

37:05.933 --> 37:07.935
Yes,
but perhaps we could come to
some sort of arrangement.

37:08.019 --> 37:09.604
I'm not interested.

37:09.687 --> 37:15.568
-The Proud Piper
was one of the last...
-Was destroyed in 1935.

37:15.651 --> 37:17.945
So what's this, then?
A figment of my imagination?

37:18.029 --> 37:19.447
A reproduction.

37:19.530 --> 37:21.616
Which you, no doubt, well know

37:21.699 --> 37:26.537
because your grandfather was
one of those men who conspired
to have that copy made.

37:26.621 --> 37:28.164
I resent that.

37:28.247 --> 37:31.042
And I resent someone
who's never
even worn a uniform

37:31.125 --> 37:34.087
profiteering from
the regiment like that.

37:34.170 --> 37:39.425
Not only are you insulting the
memory of the old Cals, you're
ripping off my friends.

37:39.509 --> 37:41.386
I think I know more
about art than you do.

37:41.469 --> 37:45.807
Ah, maybe,
but I've studied every detail
of the history of my regiment,

37:45.890 --> 37:48.434
and you're peddling a fake.

37:48.518 --> 37:50.228
-Prove it.
-Lexie.

37:56.317 --> 37:57.777
His cuff.

38:00.488 --> 38:02.490
You have to look closely.

38:02.573 --> 38:05.410
Well, that's what
you do with paintings.

38:05.493 --> 38:10.581
TOAD: The artist has
left us a wee clue.
Three red buttons

38:11.833 --> 38:14.043
which were not
introduced to the uniform

38:14.127 --> 38:19.048
until 150 years after
the original Proud
Piper was painted.

38:20.842 --> 38:23.886
Â£20,000 you say it's worth?

38:23.970 --> 38:27.181
Yeah, I reckon two
at the absolute most.

38:32.311 --> 38:36.566
-You haven't heard
the last of this.
-Oh, I think we probably have.

38:37.859 --> 38:39.527
(VEHICLE HONKING)

38:39.610 --> 38:42.572
Oh, the coach.
You've missed it.

38:42.655 --> 38:45.491
Yes, I know.
Anyway, it was a long shot.

38:45.575 --> 38:47.577
What are you gonna do?
The roads'll all be blocked.

38:47.660 --> 38:50.204
-You can't get out on foot.
-Have to be surrender.

38:50.288 --> 38:52.915
You can't go to jail again,
not for
something you didn't do.

38:52.999 --> 38:55.251
-You could always appeal.
-Takes years.

38:55.335 --> 38:58.796
Well, what about Catherine?
And... And your retirement?

38:58.880 --> 39:03.259
A nice dream, but
obviously not meant to be.

39:03.343 --> 39:07.138
Well, we'll just have to
dream up a fiendishly
inventive escape plan.

39:07.221 --> 39:10.516
-Which is where
my father comes in.
-Hector?

39:14.896 --> 39:16.939
Father, I've changed my mind.

39:17.023 --> 39:20.526
I think with our help,
Toad can still make
it back to Marbella.

39:20.610 --> 39:26.449
I won't pretend it's gonna be
easy but, I think it's worth a
shot if we all pull together.

39:30.870 --> 39:34.624
I understand.
He doesn't want to know.

39:35.750 --> 39:38.169
And I don't blame him.

39:38.252 --> 39:41.297
Did I say dismiss?

39:41.381 --> 39:45.385
I don't like deceit,
I don't like deception.
Never have, never will.

39:45.468 --> 39:48.012
But I never turned my
back on an old comrade,

39:48.096 --> 39:51.432
especially one who's
as dear to me as you.

39:53.309 --> 39:55.395
Thank you, Captain.

39:55.478 --> 40:00.358
Well, don't just stand there,
round up the troops.
There are plans to be laid.

40:02.944 --> 40:05.905
-Well done, Archie.
-Oh, I think it's
the least we owe him.

40:05.988 --> 40:09.325
Getting him out's going to
be difficult. The net is
tightening as we speak.

40:09.409 --> 40:14.497
Mmm, I know. But it's not
beyond the wit of a war hero
to think of something.

40:21.546 --> 40:23.923
They were down
there yesterday.

40:27.468 --> 40:29.220
Well, they're not there now.

40:31.848 --> 40:35.143
Wait a minute.
Out of my way. Out.

40:38.771 --> 40:40.356
There they are.

40:42.775 --> 40:46.279
DUNCAN: I still don't
understand. They are
the police, aren't they?

40:46.362 --> 40:48.406
That's what they are, Duncan.

40:48.489 --> 40:52.201
-And I was doing right
to offer to help them?
-Definitely.

40:52.285 --> 40:56.622
-But I'm not to any more?
-Now you're catching on, son.

40:56.706 --> 40:59.208
Right.

40:59.292 --> 41:01.878
DUNCAN:
Couldn't we get into trouble
for this, though?

41:01.961 --> 41:05.256
Well, it's beginning to look
like a distinct possibility.

41:07.300 --> 41:08.760
What's all this
about, Mr McCullen?

41:08.843 --> 41:10.845
It's this
escaped-prisoner fella.

41:10.928 --> 41:13.181
-He's in the house.
-Are you sure?

41:13.264 --> 41:15.224
I was speaking
to him yesterday.

41:16.059 --> 41:18.102
Get on the radio.

41:18.186 --> 41:22.440
We want as many men here
as we can. He's not slipping
through my fingers now.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.942
Duncan and Golly are
here at the bridge.

41:25.026 --> 41:28.571
Er, Lexie, you'll be
with Stella on the old road.

41:28.654 --> 41:30.406
Amn't I the lucky one?

41:30.490 --> 41:34.077
Now, the success of
this whole mission
relies on split-second timing.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.204
Does everybody know
what they've got to do?

41:36.287 --> 41:40.166
-Absolutely.
I wait at the north gate.
-And we're all up for it?

41:40.249 --> 41:42.168
Wouldn't miss an adventure
like this for the world.

41:42.251 --> 41:45.505
Well said, George. Now,
Archie, transport laid on?

41:45.588 --> 41:47.965
I've had to call
in a few favours,
but yes, it's all arranged.

41:48.049 --> 41:50.843
Good boy.
Golly, what's the news
from the front line?

41:50.927 --> 41:53.763
We'd better get a move on.
They're calling
for reinforcements.

41:53.846 --> 41:57.725
Right, this is it. Good luck,
chaps. Let's all try and
come back in one piece.

41:57.809 --> 42:00.728
-Well,
I shan't forget this, Archie.
-No, nor will I.

42:00.812 --> 42:04.732
And if it all goes well,
I'll send you
a piece of wedding cake.

42:04.816 --> 42:06.609
If you do decide
to get hitched up,

42:06.693 --> 42:08.653
you'd better come
and have your
honeymoon with us.

42:08.736 --> 42:11.739
ARCHIE: Nice idea, Toad,
but don't hold your breath.

42:11.823 --> 42:16.661
I don't think
you'll have to look
too far for the right woman.

42:16.744 --> 42:18.830
That's
the least of my worries.

42:18.913 --> 42:21.416
Now, Golly, are you sure that
Duncan knows what's at stake?

42:21.499 --> 42:23.960
Well, I've made it
as clear as I can.

42:24.043 --> 42:27.130
I told you we should
have sent someone else.

42:31.968 --> 42:33.761
What's going on here, then?

42:33.845 --> 42:36.347
-You were supposed
to be telling us that.
-Not that it matters any more.

42:36.431 --> 42:39.183
We've found out
all we need to know,
thanks to Mr McCullen here.

42:39.267 --> 42:41.394
Yes, sonny, if you just...

42:43.021 --> 42:46.357
DUNCAN: You won't be
wanting my information, then?

42:47.984 --> 42:51.696
Oh, one of the old soldier
fellas from the castle,

42:51.779 --> 42:56.325
he asked me, "Is there
a way of leaving the estate
without being seen?"

42:57.076 --> 42:58.703
What did you tell him?

42:58.786 --> 43:01.914
I said, "That'll be tricky,
with what you're wearing."

43:01.998 --> 43:04.917
-And what was that?
-A bright yellow cagoule.

43:05.001 --> 43:08.087
But he didn't say when
he'd be making his break?

43:08.171 --> 43:10.840
Oh, soon. Definitely.

43:13.593 --> 43:15.094
(WHISPERING)

43:27.523 --> 43:30.443
-ARCHIE: There's the signal.
-Ready, George?

43:30.526 --> 43:34.072
-Just you try and stop me.
-Go, number one.

43:39.577 --> 43:43.373
-Everyone's in position.
-Right, let's start moving in.

43:43.456 --> 43:46.501
Wait, cancel that.
There he is.

43:46.584 --> 43:49.337
The hare is on the move.
Repeat,
the hare is on the move

43:49.420 --> 43:50.797
and coming your way,
Delta Team.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.507
Go, number two.

43:54.008 --> 43:56.552
Hang on a minute,
there's another.

43:56.636 --> 44:00.556
-And another.
-WEST: What do you wanna do?

44:00.640 --> 44:03.559
Get 'em all grabbed.
One of them's
gotta be our man.

44:03.643 --> 44:07.105
West to Alpha and Delta.
West to Alpha and Delta.

44:07.188 --> 44:08.606
All are to be detained.

44:08.690 --> 44:11.734
Repeat,
all are to be detained.

44:11.818 --> 44:16.197
Excuse me. Excuse me.

44:16.280 --> 44:22.328
I hate to worry you, but
there's a very suspicious man
in the field over there.

44:22.412 --> 44:26.207
You can't miss him,
he's wearing
a yellow anorak thingy.

44:33.923 --> 44:38.511
-I can manage this
by myself, you know.
-I'll do my bit.

44:38.594 --> 44:42.223
What, think it'll earn
you some Brownie points
from Archie?

44:42.306 --> 44:45.727
Just remember,
I've been here
a lot longer than you.

44:45.810 --> 44:47.311
Exactly.

44:47.395 --> 44:52.984
He would have
made his move by now
if he was interested.

44:53.067 --> 44:56.696
-You want him, you've
got a fight on your hands.
-Fair enough.

44:58.156 --> 44:59.574
Here we go.

45:01.534 --> 45:06.080
Cooee! Yoo-hoo! Hello!

45:14.339 --> 45:16.758
Thank goodness
you're here, Officer.

45:16.841 --> 45:20.219
We seem to have broken down.

45:20.303 --> 45:23.681
Out here,
in the middle of nowhere.

45:23.765 --> 45:26.100
All on our lonesomes.

45:26.184 --> 45:27.643
Can't help you, I'm afraid.

45:27.727 --> 45:30.480
-We're on a manhunt.
-Well, so are we.

45:34.776 --> 45:37.737
Well, I suppose I
could spare 10 minutes.

45:39.864 --> 45:42.992
Is there anybody out there?
Will somebody speak to me?

45:43.076 --> 45:44.911
That's the second time you've
searched the place.

45:44.994 --> 45:47.038
I keep telling you,
we're not hiding anything.

45:47.121 --> 45:48.873
He was in there.
I spoke to him.

45:48.956 --> 45:50.917
Even your ranger says
there's
something funny going on.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.045
That's the great
thing about Duncan.
A very vivid imagination.

45:54.128 --> 45:55.713
It's one of
the reasons we employ him.

45:55.797 --> 45:57.215
How do you explain
all the yellow coats?

45:57.298 --> 45:58.716
It's the Highlands,
it rains a lot.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.135
Oh, arrest him. Make him talk.

46:01.219 --> 46:04.597
Mr McCullen, I think we
both know this is just
a pathetic attempt

46:04.681 --> 46:06.516
to sully my family name.

46:06.599 --> 46:09.227
-And why would that be?
-A little
incident with a painting.

46:09.310 --> 46:13.773
Perhaps you'd like to fill in
the details. Explain your
little business enterprise.

46:13.856 --> 46:17.944
Look,
um, maybe I was mistaken.

46:18.027 --> 46:21.781
So this is another
wild goose chase?

46:21.864 --> 46:25.493
Do you know
what the penalty is
for wasting police time?

46:32.125 --> 46:34.836
If that'll be all, gentlemen,
I do have an estate to run.

46:34.919 --> 46:36.295
(ENGINE DRONING)

46:36.379 --> 46:38.214
What's that?

46:40.091 --> 46:41.426
Sawmill?

47:07.869 --> 47:10.413
TOAD: I want you to
know how sorry I am.

47:10.496 --> 47:13.207
There's no need for all that.
Let's get you on board.

47:13.291 --> 47:17.795
Well,
look here, this is for you.
And this is for Archie.

47:17.879 --> 47:20.131
-Yes, open them later.
-Thanks.

47:20.214 --> 47:22.633
-Bon voyage, Toadie.
-Goodbye, Captain.

47:22.717 --> 47:25.261
Goodbye.
Take care of yourself.

47:26.929 --> 47:29.349
Mind how you go.
Don't fall in.

47:31.934 --> 47:35.480
All the best!
Have a good trip.

47:38.274 --> 47:41.944
-Stop!
-Enemy approaching.

47:42.028 --> 47:44.280
I'll hold them off
as long as I can.

47:45.615 --> 47:47.825
Stop that plane!

47:50.620 --> 47:52.163
I said stop!

47:58.878 --> 48:02.382
-You two are in
a lot of trouble.
-Why would that be?

48:02.465 --> 48:07.178
-Aiding and abetting
the escape of a fugitive.
-HECTOR: Fugitive?

48:07.261 --> 48:09.222
Did you see a
fugitive, Archie?

48:09.305 --> 48:11.516
No, definitely not.
How about you two?

48:14.686 --> 48:16.646
No, I didn't think so.

48:47.760 --> 48:49.595
Cheers.

48:50.638 --> 48:53.433
So, that's it.

48:53.516 --> 48:55.643
-That's it indeed.
-There you are.

48:55.727 --> 49:00.189
-They've got no
evidence and they know it.
-Oh, my two clever boys.

49:00.273 --> 49:03.151
Well, it was a team effort.
Well done, Dunc.

49:03.234 --> 49:04.944
Told you I could
do it, didn't I?

49:05.028 --> 49:07.905
Yeah, and I always
had every faith in you.

49:07.989 --> 49:10.324
Toad left this
for you, Archie.

49:16.664 --> 49:20.585
It's a cheque. Â£2,000.

49:20.668 --> 49:25.048
To cover the cost of the
painting, or be like
the piper and blow it.

49:27.258 --> 49:28.926
Oh, what's that?

49:29.719 --> 49:32.472
His, um, Military Cross.

49:45.735 --> 49:50.990
So, you've still got
your sharp tactical brain,
and now a medal to go with it.

49:51.074 --> 49:53.159
How does it feel?

49:53.242 --> 49:56.829
It's friendships that
are important, Molly,
not gongs.

49:58.414 --> 50:01.209
-Night-night.
-Good night, my darling.
