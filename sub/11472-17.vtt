ANNOUNCER: Previously
on <i>Freaks and Geeks...</i>

00:04.037 --> 00:07.407
Sergeant Pepper,
where's the rest of the
Lonely Hearts Club Band?

00:07.440 --> 00:09.442
Lindsay,
is this bonehead
a friend of yours?

00:11.344 --> 00:12.846
I like Sam.

00:12.879 --> 00:14.781
Oh.

00:14.815 --> 00:18.852
Do you think that
there's any chance that
this may actually happen?

00:18.885 --> 00:21.622
You really like her,
don't you?

00:28.494 --> 00:32.733
So, if they open
this new sporting goods
mega‐store at the mall,

00:32.766 --> 00:35.135
We're in for
a real fight.

00:35.168 --> 00:38.739
Well, if I were them,
I'd be the nervous ones.

00:38.772 --> 00:41.341
I wouldn't shop at
that big mega‐store
if you paid me.

00:41.374 --> 00:45.111
Oh, I like this girl.
Isn't she great, Lindsay?

00:45.145 --> 00:48.615
Uh, yeah,
she's great.

00:48.649 --> 00:53.253
So I hear something
very exciting is happening
this week at school.

00:53.286 --> 00:56.723
That's right. Vice President
George Herbert Walker Bush

00:56.757 --> 01:00.861
is coming to our school
to speak at an assembly
in the cafeteria.

01:00.894 --> 01:04.164
Boy, I wish there was a way
I could get the vice president
to stop at my store.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.266
You can't pay
for that kind of publicity.

01:06.299 --> 01:10.804
You know, the most
exciting thing is Cindy,
because she's head

01:10.837 --> 01:13.707
of the Young
Republicans Club,
gets to introduce him.

01:13.740 --> 01:18.311
Wow, that is a big honor,
isn't it Lindsay?

01:18.344 --> 01:20.881
Yeah, if you're
a Republican.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.683
Oh, and you're not?

01:22.716 --> 01:24.985
No, I'm a Democrat.

01:25.018 --> 01:28.188
You know, everyone's
a Democrat till they
get a little money.

01:28.221 --> 01:30.390
Then they come
to their senses.

doing a show in town tonight?

02:47.668 --> 02:52.105
No. George Bush
is coming to speak
to the school.

02:52.138 --> 02:53.740
The porn star?

02:53.774 --> 02:59.379
The Vice President
of the United States
of America. George Bush.

02:59.813 --> 03:00.847
Hey, guys.

03:00.881 --> 03:01.915
Hey.

03:01.948 --> 03:02.983
Hey.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.217
Hey.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.853
What's wrong?

03:06.887 --> 03:09.956
I'm a little nervous.
I just found out
we have to play

03:09.990 --> 03:13.794
Hail to the Chief
when Bush arrives.
There's a lot of tuba.

03:13.827 --> 03:17.197
Don't worry about it, Amy.
Bush probably doesn't know
anything about the tuba.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.665
I can see it now.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.735
(MIMICS HAIL TO THE CHIEF
OUT OF TUNE)

03:21.768 --> 03:23.003
(LAUGHING)

03:23.036 --> 03:25.205
Stop!

03:25.238 --> 03:28.208
All right, you guys. Come on,
beat it. There's no hanging
out under the stairs.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.543
What? Since when?

03:29.576 --> 03:31.712
Since the vice president
is coming.

03:31.745 --> 03:35.348
Come on, gimme a break.
The secret service wants
all these areas cleared out.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.285
How we ever gonna
plan our coup?

03:39.319 --> 03:43.724
Don't even joke, Desario.
I can get you thrown in jail
just for saying that.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.058
Come on, let's go.

03:45.091 --> 03:46.359
Coooooup. Coup. Coup.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.628
Don't joke about it.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.362
It's ok. I have
to practice, anyway.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.864
Want to hang out
after school?

03:50.897 --> 03:54.034
I don't know. I have
to practice. Gotta study.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.802
You're a bad influence.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.337
So I'll see you at 6:30?

04:00.206 --> 04:01.708
See ya.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.011
Bye.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.047
CINDY: I hope
the game's good tonight.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.314
GIRL: Definitely.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.450
It will be. Trust me.
Ha ha ha.

04:10.483 --> 04:11.885
Hey, guys.
What's happening?

04:11.918 --> 04:13.286
(OTHER TABLE LAUGHS)

04:13.319 --> 04:16.289
We don't know.
All going on
over there.

04:16.322 --> 04:18.358
(LAUGHING AND TALKING)

04:18.391 --> 04:20.661

down that dark path,

04:20.694 --> 04:23.096
forever will it
dominate your destiny.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.965
At least that's
what Yoda always says.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.902
I mean,
not all cheerleaders
have to be pretty,

04:28.935 --> 04:31.972
but their cheerleaders
aren't even remotely
pretty.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.507
I mean, they're dirty.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.109
You know what it is?
It's disrespectful.

04:36.142 --> 04:37.611
It's disrespectful
to their team.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.379
It's disrespectful
to their school.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.648
If I was their student body,
I wouldn't allow it.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.917
Hey, not all our
cheerleaders are pretty.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.020
You can say that again.
Todd, shut up.

04:47.053 --> 04:49.556
I wasn't talking about you.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.558
How about
you get over yourself?

04:53.426 --> 04:55.495
Sam, you're not
gonna defend me?

04:55.529 --> 04:58.999
What? He... He said
he wasn't talking about you.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.867
So you're just
gonna let it go?

05:00.901 --> 05:02.235
Would you stop?

05:02.268 --> 05:04.971
I like Sam.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.307
What, do you want
to see us fight?

05:08.408 --> 05:10.310
I'd like to see that.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.919
Mousetrap! I win!

05:18.952 --> 05:21.955
Congratulations, Bill.
Maybe you can get the school
to start a team.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.557
Funny.

05:25.191 --> 05:26.960
Sam, don't worry.
It's just a game.

05:26.993 --> 05:31.397
I mean, I'm good
at Mousetrap, and you're
really good at Kerplunk.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.033
No. No, no, no.
It's not that.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.669
It's just this thing
with Cindy.

05:35.702 --> 05:38.905
She's kinda...
She's kinda boring.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.841
Really?

05:40.874 --> 05:43.109
It's weird hanging out
with her friends.

05:43.143 --> 05:46.547
I mean, all she
ever wants to do
is make out and stuff.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.615
I'd kill
to be that bored.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.984
Maybe you're not
doing this right.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.687
I mean, aren't you
supposed to go out
on dates and stuff?

05:53.720 --> 05:56.289
Well, y‐yeah.
We went to the mall twice,

05:56.322 --> 05:57.958
and we went to this
football game once,

05:57.991 --> 06:01.795
And after that,
we went to a different mall.

06:01.828 --> 06:03.363
That sounds fantastic.

06:03.396 --> 06:05.799
Maybe you should
take her out on a date

06:05.832 --> 06:07.934
and do something
that you want to do.

06:07.968 --> 06:11.437
But what if she
doesn't want to do
what I want to do?

06:11.471 --> 06:13.339
Then why are you
going out with her?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.741
NEAL: Because she's a goddess!

06:14.775 --> 06:18.344
Am I the last sane man
on this godforsaken planet?

06:18.378 --> 06:22.849
Hey, pass her over here.
I'd move to the mall
if she wanted me to.

06:22.883 --> 06:26.987
All right. I'll ask.
Just shut up already.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.758
So how come we never
hang out at your house?

06:31.792 --> 06:34.394
Um, 'cause
I hate it there?

06:34.427 --> 06:35.796
Really?

06:35.829 --> 06:37.998
Yes, really.

06:38.031 --> 06:41.267
How come everyone
always thinks I'm
joking all the time?

06:41.301 --> 06:45.706
Something to do
with my voice, isn't it?
That's what I think.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.408
I mean, your parents
seem so nice.

06:49.876 --> 06:53.379
Well, they're not
bad people.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.449
They're good at their jobs.

06:56.482 --> 06:59.886
I guess...
I guess raising me

06:59.920 --> 07:02.956
wasn't one of the things
they learned
to do in college.

07:02.989 --> 07:06.126
So how'd you turn out
to be such a great guy?

07:06.159 --> 07:08.361
Am I?

07:08.394 --> 07:11.865
I don't know. I was, uh,
I was raised by a nanny.

07:11.898 --> 07:16.570
Yeah. Catherine.
She was pretty...
She was pretty great.

07:16.603 --> 07:20.073
She was the best mommy
money could buy.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.442
I didn't know that.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.880
I'm glad you told me.

07:26.913 --> 07:29.449
Yeah. Well.

07:31.351 --> 07:35.021
I think it's important
that we tell each other
everything.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.558
Don't you?

07:37.591 --> 07:40.527
Yeah. Of course.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.698
I want to tell you
something about myself.

07:44.731 --> 07:48.234
It's really important,
so you gotta promise me
you won't freak out.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.304
Oh, I'm pretty hard
to freak out.

07:51.337 --> 07:54.508
No, I'm serious.
You promise?

07:54.541 --> 07:58.812
I can try to promise.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.314
If you killed someone
or something, though...

08:01.347 --> 08:03.884
No. You know, forget it.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.151
I'm sorry.

08:11.091 --> 08:15.929
Well... This isn't really
that uncommon.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.498
But...

08:20.133 --> 08:22.035
But when I was born...

08:23.570 --> 08:26.172
I had the potential to be...

08:28.975 --> 08:30.911
Male or female.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.046
Yeah. You, too.

08:33.079 --> 08:38.519
No, I mean... I mean,
I was born with both...

08:41.354 --> 08:43.957
Both male and female parts.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.293
Uh‐huh.

08:49.495 --> 08:51.632
My parents made a decision
with the doctors

08:51.665 --> 08:53.700
that I should be a girl.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.169
I mean, thank God,
because that's who I am.

08:56.202 --> 09:01.241
But it's still a really
big part of my life...

09:02.509 --> 09:04.310
And I thought you should know.

09:06.547 --> 09:13.253
No, this is... Good
that you told me this.

09:14.354 --> 09:17.323
Are you freaking out?

09:17.357 --> 09:22.796
No. You know, it...
You're... You're, uh,
you're all girl now.

09:22.829 --> 09:23.997
Yeah.

09:24.030 --> 09:27.901
Yeah. So, you know,
it's ok, you know?

09:27.934 --> 09:31.905
It's, uh, if I was
dating you when
you were just born,

09:31.938 --> 09:33.674
Things, uh, might be
a little different

09:33.707 --> 09:35.909
'cause of
all that stuff.

09:35.942 --> 09:43.116
But now you're, uh,
you're all girl now,
so it's... Ok.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.619
Thanks, Ken.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.888
Yeah. You know,
it's, uh, I, uh,

09:47.921 --> 09:53.660
I had my appendix
out, so you know,
I've been there.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.196
Ha ha ha ha.

10:01.702 --> 10:06.439
Lindsay, Old Jeff Rosso
is about to make your day.

10:06.472 --> 10:11.277
You've heard of a guy
named Vice President
George Bush, haven't you?

10:11.311 --> 10:12.445
Yeah.

10:12.478 --> 10:16.883
Well, I've arranged for you
to ask him the first question

10:16.917 --> 10:19.953
during the informal Q and A
with the student body.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.356
I don't want to do that.

10:23.389 --> 10:24.625
Why?

10:24.658 --> 10:27.160
Because I'm a Democrat.

10:27.528 --> 10:28.995
So?

10:29.029 --> 10:31.965
So I wouldn't
have voted for Reagan
if I was old enough.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.100
Why would I want
to talk to his lackey?

10:34.134 --> 10:36.236
Gee, I don't know.

10:36.269 --> 10:39.573
Maybe because he's the second
most powerful man on earth.

10:39.606 --> 10:43.944
Maybe because we live
in a country where we can
actually question our leaders

10:43.977 --> 10:46.479
without fear
of being hacked to death
by a machete.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.681
Mr. Rosso, I didn't...

10:47.714 --> 10:49.750
Hey, you know what?
Forget it.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.018
I don't want you to talk
to the vice president.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.888
Plenty of people here
who actually care
about their country.

10:54.921 --> 10:58.825
I guess me and my
hippie friends were all
just wasting our time

10:58.859 --> 11:01.595
at Berkeley demonstrating
and stopping an unjust war.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.730
Probably shouldn't
have bothered.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.398
Ok, Mr. Rosso. Stop.

11:05.431 --> 11:10.270
Come on, Lindsay.
I was so excited
for you to do it!

11:10.303 --> 11:12.939
You're a special person,
and it's your destiny,

11:12.973 --> 11:17.310
if you like it or not,
to be interacting
with world leaders.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.479
Do you really believe that?

11:19.513 --> 11:21.114
You bet I do.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.851
Ok. Fine. I'll do it.

11:24.885 --> 11:28.655
I've got the best job
in the world!

11:28.689 --> 11:31.391
12 grand a year,
and I'm overpaid.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.460
Excuse me, sir.
I'm gonna have to ask

11:34.494 --> 11:36.563
you and this young lady
to please leave the office.

11:36.597 --> 11:38.098
Anything wrong?

11:38.131 --> 11:39.733
No, sir. We just need
to inspect and cordon
off these areas

11:39.766 --> 11:41.101
Until after the
vice president's visit.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.604
Uh, where am I
supposed to work?

11:43.637 --> 11:45.438
Sorry, sir,
it's not my problem.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.743
Thanks very much.
Isn't this exciting?

11:49.776 --> 11:52.946
Thank you. Do me a favor?
Give me a room sweep
on the left side.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.881
Yeah.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.817
Uh, crockpot, you're
going to get a visual
on that bogie.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.318
He's coming at you.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.854
He's about 6'3".
Real Dr. Feelgood look.
Check him out.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.663
Wow. It's sixth period
already.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.131
Yep.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.635
Did you have
a good lunch?

12:14.668 --> 12:19.305
I thought the cafeteria food
looked a little gross,
so I had an apple.

12:19.339 --> 12:23.877
It was actually
pretty good. If you
like Salisbury steak.

12:25.111 --> 12:26.580
(BELL RINGS)

12:26.613 --> 12:29.215
Um... I have to get
to math, so...

12:29.249 --> 12:30.884
Yeah, I got chemistry.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.463
Give you a call.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.601
So what should I ask?

12:47.634 --> 12:50.103
Well, ask him
something really tough.

12:50.136 --> 12:53.339
Put him on the spot.
What would he not
want to talk about?

12:53.373 --> 12:56.342
They say that Reagan
had Iran delay the release
of the hostages

12:56.376 --> 12:58.111
after he was elected.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.781
You should ask him about that.
Write that one down.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.949
I bet he flips.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.686
I want to ask him about
trickle‐down economics.

13:05.719 --> 13:08.622
Oh, Lindsay, that's boring.
Nobody wants to hear
about that.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.056
Here, give me this notebook.
Kim...

13:10.090 --> 13:13.994
I want to ask him
about the aliens at Roswell.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.929
(LAUGHING)
Come on.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.098
I gotta write down
some real questions.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.465
Ok.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.636
How's it going?

13:22.669 --> 13:24.771
Great. I think I'm gonna
get a "B" in math.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.139
I'm so relieved.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.176
Cindy, I was kinda
thinking that maybe

13:30.210 --> 13:33.947
you'd like to go out
on a date with me.
Like a real date, you know?

13:33.980 --> 13:36.950
Sam, you're so sweet.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.252
Of course I'll go out
on a date with you.

13:39.285 --> 13:40.954
Yeah?

13:40.987 --> 13:43.056
Hey, you know
what we could do?
All the football players

13:43.089 --> 13:45.959
are going to these
batting cages, like this
goofy‐golf type place,

13:45.992 --> 13:48.729
and then afterwards,
they're gonna go
swim in this lake.

13:48.762 --> 13:51.231
Doesn't that sound
like fun?

13:51.264 --> 13:58.138
Yeah. Well, actually,
I was thinking that maybe
I could plan the date.

13:58.171 --> 14:03.844
I'd take you out.
It would be my surprise.
It would be on me, you know?

14:03.877 --> 14:08.582
I get it. You want to
take your girlfriend out
like a real gentleman.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.251
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

14:11.284 --> 14:15.656
You know what? I think
that's really romantic.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.624
(EXHALES)

14:26.600 --> 14:31.004
I can't take this
anymore. Why are you
acting like this?

14:31.672 --> 14:33.173
Acting like what?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.075
You can't even look at me!

14:36.977 --> 14:39.045
I'm looking at you.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.181
What are you thinking
about what I told you?

14:42.916 --> 14:47.487
Nothing.
You know, you told me,
and I'm fine with it.

14:47.521 --> 14:50.090
You're not fine with it!

14:50.123 --> 14:52.158
You're acting
completely weird.

14:52.192 --> 14:55.428
Well, I don't think I am.

14:55.461 --> 15:00.066
I mean, how am I supposed
to act after you tell me
something like that?

15:00.100 --> 15:04.905
I don't know,
but you're not
reacting at all.

15:04.938 --> 15:10.577
I don't know what to say.
There's nothing I can do.
I... I can't change it.

15:10.611 --> 15:11.978
You're such a jerk.

15:13.346 --> 15:18.719
Amy, tell me what to say,
'cause clearly you have
something in mind.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.186
Do you still like me?

15:20.220 --> 15:22.989
Yeah! Of course
I like you still.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.625
And you can live
with this?

15:24.658 --> 15:30.030
Live with what? It's over.
I mean, you know, move on.

15:30.063 --> 15:34.968
Ken, you don't understand.
It's not that easy.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.337
No matter
what the doctors did,

15:37.370 --> 15:39.673
there's always gonna be
some part of me that's...

15:42.275 --> 15:43.510
A guy?

15:43.544 --> 15:44.545
No. Forget it.

15:49.550 --> 15:54.020
(BAD ENGLISH ACCENT)
If it were me, I'd take
her to a Broadway Show.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.722
Broadway?
We're in Michigan.

15:55.756 --> 15:57.357
(NORMAL VOICE)
Dinner theater?

15:57.390 --> 15:59.893
The Jerk is playing
at the discount theater.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.062
That's not
exactly romantic.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.130
Laughter is the ultimate
aphrodisiac.

16:04.164 --> 16:07.000
Get a woman laughing
and you've got a woman loving.

16:07.033 --> 16:09.302
You gotta get her
a really good present.

16:09.335 --> 16:12.238
You could make her something.
Like out of paper mache.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.641
Yeah, that's great.
It's from the heart.

16:14.675 --> 16:18.211
Hey, Harris?
What kind of presents
do you get Judith?

16:18.244 --> 16:20.446
Judith has very
particular tastes.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.215
About the only thing
she ever wants

16:22.248 --> 16:25.552
is scented oils
and plenty of time
with her man.

16:25.586 --> 16:27.588
EVERYBODY: Yuck!

16:27.621 --> 16:30.256
I have the perfect gift.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.257
What is it?

16:31.291 --> 16:33.694
Your grandmother
gave this to me

16:33.727 --> 16:35.829
when I was just
about Cindy's age.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.598
It's an heirloom.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.369
I thought it was
the most elegant
thing I'd ever seen,

16:43.403 --> 16:45.471
and I'm sure if your
grandmother knew

16:45.506 --> 16:49.175
how important this was
to you, she would want
you to have it.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.312
And I want you
to have it.

16:52.345 --> 16:56.082
After all, this
is your first love.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.351
Thanks, Mom.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.400
I think I'm gonna
break up with Amy.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.703
What? Why?

17:16.737 --> 17:22.876
I just... You know, I don't...
I don't really think
we're right for each other.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.579
Really? Oh.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.181
I thought
you two were sort of
the perfect couple.

17:30.817 --> 17:34.454
Ok, look, I'm going
to tell you guys
something now,

17:34.487 --> 17:37.423
and you have to promise
not to be jerks about it

17:37.457 --> 17:41.227
and not to tell anyone
ever, ok?

17:41.261 --> 17:42.829
Yeah, that's cool, man.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.534
Amy's not really a girl.

17:49.469 --> 17:50.470
What?

17:50.504 --> 17:53.306
I mean, you know,
she is... She's a girl,

17:53.339 --> 17:57.110
but she's kinda...
She's kinda part guy, too.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.079
What's that mean?

17:59.112 --> 18:03.049
It means that
when she was born,

18:03.083 --> 18:09.089
she was packing both
a gun and the holster.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.793
Um...

18:14.695 --> 18:20.300
Well, does...
Does she still have,
you know... The gun?

18:20.333 --> 18:24.304
No. The doctors
took care of it.

18:24.738 --> 18:25.739
Ok.

18:27.473 --> 18:28.609
Well, then...

18:29.242 --> 18:30.977
She's a girl.

18:31.011 --> 18:33.580
NICK: I don't think
it works that way.

18:33.614 --> 18:35.448
I think you
better get rid of her.

18:36.717 --> 18:41.688
I don't want
to break up with her.
I really like her.

18:41.722 --> 18:46.660
I might even... Love her.

18:47.761 --> 18:48.929
Really?

18:48.962 --> 18:50.263
Yeah.

18:55.936 --> 18:57.470
Does that mean you're gay?

18:58.404 --> 19:01.742
I don't know. Does it?

19:02.275 --> 19:03.877
I was joking.

19:04.878 --> 19:06.179
Oh.

19:10.283 --> 19:13.186
Well, welcome
to my new "office,"

19:13.219 --> 19:15.288
courtesy of big brother.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.559
It's kind of cramped.
Sorry about that.

19:18.592 --> 19:19.926
Quite all right.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.963
All right. Ken Miller.
Here. Talkin'.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.931
What can I do for you?

19:24.965 --> 19:29.135
Um, I, uh, can't
believe it myself,

19:29.169 --> 19:33.640
but I actually came here
to ask you some advice.

19:33.674 --> 19:35.542
Well, that's
what they pay me for.

19:35.576 --> 19:37.377
Yeah. Um...

19:38.779 --> 19:44.818
Well, there's a small

19:44.851 --> 19:46.820
little chance that...

19:52.025 --> 19:54.661
I might be gay.

19:56.062 --> 19:59.833
I see. That's cool.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.603
And, you know, I thought
you'd be a good person

20:02.636 --> 20:05.405
to talk to about it,
since you're gay.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.774
I'm not gay.

20:07.808 --> 20:09.442
You're not?

20:09.475 --> 20:10.877
No.

20:10.911 --> 20:15.448
Oh. Man.
I just always thought...

20:15.481 --> 20:18.251
Why did you think that?

20:18.284 --> 20:24.825
I... I don't know.
You just... You kinda
have this way about you,

20:24.858 --> 20:27.861
and I've... I've never
seen you with a woman.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.598
I don't bring dates to school.

20:31.632 --> 20:34.200
Look, there's nothing
wrong with being gay.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.402
it's just not
my personal preference.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.741
I think I'd
better get going.

20:40.774 --> 20:44.344
Ken, you can stay
and talk about this.

20:44.377 --> 20:47.480
No, I don't think I can.

Come on!

22:12.666 --> 22:15.268
Mother...
Mr. Rosso?

22:15.301 --> 22:17.103
Lindsay.
What are you doing?

22:17.137 --> 22:18.972
I locked my keys
in my car.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.807
You need some help?

22:20.841 --> 22:22.475
I think I can handle it.

22:24.077 --> 22:25.946
Oh...

22:25.979 --> 22:31.084
Bush's people rejected
your questions. So they've
written one for you. Here.

22:31.117 --> 22:34.555
"What is your
favorite place to eat
in the State of Michigan?"

22:35.355 --> 22:37.724
What the... What happened?

22:37.758 --> 22:40.861
The Bush people
found the ones you wrote
too sophisticated.

22:40.894 --> 22:43.263
Sophisticated?
What does that mean?

22:43.296 --> 22:47.400
That's code for "Nice try,
but this is a glorified
photo opportunity."

22:48.301 --> 22:50.270
Look, I'm disappointed,
too, ok?

22:50.303 --> 22:52.973
But let's try and keep
a positive perspective
on all this, ok?

22:53.006 --> 22:54.775
You actually
get to interact

22:54.808 --> 22:57.578
with the Vice President
of the United States.
That's historic.

22:57.611 --> 22:59.479
Ooh. Maybe if I'm
lucky, he'll tell me

22:59.513 --> 23:01.481
which steakhouse
has the best prime rib.

23:01.515 --> 23:03.584
Don't you think
I'm P. O.'d, too?

23:03.617 --> 23:06.620
I thought we were gonna
have an actual political
conversation.

23:06.653 --> 23:09.189
You can't win
with these people.

23:09.222 --> 23:12.993
You know what all
my protesting accomplished
in the sixties at Berkeley?

23:13.026 --> 23:17.097
16 scars on my head
from a tear‐gas canister.

23:17.130 --> 23:19.966
We tried to get 'em to stop
the war. They stopped the war
when they felt like it.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.504
And now all
my compatriots are gettin'
rich working Wall Street,

23:23.537 --> 23:27.508
and I can't get my keys
out of my mother's car.

23:27.541 --> 23:30.811
What, that's it?
You're just gonna
give up?

23:30.844 --> 23:33.179
Come on. There's
nothing we can do?

23:33.213 --> 23:35.081
No, there's
something we can do.

23:35.115 --> 23:38.184
You can go get
brooksie the Janitor
to come out here and help me.

23:41.988 --> 23:45.058
So I told Todd that
Republicans aren't...
Selfish.

23:45.091 --> 23:48.662
It's just that they
don't believe poor people
should get handouts.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.463
I mean,
they should get jobs.

23:50.496 --> 23:53.233
Handouts just make them lazy,
don't you think?

23:53.266 --> 23:56.169
Uh, I don't know.
I guess so.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.004
Well, they do.

23:58.038 --> 24:04.044
Todd never understood.
He's a Democrat.
They like handouts.

24:05.546 --> 24:10.984
Um, and speaking
of handouts, ha ha,

24:11.017 --> 24:13.019
uh, I got you something.

24:13.053 --> 24:17.524
Really? Sam, you're
the best boyfriend.

24:17.558 --> 24:19.025
What'd you get me?

24:23.897 --> 24:25.031
What is it?

24:26.332 --> 24:27.467
It's an heirloom
necklace.

24:27.500 --> 24:30.336
It's been in our family
for generations.

24:30.370 --> 24:31.838
How much did it cost?

24:31.872 --> 24:34.808
Um, I don't know.
It's an heirloom.

24:34.841 --> 24:38.111
Well, thank you.
That's very sweet.

24:41.782 --> 24:44.017
Well, do you want me
to put it on you?

24:44.050 --> 24:46.019
No, that's ok.

24:46.052 --> 24:50.657
You know, it's metal,
so it'd be cold on my neck
and everything.

24:54.360 --> 24:57.764
Isn't that stupid?
They're afraid
of real questions.

24:57.798 --> 24:59.900
He's not coming
to your high school
to be interrogated

24:59.933 --> 25:02.869
by a bunch
of pimple‐faced teenagers.

25:02.903 --> 25:04.905
You have to be polite
to the man.

25:04.938 --> 25:07.674
Oh, so if you have
a zit, you're not entitled
to an opinion? Is that it?

25:07.708 --> 25:09.776
I just think
it's nice he's coming.

25:09.810 --> 25:12.679
I mean, I'm sure
he's a very busy man.

25:12.713 --> 25:16.783
Busy doing what?
Waiting for the president
to die so he can take over?

25:16.817 --> 25:18.151
Lindsay.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.353
Look, there's a more
important opportunity

25:20.386 --> 25:23.657
to be had here.
I was thinking...

25:23.690 --> 25:27.127
When you ask your question,
you can mention my store.

25:28.061 --> 25:29.095
Dad, that's sick.

25:29.129 --> 25:32.032
It would be sick
if we went out of business.

25:32.065 --> 25:36.469
Your only affiliation
right now to any party
is to the Weir party.

25:36.503 --> 25:37.571
We need help.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.673
Mom, tell him
to stop, please.

25:39.706 --> 25:42.008
No, honey,
this is serious.

25:42.042 --> 25:45.546
Those mega‐stores
can offer discounts
your father can't.

25:45.579 --> 25:47.648
This is no big deal.
All you have to do is say,

25:47.681 --> 25:53.386
"Hi, I'm Lindsay Weir.
My father owns A‐1 Sporting
Goods out on 16 mile,"

25:53.419 --> 25:57.257
and then, "What's
your favorite place
to eat in Michigan?"

25:58.692 --> 26:00.460
I can't believe you're
asking me to do that.

26:00.493 --> 26:02.095
Oh, and maybe
you could wear

26:02.128 --> 26:04.698
one of the store's
new T‐shirts.
Show her, honey.

26:13.273 --> 26:16.510
<i>He hates these cans!</i>

26:16.543 --> 26:18.945
<i>Stay away</i>
<i>from the cans!</i>

26:18.979 --> 26:21.014
Ha ha ha ha!

26:30.156 --> 26:32.626
<i>More cans!</i>

26:40.300 --> 26:42.035
Isn't this great?

26:42.068 --> 26:44.805
Yeah, I guess so.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.544
Do you want some
popcorn or something?

26:50.577 --> 26:53.847
Will popcorn make
this movie funnier?

26:56.082 --> 26:59.686
Y‐you don't think
this movie is funny?

27:00.420 --> 27:04.324
No. I think it's stupid.

27:04.357 --> 27:06.126
I mean, come on,
how old is this guy?

27:06.159 --> 27:10.096
He's got gray hair,
and he's running around
like a 5‐year‐old.

27:10.130 --> 27:11.297
<i>What?</i>

27:11.331 --> 27:13.066
(GUNFIRE)

27:17.538 --> 27:18.839
Sam?

27:21.007 --> 27:22.242
Yeah?

27:24.545 --> 27:25.879
What are you...

27:27.514 --> 27:28.815
Ow!

27:28.849 --> 27:30.316
What are you doing?

27:30.350 --> 27:32.653
I'm giving you something.

27:32.686 --> 27:35.021
Oh, god, what are
you giving me?

27:35.055 --> 27:37.858
I'm giving you
a hickey, you goof.

27:41.094 --> 27:43.063
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>I'm endangering</i>
<i>your life!</i>

27:43.096 --> 27:45.465
<i>Cover me!</i>
<i>You're covered!</i>

27:45.498 --> 27:48.434
No, you guys, really,
Rosso's cool.

27:48.468 --> 27:50.837
Did you ever
really look at him?

27:50.871 --> 27:53.139
He's actually
kind of good‐looking.

27:53.173 --> 27:56.677
Yeah, if you're
attracted to guys
that look like Jesus.

27:56.710 --> 27:58.078
Shut up!

27:58.111 --> 27:59.546
Hey.

27:59.580 --> 28:01.715
Hey, what's up?
Hey, guys.

28:03.684 --> 28:05.586
What's that supposed
to mean, Daniel?

28:05.619 --> 28:08.922
How's it going, guys?

28:13.026 --> 28:16.730
Oh, Jesus, Ken,
I didn't mean it like that.

28:18.498 --> 28:21.367
What the hell, Ken?

28:23.136 --> 28:24.938
Oh, my God.

28:27.541 --> 28:28.775
LINDSAY:
Hey, Daniel, you ok?

28:28.809 --> 28:30.844
Yeah, I'm all right.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.145
Are you guys
gonna tell us

28:32.178 --> 28:33.847
what the hell
that was all about?

28:33.880 --> 28:35.248
Just forget it, Kim.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.483
Daniel, he just
punched you in the face!

28:37.518 --> 28:40.020
Give it a rest, ok?

28:45.458 --> 28:47.994
(TAPPING) Amy.

28:51.197 --> 28:52.999
Amy!

28:53.033 --> 28:56.136
Can you just please
let me explain?

28:56.169 --> 28:58.939
I'm an idiot.
Please, just...

29:24.030 --> 29:25.098
Hey.

29:26.767 --> 29:28.401
You ok?

29:28.434 --> 29:29.469
Yeah.

29:29.503 --> 29:31.538
Are you?
You look weird.

29:31.572 --> 29:34.007
Huh?

29:34.040 --> 29:37.277
My best friends
were punching each other
in the face tonight.

29:39.713 --> 29:41.481
Cindy and me went
to see <i>The Jerk,</i>

29:41.515 --> 29:43.349
and she didn't
laugh once.

29:43.650 --> 29:44.985
Uh‐oh.

29:45.018 --> 29:46.419
What's wrong with me?

29:47.087 --> 29:48.388
I mean,
she's so pretty.

29:48.421 --> 29:50.090
How come I don't like her?

29:50.123 --> 29:51.592
Sam, just 'cause
a girl's pretty

29:51.625 --> 29:53.527
doesn't mean
she's right for you.

29:54.828 --> 29:56.830
Not all good‐looking
people are cool.

29:57.831 --> 29:59.065
Yeah, I know.

29:59.099 --> 30:00.667
Well, don't
worry about it.

30:00.701 --> 30:01.868
If it doesn't
feel right,

30:01.902 --> 30:03.336
you can always
break up with her.

30:03.369 --> 30:06.573
No, I can't break up
with Cindy Sanders.

30:07.307 --> 30:09.042
Why not?

30:09.075 --> 30:11.311
Because people would
think I'm crazy.

30:12.178 --> 30:13.680
Why?

30:13.714 --> 30:16.149
Well, because they
can't believe that...

30:16.182 --> 30:19.119
She's going out with me
in the first place.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.590
Sam, you can't just
keep dating someone

30:23.624 --> 30:25.458
if you don't like them.

30:30.363 --> 30:31.397
And...

30:32.633 --> 30:33.834
What's that
on your neck?

30:33.867 --> 30:36.436
(SIGHS) A hickey.

30:39.740 --> 30:41.908
Man, Sam.
What?

30:42.375 --> 30:43.710
Let me see it.

30:43.744 --> 30:44.911
You better wear
a turtleneck

30:44.945 --> 30:46.580
before Mom
and Dad see that.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.436
Come on, man, get in.

31:10.470 --> 31:12.172
I'll drive you home.

31:18.645 --> 31:20.380
Come on.

31:44.638 --> 31:45.906
Tricia, nice blouse.

31:45.939 --> 31:48.174
Red, white, and blue
looks good on you.

31:50.677 --> 31:52.112
Good morning, miss.

31:53.413 --> 31:54.815
Wow!

31:54.848 --> 31:56.883
Mr. Rosso,
you look really good.

31:56.917 --> 32:00.353
I clean up nice,
if I do say so myself.

32:00.386 --> 32:01.555
So, you ready?

32:01.588 --> 32:04.190
Yeah, I guess. Are you?

32:04.224 --> 32:06.392
Yeah. That whole thing
in the parking lot,

32:06.426 --> 32:08.762
that was crazy.
That was inappropriate.

32:08.795 --> 32:10.564
But we shouldn't
get so worked up about it.

32:10.597 --> 32:13.033
Let's just have fun.
The Vice President is here!

32:13.066 --> 32:14.535
It's exciting, isn't it?

32:23.276 --> 32:24.778
Hey.

32:24.811 --> 32:26.780
Hey.

32:26.813 --> 32:28.515
So,

32:28.549 --> 32:30.150
You really
gonna do it?

32:32.418 --> 32:34.487
I'm a member
of the Weir party.

32:34.521 --> 32:37.057
Ha ha ha ha!

32:37.090 --> 32:38.659
My stomach hurts.

32:38.692 --> 32:40.293
Yeah, my stomach
would hurt, too,

32:40.326 --> 32:42.395
if I was breaking up
with the prettiest
girl in school.

32:42.428 --> 32:44.698
NEAL: I'm glad
your stomach hurts.

32:44.731 --> 32:46.667
Know what that is?
It's your body
telling you

32:46.700 --> 32:48.068
you're making
a big mistake.

32:48.101 --> 32:50.604
No, Neal, I'm not
making a mistake, ok?

32:50.637 --> 32:53.940
Just because a girl's pretty
doesn't mean that she's cool.

32:53.974 --> 32:55.375
Ok, Sam,

32:55.408 --> 32:57.210
first of all,
of course it does.

32:57.243 --> 32:59.780
And secondly,
you're just scared.

32:59.813 --> 33:02.082
I mean, years from now
you're gonna be sitting
in your house,

33:02.115 --> 33:03.550
looking at your
unattractive kids

33:04.088 --> 33:05.579
with your unattractive wife,
saying to yourself,

33:05.579 --> 33:08.952
"Man, why did I ever
dump that goddess
Cindy Sanders?"

33:09.608 --> 33:16.280
You know what?
I can't listen to
any more of this.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.282
Have I ever told you
about the time

33:18.315 --> 33:20.384
that I made out
with Vicki Appleby?

33:20.417 --> 33:21.553
Oh, shut up.

33:22.687 --> 33:23.955
You're such a liar.

33:25.523 --> 33:26.824
Hey, Amy.

33:26.858 --> 33:28.926
Whoa, wait up!

33:28.960 --> 33:30.327
Is everything ok?

33:30.361 --> 33:32.897
No. I can't even believe
I came to school today.

33:32.930 --> 33:35.066
Well, what's going on?

33:35.099 --> 33:36.834
Like you don't know,
Lindsay.

33:36.868 --> 33:38.970
No, I don't.

33:39.003 --> 33:41.105
You mean Ken
didn't tell you?

33:41.138 --> 33:43.340
Nobody'll
tell me anything.

33:43.374 --> 33:46.043
Do you want to
talk to me?

33:46.077 --> 33:48.379
Maybe I could help you.

33:48.412 --> 33:50.948
You know, Lindsay,
don't worry about it.

33:50.982 --> 33:53.350
I'll see you later.

33:53.384 --> 33:55.252
Hey, Amy!

33:55.286 --> 33:58.590
Good luck with
Hail to the Chief!

33:58.623 --> 33:59.657
Thanks.

34:17.775 --> 34:19.611
Hey.

34:19.644 --> 34:21.078
Are you Lindsay's brother?

34:21.579 --> 34:23.180
Sam. Yeah.

34:25.583 --> 34:26.684
Did you just puke?

34:27.384 --> 34:29.286
No. I'm nervous.

34:31.723 --> 34:33.491
Because of George Bush?

34:33.525 --> 34:35.527
I'm gonna break up
with Cindy Sanders.

34:37.094 --> 34:39.363
Wow. Why, man?

34:39.396 --> 34:40.397
She's hot.

34:43.034 --> 34:46.437
You know,
she's just really
different than I am.

34:46.471 --> 34:50.374
Yeah. I... I know
how that one goes.

34:50.407 --> 34:54.612
I've been thinking
I have to break up
with my girlfriend, too.

34:55.212 --> 34:56.581
(MOCKING) Oh, how come?

34:57.949 --> 34:59.717
It's complicated.

35:00.518 --> 35:03.054
Very complicated.

35:04.622 --> 35:06.257
(SIGHS)

35:06.290 --> 35:08.359
It's just we don't
have anything in common.

35:08.392 --> 35:11.195
I mean, she thought
The Jerk was stupid.

35:11.629 --> 35:13.430
You serious?

35:13.465 --> 35:17.201
Man, my girlfriend
loved <i>The Jerk.</i>

35:18.235 --> 35:20.404
Well, we don't have
anything to talk about.

35:20.437 --> 35:22.707
She doesn't like
anything that I like.

35:24.408 --> 35:26.978
We never have
any fun together.

35:27.011 --> 35:28.980
That's too bad, man.

35:29.013 --> 35:35.286
Really, my... My girlfriend's
pretty cool when it comes
to stuff like that.

35:36.220 --> 35:38.556
God, then
what's the problem?

35:42.159 --> 35:44.562
I don't know.

35:44.596 --> 35:47.098
Well, I'm gonna break up
with Cindy Sanders.

35:48.666 --> 35:49.801
Good luck, buddy.

35:49.834 --> 35:50.835
Thanks.

36:10.287 --> 36:12.990
Sam, I've been
looking all over...

36:13.024 --> 36:14.659
What the hell is that?

36:15.026 --> 36:16.461
What?

36:16.494 --> 36:18.896
Sam, you're
wearing a turtleneck.

36:20.532 --> 36:22.299
Are you covering up
my hickey?

36:22.333 --> 36:25.369
What? No! No,
I... I...

36:25.402 --> 36:27.772
It's kind of
embarrassing.

36:27.805 --> 36:29.607
Come on,
don't get all mad.

36:29.641 --> 36:31.308
Oh, thanks, Sam.

36:31.342 --> 36:33.110
So I guess if you
got me a diamond ring

36:33.144 --> 36:34.979
and I didn't wear it
because I was too embarrassed,

36:35.012 --> 36:36.247
you wouldn't
get all mad, either?

36:36.280 --> 36:38.182
Hey, come on!
I got you a necklace,

36:38.215 --> 36:39.584
and you've never worn it.

36:39.617 --> 36:40.818
It was ugly!

36:40.852 --> 36:42.554
It was an heirloom.

36:42.587 --> 36:45.356
Sam, do not start a fight
with me right now, ok?

36:45.389 --> 36:47.759
I have to go in there
and introduce Bush.

36:52.096 --> 36:53.498
Cindy...

36:53.531 --> 36:54.666
What?

36:59.637 --> 37:01.939
I don't want to be
your boyfriend anymore.

37:04.776 --> 37:07.579
I just want to go back
to being friends.

37:07.945 --> 37:09.180
Friends?

37:11.148 --> 37:13.551
Why would you just
want to be my friend?

37:13.585 --> 37:15.520
I just really want
to be your friend.

37:15.553 --> 37:16.954
Like before.

37:18.022 --> 37:19.323
No.

37:19.757 --> 37:20.992
No?

37:21.025 --> 37:24.328
No, Sam, you can't
break up with me.

37:24.361 --> 37:26.430
You're supposed
to be nice.

37:26.464 --> 37:28.099
That's the only reason
why I'm going out with you

37:28.132 --> 37:29.534
in the first place.

37:29.567 --> 37:31.068
Hey, I am nice!

37:31.102 --> 37:33.871
I'm just not
having any fun. Are you?

37:38.643 --> 37:39.677
No.

37:41.245 --> 37:43.648
No, I'm not
having any fun, Sam.

37:45.483 --> 37:48.586
Have your stupid
heirloom back.

38:00.064 --> 38:02.934
Um, you did
the right thing.

38:02.967 --> 38:04.301
You're too
good for her.

38:05.537 --> 38:08.405
Are you gonna eat
with us at lunch today?

38:09.641 --> 38:10.808
Yeah, yeah.

38:12.209 --> 38:13.410
Thank God.

38:20.985 --> 38:22.453
Let's go.

38:59.056 --> 39:00.625
I'm sorry.

39:00.658 --> 39:06.397
And I don't care,
and I'm so sorry.

39:24.015 --> 39:25.983
I have to get
to the assembly.

39:26.017 --> 39:27.819
Ok.

39:39.363 --> 39:42.767
All right,
everyone just eat
like you'd normally eat.

39:45.970 --> 39:50.107
Hello, my name's Rosso.
It'll be on your list.

39:56.681 --> 39:59.316
Jeffery Theodore Rosso?
Yes.

39:59.350 --> 40:03.154
Sir, could you step
over here for a second?

40:03.187 --> 40:05.356
Sir, are you now
or have you ever been

40:05.389 --> 40:09.093
a member of an organization
called the Taft Students
Alliance for a New America?

40:09.126 --> 40:10.728
No.

40:10.762 --> 40:12.930
I mean, I might be
on their mailing list

40:12.964 --> 40:15.399
somewhere from way back,
but I'm certainly not...

40:15.432 --> 40:17.835
Well, unfortunately,
you've been red‐flagged
as a security risk.

40:17.869 --> 40:19.771
I can't allow you
to attend the assembly.

40:19.804 --> 40:21.272
There must be a mistake.
I work here.

40:21.305 --> 40:22.640
Yeah, I know.

40:22.674 --> 40:24.576
Ok, now, I'm just
gonna have to escort you

40:24.609 --> 40:26.443
to a little holding area
that we've established
over here.

40:26.478 --> 40:28.112
Oh, there he is!

40:28.145 --> 40:29.714
Mr. Rosso,
thank you so much

40:29.747 --> 40:32.216
for getting Lindsay
this opportunity.

40:32.249 --> 40:34.251
LINDSAY:
Hey, Mr. Rosso,
what's going on?

40:34.285 --> 40:35.853
Where are you going?

40:35.887 --> 40:39.223
I guess I rocked
the boat a little bit
in my youth.

40:39.256 --> 40:41.493
Don't worry
about it, Lindsay.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.928
Just go in there
and make the school proud.

40:43.961 --> 40:45.129
Mr. Rosso, please.

40:45.162 --> 40:47.499
Step back. Step away.

40:50.768 --> 40:52.570
JEAN: Wow.

40:55.473 --> 40:58.843
See, I told you
that guy was a kook.

41:02.379 --> 41:03.881
So what do
you teach here?

41:03.915 --> 41:06.718
Actually, I'm
a guidance counselor.

41:06.751 --> 41:08.252
Really?

41:08.285 --> 41:10.522
Sometimes I have to
just stand in one place

41:10.555 --> 41:13.891
for 12 hours
and stare at a wall.

41:13.925 --> 41:16.427
You start to see things.

41:16.461 --> 41:20.031
Your feet...
The pain in your feet...

41:21.766 --> 41:24.068
Well, it's an important job.

41:24.101 --> 41:25.269
No, it's not.

41:25.302 --> 41:26.971
You ever heard
of the vice president
getting assassinated?

41:27.004 --> 41:29.541
No. You know why?
It's never happened.

41:29.574 --> 41:31.242
Will it ever happen?
No way.

41:31.275 --> 41:33.945
Because who cares?

41:33.978 --> 41:35.780
Know what I mean?

41:41.152 --> 41:43.588
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:43.621 --> 41:46.491
as the republican national
committee student liaison

41:46.524 --> 41:48.593
for McKinley High School,

41:48.626 --> 41:50.795
I am honored
to present to you...

41:51.362 --> 41:53.064
(SNIFFS)

41:53.097 --> 41:56.133
The Vice President
of the United States
of America,

41:56.167 --> 41:57.669
George Bush.

41:57.702 --> 41:59.804
(BAND PLAYS <i>HAIL TO THE CHIEF</i>)

42:07.311 --> 42:09.714
Yeah, hail to the chief!

42:11.448 --> 42:13.685
This song rocks!

42:15.720 --> 42:18.089
You know, sometimes...
I mean, this sounds crazy...

42:18.122 --> 42:21.526
But sometimes I think
I just want to rip off
my vest and jacket

42:21.559 --> 42:23.227
and just put on a T‐shirt

42:23.260 --> 42:26.931
and go and, like,
make pancakes somewhere
or something.

42:26.964 --> 42:30.034
But, I mean, that
would be crazy, right?

42:30.067 --> 42:31.068
Hey...

42:31.669 --> 42:33.204
I've got a test

42:33.237 --> 42:36.273
which reveals
what type of job
you're best suited for.

42:36.307 --> 42:37.575
You want to take it?

42:38.209 --> 42:39.511
Ok.

42:40.277 --> 42:41.646
Thanks, Jeff.

42:44.549 --> 42:46.818
Uh, now we're going
to open up the floor

42:46.851 --> 42:49.186
so the Vice President
can take some questions

42:49.220 --> 42:50.822
from our student body.

42:50.855 --> 42:55.292
And our first question
comes from Ms. Lindsay Weir.

42:58.663 --> 43:00.297
Ms. Weir, go right ahead.

43:06.137 --> 43:09.674
Mr. Vice President,
my name is Lindsay Weir.

43:09.707 --> 43:13.911
My dad owns
A1 Sporting Goods
on 16 mile road.

43:14.646 --> 43:16.080
My question is...

43:18.115 --> 43:20.652
Why did your staff
reject my question?

43:20.685 --> 43:23.888
Are you afraid
of an open discourse
with the students?

43:23.921 --> 43:25.557
(MURMURING)

43:31.996 --> 43:33.164
Funny kid.

43:33.197 --> 43:35.132
One of McKinley's finest.

43:36.834 --> 43:39.203
"Do you like working
with major appliances?"

43:40.538 --> 43:41.839
That'd be a yes.
