17:01.979 --> 17:03.063
ME TOO.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.565
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOKED AT
THESE WOMEN IN THE FIRST YEAR,

17:04.647 --> 17:05.898
THEY WERE ALL ABOUT BOTOX

17:05.983 --> 17:07.943
AND MAKING SURE
THAT THEY HAD THE HIGHEST HEELS.

17:08.026 --> 17:09.611
Malick: YOU KNOW, WHAT WE'VE
ALL COME TO REALIZE IS,

17:09.694 --> 17:12.823
{\an8}AS IMPORTANT AS ALL OF THIS IS,
IT'S HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF

17:12.906 --> 17:14.657
AND HOW MUCH YOU ACCEPT
WHO YOU ARE

17:14.742 --> 17:18.037
AND DON'T GET TOO FREAKED OUT
ABOUT THE LITTLE IMPERFECTIONS.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.954
THERE'S SOMETHING
KIND OF WONDERFUL

17:20.038 --> 17:21.790
ABOUT ACCEPTING
THE AGE YOU ARE

17:21.874 --> 17:23.416
AND NOT FIGHTING IT
ALL THE TIME.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.961
IT CERTAINLY HELPED ME
TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF,

17:26.044 --> 17:27.921
AND I HOPE IT'S DONE THAT
FOR OTHER WOMEN, TOO.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.966
YOU'RE NOT OLD.
40 IS THE NEW 25.

17:31.049 --> 17:32.801
I THOUGHT
40 WAS THE NEW 30.

17:32.885 --> 17:36.180
{\an5}WELL, IF WE'RE JUST
GONNA MAKE CRAP UP,
I'D RATHER BE 25.

17:36.263 --> 17:39.099
ESSENTIALLY, THIS SHOW
HAS BEEN ABOUT GIRLFRIENDS.

17:39.183 --> 17:42.269
{\an4}IT'S THE ANTITHESIS OF
WHAT A LOT OF REALITY SHOWS
SAY ABOUT GIRLFRIENDS.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.480
THEY SAY THEY'RE GIRLFRIENDS
AND STAB EACH OTHER IN THE BACK.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.648
AAH! AAH!

17:46.732 --> 17:49.777
THIS IS WHAT
<i>REAL</i> GIRLFRIENDS ARE LIKE.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.612
YOU THOUGHT
LIBERACE WAS STRAIGHT?

17:51.695 --> 17:53.989
I COULD HAVE TURNED HIM.

17:54.072 --> 17:57.409
THE GREATEST LOVES
IN EACH OF OUR LIVES

17:57.493 --> 17:59.161
ARE REALLY EACH OTHER

17:59.244 --> 18:01.705
BECAUSE WE ARE ALWAYS THERE
FOR EACH OTHER.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.165
IMAGINE
WE HADN'T CRASHED HERE

18:03.248 --> 18:05.292
AND OUR FLIGHT HAD TAKEN US
STRAIGHT TO PARIS.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.961
WE WOULD HAVE EATEN
A LOT OF FATTY FRENCH FOOD,

18:08.045 --> 18:09.630
BOUGHT A LOT
OF DISCOUNT CHANEL,

18:09.713 --> 18:12.966
AND THEN FLOWN BACK
TO OUR EMPTY LIVES IN L.A.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.176
[ SIGHS ]

18:14.259 --> 18:16.553
All: DISCOUNT CHANEL.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.555
Malick: IT IS TRULY A FAMILY.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.558
WE ALL JUST FEEL SO PRIVILEGED
TO HAVE HAD THESE SIX SEASONS.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.977
MOST PEOPLE NEVER GET THIS
IN A LIFETIME.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.687
[ LAUGHTER ]

18:25.771 --> 18:27.481
IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE GIFT

18:27.564 --> 18:30.150
TO WORK WITH PEOPLE
I CONSIDER MY BEST FRIENDS.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.237
IT HAS BEEN THE NICEST,
KINDEST WORKING ENVIRONMENT

18:33.320 --> 18:36.740
FOR EVERYBODY
INVOLVED IN THE SHOW.

18:36.824 --> 18:40.202
{\an8}YOU CAN'T DO A SHOW LIKE THIS
WITH THE RAPPORT THAT WE HAVE

18:40.285 --> 18:41.870
THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME FAMILY,

18:41.954 --> 18:46.041
AND IT'S TOUGH WHEN YOU KNOW
THAT YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.668
Milliner:
I THINK EVERYBODY'S SAD.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.211
{\an5}WHEN WE'RE ON THE STAGE,
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO TALK ABOUT IT,

18:49.294 --> 18:50.420
{\an8}ESPECIALLY
IN FRONT OF VALERIE.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.255
{\an8}Shh, Shh.

18:51.338 --> 18:52.714
THE SHOW'S NOT ENDING.

18:52.798 --> 18:53.882
SHOW'S NOT ENDING.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.425
I KNOW HOW TO LIVE IN DENIAL.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.846
WE'RE TELLING OURSELVES
WE'RE GONNA WRITE A BOOK.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.347
THERE WILL BE NO BOOK,

19:00.430 --> 19:03.684
BUT IT WILL GIVE US A CHANCE
TO HAVE LUNCH TOGETHER

19:03.767 --> 19:05.227
TO DISCUSS "THE BOOK."

19:05.310 --> 19:07.187
{\an1}Hayes: THERE'S JUST A WARM,
FUZZY FEELING YOU GET

19:07.271 --> 19:08.397
WHEN YOU DRIVE
ON THE LOT

19:08.480 --> 19:10.524
{\an7}KNOWING YOU'LL RUN INTO
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.861
AND I DON'T WANT THEM TO TAKE
THAT SIGN DOWN ON THE STAGE.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.529
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

19:15.612 --> 19:18.615
THE GREAT CHALLENGE OF LIFE IS,
HOW DO YOU SAVOR EVERY DAY?

19:18.699 --> 19:22.202
WE'RE ALL TRYING TO COME IN
AND JUST NOT MISS ANY OF IT.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.787
Bertinelli:
IT'S BEEN SUCH A HAPPY RIDE.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.080
THEY'RE CAN'T BE ANY SADNESS.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.040
I MEAN, WE'VE HAD
THE TIME OF OUR LIVES

19:27.124 --> 19:29.376
FOR FIVE YEARS, SIX SEASONS.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.380
White: I REALLY THINK
THIS SHOW WILL GO DOWN

19:33.463 --> 19:35.382
AS ONE OF THE ONES TO REMEMBER.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.551
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US,

19:37.634 --> 19:39.553
I THINK THAT REACHES OUT
TO THE AUDIENCE,

19:39.636 --> 19:41.305
AND THAT'S WHAT
THEY'LL REMEMBER.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.807
Leeves: I HOPE PEOPLE
CAN TAKE AWAY FROM THIS

19:43.891 --> 19:45.225
THE JOY THAT WE'VE HAD HERE.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.935
THAT'S WHAT THIS SHOW IS ABOUT.

WHO'S BLOWING YOU.

HI, LOVER.

20:01.199 --> 20:03.285

THE SEX IS AMAZING.
