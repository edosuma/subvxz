WEBVTT

00:03.689 --> 00:06.487
All right, I can meet
with the Curson Foundation at noon,

00:06.649 --> 00:09.607
but then we'll have to move my 1:00
lunch regarding the Lowe estate.

00:09.809 --> 00:11.447
That will affect
my 2:30 slide presentation

00:11.649 --> 00:13.560
and my 4:30 meeting
with the new printers.

00:13.729 --> 00:15.082
Have you confirmed
Mrs Swanson yet?

00:15.249 --> 00:17.399
- The last Tae Bo class is at 7.
- Okay.

00:17.569 --> 00:21.118
I can meet the printers at their office,
walk to the Royal Hotel afterwards,

00:21.329 --> 00:22.887
for my 5:30 with Mrs Swanson.

00:23.049 --> 00:24.801
I just have enough time
for kickboxing class.

00:25.009 --> 00:27.603
Wait a minute, Mrs Swanson's
plane is delayed. She'll be in at 6.

00:27.769 --> 00:30.966
- Her plane doesn't arrive until 6?
- Well, so much for Tae Bo.

00:32.409 --> 00:35.287
- That's your phone. I will get it for you.
- Thanks, it's probably Jack.

00:35.449 --> 00:37.201
You don't have time for Jack,
literally.

00:38.249 --> 00:39.398
Prue Halliwell's phone.

00:39.609 --> 00:42.601
- This is Mr Caldwell's office.
- It's Mr Caldwell's office.

00:42.889 --> 00:46.962
It's the new VP. Monique, why
is Mr Caldwell calling me at home?

00:47.769 --> 00:50.363
What emergency staff meeting?

00:50.689 --> 00:53.487
- When this morning?
- Nine-thirty. Be there, or be fired.

00:54.009 --> 00:56.603
- I'm on my way!
- Bye.

00:57.049 --> 01:00.121
- I am very tired now. I need a nap.
- Yeah. Well, I need another me.

01:00.289 --> 01:02.439
I don't even have time
to have fun anymore.

01:03.529 --> 01:06.089
- Look who it is.
- Morning.

01:06.249 --> 01:10.083
- Hi. Do you recognise that person?
- Yeah, she looks vaguely familiar.

01:10.249 --> 01:13.127
Kind of like a sister that we used
to have. What was her name?

01:14.409 --> 01:17.606
- Pipper?
- No. Whatever happened to her?

01:17.769 --> 01:20.203
I don't know. She fell in lust
with the next-door neighbour,

01:20.369 --> 01:22.166
started spending all of her time there.

01:22.329 --> 01:24.479
That's because she could.
For the first time in months,

01:24.649 --> 01:26.844
her life was nice
and calm and normal.

01:27.009 --> 01:28.442
I don't even care that it's Friday...

01:30.089 --> 01:31.841
Don't even say it.

01:32.009 --> 01:35.797
The 13th. See, I said it,
and nothing happened.

01:43.929 --> 01:47.285
- I told you not to say it!
- So this is my fault?

01:47.449 --> 01:49.007
- Run!
- No!

01:49.169 --> 01:50.841
Get your butt over here right now!

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:05.929 --> 02:09.285
- Like I need this today.
- Since when do demons use bullets?

02:09.489 --> 02:11.923
- Maybe it's not a demon.
- Who else would wanna kill us?

02:12.089 --> 02:14.683
Well, you know, you were a little sharp
to the mailman yesterday.

02:14.849 --> 02:16.726
We all know how testy they can be.

02:19.249 --> 02:20.967
- Freeze.
- Kick.

02:21.129 --> 02:22.642
- Send flying.
- Okay.

02:56.449 --> 02:58.201
Oh, my God, she's not a demon.

04:40.369 --> 04:42.280
Multiple aliases.

04:43.409 --> 04:45.001
Foreign currency.

04:45.209 --> 04:47.006
And throwing stars?

04:49.649 --> 04:51.844
Not exactly Avon calling.

04:53.289 --> 04:55.200
"Sutro Heights Apartments."

04:55.369 --> 04:57.280
That's scary,
she didn't live too far from here.

04:57.449 --> 04:58.598
Well, what's even scarier

04:58.769 --> 05:00.805
is we've never been attacked
by a mortal before.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.806
Yeah,
I never killed a mortal before either.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.961
- Prue, you had no choice.
- Still doesn't make it any easier.

05:06.129 --> 05:09.405
Does it make it easier
if the mortal was a hit woman?

05:10.729 --> 05:13.846
- A list of names, so...
- Yeah, look closer.

05:14.009 --> 05:15.965
We're on it, or at least one of us is.

05:16.129 --> 05:18.518
P. Halliwell,
and other than an M. Steadwell,

05:18.689 --> 05:21.078
we're the only other name
not crossed off.

05:21.249 --> 05:24.161
A hit woman.
Someone obviously hired her.

05:24.929 --> 05:27.841
Someone who knew
that we had powers. I mean, look.

05:28.049 --> 05:32.725
"Prue: Telekinesis. Piper: Power
to freeze. Phoebe: Negligible."

05:33.809 --> 05:35.845
What? Negligible?

05:36.009 --> 05:39.126
Well, that explains why
she drove us to the front door

05:39.289 --> 05:40.927
and surprised us from behind.

05:41.089 --> 05:45.241
Still, why would a demon hire a mortal
to kill us? It doesn't make any sense.

05:45.409 --> 05:49.163
I just wish we knew about that part
of the equation before we called...

05:51.809 --> 05:53.401
Darryl, hi. Thanks for coming.

05:54.009 --> 05:57.126
To tell you the truth,
I'm not sure I actually wanna be here.

05:57.289 --> 05:59.883
Depends on whether or not
you actually tell me the truth this time.

06:00.049 --> 06:03.166
- Someone tried to kill us.
- You see who it was?

06:04.289 --> 06:06.723
- She's in there.
- She?

06:12.089 --> 06:14.444
We were just sort of
standing here, talking,

06:14.609 --> 06:16.406
and suddenly she started
shooting up the place.

06:16.569 --> 06:17.968
A hit woman, we think.

06:18.129 --> 06:21.007
Who obviously wanted us dead.
We were on her list.

06:21.369 --> 06:23.280
And that's why you're
standing here alive,

06:23.449 --> 06:25.121
and she's in here riddled
with bullets?

06:25.329 --> 06:28.241
Darryl, it was self-defence. You can
check her gun if you don't believe us.

06:28.409 --> 06:30.718
The only fingerprints
that you're gonna find on it are hers.

06:31.289 --> 06:33.644
Begs the same question.

06:33.969 --> 06:37.359
How come she's got the bullets
in her body if you didn't fire the gun?

06:41.049 --> 06:43.279
Do you really wanna know, Darryl?

06:45.929 --> 06:47.806
Tell me.

06:51.889 --> 06:54.483
We're witches. We...

06:55.129 --> 06:56.482
We have powers.

06:56.809 --> 07:00.085
And we think that there's a...
How do I put this?

07:00.769 --> 07:02.248
A demon behind this.

07:02.769 --> 07:06.398
The only way for us to find out
who it is is if you can keep all of this

07:06.569 --> 07:08.560
quiet for as long as possible.

07:11.169 --> 07:12.807
Let me see the book.

07:13.649 --> 07:15.287
There are nine names
that are crossed out.

07:15.449 --> 07:18.361
Besides us, there's only one
other name that's not crossed out.

07:18.529 --> 07:21.919
"Plastique, 10 a.m."
Plastic explosives.

07:22.089 --> 07:24.523
For all we know, she's already got
someplace rigged to blow.

07:24.729 --> 07:27.960
Maybe it's someplace M. Steadwell's
supposed to be at at 10.

07:28.129 --> 07:30.438
Okay, well, it's after 9 already.

07:30.609 --> 07:32.281
I'll check DMV,
see if I can get an address.

07:32.449 --> 07:33.438
I'm gonna go with you.

07:33.609 --> 07:35.122
Then Prue and I can go
to her apartment

07:35.289 --> 07:36.722
and see if we can find
anything there.

07:36.889 --> 07:39.084
After we make
a quick pit stop at Buckland's.

07:39.249 --> 07:41.001
- Are you kidding?
- I can't lose my job.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.125
Hey, what do we do with the...?

07:43.329 --> 07:45.797
I can call in a favour
and put the body on ice,

07:45.969 --> 07:49.359
but that's not gonna buy you
much time. One day, max.

07:56.809 --> 08:00.006
As the new regional VP
of Buckland's auction houses,

08:00.409 --> 08:03.640
I'll be implementing a new course
of action for a new millennium.

08:04.209 --> 08:05.608
The problem is,

08:05.769 --> 08:08.886
I don't know any of you well enough
to know who's worth keeping.

08:09.129 --> 08:10.562
And who's not.

08:10.729 --> 08:14.005
- You're late, partner.
- We are not partners.

08:14.169 --> 08:16.603
- Do you wanna bet?
- You, dark hair.

08:17.129 --> 08:20.201
Yeah, the one who tried to sneak
in late. What's your name?

08:20.649 --> 08:25.848
My name? Prue... Prue Halliwell.

08:27.249 --> 08:28.682
Yeah, right.

08:29.169 --> 08:31.399
Okay, you'll be partnered
with Sheridan there.

08:32.009 --> 08:35.717
Every employee in this room
and their partner

08:36.089 --> 08:38.808
has until tomorrow night
to scour through the obits,

08:38.969 --> 08:44.202
do whatever you have to do
to raise $100,000 of auction material.

08:44.369 --> 08:46.405
- Yes?
- By tomorrow?

08:46.569 --> 08:48.639
If you wanna keep your job.

08:48.849 --> 08:51.283
Welcome to the new Buckland's.

08:54.449 --> 08:57.680
Whoa, I guess we better
clear the decks, huh?

08:59.209 --> 09:01.006
Prue, we might even have
to work over dinner.

09:01.209 --> 09:03.120
- Dinner, no. L...
- Come on.

09:03.329 --> 09:05.240
- We're in this together, aren't we?
- Yeah, but...

09:08.569 --> 09:10.082
Prue?

09:11.889 --> 09:13.208
Prue?

09:22.969 --> 09:26.439
Prue, have you even heard
a word I've said?

09:27.969 --> 09:30.722
No. I'm feeling a little...

09:32.489 --> 09:33.922
...weird.

09:34.849 --> 09:36.328
I'll be...

09:38.849 --> 09:40.328
What the hell just happened?

09:40.889 --> 09:43.483
I don't know.
I think it was some sort of a...

09:43.849 --> 09:46.204
...astral projection.
- How did you do it?

09:46.369 --> 09:48.929
I just felt this sort of desperate need
for there to be two of me,

09:49.089 --> 09:50.317
and all of a sudden, there was.

09:50.489 --> 09:52.525
Do you think this is part
of your powers growing?

09:52.689 --> 09:56.125
Maybe. I mean, if I can move things
with my mind, why not my body?

09:56.289 --> 09:58.757
Well, let's just get out of here
before it happens again.

10:02.489 --> 10:05.401
Hey, you know, you can ask me
anything you want about being a witch.

10:05.569 --> 10:06.558
No, thanks.

10:06.729 --> 10:09.243
It's really cool. We have this book
called the Book of Shadows.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.762
- Too much information.
- But it's...

10:10.929 --> 10:13.841
Nothing I wanna know about. I'm
serious. I don't wanna know anything.

10:14.009 --> 10:16.125
Come on, you don't even want
to know if we, like,

10:16.289 --> 10:17.688
can fly or anything like that?

10:17.849 --> 10:20.488
I don't even wanna know if you own
a broom, a skillet, a cauldron,

10:20.649 --> 10:22.287
a DustBuster.
I don't give a damn!

10:25.129 --> 10:28.485
Phoebe, I stare down death
every day.

10:28.649 --> 10:30.765
But I'm trained to handle it.
And that's in this world.

10:30.929 --> 10:32.487
I don't know if I wanna be dragged
into another.

10:32.689 --> 10:34.964
You know, I think it's too late, Darryl.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.243
But we won't let anything happen
to you, I promise.

10:39.209 --> 10:40.767
Are you sure this is
the right address?

10:40.929 --> 10:43.204
Better hope so. It's the only
M. Steadwell registered.

10:43.369 --> 10:44.597
Damn, it's almost 10:00.

10:53.489 --> 10:55.047
Is that her?

10:58.449 --> 10:59.768
No, don't!

10:59.969 --> 11:01.004
No!

11:09.249 --> 11:12.798
- My God! Everybody okay?
- Yeah.

11:13.009 --> 11:15.204
- Are you okay, Ms Steadwell?
- It worked.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.881
I can't believe it.

11:18.089 --> 11:21.047
I cast a protection spell,
and it actually worked.

11:21.209 --> 11:23.439
My first spell.

11:25.169 --> 11:26.682
Don't tell me she's a witch too.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.441
Look at this place.

11:45.849 --> 11:50.127
Lalique fixtures, silk-woven rugs. I
could get used to living here in a hurry.

11:50.289 --> 11:53.008
Yeah, you just have to know who
to kill. I'm gonna check the kitchen.

11:53.169 --> 11:54.761
All right. I'll get the bedroom.

12:05.929 --> 12:09.717
Oh, my. Faux. Nice.

12:51.689 --> 12:55.238
She must not have lived here long.
All the mail is marked "resident."

12:55.409 --> 12:58.162
- Were you twirling?
- No.

12:58.489 --> 13:03.517
But opportunity knocked, and I did
answer. Check out this wardrobe.

13:03.689 --> 13:05.520
- Prue, honey, focus.
- I can't.

13:05.689 --> 13:10.524
It's not just the clothes. Wigs, makeup
kits, prosthetic enhancements.

13:10.689 --> 13:12.805
I wonder if anybody knew
what she really looked like?

13:12.969 --> 13:15.563
- I doubt it.
- And if it weren't for the roses,

13:15.769 --> 13:17.248
we wouldn't even know
what to call her.

13:17.409 --> 13:19.047
- What roses?
- They're in the living room,

13:19.209 --> 13:20.642
addressed to Ms Hellfire.

13:21.169 --> 13:22.522
Really?

13:29.169 --> 13:31.239
"Until we meet at last. Bane."

13:32.409 --> 13:35.401
Don't move.
Don't even flinch, or you're dead.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.560
That's it. Now slowly turn around.

13:38.729 --> 13:41.527
Watch her hands. She can kill you
with them in a second.

13:41.689 --> 13:43.327
Ms Hellfire, I presume.

13:45.529 --> 13:48.202
- You Bane?
- His right-hand man, DJ.

13:50.009 --> 13:53.319
Bane is very unhappy with you.
He'd like to see you now.

13:56.809 --> 14:00.279
Okay, sorry to disappoint you, boys.
Let's go, get out of here, come on.

14:00.449 --> 14:03.009
You know, they think I'm Hellfire.

14:03.329 --> 14:05.160
- So?
- So maybe I should go with them.

14:05.329 --> 14:08.366
I mean, maybe the best way to find out
who hired her is to pretend to be her.

14:09.169 --> 14:11.444
- Okay, that's very funny, let's go.
- Piper, I'm serious.

14:11.649 --> 14:14.083
You said yourself that nobody
knows what she looks like.

14:14.249 --> 14:15.523
Certainly not this Bane guy.

14:15.769 --> 14:18.044
Well, Prue, somebody might know
what she looks like.

14:18.209 --> 14:21.360
Yeah, but I can protect myself. I mean,
I have something that they don't have,

14:21.529 --> 14:24.646
something that guns
can't even compete with.

14:25.329 --> 14:28.048
Today may not be the best day
to boast about your powers.

14:28.209 --> 14:30.882
Okay, look, if this hit woman
was hired by a demon,

14:31.049 --> 14:33.768
then it's only a matter of time
before he finds out that P. Halliwell

14:33.929 --> 14:37.478
is still alive and send someone else.
So we have to do something.

14:37.689 --> 14:41.602
I mean, if you got any better ideas,
I'm certainly game.

14:41.889 --> 14:46.167
- I know, and unfortunately, I don't.
- Okay, so unfreeze them.

14:46.809 --> 14:50.119
Is it just me, or are you
a little too eager to play this role?

14:50.289 --> 14:52.280
- It's not a bad role to play.
- True.

14:52.449 --> 14:54.599
- If you wanna get yourself...
- I'll be fine.

14:58.889 --> 15:00.447
You gonna make this easy or not?

15:00.609 --> 15:02.804
Put that thing away
before you hurt yourself.

15:18.329 --> 15:22.208
I swear to God, Bane.
I tried to get the money for you,

15:22.729 --> 15:24.606
but I messed up. I messed up.

15:24.769 --> 15:27.203
I was scared. I didn't know
how you were gonna react.

15:27.369 --> 15:28.688
You lied to me.

15:28.849 --> 15:31.124
- I didn't know. I didn't know.
- You made a mistake.

15:31.329 --> 15:33.320
And you're sorry for it, right?

15:33.649 --> 15:35.879
Right. Yeah.

15:36.049 --> 15:38.927
Well, lesson learned, all right?
Just never lie to me again.

15:39.089 --> 15:41.728
- Understood?
- Thank you.

15:51.729 --> 15:53.720
Well...

15:54.129 --> 15:56.245
You are more beautiful
than I imagined.

15:56.449 --> 15:57.962
And we finally meet.

15:58.929 --> 16:00.726
Did you like the roses?

16:01.129 --> 16:03.199
I would have preferred orchids.

16:03.929 --> 16:06.648
Beautiful and honest.

16:09.609 --> 16:12.726
Let's take a walk.
You know what to bring.

16:16.049 --> 16:17.767
What do I call you?

16:18.369 --> 16:20.280
What you always call me.

16:20.489 --> 16:23.128
Ms Hellfire seems so cold in person.

16:23.329 --> 16:27.038
Unless your e-mails to me
have just been a tease.

16:27.289 --> 16:30.167
- I think you know me better than that.
- Do I?

16:30.369 --> 16:32.803
You didn't confirm
the Halliwells this morning.

16:34.609 --> 16:36.122
I didn't have a clean shot.

16:37.129 --> 16:41.202
Well, that's disappointing.
What about the last one on the list?

16:41.569 --> 16:42.888
Steadwell?

16:44.609 --> 16:46.679
It was a blast.

16:48.569 --> 16:51.322
I like your style. I always have.

16:51.489 --> 16:53.445
The problem is, you still got
the Halliwells,

16:53.609 --> 16:56.203
but you only got until midnight
to take them out.

17:01.929 --> 17:04.443
Don't worry about the Halliwells.
I know their every move.

17:04.608 --> 17:06.645
I'm getting a lot of pressure,
you know.

17:06.809 --> 17:08.959
- From who?
- You know who.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.087
Of course.

17:17.449 --> 17:18.882
Aren't you gonna answer that?

17:20.368 --> 17:21.768
Yeah.

17:22.689 --> 17:24.406
- Hello.
- Hey.

17:24.569 --> 17:26.958
What happened to you this morning?
You completely disappeared.

17:27.128 --> 17:31.088
- I'm with a client.
- Yeah, well, that better be a rich client.

17:31.369 --> 17:34.042
- Time is money.
- Champagne?

17:35.169 --> 17:37.285
Champagne, at this hour?
Where are you?

17:37.449 --> 17:38.768
- Me?
- To us.

17:39.609 --> 17:41.884
Hey, Prue, you know me,
I'm all for a good time.

17:42.049 --> 17:43.721
But we're under
some serious pressure here.

17:43.889 --> 17:45.083
Yeah, I know...

17:48.569 --> 17:50.480
- Are you there?
- Oh, God.

17:50.689 --> 17:52.680
Prue.

17:56.969 --> 17:59.119
You all right? What happened?

17:59.449 --> 18:01.041
Prue, what the hell is going on?

18:02.129 --> 18:03.960
I'll call you back.

18:13.129 --> 18:14.244
Sorry.

18:14.609 --> 18:16.600
Maybe you better hold off
on this one, huh?

18:16.769 --> 18:18.680
At least until the job is completed.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.966
Guess I'd better be going.

18:24.609 --> 18:26.122
You're not going anywhere.

18:26.849 --> 18:28.521
Not without my driving you.

18:35.729 --> 18:38.038
- Tell him I'm on it.
- Wait a minute, why me?

18:38.209 --> 18:39.608
I don't even know the guy.

18:39.769 --> 18:43.318
You will. Just go to my office.
He'll show, okay?

18:58.249 --> 19:00.046
Looking for me?

19:01.729 --> 19:05.085
- Where in the hell did you come from?
- You really don't wanna know.

19:05.249 --> 19:08.002
Trust me.
Why aren't the witches dead?

19:08.169 --> 19:10.637
- Witches?
- Answer me.

19:11.529 --> 19:13.087
How did you know
they weren't dead?

19:13.289 --> 19:15.200
One develops a...

19:16.329 --> 19:20.038
...sixth sense about such things
when you've been

19:20.449 --> 19:22.679
in purgatory as long as I have.

19:23.769 --> 19:27.000
Never mind. I made a deal.

19:27.289 --> 19:31.965
It gives me a 24-hour window
to break free. But now, you people,

19:32.209 --> 19:36.407
you gotta kill those witches
if I'm going to be successful.

19:37.609 --> 19:38.758
Who are you?

19:39.449 --> 19:40.677
A demon.

19:42.129 --> 19:45.007
A demon who has the power.

19:46.529 --> 19:50.807
A power to turn the innermost fears
of a mortal into reality.

19:51.009 --> 19:53.921
And there's nothing you can do
about it.

19:54.089 --> 19:55.317
Want to see?

19:59.169 --> 20:01.205
Your greatest fear

20:01.409 --> 20:03.877
is that your boss
is being double-crossed.

20:04.049 --> 20:07.837
And when he finds out, he's going
to kill you for not protecting him.

20:23.369 --> 20:25.280
Pretty cool, huh?

20:31.329 --> 20:35.038
I can have my crew install some
temporary windows sometime tonight.

20:35.209 --> 20:36.961
Great, thanks.

20:38.289 --> 20:40.200
You waiting for a call?

20:41.449 --> 20:44.088
Yeah. I'm just a little worried
about Prue.

20:45.009 --> 20:47.125
I don't blame you
after what happened.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.519
What makes you think
it was a drive-by?

20:50.769 --> 20:53.158
I don't know, wild guess, I guess.

20:54.129 --> 20:55.721
I want you to move in with me.

20:57.489 --> 21:00.447
At least until
the permanent windows are installed.

21:00.609 --> 21:03.248
If it's your sisters you're worried about,
they can move in too.

21:04.129 --> 21:05.608
Since Jenny moved back
with her folks,

21:05.769 --> 21:08.203
there's just plenty of room.

21:08.729 --> 21:13.439
I don't know if that's such a great idea.
Some of us don't wear pyjamas.

21:14.329 --> 21:16.479
I'm serious.

21:16.689 --> 21:20.807
Because if things worked out,
maybe you could stay.

21:22.729 --> 21:26.165
Permanently. If you wanted to.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.042
- Piper?
- In here!

21:31.249 --> 21:33.080
I don't know what to say.

21:33.409 --> 21:35.001
Say you'll think about it.

21:38.169 --> 21:40.046
Is he a wi...?

21:43.969 --> 21:47.598
- Who's she?
- Would you believe M. Steadwell?

21:48.009 --> 21:50.364
- How's Dan?
- Just asked me to move in.

21:50.529 --> 21:52.042
- Where's Morris?
- He's at the morgue,

21:52.249 --> 21:54.479
putting the hit woman's body
under Marcie's name.

21:54.649 --> 21:56.241
- Where's Prue?
- Way overdue.

21:56.409 --> 21:58.161
She's assuming
the identity of the hit woman.

21:58.329 --> 21:59.808
- What?
- Yeah, and guess what.

21:59.969 --> 22:02.278
She's got a new power.
She can astral project now.

22:02.489 --> 22:03.968
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

22:04.169 --> 22:05.284
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

22:05.489 --> 22:07.002
- I hate her!
- I know.

22:07.689 --> 22:09.168
All right, I'm gonna send Dan home.

22:09.369 --> 22:11.360
You keep Marcie in the house
until this is all over.

22:11.529 --> 22:13.360
- Yeah, all right. Then we'll talk.
- Yeah.

22:17.809 --> 22:20.403
Well, thanks for the...

22:22.929 --> 22:24.248
...ride.

22:30.249 --> 22:33.082
You say you preferred orchids.

22:36.129 --> 22:39.246
- I'm impressed.
- I'm glad.

22:41.089 --> 22:42.886
Now close your eyes.

22:45.409 --> 22:46.888
Trust me.

22:52.969 --> 22:54.243
Go ahead, open them.

22:56.129 --> 22:58.006
And open this when I leave, okay?

22:58.369 --> 23:01.645
But remember,
three Halliwells by midnight.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.041
On second thought, make it by 10.

23:04.209 --> 23:06.769
It gives me more time
to take care of it myself,

23:07.089 --> 23:08.488
in case you fail.

23:34.969 --> 23:36.448
Wait a minute,
you can't come in here.

23:36.609 --> 23:38.679
Bet you.

23:41.689 --> 23:42.804
What do you want?

23:43.129 --> 23:47.008
Why, your greatest fear,
of course, which...

23:50.849 --> 23:53.204
...is being autopsied yourself.

24:17.009 --> 24:20.797
Doesn't look much
like an explosion victim to me.

24:21.609 --> 24:26.524
I think your fears
of a double-cross are justified.

24:39.049 --> 24:41.085
Oh, my stars!

24:41.849 --> 24:43.487
What is it? What's wrong?

24:43.649 --> 24:47.085
You can't keep wolfsbane
and holy thistle on the same shelf.

24:47.249 --> 24:49.160
Their harmonics
are in complete opposition.

24:49.729 --> 24:53.438
I mean, I don't wanna second-guess
a sister witch, but this is all wrong.

24:53.609 --> 24:56.248
I don't see how you can cast a spell
that's worth a darn.

24:56.409 --> 24:58.843
Now, wait just a minute, missy.

24:59.849 --> 25:03.125
Oh, my God. Prue's home, I think.

25:03.609 --> 25:05.645
That's Prue, all right.

25:11.129 --> 25:14.246
Gee, Prue, looks like being
a hired killer agrees with you.

25:14.409 --> 25:16.877
I didn't wanna run the risk
of anyone seeing me out of uniform.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.402
We've been worried sick about you.

25:18.569 --> 25:20.764
I'm sorry, I just didn't wanna
jeopardise my cover.

25:21.409 --> 25:24.640
- Nice cover.
- And nice Porsche. A gift from Bane?

25:25.209 --> 25:27.518
No, Bane prefers...

25:28.929 --> 25:29.998
Never mind.

25:30.449 --> 25:32.599
Look, I need to get back
before they get suspicious.

25:32.769 --> 25:35.124
- Tell me what you know.
- We know M. Steadwell is safe.

25:35.289 --> 25:38.440
- Can't say the same for the kitchen.
- Any idea why she was on the list?

25:38.609 --> 25:41.043
Could be because she's a witch.
I mean, not a magical witch,

25:41.209 --> 25:44.599
- but a witch practitioner nonetheless.
- A hyperactive witch practitioner.

25:44.769 --> 25:47.329
I wonder if all the names were witches.
How many were on the list?

25:47.769 --> 25:50.966
Eleven. Except that P. Halliwell
was only down once.

25:51.129 --> 25:52.642
So if you count us individually...

25:53.409 --> 25:55.320
...13.
- Thirteen dead witches

25:55.529 --> 25:58.487
by midnight on Friday the 13th.
Ring any bells?

25:58.689 --> 26:00.725
- Barbas.
- Gotta be.

26:00.929 --> 26:02.999
It can't be.
I mean, we eighty-sixed him already.

26:03.369 --> 26:04.961
He must have found
some kind of loophole.

26:05.129 --> 26:07.597
I've gotta get back to Bane,
try and flush Barbas out.

26:07.769 --> 26:09.407
Prue, you can't go back there.

26:09.889 --> 26:13.325
Piper, it's almost 8.
I have gotta get to Barbas fast.

26:13.489 --> 26:16.561
Otherwise, Bane's gonna wanna
see three bodies, our bodies.

26:17.049 --> 26:18.323
Have fun.

26:18.569 --> 26:21.879
- Phoebe, I'm working.
- More like you're working it.

26:22.049 --> 26:25.758
Come on, Prue, I've taken a walk
on the dark side. I know all the signs.

26:25.929 --> 26:27.806
Okay, so it's a little different.

26:27.969 --> 26:29.925
- And dangerous.
- I can handle it.

26:30.089 --> 26:33.126
Prue, Barbas can paralyse you
and use your greatest fear against you.

26:33.289 --> 26:34.927
You don't want to face that alone.

26:35.089 --> 26:38.161
How? I already conquered my fear
of drowning. What else can he do?

26:38.409 --> 26:42.118
Well, maybe tap into some other fear.
You can't defeat him alone, Prue.

26:42.289 --> 26:44.598
I know that.
But for now, I'll be okay.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.964
I'll call you guys
and check in in an hour.

27:21.889 --> 27:23.880
You look like you're ready
to celebrate.

27:24.049 --> 27:27.041
- Are the Halliwells dead?
- The night's young.

27:27.329 --> 27:29.763
We have a little bit
of business to discuss.

27:29.969 --> 27:33.245
- What, all work and no play?
- We'll play...

27:33.689 --> 27:38.126
...right after I get my money.
- You'll get paid when they're dead.

27:39.569 --> 27:41.525
You know, the boss has
a nasty little habit

27:41.689 --> 27:43.680
of disappearing
in the middle of the night.

27:44.089 --> 27:46.683
I'd hate for my money
to disappear with him.

27:47.129 --> 27:49.165
Can I trust you? And Barbas?

27:49.329 --> 27:51.684
I'm disappointed
you doubt either one of us.

27:51.849 --> 27:53.521
I wanna talk to him.

27:54.329 --> 27:57.287
Well, like you said,
the night is young.

28:34.569 --> 28:37.288
- DJ, what's your problem?
- I need to talk to you.

28:37.969 --> 28:40.005
Better be life and death.

28:41.329 --> 28:42.887
Excuse me.

28:45.409 --> 28:47.320
I'll just amuse myself.

28:48.609 --> 28:50.247
- Hi.
- Hey.

28:54.169 --> 28:55.488
Make it fast.

28:56.449 --> 28:59.088
- I just came from the morgue.
- Looking for a date?

28:59.249 --> 29:02.844
- No, checking on yours. She's a fraud.
- What are you talking about?

29:03.009 --> 29:04.601
Marcie Steadwell isn't
in the morgue,

29:04.769 --> 29:07.237
and I think the real Ms Hellfire is.

29:12.889 --> 29:16.438
- I don't believe it.
- Barbas believes it.

29:29.169 --> 29:30.966
Marcie, please.

29:31.169 --> 29:35.720
Favour us, Sister Moon
With your protective beams

29:35.969 --> 29:37.197
Please stop.

29:37.369 --> 29:43.808
Give all who dwell within this spell
Safe days and sweet dreams

29:43.969 --> 29:45.766
Okay, that's all folks.

29:45.929 --> 29:48.079
Who knew perky
could be so annoying?

29:48.249 --> 29:49.921
How long you think
I can keep her like this?

29:50.129 --> 29:53.007
Your power, your call.
Hey, did you reach Prue?

29:53.209 --> 29:55.120
No, she's still not answering her cell.

29:55.329 --> 29:57.763
She really should
have checked in by now.

29:58.569 --> 30:00.446
- Maybe that's her.
- Ringing the bell?

30:00.649 --> 30:02.287
Well, maybe she lost her keys.

30:02.489 --> 30:04.605
Right, Marcie?

30:06.809 --> 30:08.606
- Dan!
- Hey, Piper.

30:08.849 --> 30:09.918
Dan, wait...

30:10.089 --> 30:12.205
I wanted to bring this over
and leave it for my crew.

30:12.369 --> 30:14.121
They're having trouble
finding enough plywood.

30:14.289 --> 30:16.041
- Hey, Phoebe.
- Hey, Dan.

30:16.969 --> 30:19.767
Piper, don't forget about the...

30:19.969 --> 30:21.687
- Is this not a good time?
- Never. I mean,

30:21.889 --> 30:25.768
always. Why don't you come in.
Come on back.

30:26.049 --> 30:27.402
- Here let me help you.
- No, Piper.

30:27.569 --> 30:29.605
- No, I got it, really.
- Piper, I got it. Piper!

30:37.289 --> 30:41.282
For those who dwell
Underneath this roof

30:41.809 --> 30:45.006
Okay, you know, Marcie,
there's lots of rooms

30:45.169 --> 30:47.125
that need protecting upstairs.

30:47.689 --> 30:49.680
Wait a minute, where did Piper go?

30:49.849 --> 30:52.238
Oh, she just cast a little spell
of her own.

30:54.369 --> 30:56.929
Lots of rooms upstairs, honey.
Quietly, quietly.

31:00.729 --> 31:03.846
- So how are you doing?
- Fine, it wasn't that heavy.

31:04.049 --> 31:06.643
No, I'm talking about everything.

31:07.369 --> 31:11.408
Oh, I'm fine with that too.
I'm actually a little stressed.

31:11.569 --> 31:13.048
But everything is gonna be okay.

31:13.689 --> 31:16.078
So have you thought
any more about my offer?

31:18.409 --> 31:20.639
You know, I don't want to push you.

31:21.409 --> 31:22.888
I know, it's just,

31:23.089 --> 31:25.398
every time I think
I have things figured out,

31:25.569 --> 31:27.446
things tend to shift.

31:28.209 --> 31:30.279
Well, what things?

31:31.169 --> 31:35.367
Hey, you just let me know
when you're ready.

31:58.969 --> 32:02.928
You know, it's not midnight yet.
We still have time. Lots of time.

32:03.089 --> 32:06.161
You think you could fool me
and get away with it?

32:06.369 --> 32:08.564
- You killed the woman I loved.
- What are you saying?

32:08.769 --> 32:10.646
- You killed Hellfire!
- I am Hellfire.

32:10.809 --> 32:12.401
Liar!

32:13.689 --> 32:18.365
So very nice
to see you again, Miss Halliwell.

32:19.689 --> 32:22.408
Halliwell? From the list?

32:22.569 --> 32:26.118
Well, well, well.
Can't say that I'm surprised.

32:26.329 --> 32:29.241
Your greatest fear
is that someone will kill your sisters.

32:29.409 --> 32:31.559
- No.
- Oh, yes.

32:31.729 --> 32:34.243
The demons are after them.

32:34.449 --> 32:36.485
Even as we speak,

32:36.649 --> 32:41.279
they have assumed your sisters'
identities in order to kill them.

32:41.969 --> 32:44.767
You must kill the impostors first,

32:44.929 --> 32:46.328
by midnight.

32:47.289 --> 32:50.520
- Kill the impostors.
- Yes.

32:51.169 --> 32:52.727
Then I get to deal with her.

33:04.489 --> 33:05.842
- Hey, Darryl.
- Phoebe.

33:06.049 --> 33:07.448
Come on in.

33:08.889 --> 33:12.598
Thanks for coming so fast.
We need you to babysit.

33:12.849 --> 33:15.443
- Is this one breathing?
- Yes, this one is breathing.

33:15.609 --> 33:16.928
Good. Where are you headed?

33:17.089 --> 33:20.081
To find Prue.
She's impersonating the hit woman.

33:20.249 --> 33:22.001
- What?
- It's a long story,

33:22.169 --> 33:25.047
and you wouldn't like it, but she
was supposed to check in by now.

33:25.209 --> 33:27.643
- I'm going with you.
- No, no. No, you can't.

33:27.809 --> 33:29.765
I appreciate it,
but you can't come with us.

33:29.969 --> 33:32.608
You don't have to hide
anything from me anymore.

33:32.769 --> 33:33.918
I know that, Darryl,

33:34.089 --> 33:36.603
but believe me, you don't wanna
be anywhere near us right now.

33:36.769 --> 33:39.158
We would never forgive ourselves
if anything happened to you.

33:39.329 --> 33:42.127
- I won't wind up like Andy.
- We won't let that happen.

33:42.289 --> 33:46.726
Which cleanses the aura of the house
and makes it strong.

33:46.929 --> 33:49.284
Give me strength. Hi, Darryl.

33:49.449 --> 33:51.883
Piper. You're gonna have to come
with me, Miss Steadwell.

33:52.049 --> 33:54.517
Okay. Thanks for everything,
Marcie. Bye-bye.

33:54.689 --> 33:56.805
Oh, is this about
the explosion at my shop?

33:56.969 --> 34:00.006
Yes. Until we close the case,
you'd be safer with me.

34:00.169 --> 34:03.127
Oh, I think you have
that backwards, inspector.

34:03.329 --> 34:04.887
You see, the protection spell
I cast

34:05.049 --> 34:07.688
has been doing such a bang-up job
for these girls.

34:07.849 --> 34:11.239
Just think what it could do for you.

34:13.208 --> 34:15.768
Okay, well, we thank you
for that protection spell.

34:15.929 --> 34:17.998
Thank you so much,
and now we have to go now.

34:18.168 --> 34:19.487
Okay.

34:19.649 --> 34:23.244
Come, inspector,
my work here is done.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.320
Why don't we just leave this here.

34:33.809 --> 34:35.879
Are you sure that was the Porsche
parked out front?

34:36.049 --> 34:39.166
- Positive. Prue's here somewhere.
- Let's just hope she's alone.

34:42.129 --> 34:44.085
- Prue.
- We've been so worried.

34:46.129 --> 34:47.164
Prue!

34:52.449 --> 34:54.007
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not!

34:54.208 --> 34:57.565
Come on. Crazy sister. Crazy sister.
Easy, easy.

34:57.809 --> 35:01.438
- What is going on?
- I think you need to freeze her fast.

35:01.609 --> 35:02.962
Good witches don't freeze,
remember?

35:03.129 --> 35:04.926
She doesn't look so good right now.

35:05.129 --> 35:06.721
I won't let you kill my sisters.

35:09.609 --> 35:12.362
- She flipped out.
- Patio, fast. Come on.

35:24.489 --> 35:27.640
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing? Don't, don't.

35:30.529 --> 35:31.882
She doesn't know we're her sisters.

35:32.049 --> 35:34.563
Okay, we gotta make her choose.
We have to convince astral Prue.

35:34.729 --> 35:36.640
Make her wanna be
in two places at once. Ready?

35:36.809 --> 35:38.367
- Yeah.
- Okay, go.

35:41.009 --> 35:42.806
Hi.

35:43.569 --> 35:45.719
Come on, Prue, come get me.
Come on.

35:45.929 --> 35:47.408
No, it's me you want, over here.

35:48.089 --> 35:51.001
- No, Prudence, come on, me.
- No, me.

35:54.289 --> 35:55.768
Phoebe!

35:58.369 --> 36:00.929
Phoebe, we need to hurry
before she becomes one again.

36:04.049 --> 36:05.448
Phoebe!

36:06.249 --> 36:09.685
Prue, Barbas has brainwashed you.

36:09.849 --> 36:11.646
You're going to hurt my sisters.

36:12.729 --> 36:14.845
Prue, we're your sisters.

36:15.809 --> 36:18.243
Listen to me.
You gave me the chickenpox.

36:18.409 --> 36:21.128
Yeah, and remember,
I taught you how to French kiss.

36:21.329 --> 36:23.604
You broke your ankle
when you were 7. Come on, Prue.

36:23.769 --> 36:26.966
We went to Duran Duran together.
You stretched out my legwarmers.

36:27.129 --> 36:28.448
And then you gave them to me.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.368
How do you know all this?

36:31.169 --> 36:33.000
Because we're your sisters, Prue.

36:33.609 --> 36:35.167
Sisters?

36:37.609 --> 36:38.598
Get over here.

36:48.089 --> 36:49.363
Prue.

36:50.089 --> 36:53.001
- Are you with us?
- I want Barbas.

36:53.289 --> 36:56.201
All we have to do is lay low until
midnight, and then he'll disappear

36:56.369 --> 36:58.360
and go back to wherever the hell
it is he came from.

36:58.529 --> 37:01.726
No, if he's back early,
who knows what rules apply or don't.

37:02.169 --> 37:03.602
I don't want to take any chances.

37:03.769 --> 37:05.646
Let's go show him
what his greatest fear is.

37:12.849 --> 37:14.999
If she's not back in one minute,

37:15.169 --> 37:17.967
then I'm going to spend
my last two minutes killing you.

37:18.129 --> 37:20.120
Hey, I didn't come to you.
You came to me, remember?

37:20.289 --> 37:21.563
That's right.

37:21.729 --> 37:24.482
And if you hadn't been blinded
by your passion,

37:24.649 --> 37:27.925
then I would be minutes away
from freedom right now.

37:31.449 --> 37:34.282
- Are they dead?
- They're right where they belong.

37:34.569 --> 37:36.400
- Kill them!
- No!

37:39.369 --> 37:43.248
Oh, I'm beginning to see
your attraction to the dark side.

37:43.409 --> 37:46.048
It wasn't just his dark side
I was attracted to.

37:46.209 --> 37:47.801
Do you think
you can just unfreeze him?

37:47.969 --> 37:50.563
I don't know, I've never tried.

37:53.769 --> 37:55.760
Okay.

38:01.649 --> 38:03.082
Looking for this?

38:03.249 --> 38:06.400
- What's going on?
- Witchcraft at its best.

38:17.569 --> 38:19.844
No. No!

38:24.769 --> 38:30.799
No. No! No!

38:35.769 --> 38:37.760
I never get tired of kicking his butt.

38:41.969 --> 38:44.802
Just a little something
to think about, in jail.

38:45.289 --> 38:47.644
It won't be the only thing
I think about, I promise.

38:48.489 --> 38:50.525
Is that a threat?

38:51.049 --> 38:53.404
No. It's a compliment.

39:02.729 --> 39:06.039
Dan did a really good job
with these windows.

39:06.209 --> 39:08.439
He is obviously
very good with his hands.

39:08.609 --> 39:10.679
Hey, hands off those hands.

39:10.889 --> 39:14.484
So did you decide whether or not
you're gonna move in with him?

39:15.249 --> 39:17.240
I have to admit, it's very tempting.

39:17.409 --> 39:19.479
Yeah, well, you know,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

39:19.649 --> 39:21.207
And you deserve to be happy.

39:21.649 --> 39:23.685
And don't worry about us.
We'll be fine.

39:23.889 --> 39:25.402
Especially if I get your room.

39:26.249 --> 39:29.241
Yes, you could have my room.
That is, if I was moving out.

39:29.449 --> 39:32.009
Oh, you're not gonna move out?
Oh, that's so good

39:32.169 --> 39:34.922
because you need to be with
your sisters just a little while longer.

39:36.009 --> 39:39.240
I adore Dan, but it's just way too soon
for me to move in with him.

39:39.409 --> 39:41.445
There's a few things
I need to figure out first.

39:41.609 --> 39:43.759
- Are you happy now?
- I'm delirious.

39:44.369 --> 39:45.643
Thank you.

39:45.809 --> 39:48.642
Well, just tell Marcie
that she can sell the ring

39:48.809 --> 39:50.925
and use the money
to rebuild the bookstore.

39:51.129 --> 39:53.120
Tell her it's a thank-you
for protecting us.

39:53.649 --> 39:57.278
No, Darryl, the ring is not hot.
I'll talk to you later.

39:58.329 --> 40:00.365
So, what else did Hellfire
get from Bane?

40:00.849 --> 40:05.400
Diamond necklaces, bracelets,
a Hockney, a Salvador Dalí.

40:05.609 --> 40:07.520
You can't really keep
all that stuff, can you?

40:08.769 --> 40:10.725
No.

40:10.929 --> 40:12.760
No. It wouldn't really be right.

40:12.929 --> 40:15.921
But maybe I can figure out a way to
use it for some good and save my job.

40:16.089 --> 40:19.764
And if not, I can always astral project
and job-hunt twice as fast.

40:19.929 --> 40:24.081
Sure, just rub it in. I would love
to be in two places at once.

40:24.249 --> 40:27.047
As long as one of those places is fun,
I'll be happy.

40:27.209 --> 40:29.928
I think I may have learned
a few things from Ms Hellfire.

40:30.289 --> 40:33.247
You know, change my routine,
shake things up a little bit.

40:38.049 --> 40:39.562
Jack.

40:39.889 --> 40:43.120
You know, Prue, it is bad enough
that you don't answer your phone,

40:43.289 --> 40:46.565
come into the office or otherwise
appear to be doing your job.

40:46.729 --> 40:49.038
But now you're gonna take me
down with you.

40:49.249 --> 40:50.682
What have you got
to say for yourself?

40:51.289 --> 40:53.849
Two hundred
and seventy-five thousand dollars.

40:54.089 --> 40:55.363
Excuse me?

40:55.529 --> 40:58.885
It's the market value of the anonymous
estate donation I've been out acquiring.

40:59.049 --> 41:02.041
The one request is that all proceeds
go to Stop the Violence Foundation.

41:02.209 --> 41:04.325
Not bad for a day's work, now, is it?

41:05.889 --> 41:09.086
No, it certainly isn't.

41:09.449 --> 41:12.088
You know, I never doubted you
for a moment, partner.

41:12.369 --> 41:13.768
Liar.

41:15.089 --> 41:18.320
Let's go celebrate. Partner.

41:21.049 --> 41:22.402
Okay.
