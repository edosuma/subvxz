00:07.766 --> 00:10.769
[intense dramatic music]

00:30.823 --> 00:33.585
- [Willie Lynch] If used
intensely for one year,

00:33.619 --> 00:36.174
the slaves themselves
will remain

00:36.208 --> 00:40.143
perpetually distrustful
of each other.

00:40.178 --> 00:42.111
- [Announcer] Serial number 158.

00:44.423 --> 00:48.186
- [Reporter] In 1940, the first
peacetime draft in America.

00:48.220 --> 00:49.325
- [Reporter] The
Japanese have attacked

00:49.359 --> 00:51.223
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii by air,

00:51.258 --> 00:53.191
President Roosevelt
has just announced.

01:01.475 --> 01:05.824
- [Roosevelt] Yesterday,
December 7th, 1941,

01:05.858 --> 01:08.723
a date which will
live in infamy.

01:12.348 --> 01:14.798
No matter how long
it may take us

01:14.833 --> 01:18.250
to overcome this
premeditated invasion.

01:18.285 --> 01:20.390
- [Reporter] The attack
at Pearl Harbor united,

01:20.425 --> 01:23.531
the American people as
never before in its history.

01:27.294 --> 01:29.537
- [Reporter] An era of
the greatest opportunity

01:29.572 --> 01:32.816
and prosperity in
our nation's history.

01:36.854 --> 01:40.376
[intense dramatic music]

01:45.622 --> 01:47.140
- [Roosevelt] There
have always been those

01:47.176 --> 01:49.281
who did not believe
in the people,

01:49.316 --> 01:50.662
who attempted to block

01:50.696 --> 01:52.905
their forward movement
across history.

01:55.839 --> 01:58.256
- [Harry Truman] Beyond
any shadow of a doubt,

01:58.289 --> 02:00.844
America will continue
to fight for freedom

02:00.879 --> 02:04.262
until no vestige of
resistance remains.

02:04.296 --> 02:07.644
[intense dramatic music]

02:25.662 --> 02:26.767
- Oh, look, you and daddy kinda

02:26.801 --> 02:29.252
have on the same color today.

02:29.287 --> 02:30.219
Very pretty.

02:32.635 --> 02:35.224
- Welfare Officer Richard
Huggins will see you now.

02:35.258 --> 02:37.364
- Okay, there we go--

02:37.398 --> 02:38.641
- Not you.

02:38.675 --> 02:39.745
Men have to stay here.

02:40.781 --> 02:41.816
- Excuse me, Ma'am?

02:41.851 --> 02:43.508
- Men are not allowed.

02:43.542 --> 02:45.924
- Ma'am, I know we
are not married,

02:45.958 --> 02:48.444
but we have been living
together for four years.

02:48.478 --> 02:51.447
- Well, you can speak to
Mr. Richard about that.

02:51.481 --> 02:52.827
You can come with me.

02:54.519 --> 02:56.383
- It's okay.

02:56.417 --> 02:59.248
We'll stay out here and have
fun while they go in there

02:59.281 --> 03:00.973
and take care of
all the adult stuff.

03:04.667 --> 03:07.325
[somber music]

03:37.665 --> 03:39.046
- Officer Huggins, sir.

03:39.079 --> 03:41.668
- This is Neia Clipshim,
your three o'clock.

03:41.704 --> 03:45.328
- Neia, Ma'am, why don't you
have a seat here at the desk?

03:45.363 --> 03:46.674
Would you like some water?

03:46.709 --> 03:47.848
- Yes.

03:47.882 --> 03:49.746
Yes, that would be very nice.

03:49.781 --> 03:51.921
- Pam, could you please get
Miss Neia a cup of water?

03:51.954 --> 03:54.510
Neia, have a seat and let's
talk about your situation.

03:54.543 --> 03:55.959
- Yes.

03:55.994 --> 03:57.513
- I understand you
have a daughter?

03:57.547 --> 03:58.652
- Yes, sir.

03:58.686 --> 04:00.550
- What's her name and how old?

04:00.585 --> 04:04.865
- Well, her name is Carol and
she's three years old, sir,

04:06.660 --> 04:08.489
I swear she's been here before.

04:09.421 --> 04:10.664
She's such an old soul.

04:12.079 --> 04:14.357
- What is it that you do
exactly, Miss Clipshim?

04:15.703 --> 04:16.980
- Excuse me, sir.

04:17.015 --> 04:18.879
- How do you make money?

04:18.913 --> 04:23.021
- Oh, I would love to be
a beautician, to do hair.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.781
That's actually
part of the reason

04:24.816 --> 04:27.059
that David and I moved up north.

04:27.094 --> 04:29.510
- Is David the child's father?

04:29.545 --> 04:30.649
- Yes, sir.

04:30.684 --> 04:32.479
She looks just like her daddy.

04:33.687 --> 04:35.896
- Do you love him?
- Sir?

04:42.799 --> 04:43.869
- Sorry about her.

04:45.906 --> 04:49.806
I love children,
especially little girls.

04:49.841 --> 04:51.498
And you know, to be honest,

04:51.532 --> 04:53.534
that's why I took this job

04:53.569 --> 04:58.056
because I want to help women
like you and save children.

04:58.090 --> 05:02.129
Where does David live, with you?

05:02.163 --> 05:03.751
- Yes, sir.

05:03.786 --> 05:06.547
- The law says that a
man can't live with you

05:06.582 --> 05:08.515
if you're gonna take our help.

05:09.481 --> 05:10.655
- I don't understand.

05:11.621 --> 05:13.036
Why not, sir?

05:13.071 --> 05:15.625
- If a man lives in the house,

05:15.660 --> 05:18.421
that man should be able
to provide for his family.

05:19.802 --> 05:23.668
- Well, sir, I know that
if he would, he could.

05:23.702 --> 05:26.602
It has been very hard
to find work up here.

05:26.636 --> 05:29.363
We thought it would be easier
than the south, but ...

05:29.398 --> 05:33.332
- Listen, it's not my
job to find him work.

05:34.989 --> 05:38.821
It's my job to help you raise
a healthy, happy baby girl.

05:40.719 --> 05:43.515
- Sir, what if we were married?

05:43.550 --> 05:45.483
- Then it'd be for sure no.

05:45.517 --> 05:49.452
And ma'am, would
you marry that bum?

05:49.487 --> 05:53.422
- Sir, David is no bum.

05:53.456 --> 05:56.804
- I'm not trying to tell you
what to do, but it's the law.

05:56.839 --> 05:58.944
And if you accept our services,

05:58.979 --> 06:01.982
and we come to find out that
David is still living there,

06:02.016 --> 06:04.087
then we're gonna cut
that check right off.

06:06.020 --> 06:08.057
And even worse than that,

06:08.091 --> 06:09.955
we're gonna send
both of you to jail.

06:11.509 --> 06:12.958
You said you wanted to
go to beauty school.

06:14.028 --> 06:15.823
Oh well, okay.

06:15.858 --> 06:18.654
Did you know we had a program
that would pay for that?

06:18.688 --> 06:19.862
- No. No, sir.

06:20.897 --> 06:21.933
I had no idea.

06:23.762 --> 06:27.041
- You can take care of that
girl and live your dream.

06:28.111 --> 06:29.768
That's what we could do for you.

06:31.011 --> 06:32.737
What could he do for you?

06:32.771 --> 06:35.464
I'll bet when you
go home and tell him

06:35.498 --> 06:38.743
that he has to move
out, he's gonna say

06:38.777 --> 06:41.780
"That white man's trying
to drive wedge between us."

06:43.610 --> 06:45.232
But I'll tell you right now,

06:45.266 --> 06:47.683
it has nothing to do
with blacks and whites.

06:49.098 --> 06:53.033
It's about what's the
right thing for Carol.

06:53.067 --> 06:55.656
[tense music]

06:57.727 --> 07:00.143
[pan sizzles]

07:02.939 --> 07:07.944
- Nah, nah, nah.
[little girl singing]

07:10.947 --> 07:12.535
You know, Neia,
what I'm saying is,

07:12.570 --> 07:13.985
did that white man
give you any reason

07:14.019 --> 07:15.780
as to why I can't
live in my own home?

07:17.782 --> 07:18.645
Hmm?

07:20.267 --> 07:22.442
- Carol, will you please
stop jumping on the bed?

07:24.789 --> 07:28.620
- He said if you live here,
you have to provide for us.

07:30.001 --> 07:31.485
And he said, you
are not providing

07:38.181 --> 07:40.667
Carol, Come on love.
Let's eat.

07:44.015 --> 07:45.706
- Careful, baby.
There you go.

07:45.741 --> 07:48.502
- Come on baby, sit down.

07:48.537 --> 07:49.676
Eat your food.

07:52.230 --> 07:53.127
I love you.

07:54.335 --> 07:55.889
I do.

07:55.923 --> 07:57.753
But where has that gotten us?

07:57.994 --> 07:58.581
Wha-?

07:59.237 --> 08:00.618
- Where has it gotten us?

08:01.688 --> 08:02.689
It's gotten us here.

08:05.346 --> 08:07.176
It's gotten us to the north.

08:09.937 --> 08:10.973
It's gotten us Carol.

08:12.112 --> 08:14.183
Maybe it's gotten us happiness.

08:15.149 --> 08:16.081
- David ...

08:19.084 --> 08:20.120
I'm not happy.

08:22.812 --> 08:23.675
I'm worried.

08:25.366 --> 08:26.713
I'm stressed.

08:27.783 --> 08:30.061
I'm barely feeding my child.

08:30.095 --> 08:33.202
Do you know how that makes
me feel as a mother, David?

08:35.135 --> 08:37.758
We're outta money paying
for this month's rent.

08:39.587 --> 08:44.593
- Do you hear your self?
You sound like one of them.

08:45.663 --> 08:46.664
- I sound like one of them?

08:46.698 --> 08:48.597
- You mean white, David?

08:48.631 --> 08:49.908
Is that what you're saying?

08:51.703 --> 08:53.118
Because I want better
for myself and our child,

08:53.153 --> 08:54.292
I'm sounding white?

08:56.259 --> 08:57.122
You know what?

08:58.676 --> 09:00.747
You are just as stupid
as he said you are.

09:05.614 --> 09:06.546
- I'm not leaving.

09:08.893 --> 09:10.308
I'm not.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.759
- And we'll starve
to death, David.

09:14.381 --> 09:17.557
In this winter we will
die because of your pride.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.733
- Don't you see?

09:23.079 --> 09:25.599
Don't you see what that
man is doing to us!

09:25.634 --> 09:28.809
- David, I see what
you're doing to us.

09:28.844 --> 09:29.776
I see that!

09:31.847 --> 09:35.195
[David breathes heavily]

10:10.437 --> 10:11.611
- So when do I gotta go?

10:15.476 --> 10:17.099
- As soon as I sign the papers.

10:17.133 --> 10:19.204
they could come at
any time to check.

10:19.239 --> 10:21.275
- [David] When you planning
on signing the papers?

10:23.070 --> 10:24.693
- I signed them this afternoon.

10:42.227 --> 10:46.024
- Come here, I give your
daddy a big old hug.

10:48.095 --> 10:49.821
- I love you, daddy.

10:54.032 --> 10:56.932
- I love you too, babygirl.

10:56.966 --> 10:58.071
Okay.

10:58.105 --> 11:00.763
Okay, let's go see your mom.

11:00.798 --> 11:02.075
- Come on, baby.

11:21.991 --> 11:23.786
It's all right, baby.

11:24.891 --> 11:27.031
We are gonna be all right.

11:39.353 --> 11:42.149
[upbeat music]

11:42.184 --> 11:46.844
- Look, I took this
job to help children,

11:46.878 --> 11:48.949
especially little girls.

11:49.881 --> 11:50.779
I really did.

11:52.435 --> 11:55.404
And even if he is giving
you money here and there,

11:55.438 --> 11:59.408
the moment his face gets up a
new skirt that all will stop.

11:59.442 --> 12:01.030
Trust me.

12:01.065 --> 12:02.549
And you'll be right
back here complaining

12:02.583 --> 12:04.413
about not doing
this the first time.

12:13.836 --> 12:15.010
- How much can I get?

12:18.185 --> 12:19.497
- How much do you need?

12:21.085 --> 12:23.950
I can tell you right
now, I work for you.

12:25.330 --> 12:26.435
So no matter what
he's giving you now,

12:26.469 --> 12:28.195
you know we can get more.

12:31.198 --> 12:35.064
And the moment he slips up,
we send his ass to jail.

12:39.103 --> 12:42.244
So does he have to
sign onto this also?

12:42.278 --> 12:43.141
- No.

12:44.211 --> 12:46.386
The moment you sign this,

12:46.420 --> 12:48.146
it's whatever you
want to happen.

12:49.078 --> 12:50.079
This is about you.

12:52.392 --> 12:55.050
[upbeat music]

12:58.260 --> 12:59.123
- Hi.

13:00.538 --> 13:01.401
- Oh, wow.

13:03.472 --> 13:04.818
Look at you.

13:05.854 --> 13:07.096
[Carol roars]
- Yes.

13:07.131 --> 13:08.822
Oh, I love that.

13:08.857 --> 13:11.031
All right little lady,
go wash your hands.

13:11.066 --> 13:13.413
And potty, 'cause I know you do.

13:13.447 --> 13:14.448
- Okay, mom.

13:18.556 --> 13:22.146
- I'm telling you,
she legit loves hippos

13:22.180 --> 13:24.010
the same way I did at her age.

13:24.044 --> 13:27.220
Like, I really gotta look
into getting a zoo membership.

13:28.566 --> 13:29.981
- Thanks for taking
her to the zoo.

13:31.086 --> 13:32.432
- For like the seventh time.

13:36.091 --> 13:38.645
But it's always better
when you come too though.

13:38.679 --> 13:40.267
[indistinct muttering]

13:40.302 --> 13:41.337
How was your meeting?

13:43.339 --> 13:47.481
Or I guess the better question
is, what was your meeting?

13:51.554 --> 13:56.111
- So are you still not sure
about us getting married?

13:58.147 --> 14:00.494
- Oh. [chuckles] umm...

14:04.188 --> 14:05.361
I wasn't expecting that.

14:06.017 --> 14:07.191
Uhh...

14:10.263 --> 14:11.643
You go see a pastor
or something?

14:11.678 --> 14:14.888
- I'm serious.
I need to know.

14:14.923 --> 14:17.511
- We're doing okay, we
just got back together.

14:17.546 --> 14:19.168
We're still working on
this parenting thing.

14:19.203 --> 14:21.136
- So just say you
don't wanna marry me.

14:21.170 --> 14:23.345
- No, I'm not saying never.

14:23.379 --> 14:25.002
- Well, until that happens,

14:25.036 --> 14:26.589
I need to protect
myself and Carol.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.386
- What are you talking about?

14:31.974 --> 14:33.389
- Look, I might as
well just tell you

14:33.424 --> 14:35.253
'cause you're gonna
get the letter anyway.

14:38.532 --> 14:40.293
I filed for child support today.

14:42.088 --> 14:43.468
- What the fuck?

14:43.503 --> 14:44.676
- And I don't think
it's a good idea

14:44.711 --> 14:46.264
that you stay here anymore.

14:46.299 --> 14:48.473
- Yeah, that shit is
for like dead beat dads.

14:48.508 --> 14:50.475
I have Carol every day.

14:50.510 --> 14:52.098
- Well, what am
I supposed to do?

14:52.132 --> 14:53.685
Until you put a
fucking ring on it

14:53.720 --> 14:55.411
it's the only way I
can protect myself.

14:55.446 --> 14:57.275
- Protect yourself from what?

14:57.310 --> 14:59.277
- From you, not taking care
of your responsibility.

14:59.312 --> 15:01.141
- Are you outta
your fucking mind?

15:01.176 --> 15:04.248
You refuse to pay for even
half of her school or her camp.

15:04.282 --> 15:06.146
That shit is all on me!

15:06.181 --> 15:07.976
- And what happens when
you decide to stop paying?

15:15.397 --> 15:16.260
Fuck.

15:19.228 --> 15:21.713
[somber music]

15:36.349 --> 15:37.764
- Yo, this is bullshit.

15:37.798 --> 15:39.421
So you're saying, because I said

15:39.455 --> 15:42.217
I don't think we
should get married yet,

15:42.251 --> 15:44.150
you're using this
shit against me.

15:44.184 --> 15:45.047
- You know what?

15:46.186 --> 15:47.567
I think you should leave.

15:50.052 --> 15:51.157
- Fuck you, Neia.

15:51.191 --> 15:52.020
- I'm not playing for shit--

15:52.054 --> 15:53.469
- Get off me!

15:53.504 --> 15:55.092
You know what? Then
you're going to jail.

15:55.126 --> 15:57.611
[Neia screams]

15:59.510 --> 16:00.649
- No!

16:00.683 --> 16:01.546
- Daddy!

16:21.739 --> 16:24.466
[upbeat music]

16:31.818 --> 16:33.199
- You got this.

16:34.614 --> 16:37.030
- Hey, today is
your first day too?

16:37.065 --> 16:38.618
- Yes. I'm so excited.

16:38.652 --> 16:39.619
- Where are you starting at?

16:39.653 --> 16:40.620
- Sports Line Live.

16:40.654 --> 16:41.724
- Oh my God. Me too.

16:41.759 --> 16:43.588
- What? That's crazy.

16:43.623 --> 16:45.487
I guess they're really
trying to fill the quota.

16:45.521 --> 16:47.178
- Ugh.
Where'd you go to school?

16:47.213 --> 16:48.317
- Temple.

16:48.352 --> 16:49.767
- Oh wow, girl. They are good.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.148
- Yeah, what about you?

16:51.182 --> 16:52.563
- Syracuse.

16:52.597 --> 16:53.702
What? Girl, that
was my first choice.

16:55.738 --> 17:00.295
- Hey, I know these things
can become super competitive.

17:00.329 --> 17:02.055
Let's agree to not
let that mess us up.

17:02.090 --> 17:04.367
I mean, probably only
gonna be two black women

17:04.402 --> 17:05.817
on the air anyways.

17:05.852 --> 17:08.406
- Yes. I'm totally
down with that.

17:08.441 --> 17:10.063
We gotta have each
other's backs, you know?

17:10.098 --> 17:11.064
- Okay.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.755
- All right, good.

17:12.790 --> 17:13.859
- Last thing we need is to
be looking over our shoulder.

17:13.894 --> 17:15.792
- Girl, that's right.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.069
- I'll see you up there.

17:17.105 --> 17:21.419
- Okay.
[upbeat music]

17:21.454 --> 17:22.834
- We are so excited
to have you here.

17:22.868 --> 17:24.801
- I'm really excited
to get started.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.804
- You were really highly
recommended by your professor.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.461
Says here you were at
the top of your class.

17:28.494 --> 17:30.118
- I was. I was.

17:30.152 --> 17:31.567
I know that I'm
starting fresh here

17:31.602 --> 17:33.190
and I will work very hard.

17:33.224 --> 17:34.639
- Okay, well just so you know,

17:34.674 --> 17:36.400
a lot of people
want this position

17:36.434 --> 17:37.849
and we take our
diversity very seriously.

17:37.884 --> 17:39.506
- I understand.

17:39.541 --> 17:41.232
- Well, let me just
tell you some facts.

17:41.267 --> 17:43.372
In one month, Bobby P
is gonna move networks.

17:43.407 --> 17:46.134
He's going to do some
podcast, something like that.

17:46.168 --> 17:49.206
Now that opens up a spot with
Todd on the morning broadcast.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.898
We need to answer our
calls to be more diverse.

17:51.932 --> 17:53.658
I mean, we want to.

17:53.693 --> 17:55.833
We need to make
sure we're engaging

17:55.867 --> 17:57.283
with the urban community.

17:57.317 --> 17:58.801
- I think that's very important.

17:58.836 --> 18:00.596
- I know you and
everyone at Sports Line

18:00.631 --> 18:02.322
will make the right choice.

18:02.357 --> 18:04.186
- Well, welcome to Sports Line.

18:04.221 --> 18:05.153
Let's get to work.

18:06.637 --> 18:07.776
Let's get to work.

18:07.810 --> 18:08.673
- Let's do it.

18:15.508 --> 18:16.716
- So I really
think there's a way

18:16.750 --> 18:18.925
to tie in the mother's drug use.

18:18.959 --> 18:22.722
- So you're saying on a
show that Buzzfeed says

18:22.756 --> 18:24.448
does not get the culture vibe.

18:24.482 --> 18:25.932
Let's start off the show

18:25.966 --> 18:28.555
showing a black
crack addicted mom?

18:29.556 --> 18:31.144
- No.

18:31.179 --> 18:32.594
I'm saying let's
show the struggle

18:32.628 --> 18:35.459
of what he came from
to make it to the NBA.

18:35.493 --> 18:37.702
Everyone loves a
rags to riches story.

18:37.737 --> 18:39.670
- His fucking mother died.

18:39.704 --> 18:42.500
Okay? He's in the NBA.

18:42.535 --> 18:43.950
Now what?

18:43.984 --> 18:45.883
It's not like she's on
a private jet with him.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.850
- Listen, Francine, I see
where you're trying to go.

18:47.885 --> 18:49.921
Great idea. Let's just
keep them flowing, people.

18:49.956 --> 18:51.475
Who else has got something?

18:51.509 --> 18:52.855
Come on.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.478
- I have an idea.
- Go ahead.

18:54.512 --> 18:55.893
So there's this great
program out in Oakland.

18:55.927 --> 18:57.412
Basically, they teach
these little kids

18:57.446 --> 18:58.861
how to join the union.

18:58.896 --> 19:00.518
So by the time they
graduate high school,

19:00.553 --> 19:01.830
if they don't wanna
go to college, boom.

19:01.864 --> 19:02.727
They have a job.

19:04.764 --> 19:06.490
- Okay, anyone else?

19:06.524 --> 19:07.629
Hello?

19:07.663 --> 19:09.458
Come on, ideas, people. Ideas.

19:09.493 --> 19:12.565
- What if we played up the
whole retired giving back angle?

19:12.599 --> 19:14.981
Like last year,
Marshawn Lynch retired

19:15.015 --> 19:17.363
and he started this
amazing charity

19:17.397 --> 19:20.469
where he raises money and
gives it all to teaching youth

19:20.504 --> 19:22.299
from his neighborhood
how to get jobs

19:22.333 --> 19:23.472
and how to connect to the union.

19:23.507 --> 19:25.440
- Now that is a great idea.

19:25.474 --> 19:27.752
- That's a story I can sell.

19:27.787 --> 19:29.789
- Especially the being
back at home angle.

19:29.823 --> 19:31.653
This is brilliant.

19:31.687 --> 19:34.414
- Malyka, that's exactly the
kind of idea we're looking for.

19:34.449 --> 19:35.346
- [Man] Way to go.

19:48.601 --> 19:49.981
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:50.016 --> 19:52.018
- Why weren't you at
Bobby's send away party?

19:52.052 --> 19:54.227
- I didn't know there
was a send away party.

19:54.262 --> 19:56.885
[crowd yelling]

20:04.030 --> 20:05.204
- Did you not get the email?

20:05.721 --> 20:06.584
-Ummm

20:08.414 --> 20:10.692
- No, I don't see anything.

20:10.726 --> 20:11.417
Hmmm

20:16.629 --> 20:17.630
Thanks for the cake.

20:19.045 --> 20:20.771
Can I ask you something?

20:20.805 --> 20:22.428
- What's up?

20:22.462 --> 20:23.912
- I mean, did you
see what happened

20:23.946 --> 20:24.706
back there in the
broadcast meeting?

20:25.707 --> 20:27.329
I mean, come on.

20:27.364 --> 20:29.952
Girl to girl, like you
totally stole my idea.

20:31.782 --> 20:33.715
- Joann, I have no idea
what you're trying to say.

20:33.749 --> 20:35.855
You gave a pitch,
I gave a pitch.

20:36.925 --> 20:38.651
- Is that what happened?

20:38.685 --> 20:39.652
- Of course.

20:41.378 --> 20:42.724
All on the same team, right?

20:45.313 --> 20:46.003
Hmm.

20:47.832 --> 20:50.801
God, I really have to stop
eating this, seriously.

20:50.835 --> 20:52.285
God, it is good.

20:53.907 --> 20:56.600
[ominous music]

21:06.817 --> 21:09.544
[printer beeps]

21:21.970 --> 21:23.592
- Hey, Malyka.

21:23.627 --> 21:26.526
Oh my God, you look
so pretty today.

21:26.561 --> 21:27.872
I love everything about this.

21:27.907 --> 21:29.115
Like I just, I love it.

21:29.149 --> 21:30.772
It's my favorite thing ever.

21:30.806 --> 21:32.498
- Yeah, your outfit is cute.

21:32.532 --> 21:35.328
- Thank you.
You look pretty too.

21:35.363 --> 21:37.675
- Oh my God, Joann, I
didn't even see you there.

21:42.024 --> 21:42.887
Hmm.

21:55.935 --> 22:00.008
And is it just me or does she
always seem kind of angry?

22:00.042 --> 22:02.079
- You know, I didn't notice.

22:02.113 --> 22:05.151
- That's because
you're just so nice

22:05.185 --> 22:08.430
and her hair kind of stinks

22:08.465 --> 22:10.467
and I'm not sure
what the smell is.

22:10.501 --> 22:13.435
But anyways, can I ask
you a personal question?

22:14.850 --> 22:17.405
My god, your lips.

22:17.439 --> 22:18.440
Is that a filler?

22:20.718 --> 22:22.410
I knew it. I knew it was filler.

22:23.928 --> 22:25.033
Oh my God, I love you.

22:33.213 --> 22:37.010
[clock ticking rapidly]

22:37.045 --> 22:38.943
- Hey Joann. If you're there,

22:38.978 --> 22:40.738
you can come in and please
close the door behind you.

22:43.845 --> 22:44.673
- Hi.

22:44.708 --> 22:46.192
- Hi, there.

22:46.226 --> 22:48.505
So in just a month's time,

22:48.539 --> 22:51.439
you've risen to be one of
our most talented writers.

22:51.473 --> 22:53.889
- Thank you.
- Your voice is so unique.

22:53.924 --> 22:55.788
It's so raw.

22:55.822 --> 22:57.824
I mean, the work you've did
on the Aaron Rogers piece.

22:57.859 --> 22:58.998
So articulate.

22:59.032 --> 22:59.930
- Thank you.

23:01.241 --> 23:03.451
- Malyka, you know,
it's no secret

23:03.485 --> 23:05.660
you're well liked
here in the office.

23:05.694 --> 23:07.524
I've been really impressed
with the progress you made.

23:07.558 --> 23:09.042
- Wow. Thank you.

23:10.837 --> 23:12.736
You know, there's only one
spot open on the morning show.

23:14.082 --> 23:16.015
Well, look, I'm just
gonna cut to the chase.

23:16.049 --> 23:17.810
How'd you like to
be a lead writer.

23:17.844 --> 23:20.019
- It's a great opportunity.

23:20.053 --> 23:22.711
I did hope to be
an on-air talent.

23:22.746 --> 23:24.126
- We want it to be you.

23:24.161 --> 23:25.473
- Are you serious?

23:25.507 --> 23:27.682
Yes, it's all yours.

23:27.716 --> 23:30.167
Well, let me just tell
you the whole picture.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.894
We see your voice, your words.

23:32.928 --> 23:35.690
That raw, amazing storytelling.

23:35.724 --> 23:36.829
- Yeah.

23:36.863 --> 23:38.244
- Matched with Malyka's face,

23:38.278 --> 23:41.109
I mean, that's an Emmy
waiting to happen.

23:41.143 --> 23:42.731
What do you say?

23:42.766 --> 23:43.870
You ready to have
millions of fans

23:43.905 --> 23:44.768
and represent this network?

23:44.802 --> 23:45.665
- Oh my God.

23:50.014 --> 23:50.912
Yes.

23:50.946 --> 23:52.569
Thank you.

23:52.603 --> 23:54.018
I won't let you down.

23:54.053 --> 23:55.019
- And you two are
friends, right?

23:55.054 --> 23:56.089
So everybody wins.

23:58.506 --> 23:59.196
- Thank you.

24:06.824 --> 24:08.447
- Hey, we'll see you out there.

24:11.104 --> 24:15.108
[staff applauding and cheering]

24:23.254 --> 24:27.155
- I just gotta say, thank
you for the support.

24:27.189 --> 24:31.780
You all have welcomed me
with open arms since day one.

24:31.815 --> 24:33.748
It has really been a dream.

24:33.782 --> 24:35.819
- [Woman] You're great, Malyka!

24:35.853 --> 24:38.649
[crowd cheering]

24:40.271 --> 24:43.827
- I mean, I did see the
competition for the position

24:43.861 --> 24:46.105
and I was pretty sure
I was gonna get it.

24:46.139 --> 24:48.935
[staff laughing]

24:50.350 --> 24:52.870
But you guys know
I'm just playing.

24:52.905 --> 24:54.803
I hope I make you proud.

24:54.838 --> 24:57.599
Thank you again for everything.

24:57.634 --> 24:59.532
And I will see you
all next Monday,

24:59.567 --> 25:01.051
bright and early, 4:00 AM.

25:01.085 --> 25:05.055
[staff applauding and cheering]

25:23.591 --> 25:26.559
- Why do you think you
got that spot and not me?

25:26.594 --> 25:29.320
Do you actually think you're
a better journalist than me?

25:30.874 --> 25:33.186
- Wow, that's a
strange question.

25:33.221 --> 25:37.190
But if I must
answer, I guess so.

25:39.848 --> 25:42.057
- Every story you wrote,
every single one of them,

25:42.092 --> 25:44.094
none of them were picked up.

25:44.128 --> 25:45.785
The only ideas that
were chosen in the room

25:45.820 --> 25:48.270
that you pitched were my ideas.

25:49.789 --> 25:52.171
- Sounds like you have
a bit of jealousy,

25:52.205 --> 25:53.690
which is sad because we said

25:53.724 --> 25:55.243
we would root for each other.

25:55.277 --> 25:57.003
- You don't get it, do you?

25:58.729 --> 26:00.593
They only chose you because
you're white enough.

26:00.628 --> 26:02.768
I mean black, kind of.

26:02.802 --> 26:05.115
But white enough to make
them feel comfortable.

26:06.737 --> 26:08.981
- You're saying I'm not
black enough for you?

26:09.015 --> 26:11.915
- I'm saying you're not
black enough for Wayne Brady.

26:11.949 --> 26:15.125
Matter of fact, Ted Cruz
is blacker than you.

26:17.852 --> 26:18.715
Hmm.

26:19.854 --> 26:20.717
- Joann ...

26:22.304 --> 26:24.030
I'm sorry you were passed over.

26:26.205 --> 26:28.759
Maybe if you smiled
a little bit more

26:28.794 --> 26:32.004
or were introduced
to a fucking perm,

26:32.038 --> 26:33.695
your life would've been better.

26:35.386 --> 26:38.424
But until then,

26:38.458 --> 26:42.117
I will see you Monday
bright and early 4:00 AM

26:42.152 --> 26:43.740
with my caramel macchiato

26:43.774 --> 26:46.363

27:31.926 --> 27:35.412
[Malyka snaps her fingers]

27:36.758 --> 27:38.173
- Yes?

27:38.208 --> 27:39.761
- In this sentence you wrote,

27:39.796 --> 27:40.900
"She is in Facebook
star overnight."

27:40.935 --> 27:42.868
Did you mean to say that she ...

27:42.902 --> 27:44.732
- Sorry, I was up late typing.

27:44.766 --> 27:46.319
It was a typo.

27:46.354 --> 27:48.183
- Okay, so you meant to say

27:48.218 --> 27:50.151
"She became a Facebook
star over night."

27:50.185 --> 27:51.704
- Not necessarily, she--

27:51.739 --> 27:52.429
- [Producer] Two
minutes to show time!

27:54.258 --> 27:56.191
- I knew you seeing me in
this role would be hard,

27:56.226 --> 28:00.023
but I never thought you
would try and sabotage me.

28:01.472 --> 28:03.233
Go away, I'll fix it.

28:11.034 --> 28:13.243
Watch out, you might
not be black enough.

28:13.277 --> 28:14.900
[staff laughing]

28:14.934 --> 28:16.039
She's gonna give you
the boogieman touch

28:16.073 --> 28:17.109
and make you darker.

28:17.143 --> 28:19.939
[staff laughing]

28:21.320 --> 28:22.355
- Okay, everybody.

28:22.390 --> 28:24.392
Today is a big day.

28:24.426 --> 28:27.084
It's Malyka's first
day in the big seat.

28:27.119 --> 28:30.053
[staff applauding]

28:34.436 --> 28:35.265
Okay.

[upbeat music]

28:56.838 --> 29:00.014
- Hi, I'm Malyka Bradshaw
with my colleague Todd Jensen,

29:00.048 --> 29:02.154
and we are very
excited to catch you up

29:02.188 --> 29:04.432
on all the latest
highlights from last night.

29:04.466 --> 29:07.366
- [Commentator] Oh my God!

29:07.400 --> 29:08.885
- I have to take a moment

29:08.919 --> 29:11.266
and congratulate
Malyka on her first day

29:11.301 --> 29:13.130
in the anchor here
at Sports Line.

29:13.165 --> 29:14.822
And now those Laker highlights.

29:14.856 --> 29:16.340
You know, why don't
you do the honors?

29:16.375 --> 29:18.446
- Wow, thank you, Todd.

29:18.480 --> 29:21.552
So grateful to be here and
yeah, let's jump into it.

29:21.587 --> 29:22.243
- Let's do it.

let's jump into it

29:26.419 --> 29:33.254
[tense music]

29:33.288 --> 29:35.152
- No shocker here.

29:35.187 --> 29:38.777
The Lakers lose again, this
time to the Sun's, 100 to 92.

29:40.433 --> 29:43.954
- I tell you, I could feel the
heat coming from that gate.

29:43.989 --> 29:44.990
- Holy shit!

29:45.024 --> 29:47.958

30:36.420 --> 30:39.078
[upbeat music]

30:59.098 --> 31:00.513
- [Nate] What's up?

31:00.548 --> 31:02.067
- [Aunty Terry] What's up?

31:02.101 --> 31:03.206
- [Nate] How y'all
doing? How y'all doing?

31:03.240 --> 31:04.207
- [Aunty Terry] How you doing?

31:04.241 --> 31:05.691
- [Nate] How you doing?

31:05.725 --> 31:06.312
- I don't even know
how long, what's up?

31:08.418 --> 31:10.489
- What's up? What's up?

31:10.523 --> 31:11.386
Hey.

31:14.527 --> 31:16.288
That should cover for
what you got today.

31:16.322 --> 31:17.185
You feel that?

31:19.187 --> 31:20.050
You know I got your back, Aunty.

31:21.396 --> 31:23.295
- All this land this
woman got around

31:23.329 --> 31:25.124
and all these kids wanna do
is run around in the house.

31:25.159 --> 31:27.230
I tell you, my hip been
bothering me something crazy.

31:27.264 --> 31:28.403
- Man, what up Doh?

31:30.405 --> 31:32.062
I know you hear me, what up Doh?

31:32.097 --> 31:32.994
- What up, Doh?

31:33.029 --> 31:33.995
- [Rob] Yeah.

31:34.030 --> 31:35.479
- Boy, what's my name?

31:35.514 --> 31:36.377
- Uncle Nate.

31:38.241 --> 31:39.518
- How you feeling young fella?

31:39.552 --> 31:40.657
Looking good.

31:40.691 --> 31:42.486
- You know what it is, we cool.

31:42.521 --> 31:44.005
Maintaining, you know?

31:44.040 --> 31:45.696
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

31:45.731 --> 31:47.319
Man, what you drinking, man?

31:47.353 --> 31:48.665
You got a box of
the Corona virus?

31:48.699 --> 31:50.287
- [Nate] I bought this case.

31:50.322 --> 31:52.358
- Yeah, I know you
did. It figures.

31:52.393 --> 31:53.497
- Boy, what you bring?

31:53.532 --> 31:55.085
- Oh, you mean besides the food

31:55.120 --> 31:57.950
you fitting to make
three plates on?

31:57.985 --> 32:00.056
Ay yo, go to the car,
get that bottle of Henny.

32:00.090 --> 32:01.195
- Got you.

32:01.229 --> 32:02.955
- Yeah, you like that?

32:04.336 --> 32:06.200
- You really think you
the shit, don't you?

32:06.234 --> 32:07.097
- Don't you?

32:08.064 --> 32:09.341
Don't be jealous.

32:10.376 --> 32:11.481
- [Nate] Jealous?

32:11.515 --> 32:13.172
- Yeah, you had your time.

32:13.207 --> 32:14.553
- Had my time?

32:14.587 --> 32:16.693
Boy, I'm still on time.
I'm still on top.

32:16.727 --> 32:18.626
You look 30 years older than me

32:18.660 --> 32:20.007
running around with the top of
your head looking like a mop.

32:20.041 --> 32:21.042
[Rob laughs]

32:21.077 --> 32:23.079
Hey, hey and listen,

32:23.113 --> 32:25.184
I don't even know why
I'm talking to you
about being on time

32:25.219 --> 32:27.221
or having anything like
that or having a time.

32:27.255 --> 32:29.085
You don't know nothing
about Uncle Nate.

32:29.119 --> 32:30.534
You don't know how I
used to put it on 'em.

32:30.569 --> 32:32.364
Used to take 'em down
to the [indistinct]

32:32.398 --> 32:34.642
Y'all know nothing about
getting to know a girl.

32:34.676 --> 32:37.369
First and last
name, her mama name.

32:37.403 --> 32:39.129
What her sign is.

32:40.786 --> 32:42.650
What I'm trying to tell
you is I come from the era

32:42.684 --> 32:44.272
where we used to take a
woman out, hold her hand.

32:44.307 --> 32:46.550
Take her for a slow
walk, get to know her,

32:46.585 --> 32:49.001
get to know her mama and
her daddy, her brothers,

32:49.036 --> 32:50.727
in case they wanted
to beat you up.

32:50.761 --> 32:52.694
I come from the era where
you actually had to earn it.

32:52.729 --> 32:54.593
Let's be real, son.

32:54.627 --> 32:56.284
Y'all don't get no pussy
unless it come with a app.

32:56.319 --> 32:58.045
- [Aunt Terry] Hey,
watch your mouth!

32:58.079 --> 33:00.288
- I'm sorry, sis.
You know how it is.

33:00.323 --> 33:02.221
I just had to let
him know one time.

33:02.256 --> 33:04.741
- Y'all are always arguing.
That's enough now.

33:04.775 --> 33:06.639
Now Rob, did you get a plate
for you and your friends?

33:06.674 --> 33:08.227
- You always talking that
we don't know shit this,

33:08.262 --> 33:09.677
we don't know shit that.

33:09.711 --> 33:11.161
Aunty, I'm gonna eat later.

33:12.645 --> 33:13.474
What did you do all your life?

33:13.508 --> 33:14.475
- What I do?

33:14.509 --> 33:15.476
Boy, I was a plumber.

33:15.510 --> 33:17.064
20 years, union job.

33:17.098 --> 33:18.341
- So why you ain't
teach me that?

33:18.375 --> 33:19.480
- Teach you what?

33:19.514 --> 33:20.688
- Why you ain't teach me that?

33:20.722 --> 33:21.827
You knew when my
pa got locked up

33:21.861 --> 33:23.139
you could have said something.

33:23.173 --> 33:24.140
You could have done something.

33:24.174 --> 33:25.555
You could have talked--

33:25.589 --> 33:26.176
- Don't talk about
my brother like that.

33:28.868 --> 33:30.215
- Stop, stop.

33:30.249 --> 33:31.354
- No, no.
Let him go.

33:32.734 --> 33:33.701
What you want? What
you, embarrassed?

33:33.735 --> 33:35.530
You gonna fuck who up?

33:35.565 --> 33:37.325
Yeah, I ain't one of
your little friends,

33:37.360 --> 33:39.465
that you can give
$20 to and impress.

33:39.500 --> 33:40.708
I'm a real man.

33:40.742 --> 33:42.606
You don't know shit about that.

33:42.641 --> 33:44.505
Matter of fact, none of
the niggas you roll with,

33:44.539 --> 33:46.093
know shit about that.

33:46.127 --> 33:48.095
I'm on top because
I do for mine.

33:48.129 --> 33:50.097
You on top because
they scared of you

33:50.131 --> 33:52.478
or they want some money from
you or something like that.

33:52.513 --> 33:55.309
Tell you what, next time you
wanna do some real man shit,

33:55.343 --> 33:56.551
come holler at your Uncle Nate.

33:56.586 --> 33:58.139
I can show you how we get down.

33:58.174 --> 33:59.623
- You gonna show
me how to get down?

33:59.658 --> 34:02.109
I'm gonna show that's
how I get down, nigga.

34:02.143 --> 34:04.525
- [Aunty Terry] Was
all that necessary?

34:04.559 --> 34:06.078
Come on.

34:06.113 --> 34:07.769
- I'm tired of him
acting like he's tough.

34:07.804 --> 34:10.219
That's your nephew who I
haven't seen in over a year.

34:10.255 --> 34:13.120
[family yelling]

34:13.154 --> 34:15.708
[intense music]

34:17.193 --> 34:19.126
- If used intensely
for one year,

34:20.368 --> 34:22.612
the slaves themselves
will remain

34:22.646 --> 34:26.478
perpetually distrustful
of each other.

34:26.512 --> 34:27.650
- What the fuck is happening?

34:27.686 --> 34:30.101
- Here, you dropped this.

34:32.656 --> 34:34.244
Take it, man.

34:34.279 --> 34:37.315
- You must use the
dark skin slaves

34:37.351 --> 34:39.835
versus the light skin slaves.

34:41.148 --> 34:42.217
- Why am I here?

34:42.252 --> 34:43.873
- Listen, all right?

34:43.909 --> 34:45.428
- [Willie Lynch] That distrust
is stronger than trust.

34:45.462 --> 34:46.808
- My favorite part coming up.

34:46.842 --> 34:51.158
- And envy is stronger
than admiration.

34:51.192 --> 34:54.333
Don't forget, you must use

34:54.368 --> 34:58.475
the old nigger versus
the young nigger.

34:58.510 --> 35:03.273
This will break the opportunity
of generation teaching.

35:03.308 --> 35:06.518
There will be no
line to learn from.

35:06.552 --> 35:11.557
This will create a true fall
of anger, jealousy and hate.

35:13.628 --> 35:16.873
You will have no
protection with each other.

35:16.907 --> 35:21.464
Pay little attention
to original breaking

35:21.498 --> 35:24.329
and concentrate on
future breaking.

35:24.363 --> 35:27.918
You must keep the body
and take the mind.

35:29.472 --> 35:32.406
In other words, break
the will to resist.

35:34.201 --> 35:38.550
Break the female horse until
she is tender and kind.

35:40.310 --> 35:42.450
And when it comes to breaking
the uncivilized nigger,

35:43.382 --> 35:46.178
I use the same process

35:46.213 --> 35:47.766
but step up the pressure.

35:49.250 --> 35:52.426
You must use the
female versus the male

35:52.460 --> 35:54.911
and the male versus the female.

35:54.945 --> 35:59.812
You must castrate the male
in full view of the female.

36:01.020 --> 36:03.368
If the woman raises the male

36:03.402 --> 36:06.474
to be strong in body
and weak in mind,

36:06.509 --> 36:11.514
it will be easier to control
for future generations.

36:12.584 --> 36:14.448
- [A.O] Pull yourself together.

36:14.482 --> 36:15.863
- [Willie Lynch] This will
only happen if you separate

36:15.897 --> 36:18.866
the male nigger
from his family ...

36:20.419 --> 36:21.834
- What is happening to me?
What is happening to me?

36:21.869 --> 36:22.870
What is happening to me?

36:22.904 --> 36:24.285
What happening to me?

36:24.320 --> 36:25.286
What is happening to me?

36:25.321 --> 36:26.287
What's happening to me?

36:26.322 --> 36:27.288
What is happening to me?

36:27.323 --> 36:28.876
What is happening to me?

36:28.910 --> 36:29.739
Who are you?

36:29.773 --> 36:30.809
Who are you?

36:30.843 --> 36:31.844
Who are you?

36:35.434 --> 36:36.918
- I'm A.O.

36:36.953 --> 36:38.644
That's what they call me.

36:38.679 --> 36:39.542
- You trying to make me a slave.

36:42.061 --> 36:43.925
- You are a slave.

36:45.755 --> 36:48.482
I pulled you aside for one
reason only my brother.

36:50.346 --> 36:54.902
I need you to understand that
your melanin is a godly gift.

36:57.905 --> 37:00.735
It can never be
taken away from you,

37:02.530 --> 37:06.396
but they will constantly keep
you from playing the game

37:08.743 --> 37:12.368
because they know
that banded together,

37:14.059 --> 37:17.027
if they give you a chance to
play, you'll win every time.

37:19.927 --> 37:23.482
They will always
change the rules

37:24.587 --> 37:27.590
because you are not unified.

37:29.005 --> 37:30.938
Do you understand?

37:34.010 --> 37:34.873
- Yes, sir.

37:37.047 --> 37:37.910
What can I do?

37:41.604 --> 37:42.639
- I'm gonna teach you

37:44.572 --> 37:47.023
how to systematically reverse

37:47.057 --> 37:48.818
the teachings of Willie Lynch.

37:50.406 --> 37:51.924
Let's get started, my brother.

37:51.959 --> 37:54.617
[finger snaps]

37:56.066 --> 37:58.793
[ominous music]
