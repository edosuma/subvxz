WEBVTT

00:24.691 --> 00:26.735
You do know this isn't a church, right?

00:28.654 --> 00:30.364
Vodka and ginger ale, please.

00:31.615 --> 00:32.616
Coming right up.

00:37.246 --> 00:38.247
Here you go.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.755
- There you go.
- Thank you.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.469
You're reading <i>Breaking Dawn</i>?

00:52.469 --> 00:53.971
Somebody left it here.

00:53.971 --> 00:56.640
You know, it's pretty confusing, actually.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.559
A bunch of characters
just come out of nowhere.

00:59.685 --> 01:02.145
You know there are several books
before that one, right?

01:03.146 --> 01:04.605
I do. Yes.

01:05.274 --> 01:08.026
Well, if you like books...

01:08.026 --> 01:10.696
Yes. The original fantasy book.

01:10.696 --> 01:13.073
And also involves characters
coming out of nowhere.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.025
Hey.

01:48.692 --> 01:52.696
Look at you.
Next great ceramicist in the making.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.156
Yeah, I don't think so.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.535
What ever happened to doing something
just because you like to?

01:58.535 --> 01:59.661
Right.

02:01.205 --> 02:05.918
I think it's important to know
what brings you satisfaction.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.170
Even in the difficult times.

02:09.963 --> 02:15.636
"Our hearts ache, but we always have joy."
That's 2 Corinthians 6--

02:15.636 --> 02:16.720
Yeah, the Bible.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.181
You know what I love about the Bible?

02:19.181 --> 02:21.391
I love how there's, like,
nothing wrong with it,

02:21.391 --> 02:24.186
especially the part about the wives
who aren't virgins getting stoned.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.313
It's, like, chef's kiss.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.732
Look, I'm not trying
to check up on you. I--

02:30.025 --> 02:31.902
Your dad said
you'd been having a tough time

02:31.902 --> 02:33.904
this summer since the loss of Kolton.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.907
- He told you that?
- I know you've been dealing with a lot.

02:37.574 --> 02:41.537
And I know you also might feel
like an outsider, coming back to school.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.414
I can think of someone else
who felt like an outsider.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.083
If you say "Jesus," I swear to God...

02:48.460 --> 02:49.962
I was talking about myself.

02:51.713 --> 02:55.425
You know, when I moved to Deerfield
I felt very out of place.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.804
So why did you stay here?

02:59.471 --> 03:01.306
And why did you come here
in the first place?

03:01.306 --> 03:05.394
And, if you don't mind me asking,
why did you become a priest?

03:07.563 --> 03:11.733
This is about you, Trina.
My life isn't really important here.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.818
Really?

03:12.818 --> 03:14.528
'Cause you're basically
like the poster boy

03:14.528 --> 03:16.321
for the machine right now.

03:17.948 --> 03:21.368
I mean, you must be pretty stoked.
All publicity is good publicity, right?

03:23.453 --> 03:25.038
Although maybe not for priests.

03:36.675 --> 03:37.968
All right.

03:43.640 --> 03:47.019
That's not bad. That's not bad at all.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.731
What's all the fuss about?

03:51.982 --> 03:53.108
That--

03:56.737 --> 03:58.697
Oh, shoot, that's hot!

04:01.450 --> 04:02.910
Oh, right in the nozzies.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.290
What do they put in that? Okay.

04:08.290 --> 04:12.127
Oh, my God, this is silly. This is--
This isn't right.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.547
Oi yoi yoi.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.304
What am I looking at here?

04:22.304 --> 04:24.556
Nothing, I was just chomping
on some hot wings.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.600
Which I didn't mind, actually.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.687
- Did you get a tattoo?
- Well, it was-- Yeah.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.773
Surprise! It's for your mom.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.985
- Why does it say, "I love Poo"?
- It doesn't say, "I love Poo."

04:36.985 --> 04:40.030
- It says, "I love Poo."
- No, it's going to say, "I love Puff."

04:40.030 --> 04:43.158
Which is what I used to call your mom.
Except, it turns out that the human ribs

04:43.158 --> 04:47.120
are an extraordinarily painful place
to get a tattoo. So, I had to tap out.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.039
You could always change it to,
"I love pussy."

04:49.039 --> 04:50.165
Trina.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.125
- Unless you don't.
- Trina, don't do that.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.461
Hey.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.756
What's going on? Why are you shirtless?

04:58.507 --> 05:00.968
I was just eating wings
and things got out of hand.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.761
Dad got half a tattoo for you.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.222
Gonna give you guys room
so you can bone it out.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.144
Can I see?

05:11.144 --> 05:15.315
It was meant to be a surprise, but okay.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.068
- You ready?
- Okay.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.488
"I love..."

05:21.488 --> 05:22.573
Puff!

05:22.573 --> 05:24.408
It's gonna say, "I love Puff."

05:24.408 --> 05:27.911
I have to go back for another session
because they ran out of ink.

05:27.911 --> 05:31.707
Did I say something that made you think
that I wanted this?

05:31.707 --> 05:33.917
No-- I mean, not explicitly.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.296
I just--
I wanted to do something romantic,

05:37.296 --> 05:39.673
and something unexpected
and something that showed you

05:39.673 --> 05:42.259
- that I loved you.
- I love you, too.

05:42.926 --> 05:46.513
- And this really is a surprising gesture.
- Right.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.224
And so permanent.

05:49.224 --> 05:50.559
That's why, I don't know,

05:50.559 --> 05:54.771
I feel like maybe this should be,
like, the last puffin-related thing

05:54.771 --> 05:56.023
that you do for me.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.859
What do you mean?

05:59.526 --> 06:02.237
Well, you know,
just in terms of, like, puffin gifts.

06:02.237 --> 06:05.282
And the nickname, "Puff,"
which I thought we had retired.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.909
But,

06:06.909 --> 06:10.370
it's mainly because I only really said
that I thought they were cute one time.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.080
Oh, my God.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.667
Okay. No.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.544
I mean, that's fine.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.214
- I'm glad you told me now.
- Yeah?

06:20.214 --> 06:22.216
Yeah, 'cause now all we need to do is--

06:22.216 --> 06:27.971
is to dispose of 20 years
of utterly pointless romantic gestures,

06:27.971 --> 06:29.348
starting with this little fella.

06:29.348 --> 06:30.891
- Okay.
- In we go.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.726
Maybe you don't have
to get rid of everything.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.312
No. You're absolutely right, baby. I mean...

06:36.021 --> 06:38.065
It's pathetic
holding on to stuff like this

06:38.065 --> 06:40.025
just because we had it on our first date.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.735
- Yeah, the whole puffin thing is dead.
- Dusty.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.196
Definitely need to lose some
of these stuffed bastards.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.782
- You don't have to--
- Puffin calendar, trash.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.868
Puffin notebook I got you
for your anniversary, trash.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.329
I am getting hot sauce
on everything, by the way.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.539
- Dusty.
- Puffin crackers.

06:53.539 --> 06:54.831
Sure you wanna be done with these?

06:54.831 --> 06:57.417
- I don't really eat those.
- Great. Done. Anything else?

06:57.417 --> 06:58.919
There's more over here.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.089
Yes, there are more things.
And they're everywhere.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.217
But, sweetie, you don't have
to throw them away.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.010
Baby, I'm not trying to upset you.

07:07.010 --> 07:10.931
Oh, yeah, fuck! No. My side. It's--
The ink is still fresh.

07:10.931 --> 07:14.142
I don't know what's going on with you.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.644
Nothing is going on with me.

07:17.563 --> 07:21.191
You said that thing about how we should
still be able to surprise each other.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.444
Feels like
you're the only one doing surprises.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.030
I mean,
firstly you get the "royalty" card,

07:27.030 --> 07:28.407
and you keep it to yourself.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.659
- Oh, Dusty.
- And then there's the hot wings bombshell.

07:30.659 --> 07:33.996
And then you're suddenly cheerleading
at the basketball.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.874
And you get a new haircut,
which is gorgeous, by the way.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.292
Thank you.

07:38.292 --> 07:41.962
People, because of this machine,
are quitting their jobs.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.046
They're moving away.

07:43.046 --> 07:45.174
They're ending
their long-term relationships

07:45.174 --> 07:47.885
and diving into new ones willy-nilly.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.304
- You heard.
- Heard what?

07:50.304 --> 07:51.638
We are gathered here

07:51.638 --> 07:54.641
at Giorgio's Italian Restaurant
and Sports Center

07:54.641 --> 07:58.395
to celebrate the union
of Principal Patricia Burgess

07:58.395 --> 08:00.439
and Mr. Farid Malik,

08:00.439 --> 08:04.526
whose love has been blessed
by the grace of God.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.989
And the MORPHO machine.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.328
Oh, Farid. My love.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.246
When I first got my "biker" potential,

08:16.246 --> 08:18.957
I thought it was the greatest thing
that could have ever happened.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.668
Then, when I got into my accident,
I thought it was the worst thing

08:21.668 --> 08:23.462
that could have ever happened.

08:23.462 --> 08:27.341
But if I hadn't have smacked my head
and gone to the hospital,

08:27.341 --> 08:29.301
then I would have never met you.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.386
Haven't they known each other for years?

08:31.386 --> 08:35.724
What if you hadn't have gotten "lover"
as your life potential?

08:35.724 --> 08:38.101
Maybe you wouldn't have stayed up
with me all night.

08:38.101 --> 08:41.772
Holding my hand.
Making sure I didn't fall asleep.

08:43.065 --> 08:45.234
- We talked about everything.
- Yeah!

08:45.234 --> 08:49.530
And I knew, then and there,
that my true life potential was with you.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.407
Are you sure you're not concussed?

08:54.785 --> 08:58.205
As these two lovebirds
have so beautifully demonstrated,

08:58.747 --> 09:03.460
the MORPHO machine, like the Lord,
works in mysterious ways.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.548
And one wonders if it's all part
of some grander plan

09:07.548 --> 09:11.468
or just completely random.

09:17.432 --> 09:22.521
Like the morpho butterfly,
Pat and Farid's love has taken flight,

09:22.521 --> 09:23.814
and we can only hope

09:23.814 --> 09:27.025
that they are potentially
together forever.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.027
Yeah. Hear.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.618
Would you all like to exchange rings?

09:37.578 --> 09:39.872
We're actually going to exchange wings.

09:41.290 --> 09:42.708
Here we go.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.295
Wonderful.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.381
- Hey, Father.
- Hey, Father.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.592
- Excuse me, Father.
- You just said the machine is God,

09:51.592 --> 09:53.302
and I know you're close to God, so...

09:53.302 --> 09:55.512
I really don't have anything to do
with the machine.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.682
Father, I'd love to pick your brain,
very quickly--

09:58.682 --> 09:59.975
about the mysteries of the universe.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.102
I got "florist."

10:02.102 --> 10:04.855
Now, I'm thinking florist,
flowers, petals.

10:04.855 --> 10:08.609
Bikes have pedals. I'm a biker.
So, I'm doing the right thing, right?

10:08.609 --> 10:10.444
- Yeah. Sorry, but--
- Excuse me, Father.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.737
Father.

10:11.737 --> 10:12.905
All right, people.

10:12.905 --> 10:15.782
How about we let Father Reuben
enjoy the party, huh?

10:15.782 --> 10:17.326
Drinks.

10:17.326 --> 10:19.328
- I'll take one.
- Okay.

10:20.913 --> 10:22.664
Didn't know I would see you here.

10:22.664 --> 10:26.877
Yeah. When Mr. Malik asked me to come,
I thought he meant as a guest, but...

10:27.711 --> 10:29.671
So, you're enjoying this
about as much as I am?

10:29.671 --> 10:31.215
Oh, yeah.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.634
Just waiting for my turn on the gondola.

10:35.761 --> 10:39.848
So, they got together a week ago,
and now they're married? That's fun.

10:39.848 --> 10:44.186
Yeah. Well, I don't know.
They seem very in love.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.647
See how they're looking at each other.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.607
She literally can't move her neck,
can she?

10:48.607 --> 10:50.234
'Cause of the brace.

10:50.234 --> 10:53.779
Come on. What, you don't think
they're rushing into things a bit?

10:54.363 --> 10:56.573
People could say the same about us.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.450
What? We didn't rush into things.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.827
I mean, Dusty, we were 20.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.706
We didn't know anything
about ourselves or relationships.

11:04.706 --> 11:07.376
Yeah, but I didn't need a machine
to tell me I was supposed to be with you.

11:07.376 --> 11:10.254
- It's not a competition.
- I mean, look at us now.

11:10.254 --> 11:13.465
Twenty years later,
still surprising each other.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.969
You know what would be surprising,
is if you were a little more open.

11:16.969 --> 11:19.721
You know, a little more openhearted,
a little more optimistic.

11:20.305 --> 11:24.017
- Hey. How much fun is this, right?
- So much.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.102
Man.

11:25.644 --> 11:29.189
Cass, you are looking
exceptionally stunning this evening.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.148
Thanks.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.694
Dusty, you are here too.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.322
- Just kidding with you, bud.
- Oh, yep.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.742
How about that ceremony, right?
It was so moving.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.786
I was fighting back tears the whole time.

11:42.786 --> 11:45.330
And that was a fight
that I was losing, man.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.915
Actually, I was too.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.792
Stop that. Look at us.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.879
Look at us. Just a couple of
bighearted softies over here.

11:51.879 --> 11:55.090
Not like big Dust-bust,
keeping all those emotions under--

11:55.090 --> 11:57.176
- under lock and key.
- No.

11:57.176 --> 11:59.511
I can optimistically say

11:59.511 --> 12:04.391
it was the most heartwarming
machine-inspired union

12:04.391 --> 12:07.769
between two people who have been together
less than eight days I have ever seen.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.314
Have you guys tried the appies?
You gotta try the appies.

12:10.314 --> 12:12.900
Check out the--
the latest on Giorgio's menu.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.153
Cass wings, aka hot wings.

12:17.321 --> 12:18.322
That's not even subtle.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.873
- I think you should--
- Look who's here.

12:27.873 --> 12:28.957
Hello, Martha.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.460
You have to introduce me
to your new partner.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.588
She's my wife. But, yes, you know Rose.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.634
She's been on the Deerfest committee
for the past five years.

12:38.634 --> 12:41.720
I'm sorry.
It's this harsh arcade lighting.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.805
It just makes everyone look so much older.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.227
So, Izzy, are you here as a friend
of the bride or the groom?

12:48.227 --> 12:50.062
I'm here as mayor.

12:50.062 --> 12:52.564
I'm obliged to attend
every event in this town.

12:52.564 --> 12:53.815
So, you weren't invited.

12:53.815 --> 12:57.986
But speaking of political duties,
we were just talking about the inn

12:57.986 --> 13:02.449
and wondered if you've had time
to sign that permit we requested?

13:02.449 --> 13:05.369
Martha, if you wanna talk to me,
just talk to me.

13:05.369 --> 13:07.329
You don't have to make this about permits.

13:07.329 --> 13:09.373
No, but I really do just need the permit.

13:09.373 --> 13:10.541
It's been decades,

13:10.541 --> 13:13.877
and you still think you have
to build a moat just to talk to me.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.713
- A moat.
- Just give us the fucking permit.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.715
- Okay. Just--
- And watch your damn hands.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.759
Come on, Rose. This is pointless.

13:20.759 --> 13:21.844
Wow.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.221
She got to touch you? This is ridiculous.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.239
Excuse me. Hello.

13:42.239 --> 13:44.199
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

13:46.660 --> 13:49.621
Well, it's my turn
to give my gift to the bride and groom.

13:50.622 --> 13:53.876
But I'll need a little space,
if you all could just move aside, please.

13:54.793 --> 13:55.794
Please.

13:57.129 --> 14:00.382
Now, as you all know, in addition
to being your mayor...

14:02.509 --> 14:03.760
I'm also a dancer.

14:04.428 --> 14:06.722
- She wouldn't.
- You know that she would.

14:06.722 --> 14:07.931
And Pat and Farid,

14:09.349 --> 14:12.352
I can't think of a better way
to celebrate your new relationship

14:12.352 --> 14:17.649
- than with the gift... of movement.
- Of movement.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.443
Hit it, Jacob.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.411
I know you're not enjoying this,

14:29.411 --> 14:31.663
but we're gonna be talking
about it for years,

14:31.663 --> 14:34.333
so try to watch as much as you can.

15:25.259 --> 15:26.969
I need another drink immediately.

15:28.262 --> 15:29.805
- On it. Yes.
- Immediately.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.015
My mother's vagina is on display.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.475
I know.

15:36.061 --> 15:39.606
Glass of white wine, please, bartendress. Father.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.568
- Hey.
- "Father is Father."

15:44.695 --> 15:46.196
There you go.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.031
Interesting glass choice.

15:48.031 --> 15:51.535
I brought 'em over from the bar.
Thought they were wedding-appropriate.

15:51.535 --> 15:54.830
- Got 'em on clearance at Dear Izzy's.
- Wait, Farid has you buying supplies now?

15:54.830 --> 15:57.624
Yeah, he's been asking me to do a lot more
since he got his potential.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.210
- I can't say I love it.
- And what about your potential, Hana?

16:00.210 --> 16:03.088
I actually haven't used that thing,
and I don't plan to.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.716
What about that voice
telling you to be like everyone else?

16:05.716 --> 16:08.510
- I don't have one of those.
- Cool.

16:08.510 --> 16:09.928
Me neither.

16:13.307 --> 16:16.226
You guys are newish to town,
so you probably find it strange

16:16.226 --> 16:18.312
that a woman who wasn't actually invited
to the wedding

16:18.312 --> 16:20.814
is currently stealing focus
from the bride and groom

16:20.814 --> 16:24.359
by doing an improvised,
overtly sexual, dance solo.

16:24.359 --> 16:27.362
But I'd like to reassure you, that
it's much more fucked up than it seems.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.947
I wanna know everything.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.825
Do you see how most
of the high kicks are being directed

16:31.825 --> 16:34.870
at that woman who's pretending
to stare at the olive cart?

16:34.870 --> 16:38.207
That's Martha. Martha is Izzy's ex.

16:38.207 --> 16:41.877
Martha and Izzy moved to Deerfield
when Cass was nine, and ever since,

16:41.877 --> 16:45.297
Izzy has talked about the dance career
she left behind in the city.

16:45.297 --> 16:48.050
Wow. Okay. She's got some moves.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.801
Yeah, but it was the '90s.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.929
Who wasn't a professional dancer
in the '90s, right?

16:51.929 --> 16:53.639
Were you a professional dancer
in the '90s?

16:54.806 --> 16:56.016
Have you heard of <i>Riverdance</i>?

16:56.016 --> 16:57.351
- You were in <i>Riverdance</i>?
- No,

16:57.351 --> 17:00.187
I was a founding member of River-Prance,

17:00.187 --> 17:03.148
an all-boys, mixed ability,
multi-genre dance troupe.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.273
- Oh, dear God.
- In many ways,

17:04.273 --> 17:07.611
we considered ourselves a creative riposte
to Irish dance culture,

17:07.611 --> 17:10.446
which was quite stifling.
All laces and braces.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.699
But we were young. It was subversive shit.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.992
Very punk.

17:13.992 --> 17:18.497
In a way, yeah. We dabbled in many genres.

17:18.497 --> 17:19.705
Incorporated all the greats.

17:20.415 --> 17:24.169
Chaka Khan, Bananarama,
George Michael, Run-DMC.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.046
Well, now we know
why Cass fell in love with you.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.923
No, this was pre-Cass.

17:27.923 --> 17:29.174
I don't think she's--

17:30.259 --> 17:33.387
Cass is doing something adorable.
This isn't going to end well.

17:33.387 --> 17:36.181
Oh, yes,
she's dancing with the flower girl,

17:36.181 --> 17:38.308
and it's very, fucking charming.

17:38.308 --> 17:41.353
And now other people are starting
to find it charming.

17:41.353 --> 17:44.231
And, that means that
Izzy's not gonna get all of the attention.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.858
And she sees it.

17:45.858 --> 17:47.901
Now she's looking over
to see if Martha sees it.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.070
Martha sees it too. That's the ball game!

17:52.239 --> 17:53.240
Good luck.

17:54.283 --> 17:57.828
Well, you sure know how to steal
someone's thunder, don't you?

17:57.828 --> 17:59.204
Pardon me?

17:59.204 --> 18:00.831
You couldn't give me five minutes?

18:00.831 --> 18:02.749
I'm stealing thunder?

18:02.749 --> 18:05.002
It's bad enough she's here
with that woman.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.337
I can't even believe
they're still together.

18:07.337 --> 18:10.090
Then again, Rose doesn't have kids.

18:11.133 --> 18:14.845
And Martha always said
that I had too much baggage.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.102
What's up, whorebag?

18:23.437 --> 18:25.189
Because of the glass.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.442
Sorry, that didn't feel good coming
out of my mouth.

18:28.442 --> 18:29.651
What did she just say to you?

18:31.236 --> 18:33.405
Nothing I haven't heard before, so...

18:36.366 --> 18:37.910
Anything I can do to cheer you up?

18:38.952 --> 18:42.873
No. We can actually go if that's okay.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.585
I'm gonna go say bye to Pat.

18:53.091 --> 18:54.301
Maybe I could talk to Giorgio

18:54.301 --> 18:56.345
- about making you the in-house deejay.
- Yeah.

18:56.345 --> 18:59.640
It'd be fun to talk to you without
having to stuff my face with fish cakes.

18:59.640 --> 19:03.060
These are actually fish in a towel.
Giorgio's take on pigs in a blanket.

19:08.524 --> 19:09.858
I do mean it, though.

19:10.442 --> 19:12.486
It's really hard being out with you
in public and, like,

19:12.486 --> 19:14.988
constantly having to worry
that people might find out.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.700
- Well, what's the alternative?
- I just thought, eventually,

19:18.700 --> 19:20.619
- we could--
- What up, doggie bags?

19:21.328 --> 19:23.163
Hi, Dad. I'm just circulating.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.958
And you're killing it.
Is that fish in a towel?

19:28.961 --> 19:30.128
Why is everything spicy?

19:30.128 --> 19:31.839
There's zero spice in that.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.260
- What up, deejay table?
- Hey.

19:36.802 --> 19:37.803
Are you doing requests?

19:39.054 --> 19:42.099
It's literally just my phone plugged
into a speaker, so, yeah.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.392
Cool.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.857
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.028
Hello, everyone.

19:56.071 --> 19:58.490
Hello, I'm Dusty.

19:58.490 --> 20:02.995
I also have a surprise gift that I'd like
to share with the happy couple.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.414
Hope it's a good surprise.

20:06.498 --> 20:08.500
Principal Pat and Farid,

20:09.168 --> 20:11.962
I know that some might think
that this is all a bit quick,

20:11.962 --> 20:14.214
and you have no way of knowing
if you're right for each other,

20:14.214 --> 20:17.509
but I, for one, have faith.

21:42.302 --> 21:43.971
I gotta have faith.

21:55.899 --> 21:59.611
Hey. Do you mind if I take off?
My parents are my ride.

22:02.406 --> 22:06.869
No. You gotta stay
and help with clean-up and locking up.

22:06.869 --> 22:09.413
You know, it really feels like
you should start paying me again.

22:09.413 --> 22:11.415
Yeah. Well, it's like they say,

22:11.415 --> 22:15.169
you can't always get exactly
what you're hoping for in this life.

22:20.007 --> 22:21.592
Hey, you need some help?

22:21.592 --> 22:24.803
Why? Because I'm a delicate little lady
who can't take care of herself?

22:25.554 --> 22:27.723
- No, I just thought you might--
- Of course, I want your help.

22:27.723 --> 22:29.016
What's wrong with you?

22:34.688 --> 22:36.899
All night I had all these people
coming up to me,

22:36.899 --> 22:39.401
asking me a million questions
about the machine,

22:39.401 --> 22:41.528
and all you can say is
that you don't wanna use it.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.114
Hey, if it works for people,
that's awesome.

22:45.157 --> 22:47.117
But I also think
there's a really good chance

22:47.117 --> 22:49.620
that a month from now,

22:50.537 --> 22:52.706
no one here
is gonna be talking about this.

22:52.706 --> 22:55.125
Now, see, I disagree.

22:55.125 --> 22:59.213
You never know what people will do
when they feel they've been given a sign.

22:59.755 --> 23:03.926
And that works for some people,
but just not for me, Father.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.762
Okay. If that's true, then...

23:08.722 --> 23:10.641
you might be the only person in this town

23:10.641 --> 23:12.601
who doesn't need anything from me.

23:15.187 --> 23:18.148
Oh, no. Who is responsible for this?

23:18.148 --> 23:19.399
I don't know, but--

23:20.359 --> 23:24.488
someone should really do something
about that. But don't grab--

23:24.488 --> 23:26.114
- Is this yours?
- All right. Look,

23:26.114 --> 23:27.491
it's an old playlist, okay?

23:27.491 --> 23:29.451
- This is a playlist?
- All right, relax.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.328
So much Coldplay, huh?

23:31.328 --> 23:33.789
Yeah, well, you like the Bible, so...

23:37.793 --> 23:39.127
Oh, man.

23:40.212 --> 23:41.213
What?

23:41.213 --> 23:45.551
"Still the One," Shania Twain.
Why you gotta do me like this, God?

23:45.551 --> 23:47.427
Okay. It's really not that bad.

23:47.427 --> 23:48.512
No.

23:50.514 --> 23:52.057
That was my wedding song.

23:55.227 --> 23:58.063
That was your wedding song?

23:58.063 --> 23:59.147
Yeah.

24:05.612 --> 24:11.869
I was married to an amazing woman.
And she met me when I was at my worst.

24:14.162 --> 24:17.958
She was like a ventilator.
She gave me life.

24:19.459 --> 24:24.506
And we were planning on having kids,
everything, had it all planned out.

24:25.632 --> 24:26.925
And then she got sick.

24:26.925 --> 24:30.554
Some really rare, invisible thing

24:30.554 --> 24:33.390
and then she was gone. Just...

24:37.477 --> 24:38.979
so fast.

24:40.939 --> 24:43.901
And I went all the way back down.

24:52.826 --> 24:55.204
And my drinking got really bad.

24:55.704 --> 24:58.790
I started punching random people,
you know, all the fun stuff.

24:58.790 --> 25:03.504
And I got to thinking,
"I don't come back from this."

25:04.338 --> 25:06.965
You know?
"People do not come back from this."

25:10.302 --> 25:15.349
And then I was outside of some random bar,

25:15.349 --> 25:18.435
just staring down in the gutter
like a real sack of shit

25:18.435 --> 25:21.772
and looking for something
to show me the way.

25:22.898 --> 25:27.611
And that's when I saw it.
"Your Life Potential."

25:38.497 --> 25:40.374
I mean, how's that for a sign, right?

25:40.374 --> 25:42.417
So, I did the whole seminary thing,

25:42.417 --> 25:45.087
and I took the job here at Deerfield High.

25:45.963 --> 25:47.172
Started over.

25:48.549 --> 25:52.135
And I carved out a new,
small life for myself and...

25:53.428 --> 25:54.805
and then this machine shows up,

25:54.805 --> 25:58.642
and I realize
the card wasn't meant for me.

26:00.519 --> 26:04.940
Everyone thinks that "Father"
means only one thing.

26:07.442 --> 26:09.736
Only I know that if it was supposed
to mean "Priest,"

26:09.736 --> 26:11.989
it would've said "Priest."

26:14.366 --> 26:15.826
And all this time, I...

26:18.453 --> 26:19.997
I've been on the wrong path.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.255
And on top of all that, I have to listen
to your terrible music.

26:36.054 --> 26:39.099
Wow. Yeah, this is so much better.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.352
Now, this is a wedding song.

26:53.614 --> 26:55.032
Are you fucking serious?

26:56.241 --> 26:57.534
Come on.
