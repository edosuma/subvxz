00:12.120 --> 00:14.634
Yeah, this is a story of famous dogs.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.911
For the dog that
chases its tail will be dizzy.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.756
Dog.

01:15.480 --> 01:19.359
- Hey, you. I left somethin' on your desk.
- I've got it.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.596
- Yo, man.
- Man, when are we gonna hang out?

01:21.720 --> 01:24.712
We gonna hang out soon.
Slow down with that thing, Bony.

01:24.840 --> 01:27.513
- Mornin', ladies.
- Hi, Marcus.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.997
- So I'm here on the right. I'm like this.
- Yo, man, I'm tryin' to work.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.588
- Hey. Whassup?
- Yo. Whassup?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.915
- I'll see y'all at lunch.
- OK. Peace.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.673
Good morning.
Hey, stranger, nice to see you again.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.031
Morning, cuteness.
How you doin'? Whassup?

01:46.160 --> 01:48.515
Morning. Morning. Morning.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.716
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.236
- Hey, you.
- Hello.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.670
- Morning, Noreen.
- Good morning, Marcus.

02:05.800 --> 02:09.997
Do me a favour and send a single
long-stemmed rose to Carrie, Tracy,

02:10.120 --> 02:13.908
Miranda, Cassandra,
Alegra, Shirrel and Mai-Lai.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.429
- With the usual card?
- "Thinking only of you."

02:16.560 --> 02:20.599
Right. You have a meeting
with Lady Eloise tomorrow at nine.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.156
- Cool.
- Nelson's waiting. And Anita called.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.796
I forgot.
Will you get her on the phone?

02:26.920 --> 02:28.239
- Sure.
- Thank you.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.637
- Nelson.
- Hello, Marcus.

02:30.760 --> 02:34.389
I can't wait to show you this.
I have recut the Kissable spot.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.914
You recut it? But is it sexy?

02:38.040 --> 02:40.315
Is it sexy?

02:40.440 --> 02:42.396
It is sexational.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.028
- I like it.
- Good.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.594
I like the orange,
and I like the ice cream.

03:30.720 --> 03:33.234
You gotta get rid of
the cherries and the banana.

03:33.360 --> 03:38.275
Cherry and banana? But that's a little
Buñuel, a little Dali. It's... you know.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.233
It's too overt.
We should go a little more subtle.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.999
- Some women might get offended.
- All right.

03:44.120 --> 03:47.749
But I dug it. I dug it. Don't make that
"he didn't dig it" face. I dug it.

03:47.880 --> 03:51.350
It just got a little nasty,
like you always do.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.713
- OK.
- All right.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.398
- Nasty Nelson.
- That's me.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.353
Least there wasn't
no sausages in this one.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.638
- Yeah?
- Anita on line one.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.716
Great.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.992
Hey, you.

04:09.120 --> 04:13.033
Let me... Can I explain what happened?
Have you been watching the news?

04:13.160 --> 04:16.152
You haven't been watching the news.
The big accident in midtown,

04:16.279 --> 04:18.475
where the cabs
busted into the other cab,

04:18.600 --> 04:21.478
it knocked into a bus
and a water main bust - I was in that.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.388
It's on the news right now. It just
went off Channel 4, just went off.

04:25.520 --> 04:28.592
Yeah, but I was...
No, I'm cool. I'm all right, yeah.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.393
No, my neck's a little stiff, that's all.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.440
Actually, a massage sounds kinda fly.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.553
Yeah, I'm all with that. That, too.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.913
Can I call you next week? Cool.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.478
Later.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.756
- What's next?
- Casting for the body lotion spot.

05:07.120 --> 05:10.795
Tell the fellas I might be
a little late for lunch today.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.509
Yo, man. I saw somethin'
on cable last night - freaked me.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.950
There was this woman, right?
Baby had body.

05:19.080 --> 05:23.358
She's lyin' there, totally naked, right?
You could see everything.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.436
But she had a dick, man.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.028
Fucked me up.

05:28.160 --> 05:31.197
It was a 976 number
for hermaphrodites.

05:31.320 --> 05:34.790
You're talkin' about 9-7-6-D-l-C-K,
Chicks With Dicks.

05:36.720 --> 05:40.508
How could you put that in your
mental Rolodex? He's a closet freak.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.631
- You got problems.
- You're comin' out.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.513
- Yeah.
- No, man, I was just, you know, kiddin'.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.990
Oh, man. That ain't regular, man.

05:48.120 --> 05:51.157
There's a whole world out there
we don't know about.

05:51.280 --> 05:54.716
<i>Like the shit you read in Penthouse -
that stuff never happens to me.</i>

05:54.840 --> 05:58.230
Man, stuff like that never happens
to anybody, except for Marcus.

05:58.360 --> 06:02.478
The only reason stuff like that happens
to me is I pay attention to women.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.114
- Y'all don't pay attention to women.
- I pay attention.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.629
- You have to study their movements.
- Get outta here.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.115
- It's an art form.
- I can't do that, man.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.196
- That's why you get no pussy.
- Exactly.

06:12.320 --> 06:15.949
Tyler, there's other things
in life besides sex.

06:16.080 --> 06:20.517
Sharing, commitment. You gotta get in
touch with your feminine side like me.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.996
Startin' to sound a little on the soft side.
Startin' to sound soft.

06:24.120 --> 06:27.476
- Borderline bitch.
- You know what your problem is?

06:27.600 --> 06:30.876
You need more romance
and less Doberman pinscher.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.151
That's true. You have
too much dog and no romance.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.354
Don't even try that.
You ain't got no romance.

06:38.080 --> 06:41.993
Excuse me. I am the most romantic cat
both of you know.

06:44.360 --> 06:48.035
When I meet a woman, I am flowers,
I am candy, I am soft music...

06:48.160 --> 06:49.991
And Mr Milk-Bones.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.475
I am Mr Romance
when I meet a woman.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.239
Once I hit it, I lose interest.
But that ain't my fault.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.318
So, in other words,
right at that moment of orgasm,

06:58.440 --> 07:00.590
all the romance just
skeets right outta you.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.757
No, but you can't put that on me.
The onus is not on me.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.199
- Hi.
- How are you?

07:05.320 --> 07:07.356
- Good.
- You have a beautiful accent.

07:07.480 --> 07:10.040
- Where are you from?
- Holland. Nice meeting you.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.752
- Nice meeting you, too.
- Bye.

07:11.880 --> 07:13.871
Bye-bye, cuteness.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.991
I'm from Detroit.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.669
Shit, that shit makes me mad, man.
Bitches never do that to me, man.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.389
Maybe it's because
you call them bitches.

07:22.520 --> 07:26.229
Yeah, man. You need to straighten up,
show some respect, man. Come on.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.636
Yo, man. Excuse me.
Excuse me, waitress.

07:29.760 --> 07:33.070
- Yeah.
- Look, I ordered the duck, right?

07:33.200 --> 07:35.919
- Yeah.
- What vegetable comes with that?

07:36.080 --> 07:40.676
That's a good one. It's sautéed
asparagus spears, and it is good.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.278
- Flavour.
- Delicious. Yeah.

07:43.400 --> 07:46.517
- That sounds good. Oh, God.
- You'll love 'em.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.517
- All right.
- That sounds good.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.676
- "That sounds good." Come on.
- What?

07:50.800 --> 07:53.872
Why don't she just come out
and call us jungle bunnies?

07:54.240 --> 07:55.753
- What?
- Asparagus spears.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.958
- What?
- For white guys, it'd be asparagus tips.

07:59.080 --> 08:01.833
- Racial, man. Racial.
- Man, you trippin' now.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.999
- No, you trippin'.
- Definitely, definitely. No, you def...

08:09.680 --> 08:12.877
You are gonna have to process
some of this anger, man.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.638
- No.
- Yo...

08:15.000 --> 08:17.150
- Y'all excuse me.
- You know what?

08:17.280 --> 08:20.590
You need to get in touch with Tyler,
and say "Tyler, I love you, man".

08:20.720 --> 08:22.278
What? Nigger, please.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.830
OK, go take your walk, honey.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.389
I'll give you $20 for that leash.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.715
Take it, fool. Turnin' down good money.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.395
Yes, baby.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.038
Kirby.

08:40.159 --> 08:41.717
Kirby.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.034
Come on, Kirb.

08:44.159 --> 08:47.357
- Kirby.
- Did you lose your dog?

08:47.480 --> 08:51.439
Yeah, I lost a white springer spaniel
with brown spots on, named Kirby.

08:51.560 --> 08:55.348
- Real energetic dog. Did you see him?
- I haven't seen him.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.074
I only took him off the leash
for a couple of seconds.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.111
Kirby.

09:00.240 --> 09:04.028
- He's like a family member, you know?
- I know. I feel the same about Brutus.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.196
- I love my Brutus.
- I can see why.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.436
- Do you walk him here every day?
- Yeah, I do.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.836
Could you do me a favour? My name is
Marcus Graham. Here's my card.

09:11.960 --> 09:15.396
If you bump into Kirby, could you call?
I'll have somebody pick him up.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.954
OK. Well, good luck.
I sure hope you find him.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.433
Thanks.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.152
Kirb.

09:21.280 --> 09:22.872
Kirby.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.959
Let me give you my number. I won't
sleep until I know you've found him.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.230
- Do you have a pen?
- Do I?

09:30.720 --> 09:33.439
I have a pen right here, and...

09:35.840 --> 09:36.795
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

09:36.920 --> 09:37.796
- Bye-bye.
- Good luck.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.478
Bye-bye.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.398
Kirby?

09:42.520 --> 09:44.033
Kirb?

09:44.160 --> 09:45.718
Kirbster?

09:50.880 --> 09:52.393
Marcus. Marcus.

09:52.520 --> 09:57.514
I know you hear me, you slimy, sleazy,
sneaky, slitherin' son of a bitch.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.598
Keep it down. I'm gettin' ready
to have some company, OK?

10:00.720 --> 10:05.236
- So, who's the victim tonight?
- Yvonne, I don't feel like playin'. Stop.

10:05.600 --> 10:10.037
Why don't you just tell her you're gonna
use her, then dump her like you did me?

10:10.160 --> 10:12.958
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I did not dump you.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.231
We went out, it was whack,
and it was your fault, and I wish...

10:16.360 --> 10:20.194
Look, why don't you get over it and go
find another man? Get outta here.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.359
I hope you catch a disease
and your dick falls off.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.153
I'd expect you to say something crass.

10:27.960 --> 10:31.236
Don't forget I have the court order
for you to stay away.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.033
- I'm gonna call your probation officer.
- Court order?

10:34.160 --> 10:36.833
I don't give a damn
about no court order.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.236
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.638
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you, too.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.995
- Wow. Nice place.
- Thank you.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.317
- Where's Kirby? Kirby. Kirby.
- He's at the groomer's.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.671
He got caught under a truck
and got grease on his coat. He's OK.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.109
- You look great.
- Thank you.

11:00.640 --> 11:03.871
Gold star for Marcus.
Dinner was yummy.

11:05.840 --> 11:10.072
I never met a man who cooked so well.
How'd you learn how to cook like that?

11:10.560 --> 11:14.951
Well, you kinda pick those things up,
you know, when you're...

11:15.080 --> 11:17.389
when you're alone as much as I am.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.078
Really?

11:20.840 --> 11:22.751
Yeah. See...

11:22.880 --> 11:24.313
Marcus.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.908
Marcus, you know you wrong.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.600
You no-good... Marcus.

11:30.960 --> 11:35.750
Let's go in the living room. We'll be
much more comfortable in there.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.030
- OK.
- Come on.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.112
Girlfriend.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.312
Girlfriend.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.113
Girlfriend.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.956
Knock, knock.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.879
- Who's there?
- A scared little boy named Marcus.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.833
And he's just dying to come out.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.713
He's been hurt, too, hasn't he?

12:02.840 --> 12:06.879
Tell me about him.
Tell me all about Marcus.

12:12.040 --> 12:16.591
Well, I haven't been out with anybody
in about two years.

12:16.720 --> 12:20.156
Not since Debra -
that's the girl I almost married.

12:21.040 --> 12:25.750
Day of my wedding, I went to the
church early, cos I had a bad feeling,

12:25.880 --> 12:30.908
and I go in the back,
and that's when I saw it.

12:31.040 --> 12:34.157
She was on the ground
with the best man.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.116
And the priest.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.352
Freakin'.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.436
You poor baby.

12:44.320 --> 12:48.552
Yeah, that's when I realised
that you can't trust anybody.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.236
You can trust me.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.350
I'm not ready for this.

13:01.680 --> 13:05.116
I think I should take you home.
I think it's best.

13:07.760 --> 13:10.911
I can't tell you how helpful this
has been. Gold star for Christie.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.077
Thanks. You really
helped me in here. I felt that.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.590
- You don't have to thank me. Come on.
- No, no, I shouldn't come in.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.474
- Come on.
- Christie, don't. I shouldn't be in here.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.068
I'm not ready for this.
Are we by ourselves?

13:24.200 --> 13:27.476
- Of course we're by ourselves.
- Christie.

13:28.400 --> 13:33.554
- Marcus, spend the night with me.
- Christie, no, it's just too soon. I c...

13:40.960 --> 13:43.315
I just don't wanna be hurt again.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.910
I won't hurt you.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.716
Please be gentle.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.709
- So what happened with this girl?
- Man, she was beautiful.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.673
She was beautiful,
but her feet were jacked up.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.712
- Were they?
- Yeah. I pulled the covers back...

14:53.840 --> 14:55.478
- Yeah?
- ..it was Hammer time.

14:55.600 --> 14:59.275
I should've known. I seen
her shoes had little bumps on the top,

14:59.400 --> 15:01.516
but I thought it was an old shoe.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.872
You'd never think a woman that fine
would have Hammer time in her shoe.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.070
Come on, man, you don't fuck her feet.

15:08.200 --> 15:12.557
I hope I'm not outta line, but don't you
think you were just a little bit too picky?

15:12.680 --> 15:14.636
- Yeah.
- What happened with Tracy?

15:14.760 --> 15:17.399
You met that girl.
She's not very smart.

15:17.520 --> 15:21.229
- Come on, you don't fuck her brains.
- I'm looking for perfection.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.876
- Hi, Marcus.
- Hey.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.318
- Yo, Marcus.
- What's up?

15:29.440 --> 15:32.989
Hey, you on your way to meet Lady
Eloise to discuss that merger, right?

15:33.120 --> 15:36.271
- How do you know everything?
- I read it in your office.

15:36.400 --> 15:40.518
You not supposed to be in my office,
or goin' through my mail, OK?

15:40.640 --> 15:45.350
No, man, I wasn't goin' through your
stuff, man. Here. Hold it up. Hold it up.

15:45.480 --> 15:48.199
- You're gonna read right through?
- Right through.

15:48.320 --> 15:51.710
It says "..lunch tomorrow

15:51.840 --> 15:53.831
at Houlihan's".

15:54.520 --> 15:56.112
Open it up.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.155
"How about lunch at Hou..."
v ery impressive.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.432
Told you, man. Told you, man.
Check this out, man.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.516
I been workin' here nine days.

16:05.640 --> 16:10.350
I been on time, even when it rains. Don't
you think it's time we talked promotion?

16:11.880 --> 16:14.917
Come on, man. I get my own office,
man, bring my ho's in here.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.191
We have a little party,
set this motherfucker off, man.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.236
Marcus Graham.

16:24.480 --> 16:28.598
Lady Eloise? I can't tell you how
excited you got everybody up here.

16:28.720 --> 16:32.838
You're like a breath of fresh air. I've
never seen everybody so excited. It's...

16:34.520 --> 16:39.548
Lady Eloise? I think you requested
to see me. Marcus Graham.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.636
I know.

16:43.280 --> 16:45.840
- May I have a seat?
- Please.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.428
Keep standing.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.235
The rest of my administrative team
will be arriving tomorrow.

16:52.360 --> 16:56.319
However, when I decided
to take over this company,

16:56.440 --> 16:58.874
I considered you a prime asset.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.274
Thank you very much.

17:02.400 --> 17:07.758
We need strong department heads
to oversee this merger.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.349
- Beet juice?
- No, thank you.

17:13.599 --> 17:18.435
It keeps the skin tight,
and none of us are getting any younger.

17:19.640 --> 17:23.713
Well, some women have a girlish
quality that lasts a lifetime.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.436
I've always heard you were
very beguiling to women.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.115
But my schedule is also very tight.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.350
Meet me at my house tonight.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.839
Todd, see to it that
he's at Lavender Hill.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.996
- Good evening, Mr Graham.
- Good evening.

17:49.120 --> 17:52.271
Lady Eloise has been
eagerly anticipating you.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.954
Marcus Graham, Lady Eloise.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.630
Marcus, darling.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.670
Welcome to Lavender Hill.

18:25.560 --> 18:30.554
Lady Eloise, I cannot begin to tell you
how happy I am to be working with you.

18:30.680 --> 18:34.639
I grew up using your products - my
mother used your products, you know.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.069
You were in my medicine
cabinet all my life,

18:37.200 --> 18:41.239
and now I'm, like, working with you,
and it's just very exciting.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.275
I find it very exciting as well.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.917
I'm lookin' forward to a long,
strong, productive relationship.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.837
You know, I don't wanna
blow my own horn...

19:00.280 --> 19:02.430
but I'm really qualified.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.917
You shouldn't have to
blow your own horn.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.918
You should leave that
for someone else to do.

19:24.080 --> 19:28.437
Marcus, darling.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.711
Wouldn't you like to
get a little bit more...

19:43.880 --> 19:45.836
comfortable?

19:45.960 --> 19:48.076
Yeah, sure, why not?

20:12.680 --> 20:16.673
Wouldn't you like to
get out of that tight shirt?

20:16.800 --> 20:20.236
Yeah, I was just
thinking about doin' it myself.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.913
You know, it's a little bright in here.

20:25.040 --> 20:28.999
Wouldn't you like to dim it, make it
a little more romantic, you know?

20:44.440 --> 20:46.954
Could you get it just a little darker?

21:32.480 --> 21:36.837
Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you,
but I just had to say somethin' to you.

21:36.960 --> 21:40.748
You're breathtaking. You're the most
gorgeous woman I've ever laid eyes on.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.235
I had to come over and meet you.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.470
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you laughing?

21:46.600 --> 21:51.720
I'm sorry, it's just that
what you said was pretty pathetic.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.991
- That was not pathetic.
- Come on.

21:54.120 --> 21:56.475
I mean, if I walked up to you and I said

21:56.600 --> 22:01.276
"Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry to bother
you, but, well, I just had to meet you

22:01.400 --> 22:04.995
because you are the most handsome,

22:05.120 --> 22:10.956
the most virile man I have ever seen
in all of my entire life,"

22:11.080 --> 22:13.355
now, would you believe me?

22:14.040 --> 22:18.477
Honestly? Yeah, I would,
but that's just the way I am.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.548
- I'm going to work.
- OK.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.353
- OK.
- Well, I'm goin' this way, too.

22:24.960 --> 22:28.953
It's not like I'm followin' you.
I'm goin' upstairs too.

22:29.080 --> 22:30.991
I'm goin' to the 18th floor, too.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.396
You're auditioning for one of
the commercials. Are you a model?

22:34.520 --> 22:38.229
No. No, I'm not a model.
I'm gonna go work for the company.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.396
- Really?
- Marketing, yeah.

22:40.520 --> 22:44.069
Really? That's my department.
I'm Marcus Graham.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.475
You're Marcus Graham?
You're Marcus Graham?

22:46.800 --> 22:49.997
This is pretty funny
that we're meeting like this.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.395
- I'm sorry, I'm Jacqueline Broyer.
- OK.

22:52.520 --> 22:55.671
- I'm a huge fan of your work.
- Thank you very much.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.916
You're very, very talented.

22:58.040 --> 23:01.396
You was treatin' me like my name was
Stanley. But you're a fan of my work.

23:01.520 --> 23:04.080
I'll let you in on a secret
cos you're a pretty girl.

23:04.200 --> 23:08.955
When this merger goes through, I'm
gonna be in charge of all of marketing.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.593
You are?

23:10.720 --> 23:15.635
Marcus, I'm afraid that there's been
some kind of misunderstanding.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.718
I'm sorry. You see,
I'm in charge of marketing.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.675
No, that's impossible.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.358
Sorry.

23:26.240 --> 23:29.630
I'm the logical choice. I'm vice
President of Marketing for Chantress.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.352
Good morning. Thank you.

23:31.480 --> 23:35.632
I know, but I'm director of marketing for
Lady Eloise, and we are acquiring you.

23:35.760 --> 23:39.036
But I had a very good indication
from someone that the job was mine.

23:39.160 --> 23:43.711
- Really? From whom?
- From Lady Eloise. Lady Eloise.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.637
- Really?
- Yes.

23:45.760 --> 23:49.230
Marcus, Lady Eloise
doesn't make any decisions.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.397
She's the name on the package.

23:52.520 --> 23:56.832
- No, it's her company. The Lady Eloise.
- She hasn't run it for 15 years.

23:56.960 --> 24:01.590
All of the decisions are made
by the board of directors in Paris.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.915
But it's Lady Eloise.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.600
She has no power.

24:07.880 --> 24:13.034
She's a very sweet woman.
She's a little detached from reality.

24:13.680 --> 24:17.036
You should see the way she just...
she throws herself

24:17.160 --> 24:21.039
at young, handsome, virile men.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.874
Are you tryin' to imply that I hit it?
No, I see...

24:24.000 --> 24:28.630
- Marcus, darling.
- How you doin', Lady Eloise?

24:29.920 --> 24:33.151
I don't have any panties on.

24:33.280 --> 24:37.637
Lady Eloise, please, we have a meeting.
Can we just please go?

24:41.760 --> 24:43.751
I'm sorry.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.871
It's warm in here.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.676
Just cos somebody takes off their
drawers, don't mean I did somethin'.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.913
- So, yo, man, you gonna quit, right?
- Of course he's gonna quit, man.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.508
That's right. Say
"Look, girl, I'm outta there".

25:08.640 --> 25:10.835
That's what I'm thinkin' about doin'.

25:10.960 --> 25:15.511
I'm thinkin' about steppin'...
There she is, right there.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.596
- That's her?
- Yeah.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.837
Psych. Yo, you can't quit, man.
You gotta stay.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.428
- Yeah, she's bad.
- Hello, Marcus.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.631
- Hello, Jacqueline.
- You look great.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.318
- And so do you.
- Thank you.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.512
This is my man Tyler,
and this is Gerard. Jacqueline.

25:31.640 --> 25:35.474
This is Angela Lewis. She works in
our art department. She's very talented.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.751
I think the two of you should
probably be working together.

25:38.880 --> 25:43.237
- Excuse me, Jacqueline. It's that time.
- Thank you, Todd. Nice meeting you.

25:43.360 --> 25:46.477
Marcus, would you join me
for a second? Thanks.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.869
Come on, girl. Get on.

25:50.560 --> 25:53.870
Ladies and gentlemen, I have
a very exciting announcement to make.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.154
Since 1948, the name Lady Eloise has
been synonymous with glamour, grace,

25:59.280 --> 26:02.397
sensuality, and stunning natural beauty.

26:03.480 --> 26:06.836
In the next century,
that tradition continues.

26:06.960 --> 26:11.750
Introducing the new face
of Lady Eloise cosmetics: Strangé.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.838
Yes.

28:11.160 --> 28:12.878
- Hey.
- Hi.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.594
- How are you?
- Good. You look lost. Can I help you?

28:15.720 --> 28:19.872
I'm just looking for Jacqueline,
basically, is what I'm doing.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.389
You're interested in her, right?

28:22.520 --> 28:27.275
- Now, what would make you say that?
- Most men are. She's fantastic.

28:28.280 --> 28:31.989
I mean, if I were a guy, I would
probably be interested in Jacqueline.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.714
- If you were a guy.
- Not that I have those thoughts,

28:34.840 --> 28:39.436
because I don't, I'm just saying she's
attractive and I would go out with her.

28:39.560 --> 28:43.997
Women do stuff like that. You say
"She's cute" or "Her hair's nice",

28:44.120 --> 28:47.669
but guys don't go "Look at his
shoulders". We don't do that.

28:47.800 --> 28:51.588
Sure you have. You've seen a movie,
and you've seen a man and you've said

28:51.720 --> 28:53.870
"There is a nice-looking man."
You have.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.719
I can't believe we're havin'
this conversation.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.308
<i>I saw Billy Dee Williams
in Lady Sings the Blues.</i>

28:59.440 --> 29:02.273
He came down the steps,
and I thought he was cool,

29:02.400 --> 29:06.837
but I didn't wanna get with him,
you know. That's a whole entire...

29:07.640 --> 29:09.710
Wait, I have someone you should meet.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.559
Gerard. I think I met someone
that's perfect for you.

29:12.680 --> 29:15.274
Why don't you guys come chitchat? I...

29:19.560 --> 29:20.913
Hi.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.751
Good evening, boss.

29:31.880 --> 29:34.235
Please do not call me that.

29:35.880 --> 29:39.031
I want you to think of me
as your colleague.

29:39.160 --> 29:43.233
So tell me something. Are you excited
about working with Strangé?

29:45.840 --> 29:49.116
Stop. You know I didn't come up here
to talk about no Strangé.

29:49.240 --> 29:51.231
I came up here to talk to you about us.

29:51.360 --> 29:55.751
I'm rapping. This is my mack-daddy vibe
I'm giving you, in all of its splendour.

29:55.880 --> 29:57.313
- What's up?
- Really?

29:57.440 --> 30:00.273
<i>Yes. I mean, eleganz a
mack daddy of the month.</i>

30:01.000 --> 30:04.310
I see. Well, let me get a good look.

30:04.880 --> 30:07.394
<i>Check it. Just like Jet magazine.</i>

30:08.640 --> 30:11.916
- Whassup?
- You are absolutely wonderful.

30:14.280 --> 30:18.273
But I think that we should kind of
make this clear right from the start,

30:18.400 --> 30:20.755
so there's no misunderstanding.

30:21.680 --> 30:26.515
You see, I don't date men I work with.

30:27.840 --> 30:31.071
- Well, then, I quit.
- You can't quit

30:31.200 --> 30:33.953
because I need you.

30:38.440 --> 30:40.510
No, hon, wait one sec.

30:40.640 --> 30:44.428
You have an eyelash. It's gonna
go in your eye. Wait. Come here.

30:48.360 --> 30:50.510
- Are you all right? Huh?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.312
- Tryin' to seduce me.
- What?

30:52.440 --> 30:54.590
- That was very seductive.
- What?

30:54.720 --> 30:56.950
- You know...
- You had something in your eye.

30:57.080 --> 31:00.072
- I saved your eye.
- No, no, no, no, no.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.873
I know what it's like when
you have somethin' in your eye.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.117
Your mother opens your eye and blows.
Your eyeball comes out.

31:06.240 --> 31:09.516
It was never like you just did.
Come on. That was very seductive.

31:09.640 --> 31:12.916
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no. No.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.600
And let me assure you of something.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.589
When I seduce you,

31:19.720 --> 31:22.757
if I decide to seduce you,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.753
don't worry, you'll know.

31:38.760 --> 31:40.512
- Yo, Marcus.
- Hey, man.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.234
Me and the minimum-wage
brothers in the mailroom

31:43.360 --> 31:47.512
wanna know how long do you think it'll
take you to bone that new executrix.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.473
I need to know cos we got
a little office-pool thing.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.592
Look, that's very crass.
Miss Broyer and I are colleagues,

31:53.720 --> 31:58.669
and I have great respect for her.
It's professional. Totally professional.

32:00.560 --> 32:03.120
So what you sayin', man?
It's gonna take a week?

32:03.240 --> 32:05.037
Not you, Marcus, you the man.

32:18.480 --> 32:22.189
- I hate it.
- But this fragrance tested very well.

32:22.320 --> 32:26.518
Jacqueline, I said I wanted
the essence of sex.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.632
- Yes.
- Well, I think this is it.

32:29.760 --> 32:31.955
You would.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.230
But let me show you...

32:35.200 --> 32:38.158
what I'm talking about.

32:39.240 --> 32:41.549
- Unbelievable.
- This...

32:43.320 --> 32:48.075
is the essence of sex.

32:56.680 --> 33:01.708
Lloyd. Come on, Lloyd. Wait, Lloyd.
Lloyd, man. Lloyd.

33:03.680 --> 33:07.229
Lloyd, look, wait. Look, wait, hold it.
Come on, man. Wait, wait, wait.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.874
The fragrance is fine.
Nobody's changin' anything.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.355
That woman doesn't
deserve her own fragrance.

33:12.480 --> 33:15.711
Do you think Liz Taylor would have
thrown her panties in my face?

33:15.840 --> 33:18.832
You could ask her, Lloyd.
Look, it was a joke.

33:18.960 --> 33:23.750
I'm just tryin' to be... I'm being funny.
Come on, look... All right, Lloyd?

33:24.680 --> 33:27.752
Marcus. You're a devil.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.155
I love you. Come on back.

33:32.480 --> 33:36.268
Please! You make me feel ridiculous.

33:36.400 --> 33:41.918
<i>It's mon image, c'est mon visage.
Alors. And you, where you been, you?</i>

33:42.040 --> 33:45.237
- I had to go...
- Shut up. Look at this.

33:45.360 --> 33:50.115
This is ridiculous.
Why are my concepts being ignored?

33:51.040 --> 33:53.838
I'm not a fool.
I know what the people want.

33:53.960 --> 33:59.080
They want to be shocked, they want to
be stunned, and they want to be jolted.

33:59.200 --> 34:03.830
So, I have prepared a list
of names for the fragrance.

34:07.760 --> 34:11.389
"Wet Spot". No, sorry.
I crossed out that one.

34:11.520 --> 34:15.228
"Love Puss". "Pig Puke".

34:15.360 --> 34:17.315
- "Afterbirth".
- After what?

34:17.639 --> 34:20.234
"Afterbirth".

34:20.360 --> 34:26.310
- I'm sorry, I thought you said "bath".
- No. It's English. B-l-R-T-H. Birth.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.193
I was just making a distinction
between "birth" or "bath".

34:29.320 --> 34:32.516
- Birth, birth, birth.
- Thank you, darling.

34:32.639 --> 34:36.632
Don't make fun of me, OK?
My English is not so good.

34:37.280 --> 34:39.157
"Steel v agina".

34:39.280 --> 34:41.271
- You understand that one.
- Yeah.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.119
"Steel v agina" - marvellous.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.955
What do you think?

34:48.600 --> 34:51.831
- I...
- Those are really creative.

34:51.960 --> 34:54.110
- Thank you.
- But the name of this fragrance

34:54.239 --> 34:57.949
has to be something
that catches the eye.

34:58.080 --> 35:02.198
It has to incite passion,
and it has be electric,

35:02.320 --> 35:05.312
and it has to say glamour,
and it has to say sexy.

35:05.440 --> 35:08.637
It has to say smart. It has to...

35:09.680 --> 35:11.830
Wait a minute.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.317
Strangé.
Your name is all of those things.

35:15.440 --> 35:19.069
You're powerful, you're glamorous,
you're sexy, you're intelligent.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.033
That's what we should call
the perf... Strangé. Strangé.

35:22.160 --> 35:23.752
- Strangé.
- Strangé.

35:23.880 --> 35:25.677
- Strangé.
- Strangé.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.076
OK, OK, OK, OK.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.112
- I like it.
- Strangé.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.196
Strangé.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.951
Strut, girl, strut.

35:37.680 --> 35:40.274
Go on, girl. It's you, girl.

35:40.400 --> 35:43.198
Work it, girl. Strangé girl.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.039
Thank you for introducing me
to Gerard. We're goin' out tonight.

35:48.160 --> 35:51.550
Now, that's some good news.
That's good news. Great.

35:52.480 --> 35:55.358
You do realise we're never
gonna be able to control her.

35:55.480 --> 35:59.234
Why would you wanna control Strangé?
We'll get more coverage that way.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.430
Strangé is buck wild.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.755
Yes, you're probably right.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.352
We've got this meeting
in New Orleans on the 24th.

36:07.480 --> 36:12.315
All of the sales reps are gonna be there.
There's a lot of work to be done.

36:12.440 --> 36:16.115
Yeah. OK, so, we'll have dinner
or somethin', go over it.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.310
Marcus.

36:18.440 --> 36:19.589
- What?
- Come on.

36:19.720 --> 36:23.349
Stop. Excuse me. Excuse me.
You're... Wait a minute, wait a minute.

36:23.480 --> 36:26.233
If we were both men,
we could have a business dinner.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.750
You're the one flippin' this into
a man-woman thing. I said dinner,

36:29.880 --> 36:34.476
and let's discuss our workload.
That's what I'm talking about.

36:34.600 --> 36:37.876
- Just dinner?
- Just our workload over a meal.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.831
We've got a hell of a load.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.235
- OK.
- Dinner?

36:43.360 --> 36:46.352
- Dinner.
- OK, I'll see you at dinner.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.276
Great.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.832
- Hey.
- Hey. You're here. I was gonna leave.

37:23.960 --> 37:27.919
- I didn't think anyone was home.
- I'm sorry. I dozed off.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.956
Come on in.

37:31.840 --> 37:36.197
- You look great. You're all dressed up.
- You're lookin' casually fine tonight.

37:36.320 --> 37:39.073
- Let me get that coat for you.
- Thank you.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.876
v ery nice.

37:43.480 --> 37:47.792
Marcus, this is a very nice place
you have here.

37:47.920 --> 37:51.390
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Check out over here.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.990
- That's a big, wonderful bed.
- Yeah, well, I need my space.

37:55.120 --> 37:57.953
- Yeah.
- Cool. Music.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.593
Have a look around.
Go check out upstairs.

38:12.680 --> 38:15.478
What you're trying to say is,
Marcus is a...

38:15.600 --> 38:18.353
A ho. He's a straight-up ho.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.876
- Don't... Come on, stop.
- He's a no-good barking mutt.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.514
- Really?
- Nothin' really happened between us...

38:28.640 --> 38:30.835
- She's crazy.
- No, this is very interesting.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.030
- She's bugged.
- v ery interesting.

38:33.160 --> 38:36.789
I ain't crazy. Hey, girlfriend.
Don't let him do it to you. He got a plan.

38:36.920 --> 38:40.549
What, you 'bout my size, my height,
my weight? Doggy style.

38:40.680 --> 38:46.038
Doggy style. I know, girlfriend. I'm tryin'
to help you out. It's a sister thing.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.149
Damn.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.038
- Wow, you look great.
- Thank you.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.836
You look neat.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.518
- Thanks.
- Come on in.

39:00.640 --> 39:03.154
- Yeah. These are for you.
- Thank you.

39:04.120 --> 39:08.033
This is wild. Man, did you do
all the decoration yourself?

39:08.160 --> 39:11.152
Every bit. I know you think
it's a little weird...

39:11.280 --> 39:12.838
- No, no, no.
- It's really...

39:12.960 --> 39:16.191
- It's eclectic. Yeah.
- Eclectic, yeah.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.754
- So you like it?
- v ery interesting.

39:21.680 --> 39:25.389
That's a mask, a Goli mask.
I got it from Africa.

39:25.520 --> 39:28.318
That's weird. I didn't know
Africans were into hockey.

39:28.440 --> 39:32.513
No, no, no, no, no.
Goli is the name of the tribe. The tribe.

39:32.640 --> 39:35.154
It's a joke.

39:38.480 --> 39:43.315
You know, the secret to my salmon is
the rosemary in the butter sauce. Cos...

39:43.440 --> 39:45.431
Excuse me?
You were saying something?

39:45.560 --> 39:48.632
I use fresh rosemary on my salmon.
That's why it has that...

39:48.760 --> 39:53.356
I'm sorry, Marcus.
My mind is actually someplace else.

39:53.480 --> 39:58.031
The Knicks game starts in a minute. Do
you mind if we eat in front of the Tv?

39:59.400 --> 40:01.755
- No, not at all. Sure.
- No? Great.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.239
OK, do you want Italian, or Indian?

40:06.360 --> 40:09.716
- So, like, women like guys that just...
- Yeah. Decide.

40:09.840 --> 40:15.392
All right, I'm gonna decide.
I will choose Chinese.

40:15.520 --> 40:18.318
- No.
- That's cool. Whatever you say.

40:18.440 --> 40:19.998
Sorry.

40:21.960 --> 40:26.078
- I'm bein' indecisive.
- Yes. You're being indecisive.

40:27.840 --> 40:30.229
Can I ask you, like,
a personal question?

40:30.360 --> 40:32.237
- Sure.
- Do you like kids?

40:32.360 --> 40:34.920
I love kids. I paint kids.

40:35.040 --> 40:38.077
So, do you wanna have a lot
of kids when you get married?

40:38.200 --> 40:41.749
I want a huge family.
At least ten children.

40:41.880 --> 40:44.030
Ten children?

40:44.160 --> 40:46.879
That's not a family.
That's an African village.

40:47.640 --> 40:51.269
This is absolutely ridiculous. Are you
watchin' this? This is incredible.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.833
I'm goin' to get some espresso.
You want some?

40:59.960 --> 41:01.916
No. No, no, thanks.

41:06.160 --> 41:10.950
Listen, Marcus. While you're up,
will you grab me a beer?

41:11.400 --> 41:12.992
Thanks.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.590
All right, I had a wonderful evening.

41:18.720 --> 41:21.518
- Thank you. So did I.
- Even though we never got to eat.

41:21.640 --> 41:24.313
I know, but next time,
I'll take control. I'll order.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.317
- So, next week, dinner?
- You got it.

41:26.440 --> 41:30.831
Followed by hot, butt-naked sex?
Just kidding. I'm just kidding.

41:32.360 --> 41:36.717
So, now's the most difficult
part of the evening. Kiss goodnight.

41:36.840 --> 41:42.233
I know. But I got an idea. Count from
five backwards real fast, and go for it.

41:42.360 --> 41:44.316
- All right. Close your eyes.
- Go.

41:44.440 --> 41:46.795
Five, four, three, two, one, go.

41:47.320 --> 41:49.311
God, I'm sorry. I missed.

41:49.440 --> 41:52.034
- I guess I'll have to do it again.
- No. I'll do it.

41:52.160 --> 41:53.593
OK.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.358
- Goodbye.
- Night, Angela.

41:56.480 --> 41:59.074
- Night. Thank you.
- See you next week.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.111
Bye.

42:01.240 --> 42:02.753
Adios.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.197
Bye.

42:09.920 --> 42:13.879
It's Korean for "I'm sorry I shot you, but
I thought you were robbing my store".

42:14.000 --> 42:15.956
Bye-bye.

42:22.280 --> 42:24.635
What an incredible evening.

42:24.760 --> 42:28.753
Did you see Jordan's last shot?
The man must've been 60ft up, huh?

42:29.360 --> 42:31.749
Yeah, he really can jump.

42:34.800 --> 42:37.314
Want me to come get a cab
with you or somethin'?

42:37.440 --> 42:39.590
No. No. I'm fine.

42:40.320 --> 42:44.950
- But you can walk me to the elevator.
- What a treat.

42:48.360 --> 42:53.275
- Yo, man, she a lesbo.
- Man, the term is gay, all right, Tyler?

42:53.400 --> 42:56.278
Just cos she won't sleep with you
doesn't mean she's gay.

42:56.400 --> 43:00.313
- She's not a lesbian, OK?
- Yo, man, it's been about three weeks.

43:00.440 --> 43:02.237
She's not a lesbian, man.

43:02.360 --> 43:06.956
Personally, if I was datin' somebody
that fine, I'd wait eight or nine months.

43:07.080 --> 43:12.154
You could wait eight or nine years and
you'd never have no woman that fine.

43:14.520 --> 43:19.674
You wild. But at least my lady didn't
leave me for no damn Guardian Angel.

43:19.800 --> 43:24.351
Why you do that, man? I'd have fucked
him up but they do that karate shit.

43:24.480 --> 43:27.438
Come on, stop. You gonna
give the brother a heart attack.

43:27.560 --> 43:32.395
- Breathe. Let the brother relax.
- I'm sorry, man. I was just playin'.

43:32.520 --> 43:35.990
Can I ask you somethin' though, man?
Did you bang Angela yet?

43:36.120 --> 43:37.838
Good question. Good question.

43:37.960 --> 43:41.839
Angela and I are just tryin' to get to
know each other on a platonic level.

43:42.080 --> 43:45.231
OK. So, in other words,
you ain't hit the twizzer.

43:45.360 --> 43:47.476
- Not a drop.
- Twizzer? What's that?

43:47.600 --> 43:51.354
Another one of your colloquialisms
for a vagina, Tyler?

43:51.480 --> 43:56.315
You think, just cos I have a low sperm
count, that I can't function normally.

43:56.440 --> 44:00.274
But I don't know why it's low. It should
be high. You ain't shootin' nothin'.

44:00.400 --> 44:04.678
Man, will you stop? You shouldn't make
fun of the afflicted. He got a problem.

44:04.800 --> 44:07.758
- He got handicapped balls.
- Stop that, man.

44:07.880 --> 44:11.919
A very well-known doctor told me that
by wearing the proper underwear, man,

44:12.040 --> 44:15.430
that will cool my testicle walls,
and that can reverse my condition.

44:15.560 --> 44:18.870
OK. Well, let me get you some Icy Hot.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.197
Howdy Doody.
At least I have had sex in the '90s.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.792
- What's that?
- You know what.

44:26.920 --> 44:30.196
- Don't even try. You know I gets mine.
- Brother, please.

44:30.320 --> 44:33.756
You are the no-pussy-gettingest,
talkingest-shittingest cat I know.

44:33.880 --> 44:37.270
Marcus, yo, don't even try it.
You know me, for real.

44:37.400 --> 44:40.392
And all I'm sayin' is that
if you ain't bangin' Jacqueline yet,

44:40.520 --> 44:43.990
there's somethin' wrong with her,
or somethin' wrong with her twizzer.

44:44.120 --> 44:47.430
There's nothin' wrong with Jacqueline,
and nothin' wrong with me.

44:47.560 --> 44:50.313
It's gonna take
a little longer than I thought.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.751
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

44:59.880 --> 45:03.509
These sales conventions are really
boring. I'm not lookin' forward to it.

45:03.640 --> 45:07.315
Yeah, but we're going to New Orleans.
Have you ever been to New Orleans?

45:07.440 --> 45:10.796
No. It seems like it's a sexy town.

45:11.840 --> 45:15.276
Yeah, it's a real... it's a romantic town.

45:15.400 --> 45:19.029
You know? It's the kind of place where
you just take somebody that you love,

45:19.160 --> 45:24.188
and just sit back, relax,
throw on the jazz, and just chill.

45:25.200 --> 45:27.156
You know?

45:31.320 --> 45:35.279
That's something you can do when
Jacqueline gets to town, you know.

45:35.920 --> 45:38.514
- Now, where'd that come from?
- I don't know.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.756
Where did that come from?
Who said that?

45:40.880 --> 45:45.431
I think you said it. It sounded like it
came out of your mouth, from nowhere.

45:45.720 --> 45:48.632
I just, you know, I think you're cool.

45:48.760 --> 45:52.150
I like you, and
I was just being concerned.

45:52.280 --> 45:55.033
- All up in my business.
- I wasn't tryin' to pry, really.

45:55.160 --> 45:58.232
- Do I look like the kinda girl to pry?
- Not five minutes ago,

45:58.360 --> 46:01.591
but now you look like the one.
If you looked up "pry" in the dictionary,

46:01.720 --> 46:04.393
there'd be your picture next to it, like...

46:31.960 --> 46:34.315
Look who's cookin' now.

46:46.680 --> 46:48.636
Marcus.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.434
- What's the matter with you?
- Stop it.

46:57.560 --> 47:00.120
- What?
- Stop.

47:00.240 --> 47:03.596
OK, OK. Stop it, Marcus.
I think that we should go home.

47:03.720 --> 47:05.836
Let's go home.

47:08.360 --> 47:10.828
Well, that was pretty great, huh?

47:10.960 --> 47:13.235
Yeah, pretty great.

47:23.600 --> 47:25.750
Well, you enjoy that mint.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.713
I hope it's refreshing, and chocolaty.

47:35.680 --> 47:37.636
My key won't work.

47:40.880 --> 47:42.836
Shit.

47:44.200 --> 47:48.273
Hey, Marcus.
Why don't you come here for a second?

47:48.400 --> 47:52.154
I'm not playin'. My key really
is not working. You know?

47:53.320 --> 47:54.878
Please?

49:51.600 --> 49:53.158
Yes.

49:53.760 --> 49:55.318
Yes.

50:12.520 --> 50:15.717
- She even has pretty feet.
- Oh, yeah? How's the coochie?

50:15.840 --> 50:18.559
- Man, that is crass.
- May I help you?

50:18.680 --> 50:21.274
No, we're OK, we're just browsin'.

50:25.080 --> 50:27.548
- He's trippin'.
- Look, I'm a realist, right?

50:27.680 --> 50:30.558
If the coochie's good,
everything else falls into place.

50:30.680 --> 50:35.390
It's more than sex with this girl. I dig
her - her spirit, her mind, everything.

50:35.520 --> 50:40.355
You know, she could be Mrs Graham.
You think I'm jokin'. She's that bad.

50:40.480 --> 50:42.550
Marcus is in love.

50:42.680 --> 50:45.478
Yo. Yo, I'm gettin' this, Marcus. Step off.

50:45.600 --> 50:48.319
That jacket is $1800.

50:48.440 --> 50:50.032
No refunds.

50:50.160 --> 50:54.392
- What, you think I can't pay for it?
- Well, there is no layaway plan.

50:55.200 --> 50:57.430
We're OK. We don't need any help.

50:57.560 --> 50:59.915
We don't keep cash in the store.

51:04.120 --> 51:06.031
- He's a sucker, man.
- Racial.

51:06.160 --> 51:08.879
- You right, man. Don't even trip on it.
- No refund?

51:09.000 --> 51:12.595
What's he think, you're gonna wear it,
stink it all up to be damned,

51:12.720 --> 51:15.757
- and, like, give it back to him?
- We can't get over this...

51:15.880 --> 51:19.031
There are certain people
with a natural fear of black people.

51:19.160 --> 51:21.037
They're programmed. Watch. Now!

51:21.160 --> 51:24.118
See how frightened he was, just from
a black man screaming "now"?

51:24.240 --> 51:26.913
He thought it was the end of the world.

51:27.960 --> 51:30.872
- What do you think?
- People are gonna love this.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.878
I think that this is gonna
be great for her image.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.630
- Well, look at this one.
- Angela. Wow.

51:38.760 --> 51:41.479
- You like it? Really?
- Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.591
Great. Thank you. Guess what?

51:43.720 --> 51:46.553
Marcus thinks we ought to go
to the Caribbean to shoot this.

51:46.680 --> 51:48.557
The Caribbean?

51:48.680 --> 51:50.272
That's expensive.

51:50.400 --> 51:53.233
- I know.
- But it's nice. No, it's a nice idea.

51:53.360 --> 51:56.591
- You know Marcus and his big ideas.
- I do.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.639
You know, speaking of Marcus...

51:59.760 --> 52:03.116
I hear he's got a real reputation.

52:04.480 --> 52:06.311
Bony T told you that, right?

52:09.320 --> 52:11.470
Well, Angela,

52:12.520 --> 52:16.069
I can confirm that Marcus's reputation

52:16.200 --> 52:19.397
is extremely well-deserved.

52:19.840 --> 52:23.230
You can confirm it?
Like, you and Marcus have...?

52:23.640 --> 52:29.670
God, this man, he's wonderful.
I mean, he's kind of... he's magnificent.

52:30.080 --> 52:33.436
And he just happens to have
the best ass I have ever seen.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.715
- Hey, babe, you got a sec?
- Marcus, hi.

52:36.840 --> 52:37.955
- Hi.
- Oh, God.

52:40.400 --> 52:43.358
What did I walk in on?
What are y'all talkin' about?

52:43.480 --> 52:45.596
- God, we're talking about work.
- Work.

52:45.720 --> 52:48.314
No, no, no.
You're both blushing. What's up?

52:48.440 --> 52:49.589
Art. Art.

52:49.720 --> 52:52.712
No, there's a girlishness happening.
What's up? Talk to me.

52:52.840 --> 52:55.195
- Some girliness. Girliness.
- Nothing.

52:55.320 --> 52:57.151
- Why you leavin'?
- It's time to go.

52:57.280 --> 52:59.271
- Gerard hit it, didn't he?
- No. Hit it?

52:59.400 --> 53:03.951
- Gerard could not hit it if he had a bat.
- You want to keep it a secret, huh?

53:04.080 --> 53:07.231
- But he hit it. It's Gerard, isn't it?
- I don't know.

53:07.360 --> 53:11.911
I came here to tell you what
a wonderful time I had in New Orleans...

53:12.040 --> 53:15.715
Marcus, hon, I don't think that
we should do this in the office.

53:15.840 --> 53:18.308
- What?
- I really gotta stop.

53:18.440 --> 53:22.274
Get on top of the desk
and get frisky and go crazy.

53:24.160 --> 53:25.434
Listen.

53:27.600 --> 53:33.311
- You're not gettin' serious, are you?
- What you talkin' about? What is that?

53:33.440 --> 53:36.796
Well, you know.
Where you want this to...

53:36.920 --> 53:40.469
to grow into a relationship where...

53:40.600 --> 53:43.637
God, we're together all the time,
stuff like that.

53:43.760 --> 53:45.716
- Are you?
- Excuse me.

53:46.760 --> 53:50.878
I-I know that you're not tellin'
me that New Orleans was a fling.

53:51.600 --> 53:54.398
No. No, no.

53:54.520 --> 53:59.435
I had a great time in New Orleans. You
know I had a great time in New Orleans.

53:59.560 --> 54:02.996
- So what's the problem?
- Well, I just think that...

54:03.760 --> 54:07.833
New Orleans was New Orleans,
and we should leave it at that.

54:11.880 --> 54:14.394
I'm not tryin' to
pressure you or anything.

54:14.520 --> 54:18.308
- No. No. No, no, no.
- I'm not proposing or anything.

54:18.440 --> 54:21.796
- Of course not.
- My tuxedo isn't ironed or nothin'.

54:22.680 --> 54:26.309
- I believe in takin' things slow, too.
- That's what I'm talking about.

54:27.160 --> 54:31.676
I was just wonderin' when we could
see each other again, that's all.

54:32.800 --> 54:35.109
I don't know. I'm kinda busy right now.

54:35.240 --> 54:39.836
I just found out that I'm gonna have to
be spending a lot of time outta town,

54:39.960 --> 54:43.077
so, I'll get back to you, OK?

54:44.360 --> 54:46.476
You'll get back to me?

54:46.600 --> 54:51.879
I don't have my schedule, my
secretary's outta town, so I'll call you.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.595
"Marcus, with regards to us
doing it again, I'll get back to you."

54:55.720 --> 54:58.598
That's a new one on Marcus.

54:58.720 --> 55:02.554
Just don't make me wait too long,
cos it's not like I gotta sit by the phone

55:02.680 --> 55:04.910
and wait for somebody
to get back to me.

55:05.040 --> 55:09.397
No. No, I realise that you of all people
will not be waiting alone,

55:09.520 --> 55:12.273
so I will try and get back to you soon.

55:16.280 --> 55:17.633
You gonna call?

55:44.000 --> 55:45.035
Hello? Yes? Yes?

55:45.160 --> 55:46.115
- Hello?
- Yes?

55:46.240 --> 55:47.798
- Mr Graham?
- Yes.

55:47.920 --> 55:51.151
Miss Broyer asked me to tell you
she is free the evening of the 12th.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.116
The 12th is three weeks from now.

55:57.240 --> 55:59.879
Sorry. That's her first opening.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.150
Should I pencil you in?

56:07.120 --> 56:08.473
Yeah.

56:09.440 --> 56:11.590
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

56:17.680 --> 56:20.194
Marcus.

56:33.480 --> 56:36.119
Yo, brother, man.
Gold watches, gold chains.

56:36.240 --> 56:38.674
Yo, you gotta show
some gold to get that girl.

56:38.800 --> 56:41.234
I already have a watch.
But thank you. Gucci.

56:41.360 --> 56:43.715
- Brother, that's a nice watch.
- Thank you.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.796
Watch your back.

56:50.120 --> 56:52.953
Can you tell me
what time the show starts?

56:54.280 --> 56:58.432
- Course I am.
- I wanna know when the show starts.

56:58.560 --> 57:01.836
Hold on for a second. What?

57:01.960 --> 57:03.951
What time does the show start?

57:04.080 --> 57:06.196
The show started a half an hour ago.

57:06.320 --> 57:08.072
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

57:08.200 --> 57:11.158
- You're very good at this job.
- I know this.

57:12.120 --> 57:13.189
Some punk-ass nigger.

57:13.520 --> 57:17.069
Yeah, hi. What time did
Flight 97 from Toronto get in?

57:17.960 --> 57:21.475
Three hours ago? OK, was there
a Jacqueline Broyer on the plane?

57:22.600 --> 57:25.797
You can't give that information?
This is Flight Information, right?

57:25.920 --> 57:30.232
Then why do you call it Flight...?
Forget it. Forget it. Thank you.

57:32.640 --> 57:37.191
Can you see if there've been any
accidents between JFK and midtown?

57:37.320 --> 57:39.788
Well, what the hell is 911 for?

57:39.920 --> 57:41.990
Well, I wanna talk to a supervi...

57:47.440 --> 57:50.159
- Hello.
- You finally decide to show up.

57:50.600 --> 57:54.149
I had some meetings that ran over,
so I had to take a later flight.

57:59.080 --> 58:02.231
And you can't pick up a telephone
and call somebody, right?

58:02.360 --> 58:05.875
I would've called, but they didn't
have a phone on the plane.

58:07.080 --> 58:11.471
I wasted $200 on tickets. Just wasted.
And it's all your fault, OK?

58:12.320 --> 58:15.198
I'm sorry. Why don't I give you
the money for the tickets?

58:15.320 --> 58:19.632
It has nothing to do with the money.
You're bein' inconsiderate.

58:19.760 --> 58:23.230
I was callin' all over New York. You
could've been on a road somewhere.

58:23.360 --> 58:26.318
That's very sweet.
That's very, very sweet.

58:29.400 --> 58:32.119
One of my tricks, OK?
I know the flower thing.

58:33.400 --> 58:38.190
Listen, I'm upset with you. What you did
was inconsiderate, and I'm upset.

58:38.320 --> 58:41.756
Well, maybe I should just go.

58:43.560 --> 58:44.913
Yeah.

58:45.720 --> 58:47.836
I'll go.

58:47.960 --> 58:50.110
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

58:54.880 --> 58:56.313
Listen...

58:56.440 --> 59:00.319
Look, I had a long day.
You had a long day.

59:00.440 --> 59:04.069
I'm trippin', I'm buggin' out,
and maybe I'm goin' a little overboard.

59:04.200 --> 59:09.149
You dry off. Let's put this whole thing
behind us and just squash this thing.

59:11.080 --> 59:13.275
So, does this mean
that you forgive me?

59:13.400 --> 59:17.075
This means I'm being a bit emotional,
and I acknowledge that,

59:17.200 --> 59:19.475
and we should just squash it.

59:20.240 --> 59:24.358
Well, I think it means you forgive me.

59:30.760 --> 59:33.718
- You have no clothes on underneath.
- No.

59:38.920 --> 59:40.956
You're too much.

59:41.080 --> 59:44.152
You knew you was wrong, that's why
you came over in your drawers.

59:44.280 --> 59:46.840
Cos you knew that it wasn't right.

59:56.520 --> 59:58.750
- It's Jacqueline's.
- Say it.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.438
Jacqueline.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.796
- Whose is it, huh? Whose is it?
- It's yours. It's yours.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.788
Wait, wait, wait,
I don't wanna come yet.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.559
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.678
Oh, yeah.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.313
Oh, yes.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.228
No, wait, wait, don't do nothin'.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.196
No... Don't you say nothin'.
Don't say nothin'. No, don't touch me.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:44.189
Don't touch me. Don't move.
Don't do nothin'. Just hold still. Hold...

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.551
No, no. Don't, don't. Oh, no. Shit.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.832
You knew I was coming.
You knew I was. You knew I was.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.956
I have to call my mother.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.549
Where you goin'?

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:19.834
Home. I have to give a speech
in the morning to the board of directors.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:22.349
But thank you. You were great.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:28.592
God, Marcus, I was so tense when I got
off the plane, but you really relaxed me.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.114
So, Mr Graham, thank you.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.198
You really have to go?

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:40.949
But I'll call you
sometime tomorrow, OK?

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.036
Get some sleep.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.556
Call me.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:34.197
- Would anyone care for some dessert?
- Yeah, I'll have the tiramisu.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.836
- I just want some coffee.
- And for the lady?

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.951
I am on a diet.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.389
- v ery good.
- Diet? Diet, schmiet.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.672
Are you crazy? You look great. I can't
wait to get you down to the Caribbean.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.950
I'm not sure I'm going anywhere.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:54.915
You've gotta go. Marcus has planned
a wonderful trip. We're gonna have fun.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.235
Yeah. I'm gonna make a phone call.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.033
- Go make a phone call.
- Excuse me. Yeah.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.472
I know you were concerned about
how the layout was gonna be,

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.398
but I'm picturin' you
and beautiful white beaches,

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.353
and powder-blue skies,
crystal beautiful water.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:13.199
You stand in the middle of it,
lookin' breathtakin'.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.629
So, when are we gonna fuck?

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.631
- What?
- According to Jacqueline,

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.228
you are really great in bed.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.872
Jacqueline told you
I was really good in bed?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.434
Well, according to Jacqueline,

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.155
you really know how to
move your ass, you know?

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:36.234
She told you I know how to
move my ass in bed? OK.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:40.319
OK, well, I don't know what Miss...
what Jacqueline has told you,

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:44.558
but it's not that kinda party,
and I'd appreciate it if... Stop that.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.754
Stop. Stop it. Will you stop it?

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:51.156
<i>Merde, alors. Man, I don't believe this.</i>

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.751
You are going to turn down
a pussy like this?

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.673
Staring you smack in your face?
No man can turn down this pussy.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:04.190
- Will you stop it?
- I don't know any man that can refuse.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.550
Stop saying pussy, people are eating.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.557
Pussy. Pussy.

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.910
Pussy. Pussy.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.875
Pussy. Puss, puss, pussy.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.109
Tryin' to find our cat. Where is that cat?

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.636
- What's the matter with you?
- You don't like women?

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:29.396
Yes, that's it.
I don't like women. I mean, I'm gay.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.399
You're not gay. You're not gay,
you just don't wanna fuck me.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.590
I know a gay man. I know what
a gay guy looks like. My brother is gay.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.676
And you. You. He's gay.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.551
And he is gay.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.150
- OK, what did you say to her?
- What did I say?

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.840
I heard this woman
screaming from the bathroom.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:05.748
How dare you discuss what I do with
you in bed sexually with that woman?

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.872
As soon as you leave,
she starts sayin' she wants to fuck me.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.389
- How could you talk about what I do?
- She said that?

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.272
- You said it...
- She's a little off.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:16.233
She starts talkin' about
how my ass moves. I know you said it.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.828
Don't expect me
to sleep with people for business.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:22.157
- You did with Lady Eloise.
- Excuse me, that is a rumour.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.511
We do not know if I slept with
Lady Eloise. I had a chitchat with her.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.790
- Please, Marcus.
- Please, my ass.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.593
Don't discuss what I do with you
with other people.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.556
I'll handle this.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.390
OK, Strangé, what's the problem?

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.469
- I'm not going.
- Now, listen.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.478
You're gonna
have yourself on the plane,

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.672
or I will not only take back
the million-two I am paying you,

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:06.555
I will sue you for every goddamn dime
you've got. Do you understand that?

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.713
What an absolutely
exhausting evening, huh?

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.755
To tell you the truth, Marcus,
I don't feel very well.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.556
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.911
You've made me feel dirty.
I don't believe this is happenin' to me.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.315
Look at you. God, Marcus,

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:37.955
you're gettin' yourself all upset
and worked up over nothing.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.196
Nothin'? That's what sex is to you.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.034
Whatever happened to
caring and commitment?

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.197
Some people still think
things like that are important.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:50.632
You've made it painfully obvious
that you're not one of them people.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:55.880
Well, why don't I give you a second
to think about it, hm?

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.276
Really?

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:04.389
Yeah. I think you should, you know,
do your own thing.

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.956
OK, Marcus.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.036
It's over.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.716
Good night.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.910
Good night.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:55.432
Marcus. Marcus. I don't believe the way
you let her dog you out like that.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.518
You're walkin' around
with your head down, mopin'.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.518
Where's your pride?
Where's your dignity?

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.996
You think Malcolm X died so you could
walk around lookin' like a chump?

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.839
Bony, not today, OK?

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.436
Sad, man.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:16.831
First the Fat Boys break up, now this.
There's nothin' to believe in.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.796
Good morning, Marcus.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.196
Morning.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.358
- Morning.
- Good morning.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.310
Good morning, Marcus Graham.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.518
Morning.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.997
Marcus? Excuse me.

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:17.956
I need the storyboards for the Strangé
spots. I'm shooting next week.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:25.149
- Shoot whatever you wanna shoot.
- Whatever I want to shoot?

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:27.316
It's your show.

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:31.115
- I have complete autonomy?
- You the man.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.234
Thank you. Bless you. Bye.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.590
Excuse me. Jacqueline,
can I talk to you for just a second?

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.837
- Yeah, sure.
- I know it's none of my business,

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:49.715
what's going on with you and Marcus,
but can you try to take it easy on him?

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.638
Please?

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.276
Excuse me?

01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.149
Well, whatever it is you're doing to him,
it's starting to affect his work.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:03.272
What I am doing to him?

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.758
Yeah.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:16.074
Well, it seems like whatever it is
I'm doing to him,

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.953
you are taking rather personally.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.789
- Am I mistaken? Huh?
- No, Jackie.

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:26.789
I'm just saying, it's just
affecting his work, that's all.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.275
Well, we don't wanna do that.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.076
Thanks, Jack.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.870
We have something exciting coming up.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.312
After months of hard work by our
creative team, you are about to see

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.399
the commercial that will launch
our $18 million push

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:50.592
for the new Strangé fragrance.

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.676
Lights, please.

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.713
- How is it?
- I haven't seen it. I let Nelson do it.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.789
This is my vision. It is fabulous.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.878
Fabulous.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.599
Strangé.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.995
It stinks so good.

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.839
That is ridiculous.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.915
Well, the board
wanted me to let you go.

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:28.029
I convinced them
to give you another chance.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.709
Well, as an employee, I thank you
for saving my job, and as your lover,

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.231
- I thank you for ruining my life.
- Come on, I didn't ruin your life.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.920
You ruined your life.
I said this was gonna happen.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.998
I was just hoping
it didn't happen with you.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:47.798
The only thing that I can suggest is...

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:52.473
perhaps you should
take a few weeks off.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.278
OK.

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.639
There's this one kid that you are gonna
love. He is so cute. It'll really lift you up.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:36.118
Marcus. I am not gonna let you sit and
mope all day long. Now snap out of it.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:39.391
Have you been listenin' to me?
Cupid has his foot in my ass.

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.750
I have the cure for Cupid, all right?

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:46.635
Now, when I have problems with my
relationships, which is most of the time,

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:52.596
I find out that it's better to take the
focus off myself and put it to others.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.995
I don't wanna be around no kids.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:00.069
I wanna go home and sit in my house
and look at the wall and listen to Sade.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.839
- And that's fun?
- No, but that's where my head is at.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:07.476
That's where I need to be. I don't wanna
paint. You can't paint my misery away.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.391
- Hi.
- Hi, Angela.

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.512
Thank you.
Everybody, this is Mr Graham.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.477
Who did that?

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:22.991
These are kids I teach art to whose
schools can't afford an art programme.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.351
- That's so nice.
- Now, remember last week we saw...

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.517
- I'm gonna whup somebody's ass.
- Sit down, Marcus.

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:32.950
Remember last week we looked at
collages from Romare Bearden?

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:36.117
- Yes.
- And what were you supposed to do?

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.595
Bring your own collages.

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:41.234
OK, who wants to show me theirs first?

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.348
Oh, boy. Kenny.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.557
<i>Assalam alaikum, my brother.</i>

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:53.036
- Greetings, my Nubian princess.
- My king.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.879
This is the sun,
and these are the sunrays,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.798
and this is a big, giant,
huge hole in the ozone layer,

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:04.074
and this is what'll happen to people if
we don't fix up the ozone layer quickly.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.395
That's very Afrocentric.
I like this, Khanya.

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:11.230
- What a lively little thing you are.
- OK, tell us about this.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.791
This is my house. This is the sun.

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.799
This is a spear, and this is a shield.

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.876
Then we have...

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.116
That, right here,
is my fish bowl, and this is blood.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:30.313
Then these are my clothes,
and these are the fish.

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:33.193
Yeah, why...?
This is the fish bowl up here, right?

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:37.518
And these are the fish, and this is the
floor. Why aren't the fish in the bowl?

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:41.315
- Because I don't want them there.
- But they can't live on the floor.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.797
Art can be very abstract. It doesn't have
to make sense. Only in the artist's mind.

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.196
- Thank you, Khanya.
- Thank you for your interpretation.

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.436
OK, who's gonna be next?

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.431
You cannot tell me you did not
have fun in there with those kids.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.916
I ain't sayin' it wasn't fun,
I just wasn't in the right mind-set.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.953
Mind-set? You didn't think about
Jacqueline once in there.

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:04.910
True.

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:08.316
I bet you didn't think about
the Strangé commercial either. Right?

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:12.718
Yeah, you're right. The kids are a little
more inspirational than I've been lately.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.796
Thank you.

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.152
- I got an idea.
- What?

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.670
I got an idea for the Strangé ad.

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.035
OK. Slow it down.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.909
Right there.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.751
OK. What do you think?

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.950
Well, I like it.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.550
Hold it. Is that a nipple?

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.392
- That's not a nipple. That's a shadow.
- That's a nipple.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:52.269
- Excuse me, that is a shadow.
- I think it's a shadow of a nipple.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.437
Come on. Stop playing. That's a nipple.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.710
- It's a shadow.
- I'll blow it up.

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.793
It's a nipple, cos I'm droolin'.

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:11.030
You a little nervous
about meeting Gerard's parents?

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:16.440
No, I'm not. I just don't want them
to think we're a couple, you know.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.553
Don't even trip. Gerard ain't even
that close to his father, first of all.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:24.468
You know, I knew it.
Gerard is really a fun guy, isn't he?

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.273
- He's very much fun.
- It's his father and his mother

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.391
that are the square ones.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.796
- Right?
- I got it.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.436
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.469
- Hey, what's up?
- Angela's over there.

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.751
How you doin', Mr Jackson?
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:48.069
- You look great.
- Thank you. So do you.

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:51.033
Thanks. My parents are here.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:55.308
- You look just like your dad.
- Thanks.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:59.228
- I brought you some chitterlings.
- Gerard's mother...

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.148
Angela, Gerard's mother brought us
a whole trough of chitterlings.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.236
- I'll take the chitterlings.
- I want a bowl.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.830
This the little girl you been
talkin' about? Agatha?

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.470
Angela. Angela Lewis.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.238
- That's what I said.
- Nice to meet you.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:16.955
Isn't she pretty?
She looks like one of Marcus' girls.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:24.271
Agatha, go in the kitchen and help
Mrs Jackson with these chitterlings.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.118
Cutie pie.

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.391
I have to talk to Mr Jackson.
Mr Jackson, come here.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.478
So good to see you.
Every year, you do something new.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:36.195
- Where'd you get the mushroom shirt?
- I'm trying to impress you.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.311
I know. Now, where'd you get the shirt?

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:42.194
The secret is you got to coordinate.
Most people don't coordinate.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:45.039
- See, you got to coordinate.
- That's what you did.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.549
- Interesting.
- See? I told you they don't stink

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.955
- when you pull the membrane out.
- Momma.

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:53.390
- You saw me, saw the mushroom shirt.
- I said "mushroom shirt".

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.829
See, you can't stop
with the mushroom shirt.

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:58.155
- I would've stopped.
- You gotta keep goin'.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.955
- Now, let me show you somethin'.
- You got on a mushroom belt.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.356
Gerard, did you know your pops
had a mushroom belt on?

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:08.153
- Yes.
- But you don't stop there, see?

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:10.714
- You gotta keep goin'.
- What you got, a mushroom ring?

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:13.638
That's a good idea. Look what I got.

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.396
Gerard.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:18.519
Did you know on the inside
was special mushrooms?

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.595
Yes.

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.031
Simply delicious, Marcus.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:29.111
I tell Yvonne she should take cookin'
lessons from you. All she cook is pork.

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:33.313
I'll bet we've eaten everything
on the pig from the rooter to the tooter.

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:37.634
- The whole pig, huh?
- You didn't marry me for my cookin'.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.318
You got that right, baby.
That's why we got junior.

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:44.909
Daddy, please.

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:48.510
Must you embarrass me in front
of my friends on every occasion?

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:54.437
Now, see? That's your son. Private
school got him all saddity like that.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.755
Yeah, man, chill. That's your father.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:01.396
Mr Jackson, Angela made this meal.
I can't take credit for it. It was Angela.

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.909
- v ery good.
- v ery good.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.235
- Good pick, junior.
- Daddy.

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:09.318
I told you that Angela and I
are just friends.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.150
- Just friends, huh?
- Yes.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.396
- Just friends.
- Leave it alone, hon.

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.750
They told you that 500 times.
Just let it go.

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:23.996
Fine. We'll change the subject.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.509
Now, Marcus, I hear a girl
at the office got you pussy-whipped.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.999
Why don't you reverse it?

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.715
Don't be pussy-whipped.
Whip that pussy. Look.

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:42.154
Daddy, please.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.955
If you really insist on standin' around,
I don't dig the long face.

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:51.232
Man, my parents been in that bathroom
damn near an hour, man.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.511
- So what?
- Well, they been in there hittin' it.

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:01.996
- Your parents are smokin' a joint?
- No, they been in there fuckin'.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:09.233
Damn. Goodness.
What's for dessert? Wow.

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:46.157
I'm all right, man.
Let's go. Let's go eat, man.

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:55.271
- You don't want me to go with you?
- No, I'd better run them home

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:58.392
- before they embarrass me any further.
- OK.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:01.398
I had a great time. I'll call you tomorrow.

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:06.036
Mrs Jackson. I cannot tell y'all
how much fun it is to be with y'all.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.720
- So good.
- A piece of coat, I think.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:13.231
Oh, boy. The rabbit is gettin' old, baby.
Look at that.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:17.273
We could tear another piece off
and make some earrings. Coordinate.

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.358
- Yo, yo. Yo, got a hook-up for tonight.
- Who?

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:25.235
Remember that little girl I met in
Emergency? Baby got her stitches out.

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.992
- Well, whatever. I'll rap to you.
- All right. I gotta go.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:33.557
- OK, bye, Tyler. Take care of yourself.
- See y'all later, all right?

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.477
- Later.
- Bye.

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.672
- You don't want me to help?
- I got it. Go on home.

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.358
OK.

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:43.636
Where's my coat?

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:50.958
Angela.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.954
Yes?

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.640
I'm gonna have to
take you up on that offer.

01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:00.320
- I thought so.
- Yes.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:05.195
Chitterling juice everywhere,
and I don't know if I can handle it alone.

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:15.034
I'm so tired. I don't care if I never see
another cup or plate again in my life.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.638
- My feet. Can I take my shoes off?
- Yeah, you can.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.070
You'll have the whole house
smellin' like funky corn chips.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:25.636
<i>- Please, my feet do not stink.
- Star Trek's comin' on.</i>

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.478
<i>- I love Star Trek.
- Do you really?</i>

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:30.592
- Yeah, I'm a Trekkie.
- Get outta here. I'm a Trekkie.

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:35.430
Ain't Captain Kirk the coolest
white man on the planet?

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:40.634
You can always tell who's gonna get
killed. Now, look who's beamin' down.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:44.309
You see Kirk, McCoy, Spock,
and Yeoman Johnson.

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.829
Doesn't Yeoman Johnson know
he's gonna get killed?

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:51.715
If I was Yeoman Johnson, I'd say "I'm
not goin'. I know what's gonna happen".

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:59.272
<i>It's amazing how you've just broken
down this whole Star Trek thing.</i>

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:03.552
I'm a Trekkie, that's why. I broke it
down to the barest essence of the Trek.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:06.319
<i>I'm a Trekkie.
I know everything about Star Trek.</i>

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.557
- What's Captain Kirk's first name?
- Captain.

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.796
No, it's not Captain.

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.070
His name is James T Kirk.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.715
What's Mr Spock's last name?

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:25.032
You didn't even know that.
Name is Spock Jenkins.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:27.913
One of the Jenkins boys from vulcan.

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.955
We'll talk about it later.

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.873
What are we doin'?

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.956
We're kissing.

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.635
We ain't supposed to be kissing.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.273
- Why?
- Cos we're friends.

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:47.679
So?

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.756
Friends can kiss.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.957
Do something
CRAZY

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.755
It's good. It's very good.

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:47.190
- Congratulations, Marcus.
- Congratulate Angela.

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.470
It was mostly her idea.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.635
Nice going, Angela.

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.598
Thanks.

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.198
Hey, you.

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.389
Yo, man. It's racial.

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.590
- Well, expand.
- All right, check it out.

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.838
The white ball dominates everything.
Knocks the shit out of the yellow ball,

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:13.271
the red ball, right? And the game's over

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:18.349
when the white ball drives
the black ball completely off the table.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.718
Now why is that?

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:25.071
I don't know, but I'm sure
you'll tell me, my brother.

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:29.077
Sure you right. Look...

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:32.909
It's because of the white man's fear

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.352
of the sexual potency of black balls.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:43.799
Now, that one was kinda interesting.
I see where you're goin'.

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.993
- The pool table is earth, so it's green.
- See, your shit is comin' out now.

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.953
And the world,
they used to think it was flat.

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.035
School him.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.276
When you do Oprah,
I wanna be front row.

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.756
It's not about jokes.
Me and him are here.

01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.509
That one was kinda deep. You went to
the bottom of the ocean on that one.

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:02.835
- Losers get the beer.
- I'm gonna get the beer...

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:06.111
- But see how our thing is here?
- We are on the same wavelength.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:08.390
- We're the same cat.
- Get him, then.

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.830
- I'll get him. I'm gonna work on him.
- Fine.

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.797
Yo, man, he's gettin' worse.
We got to find him a woman, quick.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.911
He's gonna be all right.

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:21.112
Hey, how are things
with you and Angela?

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.348
We're cool, man. You know.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.358
We went out a couple times,
and she was gettin' so involved.

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:30.790
And I said "Look,
I'm just gonna pull back."

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.114
Cool.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.437
Yeah. You know, I told her
"Look here, girl, do your thing."

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:38.950
"See other men, cos I'm gonna
see other women, you know."

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:43.278
I just didn't wanna break her heart
right off. You know, I just pull out easy.

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.714
Good. You don't mind if
she goes out with other guys?

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.796
Hell, no.

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.916
You thinkin' of
hookin' her up with Tyler?

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:57.873
- No, nothin' like that.
- Why you askin', man?

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.956
I was just curious.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.710
I don't believe this shit.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.396
Why you askin', man?

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:32.191
You can't even look me in my eye,
can you, Marcus?

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:44.830
Did you sleep with Angela?

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.636
Yeah, I did.

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:57.235
Why do you always have
to have all the girls, Marcus?

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.510
You said you didn't care
who she went out with.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:02.074
Now you're flippin'.
You're bein' a hypocrite.

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.668
I don't wanna hear that bullshit, man.

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:07.678
This is different. Angela is a nice girl.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.188
- So I can't be with a nice girl?
- No.

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:16.711
Cos all you gonna do is dog her out,
like you do every woman in your life.

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:20.310
OK, tell me this, man. Why Angela?
What, she has nice feet?

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:23.318
It has nothin' to do with her feet.
I care about this girl.

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:26.796
Man, you don't care about
nobody but yourself, man.

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:38.919
So, when we can rise as a people,
we runnin' things, you know?

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:45.238
- What'd you do, man?
- Guess.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:54.434
Marcus. Come quick.
I got somethin' I wanna show you.

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.710
- What?
- I wanna show you something.

01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:00.071
- Get outta here. I'm in the shower.
- Marcus.

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.156
Stop.

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:05.636
Come on, I'm soakin' wet. You
gonna make me catch a cold out here.

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:10.880
No, I won't. Look.
Well? What do you think?

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:14.791
- Blue people. Yeah, that's nice.
- What do you think?

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:16.638
- Do you like it?
- Yes, very much.

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:20.514
OK, OK, OK. Look at it and
tell me how it makes you feel.

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:23.677
- Honestly, it's makin' me kinda horny.
- No. Feel.

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:26.917
- I'd like to think I was the inspiration.
- No. Look.

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:30.077
- I think you should be blue.
- No. You'll get paint all over me.

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.270
- The phone's ringing.
- I'll get paint on you.

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:36.393
Take your clothes off.
Take 'em off. Off. Clothes...

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.476
No. Hello?

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.395
Jacqueline. Hi.

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:43.351
How you doin'?

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:47.155
He's right here, actually.
No. No, we weren't busy at all.

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.840
Here he is. OK.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.796
Hey. Yeah.

01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:00.719
No, that was Angela.
She just stopped by for a second.

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:06.198
Really? That's...

01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:09.270
Your spot tested through the roof.

01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.600
Yeah. Yeah, she's happy.

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:16.394
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:18.397
That's perfect. Great.

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.431
Yeah. Peace.

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.757
They're showin' the spot
to the board of directors on Friday,

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:26.075
and Jacqueline wants me to be there.

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:28.156
Great.

01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.876
Wait. You don't have
a problem with that?

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.719
- No.
- I will call her and tell her that...

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.796
You sure?

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.516
Cool. That's bad.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.956
Blue people.

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.272
Peace. Chill.

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:12.957
You are brilliant. God, Marcus,
they loved it. They loved it.

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:15.150
<i>Did you hear him
screamin' "magnifique"</i>

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:19.592
with a bead of sweat runnin' down his
face, man? I knew I had that cat.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:22.837
Marcus, you are incredibly talented.

01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:27.998
Well, I thank you.
Lady Eloise thanks you.

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:29.315
Tell her I said hey.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:33.149
I'm sure Strangé would like
to thank you personally.

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:36.552
Yeah, she'd like
to thank the hell outta me.

01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:46.394
I have to say, it's very nice
to have the old Marcus back.

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:49.349
- I was kinda worried about you.
- Really?

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.636
You seemed...

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.958
You seemed so... I don't know.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:58.471
- Can I be honest?
- Please.

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:03.276
Well, you seemed desperate,
and unsure of yourself.

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.039
- Pathetic?
- Kind of.

01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.952
But look at you now. You're...

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.355
You're relaxed.

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:17.471
You're more confident.

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:20.558
Just like the man
I met in that elevator.

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:24.995
- I got it goin' on again?
- Yeah. I like it.

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.315
I find it very attractive.

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:31.593
How'd it go last night?

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.476
It went OK.

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.230
Just OK?

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:44.309
Must've gone pretty well. You didn't
get home until the middle of the night.

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:52.156
I went for a walk so I could sort
some things out that was in my head.

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.794
I was trippin' on it.

01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.388
Like the fact that
you still love Jacqueline?

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.393
Angela, I saw the woman,

01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:03.910
and a bunch of stuff in me
I didn't know was still there came out.

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:10.388
Things happened and... There's certain
things you just have no control over.

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.829
Really? Like what?

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:15.913
Like love.

01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:17.758
Love?

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:21.190
You know,
what do you know about love?

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:24.473
What do you possibly think
you know about love?

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:28.878
I'm sick and tired of men using love
like it's a kind of disease you just catch.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.390
Love should have brought
your ass home last night.

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:36.119
- Didn't you hear me say I was sorry?
- I heard you.

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:39.391
You're sorry and you're tired.
You don't love me or Jacqueline.

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:42.114
You only love your damn self.

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:44.310
How could you say
I never cared about you?

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:48.956
Jacqueline says that I'm a better person
now, and I owe that all to you.

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.196
I'm outta here.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.958
I'll get the rest of my things later.

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.109
Let me just tell you one more thing.
I might not be all glamorous,

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:07.836
and I don't have hair down my back, but
let me tell you one great thing about me.

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:11.714
I've got a heart. You know the bad
thing about having a heart, Marcus?

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:14.991
It's that it gets broken
when you deal with people like you.

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:17.714
Now stay the fuck outta my life.

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:33.640
She left you, huh?

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.832
Yeah. She did.

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.713
I guess I should feel happy, but I don't.

01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:49.593
I hate to see another person in pain.

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:55.116
Thank you very much. That's very nice
of you, Yvonne. Good night.

01:37:55.240 --> 01:38:00.030
So, would you like to come over
for a cup of coffee?

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:04.558
Not even if Jesus was pourin' it.

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:09.030
Some motherfuckers can't see
a good thing when it's starin' at them.

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:13.312
Why don't you just leap your black ass
off the ledge, then? Fuck you.

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.956
- I can't do this.
- I have condoms.

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.878
No, it's not that. I gotta go.

01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:51.478
What?

01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:59.198
I'm in love with somebody.

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.070
Angela, right?

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:04.350
So now you think
you're in love with Angela.

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.072
No. No, no.

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:10.239
I know - just at this moment,
I know I'm in love with that woman.

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:18.514
Marcus, if you are in love with Angela,
why are you here with me?

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:26.476
Exactly.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.877
Oh, shit. Dammit.

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:04.190
Hold up.

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.719
- Yo, whassup?
- Whassup?

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:13.558
Come on in.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.276
- Welcome to the penthouse.
- It's kinda smoky in here, chief.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:19.550
No, no. Wait. That ain't smoke, all right?

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:22.478
That's aroma.

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.878
Yo, can you get that for me?
Think that might be a little surprise.

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:40.878
Whassup, man? Where you goin'?

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.676
Yo, man. Talk.

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:58.198
Whassup, man?

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.914
Hey, how you doin'?

01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:09.913
So have you seen Angela lately?

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:14.718
No, I hear she's over
at Barton and Dobbs now.

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:20.673
Yeah, I heard she got
promoted to creative director.

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:23.394
Really? Where'd you hear that?

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.116
Bony T told me.

01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:35.392
Look, man.

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:39.115
- You don't have to say anything.
- I do. I'm really sorry, Gerard.

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:43.756
I've known you all my life, man. You're
like my brother, you know, and I...

01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:47.634
I love you and I...
I don't wanna go through this, man.

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.877
Listen, it happened,
and I'm sorry, and I feel bad.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.072
How long you gonna have me beg?
You know what I'm tryin' to say.

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:57.317
You gonna
milk all the apologies outta me.

01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.316
It's cool.

01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.635
- All right, man.
- My man.

01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:11.712
Yo, man! Whassup? Y'all gonna let a
girl come between us, man? What's up?

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.956
We supposed to be here, man.
We boys, man.

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:17.390
We don't hang out no more or nothin',
man. Man, this shit hurt, man.

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:21.195
- Y'all make up now, man.
- We just, you know, made up, man.

01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:22.196
Well, then, hug.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:26.155
We hugged just now, and gave
each other a pat and we boys again.

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:28.555
- All right. Give it to me.
- We hugged already.

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:32.395
No, man. I want
a big motherfuckin' hug, man.

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:35.080
Damn, man. I love y'all, man.

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.594
- Y'all ready to eat?
- Yeah.

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.676
All right.

01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:46.756
Yo, is that my shit?

01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:48.871
Damn, not the penthouse.

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:27.152
No. It's all wrong.
You know that memo I showed you?

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:30.670
Refer to it and show me
a new mock-up in the morning.

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:35.669
This is way off, Tye. We are not
gonna shoot this until it's right.

01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:37.756
- Angela.
- Come on.

01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:43.077
- Hi. We're lookin' for Angela...
- We are not.

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.514
What?

01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.795
Excuse me for a second, please.

01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:01.678
- What are you two doing here?
- Angela.

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:06.235
- I haven't seen you in so long.
- Four months, two weeks, to be exact.

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:09.318
- Thank you.
- We miss you. Where have you been?

01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:11.476
I miss you, too, and I've been working.

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:15.115
I got a new job. It's very demanding.
It requires me to work long hours,

01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:18.277
and I haven't had the time
to teach the class. I'm sorry.

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:20.436
You always had time for us.

01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:25.273
I know. Let me tell you somethin', OK?

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:31.069
You know what I had to do? I had
to rearrange my priorities in life.

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:34.670
Angela had to start
lookin' out for Angela.

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:39.477
- How'd you get here, anyway?
- Our new teacher brought us.

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:43.434
- Your new teacher? Where is she?
- He.

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:46.149
Well, where is he?

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:52.994
I think we best get goin' now.

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.509
Goodbye, my queen.

01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.914
- OK.
- Peace.

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:00.996
My brother.

01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:10.232
It's pretty low using the kids, Marcus.

01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:14.273
What else could I do? I been sendin'
you letters and I know you got 'em.

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:17.073
I'm just not real big
on words on paper these days.

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:20.796
OK. I know I fucked up.

01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:23.957
You're damn right you fucked up.
You hurt me.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:29.038
I miss you.

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:31.196
No. I really, really miss you.

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:34.790
I've never missed anybody in my life
and I miss you. I'm in love with you.

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:39.436
It isn't about your love. It's the fact that
you can't love me the way I deserve.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.437
That's what this is about.

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.348
You think I'd bother you unless I was
ready to be everything you wanted?

01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:48.233
I wanna be straight up about
everything. I want monogamy.

01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:50.271
You are my best friend. I'm miserable.

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:54.678
- I even quit my job because of you.
- Did I ask you to quit your job?

01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:59.429
- Why are you doin' this?
- Doing what?

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:02.996
Bein' all stiff and cold,
and hidin' behind your work.

01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:07.398
I'm taking care of my business,
and I suggest you take care of yours.

01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:09.078
Listen.

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:13.948
I know havin' a great job is cool
and all of that but...

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:17.435
you used to have a good time.

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:20.154
You used to be with these kids
and we used to have fun.

01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:22.191
We had a great life. You had everything.

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:26.598
Give me one reason
why I should take you back. One.

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:42.031
I didn't think you could.

01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:46.430
Do you still love me?

01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:52.278
Because I love you so much.

01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:57.875
I miss you.

01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:00.671
I'm scared.

01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.756
And I'm miserable.

01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:09.033
I can't breathe without you.
I can't breathe.

01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:12.076
I can't breathe.

01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:24.509
We should go get your things
and go to my place.

01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:28.599
No. I'm not moving into your house
this time. I'm staying in my place.

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:30.312
I want 24-7.

01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:32.112
- No.
- That's how committed I am.

01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:34.800
No. No. I'm not doin' it.

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.718
If you turn and look at her
I will break your fuckin' neck.

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:42.391
I was lookin' at this woman, thinkin'
about the future. That's you in 15 years.

01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:47.071
- You better still love me.
- She's by herself. I'm playin'. It's you.
