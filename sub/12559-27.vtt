REPEAT, SHAPE UP.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.775
NOISE IS
NOT EFFICIENCY.

15:49.824 --> 15:53.442
LET'S SECURE NOW.
AND WATCH THIS NOISE.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.116
YES, SIR.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.953
<i>[bell clanging]</i>

16:06.048 --> 16:08.176
UNLESS I'M VERY
MUCH MISTAKEN,

16:08.259 --> 16:11.342
IT IS ONE OF THOSE VERY ODD PHENOMENA.
AUTO SUGGESTION VVE CALL IT.

16:11.429 --> 16:14.638
A PERSON TALKS HIMSELF INTO
BELIEVING OCCURRENCES TAKE PLACE

16:14.682 --> 16:17.140
VVHEN INDEED THEY ARE PURE
FIGMENTS OF IMAGINATION.

16:17.226 --> 16:21.185
BEYOND THAT, MR. FLEMINGTON, THERE IS
\/ERY DEFINITELY SOME SUGGESTION HERE

16:21.272 --> 16:23.559
THAT YOU ARE \/ERY
RESENTFUL OF YOUR MOTHER.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.812
<i>AND HAVE A PREOCCUPATION WITH
HER IMAGINARYACHES AND PAINS.</i>

16:26.861 --> 16:29.148
MY GUESS AT LEAST FOR
THE MOMENT WOULD BE

16:29.197 --> 16:32.565
THAT THIS PARTICULAR FEELING
EXTENDED ITSELF TO YOUR VVIFE

16:32.658 --> 16:36.367
<i>WHO PROVIDED YOU WITH
A SIMILAR MOTHER IMAGE.</i>

16:36.454 --> 16:39.196
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS,
MR. FLEMINGTON,

16:39.290 --> 16:42.533
AND FORGIVE ME
IF I REPEAT MYSELF,

16:42.627 --> 16:46.086
THESE OCCURRENCES ARE PURE
FIGMENTS OF IMAGINATION.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.002
I BELIEVE THAT, DOCTOR.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.508
NOW, SNAP
YOUR FINGERS.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.350
WELL, DO YOU
THINK I, UH--

17:01.395 --> 17:04.183
GO AHEAD,
SNAP YOUR FINGERS.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.942
ANY ABNORMAL SOUND?

17:09.028 --> 17:10.894
NORMAL!

17:10.988 --> 17:13.025
STAMP YOUR FEET.

17:15.492 --> 17:18.359
<i>[stamps twice]</i>

17:18.454 --> 17:20.069
NORMAL AGAIN?

17:20.164 --> 17:23.498
HAPPILY, DELIGHTFULLY,
COMFORTINGLY NORMAL.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.226
YOU'VE CURED ME, DOCTOR.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.138
BY THE GOOD LORD HARRY,

17:46.232 --> 17:48.815
IF ADMIRAL NELSON HAD
HAD YOU AT TRAFALGAR,

17:48.901 --> 17:51.438
HE'D HAVE SAVED BOTH
HIS EYE AND HIS ARM.

17:51.529 --> 17:54.988
IN NAVAL PARLANCE,
SIR, YOU'RE 4.0.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.611
FOUR POINT OH, SIR,
IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.995
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
MR. FLEMINGTON.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.498
SLAM IT AT WILL,
BE MY GUEST.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.923
YOU, SIR, HAVE
THE SOUL OF A SEAMAN.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.295
BLESS YOU.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.839
<i>[singing to himself]</i>

18:21.767 --> 18:24.930
INCREDIBLE.
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.141
MIND OVER MATTER.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.563
MY WIFE OBVIOUSLY
THE CULPRIT

18:29.650 --> 18:34.110
A MISERABLE PREOCCUPATION VVITH NOISE
LITERALLY PLANTED THE SEED IN MY HEAD.

18:34.155 --> 18:38.114
INCREDIBLE VVHAT ONE CREVV MEMBER
CAN DC TC A VVHCLE SHIP'S COMPANY.

18:38.200 --> 18:42.159
AND THE WHOLE BUSINESS,
MIND OVER MATTER.

18:59.639 --> 19:04.054
MADAM, YOU ARE NOT VVELCOME ON
THIS PARTICULAR QUARTER DECK.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.976
NOR SHALL I STAY
HERE, ADMIRAL.

19:07.063 --> 19:09.179
I FORGOT SOME
OF MY JEWELRY.

19:09.273 --> 19:12.641
I VVILL RETRIEVE SAME AND THEN,
VVHETHER YOU PIPE ME ASHORE OR NOT,

19:12.693 --> 19:16.106
THAT'S PRECISELY
WHERE I'LL BE HEADING.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.072
AND MIGHT I
ADD THIS, MADAM,

19:20.159 --> 19:24.027
DESPITE YOUR EFFORTS TO OAPSIZE THIS
VVORTHY VESSEL, IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING,

19:24.121 --> 19:26.499
AGAINST THE ROCKS AND
HIDDEN SHOALS OF PETULANCE

19:26.540 --> 19:30.329
AND PETTY DISSATISFACTION,
THE SHIP REMAINS TIGHT

19:30.378 --> 19:33.871
AND ALL YOUR EFFORTS,
WORTHLESS AND WASTEFUL.

19:33.964 --> 19:38.174
HORATIO, OLD PAL, LET THE
FOLLOVVING BE MY FINAL COMMENTS:

19:38.260 --> 19:42.504
YOU ARE AN OVERGROVVN SAILOR
BOY VVITH AN UNDERMANNED HEAD.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.389
YOU ARE SO FULL
OF INCREDIBLE NEUROSES

19:45.476 --> 19:48.093
THAT I VVONDER THAT YOU
HAVEN'T CRACKED BEFORE THIS.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.519
BELAY THAT, MADAM,
BELAY THAT.

19:50.606 --> 19:54.270
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT I HA\/E
HAD A PSYCHIATRIC EXAMINATION,

19:54.360 --> 19:57.523
AND IF THERE IS ONE THING
WRONG WITH ME, IT IS YOU.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.605
IT IS SIMPLY YOU.
AND FURTHERMORE, MADAM,

20:00.700 --> 20:03.112
I CAN TELL YOU
ONE OTHER THING:

20:03.202 --> 20:06.365
THE WHOLE BUSINESS
IS MIND OVER MATTER.

20:06.455 --> 20:11.746
TOTALLY AND ABSOLUTELY
MIND OVER MATTER.

20:11.836 --> 20:15.579
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I CAN DO TO YOU?

20:15.673 --> 20:17.880
I CAN SHUT YOU OFF.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.541
DO YOU REALIZE THAT?

20:19.593 --> 20:22.255
I CAN LITERALLY
SHUT YOU OFF

20:22.346 --> 20:25.589
BECAUSE I AM A MAN
OF SUCH INCREDIBLE WILL

20:25.683 --> 20:27.890
THAT I CAN DO
ANYTHING I WANT TO DO.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.394
NOW, GO AHEAD.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.897
YELL AT ME.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.933

AT THIS MOMENT

20:39.822 --> 20:44.487
I AM IN THE PROCESS OF
EXERCISING MIND OVER MATTER.

20:44.577 --> 20:49.322
I AM SHUTTING YOU OUT.

20:49.415 --> 20:53.750
[muffled] FLEMINGTON, I
