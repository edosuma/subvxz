WEBVTT

01:21.168 --> 01:23.735
-  Stop right there.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.834
Put your hands
where I can see them.

01:40.274 --> 01:43.059
Shirt off!

01:43.059 --> 01:44.843
Come on!

01:52.851 --> 01:56.551
Pants off!
Come on, motherfucker.

01:56.551 --> 01:59.684
<i>I always thought
my life would end like this,</i>

01:59.684 --> 02:02.513
<i>in some godforsaken place,</i>

02:02.513 --> 02:06.082
<i>from a bullet
I didn't see coming.</i>

02:06.082 --> 02:08.215
<i>I just never thought I'd care.</i>

04:06.507 --> 04:08.987
<i>One thing
you don't want to see,</i>

04:08.987 --> 04:12.339
<i>me in a suit this early
in the morning.</i>

04:12.339 --> 04:14.254
<i>Means I'm working,</i>

04:14.254 --> 04:16.517
<i>which means someone is about</i>

04:16.517 --> 04:18.997
<i>to depart
this life unexpectedly.</i>

04:47.765 --> 04:49.463
- Stan.
-  <i>Yeah?</i>

04:49.463 --> 04:51.203
- He's late.
-  <i>It's all right.</i>

04:51.203 --> 04:52.640
<i>He'll be there, okay?</i>

04:52.640 --> 04:54.511
Hey, listen,
I can do the guy myself.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.644
- He's there right now.
-  <i>No, no, no, no.</i>

04:56.644 --> 04:59.124
<i>Besides, I promised Bobby T
we'd give this kid a shot.</i>

04:59.124 --> 05:00.778
<i>Supposed to be pretty good
with a knife.</i>

05:00.778 --> 05:02.911
Yeah, well that's what
you keep saying, but--

05:02.911 --> 05:05.305
<i>Well, uh, call me
when it's done, okay?</i>

05:05.305 --> 05:07.307
- He's here.
- Hey, I got these for Rollo.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.006
'Cause I-- I heard
he's a donut junkie.

05:11.006 --> 05:12.529
So, I told him that he won

05:12.529 --> 05:14.444
a dozen donuts
at our weekly raffle.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.838
He loves Boston creams.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.927
W-- what's with the suit?

05:20.755 --> 05:23.540
- What's with the shirt?
- Oh, it's part of the plan.

05:23.540 --> 05:24.933
I made it myself.

05:26.587 --> 05:29.590
- That's pretty smart, right?
-  Yeah.

05:29.590 --> 05:32.462
Except Krispy Kremes are spelled
with two K's.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.509
Who the fuck knows that?

05:35.509 --> 05:36.814
Not you.

05:53.614 --> 05:57.095
Okay, make it quick.
You get one chance.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.184
You fuck it up,
he's in the wind again.

05:59.184 --> 06:00.664
Hey.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.492
Don't worry, old timer.

06:08.846 --> 06:10.413
I got this shit.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.430
- Trevor!

06:31.739 --> 06:33.044
Yeah?

06:34.002 --> 06:35.133
What is this?

06:36.570 --> 06:39.355
All right, man.
All right. Thanks.

06:40.704 --> 06:41.836
See ya!

06:54.631 --> 06:57.460
- That was Rollo.
- Yeah.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.854
Why didn't you stab him?

06:59.854 --> 07:01.508
That's what I always do.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.771
- Hence why they call you Blade.
- Yeah.

07:03.771 --> 07:06.556
- I thought I'd do
something different.
-  Mm-hmm?

07:06.556 --> 07:09.472
I wanna show Stan some range
and imagination.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.824
What'd you do, poison him?

07:13.824 --> 07:15.870
- What the fuck?

07:15.870 --> 07:17.872
Boston cream, baby!

07:17.872 --> 07:20.527
Woo!

07:20.527 --> 07:21.919
Come on.

07:30.972 --> 07:32.669
What did you put in the donut?

07:32.669 --> 07:37.674
Uh, just, like,
a little blasting cap.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.459
Oh.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.461
I mean, how's Beggar

07:41.461 --> 07:43.854
gonna know it's Rollo
without his head?

07:44.464 --> 07:45.856
- Well, there's like a--
- Shut the fuck up.

07:47.379 --> 07:50.426
- Sweet Jesus.

07:50.426 --> 07:52.646
- Benny.
-  <i>How'd it go?</i>

07:54.038 --> 07:56.911
Kid fed Rollo a donut
with a bomb in it.

07:56.911 --> 07:59.522
- That sounds kinda cool.
-  Uh-huh.

08:01.698 --> 08:04.179
- Blew his head off.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.573
I mean-- uh,
Stan gonna shit himself.

08:06.573 --> 08:09.227
<i>Hey, listen,
there's no need to bother Stan.</i>

08:09.227 --> 08:10.925
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

08:10.925 --> 08:13.405
You know a guy
that knew Rollo, right?

08:13.405 --> 08:16.104
Find out if he had any family
around here, will ya?

08:16.104 --> 08:18.672
-  <i>All right.</i>

09:06.981 --> 09:08.678
Miss Kramer?

09:08.678 --> 09:11.551
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Rollo's dead.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.989
- Yes.
- Whacked?

09:14.989 --> 09:17.557
As it were, yes.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.210
As it were.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.083
Well, thanks for the heads up.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.085
I'll make sure to look up
that life insurance policy

09:24.085 --> 09:25.565
he never got around to getting.

09:31.396 --> 09:34.138
I came here to discuss
a problem that's arisen.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.577
And if I'm not interested
in your problem?

09:37.577 --> 09:38.795
Oh, well...

09:40.667 --> 09:42.233
I see.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.018
You'll slap duct tape
over my mouth

09:44.018 --> 09:46.150
and shove me in the trunk.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.152
Only if you're into
that kind of thing.

09:51.939 --> 09:53.810
Just wanna talk.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.385
Wait in the car, Donut.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.103
I'd offer you one,
but you just killed my ex.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.323
You don't seem too upset.

10:28.323 --> 10:30.891
I expected him to be deceased
long before today,

10:30.891 --> 10:33.023
given the business he was in.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.416
Huh.

10:36.505 --> 10:38.899
You have a thing
for dead animals, Miss Kramer?

10:38.899 --> 10:41.771
Marcie. I'm a taxidermist.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.991
Mm. Don't find many of those.

10:43.991 --> 10:45.383
It's a niche thing.

10:46.776 --> 10:48.082
He looks angry.

10:49.866 --> 10:53.261
Like someone stole his acorns
and he's gonna make 'em pay.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.263
Really?

10:55.263 --> 10:57.700
I'm not up
on my beaver expressions.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.747
- I could be wrong.
- I was going for indignant.

11:02.270 --> 11:04.054
Oh, yeah. I see it.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.928
Don't ever mess
with my acorns.

11:15.109 --> 11:17.677
I have a small problem,
Miss, uh--

11:17.677 --> 11:19.809
- Marcie.
- Marcie.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.768
I have to convince
a certain person

11:21.768 --> 11:24.988
that the body in that trunk
out there is indeed Rollo.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.034
Something happen to his face?

11:27.034 --> 11:29.993
Yeah. It's missing.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.734
Along with the rest of his head.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.955
There's five grand in it for you

11:34.955 --> 11:38.045
if you come with me and vouch
that Rollo is indeed Rollo.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.916
I could use the money.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.397
But I swore I'd never get back
into that world.

11:42.397 --> 11:45.661
So, I'll save you the dough
and myself some time.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.619
Brother's a tattoo artist.

11:47.619 --> 11:50.274
Gave Rollo and I matching
tattoos as a wedding gift.

11:50.274 --> 11:53.190
- Oh.
- Our ass cheeks.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.889
I had Rollo removed last year.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.978
Why'd you?

11:57.978 --> 11:59.544
Have him removed?

11:59.544 --> 12:01.503
I don't know.

12:01.503 --> 12:03.548
It's usually
along the lines of someone

12:03.548 --> 12:06.203
trying to fuck someone
else over, that type of thing.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.336
That type of thing would be
on the top of Rollo's resume.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.077
Well, there you go now.

12:10.077 --> 12:12.296
Anyway, he-- he made it
back here to Biloxi

12:12.296 --> 12:14.908
and it just happens
to be my boss's territory.

12:14.908 --> 12:18.259
So, we're being courteous to
our colleagues in New Orleans.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.870
I love how you guys
are so courteous.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.744
Pop the trunk, Donut.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.448
Horrible drapes.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.319
Yeah, they went nice
with the kitchen.

12:38.453 --> 12:42.022
- That's Rollo's ass.
- See? Come on, man.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.806
We didn't need his head,
after all.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.069
You got all pissy for nothing.

12:46.069 --> 12:48.898
- Why don't you...
- Oops.

12:48.898 --> 12:52.772
Bet you didn't know
Beggars and Rollo
were cellmates at Angola.

12:54.904 --> 12:57.689
Pretty sure he's seen
that tattoo up-close.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.691
Stan's not gonna
like this, Donut.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.911
- Stop calling me Donut!
- Okay.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.131
Get your gun out! Gun!

13:04.131 --> 13:05.262
Now.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.048
Put it in the car.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.791
Fuck Stan.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.097
Beggar said I could come
work for him anytime.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.882
He's moving up.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.927
And this'll prove
I'm ready for his crew.

13:24.281 --> 13:26.414
If I ever hear anybody call me
Donut again,

13:26.414 --> 13:28.938
I'm gonna come back
and I'm gonna gut you.

13:32.986 --> 13:35.162
- Old timer.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.908
Don't call me Donut,
motherfucker!

13:44.171 --> 13:45.825
I don't believe I got your name.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.262
Charlie.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.093
I'm moving up, baby!
I'm moving up!

13:53.093 --> 13:54.877
Woo!

13:58.011 --> 13:59.316
Ooh, sh--

14:03.668 --> 14:04.974
Oh, shit.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.369
Have you worked with him before?

14:08.369 --> 14:10.414
No, first time.

14:13.635 --> 14:17.117
- What a mess.
- It's okay. The car is stolen.

14:17.117 --> 14:20.033
I was referring to the kid.
Looks like he shot himself.

14:20.033 --> 14:23.297
Well, he was
more of a knife guy.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.130
Shit.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.348
Well...

14:33.046 --> 14:36.266
you know, they're kinda--

14:36.266 --> 14:38.442
kinda the same size.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.183
Maybe go visit your brother,

14:40.183 --> 14:43.708
the tattoo artist,
maybe he could, you know,

14:43.708 --> 14:45.406
kinda-- no?

14:50.541 --> 14:52.848
Fine, but I'm not cutting
his head off.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.851
<i>Yeah, Scotty Porter</i>

15:39.851 --> 15:41.723
<i>looking a lot more
active out there.</i>

15:41.723 --> 15:43.986
<i>He's really coming along,
that guy.</i>

15:43.986 --> 15:46.554
- You put cilantro in here?
- No.

15:46.554 --> 15:51.167
Well, I distinctly taste lemon.

15:51.167 --> 15:56.042
- Yeah. It's called lemon.
- I detest cilantro.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.957
That's why I used lemon.

16:01.438 --> 16:04.137
Did you-- did you get
this chicken at that Domenic's?

16:04.137 --> 16:08.315
Domenic's is in the North End.
We're in Biloxi.

16:09.490 --> 16:12.406
That's right, I don't know
what the heck's gotten into me.

16:12.406 --> 16:15.670
Anyway, the point is, it's
very good, don't get me wrong.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.151
It's very good,
even with the cilantro.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.807
I think personally that
you should open a restaurant.

16:22.807 --> 16:26.115
Well, the only way to make money
in that business is to skim.

16:27.247 --> 16:29.640
And you can't skim off yourself.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.382
No, well, I mean,
who in their right mind

16:32.382 --> 16:34.210
goes into
the restaurant business?

16:34.210 --> 16:36.996
There's no money in--
in the restaurant business.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.823
None whatsoever.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.782
You know, you have to
divest yourself

16:40.782 --> 16:42.131
of that notion, Charlie.

16:42.131 --> 16:43.567
- Uh-huh.
- What?

16:44.612 --> 16:45.830
Watch the game, Stan.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.921
<i>Stan Mullin, my boss.</i>

16:49.921 --> 16:52.620
<i>He's run Biloxi for 47 years.</i>

16:53.708 --> 16:56.189
<i>Been a while since he started
forgetting things.</i>

16:56.189 --> 16:57.451
Okay.

16:57.451 --> 16:58.843
<i>So, I took it upon myself</i>

16:58.843 --> 17:00.323
<i>to look out for him.</i>

17:00.323 --> 17:01.759
<i>I owed him that.</i>

17:01.759 --> 17:03.935
I got you some fish oils!

17:04.936 --> 17:06.416
Omega threes.

17:08.418 --> 17:09.898
Good for your heart.

17:14.555 --> 17:17.645
Leftovers are in the fridge
in case you're hungry later.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.995
Yeah.

17:19.995 --> 17:23.346
- Too bad about the kid.
- Yeah, it's a shame.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.218
What were you thinking,

17:25.218 --> 17:28.917
letting a young kid like that
do a job like that?

17:28.917 --> 17:30.179
I'm sorry, Stan.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.573
Won't let it happen again.

17:32.573 --> 17:35.967
- We gonna have any trouble?
- No.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.709
I took care of it.

17:44.193 --> 17:47.240
- Sleep well.
- Thanks, partner.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.554
<i>Beggar Mercado,</i>

18:40.554 --> 18:43.600
<i>street thug
turned Ninth Ward crew chief.</i>

18:43.600 --> 18:45.689
<i>One of the new breed of bosses</i>

18:45.689 --> 18:48.866
<i>cutting a swathe
through New Orleans.</i>

18:48.866 --> 18:50.216
Let's see.

19:10.671 --> 19:13.587
The guy who did him
got a little carried away.

19:15.632 --> 19:18.853
Kid named Blade.
Maybe you know him.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.073
Don't ring a bell, baby.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.294
And that's Rollo?

19:26.556 --> 19:27.775
It's him.

19:37.524 --> 19:40.091
- Where'd you find him?
-  There you go, man.

19:40.091 --> 19:42.311
Rental,
near the airport.

19:42.311 --> 19:44.922
Got him?

19:44.922 --> 19:46.707
With his ex's name on the lease.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.099
Dumb fuck.

19:58.719 --> 20:02.113
- How's Stan?
- Still Stan.

20:02.113 --> 20:04.594
I reached out to him
for a sit-down.

20:05.682 --> 20:07.336
He didn't reach back, though.

20:07.336 --> 20:10.731
I got a lot of ideas
I know he'd like.

20:10.731 --> 20:13.212
New construction,

20:13.212 --> 20:16.127
new casinos, hotels.

20:16.127 --> 20:17.738
Juicy territory.

20:20.131 --> 20:23.787
You're his guy.
Make it happen.

20:26.573 --> 20:27.748
We good?

21:03.958 --> 21:05.046
Ah.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.658
First time Rollo's ever
contributed anything

21:08.658 --> 21:09.746
to this relationship.

21:09.746 --> 21:11.139
Thanks.

21:13.446 --> 21:17.319
- By the way, why didn't you?
- What?

21:17.319 --> 21:20.496
Slap duct tape over my mouth,
put me next to Rollo?

21:20.496 --> 21:22.759
Not my style.

21:22.759 --> 21:26.415
Besides, you dealt
with the situation straight up.

21:27.677 --> 21:30.201
- Don' t see that often.
- From a woman?

21:31.768 --> 21:33.161
From anybody.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.425
Hey.

21:39.167 --> 21:40.821
You wanna get something to eat?

21:40.821 --> 21:44.477
- Wow, where'd that come from?
- My mouth.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.696
Which appears to have
circumvented my brain,

21:46.696 --> 21:47.828
but there you have it.

21:49.482 --> 21:52.136
- Why?

21:53.137 --> 21:55.662
- Celebrate.
- What, the dead guys?

21:57.577 --> 21:59.100
Problem solved.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.276
Situation avoided.

22:01.276 --> 22:02.712
Found money.

22:03.757 --> 22:04.888
You pick one.

22:09.110 --> 22:12.766
- Mm. Phenomenal.
- Good.

22:12.766 --> 22:15.203
Who'd have thunk you'd find
something this divine

22:15.203 --> 22:17.292
at a place called Tuscan Tomato.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.642
Well, the owner's from Treviso.

22:19.642 --> 22:21.601
A guy named Claudio.

22:21.601 --> 22:24.821
Not so good at English,
but fantastic chef.

22:24.821 --> 22:26.823
What's-- what-- what's in this?

22:26.823 --> 22:28.956
Malfatti,

22:28.956 --> 22:32.829
ricotta, flour
and, uh, blanched spinach.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.701
And you know this how?

22:34.701 --> 22:37.138
Well, I just like
to cook, you know?

22:37.138 --> 22:39.401
That's kind of like
a hobby for me.

22:39.401 --> 22:42.752
- But mostly Italian.
- Why Italian?

22:42.752 --> 22:46.887
Well, when I was stationed
in Italy for a while there,

22:46.887 --> 22:48.671
you know, I don't know.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.282
I just fell in love
with the culture.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.111
Love everything Italian.

22:57.245 --> 22:58.681
Why taxidermy?

22:58.681 --> 23:01.467
All right.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.338
I like giving everlasting life

23:03.338 --> 23:05.949
to something that didn't have
a fair chance at one.

23:05.949 --> 23:08.691
- Hmm.
- I restore their dignity.

23:08.691 --> 23:11.825
When I give
a hunter back his trophy,

23:11.825 --> 23:14.262
I want that animal
to haunt his dreams.

23:14.262 --> 23:16.569
That's an intriguing profession.

23:17.657 --> 23:20.660
No more than being
an enforcer for some mob.

23:23.532 --> 23:26.013
- I'm not an enforcer.
- Muscle, then.

23:26.013 --> 23:28.581
Lot of guys
with more muscle than me.

23:28.581 --> 23:30.844
All right.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.672
A trigger man, button guy.

23:34.587 --> 23:38.373
I'm more like a, um, concierge.

23:38.373 --> 23:40.462
- A fixer.
- Problem solver.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.638
Mm. Like...

23:44.335 --> 23:46.990
I got a body with no head
that needs identifying.

23:48.035 --> 23:49.166
Exactly.

23:50.167 --> 23:51.647
And if I needed tickets

23:51.647 --> 23:53.606
on the 50-yard line
for a Saints game?

23:53.606 --> 23:55.434
Yeah, I could get those for you.

23:56.696 --> 23:58.567
Who would you have
to kill to get 'em?

23:58.567 --> 24:00.830
Mm, depends on
who they're playing.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.050
Huh.

24:09.056 --> 24:11.841
Well, four stars
for the Tuscan Tomato.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.844
What do you think about...

24:17.499 --> 24:18.674
you know.

24:18.674 --> 24:20.633
Don't think so much, Charlie.

24:21.982 --> 24:24.071
Stay in the moment. Enjoy it.

24:24.071 --> 24:25.333
The rest?

24:26.029 --> 24:27.770
- Who knows?

24:43.046 --> 24:46.354
<i>Yeah.
What were you thinking,
Charlie?</i>

24:49.575 --> 24:54.405

25:12.902 --> 25:14.991
Happy birthday, Stan.
Happy birthday.

Blow 'em out, buddy!

25:17.603 --> 25:20.475
<i>My family.
Love 'em all.</i>

25:23.696 --> 25:26.133
Here we go now.
All right, Benny, there's yours.

25:26.133 --> 25:29.484
- I'm on a fuckin' diet, Charlie.
- I don't know about that, Benny.

25:29.484 --> 25:32.269
That's not what Celine tells me.
Hoo-hoo!

25:32.269 --> 25:34.315
- All right.
-  Thank you, Charlie.

25:35.359 --> 25:36.709
Thank you.

25:47.371 --> 25:49.330
<i>Benny Morin.</i>

25:49.330 --> 25:51.637

26:03.779 --> 26:05.346

26:05.346 --> 26:07.261
<i>When he found out he wasn't,</i>

26:07.261 --> 26:09.829
<i>he couldn't bring himself

26:09.829 --> 26:11.874
<i>So, he made him his chauffeur.</i>

26:11.874 --> 26:13.963

26:17.488 --> 26:20.013

26:20.013 --> 26:23.103
<i>New Girl, only don't

26:23.103 --> 26:25.584
<i>Been one of us

26:25.584 --> 26:27.673
<i>Saw her shoot

26:27.673 --> 26:29.718
<i>when he forgot
and called her that.</i>

26:31.415 --> 26:34.157
- Moist.
- Winn Dixie.

26:35.506 --> 26:39.075
So, this is what I merit now,
a store-bought birthday cake?

26:40.120 --> 26:43.689
Yeah, those fancy bakery cakes.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.168
They look great.

26:46.953 --> 26:48.258
Taste like shit.

26:51.566 --> 26:53.524
You go on home, Paul.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.657
- I'll finish up here.
- Thanks, Charlie.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.441
If you're gonna stay
for the game,

26:57.441 --> 26:59.530
don't forget
to give Stan his night pills.

26:59.530 --> 27:01.184
Otherwise, he sleep walks.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.273
Last week,
he almost walked into the pool.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.797
Later, Benny.

27:04.797 --> 27:06.102
You got it.

27:09.236 --> 27:10.846
Yeah.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.456
You know, I was thinking,

27:12.456 --> 27:14.676
uh, did you ever-- uh,

27:14.676 --> 27:17.418
did get one of those little,
uh, pretty fixer uppers?

27:17.418 --> 27:19.289
You know, where you used
to go all the time over there?

27:19.289 --> 27:20.595
All the time,
you'd go over there.

27:20.595 --> 27:23.337
- Italy.
- Italy. Yeah. Yeah.

27:23.337 --> 27:24.904
Yeah, no,
I'm-- I'm still searching.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.514
- What are you doing?
- I'm searching.

27:26.514 --> 27:27.646
- I'm still looking.
- Oh, still search--

27:27.646 --> 27:29.299
fuck a bunch of searching.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.345
Just do it.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.303
I'm gonna
tell you something right now.

27:33.303 --> 27:36.306
In 20 years from now,

27:36.306 --> 27:40.006
you'll be much more disappointed
at the things you didn't do then

27:40.006 --> 27:41.660
than the ones you did.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.705
Now, that's the only law
of the universe

27:43.705 --> 27:44.924
that's worth a shit.

27:44.924 --> 27:47.622
Well, there's a truth in that.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.972
Look at me. I'm set.

27:49.972 --> 27:51.887
I got a place
in Gulf Park

27:51.887 --> 27:55.369
I'm gonna spend my sunset days
watching them ponies.

27:55.369 --> 27:56.805
Playing 'em during the day

27:56.805 --> 27:59.068
and some rum punches at night.

27:59.068 --> 28:02.376
You know, now,
that sounds like a plan.

28:02.376 --> 28:05.466
Plan, you want-- you want God
to laugh, you make a plan.

28:12.908 --> 28:15.302
- Beggar.
- Huh?

28:15.302 --> 28:17.391
Beggar wants
a sit-down with you.

28:17.391 --> 28:19.132
What does he want
a sit-down with me for?

28:19.132 --> 28:21.177
He wants to run
some ideas by you.

28:21.177 --> 28:22.875
What kind of ideas
might he have?

28:22.875 --> 28:24.398
I don't know. I don't know.

28:24.398 --> 28:26.356
He said he reached out to you.

28:27.618 --> 28:30.099
Well, what,
does he got something?

28:30.099 --> 28:31.361
Maybe.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.757
All right.

28:35.757 --> 28:38.064
I'll tell you what.
Go ahead and set it up.

28:38.064 --> 28:41.371
I'm gonna sit him
right in front of me,

28:41.371 --> 28:44.418
this close, and I'll tell him
to go fuck himself.

28:44.418 --> 28:47.029
See, here's the thing
that I did learn, though,

28:47.029 --> 28:49.292
that you don't wrestle
with a pig.

28:49.292 --> 28:52.513
It'll get you dirty,
and he'll like it.

28:52.513 --> 28:53.688
Okay.

28:55.168 --> 28:56.256
All right.

28:58.562 --> 29:00.347
Stay away from that bum.

31:12.827 --> 31:13.872
Easy, now.

31:15.395 --> 31:17.963
You dumb fucks
ever heard of Ring doorbell?

31:19.442 --> 31:21.053
Put the gun down.

31:22.793 --> 31:23.882
Get him.

31:26.275 --> 31:29.409
- Go on. Get him. Pick him up.

31:38.809 --> 31:41.464
<i>You've reached Benny,

31:41.464 --> 31:44.641
Hey, Benny,

31:44.641 --> 31:46.252

You like gulls, don't you?

34:25.367 --> 34:26.542
Sure do.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.547
Let's go check it out.

34:31.547 --> 34:33.549
Why don't you
go feed the seagulls, huh?

34:33.549 --> 34:35.203
Thanks.

34:35.203 --> 34:37.162
Not too generous.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.467
Let's go.

34:41.644 --> 34:43.777
I see you got
the granddaughter visiting.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.870
I assume
you want to kill Beggar.

34:51.872 --> 34:54.396
You know I can't sanction that.

34:54.396 --> 34:56.442
You sanctioned a hit on Stan.

34:56.442 --> 34:57.747
No, I did not.

34:59.749 --> 35:01.708
That was a rogue move.
Nobody knew.

35:01.708 --> 35:03.144
Then, what's the issue?

35:03.144 --> 35:04.711
Beggar's an earner.

35:04.711 --> 35:07.148
Funnels a lot of money
into the coffers.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.628
And to stay vital,

35:08.628 --> 35:10.543
you gotta change your way
of thinking.

35:10.543 --> 35:12.458
Make room for the new guys.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.547
Stan was always fair with you.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.244
Stan's gone.

35:16.244 --> 35:18.333
And you should be, too,
if you're smart.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.119
I'm offering you that.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.950
I've always had one rule, Sal.

35:28.604 --> 35:30.954
Be good to the people
who were good to you.

35:30.954 --> 35:33.479
Then be good
to yourself, Charlie,

35:33.479 --> 35:35.829
and get as far away from here
as you can.

35:37.570 --> 35:39.441
Understand,

35:39.441 --> 35:40.877
if you kill Beggar--

35:40.877 --> 35:44.316
Hey. I came here out of respect.

35:45.969 --> 35:47.797
You do what you have to do.

35:53.934 --> 35:56.719
- What did Rollo have on Beggar?
- I don't know.

35:57.720 --> 36:00.549
But whatever it was
got him deceased.

36:00.549 --> 36:02.812
Where is he, Beggar?

36:02.812 --> 36:04.901
Why don't you ask
one of your crew?

36:04.901 --> 36:06.033
I would.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.818
But they're all dead.

36:10.385 --> 36:11.647
You sure about that?

36:17.827 --> 36:19.438
<i>All right, Benny,</i>

36:19.438 --> 36:21.222
<i>there's yours,
here you go, Celine.</i>

36:21.222 --> 36:23.006
<i>- Thanks, Charlie.
- You seen Blade?</i>

36:23.006 --> 36:24.660
<i>Hmm?</i>

36:24.660 --> 36:27.141
<i>You seen Blade?</i>

36:27.141 --> 36:29.143
<i>Do I look
like his parole officer?</i>

37:00.392 --> 37:01.871
Charlie Swift.

37:01.871 --> 37:03.351
Uh, Celine.

37:06.093 --> 37:08.748
- Is Benny around?
- You just missed him.

37:08.748 --> 37:11.751
He went to go meet
some guys over at the club.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.367
I was just gonna call him.
I'll tell him you stopped by.

37:38.560 --> 37:42.521
I always say goodbye
to him before work.

37:42.521 --> 37:44.131
It's just our thing.

37:46.481 --> 37:49.397
Didn't say it today
for some reason.

37:55.621 --> 37:57.971
You tell him I meant to.

38:06.762 --> 38:08.416
<i>Betrayal's a funny thing.</i>

38:09.809 --> 38:13.247
<i>Its very nature
is to catch you unaware.</i>

38:13.247 --> 38:16.598
<i>This one was a gut punch
I never saw coming.</i>

38:18.818 --> 38:21.473
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Giselle.

38:22.604 --> 38:25.085
You comin' over
after my shift tomorrow?

38:27.653 --> 38:29.307
I might have to
take a rain check.

38:30.525 --> 38:31.613
I'll let you know.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.318
- Charlie.
- Milt.

38:41.710 --> 38:43.625
I thought
you were doing collections.

38:43.625 --> 38:46.193
- Not bouncer work.
-  Right, sit on it.

38:46.193 --> 38:49.109
- Place is under new management.
-  Come on, one more.

38:49.109 --> 38:51.285
- Beggar's guys already move in?
-  Nice.

38:51.285 --> 38:53.026
Soon as the lights came on.

38:53.026 --> 38:56.246
-  Ooh! Give me some shake!
- Like roaches.

38:56.246 --> 38:57.944
You moved in
with Esther, I hear.

38:57.944 --> 39:00.294
I bet you she'd be glad
to see you come home

39:00.294 --> 39:01.513
early for supper.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.558
I'll bring her some wings.

39:03.558 --> 39:05.647
Maybe I'll get lucky.

39:05.647 --> 39:07.345
Don't forget to get a receipt.

39:10.957 --> 39:13.351
Yeah, that's it!

39:19.095 --> 39:20.836
That's it! Whoo!

39:35.416 --> 39:38.071
Charlie. No. No.

39:41.553 --> 39:44.817
Charlie, Beggar said
Stan was finished here.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.427
He wasn't the same, Charlie.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.995
He wasn't
always right in the head.

39:48.995 --> 39:50.518
You turned on your own.

39:50.518 --> 39:52.477
I had to
make a choice for myself.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.696
Where's Beggar?

39:54.696 --> 39:57.177
He's been on the move
since this thing went down.

39:57.177 --> 40:00.310
Out of his fuckin' mind,
looking for whatever
that Rollo guy had on him.

40:00.310 --> 40:03.270
He's got the whole gang
looking for it.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.315
You ought
to get out of Biloxi, Charlie.

40:06.882 --> 40:09.276
That's what everyone
keeps telling me.

40:30.471 --> 40:33.953
Ooh, baby!

41:15.690 --> 41:17.083
Esther likes to eat late.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.232
Miss Kramer.

41:36.232 --> 41:38.234
<i>Hello, Mr. Swift.</i>

41:38.234 --> 41:40.802
<i>Just calling to say thanks

41:40.802 --> 41:43.065
I was hoping
to get him home for the weekend.

41:43.065 --> 41:45.546
I have a ferret

41:45.546 --> 41:49.028

41:49.028 --> 41:51.900
<i>so your little friend's

41:51.900 --> 41:54.076
<i>By the way,
where'd you find him?</i>

41:54.076 --> 41:57.950
Southeast corner
of Euclid and Grand.

41:57.950 --> 42:03.129
<i>- He got a name?</i>
- Uh-huh. Rocky.

42:03.129 --> 42:04.609
Original.

42:04.609 --> 42:06.915
Well,
it's the Smith of raccoons.

42:09.788 --> 42:11.920
I'm gonna need
a little more time with him,

42:11.920 --> 42:13.052
due to the tire marks.

42:14.140 --> 42:15.402
Take your time.

42:17.709 --> 42:20.712

44:26.707 --> 44:28.970
<i>Tony,
did you find the package?</i>

44:30.232 --> 44:31.494

44:32.452 --> 44:34.149

44:34.149 --> 44:36.674
I am impressed.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.240
He was my second-best guy.

44:39.241 --> 44:41.461
Well, looking forward

45:05.877 --> 45:10.055

46:09.810 --> 46:11.638
I'd be repeating myself.

46:11.638 --> 46:14.423
I could say it slower,
or I could draw you a picture.

46:14.423 --> 46:16.382
I don't know

46:24.346 --> 46:27.567
- Long billed woodcock.
- Yeah?

46:27.567 --> 46:30.004
Girl, I got
a big ole woodcock on me.

46:30.004 --> 46:32.877
That's real clever,
for a 12-year-old.

46:36.315 --> 46:39.797
Can you put that down,
I've been working on it
for 30 hours already.

46:39.797 --> 46:42.277
What happened to him?
He got hit by a truck?

46:42.277 --> 46:45.063
Some shithead
loaded it with birdshot.

46:46.368 --> 46:48.327
I don't see no birdshot.

46:48.327 --> 46:50.982
No? Look here.

46:50.982 --> 46:52.070
Turn it over.

46:53.680 --> 46:54.899
Right there.

47:33.633 --> 47:35.548
This a bad time?

48:39.351 --> 48:40.874
Fucking Catholic.

48:44.443 --> 48:48.621
Now I see
why you like that old man car.

48:52.407 --> 48:53.713
Rollo was here.

48:55.410 --> 48:58.022
He showed up
about four days before you did.

48:58.022 --> 49:01.025
Told me he'd give me 50 grand
if I would help him rent

49:01.025 --> 49:04.376
a place to lay low
while he was working
some shakedown scheme.

49:04.376 --> 49:08.293
I told him the whole thing
was gonna blow up in his face,
and it did.

49:08.293 --> 49:09.424
Literally.

49:12.645 --> 49:13.776
What now?

49:13.776 --> 49:16.518
Well, I'm gonna dump these guys,

49:16.518 --> 49:19.957
then head to New Orleans,
Rollo's home turf.

49:19.957 --> 49:22.133
Pretty sure whatever
they're looking for is there.

49:22.133 --> 49:24.309
Probably
right next to my 50 grand.

49:24.309 --> 49:26.354
- I don't think
that's a good idea.
- Do you have a better idea?

49:26.354 --> 49:28.356
- What would you have me do?
Sit in some hotel room?
- I don't--

49:28.356 --> 49:30.141
Wait for you to tell me
the coast is clear?

49:30.141 --> 49:32.360
- What if you get killed first?
- Well--

49:32.360 --> 49:34.319
And then, I wake up one day,
and there's another
Mutt and Jeff

49:34.319 --> 49:36.234
at the foot of my bed
holding duct tape and 45s?

49:36.234 --> 49:38.497
Besides, do you have
any idea where Rollo lived,

49:38.497 --> 49:41.456
where he hung out,
the morons he rolled with?

49:41.456 --> 49:44.938
I do. That 50 grand could really
change things for me.

49:44.938 --> 49:46.722
I'm gonna find it,
with or without you.

49:48.550 --> 49:49.725
Pack light.

50:34.857 --> 50:39.123
So, this 50 grand,

50:39.123 --> 50:42.517
what are you gonna do with it
if you find it, anyway?

50:42.517 --> 50:44.345
LSU campus in Baton Rouge,

50:44.345 --> 50:46.173
they have
a Natural History Museum.

50:47.261 --> 50:49.611
Uh, they said
that they would like to hire me

50:49.611 --> 50:51.874
to be the director
of avian exhibits.

50:51.874 --> 50:54.921
- Hmm. Professor.
- No, not quite.

50:54.921 --> 50:56.618
But they like my work.

50:56.618 --> 50:58.664
Said if I got certified,
the job was mine.

50:59.882 --> 51:02.233
Twenty thousand
pays for the course,

51:02.233 --> 51:03.973
five thousand
in moving expenses,

51:03.973 --> 51:05.845
and the rest
for a starter place.

51:08.456 --> 51:10.806
Plus, a change of scenery
would be good for me.

51:12.286 --> 51:13.505
New start.

51:20.642 --> 51:23.341
What about you?
You have any plans
when this is over?

51:26.387 --> 51:29.999
My line of work, it's best
not to have any long-term plans.

51:34.917 --> 51:36.441
You must think about something.

51:39.618 --> 51:41.054
Mm-hmm.

51:57.984 --> 52:00.204
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey! ♪</i>

52:20.311 --> 52:23.140
- What is this?
- A place nobody knows.

52:25.185 --> 52:28.232
However,
it does have a kitchen.

52:32.018 --> 52:34.977
- Mm?
- So good.

52:34.977 --> 52:37.806
Hmm. Yeah.

52:40.940 --> 52:42.811
So, Beggar,

52:42.811 --> 52:45.640
he decides to make his move,
and he wipes everyone out.

52:45.640 --> 52:47.294
You end up
being the last man standing?

52:48.991 --> 52:51.559
Well, it would appear that way.

52:51.559 --> 52:53.213
Well, why didn't you run?

52:54.693 --> 52:59.785
Stan Mullen, my boss,
my friend of 33 years.

52:59.785 --> 53:02.396
A man who played by the rules,
kept his word,

53:02.396 --> 53:04.181
did well by people.

53:06.052 --> 53:08.010
He deserved
to go out on his terms,

53:08.010 --> 53:09.273
only he didn't get to.

53:11.405 --> 53:12.798
Stan's dead, Charlie.

53:14.191 --> 53:15.975
Why does this mean
so much to you?

53:20.371 --> 53:21.807
When I was five,

53:23.156 --> 53:25.463
I'd wait at the door
for my pops to come home.

53:28.379 --> 53:30.685
My cowboy hat on,
my boots on, my gun on.

53:30.685 --> 53:33.166
He'd come in, I'd give him
a gun, and he'd say "draw."

53:33.166 --> 53:36.256
Now, obviously,
a 25, 26-year-old man's

53:36.256 --> 53:38.432
gonna beat a five-year-old kid
to the draw.

53:38.432 --> 53:40.260
But what bothered me was...

53:42.044 --> 53:43.437
that every day...

53:45.047 --> 53:47.789
every single day,
he'd beat me to the draw.

53:48.921 --> 53:51.271
He'd make me
put my hands up in the air,

53:51.271 --> 53:53.317
turn round and face the wall.

53:54.535 --> 53:56.189
Then he'd shoot me in the back.

53:59.627 --> 54:01.150
Every day, he did that.

54:05.198 --> 54:06.939
Then, one day,
I reared up and I said,

54:06.939 --> 54:08.680
you know, "What's
the sense of facing the wall

54:08.680 --> 54:10.334
if you're gonna
shoot me in the back?"

54:10.334 --> 54:11.900
And he said,
"Well, maybe today, I won't."

54:11.900 --> 54:13.424
So, I turn around,
face the wall, and...

54:15.469 --> 54:16.862
...shot me in the back.

54:21.562 --> 54:22.607
Hated him.

54:26.524 --> 54:28.177
Now, one night...

54:28.177 --> 54:30.092
...one night, I tell this
to Stan, and he says,

54:30.092 --> 54:32.312
"When he came home,
you should be waiting for him.

54:32.312 --> 54:34.227
Soon as he came in,
you should've been hiding

54:34.227 --> 54:37.143
behind the door,
and shot him in the back.

54:37.143 --> 54:40.929
I mean, fuck giving him a gun,
and fuck giving him a chance."

54:40.929 --> 54:45.020
He says, "In life, you can play
by someone else's rules

54:45.020 --> 54:46.500
or you can play by your own.

54:46.500 --> 54:48.241
You play
by someone else's rules,

54:48.241 --> 54:49.938
you're gonna
get fucked every time

54:49.938 --> 54:52.463
'cause it's their design,
not yours."

54:55.596 --> 54:57.903
My old man was just trying
to teach me a lesson.

55:00.819 --> 55:02.386
Stan got me to see that.

55:06.520 --> 55:08.261
Hmm. Lifted the weight

55:08.261 --> 55:10.785
I carried in my heart

59:01.842 --> 59:03.844
You sure you wanna stay?

59:03.844 --> 59:05.933
I wanna finish
going through everything.

59:05.933 --> 59:08.457
Just the stuff he wouldn't
let me have when I took off.

59:08.457 --> 59:10.808
I'll take an Uber
back to your place.

59:16.553 --> 59:20.121
-  <i>AirLine Inn.</i>

59:20.121 --> 59:22.820
- Yes, good afternoon there.
<i>- Oh, good afternoon, sir.</i>

59:22.820 --> 59:25.344
My name is Mr. Kramer.
Yes, good afternoon to you.

59:25.344 --> 59:28.521
Listen, I'd like to check
on my room charges, please.

59:28.521 --> 59:31.045
But I seem
to have misplaced my bill.

59:31.045 --> 59:33.874
<i>If you'd like, I can send
a current bill up to your room.</i>

59:33.874 --> 59:36.224
<i>Oh, that would be
so much appreciated.</i>

59:36.224 --> 59:38.226
<i>Could you send
maintenance up there,</i>

59:38.226 --> 59:40.054
<i>please, check on my toilet?</i>

59:40.054 --> 59:42.100
<i>You know, just keeps
running and running.</i>

59:42.100 --> 59:44.798
<i>Of course. Room 704. Coming up.</i>

01:00:08.474 --> 01:00:10.041
Hey!

01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:11.869
Couldn't find anything.

01:00:11.869 --> 01:00:14.349
I tightened your valve.
Seems to be working, so...

01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:16.308
Thanks, man. Here you go.

01:00:16.308 --> 01:00:18.571
Damn thing kept me up all night.

01:00:19.659 --> 01:00:22.009
- Have a good day.
-  You got it.

01:01:37.171 --> 01:01:38.520
Shit.

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:08.159
<i>Attention, all hotel guests!</i>

01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:10.727
<i>There is an active shooter
in the hotel.</i>

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.119
<i>Please seek shelter.</i>

01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:22.739
<i>Keep your room door locked
until further notice.</i>

01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:31.748
<i>There's an active shooter
in the hotel.</i>

01:02:33.662 --> 01:02:36.840
<i>Keep your room door locked
until further notice.</i>

01:04:26.123 --> 01:04:28.038
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

01:04:31.911 --> 01:04:34.000
-  Jesus, Charlie.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.089
- What the hell happened?
- I got shot.

01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:38.309
- By who?
- Oh, some guy.

01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:40.180
A guy?
A guy like you, you mean.

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:43.923
Mm. This one was different.
Deluxe model.

01:04:45.446 --> 01:04:46.665
Beggar's number one.

01:04:48.275 --> 01:04:50.060
Could be you're in over
your head, Charlie.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:53.019
Been doing all right
up until today.

01:04:53.019 --> 01:04:55.500
Rollo was doing all right
'til he wasn't.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.676
Don't get any ideas

01:04:59.199 --> 01:05:01.985
about stuffing me
before I bleed to death.

01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:03.073
I wouldn't.

01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:05.553
No?

01:05:05.553 --> 01:05:06.859
Why not?

01:05:06.859 --> 01:05:09.079
I couldn't capture your essence.

01:05:09.079 --> 01:05:10.819
You capture
a raccoon's essence.

01:05:10.819 --> 01:05:12.604
You're an entirely
different creature.

01:05:12.604 --> 01:05:15.476
Hm. Well, that's for sure.

01:05:16.825 --> 01:05:18.915
Oh, for God sake's, Charlie. Here.

01:05:20.177 --> 01:05:23.180
You know,
you really oughta start thinking
about an exit plan.

01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:26.226
A place to retire,

01:05:26.226 --> 01:05:28.185
assuming you'll have a say
in the matter.

01:05:31.362 --> 01:05:34.365
I was thinking about
buying one of these.

01:05:34.365 --> 01:05:35.540
Hmm.

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.716
They go for a dollar.

01:05:37.716 --> 01:05:40.414
Of course, you only have to
promise that you'll fix them up.

01:05:40.414 --> 01:05:43.765
But, you know, it's beautiful.

01:05:46.594 --> 01:05:47.682
This one's in Umbria.

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:52.383
I mean, you can find these
all over Italy.

01:05:52.383 --> 01:05:55.429
- How long you been looking?
- Couple of years.

01:05:55.429 --> 01:05:58.563
Well, what are you waiting for?
For them to go down to 50 cents?

01:06:00.695 --> 01:06:02.567
It's a beautiful dream, Charlie.

01:06:05.439 --> 01:06:06.614
You oughta go for it.

01:06:08.703 --> 01:06:09.922
Hmm.

01:06:14.361 --> 01:06:15.406
Yeah.

01:06:16.668 --> 01:06:18.539
I heard that
somewhere before once.

01:06:38.951 --> 01:06:41.040
-  What's funny?

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:45.914
Rollo's got a price on his head
and is running for his life.

01:06:45.914 --> 01:06:49.309
Still, he calls his mama
three times from the hotel.

01:06:57.883 --> 01:07:02.061
Well,
if it isn't "Ms. Whores R Us."

01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:07.110
- Who the fuck are you?
- He's a friend of Rollo's.

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:09.634
Doesn't look like
any of his friends.

01:07:09.634 --> 01:07:12.115
Any come by recently?

01:07:12.115 --> 01:07:15.727
You claimin' I entertain
my son's friends here
for a small fee?

01:07:15.727 --> 01:07:19.557
- There's a shed out back
he uses as his man cave.
- Don't you touch his shit!

01:07:20.427 --> 01:07:22.255
All right. Where is it?

01:07:22.255 --> 01:07:24.562
- What?
- The lockbox.

01:07:24.562 --> 01:07:27.608
Probably up your gaping asshole,
son stealer.

01:07:58.509 --> 01:08:01.642
That ain't your property,
you testicle sucker.

01:08:01.642 --> 01:08:03.557
What's in it,
he promised to me.

01:08:04.515 --> 01:08:06.169
If he wanted you to have it,

01:08:06.169 --> 01:08:07.909
he'd have shoved it
up your cooch.

01:08:07.909 --> 01:08:10.260
Lord knows it's big enough.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.870
Remember my wedding day, Mavis?

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:14.916
You were running around
with a Budweiser in one hand

01:08:14.916 --> 01:08:16.918
and your Uncle Fred's dick
in the other.

01:08:19.312 --> 01:08:24.143
July 29, seven, two, nine.

01:08:30.628 --> 01:08:32.151
What'd you expect
to find in there?

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:36.242
50 grand?
In unmarked 20s and 50s?

01:08:36.242 --> 01:08:38.375
- Where is it?
- You're looking at it.

01:08:41.508 --> 01:08:43.945
25K each.

01:08:43.945 --> 01:08:45.773
- Double Ds.
-  Oh, God.

01:08:45.773 --> 01:08:49.342
Nipples the size
of silver dollars now.

01:09:14.019 --> 01:09:15.934
I'm sorry about your 50K.

01:09:15.934 --> 01:09:18.632
Yeah, well, it was a long shot
from the get-go.

01:09:20.112 --> 01:09:21.983
At least your disc
is still out there somewhere.

01:09:21.983 --> 01:09:23.768
- Mm-hmm.
- Mine turned
into a pair of double Ds.

01:09:23.768 --> 01:09:27.119
Sure did.

01:09:27.119 --> 01:09:30.427
Augh, I should've slammed
the door in his face
the moment I saw him.

01:09:30.427 --> 01:09:32.646
You gotta wonder
what's wrong with me
that I didn't.

01:09:32.646 --> 01:09:34.518
It's hard to let go of hope.

01:09:37.695 --> 01:09:40.176
I gotta learn to let go
of a lot of things.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.876
Looks like the bus station's
just a few blocks.

01:09:44.876 --> 01:09:46.443
You can, uh, drop me there.

01:09:48.358 --> 01:09:49.402
Yeah.

01:09:52.144 --> 01:09:53.189
What you gonna do?

01:09:54.407 --> 01:09:55.495
Survive.

01:09:56.888 --> 01:09:59.760
We can either
make ourselves miserable
or make ourselves stronger.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.284
The amount of work is the same.

01:10:03.373 --> 01:10:04.939
You?

01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:09.640
Oh, I suppose I'll keep looking.

01:10:10.771 --> 01:10:13.948
- Why?
- I don't like loose ends.

01:10:13.948 --> 01:10:16.777
Ah. I hope they don't kill you
before you find it, then.

01:10:16.777 --> 01:10:19.519
Thank you.
I appreciate the sentiment.

01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:24.916
Oh, no.
I got it from here, Charlie.

01:10:24.916 --> 01:10:26.744
- It's a loan, okay?
- No, please don't.

01:10:26.744 --> 01:10:28.702
- Marcie, just--
- No. Look, a loan means

01:10:28.702 --> 01:10:30.400
you're gonna be coming back
for me.

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.271
And then I gotta wonder
if you made it or not.

01:10:32.271 --> 01:10:35.492
And then I gotta hope
you didn't change your mind.

01:10:37.842 --> 01:10:40.323
- I can tell you
right now that I'll--
- Charlie, don't.

01:10:47.634 --> 01:10:50.158
Here, it's just, uh,
just a couple blocks that way.

01:10:51.551 --> 01:10:52.639
Yeah.

01:11:01.692 --> 01:11:04.129
Look, you got something
you gotta do...

01:11:05.783 --> 01:11:07.611
and a lot can happen
between then and now.

01:11:07.611 --> 01:11:10.396
Let's just leave it here, okay?

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.402
Don't you be in love with me,
Charlie Swift.

01:11:20.319 --> 01:11:21.842
Too late.

01:11:43.473 --> 01:11:45.257
I know where your thing is.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:50.088
Beggar's bar.
Rollo used to manage it.

01:11:51.785 --> 01:11:54.614
Last thing he said to me was
it's right under their noses.

01:11:56.137 --> 01:11:57.356
All right. Got it?

01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:01.404
Where is he, Ronnie?
Where's that weasel?

01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:03.275
- I know he's hiding here somewhere.
- Marcie.

01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:05.625
-  Where is he hiding?
- Um, Rollo?

01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:07.845
- Marcie, Rollo's dea--
- You're a shitty liar.

01:12:07.845 --> 01:12:10.630
You always were.
You back there, Rollo?

01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:13.546
You pull a gun on me again,
and I'll shove it up your ass!

01:12:14.112 --> 01:12:16.070
Where are you hiding,
you piece of shit?

01:12:18.159 --> 01:12:21.032
You were sleeping up there? Huh?

01:12:22.642 --> 01:12:24.035
Come on, I got bills to pay!

01:12:26.559 --> 01:12:28.561
Come on!

01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:29.780
Face me, you coward!

01:12:54.892 --> 01:12:56.720
If you see that cum stain,
you tell him

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:58.852
he better give me my 50 grand,
or I'll cut his dick off.

01:12:58.852 --> 01:13:02.203
- Wait, what's the rush, Marcie?
- I think Beggar's looking
for you.

01:13:02.203 --> 01:13:04.510
- Fuck off me!
- Won't you hang tight
while I give him a call?

01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:06.077
Let me go, you dick!

01:13:06.077 --> 01:13:08.079
Step away from the lady.

01:13:08.079 --> 01:13:10.516
- I don't see no lady here.

01:13:10.516 --> 01:13:13.214
-  Look again.

01:13:13.214 --> 01:13:15.042
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13:15.042 --> 01:13:18.829
Hands, now, hands, hands.
Nice and easy. There you go.

01:13:18.829 --> 01:13:21.484
You go back to the safe house.

01:13:21.484 --> 01:13:23.311
I'll disable this crew.

01:13:24.312 --> 01:13:25.966
Yeah. Hold onto this for me.

01:13:29.056 --> 01:13:31.189
Nice and easy. Up.

01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:33.365
Get your ass up!

01:13:33.365 --> 01:13:35.019
Back up into the bar.

01:13:35.933 --> 01:13:38.414
Down. Get on your knees.
Get on your knees!

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:43.201
Now, can any of you dumb fucks
count to ten?

01:13:43.201 --> 01:13:45.464
'Cause that's how many rounds
I have.

01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:47.553
Which means one of you

01:13:47.553 --> 01:13:49.425
might just get out of here alive.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:52.993
Only one that's gonna
get deceased is you.

01:13:55.343 --> 01:13:57.998
I'd do you right here,
let these fucking clowns
clean up the mess,

01:13:57.998 --> 01:14:01.262
but Beggar wants to feed you
to the gators himself.

01:14:01.262 --> 01:14:04.178
Just you and him.

01:14:04.178 --> 01:14:06.137
He'll have a lot to chew on.

01:14:34.905 --> 01:14:36.559
You exclusive to Beggar?

01:14:41.085 --> 01:14:42.216
Next exit.

01:15:43.234 --> 01:15:44.757
Is he dead?

01:15:44.757 --> 01:15:47.107
I'm calling the cops...

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:18.356
Come on, Marcie. Come on.

01:16:21.011 --> 01:16:23.491
<i>This is Marcie Kramer, taxidermist.</i>

01:16:23.491 --> 01:16:25.145
<i>- Please leave your message.</i>
- Shit.

01:16:30.368 --> 01:16:33.545
Yes, Marcie? Are you okay?

01:16:33.545 --> 01:16:35.939
<i>You just won't die, will you?</i>

01:16:36.853 --> 01:16:38.376
Your old dumping grounds.

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.771
You got one hour
before I shoot her in the head.

01:16:45.818 --> 01:16:49.213
You piece of fucking shit.

01:17:19.852 --> 01:17:21.201
Stop right there!

01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:30.080
- Put your hands
where I can see them.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:33.649
<i>Always thought
my life would end like this.</i>

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:36.521
<i>From a bullet
I didn't see coming.</i>

01:17:36.521 --> 01:17:38.131
Shirt off!

01:17:38.131 --> 01:17:40.525
<i>I just never thought I'd care.</i>

01:17:40.525 --> 01:17:42.919
<i>Only, I did care.</i>

01:17:42.919 --> 01:17:45.573
I'm okay, Charlie. Don't worry.

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:51.928
Pants off!

01:17:51.928 --> 01:17:53.494
Come on, motherfucker.

01:17:54.582 --> 01:17:56.802
<i>So, I was gonna
have to pull off a magic trick</i>

01:17:56.802 --> 01:17:59.109
<i>with nothing up my sleeve</i>

01:17:59.109 --> 01:18:01.285
<i>or down my pants.</i>

01:18:01.285 --> 01:18:03.591
Keep your hands up!

01:18:04.767 --> 01:18:06.420
Turn around! Slow!

01:18:08.118 --> 01:18:09.815
<i>Impossible, right?</i>

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:15.603
Okay, okay, okay. Take it easy.

01:18:15.603 --> 01:18:17.910
- Fifteen seconds to give me
that disc.

01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:19.825
<i>Think again.</i>

01:18:19.825 --> 01:18:21.653
- Her first.

01:18:21.653 --> 01:18:24.264
- The next one's in her neck.

01:18:24.264 --> 01:18:27.572
- Ten!
- I need to know she's okay.

01:18:39.627 --> 01:18:42.761
- What happened?
- Bitch didn't come quietly
when I asked her to.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:47.810
- You okay?
- Just give him the disc.

01:18:50.247 --> 01:18:54.251
I was thinking about the houses,
the fixer-uppers in Italy.

01:18:56.644 --> 01:18:59.082
Why I didn't pull the trigger
on one.

01:19:01.258 --> 01:19:03.347
I was waiting for someone
to come with me.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.959
You know,
didn't see the point in...

01:19:06.959 --> 01:19:10.136
living that kind of dream
all alone.

01:19:13.009 --> 01:19:15.185
You got five seconds, Romeo!

01:19:15.185 --> 01:19:18.188
You can have the disc.

01:19:18.188 --> 01:19:21.582
Only, there's a small problem.

01:19:22.932 --> 01:19:24.542
I ain't the one
with the problem.

01:19:24.542 --> 01:19:27.414
Yeah, you are.

01:19:27.414 --> 01:19:31.375

<i>Here's the name of the boat

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:39.165

<i>'til I'm the man.</i>

01:19:46.216 --> 01:19:48.305
I had to run it by Sal,

01:19:48.305 --> 01:19:50.786
make sure he was okay
with me killing you.

01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:53.919
Marcie?

01:19:55.703 --> 01:19:57.009
What's that on your shoe?

01:20:04.147 --> 01:20:06.105
Oh!

01:20:15.201 --> 01:20:17.116
Much appreciated, Milt.

01:20:19.118 --> 01:20:21.512

- Oh, nobody.

Oh. Wait, what's this?

01:20:34.873 --> 01:20:37.441
Well, it's a start.

01:20:37.441 --> 01:20:39.225

This is Marcie.

01:21:59.088 --> 01:22:02.352

-  Really?
-  Yeah.

01:22:14.799 --> 01:22:17.106

- Yeah.

01:22:54.447 --> 01:22:56.754
