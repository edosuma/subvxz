She's worked this area
for a couple of years now,

17:38.520 --> 17:42.360
but she wasn't most Johns' first pick,
if you know what I mean.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.640
What happened?

17:44.760 --> 17:47.240
Looks like our guy again.
One of the other girls found her.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.640
All of the air passages are blocked
with what appears to be...

17:49.680 --> 17:52.680
the same viscous hydrochloric acid
we found on Lauren Mackalvey.

17:52.760 --> 17:55.760
You know what this stuff is?

17:57.360 --> 17:59.320
Hey, this is still my case.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.320
We're dealing with
a serial murderer...

18:01.360 --> 18:03.760
who's using an on-line service
to attract his victims.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.760
All single women
looking for Mr. Right.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.120
That doesn’t jibe
with a $20 hooker.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.600
No, it doesn't. Something must have
gone wrong last night.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.600
He was forced
to improvise.

18:12.680 --> 18:15.400
We're still talking about
a guy without a consistent M.O.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.440
Not necessarily.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.760
These are letters he E-mailed
to Lauren Mackalvey.

18:19.840 --> 18:23.480
They contain lines from a handful of
1 6th-century Italian poems.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.640
So he has a copy of
Bartlett's Quotations. So what?

18:26.680 --> 18:29.480
You won't find any of these
in Bartlett's.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.120
- I'm not sure I follow you.
- Look at this.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.280
Ginaselli's La Vita Nuova,
Castionni's Il Cortigiano,

18:35.360 --> 18:37.280
and a few others I won't
even try to pronounce.

18:37.360 --> 18:41.920
These are from obscure text from
privately-owned libraries that only lend
to academic affiliates.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.880
You're saying our-- our suspect's
a college professor?

18:44.960 --> 18:47.480
Or a graduate student,
a visiting fellow, maybe a translator.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.040
What we need to do is compile a list
of everybody in the Cleveland area...

18:50.080 --> 18:52.040
who has these kind
of credentials.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.040
- Can you do that?
- Yeah. I'll get right on it.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.080
Here's something else
that might help.

18:58.080 --> 19:01.720
The killer should have
an identifiable wound pattern from this.

her pound of flesh, huh?

can I take you to dinner somewhere?

- I'm busy. I have a deadline.

He creeps me out.

Okay.

21:16.680 --> 21:20.240
Blaine just gave me the list from the
university. How's it going over here?

21:20.320 --> 21:22.280
[Scully]Good.
We're just expanding the search...

21:22.360 --> 21:25.320
to include the faculty rosters
from the local community colleges.

21:25.360 --> 21:28.680

21:34.400 --> 21:36.320
We're almost done
with the list.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.320
That skin you found
under the prostitute's fingernails?

21:38.400 --> 21:41.840
I had the lab check the DNA results
against the known offenders database.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.840
And?

21:47.480 --> 21:49.440
Well, it says here
they didn't find a match.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.440
No, but they did
find something else.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.440
Check the next page
where it's circled.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.760
"The skin sample contains no oils
or essential fatty acid."

21:56.840 --> 21:59.320
There are any number of factors
which could have caused that result.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.360
Where are you going
with this?

22:01.400 --> 22:04.800
Okay, it's not yet the finely-detailed
insanity you’ve come to expect from me.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.160
It's just a theory,
but what if he's not doing this...

22:07.200 --> 22:10.480
out of a psychotic impulse but rather
out of some physical hunger?

22:10.600 --> 22:14.320
Maybe he needs to replenish
this chemical deficiency to survive.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.520
From a dry-skin sample,
you're concluding what?

22:16.600 --> 22:18.880
That he's some kind
of a fat-sucking vampire?

22:18.960 --> 22:21.280
I don't know how else to explain
Lauren Mackalvey's missing adipose.

22:21.360 --> 22:24.280
I bet if you check the Aberdeen victims,
you'd find exactly the same thing.

22:24.320 --> 22:27.720
This killer secretes a digestive
substance which renders the fat--

22:27.800 --> 22:31.280
Which he ingests before
the rest of the body dissolves entirely.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.280
There are examples
of this in nature, aren't there?

22:34.360 --> 22:37.800
Yeah, scorpions predigest
their food outside of their body...

22:37.880 --> 22:39.840
by regurgitating onto their prey.

But I don't know too many scorpions
who surf the internet.

22:43.440 --> 22:46.240
Okay, but if I'm right, then we're
not just looking for a serial murderer.

22:46.320 --> 22:49.040
We're looking for some kind
of genetically-different human being,

22:49.080 --> 22:51.880

Well, he made contact with each one
of his victims, right?

There's nothing to talk about. You made
it pretty clear what you wanted.
