00:03.805 --> 00:05.505
<i>Previously on </i> Stitchers...

00:05.506 --> 00:07.206
I found an old picture
that Ed left for me.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.441
He wrote the word "remember" on the back.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.210
Cameron: Remember what?

00:11.212 --> 00:13.412
You hooked up with Linus?

00:16.851 --> 00:18.417
The world needs more people like you.

00:18.636 --> 00:22.080
- Did you leak the code?
- I was having breakfast with Leslie Turner.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.960
He's the director of the agency.

00:23.961 --> 00:26.122
- Cameron: It has to be Marta.
- Maggie: Then find her.

00:27.094 --> 00:28.961
You're gonna be safe now.

00:28.963 --> 00:31.497
The Stitchers program
was created to help people.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.399
They turned us into grave robbers.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.968
What do I tell her when she asks
what our 8 billion dollar

00:35.970 --> 00:38.304
program is really designed to do?

00:38.306 --> 00:40.072
Whatever you want...

00:40.074 --> 00:41.373
As long as it's not the truth.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.942
- (sirens wailing)
- I have to protect you.

00:42.944 --> 00:44.310
I have to save you.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.412
Put the gun down!
Drop the gun!

00:53.165 --> 00:57.143
(Birds chirping)

01:45.105 --> 01:47.550
(Birds chirping)

01:50.356 --> 01:51.657
How are you doing?

01:53.462 --> 01:54.397
I'm doing.

01:55.666 --> 01:56.516
How about you?

01:56.796 --> 01:58.797
- Me?
- Yeah. How are you doing?

01:58.798 --> 02:01.066
It'd actually help me to know.

02:03.136 --> 02:07.573
Well, I wish Marta was still alive...

02:07.574 --> 02:10.475
So I can finish asking her

02:10.476 --> 02:12.244
about the things she told me.

02:12.245 --> 02:14.479
What'd she tell you?

02:14.480 --> 02:15.948
That I'm not safe,

02:15.949 --> 02:20.152
that the stitch cases we handle are
test runs for something bigger,

02:21.721 --> 02:25.057
and that I, and possibly
all of us, are being used.

02:25.058 --> 02:27.993
And if something goes wrong,

02:27.994 --> 02:29.428
we may be in danger.

02:29.429 --> 02:32.531
I'm pretty sure if Marta knew
the Stitchers program had

02:32.532 --> 02:34.833
some secret nefarious purpose,

02:34.834 --> 02:36.935
she would've found a way
to have left me a message for,

02:36.936 --> 02:38.804
you know, when she was gone.

02:42.008 --> 02:43.508
<i>Hi, Kirsten.</i>

02:43.509 --> 02:46.945
<i>I'm sorry that I had to leave you.</i>

02:46.946 --> 02:50.315
<i>But I want you to know that even though</i>

02:50.316 --> 02:53.185
<i>I'll be gone for a while,
I'm watching out for you.</i>

02:53.186 --> 02:58.056
- <i>So, tonight's story is</i> Sleeping Beauty...
- (Bed creaks)

02:59.225 --> 03:01.193
What are you doing in my bed?

03:01.194 --> 03:02.995
What are you doing with a Walkman?

03:02.996 --> 03:04.997
Listening to the tape you found
in Ed's cassette player.

03:04.998 --> 03:07.799
Can we bring this episode of
<i>Roommates Without Borders</i>

03:07.800 --> 03:09.768
- to an end now?
- (Tape continues playing)

03:10.803 --> 03:12.804
Why are you listening to that right now?

03:12.805 --> 03:15.641
It's something Cameron said
after Marta's funeral.

03:15.642 --> 03:17.376
(Sighs)

03:17.377 --> 03:19.478
<i>- Great rejoicing...
- Why are you still in my bed?</i>

03:19.479 --> 03:23.348
(Sighs) Okay. Because...

03:23.349 --> 03:26.518
I was wondering if maybe you
wanted to talk about your feelings

03:26.519 --> 03:28.320
about what happened to Marta.

03:28.321 --> 03:30.355
I'm good.

03:30.356 --> 03:33.325
Well, is it okay if I
talk about my feelings?

03:33.326 --> 03:34.593
I'm good.

03:34.594 --> 03:36.962
<i>- The spindle...
- Can you go back to your room now?</i>

03:36.963 --> 03:38.597
I'm good.

03:38.598 --> 03:40.732
(Beeping from earphones)

03:42.969 --> 03:44.736
Wait, what is that?

03:44.737 --> 03:46.338
(Beeping continues)

03:51.377 --> 03:54.312
It's the same sequence
of turns over and over.

03:54.313 --> 03:56.381
Like some kind of message.

04:02.088 --> 04:03.421
(Theme music plays)

04:06.993 --> 04:11.196
<i>♪ Take me inside ♪</i>

04:12.832 --> 04:15.804
<i>♪ take me inside ♪</i>

04:16.204 --> 04:19.805
1x06 - <i>Finally</i>

04:26.746 --> 04:28.513
Is there a problem?

04:28.514 --> 04:31.349
No. I'm just having a hard
time understanding something.

04:31.350 --> 04:33.485
You've come to Dr. Linus for advice.

04:33.486 --> 04:35.721
- Well, I'm flattered.
- Cameron is busy.

04:35.722 --> 04:37.989
- Oh.
- Ed Clark left this for me.

04:37.990 --> 04:39.291
It has a sequence of tones on it.

04:39.292 --> 04:41.026
Do you think you could try
and decipher them for me?

04:41.027 --> 04:45.163
"Do or do not. There is no try."

04:46.199 --> 04:48.700
- Yoda.
- Okay,

04:48.701 --> 04:50.836
- I think I'm gonna see if Cameron is free...
- No, no, no, no.

04:50.837 --> 04:52.437
- I can do it.
- You sure?

04:52.438 --> 04:56.341
I have a close working relationship
with our quantum computer.

04:56.342 --> 04:59.244
What I don't have, though,
is a cassette player.

04:59.245 --> 05:01.446
(Alarm ringing)

05:01.447 --> 05:03.782
Now you do.

05:04.851 --> 05:07.185
Before we get started
I want to say something.

05:07.186 --> 05:09.788
In this lab we deal
with death all the time,

05:09.789 --> 05:12.791
but when it hits this close to home,

05:12.792 --> 05:16.027
death can leave us
with a lot of questions.

05:16.028 --> 05:19.464
Now, I know we're all a bit raw
after what happened with Marta,

05:19.465 --> 05:25.337
so I promise you that our search
for answers will continue,

05:25.338 --> 05:27.873
but right now we have a job to do.

05:27.874 --> 05:30.041
Camille.

05:30.042 --> 05:33.178
Dani Fox, 26. She was a researcher

05:33.179 --> 05:36.381
for a privately funded medical study
ran by a Dr. Sebastian Zuber.

05:36.382 --> 05:38.884
It's a promising new treatment
in traumatic brain injury.

05:38.885 --> 05:41.520
Dani apparently lost control of her car

05:41.521 --> 05:43.755
and slammed into a concrete wall.

05:43.756 --> 05:45.290
Car is only a few weeks old.

05:45.291 --> 05:47.192
There's no evidence of a
mechanical malfunction.

05:47.193 --> 05:48.960
Maybe she had a stroke or a heart attack.

05:48.961 --> 05:51.963
Or it could've been
suicide by acceleration.

05:51.964 --> 05:53.899
So we investigate car crashes now?

05:53.900 --> 05:56.401
As with all things, we do as we're told.

06:02.341 --> 06:04.609
Cameron: Dani Fox is loaded in.

06:04.610 --> 06:06.912
Stations, everyone.

06:06.913 --> 06:09.748
Any luck with the tones?

06:09.749 --> 06:12.017
Even Yoda can't deliver that fast.

06:13.553 --> 06:16.721
Okay Stretch, fish tank
is a toasty 98 degrees.

06:16.722 --> 06:19.524
- Time for a dip.
- Can't wait.

06:19.525 --> 06:21.960
Cameron: Let's dim the lights
for a little atmosphere.

06:21.961 --> 06:24.596
Okay. I need a go, no-go
for stitch neurosync.

06:24.597 --> 06:26.097
- Life-Sci?
- We are a go.

06:26.098 --> 06:27.332
- Sub-Bio?
- Go.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.567
- Engineering?
- Go.

06:28.568 --> 06:30.302
- Communications?
- We are good to go.

06:30.303 --> 06:33.004
- Medical?
- Her vitals are good. Go.

06:33.005 --> 06:36.241
Okay Penny Priddy, remember,
wherever you go, there you are.

06:36.242 --> 06:37.909
What does that even mean?

06:37.910 --> 06:39.277
Don't be a buzzkill.

06:39.278 --> 06:41.379
Initiate stitch neurosync on my mark.

06:41.380 --> 06:45.450
Three, two, one... mark.

06:45.451 --> 06:47.485
(Beeping)

06:49.722 --> 06:51.590
Cameron: <i>Where are ya?</i>

06:51.591 --> 06:53.225
Downtown L.A.

06:53.226 --> 06:55.927
Dani just wrote a check to some woman.

06:55.928 --> 06:57.796
You won't be sorry.

06:57.797 --> 06:59.664
And don't worry, your
secret is safe with me.

06:59.665 --> 07:01.865
Whatever it's for, she
doesn't want anyone to know.

07:04.403 --> 07:06.738
Okay, I'm in some sort of room...

07:06.739 --> 07:10.876
Um... could be a spa

07:10.877 --> 07:13.645
or a... a dentist office.

07:13.646 --> 07:15.280
Maybe it's where Dani worked.

07:15.281 --> 07:16.715
Wha... why a spa?

07:16.716 --> 07:19.084
Because there's a chair here

07:19.085 --> 07:23.955
with some kind of
electronic halo over it.

07:26.392 --> 07:28.860
All done, Jane. Relax.

07:28.861 --> 07:31.196
Uh... they just finished it.

07:31.197 --> 07:33.431
A treatment... uh, Dani and Dr. Zuber.

07:33.432 --> 07:35.400
There's some improvement
in her neural patterns.

07:35.401 --> 07:37.802
But not what we hoped.

07:41.107 --> 07:42.574
Hey.

07:43.376 --> 07:45.110
You did great.

07:45.111 --> 07:47.646
The treatment went very well.

07:47.647 --> 07:50.482
Zuber really cares for his patients.

07:53.019 --> 07:54.619
I'm in Dani's house.

07:56.022 --> 07:57.355
She has a roommate.

07:57.356 --> 07:58.723
On it.

08:00.293 --> 08:02.393
Why do you always do that?

08:03.362 --> 08:06.464
- Do what?
- Hide whatever you're working on.

08:06.465 --> 08:07.945
I wouldn't understand it anyway.

08:09.335 --> 08:11.369
I'm sorry.

08:11.370 --> 08:12.971
Whatever.

08:12.972 --> 08:15.307
Camille: Dani's roommate is her sister.

08:15.308 --> 08:17.408
Nicole Fox, 24.

08:19.512 --> 08:21.546
Kirsten: I don't think
they get along too well.

08:21.547 --> 08:22.580
Why not?

08:22.581 --> 08:24.182
Because whatever is on Dani's laptop,

08:24.183 --> 08:25.617
she doesn't want Nicole to see.

08:25.618 --> 08:28.653
Did you move me?
I'm back at the institute.

08:28.654 --> 08:31.423
I didn't do a thing.
Memories must be pulling you.

08:31.424 --> 08:33.625
Focus, George! We have a problem.

08:33.626 --> 08:35.327
No, you have a problem.

08:35.328 --> 08:36.561
She's arguing with a colleague.

08:36.562 --> 08:38.730
The results are incremental at best.

08:38.731 --> 08:40.432
Maybe you're expecting too much.

08:40.433 --> 08:42.000
Dani: We need more test subjects.

08:42.001 --> 08:44.001
The grant committee needs
to see real progress

08:44.003 --> 08:45.770
or we'll never make it to phase two.

08:45.771 --> 08:48.139
I am being pulled all over the place.

08:48.140 --> 08:49.541
Do you understand what's going on here?

08:49.542 --> 08:52.377
Calm down, Dani.

08:52.378 --> 08:54.412
You were right to stay the course.

08:54.413 --> 08:56.448
- Where are you now?
- In the lobby.

08:56.449 --> 08:58.450
Kirsten: Dani is with Sebastian Zuber.
She's very upset.

08:58.451 --> 09:01.219
L... look, there's great
improvements across the board.

09:01.220 --> 09:03.989
This study must be Dani's most
emotionally charged memory.

09:03.990 --> 09:07.225
Wow. I guess I
underestimated our success.

09:07.226 --> 09:09.360
These are amazing.

09:11.530 --> 09:13.898
I'm with Dani in her car now...

09:15.267 --> 09:16.935
(Beeping, steering wheel locks)

09:16.936 --> 09:19.637
...which is acting really weird.

09:19.638 --> 09:22.340
(Car beeps and accelerates)

09:25.044 --> 09:26.444
(Screams)

09:29.482 --> 09:32.317
It wasn't her fault.
She couldn't control the car.

09:32.318 --> 09:34.919
It had a catastrophic
failure of some kind.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.088
That's odd for a new car.

09:37.089 --> 09:39.190
Then let's ask it what happened.

09:41.761 --> 09:45.363
The computers in the newer cars are
like the black boxes on planes.

09:45.364 --> 09:47.265
They can tell exactly what
caused the malfunction.

09:47.266 --> 09:49.567
You know an awful lot about cars.

09:49.568 --> 09:52.470
Well, I spent my weekends in high school

09:52.471 --> 09:53.605
working at an auto shop.

09:53.606 --> 09:55.940
I bussed tables at my
uncle's restaurant.

09:55.941 --> 09:57.308
- I studied.
- I also studied.

09:57.309 --> 09:58.843
Adorable.

09:58.844 --> 09:59.878
(Computer buzzing)

09:59.879 --> 10:01.079
Whoa.

10:03.349 --> 10:04.582
What happened?

10:04.583 --> 10:06.284
Someone remotely hacked
into the car's computer

10:06.285 --> 10:07.352
and took control of it.

10:07.353 --> 10:10.088
So Dani's crash wasn't an accident.

10:19.691 --> 10:23.754
Dani Fox and Sebastian Zuber
got a $4 million grant

10:23.755 --> 10:26.524
from the Lanwell Foundation.

10:26.525 --> 10:28.125
Do you like eating out of a carton?

10:28.126 --> 10:30.661
'Cause you know, I got you a plate.

10:30.662 --> 10:32.797
Food tastes the same either way.

10:32.798 --> 10:37.067
Their hypothesis is that deep
trans-cranial magnetic stimulation

10:37.068 --> 10:39.303
can speed up recovery
from brain injuries.

10:39.304 --> 10:41.271
That is why you need a plate.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.942
Kirsten: That's what I saw in their lab.
They built it themselves.

10:44.943 --> 10:46.443
You know, we should
go talk to Dani's sister,

10:46.444 --> 10:47.611
see if she knows anything about it.

10:47.612 --> 10:49.847
Y... you might want
to wipe off your shirt

10:49.848 --> 10:51.408
before your dinner leaves a stain.

10:52.951 --> 10:54.618
You could've told me sooner.

10:54.619 --> 10:56.153
(Scoffs)

10:56.154 --> 10:59.190
Now it's time to play
<i>how is this my fault?</i>

10:59.191 --> 11:00.624
(Knocking)

11:01.960 --> 11:03.394
Come in.

11:06.198 --> 11:08.432
Oh hey, Janice...

11:08.433 --> 11:09.800
Oh! What was that for?

11:09.801 --> 11:11.669
Lying about getting me groceries.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.037
You knew it was that poor guy

11:13.038 --> 11:14.371
from downstairs who got shot.

11:14.372 --> 11:15.472
Yeah... I'm sorry. I was... I was

11:15.473 --> 11:17.074
trying to tell you, but I
didn't get the chance.

11:17.075 --> 11:18.676
Really? Really?

11:18.677 --> 11:19.710
But you're right.

11:19.711 --> 11:21.579
I should've made it more
clear that it wasn't me.

11:21.580 --> 11:24.315
I suppose that also wasn't you
spying on me from your window?

11:24.316 --> 11:25.616
Actually, that was someone else, too.

11:25.617 --> 11:27.451
I hope you feel good
knowing you freeloaded

11:27.452 --> 11:29.186
off a good man's good deed.

11:29.187 --> 11:30.654
Very nice...

11:32.524 --> 11:34.191
Oh! I'm Cameron.

11:34.192 --> 11:36.927
Cameron. And to think
I almost slept with you.

11:36.928 --> 11:38.195
But...

11:40.065 --> 11:43.033
Wait... was that... did she just?

11:43.034 --> 11:45.302
Twice.

11:45.303 --> 11:47.371
- (Linus and Camille gasp)
- Find out anything?

11:47.372 --> 11:48.973
Yeah. You can take a hit.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.008
- You know what I mean.
- Okay. Yes.

11:51.009 --> 11:53.344
It's surprisingly easy to
hack into a car's computer.

11:53.345 --> 11:55.512
All you have to do is hook up a
small receiver to the system.

11:55.513 --> 11:56.680
It can be controlled from anywhere.

11:56.681 --> 11:58.482
- Seriously?
- Linus and Camille: Mm-hmm.

11:58.483 --> 12:00.251
Um, hello.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.585
Hello.

12:01.586 --> 12:04.288
- You going somewhere?
- To talk to Dani's sister.

12:04.289 --> 12:06.790
- You coming?
- Make yourselves at home.

12:06.791 --> 12:08.258
Stay out of the bedroom.

12:10.495 --> 12:12.596
Cameron: I'm so sorry to
hear about your sister.

12:12.597 --> 12:14.665
We came by to pay our respects.

12:14.666 --> 12:15.900
I appreciate that.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.034
How did you know Dani?

12:17.035 --> 12:18.802
Through her work at the institute.

12:21.773 --> 12:23.107
Sorry about the mess.

12:23.108 --> 12:25.509
I haven't had a chance to
clean up since the accident.

12:27.612 --> 12:28.913
That's right... you're a baker.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.248
- Dani told me.
- Really?

12:31.249 --> 12:33.017
I didn't think Dani cared.

12:33.018 --> 12:34.184
I'm sure she did.

12:34.185 --> 12:36.053
It's nice of you to come.

12:36.054 --> 12:37.488
Dani didn't have any friends.

12:37.489 --> 12:39.156
She was so devoted to her research.

12:39.157 --> 12:40.658
With Dr. Zuber?

12:40.659 --> 12:42.626
She was psyched to be working with him.

12:42.627 --> 12:44.728
Health study was her passion,

12:44.729 --> 12:46.330
even though it totally stressed her out.

12:46.331 --> 12:48.399
It seemed like things got pretty intense

12:48.400 --> 12:52.136
the past month, but she would
never talk to me about it.

12:52.137 --> 12:54.738
She probably didn't think I'd understand.

12:54.739 --> 12:56.840
Dani was the brain in the family.

12:56.841 --> 12:58.842
I'm just the kid sister
with the silly hobby.

12:58.843 --> 13:02.046
You know, I thought she seemed
kind of troubled too, recently.

13:02.047 --> 13:03.614
Do you think it was just about work?

13:03.615 --> 13:05.983
Dani was only about work.

13:05.984 --> 13:07.784
She lived for it.

13:14.225 --> 13:15.859
This place is nice.

13:15.860 --> 13:20.631
I mean, you know, no
stitch lab but still.

13:20.632 --> 13:22.633
Dani really lived for her work.

13:22.634 --> 13:24.668
Maybe too much... I really felt that.

13:24.669 --> 13:26.837
Stitcher, heal thyself.

13:26.838 --> 13:29.506
I saw him in Dani's memory.

13:31.476 --> 13:32.943
Uh, excuse me,

13:32.944 --> 13:34.678
do you know where
we could find Dani Fox?

13:34.679 --> 13:36.480
Why are you looking for Dani?

13:36.481 --> 13:39.783
Well, we... we were supposed to meet
her for lunch with Sebastian Zuber.

13:39.784 --> 13:42.319
You haven't heard.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.887
Heard?

13:43.888 --> 13:47.091
Dani... she died in a
car crash last night.

13:47.092 --> 13:50.361
Oh... yeah, no. We had no idea.

13:50.362 --> 13:52.462
Do you think we could
speak with Dr. Zuber?

13:53.365 --> 13:55.799
Dr. Zuber isn't coming in today.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.535
Police wanted to talk to him about Dani.

13:58.536 --> 14:00.738
Call next week.

14:00.739 --> 14:04.808
I'm sure you can understand he needs
time to process this tragedy.

14:16.154 --> 14:19.556
I think George lied to us. That's Zuber.

14:19.557 --> 14:21.025
- Dr. Zuber...
- Please not now.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.260
I'm so sorry about Dani.

14:25.797 --> 14:28.298
- You knew Dani?
- Yes.

14:28.299 --> 14:31.035
She said she could help me.

14:31.036 --> 14:34.004
- Help you?
- With my brain.

14:45.227 --> 14:48.239
Looks like a dentist chair on steroids.

14:48.465 --> 14:49.682
I hate going to the dentist.

14:49.683 --> 14:51.984
- Sorry, I didn't catch that?
- Oh. I was just admiring...

14:51.985 --> 14:54.654
Oh, the transcranial
magnetic stimulator.

14:54.655 --> 14:56.288
Dr. Zuber: Please, please.

14:57.391 --> 15:00.426
Dani... Dani was the life
force of this project.

15:00.427 --> 15:01.861
How long did you know her?

15:01.862 --> 15:03.196
I just met her last weekend.

15:03.197 --> 15:04.997
Yeah, she wanted to help everybody,

15:04.998 --> 15:06.933
but maybe I can help you now.

15:06.934 --> 15:09.035
Uh, George... So why don't you start

15:09.036 --> 15:11.270
by just telling me a
little bit about yourself.

15:11.271 --> 15:13.172
- George will take notes.
- (Kirsten sighs)

15:13.173 --> 15:15.074
Where should I start?

15:15.075 --> 15:17.076
When... when did the injury occur?

15:17.077 --> 15:19.445
About 15 years ago when I was eight.

15:19.446 --> 15:21.314
My mother and I were in a car accident.

15:21.315 --> 15:22.515
And what happened to your mother?

15:22.516 --> 15:24.450
She died in the crash.

15:24.451 --> 15:26.319
Dr. Zuber: I'm really
sorry to hear that.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.688
And how does the injury affect you now?

15:28.689 --> 15:30.890
Memory loss. I don't remember anything

15:30.891 --> 15:32.124
from before I was eight.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.526
All right then.

15:33.527 --> 15:35.795
Do you have any problems
making new memories?

15:35.796 --> 15:38.264
No, no. Not... not that I can think of.

15:38.265 --> 15:40.099
Are these questions
absolutely necessary?

15:40.100 --> 15:41.634
I need her to tell me whatever she can.

15:41.635 --> 15:42.802
Dr. Zuber is right.

15:42.803 --> 15:45.137
I have been told that I have no filter

15:45.138 --> 15:47.907
and that I am not great
at expressing emotions.

15:47.908 --> 15:49.842
Well, you are her friend. Is that true?

15:49.843 --> 15:51.811
Cameron: Pretty much.

15:53.347 --> 15:55.948
Well, my treatment is
still in the trial phase,

15:55.949 --> 15:58.651
but Dani believed we were
right on the verge of success.

15:58.652 --> 16:00.186
Are you open for a session?

16:00.187 --> 16:01.921
Absolutely.

16:01.922 --> 16:04.323
Thank you, Dr. Zuber.

16:04.324 --> 16:06.259
Please, you're a friend
of Dani's... call me Sebastian.

16:06.260 --> 16:09.495
Hey George, could we please
set up a time for tomorrow?

16:16.503 --> 16:17.870
(Ding)

16:19.506 --> 16:21.941
Huh. I see you got my message.

16:21.942 --> 16:24.010
Yeah. And in the history of bad ideas,

16:24.011 --> 16:26.312
this ranks just above
the $2 bill and jeggings.

16:26.313 --> 16:28.347
We need access to Dani's life.

16:28.348 --> 16:31.150
Most of it was in that lab and in
her office... it's my only way in.

16:31.151 --> 16:34.654
But when the good doc figures out that
you're faking a brain injury, then what?

16:34.655 --> 16:36.989
He won't. Before she died,

16:36.990 --> 16:39.258
Dani confronted Zuber... there was
something wrong with the study.

16:39.259 --> 16:40.793
Something worth killing her for.

16:40.794 --> 16:42.595
The only way to find out
what's going on in that lab

16:42.596 --> 16:43.896
is a private session with Zuber,

16:43.897 --> 16:45.364
unless anyone has any better ideas.

16:45.365 --> 16:48.000
Fine. I will allow it...

16:48.001 --> 16:50.402
Under one condition.

16:53.774 --> 16:55.841
Linus: Did you guys see the death stare

16:55.842 --> 16:59.178
that Kirsten gave Maggie when she
told her she had to wear a wire?

16:59.179 --> 17:00.947
And Maggie was just looking out for her.

17:00.948 --> 17:02.348
Okay. By hearing what's
going on in there,

17:02.349 --> 17:04.050
we'll be able to know
if Kirsten is in trouble.

17:04.050 --> 17:06.986
The agency really outdid itself.

17:06.987 --> 17:09.789
We've got a backscatter X-ray infotech,

17:09.790 --> 17:11.824
an infrared vibration receiver,

17:11.825 --> 17:13.759
oh, and this baby here...

17:13.760 --> 17:15.694
...it's called a blowfish.

17:15.695 --> 17:17.195
Linus: It acts like a cell phone tower.

17:17.196 --> 17:19.498
Pinpoint the location of any
phone that tries to ping it.

17:19.499 --> 17:20.633
Okay. Can you stop playing around?

17:20.634 --> 17:22.068
Camille: Too bad you
didn't have all this

17:22.069 --> 17:24.069
- when you were spying on Janice.
- Oh!

17:24.070 --> 17:25.771
- (Scoffs)
- Too soon?

17:27.074 --> 17:28.174
Kirsten: <i>Test one...</i>

17:28.175 --> 17:30.076
We got ears, everybody.

17:30.077 --> 17:31.110
I hope you guys can hear me.

17:31.111 --> 17:33.245
This thing really itches.

17:33.246 --> 17:35.748
I'm sorry for keeping
you waiting, Ms. Clark.

17:35.749 --> 17:38.084
Um, you've met my research
assistant, George Adler.

17:38.085 --> 17:39.518
- Yes.
- I'll be taking notes

17:39.519 --> 17:41.253
as Dr. Zuber does the evaluation.

17:41.254 --> 17:42.888
Uh... evaluation?

17:42.889 --> 17:44.423
It's something we use to see

17:44.424 --> 17:46.359
if you're a potential
candidate for the program.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.427
Did Dani help you build that?

17:48.428 --> 17:49.929
Yes, she did.

17:49.930 --> 17:52.064
Now, Ms. Clark, tell me about

17:52.065 --> 17:53.899
the car accident you had
when you were eight.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.669
I don't remember the accident
or anything before the accident.

17:56.670 --> 17:58.971
Well, tell me about the earliest
memories you do recall.

17:58.972 --> 18:01.140
She doesn't remember anything
before the age of eight?

18:01.141 --> 18:02.975
- Shh!
- <i>Waking up and being</i>

18:02.976 --> 18:05.244
told that my mother was dead...

18:05.245 --> 18:07.980
And feeling nothing, because
I didn't know who she was.

18:07.981 --> 18:10.182
Dr. Zuber: You don't
remember your mother?

18:10.183 --> 18:12.218
<i>What about your father?</i>

18:12.219 --> 18:13.719
I remember him dropping me off

18:13.720 --> 18:16.389
with his friend Ed and
never coming back for me.

18:16.390 --> 18:17.990
How long did you and
Dani work together for?

18:17.991 --> 18:21.160
You seem very focused on Dani's work.

18:21.161 --> 18:23.396
Well, I... I find what
you do fascinating.

18:23.397 --> 18:25.164
Or maybe talking about Dani is a way

18:25.165 --> 18:26.599
of avoiding your own pain.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.701
I'm not really in any pain.

18:28.702 --> 18:30.136
Are you sure?

18:30.137 --> 18:31.837
I mean, it couldn't have
been easy as a child.

18:31.838 --> 18:32.938
Of course not. It sucked.

18:32.939 --> 18:35.608
And not being able to express
or access my emotions

18:35.609 --> 18:37.743
<i>and always feeling
alone and out of sync,</i>

18:37.744 --> 18:40.012
not to mention getting
lost doing simple things

18:40.013 --> 18:41.847
like homework or brushing my teeth.

18:41.848 --> 18:43.949
Did you and Dani share
responsibility for all the work?

18:43.950 --> 18:46.118
Yes, we did. But please,
let's stay on topic.

18:46.119 --> 18:47.153
I'm sorry.

18:47.154 --> 18:49.722
This is kind of part of
the no... no filter thing.

18:49.723 --> 18:52.625
Well, can you tell me how you've
coped with your condition?

18:52.626 --> 18:54.994
I have had excellent
doctors and therapists,

18:54.995 --> 18:58.731
and Ed devised tricks to help me
function as an independent person.

18:58.732 --> 19:00.966
I mean, I still have
trouble comprehending

19:00.967 --> 19:04.737
emotional and social cues, but I...
I think I'm getting better at it.

19:05.605 --> 19:07.740
You know, I owe Ed so much.

19:07.741 --> 19:09.508
I loved him like a father.

19:09.509 --> 19:11.177
Dr. Zuber: <i>Well, it's
important for people like you</i>

19:11.178 --> 19:12.712
<i>to have a good support
system of friends.</i>

19:12.713 --> 19:15.147
And tell me about the young man
who was with you here yesterday.

19:15.148 --> 19:16.782
Oh, Cameron?

19:16.783 --> 19:18.250
Dr. Zuber: <i>Is he your boyfriend?</i>

19:18.251 --> 19:20.286
Oh, no. No. He... he's nobody.

19:22.789 --> 19:24.857
Well, you're a very
interesting case, Ms. Clark.

19:24.858 --> 19:27.426
Now if... if you're up for it,
I'd like to begin some initial

19:27.427 --> 19:28.627
<i>treatments with you today.</i>

19:28.628 --> 19:30.262
No! What? No! No way!

19:30.263 --> 19:32.198
Yeah! Let's do it.

19:32.199 --> 19:33.365
Did she just say yes?

19:33.366 --> 19:34.500
Dr. Zuber: <i>Great!</i>

19:34.501 --> 19:36.381
Well, let me show you
how this thing works.

19:38.472 --> 19:40.172
Kirsten: Will I feel anything?

19:40.173 --> 19:42.841
You won't feel a thing. It's
perfectly safe and painless.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.817
How are we feeling, Ms. Clark?

19:50.843 --> 19:53.321
(sighs) A little nervous Dr. Zuber.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.537
Oh, it's okay. Just take a deep breath

19:55.538 --> 19:56.838
and try and relax.

19:56.839 --> 19:58.840
I'm going to be stimulating
parts of your brain

19:58.841 --> 20:00.208
which make and store memories.

20:00.209 --> 20:03.011
You may feel emotions
and experience memories

20:03.012 --> 20:04.613
you haven't in a long time.

20:04.614 --> 20:06.982
Whatever it takes to get better.

20:06.983 --> 20:08.150
You ready to start?

20:08.151 --> 20:09.651
Yeah.

20:09.652 --> 20:11.186
(Machine whirring)

20:18.594 --> 20:20.328
Kirsten: <i>I feel a buzzing.</i>

20:20.329 --> 20:21.797
Okay, we should stop her.

20:21.798 --> 20:24.099
Don't worry. I gave Kirsten a safe word.

20:24.934 --> 20:26.001
"Help."

20:26.002 --> 20:28.103
Oh, perfect. They won't
know what she means.

20:28.104 --> 20:29.638
Are you re-remembering something?

20:29.639 --> 20:31.840
The car accident.

20:31.841 --> 20:35.010
It was so loud. It's like an explosion.

20:35.011 --> 20:38.080
And windows all shattered and...

20:38.081 --> 20:40.315
Suddenly we're upside down.

20:40.316 --> 20:43.718
You're re-experiencing post
emotional and physical trauma.

20:43.719 --> 20:45.854
Is there anything else about the crash?

20:45.855 --> 20:49.224
My head pounding.

20:49.225 --> 20:51.359
Broken glass all over me.

20:53.463 --> 20:56.498
My mom unconscious.

20:56.499 --> 20:58.700
Blood on her face.

20:58.701 --> 21:02.237
Wait... now there's nothing.

21:02.238 --> 21:04.406
No.

21:04.407 --> 21:06.941
- How about now?
- (Machine whirring)

21:08.411 --> 21:09.878
No.

21:11.714 --> 21:13.648
Wait...

21:15.885 --> 21:17.919
My guardian Ed said my father promised

21:17.920 --> 21:19.688
to come back for me, but he never did.

21:19.689 --> 21:21.223
Is that all?

21:21.224 --> 21:23.125
Kirsten: <i>No.</i>

21:23.126 --> 21:25.260
<i>He drank all the time.</i>

21:25.261 --> 21:26.962
Yelled at me every day

21:26.963 --> 21:29.664
about being stuck with me, hating me.

21:32.235 --> 21:34.469
Maybe that's why he
abandoned me with Ed.

21:34.470 --> 21:36.738
Okay. Keep... keep going if you can.

21:36.739 --> 21:39.674
I know this is painful,
but it'll help you heal.

21:39.675 --> 21:42.344
She drank before the accident.

21:42.345 --> 21:44.412
I... I think she crashed
the car on purpose.

21:45.548 --> 21:47.382
- That's horrible.
- Did you know any of this?

21:47.383 --> 21:49.751
I... I mean, I knew about the accident.

21:49.752 --> 21:51.720
I didn't know about her parents.

21:51.721 --> 21:54.756
I don't think I can do this anymore.

21:54.757 --> 21:58.260
O... okay, Kirsten, I'm
just dialing it down.

21:58.261 --> 22:00.996
Dr. Zuber: Okay. Here. Yeah.
Take a deep breath.

22:00.997 --> 22:02.464
Take a deep breath.

22:02.465 --> 22:05.233
- (Exhales)
- Okay.

22:06.569 --> 22:08.503
- How do you feel?
- (Exhales)

22:10.006 --> 22:11.273
I...

22:11.274 --> 22:13.274
I think a little better.

22:14.911 --> 22:16.711
Does it always work this fast?

22:16.712 --> 22:19.748
Well, to be honest, you've responded
quicker than any other subject.

22:19.749 --> 22:21.650
Wh... what does that mean?

22:21.651 --> 22:23.551
You're a very special person.

22:27.089 --> 22:28.623
Kirsten, I'm so sorry.

22:28.624 --> 22:30.158
- About what?
- We had no idea...

22:30.159 --> 22:31.927
all that stuff about your parents and Ed.

22:31.928 --> 22:33.728
Listen, I know it might
be too soon to talk...

22:33.729 --> 22:34.896
- Guys...
- But if you ever need

22:34.897 --> 22:36.898
to share your thoughts with
someone, we're here for you.

22:36.899 --> 22:38.179
Guys, I made most of it up.

22:39.468 --> 22:41.369
You said the car accident was true.

22:41.370 --> 22:43.572
Yeah, well that is,
and that my father left

22:43.573 --> 22:44.739
me with Ed and never came back.

22:44.740 --> 22:46.441
But not the stuff about my parents

22:46.442 --> 22:48.009
drinking or yelling at me.

22:48.010 --> 22:50.946
You lying minx! I can't believe
I almost cried for you.

22:50.947 --> 22:52.547
- Wait, almost?
- Hey.

22:52.548 --> 22:53.682
Easy! She had you going, too.

22:53.683 --> 22:56.218
Okay, well the important
thing is she hooked Sebastian.

22:56.219 --> 22:58.820
Yeah. He said that I responded faster
than any of his other subjects.

22:58.821 --> 23:00.355
I mean, he didn't even
question it. Would you?

23:00.356 --> 23:02.257
I mean, an anomaly in a research study?

23:02.258 --> 23:04.559
- In a heartbeat.
- He wants to believe it worked.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.294
Okay, well, what does this
have to do with Dani?

23:06.295 --> 23:09.497
Kirsten: Well in the stitch, I saw Dani
trying to tell Sebastian something.

23:09.498 --> 23:11.066
And whatever it was, he
didn't want to hear it.

23:11.067 --> 23:15.470
I think she was trying to tell him
that their device doesn't work.

23:15.471 --> 23:17.806
You were supposed to just talk to him.

23:17.807 --> 23:19.441
Not left him run a current
through your head!

23:19.442 --> 23:21.810
Well, I'm glad I did, because
now I know he's a liar.

23:21.811 --> 23:24.079
He could've turned your brain to mush.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.815
Zuber has millions of
dollars in grant money

23:26.816 --> 23:28.116
and his reputation at stake.

23:28.117 --> 23:30.151
If he doesn't get results,
he'll lose his funding.

23:30.152 --> 23:31.953
And if he turned up the juice too high,

23:31.954 --> 23:34.022
- we could have lost you.
- Oh yes. I get it,

23:34.023 --> 23:36.724
Maggie... I am a precious
government asset.

23:38.894 --> 23:41.363
I am not as soulless as you think.

23:41.364 --> 23:42.998
I am here to look after you,

23:42.999 --> 23:45.300
which includes stopping you
from taking dangerous,

23:45.301 --> 23:48.069
unnecessary, and quite
frankly, stupid risks.

23:48.070 --> 23:49.571
Oh, you want to play mother, huh?

23:49.572 --> 23:52.340
Fine. Why don't you let me
in on a little family secret?

23:52.341 --> 23:54.242
What's the real purpose
of the Stitchers program?

23:54.243 --> 23:55.644
(Sighs)

23:55.645 --> 23:58.280
I suggest you take whatever Marta
said to you with a grain of salt.

23:58.281 --> 24:01.383
Marta is looking a lot like
Dani Fox to me right now...

24:01.384 --> 24:06.120
a bright, driven young woman who questioned
her superiors and wound up dead.

24:08.591 --> 24:11.326
Which is not how you treat family.

24:23.539 --> 24:25.673
Les Turner, please.

24:33.516 --> 24:35.116
So Maggie tore you a new one, huh?

24:35.117 --> 24:37.285
Yeah. She stonewalled me,

24:37.286 --> 24:38.720
just like Sebastian stonewalled Dani.

24:38.721 --> 24:41.256
I mean, if we're gonna solve murders,
we're gonna have to take risks.

24:41.257 --> 24:42.691
Speaking of risks,

24:42.692 --> 24:44.726
your pal Sebastian has
been taking a few himself.

24:44.727 --> 24:46.561
- What do you mean?
- This is his most recent

24:46.562 --> 24:48.296
published study... everything checks out.

24:48.297 --> 24:50.598
The statistics, the data,
the proper allowance

24:50.599 --> 24:52.967
for the Hawthorne Effect,
I mean, the research is perfect.

24:52.968 --> 24:55.370
- So what's the problem?
- It's too perfect.

24:55.371 --> 24:57.806
The whole thing reads like a
carefully orchestrated document

24:57.807 --> 24:59.407
aimed at soliciting grant money.

24:59.408 --> 25:02.777
Which means you may be right
about him faking his results.

25:02.778 --> 25:05.313
Well, hopefully I'll get
proof of that tonight.

25:05.314 --> 25:07.248
How? We don't have access
to Dani's work computer.

25:07.249 --> 25:10.318
And that's why we have to go
back to Zuber's facility.

25:10.319 --> 25:11.920
You swiped that from the stitch lab?

25:11.921 --> 25:14.289
Borrowed. To get me in.

25:14.290 --> 25:16.925
It's too dangerous.

25:16.926 --> 25:20.795
Which is why you will all be in
the van outside the institute.

25:20.796 --> 25:22.430
(Knocking)

25:23.566 --> 25:25.166
(Knocking continues)

25:29.739 --> 25:31.406
You're not gonna hit me again, are ya?

25:31.407 --> 25:33.308
I came to apologize.

25:33.309 --> 25:35.477
Look, I'm sorry I called you a liar.

25:35.478 --> 25:38.446
This whole thing with
your neighbor is really

25:38.447 --> 25:43.852
upsetting and... What do you
say you and I start fresh?

25:43.853 --> 25:46.154
You know, like a do-over.

25:47.590 --> 25:51.092
Okay. Yeah. That sounds great.

25:54.029 --> 25:55.864
Aren't you going to invite me in or...

25:55.865 --> 25:58.466
So are we going out or not?

25:59.502 --> 26:00.935
(Clears throat)

26:00.936 --> 26:03.371
I didn't know you had company.

26:03.372 --> 26:05.573
- Who is she?
- Her?

26:05.574 --> 26:07.208
She's nobody.

26:18.745 --> 26:22.345
Kirsten, remember,
security guard's name is Wes.

26:27.543 --> 26:29.110
Hi, Wes.

26:32.681 --> 26:33.715
I'm in.

26:33.716 --> 26:35.917
- All right. She's in.
- Yes. We all heard her.

26:35.918 --> 26:37.285
I'm just saying.

26:47.764 --> 26:48.964
(Buzzing)

26:50.133 --> 26:51.867
I can't get in to Sebastian's office.

26:51.868 --> 26:53.168
Trying Dani's next.

26:53.169 --> 26:54.536
(Sighs) Okay.

26:54.537 --> 26:56.371
- (Buzzing)
- I'm going in.

26:56.372 --> 26:58.974
(Siren wails)

26:58.975 --> 27:01.810
Uh, we got company. 5-0 is in the house.

27:01.811 --> 27:03.578
Cameron: Oh great.

27:03.579 --> 27:05.280
(Clamoring)

27:13.156 --> 27:15.857
Uh, honey? Honey? Yeah, um...

27:15.858 --> 27:19.427
I... I gotta go. Okay. Um...

27:19.428 --> 27:20.929
Evening, Officer.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.397
Can I... can I help ya?

27:22.398 --> 27:26.501
You sure can... by obeying the
sign and moving your vehicle.

27:26.502 --> 27:28.837
(Laughs) Would you look at that?

27:28.838 --> 27:30.272
I can't believe I didn't see that.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.340
Uh, sorry. I just...

27:32.341 --> 27:34.943
Pulled over to dial my
girlfriend and, you know,

27:34.944 --> 27:36.344
'cause I didn't want to
text while driving

27:36.345 --> 27:38.113
and you know, certainly
didn't want to hit anyone.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.549
Someone's got a problem
with authority figure...

27:40.550 --> 27:43.685
If it's all right with you,
I'll just dial my woman

27:43.686 --> 27:47.055
one more time and
then be on my way?

27:47.056 --> 27:50.492
You see, what I'd like you
to do is move your vehicle.

27:50.493 --> 27:52.060
- Now!
- Yes ma'am.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.995
Message received. 10-4. (Laughs)

27:53.996 --> 27:55.263
I'm so sorry.

27:56.999 --> 27:59.100
(Engine revs)

28:15.117 --> 28:16.818
Dani's computer isn't here.

28:41.210 --> 28:43.111
What are you doing in here?

28:43.112 --> 28:44.946
I'm calling security.

28:44.947 --> 28:46.615
I think Sebastian killed Dani Fox.

28:46.616 --> 28:48.483
What?

28:49.852 --> 28:53.188
Dani's crash was an accident.

28:53.189 --> 28:57.092
No. Sebastian murdered her
to stop her from exposing

28:57.093 --> 28:58.960
the truth about his
bogus research results.

28:58.961 --> 29:00.362
That's impossible.

29:00.363 --> 29:02.197
First, Sebastian wouldn't hurt a fly.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.299
Second, I went over
those results myself.

29:04.300 --> 29:05.867
They're totally accurate. And third,

29:05.868 --> 29:07.902
you even said that the treatment helped.

29:08.871 --> 29:11.573
I lied. I'm sorry,

29:11.574 --> 29:13.775
but I... I needed to see
what he was doing.

29:15.611 --> 29:17.345
I can't believe it.

29:17.346 --> 29:18.847
Are you sure?

29:18.848 --> 29:21.015
Can you prove any of this?

29:22.151 --> 29:24.219
I think the proof lives
on Dani's computer,

29:24.220 --> 29:26.300
but I can't access it
from outside the building.

29:30.559 --> 29:32.627
I can help you.

29:32.628 --> 29:34.095
Come with me.

29:49.578 --> 29:51.713
Linus, what's happening?
All I hear is static.

29:51.714 --> 29:53.081
We lost her when we circled the block.

29:53.082 --> 29:54.649
Well get her back. Fast.

29:55.718 --> 29:57.852
Dani insisted her
computer stay off network

29:57.853 --> 29:59.587
so no one could access
her research data.

29:59.588 --> 30:01.156
Dani was a smart woman.

30:01.157 --> 30:03.158
Yes. She was.

30:03.159 --> 30:04.592
I'll log you in.

30:04.593 --> 30:06.127
So she never said anything to you?

30:06.128 --> 30:08.396
No. But I knew something
was upsetting her.

30:09.632 --> 30:12.434
- It's all yours.
- Thanks.

30:12.435 --> 30:14.069
Wait. I'm still confused.

30:14.070 --> 30:16.471
How could Dani's accident
have been murder?

30:16.472 --> 30:19.341
Sebastian found a way to take
over her car's on-board computer

30:19.342 --> 30:21.042
and control it remotely...

30:21.043 --> 30:22.110
- (gasping)
- (Grunting)

30:22.111 --> 30:23.845
- Signal is gone.
- Where is she?

30:23.846 --> 30:26.014
- I can't find her. We have to go in.
- Go in where?

30:26.015 --> 30:27.615
She never told us where
in the building she is.

30:27.616 --> 30:29.551
Hang on, hang on. The thing down there.

30:29.552 --> 30:31.553
- You called it a go fish?
- It's a blowfish.

30:31.554 --> 30:33.221
Okay, whatever. It acts
like a cell phone tower?

30:33.222 --> 30:35.023
You're a genius.

30:39.328 --> 30:41.229
What? Come on!

30:42.431 --> 30:44.866
- (Beeping)
- You're a genius.

30:44.867 --> 30:47.002
George, you don't have to do this.

30:47.003 --> 30:48.803
(Grunts)

30:48.804 --> 30:51.373
If you hadn't lied to us,
we wouldn't have to.

30:51.374 --> 30:53.541
We?

30:53.542 --> 30:55.109
You brought this upon yourself.

30:56.245 --> 30:59.180
- You are a fraud.
- Well, it takes one to know one.

30:59.181 --> 31:01.016
The treatment doesn't work yet,

31:01.017 --> 31:04.152
at least not with the instant
results like the ones you faked.

31:04.153 --> 31:06.287
That's why you killed Dani.

31:06.288 --> 31:09.591
She knew and you couldn't
risk her telling anyone.

31:09.592 --> 31:12.360
I'm sorry about Dani, but we were
on the verge of a breakthrough.

31:12.361 --> 31:16.231
So you... you embellished your
research data to get more grant money.

31:16.232 --> 31:19.033
It's the only chance my wife has.

31:20.469 --> 31:22.270
Your wife.

31:25.574 --> 31:27.475
That patient you've been treating... Jane.

31:27.476 --> 31:28.877
She's your wife.

31:28.878 --> 31:30.845
She fell off a ladder three years ago.

31:30.846 --> 31:33.081
Doesn't know who I am.

31:33.082 --> 31:36.851
Well, I wonder if she would
recognize who you are now.

31:36.852 --> 31:37.919
Now what?

31:37.920 --> 31:39.788
Okay, now every hot
cell phone in the area

31:39.789 --> 31:41.122
will think this is a cell phone tower.

31:41.123 --> 31:42.957
We just need to wait for
Kirsten's number to pop up.

31:42.958 --> 31:44.626
And then we need to find it.

31:44.627 --> 31:47.128
That's my number and
there's the institute.

31:47.129 --> 31:49.130
Camille: Okay, only four
cell phones inside are hot.

31:49.131 --> 31:51.633
- One by the front door...
- And three in the southwest corner!

31:51.634 --> 31:52.667
Let's go!

31:52.668 --> 31:54.102
(Van door closes)

31:54.103 --> 31:55.303
Last time you were in that chair

31:55.304 --> 31:57.305
I saw something different
in your brainwave pattern,

31:57.306 --> 31:59.574
something that I've never seen before.

32:01.410 --> 32:02.877
You don't have to do this.

32:02.878 --> 32:05.980
I'll do whatever it
takes to help my wife.

32:05.981 --> 32:07.982
(Machine whirring)

32:14.723 --> 32:15.757
(Hissing)

32:15.758 --> 32:16.991
(Sirens wailing)

32:23.265 --> 32:25.233
(Waves crashing softly)

32:26.702 --> 32:28.002
(Gasping)

32:35.444 --> 32:36.911
Don't... don't hurt me.

32:38.914 --> 32:41.115
- Talk to me, Stretch.
- (Breathing heavily)

32:43.319 --> 32:44.953
You okay?

32:44.954 --> 32:47.589
Dr. Frankenstein and Igor
are experimenting on you.

32:47.590 --> 32:50.625
You guys were supposed to be listening in.
What took you so long?

32:50.626 --> 32:53.628
- Oh yeah. She's fine.
- Really, are you okay?

32:53.629 --> 32:56.197
- Why do people always do that?
- What?

32:56.198 --> 32:59.534
Ask if you're okay when
they know you're okay.

33:01.270 --> 33:02.504
Come on. Let's get out of here.

33:02.505 --> 33:04.972
Wait. No. No. I have to get
something from Dani's office.

33:16.418 --> 33:19.087
We just heard what happened.

33:19.088 --> 33:21.956
Well, at least the police caught Zuber.

33:21.957 --> 33:25.927
We... we wanted you to have this.

33:25.928 --> 33:27.562
What is it?

33:27.563 --> 33:29.998
It's the lease for the store

33:29.999 --> 33:31.966
that Dani rented for your bakery.

33:31.967 --> 33:34.502
Where did you get this?

33:34.503 --> 33:36.304
Kirsten: It was on her desk at work.

33:36.305 --> 33:38.306
She had even written up a business plan

33:38.307 --> 33:40.508
and put away money for you.

33:40.509 --> 33:43.011
That's what she was hiding.

33:43.012 --> 33:45.180
She wanted it to be a surprise.

33:45.181 --> 33:47.348
She believed in you.

33:53.856 --> 33:55.223
You sure you're all right?

33:55.224 --> 33:57.759
Yeah. Never better.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.427
Okay, Stretch. Get some rest.

33:59.428 --> 34:00.762
I'll see you tomorrow.

34:00.763 --> 34:05.099
When Zuber turned up the
power on his contraption,

34:05.100 --> 34:07.335
I... I saw things.

34:07.336 --> 34:10.338
Kirsten: Memories. Lots of them.

34:10.339 --> 34:12.273
Mostly from people that I've stitched

34:12.274 --> 34:14.042
but also me...

34:14.043 --> 34:15.643
When I was a kid.

34:15.643 --> 34:19.714
I was in water and I had an
electrode harness on my head.

34:19.715 --> 34:22.116
Zuber pumped magnetic
pulses through your brain.

34:22.117 --> 34:24.284
If you saw a monkey playing a
tuba, I wouldn't be surprised.

34:24.286 --> 34:27.455
Yeah. I suppose.

34:29.225 --> 34:32.193
- Thank you.
- For what?

34:33.661 --> 34:35.263
For not being a nobody.

34:49.178 --> 34:51.379
Camille?

34:57.920 --> 34:59.654
Camille isn't here.

35:12.846 --> 35:15.446
So nice to finally meet you, Kirsten.

35:17.265 --> 35:19.733
Where's Camille?

35:19.734 --> 35:21.935
Last I've heard, out with Linus.

35:22.804 --> 35:24.371
How'd you get in here?

35:24.372 --> 35:27.775
My old friend Ed Clark once
gave me a key to his house.

35:27.776 --> 35:29.443
And your right to use it ended

35:29.444 --> 35:31.578
when he died and it became my house.

35:31.579 --> 35:33.947
I'm sorry.

35:36.918 --> 35:38.852
- May we talk?
- You know,

35:38.853 --> 35:41.121
Mr. Turner, it's been a long day.

35:41.122 --> 35:43.624
And, as perhaps you've
heard, I'm kind of fried.

35:43.625 --> 35:45.392
(Scoffs)

35:45.393 --> 35:47.661
And Maggie said you didn't
have a sense of humor.

35:47.662 --> 35:49.730
Are you going to avoid my
questions like Maggie does?

35:49.731 --> 35:50.898
Haven't heard a question yet,

35:50.899 --> 35:52.466
but ask me one, and I'll answer it.

35:52.467 --> 35:55.869
Marta said that the
murder cases we handle

35:55.870 --> 35:58.105
are test runs for something bigger,

35:58.106 --> 36:00.641
the real purpose of the program.

36:00.642 --> 36:01.875
Is that true?

36:01.876 --> 36:03.410
Yes.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.245
Test runs for what?

36:05.246 --> 36:06.880
I don't know.

36:06.881 --> 36:08.982
I don't believe that the
director of a program

36:08.983 --> 36:10.717
like this wouldn't know its purpose.

36:10.718 --> 36:13.720
I understand, but it's...
It's common practice

36:13.721 --> 36:14.988
in the clandestine services.

36:14.989 --> 36:16.390
Is that what you call this?

36:16.391 --> 36:18.826
The point is, no one single person

36:18.827 --> 36:20.627
in the agency knows
everything... even me.

36:20.628 --> 36:22.162
That's how they keep the program safe.

36:22.163 --> 36:23.764
That's how they keep us all safe.

36:23.765 --> 36:25.832
Like you kept us safe from Marta.

36:30.472 --> 36:33.574
Marta's betrayal...

36:33.575 --> 36:36.109
Well, it came as a shock to me too.

36:36.110 --> 36:38.078
But that's over now.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.918
I know you have questions,

36:44.919 --> 36:46.687
doubts,

36:46.688 --> 36:48.822
but you need to trust that
the people in your life

36:48.823 --> 36:52.326
that cared about you...
your mother, Ed Clark,

36:52.327 --> 36:54.661
and the people who care about you now...

36:54.662 --> 36:57.764
your team, Maggie,
myself, and the agency...

36:57.765 --> 37:02.936
all have been and are working
tirelessly to keep you safe.

37:08.643 --> 37:14.548
So... we just keep doing
what we're doing?

37:16.518 --> 37:22.189
Ask no questions until someone decides
to let us in on the big secret?

37:23.691 --> 37:25.659
Well, that's... That's worked for me.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.961
I'm not you.

37:27.962 --> 37:29.896
I know.

37:35.703 --> 37:37.237
Thanks for listening.

37:39.741 --> 37:42.042
Did Ed Clark commit suicide?

37:48.316 --> 37:49.850
No.

37:49.851 --> 37:51.852
How did he die?

37:51.853 --> 37:54.287
Protecting you.

38:00.295 --> 38:01.862
(Door closes)

38:05.099 --> 38:06.533
(Alternative music playing)

38:37.599 --> 38:40.233
"Four letter word for inviolable."

38:44.372 --> 38:45.972
Safe.

38:55.917 --> 38:58.118
(Phone buzzing)

39:05.727 --> 39:07.394
Linus, what?

39:07.395 --> 39:09.630
- I'm still in bed.
- <i>I'm looking for Kirsten.</i>

39:09.631 --> 39:11.531
Do you know where she is?
She's not answering her phone.

39:11.532 --> 39:14.000
Yeah. Hold on.

39:16.170 --> 39:18.972
Hey, Sleeping Beauty, wake up.

39:18.973 --> 39:21.842
- What?
- It's Linus.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.747
What, Linus?

39:26.748 --> 39:29.116
Are you really in bed with Camille?

39:29.117 --> 39:31.451
Are you really calling this early?

39:31.452 --> 39:35.222
Those digital codes on the
cassette that Ed gave you...

39:35.223 --> 39:37.090
<i>quantum computer figured them out.</i>

39:37.091 --> 39:39.025
They're map coordinates.

39:41.262 --> 39:43.302
<i>Okay, seriously... are you
in bed with Camille?</i>

39:49.437 --> 39:51.071
(Birds chirping)

40:11.225 --> 40:12.792
(Sighs)

40:14.962 --> 40:21.001
Ed... what did you want me to remember?

40:28.476 --> 40:32.979
It's okay to be sad about
what happened to your mom.

40:32.980 --> 40:38.285
Remember, you can even
touch her picture if you want.

40:49.163 --> 40:50.997

- (Gasps)
