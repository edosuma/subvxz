[Both chuckle]

00:35.401 --> 00:37.135
Oh, my--

00:55.421 --> 00:56.520
15 minutes.

00:56.622 --> 00:58.356
All right,
no problem.

01:36.295 --> 01:37.528
Jimmy?

01:37.596 --> 01:39.130
Are you doing that?

01:39.198 --> 01:40.665
I can feel that,
Jimmy.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.733
I know you're doing
that, man. Stop!

Open the door, man!
Open the door!
Let me out!

02:04.657 --> 02:06.091
Get me out of here!
Open this door!

02:06.158 --> 02:07.792
Open this door!
[Panting]

02:07.827 --> 02:10.127
Open this door!
Let me out!

02:10.196 --> 02:12.496
[Kicking continues]

02:12.565 --> 02:14.498
[Screaming]

02:19.805 --> 02:20.938
Man: Just calm down.

02:21.007 --> 02:22.107
Take it easy.
Second man: Calm down?

02:22.174 --> 02:24.609
Just calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!

02:24.676 --> 02:26.978
That freaking morgue
is haunted, ok?!

02:26.980 --> 02:28.780
I should be suing
you guys.

02:28.848 --> 02:30.648
Look, it was a stupid
high school prank.

02:30.716 --> 02:32.016
My grandson is sorry.

02:32.084 --> 02:33.217
What are you
talking about?
I'm not sorry!

02:33.285 --> 02:34.619
Hey, Vicky.
Hey.

02:34.687 --> 02:36.053
What's going on here?

02:36.189 --> 02:39.791
Eh, I don't know.
Some kids broke into
the morgue last night.

02:39.859 --> 02:42.126
Why?
Bored. Stupid.

02:42.194 --> 02:44.295
All of the above.

02:44.363 --> 02:46.231
Oh, wow,
look at this.

02:46.365 --> 02:48.799
Look at that clamp.
What year do you think
that is?

02:48.868 --> 02:50.634
Ah, fifties, I think.

02:50.702 --> 02:52.503
The hospital's
clearing out storage,

02:52.538 --> 02:54.372
getting rid
of all this old junk.
Oh.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.073
Now that is beautiful.

02:56.142 --> 02:57.475
You can take it
if you want it.

02:57.543 --> 02:58.709
Really?

02:58.777 --> 02:59.844
Sure.

02:59.912 --> 03:01.413
It's just going to get
melted down anyway.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.780
[Whispers]
It's our secret. Shh.

03:06.084 --> 03:08.152
Check this out.

03:08.221 --> 03:10.855
How cool
is that, huh?

03:10.923 --> 03:12.189
What is it?

03:12.257 --> 03:13.624
Well,
it's an old version
of a tool

03:13.692 --> 03:15.026
that your dad uses
at work.

03:15.094 --> 03:17.796
It's called
a suction cannula.

03:17.930 --> 03:20.164
It's a suction tube,
really.

03:20.232 --> 03:22.267
You use it
for an operation?

03:22.301 --> 03:23.535
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.403
Except now,
we use better ones,
newer ones.

03:28.107 --> 03:29.341
I don't like operations.

03:29.408 --> 03:31.709
[Laughs]
Good.

03:31.777 --> 03:32.843
Nobody likes
an operation.

03:32.911 --> 03:34.278
But sometimes,
you know,

03:34.346 --> 03:37.115
that's the only way
we can make
somebody healthy.

03:37.182 --> 03:40.018
We have to go in
and fix something
inside of them,

03:40.020 --> 03:42.220
something
that's making them
sick.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.487
And this kind
of thing gives

03:43.556 --> 03:44.923
a person
a second chance.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.099
I'm sorry.

03:54.133 --> 03:56.534
Baby, sorry for what?

03:56.602 --> 03:57.902
I don't know.

03:57.970 --> 03:59.971
I just feel like
I did something wrong.

04:00.039 --> 04:01.873
No, no,
we wanted you
to hold it.

04:01.941 --> 04:03.875
No. You didn't do
anything wrong.

04:03.976 --> 04:05.176
In fact,
you are perfect.

04:05.278 --> 04:06.444
Well, I don't know
about that.

04:06.512 --> 04:07.979
What'd she say,
you're perfect?

04:08.080 --> 04:08.813
[Giggles]

04:08.881 --> 04:10.982
I think he's
pretty perfect.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.785
You know, you're good,
for a little boy.
You'll do all right.

04:13.787 --> 04:14.986
I mean, you know,
he'll do in a pinch.

04:15.054 --> 04:16.454
[Aiden giggles]
I think he's tired.

04:16.522 --> 04:17.588
I'm going
to take you up,

04:17.656 --> 04:19.055
and you're going to have
the best bath ever.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.357
We're going to get
your teeth brushed.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.627
We know how much
you like that, right?

04:22.694 --> 04:26.197
Did you see
the new toothbrush
mom got you?

04:26.265 --> 04:27.899
[Continues indistinctly]

04:30.369 --> 04:33.037
Child, whispering:
Can you see us?

05:03.402 --> 05:04.436
Man: How cheesy
is that?

05:04.503 --> 05:06.371
But I just had
to get it.
Absolutely.

05:06.438 --> 05:08.038
It is a must-have.

05:08.106 --> 05:09.707
But I think
you have to have
the whole collection,

05:09.775 --> 05:11.876
like
world's greatest mom,

05:11.910 --> 05:14.078
world's greatest boss.
You know,
all the categories.

05:14.113 --> 05:15.913
Did you ever get
world's greatest lawyer?

05:15.981 --> 05:18.383
Oddly...No.

05:18.450 --> 05:20.017
Poor baby.
[Both laugh]

05:20.085 --> 05:21.852
Is everything ok?
Yeah.

05:21.921 --> 05:23.654
You know,

05:23.722 --> 05:25.924
I don't meet
too many people
with a sense of humor.

05:25.991 --> 05:26.858
I know what you mean.

05:26.992 --> 05:28.426
No, the truth is,

05:28.460 --> 05:30.494
cheesy figurines aside,

05:30.562 --> 05:33.298
I don't really know
how to date.

05:33.365 --> 05:35.166
I mean, I know how,

05:35.168 --> 05:38.770
just not, you know,
reading all the signals
and all the--

05:38.804 --> 05:40.605
I mean,
after my divorce,
I just--

05:40.672 --> 05:42.940
I hibernated.

05:42.975 --> 05:46.010
Look, dating is hard enough
for teenagers to figure out,

05:46.077 --> 05:48.078
let alone
people our age.

05:48.113 --> 05:50.114
An enigma wrapped
inside a riddle.

05:50.249 --> 05:52.350
Exactly.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.485
Oh! Did you order wine?

05:54.553 --> 05:57.254
No. I may have thought it,
but I didn't order it.

05:57.389 --> 06:00.057
Please, this is with
my compliments.

06:00.125 --> 06:02.293
Oh, that's very sweet,
but I can't have any
right now.

06:02.394 --> 06:04.629
Oh, no, no, no.
You must.

06:04.696 --> 06:06.330
This is
a beautiful vintage.

06:06.398 --> 06:07.631
You'll love it.

06:07.666 --> 06:09.434
That is so nice,
but if I drink in
the middle of the day,

06:09.502 --> 06:10.635
I can't accomplish
anything.

06:10.702 --> 06:11.969
No, no, I insist.

06:12.104 --> 06:13.237
Uh, excuse me.
The lady said--

06:13.305 --> 06:14.506
aah!
Oh!

06:14.573 --> 06:16.274
Oh, damn it!

06:16.342 --> 06:17.975
What the hell
is wrong with you?
What are you, stupid?

06:18.043 --> 06:18.909
I am so sorry.

06:18.977 --> 06:20.211
Don't just stand there,
you moron!

06:20.312 --> 06:22.079
Get her some towels.
Ok, it's ok.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.515
I just didn't expect it.

06:23.582 --> 06:25.450
Well, of course not.

06:25.484 --> 06:27.117
I mean, how could
you expect someone
to be so stupid?

06:27.219 --> 06:29.554
We didn't want
the damn wine
to start with,

06:29.622 --> 06:31.422
and she certainly
doesn't want
to be wearing it!

06:31.590 --> 06:33.291
What are you,
totally brainless?

06:33.392 --> 06:35.160
I'm so sorry.
Please let me pay
for the cleaning.

06:35.227 --> 06:37.061
Really? You think?

06:37.129 --> 06:37.761
You'll pay
for the cleaning

06:37.897 --> 06:39.130
and you'll pay
for lunch!

06:39.198 --> 06:40.164
Hey,
that's enough.

06:40.299 --> 06:42.667
I mean,
nobody died here, ok?

06:42.768 --> 06:43.868
I'm just gonna, um--

06:43.969 --> 06:46.203
I'm just gonna go
take care of this.

06:48.674 --> 06:49.774
Is this really ok?

06:49.841 --> 06:50.808
Yeah, it looks
great on you.

06:50.876 --> 06:53.043
Ok, but do I smell
like wine?

06:53.045 --> 06:54.779
Oh, it's ok.
It's a good year.

06:54.847 --> 06:56.781
[Laughs]
So besides all that,

06:56.849 --> 06:58.950
how did you
enjoy the play,
Mrs. Lincoln?

06:59.018 --> 07:01.553
You know, the irony is,
I was enjoying it just fine.

07:01.620 --> 07:02.953
I've been dating
a lot of guys,

07:03.021 --> 07:04.622
and they're all turning out
to be so dull.

07:04.689 --> 07:07.625
Roger was kind of funny,
he was smart,

07:07.692 --> 07:10.128
he was a little corny,
in a good way.

07:10.195 --> 07:11.462
And he listened.

07:11.530 --> 07:13.097
You know how hard
that is to find?

07:13.165 --> 07:14.766
So, are you going
to go out with him
again?

07:14.833 --> 07:16.767
You know, my mom
always told me

07:16.835 --> 07:19.303
never to date a guy
who was mean
to waiters, so...

07:19.404 --> 07:21.105
God, was he really
that bad?

07:21.107 --> 07:22.874
Well, it's not like
the maitre d'
wasn't obnoxious,

07:22.942 --> 07:24.275
and it isn't
the first time

07:24.343 --> 07:25.810
he ever spilled something
on me.

07:25.877 --> 07:28.979
I guess I should just
wear a rain slicker
when I go to lento's.

07:29.048 --> 07:31.348
[Chuckles]
But Roger, I don't know.

07:31.417 --> 07:34.718
I saw this meanness
underneath, so...

07:34.753 --> 07:36.955
I think I'm just going
to have to throw
that one back.

07:37.022 --> 07:38.222
See you later?

07:38.290 --> 07:39.791
Yep.

07:39.859 --> 07:40.658
Thanks.
Bye.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.025
Bye.

08:21.566 --> 08:23.467
[Knocks]

08:25.804 --> 08:27.538
[Scoffs]

08:35.080 --> 08:36.481
[Knocks]

08:38.082 --> 08:39.984
[Knocking continues]

08:56.769 --> 08:57.802
Melinda:
You're kidding.

08:57.869 --> 08:58.969
Jim: No,
I wish I was.

08:59.037 --> 09:00.738
I just had to sedate
the attendant

09:00.839 --> 09:02.773
who now thinks
the morgue is haunted.

09:02.841 --> 09:04.642
Well, can I come over
and check it out?

09:04.710 --> 09:06.811
No, the morgue's got
back-to-back autopsies
all day long.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.079
So maybe
tomorrow morning?

09:08.180 --> 09:09.847
Yeah, after I put Aiden
on the bus.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.582
Maybe you could call
Eli. He might know
something about it.

09:11.650 --> 09:14.452
Eli's been sick all week.
We're on our own.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.620
Let me try him at home.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.687
All right. Bye.

09:16.754 --> 09:19.223
Dr. Clancy?
You got a minute?

10:04.569 --> 10:06.503
[Tap twists
and water runs]

10:11.076 --> 10:13.077
Aiden?

10:26.425 --> 10:29.159
Um...

10:29.227 --> 10:30.894
Hello?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.735
Can I ask
what you're doing?

10:37.803 --> 10:39.971
Is everything ready?

10:40.072 --> 10:41.772
Sorry?

10:41.840 --> 10:44.174
Is everything ready

10:44.276 --> 10:45.209
in the O.R.?

10:45.277 --> 10:47.378
Patient is ready,
doctor.

11:05.864 --> 11:07.197
Jim: We better find
this ghost quick, Mel.

11:07.266 --> 11:08.766
We only have
a few minutes.

11:08.833 --> 11:10.200
Hello?

11:10.269 --> 11:12.270
How can I help you?

11:12.337 --> 11:13.771
You sound like
customer service.

11:13.838 --> 11:16.440
Well, kind of is.

11:16.508 --> 11:19.109
Oh, I feel something
toxic here.

11:19.177 --> 11:21.044
Very dangerous.

11:26.284 --> 11:27.684
What the...

11:29.455 --> 11:31.155
[Gasps] Oh.

11:34.526 --> 11:35.659
[Gasps]

11:38.730 --> 11:40.331
Back off. Get down.
Oh!

11:48.139 --> 11:51.242
Yeah, you've got
a haunted morgue here.

11:56.448 --> 11:58.315
[Rap music playing
indistinctly]

12:01.253 --> 12:03.187
Paul?

12:03.255 --> 12:04.455
Paul Jett?

12:04.490 --> 12:06.190
Who wants to know?

12:06.225 --> 12:07.791
My name is Melinda Gordon.
I'd like to talk to you

12:07.859 --> 12:09.727
about what happened
at Rockland memorial.

12:09.795 --> 12:10.827
Are you 5-0?

12:10.863 --> 12:12.096
I'm sorry, what now?

12:12.164 --> 12:14.398
The po-po,
the man, the heat.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.101
I am not the police,
if that's even remotely close
to what you're asking me.

12:18.169 --> 12:19.803
Yo, then we got
nothin' to talk about.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.638
[Laughter]

12:24.543 --> 12:26.043
Look,
from what I heard,

12:26.111 --> 12:28.546
you pretty thrilled
when the po-po showed up
the other night

12:28.614 --> 12:31.715
as you were screaming
your head off in the morgue.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.017
I talk to ghosts.

12:34.085 --> 12:35.519
I can see ghosts.

12:35.621 --> 12:38.755
It's not something
I want other people
to know about,

12:38.823 --> 12:40.591
for obvious reasons.

12:40.658 --> 12:42.426
But I am telling you
because I want to know

12:42.494 --> 12:44.095
what happened
the other night.

12:50.302 --> 12:53.604
15 minutes, the alley
behind the station.

12:59.477 --> 13:01.845
Ugh. Ew.

13:01.913 --> 13:03.580
Hey.

13:03.615 --> 13:05.749
I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.885
Do you want to go
somewhere more comfortable?

13:09.188 --> 13:10.387
Oh, I know.

13:10.455 --> 13:13.056
The tough guy thing,
it's just an act.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.358
It's my mask.

13:14.459 --> 13:16.026
I don't get it.

13:16.028 --> 13:18.462
Survival. Look,
I just moved here

13:18.529 --> 13:20.030
to live with
my grandfather.

13:20.098 --> 13:22.866
At my old school,
they all said
I was this prodigy--

13:22.934 --> 13:25.702
national honor society,
science club,

13:25.770 --> 13:28.406
future mathematicians,
blah, blah, blah.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.606
You make it sound
like a bad thing.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.343
You know what it's like
having an I.Q. Of 135?

13:32.411 --> 13:34.544
No.

13:34.612 --> 13:35.979
It's hell.

13:36.047 --> 13:37.881
And all it ever got me
was ignored by girls

13:37.949 --> 13:39.850
and my butt
kicked by jocks.

13:39.918 --> 13:42.119
There's no way
I was going to be
the new nerd in town.

13:42.187 --> 13:44.855
So you make
everybody believe
that you're a thug?

13:45.023 --> 13:46.123
Semantics.
Right.

13:46.191 --> 13:48.659
I prefer to think
of myself as bad boy.

13:48.727 --> 13:51.728
It's amazing, you know.
It's all about perception.

13:51.763 --> 13:53.664
Everyone thinks
I'm a badass
from day one,

13:53.731 --> 13:55.433
and suddenly,
it's like
I'm untouchable.

13:55.534 --> 13:57.635
What happened
in the morgue?

13:57.736 --> 13:59.403
It was an initiation.

13:59.471 --> 14:03.040
Not into the future
mathematicians club,
I take it?

14:03.108 --> 14:06.810
I was supposed to stay
in an empty morgue drawer
for 15 minutes.

14:06.879 --> 14:09.012
What happened?
Did you see something?

14:09.047 --> 14:12.816
No,
but I felt something--

14:12.885 --> 14:14.818
someone touching me.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.487
You know, at first
I just thought it was,

14:16.554 --> 14:18.689
like, one of the guys
hazing me or something.

14:18.790 --> 14:20.090
Did you hear anything?

14:20.158 --> 14:22.425
Other than
my heartbeat?

14:22.493 --> 14:23.593
No.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.396
So what if I need to
talk to you again?

14:26.465 --> 14:29.300
Oh, uh,
just text me.

14:29.367 --> 14:30.968
9-1-1,
I'll meet you here.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.237
Ok.

14:44.782 --> 14:46.817

15:06.705 --> 15:08.939

15:09.040 --> 15:10.340

and ready, doctor.

Here you are, doctor.

We are going
to fix you up, son.

Just calm down, son.

17:33.451 --> 17:36.286
Ooh! I love this!
Do you know
who's doing it?

17:36.354 --> 17:37.988
Yes--

17:38.156 --> 17:41.224
Roger "I seem nice
but I'm really mean"
Shepard.

17:41.292 --> 17:43.326
He's called me
a few times, but I'm not
calling him back.

17:43.394 --> 17:45.696
All right,
so he's on a mission.
He wants to win you over.

17:45.764 --> 17:47.064
Yeah, not gonna happen.

17:47.132 --> 17:48.465
Famous last words.

17:48.533 --> 17:50.800
[Sighs]
So, is there any news

17:50.869 --> 17:52.669
about all the weirdness
happening at the morgue?

17:52.737 --> 17:54.938
She said,
changing the subject.

17:55.006 --> 17:56.807
How do you know
about the morgue?

17:56.842 --> 17:58.909
Are you kidding?
It's all over town.

17:58.977 --> 18:01.912
People are saying
that dead bodies
are coming to life.

18:01.980 --> 18:03.013
No.
These bodies are dead.

18:03.081 --> 18:04.647
The ghost is just
manipulating them.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.917
Oh. Well, that ought to
make people feel better.

18:06.985 --> 18:08.685
Now what are
the grown-ups

18:08.720 --> 18:10.421
at the hospital saying?
Oh, well,

18:10.522 --> 18:13.424
it's explainable.
I mean, muscle spasms,
rigor mortis,

18:13.491 --> 18:14.591
blah, blah, blah.

18:14.659 --> 18:17.127
How do you deal with
a haunting like this?

18:17.228 --> 18:19.430
Ineptly, so far.
And I keep getting distracted

18:19.497 --> 18:21.098
by all these visions
I'm getting from Aiden.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.732
He keeps having
weird surgery nightmares.

18:22.767 --> 18:24.001
How do you know
that they're his?

18:24.068 --> 18:25.669
It's been happening
a lot lately.

18:25.737 --> 18:28.305
Getting used to it.
Oh, poor kid.

18:28.406 --> 18:29.406
No, it's fine.

18:29.473 --> 18:30.874
He doesn't remember
any of them.

18:30.942 --> 18:32.709
I get them
loud and clear.

18:32.777 --> 18:35.845
Same one,
same time every night.

18:35.914 --> 18:38.315
Man, you have got
so much on your plate.

18:38.350 --> 18:40.717
And I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

18:40.752 --> 18:44.654
Are you sure
you don't want to give Roger
a second chance?

18:44.722 --> 18:46.357
A lot of fish
in the sea,

18:46.424 --> 18:47.657
and all that.

18:47.759 --> 18:49.025
But it proves he has
a romantic side!

18:49.094 --> 18:51.027
And besides, you told me
that that ma垌re d'
was obnoxious

18:51.096 --> 18:53.464
and had spilled things
on you before, so maybe...

18:53.532 --> 18:56.867
Roger was just,
I don't know,
protecting you.

18:56.935 --> 18:58.468
Ok, I admit it,

18:58.536 --> 19:01.738
the violets
were impressive.

19:01.806 --> 19:04.775
But they're not
a get out of jail
card.

[Door chimes]

19:09.214 --> 19:10.614
Eli...

19:10.682 --> 19:12.950
There's no easy way
to break this to you,

19:13.018 --> 19:16.286
so I'm just going to
give it to you straight.

19:16.354 --> 19:18.555
You don't have
swine flu.

19:18.623 --> 19:21.357
You have laryngitis.

19:21.426 --> 19:24.828
No, and you don't
have flesh eating
bacteria, either.

19:24.896 --> 19:27.464
It's probably
just hives.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.968
You had hives all over
your rear end through
the whole fourth grade.

19:31.036 --> 19:34.804
Eli, what is all
this stuff? Ahh.

"Typical morning
conversation with mom."

19:45.549 --> 19:48.185
I'm just trying
to take care of you.

19:48.253 --> 19:51.688
Did I just walk into
the middle of <i>family feud?</i>

You got it.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.640
I know when
I'm not wanted.

or whatever's your poison
and...

20:13.511 --> 20:15.612
Ahem.

Be grateful I believe
in house calls.

he's gone. I--

20:21.786 --> 20:23.453
what?

20:23.521 --> 20:24.688
I killed him. I--

20:24.756 --> 20:27.591

attached to this
instrument, big time."

20:40.171 --> 20:42.206
You've had 2 hauntings
from this surgeon ghost.

20:42.273 --> 20:44.308
Why didn't you tell me
there was a spirit
attached to this thing?

20:44.375 --> 20:46.310
I didn't know.
I thought the visions
that I was having

20:46.377 --> 20:48.011
were Aiden's dreams,
and he was sending them
to me.

20:48.079 --> 20:50.180
Sorry. A guy
just likes to know
who's in his house,

20:50.248 --> 20:51.948
especially
if they're dead.

20:52.016 --> 20:53.283
Do you have a date
or something?

20:53.351 --> 20:55.285
Well, kind of.
Just stay with me.

20:55.353 --> 20:57.120
Ok.
So what's the deal
with this ghost?

20:57.188 --> 20:58.788
Well, if he's attached
to the instrument,

20:58.856 --> 21:00.123
then it's
an imprint haunting.

21:00.191 --> 21:01.291
Oh, not a ghost loop.

21:01.359 --> 21:02.459

that, right?

Yeah, exactly.

reliving a traumatic event

over and over again

until he can figure out
how to make it right.

an understatement.

how can I help?

kind of surgery this
ghost is performing?

I can do better
than tell you.

25:13.777 --> 25:15.812
[Woman screaming]

25:17.381 --> 25:19.682
Man: Get out of here.
Everybody out.

25:19.750 --> 25:20.817
I can't believe that!
Clear the morgue.

25:20.885 --> 25:22.486
Second man:
You see that?
Go, go!

25:22.553 --> 25:24.488
[Panting]

25:26.523 --> 25:27.690
[Man exhales]

25:29.159 --> 25:31.428
[Heavy breathing]

25:38.570 --> 25:40.737

25:40.838 --> 25:42.572
[Breathing stops]

25:55.720 --> 25:57.887
[Exhales]

26:03.428 --> 26:05.762
Oh, this ghost
is getting
on my nerves.

26:05.830 --> 26:06.930
Your nerves?

26:06.997 --> 26:08.432
My heartbeat's
still at warp speed.

26:08.499 --> 26:10.099
Did you get
the ghost
surgeon's name?

26:10.167 --> 26:12.936
Ah, yeah.
It's Dr. Albert Glassman.

26:13.003 --> 26:15.271
The guy ran cardiology.
But get this--

26:15.340 --> 26:18.775
he died the same day
that the patient
he was operating died,

26:18.843 --> 26:21.244
October 16th, 1959.

26:21.312 --> 26:22.779
I don't get it.
How can that be?

26:22.847 --> 26:24.614
I don't know. I mean,
sometimes the paperwork
can get messed up

26:24.682 --> 26:27.050
and the dates
can get confused, but...

26:27.117 --> 26:29.219
Ok, well, did you get
the patient's name
who died on the table?

26:29.286 --> 26:30.721
No. Not that, either.

26:30.788 --> 26:32.823
I had one more page to go
when the screaming started.

26:32.923 --> 26:34.658
Well, look, I mean
if the morgue ghost

26:34.726 --> 26:36.727
is the patient that
Dr. Glassman killed
during surgery,

26:36.794 --> 26:38.061
we have to get
those two together,

26:38.128 --> 26:39.229
because then
the morgue ghost

26:39.296 --> 26:40.430
can forgive
Dr. Glassman,

26:40.498 --> 26:41.898
Dr. Glassman
can stop reliving

26:41.966 --> 26:43.233
the same mistake
over and over again,

26:43.300 --> 26:44.568
and hopefully,
at some point,

26:44.635 --> 26:46.069
we can get
a good night's sleep.

26:46.136 --> 26:47.871
What?

26:47.938 --> 26:50.306
Why is there a mime
following Delia?

26:50.408 --> 26:52.676
[Indistinct]

26:52.710 --> 26:53.809
Oh.

26:53.877 --> 26:56.012
[Delia speaks
indistinctly]

27:03.821 --> 27:05.554
Oh!

27:05.622 --> 27:06.989
Please go away.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.125
I'm begging you.

27:09.227 --> 27:10.960
Ok.

27:11.028 --> 27:12.628
Thank you so much.
I've got it.

27:12.696 --> 27:14.230
Bye-bye now.

27:18.069 --> 27:20.970
I'm gonna read it.

27:21.039 --> 27:23.340
Oh, sweet.
Very sweet, ok.

27:24.509 --> 27:26.676
[Sighs]

27:26.778 --> 27:28.445
Ok.

27:28.447 --> 27:31.748
"Roses red,
violets are blue,

27:31.750 --> 27:34.283
I can't hide
my feelings."

27:35.586 --> 27:36.820
Ok. I'm gonna go now,

27:36.921 --> 27:38.088
and I wish
you would stop that,

27:38.155 --> 27:39.622
'cause you're kinda
creeping me out.

27:41.925 --> 27:43.126
Ok, please.

27:43.261 --> 27:44.594
Would you please stop?
Just stop crying.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.930
Stop crying.
Would you please
stop crying?

27:46.932 --> 27:48.265
I'm sorry
I hurt your feelings--

27:49.466 --> 27:50.700
seriously?

27:52.103 --> 27:54.370
You want a tip. Ok.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.474
There's your tip.
Thanks so much.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.109
You're very, uh...

27:59.143 --> 28:00.776
Talented.

28:05.983 --> 28:07.517
Taxi!

28:19.330 --> 28:21.597
I know who you are.

28:21.665 --> 28:25.768
You're a patient
of Dr. Albert Glassman.

28:25.836 --> 28:28.271
You had a congenital
heart defect.

28:28.339 --> 28:30.940
He was trying
to repair it.

28:31.008 --> 28:32.308
You died in surgery.

28:32.343 --> 28:34.477
[Sighs]

28:34.544 --> 28:37.580
I know
that you're angry.

28:37.648 --> 28:41.817
And just so you know,
Dr. Glassman is
very upset, too,

28:41.819 --> 28:44.120
you're both stuck here,

28:44.188 --> 28:46.990
earthbound because
of your anger and...

28:47.057 --> 28:48.225
His guilt.
[Gas hisses]

28:52.230 --> 28:54.297
It's time to end it.

28:56.167 --> 28:57.500
What's your name?

28:57.568 --> 28:59.902
You know me.

28:59.971 --> 29:02.672
I've seen you,
but I don't know
your name.

29:02.774 --> 29:04.874
[Exhales]

29:04.942 --> 29:07.510
I can feel your anger.

29:07.578 --> 29:09.045
You want revenge.

29:19.023 --> 29:20.757
What happened to you
was terrible...

29:22.627 --> 29:24.327
It was just
an accident.

29:24.362 --> 29:25.929
What happened to me,

29:25.996 --> 29:27.763
what happened
to everybody here,

29:27.832 --> 29:29.598
was no accident.

who you are,

29:55.892 --> 29:58.194
or if you even know
what's going on.

29:59.930 --> 30:02.031
But what's about
to happen

30:02.099 --> 30:05.034
was an accident.

30:05.102 --> 30:07.870
And you're going
to feel angry,

30:07.938 --> 30:10.873
like you want revenge,
but please,

30:10.941 --> 30:15.211
just cross over
and find some peace.

that I don't know your name.

to pull you away

30:40.070 --> 30:41.737
from all
the Grandview
unrulies,

30:41.805 --> 30:43.373
but I have a very
important question.

30:43.441 --> 30:44.607
Speak.

30:44.675 --> 30:46.642
Do you know if
you're related
to a William Jett?

30:46.710 --> 30:48.778
What's it to you?

30:48.780 --> 30:50.546
Sorry. I mean,
why do you ask?

30:50.615 --> 30:52.782
Sometimes,
in the spirit world,

30:52.850 --> 30:54.985
a ghost can be
earth-bound but dormant.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.385
I think
when you broke into
the morgue

30:56.454 --> 31:00.290
that you stirred up
the ghost of your
relative, William Jett.

31:00.424 --> 31:03.826
The ghost
of William Jett?

31:03.894 --> 31:05.127
He's been haunting
the hospital.

31:05.195 --> 31:06.563
He's still angry
with the surgeon

31:06.664 --> 31:08.831
he thinks caused
his death all those
years ago.

31:08.899 --> 31:12.368
Look, no judgment,
but whatever you're on,

31:12.436 --> 31:13.570
there is help available.

31:13.637 --> 31:15.705
Ok, I know
it's a lot to take in,

31:15.806 --> 31:18.074
but I really need you
to reach out to
your relative

31:18.141 --> 31:19.709
and see if you can
get him to forgive

31:19.843 --> 31:21.611
the surgeon he blames
for his death.

31:21.679 --> 31:24.313
Now, how are you related
to William Jett?

31:24.382 --> 31:26.249
Bill Jett.

31:26.317 --> 31:28.484
That's my grandfather.

31:28.586 --> 31:30.119

Wait a minute.

31:30.187 --> 31:32.288
How can he be
your grandfather?

31:32.356 --> 31:35.325
He died in 1959,
and he was only
a teenager.

31:35.393 --> 31:38.094
Dude, my grandfather
is a lot of things,

31:38.162 --> 31:39.562

one of them.

the senior triathlon.

and totally disgusted

street cred.

31:48.305 --> 31:49.973
Yeah, it's just me
and my grandfather
right now.

to meet him.

you're dead.

Well, if you're
the welcoming committee,

32:01.619 --> 32:03.319
that's fine.

32:03.387 --> 32:05.021
Please, bear with me.

32:05.122 --> 32:06.856
Aren't you
the William Jett

32:06.958 --> 32:10.092
who had heart surgery
in 1959?

32:10.161 --> 32:13.096
True.
On my 16th birthday,
no less.

32:13.163 --> 32:17.400
But you didn't--
I saw it--

32:17.468 --> 32:20.070
I thought
that the doctor made
a mistake,

32:20.137 --> 32:22.238
and that you died
on the table.

32:25.275 --> 32:27.143
Ahh.

32:27.210 --> 32:29.979
Dr. Glassman
didn't kill me.

32:31.415 --> 32:34.016
I killed him.

32:43.460 --> 32:45.228
Most people don't
accept it so easily

when I say
I can see ghosts.

Are you kidding?
I think it's a great gift.

Yeah, but you were
wrong this time.

help me understand
why my grandson

32:55.906 --> 32:57.373
thinks its cooler
to hang

32:57.441 --> 32:59.709
with a group
of monosyllabic morons

32:59.777 --> 33:01.711
than use the brain
he was blessed with?

33:01.779 --> 33:03.680
Don't diss me, pa-pa.

33:03.714 --> 33:06.382
[Laughs] No idea.

33:06.417 --> 33:10.019
Could you tell me
what happened
during the operation?

33:11.955 --> 33:14.056
Well...

33:14.124 --> 33:16.992
The fact is, I did die
for a few minutes.

33:17.060 --> 33:19.562
[Monitor beeping]

33:19.630 --> 33:20.663
He's in cardiac arrest!

33:20.731 --> 33:22.531
It was amazing.
Doctor! His heart stopped!

33:22.600 --> 33:24.968
I could see and hear
everything,

33:25.036 --> 33:26.135
and nobody could see me.

33:26.203 --> 33:27.736
Do something!
We're losing him!

33:27.805 --> 33:29.072
No, please!

33:29.139 --> 33:31.274
Dr. Glassman
looked so stricken,

33:31.342 --> 33:33.109
so panicky.

33:33.143 --> 33:34.477
I wanted to tell him
I was fine.

33:34.545 --> 33:37.680
Heh, in fact,
I never felt better.

33:40.551 --> 33:42.786
Leave me alone,
leave me alone.
Leave me alone.

33:42.853 --> 33:46.121
Then I could see that
the doctor was in trouble.

33:46.189 --> 33:47.924
There was something
wrong with him.

33:51.128 --> 33:53.162
I tried calling to him,
to the other doctors,

33:53.164 --> 33:55.498
but of course,
no one could hear me.

33:55.565 --> 33:57.733

34:04.708 --> 34:06.742

had a heart attack

34:06.811 --> 34:08.745
in the hospital hallway.

34:08.812 --> 34:10.612
He died within seconds.

34:13.050 --> 34:14.684
[Monitor beeping]
Woman: He's back!

34:14.752 --> 34:16.385
They were able
to bring me back.

34:16.454 --> 34:17.786
[Indistinct chattering]

34:17.822 --> 34:20.556
I was dead
for 3 full minutes--
so they told me.

34:20.623 --> 34:21.824
To me, it seemed
like a split second.

34:21.891 --> 34:25.795
Tracy, call Dr. grey!
Or maybe a lifetime.

34:25.929 --> 34:28.630
I decided that day
I'd never waste
another second,

34:28.699 --> 34:30.032
learn everything
I could,

34:30.134 --> 34:32.301
go everywhere I could.

34:32.335 --> 34:33.936
Teach.

34:34.004 --> 34:37.273
Live a full life.

34:37.340 --> 34:41.443
But...
I always felt guilty.

34:41.511 --> 34:43.045
I had a second chance
at life,

34:43.114 --> 34:45.648
and Dr. Glassman
lost his.

34:45.715 --> 34:48.150
I thought
if only he'd known
I could be revived,

34:48.217 --> 34:49.818
maybe he wouldn't have had
his heart attack.

34:49.820 --> 34:51.954
How come you never
told me this?

34:51.989 --> 34:52.987
Ahh.

34:53.056 --> 34:54.989
Past has a way
of slowing you down.

34:55.058 --> 34:56.492
Who needs it?

34:58.295 --> 35:00.796
Well, sometimes,
the past can teach us.

35:00.865 --> 35:03.733
Did they ever find out
what happened?

35:03.767 --> 35:05.568
Did Dr. Glassman
make a mistake?

35:05.636 --> 35:06.769
I don't think
they ever...

35:06.836 --> 35:08.771
Fully understood why
I went into arrest,

35:08.838 --> 35:09.972
but, uh,

35:10.040 --> 35:12.641
cardiac surgery
was in its infancy.

35:12.709 --> 35:14.810
I'll tell you
one thing for sure--

35:14.878 --> 35:17.246
Dr. Glassman
fixed the hole
in my heart.

35:17.314 --> 35:20.616
I'm alive today
because of
what he did.

35:20.684 --> 35:23.086
Looks like
you had a great life.

35:23.154 --> 35:24.720
Still having it.

35:24.855 --> 35:27.122
Would you mind
waiting here for me?

35:27.258 --> 35:29.659

Congratulations, you guys.

35:46.510 --> 35:48.544

Oh! Hi.

36:00.425 --> 36:01.290
Hi.

36:01.358 --> 36:03.326
I see you got
the gift.

36:03.393 --> 36:04.593
Yes.

36:05.963 --> 36:07.763
Look, um...

36:07.798 --> 36:10.132
I can't say
what happened at lento's

36:10.200 --> 36:12.101
still doesn't bother me
a little bit,

36:12.169 --> 36:14.704
and I'm not really big
on second chances,

36:14.738 --> 36:18.908
but at the end of the day,
anyone this persistent

36:18.976 --> 36:20.576
deserves a second chance.

36:20.644 --> 36:23.379
You lost me
at persistent.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.980
What? I--

36:25.048 --> 36:27.349
I don't know
what you mean.

36:27.417 --> 36:32.020
The gifts, the notes,
the, um, the mime?

36:32.089 --> 36:33.656
Mimes creep me out.

36:33.724 --> 36:36.091
Oh. So, um...

36:36.159 --> 36:38.794
You didn't do
any of that stuff?

36:38.929 --> 36:41.130
Well, no.
I mean...

36:41.265 --> 36:42.798
You didn't
return my calls,

36:42.866 --> 36:45.034
I got the message.
You know.

36:45.102 --> 36:46.902
I moved on.

36:47.004 --> 36:50.039
Oh, I just noticed
there was a box in there
with your name on it

36:50.107 --> 36:53.108
when I was picking up
my coffee just now,
so...

36:53.176 --> 36:56.746
Uh, I, uh--
I gotta run.

36:56.814 --> 36:57.846
Take care.

36:57.914 --> 36:59.982
Yeah. You, too.

37:15.632 --> 37:18.734
"Roses are red,
violets are blue,

37:18.802 --> 37:20.569
"I can't hide
my feelings,

37:20.637 --> 37:23.339
that's why I keep
spilling things on you."

37:37.888 --> 37:39.088
You?

37:42.459 --> 37:46.562
It is just that
since the first time
I saw you,

37:46.630 --> 37:50.666
and for months now,
every time I try
to talk to you,

37:50.701 --> 37:52.434
or do something
to impress you,

37:52.502 --> 37:54.403
I--I get nervous.

37:54.471 --> 37:57.573
So I mess it all up.

37:57.641 --> 38:01.244
You were on the rooftop
with the flowers?

38:01.311 --> 38:04.613
I know. I must
come across like
a total buffalo.

38:04.715 --> 38:06.415
A buffoon?

38:06.483 --> 38:08.684
Yes. Yes,
thank you,
a buffoon.

38:08.819 --> 38:11.387
And if I had
to do it all over,

38:11.455 --> 38:13.989
I would definitely
rethink the mime.

38:14.024 --> 38:17.159
[Laughs]
But still, I--

38:17.227 --> 38:19.928
I have to keep
trying with you.

38:20.030 --> 38:22.799
Because the truth is,

38:22.866 --> 38:25.634
whenever
I see you smile,

38:25.702 --> 38:27.703
it makes me forget

38:27.738 --> 38:30.606
whatever I'm saying.

38:30.674 --> 38:32.641
Whatever
I'm thinking.

38:32.709 --> 38:34.310
Even what I'm doing.

38:37.647 --> 38:39.281
How can I ignore this?

38:43.587 --> 38:45.854
[Exhales]

38:45.923 --> 38:48.357
[Ticking]

38:48.424 --> 38:49.691
Melinda: If I use this
to bring him here,

38:49.760 --> 38:53.028
it might break him out
of his ghost loop.

38:53.096 --> 38:55.832
What are we doing?

38:55.899 --> 38:57.967
You're about
to meet Dr. Glassman.

38:58.035 --> 39:01.003
Dr. Glassman: Suction,
where's the suction?

39:01.071 --> 39:02.638
He's here.

39:10.481 --> 39:12.547
Who are you?

39:12.615 --> 39:14.183
Where's my patient?

39:14.251 --> 39:16.118
This is your patient.

39:16.186 --> 39:17.419
Bill Jett.

39:18.822 --> 39:20.589
He survived
the operation.

39:20.690 --> 39:22.492
You didn't
cause his death.

39:22.559 --> 39:24.793
No.

39:24.861 --> 39:27.296
This isn't my patient.

39:27.330 --> 39:29.131
No, that's his grandson.

39:29.166 --> 39:32.067
This is your patient.
[Chuckles]

39:33.137 --> 39:34.970
No.

39:35.005 --> 39:38.440
My patient is
just a boy.

39:38.508 --> 39:40.176
Yes.

39:40.244 --> 39:41.643
He was 50 years ago.

39:41.711 --> 39:44.347
But he survived.

39:44.414 --> 39:46.749
And he's right here.

39:46.817 --> 39:50.052
You've been stuck here
this whole time trying
to make it right.

39:50.120 --> 39:52.021
No, I killed him.
I made a mistake.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.722
He's saying
that he killed you.

39:53.790 --> 39:55.223
Oh, no, doc.

39:55.291 --> 39:57.392
Can he hear me?

39:57.460 --> 39:59.461
No, doc,
you saved me.

39:59.563 --> 40:00.963
But you had
a heart attack

40:01.031 --> 40:02.965
and died
before you knew.

40:03.033 --> 40:05.368
That's right.
I died.

40:05.435 --> 40:06.769
And I died a failure.

40:06.837 --> 40:10.372
I couldn't figure out
what I did wrong.

40:10.440 --> 40:13.609
Dr. Glassman, I died
for a few minutes,

40:13.677 --> 40:16.512
but they were able
to restart my heart,

40:16.613 --> 40:18.213
the heart you fixed.

40:19.483 --> 40:21.650
I lived.

40:21.718 --> 40:23.185
You didn't kill him.

40:23.253 --> 40:25.388
You saved him.

40:25.422 --> 40:27.256
I saved him?

40:27.357 --> 40:29.258
Yes.

40:29.326 --> 40:32.594
Look at
these pictures.

40:34.298 --> 40:37.132
His family,
his kids,

40:37.201 --> 40:41.137
his...
Brilliant grandson.

40:43.073 --> 40:45.975
Look at all the accomplishments
he had as a teacher.

40:46.042 --> 40:49.512
Look at all the accomplishments
of his students.

40:49.579 --> 40:54.316
Look at all the love
and the joy in these pictures.

40:54.384 --> 40:56.552
Look at all the things
that are in the world

40:56.619 --> 40:59.355
because Bill Jett
is in the world,

40:59.422 --> 41:03.626
because you held his heart
in your hands,

41:03.693 --> 41:06.829
and you fixed it.

41:06.897 --> 41:08.631
He's not wasted one minute.

41:08.732 --> 41:11.867
You gave him
a second chance.

41:11.935 --> 41:13.702
And by giving him
that second chance,

41:13.770 --> 41:18.341
you've given everybody else
in his life a first chance.

41:18.441 --> 41:20.943
Doctor,
you have no reason
to feel guilty.

41:21.011 --> 41:22.778
I'm the one
who feels bad.

41:22.812 --> 41:23.912
Because of what
happened to me,

41:23.980 --> 41:25.080
you had
a heart attack.

41:25.148 --> 41:27.283
No, no, it wasn't
your fault.

41:27.351 --> 41:30.119
My heart was in bad shape,
it was just a matter of time.

41:30.186 --> 41:31.554
He doesn't want you
to feel guilty.

41:31.622 --> 41:33.689
His heart
was in bad shape.

41:33.790 --> 41:35.891
So he can hear me,
right?

41:36.026 --> 41:38.827
Yes.

41:38.929 --> 41:41.497
I just want to say...

41:41.564 --> 41:42.798
Thanks.

41:42.866 --> 41:45.600
Thanks for giving me
my grandfather.

41:46.603 --> 41:48.303
I never realized

41:48.372 --> 41:51.040
how lucky I was
to come from him.

41:54.244 --> 41:56.545
He seems like
a nice kid.

41:56.580 --> 41:58.314
Why is he dressed
like a thug?

41:58.381 --> 41:59.415
[Laughs]

41:59.482 --> 42:02.451
Oh, it's
a long story.

42:25.409 --> 42:27.042
He's crossing over now.

42:29.512 --> 42:31.080
He's gone.
