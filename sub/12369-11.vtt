WEBVTT

00:02.460 --> 00:04.086
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:04.170 --> 00:07.257
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.384
- OH!
WELL, THIS ISN'T SO BAD.

00:09.467 --> 00:12.262
- HMM.
IT HAS A CERTAIN RUSTIC CHARM.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.805
- IT'S HONEST
AND UNPRETENTIOUS.

00:13.888 --> 00:17.183
- IT'S A DUMP.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.769
- IT LOOKS EXACTLY
LIKE I REMEMBER IT

00:19.853 --> 00:21.813
WHEN YOU AND I USED
TO COME HERE ON VACATION

00:21.896 --> 00:24.232
WITH OUR HUSBANDS.

00:24.315 --> 00:27.902
IT WAS A DUMP THEN TOO.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.739
- BACK THEN, IT WAS CALLED
"CAMP SHADY PINES."

00:30.822 --> 00:34.576
- WELL, NOW IT'S "CAMP SHADY
PINES SPA AND ASHRAM."

00:34.659 --> 00:37.454
- AND I HAVE GOT TO FIT
IN THAT DRESS THAT ALEC GAVE ME.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.289
WHY DID I SAY I WAS
A SIZE ZERO?

00:39.372 --> 00:42.917
ZERO?

00:43.001 --> 00:44.794
- WELL, AFTER THREE DAYS
ON A JUICE FAST,

00:44.878 --> 00:46.463
WE'RE ALL
GONNA LOSE WEIGHT,

00:46.546 --> 00:49.048
AND ALL FOR 120 BUCKS
A NIGHT.

00:49.132 --> 00:52.385
IN L.A., YOU CAN'T STARVE
FOR UNDER A THOUSAND.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.762
- GWYNETH PALTROW SAYS YOU
FORGET ABOUT FOOD

00:53.845 --> 00:55.638
AFTER THE FIRST 48 HOURS,

00:55.722 --> 00:58.349
SO I DID A PRE-FAST
FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.477
AND HOUR 49?

01:00.560 --> 01:02.979
I COULD EAT GWYNETH PALTROW
RIGHT NOW.

01:03.062 --> 01:04.938
- I DON'T MIND THE FASTING,

01:05.022 --> 01:08.610
BUT DO WE HAVE
TO DO ALL THE HIPPIE STUFF?

01:08.693 --> 01:10.820
I'M JUST HERE
TO LOSE A FEW POUNDS.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.948
- [laughs] AT YOUR AGE,
WHO CARES?

01:17.577 --> 01:20.955
- RIGHT BACK AT YA.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.636
{\an8}- I DIDN'T SLEEP
AT ALL LAST NIGHT.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.471
{\an8}I KEPT HEARING BEARS.

01:36.554 --> 01:40.683
{\an8}- OH, I'M SORRY, I THINK THAT
WAS MY STOMACH GROWLING.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.353
{\an8}- NO, IT WAS OUTSIDE
GOING THROUGH THE TRASH BINS.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.438
{\an8}- I THOUGHT I MIGHT
FIND A SCRAP OF SOMETHING.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.359
{\an8}- WELCOME, SEEKERS.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.486
{\an8}I'M YOGI ANANDA,

01:51.569 --> 01:53.363
{\an8}AND I AM HONORED
TO BE YOUR GUIDE.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.573
{\an8}NOW, TO BEGIN,
REMOVE YOUR CLOTHING

01:55.657 --> 01:59.828
{\an8}AND GENTLY TOUCH EACH OTHER.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.497
{\an8}- WHAT?

02:02.580 --> 02:04.833
{\an8}NO, NO, NO, NO.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.418
{\an8}- AREN'T YOU HERE
FOR THE ROMANCE PACKAGE?

02:07.502 --> 02:09.169
{\an8}- WE'RE FIVE WOMEN.

02:09.253 --> 02:12.549
{\an8}- AND WE ARE NON-JUDGMENTAL.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.217
{\an8}- ACTUALLY, YOGI,
WE'RE HERE

02:14.300 --> 02:16.511
{\an8}FOR THE "GIRLS GONE HUNGRY"
PACKAGE.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.346
{\an8}AND YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT THE THREE OF US

02:18.429 --> 02:20.723
{\an8}HAVE HAD OUR CHAKRAS ALIGNED,
KNOW OUR SPIRIT ANIMALS,

02:20.807 --> 02:22.475
{\an8}AND HAVE BEEN
PAST-LIFE REGRESSED.

02:22.559 --> 02:26.354
{\an8}- LET ME GUESS.
YOU'RE FROM L.A.

02:26.437 --> 02:31.317
{\an8}- THEY MOVED HERE
TO GET LAID.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.112
{\an8}- IN CLEVELAND,
WE DO THINGS A LITTLE SIMPLER.

02:34.195 --> 02:37.365
{\an8}LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING
THAT THIS IS A SAFE

02:37.448 --> 02:39.200
{\an8}AND A SACRED PLACE.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.911
{\an8}- USED TO BE
THE PING-PONG ROOM.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.746
{\an8}- EVEN IN THE BEST
OF FRIENDSHIPS,

02:43.830 --> 02:45.540
{\an8}THERE ARE SECRETS,
RESENTMENTS,

02:45.623 --> 02:47.917
{\an8}THINGS WE ARE AFRAID TO SAY.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.545
{\an8}- OH, NOT US.
- WE TELL EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.

02:50.628 --> 02:55.091
- I HAVE SOMETHING.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.926
I HAVE BEEN TAKING A CLASS
AT SCHOOL

02:57.010 --> 02:59.220
THAT I'M FINDING
REALLY FASCINATING,

02:59.304 --> 03:00.597
AND I WANT
TO MAKE IT MY CAREER,

03:00.680 --> 03:02.390
BUT I HAVEN'T MENTIONED IT

03:02.473 --> 03:04.392
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID
OF BEING MOCKED.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.394
- IN THIS ROOM,
WE TALK FROM THE HEART

03:06.477 --> 03:10.732
AND WE LISTEN
FROM THE HEART.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.567
- I'M MAJORING
IN CRIMINOLOGY

03:12.650 --> 03:15.612
BECAUSE I WANT
TO BE A PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.658
I SAW THAT LOOK.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.452
THAT'S THE LOOK YOU AND I
GIVE EACH OTHER

03:22.535 --> 03:23.453
WHEN VICTORIA
SAYS SOMETHING CRAZY.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.538
- WHAT?

03:25.622 --> 03:28.958
- YOU'RE GONNA SOLVE CRIMES LIKE
<i>MURDER, SHE WROTE?</i>

03:29.042 --> 03:30.752
- NO, NOT LIKE
<i>MURDER, SHE WROTE.</i>

03:30.835 --> 03:33.254
REAL CASES,
REAL SITUATIONS.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.340
- IT'S FUNNY.

03:35.423 --> 03:40.803
EVERYWHERE <i> MURDER, SHE WROTE</i>
WENT, SOMEONE DIED.

03:40.887 --> 03:45.391
I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE
INVITED HER TO PARTIES.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.018
- WELL, JOY,
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

03:47.101 --> 03:49.103
IT DOES SOUND A LITTLE
OUT THERE.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.813
- YEAH, AND ISN'T IT A LITTLE,
I DON'T KNOW, SEEDY?

03:50.897 --> 03:52.482
- OH, THANKS
FOR YOUR NONSUPPORT.

03:52.565 --> 03:53.775
- THIS IS WONDERFUL
NEGATIVITY.

03:53.858 --> 03:57.153
LET THE POISON OUT.

03:57.236 --> 03:59.656
- WELL, I GUESS IF
WE'RE LETTING THINGS OUT,

03:59.739 --> 04:02.116
I NOTICED
WHEN WE CHECKED IN

04:02.200 --> 04:05.662
THAT YOU TWO PUT EACH OTHER DOWN
AS YOUR EMERGENCY CONTACTS.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.789
WHY NOT ME?

04:07.872 --> 04:09.540
- HONEY, YOU'RE JUST NOT
THAT GREAT IN AN EMERGENCY.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.334
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:11.417 --> 04:13.127
- WHEN I WAS IN LABOR
WITH JENNA,

04:13.211 --> 04:14.963
AND WE WERE DRIVING
TO THE HOSPITAL,

04:15.046 --> 04:16.964
YOU STOPPED
AND BOUGHT A BAG AT GUCCI.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.676
- IT WAS 60% OFF, AND YOU
WERE ONLY 20% DILATED.

04:19.759 --> 04:23.012
WE BOTH BROUGHT HOME BUNDLES
OF JOY.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.681
- IT'S YOUR TURN, MELANIE.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.516
IS THERE A SECRET
OR RESENTMENT

04:26.599 --> 04:28.518
YOU WISH TO RELEASE
TO THE UNIVERSE?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.979
- GWYNETH PALTROW'S
A [bleep] LIAR.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.527
- I MEANT
WITH PRESENT COMPANY.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.696
- OH, NO, I HAVE NOTHING
TO RESENT THEM FOR.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.155
THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST
WITH ME,

04:41.239 --> 04:44.492
AND I TRUST THEM COMPLETELY.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.202
WHAT?
WHAT WAS THAT LOOK?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.162
- THAT'S THE LOOK THEY
GIVE EACH OTHER

04:48.246 --> 04:51.457
WHEN THEY HAVE A SECRET
THAT YOU CAN'T HANDLE.

04:51.541 --> 04:52.709
- THERE'S A SECRET?
WHAT SECRET?

04:52.792 --> 04:54.794
- IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.546
I DIDN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE
I DIDN'T WANNA HURT YOU,

04:56.629 --> 04:58.506
AND, NOW,
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.675
- SO, TELL ME THEN.
- VICTORIA, REMEMBER.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.552
YOU'RE HERE
TO DEEPEN YOUR FRIENDSHIP,

05:02.635 --> 05:05.722
AND FRIENDSHIP
IS BASED ON TRUTH.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.433
- JUST TELL ME.
- OKAY.

05:08.516 --> 05:12.228
IT'S ABOUT ANDERS.
THAT WAS HER EX-HUSBAND.

05:12.311 --> 05:14.689
HE HIT ON ME WHEN YOU TWO
WERE STILL MARRIED.

05:14.772 --> 05:16.566
- WHAT?

05:16.649 --> 05:18.735
HE HIT ON YOU
AND YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING?

05:18.818 --> 05:19.736
WHAT KIND OF FRIEND
DOES THAT?

05:19.819 --> 05:21.738
- A FRIEND LIKE JOY.

05:21.821 --> 05:25.533
HE HIT ON HER FIRST
AND SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.410
- WAY TO SELL ME OUT,
VICTORIA.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.287
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TWO
DIDN'T TELL ME!

05:29.370 --> 05:31.080
GOD, HE HIT ON BOTH OF YOU

05:31.164 --> 05:32.749
AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW?

05:32.832 --> 05:34.834
AM I REALLY THAT BLIND?

05:34.917 --> 05:36.711
I MEAN, WAS HE JUST HITTING
ON ANYTHING THAT MOVED?

05:36.794 --> 05:39.881
- SOUNDS LIKE IT.

05:43.134 --> 05:46.763
- I'M GLAD YOU AND I
DON'T HAVE THIS KIND OF DRAMA.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.598
- ELKA BOSSES ME AROUND

05:48.681 --> 05:52.477
AND MAKES ME DO STUFF
I DON'T WANNA DO.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.730
- YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

05:55.813 --> 05:59.776
- NO, I DON'T.

05:59.859 --> 06:03.321
[whispering]
YES, I DO.

06:03.404 --> 06:04.781
- I'M TOO HUNGRY TO SLEEP.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.075
- [sighs] ME TOO.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.118
I THINK I'M LOSING MY MIND.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.120
AN HOUR AGO,
I LOOKED AT VICTORIA'S ARM

06:11.204 --> 06:13.456
AND I THOUGHT
HOW DELICIOUS IT WOULD BE

06:13.539 --> 06:17.085
ROLLED IN BREAD CRUMBS
AND IN MARINARA.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.212
- I'M ALL ABOUT ELKA'S ARM.

06:19.295 --> 06:22.507
SHE'S BEEN MARINATING IN VODKA
FOR 50 YEARS.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.342
- [chuckles]

06:24.425 --> 06:26.302
- HAVE YOU TWO
ALREADY SAID YOUR SORRIES

06:26.385 --> 06:28.012
BECAUSE I WAS JUST COMING OUT
TO SAY MINE.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.598
- NO.
YOU'RE RIGHT ON TIME.

06:30.681 --> 06:32.642
I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS.
both: ME TOO.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.644
- I WANT TO BE
A RESPONSIBLE FRIEND

06:34.727 --> 06:36.979
THAT YOU CAN COUNT ON
IN EMERGENCIES.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.190
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT SETTING THE PLACE ON FIRE

06:39.273 --> 06:42.318
SO THAT I COULD SAVE
YOU ALL, BUT...

06:42.401 --> 06:44.195
YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST SO HARD

06:44.278 --> 06:47.365
TO GET THAT SMOKY SMELL
OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.825
- WE REALLY SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
ABOUT ANDERS.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.952
- OH, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.538
BUT I CAN BE SUCH AN IDIOT
ABOUT MEN,

06:53.621 --> 06:57.333
WHICH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
MAKES ME WONDER ABOUT ALEC.

06:57.416 --> 07:00.002
WHAT IF I'M AN IDIOT
WITH HIM?

07:00.086 --> 07:02.004
WHAT IF HE
BREAKS MY HEART TOO?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.339
- OH, HONEY, THAT'S A RISK
THAT WE ALL TAKE

07:03.422 --> 07:05.550
WHEN WE FALL IN LOVE.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.593
- NO, BUT I DON'T EVER WANNA
FEEL THAT KIND OF PAIN AGAIN.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.470
I MEAN, WHY AREN'T I JUST OUT
ENJOYING MYSELF,

07:09.554 --> 07:10.638
DATING A LOT OF MEN,
LIVING THE FANTASY,

07:10.721 --> 07:12.765
AND PROTECTING MY HEART?

07:12.849 --> 07:14.976
- WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU
DO DECIDE TO STAY WITH ALEC,

07:15.059 --> 07:18.729
YOU COULD HIRE JOY
TO TAIL HIM.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.692
- LOOK, I REALIZE ANNOUNCING

07:22.775 --> 07:24.026
THAT I WANT
TO BE A PRIVATE EYE

07:24.110 --> 07:25.987
SOUNDS A LITTLE SKETCHY,

07:26.070 --> 07:28.698
BUT WITH MY NATURAL DISTRUST
OF HUMAN NATURE,

07:28.781 --> 07:31.534
I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING I
COULD REALLY SINK MY TEETH INTO.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.537
- [chuckles] I COULD SINK MY
TEETH INTO ANYTHING RIGHT NOW,

07:34.620 --> 07:36.372
AND I CAN'T EVEN DISTRACT MYSELF
WITH TV.

07:36.455 --> 07:38.249
IT'S TUESDAY NIGHT.

07:38.332 --> 07:39.584
I SHOULD BE WATCHING
<i>MILLION DOLLAR ROOMS</i>

07:39.667 --> 07:40.877
WITH CARTER OOSTERHOUSE.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.962
HE IS SO DREAMY,

07:43.045 --> 07:44.672
AND HE CAN INSTANTLY ESTIMATE
THE SQUARE FOOTAGE

07:44.755 --> 07:46.841
OF ANY ROOM HE WALKS INTO.

07:46.924 --> 07:50.761
- MY TV CRUSH
IS PETER DINKLAGE.

07:50.845 --> 07:54.682
YOU HEARD ME.
PETER DINKLAGE.

07:54.765 --> 07:59.145
I'D LIKE HIM TO SCALE ME
LIKE A MOUNTAINEER.

07:59.228 --> 08:02.356
- WELL, WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO USE NATURE'S TV:

08:02.440 --> 08:05.860
PEEPING INTO
OTHER PEOPLE'S WINDOWS.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.570
[sighs]

08:07.653 --> 08:09.113
SOMEONE GOT
THE ROMANCE PACKAGE.

08:09.197 --> 08:12.283
THEY'RE DANCING.

08:12.366 --> 08:15.828
AT LEAST, I <i> THINK</i>
THEY'RE DANCING.

08:15.912 --> 08:20.917
WHAT IS HE DOING
WITH HIS HANDS AROUND HER NECK?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.586
OH, MY GOD!
HE'S STRANGLING HER.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.838
- I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
- NEITHER DO I.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.882
- WELL, I DID.
CALL THE POLICE!

08:27.965 --> 08:29.759
- HOW? WE TURNED IN OUR PHONES
WHEN WE CHECKED IN.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.552
- I'LL DO IT.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.638
I NEVER LEAVE HOME
WITHOUT A BURNER.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.937
- WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.813
- THE POLICE RANGER
IS AT THE DOOR.

08:42.897 --> 08:45.274
IT'S OPENING.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.693
OH, MY GOD!
- IS THAT THE YOGI?

08:47.777 --> 08:49.111
- YES.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.821
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.907
WE GO ON A SMALL,
RUSTIC RETREAT,

08:52.990 --> 08:54.825
AND THE PERSON IN CHARGE
IS A MURDERER!

08:54.909 --> 08:58.496
- AND YOU SAY YOU'RE NOT
<i>MURDER, SHE WROTE?</i>

08:58.579 --> 09:00.414
- WAIT.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.833
THE RANGER AND YOGI
ARE COMING BACK OUT.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.503
THEY'RE SHAKING HANDS.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.463
THE RANGER
IS LETTING YOGI GO.

09:07.546 --> 09:09.423
- MM, STOP SAYING
"THE RANGER" AND "YOGI."

09:09.507 --> 09:11.842
IT'S MAKING ME THINK
ABOUT PIC-A-NIC BASKETS.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.803
- THE RANGER IS COMING OVER,

09:13.886 --> 09:15.930
AND HE'S GOT SOME EXPLAINING
TO DO.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.306
- I'M NERVOUS.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.308
I USED TO LOVE COPS,

09:19.392 --> 09:21.143
AND, NOW, THANKS TO YOU
AND OUR LITTLE BUSINESS,

09:21.227 --> 09:23.145
THEY MAKE ME NERVOUS.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.314
- HE'S NOT COMING FOR US.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.649
JUST STAY COOL.

09:26.732 --> 09:27.984
- I'VE NEVER BEEN COOL.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.195
HOW CAN I STAY COOL?

09:31.279 --> 09:33.531
- GOOD POINT.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.828
- EVENING, LADIES.
I'M RANGER MURPHY.

09:38.911 --> 09:44.041
- OH, MY GOD!

09:44.125 --> 09:46.210
AM I LOSING MY MIND,

09:46.294 --> 09:48.462
OR DOES THAT RANGER LOOK
EXACTLY LIKE CARTER OOSTERHOUSE?

09:48.546 --> 09:50.339
- YOU'RE LOSING YOUR MIND.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.049
HE LOOKS NOTHING
LIKE CARTER OOSTERHOUSE.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.010
- WHY DIDN'T YOU ARREST
THAT MURDERER?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.845
- BECAUSE HE'S NOT A MURDERER.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.805
LOOK, WE GET THESE CALLS
ALL THE TIME.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.932
WOMEN COME TO THE RETREAT,
STARVE THEMSELVES,

10:00.016 --> 10:02.810
AND, A COUPLE DAYS LATER,
THEY START SEEING THINGS.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.854
- HE REALLY DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE CARTER OOSTERHOUSE TO YOU?

10:04.937 --> 10:07.023
- NO! HE LOOKS LIKE
EVERY OTHER GUY IN CLEVELAND.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.066
- [exhales]
I MUST BE HAVING A STROKE.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.027
WAIT, SHOULDN'T I
BE SMELLING TOAST?

10:11.110 --> 10:13.821
OH, I WOULD REALLY
LOVE SOME TOAST RIGHT NOW.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.698
- HERE YOU ARE,

10:15.781 --> 10:17.033
AND DON'T THINK I'M GOING
TO LET THIS GO.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.909
I'M A CRIMINOLOGY MAJOR.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.871
- OH, BOY.

10:21.954 --> 10:22.997
MY ADVICE?
TRY TO RELAX.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.999
BOOK YOURSELF A MASSAGE.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.042
I HEAR THE GUY HERE
IS EXCELLENT.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.002
NIGHT, LADIES.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.046
- YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS HAVE
ONE OF THE NICER UNITS HERE.

10:30.129 --> 10:34.258
THIS LOOKS TO BE
ABOUT 1,400 SQUARE FEET.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.218
- COME ON!
HE EVEN <i> TALKS</i> LIKE HIM.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.345
- MELANIE,
YOU'RE HALLUCINATING,

10:37.428 --> 10:38.554
JUST LIKE JOY.

10:38.637 --> 10:40.556
IT'S THE LACK OF FOOD.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.850
- I WAS NOT HALLUCINATING.
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

10:42.933 --> 10:44.852
- AND BECAUSE BOTH
OF YOUR DISASSOCIATIONS

10:44.935 --> 10:47.188
WITH REALITY COULD BE
CONSIDERED AN EMERGENCY,

10:47.271 --> 10:50.274
I FULLY SUPPORT WHATEVER
YOU BELIEVE YOU SAW.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.693
AND NOW, I NEED TO GO
AND LIE DOWN.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.445
THOSE THINGS I FOUND
ON THE FLOOR

10:54.528 --> 10:56.572
I THOUGHT WERE CHEERIOS
WERE BUTTONS.

11:07.792 --> 11:08.959
- THERE YOU ARE.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.087
IT'S TIME FOR TAI CHI

11:11.170 --> 11:15.424
AND THEY'RE
SERVING CHAI TEA.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.093
- I WISH IT WAS TIME
FOR ORANGE JUICE

11:17.176 --> 11:19.929
AND THEY WERE SERVING VODKA.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.934
- THE OTHER GIRLS
SAID THEIR SORRIES,

11:25.017 --> 11:27.103
BUT WE DIDN'T.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.896
- DON'T WORRY.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.773
YOU SAID I WAS BOSSY.
YOU WERE WRONG.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.943
I FORGIVE YOU.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.403
- YOU ARE BOSSY.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.780
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN BOSSY.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.782
WHEN WE USED TO COME HERE,
YOU MADE ME DO

11:39.865 --> 11:43.077
ALL KINDS OF THINGS
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.580
- IS THIS THE JACKIE O.
HAIRCUT THING AGAIN?

11:46.664 --> 11:48.124
- IT DIDN'T SUIT ME AT ALL.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.126
YOU KNOW WHAT WORKS FOR ME.

11:50.209 --> 11:55.131
PARTY IN THE FRONT,
ALL BUSINESS IN THE BACK.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.134
BUT WHAT YOU'VE GOTTEN ME
INTO NOW IS THE LAST STRAW.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.469
- WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE!

12:00.553 --> 12:02.680
- YES, BUT IT'S ILLEGAL,

12:02.763 --> 12:05.015
AND I'M STOPPING RIGHT NOW.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.977
I'M GIVING BACK
ALL MY FAKE I.D.s.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.980
I WILL MISS ALL THE FREE
BIRTHDAY MEALS AT DENNY'S

12:11.063 --> 12:13.566
THAT COME WITH THEM.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.026
- MAMIE, SO, IF YOU WALK OUT
THAT DOOR,

12:16.110 --> 12:20.114
THERE'S NO COMING BACK.

12:20.197 --> 12:23.242
[door closes]

12:25.202 --> 12:27.496
[door opens]

12:27.580 --> 12:30.040
- SO, ARE WE READY?

12:30.124 --> 12:34.003
- [gasps]

12:34.086 --> 12:36.505
OH, MY GOD, IT'S YOU!

12:36.589 --> 12:37.965
OR AM I IMAGINING AGAIN?

12:38.048 --> 12:42.178
- NO, IT'S ME.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.013
- BEING A RANGER IN A SMALL TOWN
DOESN'T PAY MUCH,

12:44.096 --> 12:48.350
SO I'M A PART-TIME MASSEUR
TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.895
- SO YOU READY
FOR MY MAGIC HANDS?

12:50.978 --> 12:53.022
- OH.
[chuckles]

12:53.105 --> 12:55.024
IT'S JUST THE WAY YOU LOOK,
AND ME LYING HERE NAKED.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.401
IT'S KIND OF A FANTASY
OF MINE.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.820
- WOW.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.698
I DON'T HEAR THAT EVERY DAY...

13:02.781 --> 13:06.994
OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY,
EVER.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.371
- CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND LET ME DO WHAT I DO.

13:09.455 --> 13:13.083
- OKAY.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.543
- HOW'S THE PRESSURE?

13:14.627 --> 13:16.378
- OH, GREAT.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.588
I'M SORRY
ABOUT MY STOMACH GROWLING.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.507
I'M JUST SO HUNGRY.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.383
- WELL, THERE IS
A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA

13:21.467 --> 13:23.344
I'VE DONE BEFORE

13:23.427 --> 13:27.348
THAT MIGHT HELP YOU
RELIEVE THAT TENSION.

13:27.431 --> 13:31.769
- SOMETHING EXTRA?

13:31.852 --> 13:34.230
- YOU KNOW, A LOT OF WOMEN
ARE A LITTLE SKEPTICAL AT FIRST,

13:34.313 --> 13:37.358
BUT AFTERWARDS,
THEY'RE VERY GLAD THEY SAID YES.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.568
- OH, MY GOD.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.196
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WHAT
I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

13:42.279 --> 13:43.739
- I COULD GET YOU A PIZZA.

13:43.822 --> 13:46.742
- [exhales]

13:46.825 --> 13:49.078
I JUST KEPT MY FACE BURIED
IN THE MASSAGE TABLE HEADREST

13:49.161 --> 13:51.580
SO I WOULDN'T LOOK
AT HIM ANYMORE.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.416
OH, GOD,
HE HAS BEAUTIFUL FEET.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.878
- MELANIE, YOU SAID YOU POSED
A QUESTION TO THE UNIVERSE.

13:57.962 --> 14:01.048
SHOULD YOU GIVE YOUR HEART
TO ALEC AND RISK PAIN

14:01.131 --> 14:02.758
OR LIVE A FANTASY LIFE
FULL OF FUN AND PLEASURE?

14:02.841 --> 14:04.760
[chuckles]

14:04.843 --> 14:06.637
AND THE UNIVERSE
PROVIDED A PERFECT FANTASY.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.682
CLEARLY, YOUR PSYCHE
IS TESTING YOU.

14:09.765 --> 14:12.142
- OR AM I JUST SO HUNGRY,
I'M LOSING MY MIND?

14:12.226 --> 14:15.604
- BOTH THINGS CAN BE TRUE.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.315
- DUALITY IS
AN INTERESTING SUBJECT.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.485
FOR EXAMPLE,
A MAN CAN BE BOTH A YOGI

14:21.569 --> 14:24.613
AND THE SHADY PINES STRANGLER.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.575
- JOY, FOR THE THIRD TIME,
I DIDN'T STRANGLE ANYONE.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.785
JUST AS MELANIE
IS STRUGGLING WITH LOVE,

14:29.868 --> 14:31.620
YOU'RE STRUGGLING
WITH THIS NEW CAREER PATH,

14:31.704 --> 14:34.123
AND YOUR PSYCHE
HAS MANUFACTURED A CRIME

14:34.206 --> 14:36.250
YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO SOLVE.

14:36.333 --> 14:39.086
- OH, GOD.
THAT MAKES SENSE.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.921
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT MELANIE

14:41.005 --> 14:43.299
AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT ME TOO.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.134
I AM SO SORRY.
- I FORGIVE YOU.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.636
AND NOW, I LEAVE YOU ALL
TO YOUR SILENT MEDITATION.

14:53.183 --> 14:56.103
- WHAT A PILE OF CRAP.
HE IS SO GUILTY.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.354
I HAVE GOT TO GET
INTO HIS CABIN

14:57.438 --> 14:59.523
AND FIND SOME REAL EVIDENCE.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.567
I KNOW.

15:01.650 --> 15:02.818
VICTORIA, BOOK A PRIVATE SESSION
WITH HIM TONIGHT

15:02.901 --> 15:04.820
SO I CAN GET IN THERE.

15:04.903 --> 15:06.655
- SO YOU'RE TURNING TO ME
IN AN EMERGENCY.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.157
- ONLY BECAUSE MELANIE
HAS LOST HER MIND.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.326
- HEY!

15:10.409 --> 15:12.119
YEAH, THAT'S FAIR.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.759
- [gasps]

15:30.304 --> 15:32.389
[blow-up doll inflates]
SHH, SHH, SHH!

15:41.440 --> 15:43.150
- JOY!
I TOLD YOU TO KEEP YOUR NOSE

15:43.233 --> 15:44.234
OUT OF MY BUSINESS!

15:44.318 --> 15:46.528
- THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.155
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

15:48.238 --> 15:50.491
- LOOK, I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.035
I SAW YOU STRANGLING A WOMAN
WITH LONG, CURLY HAIR

15:53.118 --> 15:56.705
AND A HORRIFIED EXPRESSION.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.999
OH, DEAR.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.043
- I WASN'T STRANGLING HER.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.503
I WAS DEFLATING HER.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.046
- YOU'RE A YOGI.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.339
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME

16:05.422 --> 16:08.300
THAT YOU'D BE MANHANDLING
A SEX DOLL.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.386
- JOY, YOU GOTTA GET OUT
OF HERE.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.055
UH-OH.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.099
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO KEEP HIM BUSY.

16:15.182 --> 16:15.808
- WELL, I'M SORRY.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.060
I WAS ON MY WAY
TO MEET HIM,

16:18.143 --> 16:22.231
BUT THEN SOME FAN SPOTTED ME
AT THE FOUNTAIN OF SELFLESSNESS.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.024
WHAT'S WITH THE BLOW-UP DOLL?

16:24.108 --> 16:25.275
- OH, TURNS OUT
HE'S NOT A MURDERER.

16:25.359 --> 16:29.697
HE'S JUST A PERV.

16:29.780 --> 16:30.739
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:30.823 --> 16:31.865
- I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.909
YOU'RE SO INTERESTED
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM?

16:33.992 --> 16:35.953
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET
AN INSIDER'S VIEW.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.038
- OH, LET'S NOT BE HASTY.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.249
LISTEN.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.751
YOU KNOW YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR
THIS RINKY-DINK PLACE, RIGHT?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.837
- WELL, I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT
OF TAKING MY ASTRAL TALENTS

16:44.920 --> 16:45.963
TO SOUTH BEACH.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.424
- AND HOW ABOUT L.A.?

16:48.507 --> 16:51.385
I HAPPEN TO KNOW
A CERTAIN ONE-NAMED CELEBRITY,

16:51.468 --> 16:52.803
RHYMES WITH "CHER."

16:52.886 --> 16:54.847
WAIT, I SCREWED THAT UP.

16:54.930 --> 16:58.100
ANYWAY, SHE'S LOOKING
FOR A NEW PERSONAL GURU.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.144
SHE CAN HOOK YOU UP
WITH OTHER CRAZY ACTRESSES

17:00.227 --> 17:03.105
AND YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN
CELEBRITY ASHRAM IN MALIBU...

17:03.188 --> 17:05.523
[snaps fingers]
LIKE THAT.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.983
- WHAT DO YOU SAY, BABY?

17:07.067 --> 17:11.405
YOU LIKE THE BEACH.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.073
[knock at door]

17:18.537 --> 17:21.457
- HUNGRY?

17:24.376 --> 17:26.627
- ELKA?

17:26.712 --> 17:28.964
- I KNEW YOU'D COME
TO THE LAKE EVENTUALLY.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.468
- I GUESS I AM
KIND OF PREDICTABLE.

17:32.551 --> 17:36.847
- YOU'RE ALSO SWEET
AND GOOD AND MY BEST FRIEND.

17:36.930 --> 17:42.102
- YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND TOO.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.812
- YOU WANT OUT
OF OUR BUSINESS?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.063
YOU'RE OUT.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.273
- THANK YOU.

17:46.356 --> 17:49.651
I WANT BACK IN.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.737
- WHAT?

17:51.820 --> 17:54.615
- ON MY WAY HERE,
I SAW THE TREE I CRASHED INTO

17:54.698 --> 17:56.450
WHEN YOU MADE ME LEARN
HOW TO DRIVE,

17:56.533 --> 17:58.535
AND I PASSED BY
THAT OLD BURNT FOREST

17:58.619 --> 18:01.872
WHERE YOU TAUGHT ME
HOW TO SMOKE.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.541
I STILL HAVE TROUBLE
WITH CIGARS.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.836
- YOU GOTTA KEEP THE STUB WET.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.005
- AND I REALIZED THAT, YES,

18:10.088 --> 18:12.174
YOU PUSHED ME,

18:12.257 --> 18:13.509
BUT MAYBE I'M ONE
OF THOSE PEOPLE

18:13.592 --> 18:15.010
WHO NEEDS A GOOD PUSH.

18:15.093 --> 18:17.054
- [chuckles]

18:17.137 --> 18:19.223
LOOK AT US,

18:19.306 --> 18:21.517
HERE AT THE LAKE AGAIN.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.185
- FEELS LIKE OLD TIMES.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.355
- SPEAKING OF OLD TIMES...

18:26.438 --> 18:31.151
WHY DON'T WE TOAST THEM?

18:31.235 --> 18:33.070
- I AM SO SORRY ABOUT THAT.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.155
I GUESS I JUST GOT A LITTLE WEAK
IN THE KNEES.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.991
- MELANIE, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU ALL DAY.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.202
- I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU TOO.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.162
[sighs]
AND YOU'RE HERE,

18:42.246 --> 18:44.665
SO I GUESS THE UNIVERSE
IS TELLING ME

18:44.748 --> 18:47.960
THAT YOU'RE WHAT I WANT.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.419
I MEAN, I THINK.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.214
- HOW ABOUT WE STOP THINKING,

18:52.297 --> 18:55.175
AND I JUST DO THIS?

18:55.259 --> 18:56.176
- NO!

18:56.260 --> 18:57.553
NO, I DON'T WANT THIS.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.346
I DON'T WANT THIS FANTASY.

18:59.429 --> 19:01.265
ALEC IS MY FANTASY,

19:01.348 --> 19:03.725
AND HE'S THE ONLY ONE
I WANT RIGHT NOW.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.770
[gasps]

19:06.854 --> 19:08.397
ALEC!

19:08.480 --> 19:10.274
BUT IT CAN'T BE.
OH, WHO CARES?

19:13.694 --> 19:16.613
- WOW!

19:16.697 --> 19:18.073
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

19:18.156 --> 19:20.075
- I'M RANGER MURPHY,

19:20.158 --> 19:21.451
OR CARTER, OR ALEC.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.412
WHO DO YOU WANT ME TO BE?

19:23.495 --> 19:25.414
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE ANYONE.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.917
I MEAN, I'M SURE YOU'RE FINE
JUST WHO YOU ARE,

19:29.001 --> 19:31.086
BUT I DO WANNA THANK YOU

19:31.169 --> 19:34.131
FOR HELPING ME SEE THAT I NEVER
REALLY WANTED YOU AT ALL.

19:34.214 --> 19:36.967
- GOD, I HATE THIS PLACE.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.763
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE EATING PIZZA.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.474
- I PASSED THE UNIVERSE'S TEST
AND I'M CELEBRATING.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.643
- YEAH, I DON'T DESERVE
A SLICE.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.146
JOY WAS COUNTING ON ME
AND I SCREWED UP AGAIN.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.898
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

19:50.981 --> 19:52.900
I'D BE IN JAIL
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU.

19:52.983 --> 19:56.612
VICTORIA, YOU ARE A TERRIBLE
EMERGENCY CONTACT,

19:56.695 --> 19:58.655
BUT ONCE THE EMERGENCY
HAS HAPPENED,

19:58.739 --> 20:02.117
NO ONE CAN CHARM, BRIBE,
AND DIVA THEIR WAY

20:02.201 --> 20:03.619
OUT OF THE SITUATION
LIKE YOU CAN.

20:03.702 --> 20:04.995
- SHE'S RIGHT.

20:05.078 --> 20:07.039
- I AGREE WITH BOTH OF YOU.

20:07.122 --> 20:09.416
NOW HAND ME A SLICE.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.960
ELKA, WHAT DID YOU DO
TO DESERVE YOUR SLICE?

20:12.044 --> 20:14.671
- I'M 91 AND A LITTLE BUZZED.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.510
- ME TOO.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.180
HOW ABOUT WE GO
PICK UP SOME CUBANS?

20:26.558 --> 20:29.478
THE TRICK IS
TO KEEP THE STUBS WET.
