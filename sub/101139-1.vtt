WEBVTT

00:27.762 --> 00:29.531
They have to be focused.

00:29.564 --> 00:31.666
You have to really know
what you really want to be

00:31.699 --> 00:33.133
and what you really want to do.

00:34.301 --> 00:35.435
I think...

00:37.237 --> 00:38.372
it's just to have love.

00:39.741 --> 00:41.174
To have a family.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.278
Sir,
could you please not do that?

00:44.311 --> 00:47.080
I mean, figured getting
my picture in the paper.

00:47.114 --> 00:49.082
Yeah, I'mma be somebody.

00:49.116 --> 00:51.853
- They're going to see.
- Two cars for every garage.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.855
Hell yes, my friend.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.389
Two garages for every house.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.592
Hell, that's four cars all day.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.561
Oh, a beauty queen.

00:59.594 --> 01:02.296
Even a county fair beauty queen.
Any kind of beauty queen!

01:02.329 --> 01:04.096
It's kind of like
hunting a turkey.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.800
You got to line up the shot.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.570
Man, I'm just trying
to keep peace.

01:08.603 --> 01:10.304
At the end of the day,

01:10.337 --> 01:12.807
everybody deserves life,
liberty and...

01:12.840 --> 01:13.708
Bam!

01:15.475 --> 01:16.343
That's my dream.

01:18.846 --> 01:19.714
What's my...

01:21.448 --> 01:23.618
You know, man, uh,
all anybody's looking for

01:23.651 --> 01:25.653
is making something happen for
themselves, you know?

01:25.687 --> 01:28.255
Just a matter of finding
a place you can do that.

01:28.288 --> 01:29.824
Step one, make a plan.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.291
Step two...

01:31.325 --> 01:33.528
Come on now!
Quit your yappin' boy!

01:33.561 --> 01:35.429
Dream big, see what happens.

01:35.462 --> 01:37.331
Ladies and gentlemen,
we got a real

01:37.364 --> 01:38.566
opportunity here today!

01:38.600 --> 01:40.300
Not just the fight of the year

01:40.334 --> 01:41.869
but the wager of the century!

01:41.903 --> 01:45.405
- Now, I know you got debts, let's make some bets!
- Let's do it, yeah!

01:45.439 --> 01:48.710
In this corner,
we got Scottie The Wildman Aldo!

01:51.211 --> 01:52.814
Yeah, and more
importantly, in this corner,

01:52.847 --> 01:55.482
we got sharp as a tack
Lightning Jack!

02:01.556 --> 02:02.857
All right, yeah.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.192
Bet big or go home, woo!

02:05.225 --> 02:06.761
All right, folks,
all bets are final!

02:06.794 --> 02:08.763
This is for all the chili dogs!

02:22.677 --> 02:24.646
Get him again!

02:26.714 --> 02:28.549
Get him, get him!

02:33.655 --> 02:35.690
Get him, get him, get him!

02:40.528 --> 02:41.896
Yeah!

02:41.929 --> 02:43.765
Stick to the plan,
take the fall!

02:45.465 --> 02:47.434
Get him now!
Get him while he's down!

02:51.506 --> 02:53.975
Oh, he's down!

02:54.008 --> 02:56.878
Ladies and gentlemen, it was
a knock out! I mean, look!

02:56.911 --> 02:58.746
This, this man is dead!

02:58.780 --> 03:02.282
- Wait minute, wait a minute!
- Somebody call an ambulance!

03:02.315 --> 03:04.819
Give him some water! Everybody
back off, give him some room.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.187
I'm just, I'm just
going to go seek help!

03:09.824 --> 03:12.660
Hey, hey, get him!

03:12.694 --> 03:13.728
Hey!

03:13.761 --> 03:15.663
Hey!

03:22.469 --> 03:24.271
Did it again,
Jackie boy!

03:24.304 --> 03:25.907
Yeah, not bad!

03:25.940 --> 03:27.709
Hey, where's the cash?

03:27.742 --> 03:29.744
Aw, shit!

04:28.703 --> 04:31.539
If you think about it, you should be grabbing
the cash while they're looking at me.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.609
Look, it's nobody's fault you forgot
the cash and obliterated my cool plan.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.944
We're on to bigger
and better things.

04:43.851 --> 04:44.619
Hey, I just don't see

04:44.652 --> 04:46.621
why I always gotta
take the fall.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.989
All right, I'm listening.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.858
What if next time we do,
like, characters?

04:50.892 --> 04:52.960
You know,
like cowboys and Indians.

04:52.994 --> 04:54.729
That's the big time
that I'm talking about.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.363
Yeah, I like that, but I do feel

04:56.396 --> 04:57.532
like you're kind of missing
the point though,

04:57.565 --> 04:59.700
'cause I mean, that's just...
man, all this, all right,

04:59.734 --> 05:03.403
the scams, this, this job,
the suspiciously generous loans

05:03.436 --> 05:06.941
from the King. That's all just, uh, it's
a means to an end is what it is, you see?

05:06.974 --> 05:09.577
'Cause step one,
I got my car up and running,

05:09.610 --> 05:11.646
which brings us to step two.
We just raise a little more money

05:11.679 --> 05:13.114
to put some gas
money in said car,

05:13.147 --> 05:14.615
which brings us promptly
on to step three,

05:14.649 --> 05:15.817
which is someday,
and someday soon, my friend,

05:15.850 --> 05:18.085
you and me are going to be.

05:18.119 --> 05:22.056
Uh-huh. You know You've been saying
that since we were 12 years old, Jack.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.958
Except nobody ever gets
out of here, do they?

05:26.459 --> 05:27.995
Ah, that's not entirely true.

05:28.029 --> 05:29.831
My... my mama made it
out of here.

05:29.864 --> 05:32.900
Yeah, but your mama wasn't
drowning in debt to King George.

05:32.934 --> 05:35.002
Well.

05:35.036 --> 05:38.471
If it ain't my two favorite dishwashers!

05:38.506 --> 05:39.874
How we doing, boys?

05:39.907 --> 05:40.808
Let me see them winnings! Huh?

05:40.842 --> 05:42.009
Well, you know it's
a funny thing, Mack...

05:42.043 --> 05:44.745
It is a funny thing 'cause
I'm going to be able to pay off

05:44.779 --> 05:46.547
the King and have
enough money left over

05:46.581 --> 05:47.949
for the Fourth of July!

05:47.982 --> 05:50.483
Get those big old
rockets loud as hell!

05:50.518 --> 05:53.386
You know what, hell,
you boys are invited!

05:53.420 --> 05:57.024
We'll get shit-faced and piss
of the neighbors!

05:57.058 --> 05:59.492
You see uh, uh,
about that, Mack,

05:59.527 --> 06:02.697
we had like a little bit
of an issue with the money.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.066
"Sure thing," you told me!

06:05.099 --> 06:08.703
"Not to worry, we're gonna double
your money!" That's what you said!

06:08.736 --> 06:10.838
Well, no, Mack,
I believe what I said was...

06:10.872 --> 06:12.139
No, I know what you said!

06:12.173 --> 06:14.742
You said, "I got a plan, man!"

06:14.775 --> 06:16.010
Oh shit, all right,
calm down now.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.979
- We're gonna pay you back, all right?
- That's horse shit!

06:18.012 --> 06:20.147
And I'm going to take
it out your paychecks!

06:20.181 --> 06:21.983
Hey, hey,
let's just talk about this!

06:22.016 --> 06:23.751
Ain't going to talk your
way out of nothing!

06:23.784 --> 06:26.687
I'm docking your paychecks
for a month, you understand me?

06:26.721 --> 06:29.056
You lazy white trash!

06:29.090 --> 06:31.626
Hey! I'm a quarter of Apache.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.027
Three months!

06:34.996 --> 06:37.698
Oh yeah? Goddammit!

06:37.732 --> 06:39.432
Man, we can barely afford
to eat as it is, man!

06:39.466 --> 06:41.669
Well, eat this, you egg sucking,

06:41.702 --> 06:43.971
trailer park weasel,
ass-licking.

06:48.743 --> 06:50.811
<i>Let's take
a moment of refuge to...</i>

06:56.817 --> 06:57.718
The... the King?

06:58.953 --> 07:00.521
<i>Tell you what, folks,</i>

07:00.554 --> 07:03.858
<i>if you like a burger,
and I know you do...</i>

07:03.891 --> 07:05.993
It's her daughter.

07:06.027 --> 07:08.596
Get me down,
get me down right now!

07:08.629 --> 07:09.997
<i>The Mad Dogs have come out</i>

07:10.031 --> 07:14.735
<i>swinging in the first,
and now lead 1-0.</i>

07:14.769 --> 07:16.137
Get me down now.

07:16.170 --> 07:17.538
Okay, how do I look?

07:17.571 --> 07:18.673
Uh, bad?

07:22.576 --> 07:24.444
Blue, darling,
how you doing, baby girl?

07:25.680 --> 07:27.848
- She's probably here for the car.
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.083
<i>Here's the pitch...</i>

07:29.116 --> 07:31.018
Ain't no reason to panic,
I'm gonna get you your money.

07:32.086 --> 07:35.022
<i>Out of nowhere, what a shot!</i>

07:40.561 --> 07:42.663
Goddammit.

07:44.999 --> 07:46.534
Sons of bitches!

07:58.813 --> 08:00.214
- I got something.
- Good.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.083
- All right, so we get a camera.
- Right.

08:02.116 --> 08:04.051
And we, uh, wait for tourists
to come to town

08:04.085 --> 08:06.754
and we take their photo in front
of like a tourist attraction.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.789
- We sell it back to them for ten dollars.
- Come on, man.

08:08.823 --> 08:10.291
Why the hell's a tourist
going to come here?

08:10.324 --> 08:11.993
All right, man,
so we drum up tourism first.

08:12.026 --> 08:13.194
You know, we do like a...

08:13.227 --> 08:15.229
Aw, hell,
there's another bridge.

08:15.262 --> 08:18.099
Holiday-themed movie theater, right?

08:18.132 --> 08:20.134
During the winter we do
just Christmas movies.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.169
We decorate it,
like, icicles in the lobby.

08:22.203 --> 08:25.139
Yeah, yeah, we can even
sell peppermint popcorn.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.173
Yeah, now you're getting it.

08:26.207 --> 08:29.243
Maybe a chunky reindeer meat.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.979
- What?
- Smoked Santa's sausage.

08:32.013 --> 08:33.647
I hate Christmas movies.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.150
That's... that's something
you should know about me, Jack.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.719
Wait... what? Nah,
Christmas movies are great, man.

08:38.753 --> 08:41.121
Full of hope,
good tidings and shit.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.027
What you got?

08:51.699 --> 08:52.800
<i>Dear Jack,</i>

08:52.833 --> 08:55.236
<i>if you're reading this,
I'm dead.</i>

08:55.269 --> 08:56.837
<i>Kiss, kiss, Mama.</i>

08:56.871 --> 08:59.140
<i>PS, left you something
under that pier.</i>

09:07.014 --> 09:08.849
What
did she leave you?

09:08.883 --> 09:12.653
- Uh, maybe, uh...
- buried treasure?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.827
What makes you think
she left you buried treasure?

09:21.662 --> 09:22.329
Because I've been here.

09:23.364 --> 09:25.900
San Clemente, California, man.

09:30.004 --> 09:33.040
<i>My mom, she took me when I was
a kid before she ran off.</i>

09:33.941 --> 09:35.109
<i>She told me about how the ships</i>

09:35.142 --> 09:36.911
<i>used to sail in and out of there</i>

09:36.944 --> 09:39.680
<i>from all over the world
carrying, you know, treasures.</i>

09:39.713 --> 09:42.817
<i>And that you might could still
find one of those treasures</i>

09:42.850 --> 09:44.819
<i>to this day if you
know where to look.</i>

09:46.187 --> 09:47.188
Uh-huh?

09:48.222 --> 09:50.357
Uh...

09:50.391 --> 09:53.027
<i>You think
your mom left us gold coins?</i>

09:53.060 --> 09:54.795
<i>I'm just saying.</i>

09:54.829 --> 09:56.831
<i>What have we got
to lose in finding out?</i>

09:58.099 --> 10:00.000
- All right, but just hear me out real quick.
- I'm listening.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.869
'Cause I'm following you but,
I just got to say,

10:01.902 --> 10:04.105
are you really
serious right now, man?

10:04.138 --> 10:06.674
Or are you just
playing a "Jack" on me?

10:06.707 --> 10:08.142
What you mean?
Of course I'm being serious!

10:08.175 --> 10:09.310
What you talking about?

10:09.343 --> 10:10.377
California?

10:10.411 --> 10:11.879
Yeah, Scottie, I'm going.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.347
You gonna come with me?

10:13.380 --> 10:14.248
I mean...

10:15.816 --> 10:17.318
shit, it's just
too far away, Jack.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.589
Too far, you say?

10:22.223 --> 10:24.758
All right,
all we got to do is hop on 59,

10:24.792 --> 10:26.827
but then we cut down
to ten at Houston, right?

10:26.861 --> 10:28.262
And go on these guys.
Those might be railroad tracks,

10:28.295 --> 10:30.231
but we'll just see when we get
there. Then we get on the 45,

10:30.264 --> 10:31.932
then we get
on the 35 to the 25...

10:36.470 --> 10:39.740
We'll be on the beach in 27 hours, baby!

10:44.912 --> 10:46.947
- That's good, Jack.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:46.981 --> 10:49.216
You stick to my plan, Scottie.
You'll see, man.

10:49.250 --> 10:52.920
This is gonna be our ticket out
of this shit hole, man.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.823
No more washing
other people's dishes.

10:55.856 --> 10:59.026
No more futile con jobs.

10:59.994 --> 11:03.964
No more getting fleeced by
the King, that's for damn sure.

11:03.998 --> 11:05.366
And when we get there, man.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.838
Five star restaurants and shit,
real deal gourmet.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.742
They got pasta with shrimp, man!

11:14.775 --> 11:16.076
I love shrimps.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.047
Granted...

11:21.182 --> 11:22.416
could be nothing.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.152
Plain old nasty pasta.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.356
But if it is, man.

11:31.091 --> 11:31.992
It's all I'm saying.

11:32.960 --> 11:33.861
What if it is?

11:59.220 --> 12:01.155
Oh, shit, we're late!

12:02.990 --> 12:04.391
- Hey, Scottie, we're late, man.
- Ow.

12:04.425 --> 12:05.359
- No, Jack.
- Late for work, man.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.760
Jack, Jack, Jack.

12:06.794 --> 12:07.928
Already called in for us.

12:07.962 --> 12:09.430
Said we ain't coming in

12:09.463 --> 12:11.298
on account of us
being millionaires and all.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.302
Billionaires, maybe.

12:16.804 --> 12:20.374
<i>Oh,
Lord, here comes Jooly Booly Rogers,</i>

12:20.407 --> 12:22.443
<i>that brutal force of nature.</i>

12:23.377 --> 12:24.411
Who'd you tell what now?

12:26.280 --> 12:28.415
- Work, man.
- <i>This is game four</i>

12:28.449 --> 12:31.252
<i>against the Montgomery Mad Dogs.</i>

12:31.285 --> 12:33.854
<i>And as you know, to stay alive,</i>

12:33.887 --> 12:37.157
<i>these Outlaws got to pull
out a win here in game four.</i>

12:37.191 --> 12:42.029
Ah, I said, "Jack's Mama
left us some inheritance money,

12:42.062 --> 12:45.065
so you can take them dishes
and shove them up your ass."

12:45.099 --> 12:47.067
It's great, man, great.
You know who owns that diner

12:47.101 --> 12:49.370
and the whole
goddamn town, huh, yeah?

12:49.403 --> 12:50.804
The King, man!

12:53.040 --> 12:54.975
Oh, shit.

12:55.009 --> 12:57.478
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on!
All right, go ahead.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.050
Good morning, Blue.
What's going on with you, girl?

13:04.418 --> 13:05.486
The King want a word with you.

13:06.655 --> 13:09.056
Yeah, definitely. Well,
you know, as matter of fact,

13:09.089 --> 13:11.158
I was going to come see King
George first thing tomorrow.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.395
Save you the trouble. Hey, you know
what, let me, uh, put on a shirt

13:14.428 --> 13:16.531
and I'll be right with you.

13:16.564 --> 13:19.501
Let me get my toothbrush!
Jack, where's my toothbrush?

13:20.868 --> 13:21.869
Dammit!

13:27.408 --> 13:29.209
Hey, hey, hey,
watch my car, man!

13:34.582 --> 13:37.284
Where are
we going, fellas?

13:47.394 --> 13:50.331
This is all a misunderstanding.

13:50.364 --> 13:52.266
And where's your bags?

13:53.334 --> 13:55.269
I was told
we were taking a trip.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.371
- We love trips.
- No, we're...

13:57.404 --> 13:59.273
- A trip? You heard what now?
- Who told you that?

13:59.306 --> 14:00.542
Fire her up.

14:01.576 --> 14:02.544
Shit.

14:06.480 --> 14:11.285
So y'all don't
know nothing about no gold coin,

14:11.318 --> 14:13.487
- wild goose chase?
- No, no.

14:13.521 --> 14:15.089
- I don't know about that.
- Geese? No.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.423
Turn right up there.

14:17.358 --> 14:19.960
And y'all weren't
thinking about skipping out

14:19.993 --> 14:22.963
on your obligations
to old King Georgie?

14:22.996 --> 14:24.465
Come on, we been pay... ow!

14:26.400 --> 14:30.070
You're just trying to fleece us like
you do the whole town. Damn, Blue!

14:30.104 --> 14:31.905
Put your seatbelt on.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.375
- She's right.
- Scottie and I, we got an opportunity.

14:34.408 --> 14:37.077
- Turn left up there.
- Uh, yes, ma'am.

14:37.111 --> 14:39.913
Hey now, look. We're not trying to skip
out on any sort of anything, all right?

14:39.947 --> 14:42.182
It's just that we, we got an
opportunity to pay you back, you know?

14:42.216 --> 14:44.586
And that's why we got to go
and get it, me and Scottie.

14:44.619 --> 14:46.954
You know? So...

14:46.987 --> 14:50.391
Use your goddamn turn signal!

14:50.424 --> 14:52.025
Yes, ma'am!

14:52.059 --> 14:53.661
Uh, but me and Scottie
both got to go, so...

14:53.695 --> 14:55.262
Pull over here a second.

14:59.433 --> 15:00.568
Let me out, come on.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.073
- I see you!
- Get, lady!

15:06.106 --> 15:07.941
- Why you running? Get over here!
- Please don't.

15:07.975 --> 15:10.512
You see...

15:10.545 --> 15:16.083
promises don't butter
any bread, fellas.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.722
And what you want might not be
just yours for the taking.

15:20.755 --> 15:26.628
Sometimes you need sacrifice,
hard work, discipline, goddammit!

15:28.429 --> 15:30.532
He didn't have your
five dollars, Ma.

15:33.167 --> 15:34.234
Let me see your teeth.

15:36.671 --> 15:40.007
- All right.
- Look, fact of the matter is: we're gonna go,

15:40.040 --> 15:42.644
we're gonna get that money,
we'll bring it back to you, all right?

15:42.677 --> 15:44.679
Hey, what I owe you, huh?

15:44.712 --> 15:46.180
- Double it. That's it.
- Double it.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.381
That's a "Jack guarantee."

15:48.415 --> 15:49.751
All right.

15:49.784 --> 15:51.485
Pull in there.

15:51.519 --> 15:53.120
Shit,
"Jack Guarantee."

15:53.153 --> 15:54.087
That's good, huh?

15:56.457 --> 15:58.459
I am gonna do you one better.

16:01.061 --> 16:01.995
Save you the trouble.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.231
Blue here.

16:05.232 --> 16:08.402
Blue is gonna go get it for ya.

16:08.435 --> 16:11.539
- I'll hang onto your car in the meantime.
- No, no...

16:11.573 --> 16:13.474
And that's
a "King George Guarantee."

16:17.244 --> 16:18.580
Meanwhile...

16:19.581 --> 16:21.448
you can just cool your heels

16:21.482 --> 16:23.283
with my friends here.

16:26.521 --> 16:27.387
But wait.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.661
Come on out, fellas.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.433
What's that you been
saying about beaches, Jack?

16:39.466 --> 16:43.237
Oh, you mean, uh, "75 degrees year
round, color TV in every room"?

16:44.806 --> 16:46.206
I hear the waves already.

16:52.246 --> 16:53.715
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit indeed, Jack!

16:53.748 --> 16:55.349
It's a civil matter, man!

16:55.382 --> 16:56.818
It's not like she'll
call the cops on us.

16:56.851 --> 16:58.720
Yeah, that ain't what
I'm worried about right now!

16:58.753 --> 17:00.220
It's not even her car, okay?

17:00.254 --> 17:02.389
For the record,
she, she's the crook!

17:02.422 --> 17:05.157
- Yeah, crooked as a crocodile!
- Less teeth too.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.160
Shit, woo-hoo!

17:07.194 --> 17:08.663
Woo-hoo!

17:08.695 --> 17:10.464
Hey, man, you and me, right?

17:10.497 --> 17:11.833
- Yeah. Yeah!
- All the way?

17:11.866 --> 17:13.667
Look, we drive
straight though, man,

17:13.701 --> 17:16.503
we can hit the beach by Monday.
You know what that is, right?

17:16.538 --> 17:18.806
- That's the day of Independence, baby.
- That's right!

17:20.107 --> 17:22.376
We'll be watching the rockets
over California skies.

17:33.287 --> 17:36.223
- So, they got like a white wine sauce on there.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.794
- With butter or cream, or something.
- So, so, white wine and dairy?

17:39.827 --> 17:42.864
- Yeah, yeah, that's how they do it.
- All right. I love good cream.

17:42.897 --> 17:45.567
- Yeah, and lemon. They got lemon on there.
- Oh, lemons?

17:45.600 --> 17:47.502
- Yeah.
- Damn.

17:47.535 --> 17:48.836
It's very well balanced.

17:52.607 --> 17:55.409
Oh, and that shrimp, man!
Big old juicy, butterfly...

17:55.442 --> 17:57.745
Jack, I feel like I'm pushing
all the weight, man.

17:57.779 --> 18:00.615
- Oh, put your back into it.
- My back's in it.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.753
Come on, come on.

18:10.658 --> 18:12.125
Hell!

18:13.327 --> 18:15.429
- That could be good enough, huh?
- Yeah, it'll reach.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.398
Whoo!

18:22.804 --> 18:25.540
- Dine and dash?
- Don't know that we got much of a choice.

18:25.573 --> 18:27.575
Yes, yes indeed.

18:35.650 --> 18:38.218
It don't pump.
It ain't coming through.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.622
- Oh, I got to do this now.
- Yeah, you just kind of...

18:40.655 --> 18:43.290
And then, um, I heard
before you kind of have to

18:43.323 --> 18:45.593
- put your weight on it.
- Oh, you're like squeezing it out, huh?

18:45.627 --> 18:46.828
Yeah, kinda like that.

18:50.865 --> 18:53.400
- Hey, guys!
- What?

18:53.433 --> 18:55.770
- It's pre-pay!
- What's that now?

18:55.803 --> 18:58.205
You pay first
and then you get the gas.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.273
- Yeah, we already know that.
- Yeah, no,

19:00.307 --> 19:02.677
- thanks for the tip, <i>amigo</i>.
- No problem!

19:02.710 --> 19:04.444
We ain't stupid!

19:04.478 --> 19:05.345
Shit!

19:18.492 --> 19:21.461
- Real pickle.
- You know, I bet his car's full of gas.

19:21.495 --> 19:24.464
Yeah, stupid pre-pay!
Who thought of that?

19:24.498 --> 19:27.401
You know, it's 'cause there ain't
no trust in this world anymore.

19:33.808 --> 19:35.943
Oh, that's good.
Yep, that's good.

19:36.844 --> 19:38.880
When I'm good, I'm good, man.
I don't know what to tell you.

19:38.913 --> 19:41.516
- What you got?
- Oh, right, here's the plan.

19:41.549 --> 19:42.817
All right.

19:42.850 --> 19:45.653
- When I give you the signal...
- Mm-hmm.

19:45.687 --> 19:46.788
...you get the car running.

19:47.755 --> 19:48.623
All right.

19:51.258 --> 19:51.926
That was it?

19:52.894 --> 19:55.730
Oh, all right.
Thanks for explaining it to me!

20:11.946 --> 20:13.313
Morning, beautiful.

20:14.649 --> 20:16.784
Uh, gimme some
unleaded, darling.

20:17.785 --> 20:20.487
- How much do you want?
- Oh, just fill her up.

20:37.805 --> 20:39.707
I love that jumper
you've got on.

20:39.741 --> 20:41.976
What's that, Egyptian cotton?

20:43.811 --> 20:44.746
Egypt?

20:44.779 --> 20:46.748
- Well, you...
- Uh-oh,

20:46.781 --> 20:48.950
someone's out
of mayonnaise packets.

20:48.983 --> 20:51.853
I'm just joshing,
I'm fine, thanks.

21:12.807 --> 21:15.342
Say, ma'am, now, I know this is a little
out of the ordinary but I wanted to...

21:15.375 --> 21:17.477
That'll be $12.67.

21:18.813 --> 21:22.784
Righty-oh, let's see here. I just
got to... You go on ahead of me, kimosabe.

21:22.817 --> 21:24.351
No, take your time.
I'm in no hurry.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.653
Okay, uh, what was that?

21:25.686 --> 21:27.755
- 12.67.
- 67.

21:27.789 --> 21:28.823
12.67.

21:32.527 --> 21:33.995
<i>Here we are in game five</i>

21:34.028 --> 21:37.698
<i>and aw, jumping Jupiter, here
comes Rogers from the bullpen,</i>

21:37.732 --> 21:40.101
<i>with the devil in his eyes.</i>

21:40.134 --> 21:42.804
<i>It's not looking
good for our boys.</i>

21:42.837 --> 21:44.639
God, this is embarrassing.

21:44.672 --> 21:45.873
I left my wallet in the car.

21:45.907 --> 21:48.576
Would you believe that? So,
I'm going to go find my friend,

21:48.609 --> 21:51.045
get my wallet, and then
return to... Oh, Scottie.

21:51.078 --> 21:52.914
- Hey, Jack.
- It's my friend. Thank God you're...

21:52.947 --> 21:54.849
- We got to go.
- Why, what's up?

21:57.484 --> 21:58.953
I'm calling
the police.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.493
Terribly sorry, ma'am,
we're going to need this one on credit.

22:06.527 --> 22:08.428
- Thank you, have a nice day!
- Drop it.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.667
Oh!

22:12.700 --> 22:14.135
Don't shoot.

22:14.168 --> 22:15.603
- Please, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

22:15.636 --> 22:16.971
- Don't shoot!
- Hold still, sonny!

22:17.004 --> 22:18.706
Hold still, I can get them!

22:18.739 --> 22:20.808
Don't shoot, no!
No, don't shoot!

22:20.842 --> 22:22.076
Hold still!

22:22.109 --> 22:23.644
Don't shoot! No!

22:24.812 --> 22:27.014
No, no, no, ow!

22:33.588 --> 22:36.423
<i>Rogers,
as cool as a be-bopping beatnik,</i>

22:36.456 --> 22:38.993
<i>shaking off calls,
closing in for the kill.</i>

22:39.026 --> 22:41.729
<i>And whoa, whoa, there's Chili

22:41.762 --> 22:44.131
<i>And here's the wind up

22:44.165 --> 22:45.900
<i>Davis is going for it!</i>

22:45.933 --> 22:47.768
<i>He's stealing home!</i>

22:47.802 --> 22:50.104
<i>And Rogers rockets
the ball to home plate...</i>

22:51.739 --> 22:53.574
<i>Holy Hades, they did it!</i>

22:53.608 --> 22:55.076
<i>After a nasty crash...</i>

22:55.109 --> 22:56.811
Oh my god, oh my god, please!
What's going on?

22:56.844 --> 22:59.412
Please call the cops,
call the cops. Lady!

23:12.994 --> 23:14.128
It ain't easy.

23:17.031 --> 23:19.867
Come here, you're okay.

23:19.901 --> 23:22.103
- Hell, no.
- You got to grab it, you know?

23:22.136 --> 23:25.072
You just got to get up in
there and grab it by the horns

23:25.106 --> 23:27.842
and if you don't, it's going
to pass you by, I think.

23:28.033 --> 23:28.742
Are you set?

23:28.776 --> 23:29.710
Are we doing
the interview first?

23:30.035 --> 23:32.613
- Interview first.
- Oh, I didn't know that.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.629
Can you tells us your name,
and where you’re from?

23:40.988 --> 23:43.157
Blue Eyes Montgomery,
I'm from Aberdeen.

23:44.258 --> 23:45.843
Blue Eyes, what’s
your occupation?

23:48.229 --> 23:49.997
Do you really want to know?

23:50.031 --> 23:51.866
They ain't people,
they ain't real people.

23:52.833 --> 23:54.902
Nobody's real people, really.

23:54.936 --> 23:57.104
They're just running
around using each other.

23:57.138 --> 23:59.774
And I'm there to clean them up,
that's what I'm there to do.

23:59.807 --> 24:02.475
<i>Ocean City may have
squeaked out a victory today but they...</i>

24:02.510 --> 24:04.812
I listen to it more now.
I like to...

24:05.880 --> 24:09.183
I like to hear it so I can
see it in my mind more.

24:09.216 --> 24:11.652
You know, more fun that way.

24:11.686 --> 24:12.920
Make it any way you want.

24:18.192 --> 24:19.827
<i>This is unit 16.</i>

24:19.860 --> 24:21.696
<i>Looks like the suspects
are headed west</i>

24:21.729 --> 24:23.463
<i>across those railroad tracks.</i>

24:28.202 --> 24:29.537
That gon' be fun.

24:31.005 --> 24:32.740
Come on, guys,
let me out of here!

24:33.641 --> 24:36.010
- Jesus of Nazareth, Scottie!
- Well, what was I supposed to do?

24:36.043 --> 24:37.945
- Not that, man!
- Hey, man, it worked, didn't it?

24:37.979 --> 24:39.981
So, uh, uh, thank you, Scottie.

24:40.014 --> 24:41.282
Oh, you're welcome, Jack!

24:43.551 --> 24:45.720
He was pissing his pants,
man! That was great!

24:45.753 --> 24:48.622
Yeah, it was great. All right.

24:48.656 --> 24:50.558
- Yeah?
- Let's, let's just dump him out.

24:50.591 --> 24:52.893
No, man, he'll rat us
straight to the cops!

24:54.895 --> 24:57.631
- Okay, all right, man, it's fine.
- All right.

24:57.665 --> 25:00.101
We'll drive to the middle of nowhere.
We'll dump him out there

25:00.134 --> 25:03.270
and by the time he can be any trouble for
us, we'll be, you know, across state lines.

25:03.304 --> 25:05.740
All right, man, but let's
not be too hasty, you know?

25:05.773 --> 25:07.742
I mean, dude's probably
rolling in cash.

25:07.775 --> 25:11.045
- Whoa, whoa!
- Hey, you started this train, Jack.

25:11.078 --> 25:14.782
I'm just trying to keep it rolling for us.
I mean, look, it's either this,

25:14.815 --> 25:17.885
or if you'd like, we could
rob some more gas stations.

25:17.918 --> 25:21.756
- No, we're not robbing anything.
- Hey, shit, you're the boss, man.

25:27.161 --> 25:29.563
- He has got a tie.
- It's a hell of a tie, Jack.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.167
- Okay.
- Yeah?

25:33.200 --> 25:35.302
Uh, if we borrow the money

25:35.336 --> 25:37.304
and then we pay him
back when we get there,

25:37.338 --> 25:40.007
- it's not a big deal.
- Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

25:40.041 --> 25:41.642
But look,
we got to play the part,

25:41.675 --> 25:43.110
we got to act tough,
we can't Mickey Mouse this.

25:43.144 --> 25:45.880
What you mean Mickey Mouse, son?
I got this, look!

25:45.913 --> 25:47.782
Ah! Yeah, yeah, no,

25:47.815 --> 25:49.316
maybe, like, just take
it down a little bit.

25:49.350 --> 25:51.185
- I wanted to scare him.
- Yeah, yeah, but there's

25:51.218 --> 25:53.587
a certain subtle civility to
what we're doing here, you know?

25:53.621 --> 25:56.190
- All right, all right.
- Yeah, yeah, maybe split the difference.

25:56.223 --> 25:57.892
- What you want me to do?
- Just like...

25:59.360 --> 26:02.163
- Mmm.
- That's not what... Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

26:02.196 --> 26:04.899
What did
I tell you, huh?

26:04.932 --> 26:07.334
- What did I tell you, huh?
- Do what we say!

26:07.368 --> 26:09.804
- Come on, come on, let's see!
- Okay!

26:20.014 --> 26:22.083
Collin Hornsby.

26:22.116 --> 26:24.018
You know something, Collin?

26:24.051 --> 26:25.853
The first
time I laid eyes on you,

26:25.886 --> 26:28.055
the first time I saw you,
I said, there goes a cool guy.

26:28.089 --> 26:30.057
A cool guy who ain't going
to do nothing stupid, remember?

26:30.091 --> 26:32.760
- He said that to me, Collin.
- That's right, right, Collin?

26:32.793 --> 26:35.229
You're a cool guy who ain't going
to do nothing stupid, right?

26:35.262 --> 26:36.897
- Huh, huh?
- Yeah.

26:36.931 --> 26:38.999
- Yeah? Say yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

26:39.033 --> 26:42.203
Wakeman, Arizona.
Now, what's in Wakeman, Collin?

26:42.236 --> 26:44.905
I mean, what's in
Wakeman, Collin?

26:44.939 --> 26:48.075
My fiancee, who'd be worried,
so you should let me go.

26:48.109 --> 26:49.743
- Oh!
- What was that again?

26:49.777 --> 26:51.212
- What did he just say to us?
- Again?

26:51.245 --> 26:52.713
Go ahead,
say that again, Collin.

26:52.746 --> 26:53.614
Back up.

26:54.748 --> 26:58.219
- I said, you should let me go.
- Uh-uh. He said fiancee.

26:58.252 --> 27:01.021
Collin,
you see, I'd hate to

27:01.055 --> 27:03.057
have to show up
in Wakeman, Arizona,

27:03.090 --> 27:05.693
- and make some trouble for your little fiancee.
- What, no, you...

27:05.726 --> 27:07.928
- Don't talk right now.
- As we've established, Collin, you're a cool,

27:07.962 --> 27:09.296
smart guy, and as such,
I'm sure you can appreciate

27:09.330 --> 27:11.699
the opportunity viable of
a well-timed loan, yeah?

27:11.732 --> 27:13.200
- Yeah. Wait what?
- Say yeah.

27:13.234 --> 27:15.769
We want your money,
Collin, where's it at?

27:15.803 --> 27:18.806
- He's broke!
- New plan!

27:18.839 --> 27:20.674
Well, look, man,
we really appreciate your time!

27:20.708 --> 27:23.410
I wish you the best
of luck, <i>bon voyage</i>!

27:23.444 --> 27:24.979
Good riddance!

27:41.795 --> 27:43.430
All right,
so what's the deal, Jackie?

27:43.464 --> 27:46.433
I mean, the way I see it,
we just keep on robbing places.

27:46.467 --> 27:49.403
- We're not thieves. He's kidding, inside joke.
- How you doing?

27:49.436 --> 27:50.704
So, here's the plan.

27:51.405 --> 27:53.974
I go in, I do my thing.

27:54.008 --> 27:56.410
I make the pitch.
We're going to pay them back

27:56.443 --> 27:59.046
when we find the treasure,
right? It's an IOU.

27:59.079 --> 28:01.782
And, look, we're good people,
they'll help us out.

28:01.815 --> 28:05.252
Of course,
from time to time, uh,

28:05.286 --> 28:07.354
they may not
buy what we're selling

28:07.388 --> 28:12.259
and it might be necessary to,
you know, play the part.

28:12.293 --> 28:13.727
Play the part.

28:15.029 --> 28:16.830
Give us the money!

28:16.864 --> 28:17.965
Yeah!

28:20.167 --> 28:22.736
Your idea is just my idea.

28:23.538 --> 28:26.040
- No, no.
- Kind of.

28:26.073 --> 28:28.776
I don't feel like you're listening, man.
You see, what I'm going to do

28:28.809 --> 28:32.947
is I'm going to write down the,
you know, address of wherever we go.

28:32.980 --> 28:34.516
- Uh-huh.
- Write down what we took

28:34.549 --> 28:37.851
and let them know that I'm going
to be sending it back to them.

28:37.885 --> 28:40.421
It's not stealing
if we pay them back

28:40.454 --> 28:42.022
when we get where we're
going. That's just a...

28:42.056 --> 28:43.791
- Sure.
- Forced loan, right?

28:43.824 --> 28:46.093
It's kind of,
it was like my idea,

28:46.126 --> 28:50.097
but then just, you know,
more lying and dishonesty.

28:50.130 --> 28:51.498
That makes sense, yeah.

28:55.903 --> 28:57.238
What if they're packing?

29:02.443 --> 29:04.011
Yeah, about that...

29:06.013 --> 29:08.148
Sure was easier
having Collin around.

29:32.973 --> 29:34.041
That's something.

30:03.037 --> 30:04.938
All right,
here we go. Okay.

30:11.579 --> 30:14.448
- Oh, come on.
- Collin!

30:14.481 --> 30:15.816
Buddy, hey!

30:18.452 --> 30:21.021
- Buddy, it's us!
- We just want to hang out, man!

30:23.490 --> 30:25.426
You're making it harder
for yourself, Collin.

30:25.459 --> 30:27.294
Come on!

30:28.195 --> 30:30.565
You can't run
from a car, Collin!

30:30.598 --> 30:32.567
- I can try!
- Where you going?

30:32.600 --> 30:36.337
Look, we've got a mutually
beneficial proposition for you!

30:36.370 --> 30:38.972
You're making things more
difficult than they got to be, man!

30:39.006 --> 30:41.008
- Stop it, no!
- Collin!

30:41.041 --> 30:43.444
- Leave me alone!
- This doesn't have to be hard, Collin!

30:43.477 --> 30:45.212
- No, leave me alone!
- You want a water?

30:45.245 --> 30:47.114
I got a cup of water in the car.

30:49.383 --> 30:51.452
Come on, man, Collin.

30:51.485 --> 30:53.153
You look tired, man,
get in the car.

30:56.156 --> 30:57.191
Not again!

30:58.560 --> 31:00.260
All right, Collin.

31:00.294 --> 31:01.929
Say, what line of
work you in, man?

31:01.962 --> 31:04.164
No, no, no, we don't need
to be talking to him,

31:04.198 --> 31:06.867
getting all buddy buddy, and
you're making friends with him?

31:07.635 --> 31:09.637
Bosco and Bosco.

31:09.671 --> 31:11.372
- Oh, okay!
- I work at a catalog.

31:11.405 --> 31:13.675
I take the calls
and then manage the sales.

31:13.708 --> 31:16.276
Catalog man,
that's, that's good business!

31:16.310 --> 31:19.012
- Shut up, it's not good business!
- I'm just trying to grease

31:19.046 --> 31:21.181
the wheels, all right? You catch
more flies with honey than vinegar.

31:21.215 --> 31:23.450
- Oh, no, no.
- I'll tell him about the thing.

31:23.484 --> 31:24.985
Yeah, come on, let's tell
him about the treasure.

31:25.018 --> 31:26.353
- No.
- Yeah, look.

31:34.094 --> 31:36.196
Collin, you ever been
to California, man?

31:36.230 --> 31:39.366
- No.
- Well, you see, Collin,

31:39.400 --> 31:43.170
they got this place way out
west called San Clemente.

31:43.203 --> 31:47.040
Great beaches, beautiful
sand, crystalline waters.

31:47.074 --> 31:48.676
They got something else
that makes it special, Collin.

31:48.710 --> 31:51.445
- Do you know what that is?
- No.

31:51.478 --> 31:54.649
Buried treasure,
hidden loot just for us, man.

31:54.682 --> 31:56.684
- Golden coins, Collin!
- Hundreds of them, Collin.

31:56.718 --> 31:59.119
- Probably thousands.
- Possible millions, Collin.

31:59.153 --> 32:01.422
Possibly! That's why
I'm glad we're friends

32:01.455 --> 32:04.024
'cause we want
to share it with you.

32:04.057 --> 32:07.394
- Our best friend.
- Now, of course, getting there,

32:07.428 --> 32:08.996
we're going to need
a little bit of help.

32:09.029 --> 32:10.230
So, what
we're asking you, Collin,

32:10.264 --> 32:12.366
is are you ready

32:12.399 --> 32:14.736
to be part of the big time, huh?

32:14.769 --> 32:18.338
Jack and Scottie
and their hostage gang.

32:19.239 --> 32:21.375
- We'll work on the name.
- Little Buddy Gang.

32:21.408 --> 32:23.678
Yeah, that's good.

32:23.711 --> 32:25.513
Jesus, man, are you crying?

32:25.547 --> 32:28.215
- No, you can't cry in here.
- No, Collin, man.

32:28.248 --> 32:30.117
There's no need for
you to be crying.

32:30.150 --> 32:32.319
No, we're not like...
we're just doing a thing, we're playing.

32:32.352 --> 32:34.455
We're doing a thing right now.
We're just like you, man.

32:34.488 --> 32:36.390
We're regular guys.
We're just like you.

32:36.423 --> 32:37.759
I can't believe
this is happening!

32:37.792 --> 32:41.061
All 'cause I had to pee
and so, I couldn't just stop.

32:41.094 --> 32:44.264
I had to keep... All because
I went to the stupid Pump N Stump.

32:44.298 --> 32:47.201
I had to pee!
You two stupid heads grab me

32:47.234 --> 32:49.269
and you held a knife
to my fricking throat!

32:49.303 --> 32:51.573
That's dangerous,
I eat through that throat!

32:51.606 --> 32:54.642
All right, I'm not mean, I'm not a
criminal! I'm tired and I'm hungry!

32:54.676 --> 32:58.445
Trash, you're just human trash, and you're not
letting me eat and you're not letting me leave!

32:58.479 --> 33:00.414
I could've brought
the cheese poofs with us!

33:00.447 --> 33:02.349
You guys are like,
"No, you don't get to eat!"

33:02.382 --> 33:04.686
And now, I'm starving.
What do you think is going to happen?

33:04.719 --> 33:07.120
I'm going to give you a million dollars?
I don't have a million dollars.

33:07.154 --> 33:10.257
I belong at the Sizzler
having a baked potato and...

33:10.290 --> 33:12.627
We all like baked potatoes, man.
We're the same.

33:12.660 --> 33:14.696
My whole family fucking
loves baked potatoes.

33:14.729 --> 33:18.031
I don't care about you and your family!
I just want two things!

33:18.065 --> 33:19.801
To leave and to eat!

33:19.834 --> 33:21.703
I'll do them in either order!

33:21.736 --> 33:23.370
All right.

33:23.403 --> 33:24.539
You done, man?

33:25.472 --> 33:26.574
Yeah.

33:36.784 --> 33:38.352
<i>Welcome to Frostop.
Can I take your order?</i>

33:38.385 --> 33:41.054
All right, fellas. Let's do a...

33:41.088 --> 33:46.460
I'm going to go with a chicken on a
stick, uh, fried pickles. Uh...

33:46.493 --> 33:48.763
- Okay.
- ...two orders of fries, one with the cheese,

33:48.796 --> 33:51.064
- one with the gravy.
- All right, all right.

33:51.098 --> 33:53.233
Look, man, I asked for a
milkshake, he got fried pickles.

33:53.267 --> 33:55.369
If he's getting fried pickles,
I want a milkshake and fried pickles!

33:55.402 --> 33:56.671
Collin, I think we're
going to have to downsize

33:56.704 --> 33:58.806
that order a bit so we
can make it to the next town.

33:58.840 --> 34:00.742
- But I'm hungry.
- But you're not going to finish all that,

34:00.775 --> 34:04.144
- so just pick one.
- All right, then, uh, double hamburger...

34:04.177 --> 34:07.782
No, man. Just get a single
hamburger like the rest of us.

34:08.683 --> 34:10.449
Fine, single hamburger
with cheese...

34:10.484 --> 34:12.152
I'm not made of money,
Collin. I tell you what.

34:12.185 --> 34:14.856
Uh, we're going to go
and do three of the, uh...

34:14.889 --> 34:16.791
oh, look at that,
cheese sandwiches.

34:16.824 --> 34:19.159
Everyone like cheese?
Three cheese sandwiches.

34:19.192 --> 34:20.293
- Yum.
- And, uh...

34:22.396 --> 34:24.264
- one cheese sandwich all day.
- One cheese sandwich!

34:24.297 --> 34:27.400
Water. Uh, large water.

34:27.434 --> 34:29.469
- <i>Anything else?</i>
- Yeah, call the cops!

34:29.504 --> 34:31.739
- I'm a hostage...
- Nope, no, no.

34:31.773 --> 34:32.840
That's got it!

34:35.342 --> 34:36.844
<i>All right, pull up.</i>

34:39.446 --> 34:40.414
Oh, like they'd do it.

34:56.330 --> 34:57.799
- You look really cool.
- You think so?

34:57.832 --> 34:59.534
Yeah, like...
no, really, really cool.

34:59.567 --> 35:01.301
- You think it's going to scare them?
- Well, yeah.

35:01.335 --> 35:02.870
- Whoever is in there?
- It's definitely distinctive.

35:02.904 --> 35:04.906
- They'll remember you.
- Guys, we can't do this!

35:04.939 --> 35:07.474
- Stealing is wrong.
- Yeah, yeah, wrong. That's cool, man.

35:07.508 --> 35:09.711
Come on, Collin,
don't let your tribe down.

35:09.744 --> 35:13.581
- It's not all about you.
- Look, Collin, it's very simple, man.

35:13.615 --> 35:16.183
You just go in there
like regular.

35:16.216 --> 35:18.218
You just
shop around, like regular,

35:18.251 --> 35:20.253
and then we're going to come in
and do the hostage thing.

35:20.287 --> 35:22.189
- Like regular, Collin.
- Yeah!

35:22.222 --> 35:24.391
- No, guys, they'll kill me!
- Look, they might kill you,

35:24.424 --> 35:26.259
but if you don't go in there,
I definitely will.

35:26.293 --> 35:29.564
Oh, Collin, you know what?

35:29.597 --> 35:34.234
I believe in you, and, uh, I
know you'll do the right thing.

35:34.267 --> 35:35.469
Boop!

35:35.503 --> 35:36.470
Or I'll kill you.

36:41.903 --> 36:45.873
There's... This is about
to be a robbery, okay?

36:45.907 --> 36:47.775
What?

36:47.809 --> 36:50.578
I said this is going to be a
robbery, so please listen to me.

36:50.611 --> 36:52.780
- Oh, shit.
- You have to call the police.

36:52.814 --> 36:55.516
Oh, shit. Just don't hurt me!
Don't hurt me, okay?

36:55.550 --> 36:57.685
I'm not trying to hurt you!

36:57.719 --> 36:59.252
I'm trying to help you!

37:02.489 --> 37:03.925
Ready for my close-up,
Jackie boy.

37:03.958 --> 37:05.727
White,
sandy beaches, baby.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.394
Police, call them!

37:07.427 --> 37:08.930
- You have the phone!
- Oh, well, okay.

37:08.963 --> 37:10.698
- There's got to be a phone!
- I guess that's how

37:10.732 --> 37:12.633
- we're doing it.
- Why aren't you paying attention to what

37:12.667 --> 37:14.869
- I'm saying?
- Good afternoon, I have a proposal for you.

37:27.380 --> 37:28.716
In good time, these investments

37:28.750 --> 37:31.552
will be repaid with dividends.

37:31.586 --> 37:35.990
And we will leave you and this innocent hostage alone.

37:38.626 --> 37:40.327
- Hey!
- Holy shit.

37:40.360 --> 37:41.929
- That went well, huh?
- Yeah.

37:41.963 --> 37:43.998
Dude, experts, man,
that's what we are!

37:46.100 --> 37:47.334
Damn!

37:47.367 --> 37:49.771
Here we go.

38:06.888 --> 38:08.790
All right, little buddy,
we'll be right back.

38:08.823 --> 38:10.958
- What do you mean right back?
- Right back.

38:11.993 --> 38:13.861
We're coming to
buy fireworks is what...

38:16.998 --> 38:18.599
Yeah, two Roman
candles for my friend here,

38:18.633 --> 38:20.034
- who forgot to pay.
- Buying things.

38:20.067 --> 38:22.503
- Is that it? Okay.
- Okay, that's it.

38:22.537 --> 38:24.806
what about 400 best fireworks, man?

38:24.839 --> 38:26.373
All right,
is that everything?

38:31.913 --> 38:33.881
Wait,
fireworks? That's...

38:33.915 --> 38:36.517
You all are risking
my life to buy fireworks?

38:36.551 --> 38:38.085
No, no, no, no, no,
we got to start spending

38:38.119 --> 38:40.021
some of that money on
feeding me, all right?

38:40.054 --> 38:42.990
And something good, all right?
No more cheese sandwiches.

38:43.024 --> 38:46.493
Here's the list of restaurants that I'm
willing to eat at in descending order.

38:46.527 --> 38:48.596
Number one, Sizzler.

38:48.629 --> 38:50.631
Number two,
I don't know the name of it

38:50.665 --> 38:52.567
but it was that place where we
got those really good burgers.

38:57.872 --> 39:01.542
- Sorry, Jack.
- You're the one who's going to blow up your own car.

39:24.832 --> 39:27.869
Oh, hell, looks like
they're headed right for us.

39:27.902 --> 39:29.737
We going to have to bust
these poor boys.

39:30.671 --> 39:35.042
Hot damn, you better bet
your sweet bippy, baby!

39:35.076 --> 39:39.714
And you, you might want to
get your hair done, darling.

39:39.747 --> 39:42.617
'Cause after I take these
two bozos down...

39:42.650 --> 39:45.119
every paper
in the tri-county area

39:45.152 --> 39:47.420
is going to be
knocking on that door.

39:47.454 --> 39:48.723
Come in!

39:50.691 --> 39:53.961
Three gas depots in two days.
Who says they'll strike again?

39:53.995 --> 39:56.163
All right, this will
be just mighty fine.

39:56.197 --> 39:57.999
They can make
my picture right here

39:58.032 --> 39:59.934
in front of these plaques.

39:59.967 --> 40:04.205
Ooh. I'll be on the cover
of "People" magazine.

40:04.238 --> 40:06.007
I'm going
to meet President Carter,

40:06.040 --> 40:07.909
go to dinner with
Farrah Fawcett.

40:07.942 --> 40:10.211
It's all
happening too fast.

40:10.244 --> 40:11.979
Wait, wait.

40:13.114 --> 40:16.817
I could sing the national anthem
at Dallas Cowboys game.

40:24.825 --> 40:28.763
They're going to make me
mayor of Hero-town!

40:30.564 --> 40:33.067
Sweet dreaming
little tater head.

40:33.100 --> 40:37.004
By now, they're probably
desperate and miserable.

40:37.038 --> 40:39.472
You weren't eating like
this before you came across us.

40:39.507 --> 40:41.175
- No, you were not!
- Hey, I know I'm doubting.

40:41.208 --> 40:43.044
No, you were not
eating like this.

40:43.077 --> 40:44.879
I've a chicken on
a stick before.

40:44.912 --> 40:46.881
- I mean...
- You've had a dashboard full of food before.

40:46.914 --> 40:49.650
I'll admit I've never eaten
a car full of food but...

40:49.684 --> 40:51.218
- There you go.
- That's what I'm trying to say!

41:07.301 --> 41:12.573
I think America is
the land of freedom for anyone.

41:12.606 --> 41:16.143
Getting out of small towns,
getting to the big city.

41:16.177 --> 41:17.678
I'm a firm believer
in hard work.

41:17.712 --> 41:21.983
If you work hard, you'll, you'll be
able to get everything that you want.

41:22.016 --> 41:24.185
As long as you
pull up your bootstraps.

41:25.219 --> 41:27.288
I guess I kind of
think that's bullshit.

41:27.321 --> 41:30.725
Dreamers and schemers.

41:30.758 --> 41:32.827
No, I'm a doer.

41:32.860 --> 41:34.161
I'm a taker.

41:34.195 --> 41:37.164
The American Dream
is our prerogative,

41:37.198 --> 41:41.268
you know, to, to, to manifest our
destiny, you know? Uh, uh, uh.

41:41.302 --> 41:43.971
Make it happen for yourself.

41:44.005 --> 41:47.775
I had a dream a couple weeks ago
that I was, like, in a claw machine

41:47.808 --> 41:49.677
and I was one of the bears

41:49.710 --> 41:52.046
and, like, my father
was not grabbing me.

41:52.079 --> 41:53.781
I don't know
what that meant but.

41:53.814 --> 41:56.183
Don't be afraid to give up
and start a new dream.

41:57.685 --> 41:59.286

46:32.459 --> 46:33.861
You think it's real?

46:33.894 --> 46:35.530
The coins and the treasure
and stuff?

46:37.464 --> 46:39.233
Well, I feel like you're
missing the point.

46:43.270 --> 46:44.305
All right.

46:46.173 --> 46:48.175
When I was a kid, I was
real afraid of the water

46:48.208 --> 46:51.211
'cause all the creeks were ever
full of cottonmouths and shit.

46:51.245 --> 46:52.846
- Snakes.
- Yeah.

46:54.882 --> 46:57.451
So, this one time we went
on a real deal, you know,

46:57.484 --> 47:00.487
picket fence type of family
vacation, beach trip.

47:00.522 --> 47:03.223
- San Clemente!
- Yeah, that's right.

47:03.257 --> 47:05.225
And, uh, you know,
we got out to the beach,

47:05.259 --> 47:08.596
and it was beautiful
but I just... I wouldn't go in.

47:08.630 --> 47:10.464
I was too scared.

47:13.568 --> 47:15.903
So...

47:15.936 --> 47:17.404
On the very last night,
she came and got me

47:17.438 --> 47:20.608
out of bed, took me beyond
the boardwalk, under a pier.

47:22.209 --> 47:25.212
And we're standing there,
we're looking at the water and, uh...

47:27.314 --> 47:29.517
you know, sure enough,
there was a little,

47:29.551 --> 47:32.353
a golden glint in
the water, in the surface.

47:32.386 --> 47:33.420
Snake!

47:34.388 --> 47:38.892
No,
a coin presumably, uh.

47:38.926 --> 47:41.061
And so, I'm looking at it,
just wide-eyed.

47:41.095 --> 47:43.464
And she's looking at me looking at it.
And so, my mama says to me,

47:43.497 --> 47:44.532
"Well...

47:46.233 --> 47:48.001
have you got the balls
or haven't you?"

48:04.118 --> 48:06.019
Well... did you?

48:07.321 --> 48:08.455
Did you have the balls?

48:10.224 --> 48:15.195
I, uh, got in halfway
and froze up, nearly drowned.

48:19.233 --> 48:23.036
- Got right in over my head.
- Yeah, he's kind of got a knack for that, Collin.

48:36.651 --> 48:40.187
But, uh, you know,
she scooped me out, obviously.

48:42.256 --> 48:43.625
Sounds like a great mom.

48:43.658 --> 48:46.393
Yeah, yeah.

48:46.427 --> 48:47.995
I mean, you know,
she left us the next summer,

48:48.028 --> 48:50.164
so maybe jury is still
out on that one but, uh...

49:24.498 --> 49:26.233

of put some pants on first.

50:23.457 --> 50:26.226

it's not...

50:27.529 --> 50:31.465
Okay, allowances.

50:31.498 --> 50:34.401
- Uh, allowances.
- Wait, I should go get the facepaint first

50:34.434 --> 50:36.203
- before we do this.
- No, man, no.

50:36.236 --> 50:38.740
Look, we're...
playing it straight, man.

50:38.773 --> 50:40.608
We've got plenty. Here.

50:41.643 --> 50:44.579
That's wasteful, man.
We can just keep the money.

50:48.148 --> 50:49.751
What? That's the deal.

50:49.784 --> 50:52.286

50:57.224 --> 51:00.695
- Yeah, why is that?
- 'Cause it's blue!

51:00.728 --> 51:03.565
Get the red, and then I got the blue
and it's like.

51:03.598 --> 51:06.366
- Oh, yeah, cool.
- Do you know why I get the blue ones, Jack?

51:06.400 --> 51:08.503
- No, why's that?
- Blue-lina!

51:08.536 --> 51:11.338
That's your girlfriend, huh?

51:11.371 --> 51:13.775
No, well, her name's Bohlina
but I say Blue-lina

51:13.808 --> 51:15.409
- 'cause it sounds like...
- Aw, it's cute, man.

51:22.349 --> 51:24.519
No.

51:24.552 --> 51:25.419
Psst!

51:26.688 --> 51:29.289

- The Star Spangled Bandit.

51:31.793 --> 51:33.561

51:42.402 --> 51:44.505
And then she's got these hips.

51:44.539 --> 51:46.608
Like, two...
like, she's got two hips.

51:46.641 --> 51:48.408
- Two sets of hips?
- Yeah, no.

51:48.442 --> 51:50.712
Damn, you really
think that's him?

51:50.745 --> 51:52.880
According to that article,
man, they say he's tall,

51:52.914 --> 51:54.281
he's good looking, he's fast.

51:54.314 --> 51:55.850
And you just, you just move in,

51:55.883 --> 51:57.484
and then I go, muah, muah, muah.

51:57.518 --> 51:59.854
- All right, okay, yeah, cool.
- As I, muah, muah, muah.

51:59.887 --> 52:01.656
It's like muah, muah.

52:01.689 --> 52:03.390
- That's really sweet, man.
- It's so sweet.

52:03.423 --> 52:04.559
What about this one though?

52:04.592 --> 52:06.694
Bet he's the worst
of the whole lot, huh?

52:06.728 --> 52:08.228
El Pavo?

52:08.261 --> 52:10.732
Nah, he's like a sidekick.

52:10.765 --> 52:12.634
- Say what?
- A sidekick.

52:12.667 --> 52:14.468
Everybody knows The Bandit
is calling the shots.

52:14.502 --> 52:17.170
- You got something on your...
- No, stop messing with my hair!

52:17.204 --> 52:18.906
- Come on. Just hold still.
- I'm going to be all nerdy!

52:18.940 --> 52:20.240
El Pavo Bebe?

52:21.341 --> 52:23.945
What's that mean, huh?
Why, why do they call him that?

52:23.978 --> 52:26.714
Oh, that means a,
you know, a little turkey.

52:26.748 --> 52:28.650
- Little turkey?
- Bird that can't fly, you know.

52:28.683 --> 52:32.386
- Man!
- In some places pavo means, uh, peacock.

52:32.419 --> 52:33.688
All right, all right, I heard.

52:33.721 --> 52:36.891
He's the bird that can't fly!

52:36.924 --> 52:39.426
'Cause they didn't see me,
'cause if they would've seen...

52:39.459 --> 52:40.728
Oh, shit. Um...

52:42.997 --> 52:44.966
- That's right.
- Take it easy.

52:44.999 --> 52:46.834
All right, all right,
this is a holdup.

52:46.868 --> 52:48.870
- Take it easy.
- Oh, Jesus, he's got a knife.

52:48.903 --> 52:51.606
- Look at him.
- This is a holdup from the, uh,

52:51.639 --> 52:53.708
not the Little Turkey,
that's definitely for sure.

52:53.741 --> 52:55.743
- No, no, no, whoa!
- We're in the paper, man.

52:55.777 --> 52:58.713
- Oh, congratulations!
- Yeah, well, no, no, not congrats!

52:58.746 --> 53:01.582
- They mucked it all up!
- Well, any publicity is good publicity, Scottie.

53:01.616 --> 53:03.918
No, no.
Hey, I'm the Indian Brave!

53:03.951 --> 53:05.820
No, no, no, no, uh,
scratch that.

53:05.853 --> 53:09.389
- I'm the... uh, the Aztec.
- Whatever you say, Pavo.

53:09.423 --> 53:11.592
Not the Pavo! No! I'm, uh,

53:11.626 --> 53:14.428
- the Apache Warrior!
- Oh, that's good, yeah!

53:14.461 --> 53:16.631
Yeah,
I'm the Apache Warrior, man!

53:16.664 --> 53:18.298
And you're scared of me!

53:18.331 --> 53:20.434
And I'm going to take
anything I want, all right?

53:20.467 --> 53:22.570
- Okay.
- I'm going to pay for this though.

53:22.603 --> 53:25.773
- 79 cents.
- 79 cents, what a deal, you guys!

53:25.807 --> 53:28.609
- Oh, my god.
- Big time, baby, big time!

53:28.643 --> 53:30.712
You tell the papers
that you were scared!

53:30.745 --> 53:32.880
You fear my war cry!

53:32.914 --> 53:34.649
- Whoop whoop!
- Oh, boy.

53:34.682 --> 53:36.483
- What? What was that?
- Try it again.

53:36.517 --> 53:38.019
That was not my war cry!

53:38.052 --> 53:40.922
It was a joke, and I was
messing with you 'cause I'm...

53:40.955 --> 53:43.791
- Try again, try it again.
- Yeah, it's like, it's like...

53:47.695 --> 53:48.863
Whoa!

53:50.932 --> 53:53.768
I'll be up front,
don't worry, guys, I got this.

53:53.801 --> 53:55.536
- Officer.
- We can explain everything.

53:55.570 --> 53:57.805
I got them.

54:01.809 --> 54:03.911
You all are stupid!

54:09.483 --> 54:13.688
Don't it make a jackrabbit
spit in a bulldog's face.

54:13.721 --> 54:15.590
What do we have here?

54:16.557 --> 54:17.859
In the flesh.

54:19.527 --> 54:23.698
The Star Spangled Bandit
and The Turkey whatever...

54:23.731 --> 54:26.968
No, man. Apache Warrior.
If you can call me Apache...

54:27.001 --> 54:28.870
Shut up!

54:28.903 --> 54:31.005
You all
are pathetic.

54:31.038 --> 54:33.641
You got see no evil,

54:33.674 --> 54:35.810
speak no evil, and stupid.

54:36.711 --> 54:38.846
I'm sorry that I had
to rain on your parade,

54:38.880 --> 54:41.348
but it is over!

54:41.381 --> 54:44.417
This is bullshit, you know! This guy
on the end, he didn't even do shit!

54:44.451 --> 54:46.721
Yeah, I didn't do anything.
I'm innocent.

54:46.754 --> 54:48.455
- Please let me go.
- It's true, sir.

54:48.488 --> 54:50.490
- Tell it to the judge.
- Don't worry, man,

54:50.525 --> 54:53.594
- I'm not going to let you take the fall for this.
- It's okay, Jack.

54:53.628 --> 54:56.429
I coerced him in to all of that.
I'm sorry about everything.

54:56.463 --> 54:57.965
- It's okay.
- No, it's not!

54:57.999 --> 55:00.001
- No, it's not okay!
- No, no, Jack,

55:00.034 --> 55:01.769
it was a good dream.

55:01.803 --> 55:03.470
I'm sorry they caught us

55:03.504 --> 55:07.041
but we're going to die
in prison together.

55:07.074 --> 55:08.676
We're not
going to prison, Collin.

55:08.709 --> 55:10.077
We're going
to die in prison.

55:10.111 --> 55:11.546
We're definitely
going to prison.

55:11.579 --> 55:13.848
Yeah, your dead mom
would be proud of you.

55:13.881 --> 55:16.751
- I think so, too.
- Yeah, she's smiling from wherever she's buried.

55:16.784 --> 55:19.419
Hey, I think we can get
out of these handcuffs.

55:19.452 --> 55:21.055
- Mm-hmm.
- Use your feet.

55:21.088 --> 55:23.558
- We are at 38 and Main.
- You all aren't magicians.

55:23.591 --> 55:26.794
- No, you'll make things worse!
- Collin, use your feet.

55:26.828 --> 55:28.129
Nope, I don't need no backup.

55:28.162 --> 55:29.730
<i>I don't
need no backup.</i>

55:30.898 --> 55:33.466
<i>Owens,
could you repeat that?</i>

55:33.501 --> 55:36.369
No, I said I'll be back there in
about two shakes of a lamb's ta...

55:36.403 --> 55:38.673
<i>Two shakes
of a lambs tail.</i>

55:38.706 --> 55:40.508
<i>Two shakes of a what?</i>

55:40.541 --> 55:42.076
I'll be back in two
shakes of a lamb's tail.

55:49.817 --> 55:50.751
Owens?

55:59.827 --> 56:02.530
You, you...

56:04.165 --> 56:05.032
and you.

56:05.900 --> 56:07.935
I ain't supposed to talk
to strangers,

56:07.969 --> 56:09.637
so I reckon you can get.

56:11.172 --> 56:12.372
Go!

56:13.541 --> 56:14.709
Go on!

56:21.816 --> 56:25.019
<i>Owens, come in
four-two-seven, over.</i>

56:26.053 --> 56:29.657
<i>And now, Jooly Booly Rogers,</i>

56:29.690 --> 56:31.759
<i>the Mad Dogs' star pitcher,</i>

56:31.792 --> 56:35.730
<i>finally gets his turn at
bat, and he smells blood.</i>

56:35.763 --> 56:37.965
<i>His alligator eyes flashing</i>

56:37.999 --> 56:40.067
<i>as he squares up to the mound.</i>

56:40.101 --> 56:42.970
<i>The wind up,
here comes the pitch.</i>

56:44.639 --> 56:47.642
<i>Into outer space, whoa!</i>

56:47.675 --> 56:50.978
<i>Yes, friends, it is out of here!</i>

56:51.012 --> 56:52.980
<i>Oh, geez.</i>

56:56.250 --> 57:02.657
<i>As we wrap up the eighth, this could be the
end of the road for our hometown heroes.</i>

57:04.759 --> 57:06.694
I heard you like
fireworks, Jack.

57:07.762 --> 57:08.629
Me too.

57:09.830 --> 57:11.098
Back when
I was used to play ball,

57:11.132 --> 57:13.200
they used to bust
so close over my head.

57:13.234 --> 57:14.869
I could feel the heat.

57:16.103 --> 57:17.538
That's all I wanted...

57:19.040 --> 57:20.708
was for Ma to say good game.

57:22.043 --> 57:23.611
That's what them
fireworks meant!

57:35.623 --> 57:37.490
- Hello?
- <i>I got them, Ma.</i>

57:41.796 --> 57:42.797
Put him on.

57:47.101 --> 57:48.135
Jack?

57:49.103 --> 57:51.238
Poor, stupid Jack.

57:51.272 --> 57:53.641
You got a price on your head

57:53.674 --> 57:57.044
higher than
a blue ribbon piggie,

57:57.078 --> 58:02.116
and I'm going to be the one
that brings you in to slaughter.

58:16.630 --> 58:20.001
<i>If you'd like to make a
call, please hang up and try again.</i>

58:20.034 --> 58:23.104
<i>If you need help, hang up,
and then dial your operator.</i>

58:30.311 --> 58:32.713
Hey, you!

58:36.650 --> 58:38.619
Don't, don't do it!

59:05.246 --> 59:07.214
Oh, no. No, no, no.

59:09.083 --> 59:10.918
There you is little cricket.

59:11.852 --> 59:13.654
All nice and sweet.

59:15.623 --> 59:17.224
Why don't you
put that gun down...

59:18.759 --> 59:20.227
before I rip your legs...

59:30.337 --> 59:31.338
Scottie, you okay?

59:31.372 --> 59:32.640
Got to get Jack out of here.

59:32.673 --> 59:34.208
Jack, wake up! Wake up, Jack!

59:34.241 --> 59:37.111
You got to wake up. You got
to wake up, Jack. You got to.

59:38.179 --> 59:40.714
Don't die. Don't die,
you got to wake up.

59:42.116 --> 59:45.186
<i>And so, for one final game,</i>

59:45.219 --> 59:46.287
<i>the Outlaws...</i>

59:46.320 --> 59:48.255
Where we going, fellas?

59:49.256 --> 59:51.292
And where are your bags?

59:54.929 --> 59:56.363
We love trips.

01:00:00.734 --> 01:00:04.271
You and me, man.
San Clemente, San Clemente!

01:00:07.341 --> 01:00:09.844
<i>♪ There's plenty of gold
in world we're told ♪</i>

01:00:09.877 --> 01:00:12.046
<i>♪ On the banks of San Clemente ♪</i>

01:00:31.432 --> 01:00:32.766
Well...

01:00:34.301 --> 01:00:36.704
I don't, I don't really know
if it's for everybody.

01:00:38.105 --> 01:00:42.309
You know, I don't know if
everybody can really go for it.

01:00:42.343 --> 01:00:43.878
Sometimes you just can't.

01:00:43.911 --> 01:00:46.013
Don't quit, don't get stuck.

01:00:46.046 --> 01:00:49.683
No matter what anybody
tells you, keep trying.

01:00:49.717 --> 01:00:51.752
Watch your back,
you know what I'm saying?

01:00:51.785 --> 01:00:53.888
It's a crazy world out there.

01:00:53.921 --> 01:00:55.723
Some girls just
ain't pretty enough.

01:00:56.790 --> 01:01:00.227
It just ain't
in their heritage.

01:01:02.796 --> 01:01:05.132
<i>Gas shortages
are keeping folks off the roads.</i>

01:01:05.166 --> 01:01:06.433
<i>The cost is too high.</i>

01:01:06.467 --> 01:01:08.435
<i>No one wants
to leave their home.</i>

01:01:08.469 --> 01:01:10.971
<i>America,
founded on Westward expansion</i>

01:01:11.005 --> 01:01:13.340
<i>has gone and over
expanded itself.</i>

01:01:13.374 --> 01:01:15.843
<i>Too little jelly
over too much toast.</i>

01:01:15.876 --> 01:01:18.145
<i>And here's our weather report...</i>

01:01:25.986 --> 01:01:28.956
- Where are we, man?
- Outside Santa Fe.

01:01:34.962 --> 01:01:38.232
- Did you kill her?
- She's still out there.

01:01:38.265 --> 01:01:39.266
Got this though.

01:01:41.035 --> 01:01:43.370
- Oh!
- That's a sweet piece of metal, Collin.

01:01:44.438 --> 01:01:46.473
So,
we're friends, right?

01:01:46.508 --> 01:01:49.443
- Collin!
- Uh, yeah, no, man, we're really...

01:01:49.476 --> 01:01:52.780
- We're best friends, Collin.
- Yeah, all right, so I got to thinking last night,

01:01:52.813 --> 01:01:54.014
I had some time to think.

01:01:54.949 --> 01:01:57.351
And you know,
you guys have really put me

01:01:57.384 --> 01:01:58.919
through hell this whole time.

01:01:58.953 --> 01:02:01.822
I mean, all the hold ups,
the hostages, the knife.

01:02:01.855 --> 01:02:04.291
I mean, I'm going to get fired
over this, that's for sure.

01:02:04.325 --> 01:02:05.826
I shot that girl.

01:02:05.859 --> 01:02:08.963
My shoes, my shoes are really
nasty now, you know?

01:02:08.996 --> 01:02:12.066
And all the while, I have to
think, you know, what's happening?

01:02:12.099 --> 01:02:13.234
Am I doing something wrong?

01:02:13.267 --> 01:02:17.004
Am I making these choices
that lead to these situations?

01:02:17.037 --> 01:02:22.076
Am I letting this happen? So, I think
it's time we do something different.

01:02:26.581 --> 01:02:27.915
You going to kill us?

01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:31.952
We're going to Wakeman, boys.

01:02:33.887 --> 01:02:34.888
My man.

01:02:35.823 --> 01:02:38.259
So, uh, Wakeman, huh?
That's interesting.

01:02:38.292 --> 01:02:41.061
You never really told us what
happened with you and your old lady.

01:02:41.095 --> 01:02:43.565
No, no, no, no, no,
I'm a private person

01:02:43.598 --> 01:02:47.301
and we're keeping that private.
Case closed, no way.

01:02:47.334 --> 01:02:48.302
All right.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:52.540
And so she says,
to me, she says,

01:02:52.574 --> 01:02:54.408
"I'm moving to Arizona.

01:02:54.441 --> 01:02:57.311
I want you to move with me."

01:02:59.413 --> 01:03:01.516
- Go with her!
- But I had a good job, you know?

01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:03.484
- Oh!
- I mean, catalogs is good business.

01:03:03.518 --> 01:03:05.219
You said it yourself!
Catalogs is good business!

01:03:05.252 --> 01:03:08.155
You dumb son of a bitch!
Collin, she loves you, man.

01:03:08.188 --> 01:03:09.490
Bang!

01:03:13.528 --> 01:03:15.929
Is that it?
You think that's funny?

01:03:21.135 --> 01:03:22.169
Bang, bang, bang!

01:03:22.202 --> 01:03:23.337
Okay, all right!

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:24.905
Okay, okay, good joke.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.008
Look at
the old Apache Warrior,

01:03:28.042 --> 01:03:29.877
crying like a baby.

01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:31.045
The Baby Pavo!

01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:39.186
Dying ain't much
of a living, boy.

01:03:39.219 --> 01:03:42.089
Round here,
due process is a bullet.

01:03:42.122 --> 01:03:44.191
We deal in lead, friend.

01:03:49.363 --> 01:03:50.497
Aw, hell.

01:03:53.934 --> 01:03:55.035
They ID'd us.

01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:56.604
- What?
- Yeah.

01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:03.911
Uh, hostage identity
still unknown. You're good, man.

01:04:05.412 --> 01:04:07.081
What did it say about me?

01:04:07.114 --> 01:04:09.416
Uh, "Scottie Aldo, 20s,

01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:12.486
indeterminate race,
uh, serial offender."

01:04:14.421 --> 01:04:16.658
Come on, man. Me!

01:04:16.691 --> 01:04:18.926
- Yeah.
- "Scottie Aldo."

01:04:18.959 --> 01:04:22.262
I got my name
in the papers!

01:04:30.672 --> 01:04:33.641
It's the big time, Jack.
That's all we need.

01:04:38.412 --> 01:04:40.548
Go on, Collin, pick them up.

01:04:40.582 --> 01:04:44.918
All right, but only
because I want to pick them up.

01:04:48.389 --> 01:04:50.124
Hey, Jack,
check this out.

01:04:50.157 --> 01:04:51.425
This one goes here

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:53.227
and the big bottle
goes on the big rock.

01:04:54.662 --> 01:04:56.598
Don't shoot him in the...
Scottie, man.

01:04:58.332 --> 01:04:59.400
I seen a bird!

01:05:00.735 --> 01:05:03.303
He looked like he was coming at
you, so I was going to shoot him.

01:05:03.337 --> 01:05:05.906
- Don't shoot me!
- All right, now bend over.

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:29.664
Hello?

01:05:29.697 --> 01:05:32.433
Great thundering
Christ Almighty!

01:05:32.466 --> 01:05:34.201
They was mean,
they shot me, they did.

01:05:34.234 --> 01:05:37.971
Well, then next time,
you shoot them back.

01:05:38.005 --> 01:05:38.939
<i>You hear me?</i>

01:05:42.443 --> 01:05:43.477
<i>Hello?</i>

01:05:43.511 --> 01:05:45.613
Ma, I can't sleep no more.

01:05:45.647 --> 01:05:47.014
Oh, Blue.

01:05:49.517 --> 01:05:50.951
You want a story?

01:05:52.352 --> 01:05:53.353
Yeah.

01:05:56.558 --> 01:05:59.426
Once, there was

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:03.598
a wise, wise king

01:06:03.631 --> 01:06:07.067
who was having trouble
with some wicked peasants.

01:06:08.469 --> 01:06:13.340
So she called on
her favorite knight

01:06:14.274 --> 01:06:17.512
to hunt them dead.

01:06:19.046 --> 01:06:20.113
Okay.

01:06:20.147 --> 01:06:22.049

Aw hell, why you

01:07:59.246 --> 01:08:01.783
Now I got to get
these boys killed.

01:08:01.816 --> 01:08:04.318
Everybody is killing everybody.

01:08:10.357 --> 01:08:12.225
Put out a bulletin
across state lines.

01:08:13.427 --> 01:08:16.229
We need cop cars out,
we need road blocks,

01:08:16.263 --> 01:08:19.801
we need a car at every
gas station this side of Mexico.

01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:20.835
Sure thing.

01:08:29.176 --> 01:08:30.877
All right,
all right, all right.

01:08:30.912 --> 01:08:32.747
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

01:08:33.715 --> 01:08:36.618
Uh, rack my brain,
rack my brain.

01:08:36.651 --> 01:08:38.484
Come on,
buddy, you got this.

01:08:38.519 --> 01:08:40.587
I spy something white.

01:08:40.622 --> 01:08:42.557
All right, is it, uh,
light and fluffy?

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:45.693
- Yeah.
- Is it a cloud?

01:08:45.727 --> 01:08:46.928
That was quick, Collin.

01:08:46.961 --> 01:08:49.897
Well, you know,
you're not very good at this.

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:51.163
My turn.

01:08:51.198 --> 01:08:55.569
I spy with my little eye
something,

01:08:55.603 --> 01:08:57.904
that's trouble, police.

01:08:57.939 --> 01:08:59.874
Whoa, stop the car!

01:08:59.907 --> 01:09:01.341
Okay, we should
probably turn around.

01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:03.210
Oh, no,
we should definitely.

01:09:03.243 --> 01:09:06.313
All right,
I'm just going to back it up.

01:09:06.345 --> 01:09:08.415
Technically no one
guessed police barricade,

01:09:08.448 --> 01:09:10.484
so I still won that round.

01:09:14.522 --> 01:09:16.791
All right,
so what, we wait it out

01:09:16.823 --> 01:09:18.425
or just go back the way we came?

01:09:18.457 --> 01:09:19.661
There's no going back, man.

01:09:19.694 --> 01:09:20.928
She's coming for us,
we're trapped.

01:09:20.962 --> 01:09:22.462
Let's go to Mexico.

01:09:22.496 --> 01:09:24.564
- I know Collin's down.
- I don't like nachos,

01:09:24.599 --> 01:09:26.332
You do like nachos.

01:09:26.366 --> 01:09:27.868
I do not like nachos.
Why do you keep saying...

01:09:27.902 --> 01:09:29.569
Guys, if we go into Mexico
as wanted men,

01:09:29.604 --> 01:09:30.805
there's no coming back.

01:09:30.837 --> 01:09:33.340
That's the point, Jack!
Why would we?

01:09:33.372 --> 01:09:35.743
We could be infamous
banditos, man!

01:09:35.777 --> 01:09:37.545
Butch and Sundance-style!

01:09:39.546 --> 01:09:41.247
We'll go straight through.

01:09:41.281 --> 01:09:43.350
What,
like a blaze of glory?

01:09:43.383 --> 01:09:45.419
Slow and steady,
plain sight.

01:09:45.452 --> 01:09:47.453
They've
seen our faces.

01:09:47.487 --> 01:09:48.523
They know who we are.

01:09:50.758 --> 01:09:51.626
Not Collin.

01:09:53.193 --> 01:09:56.430
- Oh, guys, I don't, I don't know about that.
- No, I know.

01:09:56.463 --> 01:09:58.866
And even if I knew about
that, I mean, they know the car!

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:01.536
I got a plan.

01:10:03.938 --> 01:10:06.574
Oh, wait, Collin,
give me a cigarette real quick.

01:10:06.607 --> 01:10:09.409
Oh, yeah,
I'll be right back.

01:10:09.443 --> 01:10:10.444
He ain't coming back.

01:10:35.402 --> 01:10:36.971
Okay, you can do this.

01:10:37.004 --> 01:10:39.707
You got this. You're just going to drive
up to them and you're going to say,

01:10:39.741 --> 01:10:42.309
"Hey, I'm Collin." And they'll be
like, "Oh, I'm a police officer."

01:10:42.342 --> 01:10:45.479
And then they'll ask for your ID
and you'll give it to them.

01:10:45.513 --> 01:10:47.682
Anything gets into trouble,
you can handle this, Collin.

01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:51.351
Don't throw up. Whatever you do,
don't throw up on them.

01:10:51.384 --> 01:10:54.789
- Give them hell, man.
- No! Don't give them hell, just be cool.

01:10:59.493 --> 01:11:00.762
Just shut up!

01:11:13.107 --> 01:11:14.842
- Howdy.
- Uh, howdy.

01:11:14.876 --> 01:11:19.580
License.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:11:19.614 --> 01:11:24.018
I have that.
I, I have my... just got to...

01:11:24.986 --> 01:11:25.853
It's in here.

01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:28.288
Here you go.

01:11:34.529 --> 01:11:37.532
- Pretty far from home.
- Oh, yeah, um.

01:11:37.565 --> 01:11:39.499
Uh, got a lady in Wakeman.

01:11:39.534 --> 01:11:42.003
Um, everything,
uh, everything all right?

01:11:42.036 --> 01:11:43.571
Everything
all right for you?

01:11:43.604 --> 01:11:45.907
Yeah, no, it's nice.

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:48.308
- A little hot.
- Say, Ed!

01:11:52.513 --> 01:11:53.648
You got to pen?

01:12:11.165 --> 01:12:13.400
- All right then, drive safe.
- You too.

01:12:17.004 --> 01:12:18.105
Just gun it, man!
Just gun it!

01:12:18.139 --> 01:12:19.774
We got a problem, wait a second!

01:12:19.807 --> 01:12:21.142
- Shit, shit.
- Put your hands on the wheel!

01:12:21.175 --> 01:12:22.743
- Okay.
- Put your hands on the wheel, right now!

01:12:22.777 --> 01:12:24.846
Drop it! Drop it!

01:12:24.879 --> 01:12:27.682
What are you doing? No!

01:12:27.715 --> 01:12:30.450
What the hell? Goddammit, dude!

01:12:30.483 --> 01:12:32.687
No, what is this?
This was not the plan!

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.156
- You said gun it, Jack!
- That's not what gun it means!

01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:36.891
Sir, if I said you gun it,
you would think?

01:12:36.924 --> 01:12:38.491
What would you think?
What would you think I meant?

01:12:38.526 --> 01:12:40.895
- Pull out the gun, man!
- No, nobody thinks that!

01:12:40.928 --> 01:12:44.065
- If I...
- Guns and keys, if you please!

01:12:44.098 --> 01:12:46.801
- Guns and keys!
- Jack, it was a little misleading.

01:12:46.834 --> 01:12:48.502
- It was not misleading!
- Everybody knows that gun it...

01:12:48.536 --> 01:12:50.805
- It was very misleading!
- I'm a innocent hostage,

01:12:50.838 --> 01:12:53.541
by the way, officer, and I put my
hands on the wheel like you said.

01:12:53.574 --> 01:12:55.710
- Toss them, toss them!
- Okay, I'm going to toss them.

01:12:55.743 --> 01:12:56.978
- All right.
- There you go.

01:12:57.011 --> 01:12:59.146
Boys, you just been bamboozled

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:02.950
by the one and only,
Apache Warrior!

01:13:02.984 --> 01:13:06.486
Whoa, why are you still doing that?

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.756
All right, Apache Warrior,
I'm giving you my gun.

01:13:08.789 --> 01:13:10.591
- Come on, come on!
- Don't do it, Ed.

01:13:10.625 --> 01:13:12.727
- Don't do it, Ed.
- I'm giving him my gun.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.661
Ed, don't do it.

01:13:16.898 --> 01:13:17.932
Dammit, Ed!

01:13:24.205 --> 01:13:25.907
Glad you're laughing, man.

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:27.174
Glad you think that was funny.

01:13:29.243 --> 01:13:32.146
- You all right?
- Hell, yeah, I'm all right, Jack!

01:13:32.179 --> 01:13:33.180
- Woo!
- You all right, man?

01:13:33.214 --> 01:13:34.916
I'm good.

01:13:34.949 --> 01:13:37.618
Oh, shit, oh, shit!

01:13:37.652 --> 01:13:39.153
Look, it went in one end
and out the other.

01:13:39.186 --> 01:13:42.023
In one end and out the other!
We can fix it, Jack!

01:13:42.056 --> 01:13:43.691
We just plug up the hole,
that's it!

01:13:43.724 --> 01:13:45.458
What? We got to
get him to a hospital.

01:13:45.492 --> 01:13:47.995
If we go to a hospital right
now, they're going to find us!

01:13:48.029 --> 01:13:49.697
Guys, guys, I'm fine.

01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:51.732
I "deal in lead," remember?

01:13:51.766 --> 01:13:53.634
Watch, I can...
Nope, nope, nope.

01:13:53.668 --> 01:13:55.569
Look at this guy,
he's like a fountain!

01:13:55.603 --> 01:13:58.005
I'm just going to, I'm just
going to take a little nap.

01:13:58.039 --> 01:13:59.974
No, stay awake, man!

01:14:00.007 --> 01:14:01.709
- Hey, hey, Collin.
- Wakeman?

01:14:08.215 --> 01:14:09.884
Hey, there's my guy!

01:14:09.917 --> 01:14:11.552
Hey, buddy,

01:14:11.585 --> 01:14:13.154
we're going to get
you to the next town.

01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:17.490
Hey...

01:14:19.026 --> 01:14:20.094
Jack.

01:14:21.929 --> 01:14:22.797
Hey.

01:14:37.912 --> 01:14:39.113
We're going to get
you to a hospital.

01:14:39.146 --> 01:14:40.314
They're going to get you
patched up, all right?

01:14:40.348 --> 01:14:42.883
You're going to be spic'n'span
for your big day with Bohlina.

01:14:42.917 --> 01:14:44.085
- Jack.
- What?

01:14:47.154 --> 01:14:49.256
I'm glad I had to pee
at the Pump N Stump.

01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:19.186
Hey, hey!

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:20.955
Help us!

01:15:20.988 --> 01:15:22.656
Can somebody help us?

01:15:45.312 --> 01:15:47.181
Think he's going
to be all right?

01:15:48.983 --> 01:15:49.917
I don't know.

01:15:52.019 --> 01:15:52.987
Damn.

01:15:54.155 --> 01:15:55.689
I'm going to miss that guy.

01:16:02.963 --> 01:16:04.632
He got blood
all over his tie.

01:16:06.801 --> 01:16:09.637
- Hell of a tie too.
- Hell of a tie.

01:16:18.979 --> 01:16:20.314
What the hell was that, man?

01:16:23.818 --> 01:16:26.754
I was just cleaning up your mess, Jack.
I didn't hurt anyone.

01:16:26.787 --> 01:16:28.289
Yeah, man, people got hurt.

01:16:29.657 --> 01:16:30.624
It wasn't my plan.

01:16:31.792 --> 01:16:32.893
Never is.

01:16:34.061 --> 01:16:35.863
Wasn't Collin's plan either.

01:16:42.136 --> 01:16:43.771
Hey, you know,
if you don't like the plan,

01:16:43.804 --> 01:16:45.706
you don't have to come
along for the plan, man!

01:16:45.739 --> 01:16:47.408
You can get out anytime, man!

01:16:47.441 --> 01:16:48.843
Yeah, you know what, just g...

01:16:50.411 --> 01:16:53.781
Yeah, you know what, screw you, man.
You don't get no gold, or shrimp or...

01:16:55.249 --> 01:16:56.617
or nothing.

01:17:04.158 --> 01:17:06.961
There's
nothing there, man.

01:17:06.994 --> 01:17:10.064
Shrimp pasta sounds
nasty anyway.

01:17:10.097 --> 01:17:11.098
Hey!

01:17:12.299 --> 01:17:13.300
Hey!

01:17:16.137 --> 01:17:17.138
Fuck!

01:17:42.897 --> 01:17:44.231
Maybe next year?

01:17:45.266 --> 01:17:48.202
There's always next year?

01:17:49.737 --> 01:17:51.138
Well, fuck you.

01:17:51.172 --> 01:17:53.741
Good things just don't happen.

01:17:53.774 --> 01:17:55.142
I don't know who told you that.

01:17:55.176 --> 01:17:58.145
Your dreams ain't never
going to come true.

01:17:58.179 --> 01:18:02.783
No, 200 years from now, nobody
is going to know who you were.

01:18:02.816 --> 01:18:04.919
And someday,
you're going to wake up...

01:18:05.953 --> 01:18:09.924
and you're going to realize
that you are a fuck up.

01:18:13.394 --> 01:18:15.029
I don't know, it's like...

01:18:16.363 --> 01:18:18.032
it's like, you roll the dice...

01:18:19.767 --> 01:18:21.035
you pay the price.

01:18:22.236 --> 01:18:23.437
Nothing comes free.

01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:26.140
Nothing comes free
in this world.

01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:18.218
<i>Oh, daggum!</i>

01:20:18.252 --> 01:20:19.486
<i>Looks like it's over</i>

01:20:19.521 --> 01:20:22.122
<i>before it started. What a shame.</i>

01:20:24.058 --> 01:20:25.426
What?

01:20:25.459 --> 01:20:27.861
<i>You win.
I want to end this.</i>

01:20:28.563 --> 01:20:30.164
Well, Jack!

01:20:31.432 --> 01:20:34.536
I am in the presence
of real celebrity!

01:20:34.569 --> 01:20:37.237
<i>You know
what a goddamn honor it is</i>

01:20:37.271 --> 01:20:39.139
<i>to be talking to you, Jack?</i>

01:20:39.173 --> 01:20:41.308
Look, you can have whatever
you want, all right?

01:20:41.342 --> 01:20:43.911
You want, you want money,
I got money for you.

01:20:43.944 --> 01:20:45.580
You want my car?
You can have my car.

01:20:45.613 --> 01:20:47.615
<i>I want you, Jack.</i>

01:20:49.249 --> 01:20:51.085
On a platter.

01:20:51.118 --> 01:20:55.122
Well, uh,
pardon me for saying so

01:20:55.155 --> 01:20:57.291
but that's no way
to make a deal.

01:20:57.324 --> 01:20:58.626
No.

01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:04.231
Oh, you stupid,
dumb, son of a bitch.

01:21:04.264 --> 01:21:06.400
You don't know, do you?

01:21:08.268 --> 01:21:11.338
We got your friend.

01:21:11.372 --> 01:21:14.441
<i>He was trying
to knock over a bank.</i>

01:21:14.475 --> 01:21:18.112
<i>Luckily,
little Blue answered the call</i>

01:21:18.145 --> 01:21:19.514
<i>before the coppers could.</i>

01:21:20.648 --> 01:21:22.883
So, this is what
we're going to do.

01:21:23.951 --> 01:21:27.154
You are going to drive
and meet Blue

01:21:27.187 --> 01:21:31.458
one mile into the desert
off of Exit 70.

01:21:31.492 --> 01:21:32.594
You get Scottie.

01:21:33.528 --> 01:21:34.662
I get you.

01:21:35.597 --> 01:21:39.366
And Blue... gets the gold.

01:21:41.569 --> 01:21:43.337
<i>One hour, Jack.</i>

01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:44.338
<i>Drive safe.</i>

01:21:52.346 --> 01:21:54.616
<i>Grab your grills
and granny too, folks!</i>

01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:58.520
<i>It's clear skies for America's birthday
here in sunny Southern California.</i>

01:21:58.553 --> 01:22:02.423
<i>The firework show starts up behind
Veterans Memorial Airfield at sundown.</i>

01:22:02.456 --> 01:22:05.058
<i>In national news,
after a bungled bank job,</i>

01:22:05.092 --> 01:22:07.729
<i>authorities say they're closing
in on the notorious crime duo</i>

01:22:07.762 --> 01:22:11.432
<i>known as the Star Spangled
Bandit and the Apache Warrior.</i>

01:22:11.465 --> 01:22:13.333
<i>The fate of their
hostage remains unknown.</i>

01:22:13.367 --> 01:22:16.236
<i>Well, folks, that's all
from Breezy Bob McKee.</i>

01:22:35.523 --> 01:22:38.325
Uh, all right, uh, Jack Buckner.

01:22:38.358 --> 01:22:41.328
I was born in Buckatunna but I
live in Aberdeen now, Mississippi.

01:22:41.361 --> 01:22:42.664
Number one thing is to know
what you're doing, man.

01:22:42.697 --> 01:22:46.166
If you don't have a plan,
you got nothing, uh.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.435
Number two thing is to stick with it.
Number three is to find the folks

01:22:48.469 --> 01:22:50.337
who are going to help
you along the way.

01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:52.607
When I was a little kid,
I just figured I had to be a mechanic

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.309
like my pop, you know? Because I
didn't think I had any other shot.

01:22:55.342 --> 01:22:56.578
But the fact
of the matter is this,

01:22:56.611 --> 01:22:58.111
a man can do whatever
he pleases to do.

01:23:01.398 --> 01:23:03.108
Think anyone can
achieve the dream?

01:23:05.587 --> 01:23:06.721
No, it's easy, man.

01:23:08.455 --> 01:23:10.190
You just got to have the balls.

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.341
Why'd you
come back, Jack?

01:24:35.409 --> 01:24:36.443
Bank robbery, huh?

01:24:36.476 --> 01:24:38.111
Did you clean up?

01:24:38.145 --> 01:24:40.447
- While they were closed.
- Oh, shit.

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.382
That's actually
a pretty good idea.

01:24:42.416 --> 01:24:43.685
How'd you do?

01:24:43.718 --> 01:24:44.586
I couldn't get in.

01:24:45.887 --> 01:24:48.088
Oh, closed.

01:24:51.793 --> 01:24:53.761
Shot out every one of them
windows though.

01:24:55.228 --> 01:24:57.364
Looks like
it's time, boys.

01:24:57.397 --> 01:24:59.232
All right, Blue,
all right.

01:25:00.702 --> 01:25:01.636
Square deal.

01:25:02.704 --> 01:25:06.139
You get me, Scottie goes free.

01:25:08.375 --> 01:25:09.544
No, Jack.

01:25:09.577 --> 01:25:12.212
I'm going to shoot you, I is.

01:25:12.245 --> 01:25:13.648
And it's going to be fun too.

01:25:14.616 --> 01:25:16.651
Always wanted to be
a pitcher, I did.

01:25:17.819 --> 01:25:20.387
Ain't it funny how
I became a catcher instead?

01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:25.593
Strike one, you stole
my Ma's money and skipped town.

01:25:30.397 --> 01:25:31.933
Strike three, Jack.

01:25:31.966 --> 01:25:33.501
You talk too much.

01:25:40.942 --> 01:25:43.343
I said there were a lot of
them damn windows, Blue!

01:25:43.377 --> 01:25:45.345
Woo,
that was smooth, man!

01:25:45.379 --> 01:25:49.282
She's out of there!
Who's the umpire now, Blue?

01:25:49.316 --> 01:25:50.685
That was it?

01:25:50.718 --> 01:25:52.219
Come on, boys!

01:25:52.252 --> 01:25:53.420
Go, go,
go, go, go, go!

01:25:53.453 --> 01:25:54.656
Get it!

01:26:02.597 --> 01:26:03.463
Go!

01:26:10.237 --> 01:26:13.206
Woo!

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:14.976
<i>And check
out Jooly Booly on the mound,</i>

01:26:15.009 --> 01:26:17.244
<i>he is spitting mad!</i>

01:26:17.277 --> 01:26:19.881
<i>Here's the pitch and oof!</i>

01:26:19.914 --> 01:26:22.215
<i>Whizzes right by Pops McGee.</i>

01:26:23.951 --> 01:26:25.987
<i>A little too close for comfort.</i>

01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:27.789
<i>Oh, that's strike one.</i>

01:26:35.029 --> 01:26:37.832
<i>And the pitch, low and outside.</i>

01:26:37.865 --> 01:26:39.299
<i>He got him, strike two.</i>

01:26:44.471 --> 01:26:46.406
<i>It's all been fun
and games until now.</i>

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.943
<i>Rogers winding up, here he goes.</i>

01:26:48.976 --> 01:26:51.311
<i>Rockets the ball over the plate.</i>

01:26:51.344 --> 01:26:53.948
<i>A swing and a miss, two outs.</i>

01:26:53.981 --> 01:26:54.949
We're going to die!

01:26:54.982 --> 01:26:56.884
I know!

01:26:56.918 --> 01:26:59.520
But maybe if we
don't want to, I had a thought!

01:26:59.554 --> 01:27:01.022
- Okay!
- Like a plan, Jack.

01:27:01.055 --> 01:27:02.990
If we want to do things
my way for once.

01:27:03.024 --> 01:27:03.958
Okay.

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:06.426
Okay?

01:27:07.895 --> 01:27:08.896
Okay.

01:27:14.301 --> 01:27:17.505
- And when I count to four...
- Four? Why not three?

01:27:17.538 --> 01:27:19.607
- It's my plan Jack, I like four!
- All right, fine,

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.576
just hurry, Scottie.
Go, go, go, go!

01:27:26.748 --> 01:27:28.950
<i>Ocean
City still down by two.</i>

01:27:28.983 --> 01:27:32.687
<i>Two outs,
and all eyes are on Davis.</i>

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:38.325
<i>This could be
the impossible Cinderella story.</i>

01:27:53.107 --> 01:27:54.876
Do it.

01:27:54.909 --> 01:27:56.644
<i>A mad dash for home!</i>

01:27:56.677 --> 01:27:59.013
<i>Chili Bowl Davis
rounding second.</i>

01:27:59.046 --> 01:28:00.748
- <i>The ball is scooped!</i>
- One!

01:28:00.782 --> 01:28:02.517
<i>Davis is going to go for it!</i>

01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:04.585
<i>He's nuts, he's rounding third</i>

01:28:04.619 --> 01:28:06.453
<i>now but here comes the ball!</i>

01:28:06.486 --> 01:28:08.923
Whoo, come on, boys!

01:28:08.956 --> 01:28:10.423
Two!

01:28:10.457 --> 01:28:11.959
<i>On a collision
course with the catcher!</i>

01:28:11.993 --> 01:28:13.326
Three!

01:28:15.963 --> 01:28:17.965
Four.

01:28:17.999 --> 01:28:19.567
<i>Did they get him?</i>

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.803
<i>Did the catcher hang onto it?</i>

01:28:21.836 --> 01:28:23.638
<i>He is...</i>

01:28:24.906 --> 01:28:27.074
<i>...out, out.</i>

01:28:27.108 --> 01:28:31.979
<i>Aw, Jesus, and the outlaws lose.</i>

01:28:32.013 --> 01:28:33.413
Come on out, fellas!

01:28:43.858 --> 01:28:48.663
<i>And Rogers
is getting a hero's ovation.</i>

01:28:50.031 --> 01:28:52.867
<i>Living legend, living legend.</i>

01:29:20.828 --> 01:29:22.462
Christ, it's hot today.

01:29:22.495 --> 01:29:23.363
It's a lot of heat.

01:29:26.033 --> 01:29:27.034
Well.

01:29:29.737 --> 01:29:30.671
Here they come.

01:29:34.474 --> 01:29:37.845
Go get us one of them good spots at the
beach, Jack. I'm gonna go lose them.

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.082
No, no, man, I'll lose them.
You go, all right?

01:29:41.115 --> 01:29:42.683
I'll fight you for it.

01:29:42.717 --> 01:29:44.552
Loser takes the fall.

01:29:44.585 --> 01:29:45.720
Come on.

01:29:46.954 --> 01:29:49.090
Apache Warrior
squares up with him.

01:29:49.123 --> 01:29:50.691
One, one, two!

01:29:50.725 --> 01:29:51.626
That was a hard hit.

01:29:51.659 --> 01:29:52.827
Here he comes again!

01:29:53.828 --> 01:29:55.630
He's a maniac! He's crazy!

01:29:56.631 --> 01:29:57.698
Good hit, good hit!

01:29:57.732 --> 01:29:59.567
One, one, two!

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.135
Oh, wait, he's shook.

01:30:01.168 --> 01:30:03.104
Lightning Jack sees his opening!

01:30:03.137 --> 01:30:04.672
Apache Warrior isn't ready.

01:30:04.705 --> 01:30:05.673
The hit, here it comes!

01:30:05.706 --> 01:30:08.075
And the hit!

01:30:13.014 --> 01:30:14.115
You got me.

01:30:15.216 --> 01:30:16.984
I guess I got to go
take the fall now.

01:30:18.953 --> 01:30:20.922
I'm going to go get
my face in them papers.

01:30:23.024 --> 01:30:24.424
It's going to look good too.

01:30:26.928 --> 01:30:30.598
And you,
you go get your shrimp pasta!

01:30:54.956 --> 01:30:57.124
<i>Pull over, stop the vehicle.</i>

01:30:58.926 --> 01:31:01.595
Woohoo!

01:31:29.056 --> 01:31:33.661
<i>♪ Nothing is the same now
nothing ♪</i>

01:31:36.664 --> 01:31:40.835
<i>♪ No one is so safe now no one ♪</i>

01:31:43.838 --> 01:31:48.209
<i>♪ There's so much I don't know
so much ♪</i>

01:31:51.212 --> 01:31:53.114
<i>♪ Nothing is the same now... ♪</i>

01:31:53.147 --> 01:31:54.915
Scottie!

01:31:54.949 --> 01:31:56.550
Mr. Scottie, Mr. Scottie!

01:31:59.687 --> 01:32:01.188
<i>Scottie!</i>

01:32:05.026 --> 01:32:06.761
<i>Mr. Scottie, Mr. Scottie!</i>

01:32:06.794 --> 01:32:08.696
<i>You're the talk of the town!</i>

01:32:10.798 --> 01:32:11.932
You know what?

01:32:11.966 --> 01:32:14.668
Bad dogs never get
put down easy.

01:32:14.702 --> 01:32:16.971
We apprehended
the Apache Warrior,

01:32:17.004 --> 01:32:19.106
but the Star Spangled Bandit,

01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:23.110
well, we found pieces
of his body exploded

01:32:23.144 --> 01:32:25.212
all over the middle
of the desert.

01:32:28.883 --> 01:32:30.317
You get what you put in.

01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:34.088
Damn shame.

01:32:39.927 --> 01:32:42.263
Sometimes, what you
wanted wasn't the best thing

01:32:42.296 --> 01:32:44.065
or even the right thing.

01:32:44.098 --> 01:32:45.833
You just got to go for it.

01:32:45.866 --> 01:32:50.738
Hope that somehow, in the end,
it all works out.

01:32:52.239 --> 01:32:53.841
I don't think just anybody

01:32:53.874 --> 01:32:55.376
can achieve their dream,
you know?

01:32:55.409 --> 01:32:58.646
I think... it takes
a little something,

01:32:58.679 --> 01:32:59.847
it takes a little heart.

01:33:00.781 --> 01:33:03.084
Um, I mean,
everybody's got heart,

01:33:03.117 --> 01:33:06.320
but... I guess
not everybody uses it.

01:33:08.022 --> 01:33:10.124
Some people be thinking
with their heads too much.
