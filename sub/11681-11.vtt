<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.556 --> 00:07.091
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.159 --> 00:09.527
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.594 --> 00:12.196
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.264 --> 00:14.565
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.633 --> 00:16.600
Where am I?
Miami.

00:16.668 --> 00:19.837
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.905 --> 00:22.473
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.541 --> 00:24.074
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.142 --> 00:25.709
Should we shoot them?

00:25.777 --> 00:28.279
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.346 --> 00:30.648
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.715 --> 00:33.184
<i>..Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.251 --> 00:35.352
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.420 --> 00:37.855
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.923 --> 00:39.523
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

<i>Forging an intelligence file</i>
<i>is always tricky.</i>

00:51.570 --> 00:54.805
<i>Spies are trained to catch</i>
<i>even tiny inconsistencies,</i>

00:54.873 --> 00:56.340
<i>from outdated typeface</i>

00:56.408 --> 00:59.009
<i>to the wrong kind</i>
<i>of thermochromatic ink.</i>

00:59.077 --> 01:00.845
<i>Even the folder needs</i>
<i>to be picture-perfect,</i>

01:00.912 --> 01:02.413
<i>because the fact is,</i>

01:02.480 --> 01:05.215
<i>spies</i> do <i>judge books</i>
<i>by their covers.</i>

01:05.283 --> 01:06.383
So, here's the story.

01:06.451 --> 01:08.252
This report came
from a Navy buddy

01:08.320 --> 01:09.653
who's serving in Japan,

01:09.721 --> 01:11.488
where they still use
the old-school Pentagon folders.

01:11.556 --> 01:13.557
And I happened
to have one.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.526
So, thank God
for government inertia, huh?

01:15.594 --> 01:18.195
But Jesse's been working
on this investigation for years.

01:18.263 --> 01:19.663
Well, everything
<i>he</i> was looking into

01:19.731 --> 01:21.098
and all the stuff
<i>we</i> found --

01:21.166 --> 01:22.733
this little baby
connects all the dots.

01:22.801 --> 01:24.501
It's your masterwork, Sam.

01:24.569 --> 01:25.803
I owe you mojito.
Damn straight.

01:25.871 --> 01:28.405
Before we start
patting ourselves on the back,

01:28.473 --> 01:30.674
can we talk about
what we're doing to Jesse?

01:30.742 --> 01:32.076
Fi, Jesse's seen a <i>lot</i>
<i>of bad things happen</i>

01:32.143 --> 01:33.377
to a <i>lot</i> of good people.

01:33.445 --> 01:34.678
He just wants a name,

01:34.746 --> 01:35.946
and we're just gonna give him
that name.

01:39.251 --> 01:41.652
"John Barrett."

01:41.720 --> 01:42.820
God, why didn't I
put this together?

01:42.888 --> 01:43.854
John Barrett.

01:45.490 --> 01:47.224
It's great cover running
a telecom conglomerate.

01:47.292 --> 01:49.627
It gets Barrett into
every corner of the globe.

01:49.694 --> 01:51.362
Massive resources, highest level
government access.

01:51.429 --> 01:52.429
It's a nice perch
for a guy

01:52.497 --> 01:53.764
looking to start
a few little wars

01:53.832 --> 01:54.498
and make a buck
off it.

01:54.566 --> 01:55.966
This is...

01:56.034 --> 01:57.601
I mean, I was looking
at private military companies,

01:57.669 --> 01:58.602
arms dealers,
retired spooks.

01:58.670 --> 02:00.004
I should've been...

02:00.071 --> 02:02.606
Watching the guy
who was laying the phone lines.

02:02.674 --> 02:04.475
Where do I send
my "thank you" note?

02:04.542 --> 02:06.143
Oh, a buddy of mine
stationed in Japan.

02:06.211 --> 02:07.945
He, uh, didn't even know
what he had there.

02:08.013 --> 02:10.146
All right, man.

02:10.215 --> 02:11.582
Drake Tech's based
in New York, right?

02:11.650 --> 02:12.716
Let's head up there,

02:12.784 --> 02:14.385
let Barrett know
his number's up.

02:14.452 --> 02:15.853
Why go to where
he's strongest?

02:15.921 --> 02:17.187
We have what he wants.

02:17.255 --> 02:18.956
Better to make him
come to us.

02:19.024 --> 02:20.624
What, do you want
to call him up,

02:20.692 --> 02:22.693
let him know he's got a bible
he's been looking for?

02:22.761 --> 02:24.328
Yep. That's exactly
what <i>I</i> was thinng.

02:27.098 --> 02:28.666
What?

02:28.733 --> 02:30.067
I'm having friends over
to play cards.

02:30.135 --> 02:31.168
It's my turn to host.

02:32.337 --> 02:33.771
Oh, that must be Suzie.

02:33.838 --> 02:35.973
Uh, well, I guess it's time
to go someplace

02:36.041 --> 02:37.942
where you won't be interrupted
by Canasta.

02:41.246 --> 02:42.813
Three years.

02:42.881 --> 02:45.649
It's over a thousand days, man.
Here it is.

02:45.717 --> 02:46.817
Are you sure about this?

02:46.885 --> 02:48.319
You sure you want to
play it straight?

02:48.386 --> 02:49.286
Well, there's no point
lying to a man

02:49.354 --> 02:50.688
with Barrett's resources.

02:50.755 --> 02:53.257
We're just two burned spies
selling a book code.

02:53.325 --> 02:54.325
You ready?

02:55.627 --> 02:56.593
Yes.

03:03.168 --> 03:04.234
Hello?

03:04.302 --> 03:05.636
Mr. Barrett.
Michael Westen.

03:05.704 --> 03:08.005
Sorry to bother you
on your private line,

03:08.073 --> 03:10.641
but I have
this odd-looking bible.

03:10.709 --> 03:12.109
I've been flipping
through it,

03:12.177 --> 03:14.178
and it appears to be
a book code.

03:14.245 --> 03:16.080
Is that at all interesting
to you?

03:19.250 --> 03:21.251
Can you please
excuse me?

03:21.319 --> 03:23.020
This'll just take a sec.

03:32.197 --> 03:34.531
My wife doesn't even
have this number.

03:34.599 --> 03:35.733
How'd you get it?

03:35.800 --> 03:37.401
You want to talk
about your wife

03:37.469 --> 03:39.136
not having
your unlisted number

03:39.204 --> 03:41.205
or the book code
you've been robbing banks

03:41.272 --> 03:42.506
and killing people
to find?

03:42.574 --> 03:43.974
Who is this?

03:44.042 --> 03:45.442
I used to work
for the government.

03:45.510 --> 03:46.510
So did my partner,

03:46.578 --> 03:47.644
Jesse Porter.

03:47.712 --> 03:48.779
Now we're working
freelance.

03:48.847 --> 03:50.247
Thought
you might be hiring.

03:50.315 --> 03:52.216
And just what is it
you boys think I do?

03:52.283 --> 03:54.218
Don't waste our time,
Mr. Barrett.

03:54.285 --> 03:55.586
You're a merchant
of death.

03:55.653 --> 03:57.021
And business is booming.

03:57.088 --> 03:58.422
You have
the wrong number, son.

03:58.490 --> 04:00.758
And you have the wrong man.

04:00.825 --> 04:03.260
I run a telecom company.

04:07.599 --> 04:09.066
Well, the bible's here
in Miami.

04:09.134 --> 04:10.968
Whenever you're ready to talk,
let us know.

04:16.374 --> 04:17.940
That could have
gone better.

04:18.009 --> 04:19.910
Well, it went as well
as it needed to.

04:19.978 --> 04:21.879
All right.
Barrett wants the bible.

04:21.946 --> 04:24.381
If he can't deal for it,
he'll try to steal it.

04:24.449 --> 04:28.085
A man like that,
he's already tracking us down.

04:29.454 --> 04:31.188
Yeah.

04:34.144 --> 04:35.264

04:45.970 --> 04:48.572
So, you and Jesse are poking
Barrett with a stick.

04:48.624 --> 04:50.959
Why does the phrase
"sitting ducks" come to mind?

04:50.968 --> 04:53.369
Jesse and I are
pretty well-armed "ducks."

04:54.013 --> 04:55.514
I hope so.

04:55.581 --> 04:56.715
Hello, Fiona.

04:56.783 --> 04:57.916
Well, hello.

04:59.352 --> 05:01.453
Hi, mom.

05:01.521 --> 05:03.322
You know, I ordered you
an iced tea, but if you want --

05:03.389 --> 05:06.291
I scored 1,420 points
at Canasta yesterday, Michael.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.961
That's...Wonderful?

05:09.028 --> 05:10.462
It's horrible!

05:10.530 --> 05:12.097
I was distracted.
I was nervous.

05:12.165 --> 05:13.765
I've been a wreck.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.033
What's wrong, Madeline?
Sit down.

05:15.868 --> 05:17.135
I'm not staying for lunch.

05:17.203 --> 05:19.504
I only asked you all
to meet me here

05:19.572 --> 05:21.373
because it's too risky
to talk to my son

05:21.441 --> 05:22.674
in my own home.

05:22.742 --> 05:24.743
This is about Jesse.

05:24.811 --> 05:26.044
Made me sick --

05:26.112 --> 05:27.946
watching you feed him
that line of B.S.

05:28.014 --> 05:29.014
In my house yesterday.

05:29.082 --> 05:30.849
I don't want to keep him
in the dark,

05:30.917 --> 05:32.417
but it's for
his own good.

05:32.485 --> 05:34.653
Oh, and you're the one
who gets to determine that?

05:34.721 --> 05:36.455
This'll all be over soon.
Trust me.

05:36.522 --> 05:37.656
Well, it better be.

05:40.693 --> 05:42.361
Mom.

05:42.428 --> 05:44.196
I want to thank you <i>again</i>

05:44.263 --> 05:46.832
for suggesting
Jesse live with her.

05:46.899 --> 05:49.768
Yeah. It may not have been
one of my better ideas.

05:49.836 --> 05:50.936
Well, if lunch is off,

05:51.004 --> 05:52.838
then I should go talk
to my new client.

05:52.905 --> 05:54.473
You're taking on a client
in the middle of all this?

05:54.540 --> 05:56.441
Well, just a friend of a friend
from yoga.

05:56.509 --> 05:58.343
The woman was seduced
by a scam artist.

05:58.411 --> 05:59.611
He took
her life savings.

05:59.679 --> 06:01.947
Don't worry.
I'm not asking you for help.

06:02.015 --> 06:03.815
The guy's
a sleazy womanizer --

06:03.883 --> 06:05.984
clearly a job
for Sam Axe.

06:09.522 --> 06:10.756
After my husband died,

06:10.823 --> 06:12.758
I didn't think
I'd ever date again.

06:12.825 --> 06:14.493
But then Charles
came along.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.894
I thought,
"well, he's no Josh,

06:15.962 --> 06:17.963
but he likes
all my low-fat recipes."

06:18.031 --> 06:20.899
I should've known.

06:20.967 --> 06:22.234
You can't
beat yourself up.

06:22.301 --> 06:24.269
The bastard told you
what you wanted to hear.

06:24.337 --> 06:25.637
He was good.

06:25.705 --> 06:27.839
Those eyes,
british accent...

06:27.907 --> 06:29.508
All those lies.

06:29.575 --> 06:31.176
Yep. He sounds slick.

06:31.244 --> 06:32.711
So how'd he get
your money?

06:32.779 --> 06:34.312
Well, I trusted him.

06:34.380 --> 06:36.982
Things were getting
serious -- I thought.

06:37.050 --> 06:39.184
And he offered
to help me invest.

06:39.252 --> 06:41.086
And then he used
your account info

06:41.154 --> 06:43.055
to help himself
to your savings.

06:43.122 --> 06:45.457
We're not gonna let him
get away with this.

06:45.525 --> 06:48.326
I even hired a couple
of private investigators.

06:48.394 --> 06:51.029
One of them actually quit
after he met Charles.

06:51.097 --> 06:53.098
Said he seemed like
a nice guy.

06:54.801 --> 06:57.035
Now I'm selling off my life
piece by piece

06:57.103 --> 06:58.904
While that bastard

06:58.971 --> 07:02.040
is partying on South Beach
with my savings.

07:02.108 --> 07:04.643
Well, you know, it's hard to
party with broken kneecaps.

07:04.710 --> 07:06.545
Actually, I think we should
fight fire with fire.

07:06.612 --> 07:09.614
Charles isn't the only charmer
in Miami.

07:17.523 --> 07:19.458
I still think we should
go after Barrett directly

07:19.525 --> 07:20.625
in New York, man.

07:20.693 --> 07:22.661
Yeah, let's call that
plan..."Z."

07:22.728 --> 07:23.829
Trust me.

07:23.896 --> 07:25.730
Barrett wants
the bible.

07:25.798 --> 07:27.199
He's gonna send someone
after it.

07:27.266 --> 07:28.400
I don't mind
being the bait,

07:28.468 --> 07:29.468
as long as the trap
is good enough.

07:32.405 --> 07:34.506
<i>An effective booby trap</i>

07:34.574 --> 07:36.875
<i>not only needs to look</i>
<i>like a good hiding spot,</i>

07:36.943 --> 07:39.845
<i>it also needs to leave</i>
<i>your enemy incapacitated.</i>

07:39.912 --> 07:41.847
<i>A well-placed</i>
<i>50-gallon oil drum</i>

07:41.914 --> 07:43.815
<i>should pique</i>
<i>your target's curiosity.</i>

07:43.883 --> 07:46.284
<i>And a portable defibrillator</i>
<i>packs enough punch</i>

07:46.352 --> 07:49.721
<i>to make their heart skip a beat</i>
<i>without stopping it entirely.</i>

07:49.789 --> 07:52.891
<i>Wire the defibrillator</i>
<i>to a convincing decoy,</i>

07:52.959 --> 07:55.494
<i>and whoever comes looking</i>
<i>will be in for a shock.</i>

07:57.196 --> 07:58.463
<i>Connect a camera wirelessly</i>

07:58.531 --> 08:00.332
<i>through an internet</i>
<i>phone provider,</i>

08:00.399 --> 08:02.067
<i>and you'll be able to keep</i>
<i>an eye on your trap</i>

08:02.135 --> 08:03.602
<i>from anywhere in the world,</i>

08:03.669 --> 08:05.303
<i>without having to pay</i>
<i>long distance.</i>

08:05.371 --> 08:07.038
<i>How's the Skype working?</i>

08:07.106 --> 08:08.106
Looks good.

08:10.710 --> 08:12.878
Are you sure
Barrett's up on that cell?

08:12.945 --> 08:14.346
This burner
we called him with

08:14.413 --> 08:15.847
is made by a company
he owns.

08:15.915 --> 08:18.116
Any idiot would know
to tap and trace the phone.

08:18.184 --> 08:19.684
Barrett's not an idiot.

08:22.255 --> 08:23.188
What now?

08:23.256 --> 08:24.523
We wait...

08:26.359 --> 08:27.926
...While Barrett comes looking
for this.

08:29.529 --> 08:31.796
Why do I get the feeling Sam's
having more fun than we are?

08:36.869 --> 08:39.203
Okay, Fi.
You got eyes on him?

08:39.272 --> 08:40.572
Yep.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.274
Just like Emily said --

08:42.341 --> 08:43.642
there's Charles,

08:43.708 --> 08:45.243
blowing
her life savings.

08:45.311 --> 08:47.812
Yeah. Except I don't think
he's spent a dime.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.681
I think he's got a new fish
on the line.

08:49.749 --> 08:52.217
Well, he is the one man
from England with decent teeth.

08:53.719 --> 08:56.788
So our con man's pretty clean,
since showing up stateside.

08:56.856 --> 08:58.590
Got an allegation of fraud
up in Boca,

08:58.658 --> 09:01.159
but nothing really stuck
except for a couple of D.U.I.'s.

09:01.227 --> 09:02.761
I couldn't find any
back accounts, either.

09:02.828 --> 09:03.995
And yet he has
an Interpol file.

09:04.063 --> 09:06.064
Yeah, turns out
he's not just a fraud,

09:06.132 --> 09:07.465
he's a suspected killer.

09:07.533 --> 09:09.134
Couple of women he bilked
in England went missing

09:09.202 --> 09:10.669
when they complained.

09:10.736 --> 09:12.871
So he doesn't just steal
from defenseless women,

09:12.939 --> 09:14.105
he murders them.

09:14.173 --> 09:15.707
That son of a bitch.

09:15.775 --> 09:18.210
Not this time.

09:18.277 --> 09:19.811
We're gonna introduce him
to a new kind of trouble.

09:19.879 --> 09:20.946
I don't know.

09:21.013 --> 09:22.647
This fella is gonna be
a challenge.

09:22.715 --> 09:24.883
I think it's time for
some Chuck Finley action.

09:24.951 --> 09:28.086
His name is Charles.
You need a new cover I.D.

09:28.154 --> 09:29.821
Sorry, Fi.
I don't think so.

09:29.889 --> 09:31.223
Chuck Finley is forever.

09:50.142 --> 09:51.743
Excuse me.
I don't mean to interrupt,

09:51.811 --> 09:53.278
but her feet
are killing her.

09:53.346 --> 09:55.046
Any way we can just sit down
with you for just a couple secs?

09:55.114 --> 09:56.881
Actually,
this is a private area, so...

09:56.949 --> 09:58.383
Oh, Charles,
don't be silly.

09:58.451 --> 10:00.452
Those heels are hot,
but they look positively evil.

10:00.519 --> 10:01.620
Sit down.

10:03.256 --> 10:04.589
Thanks.

10:04.657 --> 10:05.924
I'm Chuck.
This is Alexis.

10:05.992 --> 10:07.592
Lindsey and Charles.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.361
Cheers.
Hey.

10:09.428 --> 10:10.428
Wow.

10:10.496 --> 10:11.963
Bollinger blanc.
Good stuff.

10:12.031 --> 10:13.531
Charles and I
are splurging.

10:13.599 --> 10:15.200
Oh, us too!

10:15.268 --> 10:17.068
South Beach
is so much fun!

10:17.136 --> 10:19.271
I just flew in
from San Francisco.

10:19.338 --> 10:20.805
I was chartering a yacht
when I met Chuck!

10:20.873 --> 10:22.507
And he is
showing me around!

10:26.512 --> 10:28.046
Well, isn't that nice.

10:28.114 --> 10:29.781
Hey. Tell you what.

10:29.849 --> 10:30.682
Next bottle's on me.

10:32.685 --> 10:36.054
So, I said, "not if that's
your idea of a haircut!"

10:37.356 --> 10:38.256
Right?
Do you get it?

10:41.894 --> 10:44.095
I have to powder my nose.
Will you come with me?

10:46.098 --> 10:47.899
Oh, Chuck.

10:47.967 --> 10:49.167
Don't get lost.

10:52.238 --> 10:54.172
So, Chuck.

10:54.240 --> 10:55.740
What is it that you do?

10:55.808 --> 10:57.509
Investments.
Just like you.

10:57.576 --> 10:59.577
You never know
who's gonna pay off.

10:59.645 --> 11:02.681
Afraid I don't follow.

11:02.748 --> 11:04.983
Normally I work Boca,

11:05.051 --> 11:07.819
but I have heard some legendary
stories about <i>you,</i> my friend.

11:07.887 --> 11:10.255
Hey. Relax.

11:10.323 --> 11:12.223
I'm not here to horn in
on any of your action.

11:12.291 --> 11:13.858
You can have any woman
in this club.

11:13.926 --> 11:16.628
I just need some help
with Alexis.

11:16.696 --> 11:18.129
She's rich, divorced.

11:18.197 --> 11:20.465
Just what are you
proposing?

11:20.533 --> 11:22.133
Well, she's a couple of nights
of passion away

11:22.201 --> 11:23.368
from paying out
big-time.

11:23.436 --> 11:24.502
But I got the IRS
breathing down my neck.

11:24.570 --> 11:25.804
I can't move a dime.

11:25.871 --> 11:28.606
I was hoping maybe you would
let me run her fortune

11:28.674 --> 11:29.908
through your accounts.

11:32.211 --> 11:34.612
You want to use my accounts?

11:34.680 --> 11:36.514
Quite a set of bollocks
on you.

11:36.582 --> 11:38.683
Cut you in 20%
for an hour's work.

11:38.751 --> 11:40.485
I don't do business
like that.

11:40.553 --> 11:41.753
I'm a lone wolf, mate.

11:41.821 --> 11:43.488
Isn't Charles sweet?

11:43.556 --> 11:45.724
Yeah. Almost too good
to be true.

11:45.791 --> 11:47.759
How long have
you been dating?

11:47.827 --> 11:48.993
Just a few weeks.

11:49.061 --> 11:51.029
I am so lucky
to have found him.

11:52.331 --> 11:54.399
Or maybe he found <i>you.</i>

11:54.467 --> 11:56.000
Must have been fate.

11:56.068 --> 11:59.137
I was so devastated
after my sister passed.

11:59.205 --> 12:02.440
And he works with this
cancer-research charity.

12:02.508 --> 12:03.375
Hmm.

12:05.945 --> 12:08.680
This is the last time
you show your face in this club.

12:08.748 --> 12:10.181
This is my turf.

12:10.249 --> 12:12.050
Okay, you drive
a hard bargain.

12:12.118 --> 12:13.084
30%.

12:13.152 --> 12:14.853
Hey.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.254
So sorry, love.

12:16.322 --> 12:17.555
I just got a business call
from London.

12:17.623 --> 12:18.757
We really should run.

12:18.824 --> 12:19.924
Really?
I was hoping --

12:19.992 --> 12:21.426
we <i>really</i> should go.

12:21.494 --> 12:23.528
Lovely meeting you.

12:23.596 --> 12:26.631
That son of a bitch is preying
on another grieving woman.

12:26.699 --> 12:29.300
Please tell me you got
his account information.

12:29.368 --> 12:31.002
No. The limey
is totally charm-proof.

12:31.070 --> 12:33.705
Oh. Well, let's see
if he's bulletproof.

12:35.808 --> 12:37.175
Fi!

12:37.243 --> 12:38.977
If this --
Look, you had your chance!

12:39.044 --> 12:41.112
I'm gonna beat Emily's money
out of him.

12:41.180 --> 12:44.048
<i>Spies spend plenty of time</i>
<i>with sociopaths and criminals.</i>

12:44.116 --> 12:46.251
<i>But sometimes</i>
<i>it's even more dangerous</i>

12:46.318 --> 12:47.752
<i>to hang out</i>
<i>with their victims.</i>

12:47.820 --> 12:50.188
<i>Letting your emotions</i>
<i>get the best of you</i>

12:50.256 --> 12:51.956
<i>can threaten</i>
<i>the entire operation.</i>

12:52.024 --> 12:53.191
You're <i>not</i> going
after him!

12:53.259 --> 12:54.526
Get your hands off me!

12:54.593 --> 12:57.228
Sticking a gun to his head
is not gonna help!

12:57.296 --> 12:59.130
He is prepared for that!
Believe me!

12:59.198 --> 13:01.833
Now, we will get
her money back.

13:01.901 --> 13:03.034
I promise, Fi.

13:05.404 --> 13:07.605
If we don't,
I will shoot him,

13:07.673 --> 13:09.340
and then I'll shoot you!

13:15.000 --> 13:16.133
Hey.

13:16.201 --> 13:17.268
Where's Sam?

13:18.467 --> 13:19.934
Oh, Sam and I are, uh...

13:20.002 --> 13:21.903
We're taking a break
from each other.

13:21.971 --> 13:23.204
This is Michael.

13:23.272 --> 13:25.273
It's good to meet you.
Nice boat.

13:25.341 --> 13:26.641
Thanks.

13:26.709 --> 13:28.910
My husband and I
built her together, actually.

13:28.978 --> 13:30.679
That's why she's named
<i>"Back Pain".</i>

13:30.746 --> 13:34.149
Don't do this, Emily.
We're gonna get your money back.

13:34.216 --> 13:35.150
Things went well
with Charles?

13:35.217 --> 13:36.651
Uh, not exactly.

13:36.719 --> 13:39.120
Charles is
extremely careful.

13:39.188 --> 13:40.989
But we might have
a new angle.

13:41.057 --> 13:42.924
You know how you're not supposed to mix
prescription medication

13:42.992 --> 13:44.492
with alcohol?

13:44.560 --> 13:46.361
Charles is gonna make
that mistake with Lorazepam.

13:46.429 --> 13:47.729
Wait a second.
You're drugging him?

13:47.797 --> 13:49.230
Well, there's --
there's got to be another way

13:49.298 --> 13:50.565
you can get him
to tell you the truth.

13:50.633 --> 13:52.367
Well, we're not drugging him
to make him talk.

13:52.435 --> 13:54.002
We're drugging him
so that he blacks out.

13:54.070 --> 13:55.403
And when
Charles wakes up,

13:55.471 --> 13:57.772
Sam will convince him he went
on a crazy spending spree.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.274
He'll want to check
his balance...

13:59.342 --> 14:00.675
...And we'll be watching
when he does.

14:00.743 --> 14:03.511
That plan sounds insane.

14:03.579 --> 14:05.313
Well, "insane" is one
of our specialties.

14:17.526 --> 14:18.827
Charles.

14:21.464 --> 14:22.897
Could I have made it
more clear

14:22.965 --> 14:24.032
that this was my turf?!

14:24.100 --> 14:25.600
No, no, no.
You were very clear.

14:25.668 --> 14:28.870
Look, I'm about to wrap things
up with Alexis and blow town.

14:28.938 --> 14:30.338
But before I did,
I just wanted to drop off

14:30.406 --> 14:32.607
a token of respect.

14:32.675 --> 14:34.609
Just consider this the --
the King's hunting tax,

14:34.677 --> 14:35.744
if you will.

14:35.811 --> 14:37.979
"King's hunting tax"?

14:38.047 --> 14:39.314
Look.

14:39.382 --> 14:40.482
I wandered onto your turf,

14:40.549 --> 14:41.916
and I just wanted to say
I'm sorry.

14:41.984 --> 14:44.486
So, no hard feelings?

14:44.553 --> 14:46.187
As long as you're
leaving town.

14:46.255 --> 14:47.555
Oh, that I am.

14:47.623 --> 14:49.791
Hope you like that timepiece,
'cause I had to earn it.

14:49.859 --> 14:52.160
Alexis is
a real ball-buster.

14:52.228 --> 14:53.762
You know, I'm all set
to bleed her dry

14:53.829 --> 14:55.196
by the end of the week,

14:55.264 --> 14:57.198
but every moment until then
is like

14:58.534 --> 14:59.667
Well, there's nothing
more pathetic

14:59.735 --> 15:00.635
than a bitch
who can't move on.

15:00.703 --> 15:01.970
Amen to that, brother.

15:02.037 --> 15:04.139
I have a, uh, mate
across the pond

15:04.206 --> 15:06.107
who disposes
of the clingy ones

15:06.175 --> 15:07.642
once he's wrung 'em out.

15:07.710 --> 15:08.643
A mate?

15:08.711 --> 15:09.778
Right.

15:09.845 --> 15:11.312
Let me buy you a drink.

15:13.149 --> 15:14.249
Cheers.

15:19.922 --> 15:22.290
<i>To create a blank spot</i>
<i>in someone's memory,</i>

15:22.358 --> 15:24.526
<i>you need to be equal parts</i>
<i>drinking buddy</i>

15:24.593 --> 15:25.894
<i>and amateur chemist.</i>

15:25.961 --> 15:28.296

15:30.699 --> 15:31.866
<i>At the same time,</i>

15:31.934 --> 15:33.401
<i>you need to gauge</i>
<i>their tolerance</i>

15:33.469 --> 15:36.004
<i>so you can combine just</i>
<i>the right amount of alcohol</i>

15:36.071 --> 15:39.407
<i>with just the right amount</i>

15:39.475 --> 15:42.410
Come on.
Bottoms up.

15:43.579 --> 15:45.079
A night to remember!

15:45.147 --> 15:46.114
Cheers!

15:46.182 --> 15:47.315
Cheers.

15:56.392 --> 15:57.826
Yep. He's still out.

15:57.893 --> 15:58.893
Thank you.

15:58.961 --> 16:00.228
Now, do that
one more time,

16:00.296 --> 16:01.830
and I might forgive you
for the other night.

16:10.206 --> 16:11.406
Happy now?

16:11.474 --> 16:13.107
Anything useful
on his phone?

16:13.175 --> 16:14.175
No.

16:14.243 --> 16:15.743
But now it has a bug.

16:15.811 --> 16:18.713
I sent that Lindsey woman
a little message.

16:18.781 --> 16:20.615
Uh-oh. Did Charles
drunk-text her?

16:20.683 --> 16:22.517
He may have accidentally
revealed his plans

16:22.585 --> 16:23.685
to rip her off.

16:23.752 --> 16:25.386
She sent him a text back

16:25.454 --> 16:26.821
saying she never wants to see him again.
Oh, well.

16:26.889 --> 16:27.889
Okay, let's get down
to business.

16:27.957 --> 16:29.157
When Charles wakes up,

16:29.225 --> 16:31.259
he will have had
one hell of a night.

16:35.998 --> 16:38.700
Every step of our investigation
has been like pulling teeth.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.502
Stalled out for weeks
and then -- boom --

16:40.569 --> 16:43.371
Sam's buddy just happens to be
sitting on the magic bullet.

16:43.439 --> 16:45.206
We had the problem
surrounded.

16:45.274 --> 16:47.609
There aren't two other people
on the planet

16:47.676 --> 16:50.345
who'd know that that file
connects to Barrett.

16:50.412 --> 16:53.081
Yeah. I'm just asking,
how reliable is Sam's friend?

16:53.148 --> 16:55.016
You know?

16:55.084 --> 16:56.484
Maybe we should test him,

16:56.552 --> 16:58.586
slip him a lead from CIFA,
see if --

16:58.654 --> 17:00.188
Jesse, we talked
to Barrett.

17:00.256 --> 17:02.390
<i>He's</i> the guy
who wants the bible.

17:02.458 --> 17:03.925
Do we really need more
confirmation than that?

17:03.993 --> 17:05.425
I mean -- hold on.

17:05.493 --> 17:06.594
We have a guest.

17:06.662 --> 17:09.696
Well, hello!

17:09.765 --> 17:11.965
That's it, Buddy.
You're getting warmer.

17:12.034 --> 17:16.003
Maybe the bible
is in that oil drum.

17:16.070 --> 17:17.805
Warmer.

17:20.175 --> 17:21.577
Yeah. Even warmer.

17:21.906 --> 17:22.906
Getting hot.

17:27.715 --> 17:29.083
Burnt.
Bam.

17:32.555 --> 17:35.089
Hands! Hands!
No, no, no! Hands up!

17:35.157 --> 17:35.757
Hands up!

17:35.824 --> 17:37.825
Thank you.

17:37.893 --> 17:39.494
That was close, Buddy.

17:39.562 --> 17:41.329
You almost stole
our phonebook.

17:42.798 --> 17:44.832
You have <i>no</i> idea
who you're messing with.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.935
Well, whose fault is that? You haven't
told us your name yet.

17:47.002 --> 17:49.938
And until we get a chance
to chat with your bosses,

17:50.005 --> 17:51.739
you're a guest
at the abandoned boathouse.

17:54.510 --> 17:55.543
His phone's clean.

17:57.012 --> 17:58.980
Guess we get to spend
more time in the sweat box

17:59.048 --> 18:00.782
guarding him till his superiors
call to check in.

18:00.849 --> 18:03.418
Actually, I'm supposed to go
help Fi and Sam with a gig.

18:03.485 --> 18:05.053
Unless <i>you</i> want to go.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.421
I did take the last shift.

18:07.590 --> 18:08.923
I'll pick up
more bug spray.

18:15.431 --> 18:16.631
Okay, it's been 12 hours.

18:16.699 --> 18:18.733
Time to wake up
sleeping beauty.

18:18.801 --> 18:19.834
Mike there yet?

18:19.902 --> 18:21.202
He's running late.

18:21.270 --> 18:23.204
It's a pity we have to wake up
Charles at all.

18:23.272 --> 18:26.074
Uh, dead guys are much less
likely to visit a bank, Fi.

18:30.512 --> 18:32.447
Hello.

18:32.514 --> 18:33.715
Ooh, you survived the mosquitos.
Barely.

18:35.050 --> 18:37.185
All right, Sam.
Get him moving.

18:41.357 --> 18:45.326
Whoo!
Rise and shine, big boy!

18:45.394 --> 18:46.527
Time to shake it off!

18:47.496 --> 18:48.997
Wild night, huh, Chaz?

18:49.064 --> 18:50.498
Have a cup of Joe!

18:53.502 --> 18:55.336
What are you doing
in my house?!

18:55.404 --> 18:56.871
Good morning to you, too.

18:56.939 --> 18:59.307
Whatever happened to
"friends till death"?

18:59.375 --> 19:00.441
What the hell?

19:00.509 --> 19:01.676
Last I remember,

19:01.744 --> 19:03.277
you were leaving Miami.

19:03.345 --> 19:04.846
Someone needs
practice drinking.

19:04.913 --> 19:07.315
I mean, how many did you
even have last night?

19:07.383 --> 19:10.284
Look, if you don't remember
the French deejay,

19:10.352 --> 19:11.786
tell me you at least
remember the Brazilian chicks

19:11.854 --> 19:12.887
from the after-party?

19:12.955 --> 19:15.423
After-party?
Oh, come on.

19:15.491 --> 19:17.592
Or how about when we were
hauling ass in your new car

19:17.660 --> 19:18.626
and you jumped the curb?

19:18.694 --> 19:20.428
What new car?

19:23.499 --> 19:25.566
Where the hell did <i>this</i>
<i>come from?!</i>

19:25.634 --> 19:27.602
Uh, you bought it,
Buddy.

19:27.670 --> 19:29.170
You backed into it
on Ocean Drive.

19:29.238 --> 19:30.371
The guy jumps out
screaming,

19:30.439 --> 19:31.739
"you dented my car!"

19:31.807 --> 19:33.775
And you said, "no, mate.
I dented <i>my</i> car."

19:33.842 --> 19:35.510
And you bought it off him
on the spot.

19:35.577 --> 19:36.678
It was epic.

19:36.745 --> 19:38.279
I bought this Bentley
last night?

19:38.347 --> 19:40.481
Yeah. You ran off yelling
about some account,

19:40.549 --> 19:42.583
and you came back
with a bag of cash.

19:42.651 --> 19:44.919
I got to tell you --
you know how to party.

19:44.987 --> 19:46.254
Where's my Lexus?

19:46.321 --> 19:47.722
Where's my wallet?

19:47.790 --> 19:49.190
Maybe your wallet's
in your Lexus.

19:49.258 --> 19:51.592
What the bloody hell
is going on here?!

19:51.660 --> 19:52.794
Anyone ever tell you

19:52.861 --> 19:54.195
you're a lot more fun
when you're drunk?

19:54.263 --> 19:55.697
Hey, hair of the dog
is what <i>you</i> need.

19:55.764 --> 19:56.898
Shut up! Piss off!
Get out! Okay?

19:56.905 --> 19:59.106
I've got some things
to get sorted!

19:59.174 --> 20:00.942
Uh, does this mean
we're not gonna pick up

20:01.009 --> 20:02.944
those new suits
you ordered for us?

20:03.011 --> 20:04.111
Well...

20:04.179 --> 20:05.546
All right.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.451
Game time.

20:34.343 --> 20:36.210
Reynolds & Pederson.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.645
He's heading
to a law firm?

20:37.713 --> 20:40.815
We need to talk, Martin!

20:40.882 --> 20:42.717
<i>I don't see the point of...</i>

20:42.784 --> 20:44.118
<i>Money manager...</i>

20:44.186 --> 20:45.953
<i>Charles, I'm in the middle</i>
<i>of something.</i>

20:46.021 --> 20:47.321
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

20:47.389 --> 20:48.990
<i>Don't I pay you to...</i>

20:49.057 --> 20:50.524
<i>Some judgment?</i>

20:50.592 --> 20:52.393
Sounds like the juicy part.
We got to get closer.

20:56.331 --> 20:59.967
<i>Tell me how I got the cash</i>
<i>to buy a Bentley last night.</i>

21:00.035 --> 21:01.469
<i>What are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

21:01.536 --> 21:03.170
<i>I went on a bender</i>

21:03.238 --> 21:05.906
<i>and wound up</i>
<i>with a shiny, new...</i>

21:05.974 --> 21:07.041
Bentley, you wanker!

21:11.613 --> 21:14.048
Nobody here gave you a damn thing.
Really?

21:14.116 --> 21:16.450
Where do you think I get
the money to pay for that,

21:16.518 --> 21:17.685
you half-wit?!

21:17.753 --> 21:19.487
<i>Let the grown-ups talk.</i>

21:19.554 --> 21:21.455
<i>Get ahold of yourself.</i>

21:21.523 --> 21:24.358
This is why you don't handle
the accounts.

21:24.426 --> 21:26.494
You start drinking,
and you lose your head.

21:26.561 --> 21:29.296
Don't worry.
Your money's safe.

21:29.364 --> 21:30.798
Tony.

21:30.866 --> 21:32.967
Head out to the front lawn,
check out that blue car.

21:33.035 --> 21:34.735
Is there any chance
you were followed here?

21:34.803 --> 21:36.404
We got to go.

21:36.471 --> 21:38.239
<i>When your surveillance</i>
<i>is about to be blown,</i>

21:38.306 --> 21:39.540
<i>you have two choices.</i>

21:39.608 --> 21:41.108
<i>You can run,</i>

21:41.176 --> 21:42.710
<i>or you can stay put</i>

21:42.778 --> 21:44.412
<i>and make it look like</i>
<i>you have a reason to be there.</i>

22:06.668 --> 22:07.935
What?!

22:08.003 --> 22:09.603
Hey. Take that
somewhere else.

22:09.671 --> 22:11.305
A guy can't make out
with his girlfriend?

22:17.312 --> 22:18.312
Okay. That was...

22:18.380 --> 22:19.980
Purely tactical.

22:20.048 --> 22:22.116
Yes. Yes, it was.

22:23.518 --> 22:24.685
We should go.

22:24.753 --> 22:25.553
Yes.

22:27.425 --> 22:29.745
So, our friend Barry says,
Charles has a kinda of

22:29.869 --> 22:31.803
Underworld money manager
handling his cash.

22:31.871 --> 22:34.072
He's got hundreds
of offshore accounts.

22:34.140 --> 22:35.840
Even if we knew which one
had your money,

22:35.908 --> 22:38.009
only Charles and this Martin
character can make withdrawals.

22:38.077 --> 22:39.010
That's the bad news.

22:39.078 --> 22:40.345
Well, the bad news is,

22:40.413 --> 22:42.447
it looks like I'm moving back in
with my mother.

22:42.515 --> 22:43.915
Well, we have an angle.

22:43.983 --> 22:46.818
Charles is very, very worried
about guarding his money.

22:46.886 --> 22:48.186
And with
a little pushing,

22:48.254 --> 22:50.355
we can turn his concern
for his financial security

22:50.423 --> 22:51.523
into full-blown paranoia.

22:51.590 --> 22:52.657
He gets paranoid enough,

22:52.725 --> 22:54.326
he's gonna start looking
for help.

22:54.393 --> 22:56.227
Right. And that's when we bring
in our Buddy Mike to help.

22:56.295 --> 22:57.762
What Mike's gonna do is
he's gonna make it clear

22:57.830 --> 22:59.331
that the only way
he can help

22:59.398 --> 23:01.433
is if Charles shows him exactly
where he keeps the money.

23:03.069 --> 23:06.471
Do you guys have like a manual
where you get this stuff

23:06.539 --> 23:08.173
or something?
No.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.909
Mostly we just make it up
as we go.

23:10.977 --> 23:12.043
There you are.

23:12.111 --> 23:14.012
What the hell did you
get me into?

23:14.080 --> 23:15.780
What are you
going on about?!

23:15.848 --> 23:18.183
They are following me!

23:18.250 --> 23:20.618
Dreadfully sorry,
my loves.

23:20.686 --> 23:21.987
Be right back.

23:22.054 --> 23:23.722
Just what are you
talking about?

23:23.789 --> 23:25.090
Have you gone mad?

23:25.157 --> 23:26.758
I'm telling you --
they are <i>after</i> me.

23:26.826 --> 23:28.693
Ever since you and I
hung out the other night,

23:28.761 --> 23:30.895
there has been a little blue
Hyundai all over my ass.

23:30.963 --> 23:33.631
One of my men thought a blue car
was following me.

23:33.699 --> 23:34.766
Well, there you go.

23:34.834 --> 23:36.034
But it turned out
to be nothing,

23:36.102 --> 23:37.369
just a couple snogging
in the alley.

23:37.436 --> 23:38.737
Huh?

23:38.804 --> 23:40.472
You know, making out.

23:40.539 --> 23:41.639
Really?

23:41.707 --> 23:42.741
Point is,

23:42.808 --> 23:44.409
they <i>weren't</i> following me.

23:44.477 --> 23:45.677
Of course
they were making out.

23:45.745 --> 23:46.811
That was just their cover.

23:46.879 --> 23:48.480
That's the oldest trick
in the book.

23:48.547 --> 23:50.415
I'm telling you, they're after both of us.
No.

23:50.483 --> 23:53.184
I have been careful.
There is nothing to worry about.

23:53.252 --> 23:54.786
You've got to take
this seriously, Chaz.

23:54.854 --> 23:56.554
This could be a jealous husband.
No!

23:56.622 --> 23:59.958
I am going to relax
and work on my tan.

24:00.026 --> 24:01.426
Good luck, mate.

24:07.433 --> 24:08.500
Hey. How'd it go?

24:08.567 --> 24:09.968
Okay. Yeah.
I planted the seed.

24:10.036 --> 24:11.970
How's it coming
with our not-so-sneaky bug?

24:12.038 --> 24:13.304
Don't rush me, Sam.

24:13.372 --> 24:15.940
Jesse just got here
with Madeline's old stereo.

24:16.008 --> 24:17.108
Yeah. Uh, hey, Fi.

24:17.176 --> 24:18.376
Speaking of Jesse,

24:18.444 --> 24:20.578
when you were following
Charles...

24:20.646 --> 24:21.746
I'll call you
when we're done, Sam.

24:26.685 --> 24:27.886
All right.
So...

24:27.953 --> 24:29.788
Let's give Charles something
to worry about.

24:32.658 --> 24:34.626
<i>There's an art to building</i>
<i>a listening device</i>

24:34.693 --> 24:36.528
<i>that's meant to be discovered.</i>

24:36.595 --> 24:38.596
<i>It's not enough for it</i>
<i>to look like a bug.</i>

24:38.664 --> 24:41.766
<i>It needs to have a fatal flaw</i>
<i>to make sure someone finds it,</i>

24:41.834 --> 24:43.635
<i>like a high-frequency</i>
<i>transmitter</i>

24:43.702 --> 24:45.837
<i>that causes</i>
<i>ear-splitting feedback</i>

24:45.905 --> 24:48.139
<i>when placed near</i>
<i>other electronics.</i>

24:53.212 --> 24:54.846
I should get going.

24:54.914 --> 24:57.048
This bug isn't gonna plant itself.
Right.

24:57.116 --> 24:58.683
Yeah, I'm gonna head back
to the boathouse,

24:58.751 --> 25:00.418
help Michael babysit
our captive.

25:01.921 --> 25:03.755
So I'm just gonna...

25:03.823 --> 25:04.923
Yeah.
Yep.

25:10.529 --> 25:13.064
How'd the bug-building go
with Fi?

25:14.200 --> 25:15.467
If Charles can't find
that thing,

25:15.534 --> 25:17.035
he's more of a dumb-ass
than we thought.

25:17.103 --> 25:19.104
Here we go.

25:19.171 --> 25:20.505
Hello?

25:20.573 --> 25:22.373
Where have you been?
You were supposed to check in.

25:22.441 --> 25:24.642
This is Michael Westen
and Jesse Porter.

25:24.710 --> 25:26.678
We're your boss's
new business associates.

25:26.745 --> 25:29.013
Where's Colonel Russell?

25:29.081 --> 25:31.149
You guys have a <i>Colonel</i>
<i>running your errands?</i>

25:31.217 --> 25:32.851
What are you --
just listen to me.

25:32.918 --> 25:34.819
We're sending Colonel Russell
back to you

25:34.887 --> 25:36.521
with some photocopied pages
from the bible.

25:36.589 --> 25:38.156
The sneak preview
should make it very clear.

25:38.224 --> 25:39.891
We have the rest.

25:39.959 --> 25:42.060
You send any more of your little thieves for
it, we're gonna burn it.

25:42.128 --> 25:44.629
You tell Mr. Barrett to come on down to Miami
like we asked him to.

25:44.697 --> 25:45.697
Do I need to
repeat myself?

25:45.764 --> 25:46.698
No.

25:46.765 --> 25:47.899
Good.

25:47.967 --> 25:49.000
Talk to you soon.

25:50.369 --> 25:52.137
Active duty, huh?

25:52.204 --> 25:53.938
I'm sure Uncle Sam
would be happy to hear

25:54.006 --> 25:56.040
that you're taking side gigs
to make a quick buck.

25:56.108 --> 25:57.475
Don't try
to blackmail me.

25:57.543 --> 25:58.576
Of course not.

25:58.644 --> 25:59.811
But you need
to remember

25:59.879 --> 26:01.679
which boss
you're taking these to.

26:01.747 --> 26:04.115
These pages go right
to the big guy in New York.

26:04.183 --> 26:05.350
He's expecting you soon.

26:06.685 --> 26:08.553
You know you're kicking
a hornet's nest, right?

26:08.621 --> 26:09.721
Oh!

26:09.788 --> 26:10.989
Suddenly
he's Mr. Talkative.

26:11.056 --> 26:13.258
Drive safe.

26:13.325 --> 26:15.360
Nicely done.

26:15.427 --> 26:17.195
I'd say we should
call up Sam,

26:17.263 --> 26:18.730
see if he wants
to go get a drink,

26:18.797 --> 26:21.766
but, uh, he's probably lost
his taste for alcohol.

26:29.808 --> 26:30.808
Chaz!

26:30.876 --> 26:31.910
I was just about
to call you!

26:31.977 --> 26:33.111
You were right, mate.

26:33.179 --> 26:34.479
They're after me, too.

26:34.547 --> 26:36.381
I just found a bug
in my new car!

26:36.448 --> 26:37.549
You know what?
That's nothing.

26:37.616 --> 26:38.716
There's a hundred k's

26:38.784 --> 26:40.351
missing from
my offshore account.

26:40.419 --> 26:42.153
And you know who knew
I had money in Aruba?

26:42.221 --> 26:43.388
Hmm? Nobody.

26:43.455 --> 26:44.522
I told my money manager,

26:44.590 --> 26:46.024
but he thought
I was talking rubbish!

26:46.091 --> 26:48.259
What the hell would a money
manager know about this? Huh?

26:48.327 --> 26:49.260
This is hardcore!

26:49.328 --> 26:50.228
No, no, no, no.

26:50.296 --> 26:51.529
I'm gonna call a guy

26:51.597 --> 26:53.264
who knows how to handle
this kind of crap.

26:53.332 --> 26:54.599
To go after your money?

26:54.667 --> 26:56.868
No, to go after the people
who are hunting us!

26:56.936 --> 26:58.503
Look. Meet me
at the Sagamore,

26:58.571 --> 27:00.872
and bring that little bug thing
that you found, okay?

27:03.075 --> 27:04.108
Brilliant.

27:06.512 --> 27:09.047
This is your guy
who handles stuff?

27:09.114 --> 27:11.583
You didn't tell me
he was a dirty cop.

27:11.650 --> 27:13.117
Well, he's just
sorta kinda a cop.

27:13.185 --> 27:14.886
It's all right.
I don't mind the word "dirty."

27:14.954 --> 27:16.287
Okay, so, look.

27:16.355 --> 27:18.122
This is my account
in Aruba.

27:18.190 --> 27:20.091
You see those
transaction codes?

27:20.159 --> 27:21.459
The bastards bled me dry.

27:21.527 --> 27:23.094
And you said
they were following you.

27:23.162 --> 27:24.195
Yeah, in a blue Hyundai.

27:24.263 --> 27:25.530
They bugged my new car.

27:26.665 --> 27:28.600
Probably come after
your money next.

27:28.667 --> 27:31.336
Give me your bank info, and I'll
cut them off at the pass.

27:31.403 --> 27:32.704
No. I have people
watching my accounts.

27:32.771 --> 27:34.172
What I need <i>you</i> to do --

27:34.240 --> 27:36.207
Oh, are you
gonna tell me what to do,

27:36.275 --> 27:37.542
your majesty?

27:37.610 --> 27:41.579
Oh, you're the expert
on how to catch bad guys.

27:41.647 --> 27:43.348
Well, you don't need <i>me,</i> then.

27:43.415 --> 27:44.682
Look, no offense, mate.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.918
I just don't ever give out
my bank in--

27:46.986 --> 27:48.219
yeah. Fine.
Beach is that way.

27:48.287 --> 27:49.621
Go stick your head
in the sand.

27:49.688 --> 27:52.523
You told me
he was on board!

27:52.591 --> 27:54.158
Hey, it's not <i>my</i> problem

27:54.226 --> 27:57.061
if you two want to get
financially disemboweled!

27:57.129 --> 27:58.263
But I came all the way
down here --

27:58.330 --> 28:00.231
okay. Okay.

28:00.299 --> 28:02.300
I'll get the info
for you.

28:02.368 --> 28:04.969
But you better catch
these guys.

28:05.037 --> 28:06.371
And I want them
to suffer.

28:10.709 --> 28:11.909
Martin.

28:11.977 --> 28:13.077
Charles.

28:13.145 --> 28:14.579
Listen.

28:14.647 --> 28:18.149
I'm hiring someone
to find out who's been spying --

28:18.217 --> 28:20.318
excuse me?

28:20.386 --> 28:22.754
Oh, that bitch.

28:24.423 --> 28:25.590
Okay.

28:25.658 --> 28:27.292
Mm. Sounds good.

28:27.359 --> 28:29.360
Well, <i>that's</i> odd.

28:29.428 --> 28:31.696
Seems like my man
has sorted things.

28:31.764 --> 28:34.299
Sorted how?

28:34.366 --> 28:35.933
Chuck,
can I have a moment?

28:41.840 --> 28:43.508
My money man

28:43.575 --> 28:44.976
has found out
who's been after us.

28:45.044 --> 28:46.778
It's this bitch I fleeced
about a month ago.

28:46.845 --> 28:48.713
Turns out
she's been hiring P.I.'s.

28:48.781 --> 28:49.947
Must have seen us
together.

28:50.015 --> 28:51.616
Okay, well,
that's fine.

28:51.684 --> 28:53.718
We'll have Brooks over there
just deal with her --
no. No.

28:53.786 --> 28:55.153
I've been told not to worry
about her.

28:55.220 --> 28:56.921
I've got a ticket to Rio.
I'm getting out of town.

28:56.989 --> 28:58.489
Wait a second.
You drag me into this,

28:58.557 --> 28:59.624
and now you're just
gonna skip town?

29:01.026 --> 29:02.427
Oh, I know.
I feel dreadful about it, mate.

29:02.494 --> 29:03.961
Tell you what --

29:04.029 --> 29:06.931
I've got a few promising
prospects I can throw your way.

29:06.999 --> 29:08.766
Make your money back
in no time.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.902
Stop by first thing.

29:14.440 --> 29:16.074
He's going to Rio.

29:16.141 --> 29:17.041
Mike, this is not good.

29:17.109 --> 29:18.109
Good luck, then.

29:18.177 --> 29:19.811
That was Fi.
Emily just called.

29:19.878 --> 29:22.647
A couple of guys just showed up
outside her house with guns.

29:22.715 --> 29:23.748
She's hiding in the closet.

29:40.099 --> 29:41.399
<i>Whenever possible,</i>

29:41.467 --> 29:43.701
<i>it's best to avoid</i>
<i>charging into a building</i>

29:43.769 --> 29:45.636
<i>filled with angry men</i>
<i>with guns.</i>

29:45.704 --> 29:47.939
<i>If going in</i>
<i>is your only option,</i>

29:48.006 --> 29:50.842
<i>you choose the best place</i>
<i>to stage an ambush,</i>

29:50.909 --> 29:52.243
<i>lock and load,</i>

29:52.311 --> 29:53.644
<i>and get your enemies</i>
<i>to come to you.</i>

30:04.089 --> 30:05.490
That was the garage door.

30:05.557 --> 30:06.758
Somebody's here.

30:06.825 --> 30:08.292
<i>Police breaching techniques</i>

30:08.360 --> 30:10.595
<i>generally involve</i>
<i>removing a door by its hinges</i>

30:10.662 --> 30:12.597
<i>or knocking it open</i>
<i>with a battering ram.</i>

30:12.664 --> 30:15.166
<i>Military breaching techniques</i>
<i>are more aggressive.</i>

30:15.234 --> 30:16.768
<i>They don't just try</i>
<i>to get by the door.</i>

30:16.835 --> 30:18.269
<i>They use it as a weapon.</i>

30:25.010 --> 30:26.511
Aah!

30:26.578 --> 30:27.945
Beanbag rounds
hurt like a bitch.

30:28.013 --> 30:29.380
Am I right?

30:29.448 --> 30:31.149
Emily!

30:31.216 --> 30:32.183
It's clear.

30:38.981 --> 30:40.581
How much
is my life worth?

30:40.649 --> 30:42.683
How much did Charles
pay you?!

30:42.751 --> 30:43.951
He didn't send them.

30:44.019 --> 30:45.887
His money guy's
in clean-up mode.

30:45.954 --> 30:47.321
Charles is
skipping town.

30:47.389 --> 30:48.556
He's heading to Rio.

30:48.624 --> 30:50.057
Are you kidding me?

30:50.125 --> 30:51.525
That bastard's going to Rio?

30:51.593 --> 30:53.060
Don't worry.
He's not gonna make it.

30:53.128 --> 30:55.062
Sam's intercepting him
before he catches his flight.

30:55.130 --> 30:56.998
He's going to have
another wild night

30:57.065 --> 30:58.065
before heading
out of town.

30:58.133 --> 30:59.433
When he wakes up,

30:59.501 --> 31:00.668
he's going to have
a serious mess to cover up.

31:00.736 --> 31:02.536
About that --

31:02.604 --> 31:04.538
I know you said you didn't want
to part with your boat.

31:04.606 --> 31:07.074
Whatever it takes
to stop Charles...

31:07.142 --> 31:08.276
I'll do it.

31:17.519 --> 31:20.354
As promised.

31:20.422 --> 31:23.224
If you can't make
your hundred grand back

31:23.292 --> 31:24.392
fleecing <i>those</i> marks,

31:24.459 --> 31:25.993
it's your own
bloody fault, mate.

31:26.061 --> 31:27.161
Happy hunting.

31:27.229 --> 31:28.195
To the hunt?

31:28.263 --> 31:29.630
Actually,

31:29.698 --> 31:32.300
I'm swearing off alcohol
for a bit.

31:32.367 --> 31:35.469
Chaz, I don't even know
what those words mean.

31:35.537 --> 31:36.637
Buddy...

31:39.641 --> 31:40.541
Cheers.

31:42.177 --> 31:43.778
Mmm.

31:43.845 --> 31:46.380
The one on top --

31:46.448 --> 31:48.749
widow in Coral Gables.

31:48.817 --> 31:50.484
She should be
worth 2 1/2.

31:50.552 --> 31:52.753
She just won a lawsuit
against some chemical company

31:52.821 --> 31:54.755
that killed her kid.

31:54.823 --> 31:57.458
Charles, you're a real peach.

32:03.365 --> 32:05.933
<i>You're a real peach.</i>

32:22.884 --> 32:24.552
Oh, my God!

32:30.025 --> 32:31.692
Oh, my God.

32:39.134 --> 32:41.102
There you are!
Come on. Let's go!

32:41.169 --> 32:42.903
Wait! Wait!
What in the hell is going on?!

32:42.971 --> 32:44.839
Would it have killed you
to just snap her neck?

32:44.906 --> 32:46.640
What? What the hell are you
talking about?!

32:46.708 --> 32:48.876
Oh, no. Don't tell me
you've had another blackout.

32:48.944 --> 32:50.011
Did I?

32:50.078 --> 32:51.479
I-I killed...

32:51.546 --> 32:53.180
I killed Emily?
No.

32:53.248 --> 32:54.548
You called me screaming
to save your ass

32:54.616 --> 32:55.649
'cause you got
a parking ticket.

32:55.717 --> 32:57.585
Of course
you killed Emily!

32:57.652 --> 32:59.253
You gave her a friggin'
Viking funeral!

32:59.321 --> 33:01.188
Now, come on. Look.
We got to go.

33:01.256 --> 33:02.390
My Buddy's waiting.
Let's go.

33:02.457 --> 33:03.624
By "your buddy"
you mean your dirty cop!

33:03.692 --> 33:05.126
Don't you remember
anything?

33:05.193 --> 33:07.528
Yes! Yes! The guy that you
begged me to bring in!

33:07.596 --> 33:09.597
No...Yes.

33:09.664 --> 33:10.965
O-okay.
Yeah. Come on.

33:11.033 --> 33:12.600
Yes. Yeah.

33:12.667 --> 33:14.135
He can fix this?
Yeah.

33:14.202 --> 33:15.436
Ain't gonna be easy,
and it ain't gonna be cheap.

33:15.504 --> 33:16.837
I don't care.

33:16.905 --> 33:20.307
If he can clean this up,
I'll pay him whatever he wants.

33:23.211 --> 33:24.412
A million dollars?!

33:24.479 --> 33:26.313
That's my Sunday special!

33:26.381 --> 33:28.582
Cops are picking apart
the crime scene!

33:28.650 --> 33:30.151
DNA is on its way
to the lab!

33:30.218 --> 33:31.519
You're covered in blood!

33:31.586 --> 33:34.989
You want to guess how many palms
I got to grease?!

33:35.057 --> 33:36.490
Look, I can get you
half a million.

33:36.558 --> 33:38.359
Half a million.
Are you negotiating with me?

33:38.427 --> 33:39.527
Are you negotiating
with me?

33:39.594 --> 33:41.295
A million is too much!

33:41.363 --> 33:43.097
I'd rather run for it.

33:43.165 --> 33:44.231
Great idea!

33:44.299 --> 33:46.200
Fugitives escape
all the time!

33:46.268 --> 33:47.768
Lady-killer here
is going to prison.

33:47.836 --> 33:49.770
I'd distance myself.

33:51.039 --> 33:53.407
Wait! Whoa! Wait!

33:53.475 --> 33:55.543
Look, I'm not cut out
for prison.

33:55.610 --> 33:59.280
You have to make this...
Go away.

34:01.983 --> 34:03.984
I'll get the million!

34:04.052 --> 34:05.786
You get a million dollars,

34:05.854 --> 34:08.322
I will backdate a ticket
to Tahiti,

34:08.389 --> 34:10.958
like this chick Emily's
skipping town.

34:11.025 --> 34:12.960
It'll look like she blew up
her boat

34:13.027 --> 34:14.328
for some
fraud insurance claim.

34:14.396 --> 34:15.963
Good. Good.

34:16.031 --> 34:17.797
Brilliant.
That'll work.

34:19.301 --> 34:20.568
Martin.

34:20.635 --> 34:21.702
It's Charles.

34:21.770 --> 34:23.170
No. Shut up and listen!

34:23.237 --> 34:24.938
I'm draining my account.

34:25.005 --> 34:26.674
I need every cent of it,

34:26.741 --> 34:28.876
including your share!

34:28.944 --> 34:32.713
Don't you play the "crazy" card
with me, you bloody tosser.

34:32.781 --> 34:34.514
If I don't have it all...
"Tosser"?

34:34.583 --> 34:35.983
...Within the hour,

34:36.051 --> 34:37.451
I'm going to the police,

34:37.518 --> 34:39.820
and I'm going to tell them
your nasty little secrets!

34:39.888 --> 34:41.856
One hour, Martin!

34:48.663 --> 34:50.331
All good?
My money man --

34:50.398 --> 34:51.599
I owe him a percentage,

34:51.666 --> 34:53.333
but I know where his bodies
are buried.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.469
He knows what happens
if he doesn't come through.

34:55.536 --> 34:57.771
You know, there's a flight
to Rio in three hours.

34:57.839 --> 34:59.006
Why don't I get us
a limo?

34:59.074 --> 35:00.174
We can both
go cool off.

35:00.242 --> 35:01.175
Rio.

35:01.243 --> 35:03.310
Of course.

35:14.523 --> 35:17.158
30% of this is <i>my</i> money,
Charles.

35:17.225 --> 35:19.460
Nobody blackmails me
and gets away with it.

35:19.528 --> 35:20.728
That's tough talk

35:20.795 --> 35:22.730
for a glorified accountant,
Martin.

35:22.797 --> 35:24.532
You're lucky I don't kill you
right here

35:24.599 --> 35:27.601
just for that weasel look
on your face.

35:29.204 --> 35:30.471
See you when I see you.

35:37.612 --> 35:40.214
$1 million.

35:40.282 --> 35:43.951
Now, make this all
go away.

35:44.019 --> 35:45.686
By the time I'm done,

35:45.754 --> 35:47.955
it'll be like this
never happened.

35:49.724 --> 35:52.092
Who says you can't
get away with murder?

35:52.160 --> 35:53.661
Ahh!
It feels liberating.

35:53.728 --> 35:54.929
Ha ha.

35:54.996 --> 35:56.330
Hey, you know,
speaking of that,

35:56.398 --> 35:58.032
there's a few things
I wanted to mention to you.

35:58.099 --> 35:59.934
First of all, I figured out
why you're blacking out.

36:00.001 --> 36:01.735
Oh, thank you, Detective.
I know.

36:01.803 --> 36:03.270
I've been drinking
too much.

36:03.338 --> 36:05.206
Well, it's that, yeah.
And I've been drugging you.

36:08.076 --> 36:09.310
But there's more
good news.

36:09.377 --> 36:10.277
You're not a murderer.

36:10.345 --> 36:11.612
What?

36:11.680 --> 36:12.947
What the hell
are you saying?

36:13.014 --> 36:14.348
Ah, but there's more
bad news.

36:14.416 --> 36:15.783
See, since you ripped off
your money man,

36:15.850 --> 36:16.750
he wants you dead.

36:16.818 --> 36:18.185
And that's a big problem

36:18.253 --> 36:19.853
because we told his guys
where they could find you.

36:19.921 --> 36:21.422
They're going to Rio!

36:21.489 --> 36:23.090
Actually, no.

36:23.158 --> 36:24.825
There's one final piece
I got to tell you.

36:24.893 --> 36:26.093
Also bad news.

36:26.161 --> 36:27.261
We're not going to Rio.

36:27.329 --> 36:30.030
What the hell
are you doing?!

36:30.098 --> 36:31.332
Chuck...

36:35.804 --> 36:37.037
This is your stop.

36:40.275 --> 36:42.910
Chuck, what is this?

36:42.978 --> 36:45.980
Look, you can't be serious!
This is mental!

36:46.047 --> 36:47.681
You know,
there's nothing more pathetic

36:47.749 --> 36:48.949
than a bitch
who can't move on.

36:50.986 --> 36:53.587
A raging British jackass
once told me that.

37:05.834 --> 37:07.868
Cash is...Heavy.

37:07.936 --> 37:09.203
Wow!

37:09.271 --> 37:11.105
Oh.

37:11.172 --> 37:13.407
So I should just drop this off
at the bank?

37:13.475 --> 37:14.908
Show them
a police report.

37:14.976 --> 37:17.578
They'll probably chalk it up
to a transfer mistake.

37:17.646 --> 37:18.979
The rest of the cash
we got from Charles

37:19.047 --> 37:20.481
is going back
to his victims.

37:20.548 --> 37:21.749
Buddy of mine on the force
is putting together a list.

37:21.816 --> 37:23.017
What happened to Charles?

37:23.084 --> 37:24.351
Oh, uh, he's currently
on the run

37:24.419 --> 37:26.120
from his <i>former</i>
<i>money manager.</i>

37:26.187 --> 37:28.622
You guys are amazing!

37:28.690 --> 37:30.758
Sorry about having to sacrifice
your boat.

37:32.894 --> 37:34.428
You know, I think...

37:34.496 --> 37:37.698
Josh would have appreciated
the final voyage.

37:44.186 --> 37:46.320
Mom, have you seen Jesse?

37:48.490 --> 37:49.724
Are you going somewhere?

37:49.791 --> 37:52.159
Tampa.

37:52.227 --> 37:54.762
I've been meaning to visit
my friend Gwen.

37:54.830 --> 37:57.665
So that's what
I'm gonna do.

37:57.733 --> 38:00.368
Were you planning
on saying goodbye?

38:02.838 --> 38:05.740
Well, all right.
Tell Gwen I said hi.

38:05.807 --> 38:08.809
I don't even particularly <i>like</i>
<i>Gwen, Michael.</i>

38:10.445 --> 38:13.047
But I can't keep walking past
Jesse in <i>my</i> house

38:13.115 --> 38:14.615
with all this pressure.

38:14.683 --> 38:18.452
And I can't let you
keep telling lie

38:18.520 --> 38:20.254
after lie.

38:20.322 --> 38:23.591
You know, you say that
like you think I enjoy it.

38:23.659 --> 38:27.662
Don't bother calling me to come
back until it's all over.

38:31.933 --> 38:34.101
I'm sorry.
I <i>have</i> to take this.

38:43.178 --> 38:45.813
Mr. Barrett.
At long last.

38:45.881 --> 38:47.515
I got your little message.

38:47.582 --> 38:49.417
You've never heard
of e-mail?

38:49.484 --> 38:51.419
I guess I'm just
old-fashioned.

38:51.486 --> 38:53.821
I don't believe in making a deal
without a handshake.

38:53.889 --> 38:54.989
If you want the bible,

38:55.057 --> 38:56.390
you have to get on
a plane.

38:56.458 --> 38:58.826
I just got off one, son.

38:58.894 --> 39:02.263
Thought I should meet you
face-to-face.

39:02.330 --> 39:05.099
I'll be in touch.

39:14.376 --> 39:17.445
So, Barrett's in town.

39:17.512 --> 39:19.280
The prince of darkness
right here in Miami.

39:19.347 --> 39:20.715
I think we've used
that name before.

39:20.782 --> 39:22.616
Yeah? I'll try and think
of something better.

39:22.684 --> 39:24.351
Meantime,
here's the FAA manifest

39:24.419 --> 39:26.087
for Drake Tech's
private jet.

39:26.154 --> 39:27.188
15 guys on board.

39:27.255 --> 39:28.756
I guess he brought
an army.

39:28.824 --> 39:32.026
Doubt that will stop him
from hiring some locals.

39:32.094 --> 39:33.194
Yeah, I already made
a few calls

39:33.261 --> 39:34.395
for some private
security firms.

39:34.463 --> 39:35.730
Trying to figure out
where he's staying, too.

39:35.797 --> 39:36.864
Well, that's a start.

39:36.932 --> 39:38.232
He had to have visited
Miami before.

39:38.300 --> 39:40.000
We should find out
where his old haunts are.

39:40.068 --> 39:42.269
Yep. Lots of work ahead.
Hey. Jesse coming?

39:42.337 --> 39:43.738
Consuela!

39:43.805 --> 39:45.206
Five beers, please!

39:46.308 --> 39:47.608
What? Got to hydrate.

39:52.314 --> 39:53.981
Michael?

39:54.049 --> 39:55.649
We need to talk.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.887
Hey, Fi.

39:59.955 --> 40:02.123
What's going on, Jesse?

40:02.190 --> 40:05.459
You know,
something was, uh...

40:05.527 --> 40:07.561
Something was
bothering me...

40:07.629 --> 40:08.696
For the last few days.

40:12.334 --> 40:14.368
I was having a hard time
putting my finger on it.

40:16.905 --> 40:18.839
Then I talked to
my old handler Marv.

40:18.907 --> 40:20.808
You remember him.
Right?

40:25.413 --> 40:27.715
There's no security footage
from the military annex

40:27.783 --> 40:29.083
on the day
that I was burned.

40:29.151 --> 40:30.651
It's all been wiped.

40:30.719 --> 40:33.354
But, uh...

40:33.421 --> 40:38.058
There's another facility
across the street.

40:38.126 --> 40:41.362
Marv found that footage
hadn't been erased.

40:41.429 --> 40:44.031
So it turns out that
at the exact same moment

40:44.099 --> 40:46.801
that I was accused
of stealing government files,

40:46.868 --> 40:49.136
someone else was rushing away
from the annex.

40:57.112 --> 40:59.280
Well, that doesn't mean --
No! No!

40:59.347 --> 41:00.581
No!!

41:00.649 --> 41:02.383
You do <i>not</i> get to lie
to me anymore!!

41:04.519 --> 41:07.488
Michael burned me.

41:07.556 --> 41:09.824
And you all helped
cover it up.

41:09.891 --> 41:11.392
It wasn't meant to happen.

41:11.459 --> 41:13.127
We've been trying
to take Barrett out

41:13.195 --> 41:14.895
so you can get back in.

41:14.963 --> 41:16.931
Everything
that's happened

41:16.998 --> 41:18.699
since the day that I met
you people has been a lie.

41:18.767 --> 41:19.867
No, that's not true.

41:19.935 --> 41:21.902
And Michael, he's a spy.

41:21.970 --> 41:23.671
You know, I-I should
expect that from him.

41:23.738 --> 41:25.039
But you...

41:27.142 --> 41:29.243
I thought I meant something
to you.

41:31.613 --> 41:33.247
You <i>do.</i>
<i>You can stop.</i>

41:34.716 --> 41:36.083
You can stop right there.

41:40.455 --> 41:42.523
Goodbye, Fiona.

41:42.591 --> 41:44.525
No, J-Jesse.

41:44.593 --> 41:46.727
Please.

42:06.982 --> 42:08.182
Yeah, Fi.

42:08.250 --> 42:10.484
Jesse found out --
about everything.

42:10.552 --> 42:11.886
He had a gun.

42:11.953 --> 42:13.621
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you okay?

42:13.688 --> 42:16.056
We ruined his life,
Michael.

42:16.124 --> 42:17.524
Where is he?

42:17.592 --> 42:19.159
I don't know.

42:20.727 --> 42:22.231
But I think
he's gonna make us pay.
