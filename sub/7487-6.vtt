Yes, I was there.
Yes, I had a gun.

04:03.244 --> 04:06.511
But I did not pull the trigger.
That was someone else.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.480
Someone who knew that I would be
in that rope line,

04:08.482 --> 04:10.015
Who knew that I'd been mugged
months earlier

04:10.017 --> 04:11.750
And I carried a pistol
for protection,

04:11.752 --> 04:15.587

who could point the finger at me

Your plan to assassinate
the president.

Do you know who verified
the handwriting?

The department
of the treasury.

They're forgers,
every last one of them.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.777

did this?

that elvis did it.

And with your help,
I can prove it.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.957
The bullet.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.725
It's still
in cooper's head.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.460
We asked for it
during the trial

04:55.462 --> 04:57.829
So they could see that it
did not come from my gun.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.598
They wouldn't
give it to me.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.667
It's too dangerous,
they said,

05:01.669 --> 05:02.968
And removing it
from his brain

05:02.970 --> 05:04.836
Could put the president's
life at risk,

05:04.838 --> 05:06.972
So there
it remained.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.041
And here I remained,

Waiting for the day
that he died.

is to get that bullet,

the same pretty lies

About my dead husband --
how he strengthened the military

20:18.751 --> 20:21.919

the baltic peace accords,

Well,

the bullet and didn't die,

You fight for the underdog.

No.
No?

41:58.950 --> 42:00.984
No, not just jake --
both of them.

42:00.986 --> 42:02.886
I intervened
to save both their lives.

42:02.888 --> 42:05.288
You.
You crossed me?

42:05.290 --> 42:07.991
[ chuckles ]

42:07.993 --> 42:09.659
You may be command, dad,

42:09.661 --> 42:11.127
But I have weapons
at my disposal,

42:11.129 --> 42:13.997
Weapons
you can't possibly possess.

42:13.999 --> 42:17.033
¶ uh-huh

42:17.035 --> 42:18.835
¶ oh, yeah

42:20.137 --> 42:22.939
¶ love and happiness

42:22.941 --> 42:24.707
