This is great.
Not only did I live long enough...

...to see Meg go to her first dance,
but I'm taking her, too.

When the most popular girl in school
asks you to the dance, you don't say no.

15:34.643 --> 15:37.229
You say, okay.

15:37.688 --> 15:41.400
I just can't understand why you dumped
your own daughter for Connie Demico.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.110
BRIAN: Lois, it's simple transference.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.779
See, to Peter,
Connie Demico is really Phoebe Diamond.

a big "L" on my forehead while I'm at it?

Now, Meg,

to the other kids you don't belong there.
