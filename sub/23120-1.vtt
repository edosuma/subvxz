01:11.720 --> 01:14.690
She said she's a
prostitute, but I don't do that.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.529
Well, you got to understand
where I'm coming from-

01:16.600 --> 01:18.728
If you could just see
yourself right now.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.326
You look like
you just had a lobotomy.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.845
What's wrong with you?

01:22.920 --> 01:24.570
This is reality.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.165
Reality? My ass.

01:26.240 --> 01:27.890
It's all made-up.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.281
Let me ask you this, huh,

01:30.400 --> 01:33.244
how many times on this show
have you seen the cops

01:33.360 --> 01:37.809
arrest, you know, killers and-and
rapists or something like that?

01:37.880 --> 01:40.486
How many times
did they slap the cuffs

01:40.560 --> 01:41.971
on some crooked CEO fuck?

01:42.080 --> 01:43.286
What can I get you?

01:43.360 --> 01:44.361
Beer.
- Beer.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.521
Bottle? Draft?

01:45.600 --> 01:47.682
Uh, draft.
- Draft.

01:47.760 --> 01:51.128
What you see is them always
catching drug users and johns,

01:51.240 --> 01:53.527
you know, people just hurtin',

01:53.600 --> 01:55.602
just looking for a little
pleasure out of life.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.806
Three dollars.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.241
What have you got
against cops?

01:59.320 --> 02:01.561
Got nothin' against cops.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.211
Jesus.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.886
I'll tell you
what I got something against.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.964
I got something against stupidity.
Good ol' stupidity.

02:10.039 --> 02:11.929
That's what I got something against.
There you go.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.844
Oh, keep it.
- Oh, thanks.

02:14.920 --> 02:16.126
You comin' or goin'?

02:17.240 --> 02:18.765
Passing through, kind of.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.890
I swear to God, a fly can go in your
mouth and you wouldn't even know it.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.450
You'd just swallow it,
'cause it's, like,

02:26.520 --> 02:28.124
the only protein
you've ever had.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.128
It's good beer.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.491
Huh?
- Good beer.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.250
Yeah. Mm.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.970
From Pennsylvania.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.247
So, how long
have you had this place?

02:37.320 --> 02:38.890
Too long.

02:41.360 --> 02:42.168
It's real homey.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.761
You think so?

02:46.840 --> 02:48.763
Where the hell do you live?

02:48.840 --> 02:51.081
New Hampshire.
- Portsmouth.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.764
Home of the Navy prison.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.649
Yeah, I know the place.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.603
You don't remember me, do you?

03:14.200 --> 03:15.645
Wait a minute.

03:16.520 --> 03:17.681
It can't be.

03:19.120 --> 03:20.724
Could be.
- No way.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.889
Way.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.004
Sweet Jesus.
- Doc?

03:27.080 --> 03:29.287
Wow, "Doc."
Nobody's called me that

03:29.360 --> 03:31.249
in a long, long time.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.449
Fuck me.
Doc, you made it.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.646
Yeah, yeah.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.485
Wow!
Hey, O'Toole, looky here.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.329
He's an old 'Nam buddy of mine.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.004
I saved his life once.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.491
He never saved my life.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.686
Didn't think so.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.531
You got to excuse me, Doc.
Boy, I'm shit for names.

03:48.600 --> 03:49.965
Sheppard.
Larry Sheppard.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.411
Shep.
That's right.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.249
19-year-old kid.
Navy corpsman.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.646
Huh?
- Once.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.484
Yeah, well,
we were all something once.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.131
Now we're just something else.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.646
So you do remember me?
Of course I remember you.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.762
You heard?
I got busted down to E-1.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.484
Yeah. Yeah.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.086
Most unfair. Boy.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.811
The green weenie,
they broke it off in you.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.921
How long was it?
Was it, like, what, three years?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.685
Ended up about two
with good behavior.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.730
Oh. Well, see,
that's not so bad.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.723
Well, it was pretty bad.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.928
Mm.
It was a long time ago.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.844
Yeah.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.126
BCD?

04:31.240 --> 04:32.526
Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.410
But at some point, instead of
calling it a Bad Conduct Discharge,

04:35.480 --> 04:37.369
I started calling it
a better career decision.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.602
Fuckin' A.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.721
So, how'd you, uh,
find my lonesome ass?

04:44.800 --> 04:46.450
Oh, it was easy.
The Internet.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.847
You can find anybody
on the Internet these days.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.446
Boy, that is really fucked.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.406
So, Portsmouth, huh?

04:54.520 --> 04:57.091
Mm-hmm.
What do you do for a living there?

04:57.160 --> 04:59.640
I'm a stocking clerk
at the Navy Exchange.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.768
You got to be shitting me.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.206
That's all right,
that's all right.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.122
Don't you go someplace
when you close?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.331
Like where?

05:24.400 --> 05:26.482
I don't know.
- Home?

05:28.720 --> 05:31.485
It'll be there tomorrow.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.210
Hmm.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.964
Reveille!
Reveille!

06:25.040 --> 06:26.883
Drop your cocks
and grab your socks!

06:27.000 --> 06:28.809
Reveille!

06:30.600 --> 06:33.649
Hey. This is
the last slice of pizza.

06:33.720 --> 06:34.721
You want it?
- No.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.842
That's it.
Once this is gone,

06:36.920 --> 06:38.251
there's no more pizza.
- No. Ow.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.762
You sure?
Going once, going twice, gone.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.808
Mmm.
I love cold pizza.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.651
Hey, you want a beer?

06:48.760 --> 06:50.046
Mm-mm.
- You sure?

06:50.120 --> 06:51.565
Hair of the dog.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.364
Always works for me.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.562
Oh, fuck.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.802
I'm still a little fucked up
from last night,

06:59.880 --> 07:02.121
if you want to know the truth.

07:03.880 --> 07:07.123
I think I'm getting a little too
old for this shit, frankly.

07:09.280 --> 07:12.568
What's the deal with the grill part
of "Sal's Bar & Grill"?

07:12.640 --> 07:15.405
Well, gone to rust is the deal.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.528
That's too bad.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.968
I guess people just lost their
taste for an honest burger.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.201
Why?
Are you hungry?

07:22.280 --> 07:23.327
No, just curious.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.209
Hey, you know what,

07:25.280 --> 07:27.044
we got Mexicans here now,

07:27.120 --> 07:29.930
so we can get
some chorizo con huevos.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.447
Hey, we qualify for menudo,
if you got the balls for that.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.931
No, thanks.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.889
You don't want a bite?

07:36.960 --> 07:40.089
There's something I want to show
you, though, if you're up for it.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.731
Mm-hmm.
Sure. I'm always up for it.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.723
You got a car?

07:44.800 --> 07:48.122
Of course I got a car.
I'm a fuckin' businessman.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.966
You want to go now?

07:55.080 --> 07:57.970
Yeah, whenever.
Fuck it.

08:19.360 --> 08:22.728
Oh, I just fuckin' love it,
you know?

08:22.800 --> 08:24.370
It's priceless.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.362
What is?
- The Navy.

08:28.240 --> 08:32.086
They put the cock to you and then they
let you work at the Navy Exchange.

08:32.159 --> 08:35.083
I got five people
working under me.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.202
You're a fuckin' inspiration.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.760
You know what amazes me
about you?

08:39.840 --> 08:41.763
Could be anything.
I'm a pretty amazing guy.

08:41.840 --> 08:47.483
You turn the keys to your bar over to
the guy who's asleep on your pool table

08:47.560 --> 08:50.040
and then you jump in your car and
you drive me to hell and gone

08:50.120 --> 08:52.521
and you don't even know
where we're going.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.126
Well, I didn't think
it would take so fuckin' long.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.242
Take this left up here-

08:58.320 --> 08:59.367
Right here? Mm-hmm.

08:59.480 --> 09:00.811
That's going into a church.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.405
Yep.
Oh, no.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.648
What-what are you doing here?

09:04.720 --> 09:06.802
No, no, no, no-
You're gonna love this, I promise.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.441
I don't know, Doc.
Look, I mean, you seen one, you seen 'en? All, right'?

09:10.520 --> 09:13.126
No, this is gonna be good.

09:13.200 --> 09:16.522
Geez.
What'd you get me into here, huh?

09:16.600 --> 09:18.807
See, as Christians,
brothers and sisters,

09:18.880 --> 09:22.646
we have choices, hmm?

09:22.720 --> 09:27.009
We can choose
to lay down our will

09:27.080 --> 09:29.731
and follow God's will.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.086
That's right.
That's right, Pastor.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.925
The question is,
are you willing to do that?

09:34.000 --> 09:38.085
Oh, my fucking God.
- Not are you ready, but are you willing?

09:38.200 --> 09:40.328
You see, 'cause if you're willing,

09:40.400 --> 09:42.562
if you're willing,
you can trust and believe...

09:42.640 --> 09:44.404
That's him.
I told you you'd like this.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.126
Oh, my God.
- ...that God will take care of the rest.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.929
Yes, Lord.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.526
Yes, He will See, it's a powerful thing...

09:51.600 --> 09:52.931
What's he doing?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.571
...when you surrender
to God's will...

09:55.640 --> 09:57.449
Excuse me, could you
move over for a minute?

09:57.520 --> 09:59.522
...And if fakes ahold of you,

09:59.600 --> 10:01.887
- a powerful thing...
- Powerful!

10:01.960 --> 10:05.248
When you begin
to take that moment

10:05.320 --> 10:06.845
to look deep inside yourself

10:06.920 --> 10:09.207
and ask the question,

10:09.280 --> 10:11.681
am I willing

10:11.760 --> 10:13.683
to surrender to God's will?

10:13.760 --> 10:15.364
Yes, yes, yes.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.727
Well, you know what they
call that, when God answers?

10:17.800 --> 10:20.201
See, when God answers,
what they call that is

10:20.280 --> 10:22.851
you're having a God moment.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.931
You see, when we stop to ask,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.401
are my choices,

10:32.480 --> 10:35.211
are they Christ-like choices?

10:35.320 --> 10:37.721
I mean, this dude

10:37.800 --> 10:40.963
was a first-class drinker,
gambler, cocksman?

10:41.040 --> 10:42.769
Shh.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.604
Sorry.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.763
Most likely a speed freak, too. I mean,
how did you even find the place?

10:47.840 --> 10:50.081
The Internet.
- The Internet.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.731
Son of a bitch.
...and all of the relationships

10:52.800 --> 10:55.087
where people are counting

10:55.160 --> 10:57.401
on your Christ-like
character...

10:57.480 --> 10:59.289
Yes, sir.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.966
...are trusting
that you will demonstrate

11:02.040 --> 11:04.247
Christ-like integrity.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.004
- Yes.
- Oh, yes!

11:06.120 --> 11:08.248
Amen to that!

11:08.320 --> 11:10.926
Come on. Don't do that.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.286
I see we have, uh,

11:15.400 --> 11:17.368
some visitors
amongst us here today.

11:17.480 --> 11:20.609
Welcome!
Welcome, brothers, to our Sunday services.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.401
Would you care to stand and
perhaps introduce yourselves?

11:24.480 --> 11:27.563
All right.
- Uh, name is Sal.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.165
Salvatore Nealon.

11:30.680 --> 11:34.162
Uh, USMC, Sergeant, uh, retired.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.766
Uh...
Oh, hey, hey!

11:36.880 --> 11:38.609
Come on. No, come on.
Get up.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.728
Guess who this lad is.
- Huh?

11:40.840 --> 11:42.763
It's Doc.

11:42.840 --> 11:45.161
Huh? Doc.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.765
Also known as Larry Sheppard.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.446
We were in the service together
with your pastor.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.483
Bless my soul.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.881
Praise God!
Welcome, brothers, welcome.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.446
Thank you for joining us
in our fellowship this morning.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.125
Mmm-

12:02.240 --> 12:03.810
Oh.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.564
Oh, man, oh, man.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.808
Southern ham.
- Thank you, ma'am.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.484
All right, so listen up, Ruth,

12:11.560 --> 12:14.848
I'm hoping that this old
man appreciates you.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.530
Oh, I think he does.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.250
'Cause if he ever don't,

12:18.360 --> 12:21.170
you pack your bag
and you come live with Sal.

12:22.640 --> 12:23.926
You don't have a wife?

12:24.040 --> 12:25.610
No, ma'am.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.051
Neither chick nor child.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.162
I do have a lady friend, though.

12:31.240 --> 12:33.163
But she don't cook worth a damn.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.884
She does have other talents,

12:35.960 --> 12:37.610
if you know what I mean.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.530
Um, well, what about you,
Mr. Sheppard?

12:40.600 --> 12:42.568
Are you single or married?

12:42.640 --> 12:45.883
Oh, I married a wonderful woman,
Mrs. Mueller.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.281
Light of my life, my Mary.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.880
Heart as big as anything.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.281
Real pretty girl.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.691
Great big smile.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.250
Mm. Nice.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.528
She, um...

12:59.600 --> 13:00.931
she had a little slowness

13:01.000 --> 13:03.048
because of a thing
when she was born.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.805
Wait, what's that mean?
She's retarded?

13:06.960 --> 13:08.007
No. No.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.090
She could do anything
that anybody else could.

13:11.160 --> 13:14.050
She just was a little delayed.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.202
Huh.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.884
- Great mom, great wife.
- Mm.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.291
Well, what does she do?

13:19.400 --> 13:21.528
Oh, I'm sorry.
She...

13:21.600 --> 13:25.241
Um...
I lost Mary in January

13:25.320 --> 13:26.606
from, uh, breast cancer.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.725
I'm so sorry.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.122
I'm sorry, Doc.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.202
You know me,
I-I don't mean nothin'.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.126
We pay for what
we say, Salvatore.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.568
Yeah?
Well, put it on my tab.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.085
It's okay.
You didn't know.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.970
Your tab's long overdue,
I suspect.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.161
Um, do you, uh,
have any children, Doc?

13:53.280 --> 13:56.011
Um, yes.
Just one, a son.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.650
- Larry Jr.
- Oh.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.690
Well, uh, Richard and I,
we have a girl and a boy.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.131
And we have four grandchildren.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.440
Praise God.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.887
Wait, is it... Richard?

14:05.960 --> 14:08.531
Honey, do we have some coffee
or pie or something

14:08.600 --> 14:11.001
for our guests before we
send them on their way?

14:11.160 --> 14:12.491
Richard.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.005
Oh, yes. Um...

14:14.160 --> 14:15.924
I have a peach cobbler
for dessert.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.691
Ooh!
Peach cobbler!

14:18.800 --> 14:21.610
Now we're livin'!

14:21.680 --> 14:24.286
Huh? Ooh!

14:24.360 --> 14:25.646
All right.

14:25.720 --> 14:28.007
You married up, Richard.

14:28.080 --> 14:31.323
I'm glad to see you prevailing
over your hardships, Doc.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.607
Oh, I-I do my best.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.287
You, at least, seem to have
turned out to be a decent man.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.647
Well, try to be.

14:39.720 --> 14:40.881
And so do I.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.843
Me, too.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.121
I, uh...

14:47.200 --> 14:51.649
I regret any role I played
in all that... foolishness

14:51.720 --> 14:53.370
that happened back in Vietnam.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.682
Oh.
It's okay.

14:58.240 --> 15:01.642
What the hell happened
to Mueller the Mauler?

15:01.720 --> 15:03.324
Huh? I mean...

15:03.400 --> 15:05.448
Well, shit.

15:05.520 --> 15:08.364
What, did you put him in
the Witness Protection Program?

15:08.440 --> 15:11.842
You got him hiding
under the couch or something?

15:11.920 --> 15:13.490
Jesus.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.483
I grew up, Sal.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.683
I found my life's purpose
on the way.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.888
Good for you.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.930
So, what about you?

15:24.880 --> 15:27.167
I always figured you for
a lifer in the Marine Corps.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.208
Is that the way
things shook out?

15:30.880 --> 15:32.609
Yeah.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.126
Yeah, I re-upped.
- Sure.

15:35.240 --> 15:38.403
Expectin ' all the dominoes to fall,
just like they said they would.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.245
I was ready to kill me
some commies in San Diego,

15:41.320 --> 15:43.049
but they never showed up.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.202
Hey, can you believe this?

15:45.280 --> 15:48.966
People go to Vietnam
on fuckin' vacation.

15:49.080 --> 15:52.402
Hmm.
- Huh? They pay good money to have their picture taken

15:52.480 --> 15:56.007
where 52,000 young Americans
took their last dump.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.491
Fuck me.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.001
So, you, uh, mustered out
on principle?

16:00.080 --> 16:03.448
I mustered out with a plate in
my head on 100% disability.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.726
And that's the good news.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.485
Boy, I wonder how that happened.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.763
Oh.
Now, that's a good story.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.320
Fuck all if I can remember it.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.569
I believe drink was involved.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.404
Yes, yes.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.562
I'm sure of it'.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.563
Speakin' of drink,

16:23.640 --> 16:25.961
this is the best water
I've ever had.

16:29.680 --> 16:33.162
You see, Ruth, I was on the
shy side of insubordination

16:33.280 --> 16:36.170
most of the time,
but I could get away with it

16:36.280 --> 16:39.204
on account of my dashing
good looks and boyish charm.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.363
I guess we should all be just grateful

16:42.520 --> 16:44.045
that we're still alive.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.281
Amen-
Praise God.

16:45.360 --> 16:46.566
I tell myself that.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.089
Doc, you're not gonna eat that?

16:51.160 --> 16:54.403
Mmm, mmm, mmm. Ooh, God.
I don't want it to go to waste.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.729
You, uh, okay, Doc?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.249
Mm-hmm.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.527
Whatever if is
that's troubling you,

17:05.599 --> 17:08.205
it's probably best to talk about if-

17:10.560 --> 17:12.847
My son...

17:14.400 --> 17:16.971
Because of my son,
I c-came here,

17:17.040 --> 17:19.122
found you guys.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.446
Maybe I shouldn't have.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.289
Your son?

17:23.359 --> 17:24.805
Larry Jr.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.324
A year ago, he joined the corps.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.044
Oorah.

17:31.120 --> 17:35.011
And then two days ago, they came
and told me that he'd been killed.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.200
It was in, uh, Baghdad.

17:39.280 --> 17:43.080
His convoy got ambushed.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.811
They told me that he unloaded
his weapon on them

17:45.880 --> 17:47.928
and he died with his
bayonet in his hand.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.327
Jesus.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.880
He's coming home tonight.

17:53.960 --> 17:59.444
He's gonna be buried
in Arlington.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.205
Full honors.
- A hero.

18:03.240 --> 18:06.164
And I was wondering
if you guys could come with me.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.122
We ask, heavenly Father,
that you continue

18:30.240 --> 18:33.130
to strengthen his spirit
and to soften the sadness

18:33.240 --> 18:35.368
during this-this time
of bereavement-

18:37.120 --> 18:39.885
I can promise you, Doc,
you will meet your wife

18:39.960 --> 18:42.281
and son again,
in a better place.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.930
Oh, come on.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.729
And all of this will seem

18:45.800 --> 18:48.485
like a momentary separation.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.287
Oh, come on.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.448
What better place
are they going to, huh?

18:54.520 --> 18:56.568
Las Vegas?
Miami Beach?

18:56.640 --> 18:59.723
Uh, Doc knows the place
of which I speak, Sal.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.565
Well, then show him.
He's got a map.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.803
Or maybe he can look it up
on the World Wide Internet, huh?

19:05.920 --> 19:09.527
Well, one only knows it
when one sees it.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.080
And as far
as you are concerned, Sergeant,

19:12.160 --> 19:14.561
it's odds-on that you
shall never, ever see it.

19:14.640 --> 19:18.281
Well, then I guess I'll never miss it.
Oh, you will miss it.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.771
You will miss it dearly,

19:19.840 --> 19:22.844
each and every sweet
moment of eternity.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.088
Do you even know
how long eternity is?

19:26.160 --> 19:28.162
Yeah.

19:28.240 --> 19:29.401
It ain't gonna matter.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.443
Let me ask you something,

19:31.520 --> 19:34.000
with all the billions of people

19:34.120 --> 19:36.122
floatin' around in your heaven,

19:36.240 --> 19:38.686
how come none of them
ever got the word back

19:38.800 --> 19:39.961
to the rest of us?

19:40.040 --> 19:42.281
One of them did.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.171
Oh, right.
That guy. Yeah.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.601
A bit sketchy on the details,
if you ask me.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.330
I'm not asking you.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.210
Okay, Doc, listen up.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.847
I'm really sorry for your loss,

19:59.920 --> 20:02.810
but I ain't gonna blow
a bunch of smoke up your ass.

20:04.680 --> 20:05.966
The worst thing

20:06.040 --> 20:08.168
that can happen to anybody

20:08.200 --> 20:10.043
has landed on you,

20:10.160 --> 20:13.050
and now you just got
to deal with it.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.366
Lord have mercy.

20:14.520 --> 20:15.965
What?

20:16.040 --> 20:18.327
You were a hazard
when you were a younger man.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.528
Now you're just an old fool.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.568
What the hell are you talking...
You know, I...

20:22.640 --> 20:25.041
I got your hazard
dangling here, huh?

20:25.160 --> 20:27.731
I'm going to ask you to watch
your language in my house, sir.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.326
What language is that?
I'm not... Man, listen...

20:30.400 --> 20:33.244
Guys, I didn't want
to cause any trouble.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.530
Okay.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.005
Doc,

20:41.080 --> 20:43.208
I'm gonna help you
bury your boy.

20:43.240 --> 20:46.449
Now, I may not be able
to get you up into heaven,

20:46.520 --> 20:48.966
but I can sure as hell
get you to Arlington.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.922
Mueller?

20:55.000 --> 20:58.004
I certainly would like
to help you, Doc, but I...

20:58.080 --> 21:01.050
But he has to stay here
and pray for you,

21:01.120 --> 21:02.724
which will be very helpful.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.928
- Richard.
- Yes.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.048
Could I see you for a moment?

21:07.160 --> 21:08.286
Of course, dear.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.562
Mueller, please.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.530
I don't get around so well
anymore, as you can see, Doc.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.125
We'll just be in the car.

21:16.120 --> 21:19.329
I know, but...
I don't think so.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.289
No, no, it's impossible.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.282
He is comin' with.
That's affirmative.

21:29.360 --> 21:31.089
No, he said he wasn't going to.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.730
No, don't matter what he said.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.043
I guarantee you
his old lady is shaming him.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.044
Okay?
She's in there right now saying,

21:39.120 --> 21:40.724
"Richard, you have to..."

21:40.800 --> 21:43.326
...go with that poor man.
He needs you.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.920
He will have qualified people
to counsel him at Arlington.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.322
Well, yes, but who will protect
him from that Sal person?

21:49.440 --> 21:52.284
Oh, Lord, that's right.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.322
Shit always goes sideways

21:54.400 --> 21:55.731
when Sal's involved.
- Richard.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.371
What in the world has happened
to your vocabulary?

21:58.440 --> 21:59.965
Oh, I'm sorry, babe.
I'm sorry.

22:00.040 --> 22:02.407
Just kind of slipped out.
I'm sorry.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.084
Mm-hmm.

22:04.160 --> 22:07.482
Look, you can't refuse friends
in the time of need.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.170
Friends?
- Mm-hm.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.328
I haven't seen these men
in decades.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.841
You can't refuse anybody.
You're a preacher.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.930
They represent a
dark period in my life, Ruth.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.445
A very dark period.

22:18.520 --> 22:22.047
And you represent God.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.322
The man lost his son, Richard.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.688
That's all I need to say.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.562
Hey, I'd turn the radio on,
but it's broke.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.248
You got, uh...
A boom box or something?

22:50.440 --> 22:51.646
Want to play...
- No?

22:53.680 --> 22:55.648
Hey, Doc, you can move
your chair back.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.564
You know, separate...
They're individual controls.

22:58.680 --> 23:00.569
Just un-underneath, in the front, there.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.286
Give you some legroom.
Yeah, that's better, right?

23:05.680 --> 23:08.650
So, Richard...

23:08.720 --> 23:11.485
what's the story
with the collar, now, huh?

23:11.560 --> 23:13.961
You got to wear that?
Is it, like, a tracking system

23:14.040 --> 23:16.361
so God knows where you
are at all times?

23:16.440 --> 23:19.808
Do you always have to wear
that thing or can you relax?

23:19.880 --> 23:22.201
I am relaxed.
- Really? All right.

23:22.280 --> 23:24.362
Don't seem that way, but...

23:24.440 --> 23:25.851
if you say so.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.843
I never knew
your name was Richard

23:27.920 --> 23:30.400
in the years
we were together, never.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.522
I mean, if was always Mueller.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.887
Richard. Wow.

23:34.960 --> 23:38.760
When you was a kid,
did you go by "Richie" or "Rich"?

23:38.880 --> 23:39.961
Dick?

23:40.040 --> 23:42.361
You like Dick?
- Hmm?

23:43.600 --> 23:45.887
I just never knew any brothers
named Richard, you know?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.207
I didn't know
they named 'em that.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.163
Richard Pryor.

23:50.280 --> 23:51.850
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:51.920 --> 23:52.967
Richard Wright.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.565
Uh...

23:54.640 --> 23:55.846
Mm... Richie Havens.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.160
Oh, oh.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.208
Dick Gregory.
Oh, I stand corrected.

23:59.280 --> 24:00.770
Little Richard.

24:00.880 --> 24:04.282
Now, he likes dick.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.131
Big... big dick... Yeah.

24:07.240 --> 24:08.685
What the fuck?
Look at this guy.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.086
He's on my ass.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.044
Just up on my ass.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.042
Look at this.
- Change lanes.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.327
I'm not gonna change lanes.
This is my lane.

24:16.400 --> 24:19.643
Get the fuck off my ass. Get out of the way.
Just move over.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.563
Come on.
Just get out of the way.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.449
Lei' him by you-

24:23.480 --> 24:25.687
Okay, fuckhead, you want to play?
- Let's play.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.764
What are you doing, Sal? Want to play?
- All right, just hold on, okay?

24:28.840 --> 24:30.604
Trying to have an accident out here?
- Just hold on.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.444
No, I'm gonna jackknife
this motherfucker.

24:32.480 --> 24:33.720
- Fuckhead.
- What is wrong with you?

24:33.800 --> 24:35.723
You want to play?
- Hey, move over

24:35.800 --> 24:36.562
and let the guy get by!
All right. Shit.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.243
Hey! You trying
to get me killed out here?

24:40.320 --> 24:43.051
Hey, fuck you, asshole!

24:43.120 --> 24:44.963
- Fuck you!
- Hey!

24:45.040 --> 24:46.246
I'm talking to you, jackoff!

24:46.320 --> 24:47.606
You fuckin' asshole!

24:47.680 --> 24:49.011
You fuckin'
get me hurt out here,

24:49.120 --> 24:52.329
I will bury your fuckin' ass
on the side of the road.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.562
All right.
You hear me? You understand?

24:54.640 --> 24:57.086
Keep your eye on the road, man!
- Yes!

24:57.160 --> 24:58.924
Mueller has arrived!

24:59.000 --> 25:01.765
Fuck around, I got a wife and a
congregation to get back to.

25:01.840 --> 25:02.841
Fuckin ' drive, man.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.962
I'm driving, I'm driving.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.242
I thought you was lost forever.

25:08.360 --> 25:09.885
I really did.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.442
Where are we
supposed to go, Doc?

25:35.040 --> 25:36.963
Dover Air Force Base.

25:38.480 --> 25:41.131
That...
that's in fuckin' Delaware.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.202
Right. Dover, Delaware.

25:46.400 --> 25:49.290
So... what are we doing here?

25:49.400 --> 25:52.324
I don't know.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.646
You said Arlington.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.724
Well, yeah, that's what they said.
That's what they told me.

25:57.840 --> 26:00.320
But now you...
now you're saying Dover.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.880
Well, I guess...

26:03.000 --> 26:05.685
they have to fly in someplace
first, so they fly into Dover.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.205
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.850
Okay. No, no.
It's all right.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.371
It's okay.

26:10.440 --> 26:11.726
Dover it is.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.730
Do you want me to drive?

26:18.440 --> 26:21.364
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.361
Wonder if something's wrong.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.363
Nah.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.647
He's just the guard at a gate.
He don't know nothing.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.127
I wonder if there'll be
an honor guard and all that.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.810
Well, they'll do something.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.604
You know, be respectful,
you know.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.047
But, uh...
just not in public.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.043
'Cause they...
they got a blackout

27:08.120 --> 27:09.963
on all that stuff
this time around.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.371
Yeah, no pictures of coffins.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.891
No reminders to the public.

27:12.960 --> 27:16.009
H's all bullshit'.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.970
The body's in transit-
The plane is due at 0800 tomorrow-

27:22.040 --> 27:25.010
Come back then, you can wait in the hangar.
- Okay, thank you.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.885
Transit.
Everybody's always in transit,

27:27.960 --> 27:29.246
even when you're dead.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.243
Come on, Sal.
It's okay.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.049
Sorry.

27:39.280 --> 27:40.611
How much is it, ma'am?

27:40.720 --> 27:42.609
It's 35, even.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.483
Whoa, Doc.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.130
What's with the wad?

27:48.200 --> 27:49.929
Uh, they took up a collection

27:50.000 --> 27:51.809
at the exchange when they heard.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.971
See?
You got lots of friends.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.963
Well, they felt bad.

27:58.040 --> 28:00.008
They just wanted
to do something.

28:00.080 --> 28:01.969
And here's your key.
- Thank you.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.520
Man, you guys
ain't watching this?

28:04.640 --> 28:06.529
- Watching what?
- Man, they got him!

28:06.640 --> 28:07.641
Who?

28:07.720 --> 28:10.041
Man, that son of a bitch Saddam.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.128
They got him in a spider hole.

28:12.200 --> 28:15.044
Iraqis in Baghdad celebrated,

28:15.160 --> 28:16.366
some with guns...

28:16.480 --> 28:18.005
some with cheers.

28:19.120 --> 28:21.407
The capture of Saddam Hussein

28:21.480 --> 28:22.970
is e defining moment
in the new Iraq-

28:23.040 --> 28:26.169
I expect that the detention
of Saddam Hussein

28:26.240 --> 28:27.844
will be regarded as the
beginning of reconciliation... -

28:27.920 --> 28:29.729
Fuck.

28:29.840 --> 28:32.571
Can't blow smoke rings
for shit now.

28:32.680 --> 28:35.650
Used to be real good at it.

28:35.720 --> 28:39.122
Something happened
with my tongue or something.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.884
We now have final resolution-

28:42.080 --> 28:44.765
Mm. Doc's out.

28:44.840 --> 28:46.888
Look at this fuckin' guy.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.809
Fuck me.

28:48.880 --> 28:51.611
One day he's the head
of a country,

28:51.680 --> 28:55.844
next day he's just some fuck
hiding out in a spider hole,

28:57.600 --> 28:58.886
scared to death.

29:20.600 --> 29:24.400
He... he-he told me
not to worry.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.285
Come here.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.570
He didn't die in vain.

29:48.960 --> 29:50.291
Mr. Sheppard.

29:50.360 --> 29:52.169
Yes.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.124
Mr. Sheppard, I am Colonel Wilits.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.362
Mm.
The President of the United States

29:57.480 --> 29:59.289
has asked me to express
his deep regrets

29:59.440 --> 30:01.807
that your son
was killed in action.

30:01.920 --> 30:03.410
Thank you.

30:03.480 --> 30:05.926
He died a hero
in the service of his country.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.402
He was an inspiration
to his fellow marines.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.089
Can I see him?

30:14.160 --> 30:16.481
Sir, that would be
ill-advised.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.729
Trust me on this, you do not
want to see him like that.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.609
Is it against the rules?

30:21.680 --> 30:22.920
No.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.970
But the lance corporal was hit
in the back of the head.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.247
I assure you he felt no pain.

30:28.320 --> 30:32.086
But the exit wound in such
a case is devastating...

30:33.000 --> 30:34.126
to the face.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.966
They were behind him?
They shot him from behind?

30:42.040 --> 30:44.805
Take the colonel's advice, Doc.

30:44.840 --> 30:47.730
It's best to remember him
as he was.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.285
I'd have to see him.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.362
But that's just me.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.130
The thing is...

31:01.200 --> 31:04.090
you don't have to listen
to no colonels no more.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.646
Those days are gone.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.646
I'd like to...

31:15.240 --> 31:17.163
I'd like to see my son.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.727
Sir, what you will see...

31:20.840 --> 31:23.047
you will not be able to unsee.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.488
I understand-
I just... I feel like I have to-

31:26.560 --> 31:28.164
As you wish, sir.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.127
Lance Corporal Washington,

31:30.240 --> 31:32.481
please escort these two
gentlemen to the coffee mess.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.324
Yes, sir.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.682
Mr. Sheppard,
come with me.

31:51.840 --> 31:52.887
Hey, kid.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.526
Stand at ease, will you?
You're giving me a fuckin' stiff neck.

31:58.680 --> 32:01.365
Man, I never heard anyone
talk to the colonel like that.

32:01.480 --> 32:02.891
Colonels don't scare me.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.247
Never have, never will.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.890
You a marine?

32:10.120 --> 32:11.326
Yeah, I thought so.

32:12.600 --> 32:16.685
I got more time in the chow
line than you got in the corps.

32:16.760 --> 32:17.921
You, too?

32:18.080 --> 32:20.765
Oorah.

32:20.880 --> 32:23.645
Semper fi, do or die.
How you think I got this cane?

32:27.120 --> 32:28.246
Hey, kid.

32:28.320 --> 32:30.288
The fuck's with your ear?

32:30.400 --> 32:32.209
Baghdad boil.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.725
Say what?

32:33.800 --> 32:35.370
Baghdad boil.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.727
Yeah, everybody's got one.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.723
You get bit by a teeny sand fly

32:39.800 --> 32:41.211
over there, and...

32:42.280 --> 32:43.361
Fuckin' Franken-ear.

32:43.480 --> 32:44.766
Jesus.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.490
They say it'll go away...

32:46.600 --> 32:48.489
in a year or two.
- Oh, yeah.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.967
You can count on that.

32:51.080 --> 32:53.526
One fuckin' ugly ear.

33:04.360 --> 33:07.409
This is a big mistake.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.562
Big mistake.
Hey, hey, hold on.

33:09.640 --> 33:12.246
It's not like there's something
you can do about it now.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.243
Unless you're gonna go over there
and just out-tough the colonel.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.243
I don't want nothing.
- All right?

33:16.320 --> 33:18.971
I'm just along for the ride.
Oh, yeah, right.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.929
Fuck.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.401
So you two were in 'Nam
with Larry's dad?

33:23.520 --> 33:24.965
We were.

33:25.040 --> 33:26.963
You guys know what the fuck
happened back then?

33:27.040 --> 33:29.088
Nah. We were just...

33:29.160 --> 33:32.130
pulling triggers, killing gooks.

33:32.200 --> 33:35.841
Larry said his dad wound up
doing brig time behind it.

33:35.920 --> 33:38.366
Yeah, that's all
in the past now.

33:38.480 --> 33:40.608
What do you know about that?

33:40.680 --> 33:42.682
Sounded like he fucked
some dudes up.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.849
Or some dudes fucked him up.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.764
Are you them dudes?

33:47.840 --> 33:51.367
What exactly did
he tell you?

33:51.480 --> 33:54.882
Only that
some bad shit went down-

33:54.960 --> 33:56.644
I was Larry's
best friend, all right?

33:56.760 --> 33:59.764
So no one else knew
anything about it.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.882
So you were with him
during the ambush?

34:02.960 --> 34:04.325
Ambush?

34:04.400 --> 34:06.687
The ambush. The ambush
and the firefight, they said.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.524
Okay-okay?

34:12.600 --> 34:14.568
Okay?
What the fuck is that, okay?

34:14.679 --> 34:17.001
If that's what they're saying it
was, then that's what it was.

34:17.040 --> 34:20.010
Hey.
Come on, you're his friend.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.560
You were there, right?
What happened?

34:22.679 --> 34:24.569
Come on, kid,
don't stonewall us.

34:24.679 --> 34:27.047
He ain't looking at ya.

34:27.120 --> 34:29.327
Come on, it's just us,
marine to marine.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.880
Jarhead to jarhead.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.167
It was fucked.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.168
Me and Sheppard
and three other guys

34:36.239 --> 34:37.844
were all day humping
school supplies

34:37.920 --> 34:40.924
We had tablets,
pencils, new books.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.400
It' was our last' run-

34:43.520 --> 34:46.251
Anyway, we was always stopping
at this little store

34:46.360 --> 34:48.043
we called Abdul's Haji Mart.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.922
We'd have Haji Cokes.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.728
It was my turn to make the run,

34:51.800 --> 34:53.802
but Sheppard said
he'd do it, so he goes

34:53.880 --> 34:57.043
and we're bullshitting
and this raghead comes up,

34:57.120 --> 34:58.724
shouts out...

35:00.040 --> 35:02.441
"Allah Akbar"...

35:02.560 --> 35:04.244
Whatever the fuck.

35:04.320 --> 35:06.448
"God is great."

35:06.560 --> 35:08.528
Puts a cap in Shep's head.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.969
Jesus.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.923
What happened next?

35:17.960 --> 35:20.247
Shit, man, we went off.

35:20.320 --> 35:22.721
Lit 'em all up.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.450
The raghead, Abdul,

35:24.600 --> 35:26.204
damn near whole fuckin' hood.

35:28.840 --> 35:31.446
Carried Larry back
to the Hummer and went home.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.445
You know, the kid's supposed

35:35.520 --> 35:37.443
to get the Bronze Star
behind this.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.090
Yeah.

35:39.160 --> 35:40.605
He'll get the star.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.444
The more stars
the better, right?

35:42.520 --> 35:44.568
Yeah.
- Right.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.121
Okay...

36:03.200 --> 36:05.282
We can '2' tell him about this.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.771
We can't?
- No.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.763
Let him have his Bronze Star.
- Shit.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.844
Let him have his burial at
Arlington with full honors.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.729
Let him have his hero.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.929
Lord knows the man ain't had nothing
but pain in his life lately.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.923
In other words,
let him have the lie.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.368
Think about it, Sal.
What's more important?

36:22.480 --> 36:23.845
I don't know.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.883
But it's never the lie.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.766
Sal...

36:36.880 --> 36:38.041
Sal.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.881
I'm sorry, sir, but there's
always a sound reason

36:43.000 --> 36:45.002
for my recommendations.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.601
Sal, he doesn't have
a face anymore.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.128
You got to be a man now.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.010
Hey, mister.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.525
Hey, Sal.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.921
How did this boy wind up dead?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.365
I beg your pardon?

37:24.440 --> 37:26.841
I think it's
a pretty simple question.

37:26.920 --> 37:28.206
What happened?

37:28.280 --> 37:30.601
The lance corporal
acquitted himself

37:30.720 --> 37:33.041
with dignity and honor,
and he died a hero.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.849
Yeah, but I mean, they're...

37:34.920 --> 37:36.445
they're all heroes, ain't they?

37:36.560 --> 37:39.211
That they are, sir.
Yeah. All heroes.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.362
No question.

37:41.440 --> 37:44.046
How did it happen that this boy

37:44.120 --> 37:47.124
was shot in the back
of the head like a fucking dog?

37:49.440 --> 37:51.090
He was a brave marine,

37:51.160 --> 37:53.242
credit to the corps,

37:53.320 --> 37:54.924
and he served his country well.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.883
Yes, he did.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.241
So did we all.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.765
Every one of us here.

38:00.880 --> 38:03.724
And we'd do it again
if we had the chance.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.127
What's going on, Sal?

38:06.240 --> 38:08.527
I don't know.
That's-that's why I'm asking.

38:08.600 --> 38:11.251
Shouldn't we be making
funeral arrangements?

38:11.280 --> 38:13.044
Isn't that why we're here?

38:13.120 --> 38:14.565
One second.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.041
Now, were you there
when this happened?

38:17.120 --> 38:18.645
No, I wasn't.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.480
So, where were you?

38:21.560 --> 38:24.131
With all due respect, sir,

38:24.200 --> 38:26.282
that is none of your business.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.408
Oh.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.891
Oh, I see.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.247
With all due respect...

38:33.840 --> 38:37.811
Doc ought to be able to talk
to somebody who was there.

38:37.960 --> 38:40.042
You weren't.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.127
All right.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.043
Were you?

38:53.840 --> 38:56.002
Yes, sir, I was there.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.165
Very well.

38:59.280 --> 39:02.170
Lance Corporal Washington,
tell them what happened.

39:30.040 --> 39:35.001
So, where we at
with all of this?

39:35.080 --> 39:38.323
Pretty much
where we were before.

39:38.400 --> 39:40.971
Doc wants his son's face back.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.401
Can't blame him for that.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.727
Called my wife.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.371
I'm going home.

39:52.440 --> 39:54.681
I'll be taking the bus.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.206
So you're quittin'?

39:57.280 --> 39:59.282
Quittin' what?

40:01.520 --> 40:03.443
Why don't we find out?

40:11.280 --> 40:15.001
So, Doc, what, uh,

40:15.080 --> 40:17.447
what are we gonna do here?

40:18.880 --> 40:21.406
I can't bury him at Arlington.
Not now.

40:22.880 --> 40:25.611
He qualifies and he deserves that honor.
Here.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.523
This is what he looked like.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.204
Can I see it?

40:29.320 --> 40:31.926
Handsome boy.
Wow. Yeah.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.566
High school girls
were crazy about him.

40:35.880 --> 40:38.451
My handsome boy.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.608
I'm taking Larry home.

40:40.720 --> 40:43.371
Sir, I can assure you
that is a bad decision

40:43.440 --> 40:46.887
and you will come to regret it.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.530
Sir, sir, sir, sir.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.523
Please stop.
- Sir, sir.

40:50.600 --> 40:53.444
The marines will transport
the body for you,

40:53.560 --> 40:56.769
at no cost to you,
anywhere you choose.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.205
Sir, sir...

40:58.280 --> 41:00.408
Sir, stop.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.806
I cannot legally release
the lance corporal's body

41:04.880 --> 41:06.928
to anyone,
except a licensed mortician.

41:08.280 --> 41:10.123
Or a clergyman.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.360
Isn't that so, Colonel?

41:13.800 --> 41:14.801
Correct.

41:14.920 --> 41:17.321
Well...

41:18.480 --> 41:19.561
it looks like...

41:21.160 --> 41:24.323
...that will be me.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.884
Lads.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.286
Here we go.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.210
Yeah. There.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.531
Not gonna fit.

42:00.240 --> 42:02.004
How you gonna get him home now?

42:02.120 --> 42:05.283
What you gonna do,
Sal, strap the coffin to the roof of your car?

42:07.200 --> 42:08.645
We could do that.

42:08.720 --> 42:11.530
Just need a little help
lifting it up, huh?

42:11.600 --> 42:13.807
Maybe we can get that kid
with the fucked-up ear.

42:13.880 --> 42:14.961
Don't be ridiculous.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.201
Why not?

42:16.320 --> 42:17.810
You know a better way to be?

42:17.880 --> 42:20.963
You wish you could be ridiculous,
but it's too late now.

42:21.040 --> 42:24.283
Doc, you've got to let the
government transport the body.

42:24.360 --> 42:26.169
I mean, it's the kind of thing
they're good at.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.208
L-I don't like
the government right now.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.810
Well, you don't have to.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.291
I don't trust it anymore.

42:31.400 --> 42:34.165
Hey, you know what,
we could rent a truck.

42:34.280 --> 42:36.965
You know what, let's do that.
Uh, you take the car.

42:37.040 --> 42:39.008
We'll stay here.

42:39.080 --> 42:40.525
Go find a truck.
- All right.

42:40.560 --> 42:43.325
And pay for it out of that.
One truck, comin' up.

42:43.400 --> 42:46.802
I'm coming with you, Sal.
You can drop me at the bus station.

42:46.880 --> 42:49.690
I think I got to be getting
back home now, Doc.

42:51.080 --> 42:54.004
I understand, Mueller.
I'm sorry I dragged you all the way up here.

42:54.080 --> 42:56.321
I really thought I could be
of some help to you, you know.

42:56.400 --> 42:58.482
I mean, I thought
we were going to a funeral.

42:58.560 --> 43:02.326
We are going to a funeral. Just looks like
it's gonna take a little longer to get there.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.004
It's okay.

43:04.080 --> 43:07.163
I'm just glad I got a chance
to... see you again.

43:10.440 --> 43:12.841
I'm very happy
I got to see you again, Doc.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.161
God bless you, Doc.

43:19.280 --> 43:21.203
Keep you in my prayers.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.691
And bless you, too, lad.

43:35.640 --> 43:37.369
Let me ask you something,

43:37.440 --> 43:39.602
man-to-man, hmm?

43:41.720 --> 43:43.882
You ever wonder...

43:43.960 --> 43:47.601
what would've happened,
way back then, if we hadn't...

43:48.440 --> 43:52.445
Doc wouldn't have ended up doing two
years in the brig, that's for sure.

43:53.480 --> 43:58.168
And you and me,
we... wouldn't had to seen what we did.

43:58.280 --> 43:59.486
And what was that?

44:00.800 --> 44:02.484
Are you shittin' me?

44:03.400 --> 44:04.925
You tellin' me you don't remember?

44:05.000 --> 44:07.002
I remember a lot of shit.

44:09.240 --> 44:11.288
What are you talking about?

44:11.360 --> 44:13.601
A certain platoon buddy
getting shot,

44:15.000 --> 44:16.968
writhing around
on the ground dying,

44:17.040 --> 44:19.281
with nothing to give him
to ease his pain

44:19.360 --> 44:21.488
'cause we had already taken
all the morphine.

44:21.600 --> 44:24.490
God rest his soul.

44:24.640 --> 44:26.927
There wasn't nothin'
we could do at that point.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.526
And we did nothin'.

44:31.800 --> 44:34.167
And sometimes
you got to do a little more.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.482
I have a van
that would work for you.

44:51.560 --> 44:53.961
All right.
But I think you might be happier

44:54.040 --> 44:56.327
with a truck that's got
a hydraulic tail lift.

44:56.400 --> 44:57.845
Oh.

44:57.920 --> 44:59.843
Hydraulic lift.
I like that, huh?

44:59.920 --> 45:01.809
What will you be hauling?

45:01.880 --> 45:05.282
Oh, you know, a truck
with a lift will handle it.

45:05.360 --> 45:08.330
Will you be dropping it off back here
or at another location?

45:08.400 --> 45:09.970
Uh...

45:10.040 --> 45:12.122
Don't you know?

45:12.200 --> 45:14.806
No, I guess
I'll be dropping it off here.

45:14.880 --> 45:16.166
And when will that be?

45:17.160 --> 45:18.650
What you lookin' at me for?

45:18.720 --> 45:21.963
I don't know.
How many days would it...?

45:22.040 --> 45:24.122
You don't know how long
you're going to need it?

45:24.240 --> 45:26.891
No, I don't know how long I'll need it.
Give me a week.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.490
Oh, yeah.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.005
A week, he says.

45:30.120 --> 45:33.681
Mueller, come on.
It's out of your hands, all right?

45:33.720 --> 45:35.802
Why don't you sit down,
take a load off,

45:35.880 --> 45:38.360
and let the mountain come
to Muhammad, all right?

45:39.720 --> 45:41.085
Chill.
All right?

45:43.320 --> 45:45.482
I need to see your driver's license.
- Yeah.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.243
Here you go.

45:50.720 --> 45:51.767
Ooh.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.530
These are free, right?

45:54.600 --> 45:56.011
Norfolk, Virginia?

45:56.080 --> 45:57.320
Yeah.

45:57.440 --> 45:58.680
Got to live somewhere.

45:59.800 --> 46:01.086
Will you be the only driver?

46:01.200 --> 46:03.362
Uh, no, no, I'll have some help.

46:03.440 --> 46:06.046
Then I'll need to see
the other driver's license.

46:06.120 --> 46:08.726
- Is it this gentleman here?
- ... thy rod

46:08.800 --> 46:12.247
and thy staff, they comfort me.
- His holiness?

46:12.320 --> 46:16.689
No, no.
His holiness can hardly walk,

46:16.760 --> 46:19.923
let alone handle a big rig
with a hydraulic lift.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.570
Whoever...
I'll need their license.

46:21.640 --> 46:23.244
...I will dwell
in the house of the Lord.

46:23.320 --> 46:25.448
What are you doing, with the bouncing?
What is that?

46:25.560 --> 46:27.164
I'm speaking a psalm.

46:27.240 --> 46:28.526
A psalm?
- Mm.

46:28.600 --> 46:30.204
Oh.

46:30.280 --> 46:34.763
As in, a psalm-a bin Laden.

46:34.840 --> 46:37.241
So, you are the only driver?

46:37.320 --> 46:39.243
Yes, ma'am, I be the wheelman.

46:40.480 --> 46:41.811
How will you be paying?

46:41.920 --> 46:45.322
Oh. Okay.

46:45.400 --> 46:47.323
Take it out of this.

46:47.400 --> 46:48.481
♪ That's the jingle bell ♪

46:48.600 --> 46:51.206
♪ That's the jingle bell rock ♪

46:54.280 --> 46:56.169
16 to 60,

46:56.280 --> 46:59.204
you put a dude behind the wheel
of a big rig like this,

46:59.280 --> 47:00.486
you're gonna feel like hot shit.

47:00.600 --> 47:04.002
This is a rented U-Haul
with an automatic transmission.

47:04.080 --> 47:06.242
This is bigger than anything
you ever handled.

47:06.320 --> 47:08.084
Sal, Doc's boy is dead.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.571
Try not to forget that.

47:09.680 --> 47:12.411
I haven't forgotten that.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.403
Jesus.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.801
But we're still alive, right?
Praise God.

47:16.880 --> 47:19.247
With time ticking fast away.

47:19.320 --> 47:22.608
So if there's one minute that's not too
terrible, I'd like to try to enjoy it.

47:22.680 --> 47:23.920
All right.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.082
I mean, you used to be
up for some fun.

47:26.160 --> 47:27.650
I still am.
- Oh, yeah.

47:27.720 --> 47:29.404
As long as it's right
in God's eyes.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.482
What is that, "God's eyes"?

47:31.560 --> 47:32.721
Wha-What...
God don't have any eyes.

47:32.840 --> 47:34.604
Oh, yes, He does.

47:34.680 --> 47:36.808
Oh, yeah.
God has eyes and He has ears.

47:36.880 --> 47:38.370
Yeah.
And He hears every insult

47:38.480 --> 47:40.050
- that you send His way.
- Geez.

47:40.160 --> 47:43.243
You believe me when I tell you, Sergeant,
there will be a reckoning.

47:43.320 --> 47:44.685
Oh, a reckoning.

47:44.840 --> 47:46.365
Yeah, God as my witness.
All right.

47:46.480 --> 47:47.811
I can assure you of that.

47:47.880 --> 47:49.848
Well, great, then,
because I reckon

47:49.880 --> 47:51.723
that I would take
that opportunity

47:51.840 --> 47:54.002
to stand at attention
and say to God,

47:54.080 --> 47:57.050
"Hey! Where were You when the...

47:57.160 --> 48:00.289
"raping children and the-the
genocide and all that?

48:00.360 --> 48:02.681
"Where were You
when they flew airplanes

48:02.760 --> 48:06.526
"into the buildings and killed thousands of people
"who were just going to work?

48:06.600 --> 48:08.841
"Where were You when Doc's kid

48:08.880 --> 48:11.486
"was just buying Cokes
for his buddies

48:11.560 --> 48:14.370
"and some raghead come up
and shoot his face off?

48:14.440 --> 48:15.851
Huh?
Where were You?"

48:15.920 --> 48:18.651
Yeah, you see,
I'm not gonna stand there

48:18.720 --> 48:20.688
and try to explain myself
to Him,

48:20.760 --> 48:22.728
I'm gonna make God
explain Himself to me.

48:22.840 --> 48:25.525
Oh, all right.
Yeah, and I think by the end of it, He'll say,

48:25.600 --> 48:30.208
"Hey, come on. Get in here.

48:30.280 --> 48:32.886
"You?
You're my kind of dude.

48:32.960 --> 48:35.088
You, give me one of these."

48:36.640 --> 48:38.165
All right, well,
good luck with that.

48:38.240 --> 48:39.844
I'll be praying for you,
you hear?

48:39.920 --> 48:43.208
Yeah, well, I'll be hoping
for the same thing.

48:43.280 --> 48:45.760
But, boy,
if it's a tight-ass God,

48:45.880 --> 48:47.928
then I am fucked.
- Yeah.

48:48.040 --> 48:51.010
And I think it's time for that lube
job on that plate in your head.

48:51.080 --> 48:53.367
Hey, stay the fuck away
from my plate, all right?

48:53.440 --> 48:55.283
I'm picking up WOR from New York.

48:55.400 --> 48:57.004
I'm homesick.

48:57.120 --> 48:59.566
Yeah.
- Hey, wait a minute. Maybe...

49:01.120 --> 49:02.884
Oh, no, no, no.
Well...

49:02.960 --> 49:06.043
You have to turn that shit off.
- So, you know about this stuff, right?

49:06.120 --> 49:07.610
Oh, man.
- All right.

49:07.720 --> 49:11.327
So, you know, I have been known
to get in a face or two.

49:11.400 --> 49:13.721
But even I'm offended
by this stuff.

49:13.800 --> 49:15.404
I mean,
it's damn hard to dance to.

49:15.480 --> 49:19.201
Well, that is one thing that we can finally agree on.
- There you go.

49:19.280 --> 49:23.205
Aren't you a little ashamed
being an African-American?

49:23.280 --> 49:25.726
Mm, no, not really.
Why should I be?

49:25.800 --> 49:29.202
Because being a dignified
gentleman such as yourself,

49:29.280 --> 49:31.328
you would be the first to agree

49:31.440 --> 49:35.729
that this is so far away
from, like, Motown, man.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.802
Right? Well, I have
nothing to be ashamed of.

49:37.920 --> 49:39.649
I mean, this dude is white.

49:39.760 --> 49:42.764
♪ Ever since Prince turned
Himself into a symbol ♪

49:44.480 --> 49:46.562
"White."
- That's affirmative.

49:46.640 --> 49:47.641
Yeah. Yeah.
- White is right.

49:47.760 --> 49:48.966
This guy's white.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.731
Word to God.
- This is coming out of a white mouth?

49:51.840 --> 49:53.490
A white sewer mouth.

49:53.600 --> 49:55.329
Bullshit.
- Mm, nope.

49:55.440 --> 49:56.965
I bullshit you not.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.570
Mm-hmm.
- Fuck me.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.091
♪ Hey ♪

50:00.160 --> 50:02.401
Well, then, I ought to be
a little ashamed.

50:02.480 --> 50:05.802
Only I never really identified
with the white race.

50:05.880 --> 50:08.008
Oh, really?

50:08.120 --> 50:10.964
No. Nothing.
Oh, now I'm curious.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.447
Nope.
Now, what race do you, uh, identify with?

50:14.520 --> 50:16.727
Green.

50:16.800 --> 50:19.770
Green?
- Yeah. The corps.

50:19.840 --> 50:22.320
Okay.
I mean,

50:22.400 --> 50:24.641
it's really the only culture
I ever...

50:24.720 --> 50:26.643
really thought made sense.

50:26.720 --> 50:28.449
♪ Nah-nah, nah-nah-nah ♪

50:28.520 --> 50:30.284
All right.

50:30.360 --> 50:31.885
Let me ask you something.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.047
Hmm?

50:33.160 --> 50:34.366
♪ Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah ♪

50:34.480 --> 50:36.130
Do you ever miss it?

50:36.200 --> 50:38.726
Not for one blessed minute.

50:39.880 --> 50:41.803
I don't believe you.
That's all right.

50:41.880 --> 50:43.211
You don't believe in God either,

50:43.320 --> 50:46.767
but trust and believe
He believes in you.

50:54.600 --> 50:58.127
Hey. No problems?
- No, no problem.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.891
Not unless being trapped on a bus
for seven hours is a problem.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.525
I don't know.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.523
Buses are real nice now.

51:04.600 --> 51:06.807
They got recliners and...

51:06.880 --> 51:09.008
shitters in the back.

51:09.080 --> 51:12.687
Hey, maybe you'll meet some
poor redneck and save his soul.

51:14.720 --> 51:16.802
You get extra points for that?

51:16.880 --> 51:19.326
I mean, does it work off
a point system?

51:19.400 --> 51:21.846
I'll tell you when I get there.

51:23.360 --> 51:25.362
Look, I just hope
I can get some sleep.

51:25.440 --> 51:27.169
I didn't sleep so good
last night.

51:27.240 --> 51:28.571
Yeah, I know, me neither.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.369
Hey.

51:30.480 --> 51:31.720
This will keep you awake.

51:31.800 --> 51:33.529
Want it?

51:33.600 --> 51:37.082
Oh, no.
That'd play havoc with my teeth.

51:37.200 --> 51:41.250
You remember when we could
sleep in a hole in the ground,

51:41.320 --> 51:43.004
bullets whizzing overhead?

51:43.120 --> 51:44.849
Jesus.

51:44.920 --> 51:46.524
You can't go back, Sal.

51:46.600 --> 51:47.931
No.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.605
Who'd want to?

51:49.680 --> 51:52.047
We can't redo the choices
we made back then.

51:52.120 --> 51:54.361
The best we can do
is learn from them

51:54.440 --> 51:56.886
and try to do better in the future.
- I hear that.

51:56.960 --> 51:59.691
But you're still
gonna do it anyway, huh?

51:59.800 --> 52:01.529
Huh?

52:01.600 --> 52:04.444
You're gonna take Doc and his
dead boy back to Portsmouth,

52:04.560 --> 52:06.369
try to make it fun.

52:06.440 --> 52:08.886
Hey, you ought to come with.

52:11.120 --> 52:12.246
Ah?

52:12.320 --> 52:14.641
Come on.

52:19.480 --> 52:20.641
Eh.

52:20.720 --> 52:21.960
Ah, well.

52:22.080 --> 52:23.809
I better get back.

52:25.680 --> 52:26.920
I still can't believe it.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.641
You, of all people, a preacher.

52:32.800 --> 52:34.723
That's goddamn right.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.609
Oh...

52:40.040 --> 52:42.042
Hey, you ever think that, uh...

52:42.120 --> 52:44.566
I don't know, we might bump
into each other again,

52:44.680 --> 52:47.001
you know, from time to time?

52:48.000 --> 52:50.128
I don't know. I mean...

52:50.200 --> 52:53.204
He moves in mysterious ways.

52:54.800 --> 52:56.848
That He does.

52:58.760 --> 53:00.524
All right, Padre,
take care of yourself.

53:00.640 --> 53:03.007
I'll, uh, I'll see you
for Sunday supper.

53:03.120 --> 53:04.531
Bless you.
- Thanks.

53:04.640 --> 53:06.642
Why?
Did I sneeze?

53:11.400 --> 53:14.404
I-I got ya.

53:20.680 --> 53:22.603
All right.

53:24.760 --> 53:26.171
Hang on, Doc.

53:26.200 --> 53:27.690
One, two, three.

53:38.560 --> 53:40.164
You know...

53:40.240 --> 53:42.049
keep wondering, Doc, what...

53:42.160 --> 53:44.242
what your kid would have wanted.

53:46.040 --> 53:47.963
To drink beer with his friends.

53:48.040 --> 53:51.726
Um... to chase girls.

53:51.840 --> 53:54.002
He was only 21.

53:54.080 --> 53:55.491
He wasn't thinking about dying.

53:55.560 --> 53:56.721
Yeah.

53:59.440 --> 54:02.728
You know, Doc, you can make this
a whole lot easier on yourself.

54:02.880 --> 54:06.805
Yeah, I don't want
to make it easy on myself.

54:09.880 --> 54:12.008
Yeah, you're right.

54:12.080 --> 54:15.289
Guys like us, we...
take all that shit

54:15.360 --> 54:17.840
till it's a disaster.

54:17.920 --> 54:20.002
And then we're cool.

54:20.080 --> 54:23.129
The worst has happened,
like we knew it would.

54:26.120 --> 54:28.600
They sent him off
to a godforsaken desert.

54:28.720 --> 54:30.245
Why?

54:32.760 --> 54:35.240
Who knows?

54:35.320 --> 54:37.766
It wasn't to protect America.

54:39.240 --> 54:41.686
It's like that jungle
they sent us to.

54:41.760 --> 54:43.967
It was no threat to us.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.810
And then they send him
back to me in this,

54:48.920 --> 54:51.241
with more lies.

54:51.320 --> 54:54.802
A hero. Honors. Arlington.

54:59.120 --> 55:02.841
Well, I am not going
to bury a marine.

55:04.120 --> 55:06.646
I'm just gonna bury my son.

55:10.760 --> 55:12.649
Yeah.

55:25.320 --> 55:26.924
Taking a bus today?

55:27.000 --> 55:28.923
Yes, to Richmond.
- You?

55:29.000 --> 55:30.161
Richmond, huh?
- Mm.

55:30.280 --> 55:31.850
That home for you?

55:31.960 --> 55:34.930
Uh, no, but... close.
Why?

55:35.880 --> 55:37.928
So, you're the one
they call the Mullah?

55:38.000 --> 55:39.604
The what?

55:39.680 --> 55:41.682
Mullah?

55:43.680 --> 55:45.125
I'm...

55:45.200 --> 55:47.601
waiting for a bus to Richmond,

55:47.680 --> 55:49.489
minding my business,

55:49.560 --> 55:52.848
- reading the Scriptures.
- The Bible.

55:52.960 --> 55:55.691
Checking out the competition?

55:55.800 --> 55:58.531
Who are you two,
and what do you want from me?

55:58.640 --> 55:59.926
That depends.

56:01.040 --> 56:02.451
We're from Homeland Security.

56:02.520 --> 56:05.046
What?

56:08.920 --> 56:10.126
Some rig, huh?

56:19.720 --> 56:21.051
Hold if right there.

56:28.520 --> 56:30.807
It used to mean something,
you know?

56:30.880 --> 56:33.360
Esprit de corps.

56:34.200 --> 56:35.201
A unify.

56:35.280 --> 56:38.807
Some... well-earned pride
and some goddamn common sense.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.723
I don't even know
what it means anymore.

56:40.840 --> 56:42.365
You know what?
Fuck them.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.044
Yeah. Fuck 'em!
Fuck 'em all.

56:44.120 --> 56:45.724
Fuck 'em all, is right.

56:45.880 --> 56:48.565
I spent the best years of my
life defending this country.

56:48.680 --> 56:50.409
Your best years
are still ahead of you, Sal.

56:50.520 --> 56:52.363
Oh, fuck off.
- No, it's true.

56:52.440 --> 56:54.249
Look at me, Doc, all right?

56:54.360 --> 56:56.089
My future is behind me.

56:56.160 --> 56:58.925
I got a scrambled brain held
together with a steel plate.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.685
They look at me and what do they see?
A fuckin' terrorist.

57:01.760 --> 57:03.762
An apology would have been nice.

57:03.880 --> 57:06.406
Yeah.
They're sorry, all right.

57:06.480 --> 57:09.086
They're sorry
they didn't smoke our asses.

57:11.600 --> 57:13.489
Don't get it.

57:19.080 --> 57:20.445
Doc.

57:24.880 --> 57:26.723
Aw, shit.

57:26.800 --> 57:28.689
What, did you forget
your toothbrush?

57:30.000 --> 57:32.128
Jesus.

57:35.400 --> 57:38.529
I had to call my wife

57:38.640 --> 57:41.450
from the police station.

57:41.600 --> 57:43.648
You hear me?

57:43.760 --> 57:46.081
From the police station!

57:46.160 --> 57:47.730
All right.

57:47.800 --> 57:50.451
What happened?

57:50.480 --> 57:55.930
After they ID'd me as
the Reverend Richard Mueller,

57:56.000 --> 57:59.243
found that I am not a Muslim
radical, nor am I a mullah.

58:03.240 --> 58:05.288
Mullah the Mauler!
- Huh?

58:05.360 --> 58:07.761
Oh, fuck, it's all over,
isn't it?

58:07.840 --> 58:09.251
The country's fucked.

58:09.320 --> 58:12.290
Was Ruth upset?
Oh, she was very upset.

58:12.360 --> 58:14.089
Wanted me to come home
right away,

58:14.160 --> 58:15.924
but I said no, no,
no, no, no, honey.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.322
There are times that demand
that even old men

58:19.400 --> 58:20.481
should become threats.

58:20.600 --> 58:22.762
Fuckin' A right.
It's like during the pinko scare...

58:22.840 --> 58:24.330
I thought I was talking.

58:24.400 --> 58:26.129
Yeah, you were.

58:26.200 --> 58:28.646
I told my wife
lam not coming home!

58:28.720 --> 58:30.848
Not until we're done here.

58:32.840 --> 58:33.921
Where's your boy?

58:34.000 --> 58:35.809
They got him again.

58:35.880 --> 58:38.770
Tomorrow we gonna get him back.

58:38.840 --> 58:40.569
And then we're gonna
take him home.

58:46.560 --> 58:48.164
Ten-hut!

58:52.120 --> 58:53.645
Gentlemen, good morning.

58:54.800 --> 58:57.121
So, Colonel
whatever your name is,

58:57.200 --> 58:58.770
where's Larry?

58:58.840 --> 59:01.491
Wilits.
It's Colonel Wilits.

59:01.560 --> 59:02.971
Oh.

59:03.040 --> 59:05.566
I've been briefed
on yesterday's snafu.

59:05.640 --> 59:07.005
Completely ridiculous.

59:07.080 --> 59:10.323
Apparently, the U-Haul agent
went off the deep end.

59:10.440 --> 59:13.046
But there it is,
and what's done is done.

59:21.880 --> 59:24.201
I hope that, given further
time for reflection,

59:24.280 --> 59:26.487
you can see that Arlington
is a resting place

59:26.560 --> 59:28.483
that should not be refused
in anger.

59:30.160 --> 59:32.401
There lie heroes, sir.

59:32.520 --> 59:34.249
The details
of the lance corporal's death

59:34.360 --> 59:36.169
are what they are,
but make no mistake,

59:36.240 --> 59:37.844
his death was heroic.

59:37.920 --> 59:40.366
He was in a foreign
and hostile land

59:40.440 --> 59:42.761
doing the decent thing.

59:42.840 --> 59:46.481
He deserves to lie beneath
the sacred soil of Arlington.

59:46.600 --> 59:50.446
He would want that, and I urge
you to choose that for him.

59:51.680 --> 59:55.446
Thank you. I'm going to take my son
home and bury him in New Hampshire.

59:55.560 --> 59:57.005
And not in his uniform.

59:57.080 --> 59:59.367
I'm gonna bury him
in his graduation suit.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.724
As you wish.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.122
Your government will fly
the coffin, at no cost to you,

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:09.767
to Portsmouth, and to a funeral
director of your choosing.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:12.121
No. We're taking him
with us today.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.083
With all due respect, sir,

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.322
you're cutting off your nose
to spite your face.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.210
Hey. Colonel.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.088
Did you look at these faces?

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.730
They've already been spited,

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.770
so why should we give a fuck
about your opinions?

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.525
With all due respect.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.204
We're gonna take the train.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.484
Okay. I'll make
the arrangements.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.130
Lance Corporal Washington here
will be going with you.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.248
This is Wilits.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.243
I need you to make
some things happen ASAP.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.607
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Wilits.
- Stand by.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.931
We don't need no babysitter.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.724
I wasn't implying that you did.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.121
Washington is on TDY escort duty.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.283
You don't want him,
he goes right back to Baghdad.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.481
Guys?

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.847
We could use the help.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.244
Does he pull per Diem?

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.401
Of course.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.528
Then fall in, Washington.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.244
But he takes orders from us.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.642
He takes his orders...
from me.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.645
But he will accommodate you
in any reasonable way you ask,

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.370
because I just ordered him to.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.766
Is that clear?

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.286
Very clear.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.203
Colonel.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.368
Boy...

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.962
you are a fuckin' force
of nature, huh?

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.844
Man, I would've loved
to run into you in the field

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.524
in my younger days.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.285
You really think so?

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.805
Oh, yeah.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.167
'Cause one of us
would have been fragged.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.766
And the other
would've gone to the brig.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.801
Halt.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.044
Down.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.087
Ready.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.089
Face.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.362
I don't give a fuck
what they say.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.602
You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.165
The lance corporal is ours.

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.328
He's a marine
until he goes into the ground,

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.767
and remains a marine the period
of time he's underground

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.201
plus 100 years, is that clear?

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.850
Yes, sir.
I will not have

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.049
three over-the-hill veterans
pissing on my corps.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.246
Understood?
- Yes, sir!

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:02.483
You're a marine. Your mission
is to see your brother home.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.291
You're in charge, and when
in charge, you take charge!

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.805
Understood?
- Yes, sir!

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.247
There'll be a Mortuary Affairs
detail every step of the way.

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.051
You will protect the dignity
of that dead marine,

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.600
and you will see to it
that he is buried with honors

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.047
in his uniform,
not some cocksucking,

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.205
motherfucking pussy
civilian graduation suit!

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.248
Clear?
- Yes, sir!

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.569
And don't let that Sal fucktard
outflank you.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:29.041
He's old but he's dangerous.
Do not let that happen.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.610
Kill him first.
- Sir?

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.803
That is not an order.
- Yes, sir!

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.810
And just because that
crippled preacher reminds you

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.723
of your father, don't trust him.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.643
I never knew my father, sir.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.449
Lance Corporal, do you have some kind of personal problem?
- No, sir.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.885
Then get on it!
- Yes, sir!

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.321
Ready.
- Hut!

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.405
Ready... face!

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.003
Forward march!

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.284
Well, Washington says
you served.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.488
Yeah. Army.
- Oh, really? Yeah? Yeah.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.324
Did you see some shit?

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.926
Yeah, I was there the first time.
Gulf War.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.764
Right, right.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.444
You came back.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.444
Yes. Yeah,
and I'm not pissing blood.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.364
My babies are all okay.
Hey, that's good.

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.010
John Redman.
- Larry Sheppard.

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.526
Don't worry, I'll...
I'll look after your boy.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.966
Thank you.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.206
Whenever you're ready.

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.491
Okay.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:46.564
Hey, at ease, Washington.
- Huh?

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.163
I got a question for you.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.321
When did you get so old, hmm?

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:23.165
I think it was
over the last 30 years.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.605
Same as you.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.210
Me? No.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.520
Categorically deny it.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.204
Deny if all you want-

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.881
It will not stop the clock,
nor will it turn back time.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.523
So, what do you think
of that grunt, Washington, huh?

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.523
What about him?
- I don't know.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.364
He don't say much.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.965
Him and his Baghdad boil,

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.082
boy, that's
some gnarly shit, right?

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.525
Well, what do you want
to know about him?

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.204
I don't want
to know nothin' about him.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.691
Sounds like he's an individual

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.290
who's heavy
on your mind, though.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.801
Ain't nothin' heavy on my mind.

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.086
Just wondering.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:00.403
Then go back and talk to him,
if he's such a mystery to you.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.927
Everything is a mystery to me.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.928
Except you.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.042
Please.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.927
I think I'll go back
and talk to him.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.968
Oh, I'm sure he'll enjoy that.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.611
Tell him he should come
up here and sit with us.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:22.761
All right.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.127
I'll extend an invitation.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.847
There we go.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.562
This is bleak, man.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.482
You're welcome.
- What for?

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.168
What for?
Are you on a train in Baghdad?

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.686
No, you are not.
- I guess not.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.649
Yeah, TDY.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.643
Sometimes it's fun.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.644
Sometimes it's a bitch.
No, I don't mind.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.007
He was my best friend.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:10.045
Yeah, you didn't, uh, what,
hang with the brothers?

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.770
What the fuck is that?

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.611
I don't know.
I saw it on the MTV, I think.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.125
It's not a rule.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.009
No, I'm not saying it's a rule.

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.804
I liked the dude.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.281
He had my back and I had his.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.966
He was honest,
said what he thought.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.963
Oh, yeah.
Simple, in a good way.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.326
Never had an attitude.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.368
Sounds a lot like his father.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.124
Even the honest part?

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.486
Doc?

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.085
Doc is not a dishonest man.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.491
What about the brig time?

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.562
Fuck, that could've happened
to any one of us.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.284
No, he got fucked.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.408
Doc was a lot younger than us.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.170
He was a kid.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.403
And technically,
he was in the Navy.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.205
Eh.
He wanted to be our friend,

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.602
and... we took advantage of it.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.843
I mean, we had done him a favor,

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.321
and he was doing a favor
for us, and then...

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:04.166
all this shit went down, and
someone had to take the fall.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.004
It was Doc.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.208
Hey,

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:11.682
Look, why don't you come up
with us for a while, huh?

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.127
Redman will look after your buddy. Won't you?
- It's no problem.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.407
That's all right.
- Thank you.

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:18.368
Geez, come on,
you got to get out of here.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:20.680
It's colder than Eskimo pussy.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.841
I don't mind.
Really.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.285
Look“.

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:28.323
I want you to come up and talk
to Larry's father, huh?

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:30.050
Say something nice.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.691
I don't know what I would say.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.609
You'll think of something.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.006
Come on.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:43.091
Boy, oh, boy, look at them-

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.731
Who?
Geez.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.451
And all the shit they bought.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:51.080
Boy, they don't have a clue.
They're just regular people

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.207
out doing their
Christmas shopping, Sal.

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:55.567
Fuckin' sheep is what they are.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.126
I wouldn't mind
being one of them.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.729
Yeah.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.131
It's better than being shot at.

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:03.122
I'd rather be fighting them
over there

01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:04.725
than in our own backyard.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.131
Sound familiar?

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.202
Oh, yeah.

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:10.725
See, we fought the commies
in 'Nam so we wouldn't have

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.484
to fight 'em
on the beaches of Malibu.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.528
Guess it worked.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.082
I... I guess it did.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.322
Yeah, 'cause, uh...

01:09:22.439 --> 01:09:25.091
marines got to be willing
to die on order, so...

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.685
Semper fi.
Do or die.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.770
Yeah, that's always been
the mission, right?

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.241
It's a bunch of crap.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:34.924
Course, you got to have a reason

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.321
to want to even get in a fight
in the first place.

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:39.926
So what are they telling us
it is this time? Huh?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.968
That we're in imminent danger.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.283
That they're stockpiling
weapons of mass destruction.

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:48.170
A possible mushroom cloud.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.447
It's just lies.
It's the same old shit.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.965
You know, stay the course.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.764
If we pull out now,

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:56.650
then all our heroes
will have died in vain.

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.768
You know, blah, blah, blah.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.962
You know, you'd like
to have a little faith

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.280
in your leaders
and your country.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:06.126
I mean, I love this country, I think we're
a good country. Aren't we a good country?

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.123
We are a good country, but...

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.680
if you catch your government
lying to you,

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.286
if changes everything, doesn't it?

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.805
Yeah.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.326
So, kid, how's the living
over there? Hmm?

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.647
It's all right.
- Yeah?

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.166
But they sure fuckin' hate us
over there.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.244
Sound familiar?

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.971
I swear to God, we got to be
the only occupying force

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.247
in history
that expects them to like us.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:33.330
When you go out, you just
never know what to expect.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.641
But... being from Oakland,

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:38.041
I'm used to people dying
all of a sudden.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.929
Geez.
Really?

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:44.651
In high school, one of my best
friends was shot by a stray bullet.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.082
My father, robbed on the street,

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.929
and they put one in him.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.010
I didn't even know who he was
until he turned up dead.

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.003
- Jesus, kid-
- MUELLER: Lord have mercy.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.411
I'm only sayin'.

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.090
So, what, you joined the Marines

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.202
to get away
from all that in Oakland?

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:04.080
No. I didn't have
much else to do, so...

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:07.966
uh... you know, I wanted
to strengthen my character.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.371
It was that way with Larry, too.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.681
You know,
we wanted to test ourselves.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.842
Yeah, boy, we felt
the same thing-

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.684
Mm-hmm.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.161
Every generation has their war.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.246
Men make the wars,
and wars make the men.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.049
Never ends.

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.603
Maybe one day
we'll try something different.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.927
When he was little, Larry used to
like to play with toy soldiers.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.561
Dig trenches for 'em,
put 'em through basic training.

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.971
Mm-hmm.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.724
Mr. Sheppard, Larry was
where he wanted to be.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.290
He hated it.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.044
We all hate it.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.963
But you get sent over there,

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.242
and it stops being
about what you want,

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.731
or the war, even,

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.802
and you're there
for your brothers.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.888
That's all that really matters.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.723
He must have been embarrassed,

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.724
me sitting out the last part
of our war in the brig.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.002
No, sir.

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.248
He wasn't embarrassed at all.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:16.009
Thing that made Larry different
from the rest of us in the unit,

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.009
he had a happy childhood.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:20.924
He said that?
- Yes, sir.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.447
He had a mother and father that
loved him, loved each other.

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.649
And... nice house to live in,

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.644
good food to eat,
and he went on about school

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.042
and football and...
nice friends.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.610
And he loved you.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.049
Mm-hmm.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.969
Mr. Sheppard, it was my turn
to get the Cokes.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.805
That was my bullet, not Larry's.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.166
Mm-mm. No.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.651
No, no, no.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.766
A gray car pulled up
in front of the house.

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.490
Marine lieutenant,
Navy chaplain...

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.810
shiny brass belt buckles.

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.406
I kept staring
at those shiny buckles.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.370
"The president has asked me
to express his deep regret."

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.164
Killed in action.

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.969
In action.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:36.088
Nothing about shot in the back of the
head getting Cokes for his buddies.

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.244
Nothing about...

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.891
killed while...

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.763
delivering supplies
to the Baghdad school system.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.600
There we go.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.602
There... we go.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.449
Ah-ha.

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.730
Hmm? Thirsty?

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.406
That went down awfully quick.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.721
Yeah, well, I'm drinking for two

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.882
now that you got
all old and boring.

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.644
It might be
that you're an alcoholic.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.569
You think?

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.165
Well, I am.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.123
Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.283
But I recognized it, see?

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.527
Took ownership of it.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.931
That was the first step.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.445
Mm-hmm.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:01.326
Why don't you take ownership
of this beer?

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.129
Huh?
Come on. Don't...

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.771
Well, I'm...
I'm very good right now.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.047
With this coffee, I'm fine.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:12.489
Hey, at least
we're not drug addicts.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.924
Thank... God.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.490
Not anymore.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.085
"Not anymore."

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.770
We never were.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.922
We took the shit, Sal.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.526
Yeah.
'Cause we needed the shit.

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.642
No.
We needed it,

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.563
the corps
would've issued it to us.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.962
Yeah.
In a way, they did.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.963
That shit was meant for pain.

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.326
All drugs are.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.448
So? What's wrong
with taking it, then?

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.364
Morphine... is addictive.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.124
Yeah, so is pain.

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.170
We weren't the ones
who were in pain, though.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.322
The fuck we weren't.

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:51.971
Different kind of pain.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.402
Pain is pain.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.330
When we get to the next stop,
I got to call Ruth.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.849
You know what you need?

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.207
You need one of those
mobile telephones.

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.647
You could be talking
to Ruth right now.

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.246
Even on this train, you could be talking.
- Say what?

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.523
Yeah, I mean,
every ten-year-old has them.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:22.404
They practically stopped
making pay phones.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.685
So-so,
we ended up at Disneyland

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.684
to resuscitate Doc,
who is metaphorically drowning.

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.524
Geez, I got your metaphoricals
right here.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:53.206
- Stick to the story. Come on.
- Wait, hold on. Let me, let me follow.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.726
So there's a Disneyland
in Vietnam?

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.363
Well, yes, young blood.

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.649
That's what they call
the whorehouses and the bars

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.285
that spring up around the base.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.926
And it was the company
fucking commander's doing.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.729
You see, he was
the one who told us,

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.609
"Hey, you need
to take a few days off

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.250
"and get Doc's ass to Disneyland

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:18.089
before he has a total meltdown."

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:19.889
I was having some problems.

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.883
Yeah, you sure as shit were.

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.042
And the number one problem
he was having is that

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.929
it was time for him
to get his cherry busted.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.809
Oh.
So... yes.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.251
Hey, Washington, before you...

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.243
how-how-how old were you,
first time?

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.446
Thirteen.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.646
Good Lord, man.

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:34.727
Whoa!
What?

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.610
Ah, yeah, 13!
Goodness.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.165
I rest my case.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.441
You see?
Lord have mercy.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.608
See, Doc-Doc was 18.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.120
- I was 19.
- 19.

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.680
One year worse than 18.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.245
- That's not worse.
- It was time.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.642
No.No, no.
The right time was when I met Mary

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.331
and we committed to each other.
- Oh, what? Come on.

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:59.121
Look, I-l just want to say that I think
that 13 is still way too young, by the way.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.929
A-All right. All right,
all right, all right.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.924
So, anyway, we're in Disneyland.
We're looking.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.764
There's Tomorrowland.
There's Fantasyland.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.649
And then we found

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:11.441
one of the most beautiful whorehouses I
have ever seen- And I've seen a lot-

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.090
Uh, I don't, I don't know.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:16.446
What?

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:19.683
I... just... paying for sex,
you know, whores, pimps,

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.127
it's... kind of disgusting.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.645
Actually, it wasn't that bad.

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.649
Yeah!

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.046
There's my guy!

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.731
Yeah!

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.650
Well, it was, it was okay.
It was nice.

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.802
- Oh!
- Truth be told,

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.120
our Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ,

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.690
had not yet entered
into my heart.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.644
Oh, God, please save me.
And so, I yielded to...

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.006
bad impulses.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:44.003
"Yielded."
Do you hear that?

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.650
He "yielded."
That is correct.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.882
No, I'll tell you
what he did with impulses.

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:50.167
He drank impulses, right?
- Yes.

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:53.005
He smoked impulses.
- Yes.

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.202
And he fucked impulses.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.487
Yes, I confess.
He fucked impulses.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.324
He was... no, you know
what his nickname is?

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.004
Mueller the Mauler.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.048
He was famous
for the five-dollar,

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.009
five-minute special. Right?
- Yeah.

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:07.003
I mean, he was
like a jackrabbit.

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:09.606
"I don't want to
spend any more money there."

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:14.002
Aah!
That's my bad leg, man!

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.003
That's my bad leg. Shit.

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.320
Son of a bitch.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.600
Come on, man.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.246
I was also famous for whipping
a motherfucker's ass.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:31.769
Listen, if was all...

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:34.207
Seems very funny right now.

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.441
It was funny.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.842
Yeah, well, it was pure
dereliction of duty, sir.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.327
Dereliction of duty, pure and simple.
Remember that.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:44.882
Actually, it... it was like
going to a friend's house.

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.886
And then... then you just...

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.281
then you have sex
with the friend.

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.086
Then what?

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.286
And then...

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.602
...you'd give 'em money.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:02.926
Then you'd pay your friend.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.083
- That's right.
- Oh, I got to tell you,

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.766
we did get tired
of listening to him

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.081
talking about that beautiful
Asian whore of his, right?

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.601
- Oh, man-
- SAL: He was so proud-

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.921
He said he had a hard-on so big,

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:19.327
felt like he was
in a full-body cast.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.482
It's like nothing can move.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.251
He couldn't blink and he
couldn't even move his fingers.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.448
Oh. That's... that's not...

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.090
...that's not true.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.481
Oh, fuck me,
I miss those days...

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.444
when you had a...

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.921
a boner
you could hang a towel on.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.401
Jesus.

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:42.605
I used to have a Johnson that would
stand up and watch me shave.

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.842
Oh, like this.
Like, "How you doing?

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:46.689
"Yeah? You all right?

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.531
How is your day so far?"

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:52.849
Now... now it watches me
pull up my socks.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.405
Just like, "All right."

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.010
When it goes, it goes.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.481
It goes. Goes quickly, too.
- Don't encourage this.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.369
Don't encourage this, Washington.
- Goes fast.

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.641
Oh, man.

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.484
- Keep using it, though.
- Okay.

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.130
- You don't...
- I'm imagining...

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:16.889
I'm imagining his penis
helping him pick up his socks.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:23.291
Just what does that look like?

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:35.888
I'm home. Huh?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.971
New York.
New fucking York.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.730
Well, let's not wander too far.

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:44.485
No, no, no, just far enough to
find the first Blarney Stone,

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:47.928
which... I believe is this way.

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.122
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
This way.

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:55.887
Take that in.

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.325
Take a deep breath.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:00.006
What, you do it?
What do you smell?

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:03.084
There's one distinct smell.
What is it?

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.362
Urine. I love it.

01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:07.164
It's like the official scent
of the city.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.242
Huh?

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.683
All right.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:17.004
♪ Buh-buh-buh-buh-da
Blarney Stone ♪

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:21.005
Barkeep, I will have
one more drink

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.441
and then one more after that.

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.081
See, this is what we call a man
with a drinking problem.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.401
This, right here.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.687
I ain't got no problem.
I got this mastered.

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.969
Born in pain, live in fear,
die alone.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.447
Could you be any more Irish
right now?

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:40.245
Could you possibly be
any more Irish right now?

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.322
No, I do not think I can be.

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.165
Although, I will confess to you

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:48.847
my-my mother is
actual! Y half Italian.

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.968
I lost one.
He lost two.

01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:58.569
Yeah, well, guess
he thought it was worth it.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:04.042
It's not worth it to me.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.605
Wonder if it's worth it
for his daughters.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:12.286
He's got twins, right?

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.089
Who?
Oh, the cheerleader?

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.321
Who?

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:17.129
Well...

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.407
He was a cheerleader in college

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:21.403
before he was the president.

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.244
Would it be worth their lives?

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.368
Even one of them?

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.283
Doc...

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.761
Look, kid...

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:32.969
there's no answers in there.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.288
Right? The answers you're
looking for can be found

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.204
in petition and prayer.
Okay. Thank you.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:42.608
Okay. You guys ready for an adventure?
- Yup.

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.170
Huh? Let's go.
Let's hit it.

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.368
Where are we going?
Uh, it's a secret.

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.805
You'll find out
when you get there,

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.609
just like heaven.
- Oh, I don't like the sound of this.

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.125
Just like heaven.

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:58.281
How many minutes
do I get on this again?

01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.521
On this plan...
Yeah.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.483
...500.

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.289
Every month?

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.805
Yes.

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.325
Is that enough?

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:08.801
"Enough?"
Yeah.

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.804
How can anybody talk for more
than 500 minutes a month

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.291
on a fucking telephone?
That's a good point.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.970
Pardon my French.
No, it's a good point.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.530
I mean...
We're going to miss our train

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.329
- as sure as God
made little, green apples.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:23.361
We're not gonna miss it. Calm down, calm down.
And if you call people with the same plan,

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:25.090
doesn't count
against your minutes.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.204
That's-that's one hell of a plan.
- It is.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:29.725
Well, what do you care
who's on the plan?

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:32.161
You don't know anybody on the plan.
- I know you two fuckers.

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:33.651
Come on, let's get some phones.

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:35.722
I don't want one.
I don't need one.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:37.365
Thank you.
I wouldn't mind having one,

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.851
to tell you the truth.
- Hey!

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:41.002
Oh, Lord.
- I've often thought about it

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:44.448
Barkeep, a round of phones for my partners here.
- Right.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:47.000
Okay, so he and I can talk
to each other any time,

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.048
even though he's in Norfolk
and I'm in New Hampshire,

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.122
and it's not gonna
cost us anything?

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.202
- That's the deal.
- Wow.

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.805
Don't believe it.
Come on, Mueller.

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.962
What?
- Mueller. Come on.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.451
With the three-way
calling thing,

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.403
we can talk to each other
at the same time.

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:02.960
Yeah, but aren't we talking to each
other at the same time right now?

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.520
But we'll be on phones.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.206
All right, what
if I don't like it?

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:11.409
I mean, we get stuck with a contract
for what, a year, two years?

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:12.720
- Just two years.
- Two years.

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.290
What if you fall down?

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.691
Have you thought of that? Huh?
- Yeah.

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:17.728
With your gimpy legs,
that's a real possibility.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.925
What if you fell into a ditch, and you
can't get up and nobody can see you?

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.287
I mean, it is adios, padre.

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.371
But, ah, with your mobile
phone, you get it out

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.205
and if you can see the numbers,
your glasses are...

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:34.363
like, "Oh, I can't see.
Help me. Help me.

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:36.209
I've fallen and I can't get up."

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.205
Guys, 911 calls don't count
against your minutes, either.

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.402
That's... come on, that's...

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.811
All right, all right, all right.
- Yeah!

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.531
If I say yes, will you shut the
hell up so we can get our train?

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.125
I'll shut up.
Okay.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.322
Yeah!

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.481
Come on!

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.241
Hello.
- Hello. This is God. Is this Reverend Mueller?

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.924
Who's this? Say what?
- God.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.923
Uh, you're not' gonna get'
info heaven after all.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.002
What the...?
I'm very displeased with the way

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.684
you're talking about fornicating with whores.
- Who is this?

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.205
I say, who is...
- This is God.

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.446
Wha...
- This is definitely God.

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:25.285
Hey, hey. Sal. Stop.
- What? This is not Sal. This is God.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:26.964
Stop it now.
- This is God...

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.883
Burning up my minutes
with that foolishness.

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:32.282
Wait. You should call John Redman on the train.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.486
Here.

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.689
This will be
my second official call.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.970
Uh-huh.

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:44.442
By the way, when you call God,
doesn't cost you any minutes.

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.091
He told me.

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:49.886
Hey, John Redman.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.843
Guess who this is.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.002
Yeah.
How'd you know?

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:56.367
All right, l-listen,
lam calling you

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:59.967
from my brand-new mobile
cellular cordless telephone.

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.566
That you don't even know how to use.
- Hush up.

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.808
Listen, I want to give you
my number, all right?

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.326
How do you already have it?
I didn't give it to you.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.801
It comes up on his.
- Hey, that's just what he said.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.484
The number comes up
on the screen!

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.846
Can you believe this?

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.365
Wow.
Okay, listen up.

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:16.442
Uh, we are on...

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.921
Huh?
Ah.

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:21.771
Okay. Okay.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.291
Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:25.930
Okay. All right.

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.530
What's going on?

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:31.844
They are on their way
to Boston, so...

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:33.331
The train left without us?
- Yeah.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:34.686
Outstanding.

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.649
Outstanding.
- What?

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:39.849
I warned you, didn't I? Didn't I warn you?
- What does it matter?

01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.684
We miss this train,
we'll take the next one, okay?

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.205
There's, like,
a million trains to Boston.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:45.004
Mm-hmm.
- You know what? You worry too much.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.730
That's why your hair
went so gray.

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.246
You worry too much.

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.084
This is a boarding call

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.123
for Amtrak Acela Express train 2171

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.685
en route to Washington

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.524
with intermediate stops
at Newark,

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.206
Philadelphia,
Wilmington, Baltimore...

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:02.130
We are all set.

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.129
We're on the express
straight to Boston.

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.890
When?
- 7:00 a.m.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.371
Oh, geez.

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.522
Come on. It's the city
that never sleeps.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:10.806
Why should we?

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:12.046
Come on.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.645
Let's have some fun.

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.728
Now, you take

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.290
the fade-a way jump shot-

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:20.085
Ooh, wow,
it's a beautiful thing of beauty.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:22.561
Free throws are what win
or lose a game, though.

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:24.404
Oh, fuck.
That is... they're so boring.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.881
It's true.
But they're boring.

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:29.930
It stops all the action
all the time.

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:32.923
And there's way too many
of those fuckin' things.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.729
You're not supposed
to go in there,

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.486
banging around with a guy,
banging all the time.

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.410
Fouls... no, I'm serious,

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.608
fouls...

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.489
should be...

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.764
shameful.

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.444
You know?
Hmm.

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.841
But there's no fuckin' shame
anywhere anymore.

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:55.327
Look who's talking.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.765
You ever been ashamed of anything
you've ever done in your life?

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.001
Ever?

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.009
Once.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.648
Why are you looking at me
like that?

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.927
You know why.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.004
Did you remember
that Boston was where...

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:17.761
he was from?

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:20.047
I remember he was from Boston.

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:23.163
So I've been looking into...

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:27.768
seeing if I could find maybe he
still had some... family there.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.042
- Why?
- 'Cause...

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.366
'Cause he's drunk, that's why.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:34.046
What-what does that
got anything to do with it?

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.049
You get like this
every time you drink?

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.690
Pretty much.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.725
Then you shouldn't drink.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:43.610
It's what I got instead of God.

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:45.284
Uh-huh, I see.
I understand.

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.289
I got God.
- Yeah.

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:49.971
Doc did his time.

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.168
You got drunk.

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.691
Yep.

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.125
Yeah.

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.527
Maybe he got the better
of the deal.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.171
He was gonna die anyway, Sal
- No. No.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.730
He didn't have to suffer.

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:04.569
Not like that.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.569
- But he did.
- No.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.005
Jimmy Hightower.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.041
We can't even say his name.

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:18.849
We all feel guilty about how
he suffered when he was dying,

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:20.684
but did it ever occur to you

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.684
that maybe nobody
would have been shot

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:26.331
and everybody'd still be alive

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.922
if we had just been doing
our jobs, not fuckin' around?

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:44.887
Boarding call for Amtrak Acela
Express train 2150 to Boston

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.240
with no intermediate stops.

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:49.051
Passengers should proceed to track 23.
- Sal.

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.531
Sal.

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.807
Sal, we gotta go.

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:55.491
We gotta go.
We gotta get our train.

01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:57.921
Mueller.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.809
Time to go.

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.928
Can I ask you
a personal question?

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:31.922
No.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.729
Thank you.

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.764
Why is it that you married
a black woman?

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:39.081
Oh, what?

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:43.051
Come on.
It's not like you never had a white woman before.

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.805
I know better.
And it was the '70s and all that.

01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:48.326
Which, if I remember rightly,

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:51.086
was when you white dudes

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:53.925
admitted to having a thing
for black women.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.287
I'm gaga for the sisters.

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:58.681
They dig me, too.

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.848
Couple of 'em.

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.644
For a time.

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:05.485
First of all, Sal,

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.528
who I married
is none of your business.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:10.968
And that is why
I'm being so polite about it.

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:12.963
Okay, I'll tell you.

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.611
God told me to.

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:19.490
God told you
to marry a black woman?

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:20.965
No.

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:23.008
God told me to marry Ruth.

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.287
Hmm.

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:28.011
How come God don't talk to me?

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.764
Because you don't listen.

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:31.001
I hear just fine.

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:33.447
You hear just fine,
but you don't listen.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:38.850
So you listen, and that's why
He talks to you.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.524
That's not what I said.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.648
Mm.
I said that God

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:44.688
told me to marry Ruth,

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.649
to be a good man,

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.643
and to preach the Word.

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.651
So He does talk to you.

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:55.007
He touched my heart.

01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:59.531
Maybe it was Ruth who touched your heart.
- Oh, yes.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.483
It was God through Ruth.

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:04.086
I was a down-and-out,

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.521
recovering alcoholic
with a shot-up leg,

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:09.410
and one day...
I found Jesus.

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.323
Where?
Where'd you find Him?

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.568
Like, on a street corner
or something?

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.165
No, in my heart, Sal.

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:18.242
The only place
you can truly find Him.

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.722
I went deep inside my own heart
like it was some scary cave,

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:24.041
some... unexplored place.

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:25.889
Which it was.

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:29.851
Went down alone and afraid,
and came back up fearless,

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:32.890
with Jesus by my side,
and there...

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.367
the very next Sunday,

01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:38.046
took myself to church.

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:41.124
And there was Ruth?
And there was Ruth.

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:45.086
And everything fell
into place for me.

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:48.129
That is a beautiful story.

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.402
Sorry the fuck I asked.

01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:57.211
So, if God exists...

01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.447
I mean, would it kill Him

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.329
to just tap me
on the shoulder or something,

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:03.329
just shake my hand like a man?

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.243
And, while He's at if,

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:09.244
if He could deliver a nice
black girl with a great ass,

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.481
so much the better.

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:12.681
Hey, hey, hey-

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.728
Lei' me ask you
another question-

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:16.928
When Ruth was a child,

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.128
was she a Baby Ruth?

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.328
You get... you get it?

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:24.768
- You know what Christmas is for me?
- What?

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.490
A Doc Holiday.

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:33.051
That's good, Doc.

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.048
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, tha-that's the one.

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:40.441
That's the one we want.

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:43.410
What do you think he's up to?
- Oh, wheelin' and dealin'.

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:46.370
Mr. Cellular Phone!
- All right. All right. All right, fellas,

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.369
we got an errand to run.
Do we even have time?

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:49.925
Oh, yeah,
we've got plenty of time.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.764
I was just on with Redman.
He and Washington

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:54.810
are already in New Hampshire,
so we'll see 'em there.

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:59.124
I don't know how I lived without this thing.
I really don't.

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:24.727
Detail! Forward hut!

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.406
I eff. I eff.

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:34.885
I eff.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.840
She's been living with if
all these years, anyway.

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.720
What good is it gonna do her?
We are long overdue, the way I figure.

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:54.843
She ought to know the truth, and we
ought to be men enough to say it.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.889
How did you even find her?

01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:00.122
I got O'Toole to call
his granddaughter,

01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:02.441
and she looked it up for us
on the World Wide Web.

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.164
What can we possibly say to her?

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:06.083
We say the truth.

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.204
- It's a little bit further.
- And two...

01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:12.363
Couple more on the left there.
Right there. There it is.

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.363
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh, this-this red...

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:17.091
Yeah-That's if-
- MUELLER: - - - staircase here-

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.448
All right.

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.402
Maybe she's not here.

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.404
Hey, we didn't come
all this way...

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:37.245
Mrs. Hightower?
- Yes?

01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:39.084
I'm, uh,
Reverend Richard Mueller.

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:40.650
I served with your son
in Vietnam.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:42.842
Oh, yes.
One moment, please.

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:49.246
Welcome.
- Thank you.

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.890
Come on in.

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:52.724
Hi. Name is Sal.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.723
Welcome.
- Hi. Larry Sheppard.

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.804
- So glad you could come.
- Thank you, ma'am.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.321
I'm gonna show you
some pictures.

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.410
This one...

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.601
That's the last one
we ever got from Jimmy.

01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:13.006
Look at him.

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.565
Hmm?
Yeah.

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.011
- Remember that smile?
- Sure do.

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.162
- He was a handsome man, wasn't he?
- Yes, he was.

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:19.805
Oh, Lord have mercy.

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:21.086
And this

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.889
is his little girl.

01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:25.281
All grown up now.
- My Lord.

01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:31.081
My Lord.

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:33.925
How old was she when he died?

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.480
Four months.

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:41.168
Her mom eventually remarried,
and they moved to San Diego.

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:43.208
Mm.

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:46.163
And these,

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.888
they're my great-g rand.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.126
Hmm?

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:55.602
Look at that.

01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.085
He'd be a grandfather.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.482
I never saw them in person,
but they calls.

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:05.847
Mm.
Every now and then.

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.323
So...

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:12.449
you three men
were with my Jimmy.

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:13.646
Yes, ma'am.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.404
3rd Marine Division.

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:17.642
We were a very fight unit-

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:19.324
Ma'am.

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:21.368
It's like this.

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.568
Uh, see“.

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.328
We had already fought us

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:29.402
a good long year,

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.489
and most of us

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.642
were still breathing.

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:39.965
But the extension...

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:44.003
that... that four months
they added on,

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.491
that was...

01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:48.651
that was bad.

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:50.848
And...

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.922
some of us...

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.247
we just couldn't handle it, see,

01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:59.041
and, uh, I-I don't
even think that, uh...

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.208
What was it for?

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:02.611
Hmm?

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.604
What was it all for?

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:10.927
Right, well...

01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:13.964
they said they knew,
and we just believed them.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.367
But now...

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:25.051
Mrs. Hightower,

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:28.283
we came here today
to tell you what happened.

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.803
Were you...

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:38.247
...were you some of the men
he saved?

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.651
I mean...

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:42.889
were you some of the men

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.450
whose lives Jimmy saved?

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:46.568
I mean, they told me
that he saved

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:49.086
three or four of his buddies
before he was killed.

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:53.011
Were you?

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:56.088
Were you?

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:02.889
Yes, ma'am, that was us.

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:07.008
Jimmy was...

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.650
a great guy.

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:12.166
Yep.
Never forget him.

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:15.842
That's why we're here, ma'am.

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:18.406
Uh, we feel we owe him.

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:21.448
Yeah.

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:24.763
We just wanted to come by
to pay our respects.

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:27.286
And, you know,
let you know

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:30.842
that he's always been
in our hearts.

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:34.323
God bless you.

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:38.441
I can never thank you enough.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:44.891
Mrs. Hightower,

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:47.201
very glad to have met you.

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:49.322
Me, too, son.
Me, too.

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.482
Thank you, ma'am.
- Take care.

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.324
Bye.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:55.442
Bless you, Mrs. Hightower.

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.486
Uh...

01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:57.926
looks like they used
to make things here.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.684
Used to.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.049
That's the operative word,
"used to."

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:10.849
Jesus, I got to piss.

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:37.208
Ah...

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.009
Ah...

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.202
Ha-ha.

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.486
Oh...

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:47.126
Hey, Mueller.
- Yeah?

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:48.964
Now I see God.

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:53.286
Sal, if you had any more
manners you'd be a dog.

01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:10.524
You gonna want
to stay on here alone?

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:15.924
Well, I hadn't really
thought much about it.

01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:19.083
Portsmouth. Boy.

01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:23.087
With the brig right there.

01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:27.531
Might want to try another place.

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:30.206
Fresh start.

01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:32.362
But Larry'll be here.

01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:33.930
Mary, too.

01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:36.520
You could always visit.

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:39.400
Hey.

01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:41.608
You got close friends here?

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.403
Not too many.

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.846
Not too close.

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:53.724
Move to Norfolk.

01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:56.371
You can work in my bar.

01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:00.604
I don't know anything
about working in bars, Sal.

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.127
Trust me, you don't need
to know much.

01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:06.641
Well, your bar
doesn't seem that busy.

01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.683
No, it ain't.

01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:10.489
But that's my fault, see?

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:13.285
I let it go.

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:15.288
It just needs some...

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:17.926
new blood, you know?

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.807
We can get the grill part
going again, boy.

01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:26.166
I need a partner.

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:28.282
A partner?
- Yeah.

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:30.687
The bar would be half yours.

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:34.009
Then, when I bite it,
it'd be all yours.

01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:35.485
Sal, you don't owe me anything.

01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.768
No, no, hey, this has nothing
to do with, you know,

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.126
paying back a debt.

01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:41.646
Trust me.

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:44.485
I really do need a partner.

01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:50.771
You could stay with me.

01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:53.241
For a while. Then you'd
have to get your own place,

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:57.126
'cause I like to pursue the ladies,
if you know what I mean.

01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:01.888
And quite frankly, no offense,
but you'd cramp my style, Doc.

01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:11.009
You thinking about it?

01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:13.970
I am.
I'm picturing it.

01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:16.361
It's kind of funny.

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:18.323
Yeah.

01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:23.050
Might be time for a new BOD
in your life, huh?

01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:26.403
Better career decision.
There you go.

01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:30.366
If nothing else, I guarantee it,

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:33.250
we'd have some fun.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:37.364
What's wrong with that?

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.648
You are in love with that thing.

01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:46.408
Look at you, you can't even put it down.
- No, I'm trying to get that fucker O'Toole to answer.

01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:49.649
You know, the whole place
could be burned down for all I know.

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:51.245
Come on, you dick.

01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:58.848
Well,

01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:01.082
there it is,
Larry's graduation suit.

01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:05.843
- Oh, that's nice.
- Very nice, Doc.

01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.126
Looks a little small.

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:09.726
You think?
- Yes, sir.

01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:11.723
Larry bulked up,

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:14.007
so that might be
a little tight on him now.

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:16.400
Oh, okay.
Well, I guess

01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:19.250
I could go down to Penney's
and get him something new.

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:22.324
Well, we do still have
his dress blues.

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:25.051
Oh, my word.

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:27.248
The dress blue uniform.

01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:29.209
Remember how we used to call it?
The tuxedo.

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:31.248
The tuxedo. Yeah.Yeah.

01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:33.607
'Cause by law, you could wear
it to any formal function.

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:36.200
Not that we ever
got invited to one,

01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:38.328
or would have gone
even if we had.

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:41.449
Still, it was nice to know
you were always dressed

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.329
for any occasion.

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:46.802
That's true, and e men
never forgets the first time

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.484
he puts on that uniform,
let me tell you.

01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:49.931
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- Huh?

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.445
Didn't you stand in front

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:52.891
of the mirror
looking at yourself?

01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:54.610
Right?
Ooh!

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:58.401
I am in the United States Marine
Corps, and I look pretty fucking good-

01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:00.881
I remember loving that feeling.

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:03.406
Yes, sir.
Glad to know that never changes.

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:06.723
Ooh, I bet Larry looked sharp
in his, didn't he?

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:09.610
Oh, he did.
Yeah, he was proud as a peacock in it.

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:11.569
Mm.
I know that for a fact, sir.

01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:15.242
You know,
and that's the point, Doc.

01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:17.129
It's about pride.

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.531
And it's not a sin.

01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:22.207
Oh, no, not that kind
of pride, no, sir.

01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:23.964
I guess I could...

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:27.527
bury him in his uniform,
even if...

01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:29.529
Yeah, you could.

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:31.682
Yeah.
Means you did something.

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:32.761
You know, you served.

01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:35.810
Fuck what the politicians did.
You served.

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:38.486
Right?
You didn't try to weasel out of it,

01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:40.767
- or think it was somebody else's job.
- Nope.

01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:43.923
You took it on, man,
and you looked sharp doing it.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.082
Like a man.

01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:51.530
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
bury him in his uniform.

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:54.890
- That's good, Doc.
- Mmm.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.162
Never regret it, sir.

01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:00.289
- Fuckin' A.
- Okay.

01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:09.328
Hey.
Washington.

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:11.971
You ever relax, huh?
Why don't you sit down?

01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:18.686
That's it, huh?

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:22.207
Okay.
Yeah, much better.

01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:48.407
Why are you looking
at me like that?

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:52.168
I'm sizing you up.

01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:56.048
You know what?

01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:00.170
I am gonna get you
a new suit of clothes.

01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:02.521
Say what?
- Yup.

01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:05.080
I'm gonna dress you up
for the occasion.

01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:07.004
May I ask why?

01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:10.567
Well... because I love you.

01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:14.807
Hey. Mm-hmm.

01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:22.929
First of all, uh, I don't need
a new suit of clothes.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.765
Yeah.
Second of all,

01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:29.401
you're the one who could
really use some grooming.

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:33.201
And third of all, neither one
of us are dressed properly.

01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:35.089
But we're gonna be.
You watch.

01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:37.481
Oh, the things that come into
your head and out of your mouth.

01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:40.410
Scary, right?

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:42.801
You know what I think?

01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:45.929
I think that "I love you" thing really
rattled you, didn't it old man?

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.002

Doc, I don't know

or how much the president
regrets your loss and all that,

01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:56.283
but... here it is.

01:52:58.240 --> 01:52:59.924
Your country's flag.

01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:03.647
Thank you.

01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:07.447
You put that somewhere
and let it remind you

01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:09.688
of what was in your son's heart.

01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:47.366
We don't know...
I know. It's...

01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:49.283
Well, once you're a marine,

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:50.964
you're always a marine.

01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:53.407
And even though I'm no longer
on active duty...

01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:55.084
But if I was...
- Yeah.

01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:57.970
...I ask you, you see
a man in this uniform?

01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:00.088
Huh?
Could you resist all this?

01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:01.924
Huh?
I, um...

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.526
No, I...
I don't think I could.

01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:05.601
Mm-hmm.

01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:07.842
It's the uniform,
or the man in the uniform?

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:11.407
It's a killer combination.
- It's the combination. Isn't it?

01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:12.720
Kind of seductive.

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.211
Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:16.926
You are a very perceptive
young lady.

01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.130
We all wrote one.

01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:34.606
I gave mine to Larry,
and he gave his to me.

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.126
What does it say?

01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:47.966
I-I don't know, Mr. Sheppard.

01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:52.167
Hmm.

01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:54.123
Okay.

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:21.245
I'm just saying,
when you think about it,

01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:23.761
a young man is struggling
out of the gate,

01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:26.531
goes on a date, has to
borrow his dad's car,

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:28.364
- needs to borrow a couple bucks.
- WOMAN Yes-

01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:30.005
Whereas, an older,
established gentlemen

01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:32.242
doesn't have to do any of that, right?
- Sal?

01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:34.362
No...
- I need you to come with me right now.

01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:36.090
Can you see I'm a little busy?
- I can.

01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:39.687
I'm gonna have to borrow him for a few minutes right now.
- Does this have to happen right now?

01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:42.001
Right now. Doc needs us.
Double quick, son.

01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:43.884
I'll be right back.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:45.530
We'll pick this up. Okay.
- Yeah.

01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:48.444
Bye, Sarge.

01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:56.441
You all right?

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.170
You got to open it, Doc.

01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:20.246
He wanted you to have it.

01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:26.040
Hmm.

01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:40.970
Dear Dad,

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.241
if you are reading this,
then you've been notified.

01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:44.970
I was always prepared

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.611
to sacrifice my life
for my country.

01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:50.763
You have to be ready to die
defending what you love.

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:52.524
I need you to understand

01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:54.802
that I am honored
to die in this way.

01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:57.326
Don't feel bad
that my life was so short.

01:56:57.400 --> 01:56:59.448
It was a good life.

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:02.569
I know you never wanted me
to join the Marines,

01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.927
but you supported me even so.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.607
I had the greatest father,
and I love you.

01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:10.603
Now I am with Mom.

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:13.126
We will both watch over you.

01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:17.091
Dad, I want you to bury me
in my uniform next to Mom.

01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:21.528
Your loving son, Larry.

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:31.366
