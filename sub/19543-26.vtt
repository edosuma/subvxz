00:02.878 --> 00:08.794
Kuririn received the Dragon Ball
from the Grand Elder.

00:08.884 --> 00:11.296
Gohan also went into action,

00:11.387 --> 00:15.096
to procure the one that Vegeta had hidden.

00:17.559 --> 00:21.017
Elsewhere, Freeza, who held the remaining five,

00:21.105 --> 00:23.972
had captured Vegeta!

"The Scheme is Shattered!
Vegeta Strikes Back at Zarbon. ”

02:06.376 --> 02:08.366
You've taken quite a bit of damage.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.249
This could take a while.

02:11.340 --> 02:14.628
Come on. If you don't regain consciousness,

02:14.718 --> 02:18.836
I'm the one that Freeza is gonna take it out on.

02:18.931 --> 02:24.847
That should do it. Now | just
have to wait until you wake up.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.280 --> 02:37.487
How is Vegeta?

02:37.574 --> 02:41.032
Sir, he should be regaining
consciousness shortly.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.155
That is good, is it not?

02:43.247 --> 02:45.613
Y-Yes, sir.

02:47.960 --> 02:51.373
W-What was that explosion?!

02:51.463 --> 02:53.169
It cannot be...!

03:00.889 --> 03:04.723
Looks like you underestimated
my recuperative ability.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.386
Now then...

03:13.026 --> 03:15.358
Damn! It came from the
treatment room, all right!

03:15.445 --> 03:17.572
Zarbon-san, quickly!

03:22.160 --> 03:24.321
Oh, no! He fled outside!

03:24.413 --> 03:25.744
He did what?!

03:25.831 --> 03:28.368
Good! Freeza is with him!

03:28.458 --> 03:30.790
Quickly! Quickly, go after him!

03:30.878 --> 03:32.664
W-Why, you...!

03:32.754 --> 03:38.590
Quickly! Find him no matter what!
He could not have gotten very far!

03:38.677 --> 03:42.135
Fools. You fell for that all too easily.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.066
Dear Freeza-sama,

03:57.154 --> 04:01.113
Right now, as of this moment,
your reign is at an end.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.441
Your beloved Vegeta.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.786
I win!

04:24.514 --> 04:27.301
Let's see...

04:27.392 --> 04:29.474
It's around here.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.666
H-How awful.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.798
I'm sure Vegeta must have done this.

05:03.804 --> 05:07.012
Where are you? Where are you?!

05:07.099 --> 05:09.590
Where did you run off to, Vegeta?!

05:09.685 --> 05:12.267
He couldn't have gotten away that quickly.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.219
He must be hiding somewhere.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.681
You still have not found him, Zarbon-san?!

05:20.821 --> 05:23.563
If you have the nerve to allow him
to get away from you like this,

05:23.657 --> 05:27.445
you will die to take responsibility.

05:29.997 --> 05:34.741
Fool! Keep searching around outside all you like!

05:34.835 --> 05:37.793
One... two... three... four...

05:37.879 --> 05:40.131
All five of them are here, all right.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.706
They didn't just heal my injuries,

05:42.801 --> 05:44.917
they're going to have every
last one of their Dragon Balls

05:45.012 --> 05:47.298
stolen by me, as well.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.723
But I can't get away cleanly
carrying all five of them.

05:51.810 --> 05:56.850
What's more, I don't have much time to think.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.521
All right...

06:14.374 --> 06:18.367
Please, let this work!

06:18.462 --> 06:22.000
Hey! You fell for it! I'm still inside the ship!

06:22.090 --> 06:24.376
--Wha...?
--He's what?!

06:39.316 --> 06:41.932
D-Damn him!

06:50.410 --> 06:52.116
Now!

06:59.461 --> 07:02.373
Where is Vegeta?!

07:06.009 --> 07:10.878
D-Do not tell me that Vegeta
is after the Dragon Balls!

07:23.151 --> 07:25.688
All right! Now for me!

07:28.698 --> 07:31.110
T-The Dragon Balls!

07:31.201 --> 07:35.069
T-That bastard!

07:38.500 --> 07:41.242
W-Where is he this time?!

07:52.013 --> 07:57.178
F-Freeza-sama, could he
still be inside the spaceship?

07:57.269 --> 07:59.055
Find him!

07:59.146 --> 08:00.852
Y-Yes, sir!

08:05.735 --> 08:07.396
[H were to foolishly flee by air,

08:07.487 --> 08:11.400
Freeza would catch up to me in no time.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.703
What a disgrace!

08:26.798 --> 08:31.633
Not only did you let Vegeta escape,
but he has the Dragon Balls, too!

08:31.720 --> 08:36.009
There is no way he could have escaped
in a flash carrying all five Dragon Balls!

08:36.099 --> 08:38.556
I shall search inside the spaceship.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.179
You will thoroughly look around outside!

08:41.270 --> 08:44.058
--Yes, sir.
--I trust you are ready to answer for this.

08:44.149 --> 08:49.360
If one hour passes, and you are
unable to bring Vegeta back here...

08:52.073 --> 08:53.938
Y-Yes, sir...

09:05.962 --> 09:08.339
Huh? This way?

09:08.423 --> 09:10.835
Not inside one of the houses?

09:14.221 --> 09:19.432
| get it! Not even Vegeta would
have found it inside the lake.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.081
I did it!

09:50.882 --> 09:53.123
Here it is, here it is!

10:15.490 --> 10:18.778
I'm sure they must have
landed around here somewhere.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.328
There they are! There they are!

10:27.419 --> 10:30.206
Outstanding control, if I do say so myself!

10:30.297 --> 10:32.879
Take that, Freeza!

10:34.217 --> 10:38.130
I've finally gotten his Dragon Balls!

10:40.015 --> 10:42.757
Now, if you include the one | sunk by that village,

10:42.851 --> 10:47.515
| only need one more to have all seven!

10:47.605 --> 10:51.268
There's a strong battle power...! Is that Zarbon?!

10:51.359 --> 10:55.022
No, it's not. The battle power
is lower than Zarbon's.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.363
l-ls that...?

11:02.746 --> 11:05.954
Just you wait, Gohan! Once you
go to the Grand Elder's place,

11:06.041 --> 11:09.499
you'll become much, much stronger!

11:13.214 --> 11:15.591
It's that earthling!

11:15.675 --> 11:18.417
W-What's he doing on Planet Namek?

11:18.511 --> 11:21.924
What's more, he was
carrying the last Dragon Ball.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.975
Luck is on my side from top to bottom!

11:50.293 --> 11:53.035
That was fast! I'm almost there!

11:54.631 --> 11:57.964
It looks like that earthling is
after the Dragon Balls, too.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.669
But I will be taking the one you're carrying!

12:03.181 --> 12:07.345
Now I'll have all seven of the Dragon Balls!

12:07.435 --> 12:12.600
D-Damn it, Vegeta! Where are you?!

12:12.690 --> 12:16.603
If only I had a Scouter,
it would be easy to find you!

12:23.660 --> 12:28.074
The way things are going, my life
will be forfeit to Freeza-sama.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.575
Is that Vegeta?!

12:33.670 --> 12:38.881
No. That's the guy who came to
the rescue of that Namekian kid.

12:38.967 --> 12:42.300
But he's carrying what looks like a Dragon Ball.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.512
Vegeta!

12:46.599 --> 12:50.683
I've found you at last! You're all mine now!

13:11.082 --> 13:13.869
There's a tremendous battle power following me.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.497
Looks like Zarbon found me.

13:16.588 --> 13:19.045
Tch, what a pesky bastard.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.875
Still, this is a good opportunity.
I'll put him away for sure this time.

13:22.969 --> 13:28.589
He's completely heartened by
our last battle. He'll be off guard.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.111
Huh?

13:46.409 --> 13:49.151
It's you, Kuririn-kun! Don't startle me!

13:49.245 --> 13:51.861
T-This is dangerous, isn't it, Bulma-san?

13:51.956 --> 13:53.912
If you stay outside,
casually reading a book like that,

13:54.000 --> 13:55.786
they're going to spot you.

13:55.877 --> 14:00.462
What are you talking about?! If I stay
inside the cave the whole time...

14:00.548 --> 14:04.837
l-ls that, by any chance, a Dragon Ball?

14:04.928 --> 14:06.793
Bingo!

14:07.972 --> 14:12.432
The home-soil Dragon Balls are huge, aren't they?

14:12.519 --> 14:16.262
The Grand Elder was quite reasonable.

14:16.356 --> 14:20.395
Oh, right, right! Bulma-san,
is Gohan inside the house?

14:20.485 --> 14:24.478
I want to take him to see the Grand Elder, too.

14:24.572 --> 14:27.939
He went to go find another Dragon Ball.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.490
It showed up on the Radar.

14:29.577 --> 14:33.616
Near that village that
Vegeta attacked, remember?

14:33.706 --> 14:36.243
ReaHy?

14:36.334 --> 14:40.168
A-A Ki! It's headed this way, and it's almost here!

14:40.255 --> 14:42.496
It's Gohan-kun! That was fast, huh?

14:42.590 --> 14:44.922
No, it's not Gohan!

14:46.761 --> 14:49.173
V-Veg eta!

14:57.605 --> 15:00.221
Crap! I was so carried away
with becoming stronger,

15:00.316 --> 15:02.807
I didn't notice his Ki!

15:02.902 --> 15:06.611
I wouldn't have expected to
meet you here, earthlings.

15:06.698 --> 15:09.440
I didn't think you had the technology it took

15:09.534 --> 15:11.525
to travel to this planet.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.201
Judging by the Dragon Ball
you're so delicately holding,

15:14.289 --> 15:17.531
it would seem that we have the same objective.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.167
Listen up. Before I take that Ball from you,

15:21.254 --> 15:24.087
there's something I have to do.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.710
But you'd better not get any funny ideas,

15:26.801 --> 15:28.962
like taking that and running away with it.

15:29.053 --> 15:32.216
It won't be just you that dies,
but the woman, as well.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.799
So, you're here.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.858
W-Who is that guy? Judging from his face,

15:48.948 --> 15:51.280
I wonder if he isn't our knight in shining armor.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.574
N-No way...

16:09.636 --> 16:11.342
T-This is as bad as it gets!

16:11.429 --> 16:16.298
What's as bad as it gets? He's a
pretty fine-looking man, isn't he?

16:16.392 --> 16:19.884
Please don't go judging people by
their appearances at a time like this!

16:19.979 --> 16:22.891
But usually, the hunk is the good guy.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.314
This is not Earth, it's Planet Namek.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.892
I know that.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.150
Bulma-san, you don't understand anything.

16:38.373 --> 16:43.413
You've done quite a job
of mocking me, Vegeta-san.

16:43.503 --> 16:48.964
| see. I also recognize that little
runt holding the Dragon Ball.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.881
You guys are together, are you?

16:53.971 --> 16:55.006
Yoo-hoo!

16:55.098 --> 16:58.682
Yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo!
Stick it to Vegeta, okay?

16:58.768 --> 17:01.009
Hmph, yeah, right.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.641
It doesn't matter to me.

17:03.731 --> 17:08.191
Vegeta, where did you hide
the remaining Dragon Ball?

17:08.277 --> 17:12.145
I'm going to bring you before
Freeza-sama, and make you tell us.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.946
Just try it.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.990
You'll never learn.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.627
Don't you mess with me!

17:45.690 --> 17:46.930
If this keeps up...

17:47.024 --> 17:49.982
Hmph, you're finally getting into it, huh?

18:12.258 --> 18:14.214
He's a bad guy, all right!

18:14.302 --> 18:16.884
W-What is this?! He turned into a monster!

18:16.971 --> 18:19.633
And what's more, his power shot up like crazy!

18:26.606 --> 18:28.688
You fell for it, Zarbon!

18:39.243 --> 18:41.108
Damn it!

18:59.806 --> 19:02.843
Bulma-san, now's our chance!
Let's get out of here!

19:02.934 --> 19:05.596
But he said he'd kill us if we ran!

19:05.686 --> 19:08.678
We'll be killed if we don't run! Hurry!

19:08.773 --> 19:10.684
Oh, no you don't!

19:15.196 --> 19:18.279
Damn! Nothing gets past him!

19:21.369 --> 19:22.984
l'm sensing two incredible Ki!

19:23.079 --> 19:25.195
They're coming from where
Bulma-san is waiting for me!

19:32.213 --> 19:36.206
Vegeta, how dare you...?

19:36.300 --> 19:37.961
Looks like that took quite a toll.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.794
Your strength has dropped
considerably, hasn't it?

19:40.888 --> 19:44.426
Zarbon-san, your death
would appear to be at hand.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.304
My death is near?

19:47.395 --> 19:51.354
Don't make me laugh! My battle
power is higher than yours!

19:51.440 --> 19:54.227
Zarbon-san, I thought you were supposed to be

19:54.318 --> 19:57.310
well acquainted with Saiyans, weren't you?

19:59.031 --> 20:01.818
You were wrong to have carelessly treated me

20:01.909 --> 20:05.242
after I came close to dying. Isn't that right?

20:05.329 --> 20:07.536
Every time a Saiyan recovers
after being near death,

20:07.623 --> 20:11.707
they are able to rapidly raise their battle power.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.375
So that's it. Come to think of it,

20:13.462 --> 20:17.330
Goku also got stronger after each intense battle.

20:17.425 --> 20:21.885
Damn, so that's why
Vegeta's Ki rose so much, is it?

20:21.971 --> 20:24.633
I don't care how much you've
raised your battle power,

20:24.724 --> 20:26.589
there's no way you can beat
me when I'm transformed,

20:26.684 --> 20:29.300
and am able to exhibit my true power!

20:31.731 --> 20:35.565
The Saiyans are a warrior race!
Don't mess with us!

21:01.886 --> 21:07.301
V-Vegeta... H was just
following Freeza-sama's orders...

21:07.391 --> 21:09.973
Let me go... p-please...

21:10.061 --> 21:12.598
After all the time you've
spent pushing me around,

21:12.688 --> 21:14.804
don't you dare go asking anything for yourself!

21:14.899 --> 21:17.641
|-| know... Let's team up together...

21:17.735 --> 21:21.569
If we do that, we could beat even Freeza...!

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yaburekabure omoikiri

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Tobu n da mugen no sora e

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101

I've got a little over two days
before I arrive on Planet Namek.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.265
Guys, stay safe!

22:41.360 --> 22:44.318
Damn, after I finally got
one of the Dragon Balls...!

22:44.405 --> 22:47.112
Gohan, at this point,
you're the only hope we've got.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.781
Come on back here without anyone seeing you!

22:49.869 --> 22:51.734
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:51.829 --> 22:55.868
"A Touch-and-go Pinch!
Gohan, Protect the Si Xing Qiu Ball. ”

22:55.958 --> 22:59.291
Let's run away for now, and wait for our chance!
