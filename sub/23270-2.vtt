00:05.005 --> 00:08.049
[pulsing music]

00:10.885 --> 00:13.680
[narrator]  Around the world,
food allergies are surging

00:13.763 --> 00:16.182
to near-epidemic levels.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.518
[man]  A molecule of peanut protein,

00:18.601 --> 00:21.312
a molecule of shellfish protein
could cause a reaction.

00:21.646 --> 00:23.481
Any meal could be my last, I guess!

00:24.357 --> 00:25.984
[narrator]  Victims are often children,

00:26.067 --> 00:28.945
and even their parents
can be powerless to help.

00:29.779 --> 00:32.073
We had to take him
to Lurie Children's Hospital.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.950
His face was swollen.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.327
His eyes were turning
a different, dark color of red.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.623
[narrator]
Restaurants have become battlegrounds.

00:41.124 --> 00:44.085
[Ming Tsai] We bend over backwards
to ensure our food is safe.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.588
Bend over backwards,
because it's life and death.

00:47.338 --> 00:50.550
[narrator]  Food allergies are no myth.
And they can kill.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.928
He had only eaten a mouthful
of the meal that he'd ordered.

00:54.012 --> 00:57.182
We had done what we had done
to prevent this happening.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.768
[narrator]  Science is just beginning
to understand

00:59.851 --> 01:03.271
why some people react
to seemingly harmless foods...

01:03.354 --> 01:07.901
We evolved to protect the body
by promoting their active expulsion.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.779
[narrator]  ...and is racing
towards finding a cure.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.698
[woman]  Getting your immune system
to know that this is OK:

01:13.782 --> 01:16.034
that in itself would be incredible.

01:16.618 --> 01:21.039
[sizzling]

01:26.002 --> 01:28.963
[tense orchestral music]

01:53.780 --> 01:56.783
[man] I'll be glad
when you take over.

02:00.036 --> 02:02.580
-Do you know how to pull up peanuts?
-You've shown me.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.001
[man] I don't know about you.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.754
[woman]  Peanuts are
a very interesting crop to grow.

02:10.296 --> 02:11.297
[man] That better?

02:11.381 --> 02:13.174
Mine is better than yours.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.635
Luck. Beginner's luck.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.220
[woman]  I'm learning.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.348
They are actually a legume.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.476
They're nitrogen fixing,

02:23.560 --> 02:28.022
which is a really incredible trait
within a crop rotation, because...

02:28.106 --> 02:29.649
They don't need fertilizer.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.235
You don't fertilize peanuts.
They make their own.

02:33.361 --> 02:34.946
[narrator]  Peanuts are in trouble.

02:35.488 --> 02:39.033
In only a few years, they have seen
their reputation transformed.

02:40.243 --> 02:43.955
For more than a century, peanuts have been
the classic American snack.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.709
Cheap, nutritious, and everywhere.

02:48.418 --> 02:52.714
There's a little crop canopy,
a small, bushy-type crop canopy

02:52.797 --> 02:54.090
above ground,

02:54.173 --> 02:56.634
but the peanuts form
and develop underground.

02:57.343 --> 03:00.096
See this bloom here, this yellow bloom?

03:00.430 --> 03:04.392
This little bloom turns into a peg
which goes into the ground,

03:04.475 --> 03:06.144
that eventually becomes a peanut.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.941
[narrator]  Peanuts are the keystone
of agriculture in southwest Georgia.

03:12.442 --> 03:16.154
Two out of every five peanuts in the US
are grown in Georgia.

03:16.946 --> 03:20.158
The Cox family farms 280 acres of them:

03:20.241 --> 03:23.119
more than one million pounds of peanuts
every year.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.666
[Casey]  My dad is the fifth generation
of his family to farm.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.252
And I decided when I was in college

03:31.336 --> 03:34.088
that I wanted to come back
to southwest Georgia

03:34.172 --> 03:37.133
and eventually take over
our farming operation.

03:37.550 --> 03:41.512
It's something that really matters to me,
and is really special to me.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.640
I feel like it is an honor and a privilege

03:43.723 --> 03:45.725
to have the opportunity
to come back to this farm.

03:46.809 --> 03:50.355
So I just try to spend as much time
as I can with my dad,

03:50.438 --> 03:52.607
listening to him and learning from him,

03:52.690 --> 03:55.985
and eventually,
probably within the next few years,

03:56.069 --> 03:57.528
he'll be ready to retire,

03:57.612 --> 04:02.408
and I'll take more of an ownership
and leadership role in the farm.

04:02.492 --> 04:06.204
I know I have a lot to learn,
and it's gonna take me a while.

04:07.455 --> 04:12.085
My father has been so innovative
and progressive as a farmer,

04:12.168 --> 04:16.256
and I want to continue that tradition
and legacy of innovation

04:16.339 --> 04:17.715
and new opportunities,

04:17.799 --> 04:20.426
and see what happens in my generation.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.014
[narrator]  But the next generation
of this peanut dynasty

04:25.098 --> 04:29.060
will likely face challenges
that the last five never imagined.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.940
The future of this essential harvest
is now in question,

04:34.023 --> 04:37.568
all because of a sweeping surge
in food allergies.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.321
Thirty years ago, it did not exist.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.490
Or if it did, it was not discussed.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.952
It really is something that my generation
is the first to deal with.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.746
The first thing people think of
with peanut production,

04:48.830 --> 04:50.373
people that I've talked to...

04:50.456 --> 04:52.166
The first thing was the allergy.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.460
It's interesting to hear theories

04:54.544 --> 04:57.213
but there's not much information
about where it came from.

04:57.797 --> 05:01.092
So, I'm hoping that the research
and science that is going on

05:01.175 --> 05:04.178
can come up with a solution
and come up with other ways

05:04.262 --> 05:07.974
to maybe prevent this from happening
in the future.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.523
I'm allergic to peanuts, pecans,

05:15.606 --> 05:17.358
pistachios, chestnuts,

05:17.442 --> 05:19.193
walnuts, Brazil nuts...

05:19.277 --> 05:22.739
I was deathly allergic to wheat,
rye, oats, and barley, growing up.

05:22.822 --> 05:27.160
Abbie broke out in hives
and the reaction lasted four days

05:27.243 --> 05:30.038
which, when you are on a cruise boat,
is really unnerving.

05:30.121 --> 05:31.998
When she was three and a half,

05:32.081 --> 05:35.835
we had an emergency landing on a flight
because of exposure to peanut dust.

05:35.918 --> 05:38.212
I started to have a secondary reaction,

05:38.296 --> 05:39.756
which is when...

05:40.882 --> 05:43.926
it caused me to stop breathing,
and I wasn't able to talk.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.889
[narrator]  Something in our world
is changing.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.769
Our bodies are rejecting the food we eat.

05:53.728 --> 05:56.814
Even the experts don't really know why.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.984
When I started looking at food allergy
it was shocking

06:00.068 --> 06:03.279
that we knew so little
about food allergies.

06:03.362 --> 06:08.326
This was 12 years ago. We didn't even know
how many kids had food allergies.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.495
Those numbers were not being collected.

06:11.579 --> 06:15.249
[narrator]  Chicago pediatrician
Ruchi Gupta has spent the last decade

06:15.333 --> 06:16.876
tracking this worldwide trend:

06:18.211 --> 06:21.464
a surge in food allergies,
especially among children.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.550
It was just starting to get noticed.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.469
You started hearing it more and more,

06:26.552 --> 06:29.180
but we didn't understand
the extent of the problem.

06:29.263 --> 06:31.724
I have eggs, peanuts, tree nuts,

06:31.808 --> 06:35.895
fin fish, shellfish,
sesame seeds, and legumes.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.731
We surveyed 40,000 kids
across the United States,

06:38.815 --> 06:44.487
and what we found was that 8% of children
in the United States have a food allergy.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.907
That's about 1 in 13 kids.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.326
Six million in the US.

06:51.661 --> 06:56.082
[narrator]  It amounts to a nearly 50%
increase in the last two decades alone.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.297
There are eight key food allergens

07:03.381 --> 07:07.510
that trigger more than 90%
of all food allergic reactions:

07:08.511 --> 07:11.347
shellfish, tree nut,

07:11.848 --> 07:14.559
egg, milk,

07:14.976 --> 07:17.520
fin fish, soy,

07:18.229 --> 07:19.480
wheat,

07:19.564 --> 07:22.066
and the most prevalent of all
among children:

07:23.568 --> 07:24.569
the peanut.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.823
[sinister guitar music]

07:30.908 --> 07:34.036
[Gupta]  Peanut allergy is the most common
of all food allergens,

07:34.120 --> 07:38.875
so it impacts about one in four kids
with a food allergy.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.586
It's such a pervasive staple.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.671
When children go to school,

07:43.963 --> 07:47.008
they don't take a lunchbox of shellfish.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.135
They take a peanut butter sandwich.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.764
Peanut oil, peanut butter,
peanuts themselves,

07:54.265 --> 07:56.517
they are in almost everything.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.605
[Ruchi Gupta]  Now, the reason peanuts
get the most attention:

08:00.688 --> 08:02.356
not only are they the most common,

08:02.440 --> 08:08.488
but kids who have a peanut allergy tend
to experience severe reactions more often.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.240
-Haven't grown out of them?
-Nope.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.493
Have you had any reactions
in the past year?

08:13.576 --> 08:16.746
I actually had two allergic reactions
over the summer.

08:16.829 --> 08:20.166
I started throwing up.
My stomach started condensing.

08:20.249 --> 08:23.961
I got hives,
little red bumps all over my skin.

08:24.045 --> 08:27.298
And my throat started closing up.
They had to put me on oxygen.

08:27.715 --> 08:31.260
[narrator]  In Gupta's research, more than
half of kids with peanut allergies

08:31.344 --> 08:33.888
have experienced
a life-threatening attack.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.519
The crisis is global.

08:41.020 --> 08:45.441
Most countries that keep count
have seen children's food allergies surge.

08:46.859 --> 08:47.735
In Britain,

08:47.818 --> 08:51.864
the odds that a person with a food allergy
will be hospitalized by the condition

08:51.948 --> 08:55.576
have jumped to three times
what they were 20 years ago.

08:56.994 --> 09:00.915
Nearly two million Brits
are at risk at every meal.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.420
I was meant to be going to a party
with my friends.

09:06.504 --> 09:10.091
I went to my friend's house to get ready,
have something to eat.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.889
My friend suggested
we went for an Indian takeaway.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.934
So, yeah, I liked Indian,
so that was fine.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.147
We all said what we wanted.

09:25.231 --> 09:29.151
I think we all ordered something like
chicken korma or chicken tikka masala.

09:30.194 --> 09:34.031
[narrator]  Among the most popular takeout
foods in England are Indian curries,

09:34.115 --> 09:37.118
many of which call for almonds
or almond powder.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.162
But almonds are expensive.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.873
Some restaurants
use cheaper peanuts instead.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.627
I said, "Oh, I have
a peanut allergy, by the way,

09:46.711 --> 09:50.089
so there can't be any peanuts in my meal."

09:50.172 --> 09:52.091
And the guy behind the counter was like,

09:52.174 --> 09:56.804
"There's no peanuts in a chicken
korma, so it will be fine for you."

10:00.766 --> 10:05.146
I just had, like, a small part
of the sauce on a fork.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.651
My lips started to swell
and get a bit red.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.323
I was getting very hot.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.412
And my lip tingling
just got worse and worse.

10:21.996 --> 10:25.666
And my throat started to feel,
like, very swollen

10:25.750 --> 10:26.834
and, like, tight.

10:29.003 --> 10:32.840
And I came out in hives,
all over my arms, all over my legs.

10:35.384 --> 10:38.804
Only, you know, like,
"Wait. I can't actually breathe here."

10:38.888 --> 10:41.599
[sinister guitar music]

10:45.978 --> 10:48.856
[narrator]  Peanut proteins
had entered Ruby's bloodstream.

10:49.857 --> 10:54.320
There, they were detected by
a defense system called Immunoglobulin E,

10:54.403 --> 10:55.863
or IgE.

10:56.572 --> 10:59.283
[Ruchi Gupta]  You can have an IgE
specific to something.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.036
That's why some people are
only allergic to cat dander,

11:02.119 --> 11:04.121
or some are only allergic to peanuts.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.540
It's almost like a watchdog.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.292
It's sitting out there, watching

11:08.376 --> 11:14.173
and thinking of the peanut,
or any food specific,

11:14.256 --> 11:15.299
as an invader.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.176
It's coming in to hurt the body,

11:17.259 --> 11:21.222
and that's why the immune system
is a little bit messed up,

11:21.305 --> 11:25.601
because it should not be attacking
these natural things in our environment.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.853
But it does.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.272
[narrator]  The worst outcome
is anaphylaxis:

11:30.898 --> 11:35.111
a swift, violent attempt by the body
to eject an invader.

11:36.362 --> 11:40.491
Anaphylaxis is a term used to describe

11:40.574 --> 11:44.620
kind of a severe allergic reaction
that's rapid in onset.

11:44.703 --> 11:47.415
A lot of times you'll hear,
"I feel my throat closing,"

11:47.498 --> 11:49.125
or "tightening" or "itching."

11:49.208 --> 11:51.001
Lungs are a big one.

11:51.085 --> 11:54.713
You get wheezing, difficulty breathing,
tightening of the chest.

11:55.256 --> 11:58.008
It can impact your gut.
This is very common.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.387
So you'll have vomiting,
often profuse vomiting.

12:01.846 --> 12:05.015
It results in suppression of heart rate,

12:05.099 --> 12:08.602
drop in blood pressure, and bronchospasm.

12:09.019 --> 12:11.856
Bronchospasm is the one
that's particularly dangerous.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.732
It's difficulty of breathing.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.323
[narrator]  Ruby's mom got a call.

12:21.699 --> 12:25.661
Ruby's friend's dad explained
that Ruby had had a reaction

12:25.744 --> 12:28.622
to a curry that she'd had.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.916
He said, "She just wants
to go to hospital."

12:31.000 --> 12:34.795
I said, "Fine. Just take her straight away
and I will meet you there."

12:37.173 --> 12:40.217
[soft music]

12:45.639 --> 12:47.558
I walked in and I was looking for her,

12:47.641 --> 12:50.811
and all I saw was this girl
stood in front of me,

12:50.895 --> 12:52.146
which I felt so sorry for.

12:52.229 --> 12:55.816
She was absolutely covered
in these purple hives,

12:56.400 --> 12:59.361
which looked extremely painful.

13:00.571 --> 13:04.825
And when she turned around,
I realized it was my daughter.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.995
We both started crying, and I was like,

13:08.078 --> 13:11.165
just grabbed her and said,
"It will be fine, it will be fine."

13:11.957 --> 13:14.001
We got in to see the doctor

13:14.502 --> 13:16.295
and he knew how serious it was.

13:16.712 --> 13:21.300
The only way we know how to deal with it,
other than avoiding exposure to allergens,

13:21.383 --> 13:25.221
is by reversing that reaction
by using epinephrine.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.557
[narrator]  Epinephrine,
also known as adrenaline,

13:28.641 --> 13:31.977
is a hormone easily administered
through an auto-injector.

13:33.395 --> 13:38.108
It's powerful stuff,
and each use requires hospitalization.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.237
[Ruby Scott] After he used the EpiPen,

13:41.320 --> 13:44.740
I just laid down for a bit
in the treatment room,

13:45.366 --> 13:48.202
and my symptoms started to go.

13:48.285 --> 13:51.413
It actually relaxes the muscles
around your lungs,

13:51.497 --> 13:52.790
so it's easier to breathe.

13:52.873 --> 13:55.834
And that's life-saving,
under these conditions.

13:59.380 --> 14:04.134
I had the hives for about
three or four days afterwards.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.220
And I just felt very weak.

14:07.805 --> 14:11.058
[Marianne Scott]  We had been told
that each time she has one,

14:11.141 --> 14:12.560
they get worse.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.813
And you just dread
what might happen next time.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.776
[narrator]  Trading Standards
is the UK agency

14:20.860 --> 14:22.862
that monitors restaurant conditions.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.824
Once Ruby had recovered,
Marianne Scott called the agency

14:27.324 --> 14:29.243
to report what had happened.

14:29.326 --> 14:32.955
Maybe the restaurant wasn't aware
that there was peanuts in.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.165
So we wanted to make it aware,

14:35.249 --> 14:37.918
so this didn't ever happen again
to someone.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.045
I was adamant there was peanuts in it,

14:40.129 --> 14:44.758
and I wanted them to see if there was
peanuts being used in their meals.

14:45.342 --> 14:49.221
[narrator]  The restaurant
where Ruby had ordered was Jaipur Spice.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.227
A Trading Standards officer went in,
made a test purchase,

14:55.311 --> 15:00.274
specified that they had to have
a meal that was nut-free,

15:00.357 --> 15:03.152
were assured that the meal was nut-free.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.280
The meal was full of peanut.
Enough peanut to kill.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.867
[narrator]  Jaipur Spice
was issued a warning.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.329
They had informed the owner,

15:13.412 --> 15:16.165
and told them
what had happened to my daughter,

15:16.916 --> 15:20.377
and how they could
prevent it happening to anybody else.

15:24.840 --> 15:29.386
[narrator]  Food allergies have made
the dinner table a high-risk environment.

15:29.470 --> 15:34.475
And it's chefs who are forced to navigate
that minefield every day and every night.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.227
I don't remember...

15:37.686 --> 15:41.565
I don't remember it ever being a thing,
you know, 20 years ago.

15:41.649 --> 15:42.900
Someone...

15:42.983 --> 15:46.236
I know people have been
deathly allergic to peanuts forever.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.906
I just don't remember it being...

15:49.490 --> 15:52.159
as part of a service as it is these days.

15:52.534 --> 15:56.538
There weren't nearly as many allergies,
20 years ago, so there's that.

15:56.622 --> 16:00.084
It was rare when you got
a peanut allergy or soy allergy,

16:00.167 --> 16:02.169
so there didn't seem to be a need.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.715
[narrator]  But today's restaurant world
has been radically changed by allergies.

16:07.758 --> 16:12.888
Ming Tsai was one of the first chefs
to embrace clientele with this condition.

16:13.305 --> 16:17.267
I've probably witnessed
20 crying mothers in my restaurant,

16:17.351 --> 16:19.103
at Blue Ginger, because it's older,

16:19.895 --> 16:23.816
and I've spent time at the table and I go
over and say, "Is everything alright?"

16:23.899 --> 16:27.236
She's like, "My son has
never been out to a restaurant."

16:27.319 --> 16:30.739
He's 12, he's 13, he's 11, he's 8.
"Look how happy he is."

16:31.031 --> 16:33.367
[staccato music]

16:36.161 --> 16:39.123
I can't think of a more fundamental thing
of a restaurant,

16:39.206 --> 16:41.458
of the baseline you have to do,

16:41.542 --> 16:45.421
which is clean water to drink
and safe food to eat.

16:45.504 --> 16:49.633
Everything else: the music, awesome,
but if music isn't playing, it's OK.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.677
Buy a CD player.
That's not gonna kill someone.

16:52.136 --> 16:56.640
But if you don't know what's in your food,
get out of the business. Today.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.143
There's, like, certain things
you stay away from,

16:59.226 --> 17:01.562
and certain kinds of restaurants
you stay away from.

17:01.645 --> 17:04.982
You can tell immediately if the waiter
or waitress has been trained.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.359
We always get down
to the exact food she wants,

17:07.443 --> 17:10.070
because it doesn't matter
what the restaurant does.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.072
It matters if that macaroni is safe.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.825
Sometimes they will start
to talk about peanuts,

17:14.908 --> 17:17.786
and I have to say,
"No, my kids aren't allergic to peanuts.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.080
They're only allergic to tree nuts.

17:20.164 --> 17:24.585
They come back to the table
and they say, "You should be OK."

17:24.877 --> 17:29.506
It should be, like,
"You will be OK. You are OK. It's safe."

17:32.217 --> 17:36.680
[Ming Tsai]  We have, on a Saturday night,
15 allergen tables a night.

17:36.764 --> 17:37.806
I mean, a lot.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.852
Enough that it could, if you didn't have
a system, ruin your service.

17:41.935 --> 17:45.314
And now, you ruin service
for 85, 150 other people.

17:48.650 --> 17:52.196
[narrator]  When he opened his first
restaurant, Ming created a food bible,

17:52.279 --> 17:57.326
showing a complete list of the ingredients
that go into every item on the menu.

17:57.409 --> 18:00.913
I took an Excel spreadsheet,
which is just boxes,

18:00.996 --> 18:03.624
and it's just the eight allergens
that are key:

18:03.707 --> 18:06.919
soy, wheat, dairy, shellfish, peanuts,
tree nuts, eggs, and fish.

18:07.377 --> 18:09.671
Those are the eight ones
that are up top in a box,

18:09.755 --> 18:12.883
and then we just highlight
that this dish has four of those eight.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.969
So it's crystal clear when you look
in the beef and potatoes,

18:16.053 --> 18:18.138
there are four allergens, the common ones.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.517
Literally, everyone thinks
this is a hard thing to do.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.435
It's just a spreadsheet.

18:24.520 --> 18:28.232
We got it. It's a shorty.
"Severe shellfish allergy."

18:28.315 --> 18:30.526
We gotta use clean tongs, clean spoons.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.070
Alright. Here it is, you guys...

18:33.153 --> 18:37.074
[Ming Tsai]  So the sous-chef pulls
the ticket, the waiter will highlight it.

18:37.157 --> 18:38.158
I initial it,

18:38.242 --> 18:41.328
so we have a check and balance
that I physically checked it.

18:41.411 --> 18:44.248
Even on a Saturday night, I have to.
This is life and death.

18:45.374 --> 18:49.461
OK, guys, we've got a smashed cucumber.
Egg, soy, and gluten allergy.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.463
So, no white soy.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.882
[Sam Mason]  The wait staff
is the first line of defense.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.302
They are the liaison
between you and this human being

18:57.386 --> 19:01.306
whose face will swell up if they...
you know, if they eat a crustacean.

19:02.307 --> 19:06.061
[woman]  At any one time, I probably
have 25 to 30 people in my section.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.521
It matters.

19:07.604 --> 19:10.691
Everything that I'm doing,
I have to stop, pay attention,

19:10.774 --> 19:14.361
ring in the allergy correctly,
double-check correctly with the chefs.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.573
[narrator]  Sara frequently deals
with anxious parents

19:17.656 --> 19:19.366
ordering for allergic children.

19:19.449 --> 19:22.369
[Sara]  The mom's concern was apparent.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.997
She was, like, nervous,

19:25.080 --> 19:28.584
and did not really trust
what was going on here.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.878
So in order to gain her trust,

19:30.961 --> 19:33.380
I talked to her about my knowledge
and what I knew

19:33.463 --> 19:36.091
about the allergy that she conveyed to me.

19:36.175 --> 19:40.512
And I took a picture of the product
and ingredients, and brought it to her.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.849
So I started to show her the ingredients
and products we were using,

19:43.932 --> 19:46.435
just in an effort to make her
feel more comfortable.

19:46.518 --> 19:49.396
I already know and am confident
in what we do here,

19:49.479 --> 19:52.441
and that we were going
to protect her child and not hurt her.

19:52.524 --> 19:53.692
But I wanted her to know.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.653
I feel like having a food allergy

19:56.737 --> 19:59.072
would be the most expensive way
to eat out, ever.

19:59.156 --> 20:03.368
I would give every waiter
that didn't kill me an extra 50 bucks!

20:03.452 --> 20:05.495
"For you. Thank you for not killing me."

20:06.580 --> 20:10.125
[narrator]  The costs fall on kitchens
more often than customers,

20:10.209 --> 20:12.544
but some chefs see it as an investment.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.505
[Ming Tsai]  Everybody's money is good:

20:15.589 --> 20:17.966
people with allergies
and without allergies.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.969
If I have a food allergy
and I'm going out to dinner with friends--

20:21.053 --> 20:22.554
The four top--

20:22.638 --> 20:25.265
We're going to go to the restaurant
I feel safest at,

20:25.349 --> 20:27.100
that hopefully has delicious food.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.982
Allergy people talk to each other a lot.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.693
And if you get it,
the word of mouth gets out there.

20:37.277 --> 20:42.783
And the amount of repeat business you get
from an allergen table is incredible.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.661
[chef] We've a shrimp
and a chicken, Table 1.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.955
The other shumai is Table 3.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.959
[narrator]  In an industry
of hairline profit margins

20:52.042 --> 20:55.879
there are very real costs
to accommodating food allergies.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.216
Consider the impact of the prep cook
on the bottom line.

20:59.549 --> 21:02.010
[Sam Mason]  If he's by himself
and he has to run downstairs

21:02.094 --> 21:06.932
to make a small amount of...
let's say it's a dressing for a salad...

21:07.724 --> 21:11.728
no other cold app or salad
is getting plated while he's gone.

21:12.187 --> 21:14.982
So that person, in five minutes,

21:15.065 --> 21:18.068
probably could have picked up
15 other plates,

21:18.151 --> 21:19.987
and those plates are still empty.

21:20.612 --> 21:24.866
You know, when turn times are so fast
and you're a very busy restaurant,

21:24.950 --> 21:26.785
that translates to money.

21:26.868 --> 21:30.247
That is... That's American currency
that's not coming your way.

21:30.330 --> 21:33.792
[chef] Chicken dumpling for Table 312.
Safe for shellfish.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.461
[narrator]  And there's also the cost
of allergy claims,

21:36.545 --> 21:38.463
that are occasionally bogus.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.426
If one of the Kardashians
is gluten-intolerant,

21:42.509 --> 21:45.178
there's a good chance
you might get a group of people

21:45.262 --> 21:48.098
who are, all of a sudden,
gluten-intolerant as well!

21:48.598 --> 21:50.350
That's just the way it's going to be.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.228
It's a dairy allergy or a wheat allergy.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.106
Then we see them eating a cookie
with dessert.

21:56.189 --> 21:59.568
"We thought you had a wheat allergy."
"Oh, no, I'm just on a diet."

21:59.651 --> 22:04.197
Well, that is so different than,
"You can die from eating something."

22:06.450 --> 22:10.454
[Sam Mason]  There was a lady at Tailor
once, and I remember this vividly.

22:10.954 --> 22:13.832
She was allergic to large-chopped nuts.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.626
I guess that's not really a nut allergy.

22:16.710 --> 22:20.047
It was the size of the nuts
that she was "allergic" to, quote-unquote.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.173
Which is just absurd.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.718
And that is just so unfair,

22:24.801 --> 22:27.429
because what that does is,
it pisses off chefs,

22:27.512 --> 22:29.264
and they're like, "You know what?"

22:29.347 --> 22:32.768
At one point they're gonna be, like,
"Forget it. It's another fake one."

22:32.851 --> 22:36.063
But that one is going to be real,
and someone is going to get hurt.

22:41.651 --> 22:42.778
[narrator]  In Yorkshire,

22:42.861 --> 22:47.074
three weeks after Ruby Scott's close call
with the peanut-laced curry,

22:47.157 --> 22:49.785
another local, 38-year-old Paul Wilson,

22:50.494 --> 22:52.412
stopped into the pub for a pint.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.292
And he just started drinking in here.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.837
And just chatting away.
A very popular gentleman.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.259
He liked it in here because of the music.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.386
We played '60s and '70s music
on the jukebox.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.932
[man] He used to always
go next-door for a pizza.

23:13.809 --> 23:17.729
-But obviously, this time...
-[Paul] He decided to go for an Indian.

23:18.855 --> 23:22.359
[narrator]  Wilson went to the nearby
Indian Garden restaurant

23:22.442 --> 23:24.277
and ordered a nut-free curry.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.365
Then Brad took him home.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.534
Simple as that. That's how it was.

23:31.701 --> 23:34.329
Then I was just chatting away to him
on the way home,

23:34.663 --> 23:36.331
you know, just general chit-chat.

23:38.667 --> 23:42.045
And I waited while he got in the house,
put the lights on,

23:43.004 --> 23:44.631
and then I drove off.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.931
He had barely started to eat the meal

23:53.014 --> 23:56.935
when he must have realized he was
developing a severe allergic reaction.

23:57.018 --> 23:59.896
People manage their allergies
in different ways.

24:00.230 --> 24:04.276
His way of managing it was to go
to the toilet and make himself sick.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.698
[man]  The ambulance service
received a 999 call

24:09.781 --> 24:12.159
from Mr. Wilson's flatmate,

24:12.242 --> 24:14.452
above the Oak Tree pub, in Helperby,

24:14.536 --> 24:16.538
where he worked in the restaurant.

24:16.621 --> 24:21.251
When the police officers arrived there was
an Indian takeaway meal on the table.

24:22.085 --> 24:24.337
It was set out.
There was some cutlery there.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.882
There was a fork on the plate,

24:26.965 --> 24:30.343
as if someone had had a mouthful
from that meal.

24:31.803 --> 24:34.806
There was a massive reaction to it
from Paul,

24:35.390 --> 24:37.184
and the reaction was so severe,

24:37.267 --> 24:39.686
he collapsed and died
on his bathroom floor.

24:42.397 --> 24:45.609
Paul Wilson developed an allergy
as a child,

24:45.692 --> 24:48.945
when he ate a chocolate bar
that contained peanuts.

24:49.404 --> 24:52.240
He went himself
into the catering industry,

24:52.324 --> 24:54.993
became a chef, and worked in hospitality.

24:55.452 --> 24:58.997
So he was acutely aware
of the dangers of allergies,

24:59.080 --> 25:01.333
and the need to handle food safely.

25:04.127 --> 25:07.881
[narrator]  The two restaurants that had
sickened Ruby Scott and Paul Wilson

25:07.964 --> 25:09.966
were both owned by the same man:

25:10.634 --> 25:11.968
Mohammed Zaman.

25:13.178 --> 25:18.600
Police began an investigation
into Wilson's death and Zaman's kitchens.

25:19.100 --> 25:23.146
[tense music]

25:24.314 --> 25:27.067
They sent samples
from Paul Wilson's final meal

25:27.150 --> 25:28.526
to a laboratory for testing.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.996
[man]
We received in sealed evidence bags,

25:40.080 --> 25:43.792
the food that Paul Wilson had purchased
that day, on the day of his death,

25:44.209 --> 25:46.962
and also, from the pathologist,

25:47.545 --> 25:49.798
Mr. Wilson's stomach contents.

25:52.842 --> 25:56.554
We take a certain... a small weight
of the sample that we've prepared,

25:57.097 --> 26:00.183
and that's shaken with a solution
to extract the peanut protein

26:00.850 --> 26:02.435
from the solid food.

26:05.689 --> 26:08.984
Extracts from the food
are pipetted into tiny test tubes.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.612
They are then incubated
for the reaction to occur,

26:12.696 --> 26:17.117
and the color that's produced during
that reaction is read in a plate reader.

26:21.538 --> 26:25.333
The sauce of the chicken tikka masala
contained very high amounts of peanut.

26:25.417 --> 26:29.254
In fact, 19% of the sauce of
the chicken tikka masala was peanut.

26:30.338 --> 26:34.009
He may have simply licked a spoon,
which he had used to...

26:35.135 --> 26:37.971
take the meal from its containers
onto a plate.

26:38.054 --> 26:41.349
There was certainly enough peanut
in the sauce of the tikka masala

26:41.433 --> 26:44.686
for a teaspoonful of it
to cause his death.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.902
[narrator]  Next,
investigators shifted their focus

26:52.986 --> 26:54.904
to the Indian Garden restaurant.

26:56.406 --> 26:59.701
[Andrew Palmer]  The CCTV showed
a male come into the restaurant

26:59.784 --> 27:02.287
who I understood to be Paul Wilson.

27:03.121 --> 27:07.125
He stood at the counter,
appeared to order a meal.

27:09.294 --> 27:13.048
The order was written down
on an order slip that went to the kitchen.

27:13.423 --> 27:17.093
And that order slip had written on it
clearly, "No nuts."

27:17.719 --> 27:20.972
We retrieved from the bin
at Paul Wilson's house

27:21.056 --> 27:25.393
the lid of the container,
that also read "no nuts."

27:28.563 --> 27:31.691
[Andrew Palmer]  While we were
in the restaurant, Mr. Zaman arrived.

27:32.150 --> 27:35.612
I do remember feeling
sort of slightly uncomfortable

27:35.695 --> 27:38.156
by some of the things that he was saying.

27:38.948 --> 27:41.201
He just seemed to contradict himself.

27:43.286 --> 27:46.581
Personally speaking, it didn't seem
like a truthful account.

27:49.084 --> 27:52.128
[narrator]  Zaman ran
a minor restaurant empire.

27:52.212 --> 27:55.048
As his business grew, so did his debts.

27:56.091 --> 28:00.178
It would appear that Mr. Zaman borrowed
a lot of money against the restaurants.

28:01.179 --> 28:04.182
So that's what we put forward
as a potential motivation

28:04.265 --> 28:07.143
for changing from almond to peanut.

28:07.811 --> 28:10.814
He had a meeting
with one of his suppliers,

28:10.897 --> 28:15.276
and he asked the supplier
if there was a cheaper alternative

28:15.360 --> 28:19.406
to serving almond in his curries.

28:20.865 --> 28:24.494
[Andrew Palmer]  When Mr. Zaman swapped
from almond to peanut,

28:24.577 --> 28:29.082
they warned him of the potential
allergy risks to his customers.

28:29.165 --> 28:32.627
Mr. Zaman claimed
that he didn't get that warning.

28:34.337 --> 28:38.216
[narrator]  Zaman ignored
both his supplier and Trading Standards.

28:38.299 --> 28:41.720
And just three weeks after his food
put Ruby Scott in the hospital,

28:42.303 --> 28:46.057
a meal from Zaman's restaurant
killed Paul Wilson.

28:47.225 --> 28:51.479
Marianne learned the news while continuing
conversations with the inspectors.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.773
I think it was the third time
when they came,

28:54.524 --> 28:59.195
and they explained to us
that somebody else had...

28:59.571 --> 29:02.240
eaten one of the curries
and had a reaction.

29:02.323 --> 29:04.409
And at the time I was, like,

29:04.492 --> 29:06.619
"Well, I'm really...

29:06.703 --> 29:09.706
I can't believe that this
is still happening at this time,

29:09.789 --> 29:12.000
but maybe somebody will
do something about it

29:12.083 --> 29:14.335
now that it's happened to somebody else."

29:14.419 --> 29:17.881
And it was then that I was informed
that the person had died.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.470
And it shocked me,

29:23.553 --> 29:26.765
because it could have been my daughter.

29:27.682 --> 29:31.561
And I was just grateful that it wasn't.

29:33.104 --> 29:37.400
[ominous music]

29:39.277 --> 29:41.571
[Richard Wright]  There were
no changes to the menus.

29:41.988 --> 29:45.366
The menus did not reveal
that there was peanut in the dishes.

29:45.450 --> 29:49.913
And there was no evidence
of any staff training being put in place.

29:49.996 --> 29:52.999
If you had done things right,
this should never have happened.

29:53.082 --> 29:55.794
If you had taken steps,
this should never have happened.

29:55.877 --> 29:59.005
If you had trained your staff,
this should never have happened.

29:59.088 --> 30:04.010
And the saddest thing is that
the things that needed to be done

30:04.093 --> 30:07.639
to keep Paul Wilson alive
and to protect customers,

30:07.722 --> 30:09.224
they were tiny steps.

30:09.599 --> 30:12.852
It wasn't just a case
of someone making a mistake.

30:12.936 --> 30:16.105
It was a case of a catalog of mistakes

30:16.189 --> 30:18.316
that had gone on for a long time,

30:18.399 --> 30:22.362
and it's amazing how someone
hadn't already died

30:22.445 --> 30:25.240
from eating a meal
from one of those restaurants.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.078
[narrator]  And so,

30:30.161 --> 30:34.415
the Crown Prosecution Service
decided to pursue criminal charges.

30:35.291 --> 30:40.588
We were saying that the negligence
of Mr. Zaman was so bad, so gross,

30:40.672 --> 30:42.924
that it amounted to a criminal offense.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.426
There was no prospect

30:45.510 --> 30:50.014
that Paul Wilson was going to get
a safe meal from that kitchen.

30:50.598 --> 30:53.810
So many opportunities to put things right
had been missed,

30:53.893 --> 30:57.480
that it was almost inevitable
that this accident was going to happen.

30:58.731 --> 31:01.985
[narrator]  It would be the first ever
prosecution of a restaurateur

31:02.068 --> 31:03.653
in a food allergy case.

31:04.320 --> 31:08.408
There was some caution
around whether this should proceed.

31:08.491 --> 31:12.078
There were no guidelines
for an offense of this type.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.873
We were in uncharted waters.

31:16.499 --> 31:20.879
[narrator]  The case against Mohammed Zaman
went to trial in 2016.

31:21.462 --> 31:25.800
[Richard Wright]  Mr. Zaman was very keen
to blame everybody and anybody he could,

31:25.884 --> 31:27.260
other than himself.

31:27.719 --> 31:31.139
He claimed he had removed
all peanut from his kitchens

31:31.222 --> 31:34.559
and instructed all of his staff
to change their ways.

31:34.642 --> 31:38.897
But the fact that Paul Wilson died
demonstrated that could not have happened.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.566
I think he had told himself so many lies

31:41.649 --> 31:46.738
that he convinced himself
he was correct, and in the right.

31:46.821 --> 31:47.822
And he wasn't.

31:49.657 --> 31:54.162
[narrator]  After a day of deliberating,
the jury found Mohammed Zaman guilty

31:54.245 --> 31:56.998
of gross negligence manslaughter.

31:58.416 --> 32:01.169
[Richard Wright]  The total sentence
was six years imprisonment.

32:01.252 --> 32:03.630
Six years for the offense of manslaughter.

32:06.341 --> 32:10.386
It's a sentence which
sends out a message, I think,

32:10.470 --> 32:13.264
to other restaurants and takeaways,

32:13.348 --> 32:16.559
that they have a duty of care
for their customers.

32:16.643 --> 32:21.439
People can say, "Oh, it wasn't fair.
It wasn't him that did it."

32:21.522 --> 32:25.944
But when you put yourself out there,
and buy these restaurants and takeaways,

32:26.611 --> 32:29.322
you are responsible
for what goes on in them.

32:33.451 --> 32:35.995
These people knew what they were doing.

32:36.079 --> 32:37.205
You've got...

32:37.830 --> 32:38.873
a responsibility.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.416
You've got a duty of care.

32:40.875 --> 32:41.793
[Paul] Yeah.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.341
[narrator]  The death of Paul Wilson
is not unique.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.010
Nearly half of food allergy deaths

32:51.094 --> 32:54.472
are caused by food from restaurants
or other food services.

32:58.101 --> 33:04.273
But doctors are still struggling with
the core questions: why? And why now?

33:06.025 --> 33:08.486
[Ruslan Medzhitov]
We want to understand what makes

33:08.569 --> 33:10.822
one organism hypersensitive,

33:10.905 --> 33:12.156
hyperreactive,

33:12.240 --> 33:15.410
versus another organism
that would be normally reactive.

33:15.994 --> 33:19.956
And that is not clear
and not obvious at all.

33:21.958 --> 33:25.712
Such a dramatic and quick increase
in incidence

33:25.795 --> 33:29.382
indicates there is something changing
about our environment.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.968
We all know genetics is part of it.

33:32.051 --> 33:36.180
But then what is this environmental piece
that may be pushing us towards allergies?

33:36.514 --> 33:39.017
We really have to look
at how things have changed.

33:40.351 --> 33:43.896
[narrator]  One leading theory
points to the population of microbes

33:43.980 --> 33:46.524
that live in our guts: our microbiome.

33:47.066 --> 33:49.569
That population ain't what it used to be.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.239
Infants at birth
or in the first year of life,

33:53.322 --> 33:56.576
are getting antibiotics
much more commonly.

33:56.659 --> 33:57.869
What does that do?

33:57.952 --> 34:01.247
It kind of wipes out your gut bacteria,
your normal flora.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.792
We're kind of going
into a more clean state.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.961
Microbes come from playing in the dirt.

34:07.545 --> 34:11.466
Now there's fewer animals,
and people are having fewer children.

34:12.925 --> 34:16.304
You know,
it's the whole microbiome spectrum.

34:16.387 --> 34:21.309
So it's hard to pinpoint which
environmental piece is causing this,

34:21.893 --> 34:25.897
but something, and maybe it's
most commonly, most probably,

34:25.980 --> 34:29.776
a combination
of multiple environmental triggers

34:29.859 --> 34:32.153
that are changing the microbiome.

34:33.196 --> 34:37.366
[narrator]  This lack of bacteria
may be confusing our immune system,

34:37.450 --> 34:40.286
and so may the absence
of much larger attackers.

34:42.580 --> 34:47.752
Parasitic worms have been living
with humans for centuries.

34:47.835 --> 34:50.129
And as we became more clean,

34:51.172 --> 34:54.175
we have gotten rid of parasitic worms
as part of us.

34:54.258 --> 34:57.804
Has that caused our immune system
to take off in a different direction?

34:58.221 --> 35:01.766
[narrator]  It seems to specialists
that modern medicine and sanitation

35:01.849 --> 35:05.394
have changed an ancient balance
inside our bodies.

35:07.355 --> 35:11.484
Profound changes have also affected
the food we grow and eat.

35:14.362 --> 35:19.075
[Ruslan]  The whole process
of plant domestication and agriculture

35:19.492 --> 35:22.495
made foods much more eatable.

35:22.578 --> 35:25.998
But as we went one step further
with industrial food production,

35:26.082 --> 35:29.127
there was a further reduction
in some of these substances

35:29.210 --> 35:30.711
that normally come with food,

35:30.795 --> 35:33.673
including non-nutrient substances,

35:33.756 --> 35:34.757
that may not be toxic

35:34.841 --> 35:37.969
but they are just normally part of food,
and we evolved to eat it.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.638
If we eliminate that completely,

35:40.721 --> 35:44.183
just like if we eliminate
all the microbes from the body,

35:44.267 --> 35:46.060
I think we cannot function normally.

35:48.187 --> 35:52.233
I think that, in terms of what foods
we should have him avoid,

35:52.316 --> 35:54.402
for sure we should have him avoid milk.

35:54.902 --> 35:57.196
I mean, the regular milk test
was positive.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.241
The baked milk test,
the casein was positive.

36:00.324 --> 36:04.203
We should probably do another blood test.
I just think we need more information.

36:04.287 --> 36:05.830
Now he's avoiding milk...

36:05.913 --> 36:08.875
[narrator]  Most people with allergies
learn the hard way.

36:10.126 --> 36:15.423
I asked my fiancée and my babysitter
to give him formula,

36:15.506 --> 36:18.467
which was a cow milk protein,
and they did.

36:18.551 --> 36:23.514
And that day we actually had to take him
to Lurie Children's Hospital ER

36:24.098 --> 36:25.141
in Chicago.

36:25.224 --> 36:27.935
And his eyes were completely swollen shut,

36:28.019 --> 36:30.980
he didn't have much energy,
his face was swollen

36:31.063 --> 36:35.276
and his eyes were turning a different,
dark color of red underneath his eyes,

36:35.359 --> 36:36.527
and he was really sick.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.700
[narrator]  Food allergies
can be a moving target.

36:42.783 --> 36:46.579
Many people diagnosed as children
will outgrow their allergies,

36:46.662 --> 36:50.208
but will continue avoiding the foods
because they are unaware.

36:50.541 --> 36:53.252
Food allergies affect 4% of adults,

36:53.336 --> 36:57.048
but a full 30% believe
they have an allergy.

36:57.673 --> 37:01.969
The way we currently diagnose it is,
you have to have a reaction to a food,

37:02.053 --> 37:05.848
and then we test your blood
or do a skin prick test.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.975
So if both of those...

37:08.059 --> 37:11.646
If you had an allergic reaction
when you ate a peanut

37:11.729 --> 37:15.983
and your peanut-specific IgE is positive
or your skin prick test is positive,

37:16.067 --> 37:17.693
then we label it as a food allergy.

37:18.653 --> 37:22.031
[narrator]  The skin prick is
the best-known test for food allergies.

37:22.657 --> 37:26.118
Tiny amounts of potential allergens
are poked under the skin

37:26.202 --> 37:28.788
to provoke small but detectable reactions.

37:31.499 --> 37:34.043
An alternate method
tests a patient's blood,

37:34.126 --> 37:37.213
to see which immunoglobulins are present.

37:38.965 --> 37:41.342
I'm sorry, Leo. I'm so sorry.

37:42.593 --> 37:46.639
[narrator]  But even after years
of refinement, neither tool delivers.

37:47.890 --> 37:48.933
[nurse] You are so brave.

37:49.016 --> 37:52.561
[Ruchi Gupta]  Unfortunately, the testing
we have for food allergy is not ideal.

37:52.645 --> 37:56.107
So the only way we have right now
to truly know,

37:56.190 --> 37:59.235
is to eat the food and see what happens.

37:59.735 --> 38:04.365
[narrator]  It's called the food challenge,
and it tests the limits of the body.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.577
You sit in a room
at the allergist's office,

38:08.661 --> 38:11.455
and you eat the food
that you're allergic to.

38:12.373 --> 38:15.126
Start with small quantities
and increase it over time.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.462
And if you do not react,

38:19.213 --> 38:23.217
then hopefully, you have
completely outgrown that food

38:23.301 --> 38:25.052
and can introduce it into your diet.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.681
[soft music]

38:28.764 --> 38:31.684
[sizzles]

38:33.352 --> 38:35.813
If you don't have a family
or a friend that has it,

38:35.896 --> 38:38.441
you're actually not aware
of how life-threatening,

38:38.524 --> 38:40.860
and what a pain in the rear
food allergies can be.

38:41.527 --> 38:43.696
[narrator]  One year
after opening Blue Ginger

38:43.779 --> 38:46.198
and working to accommodate
allergic customers,

38:46.282 --> 38:49.327
Ming Tsai went from proprietor
to allergy dad.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.831
It was the very unfunny joke from upstairs
to give me a child

38:53.914 --> 38:57.752
that has allergies to soy, wheat, dairy,
shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, eggs.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.295
Seven of the eight.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.255
I'm like, "Oh, my God."

39:01.339 --> 39:04.425
And we went to our pediatrician
and he basically said,

39:05.176 --> 39:08.262
"Well, don't eat the foods. Good luck."

39:08.346 --> 39:10.514
We're like, "Don't eat those foods?
Good luck?"

39:10.598 --> 39:12.350
"Yeah, I can't do anything. Sorry."

39:13.642 --> 39:17.229
[narrator]  Ming and his wife kept
their son David away from dangerous foods

39:17.313 --> 39:18.898
until he was four.

39:19.607 --> 39:23.027
But one night
a babysitter forgot the warnings.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.821
[Ming Tsai]  David asked for some milk.

39:25.905 --> 39:28.366
Now milk, to David, is his rice milk.

39:29.325 --> 39:30.701
She serves him regular milk.

39:30.785 --> 39:34.997
And he's like,
"I'm having problems breathing."

39:35.456 --> 39:37.249
And that's...

39:37.792 --> 39:40.544
You cannot be more scared as a parent,
when you hear that.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.423
First you wish it was you, not your child.

39:44.507 --> 39:48.469
But we're just so grateful we had...
we were prepared. We had the EpiPen.

39:48.552 --> 39:51.889
But there's never been
a scarier moment in my life than,

39:51.972 --> 39:53.557
"I can't breathe, Dad."

40:00.106 --> 40:02.775
[Ruchi Gupta]  I was doing research
on food allergies.

40:03.567 --> 40:08.489
And my own daughter was diagnosed
with food allergies about nine years ago.

40:11.117 --> 40:14.370
Something that I pretty much
spent most of my time studying

40:14.453 --> 40:16.747
now became a reality in my own world.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.921
Until you experience it,
you don't understand it completely.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.176
Although you would never wish it,

40:29.260 --> 40:32.888
it has informed so much
of the research we do.

40:32.972 --> 40:34.765
Riya, do you have your lunchbox?

40:35.182 --> 40:36.225
Oh, yeah.

40:36.308 --> 40:37.935
[Ruchi] What are you taking today?

40:39.103 --> 40:43.149
Today, I have the grilled cheese
that you made me.

40:43.232 --> 40:44.191
OK.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.944
And a nut-free chocolate bar.

40:47.027 --> 40:51.407
I really started to fully understand
the impact it has

40:51.490 --> 40:54.910
on every aspect of a child's life,
every single day.

40:55.494 --> 40:57.496
You have your epinephrine?

40:58.664 --> 40:59.707
Yeah.

41:00.791 --> 41:04.587
For Natalie and for my family,
there's the physical health.

41:04.670 --> 41:07.882
But honestly, I'm equally concerned
about her emotional health.

41:08.382 --> 41:12.178
She never went to the grocery store,
didn't fly, didn't go to people's houses.

41:12.511 --> 41:16.599
At some schools now, they have
separate tables for the allergy kids,

41:16.682 --> 41:20.519
or they will have no peanut products,
or whatever, in their home.

41:21.061 --> 41:23.731
A blue cafeteria tray
is what they thought of,

41:23.814 --> 41:25.941
to distinguish the food allergy kids.

41:26.025 --> 41:29.069
There were hand wipes for everybody
going into her classroom.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.321
I mean, it was...

41:30.988 --> 41:33.657
really restrictive at every turn.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.993
When they go out into the real world

41:36.076 --> 41:39.622
and they're wondering when
they're at their workplace or university,

41:39.705 --> 41:42.041
"Why isn't this table nut-free?"

41:42.124 --> 41:43.209
It's not going to be.

41:43.292 --> 41:46.587
At a ballpark, in a movie theater,
on a date or whatever.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.756
That's just not the reality.

41:52.051 --> 41:55.554
[narrator]  And avoidance
might even be a cause of the problem.

41:56.931 --> 42:00.351
One of the remarkable developments
in food allergy medicine

42:00.434 --> 42:03.896
has been a radical reinterpretation
of early exposure.

42:05.022 --> 42:08.817
In the year 2000,
the American Academy of Pediatrics

42:08.901 --> 42:13.739
recommended against feeding peanuts
and peanut butter to children under three.

42:13.822 --> 42:17.660
We were just starting to see this increase
and we didn't know what to do.

42:17.743 --> 42:19.620
So let's just avoid it, right?

42:19.703 --> 42:21.580
We don't want
these kids anaphylaxing.

42:22.081 --> 42:23.999
[narrator]  But then, in 2008,

42:24.458 --> 42:28.796
a study demonstrated an extremely
low prevalence of peanut allergy

42:28.879 --> 42:30.172
in Israel.

42:30.798 --> 42:34.677
[atmospheric guitar music]

42:38.097 --> 42:40.432
[narrator]  That result was tied to Bamba,

42:40.975 --> 42:44.728
a peanut-based snack
widely eaten by small children.

42:47.273 --> 42:51.360
[Gupta]  If you actually introduce peanut
to an infant from 4 to 11 months,

42:51.986 --> 42:56.574
they may actually significantly decrease
their chances of developing it

42:56.657 --> 42:59.368
by almost 80% in those high-risk kids.

42:59.827 --> 43:04.873
So now the AAP changed their guidelines
to say: "Introduce it to your child."

43:06.041 --> 43:09.211
[narrator]  This same concept,
"Just eat the food,"

43:09.295 --> 43:12.631
is now being tested
in several new medical treatments.

43:14.466 --> 43:19.722
All of them involve introducing
the food protein to the individual.

43:23.100 --> 43:26.770
Starting with small amounts,
until their immune system recognizes it

43:26.854 --> 43:29.231
and can tolerate
larger and greater amounts.

43:29.940 --> 43:33.611
So I started out with Mini Oreos.
I had, like, three Mini Oreos.

43:34.111 --> 43:36.905
And then the next week...
Two weeks later, I had nine.

43:37.281 --> 43:38.490
This is my morning dose,

43:38.574 --> 43:42.244
which is 10,000 milligrams
of just plain peanuts.

43:42.870 --> 43:46.206
Fifty milligrams of wheat
was my original tolerance level.

43:46.290 --> 43:47.708
Now I'm up to...

43:47.791 --> 43:50.336
I got up to the point
where I could eat eight grams,

43:50.419 --> 43:51.962
which is 8,000 milligrams.

43:52.046 --> 43:53.714
So it was from 50 to 8,000.

43:53.797 --> 43:57.343
So she got cleared to eat things
that might have cross-contact

43:57.426 --> 44:01.055
the day before her birthday,
like, almost two years ago.

44:01.138 --> 44:03.057
And what have you done since then?

44:03.140 --> 44:05.142
Well, I've had a lot of things.

44:08.437 --> 44:10.648
I've had Chinese.

44:11.315 --> 44:12.900
Indian. I like Indian.

44:13.275 --> 44:15.194
And then the thing just goes on and on,

44:15.277 --> 44:17.488
to the point where I had
Sprinkles cupcakes,

44:17.571 --> 44:19.823
like, the things a kid wants, basically,

44:19.907 --> 44:21.992
that I grew up not being able to eat.

44:22.618 --> 44:24.745
All the tests still show
that I'm allergic,

44:24.828 --> 44:27.456
and just because
I'm eating peanuts every day

44:27.539 --> 44:30.042
and I'm able to do it, most days,

44:30.125 --> 44:32.336
doesn't mean that I'm not allergic.

44:32.419 --> 44:34.296
It's most days that I'm OK.

44:34.380 --> 44:37.966
Sometimes I do have reactions
for a variety of reasons.

44:38.384 --> 44:41.637
And you know, it's not a cure, not yet.

44:41.720 --> 44:45.557
It began in 2012 and since then,
my life has just completely changed.

44:45.641 --> 44:48.018
Yeah, it's
a completely different life, now.

44:48.102 --> 44:52.981
We are hoping some of these treatments
start coming to market in the next year.

44:53.524 --> 44:55.109
Can't promise a cure, you know,

44:55.192 --> 44:59.029
but good treatments coming our way
in the next five to ten years

44:59.113 --> 45:00.739
are highly likely.

45:03.283 --> 45:06.328
[narrator]  That's encouraging
for allergy sufferers,

45:06.412 --> 45:08.455
and good news for peanut farmers, too.

45:12.251 --> 45:14.294
Now here's what you do.

45:14.378 --> 45:15.963
Take it like this...

45:16.338 --> 45:17.673
And then...

45:18.632 --> 45:19.842
No, I'm serious.

45:19.925 --> 45:21.093
Then look at the ground,

45:21.176 --> 45:23.971
and any insects on there,
they'll be on the ground.

45:24.054 --> 45:25.222
See? Right there.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.308
[Glenn] That could
either be a corn earworm,

45:29.059 --> 45:30.936
or some kind of army worm.

45:32.438 --> 45:34.731
Always look for white mold
right here, Casey.

45:34.815 --> 45:36.817
-In the middle.
-Yeah, in the middle.

45:37.359 --> 45:39.236
[Casey]  When you grow a crop,
when you're a farmer,

45:39.319 --> 45:42.573
the last thing you want is for someone
to be afraid of what you produce.

45:43.699 --> 45:46.201
You know how hard we work
to get this crop.

45:46.285 --> 45:47.995
From day one,
how expensive to grow.

45:49.621 --> 45:51.415
To put everything into your crop,

45:51.498 --> 45:55.711
and then all you hear is negative reports
on it, it's kind of disheartening.

45:55.794 --> 45:58.046
[Casey]
I really hope that in the next few years,

45:58.130 --> 46:00.841
continued science and research
will encourage people

46:00.924 --> 46:04.428
to not do an all-out ban of peanuts.

46:05.387 --> 46:09.475
We don't want anyone to have
a negative experience with peanuts,

46:09.558 --> 46:11.310
because it is our livelihood.

46:11.727 --> 46:14.813
[narrator]  In fact, peanut farmers,
including Casey and Glenn,

46:14.897 --> 46:17.816
have started funding
food allergy research.

46:17.900 --> 46:20.277
Their alliance, the National Peanut Board,

46:20.360 --> 46:23.655
has already contributed
nearly $22 million.

46:24.573 --> 46:27.326
No one wants to see money taken out
of the bottom line,

46:27.409 --> 46:29.453
but in this case it's a good thing.

46:29.536 --> 46:32.122
We have plans for the future.
She's the future for us.

46:32.873 --> 46:36.585
And we'll do whatever we need to,
to make it work.

46:39.755 --> 46:41.715
[tense music]
