00:14.400 --> 00:17.341
This is Jenny's statement to
the press about the C.T.U. Bombing.

00:17.469 --> 00:19.580
Any casualties?

00:19.676 --> 00:22.842
- Over a dozen so far.
- Those people are dead because of you.

00:22.938 --> 00:24.826
You're out, Eric,
effective immediately.

00:24.953 --> 00:27.095
You can't dismiss me now, sir.

00:27.192 --> 00:29.174
I need someone I can trust.

00:29.302 --> 00:32.340
Reza may be involved
with a terrorist.

00:32.435 --> 00:36.753
He's been in contact with someone
who finances terrorist operations.

00:36.881 --> 00:39.726
Trust me.
He is not a terrorist.

00:39.854 --> 00:41.805
I want you to drop
this nonsense...

00:41.932 --> 00:44.234
and start treating Reza
like a member of the family.

00:44.329 --> 00:45.644
How bad is she?

00:45.739 --> 00:47.529
She needs surgery.
We can't do that in the field.

00:47.626 --> 00:49.480
- She stays here.
- George, we can't keep her here.

00:49.576 --> 00:51.047
Everything we have
on this nuke has been destroyed.

00:51.175 --> 00:54.020
The only intel we have left is the
database that Paula sent to the N.S. A...

00:54.115 --> 00:55.522
and they didn't get
the code.

00:55.619 --> 00:57.538
Well, then, we'll assign
other I.T. People to retrieve it.

00:57.666 --> 00:59.329
We don't have time!

00:59.424 --> 01:03.295
- I want to go with her.
- " I have some questions first."

01:03.421 --> 01:06.332
- We got out in time. She wasrt
injured in the explosion.
- "Yes, I know."

01:06.461 --> 01:09.305
From what I've seen, her head injury
most likely occurred before the blast.

01:09.435 --> 01:14.007
- You don't think I did this?
- I'm gonna let the police sort that out.

01:14.103 --> 01:17.044
Eddie told me everything went off
without a hitch.
What happened between then and now?

01:17.172 --> 01:19.602
I killed them... for resisting arrest.

01:19.730 --> 01:21.329
I'll kill you too, Joe.

01:21.424 --> 01:24.176
Whoever set you up to do
this job, Joe, they used you.

01:24.270 --> 01:29.037
The woman who gave me the plans
to C. T.U., I only met her twice.

01:29.164 --> 01:31.275
I can't go back to jail.

01:31.370 --> 01:32.585
No!

01:45.120 --> 01:47.104
None of these girders
are stable.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.791
I can't guarantee that
they're gonna hold.

01:49.887 --> 01:52.349
And nothing behind
this corded area is safe.

01:52.477 --> 01:55.769
I don't want to see anyone in there,
or I'll shut the building down.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.752
I don't care
what the governor says.

02:00.918 --> 02:04.659
No, don't even try that bank.
The switches were totally destroyed.

02:04.755 --> 02:06.899
See if you can set up
a generator line to the "A" island.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.880
All right, I'm on it.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.599
We've got to get her
out of here.

02:17.642 --> 02:18.794
- What's the progress here?
- We're trying to bring her around...

02:18.889 --> 02:21.287
using a combination
of stimulants and hydrating fluids.

02:21.415 --> 02:23.079
But it might make
her more unstable.

02:23.175 --> 02:24.965
We're running out of time,
so just wake her up.

02:27.267 --> 02:29.731
- Where are you headed?
- To follow up on a lead
that just came in.

02:29.859 --> 02:32.608
There's an L.A. Connection
to Syed Ali.

02:32.704 --> 02:35.807
Well, look, send somebody else.
I need you here.

02:35.902 --> 02:38.460
To do what?
Watch Paula die?

02:38.556 --> 02:41.082
Tony, we got to get
the encryption codes out of her,
or we're gonna lose everything.

02:41.178 --> 02:42.999
We can't let that happen today.

02:43.095 --> 02:45.654
Yeah, well, like I said, you got it
covered. I'm gonna follow up on this lead.

02:45.751 --> 02:50.004
- No. You're gonna stay here,
and that's an order.
- Look.

02:50.133 --> 02:52.020
There's a Middle Eastern
businessman in L. A"..."

02:52.115 --> 02:54.992
who's had contact with
Syed Ali recently.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.709
Now, Ivers and Appell are dead.
Who do you want me to send?

02:59.246 --> 03:01.676
Be reachable.
All right?

03:01.804 --> 03:04.009
Yeah.

03:04.106 --> 03:06.664
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

03:06.760 --> 03:10.565
- Putting Band-Aids on the network?
- Yeah, I'm on it.

03:10.693 --> 03:12.964
Mr. Mason?
It's Jack Bauer.

03:13.891 --> 03:15.714
Jack?
What is it?

03:15.842 --> 03:19.615
George, I got to Wald. I found out
who commissioned him to take out C.T.U.

03:19.743 --> 03:22.493
- Who?
- It was Nina Myers.

03:22.589 --> 03:25.819
- Nina?
- She was his connection to C.T.U.

03:25.915 --> 03:27.770
It doesn't make any sense.
She's been in prison.

03:27.866 --> 03:29.688
Wald approached her
before we took her down.

03:29.784 --> 03:33.205
She sold him everything, George:
Schematics, gate information,
personal data.

03:33.334 --> 03:35.156
All of this has to be
connected to the nuke.

03:35.252 --> 03:38.546
So, what, they bombed C.T.U.
To cripple our response capability?

03:38.643 --> 03:40.751
Yes, yes.
I've already called Chappelle.

03:40.848 --> 03:43.374
- You what?
- I couldn't find you, George.

03:43.470 --> 03:46.796
- What did he say?
- He agreed we need to talk to her.

03:46.924 --> 03:49.739
He's having her transferred
over to C.T.U. Now for questioning.

03:49.836 --> 03:53.417
Look, why don't you debrief at Division?
It's a total disaster here.

03:53.513 --> 03:56.294
- Well, what are you gonna do about Nina?
- I'll take care of it.

03:56.390 --> 03:58.883
Don't just hand her over
to the F.B.I., George.

03:59.011 --> 04:01.603
Forget it, Jack.
You did a great job, okay?

04:01.698 --> 04:04.544
- Go find yourself some place safe.
- George...

04:04.672 --> 04:08.446
Michelle, can you get somebody
to set up an interrogation room?

04:08.573 --> 04:09.757
- We got somebody coming in.
- Who?

04:09.852 --> 04:12.283
Nina Myers.

04:12.411 --> 04:14.170
The C.T.U. Agent who
killed Jack's wife?

04:14.266 --> 04:16.536
I need as close
to maximum security as I can get.

04:16.632 --> 04:19.223
And three armed agents
standing by.

04:20.821 --> 04:23.506
We've reduced the likelihood
on some of the targets.

04:23.603 --> 04:26.160
We're left with six
probable sectors.

04:26.257 --> 04:29.039
There's the harbor...
Port of Los Angeles.

04:29.134 --> 04:31.118
It's one of the busiest ports
in the world. A strike there...

04:31.246 --> 04:33.068
will knock out
"infrastructure"...

04:33.165 --> 04:36.266
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. President.
The ambassador's just about to land.

04:36.361 --> 04:38.474
Has there been any communication
while he was en route?

04:38.568 --> 04:41.255
No, not since this morning when it was
decided he would come here.

04:41.351 --> 04:44.452
- Is he alone?
- No, he's being accompanied
by Farhad Salim...

04:44.547 --> 04:46.371
their ranking
intelligence officer.

04:46.466 --> 04:50.305
Get me anything new we've learned about
Second Wave since this morning.

04:50.433 --> 04:53.279
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, and Lynne?

04:53.407 --> 04:55.613
Is Roger here yet?

04:55.709 --> 04:58.554
He's upstairs.
They're bringing him up to speed...

04:58.681 --> 05:00.857
on Rayburn's dismissal.

05:00.953 --> 05:03.672
Good.

05:03.767 --> 05:06.645
As far south as
Mexico, but as I mentioned previously...

05:06.773 --> 05:08.915
downtown Los Angeles is
particularly vulnerable.

05:09.012 --> 05:11.154
That's where the five
major freeways merge.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.521
If they hit this area,
we'd also have...

05:13.649 --> 05:18.286
Dr. Gerard, radiology.
Dr. Gerard, radiology.

05:43.290 --> 05:46.873
Everything's gonna
be okay, Kim.

05:50.456 --> 05:52.375
I'll tell you what.

05:53.782 --> 05:56.467
If you leave now...

05:56.563 --> 05:59.280
I'll tell the police that
it was just a misunderstanding.

05:59.375 --> 06:02.126
If you don't,
they're gonna arrest you.

06:02.222 --> 06:05.548
- Arrest me for what?
- For kidnapping my daughter.

06:08.714 --> 06:11.593
Where's Carla?

06:11.719 --> 06:13.317
As soon as these officers
talk to the doctor, Kim...

06:13.414 --> 06:16.262
it's gonna be pretty obvious
that you're the one that hurt her.

06:16.357 --> 06:19.011
That's a lie and you know it.
I would never hurt her.

06:19.106 --> 06:20.962
I've been protecting her
from you.

06:21.057 --> 06:24.574
Well, the only thing
that can be "proved," Kim...

06:24.670 --> 06:27.358
is that you took Megan
without our permission.

06:29.370 --> 06:31.834
You beat up your wife.
Who's gonna believe you?

06:33.305 --> 06:36.150
Carla will back me up.
You know that.

06:38.965 --> 06:41.587
I mean,
if you don't believe me...

06:41.684 --> 06:44.624
we can give her a call.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.191
You wanna do that?

06:47.438 --> 06:50.219
Go ahead, Kim, call her.

06:56.745 --> 06:59.973
You walk away
while you have the chance.

07:00.069 --> 07:01.956
Otherwise,
you're going to jail.

07:03.587 --> 07:06.530
Stay away from my family!

07:06.657 --> 07:09.120
Don't ever come
to my house again.

07:19.608 --> 07:21.559
Look, I wouldn't
rule anything out, Mike.

07:21.687 --> 07:24.725
If you co-opt local enforcement
at this time the story could leak...

07:24.821 --> 07:26.675
and that's one
of my biggest concerns here.

07:28.850 --> 07:31.664
You know what? Roger's walking in.
I'll talk to you when you land.

07:34.254 --> 07:38.475
- Mr. President.
- Roger. It's good to see you.

07:38.571 --> 07:42.729
- Come into my office.
- Afternoon, everyone.

07:42.826 --> 07:46.118
- Be with you shortly.
- Very good, sir.

07:46.246 --> 07:48.963
I can't tell you
how disturbed I was...

07:49.060 --> 07:51.457
with Eric's decision
regarding C.T.U.

07:51.585 --> 07:55.393
- Twenty-nine dead and counting.
- It's inexcusable.

07:55.521 --> 07:58.687
There'll be a full investigation,
possible criminal charges.

07:58.782 --> 08:01.627
You know I hate to meddle
in your rice bowl...

08:01.755 --> 08:04.794
but on a day like today
I couldn't wait for you to arrive.

08:04.889 --> 08:07.383
- Say no more.
- Are you caught up on everything?

08:07.510 --> 08:10.454
I'm caught up.
I'd like to talk to you...

08:10.581 --> 08:12.243
about this meeting
with the ambassador.

08:12.340 --> 08:14.163
Hmm.
What are your thoughts?

08:14.258 --> 08:17.296
We have everything to lose,
nothing to gain.

08:17.392 --> 08:19.951
Well, what we have to gain
is stopping a nuclear bomb.

08:20.048 --> 08:23.756
But this meeting benefits
only the other side.

08:23.851 --> 08:26.315
He wants to be able
to say to the world...

08:26.442 --> 08:30.310
" Look, we "tried"
to stop the bomb."

08:30.438 --> 08:33.636
It's a ploy to gain access
to our intelligence, nothing more.

08:43.006 --> 08:44.830
You might be right...

08:44.925 --> 08:47.898
but I'm not as certain
as you are.

08:49.274 --> 08:51.096
I'm gonna meet with him.

08:51.192 --> 08:52.727
Very good, sir.

08:52.855 --> 08:55.926
- Anything else?
- Not at this time.

08:56.023 --> 08:58.485
Hold on. Sir.

08:58.613 --> 09:01.297
Off-duty agents are finally arriving,
and Division called.

09:01.393 --> 09:03.951
The chopper just lifted off.
Nina Myers is on board.

09:04.048 --> 09:06.893
Good. Let's set up the mobile video unit
for the interrogation then.

09:06.990 --> 09:10.251
Okay. Laurie, I need you
to call downstairs.

09:10.347 --> 09:13.641
Get Bill. Have him bring up
a video rack, okay?

09:27.232 --> 09:30.302
Jack, what the hell are you doing here?
I sent you to Division.

09:30.399 --> 09:32.571
I want to do
the debrief here.

09:32.667 --> 09:34.267
I'm not gonna mince words with you.
Nina killed your wife.

09:34.363 --> 09:36.218
I don't want you
anywhere near her.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.137
George, my goal is the same
as yours: To stop this bomb.

09:38.232 --> 09:40.055
It makes more sense
that I do the debrief here...

09:40.151 --> 09:42.998
because there's no information
on the Wald op "at" Division.

09:44.725 --> 09:47.505
- Please.
- All right.

09:47.601 --> 09:49.968
Let me set you up with Knoll
at, uh, Tech Support.

09:50.094 --> 09:52.493
- What about Ivers?
- Dead.

09:52.621 --> 09:55.277
- Clark?
- Dead.

09:55.373 --> 09:57.163
We lost a lot
of good people, Jack.

10:07.843 --> 10:11.873
- I'll get started on the debrief.
- Hey, do us both a favor.

10:11.969 --> 10:14.112
Finish and go.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.564
Yeah.

10:20.251 --> 10:21.690
She's awake.

10:23.353 --> 10:25.590
You better move fast.
I don't know how much time you have.

10:25.687 --> 10:27.702
Come on.
Let's go.

10:27.829 --> 10:30.676
Paula? It's George Mason.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.456
- Can you hear me?
- What happened?

10:33.553 --> 10:37.743
We had a big explosion. Do you
remember the encryption codes, Paula?

10:37.839 --> 10:39.884
You're the only one
who has them.

10:41.900 --> 10:44.203
- Stay with us, Paula.
- " Paula."

10:44.299 --> 10:47.209
You were transferring files out
to N.S.A. Do you remember that?

10:49.509 --> 10:52.388
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, the transfer didn't complete.

10:52.516 --> 10:54.402
They didn't have
the source decryption key.

10:57.218 --> 10:59.042
- The source?
- Yeah.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.759
The source key.
That's right.

11:01.855 --> 11:04.636
See, normally you send it in a separate
packet, but the router was destroyed.

11:04.731 --> 11:08.985
Did you make a copy
of the source key before you sent it?

11:09.081 --> 11:11.704
Yeah.

11:12.726 --> 11:16.117
What is it?
Do you remember?

11:16.245 --> 11:19.057
- Sub-volume.
- Okay.

11:21.490 --> 11:25.902
- Uh, which volume?
- Which-Which volume? Which one?

11:26.030 --> 11:27.277
Paula, stay with us.
Which one?

11:27.372 --> 11:30.314
Paula, your disk is partitioned
into over 50 volumes.

11:30.442 --> 11:32.618
Do you remember
which one?

11:38.788 --> 11:41.346
Etudes.

11:41.443 --> 11:44.130
Etudes.

11:44.225 --> 11:45.792
Come on, come on,
come on.

11:47.743 --> 11:49.212
Hang in there, sweetie.

11:53.178 --> 11:56.473
- That's it. That's it.
- Great.

11:56.569 --> 11:58.040
Hey, you did good.

11:58.168 --> 12:01.813
What you just did
is gonna save a lot of lives today.

12:01.908 --> 12:04.626
- The hospital, now. Move.
- Come on. Give me a hand. Let's go.

12:09.264 --> 12:11.469
She's in V-tach.

12:13.164 --> 12:15.307
Dave, are you ready?

12:15.402 --> 12:17.579
- Charge.
- Full charge, 360.

12:17.674 --> 12:19.559
Clear.

12:19.687 --> 12:22.375
- "Nothin"
- "Charging at 300."

12:22.470 --> 12:25.827
- " Come on, charge. Clear."
- "Charged."

12:26.852 --> 12:29.665
- No rhythm.
- "Flat line."

12:32.991 --> 12:34.973
She's gone.

13:10.437 --> 13:12.260
- I got it.
- You got it? You're sure?

13:12.355 --> 13:13.667
Yeah.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.551
- Hey.
- So, how'd you like the house?

13:19.646 --> 13:21.662
- You knew about it?
- Of course.

13:21.790 --> 13:24.059
Why do you think I insisted
you go with him?

13:24.155 --> 13:27.032
Dad, it's not that I think
Reza doesn't love Marie.

13:27.161 --> 13:30.263
- I just think if he's doing
things that are illegal...
- Honey, you don't know that.

13:30.358 --> 13:31.989
Well, I know Ralph Burton
found a transaction...

13:32.085 --> 13:35.731
in the company records
that link him to a known terrorist.

13:35.826 --> 13:38.513
Ralph Burton is a P.I.

13:38.610 --> 13:42.703
I mean, he could probably connect me
to the Manson family
if he looked hard enough.

13:42.799 --> 13:44.492
Yeah.

13:44.589 --> 13:47.020
Did they straighten out
that business about lunch?

13:47.148 --> 13:49.993
- Yeah. Another crisis averted.
- Thank you.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.719
Who's this?

13:51.816 --> 13:56.068
Hello, sir. I'm Tony Almeida
from Los Angeles C.T.U.

13:56.196 --> 13:57.731
- This is Agent Richards.
- C.T.U.?

13:57.858 --> 14:01.474
- What is C.T.U.?
- "Counterterrorist Unit."

14:01.571 --> 14:04.000
I'm looking
for a Reza Naiyeer.

14:04.127 --> 14:06.750
What's this all about?

14:06.845 --> 14:08.380
It's a government matter,
ma'am.

14:08.508 --> 14:10.266
A government matter?

14:10.363 --> 14:13.210
I just need to ask a few
questions of Mr. Naiyeer.

14:13.338 --> 14:15.287
Mr. Almeida, right?

14:15.415 --> 14:17.590
My daughter hired
a private investigator...

14:17.686 --> 14:19.158
to do a background check
on Reza.

14:19.286 --> 14:21.332
It's all been
cleared up.

14:21.458 --> 14:24.146
Actually, Dad, it hasn't
all been cleared up.

14:26.544 --> 14:30.669
Can this wait? You see, today is
my other daughter Marie's wedding.

14:30.765 --> 14:33.611
She's getting married
to Reza.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.425
Look, I'm sorry for
the bad timing, Mr. Warner...

14:36.520 --> 14:38.920
but, no,
this can't wait.

14:39.048 --> 14:42.948
Now, I'm authorized to
interrogate Mr. Naiyeer.

14:43.076 --> 14:46.178
Are you gonna take me to him,
or do I have to find him myself?

14:48.194 --> 14:50.081
Kate, go find Reza.

14:57.849 --> 14:59.674
What's going on here?

14:59.770 --> 15:03.063
All I can tell you is that
I'm part of an investigation
involving national security...

15:03.190 --> 15:06.229
and I'm hoping Mr. Naiyeer
can assist me.

15:10.193 --> 15:12.081
Hey, Kate.

15:20.938 --> 15:23.561
What's up?

15:23.657 --> 15:25.990
There's a man here
who needs to talk to you.

15:26.087 --> 15:28.933
- Who is he?
- He's from the government.

15:33.474 --> 15:37.566
- The government?
- A counterterrorism agency.

15:40.509 --> 15:43.578
- What are you talking about?
- That's all I know.

15:49.815 --> 15:51.733
What's this about, Kate?

15:51.861 --> 15:53.747
I don't know.

15:57.807 --> 16:01.263
Marie's in her room
adjusting her dress.

16:01.391 --> 16:04.045
You just make sure
she doesn't find out about this.

16:04.141 --> 16:06.571
Sure.

16:13.893 --> 16:15.716
Reza Naiyeer?

16:15.812 --> 16:17.954
- Yes.
- I'm Agent Richards.

16:18.050 --> 16:19.873
Right this way.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.430
Oh. What is that?

16:26.557 --> 16:28.379
- It's some lunch for you.
- Can you put it there?

16:28.474 --> 16:30.778
- " Sure."
- "Thanks."

16:30.873 --> 16:33.656
These heels are gonna kill me.

16:35.541 --> 16:38.419
I want you to know
that since your conversation...

16:38.547 --> 16:40.466
with the prime minister
this morning...

16:40.594 --> 16:44.847
we have taken four
suspected members of Second Wave...

16:44.975 --> 16:46.766
into custody...

16:46.862 --> 16:49.133
and we have begun
interrogations.

16:49.229 --> 16:51.052
What have you learned?

16:51.148 --> 16:53.034
We are still questioning them.

16:53.131 --> 16:56.903
As a ranking security officer,
I assure you...

16:57.031 --> 16:59.717
we are doing everything possible to
clamp down on this kind of activity.

16:59.813 --> 17:01.766
These satellite photos...

17:01.894 --> 17:04.739
were taken over your country
an hour ago.

17:10.877 --> 17:13.723
Doesn't look like
too much of a clampdown to me.

17:15.674 --> 17:19.127
We don't have the resources
that you do.

17:19.256 --> 17:21.207
And, surely, even you can't
tell me that you're aware...

17:21.334 --> 17:25.684
of every single paramilitary compound
currently operating in the U.S.

17:28.306 --> 17:31.343
If this bomb goes off,
Mr. President...

17:31.440 --> 17:35.501
and you don't believe that
we did everything possible to stop it...

17:35.596 --> 17:39.050
there will be heavy
repercussions for my country.

17:39.178 --> 17:41.063
You have already
made it quite clear...

17:41.192 --> 17:44.935
that you will have no choice
but to retaliate against us.

17:46.534 --> 17:48.420
We want to help.

17:50.338 --> 17:52.962
What do you propose?

17:53.057 --> 17:57.629
A mutual exchange
of intelligence.

17:59.228 --> 18:01.050
What kind of exchange?

18:01.147 --> 18:03.993
We need access to your files
on Second Wave.

18:04.090 --> 18:07.639
- Our files?
- Yes. Anything.

18:07.736 --> 18:09.940
Anything that pertains
to suspected terrorism in our country.

18:10.036 --> 18:14.737
I'm not sure how much intel it's in our
interest to share with you at this time.

18:14.833 --> 18:17.583
I understand your reservations,
Mr. President...

18:17.679 --> 18:20.110
but be assured...

18:20.237 --> 18:23.532
we want to prevent
this... incident.

18:23.628 --> 18:27.849
We are prepared for an exchange
in both directions.

18:27.944 --> 18:31.846
We are willing to open up
our files to you as well.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.586
I'll have to think about this,
Mr. Ambassador.

18:35.683 --> 18:39.489
- Of course.
- We've prepared a room for you.

18:39.617 --> 18:41.503
You'll have our answer shortly.

18:41.630 --> 18:43.870
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Mr. Ambassador.

18:43.965 --> 18:46.491
Mr. Stanton.

18:50.904 --> 18:53.207
Right this way, sir.

18:54.806 --> 18:57.683
You can't give him
this information, sir.

18:57.810 --> 19:00.081
Explain.
What's the downside?

19:00.177 --> 19:03.728
We have agents
in their country right now.

19:03.825 --> 19:05.998
Those files would expose
their identities.

19:06.094 --> 19:08.013
Fine.
Go through the files...

19:08.141 --> 19:10.602
take out anything that would
jeopardize our people.

19:10.731 --> 19:13.128
It's a dangerous precedent.

19:13.257 --> 19:15.622
We can't worry about
precedent, not today...

19:15.719 --> 19:17.541
not under the threat
of nuclear attack.

19:21.730 --> 19:26.432
I guess my point is
I don't trust the ambassador...

19:29.917 --> 19:31.740
and we can't ignore
the possibility...

19:31.835 --> 19:34.139
that his country
is supporting Second Wave.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.349
Lynne, what do you think?

19:42.739 --> 19:44.627
I agree with Roger.

19:44.755 --> 19:46.609
I think it's too risky.

19:59.752 --> 20:01.510
- Yeah?
- Dad, it's me.

20:01.607 --> 20:03.973
- Kim? Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.532
What about you? Were you at C.T.U.
When the bomb went off?

20:06.660 --> 20:09.283
No, honey, I'm fine. Look, are you
on your way up to Aunt Carol's?

20:09.378 --> 20:12.895
No, I haven't left yet. Look, what is
going on? You sounded weird on the phone.

20:12.991 --> 20:15.133
It doesn't matter. You have to
go to Aunt Carol's right away.

20:15.229 --> 20:16.861
I can't.
That's why I'm calling.

20:16.956 --> 20:18.908
- Why? What's wrong?
- It's Megan.

20:19.035 --> 20:22.041
Her dad freaked out this morning and
hit her. I'm at the hospital right now.

20:22.169 --> 20:23.991
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,
but you're gonna have to let that go.

20:24.088 --> 20:28.661
- It's not safe in Los Angeles today.
- Why not?

20:28.757 --> 20:32.465
- Something bad's gonna happen,
sweetheart, just trust me.
- Dad, tell me.

20:36.431 --> 20:38.413
Sweetheart, there's
a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles.

20:38.542 --> 20:40.459
It might go off today.

20:42.890 --> 20:45.737
Oh, my God.

20:45.832 --> 20:47.783
All right, um,
I'll leave, but...

20:47.911 --> 20:50.277
No "buts," Kim.
Go, now.

20:50.372 --> 20:52.899
Well, what about you, Dad?
Are you gonna meet me at Aunt Carol's?

20:53.028 --> 20:56.226
Yes. As soon as I'm finished here
at C.T.U., I'll be right there, okay?

20:56.322 --> 20:58.111
- All right.
- Kim...

20:58.206 --> 21:00.510
don't tell anybody
about this, okay?

21:00.605 --> 21:03.388
- We can't start a panic.
- Okay.

21:03.483 --> 21:06.106
- Call me as soon as you get there.
- Okay.

21:06.203 --> 21:08.985
Uh, Dad, I love you.

21:11.031 --> 21:14.259
I love you too, sweetheart.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.723
- Now go.
- Okay.

21:40.034 --> 21:42.881
George wanted me to find out
if there's anything I can do to help.

21:43.008 --> 21:45.631
No, thank you.

21:45.726 --> 21:48.061
I could fill out that boilerplate stuff
for you, if you want.

21:48.157 --> 21:50.395
Michelle, I know that George
wants me out of here.

21:50.492 --> 21:52.761
Take my advice...
don't get caught in the middle.

23:13.922 --> 23:15.744
Hello, Nina.

23:31.701 --> 23:34.675
So you weren't just
working for the Drazens.

23:34.804 --> 23:37.585
Selling information to
anybody who'd buy it:

23:37.680 --> 23:41.358
Presidential assassins,
terrorists... didn't matter.

23:45.546 --> 23:47.370
What do you know
about this nuclear bomb?

23:51.335 --> 23:53.158
Here are the terms, George.

23:53.253 --> 23:55.588
They're nonnegotiable.

23:57.156 --> 23:59.235
I'll give up my contacts...

23:59.362 --> 24:02.655
my background material,
all my intel.

24:02.751 --> 24:04.893
I'll work with whoever you want,
here or in the field.

24:04.990 --> 24:08.285
For that I want a full
presidential pardon...

24:08.413 --> 24:11.514
third-party certification,
guaranteed in writing.

24:11.610 --> 24:14.104
It's not gonna fly.

24:14.232 --> 24:16.118
Then take me back.

24:17.748 --> 24:19.955
You're not buying
a used car here.

24:20.051 --> 24:23.600
You have to deal within
the confines of reality.

24:23.696 --> 24:26.990
You're not gonna get anything
unless you produce results.

24:27.086 --> 24:30.381
It's in my interest
to produce results.

24:54.300 --> 24:57.850
Is this working?
Put me through to Chappelle at Division.

24:59.864 --> 25:02.293
She gonna help?

25:02.421 --> 25:04.691
Finish your debrief and go.

25:05.779 --> 25:08.177
Ryan, it's me.

25:08.305 --> 25:11.025
Excuse me.

25:11.121 --> 25:15.405
Sorry.

25:17.739 --> 25:21.032
So as chief
financial officer...

25:21.161 --> 25:23.688
you oversee all the money
that comes in and out of the company.

25:23.815 --> 25:26.532
- "Is that right?"
- Right.

25:26.629 --> 25:29.507
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm getting married today.

25:29.636 --> 25:31.810
So if we could just do this
another time, I'd appreciate it.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.696
Could you sit down,
please?

25:33.793 --> 25:35.776
We're not done.
Sit down.

25:40.763 --> 25:42.650
Sit down!

25:49.909 --> 25:51.924
Why don't you tell me
about Syed Ali?

25:52.051 --> 25:54.642
I told you before.
I do not know a Syed Ali.

25:54.738 --> 25:56.625
- Oh, you don't?
- No.

25:56.752 --> 26:01.709
Then how do you explain the fact that his
name is in your personal computer files?

26:14.820 --> 26:17.570
I don't know.

26:17.666 --> 26:19.552
You don't know?

26:20.894 --> 26:22.461
All right.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.451
Why don't we start again?

26:33.781 --> 26:37.108
- Where's Marie?
- She's still in her room
working on the dress.

26:38.802 --> 26:41.138
How much longer is he gonna
be in there with Reza?

26:41.234 --> 26:43.887
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't know.

26:43.983 --> 26:48.236
Dad, she's gonna find out
the second she walks out of the room.

26:48.333 --> 26:52.106
- "Are we gonna be able"
to go through with this?
- What do you mean?

26:52.234 --> 26:54.376
The wedding.

26:54.472 --> 26:56.262
Dad, it's in less
than six hours.

26:56.359 --> 26:58.789
No one's canceling anything.

27:00.164 --> 27:04.673
Just make sure Marie stays away
from these people, okay?

27:06.783 --> 27:10.652
Roger, I want you to monitor
how they use our intel.

27:11.837 --> 27:13.661
I'm not comfortable
with this.

27:15.227 --> 27:18.456
Well, we've flagged the
restricted topics, so...

27:18.551 --> 27:20.533
This should be
a one-way dialogue.

27:22.132 --> 27:24.211
Mr. President, it's Ryan Chappelle,
Division Los Angeles.

27:24.340 --> 27:26.227
Thank you.

27:26.355 --> 27:27.761
Yes, Ryan.

27:27.889 --> 27:30.127
Mr. President, I have an update
on the Nina Myers situation.

27:30.223 --> 27:32.526
She's demanding
a full presidential pardon.

27:39.496 --> 27:41.319
Here's my debrief.
It's finished.

27:41.415 --> 27:43.238
Thanks.

27:59.066 --> 28:01.723
I am supposed to
get you out of here.

28:01.818 --> 28:04.312
That's not gonna happen,
is it?

28:08.403 --> 28:10.546
It's the first time
I've seen her since...

28:15.985 --> 28:17.839
Why are you doing this
to yourself, Jack?

28:17.935 --> 28:21.100
Mason's right.
You should get out of here.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.541
- Michelle Dessler.
- Is Jack Bauer there?

28:29.670 --> 28:32.100
Yes, he is. Hold on.
Jack.

28:35.361 --> 28:37.825
Jack, it's for you.

28:40.894 --> 28:42.717
- Yeah.
- Jack Bauer?

28:42.813 --> 28:44.635
Yes.

28:44.732 --> 28:48.089
Mr. Bauer, hold one moment
for the president.

28:48.217 --> 28:50.392
- Jack?
- Mr. President.

28:50.487 --> 28:53.685
I want to thank you
for your good work this morning.

28:53.781 --> 28:56.372
Yes, sir.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.290
Jack, there's
something else...

28:58.386 --> 29:00.273
and I wanted you
to hear it from me personally.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.384
It's about Nina Myers.

29:05.166 --> 29:06.987
We're gonna have
to grant her a shadow asylum.

29:12.104 --> 29:14.631
That sounds like
a pardon, sir.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.582
It is.

29:16.678 --> 29:19.556
But only a couple of people
will ever know about it.

29:21.346 --> 29:23.168
She'll be deported
to another country.

29:26.175 --> 29:29.181
Jack, I know how difficult
this must be for you to hear.

29:29.308 --> 29:31.131
It was a painful decision.

29:31.227 --> 29:35.321
But as you know, she has information
that can help us find this bomb.

29:38.071 --> 29:39.893
I wish there was another way.

29:42.196 --> 29:44.018
So do I, sir.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.440
Let's just get through
this day.

29:47.536 --> 29:50.287
Eventually, we'll make it right.

29:51.469 --> 29:53.451
Yes, sir.

29:53.580 --> 29:55.403
Thank you, Jack.

30:03.622 --> 30:05.891
What is it?

30:17.499 --> 30:20.090
They're gonna let her go.

30:41.834 --> 30:44.073
- Hello?
- I've been trying to reach you.

30:44.169 --> 30:46.663
I had my cell off
when we were recording.

30:46.791 --> 30:49.828
- I need you.
- I really need you too.

30:49.957 --> 30:51.268
Quit it, Miguel.
I'm in trouble.

30:51.364 --> 30:53.314
What happened?
Are you okay?

30:53.441 --> 30:56.512
No, no, no. It's not me. It's Megan.
Look, you have to come help me.

30:56.608 --> 30:58.271
Help you do what?
What's going on?

30:58.367 --> 31:01.341
I can't explain it over the phone.
Just get over here, please, Miguel.

31:01.468 --> 31:03.612
I really need you.

31:03.707 --> 31:06.490
Kim, I have a whole studio
full of people here.

31:06.585 --> 31:08.854
You just have to trust me.
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

31:11.604 --> 31:15.250
- Miguel.
- Okay. Where are you?

31:45.566 --> 31:48.124
President Palmer told me
he had to take a deal with Nina.

31:49.755 --> 31:53.528
- I want the case. I know how she thinks.
- Really?

31:53.655 --> 31:55.319
Yes, and you know it.

31:56.886 --> 32:00.051
I'm not talking to you, Jack.

32:00.148 --> 32:01.970
'Cause you're not
here right now.

32:11.915 --> 32:13.802
Good. Set up here.
Have it ready to go.

32:13.897 --> 32:15.655
- Okay.
- Did you find it yet?

32:15.752 --> 32:18.887
- There's no plus-five here.
- Try the D.C. Lines
and the phone circuits.

32:20.645 --> 32:23.204
Great! Great.
Okay, skip the virus cycle.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.473
Just get these
all on-line.

32:25.569 --> 32:27.488
Michelle, I need you
to get me...

32:27.616 --> 32:29.536
all of Mason's log-in sheets
over the last 12 hours.

32:29.664 --> 32:31.837
- I need to know everywhere he's been.
- I'm sorry, Jack.

32:31.934 --> 32:33.756
- You're not cleared for that information.
- Then clear me for it.

32:33.852 --> 32:35.707
I'm right in the middle of this thing.
You know what the stakes are.

32:35.803 --> 32:37.435
What does it have
to do with George?

32:37.563 --> 32:39.959
I need to make sure
he's fit to run C.T.U.

32:40.088 --> 32:42.871
- Fit?
- I think something's happened to him.

32:42.965 --> 32:46.291
Michelle, believe it or not, I used
to run this place. I know what I'm doing.

32:46.419 --> 32:48.882
I want to help him.
Please.

32:49.010 --> 32:50.800
Get me those log-in sheets.

32:58.027 --> 33:01.257
- Can you let me know when
it's done, Cori? Thanks.
- I will.

33:01.353 --> 33:03.911
- Hi, Cori.
- Hi.

33:04.039 --> 33:07.045
I am starved, but
I don't wanna eat anything.

33:07.173 --> 33:10.593
- Well, why not?
- 'Cause the dress fits perfectly...

33:10.722 --> 33:13.568
- right now.
- Marie?

33:13.664 --> 33:16.797
- Yeah?
- There's been a little bit of a problem.

33:16.893 --> 33:18.781
Of course there's a problem.
It's a wedding. What now?

33:18.910 --> 33:21.467
- It's about Reza.
- Oh, is he backing out?

33:23.578 --> 33:25.944
What's going on?

33:26.072 --> 33:27.734
Where's Reza?

33:27.831 --> 33:29.878
He's in
the dining room.

33:30.901 --> 33:32.787
Marie.

33:35.888 --> 33:39.375
- Who are you?
- Ma'am, I'm Agent Richards
from C.T. U Los Angeles.

33:39.503 --> 33:41.966
Reza's in the room
talking to another agent.

33:42.094 --> 33:44.172
What for?
What does he want with Reza?

33:46.730 --> 33:49.575
- Dad?
- Marie, um...

33:49.672 --> 33:52.998
- I want to see Reza right now.
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I can't
let you in at this time.

33:53.125 --> 33:56.034
This is our house!
I want you out of here, now!

34:00.128 --> 34:02.111
Kate, do you know
what's going on here?

34:02.239 --> 34:04.221
- Marie, I want you to come with me.
- Why?

34:04.349 --> 34:06.237
Please.

34:11.447 --> 34:14.005
This whole thing
started with me.

34:14.134 --> 34:16.436
Please try
and understand.

34:16.532 --> 34:19.507
I saw something in the company books
that didn't check out...

34:19.635 --> 34:22.418
so I hired a private investigator
to check up on Reza.

34:22.513 --> 34:24.496
- You what?
- The private investigator...

34:24.623 --> 34:27.596
came across the name of a man
Reza's had dealings with...

34:27.724 --> 34:29.610
a man involved in
terrorist activities.

34:29.739 --> 34:31.178
What?

34:31.306 --> 34:35.176
I did it for you, Marie,
to protect you.

34:35.303 --> 34:38.214
Protect me?
All this time...

34:38.342 --> 34:40.708
you've been checking up
on Reza?

34:40.804 --> 34:42.947
Behind our backs?

34:43.043 --> 34:46.016
These people found out
something about Reza, about his past.

34:46.145 --> 34:49.022
If he's keeping something from you,
wouldn't you rather know about it now?

34:49.150 --> 34:52.348
What business is it of yours?
This is my life.

34:52.444 --> 34:55.737
How dare you interfere with it like this?
It's my wedding day!

34:55.866 --> 34:59.192
Hiring
a private investigator?

34:59.320 --> 35:00.886
That's insane, Kate.
Insane.

35:01.014 --> 35:03.252
Marie, just calm down,
okay?

35:03.349 --> 35:06.226
Look, these men are gonna be
out of here in a few minutes.

35:06.354 --> 35:09.169
All right? It's just
a big misunderstanding.

35:09.265 --> 35:10.831
Okay?

35:10.959 --> 35:14.732
Let's try to remember
that we're a family.

35:14.828 --> 35:17.705
Not anymore.
I don't want you at the wedding.

35:17.833 --> 35:19.594
- No, Marie, come on.
- No, Dad, it is unacceptable...

35:19.690 --> 35:21.257
that she did this
without telling me.

35:21.385 --> 35:24.103
Marie, I'm sorry.

35:24.199 --> 35:26.565
It was wrong of me
not to tell you first.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.225
Apology accepted.

35:35.774 --> 35:38.236
- Now get out of here.
- No.

35:38.364 --> 35:40.284
Marie.

35:59.149 --> 36:01.453
Thanks very much.

36:05.098 --> 36:06.920
Miguel, where's the car?

36:07.015 --> 36:10.119
- I let Rod take it. Why?
- We need it.

36:10.214 --> 36:12.581
- We'll take a cab.
- We can't.

36:13.699 --> 36:16.098
Kim... what's going on?

36:16.226 --> 36:19.102
- We need to get Megan out of here.
- What happened?

36:19.231 --> 36:21.088
Gary threw her to the ground.
She hit her head...

36:21.183 --> 36:24.636
and the doctors think
there's evidence of other things too.

36:24.764 --> 36:27.099
- Did you talk to the police?
- "I can't."

36:27.195 --> 36:30.103
He threatened to arrest me
for kidnapping if I said anything.

36:30.232 --> 36:33.046
- Kidnapping?
- I took her out of the house.

36:33.142 --> 36:35.349
I had to.

36:35.444 --> 36:37.810
Look, she's safe as long
as she's here at the hospital.

36:37.939 --> 36:40.784
- "You need to talk to Carla."
- It's too late for that.

36:40.881 --> 36:42.703
What do you mean?

36:45.135 --> 36:47.020
Look, you know that building
that blew up today?

36:47.148 --> 36:50.537
My father used to work there.
They go after terrorists.

36:50.666 --> 36:52.488
I talked to him
a half hour ago.

36:52.584 --> 36:55.462
He seems to think we need
to get out of L.A. As soon as possible.

36:55.590 --> 36:57.382
Why?

36:58.980 --> 37:00.867
Come here.

37:03.617 --> 37:07.422
He said there was
a nuclear bomb in the city...

37:07.550 --> 37:09.469
and he thinks
it's gonna go off today.

37:09.597 --> 37:11.452
Whoa.

37:11.548 --> 37:13.914
I know.

37:14.009 --> 37:15.641
You believe him?

37:15.801 --> 37:18.198
Yeah, I believe him.

37:20.691 --> 37:23.060
- Well, let's get out of here.
- No, we can't.

37:23.189 --> 37:25.171
Not without Megan.

37:42.951 --> 37:45.188
What are you doing in my office?

37:45.283 --> 37:47.171
How long did they give you?

37:48.450 --> 37:50.912
George, I know you were
exposed to high levels...

37:51.040 --> 37:53.726
of radioactive materials
in Panorama City this morning.

37:54.877 --> 37:56.699
How'd you figure that out?

37:56.796 --> 37:59.961
Your anti-nausea medication.
It's for radiation sickness.

38:00.057 --> 38:02.072
I checked the logs.

38:02.201 --> 38:04.119
I made a few calls.

38:04.246 --> 38:07.540
- You inaled plutonium, George.
- So?

38:07.668 --> 38:10.131
So I'm not the only person
who shouldn't be here today.

38:21.705 --> 38:24.874
How long do you have?

38:24.968 --> 38:28.262
I'll probably be dead
by this time tomorrow.

38:28.391 --> 38:30.275
Why? What's it to you?

38:31.779 --> 38:33.601
I want to know what
your plans are for Nina.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.518
As soon as we get a signature
from Palmer, she's gonna
tell us everything she knows.

38:39.646 --> 38:41.948
- Who's gonna be the handler?
- "O'Neill."

38:42.045 --> 38:44.475
Forget about O'Neill.
I wanna do it.

38:44.603 --> 38:47.162
I'm dying, Jack.
I'm not crazy.

38:47.289 --> 38:49.143
You and Nina together
is a recipe for disaster.

38:49.240 --> 38:52.981
Maybe, but if you don't do this, I'll phone
District, tell them about your condition.

38:53.076 --> 38:54.963
They'll have you replaced
within minutes.

38:55.060 --> 38:58.161
George, we want the same thing.
We want to finish this job
and find the bomb.

38:59.217 --> 39:01.102
Now, let me do it.

39:03.438 --> 39:05.293
Go ahead.

39:14.663 --> 39:16.483
I'm sorry.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.841
The ambassador's chopper
took off a few minutes ago.

39:23.937 --> 39:27.038
As soon as he gets on his plane,
he and Salim will conference...

39:27.135 --> 39:28.285
with the prime minister.

39:28.412 --> 39:30.459
How soon can we expect
the intelligence reports back?

39:30.588 --> 39:32.761
Within the hour, and then
there will be updates...

39:32.856 --> 39:35.031
every 30 minutes after that.

39:35.127 --> 39:38.422
Okay. Well, I think you better
set up a call with the Joint Chiefs.

39:38.517 --> 39:40.723
I have a feeling they're not gonna be
happy about the information exchange.

39:40.819 --> 39:42.610
I'm gonna have
to talk them through it.

39:42.706 --> 39:45.392
Right away, sir.

39:45.489 --> 39:47.375
Mr. President,
take a look at this.

39:47.470 --> 39:50.765
Internal feed from Fox News.

39:50.892 --> 39:53.643
A press conference
"was scheduled for"... "Oh, no!"

39:53.738 --> 39:57.864
- What was that?
- Look! Did you see that?

39:57.960 --> 40:00.966
Where's this? Los Angeles?

40:01.094 --> 40:03.459
No, sir. It's right here.

40:04.899 --> 40:06.498
I don't understand.

40:06.625 --> 40:08.224
It's the ambassador's chopper.

40:09.823 --> 40:12.158
It crashed
just after takeoff.

40:12.254 --> 40:16.411
You can see smoke
billowing from the area just behind me.

40:16.507 --> 40:19.704
We have no information at this time
"as to who may have been on"...

40:19.800 --> 40:22.933
First indications are
there are no survivors.

40:25.078 --> 40:28.626
" It seemed to explode"...
again, all I know is at the time...

40:28.754 --> 40:31.313
uh, the helicopter, apparently
"a military helicopter was"...

40:43.016 --> 40:44.806
Stop treating me
like a criminal!

40:51.426 --> 40:54.912
Surveillance is all hooked up
in the interrogation room, Michelle.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.789
- Mr. Bauer?
- I'm gonna have to get back to you.
