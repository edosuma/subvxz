01:47.141 --> 01:48.809
a timeless symbol of love,

01:48.842 --> 01:50.344

01:50.344 --> 01:51.879
tradition was invented less than

01:51.879 --> 01:54.081
a century ago by the De Beers

01:54.081 --> 01:55.349
Diamond Corporation.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.585
Before the 1930s, people didn't

01:57.585 --> 01:58.852
exchange diamond rings when they

01:58.852 --> 01:59.887
got engaged.

02:07.027 --> 02:07.895
devotion.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.097
Sold! Oh, I love ya, Frank!

02:10.097 --> 02:11.999
But in 1938, De Beers

02:11.999 --> 02:13.501
launched a massive ad campaign

02:13.501 --> 02:14.535
claiming that the only way for a

02:14.535 --> 02:16.103
real man to show his love is

02:16.103 --> 02:17.371
with a hunk of crystallized

02:17.371 --> 02:18.206
carbon.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.607
And we bought it.

02:19.607 --> 02:20.941
Hold on, it says if I don't

02:20.941 --> 02:21.875
buy you one of these ring

02:21.875 --> 02:22.876
dealies, then I'm a

02:24.178 --> 02:25.213
And it's on the side of

02:25.213 --> 02:27.114

02:27.114 --> 02:28.282
In fact, every part of the

02:28.282 --> 02:29.450
engagement tradition was

02:29.450 --> 02:30.684
designed to make more money

02:30.684 --> 02:31.619
for De Beers.

02:31.619 --> 02:32.720
Like, how much did you drop on

02:32.720 --> 02:33.621

02:33.621 --> 02:34.722
Four grand.

What? That's more than

02:35.723 --> 02:36.724

02:36.724 --> 02:37.725
My dad said the rule was two

02:37.725 --> 02:38.526
months' salary.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.960
Dude, that's not a rule.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.362

03:42.256 --> 03:43.291
Hi, Adam.

03:43.291 --> 03:43.957
He's a journalist who's

03:43.957 --> 03:44.692
written about the De Beers

03:44.692 --> 03:45.659
diamond cartel for over 30

03:45.659 --> 03:46.627
years, and he's the foremost

03:46.627 --> 03:47.628
expert on the subject.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.496
Well, crud.

03:48.496 --> 03:49.630
Have you ever tired

03:49.630 --> 03:51.632
to sell a diamond?

03:51.632 --> 03:53.467
Well, I have.

03:53.501 --> 03:54.468
When I was writing my book,

03:54.468 --> 03:55.969
I took a diamond that someone

03:55.969 --> 03:58.105
had paid $6,000 for

03:58.105 --> 03:58.839
the day before,

03:58.839 --> 04:00.140
and I took it from one

04:00.140 --> 04:01.509
diamond store to another

04:01.509 --> 04:03.176
diamond store in New York.

04:03.210 --> 04:04.545
And you know what I was offered?

04:04.545 --> 04:06.447
Less than $1,000.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.315
I know that, 'cause I read

04:07.315 --> 04:07.981
the book, so...

04:07.981 --> 04:09.550
That diamond had lost

04:09.550 --> 04:11.218
five-sixths of its value

04:11.218 --> 04:12.953
overnight.

04:12.953 --> 04:13.887
So, diamonds aren't a great

04:13.887 --> 04:16.490
investment per se?

04:16.490 --> 04:17.558
Face it, kid.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.493
You got ripped off.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.328
Thanks, Ed.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.061
Aah!

04:21.061 --> 04:22.062
The thing is, diamonds aren't

04:22.062 --> 04:23.230
rare at all.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.865
In fact, they're quite common.

04:24.865 --> 04:25.999
The only reason diamonds are

04:25.999 --> 04:27.801
even expensive is that De Beers

04:27.801 --> 04:29.503
has a global monopoly on diamond

04:29.503 --> 04:31.171
mining and they artificially

04:31.171 --> 04:32.806
restrict the supply to jack

04:32.806 --> 04:34.007
the prices up.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.976
But in reality, those (bleep)

04:35.976 --> 04:38.479
have a (bleep) ton of them.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.382
These are extremely rare.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.354
Pay no attention to that.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.321
And that's why De Beers

04:47.321 --> 04:48.389
wants us to think a diamond

04:48.389 --> 04:49.523
is forever.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.424
As long as we never try to

04:50.424 --> 04:51.258
sell them, we'll never figure

04:51.258 --> 04:54.528

06:53.981 --> 06:55.549

06:55.549 --> 06:56.684
But the real owner of TOMS

06:56.684 --> 06:58.686
is a guy named Blake Mycoskie.

06:58.686 --> 06:59.853
And as noble as Blake's

06:59.853 --> 07:01.722
intentions may be, the "Buy one,

07:01.722 --> 07:03.356

07:03.356 --> 07:04.725

07:36.924 --> 07:38.225
It's not common knowledge, but

07:38.225 --> 07:39.760
before Blake founded TOMS shoes,

07:39.760 --> 07:41.094
he was a reality star who

07:41.094 --> 07:42.563
appeared on "The Amazing Race"

07:42.563 --> 07:44.397
and Fox's "Sexiest Bachelor

07:44.397 --> 07:45.733
in America" pageant,

07:45.733 --> 07:46.600
where he gave away something

07:46.600 --> 07:48.235
even more valuable than shoes--

07:48.235 --> 07:49.503
dat ass.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.738
Really?

07:50.738 --> 07:51.872
Whoa.

07:51.872 --> 07:52.706
But while on a trip to

07:52.706 --> 07:54.174
Argentina, Blake saw the

07:54.174 --> 07:55.743
devastating effects of poverty

07:55.743 --> 07:58.045
with his own piercing blue eyes.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.179
And he decided then and

07:59.179 --> 08:00.748
there to devote his life

08:00.748 --> 08:02.750
to helping the needy...

08:02.750 --> 08:04.752
by giving them shoes.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.920
Yeah, he's a generous guy.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.622
Is he? Is it generous

08:08.622 --> 08:09.456
to give people something

08:09.456 --> 08:10.591
they don't want or need?

08:10.591 --> 08:11.391
What are you talking about?

08:11.391 --> 08:12.092
People in those countries

08:12.092 --> 08:13.260
need shoes.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.528
Do they?

08:14.528 --> 08:16.096
Yeah...

08:16.096 --> 08:17.464
How do you know?

08:17.464 --> 08:19.366
I don't know, uh...

08:19.366 --> 08:20.300
When I picture someone in

08:20.300 --> 08:21.802
Africa, I imagine them living in

08:21.802 --> 08:23.604
a village, you know, with no

08:23.604 --> 08:26.439
shoes and no clothes and...

08:26.439 --> 08:28.308
They live in this cute little

08:28.308 --> 08:30.410
hut with an elephant and

08:30.410 --> 08:31.879
everyone's always playing music

08:31.879 --> 08:32.880
and walking around with water

08:32.880 --> 08:35.783
jugs on their heads and...

08:35.783 --> 08:36.950
Oh, my God, this is

08:36.950 --> 08:38.118
condescending, isn't it?

08:38.118 --> 08:39.119
Tell you what, why don't we

08:39.119 --> 08:41.054
just ask someone from Africa?

08:41.054 --> 08:41.855
Yeah, we should prob...

08:41.889 --> 08:43.056

Hey, Teddy, how's it going?

I want you to meet

08:46.293 --> 08:47.595
my friend Emily.

08:47.595 --> 08:48.996
Um, do you have shoes

08:48.996 --> 08:50.130
in Uganda?

08:50.130 --> 08:51.799
Surprisingly, yes,

08:51.799 --> 08:52.800
we do have shoes.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.267
We also have shoe stores,

08:54.267 --> 08:56.069
and we also have cobblers.

08:56.069 --> 08:56.970
But what about those TOMS

08:56.970 --> 08:58.405
ads, you know, with, with all

08:58.405 --> 08:59.740
the videos of the shoeless

08:59.740 --> 09:00.908
children?

09:00.908 --> 09:02.142
That's what we call

09:02.142 --> 09:03.476
"poverty porn."

09:03.476 --> 09:05.145
They find the most extreme

09:05.145 --> 09:07.114
situations and make it look

09:07.114 --> 09:09.182
like the most common situation

09:09.182 --> 09:10.417
on the continent.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.484
Shoes is the least of our

09:11.484 --> 09:13.286
problems, really, guys.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.287
We're worried about malaria.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.488
We're worried about getting

09:15.488 --> 09:17.190
jobs, we're just worried about

09:17.190 --> 09:18.659
having electricity in the

09:18.659 --> 09:19.927
village, for example.

09:19.927 --> 09:20.961
Well, if those kids don't

09:20.961 --> 09:22.095
need free shoes, why did they

09:22.095 --> 09:23.496
take them in the first place?

09:23.496 --> 09:24.932
A kid doesn't understand

09:24.932 --> 09:26.099
the ramifications of me

09:26.099 --> 09:27.668
receiving these free shoes

09:27.668 --> 09:29.036
from somebody in America.

09:29.036 --> 09:29.970
Like what kind of

09:30.003 --> 09:31.038
ramifications?

09:31.038 --> 09:31.872
Well, what it does is

09:31.872 --> 09:33.006
actually put people who are

09:33.006 --> 09:34.642
creating shoes right out of

09:34.642 --> 09:35.609
business.

09:35.609 --> 09:36.944
It takes way the agency of the

09:36.944 --> 09:37.978
community to be

09:37.978 --> 09:38.846
self-sustaining.

09:38.846 --> 09:39.947
Yeah, one study showed that

09:39.947 --> 09:41.114
free clothing donations to

09:41.114 --> 09:42.683
Africa reduced employment in

09:42.683 --> 09:44.652
their garment industry by half.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.286
Am I clay?

09:46.286 --> 09:47.387
And here's the kicker.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.056
The shoes TOMS gives away cost

09:49.056 --> 09:51.558
them only four dollars to make.

09:51.558 --> 09:54.561
But wait, they cost 60.

09:54.561 --> 09:55.996
So, if I get a pair of

09:55.996 --> 09:57.330
four-dollar shoes and they

09:57.330 --> 09:59.032
give away a pair of four-dollar

09:59.032 --> 10:00.233
shoes, where do

10:00.233 --> 10:01.534
the other 52

10:01.534 --> 10:03.236
dollars go?

10:03.236 --> 10:06.473
(zap, whoosh)

10:06.473 --> 10:08.475
Look, TOMS may kind of act

10:08.475 --> 10:09.542
like they're a charity,

10:09.542 --> 10:10.377
but they're a for-profit

10:10.377 --> 10:11.745
company.

10:11.745 --> 10:12.746
And last year, Blake sold his

10:12.746 --> 10:14.181
stake in TOMS in a deal that

10:14.181 --> 10:17.350
valued them at $600 million.

Oh, no, look, corporations

good in the world.

Like, when they contribute to

10:23.724 --> 10:24.725

Mass blood drives became an

American civic tradition during

11:49.777 --> 11:51.311

13:20.667 --> 13:23.503
or bold and spicy?

13:23.503 --> 13:26.373
Original, they're not fancy.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.875
Okay, but they're still

13:27.875 --> 13:29.709
chipping in free food.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.711
Yeah, dream on, lady.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.346
Free? Somebody has to pay to

13:33.346 --> 13:34.447
haul all of this stuff

13:34.447 --> 13:35.682
to a warehouse.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.284
Oh, oh, my God...

13:37.284 --> 13:38.551
And someone has to sort and

13:38.551 --> 13:41.388
throw out all the expired cans.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.623
And plus, canned food is high

13:43.623 --> 13:45.258
in sodium, which causes

13:45.258 --> 13:46.994
high blood pressure.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.863
Ahh!

13:49.863 --> 13:51.231
Well, that's an exaggeration.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.232
Your heart wouldn't literally

13:52.232 --> 13:53.901
explode-- great work, Tony--

13:53.901 --> 13:55.702
but it is true that nearly half

13:55.702 --> 13:57.204
the food we donate doesn't meet

13:57.204 --> 13:58.638
basic nutritional standards.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.873
Okay, so what kind of food

13:59.873 --> 14:01.441
do pantries need?

14:01.441 --> 14:02.209
I don't know,

14:02.209 --> 14:03.376
what do you eat?

14:03.376 --> 14:05.445
Me? Oh, well..

14:05.445 --> 14:06.146
(clearing throat)

14:06.146 --> 14:07.214
I really like fruits and

14:07.214 --> 14:09.282
veggies, I eat a lot of salads.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.051
Oh, and I try to eat lean meats,

14:11.051 --> 14:12.953
you know, chicken and turkey and

14:12.953 --> 14:14.321
stuff like that, and...

14:14.321 --> 14:16.957
Oh, I just love a loaf of fresh,

14:16.957 --> 14:17.991
crusty bread.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.792
Exactly, but you can't donate

14:19.792 --> 14:20.928
any of those foods because

14:20.928 --> 14:22.262
they're all perishable.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.330
Genevieve, would you tell Emily

14:23.330 --> 14:24.631
why canned food drives suck?

14:24.631 --> 14:26.233
Canned food drives don't

14:26.233 --> 14:28.235
suck, but they're not the most

14:28.235 --> 14:29.236
efficient way to give.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.637
Oh, you run a food bank,

14:30.637 --> 14:32.639
don't you? Yeah, I do.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.641
And at our food bank, we have a

14:34.641 --> 14:36.276
lot of canned food drives, but

14:36.276 --> 14:37.610
they're a whole lot of work.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.811
And sometimes we have to throw

14:38.811 --> 14:40.413
away food, and there's some cost

14:40.413 --> 14:41.814
involved in that.

14:41.814 --> 14:42.682
But there are benefits,

14:42.682 --> 14:43.516
right?

14:43.516 --> 14:44.251
Well, yeah, I mean,

14:44.251 --> 14:45.485
one of the things that's great

14:45.485 --> 14:46.486
is it can help children

14:46.486 --> 14:47.520
connect to giving.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.488
Maybe they'll go out and shop

14:48.488 --> 14:49.990
for their favorite canned food

14:49.990 --> 14:51.758
or soup and knowing that another

14:51.758 --> 14:53.026
child is gonna get it really

14:53.026 --> 14:54.327
helps to make that connection

14:54.327 --> 14:55.162
with giving.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.263
Oh, that sounds like

14:56.263 --> 14:57.197
a good thing.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.531
Okay, all right, fair point,

14:58.531 --> 15:00.267
fair point, but...

15:00.267 --> 15:02.135
The truth is the best way to

15:02.135 --> 15:03.803
help a food bank is to donate

15:03.803 --> 15:05.838
money, because we buy food on

15:05.838 --> 15:07.607
a wholesale level, and we work

15:07.607 --> 15:09.609
with farmers, so we can take the

15:09.609 --> 15:11.144
dollar that you might spend on a

15:11.144 --> 15:13.113
single can of beans and turn it

15:13.113 --> 15:15.482
into exponentially more food.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.683
Hey, there, folks.

15:16.683 --> 15:17.850
I got a delivery here

15:17.850 --> 15:21.054
for one dollar's worth of food.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.656
I mean, comically large amount

15:23.656 --> 15:25.292
of food.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.960
I get it, but I like the

15:26.960 --> 15:27.961
canned food drive.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.462
It brings the community together

15:29.462 --> 15:31.031
and everyone feels good...

15:31.031 --> 15:32.499
Yeah, but those are all ways

15:32.499 --> 15:33.700
in which the canned food drive

15:33.700 --> 15:34.801
helps you, not the people

15:34.801 --> 15:36.003
who need it.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.570
That's not generosity.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.507
That's selfishness.

15:40.507 --> 15:41.408
Has anyone ever told you

15:41.408 --> 15:44.144
you're a little abrasive?

15:44.144 --> 15:45.878
Yeah, like all the time.

15:45.878 --> 15:49.316
Oh, wow.

15:49.316 --> 15:52.885
Oh, oh, wow.

15:52.885 --> 15:56.089
♪♪

15:56.089 --> 15:57.357
Everything is wrong in here.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.358
(laughing)

15:58.358 --> 16:00.360
Come on, dude.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.561
90% of what's collected

16:01.561 --> 16:03.096
by coat drives is recycled

16:03.096 --> 16:04.231
for scrap.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.532
A lot of the people who get free

16:05.532 --> 16:07.334
farm animals just sell them.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.601
You know what relief groups call

16:08.601 --> 16:09.936
the deluge of unneeded supplies

16:09.936 --> 16:11.404
we send to disaster areas?

16:11.404 --> 16:12.072
No.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.673
"The second disaster."

16:13.673 --> 16:14.674
Fascinating.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.276
Oh, and finally...

16:16.276 --> 16:18.278
soda can pull tabs.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.512
People all over America collect

16:19.512 --> 16:21.181
them for charity, which is

16:21.181 --> 16:22.849
weird, because they're totally

16:22.849 --> 16:23.683
worthless.

16:23.683 --> 16:24.351
Really?

16:24.351 --> 16:25.952
Yeah, sorry, kid,

16:25.952 --> 16:27.287
it's an urban myth.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.189
Wasted all my time on this!

16:29.189 --> 16:30.957
Why?! Why?!

16:30.957 --> 16:33.260
So dumb! Why?!

16:33.260 --> 16:35.362
(continues shouting)

16:35.362 --> 16:36.696
Why?!

16:36.696 --> 16:37.530
Should we...?

16:37.530 --> 16:38.365
Nah, you just gotta

16:38.365 --> 16:39.099
wait it out.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.901
So dumb! Who cares?!

16:41.901 --> 16:45.072
Oh, poor Degbert.

16:45.072 --> 16:45.972
(sighs)

16:45.972 --> 16:47.707
So, what's your message?

16:47.707 --> 16:48.875
Giving is bad?

16:48.875 --> 16:50.377
No, giving is wonderful.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.611
I just think that we can all

16:51.611 --> 16:52.279
give better.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.646
And there actually is one

16:53.646 --> 16:56.783
single, simple best way to give.

16:56.783 --> 16:57.884
Why didn't you lead with

16:57.884 --> 16:59.986
that? What is it?

16:59.986 --> 17:00.820
Well, if we--

17:00.820 --> 17:01.488
Wait, Adam.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.222
Hey, we gotta go to commercial.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.423
Save it for act four.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.324
Can you do me a big favor and

17:04.324 --> 17:05.225
look right in camera and give

17:05.225 --> 17:06.993
me a "We'll be right back?"

17:06.993 --> 17:08.761
Seriously?

17:08.761 --> 17:10.963
We'll be right back.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.132
Apparently.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.233
Great job.

17:15.568 --> 17:16.969
Okay, everybody, listen up.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.571
The way you're giving is wrong.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.440
But don't worry, me and Emily

17:20.440 --> 17:21.308
are gonna tell you how

17:21.308 --> 17:23.110
to fix it.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.177
Okay, smart guy,

17:24.177 --> 17:25.478
what's the big secret?

17:25.478 --> 17:26.146
What should we give?

17:26.146 --> 17:27.414
(baby crying)

17:27.414 --> 17:28.848
Simple, the one gift that

17:28.848 --> 17:30.283
costs nothing to ship and that

17:30.283 --> 17:31.518
everybody needs.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.121
The single most empowering gift

17:34.121 --> 17:36.289
ever invented...

17:36.289 --> 17:37.457
Money.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.292
(booing)

17:39.292 --> 17:40.527
Ridiculous.

17:40.527 --> 17:41.328
You're gonna wheel in

17:41.328 --> 17:42.295
an expert, aren't you?

17:42.295 --> 17:43.163
Ooh, yeah, that's a good

17:43.163 --> 17:43.996
idea, yeah, yeah.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.432
Wheel him in, John.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.799
Please welcome Sophal Ear,

17:46.799 --> 17:48.335
Associate Professor of Diplomacy

17:48.335 --> 17:49.302
and World Affairs at

17:49.302 --> 17:51.070
Occidental College.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.038
So, I'm just trying to explain

17:52.038 --> 17:53.140
to all these folks what

17:53.140 --> 17:54.374
the most effective form

17:54.374 --> 17:55.275
of charity giving is.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.042
Would you mind telling them

17:56.042 --> 17:57.277
what you told me?

17:57.277 --> 17:58.211
If you really wanna help

17:58.211 --> 17:59.712
people, if you really wanna make

17:59.712 --> 18:01.047
a difference, the best way is to

18:01.047 --> 18:03.650
give money directly.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.784
(disappointed chatter)

18:04.784 --> 18:05.785
You can't just give poor

18:05.785 --> 18:06.719
people money.

18:06.719 --> 18:07.787
What if they waste it on things

18:07.787 --> 18:09.156
they don't need?

18:09.156 --> 18:11.158
Yeah, or buy unhealthy food?

18:11.158 --> 18:13.160
Or spend it on alcohol?

18:13.160 --> 18:14.327
No, that way of thinking

18:14.327 --> 18:15.995
is totally misguided.

18:15.995 --> 18:16.829
Lots of studies across the

18:16.829 --> 18:18.398
board have shown that money

18:18.398 --> 18:19.666
allows people to buy the things

18:19.666 --> 18:21.168
they need and helps local

18:21.168 --> 18:22.169
economies.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.503
People do spend money on selfish

18:23.503 --> 18:25.004
things, but usually those

18:25.004 --> 18:26.339
selfish things make them better

18:26.339 --> 18:27.674
off, and it could be things

18:27.674 --> 18:29.041
like, uh, their business or

18:29.041 --> 18:31.077
their, uh, children's education

18:31.077 --> 18:32.512
or their health care.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.013
It's like, give a man a fish,

18:34.013 --> 18:35.215
he eats for a day.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.549
Teach a man to fish and he eats

18:36.549 --> 18:37.750
for a lifetime.

18:37.750 --> 18:38.851
But give a man cash,

18:38.851 --> 18:39.919
and he can buy some apples.

18:39.919 --> 18:40.887
He can take a cooking class.

18:40.887 --> 18:41.821
I don't know, maybe he doesn't

18:41.821 --> 18:42.589
like fish.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.523
Who are you to tell him

18:43.523 --> 18:44.591
what to eat?

18:44.591 --> 18:45.492
Let me get this straight,

18:45.492 --> 18:46.326
egghead.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.260
Instead of donating canned food,

18:47.260 --> 18:48.228
we should do what?

18:48.228 --> 18:49.262
(baby crying)

18:49.262 --> 18:50.230
Maybe give money to your

18:50.230 --> 18:51.264
local food bank.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.432
Okay, but what do we do

18:52.432 --> 18:53.600
instead of donating clothes

18:53.600 --> 18:54.534
to Africa?

18:54.534 --> 18:55.768
You could donate to a direct

18:55.768 --> 18:57.204
giving organization.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.238
There are lots of them.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.539
You can search for them online.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.740
And what are we supposed

19:00.740 --> 19:01.708
to do instead of buying

19:01.708 --> 19:02.942
engagement rings?

19:02.942 --> 19:03.610
You could take the money

19:03.610 --> 19:04.711
and put it into a retirement

19:04.711 --> 19:05.712
account... if your fiancée's

19:05.712 --> 19:07.046
good with that.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.080
Mm, she's not-- just get

19:08.080 --> 19:09.048
a sapphire, it's cheaper,

19:09.048 --> 19:10.383
more ethical, I get a ring.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.352
You got it, babe.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.220
So, what you're saying

19:13.220 --> 19:14.787
is this wonderful

19:14.787 --> 19:17.224
community event...

19:17.224 --> 19:19.526
is a complete waste of time.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.060
What we should really do is shut

19:21.060 --> 19:23.396
it down and write a check.

19:23.396 --> 19:24.764
(baby crying)

19:24.764 --> 19:25.765
Yeah, that would be the

19:25.765 --> 19:26.899
rational thing to do.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.068
(baby crying)

19:29.068 --> 19:30.370
(all shouting)

19:30.370 --> 19:31.103
What?! What are you,

19:31.103 --> 19:32.138
what are you doing?!

19:32.138 --> 19:34.974
Ah, oh, guh-- oh, they did

19:34.974 --> 19:36.309
not take that well.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.477
Well, you can be pretty

19:37.477 --> 19:38.545
abrasive, Adam.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.646
Thanks, Sophal.

19:39.646 --> 19:40.647
Gosh, sheesh...

19:40.647 --> 19:41.381
Thank you, bye.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.982
Bye.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.918
Hey, Adam, uh...

19:45.918 --> 19:47.086

19:47.086 --> 19:48.255
I actually did learn something.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.722
Wait, really?

19:49.722 --> 19:50.457
Yeah, it was pretty

19:50.457 --> 19:52.325
interesting.

W... well, you know, in that

Not an invitation for more.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.096
It's time to go.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.765
You're right.

19:58.765 --> 20:01.968
I'm afraid I'm needed elsewhere.

20:07.740 --> 20:08.741
I ride a folding bike.

It's much more efficient.

"Adam Ruins Everything,"

how your purebred puppy's

is pesticide residue.
