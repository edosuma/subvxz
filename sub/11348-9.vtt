announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:10.078 --> 00:12.380
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.782
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.815 --> 00:16.617
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.650 --> 00:18.252
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:18.286 --> 00:20.254
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.423
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:46.314 --> 00:49.283
- DON'T!

00:49.317 --> 00:50.784
SORRY, SORRY.
IT'S COMING BACK TO ME.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.253
I TURNED.
HE WAS THERE.

00:52.286 --> 00:53.454
I SAID, "DON'T."

00:53.487 --> 00:55.389
- IT'S OKAY, HONEY.
IT'S OKAY.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.757
- DO I HAVE TO DO THIS?

00:56.790 --> 00:58.692
- WE KNOW THIS IS HARD,
BUT YOU JUST SAID

00:58.726 --> 01:00.461
THE DETAILS
ARE COMING BACK TO YOU.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.496
- AND THAT'S WHY YOU DO THESE--

01:02.530 --> 01:04.332
- COGNITIVE REENACTMENTS.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.267
NOW, YOU TOLD US
AT THE HOSPITAL

01:06.300 --> 01:08.136
THAT YOU DIDN'T GET
A GOOD LOOK AT HIM.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.503
DO YOU REMEMBER MORE NOW?

01:09.537 --> 01:12.440
- NO.
IT WAS STILL DARK.

01:12.473 --> 01:15.676
HE PUT HIS HAND
OVER MY MOUTH.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.211
HE HAD ON GLOVES.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.347
- GLOVES?
LIKE, WINTER GLOVES?

01:19.380 --> 01:23.317
- NO, RUBBERY, THIN
MEDICAL GLOVES.

01:23.351 --> 01:25.686
- OKAY, THAT COULD BE HELPFUL.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.755
ALL RIGHT, ANNIE.
SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

01:27.788 --> 01:30.624
- UM...HE PUSHED ME
INSIDE THE RESTAURANT.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.328
OVER THERE.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.332
BUT I BARELY SAW HIS FACE.

01:38.366 --> 01:39.433
I'M SORRY.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.834
- IS ANYTHING ELSE COMING BACK?

01:40.868 --> 01:43.504
THE WAY HE SMELLED.
THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.206
- YEAH...

01:45.239 --> 01:49.310
UNDER HIS BREATH,
HE WAS HUMMING.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.179
- HUMMING?

01:51.212 --> 01:52.846
HUMMING WHAT?

01:52.880 --> 01:55.416
- CHURCH MUSIC?

01:55.449 --> 01:58.286
THEN I-I FELT HIS HAND
ON MY NECK.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.753
I MUST'VE PASSED OUT.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.655
- HE PUT YOU OUT, ANNIE.

02:01.689 --> 02:05.659
YOUR EXAM SHOWED A BRUISE
ON YOUR CAROTID ARTERY.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.595
- YOU TOLD US YESTERDAY,
WHEN YOU CAME TO,

02:07.628 --> 02:09.430
HE WAS STILL HERE?

02:09.463 --> 02:11.332
- PULLING HIMSELF OFF ME.

02:11.365 --> 02:15.336
HE SAID,
"NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

02:15.369 --> 02:18.272
MAYBE WE'LL HAVE TEA SOON."

02:18.306 --> 02:21.209
[sniffling]
AND THEN HE WALKED OUT.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.444
HE TOLD ME NOT TO LOOK,
BUT I PEEKED.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.346
- YOU SEE WHICH WAY HE WENT?

02:25.379 --> 02:27.548
- AROUND THAT CORNER.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.583
I WATCHED HIM
UNTIL HE WAS GONE.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.187
WAIT, SOMETHING ELSE--
UM...

02:33.221 --> 02:34.855
I SAW HIM TAKE OFF HIS GLOVES.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.259
- THAT COULD BE IMPORTANT,
ANNIE.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.428
THANK YOU.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.330
YOU GOT HER?

02:42.363 --> 02:45.899
OKAY, SO WE'LL CALL CSU,
HAVE THEM COMB THE STREET.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.336
MAYBE WE'LL GET LUCKY,
FIND THOSE GLOVES,

02:48.369 --> 02:49.937
GET SOME TOUCH DNA.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.339
- MAYBE, LIV.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.774
THIS GUY STALKED HER,
WORE A CONDOM,

02:53.807 --> 02:55.243
KNEW HOW TO MAKE HER PASS OUT.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.245
WE'RE LOOKING AT A PRO.
- OH, I KNOW.

02:57.278 --> 03:00.581
I ALSO KNOW THAT HE'S GONNA
DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN

03:00.614 --> 03:02.716
UNTIL WE FIND HIM.

03:08.756 --> 03:11.725
[dramatic music]

03:56.804 --> 03:57.271
.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.306
- GLOVE THEY FOUND IN
THE SEWER GRATE CAME BACK CLEAN.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.674
NO DNA. NO PRINTS.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.576
- NO DNA?
WELL, THERE GOES CODIS.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.012
- LOOK, IT WAS WORTH A SHOT.
WE THINK THE PERP KNEW HER, SO--

04:05.045 --> 04:09.049
- SO WE RE-CANVASS THE AREA,
VIDEO CAMS, PARKING TICKETS,

04:09.082 --> 04:10.784
I CROSSCHECK THE TEA SHOP'S
CREDIT CARD RECEIPTS

04:10.818 --> 04:11.885
WITH KNOWN OFFENDERS--
I KNOW THE DRILL.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.354
- FANTASTIC.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.523
- HEY, SORRY I'M LATE.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.426
CON ED WAS ON MY BLOCK.
THE TRANSFORMER WAS OUT.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.893
SO NO ELECTRICITY,
NO HOT WATER.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.562
I HAD TO TAKE A SHOWER
AT THE GYM.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.397
IT WAS--
- ROLLINS, A WORD OF ADVICE.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.566
WHEN YOU'RE COMING UP
WITH AN EXCUSE, DON'T OVERSELL.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.000
- COPY THAT.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.570
- THE PERP WORE LATEX GLOVES.
WE THINK HE STALKED HER.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.004
- OKAY, SO YOU PUT IT
INTO VICAP?

04:31.038 --> 04:32.506
- YOU DID, RIGHT?

04:32.540 --> 04:33.874
- YOU HAVE A DETAILED M.O.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.677
I MEAN, VICAP IS A COMPREHENSIVE
NATIONWIDE DATABASE.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.911
- YEAH, I KNOW.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.079
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO GET INTO THAT.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.581
- OKAY, EARLY SUNDAY,

04:40.614 --> 04:42.950
A CAUCASIAN MALE
ASSAULTS ANNIE LIN.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.885
NOW, SHE'S YOUNG.
SHE IS ASIAN.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.888
HE CHOKES HER
AND USES LATEX GLOVES.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.457
WHAT ELSE?
- HE HUMMED.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.858
- HE WHAT?
- HE HUMMED.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.760
- ANNIE REMEMBERED
THE PERP HUMMING

04:52.793 --> 04:53.994
WHILE HE ASSAULTED HER.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.029
- HE HUMMED?
- SO HE'S MUSICAL.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.965
- YOU MIGHT THINK I'M CRAZY,
BUT WAS IT--

04:57.998 --> 04:58.966
WAS IT GOSPEL MUSIC?

04:58.999 --> 05:01.502
- ANNIE SAID IT SOUNDED
LIKE A CHURCH HYMN.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.504
- BEFORE I LEFT ATLANTA,

05:03.537 --> 05:06.640
WE HAD A HUMMING RAPIST
THAT CHOKED OUT HIS VICS.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.941
I MEAN, IT WASN'T MY CASE,

05:07.975 --> 05:11.044
BUT IT WAS ONLY BACK IN 2008? 9?
[phone beeps]

05:11.078 --> 05:13.481
- OKAY, WELL, ATLANTA'S AN EASY
CALL FOR YOU, RIGHT?

05:13.514 --> 05:14.948
SO...

05:14.982 --> 05:16.684
CARISI, SINCE YOU WERE
GONNA DO IT ANYWAY--

05:16.717 --> 05:18.051
HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE OVER VICAP?

05:18.085 --> 05:20.954
CHECK RECENTLY RELEASED
PAROLEES, OFFENDERS, OKAY?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.523
THIS GUY HAD TO COME
FROM SOMEWHERE.

05:22.556 --> 05:25.593
- AND HE MAY NOT
HAVE GONE ANYWHERE.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.995
16-YEAR-OLD
AT THE MIDTOWN MAGNET SCHOOL

05:28.028 --> 05:30.431
JUST DISCLOSED
TO HER COUNSELOR,

05:30.464 --> 05:33.467
EARLY MORNING,
A GUY CHOKED HER OUT.

05:39.039 --> 05:42.443
- I GOT UP TO MOVE
MY MOTHER'S CAR,

05:42.476 --> 05:44.678
LOOKING FOR A TUESDAY SPACE.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.982
- OKAY.
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

05:49.016 --> 05:52.653
- UM, A MAN GRABBED ME
FROM BEHIND.

05:54.922 --> 05:58.426
HE HAD LATEX GLOVES ON.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.662
- I TRIED TO FIGHT, BUT, UM...

06:01.695 --> 06:03.831
HE WAS BIGGER THAN ME.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.434
- IT'S OKAY, NINA.
IT'S OKAY.

06:08.068 --> 06:11.605
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD--
YOU COULD DESCRIBE HIM FOR ME?

06:11.639 --> 06:14.908
- UH...NOT VERY WELL.

06:14.942 --> 06:18.479
HE WAS WHITE, STRONG...

06:19.947 --> 06:22.516
HE GRABBED ME BY THE NECK.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.084
I BLACKED OUT.

06:26.654 --> 06:29.657
WHEN I CAME TO,
I WAS LYING BEHIND A DUMPSTER.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.762
HE TOLD ME I SHOULD GET UP
AND MOVE THE CAR

06:34.795 --> 06:36.964
SO MY MOTHER WOULDN'T
GET A TICKET.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.600
- HE'D BEEN WATCHING YOU.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.168
YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE HIM?

06:41.201 --> 06:43.671
- NO.
I'M SORRY.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.473
I NEVER GOT A GOOD LOOK AT HIM.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.609
I WAS FACEDOWN.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.043
- IT'S OKAY.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.946
NINA, DID HE SAY ANYTHING ELSE?

06:52.980 --> 06:55.883
DID HE MAKE ANY NOISE?

06:56.984 --> 06:59.119
- NO.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.221
OH, WAIT, YES.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.657
UM...

07:03.691 --> 07:06.860
HE WAS HUMMING.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.997
- WHAT KIND OF SONG?

07:10.030 --> 07:13.634
- LIKE, UM...
A HYMN, MAYBE?

07:13.667 --> 07:16.003
I DON'T KNOW.
WE'RE NOT RELIGIOUS.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.676
- SO I'M GOING OVER
THESE VICAP RESPONSES.

07:22.710 --> 07:26.246
YOU KNOW HOW MANY RAPISTS
SING, HUM, OR WHISTLE

07:26.279 --> 07:27.515
TO THEIR VICTIMS?

07:27.548 --> 07:29.249
- MM-MMM.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.918
- A LOT.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.952
YOU GOT ANYTHING?

07:31.985 --> 07:33.954
- PROBATION, NO.
IMMIGRATION, NO.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.956
AND THE MILITARY HASN'T GOTTEN
BACK TO US YET.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.991
[phone chiming]
- OH, BIG SURPRISE.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.159
- [clears throat]

07:39.192 --> 07:41.495
- YOU OKAY?
[ringing continues]

07:41.529 --> 07:44.498
- YEAH, IT'S--
IT'S ATLANTA.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.999
CAPTAIN REYNOLDS,
THANK YOU FOR CALLING BACK.

07:48.168 --> 07:51.104
NO, IT'S BUSINESS.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.140
- HEY, YOU GUYS GET ANYTHING
FROM THE NEW VIC?

07:53.173 --> 07:55.075
- SHE REMEMBERED
THE LATEX GLOVES

07:55.108 --> 07:56.176
AND THE HUMMING.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.245
NO DNA.
DIDN'T SEE THE FACE.

07:58.278 --> 08:01.014
THIS GUY TARGETS HIS VICS.
HE KNOWS THEIR ROUTINES.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.216
- ANY MATCHES ON VICAP?
- YEAH, TOO MANY.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.685
YOU KNOW,
UNLESS THIS GUY WORKED

08:04.718 --> 08:06.086
EVERY CITY IN THE COUNTRY,

08:06.119 --> 08:07.688
THEN I GOT TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO NARROW MY SEARCH.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.289
- WITHOUT DNA,
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.091
- OKAY, THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.162
THERE'S THREE OPEN CASES
IN ATLANTA, SAME MO.

08:15.195 --> 08:18.766
I MEAN, THE LATEX GLOVES,
THE HUMMING, THE CHOKING OUT.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.701
AND THEY DID THE RAPE KITS
ON ALL THREE OF THEM

08:20.734 --> 08:21.935
BUT THEY NEVER HAD THEM TESTED.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.236
- OH, NOT THAT AGAIN.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.938
ARE THEY TESTING THEM NOW?

08:24.972 --> 08:27.941
- [laughs]
THEY THINK THEY'RE IN STORAGE.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.309
- ALONG WITH WHAT?
THOUSANDS OF OTHERS?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.078
- YEAH, BUT THEY'RE LOOKING
AT LEAST, RIGHT?

08:31.111 --> 08:34.014
- OH, AND NOT VERY HARD.
THESE CASES ARE SIX YEARS COLD.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.717
- WELL, OURS AREN'T.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.985
ROLLINS, IF I SEND YOU
DOWN THERE,

08:38.018 --> 08:39.553
DO YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK?

08:39.587 --> 08:41.088
- IT'S STILL A BOYS CLUB
DOWN THERE,

08:41.121 --> 08:44.324
BUT IF I ACT HELPLESS
AND BAT MY EYELASHES...

08:44.357 --> 08:46.594
- SO, DO THAT.
- HOW ABOUT I GO WITH?

08:46.627 --> 08:48.996
- HOW ABOUT...YOU TAKE FIN.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.699
- THANK YOU.

08:51.732 --> 08:52.933
- OLIVIA.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.936
YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

08:55.969 --> 08:58.271
- UM...YEAH.
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

09:02.075 --> 09:03.977
- MAYBE IT'S A GOOD TIME
TO GET AWAY.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.245
- HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

09:05.278 --> 09:07.748
- THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HERE.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.249
NO HOT WATER...

09:09.282 --> 09:11.752
- WHAT?

09:11.785 --> 09:14.822
OH.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.691
I'M FINE, FIN.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.059
CHECK ON FLIGHTS?
YEAH.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.130
- CHILD SERVICES
WANTS A HEARING?

09:23.163 --> 09:24.131
WHY?

09:24.164 --> 09:25.966
- NOAH'S HEALTH QUESTIONS.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.368
- HE HAS LUNG ISSUES.
I JUST HAVE TO WATCH HIS ASTHMA.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.771
- THEY SAID THEY--
THEY FOUND SOME RIB FRACTURES.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.105
- THEY DIDN'T FIND THEM.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.206
MY DOCTOR FOUND THEM.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.809
STEMMING FROM INFANCY--
[knocking]

09:35.843 --> 09:37.077
- HEY, SERGEANT.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.378
- NOT NOW.
I JUST NEED A MINUTE.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.113
- I'M SORRY,
BUT VICAP IS A RABBIT HOLE.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.015
OKAY IF I PUT IN FOR OT?
- YES.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.086
THEY SHIPPED HIM AROUND
FROM FOSTER HOME

09:46.119 --> 09:49.022
TO FOSTER HOME FOR MONTHS,

09:49.056 --> 09:50.958
AND NOW THEY WANT
TO HOLD A HEARING?

09:50.991 --> 09:53.060
- OLIVIA, YOU CAN'T
TAKE THAT PERSONALLY.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.028
EVEN THOUGH YOU REPORTED
THE ABUSE,

09:55.062 --> 09:56.930
THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW UP.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.799
I'M STILL NOAH'S
LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE.

09:58.832 --> 10:02.169
FOR HIS SAKE, I JUST WANT YOU
PREPARED FOR THAT HEARING.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.042
- YOU GOT THREE MATCHING M.O.s

10:09.076 --> 10:10.644
AND YOU DIDN'T TEST
ANY OF THE KITS.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.680
- FIN--
- WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.682
$1,200 A TEST.

10:14.715 --> 10:18.018
WE JUST CAN'T AFFORD THAT
FOR EVERY SINGLE RAPE CLAIM.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.252
- CLAIM?

10:19.286 --> 10:21.789
- THESE GIRLS
WEREN'T EXACTLY VIRGINS.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.224
A PROSTITUTE, A JUNKIE,
AND A TEENAGE MOTHER,

10:24.257 --> 10:26.093
ALL OUT IN
THE EARLY MORNING HOURS,

10:26.126 --> 10:27.661
EACH INSISTING
THEY WERE ATTACKED

10:27.695 --> 10:29.997
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET
BY A COMPLETE STRANGER.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.800
- SO THEY EITHER ALL CAME UP
WITH THE SAME EXACT LIE

10:32.833 --> 10:35.068
OR YOU HAD A CONSISTENT M.O.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.004
SAY, IF YOU HAD THE KITS TESTED,

10:37.037 --> 10:39.673
I MEAN,
SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE POPPED.

10:39.707 --> 10:42.109
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING, AMANDA?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.144
SINCE YOU MOVED TO NEW YORK,

10:44.177 --> 10:47.147
YOUR HINDSIGHT'S GONE
ALL THE WAY UP TO 20/20.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.215
- [chuckles]

10:50.450 --> 10:53.086
- EVERYTHING HAS A NUMBER,

10:53.120 --> 10:56.323
BUT NOTHING IS EVER
WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.294
HAVE FUN, YOU TWO.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.063
ENJOY YOUR STAY.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.035
- I SEE WHY YOU LEFT.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.470
- YEAH.
UH...

11:10.503 --> 11:12.039
I DON'T--YOU WANT TO PICK
THAT SIDE?

11:12.072 --> 11:13.774
I'LL GET THIS ONE.

11:30.791 --> 11:31.058
.

11:31.091 --> 11:31.391
- [exhales]

11:36.830 --> 11:39.266
- THEY'RE NOT THERE, AMANDA.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.001
I GOT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
RIGHT HERE.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.038
- CHIEF PATTON.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.740
THOSE ARE MY RAPE KITS?

11:46.774 --> 11:48.441
- WELL, TECHNICALLY,
THEY'RE MINE,

11:48.475 --> 11:50.443
BUT I HEARD YOU NEEDED A FAVOR.

11:50.477 --> 11:53.446
- SO, NATURALLY,
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT I WAS COMING,

11:53.480 --> 11:55.415
YOU PULLED THEM
BEFORE I GOT HERE.

11:55.448 --> 11:59.086
- WELL, I FIGURED YOU'D HAVE
ASKED FOR ME WHEN YOU ARRIVED.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.487
THEY'VE BEEN IN MY OFFICE
SINCE YESTERDAY

12:00.520 --> 12:02.222
JUST WAITING FOR YOU.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.757
- MM.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.126
- I'M TRYING TO BE HELPFUL HERE,
DARLING.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.962
- AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.331
YOU KNOW, WHAT'D ACTUALLY BE
REALLY HELPFUL

12:11.364 --> 12:15.268
IS IF YOU TESTED
ALL OF THESE RAPE KITS.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.270
- [chuckles]

12:17.304 --> 12:19.006
YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS COULD
START AN ARGUMENT

12:19.039 --> 12:20.307
IN AN EMPTY HOUSE.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.046
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.414
- UH, YEAH.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.783
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
DETECTIVE TUTUOLA.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.218
THIS IS CHIEF PATTON.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.453
- HOW YOU DOING, CHIEF?
- NICE TO MEET YOU, DETECTIVE.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.955
- TURNS OUT THE DEPUTY CHIEF

12:34.988 --> 12:38.358
HAD SET THE KITS ASIDE FOR US
ALL ALONG.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.393
- A COMMUNICATIONS BREAKDOWN.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.895
- YEAH.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.130
- YEAH, WELL, I'LL TURN OVER
THESE RAPE KITS

12:43.163 --> 12:44.965
FOR TESTING RIGHT QUICK.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.499
WE'LL PUT A RUSH ON IT.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.001
- AND THE CASE FILES?

12:48.035 --> 12:50.503
- FILES?
WELL, TRY INITIAL REPORTS.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.439
SEE, NONE OF THESE WAS PURSUABLE
AT THE TIME,

12:52.472 --> 12:54.241
BUT FEEL FREE TO REOPEN.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.943
- REALLY?

12:55.976 --> 12:58.445
- WELL, IF I CAN CLEAR
THREE RAPES ON NYPD'S DIME,

12:58.478 --> 13:01.581
WELL, THAT WORKS OUT
FOR ALL OF US, DOESN'T IT?

13:01.614 --> 13:04.284
[chuckles]
NICE TO SEE YOU, AMANDA.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.919
- MMM.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.154
- ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.522
DETECTIVE TUTUOLA.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.597
- YOU MADE A LOT OF FRIENDS
DOWN HERE, HUH?

13:17.630 --> 13:20.968
- THEY'RE JUST TRYING
TO MAKE SURE I KNOW MY PLACE.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.943
THE FIRST ONE DIED LAST YEAR,
THE SECOND ONE MOVED TO ALASKA,

13:29.977 --> 13:32.279
AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK
TO THE THIRD.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.047
I GOT IT, SERGEANT.

13:34.081 --> 13:37.250
HEY, SO LIV SAYS CARISI
HAS THREE MORE RAPES IN VEGAS

13:37.284 --> 13:38.485
THAT COULD ALSO BE OUR GUY.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.587
- WHEN?
- 2010.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.256
IT'S THE SAME--
THE HUMMING, THE GLOVES,

13:43.290 --> 13:45.058
EARLY MORNING, CHOKED OUT.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.360
- OKAY, SO HE RAPES THREE
IN ATLANTA, THREE IN VEGAS,

13:47.394 --> 13:48.929
THEN HE GOES
OFF THE GRID FOR FOUR YEARS?

13:48.962 --> 13:50.563
- MAYBE HE GOT PICKED UP.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.033
I MEAN, CARISI'S CHECKING
PRISON RECORDS NOW.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.367
ASHLEY MILLER?
- YES?

13:54.401 --> 13:55.602
CAN I HELP YOU?

13:55.635 --> 13:58.238
- NYPD.
CAN WE ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS?

13:58.271 --> 13:59.639
- ABOUT WHAT?
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO NEW YORK.

13:59.672 --> 14:03.110
- THIS IS ABOUT A CRIME
YOU REPORTED BACK IN 2008.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.346
CAN WE COME IN?

14:06.379 --> 14:07.514
- WHO IS IT, SWEETHEART?

14:07.547 --> 14:09.382
- JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.518
- WE DON'T WANT ANY.
- WE'RE JUST TALKING.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.020
- YOUR HUSBAND DOESN'T KNOW?

14:13.053 --> 14:15.022
- NO, AND I DON'T WANT HIM TO.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.556
DID YOU CATCH THE GUY?

14:16.589 --> 14:18.491
- WE'RE TRYING.
- THEN WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

14:18.525 --> 14:21.394
I TOLD ATLANTA PD EVERYTHING
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.096
THEY SAID I WAS MAKING IT UP.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.098
- YEAH, UM...

14:25.132 --> 14:27.034
WE BELIEVE YOU, OKAY,

14:27.067 --> 14:28.435
AND WE THINK THAT THIS GUY

14:28.468 --> 14:30.437
HAS ATTACKED
SOME MORE WOMEN IN NEW YORK.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.240
- IN NEW YORK?
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

14:33.273 --> 14:35.275
- HE HAS A PATTERN
THAT MATCHES THE DETAILS

14:35.308 --> 14:37.077
YOU GAVE DOWN HERE IN ATLANTA.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.546
HE USES GLOVES,
HE CHOKES HIS VICTIMS,

14:39.579 --> 14:40.948
HE EVEN HUMS.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.415
- OH, GOD.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.251
I'LL NEVER GET THAT HYMN
OUT OF MY HEAD.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.585
- DO YOU KNOW THE SONG?

14:45.618 --> 14:49.489
- YES, HE HUMMED AT FIRST.
THEN HE STARTED SINGING.

14:53.526 --> 14:58.131
[shakily]
* LEANING, LEANING

14:58.165 --> 15:02.035
* SAFE AND SECURE
FROM ALL ALARMS *

15:03.636 --> 15:05.438
I CAN'T EVEN GO
TO CHURCH ANYMORE.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.008
I-I TOLD THE POLICE
ALL OF THAT.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.945
- WELL, THEY DIDN'T DO RIGHT
BY YOU.

15:11.979 --> 15:16.583
AND WE'RE SORRY ABOUT THAT,
BUT WE'RE GONNA FIX IT, OKAY?

15:16.616 --> 15:18.451
SO WOULD YOU MIND
TAKING A LOOK AT THIS?

15:18.485 --> 15:21.321
THIS IS YOUR ORIGINAL STATEMENT
TO ATLANTA PD.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.356
JUST GO OVER IT
AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY DETAILS

15:23.390 --> 15:26.359
THAT MAYBE CHANGED OR--
OR WERE LEFT OUT.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.999
- IT'S ALL HERE.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.600
WAIT.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.503
BEFORE HE LEFT,
HIS PAGER WENT OFF.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.271
HE TOLD ME
OTHER PEOPLE NEEDED HIM,

15:38.305 --> 15:39.472
BUT HE'D BE BACK.

15:39.506 --> 15:40.974
- PAGER?
- YES.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.342
WHEN I TOLD THE DETECTIVE THAT,

15:42.375 --> 15:45.178
HE ASKED IF I DATED
ANY DRUG DEALERS.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.713
- HMPH.
- I HAVE TO GO.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.515
MY HUSBAND KNOWS THE BELL
RINGERS DON'T TAKE LONG.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.251
- AND IF YOU WANT TO HEAR
MORE ABOUT THE GOOD NEWS,

15:51.284 --> 15:53.186
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND US.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.687
OKAY?

15:58.258 --> 15:59.726
- THIS GUY'S GOT A PAGER--
[phone chiming]

15:59.759 --> 16:01.594
KNOWS HOW TO MAKE HIS VICS
PASS OUT--

16:01.628 --> 16:03.230
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
A DOCTOR?

16:03.263 --> 16:06.366
- HUH. ROLLINS.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.635
IT IS?

16:08.668 --> 16:10.637
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER, HUH?

16:10.670 --> 16:12.972
OKAY, SO I GUESS YOU GUYS
ARE RUNNING IT THROUGH CODIS?

16:14.041 --> 16:16.176
GREAT, THANKS.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.477
DNA CAME BACK FROM ATLANTA.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.711
THE SON OF A BITCH
MUST HAVE PUT IT IN

16:18.745 --> 16:20.180
BEFORE WE EVEN GOT HERE.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.581
- ALL THREE THE SAME GUY?

16:21.614 --> 16:23.716
- YEAH.
[car chirping]

16:23.750 --> 16:25.518
WE'RE CALLING IT
PATTERN 17.

16:25.552 --> 16:29.056
NOW, THE DNA PROVES THAT ONE
PERP MATCHING OUR NEW YORK M.O.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.557
COMMITTED THREE RAPES
IN FIVE WEEKS

16:30.590 --> 16:32.325
DOWN IN ATLANTA IN 2008.

16:32.359 --> 16:35.328
- THE BRAINIACS HAD THE PATTERN
AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.164
THEY DIDN'T EVEN LOOK
FOR SIX YEARS.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.531
- ANY MATCHES IN CODIS?

16:38.565 --> 16:39.732
- NOTHING.
NOT EVEN FAMILIAL.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.201
DNA DOES SHOW
THAT HE'S A WHITE MALE

16:41.234 --> 16:42.435
OF EUROPEAN DESCENT.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.071
- WHICH IS FAIRLY USELESS.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.638
YOU'RE CHECKING MATCHING M.O.s
IN OTHER STATES?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.807
- YEAH, HEY MAY HAVE STRUCK
IN VEGAS, POSSIBLY MILWAUKEE.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.609
- YOU GET DNA FROM THOSE CASES?

16:49.642 --> 16:51.578
- MILWAUKEE HAS A BACKLOG
ABOUT A MILE LONG,

16:51.611 --> 16:53.313
AND LAS VEGAS DOESN'T KNOW

16:53.346 --> 16:54.781
IF THEY'VE EVEN
TESTED THE KITS OR NOT.

16:54.814 --> 16:57.784
- WHAT WORRIES US IS,
THIS GUY GOES ON SPREES.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.819
- AND HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE
RIGHT NOW.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.654
- YOU TALK TO THE VICS
IN ATLANTA?

17:01.688 --> 17:04.757
- JUST ONE, AND SHE SAID THAT
HE LIKES TO SING CHURCH SONGS

17:04.791 --> 17:06.559
AND THAT HE MAY HAVE
USED A PAGER.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.596
- SOUNDS LIKE
A COST-EFFECTIVE TRIP.

17:09.629 --> 17:12.232
- LOOK, WE'VE GOT THIS, CHIEF.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.067
IT'S JUST LEGWORK.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.403
- TRY TO PUT SOME SHINE ON IT
BEFORE TOMORROW.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.737
- WHAT'S TOMORROW?

17:17.770 --> 17:22.275
- THE COMPSTAT BRIEFING
ON THE PATTERN 17 RAPIST.

17:22.309 --> 17:25.312
YOU'RE IN THE HOT SEAT,
SERGEANT.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.746
- SEE, THAT...

17:26.779 --> 17:29.682
THAT'S WHY I NEVER TOOK
THE SERGEANT'S EXAM.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.487
- GOOD MORNING, SERGEANT.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.656
ANY THOUGHTS ON THIS HEADLINE?

17:36.689 --> 17:39.192
- I CAN'T CONTROL THE PRESS,
DEPUTY COMMISSIONER,

17:39.226 --> 17:41.794
BUT WHAT I CAN DO IS
REASSURE YOU

17:41.828 --> 17:44.697
THAT WE HAVE A DETAILED M.O.
OF THE SUSPECT.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.367
WE HAVE RE-CANVASSED
THE CRIME SCENES,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.502
CHECKED SECURITY FOOTAGE,
TRAFFIC CAMERAS--

17:49.536 --> 17:51.604
- ANYTHING TO SHOW FOR THAT?

17:51.638 --> 17:53.206
- IT'S A PROCESS, SIR.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.641
- SO, NO.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.543
CAN I AT LEAST ASSUME

17:56.576 --> 17:58.545
THAT YOU CHECKED
THE ALPR DATABASES?

17:58.578 --> 18:01.481
- NO LICENSE PLATES
FROM EITHER CRIME SCENE

18:01.514 --> 18:02.849
MATCHED ANY KNOWN OFFENDERS,

18:02.882 --> 18:04.851
AND AT NO TIME
DID THE SAME CAR APPEAR.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.619
- WELL, THEN THE HEADLINE
IS RIGHT.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.556
THERE ARE NO LEADS,
AND WITHOUT ATLANTA PD'S HELP,

18:09.589 --> 18:10.823
YOU'D HAVE NEVER KNOWN
YOU HAD A PATTERN.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.492
- THAT'S THEIR SPIN.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.694
THE TRUTH IS THAT
WE HAD TO ASK THEM

18:14.727 --> 18:17.864
TO TEST RAPE KITS
FROM THREE OF THEIR COLD CASES.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.532
- EITHER WAY,
THE SUSPECT HAS BEEN ACTIVE

18:19.566 --> 18:21.534
FOR SEVERAL YEARS
IN TWO CITIES.

18:21.568 --> 18:22.569
- WE BELIEVE THAT THE SUSPECT
HAS BEEN ACTIVE

18:22.602 --> 18:24.404
IN MORE CITIES THAN THAT.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.573
AND, AGAIN, GIVEN THE BACKLOG
OF UNTESTED RAPE KITS--

18:26.606 --> 18:29.309
- HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
THE GAPS IN HIS TIMELINE?

18:31.244 --> 18:33.313
- IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT HE WAS INCARCERATED.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.548
- WELL, THEN WOULDN'T HE BE
IN CODIS, SERGEANT?

18:35.582 --> 18:37.184
- NOT NECESSARILY.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.219
UNFORTUNATELY,
MOST STATES DON'T HAVE

18:39.252 --> 18:41.321
ALL CRIMES DNA COLLECTION.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.691
GIVEN THAT AND THE BACKLOG
OF UNPROCESSED RAPE KITS--

18:44.724 --> 18:47.427
- SO OTHER STATES,
OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.262
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S
EVERYONE'S FAULT BUT YOURS.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.664
- NO, THAT IS NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.800
HE IS OUR PROBLEM NOW
AND WE WILL GET HIM.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.635
- I'M SORRY, SERGEANT BENSON.
WE'LL NEED TO CUT THIS SHORT.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.270
- HOLD UP.
HOLD UP.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.506
SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO TELL THE PRESS?

18:59.539 --> 19:01.174
- I DON'T CARE, BUT HERE'S
ONE THING YOU DON'T TELL THEM:

19:01.208 --> 19:03.243
WE'RE ESTABLISHING
A NEW CRIME SCENE.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.158
.

19:19.192 --> 19:19.592
- HOW BAD?
- BAD.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.229
- SHE'S 12.
- OH, GOD.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.696
SEEMS A LITTLE YOUNG
FOR OUR GUY.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.365
ARE WE SURE THAT IT'S HIM?
- YEAH, LOOKS LIKE IT.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.534
RYANN CATALANO WAS OUT
WALKING HER PUPPY AT 6:00 A.M.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.369
WHEN A MAN
WEARING GLOVES AND HUMMING

19:29.402 --> 19:31.304
SHOVED HER INTO A CAR
AND TRIED TO CHOKE HER.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.673
- BUT HE DIDN'T FINISH THE RAPE.
- WHAT?

19:33.706 --> 19:36.676
- HER DOG DID WHAT DOGS DO:
SPOOKED HIM.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.845
- WHERE'S THE GIRL NOW?
- SHE'S UPSTAIRS.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.315
[elevator dings]

19:42.349 --> 19:44.217
- HEY.
CAN I TALK TO HER?

19:44.251 --> 19:45.685
- I JUST HEARD FROM THE NURSE.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.520
RYANN IS DONE WITH HER EXAM.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.522
HER MOTHER'S IN THERE
WITH HER NOW.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.525
THE FATHER...
THIS IS HIM.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.494
- ARE YOU THE SERGEANT
EVERYONE'S BEEN WAITING FOR?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.496
- UH, YES.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.431
MR. CATALANO,
I'D LIKE TO GET

19:58.465 --> 19:59.899
YOUR DAUGHTER'S STATEMENT
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

19:59.932 --> 20:01.734
SO WE CAN CATCH
WHOEVER DID THIS.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.770
IN THE MEANTIME, MY DETECTIVES
ARE GONNA TAKE YOUR STATEMENT,

20:03.803 --> 20:05.405
IF THAT'S OKAY.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.939
- LET'S TALK OVER HERE
WHERE IT'S MORE QUIET.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.512
- I TOLD HER TO WAIT FOR ME,
BUT SHE SLEEPS WITH THAT PUPPY,

20:12.545 --> 20:14.414
KEEPS TAKING HIM OUT
ON HER OWN.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.649
- SO YOUR DAUGHTER WAS OUT
WALKING THE DOG BY HERSELF?

20:16.683 --> 20:18.351
- I WAS GETTING READY FOR WORK
AND I HEARD MAX,

20:18.385 --> 20:20.019
THE DOG, BARKING,

20:20.052 --> 20:22.422
SO I RAN OUT.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.258
MAX MUST'VE BIT THE BASTARD
PRETTY GOOD, 'CAUSE--

20:25.292 --> 20:27.427
THAT'S WHY HE PUSHED RYANN OUT
OF THE CAR BEFORE HE TOOK OFF.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.563
- HOLD ON.
SO THE DOG BIT THE ASSAILANT?

20:30.597 --> 20:32.399
- IT WAS MAX.
HE SAVED ME.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.334
- YOU'RE LUCKY HE WAS WITH YOU.

20:34.367 --> 20:37.370
- OKAY, AND YOU SAID YOUR
ATTACKER WAS WEARING GLOVES

20:37.404 --> 20:38.805
AND--AND HE WAS HUMMING.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.973
- YES.
I DIDN'T KNOW THE SONG.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.609
- THAT'S OKAY.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.577
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN TELL US?

20:44.611 --> 20:47.046
- DID YOU GET A LOOK
AT HIS FACE, RYANN?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.715
- NOT REALLY.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.550
HE GRABBED ME FROM BEHIND.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.353
BUT I DIDN'T LET GO
OF MAX'S LEASH,

20:53.386 --> 20:55.054
NOT EVEN WHEN HE PULLED ME
INTO HIS CAR.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.324
- AND THAT CAR.
WHAT KIND WAS IT?

20:57.357 --> 20:59.292
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW
ABOUT CARS.

20:59.326 --> 21:00.927
- WELL, YOU REMEMBER
HOW MANY DOORS IT HAD

21:00.960 --> 21:03.930
OR--OR WHAT COLOR IT WAS, MAYBE?

21:03.963 --> 21:07.300
- FOUR.
IT WAS BLACK LIKE THE SEATS.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.835
- OKAY.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.304
- I REMEMBER BECAUSE I SHOVED
MY HEADPHONES BETWEEN THEM

21:11.338 --> 21:13.973
SO I COULD PROVE I WAS THERE.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.309
- THAT WAS A VERY SMART THING
TO DO.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.877
- I TIRED TO MEMORIZE
THE LICENSE PLATE,

21:17.910 --> 21:20.413
BUT I DIDN'T GET IT ALL.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.081
IT WAS BLUE AND WHITE, THOUGH.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.550
- GREAT.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.318
- I'M SORRY.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.720
- DON'T SAY SORRY, HONEY.
YOU DID GREAT.

21:27.754 --> 21:30.089
NOW, IS THERE ANY PART
OF THAT LICENSE PLATE

21:30.122 --> 21:32.625
THAT YOU DO REMEMBER?

21:34.827 --> 21:36.028
ANY LUCK?

21:36.062 --> 21:37.664
- SO FAR, I GOT 40 BLACK SEDANS

21:37.697 --> 21:40.567
WITH CONNECTICUT PLATES
MATCHING THE PARTIALS GQJ6.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.403
- OKAY, SO CHECK E-ZPASS
RECORDS, LICENSE PLATE READERS,

21:43.436 --> 21:44.904
SEE IF YOU CAN PUT
ANY OF THOSE SEDANS

21:44.937 --> 21:46.339
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.375
- CSU HAS GOT THE DOG NOW.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.409
THEY'RE SWABBING HIS TEETH
FOR DNA.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.710
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:50.743 --> 21:52.445
TELL THEM TO SCRAPE
THE NAILS TOO.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.713
- GOT IT.
- HEY, SARGE.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.616
I GOT A 2014 LINCOLN MKZ,

21:56.649 --> 21:58.117
BLACK, CONNECTICUT PLATES,

21:58.150 --> 21:59.786
REGISTERED TO
A DR. JOSEPH CONKLIN.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.388
HE WORKS OUT AT MERCY HOSPITAL.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.622
- NOWHERE NEAR ANY OF
THE THREE RAPES--

22:02.655 --> 22:04.391
- BUT HE'S A DOCTOR.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.693
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE PAGER,
THE GLOVES, THE CHOKE HOLD.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.662
- OKAY, ANYTHING CONNECT HIM
TO ATLANTA OR VEGAS?

22:09.696 --> 22:11.030
- I DID AN NCIC OFFLINE SEARCH,

22:11.063 --> 22:12.098
LOOKING FOR A TRAFFIC STOP
OR ANYTHING.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.633
NOTHING CAME UP.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.867
I'M STILL CHECKING HIS PEDIGREE,
THOUGH.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.469
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT, HOLD UP.

22:16.503 --> 22:19.972
- HOLD UP--THE DEA
HAS AN OPEN FILE ON THIS GUY.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.675
- THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING AT HIM
FOR PUSHING PILLS FOR MONTHS.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.711
- THAT COULD BE
ENOUGH FOR A WARRANT.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.012
- GOOD.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.817
[car chirping]

22:30.850 --> 22:33.853
[police radio murmuring]

22:35.522 --> 22:37.123
- YOU GUYS GET THE COLLAR
ON THOSE.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.858
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
IN THE BACKSEAT.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.095
- HEY!

22:43.129 --> 22:44.564
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?

22:44.597 --> 22:46.399
- NYPD.
HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

22:46.433 --> 22:47.867
- I WAS JUST SHOWING HIM
MY ID BADGE.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.402
I'M A DOCTOR.
I WORK HERE.

22:49.436 --> 22:50.937
- YEAH?

22:50.970 --> 22:52.572
WHAT'S ALL THAT STUFF
IN YOUR TRUNK, SAMPLES?

22:52.605 --> 22:54.407
THAT'S A YEAR'S SUPPLY
OF OXYCODONE.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.042
- I HAVE AN OFFICE
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.410
- YEAH, YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN
WHAT THESE WERE DOING

22:57.444 --> 22:59.045
IN THE BACKSEAT OF YOUR CAR?

22:59.078 --> 23:00.880
SITTING THERE IN PLAIN SIGHT,
JUST LIKE SHE SAID.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.715
- I DON'T KNOW WHOSE THOSE ARE,
BUT HEADPHONES ARE NOT ILLEGAL.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.451
- JOSEPH CONKLIN,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

23:04.484 --> 23:06.118
FOR ATTEMPTED RAPE,
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.186
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT--

23:07.219 --> 23:08.655
- RAPE?

23:08.688 --> 23:10.490
THOSE WOMEN AGREED TO DO
WHAT THEY DID.

23:10.523 --> 23:11.824
THEY JUST WANTED THE PILLS.

23:11.858 --> 23:14.060
- YEAH?
KEEP TALKING.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.062
COME ON.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.129
- HER HEADPHONES WERE
IN THE BACKSEAT?

23:17.163 --> 23:19.732
- THEY WERE.
- SO WE GOT OUR GUY.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.033
- WE'RE HOLDING HIM
ON A DRUG CHARGE

23:21.067 --> 23:22.569
UNTIL THE DNA COMES BACK.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.170
- WE'RE DOING THE LINEUP NOW?
- RIGHT NOW.

23:24.203 --> 23:25.672
- NICE WORK.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.044
- HI.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.681
- CAN YOU SEE THE MAN
WHO ATTACKED YOU, ANNIE?

23:37.016 --> 23:38.551
TAKE YOUR TIME.

23:42.154 --> 23:44.491
- I THINK--

23:44.524 --> 23:46.493
- IT'S OKAY.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.861
- I DON'T THINK IT'S
ANY OF THEM.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.568
- I'M SORRY.
I DON'T SEE HIM.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.108
- MAYBE NUMBER FOUR?

24:02.141 --> 24:05.011
I'M NOT SURE.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.614
I'M SORRY.
IT'S NOT NUMBER FOUR.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.248
- OKAY.
- I...

24:09.281 --> 24:11.117
I REALLY DIDN'T GET
A GOOD LOOK.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.019
I CAN'T PICK HIM OUT.
I'M SORRY.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.186
- THAT'S OKAY.
THAT'S OKAY.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.755
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.192
[rapping on glass]

24:20.226 --> 24:22.495
LOOK, WE ALL KNOW THAT
EYEWITNESS RECOLLECTIONS

24:22.529 --> 24:23.563
ARE UNRELIABLE, SO--

24:23.596 --> 24:25.632
- 0 FOR THREE.
WHAT ABOUT ATLANTA?

24:25.665 --> 24:27.500
- WE COULD TRY,
BUT IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS.

24:27.534 --> 24:28.868
- I CAN EMAIL
A PHOTO ARRAY DOWN.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.703
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WE GOT HIM.

24:30.737 --> 24:33.239
RYANN'S HEADPHONES WERE
INSIDE OF HIS CAR.

24:33.272 --> 24:35.207
CSU FOUND HER PRINTS
IN THE BACKSEAT.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.076
- HOW LONG ON HIS DNA?

24:37.109 --> 24:40.079
- WE JUST GOT HIS SAMPLE.
IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.881
- WELL, THEN DON'T WAIT.
LIE.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.215
TELL HIM WE HAVE A MATCH.

24:43.249 --> 24:44.751
WE ALREADY KNOW IT'S HIM.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.687
- MY DNA?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.155
THAT HAS TO BE A MISTAKE.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.590
I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN
TO ATLANTA.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.792
OR MILWAUKEE.
THIS IS CRAZY.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.226
- AND YOU CAN PROVE THAT?

24:54.260 --> 24:56.896
- HOW DO I PROVE I WAS
NEVER IN A CITY I WAS NEVER IN?

24:56.929 --> 24:58.531
AND I DON'T KNOW
ANY OF THESE GIRLS.

24:58.565 --> 24:59.866
NEVER SEEN THEM.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.534
- NOT EVEN HER?

25:01.568 --> 25:03.202
HOW'D HER HEADPHONES GET
IN THE BACKSEAT OF YOUR CAR?

25:03.235 --> 25:06.272
- I DIDN'T RAPE ANYBODY,
ESPECIALLY NOT SOME LITTLE GIRL.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.207
- THEN WHY'D YOU CLAIM
IT WAS CONSENSUAL RIGHT AWAY?

25:08.240 --> 25:10.877
YOU SAID THAT THEY AGREED.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.211
- THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE.

25:12.244 --> 25:13.646
- WHAT?

25:20.753 --> 25:22.188
- IF HE EXPLAINS WHAT IT WAS,

25:22.221 --> 25:25.758
AND IT'S A CRIME THAT HAS
NO BEARING ON THIS ONE,

25:25.792 --> 25:27.226
WE NEED IMMUNITY.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.895
- WE'LL TALK TO THE D.A.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.930
- LOOK, I HAVE WOMEN LINING UP
TO HAVE SEX

25:30.963 --> 25:32.965
FOR A HANDFUL OF OXYCODONE.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.634
FIVE PILLS A BLOW.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.002
A DOZEN FOR FULL SERVICE.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.937
- SO YOU'RE ADMITTING
TO SOLICITATION

25:37.970 --> 25:39.639
AND PILL-PUSHING,
BUT NOT RAPE.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.641
- WHAT DID I JUST SAY?
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.643
THE WOMEN ARE IN PAIN.
THE PRESCRIPTIONS ARE LEGAL.

25:43.676 --> 25:47.113
- NOT IF THEY HAVE TO PERFORM
A SEX ACT TO GET THEM.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.181
- ALL RIGHT, JOSEPH,
YOU'VE SAID ENOUGH.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.018
- FAMILY COURT?
TOMORROW?

25:52.051 --> 25:53.285
I UNDERSTAND THAT, COUNSELOR,

25:53.319 --> 25:55.988
BUT IS THERE ANY WAY
THAT WE CAN POSTPONE--

25:56.022 --> 25:57.556
- SARGE--GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS.
- ONE SECOND.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.293
I UNDERSTAND THAT'S NOT
WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.195
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.798
I WILL BE THERE.

26:05.832 --> 26:08.701
YEAH.
THANK YOU.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.637
- BAD TIME?

26:10.670 --> 26:12.104
- ALWAYS.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.006
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

26:14.040 --> 26:16.308
- IT'S NOT HIM.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.344
- THE DNA CAME BACK THAT FAST?
- NO.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.046
BEFORE RUNNING THE DNA,

26:20.079 --> 26:22.281
I HAD THE M.E. CHECK
BLOOD TYPES, OLD SCHOOL.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.283
BUT MERCY HOSPITAL
HAS DR. CONKLIN'S

26:24.316 --> 26:25.885
ON FILE AS O POSITIVE.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.955
ALL THE DNA FROM ATLANTA
IS FROM SOMEBODY AB.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.289
- [raps glass]
IT'S STILL HIS CAR.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.024
- YEAH.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.930
- HEY, SARGE.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.166
OUR RAPIST IS METHODICAL.
HE'S METICULOUS.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.702
THIS GUY'S A MESS.
- I KNOW. IT'S NOT HIM.

26:42.735 --> 26:44.236
BUT IT'S STILL HIS CAR.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.372
- NOT TO MENTION HE'S
A PILL-PUSHING LOWLIFE.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.240
- YEAH, WHICH MEANS
HE PROBABLY LOANED HIS CAR

26:48.274 --> 26:50.209
TO ANOTHER LOWLIFE
AND NOW HE'S COVERING FOR HIM.

26:50.242 --> 26:53.012
- SO GO BACK IN THERE
AND YOU SWEAT HIM.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.147
YOU FIND OUT WHO HAD ACCESS.

26:55.181 --> 26:58.084
CHECK HOSPITAL GARAGE
SECURITY FOOTAGE.

27:07.326 --> 27:07.760
.

27:07.794 --> 27:08.761
- I TOLD YOU, NO ONE
WHO WORKS HERE TOOK HIS CAR.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.998
- YEAH, AND WE BELIEVE YOU.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.432
DR. CONKLIN SWEARS
THAT NOBODY ELSE HAD ACCESS.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.067
SO--SO WHY DON'T YOU
WALK US THROUGH THIS?

27:15.101 --> 27:17.036
THE DOCTOR PARKED HIS CAR
HERE EVERY DAY.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.338
- YEAH, HE TIPS EXTRA,
SO HIS CAR'S RIGHT UP FRONT.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.173
- IS THIS LOT OPEN
TO THE PUBLIC?

27:21.207 --> 27:24.977
- NO, JUST DOCTORS, VENDORS,
AND ADMINISTRATORS.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.213
- WHAT ABOUT NURSES?

27:27.246 --> 27:29.682
ANYBODY ELSE
WHO TREATS PATIENTS?

27:29.716 --> 27:33.152
- THE EMTs PARK
THEIR AMBULANCES, SOMETIMES.

27:33.185 --> 27:36.122
- EMTs?
SO YOU KEEP AMBULANCE KEYS HERE?

27:36.155 --> 27:38.725
- YEAH, IN CASE THEY'RE BLOCKING
A DOCTOR'S CAR.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.226
THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.994
IF THEY GET A CALL,
THEY JUST GRAB THEM.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.896
- SO THE EMTs HAVE ACCESS
TO THE KEYS

27:43.930 --> 27:45.364
EVEN WHEN NOBODY'S IN THE BOOTH?

27:45.397 --> 27:47.066
- THEY'RE THE GOOD GUYS.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.167
THEY WOULDN'T TAKE ANYTHING.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.870
- YEAH, BUT YOU LOG THEM IN,
RIGHT?

27:50.903 --> 27:53.005
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SEE
THAT LOG BOOK.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.978
- MS. JACKSON,
AFTER YOU DISCOVERED

27:59.011 --> 28:01.180
THAT NOAH PORTER
WAS IN INTENSIVE CARE

28:01.213 --> 28:04.050
AND THAT MS. BENSON
WAS NOT PRESENT,

28:04.083 --> 28:05.351
DID YOU ATTEMPT
TO CONTACT HER?

28:05.384 --> 28:07.153
- SEVERAL TIMES.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.255
WHEN SHE FINALLY CALLED ME BACK,
SHE CLAIMED A WORK EMERGENCY.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.023
- CLAIMED?
- LIV.

28:11.057 --> 28:13.125
- WHY DID MS. BENSON'S ABSENCE
TROUBLE YOU?

28:13.159 --> 28:15.061
- NOAH PORTER WAS IN CRISIS.

28:15.094 --> 28:17.396
AS THE GUARDIAN OF
A HIGH-RISK FOSTER CHILD,

28:17.429 --> 28:20.232
MS. BENSON HAS TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.034
- THANK YOU.

28:22.068 --> 28:24.070
- YOUR HONOR,
AS NOAH'S LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE,

28:24.103 --> 28:25.371
I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.073
- OF COURSE, MR. LANGAN.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.809
- FIRST, MS. JACKSON,
I APPRECIATE YOUR DILIGENCE

28:29.842 --> 28:32.078
IN LOOKING OUT FOR NOAH.
- THANK YOU.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.780
- NOW, SINCE YOU'VE BEEN
MANAGING THIS CASE,

28:33.813 --> 28:35.147
I'M SURE YOU'VE MADE
SEVERAL HOME VISITS.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.950
HAVE YOU FOUND THE BABY
WELL PROVIDED AND CARED FOR?

28:37.984 --> 28:39.218
- I THOUGHT I HAD.

28:39.251 --> 28:42.021
- SIGNIFICANTLY
BETTER CARED FOR

28:42.054 --> 28:44.223
THAN IN THE FOUR EARLIER HOMES
HE'D BEEN IN

28:44.256 --> 28:46.125
UNDER YOUR AGENCY'S WATCH?

28:46.158 --> 28:49.028
- I TRY NOT TO LOOK BACKWARDS
IN MANAGING MY CASE FILES.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.229
- LET ME DO THAT FOR YOU.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.965
WHEN NOAH WAS HOSPITALIZED
RECENTLY,

28:52.999 --> 28:58.304
THE CHILD'S DOCTOR DISCOVERED
BROKEN RIBS SINCE HEALED

28:58.337 --> 29:01.040
AND OTHER SIGNS
OF EARLY INFANT ABUSE.

29:01.073 --> 29:04.076
- THAT ABUSE MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED
BEFORE HE WAS UNDER OUR WATCH.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.846
- EITHER WAY, YOUR AGENCY
DIDN'T NOTICE THE ABUSE,

29:06.879 --> 29:08.781
WHILE MS. BENSON'S DOCTOR DID.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.482
- MS. BENSON SHOULD HAVE
BEEN THERE.

29:10.516 --> 29:11.951
MY CONCERN IS,

29:11.984 --> 29:15.087
AS A SINGLE MOTHER
IN A HIGH-STRESS JOB,

29:15.121 --> 29:17.523
SHE CAN'T MAKE THIS CHILD
HER FIRST PRIORITY.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.029
- HEY, GUYS.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.130
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.464
- I TOLD HIM YOU WERE
ON YOUR WAY.

29:25.497 --> 29:27.967
- NO PROBLEM.
WE STARTED WITHOUT YOU.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.568
- WHAT DO WE HAVE
ON OUR SUSPECT?

29:29.601 --> 29:34.273
- HOSPITAL SECURITY FOOTAGE
CAUGHT ALBERT BECK, NO RECORD,

29:34.306 --> 29:37.243
EMT FOR RED ALERT AMBULETTE
FOR FOUR YEARS.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.545
HIS SUPERVISOR
CALLED HIM A HERO

29:39.578 --> 29:41.447
AND HE WAS DECORATED
FOR HEROIC ACTION

29:41.480 --> 29:43.983
AFTER THE METRO NORTH DERAILMENT
LAST YEAR.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.118
AND AFTER FINISHING
HIS GRAVEYARD SHIFT,

29:46.152 --> 29:48.154
HE RETURNED AN AMBULETTE
TO THE GARAGE

29:48.187 --> 29:50.489
AN HOUR BEFORE THE ASSAULT
ON RYANN CATALANO.

29:50.522 --> 29:53.025
- AND HE WAS CAUGHT ON VIDEO
DRIVING CONKLIN'S CAR.

29:53.059 --> 29:55.027
WHY ISN'T HE IN CUSTODY YET?
- IT'S HIS DAY OFF.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.262
FIN AND CARISI
ARE ON THEIR WAY

29:56.295 --> 29:57.997
TO HIS HOME ADDRESS IN QUEENS
RIGHT NOW.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.866
- OKAY, CAN WE PLACE HIM
IN ATLANTA OR MILWAUKEE?

29:59.899 --> 30:01.934
- YEAH, WE CAN.
- YES.

30:01.968 --> 30:05.071
- HE WAS AN EMT IN ATLANTA
FROM 2007 TO 2009

30:05.104 --> 30:06.973
AND THEN MILWAUKEE
THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.140
THIS AMBULETTE SERVICE
GIVES HIM

30:08.174 --> 30:09.608
A PERFECT COVER
TO TROLL FOR VICTIMS.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.277
- AND THEN HE MOVES TO NEW YORK,

30:11.310 --> 30:14.013
WHERE HE LIVES FOR FOUR YEARS
WITHOUT INCIDENT,

30:14.046 --> 30:15.414
AND THEN SUDDENLY STARTS
RAPING AGAIN.

30:15.447 --> 30:18.084
WHY NOW?
- ASK HIM WHEN YOU PICK HIM UP.

30:18.117 --> 30:19.919
AND YOU BETTER HOPE IT'S HIM.

30:19.952 --> 30:22.821
YOUR REPORT TO COMPSTAT
DIDN'T WIN YOU ANY FANS.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.995
- SCREW ALBERT.

30:29.028 --> 30:31.330
- SO YOU WON'T MIND TELLING US
WHERE HE IS?

30:31.363 --> 30:33.165
- IF I KNEW,
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.968
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE BASTARD SINCE
I THREW HIS ASS OUT A MONTH AGO.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.904
- WHAT MADE YOU DO THAT,
MS. BURNS?

30:37.937 --> 30:39.939
- HEH.

30:39.972 --> 30:42.008
- MOM, WHAT DID YOU DO?

30:42.041 --> 30:43.876
- NOTHING.
THE COPS CAME ON THEIR OWN.

30:43.910 --> 30:46.012
THEY'RE ASKING ABOUT ALBERT,
BIG SHOCKER.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.413
- HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.248
- NOBODY'S SAYING THAT HE DID.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.083
- IT'S YOUR FAULT HE LEFT.

30:51.117 --> 30:52.952
HE HATES YOU.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.420
AND I HATE YOU TOO.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.326
- YOU WANT TO TELL US
WHAT'S GOING ON, MA'AM?

31:00.359 --> 31:01.994
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

31:02.028 --> 31:03.129
LOOK AT HER.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.164
SHE'S YOUNGER AND DUMBER.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.234
SON OF A BITCH TRADED UP...

31:08.267 --> 31:10.002
OR DOWN.

31:10.036 --> 31:12.538
SHE'S 15.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.077
- THE PERP'S GIRLFRIEND
DOESN'T KNOW WHERE HE IS?

31:18.110 --> 31:19.511
- LAUREN BURNS IS THE EX.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.347
SHE BOOTED HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE
A MONTH AGO.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.549
- AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT
HE STARTS STALKING HIS NEW VICS.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.584
- I DID A NEXUS
AND REAL ESTATE SEARCH,

31:25.617 --> 31:27.019
AND SHE AND ALBERT BECK
LIVED TOGETHER

31:27.053 --> 31:28.387
IN MILWAUKEE BACK IN 2010.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.122
- THE SAME TIME
THE MILWAUKEE RAPES STOPPED.

31:30.156 --> 31:32.124
- AND THEN HER DAUGHTER, BETH,
NOW 15,

31:32.158 --> 31:34.293
MOVED WITH HIM TO NEW YORK
A YEAR LATER.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.963
- OKAY, WELL, SHE'S PETITE.
THAT'S HIS TYPE.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.464
EXPLAINS THE FOUR-YEAR GAP
IN RAPES.

31:38.497 --> 31:39.966
WHY DID SHE KICK HIM OUT?

31:39.999 --> 31:41.968
- MOM CAUGHT HIM
EYEBALLING THE DAUGHTER.

31:42.001 --> 31:44.070
- GREAT.
WHERE IS HE NOW?

31:44.103 --> 31:45.437
- WE'VE GOT PLAINCLOTHES
OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL,

31:45.471 --> 31:46.973
THE AMBULETTE COMPANY--
[phone bleeping]

31:47.006 --> 31:48.040
AND WE CHECKED
HIS SERVICE PROVIDER,

31:48.074 --> 31:49.441
BUT HIS CELL IS DEAD.

31:49.475 --> 31:51.410
- DAUGHTER FIGURED OUT
WHY WE WERE THERE.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.012
SHE PROBABLY WARNED HIM

31:53.045 --> 31:55.114
BEFORE MOM HANDED OVER
BOTH THEIR CELLS.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.117
- HEY, SARGE, YOU WITH US?

31:58.150 --> 31:59.618
- YEAH.
SHE WARNED HIM?

31:59.651 --> 32:00.953
WELL, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?
STATUTORY RAPE?

32:00.987 --> 32:02.654
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.291
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS,
MOM'S HAD BETH ON A TIGHT LEASH.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.093
- TIGHT LEASH.
SHE'S A TEENAGER.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.961
EVEN IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE
A PHONE,

32:08.995 --> 32:11.097
SHE'S STILL GONNA FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.232
FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, TWITTER...

32:13.265 --> 32:16.068
- ALL RIGHT, ROLLINS.
LET'S GO.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.339
- YOU GUYS ARE WRONG.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.108
ALBERT'S BEING PERSECUTED.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.609
- HAVE YOU NOT BEEN LISTENING,
BETH?

32:23.642 --> 32:26.012
THEY ARE TELLING US
THAT ALBERT IS A RAPIST.

32:26.045 --> 32:28.347
- BETH, HE IS A DANGEROUS MAN.

32:28.380 --> 32:32.018
HE'S WANTED IN AT LEAST
SIX ASSAULTS THAT WE KNOW OF.

32:32.051 --> 32:34.020
POSSIBLY MORE.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.355
SO IF YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS,
WE NEED YOU TO TELL US.

32:36.388 --> 32:39.025
- HOW WOULD I KNOW?
- OH, DON'T EVEN TRY.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.226
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.394
- WE KNOW ABOUT THE TEXTS,
THE SEXTING.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.662
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH YOUR PHONE.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.531
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO GIVE IT
TO THEM.

32:45.564 --> 32:46.999
- IT'S IN MY NAME.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.367
I TOLD YOU
YOU COULD'VE STARTED PAYING

32:48.400 --> 32:50.102
YOUR OWN BILLS AT ANY TIME.

32:50.136 --> 32:53.239
- BETH, HE IS THE ONE
WHO'S AT FAULT HERE.

32:53.272 --> 32:56.308
OKAY, WE JUST NEED YOU
TO HELP US OUT.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.577
- YOU LOOKED AT MY MESSAGES?

32:58.610 --> 33:01.180
MY SELFIES?

33:01.213 --> 33:03.315
THAT'S PRIVATE.

33:03.349 --> 33:06.685
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

33:06.718 --> 33:10.056
THAT IS CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.790
THAT'S A FELONY.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.525
AND YOU CREATED IT,
YOU SENT IT,

33:13.559 --> 33:15.361
SO IT'S GONNA BE
YOUR JAIL TIME.

33:15.394 --> 33:17.529
- WHAT?

33:17.563 --> 33:18.797
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.432
- ACTUALLY, WE CAN.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.136
- MOM.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.105
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YES.

33:26.138 --> 33:28.140
AND, MS. BURNS, SINCE THE PHONE
IS IN YOUR NAME,

33:28.174 --> 33:29.675
WE CAN CHARGE YOU AS WELL.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.811
- BETHIE, BABY.
I'VE MISSED YOU.

34:05.844 --> 34:07.413
HOW'D YOU FINALLY
DITCH THE BITCH?

34:07.446 --> 34:09.215
- RUN.
- WHAT?

34:09.248 --> 34:10.649
- RUN.

34:10.682 --> 34:12.851
RUN!

34:12.884 --> 34:14.286
- POLICE!
- STOP! STOP!

34:14.320 --> 34:15.554
STOP!
- POLICE!

34:15.587 --> 34:16.822
- STOP!

34:22.894 --> 34:24.296
- [grunts]

34:24.330 --> 34:28.267
- GET YOUR ASS UP.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.336
- [grunts]

34:43.682 --> 34:44.150
.

34:44.183 --> 34:44.483
- [humming]

34:48.854 --> 34:56.562
* SAFE AND SECURE
FROM ALL ALARMS *

34:56.595 --> 34:59.465
[humming]

34:59.498 --> 35:00.832
- JUST LISTEN TO HIM.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.434
THIS GUY'S DONE.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.303
DNA FROM RYANN'S DOG
IS A MATCH,

35:04.336 --> 35:05.904
AND HE'S GOT BITE MARKS.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.739
- ATLANTA CONFIRMS THE DNA
IS A MATCH

35:07.773 --> 35:09.641
FOR ALL THREE OF THEIR CASES.

35:09.675 --> 35:11.910
HE RECEIVED SEVERAL SALUTATIONS
FOR HIS HEROISM

35:11.943 --> 35:13.479
DOWN THERE AS WELL,

35:13.512 --> 35:14.913
AND HE WAS ACTIVE
IN HIS CHURCH CHOIR.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.515
EXPLAINS THE HYMNS.

35:16.548 --> 35:17.883
- NOT REALLY.

35:17.916 --> 35:19.718
STILL, FIVE RAPES,
ONE ATTEMPTED.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.620
I'LL CALL BARBA.
- PLUS BETH'S SELFIES--

35:21.653 --> 35:23.189
THAT'S POSSESSION OF CHILD PORN.
HE'S LOOKING AT LIFE.

35:23.222 --> 35:24.556
- ALL RIGHT, SO CALL ATLANTA.

35:24.590 --> 35:25.824
LET THEM KNOW
WE'RE CHARGING HIM.

35:25.857 --> 35:27.459
- OH, I'M SURE THEY'RE
WAITING TO HEAR

35:27.493 --> 35:29.695
HOW THANKFUL WE ARE
FOR ALL THEIR HELP.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.530
- WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER RAPES
THAT MATCH HIS M.O.?

35:31.563 --> 35:33.799
MILWAUKEE, VEGAS--WE COULD BE
LOOKING AT A DOZEN MORE HERE.

35:33.832 --> 35:36.335
- SO CALL THEM.
ASK THEM TO TEST THE RAPE KITS.

35:36.368 --> 35:37.736
- IF THEY FIND THEM,

35:37.769 --> 35:39.871
AND THEY WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY
ON A COLD CASE.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.841
- SO WE SHORTCUT IT
AND GET A CONFESSION.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.776
- GUYS, WHY IS HE GONNA CONFESS
TO MORE?

35:44.810 --> 35:46.312
NOW, THERE'S NOTHING IN IT
FOR HIM.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.914
- YOU NEVER KNOW.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.456
- I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.192
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

36:00.226 --> 36:02.794
WE GOT YOU FOR ATTEMPTED RAPE
OF A 12-YEAR-OLD

36:02.828 --> 36:04.230
AND POSSESSION OF KIDDIE PORN.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.497
- NOW, HOLD ON.

36:05.531 --> 36:06.898
BETH SENT ME THOSE PICS.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.300
I DIDN'T ASK FOR THEM.

36:08.334 --> 36:10.402
- I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
SAYING ANYTHING.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.804
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, BABY.
I GOT ALL I NEED.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.507
YOU'RE DONE
AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.946
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

36:20.979 --> 36:25.784
- WELL, JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

36:25.817 --> 36:27.253
WE'VE GOT YOU
ON A FEW OTHER RAPES,

36:27.286 --> 36:28.920
BUT DETECTIVE TUTUOLA,

36:28.954 --> 36:30.422
HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT
TO CHARGE YOU WITH THOSE.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.858
- [laughs]
WHAT?

36:32.891 --> 36:34.326
- THERE'S SOME SENTIMENT

36:34.360 --> 36:35.661
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEND YOU
TO PRISON

36:35.694 --> 36:37.763
AS SOME SORT OF
BADASS SERIAL RAPIST

36:37.796 --> 36:39.765
WHO DODGED POLICE FOR YEARS.

36:39.798 --> 36:42.834
THAT MAYBE WE JUST CHARGE YOU
WITH THE CHILD RAPE,

36:42.868 --> 36:43.935
THE KIDDIE PORN,

36:43.969 --> 36:45.571
SEE HOW YOU FEND FOR YOURSELF.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.239
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- COME ON.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.341
YOU'RE A SMART GUY, RIGHT?

36:49.375 --> 36:51.510
YOU KEPT UP
THAT HERO EMT PROFILE

36:51.543 --> 36:54.280
FOR A LONG TIME--
YOU HAD EVERYBODY FOOLED.

36:54.313 --> 36:55.881
BUT IN PRISON,

36:55.914 --> 37:00.852
ALL ANYBODY'S GONNA KNOW
IS THAT YOU'RE JUST A PEDOPHILE.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.421
- I AM NOT A PEDOPHILE.

37:02.454 --> 37:03.689
I HAVE SEX WITH WOMEN.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.758
- YEAH, LITTLE ONES.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.894
YOU DID HOW MANY RAPES
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY?

37:08.927 --> 37:11.763
YOU GOT AWAY WITH IT FOR YEARS.

37:11.797 --> 37:12.998
PROBLEM IS,

37:13.031 --> 37:14.933
NO ONE'S EVER GONNA
DIG OUT THAT DNA,

37:14.966 --> 37:17.869
SO YOU KNOW
AND I KNOW

37:17.903 --> 37:19.738
THAT'S WHERE IT ENDS.

37:22.841 --> 37:25.544
YOUR RAP SHEET IN PRISON--

37:25.577 --> 37:27.713
THAT'S YOUR REPUTATION.

37:32.618 --> 37:33.852
- WAIT.

37:37.856 --> 37:41.493
THERE'S MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

37:41.527 --> 37:43.829
A LOT MORE.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.569
- [sighs]
YOU GOT HIM.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.938
GOOD JOB.
- NEW GUY'S OKAY.

37:52.971 --> 37:54.706
- SARGE.

37:54.740 --> 37:57.909
DODDS WANTS TO SEE YOU AT
COMPSTAT TOMORROW AT 8:00 A.M.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.445
- 8:00 A.M.?

37:59.478 --> 38:03.081
- YEAH, IT DIDN'T SOUND
LIKE A REQUEST.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.552
- [exhales]

38:06.585 --> 38:07.919
- THANK YOU FOR SEEING ME
SO EARLY.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.889
- WELL, I APPRECIATE YOU
MAKING THE TIME, SERGEANT.

38:13.559 --> 38:17.529
BEFORE I RULE ON THIS,
I WANTED TO TALK.

38:17.563 --> 38:20.432
WHAT YOU'VE TAKEN ON IS
A VERY SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITY.

38:20.466 --> 38:23.902
- I KNOW THAT,
AND I DON'T TAKE IT LIGHTLY.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.804
- TRUST ME,
THERE'S NO SHAME IN ADMITTING

38:25.837 --> 38:27.539
THAT YOU FIND YOURSELF
IN A SITUATION

38:27.573 --> 38:28.774
THAT YOU THOUGHT
YOU COULD HANDLE

38:28.807 --> 38:31.577
BUT REALIZE NOW THAT YOU CAN'T.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.812
NO ONE WILL JUDGE YOU FOR THAT.
[phone vibrating]

38:35.514 --> 38:37.616
I LIKE YOU ENORMOUSLY,
SERGEANT BENSON,

38:37.649 --> 38:40.386
BUT MY PRIMARY OBLIGATION
IS TO NOAH.

38:40.419 --> 38:43.455
- I KNOW. MINE TOO.
[vibrating continues]

38:43.489 --> 38:46.792
- DO YOU NEED TO TAKE THAT?
- NO.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.460
I DON'T.

38:49.895 --> 38:53.031
I NEED TO BE HERE.

38:53.064 --> 38:55.834
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND

38:55.867 --> 39:00.706
THAT MY PRIORITY
IS NOAH'S WELL-BEING.

39:00.739 --> 39:04.109
HIS HEALTH,
HIS HAPPINESS...

39:04.142 --> 39:07.012
I COULD NOT LOVE HIM MORE,

39:07.045 --> 39:08.947
AND I WILL DO
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

39:08.980 --> 39:12.918
TO PROVE THAT TO YOU
AND TO CHILD SERVICES.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.387
I PROMISE.

39:15.421 --> 39:16.922
- DON'T PROMISE ME.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.790
PROMISE NOAH.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.597
- CUTTING IT CLOSE.
- I'M HERE. I'M HERE.

39:25.631 --> 39:26.965
- SO ARE THEY.

39:29.435 --> 39:30.736
- AS OF THIS MORNING,

39:30.769 --> 39:33.405
THE PATTERN 17 RAPIST
HAS CONFESSED

39:33.439 --> 39:35.407
TO THREE ASSAULTS
HERE IN NEW YORK,

39:35.441 --> 39:39.044
AND 28 OTHER RAPES
IN MULTIPLE CITIES.

39:39.077 --> 39:42.080
THERE MAY BE MORE.
WE'RE STILL VERIFYING THAT.

39:42.113 --> 39:44.015
- WITH THAT MANY ASSAULTS
IN HIS HISTORY,

39:44.049 --> 39:45.917
WHAT COULD SVU
HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?

39:45.951 --> 39:47.753
- WE DID OUR JOBS.

39:47.786 --> 39:50.188
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY,
THE FACT IS,

39:50.221 --> 39:53.091
IS THAT WE ARE RELIANT
ON OTHER JURISDICTIONS

39:53.124 --> 39:55.561
WHEN THEIR PERPETRATORS
CROSS OVER INTO OURS.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.195
- SO IT SOUNDS LIKE
COMMUNICATION

39:57.228 --> 39:58.630
WITH THESE OTHER
POLICE DEPARTMENTS

39:58.664 --> 39:59.931
NEEDS TO IMPROVE.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.199
- IF I MAY,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

40:01.232 --> 40:04.436
THE PROBLEM IS
NOT COMMUNICATION, HANK.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.438
THERE'S A NATIONAL
RAPE KIT BACKLOG ISSUE HERE

40:06.472 --> 40:08.774
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.942
SERGEANT?

40:10.976 --> 40:13.178
- WE DID CATCH
THE PATTERN 17 RAPIST

40:13.211 --> 40:16.948
WITHIN ONE WEEK
AFTER HIS FIRST ASSAULT HERE.

40:16.982 --> 40:20.886
BUT THE BRUTAL TRUTH IS, IS THAT
ALL OF THE NEW YORK ASSAULTS

40:20.919 --> 40:23.889
COULD HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE
BEEN PREVENTED.

40:23.922 --> 40:27.826
ALBERT BECK
IS A CAREER RAPIST

40:27.859 --> 40:29.928
WHO HAS MOVED
FROM STATE TO STATE,

40:29.961 --> 40:31.830
YEAR AFTER YEAR.

40:31.863 --> 40:35.834
BUT BECAUSE MANY CITIES
HAVE UNDER-FUNDED DEPARTMENTS,

40:35.867 --> 40:41.707
AND MANY CITIES DO NOT REGARD
CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN SERIOUSLY,

40:41.740 --> 40:45.076
THEY NEVER TESTED
THOUSANDS OF THEIR RAPE KITS.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.512
WHAT IS THE POINT

40:46.545 --> 40:49.815
OF HAVING
A NATIONAL DNA DATABASE

40:49.848 --> 40:53.952
IF THE RAPISTS' DNA
IS NEVER ENTERED INTO IT?

40:56.888 --> 40:59.591
- ASIDE FROM THE DNA MATCH,
WE GOT A CONFESSION,

40:59.625 --> 41:03.194
SO ATLANTA CAN PROCEED
WITH PROSECUTION ON ALL THREE.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.696
- GREAT NEWS, AMANDA.

41:04.730 --> 41:06.865
I'M GLAD WE WERE ABLE TO HELP.

41:06.898 --> 41:11.570
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU AND I
STILL WORK REAL WELL TOGETHER.

41:11.603 --> 41:12.904
- OKAY, CHIEF.
I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.573
I'LL LET YOU GO.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.207
- BY THE WAY,
I'LL BE COMING UP THERE

41:16.241 --> 41:18.109
IN JANUARY FOR A CONFERENCE.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.646
MAYBE WE COULD GET A DRINK
FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

41:24.616 --> 41:26.284
- MAYBE.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.919
UH, IT IS LONG HOURS.

41:27.953 --> 41:30.622
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU KNOW HOW I AM.

41:30.656 --> 41:32.624
I DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

41:32.658 --> 41:34.960
[laughing]
I'LL SEE YOU SOON, AMANDA.

41:38.964 --> 41:40.632
- EVERYTHING OKAY?

41:43.969 --> 41:46.237
- IT'S ALL GOOD, FIN.

41:46.271 --> 41:48.006
IT'S ALL GOOD.
