WEBVTT

00:09.978 --> 00:12.312
Mm, he's, uh...

00:12.373 --> 00:14.625
he's on his way, I
just texted him, so...

00:14.626 --> 00:18.712
- Did he text you back?
- Nope.

00:18.713 --> 00:20.547
Nope.

00:20.548 --> 00:22.883
All right, everybody. Start to shut up.

00:22.884 --> 00:25.177
Ralph, what brings you here?

00:25.178 --> 00:27.471
You're late. I'm...
I'm covering for you.

00:27.472 --> 00:30.390
It's school policy. You can't
leave these students unattended.

00:30.391 --> 00:32.226
Is that a real rule? That's nuts.

00:32.226 --> 00:34.311
He literally leaves
us alone all the time.

00:34.312 --> 00:36.063
Uh, narc much?

00:36.064 --> 00:38.440
Just... just try to be on time.

00:38.441 --> 00:41.902
All right, yeah. Totally.

00:41.903 --> 00:43.821
Come on, dude.

00:43.822 --> 00:47.533
Is it... ah! Just gonna get some, uh...

00:47.534 --> 00:48.909
Hey!

00:48.910 --> 00:50.661
Jack, where are you goin'?

00:50.662 --> 00:53.497
- Uh, I need SunChips.
- We just discussed this.

00:53.498 --> 00:55.666
You... you can't just leave
because you want chips.

00:55.667 --> 00:57.417
Ah, come on.

01:04.551 --> 01:06.718
So I had an interesting morning.

01:06.719 --> 01:08.595
As I was pulling out of
my dead mom's driveway,

01:08.596 --> 01:11.849
I turned on my number one
NPR voice crush, Terry Gross,

01:11.850 --> 01:14.935
only to find that she was
interviewing my rival, Miles.

01:14.936 --> 01:16.603
I was so distracted by this injustice

01:16.604 --> 01:19.106
that I accidentally
backed over a possum.

01:19.107 --> 01:20.482
Specifically, his lower half.

01:20.483 --> 01:22.609
He was flat from about here down.

01:22.610 --> 01:24.403
And he was shouting, uh, a lot.

01:24.404 --> 01:26.196
And this presented
me with an interesting

01:26.197 --> 01:27.739
philosophical dilemma.

01:27.740 --> 01:30.909
Was it kinder to let
this animal slowly die

01:30.910 --> 01:34.121
or to bash it to death
with a big wrench?

01:34.122 --> 01:35.747
And once I'd done so, I turned and saw

01:35.748 --> 01:37.040
that one of the possum's relatives

01:37.041 --> 01:38.250
was staring right at me.

01:38.251 --> 01:39.793
He witnessed the entire thing.

01:39.794 --> 01:43.089
This presented me with another
beautiful philosophical dilemma.

01:43.590 --> 01:47.134
Was it kinder to let this
new possum be driven mad

01:47.135 --> 01:49.136
by what he'd seen, or
do I bash him to death

01:49.137 --> 01:50.971
with a giant wrench as well?

01:50.972 --> 01:52.598
Needless to say, my morning became

01:52.599 --> 01:54.433
a veritable killing field situation.

01:54.434 --> 01:59.146
And now I'm going to have to
power wash my dead mom's driveway.

01:59.147 --> 02:01.190
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

02:01.191 --> 02:02.983
Sounds like you were lashing out

02:02.984 --> 02:04.693
'cause you were angry that
Miles has a best-seller.

02:04.694 --> 02:06.320
Marcus, you of all people
should be able to discern

02:06.321 --> 02:07.946
when I'm lashing out.

02:07.947 --> 02:09.781
Maybe you should write
your own best-seller.

02:09.782 --> 02:11.575
I've considered that.

02:11.576 --> 02:13.076
It's just difficult to get
any work done in this town,

02:13.077 --> 02:15.914
with its possums and their screams.

02:17.749 --> 02:20.667
There was so much... screaming.

02:25.507 --> 02:26.507
I need SunChips.

02:28.510 --> 02:30.260
One, two, three, four!

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.860 --> 02:48.362
Book ideas? You writing a book, Jack?

02:48.363 --> 02:50.489
Oh, just getting down some thoughts.

02:50.490 --> 02:52.324
Oh, you know what kind of books I like?

02:52.325 --> 02:55.118
- Sex mysteries.
- Mm-hmm. Like "Gone Girl"

02:55.119 --> 02:56.703
- and "Girl on the Train."
- Mm-hmm.

02:56.704 --> 03:00.207
Anything where there's a girl and
she's missing or ideally, dead.

03:00.208 --> 03:02.125
Yes, yes. Ooh, okay, so you know what

03:02.126 --> 03:03.293
your book could be about?

03:03.294 --> 03:04.670
Three women who are best friends,

03:04.671 --> 03:06.880
but then the Asian one gets taken.

03:06.881 --> 03:08.549
For sex.

03:08.550 --> 03:10.884
- Jack, come on!
- Oops.

03:10.885 --> 03:12.052
- Ooh!
- Busted.

03:12.053 --> 03:13.637
Dirty man!

03:13.638 --> 03:15.681
This policy is there
for your protection.

03:15.682 --> 03:18.392
You're responsible if something
happens to one of your students

03:18.393 --> 03:20.060
while you're out toodling around.

03:20.061 --> 03:21.562
Ralph, Ralph, these kids are teenagers.

03:21.563 --> 03:23.522
You think they can't be
left alone for two seconds?

03:23.523 --> 03:25.107
Go!

03:25.108 --> 03:28.735
Are you okay? What happened?

03:28.736 --> 03:30.487
How did this happen?

03:30.488 --> 03:32.906
He fell. We were playing
Jelly Bean Quidditch.

03:32.907 --> 03:34.533
Yeah, it's where you stand on your desk

03:34.534 --> 03:36.076
and throw jelly beans
in each other's mouths.

03:36.077 --> 03:38.078
How is that Quidditch?
Where's the golden snitch?

03:38.079 --> 03:40.080
- So nerdy.
- Ah... it... nerdy.

03:40.081 --> 03:41.748
Victor? Victor?

03:41.749 --> 03:43.709
You okay, buddy? You wanna hop up there?

03:43.710 --> 03:45.252
You know, this all happened

03:45.253 --> 03:46.712
because Mr. Griffin left us unattended.

03:46.713 --> 03:48.672
He can't do that. School policy.

03:48.673 --> 03:51.425
Yes, Sarika, thank you for taking

03:51.426 --> 03:53.176
what I said earlier
and shouting it at me.

03:53.177 --> 03:55.638
Okay, let's take this to my office.

03:58.349 --> 04:00.392
Concussion test.

04:00.393 --> 04:02.728
Pupils not dilated.

04:02.729 --> 04:06.315
Eyelashes are gorgeous. That
is not fair. Gimme, gimme.

04:06.316 --> 04:08.900
Impulse control. On the count of three,

04:08.901 --> 04:10.944
look right into here
and do not blink, okay?

04:10.945 --> 04:12.362
Wah!

04:12.363 --> 04:14.031
Okay, this is bad. All right, Victor

04:14.032 --> 04:16.199
could be hurt, the
school could get sued.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.784
It's... it's like you only care

04:17.785 --> 04:19.577
- about yourself, Jack.
- Technically, deep down,

04:19.579 --> 04:21.245
we all only care about ourselves.

04:21.247 --> 04:23.290
- Psychological egoism.
- Well, you know what?

04:23.291 --> 04:25.626
I happen to care about this school.

04:25.627 --> 04:27.210
But... but yeah, you don't respect that.

04:27.211 --> 04:28.462
And... and frankly, I don't...

04:28.463 --> 04:29.796
I don't think you respect me.

04:29.797 --> 04:31.590
Oh, come on, Ralph. You know we coo.

04:31.591 --> 04:34.301
No, I don't know that. Are we coo?

04:34.302 --> 04:36.136
I'm gonna take Victor back to class.

04:36.137 --> 04:39.306
He's still a bit slow, but I
think that was already there.

04:39.307 --> 04:41.600
Ah, yeah.

04:41.601 --> 04:43.143
Wait, who's with the kids right now?

04:43.144 --> 04:44.978
Oh, God, we left them alone again!

04:44.979 --> 04:46.938
- That's hilarious.
- Jack, plea...

04:46.939 --> 04:49.316
- Helen, go cover for me.
- I also called

04:49.317 --> 04:52.110
the teacher's union and
the rep is here to see Jack.

04:52.111 --> 04:54.154
Which one... wa... not Kim.

04:54.155 --> 04:56.490
Not Kim. Oh, God, please not Kim.

04:56.491 --> 04:58.158
Not Kim, please, not Kim.

04:58.159 --> 05:00.786
Hey! Kim! What's up?

05:00.787 --> 05:02.329
Jack, don't say another word.

05:02.330 --> 05:04.749
- Ralph, get out.
- The room is yours.

05:07.585 --> 05:09.670
- Tums?
- No, I'm good.

05:09.671 --> 05:11.254
I'm freakin' addicted.

05:11.255 --> 05:14.800
My name is Kim Burke
and as your union rep,

05:14.801 --> 05:17.928
I am always on the side of the teacher.

05:17.929 --> 05:20.931
I don't care if you did kill that kid.

05:20.932 --> 05:22.766
I don't wanna know.

05:22.767 --> 05:25.018
As I see it, you have two options.

05:25.019 --> 05:27.354
Or, as I like to call them...

05:27.355 --> 05:28.605
doors.

05:28.606 --> 05:29.981
Huh?

05:29.982 --> 05:31.858
Door number one:

05:31.859 --> 05:34.695
admit you're at fault, take a one week,

05:34.696 --> 05:36.279
unpaid suspension.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.825
However, this could go
on your permanent record.

05:39.826 --> 05:41.660
- So...
- Eh.

05:41.661 --> 05:46.456
Then there's door... or option... two.

05:46.457 --> 05:47.791
We fight it!

05:47.792 --> 05:50.377
You should know, this
could take a while.

05:50.378 --> 05:52.963
Because there will be an investigation.

05:52.964 --> 05:54.631
Right, and while all that's going on,

05:54.632 --> 05:56.800
you won't be allowed
back in that classroom.

05:56.801 --> 05:58.385
Say more about that.

05:58.386 --> 06:00.220
You'd be in something
called teacher jail,

06:00.221 --> 06:02.723
which is basically a trailer
where you sit around all day.

06:02.724 --> 06:04.224
But that could take a couple months.

06:04.225 --> 06:06.226
That's a long time to not get paid.

06:06.227 --> 06:08.353
Oh, who said that? You would get paid.

06:08.354 --> 06:10.397
Full salary.

06:10.398 --> 06:11.898
You know what?

06:11.899 --> 06:13.942
It feels wrong sweeping
this under the rug.

06:13.943 --> 06:15.902
I'd be willing to stay in that damn jail

06:15.903 --> 06:18.071
for as long as it takes
to make this right.

06:18.072 --> 06:19.865
Say the words, Jack,

06:19.866 --> 06:24.536
and I will unleash the dogs.

06:24.537 --> 06:26.329
Kim...

06:26.330 --> 06:29.667
unleash the dogs.

06:36.092 --> 06:37.527
This is teacher jail.

06:38.511 --> 06:41.513
Yeah, I bet I can guess
what some of these guys did.

06:41.514 --> 06:43.098
Right now, I'm taking you

06:43.099 --> 06:45.267
off my team and handing
you over to the coach.

06:45.268 --> 06:47.269
He's gonna take it from here.

06:47.270 --> 06:48.853
All right.

06:48.854 --> 06:51.314
Here's the rules, Kemosabe:

06:51.315 --> 06:52.649
Number one, every day you're here,

06:52.650 --> 06:55.444
you've gotta sign in.

06:56.445 --> 06:57.612
Sorry, I was waiting for number two.

06:57.613 --> 06:59.781
Okay. All right.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.487
How we feeling?

07:18.488 --> 07:19.988
Been through so much.

07:19.989 --> 07:21.907
That's why Principal
Durbin has entrusted me

07:21.908 --> 07:24.910
with the sacred duty
to... as he would say...

07:24.911 --> 07:26.411
just take care of it, Helen.

07:26.412 --> 07:28.246
So I went on my computer and I searched

07:28.247 --> 07:30.749
for every available sub in the district.

07:30.750 --> 07:34.128
And I think I found someone
that you're really gonna love.

07:35.546 --> 07:37.882
Come on in, don't be shy. Come on.

07:39.258 --> 07:40.842
Tada! It's me.

07:40.843 --> 07:44.095
You think I'd leave you
guys with a stranger?

07:44.096 --> 07:46.056
I'm gonna teach you what I know.

07:46.057 --> 07:48.433
Starting with the gorgeous
velveteen labyrinth

07:48.434 --> 07:51.561
that is the female reproductive system.

07:51.562 --> 07:54.356
This is my cervix.

07:54.357 --> 07:57.318
Who can tell me the five
things that are wrong with it?

07:58.277 --> 08:00.612
Okay, ladies.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.448
I'm trying to get a sense
of the culture around here.

08:03.449 --> 08:04.783
- Nobody?
- Mm-mm.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.451
All right, then.

08:06.452 --> 08:08.912
Is everybody following
the supervision policy?

08:08.913 --> 08:12.624
I do. Other people may
leave their class sometimes.

08:12.625 --> 08:15.001
Not me. Not even if I
have to use the bathroom.

08:15.002 --> 08:17.838
- I just control it.
- She's so dedicated.

08:17.839 --> 08:19.097
- Oh, she's amazing.
- She's a queen.

08:19.098 --> 08:20.132
She has pooped her
pants a couple of times.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.758
- Wait, what?
- I have.

08:21.759 --> 08:24.719
But I just borrow some red
track pants from lost and found.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.304
I wash them and put them back.

08:26.305 --> 08:29.140
- Nobody wants those now.
- Let the lost be lost.

08:29.141 --> 08:31.142
Hey! Hey, Durbin!

08:31.143 --> 08:33.645
Come back here! Durbin!

08:33.645 --> 08:35.480
Where you going?

08:35.481 --> 08:37.649
Hey, what do you got there?

08:37.650 --> 08:39.234
This?

08:39.235 --> 08:40.986
This is my dog chow.

08:40.986 --> 08:42.988
Your... your what?

08:42.989 --> 08:45.490
The dogs are loose.

08:45.491 --> 08:46.908
What... what dogs?

08:46.909 --> 08:48.660
Jack wants to fight his case.

08:48.661 --> 08:52.330
So you can just wipe that
smug look right off your face.

08:52.331 --> 08:53.748
Why do you hate me so much?

08:53.749 --> 08:55.083
Because you're weak.

08:55.084 --> 08:56.877
And I don't trust you with my teachers.

08:56.878 --> 08:59.045
You don't deserve to be their principal.

08:59.046 --> 09:00.839
Just like you didn't deserve

09:00.840 --> 09:02.591
to be captain of the Glee Club.

09:02.592 --> 09:04.843
Okay, Kim, that was 25 years ago.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.344
- I don't care!
- You gotta let it go!

09:06.345 --> 09:08.847
No! Mr. K felt sorry for you.

09:08.848 --> 09:10.932
Everybody knows it should've been...

09:16.355 --> 09:19.274
Yeah. I see you for what
you really are, Durbin.

09:19.275 --> 09:20.859
You're no leader of men.

09:20.860 --> 09:23.153
You're nothing but a cutie patootie.

09:23.154 --> 09:25.197
You know what? I may
be a cutie patootie,

09:25.198 --> 09:27.324
but I'm still the boss around here.

09:27.325 --> 09:29.451
And you were flatting. Good day.

09:30.453 --> 09:31.536
Uh!

09:31.537 --> 09:33.539
Oh, my God.

09:36.792 --> 09:38.084
Mm-mm.

09:38.085 --> 09:41.087
Wh... whatcha workin' on?

09:41.088 --> 09:45.050
Uh, I'm trying to come up
with ideas for a new book.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.886
Philosophy... but I'm not
quite sure where to begin.

09:47.887 --> 09:53.183
Plato says, "All philosophy
begins in wonder."

09:53.184 --> 09:55.560
- You know Plato.
- I dabble.

09:55.561 --> 09:59.147
- Jack.
- Oh, Philip.

09:59.148 --> 10:01.066
Homemade shortbread?

10:01.067 --> 10:03.401
Yes.

10:03.402 --> 10:05.237
Wow. Mmm.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.571
What are you here for?

10:06.572 --> 10:07.906
- You ready for this?
- Hm?

10:07.907 --> 10:09.658
I tickled some of the other teachers.

10:11.827 --> 10:13.245
- Why?
- What can I say?

10:13.246 --> 10:15.580
I'm a tickler. I love
to make people laugh,

10:15.581 --> 10:17.249
but I don't know any jokes.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.459
- Hm.
- It only takes one person,

10:19.460 --> 10:21.294
though, to call you a teacher tickler.

10:21.295 --> 10:23.421
And true or not, you're ruined.

10:23.422 --> 10:25.340
- Mm.
- You are ruined.

10:25.341 --> 10:27.425
- But it was true?
- Very much.

10:27.596 --> 10:28.930
- Mm.
- Yeah.

10:28.931 --> 10:30.932
So, what have you got
so far on this book?

10:30.933 --> 10:32.684
Ohh... I don't know.

10:32.685 --> 10:34.436
Something about the
distortion of the ego

10:34.437 --> 10:37.105
that comes from late
capitalism's denial of death.

10:37.106 --> 10:38.440
Mind if I type this down?

10:38.441 --> 10:41.276
I mean, it may help to have someone else

10:41.277 --> 10:43.778
tickle the keyboard.

10:43.779 --> 10:46.115
Yeah, I'd like that.

10:48.617 --> 10:51.870
Great. Let's dispel some common myths.

10:51.871 --> 10:53.788
Pull-out method. Don't work.

10:53.789 --> 10:55.790
Menopause, not real.

10:55.791 --> 10:58.877
Vaginal orgasm, gimme a break.

10:58.878 --> 11:01.045
I thought we were gonna
get a real teacher.

11:01.046 --> 11:02.672
You think I wanted this?

11:02.673 --> 11:05.300
I'm gonna need a volunteer. Let me see.

11:05.301 --> 11:08.136
Somebody maybe in the very, very back.

11:08.137 --> 11:11.139
How about, uh, Anthony.

11:11.140 --> 11:12.807
Come on down.

11:12.808 --> 11:15.143
Come on down, Anthony. Oh, yes.

11:15.144 --> 11:16.478
Come on. Now, Anthony,

11:16.479 --> 11:18.730
I'm gonna say a part of the female body

11:18.731 --> 11:20.815
and I want you to define
it and then I want you

11:20.816 --> 11:21.983
to point it out on me.

11:21.984 --> 11:23.151
This is gonna be fun.

11:23.152 --> 11:24.777
Sarika, you have to fix this!

11:24.778 --> 11:26.654
This is way worse than Mr. Griffin.

11:26.655 --> 11:28.323
Okay!

11:28.324 --> 11:30.825
Ms. Demarcus, can
Victor, Grace, Colin and I

11:30.826 --> 11:32.160
go to the bathroom?

11:32.161 --> 11:33.661
Yeah, the pass is on the desk.

11:33.662 --> 11:36.831
Anthony, perineum.

11:36.832 --> 11:39.627
Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

11:41.337 --> 11:43.546
Keep goin'.

11:43.547 --> 11:45.882
Mine's lower than usual. Keep goin'.

11:45.883 --> 11:48.343
But this desire for a so-called answer

11:48.344 --> 11:52.180
reflects a society
obsessed with the, um...

11:52.181 --> 11:54.516
- uhh...
- Uh, ephemeral?

11:54.517 --> 11:56.267
- Ephemeral.
- Ephemeral, yes.

11:56.268 --> 11:58.186
Yes, Philip, yes.

11:58.187 --> 12:00.188
I'll tell you, now that
I have a clear thesis,

12:00.189 --> 12:02.023
this book practically will write itself.

12:02.024 --> 12:04.359
I mean, I think we can
have a draft in a month.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.820
- I do.
- Ah, yeah.

12:07.863 --> 12:09.197
Can we talk?

12:09.198 --> 12:12.159
Uhh, yeah. One sec.

12:13.035 --> 12:16.538
Look, this thing is getting
blown way out of proportion.

12:16.539 --> 12:18.540
Jack, you know you're in the wrong.

12:18.541 --> 12:21.376
Okay, how about a one day suspension?

12:21.377 --> 12:22.710
Uh, I don't know.

12:22.711 --> 12:24.045
I mean, I think this... this policy

12:24.046 --> 12:25.755
really needs to be examined.

12:25.756 --> 12:27.090
I mean, these... these kids
are old enough to get pregnant.

12:27.091 --> 12:28.466
They can't be alone for two seconds?

12:28.467 --> 12:29.717
That's literally the reason

12:29.718 --> 12:30.802
they shouldn't be left alone.

12:30.803 --> 12:32.804
Look, it's one day, okay?

12:32.805 --> 12:34.222
How about a... a slap on the wrist,

12:34.223 --> 12:35.723
we'll put the whole thing behind us.

12:35.724 --> 12:38.059
Jack, my fingers are getting cold.

12:38.060 --> 12:40.228
Uhh, you know what? I gotta go.

12:40.229 --> 12:41.729
I'm so sorry, Ralph. I don't like this

12:41.730 --> 12:44.191
- any more than you do.
- Get...

12:50.597 --> 12:52.037
All right, Helen said we could find

12:52.933 --> 12:54.017
every sub in the district on here.

12:54.018 --> 12:55.518
If we find one we like, maybe we can

12:55.519 --> 12:57.020
go around her completely.

12:57.021 --> 12:58.855
- Colin, all clear?
- If I see anyone coming,

12:58.856 --> 13:01.190
- I'll play "Baker Street."
- What's "Baker Street"?

13:01.191 --> 13:03.860
Uh, I think you know.

13:03.861 --> 13:05.528
Here we go.

13:05.529 --> 13:07.196
Let's find the biology
teacher of our dreams.

13:07.197 --> 13:10.283
- Oh, here we go.
- I feel like he's too jacked.

13:12.453 --> 13:14.537
What the...

13:14.538 --> 13:16.622
What the heck are you
guys doing on my Dell?

13:16.623 --> 13:18.875
We're looking for a new substitute.

13:18.876 --> 13:21.794
The truth is...

13:21.795 --> 13:25.048
Principal Durbin needs
you even more than we do.

13:25.049 --> 13:29.385
Yeah. He's been through so much.

13:29.386 --> 13:30.636
Go to him, Helen.

13:30.637 --> 13:32.472
You're good kids.

13:32.473 --> 13:34.891
I'll get your substitute for you.

13:34.892 --> 13:37.727
Ralph! I got you! I got you!

13:37.728 --> 13:39.729
We convince the board
your case has merit,

13:39.730 --> 13:41.230
this thing could drag on for months.

13:41.231 --> 13:42.565
- Mm.
- You sure you're all right

13:42.566 --> 13:44.484
with being in teacher jail?

13:44.485 --> 13:46.527
It's been a weirdly
productive situation.

13:46.528 --> 13:48.362
Mr. Griffin, do you have any questions

13:48.363 --> 13:50.364
- before we begin?
- Um, yes,

13:50.365 --> 13:53.910
are there more white grapes
coming or is this all there is?

13:53.911 --> 13:56.038
Zack?

13:57.498 --> 13:59.415
That's all the grapes.

13:59.416 --> 14:02.585
Principal Durbin, your statement.

14:02.586 --> 14:05.588
Yeah, well, uh, it's...
it's pretty simple.

14:05.589 --> 14:08.508
- Boo.
- I don't think that there's any bad guys here.

14:08.509 --> 14:11.844
- We have a supervision policy.
- Sit down!

14:11.845 --> 14:14.222
- He ignored it.
- Allegedly.

14:14.223 --> 14:15.431
And Victor got hurt!

14:15.432 --> 14:17.434
Kim, your statement.

14:19.269 --> 14:23.105
I want to tell you
about the most dedicated,

14:23.106 --> 14:26.985
caring, hard-working teacher I know.

14:28.654 --> 14:31.322
Jack Griffin.

14:31.323 --> 14:36.118
I... I mean, clearly, he is
suffering and this is hard on him.

14:36.119 --> 14:38.454
Right?

14:38.455 --> 14:40.039
I miss my little sweeties.

14:40.040 --> 14:44.460
Why are we persecuting this man

14:44.461 --> 14:49.298
when clearly, the problem
at this school is this man?!

14:49.299 --> 14:51.968
Principal Ralph Durbin.

14:51.969 --> 14:54.470
Dirty Durbin.

14:54.471 --> 14:58.391
Why aren't the teachers
following the school policy?

14:58.392 --> 15:04.564
Well, maybe it's because the
principal is asleep on the job.

15:04.565 --> 15:06.482
Okay, I'm clearly blinking.

15:06.483 --> 15:08.067
Is he focused on work?

15:08.068 --> 15:11.195
Well, not according
to his Google searches.

15:11.196 --> 15:12.697
- Okay, that's private.
- I'll allow it.

15:12.698 --> 15:15.825
"Kokomo is it real"?

15:15.826 --> 15:17.493
Do we really want a principal

15:17.494 --> 15:18.995
who's daydreaming about

15:18.996 --> 15:21.497
some fake paradise in the Florida Keys?

15:21.498 --> 15:22.665
Well, why are the other ones real?

15:22.666 --> 15:27.670
- Aruba, Jamaica...
- Principal Durbin mowing the school lawn

15:27.671 --> 15:31.173
wearing what is known as a wife-beater.

15:31.174 --> 15:32.675
It was a Saturday.

15:32.676 --> 15:36.846
Oh! It's okay, everybody, to
beat your wife on a Saturday.

15:36.847 --> 15:38.097
Do we really think

15:38.098 --> 15:39.974
that Principal Durbin told Jack

15:39.975 --> 15:42.018
about the supervision policy

15:42.019 --> 15:44.353
when he can't even
remember to fix the sign

15:44.354 --> 15:46.689
in front of the school?

15:46.690 --> 15:48.357
Since I've been here this week,

15:48.358 --> 15:52.069
I've noticed nothing but a trail
of destruction on your watch.

15:52.070 --> 15:53.905
Kids falling off of desks,

15:53.906 --> 15:56.282
teachers defecating in their pants,

15:56.283 --> 16:00.036
and a Harvard professor
being micromanaged

16:00.037 --> 16:03.539
by an incompetent, little wiener.

16:03.540 --> 16:05.041
But we have a chance

16:05.042 --> 16:08.210
to be on the right side of history.

16:08.211 --> 16:10.546
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:10.547 --> 16:12.925
fire the wiener.

16:20.972 --> 16:22.139
Oh... uh, can we just...

16:22.140 --> 16:23.766
can we have a moment?

16:23.767 --> 16:25.267
Okay, thanks. Uh, Kim, can
I talk to you over here?

16:25.268 --> 16:27.478
- I'm killing it, right?
- Just...

16:27.479 --> 16:29.647
can you just ease up
on Durbin a little bit?

16:29.648 --> 16:31.524
I mean, I think we can
both agree as educators

16:31.525 --> 16:33.025
he's not the problem, it's the policy.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.361
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Cut the crap, Jack.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.488
Okay, we both know you
love teacher jail...

16:37.489 --> 16:39.823
being able to get paid
to write your little book

16:39.824 --> 16:41.492
and play grab-ass with the freaks.

16:41.493 --> 16:44.495
You punk out on me now,
and all that goes away.

16:44.496 --> 16:46.497
I'm not punking out, I'm
just saying lay off Durbin.

16:46.498 --> 16:48.999
- He's a good guy.
- It's too late, Jack.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.502
You let the dogs out.

16:51.503 --> 16:53.128
All right, everybody.

16:53.129 --> 16:55.172
On my next slide, you're gonna see

16:55.173 --> 16:59.301
Principal Durbin in full
Native American headdress.

16:59.302 --> 17:00.970
It... it was the '90s.
It wasn't bad yet.

17:00.971 --> 17:02.805
Okay, excuse me. Can
I say something here?

17:02.806 --> 17:03.973
- Uh-uh, sit down!
- Just...

17:03.974 --> 17:06.517
I have something to say, okay?

17:06.518 --> 17:08.685
Kim...

17:08.686 --> 17:11.355
Uh... tickled me.

17:11.356 --> 17:13.566
What?!

17:13.567 --> 17:16.694
- I'm sorry.
- She's a teacher tickler.

17:16.694 --> 17:18.654
Yeah, she would wait
until we were all alone

17:18.655 --> 17:20.823
and then she would just
go bananas all over me,

17:20.824 --> 17:22.031
tickling me up and down.

17:22.032 --> 17:23.784
Yep.

17:23.785 --> 17:26.537
So take her away.

17:26.538 --> 17:28.873
What are you talking
about? Jack, tickling is not

17:28.874 --> 17:30.541
a punishable offense.

17:30.542 --> 17:32.209
I'd call it lightly frowned upon,

17:32.210 --> 17:34.503
or awkward... if people are watching.

17:34.504 --> 17:37.965
What... so no one cares
that she tickled me?

17:37.966 --> 17:40.384
Well then why is Philip,
the frickin' best guy I know

17:40.385 --> 17:41.844
in teacher jail right now?

17:41.845 --> 17:43.888
That guy did more than just tickle.

17:43.889 --> 17:45.055
Oh. What else did he do.

17:45.056 --> 17:47.224
Uh, well, he...

17:47.225 --> 17:48.392
- Dated.
- Yes.

17:48.393 --> 17:50.561
He dated the CPR dummy.

17:50.562 --> 17:52.730
Uhh, okay, you know what?
Look, I'm just gonna...

17:52.731 --> 17:55.065
I'm gonna come clean here.

17:55.066 --> 17:56.942
I was out of the room
when the nerd fell,

17:56.943 --> 17:58.944
and Ralph warned me about it.

17:58.945 --> 18:04.074
It's totally my fault. So
can we just be done here?

18:04.075 --> 18:06.535
All right, Mr. Griffin
is docked three days pay.

18:06.536 --> 18:08.537
Yeah, and must remain in teacher jail...

18:08.538 --> 18:10.080
And will return to his
classroom immediately.

18:10.081 --> 18:11.415
Ahh.

18:11.416 --> 18:13.585
This is not over, Durbin.

18:22.093 --> 18:24.094
My name is Mr. Vining.

18:24.095 --> 18:28.057
I am your new teacher, and I...

18:28.058 --> 18:30.601
love biology.

18:30.602 --> 18:32.603
Pretty soon, you're
gonna love it as well.

18:32.604 --> 18:34.730
But not just love it,

18:34.731 --> 18:37.484
you're going to understand it.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.986
So let's not waste another moment.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.738
Our story begins

18:42.739 --> 18:46.951
3.8 billion years ago.

18:46.952 --> 18:49.286
In a humble puddle of amino acid.

18:49.287 --> 18:53.874
You may wanna write that down.

18:53.875 --> 18:55.459
All right, chief.

18:55.460 --> 18:58.462
I appreciate it, but I got it from here.

18:58.463 --> 19:01.091
Oh. Okay.

19:02.592 --> 19:05.260
- Well, uh, fair enough.
- Yep.

19:05.261 --> 19:08.472
All right.

19:08.473 --> 19:10.600
Wait.

19:13.478 --> 19:15.980
Well, I'm back.

19:15.981 --> 19:17.147
Did you guys miss me?

19:17.148 --> 19:19.024
Yeah? Little bit?

19:19.025 --> 19:22.027
By the way, I know what y'all did.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.989
And, uh, no hard feelings.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.490
What do you mean?

19:26.491 --> 19:27.950
That little accident with Victor,

19:27.951 --> 19:29.326
I know you staged it.

19:29.327 --> 19:30.786
It was just...

19:30.787 --> 19:32.287
it was a little bit too convenient.

19:32.288 --> 19:33.497
You know, the way Victor

19:33.498 --> 19:35.499
fell just after Durbin mentioned

19:35.500 --> 19:37.793
the supervision policy.

19:37.794 --> 19:39.586
But I know Victor...

19:39.587 --> 19:41.797
sweet, simple Victor couldn't come up

19:41.798 --> 19:43.173
with a plan like that on his own.

19:43.174 --> 19:45.176
He probably had a little bit of help.

19:47.012 --> 19:49.013
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:49.014 --> 19:50.806
"I don't know what
you're talking about."

19:50.807 --> 19:53.350
Sure you don't.

19:53.351 --> 19:55.519
Well, I gotta say, Serika,
you know, I'm impressed.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.479
Yeah, yeah, sometimes I forget

19:57.480 --> 19:59.189
that even though you're
all dumber than me,

19:59.190 --> 20:01.900
there's still some value
to your little brains.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.028
Kinda cool.

20:04.029 --> 20:06.823
Well, it's good to be back.

20:08.158 --> 20:11.536
Oh. Who's this little guy?

20:19.377 --> 20:23.881
So... guess you heard I got out.

20:23.882 --> 20:25.883
Guess you heard I'm not just a tickler.

20:25.884 --> 20:28.343
Philip, stop.

20:28.344 --> 20:31.180
You don't need to explain
a damn thing to me.

20:31.181 --> 20:32.890
You're not mad?

20:32.891 --> 20:35.559
Well, I'm... I'm mad you
didn't tell me the truth.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.394
There's no secrets between us.

20:37.395 --> 20:39.730
And what is a friend, but a single soul

20:39.731 --> 20:41.231
dwelling in two bodies.

20:41.232 --> 20:44.443
Aristotle. My favorite philosopher.

20:44.444 --> 20:49.031
Well, second favorite now.

20:49.032 --> 20:51.700
Come here, you dumb perv.

20:54.079 --> 20:55.412
Ahh!

20:55.413 --> 20:57.081
Oh, come on!

20:57.082 --> 20:59.374
Oh, you are so bad.
