00:02.919 --> 00:04.921
(narrator): Previously on Ride.

00:04.963 --> 00:07.632
-You gotta help me, okay?
Or our family could be
in a lot of trouble.

00:07.674 --> 00:11.219
I know your secret.
- JB Wooten wants to meet you.

00:11.261 --> 00:14.931
- This company has owned us
for far too long and I am not
giving them another son.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.850
(shouting)
- There is another option.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.601
It might help dig you out.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.854
- I saw you ride at the stock
show. You're incredible.

00:20.895 --> 00:23.732
- Thank you.
- You're back.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.109
- I heard you're looking
for some new brand ambassadors.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.028
- You need to know,
the job's outta Houston.

00:28.069 --> 00:30.572
- I'm asking you to stay
and be his coach.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.494
(cows bellowing)

00:36.536 --> 00:39.080
(mellow music)

00:41.041 --> 00:44.711
- All right, what do you like
most about rodeo?

00:44.753 --> 00:45.920
- Bull riding.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.839
- Bull-- Aren't you
a trick rider?

00:47.881 --> 00:52.469
- Yes, but I am surrounded
by a family of bull riders

00:52.510 --> 00:55.055
who inspire me to be fearless
in everything I do.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.515
- Now I hear that middle one,
is it, Cash, is it?

00:57.557 --> 00:59.476
I hear
he's especially inspiring.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.728
- Mm, yes, so inspiring.
- Oh, yeah.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.271
(chuckling)

01:03.313 --> 01:04.939
- All right, come on,
gimme a hardball.

01:04.981 --> 01:06.733
- A hard one?
- Yes.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.109
(clearing throat)

01:08.151 --> 01:09.611
- All right.

01:09.652 --> 01:12.655
Chad Radcliffe here,
from the Daily Rider.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.742
Eh, Missy, where do you see
yourself in five years?

01:15.784 --> 01:18.578
- Hmm. In five years?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.497
Running for office.

01:20.538 --> 01:22.916
Crafting policies that allow
ranchers to protect their lands.

01:22.957 --> 01:25.460
- All right, that sounds like
something Valeria would say.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.087
- What? It's what
they want to hear.

01:27.128 --> 01:30.465
- So what? Come on.
Real answer.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.384
(inhaling deeply)

01:33.426 --> 01:35.637
- Real answer?
- Mm-hmm.

01:36.846 --> 01:42.060
- Where do I see myself in...
five years? Um...

01:42.102 --> 01:44.688
(gentle music)

01:44.729 --> 01:46.564
Right here.

01:46.606 --> 01:50.527
Look around. What...
What else more do I need?

01:52.112 --> 01:54.823
- What about them
dancing horses from Spain?

01:55.782 --> 01:57.492
Andasomething?

01:57.534 --> 01:59.494
- Andalusians.
- Andalusians.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.870
- Yeah.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.831
- Isn't that a dream of yours?

02:04.708 --> 02:07.293
- Yeah. How do you know
about that?

02:07.335 --> 02:09.963
- When you talk, I listen.
(giggling)

02:10.005 --> 02:12.424
And then you talk some more.
(chuckling)

02:13.675 --> 02:15.719
I know these last few months
have not been easy

02:15.760 --> 02:18.763
but getting to spend
all this time together...

02:20.432 --> 02:21.641
hasn't been terrible.

02:21.683 --> 02:25.353
- No. It certainly
hasn't been terrible.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.522
(Isabel shouting):
Guys, Austin's back!

02:32.068 --> 02:33.361
- Hey, y'all!

02:33.403 --> 02:36.990
Look what the cat dragged in!
(chuckling)

02:37.032 --> 02:39.200
- Ah! I'm so proud of you.
- Hello, Mama.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.786
- Oh, I didn't know he...

02:43.121 --> 02:46.041
- You were about
to tell me something.

02:46.082 --> 02:48.835
(tender music)

02:48.877 --> 02:50.378
- Just...

02:52.047 --> 02:54.466
I, I think you're gonna be
the best

02:54.507 --> 02:56.843
Miss Rodeo Rocky Mountain
there's ever been.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.558
- Yeah, well...

03:03.600 --> 03:06.728
(inhaling deeply)
I had a great coach.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.066
(subdued music)

03:11.107 --> 03:12.567
(Missy shouting): Hey, Austin!

03:12.609 --> 03:14.444
(sighs)

03:14.486 --> 03:15.695
- Coach?

03:15.737 --> 03:17.530
What, you want Missy
to be my coach?

03:17.572 --> 03:19.616
- Yep, she did it for Austin,
she can do it for you.

03:19.657 --> 03:22.077
- I don't need a coach.
What I need is a new bull.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.661
- What's wrong with Renegade?

03:23.703 --> 03:25.455
- Mom, if I'm gonna compete
for the sponsorship,

03:25.497 --> 03:27.957
I'm gonna need to practise
on a championship bull.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.418
- Well, I'm sorry but the ranch
has other priorities right now.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.545
- No, it wouldn't-- it would
just be a loan, all right?

03:32.587 --> 03:34.381
I already talked to stock
contractor, friend of yours
over in Denver--

03:34.422 --> 03:36.508
I know it's not what you want
but it's what I need.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.468
- Hey, hey. No, you don't know
what I want. Listen, listen,

03:38.510 --> 03:41.012
you practically had a panic
attack in that chute

03:41.054 --> 03:43.556
and Missy was the only person
who could get your head on
straight.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.851
- Yeah, but it was Cash who held
on for those eight seconds.

03:46.893 --> 03:50.772
- Yeah, only because
he had Coach here to guide him.
Isn't that right, Cash?

03:50.814 --> 03:52.691
- What about your Frontier gig
in Houston?

03:52.732 --> 03:54.567
Don't tell me you're gonna give
that up to--

03:54.609 --> 03:57.112
- No, I'm just gonna tell them
that I have to do it from here.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.738
Just until you get
that sponsorship.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.700
- Ma, I don't know
what you told Valeria,

04:01.741 --> 04:03.618
but it's barely morning,
she's already sent me

04:03.660 --> 04:06.371
14 messages with her ideas about
shaking things up around here.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.415
- Seems to be going around.

04:08.456 --> 04:10.667
- Mornin'.
- Hey, morning.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.752
Sounds like you've already been
really productive.

04:12.794 --> 04:16.172
- Fourteen?
- I didn't mean to overstep.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.550
- You're not, listen,
I asked for your ideas

04:18.591 --> 04:20.885
to "shake things up
around here."

04:20.927 --> 04:23.430
That is, if we want to be
living here next year.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.306
- Well, good news is,

04:25.348 --> 04:27.308
I know a guy who needs
to offload some sheep.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.352
- Well, you know a guy who needs
to offload some bulls?

04:29.394 --> 04:32.647
- Hey, you know what?
I don't think y'all realize
how deep in the red we are.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.774
Go on,
tell me about those sheep.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.068
- Well, they'll help
with weed abatement.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.778
- Mm-hmm.
- Cut costs.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.613
Come spring we sell their wool,
make a profit.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.699
- Sounds like a lot of hoops.
We can sell some cattle

04:42.741 --> 04:44.451
and make a bigger,
quicker profit.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.994
- Well, let's look into both.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.954
Valeria, why don't you see
what kind of deal you can cut?

04:47.996 --> 04:50.707
- Okay and I can start
hittin' the local rodeos,
pullin' in some wins.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.460
- No. We can't have you
getting hurt before
your big ride in Cheyenne.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.795
You'll be trading millions
for pocket change.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.006
- Cheyenne's in five months.
- So?

04:58.048 --> 04:59.716
- Well, I'd listen
to your coach.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.843
(chuckling)

05:02.802 --> 05:04.387
(tense music)

05:04.429 --> 05:07.515
* Here comes the mighty storm *

05:07.557 --> 05:10.810
* The white lightning's gonna
strike you down *

05:10.852 --> 05:13.772
* You can't fight
the Will of the Lord *

05:13.813 --> 05:17.067
* Everybody stand ready
on higher ground *

05:17.108 --> 05:18.610
(sighs)

05:26.201 --> 05:28.119
Hey.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.704
Yeah,
we're still out of pocket.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.750
No, no. I'm not ready to sell.

05:35.210 --> 05:38.046
(sighing)
We need a plan B.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.715
* Here comes the mighty storm **

05:44.260 --> 05:47.430
(mellow music)

05:51.601 --> 05:54.813
- All right. Let's talk about
this whole coaching thing.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.439
(horses neighing)

05:56.481 --> 05:58.400
- You think it's a good idea?

05:59.567 --> 06:01.486
- Cash, nobody is doubting
how good you are.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.530
It's not about that.

06:03.571 --> 06:06.783
Which is why I'm gonna tell
Frontier Jeans that I need
to be here.

06:06.825 --> 06:10.286
Because with my help,
you could be a star.

06:10.328 --> 06:13.206
- No one questioned Austin,
no one said
Austin needed a coach.

06:13.248 --> 06:14.708
- He had a coach.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.835
Me. I just didn't
get the credit for it.

06:16.876 --> 06:20.422
Do you know how many hours
of riding I have analyzed?

06:20.463 --> 06:21.965
- You're more than qualified,
I get it.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.550
- Then what?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.761
- You want me to be great?

06:27.637 --> 06:29.431
Help me get that bull.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.518
(indistinct chatter)

06:34.769 --> 06:36.813
- Hey, I didn't mean
to undermine you back there.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.816
- Well, my ways work,

06:39.858 --> 06:42.485
but with the price of seed
and feed climbing
through the roof

06:42.527 --> 06:45.280
and without Austin's sponsorship
money as a buffer...

06:45.321 --> 06:46.948
- Tuff, no one's blaming you.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.742
I'm just trying
to be creative here.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.661
- Are you gonna be around
to execute all this creativity?

06:54.998 --> 06:56.291
(scoffs)

06:56.332 --> 06:58.835
- Look, Hank. I know
you got a town to run.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.962
- Always happy
to lend a hand, Bel.

07:01.004 --> 07:04.090
But look, if I'm gonna convince
this guy to invest
in this place,

07:04.132 --> 07:06.593
I need to know you're serious.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.553
- I didn't come this far
to be left with nothing.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.639
- Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.353
You've poured too much into
McMurray Ranch to have it taken
away by some bank.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.938
You deserve to retire
with a healthy nest egg.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.648
- Retire?
(scoffing)

07:20.690 --> 07:22.984
Wait, do I look like
the retiring type?

07:23.026 --> 07:26.738
- Retirement and stability,
they're not dirty words, Bel.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.114
(scoffs)

07:28.156 --> 07:30.533
Finding an investor might be
good for the whole town.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.078
You bring one money man in
and the rest follow.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.872
Before you know it,
Canyon's the next Bozeman.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.958
- That may be all well and good
for your next campaign, Hank

07:39.000 --> 07:43.004
but the only win I'm concerned
about is what's best
for my family.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.216
And if you are going
to broker this deal...

07:48.259 --> 07:51.054
...I need to know
you're on my side.

07:51.096 --> 07:55.100
- Darlin', I have had your back
since grade school.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.519
Don't you dare question
my loyalty to you.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.105
I just might be too darn loyal.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.856
(gentle music)

08:02.899 --> 08:03.817
- Okay.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.652
(upbeat music)

08:05.694 --> 08:07.904
(indistinct chatter)

08:09.489 --> 08:11.783
- Well, what do you think?

08:11.825 --> 08:15.078
- It certainly is different
than the rest.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.707
- You know, it's only our
sponsored athletes that get
this kind of exposure.

08:18.748 --> 08:22.377
Given your former proximity
to one, we...

08:22.419 --> 08:25.588
You do want to be
our brand ambassador, yes?

08:25.630 --> 08:28.174
You want to help us sell
some jeans?
'Cause this is how it's done.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.678
- Well, of course. But it does
turn out that I am needed
at Austin's ranch

08:31.720 --> 08:33.638
and I know how close you feel
to the family.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.640
- Missy, we had a deal.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.517
- And I'm not trying
to back out,

08:37.559 --> 08:39.686
I'm just hoping maybe
we can do this from Canyon.

08:39.728 --> 08:41.354
Which is a great little town,
by the way.

08:41.396 --> 08:44.315
- Canyon?
Population of...?

08:44.357 --> 08:45.984
- Seventeen thousand,
give or take.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.862
- And precisely
no Frontier stores.

08:48.903 --> 08:52.407
Missy, we have spent tons
of money on this campaign,
on you.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.993
And it was on the understanding
you'd be willing to relocate.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.537
Now, if that's off the table,
maybe we need to re-evaluate.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.874
- Uh, exactly, maybe
we do need to re-evaluate

09:00.915 --> 09:02.709
how we approach this campaign.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.962
Canyon is the home
of the McMurray Ranch.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.007
It's where Dusty McMurray
redefined bull riding,

09:09.049 --> 09:11.634
where Austin grew up to be
the best of his generation.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.721
This could be an opportunity
for Frontier.

09:14.763 --> 09:17.766
A sneak peek into
the lives of their heroes.

09:17.807 --> 09:22.145
A.K.A., Austin McMurray's widow,

09:22.187 --> 09:24.314
doing promos from his home.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.608
(tender music)

09:28.109 --> 09:29.861
(scoffs)

09:31.279 --> 09:34.282
- Yeah, all right, you do make
a convincing argument.

09:34.324 --> 09:37.243
- I know can double
your clickthroughs in one week.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.703
- Double?
- Mm-hmm.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.330
- Now, that's a tall order.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.915
- Well, I am a trick rider

09:41.956 --> 09:45.293
and when I see a trick
I can pull off, I take it.

09:46.461 --> 09:49.839
- All right.
I'll give you a week.

09:49.881 --> 09:53.593
- Thank you.
You won't regret it.

09:53.635 --> 09:57.389
(woman on radio): Welcome back
to, "These Boots Were Made
for Talkin'" with me, Desiree.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.642
We've been chatting about
bronc rider, Bonnie McCarroll,

10:00.684 --> 10:02.811
whose tragic death
has been blamed

10:02.852 --> 10:04.854
for keeping women
out of the sport.

10:04.896 --> 10:07.107
- Classic. Blame the victim.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.401
(Desiree on radio):
But Bonnie's husband, Frank,
a rodeo star himself,

10:09.442 --> 10:11.903
called Bonnie the best
little cook in the world.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.780
- Best bronco rider
in the country

10:13.822 --> 10:15.699
and she'll be remembered
for her casseroles.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.660
(Desiree on radio):
You can read about Bonnie
and other gutsy gals

10:18.702 --> 10:21.705
in my latest book,
"Rodeos and Juliets."

10:21.746 --> 10:24.666
I'll be doing a signing
tomorrow at Canyon Café.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.252
If you want to swing by.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.795
Speaking of swing...

10:28.837 --> 10:31.923
Here's a little ditty
to keep your toes tapping.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.136
(distant horse neighing)

10:36.177 --> 10:38.805
- Hey, heard you had
a big meeting at Frontier.
How'd it go?

10:38.847 --> 10:41.349
- I get to keep my job. For now.

10:41.391 --> 10:44.477
- That's great.
Listen, Missy--

10:44.519 --> 10:47.647
- I'm trying, Vee.
Best I can do.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.190
- I know.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.776
And you're allowed to feel
however you feel.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.195
Just know that I'm here
if you need me.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.034
(exhaling deeply)

11:00.535 --> 11:02.704
- I told Frontier that I would

11:02.746 --> 11:04.831
double their clickthroughs
in a week.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.833
And I have literally no idea
how I'm going to do that.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.336
- Whoa.
- What?

11:09.377 --> 11:11.713
- They have a lot of followers.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.548
Almost as many as Austin.

11:13.590 --> 11:17.719
You know the easiest thing
would be to post
from Austin's socials,

11:17.761 --> 11:20.013
get all his fans
clicking over.

11:20.055 --> 11:23.058
But I don't think you want to do
the easy thing, do you?

11:24.017 --> 11:25.852
- You know Desiree Lockheart?

11:25.894 --> 11:28.021
- Yeah. She got me through a lot
of long hours on the road.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.440
- Yeah, she's doing
a book signing in town.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.525
Wonder if I can get on her show?

11:32.567 --> 11:33.651
- Hmm!

11:33.693 --> 11:35.862
(chuckles)

11:37.238 --> 11:38.323
- Who's this?

11:42.744 --> 11:45.622
Hey. How did you know
where I lived?

11:45.663 --> 11:47.499
- I didn't.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.377
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.963
- McMurray family, I'd like
to introduce you to Gus Booker.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.632
- Welcome to our home.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.342
- Thanks for having me.

11:57.384 --> 12:01.179
- Missy, your mystery man
is a Booker as in Booker Oil.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.932
- He didn't tell me
he was an oil baron.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.434
- How many wells do you think
Prince Charming's gonna dig?

12:07.268 --> 12:08.311
- It's beautiful.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.772
(tense music)

12:17.278 --> 12:19.823
(serene music)

12:19.864 --> 12:21.157
It's beautiful.

12:21.199 --> 12:24.119
- I told you. It's paradise.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.870
- And big.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.123
You don't realize the scale
of it 'til you're here.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.583
(grass rustling)

12:34.462 --> 12:36.381
- I've done my research,
Mr. Booker.

12:36.423 --> 12:40.135
I understand you want
to get out of the oil business
and get into ranching.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.178
It's not some hobby
you can just pick up.

12:42.220 --> 12:45.598
- That's why I want to partner
with the best ranchers
Colorado has to offer.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.600
(gentle music)

12:50.645 --> 12:52.689
- So, we're gonna be
his employees?

12:52.731 --> 12:54.691
- No, no, no. No.
He'd just be an investor.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.360
- What's the difference?
- Well, look, things...

12:57.402 --> 12:59.029
things wouldn't really
change that much.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.197
- Except he'd be telling us
what to do.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.825
- No. We'd still run the ranch,
we'd own the ranch

13:03.867 --> 13:05.452
but when we do turn a profit,

13:05.493 --> 13:07.537
then as an investor,
he gets a cut.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.748
- And how are we gonna
turn a profit? First thing

13:09.789 --> 13:11.416
he's gonna do it cut costs
and that means us.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.168
- Yeah. What happens
when we can't pay him back?

13:13.209 --> 13:15.587
- Look, guys.
At least it's worth a shot.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.048
It's better than losing
the place to the bank.
- Is it?

13:18.089 --> 13:19.799
- Guys like that,
you give them an inch,

13:19.841 --> 13:21.968
soon enough he's taking an acre.
Every acre we got.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.386
- Well, I wouldn't let
that happen.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.221
- The stories about
his family, what they've done

13:25.263 --> 13:26.890
to other ranchers for oil,
it'd make your head spin.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.767
- Well, he says doing
this apart from his family.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.602
- It doesn't matter.
All rich people are the same.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.937
They think everything's
for sale.

13:32.979 --> 13:36.566
Look, I'm just saying,
you told us to go troubleshoot
and now it's--

13:36.608 --> 13:39.152
- Val, listen, listen.
A few sheep are not gonna

13:39.194 --> 13:41.905
get us out of the red.
We need a long-term plan.
- She's right.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.199
- Guys, I invited him over

13:44.240 --> 13:46.493
for evening rounds and dinner
tomorrow night.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.495
We'll give him
the real ranch experience,

13:48.536 --> 13:50.747
ask him a few questions.

13:50.789 --> 13:53.792
I'd appreciate it if you'd all
be on your best behaviour.

13:55.627 --> 13:56.711
(cows bellowing)

13:56.753 --> 14:00.090
- So, this is Renegade's
replacement, huh?

14:00.131 --> 14:03.301
- When you were in the Marines,
there was more to training

14:03.343 --> 14:05.720
than just learning
how to walk in formation, no?

14:05.762 --> 14:08.598
If you want to be
a pro athlete,

14:08.640 --> 14:10.809
you gotta start acting like one.
That means strength training,

14:10.850 --> 14:13.895
sleeping well, eating well,
drinking less.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.690
- And you're gonna keep tabs
on all this, Missy?

14:16.731 --> 14:18.108
- Yes, I am.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.527
Because I know what it takes.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.530
Cash, if you want to be a champ,
you gotta earn it.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.948
- Mm-hmm.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.616
I keep...

14:26.658 --> 14:30.161
steaks, beers and uh,
yeah, I'll do a swing.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.331
- Steak, yes. Beer, sometimes.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.918
And 14 swings,
each hand, three sets.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.005
- Two sets.
- Is everything gonna be
a negotiation with you?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.632
- I may not be a business man
like Gus Booker but uh...

14:42.674 --> 14:46.469
- Exactly, which is why
you're gonna do, three sets.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.431
Three.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.182
(mellow music)

14:51.224 --> 14:53.143
(coughing)

14:53.184 --> 14:55.353
(grunting)
Geez...

14:57.022 --> 14:59.649
A bit lower.
There we go.

14:59.691 --> 15:04.320
* I've been around the world
wherever the wind blows *

15:04.362 --> 15:08.700
* I've sat beneath the stars
and swam along the coast *

15:08.742 --> 15:13.163
* But it don't compare
to when I'm anywhere you are *

15:13.204 --> 15:16.833
* 'Cause you're the destination
of my highway heart *

15:16.875 --> 15:20.545
* Hey it don't matter
where I go *

15:20.587 --> 15:23.131
* My happy home... **

15:25.008 --> 15:27.302
- So, you uh... dating anyone?

15:27.344 --> 15:30.889
- I thought the sheep were on
the market, not the shepherd.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.640
- Look, I'm just trying
to get caught up

15:32.682 --> 15:34.434
on the last year of your life.

15:34.476 --> 15:37.103
(sighing)
You seem to be texting someone.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.730
(scoffs)

15:38.772 --> 15:41.191
- Not dating...

15:41.232 --> 15:42.901
A date.
- Uh-huh.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.446
- How'd you know these sheep
were for sale anyhow?

15:46.488 --> 15:48.573
- I still got some friends
around here.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.034
- Like, Tucker Clarke?

15:51.076 --> 15:52.744
- Who?
- Pawn shop guy?

15:52.786 --> 15:53.953
Neck tattoo...?

15:53.995 --> 15:56.122
- Yeah, maybe we should check
around back.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.624
- Mm.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.212
(birds chirping)

16:02.253 --> 16:05.382
Saw him at the rodeo,
after Cash's ride?

16:05.423 --> 16:08.760
- Uh, yeah. I've heard of him,
just never met him.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.428
- Really?

16:10.470 --> 16:13.098
Seemed like you two recognized
each other that night.

16:13.139 --> 16:16.142
(distant sheep bleating)

16:16.184 --> 16:19.437
- Oh, hi, Mr. Brigsby.
How are you?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.773
- Valeria Galindo, is that you?

16:21.815 --> 16:24.859
- Yes, Sir. We heard you're
looking to sell your sheep.

16:24.901 --> 16:28.446
- You got a lot of nerve
coming out here.
Get off my land.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.739
- Mr. Brigsby--

16:29.781 --> 16:32.158
- I'm not selling you anything,
now get.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.792
- Shoot.
Guess he still remembers.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.293
- Remembers what?

16:42.335 --> 16:44.671
(Val exhaling deeply)
What'd you do?

16:44.713 --> 16:47.132
- I used to compete against
his daughter in barrel racing.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.259
And by compete, I mean beat.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.636
Every time.
(chuckling)

16:51.678 --> 16:54.055
- Guess we're not getting
those sheep now, are we?

16:55.432 --> 16:57.183
- Why do you look so happy?

16:59.227 --> 17:01.062
- Come on. Tighten your core.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.731
- I got it.
- No, you don't.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.442
- I got-- Okay, what the--
What are we doing here?

17:05.483 --> 17:07.193
You had a national
spokesmodel gig.

17:07.235 --> 17:09.237
- Brand ambassador.
- Now what are--

17:09.279 --> 17:13.700
You putting it all
on the line for what?
What, to help me do a plank?

17:13.742 --> 17:16.286
Come on,
I don't want you wasting your
life on another McMurray.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.288
- That is not your choice
to make.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.789
- No, apparently
it's my mother's.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.958
- For the record,
I'm not wasting my life.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.918
I'm good at this.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.463
I know Austin
cast a long shadow, I get it.

17:26.504 --> 17:28.131
- No, you don't.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.675
Look, we both know
this isn't going to work out.

17:31.343 --> 17:33.261
(subdued music)

17:33.303 --> 17:35.430
- Cash.

17:35.472 --> 17:38.516
Cash, come on.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.441
(upbeat music)

17:51.237 --> 17:53.365
(indistinct chattering)

17:53.406 --> 17:55.450
- Thank you for coming in.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.163
- I didn't think Missy McMurray
waited in line

18:00.205 --> 18:01.581
anywhere in this town.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.001
You gonna sell Desiree jeans?

18:05.043 --> 18:08.088
- I'm giving them to her.
From Frontier.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.298
- Ah. I heard about that.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.343
Your stage mama trained her
pageant queen so well.

18:14.552 --> 18:17.722
But then again,
I guess grief sells.

18:21.476 --> 18:22.977
- I'm not playing that card.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.564
- Why not?
You got to love a great man.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.192
Some women don't even get
half that chance.

18:29.234 --> 18:33.905
He gave you his last name
when he married you,
so isn't it really yours too?

18:34.989 --> 18:36.533
(Desiree): Who's next?

18:36.574 --> 18:38.076
- Desiree, hi.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.786
- Hi.

18:39.828 --> 18:42.372
- I brought you a pair
of Frontier's utility fit.

18:42.414 --> 18:46.459
I know you like to keep a bow
knife on you so you can actually
keep that right in there.

18:46.501 --> 18:49.379
- Ooh. Why, thank you.
Do you want to take a selfie?

18:49.421 --> 18:52.090
- Actually, I'd rather be
on your show.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.217
- As a guest?

18:54.259 --> 18:57.220
And we're gonna talk about
what exactly? Jeans?

18:57.262 --> 19:03.393
- Well, I am a former
Miss Rodeo Rocky Mountain
and a trick rider and um...

19:03.435 --> 19:06.604
- Well, I've had lots of rodeo
queens on the show

19:06.646 --> 19:10.567
and honestly, if Frontier
wants to pay to advertise,

19:10.608 --> 19:13.194
well, they're gonna have
to cough up some money

19:13.236 --> 19:15.321
like the rest of my sponsors,
you know?

19:15.363 --> 19:16.406
(shouting)
Next please!

19:16.448 --> 19:18.908
- Um, I'm also Missy McMurray.

19:18.950 --> 19:22.454
Austin McMurray's wife.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.830
Widow.

19:23.872 --> 19:26.791
- Yes, Missy. I was such a fan
of your husband.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.502
I really wanted
to have him on the show.

19:29.544 --> 19:31.671
I'm very sorry about your loss.

19:31.713 --> 19:34.549
Why don't you stick around
and we will talk.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.384
- Great.
- And meanwhile,

19:36.426 --> 19:38.887
I'll sign this stupid book.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.847
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.891
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.435
(upbeat music)

19:52.650 --> 19:56.446
- See "Austin McMurray's widow"
booked Desiree's show.

19:56.488 --> 19:59.115
(sighing)
- Yes, but nothing
about Missy McMurray.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.117
- I didn't say that.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.869
- No, I did.

20:02.911 --> 20:05.455
Desiree wants me to post
from Austin's account

20:05.497 --> 20:07.374
because that will get
more traffic to Frontier

20:07.415 --> 20:09.459
because apparently, grief sells.

20:09.501 --> 20:12.128
- Well, what do you want to do?

20:12.170 --> 20:15.340
(scoffing)
- I have no...

20:18.343 --> 20:22.013
(somber music)

20:22.055 --> 20:23.598
He proposed to me with this.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.059
Beautiful, huh?

20:26.101 --> 20:29.020
Yeah, proved that he knew me
better than anyone else.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.237
(exhaling deeply)

20:37.278 --> 20:41.074
- Maybe it's time
you make a little room
for your own triumphs.

20:41.116 --> 20:42.617
(scoffs)

20:42.659 --> 20:45.328
- Like what?
"The Hip Hugger Denim" trophy

20:45.370 --> 20:47.622
or the "Low-Rise Vintage" award?

20:47.664 --> 20:50.125
(chuckling)
- Don't knock your swag.

20:50.166 --> 20:54.462
Look, I know it's a big step
but if you want help...

20:56.172 --> 20:59.676
We'd have more fun
than ranch show and tell
with our lurking oil baron.

20:59.718 --> 21:01.344
(scoffs)

21:01.386 --> 21:03.471
- You're right, we would.
(chuckling)

21:05.223 --> 21:07.851
- I'd love some help
with these bags. Here you go.

21:07.892 --> 21:10.520
And listen, I'm gonna need
you guys to season the steaks
for tonight.

21:10.562 --> 21:13.523
- Steak?
Does this guy even eat meat?

21:13.565 --> 21:16.901
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, he's here. Come on.

21:24.826 --> 21:27.203
- Woo. Think he bought those
on his way here?

21:27.245 --> 21:28.872
- Oh, hush!
- Hello.

21:28.913 --> 21:31.541
Are we supposed to be quiet?
- No, no, no, sorry.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.793
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to my sons.

21:33.835 --> 21:37.630
Um... Anyway, Gus,
you remember Cash and Tuff.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.507
- Yeah, good to see you both.
Thanks for having me.

21:39.549 --> 21:41.176
- Hey.
- I brought you something.

21:41.217 --> 21:43.470
- Oh, well, you didn't
have to do that.
- It's nothing.

21:43.511 --> 21:44.804
Just hope you guys
like lemon meringue pie.

21:44.846 --> 21:46.389
- Who doesn't?

21:46.431 --> 21:47.640
- Cash, you recognize
this region?

21:47.682 --> 21:49.768
- Yeah, I sure do.
- Great year.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.478
- Guys, why don't you
bring this inside?

21:51.519 --> 21:54.189
And let Missy and Valeria know
that Gus is here.

21:57.108 --> 21:58.818
Well, uh,

21:58.860 --> 22:00.737
you know, I thought
we'd do evening rounds

22:00.779 --> 22:03.406
and give you a taste of
what the ranch is really like.

22:03.448 --> 22:06.034
- Yeah, excellent.
Just tell me how I can help.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.577
- Yeah.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.080
(mellow music)

22:10.121 --> 22:12.999
We got three orphaned calves who
need to be fed milk replacer.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.710
- What happened to their mother?
- Well, there was, uh,

22:15.752 --> 22:17.671
two sets of twins,
which is unusual,

22:17.712 --> 22:19.714
so the mother can only feed one.

22:19.756 --> 22:22.550
- So, they were rejected?
That's sad.

22:22.592 --> 22:25.178
- Not really. It's nature.
Nature is cruel.

22:25.220 --> 22:27.305
- But we don't have to be.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.724
- Val, why don't you go
check on dinner?

22:32.227 --> 22:35.522
And I will get some lids
so we can start the feeding.

22:35.563 --> 22:38.108
- This is great.
- Okay.

22:38.149 --> 22:39.693
(chuckling)
- Thanks.

22:39.734 --> 22:42.779
- Come here, okay.
Come on, here you go.

22:42.821 --> 22:46.533
Here you go, all right,
right here. Ah, good, yeah.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.952
There you are. Okay.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.621
Gus, you want to give it a try?
- I'd love to.

22:51.663 --> 22:53.665
- Come on, step in.
Here you are.

22:53.707 --> 22:55.458
- Just like this?
- Yep.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.378
- Okay.
Wow, this little guy is strong.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.879
(chuckling)
- Yeah.

22:59.921 --> 23:01.965
- You all have something
really special here.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.760
I want to be a part of it.
If you'll let me.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.722
(calf bleating)

23:08.763 --> 23:11.141
- Oh. Somebody calling my name.

23:14.519 --> 23:18.481
- Shouldn't you be playing
your cards just a little closer
to your vest?

23:18.523 --> 23:20.734
- I could.
But I don't like games.

23:20.775 --> 23:23.653
Speaking of,
I have to confess something.

23:23.695 --> 23:26.823
Yesterday when I said
seeing you was a surprise,

23:26.865 --> 23:28.366
I wasn't being
completely honest.

23:28.408 --> 23:30.660
I knew it was
the McMurray Ranch.

23:30.702 --> 23:32.454
I was actually hoping
I'd run into you.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.497
- How's it going out here?

23:34.539 --> 23:38.251
- Um, I'm learning
a whole new skill set.

23:38.293 --> 23:40.211
- Oh, yeah. I'm sure you are.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.005
(scoffs)
- Here, trade you.

23:42.047 --> 23:43.715
- Hold on.

23:43.757 --> 23:46.217
- Why don't you go and take this
and put it in the fridge?

23:47.260 --> 23:48.720
Mm-hmm?
- Okay.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.349
- That guy's gonna run a ranch?

23:52.390 --> 23:54.601
(chuckling)
- Come on.

23:54.642 --> 23:57.854
Is this really about the ranch
or is this about Missy?

23:57.896 --> 24:00.523
- The guy swoops into town,
offers to save the day,

24:00.565 --> 24:03.234
no strings attached while wooing
the resident widow.

24:03.276 --> 24:05.904
I'm not buying it.
Neither are you.

24:11.201 --> 24:13.828
- Gus, this pie looks delicious.

24:13.870 --> 24:15.663
- Just trying to turn lemonade
into lemons

24:15.705 --> 24:17.540
or lemon pie into lemons.

24:17.582 --> 24:19.459
(chuckles nervously)

24:19.501 --> 24:21.753
Uh, so, Missy, I hear
you're going to be
on Lokckheart's radio show.

24:21.795 --> 24:24.130
- Oh, you are?
Well, be careful,

24:24.172 --> 24:27.676
that Desiree is a whiz
at getting her guests
to reveal their secrets.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.969
Um. Oh, you know what?
I'll grab a knife for the pie.

24:30.011 --> 24:32.931
- Here you go.
- Ooh. What secrets, Missy?

24:32.972 --> 24:35.141
- Missy and Austin
didn't have any secrets.

24:35.183 --> 24:36.643
- How would you know?

24:36.685 --> 24:38.478
- You can talk about
your trick riding.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.188
My niece and I are both
fans of Missy's.

24:40.230 --> 24:45.068
- Oh, did you become fans before
or after you decided to invest?

24:45.110 --> 24:46.611
- Why does that matter?

24:46.653 --> 24:48.363
- Ah, it's just sort
of an odd timeline.

24:48.405 --> 24:49.823
- Or a happy coincidence.

24:49.864 --> 24:52.575
- I could talk
about my coaching.

24:52.617 --> 24:55.620
I'm supposed to be
Cash's bull riding coach.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.580
- Supposed to be?

24:57.622 --> 24:59.124
- Well, you know anything
about bull riding, Gus?

24:59.165 --> 25:01.334
- Uh, I went to the running
of the bulls.

25:01.376 --> 25:02.752
- In Spain?
- Yes.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.879
- 'Cause that's the same thing.

25:04.921 --> 25:08.341
- 'Course not but it sure
gave me an appreciation
for their speed and strength.

25:08.383 --> 25:11.094
- Speaking of, how many bulls
do you put in with 100 cattle
for breeding?

25:11.136 --> 25:14.139
- Valeria.
- No, it's fine. I know this.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.890
Four, for 100 cows.

25:15.932 --> 25:17.684
- Hmm.
- Lucky bulls.

25:17.726 --> 25:20.437
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

25:20.478 --> 25:22.439
- And what time of year
do we brand?

25:22.480 --> 25:24.983
- What is this,
twenty questions? He already
said he has a lot to learn.

25:25.025 --> 25:27.277
- Well, he's gotta know
what he's getting into.

25:27.318 --> 25:30.405
He can't just swoop in
and make a bunch of changes.
- Oh, really? Says who?

25:30.447 --> 25:34.701
- When spring turns to summer.
That's when you brand
your cattle.

25:34.743 --> 25:36.453
- Yes, bravo.

25:36.494 --> 25:38.496
- Yes, I realize
I am new to this.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.665
That's why I need
all of you.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.376
- Eh, the money man keeps
all control, right?

25:43.418 --> 25:45.920
(scoffs)
- What Cash is trying to say

25:45.962 --> 25:48.465
is that this place
is really special to us

25:48.506 --> 25:51.801
and we just want to make sure
that we're all on the same page.

25:51.843 --> 25:54.637
- I get it. This ranch
is your family legacy.

25:54.679 --> 25:56.639
(chuckling)

25:56.681 --> 25:59.768
- It's just funny that
you mention family legacy.
Can we ask about yours?

25:59.809 --> 26:03.063
- Why? He already said
he's doing this independently,
like I said before.

26:03.104 --> 26:06.066
- Believe me, I know
the reputation my family has.

26:06.107 --> 26:08.401
I dislike it as much as you do.

26:08.443 --> 26:11.279
That's why striking out
on my own is so important to me.

26:11.321 --> 26:14.991
- Oh, so it's just a pet project
to prove to Daddy

26:15.033 --> 26:16.659
you got gumption?
- Cash!

26:16.701 --> 26:18.370
- Well, no, so what happens
when you want

26:18.411 --> 26:20.205
to join the billionaires
space race

26:20.246 --> 26:22.207
and turn this place into your
own personal launching pad?

26:22.248 --> 26:25.085
What then, Gus? You gonna
kick us all to the curb?

26:25.126 --> 26:28.213
- All I got is my word.
And I stand by it.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.757
But I won't stay
where I'm not welcome.

26:30.799 --> 26:33.760
So, thank you for dinner,
Mrs. McMurray, Missy.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.720
- What?
- No, no, Gus.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.098
- Wait a sec, I...

26:38.723 --> 26:40.517
(tense music)

26:40.558 --> 26:42.352
- Bye.
(giggling)

26:43.478 --> 26:45.313
- I hope you're all happy.

26:45.355 --> 26:47.065
We may have to say goodbye
to this ranch

26:47.107 --> 26:49.984
because you just cost us
our lifeline.

26:51.528 --> 26:53.321
(exhaling deeply)

26:59.077 --> 27:01.705
(serene music)

27:03.581 --> 27:08.211
- So, uh, this radio interview
I have today,
how do you feel about it?

27:08.253 --> 27:10.422
- Better than I do
about dinner last night.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.132
- Yeah, I think we were all

27:12.173 --> 27:14.634
a little on edge last night.
I know I was.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.886
Not just about Gus.

27:18.263 --> 27:19.973
- I'll be listening.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.686
- They're gonna want me
to talk about Austin.

27:24.728 --> 27:27.897
- He was your husband,
you can honour his memory.

27:29.024 --> 27:30.817
- I know, it's just--
- Shh.

27:30.859 --> 27:33.278
- We're all still grieving

27:33.319 --> 27:35.739
and I'm the one who gets
to talk about it. I just...

27:35.780 --> 27:37.866
(horse neighing)

27:37.907 --> 27:43.246
I don't want you to think
that I'm exploiting him
to sell jeans.

27:43.288 --> 27:47.417
- You know how many Frontier
jean patches I sewed
on his riding vest?

27:48.752 --> 27:52.213
- So does that mean
you're okay with it?

27:52.255 --> 27:56.676
- Austin was my son.
And I miss him terribly.

27:56.718 --> 27:59.637
But the important thing
is that you tell your story.

27:59.679 --> 28:03.850
And don't let anyone tell you
how to do that. You hear me?

28:03.892 --> 28:05.769
- Yeah.

28:08.897 --> 28:11.900
- I knew you would be packing up
again in no time.

28:11.941 --> 28:14.110
- I'm not.

28:14.152 --> 28:17.947
Brigsby thinks his daughter
lost against me because my horse
is better than hers.

28:17.989 --> 28:20.116
He's right.

28:20.158 --> 28:22.327
She is.

28:22.369 --> 28:25.121
So, I'm selling her to him.
- Chantico?

28:25.163 --> 28:26.581
- I promised those sheep
to Isabel

28:26.623 --> 28:28.541
and I'm not gonna break another
promise to that woman.

28:28.583 --> 28:30.168
- I'm not letting you
sell your horse.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.170
There's got to be
another way.

28:32.212 --> 28:33.630
- Like?

28:36.007 --> 28:38.301
(cell phone chiming)

28:41.805 --> 28:43.723
- Mr. Wooten. Hi.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.476
- My marketing department
just informed me you're going
to be a guest

28:46.518 --> 28:49.270
on Desiree's radio program
this afternoon.

28:49.312 --> 28:50.939
You didn't get approval
for that.

28:50.980 --> 28:55.860
- Oh, I didn't realize that
I had to. It's free advertising.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.029
- Well, that doesn't matter.

28:58.071 --> 28:59.489
You're repping our brand now.

28:59.531 --> 29:01.991
We need to be involved,
we need to draft talking points.

29:02.033 --> 29:05.745
You know, an interview with
that kind of reach goes south,
you could hurt Frontier.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.580
You could hurt
everything we stand for.

29:07.622 --> 29:09.958
- But I have lots of interview
experience.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.085
- That doesn't matter, Missy.

29:12.127 --> 29:14.629
Now listen, I need you
to cancel.

29:14.671 --> 29:15.672
Now.

29:15.714 --> 29:17.507
(phone beeping)

29:17.549 --> 29:19.009
(scoffs)

29:25.181 --> 29:27.809
(tense music)

29:34.816 --> 29:37.694
- Hello and welcome to, "These
Boots Were Made for Talking."

29:37.736 --> 29:39.529
I'm your host,
Desiree Lockheart.

29:39.571 --> 29:42.699
I am sitting with none other
than Missy McMurray.

29:42.741 --> 29:46.411
The woman behind one
of the greatest bull riders

29:46.453 --> 29:48.329
of our generation.

29:48.371 --> 29:51.166
The late great, Austin McMurray.

29:51.207 --> 29:53.209
Missy, welcome to the show.

29:53.251 --> 29:55.503
- Thank you,
I'm happy to be here.

29:55.545 --> 30:00.091
- I think your story of bravery
and resilience

30:00.133 --> 30:03.720
is gonna be really inspiring
for a lot of women out there.

30:03.762 --> 30:05.764
- That's my hope.

30:05.805 --> 30:08.224
- Let's get right
to the good stuff.

30:08.266 --> 30:10.393
What was it like being married

30:10.435 --> 30:12.604
to one of the greatest
bull riders ever?

30:12.645 --> 30:14.731
- It was intoxicating.

30:14.773 --> 30:17.734
You know, the fans, the travel

30:17.776 --> 30:21.196
and Austin, he really loved
what he did.

30:21.237 --> 30:24.866
You know, I'm just now trying
to figure out what it means
to move on without him.

30:24.908 --> 30:28.370
I actually just
became a brand ambassador
for Frontier Jeans.

30:28.411 --> 30:29.871
- Well, Missy. That's so great.

30:29.913 --> 30:32.791
Yeah, but you know what?
I want to go back in time.

30:32.832 --> 30:36.461
Way back in time to the height
of Austin's career.

30:36.503 --> 30:40.799
The awards, the travel
and you were right by his side.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.885
- You know, I was no stranger
to rodeo either.

30:43.927 --> 30:46.471
I used to be a rodeo queen
and a trick rider before that.

30:46.513 --> 30:48.181
- Uh-huh. Well, you know what?

30:48.223 --> 30:52.394
We have got a lot of Austin fans
waiting to talk to you, Missy.

30:52.435 --> 30:54.521
So, why don't we take
some calls, you up for that?

30:54.562 --> 30:56.231
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.732
(clicking)
Okay, Missy, I'm gonna really

30:57.774 --> 31:02.320
need you to kinda give us
a sneak peek into Austin's life.

31:02.362 --> 31:03.988
Are you with me on that?
- Mm-hmm.

31:04.030 --> 31:06.449
- Okay. All right, we've got
Cynthia from Shade Falls,

31:06.491 --> 31:09.244
Yelena from Tucson

31:09.285 --> 31:12.372
and Chad from Canyon.

31:12.414 --> 31:14.499
Cynthia, you're on. Let's go.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.543
(Cynthia on phone): Hi, Missy.
Big fan of Austin's.

31:16.584 --> 31:18.294
I'd just like to know
what he was like at home.

31:18.336 --> 31:19.921
Was he sweet? Funny?

31:19.963 --> 31:24.509
- Austin, he could make me laugh
more than anybody.

31:24.551 --> 31:25.927
(Cynthia): Really?

31:25.969 --> 31:27.804
- I remember one time
I challenged him to a race

31:27.846 --> 31:29.931
and when he lost,

31:29.973 --> 31:32.851
he had to wear his brother's
old rodeo clown outfit
for a week.

31:32.892 --> 31:35.353
He even wore it
to some fancy dinner.

31:35.395 --> 31:36.438
(chuckling)

31:36.479 --> 31:37.731
(clicking)

31:37.772 --> 31:40.400
Hey, um, did you say
Chad from Canyon?

31:40.442 --> 31:42.027
Could we go to him next?

31:42.068 --> 31:44.029
- Oh, yeah.

31:44.070 --> 31:46.781
Okay, Chad, from Canyon.
You're on with Missy.

31:46.823 --> 31:48.491
(Chad on phone): Oh, hi, Missy.

31:48.533 --> 31:51.119
This is Chad Radcliffe,
from the Daily Rider.

31:51.161 --> 31:52.620
Our readers would love to know,

31:52.662 --> 31:55.623
where do you see yourself
in five years?

31:56.833 --> 32:00.211
- See myself in five years?

32:00.253 --> 32:01.546
I don't know.

32:01.588 --> 32:05.216
When I lost my husband,
I lost myself.

32:05.258 --> 32:09.554
And then all of a sudden I just
became Austin McMurray's widow.

32:09.596 --> 32:12.182
And I forgot that
I'm a rider too.

32:12.223 --> 32:16.353
I can do a suicide drag
off of a horse
at breakneck speed

32:16.394 --> 32:19.105
and I've got
my own story to tell.

32:19.147 --> 32:21.733
- And what do you hope
to accomplish
by telling that story?

32:21.775 --> 32:24.569
- I just hope that...

32:24.611 --> 32:28.573
I can remind people that
it's okay to be lost sometimes.

32:28.615 --> 32:32.285
To not know where you want
to be in five years,

32:32.327 --> 32:34.204
let alone next week.

32:34.245 --> 32:37.123
And if I've done that,
then I think I've done my job.

32:38.583 --> 32:41.670
And I would really like
to thank Frontier Jeans

32:41.711 --> 32:45.048
for giving me the opportunity
to put myself out there again.

32:45.090 --> 32:46.675
And to remind myself

32:46.716 --> 32:49.427
that I'm just
as resilient as their jeans.

32:49.469 --> 32:53.264
- And you are good, Missy.
Frontier Jeans got one more plug
in for them.

32:53.306 --> 32:57.060
Good for you. That's our show.
Thank you for joining us today.

32:57.102 --> 32:58.436
- Thank you.

32:58.478 --> 33:00.146
- See you next time.
Desiree signing off.

33:01.690 --> 33:04.067
(cell phone chiming)

33:04.109 --> 33:05.568
- Hello?

33:05.610 --> 33:07.862
- Well, that was beyond
unprofessional.

33:07.904 --> 33:11.533
And I should fire you
on the spot. But...

33:11.574 --> 33:13.910
I just got off the phone
with our head of marketing.

33:13.952 --> 33:17.038
During that interview,
traffic to our website spiked.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.915
By more than double.

33:18.957 --> 33:21.251
(exhaling)
- That is great news.

33:21.292 --> 33:24.421
So, does that mean I can
represent Frontier Jeans
from Canyon?

33:24.462 --> 33:26.631
- Hmm, you're still gonna have

33:26.673 --> 33:28.675
to prove to me you're more
than just a one-trick pony.

33:29.592 --> 33:31.302
- Challenge accepted.

33:31.344 --> 33:33.930
(sheep bleating)

33:38.768 --> 33:40.895
- What did I tell you?

33:40.937 --> 33:43.064
- Mr. Brigsby,
we're here about those sheep.

33:43.106 --> 33:45.900
- Yeah, I figured as much
and I'm not selling
to the likes of you.

33:45.942 --> 33:48.236
Going back on your offer
to my daughter.

33:48.278 --> 33:50.947
- Well, then who you selling to,
huh? 'Cause I don't see
a line out your door.

33:50.989 --> 33:53.283
- Word around town is you've
over-grazed your pastures

33:53.324 --> 33:55.326
and that's why you're looking
to get rid of your flock.

33:55.368 --> 33:57.370
- See, here's what
we're offering.

33:57.412 --> 33:59.998
We take your sheep to our ranch,
there's lots of pasture
for them to graze on--

34:00.040 --> 34:02.208
- And you pay us a small fee
to keep them fed and watered.

34:02.250 --> 34:05.337
- You just want me to give them
over and pay you for it?

34:05.378 --> 34:07.505
That don't sound like a deal.

34:07.547 --> 34:09.007
- Come shearing time,
we'll do all the work.

34:09.049 --> 34:11.634
And we'll split the earnings,
50-50.

34:13.970 --> 34:16.806
- All right then, best of luck
with your feed bill.

34:16.848 --> 34:19.476
It could take years
for that pasture to grow back.

34:19.517 --> 34:21.269
- If it ever does.
- Fine!

34:22.854 --> 34:25.148
Y'all got yourself a deal.

34:28.651 --> 34:30.987
(mellow music)

34:36.493 --> 34:38.495
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:38.536 --> 34:40.121
(horse neighing)

34:40.163 --> 34:41.456
- Hello.

34:41.498 --> 34:43.583
- Heard you on that radio show.

34:43.625 --> 34:45.460
That Chad sure sounded nice.

34:45.502 --> 34:48.254
- Friendly caller.
- Mm.

34:48.296 --> 34:50.465
Missy. I'm proud of you.

34:50.507 --> 34:52.133
- Well, this ranch is my home.

34:52.175 --> 34:54.552
And I want to do everything
I can to fight for it.

34:54.594 --> 34:57.055
- Can't keep it afloat
on a shoestring forever.

34:57.097 --> 34:59.224
- It's not going to be forever.

34:59.265 --> 35:02.060
And Cash will land
that sponsorship, eventually.

35:02.102 --> 35:03.770
(scoffs)

35:03.812 --> 35:05.855
But you don't want that, do you?

35:05.897 --> 35:08.274
- I don't have to rely
on that sponsorship.

35:08.316 --> 35:11.778
- Is that why you've been
keeping him
from getting a new bull?

35:14.155 --> 35:15.740
- Truth is,

35:15.782 --> 35:17.909
no mother wants her son
riding bulls.

35:17.951 --> 35:19.661
- I know.

35:19.703 --> 35:21.246
Which is why I'm gonna do
everything I can

35:21.287 --> 35:22.372
to make sure he stays safe.

35:30.046 --> 35:32.507
- Why do I feel like
I'm at the principal's office?

35:32.549 --> 35:34.426
- 'Cause you are.

35:34.467 --> 35:37.595
- Val. Great job getting
those sheep. We need a lot more
of those ideas.

35:37.637 --> 35:41.016
- Thanks. But I couldn't have
done it without Tuff.

35:41.057 --> 35:42.600
- You guys make a great team.

35:42.642 --> 35:47.272
Which is why I have decided
to make you co-foremen.

35:47.313 --> 35:50.400
- What?
- That's not even a real thing.

35:50.442 --> 35:52.318
- Yes, it is, if I say it is.

35:53.028 --> 35:54.529
So, want the job or not?

35:54.571 --> 35:56.031
- Yes.

35:56.072 --> 35:58.575
- Good, great, well then.
It's settled.

36:03.246 --> 36:06.499
Tuff. One more thing.

36:06.541 --> 36:08.835
Listen, now that you're sharing
the work with Val,

36:08.877 --> 36:11.087
I need you to focus
on keeping your brother safe.

36:11.129 --> 36:13.506
As his bull fighter.

36:13.548 --> 36:16.092
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm counting on you.

36:17.844 --> 36:18.720
- Okay.

36:20.805 --> 36:21.890
(upbeat music)

36:21.931 --> 36:24.392
Demoted, by my own mother.

36:24.434 --> 36:27.187
Co-foreman, it's not even
a real thing.

36:27.228 --> 36:29.522
- One good thing about
a demotion,

36:29.564 --> 36:31.483
you'll have more free time now,
no?

36:31.524 --> 36:35.403
- So, I can go out on a date
once in a while?

36:35.445 --> 36:37.947
- I hope it's more
than once in a while.

36:37.989 --> 36:40.033
What about your music?

36:40.075 --> 36:42.369
- Mm. What about it?

36:42.410 --> 36:44.120
- When I saw you playing
the other day,

36:44.162 --> 36:46.373
you had this look in your eyes.

36:46.414 --> 36:50.168
- Me and every other
country star wannabe.

36:50.210 --> 36:52.253
It's just a hobby.

36:52.295 --> 36:54.005
(indistinct chattering)

36:54.047 --> 36:56.174
- Let me ask you.

36:56.216 --> 36:59.511
How can someone who throws
himself in front of bulls
be scared of chasing his dreams?

36:59.552 --> 37:03.556
- I haven't been bull fighting
in a year, so...

37:03.598 --> 37:06.226
- But your mother
wants you to now?

37:06.267 --> 37:07.227
- For my brother.

37:07.268 --> 37:10.397
- So, this isn't a demotion,

37:10.438 --> 37:14.651
it's more of a... reinstatement?

37:18.697 --> 37:21.282
(serene music)

37:31.543 --> 37:33.336
(knocking)

37:33.378 --> 37:35.422
- Hey.

37:36.548 --> 37:37.841
- Uh...

37:40.176 --> 37:43.513
Uh, a stock contractor guy
just called me back.

37:43.555 --> 37:46.975
Turns out that bull
is headed this way.

37:47.017 --> 37:50.103
- Well, that is great news.

37:50.145 --> 37:52.105
- How'd you do it?

37:52.147 --> 37:53.982
- Do what?

37:54.024 --> 37:55.984
- When my mom's
made up her mind,

37:56.026 --> 37:58.570
it is really hard
to get her to change it.

37:58.611 --> 38:01.322
- I just did what
any good coach would do.

38:01.364 --> 38:04.993
What's best for the rider.
Chad, from Canyon.

38:05.035 --> 38:06.453
(chuckling)

38:07.495 --> 38:10.540
- I'm willing to
give this thing a try.

38:10.582 --> 38:12.625
If you are.

38:12.667 --> 38:16.004
(tender music)

38:16.046 --> 38:17.088
- What would Austin think?

38:17.130 --> 38:19.632
- I think he'd be okay.

38:19.674 --> 38:21.301
As long as there were
some ground rules.

38:21.343 --> 38:23.595
Uh, Coach, athlete
kind of thing.

38:23.636 --> 38:25.263
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

38:25.305 --> 38:27.849
- Well, we'll really have
to work on the athlete thing
but uh...

38:27.891 --> 38:29.142
- Yeah.
- All right.

38:29.184 --> 38:30.727
Let's make you a champion.

38:32.103 --> 38:34.981
- I'm ready as ever... Coach.

38:36.608 --> 38:38.735
(cell phone chiming)
- Oh...

38:39.903 --> 38:42.989
Uh, ah... Excuse me.

38:43.031 --> 38:44.574
I gotta go.

38:57.545 --> 39:00.757
- What about them dancin' horse
from Spain?

39:00.799 --> 39:02.717
- Andalusians.

39:02.759 --> 39:05.178
- Isn't that a dream of yours?
- Yeah.

39:05.220 --> 39:07.305
(Isabel shouting):
Guys, Austin's back!

39:07.347 --> 39:10.100
- Hey, y'all! Woo!

39:10.141 --> 39:11.559
Hey, Mama!

39:11.601 --> 39:14.479
- You were about to tell me
something...

39:17.399 --> 39:19.567
- So what have you been up
to all these months, huh?

39:19.609 --> 39:21.986
Just hanging out
and cow-tipping?
(chuckling)

39:22.028 --> 39:24.531
- No, I have not been
cow-tipping.

39:24.572 --> 39:26.991
We have not been cow-tipping.

39:27.033 --> 39:28.368
- We?

39:28.410 --> 39:30.912
- Yeah, Missy and me. Um...

39:34.124 --> 39:36.501
- I'm gonna ask her
to marry me, Cash.

39:37.377 --> 39:39.546
- Wait, what?!

39:39.587 --> 39:42.007
Y'all barely been in the same
town since you got together.

39:42.048 --> 39:45.051
I didn't think
you were serious about her.
- I wasn't.

39:45.093 --> 39:48.346
All those lonely nights
on the road gave me
a lot of time to think.

39:49.139 --> 39:50.849
I love her.

39:50.890 --> 39:52.892
I want her with me.

39:52.934 --> 39:55.353
(tense music)

39:55.395 --> 39:59.065
- Um, she can't be a rodeo queen
if she's married, Austin.

39:59.107 --> 40:01.609
Uh, it...

40:01.651 --> 40:04.029
I mean you sure
she's ready for that?

40:04.070 --> 40:06.531
- She can always so no,
can't she?

40:06.573 --> 40:08.950
But I think this
is what she wants.

40:08.992 --> 40:10.118
It's what I want.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.662
(chuckling)

40:12.704 --> 40:14.956
(subdued music)

40:19.669 --> 40:21.421
Where you going?

40:23.923 --> 40:25.592
(clears throat)

40:32.891 --> 40:34.726
(scoffing)

40:50.241 --> 40:52.327
- You gotta use this.

40:52.369 --> 40:55.121
It has these dancing horses
that she really likes.

40:56.247 --> 40:58.041
Trust me.

40:58.083 --> 40:59.834
- Dancing horses.

41:01.169 --> 41:03.421
(subdued music)

41:04.547 --> 41:08.635
(horse neighing, trotting)

41:10.970 --> 41:13.723
- Heard you on Desiree's radio
show. You were great.

41:13.765 --> 41:17.477
- Did you come all the way
out here just to tell me that?

41:17.519 --> 41:19.854
- I still had a lot
of questions.

41:19.896 --> 41:21.523
(chuckles)

41:21.564 --> 41:23.858
Any chance I could ask you
a few over coffee?

41:23.900 --> 41:25.985
- Um...

41:26.027 --> 41:28.822
Maybe some other time?

41:28.863 --> 41:30.782
- Understood.

41:31.908 --> 41:34.035
Well, still in the game.

41:35.078 --> 41:35.912
- For the ranch?

41:37.080 --> 41:39.124
- But I can't wait around
forever.

41:39.165 --> 41:41.584
They're lots of other ranches,

41:41.626 --> 41:44.421
even if this is the one
I really want.

41:44.462 --> 41:46.506
(inhaling deeply)

41:47.799 --> 41:49.718
(chuckling)

41:49.759 --> 41:51.636
- So, when are you gonna
take me to the ranch?

41:51.678 --> 41:53.221
- I think we said, day four?

41:53.263 --> 41:55.890
(door bells chiming)

41:57.142 --> 41:59.144
- Ah, really holding me out.

41:59.185 --> 42:00.770
- Once second.

42:00.812 --> 42:01.980
Val!

42:02.022 --> 42:04.566
(upbeat music)

42:04.607 --> 42:07.193
(door bells chiming)

42:07.235 --> 42:09.946
(indistinct chattering)

42:32.469 --> 42:36.264
(music intensifies)

42:36.306 --> 42:39.059
Subtitling: difuze
