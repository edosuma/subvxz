00:00.001 --> 00:02.201
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on when calls the heart...</i>

00:02.203 --> 00:03.535
Are you accusing me of arson,
constable?

00:03.537 --> 00:05.037
Why haven't you
arrested her yet?

00:05.039 --> 00:06.905
There is damaging evidence
against her.

00:06.907 --> 00:07.806
No!

00:07.808 --> 00:09.074
You can't do this!

00:09.076 --> 00:10.509
She's an innocent woman,
you had no right!

00:10.511 --> 00:11.477
Enough!

00:11.479 --> 00:12.711
[screams]

00:18.084 --> 00:22.221
[♪]

01:04.964 --> 01:09.835
"hope is the thing
with feathers..."

01:11.371 --> 01:13.505
Just 10 of emily dickinson's
poems were published

01:13.507 --> 01:14.940
While she was alive,

01:14.942 --> 01:17.109
But her words
have moved millions.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.877
[heavy footsteps outside]

01:27.053 --> 01:28.921
Sorry, ma'am,

01:28.923 --> 01:30.923
We thought this was a saloon.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.357
It is, at night.

01:32.359 --> 01:34.059
During the day,
it's the school.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.894
Is this where
we're supposed to stay?

01:35.896 --> 01:37.396
Welcome,
gentlemen!

01:37.398 --> 01:40.432
You'll be housed
in the rooms upstairs.

01:41.634 --> 01:44.570
We've spent six days
crossing this cursed country.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.872
We came a long way
to work in this mine.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.507
Least we can get
is a drink.

01:48.509 --> 01:49.808
Are there any kids coming?

01:49.810 --> 01:51.110
Nope, no children.

01:51.112 --> 01:53.512
Company's just hiring
single men.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.247
Welcome,

01:55.249 --> 01:56.315
But we're right in the middle
of our school day,

01:56.317 --> 01:57.549
So we've got to get back
to our lesson.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.952
Sorry for
the intrusion, ma'am.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.687
Bar's right there, fellas.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.556
I'm gonna
get myself a drink.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.492
The lady's trying
to teach a lesson.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.260
We'll go to our rooms.

02:08.262 --> 02:11.930
After I get
my drink.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.132
Mister!

02:13.134 --> 02:14.500
Is that really
the first impression

02:14.502 --> 02:17.169
You want to make
in coal valley?

02:17.171 --> 02:19.338
The constable's right.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.573
How about
I buy a round later?

02:21.575 --> 02:23.475
[miners murmuring in delight]

02:23.477 --> 02:26.345
Well, I guess
I can wait,

02:26.347 --> 02:29.882
Since it's gonna be free.

02:33.186 --> 02:35.754
"hope is the thing
with feathers

02:35.756 --> 02:37.189
That perches
in the soul..."

02:38.525 --> 02:42.928
"and sings the tune
without the words

02:42.930 --> 02:44.863
And never stops at all..."

02:44.865 --> 02:46.965
How does it end?

02:49.235 --> 02:50.869
No matter.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.405
It'll come to me.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.174
Good day, professor.

02:57.043 --> 02:59.178
Thank you.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.484
Ma'am.

03:09.322 --> 03:13.392
[♪]

03:24.270 --> 03:26.772
You sure you want
to unravel that?

03:26.774 --> 03:28.640
Wasn't that your husband's
favorite sweater?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.108
Oh, he would have
approved.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.410
This way,
a little part of him

03:31.412 --> 03:33.512
Can help keep
your baby warm.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.813
Thank you.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.115
The blanket's
gonna be handy.

03:37.117 --> 03:40.352
It'll be cold by the time
I deliver in a few months.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.621
[groans]

03:42.623 --> 03:45.290
Carla, you're bigger
than seven months.

03:45.292 --> 03:47.626
Probably more like eight months.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.062
Well, maybe
I counted wrong,

03:50.064 --> 03:52.231
But I guess we'll find out.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.533
I feel like I've been pregnant
a whole year.

03:56.302 --> 03:58.470
Oh, this is so pretty.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.339
Violets are my favorite.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.873
You know, my joe
never noticed flowers.

04:01.875 --> 04:02.774
I could go out,
pick a bouquet,

04:02.776 --> 04:04.243
Put them on the table,

04:04.245 --> 04:05.677
And he'd say,
"what's for supper?"

04:05.679 --> 04:07.579
[they all laugh]

04:07.581 --> 04:10.115
Men. Lord,
they're impossible.

04:10.117 --> 04:13.218
Until they're gone.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.256
Did you hear?

04:17.258 --> 04:18.757
All those new miners
who came to town

04:18.759 --> 04:19.725
Are bachelors.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.293
I saw them.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.161
They're staying in the rooms
above the saloon.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.663
How did they look?

04:24.665 --> 04:26.531
Wet and dirty.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.500
They're probably all
drifters and troublemakers.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.534
I'm not sure I like
that kind of element

04:29.536 --> 04:31.270
Coming into coal valley.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.338
Well, let's not be
too quick to judge.

04:33.340 --> 04:34.840
My husband wasn't
a chivalrous man,

04:34.842 --> 04:37.209
But he provided just fine
for caleb and me.

04:37.211 --> 04:38.644
You're right,
mary.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.879
We all know how hard it is
to find a good man.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.381
Or a good father
for our children.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.448
[groans in pain]

04:43.450 --> 04:44.816
Oh, carla,

04:44.818 --> 04:48.220
I think it's time
that we get you home,

04:48.222 --> 04:50.555
Get you into bed
so you can get some rest.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.190
Ooh... There we go.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.126
[gasping with effort]

05:03.169 --> 05:05.270
Hi, jack.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.872
Hi.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.174
How's plans for the dance coming
along?

05:09.176 --> 05:10.709
Very well, thank you.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.878
I'm looking forward to
something in that saloon

05:12.880 --> 05:14.880
Besides 40 miners
sawing logs all night long.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.381
[laughs]

05:17.517 --> 05:19.651
I'm just picking up
some more supplies.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.354
My students are making
all the decorations

05:22.356 --> 05:24.189
And we're running out
of colored paper.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.791
Nice.

05:27.760 --> 05:31.196
So, are you
going to the dance?

05:31.198 --> 05:32.297
Yes,

05:32.299 --> 05:35.267
But in an official
capacity.

05:35.269 --> 05:38.370
Does that mean
you're going alone?

05:38.372 --> 05:39.738
I'll be on duty.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.140
Oh, I see.

05:42.142 --> 05:46.178
You're not allowed
to have any fun?

05:46.180 --> 05:47.479
What's going to happen

05:47.481 --> 05:49.448
When you settle down
and have a family?

05:49.450 --> 05:51.483
Well, that's
unlikely to happen.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.784
Mounties and marriage,

05:52.786 --> 05:54.519
Two subjects
that don't go together.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.888
At the academy,
they told us,

05:56.890 --> 05:58.256
"if the mounties wanted you
to have a wife,

05:58.258 --> 05:59.758
We would have issued you one."

06:01.361 --> 06:04.696
So you don't ever
want to get married?

06:04.698 --> 06:07.399
I didn't say that.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.334
It's just that the mountie life

06:09.336 --> 06:11.403
Can put a wife
through a lot of hardship.

06:11.405 --> 06:14.639
For instance, living in a tent
six months at a time

06:14.641 --> 06:16.308
Without a privy.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.411
So, theoretically,

06:19.413 --> 06:21.747
Mounties don't marry

06:21.749 --> 06:24.383
Because they think women
are delicate?

06:25.451 --> 06:26.852
[chuckles]

06:26.854 --> 06:29.755
I've just remembered
I've got some work to do.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.823
Mm-hmm.

06:31.825 --> 06:32.924
So...

06:32.926 --> 06:35.260
I'm going to see to it.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.428
Ma'am.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.604
[cans clattering]

06:48.207 --> 06:49.641
Here, let me
help you.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.343
I am so embarrassed.

06:51.345 --> 06:52.511
Well, you shouldn't be,

06:52.513 --> 06:53.712
It could have happened
to anyone.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.680
[chuckles]

06:55.682 --> 06:58.517
Do you, um,
do you like peaches?

06:58.519 --> 07:01.386
Oh, I only wanted one,
not the whole stack.

07:01.388 --> 07:02.554
Well, here.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.856
My name's dewitt,
dewitt graves.

07:04.858 --> 07:05.991
Nice to meet you.

07:05.993 --> 07:06.958
Mary.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.926
Dunbar.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.895
Nice to meet you, mrs. Dunbar.

07:13.499 --> 07:16.601
Uh, I'm sorry, mrs. Dunbar,
but your tab is full.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.903
I-I can't let you have
anything else

07:17.905 --> 07:19.538
Until you pay it off.

07:21.340 --> 07:22.741
-Oh.
-Sorry.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.343
Here, let me, mrs. Dunbar,
it's my treat.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.912
No, please, you don't
have to do that.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.647
Well, you don't recall

07:28.649 --> 07:30.549
That you did
invite me to supper,

07:30.551 --> 07:32.317
And it's only fair

07:32.319 --> 07:33.752
That I should spring
for the supplies.

07:34.921 --> 07:35.921
Right.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.656
Thank you, mr. Graves.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.791
You're welcome,
mrs. Dunbar.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.594
Please, mr. Yost,
put it on my account.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.863
Certainly.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.704
Hey, albert!

07:52.706 --> 07:53.772
Hi, caleb!

07:53.774 --> 07:56.608
Got any more worms?

07:56.610 --> 07:57.809
Yeah.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.378
I thought I had some.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.780
Guess not.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.815
I'll dig for some.

08:03.817 --> 08:07.953
I gotta catch somethin' today,
even if it's trash fish.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.588
I hate cat-fish.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.889
Not me.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.391
My ma knows how to
cook it real good.

08:13.393 --> 08:17.696
Besides, we're tired
of having potato soup.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.400
As my pa always said,

08:22.402 --> 08:24.436
"a good worm
is the key to fishin'."

08:24.438 --> 08:26.605
Well, hey,
I found one!

08:32.578 --> 08:34.713
You put the cucumbers
in the jar,

08:34.715 --> 08:36.882
Then you add
the pickling spices,

08:36.884 --> 08:39.951
And then you pour in the brine.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.687
You have to do all that
just to get pickles?

08:42.689 --> 08:45.123
Well, it doesn't happen
by magic.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.459
Back home, they were always
just in the serving dish.

08:47.461 --> 08:49.427
Magically.

08:49.429 --> 08:52.364
You'll never guess who
I saw being sweet-talked-to

08:52.366 --> 08:53.465
At the mercantile

08:53.467 --> 08:54.566
By one of
those new miners.

08:54.568 --> 08:55.901
Mary dunbar.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.937
He even bought
all her groceries.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.472
Well, mary's had it
harder than most of us.

09:00.474 --> 09:01.907
That was very nice of him.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.208
Nice?

09:03.210 --> 09:04.609
It's a mistake for mary
to get involved

09:04.611 --> 09:05.744
With one of those men.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.945
I don't think we can judge

09:06.947 --> 09:09.080
Each other's
circumstances, florence.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.516
Are you ready to forget
your noah?

09:12.852 --> 09:16.388
I will never forget my noah,

09:16.390 --> 09:18.823
But at some point, life goes on.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.926
For all of us.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.494
For you, too.

09:22.496 --> 09:23.962
Abigail!

09:23.964 --> 09:25.196
Oh, my lord...

09:25.198 --> 09:26.431
[gasping in panic]
abigail!

09:26.433 --> 09:27.632
Abigail...

09:27.634 --> 09:29.534
Are you all okay?
What happened?

09:29.536 --> 09:31.536
[gasping]

09:31.538 --> 09:32.737
I was walking
up the hill

09:32.739 --> 09:34.639
And I got
all lightheaded.

09:34.641 --> 09:35.640
Sit down.

09:35.642 --> 09:36.608
Yes, sit down,

09:36.610 --> 09:38.143
Get off your feet.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.477
Carla, I think that you should
move in here with me

09:39.479 --> 09:41.613
Where I can keep
my eye on you.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.614
I can't.

09:42.616 --> 09:43.782
I couldn't impose.

09:43.784 --> 09:44.883
It's not
an imposition.

09:44.885 --> 09:45.917
I insist.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.686
What about ephraim?

09:47.688 --> 09:49.521
Oh, carla, there are dozens
of families in coal valley

09:49.523 --> 09:50.488
Who would love to
look after that little boy

09:50.490 --> 09:51.423
While you're here.

09:54.827 --> 09:57.495

10:34.634 --> 10:35.567
For those of you

10:35.569 --> 10:36.668
Inclined toward drink,

10:36.670 --> 10:38.603
There's the bar,

10:38.605 --> 10:41.573
But I recommend you become
a teetotaler like me.

10:41.575 --> 10:42.474
Make sure
you use the soap.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.042
Everyone washes off.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.910
You don't want to get mud
all over tom's bar.

10:45.912 --> 10:47.112
Go on,
get out of here.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.947
Professor.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.483
Please,
it's miss thatcher.

10:51.485 --> 10:55.387
Well, miss thatcher,
I'm billy.

10:55.389 --> 10:57.355
Billy hamilton.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.725
It came back to me--

11:00.727 --> 11:02.627
The end of that
dickinson poem.

11:02.629 --> 11:03.795
Really?

11:03.797 --> 11:05.063
I had it written
in the back of my book

11:05.065 --> 11:06.665
From years ago,

11:06.667 --> 11:08.967
A little journal I keep.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.836
I'm surprised to find
a poetry lover among miners.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.071
Oh, I love poetry.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.674
I've even written
some poems of my own.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.075
Only one of six
in my family

11:17.077 --> 11:19.044
That made it through
secondary school.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.912
Did you attend college?

11:20.914 --> 11:22.714
I had dreams,

11:22.716 --> 11:24.916
But they ended
when my father died.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.519
I'm sorry.

11:28.888 --> 11:30.722
Oh, no, no,
it's all for the best.

11:31.924 --> 11:33.558
I never thought
I'd be a miner.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.160
I found a job
at a mine back east,

11:35.162 --> 11:36.895
Ended up hopping
from mine to mine,

11:36.897 --> 11:39.698
And now here I am.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.501
Well, welcome to coal valley.

11:44.737 --> 11:47.439
Perhaps you could...

11:47.441 --> 11:49.474
Show me around.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.910
Introduce me
to the place.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.812
There's not really
much to see.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.747
Oh, I disagree.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.682
I've never been to
this part of the country.

11:57.684 --> 11:58.950
Out west?

11:58.952 --> 12:01.720
It's beautiful.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.288
Besides, there must
be a reason

12:03.290 --> 12:05.890
Why someone
like you came here.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.426
Maybe you could
show me why.

12:11.697 --> 12:14.232
How about tomorrow?

12:14.234 --> 12:16.935
I'd be happy to.

12:19.638 --> 12:21.840
Then it's a date.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.183
Whoa.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.653
That one's quite
the lady's man.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.797
[laughter and carousing
from saloon]

12:45.799 --> 12:47.766
[lively music playing]

12:56.542 --> 12:59.110
[laughing and joking]

13:05.184 --> 13:06.818
How do you fellows
stay up so late

13:06.820 --> 13:09.320
And then get up for work
the next morning?

13:09.322 --> 13:11.122
We haven't officially met.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.024
I'm billy hamilton.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.993
Jack thornton.

13:16.662 --> 13:19.764
You, uh, got blisters
on your hand.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.801
Oh, that.

13:22.803 --> 13:23.935
It's been a while

13:23.937 --> 13:25.303
Since my last job
digging coal.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.740
Worked most recently
at central union mine,

13:28.742 --> 13:30.275
But they had me behind a desk.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.576
Training me for
something bigger, I guess.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.944
Something bigger?

13:32.946 --> 13:35.413
What brings you to coal valley?

13:35.415 --> 13:37.182
I got tired
of pushing papers.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.783
Saw the job advertised

13:38.785 --> 13:41.419
And decided
I'd get back into the mine.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.955
Well, you are
the first miner I've ever met

13:43.957 --> 13:47.826
That traded an office job
for the pick-axe again.

13:47.828 --> 13:48.927
[miner shouts]
I ain't no cheater!

13:48.929 --> 13:49.994
You take that back.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.796
How about you take this back?

13:51.798 --> 13:53.765
Cut it out!

13:53.767 --> 13:54.833
Back up!

13:54.835 --> 13:55.867
[roaring]

13:59.939 --> 14:02.173
Are you done?

14:02.175 --> 14:03.141
Damn your eyes!

14:03.143 --> 14:04.108
Hey!

14:04.110 --> 14:05.243
Come on.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.612
We're going
across the road.

14:15.387 --> 14:16.955
[morning birdsong]

14:20.993 --> 14:24.028
Don't want you to miss
a day at work, sam.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.865
[groaning sleepily]

14:30.769 --> 14:32.971
[clears throat]

14:32.973 --> 14:34.138
Mind your manners
next time

14:34.140 --> 14:37.108
And I won't have to
have you here.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.343
Actually, it was...

14:38.345 --> 14:40.011
It was kind of
peaceful.

14:50.256 --> 14:53.358
[♪]

14:53.360 --> 14:55.260
Hey, fellas!

14:55.262 --> 14:57.562
Wait up!

15:00.332 --> 15:01.799
My mom says

15:01.801 --> 15:02.800
Your ma is trying
to get a new husband.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.068
My ma?

15:04.070 --> 15:06.437
She was saying it's
one of them new miners.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.672
That ain't true.

15:07.674 --> 15:08.506
Is so.

15:08.508 --> 15:09.874
You're lying.

15:09.876 --> 15:12.076
I'm tellin' you,
it's true.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.918
Look what I found.

15:19.920 --> 15:20.919
Nice.

15:25.724 --> 15:26.691
Good morning,

15:26.693 --> 15:27.926
How's life at the saloon?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.394
It's like living
in a circus.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.329
I need you to send
a telegram

15:31.331 --> 15:33.932
To the superintendent
at central union mine.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.199
Certainly.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.434
I'll label that
"urgent police business"?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.002
Definitely.

15:46.979 --> 15:49.113
Hello, mrs. Dunbar.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.815
Mr. Graves.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.083
Oh, it's just "dewitt."

15:52.085 --> 15:54.452
No one's ever called me
mr. Graves.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.221
Well, then it's just "mary."

15:57.223 --> 15:58.923
I was hoping
I would bump into you.

15:58.925 --> 16:01.159
I wish there were some way
to repay your kindness.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.428
Oh no, that was
my pleasure, ma'am.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.229
Well, thank you.

16:07.099 --> 16:08.900
I'm headed this way.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.303
Um, mary?

16:14.206 --> 16:15.139
Um, I don't want to
put you out,

16:15.141 --> 16:16.207
But, uh,

16:16.209 --> 16:17.442
It has been a while

16:17.444 --> 16:19.277
Since I've had
a home-cooked meal.

16:20.546 --> 16:21.913
Oh...

16:21.915 --> 16:23.381
And we did tell mr. Yost

16:23.383 --> 16:25.049
That you had
invited me to dinner,

16:25.051 --> 16:26.584
So I was thinking

16:26.586 --> 16:28.953
You wouldn't want to make a liar
out of me, would you?

16:28.955 --> 16:30.588
[chuckles] uh..

16:30.590 --> 16:32.090
I could buy
something for it.

16:32.092 --> 16:35.193
A roast maybe?

16:35.195 --> 16:36.627
Oh...

16:36.629 --> 16:39.430
That would be very much
appreciated, but, um...

16:39.432 --> 16:41.733
I'm not sure
how my son, caleb, would feel

16:41.735 --> 16:43.968
About us having a guest.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.570
Oh, of course.

16:45.572 --> 16:46.771
I understand.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.206
I've intruded.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.307
I'm sorry for asking, mary.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.376
Good day.

16:52.578 --> 16:55.346
But, uh, I'm sure
he would be very pleased

16:55.348 --> 16:57.415
To have a hearty meal
for a change.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.919
That's splendid.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.187
Tomorrow night?

17:04.289 --> 17:05.323
Tomorrow night.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.391
The very best.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.159
You tell mr. Yost

17:08.161 --> 17:09.460
To put anything you need
on my account.

17:15.401 --> 17:17.602
This is one of
my favorite spots.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.237
Oh, it's perfect.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.472
When the church burned down,

17:21.474 --> 17:24.342
The town started meeting here
every Sunday for services.

17:24.344 --> 17:27.378
You can feel it.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.280
It's like
god is here with you.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.416
I've only been in coal valley
a short while,

17:31.418 --> 17:34.385
But the town changes you.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.888
When you see people
really helping each other

17:36.890 --> 17:38.589
And loving their neighbor,

17:38.591 --> 17:40.391
It just...

17:40.393 --> 17:43.394
I know it's making me
a better person.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.697
You know, my..

17:46.699 --> 17:50.568
My dad would love
a place like this.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.970
What did he do
for a living?

17:52.972 --> 17:55.540
Ah, he worked with
his hands his whole life.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.909
Stable hand,
harness maker, pick miner.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.445
A man of all trades.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.914
Kind of like me, I suppose.

18:04.149 --> 18:07.318
It must have been
hard for you, losing him.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.554
You know, I've had
some hard knocks,

18:09.556 --> 18:10.955
Throughout my life, but...

18:10.957 --> 18:13.958
I live with hope.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.626
The thing with feathers,

18:15.628 --> 18:17.361
That's my philosophy.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.537
Hello, jack.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.372
How's that hunting going,
any luck?

18:28.374 --> 18:29.307
Well, you don't need
too much luck

18:29.309 --> 18:30.541
In this part of the world.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.844
Just good aim.

18:34.413 --> 18:36.614
Enjoy your walk.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.917
You enjoy your supper.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.285
Thank you, I will.

18:45.324 --> 18:46.224
Hey, ma.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.492
Hi, caleb.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.392
Didn't catch
nothin' for dinner.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.397
What smells
so good?

18:53.399 --> 18:54.599
We're having roast.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.501
Roast?

18:56.503 --> 18:58.069
Wait...

19:03.275 --> 19:05.610
What's he doing here?

19:05.612 --> 19:07.378
His name is mr. Graves,

19:07.380 --> 19:08.646
And he brought us a roast,
so I invited him to supper.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.647
Isn't that wonderful?

19:09.649 --> 19:11.249
I don't want him here.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.583
Caleb...

19:12.585 --> 19:14.218
Caleb,

19:14.220 --> 19:17.388
That would be
rather ungracious of us.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.290
Mr. Graves is here
all alone in a new town.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.391
There's nothing wrong with
showing him

19:20.393 --> 19:21.526
A little hospitality.

19:23.061 --> 19:23.995
Mr. Graves...

19:25.664 --> 19:26.964
This is
my son, caleb.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.066
Nice to meet you, young man.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.369
Hello.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.704
That sure does
smell delicious.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.673
[sternly]
not that one.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.275
It's my dad's spot.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.243
My apologies.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.511
Anything I can do to help, mary?

19:40.513 --> 19:41.479
No, thank you.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.648
Please, have a seat.

19:49.621 --> 19:51.322
Thank you.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.893
Elizabeth...

19:57.162 --> 19:59.297
What you do you
want to do

19:59.299 --> 20:01.165
After coal valley?

20:01.167 --> 20:03.701
What do you mean after?

20:03.703 --> 20:06.103
I mean, this is
a wonderful place,

20:06.105 --> 20:08.439
But... I don't know,

20:08.441 --> 20:13.411
I just, I see something
bigger for you, you know?

20:13.413 --> 20:15.346
Well, I've really
only just begun

20:15.348 --> 20:16.480
My work with the children,

20:16.482 --> 20:18.249
So I haven't given it
much thought,

20:18.251 --> 20:21.519
But... I have some dreams.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.387
And what are they?

20:23.389 --> 20:25.623
I think dreams
are like birthday wishes.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.291
If you say them out loud,
they might not come true.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.127
Very well.

20:30.129 --> 20:32.997
You keep them tucked away.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.167
In the meantime,

20:36.169 --> 20:39.003
I have a little
gift for you.

20:39.005 --> 20:42.406
From someone who loves poetry.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.442
This is my favorite one.

20:46.378 --> 20:48.112
Thank you.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.985
"o my love's
like a red, red rose

20:53.987 --> 20:56.754
"that's newly sprung in June

20:56.756 --> 20:58.556
"o, my love's like the melody

20:58.558 --> 21:01.225
That's sweetly played
in tune--"

21:01.227 --> 21:06.464
"as fair as thou,
my bonnie lass

21:06.466 --> 21:09.267
"so deep in love am I

21:09.269 --> 21:12.536
"and I will love thee still,
my dear

21:12.538 --> 21:15.840
Till all the seas gang dry."

21:15.842 --> 21:18.376
It's beautiful.

21:19.745 --> 21:21.045
It's very familiar,

21:21.047 --> 21:22.413
I can't place the poet, though--

21:22.415 --> 21:23.848
It's probably familiar

21:23.850 --> 21:26.617
Because it plucks the strings
of your heart.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.420
[giggles]

21:29.422 --> 21:30.588
Who is the poet?

21:32.090 --> 21:34.392
You're looking at him.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.560
That's amazing.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.664
Oh, my.

21:39.666 --> 21:42.566
That's wonderful.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.669
Thank you.

21:46.438 --> 21:47.972
Elizabeth...

21:47.974 --> 21:49.473
There's something
I'd like to ask you

21:49.475 --> 21:51.575
About the dance
on Saturday?

21:51.577 --> 21:53.778
Would you honor me

21:53.780 --> 21:56.180
In going with me?

21:56.182 --> 21:58.683
Please.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.151
You are my red,
red rose

22:00.153 --> 22:02.320
Out here in the wild.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.189
I'd like that.

22:18.737 --> 22:21.372
Well, that was, uh,

22:21.374 --> 22:23.741
That was the best roast
I've had in a long time.

22:23.743 --> 22:24.775
It was wonderful,

22:24.777 --> 22:26.711
And we are so grateful,

22:26.713 --> 22:29.113
Aren't we, caleb?

22:30.349 --> 22:33.584
Do you have
any pastimes, caleb?

22:33.586 --> 22:35.353
I bet you like to play
stickball.

22:36.288 --> 22:39.457
May I be excused?

22:39.459 --> 22:40.658
Yes.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.169
Well, I'd best be going, too.

22:52.171 --> 22:53.437
I've got a long week
ahead of me.

22:53.439 --> 22:54.505
I'm sorry,

22:54.507 --> 22:55.840
He's usually
more polite--

22:55.842 --> 22:58.275
Oh, no, no, not at all,
I understand.

22:58.277 --> 23:00.678
I mean, I'm sure
that this has been

23:00.680 --> 23:02.546
Really hard
on the two of you.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.914
Yes.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.584
But...

23:06.586 --> 23:08.452
Today was nice.

23:08.454 --> 23:09.887
It was nice for me, too.

23:09.889 --> 23:14.291
I-I hear that there's
a dance on Saturday.

23:14.293 --> 23:15.526
Yes.

23:15.528 --> 23:16.594
Oh.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.462
I was wondering if ...

23:18.464 --> 23:19.730
You, um...

23:19.732 --> 23:21.766
You wouldn't want
to go with me, would you?

23:21.768 --> 23:22.767
To the dance?

23:23.869 --> 23:25.403
Uh...

23:25.405 --> 23:28.439
I'm honored
that you would ask me, truly.

23:28.441 --> 23:31.642
I would need to think about it.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.444
I hope you understand.

23:33.446 --> 23:34.945
Yes.

23:34.947 --> 23:38.582
That's all a man can ask for,
is a little bit of hope.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.650
Good night--
[fumbling with doorknob]

23:39.652 --> 23:41.519
Mary. Good night.

23:41.521 --> 23:42.620
Good night.

23:50.729 --> 23:52.363
Caleb dunbar,

23:52.365 --> 23:54.899
I have never been
so embarrassed in my life.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.601
How could you be so rude
to our guest?

23:57.603 --> 23:58.869
We don't need his food.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.571
I can catch us fish
whenever we want it.

24:06.311 --> 24:09.313
Caleb, listen to me.

24:09.315 --> 24:13.818
Things don't always turn out
the way we want them to.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.453
Now, I'm your mama,

24:15.455 --> 24:16.754
And I'm going to do
what I have to do

24:16.756 --> 24:18.322
For our family.

24:18.324 --> 24:21.725
Our family was you
and me and pa.

24:24.830 --> 24:29.400
We're not talking about
your pa.

24:30.702 --> 24:33.537
I need to look out for
our future now.

24:33.539 --> 24:36.307
It's what I'm doing as your mom,

24:36.309 --> 24:38.342
And you need to understand that.

24:42.347 --> 24:44.281
Carla, are you sure
you don't want any supper?

24:44.283 --> 24:44.949
No thanks.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.784
I'll just sleep.

24:49.888 --> 24:51.422
How is she feeling?

24:51.424 --> 24:52.690
Well, she has
a slight fever

24:52.692 --> 24:54.158
And she didn't want
any supper.

24:57.462 --> 24:59.497
We did have one, for years,

24:59.499 --> 25:02.566
But she left right after
the mining accident.

25:02.568 --> 25:04.702
[knock on door]

25:07.439 --> 25:08.472
Oh, jack.

25:08.474 --> 25:11.475
Um, come in.

25:18.717 --> 25:23.354
Well, I will be upstairs
if anyone needs me.

25:23.356 --> 25:24.355
Good night.

25:30.061 --> 25:31.295
Glad to see
you got home

25:31.297 --> 25:33.130
Safe and sound from your walk.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.699
Billy happens to be
a perfect gentlemen.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.569
Actually, that's why I'm here.

25:38.571 --> 25:41.705
I don't think you really know
who billy hamilton is.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.341
What's that supposed to mean?

25:44.343 --> 25:45.609
Look, I had my suspicions

25:45.611 --> 25:46.944
About whether he's all
he says he is.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.746
Based on what evidence?

25:48.748 --> 25:50.981
I'm not
ready to say,

25:50.983 --> 25:53.117
But I just want you
to be cautious.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.818
I'd prefer you not go out
walking alone with him

25:54.820 --> 25:55.653
Into the wilderness.

25:55.655 --> 25:56.987
[scoffs]

25:56.989 --> 25:59.657
It wasn't a trek
to the amazon rainforest.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.926
I was just showing him
around coal valley.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.828
He says I'm an excellent guide,
by the way.

26:04.830 --> 26:05.930
I'm sure he did.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.898
Flattery can get you anywhere.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.199
Flattery?

26:09.201 --> 26:12.570
You think I'm in search
of flattery?

26:12.572 --> 26:14.738
No, I'm just saying
he threw down the hay

26:14.740 --> 26:16.707
Where the goats could get at it.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.108
You're calling me a goat?

26:18.110 --> 26:19.476
Pardon my imagery.

26:19.478 --> 26:21.779
I'm not a student of poetry.

26:21.781 --> 26:24.315
But that's the basic idea.

26:25.884 --> 26:27.084
Jack, are you jealous?

26:27.086 --> 26:29.520
Jealous?

26:29.522 --> 26:32.456
I don't have to be jealous
to be concerned.

26:32.458 --> 26:34.425
Well, you need not concern
yourself with me

26:34.427 --> 26:36.060
Or how I spend my time.

26:36.062 --> 26:40.331
Billy happens to be someone
with whom I share an interest.

26:41.733 --> 26:44.468
Good evening.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.772
Ma'am.

26:52.711 --> 26:54.845
[door closes]

27:01.519 --> 27:02.620
[knocking on window]

27:10.962 --> 27:12.196
Caleb!

27:12.198 --> 27:13.998
You're here early.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.766
Yeah.

27:15.768 --> 27:18.836
Well, um...

27:18.838 --> 27:20.638
Can I ask you a question,
miss thatcher?

27:20.640 --> 27:22.106
Of course.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.741
The new miners...

27:23.743 --> 27:24.842
Mm-hmm?

27:24.844 --> 27:26.143
What do you
think of them?

27:26.145 --> 27:28.679
I think they can be loud,

27:28.681 --> 27:31.649
And sometimes
they interrupt our class,

27:31.651 --> 27:33.083
But they're here
to reopen the mine,

27:33.085 --> 27:35.419
And I think
that's a good thing,

27:35.421 --> 27:36.687
Because it means

27:36.689 --> 27:38.889
It will bring prosperity
back to coal valley.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.090
I don't like them.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.058
Oh?

27:41.060 --> 27:42.493
Why is that?

27:42.495 --> 27:44.128
I just don't.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.930
Well, have you met
any of them?

27:46.932 --> 27:49.099
My mom invited one
over for dinner, and...

27:49.101 --> 27:50.467
Oh.

27:50.469 --> 27:51.969
I didn't like it.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.071
I see.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.739
Caleb, I understand.

27:55.741 --> 27:57.574
Sometimes in life--

27:57.576 --> 27:58.642
[door opens,
heavy footsteps tromp]

27:59.678 --> 28:01.645
Just forget it.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.553
Miss thatcher.

28:09.555 --> 28:11.121
Mary!

28:11.123 --> 28:12.089
I'm so glad you came over.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.524
I was hoping to talk--

28:13.526 --> 28:16.093
I wonder if might
ask for a big favor?

28:16.095 --> 28:17.795
Of course.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.267
[gasps]

28:23.269 --> 28:24.868
I don't know.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.071
Oh...

28:27.073 --> 28:28.872
That is beautiful.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.808
[laughs] I've never worn
anything like this

28:30.810 --> 28:32.142
In my whole life.

28:32.144 --> 28:37.314
I would be honored to let you
borrow it, mary,

28:37.316 --> 28:38.782
But...

28:38.784 --> 28:40.818
You think I'd look ridiculous

28:40.820 --> 28:42.186
Wearing this to that dance,
don't you?

28:42.188 --> 28:43.253
No, no, no,

28:43.255 --> 28:44.988
That's not it.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.490
It's just...

28:47.926 --> 28:49.993
Caleb.

28:49.995 --> 28:52.930
He came to see me at school.

28:54.966 --> 28:57.868
About dewitt graves
having supper with us?

28:59.504 --> 29:00.604
He didn't mention a name,

29:00.606 --> 29:03.207
But it's safe to say
he's upset.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.309
I know what he thinks,

29:05.311 --> 29:08.078
But he's too young
to see the whole picture.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.247
I wish he knew
what I was trying to do

29:10.249 --> 29:12.082
Was protect him.

29:12.084 --> 29:15.085
Mr. Graves is a good man

29:15.087 --> 29:19.723
And he's asked me to be
on his arm at the dance.

29:20.892 --> 29:22.960
And I believe he might...

29:22.962 --> 29:25.162
Care for me.

29:26.297 --> 29:28.098
And I...

29:28.100 --> 29:29.867
I never thought

29:29.869 --> 29:32.035
That another man would ever
pay attention to me again,

29:32.037 --> 29:35.606
And I'm just, I'm not willing
to waste another minute

29:35.608 --> 29:36.940
Frittering away my son's future

29:36.942 --> 29:38.809
When this could be
a chance for us.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.644
I understand.

29:40.646 --> 29:43.380
I really do, I'm just...
Cautioning you.

29:43.382 --> 29:48.118
I don't think you do
understand.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.920
You were raised with
all of the options in the world

29:49.922 --> 29:51.255
Available to you,

29:51.257 --> 29:53.991
And I have next to nothing.

29:56.828 --> 29:59.363
I don't think I'll be
borrowing this dress after all.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.764
Thank you.

30:00.766 --> 30:02.099
I'm going to make
one of my own work.

30:04.936 --> 30:06.003
Mary...

30:12.076 --> 30:15.979
Rip, old boy, I'm home.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.781
I am moving in.

30:17.783 --> 30:22.186
I have had enough of that saloon
and all of those noisy miners.

30:24.122 --> 30:25.889
[sighing]

30:27.125 --> 30:28.058
I've slept on worse.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.026
[door bursts open]

30:29.028 --> 30:30.794
Constable?

30:30.796 --> 30:32.830
Ma'am.

30:32.832 --> 30:35.799
Somebody stole
my late husband's gold watch.

30:35.801 --> 30:37.868
Someone broke into your house?

30:37.870 --> 30:38.769
Right in the middle
of the night

30:38.771 --> 30:40.904
With my child slumbering nearby.

30:40.906 --> 30:43.674
They got the watch
and his cufflinks

30:43.676 --> 30:45.108
Out of my top dresser drawer.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.877
When did you notice
it was gone?

30:46.879 --> 30:47.811
10 minutes ago.

30:47.813 --> 30:49.246
It must have happened last night

30:49.248 --> 30:51.014
Because I saw them there
yesterday.

30:51.016 --> 30:54.618
Mrs. Blakeley, can you
keep this to yourself?

30:55.820 --> 30:58.222
Well, I'll do my best.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.090
And I'm going to look into it
as soon as I can,

31:00.092 --> 31:01.024
I just don't want
whoever took it

31:01.026 --> 31:03.293
To get nervous and leave town.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.328
Understand?

31:06.931 --> 31:09.600
Okay.

31:14.439 --> 31:17.641
Just hang them
about every five feet.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.243
That's wonderful.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.311
Now, for the rest of
you boys and girls,

31:21.313 --> 31:22.412
Who are working on
arithmetic,

31:22.414 --> 31:25.249
We have a garden
full of fruit trees.

31:25.251 --> 31:28.285
[chalk scrapes on chalkboard]
one half of the trees are apple,

31:28.287 --> 31:32.256
One quarter
of the trees are peach

31:32.258 --> 31:34.458
And one-sixth of the trees
are plum.

31:34.460 --> 31:39.129
The remaining 200 trees
are cherry trees.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.697
How many trees
are in the garden?

31:40.699 --> 31:41.665
[children screaming]

31:41.667 --> 31:43.967
[screaming in panic]

31:45.136 --> 31:46.803
Oh, my goodness!

31:46.805 --> 31:48.038
[screaming]

31:49.807 --> 31:50.874
Are you okay?

31:52.911 --> 31:55.045
It's all right.

31:56.114 --> 31:57.080
It's all right...

32:04.956 --> 32:06.189
It's just a harmless
gopher snake.

32:06.191 --> 32:07.791
[aghast]
get that out of here.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.126
Yeah.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.262
Caleb?

32:12.264 --> 32:13.997
You can claim him
this afternoon

32:13.999 --> 32:14.965
In my office

32:14.967 --> 32:16.233
Now!

32:21.005 --> 32:23.040
It's okay. It's okay...

32:26.878 --> 32:27.811
[sighs in shock]

32:27.813 --> 32:30.881
Caleb?

32:39.424 --> 32:42.693
Why did you bring
a snake to school, caleb?

32:42.695 --> 32:44.494
I suppose I'm going to

32:44.496 --> 32:47.230
Have to speak to
your mother about this.

32:47.232 --> 32:48.198
I don't care.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.067
I know that's not true.

32:51.769 --> 32:55.739
I saw her trying to fix up
her prettiest dress.

32:55.741 --> 32:59.176
It's because she's going
to the dance with... Him.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.178
Mr. Graves?

33:01.180 --> 33:03.447
I know
he lives upstairs.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.782
I figured I could put it
in his boot,

33:05.784 --> 33:08.151
And he'd get scared,

33:08.153 --> 33:12.889
And then my ma would see
he's a coward.

33:12.891 --> 33:16.326
Not like my pa.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.996
He wasn't afraid of snakes.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.832
You miss your pa, don't you?

33:21.834 --> 33:23.800
Ma never
talks about him.

33:23.802 --> 33:26.069
It's like she wants to forget.

33:26.071 --> 33:29.639
Maybe she doesn't
want to make you sad.

33:29.641 --> 33:33.043
Or it's just too hard for her
to talk about it, too.

33:33.045 --> 33:35.479
Memories can be painful.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.014
They aren't painful.

33:37.016 --> 33:38.849
They're all good.

33:38.851 --> 33:41.818
Tell me about him.

33:41.820 --> 33:43.020
What was he like?

33:43.022 --> 33:45.155
He was strong and...

33:45.157 --> 33:46.990
Tall...

33:46.992 --> 33:49.860
And he was funny sometimes.

33:49.862 --> 33:52.195
He liked to sing...

33:52.197 --> 33:54.297
And whistle.

33:54.299 --> 33:57.367
He liked to fish.

33:57.369 --> 34:01.371
We'd go fishing
and build a fire,

34:01.373 --> 34:04.174
Cook it right on the bank
of the river.

34:06.177 --> 34:09.246
Sounds like he loved you
very much, caleb.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.481
Yeah, he...

34:11.483 --> 34:14.284
I guess he did.

34:14.286 --> 34:17.387
I miss him so much.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.523
Nobody can replace him.

34:19.525 --> 34:20.891
Nobody.

34:28.266 --> 34:31.435
Thank you, abigail.

34:31.437 --> 34:34.171
You and elizabeth
have been most kind.

34:34.173 --> 34:36.139
Dance a waltz for me?

34:36.141 --> 34:37.974
I will.

34:37.976 --> 34:41.044
And I won't be long.

34:52.356 --> 34:53.657
Come in.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.792
My heavens, mary,
you look lovely.

34:57.795 --> 34:58.995
For you.

34:58.997 --> 35:00.597
Thank you.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.033
I'll put these in water
and go say goodnight to caleb?

35:03.035 --> 35:04.201
Mm-hmm.

35:11.342 --> 35:13.210
[knocks]

35:13.212 --> 35:15.312
I'm leaving now, caleb.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.547
Are you sure you don't
want to come with us?

35:20.985 --> 35:22.986
I love you.

36:06.631 --> 36:09.199
[gasping in wonder]

36:09.201 --> 36:10.734
Wow, it looks like

36:10.736 --> 36:12.269
Something out of
peter pan.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.437
Oh, those little hands
did a beautiful job.

36:14.439 --> 36:16.306
They really did.

36:16.308 --> 36:19.309
Amazing.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.112
I would never have
recognized this place.

36:22.114 --> 36:23.613
Wow, boy, it sure
makes a miner

36:23.615 --> 36:25.615
Feel awfully lucky.

36:27.718 --> 36:31.188
[hum of conversation]

36:31.190 --> 36:33.223
[tuning up instruments]

36:33.225 --> 36:34.257
Hello!

36:34.259 --> 36:36.393
Welcome,
welcome, everyone!

36:36.395 --> 36:38.962
First, we would like to greet
our miner friends

36:38.964 --> 36:40.530
Who are new to town.

36:40.532 --> 36:43.033
This is coal valley's way
of showing you hospitality,

36:43.035 --> 36:45.602
And it's been quite some time

36:45.604 --> 36:47.470
Since we've had
something to celebrate.

36:47.472 --> 36:49.406
So, musicians,
enough of that tuning up,

36:49.408 --> 36:51.641
Let's start with a two-step!

36:51.643 --> 36:55.178
[♪]

37:27.211 --> 37:30.547
[song ends,
everyone applauds]

37:34.585 --> 37:37.087
[♪]

37:43.194 --> 37:45.595
Have you ever
danced the waltz, mr. Backus?

37:45.597 --> 37:47.631
A long time ago,
before all my troubles.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.199
Well, would you like
to try again?

37:49.201 --> 37:51.101
No one will dance
with the likes of me.

37:51.103 --> 37:53.970
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

37:55.473 --> 37:57.274
[♪]

38:54.632 --> 38:56.800
May I?

39:05.643 --> 39:07.344
I miss him, mom.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.648
Caleb...

39:11.650 --> 39:13.216
I miss him, too, honey.

39:13.218 --> 39:15.518
I miss your pa so much.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.490
Here.

39:24.595 --> 39:27.230
[♪]

39:58.396 --> 40:00.263
[gasps in shock]

40:02.833 --> 40:04.300
Carla...

40:04.302 --> 40:05.702
Oh, carla,
I'm so sorry.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.537
I should have never
left you.

40:07.539 --> 40:08.705
It's my fault.

40:08.707 --> 40:11.207
I should have listened to you.

40:11.209 --> 40:13.410
I think the baby's coming.

40:20.217 --> 40:24.888
Wow, look at
all the stars.

40:24.890 --> 40:27.257
Do you see
orion's belt?

40:27.259 --> 40:28.324
[chuckling ]I do.

40:28.326 --> 40:30.360
There he is,

40:30.362 --> 40:32.429
Still looking
for his love,

40:32.431 --> 40:33.897
Artemis.

40:33.899 --> 40:36.266
Will he ever find her?

40:36.268 --> 40:37.167
I hope he does.

40:38.202 --> 40:40.703
She's so lovely.

40:41.772 --> 40:42.705
Winter's coming.

40:42.707 --> 40:45.408
I'm freezing.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.752
Thank you.

40:56.821 --> 41:00.156
Of course.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.900
Constable!

41:12.837 --> 41:14.571
This came in for you

41:14.573 --> 41:16.372
Just before
the dance started.

41:19.677 --> 41:20.677
Thanks, ned.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.245
Certainly.

41:25.749 --> 41:27.717
No record of him...

41:29.487 --> 41:31.421
The man's a liar.

41:34.959 --> 41:39.162
[♪]
