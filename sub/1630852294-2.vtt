00:33.283 --> 00:35.660
Ugh. I've been eating ferns
all day.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.078
I'm still
feeling hungry.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.123
Hey, scoot over!
Otherwise I will bite your nose.

00:41.332 --> 00:43.251
Hi Bears.
I'm Barb.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.253
I'm so glad
I caught you at home.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.005
I've got an announcement
to make.

00:47.088 --> 00:48.757
We told you to go
to the mountain.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.383
Yes, well,
there's another fern up there,

00:50.467 --> 00:53.595
on top of the mountain
who is very supportive.

00:53.678 --> 00:56.264
And that's how I got the idea
to come down here.

00:56.347 --> 01:00.935
Bears, put the ferns down
and listen up.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.730
Some of you are clumsy.
Some of you are sad.

01:03.813 --> 01:07.275
Some of you are eating ferns
to fill the empty hours,

01:07.358 --> 01:11.321
and some of you are doing
all three of those things.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.323
Ow! Clumsy!
Clumsy!

01:13.406 --> 01:14.783
But those things
you mentioned --

01:14.866 --> 01:17.035
we already know that
about ourselves.

01:17.118 --> 01:20.789
But what you don't know
is that you are tired.

01:20.872 --> 01:24.125
It's a condition of the body
and the mind.

01:24.209 --> 01:27.587
Up until now, it has had
no solution,

01:27.670 --> 01:29.714
so I invented one.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.967
Sound Lounging
Every Evening, Please.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.177
SLEEP.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.304
Sounds like a scam.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.056
We're afraid of change.

01:38.139 --> 01:41.351
Okay, I can see you're
an intelligent crowd,

01:41.434 --> 01:44.103
not willing to grab
at the first sales pitch.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.689
So let me show you
how sleep works.

01:46.773 --> 01:47.982
I need a volunteer.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.819
You sir, the one
who is "all three."

01:50.902 --> 01:52.028
Who? Me? Ow!

01:52.111 --> 01:53.404
Go on, Chet!

01:53.488 --> 01:55.657
We'll eat her if she tries
anything funny.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.994
You're not gonna tickle me
or anything?

02:00.078 --> 02:01.496
There's been someone going
around the island

02:01.579 --> 02:04.707
tickling bears'
bare bear-paws.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.918
I would <i>never</i> do that.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.754
Now, Chet, how long
have you been up?

02:09.838 --> 02:11.631
Up?
What's "up"?

02:11.714 --> 02:14.676
How long have you been moving
around and doing things?

02:14.759 --> 02:17.095
Eating ferns?
Poking your friends?

02:17.178 --> 02:18.763
I guess between
two and five days

02:18.847 --> 02:20.849
because that's how long
we've existed.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.685
Well, the first thing
I want you to do

02:23.768 --> 02:26.688
is to just lie down
on your back.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.773
Like this?

02:28.857 --> 02:30.275
Yes.

02:30.358 --> 02:33.403
But I don't like to reveal
my soft underbelly to the world.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.864
My duty is to protect
the island.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.156
Don't worry, Chet.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.868
The other bears
have got you covered.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.494
Do they, though?

02:41.578 --> 02:44.914
I sometimes feel if I don't
protect the island, who will?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.416
Know what I mean?

02:46.499 --> 02:47.542
Hmph!

02:47.625 --> 02:49.043
Don't worry about
that now.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.504
I think you're really
going to enjoy sleep.

02:51.588 --> 02:56.134
Just close your eyes, Chet,
and then you'll see.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.177
I don't see anything.
Hello.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.721
Exactly.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.222
Hey, other bears.

03:01.306 --> 03:05.059
Come and take a look
at how nice <i>sleep</i> can be.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.186
He was so young.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.188
Two to five days.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.900
Hey! Sleep is not
the same thing as death.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.985
What's sleep like, Chet?

03:14.068 --> 03:15.737
I can't talk.
I'm asleep.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.614
See, Chet?

03:17.697 --> 03:18.948
Now you're getting it.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.199
How is it?

03:20.283 --> 03:22.243
I'm not a fan.
This thing you call sleep?

03:22.327 --> 03:23.995
It's just worrying
in the dark.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.246
Call it what it is, Barb.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.831
Call it what it is.

03:26.915 --> 03:30.752
It looks like sleep doesn't come
with an on-and-off switch.

03:30.835 --> 03:32.962
Sleep is more
of a gradual thing,

03:33.046 --> 03:36.758
like being lowered slowly
into a bottomless well.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.051
Geez, Barb.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.720
I guess we need
a little ramp-down,

03:40.803 --> 03:42.096
a sleep ritual.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.682
What are some of the things
that make you happy?

03:44.766 --> 03:47.060
I guess I like
bumping into things?

03:47.143 --> 03:48.436
I mean, I do it a lot.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.855
Oh, eating ferns is
always something I enjoy.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.357
Hmm.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.568
I'm thinking of something
that makes you feel relaxed

03:55.652 --> 03:56.986
and a little lazy.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.739
What would make you stop
worrying about the island

03:59.822 --> 04:01.282
for a few minutes?

04:01.366 --> 04:04.118
Well, sometimes I get relaxed
when I hear a bird singing.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.411
I'll realize I've been looking
at the bird

04:05.495 --> 04:07.914
for I don't even know
how long.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.374
Oh, guess what else?

04:09.457 --> 04:11.292
Well, my right shoulder's
a little lower than the other,

04:11.376 --> 04:14.003
so sometimes it feels good
if someone lifts it up a little

04:14.087 --> 04:15.505
so that they're even.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.340
Ahhh, yeah.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.466
Tweet, tweet!

04:18.549 --> 04:19.968
I'm gettin' into it.

04:20.051 --> 04:23.096
I'm thinkin' one more thing
to seal this deal.

04:23.179 --> 04:26.099
Well, if I'm being honest,

04:26.182 --> 04:28.434
I kinda liked
the tickle thing.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.936
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

04:30.019 --> 04:31.229
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.439
Shoulder move.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.899
Ooooh!

04:34.983 --> 04:36.651
He looks so peaceful.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.903
He doesn't even
look like Chet.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.114
Okay, Barb, put us
to sleep, too.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.657
Make us like Chet.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.158
This is great.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.202
Now that I've got
the sleep ritual figured out,

04:46.286 --> 04:48.329
I can go into
mass production.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.332
Waylon!
Meet me in the back of the cave.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.752
Hmm.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.379
Tweet, tweet,
tweet, tweet, tweet.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.006
Huh? What's that?
Did I hear a bird?

04:58.089 --> 04:59.549
I'm scared of birds!

04:59.632 --> 05:02.218
They fly around in the air
and leave things on my head!

05:02.301 --> 05:05.805
- Relax, Waylon.
- Barb! Put me to sleep!

05:05.888 --> 05:07.223
Lie back down, Waylon.

05:07.306 --> 05:08.933
I'll be back in a bit.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.019
This is a lot of work.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.271
Okay, honey,
what's your name?

05:13.354 --> 05:14.647
Dolly.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.900
Okay, Dolly, just relax
and think happy thoughts.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.528
Tickle, tickle, tickle!
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.655
Shoulder move.
Ow!

05:22.739 --> 05:24.323
What are you doing
to my shoulder?

05:24.407 --> 05:25.867
I am delicate!

05:25.950 --> 05:28.911
I knew it was a scam.
Just like Waylon said.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.913
What are we gonna do
with Barb?

05:30.997 --> 05:32.206
Eat her?

05:32.290 --> 05:36.753
I've gotta get me
some Barb-E-Q sauce.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.088
<i>Barb-E-Q.</i>

05:39.172 --> 05:41.049
We get it, Waylon.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.633
Wait, wait, wait.
Gimme a second.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.719
It looks like
the same sleep ritual

05:44.802 --> 05:47.221
is not going to work
on every bear.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.682
So I need a little more time
to come up

05:49.766 --> 05:53.061
with a personalized
sleep ritual for each of you.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.938
Now, how many bears
have we got lined up?

05:56.022 --> 05:59.067
One, two, three, four,
Chet's asleep already.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.610
- Any more bears around?

06:03.446 --> 06:04.989
Oh! Oh. Okay.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.492
<i>Now, there is no way
I can do this on my own.</i>

06:07.575 --> 06:09.243
<i>I know I need more me's.</i>

06:09.327 --> 06:11.204
<i>Now, where have I seen
a me before?</i>

06:11.287 --> 06:13.498
<i>Ah! Oh, yeah!
In the jelly pool!</i>

06:13.581 --> 06:15.249
<i>Dang, I looked good.</i>

06:15.333 --> 06:17.126
I'll be right back, bears.

06:25.009 --> 06:27.178
There you are.
Come here, you.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.472
Help me put
these bears to sleep.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.350
Up we go!

06:32.433 --> 06:34.102
Happy Birthday, Barb.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.354
Wait, me?
I'm not Barb.

06:36.437 --> 06:37.730
I'm Helen With Bananas.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.274
I like musicals, motorcycles,
and good grammar,

06:40.358 --> 06:42.443
and I hate raisins!

06:42.527 --> 06:44.195
Incredible!

06:44.278 --> 06:46.864
I ask for another Barb
to help with those bears,

06:46.948 --> 06:50.493
and you outdo yourself
with a brand-new Helen instead.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.624
Perfect!
I love it!

06:56.707 --> 06:58.584
Come on, gals!
Beep, beep!

06:58.668 --> 07:00.962
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold your horses, Barb.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.047
We haven't all introduced
ourselves yet.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.341
I mean, you are absolutely
right, Helen.

07:05.424 --> 07:06.801
By all means.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.720
Well, you've already met me,
Helen with Bananas.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.807
And I'm Patrice.
I come with a recorder.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.810
I like physics, good listeners,
and the beach.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.311
Lovely.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.479
An I'm Sandy.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.064
I come with
a prescription pad.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.484
I like sloths, prescriptions,
and action movies.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.027
Yippie-ki-yay!

07:25.111 --> 07:26.362
And I'm Rose.

07:26.445 --> 07:28.072
I've got this giant hammer,

07:28.156 --> 07:30.241
and I think brushing
your teeth is a scam.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.076
Uh-huh, yeah.
Okay.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.995
What about you, Barb?

07:34.078 --> 07:38.166
Oh! Well,
I'm Barb and I -- I...

07:38.249 --> 07:41.252
when I think about
bears not sleeping,

07:41.335 --> 07:43.504
it makes me feel crazy.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.092
- Hmm!
- Hup!
- Hup!

07:48.176 --> 07:50.011
All right,
listen up, you bears.

07:50.094 --> 07:53.097
Helen, Patrice, Rose,
and Sandy are new here,

07:53.181 --> 07:57.351
and I want y'all to be nice and
give them a warm welcome, okay?

07:57.435 --> 07:59.687
Oh, we'll give 'em
a warm welcome, all right.

07:59.770 --> 08:02.190
Inside our piping-hot
stomachs!

08:03.524 --> 08:05.234
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.028
If we can't get them all
to sleep,

08:07.111 --> 08:09.447
they're gonna eat us all,
straight-up.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.161
All right, Dolly,
You're up first.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.287
Hit the dirt.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.497
Helen, it's your time
to shine.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.209
Get out there
and show us your SKILLS.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.543
My what?

08:22.627 --> 08:26.380
Some Kind of Imaginative
Lovely Lady Soothing.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.882
SKILLS!

08:27.965 --> 08:30.551
Get out there and show us
what you got.

08:34.263 --> 08:36.474
Hello.
Hi.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.851
Are you gonna lift
my shoulder, too?

08:38.935 --> 08:42.355
Please don't.
I have very sensitive bones.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.898
Oh, no, I wasn't.

08:43.981 --> 08:46.734
I -- I just have
these bananas.

08:46.817 --> 08:48.653
You can have one.

08:48.736 --> 08:53.324
They're, um...
they're good for...

08:53.407 --> 08:54.617
bones?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.786
Really?

08:56.869 --> 08:59.372
Oh, yeah.
I feel it!

08:59.455 --> 09:01.582
Mm.
Mmm.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.960
I feel so good
and relaxed now.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.628
My bones...

09:08.589 --> 09:09.924
Did everybody see that?

09:10.007 --> 09:11.592
Now, that's how you do it.

09:11.676 --> 09:16.847
Okay, now let's all GOTASRB
like our lives depended on it!

09:16.931 --> 09:20.268
Get Out There And Relax
