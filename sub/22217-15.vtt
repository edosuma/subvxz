WEBVTT

00:11.844 --> 00:14.001
- <i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...
- Let's do this.

00:14.069 --> 00:16.201
I can't believe I have
been drowning in guilt.

00:16.203 --> 00:18.337
- I let Jeff bug our server.
- You what?!

00:18.339 --> 00:19.972
You were right. Jeff's playing me.

00:19.974 --> 00:22.641
I control everything. Including Fallon.

00:22.643 --> 00:25.444
I am done with you.
And I am done with Jeff.

00:25.446 --> 00:26.912
No, you're not.

00:26.914 --> 00:29.214
You're gonna marry that son of a bitch.

00:29.216 --> 00:31.984
<i>I wasn't a drug
addict as your father claimed</i>

00:31.986 --> 00:33.418
<i>to the rest of the world.</i>

00:33.420 --> 00:35.554
Your father framed me.

00:35.556 --> 00:37.689
This is the number of
an immigration lawyer.

00:37.691 --> 00:38.891
Don't screw it up.

00:38.893 --> 00:41.026
<i>You'll break more than
one heart if you do.</i>

00:48.402 --> 00:51.103
What? I asked for violet campions.

00:51.105 --> 00:54.304
Yes. But that flower only
grows on the Rock of Gibraltar.

00:54.339 --> 00:55.040
It's quite rare.

00:55.042 --> 00:58.010
So? The Carringtons and the
Colbys are getting married.

00:58.012 --> 01:00.179
Our flowers will be picked off the cold,
hard surface

01:00.181 --> 01:02.281
of your ass if we want them to be.

01:03.617 --> 01:05.551
Is that a swan?

01:05.553 --> 01:07.519
One of five for the indoor fountain.

01:07.521 --> 01:09.254
What happened to the peacocks?

01:09.256 --> 01:11.390
Peacocks can't swim.

01:12.667 --> 01:14.359
Well, how much would it cost
to teach them?

01:14.361 --> 01:15.527
What the hell are you doing?

01:17.898 --> 01:20.232
I am not paying for all this. My study.

01:20.234 --> 01:22.234
Oh, come on.

01:22.236 --> 01:25.370
It's your big day too, Blake.

01:27.441 --> 01:29.875
You told me to plan a ceremony.

01:30.846 --> 01:34.246
The plan was to make it <i> seem</i>
like we were having a wedding

01:34.248 --> 01:36.782
so Jeff would apply for
Cecil's house-arrest waiver.

01:36.784 --> 01:38.083
Now that they have it,
and they're coming here

01:38.085 --> 01:39.117
for the rehearsal today,

01:39.119 --> 01:40.219
would you stop spending my money?

01:40.221 --> 01:41.520
You said that your IT team

01:41.522 --> 01:44.156
needs at least two hours
to get into the house

01:44.158 --> 01:46.124
and to erase Jeff's server, right?

01:46.126 --> 01:48.160
Well, that means
we need a long rehearsal,

01:48.162 --> 01:50.162
final decisions to settle on:
swans or peacocks.

01:50.164 --> 01:51.396
Just trust me.

01:51.398 --> 01:52.731
If Jeff doesn't believe
that we're planning

01:52.733 --> 01:54.132
the party of the century,
then he'll know

01:54.134 --> 01:55.601
that the last two
weeks have been a sham.

01:55.603 --> 01:57.951
Fine. At least I don't
have to buy a wedding gown.

01:57.986 --> 01:58.865
There you go.

01:58.906 --> 02:00.539
Think of what I'm saving you.

02:00.541 --> 02:02.541
It's a hell of a lot cheaper
than getting arrested.

02:02.543 --> 02:04.276
Or losing your entire company,
which you could have

02:04.278 --> 02:06.278
if Jeff had used any of the
blackmail on his server.

02:07.648 --> 02:08.580
Oh.

02:08.582 --> 02:09.848
Speaking of shams,

02:09.850 --> 02:11.950
Mrs. Flake Carrington.

02:13.358 --> 02:15.387
I still can't believe
you're making her do this.

02:15.389 --> 02:17.789
Oh, he's not making me do anything.

02:17.791 --> 02:21.260
Unlike you, I believe in
solving problems I help create.

02:21.262 --> 02:23.295
You told her about Rick?

02:23.297 --> 02:24.696
We're all on the same team, aren't we?

02:24.698 --> 02:27.366
I got a full report from my IT guys...

02:27.368 --> 02:29.935
what Colby had access to,
what he might've fed Rick...

02:29.937 --> 02:33.372
and it included records of
Steven's rehab reservations.

02:33.374 --> 02:34.506
When did Steven go to rehab?

02:34.508 --> 02:35.707
Well, that's the problem. He didn't.

02:35.709 --> 02:37.309
He was supposed to check
in after Christmas.

02:37.311 --> 02:38.777
Considering that he
told Rick and the press

02:38.779 --> 02:41.713
and the police that he's been
clean for several years...

02:41.715 --> 02:44.483
In other words,
thanks to you and Ricky Ricardo,

02:44.485 --> 02:46.084
Steven might have the most to lose.

02:46.086 --> 02:48.253
And Steven still has no idea
that all this today is an act?

02:48.255 --> 02:50.022
It's called plausible deniability.

02:50.024 --> 02:53.792
I'll write it down for you.
You can Google it later.

02:55.193 --> 02:56.295
Choose carefully.

02:56.297 --> 02:59.564
Make sure you pick the one that
best shows off your two-faces.

02:59.566 --> 03:01.133
Come on, Sam.

03:01.135 --> 03:02.701
You know this was out of my control.

03:02.703 --> 03:05.170
Just because you have to keep
playing Ted's heartbroken boyfriend,

03:05.172 --> 03:06.805
it doesn't mean you have to evict me.

03:06.807 --> 03:09.007
As if you're not excited to
reclaim your chaise by the pool.

03:09.009 --> 03:10.943
A little.

03:10.945 --> 03:14.446
If the press finds out
that we are more than roommates,

03:14.448 --> 03:17.516
or even <i> just</i> roommates,
while I'm still supposedly with Ted...

03:17.518 --> 03:18.984
don't you think that'll look suspicious?

03:18.986 --> 03:21.620
The last thing you need is
anyone asking questions,

03:21.622 --> 03:23.755
given your visa status.

03:23.757 --> 03:25.290
What are you doing about that, anyway?

03:25.292 --> 03:27.159
It's gonna take a hot second.

03:27.161 --> 03:29.861
Not like I have anyone to
marry for a green card.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.466
Once Anders' lawyers get back to me,
I should be able

03:34.468 --> 03:36.301
to get my student visa reactivated.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.769
I don't know if it'll be that simple.

03:37.771 --> 03:41.106
Well, I have to get Fallon to
give me an employment sponsorship.

03:41.108 --> 03:43.442
And then I have to go back to school,
and stay in school.

03:43.444 --> 03:44.710
And then I have to apply for...

03:44.712 --> 03:46.011
Considering this country's
obsession with walls,

03:46.013 --> 03:48.647
and Fallon's preoccupation
with her wedding,

03:48.649 --> 03:50.582
I might have a better chance
of getting elected and changing

03:50.584 --> 03:52.184
the immigration system first.

03:52.728 --> 03:53.952
Not with that photo.

03:59.660 --> 04:01.860
What's this?

04:03.097 --> 04:06.898
A reminder of my reason for everything.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.266
The pattern symbolizes...

04:08.268 --> 04:11.236
Protection of family. I know.

04:11.238 --> 04:13.472
And the blue is for togetherness.

04:13.474 --> 04:15.807
I thought you could
wear it to the wedding.

04:17.084 --> 04:18.209
I know you don't want me
to go through with it...

04:18.212 --> 04:21.613
The one thing I know about you
is I can't tell you what to do.

04:22.883 --> 04:24.816
I remember when you were six years old.

04:25.597 --> 04:27.652
I took you to church.

04:27.654 --> 04:29.888
Told you you couldn't
participate in the communion

04:29.890 --> 04:31.757
'cause you didn't
understand what it meant.

04:31.759 --> 04:34.426
You sat on the other side
of your mother on purpose

04:34.428 --> 04:36.428
so I couldn't stop you from
reaching for the bread and wine.

04:36.430 --> 04:38.130
I don't remember that.

04:38.132 --> 04:39.464
You understood what
the bread represented.

04:39.466 --> 04:41.600
You said, "Body of Christ"

04:41.602 --> 04:44.903
and I didn't say anything,
but I thought... smart boy.

04:44.905 --> 04:47.005
"And what about the wine?" I asked.

04:47.007 --> 04:50.575
And you sat there, thinking.

04:50.577 --> 04:53.945
Then you finally said, "Good luck?"

04:55.119 --> 04:57.167
Now, you see,
that's how you've always been.

04:57.251 --> 04:58.617
An arrogant boy.

04:58.619 --> 05:00.552
Maybe if you were marrying for love

05:00.554 --> 05:02.587
I wouldn't say anything,
but marrying this girl

05:02.589 --> 05:03.688
for that revenge...

05:03.690 --> 05:05.757
Blake didn't just take Mom from you.

05:05.759 --> 05:07.626
He took you from me.

05:07.628 --> 05:09.161
For 11 years.

05:10.322 --> 05:13.999
That's my pain,
even if you don't understand it.

05:14.001 --> 05:15.767
I'm taking his daughter.

05:15.769 --> 05:17.536
I'm taking his company, bit by bit.

05:17.538 --> 05:20.772
And he will feel it. And he will suffer.

05:20.774 --> 05:23.208
And we will stay together this time.

05:24.302 --> 05:25.911
Ready for the show?

05:25.913 --> 05:29.214
You can follow my lead. Obviously.

05:29.216 --> 05:32.684
Fallon, I can't imagine how
stressful this all is for you.

05:32.686 --> 05:34.619
I just want you to
know I'm here for you.

05:34.621 --> 05:35.854
Oh, but you're not.

05:35.856 --> 05:37.589
You see,
the difference between you and me

05:37.591 --> 05:40.192
is that I'll do whatever it
takes to stand by this family.

05:40.194 --> 05:42.627
And when Dad asked you to see
what else Rick knew, you bailed.

05:42.629 --> 05:44.796
He was essentially asking
me to whore myself out.

05:44.798 --> 05:47.566
Well, at least Daddy
recognizes your true talent.

05:47.568 --> 05:49.634
All right. I just got an
update from my security team.

05:49.636 --> 05:50.936
They're standing by
outside Colby's house.

05:50.938 --> 05:53.805
The gate called. Jeff's car has arrived.

05:55.409 --> 05:58.510
Okay. We need to keep the whole
family here for two hours.

05:58.512 --> 06:00.812
That'll give the team time to get in,
find the server,

06:00.814 --> 06:03.281
and degauss it,
so whatever you can do to stall...

06:03.283 --> 06:04.583
We'll be lucky if we can get
through the hour without you

06:04.585 --> 06:06.251
and Cecil blowing each
other's heads off.

06:08.789 --> 06:10.822
Anders.

06:10.824 --> 06:12.390
Hey, you.

06:14.061 --> 06:16.094
- You ready for this?
- She was born ready.

06:16.096 --> 06:18.396
Well, technically I was
born naked and screaming,

06:18.398 --> 06:19.931
but I've come a long way.

06:19.933 --> 06:22.288
Let me be the first to welcome
you both to the family.

06:22.303 --> 06:25.137
- I believe that's my job.
- But don't jinx it. We're not married yet.

06:25.139 --> 06:26.705
And, uh, where's your father?

06:26.707 --> 06:28.306
He's not coming.

06:29.077 --> 06:31.910
I know I said we'd all be here,
I know it's important...

06:31.912 --> 06:33.578
If Cecil's not here for the rehearsal...

06:33.580 --> 06:35.580
Oh, the good news is he won't
need to rehearse anything,

06:35.582 --> 06:37.315
since he won't be
at the wedding, either.

06:37.317 --> 06:38.817
- Oh.
- Okay.

06:38.819 --> 06:41.319
Who's ready to talk seating charts?

06:44.892 --> 06:46.024
What does this mean?

06:46.026 --> 06:47.492
That we're hosting a wedding tomorrow

06:47.494 --> 06:50.629
and we have 24 hours to
make sure that Cecil's here.

06:50.631 --> 06:52.230
Call the tailor.

06:52.232 --> 06:55.500
Our bride needs a gown after all.

It's not like I'm
actually marrying the guy.

07:19.799 --> 07:21.665
No, you're just madly
hunting for a wedding dress

07:21.667 --> 07:23.066
to not marry him in.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.834
What's the difference
between canceling today

07:24.836 --> 07:26.269
versus tomorrow?

07:26.271 --> 07:28.071
I was always going to have
to say I got cold feet.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.806
Now I'll just have to
get them a little colder

07:29.808 --> 07:31.041
and a little later.

07:31.043 --> 07:33.176
My dad is handling the hard part. Cecil.

07:33.178 --> 07:35.749
Yeah, you just have to have a
wedding and be an actual bride.

07:35.814 --> 07:37.314
Honestly,
I wish we could've picked another

07:37.316 --> 07:39.949
religious ceremony to get
Cecil out of his house arrest.

07:39.951 --> 07:42.519
A funeral seemed tough,
it required a body,

07:42.521 --> 07:44.254
- but in retrospect...
- Fallon,

07:44.256 --> 07:46.589
maybe it's time to
just call all this off.

07:46.591 --> 07:47.824
I know you can't go to the police,

07:47.826 --> 07:50.093
- but there has to be another way.
- If there were,

07:50.095 --> 07:53.430
believe me, we would be doing it.

07:53.432 --> 07:56.733
What kills me the most is that
if this whole thing blows up,

07:56.735 --> 07:57.967
I don't even get to keep Morell Corp.

07:57.969 --> 07:59.736
I mean, all the blood,
sweat and champagne

07:59.738 --> 08:02.405
I've poured into that company...

08:03.709 --> 08:05.008
For me it's a lot.

08:05.010 --> 08:06.943
- I thought you were buying Jeff out.
- Well,

08:06.945 --> 08:08.311
the deal hasn't closed yet.

08:08.313 --> 08:10.513
Now it seems more complicated than ever.

08:10.515 --> 08:14.351
Well, whatever happens with Morell,
you know I'm here for you.

08:15.053 --> 08:16.119
And for Monica.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.255
I'm stuck playing her pretend
boyfriend for the next 24 hours.

08:19.257 --> 08:21.358
Thank you, Michael.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.126
It would be so much
easier if you and I were

08:23.128 --> 08:24.361
getting pretend married.

08:29.057 --> 08:31.301
Sign here for the peacocks.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.970
And then here for the peacock food.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.506
And here for the bird flu shots.

08:36.508 --> 08:37.539
Apparently, they bite.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.976
Well, every party needs a little danger.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.644
Right here.

08:41.645 --> 08:42.979
Wait, what is this?

08:42.981 --> 08:45.982
Nothing you need to worry
your jagged little bangs about.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.485
Just, uh,
put your Herbie Hancock right there.

08:48.487 --> 08:51.588
"Immigration Services
employment sponsorship"?

08:52.229 --> 08:53.656
Are you undocumented?

08:53.658 --> 08:55.133
I'm a citizen of the world.

08:55.227 --> 08:57.694
Sam, am I breaking the law
by having you on my payroll?

08:59.097 --> 09:02.799
Okay, look.
I have too much on my mind right now

09:02.801 --> 09:04.467
to commit immigration fraud,

09:04.469 --> 09:05.902
or whatever it is
you're asking me to do.

09:05.904 --> 09:09.239
Fallon, it's just one stroke of a pen.

09:09.241 --> 09:11.875
I mean, it's easier than
finding good sushi on Postmates.

09:11.877 --> 09:13.943
If all of your problems could be
solved with a simple signature,

09:13.945 --> 09:16.112
I'm guessing you would have
had this handled by now.

09:16.114 --> 09:17.847
Did you talk to your wedding date

09:17.849 --> 09:19.841
about greasing some political palms?

09:19.852 --> 09:22.419
Well, I'll be attending
your wedding stag.

09:22.421 --> 09:24.521
Steven doesn't want anything
to do with me right now

09:24.523 --> 09:26.644
because of my undocumentedness.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.691
But if you happen to know
any eligible bachelors

09:28.693 --> 09:31.327
- that are free tomorrow...
- I'll think about it.

09:31.329 --> 09:33.062
I'm sorry. I'm going to have
to shelve this for now.

09:33.064 --> 09:35.698
Try to avoid deportation
until after the wedding.

09:39.304 --> 09:42.806
Dad, you have a visitor.

09:49.030 --> 09:50.814
Are you gonna be okay?

09:57.589 --> 09:59.656
It isn't me you have to worry about.

10:00.087 --> 10:00.990
Go on.

10:02.828 --> 10:04.828
We'll be fine.

10:10.669 --> 10:12.502
Why the hell are you here?

10:12.504 --> 10:13.937
Bury the hatchet.

10:13.939 --> 10:15.572
Our kids shouldn't have to suffer

10:15.574 --> 10:17.841
for something that
happened a decade ago.

10:18.447 --> 10:20.176
Now, I stand by my story.

10:20.178 --> 10:22.479
I never slept with your wife.

10:22.481 --> 10:24.747
You didn't believe me then,
you don't have to believe me now,

10:24.749 --> 10:29.085
but don't punish my daughter
for something you think I did.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.120
Isn't that the way
the world works, Blake?

10:31.122 --> 10:34.691
No matter how we try to fight it,
our children pay for our sins.

10:34.693 --> 10:35.792
Well, I went to every effort

10:35.794 --> 10:37.760
to make sure Jeff didn't pay for yours.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.196
I paid for his education.

10:40.198 --> 10:43.066
I looked out for him
when he needed guidance.

10:43.068 --> 10:44.734
I treated him like...

10:44.736 --> 10:46.035
like a son.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.705
Don't try and act like
you're here for him.

10:48.707 --> 10:50.640
I'm here for Fallon.

10:50.642 --> 10:52.909
She loves Jeff,

10:52.911 --> 10:56.546
and I know it's not my place
to stand in the way of that.

10:56.548 --> 10:59.883
Now, you always said there was no pain

10:59.885 --> 11:02.051
a good whiskey can't cure.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.322
On the rocks, right?

11:08.727 --> 11:13.563
Now, surely,
Jeff has told you that we've reconciled.

11:13.565 --> 11:15.932
I respect what he's made of himself.

11:15.934 --> 11:17.634
I'm proud, even.

11:19.738 --> 11:22.405
Mr. Carrington, a reminder.

11:22.407 --> 11:23.907
You're due back at the Manor.

11:23.909 --> 11:25.408
Fallon is expecting you.

11:25.410 --> 11:27.443
Yeah.

11:27.445 --> 11:29.379
Can never be too careful.

11:29.381 --> 11:32.715
A big man with a shadow
everywhere he goes, huh?

11:32.717 --> 11:33.883
No, not everywhere.

11:33.885 --> 11:35.518
Only when I leave the house.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.321
Men of my resources are often targets.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.390
Look, we have a choice.

11:40.392 --> 11:42.625
We can stay bitter old men,

11:42.627 --> 11:46.062
or we can make a fresh
start like our kids.

11:46.064 --> 11:47.931
What do you say?

11:51.269 --> 11:53.469
For the sake of my son...

11:53.471 --> 11:55.338
I'll be there tomorrow.

11:59.644 --> 12:01.511
We'll raise a glass then.

12:07.948 --> 12:10.618
Told you your dad was
an excellent negotiator.

12:10.673 --> 12:12.039
Cecil's on board.

12:12.041 --> 12:15.342
How did you get that psycho to
trade his coat of arms for a tux?

12:15.344 --> 12:17.744
I just talked to him,
one concerned father to another.

12:17.746 --> 12:19.212
There's a lie you know how to tell.

12:19.721 --> 12:21.548
Over my dead body

12:21.550 --> 12:24.217
is my granddaughter going
to marry Jeff Colby!

12:24.219 --> 12:26.620
Sir, your father has arrived.

12:26.622 --> 12:28.121
Thank you, Anders.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.489
What the hell are you doing here?

12:29.491 --> 12:32.125
<i>La señorita</i> called me on the <i> teléfono.</i>

12:33.662 --> 12:35.696
- Cristal.
- She called you?

12:35.698 --> 12:37.831
My invitation must've
got lost in the mail.

12:37.833 --> 12:38.899
Again.

12:38.901 --> 12:40.100
It's not what it looks like, Grandpa.

12:40.102 --> 12:41.234
It wasn't supposed to

12:41.236 --> 12:42.269
go this far, but don't worry.

12:42.271 --> 12:43.637
Fallon is not gonna marry Jeff.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.238
Tell that to the swans outside.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.207
- It's a ruse.
- And a long story,

12:47.209 --> 12:50.077
but let's hear it
again for good measure.

12:50.079 --> 12:51.612
Jeff Colby bugged our house.

12:51.614 --> 12:54.411
He's been gathering dirt
on us for months now.

12:54.844 --> 12:56.416
In light of Cecil's house arrest,

12:56.418 --> 12:58.852
this wedding is the only way
that we can get all the Colbys

12:58.854 --> 13:01.922
out of their home so my
security team can break in.

13:01.924 --> 13:04.825
Once they've succeeded in
eradicating his arsenal,

13:04.827 --> 13:05.926
we'll be informed.

13:05.928 --> 13:07.594
And then Fallon will
call off the ceremony

13:07.596 --> 13:08.762
before any vows are exchanged.

13:08.764 --> 13:11.531
The quintessential bride with cold feet.

13:11.533 --> 13:13.834
All of this because of Jeff Colby?

13:13.836 --> 13:16.970
Speaking of which,
my fiancé's back with his lawyers.

13:18.974 --> 13:20.874
Time to make this thing official.

13:20.876 --> 13:23.076
- You ready?
- I've been dreaming of this moment

13:23.078 --> 13:24.878
my entire life.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.147
Only you would fantasize about a prenup.

13:27.149 --> 13:28.782
Oh, well,

13:28.784 --> 13:32.019
I thought we were handling
the sale of Morell first.

13:32.021 --> 13:33.954
I was gonna save that for dessert,

13:33.956 --> 13:35.889
but since you brought it up...

13:38.761 --> 13:41.028
Forget selling. I'm giving it to you.

13:41.030 --> 13:42.829
As a wedding gift.

13:42.831 --> 13:45.632
Along with 25% of Colby Co.

13:45.634 --> 13:47.334
Morell and Colby Co.?

13:48.225 --> 13:50.103
Why the sudden burst of generosity?

13:50.105 --> 13:53.707
Consider it my first task as
your husband: making you happy.

13:53.709 --> 13:55.742
But I do have ulterior motives.

13:55.744 --> 13:58.512
I want you to give me
25% of C.A. in return.

13:58.514 --> 13:59.813
And what would that prove?

13:59.815 --> 14:01.581
That this ridiculous
family feud is over.

14:01.583 --> 14:02.716
But I'd have to wait

14:02.718 --> 14:04.885
to get Morell until
after the wedding, right?

14:04.887 --> 14:06.286
You're the one who said waiting

14:06.288 --> 14:08.121
would only make the
wedding night sweeter.

14:10.492 --> 14:12.926
Then let's wait.

14:12.928 --> 14:14.861
I think we have ourselves a deal.

14:16.598 --> 14:20.300
- And a marriage.
- Hmm.

14:23.472 --> 14:24.838
Dear God, no.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.340
Don't worry.

14:27.342 --> 14:30.110
Rubin Singer is flying in
from New York right now.

14:30.112 --> 14:31.278
Where'd you find that?

14:31.280 --> 14:32.512
Attic.

14:34.508 --> 14:35.315
Is that Mom's?

14:36.292 --> 14:37.617
You know, it's hard
not to imagine what she'd say

14:37.619 --> 14:39.052
about all this.

14:39.054 --> 14:41.288
I mean, I'm not saying I want
her to walk me down the aisle

14:41.290 --> 14:43.123
or anything, but even if I did,

14:43.125 --> 14:44.558
I wouldn't know how to reach her.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.227
Well, I guarantee that if she did come,

14:47.229 --> 14:48.361
she'd be wearing white.

14:50.532 --> 14:52.232
What's wrong?

14:54.136 --> 14:58.171
Well, something came up with Jeff.

14:58.173 --> 15:00.540
I'm trying to decide whether
or not I should tell Dad.

15:00.542 --> 15:01.708
When has anything good ever come

15:01.710 --> 15:03.276
from open communication with Dad?

15:03.278 --> 15:05.245
I know you and Jeff

15:05.247 --> 15:07.547
happened really fast.

15:07.549 --> 15:10.517
To be honest,
I never saw you as Mrs. Anyone.

15:10.519 --> 15:13.720
Except maybe Culhane,
but you're my sister

15:13.722 --> 15:15.856
and I love you and...

15:15.858 --> 15:17.557
all I want is for you to be happy.

15:17.559 --> 15:19.559
Thanks.

15:19.561 --> 15:25.132
So, I heard you chose
undead Ted over Sammy Jo.

15:25.134 --> 15:27.367
Sam mentioned he'd be
rolling solo to the wedding.

15:27.369 --> 15:30.103
I'm learning I have to pick
and choose my priorities.

15:30.105 --> 15:32.139
Well, I thought the whole
point of being a Carrington

15:32.141 --> 15:33.874
is we don't have to
choose between anything.

15:33.876 --> 15:36.276
Might not be the best time to
point out that as of tomorrow,

15:36.278 --> 15:40.347
you'll be less Carrington
and more Fallon Morell Colby.

15:41.025 --> 15:42.048
Don't worry. If you ever do

15:42.050 --> 15:43.683
marry Culhane,
at least you won't have to get

15:43.685 --> 15:45.051
your hand towels re-monogrammed.

15:48.389 --> 15:50.398
<i>So we're just dropping in on City Hall</i>

15:50.433 --> 15:53.160
12 minutes to close for
a wild animal permit?

15:53.162 --> 15:54.728
We're not really here
for the peacocks, okay?

15:54.730 --> 15:56.229
I lied.

15:56.231 --> 15:59.933
We're here because I decided I
actually do want to get married.

16:00.569 --> 16:01.635
To you.

16:03.539 --> 16:06.940
- You what?
- I know I haven't been perfect, okay?

16:06.942 --> 16:08.975
We haven't been perfect, but...

16:08.977 --> 16:12.145
I know I feel the same way about
you that you feel about me.

16:12.147 --> 16:14.315
Your fiancé is okay with this?

16:14.350 --> 16:16.016
Seriously, Michael.
I don't want my first walk

16:16.018 --> 16:18.552
down the aisle to be
with a man that I hate.

16:19.449 --> 16:20.687
I want it to be with you.

16:21.581 --> 16:22.989
What do you want me to say?
Come on, I'm...

16:22.991 --> 16:24.124
I would get down on one knee,

16:24.126 --> 16:25.759
but you know,
in this dress and these heels,

16:25.761 --> 16:27.194
I'd probably never get back up.

16:27.196 --> 16:28.862
You are out of your mind.

16:28.864 --> 16:30.163
What?

16:30.165 --> 16:31.631
What happened to that
little four-letter word

16:31.633 --> 16:33.366
you like to throw in
my face all the time?

16:33.368 --> 16:35.168
You mean love?

16:35.170 --> 16:36.670
A word you can't even say.

16:37.633 --> 16:38.471
If you really loved me,

16:38.473 --> 16:40.540
you'd know better than
to ask me to do this.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.275
While wearing another man's ring.

16:42.277 --> 16:43.310
But it's not real.

16:43.312 --> 16:44.477
And this is?

16:44.479 --> 16:46.580
After four years

16:46.582 --> 16:48.949
of hiding every part
of our relationship,

16:48.951 --> 16:52.452
the last thing I want is
to marry you in secret.

16:53.501 --> 16:54.621
As part of a plot.

16:54.623 --> 16:56.890
In a courthouse, no friends, no family,

16:56.892 --> 16:59.192
standing in front of strangers,
standing in front of God

16:59.194 --> 17:00.493
and lying to everyone.

17:00.495 --> 17:02.162
But it would be real.

17:02.164 --> 17:04.164
We'd really be married.

17:05.467 --> 17:06.700
We'd be in love.

17:07.643 --> 17:09.169
We are in love.

17:11.973 --> 17:15.675
I love you, Michael.

17:15.676 --> 17:18.712
Is that what you wanted to hear?

17:18.714 --> 17:20.747
It was.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.750
Yeah.

17:24.848 --> 17:26.419

less from the queen C?

Well, maid of honor duty calls.

- Thanks, I think.

18:55.322 --> 18:57.389
Hasn't been easy.

18:57.391 --> 18:59.424
Yeah, life at the top never is.

18:59.426 --> 19:01.393
Everyone has to make sacrifices.

19:02.562 --> 19:04.062
Ah, why don't you make yourself useful

19:04.064 --> 19:05.063
and go fill 'er up?

19:05.065 --> 19:06.164
Thomas.

19:07.601 --> 19:10.201
Hey, I can help you with that refill.

19:10.203 --> 19:12.904
Grandpa and I have lots to catch up on.

19:12.906 --> 19:14.639
I'm sure you have campaign connections

19:27.254 --> 19:29.714
You hated the
idea of Fallon marrying Jeff.

19:29.823 --> 19:32.624
Aren't you leaving out a couple
of key points here, Cristal?

19:32.626 --> 19:34.659
I don't know what I was thinking

19:34.661 --> 19:37.262
when I asked you to help
me get through to Blake.

19:37.264 --> 19:40.131
I guess I thought: you raised him,

19:40.133 --> 19:42.082
surely you would know the magic word...

19:42.102 --> 19:44.169
As far as the magic word is concerned,

19:44.540 --> 19:46.208
my son is a man of action.

19:46.263 --> 19:47.500
But if you want his attention,

19:47.565 --> 19:49.461
you have to show him that you'll do more

19:49.533 --> 19:54.503
than just whine,
complain and go to spin class.

19:54.505 --> 19:57.305
♪ We could be beautiful. ♪

19:58.148 --> 19:59.174
For being my maid of honor.

19:59.176 --> 20:00.509
You didn't have to do this.

20:00.511 --> 20:01.676
I know.

20:08.787 --> 20:11.019
Our first Halloween together.

20:11.021 --> 20:12.787
You wouldn't leave my side
because I was the only one

20:12.789 --> 20:14.856
willing to explain
your costume to people.

20:14.858 --> 20:16.258
Well, how lame that kids in junior high

20:16.260 --> 20:18.013
didn't know who Ruth Bader Ginsburg was.

20:18.048 --> 20:20.128
- Totally lame.
- But you stayed with me

20:20.130 --> 20:22.764
all night. Right by my side.

20:22.766 --> 20:25.967
And 13 years later, nothing has changed.

20:25.969 --> 20:27.536
You're still right here,

20:27.538 --> 20:29.237
supporting me every step of the way.

20:29.239 --> 20:30.472
You know,

20:30.474 --> 20:33.074
after everything we've been through,

20:33.076 --> 20:37.145
you are the one person I
trust most in this world.

20:39.950 --> 20:41.316
Fallon, I...

20:41.906 --> 20:42.951
What?

20:42.953 --> 20:44.653
Is something wrong?

20:46.857 --> 20:48.823
I'm sorry.

20:48.825 --> 20:50.759
I think this champagne
has gone to my head.

20:50.761 --> 20:52.394
I need to go outside.

20:56.233 --> 20:58.099
♪ ♪

20:58.101 --> 20:59.134
Oh.

20:59.136 --> 21:00.135
Here you go.

21:00.137 --> 21:01.736
- Thanks.
- Here's to blind dates.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.705
So Fallon said you're her... assistant?

21:03.707 --> 21:05.273
Yeah. It's your classic

21:05.275 --> 21:08.009
slacker-boy meets girl-boss story.

21:08.011 --> 21:10.679
Technically,
it's boy fell for girl's brother,

21:10.681 --> 21:12.847
boy's aunt married girl's father,

21:12.849 --> 21:15.016
then girl hired boy even though

21:15.018 --> 21:18.620
he ransacked her house and
ruined Christmas... story.

21:18.622 --> 21:21.356
Right on.
Well, here's to those who wish us well

21:21.358 --> 21:22.891
and all the rest can go to...

21:22.893 --> 21:24.459
Oh, my God, I love that song.

21:24.461 --> 21:27.028
- Is it a song?
- You are so funny. Actually, I forgot

21:27.030 --> 21:29.064
- to ask you, how do you know Fallon?
- Hey.

21:29.066 --> 21:30.365
Who's this?

21:30.367 --> 21:33.901
Oh, you-you must know
Fallon's friend, Liam.

21:33.936 --> 21:35.637
- Don't believe I do.
- She set us up.

21:35.639 --> 21:39.174
'Cause, you know,
I didn't have a plus-one.

21:40.107 --> 21:43.645
Anyway, uh, Liam, this is Steven, my ex.

21:43.647 --> 21:46.181
My ex, this is Liam.

21:46.183 --> 21:47.449
Yeah, I got it.

21:47.451 --> 21:51.286
Well, how awkward is this? Agreed.

21:51.288 --> 21:53.255
Anyway, we'll catch you later.

21:53.257 --> 21:55.123
See you soon, I'm sure.

21:57.160 --> 22:01.963
I see Blake's built himself
quite the castle of lies.

22:01.965 --> 22:03.898
Well, if everything goes right today,

22:04.971 --> 22:07.002
we'll own this castle.

22:12.876 --> 22:14.376
All the Colbys have arrived.

22:14.378 --> 22:16.244
Now get in there and find that server.

22:28.058 --> 22:29.257
Stop.

22:30.160 --> 22:31.159
Stop.

22:31.161 --> 22:32.260
Stop!

22:32.262 --> 22:34.296
Everyone out.

22:40.498 --> 22:41.836
Um...

22:41.838 --> 22:43.338
Anders said you wanted to see me.

22:45.481 --> 22:47.909
I need you to sign something
my lawyers drew up.

22:47.911 --> 22:49.077
But can't it wait till Monday?

22:49.079 --> 22:50.345
The team's inside Colby's house.

22:51.473 --> 22:52.981
Is that all you care about?

22:52.983 --> 22:56.618
Well, yeah, today. Yeah.
Look, we're almost through it.

22:56.620 --> 22:59.454
Geez, I understand, it's,
uh, it's been stressful.

22:59.456 --> 23:03.358
Stressful? I'm exhausted.

23:03.360 --> 23:06.127
I am suffocating,
not even because of this dress,

23:06.129 --> 23:09.064
and all you care about is
keeping your image clean.

23:09.066 --> 23:11.166
Fallon, you need to separate
your feelings from the fiction.

23:11.168 --> 23:12.600
How?

23:12.602 --> 23:14.302
Everyone in the world that I love

23:14.304 --> 23:16.771
is inside this house right now,
except for my mother, of course.

23:16.773 --> 23:18.874
Because you gave up on that marriage

23:18.909 --> 23:21.109
and led me to believe that she
turned her back on all of us.

23:21.111 --> 23:22.811
I wish she was here right now.
Then she could tell you everything,

23:22.880 --> 23:25.613
then maybe you would believe me,
but she's not here right now, I am.

23:25.615 --> 23:26.987
So what do you think that means?

23:27.084 --> 23:29.170
We'll never know,
because you pushed her away.

23:29.205 --> 23:30.552
Just like everyone else in my life.

23:30.554 --> 23:32.420
It's like you're so allergic
to happiness you have

23:32.422 --> 23:34.472
to deny all of us the
experience of ever having it.

23:34.558 --> 23:37.025
What are you talking about?
This isn't real.

23:37.027 --> 23:38.893
This isn't supposed to be a happy day.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.095
But it was.

23:40.097 --> 23:42.130
I was supposed to marry
the man that I loved.

23:42.132 --> 23:44.132
This is the day that every
little girl dreams of,

23:44.134 --> 23:45.600
and you've turned it into a nightmare.

23:45.602 --> 23:46.835
And you don't even care

23:46.837 --> 23:49.070
how much I've sacrificed to save you.

23:49.794 --> 23:50.572
Well...

23:51.533 --> 23:54.476
I don't care that this is all a charade.

23:54.478 --> 23:56.945
I'm sick of it, and I'm sick of you.

23:56.947 --> 23:58.780
I don't want you by my side.

23:58.782 --> 24:00.715
I don't want you walking
me down the aisle.

24:00.717 --> 24:02.550
I'm finishing this alone.

24:04.121 --> 24:06.221
Fallon.

24:06.223 --> 24:07.956
I would never let you marry him.

24:07.958 --> 24:10.492
I'm gonna stop it.
We just need a few more minutes...

24:10.494 --> 24:12.026
Get out!

24:23.724 --> 24:24.472
If you're here to gloat

24:24.474 --> 24:28.443
about how right you were,
just get it over with.

24:28.445 --> 24:30.842
Or if you've come to pay me
back for your wedding day...

24:30.848 --> 24:33.748
I'm here to apologize.

24:33.750 --> 24:37.285
For not doing more to stop this wedding.

24:37.287 --> 24:38.787
Instead of just complaining about it.

24:38.789 --> 24:41.222
Or asking Thomas to take care of it.

24:41.224 --> 24:43.425
I saw you hurting and
I didn't do enough.

24:46.596 --> 24:50.932
Look, Fallon, I know you hate it
when people call me your stepmother,

24:50.934 --> 24:52.233
but that's what I am.

24:52.235 --> 24:56.037
You are my responsibility,
like it or not.

24:56.039 --> 24:58.173
And we are bound together for life...

24:58.175 --> 25:00.875
- We'll see.
- ...by the same man.

25:00.877 --> 25:03.678
We both know what it's
like to love someone

25:03.680 --> 25:05.613
who does bad things.

25:06.762 --> 25:08.950
And how hard that is to reconcile.

25:08.952 --> 25:12.787
Well, I'd like to think he means well.

25:12.789 --> 25:15.723
Sometimes you're just not sure.

25:18.728 --> 25:22.030
Your father used us both.

25:22.032 --> 25:23.998
But men have always used
women for centuries.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.267
So why shouldn't it be our turn now?

25:26.269 --> 25:27.869
I will go out there right now,

25:27.871 --> 25:30.405
and I will call this entire thing off,

25:30.407 --> 25:32.440
if that is what you want me to do.

25:32.442 --> 25:35.677
No.

25:35.679 --> 25:38.847
There is something else I need.

25:45.689 --> 25:47.722
Your whiskey, sir.

25:56.867 --> 25:58.700
Blake.

25:58.702 --> 26:00.869
Cecil.

26:00.871 --> 26:02.403
I'm glad you made it.

26:02.405 --> 26:03.938
For the kids.

26:03.940 --> 26:05.807
And as promised.

26:05.809 --> 26:07.742
Mm.

26:07.744 --> 26:09.144
To family.

26:09.246 --> 26:10.378
To family.

26:10.380 --> 26:12.280
Wait.

26:12.282 --> 26:14.082
I can't have my future father-in-law

26:14.084 --> 26:15.583
drinking anything but the best.

26:16.705 --> 26:17.852
Besides, in the Colby family,

26:17.854 --> 26:21.656
it's tradition that the
groom gives the first toast.

26:22.803 --> 26:24.058
- To good luck.
- Jeff...

26:28.409 --> 26:31.217
- We need to get you to a doctor now.
- I'm not going anywhere.

26:31.270 --> 26:32.970
- We don't have the time for this.
- You're right.

26:33.038 --> 26:35.338
We don't have time for this.

26:36.308 --> 26:38.174
Copy that.

26:38.176 --> 26:41.878
You called me arrogant,
said I always think I know better.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.146
Well, I know you.

26:43.148 --> 26:45.982
When I went to put your pocket
square in your blazer last night,

26:45.984 --> 26:47.884
I found your little science experiment.

26:47.886 --> 26:50.086
Figured you weren't
just feeling nostalgic

26:50.088 --> 26:51.521
for your days in the chem lab.

26:51.523 --> 26:54.958
So I replaced it with water
to teach you a lesson.

26:56.085 --> 26:59.095
Soon as I saw you dose Blake's drink,
I knew I was right.

26:59.097 --> 27:00.230
_

27:00.232 --> 27:03.032
Why are you so hell-bent
on sabotaging my plan?

27:03.034 --> 27:04.200
I was expediting it.

27:04.201 --> 27:06.014
_

27:06.015 --> 27:08.516
_

27:09.074 --> 27:12.575
The moment we do something like that,
we become just like them.

27:12.577 --> 27:13.943
And we're not like them.

27:15.059 --> 27:16.713
I've been looking everywhere for you.

27:16.715 --> 27:18.015
Is everything okay?

27:18.116 --> 27:19.916
Fallon is okay, but I'm not.

27:19.918 --> 27:22.018
I don't think I can do this.

27:23.455 --> 27:24.988
It's about to start.

27:24.990 --> 27:29.259
For years, this family has
been torn apart by one man.

27:29.261 --> 27:32.295
That ends today.

27:33.465 --> 27:36.132
You know,
if 50% of marriages end in divorce,

27:36.134 --> 27:38.701
- that means the other half ends in death.
- Yeah.

27:38.703 --> 27:40.937
Well, that's... that's a little somber.

27:40.939 --> 27:43.406
Sorry. I'm working through some stuff.

27:43.408 --> 27:44.596
Okay.

27:44.677 --> 27:46.927
Why hasn't this charade ended yet?

27:46.979 --> 27:49.813
We're waiting for an
update from the team.

27:49.815 --> 27:51.147
Where's Cristal?

27:54.019 --> 27:55.251
What is your status?

27:55.253 --> 27:56.486
We located the server.

27:56.488 --> 27:59.222
Attempting to bypass
the security system now.

28:01.092 --> 28:02.859
We'll be inside in two minutes.

28:02.861 --> 28:05.261
They're getting closer, sir.

28:05.263 --> 28:07.230
Why don't you have
Cristal and her nephew

28:07.232 --> 28:09.833
put on their little
salsa show while we wait?

28:09.835 --> 28:12.135
What's the holdup, Carrington?

28:12.137 --> 28:13.269
Oh, everything's fine.

28:13.271 --> 28:15.238
Brides.

28:15.240 --> 28:16.773
Fallon's on her way down.

28:22.380 --> 28:24.914
If we stall any longer,
they're gonna get suspicious,

28:24.916 --> 28:26.683
and we can't afford to blow this now.

28:32.190 --> 28:33.823

Dearly beloved,

29:55.640 --> 29:57.340
we are gathered here today

29:57.342 --> 29:59.676
to celebrate the union
of Fallon Carrington...

29:59.678 --> 30:01.878
Gentlemen, an update, please?

30:01.880 --> 30:03.212
We've encountered a delay.

30:04.104 --> 30:06.082
Still attempting a work-around.

30:06.084 --> 30:07.750
We don't have much time.

30:09.359 --> 30:12.055
Marriage is an honorable estate,

30:12.057 --> 30:14.290
not to be entered into lightly,

30:14.292 --> 30:15.658
but reverently

30:15.660 --> 30:17.794
and respectfully.

30:17.796 --> 30:19.495
You can't let this go on any longer.

30:19.497 --> 30:20.563
Fallon will handle it.

30:20.565 --> 30:22.332
We have to take care
of that server first,

30:22.334 --> 30:23.633
or all of this is for nothing.

30:26.848 --> 30:28.930
If anyone here can show just cause

30:28.940 --> 30:31.407
why this couple should not
be lawfully joined together,

30:31.409 --> 30:33.009
then speak now,

30:33.011 --> 30:36.980
or forever hold their peace.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.721
We're in. Ten minutes
to degauss, and we're out.

30:52.931 --> 30:54.297
Stop!

30:56.267 --> 30:58.067
I'm sorry.
