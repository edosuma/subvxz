<i>Previously on Bates Motel...</i>

00:02.118 --> 00:03.651
How do you expect me to
have a relationship with you

00:03.652 --> 00:05.271
under the circumstances?

00:05.272 --> 00:07.217
Norman never has to know I'm here.

00:07.218 --> 00:08.911
(Romero) A dead girl was found floating

00:08.912 --> 00:10.829
in the tidal flats early this morning.

00:10.830 --> 00:12.047
I'm wondering if you're missing anyone

00:12.048 --> 00:13.415
from, uh, your little party.

00:13.416 --> 00:16.163
Oh, Emma, this is Annika, room 4.

00:16.164 --> 00:17.498
Nice to meet you.

00:17.499 --> 00:18.782
Have you seen the girl in number 4 today?

00:18.783 --> 00:20.167
(Emma) I saw her car here.

00:20.168 --> 00:21.618
When is the last time you saw her?

00:21.619 --> 00:24.338
Last night. She was
going somewhere in town.

00:24.339 --> 00:26.290
Norman drove with her
to show her where it was.

00:26.291 --> 00:27.674
Norman went with her?

00:27.675 --> 00:29.343
You're treating me like I killed this girl.

00:29.344 --> 00:30.627
Just make up your mind!

00:30.628 --> 00:32.628
I did not kill Annika!

00:32.630 --> 00:34.348
I don't think that you
killed anyone, Norman.

00:34.349 --> 00:35.933
Don't lie to me!

00:35.934 --> 00:38.468
Norman, answer me right now!

- [screaming]
- [gasps]

00:39.804 --> 00:40.888
(Norma) Annika?

00:40.889 --> 00:41.889
Are you okay?

00:41.890 --> 00:43.140
Oh... oh, God.

00:43.141 --> 00:44.525
Use it.

00:44.526 --> 00:46.610
Do something with it. It's important.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.812
(woman) 911, what is your emergency?

00:48.813 --> 00:51.481
I'm at the Bates Motel, Highway 88.

00:51.482 --> 00:54.367
Please send someone. I think she's dead.

01:54.272 --> 01:55.523
Where's Norma Bates?

01:55.524 --> 01:57.524
She's in the office with the paramedics.

02:00.145 --> 02:01.278
[device pumping] I'm fine.

02:01.279 --> 02:02.730
You don't need to do that.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.565
You passed out.

02:04.566 --> 02:06.783
Well, a girl just died on
me, but I'm... I'm fine.

02:09.070 --> 02:11.739
[device hissing]

02:11.740 --> 02:13.791
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

02:13.792 --> 02:15.459
Norman wasn't anywhere near her.

02:15.460 --> 02:17.661
- He was up in bed sleeping.
- Okay, okay, Norma.

02:17.662 --> 02:22.216
Just leave him alone.
He's not feeling very well.

02:22.217 --> 02:25.753
He doesn't need to see any of this.

02:25.754 --> 02:28.172
- Norman, Norman.
- Did I do it?

02:28.173 --> 02:29.473
Oh, shh.

02:29.474 --> 02:31.308
- It's okay.
- Did I do it?

02:31.309 --> 02:33.394
- Don't talk.
- Did I do it?

02:33.395 --> 02:35.846
It's okay. Listen...

02:35.847 --> 02:38.482
I need you to take a big
breath right now, okay?

02:38.483 --> 02:41.397
- Did I do it?
- Look at me.

02:41.398 --> 02:44.521
Annika drove here after
she'd already been shot.

02:44.522 --> 02:46.156
Okay, I need you to calm down.

02:46.157 --> 02:48.492
Step outside your body. Be calm.

02:48.493 --> 02:50.661
Look at me. You have control over this.

02:50.662 --> 02:52.446
Okay, everything is fine.
You didn't do anything.

02:52.447 --> 02:54.415
I just need you to stay calm.
Go back inside the house.

02:54.416 --> 02:56.333
There are a lot of police here.
They're not going to understand.

02:56.334 --> 02:57.701
What the hell?

02:57.702 --> 02:59.503
Dylan, thank God. Thank God you're here.

02:59.504 --> 03:00.671
You've got to help me.

03:00.672 --> 03:02.122
We need to take him in the house.

03:02.123 --> 03:03.374
He is very upset.

03:03.375 --> 03:04.592
I don't want him to see any of this.

03:04.593 --> 03:06.093
Please take him in the house.

03:06.094 --> 03:08.379
Did I do it? Did I do it?

03:31.679 --> 03:33.764
I was in the office closing up,

03:33.765 --> 03:35.799
and this car comes careening in.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.267
Annika gets out of it.

03:37.268 --> 03:40.937
She staggers over to me, falls in my arms.

03:40.938 --> 03:43.473
I realize that she has been shot,

03:43.474 --> 03:44.891
so I call 911,

03:44.892 --> 03:48.561
and she dies before they arrive.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.949
I know, it's crazy.

03:52.950 --> 03:56.286
It doesn't make any sense.

03:56.287 --> 03:58.238
You've never seen that car before?

03:58.239 --> 03:59.956
Uh, no, no. You towed the car.

03:59.957 --> 04:01.741
I don't know what that car was.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.577
Can I possibly get out of these clothes?

04:03.578 --> 04:06.463
What was wrong with Norman
when he came down to the motel?

04:06.464 --> 04:09.749
Wrong with him?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.384
You mean the fact that he had

04:11.385 --> 04:13.253
a compassionate human reaction

04:13.254 --> 04:15.171
to one of our guests dying in our driveway?

04:18.759 --> 04:20.894
You don't get to do this.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.647
- Do what?
- Sit here in my house

04:23.648 --> 04:25.682
and suspect me and/or Norman

04:25.683 --> 04:28.350
and say stuff like that,
not after everything.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.441
Okay, I've told you all I know.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.776
Do you not believe me?

04:36.777 --> 04:40.947
Is there something else
that you're looking for?

04:40.948 --> 04:44.751
Chaos seems to swirl around
you, and I'm not sure why.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.253
And I want to believe

04:46.254 --> 04:47.621
you're telling me everything you know,

04:47.622 --> 04:48.955
but none of this makes any sense.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.925
Why would this girl, after she's been shot,

04:51.926 --> 04:53.627
make the effort to drive here?

04:53.628 --> 04:55.294
Why?

05:02.553 --> 05:04.888
I-I don't know.

05:04.889 --> 05:05.889
I...

05:05.890 --> 05:09.609
Maybe because it was close.

05:09.610 --> 05:12.646
Maybe she just wanted to get to someone

05:12.647 --> 05:15.281
who could help her get to a hospital.

05:16.901 --> 05:18.617
That's all I know.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.492
I'm gonna go check on Norman, okay?

05:25.493 --> 05:27.459
You can show yourself out.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.676
What happened to him?

05:42.677 --> 05:43.927
He had a bad episode.

05:43.928 --> 05:47.313
I found him in the tub under the water.

05:52.570 --> 05:56.273
Is she really dead?

05:56.274 --> 05:57.691
Do you remember anything that happened

05:57.692 --> 06:00.527
when you were having a bath?

06:00.528 --> 06:02.278
I think you blacked out again.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.539
Um...

06:12.540 --> 06:14.874
I'm, um... I'm, um...

06:14.875 --> 06:17.844
get out of these clothes.
I want you to rest, okay?

06:17.845 --> 06:20.463
I'll come back to check up on you, okay?

06:20.464 --> 06:23.216
I blacked out, and then she was dead?

06:23.217 --> 06:25.635
Norman, you had nothing to do with this.

06:25.636 --> 06:27.854
You were nowhere near her when it happened.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.222
I'll stay with him.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.893
Thank you, Dylan.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.562
I don't know what I would do without you.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.280
I just feel so alone in all this.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.359
(Norma) Hi, honey.

07:56.360 --> 07:57.861
You want some bacon?

07:57.862 --> 08:00.397
Sure.

08:00.398 --> 08:02.866
Why do you think Annika came back?

08:02.867 --> 08:05.402
Do you think maybe she was
coming back here to talk to me?

08:05.403 --> 08:09.205
I mean, I'm really the only
person she ever talked to here.

08:09.206 --> 08:10.907
Well, it's not like I never spoke to her.

08:10.908 --> 08:13.542
No, but I mean about anything important.

08:18.249 --> 08:20.333
What did you talk to her about?

08:20.334 --> 08:22.752
I think I talked to her a little bit

08:22.753 --> 08:25.255
about what a good mother you were,

08:25.256 --> 08:28.224
about how hard you were trying,

08:28.225 --> 08:31.511
how tough it had been for
you since you moved here...

08:31.512 --> 08:33.761
and talked to her about how close we were.

08:39.570 --> 08:41.354
Do you still like me?

08:41.355 --> 08:44.273
[gentle music]

08:51.499 --> 08:55.335
What kind of a silly question is that?

08:55.336 --> 08:57.537
You just seem...

08:57.538 --> 08:59.873
different as of late,

08:59.874 --> 09:04.427
maybe because Dylan lives here now.

09:04.428 --> 09:07.213
Things have changed between the two of you

09:07.214 --> 09:08.381
and between us.

09:08.382 --> 09:11.717
It's... it's different.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.724
No, Norman, I don't think
anything is different

09:17.725 --> 09:19.641
or ever will be.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.613
Okay.

09:57.141 --> 09:59.225
Excuse me.

10:03.031 --> 10:04.982
Sorry.

10:04.983 --> 10:06.198
Cou... do you mind?

10:08.453 --> 10:10.287
Sorry. You look like you really know

10:10.288 --> 10:11.655
what you're doing on that,

10:11.656 --> 10:13.490
and maybe you won't
know the answer to this,

10:13.491 --> 10:14.992
but my mother just died,

10:14.993 --> 10:17.995
and she had all her tax files on this.

10:17.996 --> 10:19.546
And I have to deal with her estate,

10:19.547 --> 10:21.164
and there are financial issues,

10:21.165 --> 10:22.466
and she wasn't very sound near the end,

10:22.467 --> 10:24.217
and she changed all her passwords.

10:24.218 --> 10:25.551
Yeah, okay.

10:27.672 --> 10:30.172
Okay.

10:34.262 --> 10:37.014

10:45.356 --> 10:48.025
Your mom did this?

10:48.026 --> 10:51.243
Yep.

10:51.646 --> 10:53.814
This is actually a really good program.

10:53.815 --> 10:57.233
I can't override it. You need a password.

10:59.487 --> 11:01.822
Okay.

11:01.823 --> 11:03.823
Thanks. That's helpful.

11:07.796 --> 11:09.330
- Sheriff?
- Yeah.

11:09.331 --> 11:12.499
Got a couple updates on
the Annika Johnson murder.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.500
Yeah, what?

11:13.501 --> 11:14.918
Coroner estimates she was shot

11:14.919 --> 11:18.305
about 20 minutes before
she got to the Bates Motel.

11:18.306 --> 11:20.891
She could have driven from
almost anyplace in town.

11:20.892 --> 11:24.511
Also, the car Annika Johnson
drove to the motel last night,

11:24.512 --> 11:25.846
it's registered to the girl

11:25.847 --> 11:27.681

- No problem.

11:40.362 --> 11:42.196
You finally agreed to come into town.

11:42.197 --> 11:44.698
Yeah, of course.

11:44.699 --> 11:46.667
So how long you sticking around for?

11:46.668 --> 11:47.785
Not really sure, you know?

11:47.786 --> 11:49.003
Depends on the barn.

11:49.004 --> 11:50.337
The weather might slow us down.

11:50.338 --> 11:51.622
Oh, yeah, that's right.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.540
I didn't think about that.

11:53.541 --> 11:56.760
If it was just me and Dylan,
we'd be up shit's creek.

12:23.238 --> 12:24.955
Yeah.

12:24.956 --> 12:26.373

12:26.374 --> 12:27.624
Let's go.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.709
[engine turning over]

12:31.246 --> 12:32.413
(Emma) I'd feel totally prepared

12:32.414 --> 12:34.498
if this was just multiple choice,

12:34.499 --> 12:38.585
but I know there's gonna
be an essay section.

12:38.586 --> 12:40.254
"Talk about the Stamp Act

12:40.255 --> 12:43.473
and how it relates to a
current political issue."

12:47.645 --> 12:50.264
Norman.

12:50.265 --> 12:52.983
Are you thinking about Annika?

12:52.984 --> 12:54.651
No, I... No, I wasn't.

12:54.652 --> 12:57.488
It's all very sad...

12:57.489 --> 12:59.406
and not good for business.

12:59.407 --> 13:01.275
You know, we've had no guests for days.

13:01.276 --> 13:03.277
I'm just worried.

13:03.278 --> 13:04.862
Maybe we should take a day off.

13:04.863 --> 13:06.530
Isn't that every day lately?

13:06.531 --> 13:08.365
I mean away from here.

13:08.366 --> 13:11.168
Go on a picnic or a hike or something,

13:11.169 --> 13:12.786
remember what the world is like.

13:12.787 --> 13:14.420
I think I'd like that.

[sighs]

13:29.554 --> 13:33.307
[clears throat]

13:33.308 --> 13:36.527
I hope you guys aren't doing
that down in the office.

13:36.528 --> 13:39.780
Of course not. I'm sorry, Norma.

13:39.781 --> 13:42.615
Hey, this is my house.

That girl that was missing, she's dead.

14:15.827 --> 14:18.044
She was shot late last night,
and I know she was here.

14:18.045 --> 14:19.830
Do you want to take a look?

14:19.831 --> 14:21.581
You're not gonna find anything.

14:21.582 --> 14:23.166
I think you and I should be talking

14:23.167 --> 14:24.835
in a more formal setting,
like an interrogation.

14:24.836 --> 14:26.086
I've got two dead girls

14:26.087 --> 14:28.588
in two days, both with links to your club.

14:28.589 --> 14:30.056
You don't have two dead girls.

14:30.057 --> 14:31.675
You have two dead hookers.

14:31.676 --> 14:33.260
And this is the town's club.

14:33.261 --> 14:34.895
I'm just the elected president,

14:34.896 --> 14:37.063
just a wonderful,
historical little tradition

14:37.064 --> 14:39.015
in our beloved White Pine Bay

14:39.016 --> 14:41.016
set up by our founding fathers.

14:43.905 --> 14:46.022
Tell me something, Alex,
this missing girl...

14:46.023 --> 14:48.024
Did she have anything on her?

14:48.025 --> 14:49.525
Such as?

14:51.612 --> 14:52.946
I'll take that as a no.

14:52.947 --> 14:54.915
That's a pretty
incriminating question, Bob.

14:54.916 --> 14:56.700
Don't jump to conclusions.

14:56.701 --> 14:59.585
You're a little out of the loop these days.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.548
I never took you for a computer nerd.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.750
Oh, hi.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.919
[chuckles] Well, I...

15:20.920 --> 15:22.754
I-I'm not, really.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.508
I'm just... I'm just looking
at stuff, killing time.

15:26.509 --> 15:29.644
In the computer-code section.

15:29.645 --> 15:32.861
You just get more and more interesting.

15:32.862 --> 15:35.313
I... [mumbles]

15:35.314 --> 15:38.066
The truth is, I'm... yeah. I'm just...

15:38.067 --> 15:41.152
I want to know what my son's
been doing on the computer.

15:41.153 --> 15:43.321
You know, you read these parent magazines

15:43.322 --> 15:46.825
that say you should monitor, and I don't.

15:46.826 --> 15:49.995
I-I-I guess I've
always trusted him.

15:49.996 --> 15:53.130
And you have some reason to
think you shouldn't lately?

15:55.001 --> 15:57.002
Young men can be confusing.

15:57.003 --> 15:59.336
So can everybody.

16:02.842 --> 16:04.976
What time's your next class?

16:04.977 --> 16:07.261
You want to grab a coffee?

16:08.347 --> 16:10.348
Yeah, I have a little time.

16:10.349 --> 16:12.817
Great.

16:12.818 --> 16:14.686
My son and I have always been really close,

16:14.687 --> 16:17.355
like, probably too close.

16:17.356 --> 16:20.825
But we went through a lot together.

16:20.826 --> 16:24.913
Norman and I always had each other.

16:24.914 --> 16:29.199
But things just seem different now.

16:31.037 --> 16:32.369
Different how?

16:34.924 --> 16:38.426
I guess, um, I...

16:38.427 --> 16:41.713
I just don't trust him that much anymore.

16:41.714 --> 16:46.050
And, um, that makes me feel really lonely.

16:50.056 --> 16:52.724
[crying]

16:52.725 --> 16:54.275
This is stupid.

16:54.276 --> 16:56.227
I-I better get to class.

16:56.228 --> 16:58.229
Uh... [chuckles]

16:58.230 --> 17:00.065
It's not stupid.

17:00.066 --> 17:01.733
Imagine what the world would be like

17:01.734 --> 17:05.369
if we could all just be
honest about feeling hurt.

17:05.371 --> 17:08.406
Instead, we've made it this big deal,

17:08.406 --> 17:11.576
feeling anything in public.

17:11.577 --> 17:14.412
What's so bad about that?

17:14.413 --> 17:18.249
Maybe because we'd go
around crying all day.

17:18.250 --> 17:21.085
[both laughing]

17:28.227 --> 17:30.427
[bus drives off in distance]

17:39.772 --> 17:42.823
[mysterious music]

18:03.623 --> 18:05.991
Alex?

18:05.992 --> 18:07.543
What are you doing?

18:07.544 --> 18:09.462
You're not gonna make me
go get a warrant, are you?

18:09.463 --> 18:11.380
No, but I'd like to know
what you're looking for.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.916
I'm looking for answers.

18:13.917 --> 18:15.633
Well, have at it.

18:19.423 --> 18:21.172
Norma...

18:24.010 --> 18:25.428
Did Annika Johnson have anything on her

18:25.429 --> 18:26.645
when she died?

18:26.646 --> 18:28.431
- Clothes.
- Don't be a smart-ass.

18:28.432 --> 18:30.015
I'm not being a smart-ass.

18:30.016 --> 18:31.434
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:31.435 --> 18:33.269
Did she seem like she was
trying to get to her room

18:33.270 --> 18:35.404
to get something?

18:35.405 --> 18:36.938
Maybe.

18:39.276 --> 18:41.110
I... I don't know. It was
hard to tell, you know.

18:41.111 --> 18:43.112
She was weaving, and then she fell into me.

18:43.113 --> 18:44.663
Well, where was she headed?

18:44.664 --> 18:47.031
Like you said, I think she
was heading for her room.

18:49.953 --> 18:52.254
Okay, well, I'm gonna go make dinner.

18:52.255 --> 18:53.255
Norma...

18:53.256 --> 18:54.957
- Norma!
- What?

18:54.958 --> 18:57.126
- Why are you lying to me?
- I'm not.

18:57.127 --> 18:58.961
- Why are you lying to me?
- About what?

18:58.962 --> 19:02.214
About what you're doing here.

19:02.215 --> 19:04.016
I'm not lying.

19:04.017 --> 19:06.135
I'm not revealing the whole truth.

19:06.136 --> 19:07.303
That's my job...

19:07.304 --> 19:11.307
To decide what and when to tell whom.

19:11.308 --> 19:14.143
Well, you're very good at it.

19:14.144 --> 19:16.394
Gold star, Sheriff.

19:28.325 --> 19:30.075
You're making dinner?

19:30.076 --> 19:31.460
No, I'm making some food

19:31.461 --> 19:33.212
to bring on a picnic tomorrow.

19:33.213 --> 19:36.081
Aw, I'd love to go on a
picnic with you tomorrow,

19:36.082 --> 19:37.333
but I've got class.

19:37.334 --> 19:41.002
Not you and me. Emma and I are going.

19:50.180 --> 19:53.065
[dishes banging]

19:53.066 --> 19:55.351
- Something wrong?
- Just stop it, Norman.

19:55.352 --> 19:57.520
Stop what?

19:57.521 --> 19:59.488
[sighs]

19:59.489 --> 20:01.489
Do we have Dijon mustard?

20:07.497 --> 20:09.532
- [fridge door slams, jar bangs]
- Thanks.

20:09.533 --> 20:11.500
I really don't know why you're so upset.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.619
Because, Norman, what you're
doing is wrong and it's stupid.

20:13.620 --> 20:15.287
Oh, really?

20:15.288 --> 20:17.089
Yeah, and it's not what you're thinking.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.674
I don't care if you go on
1,000 picnics with Emma.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.042
You better not be using that girl.

20:20.043 --> 20:21.377
Why would I be using her?

20:21.378 --> 20:22.461
Using her for what?

20:22.462 --> 20:24.046
(Norma) To get back at me.

20:24.047 --> 20:25.548
Or...

20:25.549 --> 20:27.099
because you're annoyed

20:27.100 --> 20:29.101
because you think I like
Dylan better than you

20:29.102 --> 20:31.053
or some childish nonsense
that's in your head.

20:31.054 --> 20:33.105
Oh, so it's all about you.

20:33.106 --> 20:35.307
It's not possible that I
just want to spend a day alone

20:35.308 --> 20:38.143
with this beautiful, intelligent,

20:38.144 --> 20:39.695
sexy young woman

20:39.696 --> 20:43.649
who has feelings for me?

20:43.650 --> 20:47.570
You know you can't sleep with her, right?

20:47.571 --> 20:49.538
It's not really any of
your business, is it?

20:49.539 --> 20:51.407
[laughing] Oh, it is my business,

20:51.408 --> 20:54.660
because you aren't thinking
with your head right now.

20:54.661 --> 20:57.079
Whatever the reason you're
going on this romantic outing,

20:57.080 --> 20:58.581
you can't sleep with her.

20:58.582 --> 21:00.165
She's ill, Norman.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.584
You think she can have
sex just like anyone?

21:01.585 --> 21:04.253
You could kill her,
Norman. You hurt that girl,

21:04.254 --> 21:08.507
I will kick your ass to the moon and back.

21:08.508 --> 21:10.592
You cannot sleep with her.

21:13.179 --> 21:15.513
You don't need to explain that to me.

21:19.152 --> 21:22.154
[insects chirping]

21:22.155 --> 21:23.689
[knock at door]

21:23.690 --> 21:24.989
Yeah.

21:26.693 --> 21:29.495
Can I talk to you for a minute?

21:29.496 --> 21:31.329
Yeah, sure, Norma.

21:33.283 --> 21:35.284
[door closes]

21:35.285 --> 21:37.336
What's up?

21:37.337 --> 21:38.704
When Annika died last night,

21:38.705 --> 21:41.289
before she died, she gave me something.

21:44.010 --> 21:45.711
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

21:45.712 --> 21:48.130
It's locked.

21:48.131 --> 21:49.515
Did you tell Romero?

21:49.516 --> 21:51.300
No, I haven't told anyone.

21:51.301 --> 21:54.553
Not even Norman. I don't trust anyone.

21:54.554 --> 21:56.104
I'm telling you.

21:58.997 --> 22:00.497
Okay.

22:00.498 --> 22:01.832
What makes you think it was for you?

22:01.833 --> 22:04.001
Because she pressed it into my hand,

22:04.002 --> 22:06.303
and she said, "Do something with it.

22:06.304 --> 22:07.721
"Use it. It's important.

22:07.722 --> 22:10.757
Use it for you and your son."

22:10.758 --> 22:13.343
- Sh... she knew Norman?
- You know how Norman is.

22:13.344 --> 22:15.395
Nutty women seem to open up to him.

22:15.396 --> 22:16.646
I don't know what to do with it.

22:16.647 --> 22:18.315
I think Romero's looking for it,

22:18.316 --> 22:19.733
because he was here this
afternoon searching her room,

22:19.734 --> 22:23.020
and he asked me if I'd found anything.

22:23.021 --> 22:25.822
I can't open it.

22:25.823 --> 22:29.026
Maybe you could try.

22:29.027 --> 22:33.363
- Sure, Norma.
- Okay, thanks, sweetie.

22:33.364 --> 22:35.665
Just give it back to me when you're done.

22:35.666 --> 22:37.834
- Norma.
- What?

22:37.835 --> 22:39.703
Don't tell anyone else.

22:39.704 --> 22:42.039
This could be really dangerous.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.757
(Norma) I know, I know.

22:43.758 --> 22:45.959
That's why I don't want Norman to know.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.210
Good night, Dylan.

22:56.337 --> 22:59.338
[door closes]

23:02.432 --> 23:03.899
[Emma laughs]

23:03.900 --> 23:05.484
What?

23:05.485 --> 23:09.187
There's nothing more
romantic than hypothermia.

23:09.188 --> 23:12.524
I... maybe we picked the
wrong day for a picnic.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.359
It's never the wrong day for a picnic.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.912
[laughs] I'm not... I'm not giving up.

23:16.913 --> 23:18.362
Okay.

23:22.702 --> 23:25.754
Hey, come on, maybe we can duck in there

23:25.755 --> 23:28.256
and warm up a bit.

23:28.257 --> 23:30.208
What if someone lives in there?

23:30.209 --> 23:32.210
It doesn't look like it.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.545
We'll find out, at any rate.

23:39.268 --> 23:41.269
[Emma grunting, clears throat]

23:41.270 --> 23:44.221
[coughing]

23:46.275 --> 23:47.692
- You okay?
- Yeah.

23:47.693 --> 23:49.360
[grunts]

23:51.564 --> 23:53.481
- Good?
- Yeah.

23:57.703 --> 24:00.288
Oh, this is fantastic.

24:00.289 --> 24:02.657
It's a bit warmer in here.

24:02.658 --> 24:05.460
But we can build a fire.
Then it'll be perfect.

24:05.461 --> 24:07.295
What if it's smoky?

24:07.296 --> 24:11.249
Is that okay for your lungs?

24:11.250 --> 24:13.919
Yeah, it should be fine.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.753
Go close the window.

24:19.795 --> 24:22.597
So you were friends
with Lindsay and Annika?

24:22.598 --> 24:24.932
Yeah.

24:24.933 --> 24:26.434
I mean, not best friends,

24:26.435 --> 24:27.935
but I've seen them the last few years

24:27.936 --> 24:29.470
at those parties.

24:29.471 --> 24:31.439
The Arcanum Club?

24:31.440 --> 24:33.975
- So you know Bob Paris?
- Yeah.

24:33.976 --> 24:37.528
Did you know that Annika
and Lindsay are dead?

24:37.529 --> 24:40.732
- What?
- They were both murdered.

24:40.733 --> 24:42.483
Did you have any contact
with either of them

24:42.484 --> 24:46.320
since you saw them last year?

24:46.321 --> 24:47.989
Lindsay was seeing Bob Paris.

24:47.990 --> 24:50.658
Seeing, as in they had a relationship?

24:50.659 --> 24:51.959
He took a liking to her.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.795
He started flying her up every weekend.

24:53.796 --> 24:56.330
She was making a lot of money.

24:56.331 --> 24:57.749
And one time she asked me

24:57.750 --> 24:59.417
if I would have a
three-way with her and him.

24:59.418 --> 25:01.552
But I couldn't.

25:01.553 --> 25:04.422
It was my sister's birthday that weekend.

25:04.423 --> 25:05.757
Do you have any reason to believe

25:05.758 --> 25:07.508
that Bob Paris would want her dead?

25:07.509 --> 25:10.060
Maybe... maybe she knew too much?

25:11.897 --> 25:13.848
I honestly doubt that guy gives a damn

25:13.849 --> 25:18.736
who knows what about his sex habits.

25:18.737 --> 25:21.906
But I think Lindsay started to get a taste

25:21.907 --> 25:24.075
for a lifestyle she couldn't afford.

25:24.076 --> 25:26.410
She started resenting him.

25:26.411 --> 25:29.746
Maybe she had feelings for
him that weren't reciprocated.

25:31.750 --> 25:34.919
I just got the feeling she was pissed.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.504
Just out of curiosity,

25:36.505 --> 25:38.371
you know who took your
place in that three-way?

25:42.127 --> 25:45.378
I'm pretty sure she said
Annika Johnson stepped in.

25:47.883 --> 25:51.602
You warm enough?

25:51.603 --> 25:53.554
I am.

25:53.555 --> 25:55.973
Brought enough oxygen?

25:55.974 --> 25:57.892
Yes, of course.

25:57.893 --> 25:59.777
[pop music playing]

25:59.778 --> 26:02.396
Do your lungs hurt when you can't breathe?

26:02.397 --> 26:06.567
More of a-a panicky feeling than a pain,

26:06.568 --> 26:09.620
like someone's holding you underwater.

26:09.621 --> 26:12.573
- Well, that doesn't sound good.
- I'm not worried.

26:12.574 --> 26:13.991
I'm... I'm happy.

26:13.992 --> 26:15.660
When you're happy, you feel immortal.

26:15.661 --> 26:16.911
But nonetheless, you aren't.

26:16.912 --> 26:19.796
I mean, no matter what you feel like...

26:21.884 --> 26:24.418
I'm not thinking about that today.

26:24.419 --> 26:26.921
Today I'm living.

26:26.922 --> 26:29.472
Get on board, Bates.

26:48.443 --> 26:50.444
I think we should stop.

26:50.445 --> 26:52.663
I don't want to hurt you.

26:52.664 --> 26:54.364
What is with you?

26:58.704 --> 27:01.756
My mother says that I
shouldn't have sex with you,

27:01.757 --> 27:04.792
that you shouldn't have sex.

27:04.793 --> 27:06.593
It could kill you.

27:08.660 --> 27:11.195
- What's wrong?
- Are you joking?

27:11.196 --> 27:13.197
That is totally insulting.

27:13.198 --> 27:15.866
I have lived with this illness
every day of my life, 24-7.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.785
I think I know my own limitations.

27:17.786 --> 27:19.753
I think I've earned the right
to make my own decisions,

27:19.754 --> 27:21.205
not take direction from two people

27:21.206 --> 27:22.957
who wouldn't know their ass from a handbag

27:22.958 --> 27:24.624
if they had a head cold.

27:29.598 --> 27:30.848
I didn't think your mother

27:30.849 --> 27:33.049
was coming on this date with us.

27:35.637 --> 27:38.222
[door slams]

27:38.223 --> 27:41.224
[vehicle approaching]

27:58.910 --> 28:00.578
Did you go to town?

28:00.579 --> 28:02.713
Gunner says you went with him.

28:02.714 --> 28:05.999
Gunner couldn't haul that
thing up here by himself.

28:08.837 --> 28:10.221
Could you stop that for a sec?

28:10.222 --> 28:11.589
What do you want from me?

28:11.590 --> 28:14.008
It was a two-man job. You weren't here.

28:14.009 --> 28:15.226
What if Norma had seen you?

28:15.227 --> 28:17.011
Look, what if she had, okay?

28:17.012 --> 28:20.097
I'm a human being. Is that a crime?

28:20.098 --> 28:21.849
She's the one who won't talk to me.

28:21.850 --> 28:23.317
She's the one being irrational.

28:23.318 --> 28:24.935
I don't think it's irrational

28:24.936 --> 28:26.604
to not want to talk to
the guy who raped her.

28:26.605 --> 28:28.772
Look, you don't understand, Dylan.

28:28.773 --> 28:31.108
You never will!

28:31.109 --> 28:32.776
I'm helping you out.

28:32.777 --> 28:34.278
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but you need me out here.

28:34.279 --> 28:35.779
You don't know what you're doing.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.114
I think I do.

28:37.115 --> 28:38.782
If I didn't come out here and come along,

28:38.783 --> 28:40.284
you'd have been standing in
a pile of collapsed lumber!

28:40.285 --> 28:42.253
No one asked you to come here, okay?

28:42.254 --> 28:43.621
No one's making you do this.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.506
Then why don't you tell me to leave?

28:45.507 --> 28:46.789
Tell me to leave!

28:51.012 --> 28:52.630
Caleb. Caleb.

28:52.631 --> 28:53.930
Caleb.

28:56.134 --> 28:57.601
Caleb.

28:57.602 --> 29:00.771
Rela... relax. I'm fine.

29:00.772 --> 29:03.307
[grunts] I'm fine.

29:03.308 --> 29:04.775
- I'm fine.
- You're fine?

29:04.776 --> 29:06.142
Yeah.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.146
You're bleeding.

29:09.147 --> 29:11.065
We need to get you to a hospital, man.

29:11.066 --> 29:12.950
No, no, no, no, no.

29:12.951 --> 29:13.951
You need stitches.

29:13.952 --> 29:15.236
- No hospital.
- Why?

29:15.237 --> 29:17.238
I can't. I...

29:17.239 --> 29:19.907
I got a warrant. [sniffs]

29:19.908 --> 29:22.910
You're wanted?

29:22.911 --> 29:25.045
Come on, we need to get you sewn up, man.

29:25.046 --> 29:26.664
You're bleeding like shit.

29:26.665 --> 29:29.250
Please, no hospital.

29:29.251 --> 29:30.718
- Please.
- I'm not.

29:30.719 --> 29:32.002
I'm gonna do it.

29:32.003 --> 29:33.671
Come on.

29:33.672 --> 29:35.306
Come on. [grunts]

29:35.307 --> 29:37.507
Come on, let's go.

29:47.736 --> 29:49.353
You ready?

29:49.354 --> 29:51.020
Just do it.

29:54.326 --> 29:57.994
[winces, groans]

30:19.184 --> 30:23.603
Was it really like she said it was?

30:28.193 --> 30:31.361
Yeah, it was.

30:33.281 --> 30:36.734
Maybe not exactly.

30:36.735 --> 30:39.820
I mean, we're so close, her and me.

30:39.821 --> 30:42.206
We were all we had.

30:42.207 --> 30:46.293
We were like two kids raising ourselves.

30:46.294 --> 30:48.662
[pensive music]

30:48.663 --> 30:51.547
So we spent all of our time together.

30:53.835 --> 30:56.219
It just happened.

31:00.141 --> 31:04.845
You know, she was more than a sister to me.

31:04.846 --> 31:07.264
I mean, she was my whole world,

31:07.265 --> 31:09.316
my whole life.

31:09.317 --> 31:11.317
I mean, I loved her.

31:13.655 --> 31:17.191
You can't help who you love.

31:17.192 --> 31:19.193
But your mom...

31:19.194 --> 31:21.362
she was smarter than me, you know.

31:21.363 --> 31:23.280
She... she figured shit out.

31:23.281 --> 31:27.918
One day she came home and said it was bad,

31:27.919 --> 31:31.754
you know, that we couldn't anymore.

31:33.708 --> 31:36.293
And the way she looked at me,

31:36.294 --> 31:39.680
I couldn't breathe.

31:39.681 --> 31:43.300
You know, I loved her more
than anything, and I just...

31:43.301 --> 31:46.135
[stifled cry] I just couldn't let her go.

31:49.724 --> 31:52.559
I hate myself for it.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.561
I know I don't deserve it,

31:54.562 --> 31:58.314
but I wish I could say I'm sorry.

31:59.984 --> 32:02.034
That's all I want.

32:05.039 --> 32:06.907
She doesn't have to forgive me.

32:06.908 --> 32:10.577
I just want to tell her I'm sorry...

32:10.578 --> 32:13.713
before I never have another chance.

33:34.288 --> 33:36.373
There's something here that belongs to us.

33:36.374 --> 33:38.375
Put your hands out in front of you.

33:38.376 --> 33:41.795
Easy.

33:41.796 --> 33:43.046
Don't start something

33:43.047 --> 33:45.047
you're not gonna be able to finish.

33:46.884 --> 33:48.884
[gun cocks]

33:52.273 --> 33:54.691
He pops me...

33:54.692 --> 33:57.727
I still get the shot off.

33:57.728 --> 34:00.397
(Dylan) You're dead.

34:00.398 --> 34:02.983
I'm done.

34:02.984 --> 34:04.503
We're leaving.

34:04.504 --> 34:07.372
That house up there...

34:07.373 --> 34:09.625
Looks like a lot of rooms,

34:09.626 --> 34:12.844
good places to hide things...

34:12.846 --> 34:15.714
front and back entrance.

34:15.715 --> 34:18.550
Here's a fact.

34:18.551 --> 34:22.521
If I see either one of
you here ever again...

34:22.522 --> 34:24.889
I'll kill you.

34:24.891 --> 34:27.059
Okay.

34:27.060 --> 34:30.478
But you're not always here.

34:41.708 --> 34:43.542
[computer beeps]

34:43.543 --> 34:45.878
[door closes]

34:45.879 --> 34:48.880
[footsteps approaching]

34:53.139 --> 34:55.975
Norma, some guy was just
searching the office.

34:55.976 --> 34:57.760
He said that we had
something that wasn't ours.

34:57.761 --> 34:59.011
What? Now?

34:59.012 --> 35:00.846
We need to get rid of that flash drive.

35:00.847 --> 35:02.932
We should call Romero. I
got the guy's license plate.

35:02.933 --> 35:04.183
No, we've had too many cops.

35:04.184 --> 35:06.435
No, it's probably her pimp or whatever.

35:06.436 --> 35:08.854
- You scared him off, right?
- Well, yeah, but...

35:08.855 --> 35:10.272
What are you two talking about?

35:10.273 --> 35:11.323
Nothing.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.276
Nothing.

35:14.277 --> 35:15.911
Don't you have an essay to write?

35:15.912 --> 35:18.030
Yeah, but all the secretive,
agitated whispering...

35:18.031 --> 35:20.115
It was a little distracting.

35:23.870 --> 35:26.422
What's going on?

35:26.423 --> 35:28.874
We were just talking.

35:28.875 --> 35:31.377
Dylan, what were you just talking about?

35:31.378 --> 35:33.012
Look, don't worry about it, Norman.

35:33.013 --> 35:34.213
I obviously have a right

35:34.214 --> 35:35.931
to know what goes on in my own house...

35:35.932 --> 35:38.801
Oh, for God sakes, Norman,
you're acting like a child.

35:38.802 --> 35:42.104
Stop it.

35:42.105 --> 35:44.022
Fine.

35:47.944 --> 35:50.229
[door slams]

35:50.230 --> 35:51.480
Give it to me.

35:51.481 --> 35:53.983
The last thing she did was give this to me.

35:53.984 --> 35:55.785
She died making this gesture. I can't.

35:55.786 --> 35:57.069
You don't even know what it is.

35:57.070 --> 35:58.788
Well, what if it's something incredible?

35:58.789 --> 36:00.289
What if it's something that can save us?

36:00.290 --> 36:01.791
Please don't make me give it up.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.242
I'll hide it at the farm, okay?

36:03.243 --> 36:05.877
But I'm not letting it stay in this house.

36:07.798 --> 36:10.298
I don't want anything to happen to you.

36:46.369 --> 36:49.255
Where are you going?

36:49.256 --> 36:51.791
Uh, to the farm. I left something.

36:51.792 --> 36:53.259
What aren't you telling me?

36:53.260 --> 36:55.294
Why are you lying to me?

36:55.295 --> 36:58.464
What's going on?

36:58.465 --> 37:01.267
Norman, stay the hell out of it, okay?

37:01.268 --> 37:02.967
It doesn't concern you.

37:09.192 --> 37:10.809
[door closes]

38:28.140 --> 38:29.357
Hey, what's wrong?

38:29.358 --> 38:31.192
What are you doing here so late?

38:31.193 --> 38:33.311
I was just, uh...

38:33.312 --> 38:34.729
I was messing with the timer earlier,

38:34.730 --> 38:36.815
and I forgot to reset it.

38:36.816 --> 38:39.651
You could have called me or Gunner.

38:39.652 --> 38:42.987
Yeah, but, um... Gunner's out.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.989
And, you know, you've
been through enough today,

38:44.990 --> 38:47.709
so I figured maybe you were sleeping.

38:47.710 --> 38:50.712
[sighs]

38:50.713 --> 38:53.998
You doing okay?

38:53.999 --> 38:57.669
Yeah, I'm all right.

38:57.670 --> 39:02.140
You know, thanks for
letting me carry on today.

39:02.141 --> 39:05.559
I know it's got to... it's
got to be tough on you.

39:09.765 --> 39:11.766
I'm gonna, um...

39:11.767 --> 39:13.767
Yeah, all right.

39:22.995 --> 39:24.696
[door latch clicks loudly]

39:24.697 --> 39:26.865
Hey, get some rest.

39:26.866 --> 39:29.000
What the hell's going on here, Dylan?

39:29.001 --> 39:31.869
[ominous music]

39:36.041 --> 39:37.876
Does Mom know he's here?

39:37.877 --> 39:40.044
Is this what you two have
been whispering about?

39:40.045 --> 39:41.962
Is she allowing this?

39:45.718 --> 39:47.184
No, we...

39:49.688 --> 39:52.190
We've been talking about you.

39:52.191 --> 39:55.360
We're concerned about you...

39:55.361 --> 39:57.978
About your state of mind.

40:00.366 --> 40:03.067
Well, I'm not the one
harboring my mother's rapist.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.369
Look, we don't want any trouble.

40:04.370 --> 40:06.237
Oh, you don't want any trouble from me?

40:06.238 --> 40:08.156
That's funny, like I'm the outsider

40:08.157 --> 40:10.074
and you're not.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.994
We'll see who's on the outside.

40:12.995 --> 40:14.245
Norman.

40:14.246 --> 40:16.080
Norman, you better not tell her.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.165
Go to hell, Dylan!

40:19.919 --> 40:22.086
Norman.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.972
Damn it, Norman, stop!

40:23.973 --> 40:26.840
Norman, stop!

40:28.761 --> 40:30.011
You're not gonna tell her.

40:30.012 --> 40:31.813
You're not gonna tell her!

40:31.814 --> 40:33.648
You're not gonna tell her!

40:33.649 --> 40:36.016
- Get up!
- Get the hell off me, Caleb!

40:38.103 --> 40:39.237
You can't tell her, you understand me?

40:39.238 --> 40:40.772
He raped her!

40:40.773 --> 40:41.990
If you tell her, you'll be sorry

40:41.991 --> 40:43.107
the rest of your life.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.859
What are you gonna do, huh... Kill me?

40:52.618 --> 40:55.036
Please, Norman.

40:55.037 --> 40:58.957
Everything I've built with Mom, it'll...

40:58.958 --> 41:01.708
it'll all be destroyed.

41:08.267 --> 41:11.019
You've already destroyed it.

41:11.020 --> 41:13.221
You betrayed Mother,

41:13.222 --> 41:15.272
and she needs to know.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.614
I didn't know what to do.

41:27.403 --> 41:30.622
Norman, please.

41:30.623 --> 41:33.992
[engine turning over]

41:33.993 --> 41:36.877
[dramatic music]

41:47.824 --> 41:49.004
I'm sorry.
