WEBVTT

00:10.344 --> 00:12.430
Okay,
let's go over it one more time.

00:12.430 --> 00:14.140
Your parents
arrive stage left

00:14.140 --> 00:15.933
and are instantly charmed
by my sparkling small talk

00:15.933 --> 00:17.518
and unpasteurized
cheese plate.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.270
We then whisk them away
on your 'tour'

00:19.270 --> 00:21.313
where I serve
amazed wonderment

00:21.313 --> 00:24.233
as your forestry know-how
puts Daisy Crockett to shame.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.735
Forrest plays the role

00:25.735 --> 00:27.278
of your adorable
Park Ranger Supervisor,

00:27.278 --> 00:28.738
your mom and dad
believe the lie,

00:28.738 --> 00:30.406
and your rep
as golden child is safe.

00:30.406 --> 00:33.200
Or...

00:34.577 --> 00:35.911
We could just
tell them the truth.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.288
Nuh-uh.
If my parents find out

00:37.288 --> 00:38.873
I've been lying all summer,

00:38.873 --> 00:40.791
it's enforced tutoring gigs
'til I graduate.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.376
I'm not ready
to be a disappointment.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.711
On the upside, nobody cares

00:43.711 --> 00:45.045
if you waste
your best skin years

00:45.045 --> 00:46.464
banging baristas
and bartenders.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.716
Hmm.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.092
Game time.
Grab the cheese!

00:52.261 --> 00:54.221
- Oh, my God.
- Welcome!

00:54.221 --> 00:57.266
Can I tempt you
with a smoky camembert...

01:06.150 --> 01:07.109
Riley, you're back.

01:07.651 --> 01:10.654
- From 1982.
- Hi.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.239
You have to go.
My parents are coming.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.325
And she told them that
we made up so she could stay.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.328
Okay, SparkNotes are:
Justin re-proposed,

01:17.328 --> 01:19.121
and you had an intimate ceremony
on the rocks.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.873
I sang "Say You'll Be There,"
very cheeky, we laughed,

01:20.873 --> 01:22.416
Justin cried,
you made a chocolate tart,

01:22.416 --> 01:23.709
and Justin's vows
took, like, 20 minutes.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.669
But Riley, please,
just do this for me.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.256
- I need cheese.
- No, not the soft one.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.218
- Gives you the toots.
- Yeah.

01:33.344 --> 01:34.929
Oh, but that final dress?

01:34.929 --> 01:37.348
- Yes.
- Spectacular.

01:37.348 --> 01:38.724
- Amazing.
- Ah.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.100
We're so in agreement.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.811
Well,
the Balenciaga Crocs

01:41.811 --> 01:44.605
were both ironic,
yet unapologetically sincere.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.607
- I was gutted.
- Mmm.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.442
If I want to be ironic,

01:48.442 --> 01:50.110
I only need to see
your mother's hairdresser.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.698
Nice that a part of Mimsy
will live on when she's gone.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.245
You okay, babe?

01:59.954 --> 02:02.081
You haven't said zip
about your mom's test results.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.541
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:03.541 --> 02:05.292
I'm just gonna
go get a jump on lunch.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.213
Hey, can we do breakfast
for lunch again?

02:09.213 --> 02:11.340
- You're a grown man.
- I love you.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.193
<i>♪ Ba, ba, ba, ba,
ba, ba, ba, ba ♪</i>

02:31.193 --> 02:35.447
<i>♪ I wanna be sedated ♪</i>

02:40.703 --> 02:41.579
Hmm.

02:42.872 --> 02:44.206
Now, Daddy wanted to come,

02:44.206 --> 02:46.000
but a patient of his
got caught trying on

02:46.000 --> 02:47.543
a new fursona at work.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.088
Animal fixation
is a lonely road,

02:51.088 --> 02:52.131
isn't it, Riley?

02:53.299 --> 02:55.718
Uh, I don't work
with animals anymore.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.470
I just showcased a series
- called <i>Hit and Runaways.</i>

02:58.470 --> 03:00.931
To Paris.
Uh, he... he was...

03:00.931 --> 03:03.475
He was in-- He was in Paris.
He just got back from Paris.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.603
- Riley was in Paris?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.521
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm, yeah, mm-hmm.

03:07.521 --> 03:11.525
Uh, uh, for-- for the wedding,
uh, honeymoon.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.653
Yeah, because the art world's
having a honeymoon

03:14.653 --> 03:16.488
with its newest star over here.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.992
Hmm, yeah.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.453
It's not far.
It's just half day's drive.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.664
- You drove to Paris?
- Ontario.

03:26.165 --> 03:29.251
It's, uh, the cobblestone
capital of Canada.

03:29.251 --> 03:32.463
- It's... gorgeous.
- Hmm.

03:33.672 --> 03:37.301
We're saving Paris, Paris,
the... the Europe Paris,

03:37.301 --> 03:39.386
for our honeymoon,
right, honey?

03:39.386 --> 03:40.512
Right?

03:41.180 --> 03:42.348
Yeah.

03:42.348 --> 03:44.058
Mmm!

03:44.058 --> 03:46.518
Sounds like you two have got
a lot of catching up to do.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.063
Why don't Billie and I
give you some space?

03:49.063 --> 03:51.607
Oh, but I booked Justin
on the tour with us.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.525
It is important
for couples to take time

03:53.525 --> 03:55.235
for each other
after they've been apart.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.404
And it is also important
for mothers and daughters

03:57.404 --> 03:59.156
to take time for each other
after they've been apart

03:59.156 --> 04:01.492
all summer,
and miss each other terribly.

04:07.373 --> 04:10.334
- Yeah. Yeah. You go.
- Mmm.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.962
- Oh, the fun you'll have.
- Well, okay then.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.089
Now...

04:15.089 --> 04:18.050
I wanna hear all about
the vows at dinner.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.427
Hear about 'em?

04:20.427 --> 04:23.138
- Oh, God.
- Well, you're gonna.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.032
Okay, one foot
at a time, yeah?

04:43.492 --> 04:45.452
Okay, all right.

04:46.245 --> 04:47.955
Not bad, Mom.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.082
So, how you doing?

04:51.333 --> 04:52.876
The nausea will pass

04:52.876 --> 04:54.712
now that we are out
of that hell taco.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.922
Yeah, that's why
I wanted Justin to come.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.507
He has a steady paddle.

04:58.507 --> 04:59.967
You can stop
pretending, Billie.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.219
I know you're
covering for Justin.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.596
He and Riley didn't
work things out, did they?

05:05.723 --> 05:06.932
How'd you know?

05:07.558 --> 05:09.435
That earring was
a classic coping mechanism.

05:09.435 --> 05:11.729
The angle of the dangle
was a dead giveaway.

05:11.729 --> 05:14.356
Look, I know you love Justin,
but giving up a dream job

05:14.356 --> 05:16.108
to help him
is not the way to show it.

05:17.443 --> 05:18.986
I'm really sorry, Mom.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.363
Okay, we need to be honest
with each other.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.781
You know you can tell me
anything, right?

05:22.781 --> 05:23.615
Ladies!

05:25.868 --> 05:27.578
Hope you're
not looking for the woods,

05:27.578 --> 05:28.871
because all you're getting
is a Forrest.

05:30.372 --> 05:33.542
Hey, uh, Mom,
this is my supervisor,

05:33.542 --> 05:34.877
Forrest Buisson.

05:34.877 --> 05:37.379
Park ranger,
kombucha microbrewer,

05:37.379 --> 05:38.756
and Billie's number one fan.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.760
It is so lovely
to meet you, Mrs. Barnes.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.179
Uh... Mrs. Jackson.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.807
Thanks for rolling
with Billie's one act.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.434
That was really cool.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.730
Listen, Riley, I...

05:54.730 --> 05:56.356
I realized something
while you were away,

05:56.356 --> 05:58.275
and I was kind of hoping
we could talk about it,

05:58.275 --> 05:59.651
'cause I've been
rolling around and...

06:01.653 --> 06:02.613
That's all you're taking?

06:03.155 --> 06:04.531
I got clothes
at the Gas Go.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.033
Oh, like, regular ones,

06:06.033 --> 06:07.868
or more from the Backstreet Boys
home collection?

06:08.410 --> 06:10.704
I'm a different person now,

06:10.704 --> 06:12.164
and if you can't accept that...

06:12.164 --> 06:14.041
Billie? Anyone home?

06:14.041 --> 06:18.045
- Hey.
- Love le look, Riley.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.714
Very Paris, Ontario.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.341
- Justin.
- Jayne.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.176
I need, like,
a teeny little favour from you,

06:24.176 --> 06:25.219
and my favourite
teen girl boss.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.597
Ooh, she's on a tour
with Naomi.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.724
Then it's over.

06:31.892 --> 06:35.479
I found the perfect spot
for a new boathouse,

06:35.479 --> 06:38.398
but the owners
will only sell to legacy lakers.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.944
Maisy's MIA,
Whoreen and Saggy said no,

06:41.944 --> 06:44.404
Billie and you posing
as a couple was my Hail Mary.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.532
gross.
thank you.

06:46.532 --> 06:50.828
The seller's specified
no greedy real estate agents,

06:51.328 --> 06:53.122
no soulless
house flippers,

06:53.122 --> 06:56.083
no influencer-fashionista-Paris
types like Riley.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.376
The lake trusted me

06:57.376 --> 06:59.711
to find a new home
for the boathouse.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.089
What am I gonna do?

07:02.589 --> 07:04.216
Come on, Jayne.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.301
You're gonna...
you're gonna think of something,

07:06.301 --> 07:08.846
you got that...
that presidential...

07:10.264 --> 07:11.265
...sparkle.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.684
- I do?
- Yeah.

07:13.684 --> 07:16.061
Yeah. Twinkle, twinkle,
who's a star?

07:16.061 --> 07:19.314
Maybe
I could manifest something.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.275
- I did read <i>The Secret.</i>
- Shh, shh, shh.

07:21.275 --> 07:25.195
I knew I could
count on my sassy gay besties.

07:25.195 --> 07:28.407
Okay, back on the pony.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.076
Thanks, girlfriends.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.078
- Work, queen.
- Work, diva!

07:33.078 --> 07:35.205
I feel dirty.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.207
It just flew
out of my mouth.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.711
You know,
I'm a legacy laker.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.131
It would be great
to have a new boathouse.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.844
- Maybe we could...
- Set aside our shit?

07:48.844 --> 07:50.429
- For the boathouse.
- Just for the boathouse.

07:50.429 --> 07:51.263
Yes.

07:52.598 --> 07:53.682
For the boathouse.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.976
Yeah, just like that, Mom.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.603
Hey, Forrest,
hey, Forrest, hi, Forrest.

07:57.603 --> 07:58.979
Can I talk to you
for a second?

07:58.979 --> 08:00.480
- Yeah.
- Okay, Mom,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.232
I'm gonna be right back.
I gotta chat itinerary.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.734
Do not put my purse
on the ground.

08:03.734 --> 08:04.568
Right.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.905
Where's the gear
I asked you to bring?

08:07.905 --> 08:09.656
It shipped out already.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.491
Our contract's
done this week,

08:11.491 --> 08:14.119
and head office wants
base camp packed up ASAP.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.454
Company lease is almost up.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.414
Um...

08:18.749 --> 08:20.667
okay, okay,
just fix your collar,

08:20.667 --> 08:22.085
and follow my lead, okay?

08:22.794 --> 08:25.964
- Okay, boss.
- No, no, you're my boss.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.008
All right.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.969
Okay,
and button those up, yeah?

08:32.346 --> 08:33.680
Here we go.

08:34.765 --> 08:37.935
Okay, the lake has
an amazing system of wetlands

08:37.935 --> 08:39.937
with swamps,
marshes, bogs, and fens.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.355
Now, you might think that...

08:41.355 --> 08:43.690
So... sorry, baby.
Did you say bog?

08:43.690 --> 08:46.443
Bog, like, quicksand bog?
Sinkhole bog?

08:46.443 --> 08:48.403
No, not in the marsh.
Not where we're going.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.738
But there's
a cool beaver habitat.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.406
Sorry, baby,
you're doing great,

08:51.406 --> 08:54.826
but I am gonna need waders,
a wetsuit, and a rabies shot

08:54.826 --> 08:57.454
if I am plunging
into a bucktooth rat's nest.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.332
Oh, um, all the boots
were signed out.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.000
You know, big,
big duck migration.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.669
It draws a crowd.

09:03.669 --> 09:06.672
We could duct tape
plastic bags over our boots.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.382
That's how
we stop trench foot

09:08.382 --> 09:10.050
when we're planting
in serious shnarb.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.928
- Shnarb?
- How about we, uh...

09:12.928 --> 09:14.846
we, uh, ditch the marsh
for today, boss?

09:14.846 --> 09:17.057
Uh, let's do something
more beginner-friendly.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.684
- Yes, for sure.
- Like, um...

09:20.185 --> 09:22.479
We could forage.

09:24.147 --> 09:24.982
For what?

09:25.857 --> 09:27.901
Roots, nuts, mushrooms.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.070
Can't mushrooms be poisonous?

09:30.654 --> 09:33.407
For six hours,
if we're lucky.

09:35.534 --> 09:39.413
God, it's a beautiful,
beautiful spot, Phoebe.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.498
Oh, actually
it's pronounced Fo-ee-bee.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.417
Oh, I'm so sorry.
That must happen a lot.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.251
You're the first.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.921
Yeah, I wish I could keep
Gam-Gam's cottage,

09:47.921 --> 09:49.506
but we live out west now.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.675
So, how long
have you two been together?

09:52.384 --> 09:54.720
Oh, it feels like forever.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.347
It's just 'cause his hair
is frozen in time.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.517
Well, have a walk
of the property,

10:00.517 --> 10:02.602
and I'll be inside
when you're ready.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.937
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.773
Hey, if we're gonna pull this
off, lose the hair jokes.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.775
I know, I'm sorry.
It's just that I have this thing

10:08.775 --> 10:11.528
that I really want to tell you
and every time I go to do it,

10:11.528 --> 10:13.113
all that comes out is,
"Why the mustache?"

10:13.113 --> 10:15.574
Hey! What are you guys
doing here?

10:16.283 --> 10:17.909
- Hey, um... uh...
- Hi.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.412
We're trying
to save the boathouse.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.080
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

10:22.080 --> 10:23.623
- Manifesting my sparkle.
- Yeah.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.500
Wait, are you trying
to steal my thunder?

10:25.500 --> 10:28.045
Smells
like thunder theft to me.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.338
No, that's just Riley.

10:29.338 --> 10:30.964
I told him
to lay off the brie.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.924
We thought your sparkle
could use some backup.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.594
And decided to fake being
a happy couple to get the place?

10:35.594 --> 10:37.179
You stole my manifestation.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.096
Jayne, Jayne, Jayne.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.975
- We can all manifest together.
- Yeah.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.144
We each pretend
to be a happy couple...

10:44.144 --> 10:46.188
- Who's pretending?
- And then we double our chances

10:46.188 --> 10:47.481
of getting the place.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.025
I'm supposed to trust
the Homo Torch

10:50.025 --> 10:51.902
and George Michael
to seal the deal?

10:53.403 --> 10:56.656
Wow, sounds like Ruffles is
a little afraid of competition.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.785
Please, we are a way better
fake couple than you.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.286
I've been faking it
for years.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.330
Care to put
some money on that?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.874
- Faking what, babe?
- Even better.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.501
Whoever gets the owner
to sell,

11:07.501 --> 11:09.419
gets naming rights
to the new boathouse.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.338
Brace yourself, Blondie.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.715
It's on, Donkey Dongs.
Ha-ha!

11:14.091 --> 11:16.343
It's a compliment, Wayne.
It's a compliment.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.556
Are you kidding?

11:22.224 --> 11:24.893
- Of course.
- Kombuch, we're in luck.

11:24.893 --> 11:28.021
Okay, so you can boil these,
make tea with these,

11:28.021 --> 11:30.357
and they go great
with steak.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.234
Oh, we're foraging
for steak, too, now?

11:33.485 --> 11:35.529
Okay, um, yeah, plan B.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.535
I can eat the chocolate
to make it look more real.

11:41.535 --> 11:42.411
Hmm.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.162
Here.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.498
Brazil nuts
and goji berries?

11:46.498 --> 11:48.750
We look like liars, Forrest.

11:48.750 --> 11:49.709
Aren't we kinda?

11:51.002 --> 11:51.837
Well...

11:55.549 --> 11:56.842
Just go, I'll...

11:56.842 --> 11:58.635
I'll tell her
you got called away

11:58.635 --> 12:00.429
on a poison oak emergency
or something.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.889
- Okay, sweet.
- Yeah.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.433
We're still pre-gaming
for Bush Prom?

12:04.433 --> 12:06.309
- Sure.
- Yeah, okay.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.311
- No!
- Shit, I'm sorry.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.312
Forgot I was your boss.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.236
Oh, uh,
look what we foraged.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.239
Hmm... I see Craisins
are still in season.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.915
Ugh, I am just so glad
you're all legacy cottagers.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.209
- Yeah.
- And Gammy would be, too.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.503
When she died
in this very room,

12:33.503 --> 12:36.047
she made me promise
we'd only sell to people

12:36.047 --> 12:38.425
as in love with the lake
as each other.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.927
So, before we get to money,

12:40.927 --> 12:42.762
and we will,
Gam-Gam wants a Tesla...

12:43.638 --> 12:45.307
we'd love
to hear your story.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.017
Who you are, how you met.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.478
I'm sorry,
you keep saying "we."

12:49.978 --> 12:51.396
Me and Gam-Gam.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.024
She's always listening.

12:54.566 --> 12:55.567
Oh.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.277
O-M-Jeepers creepers.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.821
Um, but Wayne and I
were just saying

12:59.821 --> 13:02.240
- how much we love ghosts.
- Yeah.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.326
Aw.

13:04.326 --> 13:06.286
Not in a sexy way though.
Don't worry.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.079
- No.
- No, no.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.915
Well, 'cause, you know,
some people

13:09.915 --> 13:11.374
are probably into that, so...

13:11.374 --> 13:12.667
Mmm-hmm.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.671
Oh, well,
Gam-Gam was an old perv,

13:16.671 --> 13:18.465
so how about
the ghost fucker goes first?

13:18.465 --> 13:19.883
Yeah, I...

13:20.926 --> 13:23.970
uh... [sighs] su... sure.

13:24.596 --> 13:25.430
Um...

13:26.348 --> 13:29.643
Hi, Gam-Gam, I'm Justin,
and this is my...

13:31.144 --> 13:32.270
this is Riley.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.981
Uh, but that mustache
is all for you.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.193
I'm sorry.
I know, I can't help it. Um...

13:38.735 --> 13:41.780
So, we met last summer,
which I know doesn't seem

13:41.780 --> 13:44.407
like a very long time,
but, you know,

13:44.407 --> 13:46.243
in gay years,
that's like a straight five.

13:46.243 --> 13:47.327
Maybe even like a seven.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.414
Um, and Riley is...

13:55.043 --> 13:55.961
...pretty great.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.048
Which totally
freaked me out.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.218
'Cause the men in my life,
you know,

14:03.218 --> 14:04.928
they haven't
always been there for me.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.721
And whenever
I would get close to a guy,

14:06.721 --> 14:09.099
I just developed
this really obnoxious habit

14:09.099 --> 14:10.308
of running the other way...

14:11.309 --> 14:13.812
which meant that I was the only
one that could let me down.

14:14.813 --> 14:15.730
And I don't know.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.234
You know, I don't know

14:19.234 --> 14:20.986
if we're gonna
be together forever.

14:23.989 --> 14:26.324
And Riley is about to take
the art world by storm.

14:27.450 --> 14:29.452
His work's been described
as if Cindy Sherman

14:29.452 --> 14:30.954
and Amy Sedaris
had an Etsy page,

14:30.954 --> 14:34.499
which is actually
very correct.

14:36.293 --> 14:37.711
You read my reviews?

14:38.795 --> 14:40.171
I read every single one.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.425
- There was only one.
- Yeah.

14:43.425 --> 14:46.386
I remember meeting Jayne
like it was yesterday, Gam-Gam.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.513
- Wayne.
- Er, sh, I got it.

14:50.056 --> 14:53.310
CSIS had just promoted me
to head assassin, right?

14:53.310 --> 14:54.894
Oh!

14:54.894 --> 14:56.730
Back then,
I had ice in my veins,

14:56.730 --> 14:59.274
and, uh...
and early onset diabeetus,

14:59.274 --> 15:02.152
which they overlooked,
because my kill shot

15:02.152 --> 15:04.195
made Liam Neeson
look like a pussycat.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.447
Oh...

15:07.157 --> 15:10.702
But my... my job took me to
some dark and dangerous places.

15:13.455 --> 15:16.875
So, for the safety of my family
and friends, I had to...

15:16.875 --> 15:18.835
I had to disappear forever.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.215
So, at a roadside bar
on this very lake...

15:25.175 --> 15:27.719
that's where I had
my "Going Underground" party.

15:30.639 --> 15:34.267
That's where I saw
this majestic goddess

15:34.267 --> 15:35.935
for the first time.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.314
She was riding the crap
out of a mechanical bull.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.695
The ice in my veins melted. Instantly.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.031
I couldn't be
an assassin again.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.867
I mean,
I was blinded by love, or...

15:51.785 --> 15:52.952
maybe, it was the diabeetus.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.166
One thing's for sure,
I knew my calling in life.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.252
My job was
to make Jaynie happy.

16:06.383 --> 16:09.761
Well! That will be Gam-Gam
with her decision.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.763
We keep a rotary dial
just for her.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.348
Excuse me.

16:20.605 --> 16:21.773
Right between the eyes.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.275
Diabetes.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.819
It's diabetes.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.238
Seemed like you
and that supervisor

16:28.238 --> 16:30.699
had a close
working relationship.

16:30.699 --> 16:33.034
Yeah, it was actually,
two rangers

16:33.034 --> 16:34.285
I could have gone with.

16:34.285 --> 16:35.954
Think I chose
the wrong one.

16:35.954 --> 16:39.040
- Mmm, what makes you say that?
- Oh, it's...

16:40.667 --> 16:42.627
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you're mirroring.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.379
You promised
you'd stop therapizing me.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.089
What... what
am I supposed to do?

16:46.089 --> 16:47.882
How else will you see
that it's a bad idea

16:47.882 --> 16:50.176
- to date your supervisor?
- You were Dad's thesis advisor.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.430
- For one year!
- Is that... is that Naomi?

16:53.430 --> 16:55.223
Oh, Maisy.
What brings you here?

16:55.765 --> 16:57.684
Oh, I was just
going for a little dip.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.562
Oh, do you always
go swimming fully dressed?

17:00.562 --> 17:02.397
I needed a break
from my mother.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.024
Oh, Billie told me
about her diagnosis.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.985
- I was sorry to hear it.
- Oh, don't be.

17:06.985 --> 17:09.320
I've been praying for it
for many, many years.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.989
Why are you dressed
like a zookeeper?

17:11.573 --> 17:14.075
Oh, I'm doing tours
for Parks Canada,

17:14.075 --> 17:15.827
and we are actually,
in the middle of one now,

17:15.827 --> 17:17.370
so we should
pick this up later.

17:18.496 --> 17:19.539
And you're buying this?

17:20.665 --> 17:21.958
I'm sure my daughter,

17:21.958 --> 17:23.251
whose mother
worked very hard with her

17:23.251 --> 17:24.502
to get
an important internship,

17:24.502 --> 17:26.004
wouldn't keep
anything from me.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.380
Yeah, no. Great.
We're on the same page.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.339
So, let's go.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.049
Oh, so you don't know

17:30.049 --> 17:31.843
that Billie
ditched her internship

17:31.843 --> 17:34.220
for baby's first Burning Man,
and then she got fired.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.973
Billie,
what is she talking about?

17:38.099 --> 17:39.934
Tree planting.
She lasted two days.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.561
A week and two days.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.897
I thought we were past
keeping secrets, Billie.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.523
You would have never
let me tree plant, Mom.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.317
Because it
would have been a mistake.

17:47.317 --> 17:48.568
Yeah, but my mistake.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.320
"Oh, wah, wah, wah,

17:50.320 --> 17:52.197
my parents
are invested in my future."

17:52.197 --> 17:53.782
Don't you come for me, Nell.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.366
If you want
to make your own mistakes,

17:55.366 --> 17:56.659
start by owning them.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.203
Oh, like you do.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.914
Going for a dip fully clothed
like a crazy person?

18:00.914 --> 18:01.998
Enough!

18:04.751 --> 18:06.753
- Sit.
- What... me?

18:06.753 --> 18:09.172
Yeah, you, her,
sit in the ship.

18:09.172 --> 18:11.090
- It's a canoe.
- I don't care what it is.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.300
- Get in the boat.
- Okay.

18:12.884 --> 18:14.677
Wayne did it!

18:14.677 --> 18:16.471
He saved the boathouse.

18:17.388 --> 18:19.265
We'll call it Wayne Manor.

18:19.265 --> 18:23.228
Uh, I saved the boathouse.
We're calling it The Lovehouse.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.438
- That sounds like a brothel.
- The Joyhouse?

18:25.438 --> 18:26.606
So much worse.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.192
Um, I just got
an anonymous call

18:29.192 --> 18:30.777
saying that you all
know each other,

18:30.777 --> 18:33.196
and you wanna
tear down Gam-Gam's cottage

18:33.196 --> 18:34.531
to build
some kind of group home?

18:34.531 --> 18:35.865
- What?
- No.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.325
- That's crazy.
- No!

18:38.368 --> 18:40.328
Gam-Gam hates liars.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.542
- You'd better go.
- Go.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.460
Get out. Get out!

18:47.460 --> 18:49.254
- I can't get my jacket on!
- Leave!

18:49.254 --> 18:50.672
I can't get
my jacket on!

18:50.672 --> 18:52.507
Leave!

18:53.424 --> 18:54.843
Let's start
with why we're here.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.804
Please remember
to use "I" statements.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.723
Maisy,
won't you go first?

19:01.850 --> 19:04.894
I am here because my mom
told the truth

19:04.894 --> 19:07.438
for the third time in her life,
and I'm supposed to feel bad,

19:07.438 --> 19:09.315
because she's actually,
really dying?

19:09.315 --> 19:11.985
When has anyone ever
been able to make you feel bad?

19:11.985 --> 19:13.903
- About anything?
- "I" statements, please.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.030
Fine.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.577
I think that Maisy
is a textbook narcissist

19:20.577 --> 19:22.120
who is using her issues
with her mom

19:22.120 --> 19:24.205
to justify doing
whatever the eff she wants.

19:24.873 --> 19:28.918
Okay, well, I think that Billie
is a sucky little baby

19:28.918 --> 19:30.670
who blames her mom
for smothering her,

19:30.670 --> 19:33.256
instead of admitting she stayed
for tree planter tail.

19:33.256 --> 19:35.174
Maybe we put a pin
in the "I" statements.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.010
I'm sorry,
I'm a sucky baby?

19:37.010 --> 19:39.554
Your mom is dying, and she just
wants to make it right with you.

19:39.554 --> 19:41.014
By stealing my children
like a witch.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.724
Maybe, they just like being
with someone

19:42.724 --> 19:44.350
who isn't worried
about who they should be,

19:44.350 --> 19:45.768
but is cool with who they are.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.395
From the girl
whose mom is so cool

19:47.395 --> 19:48.897
she trusts her with Justin,

19:48.897 --> 19:50.940
a man with the self-awareness
of a Polly Pocket.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.984
Maisy, you can't get past
the stuff with your mom,

19:52.984 --> 19:54.819
because if you did,
you'd lose your trauma card,

19:54.819 --> 19:57.238
and your free pass to be the
biggest bitch on the lake, okay?

19:57.238 --> 19:58.615
Sorry, Mom.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.034
Maybe not the words
I would have chosen.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.953
We'll talk about properly
framing a diagnosis at home...

20:04.787 --> 20:06.623
But my baby's not wrong.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.546
My insurance
only covers an hour,

20:13.546 --> 20:15.089
so I better be getting home.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.800
My mother's blood sugar
isn't gonna spike itself.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.052
I can show myself out.

20:27.602 --> 20:29.270
That's what
we call a breakthrough.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.903
Who would want
to blow a shot

20:36.903 --> 20:38.488
at finding a new home
for the boathouse?

20:38.488 --> 20:40.907
Probably, the same person
who stole Jaynie's spare,

20:40.907 --> 20:43.326
nailed her tires, because they
hate Tegan and Sara?

20:43.326 --> 20:45.119
Or because they hate
the boathouse,

20:45.119 --> 20:46.663
but who could hate
the boathouse?

20:47.288 --> 20:49.165
You know,
ruining the talent show,

20:49.165 --> 20:51.584
and tipping "Fo-ee-bee" off,
that could be a pattern.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.170
If someone
is trying to stop us

20:54.170 --> 20:56.464
from bringing
the boathouse back,

20:56.464 --> 20:59.550
then maybe they could've
burnt it down, too.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.469
Holy balls.

21:02.553 --> 21:05.306
Justin said someone used
his fireworks to start the fire.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.769
Which means they were a guest
at our wedding.

21:11.104 --> 21:12.772
Which also means?

21:14.023 --> 21:15.817
There's an arsonator
among us.

21:15.817 --> 21:18.152
- And?
- And Justin was right.

21:18.152 --> 21:21.322
Oh, God, there it is!

21:21.322 --> 21:22.865
- Yeah.
- I think we parked up here.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.158
- Okay.
- God!

21:24.909 --> 21:27.120
It's just been,
like, a really...

21:27.870 --> 21:29.831
really long summer.

21:30.373 --> 21:31.499
This feels so good.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.807
And where have we been today?

21:47.807 --> 21:49.642
Oh, were you worried
I was missing?

21:50.268 --> 21:52.311
Hardly, I'd be worried
for the sad miscreant

21:52.311 --> 21:53.730
who tried to grab you.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.941
Oh, Opal, I'm sorry.

21:56.941 --> 21:58.901
I just get jealous
of you and Nana.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.738
You'll understand someday
when you have kids.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.322
Or corgis.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.241
They're gonna love me
so much more than you.

22:14.751 --> 22:17.211
So, did I fool you
even a little bit?

22:17.211 --> 22:19.172
Until you tried
to make me believe

22:19.172 --> 22:21.799
that unqualified hunk
was your boss.

22:21.799 --> 22:24.218
Yeah, he did not read
the handout.

22:24.218 --> 22:25.386
Gotta get better at lying.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.930
That is not the takeaway
I was hoping for.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.348
What you need
to get better at

22:29.348 --> 22:30.975
is giving me
the benefit of the doubt.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.227
You know, it is healthy
to want different things

22:33.227 --> 22:34.687
from your parents,
but it is not okay

22:34.687 --> 22:36.898
to assume that we won't
respect your choices.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.233
That said...

22:40.860 --> 22:42.195
I think
you made the right one.

22:42.987 --> 22:45.698
Okay, now you're lying
because my tour was trash.

22:45.698 --> 22:46.949
Okay, your tour
may have been fake,

22:46.949 --> 22:48.618
but making me feel safe
was real.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.370
I even peed in the woods.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.790
Making people like me
feel at home in nature

22:53.790 --> 22:54.707
is a real gift.

22:56.334 --> 22:57.585
Thanks, Mom.

22:57.585 --> 22:58.461
Come here, baby.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.715
We'll figure out the rest
when you get home.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.801
You have the rest of your life
to pad your CV.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.929
Goodbye, Justin.

23:07.929 --> 23:11.307
And next time, my daughter
asks you to lie for her...

23:11.307 --> 23:13.518
I seek approval
within myself,

23:13.518 --> 23:15.478
and I draw
clear boundaries.

23:15.478 --> 23:17.688
- Mmm-hmm, excellent mirroring.
- Thank you.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.315
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, Mom.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.402
- Bye, Naomi.
- Mrs. Jackson.

23:25.196 --> 23:27.782
- Mrs. Jackson.
- Every time.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.785
Does she hate me?

23:30.785 --> 23:34.247
No, she likes
that she's the parenting-do,

23:34.247 --> 23:35.373
and you're
the parenting-don't.

23:35.373 --> 23:36.249
That's great.

23:37.542 --> 23:38.960
Oh, Mom must have
forgotten something.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.212
Oh, hi.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.381
Hi.

23:44.006 --> 23:45.049
Hi.

23:45.591 --> 23:46.759
Hi.

23:47.343 --> 23:48.177
Hi.

23:48.886 --> 23:51.097
Well, I've got a thing
in my room, so...

23:51.097 --> 23:53.099
- Yeah.
- ...I'm just gonna...

23:53.099 --> 23:54.559
- and you two can, uh...
- Mm-hmm.

23:55.309 --> 23:56.936
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23:57.562 --> 23:59.063
I just came to grab...

23:59.063 --> 24:00.148
Oh, yeah, the...

24:00.648 --> 24:03.442
from earlier.

24:07.822 --> 24:08.865
So...

24:09.782 --> 24:13.703
there was this thing
in my review about...

24:14.620 --> 24:17.165
the artist seeming
uninterested in the victim.

24:17.999 --> 24:21.502
"Choosing instead to draw the
eye to the escaping vehicle."

24:22.170 --> 24:23.796
Yeah, I read it.

24:25.047 --> 24:27.675
I think I did that
when I proposed.

24:28.759 --> 24:31.554
You know,
I threw myself in front of you,

24:31.554 --> 24:33.181
stopped you speeding away.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.392
I was scared
I couldn't keep up.

24:37.852 --> 24:38.978
Riley...

24:40.771 --> 24:42.064
it really was your fault.

24:44.358 --> 24:47.361
And the only accident
that I would speed away from...

24:48.321 --> 24:50.990
is that haircut
and that mustache.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.533
- Wow.
- And that earring.

24:53.075 --> 24:54.619
I love the earring.

24:54.619 --> 24:56.329
You look
like budget Harry Styles.

24:57.205 --> 24:59.582
If Gwyneth Paltrow's
vagina candle was an earring,

24:59.582 --> 25:01.876
that...
would be the earring.

25:01.876 --> 25:03.669
Are we shit talking
Riley's earring?

25:03.669 --> 25:04.962
- Yes.
- No.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.090
I kinda like it. You look like
Fonzie from <i>"Happy Gays."</i>

25:08.090 --> 25:09.759
- Burn.
- Okay.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.260
- I'm leaving now.
- Okay.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.179
You look like
a grandfather clock

25:13.179 --> 25:14.388
from a gay antique store.

25:14.388 --> 25:16.015
Antique stores are gay.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.311
Can't help myself.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.271
Well, that was some
flirty bullying.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.398
Yeah, we learn it
in grade school.

25:24.398 --> 25:26.651
The gays need
a new love language, though.

25:26.651 --> 25:29.779
Hey, quick Q for you,
Missy Lou.

25:30.696 --> 25:33.366
How would you feel about
playing the Mulder to my Scully?

25:33.366 --> 25:35.117
If you just want to wear
shoulder pads again, Justin,

25:35.117 --> 25:37.370
- then wear them.
- No. Well, yeah, but no.

25:38.246 --> 25:41.249
I know
who the boathouse arsonist is,

25:41.249 --> 25:43.584
but I need your help
to get the truth out there.

25:45.628 --> 25:47.505
I can't believe
Lovejoy called it

25:47.505 --> 25:48.839
with the boathouse arsoner.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.341
I know.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.760
Oh, Clementine Farnsworth
is gonna be so pissed.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.595
I wrecked her on LinkedIn

25:54.595 --> 25:56.389
'cause I thought
she nailed my tires.

26:01.185 --> 26:04.063
Maybe, Special Agent Wayne

26:04.063 --> 26:06.774
could come out of retirement
for one last hit?

26:09.986 --> 26:11.737
I'm not gonna kill
Clementine, Jayne.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.949
Oh, you mean sex?

26:18.327 --> 26:19.161
All right.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.580
Good.
Mama needs to nut.

26:24.375 --> 26:25.251
Actually...

26:26.544 --> 26:27.628
I'm gonna pass, Jayne.

26:29.130 --> 26:31.382
Yeah, okay.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.971
I'm not a special agent.

26:39.015 --> 26:41.142
I'm still the same guy you met

26:41.142 --> 26:43.561
puking behind the boathouse
after a bunch of Jägerbombs.

26:45.980 --> 26:46.897
And I am...

26:47.773 --> 26:49.734
I'm really sorry
that I clipped your wings

26:49.734 --> 26:51.277
by just hanging around
all summer.

26:53.696 --> 26:56.032
I didn't mean
to keep you grounded.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.491
I know
you need to fly free.

26:59.577 --> 27:02.204
If you are
playing hard-to-get

27:02.204 --> 27:03.456
it is working.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.253
Good night, Jaynie.

27:11.213 --> 27:12.381
