WEBVTT

00:01.032 --> 00:04.635
(men shouting indistinctly)

00:07.708 --> 00:09.610
OH, YOU'RE DOING SO GOOD.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.212
NO. NO, HE'S NOT.
NOT--NOT REALLY.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.443
HARRIS, I'M OPEN!

00:12.443 --> 00:14.285
(Jules) LET'S GO, BABY!

00:14.285 --> 00:15.646
YOU ALMOST TOUCHED IT!

00:15.646 --> 00:18.489
(whistle blows)

00:18.489 --> 00:20.291
UM...

00:20.291 --> 00:21.622
IT'S REALLY COOL
OF YOU GUYS

00:21.622 --> 00:23.424
TO COME OUT FOR
THE PLAYOFF GAME. (pants)

00:23.424 --> 00:26.327
I REALIZE I'M NOT THE GREATEST
SKATER IN THE WORLD.

00:26.327 --> 00:29.130
OH, STOP IT. YOU LOOK
AMAZING OUT THERE.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.702
IS THIS WHY TRAVIS
THINKS HE'S SO HANDSOME?

00:31.702 --> 00:33.464
YEP. THAT'S ALL ME.

00:33.464 --> 00:34.665
(blows whistle)

00:34.665 --> 00:37.037
GAME ON! (laughs)

00:37.037 --> 00:39.070
I'M HAVING A THOUGHT.

00:39.070 --> 00:41.272
IF EVOLUTION IS REAL,

00:41.272 --> 00:44.275
WOULDN'T WE HAVE WHEELS
ON OUR FEET BY NOW?

00:44.275 --> 00:46.547
JELLY BEAN, YOU ARE
THE VERBAL EQUIVALENT

00:46.547 --> 00:48.449
OF HUFFING PAINT.

00:53.284 --> 00:54.485
OH!

00:54.485 --> 00:55.686
(gasps)
OH.

00:55.686 --> 00:57.328
OH, PLEASE.

00:57.328 --> 01:00.291
NOT THE FACE.
NOT THE FACE.

01:00.291 --> 01:03.364
HI. OH, HONEY.
LET ME SEE.

01:03.364 --> 01:04.595
UNH-UNH.

01:04.595 --> 01:06.197
I'M YOUR WIFE.

01:06.197 --> 01:08.639
I WILL LOVE YOU NO MATTER
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.

01:08.639 --> 01:10.571
(gasps)

01:10.571 --> 01:12.673
(lowered voice)
I DON'T THINK I CAN LOVE THAT.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.176
OH, MY GOD. (gags)

01:15.176 --> 01:21.782
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:21.782 --> 01:24.685
(groans)

01:24.685 --> 01:26.557
HONEY, YOU AWAKE?

01:26.557 --> 01:28.789
(mutters)

01:28.789 --> 01:30.591
(switch clicks)

01:30.591 --> 01:32.092
I CAN'T SLEEP EITHER.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.464
(mutters)

01:33.464 --> 01:35.196
AT LEAST I HAVE
SOME COMPANY.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.697
HEY, WHY DON'T WE
STAY UP ALL NIGHT

01:36.697 --> 01:38.669
AND MAKE IT
LIKE A SLUMBER PARTY?

01:38.669 --> 01:40.231
WE CAN WATCH TV

01:40.231 --> 01:43.103
AND, OH, WE CAN LOOK
THROUGH MY OLD YEARBOOK.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.705
(groans)

01:44.705 --> 01:47.638
AHH.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

01:47.638 --> 01:50.181
(mutters)
(flips pages)

01:50.181 --> 01:52.543
SOUNDS LIKE A "YES"
TO ME.

01:52.543 --> 01:54.215
OH, SEE THIS GUY--

01:54.215 --> 01:55.416
CHRIS JONES?

01:55.416 --> 01:56.787
I TOTALLY LET HIM
FEEL ME UP,

01:56.787 --> 01:59.650
AND ALL HE WROTE WAS,
"KEEP IN TOUCH. HA HA."

01:59.650 --> 02:04.155
I'M GLAD HE DIED.
(snores)

02:04.155 --> 02:05.756
NO, NO, NO. THE SLUMBER PARTY'S
JUST STARTING.
(pats arm)

02:05.756 --> 02:07.498
COME ON, DUDE.

02:07.498 --> 02:09.730
HEY. COME ON.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.262
OHH.

02:11.262 --> 02:14.465
STUPID PAINKILLERS.

02:14.465 --> 02:16.667
UH...

02:16.667 --> 02:19.210
WHAT?

02:19.210 --> 02:20.771
I DIDN'T SLEEP.

02:20.771 --> 02:23.574
IT'S STILL LAST NIGHT
FOR ME. I CAN DRINK.

02:23.574 --> 02:26.647
ANNA NICOLE SMITH LIVED
AND DIED BY THAT RULE.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.380
HONEY, IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP,
JUST TAKE A SLEEPING PILL.

02:29.380 --> 02:30.851
I'M NOT A FAN
OF TAKING DRUGS LIKE THAT.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.853
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO
HAVE TO SELF-MEDICATE,

02:32.853 --> 02:35.486
THEY'RE PROBABLY JUST HIDING
FROM A BIGGER ISSUE.

02:35.486 --> 02:37.258
HMM.
PROBABLY.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.789
PLUS, I JUST DON'T LIKE
THE IDEA

02:38.789 --> 02:40.631
OF ALTERING MY BRAIN.

02:40.631 --> 02:42.663
I LIKE TO STAY SHARP.
(chuckles)
(Ellie) YEAH.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.595
OH, GOD. (laughs)

02:44.595 --> 02:47.238
THESE HEELS ARE TRICKY.

02:47.238 --> 02:48.569
(chuckles)
OHH.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.441
(Ellie and Laurie both gasp)

02:50.441 --> 02:52.172
DON'T BE SELF-CONSCIOUS.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.644
YOU LOOK...

02:53.644 --> 02:54.945
MM.

02:54.945 --> 02:56.847
HELP ME OUT HERE, GUYS.

02:56.847 --> 02:58.249
NASTY.

02:58.249 --> 03:00.180
STEVE BUSCEMI.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.552
(muffled voice)
I LOVE YOU.

03:01.552 --> 03:03.584
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

03:03.584 --> 03:04.785
MM.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.458
OKAY. (chuckles)

03:07.458 --> 03:09.220
THE DOCTOR SAID WE CAN'T KISS
FOR A WEEK.

03:09.220 --> 03:10.861
SO WE HAVE TO HIGH FIVE.

03:10.861 --> 03:13.424
(door opens and closes)
VALENTINE'S DAY IS SCREWED.

03:13.424 --> 03:14.665
AT LEAST YOU'LL BE TOGETHER.

03:14.665 --> 03:16.797
I'LL BE ON MY iPad
WAITING FOR WADE.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.799
I MEAN, LITERALLY, I'M GONNA BE
SITTING ON MY iPad.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.872
I WANT IT TO BE THE FIRST THING
HE SEES WHEN HE LOGS ON.

03:21.872 --> 03:23.404
TWO YEARS AT WAR--

03:23.404 --> 03:24.975
THAT'LL BE THE IMAGE
THAT HAUNTS HIM.

03:24.975 --> 03:26.677
(scoffs)

03:26.677 --> 03:28.779
SHE PUT A LITTLE FOAM HEART
ON YOUR LATTE.

03:28.779 --> 03:31.612
WHY COULDN'T YOU SAY,
"THANKS FOR THE EXTRA EFFORT"?

03:31.612 --> 03:34.285
YEAH. THAT'S NOT REALLY
THE TYPE OF THING I SAY.

03:34.285 --> 03:35.546
THERE IS A FUN GAME--

03:35.546 --> 03:38.319
THINGS ELLIE
WOULD NEVER SAY.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.820
"I JUST WANT
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY."

03:39.820 --> 03:41.221
"TELL ME MORE
ABOUT YOUR KIDS."

03:41.221 --> 03:42.423
"I'LL HELP YOU MOVE."

03:42.423 --> 03:43.724
"I WOULD LOVE TO SEE
YOUR WEDDING VIDEO."

03:43.724 --> 03:45.596
"CAN I DRIVE YOU
TO THE AIRPORT?"

03:45.596 --> 03:47.428
"I'M WRONG."
"I DON'T MIND
WAITING IN LINE."

03:47.428 --> 03:48.899
"I LOVE VALENTINE'S DAY."

03:48.899 --> 03:50.301
YOU LOSE, JELLY.

03:50.301 --> 03:52.002
I DO LOVE VALENTINE'S DAY,

03:52.002 --> 03:54.805
'CAUSE ANDY ALWAYS GETS ME
THE MOST FABULOUS PRESENT.

03:54.805 --> 03:56.707
I GOT YOU SOMETHING
SO FANTASTIC THIS YEAR,

03:56.707 --> 03:58.409
MARK MY WORDS,
YOU'RE GONNA SAY,

03:58.409 --> 04:00.811
IT IS THE BEST GIFT
YOU HAVE EVER BEEN GIVEN.

04:00.811 --> 04:02.012
YAY!

04:02.012 --> 04:03.714
AND WHAT DO YOU GIVE HIM?

04:03.714 --> 04:05.946
I MEAN, OTHER THAN
HIS REALLY LOW SELF-ESTEEM.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.018
EVERY YEAR, I GIVE HIM
A SEX COUPON,

04:08.018 --> 04:10.881
WHICH HE CAN REDEEM
WHENEVER HE CHOOSES.

04:10.881 --> 04:13.754
LUCKILY FOR ME,
HE ALWAYS LOSES THEM.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.326
YEAH.

04:15.326 --> 04:18.258
OR DO I? POW.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.431
I'VE BEEN SAVING THESE UP
FOR TEN YEARS.

04:20.431 --> 04:21.962
YAY!

04:21.962 --> 04:24.595
I'M CASHING THEM ALL IN
OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS,

04:24.595 --> 04:28.969
CULMINATING IN A VALENTINE'S DAY
SEX-TRAVAGANZA.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.441
LOOK AT HER SHAKE.

04:30.441 --> 04:31.742
IT'S LIKE
WHEN YOUR FOSTER DAD

04:31.742 --> 04:33.504
GOES TO THE FRIDGE
FOR ANOTHER BEER,

04:33.504 --> 04:35.546
BUT YOU KNOW HE DRANK
THE LAST ONE TEN MINUTES AGO.

04:35.546 --> 04:37.047
WHOA.

04:37.047 --> 04:38.749
WE GOT A RUNNER.
(door opens, bells jingle)

04:38.749 --> 04:41.352
I KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES.

04:41.352 --> 04:44.385
WHAT YOU UP TO TONIGHT,
T-BONE?

04:44.385 --> 04:45.886
TRYING TO ROMANCE THIS GIRL

04:45.886 --> 04:47.758
I MET AT THE FILM SOCIETY
SCREENING OF "ALIEN."

04:47.758 --> 04:49.390
TOTAL SCI-FI CHICK.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.991
BUT I'M NOT SURE
IF SHE'S INTO ME,

04:50.991 --> 04:53.924
SO I'M GONNA TAKE A BIG SWING
AND ACTUALLY CREATE

04:53.924 --> 04:56.367
AN ALTERNATE GALAXY
IN MY APARTMENT.

04:56.367 --> 04:58.669
YOU KNOW, PUT PLANETS, STARS,
UP ON THE GREEN SCREEN.

04:58.669 --> 05:00.331
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

05:00.331 --> 05:01.732
THAT REMINDS ME OF THE TIME
I DID NONE OF THAT

05:01.732 --> 05:02.933
AND STILL GOT LAID.

05:02.933 --> 05:04.335
NICE FACE.

05:04.335 --> 05:06.076
(laughs) GEE. OOH.

05:06.076 --> 05:08.339
G-MAN, I WANT TO GIVE YOU
YOUR VALENTINE'S DAY GIFT EARLY.

05:08.339 --> 05:10.381
YOU KNOW, WHEN JULES ISN'T
SLEEPING, SHE CAN GET PISSY.

05:10.381 --> 05:13.484
SO I FIGURED
YOU COULD USE IT NOW.

05:13.484 --> 05:14.915
"THE JULES RULES"?

05:14.915 --> 05:16.647
IT'S A BOOK I COMPILED
OF TIPS AND HOW-TOs

05:16.647 --> 05:19.049
FOR HANDLING ANY SITUATION
WITH J-BIRD.

05:19.049 --> 05:20.691
YOU'VE GOT CHAPTERS IN HERE

05:20.691 --> 05:22.353
THAT WILL HELP YOU OUT
IF YOU FORGET HER BIRTHDAY

05:22.353 --> 05:23.694
OR IF YOU COME HOME LATE.

05:23.694 --> 05:25.426
HERE'S A LITTLE TASTE.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.057
"TIP 16--

05:27.057 --> 05:28.799
"IF JULES FLIES OFF THE HANDLE
FOR NO REASON,

05:28.799 --> 05:31.031
DISTRACT HER WITH SHOE TALK."

05:31.031 --> 05:32.903
"TIP NUMBER 37--

05:32.903 --> 05:35.706
"JULES THINKS DOGGY STYLE
IS A WAY OF PREPARING EGGS.

05:35.706 --> 05:37.608
"DO NOT CORRECT HER.

05:37.608 --> 05:38.939
IT IS FUNNY."

05:38.939 --> 05:40.741
WELL, THIS IS
VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.574
BUT I DIDN'T GET YOU ANYTHING
BECAUSE, WELL,

05:43.574 --> 05:46.677
MEN DON'T GET OTHER MEN
VALENTINE'S DAY GIFTS.

05:46.677 --> 05:49.119
BOBBY, THE SWEATER'S PERFECT.
I CAN'T STOP SMILING.

05:49.119 --> 05:51.582
(laughs) HAPPY V-DAY, BUDDY.

05:51.582 --> 05:53.484
AND I'M ALREADY USING
THE BATH OILS.

05:53.484 --> 05:56.356
(sniffs) OH.
SUMMER BREEZE.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.558
MM.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.530
OH, I CAN SMELL IT.
YEAH.

05:59.530 --> 06:02.463
HEY. I WAS WONDERING
WHERE YOU WENT.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.734
YOU FOUND ME.

06:03.734 --> 06:05.566
NOW YOU GO HIDE,
AND I'LL FIND YOU.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.898
JUST FOR THAT...

06:07.898 --> 06:11.402
WE'RE SITTING SIDESADDLE.

06:11.402 --> 06:13.904
SHE'LL TAKE THAT TO GO.

06:13.904 --> 06:15.876
IT'S SEX O'CLOCK.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.909
I GOT A BLANKET, SOME GATORADE,
AND A SHADY PARKING SPOT.

06:18.909 --> 06:20.150
OH, BUT I JUST HAD
A BOWL OF CHILI.

06:20.150 --> 06:22.613
YEAH, SO DID I.
LET'S GET CRAZY.

06:22.613 --> 06:24.785
WOW.

06:24.785 --> 06:28.889
ONE DOWN. NINE TO GO.
HAVE FUN.

06:28.889 --> 06:32.663
(sighs) I'M GOING TO CRUSH
SLEEP TONIGHT.

06:32.663 --> 06:35.726
I WAS THINKING HAVING SEX
MIGHT HELP, BUT...

06:35.726 --> 06:36.997
DOING IT WITHOUT KISSING

06:36.997 --> 06:38.398
JUST WOULD MAKE ME
FEEL LIKE A PRO,

06:38.398 --> 06:39.800
AND THAT DOES NOT RELAX ME.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.832
IT GETS ME ALL EXCITED.

06:41.832 --> 06:44.104
FILED AWAY
FOR A LATER DATE.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.637
WHERE'S MY EYE MASK?

06:46.637 --> 06:48.509
OH, GREAT.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.581
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
JUST PUT MY HAIR OVER MY EYES?

06:50.581 --> 06:52.643
OH, THIS STUPID HAIRCUT.

06:52.643 --> 06:54.815
(Bobby's voice) IF JULES
FLIES OFF THE HANDLE,

06:54.815 --> 06:56.146
DISTRACT HER WITH SHOE TALK.

06:56.146 --> 06:57.688
I REALLY LIKE
YOUR SLIPPERS.

06:57.688 --> 06:59.690
I KNOW, RIGHT?
(giggles)

06:59.690 --> 07:01.091
THEY LOOK LIKE SUEDE,
BUT NOPE.

07:01.091 --> 07:02.693
THEY'RE JUST TERRY CLOTH.

07:02.693 --> 07:04.725
OH, THEY'RE SO SOFT.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.528
OH. (laughs)

07:07.528 --> 07:09.099
(singsongy) FOUND IT.

07:09.099 --> 07:11.101
(normal voice)
AH. GOOD NIGHT, SWEETIE.

07:11.101 --> 07:14.104
MM.

07:14.104 --> 07:16.106
I MAY SLEEP FOREVER.

07:18.208 --> 07:20.871
(switch clicks)

07:20.871 --> 07:23.073
AHH.

07:32.182 --> 07:34.655
(switch clicks)
(gasps)

07:34.655 --> 07:35.886
OH, I'M SORRY.

07:35.886 --> 07:37.728
UH, SOMETIMES I JUST
COME HERE TO THINK.

07:37.728 --> 07:40.160
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?
I'LL JUMP RIGHT IN.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.932
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
INVENT A NEW SMELL

07:41.932 --> 07:43.794
OR--OR DO YOU THINK ALL
THE SMELLS ARE ALREADY OUT THERE

07:43.794 --> 07:46.466
AND WE JUST NEED
TO DISCOVER THEM?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.669
I WONDER WHO ELSE
IS AWAKE.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.200
ARE YOU READY FOR

07:50.200 --> 07:52.603
A CLOSE ENCOUNTER
OF THE TRAVIS KIND? (laughs)

07:52.603 --> 07:53.804
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

07:53.804 --> 07:55.746
MOM!

07:55.746 --> 07:57.848
OH, GOD! AAH!

07:57.848 --> 08:01.582
(strained voice) THESE
HARNESSES WERE A BAD IDEA.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.086
(laughs)

08:06.086 --> 08:07.217
YOU CANNOT
COME TO MY APARTMENT

08:07.217 --> 08:09.620
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.
YOU GOTTA GET SOME SLEEP.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.161
(laughs) SO...

08:11.161 --> 08:15.265
HE CREATED A WHOLE IMAGINARY
SPACE WORLD FOR HER?

08:15.265 --> 08:17.097
YEAH.
(door opens and closes)

08:17.097 --> 08:19.099
HIS PLAY DATES HAVEN'T CHANGED
MUCH SINCE HE WAS LITTLE.

08:19.099 --> 08:22.603
(cell phone chimes)
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S SO NICE TO BE ANYWHERE

08:22.603 --> 08:24.805
WITHOUT A CUBAN MAN
CLIMBING ALL OVER ME.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.176
(chuckles) BEEN THERE.

08:26.176 --> 08:27.578
WHEN?
(cell phone chimes)

08:27.578 --> 08:29.509
JULES, CAN I TELL YOU
WHY I THINK

08:29.509 --> 08:31.682
YOU SHOULD JUST GO AHEAD
AND TAKE A SLEEPING PILL?

08:31.682 --> 08:33.183
PLEASE. I CARE ABOUT
YOUR OPINION.

08:33.183 --> 08:35.586
(gasps) OH, THINGS THAT
ELLIE WOULD NEVER SAY.

08:35.586 --> 08:36.787
WELL PLAYED.
(chuckles)

08:36.787 --> 08:38.619
BOTTOM LINE,
THE PILLS WORK.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.692
SURE, SOMETIMES YOU DO
CRAZY STUFF WHILE YOU SLEEP.

08:41.692 --> 08:43.654
ONE TIME, I WOKE UP
ON A PLANE TO PHOENIX.

08:43.654 --> 08:45.295
BUT, YOU KNOW, I ROLLED WITH IT
AND LIVED THERE FOR A YEAR.

08:45.295 --> 08:47.127
IT REALLY IS A DRY HEAT.
REALLY?

08:47.127 --> 08:48.899
YEAH.
WOULD MY HAIR
LOOK PRETTY THERE?

08:48.899 --> 08:50.661
AMAZING.
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE A PILL!

08:50.661 --> 08:52.933
MY MOM IS VERY SUSCEPTIBLE
TO PEER PRESSURE. SHALL WE?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.534
YOU SHOULD TOTALLY TAKE IT.
DO IT.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.806
COME ON.
IT'S A LITTLE PILL.
DO IT.

08:55.806 --> 08:58.168
IT'S REALLY--
IT'S REALLY--

08:58.168 --> 09:00.310
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'LL MAKE YOU COOL.
WILL IT REALLY MAKE ME COOL?

09:00.310 --> 09:02.242
YES.
YEAH.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.874
(door opens and closes)
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TAKE ONE TONIGHT.

09:03.874 --> 09:06.116
THERE YOU ARE, MY LOVE.

09:06.116 --> 09:08.318
I'M HERE WITH ALL MY FRIENDS.

09:08.318 --> 09:09.720
COME ON.
IT'LL BE FUN.

09:09.720 --> 09:10.921
IT WON'T.

09:10.921 --> 09:12.122
YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE FUN.

09:12.122 --> 09:14.585
MM.

09:14.585 --> 09:16.727
HONEY, THE PHARMACY SAID
THAT MY SLEEPING PILLS

09:16.727 --> 09:18.659
WOULDN'T BE READY
FOR ANOTHER 20 MINUTES.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.090
SO COULD YOU PICK 'EM UP
FOR ME?

09:20.090 --> 09:21.992
SURE. BUT I DON'T NEED
YOUR INSURANCE CARD.

09:21.992 --> 09:24.234
I'LL JUST MEMORIZE
YOUR POLICY NUMBER.

09:24.234 --> 09:26.236
(chuckles) NEVER MIND.
I'LL GET 'EM MYSELF.

09:26.236 --> 09:28.338
BYE, GUYS.

09:28.338 --> 09:30.901
(chuckles) "TIP 103--

09:30.901 --> 09:33.043
"IF JULES ASKS YOU
TO DO A MENIAL TASK,

09:33.043 --> 09:34.675
"TELL HER SOMETHING
THAT MAKES HER THINK

09:34.675 --> 09:36.106
YOU'RE GONNA SCREW IT UP."
(laughs)

09:36.106 --> 09:38.679
THIS NOTEBOOK IS AMAZING,
BOBBY.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.250
I CAN ONLY EXPRESS
HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW

09:40.250 --> 09:41.952
BY USING A METAPHOR.

09:41.952 --> 09:43.654
YOU EVER MAKE A GIFT
FOR SOMEBODY,

09:43.654 --> 09:45.315
AND THEY JUST LOVE IT?

09:45.315 --> 09:48.989
NOT A METAPHOR, DAD.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.792
EVEN BETTER. ADIOS.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.263
I AM IMPRESSED, GRAYSON.

09:53.263 --> 09:55.165
MOST GUYS WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO ADMIT THAT

09:55.165 --> 09:56.997
THEY NEED ANOTHER MAN'S HELP
TO MAKE THEIR MARRIAGE WORK.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.298
WHAT?

09:58.298 --> 09:59.800
WHISKEY, PLEASE.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.271
I'M STARTING TO DESPISE
MY HUSBAND.

10:01.271 --> 10:03.273
WELL, HATE SEX CAN BE AWESOME.

10:03.273 --> 10:04.875
DID YOU LEARN THAT

10:04.875 --> 10:06.136
FROM EVERY GUY
WHO'S EVER SLEPT WITH YOU?

10:06.136 --> 10:07.738
(gasps)

10:07.738 --> 10:10.941
STILL GOT IT
EVEN THOUGH I'M DEAD INSIDE.

10:10.941 --> 10:12.282
(swallows) AH.

10:12.282 --> 10:14.084
(sighs)

10:14.084 --> 10:17.688
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GONNA TRY THIS.

10:17.688 --> 10:18.919
I MEAN, SHOULDN'T THE SHADES
BE DOWN?

10:18.919 --> 10:20.620
I MEAN, COPS CAN SEE IN HERE.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.223
IT'S A SLEEPING PILL,
JULES, NOT HEROIN.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.895
I TOTALLY RESPECT THAT
YOU THINK ABOUT

10:24.895 --> 10:26.797
WHAT A PILL IS BEFORE
YOU PUT IT IN YOUR BODY.

10:26.797 --> 10:28.659
I'VE NEVER DONE THAT.

10:33.303 --> 10:35.065
I FEEL WEIRD.

10:35.065 --> 10:37.207
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN ONE SECOND.

10:37.207 --> 10:40.170
DON'T MAKE FUN OF ME.
I'M NOT GOOD AT BEING A DRUGGIE.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.742
MM.

10:41.742 --> 10:45.676
SUDDENLY THIS WATER
TASTES AMAZING.

10:45.676 --> 10:48.779
AND CUE THE PARANOIA
IN THREE, TWO...

10:48.779 --> 10:51.922
WHY ARE YOU COUNTING DOWN?
WH-WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

10:51.922 --> 10:53.984
WHAT IF I CAN'T SLEEP?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.232
HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:02.232 --> 11:04.434
NO ONE WAS HERE,
SO I COOKED A CHICKEN.

11:04.434 --> 11:06.096
THOSE TWO THOUGHTS
DON'T CONNECT.

11:06.096 --> 11:08.939
THAT PILL KNOCKED JULES OUT.

11:08.939 --> 11:10.140
IF YOU READ THE CHAPTER
ON ROMANCE,

11:10.140 --> 11:11.341
THEN YOU KNOW
AFTER A LONG SLEEP,

11:11.341 --> 11:13.143
JULES CAN GET
A LITTLE RANDY.

11:13.143 --> 11:14.775
WOULD IT BE APPROPRIATE
TO TALK ABOUT THE POSITIONS

11:14.775 --> 11:15.976
THAT SHE ENJOYS?

11:15.976 --> 11:17.177
NO.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.378
UNDERSTOOD.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.880
IF YOU'RE CURIOUS LATER,

11:19.880 --> 11:21.081
THIS HERE'S
A STICK-FIGURE FLIP-BOOK

11:21.081 --> 11:24.054
I MADE OF HER FAVORITE MOVE.

11:24.054 --> 11:27.387
WHOO! LOOK AT HIM GO.
(laughs)

11:27.387 --> 11:29.790
I CAN HANDLE
MY OWN RELATIONSHIP.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.091
IN FACT,

11:31.091 --> 11:32.362
I DON'T NEED THIS.

11:32.362 --> 11:34.124
WELL, I JUST FIGURED
IT'D BE EASIER

11:34.124 --> 11:36.797
TO TAKE CARE OF THE CAR
IF YOU HAD THE MANUAL.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.829
YEAH, BUT, BOBBY, YOU WROTE
THAT WHILE YOU WERE MARRIED,

11:38.829 --> 11:41.101
AND THAT DIDN'T TURN OUT
SO GREAT, DID IT?

11:41.101 --> 11:43.473
(chuckles) SURE.

11:43.473 --> 11:46.276
NO PROBLEM.

11:48.478 --> 11:51.081
YOU HAVE, UH,
SOMETHING IN YOUR EAR.

11:51.081 --> 11:54.384
(gasps) OH. AND NOW...
(blows air) IT'S TWO.

11:54.384 --> 11:57.487
PLEASE NO. NO PART OF ME
IS GONNA ENJOY THIS.

11:57.487 --> 11:59.189
I'VE SHUT DOWN.

11:59.189 --> 12:02.292
SO YOU WILL BE HAVING SEX
WITH AN INANIMATE OBJECT

12:02.292 --> 12:04.855
THAT FEELS NOTHING
TOWARDS YOU.

12:04.855 --> 12:06.196
COOL. YOU WANNA GO
BEDROOM AGAIN

12:06.196 --> 12:07.758
OR YOU DO YOU WANNA TRY
THE COUCH?

12:10.130 --> 12:12.102
WOW.

12:12.102 --> 12:14.835
(doorbell rings)

12:14.835 --> 12:16.907
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:16.907 --> 12:19.169
HE'LL NEVER
LOOK FOR ME HERE.

12:19.169 --> 12:21.441
DUMMY.
(groans)

12:24.014 --> 12:28.018
I THINK I SLEPT, BUT I STILL
FEEL TOTALLY STRUNG OUT.

12:28.018 --> 12:30.450
ANYBODY IN THE MOOD
FOR SOME EGGS DOGGY STYLE?

12:30.450 --> 12:31.852
OHH.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.924
WHY DO YOU GUYS
ALL LOOK SO TIRED?

12:33.924 --> 12:36.156
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
FROM LAST NIGHT, DO YOU?

12:36.156 --> 12:39.329
NO. WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL...

12:48.238 --> 12:49.499
JULES?

12:56.006 --> 12:57.377
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:57.377 --> 13:01.311
I'M TRYING TO CLOSE...
THE TOMATO CAGE.

13:01.311 --> 13:03.013
MMM.

13:03.013 --> 13:05.115
(mouth full) PEANUT BUTTER?
NO.

13:06.917 --> 13:08.118
(grunts)

13:08.118 --> 13:10.160
OW.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.822
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:11.822 --> 13:13.793
IT'S, LIKE, 3:00 A.M.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.896
THE OCEAN IS SO PRETTY TODAY.

13:15.896 --> 13:19.369
HEY! TAKE OFF YOUR BIKINI,
AND LET'S DO IT IN THE SAND.

13:19.369 --> 13:22.102
NONE OF US SLEPT AT ALL.

13:22.102 --> 13:25.836
OH, MY GOD.
I AM SO SORRY.

13:25.836 --> 13:28.078
YOU DIDN'T HAVE SEX
WITH ME, DID YOU?

13:28.078 --> 13:29.279
NO.

13:29.279 --> 13:30.580
OKAY. (clicks tongue)

13:30.580 --> 13:31.982
(mouths words)

13:44.054 --> 13:45.896
NO, NO, NO.
MORE HERKY-JERKY.

13:45.896 --> 13:47.227
PLUS, YOU GOTTA MAKE A FACE

13:47.227 --> 13:48.959
LIKE YOU GOT HIT
WITH A SHOVEL.

13:52.863 --> 13:54.204
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

13:54.204 --> 13:55.866
WELL, OF COURSE
IT'S NOT FUNNY, JULES.

13:55.866 --> 13:58.368
IT'S THE TOMATO CAGE DANCE.

13:58.368 --> 14:00.840
SLEEPING PILLS ARE OUT,
BUT I'VE GOTTA GET SOME SLEEP.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.973
I MEAN, LOOK AT MY HANDS.

14:02.973 --> 14:04.314
THEY AREN'T SHAKING.

14:04.314 --> 14:06.076
I SAID LOOK AT MY HANDS.

14:06.076 --> 14:08.478
THEY'RE THE HANDS OF
A 90-YEAR-OLD BRICKLAYER.

14:08.478 --> 14:09.880
BUT YOUR HANDS ALWAYS
LOOK LIKE--

14:09.880 --> 14:11.081
DON'T FINISH THAT SENTENCE.

14:11.081 --> 14:13.053
MY HANDS LOOK OLD

14:13.053 --> 14:14.524
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SLEPT.

14:14.524 --> 14:16.486
YES. YES, YES, YES.
YEAH. UH-HUH. SURE. YEAH.

14:16.486 --> 14:18.929
SLEEPY HANDS.

14:18.929 --> 14:21.431
I GOTTA GO TO WORK, BABE.

14:21.431 --> 14:23.093
MM.

14:23.093 --> 14:24.294
LOVE YOU.

14:24.294 --> 14:26.096
LOVE YOU.

14:26.096 --> 14:27.297
AND IT SEEMS MY WIFE
HAS RUN AWAY.

14:27.297 --> 14:29.869
NO, NO, NO.
YOU AND TOM ARE STAYING.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.201
YOU'RE MY THINK TANK.
(door opens and closes)

14:31.201 --> 14:34.104
HOW CAN I GET SOME SLEEP?
GO.

14:34.104 --> 14:35.305
MEDITATION.

14:35.305 --> 14:36.576
DUMB. NEXT.
HOT TEA.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.448
HOT TEA?

14:38.448 --> 14:41.051
WHAT, YOU'RE BRINGING THAT
WEAK-ASS CRAP TO THE TABLE?

14:41.051 --> 14:42.312
READ A GOOD BOOK.

14:42.312 --> 14:43.513
HAVE WE MET?

14:43.513 --> 14:45.215
IF I REALLY NEED TO CRASH,

14:45.215 --> 14:47.357
SOMETIMES THE BEST THING
IS, UH, ANGRY, AGGRESSIVE--

14:47.357 --> 14:50.020
LET'S CALL IT SELF-LOVE.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.362
LOOKS LIKE TOM
BLEW UP THE THINK TANK.

14:52.362 --> 14:54.364
(sighs)

14:56.266 --> 14:59.429
HEY, WHY'D YOU GIVE MY DAD
HIS GIFT BACK?

14:59.429 --> 15:01.631
I DON'T NEED HIM TELLING ME
HOW TO HANDLE MY RELATIONSHIP,

15:01.631 --> 15:05.035
GIVING ME STUPID
STICK-FIGURE FLIP-BOOKS.

15:05.035 --> 15:06.376
THOSE FLIP-BOOKS ARE HOW
HE TEACHES PEOPLE THINGS.

15:06.376 --> 15:07.907
I MEAN, I STILL HAVE
THE ONE HE USED

15:07.907 --> 15:09.439
TO SHOW ME
HOW TO PUT ON A CONDOM.

15:09.439 --> 15:10.941
I GOT MY OWN PROBLEMS.

15:10.941 --> 15:12.542
LIKE, LOOK, IF MY FACE
DOESN'T HEAL UP,

15:12.542 --> 15:14.514
I'M GONNA HAVE TO WORK
ON MY PERSONALITY.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.146
BUMMER.
NO KIDDING.

15:16.146 --> 15:18.318
SO FORGIVE ME IF I DON'T WANT
A BOOK THAT YOUR DAD

15:18.318 --> 15:20.590
WROTE ABOUT JULES
WHILE THEY WERE MARRIED.
YOU DON'T GET IT.

15:20.590 --> 15:22.452
HE DIDN'T WRITE IT
WHILE THEY WERE STILL TOGETHER.

15:22.452 --> 15:23.994
HE WROTE IT AFTER THEY SPLIT

15:23.994 --> 15:25.325
SO IF HE EVER GOT
A SECOND CHANCE,

15:25.325 --> 15:27.057
HE WOULDN'T SCREW IT UP AGAIN.

15:27.057 --> 15:29.399
I DIDN'T THINK HE'D EVER
GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE,

15:29.399 --> 15:31.401
BUT HE MUST...
THINK OF YOU

15:31.401 --> 15:33.633
AS A REALLY CLOSE FRIEND.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.511
JELLY, YOUR DVR
HAS NOTHING ON IT

15:41.511 --> 15:44.274
EXCEPT REALITY SHOWS
ABOUT CUPCAKE CONTESTS

15:44.274 --> 15:47.647
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO FAT
TO LEAVE THEIR HOUSE.

15:47.647 --> 15:51.451
YOU KNOW THERE'S ACTUALLY
A SHOW THAT'S ABOUT BOTH?

15:51.451 --> 15:54.084
IT'S CALLED "FATTY CAKES,"
AND AT THE END,

15:54.084 --> 15:57.457
THE WINNER GETS AIRLIFTED
TO HER NEW BAKERY.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.589
HOLY CRAP.
I HAVE TO SEE THAT.

15:59.589 --> 16:02.032
NOT THAT I DON'T LOVE
HAVING YOU HERE. I DON'T.

16:02.032 --> 16:04.734
BUT WHY CAN'T YOU
GO HOME TO ANDY?

16:04.734 --> 16:06.536
WE'VE ALREADY HAD SEX
FOUR TIMES

16:06.536 --> 16:08.738
IN THE LAST DAY AND A HALF.

16:08.738 --> 16:10.540
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT'S A BLAST,

16:10.540 --> 16:12.672
JUST HAVING SEX
OVER AND OVER AND OVER

16:12.672 --> 16:14.704
TO MAKE YOUR MAN HAPPY?

16:14.704 --> 16:16.276
I DON'T.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.608
BUT IN MY DEFENSE,
I HAD A DAD WHO LOVED ME.

16:18.608 --> 16:21.481
I JUST THINK IT'S AMAZING
THAT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS

16:21.481 --> 16:24.184
ANDY STILL WANTS TO
GRIND NASTIES ALL THE TIME.

16:24.184 --> 16:27.287
YOU KNOW, I REALLY HOPE
THAT I HAVE THAT SOMEDAY.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.059
WELL, THANKS, JELLY.

16:29.059 --> 16:30.620
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

16:30.620 --> 16:33.123
(gasps)
THINGS ELLIE WOULD NEVER SAY.

16:33.123 --> 16:34.694
THAT MIGHT BE
THE BEST ONE YET.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.126
ALL RIGHT.

16:36.126 --> 16:37.527
PREPARE TO CRY.

16:37.527 --> 16:39.169
(gasps)

16:39.169 --> 16:40.670
(whispers) "FATTY CAKES."

16:40.670 --> 16:42.772
OHH. WHAT THE...

16:44.274 --> 16:46.176
MNH-MNH.
OH.

16:46.176 --> 16:48.578
I'M SO SICK OF NOT BEING ABLE
TO KISS YOU.

16:48.578 --> 16:50.240
WELL, IF YOU
CAN'T SLEEP TONIGHT,

16:50.240 --> 16:52.512
JUST WAKE ME UP,
AND I'LL KEEP YOU COMPANY.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.144
NO NEED.

16:54.144 --> 16:56.216
I'VE DECIDED TO EMBRACE
NOT BEING ABLE TO SLEEP.

16:56.216 --> 16:59.749
I CAN FINISH MY WORK,
EXERCISE MORE.

16:59.749 --> 17:02.152
WELL, I HOPE YOU
GET SOME SLEEP TONIGHT.

17:02.152 --> 17:05.225
I DON'T.
I'M DOUBLING DOWN ON LIFE. HMM.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.456
(mutters)
OHH.

17:08.558 --> 17:11.661
MM.
(switch clicks)

17:11.661 --> 17:15.465
(Ed Sheeran's "Give Me Love"
playing)

17:19.139 --> 17:21.371
HEY.
HEY.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.080
IT'S FOUR BEDROOMS,
THREE BATHS,

17:30.080 --> 17:32.352
AND YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY
SEE IT BEFORE ANYONE ELSE DOES.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.625
OH. IT'S, UH, 4:15.

17:35.625 --> 17:37.587
OH.

17:37.587 --> 17:39.159

17:39.159 --> 17:41.291

17:52.772 --> 17:55.205

18:16.566 --> 18:20.170
WHO'S AS CRAZY FOR ME NOW

18:23.133 --> 18:26.506
DO YOU HAVE TO GO TO WORK?
SHOULD WE RUN UPSTAIRS?

18:26.506 --> 18:28.107
WELL, IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY,

18:28.107 --> 18:30.610
SO WHY DON'T YOU OPEN

18:30.610 --> 18:31.881
OH.

18:31.881 --> 18:33.343

18:33.343 --> 18:34.544

18:43.523 --> 18:45.625

18:45.625 --> 18:47.427
(laughs)

18:47.427 --> 18:50.330

18:50.330 --> 18:51.831
YEAH.

18:56.206 --> 18:57.567
HEY.

18:57.567 --> 18:59.169
(mouth full) HEY, MAN.

18:59.169 --> 19:00.810
AHH.

19:00.810 --> 19:02.912
I BROUGHT SOME BEERS IF YOU
WANT TO WASH DOWN THAT CHICKEN.

19:02.912 --> 19:04.744
OH, THANKS, MAN, BUT...

19:04.744 --> 19:06.716
I ALREADY WASHED IT DOWN
AFTER I DROPPED IT

19:06.716 --> 19:08.147
CLIMBING UP THE LADDER.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.349
YOU WANT A WING?

19:09.349 --> 19:11.150

19:15.325 --> 19:16.856

19:16.856 --> 19:18.688
(exhales) YOU KNOW,
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF GUYS

19:18.688 --> 19:20.430
THAT COULD WATCH
ONE OF THEIR BEST FRIENDS

19:20.430 --> 19:24.163
MARRY THEIR EX-WIFE
AND BE SO COOL ABOUT IT.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.696
YEAH, I GUESS.

19:26.696 --> 19:28.668
WHY ARE YOU
SAYING THIS NOW?

19:28.668 --> 19:31.701
I JUST REALIZED,
I NEVER THANKED YOU FOR IT.

19:31.701 --> 19:33.943
THANKS.

19:33.943 --> 19:35.745
YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:35.745 --> 19:37.347

в™Є MY, MY в™Є

19:39.209 --> 19:41.511
MM.

19:41.511 --> 19:44.314
WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
IN HERE THAT COULD HELP.

19:44.314 --> 19:46.556
TURN TO THE LAST PAGE.

19:46.556 --> 19:48.288
THIS MAY SOUND LIKE
A FAIRY TALE,

19:48.288 --> 19:49.689
BUT WITH JULES,

19:49.689 --> 19:52.362
WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS...

19:52.362 --> 19:56.426
YOU CAN FIX ALMOST ANYTHING
WITH A GOOD KISS.

19:56.426 --> 19:57.827
STILL CAN'T SLEEP, BABE?

19:57.827 --> 19:59.469
NO.

19:59.469 --> 20:01.271
I KNOW IT'S STUPID,
BUT THE WHOLE THING

20:01.271 --> 20:03.933

FEEL SAD, YOU KNOW?

20:03.933 --> 20:06.236
