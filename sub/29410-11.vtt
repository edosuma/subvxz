12:18.999 --> 12:20.217
[clears throat]

12:20.261 --> 12:21.741
[sighs]

12:21.784 --> 12:24.787
Uh, have they, um...

12:24.831 --> 12:26.789
have they named him yet?

12:27.921 --> 12:29.183
The Junkyard Killer.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.924
I need to know where you went...

12:30.967 --> 12:33.970
I'm sorry-- The Junkyard Killer?

12:34.884 --> 12:36.756
Yikes.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.758
When I said you needed to talk,
this is not what I meant.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.760
Forgive me.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.674
You probably need help with a...

12:42.718 --> 12:43.937
a profile.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.765
Well, uh...

12:45.808 --> 12:47.810
The junkyard was a mislead,
of course.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.769
John hated
getting his hands dirty.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.119
I mean, for a man
who once took his pleasure

12:52.162 --> 12:55.426
with human cadavers,
he was fastidious.

12:55.470 --> 12:58.429
I don't need a profile,
I need location specifics.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.780
Of course, profiling is more
Malcolm's thing.

13:00.823 --> 13:03.173
Isn't it? Is Malcolm
listening to this conversation?

13:03.217 --> 13:04.784
You-you wired up?

13:04.827 --> 13:08.091
-Hello! My boy!
-Where did you go with Watkins?

13:08.135 --> 13:09.963
We need to find
his killing grounds.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.008
I understand, we've...

13:12.052 --> 13:14.358
we've been, uh, you know,
through some stuff,

13:14.402 --> 13:17.535
but I-I... I can still help you.
And your sister.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.711
I mean, your mom's
probably a harder sell.

13:19.755 --> 13:22.062
-Where is my boy?
-You don't get to choose
who questions you.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.672
No, but I can choose
who gets the answers.

13:23.715 --> 13:26.327
Where is my...

13:26.370 --> 13:28.111
boy?

13:31.593 --> 13:32.942
John Watkins has him.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.335
No.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.076
He... No.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.817
I need your help, Dr. Whitly.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.514
Roughly 12 hours ago,
Malcolm was kidnapped

13:39.557 --> 13:41.864
by Watkins.
We don't know where he is.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.823
He's... If John has him,
he's dead. He's dead.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.520
Focus.
We are running out of time.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.870
No, there's no time.
It's over, my son is gone.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.177
[gasping]

13:51.743 --> 13:53.833
Mr. David, get medical!

13:53.876 --> 13:54.877
Medic!

13:54.921 --> 13:56.183
[gasping continues]

13:59.229 --> 14:00.535
I need him conscious.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.234
So...

14:04.278 --> 14:06.236
should we talk about the past?

14:08.021 --> 14:09.718
Everybody needs a good knife.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.028
You want to talk about the past?

14:15.071 --> 14:17.682
I had a good look at yours.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.684
The way your grandparents
raised you.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.469
All the punishments.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.645
Fire and brimstone.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.734
The wardrobe
where they kept you.

14:25.777 --> 14:28.519
I saw the scratches
on the door.

14:28.563 --> 14:29.912
Nobody deserves that.

14:29.956 --> 14:33.481
I-I... was a difficult child.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.875
Is that why you
had to kill your grandfather?

14:35.918 --> 14:37.789
I saved him.

14:39.313 --> 14:41.184
And I made sure it was quick.

14:41.228 --> 14:42.925
He was working on his car.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.796
You kicked out the jack.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.843
He was your first.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.759
You crushed him,
then started on the others.

14:50.802 --> 14:53.022
Ah, you got me all figured out.

14:53.066 --> 14:56.634
That's how I know
you weren't born this way.

14:56.678 --> 14:59.376
You're a product of that home.

14:59.420 --> 15:01.248
Which means you can change.

15:01.291 --> 15:04.077
You can evolve.
This is a sickness.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.426
It's my calling!

15:06.296 --> 15:09.909
I am a savior.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.215
No.

15:12.259 --> 15:14.826
You torture and kill addicts
and prostitutes

15:14.870 --> 15:16.611
because that's what
your mother was.

15:16.654 --> 15:19.744
You loved her, and she left,

15:19.788 --> 15:22.747
and you grew up
with grandparents

15:22.791 --> 15:24.880
who drilled hate into you.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.058
You think you're
an original, John.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.321
But really, you're chapter one

15:31.365 --> 15:32.757
in the first profiling book

15:32.801 --> 15:34.455
they give new recruits
at Quantico.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.674
At least I remember my past.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.241
What made me who I am.

15:38.285 --> 15:41.244
You don't even know who you are.

15:42.680 --> 15:46.119
You don't remember
what made you.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.950
It all started right here.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.824
Then help me remember.

15:55.867 --> 15:58.479
We went on a camping trip.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.394
The girl who I found--
she was there, too, right?

16:00.437 --> 16:04.311
Aw, the girl.
That's all you care about!

16:04.354 --> 16:06.443
Your father
took care of her himself.

16:06.487 --> 16:09.664
Guess she was special.

16:09.707 --> 16:11.361
But that doesn't matter.

16:11.405 --> 16:13.929
This is about you...

16:13.973 --> 16:15.191
and me.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.673
And this.

16:21.589 --> 16:22.982
Aah!

16:31.033 --> 16:32.687
You stabbed me

16:32.730 --> 16:35.037
and left me for dead.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.473
I lived.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.562
Will you?

16:38.606 --> 16:39.607
[gasps]

16:51.619 --> 16:54.013
The powers that be love
everything you've done so far.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.058
Your ratings were
through the roof.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.712
And searches for
hot serial killers

16:57.755 --> 17:00.410
-went up over 2,000%.
-Oh, that's so gross.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.325
I know. I mean,

17:02.369 --> 17:05.024
after a bottle of pinot, I may
have searched for that, too.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.026
But I hate myself, so...

17:07.069 --> 17:08.549
-[chuckles]
-Ainsley...

17:08.592 --> 17:11.073
I'm the only top news producer
in New York

17:11.117 --> 17:13.032
who hasn't been me-too'd
off to the Hamptons,

17:13.075 --> 17:15.382
and I want to help you craft
your follow-up interview.

17:15.425 --> 17:17.514
There's talk of it airing
after the Super Bowl.

17:17.558 --> 17:20.343
Yeah, well, he's in solitary,
so even if he wanted to talk...

17:20.387 --> 17:22.084
He can't.
Got it.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.651
Leslie, I was really hoping

17:23.694 --> 17:25.348
that any follow-up
would focus more on his victims

17:25.392 --> 17:27.176
-and their families.
-Sounds like a snooze fest.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.396
Stop. I just really think
that it would be...

17:29.439 --> 17:31.311
-[phone dings]
-Uh...

17:33.574 --> 17:35.489
LESLIE:
Looks important.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.752
-Maybe it's an exclusive.
-Last time my mother used 911,

17:37.795 --> 17:39.580
-it was about a sample sale.
-[phone dings]

17:43.714 --> 17:46.369
She said "please."
That's a first.

17:46.413 --> 17:47.805
Then go.
I'll tell the suits

17:47.849 --> 17:49.198
you had a family emergency.

17:49.242 --> 17:51.679
I'll be overly vague.
They'll love it.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.072
Go.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.943
-You only get one family.
-Hmm.

17:54.986 --> 17:58.773
Yeah.
Mine's more than enough.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.104
"I can create a place
of peace and safety

18:25.147 --> 18:27.454
no matter where I am."
"I can create a place

18:27.497 --> 18:30.370
of peace and safety
no matter where I am."

18:31.458 --> 18:33.155
That's right.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.592
Do your daily affirmations...

18:35.636 --> 18:38.117
just like I taught you.

18:42.643 --> 18:46.951
BRIGHT:
You're not really here.

18:46.995 --> 18:48.779
GABRIELLE:
And you're not really in a place

18:48.823 --> 18:50.868
of peace and safety.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.176
Now.
[echoes]: Now.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.699
Collect your thoughts.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.266
The more you breathe,

18:57.310 --> 18:59.921
the more ordered
those thoughts will be.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.577
You have to stay alive, kiddo.

19:03.620 --> 19:06.232
I'm losing a lot of blood.

19:06.275 --> 19:09.191
Everything you need to fix that
is right here.

19:09.235 --> 19:12.847
First priority:
stop the bleeding.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.697
That's better.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.526
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.963
Of course you do.

19:42.006 --> 19:44.183
You're a stress-induced
hallucination.

19:44.226 --> 19:47.490
[chuckles]
Look at Mr. Know-it-all.

19:47.534 --> 19:50.189
You think Watkins
is going to shed a light

19:50.232 --> 19:52.495
on the girl in the box,
is that it?

19:52.539 --> 19:54.628
Solve all your problems.

19:54.671 --> 19:57.848
He can tell me about her.

19:57.892 --> 20:01.417
Let her go. Stop tying
your traumas up into her.

20:01.461 --> 20:04.899
She's not the reason
you're like this.

20:04.942 --> 20:07.554
We know why you're like this.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.730
Watkins doesn't matter.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.514
Watkins can help me.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.864
He can kill you.

20:13.908 --> 20:16.040
He almost has.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.651
Stop trying to profile

20:17.694 --> 20:18.956
and, for once in your life,

20:19.000 --> 20:20.567
protect yourself.

20:20.610 --> 20:23.047
Where are you, Malcolm?

20:23.091 --> 20:25.093
Where are you
right now?

20:26.747 --> 20:28.270
It all started right here.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.272
[echoing]:
Right here. Right here.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.188
Where it all started.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.756
The camping trip.

20:35.799 --> 20:38.106
That's where I stabbed him.

20:38.149 --> 20:40.804
That's where he's holding me.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.591
I'm his origin story.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.899
But why would I try
and kill him?

20:48.943 --> 20:50.988
You think I'd remember that.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.555
We've been through this.

20:52.599 --> 20:55.123
You can't force the memories
to come, Malcolm.

20:55.166 --> 20:58.605
You need to focus
on your own survival.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.868
What's the point
of knowing the answers

21:00.911 --> 21:03.087
if you're dead?

21:03.131 --> 21:05.438
I can't do this alone.

21:06.526 --> 21:07.831
Come back.

21:11.139 --> 21:13.141
I've got local law enforcement

21:13.184 --> 21:15.926
doing targeted vehicle checks
all over the tristate area,

21:15.970 --> 21:18.451
an army of techs
combing through CCTV footage

21:18.494 --> 21:20.801
and forensics teams
at the Watkins house,

21:20.844 --> 21:23.369
and you want to go camping?

21:23.412 --> 21:25.284
Bright is one of us,
and he's out there.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.329
We believe this cabin is
an important place for Watkins

21:27.373 --> 21:29.592
and, in a way, for Bright.

21:29.636 --> 21:30.898
I'm afraid I don't follow.

21:30.941 --> 21:32.769
We know that
when Bright was a kid,

21:32.813 --> 21:34.858
he went camping
with his dad and another man.

21:34.902 --> 21:37.121
He thinks that
that might have been Watkins.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.428
-Bright met Watkins as a kid?
-JT: Yeah.

21:39.472 --> 21:40.908
On a trip to this cabin.

21:40.951 --> 21:42.388
Don't you see--

21:42.431 --> 21:44.477
Watkins is taking Bright
back to the beginning.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.612
Okay.

21:49.656 --> 21:51.658
Let's go.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.442
You're... coming along?

21:53.486 --> 21:55.575
How many hours of hostage
recovery and extraction

21:55.618 --> 21:57.316
do you two have under your belt?

21:57.359 --> 21:58.665
Let's go.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.279
Copy that, JT.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.803
I'll get it out of him.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.936
This will help, Dr. Whitly.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.938
[inhales]

22:10.981 --> 22:14.768
Oh, benzodiazepines,
my old friend.

22:14.811 --> 22:17.118
Thank you, Omar.

22:18.162 --> 22:19.990
Thank you, Mr. David.

22:20.034 --> 22:21.340
Martin?

22:21.383 --> 22:23.472
Martin, I don't have
a lot of time

22:23.516 --> 22:25.344
and neither does Malcolm.

22:25.387 --> 22:28.651
Was there a cabin
that you visited with Watkins?

22:28.695 --> 22:30.436
You still think Malcolm's alive?

22:31.915 --> 22:34.527
Omar, we may need some benzos

22:34.570 --> 22:36.093
for my friend here.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.140
It's over.

22:39.183 --> 22:40.663
No.
Malcolm's a gutsy kid

22:40.707 --> 22:42.839
with one of the sharpest minds
I've ever known.

22:42.883 --> 22:45.494
You might not have any faith
in him, but I do.

22:45.538 --> 22:49.411
How you yearn for it.

22:49.455 --> 22:51.500
To be his father.

22:51.544 --> 22:54.460
That's why you brought him
into the NYPD, right?

22:54.503 --> 22:56.723
Cared for him?

22:56.766 --> 22:58.638
Huh?

22:58.681 --> 23:00.727
I did a hell of a lot more
for him than you ever did.

23:00.770 --> 23:03.730
Well, you certainly
got him killed.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.601
And, oh,
if you'd been a good boy

23:05.645 --> 23:07.298
and drank up your cup of tea
that night,

23:07.342 --> 23:08.865
Malcolm would still be alive.

23:08.909 --> 23:11.215
He's not dead.

23:11.259 --> 23:14.567
Well, if you knew John Watkins
like I do...

23:14.610 --> 23:16.395
you'd think otherwise.

23:16.438 --> 23:19.006
I owe Malcolm my life.
I'm not giving up on him.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.268
Oh, yeah,

23:20.311 --> 23:22.357
you two got a real bond.

23:24.925 --> 23:28.015
What else did you do
to try to replace me?

23:29.930 --> 23:32.846
I smelled my wife's perfume
on that...

23:32.889 --> 23:34.891
cheap coat.

23:34.935 --> 23:38.895
You're not worthy
of a woman like her.

23:38.939 --> 23:41.855
She must have
felt sorry for you.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.900
Or angry at me.

23:45.772 --> 23:47.774
Focus on the cabin.

23:49.297 --> 23:51.604
Watkins could have
taken Bright there,

23:51.647 --> 23:53.475
and he's smart enough
to stay alive.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.781
You know that.

24:00.308 --> 24:02.919
Well, that's-that's true.

24:02.963 --> 24:05.618
I mean, Malcolm is...

24:05.661 --> 24:07.271
resourceful, after all.

24:07.315 --> 24:09.230
-He is.
-Yeah.

24:09.273 --> 24:12.886
He is. Now, where
would John hold him?

24:12.929 --> 24:14.888
Um...

24:14.931 --> 24:16.890
there was a...

24:16.933 --> 24:19.675
a rather deep cellar
at that property.

24:21.764 --> 24:24.114
Get me a pen and I'll...

24:24.158 --> 24:26.203
I'll draw you a map.

24:31.861 --> 24:34.124
Hurts like a son of a bitch,
doesn't it?

24:34.168 --> 24:36.344
Yeah.

24:37.432 --> 24:39.434
Oh, I know.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.654
I floated down a river
like that,

24:41.697 --> 24:44.483
fixed myself up with
a rusty fish hook

24:44.526 --> 24:46.180
-and some line.
-[whooshing in distance]

24:46.223 --> 24:48.835
That's what I'm hearing.

24:48.878 --> 24:51.490
The river.

24:51.533 --> 24:54.318
Could have used a surgeon
that day, but he was...

24:54.362 --> 24:56.451
less than helpful.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.670
Why did I do it?

24:59.106 --> 25:00.803
You don't remember the fight?

25:04.024 --> 25:05.852
We were supposed
to do this together.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.691
You and my dad
were gonna kill somebody.

25:20.475 --> 25:21.650
The girl.

25:21.694 --> 25:24.653
I tried to save her, didn't I?

25:24.697 --> 25:26.307
You got a hell
of a hero complex.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.614
Stop asking about the girl.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.572
Then tell me why I stabbed you.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.574
It was self-defense.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.533
And the chloroform

25:34.576 --> 25:36.883
wasn't working
as well as it once did.

25:36.926 --> 25:40.408
You were starting
to remember things.

25:40.451 --> 25:42.236
We brought you
on that camping trip

25:42.279 --> 25:46.240
to take care of you for good.
[sighs]

25:46.283 --> 25:47.894
Your father was going
to kill you.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.596
AINSLEY:
Hello?

25:55.641 --> 25:56.816
Mom?

26:01.908 --> 26:03.518
[footsteps approaching]

26:05.041 --> 26:07.391
What's going on?
What's all this?

26:11.265 --> 26:13.267
Your brother is missing.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.880
Missing?

26:17.924 --> 26:19.882
Taken...

26:19.926 --> 26:21.884
they think,
by The Junkyard Killer.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.886
I... I don't understand.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.584
He's been kidnapped?

26:25.627 --> 26:28.499
How is that possible?

26:28.543 --> 26:32.242
It is possible because you
and your brother have made it

26:32.286 --> 26:33.679
your livelihoods to obsess

26:33.722 --> 26:36.595
-over your father's past.
-Stop.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.248
Is that really
why you asked me here?

26:38.292 --> 26:41.121
No. But I can't just
sit here alone,

26:41.164 --> 26:42.992
wondering if he's ever
going to come back.

26:43.036 --> 26:45.604
-God, hug me, for God's sake.
-Um... uh...

26:48.868 --> 26:51.000
Um...

26:51.044 --> 26:52.436
it's okay.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.743
I mean...
[exhales]

26:54.787 --> 26:57.616
It's not okay, but...

26:57.659 --> 26:59.748
it will be.

26:59.792 --> 27:03.056
Malcolm has been trained
by the FBI.

27:03.099 --> 27:04.927
He confronts monsters
like this every day.

27:04.971 --> 27:06.799
Oh, don't tell me that.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.281
But thank you.

27:11.325 --> 27:14.241
So... what are these?

27:15.938 --> 27:18.767
Pictures...

27:18.811 --> 27:21.117
from The Killer's house.

27:21.161 --> 27:23.554
Gil wanted me
to look through them,

27:23.598 --> 27:25.774
see if I saw anything...
relevant.

27:25.818 --> 27:27.297
AINSLEY:
So they're desperate.

27:27.341 --> 27:29.343
-Maybe I can help.
-No.

27:29.386 --> 27:30.953
I promised Gil no press.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.781
That's not what I meant.

27:32.825 --> 27:35.828
I meant, I can help
by sitting here

27:35.871 --> 27:38.526
and going through
creepy photos with you.

27:38.569 --> 27:40.571
[sighs, groans]

27:44.358 --> 27:46.360
We will need bourbon.

28:08.730 --> 28:10.689
Oh, my God.

28:12.081 --> 28:13.735
Ainsley.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.998
JOHN:
You remember it all now,
don't you?

28:16.042 --> 28:18.392
My father's a lot of things, but
he would never kill his own son.

28:18.435 --> 28:20.873
Oh, he had every intention to.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.526
He just...

28:22.570 --> 28:24.703
lost his nerve
when we got up there.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.142
So you took things
into your own hands.

28:29.185 --> 28:31.448
Until...

28:31.492 --> 28:33.973
you became your father's son.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.845
Came at me like a feral animal.

28:36.889 --> 28:38.717
-I am not a killer.
-[chuckles]

28:38.760 --> 28:40.719
My scar says otherwise.

28:40.762 --> 28:43.243
Face it, you're just like me.

28:43.286 --> 28:45.201
You judge, you hunt.

28:45.245 --> 28:47.682
I bring criminals to justice.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.380
I protect my community
and my family.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.560
Of course.

28:56.604 --> 28:57.736
You share
your father's strengths,

28:57.779 --> 28:59.085
but you also share his weakness.

28:59.128 --> 29:00.956
What's that--

29:01.000 --> 29:03.611
his sadistic megalomania
or the dash of God Complex?

29:03.654 --> 29:05.439
Your family.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.921
It's here somewhere.
I know it.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.357
What is it?

29:10.400 --> 29:11.750
Mom, I need
to tell you something.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.752
-Now you're scaring me.
-Good.

29:13.795 --> 29:16.058
Do you remember Mr. Boots?

29:16.102 --> 29:17.103
-Your imaginary friend?
-Yes.

29:17.146 --> 29:18.931
What do you remember?

29:18.974 --> 29:20.367
You invented him right before
they took Martin away.

29:20.410 --> 29:21.803
The child psychologists--

29:21.847 --> 29:23.892
and believe me,
we had a fleet of them--

29:23.936 --> 29:27.069
said that it was perfectly
normal for a girl your age

29:27.113 --> 29:28.941
to have an imaginary friend,

29:28.984 --> 29:30.638
especially in a time of trauma.

29:30.681 --> 29:33.597
How can he be imaginary
if he gave me this?

29:33.641 --> 29:35.208
[sighs]
You're confused.

29:35.251 --> 29:36.818
That figurine
was from your father.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.820
It's one of the last things
he gave...

29:38.864 --> 29:40.213
An angel? No.

29:40.256 --> 29:42.128
Dad got me books on Marie Curie.

29:42.171 --> 29:44.086
This?

29:44.130 --> 29:46.959
This was from Mr. Boots.

29:47.002 --> 29:49.918
Just like Martin, you...

29:49.962 --> 29:52.268
love your family.

29:52.312 --> 29:54.314
It's your fatal flaw.

29:56.142 --> 29:59.449
Sacrifice will be
your final trial.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.843
But don't worry,
it won't be something

30:01.887 --> 30:03.627
you have to do,

30:03.671 --> 30:05.804
just something
you have to endure.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.332
I'll do the doing.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.486
No movement in the house.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.271
Gil said there's a cellar.
Could be underground.

30:38.314 --> 30:39.925
COLETTE:
We don't have eyes down there.

30:39.968 --> 30:41.491
Your men clear up top.
We're going underneath.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.189
Copy that.

30:43.232 --> 30:45.321
I'm primary.
We're going into a blind,

30:45.365 --> 30:47.323
so, Tarmel, you cover the rear.
Powell, where I'm not looking,

30:47.367 --> 30:50.457
-that's where you're looking.
-On it.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.372
BRIGHT:
No.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.330
Stop.
You don't have to do this.

30:54.374 --> 30:56.332
No, but I do. Mm.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.899
It's my calling.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.509
I know that voice.

30:59.553 --> 31:01.729
The one inside your head.

31:01.772 --> 31:04.384
Uh, maybe it started
with your grandfather

31:04.427 --> 31:07.474
saying you were worthless,
but it-but it evolved

31:07.517 --> 31:09.084
into something

31:09.128 --> 31:12.174
more powerful, undeniable.

31:12.218 --> 31:15.177
It will never be satisfied.

31:15.221 --> 31:17.745
And neither will you.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.371
-Clear.
-Clear.
-Clear.

31:35.415 --> 31:37.939
There's no sign of them.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.289
[on comms]:
Cabin's empty.

31:44.076 --> 31:47.209
Damn it, Bright, your skinny ass
better still be alive.

31:47.253 --> 31:50.212
I hear that voice, too.

31:50.256 --> 31:52.258
From my father.

31:54.173 --> 31:56.131
I can hear him.

31:56.175 --> 31:58.177
I can see him.

32:00.005 --> 32:02.355
But I don't
have to listen to him.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.400
So don't.

32:05.445 --> 32:08.927
Don't listen to the voice.

32:16.282 --> 32:18.893
The thing is...

32:18.937 --> 32:20.460
I like the voice.

32:21.635 --> 32:24.246
It's a part of me.

32:24.290 --> 32:26.074
And right now,

32:26.118 --> 32:28.076
it's telling me to hurry.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.254
Watkins, wait.

32:32.298 --> 32:34.691
Watkins!
Stop.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.013
DANI:
Room's clear.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.234
Damn it.

32:55.277 --> 32:56.844
AGENT:
All clear down here.

32:58.454 --> 33:00.891
Gil? He's not here.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.632
He's not here.

33:02.676 --> 33:04.678
BRIGHT:
Watkins, no!

33:06.288 --> 33:09.204
[rumbling in distance]

33:09.248 --> 33:11.163
It's not a river.

33:13.339 --> 33:14.993
It's the subway.

33:17.082 --> 33:19.040
-We're under...
-There's no place like home.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.045
No!

33:24.089 --> 33:26.526
This photo is from
John Watkins' house.

33:26.569 --> 33:29.050
The angels-- they're...

33:29.094 --> 33:30.443
they're just like mine.

33:32.749 --> 33:34.534
John Watkins was Mr. Boots.

33:34.577 --> 33:37.145
And you didn't tell me
there was a strange man

33:37.189 --> 33:38.581
-in our house?
-No!

33:38.625 --> 33:42.063
No, because I-I-I thought...
I...

33:42.107 --> 33:43.978
I thought he was a ghost.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.763
Because when I followed him down
here to Dad's hobby room,

33:46.807 --> 33:48.591
and-and I turned the corner,
he had...

33:48.635 --> 33:50.550
he disappeared.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.732
Hey, don't be a stranger, okay?

33:58.775 --> 34:00.516
GIL:
Mr. David, wait.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.649
The cabin was a dead end.

34:02.692 --> 34:06.566
-They didn't find him?
-No. If there's anything
else you re...

34:06.609 --> 34:09.177
Martin? Hey.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.049
Hey, Martin?
I need you to focus.

34:13.138 --> 34:14.617
Where would he be?

34:17.098 --> 34:20.232
I know where Watkins
took my boy.

34:20.275 --> 34:22.060
-Where?
-Oh, no.

34:24.149 --> 34:26.412
He's gonna kill them all.

34:38.119 --> 34:40.078
What was that?

34:43.429 --> 34:44.604
[Jessica gasps]

34:49.261 --> 34:51.089
[whispers]:
Run.

34:54.004 --> 34:55.441
Oh, my God,
The Junkyard Killer's here.

34:55.484 --> 34:56.485
You want an interview?

34:57.486 --> 34:58.792
[gasps]

35:02.274 --> 35:03.623
AINSLEY:
Let's go.

35:08.018 --> 35:09.977
[screams]

35:11.457 --> 35:12.893
[groans]

35:15.417 --> 35:16.418
[grunts]

35:16.462 --> 35:17.593
Hey!

35:17.637 --> 35:19.421
No. I'm so sorry.
Come on.

35:19.465 --> 35:20.814
-We got to go. We got to go.
-[groans]

35:20.857 --> 35:22.642
We got to go. Come on.
Come on.

35:34.306 --> 35:36.830
GABRIELLE:
Just take a breath.

35:36.873 --> 35:38.788
Order your thoughts.

35:38.832 --> 35:40.964
You know what
I don't need right now?

35:41.008 --> 35:43.010
Psychotherapy.

35:45.055 --> 35:46.753
My family

35:46.796 --> 35:48.798
is about to be murdered.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.106
What I need...

35:52.150 --> 35:53.934
MARTIN:
What you need...

35:53.977 --> 35:55.588
is your father.

35:55.631 --> 35:58.156
And it's ourfamily.

35:58.199 --> 35:59.461
Our family

35:59.505 --> 36:01.507
is about to be slaughtered.

36:02.638 --> 36:04.988
And just look at you.

36:05.032 --> 36:06.338
Helpless.

36:13.345 --> 36:14.694
[grunts]

36:17.523 --> 36:19.177
This is your fault.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.744
You brought John Watkins
into our lives.

36:23.224 --> 36:25.792
Into our home.

36:25.835 --> 36:28.098
That's where we are.
Right?

36:29.448 --> 36:30.797
Under the house.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.277
Not much gets past you.

36:34.366 --> 36:37.020
A house as old as this
