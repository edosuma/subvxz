02:33.500 --> 02:38.665
I believe there is a place
where the restless souls wander.

02:38.739 --> 02:42.607
Burdened by the weight
of their own sadness,

02:42.676 --> 02:45.372
they wait for a chance
to set the wrong things right.

02:47.447 --> 02:51.042
Only then can they be reunited
with the ones they love.

02:51.118 --> 02:55.748
Sometimes a crow
shows them the way.

02:57.157 --> 03:01.059
- Because sometimes...

03:01.128 --> 03:03.961
- Iove is stronger than death.

03:22.716 --> 03:26.152
- It's not your fault.

03:26.219 --> 03:29.985
- No, no, no.
- We didn't see.

03:32.326 --> 03:35.784
Let him go!
He's just a kid!

03:35.862 --> 03:38.126
He can't hurt you!

03:38.198 --> 03:41.725
I'm scared, Dad.
Please, Dad, I'm sorry.

03:42.903 --> 03:44.700
- No!

04:00.153 --> 04:02.917
Gabriel...

04:02.990 --> 04:04.924
it's been a long night.

04:06.193 --> 04:12.598
Caressing the marble
and stone

04:14.668 --> 04:19.536
Caressing the marble
and stone

04:22.576 --> 04:27.445
Ah, love that was
special for one

04:31.084 --> 04:36.522
The waste in the fever I feel

04:38.925 --> 04:43.294
How I wish you were
here with me now

04:49.503 --> 04:52.995
They call this
"The City of Angels,"

04:53.073 --> 04:56.839
but all I see around me
are victims.

04:56.910 --> 04:59.743
It's the city of drugs...

04:59.813 --> 05:02.577
and of darkness.

05:02.649 --> 05:05.482
The city ofJudah Earl.

05:08.055 --> 05:10.455
Got a name?

05:13.360 --> 05:16.090
Grace. So what?

05:19.800 --> 05:22.496
My name is Sarah.

05:31.711 --> 05:36.478
Listen, Grace, maybe you want
to get some hot coffee...

05:36.550 --> 05:40.646
and a little bit of food.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.654
What do you want?

05:45.559 --> 05:48.357
Nothing.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.659
Do you want to eat here?

06:21.061 --> 06:24.326
We all have our pleasures.

06:24.397 --> 06:27.264
For some, it's the flesh.

06:27.334 --> 06:30.497
And we provide for them.

06:30.570 --> 06:33.334
For others, it's the drugs.

06:33.406 --> 06:37.069
- And we provide for them too.

06:37.144 --> 06:40.409
Our products feed this entire city.

06:42.249 --> 06:45.377
While other kingdoms fall around us,

06:45.452 --> 06:49.252
we've succeeded...

06:49.322 --> 06:52.780
by being of a single mind.

06:52.859 --> 06:57.558
Succeeded with guidance
from a darker world, Judah.

07:01.535 --> 07:03.560
Do you love me, Sibyl?

07:03.637 --> 07:07.437
All must love you.

07:07.507 --> 07:09.441
Really?

07:09.509 --> 07:14.469
Then why did this sad-eyed
sack of shit betray me?

07:14.548 --> 07:16.914
Hey, well, l...

07:16.983 --> 07:20.612
Hey, l-l-l-I didn't
betray you, Judah.

07:20.687 --> 07:23.155
L-l-I did it for
the business, you know?

07:23.223 --> 07:25.851
I mean, this last...
Batch of yours,

07:25.926 --> 07:29.760
it was bad...
it was a hot mix.

07:29.829 --> 07:32.559
I mean, Jesus Christ, Judah,

07:32.632 --> 07:36.329
it was given 'em seizures...
whoa, get away.

07:36.403 --> 07:38.894
Hey, Judah, your...

07:38.972 --> 07:41.634
your brand...

07:41.708 --> 07:44.268
It should inspire trust, right?

07:44.344 --> 07:47.939
I mean, come on, we can't kill off
all the motherfuckers, huh?

07:48.014 --> 07:51.245
I mean, hey, whoa, there'd be
no one left to buy the shit.

07:51.318 --> 07:55.118
So you destroyed 80 keys
of product without my consent.

07:55.188 --> 07:57.122
Hey, hey, back off!

07:57.190 --> 07:59.658
Get the fuck away from me!

07:59.726 --> 08:02.752
Look at this, Judah. You're surrounded
by these fuckin' freaks, man!

08:02.829 --> 08:06.196
You don't even leave
this fun house anymore, man!

08:06.266 --> 08:09.133
I mean, you have no idea what
the shit is doing to people...

08:09.202 --> 08:11.136
out on the streets, man.

08:11.204 --> 08:13.570
It could ruin your fix with the cops.
I'm not bullshittin'.

08:13.640 --> 08:17.041
I mean, it's bad
for business, huh?

08:19.246 --> 08:22.181
All right, then.

08:22.249 --> 08:25.184
Let's see how bad
this batch of ours really is.

08:26.353 --> 08:28.344
Hey! Whoa! Hey!

08:28.421 --> 08:30.548
What the fuck
is goin' on?

08:30.624 --> 08:33.320
We're volunteering you
for a little quality control.

08:33.393 --> 08:37.328
Oh, jeez, Judah.
I'll make it up to you, I swear!

08:37.397 --> 08:41.799
But you are. Weren't you
listening before, Bassett?

08:41.868 --> 08:45.463
I said we all have
our pleasures.

08:45.538 --> 08:47.802
Mine is the pain of others.

08:57.318 --> 08:59.252
Guess you were right, Bassett.

09:01.188 --> 09:04.419
That was a bad batch.

09:04.558 --> 09:06.492
- Whoo!

09:18.172 --> 09:20.106
I'm almost done.

09:20.174 --> 09:23.473
- Are you okay?
- It stings a little.

09:23.544 --> 09:26.513
That's why they call me
the mistress of pain.

09:26.580 --> 09:28.810
I'll get the other book
out for you.

09:28.883 --> 09:31.545
Let's see this masterpiece.
Go ahead, turn around.

09:31.619 --> 09:34.281
Whew. Spin 'round a little.

09:34.355 --> 09:38.018
Ho, ho, ho. There's nothin'
I can do for you, luv.

09:41.329 --> 09:43.490
Christ, what a downer!

09:43.564 --> 09:46.499
Some kid asked me to tattoo,

09:46.567 --> 09:49.536
"If you can read this,
you're standin' too close."

09:49.603 --> 09:51.833
Right on her bum.

09:51.906 --> 09:53.897
I tell ya, I've had it.

09:53.974 --> 09:57.068
Well, it's better than
pushing ink in Detroit.

09:57.144 --> 09:59.305
Well, you can say
that again, darlin'.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.575
You can say that again.

10:01.649 --> 10:03.583
- I got a little present for you.
- You did?

10:03.651 --> 10:07.143
They do them for
the Day of the Dead.

10:07.221 --> 10:09.246
Thank you.

10:09.323 --> 10:12.258
"Necrophagia,"darlin'...
eat the dead.

10:16.464 --> 10:19.524
"Life is just a dream
on the way to death."

10:21.669 --> 10:24.137
I like that.

10:24.205 --> 10:26.639
Do you want to come
have a beer, girl?

10:26.707 --> 10:28.641
Um, no, I can't.

10:28.709 --> 10:32.509
I gotta go home. I haven't been
getting that much sleep lately.

10:32.580 --> 10:35.140
And what is
the dirty dog's name?

10:35.216 --> 10:38.151
No, I've just...

10:38.219 --> 10:42.178
I've just been having these
really, really strange dreams.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.634
I know.

11:56.764 --> 11:59.232
Sleep with angels.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.928
Sleep with angels.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.349
- Did l...

12:20.421 --> 12:24.619
No!

14:26.246 --> 14:29.579
Talk to me, Sibyl.
Tell me what you see.

14:32.353 --> 14:35.914
I see death returning
from the vale of tears.

14:37.524 --> 14:39.549
Look at them down there,

14:39.627 --> 14:44.064
swarming through
the streets like insects.

14:44.131 --> 14:47.328
It's the same each year, isn't it?

14:47.401 --> 14:49.835
Lighting their little candles.

14:49.903 --> 14:52.838
Whispering their wasted prayers.

14:52.906 --> 14:54.965
This time is different, Judah.

14:55.042 --> 14:59.536
This time someone is coming for you.

15:00.981 --> 15:03.415
He has your name
on his tongue.

15:05.419 --> 15:08.411
It's finally
beginning, isn't it?

15:08.489 --> 15:10.582
What mask will death wear?

15:10.658 --> 15:12.592
Can you tell me that?

15:14.328 --> 15:18.822
I see the face
of one of your victims.

15:23.270 --> 15:26.103
All my sins remembered.

15:28.842 --> 15:33.074
Now we're gonna be
face to face

15:36.550 --> 15:40.509
And I lay right down
in my favorite place

15:44.358 --> 15:48.089
Now I wanna be your dog

15:48.162 --> 15:51.962
Now I wanna be your dog

15:52.032 --> 15:55.593
Now I wanna be your dog

16:02.776 --> 16:04.710
Ah, come on

16:08.248 --> 16:11.649
Spider Monkey!

16:11.719 --> 16:15.917
- What's this tattoo look like to you?
- This is a test?

16:15.989 --> 16:19.857
- Come on, man! Tell me what you see!

16:19.927 --> 16:22.418
- Come on!
- A bird.

16:24.098 --> 16:26.498
Think about this!
Think! Think!

16:26.567 --> 16:31.163
- Don't you see two demons?
- No.

16:31.238 --> 16:34.867
I see a bird.

16:34.942 --> 16:39.675
- Fuck you, you fucking fool!

16:42.883 --> 16:45.750
And what's this
in your ear?

16:46.653 --> 16:48.587
Toro, toro!

16:48.655 --> 16:51.681
- Ole!

16:51.759 --> 16:54.660
Look.

17:23.257 --> 17:26.886
- Who are you?
- Sarah.

17:33.967 --> 17:36.231
I had a dream about you.

17:36.303 --> 17:40.330
I saw them shoot you
and your son.

17:41.275 --> 17:44.540
I saw you drowning.

17:44.611 --> 17:46.841
How did I survive?

17:49.516 --> 17:51.507
You didn't.

17:53.153 --> 17:55.087
- You're dead.
- No!

17:55.155 --> 17:57.385
No!

17:57.457 --> 18:00.221
This isn't real.

18:00.294 --> 18:02.922
None of this is real.

18:02.996 --> 18:05.021
No!

18:15.242 --> 18:17.767
Where will we go

18:20.113 --> 18:23.014
Oh, where will we go

18:25.786 --> 18:28.949
This ghost follows

18:29.022 --> 18:30.956
Ah, yes

19:43.330 --> 19:46.231
- Danny! What are you doing?
- Hmm?

19:46.300 --> 19:50.396
- You think you're a man? Come on.
- Yes.

19:53.106 --> 19:55.666
Defense, defense.
The face, the face.

19:55.742 --> 19:58.404
- Yeah, yeah, good.
- Aah! Help!

19:58.478 --> 20:01.413
Want to do bullfighting?
Huh? Do the bull.

20:01.481 --> 20:04.450
- Come on.
- Okay. Uuh!

20:26.039 --> 20:27.973
Danny.

20:44.825 --> 20:46.759
Hey, Dad.

20:46.827 --> 20:50.319
- Yeah?
- Look, I made this.

20:50.397 --> 20:52.865
- Who are they?
- These people?

20:52.933 --> 20:54.798
- Yeah.
- That's you and me.

20:54.868 --> 20:58.201
That's me? And the thing
on top over there?

20:58.271 --> 21:00.671
That?
That's a blue sun.

21:00.741 --> 21:03.437
- A blue sun?
- Yeah, a blue sun.

21:06.246 --> 21:09.272
What was that?

21:09.349 --> 21:11.544
Danny, stay here!

21:15.789 --> 21:17.723
Danny!

21:23.064 --> 21:25.294
Come here.
Come here.

21:28.603 --> 21:30.833
Danny!

21:34.709 --> 21:37.234
See no evil.

21:37.311 --> 21:41.441
- No! No!
- You can run.

21:41.516 --> 21:43.006
Run! Run! Uuh!

21:45.086 --> 21:47.145
No! No!

21:51.559 --> 21:54.619
No! No!

21:54.695 --> 21:57.163
No! Danny!

22:16.617 --> 22:18.380
No!

22:20.755 --> 22:23.189
Leave him alone!

22:23.257 --> 22:25.919
- Dad!

22:25.993 --> 22:28.553
No-o-o! No!

22:56.324 --> 22:58.849
I want to help you.

23:03.297 --> 23:05.231
Danny.

23:05.299 --> 23:07.665
He's not here anymore.

23:12.240 --> 23:14.231
I know.

23:24.318 --> 23:26.252
What's your name?

23:31.058 --> 23:32.992
Ashe.

23:34.962 --> 23:38.022
There's a reason why you've been
brought back, Ashe.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.527
To find the people
who did this to us.

23:47.308 --> 23:49.538
To make them pay.

24:42.463 --> 24:45.432
These were Danny's paints,
weren't they?

25:45.259 --> 25:48.251
Hey, old man
Got something for you

25:50.798 --> 25:54.063
- Change your mind
Gonna make you take it

25:56.137 --> 25:59.504
- Your mistake
is something you own

26:01.375 --> 26:05.106
And I'm the one
who's gonna take it

26:06.981 --> 26:10.246
Hey, old man
Got something for you

26:10.318 --> 26:12.650
Got something for you
Got something for you

26:12.720 --> 26:15.245
Hey, old man
Got a real good tip

26:15.323 --> 26:18.019
- Got a real good tip

26:18.092 --> 26:21.118
- Something's wrong
and you don't know it

26:21.195 --> 26:23.527
You don't know it
You don't know it

26:25.599 --> 26:27.658
When will you learn

26:29.136 --> 26:33.129
I'm not your boy

26:34.508 --> 26:38.467
You don't look back

26:39.914 --> 26:45.614
Why do I pick up
your slack, man

26:50.958 --> 26:56.260
When will you learn

26:56.330 --> 27:02.132
I'm not your boy

27:02.203 --> 27:05.764
Hey, old man
Got something for you

27:05.840 --> 27:09.071
Gonna...

27:36.203 --> 27:39.900
- Ahh!

27:39.974 --> 27:42.408
- Ooh!

27:42.476 --> 27:45.274
- Olé!

27:57.091 --> 28:00.549
- Whoop!

28:00.628 --> 28:02.562
- Toro!

28:02.630 --> 28:04.655
- Ah-ha-ha-ha!

28:20.214 --> 28:22.444
Who the fuck are you?

28:22.516 --> 28:25.952
- Does the corpse have a familiar face?

28:31.826 --> 28:34.659
- Flowers for the dead, señor?

28:34.728 --> 28:37.788
We killed you, man.
You're dead!

28:37.865 --> 28:41.426
- Sorry to disappoint you.
- Whoo-oo-oo!

28:43.704 --> 28:47.765
Stop wasting your breath, angelito.
There's nobody out there listening.

28:47.842 --> 28:52.279
- Yee-aagh!
- I'm all your nightmares...
rolled into one!

28:53.581 --> 28:55.446
- Wuh-aah!

29:00.321 --> 29:02.255
Aa-aa-aah!

29:08.395 --> 29:11.193
Oh, geez! No way, man!

29:28.249 --> 29:30.444
- Fuck! Oh!

29:30.518 --> 29:33.510
This shit's flammable, man.

29:33.587 --> 29:36.852
- The others. Who are they?

29:38.225 --> 29:40.159
- Huh?
- Nemo,

29:40.227 --> 29:43.060
- Hmm.
- Kali, Curve and Judah.

29:43.130 --> 29:46.099
- I'll start with Nemo...

29:46.166 --> 29:48.566
And then work my way
up the food chain.

29:48.636 --> 29:50.763
- Where is he?
- Nemo?

29:50.838 --> 29:53.033
- Mm-hmm.
- He's an old pervert.

29:53.107 --> 29:57.874
He hangs out at the Peep-O-Rama
on Deacon Street.

29:57.945 --> 29:59.572
Congratulations, Monkey!

29:59.647 --> 30:02.548
You just bought yourself
a fighting chance!

30:04.752 --> 30:06.686
Pick a card, Monkey.

30:06.754 --> 30:08.688
Come on.

30:13.661 --> 30:15.595
Come on.

30:28.542 --> 30:31.909
Lady Luck's... a bitch.

30:31.979 --> 30:34.675
Oh...

30:34.748 --> 30:37.376
Jesus, man. Come on, man.

30:37.451 --> 30:39.385
Come on, come on, come on.

30:41.755 --> 30:44.019
You're wasting your breath,
angelito.

30:45.492 --> 30:49.087
- Nobody's up there listening.

31:01.108 --> 31:04.407
I want to be your
Be your rubber ball

31:04.478 --> 31:06.412
- I want to be the one

31:06.480 --> 31:09.574
You love the most of all

31:09.650 --> 31:11.709
Oh, yeah

31:14.521 --> 31:16.614
- I'm your boogie man, boogie man

31:16.690 --> 31:18.851
Turn me on

31:18.926 --> 31:22.293
I'm your boogie man, boogie man
I'll do what you want

31:22.363 --> 31:25.127
I'm your boogie man
Boogie man

31:25.199 --> 31:27.463
Turn me on
I'm your boogie man

32:53.821 --> 32:55.755
Ohh...

32:59.059 --> 33:04.656
I got bad news. Someone torched
the lab on Manchester.

33:04.732 --> 33:07.223
Spider Monkey's
a fucking crispy critter.

33:07.301 --> 33:10.464
Monkey I could care less about.
What about our merchandise?

33:10.537 --> 33:14.166
- It's a total loss.
- He left a sign, didn't he?

33:14.241 --> 33:16.641
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

33:16.710 --> 33:17.404
Yes, you do.

33:17.478 --> 33:20.936
You've seen it.
You've been marked.

33:21.014 --> 33:24.950
Jesus Christ. Judah, why the fuck
do you listen to her?

33:25.018 --> 33:27.816
Because she speaks the truth.

33:29.223 --> 33:31.157
What's this, Curve?

33:31.225 --> 33:33.523
A beauty mark?

33:35.863 --> 33:40.027
And all the world
will be in love with night.

33:40.100 --> 33:44.161
And pay no worship
to the garish sun.

33:46.774 --> 33:48.708
- Noah?
- Yeah.

33:52.546 --> 33:54.708
Do you believe in fate?

33:58.820 --> 34:02.256
Seems to me it's a question
of... fate believin' in you.

34:07.028 --> 34:09.690
- We're closed for the night!

34:09.764 --> 34:12.197
- Open the fucking door!

34:13.434 --> 34:15.732
I said, we're closed. Aah!

34:15.804 --> 34:17.737
- Fucker!

34:18.973 --> 34:20.940
- Think what you did to me was funny?
- God...

34:21.009 --> 34:22.943
- Some kind of joke? Huh?
- Stop! It hurts me!

34:23.011 --> 34:23.636
Huh? Huh?

34:23.710 --> 34:26.646
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:26.714 --> 34:29.911
I'm talkin' about this fuckin' tattoo
you gave me! Look at this shit!

34:29.984 --> 34:32.384
- It's a crow.
- You're goddamn right it's a crow.

34:32.453 --> 34:34.887
Did I ask you for
a fuckin' bird on my chest? Did I?

34:34.956 --> 34:37.652
I was going from the fucking design
that you gave me!

34:37.725 --> 34:40.284
Stop it! Stop it!

34:40.360 --> 34:42.295
O-Oh!

34:43.565 --> 34:46.431
Well, what's it gonna be, hero?

34:46.501 --> 34:49.094
Ready to kiss your faggot ass
good-bye?

34:51.139 --> 34:53.630
I think you're shittin' yourself,
you're so goddamn ready.

34:53.708 --> 34:56.176
Fuck you!
Uuh!

34:58.646 --> 35:01.547
- You fucking piece of shit!

35:01.616 --> 35:05.108
- Aah!
- Get up.

35:05.186 --> 35:09.520
- Girl to girl sincerity

35:09.591 --> 35:12.458
Remains

35:12.527 --> 35:14.927
Awkwardly unnamed

35:19.734 --> 35:23.101
- You never kissed
- I'll be seein' you...

35:23.171 --> 35:25.332
- These girlfriend
- sugarplum.

35:25.406 --> 35:27.567
- Lips

35:29.143 --> 35:33.705
Simple choice to fall away
Fall away

35:33.781 --> 35:37.308
Away, away, away

35:37.385 --> 35:41.446
Away

35:41.522 --> 35:43.456
Why is the world

35:45.193 --> 35:49.061
- Falling on me
- Are you okay?

35:50.098 --> 35:51.725
Well, fuck me. What are they
going to be snorting next?

35:51.799 --> 35:54.962
- I can't take this anymore.

35:55.036 --> 35:56.970
Don't worry, love.

35:57.038 --> 36:00.007
Everything'll work itself out.

36:31.372 --> 36:34.102
Did she make
you cry, make you break down

36:35.176 --> 36:37.610
- Aah!
- And shatter your illusions of love

36:37.679 --> 36:40.842
- Fuckin' shit, motherfucker!

36:43.151 --> 36:45.085
Smile, sister.

36:48.756 --> 36:51.281
- Whoo! Hey!

36:51.359 --> 36:53.293
This is a recording.

36:53.361 --> 36:55.454
- Tokens for the bunny booths.

36:55.530 --> 36:58.090
- Live girls.

36:58.166 --> 37:01.397
- Tokens for the bunny booths.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.461
- Live girls.
- It's his wreck. It's all right.

37:04.539 --> 37:06.473
What up, Zeke?

37:06.541 --> 37:08.771
Right.
How ya doin', man?

37:08.843 --> 37:11.573
This is for you.
For you.

37:35.570 --> 37:38.539
You got a name?

37:38.606 --> 37:41.166
- Holly Daze.
- Put your hands in the air

37:41.242 --> 37:44.575
Tonight is a special night

37:44.645 --> 37:46.875
- You want me, baby?
- Put your hands in the air

37:46.948 --> 37:50.281
Tonight is a special night
Check this one

37:50.351 --> 37:50.783
Oh...

37:50.852 --> 37:52.945
Throw your hands
in the air tonight

37:53.021 --> 37:54.682
Uh... I wanna see some sugar.

37:54.756 --> 37:57.486
Check me out, Pop
Throw your hands high in the air

37:57.558 --> 37:57.819
Sugar?

37:57.892 --> 38:00.224
- Right on, sister.

38:03.898 --> 38:07.891
Mmm. Is that for me?

38:07.969 --> 38:09.903
Oh, yeah.

38:09.971 --> 38:13.202
Yeah.

38:13.274 --> 38:16.539
We're gonna celebrate Christmas
a little early this year.

38:22.450 --> 38:27.752
Mmm. Keep doin' that, baby,
you're gonna go blind.

38:27.822 --> 38:31.019
- Fuck! Fuck!

38:40.401 --> 38:42.335
Oh, yes!

38:44.605 --> 38:47.802
Time's almost up, lover.

38:47.875 --> 38:49.638
Hurry with those tokens.

38:49.710 --> 38:51.871
- Oh, shit, man!

38:58.686 --> 39:01.052
Come on!

39:01.122 --> 39:03.056
Bitch!

39:04.492 --> 39:06.551
Come on, fucker!
Come on, fucker!

39:15.870 --> 39:18.304
Do you want me...

39:19.807 --> 39:21.900
baby?

39:23.277 --> 39:25.142
You...

39:25.213 --> 39:27.147
Me.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.546
- Hey! Fuckin'mime boy!

39:38.226 --> 39:40.490
- Uuh!

39:42.997 --> 39:45.124
One crow, sorrow.

39:45.199 --> 39:47.133
Two crows...

39:47.201 --> 39:49.465
joy!

39:51.038 --> 39:53.438
- Three crows...
- Oh, ah!

39:53.508 --> 39:56.136
A letter!

39:58.579 --> 40:00.513
- Four crows...
- Uuh!

40:00.581 --> 40:04.142
- Uuh! Aah!
- A boy.

40:04.218 --> 40:07.153
- Let him go! He's just a child.

40:08.756 --> 40:11.691
Uuh! Uh! Aah!

40:13.194 --> 40:15.856
- Five crows, silver!
- Aah!

40:15.930 --> 40:18.125
- Six crows, gold!

40:18.199 --> 40:22.499
Seven crows,
a secret never to be told!

40:22.570 --> 40:25.630
Aah! Stop the fuck...
Aah! Please!

40:25.706 --> 40:27.640
No, please!

40:27.708 --> 40:32.839
- Please, just stop! I can't...
- Look at me!

40:32.914 --> 40:36.145
Lights! Camera! Action!

40:36.217 --> 40:39.277
- Aah!
- You killed my son, Nemo.

40:39.353 --> 40:41.981
You took away the only
piece of light left in my soul.

40:42.056 --> 40:45.787
We had to! We had to!
It wasn't our fault!

40:45.860 --> 40:49.921
Was Judah's orders.
Never leave any witnesses.

40:49.997 --> 40:53.091
We didn't have any choice.

40:53.167 --> 40:55.658
We always have a choice!

41:00.741 --> 41:03.608
- Tokens for the bunny booths.
- Go, let's go!

41:03.678 --> 41:06.909
- Live girls.
- Ow! Yeah!

41:06.981 --> 41:09.711
- Tokens for the bunny booths.
- Let's go!

41:09.784 --> 41:12.514
- Live girls.

41:12.587 --> 41:15.317
- Tokens for the bunny booths.

41:15.389 --> 41:17.823
Live girls.

41:18.960 --> 41:21.326
Tokens for the bunny booths.

41:21.395 --> 41:25.263
Live girls.

41:25.333 --> 41:27.392
Tokens for the bunny booths.
Live...

41:27.468 --> 41:28.867
In my room I want you here

41:32.573 --> 41:36.270
Now we're gonna be
face to face

41:39.847 --> 41:44.147
And I lay right down in my
favorite place

41:44.218 --> 41:45.116
Holy fuck.

42:16.317 --> 42:20.276
Do you know what they call
a gathering of crows... Curve?

42:20.354 --> 42:23.152
- A murder.

42:23.224 --> 42:26.853
A murder of crows.

42:26.927 --> 42:29.725
Think about it.

43:22.049 --> 43:24.609
Can I help you?

43:27.822 --> 43:29.756
I'm sorry, Father.

43:33.828 --> 43:36.262
I was just watching.

43:36.330 --> 43:38.264
Our doors were open.

43:39.600 --> 43:41.534
What's all this for?

43:41.602 --> 43:44.571
Dia de los Muertos.
Day of the Dead.

43:45.740 --> 43:47.571
We light candles
for our loved ones...

43:47.641 --> 43:49.768
so they might find their way
back to Earth.

43:49.844 --> 43:52.039
Tomorrow night
we will celebrate.

43:52.113 --> 43:56.243
The people will dance and sing
and some will wear masks.

43:59.820 --> 44:01.754
Why?

44:02.757 --> 44:06.193
Some spirits
linger here too long.

44:06.260 --> 44:09.093
They become confused,

44:09.163 --> 44:11.393
mistaking themselves
for the living.

44:13.234 --> 44:15.566
They must be
frightened away.

44:16.637 --> 44:20.505
Santa Muerte.
Santa Muerte.

44:20.574 --> 44:23.304
No soporte.
No lo soporte.

44:24.512 --> 44:27.845
Santa Muerte.
No soporte.

45:07.721 --> 45:09.655
Maybe there is another way.

45:18.432 --> 45:21.265
- How... How'd you do that?
- Magic.

45:23.804 --> 45:26.773
Blow on it.
Go on.

45:26.841 --> 45:28.775
Like birthday candles.

45:37.885 --> 45:40.115
You have power
just like I do.

45:42.022 --> 45:43.956
You have power over this.

46:04.445 --> 46:06.379
That's him!

46:06.447 --> 46:09.382
That's the son of a bitch I dumped
off the pier, I know it.

46:09.450 --> 46:11.680
I saw you kill him.

46:11.752 --> 46:15.381
Look, you wanna tell yourself
some bullshit fairy tales,
that's your business.

46:15.456 --> 46:19.119
- I'm not gonna sit here with
a fuckin'target on my chest.

46:19.193 --> 46:21.286
I'm gonna take
this motherfucker out.

46:21.362 --> 46:26.198
You won't stop him
with guns or knives.

46:27.702 --> 46:30.603
He doesn't feel pain.

46:42.183 --> 46:45.016
His soul has crossed over.

46:45.086 --> 46:48.681
So how do you stop a man
who's already dead?

46:48.757 --> 46:52.488
Can you look Destiny
in the eye...

46:52.561 --> 46:54.722
without flinching?

46:56.798 --> 46:58.732
You tell me.

47:06.007 --> 47:10.239
The crow
is his source of power;

47:10.312 --> 47:14.271
his link between this world
and the next.

47:14.349 --> 47:19.480
Sever that link, and he's
as vulnerable as the next man.

47:43.111 --> 47:45.045
You came back.

47:57.158 --> 47:59.524
Were you married?

48:00.729 --> 48:04.221
My ring...
It belonged to some friends.

48:07.469 --> 48:09.733
Where are they now?

48:10.805 --> 48:12.739
A better place.

48:14.643 --> 48:16.577
What about you?

48:17.746 --> 48:21.375
Danny's mother left
after he was born.

48:22.717 --> 48:24.651
She was a drug addict.

48:27.689 --> 48:31.648
You knocked me out

48:31.726 --> 48:34.957
Bit my lip

48:35.030 --> 48:37.464
- You held me down
- What happens to me...

48:37.532 --> 48:40.365
- And kept me sober
- when I finish what
I'm supposed to do here?

48:43.304 --> 48:45.602
Through all this time

48:45.674 --> 48:48.837
- You go back.

48:48.910 --> 48:51.470
With no regret

48:51.546 --> 48:55.949
Guess that's just the way
I liked it

48:57.686 --> 49:00.246
- Ooo
- And what if I don't want to go back?

49:00.321 --> 49:03.950
- Oh whoa-oa

49:15.470 --> 49:18.906
That tattoo on your chest...
Who gave it to you?

49:18.973 --> 49:22.409
Some bitch down at the Gargoyle.
What's that got to do with anything?

49:22.477 --> 49:26.072
Everything, you idiot!
Find her.

49:26.147 --> 49:29.605
If she gave you his mark,
she's connected to him in some way.

49:29.684 --> 49:32.346
She can lead us to him.
Fool!

49:44.466 --> 49:48.232
Mm-aah!
What do you people want?

49:51.239 --> 49:53.173
A house in the country.

49:56.911 --> 49:58.845
A little dog.

50:00.181 --> 50:02.115
A wife.

50:03.017 --> 50:05.008
Two kids...

50:05.086 --> 50:08.852
- and your fucking head
stapled to my pussy seat.

50:10.258 --> 50:13.659
- Listen...

50:13.728 --> 50:15.958
We're only looking for Sarah.

50:16.030 --> 50:18.225
Where is she, Noah?

50:18.299 --> 50:20.597
I ain't gonna tell you that.

50:25.707 --> 50:29.199
- I wish I could lose control

50:32.213 --> 50:35.580
- But I think you are.
- I wish I could let go

50:37.986 --> 50:39.920
I'm cumming on you

50:39.988 --> 50:41.956
I'm cumming, I'm cumming
I'm cumming on you

50:42.023 --> 50:42.717
Last chance, love.

50:42.791 --> 50:46.727
- Go fuck yourself, you dried-up bitch!

50:46.795 --> 50:49.923
I'm cumming, I'm cumming
I'm cumming on you

50:49.998 --> 50:52.762
I'm cumming, I'm cumming
I'm cumming on you

51:28.870 --> 51:31.930
I took Danny last summer.

51:32.006 --> 51:35.237
We went up on the bike.

51:35.310 --> 51:37.335
Rode all the way up the coast.

51:40.048 --> 51:43.074
It was cold, I remember.

51:43.151 --> 51:44.618
We could see our breath.

51:52.660 --> 51:54.594
Look at me.

52:03.304 --> 52:05.238
Ashe?

52:07.141 --> 52:09.075
L-Look at me.

52:09.143 --> 52:13.307
No. No.

52:14.649 --> 52:16.583
We can't do this.

52:19.621 --> 52:22.055
I have to find the others.

52:25.059 --> 52:27.493
I have to finish what I started.

53:33.594 --> 53:35.528
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

53:35.596 --> 53:37.996
- Look.
- Who are they?

53:38.066 --> 53:40.500
- These people down here?
- Yeah.

53:40.568 --> 53:42.502
That's you and me.

53:43.972 --> 53:45.906
Sleep with angels.

53:49.711 --> 53:52.805
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to look.
- It's not your fault.

53:52.880 --> 53:55.144
- Lights!
- Look at me! It's not your fault.
You understand?

53:55.216 --> 53:58.617
Action! Action!
Flowers for the dead, señor?

53:58.686 --> 54:00.711
- No!

54:00.788 --> 54:03.313
Stop wasting your breath, angelito.

54:03.391 --> 54:07.657
Let him get out! Let him alone!
He's just a kid!

54:07.729 --> 54:10.892
- What about the kid?

54:10.965 --> 54:15.061
Pain is my power.
Kill them both.

54:15.136 --> 54:17.104
Let him alone!

54:17.171 --> 54:20.072
Let him alone!
He's just a kid!

54:20.141 --> 54:22.666
- He doesn't even know who you are.

54:22.744 --> 54:26.703
- Don't, please, don't.
- Hush, little baby
Please don't cry

54:26.781 --> 54:29.181
I beg you!
I beg you, please!

54:29.250 --> 54:33.778
- Kali's gonna give you
eternal life
- Don't! No! Aah!

54:33.855 --> 54:37.291
- No! Aah!

54:37.358 --> 54:39.792
- Nothing personal, sport.

54:41.462 --> 54:46.729
I guess you were just in the wrong
place... at the wrong time. Heh!

54:56.711 --> 54:58.702
Dump 'em!

56:44.485 --> 56:46.419
Ah! Hah!

57:20.588 --> 57:23.079
Sarah's gone.

57:24.158 --> 57:26.456
Ghost man.

57:26.527 --> 57:28.859
Where is she?

57:32.433 --> 57:35.596
You took my son's life.

57:35.670 --> 57:39.436
Some people are
just born victims.

57:40.942 --> 57:43.467
Hush, little baby
Please don't cry

57:45.546 --> 57:48.071
Do you know how to fight?

57:48.149 --> 57:50.709
Do you know how to die?

57:53.287 --> 57:56.154
- Yah!

58:05.066 --> 58:07.000
- Come on.

58:09.237 --> 58:11.171
Hah!

58:21.482 --> 58:24.508
- Hi! Hah!

58:39.367 --> 58:42.700
- Do you want to dance?

58:44.438 --> 58:47.930
- Kali's gonna give you eternal...

59:02.924 --> 59:04.892
Hah! Ah!

59:06.194 --> 59:08.526
- Ah!

59:26.081 --> 59:29.244
Hush, little baby...

59:29.318 --> 59:31.252
Shh.

59:34.389 --> 59:36.323
Don't say a word.

59:48.103 --> 59:50.435
N... No!

59:50.505 --> 59:53.338
Daddy's gonna buy you
a big, black bird!

01:00:18.734 --> 01:00:21.669
When I first heard the sound

01:00:23.805 --> 01:00:26.569
I couldn't put it down

01:00:28.877 --> 01:00:31.744
It made my life complete

01:00:31.813 --> 01:00:33.747
Ah, give it to me.
Yeah.

01:00:35.217 --> 01:00:37.617
Ain't it neat

01:00:40.856 --> 01:00:43.188
And you know
I like it when you

01:00:43.258 --> 01:00:46.159
- Spit

01:00:48.864 --> 01:00:51.697
Oh, I like it when you

01:00:54.703 --> 01:00:56.637
Spit

01:00:56.705 --> 01:00:58.639
- Naughty boy!

01:00:58.707 --> 01:01:01.437
- And when you do that

01:01:03.311 --> 01:01:06.144
You know I'm getting wet

01:01:07.783 --> 01:01:10.718
- Wear me on your head

01:01:10.786 --> 01:01:14.017
Yeah, that's what I said

01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:18.685
I wanna be
your rock and roll

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:23.163
I wanna be
your rock and roll

01:01:23.231 --> 01:01:28.897
You know I wanna be your
push and pull and it's only 'cause

01:01:32.107 --> 01:01:35.440
I like it, whoo

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:39.469
Girl, I like it

01:01:39.548 --> 01:01:42.881
Whoo, girl I like it

01:01:42.951 --> 01:01:45.647
- Oh, yeah

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:48.484
Waaahh!

01:01:54.996 --> 01:01:57.464
Nothing personal,

01:01:57.532 --> 01:01:59.966
sport.

01:02:00.035 --> 01:02:02.629
- Hey!

01:02:04.639 --> 01:02:06.630
- Look out!

01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:16.915
Ow!

01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:51.976
Fuck you, bird dick!

01:02:53.188 --> 01:02:55.713
Time's up, Curve!

01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:57.724
My naked cousin

01:02:57.792 --> 01:02:59.885
I see him running

01:02:59.961 --> 01:03:01.895
All over his land

01:03:01.963 --> 01:03:06.957
- Scared as a chick-a-chicken

01:03:07.035 --> 01:03:10.232
His naked skin fries

01:03:10.305 --> 01:03:12.967
Fries in the sun

01:03:13.041 --> 01:03:15.032
But my, my naked cousin

01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:18.238
Can cook 'til
he's good, good and done

01:03:18.313 --> 01:03:20.247
He's running

01:03:24.085 --> 01:03:26.246
He's running

01:03:53.582 --> 01:03:56.915
He's running

01:03:58.687 --> 01:04:01.349
Baby, he's running

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.355
He's running

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.534
He's running

01:04:17.639 --> 01:04:19.573
He's running

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.254
Yeah!

01:05:23.371 --> 01:05:25.805
Wrong place.
Wrong time.

01:05:28.343 --> 01:05:30.277
Eh, Curve?

01:05:36.551 --> 01:05:38.849
Do you think
I'm afraid of you?

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.357
You fucking freak!
Do you think I'm afraid?

01:05:43.425 --> 01:05:46.792
- You think I'm afraid!

01:06:23.398 --> 01:06:25.696
Can you hear me, Curve?

01:06:29.771 --> 01:06:32.205
You're going to die now.

01:06:38.446 --> 01:06:41.882
People used to put coins
in the mouths of the dead.

01:06:42.951 --> 01:06:44.885
Do you know why?

01:06:47.856 --> 01:06:51.952
So they could pay the ferryman
to take them across the river Styx.

01:06:59.033 --> 01:07:00.967
What's this?

01:07:12.147 --> 01:07:14.547
Open your mouth, Curve.

01:07:55.356 --> 01:07:58.450
I want to thank you
for showing me my pain, Curve.

01:07:59.527 --> 01:08:01.586
You made me what I am.

01:08:07.902 --> 01:08:09.836
Flores.

01:08:09.904 --> 01:08:12.998
Flores para los muertos.

01:08:13.074 --> 01:08:15.008
Flores.

01:08:18.613 --> 01:08:21.104
Flores.

01:08:21.182 --> 01:08:24.151
Flores para los muertos.

01:08:24.219 --> 01:08:26.153
Flores.

01:08:51.312 --> 01:08:53.246
Where am I?

01:08:56.618 --> 01:08:58.950
The tower.

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:02.285
Everyone finds
their way here eventually.

01:09:08.296 --> 01:09:11.459
What happened to you?

01:09:11.532 --> 01:09:14.558
Fate happened to her.

01:09:14.636 --> 01:09:17.662
Sibyl's been cursed
with the gift of prophecy.

01:09:17.738 --> 01:09:19.798
Judah Earl.

01:09:19.874 --> 01:09:21.933
She sees things
that are fated to happen.

01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:24.638
She cut out her eyes
with a carving knife...

01:09:24.712 --> 01:09:27.647
because she wanted to make
the visions stop.

01:09:27.715 --> 01:09:30.444
But that only made the visions
stronger, didn't it, dear?

01:09:30.518 --> 01:09:33.578
Why did you bring me here?

01:09:33.654 --> 01:09:35.747
I'm glad you asked that, Sarah.

01:09:35.823 --> 01:09:39.987
You've got a very important part
to play in this little drama of ours.

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:42.791
I intend to capture the crow,

01:09:44.299 --> 01:09:46.233
and you, my dear,

01:09:47.568 --> 01:09:49.627
are the birdseed.

01:10:11.693 --> 01:10:13.627
Sarah.

01:10:38.286 --> 01:10:40.345
First you smiled at no one

01:10:40.421 --> 01:10:42.889
I found you first

01:10:42.957 --> 01:10:45.187
They've grown fine
inside of you

01:10:47.362 --> 01:10:52.322
But it hurts if I even see you
Make you smile

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.834
I look over and cry

01:10:56.904 --> 01:10:59.737
But that's too bad
Get stuck for nothing at all

01:10:59.807 --> 01:11:02.537
Look at yourself
You ain't no genius

01:11:02.610 --> 01:11:04.544
You won't to find
You won't find me

01:11:10.985 --> 01:11:13.078
Go!

01:11:15.156 --> 01:11:17.215
Go!

01:11:23.698 --> 01:11:26.292
Look who's come home to roost.

01:11:33.275 --> 01:11:35.436
Aah!

01:11:37.446 --> 01:11:40.210
But that's too bad

01:11:40.282 --> 01:11:42.307
- You'll get what you pay for

01:11:42.384 --> 01:11:44.978
Look at yourself
You ain't no genius

01:11:45.054 --> 01:11:47.181
You want to find
You won't find me

01:11:47.256 --> 01:11:48.951
I'm coming home when I go

01:11:55.631 --> 01:11:58.361
Aah

01:12:07.576 --> 01:12:10.101
Ashe is here.

01:12:14.716 --> 01:12:17.378
First you fight me

01:12:17.453 --> 01:12:20.149
I found you first

01:12:20.222 --> 01:12:23.419
They've grown fine
inside of you

01:12:32.801 --> 01:12:36.430
- Do you know
what these are called?

01:12:36.505 --> 01:12:38.598
Misericords.

01:12:38.674 --> 01:12:40.869
Wonderful name,
isn't it?

01:12:42.611 --> 01:12:47.674
In the Dark Ages, these were
used to deliver the death stroke...

01:12:47.749 --> 01:12:49.842
to the mortally wounded.

01:12:49.918 --> 01:12:53.012
They were considered
tools of mercy.

01:13:24.119 --> 01:13:26.212
Easy.

01:13:26.288 --> 01:13:29.018
Easy.

01:13:46.942 --> 01:13:49.604
- Ah!

01:14:10.599 --> 01:14:13.033
- Oww!

01:14:23.512 --> 01:14:26.310
- Aah!

01:14:33.322 --> 01:14:35.916
Ashes, ashes,

01:14:35.991 --> 01:14:39.552
- Oh!
- We all fall down.

01:14:42.397 --> 01:14:44.262
No!

01:15:52.434 --> 01:15:55.301
You have taken his power.

01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:57.304
He is only a man now.

01:16:04.246 --> 01:16:06.180
Ah.

01:16:14.589 --> 01:16:16.955
Hey, Dad!

01:16:29.905 --> 01:16:32.840
If you give up now,
we won't be together.

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:40.873
Danny!

01:16:54.062 --> 01:16:56.223
Judah!

01:17:04.306 --> 01:17:06.240
What...
What are you?

01:17:06.308 --> 01:17:09.175
I'm your shadow, Ashe.

01:17:09.244 --> 01:17:11.644
Every angel's got a devil.

01:17:11.713 --> 01:17:14.443
I've tasted the blood
of the crow and taken your power!

01:17:19.187 --> 01:17:24.489
The crows. They are the souls
who have come before Ashe.

01:17:24.559 --> 01:17:27.756
They are crying
for the people they have lost.

01:17:27.829 --> 01:17:30.559
Now they have come for him.

01:17:31.833 --> 01:17:34.768
Looks like the dead have
forsaken you, my friend.

01:17:34.836 --> 01:17:36.929
- Look at you!
- Go to hell!

01:17:37.005 --> 01:17:38.870
Already been there!

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:41.704
And I must confess,
I liked what I saw!

01:17:50.419 --> 01:17:52.785
Where's your strength, huh?
Where's your power?

01:17:54.389 --> 01:17:56.653
You're nothing now, Ashe.

01:17:56.725 --> 01:17:58.716
Not even a ghost.

01:18:22.617 --> 01:18:25.245
- You want death?
- Yeah!

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.948
There he is, people!
Take a good look!

01:18:48.043 --> 01:18:51.501
Uh! If you whip him,
does he not bleed?

01:19:07.929 --> 01:19:11.330
- Ashe!

01:19:13.702 --> 01:19:17.365
Aah!

01:19:28.917 --> 01:19:31.545
Sarah.

01:19:35.123 --> 01:19:37.182
Sarah! Sarah!

01:19:37.259 --> 01:19:39.250
Judah!

01:20:08.957 --> 01:20:11.357
Aah!

01:20:11.426 --> 01:20:13.587
Oh!

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:28.102
You can't stop me
anymore, Ashe.

01:20:29.778 --> 01:20:31.939
You haven't got the power.

01:20:32.013 --> 01:20:35.141
There's nothing
but pain for you now.

01:20:36.384 --> 01:20:39.251
Pain is my power.

01:20:49.564 --> 01:20:53.261
Take him!

01:20:56.838 --> 01:20:58.806
Aah!

01:21:41.016 --> 01:21:43.849
You can't die.

01:21:52.961 --> 01:21:54.895
Oh, God.

01:23:00.161 --> 01:23:02.026
Wait!

01:23:08.636 --> 01:23:11.070
I wanted to thank you.

01:23:14.642 --> 01:23:17.702
Where are you going now?

01:23:21.449 --> 01:23:23.383
A better place.

01:23:56.551 --> 01:24:01.181
I believe there's a place
where the restless souls wander...

01:24:01.256 --> 01:24:04.021
burdened by the weight
of their own sadness.

01:24:04.093 --> 01:24:07.688
They wait for a chance
to set the wrong things right.

01:24:07.763 --> 01:24:11.460
Only then can they be reunited
with the ones they love.

01:24:11.534 --> 01:24:16.028
Sometimes a crow
shows them the way...

01:24:16.105 --> 01:24:20.405
because sometimes
love is stronger than death.

01:24:47.636 --> 01:24:50.833
Rock on, gold dust woman

01:24:50.906 --> 01:24:53.466
Take your silver spoon

01:24:53.542 --> 01:24:56.477
Dig your grave

01:25:02.251 --> 01:25:08.315
One less challenge
Pick your path and I'll pray

01:25:15.464 --> 01:25:18.524
Wake up in the morning

01:25:18.601 --> 01:25:22.901
See your sunlight
burning to go down

01:25:29.845 --> 01:25:36.717
Lousy lovers pick their graves
but they never cry out loud

01:25:38.621 --> 01:25:41.249
Cry out

01:25:42.658 --> 01:25:46.116
Well, did she make you cry
Make you break down

01:25:46.195 --> 01:25:49.358
Shatter your illusions
of love

01:25:49.431 --> 01:25:53.026
Is it over now
Do you know how

01:25:53.102 --> 01:25:56.162
To pick up the pieces
and go home

01:25:56.238 --> 01:25:59.674
Did she make you cry
Make you break down

01:25:59.742 --> 01:26:02.711
Shatter your illusions
of love

01:26:02.778 --> 01:26:06.475
And did you know by now
Do you know how

01:26:06.548 --> 01:26:09.642
To pick up the pieces
and go home

01:26:18.127 --> 01:26:20.357
To go home

01:26:20.429 --> 01:26:23.990
Home, home, home

01:26:24.066 --> 01:26:27.331
Oh, shadow of a woman

01:26:32.708 --> 01:26:36.610
Oh, oh, shadow of a woman

01:26:36.679 --> 01:26:40.809
Ooo, yeah

01:26:42.851 --> 01:26:47.914
Ooo, ooo
shadow of a woman

01:26:49.658 --> 01:26:55.028
Ooo, yeah
shadow of a woman

01:26:55.097 --> 01:27:00.364
Come on, come on
Black widow

01:27:03.005 --> 01:27:06.873
Ooo, ooo, ooo

01:27:09.778 --> 01:27:15.080
Whoo, hey, ah

01:27:15.150 --> 01:27:19.348

01:27:19.421 --> 01:27:21.787
Black widow

01:27:23.359 --> 01:27:29.423
Ooo, yeah
shadow of a woman

01:27:29.498 --> 01:27:34.435
Shadow of a woman
Black widow

01:27:36.672 --> 01:27:42.167
Ooo, yeah
shadow of a woman

01:27:46.482 --> 01:27:48.712
Black widow

01:28:19.615 --> 01:28:22.106
Hey, old man
Got something for you

01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:28.153
Change your mind
Gonna make you take it

01:28:30.459 --> 01:28:33.587
Your mistake is
something you own

01:28:35.798 --> 01:28:39.063
And I'm the one
who's gonna take it

01:28:41.437 --> 01:28:44.372
Hey, old man

01:28:46.708 --> 01:28:49.643
Hey, old man

01:28:52.381 --> 01:28:55.578
Something's wrong
and you don't own it

01:28:57.786 --> 01:29:01.620
When will you learn

01:29:03.258 --> 01:29:06.887
I'm not your boy

01:29:08.530 --> 01:29:12.660
You don't look back

01:29:14.169 --> 01:29:19.197
Why do I pick up your slack

01:29:30.652 --> 01:29:33.587
When else you been in my bed

01:29:35.924 --> 01:29:39.291
Got your picture in my head

01:29:41.597 --> 01:29:44.498
God, you are so truly old

01:29:46.969 --> 01:29:49.767
Thanks a lot
My future is sold

01:29:49.838 --> 01:29:51.772
No

01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:01.609
When will you learn

01:30:03.185 --> 01:30:06.780
I'm not your boy

01:30:08.824 --> 01:30:11.315

01:30:14.163 --> 01:30:18.429
Hey, old man
