09:55.803 --> 09:59.266
I'm not gonna prancing around

09:55.803 --> 09:59.266
like some smiling slab of beef.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.726
Jess, this is the biggest break

09:59.307 --> 10:01.726
of our careers.

10:01.768 --> 10:02.977
Now, don't blow it just because

10:03.019 --> 10:06.273
you have this weird hang-up

10:03.019 --> 10:06.273
about beef.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.234
Katsopolis, let me explain

10:06.314 --> 10:09.234
your options to you.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.653
Either you do it, you do it,

10:09.276 --> 10:12.653
or you do it.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.573
What was the second one again?

10:18.201 --> 10:19.702
Hi, dad.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.702
<i>Hola,</i> Becky.

10:19.744 --> 10:20.828
- Hi, girls.

10:19.744 --> 10:20.828
- Hi.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.497
Well, have a great Career Day.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.499
Send my regards

10:22.539 --> 10:24.499
to Connie Chung.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.835
Boy, Mr. T, you sure

10:24.541 --> 10:27.835
do look snappy in earth tones.

10:30.547 --> 10:33.216
What do you want,

10:30.547 --> 10:33.216
Gibbler?

10:33.258 --> 10:36.761
Dad, remember Jimmy Chung,

10:33.258 --> 10:36.761
the pathological liar?

10:38.012 --> 10:39.973
Oh, I'm just

10:38.012 --> 10:39.973
taking a shot here

10:40.014 --> 10:42.350
but, uh, he couldn't

10:40.014 --> 10:42.350
get his Aunt Connie, huh?

10:42.392 --> 10:45.145
He doesn't have

10:42.392 --> 10:45.145
an Aunt Connie.

10:45.186 --> 10:48.022
His name's

10:45.186 --> 10:48.022
not even Chung.

10:48.064 --> 10:51.234
[chuckling]

10:48.064 --> 10:51.234
Well, what do you know?

10:51.276 --> 10:54.070
Looks like you two are in

10:51.276 --> 10:54.070
the market for a major TV star.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.906
Oh, oh, Kimmy, Kimmy, Kimmy.

10:58.699 --> 11:01.578
Why don't you have your people

10:58.699 --> 11:01.578
call my people, huh?

11:01.620 --> 11:03.704
- I'll do it.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.704
- Thanks, Becky.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.165
- Be there right after lunch.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.165
- Okay.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.627
Whoa, whoa, girls, uh,

11:05.206 --> 11:08.627
can't a guy make a joke?

11:08.668 --> 11:11.045
You know, I don't have

11:08.668 --> 11:11.045
any people, you're my people.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.882
It's okay, dad,

11:12.713 --> 11:14.882
you can do it.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.801
I should've asked you

11:14.924 --> 11:16.801
in the first place.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.304
I just got caught up

11:16.843 --> 11:19.304
in Chung-mania.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.930
Oh, didn't we all?

11:28.313 --> 11:29.981
What is this?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.108
This isn't what we ordered.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.108
We ordered a library set.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.235
Not a bathroom set.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.945
Okay, strike it.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.945
Strike the set.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.696
Who's responsible

11:35.987 --> 11:37.696
for this?

11:37.738 --> 11:40.033
This was Ms. Garland's idea.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.660
Okay, people,

11:40.074 --> 11:41.660
back to work.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.662
Come on, let's move,

11:41.700 --> 11:43.662
let's go.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.872
I just couldn't see

11:43.702 --> 11:45.872
the IQ Man in a library.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.542
In fact, the more,

11:45.913 --> 11:48.542
I thought about it

11:48.583 --> 11:51.919
the more I saw you

11:48.583 --> 11:51.919
in the, uh...shower.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.509
Why would I wear

11:55.048 --> 11:57.509
a smoking jacket in a shower?

11:57.551 --> 11:59.135
Exactly.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.596
That's why

11:59.177 --> 12:01.596
you'll be wearing this.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.273
And action!

12:14.359 --> 12:17.612
I want to know if I can live

12:14.359 --> 12:17.612
with what I know..

12:20.448 --> 12:21.949
...and only that.

12:23.535 --> 12:26.287
Cut, cut,

12:23.535 --> 12:26.287
cut, cut, cut.

12:26.329 --> 12:29.832
Jess, the concept

12:26.329 --> 12:29.832
is the IQ Man

12:29.874 --> 12:31.918
not the IQ head.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.796
Too bad. The head's

12:33.253 --> 12:35.796
all you're getting.

12:35.838 --> 12:39.426
Maybe little ice cold water

12:35.838 --> 12:39.426
will help him over his shyness.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.387
Whoa-a-h! Okay. I'm out.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.387
I'm out. I'm out. I'm out.

12:43.971 --> 12:47.766
No, no.

12:43.971 --> 12:47.766
No need to dry off.

12:47.808 --> 12:53.356
In fact, I would like

12:47.808 --> 12:53.356
to see your body...wetter.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.400
The wetter, the better.

12:56.651 --> 12:59.862
Excuse us, won't you?

12:56.651 --> 12:59.862
Joseph, hop on.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.701
You see, this is exactly

13:03.032 --> 13:04.701
what I'm talking about.

13:04.743 --> 13:07.328
I'm nothing but a big mac

13:04.743 --> 13:07.328
in a bath towel.

13:07.370 --> 13:10.081
Joey, I'm not a hamburger.

13:07.370 --> 13:10.081
I happen to be a human being.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.919
Jess, buddy,

13:11.750 --> 13:14.919
as long as I'm the director

13:14.961 --> 13:17.422
you will be treated

13:14.961 --> 13:17.422
with dignity and respect.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.049
- Thank you.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.049
- Okay. Hose him down.

13:20.091 --> 13:22.469
Ho-ho-hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

13:20.091 --> 13:22.469
Watch the hair. Watch the hair.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.011
Excuse me.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.975
Take two.

13:29.016 --> 13:31.978
Okay, this time,

13:29.016 --> 13:31.978
give me more steam.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.439
'And action!'

13:34.481 --> 13:37.317
I want..

13:34.481 --> 13:37.317
[coughs]

13:37.358 --> 13:39.486
I want to know..

13:39.527 --> 13:40.987
...if I can live

13:41.028 --> 13:43.740
with what I know..

13:43.782 --> 13:45.492
...and only that.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.747
There's something about him

13:47.786 --> 13:50.747
I can't resist.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.248
Is it his eyes?

13:56.628 --> 13:58.713
Is it his smile?

14:00.006 --> 14:02.759
- Is it his--

14:00.006 --> 14:02.759
- Stop.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.761
If you must love me..

14:04.803 --> 14:07.388
...love me for my I..

14:07.430 --> 14:09.223
my I..

14:07.430 --> 14:09.223
I'm in a bath towel.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.351
I'm in a bath towel here.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.436
Come on, Jess.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.436
What is the problem?

14:13.478 --> 14:15.772
- It's not working, okay?

14:13.478 --> 14:15.772
- He's right, it's not working.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.692
- Thank you.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.692
- That towel is much too big.

14:18.733 --> 14:22.153
Wait, hold, cut, cut.

14:18.733 --> 14:22.153
Not you, not you. Whoa!

14:22.195 --> 14:23.822
- I won't hurt you.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.822
- 'Whoa!'

14:23.863 --> 14:26.324
Malatesta, can you

14:23.863 --> 14:26.324
help me out here, please?

14:26.366 --> 14:27.367
She is the client.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.576
She's chasing me with scissors.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.745
So stop running.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.997
I'll not stand here

14:30.787 --> 14:32.997
and be exploited by you.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.542
Katsopolis, as long as

14:33.039 --> 14:35.542
you're working for me

14:35.583 --> 14:37.585
you'll do exactly

14:35.583 --> 14:37.585
what she says.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.963
Okay, from now on

14:37.627 --> 14:40.963
we don't work for you.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.090
- We quit!

14:41.005 --> 14:43.090
- You're making a big mistake.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.592
No, no, no, the biggest mistake

14:43.132 --> 14:44.592
I ever made was

14:44.634 --> 14:46.469
working for

14:44.634 --> 14:46.469
a spineless jellyfish like you.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.262
What?

14:48.304 --> 14:51.391
Uh, sir, you know, uh, uh,

14:48.304 --> 14:51.391
in many parts of the world

14:51.432 --> 14:54.477
a-a spineless jellyfish

14:51.432 --> 14:54.477
is considered a delicacy.

14:55.729 --> 14:56.771
Let's go.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.565
You're a good man, Gladstone.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.983
You know just when to kiss up.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.781
- I am a kiss-up, aren't I?

15:04.278 --> 15:06.781
- One of the best.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.912
- I sold you out, didn't I?

15:09.409 --> 15:12.912
- Joey, you hosed me down.

15:14.372 --> 15:17.333
We're partners...and friends.

15:22.463 --> 15:25.717
This man is not a hamburger..

15:25.759 --> 15:28.261
and I am not

15:25.759 --> 15:28.261
a side of fries

15:28.302 --> 15:31.097
and you, sir,

15:28.302 --> 15:31.097
are a..

15:31.138 --> 15:33.266
...Chicken McNugget.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.561
Joey, are you gonna quit

15:33.307 --> 15:36.561
or order a Happy Meal?

15:36.603 --> 15:39.272
- We're quitting.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.272
- That's my partner.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.399
Come on, we got

15:39.313 --> 15:41.399
better places to be.

15:42.901 --> 15:45.695
We just lost our jobs.

15:42.901 --> 15:45.695
Where are we going?

15:45.737 --> 15:47.238
Career Day.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.159
Thank you, Mr. Kraus,

15:50.157 --> 15:52.159
for introducing us

15:52.201 --> 15:55.747
to the wonderful world of meat.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.792
And now, as we move in to

15:55.789 --> 15:58.792
the field of TV entertainment

15:58.833 --> 16:00.126
I'd like to apologize once again

16:00.167 --> 16:02.336
for the unfortunate

16:00.167 --> 16:02.336
Connie Chung incident.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.130
[all exclaim]

16:04.964 --> 16:06.591
But just as exciting

16:06.633 --> 16:09.260
we have the co-hosts of

16:06.633 --> 16:09.260
"Wake Up, San Francisco."

16:09.302 --> 16:10.970
Let's give it up

16:09.302 --> 16:10.970
for Danny Tanner

16:11.011 --> 16:12.764
and Rebecca Donaldson!

16:12.806 --> 16:17.393
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

16:12.806 --> 16:17.393
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo..

16:17.435 --> 16:19.938
Who are right here.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.274
Wake up, Van Atta Junior High.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.274
I'm Danny Tanner.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.984
And I'm Rebecca Donaldson.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.987
And this is basically what

16:25.025 --> 16:27.987
we do, we talk to each other.

16:28.028 --> 16:31.198
And to our guests,

16:28.028 --> 16:31.198
and we listen, and we..

16:31.240 --> 16:32.992
Finish

16:31.240 --> 16:32.992
each other's sentences.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.911
[laughs]

16:36.830 --> 16:39.415
Okay, now,

16:36.830 --> 16:39.415
looking as I am right now

16:39.457 --> 16:42.126
at your beautiful, shiny,

16:39.457 --> 16:42.126
round little faces

16:42.168 --> 16:44.420
I'm reminded

16:42.168 --> 16:44.420
of my first job in television.

16:44.462 --> 16:48.132
I was assistant stock boy

16:44.462 --> 16:48.132
in Antenna Town.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.050
And you know,

16:48.174 --> 16:50.050
it reminds me of a long story--

16:50.092 --> 16:52.470
Danny, look,

16:50.092 --> 16:52.470
our first question.

16:52.512 --> 16:56.015
How tall

16:52.512 --> 16:56.015
is Connie Chung?

16:56.056 --> 16:58.184
Connie Chung

16:56.056 --> 16:58.184
is not here, I am and..

16:58.225 --> 17:00.895
...I'm 6'4.

16:58.225 --> 17:00.895
Thanks a lot.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.981
Yeah, but if she were here,

17:00.937 --> 17:02.981
how tall would she be?

17:03.063 --> 17:04.732
- Who does Connie's hair?

17:03.063 --> 17:04.732
- Yes?

17:04.774 --> 17:07.527
[all clamoring]

17:07.568 --> 17:09.362
That's it.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.362
Let's face it.

17:09.403 --> 17:12.448
Connie Chung couldn't make it,

17:09.403 --> 17:12.448
so just get over it.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.036
Oh, look who's here.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.746
From the exciting world

17:17.077 --> 17:18.746
of advertising

17:18.788 --> 17:20.874
Jesse Katsopolis

17:18.788 --> 17:20.874
and Joey Gladstone.

17:20.915 --> 17:22.416
Come on down.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.005
- Thanks, guys.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.005
- "Thanks, guys?"

17:27.046 --> 17:30.466
That's it for me and Rebecca?

17:27.046 --> 17:30.466
The butcher had ten minutes.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.510
Sorry, dad,

17:30.508 --> 17:32.510
but class is almost over

17:32.552 --> 17:34.637
and the butcher

17:32.552 --> 17:34.637
gave out midget salamis.

17:36.639 --> 17:37.932
Hey, I'm not

17:36.639 --> 17:37.932
above bribes.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.600
In fact, maybe

17:37.974 --> 17:39.600
these kids would like

17:39.642 --> 17:41.185
some autographed pictures of me.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.185
I brought the pictures.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.729
And I have a special felt marker

17:41.227 --> 17:42.729
and everything.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.023
Danny, it's over.

17:46.649 --> 17:49.193
Take it away, boys.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.987
- Thank you. Thank you.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.987
- Thank you.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.739
- Thanks.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.739
- Thank you.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.035
Hi.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.037
You know, when you really stop

17:57.076 --> 17:59.037
and think about it

17:59.078 --> 18:02.081
this whole career thing

17:59.078 --> 18:02.081
is overrated.

18:02.122 --> 18:04.333
I mean, there are

18:02.122 --> 18:04.333
more important things in life.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.835
Right, Joey?

18:05.877 --> 18:08.128
Sure,

18:05.877 --> 18:08.128
like a well-balanced breakfast.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.883
Right, and, uh,

18:08.170 --> 18:11.883
uh, really cool sunglasses.

18:11.925 --> 18:15.135
Yeah, and strong water pressure

18:11.925 --> 18:15.135
in the shower.

18:15.177 --> 18:18.097
- That's a good one.

18:15.177 --> 18:18.097
- Yeah. That would be.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.600
Did you guys

18:18.138 --> 18:20.600
lose your jobs or something?

18:20.641 --> 18:22.101
Zip it, Gibbler.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.772
We have something much more

18:23.811 --> 18:25.772
important than jobs.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.566
- Yeah.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.566
- We have our integrity.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.317
How much does that

18:28.608 --> 18:30.317
pay an hour?

18:30.359 --> 18:32.946
[bell rings]

18:32.987 --> 18:36.074
So remember, kids, always

18:32.987 --> 18:36.074
keep your heads held high

18:36.115 --> 18:38.701
and always carry

18:36.115 --> 18:38.701
exact bus change

18:38.743 --> 18:41.913
and remember, no running

18:38.743 --> 18:41.913
in the hallways.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.166
I think

18:44.040 --> 18:46.166
you really moved them.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.089
I feel so bad for you guys.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.089
What happened?

18:51.130 --> 18:54.675
Oh, our boss just

18:51.130 --> 18:54.675
pushed us too far. We quit.

18:56.135 --> 19:00.347
Look, I'm the last one

18:56.135 --> 19:00.347
to give advice.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.725
Okay, I'm the first one,

19:00.389 --> 19:02.725
but maybe you guys should go

19:02.767 --> 19:04.226
into business for yourselves.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.020
You could write

19:04.268 --> 19:06.020
and market your own commercials

19:06.062 --> 19:08.188
and direct them

19:06.062 --> 19:08.188
for your own production company.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.149
Yeah, we just learned

19:08.230 --> 19:10.149
about this.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.359
Why don't you guys

19:10.190 --> 19:12.359
get a small business loan?

19:12.401 --> 19:15.195
That's a great idea, I mean,

19:12.401 --> 19:15.195
you've got the experience

19:15.237 --> 19:16.990
the talent,

19:15.237 --> 19:16.990
the contacts.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.741
All you need is

19:17.031 --> 19:18.741
to rent some equipment.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.451
And find

19:18.783 --> 19:20.451
some studio space.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.536
And print up

19:20.493 --> 19:22.536
some business cards.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.123
- That's it.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.123
- You're in business.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.874
Congratulations.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.793
We have our own business.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.628
What the hell

19:28.835 --> 19:30.628
just happened?

19:34.841 --> 19:37.176
Tissue, tissue, tissue.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.805
Achoo!

19:40.847 --> 19:42.431
Thank you.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.309
How rude!

19:45.351 --> 19:48.938
You gave me your cold.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.938
Take it back.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.481
No can do.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.275
Once it's out of my nose,

19:50.523 --> 19:53.275
it's out of my hands.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.531
- Hi, girls.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.531
- 'Hi, Joey.'

19:58.572 --> 20:00.158
(Michelle)

19:58.572 --> 20:00.158
'Hi, Joey.'

20:02.785 --> 20:04.120
How are you, Michelle?

20:04.162 --> 20:05.997
She makes me sick.

20:07.331 --> 20:10.168
What she means is,

20:07.331 --> 20:10.168
I gave her my cold.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.586
Well, I'm sorry you got

20:10.209 --> 20:12.586
Stephie's cold

20:12.628 --> 20:14.130
but you know the good news?

20:14.172 --> 20:16.382
Since you took

20:14.172 --> 20:16.382
such good care of Stephie

20:16.423 --> 20:20.594
I'm sure Stephie's gonna take

20:16.423 --> 20:20.594
really good care of you.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.681
- Right, Steph?

20:20.636 --> 20:23.681
- Nice guilt trip, Joey.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.184
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

20:26.225 --> 20:27.727
Bye, girls.

20:30.897 --> 20:36.110

20:36.152 --> 20:37.820
Chill out, dude.

20:41.574 --> 20:45.786
Hey, Joey, I got bad news

20:41.574 --> 20:45.786
for Double J Creative Services.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.788
The bank turned down

20:45.828 --> 20:47.788
our business loan.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.582
- How could they do that?

20:47.830 --> 20:49.582
- Oh, I don't know.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.834
Maybe 'cause we've no experience

20:49.623 --> 20:51.834
running our own business

20:51.876 --> 20:53.836
no collateral,

20:51.876 --> 20:53.836
no credit rating.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.255
Why do you think

20:53.878 --> 20:56.255
they turned us down?

20:56.296 --> 20:58.132
Hey, just 'cause

20:56.296 --> 20:58.132
you're cranky and unemployed

20:58.174 --> 21:01.010
don't take it out on me.

21:01.052 --> 21:03.470
Guys, I heard about

21:01.052 --> 21:03.470
what happened at the bank.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.514
And I think I have a way

21:03.512 --> 21:05.514
to make you feel better.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.016
No, don't tell me

21:05.556 --> 21:07.016
that you're gonna sing

21:07.058 --> 21:09.309
"The Impossible Dream" again.

21:09.351 --> 21:14.107
No. I'm just gonna hum it

21:40.258 --> 21:42.093
Why are you giving us

21:40.258 --> 21:42.093
all this money?

21:42.135 --> 21:43.928
Because I believe

21:42.135 --> 21:43.928
in you guys.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.055
After all you've done for me,

21:43.970 --> 21:46.055
I'm happy to do this for you.

21:46.097 --> 21:48.390
But this, this is not a gift,

21:46.097 --> 21:48.390
it's an investment.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.976
I wanna be a partner

21:48.432 --> 21:49.976
in your success.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.811
Danny, this is beautiful.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.938
Oh, that's a lot of money.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.938
You're so..

21:53.980 --> 21:55.898
Did you say partner?

21:55.940 --> 21:57.608
Well, silent partner.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.401
Come on, what do you say?

21:57.650 --> 21:59.401
I'll be totally close mouthed.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.908
Danny, if you'd shut up for one

22:03.072 --> 22:05.908
