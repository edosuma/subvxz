15:55.520 --> 15:56.509
For what?

15:57.990 --> 15:59.184
To get up
out of here.

16:05.060 --> 16:06.687
We don't need money
to move out of here.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.959
Baby, when you
started GenCoin,

16:13.040 --> 16:17.830
you know I was the first person
to tell you that you was out
your damn mind.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.104
You remember?

16:19.940 --> 16:21.407
I remember.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.540
And then when you and Touie
got Araknet up and runnin', I...

16:26.010 --> 16:28.672
All I saw was the same thing
'bout to happen.

16:30.350 --> 16:32.989
But I missed
somethin', baby.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.652
I missed what it
was dOIn' for you.

16:35.890 --> 16:37.323
And for Touie.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.849
You weren't just tryin'
to change this hood.

16:40.930 --> 16:43.569
You was tryin'
to change you.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.061
And the way
people see you.

16:47.170 --> 16:48.797
You can ask
anybody now,

16:48.870 --> 16:50.269
black, white,
Haitian.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.069
They all gonna say
the same thing.

16:52.140 --> 16:55.371
Who Ronnie Dacey?
Ronnie Dacey is a thug.

16:58.410 --> 17:01.208
You take that money
from that buyout,
all you're gonna be

17:01.280 --> 17:02.770
is a rich thug.

17:09.760 --> 17:12.479
Let me show you
how soccer's supposed
to be played.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.389

17:14.460 --> 17:17.327
If Daddy didn't win,
you neither.

17:27.940 --> 17:29.669
Thank you.
Okay.

17:29.740 --> 17:32.709
STELLA: So, I was thinking
that this could be,
like, a really good

17:32.780 --> 17:34.042
living space.
Mmm-hmm.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.213
Like a living room
where we have people over.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.645
You know,
not typical.

17:40.020 --> 17:41.214
Come on.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.382

Stella. I don't...

17:46.830 --> 17:48.718
You deserve this.
It's a lot.
Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. We do. You do.
You should just...

17:50.500 --> 17:52.661
Live in a hotel.
No. Shut up. Come on.

17:52.730 --> 17:55.290
Come on, we gotta spend that
buyout money somehow, right?

17:55.370 --> 17:58.134
STELLA: Ignore the couch.
I was really thinking that

17:58.210 --> 18:01.008
this could be like
a live/work area for you.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.298
Like, your Office.

18:03.380 --> 18:05.177
I like that it
has a lot of
windows.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.445
You can have your desks,
the light will come in.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.978
Maybe something for me
over here. Maybe like
a little minibar.

18:11.050 --> 18:13.814
Just in case, you know,
you wanna come up
with something new.

18:13.890 --> 18:14.879
Yeah?
Yeah.

18:14.960 --> 18:15.949
What do
you think?

18:16.020 --> 18:17.282
Is that
what you want?

18:17.830 --> 18:19.354
Yeah.

18:19.430 --> 18:21.921
Yeah, don't you think
it'd be perfect?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.322
I can... We could...
We could get work done,
you know?

18:25.400 --> 18:26.526
You're lying.
Why?

18:26.600 --> 18:28.534
'Cause you're doing
this thing...

18:28.600 --> 18:30.306
Every time you're lying.
Oh, my God.

18:30.370 --> 18:31.564

you want?

18:33.710 --> 18:35.075

you mean?

18:36.210 --> 18:37.404
You know.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.803
What do you want,
Stells?

18:39.880 --> 18:42.110
Man up, stop doing things
