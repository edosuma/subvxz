WEBVTT

00:02.890 --> 00:05.645
Dave, look at all these hipsters.

00:05.670 --> 00:07.473
Are we cool enough to be here?

00:07.498 --> 00:09.281
Oh, yeah. Look, you know, Gemma,

00:09.306 --> 00:13.452
some people need mustaches
and suspenders to feel cool.

00:13.477 --> 00:15.188
Some of us are born with it.

00:17.654 --> 00:19.732
Hey, look, it's Marty over there.

00:19.757 --> 00:21.183
Oh, cool. Let's go say hi.

00:21.208 --> 00:22.706
Oh, no. I don't want to go bother him

00:22.731 --> 00:24.759
when he's out with his friends.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.779
On second thought, I don't
want to be impolite.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.210
Hey, Marty!

00:32.235 --> 00:34.505
Oh, uh, wow. Okay, this is a surprise.

00:34.530 --> 00:35.876
What are you guys doing here?

00:35.901 --> 00:37.855
We're just out for a
little date night fun.

00:38.380 --> 00:39.582
Marty,

00:39.607 --> 00:41.569
aren't you gonna introduce us?

00:41.594 --> 00:43.890
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, of course.

00:43.915 --> 00:46.156
Uh, this is Dave and Gemma.

00:46.181 --> 00:47.647
They live next door to my parents.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.044
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:49.069 --> 00:50.387
And this is

00:50.412 --> 00:51.913
Chloe, my girlfriend.

00:51.938 --> 00:53.250
Girlfriend?!

00:54.344 --> 00:55.687
Inside voice, Gemma.

00:55.712 --> 00:58.418
Okay, give me the deets.

00:58.443 --> 00:59.726
How'd you guys meet?

00:59.751 --> 01:01.904
We, uh, we were assigned

01:01.929 --> 01:03.203
on a project together at work.

01:03.228 --> 01:03.968
Aw.

01:03.993 --> 01:05.726
Oh, oh, so you're a scientist as well?

01:05.751 --> 01:08.094
I better be, or that
satellite's coming down.

01:09.540 --> 01:11.384
Well, it was great
bumping into you guys,

01:11.409 --> 01:13.750
but we were actually just about to go.

01:13.775 --> 01:15.633
I'm gonna run to the ladie"
room before we leave.

01:15.658 --> 01:16.826
Ooh! Me, too.

01:16.851 --> 01:18.162
Girl talk.

01:20.638 --> 01:22.187
So, I didn't know you had a girlfriend.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.137
Yeah. Yeah.

01:24.162 --> 01:25.459
You know who else doesn't know?

01:25.484 --> 01:26.566
My parents.

01:26.758 --> 01:29.191
So could you just, uh,
keep that kind of quiet?

01:29.216 --> 01:31.663
Sure. But why wouldn't you tell them?

01:31.688 --> 01:33.790
David.

01:34.032 --> 01:36.455
If my parents knew I was dating a
white girl, they would flip out.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.434
There's an old saying
in the black community:

01:38.459 --> 01:41.591
"If she can't use your comb,
you don't bring her home."

01:42.332 --> 01:43.965
Okay, look,

01:43.990 --> 01:46.513
you know your parents
way better than I do,

01:46.538 --> 01:47.959
but don't you think
keeping it from them

01:47.984 --> 01:49.672
is only gonna make it
worse if they find out?

01:49.859 --> 01:51.863
Yeah, you're probably right.

01:51.888 --> 01:53.570
So... you're gonna tell them?

01:53.595 --> 01:54.647
Oh, God, no.

01:54.672 --> 01:56.605
No. No, no, no.

01:56.630 --> 01:59.434
Uh, but you aren't gonna
tell them either, right?

01:59.459 --> 02:02.066
No. Your secret is safe with me.

02:02.091 --> 02:03.591
What about Gemma?

02:03.816 --> 02:06.705
Oh, my God, I love her.

02:06.730 --> 02:08.651
You guys are gonna have
the cutest babies.

02:08.676 --> 02:10.053
Oh.

02:11.428 --> 02:13.426
- Ready?
- Yeah.

02:13.451 --> 02:15.584
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

02:15.609 --> 02:16.640
I'll tell them tomorrow.

02:16.665 --> 02:18.023
Good.

02:21.042 --> 02:22.452
Uh, hey, guys.

02:22.477 --> 02:25.018
Oh, hey, baby. I didn't
know you were stopping by.

02:25.043 --> 02:27.588
I didn't know men wore pink pants.

02:29.006 --> 02:31.805
Wearing pink doesn't make
you less of a man, Pop.

02:31.830 --> 02:33.761
Yeah, besides, Dad, they're
not pink, they're salmon.

02:33.786 --> 02:36.216
Yeah, that's not helping
your case, bro.

02:37.097 --> 02:38.748
Well, baby, what brings you by?

02:38.773 --> 02:41.420
Well, uh, there's something I
need to talk to you guys about.

02:41.445 --> 02:43.315
Oh, "need to talk" is never good news.

02:43.340 --> 02:45.468
Either somebody pregnant
or he going to jail.

02:47.009 --> 02:48.600
Is everything all right, Marty?

02:48.625 --> 02:51.228
No, everything's fine. In
fact, everything's great.

02:51.253 --> 02:53.520
- Oh
- Uh, I just wanted to tell you guys

02:53.545 --> 02:55.230
that I have a girlfriend.

02:55.808 --> 02:57.292
You do?

02:57.317 --> 02:59.114
Has she seen those pants?

03:00.875 --> 03:02.701
Oh, that's wonderful, baby.

03:02.726 --> 03:04.871
You know what? I've been
praying that you find someone.

03:04.896 --> 03:06.028
Yeah, man, who is she?

03:06.053 --> 03:09.105
Well, her name is Chloe,
and I really like her.

03:09.561 --> 03:11.520
So why were you nervous
to tell us that?

03:11.545 --> 03:12.387
Yeah.

03:12.779 --> 03:14.564
Well, uh...

03:16.270 --> 03:18.901
let's just say I've been
playing in the snow lately.

03:25.228 --> 03:26.964
- What?
- What? What?

03:27.310 --> 03:29.632
I've been sprinkling a
lot of powdered sugar

03:29.657 --> 03:31.136
on my French toast.

03:32.797 --> 03:34.497
Well, you know, you got to watch that,

03:34.522 --> 03:37.054
'cause we got a lot of
diabetes run in our family.

03:37.079 --> 03:38.820
You got to be careful.

03:38.845 --> 03:41.024
No, no. Dad, listen, um,

03:41.049 --> 03:43.846
I set a trap in the woods
and I caught a polar bear.

03:43.871 --> 03:45.648
You're dating a white girl?

03:45.673 --> 03:48.677
Yes!

03:50.058 --> 03:51.883
Well, who cares if she's white,

03:51.908 --> 03:53.908
as long as Marty likes her, right?

03:53.933 --> 03:55.933
I'm just trying to
protect the boy, babe.

03:56.364 --> 03:59.222
You know how intolerant
people can be about color.

03:59.247 --> 04:00.998
Oh, like you and his pink pants?

04:01.894 --> 04:04.073
And besides, don't we have

04:04.098 --> 04:05.676
enough white people around here now?

04:05.701 --> 04:09.035
I mean, with the Johnsons
and now this girl,

04:09.189 --> 04:10.893
it's starting to feel like Connecticut.

04:12.138 --> 04:14.282
Well, I, for one, want to meet her.

04:14.307 --> 04:15.964
So why don't you invite
her over tomorrow night

04:15.989 --> 04:18.724
- for Sunday dinner?
- Oh, I don't know, Mom.

04:18.749 --> 04:20.637
You know, we've only been
dating for a couple months.

04:20.663 --> 04:21.962
It might be a bit too soon.

04:21.987 --> 04:24.221
Oh, maybe I didn't make myself clear.

04:24.246 --> 04:25.648
She's coming over for Sunday dinner,

04:25.673 --> 04:27.743
and if you're free, you're
welcome to come, too.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.275
Wha...

04:30.525 --> 04:33.031
And give your girlfriend
her pants back.

04:38.072 --> 04:42.045
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:44.140 --> 04:46.943
I am so excited for you to meet Chloe.

04:46.968 --> 04:48.263
Thank you for inviting us.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.787
Oh, my pleasure.

04:49.812 --> 04:53.385
Maybe with you guys here,
Calvin will give her a chance.

04:53.410 --> 04:54.954
Why would us being here matter?

04:54.979 --> 04:57.695
Well, next to Dave, maybe
she won't seem so white.

05:00.045 --> 05:03.309
Hey, DJ Calvin, can I make a request?

05:04.770 --> 05:06.526
No, but I can give you one.

05:06.551 --> 05:08.296
Go stand over there.

05:09.328 --> 05:11.744
Okay, look, I know you're not happy

05:11.769 --> 05:13.979
with Marty's choice, but at
least he was brave enough

05:14.004 --> 05:14.999
to tell you the truth.

05:15.358 --> 05:18.001
The truth is, is when he
comes in here with Chloe,

05:18.026 --> 05:19.178
the white people in my house

05:19.203 --> 05:20.819
are gonna outnumber the black people.

05:20.844 --> 05:23.687
Wait. What?

05:23.712 --> 05:25.196
It'll be four and four.

05:25.221 --> 05:27.465
You're so white, I count you twice.

05:30.303 --> 05:32.791
Your dad seems grumpier than usual.

05:32.816 --> 05:34.561
That's because Marty is challenging him

05:34.586 --> 05:36.319
to expand his point of view.

05:36.344 --> 05:37.604
What does that mean?

05:37.629 --> 05:40.031
Well, that means, for the
first time in a long time,

05:40.056 --> 05:41.741
I'm the favorite son.

05:43.589 --> 05:45.393
Love you, boy.

05:47.495 --> 05:50.006
Uh, hey, guys. We're here.

05:50.031 --> 05:52.404
Hey, baby. So glad you could make it.

05:52.429 --> 05:54.719
So, you must be Chloe.

05:54.744 --> 05:56.954
I am Marty's mother, Tina.
Nice to meet you.

05:56.979 --> 05:58.474
It's nice to meet you, too, Mrs.
Butler.

05:58.499 --> 05:59.420
Here. These are for you.

05:59.445 --> 06:02.741
Flowers today, grandbabies tomorrow!

06:03.880 --> 06:05.646
It's good to see you again, Chloe.

06:05.671 --> 06:08.347
You remember my wife,
your bathroom bestie.

06:09.820 --> 06:10.452
Oh.

06:10.477 --> 06:12.555
And this is my father, Calvin.

06:12.739 --> 06:14.232
Hello.

06:14.257 --> 06:15.827
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Butler.

06:15.852 --> 06:17.523
Marty's told me a lot about you.

06:17.548 --> 06:18.614
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.640
He's only told us one thing about you.

06:21.814 --> 06:24.190
Dad, come on. It's okay.

06:24.215 --> 06:25.127
He's being funny.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.485
Now I see where Marty
gets his sense of humor.

06:28.189 --> 06:29.755
Oh, wow!

06:29.780 --> 06:31.773
Look at this vinyl collection.

06:31.798 --> 06:33.398
Oh, you like listening to records?

06:33.423 --> 06:35.448
Yeah, they just sound so much warmer.

06:35.473 --> 06:39.439
Ooh, hey, uh, just a piece of
advice: don't make any requests.

06:40.545 --> 06:42.575
So, Chloe, where are you from?

06:42.600 --> 06:44.682
Here. Born and raised in Los Angeles.

06:44.707 --> 06:45.970
Mm, let me guess.

06:45.995 --> 06:47.871
Bel Air? Beverly Hills?

06:47.896 --> 06:49.248
Malibu?

06:49.977 --> 06:51.926
Echo Park, actually.

06:51.951 --> 06:53.817
Oh, that's near Dodger Stadium.

06:53.842 --> 06:55.508
Yeah! Are you a fan?

06:55.533 --> 06:58.722
Oh, I've been going to games
since Tommy Lasorda was skinny.

07:00.142 --> 07:03.703
You know, my family has season tickets.

07:03.728 --> 07:06.036
Maybe you can come to a game
with Marty and me sometime.

07:06.061 --> 07:09.039
Season tickets? Wh-Where are the seats?

07:09.064 --> 07:11.419
Field level, first base side.

07:11.444 --> 07:13.130
Field level.

07:13.897 --> 07:17.269
I have been hit in the
face by a foul ball twice.

07:17.294 --> 07:19.820
Well, all right!

07:22.235 --> 07:25.237
Aw, damn. There goes my
"favorite son" position.

07:25.425 --> 07:28.012
Maybe you should get
a white girlfriend.

07:34.266 --> 07:35.698
Where should I sit?

07:35.723 --> 07:38.305
Why don't you sit here next to me,

07:38.485 --> 07:41.636
just like we're gonna do
at those Dodger games.

07:42.892 --> 07:45.043
So, I guess we're all set.

07:45.068 --> 07:46.907
You good over there,
Grover and Malcolm?

07:46.932 --> 07:48.521
Yeah, Ma!

07:50.621 --> 07:52.441
I'm doing great.

07:52.746 --> 07:55.424
When you fall, you fall hard.

07:57.204 --> 08:00.273
Okay, so, before we eat, I
just want to thank everyone

08:00.298 --> 08:02.355
for being here, especially you, Chloe.

08:02.380 --> 08:03.646
Oh, and since you're our guest,

08:03.671 --> 08:05.805
why don't you go ahead
and lead us in grace.

08:05.830 --> 08:08.138
Never asked me to say grace.

08:08.724 --> 08:10.974
Oh. Um...

08:10.999 --> 08:13.208
Uh, you know, Dad, that-that's
really nice of you,

08:13.233 --> 08:15.683
but I think it might be a lot
of pressure to put on Chloe.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.138
Maybe someone else should do it.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.559
Love to. Okay, let's all hold hands.

08:19.584 --> 08:21.634
Dave. Dave.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.695
Aw, don't feel any pressure.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.588
God doesn't need anything fancy.

08:26.613 --> 08:28.594
It's not that I feel too much pressure.

08:28.619 --> 08:30.760
Uh, I just think it might
be more appropriate

08:30.785 --> 08:32.205
if someone else did it.

08:32.230 --> 08:33.280
Ooh, again, all over it.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.013
Okay... Dave.

08:34.038 --> 08:36.655
Dave, Dave, Dave.

08:37.164 --> 08:39.673
Well, why wouldn't it
be appropriate for you?

08:40.215 --> 08:41.816
Well, because I don't believe in God.

08:41.841 --> 08:43.347
Mm-mm.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.391
I see.

08:51.416 --> 08:54.449
And just like Jesus, I'm risen again.

09:02.155 --> 09:04.714
Food's delicious, Mrs. Butler.

09:04.881 --> 09:07.000
Yeah, you know, Mom,
Chloe's quite a cook, too.

09:07.025 --> 09:10.018
Mm, she likes the Dodgers
and she can burn?

09:10.980 --> 09:13.215
She'll be burning, all right.

09:16.778 --> 09:19.860
Uh, so, Chloe, what kind
of scientist are you?

09:19.885 --> 09:21.499
I'm an astrophysicist.

09:21.524 --> 09:23.744
I'd say it's not rocket science, but...

09:23.769 --> 09:25.092
it's basically rocket science.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.338
Girl's funny, huh?

09:32.245 --> 09:35.267
I would like to hear why
you don't believe in God.

09:36.514 --> 09:38.420
Well, it's just that, as a scientist,

09:38.445 --> 09:40.608
I have to go where the facts lead me,

09:40.633 --> 09:43.800
and... there's no empirical
evidence of a higher power.

09:43.825 --> 09:44.891
Hmm.

09:44.916 --> 09:45.857
Hmm.

09:46.192 --> 09:48.378
That's an interesting opinion.
Don't you th...?

09:48.403 --> 09:50.873
Y-Yeah, it sure is. Right, Dave?

09:50.898 --> 09:52.753
Absolutely. Malcolm, what do you think?

09:52.778 --> 09:54.744
Oh, I think it's great.

09:57.229 --> 09:59.822
So if you got some empirical evidence,

09:59.847 --> 10:01.671
- would you believe?
- Sure.

10:01.696 --> 10:02.343
Oh.

10:02.368 --> 10:03.530
But I don't think there's ever gonna be

10:03.555 --> 10:06.454
any evidence of an old, bearded
man who lives in the sky,

10:06.479 --> 10:08.669
granting wishes like it's magic.

10:15.888 --> 10:17.453
"Like it's magic"?

10:17.478 --> 10:19.696
You know what's magical
is Tina's desserts.

10:20.426 --> 10:21.804
You know, baby,

10:21.829 --> 10:23.509
I will go get it ready.

10:23.534 --> 10:25.921
Marty, would you come help
me in the kitchen, please?

10:25.946 --> 10:27.081
You know, Malcolm could...

10:27.106 --> 10:28.543
Marty!

10:33.604 --> 10:36.683
That was going great till you
found out Chloe was a heathen.

10:37.712 --> 10:39.884
Martin Lawrence Butler.

10:42.026 --> 10:44.805
What are you doing with a girl
who doesn't believe in God?

10:44.830 --> 10:46.295
Just because she doesn't believe in God

10:46.320 --> 10:47.853
doesn't mean she's not a good person.

10:47.878 --> 10:49.173
I didn't say she wasn't.

10:49.198 --> 10:50.708
So you think she's a good person?

10:50.733 --> 10:53.706
Of course I don't! She
doesn't believe in God!

10:54.943 --> 10:56.421
How can you be so judgmental?

10:56.446 --> 10:58.407
The Bible says, "Judge
not, lest you be judged.

10:58.432 --> 11:00.571
Oh, whoa. Don't you throw
scripture at me, boy.

11:00.596 --> 11:03.491
I am your mother. And the Bible
says I can judge whoever I want.

11:03.686 --> 11:05.349
Tell me where it says that.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.417
First Corinthians, Second Tina.

11:08.151 --> 11:10.052
It's my favorite verse.

11:10.576 --> 11:12.351
See? I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

11:12.376 --> 11:14.234
No, no, where do you
think you're going?

11:14.307 --> 11:15.723
- We're leaving.
- Oh, no.

11:15.748 --> 11:18.082
You're gonna stay here, and
you're gonna listen to me.

11:18.107 --> 11:20.282
Why, when you won't listen to me?

11:20.730 --> 11:22.704
Fine. Leave.

11:22.729 --> 11:25.752
She wouldn't like dessert
anyway; it's angel food cake!

11:31.035 --> 11:33.012
Hey, Calvin, are you
changing the oil again?

11:33.037 --> 11:34.303
Yeah.

11:34.328 --> 11:35.894
Didn't you do that last week?

11:35.919 --> 11:37.706
Stop stalking me, Dave.

11:39.144 --> 11:41.645
I already got enough on my
plate with this Tina thing.

11:41.670 --> 11:43.941
Ooh. She's still upset
about Marty, huh?

11:43.966 --> 11:46.480
Yeah. And now she's upset with me.

11:46.505 --> 11:47.738
Why?

11:47.843 --> 11:50.623
Because she thinks I
should be mad, too.

11:51.850 --> 11:54.454
To be honest, I'm a little
surprised you're not.

11:54.479 --> 11:56.181
There's nothing to be mad at.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.642
The boy's just having fun.
They're just dating.

11:58.667 --> 12:02.204
But Tina act like they're
all at the altar already.

12:02.480 --> 12:06.003
Well, you were upset when you
found out she was white.

12:06.028 --> 12:08.370
I've grown, Dave.

12:09.939 --> 12:11.566
I don't see black or white.

12:11.591 --> 12:13.816
All I see is Dodger blue.

12:16.031 --> 12:17.367
Well, you know me.

12:17.783 --> 12:20.782
I don't like sticking my nose
in other people's business.

12:22.205 --> 12:25.218
But if you want, I have some advice.

12:25.497 --> 12:28.852
Fine. Go ahead, get it off your chest.

12:28.877 --> 12:31.709
Ooh. Give me a second. I
wasn't expecting that.

12:32.351 --> 12:34.027
Okay.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.989
I discovered something
years ago with Gemma

12:37.014 --> 12:38.613
when we were watching <i>The Bachelor.</i>

12:38.638 --> 12:40.504
I take it back. I don't
want to hear this.

12:40.859 --> 12:43.321
No, no, it's too late; train
has already left the station.

12:43.346 --> 12:47.897
Now, Gemma was livid when Ben
picked Ashley over Trisha.

12:48.193 --> 12:53.401
Oh, she was yelling at the TV,
she was beating up pillows,

12:53.426 --> 12:57.639
and the more I tried to calm
her down, the madder she got.

12:58.082 --> 13:00.334
Mad? Like I'm getting right now?

13:00.763 --> 13:04.004
What I realized is that Gemma
didn't want to be calmed down,

13:04.029 --> 13:07.107
she wanted someone to be mad with her.

13:07.313 --> 13:08.998
Okay. So what did you do?

13:09.023 --> 13:10.646
Well, I went ballistic.

13:11.766 --> 13:14.162
You know? I yelled, I threw the remote,

13:14.187 --> 13:17.233
posted tirades on all
the <i> Bachelor</i> blogs.

13:18.399 --> 13:19.839
I was an animal.

13:21.085 --> 13:22.674
How did any of that help?

13:22.699 --> 13:25.514
Because once I started
acting more mad than her,

13:25.539 --> 13:28.340
she felt like she
needed to calm me down,

13:28.365 --> 13:32.299
which required her to calm down.

13:33.717 --> 13:35.523
And then, Calvin, we made love.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.956
Okay.

13:37.452 --> 13:39.355
Keep me out of your bedroom, Dave.

13:39.380 --> 13:42.797
Ooh. It was not in the bedroom.

13:43.982 --> 13:46.529
I don't care if it was
in Dodger Stadium.

13:46.554 --> 13:48.779
Keep it to yourself!

13:53.791 --> 13:55.159
Hey, baby.

13:55.184 --> 13:56.584
Uh, I...

13:56.609 --> 13:58.386
I think those pillows are clean.

13:59.780 --> 14:02.506
Don't "baby" me. Where you been?

14:03.531 --> 14:05.885
Uh, I'll tell you where I been.

14:05.910 --> 14:09.374
I been... I been walking the streets,

14:09.399 --> 14:12.285
angry, thinking about
that Marty situation.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.220
Oh, really?

14:14.245 --> 14:16.934
So now you care, Mr. Field Level Seats?

14:16.959 --> 14:18.950
Yeah. No, but you're right, Tina.

14:18.975 --> 14:21.912
I got to admit, I was
blinded by the Dodger blue.

14:22.160 --> 14:25.639
But, uh, you know, the
more I think about it,

14:25.892 --> 14:29.310
I couldn't have got upset,
'cause if I would've got mad,

14:29.335 --> 14:32.436
I would've had to unleash the beast
up in here, you know what I mean?

14:32.673 --> 14:34.907
- Well, it's about time, Calvin.
- Yeah.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.280
And I'm mad, Tina. Uh-huh.

14:36.305 --> 14:38.496
- I mean, I'm furious!
- Mm-hmm.

14:38.521 --> 14:41.502
That's right! That's right!

14:41.527 --> 14:43.893
- Who does that boy think he is?!
- You're right, baby!

14:43.918 --> 14:45.669
You know what, I'm gonna
flip this couch right now!

14:45.694 --> 14:46.927
Wait, what?

14:46.952 --> 14:48.308
Baby, no, no, no, no.

14:48.333 --> 14:50.941
Whew! That couch a little heavy.
Let me start right here.

14:50.966 --> 14:52.097
No!

14:52.122 --> 14:53.383
Oh, no, no! Calvin!

14:53.408 --> 14:54.741
Wait a minute. Don't-don't-don't...

14:54.766 --> 14:56.390
I can't, baby. You
know what I'm saying?

14:56.415 --> 14:58.674
They done unleashed the kraken up
in here, as far as I'm concerned!

14:58.699 --> 15:00.605
Wait, wait, wait.

15:00.630 --> 15:02.314
Don't. Wait. Calvin, Calvin, Calvin!

15:02.339 --> 15:04.755
Wait a minute, just
calm down, calm down.

15:04.780 --> 15:06.777
It's gonna be okay. I
mean, we trippin'.

15:06.802 --> 15:07.984
You know what?

15:08.009 --> 15:09.633
You-you don't know what it's like.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.558
- To have all this pent-up anger.
- I know, baby.

15:11.583 --> 15:13.128
You don't know what to do with it.

15:13.153 --> 15:14.348
- Oh! Ooh!
- Oh!

15:14.373 --> 15:16.920
Oh, see, baby? Just, oh, just sit down.

15:16.945 --> 15:18.786
- Sit down, sit down. Come on, sit down.
- Yeah.

15:18.811 --> 15:20.472
- Sit down.
- Oh, man, I...

15:20.497 --> 15:22.330
You got to forgive me, girl, I...

15:22.355 --> 15:23.996
I lost my mind there for a second.

15:24.021 --> 15:25.607
- I know. I know.
- Yeah?

15:25.632 --> 15:26.825
Kids'll make you do that.

15:26.850 --> 15:28.301
- How you doing?
- Terrible.

15:28.326 --> 15:29.438
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

15:29.463 --> 15:30.468
I'm okay, baby.

15:30.493 --> 15:33.206
I think we both need to relax.

15:33.231 --> 15:34.230
- Yeah.
- You know?

15:34.255 --> 15:36.220
I mean, you know, the
fact that we was...

15:36.245 --> 15:38.881
we was both upset about
the same thing...

15:38.906 --> 15:40.964
- Same thing. It's our baby.
- You know,

15:40.989 --> 15:42.015
- It's our baby.
- You know...

15:42.041 --> 15:44.769
You know, but now, you
know, we're just chillin'.

15:44.794 --> 15:47.980
- Yeah, we chillin', baby.
- You know what I mean? Yeah.

15:56.878 --> 15:59.590
Calvin, why are you touching my butt?

16:00.929 --> 16:02.742
Oh, babe, I just...

16:02.767 --> 16:04.661
I thought since we
weren't angry anymore,

16:04.686 --> 16:07.761
we'd just get back to
our lovin' selves.

16:07.786 --> 16:09.571
Hmm?

16:09.596 --> 16:10.511
What?

16:10.536 --> 16:13.837
Were you pretending to be
mad just to get you some?

16:14.106 --> 16:16.564
What?! No!

16:16.589 --> 16:19.556
I cannot believe you. Here
I'm about to lose my baby,

16:19.581 --> 16:21.370
and you're trying to make another one?

16:22.093 --> 16:24.370
- Look, Tina...
- Oh, my God.

16:24.395 --> 16:26.464
I was just trying to
get you to calm down,

16:26.489 --> 16:27.269
- all right?
- Mm, mm.

16:27.294 --> 16:29.019
'Cause on The Bachelor,
Dave has said, what...

16:29.044 --> 16:29.519
What?

16:29.544 --> 16:31.542
Basically what happens
on <i> The Bachelor...</i>

16:31.567 --> 16:32.379
Dave?

16:32.404 --> 16:34.729
- Oh, hell no!
- Oh, Tina...

16:34.754 --> 16:36.081
You-you-you...

16:36.106 --> 16:37.917
Tina, don't you... Tina, you don't...

16:37.942 --> 16:39.999
- You...
- Come on, now, you know...

16:40.456 --> 16:42.934
You know, I'm not dealing
with this no more. What?

16:42.959 --> 16:46.229
- Tina, you need to stop...
- Come on, now, quit playing.

16:49.305 --> 16:50.621
Whew.

16:50.646 --> 16:52.624
That didn't go like I thought.

16:58.324 --> 16:59.952
Whoa!

17:02.019 --> 17:03.619
How did you get in here?

17:03.644 --> 17:05.077
Bobby pin.

17:05.268 --> 17:07.241
I wasn't always your mother.

17:09.271 --> 17:11.330
Sit down. We need to talk.

17:11.356 --> 17:12.824
If you're here to tell me

17:12.848 --> 17:14.441
to break up with Chloe,
you're too late.

17:15.506 --> 17:17.213
We already did.

17:24.541 --> 17:27.089
Oh, baby, you okay?

17:27.114 --> 17:29.114
Don't pretend like you're not happy.

17:29.579 --> 17:32.526
I heard your bracelets jingling
while you were celebrating.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.646
Okay, fine. I'm happy.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.638
I was just worried about
you being with someone

17:39.663 --> 17:41.470
who doesn't believe in God.

17:41.620 --> 17:44.233
What does it matter if she
doesn't as long as I do?

17:44.258 --> 17:47.550
So you do still believe in God?

17:47.575 --> 17:48.737
Of course I do.

17:49.317 --> 17:50.860
But my relationship to
God is personal to me.

17:50.885 --> 17:52.604
It doesn't have to be
the same as Chloe's,

17:52.629 --> 17:54.026
or yours.

17:54.253 --> 17:55.623
Listen, baby,

17:55.648 --> 17:58.743
I need you to understand me right now.

17:59.251 --> 18:02.619
Faith has been so important in my life.

18:02.876 --> 18:06.348
I mean, it's gotten me
through my mother passing,

18:07.058 --> 18:10.713
it got me through raising two
black sons in Los Angeles,

18:11.658 --> 18:12.873
and more importantly,

18:12.898 --> 18:15.415
it's still getting me through
being married to your father.

18:16.969 --> 18:20.669
Well, if Chloe wanted empirical
evidence of God, there it is.

18:22.510 --> 18:25.542
I just want to make sure that
you have the same foundation

18:25.567 --> 18:27.801
to build your life upon, you know?

18:28.053 --> 18:29.319
Of course I do.

18:29.764 --> 18:30.930
What do you think got me through

18:30.955 --> 18:33.716
being bullied in high
school for being a nerd?

18:33.741 --> 18:35.806
What do you think got me
through four years of college

18:35.831 --> 18:37.297
and two years of graduate school?

18:37.809 --> 18:39.723
What do you think got
me through being scared

18:39.748 --> 18:41.348
when I moved out on my own?

18:42.064 --> 18:44.055
Marty, I'm just worried.

18:45.429 --> 18:46.810
You're my baby.

18:46.972 --> 18:48.706
I know, Mama.

18:49.634 --> 18:52.457
But you raised me my whole
life to have faith.

18:52.898 --> 18:56.048
Now you need to have faith
that you did your job.

19:00.697 --> 19:02.216
Mm!

19:05.426 --> 19:07.431
So, what happened with you and Chloe?

19:07.456 --> 19:10.752
Ah. Well, we realized we
were better as friends.

19:10.939 --> 19:14.460
Wait, wait, wait. So... you
weren't really that serious?

19:15.112 --> 19:17.522
Well, why would you bring her home?!

19:18.446 --> 19:20.153
Because you made me!

19:20.178 --> 19:21.829
Well, boy, you're grown now.

19:21.854 --> 19:24.185
You got to learn to
start saying no to me.

19:34.130 --> 19:36.567
Calvin, you seem mad. Are you okay?

19:36.688 --> 19:38.423
No.

19:38.448 --> 19:40.342
Marty and Chloe broke up.

19:40.367 --> 19:42.855
Oh, no! Poor Marty.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.136
Marty? What about poor me?

19:45.840 --> 19:47.891
I justlost field level seats.

19:47.916 --> 19:49.808
Those come with a parking pass.

19:50.952 --> 19:53.214
You know what, Calvin? You're right.

19:53.239 --> 19:55.031
I liked that girl.

19:55.056 --> 19:57.019
I thought they were gonna
have pretty babies!

19:57.044 --> 19:58.616
Okay...

19:58.641 --> 20:00.232
Whoa, Gem-Gemma?

20:00.257 --> 20:02.127
You know, I just raked those.

20:03.252 --> 20:06.131
I can't help it, okay? I'm-I'm livid!

20:06.156 --> 20:07.617
My blood is boiling!

20:09.116 --> 20:11.788
She broke our hearts!
That girl needs to know,

20:11.813 --> 20:14.257
when you hurt a Butler,
you hurt a Johnson!

20:14.282 --> 20:16.863
Okay, whoa, Gemma, calm down!

20:17.848 --> 20:21.076
Don't tell me to calm down, Calvin!

20:22.563 --> 20:25.835
Gemma, let it go.
There'll be other girls.

20:27.318 --> 20:28.430
Okay.

20:28.455 --> 20:30.540
Okay, yeah. Oh, you're right.

20:30.565 --> 20:32.674
You're right. I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.506
Grover, come here. Let's go inside.
Sorry.

20:38.136 --> 20:39.360
Wow, Mom.

20:39.385 --> 20:40.913
You were really angry.

20:41.087 --> 20:44.435
No, sweetie, I was just helping Mr.
Calvin calm down.

20:44.460 --> 20:45.544
It's a little trick I use

20:45.569 --> 20:47.478
when your dad freaks
out over <i> The Bachelor.</i>
