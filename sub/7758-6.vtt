00:09.810 --> 00:11.210
- * ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR

00:11.245 --> 00:13.105
* ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, SIX *

00:13.147 --> 00:15.247
* TAKE IT, DUDE

[Greek Buck's Spunk]

00:18.286 --> 00:26.226
*

00:28.129 --> 00:29.729
* ONE, TWO, THREE

* ONE, TWO, THREE

00:34.168 --> 00:38.438
*

00:41.575 --> 00:42.675
- OKAY.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.110
SO I'M A GAY MAN
WITH A SUPERHERO FETISH.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.246
YES, WE'RE OUT THERE.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.320
AND, NO, IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IMMATURITY.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.420
I THINK WE GAY BOYS LEARN
IMPORTANT LESSONS

00:51.452 --> 00:53.222
FROM COMIC BOOKS.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.194
ONE--THERE ARE A LOT
OF VILLAINS OUT THERE,

00:55.223 --> 00:57.263
SO YOU BETTER DEVELOP
SOME SECRET POWERS.

00:57.291 --> 01:00.561
TWO--IF YOU HAVE A GOOD BODY,
YOU CAN WEAR TIGHT CLOTHES.

01:00.594 --> 01:04.703
AND THREE--IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
TO BE PART OF A DYNAMIC DUO.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.167
I TOTALLY BLEW IT.
- DON'T WORRY.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.843
THERE'S STILL PLENTY
OF CREEPY OLD MEN OUT THERE

01:10.871 --> 01:12.241
WHO'D LOVE TO GET
IN YOUR PANTS.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.573
- HE WASN'T THAT OLD.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.407
HE WASN'T CREEPY.
HE WAS NICE.

01:15.443 --> 01:16.583
MY FIRST DOCTOR.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.610
- CHIROPRACTOR.

01:17.645 --> 01:18.845
- THAT COUNTS...

01:18.879 --> 01:19.749
I THINK.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.180
- UH, WE GOT IN
THE NEW CATWOMAN.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.816
- COOL.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.821
HE TAKES ME
TO THIS REALLY NICE RESTAURANT.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.827
I BEHAVE
LIKE A FUCKING IDIOT--

01:31.859 --> 01:34.399
DRESSED UP LIKE
SOME SLICK ASSHOLE.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.598
- HEY, THAT WAS
MY $1,200 LEATHER JACKET.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.500
- IT WASN'T ME.

01:39.533 --> 01:40.803
YOU KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE I'M NOBODY.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.904
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.466
ARE YOU EVEN
LISTENING TO ME?

01:44.505 --> 01:48.505
- I TUNE OUT SELF-PITY.
IT MAKES MY DICK SOFT.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.752
AND WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT...

01:51.779 --> 01:53.909
WOULD WE?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.447
- JUST FORGET I SAID ANYTHING.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.483
- [clears throat]

01:56.517 --> 01:58.487
- OH, WOW.
LOOK.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.819
IT'S THE NEW
ELECTRA WOMAN DOLL.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.493
I'M GOING TO BUY THIS
FOR GUS.

02:01.522 --> 02:02.522
- DON'T.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.386
I DON'T WANT A GAY KID.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.255
- HE'S BEING RAISED
BY TWO LESBIANS.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.234
HE'S GOING TO NEED
A FEMININE INFLUENCE.

02:08.262 --> 02:13.202
BESIDES, IT'LL BE
A COLLECTOR'S ITEM.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.374
- WELL, I'LL TAKE IT.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.902
I'M GOING OVER THERE.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.236
- I'LL GO TOO.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.411
- NO.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.840
YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO THE DOCTOR.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.706
TELL HIM YOU WANT TO GIVE IT
ANOTHER TRY.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.859
- DOES YOUR MOM KNOW
YOU'RE OUT BUYING JEWELRY?

02:43.897 --> 02:45.667
- SHE'S TOTALLY COOL
WITH EVERYTHING,

02:45.699 --> 02:47.669
OR AT LEAST SHE'S PRETENDING
TO BE BECAUSE SHE'S SCARED

02:47.701 --> 02:49.601
I'LL RUN AWAY
AND BECOME A HAIRDRESSER.

02:49.637 --> 02:50.597
- I HATE YOU.

02:50.638 --> 02:51.808
MY MOM'S SUCH A BITCH,

02:51.839 --> 02:53.409
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN GIVEN HER
A REASON YET.

02:53.441 --> 02:54.781
- HOW ABOUT THESE?

02:54.808 --> 02:57.308
- THEY'RE TOTALLY QUEER.
- SHUT UP.

02:57.345 --> 03:02.375
THEY'RE A SYMBOL
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.546
- OKAY. THANKS.

03:05.586 --> 03:08.386
- ACTUALLY,
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.762
I HAD TO BUY
A NEW FAKE I.D.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.504
LOOK!
THAT'S THEM--

03:16.530 --> 03:19.370
BRIAN'S LESBIANS.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.411
HEY!

03:24.438 --> 03:25.708
HEY.

03:25.739 --> 03:26.769
HOW'S IT GOING?

03:26.807 --> 03:28.307
- I'M SORRY.
DO WE KNOW YOU?

03:28.342 --> 03:30.512
- I'M JUSTIN...

03:30.544 --> 03:31.684
BRIAN'S FRIEND.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.512
I WAS THERE THE NIGHT
GUS WAS BORN.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.517
I NAMED HIM.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.448
- YEAH.
- OH, RIGHT.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.394
SO, WHEN GUS ENDS UP
PUMPING GAS,

03:38.419 --> 03:39.449
WE'LL HAVE YOU TO THANK.

03:39.487 --> 03:40.947
- [laughs]

03:40.988 --> 03:42.988
- THIS IS DAPHNE.
- HI.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.693
I'M NOT A LESBIAN,
BUT I-I'M A BIG FAN.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.596
- [chuckles]

03:47.628 --> 03:48.858
- HE'S GOTTEN SO BIG ALREADY.

03:48.896 --> 03:49.726
- OH, WELL, YOU WOULD TOO

03:49.763 --> 03:51.573
IF ALL YOU DID WAS SLEEP
AND EAT ALL DAY.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.969
- HE DOES.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.600
- HE'S, LIKE, THE CUTEST BABY
I'VE EVER SEEN.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.035
IF YOU EVER NEED
A BABYSITTER--

03:56.069 --> 03:57.839
- DON'T SAY THAT
UNLESS YOU MEAN IT.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.341
- AND IF YOU NEED ANY HELP
CARRYING STUFF TO THE CAR,

04:00.374 --> 04:02.444
I'D BE GLAD TO BE
OF ASSISTANCE.

04:02.476 --> 04:06.906
- WOW, YOU'RE GOOD
FOR 1,001 USES.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.347
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER?

04:08.382 --> 04:09.952
- I DON'T KNOW.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.393
- I'M OUT.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.619
- AT WORK?

04:12.653 --> 04:14.023
THAT'S FABULOUS.

04:14.054 --> 04:17.764
- OUT OF THE SCENE, I MEAN.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.331
I MADE UP MY MIND--

04:19.360 --> 04:21.959
NO MORE BARS, NO MORE BATHS,
NO MORE CLUBS.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.955
YOU'LL NEVER SEE MY FACE
AT BABYLON AGAIN.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.497
- OH, PLEASE.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.073
YOU CAN'T LET
ONE LITTLE DRUG-INDUCED COMA

04:27.100 --> 04:28.400
GET YOU DOWN.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.636
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:29.670 --> 04:31.840
- YOU LOOK
UNBELIEVABLY TRASHY.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.442
- TALKED ME INTO IT.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.614
I'LL BUY IT.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.642
- YOU MISSED
MY POINT ENTIRELY.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.777
EVERYTHING WE DO,
EVEN THE CLOTHES WE WEAR,

04:38.812 --> 04:40.812
IS A CONSCIOUS,
OR WORSE YET,

04:40.848 --> 04:42.548
UNCONSCIOUS ATTEMPT
TO GET LAID.

04:42.583 --> 04:43.553
- YES, IT'S TRUE.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.524
THERE IS
AN OVEREMPHASIS ON SEX.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.993
BUT WHY NOT BUY TWO SIZES
TOO SMALL AND GO WITH IT?

04:48.021 --> 04:49.921
- BECAUSE, TRAGICALLY,

04:49.957 --> 04:51.927
SOME OF US WERE NOT BORN
TO WEAR LYCRA.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.989
- HERE,
CHECK OUT THE PERSONALS.

04:54.027 --> 04:57.367
PERHAPS YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE
TO NOT GO OUT WITH.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.568
- YOU KNOW, ONE THING I NEVER
UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THESE ADS--

04:59.600 --> 05:02.540
WHY IS IT ALWAYS "TIT WORK"
AND "ASS PLAY"?

05:02.570 --> 05:04.040
IF YOU ASK ME,
IT'S A LOT HARDER TO--

05:04.071 --> 05:06.811
HEY, LOOK AT THIS,
AT THE CENTER.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.340
"DATE BAIT--

05:08.376 --> 05:09.706
"MEET OTHER SINGLE GAY MEN

05:09.743 --> 05:11.753
"IN A CIVILIZED EVENING
OF CONVERSATION.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.679
NO PICKUPS,
NO FACE-TO-FACE REJECTION."

05:14.715 --> 05:16.675
THEY HAVE AN OVER-30 NIGHT.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.087
- WHERE,
AT THE MORGUE?

05:18.118 --> 05:20.018
- JUST FOR THAT,
YOU'RE GOING WITH ME.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.763
- I AM NOT OVER 30.

05:22.790 --> 05:26.690
- AND I AM NOT GOING ALONE.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.897
[telephone rings]

05:33.066 --> 05:35.696
- I DIDN'T REALIZE WE HAD
SCHEDULED A FOLLOW-UP VISIT.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.706
- WE DIDN'T. I TOLD THEM
IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.508
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
- I'M A JERK.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.411
CAN YOU ADJUST THAT?

05:42.443 --> 05:45.953
- PROVIDED IT'S NOT
A PERMANENT CONDITION.

05:45.979 --> 05:49.049
- SEE, THE THING IS,
I DON'T DATE VERY OFTEN.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.622
YOU KNOW,
REAL "EAT A MEAL, TALK,

05:51.652 --> 05:54.792
"STARE INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES"
KIND OF DATES.

05:54.822 --> 05:58.492
SO I-I KIND OF FREAKED.

05:58.526 --> 06:02.056
AND I'M SORRY
I WAS SUCH AN ASSHOLE.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.865
- YOU WEREN'T AN ASSHOLE.

06:04.898 --> 06:08.098
- BELIEVE ME,
I'VE SEEN ASSHOLES AND--

06:08.135 --> 06:11.035
I MEAN, UH...

06:11.071 --> 06:13.471
I FEEL SHITTY ABOUT IT.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.837
AND...

06:14.875 --> 06:16.605
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

06:16.644 --> 06:19.554
AND I THINK YOU MIGHT
ACTUALLY HAVE LIKED ME.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.910
- I DO LIKE YOU.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.418
- YOU DO?

06:22.450 --> 06:24.150
WELL...

06:24.184 --> 06:27.394
DO YOU THINK
WE COULD START OVER?

06:28.656 --> 06:31.526
- SIT DOWN.

06:44.605 --> 06:48.735
YOU'RE ADORABLE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

06:48.776 --> 06:51.706
[knocking on door]

06:54.815 --> 06:56.145
- I GOT SOMETHING FOR GUS.

06:56.183 --> 06:59.093
- [chuckles]

06:59.119 --> 07:01.459
THAT'S SO SWEET.

07:01.489 --> 07:04.989
WE'LL CALL MICHAEL LATER
TO THANK HIM.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.655
[Gus fussing]

07:06.694 --> 07:07.904
- HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN DRAWING?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.998
- MY MOM BROUGHT ME CRAYONS
WHEN I WAS STILL IN THE CRIB.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.870
- HMM.
- I NEVER STOPPED.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.129
- WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

07:13.166 --> 07:16.166
- WE RAN INTO EACH OTHER
ON THE STREET.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.713
- IT WAS, LIKE,
THIS WEIRD COINCIDENCE.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.139
- I BET.

07:21.174 --> 07:25.014
- YOU KNOW, THESE ARE GOOD.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.505
- THAT'S WHAT MY MOM SAYS.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.147
- LINDSAY'S AN ART TEACHER.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.121
- FOR SOMEONE YOUR AGE,

07:29.149 --> 07:31.589
YOU HAVE AN AMAZING FEEL
FOR THE HUMAN FORM.

07:31.619 --> 07:34.089
- I'VE NOTICED THAT MYSELF.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.821
- LOOK AT THIS.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.586
- OH, DON'T SHOW HIM.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.255
- OH.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.562
MMM.

07:41.595 --> 07:44.095
- WHEN DID YOU DRAW THAT?

07:44.131 --> 07:45.701
- WHEN YOU WERE ASLEEP.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.703
- AH, CIRCUMCISED...

07:47.735 --> 07:49.535
JUST LIKE I THOUGHT.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.870
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S GOING TO BE
AN ART SHOW AT THE GLC.

07:51.905 --> 07:52.905
- WHAT'S THAT?

07:52.940 --> 07:55.840
- THE GAY AND LESBIAN CENTER--

07:55.876 --> 07:58.976
SAFE HAVEN FOR FAGS
WHO CAN'T GET LAID.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.912
- YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT BE GOOD
TO GET OUT

08:00.948 --> 08:03.718
AND MEET SOME NICE YOUNG MEN
FOR A CHANGE.

08:03.751 --> 08:04.821
- IT'S THE ANNUAL FUND-RAISER.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.592
MELANIE AND I
ARE ON THE BOARD.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.620
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE
YOUR WORK IN THE SHOW?

08:08.656 --> 08:10.656
- YOU MEAN
PEOPLE SEEING MY STUFF?

08:10.691 --> 08:13.761
- YEAH.
- THAT'D BE INTENSE.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.234
BUT, YEAH.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.362
- GOOD.

08:16.396 --> 08:20.526
GIVE HIM SOME ACTIVITIES,
SO HE'LL STOP STALKING ME.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.868
- DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.643
[Gus babbles]
- [laughs]

08:24.672 --> 08:26.742
WE LIKE JUSTIN.

08:26.774 --> 08:28.284
JUSTIN CAN STAY.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.308
- WE'LL MAKE SURE
EVERYONE COMES,

08:30.343 --> 08:32.183
INCLUDING YOU.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.611
- [mouths word]

08:33.647 --> 08:34.847
- WRITE DOWN THE NUMBERS

08:34.881 --> 08:36.282
OF THE MEN
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.686
AND IF THE COMPUTER
MATCHES YOU UP,

08:38.719 --> 08:40.289
YOU HAVE TO GO OUT
ON A DATE.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.789
THOSE ARE THE RULES.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.762
- HI.
UH, MY NAME IS BRUCE.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.332
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.159
I ONLY CAME OUT
ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.995
- I LIKE, UH,
BEN & JERRY'S CHUBBY HUBBY...

08:51.031 --> 08:54.101
- I TEACH PIANO AND VOICE
AT CARNEGIE MELLON.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.174
- AND WATCHING FRASIER.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.013
- MY FRIEND MADE ME COME.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.908
- I'M LOOKING FOR A NICE GUY
WHO LIKES CHIHUAHUAS.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.142
I HAVE THREE.

09:03.176 --> 09:06.776
- MY BOYFRIEND WOULD KILL ME
IF HE KNEW.

09:06.814 --> 09:09.654
- AND I HAVE
A SPEEDO FETISH...

09:09.683 --> 09:11.653
ESPECIALLY RED AND TEAL.

09:11.685 --> 09:15.785
- I RECENTLY WENT HOME
WITH THIS VERY CUTE BOY

09:15.823 --> 09:17.363
THAT I MET AT BABYLON.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.090
UH, HE HAD SOME DRUGS.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.596
- I ALSO CONDUCT
THE LOCAL GAY MEN'S CHORUS.

09:21.629 --> 09:24.199
I HOPE YOU'LL ALL COME
TO OUR UPCOMING CONCERT.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.801
- I WANTED TO SEEM YOUNG
AND SEXY, SO I TOOK SOME,

09:27.835 --> 09:30.095
AND I ENDED UP IN A COMA.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.297
[clears throat]
AND, UH...

09:31.338 --> 09:36.008
- AND I WOULD LOVE SOMEONE
TO COME HOME TO AFTER REHEARSAL.

09:36.043 --> 09:39.353
- NOW I'M LOOKING
FOR A RELATIONSHIP

09:39.379 --> 09:41.379
BASED ON SOMETHING REAL.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.124
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE
THERE MIGHT BE SOMEONE HERE

09:43.150 --> 09:44.720
WHO'S LOOKING
FOR THE SAME THING.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.292
AND, UH, THAT'S ALL.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.834
- FAGGOTS, FAGGOTS EVERYWHERE
AND NOT A DROP TO DRINK.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.761
I CAN HONESTLY SAY I HAVE
NO DESIRE TO HAVE SEX

09:55.796 --> 09:58.096
WITH ANY OF THESE PEOPLE.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.371
- ME NEITHER.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.140
[exhales deeply]

10:02.169 --> 10:05.169
IT'S A START.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.414
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
SO MANY COMIC BOOKS.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.246
- THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY
I BRING HOME S--

10:15.282 --> 10:17.992
I MEAN,
PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME THAT.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.388
- MM-HMM.
- [clears throat]

10:20.420 --> 10:23.120
- WHO'S THE BIG FELLA?

10:23.156 --> 10:25.886
- CAPTAIN ASTRO.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.326
UM, MY FRIEND EMMETT--
HE'S STAYING WITH ME.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.801
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A TEMPORARY THING,

10:29.830 --> 10:31.260
BUT HE'S BECOME
SORT OF A SQUATTER.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.738
HE MAY COME HOME AT ANY TIME.
SO, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

10:34.768 --> 10:38.838
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
FOR EVERYTHING.

10:38.872 --> 10:39.842
- I KNOW.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.283
I DO THAT.
I'M SORRY.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.409
UM...

10:44.444 --> 10:45.914
DO YOU WANT ANYTHING--

10:45.946 --> 10:49.276
UM, JUICE, BEER?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.216
I DON'T HAVE ANY WINE.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.944
- SLOW.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.833
- HI, GUYS.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'D LIKE?

12:05.859 --> 12:06.989
- UM...

12:07.027 --> 12:10.827
I'LL HAVE
THE BACON CHEESEBURGER,

12:10.864 --> 12:11.834
MEDIUM FRIES,

12:11.865 --> 12:14.895
AND, UH, A PEPSI.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.965
- OKAY.

12:17.004 --> 12:20.444
- UH, I'LL HAVE THE, UH--
THE GRILLED TUNA

12:20.473 --> 12:24.043
AND UM--I, UH--

12:24.077 --> 12:27.147
JUST--I'LL HA--I'LL HAVE WATER.
- OH, COME ON, LIVE A LITTLE.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.980
I CAN TELL YOU'VE BEEN
DENYING YOURSELF

12:29.016 --> 12:31.276
FOR WAY TOO LONG.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.986
- ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME
WHAT HE'S HAVING.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.992
- OKAY, COMING RIGHT UP.

12:37.024 --> 12:40.994
[indistinct background chatter]

12:43.130 --> 12:45.500
- HE HAS A NICE SMILE.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.302
- AMONG OTHER ATTRIBUTES.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.104
- I'M SURE
HE'S A FINE PERSON.

12:49.136 --> 12:52.506
- RHODES SCHOLAR
WOULD BE MY GUESS.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.539
- YOU KNOW, ORDINARILY,
I'D BE WRACKING MY BRAIN

12:54.574 --> 12:56.044
TO COME UP
WITH SOME PATHETIC LINE

12:56.076 --> 12:57.336
FOR WHEN HE COMES BACK,
LIKE, UH,

12:57.377 --> 12:59.047
"I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU HERE BEFORE.
ARE YOU NEW?"

12:59.079 --> 13:01.279
- OR, UH, "DO I KNOW YOU
FROM SOMEWHERE?

13:01.314 --> 13:03.154
NO?
MUST BE IN A DREAM."

13:03.183 --> 13:06.093
- "SO WHEN DID THEY START HIRING
MODELS HERE?"

13:06.119 --> 13:08.159
[both laugh]
- YOU'RE WORSE THAN I AM.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.988
YOU WANT ME TO GO
TO THE MEN'S ROOM,

13:10.023 --> 13:11.523
SO YOU CAN TAKE
A CRACK AT HIM OR...?

13:11.558 --> 13:13.458
- OH, GOD, NO!
[groans]

13:13.493 --> 13:15.303
IT NEVER WORKED ANYWAY--

13:15.328 --> 13:16.598
ALL THAT USELESS FLIRTING.

13:16.629 --> 13:20.169
- IT IS SUCH A RELIEF
TO BE OUT OF THAT WORLD.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.440
- I HAVE
A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.069
I DIDN'T GO TO DATE BAIT
JUST TO DRUM UP AN AUDIENCE

13:25.105 --> 13:27.205
FOR OUR 500TH SONDHEIM CONCERT.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.140
- I HAD A FEELING.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.875
- I WAS HOPING
THAT I WOULD FIND SOMEONE

13:30.911 --> 13:31.881
I COULD CONNECT TO.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.312
- SOMEONE APPROPRIATE.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.476
- EXACTLY.

13:34.514 --> 13:37.284
SOMEONE APPROPRIATE.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.447
- WELL...

13:39.486 --> 13:44.056
I SAY LET'S GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER AND...

13:44.091 --> 13:46.061
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.063
- TAKE IT SLOW.

13:47.094 --> 13:50.064
I ALWAYS PREFERRED
ANDANTE TO PRESTO ANYWAY.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.127
[chuckles]

13:51.164 --> 13:52.974
- OKAY, BOYS...

13:53.000 --> 13:56.040
THESE'LL HELP COOL YOU DOWN.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.876
- 27 MINUTES ON MY NIPPLES--

14:01.909 --> 14:03.079
I CLOCKED IT.

14:03.110 --> 14:06.310
I MEAN, I EXPECTED HIM TO KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH HIS HANDS,

14:06.346 --> 14:07.546
'CAUSE THAT'S HIS BUSINESS,

14:07.580 --> 14:11.250
BUT HE HAS
THE MOST TALENTED TONGUE.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.494
EVERY TIME I CAME--

14:12.519 --> 14:14.349
all:
"EVERY TIME"?

14:14.387 --> 14:18.227
- HE WOULD JUST
KEEP ON GOING...

14:18.258 --> 14:21.028
LICKING ME EVERYWHERE.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.901
- I ONCE KNEW A GUY
WHO COULD TIE A CHERRY STEM

14:22.930 --> 14:24.260
INTO A KNOT
WITH HIS TONGUE.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.167
I WAS AFRAID TO LET HIM
BLOW ME.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.299
- 27 MINUTES?

14:27.334 --> 14:30.904
WAS THAT 13 1/2
ON EACH NIPPLE, OR--

14:30.938 --> 14:34.168
- 16 RIGHT, 11 LEFT.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.977
- YEAH, THAT'S PROBABLY HOW LONG
IT TAKES HIM TO GET IT UP.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.150
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.978
I NEVER SAW IT
WHEN IT WAS DOWN.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.653
- ANOTHER VIAGRA SUCCESS STORY.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.522
- SO ARE YOU BRINGING HIM
TO WOODY'S TONIGHT?

14:44.551 --> 14:46.521
- HE'S NOT REALLY
INTO THE BAR SCENE.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.653
[weights clanging]

14:47.687 --> 14:49.417
- WELL, WHAT IS HE INTO?

14:49.456 --> 14:51.156
- HIS LIFE.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.531
- LIKE THE GUY I MET.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.659
- YOU MET SOMEONE?

14:54.694 --> 14:56.534
- HE'S VERY NICE,

14:56.563 --> 14:58.703
VERY INTELLIGENT,
VERY INTERESTING.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.031
- IS HE A TOP OR A BOTTOM?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.238
- YOU KNOW,
NOT EVERYBODY JUDGES PEOPLE

15:03.270 --> 15:04.270
BY YOUR CRITERIA, OKAY?

15:04.304 --> 15:05.974
ROGER AND I--
- [laughs]

15:06.006 --> 15:06.966
ROGER?

15:07.007 --> 15:08.637
- ROGER AND I HAVE DECIDED

15:08.675 --> 15:11.235
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER
BEFORE WE HAVE SEX.

15:11.278 --> 15:14.648
- WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE--
LESBIANS?

15:14.681 --> 15:16.621
- IT'S LIKE
THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.489
- NO. NO, IT IS,
BECAUSE BARBRA

15:18.518 --> 15:20.548
PLAYS AN UNATTRACTIVE
PROFESSOR--NO OFFENSE--

15:20.587 --> 15:21.517
WHO MARRIES JEFF BRIDGES

15:21.554 --> 15:23.094
BECAUSE NEITHER ONE OF THEM
CAN HANDLE SEX.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.163
BUT OF COURSE
BARBRA GETS HORNY BECAUSE,

15:25.192 --> 15:27.292
HELLO, JEFF'S
SUCH A DREAMBOAT.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.097
SO SHE HOPS ON A STAIRMASTER
FOR, LIKE, TWO MINUTES,

15:29.129 --> 15:30.159
EATS A CARROT STICK,
AND THEN, POOF!

15:30.197 --> 15:31.327
SHE'S GORGEOUS.

15:31.364 --> 15:34.274
THEN SHE COMES IN DRESSED
LIKE THE HOOKER IN NUTS,

15:34.301 --> 15:36.171
AND, OF COURSE,
JEFF'S WILLING TO FUCK HER.

15:36.203 --> 15:40.373
AND, UM,
THEY DANCE IN THE STREET.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.177
- AND SHE STILL
WASN'T NOMINATED.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.309
- YOU KNOW,
YOU DO IT RIGHT AWAY,

15:44.344 --> 15:47.184
OR YOU DON'T DO IT AT ALL.

15:47.214 --> 15:51.584
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU, MIKEY.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.318
- THE FUCK HE IS.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.462
- JUSTIN, DAPHNE'S HERE.

15:58.491 --> 16:01.331
MOLLY...
- WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.531
HEY, LOOK...

16:03.563 --> 16:06.403
JUSTIN TOLD ME HOW GREAT
YOU'RE BEING ABOUT EVERYTHING.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.343
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY
I THINK HE'S REALLY LUCKY

16:08.368 --> 16:09.998
TO HAVE SUCH
AN UNDERSTANDING MOM.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.637
- WELL, I'M TRYING.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.211
- YEAH, WELL,
IT MUST BE HARD,

16:13.240 --> 16:15.180
'CAUSE MY FAMILY--
I'M BLACK,

16:15.208 --> 16:16.278
MY PARENTS ARE BLACK.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.549
WE'RE ALL BLACK,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

16:18.578 --> 16:20.748
- I THINK SO.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.180
- OH.
DID YOU SEE THE FLYER?

16:23.216 --> 16:25.446
- WHAT FLYER?
- FOR THE ART SHOW.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.085
HIS NAME'S REALLY BIG.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.120
WOULD YOU COME ON ALREADY?

16:29.156 --> 16:32.056
- GAY AND LESBIAN CENT--
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

16:32.092 --> 16:33.792
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU MEAN HE DIDN'T--

16:33.826 --> 16:35.796
- HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH
THESE DAYS.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.398
- OH, PROMISE
YOU WON'T TELL HIM I TOLD YOU,

16:38.431 --> 16:39.571
OR HE'LL STOP TELLING ME.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.229
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.638
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.770
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHEN I'LL BE BACK.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.235
- JUSTIN!

16:47.274 --> 16:49.144
[door opens, closes]

16:49.176 --> 16:50.806
BE CAREFUL.

16:50.843 --> 16:54.613
- CHRIS, PASS ME THAT HAMMER.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.117
- YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT THAT.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.549
- THANKS.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.194
I LIKE YOU GUYS' BRACELETS.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.389
- OH, THEY'RE FOR FRIENDSHIP.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.260
I MEAN, HE'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND
OR ANYTHING.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.789
- I FIGURED.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.532
- YOU CAN TELL I'M GAY?

17:05.558 --> 17:08.428
- WELL, YOU'RE HERE,
AREN'T YOU?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.800
I'M HEADING ON DOWN TO THE DINER
TO GET A SODA.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.630
YOU WANT TO COME?

17:12.665 --> 17:15.065
- SURE.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.442
- WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:17.470 --> 17:18.740
SHE THINKS YOU'RE A LESBIAN.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.570
- WELL, CAN'T I BE ONE
OF THE COOL PEOPLE TOO?

17:21.608 --> 17:22.738
- YOU'RE A FREAK.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.335
[chuckles]

17:26.346 --> 17:28.646
- YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE REAL TALENT.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.681
- REALLY?
- YOU SHOULD DEVELOP IT--

17:30.717 --> 17:31.817
MAYBE GO TO ART SCHOOL.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.321
- I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.723
- WELL, IF YOU EVER NEED
A RECOMMENDATION...

17:34.754 --> 17:37.164
- THANKS.

17:37.190 --> 17:40.860
- DO YOU THINK
BRIAN'S GOING TO COME?

17:40.893 --> 17:43.563
- DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH
FROM HIM, OKAY?

17:43.596 --> 17:46.326
- WHAT'S TOO MUCH?

17:46.366 --> 17:47.866
- ANYTHING AT ALL.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.640
YOU'LL HAVE LOTS
OF RELATIONSHIPS, JUSTIN,

17:49.669 --> 17:51.799
WITH LOTS
OF INTERESTING PEOPLE.

17:51.838 --> 17:55.708
I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT
RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU WILL.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.812
- I JUST WANT HIM
TO SEE HIS PICTURE FRAMED,

17:57.844 --> 18:01.314
THAT'S ALL.

18:01.348 --> 18:04.178
[overlapping chatter,
pulsing club music]

18:12.292 --> 18:13.632
- ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO DO THIS?

18:13.660 --> 18:15.260
- YEAH, WHY NOT?

18:15.295 --> 18:18.525
GET A TASTE OF YOUR WORLD,
SEE WHAT I'M SAVING YOU FROM.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.897
- * THIS IS WHAT I FEEL

18:22.935 --> 18:26.565
* DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU CAN TAKE *

18:26.606 --> 18:27.606
* EVERYTHING...

18:27.640 --> 18:30.380
- JUST THE SAME
AS I REMEMBER IT.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.150
EVEN THE GUYS LOOK THE SAME.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.610
- WHY'D YOU STOP?

18:34.647 --> 18:37.877
- IT WASN'T FOR ME.
AND I MET SOMEONE.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.317
- OH.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.822
- YEAH, WE WERE TOGETHER
ALMOST SIX YEARS.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.694
- WOW.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.893
SO WHO LEFT WHO?

18:46.926 --> 18:49.796
- HE DIED.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.259
- I'M SORRY.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.368
- NOBODY'S FAULT.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.500
- HI.
[giggles]

18:55.535 --> 18:58.535
SO IS, UH--IS THIS
THE FAMOUS CHIROPRACTOR?

18:58.571 --> 19:00.641
- DAVID, THIS IS EMMETT.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.413
- HI, EMMETT.
- HELLO, GORGEOUS.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.483
SO, UM--
SO I'VE, UH--

19:06.513 --> 19:07.783
I'VE GOT A LITTLE TIGHTNESS
RIGHT IN HERE--

19:07.814 --> 19:08.784
ONE PLACE I DON'T NEED IT.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.875
[chuckles]
WOULD YOU MIND?

19:09.916 --> 19:12.286
- I WOULDN'T MIND AT ALL
IF YOU MADE AN APPOINTMENT.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.719
- WELL, IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.224
- WHERE'S TED?

19:16.256 --> 19:18.626
- OUT WITH
THE PILLSBURY DOUGHBOY.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.928
OH, MY GOD.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.489
THAT GUY OVER THERE LOOKS
EXACTLY

19:21.528 --> 19:23.528
LIKE MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY.

19:23.563 --> 19:27.533
MAYBE HE SMOKES POT NAKED.
EXCUSE ME.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.637
- [laughs]

19:28.668 --> 19:30.398
HE DOESN'T HOLD
ANYTHING BACK, HUH?

19:30.437 --> 19:34.867
- HE WAS TONING IT DOWN
FOR YOU.

19:38.445 --> 19:41.405

19:46.853 --> 19:48.593
- AND I'VE HEARD
A LOT ABOUT YOU TOO.

19:48.621 --> 19:52.761

MOST OF THE LETTERS
ON SESAME STREET.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.470

TAKING ALL THAT SHIT.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.872
I'M GOING TO GET YOU
SOME WATER.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.413

- SURE.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.712
WELL, YOU'VE GOT HIM
WELL TRAINED.

20:11.744 --> 20:15.724

TO MICHAEL,

I RELEASED HIM FROM MY CARE
BEFORE WE WENT OUT TOGETHER.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.733
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT DO YOU DO?

20:32.765 --> 20:34.395

20:34.434 --> 20:36.544
- WELL, YOU MUST KNOW
A THING OR TWO

20:36.569 --> 20:38.639
ABOUT SCREWING PEOPLE
YOURSELF.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.611
- YEAH, I COULD DO IT
IN MY SLEEP.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.680
- I BET YOU COULD.

WITH YOU.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.075

- WHO'S TRYING?

21:40.700 --> 21:42.000
- YOU ARE THE FIRST PERSON

21:42.034 --> 21:44.544
I'VE MET IN PITTSBURGH
WHO KNOWS SESTO'S ARIA.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.811

WHO KNOWS.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.579

21:49.609 --> 21:52.909
I USED TO PRETEND I WAS SICK
ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS

YOU'D BE THERE.

JUST BECAUSE I FUCK GUYS

DOES NOT MEAN I'M PART
OF SOME COMMUNITY.

I HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON

AND YOU DID.

- I WAS TESTING HIM.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.313
I WANTED TO SEE IF HE'D DROP YOU
THE FIRST CHANCE HE GOT.

27:59.345 --> 28:02.205

BECAUSE SOMEBODY FINALLY THINKS

I'M HOT OR SOMETHING.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.790
- YOU ARE HOT OR SOMETHING.

THAT, UM...

- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.792
- WELL, YOU KNOW THAT--

28:44.824 --> 28:46.934
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER AS FRIENDS,
BUT THAT'S IT.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.389
THAT'S REALLY--
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.497
- REALLY?

28:49.528 --> 28:51.858
IT'S NOT LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW.

- DO YOU WANT A SHRIMP BALL?

28:54.466 --> 28:56.496
- NO.

THANKS.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.394
- [snickers]

29:19.425 --> 29:21.525
I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED
CREATIVE PEOPLE.

29:21.560 --> 29:25.000
- YOU'RE PRETTY CREATIVE
YOURSELF THERE, MISSY.

29:25.031 --> 29:28.271
- [scoffs]
NOT ME.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.300
BUT MICHAEL--
HE'S GOT A GIFT.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.067
- I DIDN'T KNOW
HE COULD DRAW.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.835
- OH, HE CAN'T.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.984
I BOUGHT HIM TRACING PAPER
WHEN HE WAS A KID

29:37.009 --> 29:38.409
SO HE COULD COPY
HIS COMIC BOOKS.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.884
HIS SPIDER-MAN ALWAYS ENDED UP

29:43.082 --> 29:45.482
- WELL, WHAT'S HIS TALENT?

29:45.517 --> 29:48.887
- WELL, IT'S NOTHING
HE'D BE FAMOUS FOR.

29:48.921 --> 29:51.421
YOU WON'T EVER SEE
HIS PAINTINGS

29:51.457 --> 29:52.857
HANGING IN AN ART GALLERY

29:52.892 --> 29:57.432
OR HEAR HIM PLAYING
AT CARNEGIE HALL.

29:57.463 --> 30:00.373
BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE,

30:00.399 --> 30:04.299
KNOWING WHAT YOU NEED
BETTER EVEN THAN YOU DO,

30:04.336 --> 30:07.336
HE'S A FUCKING PICASSO.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.936
- BEAUTIFUL LIGHT AND SHADOW.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.884
- VERY...
