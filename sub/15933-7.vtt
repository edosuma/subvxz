WEBVTT

00:23.400 --> 00:24.984
Good morning.

00:25.652 --> 00:26.861
Good morning, Mom.

00:28.780 --> 00:31.157
- Your cat bit me again.
- You stole my pencils.

00:31.241 --> 00:33.785
- Why are you fighting?
- Because he stole my pencils!

00:33.868 --> 00:35.348
- She's making it up.
- Stop fighting.

00:35.412 --> 00:39.165
- Let's see.
- Let's go, sweetie. What time is it?

00:39.249 --> 00:42.043
- 6:40 a.m.
- God, I'm late again.

00:42.127 --> 00:44.713
Remember to ask your brother
what we talked about.

00:45.463 --> 00:49.134
- Tell him school starts next week.
- Yes. I'll ask him, all right?

00:49.217 --> 00:52.095
I still have to buy the books, everything.

00:52.178 --> 00:54.514
I told you I'll ask him, my love,
all right?

00:54.597 --> 00:59.352
And you still haven't tied your shoes.
So, like I taught you, right?

00:59.436 --> 01:02.856
We have the rabbit ear,
we go around the tree, and...?

01:02.939 --> 01:04.274
And it goes in the hole.

01:10.155 --> 01:11.489
That was a loud one.

01:56.701 --> 02:00.021
LLUIS LODOÑO WHITE, SERVILE FRONT MAN AND
INITIATOR OF KIDNAPPINGS FOR PABLO ESCOBAR

02:06.920 --> 02:07.920
Sit him there.

02:09.881 --> 02:11.132
Over here.

02:23.770 --> 02:25.438
Look at that ugly son of a bitch.

02:31.820 --> 02:34.864
One... two... and three.

04:10.877 --> 04:13.755
This family is the only thing
I care about.

04:13.838 --> 04:17.216
- You're the one that--
- Me? Me, ma'am? Me?

04:17.300 --> 04:20.511
- We shouldn't leave, Tata.
- All of this is your fault.

04:20.970 --> 04:23.848
If you'd listened to Pablo,
my brother would still be alive.

04:25.266 --> 04:29.729
Because you do that so well?
Do you listen to him?

04:29.812 --> 04:35.777
When you're always criticizing him,
doubting him, worrying.

04:44.077 --> 04:48.373
I would never put this family in danger.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.042
Tell her, Pablo.

04:51.626 --> 04:54.253
Tell her it's not my fault, Pablo.

04:55.797 --> 04:58.841
- I know, Mom.
- This isn't my fault. Tell her, Pablo.

04:58.925 --> 05:03.471
It's not your fault. I know.
It's not your fault.

05:06.391 --> 05:08.434
Everything's all right, Mom.

05:09.769 --> 05:11.354
It wasn't your fault.

06:18.963 --> 06:21.674
Look at these smiling faces.

06:21.758 --> 06:24.010
We didn't want to make you
uncomfortable, Judy.

06:24.093 --> 06:29.098
How considerate of you.
So that's why no one called me?

06:30.475 --> 06:32.894
Because this lab belongs to the Moncadas.

06:33.978 --> 06:37.732
So I was supposed to be notified
when it was taken back.

06:37.815 --> 06:41.944
- That wasn't made clear to us.
- I'm making it clear now, Carlos.

06:43.321 --> 06:46.866
- What are we going to do with that?
- All the cocaine is going to Cali.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.118
That is my cocaine.

06:49.786 --> 06:54.707
Look, Judy, we decided that not a single
kilo of cocaine will be moved in Medellín

06:54.791 --> 06:57.585
until Pablo Escobar is dead.

06:57.668 --> 07:01.047
That's our strategy. To asphyxiate him.

07:01.130 --> 07:05.009
That's the Cali cartel's strategy?

07:05.093 --> 07:07.637
To keep making money
while the rest of us go hungry?

07:07.720 --> 07:12.475
- You know we can't trust them.
- No. Not them or any of you.

07:13.392 --> 07:17.355
We don't trust any drug trafficker.

07:20.024 --> 07:24.737
Well, let's not get personal, Carlos.
All right?

07:25.404 --> 07:27.156
We all need friends.

07:37.416 --> 07:38.876
Sir, would you like some?

07:57.895 --> 07:59.480
Go!

08:06.779 --> 08:07.947
Sir?

08:12.451 --> 08:13.744
Are you all right?

08:43.191 --> 08:44.859
Are you all right?

09:12.053 --> 09:15.306
- We're done working together.
- What's bothering you?

09:15.389 --> 09:19.227
The killing of innocent civilians,
for starters.

09:19.936 --> 09:23.356
Whether they're innocent or guilty,
I don't decide.

09:23.439 --> 09:25.191
That's what priests are for, no?

09:32.531 --> 09:36.160
The Castaños are crazier than ever,
and that wasn't part of the plan.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.247
But it's working.

09:40.206 --> 09:42.625
Not if I stop providing you intel.

09:44.043 --> 09:48.381
For what it's worth, I am on your side.

09:48.464 --> 09:50.341
I don't like what's happening.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.885
Medellín is my home
and I love it very much.

09:54.887 --> 09:57.098
As far as the methods
of the Castaños go...

09:58.099 --> 10:03.771
well, those are the methods
that have Pablo's people hiding like rats.

10:03.854 --> 10:07.566
Including that gonorrhea of a lawyer,
Fernando Duque.

10:07.650 --> 10:12.196
Our guys fired a whole fucking clip
at him, point blank.

10:12.280 --> 10:16.492
Can you believe that these sons of bitches
didn't hit him once?

10:17.118 --> 10:19.120
I need you to help me find him.

10:21.706 --> 10:24.667
He's Pablo's mouthpiece
and his connection to the government.

10:24.750 --> 10:28.671
What we want is to exterminate this rat.

10:28.754 --> 10:34.510
That way, we'll get to Pablo
and we can end this madness, Peña.

10:48.566 --> 10:51.402
I've told you! You have to--

10:51.485 --> 10:55.823
What are you doing?
You have to bring the passports.

10:55.906 --> 10:59.994
Juliana... they're trying to kill me.
We have to get out of here.

11:00.077 --> 11:03.039
I think you're the one
who needs to leave.

11:04.165 --> 11:06.876
Can I see Simon, at least?

11:06.959 --> 11:09.712
- Where-- Simon!
- Stop, Fernando!

11:09.795 --> 11:11.714
Simon is at school.

11:12.840 --> 11:18.220
Besides, this isn't even your week.
So, please... leave.

11:54.340 --> 11:56.842
- Oh, what's going on?
- How are you?

11:56.926 --> 11:58.386
- Bye, Anda!
- Bye!

11:58.469 --> 12:01.347
Where's Mom? Why do you have her car?

12:02.139 --> 12:03.307
Get in.

12:23.077 --> 12:24.077
Come in.

12:27.957 --> 12:29.750
Go on, son. Sit down.

12:31.627 --> 12:34.296
So, you're being reassigned...

12:35.339 --> 12:39.218
and you will be moved into the intel unit
that was formed a couple of months ago.

12:42.221 --> 12:43.848
You'll be all right there.

12:45.891 --> 12:48.269
You're sending me to an office
because I made a mistake?

12:51.522 --> 12:52.606
Anything else?

13:00.573 --> 13:02.074
Yes, sir, Colonel.

13:22.470 --> 13:24.138
How are you, Papa?

13:28.851 --> 13:30.311
And you?

13:30.394 --> 13:34.440
- How long will we be there?
- Not long.

13:35.941 --> 13:39.695
Just long enough for me
to get some things figured out here.

13:44.742 --> 13:47.536
Do you remember when
we went to the United States?

13:49.413 --> 13:51.916
It's going to be an adventure,
just like that.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.626
Do they have Disney World there?

13:57.463 --> 13:59.215
I don't think so.

14:14.939 --> 14:19.193
Listen to your mother
and your grandmother. All right?

14:22.238 --> 14:25.783
I made more than one reservation so
no one would know what flight you're on.

14:26.659 --> 14:29.620
I spoke to Fernando
and he said it's perfectly legal.

14:29.703 --> 14:33.666
You have every right to leave the country.

14:33.749 --> 14:37.253
- It's like a normal trip.
- A normal trip?

14:44.843 --> 14:48.973
Confess. Do you regret it?

14:49.056 --> 14:51.350
Marrying me, or what?

14:52.643 --> 14:53.686
Not for a second.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.950
They may separate us...

15:10.160 --> 15:13.497
but they'll never be able to destroy us.

15:22.590 --> 15:23.882
Go.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.896
The little bunny.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.149
I'll take care of him, all right?

15:40.983 --> 15:42.443
Give me a kiss.

20:23.348 --> 20:26.184
Sergeant. Private Hugo Martinez Jr.
at your service, sir.

20:33.483 --> 20:34.818
The colonel's son.

20:37.863 --> 20:39.948
He said you have some
technical background.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.536
I took a couple
of engineering classes, sir.

20:45.078 --> 20:48.206
And I built a ham in my parents' house.

20:49.249 --> 20:53.337
Great. What do you know about RDF?

20:56.882 --> 20:58.300
The basic concept, sir.

20:59.718 --> 21:01.136
The basic concept.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.099
All right.

21:07.559 --> 21:10.979
Get acquainted.
We go out tomorrow afternoon.

21:11.063 --> 21:12.606
And don't worry.

21:12.689 --> 21:16.735
Unlike Carlos Castaño,
this won't hit back.

21:32.084 --> 21:34.878
What's going on?
I'm going to freeze to death out here.

21:34.962 --> 21:36.421
That's Bogotá.
What do you expect?

21:36.505 --> 21:40.842
Hey! What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why are you not working?

21:40.926 --> 21:43.178
Get to work.
I'm not paying you with candy.

21:43.261 --> 21:45.931
- Okay, okay.
- Pass me the phone, boy.

21:46.014 --> 21:49.643
Make some fucking bombs.
You need an invitation to start working?

21:51.061 --> 21:54.606
Hurry, boy! You get to work too!

21:54.690 --> 21:56.608
And don't smoke near the gunpowder.

22:02.823 --> 22:06.076
Hey, boss.
I just came back from the airport.

22:06.159 --> 22:09.955
<i>Ms. Tata, the kids and your mother
are on the plane, boss.</i>

22:10.038 --> 22:11.623
Thank the Virgin Mary.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.712
That's the most important thing.
They're flying now.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.296
<i>One more thing.</i>

22:18.380 --> 22:21.299
We hit those fucking drugstores
pretty hard.

22:21.383 --> 22:24.011
You tell us. Should we come home or--

22:24.094 --> 22:27.973
<i>No. Stay put. We're not done yet.</i>

22:28.056 --> 22:29.766
<i>I may need you again.</i>

22:30.517 --> 22:32.227
<i>Copy that, boss.</i>

22:32.310 --> 22:33.562
Thank you, Blackie.

22:46.867 --> 22:51.204
Figure out... what time it is in Germany.

22:52.748 --> 22:54.207
On it, boss.

23:05.761 --> 23:07.220
Boss!

23:11.975 --> 23:13.185
Boss!

24:24.673 --> 24:25.674
<i>Peña.</i>

24:26.299 --> 24:28.718
Any word on our friend?

24:28.802 --> 24:30.387
<i>Did you find him?</i>

24:33.598 --> 24:36.393
<i>- Peña?</i>
- Not yet.

25:34.743 --> 25:35.994
What's up, Peña?

25:37.370 --> 25:39.039
Are we getting a beer or what?

25:41.291 --> 25:42.792
Another day, brother.

25:44.377 --> 25:45.754
See you tomorrow.

26:00.060 --> 26:01.561
No. What are you doing, Simon?

26:01.645 --> 26:05.065
Leave it where it is.
I'm listening to the news.

26:06.274 --> 26:08.401
What are we doing here?

26:08.485 --> 26:10.946
I told you. We're going on a trip.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.490
And what's happening? Where's my mom?

26:14.741 --> 26:17.994
Simon... calm down.
I already spoke to your mother.

26:18.078 --> 26:20.413
You got yourself into trouble, didn't you?

26:22.249 --> 26:24.000
It's because you work for Pablo Escobar.

26:26.503 --> 26:28.129
That's why this is happening.

26:33.051 --> 26:34.427
You're his lawyer.

26:37.305 --> 26:39.140
What are we going to do now?

26:41.142 --> 26:43.520
I have a plan. Calm down.

26:44.396 --> 26:48.733
You don't have a plan, Dad.
You're a son of a bitch. A fucking thief.

26:49.776 --> 26:53.154
Did you say "son of a bitch"? "Thief"?

26:54.197 --> 26:57.993
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer.

26:59.369 --> 27:03.373
All of the money this family has,
we have because I've been a good lawyer.

27:03.456 --> 27:06.543
- I do my job.
- I want to call my mom.

27:06.626 --> 27:08.712
You want to call your mom?

27:08.795 --> 27:12.215
Do you want to call your mom,
or do you want to behave like a man?

27:12.299 --> 27:16.052
Are you going to be a pussy
and call your mom? That's a great idea.

27:16.136 --> 27:19.639
Let's call her so she can tell you where
all the money for your toys came from.

27:19.723 --> 27:23.435
Your room full of toys.
Where do you think it came from?

27:25.186 --> 27:27.647
You didn't complain during the Christmases
or the birthdays

27:27.731 --> 27:29.983
or when I bought you a motorcycle.

27:30.066 --> 27:33.653
But now you're complaining. Very well!
Very well. It's over.

27:34.779 --> 27:38.491
It's over! Now that they're
going to kill me, it's over.

27:49.794 --> 27:52.255
I'm sorry... Simon.

27:54.299 --> 27:56.259
I didn't mean to say that.

27:56.343 --> 27:57.552
Forgive me.

27:58.845 --> 28:01.806
Everything will be all right.
Forgive me.

28:18.198 --> 28:20.241
Was it a heart attack or what?

28:20.325 --> 28:21.701
You fainted, Pablo.

28:25.580 --> 28:27.749
How many of those are you taking?

28:29.793 --> 28:32.545
I've had a terrible headache.

28:32.629 --> 28:35.298
Those aren't any good, Pablo.

28:35.382 --> 28:38.051
You shouldn't put so much shit
in your body.

28:40.387 --> 28:45.600
You're better off... taking these drops.
They're homeopathic.

28:45.683 --> 28:48.978
Three drops under your tongue
in the morning and two at night.

28:58.655 --> 29:00.698
Have you ever been to Disney World?

29:01.950 --> 29:03.243
I haven't.

29:05.453 --> 29:07.163
It's beautiful.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.210
It's very organized. Very clean.

29:16.339 --> 29:18.341
What's wrong with me, Ricardo?

29:19.551 --> 29:20.885
Stress.

29:22.971 --> 29:24.514
Stress is dangerous.

29:25.181 --> 29:27.100
How's the weed working out?

29:28.476 --> 29:31.062
I haven't been smoking a lot.

29:32.647 --> 29:37.652
The first man who smoked marijuana
was a Chinese emperor.

29:37.735 --> 29:41.865
He burned the plant because
he was attracted to its smell.

29:41.948 --> 29:45.535
But when he inhaled the smoke,
he saw a blue jay.

29:47.662 --> 29:52.417
And the bird told him
to conquer his neighboring empires.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.085
And that's what he did.

29:58.506 --> 29:59.549
All right.

30:01.509 --> 30:03.845
With you until death, Don Pablo.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.306
Thank you.

30:08.266 --> 30:11.603
I'd like to stay and stand guard.

30:16.107 --> 30:18.985
All right. Thank you.

30:34.125 --> 30:37.879
Let's see, darling.
Color inside the lines.

30:39.464 --> 30:40.882
There it is.

31:21.381 --> 31:23.633
This is our stop.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.464
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

32:45.923 --> 32:48.217
- What's going on?
- Can you give me back my passport?

32:54.849 --> 32:56.392
That money is ours.

33:01.939 --> 33:05.526
<i>- Pablo, they're not letting us in.</i>
- No, no! They can't do that.

33:05.610 --> 33:06.778
<i>That's what they're doing.</i>

33:06.861 --> 33:08.279
They can't--

33:08.363 --> 33:12.533
Listen, Tata, that's illegal.
That's illegal. Don't worry.

33:12.617 --> 33:13.868
<i>Don't worry, because--</i>

33:13.951 --> 33:17.955
Do what you need to do to get us
into Germany. I have to hang up.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.917
Don't touch me!
I'm asking you not to touch me.

33:21.918 --> 33:23.002
Let go!

34:09.674 --> 34:11.300
No!

34:17.265 --> 34:18.850
Fernando Duque.

34:20.393 --> 34:21.393
Javier Peña.

34:23.646 --> 34:25.273
It took me one day to find you.

34:25.356 --> 34:29.110
If you don't want them to kill you,
you need to start doing things better.

34:32.447 --> 34:35.825
Please... get me out of here.

34:36.451 --> 34:39.829
Please get me out of Colombia. Do you know
who I work for? Who I worked for?

34:40.455 --> 34:42.582
Well, our help isn't free.

34:44.375 --> 34:47.336
We need full cooperation.

34:48.629 --> 34:49.881
Dad!

34:50.757 --> 34:53.259
Hey, Simon, it's all right.

34:53.342 --> 34:57.180
It's all right. Go back inside.
I'll come up soon.

35:00.266 --> 35:04.937
It's my son. He's... He's scared.

35:06.522 --> 35:08.858
First, we'll get you to Holguín.
You'll be safe--

35:08.941 --> 35:12.612
No! No, we're staying here.

35:12.695 --> 35:16.866
There are cops working
for Los Pepes everywhere.

35:18.451 --> 35:22.455
It would be better if you get us
to the United States at once.

35:24.499 --> 35:27.335
I'll cooperate with you.
Anything you want.

35:27.418 --> 35:30.046
I'll cooperate with you.
Please get us out of Colombia.

35:31.047 --> 35:32.423
Is that a deal?

35:38.387 --> 35:39.680
Do as I say.

35:40.389 --> 35:44.227
Start by hiding your fucking wife's car.

36:06.749 --> 36:09.293
Hello, German embassy.

36:09.377 --> 36:14.799
First of all, I'll kill every last German
son of a bitch that lives in Colombia.

36:14.882 --> 36:19.011
Then I will bomb Frankfurt, Munich...

36:22.181 --> 36:27.019
<i>I'm going to shove bombs up your asses,
you bastard motherfuckers.</i>

36:27.103 --> 36:31.899
Nazi, racist gonorrheas.
I'm going to kill all of you. You hear?

36:31.983 --> 36:33.860
I'm going to kill all of you!

37:02.013 --> 37:08.060
I once heard you say that I had the same
rights as any other Colombian citizen.

37:09.770 --> 37:12.773
I imagine that also applies to my family,
correct?

37:13.482 --> 37:17.236
<i>The government hasn't done anything
to stop Los Pepes,</i>

37:17.320 --> 37:21.991
those terrorists who have attacked
my family and murdered my associates.

37:22.074 --> 37:27.288
Is that how the Colombian government
ensures the rights of all its citizens?

37:27.371 --> 37:31.876
<i>The president is trying to prevent
my family from entering Germany</i>

37:31.959 --> 37:33.502
<i>and yet you do nothing about it.</i>

37:33.586 --> 37:38.966
That man wants to dangle my family before
Los Pepes and use my children as bait,

37:39.050 --> 37:42.762
and you, who call yourself a man
of principle, do nothing about it.

38:00.655 --> 38:02.406
There's a lot of interference.

38:03.115 --> 38:06.369
Yes. Medellín has too many electrical
wires, phone wires, antennae.

38:06.452 --> 38:09.455
- That must be why.
- What's your success rate?

38:10.790 --> 38:12.875
To be honest,
we haven't located a signal yet.

38:12.959 --> 38:14.710
Not one?

38:15.544 --> 38:16.796
Not one.

38:23.928 --> 38:26.013
Here's what we're going to do, Morales.

38:26.097 --> 38:31.769
Let's both start here: L9.329.

38:33.312 --> 38:34.522
There it is.

38:41.904 --> 38:48.577
I was talking to my police contact and
you won't guess who's hiding the lawyer.

38:49.870 --> 38:53.582
None other than that son of a bitch, Peña.
What do you think about that?

38:54.917 --> 38:56.836
Who's your contact?

38:56.919 --> 39:01.674
Who he is isn't important.
The important thing is that I trust him.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.885
And you know what
the worst part of this is?

39:04.969 --> 39:07.054
We can no longer trust Peña.

39:07.763 --> 39:10.016
Then we'll have to put a bullet in him.

39:11.726 --> 39:13.269
No.

39:14.145 --> 39:17.023
We can't kill DEA agents.

39:17.106 --> 39:19.066
Oh, no? Why not?

39:22.111 --> 39:24.739
If it were up to me,
I'd feed him to the crocodiles.

39:26.574 --> 39:28.701
Berna, look...

39:35.332 --> 39:40.546
Schedule a meeting with Peña,
just as you have been.

39:41.964 --> 39:43.382
We'll take care of the rest.

43:35.906 --> 43:38.492
COURTESY OF LOS PEPES

43:41.996 --> 43:45.499
Córdoba recovers,
we'll have a goalie in place.

43:45.582 --> 43:49.169
Leonel Álvarez can do his thing
and move the ball along.

43:54.883 --> 43:58.387
Did you follow me to the hotel?
You told Berna?

43:59.680 --> 44:00.889
Let go.

44:00.973 --> 44:02.766
Tell me, asshole.

44:03.475 --> 44:05.352
- Let go! It's all right.
- What's the problem?

44:05.436 --> 44:08.147
I'll catch up. Everything's fine.

44:09.773 --> 44:11.233
What's going on, Peña?

44:13.652 --> 44:15.321
Playing the fucking American?

44:17.114 --> 44:18.991
Did you see what they did to his son?

44:21.201 --> 44:24.913
How many families has Pablo Escobar
destroyed, Peña? Do you know?

44:27.624 --> 44:30.085
You don't decide who lives and who dies.

44:30.169 --> 44:34.298
Don't be fucking stupid.
This is how we do it.

45:01.283 --> 45:08.123
<i>I understand that you're trying to prevent
Escobar's family from entering Germany.</i>

45:08.207 --> 45:09.958
Let's make something clear:

45:10.042 --> 45:14.630
If you've come to plead for them
as part of some deal, the only--

45:14.713 --> 45:16.465
No, Mr. President.

45:17.383 --> 45:24.348
I haven't come to plead for them.
I've come to plead for you.

45:26.433 --> 45:28.644
For me? How so?

45:28.727 --> 45:32.898
I know that you want Escobar dead.

45:32.981 --> 45:37.361
And while I don't agree with that,
I understand it.

45:38.362 --> 45:42.616
But this... this I can't understand.

45:43.492 --> 45:46.703
This isn't just wrong.

45:46.787 --> 45:53.585
It puts you, the president of Colombia,
in league with a death squad.

45:55.003 --> 46:01.218
Call the German chancellor.
Tell him to let the family in.

46:20.487 --> 46:24.533
Mrs. Escobar, I'm sorry to inform you that
your entry into Germany has been denied.

46:27.828 --> 46:30.456
I know my rights, sir.
But you don't understand.

46:30.539 --> 46:33.709
My children are in danger.
Send me any place other than Colombia.

46:34.793 --> 46:40.424
Tell him the children are under age.
We just want to live in peace...

46:41.592 --> 46:47.306
No. Tell him that's all we want to do.

46:47.389 --> 46:49.558
To live in peace.

46:50.476 --> 46:52.978
Get the children and your belongs.

46:53.770 --> 46:55.189
Please.

46:59.902 --> 47:03.489
They kick us out of the country and on top
of everything, they keep the money.

47:04.448 --> 47:06.492
I know. I'm going.

47:06.575 --> 47:09.578
What's this?
Why are we being treated this way?

47:11.955 --> 47:13.207
Let's go.

48:55.142 --> 48:56.560
Pardon me.

48:58.020 --> 48:59.813
I hope you enjoyed Germany.

49:22.127 --> 49:24.379
- How much for this?
- Two thousand pesos.

49:26.757 --> 49:28.050
Thank you.

50:04.670 --> 50:06.380
Ladies.

50:12.135 --> 50:13.804
Stop! National police!

50:17.182 --> 50:19.976
It's all right, ma'am, we're with
the national police. Come with us.

50:20.060 --> 50:22.729
The attorney general asked us to put you
under protective custody.

50:22.813 --> 50:26.650
Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Come with us. You'll be safe. Let's go.

50:26.733 --> 50:30.237
- Come with us.
- Let's go. Quickly. Let's go!

50:56.096 --> 50:57.264
How can I help you, boss?

50:59.599 --> 51:03.437
I want this faggot of a president
to know what happens

51:03.520 --> 51:07.315
when you're on the side
of those bastards, Los Pepes.

51:09.443 --> 51:13.613
I want to see blood.

51:15.407 --> 51:18.660
<i>I want the sky to burn with gunpowder.</i>

51:20.287 --> 51:23.707
I want you to put the biggest bomb
you can get your hands on

51:23.790 --> 51:27.210
as close as you can to
the Presidential Palace. Are we clear?

51:28.920 --> 51:30.714
As you wish, boss.

53:00.846 --> 53:03.473
My love, let's go. Let's go.

53:07.602 --> 53:11.231
Do you want one? Yes? How much?

53:11.314 --> 53:12.524
One hundred pesos.

53:14.276 --> 53:16.278
- Here.
- Thank you.

53:18.822 --> 53:21.157
- Are we going that way?
- That way, darling.

53:22.200 --> 53:26.037
You better be a doctor when you grow up.
This is very expensive.

53:26.121 --> 53:28.623
Elena! Elena, let's go!

54:33.480 --> 54:35.190
Lift him up carefully!
