anything actually happens.

14:11.915 --> 14:15.035
- Do you think?
- I don't know. How big is she?

14:15.035 --> 14:16.995
- Not that big.
- Well, there you go.

14:16.995 --> 14:20.995
And also, maybe secretly, you're
really hard, you just don't know it.

14:21.235 --> 14:24.075
- I mean, you are quite big.
- I am not secretly hard!

14:24.075 --> 14:26.715
I am very publicly soft as shit!

14:26.715 --> 14:29.515
It doesn't even matter how big I am.

14:29.515 --> 14:33.515
I dealt with situations like this all the
time when I was in the Territorial Army.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.195
What? When were you in... ?

14:38.195 --> 14:39.995
When faced with a situation or a situ,

14:39.995 --> 14:42.715
as we used to call it in the
forces, you're given two options.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.195
Fight or flight.

14:45.195 --> 14:47.995
Now obviously, trained individuals
like myself rarely ran away,

14:47.995 --> 14:51.995
but for a civilian like yourself,
it is certainly an option.

14:53.395 --> 14:54.875
There is another thing you could do.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.715
What?

14:56.715 --> 15:00.715
Just stay away from Liam.

15:02.635 --> 15:06.395
Look, I can try and have a word with
her, but Amy is a pretty difficult person.

15:06.395 --> 15:10.395
Maybe she's just all mouth and no
trousers, like a little yappy dog.

15:11.555 --> 15:13.235
Yeah, I don't know about that one.

15:13.235 --> 15:15.195
Apparently she got kicked
out of her old college.

15:15.195 --> 15:17.915
- What?!
- Well, I don't know if it's true,

15:17.915 --> 15:21.115
but they were thinking about putting her
in, like, a young offenders' institute.

15:21.115 --> 15:23.595
- What did she do?
- It doesn't matter, I was just saying.

15:23.595 --> 15:25.195
What did she do, Chloe?!

15:25.195 --> 15:29.155
Apparently, she... she attacked someone.

15:29.155 --> 15:31.235
- Put them in hospital.
- Oh, my God.

15:31.235 --> 15:33.115
Yeah, well, that doesn't
matter anyway, Rae,

15:33.115 --> 15:36.715
cos you're going to stay away from
Liam. Aren't you? Aren't you, Rae?

15:36.715 --> 15:39.955
Yeah.

15:39.955 --> 15:43.075
By the way, do you know what's
going on with Archie at the minute?

15:43.075 --> 15:44.515
No, why?

15:44.515 --> 15:47.995
Apparently he's thinking
about jacking in college.

15:47.995 --> 15:51.995
♪ Would you stay on standby? ♪

15:52.995 --> 15:56.475
♪ Because I need another alibi ♪

15:56.475 --> 15:58.635

15:58.635 --> 16:02.635
Rae!

16:03.035 --> 16:05.995
Get away from me! Why?!

16:05.995 --> 16:09.995
SHE SIGHS

16:10.355 --> 16:13.595
Your girlfriend, who is nuttier
than squirrel shit, by the way,

16:13.595 --> 16:17.585
- is going to kill me if she sees us together.
- She won't. It'll be fine.

16:18.595 --> 16:20.615
Are you going to tell her
we were at group therapy?

16:20.635 --> 16:22.875
I don't think that will be necessary.

16:22.875 --> 16:26.355
OK. Well, it's been nice knowing you.

16:26.355 --> 16:28.435
Look!

16:28.435 --> 16:30.515
I'm not stopping seeing you.

16:30.515 --> 16:32.755
I like being around you.

16:32.811 --> 16:34.491
I'll sort it out.

16:34.491 --> 16:38.331
I'll have a word with
her. Calm things down.

16:38.331 --> 16:42.331
I promise. OK?

16:43.771 --> 16:47.771
RAE CHUCKLES

16:51.651 --> 16:55.651
KNOCKING

16:58.331 --> 17:02.331
There's a place I go whenever I'm
in need of calming down a little.

17:09.691 --> 17:13.691
LAUGHTER

17:14.090 --> 17:18.090
- Say when.
- When. Shukran.

17:18.171 --> 17:21.411
Rae, erm, what a pleasant surprise.

17:21.411 --> 17:24.290
- Imam, this is my daughter, Rachel.
- Hi.

17:24.290 --> 17:28.290
As-salaam alaikum.

17:29.371 --> 17:33.371
Would you care to join me in
the kitchen for a quick chat?

17:35.571 --> 17:37.891
First of all, why aren't you at college?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.851
Because I decided to come home early.

17:39.851 --> 17:43.851
Second of all, I specifically
told you to do something with this.

17:44.411 --> 17:47.611
It's horrendous. I feel like I'm
living in a gay giant's jewellery box.

17:47.611 --> 17:50.571
- I'm throwing it out.
- No, you can't! I'm going to use it!

17:50.571 --> 17:51.691
Rae!

17:51.691 --> 17:54.691
This is very important to
me, so just be bloody normal!

17:54.691 --> 17:58.691
Just for five minutes!

17:59.811 --> 18:03.811
Inshallah, we can soon open our arms
and welcome a new child to Islam.

18:06.771 --> 18:10.451
It's very important to Karim
that his baby be born unto Islam.

18:10.451 --> 18:13.091
And thus, it's very important to me, too.

18:13.091 --> 18:17.091
I've been reading your book, and
I must say, it speaketh to me.

18:17.571 --> 18:20.051
Holy shit.

18:20.051 --> 18:23.131
Rachel Earl!

18:23.131 --> 18:27.131
Sorry. Sorry.

18:27.371 --> 18:30.571
More tea, Imam?

18:30.571 --> 18:33.451
Say when.

18:33.451 --> 18:35.451
Oh, hiya, Amy.

18:35.451 --> 18:36.611
Hiya, Rae.

18:36.611 --> 18:40.611
Could you come out here so
we can have a little chat?

18:42.211 --> 18:45.571
No.

18:45.571 --> 18:49.571
Get out here now or I'll kick the door in.

18:55.771 --> 18:57.771
I told you to stay away from him.

18:57.771 --> 19:01.771
- I told you you weren't going to be friends.
- Just smack her.

19:02.731 --> 19:05.331
Amy, she's clearly lying.

19:05.331 --> 19:09.331
I'm not! There's nothing going on
between us! I don't fancy him at all!

19:09.571 --> 19:11.931
- Are you saying he's ugly?
- No.

19:11.931 --> 19:14.411
So you're saying he's fit?

19:14.411 --> 19:18.171
- No.
- Which are you saying?

19:18.171 --> 19:20.931
Oh, bollocks.

19:20.931 --> 19:24.931
I'm saying that he is
moderately good-looking,

19:26.091 --> 19:28.251
but within that, he's not my type.

19:28.251 --> 19:32.251
She's bullshitting you,
Amy. Just smack 'er.

19:32.691 --> 19:36.691
You can't let her do this to you.
Everyone knows she's up to something.

19:37.931 --> 19:39.571
She's trying to embarrass you.

19:39.571 --> 19:41.971
Do you think you're harder
than me, just cos you're big?

19:41.971 --> 19:45.651
No, I don't. I'm not hard at
all! Oh, no, please, Amy, don't.

19:45.651 --> 19:49.651
Er, I don't know what the bloody hell
is going on out here, but it ends now!

19:50.851 --> 19:52.731
Now.

19:52.731 --> 19:54.691
We should go.

19:54.691 --> 19:58.571
You've got until Friday after college
to tell me where you were with him.

19:58.571 --> 20:02.171
Otherwise you and I are going to
have a chat down Bennett Lane rec.

20:02.171 --> 20:06.171
Understood?

20:11.331 --> 20:14.971
I'd already messed up one person's
life by blurting out their secrets.

20:14.971 --> 20:18.971
I couldn't do it again. I needed
Liam to tell the truth himself.

20:19.251 --> 20:21.971
- SHE KNOCKS
- Liam?!

20:21.971 --> 20:24.211
Liam!

20:24.211 --> 20:28.211
SHE SIGHS

20:29.051 --> 20:32.411
Dear Diary, it was then I
realised why I'd taken the clock

20:32.411 --> 20:35.891
- off my wall in the first place.
- LOUD TICKING

20:35.891 --> 20:39.891
Every tick and every tock made each
molecule in my body twist and hurt.

20:40.131 --> 20:43.611
It reminded me, with a dark sickness,

20:43.611 --> 20:47.611
that Friday was rushing
towards me like a steam train.

20:52.411 --> 20:54.851
I couldn't believe I was thinking it,

20:54.851 --> 20:57.251
but maybe my best option
was to face up to Amy.

20:57.251 --> 20:59.691
I was bigger than her.
Maybe I stood a chance.

20:59.691 --> 21:02.451
- Aiee-yah! The
problem was,- _

21:02.451 --> 21:06.171
I couldn't fight my way
out of a wet paper bag.

21:06.171 --> 21:09.291
I needed backup.

21:09.291 --> 21:13.291
I'll fight with you, Rae. I
don't how to do it, but I'll try.

21:13.811 --> 21:16.171
You know I'm there, Raemundo. I'll step in.

21:16.171 --> 21:18.531
She won't touch you. You
can't hit a girl, though.

21:18.531 --> 21:21.371
I'm not saying I'm going to hit her.
I'm going to pull a bounce on that shit.

21:21.371 --> 21:23.651
- We can all do it.
- What about next time though,

21:23.651 --> 21:27.571
when none of us are there?
What's going to happen then?

21:27.571 --> 21:29.691
I'm going to get murdered.

21:29.691 --> 21:33.691
- Hi, guys.
- ARCHIE: Hi.

21:35.051 --> 21:37.371
Did you speak to Amy?

21:37.371 --> 21:39.011
Look, Rae, I can't take sides on this.

21:39.011 --> 21:42.731
Chloe, you're supposed to be my best mate.

21:42.731 --> 21:45.851
Yeah, well, Amy told me how
you two keep going off together.

21:45.851 --> 21:48.851
It is suspicious, Rae. I'd
be suspicious if I were her.

21:48.851 --> 21:50.371
There is nothing going on.

21:50.371 --> 21:54.371
Where did you even meet him?
How did you start hanging around?

21:54.931 --> 21:56.571
I can't tell you.

21:56.571 --> 21:58.411
Right, well, I can't help you.

21:58.411 --> 22:01.091
He...

22:01.091 --> 22:02.931
He just gets me.

22:02.931 --> 22:06.651
What? And I don't?

22:06.651 --> 22:10.651
Thought I was supposed
to be your best mate.

22:10.651 --> 22:12.251
I'll see you later.

22:12.251 --> 22:16.251
SHE SIGHS

22:18.451 --> 22:21.091
I could teach you how
to defend yourself, Rae.

22:21.091 --> 22:25.091
If you wanted to, if
you think it'd be useful.

22:31.651 --> 22:35.651
I know me and Finn were just friends now,
but he was still the embodiment of horn.

22:36.771 --> 22:39.291
I still couldn't believe I'd
walked away from all that!

22:39.291 --> 22:43.291
The vagina police should
come and take my bits away.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.091
Right hand. Go on.

22:47.091 --> 22:50.731
So is there anything going
on between you and Liam, then?

22:50.731 --> 22:53.131
- SHE SCOFFS
- No.

22:53.131 --> 22:56.171
Why? Do you think there is?

22:56.171 --> 22:59.171
- Amy Malone does.
- Yeah, well, she's a psycho.

22:59.171 --> 23:03.171
Is it true that she got chucked out of
college cos she... broke that guy's nose?

23:03.971 --> 23:07.411
Jesus.

23:07.411 --> 23:11.411
Here you are. Swap.

23:13.611 --> 23:16.851
I don't really know Liam, but
he seems a bit weird, doesn't he?

23:16.851 --> 23:20.851
He's actually a good laugh. Is he?

23:21.891 --> 23:25.891
He's really into his music as well.

23:27.411 --> 23:30.291
He's pretty cool once you get to know him.

23:30.291 --> 23:34.011
Is he?

23:34.011 --> 23:38.011
Here you are.

23:45.051 --> 23:47.571
- So what about you, then?
- What?

23:47.571 --> 23:50.131
Well, are you seeing anyone else?

23:50.131 --> 23:51.731
No, not really, no.

23:51.731 --> 23:55.731
Right, then left, and keep your hands up.

23:57.171 --> 24:00.291
What do you mean, not really?

24:00.291 --> 24:02.531
Well...

24:02.531 --> 24:05.131
... I've sort of got a date this Friday.

24:05.131 --> 24:09.131
Just... it's a favour for
a friend, it's no big deal.

24:09.371 --> 24:12.611
FINN GROANS

24:12.611 --> 24:14.371
Oh, my God.

24:14.371 --> 24:18.371
- That's pretty fucking good, Rae!
- I'm so sorry, Finn.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.811
I can't do this! I can't hit someone!

24:20.811 --> 24:22.120
So, what are you going to do?

24:22.121 --> 24:24.446
You can't just stand there
and let her punch you!

24:25.671 --> 24:26.991
KNOCK AT DOOR

24:26.991 --> 24:28.631
- Liam!
- DOOR BELL RINGS

24:28.631 --> 24:30.351
- Liam! Open the door!
- KNOCKING

24:30.351 --> 24:31.591
Please!

24:31.591 --> 24:35.591
Liam!

24:36.911 --> 24:38.911
Since Liam was avoiding me,

24:38.911 --> 24:41.711
and since I couldn't fight,
there was only one option left.

24:41.711 --> 24:45.711
Flight.

24:49.631 --> 24:53.631
The problem is that I had no car,
no cash and no place to fly to.

24:57.591 --> 24:59.483
- Are you all right, Arch?
- There's a rumour going round

24:59.485 --> 25:02.511
- you're in a spot of bother.
- Something like that, yeah.

25:04.631 --> 25:08.631
Get in then.

25:19.871 --> 25:23.471
- SIGHS
- Fucking Friday.

25:23.471 --> 25:27.311
- I'm sorry, Arch.
- Don't be.

25:27.311 --> 25:28.991
I've been an arse.

25:28.991 --> 25:30.991
I deserve everything I get.

25:33.311 --> 25:36.191
So, what's the plan?

25:36.191 --> 25:38.391
I don't have one.

25:39.391 --> 25:41.391
I just know I don't want
to be here on Friday.

25:50.111 --> 25:52.471
We're getting out of here, Rae.

25:52.471 --> 25:55.751
We're leaving our troubles behind.

25:55.751 --> 25:58.351
Look at that grey concrete disappearing.

25:58.351 --> 26:00.431
Look at those green fields.

26:00.431 --> 26:04.431
Feels good, doesn't it? You feel good?

26:04.911 --> 26:07.671
Feels good.

26:07.671 --> 26:11.671

Do you know who J Bruce Ismay is?

26:35.511 --> 26:37.641
No.

26:37.651 --> 26:41.491
He was the managing director
of the White Star Lines.

26:41.491 --> 26:44.011
He oversaw the construction of the Titanic.

26:44.011 --> 26:46.851
Sailed with her on her maiden voyage.

26:46.851 --> 26:50.851
When the ship sank, he abandoned
it and left 1,500 people to die.

26:53.611 --> 26:56.571
He's one of the greatest
cowards in history.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.531
But no-one remembers the cowards, really.

26:58.531 --> 27:02.291
People remember the heroes.

27:02.291 --> 27:04.851
You're not a coward.

27:04.851 --> 27:07.691
I am, Rae.

27:07.691 --> 27:11.691
What are you most scared of?

27:12.611 --> 27:16.611
- Homo.
- What?

27:16.651 --> 27:18.211
Gay. Poof.

27:18.211 --> 27:20.131
Bender, queer, faggot.

27:20.131 --> 27:21.931
- Nancy boy.
- Stop now.

27:21.931 --> 27:25.651
Poofter, shirt lifter, uphill gardener,

27:25.651 --> 27:28.851
fudge nudger, queen, babba stabba.

27:28.851 --> 27:31.951
Archie, give up!

where it's over in an afternoon.

27:42.001 --> 27:46.001
It's for ever.

27:49.001 --> 27:52.721
Do you know who I'm most worried about?

27:52.721 --> 27:56.721
It's not my parents, and
it's not the lads at college.

27:56.721 --> 27:59.801
It's Finn.

27:59.801 --> 28:03.041
We've been mates since primary.

28:03.041 --> 28:07.041
We've had sleepovers, we've
topped and tailed in the same bed.

28:08.761 --> 28:11.241
When he finds out, I don't want
him thinking back to them times

28:11.241 --> 28:14.761
and getting the wrong idea.

28:14.761 --> 28:17.761
He's my mate, you know.

CLOCK TICKING

29:02.521 --> 29:05.521

29:05.521 --> 29:09.521
The ticking of that hideous clock,
pulling my thoughts towards Friday.

29:09.721 --> 29:11.441
Friday, Friday!

29:11.441 --> 29:15.441
Bollocks to my mum. It had
to go back in the cupboard.

29:16.481 --> 29:20.481
KESTER: Are you OK?

29:21.681 --> 29:25.401
I wanted to talk to you about Liam.

29:25.401 --> 29:29.401
What about him?

29:30.081 --> 29:34.081
Well, he's going through
a lot at the moment.

29:34.241 --> 29:36.161
He's been through a lot, too.

29:36.161 --> 29:41.161
- Yeah, I know.
- I just want you to be, um... careful.

29:41.921 --> 29:45.201
- That's all.
- Why?

29:45.201 --> 29:47.041
What do you think he's going to do?

29:47.041 --> 29:49.721
I don't think he's going to
do anything. I just want...

29:49.721 --> 29:51.761
You don't even know him.

29:51.761 --> 29:55.681
- I know him pretty well.
- You don't know him like I do.

29:55.681 --> 29:58.721
He's exactly like me, and you
saying that you don't like him

29:58.721 --> 30:01.341
is like you saying that you don't like me.

30:01.356 --> 30:03.236
I didn't say I didn't like him, Rae.

30:03.236 --> 30:05.436
He worries like me, he's big like me,

30:05.436 --> 30:07.836
he's got the same secrets and problems,

30:07.836 --> 30:09.796
he understands what it's like.

30:09.796 --> 30:12.396
It's my job as a friend to protect that.

30:12.396 --> 30:16.196
It's my job not to betray him.

30:16.196 --> 30:18.916
What do you mean, betray him?

30:19.916 --> 30:22.076
There's a girl at college

30:22.076 --> 30:25.036
who wants to beat me up on Friday,

30:25.036 --> 30:27.796
because she thinks that
there's something going on

30:27.796 --> 30:31.796
between me and her
boyfriend, but there isn't.

30:32.796 --> 30:34.756
And how do you think that makes her feel?

30:34.756 --> 30:36.676
Humiliated, I guess.

30:36.676 --> 30:39.556
- Have you tried talking to her?
- Yeah.

30:39.556 --> 30:40.465
I've tried.

30:40.466 --> 30:43.155
Get her on her own, somewhere
she can't feel humiliated,

30:43.156 --> 30:46.596
see if that makes a difference.

30:46.596 --> 30:49.036
I'm scared.

30:49.036 --> 30:51.436
- You're afraid of getting hurt.
- Obviously!

30:51.436 --> 30:55.436
And it's going to be in front of
everyone, which just makes it worse.

30:56.476 --> 31:00.476
I hate that I'm the kind of
person that's scared of everything.

31:00.516 --> 31:04.156
I never used to be like this.

31:04.156 --> 31:08.156
- I used to be brave.
- And what happened?

31:09.716 --> 31:13.716
The world happened.

31:13.836 --> 31:16.916
The world happened.

31:16.916 --> 31:20.516
The world is always going to happen, Rae.

31:20.516 --> 31:24.516
And being brave isn't
about never being afraid.

31:24.796 --> 31:28.796
It's about what you do when you
are. Whether you can keep your head.

31:29.436 --> 31:33.436
Whether you do the right thing.

31:35.196 --> 31:36.796
I had to see if Kester was right.

31:36.796 --> 31:40.796
I had to get her on her own,
try and make her see sense.

31:46.556 --> 31:49.719
- What are you doing 'ere?
- I wanted to talk to you.

31:49.720 --> 31:50.720
So talk to me.

31:50.876 --> 31:54.876
Start by telling me what you were
doing behind the curtain in college.

31:55.556 --> 31:59.316
I was telling Liam about
how your feelings were hurt.

31:59.316 --> 32:03.316
And how he should
explain that me and him...

32:03.356 --> 32:05.916
... we're not up to anything.

32:05.916 --> 32:09.916
And you've never done anything
with him?... Not even kissed him?

32:10.596 --> 32:13.476
Not even kissed him.

32:13.476 --> 32:16.596
'I do so hate it when Kester's right.'

32:16.596 --> 32:19.116
'But sometimes, I love
it in equal measure.'

32:19.116 --> 32:21.836
We couldn't find your...

32:21.836 --> 32:23.196
'Oh, shit.'

32:23.196 --> 32:25.276
What's she doing here?

32:25.276 --> 32:29.276
- She's come to beg me not to fight her.
- Well?

32:30.196 --> 32:34.076
Did she tell you where she
keeps sneaking off with Liam?

32:34.076 --> 32:38.076
No. She didn't.

32:38.756 --> 32:42.596
I can't.

32:42.596 --> 32:44.236
I can't tell you.

32:44.236 --> 32:48.236
See you tomorrow after college, then.

32:55.996 --> 32:58.916
- Liam. I need you to open the door.
- DOOR BELL RINGS

32:58.916 --> 33:02.916
Liam!

33:15.116 --> 33:16.316
Come in.

33:16.316 --> 33:18.836
I'm trying to protect you.

33:18.836 --> 33:22.836
I'm trying to help you, and
you just keep avoiding me.

33:23.156 --> 33:25.636
I know it's no-one else's business,

33:25.636 --> 33:28.436
- but you have to tell Amy about group.
- No.

33:28.436 --> 33:30.276
- Liam!
- I can't do it.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.756
I don't want to do it.
You don't understand.

33:32.756 --> 33:34.036
Of course I understand!

33:34.036 --> 33:38.036
I had to admit to everyone
that I'd been locked up.

33:38.356 --> 33:39.836
You're not even that bad.

33:39.836 --> 33:41.756
Liam, please!

33:41.756 --> 33:45.316
If you don't tell her,
then... I'll have to.

33:45.316 --> 33:46.796
You're giving me no choice.

33:46.796 --> 33:48.916
No. Please, Rae.

33:48.916 --> 33:52.876
- Well, it's either that or I get my face smashed in.
- Please.

33:52.876 --> 33:55.796
Please.

33:55.796 --> 33:57.036
Please.

33:57.036 --> 34:01.036
'And that's when I realised, we
were more alike than I ever imagined.'

34:01.516 --> 34:04.356
'He was as terrified as I'd been.'

34:04.356 --> 34:07.196
'I'd seen that look many times before.'

34:07.196 --> 34:11.196
'Normally it's on my face,
staring back in the mirror.'

34:11.436 --> 34:13.476

GASPS Chloe!

42:30.426 --> 42:33.506
I'm so sorry!

42:33.506 --> 42:35.946
Yeah.

42:35.946 --> 42:39.226
'Like I said, me and Liam are the same.'

42:39.226 --> 42:43.226
'We're both mad, we're both
fat and we both let people down.'

42:56.706 --> 43:00.706
'There's a place I go
whenever I need calming down.'

43:04.786 --> 43:08.426
'Like Kester says, the
world is going to happen,

43:08.426 --> 43:11.666
whether you like it or not.'

43:11.666 --> 43:15.666
GROANS Ow!

43:17.946 --> 43:21.946
- GROANS
- Ow!

43:30.706 --> 43:32.586
TV ON

43:32.586 --> 43:33.866
How are you feeling, love?

43:33.866 --> 43:35.506
Has that ointment helped?

43:35.506 --> 43:37.546
Yeah.

43:37.546 --> 43:40.466
Thanks.

43:40.466 --> 43:44.466
SIGHS

43:46.866 --> 43:50.866
TV: So, contestant number one,
please, tell us about yourself.

43:51.066 --> 43:53.306
What were you and those
girls up to the other day?

43:53.306 --> 43:56.786
Nothing. Just messing around.

43:56.786 --> 44:00.786
Yeah, well, just tell me if
there's anything going on.

44:00.986 --> 44:04.986
I don't mind giving people a
clip behind the ear if I have to.

44:05.026 --> 44:09.026
Especially if they're messing
with my little chicken.

44:12.706 --> 44:16.706
I can't believe you're giving up bacon.

44:19.226 --> 44:20.266
No, neither can I.

44:20.266 --> 44:23.226
You.

44:23.226 --> 44:25.546
You're like Queen of bacon.

44:25.546 --> 44:28.386
Bacon is your life.

44:28.386 --> 44:31.466
Yeah, well, I'm pretty good
at messing things up, Rae.

44:31.466 --> 44:34.426
I've always had a talent for it.

44:34.426 --> 44:37.386
I love that man so much.

44:37.386 --> 44:40.386
Such a quiet, kind person.

44:40.386 --> 44:43.106
He's so special to me that...

44:43.106 --> 44:47.106
... I'm going to try everything I
possibly can not to mess it up.

44:47.186 --> 44:50.786
'I wish I'd tried harder not to mess
things up, because I was starting

44:50.786 --> 44:53.946
to realise that quiet,
kind, special people

44:53.946 --> 44:56.186
come along once in a lifetime.'

44:56.186 --> 44:59.186
Jesus.

44:59.186 --> 45:01.026
I wish I'd brought some bamboo.

45:01.026 --> 45:02.706
ANIMAL GRUNT

45:02.706 --> 45:06.706
Don't.

45:08.546 --> 45:12.546
How's things?

45:12.586 --> 45:14.626
How did it go with your parents?

45:14.626 --> 45:18.626
My dad went in the kitchen and made a brew.

45:18.786 --> 45:22.466
My mum asked if there were
any gay societies in Durham,

45:22.466 --> 45:25.506
- in case I get into uni there.
- Hmm.

45:25.506 --> 45:27.586
THEY LAUGH

45:27.586 --> 45:29.466
Are there?

45:29.466 --> 45:31.946
I don't know. Maybe I'll start one.

45:31.946 --> 45:34.906
Ooh. LAUGHS

45:34.906 --> 45:37.626
To be honest, I feel like a huge weight

45:37.626 --> 45:40.146
has been lifted off my shoulders.

45:40.146 --> 45:42.066
ARCHIE SIGHS

45:42.066 --> 45:43.826
YOUTH: Shoot! Shoot!

45:43.826 --> 45:47.746
Obviously, there are some people... well,

45:47.746 --> 45:51.746
I guess I just need to
give people time to adjust.

45:52.306 --> 45:54.146
But this is 1996.

45:54.146 --> 45:55.906
I guess the world's moving on.

45:55.906 --> 45:58.586
Archie. Sorry, mate.

45:58.586 --> 45:59.986
What's up?

45:59.986 --> 46:02.586
One of my brother's uni
mates is down from Glasgow,

46:02.586 --> 46:06.586
so we've got a full team.

46:07.426 --> 46:09.186
But I always play.

46:09.186 --> 46:12.386
Sorry, buddy.
