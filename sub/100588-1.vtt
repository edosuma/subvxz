00:08.926 --> 00:12.471
{\an8}[man 1] <i> Today the United States Senate
Committee on Government Operations</i>

00:12.554 --> 00:15.098
{\an8}<i>begins hearings
on federally insured banks.</i>

00:16.308 --> 00:20.020
<i>We are concerned whether existing laws
are adequate to guarantee</i>

00:20.103 --> 00:24.566
<i>the character, experience, and integrity
of people who acquire such banks,</i>

00:25.692 --> 00:28.529
<i>which are the cornerstones
of American capitalism</i>

00:29.321 --> 00:31.323
<i>and the foundation of the American dream.</i>

00:57.808 --> 01:01.812
[man 2] <i> Be careful in there, Bernard.
They want to make an example out of you.</i>

01:16.702 --> 01:19.371
[man 1] Committee calls Bernard S. Garrett
to testify.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.668
Mr. Garrett,
I think you understand the stakes.

01:33.552 --> 01:34.845
{\an8}[man 3] Carlyle and Spring?

01:34.928 --> 01:38.223
{\an8}[man 4] Right. Annual rental income
80,000, which is strong,

01:38.307 --> 01:40.976
but Mr. Miller wants us
to use a six multiplier to value it.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.436
[man 3] That's too high.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.731
[man 4] He's coming in an hour
to negotiate on it. Maybe you can step in.

01:45.814 --> 01:46.815
[man 3] All right.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.321
Boy does a pretty good shine.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.465
[man 4] Harder worker than most of 'em.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.073
There may not be comps in Willis,

02:09.127 --> 02:11.715
but take a look at
the other properties I own in the county.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.300
A six multiple is reasonable.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.136
[man 3]
Your other buildings are in Conroe,

02:16.220 --> 02:17.930
which is booming with the oil find.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.599
So, I'm not sure this is a good comp.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.267
Willis is booming too.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.186
Hey! What are you doing up there, boy?

02:24.269 --> 02:26.396
You spying on these
white people's business? Huh?

02:33.070 --> 02:34.071
Get back here!

02:36.406 --> 02:37.967
- Your dad's gonna hear about this!
- [horn honks]

02:37.991 --> 02:38.992
[man] Hey! Watch it, boy!

02:59.304 --> 03:02.891
What do you think them white folks would
do if they knew you were spying on them?

03:04.768 --> 03:07.062
When I was growing up
I've seen boys killed for less.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.860
You know what it's like to see a young boy
hanging dead from a tree?

03:14.236 --> 03:17.614
And don't think because it hasn't happened
recently, it couldn't happen again.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.741
I was just trying to learn
how they make money.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.915
You are so talented.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.418
How did you learn all this?

03:34.006 --> 03:35.757
You was born the wrong color, son.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.676
Negro man can't earn money with this.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.262
White man won't let him,
no matter how good at it you are.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.557
Maybe not in Texas.

03:46.143 --> 03:49.354
You really think it's gonna be different
for you, you go somewhere else?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.897
[woman] We're in California.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.440
[laughs]

04:33.732 --> 04:35.901
- [exhales]
- What's wrong?

04:37.402 --> 04:40.155
Just looking forward
to having dinner with your uncle.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.908
- [utensils clattering]
- [woman clears throat]

04:43.784 --> 04:46.745
Well, the aircraft companies are booming.

04:47.287 --> 04:51.166
Northrop is looking to hire 5,000
new workers for their assembly line

04:51.250 --> 04:53.001
and they hire our kind.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.254
And I can get you
an interview there tomorrow.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.465
Well, thank you, sir. But I came here
to try my hand at real estate.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.468
There's not a lot
of colored real estate agents.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.095
Owning property and renting it out.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.347
[laughing]

05:05.430 --> 05:06.932
You married a millionaire, Eunice?

05:07.516 --> 05:09.101
- [all laughing]
- Deacon.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.480
Well, I sure hope you're close, son.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.858
This isn't some one-horse town in Texas.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.568
Real estate is expensive here.

05:18.277 --> 05:21.572
Bernard saved up money
from a company we started in Houston.

05:22.865 --> 05:26.326
So, what do you plan to do
until you find something you can afford?

05:26.410 --> 05:27.494
Keep looking.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.705
And spend down your savings
till they're gone?

05:30.289 --> 05:31.623
And then can't pay your rent?

05:31.707 --> 05:33.083
Deacon, stop.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.420
You'll get your rent
the first of every month,

05:36.503 --> 05:37.963
one month in advance.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.382
I should go get Bernard Jr. in bed.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.342
Excuse me.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.608
<i>Eunice, what does your husband have
against working?</i>

05:58.066 --> 06:01.612
If we need to supplement our income
until he finds the right property,

06:01.695 --> 06:03.322
I'll work at the Plantation Club.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.657
That ain't no place
for a married woman to work.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.260
Bernard okay with you going back there?

06:07.284 --> 06:09.161
Well, we haven't had a chance
to discuss it.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.705
If he's a real man, he won't let you.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.582
That won't be for him to decide.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.375
What does that mean?

06:16.793 --> 06:18.837
My husband is a genius.

06:18.921 --> 06:19.921
You'll see.

06:27.804 --> 06:28.889
[door closes]

06:30.807 --> 06:32.392
I know this isn't much.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.311
Yeah, I don't plan on us being here long.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.855
Why are you so hard on yourself?

06:36.939 --> 06:39.441
I don't want Bernard Jr.
Growing up in a shed.

06:40.859 --> 06:43.403
Well, I grew up in a shed.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.448
Abraham Lincoln grew up in a shed.

06:46.532 --> 06:48.575
Abraham Lincoln grew up in a log cabin.

06:48.659 --> 06:51.954
Well, that's what they call a shed
when it's in the woods.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.664
There's no difference.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.333
Well, I'm gonna get you and him
out of this shed.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.294
As soon as possible.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.719
- [man] Thanks for the lift.
- [Bernard] No problem.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.680
I'm sorry my dad was such a jerk
last night.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.266
[Bernard] Was he? I didn't notice.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.769
Hey, nice car.

07:15.853 --> 07:16.687
Thanks.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.313
Bernard, this is my friend Matt.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.678
You didn't tell me you had a rich uncle.
Nice to meet you.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.150
Hardly rich. And I'm his cousin.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.028
You got a car, you're rich to me. Hmm.

07:25.696 --> 07:27.489
Hey, good luck finding the right place.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.369
[Matt] Hey.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.665
Hey, what's your cousin do for a living?

07:37.291 --> 07:38.375
He owns buildings.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.169
Really?

07:40.544 --> 07:42.129
Damn. Huh.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.906
[on phone]
<i>Hello, my name is Bernard Garrett.</i>

07:51.930 --> 07:55.392
<i>I saw your property on Victoria Road.
I was wondering what the asking price...</i>

07:55.475 --> 07:58.163
[in person] <i> Hello, my name is
Bernard Garrett. Are you the owner of 12...</i>

07:58.187 --> 08:00.832
[on phone] <i> Hi, my name is Bernard Garrett.
I'm a real estate investor.</i>

08:00.856 --> 08:01.940
<i>What's the asking price?</i>

08:02.024 --> 08:03.024
<i>That high, huh?</i>

08:03.066 --> 08:06.045
[in person] <i> How can a price that high
be sustainable, given the current rents...</i>

08:06.069 --> 08:08.256
[on phone] <i> How many units are
in the building and what are they really...</i>

08:08.280 --> 08:09.924
{\an8}<i>Looks to me
the building needs a little work.</i>

08:09.948 --> 08:11.116
{\an8}<i>Maybe we can negotiate...</i>

08:11.200 --> 08:13.619
{\an8}[in person] <i> Right. I understand.
Thank you for your time.</i>

08:16.955 --> 08:18.874
This is a white neighborhood, Bernard.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.584
Well, it won't be white for long.

08:20.667 --> 08:24.087
Not with the black neighborhood
two blocks away bursting at the seams.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.758
Well, how much
does Barker & Associates want for it?

08:28.759 --> 08:30.344
We have enough to buy it.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.721
Just won't have anything left over
to fix it up with.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.933
What if I got us a co-investor?

08:37.601 --> 08:39.895
[band playing jazz music]

08:42.856 --> 08:44.191
[Eunice chuckles]

08:50.447 --> 08:52.616
[jazz music continues]

08:54.243 --> 08:56.370
[ends]

08:58.372 --> 09:02.376
[man laughs]
All right, fellows. That was smokin'.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.585
Joe!

09:04.837 --> 09:06.296
Eunice!

09:06.380 --> 09:08.799
- You came back to me.
- [laughing]

09:09.550 --> 09:12.261
[kisses] Girl, look at you.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.137
Oh, stop it. Behave now.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.264
Oh, honey.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.141
Who's this?

09:18.225 --> 09:20.644
That uncle
you was always talking to me about?

09:20.727 --> 09:22.145
- [Bernard chuckles]
- Husband.

09:22.521 --> 09:23.689
Your hus... What?

09:23.772 --> 09:24.857
Wait.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.316
Three years.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.777
[laughs] Congratulations, man.

09:28.861 --> 09:29.987
You hit the jackpot.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.572
If you're the marrying type.

09:31.655 --> 09:36.535
I'm not, but if I were,
can't do no better than Eunice Perkins.

09:36.618 --> 09:37.661
- [chuckles]
- Garrett.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.246
Pleased to meet you, Garrett.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.455
No, I'm Bernard.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.934
I heard him say "Garrett."
Didn't you hear him say "Garrett"?

09:42.958 --> 09:44.519
- [woman 1] That's what I heard.
- [woman 2] Mm-hmm.

09:44.543 --> 09:45.836
[laughs]

09:45.919 --> 09:47.588
I'm just messing with you, man.

09:47.671 --> 09:48.672
You want a drink?

09:48.755 --> 09:49.756
It's 4:00 p.m.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.466
I know. You're starting late.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.010
I'll have 'em make it strong.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.762
Jackie, make my man here something strong.

09:55.846 --> 09:56.847
A triple.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.183
You know, see if we can blow
the stick out of his ass.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.267
[laughing]

10:00.350 --> 10:03.103
You did not even talk to him
about your idea.

10:03.187 --> 10:05.105
No way am I doing business with that man.

10:05.189 --> 10:07.649
Not for a loan.
Especially not as a business partner.

10:07.733 --> 10:08.734
He's a damn degenerate.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.652
Oh, Bernard, please!

10:12.404 --> 10:13.780
I don't need his help.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.203
You have got the wrong idea about him.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.121
Oh, really? You think so?

10:21.955 --> 10:24.082
'Cause the vice squad
seems to disagree with you.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.919
Well, that's the mayor, silly.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.338
Do you wanna meet him?
Because he's friends with Joe.

10:31.173 --> 10:32.257
No.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.135
If you won't let Joe invest,

10:35.219 --> 10:37.888
then you are gonna have to
make Barker come down on his price.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.189
Asking price is 40,000.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.233
You won't get a penny over 35.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.609
You offering 35?

10:50.692 --> 10:52.069
I can give you 30.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.072
Why would I take 30 if I can get 35?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.950
Well, the building needs renovations
to unlock its value.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.409
It's been fine for my tenants.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.453
Your tenants only occupy
half the building.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.289
But with new kitchens
and refinished floors...

11:04.373 --> 11:08.168
My tenants won't pay more even if they
can see the reflections in those floors.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.670
But another market will.

11:10.629 --> 11:13.340
Black doctors, lawyers, teachers

11:13.423 --> 11:16.802
looking for a place to move outside
the ghettos that they've been forced into.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.096
No one is going after that market.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.180
But I can.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.057
Oh.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.434
Your confidence is impressive.

11:24.518 --> 11:28.230
But 10,000 less than asking is not enough.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.191
Once I lease the units,
I can give you your full asking price.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.275
Let's say by...

11:33.485 --> 11:34.695
June.

11:34.778 --> 11:39.199
You want me to loan you $10,000
so you can buy my building?

11:39.283 --> 11:40.868
It's not a loan. It's an investment.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.077
It's a loan.

11:42.661 --> 11:46.206
For more than three times what the average
American family make in a year.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.500
- Two point four times.
- What?

11:48.584 --> 11:53.172
The average American income in 1953
was $4,233.

11:53.255 --> 11:56.508
Ten thousand is 2.4 times
the average income.

11:58.468 --> 12:02.514
Well, I admire your entrepreneurial gusto,

12:02.598 --> 12:05.517
but, uh, it's not the way I do business.

12:06.935 --> 12:07.936
I'm sorry.

12:15.986 --> 12:17.654
Thank you for your time, Mr. Barker.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.508
[man 1] Look what just walked in.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.231
[man 2] Mighty fancy for a colored fella.

12:39.927 --> 12:40.927
[man 1] We'll see.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.556
Hi. I'm Bernard Garrett.
I'd like to speak with Mr. Reed, please.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.309
I'm sorry, Mr. Reed is out.
May I take a message?

12:49.019 --> 12:52.940
I have pretty good eyesight and I can
clearly read the nameplate on his desk.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.151
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.946
Mr. Reed can't meet with you right now.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.280
But I could take a message.

13:02.157 --> 13:04.535
No. There's no message.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.411
Thank you.

13:15.587 --> 13:16.880
Mr. Reed.

13:16.964 --> 13:17.965
Do I know you?

13:18.048 --> 13:19.424
Uh, no. But you know Mr. Barker.

13:19.508 --> 13:21.385
I'd like a loan
to buy one of his buildings.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.637
Uh... Yeah, you can make
an appointment inside, please.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.765
Well, you and I both know
I'm not getting an appointment inside.

13:27.766 --> 13:30.602
Now, this deal will benefit Mr. Barker.

13:31.562 --> 13:32.563
You should hear me out.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.651
Your uncle gonna get a good laugh
out of this one.

13:40.362 --> 13:43.002
[Eunice] Keep looking. You're gonna
find yourself another building.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.158
Yeah.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.454
Come on. Time for bed, little man.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.123
- [knocking]
- Yes?

13:51.206 --> 13:54.001
[aunt]
Bernard, there's a phone call for you.

13:59.006 --> 14:02.176
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Garrett. This is Patrick Barker.</i>

14:02.801 --> 14:07.723
Did you use my name to try and get a loan
from Mr. Reed at Mid City Bank?

14:08.307 --> 14:09.975
Well, in a manner of speaking...

14:10.809 --> 14:11.643
yes.

14:11.727 --> 14:15.606
Oh. And do you think that follows
normal business customs?

14:16.940 --> 14:18.775
If I was following
normal business customs,

14:18.859 --> 14:20.903
I'd still be a shoeshine boy
in Texas, sir.

14:20.986 --> 14:23.572
I didn't ask for your biography,
Mr. Garrett.

14:23.655 --> 14:27.284
I asked if you thought
it followed normal business customs.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.038
- No.
<i>- Good.</i>

14:31.121 --> 14:33.248
Well, at least we can agree on that. Hmm.

14:34.833 --> 14:38.629
Reed wants to see you at the bank
in the morning to sign off on that loan.

14:39.213 --> 14:40.255
Excuse me?

14:40.714 --> 14:42.841
<i>I told him I'd act as guarantor.</i>

14:45.385 --> 14:46.428
You still there?

14:47.513 --> 14:48.597
Wh...

14:48.680 --> 14:50.265
Why are you doing this, Mr. Barker?

14:50.349 --> 14:52.100
Because normal business customs

14:52.184 --> 14:54.853
are in place to screw people like you,
Mr. Garrett.

14:55.312 --> 14:58.315
<i>You went to see Reed
knowing the deck was stacked</i>

14:58.398 --> 15:01.193
<i>because you have
that much confidence in this deal.</i>

15:02.194 --> 15:04.112
That tells me
all I need to know about you.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.951
Well, do you want this loan or not?

15:12.037 --> 15:13.330
Yes.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.582
[band playing jazz music]

15:18.043 --> 15:22.673
Sometimes you need to take a step back
and enjoy what you've accomplished, baby.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.858
[no audible dialogue]

15:55.914 --> 15:56.999
[Joe] You like cigars?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.335
- I don't smoke.
- Oh.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.756
[Bernard sighs]

16:09.178 --> 16:11.096
I'm not fucking your wife.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.934
You go to every table in here
to reassure your patrons of that?

16:16.018 --> 16:18.937
No. Might have to skip some of them.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.939
[chuckles]

16:21.023 --> 16:22.357
Come on, man. Lighten up.

16:22.441 --> 16:24.234
I'm not the asshole you think I am.

16:24.318 --> 16:26.403
You a different kind of asshole, huh?

16:26.486 --> 16:29.489
[laughs heartily]

16:29.573 --> 16:31.158
I've been told that, yeah.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.535
Come on. Let's go outside and talk.

16:39.374 --> 16:42.044
[music continues, muffled]

16:45.631 --> 16:46.632
[Joe exhales]

16:46.715 --> 16:48.133
What do you want from me, man?

16:48.717 --> 16:50.636
You mean aside from your wife?

16:52.221 --> 16:53.680
[chuckles]

16:53.764 --> 16:57.559
Look, I like seeing black men succeed.

16:57.643 --> 17:00.646
Sometimes I even invest
some of my own money to back them.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.357
But you don't even know me.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.442
I know you're smart and ambitious.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.654
You and I both know that's not enough.

17:08.737 --> 17:10.239
You're also angry.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.241
But you don't show it.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.576
That's the best kind of anger.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.743
Fuels you without making you a target.

17:17.913 --> 17:18.914
I'm not angry.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.085
Yeah, all right.

17:27.923 --> 17:28.966
Nice glasses.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.467
You near-sighted or far-sighted?

17:31.134 --> 17:32.135
Does it matter?

17:33.053 --> 17:35.138
Just wondering what you'd look like
without 'em.

17:40.853 --> 17:42.437
So, you trust this Barker?

17:43.522 --> 17:44.773
He didn't have to help me.

17:45.858 --> 17:49.236
What if you can't finish the work
or rent the units fast enough?

17:50.112 --> 17:51.154
I'll make the date.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.826
See? Anger.

17:57.536 --> 17:58.912
I'm gonna get another drink.

18:03.917 --> 18:04.960
I'm not angry.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.337
[Joe] Yes, you are.

18:17.222 --> 18:18.765
What are you doing here?

18:19.224 --> 18:22.769
Ma'am, uh, I'm Bernard Garrett.

18:22.853 --> 18:25.105
Just doing some renovations
on the empty apartments.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.274
What hours do you work?

18:27.357 --> 18:31.278
Well, the city say all construction has to
be done between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.

18:31.361 --> 18:34.698
- So, if you need any improvements...
- I don't need improvements.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.868
And you can tell
that mick that owns this place,

18:37.951 --> 18:41.413
when he goes jacking the rent,
he ain't jacking mine.

18:41.496 --> 18:42.496
Yes, ma'am.

18:42.539 --> 18:45.751
Mr. Barker was very clear about your lease
when he sold me the building.

18:46.835 --> 18:49.004
Don't you sass me, boy.

18:49.379 --> 18:50.881
This is a white building.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.634
You can't own this place.

19:04.061 --> 19:06.813
Hey, why don't you grab that scraper
and start on the other end?

19:07.356 --> 19:08.398
All right.

19:10.234 --> 19:11.276
- Hey, man.
- [Matt] Hey.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.195
Hey, thanks for coming.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.279
Of course.

19:15.781 --> 19:16.865
How's it going?

19:17.491 --> 19:19.076
I can offer you a buck-fifty an hour.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.410
That's great.

19:20.494 --> 19:22.204
And you're fine with working for me?

19:22.287 --> 19:24.122
I've been working for other men
my whole life.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.750
Right. But are you okay
with working for <i>me</i> ?

19:27.876 --> 19:30.838
Well, your money is green.
That's the only concern about color I got.

19:31.255 --> 19:33.549
And I like the idea
of watching you build a business.

19:33.632 --> 19:35.759
It's something I'd like to do again
myself one day.

19:35.843 --> 19:36.885
- "Again"?
- Mmm.

19:36.969 --> 19:38.887
Yeah, I tried something a few years back.

19:38.971 --> 19:41.181
It was a drive-in ice cream shop.

19:41.974 --> 19:45.352
Well, it turns out people don't wanna
eat ice cream while driving their cars.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.274
- You serious?
- Oh, yeah.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.025
[scoffs]

19:54.903 --> 19:56.280
- Let's get to work.
- Yeah.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.660
Connect it here. Like this.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.162
Should be good.

20:13.839 --> 20:14.840
Step back.

20:19.178 --> 20:20.179
Right there.

20:20.846 --> 20:22.931
We want to scrape these railings
up to the front

20:23.015 --> 20:25.601
and paint our way back
and then go back with the stucco.

20:25.684 --> 20:28.020
Go from the top. Let's work our way down.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.521
- Bernard Garrett.
- Then let's...

20:31.064 --> 20:32.858
Yes, Officer. Is there a problem?

20:32.941 --> 20:34.610
We received a complaint about you.

20:35.110 --> 20:38.197
Ms. Cooper in Apartment 2A
does not like you working in the building.

20:39.489 --> 20:40.324
Why not?

20:40.407 --> 20:42.260
She said you were impersonating
the owner of the building.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.912
- No, he owns the building.
- I'm not talking to you.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.625
I do own the building, Officer.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.169
Um, all the paperwork is filed downtown.

20:52.252 --> 20:55.214
But I keep a copy with me,
just to be safe.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.554
This actually looks real.

21:08.352 --> 21:10.604
[scoffs] Yeah, I guess so.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.025
Try to be more respectful to your tenants.

21:16.485 --> 21:17.694
Yes, sir, Officer.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.447
Sorry for the inconvenience.

21:30.249 --> 21:33.627
You can't be here after 6:00 p.m.

21:33.710 --> 21:36.672
A contractor can't be here
after 6:00 p.m., Ms. Cooper.

21:37.214 --> 21:38.590
I'm a resident.

21:38.674 --> 21:39.675
I'm moving in.

21:44.096 --> 21:46.056
- [gasps]
- [door closes]

21:55.649 --> 21:57.693
I hope your mother enjoys her new place.

21:57.776 --> 21:59.069
Oh, I'm sure she will.

21:59.152 --> 22:00.654
- Mrs. Garrett?
- Yes.

22:00.737 --> 22:03.782
Anita Jefferson. We spoke about
leasing one of your apartments?

22:03.866 --> 22:05.784
Oh, yes, of course. It's nice to meet you.

22:08.620 --> 22:09.830
Fully leased.

22:09.913 --> 22:11.957
[Barker chuckles] Impressive.

22:15.544 --> 22:18.463
I have my eye on a place
two blocks east of here.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.132
You interested?

22:20.215 --> 22:21.216
You mean a partnership?

22:22.134 --> 22:23.260
Yeah. 50-50.

22:24.178 --> 22:25.262
But on one condition.

22:27.514 --> 22:28.515
Bernard...

22:29.141 --> 22:30.392
I do business with people

22:31.059 --> 22:33.103
who turn away from me
after we shake on the deal

22:33.187 --> 22:35.606
and wash their hands
because I'm a dirty Irishman.

22:36.690 --> 22:39.943
[sighs] But they do business with me
because I make them money.

22:41.278 --> 22:44.907
Now, you have the knack of knowing
the untapped value of a building.

22:46.617 --> 22:48.535
You'll work the phones with me.

22:49.995 --> 22:51.079
Work the investors.

22:51.914 --> 22:55.751
But when we need a face to sign the deal,
that'll be me.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.420
And we'll make money.

22:59.505 --> 23:00.506
A lot of it.

23:02.966 --> 23:03.967
Fifty-fifty?

23:06.678 --> 23:07.888
Fifty-fifty.

23:14.937 --> 23:15.938
This is it. Right here.

23:16.355 --> 23:17.356
There we go.

23:19.691 --> 23:20.692
Your signature.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.613
[indistinct]

23:28.283 --> 23:29.701
[phone rings]

23:30.327 --> 23:31.578
Hello? Yeah.

23:32.204 --> 23:33.205
Oh, right.

23:33.288 --> 23:34.998
[indistinct]

23:35.082 --> 23:36.602
Yeah, I was calling about the house...

23:52.057 --> 23:53.100
[camera shutter clicks]

23:58.397 --> 23:59.565
Oh.

24:01.984 --> 24:03.861
[Bernard] Let's try the sofa over here.

24:03.944 --> 24:06.321
Lamp. Right here in the corner.

24:06.405 --> 24:08.490
It's perfect. Perfect. Perfect.

24:08.991 --> 24:10.909
That looks great.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.370
What do you think, baby? It's nice, right?

24:13.453 --> 24:15.956
Uh, well. I think there's something
going on with the car.

24:16.039 --> 24:17.207
You wanna go check on it?

24:19.001 --> 24:20.460
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

24:21.753 --> 24:24.256
Okay, let's move the table there,
slide the couch in,

24:24.339 --> 24:25.966
and put the lamp on the other side.

24:26.717 --> 24:29.636
And don't you dare let him move anything
when he gets back. Okay?

24:29.720 --> 24:31.040
- [Matt] Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

24:33.682 --> 24:37.269
[Bernard] Barker and I have been thinking
about diversifying in single family homes.

24:38.395 --> 24:39.396
So...

24:40.314 --> 24:44.651
want you to go in, tell me
what you think this house needs.

24:49.489 --> 24:50.699
Oh.

24:52.492 --> 24:53.577
- Bernard.
- [door closes]

24:56.079 --> 24:57.706
This place is beautiful.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.459
Huh. You think?

25:00.959 --> 25:02.711
- Yes.
- Does it need anything?

25:02.794 --> 25:03.962
Furniture.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.715
So I did a good job, huh?

25:06.798 --> 25:08.634
Well, it depends on the price, doesn't it?

25:10.344 --> 25:11.470
Not this time, baby.

25:14.348 --> 25:16.099
Go on. Take it. I already got a set.

25:16.183 --> 25:17.559
Oh. [chuckles]

25:18.227 --> 25:20.020
Are you serious?

25:20.437 --> 25:21.980
[both laughing]

25:22.064 --> 25:23.065
[kisses]

25:23.148 --> 25:25.275
[clock chiming]

25:25.359 --> 25:27.152
You really sleeping in late.

25:27.736 --> 25:29.488
Time to get up, dear.

25:36.954 --> 25:38.539
[ragged breathing]

25:43.836 --> 25:45.879
[man]
<i>Mrs. Barker would like to offer a buyout</i>

25:45.963 --> 25:49.383
for your interest
in all the Barker/Garrett properties.

25:49.466 --> 25:51.134
I have no reason to sell.

25:51.218 --> 25:53.053
I'm happy running the buildings on my own.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.513
That's unacceptable.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.036
I don't wanna be in business with...

25:57.724 --> 26:00.853
I prefer not to continue the arrangement.

26:02.729 --> 26:03.981
What's the offer?

26:12.948 --> 26:14.533
This is outrageous.

26:14.616 --> 26:17.661
I own 50% of a dozen properties.

26:17.744 --> 26:20.205
You want me to give it up
for pennies on the dollar?

26:20.289 --> 26:22.666
I don't have to pay you anything.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.294
Your name doesn't appear
on any of the deeds.

26:25.377 --> 26:26.503
Well, it couldn't.

26:27.004 --> 26:28.130
We had an agreement.

26:28.213 --> 26:30.841
And we all know
what your husband's intentions were.

26:35.220 --> 26:38.265
I will up my offer
to 25 cents on the dollar.

26:38.348 --> 26:40.517
And if you see fit
to refuse that, Mr. Garrett,

26:40.601 --> 26:42.227
you can walk away with nothing

26:42.769 --> 26:44.688
unless you wanna face me
in a court of law.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.773
With a different lawyer.

26:50.611 --> 26:53.197
[door opens, closes]

26:53.280 --> 26:55.657
There has to be a way
to prove Mr. Barker's intentions.

26:55.741 --> 26:57.868
Well, if you could find a witness, yes.

26:57.951 --> 26:58.952
But...

26:59.328 --> 27:00.329
it can't be me.

27:00.913 --> 27:02.331
I could get disbarred for that.

27:03.207 --> 27:05.334
Mr. Reed at Mid City...

27:05.417 --> 27:07.544
He's her banker now, Bernard.

27:08.921 --> 27:10.589
He's not going to intervene for you.

27:15.427 --> 27:16.887
I need to see Mr. Reed.

27:16.970 --> 27:18.388
I'm sorry, Mr. Garrett.

27:18.472 --> 27:20.849
Mr. Reed can't see anybody
without an appointment.

27:20.933 --> 27:21.934
This is urgent.

27:24.353 --> 27:25.395
Hold on a moment.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.947
[no audible dialogue]

28:29.084 --> 28:32.296
I don't know how familiar you are
with the commercial real estate market.

28:32.379 --> 28:35.174
Eunice told me you had two or three
income-producing buildings?

28:36.091 --> 28:37.301
Seventeen.

28:37.384 --> 28:39.636
But once you've popped your cherry,

28:39.720 --> 28:42.222
I mean, how much more
can you learn on each new one?

28:43.807 --> 28:44.850
Seventeen?

28:45.726 --> 28:47.144
Eighteen, if you count the club.

28:47.936 --> 28:49.605
My mother was a real estate agent.

28:50.898 --> 28:51.982
You know this building?

28:54.943 --> 28:57.821
Sure. Bunch of bankers headquarters
in there.

28:57.905 --> 29:00.824
Tallest commercial building
in downtown Los Angeles.

29:00.908 --> 29:01.950
I wanna buy it.

29:04.119 --> 29:05.162
I want us to buy it.

29:08.999 --> 29:13.295
That's a mighty big building to buy
on the most expensive land in the city.

29:13.378 --> 29:14.379
I know.

29:16.215 --> 29:18.217
We'd need a substantial loan.

29:18.300 --> 29:21.053
You don't own all 18 of those properties
outright, do you?

29:23.055 --> 29:27.184
I got a banker in San Francisco
I've done business with for years.

29:28.894 --> 29:29.895
Drink?

29:29.978 --> 29:31.313
No, thank you. I don't drink.

29:37.194 --> 29:42.741
You know there's not a single black-owned
building in downtown Los Angeles.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.326
There's a reason for that.

29:44.409 --> 29:46.703
Yeah. We're probably gonna
have to overpay to get it.

29:46.787 --> 29:49.623
[chuckles]
Tell me something I don't know.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.167
Now...

29:53.669 --> 29:54.711
convince me.

29:57.172 --> 29:58.173
Well...

30:00.008 --> 30:02.928
the best place to learn about the present
state of the real estate market

30:03.011 --> 30:04.429
is inside of a bank.

30:04.513 --> 30:07.224
We get that building,
we'll be inside 12 of them.

30:08.100 --> 30:11.854
And next time they'll think twice about
refusing to make loans to us

30:12.437 --> 30:13.856
if we're their landlords.

30:15.983 --> 30:18.527
That's very audacious, Mr. Garrett.

30:19.194 --> 30:21.154
I think of it in purely logical terms.

30:22.489 --> 30:23.490
What a shame.

30:23.907 --> 30:24.950
Excuse me?

30:25.033 --> 30:28.120
What about the thrill
of taking it to the man?

30:28.203 --> 30:30.455
In his own castle, no less?

30:31.790 --> 30:32.791
No?

30:34.918 --> 30:35.919
Never mind.

30:36.962 --> 30:41.592
But on purely logical terms,
I have a concern about your plan.

30:41.675 --> 30:43.010
What's that?

30:43.552 --> 30:47.347
All this information we'll be getting
from hanging around all these bankers

30:47.431 --> 30:51.268
is gonna be about
property in white neighborhoods.

30:55.314 --> 31:01.195
Do you plan on starting to buy real estate
in white-only neighborhoods, Mr. Garrett?

31:01.987 --> 31:03.655
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

31:03.739 --> 31:06.658
[cackles]

31:08.827 --> 31:12.956
And just how in the hell
do you plan on pulling that off?

31:13.790 --> 31:15.959
The same way we're gonna buy
the Bankers Building.

31:22.382 --> 31:23.800
You want me to what?

31:23.884 --> 31:26.512
Be us to the rest of the world.

31:27.721 --> 31:31.225
I don't know anything about banking.
I don't know how to buy a bank.

31:31.308 --> 31:33.060
[Bernard]
We're not actually buying a bank.

31:33.143 --> 31:35.437
We're buying a building
that the banks are in.

31:35.938 --> 31:37.022
The banks are tenants.

31:38.857 --> 31:39.691
Right.

31:39.775 --> 31:41.610
You'd just be the face of our partnership.

31:42.736 --> 31:45.030
You think I'm,
you know, qualified for this?

31:45.113 --> 31:46.990
We'll teach you everything
you need to know.

31:48.784 --> 31:49.868
Huh.

31:50.744 --> 31:52.955
That guy? Seriously?

31:53.455 --> 31:55.082
He just has to digest it.

31:55.165 --> 31:56.166
So, what?

31:56.250 --> 31:58.627
He can freeze up
soon as we send him in the room?

31:58.710 --> 31:59.753
He won't freeze up.

31:59.837 --> 32:01.505
Trust me. He's the right guy.

32:01.588 --> 32:05.884
I'll lay you a hundred dollars to your one
he can't go the distance.

32:06.301 --> 32:07.928
Don't you know any other white people

32:08.011 --> 32:09.930
who'd like to get paid
to be our front man?

32:10.013 --> 32:11.598
Not that I trust. Do you?

32:11.974 --> 32:13.392
I don't trust white people.

32:14.142 --> 32:15.853
How do you even go through life like that?

32:15.936 --> 32:17.896
Truth be told,
I don't trust black people either.

32:19.106 --> 32:20.440
What are you even saying?

32:20.524 --> 32:23.402
Look. I do plenty of business
with white folks.

32:23.485 --> 32:24.486
I'm friendly with them.

32:24.570 --> 32:26.321
Good friends with some.

32:26.405 --> 32:29.241
I'm just saying that no matter what,

32:29.324 --> 32:33.287
there's always something extra
going on in the relationship.

32:33.370 --> 32:34.830
It's just the way shit is.

32:34.913 --> 32:36.623
When you accept that,

32:36.707 --> 32:40.002
you can't get caught off guard
when it rears its ugly head.

32:40.669 --> 32:42.296
I can't live my life like that.

32:42.796 --> 32:44.339
See, that's what I like about you.

32:45.048 --> 32:46.592
You are a good person.

32:46.675 --> 32:48.802
Ain't been corrupted by the world yet.

32:48.886 --> 32:50.053
Like a child.

32:50.971 --> 32:53.724
But that's gonna change when you get rich.

32:54.725 --> 32:55.934
Yeah, I'll take that risk.

32:56.643 --> 32:58.103
You ain't gonna have no choice.

33:00.105 --> 33:01.982
[pop music playing on speakers]

33:06.028 --> 33:07.112
[plate sets on table]

33:08.238 --> 33:09.323
Thanks.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.502
Hi. [chuckles]

33:22.544 --> 33:23.587
Hi.

33:24.087 --> 33:26.256
Um, you're Matt Steiner, right?

33:29.301 --> 33:30.385
Hollywood High?

33:30.469 --> 33:31.637
- Yes.
- Right.

33:31.720 --> 33:35.557
You were a few years ahead of me,
but everybody knew who you were.

33:36.016 --> 33:37.351
[Susie chuckles]

33:39.144 --> 33:40.854
What are you all sour-faced about?

33:42.606 --> 33:43.607
I was just thinking.

33:44.149 --> 33:45.150
About?

33:45.901 --> 33:46.735
A new job.

33:46.818 --> 33:48.320
Mmm? Doing what?

33:49.238 --> 33:50.322
Real estate.

33:50.697 --> 33:52.533
Oh, like a... like a broker?

33:52.991 --> 33:54.826
You know, more like an investor.

33:54.910 --> 33:55.953
Oh.

33:56.036 --> 33:57.871
Well, I'd be working with the investors.

33:57.955 --> 33:58.789
Hand in hand.

33:58.872 --> 34:00.123
So, they're hiring you?

34:01.750 --> 34:02.793
Kind of a partnership.

34:03.961 --> 34:05.295
A partnership.

34:07.673 --> 34:10.300
- S-Susie.
- Yeah, yeah. Um...

34:10.384 --> 34:12.010
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

34:23.021 --> 34:24.022
I'm in.

34:25.065 --> 34:26.065
You sure?

34:26.149 --> 34:28.569
Just teach me what I need to know.
I won't let you down.

34:31.154 --> 34:34.116
Be at Rancho Park Golf Course
tomorrow morning, 6:00 a.m.

34:34.574 --> 34:35.617
Don't be late.

34:35.701 --> 34:36.702
Thank you.

34:38.203 --> 34:39.246
Thanks.

34:47.337 --> 34:50.799
[yawning]

34:53.969 --> 34:55.094
What? Is he even coming?

34:55.179 --> 34:56.179
[grunts]

34:57.264 --> 34:58.515
Morning, fellows.

34:58.599 --> 34:59.808
I thought you said 6:00?

34:59.892 --> 35:02.227
- I did. Were you here at 6:00?
- Yeah.

35:02.311 --> 35:03.312
Good.

35:03.896 --> 35:04.938
You ever play golf?

35:05.397 --> 35:06.607
No.

35:06.690 --> 35:08.817
Well, before you learn
how to talk real estate,

35:08.901 --> 35:10.903
you gotta learn
how to talk to rich white folks

35:10.986 --> 35:12.654
so it seems like you one of 'em.

35:12.738 --> 35:16.200
And you got one month
to learn how to play golf.

35:16.283 --> 35:18.678
And I mean learn to play
like you've been playing your whole life.

35:18.702 --> 35:19.786
Think you can do that?

35:20.579 --> 35:22.706
Yeah. I played
a lot of sports as a kid. So...

35:22.789 --> 35:24.917
So... yes?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.627
- Yes.
- All right, then.

35:27.044 --> 35:28.754
Take him over and get him outfitted.

35:28.837 --> 35:31.006
Show him the basics
and I'll take over from there.

35:31.089 --> 35:32.090
Follow me.

35:38.138 --> 35:39.574
[Bernard]
So a hundred dollars to my one?

35:39.598 --> 35:43.602
You think it's a done deal because,
what, I'm such a good golf teacher?

35:43.685 --> 35:45.938
You can fake math.
You can't fake a golf game.

35:46.021 --> 35:47.341
[man] He's right about that, Joe.

35:48.440 --> 35:51.652
Bernard, this is Don Silverthorne.
My banker.

35:51.735 --> 35:53.570
Flew all the way down
from San Francisco

35:53.654 --> 35:54.988
just to see how crazy we are.

35:55.072 --> 35:56.073
[Don] Nice to meet you.

35:59.159 --> 36:00.244
[Matt] Shit!

36:00.327 --> 36:02.079
Well, it looks like I got my answer.

36:02.162 --> 36:03.956
Uh, let's try that again.

36:04.039 --> 36:05.624
All right. What do I do differently?

36:05.707 --> 36:06.708
Swing lower.

36:07.292 --> 36:09.127
- Great, thanks.
- Keep your head still.

36:09.586 --> 36:11.106
[whispering] Head still, head still...

36:14.007 --> 36:15.133
No, you moved.

36:15.801 --> 36:18.679
If this charade's gonna work
and you guys want me to finance,

36:18.762 --> 36:21.431
I just hope you don't offer
over two million for that building.

36:22.015 --> 36:23.559
More than that, I don't want the risk.

36:24.601 --> 36:26.770
I can get that building
for under two million.

36:26.854 --> 36:28.730
It's not you I'm worried about,
Mr. Garrett.

36:29.857 --> 36:30.858
I hit it.

36:32.442 --> 36:33.443
It's him.

36:34.069 --> 36:36.196
You sure you don't wanna give me
that dollar now?

36:38.657 --> 36:40.337
[Bernard]
The old way of valuing a building

36:40.367 --> 36:43.704
is the number of years rent it takes
to pay off the price of a building.

36:44.246 --> 36:46.206
So, if the building costs $300,000

36:46.290 --> 36:50.169
and you're getting $30,000 net income
per year, it's a ten multiple.

36:50.252 --> 36:53.839
Today most people value buildings
using the capitalization rate.

36:54.256 --> 36:55.883
But they're mathematically related.

36:56.717 --> 36:59.595
So the cap rate
is the multiplicative inverse

36:59.678 --> 37:01.847
of the ten multiple
we were just talking about.

37:03.015 --> 37:06.602
300,000 = 30,000 x M.

37:06.685 --> 37:10.939
M = ten years.

37:11.023 --> 37:15.194
One-tenth x 300,000 = 30,000.

37:17.237 --> 37:20.365
One-tenth is 10%.

37:21.617 --> 37:22.618
Your cap rate.

37:25.204 --> 37:26.496
[grunts]

37:26.580 --> 37:28.624
Maybe we should start with a math review.

37:29.833 --> 37:30.918
That'd be great.

37:41.845 --> 37:43.764
- Right?
- You have to carry the four.

37:44.723 --> 37:45.724
Which four?

37:55.734 --> 37:59.404
Even on a putt, keep your f-ing head down.

37:59.488 --> 38:00.989
Keep my f-ing head down. Keep...

38:07.287 --> 38:10.082
There's a subtraction error in there
and that last step is wrong.

38:10.165 --> 38:13.418
But other than that
you're getting the gist of it.

38:15.879 --> 38:16.880
Sorry.

38:16.964 --> 38:17.965
Sorry.

38:18.048 --> 38:19.049
Sorry!

38:25.764 --> 38:26.765
Right.

38:26.849 --> 38:29.142
Now multiply by 1.25.

38:29.893 --> 38:31.478
1.25...

38:32.938 --> 38:35.607
No. No, no, no. Stop! Stop!

38:35.691 --> 38:36.733
[groans]

38:36.817 --> 38:39.027
[Joe laughing]

38:39.820 --> 38:41.029
No, no, no.

38:41.655 --> 38:42.781
Stop laughing.

38:44.825 --> 38:46.285
[Joe] What the hell?

38:46.368 --> 38:47.828
[laughing continues]

38:47.911 --> 38:49.037
Hit it.

38:49.121 --> 38:50.205
I am hitting it!

38:51.456 --> 38:52.541
Oh!

38:52.624 --> 38:53.834
[groans]

38:56.170 --> 38:57.713
Careful now. Don't hurt yourself.

39:00.007 --> 39:01.175
Stop. Just stop.

39:04.011 --> 39:07.681
We're about 50 yards from the green,
so we're gonna use a wedge.

39:08.682 --> 39:09.892
[Matt sighs]

39:14.396 --> 39:17.608
And you wanna swing it 'bout this hard.

39:22.279 --> 39:25.115
Remember, it's a wedge,
so don't be scared to swing it.

39:25.199 --> 39:26.366
What else you gonna do?

39:26.450 --> 39:27.910
Keep my f-ing head down.

39:27.993 --> 39:29.203
[softly] Jesus. Come on.

39:40.797 --> 39:41.798
It's right...

39:45.385 --> 39:48.555
- Oh!
- Holy shit. Oh, my...

39:48.639 --> 39:49.640
Come on.

39:50.474 --> 39:52.851
- I just kept my f-ing head down and...
- Whoo!

40:00.484 --> 40:03.862
Uh, it's 432,000.

40:06.782 --> 40:08.325
[no audible dialogue]

40:08.408 --> 40:10.118
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

40:10.202 --> 40:11.882
You got it right, man.
You're getting this.

40:19.336 --> 40:20.462
[no audible dialogue]

41:13.515 --> 41:14.766
What you want, Bernard?

41:14.850 --> 41:15.976
This is my time.

41:17.394 --> 41:18.714
[Bernard] I wanna buy a building.

41:20.397 --> 41:24.902
It has a $100,000 annual gross income,
8% vacancy rate,

41:25.485 --> 41:30.490
$12,000 annual operating costs
and I require a 10% cap rate.

41:32.576 --> 41:34.786
What's the maximum purchase amount
I can offer?

41:41.710 --> 41:42.753
Where'd that go?

41:44.379 --> 41:47.966
Straight down the middle, 'bout, oh...

41:49.218 --> 41:52.387
Shit, I don't even know.
I ain't never hit a ball that far.

41:52.471 --> 41:53.639
It's 800,000.

41:56.725 --> 41:58.227
- He's right.
- You're right.

41:58.310 --> 41:59.561
- He's right?
- Yeah.

42:00.771 --> 42:02.564
We have created a monster.

42:02.648 --> 42:03.815
You made the algebra easy.

42:03.899 --> 42:06.151
A month ago, you didn't know
what algebra was, Matt.

42:06.235 --> 42:07.945
- That's true.
- You have a knack for it.

42:12.699 --> 42:13.742
He's ready.

42:14.493 --> 42:16.620
Yep. He's ready.

42:17.955 --> 42:21.250
[Bernard] The Bankers Building is owned
by Charles Renault.

42:22.209 --> 42:23.919
It's 14 stories.

42:24.002 --> 42:27.464
119,000 square feet of commercial space.

42:28.549 --> 42:30.342
It was built in 1929.

42:30.425 --> 42:33.720
And it's still the tallest
commercial building downtown

42:33.804 --> 42:37.140
<i>and generally considered the crown jewel
of downtown architecture.</i>

42:41.353 --> 42:42.729
That's his office?

42:42.813 --> 42:44.898
- That's his office.
- [door closes]

42:44.982 --> 42:46.900
<i>A converted ballroom.</i>

42:47.693 --> 42:49.945
[Matt] <i>Holy shit. How rich is this guy?</i>

42:50.028 --> 42:51.113
[Joe] <i>Very.</i>

42:51.613 --> 42:54.950
<i>Now, he won't take you seriously
without a proper introduction.</i>

42:55.033 --> 43:00.455
But I have arranged for you to bump
into him at the Hancock Park country club.

43:01.415 --> 43:03.750
Wait, that's the most exclusive club
in the city.

43:03.834 --> 43:05.043
I can't just walk in.

43:05.127 --> 43:06.211
Don't worry about that.

43:14.261 --> 43:16.346
[men chattering]

43:22.477 --> 43:24.271
Mr. Steiner, welcome.

43:24.354 --> 43:25.355
Thank you.

43:25.439 --> 43:28.317
Arrangements have been made
for you to use our club as a guest,

43:28.400 --> 43:31.236
per our exchange program
with your home club in Pennsylvania.

43:31.862 --> 43:34.198
Will your chauffeur be
waiting on the premises?

43:36.408 --> 43:37.951
I'll be just outside the gate.

43:38.577 --> 43:40.537
Anything goes south, you come find me.

43:41.371 --> 43:43.040
That won't happen, Mr. Morris.

43:44.791 --> 43:45.918
I promise.

43:46.001 --> 43:47.002
Thank you, Anton.

43:50.797 --> 43:52.716
- I'm worried.
- About what?

43:52.799 --> 43:54.843
I don't always do great under pressure.

43:54.927 --> 43:57.221
[chuckles] Come on. You're a natural.

43:57.304 --> 43:59.473
- Natural what?
- Performer.

44:00.432 --> 44:01.517
How do you know that?

44:01.600 --> 44:04.686
You think I got where I am in life
without being able to spot talent?

44:07.606 --> 44:08.607
Go get him.

44:09.858 --> 44:10.901
Yes, sir.

44:20.244 --> 44:21.286
Mr. Steiner?

44:21.995 --> 44:22.996
Yes?

44:23.080 --> 44:25.558
Jackie says you're playing as a single,
looking to be paired up.

44:25.582 --> 44:27.042
Always looking for a good game.

44:27.793 --> 44:29.670
If I can find someone to give me one.

44:29.753 --> 44:31.255
Charles Renault, good to meet you.

44:33.215 --> 44:34.675
Enjoying playing dress-up?

44:34.758 --> 44:36.844
You should try it sometime.
It's thrilling.

44:36.927 --> 44:38.846
[chuckles] No, thanks.

44:38.929 --> 44:42.182
Oh. So, you're okay with having
a white boy do your business for you,

44:42.266 --> 44:43.934
but you're not okay putting on a cap

44:44.017 --> 44:46.019
so you can keep an eye on him
while he does it?

44:46.562 --> 44:49.356
It's the only job I've been able to avoid
my entire life.

44:49.898 --> 44:52.484
- I'd like to try and keep it that way.
- [laughs]

45:03.912 --> 45:05.122
[Renault chuckles]

45:05.539 --> 45:07.416
Jimmy, I think we got ourselves a game.

45:09.168 --> 45:10.210
Okay.

45:10.961 --> 45:12.504
So, we're really gonna do this now?

45:12.588 --> 45:16.133
If by "we," you mean "you," yeah.

45:38.155 --> 45:39.198
Remember,

45:40.157 --> 45:41.283
eyes on the ball.

45:41.366 --> 45:42.618
And keep my f-ing head down.

45:46.914 --> 45:48.040
Make me proud, son.

45:57.299 --> 46:00.052
He's gonna claim he's renting
for 20 cents a square foot,

46:00.135 --> 46:01.136
but that's poppycock.

46:01.220 --> 46:02.221
It's more like 15.

46:04.598 --> 46:06.975
[Bernard]
<i>See, this whole thing is about getting you</i>

46:07.059 --> 46:08.894
<i>to agree to a higher base value.</i>

46:08.977 --> 46:10.521
Uh... Which I won't do.

46:10.604 --> 46:12.940
He's gonna test you. Probe you.

46:21.573 --> 46:25.661
You give him the slightest reason
to doubt your command of the numbers,

46:25.744 --> 46:27.579
he'll see straight through you.

46:27.663 --> 46:28.789
So you gotta impress him.

46:29.831 --> 46:31.166
<i>Like you did on the first tee.</i>

46:32.209 --> 46:33.210
Okay, so what do I do?

46:33.293 --> 46:36.755
What's the equivalent
of a 300-yard tee shot in negotiation?

46:39.007 --> 46:40.217
A four-course lunch.

46:46.598 --> 46:48.016
[chattering]

46:48.642 --> 46:50.394
flown in from France once a week.

46:51.478 --> 46:52.479
Enjoy.

46:58.110 --> 47:00.445
Okay, we lease at 20 cents a square foot.

47:00.529 --> 47:03.740
That's 272,880 gross per year.

47:03.824 --> 47:05.409
Eighty thousand expenses.

47:05.492 --> 47:07.369
That's 192,880 in profit.

47:08.036 --> 47:12.165
10% cap rate on that
will get us to 1,928,880.

47:12.666 --> 47:17.087
25% premium on that would be 2,411,100.

47:18.672 --> 47:21.008
If that's what you're offering,
I'm interested.

47:24.261 --> 47:25.470
Here's my problem, Charles.

47:25.554 --> 47:28.098
I know you have leases
at 15 cents a square foot.

47:28.182 --> 47:29.641
You know, big long-term leases.

47:29.725 --> 47:31.661
So even if you have
a few suckers paying 20 cents...

47:31.685 --> 47:32.769
More than a few.

47:34.062 --> 47:35.689
Fine, call the average 18 cents,

47:35.772 --> 47:37.524
so that would be a net income of...

47:37.608 --> 47:41.153
245,592. But that's not important.

47:41.236 --> 47:44.114
I mean, if you wanna show me your leases
and prove it, okay.

47:44.198 --> 47:46.283
Otherwise, I'd call it
15 cents a square foot.

47:46.366 --> 47:48.160
- Fifteen is too low.
- Fifteen is generous.

47:48.243 --> 47:51.038
Especially when you factor in vacancies,
which are at least 9%.

47:51.121 --> 47:52.915
- Less than that.
- I counted 12.

47:52.998 --> 47:54.708
How could you possibly know that?

47:55.501 --> 47:56.793
Charles, it's November.

47:57.669 --> 47:59.254
<i>It gets dark by 5:00 p.m.</i>

48:02.049 --> 48:04.110
<i>If you wanna bullshit someone
about your vacancy rate,</i>

48:04.134 --> 48:06.970
you need lights shining
in all those unleased spaces by 4:30.

48:07.513 --> 48:09.890
I don't blame you for not doing it.
It's a lot of work.

48:09.973 --> 48:12.368
But those vacancies would
take you to 13.5 cents a square foot.

48:12.392 --> 48:13.477
We'll fill some of those.

48:13.560 --> 48:15.604
Let's call it 16 cents. Fair?

48:16.271 --> 48:21.610
That's a $1,383,000 valuation
at a 10% cap rate.

48:22.611 --> 48:25.364
But, of course a 10% cap rate
is too low for this market.

48:25.447 --> 48:28.116
My partners and I have multiple deals
with 12% returns,

48:28.867 --> 48:30.244
which would be...

48:30.327 --> 48:36.083
$1,152,533 underlying valuation.

48:37.835 --> 48:42.464
- 1,152,533.
- [mouthing words]

48:44.383 --> 48:46.009
How do you do this in your head?

48:46.677 --> 48:48.762
There's no way I can do this math.

48:49.972 --> 48:52.391
Well, you know, maybe I could fake it?

48:53.141 --> 48:54.142
How?

48:56.311 --> 48:57.646
Practice.

48:57.729 --> 48:58.814
I'll just memorize it.

49:00.858 --> 49:02.359
- All of it?
- Mm-hmm.

49:03.068 --> 49:04.528
Yeah, I got a pretty good memory.

49:05.112 --> 49:06.572
[chuckles] That good?

49:06.655 --> 49:08.365
Well, I got a week to learn it, right?

49:08.448 --> 49:09.448
[Joe laughs]

49:09.783 --> 49:11.243
Hustling a hustler.

49:11.326 --> 49:12.578
I love it.

49:13.787 --> 49:15.038
But, if this works,

49:15.706 --> 49:17.666
Renault's gonna challenge you
on the cap rate.

49:17.749 --> 49:19.793
So you need to get ready for it.

49:20.752 --> 49:23.046
Look, this is downtown.
The risk here is very low.

49:23.672 --> 49:25.257
It doesn't warrant a 12% return.

49:25.799 --> 49:27.509
I'm firm with a 10% cap rate.

49:28.010 --> 49:31.513
He's gonna try to hold you
to a 10% cap rate on the underlying value,

49:31.597 --> 49:33.098
which we're not gonna take.

49:33.599 --> 49:36.018
Not with a 25% premium going to him.

49:36.101 --> 49:38.478
But you're gonna need
somewhere to go in the conversation.

49:38.562 --> 49:42.024
So I want you to memorize
the 10.5% cap rate scenario as well.

49:42.107 --> 49:48.447
But a 25% premium on a 10.5% cap rate
is too high, right?

49:52.201 --> 49:57.331
10.5% cap rate means
$1,317,000 underlying.

49:57.414 --> 50:02.669
With the 25% premium, that's $1,646,250.

50:03.462 --> 50:04.546
Too high.

50:04.630 --> 50:06.715
Yeah, that sounds too high.

50:06.798 --> 50:09.593
[slurring words]
You goddamn right it's too high.

50:11.887 --> 50:13.722
So maybe you can sell him a choice.

50:15.891 --> 50:17.267
Mr. Renault, I like you.

50:17.768 --> 50:20.521
First halfway decent golf game I've had
since I've moved here.

50:20.604 --> 50:24.441
But if you want us to value this building
at a 10% cap rate in a booming market,

50:24.525 --> 50:26.276
where we can get 12% elsewhere,

50:26.818 --> 50:29.821
we're not gonna give you
an instant 25% profit in the markup.

50:31.073 --> 50:32.074
Tell you what.

50:32.950 --> 50:34.201
I'll give you two options.

50:35.118 --> 50:40.415
We get an 11% capital return rate
and you get your 25% profit in the markup,

50:40.499 --> 50:46.755
or we get a 10.5% cap rate and you take
an 18% instead of a 25% markup.

50:47.214 --> 50:49.341
You can choose. But...

50:50.259 --> 50:51.552
he can't help you.

50:56.515 --> 50:58.475
You're not what I expected, Matt Steiner.

51:01.645 --> 51:02.729
I'll take the latter.

51:03.397 --> 51:04.398
Okay.

51:05.274 --> 51:06.316
How'd I do?

51:07.943 --> 51:09.611
You left 17,000 on the table.

51:09.695 --> 51:11.113
[both chuckling]

51:11.196 --> 51:12.447
Oh, well.

51:12.531 --> 51:16.493
- What's the number?
- $1,554,060.

51:16.577 --> 51:21.540
But, we can call it an even 1,560,000
if you leave me that desk.

51:23.584 --> 51:25.919
[all laughing]

51:26.003 --> 51:27.337
I can't believe it worked.

51:28.005 --> 51:28.881
I can.

51:28.964 --> 51:30.716
Tomorrow we meet the tenants,

51:30.799 --> 51:33.719
introduce ourselves as Matt's partners,

51:33.802 --> 51:37.055
and watch the jaws drop.

51:41.059 --> 51:44.271
Maybe I should call a photographer
so you capture the moment.

51:44.354 --> 51:45.856
- Joe.
- What?

51:46.440 --> 51:47.733
Oh. Too much?

51:47.816 --> 51:49.693
Yeah. Cheers.

52:10.047 --> 52:11.798
[phone rings]

52:12.257 --> 52:13.926
[no audible dialogue]

52:17.596 --> 52:19.056
Hello.

52:52.589 --> 52:54.591
[no audible dialogue]

53:13.026 --> 53:14.820
[indistinct]

53:18.156 --> 53:19.157
[photographer] Smile.

53:29.585 --> 53:30.919
[no audible dialogue]

54:38.612 --> 54:41.448
[laughing]

54:43.742 --> 54:45.160
[Eunice squeals]

54:46.203 --> 54:47.871
[Eunice] Hi, Pop.

54:47.955 --> 54:50.082
[father] Oh. How you doing?

54:50.165 --> 54:52.292
And who's this right here?
Who's this right here?

54:52.376 --> 54:53.418
Hey, Grandpa.

54:56.588 --> 54:57.589
Dad.

54:58.674 --> 55:00.592
[all laughing]

55:01.677 --> 55:04.096
[clicks tongue, sighs]

55:04.179 --> 55:06.324
- Here, get some of these sweet potatoes.
- No, thank you.

55:06.348 --> 55:08.684
What kind of growing boy
don't like sweet potato mash?

55:08.767 --> 55:10.727
Oh, sweetie, try 'em. They're delicious.

55:10.811 --> 55:12.187
Daddy met the vice president.

55:12.855 --> 55:14.189
[father] Really now?

55:14.273 --> 55:16.692
Yes, he did. Bernard is being modest.

55:18.068 --> 55:19.194
LBJ?

55:19.611 --> 55:22.155
Yes, sir. He came by the Bankers Building.

55:23.365 --> 55:24.449
Yes, son.

55:29.997 --> 55:31.540
Smooth. Very smooth.

55:32.207 --> 55:33.458
Thought you didn't smoke.

55:33.542 --> 55:34.543
No. I don't.

55:35.043 --> 55:36.545
But I know you like 'em, so...

55:37.045 --> 55:38.964
These are a lot nicer than what I smoke.

55:42.176 --> 55:44.761
You doing so well
out there in Los Angeles.

55:45.762 --> 55:46.889
Guess you were right.

55:47.556 --> 55:48.557
About what?

55:48.974 --> 55:50.934
Earning money the way white men do.

55:51.393 --> 55:53.312
Found you a place where you could do that.

55:54.313 --> 55:57.316
Still... no chance of doing that here.

55:57.816 --> 55:59.193
It might even be worse.

55:59.276 --> 56:02.279
No, it's not perfect in California, but...

56:03.572 --> 56:04.573
it is different.

56:05.490 --> 56:09.286
I don't... I don't think it's California.

56:12.164 --> 56:13.415
I'm proud of you, son.

56:28.764 --> 56:29.848
[Eunice] Where you going?

56:30.390 --> 56:31.683
Taking a walk through town.

56:34.436 --> 56:35.521
Dressed like that?

56:36.647 --> 56:38.690
Going on the other side of the tracks.

56:39.358 --> 56:40.609
Mmm.

56:40.692 --> 56:42.194
You make sure you wear your tie.

56:43.445 --> 56:44.446
I planned on it.

56:48.075 --> 56:49.243
Take Junior with you.

56:51.578 --> 56:53.789
He needs to see where he comes from
up close.

56:57.751 --> 56:59.920
["A Childhood" by Ray Charles playing]

57:27.239 --> 57:29.783
[continues]

57:44.214 --> 57:45.841
Why the fountains separated, Dad?

57:47.467 --> 57:48.927
[sighs]

57:49.011 --> 57:50.637
It's just different down here, son.

57:51.597 --> 57:52.598
[Bernard Jr.] Yeah.

57:53.307 --> 57:54.683
I'm sorry you had to see that.

57:55.893 --> 57:56.894
It's okay.

57:57.811 --> 57:59.271
Hey, how much for a shine?

57:59.354 --> 58:00.856
Only do white folks here, sir.

58:14.912 --> 58:16.392
[Bernard]
<i>You think this is a mistake?</i>

58:17.664 --> 58:19.374
I think the world is changing.

58:19.458 --> 58:20.667
Mmm.

58:21.251 --> 58:23.629
But maybe it hasn't changed enough
in Texas.

58:27.174 --> 58:28.675
I feel like I have to do this.

58:31.220 --> 58:32.346
I know.

58:33.347 --> 58:35.098
And that is why I support you.

58:37.851 --> 58:39.645
What the hell do we know about banking?

58:40.145 --> 58:43.690
Banks take deposits and make loans,
mostly on property.

58:44.358 --> 58:47.819
Owning a bank is like owning the other
side of the real estate business.

58:47.903 --> 58:51.114
I'm pretty sure there's a few complexities
you just left out.

58:51.740 --> 58:56.328
Like we black,
and this goddamn bank is in Texas.

58:56.411 --> 58:59.289
There's no Texas law
that says we can't own a bank.

58:59.373 --> 59:02.960
I concede, us being black
may be an issue, practically speaking.

59:03.043 --> 59:04.837
You willing to concede that?

59:04.920 --> 59:06.547
Well, we get Matt to front for us.

59:06.630 --> 59:07.714
No shit.

59:07.798 --> 59:10.300
But here in LA
Matt unlocks the doors for us,

59:10.384 --> 59:12.052
he don't run the business day-to-day,

59:12.135 --> 59:15.097
much less a banking business,
which is not simple.

59:15.180 --> 59:16.765
We'd have to monitor things closely.

59:16.849 --> 59:18.559
And how the hell you plan to do that?

59:18.642 --> 59:21.311
We can't set foot in a bank in Texas
unless we're the help.

59:21.395 --> 59:23.605
[chuckles] I thought that would be
your favorite part.

59:23.689 --> 59:24.940
I live in LA.

59:25.023 --> 59:27.442
I don't plan on moving to Texas. Do you?

59:27.526 --> 59:28.861
During the business week.

59:28.944 --> 59:31.822
And work as a janitor in a bank you own?

59:31.905 --> 59:32.906
Won't have to.

59:32.990 --> 59:35.868
Matt comes to me with the bank business
at the end of every day.

59:35.951 --> 59:39.037
What makes you think he's willing to move
to the middle of nowhere?

59:39.121 --> 59:41.915
No offense to your cosmopolitan hometown.

59:42.374 --> 59:46.044
Plus Matt's got a pretty good gig here.

59:46.128 --> 59:47.671
We'd have to make it worth his while.

59:47.754 --> 59:51.592
Great, so now we gonna pay him even more
money than we pay him to be white.

59:52.551 --> 59:56.138
Joe, think about all the good we can do
for the Negro community down there.

59:56.555 --> 59:58.390
Help 'em buy homes, start businesses.

59:59.558 --> 01:00:02.853
And aside from all that,
that bank is undervalued.

01:00:04.188 --> 01:00:07.149
There's enough capital
to double its loan base.

01:00:07.608 --> 01:00:08.901
We could make a lot of money.

01:00:08.984 --> 01:00:10.694
We make a lot of money now.

01:00:11.445 --> 01:00:13.322
You gonna stand there with a straight face

01:00:13.405 --> 01:00:16.408
and tell me there's a business argument
to do this?

01:00:16.491 --> 01:00:18.660
This is social activism, Bernard.

01:00:18.744 --> 01:00:19.745
Plain and simple.

01:00:20.162 --> 01:00:22.039
There's plenty other ways to do that.

01:00:22.956 --> 01:00:26.084
Or maybe you're feeling guilty about
leaving your father behind.

01:00:26.168 --> 01:00:27.169
Let me tell you this.

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:31.757
If one trip home can
cripple your rational functions like this,

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.841
we in trouble.

01:00:34.384 --> 01:00:35.636
With all due respect, Joe,

01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:37.763
I think this is something
you won't understand.

01:00:37.846 --> 01:00:38.847
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:40.641
Did I not wake up black this morning?

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:42.226
'Cause I'm pretty sure I did.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:44.269
Yep, still black.

01:00:44.353 --> 01:00:48.607
Are you telling me because I grew up
in California with a little bit of money,

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:50.400
I'm not black in your eyes?

01:00:50.776 --> 01:00:52.486
I wasn't trying to make this personal.

01:00:54.363 --> 01:00:55.405
Yes, you were.

01:00:59.618 --> 01:01:00.661
I'm sorry.

01:01:04.081 --> 01:01:06.458
Bernard, if we go down to Texas

01:01:06.542 --> 01:01:09.127
and start screwing around with Jim Crow,
we gonna lose.

01:01:09.211 --> 01:01:10.921
Don't matter whether it's legal or not.

01:01:11.421 --> 01:01:14.216
Even if Dr. King
gets civil rights legislation,

01:01:14.299 --> 01:01:15.759
it ain't gonna happen fast enough

01:01:15.843 --> 01:01:18.303
for us to get out of this
without losing our shirts.

01:01:21.265 --> 01:01:22.599
Bring your father out here.

01:01:22.683 --> 01:01:24.017
Help him directly.

01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:27.437
And get rid of that notion that you can
save every black man in Texas,

01:01:27.521 --> 01:01:28.772
'cause you can't.

01:01:29.982 --> 01:01:32.401
I understand if you don't want to
partner with me on it.

01:01:33.485 --> 01:01:35.612
You can't buy this bank
on your own, Bernard.

01:01:35.696 --> 01:01:36.697
Not at that price.

01:01:37.114 --> 01:01:39.116
Then I'll find someone else
to do it with me.

01:01:42.119 --> 01:01:43.662
Jesus H. Christ.

01:01:45.706 --> 01:01:48.166
I told you getting rich
was going to change you.

01:01:51.128 --> 01:01:55.257
Mark my words. This is a bad idea.

01:01:56.133 --> 01:01:59.928
But it's even more bodacious
than us buying that Bankers Building.

01:02:00.387 --> 01:02:02.389
And we sure enough pulled that off,
didn't we?

01:02:05.934 --> 01:02:07.519
All right. I'm in.

01:02:09.479 --> 01:02:10.522
Shit.

01:02:19.573 --> 01:02:23.619
For the record I say you guys are out of
your minds, completely out of your minds.

01:02:23.702 --> 01:02:24.703
You ready?

01:02:25.245 --> 01:02:26.288
I...

01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:28.707
Could you tell me how a bank works
in three sentences?

01:02:30.959 --> 01:02:34.129
A bakery makes a profit by selling bread
for more than it cost to make.

01:02:34.755 --> 01:02:35.756
A bank makes a profit

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:39.676
by selling loans for more than it costs to
get the money needed to make those loans.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.763
Basically, a bank gets money
from depositors at 3%

01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:43.972
and loans it out at five.

01:02:44.056 --> 01:02:46.725
Wow. That actually was three sentences.

01:02:48.977 --> 01:02:49.978
Let's go.

01:02:51.146 --> 01:02:52.189
This should be fun.

01:02:53.106 --> 01:02:54.292
[Joe] You gonna put the hat on?

01:02:54.316 --> 01:02:55.317
I'll pass.

01:02:55.776 --> 01:02:56.777
All righty then.

01:02:57.361 --> 01:02:58.487
Shall we?

01:03:07.788 --> 01:03:10.290
Gentlemen, Don Silverthorne.

01:03:11.333 --> 01:03:12.519
- Robert Florance.
- Matt Steiner.

01:03:12.543 --> 01:03:13.544
Robert Florance Jr.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.606
- [teller] Next.
- [Robert Sr.] Please, gentlemen, come in.

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:17.714
[Don] Thank you.

01:03:19.508 --> 01:03:21.301
Yes, of course. Gentlemen.

01:03:24.805 --> 01:03:28.600
My son's guaranteed a position
to protect my remaining 20% interest?

01:03:28.684 --> 01:03:29.828
You'll see that in the addendum.

01:03:29.852 --> 01:03:32.479
But he won't be the bank's
exclusive loan officer any longer.

01:03:32.563 --> 01:03:35.941
My clients' primary interest in buying
the bank is to increase the loan volume

01:03:36.024 --> 01:03:37.818
and thus the profitability of the bank.

01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:41.280
He'll be reporting directly to you
as the new bank president, Mr. Steiner?

01:03:41.363 --> 01:03:42.364
That's right.

01:03:44.366 --> 01:03:47.327
Who are Bernard Garrett and Joseph Morris?

01:03:48.328 --> 01:03:49.955
My financial partners in Los Angeles.

01:04:05.721 --> 01:04:07.055
[inaudible]

01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:10.225
Why aren't they here?

01:04:10.601 --> 01:04:13.520
Honestly? Because they're
too rich to bother.

01:04:13.604 --> 01:04:15.022
That's why they have me.

01:04:15.105 --> 01:04:17.792
No offense, but they have hundreds
of these investments across the country.

01:04:17.816 --> 01:04:19.193
Well, that's great for them.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.070
But this is the investment
they're closing today.

01:04:40.797 --> 01:04:43.550
I should note that
the full purchase price for the bank

01:04:43.634 --> 01:04:46.803
is sitting in escrow in my bank
as of 11:00 a.m. this morning.

01:04:46.887 --> 01:04:48.764
Which is all that matters.

01:04:59.358 --> 01:05:03.779
Congratulations, you are now
the owner of your hometown bank.

01:05:04.988 --> 01:05:07.115
Time to get my black ass back to LA.

01:05:09.576 --> 01:05:10.661
Don't ask.

01:05:11.995 --> 01:05:14.039
[engine starts]

01:05:15.415 --> 01:05:18.126
My partners and I now own Mainland Bank.

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:23.257
And we intend to change the bank's
policies regarding loans to Negroes.

01:05:24.383 --> 01:05:26.301
<i>But we need your help to identify</i>

01:05:26.385 --> 01:05:29.513
<i>responsible potential borrowers
in your congregations.</i>

01:05:30.138 --> 01:05:32.641
You get the loan...

01:05:32.724 --> 01:05:36.186
<i>Now, it goes without saying that we cannot
draw attention to this new policy</i>

01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:38.772
<i>or to our ownership of the bank.</i>

01:05:40.274 --> 01:05:43.819
<i>Or everything we're trying to do
will be put in jeopardy.</i>

01:05:45.362 --> 01:05:49.783
<i>But make no mistake,
our goal is to foster business growth</i>

01:05:49.867 --> 01:05:54.413
{\an8}<i>and home ownership in our community
through access to capital.</i>

01:05:55.163 --> 01:05:58.166
Thanks to your loan,
we bought two new pieces of equipment.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:00.127
Doubled our revenue in three months.

01:06:08.135 --> 01:06:11.013
You approved 14 new loans this week?

01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:13.182
That sounds right.

01:06:13.599 --> 01:06:15.100
Only five of those were mine.

01:06:16.894 --> 01:06:19.229
There's a lot of underutilized capital
in this bank.

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:22.709
You knew I was gonna start signing off
on loans directly to jump-start things.

01:06:22.733 --> 01:06:24.711
I haven't seen
that many viable applicants in one week

01:06:24.735 --> 01:06:26.111
since I've worked at this bank.

01:06:26.653 --> 01:06:28.822
I've been working here
since I was 18 years old.

01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:31.241
Where are you finding all these people?

01:06:32.034 --> 01:06:34.620
Who's "Solomon Johnson"?

01:06:36.455 --> 01:06:37.748
We're casting a wide net.

01:06:38.332 --> 01:06:40.459
The more loans we make,
the higher our profit.

01:06:41.084 --> 01:06:42.252
Goes for your stake too.

01:06:42.794 --> 01:06:44.129
As long as they don't default.

01:06:45.547 --> 01:06:46.840
That's what collateral's for.

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:26.380
My partner Joe comes in town
every other week from LA.

01:07:26.839 --> 01:07:28.066
He's looking forward to meeting you.

01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:30.217
I told him this is
the best barbecue around here.

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.134
Thank you.

01:07:31.218 --> 01:07:33.887
Look, the books I keep are pretty simple.

01:07:34.429 --> 01:07:36.849
But I can go back to the office
and bring 'em out.

01:07:36.932 --> 01:07:37.933
You can look 'em over.

01:07:38.016 --> 01:07:39.726
- That would be great. Thank you.
- Okay.

01:07:44.147 --> 01:07:45.232
You're late.

01:07:46.316 --> 01:07:47.901
Florance discovered the black loans.

01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:52.406
He's been wary of me from the beginning,
now he's watching me like a hawk.

01:07:52.906 --> 01:07:53.907
Any reason why?

01:07:53.991 --> 01:07:55.868
Well, yeah, he had dreams
of being the boss,

01:07:55.951 --> 01:07:58.912
not reporting to some guy from California
ten years younger than him.

01:08:01.456 --> 01:08:03.667
[camera shutter clicking]

01:08:32.362 --> 01:08:33.738
[Susie sighs]

01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:38.118
Uh...

01:08:38.785 --> 01:08:39.786
I hate it here.

01:08:42.997 --> 01:08:45.626
Come on.
We've only been here three months.

01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:46.835
It's enough time to know.

01:08:49.505 --> 01:08:51.173
Why did you agree to do this?

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.634
I'm making 25,000 a year.

01:08:53.716 --> 01:08:56.178
We bought this house
with one month's salary.

01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:59.031
When you started with them you said
they were gonna make you a partner.

01:08:59.055 --> 01:09:01.225
- Yeah, and...
- A partner isn't on a salary.

01:09:01.308 --> 01:09:02.434
A partner is an owner.

01:09:03.268 --> 01:09:05.520
Isn't that what you always told me
you wanted to be?

01:09:05.604 --> 01:09:07.314
And I will be.

01:09:08.814 --> 01:09:10.317
You know, on the next bank we buy.

01:09:13.153 --> 01:09:14.446
You're buying another one?

01:09:16.657 --> 01:09:18.033
We're thinking about it, yeah.

01:09:20.035 --> 01:09:21.118
Hmm.

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.705
Now that would be something.

01:09:24.915 --> 01:09:25.916
Wouldn't it?

01:09:30.671 --> 01:09:33.298
So, we all agree
the barbecue place is a good bet, right?

01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:35.133
- Mmm.
- [knocking]

01:09:41.974 --> 01:09:43.809
You must be Bernard Garrett.

01:09:45.519 --> 01:09:46.812
And you're Joe Morris?

01:09:46.895 --> 01:09:48.020
What, you follow me here?

01:09:48.104 --> 01:09:50.314
Just trying to understand
who really owns my bank.

01:09:58.532 --> 01:09:59.908
You boys are famous.

01:10:02.536 --> 01:10:05.330
That's you and Vice President Johnson,
if I'm not mistaken.

01:10:10.085 --> 01:10:11.086
Listen,

01:10:12.671 --> 01:10:14.673
I've got nothing against
you people personally.

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:16.425
That's mighty white of you.

01:10:16.508 --> 01:10:18.552
But if this town found out

01:10:18.635 --> 01:10:22.598
that not only was their bank
regularly making loans to Negroes,

01:10:23.599 --> 01:10:25.267
but was actually owned by two of 'em,

01:10:26.727 --> 01:10:28.061
there'd be a run on the bank.

01:10:29.146 --> 01:10:31.690
Well, why would they find out? Huh?

01:10:32.649 --> 01:10:34.276
They don't have access to our books.

01:10:34.651 --> 01:10:35.485
You do.

01:10:35.569 --> 01:10:37.362
Took you three months to figure it out.

01:10:38.447 --> 01:10:40.324
- I could tell 'em.
- Yeah, you could.

01:10:40.407 --> 01:10:43.285
Then you'd own 20% of a failed bank
instead of a booming one.

01:10:45.537 --> 01:10:46.580
What do you want?

01:10:48.248 --> 01:10:49.499
To protect my investment.

01:10:50.334 --> 01:10:54.213
This bank collapses, my 20% is worthless.

01:10:55.506 --> 01:10:57.132
So, we're in this together?

01:10:57.841 --> 01:10:59.051
Not quite.

01:10:59.134 --> 01:11:01.803
See, my father didn't know
he was selling his bank to two Negroes,

01:11:01.887 --> 01:11:04.348
so that's fraud.

01:11:04.848 --> 01:11:06.433
I don't know about that, Bob.

01:11:07.059 --> 01:11:10.771
See, both our names
were on that bank contract you signed.

01:11:10.854 --> 01:11:12.689
You even asked about us.

01:11:13.398 --> 01:11:14.733
Don't know who told you that.

01:11:14.816 --> 01:11:17.236
Didn't have to be told. I was there.

01:11:17.778 --> 01:11:19.112
[chuckles] No, you weren't.

01:11:21.156 --> 01:11:22.199
Bring back memories?

01:11:24.993 --> 01:11:27.412
And for the record, your father knew.

01:11:29.248 --> 01:11:30.249
You're lying.

01:11:30.332 --> 01:11:34.127
Ask him, or I can find a letter
where he and Silverthorne discussed it.

01:11:36.964 --> 01:11:38.590
You boys think you're so smart.

01:11:38.674 --> 01:11:39.716
[Joe] Oh, we are.

01:11:40.259 --> 01:11:41.635
For a couple colored boys.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.281
You couldn't just make a loan
here, there to your kind.

01:11:45.305 --> 01:11:47.558
You had to make 19 of them
right off the bat?

01:11:50.394 --> 01:11:51.854
Well, here's another letter.

01:11:51.937 --> 01:11:55.357
This one's from the Comptroller of
the Currency. The US Treasury Department.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.527
They're moving our yearly inspection up
two quarters.

01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:59.945
That's a month from now.

01:12:00.028 --> 01:12:02.823
Because of anonymous reports
we're making unsafe loans.

01:12:04.324 --> 01:12:07.786
You think you have this town figured out,
when you moved here three months ago?

01:12:08.996 --> 01:12:10.080
Well, you don't.

01:12:10.497 --> 01:12:11.498
I was born here.

01:12:11.582 --> 01:12:14.626
So was I. In this house.

01:12:18.422 --> 01:12:19.548
Well,

01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:22.968
then you should've known
you couldn't keep this a secret very long.

01:12:45.157 --> 01:12:48.660
We're gonna have to stop giving out loans
to Negroes until after this inspection.

01:12:48.744 --> 01:12:51.163
What about the ones already on the books?

01:12:53.332 --> 01:12:54.833
Can I propose something?

01:12:54.917 --> 01:12:56.460
Can I get a stiff drink?

01:12:58.587 --> 01:13:00.088
We should buy another bank.

01:13:00.172 --> 01:13:01.590
Make that a double.

01:13:02.633 --> 01:13:03.967
What? No, I'm...

01:13:04.051 --> 01:13:05.177
I'm serious.

01:13:06.178 --> 01:13:08.055
[thunderclap]

01:13:14.144 --> 01:13:15.938
Okay, the Bank of Marlin is small.

01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:18.690
You can purchase it outright for 274,000,

01:13:18.774 --> 01:13:21.318
half of what you paid for 80% of Mainland.

01:13:21.401 --> 01:13:22.653
As president of both banks,

01:13:22.736 --> 01:13:25.948
I could move all the Negro loans
we made at Mainland to the Bank of Marlin

01:13:26.031 --> 01:13:27.658
before Mainland gets inspected.

01:13:28.116 --> 01:13:30.369
It should keep the government
out of our business

01:13:30.452 --> 01:13:32.454
and hopefully make Florance an ally.

01:13:32.913 --> 01:13:34.122
It's an interesting idea,

01:13:34.206 --> 01:13:38.418
but Joe and I don't have
$274,000 in cash laying around.

01:13:39.127 --> 01:13:42.506
And I doubt Silverthorne will finance us
buying another bank in Texas.

01:13:42.589 --> 01:13:45.300
Right, well, I think I have
a solution to that.

01:13:46.343 --> 01:13:48.345
The Bank of Marlin has
two million in deposits,

01:13:48.428 --> 01:13:50.180
but it's only made one million in loans.

01:13:50.264 --> 01:13:51.932
Which is why it's not making a profit.

01:13:52.015 --> 01:13:53.058
So, we buy the bank.

01:13:53.141 --> 01:13:56.395
We use that extra million in deposits
to purchase loans from an aggregator.

01:13:56.770 --> 01:14:01.650
I've already identified a package of loans
with an 8% interest offered at 6.5%.

01:14:01.733 --> 01:14:04.945
That 1.5% spread
puts the bank instantly in profit.

01:14:05.028 --> 01:14:06.613
Unless there's a high default rate.

01:14:06.697 --> 01:14:08.282
Check the underlying loans yourself.

01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:09.950
They seem rock-solid to me.

01:14:10.033 --> 01:14:12.619
The whole package is for sale
for 971,000.

01:14:12.703 --> 01:14:15.831
Yeah, that doesn't help
the cash flow problem for Joe and me.

01:14:15.914 --> 01:14:19.793
All right, it doesn't,
but if you and Joe incorporate as brokers,

01:14:19.877 --> 01:14:21.753
the Bank of Marlin
can pay you a commission

01:14:21.837 --> 01:14:24.464
of close to 200,000
on that package of mortgages.

01:14:24.548 --> 01:14:28.302
That's an awful lot of commission
on a million-dollar package of mortgages.

01:14:28.385 --> 01:14:30.470
Maybe, but it's completely legal.

01:14:30.554 --> 01:14:32.139
It cuts your investment by two-thirds.

01:14:32.222 --> 01:14:35.142
The bank stays profitable
and we keep loaning to Negroes.

01:14:35.225 --> 01:14:36.226
Everyone wins.

01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:37.769
It sounds too good to be true.

01:14:38.228 --> 01:14:39.980
Well, then have your lawyers check.

01:14:41.064 --> 01:14:43.817
Look, Matt, even if it does check out,

01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:47.988
Joe has to spend his time in LA
overseeing our properties there.

01:14:48.488 --> 01:14:50.908
And I'm here
overseeing you and Mainland Bank,

01:14:50.991 --> 01:14:53.285
which I can't even get in
the front door of.

01:14:54.661 --> 01:14:58.373
I just don't think it's the right time
for us to pick up a second bank in Texas.

01:14:58.457 --> 01:15:00.959
Well, you won't have to,
if you let me run this one.

01:15:01.793 --> 01:15:02.793
I mean really run it.

01:15:05.589 --> 01:15:06.589
Matt,

01:15:07.674 --> 01:15:10.427
I can't speak for Joe,
but I'm not comfortable with that.

01:15:11.512 --> 01:15:13.805
[Susie] I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:15:13.889 --> 01:15:14.973
Would you like one?

01:15:15.057 --> 01:15:16.141
- No.
- Okay.

01:15:26.235 --> 01:15:28.946
Look, we agreed I'd co-own the next bank.

01:15:29.029 --> 01:15:30.405
We even put it in the contract.

01:15:30.822 --> 01:15:33.301
Three months ago, you didn't know
the first thing about banking.

01:15:33.325 --> 01:15:34.844
Come on. I've learnt a lot in that time.

01:15:34.868 --> 01:15:37.162
It's not that I don't have faith in you,
it's just...

01:15:38.205 --> 01:15:39.206
What?

01:15:40.165 --> 01:15:44.628
It's $274,000 of Joe's and my money.

01:15:45.379 --> 01:15:47.631
We should at least
have the final say, right?

01:15:47.714 --> 01:15:48.841
[sighs]

01:15:51.927 --> 01:15:53.303
If I can't become my own man here,

01:15:53.387 --> 01:15:55.514
then I think I need to resign
and go back to LA.

01:15:58.183 --> 01:16:00.727
- Is this you blackmailing us?
- No.

01:16:01.436 --> 01:16:02.563
No, that's not fair, Joe.

01:16:02.646 --> 01:16:04.147
You guys have taught me so much.

01:16:04.231 --> 01:16:05.649
I just wanna be more like you.

01:16:06.066 --> 01:16:07.067
An owner.

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:09.778
Whatever you decide...

01:16:11.196 --> 01:16:13.782
I really appreciate
everything you guys have done for me.

01:16:17.786 --> 01:16:20.038
[Bernard]
You said this was gonna be complicated.

01:16:20.122 --> 01:16:24.209
What I said was, "This is a bad idea."

01:16:25.502 --> 01:16:29.006
Then I agreed to drive off the cliff
with you and here we are.

01:16:29.965 --> 01:16:34.803
Now, we gotta buy a kid with 90 days of
banking experience his own goddamn bank.

01:16:36.597 --> 01:16:37.681
Without a chaperone.

01:16:45.731 --> 01:16:49.526
Hey, everyone, I just wanted to say
I'm excited to work with all of you.

01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:51.653
We're gonna do great things
with this bank.

01:16:51.737 --> 01:16:55.282
Growing it while helping the community
around it grow at the same time.

01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:57.868
My door is always open.

01:16:58.619 --> 01:17:00.412
Let's show the public our new face.

01:17:11.673 --> 01:17:15.010
Mmm. Twelfth loan in the package,
it's that one right there.

01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:18.263
Another beautiful house
in a white neighborhood.

01:17:18.347 --> 01:17:19.515
Give it a five.

01:17:22.434 --> 01:17:23.644
Thank you for doing this.

01:17:25.604 --> 01:17:27.064
How else am I supposed to learn?

01:17:37.241 --> 01:17:38.242
You can stop.

01:17:38.325 --> 01:17:40.536
There's no one here
to see you cleaning anymore.

01:17:40.619 --> 01:17:43.038
Whatever I do, I try to do my best.

01:17:46.959 --> 01:17:48.418
I'm sorry you have to wear that.

01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:52.339
I wish they'd just trust me,
then you wouldn't have to.

01:17:53.173 --> 01:17:54.716
Do you resent me being here?

01:17:57.511 --> 01:17:58.512
A little.

01:17:59.221 --> 01:18:00.389
[chuckles]

01:18:02.099 --> 01:18:04.309
Do you resent me
for wanting to run my own bank?

01:18:07.145 --> 01:18:08.146
A little.

01:18:09.064 --> 01:18:10.107
Really?

01:18:12.359 --> 01:18:14.403
Come on. You know
I wasn't born into money.

01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:16.989
I just learnt to fake it.
And you helped me.

01:18:20.325 --> 01:18:21.368
I do realize...

01:18:22.327 --> 01:18:23.954
I had to be white for that to work.

01:18:25.414 --> 01:18:26.456
And a man.

01:18:29.501 --> 01:18:30.502
I just...

01:18:32.212 --> 01:18:34.840
I wanna be respected
for what I've done for the business.

01:18:37.176 --> 01:18:38.886
Respect is a big thing.

01:18:39.553 --> 01:18:42.639
Sometimes people take big risks
to chase it.

01:18:43.891 --> 01:18:46.143
I want this bank to succeed
just as much as you do.

01:18:46.226 --> 01:18:47.603
I want you to succeed.

01:18:48.604 --> 01:18:50.814
And I hope you don't take this
the wrong way,

01:18:51.815 --> 01:18:54.484
but you just took up banking
three months ago.

01:18:57.237 --> 01:18:58.238
So did Bernard.

01:19:08.957 --> 01:19:09.958
They're all solid.

01:19:10.042 --> 01:19:12.461
We looked at the property
securing every single loan.

01:19:12.961 --> 01:19:14.087
[Matt] That was fast.

01:19:14.171 --> 01:19:18.050
Just be sure the documentation matches
exactly before handing over any money.

01:19:18.133 --> 01:19:18.967
Yeah, of course.

01:19:19.051 --> 01:19:21.303
And contact that lawyer I told you about
in Houston.

01:19:21.386 --> 01:19:24.306
I worked with him before.
O'Keefe. Michael O'Keefe. I trust him.

01:19:24.389 --> 01:19:25.909
I already did. He said he'll be there.

01:19:25.933 --> 01:19:26.934
Perfect.

01:19:27.476 --> 01:19:28.477
Excuse me.

01:19:29.353 --> 01:19:31.021
- Man, this place is so good.
- [chuckles]

01:19:31.855 --> 01:19:33.857
So, I'm gonna head back in the morning.

01:19:35.859 --> 01:19:37.236
It... It's okay.

01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:39.905
I'll have it fixed in no time.

01:19:47.371 --> 01:19:48.539
Okay.

01:19:56.505 --> 01:19:58.900
[John F. Kennedy] <i> I thought his statement
was rather cautiously worded.</i>

01:19:58.924 --> 01:20:01.802
<i>I didn't get any assurances
that Mr. Khrushchev or the Soviet Union</i>

01:20:01.885 --> 01:20:04.054
<i>was out of the space race at all.</i>

01:20:04.137 --> 01:20:04.972
<i>I think it's...</i>

01:20:05.055 --> 01:20:08.684
Mr. Steiner, your attorney's almost
finished reviewing the packet of loans.

01:20:08.767 --> 01:20:09.810
Great.

01:20:16.441 --> 01:20:18.277
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thanks.

01:20:18.819 --> 01:20:21.405
Thank you again for doing this so quickly.

01:20:21.822 --> 01:20:23.448
How are the underlying loans looking?

01:20:23.532 --> 01:20:25.993
Solid. You can start
signing the contracts now.

01:20:26.076 --> 01:20:27.077
Great.

01:20:50.184 --> 01:20:51.351
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:20:54.354 --> 01:20:55.606
Hi. How are you?

01:20:55.689 --> 01:20:56.732
Good, how are you?

01:20:56.815 --> 01:20:58.066
Good.

01:20:58.150 --> 01:20:59.193
How'd it go?

01:21:00.277 --> 01:21:03.238
Well, I just wrote a check for $971,000.

01:21:03.322 --> 01:21:04.962
- [both chuckle]
- Never done that before.

01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:07.034
You're a natural businessman.

01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:09.328
I don't know. I mean...

01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:12.515
tell that to the people who invested
in the drive-in ice cream shop.

01:21:12.539 --> 01:21:13.665
You were 19.

01:21:14.082 --> 01:21:16.502
Yeah. But, I dunno,
it was my dad's savings.

01:21:16.585 --> 01:21:19.296
I just don't want to lose
Bernard and Joe's money the same way.

01:21:19.379 --> 01:21:20.631
They're lucky to have you.

01:21:20.714 --> 01:21:24.051
No. I'm the lucky one. I'm learning
from people a lot smarter than I am.

01:21:25.135 --> 01:21:26.220
Matt,

01:21:26.303 --> 01:21:27.763
they're not smarter than you.

01:21:28.222 --> 01:21:30.015
I mean, they can't be.

01:21:31.517 --> 01:21:33.352
- They're my friends.
- [phone rings]

01:21:33.435 --> 01:21:35.896
Hey. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't...

01:21:35.979 --> 01:21:37.523
- No.
- Just... Matt.

01:21:38.232 --> 01:21:39.316
Don't talk like that.

01:21:40.901 --> 01:21:41.944
Hello?

01:21:42.694 --> 01:21:43.694
It's Florance.

01:21:45.197 --> 01:21:46.698
I've got four white customers here

01:21:46.782 --> 01:21:49.201
saying they wanna withdraw all their money
from the bank

01:21:49.284 --> 01:21:50.577
because they think it's owned

01:21:50.661 --> 01:21:53.705
by the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.

01:21:55.457 --> 01:21:56.792
[sighs]

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.470
This was on the door at Mainland.

01:22:10.347 --> 01:22:11.348
[Joe] Subtle.

01:22:12.391 --> 01:22:16.103
Five white customers withdrew
all their money in the past two days.

01:22:16.478 --> 01:22:18.897
Nine were convinced by Florance to stay.

01:22:19.523 --> 01:22:20.524
Fitting.

01:22:20.607 --> 01:22:25.237
Considering Florance probably the one
who started and spread the rumors himself.

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.239
What? Why would you say that?

01:22:28.657 --> 01:22:30.617
Told you long time ago, Bernard.

01:22:30.701 --> 01:22:31.702
I don't trust people.

01:22:32.619 --> 01:22:34.580
Especially white people. I remember.

01:22:34.663 --> 01:22:38.667
No, what I said was white and black.

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:42.004
The difference is,
when a white person screws you over,

01:22:42.087 --> 01:22:45.299
they can count on other white folks
out there to look the other way.

01:22:45.382 --> 01:22:48.760
And just knowing that
brings out the worst in people.

01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:53.348
How can you be so pessimistic
and still get out the bed in the morning?

01:22:54.433 --> 01:22:56.894
Even a rigged game's fun to play, Bernard.

01:23:06.695 --> 01:23:07.696
Matt Steiner?

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:09.698
Yes.

01:23:09.781 --> 01:23:12.743
I'm an examiner with the office
of the Comptroller of the Currency.

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:15.704
How can I help you?

01:23:16.288 --> 01:23:18.749
[phone rings]

01:23:24.421 --> 01:23:25.422
Hello?

01:23:25.506 --> 01:23:27.841
A federal bank examiner
just left my office.

01:23:27.925 --> 01:23:29.635
<i>I thought that wasn't until next month.</i>

01:23:29.718 --> 01:23:31.470
No, I meant Marlin, not Mainland.

01:23:33.764 --> 01:23:34.890
What did he say?

01:23:35.766 --> 01:23:38.227
To get the master books out.
He's coming back in an hour.

01:23:39.811 --> 01:23:40.812
Shit.

01:23:42.898 --> 01:23:43.941
This can't be chance.

01:23:44.024 --> 01:23:45.192
Matt's not ready.

01:23:45.275 --> 01:23:46.276
Well, how could he be?

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.778
And he's gonna get tripped up.

01:23:47.861 --> 01:23:49.154
We can't let that happen.

01:23:49.238 --> 01:23:53.075
I'd have to be sitting in the room next to
him the whole time for it not to happen.

01:23:53.158 --> 01:23:55.244
And I can't exactly do that, now can I?

01:23:55.327 --> 01:23:57.246
Well, you could do something close to it.

01:23:58.622 --> 01:24:01.083
[scoffs] There's gotta be another way.

01:24:03.961 --> 01:24:06.672
Well, Joe's not too proud
to put on a chauffeur's uniform.

01:24:06.755 --> 01:24:09.424
Well, Joe was born
with a silver spoon in his mouth.

01:24:09.508 --> 01:24:11.051
For him it's like playing dress-up.

01:24:11.134 --> 01:24:13.804
Well, I wasn't.
I was barely born with a spoon.

01:24:13.887 --> 01:24:16.557
How many times have I worn this uniform
to help this business?

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.641
You're...

01:24:18.183 --> 01:24:19.685
- A woman?
- Yeah.

01:24:21.895 --> 01:24:22.771
I love you, Bernard.

01:24:22.855 --> 01:24:24.791
But how is that any different
from a white man telling you

01:24:24.815 --> 01:24:26.900
you shouldn't mind
some daily assault on your dignity

01:24:26.984 --> 01:24:27.985
because you're black?

01:25:28.128 --> 01:25:30.506
Should've took limo driver
when you had the chance.

01:25:31.757 --> 01:25:34.510
I don't like what hats do
to the shape of my face.

01:25:35.219 --> 01:25:36.845
You made an actual joke.

01:25:36.929 --> 01:25:38.931
Well, what else can I do
in this situation?

01:25:39.014 --> 01:25:43.185
Mm-hmm.
See, you find out how life really works,

01:25:44.269 --> 01:25:45.646
can't do nothing but laugh.

01:25:49.566 --> 01:25:51.944
You sure you don't want
a coffee or anything?

01:25:52.027 --> 01:25:53.028
No, thank you.

01:25:53.111 --> 01:25:54.655
A cold water maybe?

01:25:54.738 --> 01:25:56.615
As of close of business Friday,

01:25:56.698 --> 01:26:00.285
the total number of loans delinquent
beyond 60 days was under 5%?

01:26:01.703 --> 01:26:02.704
Yes.

01:26:02.788 --> 01:26:04.206
What was the exact percentage?

01:26:07.125 --> 01:26:08.418
3%.

01:26:17.886 --> 01:26:21.473
We are discussing
confidential information.

01:26:21.932 --> 01:26:23.851
I'm sure the janitor
wouldn't understand it.

01:26:23.934 --> 01:26:25.102
Someone else might.

01:26:29.481 --> 01:26:31.066
Take me through this transaction.

01:26:31.775 --> 01:26:35.362
That's a package of loans we bought
to increase our loan-to-capital ratio.

01:26:37.865 --> 01:26:38.866
He's in trouble.

01:26:41.702 --> 01:26:43.537
I can read the description myself.

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:45.914
I'm curious about this related charge.

01:26:45.998 --> 01:26:52.129
$189,186.04
to Valley National Mortgage Company.

01:26:52.713 --> 01:26:54.381
There's no description for that.

01:26:54.882 --> 01:26:56.175
It's a broker's fee.

01:26:58.010 --> 01:27:04.433
$189,000 as a finder's fee
for a $971,000 package of loans

01:27:05.017 --> 01:27:06.935
sitting in an aggregator's office
in Houston?

01:27:07.603 --> 01:27:09.146
That's a pretty hefty finder's fee.

01:27:09.771 --> 01:27:14.234
No, 19.5%, but that includes payment
for future consultation.

01:27:14.776 --> 01:27:16.612
Well, that's a strange arrangement.

01:27:16.695 --> 01:27:18.113
Mr. Garrett and Mr. Morris?

01:27:18.197 --> 01:27:20.449
Is that something that should concern you?

01:27:20.532 --> 01:27:22.618
Aren't you here
to make sure my bank is sound?

01:27:23.869 --> 01:27:25.913
Okay, let's turn to the loans themselves.

01:27:26.997 --> 01:27:30.834
You paid $971,213 for these loans.

01:27:30.918 --> 01:27:33.128
You have them valued as such
on your books.

01:27:33.212 --> 01:27:34.546
Yes, of course.

01:27:34.630 --> 01:27:37.966
Show me the methodology you used
to justify that book value.

01:27:39.635 --> 01:27:41.011
I have an expert to do that.

01:27:41.094 --> 01:27:42.179
Bring him in, please.

01:27:44.389 --> 01:27:45.432
He's not in today.

01:27:50.479 --> 01:27:53.273
But I can, uh, check his files.

01:27:53.774 --> 01:27:54.900
Please.

01:28:08.872 --> 01:28:12.668
He wants to know the exact methodology
we used to value the loans in the package.

01:28:12.751 --> 01:28:13.752
Okay.

01:28:14.545 --> 01:28:15.546
Pay attention.

01:28:16.588 --> 01:28:18.549
It's a standard present value equation.

01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:22.636
This is an individual loan's
monthly payment schedule.

01:28:22.719 --> 01:28:25.347
Now, adjust that
with the risk factor for default.

01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:27.516
Standard 5% in Texas.

01:28:27.975 --> 01:28:28.976
That's what I used.

01:28:30.018 --> 01:28:31.144
Tear that out for me.

01:28:31.228 --> 01:28:33.122
You can't go in the room
with that piece of paper.

01:28:33.146 --> 01:28:34.773
It's got Bernard's handwriting on it.

01:28:34.857 --> 01:28:35.875
- Memorize it.
- No, I can't.

01:28:35.899 --> 01:28:38.110
Sure you can. You got a great memory.

01:28:38.193 --> 01:28:39.069
No, I'm too nervous.

01:28:39.152 --> 01:28:40.279
Hey, listen.

01:28:40.362 --> 01:28:43.282
You fail this test
and he's gonna write down those loans

01:28:43.365 --> 01:28:45.125
and it'll threaten
the stability of the bank.

01:28:45.158 --> 01:28:46.158
Your bank.

01:28:46.618 --> 01:28:47.703
This is your bank, Matt.

01:28:47.786 --> 01:28:50.205
Now, pull it together
and go out there and save it.

01:28:52.082 --> 01:28:53.709
Okay, let me see that one more time.

01:28:59.256 --> 01:29:02.426
Okay, I have the methodology.

01:29:02.509 --> 01:29:03.594
Put a pin in that.

01:29:03.677 --> 01:29:06.305
I found problems with individual loans
while you were gone.

01:29:06.972 --> 01:29:09.099
I valued those loans conservatively.

01:29:09.516 --> 01:29:10.809
We didn't do anything wrong.

01:29:10.893 --> 01:29:14.354
They wanna shut us down,
they got plenty ways they can do that.

01:29:14.771 --> 01:29:16.773
"5% default rate?

01:29:17.649 --> 01:29:20.152
Hell. What if there's a drought?

01:29:20.235 --> 01:29:22.571
You niggers need to value them loans

01:29:22.654 --> 01:29:26.575
assuming there's gonna be
a once-in-a-generation drought.

01:29:27.075 --> 01:29:29.661
25% default rate for y'all."

01:29:31.705 --> 01:29:34.208
This loan's gonna have to be
sold off immediately.

01:29:35.375 --> 01:29:36.710
And this one.

01:29:37.127 --> 01:29:39.087
And this one.

01:29:39.171 --> 01:29:41.215
Why? Why? What's wrong with them?

01:29:41.298 --> 01:29:43.175
Well, that loan is for $21,000.

01:29:43.258 --> 01:29:45.844
Your capital account is $200,000.

01:29:45.928 --> 01:29:46.929
Okay.

01:29:49.139 --> 01:29:51.391
You don't understand why that's a problem,
do you?

01:29:52.935 --> 01:29:57.439
The National Banking Act specifies that no
bank shall have a single loan on the books

01:29:57.523 --> 01:29:59.858
that exceeds 10% of equity capital.

01:29:59.942 --> 01:30:02.069
Or $20,000 in this case.

01:30:02.986 --> 01:30:03.986
Right.

01:30:07.574 --> 01:30:09.284
Okay, but this one's only 4,000.

01:30:09.368 --> 01:30:11.578
It's for a 25-year term.
Same with this one.

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.582
A bank of this size
is limited to 20-year terms.

01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:20.879
And this loan is legal on its face,
but it's three months delinquent.

01:30:21.797 --> 01:30:24.716
I'm not gonna require you to sell it,
but I'm gonna classify it.

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:27.135
Take its value down on your books by 40%

01:30:27.219 --> 01:30:29.137
to account for the elevated risk
of default.

01:30:35.394 --> 01:30:38.146
Hold on. I'll be right back.

01:30:43.569 --> 01:30:45.612
How the hell
did these loans get in the package?

01:30:45.696 --> 01:30:47.573
- I don't know.
- Unacceptable.

01:30:47.656 --> 01:30:49.658
I looked over every individual loan, Matt.

01:30:49.741 --> 01:30:52.578
There was nothing over $20,000.
Nothing over 20 years.

01:30:52.661 --> 01:30:54.913
Did you look at the loans
when you picked them up?

01:30:55.581 --> 01:30:57.666
Did you look at the goddamn loans?

01:30:57.749 --> 01:30:59.909
Yes, I looked through them.
Maybe not carefully enough.

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:00.961
I read the top sheet...

01:31:01.044 --> 01:31:02.171
Unbelievable.

01:31:02.713 --> 01:31:04.381
Well, they can't lie on the top sheet.

01:31:04.464 --> 01:31:07.926
- Matt, there aren't any limiters.
- What?

01:31:08.010 --> 01:31:10.929
There isn't anything on this top sheet
about individual loan limits,

01:31:11.013 --> 01:31:12.598
dollar amounts or durations.

01:31:12.681 --> 01:31:13.932
They're all averages.

01:31:15.142 --> 01:31:16.268
They didn't lie.

01:31:16.351 --> 01:31:18.270
They just hid the shit in the averages.

01:31:18.353 --> 01:31:20.689
How the hell did our lawyer miss that?

01:31:21.315 --> 01:31:23.400
- I couldn't use O'Keefe.
- What?

01:31:23.483 --> 01:31:26.163
Bernard checked the properties so fast
I moved up the purchase date.

01:31:26.236 --> 01:31:28.047
O'Keefe couldn't make it,
so I hired someone else.

01:31:28.071 --> 01:31:29.671
- How did you find him?
- I asked around.

01:31:29.698 --> 01:31:32.075
You asked... He asked around.
What the hell's that mean?

01:31:32.159 --> 01:31:34.912
We told you you weren't ready
to run your own bank. We told you.

01:31:34.995 --> 01:31:36.830
You forced our hand. Now here we are.

01:31:36.914 --> 01:31:37.915
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:31:38.624 --> 01:31:43.295
Who exactly did you ask
to find this lawyer?

01:31:45.672 --> 01:31:46.673
Who, Matt?

01:31:47.508 --> 01:31:48.509
Florance.

01:31:49.593 --> 01:31:50.719
Florance?

01:31:51.303 --> 01:31:52.888
You asked Florance?

01:31:54.264 --> 01:31:56.558
He switched the goddamn mortgages.

01:31:56.642 --> 01:31:57.809
Why? Why would he do that?

01:31:57.893 --> 01:31:59.228
To kill Marlin.

01:31:59.311 --> 01:32:03.023
And the worst part is I have to learn
about it here, in this ridiculous outfit,

01:32:03.106 --> 01:32:04.274
that you helped him do it!

01:32:04.358 --> 01:32:05.901
No, that's gotta be illegal, right?

01:32:06.902 --> 01:32:08.487
What does he get from that, anyway?

01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:09.988
Leverage.

01:32:10.072 --> 01:32:12.282
Against us at Mainland.

01:32:13.075 --> 01:32:14.868
Or maybe just to watch us fail.

01:32:24.127 --> 01:32:29.883
We have to sell 27 bad loans in a week
and cover all the markdowns ourselves.

01:32:31.176 --> 01:32:33.053
We're gonna lose $300,000,

01:32:33.136 --> 01:32:38.308
unless Matt Steiner can make Marlin
the most successful bank in Texas history.

01:32:41.854 --> 01:32:43.647
Or you could let it close.

01:32:45.899 --> 01:32:47.359
Matt got you here, you didn't.

01:32:47.442 --> 01:32:49.570
No, I did.

01:32:50.404 --> 01:32:54.074
Soon as I thought I was clever enough
to come down here and take on all of this.

01:32:54.867 --> 01:32:55.909
Joe warned me.

01:32:57.035 --> 01:32:58.036
You warned me.

01:33:00.497 --> 01:33:02.499
My daddy warned me when I was 13.

01:33:07.004 --> 01:33:10.465
If this was easy, somebody else
would have done it a long time ago.

01:33:16.263 --> 01:33:18.098
So, you're just gonna walk away from it?

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:20.184
It's the only rational thing to do.

01:33:20.267 --> 01:33:21.727
No, we could sue the bastards.

01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:25.147
You signed a document saying
you knew exactly what you were buying.

01:33:25.230 --> 01:33:27.065
But the lawyer lied to me. We can sue him.

01:33:27.149 --> 01:33:29.318
Maybe you can, Matt, but we can't.

01:33:29.943 --> 01:33:32.654
Me and Bernard can't win that case,
not in Texas.

01:33:33.197 --> 01:33:36.241
Plus, Marlin will be gone by then anyway.

01:33:36.325 --> 01:33:39.036
I'm not gonna lose Marlin.
There's gotta be something I can do.

01:33:39.119 --> 01:33:40.120
Look, I'm sorry, Matt.

01:33:40.204 --> 01:33:43.081
I know it was your baby,
but I need you to focus on Mainland now.

01:33:45.459 --> 01:33:46.460
Well, how?

01:33:46.543 --> 01:33:47.961
Keep an eye on Florance.

01:33:48.045 --> 01:33:50.172
And make sure when white folks
come in that bank,

01:33:50.255 --> 01:33:52.591
they see a white man
in the president's office

01:33:52.674 --> 01:33:54.468
so they won't pull their deposits.

01:33:57.554 --> 01:33:58.805
[door closes]

01:34:09.650 --> 01:34:11.443
[phone rings]

01:34:15.322 --> 01:34:16.532
Garrett residence.

01:34:17.074 --> 01:34:19.201
Yes, he's here. Just a moment.

01:34:19.701 --> 01:34:21.161
Joe, it's for you.

01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:24.498
Yeah, this is Joe.

01:34:24.581 --> 01:34:25.642
You didn't hear this from me,

01:34:25.666 --> 01:34:29.044
but I got a friend at the Comptroller's
office who kind of looks out for me.

01:34:29.753 --> 01:34:30.921
Called me yesterday to say

01:34:31.004 --> 01:34:34.091
Matt Steiner managed to get all
"must sell" loans off Marlin's books.

01:34:34.591 --> 01:34:35.425
That don't matter,

01:34:35.509 --> 01:34:38.071
'cause we decided we ain't gonna
put no more money in there anyhow.

01:34:38.095 --> 01:34:39.805
At face value. No discount.

01:34:39.888 --> 01:34:42.516
Which means Marlin's in the black again,
fully solvent...

01:34:43.725 --> 01:34:45.018
without capital from you.

01:34:46.019 --> 01:34:49.273
Who the hell would pay face value
for those piece of shit loans?

01:34:49.898 --> 01:34:51.817
Mainland bank in Willis, Texas.

01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:53.026
Say what?

01:34:53.569 --> 01:34:55.404
Son of a bitch!

01:35:18.927 --> 01:35:20.220
What the hell are you doing?

01:35:20.304 --> 01:35:21.889
You had Mainland pay face value

01:35:21.972 --> 01:35:24.558
for the loans the feds
already had you mark down at Marlin?

01:35:24.641 --> 01:35:25.809
It's just temporary.

01:35:25.893 --> 01:35:28.145
- It's fraud.
- No, if we classify them differently...

01:35:28.228 --> 01:35:31.064
If you keep this up,
you're gonna sink both banks, Matt.

01:35:31.815 --> 01:35:32.941
Get the books.

01:35:33.609 --> 01:35:35.944
- Shouldn't we wait until...
- Get the goddamn books now.

01:35:54.922 --> 01:35:57.090
All I did was transfer the...

01:35:57.174 --> 01:35:59.551
Matthew Steiner,
president of Mainland Bank?

01:36:00.761 --> 01:36:01.762
- Yes.
- I'm Norman Dunn,

01:36:01.845 --> 01:36:04.765
Deputy Comptroller of the Currency
for the Southern District.

01:36:04.848 --> 01:36:08.101
The Treasury Department has revoked
Mainland's license to do banking.

01:36:08.185 --> 01:36:11.897
Your bank is being placed in FDIC
receivership per the National Banking Act.

01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:13.899
This is Mr. Amos of the FDIC.

01:36:14.316 --> 01:36:16.610
Mr. Steiner, you're fired.

01:36:16.693 --> 01:36:18.546
I'm going to need to escort you
from the building now.

01:36:18.570 --> 01:36:20.531
Please leave the ledgers where they are.

01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:24.159
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:36:24.243 --> 01:36:28.288
the United States Treasury Department
has closed this bank until further notice.

01:36:28.372 --> 01:36:32.459
All deposits up to $10,000
are insured by the federal government.

01:36:32.543 --> 01:36:36.380
Upon FDIC review of the bank's books,
your money will be returned to you.

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.799
The building is now closed to the public.

01:36:38.882 --> 01:36:40.968
We must ask that you leave.

01:36:50.644 --> 01:36:53.188
I'm so sorry.
I thought that I could save both...

01:36:53.272 --> 01:36:54.314
Get out of my face.

01:36:55.065 --> 01:36:57.192
- Bernard Garrett and Joseph Morris?
- Yes.

01:36:57.276 --> 01:36:59.111
- FBI. You're under arrest.
- For what?

01:36:59.194 --> 01:37:00.338
Turn around and face the wall.

01:37:00.362 --> 01:37:02.757
No. What are we under arrest for?
What did we do that's illegal?

01:37:02.781 --> 01:37:04.008
- The judge will tell you that.
- No, screw the judge.

01:37:04.032 --> 01:37:05.885
- You tell me what we did that's illegal.
- Bernard.

01:37:05.909 --> 01:37:07.220
- What's he complaining about?
- I get it.

01:37:07.244 --> 01:37:10.098
A black man makes some money and it's okay
as long as he keeps to himself.

01:37:10.122 --> 01:37:12.433
But if he try to bring other brothers up,
that's intolerable.

01:37:12.457 --> 01:37:14.126
This is happening, Mr. Garrett.

01:37:14.209 --> 01:37:17.379
The only question to ask yourself
is do you want to get hurt fighting it?

01:37:18.255 --> 01:37:20.257
- Hey, get off of him!
- Bernard, no! No!

01:37:21.383 --> 01:37:22.676
[groaning]

01:37:23.927 --> 01:37:26.263
- [handcuffs clicking]
- Come on.

01:37:36.899 --> 01:37:40.068
[man] <i>The state banking charges
have all been dropped.</i>

01:37:40.152 --> 01:37:43.822
The federal charges,
however, are all still in place.

01:37:44.656 --> 01:37:48.410
Now, it's my feeling
that we're in a political space here.

01:37:48.785 --> 01:37:50.454
So if we play our cards right,

01:37:50.954 --> 01:37:53.332
we'll be able to get
those charges dropped as well.

01:37:53.415 --> 01:37:54.499
Political how?

01:37:55.334 --> 01:37:57.503
Well, Senator John McClellan of Arkansas

01:37:57.586 --> 01:38:01.632
is holding a set of hearings
on federally funded banks.

01:38:01.715 --> 01:38:07.221
The goal seems to be to shit all over
the so-called "lax oversight"

01:38:07.304 --> 01:38:09.139
that our Treasury provides,

01:38:09.723 --> 01:38:13.685
so as to justify his committee
expanding its jurisdiction.

01:38:13.769 --> 01:38:18.106
Thereby ensuring a steady stream
of campaign donations

01:38:18.190 --> 01:38:20.734
and favors from the banking industry.

01:38:20.817 --> 01:38:22.819
So, what does that have to do with me?

01:38:22.903 --> 01:38:24.988
You want the stated
or the unstated version?

01:38:26.365 --> 01:38:27.366
Unstated.

01:38:27.449 --> 01:38:30.619
"We need to change these laws.
And I mean quick!

01:38:30.702 --> 01:38:35.290
Or niggers like these can own banks
and loan money to other niggers."

01:38:35.374 --> 01:38:36.375
That.

01:38:37.376 --> 01:38:39.044
[Joe] On the bright side, Bernard,

01:38:39.127 --> 01:38:42.881
'cause we fit so neatly
into McClellan's power grab,

01:38:43.382 --> 01:38:47.845
the whole country's talkin' about
how two Negroes managed to buy two banks

01:38:47.928 --> 01:38:52.057
full of white folks' money in Texas
and loan it to other Negroes.

01:38:52.432 --> 01:38:55.769
I thought McClellan was one of the first
people to stand up to McCarthyism.

01:38:55.853 --> 01:38:58.856
- He was.
- So he must be a decent man, right?

01:38:58.939 --> 01:38:59.939
[chuckles]

01:39:02.109 --> 01:39:06.196
You know, Bernard, I don't have
the ability to look into a man's soul.

01:39:07.406 --> 01:39:09.032
But I will tell you this...

01:39:09.616 --> 01:39:11.994
he means to make a point
with these hearings.

01:39:12.077 --> 01:39:14.162
And if you want
to help him make that point,

01:39:14.746 --> 01:39:19.710
I highly doubt that you're gonna have any
problem with any kind of criminal charges.

01:39:21.837 --> 01:39:23.547
So, where's Matt in all this?

01:39:23.630 --> 01:39:26.341
Now, that is a good question.

01:39:35.475 --> 01:39:37.019
My lawyer doesn't want me here.

01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:40.900
[man 2] Then your lawyer doesn't have
your best interests at heart, Matt.

01:39:41.315 --> 01:39:44.026
Because we can make a deal here
that could save your life.

01:39:44.109 --> 01:39:45.319
How does that work exactly?

01:39:46.570 --> 01:39:47.571
You're gonna...

01:39:48.155 --> 01:39:50.574
give me back my money? My house?

01:39:51.658 --> 01:39:52.868
Hardly.

01:39:52.951 --> 01:39:55.037
But I can give you immunity.

01:39:55.495 --> 01:39:57.623
And you might avoid
being called to account

01:39:58.248 --> 01:40:01.001
for lying to the public
on 23 separate occasions

01:40:01.084 --> 01:40:04.171
about the true ownership
of the Mainland and Marlin banks.

01:40:05.172 --> 01:40:08.091
Fraudulently valuing loans in these banks.

01:40:09.134 --> 01:40:13.263
Illegally transferring said loans
between the banks in question.

01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:18.101
It's an easy story to tell,

01:40:18.894 --> 01:40:22.105
how these two men manipulated you,

01:40:23.190 --> 01:40:27.402
used you to make money by duping everyday
citizens into thinking you were the boss,

01:40:27.486 --> 01:40:30.948
when really it was
two Negroes pulling the strings.

01:40:32.908 --> 01:40:35.327
But they didn't force me
to do the things I did.

01:40:36.286 --> 01:40:37.955
They were careful to follow the law.

01:40:38.038 --> 01:40:40.499
You won't find any evidence
that they committed a crime.

01:40:40.874 --> 01:40:42.793
See, that's the thing about banking crime,

01:40:43.794 --> 01:40:46.129
there's always a subjective element to it.

01:40:46.797 --> 01:40:47.840
Now,

01:40:48.465 --> 01:40:51.134
these two Negroes earned...

01:40:52.886 --> 01:40:55.681
189,000 between the two of them,

01:40:56.682 --> 01:41:02.521
off a $971,000 purchase of mortgages
that in fact were worth 663,000.

01:41:02.604 --> 01:41:06.483
See, that is a misuse of bank funds
in my book.

01:41:07.484 --> 01:41:09.152
And a misuse of bank funds is a crime.

01:41:09.236 --> 01:41:10.737
It's more complicated than that.

01:41:10.821 --> 01:41:12.406
I don't think it is, Mr. Steiner.

01:41:13.907 --> 01:41:17.703
Unless you're telling me they didn't force
you to buy these dog-shit mortgages...

01:41:19.705 --> 01:41:23.083
so they could bilk the bank
of $189,000 of commission.

01:41:25.794 --> 01:41:27.212
Then maybe they are innocent

01:41:28.964 --> 01:41:31.049
and maybe
someone else needs to go to prison.

01:41:39.057 --> 01:41:42.561
- I'm really sorry I ever brought him in.
- You didn't force me to hire him.

01:41:43.061 --> 01:41:45.189
Joe warned me a dozen times as well.

01:41:47.733 --> 01:41:49.526
Just wanted to believe in him, I guess.

01:41:49.943 --> 01:41:51.195
Hmm.

01:41:52.112 --> 01:41:55.490
I hope whoever owns this place is taking
good care of you for the renovation.

01:41:58.493 --> 01:41:59.494
He is...

01:42:01.205 --> 01:42:02.206
'cause it's me.

01:42:05.626 --> 01:42:06.627
Yeah.

01:42:07.503 --> 01:42:09.046
Yeah.

01:42:28.690 --> 01:42:31.777
[man 2] <i>So, it's your testimony that
you've always been under the direction</i>

01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:33.570
of Bernard Garrett and Joe Morris.

01:42:33.654 --> 01:42:34.780
Is that correct?

01:42:38.450 --> 01:42:39.701
It is. Yes.

01:42:40.619 --> 01:42:42.829
You ever refuse an order
from Garrett or Morris?

01:42:44.581 --> 01:42:48.752
For example, the initial purchase
of mortgages by the Marlin bank,

01:42:49.545 --> 01:42:54.132
for which Garrett and Morris
were compensated $189,000,

01:42:55.008 --> 01:42:58.887
or Mainland Bank's subsequent purchase
at grossly inflated prices

01:42:59.805 --> 01:43:01.640
of problem mortgages from Marlin?

01:43:04.768 --> 01:43:07.646
They were my employers.
I carried out their wishes to the letter.

01:43:51.607 --> 01:43:53.847
[man 2] <i>I'm surprised
you requested this meeting, Melvin.</i>

01:43:54.651 --> 01:43:57.779
{\an8}It seemed my offer required
a simple answer, yes or no.

01:43:58.572 --> 01:44:00.908
{\an8}Especially given
how solid Steiner was today.

01:44:01.742 --> 01:44:03.869
Well, John, Bernard's not the kind of man

01:44:03.952 --> 01:44:06.705
to make a deal
without checking all the details.

01:44:06.788 --> 01:44:08.540
[chuckles]

01:44:08.624 --> 01:44:11.251
It seems to me
that a large part of his purported defense

01:44:11.335 --> 01:44:12.461
is that he did just that.

01:44:14.463 --> 01:44:17.424
You want me to put the banking rules
on trial in my testimony.

01:44:17.841 --> 01:44:19.259
I want you to tell the truth.

01:44:20.093 --> 01:44:21.720
Which should have that result, yes.

01:44:23.472 --> 01:44:26.934
The rules allowed you
to hide your identity from the public

01:44:27.017 --> 01:44:32.397
and take the successive actions that led
to two national banks becoming insolvent,

01:44:33.982 --> 01:44:37.778
risking the savings
of thousands of innocent depositors.

01:44:39.029 --> 01:44:40.906
You and I see the truth very differently.

01:44:42.741 --> 01:44:44.034
Son, I'm from Arkansas.

01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.121
You don't have to tell me that Negroes
sometimes get the short end of the stick.

01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:49.706
"Sometimes."

01:44:52.709 --> 01:44:54.169
We're not gonna change that here.

01:44:56.380 --> 01:44:59.633
The truth is, whatever obstacles
they put in your way,

01:44:59.716 --> 01:45:02.219
you kept your head down,
did your business,

01:45:02.594 --> 01:45:06.265
became one of the richest Negroes
in the country.

01:45:10.352 --> 01:45:12.187
You were living the American dream

01:45:14.398 --> 01:45:19.444
before you decided to go mucking around
with the social order in Texas.

01:45:21.572 --> 01:45:22.948
Might be a lesson there.

01:45:23.657 --> 01:45:24.741
You have a choice now.

01:45:26.827 --> 01:45:28.704
Take the immunity deal.

01:45:28.787 --> 01:45:32.457
Go in there and confirm
what Steiner just told us,

01:45:32.541 --> 01:45:37.880
that you took advantage of lax rules
in order to enrich yourself.

01:45:38.839 --> 01:45:42.092
And let Congress fix those rules,
and you'll be a free man.

01:45:43.177 --> 01:45:45.762
Or you can refuse the deal...

01:45:46.847 --> 01:45:48.015
and say whatever you want.

01:45:50.184 --> 01:45:51.185
But just know,

01:45:52.728 --> 01:45:58.400
after you're done saying your piece
about racism and the plight of the Negro,

01:45:58.483 --> 01:46:01.195
we're gonna compare your testimony
point for point

01:46:01.278 --> 01:46:03.322
with what we heard
from Steiner and Florance,

01:46:03.405 --> 01:46:05.157
and a whole bunch of other white people.

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:08.994
Well, thank God the Constitution
doesn't make those types of distinctions.

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.914
Well, at the end of all that,

01:46:11.997 --> 01:46:14.124
a determination will be made
by a court of law

01:46:14.208 --> 01:46:15.876
to decide who's telling the truth...

01:46:16.919 --> 01:46:17.920
and who's lying.

01:46:19.505 --> 01:46:21.006
And the liars are going to prison.

01:46:25.761 --> 01:46:27.763
[Eunice] Sure is pretty from the outside.

01:46:31.767 --> 01:46:33.007
[Bernard] Guess you were right.

01:46:33.685 --> 01:46:36.813
It was too early
for two Negroes to own a bank in Texas.

01:46:38.398 --> 01:46:39.399
Maybe.

01:46:39.983 --> 01:46:41.985
Or maybe you were right to do it now.

01:46:44.238 --> 01:46:45.322
Why?

01:46:47.783 --> 01:46:48.992
Look where you ended up.

01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:54.331
White people get to buy homes
and build businesses

01:46:54.414 --> 01:46:56.083
because banks will loan them money.

01:46:57.376 --> 01:46:58.669
Black people don't.

01:46:58.752 --> 01:47:01.755
And maybe it is time that someone
shine a bright light on that now,

01:47:02.339 --> 01:47:04.007
in order for things to change.

01:47:05.259 --> 01:47:09.012
Well, if I shine the light too bright,
McClellan will get rid of my immunity.

01:47:12.099 --> 01:47:13.809
What do you think I should do in there?

01:47:15.853 --> 01:47:18.021
Everyone thought I was crazy to marry you.

01:47:20.232 --> 01:47:22.776
You always thought differently
from everyone else.

01:47:24.403 --> 01:47:26.738
But that's why
I fell in love with you, Bernard.

01:47:27.906 --> 01:47:31.702
And whatever you decide to do
in there today is not gonna change that.

01:47:45.132 --> 01:47:46.842
Would you mind giving me a minute?

01:47:50.554 --> 01:47:52.806
Should I be jealous
you get to testify first?

01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:53.974
No, man.

01:47:54.808 --> 01:47:57.895
I'm just a warm-up act
for the criminal mastermind to follow.

01:47:59.146 --> 01:48:00.898
Well, they gonna be disappointed as hell

01:48:00.981 --> 01:48:02.983
because I plan to
blame all this shit on you.

01:48:03.066 --> 01:48:05.152
Damn. That was my plan too.

01:48:07.529 --> 01:48:09.406
You know, when I first laid eyes on you,

01:48:09.489 --> 01:48:12.951
I thought you were this uptight,
square-ass Negro

01:48:13.035 --> 01:48:15.329
who wouldn't know
whitey's hand was 'round his neck

01:48:15.412 --> 01:48:17.039
if he was staring at it in a mirror.

01:48:18.332 --> 01:48:20.292
Glad I made such a good first impression.

01:48:21.835 --> 01:48:22.836
Turns out,

01:48:23.754 --> 01:48:25.589
you a goddamn revolutionary.

01:48:27.049 --> 01:48:28.634
You know, when I first met you,

01:48:29.426 --> 01:48:32.012
I thought you were
an entitled playboy clown.

01:48:34.056 --> 01:48:35.098
Man,

01:48:36.558 --> 01:48:40.145
you saw things years before I did.

01:48:41.647 --> 01:48:42.731
Even about myself,

01:48:45.692 --> 01:48:47.110
five minutes after meeting me.

01:49:11.969 --> 01:49:13.720
[gavel raps]

01:49:16.056 --> 01:49:18.517
[McClellan] Committee calls
Bernard S. Garrett to testify.

01:49:22.771 --> 01:49:25.107
Do you have his glasses?
He doesn't have his glasses.

01:49:25.190 --> 01:49:26.358
He doesn't need 'em.

01:49:26.859 --> 01:49:28.569
He's got to read his opening statement.

01:49:29.069 --> 01:49:31.864
He doesn't need his glasses. He never has.

01:49:34.449 --> 01:49:37.494
Mr. Garrett,
I think you understand the stakes.

01:49:41.915 --> 01:49:43.250
We'll take your statement now.

01:49:44.835 --> 01:49:45.919
Mr. Chairman.

01:49:46.795 --> 01:49:51.675
Our nation's founding documents declare
that "all men are created equal"

01:49:52.301 --> 01:49:54.052
and endeavor to create a society

01:49:54.136 --> 01:49:57.264
where citizens receive
the equal protection of our laws.

01:49:57.931 --> 01:49:59.057
It's a noble goal.

01:50:00.058 --> 01:50:03.604
But we all know,
for many citizens it's a lie.

01:50:03.687 --> 01:50:05.731
[chattering]

01:50:05.814 --> 01:50:07.232
This hearing is supposed to be

01:50:07.316 --> 01:50:12.863
about uncovering and reforming
unsafe banking practices.

01:50:13.697 --> 01:50:14.907
But I think it's really about

01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:19.912
how on Earth did two black men
pull off owning a bank in Texas.

01:50:19.995 --> 01:50:23.457
Mr. Garrett, I think you
should tread carefully now.

01:50:25.083 --> 01:50:27.044
Well, I can talk at length about that.

01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:30.839
Or I can sum it up with this.

01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:34.800
The dress code.

01:50:35.344 --> 01:50:37.137
Mr. Garrett, you are out of order, sir.

01:50:37.221 --> 01:50:38.639
- I'm not finished.
- Out of order.

01:50:38.722 --> 01:50:41.558
If you can't get a loan,
you can't own a home.

01:50:41.642 --> 01:50:42.722
You can't start a business.

01:50:42.768 --> 01:50:44.269
Mr. Garrett, you have been warned.

01:50:44.353 --> 01:50:46.980
- Which means you can't build wealth.
- Mr. Garrett!

01:50:47.064 --> 01:50:48.982
And you're excluded
from the American dream.

01:50:49.066 --> 01:50:50.692
Sergeant-at-arms, remove the witness.

01:50:50.776 --> 01:50:55.030
Why is it so important to you
to exclude an entire race of people

01:50:55.113 --> 01:50:56.657
from the American dream?

01:50:57.908 --> 01:50:59.535
[gavel rapping]

01:51:55.507 --> 01:51:57.926
- [buzzer sounds]
- [bell rings]

01:52:15.777 --> 01:52:17.654
Figures they'd let you out before me.

01:52:17.738 --> 01:52:19.948
Man, they couldn't wait
to get rid of my ass.

01:52:21.575 --> 01:52:23.577
- [Eunice chuckles, squeals]
- [Bernard] Oh.

01:52:25.412 --> 01:52:26.622
Let's go home.

01:52:28.457 --> 01:52:30.876
- They took 'em all, remember?
- Well, let's go somewhere.

01:52:30.959 --> 01:52:32.920
- [car door closes]
- [chuckles]

01:52:34.630 --> 01:52:36.048
What are you two laughing about?

01:52:36.131 --> 01:52:37.382
They didn't take all of 'em.

01:52:37.466 --> 01:52:40.219
They didn't know about the two
we bought next door to each other

01:52:40.302 --> 01:52:41.303
in the Bahamas.

01:52:41.386 --> 01:52:42.386
What?

01:52:43.514 --> 01:52:44.973
Bernard, how did you do that?

01:52:47.601 --> 01:52:49.978
[Bernard] <i>Matt called me
the night before he testified.</i>

01:52:51.313 --> 01:52:52.606
<i>He was pretty broken up.</i>

01:52:59.196 --> 01:53:00.739
[line ringing]

01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:02.741
<i>Hello?</i>

01:53:03.367 --> 01:53:04.368
It's Matt.

01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:07.621
Can we talk?

01:53:08.872 --> 01:53:11.416
[Bernard] <i>He told me
he was facing 50 years in prison</i>

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:13.710
<i>if he didn't say
what they wanted him to say.</i>

01:53:15.295 --> 01:53:17.297
<i>I told him to do what he had to do,</i>

01:53:18.841 --> 01:53:21.552
<i>but since the government
hadn't taken all of our money yet,</i>

01:53:25.639 --> 01:53:27.140
I asked him to do me a favor.

01:53:30.269 --> 01:53:32.354
- [coos]
- [car engine starts]

01:53:42.698 --> 01:53:45.200
["A Place in the Sun"
by Stevie Wonder playing]

01:54:22.696 --> 01:54:24.198
[song continues]

01:56:13.473 --> 01:56:16.226
[song fades]
