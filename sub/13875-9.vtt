that's my rum!

07:42.810 --> 07:44.640
You don't have to pour it down
the sink, man.

07:44.710 --> 07:46.800
We're gonna do it together,
right, Burt?

07:46.880 --> 07:49.540
You don't have a monkey
wrench, do you?

07:49.610 --> 07:51.640
Burt, l know what you're
thinking, and...

07:51.710 --> 07:52.540
What?

07:52.620 --> 07:56.070
l'm not going to dismantle the
pipes and drink from the U trap.

07:56.150 --> 07:58.120
l mean, that's what an animal does.

07:58.190 --> 08:00.250
Damn it, Mortimer,
you're diluting it!

08:00.320 --> 08:01.150
Come here, honey.

08:01.220 --> 08:02.520
Hold me. Hold me tight.

08:02.590 --> 08:03.990
Let's pray till it passes.

08:04.060 --> 08:05.690
Pray till it passes.

08:05.760 --> 08:10.260
And we'll just pray until the
doves erupt from our chests

08:10.330 --> 08:11.890
and fly into the sun.

08:11.970 --> 08:13.900
Yes.

08:13.970 --> 08:15.900
Bow your heads.

08:15.970 --> 08:20.740
Both:
[ speaking in tongues ]

08:20.810 --> 08:24.840
Okay, nice to meet
y'all and your special language.

08:24.910 --> 08:27.080
- l got to run.
- Wait, Meatwad, don't go!

08:27.150 --> 08:28.210
l gots to, boy.

08:28.280 --> 08:29.180
This ain't my problem.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.740
Listen to that.

08:31.820 --> 08:34.350
Uh, is he always like this?

08:34.419 --> 08:36.320
Jesus gives people obstacles

08:36.390 --> 08:40.450
to make them stronger so that
they can win.

08:40.530 --> 08:42.659
He plays a beautiful
trick on us.

08:42.730 --> 08:43.760
Yeah...

08:43.830 --> 08:45.930
So, you said you're into science?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.300
That's --
that's kind of like my job.

08:48.370 --> 08:49.800
l work in a cereal factory.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.620
Get out of my way,
you orange whore!

08:52.620 --> 08:53.520
Hold that thought.

08:53.520 --> 08:54.390
[ crash! ]

08:56.410 --> 08:57.240
Stupid!

08:57.310 --> 09:00.150
Someone unscrew these pipes or
l will shoot myself tonight.

09:00.220 --> 09:01.440
l will do it this time.

09:01.520 --> 09:03.450
No, honey, don't!

09:03.520 --> 09:04.450
Don't worry.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.450
This happens...

09:05.520 --> 09:07.080
- Damn it!
- ...a lot.

09:07.160 --> 09:08.020
l mean, l have his gun.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.960
- Son of a...!
- No, honey, don't.

09:10.030 --> 09:12.620
Useless surgically attached
banana hands.

09:12.700 --> 09:13.960
l am so sorry.

09:14.030 --> 09:16.020
We're not normally like this.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.900
Okay, all right, l see.

09:17.970 --> 09:20.630
And now you want to have sex
with the fries, is that it?

09:20.700 --> 09:22.030
Yeah, tell him some more lies.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.330
That's what you're good at.

09:23.410 --> 09:24.840
Lies from the wolf!

09:24.910 --> 09:25.930
l'm sorry, Burt.

09:26.010 --> 09:27.240
Yes, you are.

09:27.310 --> 09:29.570
A sorry sack of tangerine bitch.

09:29.650 --> 09:30.740
Go do him.

09:30.810 --> 09:32.010
l'll watch.

09:32.080 --> 09:35.050
Do it before thine eyes!

09:35.120 --> 09:36.710
Oh, Burt, please don't hit me!

09:36.790 --> 09:39.310
Then get the liquor faster.

09:39.390 --> 09:41.380
Well, y'all make
yourself at home.

09:41.460 --> 09:42.390
l need to go get some, uh...

09:42.460 --> 09:44.260
Son of a--
Damn it!

09:44.330 --> 09:45.790
Aw [burp] it,
l just need to go.

09:45.860 --> 09:48.760
BURT:
Come on, give me just a
little bit of that booger sugar.

09:48.830 --> 09:49.760
Burt, no, you can't.

09:49.830 --> 09:51.700
l'll make you feel real good
with my mouth.

09:51.770 --> 09:52.760
Burt, calm down, Burt.

09:52.840 --> 09:55.130
BURT:
l will not calm down until
cocaine enters my system!

09:55.200 --> 09:57.200
Check it out --
the ultimate king.

09:57.270 --> 09:59.300
Burt, you don't want to do
this right now.

09:59.380 --> 10:00.340
BURT:
Do you have some?

10:00.410 --> 10:02.270
MORTlMER:
No, it is the devil.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.870
Burt, listen to me.

10:03.950 --> 10:05.310
BURT:
You've had some this whole time.

10:05.380 --> 10:06.940
MORTlMER:
l have not touched cocaine in
three years.

10:07.020 --> 10:07.850
BURT:
You liar!

10:07.920 --> 10:10.350
l will drag you right into my
private hell.

10:10.420 --> 10:12.080
You don't want to know my pain.

10:12.150 --> 10:15.120
l have a demon inside of me!

10:15.190 --> 10:16.450
[ whip! ]
[ clank! clank! ]

10:16.530 --> 10:18.960
Maybe we should just get him
a little bit.

10:19.030 --> 10:20.830
Oh, good, you're still here.

10:20.900 --> 10:25.090
So, wow, so, before, you
mentioned you were into science.

10:25.170 --> 10:26.160
Yeah, man.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.600
Yeah, that must be a fun job.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.660
Look, l don't have any cocaine.

10:29.740 --> 10:31.760
l was not going to ask you
for cocaine, sir.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.930
Good, then l don't
have to answer it.

10:34.010 --> 10:36.000
Well, l mean,
l used to be an addict.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.570
l mean, it was terrible.

10:37.650 --> 10:38.700
Do you see this?

10:38.780 --> 10:43.080
l was building a birdhouse on drugs,
and l lost two fingers.

10:43.150 --> 10:45.750
l feverishly wanted
to finish it,

10:45.820 --> 10:47.350
and l wasn't making sound
decisions.

10:47.420 --> 10:50.050
Remember my roommate,
the cup you met earlier?

10:50.130 --> 10:51.350
He's filled with crystal meth.

10:51.430 --> 10:52.890
Oh, cool. Thanks.

10:52.960 --> 10:53.990
Everybody split up.

10:54.060 --> 10:55.290
We have to find the cup.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.660
- The cup has the drugs.
- The cup.

10:56.730 --> 10:58.060
There's crystal meth
in the cup.

10:58.130 --> 10:59.600
- Filled with magic.
- l saw the cup.

10:59.670 --> 11:00.690
lt's in the back. Go after it!

11:00.770 --> 11:02.400
Alright, so how do l do it now?

11:02.470 --> 11:03.460
FRYLOCK:
Are you grounded?

11:03.540 --> 11:04.400
- Yep.
- Okay, good.

11:04.470 --> 11:06.240
Now, touch the red wire
to the green wire.

11:06.310 --> 11:08.240
Okay, but what --
what about Shake?

11:08.310 --> 11:09.370
FRYLOCK:
What about him?

11:09.450 --> 11:11.280
That's what l said, yo.

11:11.350 --> 11:12.680
Bah-bah-boom!

11:12.820 --> 11:13.910
Dancing is forbidden

11:14.680 --> 11:16.550
D-d-dancing is forbidden

11:17.920 --> 11:19.320
Dancing is forbidden

11:20.190 --> 11:22.020
D-d-dancing is forbidden

11:23.260 --> 11:24.780
D-d-dancing is forbidden
