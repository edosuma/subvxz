Do you consent?

Yes, sir. Sure.

It is... 9:35 p.m.,
September 8, 2019.

09:00.629 --> 09:02.087
Initiated traffic stop.

09:02.170 --> 09:03.712
How are you tonight, sir?

09:04.379 --> 09:07.379
Good. Yeah, fine.
Thanks.

09:07.462 --> 09:10.253
-How are you?
-What you drinking there?

09:10.962 --> 09:12.671
Oh, uh...

Coca-Cola, sir.

Mm.

09:16.671 --> 09:18.253
What are you hauling?

09:19.295 --> 09:21.087
Lettuce.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.879
Lettuce?

09:24.337 --> 09:26.837
-Yes, sir.
-Can I take a look?

09:27.837 --> 09:29.921
Can I take a look
at your face? (snickers)

09:31.504 --> 09:33.504
What did you just say to me?

09:34.504 --> 09:36.962
Hey, I'm-I'm sorry, officer.

09:37.045 --> 09:40.629
-I was just kidding.
-License and registration.

09:44.921 --> 09:46.462
They're in the glove.

09:47.045 --> 09:50.003
I'm just gonna reach over
and open it on up, okay?

09:51.337 --> 09:53.045

Shit. No, wait.
Is there anyone else--

10:26.962 --> 10:28.879
Panda (on radio):
This is Panda. What's up?

10:31.879 --> 10:33.420
Hey, I just made
a traffic stop.

10:33.504 --> 10:35.128
Subject refused
a search of his truck,

10:35.212 --> 10:38.337
and I observed Kavalry
contraband in his glove.

10:40.587 --> 10:42.671
Requesting firearm
lock release.

10:42.754 --> 10:44.921
What kind of contraband?

10:45.879 --> 10:48.128
It was a Rorschach mask.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.587
Are you sure?

10:49.671 --> 10:52.545
I saw it.
Panda, come on.

10:52.629 --> 10:53.587
Release my weapon.

and/or explosives

11:01.420 --> 11:04.253

-High.

11:04.337 --> 11:07.671
What's your overall perceived
threat level from the subject?

11:07.754 --> 11:11.671
High. Just... buzz me, okay?

11:11.754 --> 11:13.087
Stand by.

11:14.087 --> 11:15.921

11:17.629 --> 11:19.170

-Nurse: Of course, sir.

14:08.629 --> 14:10.671
You running background checks
on all the nurses

14:10.754 --> 14:12.629
and orderlies
that saw his face?

14:12.712 --> 14:13.796
Yep.

14:23.504 --> 14:26.003
We got roadblocks up
on all the egresses,

14:26.087 --> 14:28.337
but he's probably
gone to ground.

14:29.087 --> 14:31.962
Sent a couple units out
to the address on his DL,

14:32.045 --> 14:34.253
but the house was boarded up.

14:38.087 --> 14:40.796
-Kavalry?
-More than likely.

14:42.128 --> 14:44.545
You want me to call in
Red and Night?

14:44.629 --> 14:46.003
No.

14:47.462 --> 14:48.545
(sighs)

14:48.629 --> 14:49.837
Let 'em sleep.

14:49.921 --> 14:52.003
She gonna be pissed.

14:52.087 --> 14:56.212
Why in Christ's name would
they start this shit up again?

14:56.295 --> 14:58.003
Maybe there was
somethin' in the truck

14:58.087 --> 14:59.962
they didn't want found.

15:00.045 --> 15:01.295
Somethin' like what?

15:01.379 --> 15:04.087
There was a head of lettuce
in Sutton's car.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.337
Shooter must've tossed it in.

15:06.420 --> 15:08.504
I believe it was romaine.

15:10.128 --> 15:12.253
Were there any croutons?

15:13.504 --> 15:15.754
Not that I could ascertain.

15:17.462 --> 15:21.420
You don't start a war
over goddamn lettuce, Wade.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.962
Come over here
and pull your face down.

16:12.629 --> 16:14.045
Mrs. Sutton?

16:15.212 --> 16:16.754
Roberta.

16:17.837 --> 16:20.545
Roberta, I'm Judd.

16:21.587 --> 16:23.170
May I come in?

16:24.712 --> 16:26.337
(whispers):
Yeah.

16:29.087 --> 16:31.087
There was a shooting.

16:31.170 --> 16:32.921
Charlie's in surgery now.

16:33.587 --> 16:35.045
When he's out,
we're gonna move him

16:35.128 --> 16:38.462
to our secure medical facility
over at the precinct.

16:38.545 --> 16:41.003
Ah. Okay.

16:42.253 --> 16:43.879
Can I go see him?

16:43.962 --> 16:45.587
Of course.

16:51.253 --> 16:53.754
Did he tell anyone
that he was police?

16:54.837 --> 16:56.796
That's against the rules.

16:56.879 --> 16:58.212
Yeah.

16:59.587 --> 17:01.420
But people still talk.

17:04.879 --> 17:06.420
He didn't.

17:09.712 --> 17:12.921
Where did he tell folks
that he was going
when he was on shift?

17:13.003 --> 17:16.462
Night school, for engineering.

17:17.504 --> 17:18.712
All right.

17:19.837 --> 17:21.962
We'll say it was a carjacking.

17:22.045 --> 17:25.003
He was leaving school
and that's when he got shot.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.504
Why?

17:26.587 --> 17:28.837
We have protocols.

17:28.921 --> 17:30.962
We just want to keep
everybody safe.

17:31.504 --> 17:33.128
Safe. (scoffs)

17:33.671 --> 17:36.337
-Yeah, I know
what you're thinkin'.
-Mm-hmm.

17:36.420 --> 17:39.087
Fuck me and the horse
I rode in on.

17:41.504 --> 17:43.504
He liked you.

17:45.212 --> 17:47.420
No. He likes me.

17:59.337 --> 18:01.170
Woman:
Egg whites are
made of protein.

18:01.253 --> 18:03.629
When we whip 'em,
we get bubbles,

18:03.712 --> 18:07.128
and it's the proteins that form
the walls of those bubbles.

18:07.212 --> 18:11.837
If we don't have walls,
it all comes tumblin' down.

18:16.170 --> 18:20.962
Now, those walls are strong,
but they won't stay that way

18:21.045 --> 18:23.921
if just even
a little bit of yolk

18:24.003 --> 18:26.420
gets mixed in
with the whites.

18:26.504 --> 18:30.837
So, that's why
we gotta separate 'em.

18:33.337 --> 18:37.420
-Ta-da!
-Kids: Wow!

18:37.504 --> 18:40.420
Boy: Can we eat
our cookies now,
please?

18:40.504 --> 18:42.045
Y'all go ahead.

18:44.796 --> 18:47.629
Teacher:
Okay, Ms. Abar, while they're
stuffing their faces,

18:47.712 --> 18:50.420
maybe you can explain to them
what they're eating.

18:51.087 --> 18:52.879
Ms. Abar:
Oh, um...

18:53.545 --> 18:56.212
It's called a banh bia.

18:56.295 --> 18:59.504
When I was
a little girl in Vietnam,

18:59.587 --> 19:01.587
we called them "mooncakes."

19:01.671 --> 19:05.837
Oh, were you born
there before or after
it became a state?

19:05.921 --> 19:09.212
Um, a couple years before.

19:11.379 --> 19:15.253
Um, I was born
just outside of Saigon

19:15.337 --> 19:18.295
and when I grew up,
I was a police officer there

19:18.379 --> 19:20.754
until I moved here to Tulsa.

19:20.837 --> 19:22.087
Did you stay
a police officer?

19:22.170 --> 19:25.128
For a while,
then I retired.

19:25.212 --> 19:26.545
Boy: Why?

19:28.420 --> 19:29.671
Um...

19:31.337 --> 19:35.754
I was one of the cops who got
attacked on the White Night.

19:36.420 --> 19:41.003
And that was before
police officers were
allowed to wear masks.

19:41.087 --> 19:43.837
So, the bad guys,
they knew who I was

19:43.921 --> 19:45.837
and they knew where I lived,

19:45.921 --> 19:48.671
and they came to my house
and they shot me.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.003
Right here.

19:50.087 --> 19:52.712
And the doctors,
they had to pull apart
my insides

19:52.796 --> 19:55.128
to find the bullet
and get it out

19:55.212 --> 19:57.671
-'cause they didn't want it to--
-Ahem.

19:57.754 --> 20:01.379
Oh, um, anyway.

20:01.962 --> 20:04.170
I figured making
cakes and cookies

20:04.253 --> 20:06.420
was better than getting shot.

20:07.170 --> 20:12.087
So, I quit the police force
and opened up a bakery.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.671
Mm-hmm?

20:14.754 --> 20:16.962
Did Redfordations pay for it?

20:18.462 --> 20:20.128
Excuse me?

20:21.170 --> 20:24.629
Your bakery-- did you pay
for it with Redfordations?

20:24.712 --> 20:25.754
Tommy!

20:25.837 --> 20:27.587
-(boy yells)
-(kids chattering excitedly)

20:27.671 --> 20:28.962
Ooh! Topher!

20:36.962 --> 20:40.462
Don't tilt your head back,
just pinch your nose.

20:43.379 --> 20:44.962
Why'd you hit him?

20:46.212 --> 20:48.212
'Cause you wanted
to hit him.

20:48.295 --> 20:50.337
He's ten years old.

20:51.170 --> 20:53.087
You still wanted to.

20:54.504 --> 20:57.003
He said...
Redfordations.

20:57.087 --> 20:58.712
I heard him.

21:00.629 --> 21:04.045
-He's a racist.
-He's not racist.

21:04.128 --> 21:06.337
But he's off
to a good start.

21:08.837 --> 21:11.462
(siren wailing)

21:11.545 --> 21:13.295
Oh, goddammit.

21:14.337 --> 21:16.712
(siren continuing)

21:28.170 --> 21:30.712
-Maybe it's a false--

22:54.420 --> 22:57.420
Hey, you left your pager.
It's been going off all morning.

23:03.796 --> 23:05.671
What's Little Big Horn?

23:06.629 --> 23:08.796
I gotta go to the bakery.

23:09.754 --> 23:11.212
You pick up Rosie from school?

23:11.295 --> 23:12.629
Of course.

23:14.337 --> 23:16.545
Sweetie, I need you
to go with Dad

23:16.629 --> 23:18.671
and pick up your sister
from school, okay?

23:18.754 --> 23:20.504
Don't let him drive too fast.

-Love you too, Mommy.

23:25.879 --> 23:27.212
I also love you.

23:27.295 --> 23:28.712
Don't drive fast.

23:28.796 --> 23:30.545
No TV!

23:30.629 --> 23:32.545
Man (over blimp PA):
The clock is ticking.

23:32.629 --> 23:34.045
The New York Times
is calling it

23:34.128 --> 23:37.629
the most important television
event of the new millennium.

23:37.712 --> 23:40.379
Tomorrow night,
the countdown ends.

23:40.462 --> 23:43.671
American Hero Story:
Minutemen.

24:10.379 --> 24:13.128
-Do you own that place?
-Mm-hmm.

24:14.045 --> 24:16.754
-When is gonna open?
-A couple months.

24:16.837 --> 24:18.170
Mm-hmm.

24:19.212 --> 24:20.587
I'll wait.

24:20.671 --> 24:21.837
Hey.

24:23.170 --> 24:26.045
You think I can lift 200 pounds?

24:28.462 --> 24:30.420
Sure you could.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.921
(keypad beeping)

25:33.087 --> 25:35.212
(dogs barking)

25:44.212 --> 25:45.504
Whoa! Hey!

25:45.587 --> 25:47.796
(tires screech)

26:08.587 --> 26:11.671
Man (in distorted voice):
Cop carcass on the highway
last night.

26:11.754 --> 26:16.128
Soon, the accumulated black
filth will be hosed away,

26:16.212 --> 26:19.962
and the streets of Tulsa
will turn into extended gutters

26:20.045 --> 26:22.504
overflowing with liberal tears.

26:22.587 --> 26:27.671
Soon all the whores
and race traitors
will shout "Save us!"

26:27.754 --> 26:31.504
And we will whisper... No.

26:33.212 --> 26:36.128
We are the Seventh Kavalry.

26:36.212 --> 26:41.754
We are no one.
We are everyone.
We are invisible.

26:41.837 --> 26:44.295
And we will never compromise.

26:44.379 --> 26:48.212
Do not stand between
us and our mission,

26:48.295 --> 26:51.045
or there will be
more dead cops.

26:51.128 --> 26:54.128
There are so many
deserving of retribution

26:54.212 --> 26:56.629
and there is so little time.

26:56.712 --> 27:00.462
And that time is near.

27:01.504 --> 27:06.754
Ticktock.Ticktock.
Ticktock. Ticktock.

27:06.837 --> 27:12.337
Kalvarymen (chanting):
Ticktock.Ticktock.
Ticktock. Ticktock.

27:12.420 --> 27:15.629
Ticktock.Ticktock.
Ticktock. Ticktock.

27:15.712 --> 27:18.337
(chanting grows louder, faster):
Ticktock.Ticktock.
Ticktock. Ticktock.

27:18.420 --> 27:21.295
Ticktock! Ticktock!
Ticktock! Ticktock!

27:21.379 --> 27:24.796
Ticktock! Ticktock!
Ticktock! Ticktock!

27:24.879 --> 27:26.796
(chanting stops)

27:26.879 --> 27:28.462
Kavalry's back.

27:28.545 --> 27:31.212
(murmuring)

27:32.379 --> 27:34.420
Three years of peace,

27:34.504 --> 27:37.420
and we convinced ourselves
that they were gone.

27:38.379 --> 27:40.379
But they were just hibernating.

27:41.545 --> 27:43.253
Good thing we know
where their caves are.

27:43.337 --> 27:45.128
(murmuring assent)

27:45.212 --> 27:47.295
So roll into Nixonville
and round 'em up,

27:47.379 --> 27:50.379
and drag their asses
into the pod for interrogation.

27:50.462 --> 27:51.962
One of them's gonna
give up the shooter.

27:52.045 --> 27:54.337
Pirate Jenny:
Warrants-free, weapons hot?

27:54.420 --> 27:56.962
We are Article Four.

27:57.629 --> 27:59.587
Panda, buzz out the guns.

28:00.295 --> 28:02.587
(crowd groaning)

28:03.253 --> 28:07.253
"An emergency 24-hour
release of deadly weapons

28:07.337 --> 28:09.170
-"can be authorized only...
-Shut the fuck up, Panda.

28:09.253 --> 28:12.003
"...if the majority
of the police force

28:12.087 --> 28:15.962
believe their lives are under
direct immediate threat."

28:16.045 --> 28:17.587
LG...

28:18.671 --> 28:22.170
do you believe
your life is under direct
and immediate threat?

28:22.253 --> 28:23.587
Yes, I do.

28:23.671 --> 28:25.712
What about you, Red?

28:26.587 --> 28:28.045
Absolutely.

28:28.128 --> 28:29.879
(crowd assenting)

28:31.754 --> 28:34.253
Firearms release is authorized.

28:34.337 --> 28:38.087
-(applauding)
-Chief, you're making a mistake.

28:38.170 --> 28:39.962
Yeah, well...

28:40.962 --> 28:42.837
it's my funeral.

28:43.671 --> 28:46.629
Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?

28:47.629 --> 28:49.629
All:
Nos costodimus!

28:52.587 --> 28:57.087
(indistinct chattering)

29:02.962 --> 29:04.796
Angela:
Why didn't you call me?

29:08.462 --> 29:10.337
Wanna take your feet
off my desk, please?

29:10.420 --> 29:13.379
Kavalry involved
shooting last night,

29:13.462 --> 29:16.504
and I don't get
a Little Big Horn
until two hours ago?

29:16.587 --> 29:18.462
We were still
working the scene.
It was late.

29:18.545 --> 29:21.504
Mm. I know why
you didn't call me.

29:23.170 --> 29:24.337
Why?

29:25.128 --> 29:27.420
You were mad
that my sitter bailed

29:27.504 --> 29:29.420
and you had to suffer
through black Oklahoma

29:29.504 --> 29:31.796
without having someone
to roll your eyes at.

29:31.879 --> 29:35.003
-Sitter bailed?
-Yes.

29:35.087 --> 29:37.837
Well, you and Cal missed out,

29:37.921 --> 29:41.045
because black Oklahoma
was delightful.

29:41.128 --> 29:43.087
You are not allowed
to call it that.

29:43.170 --> 29:44.796
You gonna give me
the speech now?

29:44.879 --> 29:46.420
What speech?

29:46.504 --> 29:50.128
About how I'm overreacting
by calling Article Four,

29:50.212 --> 29:54.295
and I should calm down
and take a breath
before we're at war again.

29:54.379 --> 29:56.045
There's a guy in my trunk.

29:59.962 --> 30:02.754
I knew you were gonna tell us
to round up the likelies.

30:02.837 --> 30:05.087
I just got a jump on things.

30:08.170 --> 30:09.504
You knew?

30:10.545 --> 30:11.879
Yes.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.087
How do you know he's Seven K?

30:16.253 --> 30:20.504
I got a nose
for white supremacy,
and he smells like bleach.

30:23.253 --> 30:26.420
So, put him in the pod?

30:31.087 --> 30:32.921
Put him in the pod.

30:57.837 --> 30:59.087
Howdy.

31:00.170 --> 31:02.837
I'm just gonna ask you
a series of questions.

31:02.921 --> 31:06.253
Answer them honestly
and you can go home.

31:11.545 --> 31:13.629
Do you know
why you're here?

31:13.712 --> 31:16.087
Some bitch
dressed like a nun

31:16.170 --> 31:19.003
kicked in my door
and put me in the trunk
of her fucking car.

31:19.087 --> 31:21.128
That is correct.

31:22.462 --> 31:24.087
I want my lawyer.

31:24.170 --> 31:27.921
Looking Glass:
Yeah, we really don't have
to do that with terrorists.

31:28.003 --> 31:29.879
I-- I'm not a terrorist.

31:29.962 --> 31:32.087
(whirring)

31:37.587 --> 31:39.754
How long have
you lived in Tulsa?

31:40.754 --> 31:43.337
(whirring)

31:44.921 --> 31:49.045
Uh, five years-- six.
Almost six.

31:49.462 --> 31:52.128
What did you have
for breakfast this morning?

31:53.671 --> 31:55.712
Cereal, I think.

31:56.212 --> 31:58.462
If I defecated
on the American flag,

31:58.545 --> 32:00.504
how would that make you feel?

32:01.128 --> 32:02.295
Defecated?

32:02.379 --> 32:06.921
Shit.If I took a shit
on the American flag,

32:07.003 --> 32:09.671
how would that make you feel?

32:10.921 --> 32:12.504
Confused.

32:13.170 --> 32:16.087
Are you a member of
or do you associate with

32:16.170 --> 32:18.754
members of the white
supremacist organization

32:18.837 --> 32:21.045
known as the Seventh Kavalry?

32:22.587 --> 32:23.962
No.

32:24.837 --> 32:27.253
Do you believe that
transdimensional attacks

32:27.337 --> 32:31.128
are hoaxes staged
by the U.S. government?

32:31.837 --> 32:32.962
I dunno, maybe.

32:33.045 --> 32:35.754
Are you a member of
or do you associate with

32:35.837 --> 32:38.587
members of the white
supremacist organization

32:38.671 --> 32:40.671
known as the Seventh Kavalry?

32:40.754 --> 32:42.087
You already asked me that.

32:42.170 --> 32:44.962
-Should all Americans pay taxes?
-Yes.

32:45.045 --> 32:47.295
Are you a member of
or do you associate with

32:47.379 --> 32:49.712
members of the white
supremacist organization

32:49.796 --> 32:51.170
known as the Seventh Kavalry?

32:51.253 --> 32:53.796
Are you a member of
or do you associate with

32:53.879 --> 32:56.087
members of the white
supremacist organization

32:56.170 --> 32:57.295
known as the Seventh Kavalry?

32:57.379 --> 32:59.921
Are you a member of
or do you associate with

33:00.003 --> 33:02.087
members of the white
supremacist group

33:02.170 --> 33:03.587
known as the Seventh Kavalry?

33:03.671 --> 33:06.420
No... No.

33:13.545 --> 33:16.587
(whirring)

33:33.754 --> 33:35.128
Angela: Well?

33:37.253 --> 33:38.796
He knows.

33:38.879 --> 33:40.337
You sure?

33:40.420 --> 33:43.337
He's not gonna talk
sans motivation,

33:43.420 --> 33:46.170
but he was off the charts
on the bias questions.

33:46.253 --> 33:49.379
Eyes dilated
on all the Rorschachs.

33:49.462 --> 33:51.754
Yeah. I'm sure.

33:54.379 --> 33:55.879
Like I said...

33:57.087 --> 33:58.587
bleach.

34:06.587 --> 34:12.170
Angela:
Cop got shot, so we're
all a little wound up here.

34:13.629 --> 34:17.587
But still that's no excuse
for how I treated you.

34:18.921 --> 34:20.170
Sorry.

34:21.337 --> 34:23.170
Yeah, okay.

34:23.253 --> 34:25.170
Appreciate
your understanding.

34:25.921 --> 34:28.295
(screams, grunts)

34:28.379 --> 34:30.462
Fuck!

34:31.545 --> 34:32.837
Fuck you!

34:32.921 --> 34:35.879
-(blows thudding)
-Angela: Where... is... he?

34:35.962 --> 34:37.587
-Where is he?!
-(man screaming)

34:37.671 --> 34:39.921
-Where... is... he?!
-(blows thudding)

34:42.671 --> 34:46.128
-(man shouting, screaming)
-Where is he?!

34:48.504 --> 34:50.712
-Where is he?!
-(blows thudding)

34:50.796 --> 34:52.754
-Where is he?!
-(thuds)

34:52.837 --> 34:55.003
(man groans)

35:03.337 --> 35:05.337
(panting)

35:06.170 --> 35:07.504
Cattle ranch.

35:43.170 --> 35:47.337
Sister Night:
We're almost at the house.
Is there any movement inside?

35:47.420 --> 35:49.754
Night (over radio):
Do you got a head count?

35:52.045 --> 35:53.295
Looks like four.

35:53.379 --> 35:54.712
Crawford (over radio):
Maybe five.

36:09.796 --> 36:11.337
(alarm buzzing)

36:11.420 --> 36:13.212
Cops! Pack it up! Let's go!

36:14.170 --> 36:15.754
Let's head on out! Come on!

36:16.629 --> 36:18.170
Aw, shit! They're moving!

Woman: All right.
Come on, boys, let's go!

Two of them got out.

39:48.462 --> 39:51.420
They're taking off.

All right. Bring her out.

Stay with 'em.

Higher.

40:30.212 --> 40:31.337

-I'm trying!

-Thank you, Alphonse.

43:17.796 --> 43:20.253
Your thighs are
quite raw, Master.

43:20.337 --> 43:23.295
Yes, I rode quite
a distance yesterday.

43:24.295 --> 43:26.045
But don't worry,
Ms. Crookshanks.

Philips: Sir.

43:35.087 --> 43:36.253
Shall I dress you?

43:36.337 --> 43:39.212
Looks a little formal,
Mr. Philips.

43:39.295 --> 43:43.003
-Is it a special occasion?
-Of course it is, Master.

43:45.337 --> 43:47.045
It's your anniversary.

44:12.379 --> 44:13.545
Ah.

44:15.379 --> 44:17.712
Would you like
to cut it, sir?

44:21.087 --> 44:24.420
That is a horseshoe,
Mr. Philips.

44:26.587 --> 44:28.462
I'm so sorry, sir.

44:28.545 --> 44:31.629
-Would a knife
be more appropriate?
-No, it's...

44:31.712 --> 44:33.379
It's all right.

44:44.420 --> 44:46.712
It's the bee's knees.

You had discarded
some drawings of it, sir.

45:20.045 --> 45:22.796
The pieces were most intricate.

to get it to function.

I...

45:30.921 --> 45:33.671
wanted to surprise you, sir.

45:36.420 --> 45:38.921
It's exquisite, Mr. Philips.

45:40.295 --> 45:45.003
Speaking of surprises,
I have a surprise for you.

45:46.212 --> 45:48.462
I've started writing a play.

45:48.962 --> 45:52.295
It's a tragedy
in five acts.

45:53.879 --> 45:58.504
When it's finished,
I want the two of you...

Jane:
Alas, as wonderful

I've quit politics.

She was a policeman.

I retired.

Yeah, there's always a chance
of reprisal, Governor,

-You sounded very confident.

I am full of confidence.
