Bran and Toby certainly have

02:49.482 --> 02:51.252
their hands full with the

02:51.285 --> 02:54.826
quirky owners and decor
of this mixed-up mansion.

02:54.860 --> 02:58.601
All right, guys, so little bit
of a hiccup out the gates.

02:58.634 --> 03:00.571
My brother Toby's
a little under the weather,

03:00.605 --> 03:02.341
so he's gonna sit this one out.

03:02.374 --> 03:04.679
I mean, typical Toby, right?

03:04.713 --> 03:07.351
Leaving all the hard work
for this guy to do.

03:07.384 --> 03:10.323
But when they saw
how down we were

03:10.357 --> 03:11.960
about Toby taking a sick day,

03:11.994 --> 03:13.531
the owners of this house--

03:13.564 --> 03:14.733
and I'm just gonna
say this about them--

03:14.766 --> 03:17.337
they are very spiritual people.

03:17.371 --> 03:20.377
They led me and the whole crew
on a very special

03:20.410 --> 03:23.851
guided meditation, you know,
just to re-center us.

03:23.884 --> 03:26.824
And you will forget
that Toby is dead,

03:26.857 --> 03:29.228
and that he was murdered by me.

03:29.261 --> 03:31.365
A girl has got to eat.

03:31.399 --> 03:32.902
And, instead, you will think

03:32.936 --> 03:35.875
that he is just
temporarily sick. (vocalizes)

03:35.908 --> 03:38.246
Hashtag it worked.

03:38.279 --> 03:39.649
So, now... (chuckles)

03:39.683 --> 03:41.587
...we got to get back
to the task at hand,

03:41.620 --> 03:43.824
and, oh, boy, it's a doozy.

03:43.858 --> 03:46.663
Plus, we just want Toby
to be proud of this episode

03:46.697 --> 03:49.703
when he sees it, after
he shakes off the mild flu.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.243
NARRATOR:
When the owners first saw this

03:53.276 --> 03:55.782
8,474-square-foot home,

03:55.815 --> 03:57.886
it was love at first sight.

03:57.919 --> 04:00.558
And that was so long ago,
they say

04:00.591 --> 04:02.428
they can't even remember
when they first moved in.

04:02.461 --> 04:04.833
But since then,
things have changed.

04:04.866 --> 04:07.572
Railroad employee
and part-time graphic designer,

04:11.547 --> 04:13.483

...hates living
in this dated house

04:13.517 --> 04:15.588
that lacks adequate storage
space for him and his nephew

04:15.621 --> 04:17.959
-Colin.
-(laughs) Bang!

04:17.992 --> 04:19.763
What have I told you
about touching my hat?

04:19.796 --> 04:21.265
-Pow!
-LASZLO: To be blunt,

04:21.299 --> 04:22.735
this house is a (bleep)hole.

04:22.769 --> 04:24.639
And I think only
Bran and Toby are capable

04:24.673 --> 04:26.844
of helping us
"embrace our space."

04:26.877 --> 04:29.348
-Go on, bugger off.
-LASZLO: To quote the brothers
themselves,

04:29.381 --> 04:30.985
from episode 113,

04:31.018 --> 04:32.789
"Midcentury Mess,"

04:32.822 --> 04:34.759
"This house is all kinds of

04:37.097 --> 04:39.603
(laughs)

04:39.636 --> 04:41.907
NARRATOR:
Nandor and Marwa are newlyweds

04:41.940 --> 04:43.677
with a passion for cooking,

04:43.711 --> 04:45.013
but without enough space

04:45.046 --> 04:46.717
-in their cramped kitchen.
-Sorry.

04:46.750 --> 04:48.954
And they can't seem
to agree on how to make

04:48.988 --> 04:51.359
their master bedroom
their happily ever after.

04:51.392 --> 04:54.398
So, yes, we are
technically newlyweds,

04:54.431 --> 04:57.572
but it feels like we've
been together forever.

04:57.605 --> 04:59.776
I would describe my style

04:59.810 --> 05:01.713
as French country

05:01.747 --> 05:02.782
meets shabby chic.

05:02.816 --> 05:05.487
And I would describe my style

05:05.521 --> 05:07.959
as French country
meets shabby chic.

05:07.992 --> 05:09.663
But I also like modern.

05:09.696 --> 05:11.767
I like to have an indoor sink,

05:11.800 --> 05:13.571
a floor that is not dirt.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.875
Me, too. I like everything
that he likes.

05:15.908 --> 05:17.512
So, if he says that
we need a change...

05:17.545 --> 05:19.415
Change is not always
a good thing.

05:19.448 --> 05:21.419
I mean, sometimes,
you make too many changes,

05:21.452 --> 05:22.822
and then, before you know it,

05:22.856 --> 05:24.593
you realize what
you thought you wanted

05:24.626 --> 05:26.697
is, in fact, very annoying.

05:28.901 --> 05:30.538

-Where is the (bleep) thing?

05:34.646 --> 05:36.850
NARRATOR:
...tensions can run hot.

05:36.884 --> 05:38.754
The thingy-thing. The thing
that controls... (stammers)

05:38.787 --> 05:40.791
-...the heat at the nightclub.
-GUILLERMO: A thermostat key.

05:40.825 --> 05:41.994
-Right?
-NADJA: Yes.

05:42.027 --> 05:43.731
It's on a chain
around your neck.

05:43.764 --> 05:46.503
Nice try.

05:46.537 --> 05:47.839
(clears throat)

05:47.872 --> 05:50.010
-Whew, this is a big house.
-Yeah.

05:50.043 --> 05:52.481
Okay, guys, let's talk about

05:52.515 --> 05:54.853
design options
within your budget.

05:54.886 --> 05:56.557
-Great.
-Now, here's the question:

05:56.590 --> 05:58.627
How much are you guys
comfortable spending

05:58.661 --> 06:00.397
in order to give
this old house a...

06:00.430 --> 06:01.900
(whistles)
...facelift?

06:01.934 --> 06:03.804
All of it.
All our life's savings.

06:03.837 --> 06:06.442
-Whatever you need,
you knucklehead.
-You're the knucklehead.

06:06.475 --> 06:08.446
-You're the (bleep) knucklehead.
-Who you calling a knucklehead?

06:08.479 --> 06:10.651
-(laughs)
-Look at this. (laughs)

06:10.685 --> 06:12.487
-Where'd you get that shirt?
-What?

06:12.522 --> 06:13.524
Where-Where'd you get
your shirt?

06:13.557 --> 06:15.126
From a shop. (bleep) off.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.663
BRAN:
Okay, we're getting
a little off track here.

06:16.697 --> 06:18.567
Let's focus, guys,
'cause, clearly,

06:18.601 --> 06:20.538
this living room
is not working for anyone.

06:20.571 --> 06:22.742
What the (bleep) is that
supposed to mean? Some of us

06:22.775 --> 06:24.613
happen to like
waterlogged mahogany

06:24.646 --> 06:26.449
and soaking wet pillows
that smell of cheese

06:26.482 --> 06:28.486
-and moldy stuffed bears.
Thank you.
-BRAN: Yeah...

06:28.520 --> 06:30.491
Clearly, we're not nuts
about the full-size tree

06:30.524 --> 06:32.160
that fell through
the wall. (chuckles)

06:32.194 --> 06:33.864
Left a gigantic hole

06:33.898 --> 06:35.735
where raccoons and squirrels
can just come and go

06:35.768 --> 06:37.639
and nest in our furniture, so...

06:37.672 --> 06:38.941
I don't know, I don't mind it.

06:38.974 --> 06:40.878
As you can see, I
gave that a bit of a trim

06:40.912 --> 06:43.617
using the Milwaukee M18 Fuel
Lithium-Ion chainsaw,

06:43.651 --> 06:45.554
used in your commercials.

06:45.588 --> 06:49.161
"Milwaukee,
nothing but heavy duty."

06:49.194 --> 06:50.831
(clicks tongue)

06:50.865 --> 06:53.069
Home renovations can be
an emotional process.

06:53.102 --> 06:55.875
-Let's do it.
-BRAN: Now, I have to convince
the owners that

06:55.908 --> 06:58.747
we're not here to destroy
their memories,

06:58.781 --> 07:00.551
we're here to help them
make new ones.

07:00.584 --> 07:02.154
♪ ♪

07:07.799 --> 07:09.669
Okay

07:09.703 --> 07:12.575
And, boom, we knock out
all the walls.

07:12.609 --> 07:15.113
Make an open concept
first floor.

07:15.146 --> 07:17.952
It's gonna create much better
flow and, most importantly,

07:17.986 --> 07:19.889
it's gonna bring in tons
of natural light.

07:19.923 --> 07:21.526
-I love it, it's perfect.
-BRAN: Thank you.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.463
-I don't think that's perfect.
-BRAN: And...

07:23.497 --> 07:25.768
we can also get rid of this
dated and awkward storage

07:25.801 --> 07:28.239
and replace it
with a master

07:28.272 --> 07:31.613
his-and-hers mega-closet. Yeah.

07:31.647 --> 07:33.584
-Fantastic.
-With custom shelves

07:33.617 --> 07:35.220
for all of Nadja's shoes
and her doll.

07:35.253 --> 07:37.759
Plus, a dedicated hat wall

07:37.792 --> 07:39.596
with hat racks for all

07:39.629 --> 07:40.798
of Laszlo's dope hats.

07:40.831 --> 07:43.504
That cannot be our house.

07:43.537 --> 07:46.075
You're right,
that cannot be our house.

07:46.108 --> 07:47.712
-This fella is the knackers.
-Thank you.

07:47.745 --> 07:49.616
Now, let's talk about
that unfinished attic.

07:49.649 --> 07:51.820
I think we should reimagine it

07:51.853 --> 07:54.492
as a spacious master suite

07:54.526 --> 07:56.763
slash love nest
for Nandor and Marwa.

07:56.797 --> 07:59.736
It doesn't matter how many
changes you make to something.

07:59.769 --> 08:01.773
-The novelty
eventually wears off.
-Mm.

08:01.807 --> 08:03.844
-I agree with my husband.
-(sighs)

08:03.877 --> 08:05.514
NANDOR:
But I do like

08:05.548 --> 08:08.252
that sign about home
being where the wine is.

08:08.286 --> 08:10.123
-Okay. There is another option.
-MARWA: Me, too.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.593
In this option,

08:11.626 --> 08:13.196
you can keep
your current bedroom...

08:13.229 --> 08:15.768
-NANDOR: Mm.
-...and we reimagine the attic

08:15.801 --> 08:17.905
as a dedicated
"man cave" for Nandor.

08:17.939 --> 08:19.241
-Man cave?
-BRAN: Yeah.

08:19.274 --> 08:20.745
NANDOR:
What is a man cave?

08:20.778 --> 08:22.280
Man cave is where
you do your man stuff.

08:22.314 --> 08:25.654
So, there are no women allowed
in this man cave?

08:25.688 --> 08:26.990
Hey, it's your space up there,

08:27.024 --> 08:28.694
-you do with it what you please.
-Great.

08:28.727 --> 08:31.098
Guess what?
I hate all of that. That attic

08:31.132 --> 08:33.637
is full of very precious,
treasured memories

08:33.670 --> 08:35.273
of us putting all
of our trash up there.

08:35.306 --> 08:38.012
Also, we do not need
a wall of hat hooks.

08:38.046 --> 08:41.653
Laszlo only has one hat,
and it's bloody cursed!

08:41.686 --> 08:43.824
Correction, my darling,
I have five hats.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.193
I have the one
she's referring to,

08:45.226 --> 08:46.897
which she doesn't like
for some unknown reason.

08:46.930 --> 08:48.934
-(groans)
-It's actually very cool.
-I'm sure it is.

08:48.967 --> 08:51.205
It might be made out of witch
skin and has an asshole on it,

08:51.238 --> 08:53.142
but I look fantastic wearing it.

08:53.176 --> 08:55.113
And another is a yellow ballcap

08:55.146 --> 08:56.783
with the message across it,

08:56.817 --> 08:58.854
-"Absolut Aces..."
-Ooh, where'd you get that?

08:58.887 --> 09:01.727
...which was a gift
from the 2006 movie premiere

09:01.760 --> 09:03.162
of the movie

09:03.196 --> 09:04.866
-BOTH: Smokin' Aces.
-You know the film?

09:04.899 --> 09:06.803
-I love it. It's classic.
-Well, I've never worn it.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.241
Where you going, Nadja? I got
something special for you, too.

09:09.274 --> 09:11.847
Check this out.
No home would be complete

09:11.880 --> 09:14.853
without a serene master bath
fit for a queen.

09:14.886 --> 09:16.890
I don't care about any of this.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.228
Uh, do you care
about a gold toilet?

09:19.261 --> 09:20.965
Bang!

09:20.998 --> 09:23.102
(clears throat)
A gold toilet?

09:23.136 --> 09:24.672
Queen's got to have her throne,
am I right, guys?

09:24.706 --> 09:26.208
You can't even take a (bleep).

09:26.242 --> 09:28.279
I will take a (bleep)
if I want to take a (bleep).

09:28.312 --> 09:31.185
Stop trying to water down
my brand. (hisses)

09:31.218 --> 09:33.791
I've given the owners
a lot to think about.

09:33.824 --> 09:35.928
Now it's time to let them
talk it over.

09:37.197 --> 09:38.801
I really don't think

09:38.834 --> 09:40.336
this kind of public exposure
is good for us.

09:40.370 --> 09:41.940
I really think that
we should just let these guys

09:41.973 --> 09:43.009
paint a wall or two
and get them out of here.

09:43.042 --> 09:44.746
"These guys"?

09:44.779 --> 09:47.050
Bran and Toby are artisans.
They're craftspeople.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.854
Toby is dead, okay?

09:48.887 --> 09:50.991
And it's only a matter of time
before someone notices.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.227
No, are you not paying attention

09:52.260 --> 09:53.997
to my very
comprehensive hypnosis?

09:54.031 --> 09:56.202
And no one watching this footage

09:56.235 --> 09:58.674
will notice
that we are vampires.

09:58.707 --> 10:01.011
Not the editors,

10:01.045 --> 10:03.617
not the editors' assistants,

10:03.650 --> 10:05.988
not the sound mixers,

10:06.021 --> 10:08.192
not the, uh...

10:08.226 --> 10:10.363
Who else is there?

10:10.396 --> 10:12.969
Color correctors,
current executives,

10:13.002 --> 10:14.371
Standards & Practices

10:14.404 --> 10:16.208
occasionally looks
at a rough cut.

10:16.242 --> 10:18.981
A producer's girlfriend named
Wendy one time gave notes,

10:19.014 --> 10:21.152
and now she gives notes
on all the cuts.

10:21.185 --> 10:22.420
-Then there are...
-Okay, okay, I get it.

10:22.454 --> 10:25.694
Yes. All of those nerds, too.

10:25.728 --> 10:29.001
Also you will put the bit
that I am saying in now

10:29.034 --> 10:32.274
as a flashback and then
cut back to the main story

10:32.307 --> 10:35.380
of whatever else is going on.

10:35.413 --> 10:37.017
GUILLERMO:
I don't know.

10:37.050 --> 10:39.054
I have a really bad feeling
about this.

10:39.087 --> 10:42.194
Do you think home really
is "where the wine is"?

10:42.227 --> 10:44.799
I want it to be accurate
for my man cave.

10:44.833 --> 10:46.335
Yes, I agree.

10:46.368 --> 10:48.072
NANDOR:
There's a surprise.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.978
Now, I think we all know
what to do.

10:52.147 --> 10:55.019
All right, gang, you've had
time to think it over.

10:55.053 --> 10:57.057
And now it's decision time.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.762
Are you ready
to "embrace your space"?

10:59.796 --> 11:03.002
Or do you want to tell this
son of a B to "go flip off"?

11:06.776 --> 11:10.316
There's just no storage space
for me to do my business.

11:10.350 --> 11:13.389
Let me get this... Oh, sorry.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.796
A gold toilet?

11:16.830 --> 11:20.236
I have a really bad feeling
about this.

11:24.077 --> 11:25.714
Um...

11:25.748 --> 11:27.752
We've decided to...

11:29.321 --> 11:32.060
ALL THREE:
Embrace our space!

11:32.093 --> 11:33.864
Yes! That is music to my ears.

11:33.897 --> 11:36.035
I promise you're gonna
love this place

11:36.068 --> 11:37.838
so much more
when we're finished with it.

11:37.872 --> 11:39.107
And we're gonna
up your curb appeal

11:39.141 --> 11:40.844
by re-sodding the lawn

11:40.878 --> 11:42.347
and the backyard

11:42.380 --> 11:43.951
Oh, re-sodding, hey?

11:43.984 --> 11:45.921
Y-You're gonna dig
up the-the backyard?

11:45.955 --> 11:47.057
Yeah, I'm an expert
at landscaping.

11:47.090 --> 11:48.359
Meanwhile, my brother

11:48.392 --> 11:50.798
likes to spend his time
manscaping.

11:50.831 --> 11:52.902
-Boom!
-(laughter)

11:52.935 --> 11:55.240
I don't know what that means,
but (bleep) Toby, right?

11:55.273 --> 11:57.812
Yeah, he gets it. All right,
what are we doing standing

11:57.845 --> 12:00.918
around here? We've got
to get to... ♪ Work. ♪

12:00.951 --> 12:03.857

This gang, they keep
some pretty unusual hours,

12:06.428 --> 12:08.934
working for the railroad
and owning the nightclub.

12:08.967 --> 12:12.173

12:56.462 --> 12:58.165
-Yes.
-I'm almost finished over here,

12:58.199 --> 12:59.802
then moving onto the door,
honey.

12:59.836 --> 13:00.871
Don't forget to put
the lock on it.

13:00.904 --> 13:02.007
You got it, honey.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.311
Uh, check out this bar.

13:04.344 --> 13:05.848
What?

13:05.881 --> 13:07.818
This is
an entertainer's dream.

13:07.852 --> 13:10.824
Nandor, I want you
to picture this right now, okay?

13:10.858 --> 13:12.060
The guys are over.
They're hanging out.

13:12.093 --> 13:13.429
-Okay, I am picturing it.
-Mm-hmm.

13:13.462 --> 13:15.366
I could be over here
at the bar counter.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.039
And then one of the guys would
come right behind me and...

13:18.072 --> 13:19.942
(grunting)

13:19.976 --> 13:21.478
Yeah, mm-hmm.

13:21.513 --> 13:23.349
We could put a little skylight
in the floor there,

13:23.382 --> 13:26.322
and look through it
and see Guillermo on the toilet.

13:26.355 --> 13:28.894
Oh, no, we don't need
a skylight in the bathroom.

13:28.927 --> 13:31.265
Nonsense, clear sight lines
are what buyers are looking for

13:31.298 --> 13:33.035
these days, right, Bran?

13:33.069 --> 13:34.505
Hey, who's the host
of this show, this guy or me?

13:34.539 --> 13:36.342
(laughs)
I love it.

13:36.375 --> 13:38.547
You know what I also love?
Look at this distressed wood.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.884
I mean, it's giving everyone
the shabby chic look

13:40.918 --> 13:42.320
that I know that you love...

13:42.354 --> 13:44.024
-Meets French country.
-Thank you very much.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.527
And how about
the whimsical seating?

13:45.561 --> 13:47.498
Have we talked about it yet?
I don't think we have.

13:47.531 --> 13:49.468
-Get down in it, brother.
-NANDOR: This?

13:49.502 --> 13:51.271
-That's for you.
-No.

13:51.305 --> 13:53.009
-This is your throne.
-GUILLERMO: It's not a dog bed?

13:53.042 --> 13:55.013
Give it test spin right now.
You're gonna love it.

13:55.046 --> 13:56.415
-No, he doesn't really get
comfortable so eas--
-Here we go.

13:56.448 --> 13:59.287
-Oh!
-How perfect is that?

13:59.321 --> 14:02.327
-Pretty perfect, Bran.
-Yeah!

14:02.360 --> 14:05.934
NARRATOR:
But the project wasn't a smooth
ride from beginning to end.

14:05.968 --> 14:08.874
Bran got a call from the City
Building Inspector's office

14:08.907 --> 14:12.313
about the permits,
and the news was... not good.

14:12.347 --> 14:14.151
No, no, I understand.

14:14.184 --> 14:17.090
It's just that we've done
over 150 of these renovations,

14:17.123 --> 14:18.994
and this issue has
never come up before.

14:19.027 --> 14:20.329
MALE VOICE:
Sir, they don't pay me enough

14:20.363 --> 14:22.133
to fight with you, okay?
I'm sorry,

14:22.167 --> 14:24.004
but that's just where
the situation currently stands.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.175
All right? So you're just gonna
have to take it up with--

14:26.208 --> 14:28.345
-Son of a B!
-Sir?

14:28.379 --> 14:31.953
Oh, guys... (groans)
I'm so sorry to report this.

14:31.986 --> 14:33.523
But I just got off the phone

14:33.557 --> 14:35.259
with the City Building
Inspector's office.

14:35.293 --> 14:37.565
-And I've got some bad news.
-Bad news?!

14:37.598 --> 14:40.002
♪ ♪

14:41.338 --> 14:42.474
(gasps)

14:50.456 --> 14:52.193
with the City Building
Inspector's office.

14:52.227 --> 14:53.329
And I got some bad news.

14:53.362 --> 14:55.333
-Bad news?
-I'm afraid so.

14:55.366 --> 14:58.239
Apparently Guillermo's room does
not meet the legal requirements

14:58.272 --> 15:00.611
to call it a room.
The legal term is

15:00.644 --> 15:03.082
"hidey hole"
or a "rat's studio."

15:03.115 --> 15:04.552
That's okay,
I really don't mind.

15:04.585 --> 15:06.422
What the (bleep) does that mean?

15:06.455 --> 15:08.125
I'll tell you what
the F it means, L-Train.

15:08.159 --> 15:10.229
It means that we gotta now
reallocate this budget

15:10.263 --> 15:13.102
to get Guillermo's room
up to code.

15:13.135 --> 15:15.006
No, no, no. No one needs
to make a big fuss.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.442
(bleep) his room.

15:16.475 --> 15:18.179
What the (bleep) are
our options, B-boy?

15:18.212 --> 15:19.649
Well, I love the passion.
I'm gonna get on that couch,

15:19.682 --> 15:21.653
and show you what we got, okay?

15:21.686 --> 15:24.424
Open this up, and show you guys
what I worked up. Gather in.

15:24.458 --> 15:26.696
Now if we eliminate
Nadja's gold toilet...

15:26.729 --> 15:28.667
-(gasps) Eat (bleep)!
-Hang on a second.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.138
If we eliminate it,
we can open up that wall,

15:31.171 --> 15:33.510
and create a ventilation system
for Guillermo.

15:33.543 --> 15:34.679
What the (bleep) is this,
Club Med?

15:34.712 --> 15:36.415
We need the gold toilet!

15:36.448 --> 15:39.387
Hang on a second, 'cause
we're also going to have to...

15:39.421 --> 15:41.559
eliminated Nandor's
custom sign that says,

15:41.593 --> 15:43.730
-"Home is where the wine is."
-Get (bleep)!

15:43.763 --> 15:46.401
Because can then
close the open septic tank,

15:46.435 --> 15:49.207
which apparently is pooling
underneath Guillermo's bed.

15:49.241 --> 15:51.278
Well, I guess
if there's no other way...

15:51.311 --> 15:54.351
NARRATOR:
And finally even grouchy
Guillermo was grinning.

15:54.384 --> 15:56.623
Meanwhile,
Marwa's got a surprise

15:56.656 --> 15:58.660
that even I haven't seen yet.

15:58.693 --> 16:00.697
NARRATOR:
Only midway through renovations,

16:00.731 --> 16:03.202
but Marwa was working
around the clock.

16:03.235 --> 16:04.404
You think he's ready?

16:04.437 --> 16:06.743
-You ready? Let's do it.
-Ready.

16:06.776 --> 16:09.447
And voilà!

16:09.481 --> 16:11.686
(chuckling):
Okay, all right.

16:11.719 --> 16:13.557
-Wow.
-Wow!

16:13.590 --> 16:16.161
BRAN:
Wow, wow.

16:16.195 --> 16:18.733
Are you looking at this?
Incredible.

16:18.767 --> 16:21.038
-Wow.
-BRAN: Tiny plant, hello.

16:21.071 --> 16:22.608
Look at this, decorative balls?

16:22.641 --> 16:24.645
-You can't go wrong with those.
-NANDOR: I love balls.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.381
-I love balls, too.
-BRAN: I love balls, too.

16:26.415 --> 16:28.085
And who wants to belly
up to the bar?

16:28.118 --> 16:30.389
Saddle up, giddy up!
Let's get up to the bar.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.327
-NANDOR: John would've
loved those.
-Right.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.164
I love how the colors

16:34.197 --> 16:37.370
on the rug are just playing
with the new hardwoods,

16:37.403 --> 16:39.174
And then look
at the hoop right there.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.245

25:35.947 --> 25:37.984
And I'm pleased to report the
raccoons have stopped (bleep)

25:38.018 --> 25:39.988
under the sofa.

25:40.022 --> 25:41.692
Well... most of them have.

25:41.726 --> 25:43.730

working for you, was

26:05.774 --> 26:07.143
this baby up and make some

26:07.176 --> 26:08.980
of your world-famous spaghetti,
