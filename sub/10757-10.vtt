00:16.898 --> 00:20.174
I specifically requested
my macaroni and cheese <i>al dente.</i>

00:20.485 --> 00:23.716
I know.
This lunch is a culinary Hindenberg.

00:24.031 --> 00:29.947
Niles, our food may be payback for your
recent editorial, <i>Cafeteria of Shame.</i>

00:31.163 --> 00:34.758
They can't intimidate me.
They'll never silence my pen.

00:35.083 --> 00:37.961
I could write an exposÃ©
on their baked goods alone.

00:38.253 --> 00:41.848
Yes, this is the hardest roll
since <i>Hamlet.</i>

00:42.174 --> 00:45.132
- Good one, Frasier. May I use it?
- But of course.

00:45.427 --> 00:47.702
These biscotti
represent an all-time low.

00:47.971 --> 00:52.249
Chalky aftertaste,
inelegant aroma, spongy.

00:52.601 --> 00:56.674
Spongy biscotti is an unwelcome
trespasser into madeleine territory.

00:58.065 --> 01:00.818
These pistachios
are like swallowing gravel.

01:01.109 --> 01:03.339
It's a wonder I've escaped injury.

01:03.612 --> 01:07.890
Your ability to cheat death
at every turn never ceases to amaze.

01:08.784 --> 01:11.139
- Someone's in a mood.
- I'm sorry.

01:11.411 --> 01:13.879
You know how you
find yourself getting restless?

01:14.164 --> 01:16.120
I have a feeling I'm about to.

01:19.753 --> 01:21.471
Hello? Yes.

01:21.713 --> 01:22.782
Really?

01:23.006 --> 01:25.679
Bravo. <i>Eccellente. Benissimo.</i>

01:27.427 --> 01:30.897
- You'll never guess who that was.
- The Three Tenors?

01:32.683 --> 01:34.833
No, that was my antique scout.

01:35.102 --> 01:37.662
The present for
Maris' birthday has arrived.

01:37.938 --> 01:40.736
I got her
the most exquisite antique saddle.

01:41.024 --> 01:43.584
How does it look on you?

01:49.324 --> 01:51.315
You won't laugh when you see it.

01:51.576 --> 01:54.215
It is bejewelled,
but not overdone, like Maris.

01:54.496 --> 01:58.250
The craftsmanship is breathtaking.
It's been so expertly restored,

01:58.583 --> 02:01.700
- you can barely see the stitching.
- Again, like Maris.

02:03.296 --> 02:06.174
Someone is in a mood today.
I'll get this.

02:06.466 --> 02:10.061
Thank you. You'd better go
to the wine club on your own tonight.

02:10.387 --> 02:11.706
What?

02:11.930 --> 02:16.162
It'll just be the same old faces
rehashing the same boring topics.

02:16.518 --> 02:19.157
You are upset.
Let's get your mind off it.

02:19.438 --> 02:20.837
Dinner? Chamber music?

02:21.148 --> 02:25.585
There's a wonderful lecture series on
the history of modern lecture series.

02:25.944 --> 02:29.300
I don't think so.
I feel like being on my own tonight.

02:29.614 --> 02:31.889
- You don't mind, do you?
- Of course not.

02:32.159 --> 02:35.708
- I'll see you at Cucina tomorrow.
- We'd better play that by ear.

02:36.038 --> 02:38.268
- As you wish.
- Are you upset?

02:38.540 --> 02:40.531
I'd have to have a fragile ego

02:40.792 --> 02:43.147
to be upset because you
want time away from me.

02:43.420 --> 02:45.490
Separate checks, please.

02:48.925 --> 02:52.804
- Marty, we're getting hungry.
- It's coming.

02:53.138 --> 02:56.335
Here we go. Cold cuts, pizza rolls,

02:56.642 --> 02:59.679
devilled eggs, pork roll-ups.

02:59.978 --> 03:03.175
Yes, the ideal buffet for a group
of heavy-set men over 60.

03:05.275 --> 03:08.347
I assume
everyone's affairs are in order?

03:09.988 --> 03:12.456
We're about ready
to start our poker game.

03:12.741 --> 03:16.097
- I'll be on my way in a minute.
- OK.

03:17.871 --> 03:20.943
- We're about ready to start...
- I heard you, Dad.

03:21.249 --> 03:23.888
I'm trying to figure out
what to do with myself.

03:24.169 --> 03:27.559
Lately my old routine
doesn't seem to satisfy me anymore.

03:27.881 --> 03:31.556
Maybe I could join you and the guys
for some cards?

03:31.885 --> 03:35.764
- I just don't think you'd fit in.
- Roz is playing.

03:36.098 --> 03:39.215
Roz is one of the guys.
She knows more dirty jokes than Duke.

03:39.518 --> 03:42.988
I could tell you a tale
that'd make you blush like a schoolgirl.

03:43.313 --> 03:47.864
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Let him play. It can't hurt anything.

03:48.235 --> 03:51.352
- All right.
- Thanks, Dad. Let me get that for you.

03:51.655 --> 03:54.692
Guys, Frasier's
going to sit in with us tonight.

03:56.660 --> 03:59.891
- You're going to play with us?
- Don't look so surprised.

04:00.205 --> 04:03.322
Sometimes
I enjoy a night with the guys.

04:03.625 --> 04:05.741
OK, seven-card stud, high-low,

04:06.003 --> 04:08.995
- chips to win, the wheel is no good.
- Perfect.

04:09.297 --> 04:11.936
- Three bump limit.
- Sounds good.

04:12.217 --> 04:15.414
- You're lost, aren't you?
- Like a Bedouin in a sandstorm.

04:16.887 --> 04:19.083
You guys get your all-weather tyres
on yet?

04:19.349 --> 04:22.227
I'm going to Richie's.
I'll let him do it.

04:22.519 --> 04:25.795
- At Tim's you get free Armor All.
- You ever been to Hank's?

04:26.106 --> 04:29.303
Yeah, I've been to Hank's.
Right next to Mike's Hardware.

04:29.609 --> 04:32.362
At Mike's
they got those cordless drills.

04:32.654 --> 04:37.409
You ought to try Tommy's. Free
battery testers with every purchase.

04:37.784 --> 04:38.773
I'm out.

04:39.745 --> 04:41.736
Thanks for the money.

04:41.997 --> 04:45.069
- That was a bust.
- Be glad you got out before the debate

04:45.375 --> 04:47.764
over who'd be more fun
on a desert island,

04:48.045 --> 04:50.923
Angie Dickinson or Ursula Andress.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.774
That is ludicrous. It's Angie Dickinson.

04:55.510 --> 04:58.024
Dr Crane,
I know it's none of my business,

04:58.305 --> 05:00.421
but... Never mind.

05:00.682 --> 05:02.673
No, go ahead.

05:03.268 --> 05:07.056
Perhaps you're restless because
of a lack of female companionship.

05:07.397 --> 05:09.388
- So I thought...
- Oh, dear.

05:09.650 --> 05:14.565
I'm meeting my friend Clare for drinks
tonight and she's feeling restless also.

05:14.946 --> 05:18.734
Stop right there.
You know my policy on fix-ups.

05:19.076 --> 05:21.544
She's pretty, lonely,
and an underwear model.

05:21.828 --> 05:23.819
You do know my policy. Off we go.

05:33.173 --> 05:35.209
Say hello to the Fox and Whistle.

05:35.467 --> 05:37.458
You point her out, and I will.

05:38.679 --> 05:41.432
- Give us a kiss.
- I hope he's talking to you.

05:41.723 --> 05:44.078
- Evening, all.
- Daphne!

05:45.185 --> 05:48.382
- There's Clare now.
- She's everything you said she was.

05:48.689 --> 05:50.884
- I'm engaged.
- And more.

05:51.525 --> 05:55.359
- When did this happen?
- My old boyfriend Bob surprised me.

05:55.821 --> 05:59.894
You've got to meet him. He brought
someone you might be interested in.

06:00.242 --> 06:02.802
He is nice looking, isn't he?

06:04.413 --> 06:06.404
Coming, Pookey.

06:07.708 --> 06:10.541
It seems I've dragged you
down here for nothing.

06:10.836 --> 06:14.272
I would've missed seeing
the world's most nauseating couple

06:14.589 --> 06:16.580
defend their title.

06:17.759 --> 06:21.388
- We can leave if you like.
- No, you go talk with your friend.

06:21.722 --> 06:23.917
- I'll have a drink.
- What do you need?

06:24.182 --> 06:26.491
I've been asking myself that all day.

06:26.768 --> 06:29.407
- Seems that lately my life...
- I'll come back.

06:33.066 --> 06:35.057
I forgot that story.

06:35.319 --> 06:40.154
It doesn't top the time Leo and I broke
up that fight in the strip joint.

06:40.532 --> 06:43.604
We walked in there
and there was this one girl who...

06:43.910 --> 06:46.982
Marty, maybe you shouldn't tell
that particular story.

06:47.289 --> 06:50.122
- Because of Roz?
- If I can handle

06:50.417 --> 06:53.056
the Angie-Ursula debate,
I can handle this.

06:53.337 --> 06:57.376
You agreed with me, right?
You said you'd rather sleep with Angie.

06:58.216 --> 07:01.606
One more time, Leo.
If I had to choose.

07:05.432 --> 07:08.026
You start telling them
that strip-joint story.

07:08.310 --> 07:12.508
You guys will bust a gut.
Anybody else need a beer? Roz?

07:13.565 --> 07:15.954
- Remember?
- I'm sorry. I forgot. Yeah.

07:16.234 --> 07:19.988
Afraid you won't control yourself
with all these handsome guys?

07:20.322 --> 07:22.916
Too late for that, Frank.
I'm pregnant.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.509
What, really? That's great.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.194
I remember when Annie was pregnant.

07:28.455 --> 07:32.243
There is nothing more beautiful
than a pregnant broad.

07:34.503 --> 07:37.859
Best thing I ever did was having kids.

07:38.173 --> 07:41.370
From the moment you hold
that brand-new baby in your arms,

07:41.677 --> 07:44.510
- your life changes.
- You're right about that.

07:44.805 --> 07:48.923
What about when they grab your finger?
That's the greatest feeling.

07:49.267 --> 07:52.498
The joy of seeing them
look up at you and smile.

07:52.813 --> 07:56.328
- Cherish every moment, Roz.
- One minute they're on your lap.

07:56.650 --> 08:00.404
Next thing they're out the door
with lives of their own.

08:00.737 --> 08:05.288
And it's just you,
old and alone in an empty house.

08:06.159 --> 08:08.150
So empty.

08:15.210 --> 08:18.486
Leo, I don't think
you told that story right.

08:20.257 --> 08:24.045
- I think Steven likes you.
- I hope so. He's adorable.

08:24.386 --> 08:27.503
I was flattered he assumed
I was an underwear model, too.

08:27.806 --> 08:29.876
You didn't rush to correct him.

08:30.142 --> 08:32.940
There'll be time for that
after the wedding.

08:33.770 --> 08:36.443
Maybe I should just tell
Dr Crane to go home.

08:36.732 --> 08:40.725
I'm surprised you brought your boss.
I could never relax around mine.

08:41.068 --> 08:44.744
- What if he likes the place?
- That's nothing I have to worry about.

08:45.073 --> 08:47.143
This pub really isn't his style.

09:02.799 --> 09:06.712
Daphne, sing a song with us.
You're not shy singing around the house.

09:07.054 --> 09:08.567
You live together?

09:08.805 --> 09:12.320
- She's my dad's healthcare worker.
- You don't model underwear?

09:12.643 --> 09:16.636
Only if her robe's
not cinched up tight enough.

09:16.980 --> 09:20.177
Come on, Frasier, we're going to do
<i>Knees Up, Mother Brown.</i>

09:20.484 --> 09:23.999
I don't know that. I know.
Let's bring sheet music tomorrow night.

09:24.321 --> 09:28.951
Tomorrow? You can't. I mean, do you know
you have that gallery opening tomorrow?

09:29.326 --> 09:32.602
No, but if you hum a few bars,
I'll try to pick it up.

09:42.130 --> 09:45.088
Sherry,
Daphne's clearing out for a night.

09:45.384 --> 09:49.343
Why don't you come over?
I'll get a fire going,

09:49.680 --> 09:53.992
open up a bottle of bubbly,
put a little Bobby Darin on the stereo,

09:55.227 --> 09:58.617
and then
"Look out, Macky's back in town".

10:01.274 --> 10:04.903
I thought it up before I called you.
What's the difference?

10:05.237 --> 10:06.716
OK, see you soon.

10:08.198 --> 10:10.189
Don't you look beautiful.

10:10.450 --> 10:15.240
Thank you. It's so nice to have
my pub back again. At least for a night.

10:15.622 --> 10:19.979
- You are sure Dr Crane has plans?
- He and Niles are going to the opera.

10:20.335 --> 10:24.487
Let's hope it's a long German one. I
don't want him showing up for last call.

10:26.091 --> 10:28.446
Good evening, Daphne.
You look smashing.

10:28.719 --> 10:32.553
- I was just on my way out.
- To the Fox and Whistle? I'll come.

10:32.889 --> 10:35.687
Let me just get me brolly
and Bob's your uncle.

10:35.976 --> 10:38.774
I thought you were
going to the opera.

10:39.062 --> 10:43.692
That's tomorrow night. I hope Winston's
at the pub. I owe him five quid.

10:44.067 --> 10:48.743
- I'm not feeling so well.
- Hope it's not flu.

10:49.114 --> 10:51.867
- I think I'll stay home.
- That's for the best.

10:52.159 --> 10:54.719
Got to be careful what
you bring down to the pub.

10:54.995 --> 10:56.872
Tell me about it.

10:57.414 --> 10:59.405
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier.

11:00.417 --> 11:03.568
- Is something the matter?
- Had a rough night last night.

11:03.879 --> 11:05.551
How so?

11:05.797 --> 11:07.788
I gave Maris her birthday saddle.

11:09.593 --> 11:13.666
She was so thrilled she treated me
to a little Lady Godiva impression.

11:14.014 --> 11:19.805
Apparently the oils in the saddle
reacted badly with her cellulite cream.

11:20.228 --> 11:22.537
It created a powerful epoxy.

11:24.608 --> 11:26.166
Oh, dear.

11:26.401 --> 11:31.350
It took an hour and a full bottle of
nail polish remover to get her free.

11:31.740 --> 11:33.731
Today her thighs were so raw

11:33.992 --> 11:38.782
the only way she could find comfort was
to straddle a frozen Butterball turkey.

11:42.250 --> 11:47.040
The only thing that cheered me up
was the thought of the opera tonight.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.948
- That's tomorrow.
- No, it's tonight.

11:50.217 --> 11:52.970
- I have the tickets right here.
- Oh, no.

11:53.762 --> 11:55.753
Is there a problem?

11:56.014 --> 11:59.324
Yes. There's a billiard tournament
at the pub tonight.

11:59.643 --> 12:02.396
You're passing up
<i>Orpheus and Eurydice</i> to shoot pool

12:02.688 --> 12:04.679
at a sticky-floored saloon?

12:04.940 --> 12:10.378
My partner Terrence is skipping
a family wedding just to participate.

12:10.779 --> 12:15.375
- Can't somebody take my place?
- I'd just as soon be by myself.

12:15.742 --> 12:18.620
My brother has abandoned me.
My wife is cursing me.

12:18.912 --> 12:23.986
When Orpheus descends into hell, I'll
be waiting for him with a fruit basket.

12:24.376 --> 12:27.846
You can't stay mad at me. I'll
make it up to you. Press for the lift.

12:28.171 --> 12:31.163
Don't look at me that way.
That's what they call it.

12:49.568 --> 12:50.557
Ah, baby...

12:59.328 --> 13:01.717
Why is it so bloody dark in here?

13:01.997 --> 13:05.034
Bad enough I have to stay home,
I'm not going blind as well.

13:05.334 --> 13:07.325
You're staying in?

13:07.586 --> 13:10.976
No choice since your son
decided to go to my pub again.

13:11.298 --> 13:15.086
Imagine being so dense that
you can ruin someone else's evening

13:15.427 --> 13:18.783
and not even be aware of it.
This wax is dripping.

13:22.142 --> 13:25.373
Have you tried maybe dropping a hint?

13:25.687 --> 13:29.600
Believe me, I've dropped plenty.
They go right over his head.

13:29.941 --> 13:31.932
I'll have a glass of that.

13:32.944 --> 13:34.935
I've got to level with you.

13:35.197 --> 13:39.236
Sherry's coming over and
I'd hoped to have the place to myself.

13:39.576 --> 13:41.692
You ought to talk to Frasier,

13:41.953 --> 13:45.104
and I'm not saying this
to get you out of here.

13:45.415 --> 13:49.886
- Tell him to go find his own place.
- I can't say that.

13:50.253 --> 13:53.484
The longer you let it go,
the more attached he's going to get.

13:53.799 --> 13:56.632
- But he's my boss.
- But it's your pub.

13:58.595 --> 14:02.668
OK. That's it.
I'm going to go talk to him.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.005
Good for you.

14:07.896 --> 14:08.885
Hello?

14:10.315 --> 14:12.431
No, Maris,
sorry, you just missed him.

14:13.193 --> 14:15.184
Why are your teeth chattering?

14:20.283 --> 14:23.753
You're kidding me.
Can't you just use the defroster?

14:28.709 --> 14:34.022
I never dreamed we'd be eliminated
from the tournament in the first round.

14:34.881 --> 14:37.441
Guess I was a little rustier
than I thought.

14:37.718 --> 14:41.677
- Maybe you can still make that wedding.
- It's in Liverpool.

14:43.181 --> 14:45.172
Well, then, these are on me.

14:46.518 --> 14:48.907
Hey, it's Daphne. Hello, love.

14:49.187 --> 14:51.985
Evening, all.
Dr Crane, I have to talk to you.

14:52.274 --> 14:54.265
By all means, Daphne.

14:54.526 --> 14:58.360
Winston, let's have one of these pints
for Miss Moon, please.

14:59.281 --> 15:02.239
This is a nice surprise.
You must be feeling better.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.889
Here we are. You make a toast.

15:05.162 --> 15:07.915
I don't want you
coming down here ever again.

15:09.708 --> 15:13.621
I guess "Here's mud in your eye"
sounded mean the first time, too.

15:15.464 --> 15:18.934
I'm sorry if that sounds harsh
but I don't know what else to do.

15:19.259 --> 15:22.774
This is where I come to get away
from things, including my job,

15:23.096 --> 15:26.725
- and you are my boss.
- Daphne, I am so sorry.

15:27.643 --> 15:30.476
- I know that must sound selfish.
- No, not at all.

15:30.771 --> 15:34.446
You know, back in Boston
I had a bar like this one.

15:34.775 --> 15:38.893
I certainly understand what it's like
to have a place where you can get away.

15:40.238 --> 15:45.676
So, we've just got one solution.
This is your bar. I'll just go.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.954
I do appreciate this, Dr Crane.
I know you've made friends here, too.

15:51.291 --> 15:53.805
But you've got a history here.

15:54.086 --> 15:56.520
They've become like family to me.

15:56.797 --> 15:58.549
I'll just settle up and go.

15:58.799 --> 16:00.198
Hey, stranger.

16:00.425 --> 16:03.223
I've not been gone that long.
Two months is all.

16:03.512 --> 16:06.231
- Who's this new girl?
- Daphne, Clare's friend.

16:06.515 --> 16:08.745
- Been coming in the last month.
- A month?

16:09.017 --> 16:11.485
Hello. I'll see you at home, Dr Crane.

16:11.770 --> 16:15.206
- You've only been coming here a month?
- That's longer than you.

16:15.524 --> 16:18.914
There's no way I'm leaving now.
This bar has filled a void.

16:19.236 --> 16:22.990
I won't throw that away
because you beat me here by a fortnight.

16:23.323 --> 16:25.996
Stop talking like us.

16:26.284 --> 16:28.752
I don't know what you're arguing about

16:29.037 --> 16:32.234
but we settle things round here
with a quick game of cricket.

16:32.541 --> 16:34.850
- Darts?
- Yeah, rules are on the board.

16:35.127 --> 16:38.961
- There's got to be a better way.
- Well, I don't know. It's decisive.

16:39.298 --> 16:41.528
It's better than bickering.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.837
- It's not exactly my game.
- It's not mine either.

16:46.388 --> 16:49.460
- All right, let's try it.
- You shoot first, Daphne.

16:50.892 --> 16:53.486
I'm proud of us.
Two people with a conflict.

16:53.770 --> 16:56.204
We found a civilised way to settle it.

16:58.191 --> 16:59.260
Oh, my.

16:59.484 --> 17:01.440
- Is that good?
- Quite good.

17:01.695 --> 17:03.492
Lucky shot, then.

17:07.284 --> 17:10.753
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were trying to hustle me.

17:11.079 --> 17:14.788
Not at all. I may have played
a game or two of feathers in my day.

17:15.125 --> 17:18.753
A game or two? You made the most
difficult shot on the entire board.

17:19.755 --> 17:22.906
Actually, that's only
the second most difficult.

17:23.215 --> 17:25.286
That's the most difficult.

17:25.551 --> 17:30.307
Come to think of it, there might have
been a dartboard in that bar in Boston.

17:33.018 --> 17:35.009
Look at that. It's all tied up.

17:35.270 --> 17:38.148
Who would've guessed
those hands were so skilled?

17:38.440 --> 17:41.557
Certainly no one who's sampled
your corned beef hash.

17:47.491 --> 17:49.482
I score again.

17:49.743 --> 17:53.497
That's not something we hear
out of your mouth very often.

18:00.879 --> 18:02.870
You don't want to rush this one.

18:04.466 --> 18:08.095
- A lot riding on this.
- There's such a thing as sportsmanship.

18:08.428 --> 18:12.580
Really? This from a woman who made
armpit noises during my last round.

18:14.977 --> 18:16.251
Sod!

18:16.478 --> 18:21.836
I am sorry, Daphne. Now all I have to
do is make this relatively simple shot,

18:22.234 --> 18:25.909
- unless you'd like to concede defeat.
- Typical American arrogance.

18:26.238 --> 18:29.150
We Brits don't know
the meaning of the word defeat.

18:29.449 --> 18:33.806
Then you're not acquainted with a spat
called the Revolutionary War.

18:34.871 --> 18:37.101
Out of my way.

18:38.166 --> 18:43.957
Just like a Yank. Insulting us Brits
to cover up your inferiority complex.

18:44.381 --> 18:46.451
What should we feel inferior about?

18:46.717 --> 18:49.914
Your pioneering work
in the field of soccer hooliganism?

18:52.639 --> 18:56.598
Say your worst. There isn't as much
dignity in this entire country

18:56.935 --> 19:00.086
- as our queen's got in her finger.
- You've bested me there.

19:00.397 --> 19:02.786
What's more dignified
than a dowdy sandbag

19:03.066 --> 19:05.057
with a flower pot on her head?

19:06.528 --> 19:09.361
I win. The bar is mine.

19:10.824 --> 19:13.622
Lose the long faces, lads.
I'm staying.

19:15.412 --> 19:19.007
I hope you didn't take those barbs
about the motherland seriously.

19:19.333 --> 19:23.212
- Perhaps you'd better leave now.
- There's no greater Anglophile than I.

19:23.545 --> 19:26.343
No, really, I have
all my suits made at Savile Row.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.588
I spell "colour" with a "u".

19:37.100 --> 19:38.294
Hello, Niles.

19:38.518 --> 19:41.828
Well, look who's here.
Take a wrong turn on the way to the pub?

19:43.899 --> 19:46.777
Actually, that scene has grown tiresome

19:47.944 --> 19:50.174
and I miss this place.

19:50.447 --> 19:54.042
I've spoken to Daphne.
I take it it's over "over there"?

19:58.538 --> 20:00.449
You don't have to rub it in.

20:00.707 --> 20:04.780
Anyway, I know I owe you an apology
from the other night, so, here.

20:06.546 --> 20:08.537
I brought you a peace offering.

20:09.841 --> 20:12.594
<i>Orpheus and Eurydice.</i>
Thank you, Frasier.

20:12.886 --> 20:16.242
The Glyndebourne production.
I don't have this one.

20:16.556 --> 20:20.071
The <i>Chorus of the Furies</i> is particularly
moving and Janet Baker...

20:20.394 --> 20:24.273
...is quite simply the best contralto
solo I've ever heard.

20:24.606 --> 20:29.634
Thank you, Frasier. I don't have
<i>Orpheus and Eurydice</i> on eight-track yet.

20:30.445 --> 20:34.723
But I'm surprised to see you.
No woodworking club today?

20:35.075 --> 20:38.988
To tell you the truth,
I've grown tired of that crowd

20:39.329 --> 20:42.685
with their stupid bookends
and birdhouses.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.958
As soon as I shellac
my shoetrees, I'm out of there.

20:46.253 --> 20:48.289
- You got thrown out.
- I did not.

20:48.547 --> 20:51.141
- I can see through you.
- Are you a psychiatrist?

20:51.425 --> 20:54.303
No, but I can see it in your face.
You got kicked out.

20:54.594 --> 20:58.303
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would they throw me out?

20:59.305 --> 21:05.919
