WEBVTT

00:10.343 --> 00:15.933
We must break free from
the petty politics of the past.

00:16.015 --> 00:19.556
America is a nation of believers

00:19.645 --> 00:25.395
that is being led by a group
of censors, critics and cynics.

00:27.110 --> 00:33.410
All of the people telling you, "You
can't have the country you want,"

00:33.491 --> 00:37.161
are the same people
that wouldn't stand...

00:37.245 --> 00:42.835
I mean, they said, "Trump doesn't
have a chance of being here tonight."

00:43.501 --> 00:45.961
Oh, we love defeating
those people, don't we?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.546
Don't we love defeating them?

00:50.342 --> 00:54.682
To all Americans
tonight, I make this promise.

00:55.347 --> 00:59.017
We will make America safe again.

00:59.101 --> 01:03.311
We will make
America strong again.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.741
And we will make
America great again!

01:07.818 --> 01:10.278
God bless you and good night!

01:10.362 --> 01:11.492
I love you.

01:26.253 --> 01:29.843
My name is Roger Stone,
and I'm an agent provocateur.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.346
<i>Stone's Rules are things
that I have learned in life</i>

01:36.429 --> 01:38.519
that I seek to pass on to others

01:38.598 --> 01:42.058
who may want to be in the
same business that I'm in.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.564
Or, actually, any business,
'cause they are fully applicable.

01:44.647 --> 01:46.437
So, for example, a Stone's Rule:

01:46.523 --> 01:50.113
"It is better to be infamous
than never be famous at all."

01:50.193 --> 01:51.403
Stone's Rule.

01:56.700 --> 02:00.620
One man's dirty trick is
another man's political, civic action.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.964
Everything I do, everything
I've done, has been legal.

02:03.581 --> 02:07.291
<i>But politics ain't beanbag
and losers don't legislate.</i>

02:07.377 --> 02:10.007
The truth will be
suppressed no longer.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.258
Lock her up!

02:12.340 --> 02:13.760
Lock her up!

02:13.842 --> 02:16.512
Well, Roger has a
really rough reputation.

02:16.594 --> 02:19.394
They talk about "dirty trickster"
and lots of other things,

02:19.472 --> 02:24.852
but I've known him for a long
time, and he's actually a quality guy.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.397
He's a nice guy.

02:26.479 --> 02:27.899
Just a few
descriptions of you here:

02:27.981 --> 02:30.481
"a state-of-the-art
sleazeball," "a little rat,"

02:30.567 --> 02:32.277
"an actor who likes
to assume poses."

02:32.360 --> 02:33.700
<i>I believe in winning.</i>

02:33.779 --> 02:37.699
<i>I believe in doing whatever is
necessary to win, short of breaking the law.</i>

02:37.783 --> 02:41.203
In the world of political consulting,
there are a number of rogues.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.286
But there's...

02:42.370 --> 02:44.710
There's really nobody
quite like Roger Stone.

02:44.790 --> 02:48.540
Roger is the sinister Forrest
Gump of American politics.

02:48.626 --> 02:54.926
<i>He's not just this simpleminded guy,
but this Machiavellian, almost crazy guy</i>

02:55.008 --> 02:58.928
<i>who shows up at every key
moment in recent American history.</i>

03:03.350 --> 03:05.020
Roger has a great
understanding of the media.

03:05.102 --> 03:08.192
He understands politics and
he understands politicians.

03:08.271 --> 03:11.111
And he always likes
to take on somebody

03:11.191 --> 03:13.401
that at least has a
good chance of winning,

03:13.485 --> 03:15.065
and sometimes it
doesn't work out.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.283
He's had some people that I said,
"What are you doing with these people?"

03:18.365 --> 03:21.155
But, you know... But he
loves it and he loves the game.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.453
He has fun with it,
and he's very good at it.

03:25.956 --> 03:30.376
<i>Roger Stone created
Donald Trump as a political figure.</i>

03:30.460 --> 03:35.920
There is no doubt that in
tone, in affect, in profile,

03:36.008 --> 03:40.848
the Trump candidacy was a
pure Roger Stone production.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.349
When Mexico sends its people...

03:43.432 --> 03:45.062
They're bringing drugs,

03:45.142 --> 03:47.772
they're bringing crime,
they're rapists.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.313
And some, I assume,
are good people.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.357
<i>Whereas the
rest of us looked at Trump</i>

03:53.441 --> 03:56.691
<i>and saw someone who was
impossibly vulgar and impolite,</i>

03:56.779 --> 04:00.529
Roger looked at him and said, "You know,
this is someone who voters might like."

04:00.615 --> 04:03.075
I mean, Roger actually
gets democracy in a way,

04:03.160 --> 04:05.830
I think most people
who cover politics don't.

04:05.913 --> 04:09.293
You know, democracy is the
process of appealing to the majority.

04:12.669 --> 04:13.919
My name's Donald Trump,

04:14.004 --> 04:16.303
and I'm the largest real
estate developer in New York.

04:16.380 --> 04:21.851
<i>I own buildings all over the place,
model agencies, the Miss Universe pageant.</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:23.349
But it wasn't always so easy.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.930
About 13 years ago,
I was billions of dollars in debt.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.897
<i>But I fought back
and I won, big league.</i>

04:30.979 --> 04:35.359
<i>Now my company is bigger than it ever
was and I'm having more fun than I ever had.</i>

04:35.442 --> 04:36.532
Hello, everybody.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.949
<i>Fifteen
seasons of</i> The Apprentice

04:39.029 --> 04:41.069
<i>not only makes him a
smooth television performer,</i>

04:41.156 --> 04:42.696
<i>but think of the way he looked.</i>

04:42.783 --> 04:47.413
<i>High-backed chair, perfectly lit,
great makeup, great hair, decisive,</i>

04:47.495 --> 04:50.615
making decisions, running
the show. He looks presidential.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.837
Do you think voters,
non-sophisticates,

04:53.919 --> 04:57.129
make a difference between
entertainment and politics?

04:57.214 --> 05:00.134
Politics is show business
for ugly people.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.677
Roger always wanted me
to run for president.

05:02.761 --> 05:06.681
And over the years, every time
a presidential race came up,

05:06.764 --> 05:07.934
he always wanted me to run.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.436
And I just didn't have
interest at that time.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.228
And nor was the country in
trouble like it is today.

05:13.313 --> 05:17.733
The American Dream is dead.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.319
Bring it back!

05:21.654 --> 05:26.204
But if I get elected president,
I will bring it back.

05:27.244 --> 05:32.924
Bigger and better and
stronger than ever before.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.710
<i># Cowardice
 - Are you serious?</i>

05:36.794 --> 05:40.674
<i># Apologies for freedom
- I can't handle this!</i>

05:41.466 --> 05:43.926
<i># When freedom rings
-  Answer the call!</i>

05:44.011 --> 05:46.051
<i># On your feet
-  Stand up tall!</i>

05:46.138 --> 05:48.808
<i># Freedom's on our
shoulders - USA! </i>

05:50.100 --> 05:53.350
<i># Enemies of freedom</i>

05:53.937 --> 05:55.147
<i># Face the music</i>

05:55.230 --> 05:57.650
<i># Come on, boys Take 'em down!</i>

05:58.275 --> 06:02.315
<i># President Donald Trump
knows how To make America great </i>

06:02.904 --> 06:06.244
<i># Deal from strength Or
get crushed every time </i>

06:06.324 --> 06:08.994
It's really great to be
here in Cleveland, 2016.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.867
A lot of beautiful people here.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.919
1776!

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
<i># Over here
- USA! </i>

06:17.085 --> 06:19.085
<i># Over there
 -USA! </i>

06:19.171 --> 06:23.381
<i># O, say, can you see
It's not so easy </i>

06:23.466 --> 06:27.636
<i># But we have to stand up tall
And answer freedom's call </i>

06:27.720 --> 06:32.060
I have never been more excited
about a presidential campaign.

06:32.850 --> 06:37.810
I have never seen a
grassroots uprising.

06:38.606 --> 06:41.776
This is not the Republicans
versus the Democrats.

06:41.859 --> 06:42.949
That's right.

06:43.028 --> 06:46.858
This is the elites of the
Republican and Democratic Party

06:46.949 --> 06:49.079
who have driven this
country into the ditch

06:49.159 --> 06:53.249
versus Donald J. Trump
and the rest of America.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.125
I thank you for your support.

07:00.212 --> 07:06.302
We are on the verge of making
America great again. Thank you.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.555
<i>How are you doing? Good.</i>

07:12.640 --> 07:14.850
Take a picture with my son?
- Yes. How are ya?

07:14.935 --> 07:19.105
And if you decide to run for
president in, like, 2039, look me up.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.609
I will.

07:20.690 --> 07:25.150
<i>I understand how fame works.
You know, the four stages of fame.</i>

07:25.237 --> 07:27.987
It's like, "Who is Roger Stone?"

07:28.073 --> 07:29.743
"Get me Roger Stone."

07:29.824 --> 07:31.914
"Get me a Roger Stone type."

07:31.994 --> 07:33.454
"Who is Roger Stone?"

07:39.042 --> 07:42.172
<i>A mock election was planned
in my elementary school.</i>

07:42.254 --> 07:46.054
And I was for John F. Kennedy
because my parents were Catholic,

07:46.133 --> 07:47.933
and I thought, although
they were Republicans,

07:48.010 --> 07:50.350
they had a certain
sympathy for Kennedy.

07:50.428 --> 07:54.348
<i>But also because Kennedy's hair was
so much better than Nixon's hair.</i>

07:54.432 --> 07:56.852
<i>And, therefore, I
went to the cafeteria</i>

07:56.934 --> 07:59.694
<i>and as each kid would go
through the cafeteria line with their tray,</i>

07:59.771 --> 08:02.481
I would tell them, "You
know, Nixon has proposed

08:02.565 --> 08:04.645
having school on Saturdays."

08:05.568 --> 08:07.898
Well, then the mock
election was held,

08:07.988 --> 08:10.118
and to the surprise of
the local newspaper,

08:10.198 --> 08:13.198
<i>Democrat John Kennedy
swept this mock election.</i>

08:13.285 --> 08:17.655
For the first time ever, I understood
the value of disinformation.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.867
Of course, I've never
practiced it since then.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.671
We Republicans seek

08:24.754 --> 08:28.054
a government that attends to
its inherent responsibilities,

08:28.633 --> 08:32.303
encouraging a free and
a competitive economy,

08:32.970 --> 08:35.600
and enforcing law and order.

08:38.684 --> 08:42.015
<i>My first Republican
National Convention was 1964.</i>

08:42.105 --> 08:43.684
<i>I was 12 years old.</i>

08:43.773 --> 08:47.153
<i>The woman who lived next door to
me, she gave me a copy of a book,</i>

08:47.235 --> 08:49.605
The Conscience of a Conservative
<i>by Barry Goldwater.</i>

08:49.696 --> 08:52.486
<i>And I devoured this book
in, you know, a day.</i>

08:52.574 --> 08:55.454
It was at that moment that I
knew what I wanted to do.

08:55.535 --> 08:59.245
I no longer wanted to be an actor.
I now wanted to be in politics.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.921
<i>Little did I know how
similar they are.</i>

09:01.999 --> 09:04.959
I became a zealot. I had a
Goldwater sticker on my bicycle.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.585
I wore Goldwater buttons.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.221
I wore a Goldwater button two
weeks after the election was over.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.969
That's how defiant I was.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.050
<i>I met Roger in college.</i>

09:14.137 --> 09:17.887
<i>He was really a total prodigy,
in terms of his political ability.</i>

09:17.974 --> 09:23.404
He was talking grown men back
home into running for office, electing them.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.610
And then we would
sit in our dorm room

09:25.690 --> 09:28.030
and they would call
Roger for political advice

09:28.110 --> 09:30.320
as to how they should
vote on key issues.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.413
<i>His mother once said,
"You're not a Catholic.</i>

09:33.490 --> 09:37.490
Your religion is the Republican Party
and your god is Richard Nixon."

09:38.870 --> 09:41.660
<i>Bart Porter asked him,
you know, if he'd be interested</i>

09:41.748 --> 09:43.538
in coming to the Nixon campaign,

09:43.625 --> 09:47.625
so Roger took time off of
school to go join the campaign.

09:47.712 --> 09:51.342
<i>This is central headquarters
for the Re-Elect Nixon Campaign.</i>

09:51.424 --> 09:52.514
<i>The White House.</i>

09:52.592 --> 09:54.142
<i>But for the sake of appearances,</i>

09:54.219 --> 09:59.179
<i>the Re-Elect Nixon headquarters, in name,
is one block up Pennsylvania Avenue.</i>

09:59.266 --> 10:00.976
<i>The Committee to
Re-Elect the President</i>

10:01.058 --> 10:04.228
<i>was unlike any campaign
that I'd been in.</i>

10:04.312 --> 10:06.652
<i>It didn't look like your typical
political headquarters.</i>

10:06.731 --> 10:09.531
It had a very hushed,
corporate quality to it.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.949
<i>Porter called me into
his office and said,</i>

10:14.030 --> 10:15.910
<i>"We want you to go
to New Hampshire,</i>

10:15.990 --> 10:18.620
<i>and we want you to give this
contribution to Pete McCloskey,</i>

10:18.701 --> 10:20.701
<i>who's running for the
Republican nomination,</i>

10:20.787 --> 10:22.867
<i>challenging Nixon from the left,</i>

10:22.955 --> 10:25.745
in the name of the Young
Socialist Alliance."

10:25.833 --> 10:27.383
I got an enormous mason jar,

10:27.460 --> 10:30.630
filled it with pennies and
nickels and dimes and quarters.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.223
<i>I brought it to the
McCloskey headquarters.</i>

10:33.300 --> 10:34.880
I said, "Hi, I'm from the
Young Socialist Alliance.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.757
I wanna donate this,
and I need a receipt."

10:37.845 --> 10:39.755
They were so dumb,
they gave me one.

10:39.847 --> 10:43.187
The idea was to give the receipt
to the <i>Manchester Union Leader,</i>

10:43.268 --> 10:47.398
the largest newspaper in New Hampshire,
as a way of discrediting McCloskey.

10:47.480 --> 10:53.700
A perfect example of a dirty trick
that had no purpose and no effect,

10:53.778 --> 10:55.658
but the Nixon people
thought it was great.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.658
I never heard another
word about it...

10:57.740 --> 11:01.410
until an investigator from the Senate
Watergate Committee knocked on my door.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.794
<i>We have a mystery
story out of Washington.</i>

11:03.871 --> 11:05.581
<i>Five people have been
arrested and charged</i>

11:05.665 --> 11:08.285
<i>with breaking into the headquarters
of the Democratic National Committee</i>

11:08.376 --> 11:09.376
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

11:09.461 --> 11:11.301
<i>The Democratic
National Committee is located</i>

11:11.379 --> 11:13.089
<i>in the Watergate
office building.</i>

11:13.172 --> 11:15.012
I welcome this kind
of examination,

11:15.091 --> 11:18.931
because people have got to know whether
or not their president is a crook.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.391
Well, I'm not a crook.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.772
I've earned everything I've got.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.849
I was the youngest person to go
to the Watergate grand jury.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.984
<i>During the Senate Watergate
Committee hearings,</i>

11:30.064 --> 11:31.824
this enormous chart was put up,

11:31.899 --> 11:37.279
<i>in which everyone who received money from
this secret fund was put on the wall.</i>

11:37.364 --> 11:41.664
And it said, "Gordon
Liddy, McCord, Segretti."

11:41.743 --> 11:43.833
<i>And then way down at the
bottom, it said "Stone."</i>

11:43.911 --> 11:49.171
I paid $100 to Mr. Roger
Stone on one occasion.

11:49.251 --> 11:53.091
My parents called me on the phone.
They were mortified.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.010
I thought it was pretty cool.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.629
To leave office before
my term is completed

11:57.717 --> 12:00.387
is abhorrent to every
instinct in my body.

12:00.470 --> 12:06.310
<i>But as president, I must put the
interests of America first.</i>

12:06.392 --> 12:11.942
Therefore, I shall resign the
presidency effective at noon tomorrow.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.687
<i>I was a Watergate
figure at 19 years old.</i>

12:16.278 --> 12:19.198
<i>I mean, at the time, I
was scared shitless.</i>

12:19.281 --> 12:20.821
<i>It was very hard to find work.</i>

12:20.907 --> 12:23.827
<i>We used to have these buttons
that said "hire a Watergate vet."</i>

12:33.044 --> 12:36.464
<i>So this is the Batcave. This is
"the Factory," as we call it.</i>

12:37.214 --> 12:40.394
<i>This is where I tape my
Saturday radio shows.</i>

12:40.468 --> 12:42.388
It is also the repository

12:42.470 --> 12:47.020
of probably the world's largest
collection of Nixon memorabilia.

12:47.099 --> 12:50.309
The 1962 campaign for governor.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.355
Uh, a rally that I
actually attended.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.978
A head shot poster of the day.

12:55.483 --> 12:59.573
This is protesting Nixon's
historic trip to China.

12:59.654 --> 13:04.374
Here you have the first and
second generation Nixon bongs.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.661
This is among my most
prized possessions.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.705
<i>Roger Stone does occasional
political chores for Nixon.</i>

13:10.790 --> 13:15.590
<i>One such chore, to organize dinners of
journalists at Nixon's New Jersey home.</i>

13:16.338 --> 13:20.128
<i>I was the assigned liaison
between the Reagan campaign</i>

13:20.216 --> 13:23.886
and former President Nixon,
transmitting memos back and forth.

13:23.970 --> 13:27.600
<i>It was not until his post-presidency
that we became close friends.</i>

13:27.682 --> 13:29.352
<i>He had been through
a lot, obviously,</i>

13:29.434 --> 13:31.694
<i>but I think he was just
as resilient as ever.</i>

13:31.769 --> 13:34.109
His greatest single
quality is resilience.

13:34.188 --> 13:37.188
<i>And that's the purpose
of my tattoo.</i>

13:37.274 --> 13:39.194
<i>It's not an ideological
statement.</i>

13:39.276 --> 13:42.606
<i>It's a reminder that in life,
when you get knocked down,</i>

13:42.697 --> 13:46.447
you have to get up off the canvas and
keep pushing, get back in the game.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.294
That's the story of Nixon.

13:48.370 --> 13:53.790
A man is not finished when he is defeated.
He's only finished when he quits.

13:54.417 --> 13:58.207
<i>The Nixon tattoo is really
all you need to know about Roger.</i>

13:58.713 --> 14:01.973
Because he thinks Nixon's
approach to politics,

14:02.049 --> 14:05.759
the toughness, the
win-at-all-costs mentality,

14:05.845 --> 14:07.965
that's what Roger reflects.

14:08.055 --> 14:11.015
Delegates to the Young Republicans
Convention in Memphis

14:11.100 --> 14:14.900
have chosen as their chairman a
conservative with a Watergate past.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.979
<i>Watergate
dominated this convention</i>

14:17.064 --> 14:19.824
<i>because the Republican
Party's important youth arm</i>

14:19.901 --> 14:24.451
<i>was about to be taken over by Roger
Stone, a 25-year-old political operative</i>

14:24.531 --> 14:28.951
<i>who was deeply involved in the 1972
Nixon "dirty tricks" campaign.</i>

14:29.035 --> 14:32.035
<i>They embellished what
was a 20-year-old kid's role</i>

14:32.121 --> 14:34.581
<i>into being the
mastermind of Watergate.</i>

14:34.666 --> 14:38.706
Roger saw the opportunity
to build a reputation

14:38.795 --> 14:41.585
off of being viewed as that
politically significant.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.433
<i>Opponents
of Stone contend</i>

14:43.508 --> 14:46.388
<i>that his election is part of a
move by conservative activists</i>

14:46.469 --> 14:48.719
<i>to take over the
Republican Party.</i>

14:48.805 --> 14:50.345
<i>When
we elected Roger,</i>

14:50.431 --> 14:53.641
<i>we moved the Republican Party in
a more ideological direction.</i>

14:54.143 --> 14:58.023
Up until that point, it was straddling
the old Republican establishment

14:58.105 --> 15:01.895
<i>and the new conservative movement that
was started in Barry Goldwater days.</i>

15:01.984 --> 15:03.324
We built on that,

15:03.403 --> 15:06.783
and I think when Roger was elected
chairman of the Young Republicans,

15:06.864 --> 15:10.124
<i>you know, that was the piece
that finalized everything.</i>

15:10.201 --> 15:12.241
For many years, the
Republican Party

15:12.328 --> 15:17.038
<i>was associated with this sort of
good guy, Eisenhower earnestness.</i>

15:17.542 --> 15:19.132
What happened with the new right

15:19.210 --> 15:21.960
was there was a new generation
of people who said,

15:22.046 --> 15:25.546
"You know what? We're gonna fight
dirty and we're gonna win."

15:28.970 --> 15:32.720
Among the revolutionary changes in
American politics the past few years

15:32.807 --> 15:34.927
has been the rise of the
political action committees,

15:35.017 --> 15:38.347
called PACs, fund-raising
groups for special interests.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.608
<i>NCPAC,</i>

15:39.689 --> 15:43.029
<i>the National Conservative Political
Action Committee based in Virginia,</i>

15:43.109 --> 15:46.449
<i>rich in money, and dedicated to
doing in the nation's liberals.</i>

15:46.529 --> 15:50.869
<i>Even, its director Terry Dolan says, if
that means using the politics of fear.</i>

15:50.950 --> 15:52.660
I don't think there's
anything wrong with fear.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.000
<i>I met Terry Dolan</i>

15:55.079 --> 15:57.619
<i>when we were teenage Republicans
together in Connecticut.</i>

15:58.666 --> 16:00.836
<i>When we got married,
Terry was our best man.</i>

16:00.918 --> 16:03.798
<i>But more than that, he actually
ended up moving in with us.</i>

16:03.880 --> 16:05.340
We used to refer to
him as "the child."

16:05.422 --> 16:08.642
<i>It was on our living room
floor that NCPAC was born.</i>

16:08.718 --> 16:11.348
NCPAC, the National Conservative
Political Action Committee,

16:11.428 --> 16:14.388
is transformative in the sense
that we really pioneered

16:14.474 --> 16:18.354
<i>negative campaign advertising in
massive doses to win elections.</i>

16:18.435 --> 16:20.555
<i>Up to that time, it
really hadn't been done.</i>

16:20.647 --> 16:24.027
I came to Washington for
the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>

16:24.108 --> 16:27.148
in, um, the very end of 1983.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.196
And Roger was already
kind of a legend by then,

16:30.281 --> 16:31.951
kind of a dark
legend,

16:32.033 --> 16:36.663
<i>because of the negative ads
that he and NCPAC had run.</i>

16:36.746 --> 16:39.866
So people thought of him as kind
of a wizard behind the scenes.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.577
I remember meeting him on
the street and thinking,

16:41.668 --> 16:43.748
"Wow, that's Roger Stone."

16:43.836 --> 16:46.166
<i>Birch Bayh telling
us he's fighting inflation.</i>

16:46.255 --> 16:49.755
<i>The price tag on that
baloney is $46 billion.</i>

16:49.842 --> 16:52.602
<i>Because if Bayh wins, you lose.</i>

16:52.679 --> 16:55.009
The story of NCPAC is
that after Watergate,

16:55.097 --> 16:57.347
there were campaign
finance reforms

16:57.433 --> 17:01.813
<i>to try to control the corruption
in spending on politics.</i>

17:02.813 --> 17:05.073
<i>So what the Republicans did was,</i>

17:05.148 --> 17:08.189
they figured out a way
around the new rules.

17:08.778 --> 17:12.318
<i>The focus of NCPAC was
to use all the tools of a campaign,</i>

17:12.406 --> 17:13.826
but instead of
having a candidate,

17:13.907 --> 17:15.617
to use it through a PAC.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.040
<i>We could only
give a Senate campaign,</i>

17:19.121 --> 17:22.040
<i>in a direct financial
transfer of $5,000.</i>

17:22.541 --> 17:26.382
But the loophole was we could
advertise on behalf of a candidate,

17:26.462 --> 17:30.512
without their cooperation or
coordination, an unlimited amount.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.302
And that's why NCPAC
was successful.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.854
<i>It was a political
disaster for Senate Democrats.</i>

17:35.930 --> 17:37.770
<i>They not only lost
control of the Senate,</i>

17:37.849 --> 17:40.639
<i>they lost some of the biggest
names in the Democratic Party</i>

17:40.727 --> 17:42.897
<i>and many of their most
prominent liberals.</i>

17:42.979 --> 17:49.489
Regrettably, NCPAC consistently plays
to the dark side of human nature.

17:49.569 --> 17:55.409
Its stock-in-trade is the half-truth,
the innuendo, the distortion.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.491
<i>Power is
what PACs are about.</i>

17:57.577 --> 18:00.327
The power to raise and give
money to political candidates,

18:00.412 --> 18:02.542
who, in turn, will at
least give them a hearing

18:02.624 --> 18:03.964
and at best do their bidding.

18:04.041 --> 18:09.341
Roger was one of the inventors
of the modern political system.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.721
<i>The PACs, the super PACs.</i>

18:11.799 --> 18:14.589
<i>That is where Roger has
made his influence,</i>

18:14.677 --> 18:16.547
and it continues to be felt.

18:16.638 --> 18:20.098
I'm convinced that at some point,
with these types of programs,

18:20.182 --> 18:23.652
you could elect Mickey Mouse
to the House or the Senate.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.228
<i>Ronald
Reagan for president.</i>

18:25.312 --> 18:27.232
<i>He'll make America great again.</i>

18:27.940 --> 18:30.190
The district we're
in is Congressman Gary Lee.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.066
After this, we go to
the 32nd District,

18:32.153 --> 18:34.113
where those guys just got
knocked off the ballot.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.616
You're good at this.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.528
You must have had
some experience.

18:37.617 --> 18:41.157
<i>1980, Ronald Reagan
defeats Jimmy Carter.</i>

18:41.245 --> 18:44.575
I was running three
northeastern states for Reagan,

18:44.666 --> 18:46.376
as a regional
political director.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.088
<i>I think most observers
didn't recognize</i>

18:49.170 --> 18:50.960
<i>Reagan's enormous appeal</i>

18:51.047 --> 18:53.837
<i>to blue-collar Catholics
and working-class people.</i>

18:53.925 --> 18:57.675
And, of course, he carried all
three states and the presidency.

18:57.762 --> 19:01.932
And I'm proud of the fact that I
played some tiny, infinitesimal role

19:02.016 --> 19:05.186
in saving the United States
by electing Ronald Reagan.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.475
<i>The Reagan voter
is a blue-collar,</i>

19:08.564 --> 19:12.194
working-class, middle education,
middle-income-level voter.

19:12.276 --> 19:15.606
Roger identified the
Reagan Democrat.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.987
<i>He actually wrote
up the strategy</i>

19:18.074 --> 19:22.334
<i>for reaching out specifically to the
blue-collar and the Catholic vote.</i>

19:22.411 --> 19:27.711
He tends to be a second, third-generation
Catholic... Italian, Irish, Polish.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.542
<i>The Reagan Democrat
was a critical part</i>

19:29.626 --> 19:33.086
<i>of bringing over states that
normally would not vote Republican.</i>

19:33.589 --> 19:38.589
Let us pledge to each other,
with this great lady looking on,

19:39.220 --> 19:42.890
that we can, and so help us God,

19:42.974 --> 19:46.394
we will, make America
great again.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.597
Thank you very much.

19:59.782 --> 20:04.582
Roger is unique, in my experience,
because he actually embraces infamy.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.911
He doesn't worry that you
think he's a sleazeball.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.958
He wants you to think
he's a sleazeball.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.131
What a cheap, low-class
way to operate.

20:12.586 --> 20:16.256
Why do you embrace the
role of dirty trickster?

20:16.340 --> 20:17.470
Well, I'm stuck with it now.

20:17.549 --> 20:21.179
It's gonna be in the first paragraph
of my <i>New York Times</i> obit,

20:21.262 --> 20:22.932
so I might as well
go with the flow.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.434
The only thing I can think of
worse than being talked about...

20:26.017 --> 20:27.597
is not being talked about.

20:27.685 --> 20:30.055
<i>-# Used to be a fan of Bill </i>

20:30.146 --> 20:31.686
<i># Blue dresses And

20:31.772 --> 20:33.362
<i># Cigars and the

<i># Should have seen a

<i># Agency's drug plan expand </i>

20:46.454 --> 20:50.004
Now, Bill and Hillary Clinton
would steal a hot stove.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.632
These people are
career criminals,

20:52.709 --> 20:56.629
and thus far, the mainstream media
has helped conceal their crimes.

20:56.713 --> 20:59.883
But the truth will be
suppressed no longer.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.047
Lock her up!

21:02.136 --> 21:04.216
Stone and

God bless you. I'll be
happy to sign books

"For Roger, with fond memories and
the highest regard and affection

21:44.636 --> 21:49.016
for his good work in the 1980 campaign.
From a good friend, Roy Cohn."

21:50.601 --> 21:53.021
<i>This is a man that
everybody is going to enjoy meeting.</i>

21:53.104 --> 21:54.314
<i>He's Roy M. Cohn,</i>

21:54.396 --> 21:57.436
<i>who was confidential assistant to
the United States Attorney General.</i>

21:57.524 --> 22:01.864
<i>In 1953, Roy Cohn became
chief counsel to Senator Joe McCarthy's</i>

22:01.946 --> 22:04.486
<i>communist-hunting
investigations committee.</i>

22:04.573 --> 22:07.283
<i>His reign of televised
intimidation in the 1950s</i>

22:07.368 --> 22:12.538
<i>has become synonymous with demagoguery,
fearmongering and character assassination.</i>

22:12.623 --> 22:15.583
<i>Cohn went on to private
practice and made millions.</i>

22:15.667 --> 22:19.167
<i>He became one of the most politically
connected lawyers in the nation.</i>

22:19.255 --> 22:21.875
<i>The last two decades
of his career were marred</i>

22:21.966 --> 22:25.176
<i>by allegations of fraud,
blackmail and perjury.</i>

22:25.261 --> 22:29.891
When I was assigned New York
for Ronald Reagan in 1979,

22:29.974 --> 22:31.484
for the 1980 election,

22:31.558 --> 22:35.518
shortly thereafter I was
invited to a dinner party

22:35.604 --> 22:38.324
being thrown by a
Washington socialite...

22:38.399 --> 22:40.359
who, in all honesty, I
was trying to lay...

22:41.568 --> 22:43.568
<i>and Cohn was present.</i>

22:43.654 --> 22:45.074
<i>So I made my way up to him.</i>

22:45.156 --> 22:49.576
I introduced myself. I said, "Mr.
Cohn, I'm... I'm Roger Stone."

22:49.660 --> 22:50.660
He looked at me and said,

22:51.578 --> 22:54.538
"Are you the son or the
grandson of the Roger Stone

22:54.623 --> 22:57.173
who's running the Reagan
campaign here in New York?"

22:57.251 --> 22:59.251
I said, "No, that's me."

22:59.336 --> 23:02.416
He turns to his partner Tom Bolan.
He says, "Reagan's in trouble."

23:05.467 --> 23:07.427
<i>I wrote a lot about Roy Cohn.</i>

23:07.929 --> 23:11.309
I started hearing about Roger from
people who were close to Roy.

23:12.516 --> 23:16.436
<i>Roy Cohn is the single most evil
person I have ever covered.</i>

23:16.645 --> 23:22.815
If that's a magnet for you as a young man,
it says you're soulless before you start.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.819
Well, my attitude regarding
those who criticize me

23:25.905 --> 23:29.905
for being friends with Roy Cohn
or Richard Nixon is... fuck 'em.

23:30.784 --> 23:34.164
<i>Roger's relationship with
Cohn was, in part, mentor.</i>

23:34.246 --> 23:36.366
<i>Cohn had a slice of history,</i>

23:37.083 --> 23:41.133
<i>and a circle of friends that would not
have necessarily been part of our orbit.</i>

23:41.212 --> 23:42.672
<i>It's how we met Trump.</i>

23:43.755 --> 23:48.835
Donald Trump is probably one of the
most important names in America today.

23:48.927 --> 23:52.257
He is, as I say, the closest thing to
a genius I've ever met in my life.

23:52.348 --> 23:55.348
On "Special Segment" tonight,
Mike Jensen profiles a man

23:55.434 --> 23:56.894
who, at the age of 39,

23:56.978 --> 24:00.648
is not content with being New York
City's latest real estate billionaire.

24:00.731 --> 24:04.651
Donald Trump has also ventured into
gambling and professional football

24:04.735 --> 24:08.315
and says he could negotiate a nuclear
disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union.

24:08.405 --> 24:11.365
<i>Donald Trump, a
tough man in a tough city.</i>

24:11.450 --> 24:14.080
Steve, you're gonna have to
start pushing these people now,

24:14.161 --> 24:16.661
'cause it's getting a little
ridiculous, as far as I'm concerned.

24:16.747 --> 24:19.207
<i>At the age of 39,
Donald Trump has become</i>

24:19.291 --> 24:22.751
<i>one of America's best known
and most successful builders.</i>

24:22.836 --> 24:27.046
<i>And, not surprisingly, he has an
ego almost as big as his empire.</i>

24:27.133 --> 24:30.393
I had a lawyer, who was a very
good lawyer, tough lawyer,

24:30.469 --> 24:31.639
<i>named Roy Cohn.</i>

24:31.720 --> 24:35.600
<i>He introduced me, at one
point, to Roger Stone.</i>

24:35.682 --> 24:37.932
Roy thought Roger was
a very tough guy.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.269
Roy knew some very tough
guys, I will tell you that,

24:40.354 --> 24:43.074
but Roy always felt that
Roger was not only tough,

24:43.149 --> 24:45.479
but a smart guy and
very political.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.937
<i>Trump is an expert
at getting what he wants,</i>

24:48.029 --> 24:50.109
<i>particularly from politicians.</i>

24:50.197 --> 24:52.817
<i>He's gotten tax abatements
and other concessions.</i>

24:52.908 --> 24:55.948
<i>Politicians have gotten
campaign contributions.</i>

24:56.037 --> 24:57.037
<i>Big ones.</i>

24:57.704 --> 25:00.124
<i>Roger's the first one
who introduced us to Donald,</i>

25:00.207 --> 25:03.587
and Donald was one of our clients
at Black, Manafort, Stone

25:03.669 --> 25:06.919
<i>in the early '80s and was a
client of ours for a long time.</i>

25:13.887 --> 25:16.637
<i>In the early days of
the Reagan administration,</i>

25:16.723 --> 25:20.023
<i>Roger was so prominent
and so successful,</i>

25:20.102 --> 25:24.322
<i>he could have become a sort
of great man of the party.</i>

25:24.398 --> 25:26.188
<i>He was a real insider.</i>

25:26.275 --> 25:29.395
<i>He was a political
consultant, a lobbyist,</i>

25:29.486 --> 25:31.406
<i>someone who was right
in the thick of things.</i>

25:31.488 --> 25:33.278
Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and I

25:33.365 --> 25:36.485
had worked together through
the Reagan campaign.

25:36.577 --> 25:39.157
<i>When the Reagan campaign
got short of cash,</i>

25:39.246 --> 25:41.916
<i>and decided to start a
political consulting firm.</i>

25:41.998 --> 25:44.248
<i>Paul Manafort came
in one day and said,</i>

25:44.335 --> 25:46.245
<i>"You know, we ought to
start a lobbying firm,</i>

25:46.337 --> 25:49.877
because I'm getting a lot of calls from
people who know we all work for Reagan

25:49.965 --> 25:52.925
and know the people who are gonna
be in the Reagan administration,

25:53.009 --> 25:54.549
and they want lobbying."

25:54.636 --> 25:55.636
So we did.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.725
Good to see you.
- This is Paul Manafort.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.138
<i>What
we were doing was</i>

26:01.227 --> 26:04.267
<i>trying to use our relationships
that we had built up,</i>

26:04.355 --> 26:07.645
first through the Young Republicans
and then through NCPAC,

26:07.733 --> 26:10.903
<i>and to create a business that would
focus on political consulting.</i>

26:10.986 --> 26:14.486
<i>Lobbying had been
considered kind of a sleazy business,</i>

26:14.573 --> 26:18.453
but Roger Stone unabashedly
came out and said,

26:18.535 --> 26:22.615
"I'm gonna make a pile of money
off this and no apologies."

26:23.707 --> 26:26.417
Black, Manafort &
Stone was the shit.

26:26.502 --> 26:30.552
It was the biggest, most powerful
lobbying operation in Washington.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.965
<i>We did things that nobody
else had ever done.</i>

26:34.051 --> 26:35.931
<i># That's the way you do it </i>

26:36.011 --> 26:39.061
<i># Money for nothin' And
your chicks for free </i>

26:39.139 --> 26:40.929
<i># Money for nothin' </i>

26:42.893 --> 26:44.603
<i># And your chicks for free </i>

26:46.480 --> 26:48.270
<i># Money for nothin' </i>

26:49.983 --> 26:51.783
<i># And your chicks for free </i>

26:52.277 --> 26:53.697
<i># Look at that Look at that </i>

26:53.779 --> 26:55.779
<i># Money for nothin' </i>

26:57.407 --> 26:58.947
<i># And your chicks for free </i>

27:00.702 --> 27:02.872
<i>There were a
lot of gray people</i>

27:02.954 --> 27:06.044
<i>in gray suits and tan
raincoats in Washington.</i>

27:06.124 --> 27:08.714
<i>They were all sort
of interchangeable.</i>

27:08.794 --> 27:10.844
<i>And then you had Roger Stone.</i>

27:10.921 --> 27:16.091
And when he went to fancy parties, he
wore black patent leather slippers.

27:16.177 --> 27:18.297
He was a whole new
level of, sort of,

27:18.387 --> 27:21.137
splash and show business
and money and glitz.

27:22.599 --> 27:23.849
<i># Money for nothin' </i>

27:23.934 --> 27:25.604
<i>Joining us now, Roger Stone,</i>

27:25.686 --> 27:29.146
who belongs to one of Washington's
most successful consulting firms.

27:29.231 --> 27:32.231
The argument, I gather, seems to
be that you helped elect 'em,

27:32.318 --> 27:34.318
and now you're helping
to tell them what to do,

27:34.403 --> 27:36.953
and this really isn't what the
Founding Fathers had in mind.

27:37.030 --> 27:41.580
First of all, the term "influence
shops" is really not accurate at all.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.540
I think that what we
provide for our clients,

27:43.620 --> 27:47.210
be them foreign countries or
corporations or individuals,

27:47.291 --> 27:50.381
is a superior understanding
of how Washington works.

27:50.461 --> 27:52.591
<i>Before Black,
Manafort & Stone,</i>

27:52.671 --> 27:57.631
it was considered somewhat
distasteful for campaign types

27:57.718 --> 28:00.008
to immediately go into lobbying,

28:00.095 --> 28:02.675
<i>trying to influence the
people they just elected.</i>

28:03.307 --> 28:06.977
<i>What Black, Manafort & Stone
said was, "We're unapologetic.</i>

28:07.561 --> 28:10.561
<i>We got this guy elected, and
now we're going to make money</i>

28:10.647 --> 28:13.317
<i>by charging for access
to his administration."</i>

28:13.817 --> 28:19.567
There's been a massive expansion of
the lobbying sector in Washington.

28:19.656 --> 28:22.276
Some of them are so
powerful and successful

28:22.368 --> 28:23.368
that we don't question it.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.542
We just assume it's a fact
of American political life.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.670
<i>Black, Manafort &
Stone, in their brazenness,</i>

28:29.750 --> 28:34.000
really created the modern
sleazeball lobbyist.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.297
<i>They elected people.</i>

28:35.380 --> 28:38.090
<i>As soon as those people were
in office, they lobbied them.</i>

28:38.174 --> 28:41.474
<i>And so they crossed a line
that hadn't been crossed.</i>

28:41.553 --> 28:43.813
Washington's been worse
for it ever since.

28:43.889 --> 28:46.979
<i>Paul Manafort of
Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly</i>

28:47.058 --> 28:49.308
<i>stands with his partners
at the receiving end</i>

28:49.395 --> 28:51.855
<i>of $31 million in subsidies.</i>

28:51.938 --> 28:53.608
I will stipulate for
the purpose of today

28:53.690 --> 28:55.690
that you could characterize
this as influence peddling.

28:55.776 --> 28:56.936
Thank you.

28:57.027 --> 28:59.277
I will bring new
people to Washington.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.573
People that come there to
serve and not to profit.

29:02.658 --> 29:06.948
We will have the highest
possible ethical standards.

29:07.037 --> 29:08.577
We're gonna bring in the best.

29:08.664 --> 29:09.674
<i>The best?</i>

29:09.748 --> 29:12.168
<i>Charles Black is a
senior advisor to Bush.</i>

29:12.251 --> 29:14.091
<i>So are Paul Manafort
and Roger Stone.</i>

29:14.711 --> 29:17.381
<i>And Lee Atwater is George
Bush's campaign manager.</i>

29:17.464 --> 29:21.344
<i>All these men are partners
in a firm that, in 1985,</i>

29:21.427 --> 29:25.347
<i>received $3.4 million in
foreign lobbying fees.</i>

29:25.431 --> 29:29.101
Black, Manafort & Stone saw
a business opportunity

29:29.184 --> 29:31.694
in being the torturers' lobby.

29:31.770 --> 29:35.860
<i>In representing the most
distasteful dictators,</i>

29:35.941 --> 29:39.991
<i>Mobutu, Marcos, UNITA in Angola.</i>

29:40.654 --> 29:46.744
<i>They did not care about being
acceptable in the salons of Georgetown.</i>

29:46.827 --> 29:49.367
They cared about making money.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.325
You know, one man's freedom fighter
is another man's terrorist.

29:52.416 --> 29:55.916
<i>There are reports of gross
human rights abuses in rebel-held areas,</i>

29:56.002 --> 29:59.592
<i>including the burning alive of
Savimbi's political opponents.</i>

29:59.673 --> 30:01.263
The Cold War was going on.

30:01.925 --> 30:04.215
<i>You know, I'll take criticism
if they give it to Reagan</i>

30:04.303 --> 30:06.893
and the majority of Congress
who put the funding in.

30:06.972 --> 30:10.682
<i>Tens of thousands of men have
been killed or wounded in the fighting.</i>

30:10.767 --> 30:14.607
<i>The US missiles will escalate the
war even to a more deadly level.</i>

30:14.688 --> 30:17.268
When people think of
Washington corruption,

30:17.358 --> 30:21.108
they think of organizations
like Black, Manafort & Stone,

30:21.194 --> 30:24.164
that shook down dictators,
took all their money,

30:24.239 --> 30:27.449
and then tried to take
America's government

30:27.534 --> 30:29.954
and make them serve the
dictators' interest.

30:30.036 --> 30:32.746
You know, it is the swamp.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.331
I'm proud of the job I did
at Black, Manafort & Stone,

30:35.417 --> 30:37.167
because I made a lot of money,

30:37.252 --> 30:41.422
and I can't think of anything I did
that was either illegal or immoral.

30:41.507 --> 30:44.257
You play by the rules
as they're written.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.683
When they change the rules, you
change the way you play the game.

30:49.348 --> 30:54.098
<i>When you talk to Roger
about his business and morality,</i>

30:54.185 --> 30:57.055
he sees morality as a
synonym for weakness.

30:57.147 --> 31:01.317
That's something that he's always
going to have contempt for.

31:05.864 --> 31:10.044
<i>Those who say I have no soul,
those who say I have no principles,</i>

31:10.118 --> 31:12.118
are losers. Those
are bitter losers.

31:12.203 --> 31:15.293
Everything I have done,
everything I have worked for,

31:15.374 --> 31:19.424
is to propel ideas and
a political philosophy

31:19.503 --> 31:21.513
that I want to see
dominant in government.

31:22.088 --> 31:26.178
<i>Donald Trump has now elevated
the issues that I believe in.</i>

31:26.259 --> 31:30.469
Anti-elitism, that was first
identified by Richard Nixon...

31:30.556 --> 31:34.096
To you, the great
silent majority...

31:34.184 --> 31:35.854
<i>...mined by
Ronald Reagan...</i>

31:35.936 --> 31:39.356
Government is not the
solution to our problem,

31:39.440 --> 31:41.440
government is the problem.

31:41.525 --> 31:42.935
<i>...and now Donald Trump.</i>

31:43.026 --> 31:47.986
The silent majority is back, and
we're gonna take the country back.

31:49.866 --> 31:55.456
The image they have of politics
is a dirty image of politics.

31:55.539 --> 31:58.669
It's that, um,
everybody's for sale.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.590
When Trump talks
about, you know,

32:00.669 --> 32:04.089
"I gave my money 'cause I thought
I might need a favor later."

32:04.172 --> 32:05.802
Everyone's for sale.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.802
Nobody's there to serve
the public good.

32:08.885 --> 32:13.095
It's an anti-government view and
an anti-political view and, um...

32:13.181 --> 32:15.851
very lacking in
idealism, very cynical.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.564
<i>There's no nobility in it.</i>

32:17.644 --> 32:18.654
The money in politics?

32:18.728 --> 32:21.768
Well, I think there should be,
frankly, more transparency.

32:22.315 --> 32:25.395
Because I see a guy like Jeb
Bush with $114 million,

32:25.486 --> 32:26.606
which is now higher,

32:26.695 --> 32:28.655
and nobody even knows
who put the money in.

32:28.739 --> 32:31.659
And they all control him
like a little puppet, okay?

32:31.742 --> 32:32.782
I know half of the people.

32:32.868 --> 32:34.868
I don't know who they are
because I can't find it out.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.543
But as soon as I do, I
will know most of 'em.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.833
They're friends of mine.
I used to be there.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.786
I used to be the
king at that, okay?

32:48.133 --> 32:52.893
<i>In 1981, Roger runs Tom Kean's
campaign for governor in New Jersey.</i>

32:52.971 --> 32:55.141
Donald is just
really getting into

32:55.223 --> 32:57.933
the throes of casino
life in Atlantic City,

32:58.018 --> 33:00.938
<i>so they came together
on a common agenda.</i>

33:01.021 --> 33:03.151
<i>Trump gave him
a lot of casino business.</i>

33:03.231 --> 33:06.441
Roger and Trump, peas
in a pod, you know?

33:06.527 --> 33:10.777
Trump is someone, through the '80s, who
took enormous risks and succeeded.

33:10.864 --> 33:15.294
Roger represented Donald Trump
from Donald Trump's earliest days.

33:15.869 --> 33:20.249
<i>Then the Ethics Commission made a
finding against Donald Trump and him</i>

33:20.331 --> 33:23.251
<i>for all of the illegal
things that they did.</i>

33:24.586 --> 33:28.546
When Roger wants something,
he pursues it with vigor.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.010
Now politics, sort of.

33:31.092 --> 33:34.102
New York developer Donald Trump
caused a stir this morning

33:34.179 --> 33:36.719
when he took out an ad
in some major newspapers

33:36.807 --> 33:40.097
<i>charging American foreign
policy lacks backbone.</i>

33:40.185 --> 33:43.185
<i>Immediately the question came up,
is he running for something?</i>

33:43.271 --> 33:48.071
In 1987, I suggested that Trump should
explore a bid for the presidency.

33:48.151 --> 33:51.031
This sounds like political
presidential talk to me,

33:51.112 --> 33:54.582
and I know that people have talked to you
about if you wanna run. Would you ever?

33:54.658 --> 33:58.118
Probably not, but I do get tired of
seeing what's happening with this country.

33:58.203 --> 34:00.913
And if it got so bad, I would
never wanna rule it out totally,

34:00.997 --> 34:04.247
because I really am tired of seeing
what's happening with this country.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.044
I was like a jockey
looking for a horse.

34:06.127 --> 34:08.417
You can't win the race if
you don't have a horse,

34:08.504 --> 34:11.264
and he is a prime piece of
political horseflesh in my view.

34:15.178 --> 34:18.558
<i>I interceded with the Portsmouth,
New Hampshire Chamber of Commerce</i>

34:18.639 --> 34:20.230
<i>to arrange a lunch.</i>

34:20.516 --> 34:24.146
<i>The helicopter landing was
as big a news as his speech.</i>

34:24.771 --> 34:27.771
<i>This is kind of the first time
I saw the power of Trump.</i>

34:28.358 --> 34:31.987
<i>The public interest in
Trump was palpable.</i>

34:32.070 --> 34:33.070
<i>It was, like, electric.</i>

34:33.154 --> 34:35.704
<i>And he lit the place on fire.</i>

34:35.782 --> 34:38.621
I'm not here today because I'm
running for the presidency.

34:38.702 --> 34:41.292
I'm here because I'm
personally tired

34:41.371 --> 34:44.210
of seeing this great country
of ours being ripped off.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.960
Roger always wanted me
to run for president.

34:47.043 --> 34:50.422
And in 1988, he wanted me to
run, but I had no interest.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.005
I did a book called
<i>The Art of the Deal,</i>

34:52.090 --> 34:54.469
which was the number one
best-seller of the year.

34:54.550 --> 34:55.550
<i>It was a tremendous book.</i>

34:55.636 --> 34:59.346
Roger wanted me to run so badly,
and I just didn't want to do it.

34:59.430 --> 35:02.520
What I want is, I want
extreme competence.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.481
I want strength and
extreme competence.

35:05.561 --> 35:08.441
<i>In 1988, when I was
at the New Orleans convention,</i>

35:08.523 --> 35:10.943
<i>Roger Stone had me setting up
chairs in a reception room</i>

35:11.026 --> 35:14.946
for an executive out of New York who
I didn't really know, Donald Trump.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.490
<i>Even though his candidate
for president, Jack Kemp,</i>

35:17.573 --> 35:19.993
<i>had the possibility of being
selected as vice president,</i>

35:20.076 --> 35:22.786
he was squiring Donald Trump
around the convention.

35:22.871 --> 35:26.041
You have said that if you ran
for president, you'd win.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.294
I'd have a very good chance.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.455
I like to win. When I do
something, I like to win.

35:29.544 --> 35:33.054
I like to do well, and I think I probably
would have a pretty good chance.

35:33.131 --> 35:36.511
Roger saw the value of
the outsider image.

35:36.592 --> 35:38.642
He saw the value of somebody

35:38.720 --> 35:41.640
<i>who brought business experience
to the political process.</i>

35:42.140 --> 35:45.190
<i>He saw something that nobody
else saw back in the early '80s.</i>

35:45.268 --> 35:47.478
<i>Once he'd had conversations
with Trump about that,</i>

35:47.562 --> 35:50.022
Trump started to take seriously
that maybe he should run.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.816
So long.
Thanks a lot, folks.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.004
Florida is a great
place to live.

36:13.088 --> 36:15.338
It's a sunny place
for shady people.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.183
<i>Welcome to Casa del Stone.</i>

36:18.259 --> 36:23.259
This is, uh, where I live with my
wife, three cats and three dogs.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.228
And my 91-year-old mother.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.938
Tough as nails.

36:27.018 --> 36:31.228
If you ever saw <i>The Sopranos</i> and
you're familiar with Tony's mother,

36:31.314 --> 36:32.734
that's my mother.

36:32.816 --> 36:35.396
These guys are liberal filmmakers.
They cannot be trusted.

36:35.485 --> 36:36.485
Hi.

36:36.569 --> 36:37.569
Come here, Sambo.

36:37.653 --> 36:40.283
Sammy is, uh... He's not well.

36:40.991 --> 36:42.081
He's been losing weight.

36:42.158 --> 36:44.618
And we've been taking him
back and forth to the vet.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.503
Come here, baby. Give me a kiss.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.289
Give me a kiss. No kiss?
No kiss?

36:48.373 --> 36:49.583
Okay.

36:49.665 --> 36:50.665
This is my wife.

36:50.751 --> 36:52.711
We met working on the
Reagan campaign,

36:52.794 --> 36:56.764
where she was employed as a
photographer for the campaign

36:56.840 --> 37:00.340
and I was working for Reagan as
a regional political director.

37:00.426 --> 37:03.256
This is the designated
smoking area.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.636
Kind of a contemplative garden.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.431
What do you
contemplate out here?

37:08.518 --> 37:11.308
Political strategy and
destroying my enemies.

37:12.063 --> 37:15.653
And now may I introduce Mr.
Roger Stone to all of you.

37:21.156 --> 37:26.236
Bill Clinton is a Bill
Cosby-style sexual predator,

37:26.327 --> 37:32.497
who has preyed on probably hundreds,
but at least 27, individual women.

37:32.583 --> 37:36.003
If Bill Cosby is going to be held
responsible for his actions,

37:36.087 --> 37:39.377
then Bill Clinton should be held
responsible for his actions.

37:41.217 --> 37:45.307
Bill and Hillary Clinton are the
penicillin-resistant syphilis

37:45.388 --> 37:47.428
of the American body politic.

37:48.516 --> 37:51.186
...everything you're doing.
- Thank you very much. You, too.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.309
Hey, sir.
- How ya doing?

37:52.395 --> 37:53.395
Pleasure.
- Good to see you.

37:53.479 --> 37:55.479
This is my daughter
and my granddaughter.

37:57.317 --> 37:59.687
Hello. How are you?

37:59.778 --> 38:01.028
I'm excellent.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.992
Thanks for coming.
- Of course. Of course.

38:03.073 --> 38:04.493
I was going to point out that...

38:04.574 --> 38:06.534
<i>There's a side of
him that they don't see.</i>

38:06.617 --> 38:09.367
The side we get to see. The
family side, the loving side.

38:10.705 --> 38:14.625
That persona of the dirty trickster
is not what we see at home.

38:14.709 --> 38:17.049
We do see the trickster.
Yeah.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.758
Hold up your lens up
here just a little higher.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.799
Little higher. Little higher.
Little higher.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.760
Yeah, that's it. Okay!

38:25.678 --> 38:28.678
<i>I was actually terrified
of him the first time I met him.</i>

38:28.764 --> 38:31.354
I walked in his office,
and I told him later

38:31.434 --> 38:33.444
that he looked like a
Nazi Hitler Youth.

38:33.519 --> 38:36.109
Nydia taught me how to
smile and how to laugh.

38:36.189 --> 38:40.279
Uh, and she's made me a better person.
And I'm not complete without her.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.110
You're a Buddhist. Do you
think that you centered Roger?

38:43.196 --> 38:45.026
Yes. - She
certainly has tried.

38:45.531 --> 38:49.201
And I think, in some cases, she
has been effective in doing so.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.615
Centered and censored.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.124
And sometimes I need both.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.669
<i>And with Nydia, I
got instant family.</i>

38:56.751 --> 38:58.921
<i>I got children. I
got grandchildren.</i>

38:59.004 --> 39:00.384
<i>I got a mother-in-law.</i>

39:00.463 --> 39:02.593
All things that I didn't
have with my first wife.

39:02.673 --> 39:05.093
So I became a family
man overnight.

39:08.138 --> 39:10.268
He is a political strategist,

39:10.348 --> 39:14.348
and he was just named the senior advisor
to the Dole presidential campaign.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.095
That should be an interesting
job in the next few months.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.517
Roger Stone!

39:18.606 --> 39:19.606
Roger...

39:20.691 --> 39:22.941
I think we've got this
figured out. We've got the slogan.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.398
"Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.

39:24.487 --> 39:27.367
Together they offer the people
133 years of experience."

39:29.159 --> 39:32.039
We want Bob!
We want Bob!

39:32.120 --> 39:33.330
Thank you.

39:33.413 --> 39:38.003
I can't imagine Roger being less excited
to work with a presidential candidate

39:38.084 --> 39:39.464
than he was with Bob Dole.

39:39.544 --> 39:43.424
There are endless reasons to end the
failed presidency of Bill Clinton.

39:43.506 --> 39:48.046
But renewing the strength of America by
restoring our social and moral order

39:48.136 --> 39:51.006
has got to be somewhere
near the top of that list.

39:51.097 --> 39:54.637
The Dole-Kemp ticket was still
counting on the evangelical vote

39:54.725 --> 39:55.725
to defeat the Clintons.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.900
In fact, if you look at
the numbers back then,

39:57.979 --> 40:00.649
there was no way they could win
unless they had that vote.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.111
There's no doubt about it

40:02.192 --> 40:05.282
that many American people have
lost their faith in government.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.494
They see scandals almost
on a daily basis.

40:09.574 --> 40:12.744
<i>They see ethical problems
in the White House today.</i>

40:13.244 --> 40:14.874
<i>Do you think that's
a legitimate issue?</i>

40:14.954 --> 40:17.584
I do. I think the character of the
president of the United States--

40:17.665 --> 40:19.875
Do you think this
issue of marital fidelity,

40:19.959 --> 40:22.299
which you keep blaming on the
media, is a legitimate issue?

40:22.378 --> 40:25.008
This is something the voters are
gonna wanna know about, yeah.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.379
<i>Roger
could have become</i>

40:26.466 --> 40:29.256
much more successful in
conventional terms than he did.

40:29.344 --> 40:32.314
And the reason he didn't is
because he self-sabotaged.

40:32.388 --> 40:33.848
<i>There was once a time</i>

40:33.932 --> 40:37.022
when political consultants
were unknown and unseen.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.102
No more.

40:40.355 --> 40:44.225
<i>Some of the tabloids say a
Republican strategist, Roger Stone,</i>

40:44.317 --> 40:46.737
<i>a partner in the prestigious
Washington lobbying firm</i>

40:46.819 --> 40:48.449
<i>of Davis, Manafort & Stone,</i>

40:48.529 --> 40:51.069
<i>has been advertising for
sex in swinger magazines</i>

40:51.157 --> 40:52.777
<i>along with his wife, Nydia.</i>

40:54.660 --> 40:56.160
<i>He joins us from Washington.</i>

40:56.246 --> 40:58.206
<i>-Good to have you with us.</i>
- <i>Surely.</i>

40:58.289 --> 40:59.289
<i>Do I quote
you correctly,</i>

40:59.374 --> 41:01.674
<i>that these ads were planted by
someone else out to get you?</i>

41:01.751 --> 41:03.341
Yes, indeed, um...

41:03.419 --> 41:05.589
An exhaustive investigation
now indicates

41:05.672 --> 41:09.722
that a domestic employee who I
discharged for substance abuse...

41:09.801 --> 41:13.551
on the second time that we learned
that he had a drug problem,

41:13.638 --> 41:15.268
is the perpetrator.

41:15.931 --> 41:19.391
<i>I'm deeply troubled by this
notion of paid sources</i>

41:19.477 --> 41:22.607
who can say anything
anonymously about you.

41:22.688 --> 41:25.608
Provide no photographs,
no proof, no documents.

41:25.691 --> 41:26.781
You know, it's very hard.

41:26.859 --> 41:30.239
My granddaughter, who's seven years
old, said to my wife on Sunday,

41:30.321 --> 41:32.531
"Why are they doing
this to you, Grandma?"

41:32.615 --> 41:34.365
It's a very hard
question to answer.

41:34.450 --> 41:36.580
<i>All right,
appreciate you joining us.</i>

41:36.661 --> 41:38.451
Thanks for being here.
<i>- Glad to be here.</i>

41:38.538 --> 41:42.248
Roger Stone's first
impulse was to deny.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.343
In fact, if you look
at Stone's Rules,

41:44.419 --> 41:47.339
one of the rules is
"deny, deny, deny, deny."

41:47.422 --> 41:49.342
And he began by following
his own rules.

41:49.424 --> 41:52.594
'Cause it wasn't until much later that
he admitted that everything was true.

41:52.677 --> 41:55.007
The <i>National Enquirer</i> scandal,

41:55.096 --> 41:58.266
which I'm not interested in
rehashing at great length,

41:58.433 --> 42:01.893
uh, probably required that I
be even more of an outlaw.

42:01.977 --> 42:04.477
I never ran for public office.

42:04.564 --> 42:09.114
So how I conduct myself in my
private life is nobody's business.

42:09.194 --> 42:11.404
Did you hear about this?
This guy, Roger Stone,

42:11.487 --> 42:14.237
top Republican advisor
for Bob Dole,

42:14.324 --> 42:17.834
has now been accused of going
to sex clubs with his wife.

42:17.910 --> 42:19.410
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

42:19.495 --> 42:23.995
On the other hand, this gives you an idea
how conservative the Dole campaign is.

42:24.667 --> 42:27.247
This guy is in trouble for
having sex with his wife!

42:27.337 --> 42:29.917
That's how conservative
those people are. Having...

42:32.800 --> 42:35.930
<i>I think something snapped in
him when the swinger scandal happened,</i>

42:36.011 --> 42:37.641
<i>and he got chased
out of Washington.</i>

42:37.722 --> 42:41.772
And he just said, "Eff this. What
do I need this for anymore?"

42:41.851 --> 42:43.481
What the '96 scandal meant

42:43.561 --> 42:46.731
is that Roger was never gonna be
the out-front political genius.

42:46.814 --> 42:49.654
<i>The Karl Rove, the
David Axelrod.</i>

42:49.734 --> 42:52.614
He was always gonna have
to operate in the shadows.

42:52.695 --> 42:55.525
If it weren't for 1996 and
all the trouble he had,

42:55.615 --> 42:59.025
maybe Roger wouldn't have
embraced the kind of, you know,

42:59.119 --> 43:01.999
darker side of his
capacity, of his talents.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.500
If there hadn't been a
sex scandal in 1996,

43:04.582 --> 43:06.462
we might have had a
President Al Gore.

43:12.757 --> 43:15.507
They always return to
the scene of the crime.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.505
We want Bush!

43:19.597 --> 43:22.477
We want Bush! We want Bush!

43:22.558 --> 43:24.978
We want Gore! We want Gore!

43:25.060 --> 43:29.520
This is where the recount of the 2000
presidential contest took place.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.357
This is where the recount ended.

43:31.442 --> 43:35.782
This is where George W. Bush became
president of the United States.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.873
<i>Good grief.
Look at that. Eleven.</i>

43:37.948 --> 43:39.948
<i>Eleven. That
means automatic recount.</i>

43:40.034 --> 43:41.834
<i>There is one state
left to be decided,</i>

43:41.911 --> 43:44.461
<i>and we believe when
those votes are counted</i>

43:44.539 --> 43:47.379
<i>and that process is
complete, totally complete,</i>

43:47.458 --> 43:50.298
Al Gore will have won the Electoral
College and the popular vote

43:50.378 --> 43:52.668
and, therefore, is... will
be the next president.

43:52.755 --> 43:56.425
<i>The hand recount in Florida
will continue, and the votes will count.</i>

43:56.509 --> 43:59.849
<i>That, according to a unanimous ruling
from Florida Supreme Court last night.</i>

43:59.929 --> 44:02.059
<i>Vice President Al Gore praised
the decision, saying,</i>

44:02.140 --> 44:05.100
<i>"It allows for a full and accurate
counting of the ballots."</i>

44:05.185 --> 44:07.935
This is a street fight for the
presidency of the United States.

44:08.020 --> 44:11.980
I want our protestors down there in
Palm Beach, Tallahassee, and Miami.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.066
Call Roger Stone.

44:13.151 --> 44:16.111
<i>In 2000, my old
friend Jim Baker called me</i>

44:16.196 --> 44:20.486
<i>and asked me to go to Miami-Dade
to work on the recount.</i>

44:20.575 --> 44:24.115
I thought it was vitally important
that we matched the Democrats

44:24.204 --> 44:28.834
<i>in terms of protesters who wanted an
end to the 2000 presidential election.</i>

44:28.916 --> 44:31.586
This country was born
on civil disobedience

44:31.669 --> 44:34.879
and the will of the people
standing up against the powerful!

44:34.964 --> 44:37.344
There's nothing wrong with
Clinton getting his dick sucked

44:37.425 --> 44:39.255
in the middle of the
Oval Office, is there?

44:39.344 --> 44:40.934
This is where the
trailer was set up

44:41.011 --> 44:44.311
to communicate with our
operatives inside the building.

44:45.015 --> 44:46.385
He's got a ballot!

44:47.101 --> 44:48.061
He stole a ballot!

44:48.686 --> 44:50.806
<i>When some of
my operatives reported</i>

44:50.896 --> 44:52.226
<i>that two democratic
commissioners</i>

44:52.315 --> 44:54.855
<i>were attempting to take
a sheaf of ballots,</i>

44:54.942 --> 44:56.782
<i>remove them from
the counting room,</i>

44:56.861 --> 45:00.701
which was being viewed by reporters
and lawyers for both sides,

45:00.781 --> 45:04.291
and take them to a small
anteroom without windows,

45:04.369 --> 45:08.209
this is what sparked the
so-called Brooks Brothers Riot.

45:09.832 --> 45:13.592
<i>I said, "Flood the hall and
don't let them shut that door."</i>

45:13.669 --> 45:16.009
Let us in!
Let us in!

45:16.088 --> 45:17.668
<i>They started
banging on the doors</i>

45:17.757 --> 45:22.717
<i>and were intimidating the people who
were counting the ballots to stop.</i>

45:22.803 --> 45:24.763
<i>And they did stop.</i>

45:24.847 --> 45:28.137
So Al Gore could not
gain any votes.

45:29.352 --> 45:35.362
That was critical in making sure
that the results in Florida,

45:35.441 --> 45:38.531
certifying George Bush
as the winner, stood.

45:38.611 --> 45:40.531
Let us in!
Let us in!

45:40.613 --> 45:46.623
Most people, they want to underplay
anything they did wrong or improper.

45:46.702 --> 45:49.002
And with Roger, what you
have to worry about

45:49.079 --> 45:54.289
is that he's lying to make himself
worse than he actually was.

45:54.377 --> 45:57.837
The history of the 2000 recount was
essentially written by Roger Stone,

45:57.922 --> 46:01.342
and he wrote himself in,
in a pretty big role.

46:01.426 --> 46:04.086
<i>He was sitting next to Washington
as they crossed the Delaware.</i>

46:04.178 --> 46:06.638
<i>He was with Eisenhower on D-Day.</i>

46:06.722 --> 46:10.062
<i>He was cradling Bobby Kennedy in the
kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel.</i>

46:10.142 --> 46:13.772
I mean, he really
sort of put himself there.

46:13.854 --> 46:15.154
I mean, Roger was there.

46:15.815 --> 46:17.225
But let me ask you,

46:17.317 --> 46:21.027
is it more brilliant and impressive
to influence world events

46:21.111 --> 46:24.161
or to stand on the
periphery of world events

46:24.239 --> 46:27.489
and yet get recorded as having
influenced world events?

46:27.576 --> 46:28.536
Maybe the latter.

46:29.036 --> 46:31.616
Yeah, I think he played a role
in the Brooks Brothers Riot.

46:31.706 --> 46:33.326
I don't dispute that.

46:33.416 --> 46:35.286
But I'm the only one to approach

46:35.376 --> 46:39.756
what I think is the best story
I've ever done on Roger.

46:40.548 --> 46:44.218
<i>I don't believe George W. Bush would have
ever been president of the United States</i>

46:44.302 --> 46:46.142
<i>if it wasn't for Roger Stone.</i>

46:48.473 --> 46:50.563
We're back now at
9:40 Eastern Time.

46:50.641 --> 46:53.141
Ross Perot proves to be a
major factor here tonight.

46:53.227 --> 46:54.847
<i>The Bush campaign
headquarters in Houston,</i>

46:54.937 --> 46:58.357
they believe that Ross Perot may
have cost them the presidency.

46:58.441 --> 46:59.531
Thank you.

46:59.609 --> 47:05.569
<i>When George H. W. Bush loses
in 1992, we all know the reason he lost.</i>

47:05.656 --> 47:08.076
<i>It was the Reform
Party and Ross Perot.</i>

47:08.158 --> 47:12.158
<i>The Reform Party was drawing
a disproportionate number of votes</i>

47:12.246 --> 47:13.616
<i>from the Republicans.</i>

47:13.706 --> 47:17.326
Bill Clinton, the great politician,
he never got 50% in any election.

47:17.418 --> 47:19.998
No Ross Perot, no Bill Clinton.

47:20.087 --> 47:23.217
<i>So when the
son is running in 2000,</i>

47:23.298 --> 47:26.088
<i>and the Reform Party
is still on the ballot</i>

47:26.176 --> 47:28.546
<i>in every state in
the United States,</i>

47:28.638 --> 47:30.678
then they're very concerned

47:30.765 --> 47:35.435
about who is going to wind up the
Reform Party candidate for president.

47:36.937 --> 47:40.567
Today, I am ending my lifelong
membership in the Republican Party

47:40.650 --> 47:45.150
and I'm declaring my intention to seek
the nomination of the Reform Party

47:45.237 --> 47:47.987
for the presidency of the
United States of America.

47:49.534 --> 47:52.244
<i>Roger Stone comes
up with the brilliant idea</i>

47:52.327 --> 47:55.247
<i>of getting Pat Buchanan out
of the Republican line</i>

47:55.330 --> 47:57.630
and to get him to run
for the Reform Party.

47:58.209 --> 48:00.749
<i>Yes, I... I
encourage him to run,</i>

48:01.253 --> 48:05.553
but I also, yeah, I have an interest in
the Reform Party imploding at that point.

48:06.133 --> 48:08.933
<i>Just when Buchanan hoped to
have the political stage to himself,</i>

48:09.011 --> 48:10.011
<i>he was trumped.</i>

48:10.095 --> 48:12.215
<i>Businessman Donald Trump
announcing today,</i>

48:12.306 --> 48:15.266
<i>he too will switch from the
GOP to the Reform Party</i>

48:15.350 --> 48:17.690
<i>and may even seek its
presidential nomination.</i>

48:17.770 --> 48:20.610
<i>And if he does, he says, it will
not be just a publicity stunt</i>

48:20.690 --> 48:23.860
<i>for his empire of office
buildings, casinos and hotels.</i>

48:23.943 --> 48:26.993
<i>He will run to win, he says,
despite his reputation.</i>

48:27.071 --> 48:29.071
When Donald Trump announces
that he's going to run,

48:29.156 --> 48:31.116
it completely throws
everything into chaos.

48:31.200 --> 48:35.250
George, should the American people
take the Reform Party seriously?

48:35.329 --> 48:37.459
Well, not if Donald
Trump is their leader.

48:38.165 --> 48:41.535
<i>Donald Trump is being
supported by a fellow named Roger Stone,</i>

48:41.627 --> 48:43.207
<i>who is a longtime
political activist</i>

48:43.295 --> 48:46.045
<i>who had worked for Richard
Nixon and Ronald Reagan.</i>

48:46.131 --> 48:49.301
It looks to me like Pat Buchanan
is going to get in the water,

48:49.384 --> 48:51.684
and a Trump-Buchanan race,
it'd be a great race.

48:51.762 --> 48:54.352
It's unexpected. No
one sees it coming.

48:54.431 --> 48:55.681
And to make matters worse,

48:55.766 --> 48:58.266
<i>Trump doesn't exactly
run for the nomination</i>

48:58.352 --> 49:01.272
<i>so much as he runs
against Pat Buchanan.</i>

49:01.355 --> 49:05.185
He's a Hitler lover. I
guess he's an anti-Semite.

49:05.275 --> 49:07.435
He doesn't like the blacks.
He doesn't like the gays.

49:07.528 --> 49:09.658
What's wrong
with Pat Buchanan?

49:10.405 --> 49:11.945
Well, it's pretty
obvious, isn't it?

49:12.032 --> 49:15.542
He's obviously in love with
Adolf Hitler in some form,

49:15.620 --> 49:18.500
and I don't think the Reform
Party should be taking losers.

49:18.581 --> 49:19.831
Have a good time.

49:19.915 --> 49:24.795
Bear in mind that the arch-strategist
of the Trump campaign is Roger Stone.

49:24.879 --> 49:28.969
Do you think that Roger is up to something
here that deserves closer inspection?

49:29.049 --> 49:30.589
Well, Roger's always
been a little arch.

49:30.676 --> 49:32.636
Uh, I don't know that
he's the arch-strategist.

49:32.720 --> 49:37.020
Do you think that Trump is just a
stalking horse for, say, George Bush?

49:38.392 --> 49:41.942
<i>Stone goes overnight
from backing Buchanan to backing Trump,</i>

49:42.021 --> 49:46.031
<i>it's very hard not to conclude
that Stone had intended all along</i>

49:46.108 --> 49:47.988
<i>to undermine
Buchanan's candidacy</i>

49:48.068 --> 49:51.408
in order to make the Reform
nomination completely untenable,

49:51.488 --> 49:54.238
and thus give Bush a clearer
shot at the presidency.

49:54.324 --> 49:57.204
Political observers this
morning are still wondering

49:57.286 --> 50:01.036
what Donald Trump really wants.
Is he running for president,

50:01.123 --> 50:03.633
or just getting his name
and face on television?

50:04.334 --> 50:08.344
<i>He was in the game enough to
get a tease to the national news media,</i>

50:08.422 --> 50:09.722
<i>and then out of the game.</i>

50:09.799 --> 50:11.719
I'm ashamed of this party!

50:11.801 --> 50:12.891
<i>Political pros say</i>

50:12.968 --> 50:15.048
<i>that to have any impact on the
race for the White House,</i>

50:15.137 --> 50:17.927
<i>the Reform Party will have to
shed its image as a circus.</i>

50:18.015 --> 50:20.515
<i>We will not have
mob rule in this party.</i>

50:20.601 --> 50:22.691
<i>Now, what Roger
freely admitted to me,</i>

50:22.770 --> 50:25.110
<i>is that he had known
since the Nixon days</i>

50:25.189 --> 50:28.109
<i>that Pat Buchanan had
an illegitimate child.</i>

50:28.192 --> 50:31.072
Nominating somebody for the
president of the United States

50:31.153 --> 50:34.823
<i>whose name will appear on the
ballot in all 50 states,</i>

50:34.907 --> 50:38.617
<i>who you are blackmailing at the same
time so that he won't really run.</i>

50:38.703 --> 50:40.753
That's not just a dirty trick.

50:40.830 --> 50:43.250
That's a transformation
of democracy.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.420
<i>The allegation
that I spread the rumor</i>

50:48.503 --> 50:50.843
that Pat Buchanan had
an illegitimate child,

50:50.923 --> 50:52.553
this all comes from
Wayne Barrett.

50:52.633 --> 50:55.183
Wayne Barrett is full of shit.
It's false.

50:55.260 --> 50:58.390
<i>Pat Buchanan got less
than half a percent of the vote.</i>

50:58.472 --> 51:00.472
That was humiliating.

51:00.557 --> 51:03.557
Humiliating for him,
for the Reform Party,

51:03.644 --> 51:09.654
and arguably it put the entire third
party campaign effort back by decades.

51:11.944 --> 51:16.124
After the Reform Party cost the
Republicans the White House in '92,

51:16.198 --> 51:17.868
again in '96...

51:20.620 --> 51:23.960
Yeah, I may have played some
role in derailing them as a party.

51:27.167 --> 51:30.207
Roger Stone knows how
to do the triple bank shot.

51:30.295 --> 51:32.165
The one that nobody else can do.

51:32.256 --> 51:35.046
And it ends up changing
the face of a campaign.

51:35.134 --> 51:37.394
Changing the whole
tenor of a debate.

51:38.012 --> 51:39.682
Shifting the entire paradigm.

51:39.764 --> 51:42.274
People today say that they
like doing dirty tricks.

51:42.349 --> 51:43.929
They're pikers
compared to Roger.

51:44.018 --> 51:46.978
Roger has raised it to
an absolute art form.

51:52.818 --> 51:57.568
Sometimes you confuse me with
the Stephen Colbert character

51:57.657 --> 52:00.657
that I sometimes play
called Roger Stone.

52:00.743 --> 52:03.953
Don't... don't confuse him
with the real Roger Stone.

52:04.747 --> 52:07.917
What's the difference?
- You'll have to sort that out.

52:08.876 --> 52:10.836
<i>Joining me now, Roger Stone,</i>

52:10.920 --> 52:14.550
<i>political consultant and strategist.
And great to see you.</i>

52:14.631 --> 52:17.761
There is a Hillary-Nixon connection
that's very historic and important.

52:17.843 --> 52:22.513
In 1964, Hillary Clinton was fired from
the House Nixon Impeachment Committee

52:22.597 --> 52:24.557
for leaking and lying.

52:24.641 --> 52:27.481
Now, she held this
grudge for 40 years.

52:27.561 --> 52:31.321
Hillary repeatedly blocking Nixon
from meeting with Clinton.

52:31.398 --> 52:33.528
Finally, Clinton overrules her.

52:33.608 --> 52:35.858
Nixon and Clinton meet,
and they hit it off.

52:35.945 --> 52:37.315
And Nixon met Hillary.

52:37.404 --> 52:38.954
I said, "Mr. President,
what did you think?"

52:39.031 --> 52:41.871
He said, "She's cold.
Cold as ice."

52:43.160 --> 52:44.450
<i>You're doing
a documentary?</i>

52:44.536 --> 52:46.286
Yes, this gentleman's
doing a documentary.

52:46.371 --> 52:49.541
He's one of those dangerous
liberal, pinko, left-wing...

52:49.624 --> 52:50.924
I hate people like you.

52:51.001 --> 52:53.671
...homosexual, <i>New York Times</i>
commies, but he's not a bad guy.

52:53.754 --> 52:55.134
I know who they are.

52:55.214 --> 52:58.804
Part of the reason we've always
paid attention to Roger,

52:58.884 --> 53:01.264
<i>is he just looks different
from everyone else.</i>

53:01.345 --> 53:04.885
<i>You know, here we have
a bodybuilding dandy.</i>

53:04.974 --> 53:07.394
A category, as far as
I'm concerned, of one.

53:08.560 --> 53:14.730
Ladies and gentlemen, the
Prince of Darkness, Roger J. Stone.

53:14.817 --> 53:18.237
I am no longer a Republican.
I joined the Libertarian Party.

53:18.320 --> 53:23.280
<i>I do think he is really alienated
from the contemporary Republican Party.</i>

53:23.367 --> 53:27.657
<i>He is, I think, spiritually, and
now politically, a libertarian.</i>

53:27.747 --> 53:29.997
From the time that I was
a Young Republican,

53:30.082 --> 53:31.882
I always had a
libertarian streak.

53:31.959 --> 53:37.209
I have always been pro-choice,
pro-gay marriage, pro-marijuana.

53:37.631 --> 53:39.051
<i>As a Libertarian-Republican,</i>

53:39.133 --> 53:41.553
<i>I've always believed in
gay marriage equality.</i>

53:41.635 --> 53:47.215
It's a civil right that equal access
is guaranteed by the Constitution.

53:47.307 --> 53:50.517
<i>So, uh, I'm going to the
Gay Pride parade today.</i>

53:55.900 --> 53:58.780
Let's welcome the
Log Cabin Republicans!

54:02.447 --> 54:06.697
The Log Cabin Republicans is the nation's
only organization of Republicans

54:06.786 --> 54:12.246
who support fairness, freedom and
equality for gay and lesbian Americans.

54:17.838 --> 54:20.758
He may have, as a
result of his personal life,

54:21.466 --> 54:24.846
some authentic beliefs
at the age of 60 or 61.

54:24.929 --> 54:29.559
I think he's internalized some
of the gay rights agenda.

54:29.641 --> 54:33.731
I think he's internalized
some of the pro-drug agenda.

54:35.647 --> 54:39.397
<i>After the scandal
devours him in 1996...</i>

54:39.484 --> 54:41.034
<i>Since he's been rejected</i>

54:41.111 --> 54:45.031
<i>and essentially thrown out of
mainstream Republican politics,</i>

54:45.115 --> 54:50.955
<i>he doesn't really have any choice but
to figure out some third-party avenue.</i>

54:51.038 --> 54:55.498
<i>And so he's looking for
a reprise of 2000.</i>

54:55.584 --> 55:00.344
He's looking to see if he can find
an angle where he can matter.

55:04.051 --> 55:08.101
I've stayed away from Roger,
personally, because he's so charming,

55:08.180 --> 55:10.520
and you can see the ways in
which he distorts the reporters

55:10.599 --> 55:11.889
who are around that charm.

55:11.976 --> 55:15.646
At the same time, there's no way
to avoid writing about him,

55:15.729 --> 55:19.729
<i>since he's been everywhere dark and ugly
in our politics for many, many years.</i>

55:20.234 --> 55:23.244
<i>In 2004, he's blamed for
forging the documents</i>

55:23.320 --> 55:27.200
<i>that destroyed Dan Rather's career and
also helped re-elect President Bush.</i>

55:27.282 --> 55:28.372
<i>Roger Stone,</i>

55:28.450 --> 55:30.330
<i>an old dirty trickster
from the Nixon days,</i>

55:30.410 --> 55:32.960
<i>may have been involved in the
production of these documents.</i>

55:33.038 --> 55:35.368
Look, politics is a
rough-and-tumble business,

55:35.457 --> 55:36.827
but this is just a cheap shot.

55:38.085 --> 55:41.375
<i>That same year, Stone consulted
for Al Sharpton's presidential run</i>

55:41.463 --> 55:44.223
<i>that helped disrupt the
Democratic primary process.</i>

55:44.299 --> 55:48.259
What Stone is in this for, is to use
Sharpton as a disruptive force.

55:48.345 --> 55:51.675
Some out there who follow
presidential politics

55:51.765 --> 55:53.515
ascribe to you magical powers,

55:53.600 --> 55:56.230
consider you the puppet master
of the Sharpton campaign.

55:56.311 --> 55:58.521
Look, Roger's always
been an outlaw

55:58.605 --> 56:02.935
and drawn to like-minded outlaws,
like Sharpton, like Trump.

56:03.027 --> 56:06.107
I don't think that's changed at all.
What's changed is the country.

56:06.696 --> 56:09.816
<i>A few years later, he took
credit for bringing down his nemesis,</i>

56:09.909 --> 56:11.619
<i>New York governor Eliot Spitzer.</i>

56:11.701 --> 56:15.081
I am deeply sorry that I did not
live up to what was expected of me.

56:15.164 --> 56:17.424
I am resigning from the
office of governor.

56:17.499 --> 56:21.589
<i>He says he got a tip
from a hooker in a sex club.</i>

56:21.962 --> 56:24.552
You had heard that the governor
liked to wear his socks

56:24.631 --> 56:26.631
when he engaged in
sexual activities?

56:26.716 --> 56:30.046
I ask you, Dominic, what kind of
guy does it with his socks on?

56:30.137 --> 56:31.757
Sounds like Eliot Spitzer to me.

56:31.846 --> 56:35.096
<i>Roger understands
the dark heart of the media</i>

56:35.184 --> 56:38.524
even better than we understand
ourselves sometimes.

56:38.604 --> 56:41.324
<i>Because if he tells us</i>

56:41.398 --> 56:44.478
<i>that Eliot Spitzer was wearing
black socks when he had sex,</i>

56:44.568 --> 56:47.358
he knew that that would
be irresistible,

56:47.446 --> 56:51.326
even if it had absolutely nothing
to do with the truth at all.

56:51.825 --> 56:53.285
<i>What do you say
to people who say,</i>

56:53.368 --> 56:57.498
"It's awfully convenient that you
happened to meet a prostitute

56:57.581 --> 57:01.211
who was involved with Eliot Spitzer,
given your animus toward Eliot Spitzer"?

57:01.293 --> 57:03.463
Uh, there are
skeptics everywhere.

57:04.879 --> 57:07.129
Stone's so desperate to
stay in the public eye,

57:07.216 --> 57:09.336
that he peddles garbage
conspiracy theories.

57:09.426 --> 57:12.176
<i>Like the supposed tape of
Michelle Obama saying "whitey."</i>

57:12.262 --> 57:15.472
Roger, you can't just say that
and say you have no proof for it

57:15.557 --> 57:16.927
and make a comment like that.

57:17.017 --> 57:18.727
No, no, no. Let me finish.

57:18.810 --> 57:21.270
<i>And worse, the now
infamous "birther" lie</i>

57:21.355 --> 57:23.975
<i>that President Barack
Obama is a secret Muslim</i>

57:24.066 --> 57:26.856
<i>and a Manchurian president who
wasn't really born in America.</i>

57:26.944 --> 57:29.954
<i>Donald Trump's one of the
last people that was still touting that,</i>

57:30.030 --> 57:32.910
because Roger Stone and he
were conspiring one day

57:32.992 --> 57:35.542
and Roger giggled and rubbed
his hands together and said,

57:35.619 --> 57:38.079
"I can get the real birth
certificate from Kenya."

57:38.163 --> 57:39.913
And Trump, you know,
went and believed it.

57:39.999 --> 57:42.629
If he wasn't born
in this country,

57:42.709 --> 57:44.789
it's one of the great
scams of all time. - Absolutely.

57:44.878 --> 57:47.128
But I don't think that's the case.
- Well, you don't...

57:47.756 --> 57:50.006
There's something on that birth
certificate that he doesn't like.

57:50.092 --> 57:51.092
Oh, my God!

57:51.176 --> 57:53.636
That's a terrible thing to say!

57:53.720 --> 57:57.850
Have you ever heard of any white president
asked to be shown their birth certificate?

57:57.933 --> 58:01.353
When you become a president of
the United States of America,

58:01.436 --> 58:03.556
you know that he is American.

58:03.647 --> 58:05.437
I'm sorry, that's BS.

58:05.524 --> 58:10.204
Why is Donald Trump so happy to throw
himself into the "birther" pool?

58:10.279 --> 58:14.529
Longtime Trump casino lobbyist and GOP
advisor Roger Stone told <i>Politico</i>

58:14.616 --> 58:18.866
<i>"Personally, I think it is brilliant.
It's base building.</i>

58:18.953 --> 58:23.383
<i>It gives voice to a concern
shared by many on the right."</i>

58:23.458 --> 58:26.498
Is there such a thing as coded
appeals to racist sentiment?

58:26.586 --> 58:29.666
There is such a thing.
- Of course, but I see none here.

58:29.756 --> 58:30.916
Okay, as far as
you're concerned.

58:31.008 --> 58:33.008
The whole "birther" movement,

58:33.093 --> 58:38.433
which was so crazy and
so wrong and so racist,

58:38.515 --> 58:42.805
that is the basis of
Trump's political appeal.

58:50.610 --> 58:52.530
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

58:53.113 --> 58:55.203
I am officially running...

58:57.534 --> 59:00.414
...for president of
the United States,

59:00.495 --> 59:05.165
<i>and we are going to make
our country great again.</i>

59:05.250 --> 59:07.250
What's your precise
role with Donald Trump?

59:07.335 --> 59:08.995
Are you a paid advisor?
- Uh... I am now.

59:09.088 --> 59:13.588
I'm just helping as a general
communications strategist, I guess.

59:13.675 --> 59:16.465
People get the impression that this
is performance art for Donald Trump.

59:16.553 --> 59:19.513
Is he serious about being
president of the United States?

59:19.598 --> 59:24.098
I will build a great, great
wall on our southern border,

59:24.186 --> 59:27.016
and I will have Mexico
pay for that wall.

59:27.106 --> 59:28.106
Yes!
- Mark my words.

59:28.190 --> 59:29.360
Is this a president talking?

59:29.441 --> 59:30.691
If there is one murder,

59:30.775 --> 59:34.605
if there is one crime by someone who
is not supposed to be in the country,

59:34.696 --> 59:35.986
that's one crime too many.

59:36.073 --> 59:40.583
I think Trump has identified a
legitimate hot-button issue.

59:40.660 --> 59:44.830
"Donald J. Trump is calling for
a total and complete shutdown

59:44.914 --> 59:47.884
of Muslims entering
the United States

59:47.959 --> 59:54.879
until our country's representatives can
figure out what the hell is going on."

59:56.676 --> 59:58.676
<i>Roger Stone came
to power with Nixon.</i>

59:58.762 --> 01:00:01.142
And Nixon, of course, had
the Southern strategy,

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:04.853
<i>which was all about milking
people's racial resentments,</i>

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:07.564
<i>and in the case of Trump,
anti-immigrant resentments.</i>

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:11.226
Working up hate that would turn
them against the government

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:14.186
and against the so-called
elites who were in government.

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:17.198
The political system
is a cesspool.

01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:18.241
<i>I've been a lobbyist.</i>

01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:21.033
<i>I worked on the Senate side.
I worked on the House side.</i>

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:22.658
<i>I saw how the sausage are made.</i>

01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:24.834
<i>The whole process
is deeply corrupt.</i>

01:00:25.705 --> 01:00:27.615
<i>Trump is the only one
who can clean it up.</i>

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:29.537
<i>Trump!
Trump! Trump!</i>

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:33.166
Trump! Trump! Trump!

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:37.585
We are going to Washington, DC,

01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:40.926
and we are going to do what?

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:43.722
Drain the swamp.

01:00:45.267 --> 01:00:46.767
It is so corrupt.

01:00:46.851 --> 01:00:50.651
The best part is that he's just kicking
the political establishment in the balls.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:54.980
They are shitting a brick, because
he's challenging the status quo.

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:57.698
All these other candidates are
really for the status quo.

01:00:57.779 --> 01:01:03.159
Roger's the ultimate insider, which
makes him incredibly good at seeing

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:06.543
how to package someone he
could sell as an outsider.

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:10.121
We are going to stand up
for the American worker

01:01:10.209 --> 01:01:14.589
like nobody has ever stood
up for that worker before.

01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:19.054
There is real upset over
jobs, over globalization,

01:01:19.133 --> 01:01:23.643
<i>over people losing their sort
of status and their incomes.</i>

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:26.772
You know, there are all kinds
of answers to these questions,

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.770
but the answers that he's
provided, for the most part,

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:32.563
are the answers that
billionaires are interested in.

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:37.937
We're also going to eliminate
job-killing regulations.

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:43.782
And lift the restrictions on the
production of American energy,

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:50.287
including shale, oil, natural
gas and beautiful, clean coal.

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:53.214
There's no grassroots movement

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:57.513
to gut the EPA and give people
dirty water and dirty air.

01:01:57.589 --> 01:02:01.929
The only people who are really caring
about that are the polluting industries.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.890
They say I have the most loyal people.
Did you ever see that?

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:06.771
Where I could stand in the
middle of Fifth Avenue

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:09.598
and shoot somebody, and I
wouldn't lose any voters, okay?

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:11.354
It's, like, incredible.

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:14.606
Roger understands that I've
always gotten great ratings,

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:18.359
whether it's on <i>The Apprentice</i>
or virtually any interview,

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:19.993
and that's why people
want to interview me.

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:23.029
And I think that's one of the things
that's always fascinated Roger,

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:26.414
because, ultimately, it
is all about the ratings

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:29.083
and it is all about people
watching and the eyeballs.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:33.212
Mr. Trump, you've called women
you don't like "fat pigs,"

01:02:33.292 --> 01:02:37.502
"dogs," "slobs," and
"disgusting animals."

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:40.207
Your Twitter account...
- Only Rosie O'Donnell.

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:44.298
Unlike every other candidate
I have ever worked with,

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:48.136
he is unscripted, he is
unrehearsed, he is unhandled.

01:02:48.222 --> 01:02:51.732
Contrast that with Jeb Bush, who
looks both bored and annoyed,

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:56.150
like, "Just... This is mine. Just
anoint me and give it to me.

01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:59.070
Father, Father, tell them
it's my turn to be king."

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:00.610
Roger,
before you go,

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:03.784
uh, will you remain with the Donald
now throughout the campaign?

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:06.163
I'll do whatever the
Donald asks me to do.

01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:08.992
<i>Good evening.
It's been 48 hours</i>

01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:11.157
since the first Republican
presidential debate,

01:03:11.245 --> 01:03:14.785
and a testy exchange between Donald
Trump and moderator Megyn Kelly

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:16.634
has become a flash
point in the campaign.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:20.000
<i>You know, you could see there
was blood coming out of her eyes, uh,</i>

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:22.668
<i>blood coming out
of her wherever.</i>

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:26.177
Now members of the Republican field
are lining up to criticize him.

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:29.680
And word this evening that an advisor
and a longtime friend of Trump's

01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:31.484
has resigned from the campaign.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.388
Trump says he fired him.

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:34.807
<i>Roger
Stone's a nice guy,</i>

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:37.774
<i>but I let him go because I
really wasn't using him,</i>

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:41.736
<i>and he liked to get a lot of publicity
for himself, which I didn't want.</i>

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:44.068
He's real, he's genuine,
and it's entertaining.

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:45.663
That's why he's doing so well.

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:49.783
So why'd he fire you?
- He didn't. I quit.

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:52.198
"Oh, you can't fire me.
I quit!"

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:56.957
<i>Did he get fired or
did he quit? I don't know.</i>

01:03:57.041 --> 01:03:59.001
He still hasn't admitted
to me that he got fired,

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:00.955
and I've tried numerous times.

01:04:01.045 --> 01:04:02.545
"Bullshit, you got fired.
Come on."

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:03.631
"No, no, no!"

01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:06.585
Because Roger, you know, Roger the
feminist, was really offended

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:09.296
about what Trump said
about Megyn Kelly.

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:11.929
<i>I don't need
the Trump campaign</i>

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:14.055
<i>to generate press
coverage for myself,</i>

01:04:14.142 --> 01:04:17.062
<i>and I can get in the
tabloids any time I want.</i>

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:19.855
But to say that you want me
to work on your campaign,

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:21.939
but you don't want me
to talk to reporters

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:23.775
would be like saying to me,

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.570
"I just don't want you to breathe
air between now and November.

01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:28.945
If you could just agree
not to breathe any air

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:31.242
or eat any food,
everything will be fine."

01:04:31.325 --> 01:04:35.115
Talking to reporters is what I do.
That's my value.

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:37.874
Roger Stone and I don't agree on anything.
I don't...

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.747
He does not represent the
Trump campaign. - Not what he says.

01:04:40.835 --> 01:04:42.665
What Roger Stone says
and what the truth are

01:04:42.754 --> 01:04:44.554
are two factually very
different things.

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:47.551
<i>There's no question
Lewandowski worked behind the scenes</i>

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:49.554
<i>to get Roger thrown
out of the campaign.</i>

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:52.006
He is an expert at stabbing
people in the back.

01:04:52.096 --> 01:04:55.266
That guy's got an incredible
capacity for treachery.

01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:58.559
By the way, I spoke to a Polish
language expert the other day.

01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:02.855
I was unaware of the fact that
Lewandowski, loosely translated,

01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:04.321
means "cocksucker."

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:09.744
Well, Roger is a tough guy, and
Roger will make enemies sometimes

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:12.413
that I always say, there's
no reason for it.

01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:14.204
<i>Roger is older now,</i>

01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:18.995
<i>and I think he sees
the Trump campaign,</i>

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:22.422
at once as his creation,

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:28.682
but also something that he's not
allowed to participate in day to day.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:32.508
And that, understandably,
makes him sad.

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:34.386
<i>I have no
interest in going back.</i>

01:05:34.473 --> 01:05:37.893
<i>Although I strongly support Trump,
we have managerial differences.</i>

01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:41.556
And, meanwhile, I'm just making the very
best case for him in public that I can,

01:05:41.646 --> 01:05:44.396
'cause I do think he
has what it takes.

01:05:44.483 --> 01:05:48.193
There's always this tension between
the candidate and his consultant.

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:52.157
The candidate resents the credit
the consultant gets for his words.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.790
<i>The consultant resents, you know, the
fame and fortune the candidate gets</i>

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.329
<i>when he did all the work.</i>

01:05:57.411 --> 01:06:00.461
<i>And Trump hated the fact that Stone
was showing up on cable news</i>

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.130
<i>and that people were, you know,
calling him Trump's brain.</i>

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:04.209
<i>So he fired him.</i>

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:06.253
But it doesn't mean he
stopped relying on him.

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:08.467
It seems to me there is more
than meets the eye here

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:11.088
with Roger Stone parting company
from the Trump campaign,

01:06:11.175 --> 01:06:14.635
coming on my program and others
and giving the big Trump pitch.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:17.311
You media types
are so conspiratorial.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:20.730
No. No, the Stone-Trump types, I
think, are the conspiratorial.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:21.940
Unlike...

01:06:24.523 --> 01:06:29.073
Only two campaigns have a
plausible path to the nomination.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:31.362
Ours and Donald Trump's.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:36.791
Nobody else has any mathematical
possibility, whatsoever.

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:41.288
L-Y-I-N-apostrophe, lyin' Ted!

01:06:41.372 --> 01:06:45.292
The Bible held high, he puts
it down and then he lies.

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:49.376
Most of the time, I win
the evangelical vote.

01:06:49.463 --> 01:06:53.763
The evangelicals, the
Christians, like Donald Trump.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:55.263
I'm a straight shooter.

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:58.524
<i>After a crushing
13-point defeat in Wisconsin,</i>

01:06:58.598 --> 01:06:59.808
<i>Trump turned a page,</i>

01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:02.731
<i>sidelining campaign manager
Corey Lewandowski.</i>

01:07:02.811 --> 01:07:05.151
<i>He wasn't as effective
for the last couple of months.</i>

01:07:05.229 --> 01:07:07.769
<i>News breaking that the
GOP front-runner, by the way,</i>

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:12.197
<i>has hired Paul Manafort to lead his
campaign's convention efforts.</i>

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:16.698
Paul Manafort, former partner of
mine, the single best vote counter

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:19.953
and convention strategist
in the Republican Party.

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:23.326
When Paul Manafort got publicly
named, I got a phone call that day.

01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:25.424
And it was Roger on the
other end of the line.

01:07:25.499 --> 01:07:28.879
And you know what he sang?
"Back in the Saddle Again."

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:30.842
I mean, Roger knows
what Roger's doing.

01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:33.470
<i>Trump asked
me to get involved</i>

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.430
<i>because my reputation, among
other things in politics,</i>

01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:39.850
is understanding of the convention
process, the delegate process.

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:42.731
And most of the major
successful big conventions

01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:45.809
over the last 30 years, I've
been intimately involved in.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.765
Did Roger recommend
you for the job?

01:07:47.856 --> 01:07:51.026
Roger was one of the two or three people
who strongly recommended me, yes.

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:55.609
Even after Roger stopped being the
principal political advisor to Trump,

01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:57.657
he continued to be a
very important advisor,

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:58.660
and is to this day.

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.791
<i>I want to start with Roger Stone,</i>

01:08:03.872 --> 01:08:07.252
<i>because you just launched
a pro-Trump super PAC.</i>

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:09.753
I thought, A, Donald Trump
didn't like super PACs,

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:12.046
B, I thought you quit
or he fired you.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:15.720
I'm not still sure what happened there. So
what the heck is this all about, Roger?

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:19.550
Roger told me when I was
very young, "Caputo," he says,

01:08:19.638 --> 01:08:21.178
"The media is two things.

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:24.814
They're either evil or
they're lazy, or they're both.

01:08:24.893 --> 01:08:27.693
And if you understand that,
you can do whatever you want."

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:37.281
Yeah, I live a pretty
Machiavellian life, and I'm a skeptic.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:41.703
I tend to believe the worst of people
because I understand human nature.

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:44.245
Human nature has never changed.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:46.497
That's why one of Stone's
Rules is that hate

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.710
is a stronger
motivator than love.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:50.332
That's because it is.

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:52.917
<i>The</i> National
Enquirer <i>published a story.</i>

01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:57.634
It is a story that quoted one
source on the record, Roger Stone.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:01.136
<i>Let me be clear. This</i> National
Enquirer <i>story is garbage.</i>

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:04.770
And it is a smear that has come
from Donald Trump and his henchmen.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:08.939
<i>One of the keys to defeating an
opponent is getting inside their head.</i>

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.569
He incorrectly claims that I
am the source of this story

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:16.488
regarding allegations that
he has been adulterous.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:18.819
<i>And I would note that Mr.
Stone is a man</i>

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:21.694
who has 50 years of dirty
tricks behind him.

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:25.703
He's a man for whom a
term was coined...

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:28.786
for copulating with a rodent.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:32.002
I, of course, am quoted in
this story, on the record,

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:36.205
saying that it would hurt him badly
with his evangelical followers.

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:40.886
He has, as you know,
attacked me on CNN...

01:09:40.969 --> 01:09:44.389
Roger Stone has been Donald
Trump's chief political advisor.

01:09:44.471 --> 01:09:47.392
He planned and ran his
presidential campaign.

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:49.595
...attacked me on Megyn Kelly.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:54.976
His entire business has been dirty tricks,
has been lies, has been personal smears.

01:09:55.066 --> 01:09:58.896
These attacks on me by him
and by his surrogates,

01:09:58.987 --> 01:10:00.857
I find this most satisfying.

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:05.447
I hope he's laying awake at night,
worrying about what I'm going to do next.

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:08.245
<i>He's a little bit
like the Joker in</i> Batman.

01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:10.659
<i>I mean, he gets a kick
out of doing this.</i>

01:10:10.749 --> 01:10:16.209
To some extent, his pleasure
at burning down the house

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:18.255
is infectious for people.

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:21.799
<i>And as a reporter, you call him up
because you want the outrageous quote.</i>

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:24.545
You want, you know... You want
to hear what he's gonna say.

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:27.177
He's also very plugged-in.
He's in the know.

01:10:27.265 --> 01:10:28.725
He talks to a million people.

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:32.308
<i>I just got a call from this
reporter who was calling to warn me</i>

01:10:32.395 --> 01:10:35.685
<i>that Corey is now openly telling
people he's got the goods on Manafort.</i>

01:10:35.774 --> 01:10:39.694
He is telling reporters that
he has something on Manafort

01:10:39.778 --> 01:10:42.738
that will blow him
out of the campaign.

01:10:42.822 --> 01:10:44.822
Yeah, we gotta take
the little prick out.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.290
<i>I've been backgrounding reporters on
what a total fucking disaster he's been.</i>

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:55.461
<i>And there's a story that just
went up by Mike Isikoff at Yahoo</i>

01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:59.883
<i>that dips into the whole
Pakistani blah, blah, blah.</i>

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:04.144
If you look at Manafort's
long history of lobbying,

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:07.808
it is about as controversial
as you can get.

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:12.187
You are as connected
to the insider game

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:14.648
of, what you've even
said on record yourself,

01:11:14.728 --> 01:11:17.068
"influence peddling,"
as anybody.

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:19.688
How can you be the antidote
or anything to help Trump

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:21.526
when you seem to go
against his main message?

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:22.650
It depends on who you talk to

01:11:22.736 --> 01:11:25.276
if I'm part of the establishment
or part of the antiestablishment.

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:27.124
You better get rid
of the super PACs

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.620
because they're causing a big
problem with this country.

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:33.333
...and a lot of bad decisions
that are being made

01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:36.134
for the benefit of lobbyists
and special interests.

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:38.249
Donald Trump tells America
the system is rigged

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:40.166
by the lobbyists and
the super PAC money,

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:42.304
and who does he turn
to as his top guys?

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:46.141
Roger Stone and Paul Manafort, who
literally put up that rigging.

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:49.559
It's a crooked system, it's
a system that's rigged,

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:53.308
and we're going to go back to the old way.
It's called "You Vote and You Win."

01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:56.102
Thank you very much, everybody.
Thank you.

01:11:56.187 --> 01:12:00.067
Donald Trump is riding
a crest of voter anger

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:02.529
over 30 years of
failed policies.

01:12:03.111 --> 01:12:07.201
<i>Voter anger explains the
entire rise of Trump.</i>

01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:08.571
<i>I love the old days.</i>

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:12.037
<i>You know what they used to do to guys like
that when they were in a place like this?</i>

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.410
They'd be carried out
on a stretcher, folks.

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:19.837
Go fucking make my tortilla, motherfucker,
and build that fucking wall for me!

01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:21.461
Trump!

01:12:21.545 --> 01:12:24.625
Trump!
Trump! Trump!

01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:28.135
Roger Stone, he's very
smart about anger.

01:12:28.219 --> 01:12:30.719
It's one of the things
he understands best.

01:12:30.804 --> 01:12:36.314
It's angry, white working-class voters
whose resentments are being milked

01:12:36.394 --> 01:12:41.074
to push an agenda that's useful to some
of the richest people in the country.

01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:47.279
These are hardly people who are in
tune with the little guy's interests.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:51.663
Um, but they understand how to
manipulate the little guy's interests.

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:53.742
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
- Yes, I can.

01:12:53.828 --> 01:12:55.538
Can you hear me?
<i>- You're awesome.</i>

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.871
<i>Easy on the rape stuff.
Let's not...</i>

01:12:57.957 --> 01:12:59.497
I'll do the best I can, but...

01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:03.094
<i>I know, I know. Let's just, like...</i>
- Facts are facts, you know?

01:13:03.171 --> 01:13:05.841
Do you believe it's too early for
Trump to be bringing up Bill Clinton?

01:13:05.924 --> 01:13:08.474
Should Trump save all of this

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:12.011
and wait until he's the nominee
and he's running against her in the general?

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:13.096
No, I don't agree.

01:13:13.181 --> 01:13:16.101
I don't think he had any choice,
'cause he didn't bring this up.

01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:20.064
Hillary Clinton brought it up when she
attempted to play the victim card.

01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:21.856
Does he know everything
that's in your book?

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.900
Are you giving him
information at all?

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.573
Well, as you know, and
it's been well documented,

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:29.822
she went after the women very,
very strongly and very viciously,

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:32.236
according to the women and
according to other sources.

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:34.695
<i>Uh, a major book's
been written about it.</i>

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:37.745
<i>And it's a book that's a
very well-respected book.</i>

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:42.207
<i>If you read Roger's blog,</i> The
Stone Zone, <i>or follow him on Twitter,</i>

01:13:42.293 --> 01:13:43.423
it's like coming attractions

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:46.012
for the attacks Donald Trump will
be launching two weeks later.

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:49.929
It is Hillary who hires the
heavy-handed private detectives

01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:53.049
who break into these women's
homes and ransack them,

01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:56.427
who threaten their children,
who kill their pets.

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:59.436
<i>She's married to a man</i>

01:13:59.518 --> 01:14:02.308
who was the worst abuser of women
in the history of politics.

01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:06.646
And Hillary was an enabler, and
she treated these women horribly.

01:14:06.734 --> 01:14:11.744
Roger's, you know, relationship with
Trump has been so interconnected

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:14.622
that it's hard to define what's
Roger and what's Donald.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.370
While it'll be clearly
a Trump presidency,

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:20.163
I think it's influenced
by a Stone philosophy.

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.250
Shake-up at the Trump campaign

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:25.294
as the campaign manager,
Corey Lewandowski,

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:27.418
has now parted ways
with the campaign.

01:14:27.505 --> 01:14:30.875
<i>Paul Manafort taking
the reins of the Trump campaign.</i>

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:32.217
<i>Well, let's see.</i>

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.301
Is it a surprise
that Paul Manafort

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:36.597
wound up as the
campaign chairman for Trump?

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.310
No, of course not. That
was engineered by Roger

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:42.442
<i>as a way to get Corey Lewandowski
bounced out of the campaign.</i>

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.110
<i>It took a couple months,
but they did it.</i>

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:46.318
Roger has had a guiding
hand in all of this.

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:48.149
Now, Trump is hard to guide.

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:49.864
He spits the bit out.

01:14:49.943 --> 01:14:52.073
You know, he doesn't want
to be driven at all.

01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:55.655
But Roger's had as much influence
on the campaign as anyone.

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:57.661
I think the campaign's
being professionalized.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:59.953
Manafort's doing a
phenomenal job.

01:15:00.038 --> 01:15:02.788
I think he instills
confidence in the campaign

01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:04.423
that they didn't have before.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.840
Did you give any reporters
background on Lewandowski?

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.170
No.

01:15:09.255 --> 01:15:11.755
Just stay silent!

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.340
Just stay silent!
Just stay silent!

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:17.308
Just stay silent!

01:15:17.388 --> 01:15:18.718
<i>Just stay silent!</i>

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.601
How often
do you talk to him?

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:25.306
Uh, from time to time.

01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:27.646
Are you an informal advisor?
Would you call yourself that?

01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:29.651
I'm just an FOT,
Friend of Trump.

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:33.856
We need, in our
country, law and order.

01:15:34.572 --> 01:15:38.122
And if I'm elected
president, that will happen.

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:48.125
<i>How real is the Dump Trump
movement inside the Republican Party?</i>

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:50.921
It's real because you've
got, now, an attitude

01:15:51.004 --> 01:15:53.514
within the Republican Party,
at the highest levels,

01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:55.261
that this would be
better for the party.

01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:57.643
<i>Discussions
about cutting Trump loose</i>

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.930
<i>are focused on the
Republican Convention.</i>

01:16:00.013 --> 01:16:04.353
<i>Finding a way to free delegates for
Trump to vote for someone else.</i>

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:07.685
<i>I could see Donald Trump
going to the convention in Cleveland</i>

01:16:07.771 --> 01:16:09.731
and having the nomination
stolen from him.

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:14.235
So, I have set up a convention
operation to try to ensure

01:16:14.695 --> 01:16:18.065
<i>that the Republican nomination
is not stolen from Donald Trump.</i>

01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:21.287
<i>I'm representing a tremendous
many, many millions of people.</i>

01:16:21.369 --> 01:16:23.949
<i>I think you would have problems
like you've never seen before.</i>

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:26.748
<i>I think bad things would happen.
I think you'd have riots.</i>

01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:31.592
I have warned the public of what
I believe is "the big steal."

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:33.590
<i>We're going to have protests.</i>

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:37.802
We will disclose the hotels
and the room numbers

01:16:37.885 --> 01:16:41.345
of those delegates who are
directly involved in the steal.

01:16:41.972 --> 01:16:46.692
<i>What about the issue of Donald
Trump's hit man, Roger Stone,</i>

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:49.269
threatening violence
in Cleveland?

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:51.935
Appropriate rhetoric? - I'm
not giving him my hotel room.

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:54.654
Okay, so do you sort of...

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:57.065
Roger is not an official
part of the campaign.

01:16:57.155 --> 01:16:59.815
Did he bring you in? Okay.
- No. In fact, not at all.

01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:03.987
Roger Stone threatened yesterday that
he will send Donald Trump supporters

01:17:04.077 --> 01:17:06.997
to the hotel rooms of
any Republican delegate

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:10.000
who tries stealing the nomination
from Trump this summer.

01:17:10.083 --> 01:17:12.673
And those delegates will
probably answer the door, too,

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:15.013
because they're
expecting a prostitute.

01:17:15.088 --> 01:17:17.048
"Hey!"

01:17:27.935 --> 01:17:29.975
Caputo.
- How are you, man?

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:31.272
I'm good.
- What's going on?

01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:33.895
Thank you. One more photo?
- All right. Give 'em hell.

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:34.982
Mr. Stone.

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:36.987
How are you? - Thank you
for your years of service.

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:39.569
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it. That's very kind.

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.105
Make America great again.

01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:50.037
I'm very sorry, but I am
not gonna do this again.

01:17:50.123 --> 01:17:53.753
<i>Delegates were denied an
opportunity to vote on the rules.</i>

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:57.876
<i>Some saw it as their last chance
to take the nomination from Trump.</i>

01:17:57.965 --> 01:18:01.675
We want Trump!
We want Trump!

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.640
Trump is able to take
over the Republican Party

01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:07.311
because the Republican Party is a
bit like the Reform Party in 2000.

01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:08.931
<i>It's become a shell.</i>

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:11.807
<i>When it's something which is so
out of touch with its own voters,</i>

01:18:11.895 --> 01:18:16.065
<i>someone who steps in and
communicates through social media</i>

01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:19.199
<i>straight into television,
with tremendous charisma,</i>

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:21.448
<i>is able to steal the party.</i>

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:23.527
One half of the Trump story

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:29.076
is the story about how one man's ego led
him to take over the Republican Party.

01:18:29.162 --> 01:18:33.252
The other half of the story is how
the Republicans became so hollow

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:35.004
that someone could
do that to them.

01:18:35.085 --> 01:18:38.915
The Trump campaign is the apotheosis
of Roger Stone's politics.

01:18:39.006 --> 01:18:40.626
America!

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:44.796
<i>It's the part of the
Republican Party that he represents:</i>

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:48.597
<i>toughness, anger, not being
politically correct.</i>

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:50.982
If you look at the crime
rate in places like Chicago,

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:52.479
it's out of control, yes.

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:56.321
Trump is the law and order candidate.
He does speak to the silent majority.

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:58.689
I'm here with Roger
Stone, the one and only.

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:01.896
Kind of a legend in political
consulting, and, I think fair to say,

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:04.777
one of the, if not the, architect
of the Trump movement.

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:06.155
You've had an
interesting career,

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:09.662
because you were in the kind of
establishment political world

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.035
and you had a great
career there.

01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:14.921
Then you kind of went off into
your Stone world for a while.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.040
And now you're back.
Now you're a big deal.

01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:18.457
We're now in the age of Stone.

01:19:18.546 --> 01:19:20.876
I mean, I feel like it's
come all the way around,

01:19:20.964 --> 01:19:23.224
back to the days when you
and I and Terry Dolan

01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:25.431
were plotting a takedown
of the establishment.

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:29.391
Then we became the establishment.
Then we became antiestablishment.

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:31.523
Roger is a lot more than
a dirty tricks artist.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.400
He kind of grabs that persona.
It's like his pro wrestling name.

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:37.148
<i>But in the real world of politics,
he's a real strategist.</i>

01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:40.730
<i>And I think whenever he kind of creates
the dirty trickster thing for the media,</i>

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:42.698
he's having fun, but he's
slumming a little bit.

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:46.198
You're a rape denier!
You're a rape denier!

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:48.662
America may be collapsing
and breaking apart,

01:19:48.742 --> 01:19:51.242
<i>but Roger Stone is
determined to enjoy it.</i>

01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:55.415
This for you, right here. It's "rape."
It's Bill Clinton. It says "rape."

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:57.629
Okay, you know who does
this kind of shirt?

01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:58.750
First of all, a sick guy.

01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:00.166
Get him, Stone! Come on!

01:20:00.253 --> 01:20:03.383
You know who's accused in court
papers of being a rapist?

01:20:03.466 --> 01:20:05.256
Donald J. Trump!
- By Jane Doe.

01:20:05.343 --> 01:20:06.393
By Jane and Tiffany Doe.

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:09.009
Jane Doe. Who's Jane Doe?
- It's in court papers.

01:20:09.096 --> 01:20:12.266
You're a sick man, Roger Stone.
- No. You're a liar. Stone-cold liar.

01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:13.930
You're the biggest liar.
- No.

01:20:14.017 --> 01:20:15.937
You're a piece of...
- Spitzer, he's a great guy?

01:20:16.019 --> 01:20:18.269
First of all, Alex, this
ain't your fucking show.

01:20:18.356 --> 01:20:20.476
And, Roger, it surely
ain't your fucking show!

01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:23.316
Blowjob! Blowjob! Blowjob! Bullshit!
Bullshit! Bullshit!

01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:26.282
You're a hatchet man. I don't know why
anyone in the media takes you seriously.

01:20:26.364 --> 01:20:27.824
You're a lightweight.
You don't know anything.

01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:30.696
All you do is lie. You're known
as the biggest liar in media.

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:32.954
Name the lie. - The
biggest liar in media.

01:20:33.036 --> 01:20:35.536
Name a lie, loser. There's
nobody watching your show, dude.

01:20:35.623 --> 01:20:37.883
The guy starts pointing at me
and yelling like a maniac.

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:39.418
"You're a liar! A proven liar!"

01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:41.962
I say, "What have I lied about?"
He says, "Eliot Spitzer."

01:20:42.045 --> 01:20:45.295
I said, "He didn't like hookers?
He doesn't like to choke women?

01:20:45.383 --> 01:20:47.303
Don't you read the
newspapers, dude?"

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:52.347
He's gonna be considered
the Prince of Darkness.

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:57.601
And if he dies with that on his tombstone,
I think he'll consider himself a success.

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:21.248
I wanted to say hello.
- Hey. How are you?

01:21:21.334 --> 01:21:22.634
You remember...

01:21:25.673 --> 01:21:27.803
<i>Roger's relationship with Trump,</i>

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:31.013
<i>they both see the world
in a very similar way.</i>

01:21:31.094 --> 01:21:33.894
If Trump is elected president,
I think Roger will see

01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:37.642
one more very significant impact
he's had on world history.

01:21:47.445 --> 01:21:49.735
<i>I could not
be more proud tonight</i>

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:52.992
<i>to present to you and
to all of America,</i>

01:21:53.659 --> 01:22:00.289
my father and our next
president, Donald J. Trump.

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:19.227
Friends, delegates and
fellow Americans,

01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:25.569
I humbly and gratefully
accept your nomination

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:29.279
for the presidency of
the United States.

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:34.871
USA! USA! USA!

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:38.620
I would argue that Roger Stone, after
30 years working for Donald Trump,

01:22:39.246 --> 01:22:42.666
is one of his primary influences,
perhaps the primary influence.

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:47.050
<i>And to think that the guy who calls out
people on Twitter like Roger does,</i>

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:49.339
<i>who's done the things
and told the stories,</i>

01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:53.763
<i>is actually in the catbird
seat with a Republican nominee</i>

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:55.264
is something for
the record books.

01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:56.925
CNN has banned Roger Stone,

01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:59.274
the Republican strategist
and former Trump advisor,

01:22:59.349 --> 01:23:00.429
from appearing as a guest.

01:23:00.518 --> 01:23:05.148
This after the discovery of his offensive
tweets against CNN contributors.

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.610
Stone once called Ana Navarro

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:09.610
an "abusive diva" and
"borderline retarded."

01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:12.403
Stone also called
then-contributor Roland Martin

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:15.738
a "stupid negro," a
"moron" and a "token,"

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:18.244
and suggested he eat
more fried chicken.

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:21.156
To ban someone because you
disagree with their views

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:24.036
demonstrates you're not
really a news organization,

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:25.884
but you're an opinion
organization.

01:23:25.959 --> 01:23:29.919
CNN means Clinton News Network.

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:33.045
There are more people
watching Infowars.com

01:23:33.133 --> 01:23:37.103
than watching MSNBC and, at
some hours, CNN combined.

01:23:37.638 --> 01:23:40.308
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we are broadcasting worldwide.</i>

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:45.810
Roger Stone, the consummate Trump
insider, the vice-Trumpian joins us.

01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:49.686
You've got Alex Jones, he's like the
sort of main conspiracy theorist,

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:51.475
probably the most popular
in American life now.

01:23:51.569 --> 01:23:53.529
You know, Roger Stone goes
on that show every day.

01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:56.662
<i>There's this crazy vortex of all
that stuff back from the '90s</i>

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.410
just now sort of exploding
through the channel of Trump.

01:23:59.492 --> 01:24:01.372
I'm never a
lesser-of-two-evils person,

01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:03.713
but with Hillary, there's
not even the same universe.

01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:07.249
I mean, she is an abject,
psychopathic demon from hell.

01:24:07.334 --> 01:24:08.844
<i>Alex Jones
is very important.</i>

01:24:08.919 --> 01:24:13.049
I realize the elite media likes to
call him a conspiracy theorist.

01:24:13.131 --> 01:24:15.341
I don't like 'em putting
chemicals in the water

01:24:15.425 --> 01:24:17.585
that turns the
frickin' frogs gay!

01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:19.812
Do you understand that?

01:24:20.514 --> 01:24:22.474
I'm
sick of this crap!

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:27.058
<i>He has a bully pulpit that
allows him to reach millions of people,</i>

01:24:27.145 --> 01:24:28.765
and they are Trump's people.

01:24:28.856 --> 01:24:31.856
They are outsiders,
skeptical about government,

01:24:31.942 --> 01:24:35.402
skeptical about the bullshit government
is always trying to peddle you.

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:37.527
Mexico is a globalist
client state.

01:24:37.615 --> 01:24:39.865
And they teach 'em,
"America belongs to you.

01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:42.240
You're gonna get the gringo.
Plan of San Diego."

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:43.367
Don't know what that is?

01:24:43.453 --> 01:24:48.213
It's a plan to take over in a race war
and kill all whites below the age of 16.

01:24:48.291 --> 01:24:52.671
Sure it's a non-elitist , but
they're Americans and they vote.

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:56.724
Tell us, Mr. Trump, about Mr. Stone,
who helped get this interview set up.

01:24:57.134 --> 01:24:59.854
Well, Roger's a good guy,
and he is a patriot.

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:02.008
He's a tough cookie,
but people like him.

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:04.467
<i>But he's been so loyal
and so wonderful.</i>

01:25:04.557 --> 01:25:08.727
And thank God for the Breitbarts
and the Daily Callers

01:25:08.812 --> 01:25:11.822
and the Townhalls and
the Infowars.com

01:25:11.899 --> 01:25:16.819
and the so many alternative media
sites where we can learn the truth

01:25:16.904 --> 01:25:21.374
and we can tell the truth and
we can spread the truth.

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:24.329
This is not conservatism
as we have known it.

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:27.211
This is not Republicanism
as we have known it.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:31.080
These are racist ideas,
race-baiting ideas,

01:25:31.168 --> 01:25:34.758
anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant,
anti-women.

01:25:34.838 --> 01:25:41.678
All key tenets making up the emerging
racist ideology known as the alt-right.

01:25:41.762 --> 01:25:45.722
I think Trump should get more, you
know, more, quote, "conspiratorial."

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:47.688
We created ISIS.

01:25:47.768 --> 01:25:52.558
The vacuum created by George W. Bush
and then Hillary Clinton armed ISIS.

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:57.778
ISIS is honoring
President Obama.

01:25:57.861 --> 01:26:01.821
He is the founder of ISIS.
He's the founder of ISIS.

01:26:01.907 --> 01:26:04.197
I would say the cofounder

01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:09.044
would be Crooked Hillary
Clinton, cofounder.

01:26:09.122 --> 01:26:12.462
I think it's whatever Roger Stone e-mails
Donald Trump in the middle of the night.

01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:14.592
He wakes up, and that's
their strategy. - That's right.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:15.800
Excuse me.

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:21.974
<i>So go online and put
down "Hillary Clinton illness."</i>

01:26:22.052 --> 01:26:23.642
<i>Take a look at the
videos for yourself.</i>

01:26:23.721 --> 01:26:27.471
This fringe allegation that
Hillary Clinton is not well,

01:26:27.557 --> 01:26:29.887
her health isn't good, is
something that we're seeing

01:26:29.977 --> 01:26:31.767
<i>more and more with
Donald Trump supporters.</i>

01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:33.654
<i>Some of the Breitbart
readers have brought it up.</i>

01:26:33.731 --> 01:26:36.071
<i>Also, Roger Stone has
been talking about it.</i>

01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:38.819
She's got no stamina. I think
it's abundantly clear.

01:26:38.902 --> 01:26:42.912
She doesn't have the
strength or the stamina

01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:46.620
to make America great again.
Believe me.

01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:49.285
The people behind
Trump's candidacy,

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:53.041
including Giuliani, including Roger
Ailes, including Roger Stone,

01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:57.545
<i>including his so-called brain
trust, believe this stuff works.</i>

01:26:59.339 --> 01:27:01.469
<i>Now the children's
table is the adult table.</i>

01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:04.849
And Alex Jones is, you know,
passing the dinner rolls.

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:07.388
And we're all
conspiracy America now.

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:08.772
Thank you.

01:27:08.849 --> 01:27:12.019
<i>Even if Donald Trump
loses, I still win,</i>

01:27:12.102 --> 01:27:15.272
because the Stone brand has
been front and center,

01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:19.225
<i>and my brand of politics have
finally come into their own.</i>

01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:22.567
CNN, MSNBC, they're
now the fringe.

01:27:22.654 --> 01:27:26.664
Alt-right communications,
we are the mainstream.

01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:32.002
Did Trump really believe that Obama
was not born in the United States?

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:38.550
Does Roger Stone really believe that
Bill Clinton raped all these women?

01:27:38.628 --> 01:27:41.798
<i>You know, it doesn't matter
to them is more the point.</i>

01:27:41.882 --> 01:27:45.222
<i>It's their tactic in
the political wars.</i>

01:27:45.302 --> 01:27:50.392
And for them, there are no boundaries.
Anything goes. Anything that wins, fine.

01:27:50.473 --> 01:27:55.273
<i>Today, WikiLeaks
releasing 1,700 new stolen e-mails.</i>

01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:58.153
<i>The Clinton campaign
is accusing a top Trump advisor</i>

01:27:58.231 --> 01:28:01.231
<i>of scheming with WikiLeaks
and Russian intelligence</i>

01:28:01.318 --> 01:28:03.068
<i>against Hillary Clinton.</i>

01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:07.123
I, actually, have
communicated with Assange.

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:10.330
I believe the next
tranche of his documents

01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:12.700
pertain to the
Clinton Foundation.

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:15.498
Have you spoken with
the WikiLeaks founder?

01:28:15.582 --> 01:28:18.002
No, I have not spoken to Mr.
Assange,

01:28:18.085 --> 01:28:20.955
I have not met with Mr. Assange,
and I never said I had.

01:28:21.046 --> 01:28:23.046
<i>House Democrats
now saying in Washington,</i>

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:25.551
"Let's investigate Roger
Stone's ties to the Russians."

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:29.723
Has the FBI interviewed Roger Stone about
his communications with Julian Assange,

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:32.845
or his knowledge of how WikiLeaks got
these illegally obtained documents?

01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:34.313
I can't comment on that.

01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:36.482
<i>Only Mr. Assange
knows what he's going to do.</i>

01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:39.611
Now, I think he's a hero,
fighting the deep state,

01:28:39.689 --> 01:28:42.319
taking on both the Republicans
and the Democrats.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.400
Taking on the
establishment, really.

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:46.146
<i>Law enforcement
sources tell CNN</i>

01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:49.028
<i>that the FBI has been conducting
multiple investigations</i>

01:28:49.116 --> 01:28:53.446
<i>and it continues to examine allegations
against Roger Stone, a Trump supporter,</i>

01:28:53.536 --> 01:28:55.956
<i>about possible connections
to WikiLeaks.</i>

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:58.209
<i>Those probes include a
year-long investigation</i>

01:28:58.291 --> 01:29:00.291
<i>of Trump campaign
manager Paul Manafort</i>

01:29:00.377 --> 01:29:04.507
<i>and his firm and their alleged ties
to pro-Putin figures in Ukraine.</i>

01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:08.549
These cyberattacks come from the
highest levels of the Kremlin,

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:11.505
and they are designed to
influence our election.

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:14.846
I find that deeply disturbing,
and I think it's time...

01:29:14.933 --> 01:29:17.393
She has no idea whether it's Russia...
- ...you take a stand...

01:29:17.477 --> 01:29:18.767
...China, or anybody else.

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:22.654
I'm not quoting myself. I'm quoting 17...
- Hillary, you have no idea.

01:29:22.732 --> 01:29:25.652
<i>The Clinton thugs,
they're the ones saying,</i>

01:29:25.735 --> 01:29:29.525
"Donald Trump is a traitor to his
country, in bed with Vladimir Putin,"

01:29:29.614 --> 01:29:30.784
a man he's never even met.

01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:32.986
Russia, if you're listening,

01:29:33.076 --> 01:29:39.166
I hope you're able to find the
30,000 e-mails that are missing.

01:29:39.249 --> 01:29:42.039
It's the low road in
American politics.

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:47.667
<i>They have unabashedly embraced the
toughest tactics you can take.</i>

01:29:47.757 --> 01:29:50.677
And you can see it in Roger Stone,
and you can see it in Trump.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:53.390
I mean, no boundaries
to what they would do.

01:29:53.471 --> 01:29:55.771
They'll twist the truth
if they need to.

01:29:55.848 --> 01:29:57.978
They're cynical about politics.

01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:01.060
They think people who
take the high road

01:30:01.146 --> 01:30:05.356
or who try to act
virtuously are chumps.

01:30:05.442 --> 01:30:07.902
The Trump campaign's latest
reboot now underway.

01:30:07.986 --> 01:30:10.566
<i>Two new top officials who
Trump is bringing in.</i>

01:30:10.655 --> 01:30:13.325
<i>Pollster Kellyanne Conway
as campaign manager,</i>

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:18.368
<i>and Breitbart News honcho Steve Bannon
to be Trump's new campaign CEO.</i>

01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:21.575
<i>Sources say Manafort is
being, quote, "sidelined."</i>

01:30:21.666 --> 01:30:24.206
Another bombshell from the
Trump campaign today.

01:30:24.294 --> 01:30:27.974
The resignation of the embattled
campaign chairman Paul Manafort,

01:30:28.048 --> 01:30:30.088
amid a wave of bad headlines

01:30:30.175 --> 01:30:33.715
<i>and growing questions about
Manafort's connections to Russia.</i>

01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:37.143
Also added to the team is the
disgraced Fox News chief Roger Ailes,

01:30:37.224 --> 01:30:40.644
and also Roger Stone, who
is a political operative.

01:30:40.727 --> 01:30:45.107
<i>Roger Ailes, Roger Stone, Steve
Bannon, they play rough.</i>

01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:48.150
Bannon is a bomb thrower
in the Stone mold.

01:30:48.235 --> 01:30:51.775
Somebody I like enormously.
He's got guts.

01:30:51.863 --> 01:30:54.623
<i>He understands new
media in a way that</i>

01:30:54.699 --> 01:30:57.329
<i>I think no one else in
the Trump campaign did.</i>

01:30:57.410 --> 01:31:00.910
He understands the fine points of
the Clinton oeuvre, if you will.

01:31:00.998 --> 01:31:03.918
Uh, he has republished all
of my toughest material

01:31:04.001 --> 01:31:07.091
<i>from</i> The Clintons' War on
Women <i>at Breitbart News.</i>

01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:09.130
<i>So he understands the enemy</i>

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:11.884
better than, perhaps, anybody
else in the Trump campaign.

01:31:11.966 --> 01:31:15.426
And like Donald
Trump, he's fearless.

01:31:15.512 --> 01:31:18.562
He's tough as nails.
He's driven.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:22.310
Uh, I think he's the campaign's
secret weapon at this point.

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:25.234
Good evening, everybody.
It is now established,

01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:29.533
this is indeed the dirtiest presidential
campaign in modern history.

01:31:29.609 --> 01:31:31.529
<i>The last four
weeks of the campaign,</i>

01:31:31.611 --> 01:31:33.911
<i>Roger Stone said it's
going to be brutal.</i>

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:37.578
Earlier today, the <i>Washington Post</i>
released audio of Donald Trump from 2005.

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:42.705
<i>Kind of
relevant to people</i>

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:46.919
whether their future president
happens to also be a sexist pig.

01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:50.091
<i>A new poll reveals how
much that tape of Donald Trump</i>

01:31:50.172 --> 01:31:51.922
<i>is hurting his poll numbers.</i>

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:56.466
Breitbart and Roger Stone
are in Donald Trump's head

01:31:56.553 --> 01:31:59.183
telling him, "You need to
go all-out scorched-earth."

01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:03.444
Bill Clinton sexually
assaulted innocent women,

01:32:03.518 --> 01:32:08.108
and Hillary Clinton attacked
those women viciously.

01:32:08.190 --> 01:32:12.490
I expect in the fall that many of
these women will be speaking out.

01:32:12.569 --> 01:32:17.199
Bill Clinton raped me, and
Hillary Clinton threatened me.

01:32:17.282 --> 01:32:20.162
<i>Kathy Shelton
was paid $2,500 in May</i>

01:32:20.243 --> 01:32:22.623
<i>by a pro-Trump super PAC
run by Roger Stone.</i>

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:27.584
If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.
Mine are words and his was action.

01:32:27.667 --> 01:32:31.297
<i>After the most recent debate,
Clinton leads 49 to 41.</i>

01:32:31.379 --> 01:32:34.259
You've got Roger Stone running out
there saying that the system is rigged

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:36.260
<i>and that there'll be revolution
and blood in the streets.</i>

01:32:36.342 --> 01:32:39.972
It's just awfully good that someone
with the temperament of Donald Trump

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:42.974
is not in charge of the
law in our country.

01:32:43.057 --> 01:32:45.267
Because you'd be in jail.

01:32:45.352 --> 01:32:47.652
<i>FBI director
James Comey announced</i>

01:32:47.729 --> 01:32:51.069
<i>the bureau is renewing its investigation
into her personal e-mail server.</i>

01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:53.239
<i>Crooked Hillary Clinton.</i>

01:32:53.318 --> 01:32:55.278
It's not clear if the
tightening in the polls stems

01:32:55.362 --> 01:32:58.952
from FBI director James Comey's
widely condemned disclosure.

01:32:59.031 --> 01:33:01.661
Donald Trump has taken
this country to the brink.

01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:05.463
And tomorrow, voters are
likely to take it back.

01:33:13.796 --> 01:33:17.256
<i>Good morning to you.
576 days campaigning,</i>

01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:19.722
<i>more than 280 campaign events</i>

01:33:19.802 --> 01:33:22.722
<i>and now this historic
day is finally here.</i>

01:33:22.805 --> 01:33:25.765
Hillary Clinton calls this
election the test of our time.

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:28.690
<i>In Rochester, New York,
dozens put "I voted" stickers</i>

01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:31.230
<i>on the grave of suffragist Susan B.
Anthony</i>

01:33:31.314 --> 01:33:34.324
<i>on the day the first woman
nominee for president</i>

01:33:34.401 --> 01:33:36.441
<i>with a major party
was on the ballot.</i>

01:33:36.528 --> 01:33:38.818
We're looking at the first woman
president of the United States.

01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:41.115
Aren't you excited for the
first female president?

01:33:41.199 --> 01:33:42.909
No!
- I am.

01:33:42.992 --> 01:33:45.372
We can't go for Crooked Clinton.
We can't go for her.

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.713
If Hillary Clinton can run for
president, can you do anything?

01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:48.829
Yeah.

01:33:48.915 --> 01:33:51.165
<i>Hillary Clinton
is favored to win today.</i>

01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:54.091
<i>The polls have all shown her
ahead by four points or so.</i>

01:33:54.171 --> 01:33:57.261
I'm not fatalist. I just
see them with CNN, ABC,

01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.050
all about how Hillary's
gonna win all day.

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:00.933
And I see they're pre-scripting
she's gonna win.

01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:02.720
They're very hopeful.
They're optimistic.

01:34:02.804 --> 01:34:07.354
<i>A glass ceiling they're hoping to,
symbolically, burst through tonight.</i>

01:34:07.434 --> 01:34:10.904
Super excited. I wanna make sure
that I'm here to experience history.

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:14.478
What we see from the early returns is that
her ground game has really delivered.

01:34:14.566 --> 01:34:17.066
Let me tell you this, it is
Florida, Florida, Florida.

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:20.281
Donald Trump has
taken the lead in Florida.

01:34:20.363 --> 01:34:23.833
<i>I talked to some of my colleagues
in Trump Tower just a few minutes ago.</i>

01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:26.408
There's a little optimism here.

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:28.414
No one thought it was gonna
be this close at this point.

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:29.706
Trump can still win this.

01:34:29.789 --> 01:34:31.039
<i>We have another
state to project.</i>

01:34:31.123 --> 01:34:32.253
<i>It is North Carolina.</i>

01:34:32.334 --> 01:34:34.254
<i>Battleground state. It's
going to Donald Trump.</i>

01:34:34.336 --> 01:34:36.126
I was actually ready
to go to bed,

01:34:36.213 --> 01:34:39.013
uh, then I started seeing the
Electoral College come in,

01:34:39.090 --> 01:34:40.550
and I'm, like, super psyched.

01:34:40.633 --> 01:34:43.723
This is going to be a
very close election.

01:34:43.803 --> 01:34:46.313
I'm seeing these
late-breaking trends.

01:34:46.389 --> 01:34:50.889
This could hand Trump the presidency.
Folks, this is not, by any means, over.

01:34:50.977 --> 01:34:55.437
I think there's some real jitters setting
in at Clinton headquarters right now.

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:59.653
Wolf, the scene here is so different
than it was a few hours ago

01:34:59.736 --> 01:35:01.896
<i>when people were
happy and relaxed.</i>

01:35:01.988 --> 01:35:03.778
This is most unexpected.

01:35:03.865 --> 01:35:08.075
It certainly is a huge, huge surprise
to so many people out there...

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:10.830
<i>I think we all
thought it couldn't happen,</i>

01:35:10.913 --> 01:35:13.963
that he couldn't do what he did.
And guess what?

01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:15.791
He may just do it.

01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:20.337
<i>Donald Trump has taken the lead.
He has 216 electoral votes.</i>

01:35:20.423 --> 01:35:22.173
The beginning of the end for
Hillary Clinton's campaign.

01:35:22.259 --> 01:35:23.799
<i>He's pulling ahead
of Hillary Clinton.</i>

01:35:23.885 --> 01:35:24.885
<i>You see it there, 222...</i>

01:35:24.969 --> 01:35:29.139
...a number of groups who are
likely feeling real fear right now.

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:31.023
You've got women, immigrants,

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.400
who have been threatened by
Donald Trump with deportation.

01:35:33.478 --> 01:35:35.398
How do I explain
this to my children?

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.690
I have Muslim friends who
are texting me tonight,

01:35:38.775 --> 01:35:40.605
saying, "Should I
leave the country?"

01:35:40.693 --> 01:35:42.533
America is crying tonight.

01:35:42.612 --> 01:35:46.622
I'm not sure how much of America, but
a very, very significant portion.

01:35:46.699 --> 01:35:48.539
<i>And I mean literally crying.</i>

01:35:50.537 --> 01:35:52.577
Trump!
Trump! Trump!

01:35:52.664 --> 01:35:55.004
<i>This is a
very unexpected turn,</i>

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:59.632
<i>and now, his  here is saying,
"President Trump, President Trump,"</i>

01:35:59.712 --> 01:36:02.212
<i>and there is vast
celebration going on here.</i>

01:36:02.299 --> 01:36:04.969
<i>Donald Trump will be the
45th president of the United States.</i>

01:36:05.552 --> 01:36:07.142
Ah, yeah.

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:09.220
The basket of
deplorables has arrived.

01:36:11.557 --> 01:36:13.597
<i>People have
talked about a miracle.</i>

01:36:14.436 --> 01:36:16.346
<i>I'm hearing about a nightmare.</i>

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:19.267
USA! USA!

01:36:19.357 --> 01:36:22.857
<i>This is your life now. This is us.
This is our country.</i>

01:36:32.829 --> 01:36:34.329
<i>Stone's Rule.</i>

01:36:34.414 --> 01:36:36.714
<i>"Past is fucking prologue."</i>

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:41.590
<i>"Silent majority," "the
forgotten Americans."</i>

01:36:41.671 --> 01:36:44.131
<i>"I am the candidate
of law and order."</i>

01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:54.770
<i>It's not me who found this trend.
It's those who went before me.</i>

01:36:54.851 --> 01:36:58.861
<i>I just saw Trump's ability to
utilize it to become president.</i>

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:05.028
<i>This is the manifestation of
a dream I've had since 1988.</i>

01:37:05.111 --> 01:37:08.781
And I've always thought Donald Trump had
the size and the courage and the balls

01:37:08.865 --> 01:37:10.615
to become president
of the United States.

01:37:16.038 --> 01:37:19.668
<i>We're in the age of Stone because
the change in our politics,</i>

01:37:19.751 --> 01:37:24.381
<i>the rough-and-tumble cutthroat politics,
the slash-and-burn of what was just</i>

01:37:24.464 --> 01:37:28.684
probably the dirtiest, nastiest
campaign in American political history,

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:30.760
<i>are now in vogue.</i>

01:37:33.515 --> 01:37:36.675
<i>What message would you have
for the viewers of this film</i>

01:37:36.768 --> 01:37:39.268
who will loathe you
when the credits roll?

01:37:40.021 --> 01:37:42.191
I revel in your hatred,

01:37:42.273 --> 01:37:44.943
because if I weren't effective,
you wouldn't hate me.
