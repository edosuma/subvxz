WEBVTT

02:41.245 --> 02:42.829
My reminiscence.

02:43.539 --> 02:46.541
I always thought that
for such a lovely river,

02:46.625 --> 02:49.585
the name was mystifying,
Cape Fear.

02:50.254 --> 02:54.006
When the only thing
to fear on those
enchanted summer nights

02:54.341 --> 02:56.008
was that the magic
would end

02:56.093 --> 02:58.427
and real life would
come crashing in.

03:35.424 --> 03:38.467
GUARD: Okay, Cady,
the moment you've
been waiting for.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.036
Any people
coming for you, Cady?

04:05.495 --> 04:07.038
What about
your books?

04:07.122 --> 04:08.331
Already read them.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.333

04:36.068 --> 04:37.693
Hi. How are you?

04:37.861 --> 04:39.779
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

04:40.948 --> 04:42.198
(LAUGHING)

04:42.282 --> 04:43.616
This ropa limpia?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.786
No, no,
that means "clean."
These are dirty.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.122
LEIGH: The idea is to
resolve the tension.

04:50.207 --> 04:53.668
I need to find a motif
that's about movement.

04:54.878 --> 04:58.130
Not the most
mind-blowing concept
for a travel agency,

04:58.215 --> 05:00.049
but what the hey?

05:01.718 --> 05:03.094
Like an arrow,
maybe?

05:03.178 --> 05:04.512
Yeah, like an arrow.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.222
Maybe.

05:06.556 --> 05:10.017
But, see, then
the other aspect
is stability,

05:10.102 --> 05:11.936
a company
that you can trust.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.481
So if you can
balance those ideas

05:15.565 --> 05:19.110
in a way that's
pleasing to the eye,
then you got a logo.

05:19.194 --> 05:22.279
DANIELLE: Okay,
movement, stability,

05:22.364 --> 05:23.823
and an arrow.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.825
(LAUGHS)

05:25.909 --> 05:28.828
Okay, I'll think of
something for that one.

They switched babies
on me at the hospital,
didn't they, huh?

05:36.378 --> 05:37.753
So, how'd you do
in there?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.463
Well,
I got the judge
to postpone

05:39.548 --> 05:41.841
the alimony hearing
for another 21 days.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.092
Great.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.179
Well, I've got till Monday
to find out which S and L
and which municipality

05:47.264 --> 05:48.848
my son-in-law
stashed all that money.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.182
Right. Right.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.892
But, anyway,
I thank you and
my daughter thanks you.

Oh, you're welcome, Tom.

Yeah.

What do you mean?
You boxed.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.402
You could've
shoved him around,

07:25.487 --> 07:26.737
shut him up.
Yeah. Yeah.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.030
I could take you.
Careful.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.573
That's who
I could take.

kicked him in the face.

in the face?

do I owe you?

even know you exist,

is for the best, you know.

you know why you have
to ask that question?

never been married.
Why?

with deception?

you know,
when two people...

When two people
get married

09:18.934 --> 09:21.477
and they live together
for a long time,
you know...

09:23.688 --> 09:26.815

with you, you know,
so sue me.

and you're cute,
and, I don't know...

We talk about the courts
and which judge is senile

09:34.616 --> 09:37.201
and which one wears a gun
under his robe and...

that's good, actually,

I let you win.

10:03.853 --> 10:04.937
Hey.

10:05.689 --> 10:06.939
Free as a bird,
apparently.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.774
You go everywhere
you want with whomever.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.401
That much freedom
could maybe get
a fellow into trouble.

10:10.485 --> 10:11.485
What do you think?

10:11.569 --> 10:12.861
I'd like my keys.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.030
Could it be
you don't remember me?

10:15.365 --> 10:16.699
Oh, yeah, sure,
I remember you.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.033

at the movie house
the other night.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.244
Oh, I'm disappointed.
I'm hurt.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.121
I would like my keys.

Max Cady.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.043
You look the same.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.254
Maybe 15 pounds heavier.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.588
But they say
the average man

10:31.673 --> 10:34.091
gains a pound a year
till he's about...

10:34.175 --> 10:35.968
(CHUCKLING) Come on.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.888
Gains a pound a year
till he's about 60.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.058
Me? I dropped a pound
every year
of my sentence.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.855
Atlanta, '77.
You got it. July.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.191
Fourteen years since
I held a set of keys.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.780
Well, you look good,
healthy.

10:57.073 --> 11:00.659
Thank you. 'Cause it's
a struggle to stay healthy
in the joint.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.786
But you wouldn't
know about that,
would you?

11:03.079 --> 11:04.788
If you were me,
they would stick you
with the white trash.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.373
They don't strike
a lick of work all day.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.378
In fact,
this little old cigar
is my only vice

11:11.463 --> 11:15.007
'cause I needed
a vice in the joint
to remind me I was human.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.844
So, what brings you
to New Essex?

11:18.928 --> 11:20.554
Oh, the climate.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.474
Boy, the South.

11:23.558 --> 11:27.102
I'm thinking of
settling right down here
in New Essex, Counselor.

11:28.605 --> 11:29.688
Have you
been following me?

11:29.773 --> 11:31.065
It's a small town.
Everywhere you turn,

11:31.191 --> 11:32.733
I guess, we're gonna
run into each other.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.109

Mr. Cady.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.361
You, too.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.491
You're gonna learn
about loss.

11:40.575 --> 11:41.992
What?

11:52.128 --> 11:53.962
Dad, could you...

11:54.172 --> 11:55.506
Hmm?

11:55.799 --> 11:57.383
Oh, I'm sorry, Dani.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.344
What're you working on?
It's English.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.055
We're supposed to read
Look Homeward, Angel,

12:03.139 --> 12:05.057
which is a kind
of reminiscence,

12:05.141 --> 12:07.893
and we have to
attempt something
in the same style.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.022
What's it about,
your reminiscence?

12:13.233 --> 12:14.733
The houseboat.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.320
Oh, the houseboat.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.327
LEIGH: It's not even
July 3rd yet.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.412
Yeah.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.788
Yeah. I was thinking
we ought to take

12:27.872 --> 12:29.123
two weeks off and
go up to Wilmington

12:29.207 --> 12:30.707
like the old times,
dock the houseboat.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.459
I wanted to
in early June.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.169
Remember you said
you didn't have time
this summer.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.295
I probably don't.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.797
Yeah, well,
now I don't, either.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.341
Besides,
Dani's got summer school
till Labor Day.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.843
Is it really
that critical

12:40.927 --> 12:43.303
that she can't
miss two damn weeks?

12:43.388 --> 12:45.931
(SIGHS) Well, you know,
the alternative was
to expel her.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.767
Besides,
maybe this Drama teacher
from the college

12:48.852 --> 12:50.727
will get her excited
about something,
you know?

12:50.812 --> 12:52.855
Yeah, about him,
probably.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.023
I mean, why'd they have
to make such a stink,

12:55.108 --> 12:57.276
like she was on heroin,
or something?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.528
I mean, marijuana,
what's marijuana?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.572
You and I smoked
a little dope
in our time.

13:01.656 --> 13:02.739
Yeah.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.074
You know,
in some cultures,

13:04.159 --> 13:05.784
it's considered
almost a sacrament.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.870
Of course,
I realize in ours,
it's forbidden.

13:07.954 --> 13:13.125
Right up there with incest
and necrophilia
and bestiality.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.626
Honey. Honey. Honey.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.753
Worship of idols,
cannibalism.

13:16.838 --> 13:17.921
Do that again.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.715
What?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.216
Do that again.

13:21.551 --> 13:22.843

somebody's out there!
What?

15:16.541 --> 15:18.834
No, leave the light off.
Leave it off.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.256
I saw him when
the fireworks went off.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.424
(MURMURING)

15:25.508 --> 15:26.633
What?

15:27.093 --> 15:28.885
I think I talked
to him this afternoon.
You know him?

15:30.680 --> 15:33.181
I want you the hell
off my property!

15:46.195 --> 15:47.529
He's gone.

15:53.328 --> 15:56.830
He said, "I'm gonna
make you think
about loss."

15:56.914 --> 16:00.334
Or, "I'm gonna make
you learn about loss."
Something like that.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.336
That's very poetic.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.630
So, who is he?
Where did he come from?

16:04.714 --> 16:05.881
Well, he's from...

16:06.758 --> 16:09.301
Come on, Leigh,
get the dog off.
Ben, get down.

16:09.552 --> 16:10.677
(LAUGHS)

16:10.762 --> 16:12.554
He doesn't
mind me at all.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.139
Leigh, he's your dog.
Come on.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.683
No, he shouldn't
be up on the table.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.186
You're gonna have
dog hairs in the tea
and everything.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.021
Get down.
So where's he from?

16:21.105 --> 16:23.899
Oh, he's from the hills,
Pentecostal crackers,
you know.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.069
What was he
in prison for?

16:28.905 --> 16:30.489
I think it was battery.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.032
You think
it was battery?
Yeah.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.492
I mean, well,
who did he batter?

16:33.576 --> 16:35.827
Did he batter a man?
Did he batter a woman?
What?

16:35.912 --> 16:36.995
I don't know.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.248
It was 14 years ago.
You know, it's kind of...

16:40.917 --> 16:42.918
I really don't remember.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.088
What does he want
with you?

16:46.881 --> 16:49.675
He's just trying
to bug us,
just messing around.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.094
You know,
he's an ex-con,
so he's just...

16:52.595 --> 16:56.598
You know,
he's probably upset
at the lawyer.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.684
Yeah, your clientele.

16:58.768 --> 16:59.893
Yeah.

17:03.773 --> 17:04.856
Bye, Dad.
Bye, Dani.

17:04.941 --> 17:05.982
You look tired.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.193
Thanks.
I needed that. Leigh.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.069
Leigh,
I don't want
to alarm her,

17:10.154 --> 17:12.196
but I'd rather Dani
didn't wander out alone

17:12.281 --> 17:14.156
on her soul-searching
walks in the woods

17:14.242 --> 17:15.701
at least till I've
started a few things,

17:15.785 --> 17:17.202
maybe even talked
to the boss.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.869
What if she takes
Benjamin with her?

17:18.954 --> 17:20.497
What? Big Ben,
our guard dog?

17:20.580 --> 17:22.457
What's he gonna do,
lick him to death?

17:22.541 --> 17:24.084
Just tell her.
LEIGH: Tell her what?

17:24.167 --> 17:25.919
I hardly know anything
about the man.

17:26.002 --> 17:27.503
I don't mean
his biography.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.922
Just there's
some creep around.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.508
And if you see him again,
call the cops
and then call me.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.844
What about a weapon,
you know?

17:33.928 --> 17:36.888
In case things get
exciting around here.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.974
Look, Leigh,
would you really
feel more secure

17:39.058 --> 17:40.434
with a loaded gun
in the house?

17:40.518 --> 17:42.853
We'd probably end up
using it on each other.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.396
Or Dani would.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.690
He's not gonna do anything.
He just got out of prison.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.067
He doesn't want
to go right back.
All right?

17:51.738 --> 17:53.321
Call Lee Heller.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.407
Lee is
a colorful character,

17:55.491 --> 17:57.409
but he's still the best
criminal lawyer
in the state.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.661
Good.
Bonnie,
get me Lee Heller.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.748
Sam, you defended
this guy, right?

18:02.832 --> 18:03.790
Right.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.751
So, what makes you think
he wants to harm you?

18:05.835 --> 18:07.794
Yesterday I was
getting in my car.

18:07.879 --> 18:10.630
The guy comes up,
we have a little
conversation.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.967
He says to me,
"You're gonna
learn about loss."

18:15.261 --> 18:18.180
That'd hardly qualify
under the terrorist
threat statutes.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.308
Oh, come on, Tom,
for Christ's sake,
the guy's an ex-con.

18:21.392 --> 18:24.394
You know
as well as I do
what that means.

18:24.479 --> 18:27.189
I mean, last night,
there he was,
he was behind our house.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.940
Ah. Attempted B and E.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.275
No, not exactly.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.987
I mean,
he was sitting on a wall
that bounds our property.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.782
(LAUGHS) That's not
even trespassing, Sam.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.492
I mean, come on.
What can I say?

18:38.576 --> 18:40.160
I mean,
get a restraining order.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.580
I did.
I filed one this morning.
The hearing's in 10 days.

18:43.664 --> 18:47.042
Good. Good.
I mean, you know,
anything I can do.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.211
Tom, 14 years ago

18:50.713 --> 18:54.049
in this case
I had a report
on the victim.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.218
It was a rape case.
That's right.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.637
Rape and
aggravated sexual battery.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.472
Anyway,
I had a report
on this victim

19:00.556 --> 19:03.558
and it came back that
she was promiscuous.

19:05.603 --> 19:06.686
And...

19:07.897 --> 19:09.314
I buried it.

19:10.733 --> 19:11.983
Whew.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.070
Anybody else know
about this?

19:15.196 --> 19:16.321
No, no, no,
I buried it.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.531
I mean,
I didn't show it
to the client,

19:17.615 --> 19:19.825
I didn't show it
to the prosecution.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.786
But if you had seen
what this guy had
done to this girl...

19:23.162 --> 19:26.039
"In every
criminal prosecution,
the accused shall have

19:26.123 --> 19:27.999
"the Assistance of
Counsel for his defense."

19:28.084 --> 19:29.251
I know
the Sixth Amendment.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.669
I believe in
the Sixth Amendment.

19:30.753 --> 19:33.296
I mean, that's why I left
the Public Defender's Office.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.174
There was no way
to serve the law
in that capacity.

19:36.259 --> 19:37.259
Some folks just
don't have the right

19:37.343 --> 19:38.426
to the best defense,
huh, Sam?

19:38.511 --> 19:40.679
No! Of course
they deserve
the best defense!

19:40.763 --> 19:43.473
But, I mean,
if you had seen what
he did to this girl...

19:43.558 --> 19:44.766
You buried the report.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.268
I mean, if it was
your own daughter, Tom.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.354
Yeah, I mean...
Buried the report.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.189
Jesus, Sam.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.234
Oh, God.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.320
(SIGHS)

19:58.781 --> 20:01.157
But I don't see how
he could know that.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.409
I mean,
he was illiterate.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.661
I mean, I had to
read everything to him,

20:04.745 --> 20:06.162
the probable
cause affidavit,

20:06.247 --> 20:08.540
the arrest reports,
everything.

20:10.293 --> 20:12.711
There's no way
he could know that.

20:23.931 --> 20:28.059
Hey, Dani,
it's so quiet out here,
and the light's so perfect,

20:28.144 --> 20:31.313
why don't you get your book
and come out here and read?

20:31.397 --> 20:32.480
Why?

20:33.566 --> 20:34.983
I told you why.

20:35.484 --> 20:39.321
Well, is it because
he's like a flasher
or just a peeper?

20:39.780 --> 20:42.198
What do you know
about that?
A flasher?

20:42.283 --> 20:45.035
Oh, you don't think
I've been flashed
before?

20:45.328 --> 20:47.412
Oh, well,
I certainly didn't mean
to insult you.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.247
I'm sure you've
been flashed before.

20:49.332 --> 20:52.125
Look, if you want to
come out, come on out.
If you don't, go on.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.252
Do whatever you want.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.172
Oh, but don't
go outside.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.930
CADY: Afternoon,
Counselor.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.894
What do you want,
Mr. Cady?

21:11.854 --> 21:13.188
(GIRLS LAUGHING)

21:19.153 --> 21:21.613
They're great at
that age, ain't they?

21:21.697 --> 21:24.157
All those discoveries
ahead of them.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.533
You're lucky,
Counselor.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.828
My own daughter,
she don't even know me.

21:29.246 --> 21:32.123
After I went inside,
her mama told her
I was dead,

21:32.208 --> 21:34.125
which, in a way,
I was.

21:34.627 --> 21:38.546
Look, Mr. Cady,
I realize that
you suffered.

21:38.714 --> 21:39.756
(LAUGHS)

21:39.840 --> 21:42.759
I mean,
I understand your problem,
but, I mean, why me?

21:43.552 --> 21:46.221
I was your lawyer.
I defended you.

21:46.931 --> 21:49.808
I mean,
why not badger the D.A.
Or the judge?

21:49.892 --> 21:50.976
(LAUGHING) "Badger."

21:51.060 --> 21:52.102
Yeah. Why not them?

21:52.770 --> 21:55.021
Yeah. Why not them?
"Badger."

21:56.107 --> 21:59.109
Best I remember,
they was just doing
right by their jobs.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.695
Oh, I didn't do my job?
Is that right?

22:02.446 --> 22:05.490
Look, I pleaded you out to
a lesser occluded offense.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.826
You could've gotten rape
instead of battery.

22:07.910 --> 22:10.161
Oh, I'd have been up
for parole either way
in seven years

22:10.246 --> 22:11.454
according to the
Georgia penal code.

22:11.539 --> 22:12.539
Rape is
a capital offense.

22:12.623 --> 22:15.166
I mean,
you could've gotten life,
you could've done death.

22:15.251 --> 22:18.128
You could be sitting
on death row right now.

22:19.922 --> 22:22.465
I learned to read
during my stretch.

22:23.092 --> 22:26.678
First,
Spot Goes to the Farm,

22:26.762 --> 22:30.056
then Runaway Bunny,
then law books, mostly.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.185
Did you know that
after I discharged you,

22:34.270 --> 22:36.104
I acted as
my own attorney?

22:36.689 --> 22:38.690
Applied several times
for an appeal.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.650
No, I didn't know that.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.361
Mmm-hmm.

22:43.446 --> 22:45.530
So, here we are,

22:45.614 --> 22:49.117
two lawyers,
for all practical purposes,
talking shop.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.037
All right. How much
do you want, Mr. Cady?

22:53.289 --> 22:54.873
How much
do I want what?

22:54.957 --> 22:57.083
How much money
do you want?

22:57.418 --> 23:01.004
Money? Counselor,
do I look destitute
to you?

23:01.088 --> 23:04.257
Well,
I'm open to discussion,
within reasonable limits.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.178
You ever been a woman?

23:08.596 --> 23:09.637
A what?

23:09.722 --> 23:10.764
A woman.

23:12.475 --> 23:15.727
Some fat, hairy,
ugly hillbilly's
wet dream?

23:20.066 --> 23:21.191
Look, I realize that
you suffered in prison.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.275
Suffered.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.693
There's no question
about that.
"Suffered."

23:23.778 --> 23:26.654
You don't know
what suffering is,
Counselor.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.574
Like it says
in Galatians 3,

23:29.658 --> 23:32.494
"Have ye suffered
so many things in vain?"

23:33.829 --> 23:34.871
Yeah.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.915
I learned from
the get-go in the joint
to get in touch

23:36.999 --> 23:40.668
with the soft
nurturing side of myself,
the feminine side.

23:45.674 --> 23:50.386
Well, I'm open to
some sort of discussion
on compensation.

23:51.597 --> 23:54.057
What shall be
my compensation, sir,

23:54.141 --> 23:57.352
for being held down
and sodomized
by four white guys

23:57.436 --> 23:59.395
or four black guys?

24:00.815 --> 24:02.899
Shall my compensation
be the same?

24:02.983 --> 24:06.027
What is the formula
for compensation, sir?

24:06.403 --> 24:08.696
How about $10,000
in cash?

24:11.700 --> 24:12.909
Do I...

24:16.997 --> 24:18.623
Well, let's just
break that down.
No.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.792
Now, wait, wait,
wait a minute.
Let's just break it down.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.252
You see,
that figure just came
to the top of my head.

24:22.336 --> 24:23.920
Well, let's just say,
for argument's sake,

24:24.004 --> 24:27.132
let's say $20,000,
let's say $30,000.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.342
Say...
I'll tell you what.
Let's say $50,000.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.804
$50,000 into 14 years.

24:32.888 --> 24:36.641
Fourteen years times
365 days is about...

24:37.184 --> 24:38.935
I say about 5,000 days.

24:39.019 --> 24:43.398
Now,
you divide that by $50,000,
and that's like $10 a day.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.609
(LAUGHING) That's
not even minimum wage.

24:46.694 --> 24:50.572
To say nothing about
the family that I lost,
the respect that I lost.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.991
I don't think you really,
really understand

24:53.075 --> 24:55.160
what we're
talking about here.

24:55.244 --> 24:56.744
Fourteen years.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.746
(WATCH BEEPING)

24:59.039 --> 25:00.748
Whoops. Uh-oh.

25:00.833 --> 25:01.916
Gotta git.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.793
(STARTS ENGINE)
I'm late for
another appointment.

25:09.091 --> 25:11.050
Sam, my man,
I got some good news.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.052
I got the bank,
I got the account number.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.971
Great. I'll call your
son-in-law's lawyer,

25:15.055 --> 25:16.139
tell him we're going
to court.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.516
Mr. Bowden,
your wife's
on line one.

25:18.601 --> 25:20.560
Ask her to hold.
I got to make
a quick call.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.729
I wouldn't make
that call, Sam.
The way I'd...

25:22.813 --> 25:24.898
Mr. Bowden,
she says it's urgent.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.403
Yeah?

25:32.990 --> 25:36.451
...these kind of horrible,
high-pitched howls.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.162
They sounded like
he was screaming,

25:39.246 --> 25:40.580
and then Dani
came running in,

25:40.664 --> 25:41.915
and I...

25:43.459 --> 25:45.126
I called the vet.

25:47.087 --> 25:49.380
Then it was so weird
because

25:52.843 --> 25:55.178
it was like
he was winding down,

25:56.096 --> 25:59.390
just winding down
like an old clock.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.727
And then,
all of a sudden,
he just stopped.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.356
He had this kind of...

26:08.359 --> 26:11.319
His eyes just wide open,
and this kind of

26:13.572 --> 26:15.114
surprised look.

26:16.951 --> 26:18.326
And then...

26:21.705 --> 26:23.331
And then he died.

26:25.334 --> 26:28.795
He just died,
before the vet
even got here.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.674
What did the vet say?

26:33.342 --> 26:34.467
That he was poisoned.

26:34.551 --> 26:35.677
Poisoned?

26:36.095 --> 26:37.637
What kind of a poison?

26:39.014 --> 26:40.515
I don't know
what kind of poison.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.599
Oh, Jesus!

26:41.684 --> 26:43.142
Leigh, I told you not
to let him out.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.477
I didn't let him out!

26:44.561 --> 26:45.603
Well, then how...

26:45.688 --> 26:47.605
I didn't let him out!
Stop!

26:47.690 --> 26:48.815
(DOOR SLAMS CLOSED)

26:49.066 --> 26:50.858
I've got
an English Setter myself,

26:50.943 --> 26:53.278
so I don't cotton
to dog killers.

26:53.362 --> 26:56.406
Trouble is,
poisoning a dog
is just a fine.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.701
But if he's unemployed,
he got to have money

26:59.785 --> 27:01.369
or we'll bust him
for vagrancy.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.205
We'll give him
a full-body strip search.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.750
Jerk a knot
in his tail.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.794
All right.

27:11.088 --> 27:14.882
They got so many ways
on the books to lean
on an undesirable.

27:15.384 --> 27:17.135
He'll feel about
as welcome around here

27:17.219 --> 27:18.344
as a case
of yellow fever.

27:18.429 --> 27:19.637
OFFICER 1: Hands
against the wall.

27:19.722 --> 27:21.931
Spread them.
Spread them.

27:22.016 --> 27:24.017
That him?
OFFICER 2: Face the wall.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.893
One-way mirror,
Mr. Bowden.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.520
He doesn't
know you're here.

27:27.604 --> 27:29.397
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.316
Get the shirt off.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.068
Come on, hurry up.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.154
Let's go.
Just pass it
over to him.

27:38.407 --> 27:39.949
Hand it to me.

27:40.034 --> 27:41.534
All right.
Knock off the shoes.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.079
Hand them to
the other officer.

27:46.749 --> 27:49.083
Pass them to him.
Come on, come on.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.629
All right.
Let's put the arms out.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.590
Put your arms
out straight.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.635
Roll your palms.
OFFICER 2:
Do what he says.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.682
OFFICER 1:
Turn around, slow.

28:11.565 --> 28:13.232
(SCOFFS)

28:13.776 --> 28:16.861
I don't know whether
to look at him
or read him.

28:20.324 --> 28:21.741
OFFICER 1:
Stand still.

28:24.286 --> 28:27.163
OFFICER 2:
One more step for you.
You know the routine.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.792
Against the wall.

28:31.460 --> 28:34.879
We searched his apartment.
His car registration
and everything's in order.

28:34.963 --> 28:38.549
There's no guns or
any other weapons.
But we found these.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.054
ELGART: Cady's
savings account.

28:43.806 --> 28:44.931
$30,000?

28:45.682 --> 28:47.892
Yeah, well, see,
his mother died
while he was serving

28:47.976 --> 28:50.061
and the farm
got sold off.
He got the proceeds.

28:50.312 --> 28:53.231
Well, he's got money.
Where does that leave us?

28:53.315 --> 28:55.066
ELGART: Well,
at the very least,
we nail him for the dog.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.192
Now, what happened?

28:56.485 --> 28:58.027
You let the dog out.
Cady abducted him.

28:58.112 --> 28:59.153
No.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.365
We didn't
let the dog out.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.617
Cady came
into your house?

29:04.701 --> 29:06.452
That's illegal entry
with intent.

29:06.537 --> 29:09.747
Yeah. But he didn't
come in the house.

29:10.999 --> 29:14.669
Look, I'm not a cop.
I don't know exactly
how he did it.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.213
I just know that
he did it somehow.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.465
That's not good enough,
Mr. Bowden.

29:19.550 --> 29:21.676
Now, you're a lawyer.
You damn well know that.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.428
OFFICER 1:
Get off the pants.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.309
Sooner or later,
he's gonna screw up.

29:30.394 --> 29:32.019
I mean, the sheriff
assured me

29:32.104 --> 29:34.105
that they always do.
He's an ex-con.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.691
And then he's going
to get the message
in no uncertain terms.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.276
I'd still like
to kill him.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.697
(BAND PLAYING)

29:50.789 --> 29:52.373
(CROWD CHEERING)

30:01.717 --> 30:04.802
Now, Dani, how come
you didn't join up
with them? You can tap.

30:04.887 --> 30:07.013
Yeah, you can do that.
You can tap dance.

30:07.097 --> 30:11.225
I wanted to once,
but I don't know...

30:21.487 --> 30:22.612
Son of a bitch.

30:22.696 --> 30:23.738
What?

30:28.869 --> 30:30.161
He's staring at you.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.496
What are you
talking about?

30:36.627 --> 30:38.377
What the hell
are you doing?

30:38.462 --> 30:40.755
Hot as a firecracker
on the 4th of July.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.051
You're damn lucky
to have her, boy.

30:45.135 --> 30:46.552
You son of a bitch.

30:46.637 --> 30:48.262
Where did he go?

30:48.597 --> 30:49.972
Son of a...

30:54.895 --> 30:57.855
Watch my arm.
Watch my arm.
It might be broke.

30:58.232 --> 30:59.357
What's with you, buddy?

30:59.441 --> 31:01.192
You have no right
to be pushing me
around like that.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.318
I was just
watching the parade.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.486
I wasn't pranking
on nobody.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.946
You son of a bitch!

31:05.030 --> 31:07.365
What are you getting
so upset about?

31:07.741 --> 31:09.200
You're lucky
I don't sue you.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.578
All right.
All right.

31:12.663 --> 31:13.663
MAN: Settle down.

31:13.747 --> 31:15.039
SAM: I am. I am.
I am settled down.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.292
Sam,
what are you doing?

31:18.377 --> 31:19.377
Oh, it's nothing.

31:19.461 --> 31:21.420
Who was that?
It's no one.

31:21.505 --> 31:22.922
Who was that?
No one. Come on.

31:23.006 --> 31:26.133
The fellow with the tie,
his wife took him away.

31:27.302 --> 31:28.678
MAN: I think
he really hurt his arm.

31:28.762 --> 31:29.929
Mom!

31:32.224 --> 31:34.809
LORl: That's an awfully
strong drink you've
got there, mister.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.435
CADY: You said it, boy.
(LAUGHS)

31:36.520 --> 31:40.106
You just put
a little goldfish in it,
and you'll be fine.

31:41.984 --> 31:43.901
You seem to be
having a good time.

31:43.986 --> 31:45.403
I've been practicing.

31:45.487 --> 31:46.862
Practicing for what?

31:47.656 --> 31:48.698
How to fall
on the floor?

31:48.782 --> 31:50.116
A life of debauchery.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.284
"Debauch," what?

31:51.618 --> 31:54.328
Debauchery.
It's a three-syllable word.
Yeah.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.038
(LAUGHING)

31:56.123 --> 31:58.583
Making fun of me?
That's okay. No problem.

31:58.667 --> 31:59.834
No, I'm not. I'm not.

31:59.918 --> 32:00.918
I made you blush.

32:01.003 --> 32:01.961
Blush?

32:02.045 --> 32:05.715
Yes. You're now the color
of your shirt, scarlet.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.383
(CHUCKLES)

32:08.218 --> 32:11.637
I had no business
getting stuck on a guy
who was married.

32:11.722 --> 32:13.306
You certainly did not.

32:13.390 --> 32:14.932
I don't know
what I was thinking.

32:15.017 --> 32:17.018
God only knows.

32:17.185 --> 32:19.604
Now aren't I the bozo
on this bus?

32:20.689 --> 32:24.108
Oh, God. Lest you think
that I slept with
this particular

32:24.234 --> 32:26.110
married guy...
That's your business.
Not mine.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.570
I don't want to
make it sound like

32:27.654 --> 32:28.988
I've been through
a busload of them.

32:29.740 --> 32:32.033
That's the way
it sounded to me.

32:32.326 --> 32:33.409
He was the first.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.535
Oh, yeah.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.078
He was, I swear.

32:36.163 --> 32:37.288
Oh, yeah.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.206
Oh, boy.
Tell it to the judge.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.083

32:43.086 --> 32:44.629
Actually the rat
stood me up today.

32:44.713 --> 32:45.713
Did he?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.256
Yes!
What a shame.

32:47.341 --> 32:48.549
I know.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.719
So, now it's my turn.
Where are you from?

32:51.803 --> 32:52.887
Where am I from?
Yes.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.972
You're gonna love this.
Yes.

32:55.057 --> 32:59.352
I'm from
the Georgia State
Correctional Facility.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.228
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

33:06.401 --> 33:08.027
Now you think I'm joking?
That's the truth.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.487
I just got released
from prison.

33:09.738 --> 33:13.366
Oh, my God.
This is the way my day
has been turning out.

33:14.785 --> 33:16.994
Actually,
it reminds me
of a joke.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.205
Do you want
to hear it?
Tell me.

33:19.289 --> 33:20.790
Liven up the night.
All right.

33:21.458 --> 33:24.001
An unmarried woman...

33:24.086 --> 33:25.711
Wait a minute,
that's not it.
An unmarried woman...

33:25.796 --> 33:27.380
Come on, get the joke
straight, darling.

33:27.464 --> 33:29.256
Shut up. Shut up.
Let me do it.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.217
An unmarried woman,
she meets a guy

33:31.301 --> 33:34.178
and he tells her
he just got out
of prison.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.013
"What did you do?"
She asks.

33:36.098 --> 33:38.849
"I hacked my wife
into 52 pieces
with a chain saw."

33:38.934 --> 33:40.267
(LAUGHS LOUDLY)

33:41.436 --> 33:44.146
She says,
"So, you're single?"

33:45.273 --> 33:46.899
That's even funnier.
Thank you.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.318
Could I ask you
something?
What?

33:49.444 --> 33:51.028
What did you do?
I knew you were
going to ask that.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.656
I hacked my wife
into 52 pieces.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.741
I was afraid you were
gonna say that.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.120
Well, I'm a very
small person,
so maybe...

33:59.204 --> 34:01.706
Maybe I can hack you
into 40 pieces.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.249
(BOTH LAUGHING)

34:06.586 --> 34:07.712
What did you do,
really?

34:07.796 --> 34:09.797
"No, really,
but what did you do?"

34:11.882 --> 34:16.094
No, I just...
There was this protest march
on this nuclear power plant,

34:16.179 --> 34:18.723
and so when they came
to arrest us,

34:18.806 --> 34:21.391
this macho sheriff
got a tad rough with
the lady behind me,

34:21.476 --> 34:23.476
so, I popped
the little bastard,

34:23.562 --> 34:25.312
so they gave me
a little time for it.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.692
I'm drinking a Sea Breeze.
I hope you can afford them.

34:29.775 --> 34:30.943
But you gotta
stay sober.

34:31.027 --> 34:34.071
If you ain't sober,
then you're taking
your chances.

34:34.156 --> 34:36.157
Because I'm just
one hell of an animal.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.199
Yeah? Do tell.

34:40.328 --> 34:43.873
Get you on
this side, doll.
Let's do this.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.666
Who is Loretta anyway?

34:45.751 --> 34:48.127
That's the love of my life.
She's no longer with us.

34:48.210 --> 34:49.420
I thought
I was the love
of your life.

into 52 pieces.

34:57.471 --> 34:58.554
He hurt you like this,
that married guy?

34:58.638 --> 34:59.638
No.

34:59.723 --> 35:00.765
He hurt you like this?

35:00.849 --> 35:03.100
I told you,
we never did anything.

35:03.185 --> 35:04.602
He hurt you like this?

35:04.686 --> 35:06.771
Oh, scandal.

He's a rough one.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.524
How's this feel?

35:13.403 --> 35:16.197
Oh, my God.
Am I under arrest?

Not quite, darling.

it's all a mistake.

That married guy
hurt you like this?

hurt a lot worse than this!

you said it was battery.

Well, yeah,
the case was wobbly.
I got it reduced.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.797
I'm so stupid.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.132
Oh, Lori, don't.

37:44.596 --> 37:47.431
You stood me up
at the club
the other day.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.476
And then
you didn't call.

37:52.562 --> 37:57.566
And by last night,
I was feeling
pretty reckless.

37:59.194 --> 38:01.904
I thought about
what you said,
you know,

38:01.988 --> 38:05.991
that your wife,
she didn't know
I existed.

38:07.452 --> 38:11.455
And I felt like
I was going
to show you.

38:11.581 --> 38:12.706
(SOBBING)

38:13.500 --> 38:16.418
I guess I showed you,
all right, didn't I?

38:18.004 --> 38:20.339
I guess
I really showed you.

38:25.095 --> 38:27.805
Lori, listen to me,
okay?

38:28.723 --> 38:33.978
Now, look, this guy Cady,
he's done this kind
of thing before.

38:35.188 --> 38:38.607
Now, he's going to
do this over
and over again

38:38.692 --> 38:42.027
unless you testify and
we take him to court...

38:42.112 --> 38:43.278
No. No. No.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.948
And press charges
and testify.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.825
Lori.
Sam.

38:47.909 --> 38:52.287
Sam, I know,
I know how it works.
I see it every day.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.916
Only this time,
I'm on the other side.

38:57.002 --> 39:00.629
I don't want to
explain why I was
in a bar

39:00.714 --> 39:04.216
and how much
I had to drink and
what I was wearing.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.593
Not by the people
I work with.

39:06.678 --> 39:10.848
Not by the guys that
I see cross-examine
other people on the stand,

39:10.932 --> 39:15.686
just crucify them
and just laugh
about it later.

39:17.272 --> 39:19.440
They'll even ask
about you.

39:21.234 --> 39:24.194
Lori, listen to me.
I don't care about that.

39:24.279 --> 39:26.405
Well, I care about that.

39:27.741 --> 39:29.575
I'm sure you do, too.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.077
I'm...

39:32.954 --> 39:36.415
I'm terribly sorry, Lori.
I'm just terribly sorry.

39:39.961 --> 39:40.961
ELGART: Look.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.589
If all this is
something personal

39:43.673 --> 39:45.215
between you and
the girl and Cady...

39:45.300 --> 39:46.800
Personal? I mean...

39:47.802 --> 39:49.178
All right, come on,
Lieutenant.

39:49.262 --> 39:50.512
All right.
What are you implying?

39:50.597 --> 39:52.014
Only that there
are some things

39:52.098 --> 39:54.016
that are better
handled quietly.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.768
Not by the police.
(LAUGHS)

39:56.603 --> 39:58.562
This Cady guy
is planning to
rape my wife,

39:58.646 --> 39:59.813
but it's not
your problem anymore?

40:00.148 --> 40:02.399
I can't bust someone
for planning to
rape your wife.

40:02.484 --> 40:04.985
You're a lawyer, Mr. Bowden.
You know that damn well.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.321
Thanks all the same.
The way I'd handle it...

40:07.405 --> 40:09.573
What,
file a restraining order?
I already did.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.742
Just think of
this fellow Cady
as a tiger.

40:11.993 --> 40:14.161
The trick is to
get him out
of the brush.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.704
Now how do we
do that?

40:15.914 --> 40:18.624
You stake out
a couple of your goats
and hide in a tree.

40:18.708 --> 40:20.000
What are you suggesting,
Lieutenant?

40:20.585 --> 40:23.587
That I use
my family as bait?
And then what?

40:23.671 --> 40:25.756
What? I'm gonna hope
that this psychopath

40:25.840 --> 40:27.591
attacks my wife
and child?

40:27.675 --> 40:29.259
And then what?
Blow his head off?

40:29.344 --> 40:30.385
I'm a law officer.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.764
It would be
unethical of me
to advise a citizen

40:33.848 --> 40:35.849
to take the law
into his own hands.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.352
So, I suppose you must've
misunderstood me.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.853
Oh, I guess I must've.

40:40.688 --> 40:43.148
Well, pardon me
all over the place.

41:09.134 --> 41:12.386
And he's been
harassing my family,
but he's clever.

41:12.762 --> 41:15.347
I mean, cleverly,
so that the law
can't touch him.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.141
Also I believe
that he's able to slip

41:17.225 --> 41:18.892
into the house
and out undetected.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.644
Although, is he out?
I can't tell.

41:20.728 --> 41:23.522
He's either out
or he's in.
I'm not sure.

41:23.606 --> 41:25.107
Well, I can't
see through walls,
Mr. Bowden.

41:25.191 --> 41:28.777
I'm not asking you
to see through walls.
That's fine.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.863
I mean,
why can't anybody
do anything for me?

41:30.947 --> 41:32.906
What good are cops
and laws...

41:32.991 --> 41:34.741
Sam, Sam, Sam,
calm down.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.660
Let me explain
something to you.

41:36.744 --> 41:39.496
See, the system
is set up to handle
generalized problems

41:39.581 --> 41:41.623
like burglary
and robbery.

41:42.250 --> 41:45.544
But if some lone creep
out there targets you
for some obscure reason,

41:45.628 --> 41:48.964
the system is
slow and skeptical.
It's pathetic even.

41:50.425 --> 41:51.925
What's your connection
with this fellow?

41:52.010 --> 41:53.135
(SIGHS)

41:53.344 --> 41:55.429
I was his lawyer,
his public defender.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.472
But you shafted
him somehow, right?
(LAUGHS)

41:58.433 --> 42:00.350
Well, at least that's
the way he perceives it.
Sam, Sam.

42:00.435 --> 42:03.103
I don't care
what you did.
What did he do?

42:03.563 --> 42:05.689
He raped
a 16-year-old girl.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.400
Do you have a daughter
around sixteen?

42:09.319 --> 42:10.569
She's fifteen.

42:11.529 --> 42:12.613
All right.
Here's the deal.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.156
I'll do a background check
on him,

42:14.240 --> 42:16.283
follow him for about a week
and write you up
a risk assessment.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.618
All right, good.
Great, great.

42:17.702 --> 42:18.702
Now, the cops...

42:18.786 --> 42:20.120
I can find him.

42:20.205 --> 42:21.830
His name's Max Cady.
You already told me.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.249
Just take it easy.
Stay calm.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.836
Now, Dani, you can
just relax because

42:27.921 --> 42:31.632
your daddy has
a private investigator
on the payroll.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.759
Isn't that right?

42:34.636 --> 42:37.638
What's your feeling
about him?
What, Sam Spade?

42:38.014 --> 42:40.474
Mickey Spillane?
Peter Gunn?

42:41.601 --> 42:43.393
Dirty Harry?
Perry Mason?

42:43.478 --> 42:45.062
No, no, no, no.
Perry Mason...

42:45.146 --> 42:46.480
Perry Mason
was a lawyer.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.398
No, the minute
I walked in
this guy's office,

42:48.483 --> 42:49.733
I felt totally relaxed.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.818
I mean, this guy is
totally in charge.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.862
Kersek deals
with these types
for a living.

42:53.947 --> 42:56.073
He looked like
he was going
to enjoy...

42:56.157 --> 42:57.449
(TELEPHONE RINGS)
(ALL GASP)

42:59.035 --> 43:00.744
Yes?
Yeah, it's me.

43:00.828 --> 43:03.205
After you left,
I had this interesting
conversation

43:03.289 --> 43:05.040
with a C.O. Over at
Statesboro prison.

43:05.250 --> 43:07.584
Mmm-hmm.
Seems our man Cady had
a job in the kitchen.

43:07.669 --> 43:08.669
Right.

43:08.753 --> 43:10.295
There was this other
inmate working in there
with him,

43:10.380 --> 43:12.089
he was an obstinate
S. O.B.
Right.

43:12.590 --> 43:13.924
He hated Cady's
cigar smoke

43:14.008 --> 43:16.468
and he was always bitching
and moaning about it.

43:16.552 --> 43:17.719
Well, one day,
they found him

43:17.804 --> 43:19.680
with his neck broke
and his tongue bit off.

43:19.764 --> 43:21.473
Oh, Jesus.
Yeah.

43:21.933 --> 43:23.684
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

43:26.020 --> 43:28.522
KERSEK: They never could
place Cady near the scene
of the accident,

43:28.606 --> 43:31.858
if you want
to call it that,
at least not out loud.

43:32.735 --> 43:36.238
But the parole board,
they kept him in
for another seven years.

43:36.698 --> 43:39.116
Uh-oh.
The subject is on the move.
Get a good night's sleep.

43:40.034 --> 43:41.994
DANIELLE: Who was that?
Our private eye.

43:42.370 --> 43:43.870
I thought
we were relaxed now.

43:46.541 --> 43:47.833
WOMAN ON PHONE:
New Essex County Hospital.

43:47.917 --> 43:51.253
Yes, room 5036, please.

43:51.337 --> 43:52.379
One minute, please.

43:52.463 --> 43:53.588
All right.

43:54.215 --> 43:55.173
LORI ON PHONE: Hello?

43:55.258 --> 43:56.717
Hi, Lori,
it's me, Sam.

43:56.801 --> 43:59.052
Lori, I just
feel God-awful

43:59.137 --> 44:00.470
you got dragged
into this thing.

44:00.555 --> 44:01.638
It's not your fault.

44:01.723 --> 44:04.433
If I had any idea
that Cady would hurt you

44:04.517 --> 44:06.643
to get at me,
I would have warned you.

44:06.728 --> 44:09.646
Yeah, I know. I know.
I'm glad you called.

44:09.731 --> 44:11.398
Yeah. Yeah, well.

44:11.482 --> 44:13.191
I'm so sorry
about this.

44:13.276 --> 44:14.943
I feel the same way.

44:16.738 --> 44:18.989
So, are you
really determined

44:19.073 --> 44:20.657
about moving back
to Connecticut?

44:20.742 --> 44:22.659
Well, I've thought
about it a lot.

44:22.744 --> 44:25.370
I just think it's
probably the best thing.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.832
I thought that
maybe I could
go back to school.

44:29.625 --> 44:32.210
I'm really going
to miss you, though.

44:32.295 --> 44:34.212
Right.
Excuse me, Lori.

44:34.339 --> 44:36.173
You know,
that sounds real good.
Yeah.

44:36.257 --> 44:38.342
That's gonna work out fine.
I'll get right back to you.

44:38.426 --> 44:40.260
Okay. Bye.
All right, bye.

44:44.557 --> 44:47.517
Well, I just don't know
what I hate more,

44:48.144 --> 44:52.939
that insipid tone
or your stupid,
sophomoric infidelities.

44:53.733 --> 44:55.859
Who was that? Huh?

44:56.444 --> 44:57.527
The girl that
got beat up?

44:57.612 --> 44:58.779
Yes,
it was the girl
that got beat up.

44:58.863 --> 45:00.238
Lori Davis.
I already told you.

45:00.323 --> 45:02.574
She works at
the county courthouse.
She's a clerk.

45:02.992 --> 45:05.410
And what?
You're fucking her?

45:06.954 --> 45:08.789
Interesting choice, Sam.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.707
Calling from
our bedroom phone.

45:10.792 --> 45:12.709
You know, Leigh,
why is it that

45:12.794 --> 45:15.087
whenever I have
a private phone
conversation,

45:15.171 --> 45:18.465
you assume that
I'm fucking someone,
huh? Why is that?

45:18.549 --> 45:20.926
That's why
that psychopath
chose her, right?

45:21.010 --> 45:23.095
Yes, yes, that's why
he chose her.

45:23.179 --> 45:25.263
But I'm not
fucking her
in any way.

45:27.600 --> 45:30.477
Well, you sleazy
son of a bitch!

45:30.561 --> 45:31.895
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

45:31.979 --> 45:33.897
Goddamn you!
You son of a bitch!

45:33.981 --> 45:35.273
Stop it! Leigh!

45:35.733 --> 45:37.734
Dani is
right downstairs.

45:38.861 --> 45:41.196
Oh. Oh, honey,
there's nothing
the matter.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.031
Yeah, I can see, Dad.

45:44.158 --> 45:47.077
LEIGH: I thought
you promised to leave all
that shit behind in Atlanta.

45:47.161 --> 45:48.495
SAM: What shit?

45:49.497 --> 45:50.747
(MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)
(ARGUMENT CONTINUES)

45:54.919 --> 45:56.211
LEIGH: Christ,
what a waste!

45:56.963 --> 45:58.171
The humiliation
we went through

45:58.256 --> 46:00.090
confessing all our
dirty little secrets

46:00.174 --> 46:02.259
in those horrible sessions
with Dr. Hackett.

46:02.343 --> 46:04.594
Yeah. We talked that
one damn incident
to death, didn't we?

46:04.679 --> 46:05.804
Yeah.
Why did you bother?

46:05.888 --> 46:07.222
Because you
asked me to go.

46:07.306 --> 46:08.557
I mean,
why did you bother?

46:08.641 --> 46:10.183
Why did you bother?

46:10.268 --> 46:14.020
Why did you bother
with you and me?
With the marriage?

46:15.648 --> 46:17.983
Uprooting me and Dani?
Moving?

46:18.401 --> 46:19.860
Because that's
what we decided to do!

46:19.986 --> 46:22.070
You said that
you wanted to get out!
You don't get it, do you, Sam?

46:22.155 --> 46:23.280
All right, Leigh.
What is it I don't get?

46:23.364 --> 46:24.489
You just don't get it.

46:24.615 --> 46:26.366
SAM: What...
What don't I get?

46:26.451 --> 46:29.369
LEIGH: Why put us
through all of that!
Why?

46:29.954 --> 46:31.705
Nadine? (SNIFFLING)

46:31.873 --> 46:33.206
It's Dani.

46:34.709 --> 46:35.917
Nothing.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.337
I'm just
losing my mind here.

46:40.756 --> 46:43.091
You don't have
the balls to walk out,

46:43.176 --> 46:44.801
if that's
what you wanted.
Oh, what I wanted?

46:44.886 --> 46:47.429
Like I was going to split,
with you acting
the way you acted.

46:47.513 --> 46:48.889
Acting?
Yeah.

46:48.973 --> 46:52.017
You did some acting.
I don't remember
doing any acting.

46:52.351 --> 46:53.477
Oh, you don't remember
doing any acting?

46:53.561 --> 46:55.270
Well, hey,
let me refresh
your memory.

46:55.354 --> 46:57.522
Do you remember
not taking any work
for three months?

46:57.607 --> 46:59.524
Do you remember that?
You remember not
fixing any meals?

46:59.609 --> 47:01.568
I'm not on
fucking trial here!

47:01.652 --> 47:04.905
Do you remember crying
every goddamn morning,
afternoon, every evening?

47:04.989 --> 47:06.740
Do you remember that?

47:09.827 --> 47:11.453
I scared you, huh?

47:12.747 --> 47:14.748
What did you think, Sam?

47:15.500 --> 47:18.668
What did you think?
You thought maybe I was
going to kill myself?

47:18.753 --> 47:20.420
Over you?
Who else?

47:20.505 --> 47:21.630
You pompous ass.

47:21.714 --> 47:23.465
Oh, God damn it, Leigh,
who knew what
you were gonna do?

47:23.591 --> 47:24.633
You wouldn't
leave the bedroom!

47:24.717 --> 47:26.468
Yeah. I wish you
could say the same.

47:26.552 --> 47:29.429
Now, look, isn't this
what Dr. Hackett
talked about?

47:29.514 --> 47:31.264
Digging up the past.

47:34.101 --> 47:35.435
I mean,
the relevant issue here

47:35.520 --> 47:37.437
is whether I've been
messing around
in New Essex.

47:37.522 --> 47:39.105
And I have not been.

47:39.190 --> 47:42.526
As far as this girl goes,
Lori, she's just a kid.

47:42.610 --> 47:43.985
Well,
that shouldn't stop you.

47:44.403 --> 47:45.570
She's a baby.

47:45.655 --> 47:47.030
I mean, you know
when you gravitate
to people

47:47.114 --> 47:48.198
in the same world
as you...

47:48.282 --> 47:49.866
You gravitate to women.

47:49.951 --> 47:51.284
Oh, come on, Leigh,
for Christ sake,

47:51.369 --> 47:53.453
I'm a lawyer,
she's a clerk.
She looks up to me.

47:53.538 --> 47:56.331
She's just infatuated.
I can't help that.

48:00.503 --> 48:01.711
(SIGHS)

48:01.796 --> 48:03.755
Look, Leigh,
I'm scared.

48:04.465 --> 48:06.800
I think this
whole thing has...

48:08.719 --> 48:12.722
I keep feeling that
there is some animal
out there stalking us.

48:12.807 --> 48:15.767
I think he wants
to hurt us
in the worst way

48:16.811 --> 48:19.437
and that's got me
frightened to death.

48:23.859 --> 48:25.277
You really are scared,
aren't you?

48:25.361 --> 48:26.736
Yeah.

48:26.821 --> 48:28.947
Somebody finally
got to you.

48:30.491 --> 48:32.826
Look, Leigh,
I think...

48:32.910 --> 48:34.953
I think that this guy
beat and raped her

48:35.037 --> 48:38.039
because he knew that
she wouldn't testify,

48:38.124 --> 48:40.667
that she wouldn't
press charges,

48:40.751 --> 48:42.836
because she knows
the system.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.588
I mean,
she works in it.

48:44.672 --> 48:47.090
She knows that
she'd be on trial.

48:49.010 --> 48:52.470
And then, because
she wouldn't testify,
you would assume that

48:52.555 --> 48:55.932
there was something
going on between us

48:56.017 --> 48:57.934
and it would
cause a rift.

49:00.980 --> 49:03.773
That we'd be much more
vulnerable to him.

49:10.323 --> 49:11.740
I'm glad we talked
about this,

49:11.824 --> 49:13.908
because now
we can work together.

49:14.285 --> 49:15.452
We can beat that
son of a bitch,

49:15.536 --> 49:18.872
the two of us together,
working as a team.

49:23.711 --> 49:27.130
Oh, yeah, this is great.
This is something else.

49:27.214 --> 49:28.798
Oh. Oh.

49:29.717 --> 49:30.717
Oh, shit!

49:41.687 --> 49:43.146
Here you go.

49:43.230 --> 49:44.481
I'm sorry,
I haven't ordered yet.

49:44.565 --> 49:47.692
That fellow over there
sent this over,
paid for and all.

49:47.777 --> 49:48.860
Who?

49:49.320 --> 49:50.320
Which one?

49:50.404 --> 49:52.113
That guy who
is just leaving.

49:52.490 --> 49:53.490
(SIGHS)

49:55.743 --> 49:56.785
Excuse me.

49:57.828 --> 49:59.788
Hey. Cady, come here.

50:00.665 --> 50:02.290
Wait up a second.

50:02.541 --> 50:05.835
I've been in
a real bad mood lately.
Shame, ain't it?

50:05.920 --> 50:07.170
You know what you can do
to brighten my mood?

50:08.673 --> 50:10.423
No.
Get the hell
out of here.

50:11.425 --> 50:12.467
I don't mean just
this whole town,

50:12.551 --> 50:14.344
I mean the whole
goddamn state.

50:14.428 --> 50:16.096
I don't want to see you,
I don't want to hear you

50:16.180 --> 50:18.056
and I don't want
to smell you.
Now, leave.

50:18.516 --> 50:20.183
I like...
Are you my friend?

50:20.601 --> 50:21.893
No, I'm not your friend.

50:22.395 --> 50:24.187
Oh. 'Cause I thought
maybe you were my friend

50:24.271 --> 50:26.439
because I like
to plan my comings
and goings with friends.

50:26.524 --> 50:27.691
But if you're
not my friend,

50:27.775 --> 50:28.817
and you're planning
my comings and goings,

50:28.901 --> 50:29.984
I'd call that
presumptuous.

50:30.069 --> 50:32.237
In fact, I'd call it
downright rude,

50:32.321 --> 50:33.947
because I ain't
your porch-baby, buddy.

50:34.198 --> 50:36.825
Gee golly gosh.
I sure am sorry
I offended you,

50:36.909 --> 50:38.785
you white trash
piece of shit.

50:39.078 --> 50:41.746
Ooh-ooh. I got
the all-over fidgets
on that one.

50:41.831 --> 50:44.582
You've really shaken me up.
I'm shivering all over.

50:45.334 --> 50:46.501
Ooh.

50:46.794 --> 50:49.921
It's not necessary to
lay a foul tongue
on me, my friend.

50:50.005 --> 50:53.550
I could get upset.
Things could get
out of hand.

50:53.884 --> 50:56.636
And then, in self-defense,
I could do something to you

50:56.721 --> 50:58.388
that you would not like,
right here.

50:58.472 --> 51:00.515
Anytime you
feel squirrelly,
you just jump.

51:00.599 --> 51:04.519
You threatening me?

51:04.979 --> 51:06.354
You catch on fast.

51:07.064 --> 51:08.398
'Cause I'm well
within my rights

51:08.482 --> 51:09.941
to be here
and you know it.

51:10.025 --> 51:11.818
If I stay here,
what you going to do?

51:11.902 --> 51:14.070
I don't give a rat's ass
about your rights.

51:14.155 --> 51:16.406
You just watch your step,
and you know what
I'm talking about.

51:16.490 --> 51:18.158
What are you gonna do?
Arrest me?

51:18.242 --> 51:20.076
You a cop?
Or were you a cop?

51:20.161 --> 51:22.328
Or were you not good enough
to remain on the force?

51:22.413 --> 51:24.456
'Cause, you know
that's the feeling
I'm getting here.

51:27.168 --> 51:29.502
Hope you enjoyed
your breakfast.

51:38.095 --> 51:39.262
Ma'am,
this belong to you?

51:39.346 --> 51:40.305
LEIGH: Can I help you?

51:40.389 --> 51:41.723
I just found it.

51:42.224 --> 51:44.434
I thought you
might need it back.

51:44.518 --> 51:46.728
Not to frighten you,
but if a dogcatcher

51:46.812 --> 51:48.396
comes across a dog
without a license,

51:48.481 --> 51:49.606
he's liable to
think he's a stray

51:49.690 --> 51:52.317
and do God knows
what to it.

51:52.860 --> 51:56.362
You know,
our dog is...

51:57.448 --> 51:58.615
He passed away.

51:58.699 --> 52:00.033
Oh, what a shame.
Yeah.

52:00.117 --> 52:02.577
Man's best friend and all.
Woman's, too.

52:04.455 --> 52:06.748
Even without
closing my eyes,
I can picture him,

52:06.832 --> 52:10.794
big, friendly, shaggy,
asleep at your feet,

52:10.878 --> 52:12.587
keeping you company
while you're trying

52:12.671 --> 52:15.715
to finish up those
pesky little sketches.

52:18.844 --> 52:21.179
Oh, you're Max Cady,
aren't you?

52:23.516 --> 52:27.227
You know, you better
get the hell out of here
before I call the police.

52:27.311 --> 52:29.020
I'm not doing nothing.

52:29.104 --> 52:30.438
Just giving you back
your dog collar.

52:30.523 --> 52:31.773
I'm not on
your property.

52:31.857 --> 52:33.983
Oh, what'd you
come out here for,
you want to look around?

52:34.068 --> 52:36.152
Go ahead, Mr. Cady,
take a good look.

52:37.071 --> 52:38.238
Nice house.
Yeah.

52:38.322 --> 52:41.241
It is a nice house.
You satisfied
now you've seen it?

52:42.910 --> 52:45.078
Or is there more? Huh?

52:46.163 --> 52:47.539
Is that it?

52:47.623 --> 52:49.999
There is going to
be more, isn't there,
Mr. Cady? Huh?

52:50.084 --> 52:52.460
You won't stop
until you're happy.

52:53.045 --> 52:56.172
How can I be happy, Leigh,
when you're not happy?

52:57.258 --> 52:59.217
You don't know
anything about me.

52:59.301 --> 53:00.510
I know what I see,
ma'am.

53:00.594 --> 53:01.594
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

53:03.764 --> 53:05.473
I wanted to know
what you looked like.

53:05.558 --> 53:07.141
I've been waiting
to see your face,

53:07.226 --> 53:09.060
but you know now
that I see you,

53:10.771 --> 53:12.647
you are just repulsive.

53:13.065 --> 53:14.357
I understand.
Yeah.

53:14.441 --> 53:16.359
I'm not your type.
No.

53:16.443 --> 53:18.695
All that prison time
made me coarse.

53:18.779 --> 53:21.614
Guess I'm covered in
too many tattoos, huh?

53:21.991 --> 53:23.700
But, you see,
there's not a whole
hell of a lot

53:23.784 --> 53:27.245
to do in prison but
desecrate your flesh.

53:27.621 --> 53:29.539
Of course it didn't
have to be that way
for either of us

53:29.623 --> 53:32.333
if your husband
hadn't betrayed us both.

53:33.085 --> 53:35.044
Who knows?
We might have been
different people.

53:35.129 --> 53:37.505
We might have
been happy, Leigh.

I'd catch you here.

Well, that little
smart aleck made me.

54:01.947 --> 54:02.947
He what?

54:03.032 --> 54:04.032
Well, it wasn't
my fault.

54:04.116 --> 54:05.366
He was looking
to be covered.

54:05.451 --> 54:07.201
You're right. There is
a lot of cutsie-cutsie

54:07.286 --> 54:08.369
in that little prick,
isn't there?

54:08.454 --> 54:09.454
Yeah, I told you.

54:09.538 --> 54:10.663
You know
where he was today?

54:10.748 --> 54:13.833
At the public library reading
Thus Spake Zarathustra

54:13.918 --> 54:16.044
by Friedrich Nietzsche,
he's this German philosopher.

54:16.128 --> 54:17.253
He said that
God is dead.

54:17.338 --> 54:18.421
God is dead. Right.

54:18.505 --> 54:20.173
Look, we can keep
going this way,

54:20.257 --> 54:22.383
but it's going to get
awful expensive, Sam.

54:23.928 --> 54:25.637
Well, look, I'm not so
concerned about days.

54:25.721 --> 54:27.513
Just stay on him
a few more nights,
will you?

54:27.598 --> 54:29.682

to resolve this situation?

54:30.559 --> 54:31.893
Yes, I'd love
to resolve it.

54:31.977 --> 54:33.144

a suggestion.

can be hired, by me,

a little hospital job.

talking about here?

I'm a lawyer?

you're going through,
it's okay, go with it.

of the month
comes around,

won't let you
just grow up

or deny it.

and your work.

Okay. I mean...

think about all that.

57:26.360 --> 57:33.366
You've got to be
a do-right-all-night man

57:35.452 --> 57:36.702
Man
(DANIELLE GIGGLES)

57:37.287 --> 57:41.457
Now, you can trust in me,
because I'm a do-right man,
okay?

57:43.836 --> 57:45.211
Okay, 'night now.

57:45.963 --> 57:48.172
Okay. Good night.

57:52.803 --> 57:54.971
You know, honey,
I think maybe
I should walk you in.

57:55.055 --> 57:58.641
No, it's okay, Mom.
There's a lot
of people here.

57:58.725 --> 58:00.810
I'll be right here
at 4:00 to pick you up.

58:00.894 --> 58:02.854
Okay. Bye.
Bye.

58:04.898 --> 58:07.859
I didn't think
summer session was
gonna be so crowded.

58:07.943 --> 58:09.485
It's not.
They're just having
a big meeting

58:09.570 --> 58:11.946
about next fall's
chorus program.

58:12.030 --> 58:13.990
I have to go downstairs
for Drama. Bye.

58:14.074 --> 58:15.408
Okay, bye.

58:16.118 --> 58:17.702
(BELL RINGING)

59:01.288 --> 59:02.455
Hello.

59:07.044 --> 59:08.252
Nadine?

59:21.975 --> 59:25.436
I'm here for
the Drama class.

59:31.777 --> 59:32.777
Hi.

59:33.320 --> 59:34.654
Oops.

59:34.905 --> 59:36.405
Am I busted?

59:36.490 --> 59:38.115
No.
I hope not.

59:38.533 --> 59:41.244
You can't smoke grass
in school.

59:41.328 --> 59:43.496
Privilege of
the profession.

59:44.665 --> 59:47.375
Eases inhibitions.
You down here for Drama?

59:47.459 --> 59:48.542
Yeah.

59:48.835 --> 59:51.170
Are you
the Drama teacher?

59:51.255 --> 59:53.089
And you're,
let me guess.

59:56.426 --> 59:57.510
Cecile James?

59:58.011 --> 01:00:01.597
No, I'm Danielle Bowden.

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:04.350
Danielle.
Oh, we spoke last night.

01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:05.851
Yeah.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.188
Oh, I'm sorry.
How rude.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:11.649
It's okay.

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.234
Um...

01:00:16.989 --> 01:00:18.990
(SINGING) I think
we're alone now...

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:20.491
(CHUCKLES)

01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:24.578
Okay.

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:32.712
(EXHALES)

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.926
Thanks. Here.

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:41.804
I'm going to
give this to you.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:44.265
Ow. (LAUGHS)

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:48.311
Little trick I learned.
Take it.

01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:53.649
You know when we spoke
on the phone last night?

01:00:53.734 --> 01:00:54.942
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:59.071
You really
made sense to me

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:01.824
and I thought a lot.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.160
Those are human truths,
darling.

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:05.411
That's what
it's all about.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.788
And that's what
we deal with here.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.583
See the book you have,
Thomas Wolfe?

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:14.211
It's all about
self-discovery,
the inner voyage.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.757
I like the end

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:24.263
where Eugene's journey...
It was really mystical,
you know,

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:28.059
and it was almost
like a pilgrimage.

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:31.020
Almost like a cop-out,
if you ask me.

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:34.190
Although those were
the facts of Wolfe's life.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:37.860
The novel is
what you would call
a roman Ã  clef.

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:39.820
You know what that is?
(SIGHS)

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:42.615
Sure.

01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:45.034
Well, nonetheless,
you can't escape

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.911
your demons just
by leaving home.

01:01:47.788 --> 01:01:50.998
Although writers
do find new freedom
when they relocate abroad.

01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:54.043
Take Henry Miller.
Have you read
his trilogy?

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:55.628
Plexus, Nexus
and Sexus?

01:01:57.089 --> 01:01:59.256
No. No.
You haven't
read that?

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.842
You're missing
something.

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:06.639
Well, you know what?
I did read
Tropic of Cancer.

01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:09.225
Just parts of it,
though,

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:13.145
because I had to
sneak it off my parents'
shelf, you know?

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:18.317
But his descriptions
are pretty vivid,
I would say.

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.445
In one of the novels,
I don't recall which,

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:24.365
he describes an erection
as a piece of lead
with wings on it.

01:02:25.534 --> 01:02:27.159
I didn't read
that part.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.994
Of course not.
You're not allowed.

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:31.122
Your parents
don't want you to
achieve adulthood.

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:32.248
That's natural.

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:35.501
They know the pitfalls
of adulthood,
all that freedom.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.628
They know it
only too well.

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:41.382
Temptation to stray,
deflecting their guilt
and anger onto you

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:44.927
for a crime that's
not even a crime,
for smoking grass.

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:52.184
Wait a second.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:54.937
Where are you from?

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:57.648
Where am I from?

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.525
Yeah.
Where do you think
I'm from?

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:02.111
I don't know, but...

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:04.488
If I told you,
you going to
get mad at me?

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:06.031
No.

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:14.373
I'm from
the black forest.

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:19.545
That's funny.

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:23.757
You're not
the Drama teacher,
are you?

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:26.552
Maybe I'm
the big bad wolf.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.680
Umm...

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:34.894
So you're that guy
that's been hanging
around the house?

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:38.272
You're the one that
killed my mom's dog?

01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:40.733
Your mom's dog
was killed?

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:41.984
Yeah.

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:45.321
I didn't even know
anything about that.

01:03:45.405 --> 01:03:46.906
That's a shame.

01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:48.782
That's a damn shame.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.160
Yes, it was.

01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:53.412
What kind
of dog was it?

01:03:54.206 --> 01:03:56.499
I don't know.
He was just...

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:58.792
He was fluffy, and...

01:04:00.212 --> 01:04:01.420
Fluffy?

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:03.881
Mmm-hmm.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:08.093
So you didn't do that?

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:10.262
Of course
I didn't do that.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:16.393
Okay.

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:17.770
I wouldn't do that.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:21.357
So why... What are
you doing here, then?

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:24.860
Well, I came to meet you,
to be honest with you.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:29.782
Why? I mean...

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:30.866
Because

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:35.871
I wanted to meet you,
see what you're like.

01:04:35.956 --> 01:04:38.958
I see you're
a nice person.
That's all.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:43.963
You're not going
to hurt me, are you?

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:46.048
I'm not going to
hurt you at all.

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:48.217
There's no
hurting here, Danielle.

01:04:49.678 --> 01:04:51.929
Between us,
there's no anger,
nothing.

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:54.014
Just a search
for truth.

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:58.227
I mean, did you judge me,
did you get angry at me

01:04:58.311 --> 01:04:59.979
when you caught me
smoking the grass?

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:01.188
Hmm?

01:05:01.273 --> 01:05:02.356
No.

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:05.734
But your parents,
they judged you.

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:07.945
They got plenty angry
at you, didn't they?

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:09.238
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:12.283
They punished you
for their sins.

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:14.743
What did they do?

01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:15.995
They...

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:20.416
My dad...
They just yelled
a whole lot

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.127
and my mom cried

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:26.755
and my dad said
I couldn't drive
the Cherokee.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.216
I would say
they punished you
for their sins,

01:05:29.301 --> 01:05:30.634
and you resent that,

01:05:30.719 --> 01:05:32.720
and you should
resent it.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:36.849
But Professor do-right has
a little advice for you.

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:38.767
You shouldn't
damn them.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:40.603
Don't judge them.
Just forgive them,

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:42.730
for they know not
what they do.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:45.774
Oh...
Um...

01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:47.109
Why do you
hate my father?

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:50.863
I don't hate him at all.
Oh, no. I pray for him.

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:53.324
I'm here to help him.

01:05:53.742 --> 01:05:56.785
I mean, we all
make mistakes,
Danielle.

01:05:57.412 --> 01:06:00.164
You and I have.
But at least we try
to admit it.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.874
Don't we?

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:03.459
Yeah.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.753
But your daddy,
he don't.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:11.133
Every man carries
a circle of hell around
his head like a halo.

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:12.384
Your daddy, too.

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:17.473
Every man, every man
has to go through hell
to reach his paradise.

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:20.267
You know
what paradise is?

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.519
No.
Salvation.

01:06:24.064 --> 01:06:26.065
'Cause your daddy's
not happy.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:27.566
Your mommy's
not happy.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:31.320
And you know what?
You're not happy.

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:33.989
Are you?

01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:35.199
No, I'm not.

01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:42.039
You thought about me
last night, didn't you?

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:43.415
(LAUGHS)

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:46.460
Um...

01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:48.712
Yes, I did.

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:50.756
I know.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:56.720
You know, I think
I might have
found a companion,

01:06:58.056 --> 01:07:00.974
a companion for
that long walk
to the light.

01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:06.480
Do you mind if
I put my arm
around you?

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.027
Um...

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:21.328
It's okay.

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:25.124
No, I don't mind.

01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:27.459
Okay.

01:07:41.433 --> 01:07:42.725
(GIGGLES)

01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:42.283
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:57.633
Kersek, where the hell
have you been,
for Christ sake?

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.134
He came at my daughter
at school.

01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:00.260
You asked me to
watch him nights.

01:09:00.345 --> 01:09:02.513
I'm watching him nights.
What happened?

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:05.140
My wife, Leigh,
she found some marijuana

01:09:05.225 --> 01:09:06.558
in one of
Dani's schoolbooks.

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:09.478
We don't know if Cady
gave it to her or
exactly what happened,

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.313
but she's scared and
she won't talk about it.

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:13.732
But now this has
gone far enough.
It's got to stop!

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:14.817
You phone the cops?

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:16.401
No, I didn't
phone the cops.

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:17.653
I mean, what did
you call them?

01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:19.654
You call them "Slow,
skeptical, pathetic, even."

01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:21.573
Dani.
No, Leigh,
that's all right.

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:23.533
Just hold on a minute.

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:28.622
Kersek, look,
I want to hire
those three guys,

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:30.290
you remember,
the hospital job.

01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:33.085
Consider it done,
the sooner the better.

01:09:33.877 --> 01:09:35.546
Three men's going
to cost you a grand.

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:36.796
Now I know that's
not chicken feed,

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.381
but you don't wanna go
with less than three.

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:40.509
It's better to
overdo it.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.386
Okay.
You'll have the money
in the morning.

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:44.179
All right.
Then we'll be on
for tomorrow night.

01:09:44.264 --> 01:09:47.515
And Sam,
you'll feel good
about this.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.395
All right.

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:07.870
Do you notice
these young people?

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:09.454
They don't
look very happy.

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:12.165
They're committed
to their professions
and to their ambitions,

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:13.709
but they're not
committed to each other.

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:15.794
Cady, shut up
and listen.

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.047
If you don't leave...

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:21.383
If you don't
leave my family alone

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.594
and if you don't
get out of here,

01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:26.805
you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:29.766
Could you repeat that?

01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:30.893
I said,

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:33.145
if you don't
get out of here,

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:35.606
you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

01:10:36.316 --> 01:10:37.900
A threat?
Yeah.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:39.735
You bet your ass
that's a threat.

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:41.778
Well,
I have thought
of relocating

01:10:41.863 --> 01:10:44.907
somewhere where I'd
be more appreciated,
California, perhaps.

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:47.659
I could teach
earthquake preparedness.

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:51.705
But then it hits me,
I love New Essex,
Counselor.

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:55.083
I mean,
where else could
I just casually confer

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:56.335
with an old colleague?

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:59.796
We're not colleagues.
Do you understand that?
We're not colleagues.

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:01.006
Still think you're
better than me.

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:02.382
No, I don't think
I'm better than you.

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:03.926
That's not
the goddamned point.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:05.886
Good. 'Cause if
you're not better than me,

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:07.679
then I can have
what you have.

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:09.514
What do I have?

01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:11.642
A wife, a daughter.

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:17.189
I'm going to teach you
the meaning of commitment.

01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:19.650
Fourteen years ago,
I was forced to make

01:11:19.734 --> 01:11:21.568
a commitment to
an eight-by-nine cell

01:11:21.653 --> 01:11:24.696
and now you're
going to be forced
to make a commitment.

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:27.240
You could say I'm here
to save you.

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:31.620
Fine.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:34.873
Check out the Bible,
Counselor,

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:36.750
the book between
Esther and Psalms.

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:45.550
Dani? Dani?

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:49.513
You all right?

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:51.807
What?
Is everything
all right?

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:52.975
Yeah.

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:58.438
This isn't going
to work, you know.

01:11:58.523 --> 01:11:59.982
What isn't going
to work?

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.734
Locking us in,
hiding us from the world.

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:04.736
Oh, don't be
so dramatic, Dani.

01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:06.655
Making me stay out
of school.

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:08.657
You're going back
to school tomorrow.

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:09.866
And put
some clothes on.

01:12:09.951 --> 01:12:11.451
You're not
a little kid anymore.

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:14.204
Yeah? Then why
am I going back
to school tomorrow?

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:15.539
What are you
going to do?

01:12:15.623 --> 01:12:18.083
That's none of
your concern, Dani.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:24.756
Dad, he didn't
force himself
on me, you know.

01:12:25.717 --> 01:12:27.592
I know you'd like
to think that he did.

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:30.637
But I think he was...

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:34.975
I think he was
just trying to make
a connection with me.

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:36.309
You know?
Now, Dani,

01:12:36.978 --> 01:12:38.437
I want you to
listen to me.

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:41.106
All right? No.
Do you understand?

01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:45.485
No. There will never
be any connection

01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:48.572
between you
and Max Cady.

01:12:50.158 --> 01:12:51.950
You understand that?

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:02.794
Did he touch you?

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:04.463
(CHUCKLES)

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:09.551
What are you
laughing about?
Why are you smiling?

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:12.262
I'm asking you a question.
Did he touch you?

01:13:13.514 --> 01:13:15.307
Dani, wipe that
smile off your face!

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.768
I'm asking you,
did he touch you?

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.777
No, no, no, wait, Dani.
I'm sorry.

01:13:27.487 --> 01:13:28.987
No, I'm sorry.

01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:31.948
Wait, honey.
I'm sorry.

01:13:32.033 --> 01:13:34.534
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:40.957
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:13:58.142 --> 01:13:59.309
THUG: Max?

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:01.186
(GRUNTING)

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:43.603
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:14:43.729 --> 01:14:45.021
Come on.

01:14:46.357 --> 01:14:47.691
(GRUNTING)

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.669
(CLATTERING)

01:15:13.885 --> 01:15:19.264
Counselor?

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:21.516
Is that you?

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:24.352
Counselor?

01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:28.315
(SINGSONG VOICE)
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:44.831
I ain't no white trash
piece of shit.

01:15:44.916 --> 01:15:46.875
I'm better
than you all.

01:15:49.795 --> 01:15:51.546
I can out-learn you.

01:15:53.007 --> 01:15:54.966
I can out-read you.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:59.763
I can outthink you,
and I can
out-philosophize you.

01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:02.390
And I'm going
to outlast you.

01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:03.850
You think
a couple of whacks

01:16:03.935 --> 01:16:06.603
to my good-old-boy gut's
gonna get me down?

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:09.397
It's going to
take a hell of a lot more
than that, Counselor,

01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:11.733
to prove you're
better than me!

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:18.281
"I am like God,
and God like me.

01:16:18.366 --> 01:16:21.076
"I am as large as God.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.162
"He is as small as I.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:28.583
"He cannot above me
nor I beneath him be."

01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:33.755
Silesius,
17th century.

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:43.348
Counselor?

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:51.022
Could you be there?

01:16:52.066 --> 01:16:53.316
(WHISTLES)

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:55.568
(WHISTLES AGAIN)

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:57.779
Counselor?

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:07.455
I wonder
if you're here.

01:17:17.008 --> 01:17:18.216
Fuck it.

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:22.679
If you're here,
what the fuck's
the difference?

01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:24.848
Fuck it!

01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:36.443
WOMAN: I've got
Mr. Kersek on one.

01:17:36.527 --> 01:17:37.736
SAM: Good.
I'll take it.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:38.903
Tom.

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:41.531
Sam, you look tired.
You get that writ?

01:17:41.615 --> 01:17:44.993
No, no, we got to
get into that.
Let me just grab this.

01:17:45.077 --> 01:17:46.870
Kersek.
Look, I'm damn sorry
about last night.

01:17:46.954 --> 01:17:48.038
That son of a bitch
could survive

01:17:48.122 --> 01:17:49.247
a preemptive
nuclear strike.

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:50.623
All right.
Hang on a second.
Hang on a second.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:53.251
Tom, I'm not doing it.
I pulled a fast one

01:17:53.336 --> 01:17:55.920
and it's come back and
it's bit me on the ass
in a major way.

01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:57.047
What you did was dumb.

01:17:57.131 --> 01:18:00.258
What I'm asking here
is no big deal, Sam.
This is my daughter!

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:02.010
No, Tom, it's perjury
and it's bullshit

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:03.553
and I'm not doing it!
Now, excuse me.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:05.764
All right?
All right.
I'll be in my office.

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:08.099
Tom, who was that
top criminal lawyer?

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:09.934
Lee Heller.
Kersek.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:11.186
We need to talk.
KERSEK: Trouble is

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:13.563
if word gets out
how Cady bushwhacked
those poor bastards,

01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:15.190
it's gonna be
a bitch to line up
three new guys.

01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:17.776
I don't want three new guys.
No more guys, you hear me?

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.652
Mr. Heller,
it's Sam Bowden

01:18:19.737 --> 01:18:21.446
from Broadbent
and Denmeyer.

01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:23.656
Tom speaks
very highly of you.

01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:24.991
In fact,
he says you're the best,

01:18:25.076 --> 01:18:26.284
and the best is
what I need right now.

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:28.620
HELLER: (ON PHONE)
We froze our butts
together in Korea.

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:30.038
How can I help you,
Sam?

01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:32.874
Well, it's a simple petition
for a restraining order,

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:34.751
but there's been
some complications.

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:36.211
Now,
I know this is
short notice,

01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:38.213
but look,
I need this injunction.

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:40.882
You see,
there's an ex-convict
by the name of Max Cady,

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:42.008
he's been
harassing my family.

01:18:42.093 --> 01:18:45.637
I'm sorry, Mr. Bowden.
I can't continue
this conversation.

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:47.430
Well, is there
a more convenient time?

01:18:47.515 --> 01:18:50.100
No, no. The damn thing
is I have a conflict.

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:51.976
Now, what would
that be?
Well, you see,

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:54.896
Mr. Cady retained
my services
as of yesterday.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.022
He what?

01:18:56.107 --> 01:18:58.024
In fact,
I see on my phone sheet

01:18:58.109 --> 01:18:59.651
Mr. Cady called
this morning,

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:00.819
so I'm sure
he'll fill me in...

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:04.531
But wait a minute, Lee.
Now, look, this man
is a psychotic.

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:08.159
It appears
I'll be seeing you at
that hearing after all.

01:19:09.954 --> 01:19:11.162
CADY ON TAPE:
Could you repeat that?

01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:13.415
SAM ON TAPE: I said
if you don't leave...

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:16.251
If you don't
leave my family alone

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:18.503
and if you don't
get out of here,

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:21.673
you're gonna be hurting
like you never dreamed.

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:23.633
A threat?

01:19:23.717 --> 01:19:26.136
Yeah, you bet your ass
that's a threat.

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:31.433
HELLER:
You need only glance
at my client to know

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:34.477
that Mr. Bowden
made good

01:19:34.562 --> 01:19:37.897
on his heinous
and cowardly threat.

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:40.775
Just as God arose
to judgment

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:42.652
to save all the meek
of the earth,

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:45.655
I hope and pray
you will do
the same, sir.

01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:47.323
Your Honor,
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:19:48.075 --> 01:19:51.286
Mr. Cady wouldn't
have surreptitiously
taped our meeting

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:53.496
unless he knew
that he'd...

01:19:55.166 --> 01:19:59.043
This court
does not condone

01:20:00.004 --> 01:20:04.048
feuds, vendettas
or vigilantism.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:09.429
Let me quote our
great Negro educator,
Mr. Booker T. Washington.

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:14.476
"I will let no man
drag me down so low

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:18.062
"as to make me
hate him."

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:19.230
Yes.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:22.734
I will grant
the restraining order

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:26.321
not to validate
the malice between you,

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:31.493
but in the interest
of Christian harmony.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:36.164
You may not come
within 500 yards

01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:40.835
of Mr. Maximilian Cady

01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:46.341
until such time
as the court may
lift the injunction.

01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:51.930
King Solomon could
not have adjudicated
more wisely, Your Honor.

01:20:52.723 --> 01:20:57.393
I am so offended by
the philistine tactics
of Mr. Bowden,

01:20:57.478 --> 01:21:01.689
I petitioned the A. B.A.
For his disbarment

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:04.192
on the grounds of
moral turpitude.

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:07.529
Now, if you will
excuse us, my client...

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:08.613
Come on, son...

01:21:08.739 --> 01:21:10.448
Is due back
at the hospital

01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:17.497
for the results of
his numerous X-rays.

01:21:20.084 --> 01:21:21.209
Kersek, I want a gun.

01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:22.877
I need a gun.
I want a gun.

01:21:22.962 --> 01:21:24.128
You want a gun?

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:25.296
Yeah, I need a gun.

01:21:25.965 --> 01:21:27.048
Know anything
about guns?
No.

01:21:27.132 --> 01:21:28.216
No, I don't believe
in them.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.759
I never had them
around the house
or anything.

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:30.885
All right,
I'll get you a gun.

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:32.387
What kind of
gun you want?
Now, calm down.

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:34.472
Well, just something simple,
something I can handle.

01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:37.559
Let me see
what fits you. A.45...

01:21:37.643 --> 01:21:38.935
Let me see your hands.
Okay.

01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:43.064
A.38 snub-nosed
special. Yeah.
All right. Good.

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:45.400
That'll do. I can even
teach you how to use it.

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:47.360
All right. Great.
The first lesson
is this.

01:21:47.861 --> 01:21:50.238
Don't think of it
as shooting a man
or trying to kill him.

01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:52.407
Right.
Think of it as
an extension of your fist.

01:21:52.491 --> 01:21:54.492
You're just reaching out
and knocking the man down.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.160
All right.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:58.371
Later on we can
go out to the woods
and shoot some trees, okay?

01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:01.124
That'd be great.
That'd be great. Good.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:05.003
What is it? What?

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.921
Well, Sam...
Yeah?

01:22:07.006 --> 01:22:09.465
I give you a gun.
You pull it on Cady,

01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:10.592
and it's gonna
dawn on you

01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:11.676
that shooting a man
is different

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.553
than blowing holes
in some tree.

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:15.847
Next thing, you know,
you don't have my gun,
Cady does.

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:17.390
No, no, no.
You're gonna teach me.

01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:18.891
I know how
to handle a gun.

01:22:18.976 --> 01:22:20.101
He won't take it
away from me.

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:23.146
Best-case scenario,
you kill Cady dog-dead.

01:22:24.148 --> 01:22:27.525
Fifteen years to life.
Do you realize that,
Counselor?

01:22:33.324 --> 01:22:36.200
Oh, Jesus!
It's all fucked up,
Kersek!

01:22:37.077 --> 01:22:38.328
I mean,
the law considers me

01:22:38.412 --> 01:22:40.246
more of a loose cannon
than Max Cady!

01:22:40.331 --> 01:22:42.624
Some big-shit attorney
has whipped

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:44.959
the A. B.A.'s
ethics committee
into a frenzy.

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:48.296
There's an emergency session
in Raleigh over the assault.

01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:50.381
How did they link that
to you?

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:54.677
I went to warn Cady.
I thought it was
the decent thing to do.

01:22:54.762 --> 01:22:57.722
Maybe I'd scare him.
And he was wired.

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:02.310
Goddamn fools.

01:23:05.773 --> 01:23:07.649
This hearing,
it's real important?

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:09.233
(LAUGHS)

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:13.404
Only if I want to continue
to practice law. Yeah.

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:15.573
Cady isn't
expected there, is he?

01:23:16.075 --> 01:23:19.369
Oh, no, no, no.
Mr. Cady,
he's beyond reproach.

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:21.162
But you're required
to be there.
Yeah.

01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:23.498
When is this hearing?

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:25.667
It's Thursday morning,
9:00.

01:23:25.751 --> 01:23:28.503
The torture begins
and lasts for two days.

01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:31.005
You have to fly up
the night before?

01:23:31.965 --> 01:23:33.132
Right.

01:23:34.051 --> 01:23:35.843
Cady's an opportunist.

01:23:35.928 --> 01:23:37.887
If he thinks
you're gonna be out
of town for two days,

01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:40.682
that's going to be
as tempting to him
as shit is to a fly.

01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:43.017
If Cady breaks
into your home,

01:23:43.102 --> 01:23:44.811
he can be killed.

01:23:44.895 --> 01:23:46.270
Justifiably.

01:23:48.315 --> 01:23:51.067
But he won't show
unless he's real sure
you're not gonna be there.

01:24:29.148 --> 01:24:30.481
(SWITCHING STATIONS)

01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:34.110
(CHOIR SINGING)

01:25:00.304 --> 01:25:01.304
Have a good trip.

01:25:01.388 --> 01:25:03.097
All right. Bye-bye.

01:25:03.182 --> 01:25:04.182
Call us tonight, okay?

01:25:04.266 --> 01:25:05.600
All right.

01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:17.612
I didn't miss
the 9:20 to Raleigh?

01:25:17.696 --> 01:25:19.989
I'm afraid you did, sir.
But there's a 10:20.

01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:21.157
Oh, it's not that.

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:24.202
I just have some very,
very important papers
for Samuel Bowden.

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:25.953
Was he on the 9:20?

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:28.581
We can't give out
that information, sir.

01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:30.875
Well, it's just...

01:25:31.668 --> 01:25:33.544
I guess I could send it
to him overnight,

01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:37.381
but he might be back,
for all I know,
tomorrow morning, and I...

01:25:38.717 --> 01:25:40.051
See, I...

01:25:40.427 --> 01:25:43.721
My wife and I have
been in an accident,
and he's our lawyer.

01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:47.975
And if I don't get
in touch with him,
we could lose this case.

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:50.978
We've already lost
our little daughter, Dani.

01:25:52.231 --> 01:25:53.356
Is...

01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:56.234
Is there any way
I can find out

01:25:56.318 --> 01:25:59.028
if he was on that flight
and when he's coming back?

01:25:59.112 --> 01:26:01.239
It'd really,
really help us.

01:26:03.826 --> 01:26:04.909
(KEYS CLATTERING)

01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:13.334
He'll be back the day
after tomorrow, sir.

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:15.711
Bless your heart.

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:32.520
(SOFTLY)
Go on. Go on in.

01:26:35.274 --> 01:26:36.774
Get down, Sam.

01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:44.407
(BANGING ON DOOR)
Leigh. Leigh,
give me a cigarette.

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:46.951
You better
slow down, Sam.

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:48.995
You're outpacing me
two-to-one since
you started smoking.

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:51.706
Just keep track of
how many I owe you.

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:54.750
So, how'd it go
at the airport?

01:26:54.835 --> 01:26:56.043
Well, we did our thing,

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:57.461
but we don't know
if he saw us,

01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:59.589
we don't even know
if he was there.

01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:02.133
Set the trap
and we'll see.

01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:03.843
What if we don't
want to see?

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:05.595
Dani!
DANIELLE: What?

01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:07.763
Maybe he
poisoned the dog.

01:27:08.098 --> 01:27:10.057
Dani...
Sam, watch out
for the windows.

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:13.144
Yeah, you're not
allowed to stand up,
Dad, remember?

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:20.902
Didn't Cady
go after her?

01:27:20.986 --> 01:27:22.153
LEIGH:
You don't know Dani.

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:24.238
If she finds
a palmetto bug
in her bedroom,

01:27:24.323 --> 01:27:26.073
she takes it outside.

01:27:26.158 --> 01:27:28.534
You know, she could
never kill anything.

01:27:28.619 --> 01:27:30.077
Even a six-foot
palmetto bug?

01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:31.495
(LAUGHS)

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:34.498
Oh, God.

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:44.342
What is that?

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:49.055
It's a monofilament line.
I got it from
Sam's fishing gear.

01:27:49.139 --> 01:27:51.807
See, what I do is
I stretch it across
the windows and the doors

01:27:51.892 --> 01:27:53.893
and tie it to
Dani's teddy bear here.

01:27:53.977 --> 01:27:55.561
If the bear moves
a quarter of an inch,

01:27:55.646 --> 01:27:57.188
I'll know
if the holy ghost
is sneaking in.

01:28:29.388 --> 01:28:31.180
What are you reading?

01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:36.435
Why? Did Kersek quit?

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.603
No.

01:28:38.647 --> 01:28:40.481
It's just
that Cady said...

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:42.400
You want some answers.

01:28:43.902 --> 01:28:45.111
Me, too.

01:28:47.406 --> 01:28:52.284
I'd like to know just
how strong we are
or how weak.

01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:56.706
But I guess
the only way we're going
to find that out

01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:59.959
is just by
going through this.

01:29:03.797 --> 01:29:07.591
It's just that Cady said
to read the book between
Esther and Psalms.

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:10.136
Which is which one?

01:29:10.637 --> 01:29:12.263
The Book of Job.

01:29:15.434 --> 01:29:18.269
Job was a good man.
He believed in God

01:29:19.396 --> 01:29:21.397
and God tested
his faith.

01:29:21.815 --> 01:29:24.108
He took away
everything he had,

01:29:25.736 --> 01:29:27.486
even his children.

01:29:31.283 --> 01:29:32.575
(GASPS)

01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:46.714
DANIELLE:
It's hideous, this plan.
I mean, barbaric.

01:29:46.798 --> 01:29:50.301
They're crazy.
My dad's turned
into some kind of...

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:51.552
I don't know what.

01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:52.928
Barbaric.

01:29:53.013 --> 01:29:54.889
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

01:29:56.308 --> 01:30:00.561
Listen to your father.
Do what they say.
What else you can do?

01:30:00.645 --> 01:30:03.606
Leave. We could go
to the houseboat,
you know,

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:05.733
and get lost
in any inlet.

01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:11.989
Dani, come on.

01:30:12.491 --> 01:30:14.200
Don't stay outside.

01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:25.336
You wanna know what
really disturbs me?
It's killing this guy.

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:28.798
I mean,
taking a man's life.

01:30:30.717 --> 01:30:33.344
I don't know if
I can live with that.

01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:35.554
You may have to.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:37.723
Sam, just remember
the plan.
I know the plan.

01:30:38.683 --> 01:30:41.185
Damn, it's premeditated.
It's...

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:44.855
It makes me an accomplice,
an accessory, an abettor.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.233
It's also excessive force.

01:30:47.609 --> 01:30:50.111
Sam,
the only thing excessive
we could do to Cady

01:30:50.195 --> 01:30:53.114
would be to gut him
and eat his liver.

01:30:53.198 --> 01:30:54.323
That might
be excessive.

01:30:54.407 --> 01:30:56.659
Jesus Christ,
Kersek, I'm serious.

01:30:56.743 --> 01:30:58.953
No, you're scared.

01:30:59.496 --> 01:31:02.998
But that's okay.
I want you to
savor that fear.

01:31:03.708 --> 01:31:05.918
You know,
the South evolved in fear.

01:31:06.002 --> 01:31:10.214
Fear of the Indian,
fear of the slave,
fear of the damn Union.

01:31:11.466 --> 01:31:14.552
The South has
a fine tradition
of savoring fear.

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:25.146
(INAUDIBLE)

01:31:32.195 --> 01:31:33.863
SAM: What's the matter?

01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:36.532
Don't look over!
Don't look.

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:38.868
(WHISPERING)
She's making me nervous.

01:31:40.245 --> 01:31:41.829
What would
she normally do

01:31:41.913 --> 01:31:43.664
if Sam wasn't around
to run her home?

01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:45.416
She'd stay...
SAM: She'd stay over.

01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:48.335
Well, then,
she stays over.

01:32:36.092 --> 01:32:37.509

01:34:24.576 --> 01:34:26.076
What?
Leigh.

01:34:26.578 --> 01:34:28.537
I know how
the dog died.

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:31.373
Sam, are you dreaming?
No. No.

01:34:31.458 --> 01:34:32.875
I just had
the weirdest feeling

01:34:32.959 --> 01:34:35.210
he was already
in the house.

01:34:50.226 --> 01:34:52.269

huh, Miss Graciela?

01:34:52.354 --> 01:34:53.604
Yeah. It's hot.

(SIGHS)

01:34:55.315 --> 01:34:57.316
You know,
I think it's the humidity

01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:59.318
that makes us all
so thirsty.

01:34:59.903 --> 01:35:02.237
(BURPS) Excuse me.

01:35:03.490 --> 01:35:05.157
My pop was a cop.

Twenty years.

when he was on a stakeout.

I learned that
in prison. You like?

01:35:32.811 --> 01:35:34.561
White trash
piece of shit.

Kersek?

01:36:07.804 --> 01:36:10.722
Dani, Dani,
go back to your room.
Go back to your room.

01:36:10.807 --> 01:36:12.349
Lock the door.

(WHISPERS) Don't go
down there, Sam.

SAM: Now, listen,
I've got Kersek's
gun with me

01:38:32.574 --> 01:38:36.368
and you're gonna
find the piano wire that
Cady used in the house.

01:38:36.452 --> 01:38:38.579
Yeah, I know
how this looks.
I know it.

01:38:38.663 --> 01:38:41.290
You're not supposed
to flee a murder scene.

01:38:41.374 --> 01:38:43.959
Listen, Lieutenant, now,
you may know this
and you may not,

01:38:44.043 --> 01:38:46.837
but in the law,
there's a thing
called force majeure.

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:49.423
It means
an unforeseeable act of God

01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:52.217
and it cancels
all promises
and obligations.

01:38:52.302 --> 01:38:54.678
So, legally speaking,
all bets are off.

01:38:55.054 --> 01:38:58.181
You find Max Cady
and we'll come back.

01:39:00.852 --> 01:39:01.893
What did he say?

01:39:01.978 --> 01:39:03.061
He said we're fugitives.

What's that mean?

01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:05.981

for you.

something straight here.

an eight-by-nine cell

who were less than human.

in that time

was to become
more than human.

Please don't
take umbrage,

but in the plan
that I have formulated,

01:48:40.514 --> 01:48:43.975
there's much more to it
than just you and
I just making love.

01:48:44.226 --> 01:48:48.229
I mean, that's just
so commonplace
and dreary.

01:48:50.774 --> 01:48:52.442
Here and now,
we have an opportunity.

01:48:52.985 --> 01:48:54.819
"What is that opportunity?"
You ask.

01:48:54.904 --> 01:48:57.197
Why, here and now,
we have an opportunity

01:48:57.281 --> 01:49:00.283
to depict
and dramatize...

and the depths

Listen to me, Max.
Listen to me.

You know, Max,
since all this started,

01:49:38.989 --> 01:49:40.615
I've thought
about you all the time.

01:49:40.991 --> 01:49:46.287
I've tried to imagine
what it must have
been like for you

01:49:46.372 --> 01:49:48.081
all those years,
locked up in jail.

01:49:48.749 --> 01:49:53.795
I've tried
to imagine you
and even your crimes

01:49:53.879 --> 01:49:57.298
and how you must have felt
in those moments
that you did them.

01:49:58.425 --> 01:50:02.136
See, I know
about loss, Max.

01:50:02.221 --> 01:50:06.849
I know about losing time,
even losing years.

01:50:07.685 --> 01:50:11.104
And I know it
doesn't compare to jail,

01:50:11.188 --> 01:50:16.567
but I can understand
and I could
share this with you.

01:50:17.236 --> 01:50:21.572
Because of that,
whatever it is
that you've got planned,

01:50:22.366 --> 01:50:24.701
I want you to do
it just with me,

01:50:26.245 --> 01:50:27.745
not with her,

01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:33.376

this connection.

01:50:49.184 --> 01:50:50.226

(SCREAMS)

01:53:14.997 --> 01:53:18.040
How can he answer
when you're hitting him
like that?

01:53:18.125 --> 01:53:19.709
Because he's
perjuring himself,
Your Honor.

01:53:19.793 --> 01:53:21.669
He knows damn well
exactly what it said.

01:53:21.753 --> 01:53:22.795
Don't you?

01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:24.672
It said that
she was promiscuous.

01:53:24.756 --> 01:53:27.216
It said that she had
three different lovers
in one month.

01:53:27.301 --> 01:53:29.135
At least three!
At least three!

01:53:29.219 --> 01:53:31.554
And did you show
this report to the D. A?

01:53:31.805 --> 01:53:33.014
No, no!

01:53:35.934 --> 01:53:39.187
I only discovered it
by chance when I started
representing myself

01:53:39.271 --> 01:53:40.813
six years
into my sentence!

01:53:40.898 --> 01:53:42.482
But there it was
in the court file.

01:53:42.566 --> 01:53:45.026
But back in '77,
you buried it,
Counselor.

01:53:45.110 --> 01:53:47.778
Would you care to
tell the jury why?

01:53:49.698 --> 01:53:51.908
Would you care to
tell the court why?

01:53:54.244 --> 01:53:56.996
Because I know
he brutally raped her
and he beat her.

01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:58.915
Talk to me!
I'm standing here!

01:53:59.958 --> 01:54:01.501
Just because she
was promiscuous

01:54:01.585 --> 01:54:03.044
didn't give you
the right to rape her!

01:54:03.128 --> 01:54:05.254
You bragged to me
that you beat two prior

01:54:05.339 --> 01:54:06.881
aggravated rapes.
You were a menace!

01:54:06.965 --> 01:54:10.051
You were my lawyer!
You were my lawyer!

01:54:10.135 --> 01:54:12.929
That report could
have saved me 14 years.

01:54:13.013 --> 01:54:14.013
You're probably right.

01:54:14.097 --> 01:54:15.932
You self-righteous fuck!

01:54:20.771 --> 01:54:24.273
I'm Virgil, Counselor,
and I'm guiding you
through the gates of Hell.

01:54:24.358 --> 01:54:28.110
We are now
in the 9th circle,
the circle of traitors.

01:54:28.195 --> 01:54:31.531
Traitors to country,
traitors to fellow man,

01:54:31.615 --> 01:54:33.699
traitors to God!

01:54:33.784 --> 01:54:35.910
You, sir, are charged

01:54:35.994 --> 01:54:38.204
with betraying
the principles
of all three!

01:54:38.288 --> 01:54:40.998
Can you please quote for me
the American Bar Association's

01:54:41.083 --> 01:54:43.793
Rules of
Professional Conduct,
Canon seven?

01:54:45.295 --> 01:54:47.338
"A lawyer should
represent his client..."

01:54:47.422 --> 01:54:49.423
"Should zealously
represent his client

01:54:49.508 --> 01:54:51.217
"within the bounds
of the law."

01:54:51.301 --> 01:54:54.095
And I find you guilty,
Counselor,

01:54:54.179 --> 01:54:56.556
guilty of betraying
your fellow man,

01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:58.558
guilty of
betraying your country,

01:54:58.642 --> 01:55:00.601
guilty of
abrogating your oath,

01:55:00.686 --> 01:55:03.563
guilty of judging me
and selling me out!

01:55:03.647 --> 01:55:07.400
And with
the power vested in me
by the kingdom of God,

01:55:07.484 --> 01:55:11.946
I sentence you to
the 9th circle of Hell!

01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:14.740
Now you will learn
about loss,

01:55:14.825 --> 01:55:18.661
loss of freedom,
loss of humanity.

01:55:19.204 --> 01:55:22.999
Now you and I will truly
be the same, Counselor.

01:55:23.166 --> 01:55:25.167
Danielle,
get down on your knees.

01:55:25.252 --> 01:55:26.586
Both of you
take off your clothes!

01:55:26.670 --> 01:55:28.254
Down on your knees now!

01:55:28.338 --> 01:55:29.422
No, no, no.

01:55:29.506 --> 01:55:30.673
Down on your knees!

01:55:31.008 --> 01:55:32.967
Take off your clothes!
Get down on your knees!

01:55:34.803 --> 01:55:38.264
(SCREAMING) No! Don't!

01:55:40.851 --> 01:55:44.103
Now,
take off your clothes!
Off with your clothes!

01:55:44.187 --> 01:55:48.899
You, Leigh, take off
your clothes. Now!

01:55:48.984 --> 01:55:50.610
DANIELLE: No!

01:55:50.694 --> 01:55:52.695
CADY: Come on!
Git! Git!

01:55:52.779 --> 01:55:54.405
No!
Git!

01:55:55.032 --> 01:55:56.824
Tonight, you're gonna
learn to be an animal,

01:55:56.908 --> 01:55:59.035
to live like an animal
and to die like one.

01:56:03.206 --> 01:56:04.874
Give me your hand!

01:56:18.722 --> 01:56:20.056
(EXCLAIMING)

01:56:38.283 --> 01:56:39.825
No!

01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:41.410
Go! Go!

01:56:42.496 --> 01:56:43.704
(BOTH SCREAMING)

01:56:49.044 --> 01:56:50.836
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:58:48.371 --> 01:58:49.872
(SCREAMING)

01:59:06.097 --> 01:59:09.141
Did you forget about
that restraining order,
Counselor?

01:59:09.226 --> 01:59:11.811
You're well
within 500 yards!

01:59:12.854 --> 01:59:14.271
(LAUGHING)

01:59:18.485 --> 01:59:20.319
Well, here we are,
Counselor,

01:59:20.403 --> 01:59:23.447
just two lawyers
working it out!

01:59:24.574 --> 01:59:26.075
(YELLING)

01:59:27.828 --> 01:59:29.161
(LAUGHING)

01:59:37.546 --> 01:59:39.088
I'm going to kill you!

01:59:39.381 --> 01:59:42.591
You already
sacrificed me,
Counselor.

02:00:08.743 --> 02:00:10.911
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

02:00:28.096 --> 02:00:31.056
(SINGING) On Jordan's
stormy banks I stand

02:00:31.141 --> 02:00:34.059
Oh who will come
with me?

02:00:34.144 --> 02:00:47.656
I am bound for
the promised land

02:01:39.376 --> 02:01:40.542
(GASPS)

02:02:21.209 --> 02:02:22.751
(WHIMPERING)

02:02:27.257 --> 02:02:28.882
(SOBBING)

02:02:39.602 --> 02:02:44.064
DANIELLE: We never spoke
about what happened,
at least not to each other.

02:02:45.483 --> 02:02:51.363
Fear, I suppose,
that to remember his name
or what he did

02:02:51.448 --> 02:02:54.116
would mean letting him
into our dreams.

02:02:54.951 --> 02:02:58.328
And me, I hardly dream
about him anymore.

02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:03.751
Still, things won't
ever be the way they were
before he came.

02:03:04.377 --> 02:03:06.295
But that's all right

02:03:06.379 --> 02:03:10.340
because if you
hang onto the past,
you die a little every day.

02:03:11.259 --> 02:03:12.801
And for myself,

02:03:13.303 --> 02:03:15.137
I know I'd rather live.

02:03:16.431 --> 02:03:17.723
The end.
