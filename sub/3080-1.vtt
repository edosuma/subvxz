00:31.577 --> 00:34.847
We gotta move.
Stay with him, he's your life line!

00:35.147 --> 00:36.737
Follow me.

00:37.664 --> 00:39.307
Stay with me guys!

00:39.607 --> 00:41.554
- Incoming!
- Follow me, follow me!

00:41.654 --> 00:43.345
Recover north! On our way!

00:47.325 --> 00:49.236
Stay with me guys!

00:51.995 --> 00:54.466
There's something down there,
I tripped over something. Check it out!

00:54.566 --> 00:56.806
Check around, there must be
something with that pipe.

00:57.635 --> 00:59.822
Incoming! Get them down, get them down!

01:00.458 --> 01:02.341
Right around where I was.

01:02.841 --> 01:04.543
It's coming, it's coming fast.

01:04.643 --> 01:06.945
Perimeter, people! Give me a perimeter!

01:08.113 --> 01:10.082
- It's some kind of tunnel.
- Tank, come here.

01:15.686 --> 01:17.054
Incoming!

01:24.446 --> 01:26.599
Let's get down this hole.
Hook me up, Big Guy.

01:29.268 --> 01:31.267
Down you go. All right.

01:55.727 --> 01:57.560
Stay Down!

06:42.279 --> 06:45.081
What the fuck?

07:16.247 --> 07:23.085
At 0300, I received a Code 455.

07:25.289 --> 07:29.895
This was one of two
of the last remaining,

07:29.995 --> 07:34.466
non-infected, virus free women
on the planet.

07:34.566 --> 07:38.537
At 0200, her life ended.

07:38.637 --> 07:42.772
A victim of the OVT virus.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.307
This...

07:46.010 --> 07:48.247
is the last non-infected,

07:48.347 --> 07:52.983
virus free, fertile woman alive.

07:54.652 --> 07:57.520
She is your Package.

08:00.591 --> 08:04.496
This female is to be shipped off
planet immediately.

08:04.596 --> 08:08.667
At 1700 tonight, along with the Package,

08:08.767 --> 08:10.836
you will board the Oklahoma.

08:10.936 --> 08:15.841
At 1800 you will be cryoslept
for a seven month travel.

08:15.941 --> 08:18.108
Your 10-TSA destination...

08:19.877 --> 08:21.079
Earth Two.

08:21.179 --> 08:23.747
The rumors are true.

08:24.982 --> 08:29.121
We have been preparing
a planet for inhabitation.

08:29.221 --> 08:32.090
Four years' projected completion.

08:32.190 --> 08:37.095
The Oklahoma will land adjacent
to a heavily wooded area.

08:37.195 --> 08:40.131
You will secure
the Package off the ship.

08:40.232 --> 08:43.802
Walk the Package
200 feet to a transport.

08:43.902 --> 08:47.006
Secure the Package on the transport.

08:47.706 --> 08:50.909
Our nation has asked for the best unit.

08:51.009 --> 08:54.944
A unit that has never lost
a single Package.

08:55.679 --> 08:58.114
You are that unit.

08:59.350 --> 09:01.286
Let me be crystal,

09:01.386 --> 09:03.622
should a situation arise.

09:03.722 --> 09:09.261
Her pain, strain, cries or demands

09:09.361 --> 09:11.730
are of no significance.

09:11.830 --> 09:14.599
Not to me, not to you.

09:14.699 --> 09:17.425
This Package gets delivered.

09:28.946 --> 09:30.680
Thank you, Tank.

10:10.254 --> 10:12.557
Oh, fuck.

10:40.718 --> 10:42.685
What the fuck is that?

10:49.760 --> 10:51.707
How you wanna play this, chief?

10:57.335 --> 10:59.020
Get down!

11:00.738 --> 11:02.373
Down!

11:26.063 --> 11:27.580
Doc.

11:27.998 --> 11:29.219
Doc!

12:20.951 --> 12:22.718
Snoop!

12:28.726 --> 12:30.538
Oh, Jesus.

12:32.229 --> 12:35.831
Snoop, go get the Doc.

12:36.133 --> 12:37.267
Yeah.

12:44.975 --> 12:47.877
- Did we stop it?
- Just be still, man.

12:49.947 --> 12:53.718
- Doc, we need you. Let's go.
- I'm not, I'm not leaving her.

12:53.818 --> 12:56.253
We're not leaving her.
Come on, you come with me.

13:02.059 --> 13:04.053
Can you move your legs or your feet?

13:06.196 --> 13:07.830
The knife.

13:09.767 --> 13:12.468
- Can you feel that?
- No.

13:15.506 --> 13:16.975
Can you feel that?

13:17.475 --> 13:18.677
Feel what?

13:19.077 --> 13:21.386
He's intact. Back's not broke.

13:21.946 --> 13:23.239
Could wear...

13:43.835 --> 13:45.579
- Snoop!
- I'm on it!

13:59.149 --> 14:01.016
Snoop, talk to me.

14:01.919 --> 14:04.456
I'm working on it, I don't see
anything yet, I'm not through.

14:04.556 --> 14:07.623
- We have to move.
- Few more seconds.

14:09.693 --> 14:12.528
- You got eyes?
- No, not yet.

14:13.831 --> 14:17.402
- Can we at least move away from this?
- Just give me time.

14:17.502 --> 14:19.736
Come on, man, this is taking too long.

14:21.238 --> 14:24.342
I wanna get out of here.
I wanna go, I wanna leave.

14:24.442 --> 14:26.378
We definitely have company in here.

14:26.478 --> 14:30.980
Fuck. Okay, the order.

14:32.649 --> 14:34.753
Protocol. Tank leads.

14:34.853 --> 14:37.022
Then Package. Doc, go.

14:37.122 --> 14:39.758
- I'm gonna leave, I'm gonna get outta here.
- You bring him Snoop!

14:39.858 --> 14:42.727
- Go!
- Move!

14:42.927 --> 14:44.363
Snoop.

14:46.163 --> 14:48.032
I'm looking I don't...

14:48.132 --> 14:51.901
- Give me a minute, I've gotta find it.
- We don't have a fucking minute!

14:54.204 --> 14:57.040
Talk to me, come on.
Keep talking to me!

14:58.588 --> 15:01.379
I don't see anything.
Hold on. Hold on, hold on.

15:01.479 --> 15:05.059
- Can't see nothing?!
- Let me move it around, hold on, hold on!

15:13.791 --> 15:16.828
Can one of you tell me what
the hell just happened up there?

15:16.928 --> 15:19.364
I thought this planet
was classified blue?

15:19.464 --> 15:21.631
It was blue. It was, I...

15:24.335 --> 15:25.737
Talk to me, Snoop.

15:25.837 --> 15:29.218
Gimme a minute, I can see this
through my goggles, there's nothing...

15:29.318 --> 15:32.288
- Well, stick your ear to the hole.
- I'm...

15:39.616 --> 15:42.618
There's nothing there. Shit.

15:44.588 --> 15:48.293
When I say,
you're gonna pull this lever.

15:48.393 --> 15:51.029
As soon as it opens,
you gotta turn this,

15:51.129 --> 15:53.198
and you're gonna yank the door open.

15:53.298 --> 15:56.234
As soon as it opens,
you get behind it and stay back!

15:56.334 --> 15:57.602
Jesus Christ.

16:07.612 --> 16:09.144
Now!

16:15.652 --> 16:16.933
Snoop?

16:32.135 --> 16:33.638
Snoop!

16:36.940 --> 16:38.474
Tank!

16:42.012 --> 16:43.047
Tank!

16:43.147 --> 16:45.848
Crawl! We gotta crawl!

16:46.116 --> 16:47.227
We gotta what?!

16:48.119 --> 16:50.176
We have to, craw...!

17:01.298 --> 17:04.566
How do you know
those things aren't in there?

17:07.938 --> 17:09.771
Doc...

17:11.141 --> 17:12.974
Rifle.

17:26.123 --> 17:28.593
Go, we gotta get outta here.

17:30.436 --> 17:32.394
Come on, come on.

17:48.556 --> 17:50.408
Come on, man.

17:51.495 --> 17:52.508
Hold tight.

18:04.995 --> 18:06.228
Let's go!

18:09.165 --> 18:10.948
Okay,

18:11.663 --> 18:13.203
hold on.

18:13.303 --> 18:15.872
Grab the gear,
and get us the hell outta here.

18:38.728 --> 18:41.266
I'm gonna get up in this hole,
and I'll pull you up.

18:41.366 --> 18:43.365
Hold tight Snipe.

18:51.475 --> 18:52.856
Okay...

18:54.878 --> 18:58.247
Rest for minute,
but stay to the side and stay down.

19:19.971 --> 19:21.770
The door's closed.

19:24.741 --> 19:26.302
Snipe.

19:27.145 --> 19:30.259
Hey! The door's closed!

19:32.643 --> 19:33.951
Damn.

19:34.051 --> 19:36.588
What the? Snipe!

19:36.888 --> 19:38.720
Snipe!

19:51.802 --> 19:54.872
Come on. I've got you, you fu...

19:54.972 --> 19:56.705
Come on!

19:59.776 --> 20:03.715
Come on. I've got you ya fu...
Oh, Jesus...

20:03.815 --> 20:06.817
Come on! Come on, ya motherfucker!

20:13.524 --> 20:15.293
Come on, come on!

20:20.430 --> 20:22.598
Come on. I got you.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.109
Fuck!

20:38.682 --> 20:40.263
Tank...

20:42.619 --> 20:44.217
Doc...

20:45.589 --> 20:48.190
You don't think it stopped it, do you?

20:51.928 --> 20:53.297
Tank?

20:53.597 --> 20:55.033
Be quiet, okay?

20:55.133 --> 20:57.835
I need to hear this thing
because if I can't hear it,

20:57.935 --> 21:00.497
I don't hear it coming. All right?

21:01.905 --> 21:02.830
Come on.

21:34.504 --> 21:36.347
Okay, let's move.

22:00.330 --> 22:02.364
Anybody hear that?

22:09.406 --> 22:11.033
Get to the side.

22:15.313 --> 22:17.946
Doc, get your light down there.

22:20.918 --> 22:23.221
Lean back. Back!

22:23.321 --> 22:25.387
Doc, come here.

22:27.557 --> 22:29.864
Why, why am I going up there?

22:29.964 --> 22:33.064
- You handle a gun?
- No.

22:33.164 --> 22:36.434
It's easy. Point. Shoot.

22:36.534 --> 22:39.570
- I need you in the front.
- I lost my glasses. I can't see anything.

22:39.670 --> 22:43.946
Don't worry about your glasses, just...
Just get up here, Doc!

22:47.077 --> 22:50.381
I need you to stay in the front,
and keep your gun down the tunnel.

22:50.481 --> 22:52.550
- When you will you be back?
- Look at me!

22:52.650 --> 22:55.152
You keep your gun down the tunnel,
and you keep quiet.

22:55.252 --> 22:58.489
If you see anything,
you let me know, okay?

22:58.589 --> 23:00.024
All right, yeah.

23:00.124 --> 23:01.625
- Move.
- Tank.

23:02.577 --> 23:05.527
Move. Move Doc!

23:06.563 --> 23:11.103
Package, I need you up here.
Come on, move!

23:35.025 --> 23:36.174
Move!

24:03.019 --> 24:04.886
Package, go.

24:05.822 --> 24:07.989
Come on, go.

24:10.660 --> 24:12.461
Wait! Be quiet!

24:25.041 --> 24:26.908
Snoop!

24:29.112 --> 24:32.581
- Hail! Hail!
- Snoop!

24:46.463 --> 24:47.805
Where's Snipe?

24:51.134 --> 24:52.637
He didn't make it.

24:54.104 --> 24:56.607
- What are you doing back here?
- I got Doc up front.

24:56.707 --> 24:58.010
Doc?

24:58.609 --> 25:01.512
I need you up there,
get your damn head in the game!

25:01.612 --> 25:03.578
You need to get up front now!

25:07.384 --> 25:08.821
Tank.

25:09.752 --> 25:12.053
She's the only thing that matters now.

25:22.932 --> 25:25.467
- Get to the side!
- Let her through.

25:27.589 --> 25:31.776
Doc, I need you to do everything
Tank tells you, to the tee!

25:31.876 --> 25:33.875
Let me know what you see.

25:36.212 --> 25:38.113
All right, keep close.

25:46.489 --> 25:48.252
Come on.

26:01.404 --> 26:02.638
Wait, wait! Hold up!

26:24.460 --> 26:26.761
What do you see, Tank?

26:40.176 --> 26:41.254
It's a room.

26:43.179 --> 26:46.275
- Let's go. Is it clear?
- The tunnel keeps going, but...

26:47.017 --> 26:48.735
but there's a room here.

26:58.127 --> 27:00.498
It's clear, come on! Get back here!

27:00.598 --> 27:02.800
Package, you follow!

27:02.900 --> 27:04.807
Let's go people, we gotta move!

27:08.538 --> 27:10.872
Can't see shit.

27:11.407 --> 27:14.209
Package, Doc, opposite corners.

27:14.978 --> 27:18.082
If we could stay here a while,
it'd be good for her to rest.

27:18.282 --> 27:20.967
- She's gonna need...
- Five minutes, then we move.

27:21.919 --> 27:23.821
I know you're in charge.

27:23.921 --> 27:27.022
I understand that, and agree with that.

27:29.559 --> 27:33.931
The human body can regain almost
all it needs... 30 minutes of sleep.

27:34.031 --> 27:36.384
Thirty minutes, she's as good as new.

27:37.468 --> 27:41.203
Without it, in about an hour
we're dragging her.

27:46.276 --> 27:48.746
Can't afford to make a mistake on this.

27:48.846 --> 27:51.949
Whatever the hell this thing is, it's been
ripping through us like paper mache.

27:52.049 --> 27:55.750
- Snoop, she does look pretty beat.
- I can go.

28:11.467 --> 28:13.537
Listen, you got fifteen minutes.

28:13.837 --> 28:16.340
- And that's it!
- Thank you.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.957
Let's just hope you're thanking me if...

28:32.755 --> 28:34.622
Get in the tunnel!

29:20.670 --> 29:22.539
- What was that?
- What was that?!

30:01.577 --> 30:03.344
Move!

30:14.657 --> 30:18.796
- What is your problem?
- He's... he's not good in tight spaces.

30:18.896 --> 30:22.597
- You're not good in tight spaces?
- I'm not.

30:25.234 --> 30:29.907
You get your ass down that tunnel
or I'm leaving you here!

30:30.007 --> 30:32.173
Get the gun and move!

30:33.576 --> 30:35.444
Get up here, get up here.

30:51.661 --> 30:53.411
Doc, keep going.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.197
Move!

31:00.036 --> 31:03.106
- Maybe we should stop?
- Doc, if you don't move...

31:07.243 --> 31:09.377
Let's go. Go.

31:21.257 --> 31:23.194
- Stop! Stop!
- What?

31:23.294 --> 31:25.297
There's something in here.

31:26.462 --> 31:28.402
Get to the side.

32:05.601 --> 32:06.683
Come on.

32:26.923 --> 32:28.957
Do what you can,
but we're not staying long.

32:35.831 --> 32:38.470
Calm down, I'll tell you
when I'm needing the bathroom.

32:39.570 --> 32:43.907
Take these, rip 'em.
Wrap her hands and knees.

32:48.177 --> 32:50.011
I got a plan.

33:00.356 --> 33:05.226
Doc, get that gun.
I need you to cover the tunnel.

33:07.096 --> 33:10.053
Package, you stay down.

33:16.606 --> 33:18.373
Where are you going?

34:35.951 --> 34:37.985
I don't like this.

34:39.121 --> 34:40.822
Ok, alright.

35:03.079 --> 35:04.476
Ok, come on.

35:11.821 --> 35:13.311
Come on.

35:39.615 --> 35:42.719
This plan is not about how we all three
are getting up there, is it?

35:42.819 --> 35:45.656
If it moves over those lights,
we're gonna see it.

35:46.156 --> 35:50.060
And maybe if I can get one shot
into this thing we can kill it.

35:50.160 --> 35:53.427
Wait, we're waiting for this thing?

35:53.596 --> 35:56.600
Not once, not once have we
been able to stop this thing.

35:56.700 --> 36:00.771
- Not once have we gotten a clean shot.
- Everybody trying to kill this thing is dead.

36:00.871 --> 36:03.373
Look, you cover that tunnel, Doc.
Now I think we can kill it!

36:03.473 --> 36:07.309
We're not waiting for this thing
to come down here and eat us!

36:10.479 --> 36:14.318
I don't like this. I'd rather run.

36:14.418 --> 36:18.755
We got thirty feet.
If I don't stop it, if I can't stop it,

36:18.855 --> 36:20.924
we'll know in plenty of time,
and you guys get in that tunnel.

36:21.024 --> 36:25.760
- How are gonna get up without help?
- I can climb anything. I can!

37:52.177 --> 37:53.946
Go!

37:55.685 --> 37:57.670
You bitch!

38:14.469 --> 38:17.775
- Did you stop it?
- I don't know, go!

38:18.175 --> 38:21.645
- Go!
- She doesn't stand a chance with me.

38:22.045 --> 38:24.446
Not a chance. You go.

38:27.183 --> 38:31.552
Soon we're gonna run out of water,
and it doesn't matter anyway.

38:33.322 --> 38:35.363
All right, all right.

38:36.859 --> 38:38.562
You got a full clip, okay?

38:38.662 --> 38:40.931
I don't know,
maybe there's a weak point.

38:41.031 --> 38:45.237
- Okay?
- I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

38:45.935 --> 38:47.264
Go.

38:50.272 --> 38:51.596
Package!

39:32.081 --> 39:33.450
- Move.
- Where is he?

39:33.550 --> 39:34.608
Move!

40:46.155 --> 40:47.958
You need to move.

40:48.058 --> 40:49.657
Go!

40:55.197 --> 40:56.966
Go!

41:31.133 --> 41:32.767
All right.

41:33.502 --> 41:37.538
We gotta keep moving. Come on, come on!

41:58.595 --> 42:00.898
Do you hear that? What is it?

42:48.677 --> 42:50.355
Okay.

42:50.780 --> 42:54.484
- I want you to stay here until I say, okay?
- Okay.

42:54.584 --> 42:58.728
If you hear anything,
you call me, you got it?

42:59.856 --> 43:02.022
Don't move until I say.

43:03.191 --> 43:04.558
All right.

43:45.339 --> 43:47.401
Come on.

43:59.748 --> 44:02.912
Fu... God.

44:23.772 --> 44:25.708
Please, please.

44:33.115 --> 44:34.864
No.

44:49.064 --> 44:50.796
Dead end.

45:02.177 --> 45:04.708
God dammit.

45:16.191 --> 45:18.025
Come on.

45:25.968 --> 45:28.402
Ok, come on! Come on!

45:36.678 --> 45:38.088
Get up.

45:38.748 --> 45:41.566
Get in the corner, come on.

46:03.873 --> 46:05.706
Fuck!

46:23.793 --> 46:26.176
You have a choice now.

46:32.067 --> 46:34.106
We can stay here...

46:35.270 --> 46:37.638
and fight this thing.

46:40.942 --> 46:42.006
I can't...

46:44.513 --> 46:46.816
I will fight it...

46:46.916 --> 46:49.449
as hard as I can.

46:56.659 --> 46:58.058
Or...

46:58.860 --> 47:01.302
I can end this for you now.

47:01.897 --> 47:03.864
Before it gets...

47:04.699 --> 47:06.600
Messy...

47:07.702 --> 47:09.839
and painful.

47:09.939 --> 47:11.541
Because it will.

47:18.281 --> 47:20.113
Or...

47:20.715 --> 47:23.350
I can take you down that tunnel.

47:25.620 --> 47:28.055
Maybe to the end, but...

47:29.858 --> 47:32.326
All the air was coming from that pipe.

47:33.729 --> 47:35.717
That tunnel's dead.

47:44.972 --> 47:47.641
That's all I can offer you.

47:48.510 --> 47:52.282
A choice. A choice.

47:55.350 --> 47:57.453
But it's yours.

48:07.495 --> 48:09.229
Tank...

48:12.000 --> 48:14.034
I don't wanna die.

48:24.513 --> 48:26.179
Fuck.

48:37.325 --> 48:39.071
Then let's get the fuck outta here!

48:47.302 --> 48:49.970
Okay. Drink this.

48:55.926 --> 48:57.744
Put this on.

48:59.581 --> 49:01.551
Okay, hold that.

49:01.651 --> 49:05.288
I'll go in first, and you stay close
behind me, all right?

49:05.388 --> 49:08.589
- When you can't crawl anymore, I'll drag you.
- Thank you.

49:11.226 --> 49:12.693
Let's move.

49:46.695 --> 49:48.720
Come on!

51:14.649 --> 51:17.020
God dammit.

51:27.028 --> 51:29.663
- Come on!
- Okay, okay.

51:32.066 --> 51:33.300
Move!

52:45.440 --> 52:49.166
Move! Package, we gotta move!

52:52.046 --> 52:53.713
Dammit.

53:00.521 --> 53:02.255
Dammit.

53:50.438 --> 53:52.405
Okay.

53:52.841 --> 53:56.476
We gotta keep moving. Come on.

53:57.545 --> 53:59.281
Package.

55:33.074 --> 55:34.910
Don't stop!

55:35.010 --> 55:37.911
It's moving faster than us, we gotta go!

55:38.613 --> 55:41.114
Here we go. Here we go.

55:47.989 --> 55:51.191
- Tank.
- Come on!

55:51.759 --> 55:53.607
Come on!

56:12.180 --> 56:13.741
Tank!

56:14.581 --> 56:17.363
Come on! Move!

56:41.375 --> 56:43.643
Come on, keep going!

56:44.679 --> 56:46.511
Come on!

56:53.655 --> 56:55.524
Come on!

57:20.314 --> 57:22.018
Tank, help me!

57:29.891 --> 57:32.019
Please, Tank!

57:38.032 --> 57:39.854
Oh, my god!

57:41.737 --> 57:43.105
No!

57:54.382 --> 57:57.509
- Look at me.
- Tank, help me.

58:46.001 --> 58:48.753
Motherfu...

01:01:01.469 --> 01:01:03.005
All right.

01:03:21.743 --> 01:03:24.530
God dammit.

01:12:56.316 --> 01:12:58.108
Dammit.

01:13:01.004 --> 01:13:02.708
Okay.

01:19:09.522 --> 01:19:11.500
Hello?!

01:19:15.795 --> 01:19:17.963
I'm down here.

01:19:33.046 --> 01:19:35.179
Hello?!

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.795
I'm in here!

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.271
Come on.

01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:19.191
Come on.

01:22:48.508 --> 01:22:52.385
Pull it together. Come on, Tank.

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:56.014
Come on.

01:23:55.008 --> 01:23:57.111
You're coming with me.

01:24:00.013 --> 01:24:02.354
You're coming with me!

01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:06.090
You're coming with me.

01:25:08.347 --> 01:25:10.025
You're coming with me!

01:25:47.086 --> 01:25:48.753
She's up!

01:25:51.057 --> 01:25:53.060
- Is anybody else down there?
- That thing is down there.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.363
- Is there anybody else down there?
- No.

01:25:56.363 --> 01:25:59.310
- That thing...
- Is the Package safe?

01:26:00.233 --> 01:26:01.400
No.

01:26:06.439 --> 01:26:08.809
That thing is down there.

01:26:09.109 --> 01:26:12.256
- Hey, that thing.
- We know that thing's still down there.

01:26:13.447 --> 01:26:17.151
You probably figured out your bullets
won't kill 'em, but we know what will.

01:26:17.251 --> 01:26:19.053
Fire.

01:26:19.153 --> 01:26:22.356
We got a torch crew who's been
coming around and burning them out for us.

01:26:22.456 --> 01:26:24.992
We've been looking down these holes,
looking for you guys.

01:26:25.092 --> 01:26:26.969
We'll contact them, they'll be here.

01:26:28.395 --> 01:26:30.101
Fire?

01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:32.682
Fire kills it?

01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:36.525
Seems to be the only thing that does.

01:26:48.247 --> 01:26:49.948
Get back.

01:27:11.204 --> 01:27:12.763
Stand back.

01:27:49.075 --> 01:27:51.011
How far is the base?

01:27:51.111 --> 01:27:53.161
It's two miles from here.

01:28:18.904 --> 01:28:22.977
Not even a thank you. What a bitch.

01:28:23.477 --> 01:28:25.579
Yeah, she may be a bitch,

01:28:25.679 --> 01:28:28.757
but that's probably one of the
toughest chicks you'll ever meet.

01:28:34.086 --> 01:28:37.088
- What's her name?
- Her name?
