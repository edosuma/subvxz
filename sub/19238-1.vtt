00:49.179 --> 00:50.826
<i>I'm starting a new life.</i>

00:54.884 --> 00:58.780
<i>Up here where it's quiet
and clean among the Redwoods.</i>

00:59.555 --> 01:01.850
<i>And almost no one knows me.</i>

01:39.194 --> 01:41.089
<i>Poor Jerry.</i>

01:43.298 --> 01:45.761
<i>I had a nervous breakdown after he left me.</i>

01:50.439 --> 01:52.401
<i>They say I'm cured now.</i>

01:55.244 --> 01:58.107
<i>But I still have intrusive thoughts.</i>

02:05.271 --> 02:08.094
<i>My therapist told me
that I'm not unusual at all.</i>

02:10.425 --> 02:12.976
<i>People are abused all over the world...</i>

02:13.446 --> 02:14.964
<i>...every day.</i>

02:15.764 --> 02:17.656
<i>Much worse than me...</i>

02:19.334 --> 02:21.196
<i>...and they do fine.</i>

03:06.448 --> 03:08.251
Your tail light's out, miss.

03:10.831 --> 03:12.880
Thank you for letting me know.

03:13.755 --> 03:15.759
Are you gonna write me a ticket?

03:16.659 --> 03:19.810
I'll let you go this time,
but make sure you get it fixed.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.290
Thank you, officer.

03:25.134 --> 03:26.995
You drive safely.

03:50.953 --> 03:52.802
<i>When Jerry left me...</i>

03:52.902 --> 03:56.656
<i>...I devoured everything I could
about how to get your man back.</i>

03:57.833 --> 04:01.896
<i>According to the experts,
men are very fragile.</i>

04:05.190 --> 04:08.640
<i>They can get crushed down
if you assert yourself in any way.</i>

04:11.446 --> 04:13.492
You have to be very tricky.

04:59.394 --> 05:01.464
Elaine? Hi, I'm Trish.

05:01.564 --> 05:05.393
- Hi, Trish, it's nice to meet you.
- You're so pretty.

05:06.401 --> 05:08.972
I didn't mean anything.
I'm married and everything.

05:09.072 --> 05:11.341
No, I didn't think anything.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.664
Well, let me help you with your bags.

05:15.310 --> 05:17.280
- Is this all you've got?
- For now.

05:17.380 --> 05:19.449
My art supplies are being shipped over later.

05:19.549 --> 05:22.034
- So you're an artist?
- Yes, I am.

05:22.134 --> 05:25.170
- I'm an interior decorator.
- Really?

05:25.270 --> 05:26.864
Yes.

05:34.095 --> 05:37.926
That's how I met Barbara.
I decorated this apartment.

05:38.334 --> 05:40.170
It was lucky I still had the keys.

05:40.270 --> 05:42.792
Barbara didn't exactly know
when she'd be back.

05:56.652 --> 05:58.288
How do you know Barbara?

05:58.388 --> 06:00.856
We used to dance together in San Francisco.

06:02.323 --> 06:03.859
Really?

06:08.630 --> 06:10.834
Well, I hope you like the apartment.

06:10.934 --> 06:14.003
It's a bit garish
but Barbara wanted it that way.

06:14.103 --> 06:17.040
She had me take all of the colors
from the Thoth Tarot deck...

06:17.140 --> 06:20.873
...and she and her students did a bunch
of occult paintings for me to hang.

06:20.973 --> 06:23.605
She's into all that Wicca stuff.

06:29.118 --> 06:31.228
Well, this is it.

06:35.023 --> 06:37.159
Trish, I love it.

06:37.259 --> 06:40.095
- It's just beautiful.
- Really?

06:40.895 --> 06:43.633
I'm so glad.
I thought I may have overdone it.

06:43.733 --> 06:46.888
No, it's exactly my taste.

06:47.202 --> 06:49.822
You must be exhausted.
I'm sure you want to lie down.

06:49.922 --> 06:53.854
Actually, I was thinking about getting a bite
to eat. Do you know of a place around here?

06:54.144 --> 06:55.745
There's the Victorian Tea Room.

06:55.845 --> 06:58.148
We could go together,
if you don't mind the company.

06:58.691 --> 07:01.752
How fantastic. Where can I freshen up?

07:02.352 --> 07:05.927
- The bedroom is through there.
- I'll only be a moment.

07:39.121 --> 07:41.256
What a lovely room.

07:41.356 --> 07:43.973
Yes, isn't it? I love Victoriana.

07:44.372 --> 07:47.430
Being here is like being
a princess in a fairy tale.

07:47.530 --> 07:50.233
Do you have fairy princess fantasies, Elaine?

07:50.333 --> 07:55.494
Of course. We may be grown women,
but underneath we're just little girls...

07:55.594 --> 07:59.842
...dreaming about being carried off
by a prince on a white horse.

08:00.542 --> 08:03.986
Yes, I suppose so. It's ridiculous, isn't it?

08:10.785 --> 08:14.090
I don't think I've found
my prince charming yet...

08:14.190 --> 08:16.426
...but I think I found the formula.

08:16.526 --> 08:20.867
You know, I've been studying
parapsychology and I understand men...

08:20.967 --> 08:23.371
...so much better than I used to.

08:24.599 --> 08:27.907
If only I would have known
before what I know now.

08:30.972 --> 08:33.243
Then Jerry would have never left me.

08:33.743 --> 08:37.284
- Who's Jerry?
- My ex-husband.

08:38.246 --> 08:42.123
The day he left me was the day that I died.

08:44.253 --> 08:47.575
But then I was reborn as a witch.

08:49.358 --> 08:51.761
<i>Barbara and Dan brought me back to life.</i>

08:51.861 --> 08:56.818
<i>They taught me everything I know
about magic and about men.</i>

08:57.382 --> 08:59.385
Men are like children.

08:59.485 --> 09:02.138
They're very easy to please...

09:02.238 --> 09:04.714
...as long as we give them what they want.

09:12.738 --> 09:19.318
<i>I dreamed of a fairy lady in a strange land</i>

09:20.619 --> 09:27.198
<i>She captured the hearts
of all the boys and men</i>

09:29.353 --> 09:35.934
<i>She wore a gown of pink and purple roses</i>

09:44.496 --> 09:46.300
Where were we?

09:46.830 --> 09:50.119
Men, you said we need
to give them what they want.

09:50.219 --> 09:52.558
Well, what do men want?

09:52.658 --> 09:56.156
Just a pretty woman to love
and to take care of them...

09:56.626 --> 09:59.364
...and to make them feel like a man...

09:59.464 --> 10:02.499
...and to give them total freedom
in whatever they wanna do or be.

10:03.799 --> 10:05.968
But what about what we want?

10:06.068 --> 10:11.041
How are we going to be equals with men
if we keep catering to all of their needs?

10:11.141 --> 10:15.184
I think that if you want love,
you have to give love.

10:15.545 --> 10:19.588
Giving men sex is a way
of unlocking their love potential.

10:20.316 --> 10:23.820
You sound as if you'd been
brainwashed by the patriarchy.

10:24.220 --> 10:27.597
Your whole self-worth
is wrapped up in pleasing a man.

10:28.758 --> 10:31.966
I'll admit, I used sex to get this...

10:33.194 --> 10:35.131
...but I'm not proud of it.

10:35.231 --> 10:38.268
A whole world doesn't revolve
around a man's needs.

10:38.368 --> 10:42.004
If I gave Richard sex every time
he wanted it, I'd be a wreck.

10:42.104 --> 10:44.178
Poor Richard.

10:44.406 --> 10:49.750
He loves you and he wants you
and you torture him.

10:50.279 --> 10:52.582
You have to give a man his fantasy.

10:53.682 --> 10:55.651
His fantasy?

10:55.751 --> 10:58.535
Yes, his fantasy.

10:59.688 --> 11:02.424
But what I'm really interested in...

11:02.974 --> 11:04.816
...is love.

11:06.094 --> 11:08.537
You might say I'm addicted to love.

11:10.298 --> 11:12.374
I wonder if all women feel that way?

11:13.169 --> 11:15.878
Well, it depends on what you mean by love.

11:16.706 --> 11:21.077
A husband isn't a prince, Elaine,
and life isn't a fairy tale.

11:21.177 --> 11:24.151
- We have to face that fact.
- Why?

11:24.713 --> 11:27.817
Maybe life could be a fairy tale
if you pleased your husband more.

11:28.517 --> 11:32.889
I don't need to please Richard.
Richard loves me for myself.

11:32.989 --> 11:37.026
Of course. Maybe you did find
your prince charming.

11:37.126 --> 11:39.167
Perhaps I did.

11:51.873 --> 11:56.244
- Guess who.
- Richard. What are you doing here?

11:56.580 --> 11:59.215
This tea room is for ladies only.

11:59.929 --> 12:02.824
I went to visit you at work
and Julie said you were here.

12:02.924 --> 12:04.721
I thought we could have lunch together.

12:04.821 --> 12:08.698
Well, that's very sweet,
but I've already had my lunch.

12:08.798 --> 12:12.734
Richard, this is Elaine.
Elaine, this is my husband, Richard.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.621
I've heard so much about you, Richard.

12:16.131 --> 12:18.237
Nothing too horrible, I hope.

12:18.337 --> 12:20.391
On the contrary.

14:38.106 --> 14:39.761
Goddess...

14:40.261 --> 14:42.011
...please...

14:42.243 --> 14:46.016
...send me a beautiful, sweet man...

14:46.716 --> 14:50.238
...to love me as I love him.

14:54.490 --> 14:58.264
To love me, love me...

14:59.135 --> 15:00.764
...love me...

15:01.846 --> 15:03.548
...love me...

15:04.765 --> 15:06.243
...love me...

15:06.935 --> 15:08.789
...love me...

15:09.403 --> 15:10.638
...love me...

15:11.172 --> 15:13.027
...love me...

15:13.476 --> 15:15.330
...love me...

15:35.396 --> 15:39.201
- Hi, are you Wendy?
- Yes, what can I do for you?

15:39.341 --> 15:42.376
I'm Elaine. We spoke on the phone.

15:42.476 --> 15:45.274
I make natural soaps and candles and things.

15:45.374 --> 15:48.749
Elaine, right. Thanks for coming by.

15:48.877 --> 15:51.752
- Mind if I have a look?
- Please do.

15:59.087 --> 16:00.895
These are nice.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.933
Really nice.

16:06.995 --> 16:09.599
I think these will do well in the store.

16:09.899 --> 16:11.333
Then you'll take them?

16:11.433 --> 16:14.376
Let's start with these and see how they do.

16:18.840 --> 16:22.378
If these sell in the next week or two,
I'll order more. Sound good?

16:22.978 --> 16:26.181
Yes, fantastic. Thank you, Wendy.

16:26.281 --> 16:29.524
Sure, Elaine. Bright blessings.

17:08.957 --> 17:11.560
<i>People always ask me why I'm a witch.</i>

17:11.660 --> 17:15.664
<i>I tell them it's because
I wanna have magical powers.</i>

17:15.763 --> 17:17.767
<i>But it's not like it sounds.</i>

17:17.867 --> 17:22.175
<i>All it is is using your will
to get what you want.</i>

17:57.705 --> 17:59.346
Hi.

17:59.707 --> 18:01.347
Hi.

18:03.510 --> 18:07.121
- It's a beautiful day.
- Yes, it is.

18:07.782 --> 18:10.852
I love to be out in nature on days like this.

18:11.271 --> 18:13.901
- You like nature?
- Very much.

18:14.289 --> 18:16.706
You seem like a nature type too.

18:17.793 --> 18:20.596
I'll bet you like to spend time in the woods.

18:21.096 --> 18:23.598
That's right. How'd you know?

18:23.698 --> 18:27.502
I can just tell.
Nature is where your heart is.

18:28.037 --> 18:31.398
City and people can get
to be too much for you.

18:33.937 --> 18:37.151
That is a lot to get
from someone in a few seconds.

18:38.112 --> 18:39.951
I'm talented that way.

18:40.949 --> 18:43.509
Well, you're right about the city.

18:44.386 --> 18:48.973
In fact, I have a house out in
the woods about an hour from here.

18:49.475 --> 18:52.794
I like to go there whenever
I can to, you know...

18:52.894 --> 18:55.268
...just think and read.

18:56.230 --> 18:58.268
Do you take your wife up there?

18:58.768 --> 19:00.269
No.

19:01.269 --> 19:03.143
I'm not married.

19:03.771 --> 19:06.881
Well, you might at least take
a girl up there once in a while.

19:08.008 --> 19:11.535
I do. I do, once in a while.

19:12.380 --> 19:14.522
You wanna take a girl up there now?

19:19.252 --> 19:21.389
What do you mean?

19:21.489 --> 19:25.909
Well, I'm new in town and I haven't
seen much of the nature around here.

19:26.862 --> 19:29.104
I'll make you a nice dinner.

19:30.764 --> 19:34.302
Yes. Yes, okay, sure.

19:34.402 --> 19:36.644
My car is right over there.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.413
Okay.

19:40.041 --> 19:41.782
Let's go.

20:28.791 --> 20:31.027
You know what I'd like to do right now?

20:38.432 --> 20:42.447
I'd like to make love right here
in the car just like we were kids.

20:44.605 --> 20:46.647
Wait, wait.

20:50.911 --> 20:52.786
You want some?

20:54.015 --> 20:55.750
What is it?

20:55.850 --> 20:57.692
Something I made.

21:08.494 --> 21:10.804
That is... that is strong.

21:11.265 --> 21:13.073
Finish it.

21:31.418 --> 21:34.027
No, Wayne, Wayne, stop.

21:34.622 --> 21:37.715
Not here. Let's go inside.

21:50.304 --> 21:52.112
This is beautiful.

21:56.878 --> 21:58.819
I'll start the dinner.

22:49.297 --> 22:51.139
This looks delicious.

22:53.935 --> 22:55.743
To nature.

23:14.255 --> 23:16.525
This is really nice, isn't it?

23:17.625 --> 23:21.830
I like to come up here a lot
at the end of the semester to unwind.

23:21.930 --> 23:25.818
- Are you a teacher?
- Yeah, I teach at the university.

23:27.520 --> 23:28.836
What do you teach?

23:28.936 --> 23:33.586
English and French literature
with a focus on the 18th century.

23:34.209 --> 23:36.545
So, you must be quite a libertine.

23:36.645 --> 23:38.518
A libertine?

23:38.979 --> 23:41.860
- Why would you say that?
- You know.

23:41.960 --> 23:45.454
All of the dangerous liaisons,
Benny Hill stuff.

23:45.554 --> 23:47.622
Not to mention Casanova.

23:49.322 --> 23:52.094
Well, there were a lot of books
written in the 18th century.

23:52.194 --> 23:54.228
Well, is it true?

23:54.328 --> 23:56.603
Are you a libertine?

23:57.165 --> 23:59.104
Yes, I am.

23:59.204 --> 24:02.671
I love women. Does that bother you?

24:02.771 --> 24:04.578
On the contrary.

24:12.513 --> 24:14.562
I feel strange...

24:15.238 --> 24:16.865
...dizzy.

24:19.987 --> 24:21.858
What was in that drink you gave me?

24:22.758 --> 24:27.801
Organic berries, vodka, hallucinogenic herbs.

24:28.262 --> 24:30.504
Hallucinogenic herbs?

24:32.334 --> 24:35.643
Oh, baby. You are really wild.

24:40.975 --> 24:44.213
Would you mind if I made myself
more comfortable?

24:45.013 --> 24:46.521
Not at all.

25:11.071 --> 25:12.913
What the hell?

25:13.708 --> 25:15.548
Your coat.

25:15.830 --> 25:17.884
It's so bright.

25:21.382 --> 25:23.985
I always line my clothing.

25:24.585 --> 25:26.617
You have two selves.

25:27.521 --> 25:31.300
Dark and quiet that you show the world.

25:32.459 --> 25:34.468
Who do you give that to?

25:35.229 --> 25:37.098
The rainbow?

25:37.198 --> 25:39.807
I give the rainbow to you.

25:40.969 --> 25:44.309
Right now.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.682
Oh, God.

26:27.782 --> 26:30.189
Oh, Elaine.

26:31.151 --> 26:32.999
Look at you.

26:33.554 --> 26:35.796
You can make love to me now.

29:08.944 --> 29:10.945
What is it, Wayne?

29:11.445 --> 29:13.453
What is it, baby?

29:14.948 --> 29:18.824
Elaine, I feel so strange.

29:19.787 --> 29:23.556
It's all right, you're with me.

29:26.894 --> 29:28.535
Elaine.

29:30.364 --> 29:34.291
No woman has ever given herself
like that to me before.

29:35.002 --> 29:37.238
Life has been tough?

29:37.638 --> 29:40.646
Yeah, in a way.

29:43.994 --> 29:46.464
You're not like any other woman I've met.

29:47.382 --> 29:50.923
No games, no agendas.

29:51.485 --> 29:55.295
You just seem to take life as it is.

29:56.223 --> 29:58.860
Is there any other way to take life?

29:58.960 --> 30:02.735
Well, the women I've been with...

30:03.063 --> 30:07.125
...they all want you to make a bunch of
promises to 'em as soon as you sleep with 'em.

30:08.336 --> 30:13.307
But how can you commit to someone
that you don't even know? It's crazy.

30:13.407 --> 30:15.482
I know, baby.

30:16.109 --> 30:17.950
I know.

30:18.612 --> 30:21.580
I never thought I wanted
to be tied down to anybody.

30:23.168 --> 30:26.538
But it's just 'cause no one
was ever quite right.

30:27.888 --> 30:31.959
All the women that
I'm attracted to physically...

30:32.059 --> 30:34.268
...they're never bright enough.

30:34.729 --> 30:38.373
And all the bright ones
are homely and don't arouse me.

30:38.833 --> 30:40.956
That seems like quite a problem.

30:42.536 --> 30:44.379
It is.

30:46.040 --> 30:49.035
I feel my whole life as a loner...

30:49.143 --> 30:51.544
...thinkin' I didn't need anybody.

30:53.814 --> 30:56.017
But now I'm not so sure.

30:57.122 --> 30:58.724
Elaine.

30:59.453 --> 31:02.712
I have never felt real love like this before.

31:03.558 --> 31:07.062
You're just having
a lot of emotions right now.

31:10.998 --> 31:14.206
Elaine, I'm scared.

31:15.569 --> 31:18.185
I'm not used to feeling things so strongly.

31:19.707 --> 31:22.376
I can't take it, I can't take it.

31:26.046 --> 31:27.694
Elaine.

31:28.794 --> 31:30.447
I'm sick.

31:30.951 --> 31:32.592
I'm sick.

31:35.753 --> 31:37.703
It's all right.

31:37.991 --> 31:41.229
I've got you. I love you.

31:42.129 --> 31:45.372
And I'll always be here for you.

31:47.167 --> 31:49.409
Try to get some sleep.

31:58.378 --> 32:00.254
Elaine.

32:03.651 --> 32:06.943
Elaine, where are you?

32:07.154 --> 32:11.363
Elaine, where are you?

32:13.894 --> 32:17.432
<i>What a pussy. What a baby.</i>

32:17.532 --> 32:21.403
<i>I thought I'd found a real man,
but he's just like a little girl.</i>

32:21.503 --> 32:23.510
Elaine!

32:24.271 --> 32:28.348
<i>No one was ever there for me
when I was crying my heart out.</i>

32:29.094 --> 32:31.296
<i>No one ever comforted me.</i>

32:32.196 --> 32:34.036
<i>No one.</i>

33:47.154 --> 33:49.190
Good morning, Wayne.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.814
Hi, Elaine.

33:57.631 --> 34:01.086
Here, drink this.

34:09.842 --> 34:12.474
I had such horrible dreams last night.

34:13.380 --> 34:15.489
What did you dream about, baby.

34:16.451 --> 34:20.127
I dreamt that I was calling your name
and you didn't answer.

34:20.695 --> 34:25.465
I kept calling and calling,
but I couldn't find you.

34:28.094 --> 34:29.735
Elaine...

34:30.900 --> 34:33.167
...you love me, don't you?

34:33.266 --> 34:34.898
Of course, I love you.

34:36.014 --> 34:37.697
God.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.431
God, Elaine.

34:44.277 --> 34:46.085
Are you hungry?

34:47.581 --> 34:49.417
I don't know what I am.

34:49.917 --> 34:52.192
Well, try to get some sleep.

34:53.786 --> 34:55.428
Elaine.

34:56.606 --> 35:00.178
- Don't leave me.
- I'm not going anywhere, baby.

35:00.278 --> 35:02.152
I'll be right here.

35:29.122 --> 35:32.265
Wayne, wake up. It's late.

35:34.261 --> 35:35.952
Wayne.

35:36.296 --> 35:38.338
Wayne, baby, wake up.

35:39.933 --> 35:41.774
Wake up.

35:42.169 --> 35:43.810
Wayne.

36:58.728 --> 37:00.999
<i>Tampons aren't gross.</i>

37:01.249 --> 37:04.491
<i>Women bleed and that's a beautiful thing.</i>

37:05.753 --> 37:10.357
<i>Do you know that most men
have ever even seen a used tampon?</i>

37:16.163 --> 37:19.239
<i>Part of me can be with Wayne now.</i>

37:20.834 --> 37:22.508
<i>Always.</i>

37:24.571 --> 37:26.607
<i>I don't really mind death.</i>

37:26.951 --> 37:28.955
<i>I've buried people before.</i>

37:30.877 --> 37:32.952
<i>People I really cared about.</i>

37:37.284 --> 37:40.327
<i>In the end we're all just compost anyway.</i>

37:42.339 --> 37:44.781
<i>Everything regenerates.</i>

37:47.794 --> 37:49.643
<i>I'd like to come back as a cat.</i>

37:51.381 --> 37:54.299
<i>I've been so depressed since my cat died.</i>

37:55.003 --> 37:58.962
<i>His name was Greymalkin,
but he was black and white.</i>

38:00.440 --> 38:02.482
<i>He was my best friend.</i>

38:21.428 --> 38:23.837
I give the rainbow to you.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.541
Right now.

40:08.135 --> 40:10.009
Just a minute.

40:17.010 --> 40:19.547
Hi, Trish. Come on in.

40:19.647 --> 40:24.185
Hey, Elaine. You look gorgeous.
I love what you've done with your hair.

40:24.285 --> 40:25.986
Thank you.

40:26.086 --> 40:28.723
- What's up, honey?
- Well, I haven't been able to reach you...

40:28.823 --> 40:31.692
...so I thought I'd come over
to see if everything was all right.

40:31.792 --> 40:34.601
I'm fine. Really.

40:35.662 --> 40:40.125
Can I offer you something?
I just made some tea and cake.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.608
Just tea, thank you.

40:54.647 --> 40:58.225
- Cream and sugar?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

41:13.933 --> 41:16.671
So, what have you been so busy with?

41:16.771 --> 41:20.946
- A man, I hope.
- Yes, it was a man.

41:21.374 --> 41:23.453
But it didn't work out.

41:23.843 --> 41:26.631
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

41:26.974 --> 41:30.550
It's a shame and I really liked him.

41:31.284 --> 41:35.328
- I thought that he was the one.
- Well, maybe next time.

41:36.556 --> 41:38.960
Are you sure you won't have some cake?

41:39.460 --> 41:41.395
No, thank you.

41:41.495 --> 41:45.566
I just came over to check up
on you and to say goodbye.

41:46.066 --> 41:49.503
Goodbye? Why, where are you going?

41:49.903 --> 41:52.541
Just to Dallas for a furniture convention.

41:54.241 --> 41:58.078
- Is Richard going with you?
- No, it's just a business trip.

41:58.178 --> 42:00.988
Richard will have to fend
for himself for awhile.

42:36.983 --> 42:39.253
Sam, give me two whiskeys on the rocks.

42:39.353 --> 42:41.327
Sure thing, Jane.

42:42.422 --> 42:45.275
- You see the papers today?
- No, why?

42:45.375 --> 42:49.396
- They found a body in the Eel River.
- A murder?

42:49.496 --> 42:50.850
Maybe.

42:51.465 --> 42:55.841
They found a symbol carved in his chest.

42:56.369 --> 42:57.910
Here.

43:00.672 --> 43:04.484
- It's a pentagram.
- It's them witches again.

43:04.927 --> 43:07.321
That's what I was thinking too, Lyle.

43:10.217 --> 43:13.521
So, yeah, Barbara, that's everything.

43:13.621 --> 43:17.158
After Jerry died,
the cops wouldn't stop harassing me.

43:17.958 --> 43:22.363
They couldn't prove anything.
They actually thought that I killed him.

43:22.463 --> 43:24.470
Can you believe it?

43:25.198 --> 43:27.186
Anyways...

43:27.286 --> 43:31.110
...San Francisco got to be
a really bad trip after you left.

43:32.038 --> 43:34.742
That's when I remembered
you had that extra apartment.

43:34.842 --> 43:39.113
Well, it was perfect timing.
I'm just sorry I wasn't here to greet you.

43:39.213 --> 43:42.782
That's all right. Trish has been lovely.

43:42.882 --> 43:45.219
And I've been getting a lot of artwork done.

43:45.319 --> 43:50.662
But I had this experience last weekend
that really... shook me up.

43:51.791 --> 43:53.461
Why, what happened?

43:53.561 --> 43:56.397
Well, I met this great-looking guy.

43:56.497 --> 43:58.666
And I used love magic on him.

43:58.966 --> 44:01.841
Then he got really weird on me.

44:02.502 --> 44:06.346
All these emotions
started flowing out of him.

44:08.041 --> 44:10.049
Then he got really...

44:11.277 --> 44:12.946
...sick.

44:13.046 --> 44:15.249
Well, guys can't handle
their emotions too well.

44:15.349 --> 44:17.618
That's why they don't like
heavy conversations.

44:18.218 --> 44:20.354
It was probably just too much for him.

44:20.454 --> 44:23.758
All the love and the great sex
that you were giving him.

44:24.158 --> 44:26.427
I guess that's what it was.

44:27.127 --> 44:29.052
But I don't know.

44:30.063 --> 44:32.016
Honey, you have to be more careful.

44:32.116 --> 44:35.831
Maybe you shouldn't be messing with
love spells in the first place, you know.

44:38.104 --> 44:40.646
Merry meet, Elaine.

44:40.974 --> 44:43.482
Bright blessings, Gahan.

45:01.861 --> 45:04.332
I heard you discussing love spells.

45:04.732 --> 45:06.567
You do have to be careful, Elaine.

45:06.667 --> 45:09.808
Love spells never work
the way you think they will.

45:10.438 --> 45:13.541
But on a lighter note,
it's wonderful to see you, Elaine.

45:14.041 --> 45:16.277
What's it been now, a year?

45:16.377 --> 45:19.814
We must celebrate
this reunion of dear friends.

45:22.214 --> 45:27.054
Thank you Goddess everywhere
for the blessings that we share.

45:27.154 --> 45:30.129
Blessed be, Variah.

45:31.924 --> 45:34.133
Go home, witches.

45:35.261 --> 45:36.602
Go home.

45:37.330 --> 45:39.654
Just ignore them.
They're always giving us trouble.

45:40.134 --> 45:42.770
I didn't know this town
was hostile to witches.

45:42.870 --> 45:47.141
Well, it's certainly not San Francisco.
But it's not bad for a small town.

45:47.641 --> 45:51.212
Not all of them embrace
our methods of practicing witchcraft.

45:51.312 --> 45:55.049
But I don't see why we
ought to be so uptight now.

45:55.149 --> 45:58.586
Back in the day, we all made love freely...

45:58.686 --> 46:02.690
...and put up Baphomet posters
and no one was dogmatic...

46:02.790 --> 46:06.260
...about whether they were a witch
or a Satanist or Thelemites...

46:06.360 --> 46:09.614
...or a druid or a Wiccan or whatever.

46:10.096 --> 46:11.897
And it was fun.

46:12.866 --> 46:16.075
But our classes and circles
have been very popular.

46:21.308 --> 46:23.426
- What have you been teaching?
- Let's see...

46:23.526 --> 46:25.613
...I've got a new class on sigil magic...

46:25.713 --> 46:29.249
...and Barbara's got a new class
on organite alchemy.

46:29.349 --> 46:31.619
Otherwise, we're still
teaching the staples...

46:31.719 --> 46:36.156
...energy grounding, earth-based
spirituality, pagan arts and crafts...

46:36.256 --> 46:40.828
...candle work, the spellcraft
master class, ancient mysticism...

46:40.928 --> 46:44.650
...herbs and spices,
and sex magic, of course.

46:46.657 --> 46:49.495
- Are you still teaching that?
- Yes.

46:49.595 --> 46:52.506
In fact, we've invited
some girls here tonight...

46:52.606 --> 46:56.715
...for a seminar about
the power of sexual dancing.

46:57.077 --> 47:00.961
Dancing is such a powerful thing
for women and girls.

47:01.681 --> 47:03.183
Are you still dancing?

47:03.283 --> 47:06.419
Yeah, some of us dance here
on amateur night. You should come.

47:09.022 --> 47:12.403
Hi, Barbara. Hi, Gahan. Sorry we're late.

47:13.293 --> 47:15.558
Hello, lovely ladies, please have a seat.

47:18.397 --> 47:22.002
Elaine, this is Star and her sister Moon.

47:22.102 --> 47:26.373
They're our students for tonight.
Girls, this is our dear friend Elaine.

47:26.773 --> 47:29.581
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:29.976 --> 47:33.948
I was just pointing out that dancing
is a powerful thing for women and girls.

47:34.448 --> 47:38.051
We asked you to meet us here tonight
so you could learn about that.

47:40.586 --> 47:43.625
Do you see how powerful that girl is?

47:44.807 --> 47:46.750
These men would do anything for her.

47:47.895 --> 47:50.965
Wouldn't you like to have
that power yourselves?

47:52.665 --> 47:54.473
Then let us begin.

47:54.801 --> 47:58.672
All witches need to figure out
where their power lies.

47:58.772 --> 48:03.683
And we feel that a woman's
greatest power lies in her sexuality.

48:04.511 --> 48:09.183
We don't view this power
as satanic or anti-feminist...

48:09.283 --> 48:13.192
...but as a celebration of woman
as a natural creature.

48:13.721 --> 48:18.497
An earthly body,
a spiritual essence, and a womb.

48:20.393 --> 48:23.430
The whole history
of witchcraft is interwoven...

48:23.530 --> 48:26.327
...with the fear of female sexuality.

48:26.427 --> 48:28.389
They burned us at the stake...

48:28.489 --> 48:32.006
...because they feared the erotic
feelings we illicited in them.

48:32.306 --> 48:36.022
Later, they used marriage
to hold us in bondage...

48:36.122 --> 48:40.030
...and made us into servants,
whores, and fantasy dolls.

48:40.480 --> 48:42.522
Never asking us what we wanted.

48:43.316 --> 48:44.774
They teach us...

48:44.874 --> 48:48.862
...that a normative human being
is a hyper-rationalist, stoic male...

48:49.356 --> 48:52.173
...and that women's emotions
and intuitions...

48:52.273 --> 48:55.034
...are illnesses that need to be cured.

48:55.862 --> 48:59.376
And they believe that men
and women are different...

48:59.476 --> 49:03.242
...and that true equality
lies in that difference.

49:03.637 --> 49:06.025
We strive for male/female polarity...

49:06.125 --> 49:09.389
...and to regain our primal power
as goddesses.

49:10.077 --> 49:14.915
We need to teach men how to love us
using ways they can understand.

49:15.015 --> 49:17.990
So Goddesses, use perfume...

49:18.651 --> 49:21.326
...wear high heels and makeup...

49:21.521 --> 49:24.175
...learn to dress your hair
in attractive ways...

49:24.725 --> 49:29.301
...display flesh artfully,
and know what to conceal.

49:30.262 --> 49:32.393
Be a mother and a lover.

49:33.066 --> 49:34.976
Stand your ground...

49:35.076 --> 49:39.451
...but always let the man feel like a man.

49:39.972 --> 49:43.110
Use sex magic to destroy his fear of you...

49:43.210 --> 49:46.147
...and to open his heart
to the floodgates of love.

49:46.847 --> 49:50.550
Only then will he begin to see you
as a human being...

49:50.650 --> 49:52.659
...with all of your inner beauty.

49:53.087 --> 49:55.920
Then, when his heart is open to love...

49:56.020 --> 49:58.318
...you may do with him what you will.

50:19.212 --> 50:21.155
<i>I love you, Elaine.</i>

50:22.715 --> 50:24.757
<i>You know that, don't you?</i>

50:26.786 --> 50:28.827
<i>I love you very much.</i>

50:31.858 --> 50:34.433
<i>But you need to be more careful.</i>

50:37.096 --> 50:39.973
<i>Dinner was late three times this week.</i>

50:40.684 --> 50:43.292
<i>And that house is a total pigsty.</i>

50:44.603 --> 50:48.174
<i>Do you know that I found an old hot dog...</i>

50:48.274 --> 50:50.315
<i>...under the bed this morning?</i>

50:52.579 --> 50:54.949
<i>And why don't you ever brush your hair?</i>

50:55.649 --> 51:00.450
<i>You need to take better care
of yourself and of the house.</i>

51:00.953 --> 51:03.463
<i>I'm embarrassed to have people over.</i>

51:04.441 --> 51:09.733
<i>I've been really patient up until now,
but you need to step up your game.</i>

51:11.831 --> 51:14.768
<i>I have a crazy bitch for a daughter.</i>

51:17.368 --> 51:20.236
<i>What? You're not crazy.</i>

51:20.336 --> 51:23.377
<i>Well, if you're not crazy then you're stupid.</i>

51:23.477 --> 51:26.546
<i>Which is it? Are you crazy or are you stupid?</i>

51:26.646 --> 51:28.882
<i>And you could lose a few pounds.</i>

51:28.982 --> 51:31.390
<i>You're looking a little fatty.</i>

51:33.788 --> 51:36.231
<i>Oh, my God, Elaine...</i>

51:36.331 --> 51:38.561
<i>...you've lost so much weight.</i>

51:38.892 --> 51:41.300
<i>You have such a hot body now.</i>

51:42.361 --> 51:44.865
<i>Do you like it when I touch you like this?</i>

51:45.565 --> 51:47.372
<i>Or like this?</i>

51:49.536 --> 51:51.577
<i>I wanna make you come.</i>

51:55.876 --> 51:58.111
<i>Don't be frightened, Elaine.</i>

51:58.211 --> 52:00.430
<i>I would never hurt you.</i>

52:01.080 --> 52:03.321
<i>I'm not the big, bad wolf.</i>

52:03.816 --> 52:07.926
<i>You need to have perfect love
and perfect trust.</i>

52:45.558 --> 52:48.057
Hast thou the courage to make the assay?

52:48.428 --> 52:53.505
I have two words,
perfect love and perfect trust.

53:11.383 --> 53:14.860
Assist me to erect the ancient altar...

53:15.621 --> 53:19.440
...at which in days past all worshiped.

53:19.859 --> 53:24.147
From the old times, a woman was the altar.

53:24.463 --> 53:29.064
And the sacred place was the point
within the center of the circle...

53:29.764 --> 53:32.127
...the origin of all things.

53:34.573 --> 53:37.283
Therefore, should we adore it.

54:07.573 --> 54:09.743
Good morning, Sergeant Griff.

54:09.843 --> 54:12.079
Congratulations on your promotion.

54:12.779 --> 54:15.849
Thanks, Connie. Is there any coffee?

54:15.949 --> 54:19.406
Yeah, I just made some.
I made it just the way you like it.

54:21.020 --> 54:23.557
Is there anything you don't do well?

54:23.657 --> 54:26.666
Why don't you try me sometime and find out?

54:32.998 --> 54:34.801
How's the coffee, Steve?

54:35.401 --> 54:37.241
Too strong.

54:39.137 --> 54:41.113
Well, I like it strong.

54:41.213 --> 54:43.977
Man's gotta stay awake on the job after all.

54:44.477 --> 54:46.881
Why, have you been keeping late nights?

54:47.881 --> 54:49.687
Maybe so.

54:52.952 --> 54:54.654
But now that you've been promoted...

54:54.754 --> 54:57.724
...maybe you ought to start thinking
about settling down.

54:57.824 --> 55:00.832
Me, you kidding?

55:05.598 --> 55:08.975
Sergeant Meadows, a lady's here to see you.

55:09.802 --> 55:13.321
I'm Shelly Curtis.
I phoned about Wayne Peters...

55:13.421 --> 55:15.272
...the teacher who disappeared.

55:15.808 --> 55:19.212
Yes, of course. Have a seat, Miss Curtis.

55:21.714 --> 55:25.285
You say you think Mr. Peters
might have been kidnapped?

55:25.385 --> 55:28.127
Yes, no one's seen him for two weeks.

55:28.855 --> 55:32.664
I went by his house and the mail's piled up.

55:33.232 --> 55:35.996
We had lunch the day he disappeared.

55:36.096 --> 55:39.833
I saw him drive away
with a strange woman near the Plaza.

55:39.933 --> 55:42.836
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone with her?

55:42.936 --> 55:48.006
Wayne used to spend weekends
up in a cabin he had in the woods.

55:49.041 --> 55:51.049
He used to take dates there.

56:25.265 --> 56:26.884
Jesus.

56:46.932 --> 56:49.440
Hey, Griff, look.

56:50.002 --> 56:51.876
Good Lord.

57:00.479 --> 57:02.554
What the hell is this?

57:03.583 --> 57:05.197
I don't know.

57:12.791 --> 57:15.767
- We're going to have to dig, Steve.
- I know.

57:21.768 --> 57:24.263
I think you should go back
to the house, Shelly.

57:56.152 --> 57:58.987
This cake is absolutely fantastic.

57:59.491 --> 58:01.140
And what a great dinner.

58:01.240 --> 58:04.249
Thank you. I enjoy cooking.

58:05.511 --> 58:07.781
Hope you don't mind my calling you.

58:08.281 --> 58:10.437
Sometimes it's so hard to be alone.

58:11.117 --> 58:12.985
Not at all.

58:13.811 --> 58:16.796
I get a little lonely, too
when Trisha is out of town.

58:24.997 --> 58:29.235
- How long have you and Trish been married?
- 10 years this September.

58:29.335 --> 58:31.343
10 years?

58:32.238 --> 58:34.312
It's really amazing.

58:35.708 --> 58:38.944
No one has ever loved me
the way you love Trish.

58:39.462 --> 58:41.329
No one.

58:47.086 --> 58:49.361
What about your husband?

58:49.822 --> 58:51.991
My husband never loved me.

58:52.091 --> 58:55.385
He couldn't wait to get away from me.

58:55.761 --> 58:57.569
I'm sorry.

59:06.572 --> 59:11.177
Sometimes I think Trish
would like to get away from me, too.

59:11.677 --> 59:13.264
Poor baby.

59:13.946 --> 59:16.687
Poor, poor baby.

59:45.711 --> 59:47.610
So, tell me...

59:48.382 --> 59:50.450
...what turns you on?

59:52.016 --> 59:54.026
What turns me on?

59:56.304 --> 59:59.439
No one's ever asked me that before.
Let me think.

01:00:01.026 --> 01:00:03.430
You know what really turns me on?

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:05.631
Flying.

01:00:05.731 --> 01:00:09.271
- Flying?
- Yeah, flying a plane.

01:00:09.602 --> 01:00:11.905
You don't know what kinda high it is.

01:00:12.005 --> 01:00:14.624
You're soarin' up there above everything.

01:00:14.874 --> 01:00:16.909
You're in control.

01:00:17.938 --> 01:00:21.149
- How fantastic.
- It really is.

01:00:21.714 --> 01:00:24.991
It's the only time I feel
really clear about things.

01:00:26.152 --> 01:00:29.192
Sometimes I look at my life
and I wonder how I got here.

01:00:34.893 --> 01:00:38.865
I feel like my life is slipping away
and there's so many things I haven't done.

01:00:38.965 --> 01:00:41.968
- Like what?
- I've never had any sort of love affairs...

01:00:42.068 --> 01:00:44.450
...or gotten into any mischief.

01:00:45.771 --> 01:00:48.143
I used to watch those old Steve McQueen
movies, you know...

01:00:48.243 --> 01:00:51.102
...the ones where they'd rob
a bank or something...

01:00:51.202 --> 01:00:55.227
...and I'd fantasize that I was one
of those crazy kinda gangsters...

01:00:55.327 --> 01:00:57.822
...with a sexy, messed up girl on my arm.

01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:00.524
Or those westerns...

01:01:01.184 --> 01:01:05.158
...when they'd shoot up a town
and then go visit the local prostitutes.

01:01:05.658 --> 01:01:07.694
It sounds stupid, I know.

01:01:07.794 --> 01:01:10.301
No, it doesn't.

01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:13.571
It's very sweet.

01:01:14.666 --> 01:01:16.507
Really?

01:01:17.669 --> 01:01:19.711
Trish doesn't think so.

01:01:20.706 --> 01:01:23.276
She just rolls her eyes
when I talk like this.

01:01:23.376 --> 01:01:26.513
That's because she doesn't understand you.

01:01:27.313 --> 01:01:31.088
I understand you perfectly.

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:34.492
- You do?
- Of course.

01:01:35.654 --> 01:01:38.628
You wanna have a sordid love affair.

01:01:39.591 --> 01:01:41.859
You wanna get into some mischief.

01:03:24.997 --> 01:03:26.871
Who are you?

01:03:26.999 --> 01:03:29.168
What are you doing to me?

01:03:29.568 --> 01:03:31.609
I'm the love witch.

01:03:32.771 --> 01:03:35.515
I'm your ultimate fantasy.

01:03:36.175 --> 01:03:38.049
That's right.

01:03:39.979 --> 01:03:42.052
That's right.

01:03:47.953 --> 01:03:50.156
Steve, I'm going out
to see that witch doctor.

01:03:50.256 --> 01:03:52.559
- Who?
- Professor King.

01:03:52.659 --> 01:03:55.394
He specializes in black magic and witchcraft.

01:03:55.494 --> 01:03:58.064
He might be able to help me identify
some of the items we found.

01:03:58.164 --> 01:04:01.034
It's great. Did you get the lab report?

01:04:01.134 --> 01:04:04.343
Yeah, yeah, it looks like heart failure.

01:04:04.814 --> 01:04:08.174
But the toxicology report
showed traces of jimsonweed...

01:04:08.274 --> 01:04:12.444
...also known as devil's weed,
a highly toxic hallucinogenic.

01:04:12.544 --> 01:04:16.014
It's unbelievable.
You want me to come with you?

01:04:16.614 --> 01:04:19.018
No, this will only take a few minutes.

01:04:19.118 --> 01:04:21.721
Can you order me a turkey
and avocado on whole wheat?

01:04:21.821 --> 01:04:23.555
Mustard, mayo?

01:04:23.655 --> 01:04:26.393
Yeah, and cole slaw. Thanks.

01:04:26.493 --> 01:04:28.133
Done.

01:04:37.168 --> 01:04:39.839
Sergeant Meadows,
sorry to have kept you waiting.

01:04:39.939 --> 01:04:42.047
Glad to meet you, professor.

01:04:45.277 --> 01:04:49.908
Professor, this is the bottle we found
in a grave of Wayne Peters...

01:04:50.008 --> 01:04:52.218
...the one you read about in the paper.

01:04:52.318 --> 01:04:54.390
Interesting, yes.

01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:00.026
Just as I thought. The contents
indicate that it's a witch bottle.

01:05:00.126 --> 01:05:01.427
A witch bottle?

01:05:01.527 --> 01:05:05.097
Yes, witches used to make them
for protection against curses.

01:05:05.197 --> 01:05:08.768
They'd take something personal
like bodily fluids or hair...

01:05:08.868 --> 01:05:12.228
...along with herbs and something sharp
like pins or broken glass...

01:05:12.778 --> 01:05:14.774
...to scare away evil spirits.

01:05:14.874 --> 01:05:18.444
Witch bottles have often been found
buried in the hearse of very old houses.

01:05:18.544 --> 01:05:22.648
Would it be safe to assume that
the person who made this was a witch?

01:05:22.748 --> 01:05:24.217
It's very likely.

01:05:24.317 --> 01:05:28.955
Witchcraft, long dormant in civilized
places, has taken root again in cities.

01:05:29.055 --> 01:05:30.810
There have several rituals per year.

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:34.694
One of them, Samhain,
corresponds of our Halloween.

01:05:35.294 --> 01:05:38.832
Other rituals celebrate
summer solstice, Litha...

01:05:38.932 --> 01:05:42.174
...or the winter solstice,
which they call Imolg.

01:05:46.371 --> 01:05:50.783
Here the members of a coven kiss the devil's
behind in a mockery of Christian rituals.

01:05:53.712 --> 01:05:57.755
Here, a satanic cult sacrifices a child.

01:05:58.383 --> 01:06:01.654
- Does this stuff really go on today?
- Yes, indeed.

01:06:01.754 --> 01:06:05.224
Those who practice human sacrifice
are the black witches...

01:06:05.324 --> 01:06:07.994
...who perform blood rituals
to gain demonic powers...

01:06:08.094 --> 01:06:11.197
...and to bind their members
together in secrecy.

01:06:11.297 --> 01:06:15.335
Law has been trying to root out these cults
for decades but they've been unsuccessful.

01:06:15.835 --> 01:06:20.373
Then there are the white witches or Wiccans
who commune in nature in the healing spirit...

01:06:20.473 --> 01:06:23.592
...and who have a strict law
that forbids harming others.

01:06:23.692 --> 01:06:27.246
Every city and rural village today has
pockets of both black and white witches...

01:06:27.346 --> 01:06:29.355
...who practice the ancient rites.

01:07:00.912 --> 01:07:06.090
I invoke and call upon thee,
mighty mother of us all.

01:07:06.651 --> 01:07:10.458
I invoke thee to descend upon the body...

01:07:10.558 --> 01:07:14.098
...of this thy servant and priestess.

01:07:15.593 --> 01:07:18.164
Of the mother darksome and divine...

01:07:18.264 --> 01:07:20.759
...here I charge you in this sign.

01:07:23.435 --> 01:07:26.178
Listen to the words of the great mother.

01:07:29.141 --> 01:07:32.478
She, who of old,
who was also called Artemis...

01:07:32.778 --> 01:07:35.586
...Aphrodite, Ceridwyn...

01:07:35.686 --> 01:07:38.150
...Diana, Isis...

01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:41.158
...and by many other names.

01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:46.292
Whenever ye have need of anything...

01:07:46.392 --> 01:07:49.853
...then ye shall assemble
in some secret place...

01:07:49.953 --> 01:07:51.596
...and adore me...

01:07:51.696 --> 01:07:53.978
...who am queen of all witches.

01:07:54.533 --> 01:07:56.831
There shall ye assemble...

01:07:56.931 --> 01:07:59.877
...ye who are fain to learn all sorcery.

01:08:00.672 --> 01:08:05.127
Behold all acts of love
and pleasure are my rituals.

01:08:05.811 --> 01:08:08.962
Behold I have been with thee
from the beginning...

01:08:09.062 --> 01:08:13.358
...and I am that which is attained
at the end of desire.

01:08:35.941 --> 01:08:37.581
Arise.

01:09:18.649 --> 01:09:22.529
You're looking a little tense tonight,
love. What's the matter?

01:09:23.455 --> 01:09:27.560
Nothing, just my usual
roller coaster love life.

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:29.595
Well, have a drink and relax.

01:09:29.694 --> 01:09:33.618
Nothing's that dire, at least not for you.

01:09:33.732 --> 01:09:37.408
It's an entirely different story
for your victims.

01:09:39.371 --> 01:09:40.406
What victims?

01:09:40.506 --> 01:09:44.176
There's no need to play
Miss Innocent with me, dearie.

01:09:44.277 --> 01:09:46.350
Please, don't touch me.

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:56.622
- Bright blessings, Barbara.
- Merry meet, Elaine. How's it going?

01:09:56.722 --> 01:10:00.292
- I'm back in the dating pool again.
- What happened?

01:10:00.392 --> 01:10:04.629
I thought you were crazy about that new
guy you were seeing, the married man.

01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:06.898
No, I broke it off.

01:10:06.998 --> 01:10:10.508
He just became really obsessive, morose...

01:10:11.202 --> 01:10:14.075
...and his aura became really murky.

01:10:14.506 --> 01:10:17.677
He didn't even wanna make love anymore.

01:10:17.777 --> 01:10:21.797
He became just like a woman,
crying at every little thing.

01:10:22.347 --> 01:10:24.350
There was no polarity.

01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:28.674
But I should have known. He's a Pisces.

01:10:59.484 --> 01:11:01.125
Richard.

01:11:03.621 --> 01:11:07.093
I thought I told you never to
interrupt me when I'm working.

01:11:07.193 --> 01:11:08.733
What do you want?

01:11:09.595 --> 01:11:13.105
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm going to bed and I'm taking a pill.

01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:34.052
Are you coming to bed?

01:11:34.152 --> 01:11:35.660
No.

01:11:41.159 --> 01:11:43.169
I have some more work to do.

01:11:46.364 --> 01:11:49.074
All right, see you tomorrow, then.

01:13:23.928 --> 01:13:26.465
Sergeant Griff Meadows
of the Police Department.

01:13:26.565 --> 01:13:29.840
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- Okay.

01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:41.724
Does this look familiar to you?

01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:48.219
It's a witch bottle.

01:13:48.319 --> 01:13:50.422
Do you have any idea who could have made it?

01:13:50.522 --> 01:13:53.363
No. No, I don't.

01:13:55.493 --> 01:13:57.863
Ever seen any of these in here before?

01:13:57.963 --> 01:14:00.066
Yeah, we have some witch bottles.

01:14:00.166 --> 01:14:01.973
I'll show you one.

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.781
Here's one.

01:14:13.478 --> 01:14:15.381
How common are these bottles?

01:14:15.481 --> 01:14:20.419
I've never seen 'em in here before
until a girl started supplying 'em to us.

01:14:20.752 --> 01:14:22.827
Who is this girl?

01:14:23.888 --> 01:14:27.331
Her name is Elaine, Elaine Parks.

01:14:54.051 --> 01:14:55.859
Who is it?

01:14:56.621 --> 01:14:59.097
Sergeant Meadows, Police Department.

01:15:05.062 --> 01:15:07.399
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,
but I'm investigating a case...

01:15:07.499 --> 01:15:10.169
...and I just wanted to ask you
a few questions.

01:15:10.269 --> 01:15:11.973
About what?

01:15:12.073 --> 01:15:14.506
Well, it's a potential homicide case.

01:15:14.606 --> 01:15:16.542
Just a routine check.

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:18.878
I thought you might be able to help us.

01:15:20.278 --> 01:15:22.119
Of course.

01:15:23.514 --> 01:15:26.390
Please come in, Sergeant.

01:15:32.623 --> 01:15:34.973
So you say there was a homicide.

01:15:35.593 --> 01:15:37.467
How horrible.

01:15:37.762 --> 01:15:42.000
- Who was killed?
- A man named Wayne Peters.

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:44.622
- Did you know Wayne Peters?
- No.

01:15:48.205 --> 01:15:51.076
Here's a picture of him.
Ever seen him before?

01:15:51.176 --> 01:15:54.313
No. I guess I can't help you, Sergeant.

01:15:54.413 --> 01:15:57.821
- Good bye.
- Ms. Parks, wait.

01:16:04.655 --> 01:16:07.632
Have you ever seen anything like this before?

01:16:07.859 --> 01:16:11.497
It's a magic bottle. I made it myself.

01:16:12.302 --> 01:16:15.000
Have you ever seen one containing urine?

01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:16.841
Urine?

01:16:17.902 --> 01:16:19.443
No.

01:16:29.747 --> 01:16:32.942
We found this bottle containing urine...

01:16:33.042 --> 01:16:35.100
...and a used tampon...

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.214
...on the grave of Wayne Peters.

01:16:39.158 --> 01:16:42.200
Will you excuse me for a moment, Sergeant?

01:16:48.366 --> 01:16:51.102
Ms. Parks, are you a witch?

01:16:51.202 --> 01:16:54.740
Yes, I am. Is there a law against that?

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.577
I guess not, not unless
you do something wrong.

01:16:58.677 --> 01:17:01.379
Do you think that being
a witch makes me evil...

01:17:01.479 --> 01:17:03.498
...capable of murder even?

01:17:03.598 --> 01:17:06.352
No, I wasn't trying to imply...

01:17:06.452 --> 01:17:08.329
Sergeant Meadows...

01:17:08.929 --> 01:17:12.209
...do you know
what it's like to really suffer?

01:17:12.608 --> 01:17:16.814
You have to fight and fight
until you're too exhausted to go on.

01:17:17.263 --> 01:17:20.766
Witchcraft is my religion, Sergeant.

01:17:20.866 --> 01:17:25.003
And this religion, which is older
than your Christianity...

01:17:25.103 --> 01:17:27.111
...saved my life.

01:17:40.885 --> 01:17:42.594
Ms. Parks...

01:17:43.272 --> 01:17:45.479
...I'm sorry if I've offended you.

01:17:47.024 --> 01:17:48.866
I didn't realize.

01:17:51.896 --> 01:17:54.430
That's all right, Sergeant...

01:17:55.599 --> 01:17:57.251
...Meadow.

01:18:00.205 --> 01:18:02.393
You can call me Griff.

01:18:03.641 --> 01:18:05.282
Griff?

01:18:07.646 --> 01:18:10.457
I know I've seen you before.

01:18:11.882 --> 01:18:14.091
I just don't know where.

01:18:14.919 --> 01:18:16.922
I have that same feeling.

01:18:17.822 --> 01:18:19.663
I know.

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:25.303
You're the man in the cards.

01:18:26.731 --> 01:18:28.605
You're my fate.

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:31.704
What do you mean, I'm your fate?

01:18:32.304 --> 01:18:34.646
I did a Celtic cross reading.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:38.970
For my future card I got knight of wands.

01:18:40.778 --> 01:18:44.442
Always felt that if that card
showed up in a future reading...

01:18:44.867 --> 01:18:47.411
...soon meet the man that I'm going to marry.

01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:51.293
But the man that I marry has to love animals.

01:18:52.724 --> 01:18:54.993
Do you like animals, Griff?

01:18:55.093 --> 01:18:58.067
Why yes, I love animals.

01:18:58.167 --> 01:19:01.320
In fact, a friend of mine has
a couple horses I'm very fond of.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.000
You know, tomorrow is my day off...

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:06.973
...and it's supposed to be quite nice out.

01:19:08.173 --> 01:19:11.244
Maybe I'll get away from the city
and do some riding.

01:19:12.344 --> 01:19:15.185
Do you like to ride, Elaine?

01:20:09.710 --> 01:20:11.339
Patchouli...

01:20:11.975 --> 01:20:13.828
...you're such a sweetheart.

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.022
How's my girl?

01:20:25.316 --> 01:20:27.084
Am I your girl?

01:20:27.184 --> 01:20:29.060
For today you are.

01:20:30.187 --> 01:20:33.697
You're my girl and there's nobody
around to tell me otherwise.

01:20:35.259 --> 01:20:37.140
Except me.

01:20:37.395 --> 01:20:39.664
And what's that supposed to mean?

01:20:40.952 --> 01:20:42.606
Nothing.

01:20:43.114 --> 01:20:44.979
Kiss me.

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:57.749
What's that sound?

01:20:58.249 --> 01:21:01.258
I don't know. Let's go see.

01:22:23.835 --> 01:22:27.178
Now is the time of the summer solstice.

01:22:27.717 --> 01:22:30.809
The strength of the Oak King is waning.

01:22:30.909 --> 01:22:34.012
And the Holly King stands ready
to challenge him...

01:22:34.112 --> 01:22:36.654
...for the hand of the Green Maiden.

01:22:38.582 --> 01:22:40.691
Let the battle begin.

01:22:46.057 --> 01:22:49.166
- Your season is over, old man.
- Never.

01:22:56.433 --> 01:22:59.471
- I will have her.
- Never have her.

01:23:00.371 --> 01:23:01.986
Never.

01:23:05.077 --> 01:23:07.292
Holly King, I name you the victor.

01:23:07.612 --> 01:23:10.954
- The Green Maiden is yours.
- M'lady.

01:23:12.484 --> 01:23:14.324
Come on.

01:23:19.623 --> 01:23:21.264
Elaine.

01:23:21.525 --> 01:23:24.496
- You know these people?
- Well, yes, in a way.

01:23:24.596 --> 01:23:29.067
All hail, fair lord and lady.
Welcome to our little gathering.

01:23:29.167 --> 01:23:30.966
All hail.

01:23:31.235 --> 01:23:34.657
We are the good people of
the renaissance and medieval players...

01:23:34.757 --> 01:23:37.142
...and we are celebrating the mid-summer.

01:23:37.242 --> 01:23:38.810
Won't you join us?

01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:41.818
To be sure, fair consort.

01:23:48.686 --> 01:23:52.629
- They are charming, are they not?
- Yes, quite charming.

01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:55.293
I see two people in love.

01:23:55.393 --> 01:23:57.562
This calls for a wedding.

01:23:57.862 --> 01:24:00.799
- A wedding?
- Yes, a mock wedding, if you will.

01:24:00.899 --> 01:24:04.373
To honor the Gods of love.

01:24:11.042 --> 01:24:15.310
<i>Love is a magical thing</i>

01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:19.378
<i>Love will make you feel
like a queen or a king</i>

01:24:19.778 --> 01:24:23.699
<i>Unicorns, rainbows, lucky charms</i>

01:24:23.799 --> 01:24:29.000
<i>Await you in your true love's arms</i>

01:24:30.889 --> 01:24:35.046
<i>Love is a magical thing</i>

01:24:35.146 --> 01:24:38.885
<i>Mystical, physical, alchemical</i>

01:24:39.235 --> 01:24:43.366
<i>We're pretending to be in love today</i>

01:24:43.616 --> 01:24:48.174
<i>But pretending is also real</i>

01:24:50.408 --> 01:24:53.887
<i>There's a lady in a castle</i>

01:24:53.987 --> 01:24:56.784
<i>She's sad and so forlorn</i>

01:24:57.174 --> 01:25:00.572
<i>When her troubadour returns and kisses her</i>

01:25:00.872 --> 01:25:04.155
<i>She's all smiles and laughter</i>

01:25:04.255 --> 01:25:07.221
<i>Lady, you're so beautiful</i>

01:25:07.321 --> 01:25:10.586
<i>Come lie with me and be my love</i>

01:25:10.686 --> 01:25:14.221
<i>I'd slay any dragon, endure any danger</i>

01:25:14.321 --> 01:25:18.872
<i>Just to have you near me</i>

01:25:19.505 --> 01:25:23.574
<i>Love is a magical thing</i>

01:25:23.894 --> 01:25:27.998
<i>Lucky lovers mate in the spring</i>

01:25:28.098 --> 01:25:32.007
<i>We sip from goblets full of joy</i>

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:34.334
<i>But when love dies</i>

01:25:34.434 --> 01:25:40.002
<i>All life it does destroy</i>

01:26:04.857 --> 01:26:06.497
Okay.

01:27:28.422 --> 01:27:30.630
Now, ye are wed.

01:27:37.048 --> 01:27:40.553
I'm so happy for you, Elaine, he's adorable.

01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:15.053
<i>I'm not in love.</i>

01:28:15.153 --> 01:28:18.756
<i>It's not that I don't have sentiment,
it's just that love is soft.</i>

01:28:18.856 --> 01:28:20.925
<i>You need guts in this business.</i>

01:28:21.025 --> 01:28:25.662
<i>I've seen guys get shot to death because
they fell in love and got soft inside.</i>

01:28:25.762 --> 01:28:29.033
<i>I want an heir some day and then
I would need to have a wife...</i>

01:28:29.133 --> 01:28:31.436
<i>...but love is something else.</i>

01:28:31.536 --> 01:28:33.971
<i>A man can get destroyed by things like that.</i>

01:28:34.071 --> 01:28:36.441
<i>It's like he's not even a man anymore.</i>

01:28:36.541 --> 01:28:38.715
<i>I never wanna get that way.</i>

01:28:39.876 --> 01:28:42.180
<i>When you really love him...</i>

01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:46.851
<i>...it's like fireworks
and nothing else matters.</i>

01:28:46.951 --> 01:28:49.454
<i>You love all the little quirks about him.</i>

01:28:49.854 --> 01:28:52.262
<i>The way he slurps his cereal.</i>

01:28:52.623 --> 01:28:54.826
<i>The way his mouth is a little crooked.</i>

01:28:54.926 --> 01:28:58.997
<i>Those details about him
become your whole life.</i>

01:28:59.097 --> 01:29:03.400
<i>Something inside you
opens up like a flower...</i>

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:06.971
<i>...and you realize that you
have more love to give...</i>

01:29:07.071 --> 01:29:10.040
<i>...than you ever thought was possible.</i>

01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:12.849
<i>'Cause the more you know him...</i>

01:29:13.944 --> 01:29:16.186
<i>...the more you love him.</i>

01:29:17.047 --> 01:29:21.019
<i>The more you get to know a woman,
the less you can feel about her.</i>

01:29:21.619 --> 01:29:23.721
<i>At first, she's this
incredible object of mystery...</i>

01:29:23.821 --> 01:29:26.658
<i>...who fulfills all you're wildest fantasies.</i>

01:29:27.658 --> 01:29:30.328
<i>Then she starts to reveal little flaws...</i>

01:29:30.728 --> 01:29:34.265
<i>...and after a while,
just gets pretty hard to care.</i>

01:29:35.165 --> 01:29:38.441
<i>Feminine ideal only exists in a man's mind.</i>

01:29:38.969 --> 01:29:41.235
<i>No woman could ever fulfill it.</i>

01:29:41.673 --> 01:29:45.217
<i>And sometimes,
when she tries to love you more...</i>

01:29:45.317 --> 01:29:47.285
<i>...give you more...</i>

01:29:47.885 --> 01:29:50.168
<i>...you feel like you're suffocating...</i>

01:29:50.268 --> 01:29:52.455
<i>...drowning in estrogen.</i>

01:29:53.417 --> 01:29:55.459
<i>The most awful feeling.</i>

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:05.669
Dinner tonight, Griff?

01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:09.105
Can't tonight, Connie.

01:30:10.166 --> 01:30:12.008
Some other time.

01:30:17.441 --> 01:30:20.145
Hey, Griff, I got more information
on that Elaine Parks girl.

01:30:20.245 --> 01:30:22.380
You leave it on my desk.

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:25.032
- Don't you wanna hear it?
- Steve...

01:30:25.132 --> 01:30:28.868
- Captain wants us to lay off the case.
- Are you serious?

01:30:29.268 --> 01:30:32.223
He says we have a policy
of leaving the witches alone.

01:30:32.323 --> 01:30:34.659
He says they've lived
in this town a long time...

01:30:34.759 --> 01:30:38.435
- ...and he doesn't like to mess with them.
- Even if they murder.

01:30:39.629 --> 01:30:42.483
He says he's satisfied that Wayne's
death was a heart attack.

01:30:43.233 --> 01:30:45.074
I think so too.

01:30:48.205 --> 01:30:50.642
Has everyone gone crazy around here?

01:30:50.742 --> 01:30:53.417
Let me at least tell you what I found.

01:30:58.849 --> 01:31:01.619
Now, Elaine used to run
an organic beauty store...

01:31:01.719 --> 01:31:03.754
...in Berkeley with her husband, Jerry.

01:31:03.854 --> 01:31:06.991
Two years later they were divorced
and Elaine moved to San Francisco...

01:31:07.091 --> 01:31:11.577
...to start dancing at a burlesque club
where she got involved with a witch coven.

01:31:20.103 --> 01:31:24.876
The coven broke up after police questioning
when some of it's members died mysteriously.

01:31:24.976 --> 01:31:29.714
Soon after, Elaine's ex-husband
died of a drug overdose...

01:31:29.814 --> 01:31:32.796
...shortly before he was planning to remarry.

01:31:33.418 --> 01:31:37.332
The police questioned Elaine but they
couldn't find enough to hold her.

01:31:37.755 --> 01:31:40.558
Well, if the San Francisco police
couldn't find anything...

01:31:40.658 --> 01:31:42.527
...what happened there
is none of our business.

01:31:42.627 --> 01:31:47.112
Are you serious? I'd say this woman
is a dangerous character...

01:31:47.212 --> 01:31:49.275
...and you better watch her.

01:31:49.375 --> 01:31:53.004
You mean because she's a witch?
That doesn't mean anything.

01:31:53.104 --> 01:31:57.306
No, her husband died of a drug
he'd never taken before.

01:31:57.406 --> 01:32:00.750
And did you ever find where
Wayne Peters got the devil's weed?

01:32:01.512 --> 01:32:03.881
I questioned Ms. Curtis about that.

01:32:03.981 --> 01:32:06.751
There was devil's weed
growing near his cabin.

01:32:06.851 --> 01:32:09.267
Apparently, he experimented often with drugs.

01:32:09.367 --> 01:32:11.589
Come on, Griff, can't you connect the dots?

01:32:11.689 --> 01:32:15.527
We have a possible murder here
and Elaine is our only suspect.

01:32:15.627 --> 01:32:18.146
I told you, we're laying off her.

01:32:18.246 --> 01:32:20.648
Because of orders
or because you're in love with her?

01:32:20.748 --> 01:32:23.917
Who says I'm in love with her?
Get the hell off my back.

01:32:28.939 --> 01:32:32.509
You're out of line, Griff, way out of line.

01:33:07.645 --> 01:33:09.285
Richard.

01:33:11.265 --> 01:33:12.905
Richard!

01:33:13.618 --> 01:33:15.185
Richard!

01:33:15.285 --> 01:33:16.926
Richard!

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:05.370
Thank you for meeting me, Elaine.

01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:07.872
It's not good for me to be alone too much.

01:34:08.472 --> 01:34:12.983
- I know you're busy.
- Of course. I wanted to come.

01:34:15.178 --> 01:34:18.369
I can't help but blaming myself
for what happened.

01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:21.518
You can't blame yourself.

01:34:21.618 --> 01:34:25.029
You were a good wife to Richard.

01:34:25.889 --> 01:34:27.730
I tried to be.

01:34:29.693 --> 01:34:32.102
I tried so hard to please him...

01:34:32.863 --> 01:34:35.132
...but I should have tried harder.

01:34:35.232 --> 01:34:37.761
He wanted a certain type of woman...

01:34:38.261 --> 01:34:40.456
...someone I could never be.

01:34:41.905 --> 01:34:43.947
Maybe you were right.

01:34:44.574 --> 01:34:47.417
Maybe you should give a man his fantasy.

01:34:49.212 --> 01:34:52.297
I thought that was so awful
when you said that.

01:34:53.583 --> 01:34:55.920
Maybe I was being naive...

01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:59.142
...but I really thought he loved me for me.

01:35:00.757 --> 01:35:02.588
But now...

01:35:03.623 --> 01:35:05.884
...now I wish...

01:35:07.230 --> 01:35:10.234
You have to stop torturing yourself.

01:35:10.934 --> 01:35:12.981
You have to let go.

01:35:13.381 --> 01:35:16.441
Remember how he changed after my Dallas trip?

01:35:17.241 --> 01:35:20.116
I think that's when he started
having that affair.

01:35:20.645 --> 01:35:23.296
Whoever she was she drove him crazy.

01:35:24.915 --> 01:35:27.951
I hated him so much for that.

01:35:28.251 --> 01:35:30.324
I wanted to kill them both.

01:35:31.188 --> 01:35:35.163
If I ever found out who she was,
I would rip her to pieces.

01:35:35.826 --> 01:35:38.569
But now I see I should have helped him.

01:35:39.797 --> 01:35:42.675
I didn't know that he was going to...

01:35:43.294 --> 01:35:45.535
...take his own life.

01:35:51.407 --> 01:35:53.216
Enough about me.

01:35:54.010 --> 01:35:55.796
What's going on with you?

01:35:56.146 --> 01:35:57.791
Trish...

01:35:58.738 --> 01:36:00.569
I'm in love.

01:36:01.317 --> 01:36:04.449
- Who is he?
- He's a detective...

01:36:04.549 --> 01:36:08.598
...and he's everything
a woman could ever want.

01:36:09.192 --> 01:36:12.372
He's strong and handsome...

01:36:12.472 --> 01:36:14.635
...smart and kind.

01:36:15.298 --> 01:36:17.707
I just know that he's the one.

01:36:18.802 --> 01:36:21.071
He even gave me this ring.

01:36:21.171 --> 01:36:23.391
I call it my magic ring.

01:36:24.107 --> 01:36:26.571
It's not an engagement ring but...

01:36:26.671 --> 01:36:31.086
...I just know that he's gonna
pop the question soon.

01:36:44.995 --> 01:36:48.778
When we first came here I showed you
my engagement ring, remember?

01:36:51.868 --> 01:36:55.478
I can barely stand to look
at it anymore. It's too painful.

01:36:57.507 --> 01:36:59.711
I'm sure he's going to ask you soon.

01:37:00.311 --> 01:37:02.614
You're going to make a beautiful bride.

01:37:03.914 --> 01:37:06.122
The first day we met...

01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:11.755
...you were envious of me because
I had a man and you were all alone.

01:37:12.655 --> 01:37:14.731
Now it's the reverse.

01:37:16.242 --> 01:37:18.171
Life is funny, isn't it?

01:37:20.764 --> 01:37:23.140
Trish, I'm sorry, I've gotta go.

01:37:23.567 --> 01:37:25.529
Would you like to walk out with me?

01:37:27.037 --> 01:37:29.874
No, I'd like to stay and finish my tea.

01:37:30.174 --> 01:37:31.781
All right.

01:37:34.477 --> 01:37:36.319
Take care, love.

01:38:16.586 --> 01:38:20.291
Hi, Elaine, it's me.
Yeah, you left your ring here.

01:38:20.391 --> 01:38:23.661
You're probably driving
but I'll drop it by on my way home.

01:38:23.761 --> 01:38:25.635
See you in a minute.

01:43:48.518 --> 01:43:50.374
You bitch.

01:43:51.788 --> 01:43:53.749
You killed my husband.

01:43:57.993 --> 01:44:02.099
Bitch, skank, whore.

01:44:13.977 --> 01:44:16.018
You'll burn for this.

01:44:25.622 --> 01:44:28.764
Crash, crash, crash.

01:44:29.358 --> 01:44:33.621
Die, die, die.

01:45:22.245 --> 01:45:25.431
Habondia, bind these two...

01:45:25.531 --> 01:45:27.668
...with a heady lovers' brew.

01:45:28.418 --> 01:45:31.121
Even should they strive to flee...

01:45:31.221 --> 01:45:34.229
...they'll cling for all eternity.

01:45:45.535 --> 01:45:47.175
Scotch.

01:46:03.402 --> 01:46:05.244
Bottle o' beer, Sam.

01:46:12.095 --> 01:46:14.130
Who are those new girls?

01:46:14.530 --> 01:46:16.606
They can't dance at all.

01:46:16.833 --> 01:46:18.707
And they're weird.

01:46:23.439 --> 01:46:26.492
I don't know,
but the customers really like 'em.

01:46:27.810 --> 01:46:31.682
They're friends of the witches.
I seen them come in together before.

01:46:31.782 --> 01:46:34.856
Yeah, the witches.

01:46:35.784 --> 01:46:37.259
They're everywhere.

01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:40.321
- One gin and tonic, Sam.
- Gin and tonic coming up.

01:46:41.357 --> 01:46:44.862
Did you read about the teacher
buried in the back yard of his cabin?

01:46:44.962 --> 01:46:46.931
They said it was dug by the witches.

01:46:47.331 --> 01:46:51.735
Yeah, I read about that. They found all
sorts of witchcraft things on the grave.

01:46:51.835 --> 01:46:53.954
Yeah, I heard about that, too.

01:46:54.404 --> 01:46:56.044
Creepy.

01:47:13.190 --> 01:47:15.064
Sit down, Elaine.

01:47:22.331 --> 01:47:26.374
Elaine, the DNA came back from the lab.

01:47:27.837 --> 01:47:30.058
It connects you with Wayne Peters.

01:47:33.143 --> 01:47:37.453
Patricia Manning came by the station.
Some things of yours.

01:47:39.515 --> 01:47:41.356
Including this.

01:47:42.918 --> 01:47:46.129
She said you drove her husband to suicide.

01:47:50.159 --> 01:47:52.228
So I was a bad girl.

01:47:52.528 --> 01:47:54.604
Are you going to punish me?

01:47:56.732 --> 01:47:59.009
What sort of person are you, Elaine?

01:47:59.803 --> 01:48:03.407
What sort of sick mind would do such things?

01:48:03.507 --> 01:48:05.809
Why are you so negative?

01:48:05.909 --> 01:48:07.911
I didn't kill anyone.

01:48:08.311 --> 01:48:10.947
Wayne died of heart failure...

01:48:11.047 --> 01:48:13.984
...after a beautiful night of lovemaking.

01:48:14.684 --> 01:48:18.555
And Richard died
because he loved me too much.

01:48:18.655 --> 01:48:21.364
These men weren't used
to the deep feelings of love...

01:48:21.464 --> 01:48:23.584
...that they were experiencing with me.

01:48:23.684 --> 01:48:26.496
Are you saying these men died of love?

01:48:26.596 --> 01:48:30.634
That's insane.
What about the spells and the drugs?

01:48:31.402 --> 01:48:34.104
Are you saying witchcraft
had nothing to do with it?

01:48:34.204 --> 01:48:38.041
Witchcraft is just a way
of concentrating energy.

01:48:38.441 --> 01:48:40.918
It can only work with what's already there.

01:48:41.218 --> 01:48:44.381
I just use sex magic to create love magic.

01:48:44.481 --> 01:48:47.340
I didn't know how strong the spells would be.

01:48:48.285 --> 01:48:51.172
Sometimes it's almost scary
how strong the love gets.

01:48:51.421 --> 01:48:53.061
Love?

01:48:54.122 --> 01:48:56.165
What do you know about love?

01:48:56.593 --> 01:49:00.764
What you call love is a borderline
personality disorder.

01:49:01.564 --> 01:49:03.099
Or worse.

01:49:03.199 --> 01:49:05.074
Don't diagnose me.

01:49:05.718 --> 01:49:08.895
Maybe you're a narcissist who can't love.

01:49:10.206 --> 01:49:12.375
You think that I'm sick...

01:49:12.475 --> 01:49:14.912
...because you've never loved like I have.

01:49:16.012 --> 01:49:19.414
Well, I would do anything for love.

01:49:20.483 --> 01:49:24.452
That's right, you'll never get enough love.

01:49:25.354 --> 01:49:28.492
Even when a man loves you
so much it kills him...

01:49:28.592 --> 01:49:32.396
...it's not enough for you.
You're like a bottomless hole.

01:49:33.196 --> 01:49:36.928
You doll yourself up and do
the Stepford wife thing...

01:49:37.028 --> 01:49:40.604
...thinking every man is going
to fall at your feet.

01:49:40.704 --> 01:49:44.324
But your creepy little sexy act...

01:49:44.424 --> 01:49:46.274
...doesn't work with me.

01:49:47.610 --> 01:49:49.418
I don't love you.

01:49:55.317 --> 01:49:59.481
How can you stand there and boast
about being immune to love?

01:50:00.023 --> 01:50:04.100
Why does the genuine love
of a woman scare you so much?

01:50:04.728 --> 01:50:08.065
You think that your way
is a superior way to live?

01:50:08.165 --> 01:50:10.767
I know a lot of women
who feel the way that I do.

01:50:11.267 --> 01:50:15.655
Only men make us work so hard for your love.

01:50:16.539 --> 01:50:18.599
If you would just...

01:50:18.699 --> 01:50:21.072
...love us for ourselves...

01:50:23.078 --> 01:50:24.753
...but you won't.

01:50:25.748 --> 01:50:28.649
My ex-husband was just like you.

01:50:29.285 --> 01:50:32.462
He used to punish me
by withholding his love from me.

01:50:33.957 --> 01:50:38.361
All my life I've been tossed
in the garbage...

01:50:38.461 --> 01:50:41.889
...except when men wanted to use my body.

01:50:43.165 --> 01:50:46.264
So, I decided to find my own power.

01:50:46.936 --> 01:50:50.013
And I found that power through witchcraft.

01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:54.311
That means that I take
what I need from men...

01:50:54.411 --> 01:50:56.688
...and not the other way around.

01:50:59.615 --> 01:51:01.690
I'm sorry, Elaine.

01:51:03.836 --> 01:51:05.845
It won't work this time.

01:51:06.989 --> 01:51:09.759
I'm afraid I'm going to have to arrest you.

01:51:09.859 --> 01:51:11.666
What for?

01:51:12.395 --> 01:51:14.932
Marrying a lover according to my religion?

01:51:15.582 --> 01:51:17.590
Seducing a married man?

01:51:18.567 --> 01:51:22.535
I know 400 years ago you could
be burned for a thing like that...

01:51:22.635 --> 01:51:24.574
...but not today.

01:51:26.942 --> 01:51:30.150
No, not burned...

01:51:31.563 --> 01:51:34.948
...but you'll be booked for burying
Wayne Peters illegally.

01:51:36.918 --> 01:51:39.077
And we'll find out more.

01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:43.799
That's the witch who killed the teacher.

01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:47.597
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

01:51:52.736 --> 01:51:54.839
- Burn the witch.
- Burn the witch.

01:51:54.939 --> 01:51:58.399
Burn the witch, burn the witch,
burn the witch.

01:51:58.499 --> 01:52:03.008
Burn the witch, burn the witch,
burn the witch, burn the witch.

01:52:49.793 --> 01:52:52.633
- Burn her!
- Burn.

01:53:16.652 --> 01:53:18.228
Poor baby.

01:53:18.954 --> 01:53:21.796
Poor, poor baby.

01:53:26.295 --> 01:53:30.705
Don't worry, everything will be okay...

01:53:31.667 --> 01:53:35.542
...because I love you so much.

01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:06.501
I love you, Elaine.

01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:09.671
I love you, Elaine.

01:55:11.033 --> 01:55:12.874
I love you, Elaine.

01:56:24.023 --> 01:56:25.898
I love you, Elaine.

01:56:27.259 --> 01:56:29.689
I've never loved anyone but you.

01:56:30.679 --> 01:56:32.754
I want to marry you.
