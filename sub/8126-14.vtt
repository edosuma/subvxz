00:54.319 --> 00:57.421
Michael, for heaven's sakes,
will you relax?
This is a celebration.

00:57.489 --> 01:00.759
Some celebration.
We've been waiting for over
half an hour for your father.

01:00.826 --> 01:05.030
There he is!
Here we are, Archie!
I see you there, Edith.

01:05.096 --> 01:09.034
Geez. How's a guy supposed
to find this dump, huh?

01:09.101 --> 01:11.736
I've been wandering
around the neighborhood
for an hour.

01:11.804 --> 01:16.675
Daddy, we gave you the address,
and besides, Michael told you
just ask anyone for pasquale's.

01:16.742 --> 01:20.444
I did ask for pasquale's.
A guy takes me
into a little joint.

01:20.512 --> 01:24.382
Another guy tries
to half-sole my shoes.

01:24.449 --> 01:30.121
All right, daddy. I admit this
isn't the fanciest restaurant
in town, but it's our treat.

01:30.189 --> 01:34.225
Oh, gee. Yeah, that's right.
You kids are springin'
for the tab.

01:34.293 --> 01:37.996
You sure
you got enough money
there, meathead?

01:38.064 --> 01:43.434
I mean, dinner for four
in a palace like this
could cost maybe a buck.

01:43.502 --> 01:47.972
Will you lay off, arch? It's
ma's birthday. Can't you have
some respect for the occasion?

01:48.040 --> 01:51.976
Come on. Edith and me,
we never make no to-do
about birthdays.

01:52.044 --> 01:55.213
A birthday's just the same
as any other day in the year,
right, Edith?

01:55.280 --> 01:59.317
Well, almost.
What do you mean
"almost"?

01:59.384 --> 02:02.787
I always remember
your birthday, Archie.

02:02.855 --> 02:05.190
Well,
I remembered yours.
You did?

02:05.257 --> 02:10.228
Certainly. I picked up the
morning paper, there was the
date there, and I remembered.

02:11.663 --> 02:14.933
Thank you, Archie.
That was very sweet
of you.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.336
You don't have
to slobber me.

02:18.403 --> 02:21.005
Daddy, don't you think
you oughta propose a toast?

02:21.073 --> 02:25.910
- A toast? For what?
- For mom for her birthday.

02:25.978 --> 02:28.713
That would be nice,
Archie.
I told you before.

02:28.781 --> 02:32.183
Your mother and me don't make
no fuss about birthdays.
And can't we eat here?

02:32.251 --> 02:36.287
Hey, waiter, could we
have a menu over here?
Before I read the menu,

02:36.355 --> 02:40.959
Mrs. bellini wrote down
what I should order
in an Italian restaurant.

02:41.026 --> 02:43.895
Here it is:
Veal "scalo-piney."

02:43.963 --> 02:49.033
Edith, is this
my insurance payment here?

02:49.101 --> 02:52.303
Oh, yeah.
I must have forgot
to mail it.

02:52.371 --> 02:55.439
How could you forget?
I gave it to you
three days ago to mail.

02:55.507 --> 02:58.709
- Well, she can mail it
tomorrow, daddy.
- Tomorrow's no good.

02:58.778 --> 03:02.413
- The premium payment
is due in here today.
- What are you worried about?

03:02.481 --> 03:07.518
-Every policy has a grace
period. They give you 30 days.
-This is the 30th day, meathead.

03:07.586 --> 03:12.157
Don't you know that
insurance companies live
to cancel out guys like me?

03:12.224 --> 03:14.292
What time is it? Lookit.
It's quarter to 6:00.

03:14.359 --> 03:17.361
It's a good thing the Friedman
building is only five blocks
from here. I'm gonna hustle...

03:17.429 --> 03:19.363
Over and shove it
under the office door.

03:19.431 --> 03:21.565
Daddy, think
of mom. You're gonna
ruin her whole birthday.

03:21.633 --> 03:25.736
She ruined it herself
by not mailing this thing!
I'm sorry.

03:25.805 --> 03:29.440
Archie's unbelievable.
His wife's birthday.

03:29.508 --> 03:34.112
- He doesn't have one ounce
of sentiment about it.
- Archie has lots of sentiment.

03:34.180 --> 03:37.682
You just gotta know
where to look for it.

04:14.553 --> 04:18.589
- Eight, please.
- Yeah. So long as I'm going
to eight myself.

04:18.656 --> 04:21.559
[ Woman ]
Wait, please! Hold it!
I'm coming on!

04:21.625 --> 04:25.096
Ah, let her get another car.
Close those doors.
We're in a hurry.

04:25.164 --> 04:28.699
Oh, thank you so much.
I hope I didn't
hold you people up.

04:28.767 --> 04:32.237
This is the slowest elevator
in New York. I would've had
to wait an hour.

04:32.304 --> 04:35.573
[ Archie ]
Well, you didn't make it
no faster just now.

04:37.776 --> 04:41.412
Oh, has this
been a day, I tell you.
Nothing's gone right.

04:41.480 --> 04:45.616
This elevator's the first thing
I've caught all day. When
I left the house this morning,

04:45.684 --> 04:48.386
I stubbed my toe
and I couldn't run,
so I missed the bus.

04:48.453 --> 04:52.757
When I was in the ladies' room,
my boss left for the day,
so I missed getting paid.

04:52.824 --> 04:57.362
- Would you press four, please?
- Lady, we just passed five.

04:57.429 --> 05:01.465
Today's a wipeout
for you, ain't it?

05:01.533 --> 05:06.170
Well,
let me out at six.
[ Woman shouting in Spanish ]

05:06.238 --> 05:08.373
[ Man responding
in Spanish ]
What happened?

05:08.440 --> 05:12.476
It would appear
the elevator has stopped.

05:19.718 --> 05:23.388
You figured that out,
huh?

05:23.455 --> 05:28.927
What are we gonna do?
Take it easy, now. Let me try
some of these buttons over here,

05:28.994 --> 05:31.262
see if we can make it move.

05:31.330 --> 05:33.998
No. No. Let's see.
This, this, this.

05:34.066 --> 05:39.037
No. Nothing. No action.
Well, it looks like
the elevator is stuck.

05:39.104 --> 05:42.040
You figured that out, eh?

05:43.642 --> 05:46.844
<i>You mean that we're</i>
<i>trapped between floors?</i>

05:46.912 --> 05:51.182
[ Conversing in Spanish ]
What are we gonna do? I wish I'd
never come into this elevator.

05:51.250 --> 05:54.685
Well, so do I, lady. It was him
forcing that door open for you
that caused it.

05:54.753 --> 05:57.922
- I didn't touch those doors.
He opened the doors.
- Yeah, well him or somebody...

05:57.990 --> 06:00.591
Opened 'em, anyhow.
[ Speaking Spanish ]

06:00.659 --> 06:03.928
Tell 'em to put a lid on that
Spanish back there, will ya?
It's makin' me nervous.

06:03.996 --> 06:07.631
They come here to live;
You'd think they'd learn
our language and our customs.

06:16.008 --> 06:19.310
Well, why don't you tell 'em
about it? You speak their lingo,
don't ya?

06:19.378 --> 06:21.946
What makes you think
I speak their lingo?

06:22.014 --> 06:24.782
Well, I figured you'd learn
some of it livin' up in Harlem.

06:24.850 --> 06:28.519
- What makes you think
I live in Harlem?
- You look it.

06:30.755 --> 06:33.024
What makes you think?

06:40.165 --> 06:44.235
Look. What are we gonna do?
I mean, isn't anybody
gonna get us out of here?

06:44.303 --> 06:46.770
There's usually a telephone
in these things. Open
that little door on your side.

06:46.838 --> 06:49.440
All right. Just let me
handle everything, will ya?

06:49.508 --> 06:54.078
There's usually a telephone
in these things. I'll just open
this little door over here...

06:54.146 --> 06:56.680
And find out.

06:56.748 --> 06:58.682
Just as I thought.
Here it is.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.885
Senor.
Yeah. Operator?

07:00.952 --> 07:03.988
Senor.
Operator?
Get off my back there,
will ya, "pee-dro"?

07:04.056 --> 07:06.391
I'm tryin'
to call somebody.

07:06.458 --> 07:11.896
Senor. Senor.
"Pee-dro."
Hey, can somebody translate
what I'm sayin' for this spick?

07:14.333 --> 07:18.202
Is not necessary, mister.
This, uh, "spick,"
uh, speak English.

07:18.270 --> 07:22.640
Well, then,
you oughta know I'm tryin'
to call the operator here.

07:22.707 --> 07:25.176
Operator?
I tried to tell you
there is no operator.

07:25.244 --> 07:27.445
The telephone rings
only in the janitor's room.

07:27.513 --> 07:32.083
Well, the janitor's the guy
I'm tryin' to get ahold of.
I am the janitor.

07:36.288 --> 07:39.823
So you are the janitor,
are you?
Yes. Carlos mendoza.

07:39.891 --> 07:42.927
This is my wife,
serafina. [ Spanish ]
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

07:42.994 --> 07:46.364
- Hey. You're gonna have a baby.
- You noticed.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.102
[ Speaking Spanish ]

07:51.170 --> 07:55.373
Do you have baby too?
Ah! [ Grumbles, indistinct ]

07:55.441 --> 07:59.210
Tell your wife
to can the comedy, huh?
I'm angelique McCarthy.

07:59.278 --> 08:02.413
How do you do?
Listen, sis. This ain't
a cocktail party here.

08:02.481 --> 08:05.883
- Forget the introductions,
will you?
- I'm fond of introductions.

08:05.951 --> 08:08.686
- My name is
Hugh Victor Thompson III.
- How do you do?

08:08.753 --> 08:10.688
How do you do?
[ Angelique ]
Hello.

08:10.755 --> 08:12.957
And you?
What's your name?
I ain't
gonna tell you my name.

08:13.024 --> 08:16.927
Why? Is it a funny name?

08:16.995 --> 08:20.198
No, it ain't a funny name.
It's a name right out
of American history.

08:20.265 --> 08:24.335
- Bunker, as in the "battle of."
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. bunker hill.

08:24.403 --> 08:27.938
No, it ain't that neither.
It's just plain bunker.

08:28.006 --> 08:31.709
Now, come on. Let's cut out
the social "manunities"
here, huh?

08:31.776 --> 08:36.013
Hey, come on. You're
the janitor around here. Can't
you do something to help us out?

08:36.081 --> 08:39.517
Oh, yes, yes.
I think there is one thing
that I can think to do.

08:39.585 --> 08:44.121
Well, come on. Do it.

08:44.188 --> 08:48.025
-Our father, who art in heaven--
-I don't mean that!
Come on.

08:48.093 --> 08:50.694
Please. Let me
explain something to you,
please.

08:50.762 --> 08:53.731
This elevator
breaks down very much,
but nothing to worry about.

08:53.798 --> 08:57.868
Sometimes it starts by himself.
Sometimes somebody push
the button, and then it starts.

08:57.936 --> 08:59.870
Good.
Sometimes no.

08:59.938 --> 09:02.640
Oh, gee. Hey, look.
There's a trap door up there.

09:02.707 --> 09:05.643
Now, can't you go
through that trap door
and get help?
Yes, yes.

09:05.710 --> 09:08.513
But it's very dangerous.
It's better that you wait
a few minutes.

09:08.580 --> 09:12.983
I can't wait! I gotta
get up to an office upstairs.
Come on. Give us help quick.

09:13.051 --> 09:17.355
- Help! Quick! Help! Quick!
- Aw, geez. Jokes, jokes,
jokes, jokes.

09:17.422 --> 09:20.958
[ Continues in Spanish ]
What are you laughin' about?
It ain't funny.

09:21.026 --> 09:24.562
I don't think it's funny
either. I'm very upset.

09:24.630 --> 09:28.299
Look. I don't wanna
scare anyone, but I have
been known to be hysterical.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.801
I don't wanna hear.
Tell the colored guy, huh?

09:30.869 --> 09:34.472
You see,
when things go wrong, I just
fall apart. Little things.

09:34.540 --> 09:37.941
Like if a package doesn't arrive
on time from bloomingdale's,
I could just...

09:38.009 --> 09:39.943
Scratch somebody's
eyes out.

09:40.011 --> 09:44.582
Oh, really?
Once, I saw a snake. They had
to put me to bed for two days.

09:44.650 --> 09:48.018
Now this: Being stuck
in an elevator. Oh, hold me!

09:48.086 --> 09:51.989
What? What is this?
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, lady,
get off me!

09:52.057 --> 09:54.825
Listen. I'm a married guy.
You hold me!

09:54.893 --> 09:59.163
Get away! It's your fault. You
never should've been on this
elevator in the first place.

09:59.231 --> 10:02.032
- What am I talkin'?
I gotta get out of here.
- So do I.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.535
I have to deliver an address
at the larchmont rotary club
this evening.

10:04.603 --> 10:07.672
- Who cares?
- Larchmont cares.

10:07.739 --> 10:11.141
I'm the vice chairman
of the larchmont rotary.
I live in larchmont.

10:11.210 --> 10:14.812
Geez, I bet larchmont
is poppin' its buttons
over that.

Afraid to face the future?

10:30.061 --> 10:32.863
Listen. We are
wastin' time here.

Now, Pedro, you gotta
go through that trap door
and get help.

10:36.067 --> 10:38.168
Okay. If it's gonna
keep you quiet,
I go get help.

Hey, good boy, Pedro.
I'll give you a boost
up there.

the door to the next floor
and get some help.

No. Leave him alone.

get some help or something.

What's wrong?

the matter with her?
I hope
it isn't what I think it is.

what I think they're
talking about?

what they're talking about.

about having the baby here,

to forget it!

- Eight months.
- That's too early, Pedro.

- Well, maybe just a sip.
- <i>[ Mike ]</i>
<i> </i> <i>Sure. That's it.</i>

12:31.450 --> 12:34.352
[ Gloria ]
There you go.
That's the birthday girl.

12:34.419 --> 12:38.222
- Mmm. That's kind of tasty.
- Happy Birthday, ma.

12:38.289 --> 12:43.093
Happy Birthday, ma.
Oh, thank you, Gloria.
Thank you, Mike.

12:43.161 --> 12:47.064
I think
I'll have another sip.

12:50.435 --> 12:54.372
You know,
that ain't bad at all.

12:57.075 --> 12:59.577
Ma.

12:59.644 --> 13:04.382
My, I didn't realize
I was so thirsty.

13:04.449 --> 13:07.284
Here. Let me
pour you another glass.
Michael.

13:07.352 --> 13:09.587
Gloria, it's all right.
It's just once a year.

13:09.654 --> 13:14.992
Just to quench my thirst,
Gloria. These bread sticks
are awful dry.

13:15.059 --> 13:19.229
- Yeah. You're entitled, ma.
It's your birthday.
- Oh, thank you, Mike.

13:27.506 --> 13:31.809
Oh, my!
That's so good!

13:33.578 --> 13:35.679
<i>Well,</i>
<i>look at me, will ya?</i>

13:35.747 --> 13:40.350
Me, with claustrophobia,
acrophobia, 16 allergies
and a duodenal ulcer,

13:40.419 --> 13:43.020
and I'm still
hanging together.

13:43.087 --> 13:47.958
I can't believe it.
Don't believe it. You ain't
hangin' together that good.

13:48.026 --> 13:51.562
- <i>[ Serafina yelps ]</i>
<i>- Mr. Thompson, how long is it</i>
<i> since the last pain?</i>

13:51.630 --> 13:53.564
About six minutes.

13:53.632 --> 13:56.667
- Then they're coming faster.
- This is nuts!

13:56.735 --> 13:58.869
Don't get panicky, bunker.
These people have
had babies before.

13:58.937 --> 14:01.872
Well, why can't
they have 'em in a hospital?
That's where I had mine.

14:01.940 --> 14:05.709
I bet the hospital
is still buzzing over that.

14:08.513 --> 14:11.649
Mister, we already
have three babies born
in the hospital.

14:11.716 --> 14:14.985
You hear that? Three
ain't enough for him. He's gotta
have another one in a car...

14:15.053 --> 14:17.655
And now one in a building,
between floors.

14:17.722 --> 14:20.057
These people don't care where,
when or how many.

14:20.124 --> 14:23.694
They don't seem to be interested
in learning modern birth
control methods, do they?

14:23.762 --> 14:29.066
Oh, listen to this guy.
If that ain't the black
callin' the kettle "pot."

14:32.938 --> 14:37.875
Mr. Thompson,
that's not very nice.
No harm intended, mendoza,

14:37.943 --> 14:41.645
but it is a truism that
you people do have more children
than you can normally handle.

14:41.713 --> 14:44.682
My comment
was purely socioeconomic--
nothing personal.

14:44.749 --> 14:47.985
Well, let me 'plain
something to you, huh?

14:48.052 --> 14:52.456
One: How many children
we have is because
we love each other.

14:52.524 --> 14:56.193
Two: You talk
very intelligent, mister,
but you not so smart.

14:56.260 --> 14:59.463
Three: Shut up your face.

14:59.531 --> 15:02.099
Nothing personal.

15:05.036 --> 15:08.506
Thataboy, Pedro.
You tell him off.

15:08.573 --> 15:12.376
You got to admit that
larchmont here is partly right
about youse p.R.S.

15:12.443 --> 15:17.648
Mr. bunker, we do not like
to be called "p.R.S." We are
Americans equal to you.

15:17.716 --> 15:21.652
Equal to me? You ain't
even equal to him.

15:25.557 --> 15:30.594
-You ain't
natural born there, Pedro.
-Puerto ricans are natural born.

15:30.662 --> 15:35.733
<i>[ Archie ] Says who?</i>
<i>In 1917, the congress</i>
<i>of the United States says who.</i>

15:35.800 --> 15:40.938
We are very good citizens.
¶ [ Sings "star-spangled
banner" in Spanish ]

15:41.006 --> 15:46.911
Hold it. Hold it, Pedro. Now,
when you sing that song, you're
supposed to sing it in American.

15:46.978 --> 15:50.648
I mean, we have a little respect
here for our national anthem.

15:50.715 --> 15:54.418
Supposed to sing it
the way it's wrote, and only
on patriotic occasions...

15:54.485 --> 15:57.922
Like ball games and that.

15:57.989 --> 16:01.592
I wanna tell both of
youse minorities something, see?

16:01.660 --> 16:05.663
You're both
runnin' neck and neck
in the baby-makin' derby.

16:05.730 --> 16:08.966
And no matter
who wins the race, I lose.

16:09.034 --> 16:13.136
Just a minute, bunker.
What do you mean, you lose?

16:13.204 --> 16:17.007
I mean, I lose
my hard-earned dough
payin' out welfare taxes.

16:17.075 --> 16:21.211
I hand out more in tips
than you pay in taxes.

16:24.683 --> 16:27.585
I have lifted myself
from a slum tenement
in Newark, new Jersey...

16:27.652 --> 16:31.689
To a four-bedroom,
three-bathroom, split-level
contemporary ranch house...

16:31.756 --> 16:35.025
On a corner lot
with twin elms
in larchmont, New York.

16:35.093 --> 16:37.895
And having said that,
I should like
to end this conversation.

16:37.963 --> 16:42.833
- Well, whoopee-di-do.
- [ Serafina yelps ]

16:42.901 --> 16:44.969
How long is it this time?
It's almost two minutes
shorter.

16:45.036 --> 16:47.204
They're coming faster.
[ Hugh ]
Much faster.

16:47.271 --> 16:52.009
It's going to happen. She's
gonna have that baby right here,
right now, in this elevator.

16:52.077 --> 16:55.079
- Can't somebody do something?
- It's too late now!
Somebody should've...

16:55.146 --> 16:58.916
Talked to Pedro back when!

17:00.418 --> 17:02.820
That's a funny story,
ma.

17:02.887 --> 17:08.325
Oh. Oh, your father
was a scream when
we was goin' steady.

17:08.392 --> 17:11.028
Never a dull moment.

17:11.096 --> 17:15.165
You didn't know him then,
did you, Gloria?

17:15.233 --> 17:19.502
No, ma. I didn't meet him
till after you two
were married.

17:21.172 --> 17:26.175
Of course!
You wasn't born
till we met.

17:26.243 --> 17:30.247
Ooh! Oh,
till <i>after</i> we met.

17:30.314 --> 17:35.719
Long after! I mean,
he had to propose first.

17:35.787 --> 17:37.988
Oh, wait!

17:38.056 --> 17:40.157
Mmm.

17:40.224 --> 17:43.493
Wait till you hear
how he done that.

17:44.863 --> 17:47.798
It was so funny.

17:50.568 --> 17:52.736
It sounds funny.

18:01.179 --> 18:04.281
- Well, ma?
- "Well, ma" what?

18:04.348 --> 18:09.920
Daddy's proposal of marriage--
uh, Gloria, look. I'm gettin'
a little worried about Archie.

18:09.988 --> 18:13.957
- He's been gone
almost an hour.
- Who's gone?

18:15.093 --> 18:18.095
[ Mike ]
Archie.
Archie's gone?

18:18.163 --> 18:20.664
Oh, yeah!

18:23.367 --> 18:25.903
I think ma's
getting drunk.
Yeah.

18:25.970 --> 18:30.140
Uh, I'm going to go to that
Friedman building, see if I can
get Archie out of that office.

18:30.208 --> 18:35.545
- Ma, can you remember his name?
- Archie bunker.

18:37.381 --> 18:40.184
No, no, ma.
I meant the insurance man.

18:40.251 --> 18:44.387
Oh, it was a German name.
Kraut something.

18:44.455 --> 18:50.293
'Cause every time Archie
got a bill, he says, "that
kraut's puttin' the arm on me."

18:50.361 --> 18:53.931
"Hinkelmeier."
That's the one.
Good. Hinkelmeier.

18:53.998 --> 18:57.267
Hey, I-I'll be right back.
I'll try to find 'im.
Okay. Hurry, Michael.

18:57.335 --> 19:01.138
- Ma, are you sure
that's the name?
- Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

19:01.206 --> 19:04.507
That's the one.
"Hinkelmeier."

19:06.745 --> 19:09.113
Or "Swanson."

19:13.351 --> 19:17.354
[ Serafina gasping ]
Easy, Mrs. mendoza.
Easy, now.

19:17.421 --> 19:19.757
It will be very soon now.
Easy.

19:19.824 --> 19:22.592
- [ Carlos talks,
indistinct ]
- <i>[ Serafina yelps ]</i>

19:22.660 --> 19:26.930
Geez, I don't think
I can get through this.

19:26.998 --> 19:31.235
What are you so worried
about a baby being born? It's
a beautiful and natural thing.

19:31.302 --> 19:35.672
- What? In an elevator?
- Most men are squeamish
about it. It's a funny thing.

19:35.740 --> 19:39.442
You know, my own brother
took a whole course in natural
childbirth with his wife,

19:39.510 --> 19:42.512
then he started
watching the delivery
and fainted dead away.

19:42.580 --> 19:45.348
Oh. I ain't gonna faint.

19:45.416 --> 19:50.620
Listen. During the war--
and I mean the big one--
I handled emergencies every day.

19:50.688 --> 19:54.224
K.P. Or latrine duty?

19:58.696 --> 20:01.932
When I was
in the army air corps, them
were the only two places...

20:02.000 --> 20:04.968
We ever used
to see youse guys.

20:05.036 --> 20:08.806
As an officer
in the intelligence service, I
wouldn't have seen you at all.

20:13.511 --> 20:18.148

<i>I'm goin' for help.</i>
<i>Yeah. All right. Hey. Hear that?</i>

down there. He says hang on,
he's goin' for help. So hang on.

it's the baby. It's coming.
Oh, no, no. Listen.

We're gonna be downstairs
in a couple of minutes. Wait.
"Hold-o." "Stop-o."

Don't you worry, Mrs. mendoza.
We're all here, and we're
going to take care of you.

- We're all going to help,
right, bunker?
- Leave me out of this, huh?

20:56.087 --> 20:59.422
Hey, Mike,

[ Angelique ] Hold my hand here.

20:59.490 --> 21:01.591

gasping, speaking Spanish ]
Push. Oh, for heaven's sake!

absolutely remarkable!

21:36.261 --> 21:41.064
[ Angelique ] Mr. bunker, come
and look. You mustn't miss this.
I seen it in the movies.

21:41.132 --> 21:44.334
Bunker, you should
bear witness to this.
It's an absolute miracle.

21:44.402 --> 21:47.204
I know that, Thompson.
Just tell me when
it's over, huh?

21:47.272 --> 21:50.374
- You're
missing something unique.
- <i>[ Angelique ] It's fantastic!</i>

Now, watch the head.

Mr. bunker,
come see my son.

22:35.719 --> 22:39.689
You got a little boy, huh?

22:43.727 --> 22:46.729
Oh, it was unbelievable.
You should've been there.

22:46.797 --> 22:51.368
The elevator opens up, and
there's five people standing
there and a brand-new baby boy!

22:51.436 --> 22:55.238
It was born right there
in the elevator!
Born in the elevator? A baby?

22:55.306 --> 22:58.641
Yeah. It was incredible.
And the father, he was so happy,
he was jumpin' up and down,

22:58.709 --> 23:00.743
huggin' and kissin' everyone,
includin' Archie.

23:00.811 --> 23:02.912
Daddy, did you really
see the baby being born?

23:02.981 --> 23:06.783
How could you miss it
in an elevator?

23:06.851 --> 23:11.588
- And you helped?
- I was there.

23:11.655 --> 23:15.359
Daddy, don't be so modest!
You helped deliver a baby!
Wow!

23:15.426 --> 23:18.728
Well, I don't wanna
make myself out no kind
of surgeon or anything,

23:18.796 --> 23:22.599
but, uh, I know how
to handle myself in emergencies,
that's all.

I was the only one
that had <i>the daily news</i>
<i>when it was needed.</i>

Daddy, we're
all so proud of you.

23:36.514 --> 23:40.183
Well, I come out of it
pretty good, I think.

23:40.251 --> 23:43.286
But that baby
wasn't the only one
born today, you know.

23:43.354 --> 23:47.557
Someone else has got a birthday
around here. We're
celebratin' it now.

23:47.625 --> 23:50.727
And I wanna
propose a toast now.

23:50.794 --> 23:55.632
- I thought you didn't believe
in toasts, daddy.
- That was before.

- Edith--
- [ Uncontrollable giggling ]

24:07.611 --> 24:10.547

out of your mind.

Thank you.

Yeah. It ain't such
a bad restaurant after all.

my legs are full.

- Ma, Happy Birthday.
- [ Gloria ] Yeah.
Happy Birthday, ma.

24:40.744 --> 24:43.913
Look at Edith.
She's all excited.

24:47.118 --> 24:51.955
Well, just because this
is such a very special occasion,
I am gonna spring for the tab.

24:52.022 --> 24:56.159
-No, daddy. Let Michael do it.
-Wait. I said I was gonna treat.
-No, meathead. Let me do this.

24:56.227 --> 25:01.698
Now, let me do this.
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

insurance payment under the door
to the Friedman building.

- I gotta hustle over there.
- Forget that. What are
you doin'?

25:10.074 --> 25:15.445

right away. Watch your mother
before she hits the floor, huh?
