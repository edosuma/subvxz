15:58.999 --> 16:00.000
[phone dings]

16:08.051 --> 16:11.048
-She just texted me. What room are you in?
- 728.

16:11.079 --> 16:13.641
Okay. I'm gonna send
her there in an hour.

16:13.681 --> 16:14.797
All right, got it.

16:14.838 --> 16:17.688
Kaitlyn. I gotta get there.
I need a chopper.

16:18.779 --> 16:22.283
Hey, Mike, you got a bird
that can travel now?

16:24.850 --> 16:25.938
It's waiting for you.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.870
- Thank you. Bobby?
- Yeah.

16:27.911 --> 16:29.796
- Come on. Let's go.
- [Bobby] Shit.

16:31.857 --> 16:33.120
[car starts, tires squeal]

16:36.123 --> 16:40.083
[music]

16:50.746 --> 16:52.530
What are you doing?

16:54.040 --> 16:56.621
[sighs]

16:56.752 --> 16:58.232
I need to take a walk.

17:00.538 --> 17:02.323
I just...

17:02.453 --> 17:04.632
I need to process this.

17:09.373 --> 17:10.853
Are you coming back?

17:17.164 --> 17:18.339
I don't know.

17:18.948 --> 17:22.082
[music]

17:22.212 --> 17:24.040
This has no future.

17:24.171 --> 17:25.954
It has the future we make it.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.790
Then it has no future.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.425
Everything alright?

17:33.475 --> 17:34.703
Yeah.

17:35.812 --> 17:37.706
I'm just getting
some fresh air.

17:42.014 --> 17:43.364
[knocking]

17:45.844 --> 17:47.368
[speaking Arabic]

17:48.192 --> 17:49.283
Everything's fine.

17:49.413 --> 17:50.498
Doesn't look fine.

17:50.549 --> 17:52.634
We had a fight.
Friends fight.

17:52.764 --> 17:54.026
Want me to go after her?

17:54.067 --> 17:55.115
No.

17:55.245 --> 17:57.160
No, let her go.

17:59.728 --> 18:00.903
[bell dings]

18:16.919 --> 18:19.051
Joe here?

18:19.182 --> 18:20.792
Just landed.
She's coming up.

18:23.491 --> 18:25.057
Want a water or something?

18:27.071 --> 18:28.322
Yeah.

18:33.805 --> 18:35.155
[knocking]

18:39.681 --> 18:41.204
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:47.471 --> 18:49.269
I'm gonna go grab
a drink at the bar.

18:49.299 --> 18:51.040
-If you need me, text me.
-[Joe] Yeah.

18:53.912 --> 18:55.697
[door opens, closes]

18:55.827 --> 18:57.568
What happened?

18:57.699 --> 18:59.614
We had sex is what happened.

18:59.744 --> 19:01.574
So, you had sex.

19:03.074 --> 19:04.467
What's the issue?

19:06.186 --> 19:08.441
The issue is I'm not...
trained for this.

19:08.492 --> 19:12.322
I don't know how to pretend
to be one thing and just...

19:12.453 --> 19:14.324
not feel.

19:14.455 --> 19:18.671
I... I think I'm in
fucking love with her

19:18.691 --> 19:20.266
and now I'm going to fly
across the world to--

19:20.287 --> 19:21.411
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

19:21.451 --> 19:23.085
I don't care how big
this room is,

19:23.115 --> 19:25.054
you talk this shit in a whisper.

19:26.075 --> 19:27.903
[whispering]
I can't do this.

19:28.033 --> 19:30.427
I can't do this.
I--

19:30.558 --> 19:32.715
Okay. You know what,
just sit down. Just...

19:41.111 --> 19:42.396
Look at me.

19:43.962 --> 19:45.268
I know how it feels:

19:45.399 --> 19:49.403
always on guard,
no one you can confide in,

19:49.533 --> 19:52.449
there is alone
and then there's you.

19:53.798 --> 19:55.060
I get it.

19:58.760 --> 20:02.111
And I also know that you...

20:02.242 --> 20:03.953
have been abused

20:05.333 --> 20:06.937
and ignored.

20:07.508 --> 20:11.381
You have no family,
you have no friends.

20:13.340 --> 20:16.256
And then you gave yourself
to the Marines,

20:16.866 --> 20:18.483
and then to me.

20:19.253 --> 20:24.351
And now you have a purpose,
and it is noble.

20:27.963 --> 20:30.095
But it can't make
you feel loved.

20:30.906 --> 20:34.012
It can't make
you feel wanted.

20:35.483 --> 20:36.903
And people need that.

20:37.364 --> 20:41.193
She made you feel that
and I'm...

20:41.324 --> 20:43.005
I'm glad.

20:43.736 --> 20:47.819
But don't delude yourself into
thinking she's in love with you.

20:48.810 --> 20:52.727
You are her last hoorah
before she assumes the role

20:52.857 --> 20:56.905
of baby maker
and baby raiser.

20:57.035 --> 21:00.648
This whole thing flying
from beach to beach,

21:00.778 --> 21:03.390
that shit is done.

21:03.520 --> 21:08.177
She is going to a compound in
Riyadh where she will stay,

21:08.308 --> 21:12.834
covered in a burqa to get
pregnant and raise children.

21:14.559 --> 21:16.620
You've been to war.

21:16.751 --> 21:19.884
You have killed
many a father,

21:20.555 --> 21:22.234
and you will do it again.

21:23.410 --> 21:26.717
What's different
about this one is...

21:26.848 --> 21:31.548
he is financially responsible
for every conflict

21:31.679 --> 21:33.947
in the Middle East since 9-11.

21:35.987 --> 21:38.373
Neutralizing this man
is the equivalent

21:38.414 --> 21:42.994
of blowing up the only bank
accessible to terrorists.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.954
They lose their ability
to borrow money,

21:46.084 --> 21:48.043
move it and launder it.

21:48.173 --> 21:52.221
This is the biggest target we
have uncovered since Bin Laden,

21:52.352 --> 21:54.441
who was a father,
I might add.

21:56.573 --> 21:59.576
Is there anything you
wouldn't say or do

21:59.707 --> 22:04.102
to a child of Bin Laden's
to rid the world of him?

22:06.235 --> 22:07.279
No.

22:11.936 --> 22:13.460
[music]

22:15.322 --> 22:16.830
She is using you

22:19.060 --> 22:21.229
the same way we're using her.

22:21.859 --> 22:25.385
All you are to her is a
last attempt at feeling free.

22:25.515 --> 22:28.182
And if you want her to feel
that, that's your choice.

22:28.232 --> 22:29.691
You can do that.

22:30.281 --> 22:34.297
And yes, you making contact
and eliminating that target,

22:35.168 --> 22:37.920
that betrayal will break her.

22:39.050 --> 22:42.117
But I got news for you:
it was gonna break her anyway.

22:42.168 --> 22:45.622
[sighs]
This is too fucking hard.

22:45.753 --> 22:48.190
Give the other guy a gun,
I'll be the first one

22:48.220 --> 22:49.713
through the door to fight him.

22:49.844 --> 22:51.280
Just give me a fair fight.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.325
There's no such thing
as a fair fight.

22:56.938 --> 22:59.509
This will all
be over in a week.

23:00.420 --> 23:04.424
I just need you to pretend
for seven days.

23:04.554 --> 23:06.774
Give me seven days.

23:06.904 --> 23:08.602
That's it.

23:08.732 --> 23:10.299
And then you're out.

23:14.303 --> 23:16.131
Can you do that for me?

23:20.222 --> 23:21.310
I can try.

23:25.575 --> 23:27.795
But I don't think
she's pretending.

23:27.925 --> 23:30.537
I don't care if she is.

23:30.667 --> 23:32.539
I only care that
you're pretending.

23:34.541 --> 23:37.935
[music]

23:44.464 --> 23:46.466
[door opens]

23:51.471 --> 23:52.776
What did I do wrong?

23:52.907 --> 23:54.796
You didn't do anything wrong.

23:54.897 --> 23:56.301
[door closes]

23:57.215 --> 23:58.734
Bring up the audio.

23:59.435 --> 24:02.090
But you're acting like
I did something wrong.

24:03.483 --> 24:05.273
I only did what you wanted.

24:05.304 --> 24:06.355
You're getting married.

24:06.376 --> 24:07.965
I'm getting traded.

24:09.619 --> 24:13.057
[music]

24:20.891 --> 24:22.850
[beeps]

24:22.980 --> 24:24.173
What happened?

24:24.214 --> 24:27.071
I don't know.
[typing]

24:27.202 --> 24:28.638
I can't go with
you to Mallorca.

24:30.420 --> 24:32.338
I don't want to watch
your father give you away,

24:32.369 --> 24:33.861
and you don't want
me anywhere near it.

24:33.991 --> 24:35.516
Trust me.

24:36.777 --> 24:38.822
- You're on our signal, right?
- Of course I'm on the signal.

24:38.953 --> 24:40.747
- What happened, Kyle?
- It's not transmitting.

24:40.788 --> 24:43.563
Son of a bitch, she fucking
turned the transmitter,

24:43.614 --> 24:44.654
she turned it off.

24:44.705 --> 24:45.829
Where's your kit?

24:45.960 --> 24:47.555
It's right here.

24:47.625 --> 24:49.354
She's outing herself,

24:49.485 --> 24:52.880
she's blowing
the whole fucking mission.

24:53.010 --> 24:55.447
You won't get to watch
that no matter what.

24:55.578 --> 24:57.275
My father can't be in public.

24:57.886 --> 24:59.321
I only see him in Riyadh.

24:59.451 --> 25:01.236
He won't be at the wedding?

25:01.277 --> 25:03.630
That would be suicide for him.
He is smarter than that.

25:10.027 --> 25:11.502
We can't do this anymore.

25:11.663 --> 25:13.248
- It's too complicated.
- Wait.

25:13.378 --> 25:15.511
It's pointless.

25:15.642 --> 25:18.035
Or cancel the wedding
and we see what happens.

25:20.385 --> 25:24.520
If I canceled the wedding,
I'd be killed.

25:28.872 --> 25:32.833
I think it's worse
to feel love just once.

25:34.428 --> 25:36.010
Better never to feel it.

25:38.578 --> 25:40.797
Now I know what I'm missing.

25:46.542 --> 25:49.123
I leave for Riyadh
first thing in the morning.

25:49.363 --> 25:51.712
There will be five hundred
people at the wedding.

25:52.722 --> 25:54.117
And no friends.

25:55.638 --> 25:57.083
Unless you come.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.426
I have a room for you at
the house, if you'll accept it.

26:08.346 --> 26:10.218
Yeah. I'll accept it.

26:13.134 --> 26:15.223
[music]

26:31.718 --> 26:34.285
I'm almost on
the street heading south.

26:34.416 --> 26:37.130
TSS Heliport.
34th and FDR.

26:37.191 --> 26:39.160
Take a cab, don't take
an Uber. Pay cash.

26:50.214 --> 26:52.347
[music]

26:52.477 --> 26:54.436
[engine whining]

27:32.517 --> 27:33.518
Come with me.

27:42.702 --> 27:43.833
[Joe] Sit.

27:43.874 --> 27:44.881
I'll stand.

27:44.921 --> 27:47.054
Sit the fuck down.

27:49.970 --> 27:51.145
Are you blown?

27:53.887 --> 27:55.030
Answer me.

27:56.411 --> 27:58.195
I'm not blown.

27:58.326 --> 28:00.458
You shut off your transmitter.

28:02.722 --> 28:03.810
I thought about it.

28:03.940 --> 28:05.184
Then I turned it back on.

28:05.205 --> 28:06.334
What did you tell her?

28:06.464 --> 28:07.465
That it's pointless.

28:08.566 --> 28:09.681
That it's just...

28:10.381 --> 28:11.600
We have no future.

28:11.731 --> 28:13.254
What else?

28:13.384 --> 28:14.646
That's it.

28:14.777 --> 28:16.474
What else?

28:17.649 --> 28:18.950
Nothing.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.004
Eight people are going to risk
their lives to protect you. What else?

28:24.054 --> 28:25.337
Nothing else.

28:25.388 --> 28:26.788
She said her father
won't be at the wedding.

28:26.848 --> 28:29.052
That's what
she's trained to say.

28:29.183 --> 28:31.123
Why didn't you stay with her?

28:32.403 --> 28:33.665
Because--

28:33.796 --> 28:35.255
- Why?
- Because...

28:35.316 --> 28:36.973
Because, because, because.
Why?

28:37.104 --> 28:39.715
Because I can't sleep
beside the woman

28:39.846 --> 28:41.747
whose father
I'm supposed to kill!

28:42.718 --> 28:44.278
I can't!

28:44.738 --> 28:46.933
I fucked up.
I'm not trained for this.

28:46.983 --> 28:48.463
I don't know how to do this.

28:49.594 --> 28:53.033
[music]

28:55.644 --> 28:57.037
She gave you this?

29:00.174 --> 29:01.911
Why not fly with her?

29:02.042 --> 29:03.608
She's going to Riyadh first.

29:03.739 --> 29:06.698
You trust her on a
commercial flight alone?

29:06.829 --> 29:09.353
How can I trust this now?

29:09.484 --> 29:12.356
Going under is stressful.

29:12.487 --> 29:14.912
The lines of what
is real always get blurred.

29:15.213 --> 29:17.170
With someone that
has no training.

29:21.694 --> 29:23.176
Maybe she doesn't show.

29:24.891 --> 29:26.370
We punt this one.

29:27.641 --> 29:30.134
We lose the op,
we save the program.

29:31.114 --> 29:35.075
I just need to sleep and think and try to
get my fucking head right.

29:35.205 --> 29:38.078
We need our Marine back.

29:38.208 --> 29:40.384
You need to remember
what you're fighting for.

29:40.515 --> 29:42.169
[crying]
I know.

29:43.219 --> 29:45.389
I say she misses her flight.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.174
Takes a ride
with us to Barcelona.

29:47.304 --> 29:49.611
Travels on from there.
Kyle can shadow.

29:49.741 --> 29:51.091
[crying]

29:53.093 --> 29:57.358
Have you ever been in a battle
you didn't think you'd survive?

29:59.237 --> 30:01.797
And fear wanted
to curl you in a ball

30:01.928 --> 30:05.888
and try to wish the fight away?
You ever felt that?

30:06.019 --> 30:09.587
But you kept your finger
on that trigger

30:09.718 --> 30:14.157
and your focus down range and
you fucking fought through it.

30:14.288 --> 30:15.942
This is no different.

30:16.072 --> 30:18.596
It's the same thing.

30:18.727 --> 30:24.385
The difference here: in battle,
the guilt comes after.

30:24.515 --> 30:29.216
In this fight, the guilt is with
you from the very beginning.

30:32.132 --> 30:34.482
Grab a bunk.
Get some sleep.

30:34.612 --> 30:36.310
Take a shower.

30:36.440 --> 30:39.139
We're wheels up at 1500.

30:48.931 --> 30:51.107
[door opens, closes]

30:51.794 --> 30:54.241
I'm not sure
she can be glued back together.

30:54.371 --> 30:55.851
I've just reached
the Marine in her.

30:55.882 --> 30:57.331
She's a fighter.
She can do it.

30:57.461 --> 30:59.811
All the same, a missile
strike is our surest option.

30:59.942 --> 31:01.552
If it comes to that.

31:04.412 --> 31:05.817
I know.

31:05.948 --> 31:08.081
You know or you agree?

31:11.084 --> 31:14.478
I disagree with
every fiber of my being.

31:14.609 --> 31:16.176
But I'll do it.

31:18.830 --> 31:20.615
You gonna go home first?

31:20.745 --> 31:24.184
Yeah. Kate gets home today.
I wanna see her.

31:25.098 --> 31:26.838
I would too.

31:26.969 --> 31:28.492
Yeah.

31:29.403 --> 31:30.657
Wheels up at three?

31:30.688 --> 31:32.148
Mm-hmm.

31:36.152 --> 31:38.328
[music playing over headphones]

31:38.459 --> 31:41.679
[snoring]

31:41.810 --> 31:43.027
You doing okay, kiddo?

31:43.638 --> 31:44.856
Been better.

31:44.987 --> 31:47.337
You know, you have the hardest
job on this unit.

31:48.730 --> 31:50.700
And there ain't a close second.

31:51.511 --> 31:52.952
I couldn't do your job.

31:53.082 --> 31:55.128
Not even for five minutes.

31:55.258 --> 31:56.800
I've made a
pretty big mess of it.

31:57.391 --> 31:59.654
Hey, you ain't messed nothing.

32:01.786 --> 32:03.858
You've got us
on the ace of spades.

32:05.268 --> 32:08.024
It's not about how you do it.
You did it.

32:09.055 --> 32:12.406
Just keep that compass
pointed north, huh?

32:14.147 --> 32:15.746
I'm trying.

32:17.237 --> 32:18.797
Where are the bunks?

32:19.698 --> 32:20.981
Down the hallway.

32:21.141 --> 32:22.851
Take any one on the right.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.789
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

32:26.333 --> 32:27.540
And thank you.

32:47.484 --> 32:48.877
All right, kiddo.
Let's go.

32:49.008 --> 32:50.444
New car?

32:50.574 --> 32:52.272
Yeah, the wheelchair
wouldn't fit in mine.

32:52.402 --> 32:54.187
Plus, I wanna strap it
to the roof, so...

32:55.927 --> 32:58.278
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, Mom.

33:00.823 --> 33:02.891
Okay, you ready for this?

33:03.022 --> 33:05.067
Can't be much worse
than getting in the car.

33:05.198 --> 33:06.242
Okay, ready?

33:06.373 --> 33:07.896
[grunts]

33:08.027 --> 33:10.768
- [Joe] Slow and steady.
- [Neal] There you go.

33:10.899 --> 33:12.161
- Okay.
- Okay?

33:12.666 --> 33:13.784
Yeah.

33:13.865 --> 33:16.009
Let the rehab begin, huh?

33:16.339 --> 33:17.993
[Joe] Damn right.

33:20.430 --> 33:22.998
[Neal] Okay, welcome home.
[door closes]

33:27.133 --> 33:30.745
When Dad said you broke it

33:30.875 --> 33:33.268
he meant you broke
broke it?

33:33.348 --> 33:36.229
Mm-hmm. Doesn't really
get more broke.

33:37.244 --> 33:38.353
Can you walk?

33:38.504 --> 33:39.946
Does it look like I can walk?

33:39.986 --> 33:41.665
Remember her age.

33:42.145 --> 33:44.733
Should be in a month
I can walk.

33:45.604 --> 33:48.629
And then in a week
I can use crutches.

33:49.459 --> 33:50.808
[Joe] I'm gonna get this
out of the way.

33:50.939 --> 33:52.332
[Neal] All right.
Pull it back.

33:52.462 --> 33:53.724
Get this pillow.

33:53.855 --> 33:55.509
How does that feel?

33:55.639 --> 33:56.874
It's fine.

33:56.915 --> 33:59.560
Looks like you get shower
and bathroom detail, Mom.

34:00.381 --> 34:01.674
Lucky you.

34:02.994 --> 34:04.300
Can you give us a minute?

34:05.067 --> 34:08.348
Yeah.
Thanks, Charlie.

34:13.179 --> 34:15.050
I have a favor to ask you.

34:15.181 --> 34:16.572
- Okay.
- It's a big one.

34:16.704 --> 34:17.966
Okay.

34:18.097 --> 34:20.184
I need you to forgive me.

34:20.244 --> 34:21.253
For what?

34:22.704 --> 34:24.364
For not being
here this week.

34:24.893 --> 34:26.308
Where are you going?

34:28.005 --> 34:30.413
Somewhere I'd rather
not go to do something

34:30.454 --> 34:32.850
I just, um...
I don't want to do, Kate.

34:32.981 --> 34:34.014
Then why do it?

34:34.063 --> 34:37.762
Because I believe that
doing it will save lives.

34:38.292 --> 34:43.699
Look, mom. I know that
he's a doctor and all,

34:43.719 --> 34:48.563
but I can't have my father
help me use the bathroom

34:48.594 --> 34:50.824
and bathe me,
it's a mother's job.

34:50.955 --> 34:54.069
Which is why we have a nurse
coming to stay here with us.

34:54.559 --> 34:56.563
And she's gonna be staying
in the guest room.

34:57.405 --> 34:59.094
Okay. Problem solved then.

35:10.323 --> 35:11.846
Is it dangerous?

35:12.673 --> 35:15.589
[music]

35:15.719 --> 35:16.807
Where you're going?

35:17.747 --> 35:19.013
Yes.

35:20.594 --> 35:21.943
Could you be killed?

35:23.771 --> 35:24.859
Yes.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.124
Are you going there
to kill someone else?

35:29.255 --> 35:30.785
I can't answer that, Kate.

35:31.735 --> 35:33.868
- You just did.

35:33.998 --> 35:38.327
Hey, I need you
to give me your word

35:38.387 --> 35:40.570
that this stays
between us, okay?

35:40.701 --> 35:41.793
And only us.

35:41.894 --> 35:43.872
You can't even
tell your father about this.

35:44.922 --> 35:45.923
Promise me.

35:47.925 --> 35:48.926
I promise.

35:51.666 --> 35:52.887
Are you scared?

35:55.716 --> 35:56.923
Very scared.

35:58.284 --> 36:02.505
Can you... Can you promise me
you'll come back?

36:02.636 --> 36:08.032
It's... It's bad luck
to make that promise.

36:08.163 --> 36:09.817
I promise you I'll try.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.128
[kissing]

36:19.392 --> 36:20.523
Mom?

36:20.654 --> 36:21.698
Yeah?

36:21.829 --> 36:22.960
I love you.

36:26.442 --> 36:27.835
I love you, too.

36:34.537 --> 36:35.691
[crying]

36:36.931 --> 36:38.917
Why's mama crying?

36:39.028 --> 36:40.992
She's just worried about Kate.

36:41.033 --> 36:42.980
Why don't you go and
check on your sister?

36:49.030 --> 36:50.336
Why are you crying?

36:50.466 --> 36:51.772
[sobbing]

37:06.439 --> 37:08.348
I guess she didn't take
it too well, huh?

37:08.438 --> 37:11.792
She took it a hell
of a lot better than I did.

37:11.922 --> 37:14.098
This is the last one.
I'm putting in for a desk.

37:14.229 --> 37:16.341
I can't fucking
do this anymore.

37:16.871 --> 37:18.501
Make that decision
on a Saturday

37:18.552 --> 37:20.191
when our kid's not in traction

37:20.232 --> 37:22.513
and there's no
plane waiting, okay?

37:22.563 --> 37:24.056
No.

37:25.719 --> 37:27.373
The decision's been made.

37:34.858 --> 37:36.120
I love you.

37:37.905 --> 37:39.167
I love you.

37:53.442 --> 37:55.531
This is a bad one, isn't it?

37:58.360 --> 37:59.883
Yeah.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.151
I'm off to see the world.

38:14.144 --> 38:15.421
Hey.

38:17.553 --> 38:18.951
What's the matter?

38:19.132 --> 38:22.753
Everybody's crying
and I don't know why.

38:22.823 --> 38:24.111
No, baby, no.

38:24.161 --> 38:28.928
We're just... we're happy
that your sister's home.

38:29.238 --> 38:31.611
- That's it?
- That's it.

38:31.741 --> 38:33.787
Oh.

38:33.917 --> 38:35.310
It's okay.

38:39.575 --> 38:41.403
We're all a bunch
of softies, huh?

38:52.893 --> 38:54.590
[music]

39:05.384 --> 39:07.261
[Errol] Olaf made a deal
with the devil,

39:07.312 --> 39:08.822
now he's paying for it.

39:11.545 --> 39:13.610
Being dependent on
a resource you can't harvest

39:13.650 --> 39:15.306
means your political
position is the position

39:15.366 --> 39:17.894
of the nation you buy
the resource from.

39:18.394 --> 39:19.572
Uh, let me call you back.

39:21.487 --> 39:23.445
- Thought you left.
- Got delayed.

39:23.576 --> 39:24.953
I'm leaving now.

39:27.014 --> 39:28.755
Drove all the way back
to tell me you're leaving?

39:28.885 --> 39:30.757
I thought you deserved
a proper goodbye.

39:33.063 --> 39:35.544
You're on a clock, so I won't
make you work for it.

39:36.980 --> 39:40.027
This is a tricky one, Kate.

39:40.157 --> 39:43.517
We have so thoroughly fucked up the
political structure of the Gulf states,

39:43.587 --> 39:45.636
the leaders we have
placed in power

39:46.816 --> 39:49.970
need us to be the enemy
of their people.

39:50.820 --> 39:52.602
Or the people will
start asking

39:52.642 --> 39:56.068
why point six percent
of the population

39:56.258 --> 39:58.690
has income over
1 million dollars

39:58.741 --> 40:02.876
and 41 percent make less
than ten thousand dollars.

40:04.015 --> 40:07.010
Unrest in the region
protects those in power.

40:07.141 --> 40:09.404
And we need them
to stay in power.

40:09.535 --> 40:11.932
Iran is what happens
when they don't.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.743
So, we take our licks.

40:14.714 --> 40:15.983
When they push it too far,

40:16.043 --> 40:19.632
say they start flying
planes into buildings,

40:19.992 --> 40:21.425
they take a beating.

40:23.287 --> 40:24.724
You're on the verge
of removing

40:24.854 --> 40:29.038
the financial center
of that unrest.

40:29.139 --> 40:34.211
And as tragic and awful
as their attacks may be,

40:34.342 --> 40:37.258
they worry
the unknown is worse.

40:37.388 --> 40:38.565
What do you think?

40:39.086 --> 40:42.132
All this nonsense
about climate change.

40:42.263 --> 40:45.353
We sit on the precipice of
a third world war every day.

40:45.484 --> 40:47.703
And none of the global powers--
ours included--

40:47.834 --> 40:49.705
has the leadership
to navigate us

40:49.736 --> 40:51.216
through that without
nuclear war.

40:52.316 --> 40:55.015
The sooner we get our energy
from anything besides oil,

40:55.145 --> 40:57.757
the better chance we have of
not exterminating ourselves.

40:57.887 --> 41:00.153
I doubt the species lives
long enough

41:00.194 --> 41:02.762
to die from climate change.

41:04.209 --> 41:05.329
That's what I think.

41:05.913 --> 41:07.211
Hm.

41:08.202 --> 41:11.074
Thank you for removing my
moral high ground on this one.

41:13.033 --> 41:15.091
- Kate...
- [chuckles]

41:15.731 --> 41:17.254
You've been
doing this long enough

41:17.295 --> 41:18.969
to know that morality
doesn't factor in at all.

41:19.909 --> 41:21.623
At the end of the day,
your job is to make sure

41:21.694 --> 41:23.391
our text books
aren't in Russian.

41:23.522 --> 41:27.484
Survival is a better motivator
than morality anyway.

41:28.999 --> 41:30.271
Be careful, Kate.

41:30.372 --> 41:32.261
Everyone's watching
on this one.

41:32.361 --> 41:34.097
Careful is why they send me.

41:36.546 --> 41:38.188
I'll see you in a week.

41:38.319 --> 41:40.277
If I don't end up
in a Spanish prison.

41:40.408 --> 41:42.758
Are you making a joke or
is that where you're going?

41:42.889 --> 41:44.630
See ya in a week.

41:45.805 --> 41:47.807
[music]

42:04.040 --> 42:06.608
[knocking]
[Two Cups] We're wheels up.

42:48.519 --> 42:49.956
Oh, fuck.

42:50.086 --> 42:51.914
Now it's a party!

42:54.395 --> 42:56.702
I need every shooter
I can get for this one.

42:56.832 --> 42:58.094
Yeah.

43:24.207 --> 43:25.339
How you doing?

43:26.557 --> 43:27.646
I'm here.

43:30.891 --> 43:32.868
I want you to watch something.

43:36.219 --> 43:38.482
This is news footage,
surveillance footage

43:38.613 --> 43:43.072
and satellite imagery of
every single terrorist attack

43:43.122 --> 43:47.061
we can conclusively
link Amrohi to.

43:47.161 --> 43:50.886
It's an eight hour flight.
You're not gonna finish it.

43:51.017 --> 43:52.845
But I want you to try.

43:52.975 --> 43:54.498
I want you to remember

43:54.629 --> 43:56.849
the Marine who volunteered
to do this.

43:56.979 --> 43:58.459
Because we need her.

44:04.465 --> 44:08.687
[music]

44:21.743 --> 44:23.223
So, we think
it's this house.

44:23.353 --> 44:24.729
It was rented last week.

44:24.790 --> 44:26.922
We do have a satellite
on it now.

44:27.053 --> 44:29.267
My eyes on the ground
count a security team

44:29.318 --> 44:31.753
of eight doing the advance.

44:31.884 --> 44:34.060
If you look right here, there's
all kinds of shit going on.

44:34.080 --> 44:35.805
Caterers, florists.

44:35.855 --> 44:38.013
Looks like they're building some
sort of a stage for a band.

44:38.064 --> 44:39.552
Where is our recon staged?

44:39.613 --> 44:41.458
In a house about
a half mile away.

44:41.589 --> 44:43.199
But I do want to get 'em out
of there as soon as possible,

44:43.330 --> 44:46.072
I'm sure his team's already
marked as a sniper's nest.

44:46.202 --> 44:48.184
If we need to intercept,
where's our best approach?

44:48.204 --> 44:49.553
Approach is a disaster.

44:49.594 --> 44:50.832
It sits on a peninsula.

44:50.903 --> 44:52.636
The shoreline
is a fucking cliff.

44:52.687 --> 44:55.007
There's a stairwell
that leads up from the beach.

44:55.037 --> 44:57.576
We haven't cracked that yet,
but we're working on it.

44:57.666 --> 45:00.712
Infil and exfil will
most likely be from the water.

45:00.783 --> 45:03.089
So base off a yacht, something
else that's fast to insert.

45:03.219 --> 45:04.830
The Roosevelt does
have a crack team

45:04.861 --> 45:06.875
of PJs assigned to it.

45:07.006 --> 45:10.826
They could insert and yank us
from the water on the exfil.

45:10.857 --> 45:12.620
It's either that
or a fucking chopper,

45:12.751 --> 45:14.867
but... nothing
low-viz about a chopper.

45:14.908 --> 45:16.711
If you are being exfilled

45:16.842 --> 45:18.887
then the low-viz option
has been blown.

45:21.324 --> 45:23.370
[music]

45:32.771 --> 45:36.252
[Two Cups] So what's the food
situation on this fucking thing?

45:36.383 --> 45:37.645
Is this it?

45:37.776 --> 45:39.821
Chips and fucking
mixed nuts.

45:39.952 --> 45:41.465
Look in the back.

45:41.556 --> 45:43.387
That way.
