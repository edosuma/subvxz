00:00.999 --> 00:03.533
Eve, hurry up, you're gonna
be late for your first day

00:03.534 --> 00:06.068
of work, and I hear your
new boss is a real hardass.

00:06.103 --> 00:09.201
- Her new boss is me.
- I got it.

00:09.236 --> 00:11.803
Mike got Eve an internship
down at the station.

00:11.838 --> 00:13.818
She's at that age
where she doesn't wanna

00:13.818 --> 00:17.671
- hang with us anymore.
- So I did what any good dad would do.

00:17.706 --> 00:20.039
I forced her to be an unpaid laborer.

00:20.274 --> 00:23.173
Now there's my little helper.
Quick pop quiz.

00:23.208 --> 00:25.373
Do I or do I not like guacamole
on my burrito?

00:25.408 --> 00:27.207
Stop calling me your little helper.

00:27.242 --> 00:29.041
And that's a trick question.
You don't like burritos.

00:29.076 --> 00:31.109
<i>Bueno.
 Muy Bueno.</i>

00:31.144 --> 00:32.743
- Quick, Annie, snap a picture.
- Already on it.

00:32.778 --> 00:34.878
One serious.
[camera shutter clicks]

00:34.913 --> 00:36.234
One silly.
[camera shutter clicks]

00:36.235 --> 00:38.902
Let's go one thing straight.
If I'm gonna do this internship,

00:38.936 --> 00:40.670
can you at least not
treat me like a child?

00:40.704 --> 00:42.422
I guess you won't be
wanting one of these then.

00:42.456 --> 00:43.484
[sighs]

00:43.528 --> 00:46.309
- Oh! Are we giving out lollipops?
- Just for interns.

00:46.343 --> 00:49.162
[scoffs] Internships.
They're just a way of tricking

00:49.163 --> 00:51.981
a bunch of naive kids into
doing all the work for free,

00:52.016 --> 00:55.752
while one guy at the top
sits back and gets rich off of...

00:55.786 --> 00:57.487
maybe I should get an intern.

00:57.521 --> 00:59.439
Shouldn't you have work
before expanding your workforce?

00:59.473 --> 01:01.624
Don't chicken or egg me, Dad.
I'm a busy man.

01:01.659 --> 01:03.752
<i>But if I had an intern
to help organize these</i>

01:03.753 --> 01:05.845
presentation binders together,
I could stay big picture.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.747
Work smart, not hard.

01:07.781 --> 01:10.383
Because if...
I have jelly on my shirt.

01:10.401 --> 01:11.784
And it's on my pants.
What the...

01:11.819 --> 01:14.637
Oh! And it's in my hair.

01:14.672 --> 01:18.474
- Yeah.
- Who gave him jelly?

01:18.878 --> 01:21.028

Dad, enough with the lollipops.

01:43.454 --> 01:45.572
Whoa, we're throwing
lollipops around, huh?

01:45.606 --> 01:48.958
Oh, orange.
Hey, Evie. Mwah.

01:48.993 --> 01:51.594
- Hey, Harris.
- Welcome aboard.

01:51.628 --> 01:52.562
Now listen, if you're unsure what to do,

01:52.596 --> 01:54.964
Doug over there
has been an intern for nine years,

01:54.999 --> 01:58.152
so just watch what he does
and do the opposite.

01:59.186 --> 02:02.972
Not again. Somebody cut
Doug out of the copier!

02:03.007 --> 02:05.641
Anything you need,
my door is wide open.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.744
And if it isn't, do not come in,
no matter what you hear.

02:08.763 --> 02:10.013
<i>Be careful with it, okay?</i>

02:10.047 --> 02:12.732
It's going into my office.
It's a jason ambrose.

02:12.767 --> 02:14.033
Is that the name of the
guy whose skin you used

02:14.084 --> 02:15.952
- to upholster it?
- Oh, clever.

02:15.986 --> 02:19.189
Oh, this is my daughter, Eve.
Eve, this is Susan, my associate.

02:19.223 --> 02:22.175
- Associate?
- Is Diane Sawyer John Turner's associate?

02:22.209 --> 02:24.227
- Who's John Turner?
- Exactly.

02:24.261 --> 02:25.829
So this is what you guys do all day.

02:25.863 --> 02:28.348
Oh, look, she's funny,
and she's pretty too.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.016
Where did she get it?
Is your mailman handsome?

02:30.050 --> 02:32.535
If she gives you any trouble,
just throw water on her.

02:32.553 --> 02:33.686
She'll melt.
[laughs]

02:33.721 --> 02:35.772
Oh, do you really wanna
go down a yellow brick road

02:35.806 --> 02:36.840
that leads to munchkins, Mike?

02:36.874 --> 02:38.208
- Susan.
- Yeah?

02:38.242 --> 02:40.927
Is it possible we could call a truce
at least while my daughter's in?

02:40.961 --> 02:43.486
Oh, sure.
I totally get it, Mike,

02:43.521 --> 02:46.466
you need a couple of weeks to
think of a comeback. [laughs]

02:46.500 --> 02:48.219
Truce begins now.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.838
Say hello to the flying monkeys.

02:51.872 --> 02:55.308
- Yes!
- Nice one, dad.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.894
Hey, Annie!
Ooh.

02:57.912 --> 02:59.362
That's what you're wearing to work?

02:59.380 --> 03:02.448
- I was gonna cover my lower half.
- Good call.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.083
<i>Hey, listen, thanks so much</i>

03:04.118 --> 03:05.952
for letting me come to
your class the other day.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.371
It's so amazing you
bring in real live authors

03:08.405 --> 03:11.391
- to read to your students.
- Oh, well, you know, I like to provide

03:11.425 --> 03:14.443
positive role models for the kids.
Plus I get an hour off.

03:14.461 --> 03:18.815
- I am up to "guava level" on fruit ninja.
- In fact, I was so inspired

03:18.849 --> 03:21.784
that I finished writing the
first chapter of my book,

03:21.818 --> 03:23.553
and I want you to be
the first to read it.

03:23.587 --> 03:25.538
Oh...

03:25.573 --> 03:28.324
It's your classic
boy-meets-girl love story.

03:28.358 --> 03:32.262
Except at night, the
boy turns into a horse.

03:32.296 --> 03:35.014
Every girl loves boys and horses.

03:35.049 --> 03:38.284
But only one could tame them both.

03:38.319 --> 03:41.671
But only one...
could tame them both.

03:41.705 --> 03:45.341
W-wow,
well, color me intrigued.

03:45.376 --> 03:48.628
Yeah, I am going to read that...

03:48.662 --> 03:50.813
as soon as you have a copy.

03:50.848 --> 03:53.416
I'll just... well, look
right there, you have one.

03:53.450 --> 03:57.203
Mane attraction, and
you spelled it m-a-n-e.

03:57.238 --> 04:03.192
- It's a pun.
- So it behooves me to read your "tail."

04:03.226 --> 04:04.327
What does that mean?
Why are you talking like that?

04:04.361 --> 04:05.762
Okay. Never mind.

04:05.796 --> 04:08.864
Seeing as how you're an English
teacher and my best friend,

04:08.883 --> 04:10.884
I would really love
to get your feedback.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.101
Don't you mean "feed bag"?

04:12.136 --> 04:13.403
- What?
- 'Cause of the hor...

04:13.437 --> 04:16.372
<i>Never mind.
I'm gonna shut up now.</i>

04:16.390 --> 04:17.724
Oh, you... you were thinking
I'd read this right now?

04:17.757 --> 04:18.992
- Yeah.
- Because I was gonna

04:19.026 --> 04:20.410
put my skirt on and then head to work.

04:20.444 --> 04:23.245
Oh, yeah, fine, whenever.
Whenever you get a chance.

04:23.264 --> 04:27.033
But make it today, okay?
And I'm not so sure about that skirt.

04:27.067 --> 04:32.055
There's a little feedback for you,
and it didn't take me all day.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.307
<i>Okay.</i>

04:34.341 --> 04:38.645
I'm up to flyer some campuses
about my intern gig.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.563
Life's weird, huh?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.966
It's only been a few months, and
I'm already growing my company.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.818
- ♪Blessed.
- Cool. Let's go.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.738
Oh, Graham, with all due respect,
this is grown man stuff.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.774
- I can't have you tagging along.
- Mom said you have to watch me today.

04:51.809 --> 04:52.825
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.310
Well, maybe I could just...

04:54.345 --> 04:55.678
You can't leave me
with the doorman again.

04:55.713 --> 04:56.980
Damn it!

04:57.014 --> 04:59.673
How is anybody supposed to take
You-Search. Netbeta

04:59.705 --> 05:02.652
seriously with you following me
around messing everything up?

05:02.670 --> 05:05.939
- Come on, let's go.
- Your flyers.

05:05.973 --> 05:10.326
Thanks.
This is so unfair.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.396
All right, tango.
We're here to lay down voice-over

05:13.430 --> 05:14.564
on the fiscal crisis
piece I'm working on.

05:14.598 --> 05:15.698
Sounds boring, right?

05:15.732 --> 05:17.133
- I got a voice mail...
- Wrong.

05:17.167 --> 05:19.035
The work we do today
will affect real change.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.904
- What do I get to do?
- Well, when I do a take I like,

05:21.939 --> 05:26.542
- you circle it on this page.
- I feel like Nelson Mandela.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.545
She knows her world history.

05:32.967 --> 05:34.670
<i>Okay, Phil, we rolling?</i>

05:34.671 --> 05:36.373
My name's Todd.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.688
I've been here 15
years, but to these guys,

05:38.722 --> 05:40.473
I'm just a button pusher.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.891
<i>I'm ready, Phil. Push the button.</i>

05:41.925 --> 05:45.861
<i>But due to budget cuts, the city's
had to scale back on library hours.</i>

05:45.879 --> 05:49.765
- Cut. We got it.
- Oh, cool. We're done.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.368
- You'd think that.
- All right. We got the rough sketch.

05:52.402 --> 05:53.886
<i>Now let's break out the paintbrushes.</i>

05:53.921 --> 05:55.054
We're gonna be ordering dinner.

05:55.089 --> 05:57.073
- Budget cuts...
- Bored yet?

05:57.107 --> 05:59.625
Oh. No, no.
This is fascinating.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.011
And after this, he's gonna
show me how to log tapes.

06:02.046 --> 06:04.647
Oh, yeah, I have a trick
to get you out of that.

06:04.682 --> 06:06.816
Accidentally spill
coffee on the tape machine?

06:06.834 --> 06:08.317
You're close. No, use fresca.

06:08.335 --> 06:11.104
It's clear, unscented, and always
around because nobody drinks it.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.822
<i>Due to budget cuts, the city's
had to scale back library hours.</i>

06:12.856 --> 06:14.690
<i>I can't hear you. What's
going on out there?</i>

06:14.708 --> 06:16.759
Nothing. Sounding
good in there, Mike.

06:16.794 --> 06:18.961
<i>If "good" were good enough, they
wouldn't have invented "great".</i>

06:18.979 --> 06:22.231
<i>Phil, I think I need to
hit library harder. Library.</i>

06:22.249 --> 06:23.716
- Li-brary.
- Okay.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.169
Let's get you out of here
and find you something

06:26.203 --> 06:27.970
- more interesting to do.
- Library.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.605
- Uh, am I allowed to?
- Library.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.575
Well, sure, unless you
wanna stick around for this.

06:32.609 --> 06:35.745
- Library, library.
- Let's go.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.381
- Library.
- Hey, Phil, keep up the good work.

06:38.415 --> 06:40.916
- Maybe my name is Phil.
- Library.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.636
<i>Library. I cracked it.
I just have to throw away library.</i>

06:43.687 --> 06:48.090
<i>All right, Eve.
Get out that circling pen. Eve?</i>

06:48.108 --> 06:50.777
<i>Eve?
[yelps]</i>

06:50.811 --> 06:54.276
<i>I shouldn't have gone with a
12-foot cord. Phil, cut me loose.</i>

06:55.557 --> 06:57.656
<i>It was amazing.
Susan took me out for</i>

06:57.657 --> 06:59.756
a long lunch,
and we talked for hours.

06:59.790 --> 07:01.224
She said tomorrow,

07:01.259 --> 07:02.759
maybe I could pitch her
some of my story ideas.

07:02.794 --> 07:05.812
- Honey, that's unbelievable.
- I know, right?

07:05.847 --> 07:07.597
You know, I thought I
was just gonna hate this,

07:07.615 --> 07:10.834
- but it's been great.
- That's great, honey.

07:10.852 --> 07:12.436
That's just great. Really great.

07:12.470 --> 07:15.055
- It's been a freakin' nightmare.
- Sounds like somebody's upset

07:15.089 --> 07:16.890
he's not getting his
daddy-daughter time.

07:16.941 --> 07:20.527
Susan stole her from me!
I mean, we had a truce.

07:20.561 --> 07:21.911
Did you get her to spit
in her hand and shake on it?

07:21.929 --> 07:23.563
Because otherwise it doesn't count.

07:23.614 --> 07:25.432
No, that's crazy.
And I didn't think of it.

07:25.466 --> 07:27.751
What is this?
What are you reading?

07:27.785 --> 07:29.486
Is that a picture of
a horse eating a human being?

07:29.520 --> 07:32.139
No, no, no, no, no.
He's becoming a human being.

07:32.173 --> 07:33.890
See how his mane is kind of morphing

07:33.925 --> 07:36.192
into a fauxhawk?
Because, see... I'm sorry.

07:36.210 --> 07:38.128
I don't even know why I'm
trying to sell this to you.

07:38.162 --> 07:41.064
Leigh gave me the first
chapter of her new book,

07:41.098 --> 07:44.751
and she wants feedback.
[laughs]

07:44.786 --> 07:47.938
- You know this isn't gonna end well.
- No. She hates getting criticism.

07:47.972 --> 07:50.023
Remember one time I told her
an Evite she wrote was confusing?

07:50.058 --> 07:52.709
- She walked into the ocean.
- That was not a good picnic.

07:52.744 --> 07:55.312
I usually have no problem
telling people the hard truth.

07:55.346 --> 07:57.464
It's just that Leigh is my kryptonite.

07:57.498 --> 07:59.916
Well, the thing is Leigh
doesn't want feedback.

07:59.934 --> 08:02.385
Leigh wants compliments, so just
tell her what she wants to hear.

08:02.403 --> 08:07.190
- Wow. Mike, that is brilliant.
- Thank you.

08:07.224 --> 08:09.326
You know, you're not
just a husband to me.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.863
- You're also something of a mentor.
- Well, thank you, honey.

08:12.897 --> 08:17.768
I try my best to g... wait a minute.
You just did it to me!

08:20.922 --> 08:23.607
So I hear Eve's coming in to
"pitch you some stories."

08:23.641 --> 08:25.459
I'm not good at air
quotes, but they're there.

08:25.493 --> 08:27.110
Surely you're not implying

08:27.128 --> 08:29.096
that I'm trying to
"turn her against you."

08:29.147 --> 08:30.880
Oh... oh, look. You see that?

08:30.898 --> 08:32.832
- That's how they work.
- I know what you're doing.

08:32.866 --> 08:36.553
You're using her to get to me,
which is low, even for you.

08:36.587 --> 08:39.990
My god, this is comfortable. Is this
what sitting's supposed to feel like?

08:40.024 --> 08:43.927
- Are you sitting? I couldn't tell.
- We had a truce.

08:43.945 --> 08:45.762
And then you go... and seriously,

08:45.797 --> 08:47.831
- how much did this cost?
- Oh, I don't know.

08:47.849 --> 08:50.183
The station paid for it,
which reminds me,

08:50.218 --> 08:51.768
we're not having a
Christmas party this year.

08:51.786 --> 08:54.370
<i>Look, your daughter
is a really smart girl.</i>

08:54.388 --> 08:56.106
I think she can choose for herself.

08:56.140 --> 08:59.409
But if you think you can win her back,
by all means, go for it.

08:59.443 --> 09:01.878
I'm her father, Susan.
I'm not gonna play some

09:01.879 --> 09:04.314
stupid game in order to
win back my own daughter.

09:04.348 --> 09:06.917
- Okay.
- I need a helicopter.

09:06.951 --> 09:08.401
- For what?
- For my story.

09:08.436 --> 09:10.854
For the library thing?
You need a helicopter

09:10.872 --> 09:12.806
for a story on budgetary redistribution?

09:12.840 --> 09:14.424
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you
the news reporter now?

09:14.458 --> 09:15.758
Well, I think it's
a valid question, Mike,

09:15.776 --> 09:17.160
because libraries are on the ground.

09:17.194 --> 09:18.662
<i>Well, it has to do
with square footage.</i>

09:18.696 --> 09:20.496
Bird's-eye view, vantage points.

09:20.515 --> 09:22.065
What, are you gonna
stand here grilling me,

09:22.099 --> 09:23.033
or do you want me up in the
sky, winning you an Emmy?

09:23.067 --> 09:25.468
Well, I do love Emmys.

09:25.503 --> 09:27.604
What am I supposed to do,
pull the traffic copter?

09:27.638 --> 09:29.322
Well, "this just in.
West side highway is packed."

09:29.357 --> 09:31.208
Same as usual.
Run footage from yesterday.

09:31.242 --> 09:32.459
- All right.
- All right.

09:32.493 --> 09:34.644
But listen, if an escaped
panda wanders into traffic

09:34.645 --> 09:36.796
and I'm caught with my
pants down, it's on you.

09:36.831 --> 09:38.448
<i>While I'm finishing up my master's</i>

09:38.466 --> 09:39.883
in computer science,
I wanna get some real

09:39.901 --> 09:41.318
boots-on-the-ground
experience.

09:41.352 --> 09:44.321
- So where are your offices?
- Well, we're on the upper West Side.

09:44.355 --> 09:46.356
<i>Great facility, wi-fi, stocked kitchen.</i>

09:46.390 --> 09:50.126
We do have to keep it down after 10:00
because it doubles as a residence.

09:50.160 --> 09:53.113
- So it's your parents' place?
- They live there too.

09:53.147 --> 09:55.365
And how many employees do you have?

09:55.383 --> 10:01.738
We're a small outfit.
Right now it's me and...

10:01.772 --> 10:05.041
just me, actually.
And you, if you're lucky.

10:05.059 --> 10:08.078
So it would be me and you
in your childhood bedroom.

10:08.112 --> 10:11.214
Actually, it's this
little guy's bedroom.

10:11.249 --> 10:13.984
But apple started in a garage.
HP started in a garage.

10:14.018 --> 10:17.520
General Motors started in a garage.
For obvious reasons.

10:17.555 --> 10:21.675
Will you excuse me for just one sec?
I have to use the bathroom.

10:21.709 --> 10:24.627
- I like him.
- I like him too.

10:24.645 --> 10:28.665
He's pretty much an insta-hire.
[bell on door jingles]

10:28.699 --> 10:31.768
But you don't wanna marry
the first girl you dance with.

10:31.786 --> 10:35.639
- Dad did.
- He's lying about that. Grow up.

10:41.462 --> 10:42.629
[screams]

10:42.680 --> 10:43.730
What did you think of the book?

10:43.764 --> 10:47.784
- Fire away.
- Home run. I mean, like...

10:47.818 --> 10:48.899
[imitates bat hitting ball]

10:48.920 --> 10:50.253
[whistles]

10:50.271 --> 10:53.456
Wow. Okay, so that's that.
How about we go get a drink?

10:53.490 --> 10:55.675
Hold on.
Tell me what you liked about it.

10:55.710 --> 11:00.330
Uh, what I liked about it.
Okay, well, the beginning just...

11:00.364 --> 11:02.282
it started the whole thing off.

11:02.316 --> 11:06.319
And then the middle took us
from the beginning right to the end.

11:06.354 --> 11:09.672
Which stayed true to its name

11:09.690 --> 11:12.092
because there was nothing after that.

11:12.126 --> 11:14.728
So I think we should
go get that drink now.

11:14.762 --> 11:16.980
- You didn't read it.
- No, I did, I did.

11:16.998 --> 11:20.750
- I-I loved it.
- Name one specific thing you loved.

11:20.768 --> 11:23.270
- Just one... one specific thing.
- Just one thing. Anything at all.

11:23.304 --> 11:26.640
- I-I c... I can't.
- You can't because you didn't read it!

11:26.674 --> 11:28.692
I can't because it is terrible!

11:28.726 --> 11:31.378
You have two major
characters named Kristen.

11:31.412 --> 11:33.747
There are entire paragraphs
in horse language,

11:33.781 --> 11:35.899
and the stuff in English
makes even less sense.

11:35.933 --> 11:37.534
And then you describe every character as

11:37.535 --> 11:41.121
"if this celebrity and
that celebrity had a baby."

11:44.342 --> 11:47.160
Well, thanks for the feedback.

11:47.194 --> 11:50.689
I feel that maybe you should

11:50.690 --> 11:54.184
try writing about what you know

11:54.218 --> 11:59.739
instead of writing about a horse
that turns into a boy.

11:59.790 --> 12:04.223
It's about a boy...
who turns into a horse.

12:08.799 --> 12:10.533
We need you to wear
something that says,

12:10.568 --> 12:15.555
"I'm 22, I'm on my first job,
and I need a drink."

12:15.589 --> 12:18.007
We could get t-shirts printed.

12:18.025 --> 12:22.045
Susan decided that I'd be perfect
for an expose on underage drinking.

12:22.063 --> 12:24.764
And I decided that was
just a little better

12:24.799 --> 12:29.369
than listening to Dad say "library"
over and over again.

12:29.403 --> 12:32.288
I can't believe I'm going undercover.
It... it feels so dangerous.

12:32.323 --> 12:34.874
No, going undercover as
a drug mule is dangerous.

12:34.909 --> 12:37.360
I swallowed 20 condoms full
of cocaine. One of them burst.

12:37.395 --> 12:41.798
Ooh, that was a crazy night in Juarez.
What about green?

12:41.832 --> 12:44.818
[knock on wall]

12:44.852 --> 12:46.820
Go ahead.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.992
- What's going on?
- You is going on. A helicopter ride.

12:53.044 --> 12:54.210
Come on, it's waiting for us upstairs.

12:54.245 --> 12:56.596
Oh, Dad, I can't.
I'm helping Susan with a story.

12:56.630 --> 12:59.849
- I might even be on air.
- On air? Is that what she told you?

12:59.867 --> 13:02.669
Honey, Susan doesn't need your help.
She's just using you to get to me.

13:02.720 --> 13:06.423
- Oh, so this is all about you?
- Yes, you're finally getting it.

13:06.457 --> 13:07.890
Wow, and here I thought
Susan might have seen

13:07.908 --> 13:09.359
some potential in me.

13:09.393 --> 13:11.378
Honey, I can see how
you might think that,

13:11.412 --> 13:13.713
but you're just a hapless pawn.
[scoffs]

13:13.748 --> 13:15.765
A hapless pawn that's
going on a helicopter ride.

13:15.800 --> 13:19.319
- Sorry. I've got work to do.
- Eve...

13:19.354 --> 13:22.127
What are you still doing down here?
You're supposed to be up in the air.

13:22.162 --> 13:24.207
- I just need a minute.
- Uh, you don't have a minute.

13:24.241 --> 13:25.575
Do you know how much fuel
that helicopter burns through?

13:25.593 --> 13:28.378
A dinosaur a day. Now, I'm not
talking about the small ones

13:28.412 --> 13:29.929
that spit in your
face and go... [hisses]

13:29.964 --> 13:31.631
I'm talking about the
big, swoopy neck ones.

13:31.682 --> 13:32.915
You promised me a story,
Mike. Come on, let's go.

13:32.933 --> 13:36.302
- But I need my intern.
- Take Doug.

13:36.353 --> 13:41.591
Just so you're aware, my stomach
is not great with air travel.

13:41.609 --> 13:44.611
Then for the love of god,
stop eating the calzone.

13:44.645 --> 13:45.937
Come on.

13:47.113 --> 13:49.815
<i>You don't be need
eating a calzone.</i>

13:53.193 --> 13:55.967
- Did you get the story?
- Let me put it to you this way.

13:56.030 --> 13:57.692
Can you puke out the
window of a helicopter?

13:57.726 --> 13:59.110
The answer may surprise you.

13:59.128 --> 14:01.462
Oh, you got throw
up in the helicopter?

14:01.497 --> 14:03.081
I'll go get my febreze.

14:03.115 --> 14:05.016
Wait, have you seen Eve?
I need to talk to her.

14:05.050 --> 14:07.518
Oh, well, she's at Darwin's
bar and grill with Susan.

14:07.552 --> 14:09.287
- She's at a bar?
- And grill.

14:09.321 --> 14:12.423
- Susan.
- Where do we keep the spare shirts?

14:12.457 --> 14:14.692
- Doug.
- Don't worry, I'll get 'em.

14:14.727 --> 14:17.662
[grumbles]

14:17.696 --> 14:18.746
Okay, we got a full
plate this afternoon.

14:18.797 --> 14:20.364
Where's that stack of resumes?

14:20.382 --> 14:23.033
For your blood sugar.
You haven't eaten lunch.

14:23.052 --> 14:25.269
Hey there. Ian Henry.
Pleasure's yours.

14:25.304 --> 14:26.904
[laughs]
So let's jump right in.

14:26.939 --> 14:28.656
What do you feel you
can offer my company?

14:28.691 --> 14:31.325
I'm just looking for the can, dude.

14:34.713 --> 14:39.167
In a nutshell, my career
goals include housing,

14:39.201 --> 14:42.637
- sandwich...
- I think this interview's over.

14:42.671 --> 14:46.257
Don't worry, man.
I won't do stuff to ya.

14:48.393 --> 14:50.661
You know, I'm really impressed
with what I heard so far.

14:50.696 --> 14:52.630
I think this could be a good fit.

14:52.664 --> 14:54.498
Well, I just have a few
more people to interview,

14:54.516 --> 14:58.236
- so we'll let you know.
- What? I was interviewing you.

14:58.270 --> 15:01.622
- No, I was interviewing you.
- Oh, well, how'd I do?

15:01.673 --> 15:05.259
Think we're gonna go
in a different direction.

15:05.294 --> 15:08.396
[bell on door jingles]
Oh, come on!

15:08.430 --> 15:10.715
<i>[knocks on door]</i>

15:10.749 --> 15:14.585
<i>Leigh?</i>

15:14.619 --> 15:17.421
Leigh? You all right?

15:21.026 --> 15:22.727
Oh, god.

15:22.761 --> 15:24.162
I shouldn't have been honest with her.

15:24.196 --> 15:26.831
Now all that was left
was for me to apologize

15:26.865 --> 15:28.950
and hope she didn't ask me
anything else about her book,

15:28.984 --> 15:32.003
because I kind of held back.

15:32.037 --> 15:33.103
Leigh?

15:33.122 --> 15:37.225
Hey, lady.
Didn't hear you.

15:37.259 --> 15:39.560
I can only write to jock jams.

15:39.595 --> 15:41.295
- Wait, you're writing?
- Oh, yeah.

15:41.330 --> 15:43.147
I'm almost through my second draft.

15:43.165 --> 15:46.116
Wow, that's... that's unexpected.

15:46.135 --> 15:47.585
Look, what you said was harsh,

15:47.619 --> 15:49.420
but after I took down
a box of taco shells,

15:49.454 --> 15:52.389
I started rewriting,
and I haven't stopped.

15:52.407 --> 15:53.941
Honey, that's great!

15:53.992 --> 15:57.078
Oh, th... oh, your...
your gums are bleeding.

15:57.112 --> 15:58.896
How fast did you eat those things?

15:58.931 --> 16:00.848
I was like a wood chipper.
[imitates wood chipper]

16:00.883 --> 16:02.383
[laughs]

16:02.434 --> 16:05.186
That felt good.
For once, I was honest with Leigh,

16:05.220 --> 16:06.971
and nothing terrible happened.

16:07.005 --> 16:09.574
But since you were kinda
harsh on me, it would really

16:09.575 --> 16:12.143
mean a lot if I could
read my book to your class.

16:12.177 --> 16:14.595
Oh...

16:14.630 --> 16:17.081
The feeling didn't last long.
But what the hell?

16:17.115 --> 16:20.735
She's my good friend, and it will
be a valuable experience for her.

16:20.769 --> 16:23.247
Plus I get that hour off.

16:24.706 --> 16:26.357
Excuse me?

16:26.375 --> 16:28.626
I'll have a Manhattan Up,
two cherries on a sword.

16:28.660 --> 16:30.761
Uh-huh. How old are you?

16:30.796 --> 16:32.180
- 22.
- What year were you born?

16:32.231 --> 16:33.648
- '91.
- Month and day.

16:33.682 --> 16:35.483
- January 19.
- So you're a virgo?

16:35.534 --> 16:37.618
Capricorn. The goat.

16:37.653 --> 16:42.761
- Stubborn, yet ambitious.
- Manhattan Up it is.

16:43.463 --> 16:46.243
- All right, let's go.
- Dad?

16:46.261 --> 16:47.712
I can't.
I'm in the middle of something.

16:47.746 --> 16:50.431
<i>Manhattan Up,
two cherries on a sword.</i>

16:50.482 --> 16:52.350
What, are you drinking now?
What the hell, Eve?

16:52.384 --> 16:54.352
<i>[whispering]
Mike, Mike, Mike, keep it down.</i>

16:54.386 --> 16:56.904
<i>We're doing an expose
on underage drinking.</i>

16:56.939 --> 16:59.156
Oh, we are? Well, where
the hell are the cameras?

16:59.190 --> 17:02.743
- The camera is in my button.
- Oh, right, of course. Button cam.

17:02.794 --> 17:04.412
- It's real, Dad.
- Is it?

17:04.463 --> 17:06.414
I've been in the news for 20 years.
Maybe I'm wrong.

17:06.464 --> 17:08.866
Maybe anything can be a camera.
Maybe this spoon can be a camera.

17:08.884 --> 17:10.367
Hello, spoon.
Are you getting this?

17:10.385 --> 17:11.535
- Stay informed.
- Keep rolling.

17:11.553 --> 17:14.888
How about this?
Maybe this cherry's a camera. Hello.

17:14.923 --> 17:19.760
Oh, my god, I ate a camera.
Stand by for pictures of my colon.

17:19.810 --> 17:21.712
<i>You really want me to
believe that's a camera?</i>

17:21.730 --> 17:23.380
<i>Hello, Mom, I'm on TV.</i>

17:23.397 --> 17:25.933
I put that man in
charge of a helicopter.

17:25.968 --> 17:27.800
Well, technically,
I was also in the heli...

17:27.836 --> 17:28.653
Doug!

17:28.671 --> 17:30.579
<i>...recording me, why don't
I put on a little show?</i>

17:30.614 --> 17:32.753
<i>[singing gibberish]</i>

17:33.751 --> 17:36.655
<i>I'm supposed to believe we
have nanosurveillance technology</i>

17:36.656 --> 17:38.592
<i>with the tech guys we've got?</i>

17:38.653 --> 17:40.971
Knocked it out of the park, Phil.

17:40.989 --> 17:45.242
It's Todd.
It's always been Todd.

17:47.479 --> 17:50.197
So I guess that's the
end of my news career.

17:50.248 --> 17:51.982
Oh, no, no, you
were great on the tape,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.368
before that crazy guy
busted in and wrecked it.

17:54.419 --> 17:57.905
- I wouldn't know. I'm just a pawn.
- I'm sorry.

17:57.939 --> 18:00.091
Sometimes I still think
of you as a little girl.

18:00.125 --> 18:02.259
But the truth is what
you are now is way better.

18:02.294 --> 18:05.046
<i>And I shouldn't have said the only
reason someone would wanna work</i>

18:05.047 --> 18:07.965
- with you is to get to me.
- Oh, no, Susan was definitely

18:07.999 --> 18:10.885
using me to get to you, but...
I was using her too.

18:10.936 --> 18:14.138
I got to do a pretty cool story,
and I got some new clothes.

18:14.172 --> 18:17.641
- And you almost got a free drink.
- Right. Almost.

18:17.675 --> 18:19.343
Oh, god, you're as bad as she is.

18:19.361 --> 18:23.147
If you still wanna work with Susan,
I won't stand in your way.

18:23.181 --> 18:24.815
<i>Truth is she's a pretty
damn good reporter.</i>

18:24.849 --> 18:26.317
I taught her everything she knows.

18:26.351 --> 18:28.519
- Are you sure?
- Not even a little bit.

18:28.537 --> 18:32.356
This might help you feel better.

18:34.126 --> 18:36.160

Orange.

18:43.368 --> 18:45.169
Sorry you couldn't find an intern.

18:45.203 --> 18:47.972
Oh, it was just a wasted day
at an overpriced coffee shop.

18:48.006 --> 18:51.175
But on the upside, I memorized
Alison Krauss's new album.

18:51.209 --> 18:53.144
<i>You know, I thought
bringing on an employee</i>

18:53.178 --> 18:54.678

more like a company.</i>

18:54.712 --> 18:56.647
But I think I gotta
walk this road on my own.

18:56.681 --> 18:59.173
That'd make a great lyric
for an Alison Krauss song.

18:59.208 --> 19:01.727
- Yes, it would.
- Well, I guess I better

19:01.728 --> 19:07.858
- throw out all those resumes.
- Already did it. Except for this one.

19:07.892 --> 19:12.396
What kind of idiot
does this in crayon?

19:12.414 --> 19:15.699
Son of a gun, you've
been helping me all along.

19:15.733 --> 19:18.569
My number's on there.

Maybe Leigh's a better writer
than I give her credit for.

19:42.944 --> 19:45.429
Or maybe they just loved
it because it was filthy.

Kristen replied."
