00:53.120 --> 00:54.253
[beeps]

00:57.324 --> 00:58.490
[beeps]

01:02.396 --> 01:03.629
[beeps]

01:03.631 --> 01:05.297
[mechanical hiss]

01:19.580 --> 01:20.746
Gentlemen.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.350
Our treasure is untouched.

01:29.190 --> 01:34.860
The most expensive,
privately owned collection
of rare coins

01:34.862 --> 01:36.595
is still ours.

01:36.597 --> 01:40.365
Rossini Enterprises
has based its business

01:40.367 --> 01:41.834
on this collateral that

01:41.836 --> 01:46.371
has allowed us to become
as rich as we are today.

01:46.373 --> 01:50.175
There is no Wall Street collapse
or economic crisis

01:50.177 --> 01:53.345
that will ever
undermine its value.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.166
We're running out of time.

02:49.236 --> 02:51.336
We're always ready. Copy.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.277
I have everything you need.

03:34.448 --> 03:37.482
I hope so.
You already confirmed delivery.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.651
They're all inside.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.278
You can count them
if you want.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.582
No problem.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.654
I trust you.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.553
[shouts]

05:54.555 --> 05:56.121
[grunting]

06:30.157 --> 06:31.556
Quit!

06:40.768 --> 06:42.634
[straining]

06:47.508 --> 06:48.540
[grunts]

07:06.093 --> 07:08.927
[panting]

07:12.132 --> 07:13.632
[man shouts]

07:32.753 --> 07:33.985
[Russian man] Drop it.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.190
I said, drop it.

07:42.830 --> 07:46.598
This is why
I always carry two.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.766
Now walk.

07:49.536 --> 07:50.836
Walk.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.103
Walk.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.674
Stop.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.478
Drop the guns
or I kill him!

08:00.881 --> 08:04.182
I said,
drop the guns or I kill him!

08:05.853 --> 08:07.719
[in Italian]

08:09.823 --> 08:11.122
[Russian man in English]
Walk back.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.160
Walk.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.736
You drive.

09:12.553 --> 09:13.618
[grunts]

09:13.620 --> 09:15.754
[breathing heavily]

09:19.092 --> 09:20.225
Thanks.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.560
You're welcome.

09:41.815 --> 09:42.948
Drop the weapon.

09:45.786 --> 09:46.985
Interpol.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.322
Can I show you
my badge?

09:50.324 --> 09:51.690
[officer] Where is it?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.091
Back pocket.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.100
Are you gonna stay there
for a while?

10:02.102 --> 10:04.703
-Okay. There.
-[woman] Can I relax now?

10:04.705 --> 10:05.870
Yeah.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.651
You just screwed up
a joint operation

10:19.653 --> 10:22.954
to capture
an international network
of arms dealers.

10:22.956 --> 10:26.124
The screw-up comes
from your office.
We haven't been briefed.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.327
Are we free to go?

10:30.864 --> 10:32.664
[captain whistles]
[man] Are we free to go?

10:33.667 --> 10:35.000
[in Italian]

10:43.010 --> 10:44.209
[clears throat]

10:44.211 --> 10:45.377
[in English] Let me.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.347
May I?
Yeah.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.754
Well, they're not gonna
be selling any more guns.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.756
We'll never get
to their supplier.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.260
What about the clients
who bought the gun stuff?

11:03.864 --> 11:05.864
We should debrief
before you go.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.036
I'll write my report
tomorrow.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.338
I've got a marriage to save.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.908
[sighs] And...

11:16.910 --> 11:19.844
And?
My daughter's gonna
be there.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.048
I didn't know
you had a daughter.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.884
Yeah. I haven't seen her
for quite some time now.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.754
Quite some time.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.366
All right.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.334
Uh, how do I look?
[laughs]

11:44.237 --> 11:45.770
Handsome.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.140
Well, good luck
with your wife.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.109
And your daughter.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.808
[indistinct chatter]

12:41.027 --> 12:43.161
Do you always go
to parties like this?

12:43.163 --> 12:45.063
Once in a while.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.765
Part of my business.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.301
Fell two floors.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.203
[women chuckle]

12:52.205 --> 12:53.404
Beg your pardon.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.913
He's cute.
Can't argue with that.

13:05.051 --> 13:06.951
Mary.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.554
You look lovely as always.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.156
Who's your friend?

13:11.158 --> 13:14.359
Diana,
my husband's daughter.

13:14.361 --> 13:17.896
And Gabriele.
Gabriele Damiani.

13:17.898 --> 13:20.031
So nice to make
your acquaintance.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.435
Is Michael
joining us tonight?
Maybe.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.138
Yeah, right.
He's working as usual.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.909
I haven't seen my father
in four years, and he still
can't make it in time.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.277
Diana.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.245
Well, I will see you later.

13:41.855 --> 13:44.522
I've been told that Gabriele
has been hovering around.

13:44.524 --> 13:48.459
If that's hovering,
I'm terrified what
a full-scale attack would be.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.930
Handsome, wealthy, single.
What's the problem?

13:53.133 --> 13:54.933
I'm married.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.001
You're separated.

13:57.003 --> 14:00.138
Meaning, go check if the grass
is greener on the other side.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.175
You and Michael got married
way too young.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.312
-Enjoy this while you can.
-[phone rings]

14:07.314 --> 14:10.048
Ah. Speak of the devil.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.183
What excuse will it be
this time?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.552
Hi, Michael.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.422
Yeah. Diana's here.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.360
-Do you think security
can let him in?
-Do I have to?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.561
Sara.

14:25.332 --> 14:28.032
Okay. Yeah,
she's right on it.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.468
See you soon. Bye.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.982
Mary. Hi.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.519
Wow, you look great.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.622
And you look
pretty good yourself.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.591
So... [clears throat]

14:53.593 --> 14:55.526
So where's-- where's Diana?

14:58.298 --> 14:59.597
Hi, Diana.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.337
Oh. Hmm...

15:08.308 --> 15:11.943
Wow, you're--
Dad, I missed you so much.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.412
Yeah, I missed you too.

15:14.414 --> 15:18.249
It's silly of me.
It's not silly.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.552
It's not silly missing your dad.
It's all right. Don't worry.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.655
[Diana]
I just wish we could
see each other more.

15:23.657 --> 15:25.290
Yeah, me too. Me too.

15:25.292 --> 15:29.294
Hey, sorry I was late.
I got held up at work.

15:31.364 --> 15:34.098
Look at you. [chuckles]

15:34.100 --> 15:37.201
Wow, you look beautiful.
What happened? You grew up.
You got so big.

15:37.203 --> 15:40.138
Let me see. My pet.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.074
Come here. Come here.
No one's called me pet
in a long time.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.410
Yes. You're gonna be
my little girl.
Shall we?

15:45.412 --> 15:48.313
Okay, let's go.
Let's check it out. Come on.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.182
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:51.184 --> 15:53.284
if I can have a moment
of your attention.

15:55.322 --> 15:59.257
After two years of strong sales,
continued expansion...

15:59.259 --> 16:02.694
Wait. How old are you now?
What are you, 12? No, 24?

16:02.696 --> 16:05.430
She's 29.
[chuckles]

16:05.432 --> 16:09.968
[Rossini] I can safely say
that we have emerged
out of the crisis.

16:10.570 --> 16:14.072
[guests applauding]

16:14.975 --> 16:16.641
Thank you.

16:16.643 --> 16:21.346
Rossini Industries
is investing heavily
in new technologies

16:21.348 --> 16:24.315
to stay well ahead
of these important trends.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.454
Please, sir.
Sorry.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.489
Madam.
[Michael]
I'm sorry. Excuse us.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.724
Sorry.

16:35.028 --> 16:38.529
Like every one of us,
I like to see...

16:39.599 --> 16:42.600
some profits
of our enterprises.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.502
But on one condition:

16:44.504 --> 16:46.704
respecting the world we live in.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.375
Respect for the environment,

16:50.377 --> 16:53.644
the people, plants,
and animals that live
on this beautiful planet.

16:55.515 --> 17:00.518
This is a major concern of mine
and of our enterprises.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.439
[in Italian]

17:21.441 --> 17:22.573
[muffled gunshot]

18:12.725 --> 18:15.426
[muffled gunshots]

19:06.913 --> 19:08.246
[in English] Come in.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.203
[grunting]

20:06.673 --> 20:08.606
Let's go. Come on, come on.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.779
-[gunmen shout]
-[guests scream]

20:14.781 --> 20:15.846
What's going on?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.427
Sit down!

20:29.429 --> 20:32.463
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.900
My apologies
for the interruption.

20:35.902 --> 20:40.238
My men and I are going
to be here for a few hours.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.407
We expect your full cooperation.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.742
What do you want?

20:45.511 --> 20:47.645
You, come here.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.413
[Sara] Me?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.748
She stays with me!

20:51.985 --> 20:54.885
You're in no position
to bargain,

20:54.887 --> 20:57.955
no matter how much
you love your daughter.

20:57.957 --> 21:01.292
Miss Sara Rossini, please.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.053
How did you know?

21:31.924 --> 21:33.357
Who told you?

21:43.603 --> 21:48.773
I'm going to ask all of you
to follow my men upstairs.

21:48.775 --> 21:51.942
You'll be divided
in groups of ten

21:51.944 --> 21:56.614
and kept as prisoners
until the end of the operation.

21:58.751 --> 22:02.420
[gunmen shout indistinctly]

22:22.608 --> 22:24.575
[women scream]

22:28.014 --> 22:30.881
Let's go. It's fine. It's okay.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.050
It's okay, it's okay.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.587
Stop.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.106
[Mary screams]

23:04.917 --> 23:06.083
Copy.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.770
[whispering]
Diana. Let's go.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.082
Leave him.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.018
I'm a doctor.

24:14.020 --> 24:17.121
I'm a soldier,
and it suits me to see him die.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.457
You bastard.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.092
Thank you.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.829
You go upstairs with the others.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.567
Take him away.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.674
How do you know about this room?

24:36.676 --> 24:37.875
Ah!

24:48.254 --> 24:51.088
[breathing heavily]

25:11.244 --> 25:13.010
Give me your phone.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.846
Give me your phone!
Come on.

25:17.517 --> 25:18.649
Come on!

25:20.720 --> 25:21.852
Go.

25:28.594 --> 25:29.727
Dad.

25:30.530 --> 25:31.662
Look.

25:59.859 --> 26:02.860
[grunting]

26:14.941 --> 26:17.141
[phone rings]

26:20.179 --> 26:22.046
You screwed it up already?

26:22.048 --> 26:23.714
Scott.

26:23.716 --> 26:27.217
You have to get the team
down to the Rossini villa, ASAP.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.253
We've got a hostage situation.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.155
Details?
What's going on?

26:31.157 --> 26:33.123
[sighs]
Fifteen to 20 armed men.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.725
<i> About 50 hostages.</i>

26:34.727 --> 26:36.060
We need backup.

26:36.062 --> 26:38.028
No. Mary's in there.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.229
What about your daughter?

26:39.231 --> 26:40.831
She's with me.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.666
Copy that.
With you in 20 minutes.

26:50.843 --> 26:53.243
Okay.

26:53.245 --> 26:56.146
We're gonna have
to get you safe first.
You have to go by yourself.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.015
Yes.
Go to the village.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.750
Where's your cell phone?

26:59.752 --> 27:01.318
I lost my purse.

27:02.888 --> 27:05.356
Okay. All right.

27:05.358 --> 27:10.361
Here's some money.
Go down, find a hotel,
a restaurant.

27:10.363 --> 27:11.729
Call me when you get there.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.697
All right?
Okay.

27:13.699 --> 27:15.733
Okay, here we go. So...

27:16.936 --> 27:18.936
You'll be fine, all right?

27:23.776 --> 27:24.908
Okay?

27:25.645 --> 27:26.910
Okay.

27:27.947 --> 27:29.313
Talk to you soon.

27:44.430 --> 27:45.996
Lock the perimeter.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.442
[machine beeps, hums]

28:06.385 --> 28:09.386
[beeping continues]

28:16.962 --> 28:18.128
Stop.

28:27.740 --> 28:30.741
Goro. Two are fucking down.

28:40.886 --> 28:43.787
Did you find the keys?
<i> No, sir.</i>

28:51.964 --> 28:53.097
Stop!

28:56.268 --> 28:57.735
Move!

29:00.773 --> 29:03.207
Come on! I said move!

29:13.018 --> 29:15.753
You stay back. Be gentle.

29:15.755 --> 29:19.523
Doctor? Feeling
like saving someone?

29:19.525 --> 29:22.226
I prefer no women dying
in this operation.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.997
We need a flat surface.
The kitchen should do.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.767
-Kitchen?
-Yes. Can you get
your men to help me?

29:29.769 --> 29:32.035
Okay. Go.
Yes, sir.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.173
[gunman]
All right, listen up.

29:37.877 --> 29:41.545
The doors are rigged
with explosives.

29:41.547 --> 29:44.081
And don't even try the windows.

29:44.083 --> 29:47.417
Step outside and you're dead.

29:47.419 --> 29:50.120
Do you understand?
Do we have an understanding?

29:50.122 --> 29:53.023
Yeah? Have I made myself clear?

29:53.859 --> 29:54.992
Yeah?

29:55.528 --> 29:56.860
Good.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.502
[Mary] She's been shot.

30:10.543 --> 30:13.811
[breathing raggedly]

30:14.980 --> 30:16.380
What's happened?

30:16.382 --> 30:17.581
You've been shot.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.184
[woman] Oh...

30:20.186 --> 30:21.351
You're bleeding.

30:23.189 --> 30:25.055
Am I going to die?

30:26.091 --> 30:27.991
No.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.927
Not if we can get the bullet.

30:33.165 --> 30:37.601
Knives, alcohol,
sharp scissors,

30:37.603 --> 30:39.269
and lots of towels,
lots and lots of towels.

30:39.271 --> 30:40.504
Yes, of course.

30:44.243 --> 30:45.909
I've done it many times.

30:51.050 --> 30:54.251
You're going to be all right.
I've done this lots of times.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.893
[sighs]

31:02.895 --> 31:05.929
We found Ho-jin by the door,
Eito and Ki-nam out
on the perimeter.

31:05.931 --> 31:09.533
But Ho-jin's weapon is missing
and the police might be
on the way.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.903
[Goro]
We knew we'd have to deal
with them at some point.

31:12.905 --> 31:16.506
But who is he?
Don't know. No idea.

31:16.508 --> 31:19.076
Not on the list.
Last-minute arrival.

31:19.078 --> 31:22.346
I'd like to find out
for whom he works.

31:27.887 --> 31:29.086
Come on.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.508
Sir?

31:51.510 --> 31:53.543
Cop car coming up solo.

32:17.369 --> 32:19.202
[in Italian]

32:32.384 --> 32:35.218
[gunshots]
[officers groaning]

32:36.121 --> 32:38.355
Good evening, officers.

32:41.093 --> 32:42.726
[groans loudly]

32:50.636 --> 32:52.035
Bianchi?

32:52.972 --> 32:54.071
Bianchi?

32:55.274 --> 32:56.707
[captain on radio,
in Italian]

32:58.043 --> 33:01.144
[in Italian]

33:07.586 --> 33:08.685
[Goro in English]
Take him in.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.354
[Bianchi groaning]

33:10.356 --> 33:13.056
Hide the cars.
Maybe more cops are coming.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.087
Yeah?
[Diana] <i> Dad?</i>

33:44.089 --> 33:45.756
[sighs] Are you okay?

33:47.092 --> 33:49.059
<i> Yeah, I found the hotel.</i>

33:50.396 --> 33:51.595
Okay, great.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.732
I love you.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.501
<i> Dad?</i>
Yeah?

33:58.570 --> 34:00.771
<i> Get Mary.</i>
I will.

34:22.828 --> 34:24.194
Here.

34:35.139 --> 34:37.641
[breathing heavily]

34:37.643 --> 34:40.677
[captain] <i> Bianchi?</i>

[in Italian]

35:23.522 --> 35:25.822
[in Italian]

36:11.703 --> 36:13.904
[in English]
You are going to get us killed.

36:16.441 --> 36:20.877
I don't think there's a sniper
allocated to our windows.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.246
A bluff.
Are you sure?

36:24.650 --> 36:25.882
Pretty sure.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.551
I don't like "pretty."

36:29.421 --> 36:31.955
We can't wait for them
to kill us all, can we?

36:31.957 --> 36:34.424
They would have already done it
if they wanted to.

36:35.227 --> 36:36.426
Not sure.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.846
So that's what you came for?

36:56.848 --> 36:58.615
How do I open it?

37:04.623 --> 37:05.956
Sara!

37:05.958 --> 37:07.324
The code!

37:11.897 --> 37:13.730
I don't have it.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.733
How am I to believe this?

37:19.972 --> 37:21.905
One hostage.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.373
What are you doing?

37:23.375 --> 37:24.507
A test.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.880
[screaming]

37:40.259 --> 37:42.259
They're going to kill us
one by one.

37:54.306 --> 37:57.574
[on video: gunshot, screaming]

38:09.721 --> 38:11.588
Do you enjoy killing?

38:12.491 --> 38:13.590
Yes.

38:18.530 --> 38:22.599
We can keep on for quite
a while, but maybe...

38:25.003 --> 38:28.938
Maybe you will be more receptive
if your daughter's life
is at stake.

38:31.777 --> 38:32.976
Ten.

38:33.679 --> 38:34.811
Nine.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.614
Eight.
Dad!

38:37.616 --> 38:41.017
Seven. Six.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.053
Five.
All right!

38:44.556 --> 38:45.922
Stop.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.334
J-D...

38:57.703 --> 38:59.869
W-K...

38:59.871 --> 39:03.840
89-54-A-S.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.478
[lock buzzes, clicks open]

39:08.480 --> 39:11.548
I've been briefed that...

39:13.051 --> 39:15.752
I need three keys
to open the vault.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.420
You had one.

39:17.422 --> 39:21.024
The other two are
in Singapore and in Paris.

39:21.026 --> 39:24.561
But not today.
I don't know who has them.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.964
We have been preparing
for a scenario like this.

39:27.966 --> 39:32.502
I know,
but you do have information

39:32.504 --> 39:37.474
that those scumbags
you call shareholders

39:37.476 --> 39:40.577
may want to trade
for a few coins.

39:42.914 --> 39:47.650
Look. I'll give you 10 million
if you walk away right now.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.053
Ten million?
Yes.

39:51.623 --> 39:54.391
Wait, wait.

39:54.393 --> 39:57.093
There is 150 under our feet.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.497
Untraceable.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.000
Thank you.

40:05.670 --> 40:06.936
No.

40:06.938 --> 40:09.038
No, thanks. Take them off.

40:11.410 --> 40:13.476
I have it. Keep her down.

40:13.478 --> 40:15.845
[both breathing heavily]

40:15.847 --> 40:17.680
Oh, God... That's...

40:17.682 --> 40:19.115
Where's the bullet?

40:20.485 --> 40:21.918
Oh, God.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.621
I got it! I got it.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.790
She's hemorrhaging!

40:26.792 --> 40:29.626
-What?
-Put pressure on the wound.

40:29.628 --> 40:32.829
We've got to take her
to a hospital. Push. Push!

40:33.999 --> 40:36.900
-Please hurry!
-Keep pushing.
Keep pushing really hard.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.070
Shit.

40:42.174 --> 40:43.706
Sophia...

41:04.863 --> 41:08.865
It's gonna take a while
without the other two keys.

41:08.867 --> 41:12.001
Every single guest went
through the metal detector.

41:14.739 --> 41:17.941
Wait. Zoom in on it.

41:19.211 --> 41:21.778
I got it. It's not metal.

41:23.715 --> 41:28.651
I will strip naked
every single hostage
if I have to.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.053
[chuckles]

41:30.055 --> 41:32.589
You always manage to get
all the fun for yourself.

41:33.592 --> 41:36.826
Janko, the keys are not metal.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.962
Check the hostages again.

42:02.053 --> 42:04.521
I know what they want
and how to find them.

42:05.056 --> 42:06.222
Where's Mary?

42:07.792 --> 42:09.659
I have to find her first.

42:10.529 --> 42:12.262
We have to join forces.

42:12.264 --> 42:14.564
We'll go find her.
Okay. Let's go.

42:24.209 --> 42:25.642
[automatic gunfire]

43:23.735 --> 43:25.134
Drop the weapon.

43:29.140 --> 43:31.240
Who the fuck are you?

43:48.760 --> 43:49.993
[Sara] Freeze!

44:02.273 --> 44:04.073
It's my time, Dad.

44:07.045 --> 44:08.378
Why?

44:08.380 --> 44:10.246
[Sara]
You sell Rossini Enterprises

44:10.248 --> 44:13.983
as a great, conscious,
people-loving company.

44:13.985 --> 44:17.387
But I know what you did
in the Congo, Liberia, and Iran.

44:17.389 --> 44:21.324
I know about the illegal
financing and the child soldiers
occupying the mines.

44:23.128 --> 44:24.994
I know about the fields
in Afghanistan.

44:27.032 --> 44:30.333
It is what paid for everything
you've ever had.

44:32.070 --> 44:33.836
-[gunshot]
-[Rossini grunts]

44:36.207 --> 44:37.373
Take them away.

44:43.715 --> 44:44.947
Thank you.

44:45.784 --> 44:47.150
You'll be rich.

44:48.353 --> 44:49.986
And I will be in power.

44:52.090 --> 44:53.389
Maybe.

44:58.396 --> 45:00.363
Excessive baggage.

45:08.039 --> 45:09.338
[in Italian]

45:37.402 --> 45:39.268
[shouts]

45:44.109 --> 45:45.775
[in English]
What's the situation?

45:45.777 --> 45:47.977
Approximately
15 to 20 commandos.

45:47.979 --> 45:51.914
Apparently,
Rossini has a treasure
buried underneath the villa.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.750
How did they secure
the area?

45:53.752 --> 45:56.119
Explosives all around
and sniper on the roof.

45:56.888 --> 45:58.054
Easy.

46:00.258 --> 46:02.492
But efficient. We shouldn't
underestimate these guys.

46:02.494 --> 46:03.826
Mary?

46:17.509 --> 46:18.508
Hey!

46:31.122 --> 46:33.189
Just wanted to cut a tampon.

46:34.159 --> 46:35.324
Cooper, knife?

46:37.195 --> 46:39.796
-What are you doing
with a half tampon?
-[Mary] Cooper.

46:39.798 --> 46:43.132
This thing
was actually developed
in World War I

46:43.134 --> 46:46.235
by a French surgeon
for bullet wounds.

46:47.172 --> 46:50.473
Only later, they realized...

46:50.475 --> 46:52.408
Well, you get the idea.

46:53.978 --> 46:55.344
Cooper, check the wound.

46:57.482 --> 46:58.815
[Cooper]
Still bleeding.

47:00.151 --> 47:02.885
Okay.
[knife sawing]

47:02.887 --> 47:04.420
Hold her, okay?
She may wake up.

47:12.330 --> 47:13.963
-Hold her still. Hold her down.
-[Sophia groans, gasps]

47:13.965 --> 47:15.331
Hold her down. Hold her down!

47:15.333 --> 47:17.366
Hold her... down.

47:17.368 --> 47:18.901
[gasps]

47:23.274 --> 47:24.407
How long?

47:25.610 --> 47:26.976
Without the keys?

47:28.213 --> 47:29.312
An hour.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.050
[Mary] All right.

47:34.052 --> 47:36.953
Just keep a light pressure
on the wound, okay?

47:36.955 --> 47:38.187
Okay.

47:41.259 --> 47:42.859
Thank you.

47:43.228 --> 47:44.427
Yeah.

Two armed men walking
out of the main entrance.

49:24.028 --> 49:25.528
They're not in the main hall.

49:28.266 --> 49:31.067
They're upstairs.

49:31.069 --> 49:33.436
It looks like they've been
separated in different rooms.

49:37.709 --> 49:40.142
I've got visual on the sniper.

49:40.144 --> 49:41.677
He oversees the whole perimeter.

49:41.679 --> 49:44.213
I'll have to take him out
before you can go in.

49:59.364 --> 50:01.030
Good luck.

50:12.710 --> 50:14.410
Did you find the keys?

50:50.748 --> 50:52.248
I've got visual on the sniper.

51:01.759 --> 51:03.059

Proceed.

In position.

Looks pretty good.

52:30.515 --> 52:31.714
Pretty good.

52:32.583 --> 52:33.749
We have to jump.

We'll call for help.

Good evening, gentlemen.

if I were you.

58:35.212 --> 58:36.778

58:38.282 --> 58:41.550

I'm ready for a deal, Captain.

-What kind of deal?
-I'm going to free
all the hostages.

58:45.289 --> 58:48.023
-What do we have to do?
-Nothing.

58:48.025 --> 58:50.626
I've concluded my business
with Mr. Rossini,

58:50.628 --> 58:53.028
and it's time for us to leave.

and once they are loaded,
we'll be gone.

58:59.270 --> 59:01.003
No tricks.

59:02.172 --> 59:04.206
Free five now.

59:04.208 --> 59:08.043
-For good faith.
-That will not be necessary.

59:08.045 --> 59:13.815
I'll execute five hostages
every time you try
to break our deal.

59:21.892 --> 59:23.125
Just think about it.

59:25.262 --> 59:27.996
If everything goes right,

59:27.998 --> 59:30.899
you'll be known as the man
who single-handedly managed

59:30.901 --> 59:34.570
the worst hostage crisis
on Italian soil since...

59:35.839 --> 59:37.673
I'm not sure since when.

59:39.843 --> 59:40.909
[scoffs]

59:48.686 --> 59:49.952
[in Italian]

01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:07.002
-[Emma exclaims]
-[straining]

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:48.744
-[Mary sighs]
-[Goro in English]
Did you save her?

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:55.283
A casualty of war.

01:00:57.888 --> 01:00:59.421
[Mary] What war?

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:01.356
[Goro]
Redistribution of wealth.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.428
Stealing?
You don't strike me
as a Robin Hood.

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:09.831
No time to explain.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.366
[Cooper shouts]

01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:15.971
[groans]

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:20.075
You come with me.

01:02:13.797 --> 01:02:15.030
Get it out.

01:02:30.781 --> 01:02:33.915
[beeping]

01:02:51.502 --> 01:02:53.135
Shit.

01:02:58.909 --> 01:03:00.075
[snaps fingers]

01:03:06.784 --> 01:03:09.417
[beeping continues]

01:03:10.988 --> 01:03:11.987
Okay.

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:21.296
Okay, listen.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.431
You're all gonna
be free very soon.

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:26.802
Buses are on their way,
but we're gonna need
to tie your hands

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:28.537
and put hoods over your heads

01:03:28.539 --> 01:03:31.206
for this exchange
to go smooth, yeah?

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:33.208
So don't be alarmed.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:36.545
Cooperate and everything
will run smooth.

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:38.346
Understand?

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:10.445
[Goro] Behave.
[Mary] Get your hands off me!

01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:27.295
[phone vibrates]

01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:28.930
Visual on Mary.

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:30.031
Where?

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.600
The underground site.

01:04:31.602 --> 01:04:33.301
<i> They're going down.</i>

01:04:33.303 --> 01:04:35.937
Let's go.

01:04:35.939 --> 01:04:37.906
[beeping continues]

01:04:58.128 --> 01:04:59.327
Come on.

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:04.566
Good girl. Good girl!

01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:13.441
[muttering]

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:19.147
[beeping stops]

01:05:19.149 --> 01:05:20.482
[Emma sighs]

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:37.065
[beeps]

01:05:42.506 --> 01:05:43.705
You'd better run.

01:05:50.047 --> 01:05:51.479
[phone vibrates]

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:55.350
Psst. Wait.

01:06:46.136 --> 01:06:48.336
Shh. Anybody hurt?

01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:52.340
Okay, you're safe now.

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.743
I'm gonna check the others.
Stay quiet.

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:30.178
What's going on?

01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:38.153
[wet gagging]

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:49.531
[gasping]

01:08:13.523 --> 01:08:15.156
[muffled gunshot]

01:08:21.865 --> 01:08:23.298
[grunts]

01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:25.633
[gagging]

01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:41.616
Okay. So, you can
just leave me here.

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:43.551
[laughs] No. No way.

01:08:45.255 --> 01:08:48.156
-You don't need me.
-You'd be dead by now
if I didn't.

01:08:49.526 --> 01:08:51.426
But I know who you are.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:57.499
You're the wife,
therefore I do need you.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:03.505
Go get Mary.

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:05.140
Okay. Got it.

01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:19.453
[automatic gunfire]

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:38.273
[panting]

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:33.895
[grunts]

01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:36.698
[breathing heavily]

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:13.468
Let's go.

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:26.881
[officers speaking Italian]

01:11:32.322 --> 01:11:34.756
[in Italian]

01:11:45.335 --> 01:11:48.770
[in English]
Go ahead, now. Go, go...

01:11:54.577 --> 01:11:55.877
[Sara]
Tell him I'm sorry.

01:11:58.381 --> 01:11:59.514
My father.

01:11:59.516 --> 01:12:01.916
Okay. Let me help you.

01:12:01.918 --> 01:12:02.917
I'm sorry.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.653
No, no! Stay with me!

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:25.340
Frank, what happened?

01:12:25.775 --> 01:12:27.575
I'm okay.

01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:29.010
Shit.
Just got a bad headache.

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:30.445
But I'm good.

01:12:30.447 --> 01:12:31.512
Okay.

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:34.382
Yes?

01:12:36.419 --> 01:12:37.752
Copy that.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:39.854
Go.

01:12:40.824 --> 01:12:42.123
Go!

01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:49.664
You navigate.

01:12:53.002 --> 01:12:56.003
[Rossini groaning]

01:13:04.748 --> 01:13:05.980
I'm with you.

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:11.619
Where are they?

01:13:12.822 --> 01:13:14.722
Most of them dead.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:17.158
It's over. Let's go outside.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:19.927
Sara?

01:13:29.139 --> 01:13:30.705
She said she forgave you.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:42.450
[sobbing]

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.434
What the fuck?

01:13:59.436 --> 01:14:02.603
You son of a bitch!
What's going on?

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:05.807
Phone Tracker. App on.

01:14:05.809 --> 01:14:08.176
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

01:14:08.178 --> 01:14:10.144
You dumb fucking bitch!

01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:13.080
I knew you were a bitch.

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:16.083
[hisses]

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:24.559
Turn the lights off.

01:14:35.772 --> 01:14:39.140
Left, left.
Fifty meters hard left,
90 degrees.

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:45.046
Then 100 meters straight,
slight right at the fork.

01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:48.916
Stop here.

01:14:54.691 --> 01:14:57.825
[Emma]
Hundred meters straight,
slight right at the fork.

01:14:59.963 --> 01:15:02.029
This road leads right
to the red spot.

01:15:17.814 --> 01:15:19.747
Come! Come on!

01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:21.582
Come on, baby!

01:15:21.584 --> 01:15:23.084
-[Mary] Let go! Let go of me!
-Get over here.

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:32.159
You son of a bitch!
Fuck you!

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:50.244
Here. Come on.

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:58.786
Not another step. Not one!

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:02.657
Let her go.

01:16:02.659 --> 01:16:04.926
Not just yet!

01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:08.262
I don't care about the gold.
Just let her go.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.300
Don't come closer!

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:16.103
Bring me your car.

01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:19.206
I'll drive down the hill
and leave her there.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:27.214
Deal.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:42.096
[Goro] Come on.

01:16:46.002 --> 01:16:48.636
[groaning]

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:05.286
[groaning, panting]

01:17:18.034 --> 01:17:19.333
Here you are.

01:17:21.204 --> 01:17:22.637
Come closer.

01:17:28.111 --> 01:17:30.311
Take the bags
and put them in your car.

01:17:36.052 --> 01:17:37.184
[Michael] Okay.

01:17:49.766 --> 01:17:50.898
[beeps]

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:04.945
[Goro] Come here.

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:19.093
Thank you.

01:18:21.831 --> 01:18:24.265
And now... this is yours!

01:18:46.355 --> 01:18:48.055
Oh, God.

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:50.891
[both breathing heavily]

01:18:51.728 --> 01:18:52.993
He got away with it.

01:18:55.264 --> 01:18:56.464
Do you think so?

01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:10.344
A couple of stitches
will do.

01:19:10.346 --> 01:19:12.980
I think it will be
more than a couple.

01:19:12.982 --> 01:19:14.782
But I'm glad you made it.
So am I.

01:19:14.784 --> 01:19:17.418
I don't like
talking business at a party.
And what a party.

01:19:19.822 --> 01:19:21.489
Hey.

01:19:21.491 --> 01:19:24.158
Frank, how you doing?
Michael.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.860
Glad to see you're okay.

01:19:25.862 --> 01:19:26.994
So am I.

01:19:28.164 --> 01:19:29.530
[sighs]

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:42.409
Dad?

01:19:51.254 --> 01:19:52.920
Okay, okay.

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:56.924
You're okay.
[Diana]
I was so scared.

01:20:03.232 --> 01:20:04.865
It's okay.

01:20:05.935 --> 01:20:07.434
It's okay.
Everything's good.

01:20:35.464 --> 01:20:38.465
[singing]

01:20:48.411 --> 01:20:51.245
[singing continues]

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:11.198
[laughing]

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:25.412
[beeping]
