00:23.880 --> 00:26.515
WE'VE NEVER MET.
IN FACT, I'M NOT EVEN SURE YOU EXIST.

00:26.517 --> 00:28.384
SO WHY AM I TALKING TO YOU?
MAYBE YOU'RE HOT.

00:28.386 --> 00:30.552
MAYBE I'M TRYING TO GROW
MY INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS.

00:30.554 --> 00:32.521
MAYBE I JUST NEED VALIDATION
THAT I'M A GOOD GUY,

00:32.523 --> 00:34.589
AND THAT MY SOULMATE
IS STILL OUT THERE.

00:34.591 --> 00:37.259
WHATEVER THE REASON, JUST HOLD
OFF ON YOUR JUDGMENT TILL THE END.

00:37.261 --> 00:38.460
WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE I'LL BLOW YOUR MIND.

00:38.462 --> 00:40.061
SO WHERE DO I START?

00:40.063 --> 00:42.363
UM, I WISH I COULD SAY
IT BEGAN WITH A SWIPE,

00:42.365 --> 00:44.232
BUT IF I'M BEING REAL,
IT BEGAN

00:44.234 --> 00:46.067
WHEN I SAW "EDWARD SCISSORHANDS"
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

00:46.069 --> 00:48.537
SOMETHING ABOUT WINONA RYDER
AND JOHNNY DEPP

00:48.539 --> 00:52.374
JUST ROLE-PLAYING TIM BURTON'S
WET DREAM REALLY SPOKE TO ME.

00:52.376 --> 00:54.210
I BEEN CHASING
THAT ROMANCE EVER SINCE.

00:54.212 --> 00:56.110
HONESTLY, IT'S EXHAUSTING.
SO WHY EVEN TRY?

00:56.112 --> 00:58.347
WELL, DESPITE THE FACT
THAT MY CYNICISM GROWS

00:58.349 --> 01:00.915
LIKE TENSIONS WITH NORTH KOREA,

01:00.917 --> 01:03.118
HOPE... HOPE THAT MY PERSON
IS STILL OUT THERE.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.120
DON'T LOSE HOPE JUST
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALMOST 30

01:05.122 --> 01:07.590
AND YOU HAVEN'T MET SOMEONE YOU
FEEL COMFORTABLE FARTING AROUND.

01:25.408 --> 01:29.313
♪ I DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE IT,
OH... ♪

01:31.249 --> 01:33.414
PARDON ME, SIR.

01:33.416 --> 01:38.953
ARE YOU THE HANDSOME GENTLEMAN I
CAME UPON IN MY CELLULAR DEVICE?

01:38.955 --> 01:41.923
YOU ARE SO GOOD-LOOKING,
I JUST HAD TO TALK TO YOU.

01:41.925 --> 01:43.926
I AIN'T NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE,

01:43.928 --> 01:47.061
SO COULD WE TAKE IT REAL SLOW...

01:47.063 --> 01:51.900
OKAY... JUST BE A NORMAL HUMAN
FOR FIVE SECONDS.

01:51.902 --> 01:53.903
OKAY.

01:55.339 --> 01:58.641
HI. UM, THIS IS EMMA WARREN,

01:58.643 --> 02:01.242
AND IT IS FRIDAY, UH,
DECEMBER 3RD

02:01.244 --> 02:03.411
AT APPROXIMATELY 4:00 PM.

02:03.413 --> 02:06.581
IF I GET RAPED
AND SERIAL KILLED,

02:06.583 --> 02:08.583
IT WAS PROBABLY
WILLIAM FROM TINDER,

02:08.585 --> 02:11.654
WHOSE LAST NAME IS...
I DON'T KNOW,

02:11.656 --> 02:14.656
UM, BUT YOU CAN FIND IT
IN MY PHONE UNDER...

02:14.658 --> 02:17.294
HE... HEY!

02:19.430 --> 02:22.064
HEY!

02:22.066 --> 02:23.332
ARE YOU WRITING ME A TICKET?

02:23.334 --> 02:24.533
YOUR METER'S EXPIRED.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.235
I WAS SITTING IN THE CAR.

02:26.237 --> 02:27.602
YEAH, I SEE YOU IN THERE
PUTTING ON MAKEUP,

02:27.604 --> 02:28.906
BUT THIS ISN'T A GREEN ROOM.

02:32.043 --> 02:34.343
ARE YOU SERIOUS, $68?

02:34.345 --> 02:35.678
- HAVE A GOOD DAY, MISS.
- NO.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.379
THIS... THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

02:37.381 --> 02:39.180
- WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
- MY NAME'S ON THE TICKET.

02:39.182 --> 02:40.548
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

02:40.550 --> 02:42.150
YOU NEED TO FILL
YOUR LITTLE QUOTA OR WHATEVER,

02:42.152 --> 02:43.652
BUT THIS IS INSANE.
THIS IS SO BACKWARDS.

02:43.654 --> 02:45.487
IT'S ACTUALLY
VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

02:45.489 --> 02:48.190
GOD, WHY DOES EVERY METER MAID
HAVE TO BE SUCH AN ASSHOLE?

02:48.192 --> 02:50.124
YOU KNOW, I'D LEAVE
MY JOB OUT OF THIS,

02:50.126 --> 02:53.295
AND YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S NOT
BEING VERY NICE RIGHT NOW.

02:53.297 --> 02:54.730
ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT THIS?

02:54.732 --> 02:56.598
HOW'S THAT FOR NICE?

02:56.600 --> 02:58.232
BOOM. YEAH.

02:58.234 --> 02:59.635
THIS DOESN'T EVEN NEED MONEY,
MA'AM.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.070
I COULD DO THIS ALL DAY.

03:01.072 --> 03:03.539
NOT NICE, HE SAYS.
I'M SO NICE.

03:03.541 --> 03:05.239
WELL, MAYBE IF YOU PUT SOME
MONEY IN YOUR METER

03:05.241 --> 03:06.575
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GOT A TICKET.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.010
LISTEN, IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU'RE IN THE CAR,

03:08.012 --> 03:09.577
ON THE CAR,
LISTENING TO THE CAR,

03:09.579 --> 03:10.612
PUTTING MAKEUP ON THE CAR,

03:10.614 --> 03:12.348
OR PUTTING MAKEUP ON YOU,

03:12.350 --> 03:13.715
YOU GOTTA PUT MONEY
IN THE METER.

03:13.717 --> 03:16.084

03:36.206 --> 03:39.107
SORRY, I WAS BUSY, UH,
FIGHTING THE MAN.

03:39.109 --> 03:43.011
SO, I THOUGHT THIS PLACE
WAS A CAFÉ.

03:43.013 --> 03:44.679
OH, YEAH, IT'S CAFÉ STYLE,

03:44.681 --> 03:46.280
SO YOU CAN ORDER FOOD
AT THE BAR.

03:46.282 --> 03:48.450
YOU KNOW,
THEY'LL SERVE IT TO YOU.

03:48.452 --> 03:50.052
HEY, COULD I GET ANOTHER ONE?

03:50.054 --> 03:54.089
SO, UH, WHAT DO YA...
WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE?

03:54.091 --> 03:56.424
LIKE FROM THIS DATE OR...?

03:56.426 --> 03:58.594

YEAH, OR DRINKS.

04:00.197 --> 04:03.098
OH, CAN I HAVE A FOOD MENU,
PLEASE?

04:03.100 --> 04:05.036
THANK YOU.

04:07.170 --> 04:08.536
YOU LOOK GOOD.

04:08.538 --> 04:10.638
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.242
I WAS WORRIED 'CAUSE YOUR FACE IS
BLOCKED IN MOST OF YOUR PHOTOS.

04:13.244 --> 04:14.676
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

04:14.678 --> 04:16.744
THEY'RE ALL IN, LIKE,
SUPER DARK SETTINGS

04:16.745 --> 04:18.512
OR FROM REALLY FAR AWAY,

04:18.515 --> 04:21.815
SO IT'S KINDA TOUGH TO, LIKE,
MAKE OUT YOUR FACE.

04:21.817 --> 04:23.451
MM.

04:23.453 --> 04:24.752
WHY DID YOU SWIPE THEN?

04:24.754 --> 04:27.155
- 'CAUSE I SWIPE ON EVERYONE.
- OH.

04:27.157 --> 04:29.357
YEAH, JUST 'CAUSE YOU MATCH DOESN'T
MEAN YOU HAVE TO CONVERSATE.

04:29.359 --> 04:31.693
OKAY. THEN WHY ARE WE
CONVERSING?

04:33.364 --> 04:35.631
YOU SEEM FUN.

04:35.633 --> 04:37.165

MY ROOMMATE WOULD LOVE YOU.

04:37.167 --> 04:38.499

04:38.501 --> 04:41.804
I GET A VERY POLYAMOROUS VIBE

04:41.806 --> 04:44.239
LIKE A MORMON?

04:44.241 --> 04:45.674
WHAT'S THAT?

04:45.676 --> 04:47.408
OH, IT'S BLUE CURACAO.

04:47.410 --> 04:48.610
ISN'T THAT A LIQUEUR?

04:48.612 --> 04:51.080
YEAH, I ONLY DRINK LIQUOR.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.547
EXCUSE ME.

04:52.549 --> 04:55.684

THE ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS,

04:59.090 --> 05:01.122

05:01.124 --> 05:03.725
SASHA.

05:06.429 --> 05:11.266
SO, UM, WHAT WAS THE LAST THING
YOU WERE IN?

05:11.268 --> 05:12.600
YOU MEAN LIKE ON TINDER?

05:12.602 --> 05:16.105
NO, I MEAN LIKE A TV SHOW
OR SOMETHING.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.372
I DELIVER WEED.

05:17.374 --> 05:19.307
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE AN ACTOR.

05:19.309 --> 05:21.110
OH! SOMETIMES.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.145
- MOSTLY I DELIVER WEED.
- OH.

05:23.147 --> 05:25.480
BUSINESS MUST BE BOOMING.

05:25.482 --> 05:28.386
WHAT? IT TAKES LONGER
TO MICROWAVE LEFTOVERS.

05:32.155 --> 05:35.590
WHAT IS, UH, THE MOST ADVENTUROUS
THING YOU'VE EVER DONE?

05:35.592 --> 05:37.359
- WHAT?
- TELL ME, LIKE,

05:37.361 --> 05:39.561
WHAT THE MOST ADVENTUROUS THING
IS YOU'VE EVER DONE.

05:39.563 --> 05:43.564
OH, GOD, UH, MY FRIENDS INVITED
ME SKYDIVING ONCE,

05:43.566 --> 05:45.400
BUT I CHICKENED OUT.

05:45.402 --> 05:47.369
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- WHAT?

05:47.371 --> 05:48.603
DEB. HEY, HEY.

05:48.605 --> 05:50.405
UM, OH!

05:50.407 --> 05:52.407
- YEAH, LET'S HUG.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:52.409 --> 05:54.408
- YOU SMELL DELIGHTFUL.
- OH!

05:54.410 --> 05:56.410
- THANK YOU.
- UH, YEAH, CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?

05:56.412 --> 05:58.446
YOU SEEM LIKE AN APEROL SPRITZ
KINDA GAL.

05:58.448 --> 05:59.614
- OH, YEAH?
- YEAH.

05:59.616 --> 06:01.449
OKAY. HOW REFRESHING.

06:01.451 --> 06:04.585
IT AMAZES ME HOW FEW PEOPLE
WILL EVEN ENTERTAIN THE IDEA.

06:04.587 --> 06:07.355
I MEAN, WHEN AN OPEN
RELATIONSHIP FALLS APART,

06:07.357 --> 06:10.191
- EVERYONE'S QUICK TO BLAME THE OPEN RELATIONSHIP.
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

06:10.193 --> 06:12.194
BUT WHEN A COMPLETELY MONOGAMOUS
RELATIONSHIP FALLS APART,

06:12.196 --> 06:13.694
NOBODY EVEN THINKS
TO BLAME THE MONOGAMY.

06:13.696 --> 06:15.230
YEAH, THAT'S
A REALLY GOOD POINT.

06:15.232 --> 06:16.465
IF A RELATIONSHIP'S GONNA
FALL APART

06:16.467 --> 06:17.566
IT'S BECAUSE
OF THE PEOPLE IN IT,

06:17.568 --> 06:19.167
NOT THE CLASSIFICATION.

06:19.169 --> 06:21.403
BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR,
YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

06:21.405 --> 06:23.739
YEAH. HE'S A SMALL DOG TRAINER.

06:23.741 --> 06:26.475
YOUR BOYFRIEND IS SMALL
OR HE TRAINS SMALL DOGS?

06:26.477 --> 06:27.675
BOTH.

06:27.677 --> 06:29.845
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

06:29.847 --> 06:33.182
UH, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST LOOKING
TO CONNECT WITH SOMEBODY.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.650
THE APPS ARE GREAT FOR THAT,

06:34.652 --> 06:36.417
BUT UNLESS YOUR EQUATION
ADDS UP PERFECTLY...

06:36.419 --> 06:38.287
YOUR JOB PLUS YOUR HEIGHT
DIVIDED BY DISTANCE...

06:38.289 --> 06:40.222
THEN IT'S JUST AN INSTANT SWIPE
TO THE NEXT.

06:40.224 --> 06:42.256
- YOU THINK THAT'S HOW GIRLS USE TINDER?
- WHAT?

06:42.258 --> 06:43.824
THAT MOSTLY ONLY GIRLS CARE
ABOUT HEIGHT?

06:43.826 --> 06:46.261
I MEAN, YEAH, I GUESS.

06:46.263 --> 06:47.795
WHAT'S YOUR PERFECT
EQUATION THEN?

06:47.797 --> 06:50.198
I JUST KNOW THAT I WANNA MEET
SOMEBODY THAT I LIKE.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.799
YOU KNOW? EVER SINCE
I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL

06:51.801 --> 06:53.401
I'VE JUST WANTED TO BE
IN A RELATIONSHIP,

06:53.403 --> 06:56.405
BUT, UH, THE TYPE OF PERSON
I'M LOOKING FOR?

06:56.407 --> 06:58.773
- HOPEFULLY I'M JUST TAKEN BY SURPRISE.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

06:58.775 --> 07:00.475
WELL, IT'S LIKE RUINING
THE END OF A MOVIE.

07:00.477 --> 07:01.977
YOU KNOW?

07:01.979 --> 07:03.645
IF YOU ALREADY KNOW
WHAT TYPE OF PERSON YOU WANT,

07:03.647 --> 07:05.446
THEN IT'S NOT MUCH OF A SURPRISE
WHEN YOU GET IT.

07:05.448 --> 07:07.415
- GET WHAT?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK I WANT?

07:07.417 --> 07:09.251
A HAPPY ENDING.

07:09.253 --> 07:10.485
NOT... NOT LIKE A...

07:10.487 --> 07:13.254
HAPPY ENDING, BUT...

07:13.256 --> 07:15.290
HAPPY ENDING LIKE IN...
IN A MOVIE.

07:15.292 --> 07:17.359
JUST DON'T SAY "GET IT."
YOU SOUND POSSESSIVE.

07:17.361 --> 07:19.927
SO, IS THIS WHERE YOU
TAKE ALL YOUR TINDER DATES?

07:19.929 --> 07:22.631
NO, SOMETIMES WE SIT OVER THERE.

07:22.633 --> 07:24.799
WELL, I DON'T LIKE THIS PLACE.

07:24.801 --> 07:26.934
OH, WE CAN GO TO THE BAR
DOWN THE ROAD.

07:26.936 --> 07:28.569
IT'S FRENCH THEMED.

07:28.571 --> 07:30.439
- ARE YOU DRIVING?
- YEAH, SURE.

07:30.441 --> 07:32.273
I... I VALETED,
I CAN... YEAH.

07:32.275 --> 07:34.009
- CAN I SEE YOUR ID?
- WHAT?

07:34.011 --> 07:36.410
I'M GETTING INTO A STRANGER'S CAR,
I NEED TO TAKE A PICTURE OF YOUR ID,

07:36.412 --> 07:38.013
AND TEXT IT TO A FRIEND
JUST IN CASE.

07:38.015 --> 07:40.919
IN CASE I KILL YOU?

07:53.530 --> 07:55.530
- HEY.
- I HAD THE WAITRESS GET ANOTHER ROUND.

07:55.532 --> 07:57.799
- OH, NICE.
- MM-HMM.

07:57.801 --> 07:59.701
- IT'S A REALLY COOL PLACE.
- YEAH.

07:59.703 --> 08:01.302
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

08:01.304 --> 08:04.306
THESE, UM, THESE WALLS ARE
ACTUALLY IMPORTED

08:04.308 --> 08:06.775
FROM THE FRENCH QUARTER.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.643
- OH. YEAH.
- NEW ORLEANS. IT'S IN NEW ORLEANS.

08:08.645 --> 08:10.879
I DIG IT.
IT'S LIKE WE'RE OUTSIDE,

08:10.881 --> 08:12.413
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY INSIDE.

08:12.415 --> 08:14.415
I HAVE A SUITE AT THE CHATEAU
RIGHT NOW.

08:14.417 --> 08:16.518
SMOOTH TRANSITION.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.388
WELL, ACTUALLY IT'S A DOWNGRADE.

08:19.390 --> 08:22.323
I, UH, I WAS AT THE MONDRIAN
LAST NIGHT, BUT...

08:22.325 --> 08:23.792
YEAH. SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU DO?

08:23.794 --> 08:26.328

08:26.330 --> 08:28.330
NO. NO.

FOR LIKE A MINNIE,

08:54.858 --> 08:57.726

AND IT ENDED WITH SALMA HAYEK
THROWING A SHOE AT ME.

09:26.523 --> 09:30.992
SO, MY EX KNOWS SALMA.

09:30.994 --> 09:33.761
THEY KNOW EACH OTHER.
YEAH, TALK ABOUT HER ALL THE TIME.

09:33.763 --> 09:35.764
SHE SAYS, "SELMA HAYEK..."

09:35.766 --> 09:37.565
- YEAH? THAT'S COOL.
- YEAH.

09:37.567 --> 09:38.766
- YEAH. YEAH.
- FOR HER.

09:38.768 --> 09:40.468
UM, SHE'S GREAT.

09:40.470 --> 09:44.473
I JUST MEAN, UM... I WAS SAYING
THAT I SHOW UP TO THIS...

09:44.475 --> 09:46.907
THIS BEHIND-THE-SCENES SHOOT
AND THE HOST HANDS ME HIS PHONE

09:46.909 --> 09:49.678
TO GET SOME INSTAGRAM PICTURES...
WHICH, I MEAN, I GET IT.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.979
IT'S LIKE FRIDA IN THE FLESH,
YOU KNOW.

09:51.981 --> 09:56.684
UM, BUT ANYWAY, SALMA'S TALKING
ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE,

09:56.686 --> 09:58.786
AND I KID YOU NOT,
HIS PHONE GOES OFF

09:58.788 --> 10:01.122
WITH NIRVANA'S "RAPE ME"
AS THE RINGTONE.

10:01.124 --> 10:03.157
IT WAS SO EMBARRASSING.

10:03.159 --> 10:07.929
I WANTED TO CRAWL
INTO A CORNER AND DIE.

10:07.931 --> 10:09.731
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

10:09.733 --> 10:11.098
THANKS.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.470
I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU
TO GET TO KNOW ME.

10:15.071 --> 10:17.139
I MEAN, I THOUGHT I WAS DOING
THE NICE THING,

10:17.141 --> 10:19.841
BUT TO HER I WAS LIKE THE MOST
DISRESPECTFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD.

10:19.843 --> 10:21.843
NICE BUILDING, BY THE WAY.
NICE FOUNTAIN.

10:21.845 --> 10:23.844
I HAD FUN TONIGHT.

10:23.846 --> 10:25.847
YEAH? I... I DID, TOO.

10:25.849 --> 10:28.416
YEAH. MAYBE NEXT TIME
WE CAN DO SOMETHING

10:28.418 --> 10:30.419
THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE ALCOHOL.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.123
- SOUNDS FANTASTIC.
- YEAH.

10:33.990 --> 10:36.024
GOOD NIGHT, LAUREN.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.929
ADAM.

10:45.835 --> 10:48.670
ON THE SURFACE IT LOOKS LIKE JUST
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE SLEEPING AROUND,

10:48.672 --> 10:50.539
BUT OUR LOVE IS JUST
AS LEGITIMATE

10:50.541 --> 10:51.973
AS A MONOGAMOUS RELATIONSHIP.

10:51.975 --> 10:54.074
IF ANYTHING, WE JUST HAVE
TO COMMUNICATE MORE.

10:54.076 --> 10:56.077
OH, DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE A FAN OF POLYAMORY

10:56.079 --> 10:58.646
BECAUSE IT IMPROVES
COMMUNICATION SKILLS.

10:58.648 --> 11:01.449
NO, IT'S JUST ONE OF THE MANY
CHERRIES ON TOP OF A FLAVOR

11:01.451 --> 11:02.983
I SUGGEST EVERYONE TRY.

11:02.985 --> 11:04.886
BUT YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING
JUST ONE FLAVOR.

11:04.888 --> 11:07.689
YOU'RE LOOKING TO DIP YOUR SPOON
INTO A BUNCH OF LITTLE CARTONS

11:07.691 --> 11:09.958
- AND HAVE A TASTE.
- THAT DOES SOUND DELICIOUS.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.525
WELL, DOESN'T MEAN
YOU ALL OF A SUDDEN KNOW

11:11.527 --> 11:15.130
WHAT GOES INTO MAKING ICE CREAM.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.765
AS ABE ROSEN SAID,

11:16.767 --> 11:19.166
YOU'RE JUST A FAN OF THE TERM
"POLYAMORY,"

11:19.168 --> 11:21.602
BECAUSE IT'S LESS JUDGMENTAL
THAN "SLUT."

11:21.604 --> 11:23.838
- WHO THE HELL IS ABE ROSEN?
- I TAKE IT YOU DON'T READ YOUR COMMENTS.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.507
OH, AN INTERNET TROLL?

11:26.509 --> 11:29.777
LOOK, YOU CAN JUDGE ME ALL
YOU WANT FOR USING TINDER

11:29.779 --> 11:31.545
OR BUMBLE OR ANY OF THE APPS

11:31.547 --> 11:33.548
THAT ACTUALLY MAKE DATING FUN
FOR A CHANGE.

11:33.550 --> 11:35.617
BUT IT'S 2018, BABY!

11:35.619 --> 11:38.553
I'M NOT ASHAMED OF CALLING
MYSELF AN EMPOWERED SLUT.

11:38.555 --> 11:40.889
WHAT'S EMPOWERING ABOUT NOT BEING
ABLE TO COMMIT TO ONE PERSON?

11:40.891 --> 11:43.958
SURE, MONOGAMY MIGHT BE
CHALLENGING AT TIMES,

11:43.960 --> 11:45.926
BUT IT'S ALSO MORE REWARDING.

11:45.928 --> 11:47.929
SORRY. WORK.

11:47.931 --> 11:50.265
AH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
IT'S MY MONO MATE, EMMA.

11:50.267 --> 11:53.168
COMING HOME
FROM ANOTHER TINDER ADVENTURE.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.069
EMMA, TELL US,
HOW DID IT GO?

11:57.106 --> 11:58.740
FOR THOSE OF YOU AT HOME
WHO CANNOT SEE,

11:58.742 --> 12:01.575
SHE JUST MIMED BLOWING
HER BRAINS OUT.

12:01.577 --> 12:04.679
EMMA, DOES THAT MEAN
IT WAS EXPLOSIVE?

12:04.681 --> 12:06.647
- NO.
- MM, NOW SHE'S ROLLING HER EYES AT ME AS IF TO SAY,

12:06.649 --> 12:09.851
"CHARLOTTE, I, TOO, DISAPPROVE
OF YOUR LIFESTYLE.

12:09.853 --> 12:12.286
MM, MORE LIKE THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I GET A ROOMMATE ON CRAIGSLIST.

12:12.288 --> 12:15.022
- LOVE YOU, GIRL.
- LOVE YOU.

12:15.024 --> 12:17.758
- SERIOUSLY, HOW'D IT GO?
- NO, I DON'T WANNA INTERRUPT. I HAVE TO LEAVE AGAIN ANYWAY.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.794
NO, NO, NO, NO, STAY.
YOU TWO WOULD HAVE A BLAST.

12:19.796 --> 12:22.097
IT'D BE LIKE
THE MAVENS OF MONOGAMY

12:22.099 --> 12:23.832
VERSUS THE POLY
HOUSE OF PLEASURE.

12:23.834 --> 12:25.132
NO, SOMEONE'S COMPLAINING
ABOUT A LEAK.

12:25.134 --> 12:27.168
- CALL A PLUMBER?
- YOU WANNA PAY FOR IT?

12:27.170 --> 12:29.073
GOOD LUCK.

12:30.606 --> 12:32.607
WELL, DAMN.

12:32.609 --> 12:35.010
NOW I'M IN THE MOOD
FOR ICE CREAM.

12:39.282 --> 12:41.248
- HELLO?
- LAUREN.

12:41.250 --> 12:43.083
ARE YOU CALLING ME?

12:43.085 --> 12:44.586
SHOULD I NOT HAVE CALLED?

12:44.588 --> 12:46.588
IT'S JUST WEIRD.

12:46.590 --> 12:48.589
IT'S WEIRD THAT YOU THINK
IT'S WEIRD.

12:48.591 --> 12:50.257
LOOK,
I'M SORRY IF I WAS MISLEADING.

12:50.259 --> 12:52.761
I'M JUST NOT LOOKING
FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS.

12:52.763 --> 12:54.795
WHY'D YOU KISS ME THEN?

12:54.797 --> 12:58.632
I...
IT SEEMED LIKE IT WOULD BE FUN.

12:58.634 --> 13:00.702
SO YOU DON'T WANNA SEE
EACH OTHER AGAIN?

13:00.704 --> 13:02.703
NOT RIGHT NOW.

13:02.705 --> 13:04.705
CAN I ASK WHY?

13:04.707 --> 13:06.708
I'M JUST NOT
LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP.

13:06.710 --> 13:08.709
NOT WITH ME, YOU MEAN.

13:08.711 --> 13:10.712
YOU'RE LIKE A COLLEGE KID.

13:10.714 --> 13:12.713
I MEAN, WHO WEARS A T-SHIRT
ON A FIRST DATE?

13:12.715 --> 13:15.717
IT'S KINDA HARD
TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY.

13:15.719 --> 13:18.053
O-KAY.

13:18.055 --> 13:19.957
GOOD LUCK.

13:26.629 --> 13:28.329
LEISURE VALLEY.

13:28.331 --> 13:29.764
YOU SOUND LIKE
YOU WERE JUST FIRED.

13:29.766 --> 13:31.098
I WISH. NOBODY'S HERE.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.833
I WANNA GO HOME.

13:32.835 --> 13:34.336
CHRISTMAS ISN'T A VERY POPULAR
TIME TO GET SICK.

13:34.338 --> 13:36.637
CHRISTMAS IS THE MOST
POPULAR TIME TO GET SICK.

13:36.639 --> 13:38.372
MAYBE GET SICK OF YOUR FAMILY,
NOT CONTRACT A VIRUS.

13:38.374 --> 13:40.208
HA.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.943
WELL, WHEN YOU'RE DONE
YOU WANNA GO OUT SOMEWHERE?

13:41.945 --> 13:43.844
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M PROBABLY JUST GONNA GO HOME.

13:43.846 --> 13:45.780
I... I HAVE NO ONE ELSE TO CALL.

13:45.782 --> 13:47.681
I'VE BEEN UP SINCE 5:30

13:47.683 --> 13:50.117
AND I'M SUPER TIRED AND, YES,
I KNOW I'M BEING LAME.

13:50.119 --> 13:53.154
YOU STILL SEEING
THAT BUMBLE GUY, BEN FRANKLIN?

13:53.156 --> 13:54.389
WE BROKE UP.

13:54.391 --> 13:56.657
IS IT BECAUSE HIS NAME
IS BEN FRANKLIN?

13:56.659 --> 13:57.958
BECAUSE HE'S SUPER SENSITIVE

13:57.960 --> 13:59.694
AND I'M A CRAZY PERSON.

13:59.696 --> 14:01.762
DID HE HAVE FOUNDING
FATHER ISSUES?

14:01.764 --> 14:03.798
HILARIOUS.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.834
WELL, THAT SUCKS.
I'M... I'M SORRY.

14:06.836 --> 14:09.003
IT'S ALL RIGHT. I PROBABLY NEED
A BREAK FROM DATING ANYWAY.

14:09.005 --> 14:10.738
ISN'T YOUR BIRTHDAY COMING UP?

14:10.740 --> 14:11.939
THE 23RD.

14:11.941 --> 14:13.107
AS IN LIKE TWO WEEKS?

14:13.109 --> 14:14.342
MM-HMM.

14:14.344 --> 14:16.745
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD DO
SOMETHING BIG.

14:16.747 --> 14:19.680
STEF, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
LET'S DEFINITELY DO SOMETHING BIG.

14:19.682 --> 14:21.882
ACTUALLY, DON'T DO ANYTHING.
I'LL ORGANIZE A RAGER.

14:21.884 --> 14:23.385
HOW... HOW OLD ARE YOU TURNING?

14:23.387 --> 14:24.785
MM.

14:24.787 --> 14:26.154
- 30?
- YEAH.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.022
OKAY.

14:28.024 --> 14:30.424
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA FIND
A MASSIVE HOUSE IN THE HILLS,

14:30.426 --> 14:33.093
AND... AND WE WILL INVITE
ALL OF THE PEOPLE.

14:33.095 --> 14:34.795
OKAY.

14:34.797 --> 14:35.997
I'LL EVEN
INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FRIEND

14:35.999 --> 14:38.132
FDR. HE'S AN ABSOLUTE DIME.

14:38.134 --> 14:40.200
FAYE!
I GOTTA GO.

14:40.202 --> 14:42.105
ALL RIGHT. BYE, STEF.

14:49.178 --> 14:50.944
YO.

14:50.946 --> 14:53.714
HOLY SHIT,
IT'S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE.

14:53.716 --> 14:56.117
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I'M HONESTLY AMAZED THAT YOU ANSWERED.

14:56.119 --> 14:58.319
YEAH, YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON THAT
I KNOW THAT STILL CALLS ANYMORE.

14:58.321 --> 14:59.987
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

14:59.989 --> 15:01.823
I'M ON BREAK.
GOTTA WORK ALL NIGHT, THOUGH.

15:01.825 --> 15:03.157
YOU'RE HOOKING UP WITH SOMEONE.

15:03.159 --> 15:04.892
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS THINK
I'M HOOKING UP WITH SOMEONE?

15:04.894 --> 15:06.694
I'D DO THE SAME
IF IT WERE THAT EASY.

15:06.696 --> 15:08.896
- TOUCHÉ.
- YOU GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS?

15:08.898 --> 15:10.765
NAH, I GOTTA WORK.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

15:10.767 --> 15:12.802
I'M A JEW. I HEAR CHRISTMAS
AND I THINK CHICKEN LO MEIN.

15:14.071 --> 15:15.770
OOH.

15:15.772 --> 15:17.072
- THANK YOU.
- OF COURSE.

15:17.074 --> 15:18.707
HEY, YOU KNOW, MAN,
I GOTTA GET GOING.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.208
THE WORLD NEEDS
MORE MEN LIKE YOU.

15:21.210 --> 15:23.377
AND TINDER NEEDS MORE WOMEN
LIKE YOU.

15:23.379 --> 15:25.380
- WHAT?
- SORRY, I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE ELSE.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.381
OKAY. I'LL CALL YOU BACK
LATER, YEAH?

15:27.383 --> 15:28.482
AH, LATER.

15:28.484 --> 15:30.388
OKAY.

16:02.952 --> 16:05.953
- HEY.
- HEY.

16:05.955 --> 16:08.289
SO, UH, WHAT'S UP?

16:08.291 --> 16:09.958
I THOUGHT WE WERE MEETING
AT YOUR PLACE.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.293
NO. I TOLD YOU I CAN'T HOST.
I GOT A ROOMMATE

16:12.295 --> 16:15.295
WELL, I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED
IN HOOKING UP IN YOUR CAR, DUDE.

16:15.297 --> 16:16.497
YOU GOT A ROOM?

16:16.499 --> 16:17.531
YEAH, I TOLD YOU.

16:17.533 --> 16:19.434
YOU GOT ROOMMATES THOUGH, RIGHT?

16:19.436 --> 16:22.270
I'VE GOT ONE ROOMMATE WHO'S COME
OUT ONCE IN THE LAST YEAR.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.938
OUT OF HIS ROOM.

16:23.940 --> 16:26.540
YEAH, LISTEN,
I DON'T DO THIS KINDA SHIT.

16:26.542 --> 16:28.142
I GOT A GIRLFRIEND AT HOME,

16:28.144 --> 16:29.877
SO EITHER WE JUST DO IT
IN THE CAR

16:29.879 --> 16:32.213
- OR WE CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
- YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND?

16:32.215 --> 16:34.015
DOES SHE KNOW YOU'RE BI?

16:34.017 --> 16:36.117
I'M NOT BI.
I'M STRAIGHT.

16:36.119 --> 16:38.886
RIGHT. WELL, YOU'RE MEETING UP
WITH A GUY FROM GRINDR,

16:38.888 --> 16:40.088
SO YOU'RE NOT STRAIGHT.

16:40.090 --> 16:42.022
I'M NOT GAY.

16:42.024 --> 16:44.058
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GETTING
AT, I LIKE GIRLS.

16:44.060 --> 16:46.327
WITH GUYS, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST PHYSICAL.

16:46.329 --> 16:48.362
CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT,

16:48.364 --> 16:50.430
I JUST WISH YOU WOULD'VE
TOLD ME BEFORE I...

16:50.432 --> 16:52.099

16:52.101 --> 16:54.102
SO WHO GIVES A SHIT

16:54.104 --> 16:55.870
I'M NOT HERE TO JUST DO IT,
OKAY?

16:55.872 --> 16:57.405
ESPECIALLY NOT IN THE BACK
OF YOUR VAN.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.006
WE'RE IN THE FRONT
OF A FORD EXPLORER.

16:59.008 --> 17:00.208
COOL. SORRY.

17:00.210 --> 17:03.144
THIS ISN'T A DATE, BRO.

17:03.146 --> 17:05.146
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A DATE.

17:05.147 --> 17:07.848
OKAY? YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M JUST GONNA...

17:07.849 --> 17:09.884

17:09.886 --> 17:12.051
I DON'T KNOW, JUST NOT THIS.
CAN YOU LET ME OUT?

17:12.054 --> 17:14.821
- FOR REAL?
- YEAH.

17:14.824 --> 17:17.290
I THINK YOU AND I ARE LOOKING
FOR DIFFERENT THINGS, OKAY?

17:17.292 --> 17:19.195

20:14.003 --> 20:15.736
I EARNED EVERYTHING

20:15.738 --> 20:17.538
AND IT'S ALL MINE.

20:17.540 --> 20:19.072
IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

20:19.074 --> 20:20.375

21:10.827 --> 21:12.527
INVITE HIM, INVITE HIM.

21:12.529 --> 21:14.194
YOU KNOW, I WAS NEVER SINGLE

21:14.196 --> 21:16.431
DURING THAT WHOLE ENTIRE, LIKE,
ONLINE DATING THING.

21:16.433 --> 21:18.499
HE JUST HAD A FACEBOOK FLING.

21:18.501 --> 21:20.835
- UH.
- YEAH, AN OLD HIGH SCHOOL FLAME TRIED

21:20.837 --> 21:22.569
TO RECONNECT WITH HIM
ON FACEBOOK.

21:22.571 --> 21:24.105
WHAT... WHAT DID SHE SAY TO YOU,
BABY?

21:24.107 --> 21:26.540
SOMETHING LIKE, "HEY, D,

21:26.542 --> 21:29.210
REMEMBER THOSE STEAMY NIGHTS
IN THE BACK OF YOUR TRANS AM?"

21:29.212 --> 21:32.146
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
SHE'S MARRIED NOW

21:32.148 --> 21:33.414
AND SHE'S JUST A MEMORY.

21:33.416 --> 21:34.714
AND SHE WAS FLIRTING WITH YOU.

21:34.716 --> 21:38.118
SHE WAS... NOT...
NOT HOW I INTERPRETED IT.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.520
NO, AND BESIDES,
I TOLD HER, I SAID,

21:39.522 --> 21:41.422
"HEY, NO, LOOK.
YOU KNOW, I AM MARRIED

21:41.424 --> 21:43.324
TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD."

21:43.326 --> 21:45.659
AWW. I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS WANT

21:45.661 --> 21:48.195
SOME TINDER RANDO ROAMING
AROUND YOUR HOUSE.

21:48.197 --> 21:50.464
HEY, ¿POR QUÉ NO?

21:50.466 --> 21:52.466
IF HE'S A CREEPER...

21:52.468 --> 21:54.167
I'M GONNA KNOCK HIS TEETH OUT.

21:54.169 --> 21:56.203
WELL, LET ME SEE

21:56.205 --> 21:58.205

21:58.207 --> 22:00.774
HEY, WHAT'S...

22:00.776 --> 22:02.443
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S A FILMMAKER,

22:02.445 --> 22:03.677
SO I THINK HE'S, LIKE,

22:03.679 --> 22:05.646

22:05.648 --> 22:06.848

22:06.850 --> 22:08.648
WHY'S HE SO SKINNY?

22:08.650 --> 22:12.552
HEY, BABY, COMPARED TO THESE,

22:12.554 --> 22:14.187

22:14.189 --> 22:16.692
OH, HE... HE MESSAGED YOU.

22:17.724 --> 22:19.260
"DOES IT MATTER
THAT I'M JEWISH?"

22:19.262 --> 22:21.662
WHY WOULD HE ASK IF IT MATTERS
IF HE'S JEWISH?

22:21.664 --> 22:23.630
'CAUSE I SAID
I'M AT A CHRISTMAS PARTY.

22:23.632 --> 22:26.200
OH, SO YOU ALREADY
INVITED HIM, THEN.

22:26.202 --> 22:27.467

22:36.646 --> 22:40.882

22:57.766 --> 22:59.399

22:59.401 --> 23:01.168
- WE COULD DO WITHOUT IT.
- YEAH.

23:01.170 --> 23:02.435
YEAH, I DON'T NEED IT.

23:02.437 --> 23:03.937
ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

23:03.939 --> 23:06.473
JUST GONNA MAKE A LITTLE MOVE

23:06.475 --> 23:07.707
CAREFUL, I'M HEAVY.

23:07.709 --> 23:09.210
NO, YOU'RE LIGHT AS A BIRD.

23:09.212 --> 23:10.411
THIN AS A MACBOOK.

23:12.581 --> 23:14.714
ALL RIGHT.

23:14.716 --> 23:16.751
OKAY.

23:16.753 --> 23:19.921
HELLO.

23:19.923 --> 23:22.589
HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU
HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE?

23:22.591 --> 23:24.925
YES.

23:24.927 --> 23:26.696
BUT I LIKE HEARING IT.

23:29.831 --> 23:30.868
YOUR TURN.

23:33.203 --> 23:37.305
TO THE MOST MAGICAL
THREE MONTHS OF MY LIFE,

23:37.307 --> 23:42.210
AND TO STARTING A NEW CHAPTER
IN L.A. IN...

23:42.212 --> 23:43.881
OH, MY GOSH!
IN JUST THREE WEEKS?

23:46.215 --> 23:47.748
LOOK. MY HAND.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.885
IT'S TREMBLING AT THE THOUGHT
OF YOU BEING HERE.

23:50.887 --> 23:53.887
I CAN'T WAIT TO BE THERE
WITH YOU.

23:53.889 --> 23:55.990
I FEEL LIKE I WAS BORN HERE
BY ACCIDENT.

23:55.992 --> 24:00.261
OH. WELL, I'M SURE YOUR PARENTS
LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.

24:00.263 --> 24:01.662
OH.

24:01.664 --> 24:04.665
NO. I DON'T MEAN
I'M AN ACCIDENT.

24:04.667 --> 24:07.667
IT WAS JUST A JOKE ABOUT HOW NO
ONE LIVES IN WISCONSIN ON PURPOSE.

24:07.669 --> 24:09.270
I SEE.

24:09.272 --> 24:10.637
THAT'S FUNNY.

24:10.639 --> 24:13.441
- CHEERS.
- CHEERS.

24:13.443 --> 24:16.610
SMELLS LIKE A SENIOR CENTER
IN HERE.

24:16.612 --> 24:18.646
ADAM JUST WALKED IN.

24:18.648 --> 24:20.380
HI, ADAM!

24:20.382 --> 24:21.781

24:21.783 --> 24:23.717
HEY! HEY, SOPHIE!

24:23.719 --> 24:25.752
YOU GUYS ARE SERIOUSLY ADORABLE.

24:27.756 --> 24:29.557
SON OF A BITCH.

24:29.559 --> 24:30.758
THIS KEEPS HAPPENING.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.460
EVERY TIME I SAY A WORD
WITH SIRI IN IT,

24:32.462 --> 24:34.261
MY PHONE THINKS
I'M TALKING TO IT.

24:34.263 --> 24:37.264
HEY, LOOK. I'M SERIOUS.

24:37.266 --> 24:39.000
I'M SERIOUS.

24:39.002 --> 24:41.368
SERIAL KILLER.

24:41.370 --> 24:43.738
I WANT A BOWL OF CEREAL.

24:43.740 --> 24:45.438
- SIRI!
- THERE'S A SETTING FOR THAT, MAN.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.274
IT'S NOT EVEN WORKING NOW.

24:47.276 --> 24:48.943
I'LL SHOW YOU LATER.

24:48.945 --> 24:50.810
ALL RIGHT.
UH, WELL, REAL QUICK.

24:50.812 --> 24:52.680
MY 5-4 PACKAGE HASN'T COME YET.

24:52.682 --> 24:53.914
CAN I BORROW A JACKET?

24:53.916 --> 24:55.816
MAYBE A SWAB OR TWO
OF DEODORANT?

24:55.818 --> 24:58.485
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR DEODORANT?
- I GOT THE GEL KIND.

24:58.487 --> 25:00.053
IT'S LIKE SLIMY AND GROSS.
I JUST... I HATE IT.

25:00.055 --> 25:02.356
YEAH, OKAY.

25:06.495 --> 25:08.896
WHERE WERE WE?

25:08.898 --> 25:11.831
UH, DAVEY, MY COMPUTER'S DYING,

25:11.833 --> 25:13.033
AND I LEFT MY CHARGER AT WORK.

LET'S TALK TOMORROW?

25:15.038 --> 25:16.503
OH, OKAY.

25:16.505 --> 25:18.039

25:18.041 --> 25:19.607
I'M SORRY.
I WANNA FINISH,

25:19.609 --> 25:21.008
BUT I'M AT ONE PERCENT.

25:21.010 --> 25:22.777
I'LL TEXT YOU FROM THE OFFICE.

25:22.779 --> 25:24.578
SURE. YEAH.

25:24.580 --> 25:26.946
UH, LET'S DO THAT.

25:26.948 --> 25:29.416
UH, SLEEP TIGHT.

25:29.418 --> 25:31.652
UH, SLEEP WELL.

25:31.654 --> 25:33.654

GOOD NIGHT.

25:44.867 --> 25:46.770

25:51.907 --> 25:54.008
I SAID NOTHING LEFT
OF THE SWEATER VEST, ADAM.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.876
- WHAT ARE YOU...

25:55.878 --> 25:56.911
I LOVE THIS JACKET.

25:56.913 --> 25:58.546
MINUS THE RATTLING NOISE.

25:58.548 --> 26:00.947
I DON'T WANNA MISLEAD
ANY HOMELESS PEOPLE.

26:00.949 --> 26:02.383

26:02.385 --> 26:04.719
I HEARD THE END.
OF YOUR CONVERSATION,

26:04.721 --> 26:06.857
HOPEFULLY NOT THE RELATIONSHIP.

26:07.990 --> 26:10.357
WHAT IS ON MY JACKET?

26:10.359 --> 26:12.693
OH, IT'S PROBABLY
JUST DEODORANT.

26:12.695 --> 26:16.696
HOW'D YOU GET DEODORANT
ON THAT PART OF THE JACKET?

26:16.698 --> 26:18.432
I'LL JUST GRAB ANOTHER ONE.

26:18.434 --> 26:20.000
THIS IS A RANDOM THOUGHT,

26:20.002 --> 26:23.807
BUT WHY DIDN'T SHE JUST CALL YOU

28:59.829 --> 29:01.095

29:27.756 --> 29:29.188
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE YOU MEET SOMEBODY.

29:29.190 --> 29:31.625
TINDER'S JUST ONE
OF A MILLION PLATFORMS.

29:31.627 --> 29:33.193
HAVEN'T YOU WONDERED
IF THESE DATING APPS

29:33.195 --> 29:35.229
ATTRACT A CERTAIN TYPE
OF PERSON?

29:35.231 --> 29:37.097
LIKE PEOPLE
WHO JUST WANT HOOKUPS

29:37.099 --> 29:39.899
OR WEIRDOS CATFISHING
FROM THEIR MOM'S BASEMENTS?

29:39.901 --> 29:41.734
I THINK I'M A PRETTY NORMAL GUY

29:41.736 --> 29:43.636
AND I CAN'T MEET ANYBODY
ANYWHERE.

29:43.638 --> 29:45.071
SO YOU THINK YOU'RE NORMAL, HUH?

29:45.073 --> 29:47.241
WELL, MY MOM SEEMS TO THINK SO.

29:47.243 --> 29:50.144
THEN AGAIN I HAVE BEEN OUT HERE
FOR SEVEN YEARS,

29:50.146 --> 29:53.180
AND, I DON'T KNOW, ANY TIME
I SEEM TO LIKE SOMEBODY

29:53.182 --> 29:54.647
THEY NEVER LIKE ME BACK.

29:54.649 --> 29:56.082
REALLY?

29:56.084 --> 29:58.819
I COULD BUILD A COLLAGE
OF ALL THE REJECTION TEXTS

29:58.821 --> 30:01.088
- THAT I'VE EVER RECEIVED.
- GOD, THAT SURPRISES ME.

30:01.090 --> 30:03.089
IT DOES.

30:03.091 --> 30:04.591
NO, I'VE TRIED 'EM ALL, TOO.

30:04.593 --> 30:07.595
LIKE BUMBLE, OKCUPID, JDATE,

30:07.597 --> 30:09.762
JSWIPE, EVEN CHRISTIAN MINGLE

30:09.764 --> 30:11.764
TO TRY MY HAND AT THE SHIKSAS.

30:11.766 --> 30:14.100
WAIT, WHAT ARE SHIKSAS?

30:14.102 --> 30:17.006
UH, THEY'RE, UH, ACCORDING
TO MY GRANDPA, PRACTICE.

30:18.773 --> 30:20.773
NEVER MIND.

30:22.778 --> 30:25.346
IS THIS SEXY THAT I'M TELLING
YOU ALL THIS?

30:25.348 --> 30:28.682
- I... YOU'RE DOING PRETTY GREAT SO FAR.
- IS THIS SMOOTH?

30:28.684 --> 30:31.719
GUYS ARE LIKE THE BALL
IN A PINBALL MACHINE,

30:31.721 --> 30:33.654
AND GIRLS ARE LIKE
THE LITTLE FLIPPER,

30:33.656 --> 30:35.021
PUSHING THEM
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

30:35.023 --> 30:37.191
OKAY, GUYS AND GIRLS
SHOULD PUSH EACH OTHER.

30:37.193 --> 30:38.925
WE SHOULD BE EQUALLY SUPPORTIVE.

30:38.927 --> 30:40.927
YEAH, BUT GUYS ARE
ONE-DIMENSIONAL.

30:40.929 --> 30:42.930
YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM
FOR ONLY WANTING ONE THING,

30:42.932 --> 30:44.964
JUST LIKE YOU CAN'T BLAME THE
BALL FOR GOING TOWARD THE DRAIN.

30:44.966 --> 30:46.634
YOU MEAN THE HOLE.

30:46.636 --> 30:49.103
GUYS ARE LIKE BALLS
AND GIRLS ARE LIKE THE HOLE.

30:49.105 --> 30:50.404
I'M ACTUALLY SHOOTING
A MUSIC VIDEO TOMORROW.

30:50.406 --> 30:51.838
TOMORROW?

30:51.840 --> 30:53.206
- MM-HMM.
- YOU'RE OUT DRINKING?

30:53.208 --> 30:55.108
IT'S A NIGHT SHOOT,
SO I CAN SLEEP IN.

30:55.110 --> 30:57.077
WHAT IS IT ABOUT?

30:57.079 --> 30:59.847
IT'S ABOUT THIS ELDERLY COUPLE
THAT HAVE FALLEN OUT OF LOVE.

30:59.849 --> 31:02.782
ONE DAY THE HUSBAND GOES
TO AN ANTIQUE SHOP

31:02.784 --> 31:04.652
AND FINDS THIS LAMP.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.720
- LAMP?
- LAMP, YEAH.

31:06.722 --> 31:07.954
LIKE A THING THAT EMITS LIGHT.

31:07.956 --> 31:10.023
I KNOW WHAT A LAMP IS.
THANK YOU.

31:10.025 --> 31:12.792
HEY, I'M NOT JUDGING. I JUST FOUND
OUT WHAT A DUVET IS YESTERDAY.

31:12.794 --> 31:17.297
SO, ANYWAY, HE, UH,
THAT NIGHT, FLIPS THE LAMP ON,

31:17.299 --> 31:19.232
AND WHAT DOES HE SEE?

31:19.234 --> 31:22.703
HIS WIFE IS THE SAME AGE
AS THE DAY THAT THEY FIRST MET.

31:22.705 --> 31:26.173
SO HE RUNS TO THE MIRROR AND
HE, TOO, IS 50 YEARS YOUNGER.

31:26.175 --> 31:29.710
IT TRANSFORMED WHEREVER
THE LAMP CAST ITS LIGHT.

31:29.712 --> 31:31.678
THEY FALL BACK IN LOVE

31:31.680 --> 31:33.914
UNTIL THE END WHEN THE BULB
GOES OUT AND THEN THEY DIE.

31:33.916 --> 31:35.315
WHAT?

31:35.317 --> 31:37.117
I'M JUST JOKING.

31:37.119 --> 31:39.118
THEY JUST REMEMBER WHY THEY FELL
IN LOVE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.319
THAT'S SO CUTE.

31:40.321 --> 31:42.056
I LIKE THAT.

31:42.058 --> 31:44.758
THE LAMP'S LIKE
A METAPHOR FOR LOVE,

31:44.760 --> 31:47.828
THE LOVE THAT WAS LOST IN THE
DARKNESS IS FOUND IN THE LIGHT.

31:47.830 --> 31:49.463
- PROFOUND.
- MM. YOU SHOULD COME.

31:49.465 --> 31:53.399
BRING YOUR CAMERA,
BE OUR ON-SET PHOTOGRAPHER.

31:53.401 --> 31:54.902
- OKAY.
- YEAH?

31:54.904 --> 31:56.270
YEAH.

31:56.272 --> 31:57.771
SO I GET TO SEE YOU TOMORROW.

31:57.773 --> 31:59.740
CAN'T WAIT.

31:59.742 --> 32:03.042
OKAY, SO WE COVERED
DATING, WE COVERED WORK.

32:03.044 --> 32:05.111
TELL ME...
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.

32:05.113 --> 32:07.146
UGH. YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW?

32:07.148 --> 32:09.148
WELL,
NOW YOU'VE PIQUED MY INTEREST, YEAH.

32:09.150 --> 32:12.152
OKAY. MY GRANDMA WAS AMAZING.

32:12.154 --> 32:15.422
I ACTUALLY LIVED WITH HER
FOR, LIKE, PART OF MY CHILDHOOD.

32:15.424 --> 32:17.191
MY PARENTS WERE GREAT.

32:17.193 --> 32:19.460
THEY'RE REALLY,
REALLY GREAT HUMANS,

32:19.462 --> 32:22.495
BUT THEY CHEATED ON EACH OTHER
A BUNCH.

32:22.497 --> 32:25.799
I HAVE THIS, LIKE, MEMORY OF BEING
IN THE BACKSEAT OF MY MOM'S CAR

32:25.801 --> 32:27.835
WHILE WE STAKED OUT
THE OTHER WOMAN'S HOUSE,

32:27.837 --> 32:30.169
JUST, LIKE, WAITING
FOR MY DAD TO COME OUT,

32:30.171 --> 32:33.206
AND HE DID AND IT JUST GOT
SUPER CRAZY AND MESSY.

32:33.208 --> 32:36.109
AND THEN SHE CHEATED ON HIM
TOWARDS THE END OF THEIR MARRIAGE,

32:36.111 --> 32:37.810
JUST LIKE ONE LAST JAB AT HIM.

32:37.812 --> 32:39.746
- THAT SOUNDS INTENSE.
- YEAH,

32:39.748 --> 32:42.750
NOT THE FINEST HOUR
IN WARREN FAMILY HISTORY.

32:42.752 --> 32:44.851
BUT THEY'RE FINE NOW.
I MEAN, SEPARATELY.

32:44.853 --> 32:46.986
AND I WENT TO LIVE
WITH MY GRANDMA IN CONNECTICUT

32:46.988 --> 32:48.821
FOR A WHILE AFTER THAT,

32:48.823 --> 32:52.259
WHICH WAS PROBABLY THE BEST
DECISION I EVER MADE.

32:52.261 --> 32:54.528
WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS?
I'M SORRY.

32:54.530 --> 32:56.195
I'M PROBABLY BEING, LIKE,
WAY MORE OPEN THAN I SHOULD.

32:56.197 --> 32:58.464
NO, NO, NO. NOT AT...
NOT AT ALL.

32:58.466 --> 33:00.134
I'M... I'M IMPRESSED.

33:00.136 --> 33:02.802
YOUR GRANDMA DID A GREAT JOB
RAISING YOU.

33:02.804 --> 33:04.404
SHE'S LIKE MRS. DOUBTFIRE,

33:04.406 --> 33:07.974
ONLY AN ACTUAL WOMAN AND
NOT YOUR DAD DRESSED IN DRAG.

33:07.976 --> 33:09.976
THAT'D BE DISTURBING.

33:09.978 --> 33:11.310
AND QUITE PROGRESSIVE.

33:11.312 --> 33:13.079
TRULY AHEAD OF ITS TIME,
THAT MOVIE.

33:13.081 --> 33:15.115
- IT WAS.
- MM.

33:15.117 --> 33:17.283
YEAH, I'M... I'M REALLY SURPRISED
YOU CALLED ME.

33:17.285 --> 33:19.153
- WHEN?
- EARLIER TONIGHT,

33:19.155 --> 33:20.354
BEFORE WE MET YOU CALLED.

33:20.356 --> 33:22.556
WOULD YOU HAVE PREFERRED
I TEXTED?

33:22.558 --> 33:24.090
NO. I LOVED IT.

33:24.092 --> 33:28.294
IT WAS, LIKE, VERY SWEET
AND GENTLEMANLY.

33:28.296 --> 33:31.063
WELL,
I'M GLAD THAT YOU APPRECIATED IT.

33:31.065 --> 33:32.965
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT CALL ME
ARE MY PARENTS

33:32.967 --> 33:34.967
OR THOSE AUTOMATED MESSAGES
SAYING I'VE BEEN APPROVED

33:34.969 --> 33:36.970
FOR A $20,000 LOAN.

33:36.972 --> 33:39.039
WE SHOULD MAKE A DEAL

33:39.041 --> 33:42.943
THAT ALL FUTURE FORMS OF
COMMUNICATION, PHONE CALL ONLY.

33:42.945 --> 33:44.243
I'LL ONE UP YOU.

33:44.245 --> 33:46.445
HOW ABOUT ALL FUTURE FORMS
OF COMMUNICATING

33:46.447 --> 33:48.281
MUST BE DONE IN PERSON?

33:48.283 --> 33:51.251
THAT'D MEAN WE'D HAVE
TO SEE EACH OTHER EVERY DAY.

33:51.253 --> 33:52.919
OKAY, SO YOU DIDN'T LET ME
FINISH.

33:52.921 --> 33:56.389
UNLESS WE'RE MAKING PLANS
TO SEE EACH OTHER,

33:56.391 --> 33:58.090
AT WHICH POINT,
YOU KNOW, A PHONE CALL

33:58.092 --> 34:00.126
OR A HANDWRITTEN NOTE WILL DO.

34:00.128 --> 34:01.595
OKAY, IT'S A DEAL.

34:01.597 --> 34:03.563
- SHAKE ON IT?
- YEAH.

34:03.565 --> 34:06.401
IT'S OFFICIAL.

34:51.112 --> 34:54.081
SO YOU TOLD HER YOU LOVE HER
AND SHE DIDN'T SAY IT BACK,

34:54.083 --> 34:56.516
AND NOW YOU'RE WATCHING MY VIDEO BECAUSE
YOU THINK IT'S GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

34:56.518 --> 34:59.052
I'M SORRY FOR YOU, BUDDY, YOU KNOW,
BUT I SPEAK THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH HURTS.

34:59.054 --> 35:01.387
FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S A VERY GOOD
CHANCE SHE DIDN'T LOVE YOU AT ALL.

35:01.389 --> 35:03.257
SHE WAS JUST TRYING
TO SPARE YOUR FEELINGS.

35:03.259 --> 35:04.891
EVERYBODY WANTS CONNECTION
WITHOUT THE CONVERSATION.

35:04.893 --> 35:06.192
SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR ANSWERS,

35:06.194 --> 35:08.094
I SUGGEST YOU REMOVE
THE SUPER GLUE

35:08.096 --> 35:09.630
BONDING YOUR TESTICLES
TO YOUR EGO,

35:09.632 --> 35:11.197
START ASKING SOME
FUCKING QUESTIONS.

35:11.199 --> 35:12.465
SECONDLY, I THINK...

35:12.467 --> 35:13.933
LISTEN TO THIS.

35:13.935 --> 35:15.369
"SO SORRY. I COULDN'T SLEEP.

35:15.371 --> 35:17.570
HAD SO MUCH FUN WITH YOU."
SMILEY FACE.

35:17.572 --> 35:19.338
"EMMA. P.S., REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THE LAMP.

35:19.340 --> 35:21.141
LET ME KNOW
HOW I CAN MAKE IT UP TO YOU."

35:21.143 --> 35:23.242
THAT EXPLAINS THE MESS.

35:23.244 --> 35:25.512
- DID YOU LEAVE MONEY FOR IT?
- NO.

35:25.514 --> 35:27.413
WAIT, SHOULD I HAVE?

35:27.415 --> 35:29.349
DID SHE REALIZE THAT WAS A PROP
FOR YOUR SHOOT TODAY?

35:29.351 --> 35:31.050
IT'S NOT EVEN THE LAMP
THAT I'M UPSET ABOUT.

35:31.052 --> 35:32.985
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE FACT THAT
WE HAD THIS GREAT NIGHT OUT,

35:32.987 --> 35:34.554
FOLLOWED BY A REALLY
GREAT NIGHT IN,

35:34.556 --> 35:36.623
AND THEN SHE'S TAKEN OFF
AS IF IT WERE A ONE-NIGHT STAND.

35:36.625 --> 35:38.458
- MAYBE IT WAS.
- IT WASN'T.

35:38.460 --> 35:39.927
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- SHOULD I CALL HER?

35:39.929 --> 35:41.395
IF I WERE YOU, YEAH.

35:41.397 --> 35:44.630
LOOK, THE EARLY MORNING DIP OUT
IS NOT BENEATH ME,

35:44.632 --> 35:48.302
BUT I AM VERY AWARE THAT SOME
PEOPLE ARE NOT COOL WITH IT.

35:48.304 --> 35:50.304
STOP BITING YOUR CUTICLES.

35:50.306 --> 35:52.271
IT'S DISGUSTING.

35:52.273 --> 35:54.206
IF HE ACTUALLY LIKES ME,
HE'S GONNA REACH OUT, RIGHT?

35:54.208 --> 35:56.476
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD SLOW DOWN.
- IF TINDER EXISTED

35:56.478 --> 35:59.279
WHEN YOUR GRANDPARENTS MET, YOU'D
PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE RIGHT NOW.

35:59.281 --> 36:01.380
MY GRANDMA WOULD'VE JUST SNUCK
OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

36:01.382 --> 36:03.215
AND FOUND SOME OTHER SCHMUCK
FIVE MILES AWAY.

36:03.217 --> 36:04.985
WHY YOU BRINGING
MY GRANDPARENTS INTO THIS?

36:04.987 --> 36:06.453
BECAUSE, DAVE, THEY HAD IT EASY.

36:06.455 --> 36:08.454
ALL RIGHT,
GHOSTING SOMEBODY IN 1940

36:08.456 --> 36:10.359
JUST MEANT MOVING TO A DIFFERENT AREA CODE.

36:12.594 --> 36:14.161
- WELL, LOOK WHO IT IS.
- I GOT YOUR TEXT.

36:14.163 --> 36:16.195
I'M SORRY, THE ANSWER IS NO.

36:16.197 --> 36:18.130
WELL,
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WITH A LAMP?

36:18.132 --> 36:20.067
- ANYONE AT ALL?
- NOT THE KIND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

36:20.069 --> 36:22.069
AND, HONESTLY, IF I WERE YOU,
I'D HAVE THIS CHICK PAY FOR IT.

36:22.071 --> 36:23.704
RIGHT. WANNA HELP OUT TONIGHT?

36:23.706 --> 36:26.373
IF THIS GIRL ACTUALLY ENDS UP
COMING, I WANT YOU TO MEET HER.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.375
NO, NO, NO. YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SASHAY ME AROUND

36:28.377 --> 36:30.309
SO I COULD PLAY THE PART
OF YOUR GAY BEST FRIEND.

36:30.311 --> 36:32.411
NOBODY WOULD EVER SUSPECT
YOU OF BEING MY BEST FRIEND.

36:32.413 --> 36:34.280
YEAH, THAT'S FAIR.
I GOTTA WORK, THOUGH.

36:34.282 --> 36:36.049
IS THIS WHAT OUR RELATIONSHIP
HAS BECOME,

36:36.051 --> 36:38.217
- JUST A SERIES OF EXCUSES?
- SORRY, MAN, I'M BUSY.

36:38.219 --> 36:40.052
YES, 'CAUSE YOU'RE TOO BUSY
MEETING UP WITH DUDES ON GRINDR.

36:40.054 --> 36:42.288
ACTUALLY, THAT PART
TAKES FIVE MINUTES.

36:42.290 --> 36:44.224
- I'M TALKING ABOUT WORK.
- YOU SHOULD JUST FIND A SUGAR DADDY.

36:44.226 --> 36:45.558
WHY DON'T YOU FIND
A SUGAR DADDY?

36:45.560 --> 36:48.362
- EH...
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

36:48.364 --> 36:50.130
ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA GET BACK
TO WORK.

36:50.132 --> 36:51.998
- ALL RIGHT, LATER.
- I'LL TALK TO YOU.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.433
YOU SERIOUS?

36:54.435 --> 36:57.237
I GUESS YOU'RE FROM HOLLYWOOD.

36:57.239 --> 36:58.572
DID HE BRING THE DRINKS?

36:58.574 --> 37:00.407
- JUST GET OUTTA HERE.
- RELAX.

37:00.409 --> 37:02.175
IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE'S GONNA SUSPECT

37:02.177 --> 37:03.346
YOU'RE BANGING THE PIZZA
DELIVERY BOY.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.179
I'M SERIOUS.
IF YOU COME BACK HERE AGAIN,

37:07.181 --> 37:09.449
I'M GONNA THROW YOU OFF
THIS GODDAMN BALCONY.

37:09.451 --> 37:11.351
THAT'S FUNNY TO YOU?

37:11.353 --> 37:13.255
NO, SORRY, JUST NERVES.

37:14.389 --> 37:16.192
JUST GET ME A NEW ONE.

37:17.326 --> 37:19.028
SEND SOMEBODY ELSE.

37:21.496 --> 37:25.032
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M GETTING
SO INSIDE MY HEAD ABOUT THIS.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.800
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GOOGLE IT.

37:26.802 --> 37:28.402
I GOOGLE ALL MY PROBLEMS.

37:28.404 --> 37:29.703
YOU'VE BEEN IN A THREE-MONTH
RELATIONSHIP

37:29.705 --> 37:31.605
ON FACETIME
WITH A GIRL YOU MET ONCE.

37:31.607 --> 37:33.639
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
THAT'S A MODERN-DAY FAIRYTALE.

37:33.641 --> 37:35.442
SOUNDS LIKE YOU FELL IN LOVE
LAST NIGHT.

37:35.444 --> 37:37.277
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

37:37.279 --> 37:39.779
I MEAN, I LIKE HER BUT GIVEN
MY TRACK RECORD OF REJECTION,

37:39.781 --> 37:41.213
SHE'LL PROBABLY JUST IGNORE ME.

37:41.215 --> 37:42.581
FOR ALL I KNOW
IT WAS A ONE-NIGHT STAND

37:42.583 --> 37:44.583
AND NOW I'M DRIVING MYSELF
ABSOLUTELY NUTS

37:44.585 --> 37:46.186
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
IF I SHOULD CALL.

37:46.188 --> 37:47.820
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TEXT HER.

37:47.822 --> 37:50.724
- TEXT EMMA? NO, WE GOT THIS...
- TEXTING EMMA.

37:51.125 --> 37:52.324
NO.

37:52.326 --> 37:54.061
NO! NO!

37:54.063 --> 37:57.096
YOU KNOW, IF YOUR FINGERS
ARE FEELING IDLE,

37:57.098 --> 37:58.831
YOU COULD TEXT THAT BEEFCAKE
FROM YESTERDAY.

37:58.833 --> 38:00.166
WHO, WILLIAM? NO.

38:00.168 --> 38:01.601
IF YOU WON'T, I WILL.

38:01.603 --> 38:04.103
BESIDES, YOU DID SAY
THAT HE REMINDED YOU OF...

38:04.105 --> 38:05.605
OH WAIT, HE TEXTED ME.

38:05.607 --> 38:07.474
WHO, BEEFCAKE?

38:07.476 --> 38:10.643
"I MEAN, I WIPE HER BUTT GIVEN
MY TRACK RECORD OF REJECTION.

38:10.645 --> 38:13.179
SHE'LL PROBABLY JUST..."
OH, HE'S CALLING ME NOW. WHAT?

38:13.181 --> 38:15.248
- HELLO?
- HEY.

38:15.250 --> 38:17.483
- DID YOU GET MY TEXT?
- I DID.

38:17.485 --> 38:19.518
I, UH... I'M NOT SURE I FOLLOW.

38:19.520 --> 38:23.123
AH, I WAS JUST... IT'S LIKE PART
OF AN OP-ED PIECE ABOUT MODERN...

38:23.125 --> 38:24.623
IT'S... IT'S STUPID.
JUST IGNORE IT.

38:24.625 --> 38:27.126
IS IT ABOUT US OR...?

38:27.128 --> 38:29.329
UM, NO, JUST, LIKE,
MY EXPERIENCES

38:29.331 --> 38:31.431
WITH DATING IN GENERAL.

38:31.433 --> 38:34.433
ANYWAY, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WEIRDER
NOT TO CALL YOU AT THIS POINT.

38:34.435 --> 38:37.337
NO, I'M... I'M GLAD THAT YOU DID.

38:37.339 --> 38:39.873
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THE LAMP.

38:39.875 --> 38:41.842
I JUST THOUGHT IT'D BE MORE
PERSONAL TO LEAVE A HANDWRITTEN NOTE

38:41.844 --> 38:43.242
INSTEAD OF A TEXT.

38:43.244 --> 38:45.244
YEAH, YOU DID THE BEST
YOU COULD.

38:45.246 --> 38:47.179
I'LL BUY YOU A NEW ONE.

38:47.181 --> 38:50.282
OR I CAN, LIKE, GIVE YOU A GIFT
CARD TO WEST ELM OR SOMETHING.

38:50.284 --> 38:51.650
IT'S... IT'S COOL.

38:51.652 --> 38:54.654
UH, YOU STILL WANNA HELP
WITH THE SHOOT TONIGHT?

38:54.656 --> 38:56.489
YEAH, I DO.

38:56.491 --> 38:58.391
THANK YOU FOR CALLING,
BY THE WAY.

38:58.393 --> 39:00.295
YEAH, THAT'S HOW I DO.

39:02.864 --> 39:04.663
ANYWAY, I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER, OKAY?

39:04.665 --> 39:07.166
- BYE.
- BYE.

39:07.168 --> 39:09.436
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
I AM SEEING HIM TONIGHT.

39:09.438 --> 39:11.304
OH, ISN'T THAT NICE?

39:11.306 --> 39:12.873
ONE LITTLE PHONE CHAT AND
EVERYTHING'S ALL CLEARED UP.

39:12.875 --> 39:15.275
IT WAS NICE OF HIM TO CALL,
THOUGH.

39:15.277 --> 39:16.775
IT WAS, WASN'T IT?

39:16.777 --> 39:18.777
YOU KNOW, I'M HAVING THIS GUEST
ON TOMORROW NIGHT

39:18.779 --> 39:21.815
THAT CAN'T STOP SOCIAL MEDIA
STALKING ONE OF HER BOYFRIENDS.

39:21.817 --> 39:24.784
- ONE OF?
- IF SHE WOULD JUST PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL,

39:24.786 --> 39:26.520
SHE'D PROBABLY
GET MUCH BETTER ANSWERS

39:26.522 --> 39:29.588
THAN SURMISING HIS EVERY MOVE
OFF OF INSTAGRAM PICS.

39:29.590 --> 39:33.159
SPEAKING OF, WHICH ONE OF YOUR MANY
LOVERS ARE YOU STALKING RIGHT NOW?

39:33.161 --> 39:35.328
NONE.

39:35.330 --> 39:37.596
THERE'S THIS ONE GUY,
ABRAHAM ROSEN.

39:37.598 --> 39:39.632
HE KEEPS TROLLING MY WEBSITE.

39:39.634 --> 39:41.333
SINCE WHEN DO YOU CARE
ABOUT INTERNET TROLLS?

39:41.335 --> 39:43.369
AND HE HAS LUNCH
AT THE SAME SPOT EVERY DAY,

39:43.371 --> 39:46.306
- THIS ARMENIAN SPOT UP THE WAY.
- SO?

39:46.308 --> 39:49.942
HE SAID THAT HE WANTED
TO REPORT MY PODCAST

39:49.944 --> 39:53.579
TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SO
THEY COULD CLASSIFY IT AS AN STD.

39:53.581 --> 39:56.248
DAMN.

39:56.250 --> 39:57.918
SO THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE JUST
LIKE EVERY OTHER NIGHT.

39:57.920 --> 40:01.288
OKAY? YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
MARRIED FOR 50 YEARS,

40:01.290 --> 40:04.357
AND ALL THE LOVE AND THE PASSION
THAT WAS ONCE THERE IS GONE.

40:04.359 --> 40:06.192
SO PRETEND HE'S MY REAL HUSBAND.

40:06.194 --> 40:09.262
- EXACTLY. YEAH.
- I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM, OKAY?

40:09.264 --> 40:11.434
- YEAH, PLEASE. YOU?
- NO.

40:13.569 --> 40:15.302
- WATER?
- OH, NO, NO.

40:15.304 --> 40:16.772
THANK YOU.

40:22.243 --> 40:24.344
SO MY FRIEND SHOULD BE HERE ANY
SECOND WITH THE REPLACEMENT LAMP,

40:24.346 --> 40:25.612
- AND THEN WE'LL RUN A REHEARSAL.
- OKAY.

40:25.614 --> 40:27.413
YOU WANT ME TO BE READING, TOO,

40:27.415 --> 40:29.648
OR SHOULD I BE TRYING TO SLEEP
AND HE'S WAKING ME UP

40:29.650 --> 40:30.916
WITH HIS FAKAKTA LAMP?

40:30.918 --> 40:33.520
UH, I THINK YOU SHOULD
BE READING, TOO.

40:33.522 --> 40:36.288
YEAH, IT'S LIKE A ROUTINE, ONLY
TONIGHT DOESN'T GO AS PLANNED.

40:36.290 --> 40:38.224
- GOTCHA!
- STEF, YOU'RE A LIFE SAVER.

40:38.226 --> 40:39.659
WHY DON'T WE TAKE JUST
LIKE A 30-MINUTE BREAK

40:39.661 --> 40:41.494
AND THEN WE'LL PICK UP
WHERE WE LEFT OFF?

40:41.496 --> 40:42.661
- SURE.
- ALL RIGHT.

40:42.663 --> 40:45.232
30 MINUTES!

40:45.234 --> 40:47.467
- HI!
- THIS IS AMAZING. THANK YOU.

40:47.469 --> 40:49.735
JUST BE CAREFUL WITH HER,
MY AUNT GAVE HER TO ME.

40:49.737 --> 40:51.904
I WILL TREAT HER LIKE
SHE IS MY ONLY CHILD.

40:51.906 --> 40:54.507
UM, THIS IS...
THIS IS EMMA, BY THE WAY,

40:54.509 --> 40:56.442
OUR AMAZING ON-SET PHOTOGRAPHER.

40:56.444 --> 40:57.677
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

40:57.679 --> 40:59.346
I'M THE ONE WHO BROKE THE LAMP.

40:59.348 --> 41:02.549
SO, THE BROKEN LAMP CULPRIT.

41:02.551 --> 41:04.617
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THIS...

41:04.619 --> 41:07.654
THEN I WILL PAY YOU AND YOUR AUNT
THREE TIMES WHAT IT IS WORTH.

41:07.656 --> 41:09.788
NO, I THINK THEN YOU'LL MAKE
MY BIRTHDAY PARTY

41:09.790 --> 41:11.523
- THREE TIMES MORE FUN.
- IF YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY

41:11.525 --> 41:13.492
ISN'T LIKE MAXIMUM FUN THEN
I HAVE FAILED YOU AS A FRIEND.

41:13.494 --> 41:15.328
I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO COME.

41:15.330 --> 41:17.630

WITH CHRISTMAS, NEW YEAR'S.

41:17.632 --> 41:19.733

41:25.641 --> 41:26.940
SHE JUST GAVE ME THE TICKETS.

41:26.942 --> 41:28.608
I'M SO DOWN.

41:28.610 --> 41:30.643
I'M GONNA BUY YOU A T-SHIRT
THIS TIME.

41:30.645 --> 41:31.777
UM, DO YOU HAVE AN EXTRA TICKET?

41:31.779 --> 41:33.512
SHE ONLY GAVE ME TWO,

44:26.654 --> 44:28.487

47:22.697 --> 47:25.764
I WAS JUST GONNA SAY THAT I'M
SURPRISED YOU'RE UP THIS EARLY.

47:44.319 --> 47:47.954
OH, YEAH, UM,
SHE BLEW ME OFF LAST SECOND.

47:47.956 --> 47:49.422
OH, REALLY, YOU SHOULD HAVE
CALLED ME.

47:49.424 --> 47:51.391
I WAS HOME BEFORE MIDNIGHT.
WE COULD HAVE HIT UP

47:51.393 --> 47:56.195
THAT WEIRD BACKYARD CANTINA
FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF KARAOKE.

47:56.197 --> 48:00.299
WELL, I WAS, UM...
I WAS WONDERING IF

48:00.301 --> 48:04.737
YOU'D LIKE TO GO OUT ON A SUPER
ROMANTIC SECOND DATE TONIGHT.

48:04.739 --> 48:06.806
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.
- WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

48:06.808 --> 48:09.808
- YOU'RE SO WRONG!
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT SO DEFINITIVELY?

48:09.810 --> 48:11.277
YOU HAVE AN INVERTED
TRACK PAD.

48:11.279 --> 48:12.945
- DO NOT.
- YES, INVERTED IS AN OPPOSITE,

48:12.947 --> 48:14.746
UPSIDE DOWN.

48:14.748 --> 48:17.949
NO, IF YOU PUT YOUR FINGERS
ON A TRACK PAD, YOU PUSH UP.

48:17.951 --> 48:20.018
LIKE, YOU'RE LITERALLY PUSHING
THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE

48:20.020 --> 48:21.353
IN AN UPWARD DIRECTION.

48:21.355 --> 48:23.121
WHEN I SLIDE MY FINGERS UP
IT MAKES SENSE

48:23.123 --> 48:24.991
THAT THE PAGE WOULD MIRROR
THE UPWARD MOTION.

48:24.993 --> 48:27.159
- THAT'S LOGIC, YES!
- NO, NO!

48:27.161 --> 48:29.161
WHATEVER, YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN SLIDE YOUR FINGERS

48:29.163 --> 48:30.429
WHEREVER YOU WANT,
I DON'T CARE.

48:30.431 --> 48:31.998
CAN I QUOTE YOU ON THAT?

48:32.000 --> 48:34.902
UM, IF YOU USE

YOU'VE EVER SAID TO ME.

50:41.596 --> 50:43.128
DO I KNOW YOU?

50:43.130 --> 50:46.065
"THE WAY YOU GLORIFY INFIDELITY

50:46.067 --> 50:49.534
IS WHY CONGRESS BANNED
ADVERTISING CIGARETTES ON TV.

50:49.536 --> 50:53.239
YOU ARE THE CANCER
OF DATING ADVICE."

50:53.241 --> 50:55.141
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOUR VOICE.

50:55.143 --> 50:57.143
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE HATE, MAN?

50:57.145 --> 50:58.543
HOW'D YOU EVEN FIND ME HERE?

50:58.545 --> 51:01.848
YOU GEOTAG EVERY POST.

51:01.850 --> 51:03.482
ARE YOU GONNA HURT ME?

51:03.484 --> 51:04.983
YOU'RE COMING ON MY SHOW.

51:04.985 --> 51:07.587
- WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
- MM-MM, WHY NOT?

51:13.393 --> 51:16.596
TOMORROW NIGHT.
NUMBER'S ON THERE.

51:16.598 --> 51:18.331
WHAT ARE WE GONNA TALK ABOUT?

51:18.333 --> 51:21.333
I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU SEEM
TO HAVE A LOT TO SAY.

51:21.335 --> 51:23.969
L.A. IS A MELTING POT
OF BROKEN EGOS

51:23.971 --> 51:25.337
DRIPPING WITH INSECURITY,

51:25.339 --> 51:27.273
ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR THE NEXT TRENDSETTER.

51:27.275 --> 51:29.241
IT'S THE EPICENTER
OF ENTERTAINMENT

51:29.243 --> 51:31.043
SENDING AFTERSHOCKS
OF CULTURE

51:31.045 --> 51:32.411
THROUGHOUT
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

51:32.413 --> 51:34.913
BUT IT'S THE VERY LACK
OF AN IDENTITY

51:34.915 --> 51:37.016
THAT GIVES IT SUCH
A UNIQUE PERSONALITY.

51:37.018 --> 51:39.886
IT TRULY IS A CITY
WHERE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE,

51:39.888 --> 51:42.654
AND SELF-DISCOVERY
IS UNDENIABLY CELEBRATED.

51:42.656 --> 51:45.358
AND OF COURSE,
THE MEXICAN FOOD

51:45.360 --> 51:49.527
IS DAMN NEAR PERFECT.

51:49.529 --> 51:53.232
- IT'S A BIT DARK.
- COME ON!

51:53.234 --> 51:54.933
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT,
YOU KNOW?

51:54.935 --> 51:57.503
LIKE, THE REASON I HATE IT
HERE IS THE SAME REASON

51:57.505 --> 51:59.905
- I LOVE IT HERE.
- NO, I UNDERSTAND.

51:59.907 --> 52:02.208
YOU UNDERSTAND BUT YOU HATE IT.
YOU HATE IT.

52:02.210 --> 52:04.376
LOOK, I THINK YOU'RE
A FANTASTIC WRITER.

52:04.378 --> 52:08.380
YOU'RE ARTICULATE,
YOU'RE FUNNY, YOU'RE ELOQUENT.

52:08.382 --> 52:11.583
IT'S JUST... MOST PEOPLE
WHO READ A TRAVEL BLOG

52:11.585 --> 52:13.585
DON'T WANT TO HEAR A PHILOSOPHICAL
ANALYSIS OF THE CULTURE.

52:13.587 --> 52:15.487
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE NICHE.

52:15.489 --> 52:17.956
THEY WANNA KNOW THE QUICKEST WAY
TO GET TO THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN,

52:17.958 --> 52:20.558
WHERE TO BUY CHEAP COCKTAILS.

52:20.560 --> 52:22.295
HEY...

52:22.297 --> 52:24.297
NO, NO, NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

52:24.299 --> 52:26.232
THERE IS A REALLY GOOD CHANCE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL

52:26.234 --> 52:27.699
- I'M TALKING ABOUT.
- NO.

52:27.701 --> 52:29.701
I ONLY READ TRAVEL BLOGS
TO FIND THE NEAREST ALLEYWAY

52:29.703 --> 52:31.570
TO GET A HAND JOB.

52:31.572 --> 52:34.407
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- NO, NOT SINCE GRINDR.

52:34.409 --> 52:36.141
WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE GRINDR?

52:36.143 --> 52:37.175
CRAIGSLIST.

52:37.177 --> 52:39.512
OH, GROSS.

52:39.514 --> 52:44.083
ARE PEOPLE IN SYDNEY MORE OPEN
THAN THEY ARE IN THE STATES?

52:44.085 --> 52:46.152
NO, DEFINITELY NOT MORE
THAN L.A.

52:46.154 --> 52:48.253
HM.

52:48.255 --> 52:50.523
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
NEVER LEFT THE COUNTRY BEFORE?

52:50.525 --> 52:52.724
A TRAVEL WRITER WHO HASN'T
LEFT THE COUNTRY?

52:52.726 --> 52:55.728
YEAH, THE IRONY IS NOT
LOST ON ME, BELIEVE ME.

52:55.730 --> 52:58.096
- DUDE!
- IT'S HARD WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY, YOU KNOW?

52:58.098 --> 52:59.699
IT'S OKAY, YOU CAN ANSWER.

52:59.701 --> 53:00.601
YEAH.

53:03.705 --> 53:05.438
HEY, MAN.

53:05.440 --> 53:07.005
- GREGORY.
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

53:07.007 --> 53:09.175
UH, YOU FREE SATURDAY?

53:09.177 --> 53:11.309
UH, I THINK SO.
WHY?

53:11.311 --> 53:13.079
I'M THROWING A PARTY
FOR STEF'S 30TH,

53:13.081 --> 53:14.713
- YOU SHOULD COME.
- YEAH, YEAH, OKAY,

53:14.715 --> 53:16.681
- IF I'M NOT WORKING.
- ALSO, SHOT IN THE DARK,

53:16.683 --> 53:19.751
BUT DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW ANYBODY
WITH A BIG HOUSE AND A POOL?

53:19.753 --> 53:23.355
- UH, WHY?
- TO THROW THE SAID PARTY.

53:23.357 --> 53:26.358
I CAN ASK AROUND,
BUT NO GUARANTEES.

53:26.360 --> 53:27.625
HAVE IT HERE.

53:27.627 --> 53:29.228
I'M ALREADY HOSTING ONE
ON SATURDAY.

53:29.230 --> 53:30.695
WHO'S THAT?

53:30.697 --> 53:32.998
SOMEONE JUST OFFERING
THEIR HOUSE IN THE HILLS.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.599
- BE POLITE.
- WOW, SERIOUSLY?

53:34.601 --> 53:38.503
- IS IT NICE?
- UH, YEAH, IT'S PRETTY NICE.

53:38.505 --> 53:41.639
- THERE'S ONLY ONE CATCH.
- HERE.

53:41.641 --> 53:43.641
- YELLO.
- HELLO?

53:43.643 --> 53:46.145
SO THE ONLY CATCH IS
IT'S A CYNDI LAUPER-FEST.

53:46.147 --> 53:48.780
SPECIFICALLY CYNDI LAUPER?

53:48.782 --> 53:51.516
- I'LL ALLOW ANYTHING '80S.
- DONE.

53:51.518 --> 53:53.418
- THERE YOU, OKAY?
- WHO WAS THAT?

53:53.420 --> 53:55.186
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT!

53:55.188 --> 53:57.088
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS SOUND
LIKE YOU'RE UP TO SOMETHING?

53:57.090 --> 53:59.125
I'M NOT UP TO ANYTHING, OKAY?

53:59.127 --> 54:01.027
OH... YOU GUYS ARE HOOKING UP.

54:01.029 --> 54:05.398
- NO, ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING.
- GREGORY. GRE...

54:05.400 --> 54:07.099
WE LOCKED THE HOUSE.

54:07.101 --> 54:09.034
OH, MY GOD. DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD GET, LIKE, A DJ,

54:09.036 --> 54:12.070
OR SHOULD I JUST PLAY, LIKE,
MUSIC FROM MY IPOD?

54:12.072 --> 54:14.540
WHAT KIND OF PARTY IS IT?

54:14.542 --> 54:16.509
I DON'T KNOW, HE SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT CYNDI LAUPER.

54:16.511 --> 54:19.311
NO, I MEAN IS IT
MORE LIKE A LAID BACK

54:19.313 --> 54:21.146
CHILLING WITH FRIENDS VIBE?

54:21.148 --> 54:25.250
OR MORE OF A CRAZY,
LOUD, DANCE PARTY THING?

54:25.252 --> 54:27.786
I MEAN, IT DEPENDS ON
WHAT YOU CONSIDER LAID BACK.

54:27.788 --> 54:30.288
WHERE I'M FROM IT'S FIVE DEGREES
OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW.

54:30.290 --> 54:33.224
TO ME, EVERYTHING OUT HERE
IS LAID BACK.

54:33.226 --> 54:35.761
YOU'RE NOT MUCH
OF A PARTIER?

54:35.763 --> 54:38.563
NO, IT'S NOT THAT,
IT'S JUST, I'M NOT TOO KEEN

54:38.565 --> 54:41.266
ON THE IDEA OF, LIKE,
DRUNK FRAT GUYS

54:41.268 --> 54:43.735
JUMPING INTO POOLS AND DOING
LINES OF COCAINE, SO...

54:43.737 --> 54:45.471
WELL, MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO BE IN THEIR 30S.

54:45.473 --> 54:48.541
I DOUBT IT'S GONNA BE
SOME RAUCOUS ANIMAL HOUSE.

54:48.543 --> 54:51.610
- YOU GO.
- AS IN WITHOUT YOU? I CAN'T DO THAT.

54:51.612 --> 54:53.279
I JUST... I DON'T WANT TO
RUIN YOUR TIME

54:53.281 --> 54:54.746
AND IT'S REALLY NOT MY SCENE.

54:54.748 --> 54:57.416
NO, NO, I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
A GOOD TIME IF YOU DON'T GO.

54:57.418 --> 54:59.384
LOOK, WE'LL JUST STOP BY
FOR, LIKE, A DRINK

54:59.386 --> 55:01.487
AND THEN...
WE'LL STEP INTO THE POOL.

55:01.489 --> 55:04.757
I'LL EVEN HIRE A LIFEGUARD
SO PEOPLE DON'T JUMP IN.

55:04.759 --> 55:06.558
LOOK, IF IT WEREN'T
STEF'S BIRTHDAY

55:06.560 --> 55:08.393
THEN I WOULDN'T EVEN
WANT TO GO.

55:08.395 --> 55:10.161
I'D WANT TO STAY AT HOME
WITH YOU

55:10.163 --> 55:13.099
AND BAKE NÉSTLE TOLL HOUSE
CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES,

55:13.101 --> 55:15.733
WATCH A MOVIE,
AND CUDDLE UNDER A BLANKET.

55:15.735 --> 55:18.670
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST
THAT I PROMISED HER

55:18.672 --> 55:20.438
LIKE TWO WEEKS AGO
THAT I WOULD DO THIS

55:20.440 --> 55:22.574
AND I'VE ALREADY SPENT
SO MUCH TIME INVITING EVERYBODY.

55:22.576 --> 55:26.411
I CAN'T NOT GO, IT'D BE
MAD AWKWARD AT THIS POINT.

55:26.413 --> 55:29.248
SO YOU GUYS ARE, LIKE,
REALLY CLOSE, HUH?

55:29.250 --> 55:33.585
I MEAN, SHE'S THE ONLY FRIEND
I HAVE THAT LIKES TO GO OUT.

55:33.587 --> 55:36.521
WHERE DOES ALL THIS ENERGY
COME FROM?

55:36.523 --> 55:38.290
- THIS? THIS ENERGY?
- YEAH...

55:38.292 --> 55:40.625
- IS IT TOO MUCH?
- SOMETIMES.

55:40.627 --> 55:42.228
YOU SEE THIS NOSE?

55:42.230 --> 55:44.797
SEE HOW IT'S NOT NORMAL?

55:44.799 --> 55:47.565
- NO.
- WELL, WHEN I WAS SIX,

55:47.567 --> 55:50.335
I RAN FACE FIRST
INTO A BRICK FIREPLACE

55:50.337 --> 55:51.770
AFTER HAVING A PIXIE STICK.

55:51.772 --> 55:53.471
I WAS A VERY HYPERACTIVE CHILD.

55:53.473 --> 55:54.840
GOT IT.

55:54.842 --> 55:56.741
I'M HAPPY HE FOUND SOMEONE.

55:56.743 --> 55:58.543
ME TOO.

55:58.545 --> 56:01.313
THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR LIKE TWO WEEKS EVERY DAY.

56:01.315 --> 56:02.514
THEY'RE LIVING OUR FANTASY.

56:02.516 --> 56:04.782
HE DESERVES IT.

56:04.784 --> 56:06.585
I'M JUST HAPPY I HAVE YOU.

56:06.587 --> 56:08.253
THAT REMINDS ME, ACTUALLY,

56:08.255 --> 56:10.655
I DIDN'T GET YOUR FLIGHT
ITINERARY,

56:10.657 --> 56:12.291
SO I WAS WONDERING,
I DON'T KNOW,

56:12.293 --> 56:13.925
MAYBE IT WENT TO SPAM, OR...

56:13.927 --> 56:16.762
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU,
THERE'S BEEN A MINOR CHANGE.

56:16.764 --> 56:19.431
IN TIME?

56:19.433 --> 56:21.500
MORE LIKE DAY?

56:21.502 --> 56:23.802
ARE WE OKAY, SOPHIE?

56:23.804 --> 56:26.739
I ONLY ASK, I MEAN,
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE NEEDY OR ANYTHING,

56:26.741 --> 56:29.175
IT'S JUST THAT I HAVE
A TENDENCY TO OVERTHINK THINGS

56:29.177 --> 56:30.942
AND MAYBE THAT WAS A MOMENT
THAT I OVERTHOUGHT,

56:30.944 --> 56:34.413
AND I JUST... I DON'T
WANT TO SCARE YOU OFF.

56:34.415 --> 56:36.382
I REALLY...

56:36.384 --> 56:38.887
WAIT...

56:41.221 --> 56:44.290

AND HE GET DOWN
ON THIS 2013 RED BORDEAUX

57:47.922 --> 57:49.587
I BOUGHT FOR MY DATE
WITH RON,

57:49.589 --> 57:51.422
OR, IF HE'S A DICK,

57:51.424 --> 57:52.925
THEN HE GETS
THAT VINEGAR WINE SWILL.

57:52.927 --> 57:54.396
THE CHOICE IS HIS.

57:55.962 --> 57:57.529
WOW.

57:57.531 --> 58:00.032
I LIKE THE SWEATER, BY THE WAY.
VERY MR. ROGERS.

58:00.034 --> 58:01.467
MY GIRLFRIEND GAVE IT TO ME.

58:01.469 --> 58:04.003
CUTE. ALL RIGHT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

58:04.005 --> 58:07.373
I AM HERE
WITH @ABRAHAMROSEN,

58:07.375 --> 58:09.775
A FOODIE AND INTERNET TROLL.

58:09.777 --> 58:14.445
NOW, ABE, ON MY LAST POST,
YOU COMMENTED, AND I QUOTE,

58:14.447 --> 58:16.982
"YOUR FORAY INTO OPEN LOVE

58:16.984 --> 58:19.351
IS AS DOOMED AS
THE 'LOST' FINALE."

58:19.353 --> 58:23.454
NOW, I'M AN ADULT,
AND I CAN TAKE A JOKE,

58:23.456 --> 58:27.358
EVEN SOME CRITICISM,
BUT THIS IS JUST ONE OF SEVERAL,

58:27.360 --> 58:31.563
SEVERAL ATTACKS ON ME.

58:31.565 --> 58:33.331
YOU DON'T WANT TO ADMIT
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM?

58:33.333 --> 58:34.500
I HAVE A PROBLEM?

58:34.502 --> 58:36.000
I MEAN, MOST PEOPLE DO,

58:36.002 --> 58:37.603
YOU'RE JUST VERY PUBLIC
ABOUT IT.

58:37.605 --> 58:40.572
WHAT IS MY PROBLEM?

58:40.574 --> 58:41.940
YOU CAN'T COMMIT.

58:41.942 --> 58:43.808
INSTEAD OF WORKING ON THAT,

58:43.810 --> 58:46.779
YOU CAME UP WITH A VERY
EASY WAY TO JUSTIFY IT.

58:46.781 --> 58:50.648
DUDE, I NEVER SAID POLY
WAS FOR EVERYONE, OKAY?

58:50.650 --> 58:52.851
THE SAME WAY THAT YOU CAN LOVE
MORE THAN ONE BOOK,

58:52.853 --> 58:56.454
OR ONE MOVIE, I CAN LOVE
MORE THAN ONE PERSON.

58:56.456 --> 58:57.889
I MEAN, THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH YOUR SHOW RIGHT THERE.

58:57.891 --> 59:00.425
YOU JUST COMPARED LOVE
AND HUMAN CONNECTION

59:00.427 --> 59:01.860
TO FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT.

59:01.862 --> 59:03.895
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT HUMAN CONNECTION?

59:03.897 --> 59:05.663
YOU HIDE BEHIND YOUR COMPUTER.

59:05.665 --> 59:07.599
YOU'RE THE ONE WITH AN AUDIENCE

59:07.601 --> 59:11.737
AND YOU MAKE INFIDELITY SOUND
LIKE A NATURAL, NORMAL THING.

59:11.739 --> 59:13.938
GUESS WHAT, BUDDY?
YOUR LAST COMMENT

59:13.940 --> 59:17.576
GOT OVER 800 LIKES,
SO LIKE IT OR NOT,

59:17.578 --> 59:20.681
YOU ALSO HAVE AN AUDIENCE.

59:23.683 --> 59:27.353
LOOK, INFIDELITY IS WRONG.

59:27.355 --> 59:29.688
WE CAN BOTH AGREE ON THAT,
RIGHT?

59:29.690 --> 59:33.425
BUT CHEATING ON SOMEONE
AND LOVING MULTIPLE PARTNERS

59:33.427 --> 59:35.460
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

59:35.462 --> 59:37.596
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST
NOT SPREADING YOUR LOVE THIN?

59:37.598 --> 59:41.699
HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN
MEASURE LOVE?

59:41.701 --> 59:45.406
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE FINALLY
PENETRATING EACH OTHER.

59:55.583 --> 59:58.817
SORRY! I'M SORRY.
IT'S STILL LOCKED?

59:58.819 --> 01:00:02.387
NO, I'VE BEEN VOLUNTARILY
SITTING OUTSIDE FOR TWO HOURS.

01:00:02.389 --> 01:00:04.723
OKAY, I APOLOGIZE.
I'M GONNA GET A KEY MADE FOR YOU

01:00:04.725 --> 01:00:07.092
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING,
OKAY?

01:00:10.598 --> 01:00:12.096
- HELLO.
- EMMA.

01:00:12.098 --> 01:00:13.398
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.967
HAVE YOU LEFT YET?

01:00:14.969 --> 01:00:18.404
UH, NO, I ACTUALLY HAD
A WORK EMERGENCY, SO...

01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:20.973
OH, NO, UM,
CAN I ASK YOU A FAVOR?

01:00:20.975 --> 01:00:22.741
OKAY.

01:00:22.743 --> 01:00:24.076
IF YOU CAN'T DO IT,
NO WORRIES,

01:00:24.078 --> 01:00:25.610
I'LL ASK SOMEBODY ELSE,
NOT A BIG DEAL.

01:00:25.612 --> 01:00:27.579
JUST LET ME KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

01:00:27.581 --> 01:00:30.983
- WHAT?
- YEAH, THERE SHOULD BE SOME IN THE KITCHEN.

01:00:30.985 --> 01:00:32.483
HELP YOURSELF.

01:00:32.485 --> 01:00:35.119
- YOU GOT A...
- UH, WE SHOULD HAVE ONE.

01:00:35.121 --> 01:00:37.723
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL FIND IT.
I'LL BRING IT TO YOUR ROOM.

01:00:37.725 --> 01:00:41.159
- SORRY...
- OH, I'M GONNA HAVE SOME GUESTS, ONE OR TWO,

01:00:41.161 --> 01:00:44.429
- IF THAT'S OKAY.
- THAT'S ACTUALLY 10 EXTRA DOLLARS

01:00:44.431 --> 01:00:46.165
- FOR EXTRA GUESTS, SORRY.
- OH, YEAH, SURE, SURE, SURE, YEAH,

01:00:46.167 --> 01:00:47.433
LET'S SEE, UH...

01:00:47.435 --> 01:00:48.634
- REALLY? REALLY?
- YOU LOVE IT.

01:00:48.636 --> 01:00:49.668
YEAH, YEAH, I LOVE IT.

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:52.637
HI, UH, SORRY, SORRY.

01:00:52.639 --> 01:00:53.971
WHAT'S UP?

01:00:53.973 --> 01:00:56.175
SO, APPARENTLY,
THE PIÑATA THAT I ORDERED

01:00:56.177 --> 01:00:57.875
HAS A MASSIVE CRACK IN IT

01:00:57.877 --> 01:01:00.913
AND UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION,
ALL THE CANDY INSIDE

01:01:00.915 --> 01:01:04.148
IS NUT-BASED, WHICH STEF
IS DEFINITELY ALLERGIC TO

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:05.784
SO I ORDERED A LAST-MINUTE
ONE FROM THE STORE.

01:01:05.786 --> 01:01:07.786
I JUST NEED SOMEBODY
TO PICK IT UP.

01:01:07.788 --> 01:01:11.456
- YEAH, I CAN DO THAT.
- AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

01:01:11.458 --> 01:01:13.090
IT'S ACROSS THE STREET
FROM YOUR HOUSE IN HOLLYWOOD

01:01:13.092 --> 01:01:14.793
- SO HOPEFULLY...
- YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW WHERE IT IS.

01:01:14.795 --> 01:01:17.529
I'M ACTUALLY THERE
RIGHT NOW, SO THAT WORKS.

01:01:17.531 --> 01:01:18.596
YOU'RE AMAZING, THANK YOU.

01:01:18.598 --> 01:01:19.898
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:22.570
LIKEWISE, I'LL, UH,
SEE YOU SOON.

01:01:25.038 --> 01:01:26.038
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
CHEATED ON?

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.773
BY?

01:01:27.775 --> 01:01:30.541
I ASSUME FROM YOUR UNINFORMED
AVERSION TO POLYAMORY

01:01:30.543 --> 01:01:32.580
THAT YOU'VE HAD A RUN IN
WITH INFIDELITY?

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:41.152
IF IT'S A PODCAST, YOU HAVE TO
ACTUALLY ANSWER INTO THE...

01:01:41.154 --> 01:01:43.621
YEAH, YEAH...

01:01:43.623 --> 01:01:46.123
I'M SORRY.
SO WHAT MADE YOU COME HERE?

01:01:46.125 --> 01:01:48.726
YOU MEAN BESIDES THE FACT
THAT YOU KIND OF STALKED ME?

01:01:48.728 --> 01:01:50.728
THAT'S THE INVESTIGATIVE
JOURNALIST IN ME,

01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:52.797
AND I'VE HAD ENOUGH
STALKERS OF MY OWN

01:01:52.799 --> 01:01:56.134
THAT I KNOW HOW TO REVERSE
ENGINEER THE WHOLE PROCESS.

01:01:57.804 --> 01:01:59.670
DID I JUST MAKE YOU LAUGH?

01:01:59.672 --> 01:02:05.677
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN,
I JUST MADE ABE ROSEN LAUGH!

01:02:05.679 --> 01:02:07.512
LOOK, I KNOW YOU WERE
JUDGING ME BEFORE

01:02:07.514 --> 01:02:10.581
BY THE INFORMATION
THAT I CHOOSE TO PUT OUT THERE

01:02:10.583 --> 01:02:14.585
TO MY LISTENERS,
AND YOU WANTED TO...

01:02:14.587 --> 01:02:16.255
DRIVE A SPEAR THROUGH
MY SKULL.

01:02:16.257 --> 01:02:18.590
BUT, NOW THAT WE'VE MET,

01:02:18.592 --> 01:02:21.527
AM I REALLY THE ANTICHRIST
THAT YOU ENVISIONED?

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:22.927
YOU WOULD MAKE THIS ABOUT YOU.

01:02:22.929 --> 01:02:25.264
- BITCH, IT'S MY PODCAST.
- FAIR ENOUGH.

01:02:25.266 --> 01:02:28.300
LOOK, THIS IS ALL ABOUT
A CHANGE IN PERSPECTIVE.

01:02:28.302 --> 01:02:29.934
AT LEAST YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT.

01:02:29.936 --> 01:02:32.804
THERE'S NOTHING SEXIER
THAN A CONFIDENT MAN

01:02:32.806 --> 01:02:34.239
THAT KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS.

01:02:34.241 --> 01:02:36.741
I KNOW I DON'T WANT
THIS SWEATER ANYMORE.

01:02:36.743 --> 01:02:39.710
IT IS GROSS.

01:02:39.712 --> 01:02:41.248
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCREW IT.

01:02:44.752 --> 01:02:48.223
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
ABE IS DISROBING?

01:02:51.859 --> 01:02:54.127
- FEEL BETTER?
- I DO.

01:03:01.335 --> 01:03:03.668
HEY!

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:05.871
OH, COME ON, I'M LEAVING,
I'M LEAVING RIGHT THIS SECOND, I SWEAR.

01:03:05.873 --> 01:03:07.306
YOU'RE PARKED
IN A LOADING ZONE.

01:03:07.308 --> 01:03:09.574
WHAT, DO YOU WORK
ALL OF SILVERLAKE OR SOMETHING?

01:03:09.576 --> 01:03:11.275
WE HAVE A LOT OF OFFICERS
ON DUTY.

01:03:11.277 --> 01:03:13.945
LOOK, I WAS JUST GOING IN
TO PICK SOMETHING UP, OKAY?

01:03:13.947 --> 01:03:16.315
I'M GONNA LEAVE RIGHT
THIS SECOND, I SWEAR.

01:03:16.317 --> 01:03:18.951
COME ON. NOW IS JUST NOT
JUST A GOOD TIME FOR ME.

01:03:18.953 --> 01:03:21.052
I CAN BARELY AFFORD THE TICKET
YOU GAVE ME LAST TIME...

01:03:21.054 --> 01:03:23.721
OKAY, OKAY!

01:03:23.723 --> 01:03:25.090
REALLY?

01:03:25.092 --> 01:03:27.659
DO ME A FAVOR.
PUT YOURSELF IN MY POSITION.

01:03:27.661 --> 01:03:29.226
YOU'VE BEEN ON THIS JOB
20 YEARS.

01:03:29.228 --> 01:03:31.063
PEOPLE ALWAYS CURSING
IN YOUR FACE,

01:03:31.065 --> 01:03:32.764
THREATENING THE SAFETY
OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

01:03:32.766 --> 01:03:35.366
DO YOU THINK THAT PRIMES
YOUR MOOD TO GIVE OUT FAVORS?

01:03:35.368 --> 01:03:37.369
NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

01:03:37.371 --> 01:03:40.005
THEN HOPEFULLY NEXT TIME YOU
WON'T THINK OF ME AND MY PEOPLE

01:03:40.007 --> 01:03:42.007
AS SOME SORT OF
ARCHETYPAL MONSTER.

01:03:42.009 --> 01:03:44.241
I AM A WELL-SPOKEN MAN.
I HAVE FEELINGS

01:03:44.243 --> 01:03:46.078
AND A SENSE OF HUMOR.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.614
YES, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
UNDERSTANDING, SERIOUSLY.

01:03:49.616 --> 01:03:50.849
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN HERE
SIX MINUTES

01:03:50.851 --> 01:03:52.650
SO I HAVE TO GIVE YOU
THIS TICKET.

01:03:52.652 --> 01:03:55.152
WHAT? I WAS STANDING HERE
TALKING TO YOU, YOU PSYCHO!

01:03:55.154 --> 01:03:56.621
ARE YOU
FREAKING SERIOUS?

01:03:56.623 --> 01:03:58.357
NO WONDER PEOPLE
THREATEN YOUR FAMILY.

01:03:58.359 --> 01:04:02.027
I'M JOKING. I WAS DEMONSTRATING
MY SENSE OF HUMOR.

01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:05.600
OH...
I'LL MOVE.

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:09.770
GOD, I HATE THAT LITTLE BITCH.

01:04:17.744 --> 01:04:22.047
♪ TURN IT UP,
SO EVERYBODY KNOWS ♪

01:04:22.049 --> 01:04:23.915
♪ THAT I GOT THE GOOD THING ♪

01:04:23.917 --> 01:04:25.317
♪ I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT GOES ♪

01:04:25.319 --> 01:04:28.286
SERIOUSLY, I AM OFF
OF ALKALINE WATER.

01:04:28.288 --> 01:04:30.422
I HAD A BAD TRIP LAST TIME
I DRANK IT.

01:04:30.424 --> 01:04:31.956
HOW DO YOU REGULATE
YOUR PH?

01:04:31.958 --> 01:04:32.958
I'VE TOTALLY
DONE WITHOUT CAFFEINE,

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.726
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

01:04:34.728 --> 01:04:36.228
MY GRASS-FED BUTTER COFFEE
REGIMEN, OF COURSE.

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:37.728
- OF COURSE.
- NATURALLY.

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:39.730
SOMETIMES, THEY ADD
AN EXTRA SYLLABLE.

01:04:39.732 --> 01:04:43.402
LIKE, INSTEAD OF "GIRL,"
THEY'D SAY "GETAL."

01:04:43.404 --> 01:04:45.404
INSTEAD OF "PEARL,"
THEY SAY "PETAL."

01:04:45.406 --> 01:04:47.905
"I GAVE THE GETAL A PETAL."

01:04:47.907 --> 01:04:50.976
- WHAT ABOUT JAPANESE?
- OOH, BRO, IT'S HARD TO DO AN ASIAN ACCENT

01:04:50.978 --> 01:04:52.411
WITHOUT COMING OFF
AS A RACIST.

01:04:52.413 --> 01:04:53.945
YEAH, PLEASE DON'T DO IT.
DON'T DO IT.

01:04:53.947 --> 01:04:56.380
I MEAN, BRITISH, OKAY.
ENGLISH, GREAT.

01:04:56.382 --> 01:04:59.284
I COULD EVEN DO A YIDDISH RABBI.

01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:02.087
JAPANESE, I'M A BIGOT.

01:05:02.089 --> 01:05:03.721
THIS IS GREAT PARTY.

01:05:03.723 --> 01:05:06.157
FULL OF LOTS OF STRAIGHT
WHITE PEOPLE.

01:05:06.159 --> 01:05:07.958
- OH, NO! NO...
- I FEEL LIKE I JUST MISSED THE SHOW.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.293
- HI.
- PERFECT TIMING.

01:05:09.295 --> 01:05:10.996
NO, HE'S MAKING AN ASS
OUT OF HIMSELF.

01:05:10.998 --> 01:05:12.931
EVERYBODY, THE BIRTHDAY GIRL
HAS "ARRIVEN."

01:05:12.933 --> 01:05:15.099
HEY! BIRTHDAY GIRL!
WELCOME!

01:05:15.101 --> 01:05:16.934
- THANK YOU!
- TELL HER HOW YOUNG SHE LOOKS

01:05:16.936 --> 01:05:18.804
AND FIND HER A CUTE GUY
TO TALK TO.

01:05:18.806 --> 01:05:19.804
DOES HE HAVE TO BE STRAIGHT?

01:05:19.806 --> 01:05:21.706
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

01:05:42.161 --> 01:05:44.362
- I AM SO SORRY!
- IT'S OKAY...

01:05:44.364 --> 01:05:47.101
- YOU WANT ME TO...
- NO, IT'S FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S OKAY.

01:05:54.273 --> 01:05:57.041
- GUESS WHO?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

01:05:57.043 --> 01:06:00.746
DANG, YOU'RE DOING WORK
IN THAT BODYSUIT.

01:06:00.748 --> 01:06:02.146
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:06:02.148 --> 01:06:04.282
YOU KNOW, JUST ANOTHER DAY
AT THE SALT MINES.

01:06:04.284 --> 01:06:05.349
BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,

01:06:05.351 --> 01:06:07.085
I MIGHT HAVE TO CLOCK OUT.

01:06:07.087 --> 01:06:10.355
HOLY SHIT, I JUST REALIZED
THIS IS AN '80S PARTY.

01:06:10.357 --> 01:06:14.860
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

01:06:14.862 --> 01:06:16.460
THAT'S... SOMETHING.

01:06:16.462 --> 01:06:20.065
YEAH. HEY, HOW CRAZY IS THAT
WE RAN INTO EACH OTHER HERE?

01:06:20.067 --> 01:06:21.366
I MEAN, WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?

01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:24.335
TOTALLY LIKE SERENITY,
YOU KNOW?

01:06:24.337 --> 01:06:25.337
YOU WANNA DO A SHOT?

01:06:25.339 --> 01:06:27.304
YEAH. YES, I DO.

01:06:27.306 --> 01:06:28.773
ALL RIGHT,
TELL ME WHAT IT IS.

01:06:28.775 --> 01:06:29.940
WELL,
HOPEFULLY SHE'S HERE SOON,

01:06:29.942 --> 01:06:31.208
I CALLED HER LIKE
AN HOUR AGO.

01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:33.177
- GIVE ME A HINT.
- ALL RIGHT,

01:06:33.179 --> 01:06:35.380
IT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE GONNA
WANT TO PUNCH

01:06:35.382 --> 01:06:37.349
AND IT'S MEXICAN.

01:06:37.351 --> 01:06:39.951
- GEORGE LOPEZ?
- YES!

01:06:39.953 --> 01:06:42.186
- UH, FLIP CUP.
- FLIP CUP?

01:06:44.223 --> 01:06:46.858
WHOA, YOU TAKE NO PRISONERS.

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:48.196
- HERE.
- OKAY.

01:07:01.975 --> 01:07:04.509
HEY. I HAVE SOME OF THAT
BLUE SHIT IN MY BACKPACK IF...

01:07:04.511 --> 01:07:06.177
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO BE
CONDESCENDING,

01:07:06.179 --> 01:07:08.579
BUT THAT BLUE SHIT
IS ACTUALLY BLUE CURACAO,

01:07:08.581 --> 01:07:10.982
WHICH IS NOT A LIQUOR,
IT'S A LIQUEUR

01:07:10.984 --> 01:07:12.284
WHICH IS DIFFERENT.

01:07:12.286 --> 01:07:13.884
LIQUOR AND LIQUEUR
ARE NOT THE SAME THING.

01:07:13.886 --> 01:07:15.587
OKAY, WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,

01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:17.588
IT DEFINITELY MAKES ME FEEL
ADEQUATELY INTOXICATED.

01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:19.291
YEAH, I LIKE YOU
FOR SEEING IT THAT WAY.

01:07:19.293 --> 01:07:20.391
COME ON, LET'S GO OUTSIDE.

01:07:20.393 --> 01:07:22.828
COME ON, GIRL. COME ON,

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:24.161
MAKE ME PROUD.
COME ON, GIRL.

01:07:24.163 --> 01:07:26.297
- OH!
- OH! WHAT!

01:07:26.299 --> 01:07:27.398
OH, MY GOD!

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.766
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE,

01:07:28.768 --> 01:07:30.902
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST GONNA START
GOING UP TO RANDOS AND JUST LIKE...

01:07:30.904 --> 01:07:33.505
EMMA! HEY! HEY.

01:07:33.507 --> 01:07:36.041
OH, MY GOD, ADAM.

01:07:36.043 --> 01:07:37.108
UM, I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO CALL YOU.

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:38.108
HOW LONG YOU BEEN HERE?

01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:39.344
OH, WERE YOU REALLY?

01:07:39.346 --> 01:07:40.411
YEAH, RECEPTION'S TERRIBLE
THOUGH.

01:07:40.413 --> 01:07:42.179
UM, DID YOU GET
THE PIÑATA?

01:07:42.181 --> 01:07:44.382
YEAH, IT'S OVER THERE
BLEEDING TWIZZLERS ON THE FLOOR.

01:07:44.384 --> 01:07:46.317
WHAT?

01:07:46.319 --> 01:07:48.587
YEAH, I SAW IT. ONE OF MY
CLIENTS KIND OF KARATE-CHOPPED IT

01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:49.954
WITH HIS KNEE.

01:07:49.956 --> 01:07:52.958
OH.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.059
PSH, YEAH, SO GOOD.

01:07:55.061 --> 01:07:56.561
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST
OUT RUNNING ERRANDS FOR YOU

01:07:56.563 --> 01:07:58.230
AND IT'S NICE
THAT WHEN I WALK IN,

01:07:58.232 --> 01:08:00.431
I SEE THE TWO OF YOU
JUST LAUGHING YOUR ASSES OFF

01:08:00.433 --> 01:08:02.099
- HAVING A GREAT TIME.
- "THE TWO OF" WHO?

01:08:02.101 --> 01:08:03.500
I HARDLY KNOW ANYBODY HERE.

01:08:03.502 --> 01:08:06.237
OH, COME ON ADAM.
ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?

01:08:06.239 --> 01:08:08.540
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE
UNTIL JUST NOW.

01:08:08.542 --> 01:08:10.007
AND I WOULD HAVE HELPED
WITH THE PIÑATA,

01:08:10.009 --> 01:08:11.275
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

01:08:11.277 --> 01:08:12.344
I WAS OUT GETTING
THE PERFECT PIÑATA

01:08:12.346 --> 01:08:14.045
FOR YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
WHO YOU JUST HAD TO THROW

01:08:14.047 --> 01:08:15.246
THIS HUGE PARTY FOR

01:08:15.248 --> 01:08:17.082
AND YOU JUST HAD TO TELL ME
TO COME

01:08:17.084 --> 01:08:18.617
EVEN THOUGH I TOLD POINT-BLANK
THAT I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE.

01:08:18.618 --> 01:08:19.984
ALL RIGHT, EMMA...

01:08:19.986 --> 01:08:22.386
NO! WOULD YOU JUST SCREW HER ALREADY
AND GET IT OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM?

01:08:22.388 --> 01:08:24.921
OKAY, 'CAUSE I CAN FEEL IT IN MY
BONES THAT YOU WANT HER, OKAY?

01:08:24.924 --> 01:08:27.091
AND I CAN'T STAND DATING YOU AND,
LIKE, LIVING WITH THIS SEED OF FEAR

01:08:27.093 --> 01:08:28.658
WONDERING WHEN IS IT GONNA
HAPPEN? WHEN IS IT GONNA...

01:08:28.661 --> 01:08:30.295
HEY, IS MY SURPRISE
HERE YET?

01:08:30.296 --> 01:08:31.997
CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE
IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION?

01:08:31.999 --> 01:08:33.398
BOTH OF YOU, PLEASE JUST
CALM DOWN FOR A SECOND.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:34.868
TELL YOUR FRIEND
TO TAKE A XANAX.

01:08:35.368 --> 01:08:36.533
OH!

01:08:40.374 --> 01:08:44.109
- OW!
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

01:08:44.111 --> 01:08:47.014
♪ YOU COULD HAVE IT ALL,
YOU COULD HAVE IT ALL ♪

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.167
AH, SHE'S AN ABSOLUTE PSYCHO.

01:09:10.169 --> 01:09:12.470
EVEN AT THE FILM SHOOT
I GOT BAD VIBES.

01:09:12.471 --> 01:09:13.604
RIGHT WHEN I HANDED YOU
THE LAMP,

01:09:13.606 --> 01:09:15.238
SHE GOT ALL COLD
AND DEFENSIVE.

01:09:15.241 --> 01:09:16.439
I DIDN'T PICK UP
ON ANY OF THAT.

01:09:16.442 --> 01:09:18.376
HERE, HOLD THIS TO YOUR NOSE.

01:09:18.377 --> 01:09:20.944
IT'S A BEER
AND AN ICE PACK IN ONE.

01:09:20.947 --> 01:09:23.180
DRINK THE BEER,
HOLD IT TO YOUR NOSE.

01:09:23.182 --> 01:09:26.484
BEER, NOSE, BEER, NOSE.

01:09:26.486 --> 01:09:28.286
BEER, NOSE.

01:09:28.287 --> 01:09:29.621
ARE YOU CALLING HER?

01:09:29.622 --> 01:09:31.354
- SHOULD I NOT CALL?
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

01:09:31.357 --> 01:09:33.658
- YOU GOTTA KEEP YOUR HEAD BACK.
- I AM.

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:35.393
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF IT FEELS ALL CROOKED,

01:09:35.395 --> 01:09:37.493
YOU GOTTA FIND YOURSELF
A REALLY GOOD RHINOPLASTER.

01:09:37.496 --> 01:09:39.095
I'M NOT GONNA NEED
A NOSE JOB.

01:09:39.098 --> 01:09:40.698
HONESTLY, IT DOESN'T EVEN
HURT THAT BAD.

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.602
I'M JUST BEING
KIND OF DRAMATIC.

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:56.081
HEY, THIS IS ADAM HART.
SO SORRY I MISSED YOU.

01:09:56.083 --> 01:09:57.482
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE
AND I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

01:09:57.484 --> 01:09:59.253
THANKS.

01:10:27.246 --> 01:10:28.613
WAKEY, WAKEY.

01:10:28.615 --> 01:10:30.448
- JESUS CHRIST.
- GOT YOU SOME BREKKIE, MATE.

01:10:30.450 --> 01:10:32.417
MAN, COME ON.

01:10:32.419 --> 01:10:35.319
I HAVE SOME FRUIT,
SOME COFFEE,

01:10:35.321 --> 01:10:37.588
AND A QUARTER OF
A CHOCOLATE DONUT.

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:39.323
I WANNA GO BACK TO SLEEP.

01:10:39.325 --> 01:10:41.559
BUT IT'S MY LAST DAY.

01:10:41.561 --> 01:10:43.094
WHAT?

01:10:43.096 --> 01:10:45.796
YEAH, I GOT A JOB
ON A SHOW IN BRITAIN,

01:10:45.798 --> 01:10:47.465
JUST FOR A COUPLE
OF WEEKS.

01:10:47.467 --> 01:10:49.570
OKAY.

01:10:50.803 --> 01:10:53.037
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.

01:10:53.039 --> 01:10:58.176
IT WAS A DRUNKEN DECISION,
BUT I USED A PORTION

01:10:58.178 --> 01:11:00.381
OF MY SKY MILES AND I BOUGHT YOU
A TICKET TO COME WITH ME.

01:11:02.481 --> 01:11:05.516
- WHAT?
- YOU'VE NEVER LEFT THE COUNTRY, MATE.

01:11:05.518 --> 01:11:07.351
I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

01:11:07.353 --> 01:11:09.787
AND, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO USE THEM,

01:11:09.789 --> 01:11:11.424
I'LL JUST PAWN THEM.

01:11:19.331 --> 01:11:20.331
GAY!

01:11:20.333 --> 01:11:22.699
GAY!

01:11:22.701 --> 01:11:24.668
YOU WANT MY ROBE
ON OR OFF?

01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:27.704
UM... WHATEVER'S MORE
COMFORTABLE FOR YOU.

01:11:27.706 --> 01:11:30.011
I JUST DON'T WANT MY TITS
HANGING OUT.

01:11:31.578 --> 01:11:32.577
I DON'T WANT THAT EITHER.

01:11:32.579 --> 01:11:34.179
- HEY, MAN.
- HEY.

01:11:34.181 --> 01:11:35.779
SOPHIE AND I ARE DOING
AN ESCAPE ROOM TODAY,

01:11:35.781 --> 01:11:37.348
YOU INTERESTED?

01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:39.583
- EH...
- IT'LL BE REALLY FUN.

01:11:39.585 --> 01:11:41.318
THEY LOCK YOU IN
A SMALL ROOM

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.287
AND YOU CAN'T LEAVE
UNTIL YOU SOLVE THE PUZZLES.

01:11:43.289 --> 01:11:44.788
- I'M OKAY.
- YOU SURE?

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:46.224
I'LL GET YOU AN ICE CREAM CONE.

01:11:46.226 --> 01:11:50.795
- THAT'S VERY SWEET.
- GOOD ONE.

01:11:50.797 --> 01:11:52.497
HEY, YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOULDN'T SIT THERE TOO LONG.

01:11:52.499 --> 01:11:55.600
IT'S NOT HEALTHY.
JUST GET UP, DO SOMETHING.

01:11:55.602 --> 01:11:57.605
- NO, I WILL.
- YEAH?

01:12:15.888 --> 01:12:17.322
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.
- I'M SORRY.

01:12:17.324 --> 01:12:18.225
SORRY.

01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:24.295
THAT'S WHY YOU SUCK AT LOVE.

01:12:24.297 --> 01:12:25.529
NAH, I'M KIDDING, IT WAS ME.

01:12:25.531 --> 01:12:27.198
DID YOU THINK IT WAS THE DOG?

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.765
OH, MAN, THANK GOD
YOUR LOVE LIFE SUCKS.

01:12:28.767 --> 01:12:30.201
OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE,

01:12:30.203 --> 01:12:32.237
BOOSTING MY VIEWERSHIP
AND PERPETUATING

01:12:32.239 --> 01:12:33.837
MY DEPENDENCY ON YOUR APPROVAL

01:12:33.839 --> 01:12:36.140
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN
SOME SEMBLANCE OF AN EGO.

01:12:36.142 --> 01:12:37.509
I NEED THIS.

01:12:37.511 --> 01:12:39.743
I AM GONNA TELL YOU
WHY YOU SUCK AT LOVE.

01:12:39.745 --> 01:12:41.645
AFTER ALL, I'M AN EXPERT.

01:12:41.647 --> 01:12:44.215
FIRST OF ALL, STOP COMPLAINING
ABOUT HOW HARD DATING IS

01:12:44.217 --> 01:12:46.350
FOR YOUR GENERATION.
IT'S HARD FOR EVERYBODY, ALL RIGHT?

01:12:46.352 --> 01:12:48.720
IF YOU'VE GOT ONE MORE NEGATIVE
THING TO SAY ABOUT MILLENNIALS,

01:12:48.722 --> 01:12:50.555
THEN GO BITCH ABOUT IT
IN THE COMMENTS SECTION

01:12:50.557 --> 01:12:52.357
SO EVERY OTHER PRIVILEGED
ASSHOLE CAN GET

01:12:52.359 --> 01:12:53.891
THE SAME SATISFACTION
THAT I'M GETTING RIGHT NOW.

01:12:53.893 --> 01:12:55.592
EVERY TIME YOU CRASH AND BURN,

01:12:55.594 --> 01:12:58.229
IT PUTS YOU ONE STEP
CLOSER TO CONVINCING YOURSELF

01:12:58.231 --> 01:12:59.530
THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH THE WORLD,

01:12:59.532 --> 01:13:00.931
NOT A PROBLEM WITH YOU.

01:13:00.933 --> 01:13:02.766
OOH, I JUST WENT
SLAM POETRY ON YOU.

01:13:02.768 --> 01:13:04.935
NORMALLY I WEAR A BERET WHEN
I DROP TRUTH BOMBS LIKE THAT,

01:13:04.937 --> 01:13:06.270
BUT IT'S IN THE WASH.

01:13:06.272 --> 01:13:08.540
HELLO?

01:13:08.542 --> 01:13:09.707
"OH, THERE'S TOO MANY OPTIONS.

01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:11.275
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO FIND SOMEONE

01:13:11.277 --> 01:13:12.443
WHEN STATISTICALLY
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE SOMEONE

01:13:12.445 --> 01:13:14.311
BETTER FOR ME OUT THERE?

01:13:14.313 --> 01:13:15.813
TINDER'S SO SUPERFICIAL.
IT'S ALL BASED OFF OF LOOKS."

01:13:15.815 --> 01:13:17.515
OH, YOU'RE NOT A FAN
OF OPTIONS?

01:13:17.517 --> 01:13:18.882
WHY DON'T YOU GO TO IDAHO,
WHERE THE POPULATION

01:13:18.884 --> 01:13:21.185
IS HALF AS DENSE
AND A FOUR IS A TEN?

01:13:21.187 --> 01:13:23.720
WELL, THEN TURN THE WATER OFF.

01:13:23.722 --> 01:13:25.723
OKAY, I'LL BE THERE IN TEN.

01:13:25.725 --> 01:13:26.823
DATING HAS ALWAYS BEEN HARD,

01:13:26.825 --> 01:13:28.592
EXCEPT NOW WE LIVE IN A TIME

01:13:28.594 --> 01:13:29.793
WHERE THERE'S ALL THESE FANCY,
NEW-FANGLED GADGETS

01:13:29.795 --> 01:13:31.362
THAT MAKE FINDING
THE PERFECT MATE

01:13:31.364 --> 01:13:32.833
EASIER THAN BREATHING.

01:13:38.437 --> 01:13:40.305
COMMUNICATION IS KING.

01:13:40.307 --> 01:13:44.242
OR SHOULD I SAY COMMUNICATION
IS A NON-GENDER SPECIFIC,

01:13:44.244 --> 01:13:46.610
NON-BINARY... I DON'T KNOW
THE FULL TERMINOLOGY.

01:13:46.612 --> 01:13:48.412
JUST KNOW THAT
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

01:13:48.414 --> 01:13:50.715
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,
IT'S TOUGH FOR YOU

01:13:50.717 --> 01:13:52.449
TO TAKE THE INFORMATION
THAT'S IN HERE,

01:13:52.451 --> 01:13:53.784
AND TURKEY BASTE IT
INTO SOMEBODY ELSE'S BRAIN.

01:13:53.786 --> 01:13:55.485
NOWADAYS IT'S SO EASY
TO GHOST PEOPLE

01:13:55.487 --> 01:13:57.354
AND AVOID CONFRONTATION
ALTOGETHER.

01:13:57.356 --> 01:13:59.591
BUT MY ADVICE TO YOU
WOULD BE TO JUST STOP HIDING

01:13:59.593 --> 01:14:02.627
AND GO OUT AND HAVE
A CONVERSATION.

01:14:02.629 --> 01:14:05.596
WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING,
LOVE, CONNECTION.

01:14:05.598 --> 01:14:07.767
AND A LESSON ABOUT LIFE
THAT DOESN'T SOUND SO PREACHY.

01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:11.635
SO HEAR ME WHEN I SAY THIS:

01:14:11.637 --> 01:14:13.770
DATING IS MEANT
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

01:14:13.772 --> 01:14:15.907
SO BE THAT HAPPY PERSON
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE

01:14:15.909 --> 01:14:18.679
AND I PROMISE,
YOU'LL STOP SUCKING AT LOVE.

01:14:19.879 --> 01:14:21.378
BE GOOD TO EACH OTHER,

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:22.646
AND, UM...

01:14:22.648 --> 01:14:23.918
MAYBE WE CAN DO THIS AGAIN
SOMETIME.
