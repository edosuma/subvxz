00:14.200 --> 00:20.355
What happened to Palmer shouldn't have. He
got involved in something he shouldn't have.

00:20.440 --> 00:23.989
- You know who killed David?
- He works for me.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.513
You lied to me.

00:25.600 --> 00:29.878
This entire day has been one giant lie.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.918
- What you've done makes me sick!
- Martha, enough.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.560
I need you to swear to me

00:35.640 --> 00:38.757
that you will do as I ask...

00:38.840 --> 00:39.989
for the country.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.195
I hate you.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.951
The situation with Martha is taken care of.

00:44.040 --> 00:48.033
There are too many loose ends.
We cannot have her unravel everything.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.155
She won't.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.514
I have the recording.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.830
- Have you destroyed it?
- No, sir, I have not.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.037
You and I have been in this
from the beginning.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.509
Destroying that recording protects both of us.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.949
- I got O'Brian.
- Where is she?

01:02.040 --> 01:04.315
She's working out of Bill Buchanan's house.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.994
Did Chloe tell you why she
was helping Audrey Raines and Bauer?

01:07.080 --> 01:12.074
She thinks Jack is innocent.
That President Logan framed Bauer.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.996
This is Karen Hayes. Miles traced Chloe.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.594
You have less than seven minutes
to get Chloe out.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.911
- Karen, why are you warning us?
- Because I may have made a mistake earlier.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.310
Chloe, if they find you here,
you'll be arrested. You have to go now.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.753
Not yet.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.876
It's over, Christopher. Turn around.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.351
- Give me the recording.
- I don't have it.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.509
Where is it?

01:41.600 --> 01:44.910
Henderson doesn't have the recording.
There gustave been a hand-off.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.719
- Henderson rendezvoused with another car.
- Can you track the other car?

01:47.800 --> 01:52.396
We're tracking it. It headed back to Van Nuys.
Looks like the civilian side of the airfield.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.232
Pulled onto the tarmac.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.278
Whoever it bas got onto the plane.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.952
It is a chartered diplomatic flight.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.953
We'eve tried everything.
be can't delay the plane.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.398
OK, call me when you got 'em. Yeah.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.710
Are you out? The team's almost there.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.553
Chloe's packing the comm gear she needs.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.108
- Where is Jack?
- Van Nuys airport.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.556
- He stowed away on a flight that just took off.
- What? Why?

02:30.640 --> 02:33.552
He's trying to find a recording
that implicates Logan.

02:33.640 --> 02:37.872
- And someone on that flight has it?
- Yes. Chloe's been trying to find out who.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.393
Hang on. Yeah?

02:39.480 --> 02:43.155
Field team's a block away.
I'll set up here for the debrief of O'Brian.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.800
- No, put it in the situation room.
- I thought...

02:45.880 --> 02:49.316
I want it in the situation room. Go.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.072
The field team will be there any second.
Get Chloe out.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.957
- How close are they?
- One block.

02:59.040 --> 03:02.157
I'll run interference.
It's more important she gets away.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.755
I'll bring you in. You'll be treated
as a suspect. We never talked.

03:05.840 --> 03:09.037
- Understood. They're here. Out the back.
- Bill, wait.

03:09.120 --> 03:13.318
Have Chloe call me on a dry channel,
either one-five or two-seven.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.517
Dry channel one-five or two-seven. Got it.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.998
There's a gate in the back.
Follow the path to the alley.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.674
- Turn right.
- What about the curfew?

03:23.760 --> 03:26.991
There's a hotel.
You should make it without being spotted.

03:27.080 --> 03:31.153
- What about you?
- I'll be at CTU, probably in Holding.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.800
- Why Holding?
- Karen will place me under arrest.

03:33.880 --> 03:38.749
If you need anything, contact her.
Chloe, please, just go.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.077
- Who is it?
- Homeland Security.

03:57.160 --> 04:01.836
Mr Buchanan, we need you to open the door.
We're under order from Karen Hayes.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.115
I'll be right there.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.877
- What's going on?
- Step aside. We need to search the house.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.793
No, I'm not stepping aside.
Do you have a warrant?

04:16.880 --> 04:19.348
- Where's Chloe O'Brian?
- I have no idea.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.000
Don't make us use force.
We know she's been here.

04:22.079 --> 04:25.152
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Where is she?

04:25.240 --> 04:28.232
I don't know where Chloe O'Brian is.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.871
She's not here.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.398
Sir, this is a recent file from Comm.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.948
Only O'Brian could access it.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.876
Talk to us, sir.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.076
I'm not talking to you.
I'll talk to Karen Hayes.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.393
- Papazian.
- Mr Papazian, we are on site.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.517
It appears Chloe O'Brian bas here
but she has gone.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.160
- Is Bill Buchanan there?
- Yes, sir.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.992
- We lost O'Brian.
- Dammit.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.469
Put him on the phone, please.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.356
- Hello?
- Don't play games with me.

05:19.440 --> 05:22.989
Just give me O'Brian's location
or I will make it very bad for you.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.436
From what I understand,
she got out of CTU right under your nose.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.637
- You're the one who ought to be concerned.
- This is Hayes.

05:29.720 --> 05:33.838
Tell us what you know now.
Stop wasting our time.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.990
I'm not saying any more.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.508
- This is Ed.
- Ed, bring Buchanan in.

05:41.600 --> 05:46.151
Set up a search for Chloe. She's probably got
a car which means she's about 15 mites out.

05:46.240 --> 05:47.958
Copy that.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.952
But the agents on site
are trained for interrogation.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.554
- Why are you bringing him in?
- I hanna run this.

05:53.640 --> 05:58.794
- But now it's us who are wasting time.
- Don't worry. I will make him talk.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.394
I'll be in my office.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.078
Yeah.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.879
I'm at the Miramont.
Make sure no one looks here.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.793
I'll take care of that.
Tell me what else you need.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.077
Jack's on diplomatic flight 520.
Pull up the manifest.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.911
Got it. Flight 520 to Frankfurt.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.790
OK. Put everything you've got from that flight
onto the shared volume so I can get to it.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.800
- Done.
- OK. I see it.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.871
Thanks.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.273
Yeah.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.351
- Are you OK?
- Did you get it?

07:43.440 --> 07:46.273
I got the passenger list.
I'll cross it against Henderson.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.794
- What about the air marshal?
- In a minute.

07:48.880 --> 07:52.395
- What's happening at CTU?
- They're still under orders to stop you.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.630
- Karen Hayes is backing us.
- Openly?

07:54.720 --> 07:58.633
No, but she's letting me help you.
If there's proof against Logan she wants it.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.188
The proof is on this plane.
Check the manifest.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.955
Figure out who has a connection
to Henderson. Find the air marshal's seat.

08:10.480 --> 08:13.870
- We could grab some shuteye.
- I don't think so.

08:13.960 --> 08:18.750
Oh, hey. I was just asking.
You don't have to go all feminist on me.

08:18.840 --> 08:22.276
You see that? 21-st-century woman.

08:22.360 --> 08:25.238
We'd better get used to it.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.037
Yeah.

08:35.120 --> 08:38.794
I found the air marshal.
His name is George Avila. He's sitting in 7A.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.916
- Is anyone sitting next to him?
- No.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.073
Get back to me when you've got
the connection to Henderson.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.471
Excuse me.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.275
Excuse me. Is that seat taken?

09:41.640 --> 09:43.596
No.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.831
Thanks.
The stewardess said I could change seats.

09:46.920 --> 09:52.472
I was next to the galley. It's linda noisy.
I'm trying to get some rest.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.471
Yeah.

10:18.640 --> 10:22.428
The man you're looking for is in seat 12D.
His name is Hans Meyer.

10:22.520 --> 10:26.149
He's been connected to Omicron
since the mid-lggos.

10:26.240 --> 10:29.038
He's worked directly with Henderson.
That's it.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.111
OK, I've got it.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.234
- Mr Meyer.
- Yes?

10:46.320 --> 10:50.108
- My name's George Avila. I'm the air marshal.
- What's wrong?

10:50.200 --> 10:54.830
We found something we think is yours. It
shouldest been in the baggage compartment.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.959
We'd like you to come back to the galley
and identify it for us so we can stow it.

10:59.040 --> 11:02.953
Please, sir. We'd really appreciate it.

11:03.040 --> 11:06.635
- If you have any carry-on bags, bring them.
- I don't.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.439
Very well.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.753
- What makes you think it was mine?
- Ticket stub.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.678
They have taken away all my medication.
I need it.

12:00.760 --> 12:05.276
I'm sorry madam.
They won't let me give that to you.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.511
What do they think I'm donna do?
Kill myself?

12:08.600 --> 12:11.068
Over that son of a bitch?

12:13.120 --> 12:17.318
I just called the President of the United States
a son of a bitch. No reaction?

12:17.400 --> 12:22.599
He must have some kind of law on the books
against that. Or am I immune?

12:22.680 --> 12:24.875
Just like he is.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.914
Do you have a first name, Agent Adams?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.116
It's Justin, madam.

12:36.400 --> 12:40.791
You don't have much of a personality,
do you, Justin?

12:49.280 --> 12:51.430
This is Novick.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.592
I-it's Martha. Are you still on the retreat?

12:55.760 --> 13:01.869
- Yes. I'm just down the hall from your room.
- I need you to come here right away.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.155
I'll be right there.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.229
- They've cut me off from my medication.
- You haven't been cut off.

13:24.320 --> 13:28.836
Dr Hill said you had enough in your system
right now. You need to wait a few hours.

13:28.920 --> 13:33.596
I don't want to wait a few hours, Mike.
I need something now.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.399
- What's going on?
- I don't need counselling, Mike.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.948
I just want a damn pill.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.600
Sit down.

13:41.680 --> 13:45.116
Thank you, Agent. You are dismissed.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.994
We've, uh, been through
some tough times before, Martha.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.470
Just follow the doctor's orders for now.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.556
This is more than just a tough time.
None of this is donna go away.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.710
I just have to live with it.

14:02.800 --> 14:08.591
What do you mean, it's not going to go away?
What are you talking about?

14:10.160 --> 14:12.435
I shouldn't have said that.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.715
Martha.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.474
You say what needs to be said.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.592
What needs to be said I can't say to you.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.752
Why not?

14:29.240 --> 14:33.597
Listen, Mike, I just...
I just need to get some sleep.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.433
My nerves are shot from today.

14:38.520 --> 14:42.229
I just need something to calm me down.
I just need to get my medication.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.118
The president doesn't want you
to leave the room.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.156
Then you can bring it here.

14:48.280 --> 14:54.071
I just want to take a couple of pills.
I need to sleep. You can watch me take them.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.309
I'll see what I can do.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.632
- Yes?
- Have they found Bauer yet?

15:15.720 --> 15:18.712
- No, they haven't.
- That's not good.

15:18.800 --> 15:23.351
I know that's not good.
I'm putting pressure everywhere I can.

15:23.440 --> 15:28.230
I don't have to tell you how disastrous it'd be
if Bauer gets his hands on that recording.

15:28.320 --> 15:31.790
That's exactly right.
You don't have to tell me. I know.

15:31.880 --> 15:36.112
When I find him, I will call you.
Is there anything else?

15:36.200 --> 15:37.633
No.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.711
Good.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.991
Mr President.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.476
- What is it, Mike?
- Something I should call to your attention.

15:51.560 --> 15:52.549
Yes?

15:52.640 --> 15:55.996
Your wife is in a very agitated state.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.674
- I don't know how to proceed.
- Proceed with what?

15:58.760 --> 16:03.959
She wants me to bring her
her medication against doctor's orders.

16:04.040 --> 16:08.431
That's all I need right now, is to
deal with her. No, no! No more pills!

16:08.520 --> 16:11.512
And she shouldn't be wasting your time
with this anyway.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.591
Mr President.

16:15.440 --> 16:19.991
- Is there something I should know about?
- Why? What did she say?

16:20.560 --> 16:23.358
She needs more medication
to calm herself down.

16:23.440 --> 16:29.310
Something's clearly bothering her
but she didn't hanna talk about it.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.958
I don't see where any of this
becomes your business.

16:33.040 --> 16:37.318
I'll tell you where, Mr President.
I'm your Chief of Staff.

16:37.400 --> 16:42.758
If there's something going on that involves
national security, it is my business.

16:50.760 --> 16:55.311
This isn't national security, Mike.
It's our marriage.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.392
I think both of us realized today...

16:59.400 --> 17:02.233
that our relationship
is nothing more than a facade,

17:02.320 --> 17:05.630
and one that we'll have to keep up
for as long as I'm president.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.154
I think that...

17:08.240 --> 17:11.277
she's reacting to that, Mike.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.590
I see.

17:15.839 --> 17:18.229
- I'm sorry sir.
- Mike.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.635
Give her what she wants.

17:21.720 --> 17:24.393
Lord knows she's in a lot of pain.

17:37.160 --> 17:41.517
- Where are you hiding it?
- Hiding what? What the hell is this?

17:41.600 --> 17:44.512
I know who you are.
I know your connection with Omicron.

17:44.600 --> 17:48.752
Henderson asked you to take something
out of the country for him. Where is it?

17:48.840 --> 17:51.957
Henderson. I have not seen him in months.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.873
- Don't you lie to me.
- I am not lying, I swear.

17:54.960 --> 17:59.590
I know Henderson,
but I don't know what you're talking about.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.955
- Did you check your luggage?
- Yes.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.110
Find it. Move!

18:08.880 --> 18:11.678
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

18:12.120 --> 18:14.190
- Homework?
- Homework, yeah.

18:15.120 --> 18:18.351
I didn't know they had Wi-Fi in here.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.920
Could you leave me alone?
I can't talk right now.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.269
You're a little, uh, freaked out because
of the curfew thing. Join the club.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.078
Yeah, OK.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.152
When you come up for air, I'm buying.

18:41.160 --> 18:44.277
- Airport customs.
- This is Chloe O'Brian from CTU.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.590
I need to talk to Passenger Clearing.

18:46.680 --> 18:50.468
- I'll need your verification.
- Agency ID CTU99A-12.

18:51.840 --> 18:56.277
The captain turned on the "Fasten seat belt"
sign as we are expecting turbulence.

18:56.360 --> 19:01.480
Please return to your seat and make sure
your seat belt is securely fastened.

19:11.720 --> 19:16.316
The passenger in 12D must be in the lavatory.
Get him out. It's donna shake pretty hard.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.313
- There's nobody in those. I just checked.
- Then where is this guy?

19:20.400 --> 19:23.517
I don't know.
Maybe he changed seats.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.118
Call the captain. Tell him the air marshal's
down and a passenger's missing.

19:35.200 --> 19:39.876
- What's going on here?
- Please be seated, sir. Now, sir.

19:41.560 --> 19:45.189
- Yeah?
- The air marshal's been assaulted.

19:45.280 --> 19:48.511
What? Assaulted?
What's going on back there?

19:48.600 --> 19:51.398
He's been knocked out
and a passenger's missing.

19:51.480 --> 19:55.951
OK. OK. Secure the cabin.
Keep the passengers under control.

19:56.040 --> 19:59.077
- What's going on?
- There's a problem. Is our door secure?

19:59.160 --> 20:03.312
- It is. What kind of problem?
- The air marshal's been knocked out.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.632
Call LA Center.
Get vectors for an emergency return.

20:08.720 --> 20:13.350
- Mr Avila, what happened?
- The man seated next to me, where is he?

20:13.440 --> 20:16.910
- I didn't see him.
- We'e gotta find him. Dammit!

20:17.000 --> 20:20.117
- What?
- He's got my gun.

20:37.920 --> 20:39.911
Mike, come in.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.993
So, do you have something for me?

20:51.920 --> 20:57.278
- This is enough for a couple of days. Dr Hill...
- Thank you, Mike.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.639
I'll get ready for bed now.
Is there something else?

21:10.720 --> 21:12.711
Yes, there is.

21:14.520 --> 21:21.153
Earlier, you said something to the effect that
I didn't know everything that was going on.

21:21.240 --> 21:24.596
I was confused. I wanted my pills.

21:24.680 --> 21:28.958
- I don't think so.
- Are you calling me a liar?

21:29.640 --> 21:32.200
I just spoke with the president

21:32.280 --> 21:35.829
and I got the same feeling from him
that I get from you.

21:35.920 --> 21:39.117
- Which is?
- That you're both covering something up.

21:39.200 --> 21:43.591
You know, Mike, I'm the one around here
who's supposed to be paranoid, not you.

21:43.680 --> 21:46.319
I know you, Martha.

21:46.400 --> 21:51.918
And I know the president.
He said this is all about marital difficulties.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.833
I think there's something else.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.911
What is it?

21:59.560 --> 22:01.790
Don't shut me out.

22:01.880 --> 22:05.589
- Maybe I can help you.
- There is something else, Mike.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.989
It's between me and Charles.

22:08.080 --> 22:11.755
If that changes, I promise I'll let you know.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.037
I don't know what you think
Henderson gave me. I saw no one.

22:24.120 --> 22:27.715
I was picked up at the consulate
and brought directly here.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.633
Is this your only luggage?
If you're lying, I'll know.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.915
I am not lying. Please.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.754
If someone on this plane
has something you want, it is not me.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.831
Yeah.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.912
- Jack, I don't think Hans Meyer is our guy.
- Why not?

22:42.000 --> 22:47.711
The time line doesn't match.
He's been in customs for the last three hours.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.519
The plane's turning. They know I'm on board.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.068
- Chloe, keep looking.
- OK.

23:04.480 --> 23:08.029
- Are you sure he's down there?
- There's nowhere else he can be.

23:08.120 --> 23:12.989
- Tell the pilot he can do it.
- There's a passenger with him. He could die.

23:13.080 --> 23:16.914
There's over 50 passengers up here.
Call them now.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.070
Get it.

23:23.080 --> 23:27.835
Captain, the air marshal says
the baggage area is secure

23:28.320 --> 23:30.629
a-and that you should begin.

23:37.440 --> 23:40.273
- Air's coming in.
- It's not coming in. It's going out.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.954
- What?
- They're depressurising this area.

23:43.040 --> 23:47.875
- What's donna happen to us?
- If we don't get out we'll lose consciousness.

23:52.280 --> 23:55.431
Jack, what's going on?
The security net issued a bulletin.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.273
- Patch me through to the pilot.
- I don't know if I can.

23:58.360 --> 24:02.194
They're depressurising this area.
We're donna lose consciousness.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.910
Yeah, Chloe.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.437
Jack needs us to patch him into the pilot.
Can you get through on a CTU subchannel?

24:16.520 --> 24:19.990
- I'll try. Hold on.
- I'll stay on the line.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.510
- Air control officer 404.
- Yes.

24:24.600 --> 24:28.832
Patch me through to the pilot
of diplomatic flight 520 out of Van Nuys.

24:29.640 --> 24:34.077
Hey, what're you got?
A little voice-over IP going on there?

24:34.160 --> 24:37.436
- Please leave me alone.
- No, seriously, I can help.

24:37.520 --> 24:41.752
I know a way for you
to get some free bandwidth.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.637
- Really?
- Absolutely.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.678
- Sit down.
- Cool.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.039
Nice piece.

24:51.800 --> 24:55.076
I've never seen one of these before.
What is that?

24:56.920 --> 24:59.514
It's a CTU series four.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.433
Chloe, they've opened the line to the pilot.

25:02.520 --> 25:05.273
Thanks.
Jack, I'm putting you on with the pilot.

25:05.360 --> 25:07.351
Go ahead.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.799
This is Captain Stan Cotter.
Who am I speaking to?

25:10.880 --> 25:13.713
My name is Jack Bauer.
I'm with CTU in Los Angeles.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.473
- I'm in your baggage hold.
- What are you doing?

25:16.560 --> 25:20.155
I'll explain everything,
but you have to restore air pressure.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.356
Sir, I remind you I am a federal agent.

25:22.440 --> 25:26.069
What kind of a federal agent
knocks out an air marshal?

25:26.160 --> 25:30.039
I was patched through by CTU.
I couldn't have done that without clearance.

25:30.120 --> 25:33.317
Look, you have a gun
and you've breached airplane security.

25:33.400 --> 25:37.791
Captain, this is a matter of national security.
Now, open the damn hatch.

25:38.680 --> 25:42.070
He couldn't have patched in through CTU
if he was hostile.

25:42.160 --> 25:47.917
There's no point taking a chance. In a minute
he'll pass out. The air marshal can handle it.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.436
Captain,
we are running out of air down here.

25:51.520 --> 25:55.308
Captain, there is a man on board your plane
that is of danger to you.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.073
That's why I am here. Open the hatch.

26:02.640 --> 26:06.713
- I can 't do that.
- OK, you son of a bitch.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.389
Move forward.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.432
- What was that?
- Aileron conduit's been breached.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.670
- What?
- What do you think you're doing?

27:00.760 --> 27:04.514
- You'll kill everybody on this plane.
- That's up to you. Open the hatch.

27:04.600 --> 27:09.628
- I'm not letting you up here.
- Then you'll be responsible for everything.

27:16.080 --> 27:19.629
I'm donna stabilize the pressure
and let him up. Unlock the hatch.

27:19.720 --> 27:22.234
The cockpit's secure. He can't get in here.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.311
Yes, Captain.

27:27.280 --> 27:33.116
- Hey, what do you think you're doing?
- The captain ordered me to open the hatch.

27:34.480 --> 27:38.792
80th of you, turn around
and grab the wall. Now!

27:47.720 --> 27:49.915
You, in the baggage hold.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.271
Do it, now.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.151
Close it.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.431
Lock it.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.280
- Take me to the galley.
- Get back to your seats.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.828
- What's going on?
- Sit down!

28:17.920 --> 28:20.878
Stay in your seats.
Put your hands on your head.

28:20.960 --> 28:25.397
Do what I tell you and no one will get hurt.
If you don't, people will start to die.

28:25.480 --> 28:30.759
- Get the captain on the phone now.
- Sir, he's in the main cabin. He has a gun.

28:30.840 --> 28:35.470
- First class passengers to the main cabin.
- Everyone to the main cabin.

28:36.920 --> 28:40.390
This is Bauer. I have no intention
of hurting your passengers.

28:40.480 --> 28:44.439
- I need to find something that's on the plane.
- What do you want, Bauer?

28:44.520 --> 28:47.034
Remain in a holding pattern so I can search.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.237
If you're a federal agent
you know I have to land this plane.

28:50.320 --> 28:53.198
- That won't give me enough time.
- Not my problem.

28:53.280 --> 28:56.397
I have a gun. Your air marshal is down.
It is your problem.

28:56.480 --> 29:00.473
- You need to remain in a holding pattern.
- You do what you have to do, Bauer.

29:00.560 --> 29:05.315
My job is to land this airplane,
and that is what I am going to do.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.391
Captain! Captain!

29:27.920 --> 29:30.593
- That's all be have on flight 520, sin
- OK.

29:30.680 --> 29:34.958
Look, I want updates on the situation
on a minute-by-minute basis if necessary.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.031
Yes, sir.

29:45.320 --> 29:46.309
Yes?

29:46.400 --> 29:48.868
I just got word from the FAA
about a hijacking

29:48.960 --> 29:52.635
aboard a diplomatic flight
that left Van Nuys a half-hour ago.

29:52.720 --> 29:53.994
So what?

29:54.080 --> 29:58.278
- Jack Bauer is the hijacker.
- What is he doing on that flight?

29:58.360 --> 30:02.911
He's looking for the recording
that implicates me in David Palmer's death.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.551
Henderson handed it to somebody before he
was arrested. Jack must know it's on board.

30:07.640 --> 30:11.189
You shouldn't waste your time
talking to me. Order the plane down

30:11.280 --> 30:14.636
and grab Bauer before he can hurt us.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.473
What are you saying?
That he hijacked the plane?

30:22.560 --> 30:24.516
He has control of the cabin.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.319
- The pilot is landing the plane.
- The recording?

30:27.400 --> 30:30.756
There's no guarantee he'll find it
before the plane lands.

30:30.840 --> 30:35.630
After that it's all over. The president will have
his people arrest Jack at the airport.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.836
What are we supposed to do?

30:37.920 --> 30:41.913
Just keep helping Jack.
Chloe, I need to see that evidence.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.117
- Call me if you need anything from here.
- Fine.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.274
Give me a second.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.796
What's Bauer doing on flight 520?

30:56.880 --> 30:59.474
You have no idea, you little ass-kisser.

30:59.560 --> 31:03.599
You don't talk to my people like that, Bill.
Take him to Holding.

31:03.680 --> 31:06.240
It's no wonder CTU fell apart under that guy.

31:06.320 --> 31:12.236
Miles, I know you're trying to help,
but I'll take it from here, OK?

31:19.240 --> 31:22.835
- Western Operations.
- Miles Papazian, Homeland Security.

31:22.920 --> 31:25.878
Pass code 2166.
Put me through to Mike Novick.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.428
One moment, please.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.038
What is it?

31:31.560 --> 31:36.270
I need your input, sir, because
I'm having a problem with Karen Hayes.

31:36.360 --> 31:39.909
I'd like to preface what I'm about to tell you
by saying that I...

31:40.000 --> 31:43.913
I don't have time for prefaces.
Hayes was called in to replace Buchanan.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.516
- She was hand-chosen by the vice president.
- I understand that, sir.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.319
Are you saying you feel
she's unfit to do the job?

31:51.400 --> 31:55.279
Four hours ago she relieved Bill Buchanan
for ineffectual leadership.

31:55.800 --> 32:00.954
He's been working covertly with Chloe
O'Brian to aid Jack Bauer, a federal fugitive,

32:01.040 --> 32:03.952
which means he needs
to be dealt with appropriately.

32:04.040 --> 32:07.396
- What has Karen done?
- She sent in a tac team to pick them both up.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.789
By the time they got there
O'Brian was gone.

32:09.880 --> 32:13.998
But instead of having the team
do the interrogation of Buchanan on site,

32:14.080 --> 32:18.198
Karen wasted 20 minutes
by bringing him into CTU.

32:19.160 --> 32:23.438
Maybe she felt the interrogation
would be more effective with CTU resources.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.637
But sir, she isn't even using
rudimentary CTU resources.

32:26.720 --> 32:29.439
She wants to do a soft Q and A by herself.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.990
Any leads be may have had
on O'Brian have dried up.

32:33.080 --> 32:37.915
Wait a second, Miles. I'm not going to pass
judgement on Karen Hayes at this point.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.755
She's not interrogating a terrorist,
but a high-ranking federal employee.

32:42.840 --> 32:47.675
Sometimes finesse and diplomacy
are better than coercion.

32:47.760 --> 32:52.788
Your concern is duly noted, Miles. If you'll
excuse me, I need to see the president.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.076
- Karen...
- Shut up, Bill.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.154
We're offline. Now we can talk.

33:17.240 --> 33:21.358
Look, you can continue this charade
if you want to, but Jack needs our help.

33:21.440 --> 33:24.910
And he's getting it.
But I am still in charge of this facility

33:25.000 --> 33:29.755
and until I see that evidence,
I must remain sceptical.

33:29.840 --> 33:33.310
Have you talked to Chloe?
What's Jack's status?

33:33.400 --> 33:36.597
He's searching the cabin
but the pilot is going to land.

33:36.680 --> 33:38.989
- How much time does Jack have?
- 15 minutes.

33:39.080 --> 33:44.029
To search 50 passengers? That's impossible.

33:44.840 --> 33:45.829
Yes?

33:45.920 --> 33:51.278
The president and Mike Novick
want an update on the hijacking of flight 520.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.588
Put them through.

33:53.120 --> 33:57.910
- Go ahead, sin
- This is the president. Talk to me about 520.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.356
We know that Bauer's involved,
but we don't know why.

34:01.440 --> 34:06.309
Isn't it obvious? Bauer is a fugitive and he's
looking for safe passage out of the country.

34:06.400 --> 34:10.359
- That's certainly a possibility.
- Listen to me. This man is desperate.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.351
He will say or do anything.
He's not to be trusted.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.553
We need to take him down now, dead or alive.

34:18.080 --> 34:20.514
- Yes, sir.
- Mr President.

34:20.600 --> 34:25.230
Look. You call the pilot. You tell him that
I don't care if Bauer is making threats or not.

34:25.320 --> 34:28.869
That plane has to land immediately,
and when it lands,

34:28.960 --> 34:34.239
I want my Secret Service detail
to take him into custody. Is that clear?

34:34.320 --> 34:37.118
- Ms Hayes?
- Yes, Mr President.

34:41.360 --> 34:44.591
The president had knowledge
of everything that's happened.

34:44.679 --> 34:50.072
He wants that plane down before Jack finds
the evidence. We have to buy him more time.

34:50.159 --> 34:54.597
I don't have the authority
to keep that plane from landing.

34:55.400 --> 34:59.518
- Sir, this still doesn't make sense to me.
- What?

34:59.600 --> 35:04.071
Jack Bauer has been on the right side of
everything that's happened today until now.

35:04.160 --> 35:07.118
Well, right now he is hijacking a plane.

35:07.200 --> 35:10.351
This man is not stupid.
He's appeared to do the right thing

35:10.440 --> 35:14.149
but right now he's backed into a corner
and he's desperate.

35:14.240 --> 35:19.109
- Do you really believe that, sir?
- I absolutely do. Bauer's lied to us all day.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.191
He's played us all for fools.

35:50.040 --> 35:53.715
- Flight Operations.
- This is Chloe O'Brian again.

35:53.800 --> 35:57.190
The copilot Don Fagenson
didn't check in when he boarded 520.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.840
- Mr Fagenson didn't board.
- Why not?

35:59.920 --> 36:02.388
- He bas replaced at the last minute.
- By whom?

36:02.480 --> 36:05.313
Scott Evans, the new copilot.

36:14.760 --> 36:19.629
Here are your things. Go back to your seat.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.832
- Jack, it's the copilot Scott Evans.
- How do you know?

36:24.920 --> 36:29.357
He used to fly for Hatton Air, a charter
company that work exclusively for Omicron.

36:29.440 --> 36:32.352
Evans flew Henderson around for over a year.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.989
I need you to patch me through to the captain
so Evans can't hear me.

36:36.080 --> 36:37.559
OK.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.270
Sit down! Now!

36:42.360 --> 36:46.831
Everybody, stay in your seats
and no one will get hurt.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.834
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

36:54.600 --> 36:58.559
- Incoming comm on 139.
- Go ahead.

36:58.640 --> 37:02.349
Captain, this is Jack Bauer.
I'm speaking to you on a discreet channel.

37:02.440 --> 37:05.750
The person that I'm looking for
is sitting next to you.

37:05.840 --> 37:08.673
- He's your copilot Scott Evans.
- That's ridiculous.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.752
Sir, Evans was a last-second replacement.

37:11.840 --> 37:16.436
Can you explain to me why you're not flying
with your regular copilot Don Fagenson?

37:16.960 --> 37:22.080
Captain, Scott Evans has been connected
to a known terrorist.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.355
You need to open the door.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.915
This conversation is over.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.751
Dammit.

37:36.720 --> 37:40.554
- What did he want?
- He's desperate. He wants us to land.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.389
- This is messed up.
- Yeah.

37:45.080 --> 37:48.277
- Bad luck for you, huh?
- Why?

37:48.360 --> 37:50.920
Wasn't Don supposed
to have your seat tonight?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.911
Yeah.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.434
What happened to him?

37:56.520 --> 37:59.398
I don't know. I got the call, so I'm here.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.471
Yeah.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.271
Oh, God.

38:09.360 --> 38:11.271
What's wrong?

38:11.360 --> 38:15.638
Could you, uh...
could you take the stick for a second?

38:15.720 --> 38:18.109
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.395
Just got a cramp in my leg.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.270
Yeah. Those are a bitch.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.713
Yeah.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.870
I'm the on Iy one
who can fly this plane.

38:45.080 --> 38:49.710
Now, you don't strike me as a man who's
willing to die for Christopher Henderson.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.268
Give me the recording.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.715
Go for it.

39:04.960 --> 39:07.349
Slowly get up.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.995
Get back in your seat.

39:15.400 --> 39:20.269
You're donna land this plane
or I'm donna put a bullet in your head.

39:23.720 --> 39:26.632
- Yeah, Jack?
- Advise CTU I have the recording.

39:26.720 --> 39:30.395
I'll be on the ground in less than 15 minutes.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.471
Got it.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.437
- Yes?
- Charles.

39:54.520 --> 39:59.469
If I'm donna live with this
then you're donna have to help me.

40:00.560 --> 40:04.235
- Help you do what, Martha?
- Understand.

40:05.760 --> 40:09.309
I know you're... a good man

40:09.400 --> 40:12.392
and that deep down you...

40:12.480 --> 40:16.075
you do what's best for this country.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.754
- Of course I do.
- Then why...

40:20.320 --> 40:23.949
why didn't you come to me? Why...?

40:24.040 --> 40:28.795
I would have been there for you.
I... couldest talked you through it.

40:28.880 --> 40:33.431
For the last three years you've been one click
away from a nervous breakdown every day,

40:33.520 --> 40:36.512
and I'm donna come to you for advice?

40:39.280 --> 40:42.192
- I have to take another call.
- Oh, no. Charles, no...

40:50.640 --> 40:52.835
- Yes?
- Bauer's got the evidence.

40:52.920 --> 40:56.674
- He is in control of the plane.
- How do you know that?

40:56.760 --> 41:01.276
We just picked up a call
from Chloe O'Brian to Karen Hayes.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.351
What do we do?

41:03.440 --> 41:07.718
You are going to have to shoot down
that plane, Mr President.

41:07.800 --> 41:10.268
- What?
- It's the only option we've got.

41:10.360 --> 41:13.033
Otherwise you go to prison.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.315
For treason and murder.
