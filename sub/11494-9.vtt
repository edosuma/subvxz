WEBVTT

02:33.572 --> 02:36.573
Despite appearances, I think you'll
find the city's on the rise.

02:39.068 --> 02:41.679
Perhaps we should take shelter.

02:42.949 --> 02:44.409
The city's on the rise?

02:44.529 --> 02:46.951
Meereen is strong.

02:46.953 --> 02:48.918
Commerce has returned to the markets.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.455
The people are behind you.

02:53.359 --> 02:55.359
Well, not all the people, of course.

02:55.361 --> 02:58.529
No ruler that ever lived had
the support of all the people.

02:58.531 --> 03:02.866
<i>But the rebirth of Meereen is
the cause of this violence.</i>

03:04.136 --> 03:07.303
The Masters cannot
let Meereen succeed.

03:07.305 --> 03:10.606
Because if Meereen succeeds,
a city without slavery,

03:10.608 --> 03:13.877
a city without Masters...

03:13.879 --> 03:16.579
...it proves that
no one needs a Master.

03:19.417 --> 03:21.484
Good.

03:21.486 --> 03:23.386
Shall we begin?

03:24.922 --> 03:26.755
Do we have a plan?

03:26.757 --> 03:28.824
I will crucify the Masters.

03:28.826 --> 03:30.693
I will set their fleets afire,

03:30.695 --> 03:32.628
kill every last one of their soldiers,

03:32.630 --> 03:34.797
and return their cities to the dirt.

03:34.799 --> 03:37.200
That is my plan.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.103
You don't approve?

03:41.105 --> 03:43.538
You once told me you knew
what your father was.

03:43.540 --> 03:46.308
Did you know his plans
for King's Landing

03:46.310 --> 03:48.744
when the Lannister armies
were at his gates?

03:51.582 --> 03:54.083
Probably not.

03:54.085 --> 03:56.518
Well, he told my brother
and Jaime told me.

03:56.520 --> 04:00.222
<i>He had caches of wildfire
hidden under the Red Keep,</i>

04:00.224 --> 04:02.857
the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor,

04:02.859 --> 04:04.859
all the major thoroughfares.

04:06.563 --> 04:09.130
He would have burned
every one of his citizens.

04:09.132 --> 04:11.565
The loyal ones and the traitors.

04:11.567 --> 04:14.001
Every man, woman, and child.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.502
That's why Jaime killed him.

04:15.504 --> 04:16.904
This is entirely different.

04:16.906 --> 04:19.040
You're talking about destroying cities.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.142
It's not entirely different.

04:24.948 --> 04:28.482
I'd like to suggest
an alternate approach.

04:42.030 --> 04:44.497
Once before, I offered you peace.

04:44.499 --> 04:46.967
If you had not been so arrogant,

04:46.969 --> 04:50.904
you could have returned to your
homeland with a fleet of ships.

04:52.908 --> 04:57.010
Instead, you will flee
Slaver's Bay on foot

04:57.012 --> 04:59.379
like the beggar queen you are.

04:59.381 --> 05:02.515
<i>We are here to
discuss terms of surrender,</i>

05:02.517 --> 05:04.984
not to trade insults.

05:04.986 --> 05:07.019
The terms are simple.

05:07.021 --> 05:10.623
You and your foreign friends
will abandon the Great Pyramid

05:10.625 --> 05:12.124
<i>and the city of Meereen.</i>

05:12.126 --> 05:14.727
<i>The Unsullied you stole
from Kraznys mo Nakloz</i>

05:14.729 --> 05:17.729
<i>will remain to be sold again
to the highest bidder.</i>

05:17.731 --> 05:20.866
<i>The translator you stole from
Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain</i>

05:20.868 --> 05:23.335
to be sold again
to the highest bidder.

05:23.337 --> 05:27.206
The dragons beneath the Great
Pyramid will be slaughtered.

05:28.709 --> 05:31.277
We obviously didn't communicate clearly.

05:31.279 --> 05:34.145
We're here to discuss
your surrender, not mine.

05:37.718 --> 05:40.051
I imagine it's difficult

05:40.053 --> 05:42.654
adjusting to the new reality.

05:45.058 --> 05:48.293
Your reign is over.

05:50.463 --> 05:53.764
My reign has just begun.

08:31.653 --> 08:32.885
Dracarys.

09:16.641 --> 09:18.226
You men have a choice :

09:20.186 --> 09:26.234
fight and die for masters
who would never fight and die for you,

09:26.317 --> 09:29.987
or go home to your families.

09:36.482 --> 09:38.716
Thank you for the armada.

09:38.718 --> 09:40.585
<i>Our queen does love ships.</i>

09:40.587 --> 09:45.756
Now, last time we spoke,
we made a pact.

09:45.758 --> 09:47.958
You violated that pact.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.726
You declared war upon us.

09:49.728 --> 09:52.096
<i>Though our queen does have
a forgiving nature,</i>

09:52.098 --> 09:55.399
this cannot be forgiven.

09:55.401 --> 09:58.368
Our queen insists
that one of you must die

09:58.370 --> 10:00.771
<i>as punishment for your crimes.</i>

10:02.240 --> 10:05.442
It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it,

10:05.444 --> 10:07.243
other people dying?

10:09.048 --> 10:11.214
Him.
He should die.

10:11.216 --> 10:13.584
<i>- Yes, him.</i>
<i>- He's not one of us.</i>

10:13.586 --> 10:15.218
<i>He's an outsider, a lowborn.</i>

10:15.220 --> 10:17.253
<i>He does not speak for us.</i>

10:20.492 --> 10:22.392
Please.

10:24.028 --> 10:25.595
Please.

10:44.315 --> 10:46.616
Tell your people what happened here.

10:48.152 --> 10:51.553
Tell them you live
by the grace of Her Majesty.

10:51.555 --> 10:53.755
When they come forward
with notions of retribution

10:53.757 --> 10:58.260
or ideas about returning the slave
cities to their former glory,

10:58.262 --> 11:00.462
remind them what happened

11:00.464 --> 11:04.132
when Daenerys Stormborn and
her dragons came to Meereen.

11:39.135 --> 11:42.002
You don't have to be here.

11:42.004 --> 11:44.071
Yes, I do.

12:08.863 --> 12:10.763
My beloved wife.

12:13.134 --> 12:15.201
I've missed you terribly.

12:18.606 --> 12:21.874
Thank you for returning
Lady Bolton safely.

12:21.876 --> 12:24.677
Now, dismount and kneel before me,

12:24.679 --> 12:28.013
surrender your army and proclaim
me the true Lord of Winterfell

12:28.015 --> 12:29.781
and Warden of the North.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.850
I will pardon you for
deserting the Night's Watch.

12:31.852 --> 12:35.854
I will pardon these treasonous
lords for betraying my house.

12:39.026 --> 12:41.560
Come, bastard,

12:41.562 --> 12:44.462
you don't have the men,
you don't have the horses,

12:44.464 --> 12:46.765
<i>and you don't have Winterfell.</i>

12:46.767 --> 12:50.501
<i>Why lead those poor souls
into slaughter?</i>

12:50.503 --> 12:53.271
There's no need for a battle.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.241
Get off your horse and kneel.

12:58.112 --> 12:59.944
I'm a man of mercy.

13:04.984 --> 13:06.751
You're right.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.886
There's no need for a battle.

13:10.257 --> 13:13.057
Thousands of men don't need to die.

13:15.094 --> 13:16.761
Only one of us.

13:19.198 --> 13:21.198
Let's end this the old way.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.300
You against me.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.649
I keep hearing stories
about you, bastard.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.917
The way people in the
North talk about you,

13:40.919 --> 13:43.186
you're the greatest
swordsman who ever walked.

13:44.356 --> 13:46.757
Maybe you are that good.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.992
Maybe not.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.627
<i>I don't know if I'd beat you.</i>

13:51.629 --> 13:54.898
But I know that my army
will beat yours.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.066
<i>I have 6,000 men.</i>

13:57.068 --> 14:00.569
You have, what, half that?

14:00.571 --> 14:02.071
Not even?

14:02.073 --> 14:04.107
Aye, you have the numbers.

14:05.510 --> 14:07.142
Will your men want to fight for you

14:07.144 --> 14:10.045
when they hear you
wouldn't fight for them?

14:18.155 --> 14:20.723
He's good.
Very good.

14:22.326 --> 14:24.860
Tell me, will you let
your little brother die

14:24.862 --> 14:27.162
because you're too proud
to surrender?

14:27.164 --> 14:29.131
How do we know you have him?

14:54.624 --> 14:56.324
<i>Now, if you want to save...</i>

14:56.326 --> 14:58.893
You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

15:02.098 --> 15:03.898
Sleep well.

15:12.140 --> 15:15.075
She's a fine woman, your sister.

15:15.077 --> 15:18.178
<i>I look forward to having
her back in my bed.</i>

15:21.617 --> 15:24.184
And you're all fine-looking men.

15:24.186 --> 15:26.453
My dogs are desperate to meet you.

15:26.455 --> 15:28.188
I haven't fed them for seven days.

15:28.190 --> 15:29.589
They're ravenous.

15:29.591 --> 15:32.725
I wonder which parts they'll try first.

15:32.727 --> 15:35.228
<i>Your eyes?</i>

15:35.230 --> 15:36.696
Your balls?

15:38.700 --> 15:41.401
We'll find out soon enough.

15:41.403 --> 15:45.738
In the morning, then, bastard.

16:02.856 --> 16:04.990
<i>If he was smart, he'd stay inside</i>

16:04.992 --> 16:06.858
<i>the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.</i>

16:06.860 --> 16:09.929
That's not his way.
He knows the North is watching.

16:09.931 --> 16:12.864
If the other houses
sense weakness on his part,

16:12.866 --> 16:14.666
they'll stop fearing him.

16:14.668 --> 16:17.436
He can't have that.
Fear is his power.

16:17.438 --> 16:20.138
It's his weakness, too.
His men don't want to fight for him.

16:20.140 --> 16:22.841
They're forced to fight for him.
If they feel the tide turning...

16:22.843 --> 16:25.243
It's not his men that worry me.

16:25.245 --> 16:26.678
It's his horses.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.947
I know what mounted
knights can do to us.

16:28.949 --> 16:32.183
You and Stannis cut through us
like piss through snow.

16:32.185 --> 16:34.518
We're digging trenches
all along our flanks.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.821
They won't be able to hit us
the way that Stannis hit you,

16:36.823 --> 16:38.156
in a double envelopment.

16:42.195 --> 16:44.028
A pincer move.

16:48.935 --> 16:51.535
They won't be able
to hit us from the sides.

16:51.537 --> 16:53.437
Good.

16:55.842 --> 16:58.676
It's crucial that
we let them charge at us.

17:00.079 --> 17:02.680
They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

17:05.518 --> 17:08.617
If we let him buckle
our center, he'll pursue.

17:08.619 --> 17:12.189
Then we'll have him
surrounded on three sides.

17:12.191 --> 17:15.992
Did you really think that cunt
would fight you man-to-man?

17:17.329 --> 17:18.728
No.

17:18.730 --> 17:20.630
But I wanted to make him angry.

17:23.234 --> 17:25.667
I want him coming at us full tilt.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.506
We should all get some sleep.

17:29.508 --> 17:33.342
<i>Rest, Jon Snow. We
need you sharp tomorrow.</i>

17:43.687 --> 17:46.255
So you've met the enemy,

17:46.257 --> 17:49.758
drawn up your battle plans.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.761
Aye, for what they're worth.

17:52.763 --> 17:56.732
You've known him for the space
of a single conversation,

17:56.734 --> 17:58.666
you and your trusted advisors,

17:58.668 --> 18:00.335
<i>and you sit around making your plans</i>

18:00.337 --> 18:03.304
<i>on how to defeat
a man you don't know.</i>

18:03.306 --> 18:04.906
<i>I lived with him.</i>

18:04.908 --> 18:06.641
I know the way his mind works.

18:06.643 --> 18:09.810
I know how he likes to hurt people.

18:09.812 --> 18:14.081
Did it ever once occur to you
that I might have some insight?

18:16.419 --> 18:18.285
You're right.

18:18.287 --> 18:21.022
You think he's going
to fall into your trap.

18:21.024 --> 18:23.390
He won't. He's the
one who lays traps.

18:23.392 --> 18:26.293
- <i>He's overconfident.</i>
- He plays with people.

18:26.295 --> 18:29.030
He's far better at it than you.
He's been doing it all his life.

18:29.032 --> 18:31.965
Aye, and what have I been doing all
my life? Playing with broomsticks?

18:31.967 --> 18:35.869
I fought beyond the Wall against
worse than Ramsay Bolton.

18:35.871 --> 18:38.705
I've defended the Wall
from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

18:38.707 --> 18:41.275
You don't know him.

18:42.545 --> 18:44.578
All right, tell me.

18:44.580 --> 18:47.447
What should we do?
How do we get Rickon back?

18:49.384 --> 18:51.150
We'll never get him back.

18:52.688 --> 18:55.655
Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,

18:55.657 --> 18:57.490
which makes him
a greater threat to Ramsay

18:57.492 --> 19:00.660
than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

19:00.662 --> 19:03.696
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
to Winterfell will be contested,

19:03.698 --> 19:07.300
which means he won't live long.

19:07.302 --> 19:09.768
We can't give up on our brother.

19:09.770 --> 19:12.938
Listen to me, please. He
wants you to make a mistake.

19:12.940 --> 19:16.109
Of course he does. What
should I do differently?

19:16.111 --> 19:18.277
I don't know. I don't know
anything about battles.

19:18.279 --> 19:21.780
Just don't do
what he wants you to do.

19:21.782 --> 19:23.082
Aye, that's good advice.

19:23.084 --> 19:24.583
You think that's obvious?

19:24.585 --> 19:26.018
Well, it is a bit obvious.

19:26.020 --> 19:27.385
If you had asked
for my advice earlier,

19:27.387 --> 19:29.154
I would have told you
not to attack Winterfell

19:29.156 --> 19:31.590
until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious, too?

19:31.592 --> 19:33.959
When will we have a larger force?

19:33.961 --> 19:36.128
We've pleaded with every
house that'll have us.

19:36.130 --> 19:37.462
The Blackfish can't help us.

19:37.464 --> 19:39.531
We're lucky to have this many men.

19:39.533 --> 19:43.034
- It's not enough.
- No, it's not enough. It's what we have.

19:47.407 --> 19:51.376
Battles have been won
against greater odds.

19:57.717 --> 19:59.684
If Ramsay wins,

19:59.686 --> 20:01.719
I'm not going back there alive.

20:01.721 --> 20:03.387
Do you understand me?

20:05.859 --> 20:09.893
I won't let ever
let him touch you again.

20:12.765 --> 20:14.898
I'll protect you, I promise.

20:16.202 --> 20:18.735
No one can protect me.

20:18.737 --> 20:20.638
No one can protect anyone.

20:39.357 --> 20:41.457
<i>You think there's hope?</i>

20:41.459 --> 20:43.893
I've never seen
these Bolton fuckers fight.

20:43.895 --> 20:46.362
And they've never seen
the free folk fight,

20:46.364 --> 20:48.364
so, yes, there's hope.

20:50.535 --> 20:54.170
You want to avenge
your king, don't you?

20:54.172 --> 20:57.073
It wasn't the Boltons
defeated Stannis.

20:57.075 --> 20:59.675
It was Stannis himself.

20:59.677 --> 21:01.410
I loved the man.

21:01.412 --> 21:03.946
He lifted me up
and made me something.

21:03.948 --> 21:07.183
But he had demons in his skull
whispering foul things.

21:07.185 --> 21:09.785
- You saw these demons?
- What?

21:10.988 --> 21:13.255
No, it's a manner of speaking.

21:14.959 --> 21:18.126
Not actual demons.

21:18.128 --> 21:19.561
Oh.

21:19.563 --> 21:22.631
Well, you loved that cunt Stannis

21:22.633 --> 21:24.866
and I loved the man he burned.

21:24.868 --> 21:26.968
Mance didn't have
demons in his skull.

21:26.970 --> 21:30.572
He didn't torch people
or listen to some red witch.

21:30.574 --> 21:33.041
I believed in him.

21:33.043 --> 21:37.112
I thought he was the man to
lead us through the Long Night.

21:37.114 --> 21:39.380
But I was wrong just like you.

21:41.317 --> 21:44.452
Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

21:46.156 --> 21:48.589
Jon Snow's not a king.

21:50.326 --> 21:52.126
No, he's not.

21:55.197 --> 21:59.333
<i>I need a good drink to help me
sleep the night before a fight.</i>

21:59.335 --> 22:00.901
You want some?

22:00.903 --> 22:03.404
I have a jug of sour goat's milk

22:03.406 --> 22:05.472
stronger than any of that grape water

22:05.474 --> 22:07.741
you southern twats like sucking on.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.676
No, thanks.
It does sound delicious,

22:09.678 --> 22:12.379
but I better keep a clear head.

22:12.381 --> 22:14.782
I can never sleep
the night before a battle.

22:14.784 --> 22:16.583
So what do you do all night?

22:16.585 --> 22:18.852
I walk.

22:18.854 --> 22:20.720
Think and walk.

22:20.722 --> 22:22.922
Think and walk until I'm
far enough away from camp

22:22.924 --> 22:25.124
that no one can hear me
shitting my guts out.

22:27.195 --> 22:29.128
Happy shitting.

22:42.410 --> 22:43.475
My lady.

22:47.982 --> 22:50.382
You weren't at the war council.

22:51.886 --> 22:53.820
I'm not a soldier.

22:54.888 --> 22:57.323
Any advice?

22:57.325 --> 22:59.658
Don't lose.

23:05.466 --> 23:07.533
If I do, if I fall...

23:10.037 --> 23:12.670
don't bring me back.

23:12.672 --> 23:14.706
I'll have to try.

23:14.708 --> 23:16.908
I'm ordering you not to bring me back.

23:16.910 --> 23:18.643
I am not your servant, Jon Snow.

23:18.645 --> 23:21.046
You're in my camp.
I'm the commander.

23:21.048 --> 23:23.815
I serve the Lord of Light.

23:23.817 --> 23:26.151
I do what he commands.

23:26.153 --> 23:27.585
How do you know what he commands?

23:29.055 --> 23:32.423
I interpret his signs

23:32.425 --> 23:34.592
as well as I can.

23:37.129 --> 23:39.597
If the Lord didn't
want me to bring you back,

23:39.599 --> 23:42.266
how did I bring you back?

23:42.268 --> 23:44.902
I have no power.

23:44.904 --> 23:48.272
Only what he gives me
and he gave me you.

23:49.608 --> 23:52.009
Why?

23:52.011 --> 23:54.178
I don't know.

23:58.751 --> 24:03.387
Maybe you're only needed for this small
part of his plan and nothing else.

24:03.389 --> 24:06.390
Maybe he brought you here
to die again.

24:10.596 --> 24:13.630
What kind of god would do
something like that?

24:15.367 --> 24:17.700
The one we've got.

26:07.509 --> 26:10.710
Last time we saw each other
was at Winterfell, yes?

26:13.748 --> 26:17.049
You were making jokes about
my height, I seem to recall.

26:19.353 --> 26:21.453
Everyone who makes a joke
about a dwarf's height

26:21.455 --> 26:25.391
thinks he's the only person ever to
make a joke about a dwarf's height.

26:25.393 --> 26:28.828
"The height of nobility,"
"a man of your stature,"

26:28.830 --> 26:30.662
"someone to look up to."

26:32.199 --> 26:34.166
You're all making the same
five or six jokes.

26:34.168 --> 26:37.536
- It was a long time ago.
- It was.

26:37.538 --> 26:40.906
And how have things been
going for you since then?

26:40.908 --> 26:43.808
Not so well, I gather.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.411
Can't imagine you would
have murdered the Stark boys

26:46.413 --> 26:47.746
if things had been going well.

26:47.748 --> 26:49.447
I didn't murder the Stark boys.

26:49.449 --> 26:52.383
But I did things that were
just as bad or worse.

26:52.385 --> 26:53.718
And he paid for them.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.787
Doesn't seem like it.

26:55.789 --> 26:57.722
He's still alive.

26:57.724 --> 26:59.791
It was complicated for you, I'm sure,

26:59.793 --> 27:02.060
growing up at Winterfell.

27:02.062 --> 27:05.329
Never quite knowing who you were.

27:05.331 --> 27:08.966
But then, we all live
complicated lives, don't we?

27:08.968 --> 27:11.035
You've brought us 100 ships
from the Iron Fleet

27:11.037 --> 27:12.770
<i>with men to sail them.</i>

27:12.772 --> 27:15.073
In return, I expect
you want me to support

27:15.075 --> 27:17.608
your claim to the throne
of the Iron Islands?

27:17.610 --> 27:19.610
Not my claim.
Hers.

27:19.612 --> 27:21.712
And what's wrong with you?

27:21.714 --> 27:23.280
I'm not fit to rule.

27:23.282 --> 27:24.982
We can agree upon that at least.

27:24.984 --> 27:27.651
Has the Iron Islands
ever had a queen before?

27:27.653 --> 27:29.252
No more than Westeros.

27:31.023 --> 27:34.458
Our Uncle Euron returned home
after a long absence.

27:34.460 --> 27:38.094
He murdered our father and took
the Salt Throne from Yara.

27:38.096 --> 27:40.663
He would have murdered us
if we'd stayed.

27:42.133 --> 27:45.300
Lord Tyrion tells me your
father was a terrible king.

27:45.302 --> 27:47.436
You and I have that in common.

27:49.040 --> 27:50.305
We do.

27:50.307 --> 27:52.642
And both murdered
by a usurper as well.

27:53.977 --> 27:55.644
Will their ships be enough?

27:55.646 --> 27:58.780
With the former Masters' fleet, possibly.

27:58.782 --> 28:00.915
Barely.

28:00.917 --> 28:03.718
There are more than 100
ships in the Iron Fleet.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.221
There are and Euron is building more.

28:06.223 --> 28:07.956
He's going to offer them to you.

28:07.958 --> 28:09.458
So why shouldn't I wait for him?

28:09.460 --> 28:12.127
The Iron Fleet
isn't all he's bringing.

28:12.129 --> 28:14.328
He also wants
to give you...

28:14.330 --> 28:18.066
His big cock, I think he said.

28:18.068 --> 28:21.402
<i>Euron's offer is also an
offer of marriage, you see.</i>

28:21.404 --> 28:23.271
<i>You won't get one without the other.</i>

28:23.273 --> 28:25.907
And I imagine your offer is
free of any marriage demands?

28:25.909 --> 28:29.210
I never demand, but I'm
up for anything, really.

28:31.047 --> 28:33.814
<i>He murdered our father
and would have murdered us.</i>

28:33.816 --> 28:36.484
<i>He'll murder you as soon
as you have what he wants.</i>

28:36.486 --> 28:38.219
The Seven Kingdoms.

28:38.221 --> 28:39.520
All of them.

28:39.522 --> 28:41.289
And you don't want
the Seven Kingdoms?

28:41.291 --> 28:44.658
Your ancestors defeated ours
and took the Iron Islands.

28:44.660 --> 28:47.260
We ask you to give them back.

28:47.262 --> 28:48.628
And that's all?

28:48.630 --> 28:51.264
We'd like you to help us
murder an uncle or two

28:51.266 --> 28:53.233
who don't think
a woman's fit to rule.

28:53.235 --> 28:54.902
Reasonable.

28:57.206 --> 28:59.872
What if everyone starts
demanding their independence?

28:59.874 --> 29:02.008
She's not demanding, she's asking.

29:02.010 --> 29:04.777
The others are free to ask as well.

29:08.584 --> 29:12.085
Our fathers were evil men,
all of us here.

29:12.087 --> 29:14.654
They left the world
worse than they found it.

29:14.656 --> 29:16.322
<i>We're not going to do that.</i>

29:16.324 --> 29:19.358
We're going to leave the world
better than we found it.

29:21.362 --> 29:24.964
You will support my claim as
queen of the Seven Kingdoms

29:24.966 --> 29:28.367
and respect the integrity
of the Seven Kingdoms.

29:28.369 --> 29:32.938
No more reaving, roving,
raiding, or raping.

29:34.275 --> 29:35.841
That's our way of life.

29:35.843 --> 29:37.376
No more.

29:44.918 --> 29:46.652
No more.

33:31.204 --> 33:33.905
Do you like games, little man?

33:33.907 --> 33:35.974
Let's play a game.

33:39.613 --> 33:41.379
Run to your brother.

33:41.381 --> 33:43.314
The sooner you make it to him,

33:43.316 --> 33:45.716
the sooner you get to see him again.

33:48.355 --> 33:49.954
That's it.

33:49.956 --> 33:52.190
That's the game.

33:52.192 --> 33:54.192
Easy.

33:54.194 --> 33:56.194
Ready?

33:56.196 --> 33:57.461
Go.

34:01.433 --> 34:04.502
No, you have to run, remember?

34:04.504 --> 34:06.670
Those are the rules.

34:19.150 --> 34:21.551
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

34:47.311 --> 34:49.011
Hyah! Hyah!

36:05.221 --> 36:06.686
Don't.

36:17.432 --> 36:18.798
Prepare to charge.

36:20.902 --> 36:22.268
Prepare to charge.

36:24.006 --> 36:26.672
<i>- Draw!</i>
<i>- Draw!</i>

36:26.674 --> 36:28.874
<i>Draw!</i>

36:28.876 --> 36:30.343
<i>Loose!</i>

36:32.046 --> 36:34.180
Hyah! Hyah!

36:37.852 --> 36:40.319
Go! Go!
Follow your commander!

36:45.425 --> 36:47.259
Run and fight!

37:14.254 --> 37:15.286
Hyah!

37:15.288 --> 37:18.056
<i>Nock!</i>

37:18.058 --> 37:20.558
<i>- Draw!</i>
<i>- Draw!</i>

37:20.560 --> 37:22.226
<i>- Loose!</i>
<i>- Loose!</i>

37:31.671 --> 37:33.003
Now.

37:33.005 --> 37:37.340
<i>Cavalry, charge!</i>

38:30.326 --> 38:33.128
- Nock!
<i>- Nock!</i>

38:33.130 --> 38:35.630
- Nock!
<i>- Nock!</i>

38:37.667 --> 38:39.367
- Draw!
- Draw!

38:39.369 --> 38:42.170
- Draw!
<i>- Draw!</i>

38:45.174 --> 38:47.475
We'll just kill our own men.
Stand down.

38:47.477 --> 38:50.244
- Loose!
- Loose!

39:30.385 --> 39:32.352
Get word...

39:51.071 --> 39:53.472
<i>No!</i>

40:07.120 --> 40:08.720
Loose!

40:24.237 --> 40:26.371
- Loose!
<i>- Loose!</i>

40:33.646 --> 40:36.013
- Loose!
<i>- Loose!</i>

41:04.777 --> 41:08.378
We may as well be
taking shits back here.

41:08.380 --> 41:11.581
Follow!

41:17.989 --> 41:20.223
It's time, go.

41:22.027 --> 41:24.794
- Who owns the North?
- We do!

41:24.796 --> 41:27.630
- Who owns the North?
- We do!

41:27.632 --> 41:29.264
Show me!

41:58.695 --> 42:00.162
Hey!

42:58.020 --> 43:01.454
<i>Infantry, advance!</i>

43:33.387 --> 43:36.255
With me, lads!
Break their line!

44:10.022 --> 44:11.255
Help me!

44:39.718 --> 44:41.618
- Tormund!
- Get him back!

44:41.620 --> 44:44.354
<i>Infantry, advance.</i>

44:49.628 --> 44:52.128
<i>Both sides!</i>

44:52.130 --> 44:54.063
<i>Fall back!</i>

44:54.065 --> 44:57.166
<i>Fall back!</i>

45:17.522 --> 45:19.555
Fuck this, come on!

45:29.499 --> 45:31.566
We're going home!

49:47.883 --> 49:50.049
<i>Open the gate!</i>

49:54.889 --> 49:57.256
<i>Archers to the wall.</i>

49:59.227 --> 50:01.493
- Their army's gone.
- Our army's gone.

50:02.863 --> 50:04.763
We have Winterfell.

50:04.765 --> 50:07.332
They don't have the men for a siege.
All we have to do is wait.

50:07.334 --> 50:09.234
<i> Archers!</i>

50:09.236 --> 50:10.936
To the wall!

51:45.096 --> 51:47.997
You suggested one-on-one
combat, didn't you?

51:55.706 --> 51:58.306
I've reconsidered.

51:58.308 --> 52:01.777
I think that sounds
like a wonderful idea.

54:01.662 --> 54:04.395
We're going to bury
my brother in the crypt

54:04.397 --> 54:06.497
next to my father.

54:12.739 --> 54:13.905
Jon.

54:19.512 --> 54:21.679
Where is he?

54:48.940 --> 54:51.641
Ah.

54:51.643 --> 54:53.210
Sansa.

54:56.682 --> 54:58.881
Hello, Sansa.

55:06.224 --> 55:08.891
Is this where I'll be staying now?

55:17.268 --> 55:19.301
No.

55:23.073 --> 55:26.875
Our time together is
about to come to an end.

55:29.780 --> 55:32.314
<i>That's all right.</i>

55:32.316 --> 55:34.149
You can't kill me.

55:35.753 --> 55:37.919
I'm part of you now.

55:40.690 --> 55:42.991
Your words will disappear.

55:45.662 --> 55:48.529
Your house will disappear.

55:48.531 --> 55:51.733
<i>Your name will disappear.</i>

55:53.703 --> 55:56.304
<i>All memory of you will disappear.</i>

56:23.365 --> 56:26.133
My hounds will never harm me.

56:26.135 --> 56:28.635
You haven't fed them in seven days.

56:28.637 --> 56:30.136
You said it yourself.

56:34.343 --> 56:36.075
They're loyal beasts.

56:36.077 --> 56:37.977
<i>They were.</i>

56:37.979 --> 56:39.879
Now they're starving.

57:03.904 --> 57:05.871
Sit.

57:05.873 --> 57:07.406
Down.

57:07.408 --> 57:10.008
Down!

57:11.078 --> 57:13.379
Down! Down!

57:13.381 --> 57:15.314
Down!
