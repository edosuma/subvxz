KATARA: <i>Water, earth,</i>

00:05.880 --> 00:09.180
<i>fire, air...</i>

00:10.300 --> 00:14.350
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:14.430 --> 00:17.730
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:18.770 --> 00:22.690
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.</i>

00:22.770 --> 00:24.610
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

00:24.690 --> 00:25.990
<i>he vanished.</i>

00:26.400 --> 00:30.200
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

00:30.280 --> 00:31.870
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

00:31.950 --> 00:34.240
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

00:34.330 --> 00:37.000
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

00:37.960 --> 00:41.250
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

01:13.530 --> 01:15.660
Nice try, Pupil Sangok.

01:15.740 --> 01:17.000
A couple of more years,

01:17.080 --> 01:19.330
and you might be ready
to fight a sea sponge.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.880
Whoa!

01:23.380 --> 01:26.300
Would anyone care for
a rematch with Katara?

01:26.380 --> 01:28.550
( GROANING )

01:28.630 --> 01:30.930
Katara, you've
advanced more quickly

01:31.010 --> 01:33.010
than any student I've ever trained.

01:33.090 --> 01:35.930
You have proven
that with fierce determination,

01:36.010 --> 01:37.770
passion, and hard work,

01:37.850 --> 01:39.980
you can accomplish anything.

01:40.520 --> 01:43.150
Raw talent alone is not enough.

01:43.230 --> 01:44.360
Pupil Aang!

01:44.440 --> 01:45.650
Yes, Master Pakku?

01:45.730 --> 01:48.320
Care to step into
the sparring circle?

01:48.400 --> 01:51.200
I figure since you've found time
to play with house pets,

01:51.280 --> 01:54.160
you must have
already mastered waterbending.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.780
I wouldn't say mastered,

01:55.870 --> 01:57.240
but check this out!

02:07.630 --> 02:09.960
YUE: So, they don't have palaces
in the Southern Tribe?

02:10.050 --> 02:11.220
Are you kidding?

02:11.300 --> 02:12.680
I grew up in a block of ice.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.720
It's not exactly a cultural hub.

Sokka, this is wrong.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.480
We're taking a walk!

02:22.560 --> 02:23.810
I'm engaged.

02:23.900 --> 02:25.940
It just feels...

02:26.810 --> 02:28.150
I know what you need.

02:28.230 --> 02:29.860
You need to meet my good friend Appa.

Who?

( GROWLING )

02:32.490 --> 02:34.610
Appa and I go way back,
don't we, boy?

02:34.700 --> 02:36.780
Aagh! Easy!

02:36.870 --> 02:37.910
Down, boy!

02:37.990 --> 02:39.040
No, up!

02:39.120 --> 02:42.000

giving Appa enough attention.

Mm-hmm.

Yip, yip.

Oh, my goodness!

02:55.840 --> 02:56.890
Wow!

02:56.970 --> 02:59.810
I can't believe you do this every day.

02:59.890 --> 03:02.270
Yeah, we pretty much live up here.

03:02.350 --> 03:05.060
Is it always this cold in the sky?

03:06.060 --> 03:07.690
Not when you're with someone.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.860
It's beautiful up here.

03:10.940 --> 03:11.980
Yeah.

SOKKA: Soot.
YUE: What?

03:53.990 --> 03:55.490
I've seen it before.

03:55.570 --> 03:57.410
Right before my village was attacked.

03:57.490 --> 03:59.410
It's soot mixed with snow.

03:59.490 --> 04:00.580
But why?

04:00.660 --> 04:02.330
It's the Fire Nation.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.200
They've closed in on the North Pole.

04:04.290 --> 04:05.960
And from the looks of this stuff,

04:06.040 --> 04:08.040
I'd say there's a lot of them.

04:11.710 --> 04:15.470
ZHAO: This will truly be one for
the history books, General Iroh.

04:15.550 --> 04:18.090
Just think. Centuries from now,

04:18.180 --> 04:20.300
people will study
the Great Admiral Zhao,

04:20.390 --> 04:21.640
who destroyed the last

04:21.720 --> 04:23.890
of the Water Tribe civilization.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.100
You're lucky you're here to see it.

04:26.180 --> 04:29.020
Be careful what you wish for, Admiral.

04:29.100 --> 04:32.270
History is not always kind
to its subjects.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.150
I suppose you speak from experience.

04:35.230 --> 04:38.150
But, rest assured,
this will be nothing like

04:38.240 --> 04:41.660
your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.080
I hope not, for your sake.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.290
Tell the captains to prepare
for first strike.

04:55.210 --> 04:57.010
We'll be landing soon.

04:57.090 --> 04:58.590
Do you have a plan?

05:12.520 --> 05:13.560
No, Sokka.

05:13.650 --> 05:14.690
Wait.

05:14.770 --> 05:16.320
I can't see you anymore.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.440
Not at all.

05:17.530 --> 05:19.320
What? We're just friends.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.610
I wish we could just be friends.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.200
But I like you too much,

05:23.280 --> 05:25.620
and it's too confusing
to be around you.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.750
I'm marrying someone else.

05:27.950 --> 05:30.330
You don't love him, do you?

05:30.410 --> 05:32.250
You don't even seem to like him.

05:32.330 --> 05:34.000
But I do love my people.

05:34.090 --> 05:36.420
You're not marrying them!

05:36.500 --> 05:38.260
You don't understand.

05:38.340 --> 05:39.920
I have duties to my father,

05:40.010 --> 05:41.220
to my tribe.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.720
I have to do this.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.100
Good-bye.

05:47.100 --> 05:50.480
The day we have feared
for so long has arrived.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.560
The Fire Nation is on our doorstep.

05:53.650 --> 05:56.190
It is with great sadness

05:56.270 --> 05:58.990
I call my family here before me,

05:59.070 --> 06:02.200
knowing well that some of these faces

06:02.280 --> 06:05.280
are about to vanish from our tribe.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.750
But they will never vanish
from our hearts.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.830
Now, as we approach
the battle for our existence,

06:13.920 --> 06:17.040
I call upon the great spirits.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.130
Spirit of the ocean,

06:20.210 --> 06:23.930
spirit of the moon, be with us!

for a dangerous mission.

- Sokka...

Be warned.

06:32.060 --> 06:34.730
Many of you will not return.

06:34.810 --> 06:36.730
Come forward to receive my mark

06:36.810 --> 06:39.320
if you accept the task.

07:06.300 --> 07:09.140
The stillness before battle
is unbearable.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.720
Such a quiet dread.

07:11.810 --> 07:14.730
I wasn't there when the Fire Nation
attacked my people.

You've gotta be kidding me.

10:17.370 --> 10:20.870
Men, you'll be infiltrating
the Fire Nation navy.

10:21.210 --> 10:25.170
That means you'll all need
one of these uniforms.

10:27.590 --> 10:28.840
( LAUGHTER )

10:30.670 --> 10:32.220
What's your problem?

10:32.300 --> 10:34.760
Fire navy uniforms
don't look like that.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.470
Of course they do.

10:36.550 --> 10:40.060
These are real uniforms captured
from actual fire navy soldiers.

10:40.350 --> 10:42.600
When, like, 100 years ago?

10:43.060 --> 10:44.440
85.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.860
The Fire Nation doesn't wear
shoulder spikes anymore.

10:46.940 --> 10:50.030
The newer uniforms
are more streamlined.

10:50.110 --> 10:51.940
How do we know we can trust this guy?

10:52.030 --> 10:54.530
Such bold talk for a new recruit.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.740
Sokka is from our sister tribe, Hahn.

10:56.820 --> 11:01.080
He is a capable warrior,
and I value his input.

11:01.410 --> 11:04.210
Now, our first objective
is to determine

11:04.290 --> 11:07.130
the identity
of their commanding officer.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.920
His name is Zhao.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.590
Middle-aged, big sideburns,
bigger temper...

11:12.970 --> 11:16.720
Sokka, I want you to tell
everything you know to Hahn.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.600
He's leading this mission.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.890
Hahn, show Sokka your respect.

11:20.970 --> 11:24.690
I expect nothing less
from my future son-in-law.

11:27.150 --> 11:28.900
Princess Yue's marrying you?

11:28.980 --> 11:30.570
Yeah. What of it?

11:30.650 --> 11:32.780
Nothing. Congratulations.

11:39.410 --> 11:41.160
Stop those fireballs!

11:50.540 --> 11:52.460
IROH: It's almost twilight, Admiral.

11:52.550 --> 11:53.840
As your military consultant,

11:53.920 --> 11:56.680
I must advise you to halt your attack.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.760
The waterbenders draw their power
from the moon,

11:59.850 --> 12:01.930
and it is nearly full tonight.

12:02.010 --> 12:05.140
You should wait
and resume the attack at daybreak.

12:05.230 --> 12:07.230
ZHAO: Oh, I am well aware
of the moon problem.

12:07.310 --> 12:10.110
And I'm working on a solution.

12:10.190 --> 12:12.780
But for now, daybreak it is.

12:19.820 --> 12:21.450

12:28.790 --> 12:30.580
I can't do it.

12:30.670 --> 12:31.880
I can't do it.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.300
KATARA: What happened?

12:33.380 --> 12:35.760
I must have taken out
a dozen fire navy ships,

12:35.840 --> 12:38.550
but there's just too many of them.

12:38.630 --> 12:40.180
I can't fight them all!

12:40.260 --> 12:42.050
But you have to.

12:42.140 --> 12:43.560
You're the Avatar.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.740
If you are fishing
for an octopus, my nephew,

12:57.820 --> 13:00.240
you need a tightly woven net,

13:00.320 --> 13:04.030
or he will squeeze through
the tiniest hole and escape.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.120
I don't need your wisdom
right now, Uncle.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.620
I'm sorry, I just nag you because...

13:09.710 --> 13:13.040
Well, ever since I lost my son...

13:13.500 --> 13:15.920
Uncle, you don't have to say it.

13:16.010 --> 13:18.470
I think of you as my own.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.090
I know, Uncle.

13:22.180 --> 13:23.350
We'll meet again.

After I have the Avatar.

13:29.980 --> 13:32.100
Remember your breath of fire.

13:32.190 --> 13:33.770
It could save your life out there.

13:33.860 --> 13:34.900
I will.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.820
And put your hood up.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.610
Keep your ears warm.

13:38.690 --> 13:39.990
I'll be fine!

13:48.500 --> 13:49.910
Let me tell you, Sokka,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.170
I've courted a lot of girls,
but Yue is the finest.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.250
And she comes with the most perks.

13:55.340 --> 13:57.590
Perks?! What does that mean?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.970
I mean,
Yue's nice and everything,

14:00.050 --> 14:02.130
but the points I'll gain
with the chief aren't bad either.

14:02.220 --> 14:05.850
Princess Yue is wasted
on a self-absorbed weasel like you!

14:06.220 --> 14:07.560
Whoa, hang on!

14:07.640 --> 14:08.810
What do you care?

14:08.890 --> 14:11.310
You're just a simple rube
from the Southern Tribe.

complexities of our life?

was the first waterbender.

15:32.180 --> 15:34.770
Our ancestors saw how it pushed
and pulled the tides,

15:34.850 --> 15:36.770
and learned how to do it themselves.

15:36.850 --> 15:40.270
KATARA: I've always noticed
my waterbending is stronger at night.

15:40.360 --> 15:43.240
Our strength comes from
the spirit of the moon,

15:43.320 --> 15:45.700
our life comes from the spirit
of the ocean.

15:45.780 --> 15:48.370
They work together to keep balance.

Maybe I can find them
and get their help.

15:52.740 --> 15:54.120
How can you do that?

15:54.200 --> 15:55.750
The avatar is the bridge

15:55.830 --> 15:57.830
between our world
and the spirit world.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.290
Aang can talk to them!

15:59.380 --> 16:02.340
Maybe they'll give you the wisdom
to win this battle.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.880
Or maybe they'll unleash

16:04.010 --> 16:06.470
a crazy-amazing spirit attack
on the Fire Nation!

16:08.510 --> 16:10.180
Or wisdom. That's good, too.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.970
The only problem is,

16:12.060 --> 16:14.480
the last time you got
to the spirit world by accident.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.270
How are you going
to get there this time?

16:16.350 --> 16:18.600
I have an idea. Follow me.

16:25.490 --> 16:27.450
So, is this the way
to the spirit world?

16:27.530 --> 16:28.610
Ha ha ha. No.

16:28.700 --> 16:31.580
You'll have to get there on your own.
But I can take you

16:31.660 --> 16:34.830
to the most spiritual place
in the entire North Pole.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.710
( GASPS )

16:51.680 --> 16:54.600
I never thought
I'd miss grass this much!

16:54.680 --> 16:57.480
It's so warm here!
How is that possible?

16:57.560 --> 17:00.850
It's the center
of all spiritual energy in our land.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.780
You're right, Yue.

17:11.870 --> 17:13.450
I can feel...

17:13.530 --> 17:14.620
Something.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.910
It's so...

17:15.990 --> 17:17.410
Tranquil.

17:19.710 --> 17:21.710
( ANIMALS CALLING )

17:30.970 --> 17:32.590
( SHUDDERING )

17:35.260 --> 17:36.310
Be quiet!

17:36.390 --> 17:38.100
( LOWING STOPS )

17:40.810 --> 17:42.810
( LOWING )

17:56.490 --> 17:58.500
CHIEF: Is something wrong, Sokka?

17:58.580 --> 17:59.710
Oh, no.

17:59.790 --> 18:01.370
Hahn's out there
on the top-secret mission,

18:01.460 --> 18:03.330
while I'm here
sharpening my boomerang.

18:03.420 --> 18:04.710
Everything's fine.

18:04.790 --> 18:06.250
Listen to me.

18:06.340 --> 18:09.050
I took you off the mission
for selfish reasons.

18:09.130 --> 18:12.130
I have a special task in mind for you.

18:12.220 --> 18:13.930
What, you want me
to scrub the barracks?

18:14.010 --> 18:17.890
I want you to guard my daughter,
Princess Yue.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.310
Oh. Sure.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.190
That shouldn't be too hard.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.700
( GASPING )

19:06.440 --> 19:08.610
( GASPING )

19:15.200 --> 19:17.160
YUE: ( WHISPERING )
Why is he sitting like that?

19:17.240 --> 19:18.530
He's meditating.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.830
Trying to cross over
into the spirit world.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.080
It takes all his concentration.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.210
Is there any way we can help?

19:25.290 --> 19:26.960
AANG: How about some quiet?!

19:27.040 --> 19:30.170
Come on, guys,
I can hear every word you're saying.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.780
Is he ok?

19:51.860 --> 19:53.650
He's crossing into the spirit world.

19:53.740 --> 19:56.110
He'll be fine as long as
we don't move his body.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.530
That's his way back
to the physical world.

19:58.620 --> 19:59.950
Maybe we should get some help?

20:00.030 --> 20:01.580
No. He's my friend.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.950
I'm perfectly capable
of protecting him.

20:04.330 --> 20:07.250
ZUKO: Well, aren't you a big girl now?

20:07.330 --> 20:08.380
No...

20:08.460 --> 20:09.500
Yes.

20:09.580 --> 20:12.050
Hand him over
and I won't have to hurt you.

20:14.800 --> 20:15.970
Hyah!

20:23.930 --> 20:25.600
I see you've learned a new trick.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.560
But I didn't come this far
to lose to you.

20:47.790 --> 20:49.880
You little peasant.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.000
You've found a master, haven't you?

20:55.550 --> 20:57.010
Hyah!

21:02.100 --> 21:03.510
Hyah! Hyah...

21:08.310 --> 21:10.310
Aah! Uh!

21:11.060 --> 21:12.900
Hyah! Hyah...

21:26.080 --> 21:28.330
It's daybreak at last.

21:28.710 --> 21:30.710
Let's write history.

21:52.560 --> 21:56.400
You rise with the moon,
I rise with the sun.

22:05.030 --> 22:07.790
( ALL YELLING )

22:07.870 --> 22:11.500
The Water Tribe can try
to resist the inevitable,

22:12.290 --> 22:14.840
but their city will fall today.

22:20.470 --> 22:21.760
( GASPS )

22:22.220 --> 22:24.010
Aang?!

22:25.890 --> 22:27.810
What happened?! Where's Zuko?!

22:27.890 --> 22:29.020
He took Aang.

22:29.100 --> 22:31.430
He took him right out from under me.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.900
SOKKA: Where did they go?
