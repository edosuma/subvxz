00:01.109 --> 00:04.140
This is gonna be her
first real relationship.

00:04.165 --> 00:05.231
Right. I got it.

00:05.256 --> 00:06.538
Go slow, if you can.

00:06.563 --> 00:08.140
Okay, hold on.

Ayo: <i>Her oxytocin levels

00:09.913 --> 00:11.680

00:11.705 --> 00:13.171
Things are heating up.

00:13.196 --> 00:15.658
The more physically
intimate you guys are,

00:15.683 --> 00:18.016
the more it's gonna mess
with your ability to stitch.

00:18.041 --> 00:19.578
Wait, you're handling this stitch?

00:19.603 --> 00:22.429
He's got the yips. He's
worried about you.

00:22.454 --> 00:24.869
I have a history of watching
people I care about

00:24.894 --> 00:26.609
get into bad situations or worse.

00:26.634 --> 00:27.656
Then maybe we shouldn't be together.

00:27.681 --> 00:28.869
Do you know how hard
it is for Kirsten

00:28.894 --> 00:30.055
to keep seeing her
mother like that?

00:30.080 --> 00:31.947
And where exactly

00:31.972 --> 00:35.156
does Kirsten see Jacqueline
Stinger cooped up?

00:35.328 --> 00:36.721
How could you betray me?

00:36.746 --> 00:39.476
Kirsten, I didn't mean to, I just...
Can we please talk?

00:39.501 --> 00:41.070
Listen to me! Just...

00:41.095 --> 00:42.127
(door slams)

00:42.152 --> 00:44.085
I don't wanna lose you,

00:44.110 --> 00:46.562
but I don't know how to fix this.

00:46.587 --> 00:48.993

Kirsten. What?

02:40.800 --> 02:43.066
Where is everyone?

02:43.407 --> 02:46.166
I don't know. I bounced from the
stitch and everyone was gone.

02:46.191 --> 02:49.826
(sniffs) What is that smell?

02:49.851 --> 02:52.118
- Were we gassed?
- Yeah, I think, maybe.

02:52.143 --> 02:54.603
What's the last thing you remember?

02:54.983 --> 03:00.086
I don't... I was prepping
for a stitch and then...

03:00.122 --> 03:01.788
Yeah, I...

03:01.823 --> 03:05.561
I said "Ow" and... Oh
my God, my face. Did...

03:06.261 --> 03:08.795
I feel like someone slugged me.
Is my cheek red?

03:08.830 --> 03:10.797
Oh, no, no, no. It's fine.

03:10.832 --> 03:11.965
Okay.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.507
All right, we need to search the lab.

03:13.532 --> 03:14.167
Yep.

03:14.202 --> 03:16.803
Yeah, it was like this when I bounced.

03:16.838 --> 03:20.419
I'ts like everyone but the two
of us vanished into thin air.

03:20.444 --> 03:21.710
What's with the monitors?

03:21.746 --> 03:23.498
I don't know, but they're
static in the lab, too.

03:23.523 --> 03:26.108
You weren't kiddin', this
place is a ghost town.

03:26.133 --> 03:28.100
Look.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.467
(gasps) Ow!

03:29.492 --> 03:31.069
That's really hot.

03:31.094 --> 03:33.923
- Whatever happened...
- We just missed it.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.360
Oh, great, even our corpse is missing.

03:37.396 --> 03:39.629
Do you remember who he or she was?

03:39.664 --> 03:41.679
Yeah, he was, uh...

03:41.704 --> 03:43.037
She was...

03:43.062 --> 03:45.683
Oh, I can't remember.

03:46.275 --> 03:48.701
Is this a side effect of being gassed?

03:48.726 --> 03:50.759
I don't know, but it's got organized
attack written all over it.

03:50.795 --> 03:52.661
We got to call this in.

03:53.731 --> 03:55.831
(line beeping)

03:55.867 --> 03:57.066
Line's dead.

03:57.091 --> 03:59.115
Okay, let me have your phone.

03:59.737 --> 04:02.034
(keypad beeping)

04:02.848 --> 04:05.035
(voicemail): <i>You've reached Camille.
Leave me a message.</i>

04:05.060 --> 04:07.896
<i>Or, you know, send a text
like a normal person.</i>

04:07.921 --> 04:09.600
<i>- Okay, bye!</i>
- (beeps)

04:09.625 --> 04:11.391
Camille, this is Kirsten and Cameron.

04:11.416 --> 04:14.134
Call us as soon as you get this.
We're worried about you.

04:15.304 --> 04:16.882
Who would wanna do
something like this,

04:16.906 --> 04:18.521
and who would actually
be able to do it?

04:18.546 --> 04:22.415
Off the top of my head, Stinger, Blair.

04:22.450 --> 04:24.241
Ivy might even be involved.

04:24.266 --> 04:25.913
I'm sorry, you asked.

04:25.938 --> 04:29.217
- Oh God.
- Okay, okay. Just... just chill.

04:29.242 --> 04:31.768
All right, we just got to stay
calm and work out this problem.

04:31.793 --> 04:35.468
- We'll figure it out, okay?
- Okay. Right.

04:36.731 --> 04:38.708
Well, whatever happened, it
happened during the stitch,

04:38.733 --> 04:40.966
so maybe it has something to do
with the case we're working on?

04:40.991 --> 04:42.640
Excellent. The only thing is,

04:42.665 --> 04:44.660
I just can't remember what that case is.

04:45.341 --> 04:47.245
Let's find out.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.293
- This can't be right.
- What?

04:55.318 --> 04:57.318
Our records say, our last
case was Jake Rowland.

04:57.343 --> 04:59.581
Jake Row... The murdered gamer?

04:59.606 --> 05:01.423
We closed that case, so whoever
came in and attacked us

05:01.448 --> 05:02.721
wiped the current case off the system?

05:02.746 --> 05:03.745
Wait.

05:04.635 --> 05:06.473
Listen.

05:07.341 --> 05:10.625
Listen? To what? I don't hear anything.

05:12.839 --> 05:14.856
- I...
- Shh!

05:16.040 --> 05:17.118
Who's there?

05:17.143 --> 05:19.461
Kirsten, I didn't...
I didn't hear anybody.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.453
- I feel like we're being watched.
- Okay, if there's one thing

05:21.488 --> 05:24.322
we do know, it's that
we're the only ones here.

05:25.962 --> 05:27.636
Let's go back to my house.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.427
Maybe Camille's there.

05:32.838 --> 05:34.754
Maggie...

05:37.193 --> 05:38.839
Camille?

05:42.469 --> 05:44.663
(gasps) Ow. It's really hot.

05:44.688 --> 05:46.500
Okay, well, maybe she left in a hurry.

05:46.525 --> 05:48.292
Or somebody just grabbed her.

05:48.317 --> 05:50.219
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

05:50.244 --> 05:52.250
We're figure this out. Okay?

05:52.790 --> 05:55.437
Please don't touch me. Not right now.

05:55.462 --> 05:57.362
Right. Sorry. I just thought,

05:57.387 --> 05:59.141
you know, we could both
use some comforting.

05:59.166 --> 06:01.369
Hm. Um, I'm gonna check
out Camille's room.

06:01.394 --> 06:03.527
Maybe she left a clue.

06:03.552 --> 06:05.318
Can you try the NSA again?

06:06.879 --> 06:08.906
Camille?

06:25.188 --> 06:26.954
Did you get through to the NSA?

06:26.979 --> 06:29.536
Um, more or less.

06:29.561 --> 06:31.430
In their less than helpful terms,

06:31.455 --> 06:35.258
they are aware of the situation.

06:35.283 --> 06:37.716
- Well, are we in danger?
- That's where it gets weird.

06:37.741 --> 06:41.087
They told us not to
worry and to stay put

06:41.112 --> 06:47.251
because... "Mother" is
looking out for us.

06:47.276 --> 06:50.914
Now, in NSA terms, I have
no idea what that means.

06:50.942 --> 06:54.696
It could be code for Maggie or
whoever picks our cases or...

06:54.729 --> 06:57.680
- My mother.
- There's still no way to be sure.

06:57.705 --> 07:00.094
So, did you find anything
in Camille's room?

07:00.119 --> 07:02.434
She has blackout curtains on her window

07:02.459 --> 07:05.015
that I don't remember
ever seeing before,

07:05.040 --> 07:07.564
but then again, there's a
lot I can't remember today.

07:07.589 --> 07:10.313
Look, I know the NSA told
us to stay put, but...

07:10.338 --> 07:12.471
There's stuff between us
that we haven't dealt with,

07:12.496 --> 07:15.360
and I'm... I'm not sure
I want to right now.

07:15.385 --> 07:17.900
I understand. That's...

07:19.064 --> 07:21.891
But, you know, if we have to stay put,

07:21.916 --> 07:23.983
then it makes sense
to stay put together.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.611
You sure?

07:26.642 --> 07:32.672
I have to admit this isn't the most
inspired penne I have ever made,

07:32.697 --> 07:36.795
but then again, your pantry is
also a foodie's worst nightmare.

07:36.820 --> 07:41.061
I know. It was Camille's
night to get groceries.

07:42.738 --> 07:45.545
Has anything come back to you from
before you woke up in the lab?

07:45.570 --> 07:49.381
(sighs) Nothing. Whatever gas they
used really did a number on me.

07:49.406 --> 07:50.443
Do you remember anything?

07:50.468 --> 07:53.562
No. And without knowing
the case, I have no idea

07:53.587 --> 07:55.030
what could be so important

07:55.055 --> 07:57.681
as to make an entire lab
full of people disappear.

07:57.706 --> 07:59.743
I keep thinking about what the NSA said.

07:59.768 --> 08:01.443
What if this is about my mother?

08:01.468 --> 08:03.232
Wouldn't we remember that?

08:03.375 --> 08:05.508
Well, but that's that the thing.

08:05.533 --> 08:09.632
I don't remember anything.
It's not even just a blur.

08:09.848 --> 08:11.616
It's just not there.

08:11.941 --> 08:16.123
I know, but, you know, it's
kind of out of our hands,

08:16.148 --> 08:18.358
until we hear from "Mother."

08:20.311 --> 08:23.079
You don't talk about your mother much.
Why is that?

08:23.114 --> 08:24.247
What do you wanna know?

08:24.282 --> 08:26.048
What was she like growing up?

08:27.318 --> 08:31.954
She was, um... She was
difficult to read.

08:31.990 --> 08:35.356
I knew she loved me, but I
could always sense the, uh,

08:35.381 --> 08:40.150
the pressure my condition gave
her, you know, the strain.

08:40.184 --> 08:41.443
I'd always wanna tell
her not to worry,

08:41.467 --> 08:42.638
but I just wouldn't
know what to say

08:42.663 --> 08:47.165
to make things better, so I was
frustrated a lot of the time.

08:49.163 --> 08:51.029
Well, how did you deal with it?

08:51.065 --> 08:54.099
I just worked through those
frustrations in other ways.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.236
Puzzles, thought experiments.

08:59.139 --> 09:03.308
Any problem that I could
figure out the solution to.

09:03.344 --> 09:05.078
But that didn't last long.

09:05.103 --> 09:07.644
After my dad left, my
mom met a man named Bill,

09:07.669 --> 09:10.224
and they were crazy about each other.

09:10.249 --> 09:13.667
But, um, Bill and I...
we didn't get along.

09:13.692 --> 09:16.870
And it was only a matter of time
until Bill wanted me out of there,

09:16.895 --> 09:20.543
so he gave my mom a choice
to send me away to school,

09:20.568 --> 09:22.458
or, you know, break up.

09:23.770 --> 09:25.982
God, Cameron, I had no idea.

09:26.061 --> 09:29.930
Honestly, it's totally fine.

09:29.955 --> 09:32.923
Actually, it feels good
to get that off my chest.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.915
Thank you for listening.

09:36.220 --> 09:38.285
Thanks for talking to me.

09:41.504 --> 09:42.768
(gasps)

09:42.803 --> 09:44.573
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

09:44.598 --> 09:48.433
No, no. I just think with
everything going on,

09:48.469 --> 09:50.457
it's probably... the less
touching, the better.

09:50.482 --> 09:52.895
Right. I don't want to confuse things.

09:54.871 --> 09:56.738
You know, I should go to sleep.

09:56.763 --> 10:00.051
I'm sure Camille won't mind
if you, uh, use her room.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.644
Wherever she is.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.646
Oh, blackout shades, score.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.505
Wake me if she gets home tonight?

10:06.530 --> 10:10.532
Ha. If the sound of Camille
kicking my ass out of her own bed

10:10.557 --> 10:13.217
isn't alarm enough, I will.

10:13.242 --> 10:14.923
Good night.

10:16.318 --> 10:17.851
Night.

10:25.745 --> 10:27.211
Cameron!

10:28.406 --> 10:30.963
- What is it?
- Someone is watching us.

10:36.291 --> 10:38.213
Ok. I just checked the porch.

10:38.245 --> 10:41.469
Long aside the house, out back...
I didn't see anyone.

10:41.494 --> 10:45.129
I swear, I saw a woman standing
right outside the window.

10:45.154 --> 10:47.299
She was looking in, and she...

10:47.324 --> 10:50.043
Wait. Do you think the NSA
sent someone to watch us?

10:50.068 --> 10:52.034
Was that... "Mother"?

10:52.059 --> 10:53.561
No. Okay, I think this is the latest

10:53.596 --> 10:56.322
in a series of aftereffects
from the knockout gas.

10:56.347 --> 10:58.799
You just need some rest.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.791
Our friends are missing,

11:00.816 --> 11:03.132
and I just saw someone
peeping on us from outside.

11:03.157 --> 11:05.023
Yes, I know that, but
you are very tired,

11:05.048 --> 11:06.484
and we are both very disoriented,

11:06.509 --> 11:08.916
so I think the best option
right now is to get some rest,

11:08.941 --> 11:12.556
and come at this with a clear
head in the morning. Okay?

11:14.323 --> 11:15.503
Okay.

11:15.528 --> 11:16.594
Okay.

11:16.619 --> 11:18.419
Wait.

11:18.454 --> 11:22.155
If you don't mind, could... could
you sleep in my room tonight?

11:22.180 --> 11:24.244
Like on the floor?

11:30.022 --> 11:31.889
- Are you awake?
- Hmm?

11:31.924 --> 11:33.385
Barely.

11:34.288 --> 11:35.888
What's up?

11:40.900 --> 11:42.866
I can't stop thinking about us.

11:42.902 --> 11:44.691
We've done so much together,

11:44.716 --> 11:46.501
it seems like we should know
everything there is to know

11:46.526 --> 11:50.664
about each other, but after hearing
you talk about your mother before,

11:50.689 --> 11:51.846
I'm not so sure about that.

11:51.871 --> 11:54.576
Speak for yourself. I think
I know you pretty well.

11:54.601 --> 11:57.814
Oh. Oh, yeah?

11:57.877 --> 11:59.225
What's my favorite movie?

11:59.250 --> 12:02.791
Mmm. (chuckles) Trick question.

12:02.816 --> 12:04.473
You don't have one.

12:04.498 --> 12:06.131
Now, good night.

12:07.956 --> 12:11.594
Well, when I was in middle
school, what sport did I play?

12:11.619 --> 12:13.478
And why did I quit?

12:13.503 --> 12:18.744
Basketball. Ed Clark wanted you
to try out because he thought

12:18.769 --> 12:20.502
it would help you be a team player,

12:20.527 --> 12:24.088
and even though you never
wanted to go, you didn't quit.

12:24.455 --> 12:26.432
Until they kicked you off the team.

12:26.467 --> 12:29.668
Which was ridiculous because
I was the best player.

12:29.703 --> 12:33.250
Maybe, but if the best
player on the team

12:33.275 --> 12:35.307
suffers from
temporal dysplasia

12:35.342 --> 12:37.733
and has no
perception of time,

12:37.758 --> 12:40.179
you tend to get a lot of
shot clock violations.

12:40.204 --> 12:43.366
Okay, I'm really goin' to sleep now.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.392
Okay, when I was
a little girl,

12:49.417 --> 12:51.756
I broke a bone, and I
never saw a doctor,

12:51.781 --> 12:54.451
because I was too embarrassed
to tell anyone how I did it.

12:54.476 --> 12:55.945
Which bone did I break?

12:55.970 --> 12:58.422
Right foot, please.

13:00.816 --> 13:04.084
Oh, my, gosh.

13:04.109 --> 13:06.787
This little piggy.

13:07.140 --> 13:09.367
You got so excited
when you heard

13:09.392 --> 13:11.382
the ice cream truck
comin' down the street,

13:11.407 --> 13:14.805
you sprinted towards the door
and stubbed it on a chair.

13:15.087 --> 13:17.878
I never told you that.
How did you know that?

13:18.276 --> 13:20.216
Cameron?

13:36.150 --> 13:37.750
Cameron?

13:42.163 --> 13:44.063
Cameron?

13:44.088 --> 13:45.633
- Oh!
- Ooh!

13:45.658 --> 13:48.251
Ooh. Oh. Ahh, sorry.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.261
You okay?

13:49.286 --> 13:51.726
Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm fine, I just...

13:51.751 --> 13:53.649
I... I woke up, and you weren't
in bed, you were gone,

13:53.674 --> 13:57.204
and I... (sighs) I thought maybe...

13:57.229 --> 13:59.162
You miss me?

13:59.187 --> 14:00.754
I take it Camille didn't come home?

14:00.779 --> 14:03.425
No, I haven't been able
to get hold of anyone.

14:03.450 --> 14:06.095
- Nothing from the NSA?
- Nada.

14:06.456 --> 14:08.651
Okay, well, I don't
know about you, but

14:08.676 --> 14:10.449
I can't sit on my
hands much longer.

14:12.307 --> 14:14.028
Hello?

14:15.569 --> 14:18.287
Okay, well, it doesn't look like
anyone's been here since we left.

14:18.312 --> 14:20.078
And whose is that?

14:20.113 --> 14:22.180
Is that the same coffee cup
that was here yesterday?

14:22.215 --> 14:23.983
No. It's still hot.

14:24.008 --> 14:25.427
Someone made this recently.

14:25.452 --> 14:27.842
Okay, we're being mucked with
and I don't like being mucked.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.600
- This doesn't make any sense.
- (cup rattles)

14:30.625 --> 14:31.882
What was that?

14:32.055 --> 14:33.999
Hold on.

14:36.288 --> 14:38.121
(rattling)

14:41.590 --> 14:44.800
What the hell?

14:45.920 --> 14:47.653
What's "Euro"?

14:47.678 --> 14:49.598
I have no idea.

14:53.568 --> 14:55.402
- Wait.
- What?

14:55.437 --> 14:56.703
There's something in the static.

14:57.806 --> 15:01.131
- What is that?
- It looks like a face?

15:01.743 --> 15:03.476
There's another one.

15:03.512 --> 15:05.887
Is there any way to bring the
image out of the static?

15:05.912 --> 15:09.411
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I have
an idea. I can rig something up.

15:09.436 --> 15:10.779
Great. How long will it take?

15:10.804 --> 15:13.971
It's a 30-minute job,
I'll be done in 10.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.535
Okay, I'll look
around the lab

15:15.560 --> 15:17.419
and see if there's
anything else that's...

15:17.444 --> 15:20.045
been moved around or changed.

15:39.702 --> 15:41.402
Cameron?

15:41.427 --> 15:43.484
I found something!

15:45.773 --> 15:47.488
Cameron?

15:59.779 --> 16:01.669
Cameron?

16:15.889 --> 16:17.492
This is pretty cool, huh?

16:17.518 --> 16:18.991
For a Deadmau5 show.

16:19.016 --> 16:20.916
Deadmau5 wishes he were this cool.

16:20.951 --> 16:23.051
All right, question for you.

16:23.076 --> 16:25.443
Why couldn't we make out
those images on the monitor?

16:26.474 --> 16:27.821
They were too faint,

16:27.846 --> 16:30.580
and there was a static
blizzard over them?

16:30.605 --> 16:32.672
Well, that's when they were under
our boring old white lights.

16:32.727 --> 16:34.827
If we hit them with
the right color light

16:34.852 --> 16:38.205
and frequency, we can make
all those hidden images pop

16:38.230 --> 16:40.567
and send all that unwanted
noise to the background.

16:40.592 --> 16:43.544
- Man of science.
- Well...

16:48.728 --> 16:52.066
- I don't see anything.
- A moment.

16:56.174 --> 17:01.295
Kirsten: Sad. Happy. Surprised.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.669
- Confused...
- These are for people with autism

17:04.694 --> 17:07.395
to understand emotions. I
used to have flash cards

17:07.420 --> 17:09.819
just like this when I was a little
girl with temporal dysplasia.

17:09.976 --> 17:12.545
Interesting. And they would be
on our monitors because...?

17:12.569 --> 17:15.617
Maybe "Mother" is trying
to send a message to us.

17:21.813 --> 17:23.351
What are you doing?

17:23.376 --> 17:25.743
I saw something else. It
was a shape of some kind,

17:25.769 --> 17:27.568
but it's a different color.

17:44.673 --> 17:47.228
And the mucking continues.

17:53.199 --> 17:55.120
What is that doing in your hand?

17:55.145 --> 17:56.278
What was this doing in your locker?

17:56.313 --> 17:57.879
You think I had something
to do with all of this?

17:57.904 --> 17:59.258
At this point, I don't know anything.

17:59.283 --> 18:01.183
What is a key doing in a coffee cup?

18:01.218 --> 18:03.090
What is a face doing hidden
in static on these monitors?

18:03.115 --> 18:05.284
Kirsten, I don't understand
any of this, either,

18:05.309 --> 18:07.920
but I've been by your
side this whole time.

18:07.945 --> 18:09.845
You know me!

18:11.835 --> 18:13.846
Hold this.

18:14.502 --> 18:15.970
Where are you going?

18:17.055 --> 18:18.621
To finish the puzzle?

18:18.656 --> 18:20.432
Should I get your stitch suit?

18:20.892 --> 18:23.102
We're all adults here.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.669
Puzzle piece?

18:56.828 --> 18:58.961
So what does it mean?

18:58.997 --> 19:02.021
- Why you askin' me?
- You're the kid that grew up

19:02.046 --> 19:04.013
doing puzzles and thought experiments.

19:04.038 --> 19:05.242
What does it mean?

19:05.267 --> 19:07.915
Challenge accepted.

19:17.093 --> 19:20.381
(laughs) You gotta see this.

19:20.406 --> 19:21.535
Are you 12 years old?

19:21.560 --> 19:23.620
I mean the puzzle, you perv.

19:23.645 --> 19:25.330
Oh.

19:27.993 --> 19:29.562
Good thinking, Goodkin.

19:29.587 --> 19:31.336
I thought so, too.

19:33.799 --> 19:36.866
- 5-9-1-5.
- Gelson Street.

19:36.891 --> 19:39.476
Maybe the answer to
all of this is there.

19:39.501 --> 19:41.167
But what if it's a trap?

19:41.192 --> 19:44.427
Well, if it's a trap, then
that's the answer, too.

19:48.984 --> 19:50.843
No one cars outside.

19:50.869 --> 19:52.132
No one inside the house.

19:52.157 --> 19:54.066
Okay, what are we supposed to find?

19:54.091 --> 19:55.700
Well, I know that
everything today

19:55.725 --> 19:57.268
is a riddle stuffed
in an enigma,

19:57.293 --> 20:00.227
wrapped in a mystery, but I
really can't see anything in here

20:00.252 --> 20:02.052
worth investigating.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.894
I can think of one thing.

20:06.309 --> 20:10.978
One seriously badass vintage thing.

20:11.014 --> 20:12.921
Oh my gosh.

20:13.451 --> 20:15.733
Okay, it's not a Hot Wheel.

20:15.758 --> 20:20.974
All right, don't be so naive. Toys
come in all shapes, sizes and prices.

20:20.999 --> 20:25.062
- So what kind of toy is this?
- This? Oh, this, this is a '65 Falcon,

20:25.087 --> 20:26.290
and I used to be obsessed,

20:26.315 --> 20:28.436
and I mean obsessed with
this car when I was a kid.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.595
But my mom always said it
was too dangerous. So...

20:31.620 --> 20:34.796
Hmm. You're a car guy. Another
Cameron factoid I did not know.

20:34.821 --> 20:36.788
Looks like it's had some
work done since its day,

20:36.813 --> 20:39.802
but I bet this thing still purrs
like a Manx and roars like a lion.

20:39.827 --> 20:41.155
Oh my gosh,

20:41.180 --> 20:43.749
what I wouldn't give to have a
night on the town with her.

20:43.774 --> 20:46.078
Eww, to all of that.

20:46.103 --> 20:48.069
Hey, it's too bad we don't have a key.

20:48.095 --> 20:50.064
Can you imagine
just you and me,

20:50.089 --> 20:52.964
rollin' down Mulholland in
this thing, wind in our hair,

20:52.989 --> 20:55.094
(sputtering)

20:56.829 --> 20:58.452
Actually, I think we do.

20:58.477 --> 21:00.043
Hmm?

21:00.107 --> 21:02.584
Kirsten: It doesn't say
"Euro," it says "Ford."

21:02.609 --> 21:04.721
It's so old the engraving's
been rubbed down.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.837
Okay, I'm just gonna ignore
how seriously weird this is,

21:07.862 --> 21:11.478
and just keep embracing how
seriously awesome this is.

21:13.239 --> 21:15.062
Why, thank you.

21:25.150 --> 21:27.818
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Safety first.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.987
We're not taking this
car out for a spin.

21:30.022 --> 21:30.850
Huh?

21:30.875 --> 21:33.630
Somebody led us, step by step,
from the lab to this car,

21:33.655 --> 21:35.222
there must be a reason why.

21:35.255 --> 21:37.455
We gotta take a look around, and
see if we can figure it out.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.246
Okay, okay.

21:43.014 --> 21:44.758
Huh.

21:46.251 --> 21:48.513
Any other day, that would be odd.

21:48.830 --> 21:51.631
There's no registration or insurance.

21:51.656 --> 21:54.194
Maybe it's inoperable.

21:55.182 --> 21:57.816
(car starts)

21:57.841 --> 22:01.162
(chuckles) So much for that theory.

22:01.944 --> 22:04.812
(pop song playing over radio)

22:14.722 --> 22:16.566
Why won't it shut off?

22:16.591 --> 22:17.833
It's just got a
faulty ignition switch.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.255
Try again.

22:23.530 --> 22:25.564
We need to get the garage door open.

22:25.599 --> 22:27.425
Okay.

22:29.717 --> 22:31.817
(grunts)

22:32.600 --> 22:34.239
It's locked.

22:34.339 --> 22:36.306
Front door.

22:36.331 --> 22:39.542
- Let's try this one.
- (coughing)

22:40.407 --> 22:42.140
Here, let me try. Let me try.

22:42.165 --> 22:43.612
What the hell?

22:43.637 --> 22:46.100
(coughing) -It's locked
from the outside. Damn it!

22:46.125 --> 22:48.515
Okay, look for something heavy
like a hammer or a hatchet,

22:48.540 --> 22:50.673
something that we can break
down this door with!

22:50.698 --> 22:52.464
Right.

22:52.489 --> 22:54.049
(coughs)

22:55.854 --> 22:58.315
God, this box is just full of puzzles.

22:59.805 --> 23:03.408
- Oh, my God, I'm getting nauseous.
- (Kirsten coughs)

23:05.155 --> 23:08.651
(Cameron grunting)

23:10.690 --> 23:13.558
(grunts, coughs)

23:13.583 --> 23:15.130
Here, let me try.

23:15.155 --> 23:17.259
- Let me try.
- (coughing)

23:18.241 --> 23:20.816
- (coughs)
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

23:20.841 --> 23:23.008
(coughing)

23:25.360 --> 23:28.369
(grunts, coughs)

23:28.394 --> 23:30.174
Cameron, I need your help.

23:30.199 --> 23:31.861
(coughing)

23:31.886 --> 23:33.060
(wood splintering)

23:33.085 --> 23:34.118
Cameron?

23:34.143 --> 23:35.175
(coughs)

23:35.200 --> 23:37.083
Cameron, you all right?

23:38.526 --> 23:40.439
Cameron!

23:42.322 --> 23:44.649
- Okay, I just wanna sleep.
- No! You can do this.

23:44.674 --> 23:47.166
(coughs) You can do this.

23:47.191 --> 23:48.516
Look at me, you can do this.

23:48.541 --> 23:50.741
I know you. You can do this.

23:50.776 --> 23:52.299
Okay? Come on.

23:52.324 --> 23:54.100
Come on.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.209
(both panting)

23:57.234 --> 23:58.400
Okay, ready?

23:58.425 --> 23:59.424
Go!

23:59.449 --> 24:02.317
(grunting)

24:02.342 --> 24:05.010
Okay, on the count of three, come on.

24:05.035 --> 24:07.068
- One.
- Two.

24:07.093 --> 24:09.483
(grunts)

24:11.438 --> 24:13.579
- (coughing)
- That is not how I thought my first time in classic car

24:13.604 --> 24:15.128
- would go.
- How are you feeling?

24:15.153 --> 24:18.529
I'm a little better now that
I've had some fresh air.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.187
- How about you?
- Actually, I feel kind of the same way

24:21.212 --> 24:22.924
as I did when I woke up in the lab.

24:22.949 --> 24:24.181
That could be something.

24:24.206 --> 24:25.838
What do you think?

24:25.863 --> 24:29.107
I think that our lungs are
full of fumes from a car

24:29.132 --> 24:31.698
that probably hasn't had an
oil change in my lifetime,

24:31.723 --> 24:33.354
that we don't know
where our friends are,

24:33.379 --> 24:36.478
that we haven't eaten anything beyond
simple carbs in over 36 hours,

24:36.503 --> 24:38.853
and it's been even
longer since I showered.

24:39.016 --> 24:40.916
- (sniffs)
- Mm.

24:40.941 --> 24:44.213
Yeah. Yeah, why don't you go shower.
I'll make us some food.

24:44.246 --> 24:45.791
Any requests?

24:45.816 --> 24:47.945
Surprise me!

24:58.832 --> 25:00.854
Oh my gosh!

25:01.269 --> 25:02.300
Kirsten...

25:02.325 --> 25:04.840
Cameron! That is not what
I meant by "Surprise me"!

25:04.865 --> 25:07.453
Look, I know things have been kind
of confusing the last few days,

25:07.478 --> 25:09.275
for a lot of reasons,
but, you know,

25:09.300 --> 25:10.567
they haven't changed
things between us.

25:10.615 --> 25:11.857
What are you talkin' about?

25:11.882 --> 25:13.516
I'm still not ready
for us to be together.

25:13.541 --> 25:15.359
Okay, now that you've
gotten that off your chest,

25:15.384 --> 25:17.083
can I tell you what I
came here to tell you?

25:17.108 --> 25:19.476
You know how we thought the
garage was a dead end?

25:19.501 --> 25:21.162
We were wrong.

25:23.937 --> 25:27.809
I can usually solve one of these
things in under a minute,

25:27.834 --> 25:28.700
but not this one.

25:28.725 --> 25:30.625
- So you've lost your touch?
- Hardly.

25:30.650 --> 25:32.127
Contrary to popular belief,

25:32.152 --> 25:33.581
these things are actually
pretty easy to solve,

25:33.606 --> 25:34.880
if you know what patterns to look for.

25:34.905 --> 25:36.848
You got six sides, nine squares on each.

25:36.873 --> 25:39.038
So the only way to make this
truly impossible to solve,

25:39.063 --> 25:40.830
is by deliberately switching
one of the squares.

25:40.855 --> 25:42.722
Which is exactly what's
been done to this cube.

25:42.747 --> 25:44.080
It's an unsolvable Rubik's cube.

25:44.138 --> 25:46.672
Oh, yet another in a
long stream of puzzles.

25:46.697 --> 25:49.098
I really wish someone would
just tell us what's going on.

25:49.123 --> 25:51.023
(sighs)

25:52.012 --> 25:55.151
You know, honestly? Working
out these clues with you

25:55.176 --> 26:00.446
over the last two days hasn't
been the worst time of my life.

26:01.216 --> 26:04.918
Missing friends and near-death
experiences aside, of course?

26:04.943 --> 26:05.848
(laughs) Yeah, of course, but...

26:05.873 --> 26:07.395
I don't know, I just feel
like it's been a while

26:07.419 --> 26:11.488
since we've gotten to work this
closely together, that's all.

26:11.513 --> 26:14.582
Yeah. You're right, it has been.

26:17.763 --> 26:19.429
I've missed it.

26:25.244 --> 26:26.737
Oh my God, that's it.

26:26.772 --> 26:29.399
- What? What's it?
- What if somebody's deliberately

26:29.424 --> 26:31.323
pushing us together, just us?

26:31.360 --> 26:33.072
By forcing us to rely on each other,

26:33.097 --> 26:36.135
we'd have to get over our baggage
and be a more effective team.

26:36.160 --> 26:40.069
So you think this is some sort of
Tony Robbins-meets-Jigsaw operation

26:40.094 --> 26:41.193
put on by the NSA?

26:41.218 --> 26:43.351
No, no, not the NSA.

26:43.567 --> 26:45.600
Can we actually get dinner to go?

26:45.625 --> 26:47.517
Uh...

26:53.575 --> 26:57.129
Looks like we were paid another
visit from the Clue Fairy.

26:57.154 --> 26:58.495
Now he's just messing with us.

26:58.520 --> 26:59.442
Or she.

26:59.467 --> 27:02.445
No. He.

27:02.470 --> 27:06.104
Who is the one person that we know
whose tactics are this extreme,

27:06.129 --> 27:08.176
and who wants us to keep stitching?

27:08.201 --> 27:09.154
My father.

27:09.179 --> 27:11.575
The NSA told us that "Mother"
is looking out for us.

27:11.599 --> 27:12.553
I really think
that's our lead.

27:12.578 --> 27:14.284
Oh, was "Mother"
looking out for us

27:14.310 --> 27:15.817
when we got trapped and
nearly died in the garage?

27:15.842 --> 27:17.561
We don't even know
if she exists

27:17.586 --> 27:20.438
or if she's just some
NSA stalling technique.

27:20.463 --> 27:24.755
But we do know Stinger, and this
has his fingerprints all over it.

27:24.780 --> 27:26.356
Kirsten, this is not about Stinger.

27:26.381 --> 27:28.028
How can you be so sure?

27:31.832 --> 27:34.733
You were the only one
left when I bounced.

27:34.758 --> 27:36.292
Why weren't you taken?

27:36.332 --> 27:38.590
What are you talking about?

27:39.083 --> 27:40.817
Are you and Maggie
and the NSA doing

27:40.842 --> 27:42.785
this to get me to
trust you again?

27:42.810 --> 27:44.195
Work with you? Forgive you?

27:44.220 --> 27:45.986
Listen to yourself,
you're being ridiculous!

27:46.011 --> 27:48.114
Why? Because you say so?

27:48.139 --> 27:49.705
Why should I trust you?

27:49.730 --> 27:50.995
Because you know me.

27:51.020 --> 27:53.057
Do I?

27:53.536 --> 27:54.420
This was a mistake.

27:54.445 --> 27:55.163
What?

27:55.188 --> 27:57.419
This. This whole
thing with you and me,

27:57.444 --> 27:58.647
it's like my whole life,

27:58.672 --> 28:00.421
no matter how hard I try to
make connections with people,

28:00.446 --> 28:03.390
it just... it just never works out.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.683
Cameron, what are you talking about?

28:06.242 --> 28:08.278
You're one of the most
outgoing people I know.

28:08.303 --> 28:10.356
You've never had problems
connecting with anyone.

28:10.381 --> 28:12.194
- Wait.
- Huh?

28:12.219 --> 28:15.943
Hold on, what if... What if these
monitors are puzzle pieces,

28:15.968 --> 28:18.105
like... like they're clues or something?

28:18.130 --> 28:21.398
If we... we rearranged these, we can...

28:22.809 --> 28:24.326
Okay, I'll help.

28:24.351 --> 28:29.582
Actually... I just think we'd
do better working alone.

28:30.185 --> 28:33.333
Sure. Okay.

28:41.049 --> 28:44.314
Another clue? Great.

28:45.287 --> 28:47.183
Okay.

28:48.439 --> 28:54.150
What is the last case we worked on?

28:55.220 --> 28:59.155
Jake Rowland. Tell me
something I don't know.

29:01.572 --> 29:08.455
What is the current
case we're working on?

29:12.040 --> 29:14.907
- Tom Dewitt.
- Tom De-who?

29:14.932 --> 29:16.056
Tom Dewitt.

29:16.081 --> 29:19.539
Severely autistic man in his
20s, found dead in his garage.

29:19.564 --> 29:22.142
Suicide. Car exhaust inhalation.

29:22.167 --> 29:24.134
He was also an empath.

29:24.159 --> 29:25.526
His brain was wired in a way

29:25.551 --> 29:27.438
that meant he could feel the
depth of other people's

29:27.463 --> 29:28.353
emotional states.

29:28.378 --> 29:30.500
I'm confused. A new case came in?

29:30.521 --> 29:33.809
No. Not a new case. Tom
is our current case.

29:33.838 --> 29:36.197
- I thought that file was deleted.
- Well, that's what you said,

29:36.223 --> 29:38.924
but I didn't have a chance to
check for myself until now.

29:38.949 --> 29:40.056
Oh, so now you're calling me a liar.

29:40.081 --> 29:43.073
No. I'm saying that...

29:45.621 --> 29:47.703
You're not real.

29:50.290 --> 29:53.837
Okay, Kirsten. It's been a long day,
huh, maybe it's time we call it?

29:53.862 --> 29:55.439
No, no, no. You don't understand.

29:55.464 --> 29:57.921
I'm stitched into Tom right now.

29:57.946 --> 30:00.391
You're right. I don't understand

30:00.416 --> 30:03.844
because that is
metaphysically impossible.

30:03.869 --> 30:07.216
If we are stitched into Tom right now,

30:07.241 --> 30:09.226
how have we spent the last two days

30:09.251 --> 30:10.689
traveling back and
forth across the city?

30:10.714 --> 30:11.714
Have we, though?

30:11.739 --> 30:14.127
Because to me, it feels like
we talk about going somewhere

30:14.151 --> 30:16.235
and then all of a sudden,
we're just... there.

30:16.261 --> 30:18.929
Like jumping between different
memories in a stitch.

30:18.954 --> 30:22.017
Do you remember actually traveling
to the places we've been?

30:22.042 --> 30:24.439
- Yeah, of course I do.
- Really?

30:24.464 --> 30:29.494
So, what was the traffic like, and
what was on the radio in the car?

30:29.948 --> 30:33.196
See? You can't remember, because
it didn't actually happen!

30:33.221 --> 30:34.915
How could Tom have this memory?

30:34.940 --> 30:38.477
Just you and me, arguing on the
floor, of a secret NSA facility?

30:38.589 --> 30:41.290
That's exactly what I'm getting at.
By stitching into Tom,

30:41.315 --> 30:43.582
we must've opened up a pathway
into his empath abilities.

30:43.607 --> 30:47.344
So, instead of objectively
seeing his memories,

30:47.369 --> 30:53.931
I'm experiencing them through a
filter of... my emotional state.

30:53.956 --> 30:56.548
Nothing that's happened in the
past two days has been real.

30:56.573 --> 30:58.696
Including me.

30:58.893 --> 31:00.876
Including you.

31:00.901 --> 31:03.642
You're a reflection of
my feelings about us.

31:03.667 --> 31:05.641
So I'm your imaginary friend.

31:05.666 --> 31:09.159
No. No, no. You're more
like my projected friend.

31:10.515 --> 31:12.361
Wait here.

31:20.738 --> 31:22.538
Cameron?

31:28.983 --> 31:31.683
- Now take this.
- What? No!

31:31.708 --> 31:33.141
Take it!

31:35.143 --> 31:36.850
- Cameron.
- Now shoot me.

31:36.875 --> 31:38.233
Cameron. Stop it.

31:38.259 --> 31:39.258
What are you so worried about?

31:39.283 --> 31:40.796
If I'm a figment of your imagination...

31:40.821 --> 31:42.366
- Yeah, I know, but...
- Do it. Pull the trigger.

31:42.391 --> 31:43.835
- No!
- Am I real or not?

31:43.860 --> 31:46.358
- Stop!
- Am I real or not?

31:46.383 --> 31:48.115
You're not real!

31:53.968 --> 31:56.068
But that doesn't mean that I
could watch something happen

31:56.093 --> 31:58.913
to even my projected version of you.
I care about you.

31:58.938 --> 32:00.422
I never stopped
caring about you,

32:00.447 --> 32:02.538
and even though I
know this isn't real,

32:02.563 --> 32:06.647
I can't stand the thought of
losing you and it being my fault.

32:07.985 --> 32:10.858
I guess that means you love me.

32:17.212 --> 32:19.297
(gunshot)

32:19.322 --> 32:20.867
Cameron!

32:20.892 --> 32:23.051
God!

32:23.721 --> 32:26.588
(whimpers)

32:29.656 --> 32:33.703
Cameron? Talk to me.

32:35.578 --> 32:39.248
Oh... God, no!

32:42.904 --> 32:44.211
Oh my God.

32:44.606 --> 32:45.739
Oh.

32:47.254 --> 32:49.418
It's a stitch! I knew it, oh my God!

32:49.443 --> 32:50.953
I knew it, it's a stitch!

32:50.978 --> 32:52.803
I'm in a stitch!

32:52.827 --> 32:55.673
Cameron! I know I'm
stitched into Tom Dewitt!

32:55.698 --> 32:56.731
Can you hear me?

32:56.756 --> 32:59.790
I don't know how I've
been in here for so long.

32:59.815 --> 33:01.588
But I... I... I think
that something about

33:01.613 --> 33:03.389
Tom's autistic brain pattern

33:03.414 --> 33:05.646
has me isolated in this stitch, so...

33:05.671 --> 33:10.967
so, God! I hope you can hear me,
because I... I can't hear you.

33:11.027 --> 33:15.617
And I'm... And I'm... all alone in here.

33:25.181 --> 33:27.222
I'm so sorry, Tom.

33:27.387 --> 33:28.929
Cameron...

33:30.070 --> 33:32.593
I'm gonna make the bounce.

33:40.311 --> 33:42.582
Jake.

33:47.340 --> 33:49.194
Coco Soo?

33:53.798 --> 33:55.909
Jamie B?

34:08.098 --> 34:11.817
I wanna speak for Tom, the
same way I spoke for you all,

34:11.842 --> 34:13.542
but I...

34:16.889 --> 34:18.889
I can't do it alone.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.418
Yes, you can, Kirsten.

34:24.444 --> 34:26.377
Ed.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.362
Tom needs you.

34:29.621 --> 34:32.405
But I don't understand
how his mind works.

34:32.429 --> 34:35.364
His focus, his... empathy.

34:35.389 --> 34:37.366
Well, you can't give up.

34:37.391 --> 34:38.731
Not now.

34:39.603 --> 34:44.998
Tom is the most... silent of us all.

35:03.524 --> 35:05.312
Nine squares.

35:10.652 --> 35:13.779
Nine monitors.

35:15.056 --> 35:18.418
Cameron... I'm not bouncing yet.

35:18.443 --> 35:20.761
I think I've figured it out.

35:20.786 --> 35:26.332
The images on each monitor are
all part of one big puzzle.

35:26.441 --> 35:29.376
They were deliberately separated,

35:29.401 --> 35:31.885
but if I arrange
them just right,

35:31.910 --> 35:34.675
they might tell me something.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.153
So, Cameron, if
this is all a stitch,

35:37.178 --> 35:39.738
then all the
conversations we had

35:39.763 --> 35:42.503
weren't really between us.

35:42.528 --> 35:46.397
Tom's memories are clearly
mixing with my emotional state.

35:46.422 --> 35:49.898
Anything that felt out of the
ordinary coming from you,

35:49.923 --> 35:52.801
must've been coming from Tom.

35:54.693 --> 35:56.787
Which means that the
story you told me

35:56.812 --> 36:00.058
about your mom and her
boyfriend Bill...

36:00.083 --> 36:03.191
didn't happen to you,
it happened to Tom.

36:03.216 --> 36:05.318
The blackout curtains
in Camille's room,

36:05.343 --> 36:07.291
the way you didn't
wanna be touched

36:07.316 --> 36:10.471
when we were having dinner, how
you felt like you had trouble

36:10.495 --> 36:13.879
connecting with people, all
of that was a part of the way

36:13.904 --> 36:16.425
that Tom experienced
life as an autistic man.

36:16.450 --> 36:17.683
And the puzzles.

36:17.708 --> 36:20.308
He was so overstimulated and...
overwhelmed,

36:20.333 --> 36:24.660
he needed them to focus, to
feel like he had control.

36:25.190 --> 36:29.363
- (popcorn popping)
- (microwave dings)

36:32.372 --> 36:35.943
Oh! Heat sensitivity...

36:35.968 --> 36:37.036
That's Tom, too.

36:37.061 --> 36:39.575
So "Mother" must've been Tom's mother.

36:39.611 --> 36:43.368
He knew that she would
always look after him.

36:44.419 --> 36:46.950
But who killed Tom?

36:54.565 --> 36:58.166
Let's see if I'm right.

37:10.051 --> 37:12.188
Maybe I was wrong.

37:16.061 --> 37:18.320
Is that an eye?

37:19.548 --> 37:22.298
Maybe it's a face.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.069
Cameron?

37:24.094 --> 37:26.619
I think it's a face!

38:38.934 --> 38:40.934
I know that face.

38:40.959 --> 38:43.606
I know that face!

38:54.422 --> 38:58.158
(beeping)

39:00.515 --> 39:01.914
Cameron: Kirsten!

39:01.939 --> 39:03.875
Fisher: Is she okay?

39:03.900 --> 39:05.751
Kirsten, what happened?

39:05.776 --> 39:10.055
I solved it! It took
days, but I solved it!

39:10.080 --> 39:11.733
Congrats, Linus, you did it.

39:11.758 --> 39:12.672
What did I do?

39:12.697 --> 39:15.312
You finally broke Kirsten.

39:18.385 --> 39:23.227
Okay. Bill Kurland killed Tom Dewitt.

39:23.252 --> 39:27.482
Uh... this Bill Kurland,
Tom's mother's boyfriend?

39:27.507 --> 39:28.383
That's the one.

39:28.408 --> 39:29.651
LAPD already questioned Kurland.

39:29.676 --> 39:31.078
He was at work at the time of death.

39:31.104 --> 39:33.421
That's because, before he left for work,

39:33.446 --> 39:36.016
Bill locked Tom in
the garage, and...

39:36.041 --> 39:37.718
and started the
engine to his old car.

39:37.743 --> 39:39.909
Are you sure Tom didn't
start the car himself?

39:39.945 --> 39:43.913
Positive. His mom kept that key in an...
in an old coffee cup,

39:43.949 --> 39:46.893
specifically, so that nothing
like this would ever happen.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.652
And Tom had a
heat sensitivity.

39:48.677 --> 39:50.531
He'd never touch a coffee
cup, no matter what.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.767
Why didn't he just leave
the car or the garage?

39:52.792 --> 39:55.227
Because he was obsessed with puzzles.

39:55.252 --> 39:57.150
Bill gave him a Rubik's cube

39:57.175 --> 39:58.834
that had been tampered with
so that he'd be so focused

39:58.859 --> 40:01.560
on trying to solve it, he'd asphyxiate

40:01.585 --> 40:03.820
without screaming or calling out.

40:03.845 --> 40:07.380
And even if he did come to, Bill
locked the door from the outside.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.625
Okay, but why?

40:08.650 --> 40:11.125
Because he was in love with Tom's mom.

40:11.150 --> 40:12.869
But she was so devoted to Tom

40:12.894 --> 40:14.585
that it was destroying
their relationship.

40:14.610 --> 40:16.126
By killing Tom,

40:16.151 --> 40:19.641
Bill thought that he was freeing
his mother from the burden.

40:19.666 --> 40:22.754
- Fisher, go get Bill Kurland.
- Yes, ma'am.

40:28.191 --> 40:30.157
We did it, Tom.

40:30.182 --> 40:32.916
You and I, together.

40:32.941 --> 40:35.769
Thank you for talkin' to me.

40:38.140 --> 40:39.206
Are you okay?

40:39.231 --> 40:40.530
Yeah.

40:40.568 --> 40:42.413
(sighs)

40:42.814 --> 40:44.736
I'm sorry, I...
You must've been

40:44.761 --> 40:47.172
so worried about
me that whole time.

40:47.756 --> 40:52.663
- Worried about what?
- Well, I was in the stitch for days.

40:52.688 --> 40:55.446
You weren't afraid I
wasn't gonna bounce?

40:55.471 --> 40:59.331
Kirsten, you were only in
there for three seconds.

41:04.605 --> 41:06.589
(sighs)

41:07.275 --> 41:09.842
Well, I guess that was
all the time I needed.

41:10.239 --> 41:11.969
For what?

41:14.023 --> 41:15.909
For this.
