WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
next bit. Bachelorette is next and
Lisa

00:00.000 --> 00:06.960
next bit. Bachelorette is next and
Lisa is

00:06.960 --> 00:09.560
OSHER:
Previously on The Bachelorette...

00:09.560 --> 00:12.320
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready to make history?

00:12.320 --> 00:15.080
To real love in all forms.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.280
..Brooke's love story began...

00:17.280 --> 00:19.280
This is a perfect moment.
Enjoy.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.280
BROOKE: Send down that limo.
OK.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.320
..as men and women
laid their hearts on the line.

00:24.320 --> 00:27.960
Oh! That gave me goosebumps.
I'm in real trouble.

00:27.960 --> 00:31.160
But a familiar face...
Oh, my...

00:31.160 --> 00:34.000
Oh, my God.
I'm so excited that you're here.
Me too.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.520
..sent ripples through the mansion...

00:36.520 --> 00:38.320
You've been on this show before,
though, haven't you?

00:38.320 --> 00:40.800
Yeah. I was on Brooke's season.
Oh! Inside track.

00:40.800 --> 00:41.800
(LAUGHS)

00:41.800 --> 00:43.240
Come in.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.720
..as friendship went further...

00:44.720 --> 00:47.560
I didn't know
if you felt the same way about me.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.000
..before
a small piece of furniture...

00:52.000 --> 00:55.240
I would love to get a moment
on the love seat with Brooke.

00:55.240 --> 00:57.600
..erupted into a game of thrones.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.080
(GASPS) No!
Oh, my God. She's doing it.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.320
Oh, my God! She did not.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.400
She did not.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.200
KONRAD: You are kidding me.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.640
Tonight...

01:05.640 --> 01:07.960
Today's group date is a photo shoot.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.280
(CHEERING)

01:09.280 --> 01:13.040
Everyone strives for picture-perfect.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.360
(WOMEN SQUEAL)
Ugh!

01:14.360 --> 01:16.200
And history repeats.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.000
Like, can you...scooch over?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.960
You gonna push me out of the seat?
Yeah.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.920
RYAN:
Taking the love seat once again.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.880
But this time,
Konrad won't back down.

01:24.880 --> 01:27.400
Go big.
You know, you got nothing to lose.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.600
But it's Holly...
Are you wanting a kiss?

01:30.600 --> 01:32.360
..that sees sparks fly...

01:32.360 --> 01:33.960
Oh, my God!

01:33.960 --> 01:36.160
..before a controversial move...

01:36.160 --> 01:38.600
My initial reaction is, "Dick."

01:38.600 --> 01:41.040
..backfires spectacularly.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.240
I'm no longer trusting you.
That is what it is.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.360
What is everyone's
first impression of Brooke?

01:52.360 --> 01:53.920
She what you were expecting?

01:53.920 --> 01:55.960
A lot more than I was expecting.
100%.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.520
Agreed.
She's insane.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.520
Keen to sort of find out
more about her, but she's definitely

02:00.520 --> 02:02.080
sort of what I was hoping for.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.960
Yeah.
No, she's super-cool.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.440
JAMIE-LEE: Everyone's so into Brooke,

02:05.440 --> 02:08.120
but having both males and females
in the house is...

02:08.120 --> 02:09.440
..it's uncharted waters.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.680
It's exciting.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.240
But I think it's gonna be so intense.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.720
We want time with Brooke!

02:13.720 --> 02:15.320
Yeah, I def...I definitely...
Go away!

02:15.320 --> 02:19.480
I think it's so awesome
that there's both male and females

02:19.480 --> 02:22.480
in the same space,
being here for one woman,

02:22.480 --> 02:26.200
and it doesn't matter
what gender you are.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.480
I think it's great - I don't...
I actually don't understand

02:28.480 --> 02:31.280
why it hasn't happened earlier,
to be honest.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.520
(CHEERING)

02:34.520 --> 02:37.480
Here comes Holly. She's holding the
card. I'm losing it. I'm so excited.

02:37.480 --> 02:40.120
I just want to know what's in there.
HOLLY: I've got a date card!

02:40.120 --> 02:42.360
(CHEERING)

02:42.360 --> 02:44.320
God! The anticipation.
HOLLY: Alright.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.080
I can confirm it's a group date.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.640
(CHEERING)

02:48.640 --> 02:50.240
First person up...

02:51.240 --> 02:52.880
..is Jamie-Lee.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.240
(CHEERING)
WOMAN: Yay!

02:55.240 --> 02:57.200
I'm the first name on the list. Hm!

02:57.200 --> 02:58.960
Matt.
(CHEERING)

02:58.960 --> 03:02.000
I don't know if the name order
means anything.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.040
HOLLY: Beau.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.040
But I'm gonna believe that it does.

03:05.040 --> 03:09.720
Especially because
I kissed Brooke on the first night.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.160
(LAUGHS)

03:11.160 --> 03:13.080
Bec.
Yes!
CONTESTANTS: Yay!

03:13.080 --> 03:14.640
MAN: Yes!

03:14.640 --> 03:16.320
HOLLY: Ryan.

03:16.320 --> 03:21.200
Holly's just calling out all
these names, one after the other.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.200
HOLLY: Carissa.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.760
Kurt. Holly.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.880
And my heart is racing.
I want this group date.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.040
How many names are left?

03:29.040 --> 03:30.440
Two.

03:30.440 --> 03:31.920
CONTESTANTS: Ooh!

03:34.120 --> 03:35.520
(EXHALES)

03:36.520 --> 03:37.760
Jess.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.720
(CHEERING AND LAUGHTER)

03:41.720 --> 03:43.200
And finally...

03:45.920 --> 03:47.640
..Konrad.

03:47.640 --> 03:51.160
(CHEERING)
Yeah, boy!

03:51.160 --> 03:55.680
I am so stoked that I got
the last spot on the group date.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.360
I just feel like...

03:57.360 --> 03:59.560
..I can...
I can be myself and...and...

03:59.560 --> 04:01.560
..truly show Brooke who I am.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.880
Who's excited?
Where are we?

04:11.880 --> 04:14.160
This is beautiful!

04:14.160 --> 04:15.720
Very London vibe.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.480
BEC: A bunch of us is heading
into the first group date.

04:18.480 --> 04:21.480
We arrive
at what can only be described

04:21.480 --> 04:24.280
as a quintessential
English cottage mansion.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.080
Maybe we're going to a high tea.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.280
BEC: It's very pretty,
it's very delightful,

04:28.280 --> 04:30.120
would be a great place for a date
if there weren't

04:30.120 --> 04:32.000
nine other people with me here.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.800
Oh, my God. Ah!

04:33.800 --> 04:36.720
Here they all come! It's great!
WOMEN: Hi!

04:36.720 --> 04:38.800
BROOKE: It's so good to see
all these gorgeous people

04:38.800 --> 04:42.200
out of their cocktail party outfits
for the first time.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.000
With both guys AND girls
on this date,

04:45.000 --> 04:48.360
I can already sense the intensity
is gonna be so different.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.720
Good morning, ladies.
Good morning, gentlemen!

04:52.720 --> 04:54.120
CONTESTANTS: Good morning!
Osher!

04:54.120 --> 04:55.840
Today's group date...

04:55.840 --> 04:57.520
..is a photo shoot.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.400
(CHEERING AND LAUGHTER)

04:59.400 --> 05:01.760
No way!

05:01.760 --> 05:04.160
I'm nervous. (LAUGHS)
I'm nervous for sure.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.960
Today, we're gonna be shooting
four separate photos,

05:06.960 --> 05:10.920
and each scene will depict a
different holiday throughout the year

05:10.920 --> 05:14.240
where romance can blossom.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.960
Oh, my gosh, a photo shoot.
I am not mad at this.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.040
This is going to be so fun!

05:19.040 --> 05:21.880
I can't wait to see
all the cute little outfits!

05:21.880 --> 05:23.800
To raise the stakes...
Oh, no.

05:23.800 --> 05:27.160
..these pictures will be published
right around the country

05:27.160 --> 05:29.640
in News Corp newspapers and websites,

05:29.640 --> 05:32.960
and this is The Daily Telegraph's
chief entertainment writer,

05:32.960 --> 05:34.040
Jonathon Moran.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.840
CONTESTANTS: Hi!

05:35.840 --> 05:40.280
Jonathon, what does it mean to you
to be able to publish these pictures?

05:40.280 --> 05:42.680
We're making history,
Bachelor history, certainly.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.160
We've got guys and girls
in this photo shoot,

05:45.160 --> 05:49.200
and I think this is absolutely
phenomenal and I am beyond excited.

05:49.200 --> 05:52.280
It's really exciting to be part
of a Bachelorette photo shoot.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.440
I think more so that it's
the first one where there's both

05:55.440 --> 05:57.880
men and women - like...

05:57.880 --> 05:59.800
..we're doing so much
for our community, and...

05:59.800 --> 06:04.080
..to have it published in...
like, across Australia...

06:05.320 --> 06:08.560
..just gonna do really...really
wonderful things for representation.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.760
OSHER: You know
what makes a picture pop, J.Mo,

06:11.760 --> 06:15.280
but how can we be sure that the
romance comes out in the picture?

06:15.280 --> 06:17.120
It's all about that energy
between you guys, and I think

06:17.120 --> 06:18.960
because we're doing
a whole bunch of different photos,

06:18.960 --> 06:21.080
you're gonna be thinking about
where you're standing,

06:21.080 --> 06:22.880
what you're wearing,
but don't think about that.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.560
Throw that out and think about

06:24.560 --> 06:26.200
the connection
with this beautiful person here.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.040
(LAUGHS)

06:28.040 --> 06:29.680
OSHER: Have a fantastic time!
Enjoy yourselves.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.480
CONTESTANTS: Thank you!
Take care, Brooke.

06:32.480 --> 06:35.600
So there's nine other people
on the group date today,

06:35.600 --> 06:37.360
which is a huge number.

06:37.360 --> 06:38.560
Hello!
Hey!

06:38.560 --> 06:42.880
For your scene today, it's gonna be
a New Year's Day pool party.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.920
Jamie-Lee, you're gonna be
the lifeguard today.

06:44.920 --> 06:45.920
Alright.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.480
And there's definitely
some big contenders in the mix.

06:49.480 --> 06:52.040
I need a spray tan
to keep up with you girls, but.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.720
KURT: So going into the photo shoot,
I'm just thinking,

06:54.720 --> 06:56.640
"I've got nothing to lose here."

06:58.840 --> 07:00.560
Here we go.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.920
Not bad.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.640
KURT:
Who cares if you embarrass yourself?

07:04.640 --> 07:07.360
Are you loving yourself now?
(LAUGHTER)

07:07.360 --> 07:11.200
The motto here
is just fake it till you make it.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.520
(LAUGHS)

07:14.800 --> 07:18.040
BROOKE:
I'm so pumped for this photo shoot.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.920
First off, we have
the New Year's Eve pool party,

07:20.920 --> 07:25.520
and it's my favourite holiday,
because it's also my birthday.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.280
Hello!
WOMAN: Hey!

07:27.280 --> 07:29.040
You guys look amazing.

07:29.040 --> 07:33.240
BROOKE: For this shoot, I've invited
Kurt, Carissa and Jamie-Lee.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.160
You look amazing.

07:35.160 --> 07:37.520
And everyone looks hot today.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.360
You look great, guys.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.640
BROOKE:
I'm trying not to make it so obvious

07:48.640 --> 07:51.120
by looking, like, constantly at them.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.440
(LAUGHS)

07:52.440 --> 07:54.240
You ready? Big smiles.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.240
It's getting really hot, so I need
someone to rub sunscreen on me.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.000
(CLEARS THROAT)
I'm here. I'm...convenient.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.160
It's part of my duty.
I'm ready to go.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.320
Oh, are you?
Oh, are we fighting over it?

08:03.640 --> 08:08.480
So Kurt definitely gets in there.
He is not shy.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.880
Alright!
Here we go. (LAUGHS)

08:10.880 --> 08:13.920
Every opportunity, Kurt's taking it.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.440
(WOMEN SQUEAL)
Ugh!

08:15.440 --> 08:17.440
(WOMEN LAUGH)

08:17.440 --> 08:19.600
He's, like...he's cutting my grass.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.360
MAN: That's it.
Hold it there for a sec.

08:24.360 --> 08:27.880
WOMAN: Wow!
CONTESTANTS: Ooh!

08:27.880 --> 08:30.040
Kurt's gotten in there. (LAUGHS)

08:30.040 --> 08:32.080
Alright, Kurt. Enough, please.

08:32.080 --> 08:35.160
This is, like...
this is my date too. (LAUGHS)

08:37.040 --> 08:38.760
These two could go over there
if they want to.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.440
I mean, I was...
the lifeguard, right?

08:41.440 --> 08:42.680
MAN: Banished.

08:44.240 --> 08:47.040
Jamie-Lee is definitely
pulling out all the stops.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.360
This reminds me
of when we did that magazine shoot.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.720
Do you remember?
Oh, yeah. That's a great day.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.200
That's nice, guys.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.040
Jamie-Lee's very close, right?
Yeah.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.680
She has the history.

08:57.680 --> 08:58.960
Yeah.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.720
BROOKE: It's really nice

09:00.720 --> 09:03.960
having these little moments
with Jamie-Lee, because...

09:03.960 --> 09:09.040
..there's a friendship there already
and there is a physical attraction.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.720
Like, it feels like it just
kind of needs to be, like, reignited.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.760
Hey!
Hello.

09:14.760 --> 09:16.680
Fancy seeing you here.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.960
I feel really confident
about the connection that we have.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.440
I'm not stupid. I know she's
going to be kissing other people.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.840
But I don't see anyone else
as a threat.

09:28.840 --> 09:30.200
It's game over.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.040
(LAUGHS)

09:35.240 --> 09:38.360
Trying to make an impression today.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.800
What are you?
Going to dinner.
Dinner.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.240
Taking a beautiful girl to dinner.
Not just dinner.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.520
Pretty lucky.

09:45.520 --> 09:49.520
KONRAD: In this photo shoot,
it's myself, Brooke and Jess

09:49.520 --> 09:51.200
in a Valentine's Day setting.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.520
I feel like there's
still tension between me and Jess.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.560
There's an elephant in the room.

09:56.560 --> 10:00.400
At the first cocktail party,
I asked everyone to let Brooke and I

10:00.400 --> 10:03.800
have the first opportunity
to use the love seat.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.040
So you made her a love seat?
It is, just over there. I did.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.480
Well, we did, made it together.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.800
KONRAD:
But Jess stole that moment from me.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.440
I thought this was Konrad's spot.
It is!

10:13.440 --> 10:15.520
It is?
And I've stolen it.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.560
Oh, my God, no!
(GASPS)
She did not.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.400
BROOKE: Oh, wow!

10:25.400 --> 10:27.840
(LAUGHS) Hello.

10:27.840 --> 10:28.920
Hello.
Hey.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.240
BROOKE: Oh, my God!

10:30.240 --> 10:33.000
Wow. (LAUGHS)
You look beautiful.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.360
Wow. You look amazing. (LAUGHS)
And you look gorgeous.

10:35.360 --> 10:36.920
Hello.
How you going?

10:36.920 --> 10:40.120
Good. How are you?
Good. Happy Valentine's Day.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.440
Are you sitting here?
I'm gonna sit here.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.680
Do you want me
to get the chair for you?

10:42.680 --> 10:44.200
Oh. Thank you.
Here you go. No worries.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.960
(LAUGHS) OK.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.360
KONRAD: For the photo shoot,
I'm playing Brooke's partner

10:50.360 --> 10:52.760
and we're on a dinner date,
so I am rapt.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.400
Alright? I'm...on cloud nine.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.880
OK, ready. OK. Cute.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.320
Now it's squished, yep.
Mm-hm.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.480
Yeah, it's good.
Alright. OK.

11:01.480 --> 11:02.920
Yep. Felt that.
Felt really good.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.360
And I also feel this cake.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.720
It'd be terrible
if you were allergic.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.960
Hey?
That'd be terrible if
you were allergic.

11:09.440 --> 11:13.840
JESS: I'm just feeling like perhaps
I'm gonna be left out a little bit.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.760
So I've got to figure out how
to slide my way in there. (LAUGHS)

11:18.760 --> 11:20.520
Do you really know?
Like, I can't really...

11:20.520 --> 11:23.480
Like, I can't be, like,
"Hi, guys. I'm here."

11:23.480 --> 11:26.360
You're good at jumping in.
(LAUGHS) That was arch.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.040
Oh, jeez.
(LAUGHS)

11:28.040 --> 11:29.480
Oh, yeah.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.640
The love seat.
Yeah.

11:31.640 --> 11:32.960
Ooh. Feisty.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.760
A little bit of tension.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.560
Like, can you...scooch over?

11:37.560 --> 11:39.800
You gonna push me out of the seat?
Yeah.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.880
Go for it.
Thanks.

11:42.760 --> 11:46.200
Why is Konrad standing?
(LAUGHTER)

11:46.200 --> 11:48.080
BEAU: He's been pushed out?

11:48.080 --> 11:49.600
Does it look like
he's been pushed out?

11:49.600 --> 11:51.400
You just fully got, um...

11:51.400 --> 11:53.600
I got my seat stolen.
..boycotted.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.880
I did.
This is for you.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.520
KONRAD: Jess is straight in there.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.640
She steals my seat.
And she's good at it.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.920
(LAUGHS) Mmm.
(LAUGHTER)

12:04.920 --> 12:06.800
BEAU: Is this is a repeat?
BEC: Yeah. Maybe.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.800
RYAN:
Taking the love seat once again.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.480
KONRAD:
Jess was definitely being strategic

12:10.480 --> 12:13.560
with how she's blocking me out,

12:13.560 --> 12:17.080
getting as much attention as she can
from Brooke.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.400
BEAU: Ooh, she's going for the lap.

12:20.080 --> 12:22.000
MAN: Yep, perfect.
(LAUGHS)

12:22.000 --> 12:23.880
I love it.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.280
Jess has definitely stolen
everything from Konrad...

12:28.280 --> 12:31.000
She's stolen
the whole moment right now.
Definitely stolen his thunder.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.360
BEC: Jess and Brooke do look
very into each other, though.

12:33.360 --> 12:34.400
BEAU: Yeah, they do.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.600
RYAN: Brooke and Jess
seemed very intimate.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.160
They...they had a little bit
of a moment. Eyes were locked.

12:39.160 --> 12:41.120
And Konrad looked very jealous.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.280
How you guys going there?

12:44.360 --> 12:46.080
KONRAD:
I kind of freak out a little bit,

12:46.080 --> 12:49.480
I'm not sure what to do,
and then I think,

12:49.480 --> 12:51.040
"Stuff it. Go big."

12:51.040 --> 12:53.440
You know,
"You've got nothing to lose."

12:53.440 --> 12:55.120
W...well, maybe, uh...

12:55.120 --> 12:58.040
..maybe we've been dating for
a while and it's Valentine's Day.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.480
Yeah?

12:59.480 --> 13:00.760
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

13:00.760 --> 13:02.040
Maybe it's, uh...

13:02.040 --> 13:04.480
..a moment for a, uh...

13:04.480 --> 13:06.280
Oh, don't...don't...

13:06.280 --> 13:08.600
(LAUGHS) A proposal?

13:08.600 --> 13:09.800
Yeah, why not?

13:09.800 --> 13:10.880
(LAUGHS)
This is a special ring.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.000
I've got little goosebumps here.
(LAUGHS)

13:13.000 --> 13:14.560
Ooh! Goosebumps!

13:14.560 --> 13:17.640
I guess...
Sorry, Jess.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.880
You've got to get out of here!
Sorry, yeah.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.360
If you could just get us
some more champagne.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.880
(ALL LAUGH)

13:22.880 --> 13:24.600
OK.

13:24.600 --> 13:25.960
Oh, my God!

13:25.960 --> 13:30.520
KONRAD: I'm coming in hard. I'm on
one knee. I've got the ring there.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.760
But Brooke's reaction
is just, like...

13:32.760 --> 13:34.760
..it's a moment
I'll never want to forget.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.320
This is a special ring too.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.200
I got it off my parents
a couple of years ago.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.400
Stop!
It's got their names engraved in it.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.840
So how many kids are we gonna have?
(LAUGHS)

13:43.840 --> 13:47.000
I probably want two munchkins -
one boy, one girl.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.440
The boy's older, so he
can look after the younger sister.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.440
Oh, yeah,
have you thought about this?
A lot.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.360
(LAUGHS) I've thought about this too.
(LAUGHS)

13:54.360 --> 13:57.760
You're actually getting me emotional.
Like, this is...this is too much.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.920
KONRAD: Really?

13:59.920 --> 14:02.920
She loved the moment,
so I feel like I kind of nailed it.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.640
(LAUGHS)

14:04.640 --> 14:07.600
OSHER: Next...
Oh, my God!

14:07.600 --> 14:09.000
There's actual fireworks!

14:09.000 --> 14:12.600
Sparks fly between Brooke and Holly.

14:12.600 --> 14:16.440
I really wanted to kiss her
in that moment.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.240
And later...

14:21.240 --> 14:23.480
..a thrilling first date.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.840
Whoa! (LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)

14:25.840 --> 14:27.520
DARVID: My heart's beating
'cause of the chopper.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.360
My heart's beating mostly
because I'm sitting next to Brooke.

14:30.360 --> 14:31.600
It's just all excitement.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.800
But will Darvid's bold move backfire?

14:36.800 --> 14:38.920
He's going.
He's going for it, is he?

14:38.920 --> 14:41.080
My initial reaction is...

14:41.080 --> 14:42.440
.."Dick."

14:42.440 --> 14:45.600
I thought you had potential
to be really a good friend, and...

14:45.600 --> 14:47.360
..you know what,
great that you did that.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.440
I can weed out the bad ones
from the good.

15:00.560 --> 15:04.160
For me,
it's about developing a connection

15:04.160 --> 15:06.080
and having a bit of fun.

15:06.080 --> 15:08.640
Angel energy.
That's what I'm channelling.
MAN: Angel energy.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.320
BROOKE: Halloween always brings out
people's wild sides,

15:11.320 --> 15:13.960
and I would love to see some of that.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.720
HMAS Love Boat, everyone.
Hey! (LAUGHS)

15:18.720 --> 15:20.360
How you doing?
Doing good. How are you?

15:20.360 --> 15:22.800
BROOKE:
For this shoot, I've invited Ryan...

15:22.800 --> 15:24.000
Oh!
Hello!

15:24.000 --> 15:25.480
..Rebecca...

15:25.480 --> 15:26.920
(LAUGHS) Hello!

15:26.920 --> 15:28.240
..Beau...
My little angel!

15:28.240 --> 15:29.240
(LAUGHS)

15:29.240 --> 15:30.240
..and Matt...

15:30.240 --> 15:32.240
Hello.
Hello!

15:32.240 --> 15:34.360
So I'm a very large pumpkin.

15:34.360 --> 15:38.160
..who seems to be having a little
trouble with his pumpkin suit.

15:38.160 --> 15:41.400
Feeling a little deflated,
but that's alright.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.760
You ready to get started?
(BROOKE LAUGHS)

15:44.760 --> 15:46.480
BROOKE: At the red carpet last night,

15:46.480 --> 15:49.080
Beau was doing
a whole lot of posing and pouting,

15:49.080 --> 15:52.840
and I'm kind of just worried
that he's gonna do the same today.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.320
You're really loving...

15:56.320 --> 16:02.280
BEAU: I feel like I do have
a bit of an advantage here.

16:02.280 --> 16:05.640
I'm looking pretty, pretty good,
to be honest.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.920
(LAUGHS) Did you just pout?

16:08.920 --> 16:10.520
You just pouted.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.800
Do devils pout?

16:12.800 --> 16:14.400
BEAU: The abs are popping.
The arms are popping.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.560
Everything's looking good.
So, let's get it on.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.320
I don't think I've ever had a guy
pout at me before. (LAUGHS)

16:20.320 --> 16:22.800
I don't know how I feel.
(BOTH LAUGH)

16:23.800 --> 16:26.160
I like to get involved
and get in front of that camera,

16:26.160 --> 16:27.960
as much as I can.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.680
I'm going to seize the moment.

16:29.680 --> 16:32.280
MAN: Oh. Oh, OK. I like it.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.720
RYAN: These photos are gonna be
in newspapers all over Australia,

16:34.720 --> 16:36.720
and...it feels cool.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.720
So many people are gonna see me.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.720
Do you want to
sail the seven seas together?

16:43.240 --> 16:49.000
It kind of felt like...the boys are
more into getting the actual shot.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.320
Go away. Go away. Go away.

16:52.480 --> 16:56.920
And it kind of feels like
I don't exist. (LAUGHS)

16:56.920 --> 16:59.800
I'm not impressed.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.400
(OWL HOOTS)

17:08.800 --> 17:10.800
(SIGHS)

17:10.800 --> 17:14.120
BROOKE: For the last photo shoot,
I've invited Holly to join me

17:14.120 --> 17:15.680
at the New Year's Eve ball.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.880
(HUMS)

17:16.880 --> 17:19.120
I've got clammy hands already.

17:19.120 --> 17:22.000
We shared a beautiful slow dance
on the red carpet last night,

17:22.000 --> 17:25.320
and I'm really looking forward
to this.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.000
(LAUGHS)

17:32.360 --> 17:35.640
Hey, girl. Hey!
Oh, my God. You look so stunning.

17:35.640 --> 17:36.840
(LAUGHS)

17:36.840 --> 17:39.920
HOLLY:
I walk into my photo shoot and...

17:39.920 --> 17:41.640
..it's magical.

17:41.640 --> 17:42.640
How are you?

17:42.640 --> 17:45.480
Oh. I'm better
now that I'm not so alone.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.000
(LAUGHS)
That's so nice.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.040
HOLLY: It's a New Year's Eve scene
with Brooke.

17:50.040 --> 17:54.880
And I'm stoked that it's
just gonna be her and I tonight.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.240
(CAMERA CLICKS)
That's it, guys.

17:57.240 --> 18:00.040
You just...have a moment together.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.760
(CAMERA CLICKS)
How you going?

18:01.760 --> 18:03.560
Good.
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

18:03.560 --> 18:06.000
Yeah. You've been patient.
You've been waiting all day for this.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.480
I know!

18:07.480 --> 18:08.720
(BOTH LAUGH)

18:08.720 --> 18:12.120
HOLLY: Brooke makes me feel
comfortable, safe.

18:12.120 --> 18:15.360
We've had a little laugh
every time we've been together,
which is really good.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.640
And just, like,
a friendship is forming,

18:17.640 --> 18:20.560
and that's how
all relationships start.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.240
We can, like,
slow-dance and just twirl.

18:22.240 --> 18:25.920
Mmm. I feel like, yeah, maybe...
That's alright?

18:25.920 --> 18:28.760
That feels natural for you?
Does that feel natural for YOU?

18:28.760 --> 18:31.080
I mean, you feel really nice.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.840
(BOTH LAUGH)

18:32.840 --> 18:34.560
Hold me.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.120
(LAUGHS)

18:36.120 --> 18:37.560
Are you comfortable?

18:37.560 --> 18:39.880
Yeah. (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

18:39.880 --> 18:45.000
BROOKE: This photo shoot scene
is truly magical.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.400
She's drawn me in - she's got this...

18:47.400 --> 18:50.680
..like, there's
obviously an attraction there.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.840
Yeah, she's beautiful.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.880
Getting close to 12 o'clock. (LAUGHS)

18:56.880 --> 18:59.880
Are you wanting a kiss?
(LAUGHS)

18:59.880 --> 19:02.400
Whoo. Like, I... Oh. Whoa.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.960
Yeah.

19:03.960 --> 19:08.200
I would love to
more than anything right now.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.440
Oh, my God!

19:19.440 --> 19:21.480
There's actual fireworks!

19:21.480 --> 19:23.560
(LAUGHS)

19:23.560 --> 19:25.280
Oh.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.320
BROOKE:
Holly makes me a little bit giddy.

19:28.320 --> 19:32.320
(LAUGHS) I really wanted to kiss her
in that moment,

19:32.320 --> 19:35.360
but, look, you know, I'm always
scared to make the first move.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.840
Thanks, Holly.
Thank you.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.560
Thanks for my nose kiss.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.920
I know.
What is it? A butterfly kiss?

19:44.920 --> 19:46.760
No.
Eskimo kiss?
Eskimos are like...

19:46.760 --> 19:48.640
(LAUGHS)
Eskimos are like that.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.680
With our lashes? (LAUGHS)

19:52.760 --> 19:56.040
HOLLY: This is, like, fairytale
stuff that just doesn't happen.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.520
I'm hoping that that same energy
can just continue

19:59.520 --> 20:01.320
into our next catch-up,

20:01.320 --> 20:04.840
and I can't wait
to finally get to kiss her.

20:20.240 --> 20:24.400
but one person that
really stood out to me was Darvid.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.200
My name's Darvid...
Darvid.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.560
..which is Persian.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.040
So I thought...
Are you a Persian prince?

20:29.040 --> 20:32.160
Could be. If you want me to be.
(LAUGHS)

20:32.160 --> 20:34.080
I might have embarrassed him
by saying "Persian prince",

20:34.080 --> 20:36.080
but I really love it. (LAUGHS)

20:36.080 --> 20:41.400
Darvid is very charming, and he's
got this quiet confidence about him,

20:41.400 --> 20:46.560
and that's why I gave him the first
impression rose and the first date.

20:46.560 --> 20:49.360
But let's face it - he is very hot,

20:49.360 --> 20:52.200
and I actually can't wait
to spend the day with him.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.360
MAN: Oh!
WOMAN: Look who it is!

20:56.360 --> 21:00.240
Hi!
Here she is!
Hey!

21:00.240 --> 21:03.280
TAJE: Brooke walks in
and she looks absolutely stunning.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.440
She looked really, really hot.

21:05.440 --> 21:07.640
It was awesome. (LAUGHS)

21:07.640 --> 21:09.800
I'm excited for today.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.840
Someone's coming on a date with me.

21:11.840 --> 21:14.320
(CHEERING)
Yes.

21:14.320 --> 21:18.120
But I thought
everyone should come see us off.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.960
Yeah?
MAN: Let's do it.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.680
I've planned
a pretty epic day for us,

21:22.680 --> 21:26.000
and I have a few surprises
up my sleeve.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.840
WOMAN: Oh, my gosh!
WOMAN 2: Oh, it's a heli...

21:27.840 --> 21:30.400
(HELICOPTER WHIRRS)
(CONTESTANTS SHOUT)

21:30.400 --> 21:32.880
Oh, my God!
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

21:36.360 --> 21:39.240
DARVID: A big chopper's coming in,
flying in to the mansion.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.200
I'm so over the moon, stoked.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.720
I'm ready to get in that chopper
and fly away with Brooke.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.160
(LAUGHS)

21:45.160 --> 21:46.480
Alright, guys. See you later!

21:46.480 --> 21:48.520
Bye!

21:48.520 --> 21:50.520
I'm so keen.

21:50.520 --> 21:53.240
I'm, like, super-jealous.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.000
And I feel like the first date,
Darvid's kind of got

21:55.000 --> 21:56.840
a little advantage.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.000
It sucks. (LAUGHS)

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
(BROOKE LAUGHS)

22:01.000 --> 22:03.600
(CHEERING)

22:03.600 --> 22:06.040
Bye, guys! Oh, my God!

22:06.040 --> 22:07.360
It's so good!

22:07.360 --> 22:09.720
DARVID: I've been in a chopper
once before, but...

22:09.720 --> 22:11.440
..nothing like this.

22:11.440 --> 22:14.840
I'm looking at Brooke next to me.
She's looking gorgeous.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.520
I'm feeling like
the luckiest man in the world.

22:16.520 --> 22:18.240
Don't know what I was
expecting, but it wasn't this.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.640
Wasn't this?
Nup.

22:19.640 --> 22:21.880
Way better.
This is good.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.560
DARVID: My heart's beating
'cause of the chopper.

22:23.560 --> 22:25.960
My heart's beating mostly
because I'm sitting next to Brooke.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.640
It's just all excitement.

22:27.640 --> 22:30.040
Whoa! (LAUGHS)
Whoa! (LAUGHS)

22:30.040 --> 22:31.560
Whoo-hoo!

22:31.560 --> 22:33.280
Oh, my God.
Oh, mate.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.120
(BOTH LAUGH)

22:35.120 --> 22:36.600
My belly just went all the way up...
Up there.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.520
..into my...my head.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.920
(LAUGHS)

22:40.920 --> 22:44.280
BROOKE: It's our first date.
It's...it's OK to be nervous.

22:44.280 --> 22:47.040
But instantly, we are just...

22:47.040 --> 22:48.920
..like, drawn to one another.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.440
I'm so glad
that you came on this date.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.200
Thanks for inviting me.
That's alright.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.000
(LAUGHS)
Nice.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.080
It's a, like,
really weird but really nice feeling.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.640
What are you doing to me?

23:01.640 --> 23:04.360
It's a surprise. I love surprises.

23:04.360 --> 23:05.840
DARVID:
I don't know what the surprise is,

23:05.840 --> 23:08.240
but Brooke looks like
she's ready for it.

23:08.240 --> 23:09.480
She's smiling.

23:09.480 --> 23:13.160
So I'm just going for it. I know
that whatever it is, I'll love it.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.320
There we go.
MAN: Enjoy your date, guys.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.720
Thank you.
Thank you.

23:17.720 --> 23:20.000
So we're at the foothills
of the Blue Mountains.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.040
Yes.

23:21.040 --> 23:25.040
I actually love getting outdoors.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.360
Did you wear your walking shoes?
Yeah, yep.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.080
Come down this way.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.640
Holy shit.

23:32.640 --> 23:33.960
I know.
Far out.

23:33.960 --> 23:37.680
This is awesome.
(LAUGHS)

23:37.680 --> 23:42.080
So...I thought we could do

23:42.080 --> 23:44.720
something a little bit
out of the comfort zone.

23:44.720 --> 23:45.880
OK.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.840
(LAUGHS)
Oh, my God!

23:50.320 --> 23:54.800
So, we're going to have
a little set-up off the ledge.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.280
And sit?
And just sit.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.240
Off the ledge.
That is awesome.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.680
DARVID: I've never done
anything this extreme

24:00.680 --> 24:02.960
on a first date, that's for sure.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.920
Holy shit!

24:06.360 --> 24:07.640
Looking good.
Sexy?

24:07.640 --> 24:09.560
Sexy.
(LAUGHS)
Stunning.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.240
Your heart pumping?

24:11.240 --> 24:13.200
Yeah - I'm actually getting, like...
Little bit nervy?

24:13.200 --> 24:14.720
..now nervous, yeah.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.480
I'm getting, like,
a little bit nervous.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.200
Like, I'm getting, like,
clammy hands.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.720
But you know what?

24:21.720 --> 24:23.160
Whoo!

24:23.160 --> 24:24.480
Let's do it.

24:24.480 --> 24:27.400
(LAUGHS)
Whoo! Ah!

24:27.400 --> 24:29.680
Look down. Or don't.
Whoo! Holy shit!

24:29.680 --> 24:32.600
(LAUGHS)
Oh, my God. Ah!

24:32.600 --> 24:35.120
She's trying to kill me
on the first date. Here we go.

24:35.120 --> 24:38.240
Your heart pumping?
Yeah. It's pumping.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.280
Wait.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.320
(BOTH LAUGH)

24:42.320 --> 24:43.960
Whoa!
OK.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.800
(LAUGHS)
I'm gonna sit. You ready?

24:45.800 --> 24:47.920
OK. This is...
Oh!

24:47.920 --> 24:50.960
(LAUGHS) Come down.

24:50.960 --> 24:53.960
Like, and we're just gonna be
hanging there?

24:53.960 --> 24:57.560
My God. We're pretty bloody high.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.440
DARVID: So we're hanging
off the edge of a cliff.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.000
My heart's racing.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.600
I...I think I'm...
I'm calming Brooke's nerves

25:04.600 --> 25:06.360
as much as she's calming mine.

25:06.360 --> 25:09.240
So why did you, like,
put yourself out there again?

25:09.240 --> 25:12.680
Is it something you were thinking
about doing or you just, like...

25:12.680 --> 25:15.000
I'm big on timing.
Mmm.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.760
Timing's been, like,
really awkward in the past,

25:17.760 --> 25:21.200
but more recently,
I feel like it's aligned.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.480
Mmm.
It is scary.

25:22.480 --> 25:27.680
I'm...you know, I'm dating so many
people, again, being vulnerable,

25:27.680 --> 25:30.440
but I have no...I have no shame
with being vulnerable.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.720
I think...

25:31.720 --> 25:33.960
..being...being vulnerable
for me is, like...

25:33.960 --> 25:35.840
It's quite s...
..letting people in.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.160
It's sexy in a way.
Like, you're just...

25:37.160 --> 25:38.160
(LAUGHS)
No, it is.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.520
Thank you.
Like, you're just confident.

25:39.520 --> 25:41.200
You're, like, "This is who I am."

25:41.200 --> 25:43.360
So, what are YOU looking for?

25:43.360 --> 25:47.360
I just want someone
to share my life with, to be honest.

25:47.360 --> 25:50.200
It would be nice to
have someone there to grow with...

25:50.200 --> 25:51.200
Mm-hm.

25:51.200 --> 25:54.960
..and to explore with
and to laugh with and...

25:54.960 --> 25:55.960
Yeah.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.920
Like, I mean, we're already
doing that, on the first date.

25:57.920 --> 25:59.520
I feel like
we haven't stopped laughing.

25:59.520 --> 26:00.520
No, which is...

26:00.520 --> 26:03.160
And if it's not at each other,
it's, like...yeah.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.440
(LAUGHS)
Yeah.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.800
That's...that's...
that's what I mean.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.480
Like, that's why I feel
so comfortable around you,

26:07.480 --> 26:09.240
'cause you're just...
you've got a beautiful smile

26:09.240 --> 26:11.920
and, like, your eyes go...
pierce straight through my head

26:11.920 --> 26:12.920
in a good way.

26:12.920 --> 26:15.520
(LAUGHS)
And...
I aim for a good way.

26:15.520 --> 26:19.000
Oh, you're so cute, Darvid.
You make me feel equally the same.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.320
It's really nice.
Good.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.680
Yeah.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.240
BROOKE: Darvid just has
this really beautiful energy

26:24.240 --> 26:27.680
where I feel
really comfortable and safe.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.400
It's a really nice feeling,

26:33.400 --> 26:35.080
I was gonna say, like,
it actually feels like

26:35.080 --> 26:36.760
I've known you for a lot longer.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.120
That...I feel like
I can't put my finger on it,

26:39.120 --> 26:41.680
but it feels like the exact same way.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.200
He makes me feel really appreciated.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.120
I don't even know this guy.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.360
(LAUGHS)

27:02.680 --> 27:04.840
BROOKE: Wow.
It's really pouring down, isn't it?

27:04.840 --> 27:05.880
DARVID: It is.

27:05.880 --> 27:08.160
This is a really Notebook...
this is a Notebook moment.

27:09.960 --> 27:10.960
Yep.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.680
I don't mind.
I actually don't mind it.

27:12.680 --> 27:15.480
I mean, there's no-one else
I'd rather be stuck up here with.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.720
DARVID: This is one of the best days
of my life.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.800
I'm staring at, like,
the most beautiful girl.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.400
She's got such a stunning
set of eyes on her, honestly.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.280
Just...like, I lose my words

27:25.280 --> 27:27.360
every time I look at her.

27:27.360 --> 27:30.280
But she warms my heart.
She looks beautiful in every light.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.320
It started raining.
She still looked stunning.

27:33.320 --> 27:36.760
And, yeah, she just warms me up,
makes me feel really merry.

27:36.760 --> 27:40.880
So, I do have
a bit of a surprise for you.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.640
It's a little something
to, like, warm us up.

27:43.640 --> 27:45.640
Ooh!
So...

27:45.640 --> 27:47.680
Oh!

27:47.680 --> 27:49.160
Madam, sir.
(BROKE AND DARVID LAUGH)

27:49.160 --> 27:52.640
A special delivery. Here we come.
BROOKE: Yay!

27:54.400 --> 27:56.320
DARVID: Just as I thought
things couldn't get any better,

27:56.320 --> 27:58.440
in comes a dude in a tux...

27:58.440 --> 28:00.120
Here we are -
so we've got some special treats

28:00.120 --> 28:01.720
for your little...tete-a-tete.

28:01.720 --> 28:03.480
If you can pass that through.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.760
This way. There we go.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.800
DARVID: I feel like this day is...
is surreal.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.440
Best day ever. (LAUGHS)

28:11.440 --> 28:13.760
So...
What have you got for me?

28:13.760 --> 28:15.520
I've got us hot chocolates.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.400
(LAUGHS)

28:17.400 --> 28:20.320
I'm lost for words, honestly.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.320
OK.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.800
Cheers.
Cheers.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.040
This is the perfect way to...

28:25.040 --> 28:27.680
..end...a little bit of rain.

28:27.680 --> 28:28.680
Mmm.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.760
A little bit of sweetness.

28:31.760 --> 28:33.200
Oh!

28:34.200 --> 28:35.880
You've thought of everything.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.520
I tried to.
Just a little superstar.

28:38.520 --> 28:42.320
BROOKE: Darvid makes me feel
so calm, relaxed.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.120
It's very unusual.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.880
It's never like
what I felt initially with someone.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.400
I just want to spend time with him
and get to know him.

28:49.400 --> 28:53.440
I feel like that's...
something special.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.000
How do you find dating?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
(LAUGHS)
Sorry.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.160
That's a really weird question,
isn't it?
No, that's alright.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.480
Like, how do you find it?

28:59.480 --> 29:00.840
Is it...
I kinda...

29:00.840 --> 29:02.640
..hard for you - it's, like...?

29:02.640 --> 29:04.720
I think it's gotten harder...

29:04.720 --> 29:06.680
Mmm.
..is the way I'd put it.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.520
Just because
when I first started dating,

29:08.520 --> 29:10.760
I kind of didn't know what I wanted.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.120
Yep.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.680
So I was kind of happy with...

29:13.680 --> 29:16.160
..not whatever, but...you know.

29:17.280 --> 29:20.680
Everything sort of seemed
so fresh and new.

29:20.680 --> 29:23.880
And now it's, like, I kind of know
what I want and who I am.

29:23.880 --> 29:24.880
Mmm.

29:24.880 --> 29:28.400
But, yeah, I don't really have,
like, a instant connection.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.640
I haven't had one...

29:30.640 --> 29:31.960
..seriously, for a long time.

29:31.960 --> 29:34.040
Mm-hm.
Like...

29:34.040 --> 29:38.040
So it's kind of scary but exciting
that I feel that with you,

29:38.040 --> 29:39.360
straight off the bat.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.560
I felt that at the red carpet,
but I just...

29:41.560 --> 29:42.960
..I don't know.

29:42.960 --> 29:45.920
I'm just a bit proud to, like, say
it, but I'm happy to say it now.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.240
Really?
Yeah.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.240
Oh.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.080
I think...
Wow.

29:50.080 --> 29:53.360
Oh, give me your hand.
That's so cold.

29:53.360 --> 29:56.040
I feel like the connection
with Darvid is really strong already,

29:56.040 --> 29:57.720
you know, like...

29:57.720 --> 30:00.720
I'm not scared. It feels great.
It feels beautiful.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.280
Well...

30:03.680 --> 30:07.680
..I do want to continue this,
absolutely.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.080
Mm-hm.
I still want you here.

30:10.080 --> 30:13.520
Let me take that, because...
(CLEARS THROAT)

30:13.520 --> 30:15.280
..um...

30:15.280 --> 30:17.960
I'm not very glamorous.
I'm still.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.760
I don't really try to be.
You shouldn't - you are...

30:20.760 --> 30:22.320
But...
..you're glamorous
in your own right.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.800
I know.
(LAUGHS)

30:23.800 --> 30:25.480
(LAUGHS)
Oh! (LAUGHS)

30:27.080 --> 30:29.200
Darvid.
Mmm.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.480
Will you accept this rose?

30:31.480 --> 30:33.480
I will. Absolutely.
Good.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.920
Thank you. I don't know
which way to go. (LAUGHS)

30:47.720 --> 30:50.360
BROOKE:
I really enjoyed kissing Darvid.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.680
I think kissing him was just, like...

30:53.680 --> 30:56.560
..the end of a really special day,

30:56.560 --> 30:58.600
and I think...
it makes me even more happier

30:58.600 --> 31:01.600
that we're on, like,
this really good trajectory of...

31:01.600 --> 31:03.520
..what could be
something really special.

31:06.320 --> 31:07.800
Mmm.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.480
Like, I'm actually so smitten.

31:16.080 --> 31:17.720
Thank you so much
for coming on this date with me.

31:17.720 --> 31:19.240
Thank you for taking me.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.400
DARVID: I'm feeling so many emotions
right now.

31:22.400 --> 31:25.400
I'm excited. I'm shaking.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.440
I'm like a big kid. I'm just giddy.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.080
I'm stoked.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.560
I'm excited for what...
what's to come.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.680
And me. Mmm.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.200
DARVID:
I could definitely see myself

31:38.200 --> 31:39.720
falling in love with Brooke
for sure,

31:39.720 --> 31:41.280
no doubt about it.

31:41.280 --> 31:43.160
I'm already on the way.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.040
OSHER: Next...

31:47.040 --> 31:48.320
You make me feel something. (LAUGHS)

31:48.320 --> 31:51.080
What do I make you feel?
(LAUGHS)

31:51.080 --> 31:53.160
..as passion fires up...

31:53.160 --> 31:55.120
JAMIE-LEE: This is
what a couple should look like.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.240
I should feel jealous, but I don't.
I'm...I'm in awe.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.080
..Darvid feels the heat.

32:00.080 --> 32:02.160
Actions speak louder than words.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.080
What you've done
is a reflection of you, not me.

32:05.080 --> 32:08.200
At the end of the day,
I'm happy that I did what I did.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.480
OSHER: Want the inside scoop?

32:20.480 --> 32:22.320
only on 10 play.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.400
JAMIE-LEE: How are we feeling?

32:27.400 --> 32:29.400
BEAU: Good.
RYAN: Uh, good. Yeah.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.440
Yeah? After your photo shoot?
Yeah.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.080
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah...

32:33.080 --> 32:35.520
The more you get in something like
this, always the confidence just...

32:35.520 --> 32:37.880
100%.
..comes out, doesn't it?

32:37.880 --> 32:40.560
EMILY: So, do you have a plan?
MATT: Look.

32:40.560 --> 32:43.360
I...I just want to get a bit of time
to chat with Brooke tonight.

32:43.360 --> 32:46.440
Do you think, like,
that the girls and boys, um,

32:46.440 --> 32:48.520
who didn't get
to go to the group date

32:48.520 --> 32:50.720
could maybe go first?

32:50.720 --> 32:52.560
Yeah. I'm...I'm fine with that. Yep.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.080
No, good. OK.
I hope that that runs to plan.

32:56.080 --> 32:59.720
EMILY: Me, Steven, Taje and Ritu,

32:59.720 --> 33:04.400
we think that it's only fair
that we speak to Brooke first

33:04.400 --> 33:06.440
at the cocktail party.

33:06.440 --> 33:07.960
We've had the least amount of time.

33:07.960 --> 33:12.040
So, yeah, I'm really excited.
(LAUGHS)

33:12.040 --> 33:13.200
(WOMAN LAUGHS)
Hi!

33:13.200 --> 33:15.360
Hello!
Oh, my gosh!

33:15.360 --> 33:17.320
Stunner!
Oh, look, she's here.

33:17.320 --> 33:20.560
Stop it. What does she look like?
WOMAN: Oh, she looks gorgeous.

33:20.560 --> 33:21.600
Hello, Matt.
How you doing?

33:21.600 --> 33:22.800
Good to see ya.
Wow! Good.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.760
How are you going?
Amazing again, by the way.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.760
Thank you! Hello, beautiful.
Hello!

33:26.760 --> 33:29.760
Hello.
I know! It has been long.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.120
I was gonna grab you...

33:31.120 --> 33:32.440
Yeah?
..for a quick chat.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.720
See you, guys. I'll see you soon.
(LAUGHS)

33:34.720 --> 33:36.960
How are YOU going?
MATT: Good, good.

33:36.960 --> 33:39.600
My little pumpkin. (LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS) Look.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.520
Don't mind letting Matt sort of...
Yeah, no.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.520
I'm actually, like...
..go - that's fine.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.000
..I'm, you know, pleased for him.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.160
WOMAN: Yep.
Yeah, no.

33:46.160 --> 33:48.200
But, you know, after... (LAUGHS)

33:48.200 --> 33:49.760
But, yeah, yeah, that's enough.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.640
DARVID: So how are you all feeling,
heading into the cocktail party?

33:53.640 --> 33:56.000
I'm...look,
I'm not as confident as you,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.320
given that you're, um,
already safe and have a rose.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.280
Yes.
(CLEARS THROAT)

34:00.280 --> 34:02.280
DARVID: I've been over the moon
since my single date.

34:02.280 --> 34:06.400
But I definitely want
to keep our romance fresh.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.760
It's such
a different scenario where...

34:08.760 --> 34:10.440
..obviously,
she's dating so many people,

34:10.440 --> 34:12.960
so I want to keep myself top of mind.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.400
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

34:14.400 --> 34:19.680
How much time do you think
is appropriate to then walk over?

34:23.520 --> 34:26.400
If he goes to get her now...
He's going. He's going for it.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.000
Is he?

34:29.160 --> 34:31.000
(BROOKE LAUGHS)
Hey.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.640
BROOKE: Hello.
DARVID: Sorry to interrupt.

34:32.640 --> 34:37.120
Oh. (LAUGHS) You're stealing me?
That's alright. That's alright.

34:37.120 --> 34:40.200
EMILY: Darvid's gone up
and he's pulled her.

34:40.200 --> 34:41.800
BEAU: Oh, wow. He just broke it up.

34:41.800 --> 34:45.640
My initial reaction is, "Dick."

34:45.640 --> 34:46.800
Oh, OK.
I'm jumpin' in.

34:46.800 --> 34:49.000
OK. OK, OK, OK.
I'll be quick. I'll be quick.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.640
You look great.
Thank you. So do you.

34:50.640 --> 34:52.920
Yeah.
I love the suit.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.600
That's real (BLEEP).

34:54.600 --> 34:56.880
(LAUGHS)
(OTHERS LAUGH)

34:56.880 --> 34:58.080
Well, it is.

34:58.080 --> 35:01.240
I'm really upset.
You have been guaranteed a rose.

35:01.240 --> 35:03.120
You know you're here tomorrow.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.960
So...why tonight?

35:05.960 --> 35:07.480
I won't take much of your time.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.120
But I just want to
have a little wrap-up with you

35:09.120 --> 35:10.680
before you got stuck in
with everyone else.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.320
Yeah. Don't worry.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.640
I feel like I really...had
a good chance to get to know you,

35:14.640 --> 35:18.280
which is nice, but I don't want it
to just drop off.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.320
So I kind of
just want to touch base.
You want to keep it spicy.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.800
Yeah. Keep it spicy.
(LAUGHS)

35:21.800 --> 35:23.520
Keep it interesting.
No, I love this.

35:23.520 --> 35:26.400
I love hearing this.
'Cause, yeah. No.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.880
Keep it.
So, yeah.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.600
Keep doing it. Cheers.
OK, good.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.240
I just...I hate that.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.840
Like, I find that so...

35:32.840 --> 35:34.320
..muggy.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.320
STEVE: Emily is livid at the moment,

35:38.320 --> 35:41.200
but we're...we're all, obviously,
trying to form connections

35:41.200 --> 35:43.480
and click with Brooke, so...

35:43.480 --> 35:46.360
..if Darvid wants
to kind of do that,

35:46.360 --> 35:47.800
you know,
he does have every right to.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.920
I feel like the ball's
in his court, though, to be honest.

35:49.920 --> 35:52.160
He can do whatever he wants
at this point in time.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.680
He's not here to impress us.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.720
WOMAN: Oh, there she is.
MAN: There she is, yeah.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.920
Here she comes.
..yesterday...

36:01.920 --> 36:04.960
BROOKE: Every time I come over here,
it's like a party. I love it.

36:04.960 --> 36:07.360
I love it. Holly.
Like in the cabana.

36:07.360 --> 36:08.960
Can I steal you, gorgeous?

36:08.960 --> 36:11.360
Holly. Enjoy.
Crack-a-lackin'!

36:11.360 --> 36:13.880
See ya. Hi.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.360
Hello.
How you doing?

36:15.360 --> 36:19.160
BROOKE: I've been dying to see Holly
since our photo shoot.

36:19.160 --> 36:23.440
At this point,
I feel like Holly and I,

36:23.440 --> 36:25.000
we're connecting,

36:25.000 --> 36:26.280
but I'm still...

36:26.280 --> 36:29.640
..I still want to get to know her
on a deeper level.

36:29.640 --> 36:32.400
You know what, I'm just gonna, like,
yeah, snuggle in, because...

36:32.400 --> 36:33.880
..trying to be,
like, you know, alpha dog...

36:33.880 --> 36:35.480
Yeah. You are.
..trying to impress you, like...

36:35.480 --> 36:38.680
You...you don't have to
worry about that.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.200
I really loved...
Yeah.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.720
..that New Year's Eve.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.440
Me too. It was...yeah.
It was really cute.

36:44.440 --> 36:47.320
As I mentioned, I really
would have liked to kiss you,

36:47.320 --> 36:49.000
but I just
didn't want you to think...

36:49.000 --> 36:50.920
No.
.."Oh, she's not interested."

36:50.920 --> 36:53.080
I wanted to save it for another time.
Was that a little blush?

36:53.080 --> 36:54.840
Yeah, maybe.
Ooh!
Maybe.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.560
You make me feel something. (LAUGHS)
What do I make you feel?

36:57.560 --> 36:59.080
(LAUGHS)

36:59.080 --> 37:01.280
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.880
So Brooke's in the...
Hide-and-seek.
The gazebo.

37:05.880 --> 37:09.240
There's...there's something there,
between the two of them, you know.

37:10.560 --> 37:16.880
Holly and Brooke, their connection
is visible from so far away.

37:16.880 --> 37:20.840
It's such an intimate moment.
They both look stunning.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.160
I'm, like, a bit lost for words.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.720
(BOTH LAUGH)
Stop.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.400
JAMIE-LEE: This is
what a couple should look like.

37:26.400 --> 37:29.560
I...I should feel jealous,
but I don't. I'm...I'm in awe.

37:29.560 --> 37:31.920
I feel like I haven't even scratched
the surface with Holly just yet.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.040
No, I feel like we've got,
like, a whole...

37:34.040 --> 37:35.400
I know. No, no.
..whole lot to talk about.

37:35.400 --> 37:39.240
And, like, I'm...so excited to...
to really get to know you.

37:39.240 --> 37:40.360
Oh.
So...

37:40.360 --> 37:42.000
(LAUGHS)

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Give me a moment.
Oh! You make me gush.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.200
(BOTH LAUGH)

37:45.200 --> 37:46.520
There's something I have...

37:46.520 --> 37:49.320
..I'm not very glamorous
with this, but...

37:49.320 --> 37:51.240
..'cause you are my glamazon.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.720
Yeah. I feel like a glamazon.
Yeah? You feel like a glamazon.

37:53.720 --> 37:56.840
You look, well, glamorous.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.640
So, Holly...

37:58.640 --> 38:01.400
..will you accept this rose?

38:01.400 --> 38:03.480
I will.
I'm so glad.

38:07.920 --> 38:11.400
HOLLY: I feel delighted
that Brooke's given me a rose.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.680
And I can't wait to get to know her
and see if we are,

38:16.680 --> 38:20.120
you know, compatible
and right for each other.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.120
Yeah, I'm thrilled.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.240
(CRICKETS CHIRP)

38:29.240 --> 38:31.160
BEAU: I was with Emily, and, um,

38:31.160 --> 38:33.720
it didn't...
it wasn't well received over there.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.800
No, I gauged that.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.080
I mean, it wasn't premeditated,

38:38.080 --> 38:40.560
I didn't kind of
want to ruffle feathers, but...

38:40.560 --> 38:42.240
..as I sort of...

38:42.240 --> 38:44.200
..was in motion,
I saw it all happening,

38:44.200 --> 38:47.480
so I was kinda trying to be quick
about what I was doing.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.600
DARVID: I can definitely see
that I've had a really lucky streak

38:53.600 --> 38:55.080
straight out the gate with Brooke,

38:55.080 --> 38:57.840
so I know that people are
feeling completely different to me.

38:58.840 --> 39:02.120
But I...at the end of the day,
I'm happy that I did what I did.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.400
Oh, no.
BEAU: Uh-oh.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.600
DARVID: Em, do you want to hit me
with some flak while I'm here?

39:05.600 --> 39:08.720
EMILY: I just think, like,
it is what it is.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.200
You've got your own brain,
your own two feet.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.800
You went and did what you did.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.360
And I'm just gonna keep you
at arm's distance.

39:13.360 --> 39:16.520
I'm no longer trusting you.
That is what it is.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.720
Fair enough.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.200
I think that you were
a really kind person,

39:19.200 --> 39:22.040
I thought you had potential
to be really a good friend, and...

39:22.040 --> 39:24.440
..you know what,
great that you did that.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.640
I can weed out the bad ones
from the good.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.520
It just hurt my feelings.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.080
You know, I'm not silly.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.680
I know that that was...you know,
someone was probably gonna do that,

39:34.680 --> 39:37.960
but...doesn't, like,
make it less painful or...

39:37.960 --> 39:40.680
..less...less upsetting.

39:40.680 --> 39:42.680
Yeah.
Actions speak louder than words.

39:42.680 --> 39:46.880
What you've done is a reflection
of you, not me, and that's it.

39:46.880 --> 39:50.000
DARVID: I definitely didn't plan
the heat that I'm copping.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.920
I didn't expect it from Emily.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.880
But I don't really want to hang back.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.320
I am just here
for my connection with Brooke.

39:57.320 --> 39:58.680
(INAUDIBLE)

40:00.440 --> 40:01.920
That's why we're here.

40:19.880 --> 40:22.080
EMILY:
I'm feeling a little bit on edge.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.560
I didn't go on the group date.

40:24.560 --> 40:28.800
And, thanks to Darvid, I've
not had time with Brooke tonight.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.960
I'm worried
I missed my opportunity to show her

40:31.960 --> 40:36.120
that I'm really interested in her
romantically.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.080
Good evening, ladies, gentlemen.

40:52.160 --> 40:53.320
Holly...

40:53.320 --> 40:55.520
..and Darvid,

40:55.520 --> 41:00.600
those roses clearly show that
the spark you feel with Brooke is...

41:00.600 --> 41:02.400
..really starting to catch fire.

41:02.400 --> 41:05.000
Congratulations.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.920
The two of you are safe tonight.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.600
But that does leave 13 of you
without a rose.

41:14.800 --> 41:20.960
And tonight,
Brooke has only 12 roses to give.

41:24.360 --> 41:26.400
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry.

41:27.760 --> 41:31.080
One of you
will be leaving the mansion tonight.

41:37.560 --> 41:39.480
Wish you all the very best.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.760
Here's Brooke.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.560
JAMIE-LEE:
I don't know if I've misread

41:47.560 --> 41:50.160
the connection
between Brooke and myself.

41:50.160 --> 41:54.440
I'm competing against
so many amazing people,

41:54.440 --> 42:00.080
and I've already noticed how strong
Holly's connection is with Brooke.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.920
I'm already invested.

42:05.040 --> 42:07.480
I'm just hoping
that she feels the same.

42:14.680 --> 42:16.680
Konrad.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.480
Konrad, will you accept this rose?

42:26.480 --> 42:28.200
I'd love to.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.680
Matt.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.400
Ritu.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.680
Thank you.
Thank you, Brooke.

43:13.480 --> 43:16.160
EMILY: I'm really getting
more and more worried.

43:24.880 --> 43:26.080
Kurt.

43:29.120 --> 43:32.840
EMILY: I've seen all these people
making these connections so early on.

43:34.080 --> 43:35.920
Taje.

43:38.040 --> 43:41.480
EMILY: And Darvid
has put a lot of doubt in my mind.

43:44.200 --> 43:45.760
Carissa.

43:53.760 --> 43:57.560
EMILY: I just feel invisible.

44:09.400 --> 44:11.520
Emily.

44:18.360 --> 44:20.280
Emily, will you accept this rose?

44:20.280 --> 44:22.720
(LAUGHS) Yes.
(LAUGHS)

44:30.000 --> 44:36.640
JAMIE-LEE: I honestly have no idea
where I stand with Brooke right now.

44:36.640 --> 44:39.440
On the group date,
we really weren't able to talk much,

44:39.440 --> 44:43.920
and Brooke had such a intimate
and beautiful moment with Holly.

44:43.920 --> 44:45.640
Steve.

44:47.160 --> 44:49.760
JAMIE-LEE: I felt really confident
a few days ago,

44:49.760 --> 44:53.560
and now I'm just...I'm unsure.

44:57.920 --> 44:59.280
Jamie-Lee.

45:02.320 --> 45:04.600
BEAU: And there's three roses left.

45:08.080 --> 45:10.120
I'm not ready to go home yet.

45:10.120 --> 45:13.880
I've shown her exactly who I am
and what I'm about.

45:18.040 --> 45:19.640
Jess.

45:42.880 --> 45:44.600
Bec.

46:18.040 --> 46:19.640
Ryan.

46:24.600 --> 46:27.360
Ryan, will you accept this rose?

46:27.360 --> 46:28.680
Yes, definitely.

46:28.680 --> 46:30.440
(LAUGHS)
Thank you so much.

46:48.160 --> 46:49.800
Beau.

46:49.800 --> 46:53.000
I'm sorry,
but you did not receive a rose.

46:54.760 --> 46:56.960
Just take the time now
to please say goodbye.

47:00.240 --> 47:01.920
Good luck.

47:01.920 --> 47:03.720
(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

47:11.120 --> 47:12.440
Thank you.

47:17.520 --> 47:21.480
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

47:22.480 --> 47:24.080
JAMIE-LEE:
By giving me a rose tonight,

47:24.080 --> 47:26.360
Brooke is telling me
that she wants to see

47:26.360 --> 47:28.400
if there's something between us.

47:29.760 --> 47:33.000
I need to step up a little bit.

47:33.000 --> 47:37.520
I'm going to make sure that Brooke
knows exactly how I feel about her.

47:40.040 --> 47:43.080
OSHER:
Next time on The Bachelorette...

47:45.040 --> 47:47.880
I'm excited to take you
on a really special date.

47:47.880 --> 47:49.480
Oh, my gosh!

47:49.480 --> 47:50.760
One, two, three.

47:50.760 --> 47:53.000
..Holly's fancy footwork...

47:53.000 --> 47:54.200
Much better!

47:54.200 --> 47:56.840
..sees her dance her way
into Brooke's heart.

47:56.840 --> 48:00.200
I really, really love
getting to know you, Holly.

48:00.200 --> 48:02.360
Yeah?
Yeah.
I love getting to know you.

48:02.360 --> 48:05.480
But when Darvid
faces the firing line...

48:05.480 --> 48:07.520
I'm gonna pick Darvid.
(CHEERING AND LAUGHTER)

48:07.520 --> 48:09.240
Feel a target on your back here,
Darvid?

48:09.240 --> 48:10.320
Big-time.

48:10.320 --> 48:11.840
..he doubles down.

48:11.840 --> 48:15.080
EMILY: Darvid clearly is just
all eyes on Brooke, nothing else.

48:15.080 --> 48:16.440
I am here for Brooke.

48:16.440 --> 48:18.520
I'm not just gonna ease
off the pedal and sit in the mansion

48:18.520 --> 48:22.120
and just be, like, "Cool" -
like, that's not my style at all.

48:22.120 --> 48:24.240
I'm in trouble, eh?

48:24.240 --> 48:26.280
Cool.

48:26.280 --> 48:28.280
