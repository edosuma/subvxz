10:36.937 --> 10:38.536
I got my accounts
to take care of,

10:38.638 --> 10:39.504
You know what I mean?

10:42.209 --> 10:43.742
All right.
Well, you know what, uh,

10:43.843 --> 10:45.310
Just give it some thought,
that's all.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.616
We're just...

10:51.618 --> 10:53.418
It's a family business,
trying to keep it that way.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.023
[phone ringing]

11:01.061 --> 11:02.994
[jeff] <i> what's up, my man?</i>

11:02.996 --> 11:05.630
Yeah, I don't think it's gonna
work out with shane.

11:05.632 --> 11:06.965
That's too bad, man.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.801
[josh] <i> any other islands</i>
<i> we can try?</i>

11:10.804 --> 11:13.238
[jeff] <i> we got one more optio</i>

11:13.339 --> 11:15.106
<i> Fishing grounds will probabl</i>
<i> be a lot less crowded</i>

11:15.108 --> 11:16.508
<i> Up in kauai</i>
<i> than they will in kona.</i>

11:17.644 --> 11:18.809
[josh speaking]

11:20.113 --> 11:21.646
[jeff] <i> it's a super,</i>
<i> super tight community.</i>

11:21.748 --> 11:22.813
<i> I might have a connection</i>

11:22.815 --> 11:24.249
<i> With a couple of the guys</i>
<i> there, though.</i>

11:25.252 --> 11:27.819
Rumor is that tuna bite
is insane.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.054
Well, we're all
out of options.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.523
So sounds like a plan.
Let's do that.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.426
[jeff]
<i> it's worth a shot, right?</i>

11:34.428 --> 11:35.894
Yup.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.128
<i> Let's head over to kauai.</i>

11:37.130 --> 11:39.464
<i> Let's see</i>
<i> what we can figure out.</i>

11:39.533 --> 11:41.032
[jeff] <i> all right, man,</i>
<i> I'll meet you there.</i>

11:41.101 --> 11:42.300
[josh] <i> see you after a bit.</i>

11:42.302 --> 11:43.401
Bye.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.807
[jeff] <i> you know,</i>
<i> josh is a family man.</i>

11:48.809 --> 11:50.942
<i> You know, his relationship</i>
<i> with his brother, shane,</i>

11:51.011 --> 11:53.044
<i> Is a little bit rocky.</i>

11:53.046 --> 11:55.847
<i> But I do know that</i>
<i> he definitely wants</i>

11:55.916 --> 11:57.849
<i> To amend that relationship.</i>

11:59.119 --> 12:00.351
<i> Everybody needs family.</i>

12:02.756 --> 12:03.955
[josh] <i> you know what they sa</i>

12:04.057 --> 12:07.125
<i> Blood is thicker than water</i>

12:07.127 --> 12:09.561
<i> It's hard to see my brother</i>
<i> for the first time in years</i>

12:09.662 --> 12:12.964
<i> And not think about</i>
<i> what could have been.</i>

12:15.736 --> 12:17.502
[phil] <i> me and those boys</i>
<i> have been through a lot</i>

12:17.504 --> 12:19.738
<i> In our lifetime, you know?</i>

12:19.806 --> 12:21.139
<i> A whole lot.</i>

12:21.708 --> 12:23.108
<i> And, uh...</i>

12:24.311 --> 12:25.744
<i> You know,</i>
<i> there's just a bond there</i>

12:25.812 --> 12:29.280
<i> That is never gonna be broke</i>

12:29.282 --> 12:33.051
<i> I mean it's just never</i>
<i> gonna be broke.</i>

12:33.053 --> 12:35.353
[josh] <i> I'd like to put</i>
<i> my relationship back</i>
<i> together with shane.</i>

12:36.123 --> 12:38.323
And someday maybe I will.

12:38.325 --> 12:41.126
But for now, I've got to rely
on my new family.

12:42.829 --> 12:46.030
<i> Another week,</i>
<i> another 3,000 pounds.</i>

12:47.601 --> 12:49.400
Kauai, here we come.

12:55.709 --> 12:56.608
[casey] <i> aloha.</i>

12:58.612 --> 12:59.811
Good timing, huh?

12:59.813 --> 13:01.112
[josh] hey, great timing.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.047
How you been, man?

13:03.049 --> 13:05.016
Good. Good. How are you?

13:05.018 --> 13:06.751
You know, we got a lot
to talk about.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.286
[casey] yeah?

13:08.288 --> 13:09.387
All good, I hope.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.823
[josh] <i> we've got another</i>
<i> 3,000 pounds</i>

13:11.825 --> 13:13.424
<i> Due for our clients back</i>
<i> in the mainland</i>

13:13.426 --> 13:15.360
<i> In just a few days.</i>

13:15.461 --> 13:17.629
<i> Jeff's idea to head up</i>
<i> the early tuna bite</i>

13:17.631 --> 13:19.130
<i> Right here</i>
<i> in the island of kauai.</i>

13:20.200 --> 13:21.299
<i> With any luck,</i>

13:21.301 --> 13:22.433
We could pick up the score

13:22.535 --> 13:23.535
Right before
they migrate south.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.738
[josh speaking]

13:29.009 --> 13:30.809
Jeff's trying to make some
inroads with the locals.

13:30.811 --> 13:31.943
We'll see how that goes.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.345
We need him to pull this off.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.416
[kodi] how's it going, man?

13:38.418 --> 13:39.217
[jeff] good. How you doing?

13:39.219 --> 13:40.184
[kodi] good, bro.

13:40.186 --> 13:42.720
[jeff]
thank you for having me over.

13:42.722 --> 13:43.822
-Of course.
-That your brother?

13:43.824 --> 13:46.357
Sup, alapai? Jeff.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.126
We just kind of came up
to just check out

13:48.128 --> 13:49.460
This bite up here in kauai.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.962
Kind of in a bind,
don't really know

13:51.064 --> 13:52.564
A lot of fishermen up here

13:52.665 --> 13:54.165
And, you know,
hear a lot of good things

13:54.234 --> 13:56.234
About you and your brother.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.837
<i> Every fishing community</i>
<i> in hawaii is different.</i>

13:58.938 --> 14:01.206
<i> Different methods,</i>
<i> different skillsets,</i>

14:01.208 --> 14:02.841
And kodi
and his brother alapai

14:02.942 --> 14:04.709
Are two of the best fishermen
I know in kauai.

14:04.711 --> 14:08.413
Getting their help to catch
this order would be huge.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.014
Just trying to find anybody
at this point

14:10.016 --> 14:11.149
That'll kind of
get us out there

14:11.251 --> 14:13.318
And maybe show us the grounds.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.519
What do you think?

14:18.325 --> 14:20.625
There's not a guarantee,
you know,

14:20.627 --> 14:22.193
That we're gonna be able
to fish with these guys.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.229
So, he's gonna go try
to feel them out.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.698
Hopefully, he comes up
with a little bit of help.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.634
[josh] help is hard to come
by these days.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.737
[casey] so, your brother
shut you down, huh?

14:32.839 --> 14:34.539
[josh]
I don't wanna talk about it.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.110
[jake]
I got an interesting visit.

14:42.716 --> 14:46.251
He, uh,
asked ya for some help?

14:46.352 --> 14:48.253
[shane] yes, he did.

14:48.354 --> 14:49.654
What do you think about that?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.024
[shane] not sure.

14:53.627 --> 14:55.927
10-4 suck, man.

14:56.763 --> 14:57.895
It ruined a lot of stuff.

14:57.997 --> 14:59.831
I think I would have probably
worked on this boat

14:59.833 --> 15:01.399
If it wasn't for that divorce,
honestly.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.201
I wanted it that bad,
because dude,

15:03.203 --> 15:04.502
Back in the day, that guy
had everything,

15:04.504 --> 15:07.472
Harley and corvette,
nice house.

15:07.474 --> 15:08.706
I thought it was
the coolest thing ever.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.408
I wanted to be like phil,
definitely.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.442
I tried it for five year.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.044
Well, I mean here's
the start right here.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.212
-[shane] yeah, I know, man.
-You know, all you got to do

15:14.214 --> 15:15.513
Is say yes and then, you know,

15:15.515 --> 15:17.115
That's just the start of, uh,

15:17.117 --> 15:19.851
The bigger picture
right there.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.220
[kodi] yeah, this could be
something we could do.

15:23.189 --> 15:24.756
Probably have to meet
josh and casey,

15:24.824 --> 15:26.658
See where they are
and what they're made of
and all that.

15:26.759 --> 15:27.659
Yeah.

15:27.727 --> 15:28.860
That's all I can ask for.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.561
-So, I appreciate it.
-All right, jeff.

15:30.663 --> 15:31.763
Thank you.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.164
[kodi] let's meet down
at the harbor.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.733
-[jeff] okay.
-[kodi] bright and early.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.502
[jake] <i> I don't know.</i>

15:37.504 --> 15:39.237
It's just been a long time.

15:39.339 --> 15:40.805
Long, long time.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.208
Definitely
consider it there, brother.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.412
I'll think about it.

15:51.117 --> 15:54.953
If we can't get fish faster,
it's over.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.125
<i> What's up, my man?</i>

16:01.127 --> 16:02.026
-[jeff] <i> casey.</i>
-[kodi] <i> kodi.</i>

16:02.028 --> 16:03.294
-[jeff] <i> josh.</i>
-[josh] <i> josh.</i>

16:03.296 --> 16:04.262
-[alapai] [indistinct] <i> alapa</i>
-[casey] <i> alapai.</i>

16:04.297 --> 16:05.563
<i> Casey. Nice to meet you, bro</i>

16:05.565 --> 16:06.431
[josh] <i> all right, bruh.</i>
<i> How you doing, bruh?</i>

16:08.201 --> 16:09.300
Before we dive into anything,

16:09.302 --> 16:10.935
What is it exactly you guys
are looking for?

16:13.640 --> 16:16.541
Last year in kona,
we got crushed,

16:16.609 --> 16:18.209
You know,
our market, our economy,

16:18.211 --> 16:19.944
Everything fell apart.

16:20.046 --> 16:22.347
So right now we're just trying
to kind of rebuild.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.816
I figured kind of work with
two local boys like yourself

16:24.818 --> 16:26.417
And get back on track.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.420
What's in it for you, guys?

16:31.958 --> 16:34.625
[josh] my dad had a dream
a long time ago

16:34.627 --> 16:37.695
And never got to fulfill it.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.164
We're hoping to keep
this dream alive.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.100
And you guys are some of
the best of the best over here

16:42.102 --> 16:43.835
And it's what
we're looking for.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.503
It's more people to work with

16:45.505 --> 16:47.605
And make sure that
we can accomplish this goal.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.809
What do you think?
You guys gonna give us a shot?

16:56.116 --> 16:57.415
Yeah. We could do that.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.217
Awesome.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.621
What's the plan?

17:03.623 --> 17:05.890
[casey] where do you guys
usually like to start?

17:05.892 --> 17:07.825
[jeff] tunas migrate down
from the northwest

17:07.827 --> 17:11.429
So we could shoot around
and check the nepali coast

17:11.431 --> 17:12.630
Because I heard
there's a rumor

17:12.632 --> 17:14.599
Of a decent bite down there.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.933
[casey] what do you say
we guys wrap this up

17:16.002 --> 17:18.503
And get out there while
we got morning bite, huh?

17:30.016 --> 17:32.517
<i> This is the na pali coast</i>
<i> of kauai.</i>

17:33.520 --> 17:35.453
It's unbelievable.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.821
Unbelievable, man.

17:40.226 --> 17:44.128
<i> The na pali coast is locate</i>
<i> on the west side of kauai.</i>

17:44.130 --> 17:46.564
<i> It's famous for</i>
<i> its jagged peaks,</i>

17:46.666 --> 17:49.934
<i> And it's also very rich</i>
<i> in hawaiian culture.</i>

17:49.936 --> 17:51.302
<i> But early in the summer,</i>

17:51.304 --> 17:53.037
<i> The coast is known</i>
<i> for something else...</i>

17:53.807 --> 17:54.806
Tuna run?

17:54.808 --> 17:55.940
Tuna run.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.411
<i> Yellowfins usually</i>
<i> start their season</i>

18:00.413 --> 18:02.313
<i> In the north part of</i>
<i> the hawaiian chain.</i>

18:02.315 --> 18:05.216
<i> As it progresses,</i>
<i> they migrate south to spawn</i>

18:05.218 --> 18:06.617
<i> Hopefully we can</i>
<i> pick them off</i>

18:06.619 --> 18:08.052
<i> Before they've left kauai.</i>

18:08.154 --> 18:11.222
Here we come, baby.
Let's do it.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.424
[casey] let's go snag
something cool.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.426
All right.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.561
Ready to drop these riggers?

18:16.662 --> 18:19.063
Yeah, let's do it.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.965
<i> We're used to doing</i>
<i> live bait and stuff.</i>

18:21.033 --> 18:23.601
Here,
we do fishing with lures.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.305
<i> Trolling is affected</i>
<i> because you're covering</i>

18:27.307 --> 18:28.539
A lot of ground.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.909
So, you wanna put out
multiple lures anywhere

18:31.911 --> 18:33.845
[indistinct] <i> four</i>
<i> and</i>  [indistinct] <i> six.</i>

18:33.913 --> 18:35.746
<i> Alapai's got kind of</i>
<i> a bigger boat.</i>

18:35.815 --> 18:37.448
<i> We're running seven lines.</i>

18:37.517 --> 18:39.617
You stand on a spread,
you know,

18:39.619 --> 18:42.620
Run some different colors,
run some different depths

18:42.622 --> 18:43.955
<i> And you can really</i>
<i> kind of troll</i>

18:44.056 --> 18:46.858
<i> All over the place</i>
<i> and look for signs of life.</i>

18:46.959 --> 18:49.060
Show me an ahi.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.806
[alapai] <i> we're kind of</i>
<i> looking around for birds.</i>

19:01.808 --> 19:04.041
Like a lot of times we've been
seeing the ahis roll around,

19:04.043 --> 19:05.643
So you'll see the sickle
come out of the water.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.154
There it is. There it is.
There it is.

19:16.222 --> 19:17.355
Caught that,
there it is [indistinct]

19:17.423 --> 19:18.823
[jeff] yeah, buddy!

19:23.730 --> 19:25.129
Let's get these lines
out of the way.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.264
We're on.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.701
I think they might be
hooked up,

19:30.703 --> 19:31.435
They're slowing down.

19:31.537 --> 19:34.038
See that?

19:34.040 --> 19:35.039
Yeah, they're back.
They're scrambling.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.941
They got something.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.843
Yeah, watch your back.
Watch your back.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.218
Feels like a really good fish.

19:47.220 --> 19:51.155
Feels like an ahi
took a lot of lines.

19:51.224 --> 19:54.926
I see him on the surface.

19:54.928 --> 19:57.228
He's still looking lively.

19:57.230 --> 20:00.131
<i> This guy is not even</i>
<i> getting tired.</i>

20:00.133 --> 20:01.399
<i> Guarantee ahi.</i>

20:01.401 --> 20:03.634
He looks about a hundred,
a hundred ten.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.336
He's teeter-tottering
a little bit.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.608
Here we go. We got him.
We got him surfing now.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.944
Up, up, up.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.716
-Got him.
-[man] yes.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.451
Two, three.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.754
All right.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.324
Nice fish.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.525
Hell, yeah.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.826
-[bleep]
-all right, my brother.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.027
-You got him.
-[indistinct]

20:30.029 --> 20:31.629
Number one down,
that's the hardest one.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.730
[indistinct]

20:32.732 --> 20:35.499
First ahi in kauai.

20:35.501 --> 20:36.801
Nice.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.604
I mean,
we got something going.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.139
<i> We got a healthy 110.</i>

20:42.208 --> 20:43.808
Let's go get another one.

20:46.045 --> 20:49.513
[casey] now, we need an ahi.
Where's our yellows?

20:49.515 --> 20:51.282
Are you still seeing anything
on the sonar?

20:51.284 --> 20:52.617
Not really.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.752
It's kind of quieting down
[indistinct]

20:59.058 --> 21:01.525
[josh]
<i> the weather's coming up.</i>

21:01.527 --> 21:03.894
[man] <i> that's not good.</i>

21:03.896 --> 21:06.631
But we gotta keep
grinding it out, man.

21:06.633 --> 21:10.001
Well, that's all we can do.

21:10.003 --> 21:11.702
<i> We got a lot more to catch.</i>

21:17.310 --> 21:18.342
[casey] all right, run.

21:21.014 --> 21:23.614
[bleep] okay. Pull.

21:25.818 --> 21:28.552
He's running. He's running.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.721
Get that [indistinct] there.

21:33.726 --> 21:36.127
Oh, it looks like
they're fighting a fish
over there.

21:37.263 --> 21:38.462
I'll bring it up
closer to you,

21:38.531 --> 21:40.197
You do this thing
and I'll gaff it, okay?

21:40.199 --> 21:41.499
All right, dude.

21:41.501 --> 21:42.933
Okay. You grab that.
I'm gonna grab some gaff.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.302
[indistinct]

21:44.304 --> 21:46.337
Careful, careful.

21:46.406 --> 21:47.638
-[casey] oh.
-[bleep]

21:47.707 --> 21:49.140
Man overboard.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.345
[casey] all right, run.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.579
I'll bring it up close to you,

21:55.581 --> 21:57.315
You do this thing
and I'll gaff it, okay?

21:57.317 --> 21:58.716
[josh] all right, dude.

21:58.718 --> 21:59.850
[casey] okay. You grab that.
I'm gonna grab the gaff.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.619
-[josh] all right.
-[indistinct]

22:01.621 --> 22:03.454
Careful. Careful.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.822
-Oh.
-[man] [bleep]

22:04.824 --> 22:07.558
Man overboard.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.726
Oh [bleep]

22:08.728 --> 22:10.328
Josh just fell on the water,
guys.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.562
Oh [bleep]

22:11.664 --> 22:12.530
[man] go ahead over there
and check him out.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.398
Sounds good.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.200
[casey] holy [bleep]

22:19.405 --> 22:21.706
I'm gonna [indistinct] up,
let him run away a little.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.541
Yeah, I'm [indistinct]

22:25.545 --> 22:26.811
[bleep]

22:30.249 --> 22:32.483
Good?

22:32.485 --> 22:34.518
-[josh] oh, my god.
-What did you do?

22:37.423 --> 22:39.657
[bleep]

22:39.726 --> 22:41.325
-[casey] you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

22:41.327 --> 22:42.727
[casey] did you slip?

22:44.497 --> 22:47.064
[indistinct] fishing.

22:48.601 --> 22:49.500
Is that marlin?

22:49.502 --> 22:52.837
Whoa. There he goes again.

22:52.938 --> 22:54.338
Gotta be a marlin.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.278
[bleep] I tripped, dude.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.213
[bleep]

23:02.215 --> 23:03.848
I think we lost a fish, too.

23:05.651 --> 23:08.619
-[bleep]
-[kodi] we lost the fish?

23:08.621 --> 23:11.021
[casey] we lost the fish.
He spit the hook.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.223
I... No, it was my fault.

23:12.225 --> 23:13.524
I slacked him off
when you went in

23:13.526 --> 23:15.126
'cause I didn't want him
to come up by you

23:15.128 --> 23:18.763
-And chop you in half.
-Dude, I'm sorry.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.664
<i> We're gonna catch</i>
<i> our 28,000 lbs this week,</i>

23:20.700 --> 23:23.300
You know, you're gonna have to
stay like in the boat, right?

23:23.302 --> 23:25.803
That was like a freak wave,
though.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.138
-It's full.
-Yeah, it's huge.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.040
-Must have been a 20-footer.
-It was. Probably.

23:30.142 --> 23:31.642
-Yeah.
-They were big out there.

23:31.744 --> 23:32.843
Uh-huh.

23:34.614 --> 23:35.813
[laughs]

23:38.017 --> 23:39.417
[jeff ] I'm happy
you're okay, man.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.952
That could have been
really bad, josh.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.221
Dude, one of those hooks
gets into you or something,

23:44.223 --> 23:47.124
I mean, this thing,
look at the size of that.

23:48.628 --> 23:49.760
That thing would
butcher you up

23:49.796 --> 23:52.329
If it got into you out there.

23:52.331 --> 23:55.633
I think we had enough
fun for today.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.501
Catching that fish tomorrow,
huh?

23:57.503 --> 24:00.037
Yeah.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.306
[jeff] <i> you know, we're unde</i>
<i> a lot of pressure right now</i>

24:02.308 --> 24:05.042
<i> And I think</i>
<i> specifically josh is.</i>

24:05.044 --> 24:06.510
<i> And he just really</i>
<i> wants to impress</i>

24:06.512 --> 24:07.711
<i> Some of these clients</i>
<i> that he is, you know,</i>

24:07.713 --> 24:09.213
<i> Promising fish to.</i>

24:09.215 --> 24:13.050
But more than anything, man,
it's safety first, you know.

24:15.521 --> 24:17.054
You scared the [bleep]
out of me, dude.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.825
Scared the [bleep]
out of myself.

24:23.162 --> 24:26.964
Humiliation and embarrassment
is at an all-time high.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.735
Yeah. It's time to [bleep]
get out of here.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.941
[josh]
now what's he doing here?

24:39.812 --> 24:41.512
What happened to you?

24:41.514 --> 24:43.013
Why are you all wet?

24:43.015 --> 24:46.417
Well, it's been a long day
today, pal.

24:46.419 --> 24:47.551
What are you doing here?

24:47.587 --> 24:49.220
I thought you couldn't
come out?

24:49.222 --> 24:50.921
Well, I thought about it

24:50.923 --> 24:54.325
And, uh, I wanna
show you something.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.460
Yeah, all right.

24:56.529 --> 24:58.562
Hey, guys, my brother shane.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.130
-[indistinct] shane.
-Shane, casey.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.233
-Casey, nice to meet you, man.
-Nice to meet you brother.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.702
-Jeff.
-Hello, jeff.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.103
-Nice to meet you, man.
-Nice to meet you.

25:06.105 --> 25:08.405
-Hold up.
-[josh] all right.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.007
Well, let me finish
tying up the boat here

25:10.009 --> 25:11.242
And get my stuff together

25:11.343 --> 25:13.043
And then, uh, we'll go
over to my place.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.712
-All right. See you, guys.
-[indistinct] brother.

25:17.717 --> 25:20.317
This day just keeps getting
weird and weirder.

25:22.522 --> 25:25.623
<i> All right. What we got?</i>

25:25.625 --> 25:27.958
[shane] <i> check this out.</i>

25:28.027 --> 25:32.763
[bleep]

25:32.831 --> 25:34.298
Is that with my mom now?

25:34.300 --> 25:36.333
[shane] that would be
my chunky butt there.

25:36.435 --> 25:38.035
[josh] boy,
you were a fat baby.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.236
[shane] I was, dude.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.038
[josh] now you're
[indistinct] [bleep]

25:41.040 --> 25:42.039
[laughter]

25:42.141 --> 25:43.607
Lot of milk. Lot of milk.

25:43.609 --> 25:46.810
[laugh] oh, my gosh.
That's impressive.

25:46.812 --> 25:48.646
<i> Shane's had this box</i>
<i> of old stuff</i>

25:48.714 --> 25:52.283
<i> Sitting in his garage</i>
<i> for over a decade.</i>

25:52.285 --> 25:54.118
<i> And his greatest</i>
<i> memory lane is</i>

25:54.120 --> 25:55.719
Maybe there's something
in there that can shed light

25:55.721 --> 25:57.955
In what the old
man's plans were.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.523
What else we got in there?

25:59.525 --> 26:02.726
Uh, I got some letters
and stuff from the old man.

26:02.728 --> 26:05.563
What is that matchbook though?

26:05.631 --> 26:09.099
Coco palms.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.734
Interesting.

26:10.836 --> 26:12.937
Is that me as a baby?

26:13.005 --> 26:14.038
[shane] oh, yeah,
that's definitely you.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.940
-[laughs] no way.
-[shane] yeah.

26:16.041 --> 26:19.543
God, I was [bleep] ugly, man.

26:19.645 --> 26:20.945
Taken April 27th...

26:21.013 --> 26:21.979
[shane] yeah,
five weeks old you were.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.213
1983.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.149
That is insane.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.151
Dude, I thought you were
the cutest little thing

26:27.252 --> 26:28.352
-The first time I...
-No, you know what

26:28.454 --> 26:30.454
My dad told me
right before he died?

26:30.523 --> 26:32.623
He goes, "you know, josh,
when you were born,"

26:32.625 --> 26:34.558
He goes, "...I used to
carry this picture around,

26:34.627 --> 26:36.026
I thought you're
the most beautiful thing.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.128
I showed it to everybody.
"he goes, "I ran into it,

26:38.130 --> 26:40.230
That same picture,
right before I left

26:40.232 --> 26:43.634
Because you were the ugliest
[bleep] baby I've ever seen.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.636
"and he goes, "I can't
believe I showed everybody

26:45.705 --> 26:48.439
-This picture of you."
-[laughs]

26:50.309 --> 26:51.609
Sup, guys? How you doing?

26:51.611 --> 26:54.445
Oh, shane brought over
a box of random stuff

26:54.513 --> 26:56.046
That are pictures and photos

26:56.115 --> 26:57.948
-Of my dad's that he had.
-[jeff] small memories.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.450
-[man] yeah.
-Oh, worth treasures, huh?

27:02.388 --> 27:03.721
Is this your mom?

27:03.723 --> 27:04.855
[josh] yeah, that's my mom.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.790
[jeff] well, she's pretty.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.325
You're a sucker.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.760
-That was him.
-[jeff] oh.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.962
-[shane] that's me, yeah.
-[jeff] mmm-hmm.

27:12.031 --> 27:15.032
<i> I don't know everything</i>
<i> about josh and shane's past</i>

27:15.034 --> 27:17.401
<i> But I do know that</i>
<i> there's been some tension.</i>

27:17.403 --> 27:19.036
<i> But if you flew</i>
<i> all the way here,</i>

27:19.038 --> 27:22.806
There's gotta be some desire
to put their past behind them.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.541
All right,
check this out, though,

27:24.643 --> 27:27.144
Here in kauai,
you know all about this place,

27:27.213 --> 27:29.546
Coco palms?

27:29.615 --> 27:32.149
[jeff] coco palms, yeah,
that was a hotel in wailua.

27:32.251 --> 27:35.452
Got... Got destroyed
in hurricane iniki.

27:35.488 --> 27:37.121
[josh] yeah.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.322
[jeff] <i> back in, uh...</i>

27:38.324 --> 27:41.659
[josh] <i> is it '93, '94?</i>

27:41.760 --> 27:43.027
[jeff]
<i> ever since the hurricane,</i>

27:43.029 --> 27:46.664
<i> They never...</i>
<i> They never rebuilt it.</i>

27:46.732 --> 27:48.799
[casey] coco palms.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.901
That's where they filmed, uh,
elvis's <i> blue hawaii,</i>

27:50.903 --> 27:52.036
That is coco palms.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.837
-[josh] really?
-[casey] yeah.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.205
[josh] look at this though.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.041
Looks like a phone number
I think the old man got

27:57.109 --> 27:58.942
From some hot chick probably.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.211
[jeff] no.
That's not a phone number.

28:01.213 --> 28:02.513
-It's a long numbers.
-[josh] yeah.

28:02.515 --> 28:05.315
Those are coordinates, dude.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.117
[josh] are you sure it's not
an international number?

28:07.119 --> 28:09.319
[jeff]
that's too many numbers.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.955
Let's have a check.

28:12.057 --> 28:14.258
So what was the numbers again?

28:14.326 --> 28:16.560
21, 51, 32.

28:16.595 --> 28:19.730
21, 51, 32

28:19.732 --> 28:21.899
Would be right in this area,
okay.

28:21.901 --> 28:25.502
Your lateral's gonna be 160,
36.

28:25.504 --> 28:30.240
That puts us
right about there.

28:31.544 --> 28:34.144
Uh, kodi.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.180
The only thing
about this area here,

28:36.182 --> 28:38.048
That's off of
[indistinct] point,

28:38.117 --> 28:40.684
Off of ni'ihau and there's
nice pinnacle out there

28:40.686 --> 28:43.253
That could be pretty
productive for ahis.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.155
Also there's a really nice
ledge drop off

28:45.224 --> 28:47.458
That runs all the way along
down the south point,

28:47.559 --> 28:50.961
Can be really good for onos.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.262
[josh] <i> we know from the char</i>

28:52.364 --> 28:53.731
<i> My dad was up and down</i>
<i> these islands,</i>

28:53.733 --> 28:55.799
<i> You know, for years</i>
<i> during the '80s,</i>

28:55.801 --> 28:57.801
<i> Including kauai.</i>

28:57.803 --> 29:00.604
Some spots he got to,
some spots he didn't.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.606
There's no marks out
by ni'ihau,

29:02.608 --> 29:04.308
But if you wrote down
these numbers,

29:04.310 --> 29:06.944
<i> That means it was some plac</i>
<i> you wanted to go.</i>

29:06.946 --> 29:08.512
There's no dock on ni'ihau,

29:08.514 --> 29:10.414
That's, uh,
the forbidden island.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.216
No one's allowed
to get up on it.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.017
It's got a native
hawaiian population.

29:14.019 --> 29:17.287
They have their own
hawaiian community

29:17.289 --> 29:21.158
That's maybe a hundred people
or less.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.427
And the [indistinct] a little
less [indistinct] than kauai,

29:23.429 --> 29:24.661
A little farther to reach.

29:24.763 --> 29:25.729
[casey] do you guys go out
there often?

29:25.731 --> 29:27.064
[kodi] not too often.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.399
We do sometimes
but it takes for a long day.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.936
[jeff]
so what do you guys think?

29:32.938 --> 29:35.205
[josh] I think
it sounds good, you know.

29:35.207 --> 29:36.306
[casey] I'm totally down.

29:36.308 --> 29:37.207
-Let's do it.
-[jeff] perfect.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.408
Now that we got shane here,

29:38.410 --> 29:39.610
We have three guys
on each boat

29:39.612 --> 29:40.944
So two guys
come around the deck.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.146
I don't think, uh,
he's gonna...

29:42.247 --> 29:43.514
He just came up to bring,
you know,

29:43.516 --> 29:44.848
Some of the stuff up

29:44.950 --> 29:46.049
And then we just got to check
some stuff out.

29:46.151 --> 29:49.019
Uh, it's, you know,
I came up here to help,

29:49.021 --> 29:50.687
So let's do it.

29:50.689 --> 29:53.724
[casey] do you actually fish?

29:53.726 --> 29:55.659
I used to fish
a long time ago.

29:55.761 --> 29:56.827
He's a fast learner.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.462
It's like riding a bike,
you know?

29:58.530 --> 30:00.330
You catch one fish
five years ago,

30:00.332 --> 30:03.033
You catch another one
ten years ago, whatever.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.035
[laughs]

30:05.104 --> 30:08.839
[dramatic music playing]

30:08.941 --> 30:10.207
[jonathan]
who's going with who?

30:10.209 --> 30:12.042
Thank god me and jeff
will be going with you.

30:12.044 --> 30:13.911
Shane and casey
going with alapai

30:13.913 --> 30:15.712
And, uh, we'll get out there
and rock this, man.

30:15.714 --> 30:17.014
-[casey] let's do it.
-[jeff] good luck, boys.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.916
Good luck, you guys.

30:18.918 --> 30:22.119
Casey taught me [indistinct]
ropes up here fishing

30:22.121 --> 30:24.955
So it'd be good [indistinct]
from my older brother.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.057
We'll get to train
[indistinct] [laughs]

30:27.125 --> 30:29.126
Dude, if we catch
enough fish today,

30:29.128 --> 30:30.427
We'll be able
to make enough money

30:30.429 --> 30:31.295
And get you a shirt
with sleeves on it.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.863
[laughter]

30:32.965 --> 30:34.331
[josh] <i> listen,</i>
<i> don't haze him too bad.</i>

30:34.333 --> 30:35.833
He flew a long way
to come out here

30:35.934 --> 30:37.801
To help us out, you know?

30:37.803 --> 30:39.803
-Me haze somebody?
-[laughs]

30:39.805 --> 30:41.305
I would never give anybody
a hard time.

30:41.307 --> 30:42.239
Yeah, yeah.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.507
Never.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.042
What are you getting
on the boat for?

30:45.143 --> 30:47.945
You got to throw the lines.
That's what a deckhand does.

30:48.046 --> 30:49.112
Are you serious? All right.

30:49.114 --> 30:51.748
[josh] you start him off
right there, huh?

30:51.817 --> 30:55.118
[man] <i> no, not</i>  [indistinct]
<i> blue lights.</i>

30:55.120 --> 30:57.654
<i> When my old man wrote those</i>
<i> numbers on the matchbook,</i>

30:57.723 --> 31:00.190
<i> It was a totally</i>
<i> different time.</i>

31:00.192 --> 31:03.327
It was before the divorce,
it was before shane left.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.829
I don't know what it means,
but I've been doing this

31:05.831 --> 31:08.632
<i> Too long to believe</i>
<i> in coincidences.</i>

31:08.734 --> 31:10.400
Of course
it doesn't mean a thing

31:10.402 --> 31:12.436
If we can't land some tuna
by Wednesday.

31:12.504 --> 31:15.105
Help us out, pops.

31:15.107 --> 31:17.441
<i> We're heading</i>
<i> to the forbidden island.</i>

31:17.542 --> 31:19.509
[dramatic music playing]

31:23.649 --> 31:25.215
[indistinct] on the matchbook

31:25.217 --> 31:27.050
And bringing you out
to nowhere.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.320
<i> Oh, man, I had coordinates</i>

31:30.322 --> 31:31.822
<i> That point towards</i>
<i> fishing grounds</i>

31:31.824 --> 31:33.724
<i> Off the island of ni'ihau.</i>

31:33.726 --> 31:36.393
<i> He marked it down</i>
<i> as a place to explore.</i>

31:36.395 --> 31:37.628
<i> From what I learned,</i>

31:37.630 --> 31:39.429
He wanted to sell fish
in vegas, too,

31:39.431 --> 31:41.598
But not 3,000 lbs. A week.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.401
[dramatic music playing]

31:44.403 --> 31:45.903
[casey] <i> if I can get this</i>
[indistinct]

31:45.905 --> 31:47.204
I'm gonna have to check
these hooks, right?

31:47.206 --> 31:48.805
Yeah, so you know
what you're looking for

31:48.807 --> 31:50.407
-When you're checking them?
-[indistinct] he showed me,

31:50.409 --> 31:53.010
But how did you get it open
like you did?

31:53.012 --> 31:55.012
<i> This was twisted</i>
<i> and goof ball</i>

31:55.014 --> 31:57.347
Or flipped upside down
around that.

31:57.449 --> 32:00.017
This thing has to hang
absolutely [indistinct]

32:00.019 --> 32:02.052
That's correct.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.520
<i> Okay, so how much time</i>
<i> did your brother</i>

32:03.522 --> 32:06.423
Actually spend fishing?

32:06.425 --> 32:08.225
That's a good question.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.027
He just came out here,

32:10.029 --> 32:13.063
He came out here
to do whatever he can do.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.499
Well, kind of feels like
we're throwing him

32:15.501 --> 32:17.434
Into the fire on this one.

32:17.503 --> 32:19.703
<i> Shane and I haven't already</i>
<i> spoken in years.</i>

32:19.705 --> 32:21.505
Too much resentment.

32:21.507 --> 32:24.608
The old man taught him
how to fish years before me.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.444
But, uh, I don't really know
how much he remembers.

32:27.513 --> 32:30.514
[dramatic music playing]

32:32.818 --> 32:34.618
<i> It's pretty special</i>
<i> pulling up to, uh, you know</i>

32:34.620 --> 32:37.521
<i> An island like this,</i>
<i> there's no houses,</i>

32:37.523 --> 32:39.957
There's no hotels,

32:39.959 --> 32:42.326
There's nothing, you know.

32:42.328 --> 32:43.760
<i> It's pretty special</i>
<i> that they're still able</i>

32:43.862 --> 32:45.429
<i> To preserve an island</i>
<i> like this, you know,</i>

32:45.431 --> 32:46.930
That's doing what they can

32:46.932 --> 32:49.833
To protect what's left
of hawaiian culture.

32:49.902 --> 32:53.036
<i> Whoever gets to see this,</i>
<i> I don't know anyone, man,</i>

32:53.038 --> 32:56.139
<i> It's... We are lucky</i>
<i> on that and blessed.</i>

32:56.208 --> 32:58.608
Absolutely blessed to be here.

32:58.610 --> 33:04.414
[dramatic music playing]

33:04.416 --> 33:06.483
All right, boys, you see
a good bite off of this point.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.051
-So let's get set up.
-[shane] all right.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.487
[casey] all right.
Hey, let's get fishing.

33:10.489 --> 33:11.855
[josh] let's do it.

33:13.025 --> 33:16.426
[jeff] that's it.
Get up, buddy.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.530
<i> We're working this one area</i>

33:20.532 --> 33:21.865
There's different
little banks,

33:21.933 --> 33:23.600
Like, little mountains
that are formed

33:23.602 --> 33:25.602
And, you know, we've noticed
on these mountains,

33:25.604 --> 33:26.937
<i> Like, we were finding</i>
<i> these birds</i>

33:26.939 --> 33:28.105
<i> And all these baits</i>

33:28.107 --> 33:29.940
So these underwater structures

33:30.042 --> 33:32.042
That are kind of
in the channel
between the islands,

33:32.044 --> 33:34.111
<i> Fuels the current</i>
<i> with all these bait balls</i>

33:34.113 --> 33:35.912
<i> And these birds</i>
<i> and</i>  [indistinct]

33:35.914 --> 33:37.814
So we're ready.

33:37.816 --> 33:38.949
Just waiting for it now.

33:39.018 --> 33:39.816
Looks good though.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.818
[beeping]

33:50.029 --> 33:50.961
[line whirring]

33:51.030 --> 33:53.130
Oh, I think we're on.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.298
We're on. We're on, dude.

33:55.300 --> 33:59.036
All right. Fish on.

33:59.137 --> 34:00.404
What it is,
we're not quite sure

34:00.406 --> 34:02.239
What it is yet but...

34:02.340 --> 34:06.309
Hey, man, looks like josh
is hooked up right now, casey.

34:06.311 --> 34:08.512
You wanna try gaffing him?

34:08.514 --> 34:09.746
It's all here.
I'll bring him up.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.014
You try to gaff him.
Good. Good.

34:11.016 --> 34:13.417
-[indistinct]
-[jeff] got it.

34:13.419 --> 34:14.551
[josh] try to get him
in the head, okay?

34:14.653 --> 34:15.952
Remember,
every fish is important.

34:16.021 --> 34:18.121
-[jeff] got it.
-[josh] you ready?

34:18.123 --> 34:20.624
[indistinct]

34:20.626 --> 34:22.225
[jeff] good job, man.

34:22.227 --> 34:25.128
This is a kava
kava, skipjack family,

34:25.130 --> 34:27.464
Similar to an [indistinct]

34:27.566 --> 34:29.232
That's a nice one man.

34:29.334 --> 34:30.801
Not the biggest fish
but you know what?

34:30.803 --> 34:32.035
We'll take anything
we can get.

34:32.137 --> 34:32.936
We'll take anything
we can get tonight.

34:32.938 --> 34:34.404
Good. [laughs]

34:34.406 --> 34:36.807
<i> One in the box.</i>

34:36.809 --> 34:38.208
It's a good warm up.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.343
Get this order fulfilled,
and hopefully get back

34:40.412 --> 34:43.313
To the good graces of barry,
fingers crossed.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.048
We can do this.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.286
[man] <i> fish</i>  [indistinct]
<i> around the board, right?</i>

34:49.288 --> 34:51.721
And these are
starting to bite.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.957
-Let's do this.
-It's our turn.

34:54.026 --> 34:55.325
<i> I'm calling that</i>
[bleep] <i> 30 minutes</i>

34:55.327 --> 34:57.527
<i> We're gonna have</i>
<i> something on.</i>

34:57.529 --> 35:00.330
Oh, my god, we're on.
We're on. We're on.

35:00.332 --> 35:01.298
Oh. I got [indistinct]

35:01.300 --> 35:04.301
[line whirring]

35:04.303 --> 35:06.403
[casey] yeah. Woo-hoo.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.709
They're hooked into something.

35:12.711 --> 35:14.044
Lucky bastards.

35:14.046 --> 35:15.512
-Yeah.
-[laughs]

35:15.514 --> 35:19.149
[kodi] [indistinct]
fish right here.

35:19.251 --> 35:20.917
[josh] oh, here it is.

35:20.919 --> 35:23.053
-[kodi] this might be an ulua.
-I think we got an ulua.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.822
[dramatic music playing]

35:25.824 --> 35:28.325
[kodi] all right.
That's good. Good.

35:29.828 --> 35:30.560
[bleep]

35:30.629 --> 35:33.797
[dramatic music playing]

35:33.799 --> 35:35.232
[kodi] all right.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.703
That's the one the chef
wants right there, huh?

35:39.705 --> 35:41.805
So you got there a sashimi.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.340
Doing [bleep] brother.

35:43.408 --> 35:44.508
All right. Good work, josh.

35:44.510 --> 35:47.110
Oh, man. Let get warmed up.

35:47.112 --> 35:49.012
-Oh.
-We're on.

35:49.014 --> 35:50.614
Dude. Another one?

35:51.550 --> 35:52.516
[josh] one...

35:54.419 --> 35:55.719
[jeff] yeah.

35:55.721 --> 35:58.155
That's just a good thing
we need,

35:58.223 --> 35:59.322
The quantity.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.125
-Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
-[jeff] good. Good.

36:02.127 --> 36:03.527
Grab the gaff. Grab the gaff.

36:03.529 --> 36:04.561
There we go.

36:04.630 --> 36:05.729
Good size ono.

36:11.403 --> 36:12.402
Hold on.

36:13.305 --> 36:14.304
Hold on.

36:15.307 --> 36:16.439
[bleep]

36:18.443 --> 36:19.576
-[laughter]
-[bleep]

36:19.644 --> 36:20.710
Go take him.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.245
Go [bleep] take him.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.380
Go take him.

36:23.382 --> 36:24.714
All right. It's over.

36:24.716 --> 36:25.715
Good job.

36:25.717 --> 36:26.750
That's a nice one.

36:26.818 --> 36:27.851
-[indistinct]
-stay safe, boys.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.119
Stay safe.

36:29.121 --> 36:31.188
[bleep]

36:31.190 --> 36:32.856
That was the worst gaff job.

36:32.925 --> 36:34.724
I'm getting whacked up
in the face.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.226
I was just about to say
you're getting better.

36:36.228 --> 36:38.028
[casey] [indistinct]
good job for josh.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.696
Here, you wanna grab
that gaff?

36:39.698 --> 36:41.064
No, I think
we should show everybody

36:41.066 --> 36:42.599
-Where that gaff is at.
-[laughter]

36:42.601 --> 36:43.900
[jeff] I think we should...

36:43.902 --> 36:46.136
I think that
that was going on the wall.

36:46.238 --> 36:47.137
But you know what?

36:47.206 --> 36:48.939
Get those out of the way now.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.141
And then when really
get on them

36:51.210 --> 36:52.742
We won't be doing that
anymore.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.211
-Oh.
-We'll let your try it.

36:54.213 --> 36:55.512
Well, [indistinct]

36:55.514 --> 36:58.348
You get...You get...
You get one of those.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.617
[josh] <i> just got to ni'ihau</i>
<i> and we already popped off</i>

37:00.619 --> 37:03.253
<i> Three species</i>
<i> that we needed for vegas.</i>

37:03.355 --> 37:05.655
But we don't have
a ton of poundage

37:05.757 --> 37:07.624
[indistinct] is still out
of the old man's matchbook

37:07.626 --> 37:08.625
That's gonna pay off.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.362
[shane] first day,
not so good.

37:13.465 --> 37:15.165
I come out here
to give my brother a hand

37:15.233 --> 37:16.399
But so far,

37:16.401 --> 37:19.402
These hands have not done
anything today.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.906
[casey] no bites, no looks.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.941
Birds around
like things look good.

37:26.211 --> 37:27.944
This is ain't happening.

37:29.248 --> 37:31.014
The fish are winning.

37:31.016 --> 37:32.382
The fish are winning.

37:32.384 --> 37:34.818
First day we ever take shane
out here on the water

37:35.921 --> 37:37.420
And I'm pretty sure
he's not impressed

37:37.422 --> 37:38.955
With our whole operation
thus far about...

37:39.024 --> 37:40.824
How we catch fish in hawaii.

37:44.229 --> 37:45.362
On.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.529
[casey] we're on.

37:48.300 --> 37:49.799
Hey, get over here.
This is your first fish.

37:49.801 --> 37:50.800
I'll take care of that.

37:50.802 --> 37:51.801
[indistinct] now.

37:51.803 --> 37:52.802
Big fish.

37:55.107 --> 37:57.040
Wait, is that shark
right there?

37:57.142 --> 37:58.808
[casey] I think
this is a big tuna.

37:58.810 --> 38:01.711
[shane] oh [bleep]
[indistinct] get this guy.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.514
[casey] hang on. Hang on.
Don't pull just yet.

38:05.484 --> 38:06.716
Okay. Start pulling.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.055
It's a fight, brother.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.423
It's a fight right here.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.826
It [indistinct] wants to live.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.732
[josh] it's been 20 plus years

38:22.834 --> 38:24.034
Since my brother's
been out on the boat.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.201
The last time he did,

38:25.203 --> 38:26.803
He got sick
for 10 days straight.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.138
He gets seasick?

38:28.206 --> 38:31.641
He did but, I mean,
people get over that.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.543
-[jeff] wanna call him?
-[josh] [indistinct]

38:33.645 --> 38:34.811
-[bleep]

38:34.813 --> 38:36.246
-Let see how he's doing.
-[josh] do it.

38:37.349 --> 38:38.615
What's going on, bro?

38:38.617 --> 38:40.817
[josh] <i> hey,</i>
<i> how you doing, buddy?</i>

38:40.819 --> 38:42.419
[shane]

38:42.421 --> 38:45.021
<i> Since I've been on a boat.</i>
<i> So...</i>

38:45.023 --> 38:46.222

38:47.626 --> 38:49.326
-I'm gonna...

38:55.200 --> 38:57.133
Oh.

Oh [bleep]

38:58.704 --> 39:00.136
[josh] we got a puker.

39:00.238 --> 39:01.304
He's feeding the fishes.

39:01.306 --> 39:02.305
-Oh, oh man.
-Oh.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.709
<i> Oh, my god.</i>

39:05.711 --> 39:07.711

Go, go, go, go!

39:09.514 --> 39:12.248

39:12.350 --> 39:14.517
Casey, you're going to hell,
dude.

39:14.519 --> 39:15.952
[laughs]

39:17.189 --> 39:18.655
Yee-haw!

39:20.058 --> 39:21.224
[shane] it's a fight, brother.

39:22.427 --> 39:23.960
[indistinct] he wants to live.

39:24.029 --> 39:27.030
[tense music playing]

39:30.902 --> 39:32.135

Get him.

39:37.409 --> 39:38.408
I know. I'm working.

39:38.410 --> 39:41.411
[tense music playing]

39:41.413 --> 39:42.712
[shane]

39:45.917 --> 39:47.083

39:47.085 --> 39:48.318
-[casey] hey!
-Yeah.

39:48.320 --> 39:50.320
-Woo-hoo!
-Oh, yeah, boy [indistinct]

39:50.322 --> 39:51.488
-Yellow tuna.
-First yellow buddy.

39:51.490 --> 39:52.622
[shane] oh, yeah.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.957
[casey]
you know what that means.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.825
[shane] oh [bleep]

39:55.827 --> 39:57.227
Let's go, man.

39:57.229 --> 39:59.028
Things I cheer for.

39:59.030 --> 40:00.530
[jeff]
<i> we have a tradition here</i>

40:00.532 --> 40:02.732
<i> That the first time</i>
<i> you catch a tuna with us,</i>

40:02.834 --> 40:04.734
-What are you gonna do?
-You got to eat the heart.

40:04.836 --> 40:07.036
-You got to eat the heart.
-Oh.

40:07.105 --> 40:08.338
[shane] woo-hoo!

40:08.440 --> 40:10.807
It's that time, pal,
to earn your stripes.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.309
Good luck.

40:13.311 --> 40:15.211
It pays respects to the ocean

40:15.213 --> 40:16.646
And it also brings good luck.

40:19.317 --> 40:21.418
Oh, let's see how [indistinct]
see how he's beating?

40:22.954 --> 40:24.421
-That one is big.
-Look at the beat.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.323
All right, buddy,

40:27.325 --> 40:28.958
First yellow heart
right there.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.227
[shane] god.

40:32.297 --> 40:36.966
-Got to eat it.
-It's the first real ahi.

40:36.968 --> 40:38.234
Finger bite,
bigger bite in that

40:38.336 --> 40:40.036
[indistinct] half the heart.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.106
Just one more bigger bite
if you want.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.641
-Oh, god.
-[josh retches]

40:44.742 --> 40:46.810
[casey] [indistinct] yeah,
swallow it too.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.211
[indistinct]
if you swallow it.

40:49.514 --> 40:50.747
Do it like you really mean it.

40:50.849 --> 40:52.215
[alapai] here,
I'll take a bite with you.

40:55.353 --> 40:58.321
[indistinct] together.

40:58.323 --> 40:59.422
[josh] oh, my gosh.

40:59.424 --> 41:00.790
[laughs]

41:00.792 --> 41:02.225
Oh.

41:02.227 --> 41:03.827
-[indistinct]
-yo, man, I'm done.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.033
-Oh.
-You guys good?

41:10.035 --> 41:11.835
Let's just go,
let's just get this going.

41:11.936 --> 41:13.102
I don't wanna hear any more
about this.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.604
-Nice job, brother.
-Good job, boys.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.206
You did better than I did.

41:16.208 --> 41:18.608
You know,
as gross as it might be...

41:18.610 --> 41:20.844
Oh, oh, oh, oh, holy [bleep]

41:20.912 --> 41:22.645
-We're on. We're on.
-[casey] oh.

41:22.747 --> 41:25.248
Never ever second guess
a superstition.

41:26.218 --> 41:27.217
It's on.

41:28.420 --> 41:30.220
We're gonna double hook up
right now or what,

41:30.222 --> 41:31.821
We're not sure but...

41:31.823 --> 41:34.023
It's coming up as we speak.

41:36.361 --> 41:37.527
Wow.

41:37.529 --> 41:38.561
Nice one.

41:39.464 --> 41:41.130
Awesome. Good job.

41:41.132 --> 41:42.799
All right.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.400
There.

41:44.402 --> 41:45.802
Get another one.

41:45.804 --> 41:47.237
[casey] oh, yeah.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.505
Oh yeah.

41:52.611 --> 41:53.943
[alapai]
we got ourselves an ono.

41:53.945 --> 41:55.812
[casey] attaboy.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.213
-Do that thing.
-Hold on.

41:57.215 --> 41:58.781
-I don't know.
-[laughs]

41:58.783 --> 42:00.250
I'm afraid
of those teeth, man.

42:00.318 --> 42:01.551
It's a nice fish.

42:02.687 --> 42:04.320
Oh.

42:04.322 --> 42:05.722
No. Come on this way.
This way.

42:05.724 --> 42:06.756
Got it.

42:08.827 --> 42:11.261
Right in the side.
Right inside. Perfect.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.062
Right inside here
so they can pop her off.

42:13.131 --> 42:14.531
-Perfect.
-Oh, yeah.

42:14.533 --> 42:16.199
Yeah, good.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.134
Careful. Careful.

42:18.203 --> 42:19.802
Hooked up.

42:19.804 --> 42:21.437
[casey] yeah.

42:21.506 --> 42:23.506
[jeff] this is a big one.

42:23.508 --> 42:25.041
>> on board.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.809
[casey] yeah, boys.

42:26.811 --> 42:27.644
Woo!

42:27.745 --> 42:28.711
Ow, yeah.

42:28.713 --> 42:29.712
[shane] our time.

42:31.249 --> 42:32.215
Nice shot brother.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.516
Yes! Whoa!

42:33.518 --> 42:34.551
Yeah!

42:34.619 --> 42:36.519
What a [bleep] day, brother.

42:38.056 --> 42:39.255
Good day, man.

42:39.324 --> 42:40.323
Good day.

42:41.426 --> 42:43.960
This is awesome.
The old man would love this.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.401
<i> It's good to have you</i>
<i> out on this trip, dude.</i>

42:52.804 --> 42:54.203
[shane] <i> yeah.</i>

42:54.205 --> 42:55.939
But you definitely
made that possible

42:55.941 --> 42:57.206
[indistinct]
those extra hands, man,

42:57.208 --> 42:58.608
That really saved the day.

42:58.610 --> 42:59.742
Thanks, man.

42:59.811 --> 43:01.344
Cheers.

43:01.413 --> 43:03.313
What's going on now?

43:03.315 --> 43:05.515
Oh, man, casey's crunching
the numbers,

43:05.517 --> 43:07.216
<i> We're gonna figure</i>
<i> some stuff out.</i>

43:10.855 --> 43:12.255
[jeff]
how's it going in, case?

43:14.859 --> 43:16.225
We need to catch
a lot more fish.

43:17.429 --> 43:19.729
Every week, we have to deliver
3,000 pounds

43:19.731 --> 43:22.398
Divided up in whatever way
that the chefs want.

43:22.400 --> 43:23.533
<i> There's white fish</i>

43:23.602 --> 43:25.735
Like the standard
ono and mahi-mahi.

43:25.837 --> 43:27.136
But then there's also
even rarer stuff

43:27.205 --> 43:28.705
Like the ulua we cut today.

43:28.707 --> 43:30.540
But the bulk of our order
is ahi,

43:30.642 --> 43:32.809
And that's where we keep
coming up short.

43:32.811 --> 43:34.844
[shane] so, yeah,
I've been doing some thinking.

43:34.913 --> 43:37.347
Come on, don't hurt yourself.

43:37.448 --> 43:38.414
[casey] yo.

43:41.353 --> 43:43.319
We, uh, we got plenty
of variety.

43:43.321 --> 43:46.055
Nowhere near the quantity
we're gonna need.

43:46.057 --> 43:48.324
We just didn't get enough.

43:49.561 --> 43:50.927
Well [bleep]

43:50.929 --> 43:52.228
[casey]
I'm gonna start drinking.

43:53.531 --> 43:55.131
[josh]
<i> two weeks into this contrac</i>

43:55.133 --> 43:57.600
<i> And we haven't delivered</i>
<i> the</i>  [indistinct]

43:57.602 --> 43:59.602
To tell you,
barry and his partners

43:59.604 --> 44:01.337
Are not gonna put up with this
for long.

44:02.641 --> 44:03.806
You guys wanna see
something cool?

44:03.808 --> 44:05.208
-[josh] yeah.
-[shane] yeah.

44:05.210 --> 44:06.643
Here, come check this is out.
Let's go for a ride.

44:06.711 --> 44:09.712
[dramatic music playing]

44:10.815 --> 44:12.115
[jeff] I don't think
you finding

44:12.117 --> 44:14.817
Your dad's matchbook
was an accident.

44:18.323 --> 44:19.756
And this year,
at one point in time

44:19.857 --> 44:21.524
Was the beautiful coco palms.

44:23.228 --> 44:24.360
It's got a lot of history,

44:25.630 --> 44:27.630
You know,
and it's been through a lot.

44:30.135 --> 44:31.200
But...

44:32.303 --> 44:34.337
It's got a solid foundation,
you know?

44:34.439 --> 44:37.040
-A lot like you guys.
-[josh] yeah.

44:37.042 --> 44:39.142
[jeff] there's nothing to time
or anything

44:39.243 --> 44:40.610
Can do to that place
like this,

44:40.612 --> 44:43.112
A relationship like yours,
it's gonna change that.

44:43.114 --> 44:45.448
Me and my dad,

44:45.517 --> 44:47.316
Our relationship has...

44:48.720 --> 44:50.486
Almost been nothing
but struggles.

44:50.488 --> 44:51.821
But nowadays,

44:51.823 --> 44:53.122
My dad's one
of my best friends.

44:53.124 --> 44:55.058
I've been able
to work through it

44:55.060 --> 44:57.660
And I think it's important
that whatever you guys have,

44:57.762 --> 44:58.795
It's never too late
to move forward

44:58.797 --> 45:00.029
And work it out.

45:08.306 --> 45:09.305
Well...

45:10.608 --> 45:12.408
I'm sorry
I didn't jump to this

45:12.410 --> 45:14.811
When you first came to me

45:14.813 --> 45:16.412
Because I mean,
to be honest, man,

45:16.414 --> 45:18.748
I feel like we got screwed
because of the divorce

45:18.850 --> 45:20.750
And the whole family
splitting apart.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.821
So just... I had a...

45:24.823 --> 45:26.122
One of the worst days
of my life

45:26.124 --> 45:29.325
Was when I got a phone call
from phil

45:29.327 --> 45:31.494
Letting me know that
I wasn't gonna be able

45:31.496 --> 45:33.763
To see you or jake anymore.

45:33.832 --> 45:36.065
That was...
That was a crushing day.

45:37.435 --> 45:40.103
I wanted to be there,
I wanted to watch it grow,

45:40.105 --> 45:41.604
And play sports,

45:41.606 --> 45:43.506
First girlfriend,
all that stuff.

45:46.111 --> 45:47.410
We missed out on a lot.

45:50.949 --> 45:52.849
So I just hope you know
how much I, uh,

45:54.018 --> 45:55.418
How much you meant to me, man.

45:58.256 --> 46:01.224
Yeah, I never felt abandoned.
I knew...

46:02.660 --> 46:04.961
The situations
were out of our control.

46:04.963 --> 46:06.829
Was there anything
that we did?

46:06.831 --> 46:08.030
-Yeah.
-You know?

46:08.032 --> 46:09.799
And decisions got made
that were out

46:09.801 --> 46:13.536
Of our [bleep] reach
and here we are now though.

46:16.407 --> 46:18.441
So now what do we do?

46:18.543 --> 46:21.144
You know [indistinct]
move some stuff around

46:21.212 --> 46:22.311
And give you a hand, man.

46:22.313 --> 46:23.646
Let's get this done, huh?

46:26.518 --> 46:27.950
What about your business
back home?

46:28.987 --> 46:30.353
I'm gonna work
some things out,

46:30.421 --> 46:31.821
Make it happen.

46:31.823 --> 46:33.055
That would be awesome.

46:33.091 --> 46:34.423
We can figure this out
together

46:34.425 --> 46:35.858
For as long
as you wanna stay, bro.

46:35.927 --> 46:37.059
[shane] all right.

46:38.830 --> 46:40.763
[josh]
<i> I know my dad loved shane.</i>

46:40.832 --> 46:41.931
<i> But I never knew</i>
<i> he was the one</i>

46:41.933 --> 46:43.432
<i> That sent him away.</i>

46:43.501 --> 46:45.501
And I'm sure it ate him up
inside to do it.

46:45.503 --> 46:47.436
I'm realizing now
that part of carrying on

46:47.505 --> 46:49.038
<i> The family legacy...</i>

46:49.107 --> 46:50.940
Is finding ways
to make the family stronger.

46:52.310 --> 46:53.843
<i> Maybe we'll catch the fish</i>
<i> we need every week</i>

46:53.912 --> 46:56.312
<i> Or, you know what,</i>
<i> maybe we won't.</i>

46:56.314 --> 46:57.947
<i> But I have my big brother</i>
<i> back in the picture</i>

46:57.949 --> 46:59.048
After a decade.

46:59.117 --> 47:00.750
Feels like a win already.

47:03.655 --> 47:04.620
Hey.

47:05.523 --> 47:07.123
Where do I look?

47:07.125 --> 47:08.958
Right down that lens
right there.

47:09.027 --> 47:11.127
-That lens right there?
-Yeah, that little guy.

47:11.129 --> 47:12.862
All right. Well, I'm shane,

47:12.964 --> 47:14.463
-Josh's older brother.
-[laughs]

47:14.565 --> 47:16.699
And, uh, let's do it.

47:16.701 --> 47:19.635
Yeah, you have no clue
what's about to happen.

47:23.308 --> 47:24.740
[narrator] <i> coming up.</i>

47:24.842 --> 47:26.609
<i> On an all-new season</i>
<i> on bloodline.</i>

47:26.611 --> 47:27.810
-[shane] whoa!
-[casey] yeah, boy.

47:27.812 --> 47:28.744
Yeah, baby!

47:28.846 --> 47:29.812

47:29.814 --> 47:31.447
-Whoa! Watch out!
-[josh] oh.

47:31.549 --> 47:33.015
<i> My dad's notebooks</i>
<i> were a lot of names</i>

47:33.017 --> 47:34.083
And a lot of places.

47:34.085 --> 47:35.218
You know I need to do this.

47:35.220 --> 47:36.953
So you wanna leave hawaii
right now?

47:37.021 --> 47:38.120
You're gonna leave
our business?

47:38.122 --> 47:41.123
This [indistinct]
these are fishing spots.

47:41.125 --> 47:42.225
We got tuna.

47:42.227 --> 47:43.326
[man] yeah.

47:43.328 --> 47:44.560
Kind of a life right here.

47:45.730 --> 47:47.129
All right.

47:47.131 --> 47:48.931
You're the man that built
the cornelia marie, are you?

47:48.933 --> 47:50.666
Oh, yes, sir [indistinct]

47:50.668 --> 47:53.002
Yeah, the hurricane came
straight through this area.

47:53.004 --> 47:54.604
And there's just
complete devastation

47:54.606 --> 47:55.805
Everywhere you look.

47:55.807 --> 47:57.006
[josh]
<i> there has to be another way</i>

47:57.008 --> 47:58.507
You're kidding me.

47:58.509 --> 48:00.910
I found someone
that knew the old man.

48:00.912 --> 48:02.044
No [bleep] way.

48:02.113 --> 48:05.114
[dramatic music playing]
