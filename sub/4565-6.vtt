WEBVTT

00:09.809 --> 00:12.578
Look what's happening,
look what's coming.

00:12.580 --> 00:13.912
What's coming, crazy?

00:13.914 --> 00:15.347
Invitations...

00:15.349 --> 00:17.916
To the seventh grade
parties.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.785
It's begun.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.620
We could be
party girls.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.522
I'm going to need
a party-girl walk.

00:32.832 --> 00:33.899
Yeah, that's not it.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.469
You know, there is
going to be boys

00:37.471 --> 00:39.738
At these parties.
But not just any boys.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.941
No, opposite-sex boys.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.843
They're the best kind.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.879
- Yeah, you sound
ready for this.
- Oh, I am.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.514
And I may just be
the first girl

00:48.516 --> 00:51.283
Who crosses over
from our side of the room
to the...

00:51.285 --> 00:53.352
- Yeah, it's gonna be me.
- Yeah, it's gonna be you.

00:54.854 --> 00:57.756
You know what pretty-boy
hipster is handing out
invitations to...

00:57.758 --> 00:59.892
- Don't you?
- A party.

00:59.894 --> 01:02.494
Membership cards
to the popular club.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.696
Why can't you just
let it be a party?

01:04.698 --> 01:06.865
Because this is it,
right here.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.835
This is where you go one way
and I go the other way.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.438
You get the invite and you
marry pretty-boy hipster

01:12.440 --> 01:14.973
And I end up marrying
anthony delveccio

01:14.975 --> 01:16.942
And we buy things in bulk.

01:20.013 --> 01:23.348
You're gonna
be popular.  I'm not.

01:24.284 --> 01:26.452
Good for you.

01:29.956 --> 01:31.623
Good girl.

01:33.293 --> 01:34.927
Bye-bye, maya.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.695
( sobbing )
bye-bye.

01:52.812 --> 01:54.880
( humming )

01:55.815 --> 01:56.882
Yay!

01:56.884 --> 01:57.983
For me.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.121
Maya, I know you
didn't get one,

02:02.123 --> 02:04.323
But is it okay
if I'm really happy?

02:04.325 --> 02:06.024
You go get 'em, tiger.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.293
( laughs )

02:09.929 --> 02:12.898
I love you, but...
You a lot of work.

You got invited

03:14.895 --> 03:18.997
So much for genetics, baby.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.066
Ooh, seventh grade party.

03:21.068 --> 03:24.703
Yup, I didn't get invited
to a whole lot of these.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.840
Good for you.
I'm proud of you.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.676
- Boy-girl party?
- Yup.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.144
- You can't go.
- You can't go.

03:34.581 --> 03:35.681
May I approach?

03:35.683 --> 03:37.149
- Hurry, please.
- Hurry, please.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.919
I'm gonna keep
your young'un
out of trouble, sir.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.654
Hart, you are trouble.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.756
Why would I want
my young'un anywhere near

03:44.758 --> 03:46.124
The same party
you're gonna be at?

03:46.126 --> 03:47.392
You wouldn't.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.061
Say it.
You know you wanna say it.

03:49.063 --> 03:52.898
You can't go
if maya's invited.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.533
Maya's not invited.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.101
- Then you may go.
- Thanks, daddy.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.770
All right,
good day, everybody.
Class dismissed.

03:58.772 --> 03:59.905
Cory:
<i>Sit down!</i>

03:59.907 --> 04:01.006
( unison )
sit down.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.577
So there's this guy
damocles

04:05.579 --> 04:07.713
Who really really
wants to be king.

04:07.715 --> 04:11.917
One day he gets an invitation
to come sit on the throne

04:11.919 --> 04:14.419
And actually hang
with royalty.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.521
- No!
- 'sup, riles?

04:16.523 --> 04:18.023
Pop's lesson hitting
a little close to home?

04:18.025 --> 04:21.426
Nope, what he's saying
has nothing to do with me.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.496
Yes, I've been invited to hang
with middle-school royalty,

04:24.498 --> 04:26.465
But nothing bad could happen.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.767
I'm sure you're right.
Farkle!

04:28.769 --> 04:30.035
When damocles sat
on the throne

04:30.037 --> 04:31.837
He noticed a sword
hanging over it,

04:31.839 --> 04:33.071
Help up by a single
tiny thread.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.207
- Maya.
- Be careful what you wish for.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.009
Why?

04:37.011 --> 04:38.844
Being what other people
want you to be is

04:38.846 --> 04:41.046
Just a sword
hanging over your head.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.881
Good.
Riley.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.583
Nothing to do with me.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.992
Come on, mommy.
I want my muffin
and my joke.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.662
Oh, honey, it looks like
mrs. Svorski is busy
right now.

04:56.664 --> 05:00.799
So how about
we just find you
a new favorite place?

05:00.801 --> 05:03.769
I like this place.
I like mrs. Svorski.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.071
Auggie!

05:10.176 --> 05:11.843
Muffin!

05:11.845 --> 05:15.113
It's not muffin.
It's bulochki.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.816
I baked just for you,
little man.

05:19.619 --> 05:21.987
Ah, topanga.
Sit, darling.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.922
Mrs. Svorski,
it's very nice to see you.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.692
I'm afraid that we
won't be able to stay.

05:26.694 --> 05:27.859
But I love her.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.195
Pinch my cheeks,
do it.

05:30.197 --> 05:34.032
40 years here,
now they try
to push me out.

05:34.034 --> 05:37.703
- I know that.
- Yeah, you can't put price
on good neighborhood place

05:37.705 --> 05:41.039
Where people come
and they sit and they talk.

05:41.041 --> 05:44.576
- Mrs. Svorski...
- Yeah, okay.

05:45.978 --> 05:49.247
Big-deal-frozen-yogurt people
want place.

05:49.249 --> 05:52.551
Contract say
"no raise rent."

05:52.553 --> 05:55.987
Yogurt lawyer
say "loophole."

05:55.989 --> 05:59.958
Yogurt lawyer's
scum of earth.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.361
Mommy's a lawyer.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.863
I know.

06:06.065 --> 06:08.200
Three weeks I not see you.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.936
Mrs. Svorski,
I feel terrible about this.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.804
- Oh...
- Tell the joke.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.941
I know not your doing.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.976
Is not ukrainian bakery.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.545
Is my-krainian bakery.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.881
( laughs )
oh man, that's good.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.118
Why aren't you
laughing, mommy?

06:26.120 --> 06:28.954
I work for a very big
law firm.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.989
I don't have a say
in which cases we represent.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.658
Maybe so,
maybe not so.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.962
You tell big-deal lawyers
mrs. Svorski hopes

06:36.964 --> 06:39.598
They fall
in their own loophole.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.602
Don't you worry.
My mommy will take care
of everything.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.736
Right, mommy?

06:59.018 --> 07:01.019
Well, looky here,
teacher daddy,

07:01.021 --> 07:02.821
Nothing hanging
over my head

07:02.823 --> 07:06.892
Except this here halo
of popularity.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.326
And yay for you,
my best friend,

07:08.328 --> 07:10.228
For watching me
with a smile.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.864
Yeah, I'm smiling,
I'm watching.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.677
All right, all right.
Half hour you can stay.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.813
I'm waiting right here.

07:29.215 --> 07:30.315
( doorbell buzzes )

07:30.317 --> 07:32.317
( exhales )

07:32.319 --> 07:34.286
I changed my mind.
I want you in there.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.720
Protect your friend.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.322
I can't do that, sir.
Wasn't invited.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.890
Why is that exactly?

07:38.892 --> 07:40.659
About to find out, sir.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.961
Smile.
Watch.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.197
Greetings,
fellow partygoer.

07:45.199 --> 07:47.899
Farkle?

07:47.901 --> 07:49.901
Starting to become
clear, sir?

07:49.903 --> 07:52.671
Oh yeah.
I'm smiling real big.

07:53.873 --> 07:55.941
Announcing the arrival
of party guest number six,

07:55.943 --> 07:57.008
Female number one.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.712
I'm a female, farkle.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.417
You getting this yet?

08:05.419 --> 08:07.986
But pretty boy--
pretty boy's still here.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.155
Wait for it.

08:15.795 --> 08:19.030
That's the greatest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.099
It's a geek party.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.234
I know, honey.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.936
Everybody welcome riley.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.005
( speaking in foreign language )

08:28.341 --> 08:31.676
Honey, stay an hour.
Stay a week, stay forever.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.944
Just enjoy.

08:34.046 --> 08:36.915
Hey, you know what would
make this just perfect for me?

08:36.917 --> 08:38.984
Have you noticed
the lightsabers hanging
from the ceiling

08:38.986 --> 08:41.119
Precariously over
your head?

08:41.121 --> 08:43.054
( lightsaber whirring )

08:44.190 --> 08:46.358
Damocles.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.159
( snickering )

08:48.161 --> 08:49.227
- There it is.
- I know.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.332
Farkle, how could you
do this to me?

08:54.334 --> 08:59.004
With all my friends
because I always thought
you were one of us?

08:59.006 --> 09:01.506
You think I'm one of you.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.951
( moaning )

09:12.953 --> 09:15.921
Broccoli,
she's intelligent.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.425
We come in peace.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.928
Actually you guys
came in two pieces.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.996
( mechanical laugh )

09:24.998 --> 09:26.765
She makes us laugh.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.966
Thank you.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.936
She should be our queen.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.938
They love you, riley.
I've never seen such

09:32.940 --> 09:34.906
Immediate and overwhelming
popularity.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.008
I'm popular?

09:40.913 --> 09:42.914
<i>♪ I'm singing "go-o-o"</i>

09:42.916 --> 09:45.383
<i>♪ oh-oh-oh-oh.</i>

09:47.453 --> 09:49.187
Okay, farkle.
Where is she?

09:49.189 --> 09:53.058
Whatever have I done to deserve
this display of affection?

09:53.060 --> 09:56.094
This look like
affection to you?

09:56.096 --> 09:59.531
I takes it
however I gets it.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.900
( smacks lips )
right there, nurse.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.438
She wasn't there when I tried
to pick her up this morning

10:06.440 --> 10:08.473
And I couldn't
find her in the halls.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.108
What'd you do
with my girl?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.811
Riley:
<i>Maya, release the farkle.</i>

10:19.018 --> 10:21.052
Farkle didn't do anything
except open my eyes

10:21.054 --> 10:23.355
To what the world
really thinks I am.

10:23.357 --> 10:26.024
A harajuku girl?

10:26.026 --> 10:30.061
Yes, because I figure
if what I am is nerdy-geeky,

10:30.063 --> 10:33.565
I'm going to set
the nerdy-geeky world on fire.

10:36.168 --> 10:37.235
You take it.

10:38.170 --> 10:40.939
Nope, beyond me.
All yours.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.073
( sighs )

10:42.075 --> 10:43.908
Why should I struggle
to be popular

10:43.910 --> 10:46.578
When I can be these people's
empress fairy queen?

10:46.580 --> 10:48.179
( honking sound )

10:52.318 --> 10:54.552
No, please.
The one guy was two guys.

10:54.554 --> 10:57.022
The sword fell.
This is the way
you're gonna go?

10:57.024 --> 10:58.256
You're gonna embrace this?

10:58.258 --> 11:01.593
Deal with it.
I've gone over to the dork side.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.162
This isn't you.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.097
- This is her.
- They love this me.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.265
I'm not changing you back.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.867
Oh, yes you are.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.935
My daughter's going through
this week's crazy...

11:10.937 --> 11:12.103
You get in there.

11:13.973 --> 11:15.874
Father, may we continue
with the lesson?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.242
I seek knowledge.

11:19.278 --> 11:21.112
Never mind,
leave her alone.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.480
Look at her.

11:27.319 --> 11:30.021
All right, what do you guys
know about girls?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.924
Mostly we're terrified
of them, sir.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.293
So we try to keep
our distance.

11:35.295 --> 11:39.097
Well, then I choose
empress fairy nut job.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.467

11:53.647 --> 11:58.049
Another day,
another little piece
of my soul gone.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.655
It's not gone.
It's still right here.

12:03.657 --> 12:06.124
About time you showed up.

12:06.126 --> 12:10.161
You still filled with all that
hope and promise for the world?

12:10.163 --> 12:13.331
Yeah, aren't you?

12:13.333 --> 12:16.167
Well, I've been living in it.

12:16.169 --> 12:19.137
Hey, you wanted
success.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.072
I stepped
out of the way.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.008
<i>Congratulations,</i>
<i>new york lawyer.</i>

12:24.010 --> 12:26.211
Go do what you know
how to do.

12:26.213 --> 12:29.948
The people I work for
are on the wrong side
of this case.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.015
What do I do?

12:31.017 --> 12:33.017
Are you asking
my help?

12:34.487 --> 12:36.554
I thought
you'd never ask.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.461
Hi.

12:46.398 --> 12:48.066
Give me your hand.

12:50.570 --> 12:54.472
I want to see
if our energies converge.

12:57.643 --> 12:59.043
Hi.

13:00.112 --> 13:03.148
Mrs. Svorski,
while I am charmed

13:03.150 --> 13:08.019
By your old-world bakery
and thoroughly enjoyed the...

13:08.021 --> 13:09.587
Muffin...

13:09.589 --> 13:13.091
Is not muffin,
big-deal yogurt lawyer.

13:13.093 --> 13:16.027
- It's bulochki.
- It's bulochki.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.262
- Topanga?
- Topanga?

13:17.264 --> 13:20.064
Yeah, this is me.

13:20.066 --> 13:23.001
( whispers )
she talks to her mirror.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.236
You're not on this case.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.672
Oh, yeah?
Why's that?

13:27.674 --> 13:32.410
Because you like people
and that gets in my way.

13:32.412 --> 13:35.680
I'm not talking about you,
mrs. Svorski, you're a peach.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.615
When you go bald?

13:37.617 --> 13:39.050
Right now.

13:42.255 --> 13:45.156
Why are you doing that?
What are you doing?

13:46.592 --> 13:48.593
She's going
to her happy place.

13:48.595 --> 13:51.129
What we do in meantime?

13:51.131 --> 13:53.331
I know!

13:53.333 --> 13:56.134
I sing song
from old country.

13:58.103 --> 14:01.739
♪ 100 people in line
for the bread ♪

14:01.741 --> 14:04.008
♪ 100 people in line

14:04.010 --> 14:06.144
♪ one gets a loaf,
takes it home ♪

14:06.146 --> 14:08.713
♪ that's all the bread
we have for entire year. ♪

14:13.152 --> 14:15.086
Oh, that's a good song.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.060
I think it's important
to have a neighborhood place

14:22.062 --> 14:24.629
That reflects
an actual culture.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.065
Where people sit
and they talk.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.099
They talk.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.234
And there's a nice lady

14:29.236 --> 14:30.668
Who pinches your cheeks.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.170
- Oh, I--
- don't.

14:33.239 --> 14:37.609
See, in my happy place,
I'm hearing she pays triple rent

14:37.611 --> 14:40.478
Or she's out
on her bulochki.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.347
And hey, aquarius,
be a good hippie

14:42.349 --> 14:45.083
And see if you can
channel my shark lawyer back.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.051
Ask her if she's still
working for us.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.186
You're mean.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.654
Oh, thanks, kid.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.360
Come on.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.561
This is not
who you are.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.696
What do you know
about being a harajuku girl?

14:58.698 --> 15:01.733
I don't have to know anything
except that they love it.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.269
Sorry, maya, I walk
with a different crowd now.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.639
And as you can see,
I am quite the influence
on them.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.517
Maya?

15:19.519 --> 15:21.653
She's...

15:21.655 --> 15:23.354
Gone, sir.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.791
Yes, she is.

15:33.132 --> 15:35.366
Okay, I'm gonna take
one last shot at this

15:35.368 --> 15:37.402
While I believe riley
is still in there

15:37.404 --> 15:39.804
And not completely
under the spell of--

15:44.877 --> 15:46.444
Ladies.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.879
Farkle!

15:49.181 --> 15:50.815
She's on of us now, maya.

15:50.817 --> 15:54.285
She's one of me, farkle.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.888
You're not letting her
reach her full potential.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.559
The world I know
wants you to be yourself.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.961
In my world--

16:02.963 --> 16:05.196
It needs you in it.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.631
You're on of us now.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.899
And I've decided to prove it

16:07.901 --> 16:09.767
By letting you help
the john quincy adams'

16:09.769 --> 16:11.402
Spelling-bee team
to the regional finals.

16:11.404 --> 16:14.505
I'm right about you, riley.
I know I am.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.875
Sorry, maya.
The world wants
what the world wants.

16:17.877 --> 16:21.179
And right now the world
wants me like this.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.647
This isn't over, farkle.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.815
I'm not scared.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.516
Oh, really?

16:25.518 --> 16:26.884
<i>( loud thud )</i>

16:28.554 --> 16:29.854
<i>( loud thud )</i>

16:29.856 --> 16:31.823
Guys, what about me?

16:31.825 --> 16:32.824
Yay!

16:32.826 --> 16:34.225
<i>( loud thud )</i>

16:39.798 --> 16:41.599
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

16:49.208 --> 16:50.408
Daddy?

16:50.410 --> 16:51.542
Yup?

16:51.544 --> 16:54.512
We're the normal ones, right?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.347
I hope so, bubba.

16:57.683 --> 16:58.683
What is this?

16:58.685 --> 17:00.218
What is that?

17:00.220 --> 17:01.886
This is who I am inside.

17:01.888 --> 17:05.289
It's the part of me
your father fell in love with
a long time ago.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.293
This is what's
inside of you?

17:09.295 --> 17:11.929
Yeah, might be
the best part.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.565
Is this the best part
of you?

17:14.567 --> 17:18.736
I'm extremely popular
with five people.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.606
Is one of them you?

17:25.377 --> 17:27.678
Weird mommy's cool.

17:29.348 --> 17:30.948
Way cool.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.887
You've made
the right decision

17:35.889 --> 17:38.990
Letting the bakery go,
mrs. Svorski.

17:38.992 --> 17:40.758
What's the point
of serving people

17:40.760 --> 17:42.393
In a self-serving world?

17:42.395 --> 17:44.796
Don't sign anything.

17:44.798 --> 17:46.898
You work for me.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.500
Oh, yeah?
Then you're gonna hate this.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.303
I'd like to call
my first witness.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.905
Nobody's on trial here.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.007
Actually, a voice
I've always trusted

17:56.009 --> 17:57.875
Has been telling me
that I am.

17:57.877 --> 18:01.779
Well, could you tell that voice
that you're in a bakery?

18:04.383 --> 18:07.318
Mrs. Svorski...

18:07.320 --> 18:10.955
I know that you can't
afford the new rent by yourself.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.957
But I wonder if you would
share your business

18:12.959 --> 18:15.626
With some people that will care
about it as much as you do?

18:15.628 --> 18:16.994
That's us.

18:18.730 --> 18:22.400
Topanga succeeds at anything
she puts her mind to.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.969
And I'm here with our checkbook.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.638
What do you do
for living?

18:27.640 --> 18:29.740
I'm a middle-school teacher.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.375
( laughs )
oh boy.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.979
He's always been
my partner

18:34.981 --> 18:37.281
And we've always
done well together.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.517
But now it's time
to do good.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.419
Topanga...

18:41.421 --> 18:44.622
You would help me
keep my place?

18:44.624 --> 18:47.024
There's a part of me
that knows what's right.

18:47.026 --> 18:50.461
It's right that this place
stays right here.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.498
You sure
you killer-shark lawyer?

18:56.368 --> 18:58.836
I need
an advance on my salary
in the exact amount

18:58.838 --> 19:00.838
It costs to keep
this place going.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.609
Or I will go
to the competition
and I will destroy you.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.578
Yeah, she shark.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.748
What?
Where am I gonna find
somebody else like you?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.483
You won't.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.920
You're still mean.

19:16.955 --> 19:18.656
Don't try
to cheer me up, kid.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.335
Welcome,
to this qualifying round

19:31.337 --> 19:33.971
Of the city regional
spelling bee

19:33.973 --> 19:36.841
Between our own
john quincy adams
middle school...

19:36.843 --> 19:38.943
( applause )

19:38.945 --> 19:40.444
...And einstein academy.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.780
( applause )

19:42.782 --> 19:46.984
Formidable opponents...
And smackle.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.954
I am energy, you can't
destroy energy.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.022
Ha!

19:51.957 --> 19:53.824
( mouthing )

19:55.427 --> 19:57.929
Riley, get up there
and show us who you
really are.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.469
Okay, miss matthews.

20:07.005 --> 20:09.006
Your first word is--

20:09.008 --> 20:11.642
- Maya, you can't--
- check out the word,
mr. Matthews.

20:11.644 --> 20:15.880
Hey, farkle's
not the only one
with a master plan.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.949
Miss matthews,

20:17.951 --> 20:21.018
Your word is harajuku.

20:23.922 --> 20:24.922
Excuse me?

20:24.924 --> 20:26.857
Harajuku.

20:26.859 --> 20:30.428
Uh, may I have the meaning
of the word?

20:30.430 --> 20:31.929
Oh, you don't know?

20:32.864 --> 20:34.599
Then let me tell you.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.601
It's a real neighborhood
in japan,

20:36.603 --> 20:39.136
Where authentic japanese girls

20:39.138 --> 20:43.007
Have created an authentic look
and life for themselves

20:43.009 --> 20:44.642
That is unique to them.

20:45.711 --> 20:47.545
Country of origin?

20:49.881 --> 20:52.583
Are you kidding me?

20:52.585 --> 20:54.785
Can I hear it in a sentence?

20:56.088 --> 20:57.588
Yeah.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.957
"stop pretending
to be a harajuku girl,

20:59.959 --> 21:01.859
Because you're not;

21:01.861 --> 21:03.494
You're riley."

21:03.496 --> 21:05.029
R-I-l-e-y.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.966
Five seconds,
miss matthews,

21:08.968 --> 21:12.637
What do you mean
"eliminated"?

21:12.639 --> 21:15.773
It means you wouldn't be
part of the group anymore.

21:18.877 --> 21:20.978
Harajuku,

21:20.980 --> 21:25.016
Something I'm n-o-t.

21:25.018 --> 21:26.951
Sorry, farkle.
It was a lovely party

21:26.953 --> 21:28.853
And your friends
are really pretty cool.

21:28.855 --> 21:32.523
( chuckles )
we've never been
called that before.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.992
Thanks, riley.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.661
We feel the same way
about you.

21:39.064 --> 21:40.131
( bell dings )

21:44.903 --> 21:46.971
Well, I guess
we're back to where

21:46.973 --> 21:49.907
Popular is gonna be
kind of hard, huh?

21:49.909 --> 21:51.676
I wouldn't know.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.944
And let's not try so hard
to find out.

22:01.019 --> 22:02.086
You miss her?

22:02.088 --> 22:03.788
Who?

22:03.790 --> 22:04.922
The other topanga.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.058
No.

22:07.060 --> 22:08.959
I've always known
where she is.

22:10.762 --> 22:12.029
You know what
the best thing is

22:12.031 --> 22:13.998
- About being yourself?
- What?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.033
You're always popular
with your best friend.

22:17.903 --> 22:20.037
Ready for new joke?

22:20.039 --> 22:22.573
Is not ukrainian bakery...

22:22.575 --> 22:25.009
Is our-krainian bakery.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.878
( laughing )
oh man, that's good.

22:29.648 --> 22:30.915
I don't get it.
