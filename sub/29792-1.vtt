00:13.615 --> 00:17.282
(dramatic electronic music)

01:38.277 --> 01:39.977
- [Woman] Do I know you?

01:39.977 --> 01:41.267
- No, but I know you.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.683
I'm a big fan of your work.

01:43.550 --> 01:44.383
- Are you now?

01:45.260 --> 01:46.093
- [Man] Yes.

01:46.093 --> 01:48.861
I've been following you
for quite some time.

01:48.861 --> 01:51.855
- And what is it that you think that I do?

01:51.855 --> 01:54.350
- I know you only go out at night,

01:54.350 --> 01:56.950
you wonder why you never
venture out during the day.

01:58.070 --> 02:00.007
- State your business or be gone with you.

02:00.007 --> 02:01.870
- I'm a detective.

02:01.870 --> 02:05.040
I've got a case about the
disappearance of small children.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.901
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

02:07.901 --> 02:09.193
- I can't say that I do.

02:11.068 --> 02:13.170
I've been out partying all night.

02:13.170 --> 02:14.470
I'd like to go inside now.

02:15.493 --> 02:17.043
- [Man] You mind if I join you?

02:19.190 --> 02:20.370
- Sure.

02:20.370 --> 02:22.168
We'll have a drink together.

02:22.168 --> 02:23.400
- [Man] That sounds swell.

02:23.400 --> 02:27.233
(suspicious electronic music)

02:43.554 --> 02:45.055
It's really dark in here.

02:45.055 --> 02:46.638
- [Woman] Allow me.

02:49.658 --> 02:52.158
(woman yells)

03:08.830 --> 03:11.645
- Let me introduce myself.

03:11.645 --> 03:13.157
I'm Van Helsing.

03:13.157 --> 03:14.490
You heard of me?

03:18.372 --> 03:20.646
I'll make it stop.

03:20.646 --> 03:22.253
You're the last of your kind.

03:22.253 --> 03:25.503
After you, they'll be no more vampires.

03:31.734 --> 03:33.470
- [Woman] She's coming.

03:33.470 --> 03:34.720
- Who's coming?

03:36.692 --> 03:38.359
- [Woman] The queen.

03:39.208 --> 03:40.945
- Is she now?

03:40.945 --> 03:42.528
When is she coming?

03:44.140 --> 03:46.973
- [Woman] You're now going to die.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.479
- I'll tell you what,

03:50.479 --> 03:51.910
I'm not gonna be around
when the end comes,

03:51.910 --> 03:53.110
I'll tell you that much.

03:54.220 --> 03:56.063
I dipped my hands in holy water.

03:57.815 --> 04:00.315
(woman yells)

04:17.094 --> 04:20.177
(upbeat piano music)

04:55.618 --> 04:58.210
- [Woman] For I know the
plans that I have for you,

04:58.210 --> 04:59.250
says the Lord.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.490
Thoughts of peace and not of evil,

05:01.490 --> 05:04.070
to give you a future and a hope.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.383
Jeremiah 29:11.

05:09.887 --> 05:13.054
(upbeat guitar music)

06:29.796 --> 06:30.946
- [Daughter] Who wants to say grace?

06:30.946 --> 06:31.779
- Not me.

06:31.779 --> 06:32.780
Not now, not ever.

06:32.780 --> 06:35.290
I done said enough grace in this house.

06:35.290 --> 06:37.590
- What is that supposed to mean?

06:37.590 --> 06:39.390
Momma will want us to say grace.

06:39.390 --> 06:41.810
- Momma also probably wanted
to live a little longer.

06:41.810 --> 06:43.360
We said our prayers every
morning, noon, and night

06:43.360 --> 06:45.954
to make that happen, but now she gone.

06:45.954 --> 06:47.186
- That's out of our control.

06:47.186 --> 06:48.019
- Yes, you're right.

06:48.019 --> 06:49.930
It's not out of His.

06:49.930 --> 06:51.720
You know me.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.010
I have to have substantial proof

06:53.010 --> 06:54.466
before I believe in something.

06:54.466 --> 06:56.333
Forgive me if I'm having my doubts.

06:57.838 --> 06:59.880
- What do you call the Bible?

06:59.880 --> 07:03.210
- It's a telephone book
of fortune cookie phrases.

07:03.210 --> 07:04.860
Life got you feeling hectic?

07:04.860 --> 07:07.210
Turn to Psalms and find your peace.

07:07.210 --> 07:08.780
- Don't talk like that, dad.

07:08.780 --> 07:09.613
- [Dad] What?

07:09.613 --> 07:10.446
You're the one that's always yelling

07:10.446 --> 07:11.483
about freedom of speech.

07:12.442 --> 07:13.570
- I believe in the freedom of speech

07:13.570 --> 07:15.840
if you're passionate about something.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.370
The thing is, you're not.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.860
You're just hurting because mom is gone

07:18.860 --> 07:20.700
and that's understandable.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.160
I feel broken too.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.830
- So do I, but mom would
want us to be happy.

07:25.830 --> 07:28.150
- [Daughter] And say our prayers.

07:28.150 --> 07:31.080
- Well then, y'all go ahead.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.930
Y'all are real passionate about that.

07:33.945 --> 07:36.862
(slow piano music)

08:20.450 --> 08:24.903
- [Narrator] Greetings from
your friend in Transylvania, D.

08:34.442 --> 08:36.692
(knocking)

08:41.070 --> 08:41.919
- [Daughter] Yes?

08:44.220 --> 08:45.110
- My name is Jack.

08:45.110 --> 08:47.124
I'm here to see Mina.

08:47.124 --> 08:47.957
- Really?

08:47.957 --> 08:49.870
Are you sure not just
pretending you're interested

08:49.870 --> 08:51.353
because you heard about the dowry?

08:52.810 --> 08:54.600
- I don't know what you're talking about.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.260
I merely heard that Mina was one of the

08:56.260 --> 08:59.490
fairest girls in all
the land, as they say.

08:59.490 --> 09:00.727
I wanted to meet her.

09:01.860 --> 09:02.693
Who are you?

09:02.693 --> 09:06.410
- I'm the gatekeeper and you're
not gonna pass me that easy.

09:06.410 --> 09:08.710
How'd you meet my little sister?

09:08.710 --> 09:09.700
- Friend of a friend.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.170
- Which friend?

09:11.170 --> 09:13.240
- You said something about a dowry.

09:14.105 --> 09:16.170
- You know what I'm talking about.

09:16.170 --> 09:17.003
Cut the shit.

09:17.003 --> 09:19.040
If either one of us
girls gets married off,

09:19.040 --> 09:20.979
our mother left us both a prized dowry

09:20.979 --> 09:24.000
to make sure we were taken care of.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
- Are you available?

09:25.890 --> 09:27.653
- Maybe I'm not interested in you.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.840
- Not interested in me?

09:31.840 --> 09:34.083
- I'm not interested in men in general.

09:36.180 --> 09:39.160
- These are progressive
times, aren't they?

09:39.160 --> 09:40.540
She's a very lucky woman.

09:40.540 --> 09:42.310
- Not that way 'cause I'll
be sure a gold digger,

09:42.310 --> 09:44.050
but can you please get off my porch?

09:44.050 --> 09:45.560
I'm expecting a package.

09:45.560 --> 09:46.710
- [Mina] Who is it?

09:46.710 --> 09:47.543
- It's no one.

09:47.543 --> 09:48.733
He was just leaving.

09:51.550 --> 09:52.563
- What's his name?

09:53.827 --> 09:56.290
- Just leaving, that's what your name is.

09:56.290 --> 09:57.633
Run along now.

10:03.306 --> 10:05.950
- Why'd you have to run him off like that?

10:05.950 --> 10:07.300
He was here to see me, wasn't he?

10:07.300 --> 10:08.650
- He doesn't care about you, Mina.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.110
All he's after is some money.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.130
- How do you know?

10:11.130 --> 10:12.990
- I can tell, all right?

10:12.990 --> 10:15.540
There's a reason I'm not
going out with boys anymore.

10:15.540 --> 10:16.840
Too much drama.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.620
- Maybe I wanna experience that,

10:18.620 --> 10:19.453
maybe I wanna go out in the world

10:19.453 --> 10:21.063
and have my share of the pain.

10:22.110 --> 10:24.960
- Do you really wanna
get your heart broken,

10:24.960 --> 10:27.670
to get robbed of your inheritance?

10:27.670 --> 10:29.470
Why did mom have to make it a dowry?

10:30.480 --> 10:32.551
- She didn't want us to be alone.

10:32.551 --> 10:34.033
- You can't buy love.

10:52.320 --> 10:53.620
Where are you off to, dad?

10:54.500 --> 10:56.887
- Kind of fell off on something.

10:56.887 --> 10:58.087
We have to do the story.

11:01.220 --> 11:03.210
- Thought you were gonna take me to work.

11:03.210 --> 11:05.533
- I'll take you to work, Mina.

11:05.533 --> 11:07.230
Where you off to, dad?

11:07.230 --> 11:08.290
- Transylvania.

11:08.290 --> 11:09.720
- Sounds spooky.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.230
Do you know somebody who lives there?

11:11.230 --> 11:12.063
- [Dad] Nope.

11:12.063 --> 11:13.135
Got a postcard.

11:13.135 --> 11:14.720
- You're not gonna do a little more

11:14.720 --> 11:16.890
research before you go out?

11:16.890 --> 11:19.828
- Checked it out online,
says it's a ghost town.

11:19.828 --> 11:21.911
- Then why are you going?

11:22.837 --> 11:26.910
- It's a ghost town, who
sent the postcard, and why?

11:26.910 --> 11:29.100
That's a potential story in itself.

11:29.100 --> 11:30.000
I'll try and check in,

11:30.000 --> 11:33.210
but if I don't hear from
you in a couple days,

11:33.210 --> 11:34.750
you know where to find me.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.283
- [Mina] Don't you think
that's a little crazy?

11:38.317 --> 11:39.213
- [Dad] A little.

11:41.560 --> 11:44.433
I just need to get out of
this house for a little while.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.300
- Fair enough.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.363
Enjoy yourself.

11:53.228 --> 11:54.490
You ready for work?

11:54.490 --> 11:56.600
- Yeah, I just gotta grab a few things.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.050
- Get your shit and let's go.

12:02.916 --> 12:06.249
(mysterious rock music)

12:38.718 --> 12:40.189
- Can I help you find something, sir?

12:40.189 --> 12:41.022
- No.

12:41.022 --> 12:43.690
Actually, I was looking for you.

12:43.690 --> 12:44.523
- For me?

12:44.523 --> 12:45.356
- Yes.

12:45.356 --> 12:46.767
You're Mina, aren't you?

12:46.767 --> 12:47.600
- I am.

12:48.930 --> 12:50.470
Who are you?

12:50.470 --> 12:51.460
- My name is Arthur.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.380
I have traveled several hours and

12:53.380 --> 12:55.314
I was told that I could find you here.

12:55.314 --> 12:57.453
- Who told you this?

12:57.453 --> 12:58.390
- My father.

12:58.390 --> 13:01.370
He's the district manager and so

13:01.370 --> 13:03.860
he has access to all the accounts.

13:03.860 --> 13:06.316
He told me that you'd be here today.

13:06.316 --> 13:07.520
- Why?

13:07.520 --> 13:09.270
- I've got a lot of
formal events coming up,

13:09.270 --> 13:11.890
but unfortunately, I don't have a date.

13:11.890 --> 13:13.970
My father really frowns upon me

13:13.970 --> 13:16.411
if I don't have someone there on my arm.

13:16.411 --> 13:19.040
- What, you want me to
be somebody on your arm?

13:19.040 --> 13:21.530
- Yes, if you'd like to that is.

13:21.530 --> 13:24.190
- I haven't anything fancy
to wear to these events.

13:24.190 --> 13:26.090
- If you need to go shopping,

13:26.090 --> 13:27.626
I can extend you my credit line and

13:27.626 --> 13:29.963
you can go get whatever you need.

13:29.963 --> 13:31.770
- I'm kind of in this phase where I'd

13:31.770 --> 13:33.090
like to wear a lot of black.

13:33.090 --> 13:34.390
Is that gonna be an issue?

13:35.900 --> 13:38.970
- Black is definitely an elegant color,

13:38.970 --> 13:41.877
but I was thinking something
a little bit more formal.

13:41.877 --> 13:43.203
Red maybe?

13:44.570 --> 13:46.510
- Can we talk about this a bit later?

13:46.510 --> 13:48.680
Our supervisor's walking around.

13:48.680 --> 13:51.330
I don't wanna be caught not working.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.440
- My father is the district manager.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.480
- Yeah, but I'm on the clock.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.341
That doesn't make it right for me to

13:58.341 --> 14:00.103
talk while I'm on the clock.

14:02.190 --> 14:04.840
Can I get your number?

14:04.840 --> 14:06.790
I can call you after.

14:06.790 --> 14:07.623
- Sure.

14:07.623 --> 14:08.456
You have your phone on you?

14:08.456 --> 14:09.435
- No.

14:09.435 --> 14:10.700
We're not supposed to
have them on the floor.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.750
- Here, why don't you plug yours in here.

14:16.794 --> 14:19.229
I'm gonna send you a text and just

14:19.229 --> 14:21.479
make sure to give me a
call when you get off.

14:33.310 --> 14:34.143
- [Arthur] Hello.

14:34.143 --> 14:34.976
This is Arthur.

14:34.976 --> 14:35.827
I hope you had a great day at work

14:35.827 --> 14:37.590
and I look forward to
talking to you tonight.

14:37.590 --> 14:38.840
Call me when you get off.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.850
I can't believe that dumb bitch

14:41.850 --> 14:44.010
actually thinks I'm interested in her.

14:44.010 --> 14:46.040
Can you believe she could actually think

14:46.040 --> 14:47.660
that she would be my type?

14:47.660 --> 14:49.570
You can call me a gold
digger all you want,

14:49.570 --> 14:51.720
but all I care about
is that pocket change.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.179
Sorry sweetie.

14:53.179 --> 14:56.179
(man laughs evilly)

15:01.856 --> 15:02.763
- Bad day at work?

15:03.651 --> 15:05.020
(girl cries)

15:05.020 --> 15:06.100
Oh god.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.360
What happened?

15:07.360 --> 15:08.960
Did you get fired or something?

15:08.960 --> 15:09.793
- No.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.728
- Did your favorite celebrity pass away?

15:13.728 --> 15:14.561
- No.

15:17.412 --> 15:19.552
- Were you thinking about mom?

15:19.552 --> 15:21.600
- I'm always thinking about mom.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.550
That's not why I'm crying.

15:23.550 --> 15:25.143
- Then why are you crying?

15:26.760 --> 15:28.963
- Some guy asked me out at work.

15:31.190 --> 15:35.293
I gave him my number and
he's talking crap about me.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.743
- Where's this man so that I may end him?

15:39.626 --> 15:41.700
- Please don't do anything.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.320
His dad's the district manager.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.940
Please don't do anything.

15:44.940 --> 15:46.140
- I don't care if his dad's the

15:46.140 --> 15:47.914
President of the United States.

15:47.914 --> 15:51.910
He doesn't lie to my baby
sister and talk shit about her.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.703
What did the asshat say?

15:54.830 --> 15:59.130
- He called me a dumb bitch.

15:59.130 --> 16:00.093
- That stupid (bleep) tard.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.470
Called you the dumb bitch?

16:02.470 --> 16:05.600
He's gonna be the dumb bitch
when I get done with him.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.723
Right now I'm deciding what to cut off

16:08.723 --> 16:10.290
so that I can shove it up his ass

16:10.290 --> 16:12.210
so every time he sits down,

16:12.210 --> 16:14.400
he'll remember who he can't mess with.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.363
The Harker sisters are
not to be trifled with.

16:18.230 --> 16:19.663
- No, we're not.

16:24.810 --> 16:27.159
Lucy, please don't do anything.

16:27.159 --> 16:29.990
- Why are you defending him?

16:29.990 --> 16:31.963
- I'm defending my job.

16:33.060 --> 16:36.070
I'd lie for you, but
murder's a pretty big lie.

16:36.070 --> 16:38.400
- If you call my little
sister a dumb bitch,

16:38.400 --> 16:41.050
then that's a pretty good
way to get yourself killed.

16:44.380 --> 16:46.561
- I'm glad to see someone that's my bud.

16:46.561 --> 16:47.394
- Always.

16:50.649 --> 16:53.982
(mysterious drum music)

18:23.910 --> 18:25.580
- What are you doing here?

18:25.580 --> 18:27.710
You get lost or something?

18:27.710 --> 18:29.763
- I got a postcard.

18:30.800 --> 18:31.633
- From who?

18:31.633 --> 18:32.730
It wasn't from me.

18:32.730 --> 18:33.920
- [Woman] Or me.

18:33.920 --> 18:34.753
- [Man] Or me.

18:34.753 --> 18:35.928
- [Woman] Not me.

18:35.928 --> 18:38.230
- Who did you get a postcard from?

18:38.230 --> 18:39.253
- All it said is D.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.210
Who is D?

18:44.210 --> 18:45.900
- [Woman] Everybody knows D.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.690
- [Woman] Don't talk
about the master that way.

18:51.985 --> 18:53.235
- Where is she?

18:57.387 --> 18:58.970
- [Woman] This one.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.583
- My name's Kat, with a K.

19:10.910 --> 19:12.480
- What do you do for a living?

19:12.480 --> 19:14.860
- Who said anything about living?

19:14.860 --> 19:17.710
Sometimes you have to die a
little to really be yourself.

19:19.050 --> 19:19.883
- Careful Kat.

19:20.769 --> 19:23.040
You play with fire,
you're gonna get burned.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.640
- I'm just trying to make
him feel more comfortable.

19:26.970 --> 19:29.523
Do you feel welcomed here, Jonathan?

19:34.239 --> 19:36.739
(door creaks)

19:44.570 --> 19:45.403
You're the one.

19:46.943 --> 19:48.943
- What do you mean I'm the one?

19:49.920 --> 19:51.420
- You're the one that D wants.

19:53.178 --> 19:54.978
I don't know if I can resist myself.

19:58.976 --> 20:01.486
(woman gasps)

20:01.486 --> 20:04.403
(mysterious music)

20:19.291 --> 20:21.791
(woman yells)

20:37.539 --> 20:40.456
(mysterious music)

21:27.420 --> 21:29.320
- Jonathan, I've been waiting for you.

21:32.070 --> 21:34.670
Boys, I've made a bit
of a mess in the garage.

21:34.670 --> 21:37.470
Go see if you can put Humpty
Dumpty back together again.

21:41.574 --> 21:43.403
Do you like my dress?

21:45.980 --> 21:47.800
If you don't like it, I'll change.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.093
Too little, or not enough?

21:51.180 --> 21:52.100
(woman hushes)

21:52.100 --> 21:55.873
Don't say anything until
I've shown you the bedroom.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.240
- Who are you?

22:00.240 --> 22:01.520
- [D] You can call me D.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.870
- What does that stand for?

22:03.920 --> 22:05.300
- [D] Dominatrix.

22:05.300 --> 22:08.390
It stands for anything
you want it to, Jonathan.

22:08.390 --> 22:09.840
- [Jonathan] Why did you call me here?

22:09.840 --> 22:11.390
- Because I see an opportunity.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.873
- An opportunity for what?

22:15.660 --> 22:17.680
- [D] If you use my vast experience

22:17.680 --> 22:20.540
combined with your family's assets,

22:20.540 --> 22:22.610
there will be nothing to stand in our way.

22:22.610 --> 22:24.390
- My family's assets?

22:24.390 --> 22:27.341
- I understand that your
wife set aside some money?

22:27.341 --> 22:30.510
- Besides that, you're
only interested in money?

22:30.510 --> 22:31.770
- No, no.

22:31.770 --> 22:33.140
I'm interested in you.

22:33.140 --> 22:34.623
Aren't you interested in me?

22:38.360 --> 22:39.193
- I can't.

22:39.193 --> 22:40.603
I'm still grieving my wife.

22:42.930 --> 22:45.513
(woman hisses)

22:47.090 --> 22:48.543
What did you do with that ring?

22:49.430 --> 22:51.050
- Don't you know?

22:51.050 --> 22:52.600
Your wife is dead.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.660
It's time for you to move on Jonathan.

22:54.660 --> 22:56.223
Don't you wanna have some fun?

22:58.130 --> 22:59.028
- I can't.

22:59.028 --> 23:00.760
She wouldn't do that to me.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.630
- Oh yes she would.

23:02.630 --> 23:05.220
A woman's fire is hard to
quench beyond the grave.

23:05.220 --> 23:07.070
I guarantee if it was you and not her,

23:07.070 --> 23:09.220
your wife would be (bleep)
some stranger right now

23:09.220 --> 23:10.370
to forget about you.

23:10.370 --> 23:11.350
- [Jonathan] No she wouldn't.

23:11.350 --> 23:14.301
- What is it going to take for
you to give yourself to me?

23:14.301 --> 23:16.265
- It's not you.

23:16.265 --> 23:17.098
- It's me.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.220
- You're not Miranda.

23:22.220 --> 23:23.770
- Oh yes I am.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.770
I look like Miranda, I smell like Miranda,

23:26.770 --> 23:28.790
I even taste like Miranda.

23:28.790 --> 23:31.243
I guess I'm Miranda.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.720
- No.

23:32.720 --> 23:35.520
- I thought you wanted to be
together with me, Jonathan.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.014
- No.

23:39.014 --> 23:42.320
- I can't control myself
when I'm around you, Jon.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.153
- No!

23:50.199 --> 23:53.032
(water splashing)

24:06.273 --> 24:08.210
- You're a hard sell.

24:08.210 --> 24:11.440
I've never had to work so hard
to get somebody to want me.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.660
I hope you don't mind.

24:12.660 --> 24:13.840
I'm taking a bath.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.163
I've been so dirty.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.510
- Doesn't matter if you wash
off what's on the outside.

24:21.520 --> 24:22.700
It's the heart that matters.

24:22.700 --> 24:25.810
- Well spoken, but what
if I don't have a heart?

24:25.810 --> 24:27.480
I'm heartless, Jonathan.

24:27.480 --> 24:28.993
I just need some attention.

24:29.980 --> 24:31.160
- What do you mean?

24:31.160 --> 24:34.590
- Your wife, she meant to help them.

24:34.590 --> 24:36.900
What she didn't realize is she made it

24:36.900 --> 24:39.500
really difficult for them to survive.

24:39.500 --> 24:42.363
Join me and we can protect them together.

24:43.390 --> 24:45.170
- You're just trying to use them.

24:45.170 --> 24:47.973
- What am I going to
do, marry one of them?

24:48.980 --> 24:51.640
- Lucy is on the fence
about which way she goes.

24:51.640 --> 24:55.250
- Good to know, but I'm not on a fence.

24:55.250 --> 24:56.540
I want you.

24:56.540 --> 24:58.090
- [Jonathan] You want me?

24:58.090 --> 24:59.090
- Oh yes.

24:59.090 --> 25:01.140
Don't you want your daughters to be safe?

25:02.500 --> 25:04.820
- They already have each other.

25:04.820 --> 25:06.183
- But that's not enough.

25:07.270 --> 25:11.800
You're good my dear, but
you are not enough alone.

25:11.800 --> 25:16.774
They need a maternal figure,
someone they confide in.

25:16.774 --> 25:18.360
- [Jonathan] That would be you?

25:18.360 --> 25:20.290
- If you want it to be.

25:20.290 --> 25:24.887
You, let's face it,
you're a little pent up.

25:26.420 --> 25:30.170
- [Jonathan] What are
we gonna do about that?

25:31.236 --> 25:34.569
(upbeat romantic music)

26:23.416 --> 26:25.666
(knocking)

26:29.968 --> 26:31.763
- What the hell do you want groupie?

26:32.900 --> 26:34.320
If you're for Mina you chicken shit,

26:34.320 --> 26:35.660
you better back the hell off.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.290
She doesn't wanna talk to you.

26:37.290 --> 26:39.360
- I'm not here for Mina.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.470
- Then what the hell are you here for?

26:41.470 --> 26:43.330
- I'm here to fix your AC unit.

26:43.330 --> 26:45.180
- Why didn't you say so?

26:45.180 --> 26:46.260
- I tried to.

26:46.260 --> 26:48.365
You're due for your yearly check-up.

26:48.365 --> 26:52.290
- You want me to show it to
you, the AC unit that is?

26:52.290 --> 26:54.708
- No, I'm pretty sure I can find it.

26:54.708 --> 26:56.480
- I'm not doing anything.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.669
You want me to walk around with you?

26:58.669 --> 27:00.053
- Sure, if you want to.

27:07.039 --> 27:10.039
(slow dreamy music)

27:36.743 --> 27:39.110
You know, you don't have to stay out here

27:39.110 --> 27:40.510
if you have somewhere to be.

27:41.560 --> 27:42.650
- I don't.

27:42.650 --> 27:43.543
What if I wanna watch you just in case

27:43.543 --> 27:45.093
I wanna do it next time?

27:46.870 --> 27:49.480
- You gonna remember all
of this a year from now?

27:49.480 --> 27:51.333
- Hopefully by then I'll be moved on.

27:52.340 --> 27:53.290
- What do you mean?

27:54.480 --> 27:57.730
- I'm nearly 30 and I still live at home

27:57.730 --> 27:59.423
with my dad and my sister.

28:00.934 --> 28:03.700
- You know, I actually did
see a statistic that said

28:03.700 --> 28:06.060
25% of college graduates plan on

28:06.060 --> 28:09.838
moving back in with their
parents as soon as they graduate.

28:09.838 --> 28:12.073
- I'm not a college grad.

28:13.270 --> 28:16.713
My mom died when I was
a senior in high school.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.030
- Sorry to hear about that.

28:21.210 --> 28:22.163
- I still miss her.

28:23.220 --> 28:26.420
I guess that's why I've
been going through a phase.

28:26.420 --> 28:27.583
- What kind of phase?

28:28.800 --> 28:29.670
- The way I dress.

28:29.670 --> 28:31.220
Everybody thinks I'm a lesbian.

28:32.130 --> 28:33.360
- Aren't you?

28:33.360 --> 28:36.060
- Why are you curious?

28:36.060 --> 28:40.500
- I usually have a radar
that's pretty spot on.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.703
I guess you're just
giving it mixed signals.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.350
- I do that on purpose.

28:45.350 --> 28:47.680
If a guy thought I was straight,

28:47.680 --> 28:50.360
then they would never leave me alone.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.260
Poor Mina, all the attention's on her.

28:53.255 --> 28:55.550
- Is Mina your sister?

28:55.550 --> 28:56.383
- [Lucy] Yeah.

28:56.383 --> 28:57.216
Don't get any ideas.

28:58.086 --> 29:02.180
- Mina has all the luck
with the guys, huh?

29:02.180 --> 29:03.290
- They don't care about her.

29:03.290 --> 29:04.543
They just want her money.

29:05.899 --> 29:07.650
- [Worker] That's not
all a relationship is

29:07.650 --> 29:09.050
supposed to be based off of.

29:10.180 --> 29:12.880
- What do you think a
relationship should be based on?

29:14.005 --> 29:16.640
- I can't give away all of my secrets.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.540
- [Lucy] Right now, I'm an open book.

29:18.540 --> 29:19.943
You can ask me anything.

29:23.700 --> 29:28.700
- When was the last time
you...had these coils changed?

29:29.470 --> 29:30.763
They're dirty as can be.

29:31.993 --> 29:33.100
- I don't know.

29:33.100 --> 29:34.810
That's a dad question.

29:34.810 --> 29:35.823
- Is your dad here?

29:36.850 --> 29:37.950
- [Lucy] No, he's not.

29:38.883 --> 29:41.963
- Don't go throwing any wild parties.

29:41.963 --> 29:43.963
- [Lucy] I wasn't planning on it.

29:45.650 --> 29:49.774
- What were you planning
on, having dinner?

29:49.774 --> 29:51.333
A girl's gotta eat too, right?

29:52.827 --> 29:57.767
- Every once in awhile, I
do this thing called eating.

29:57.767 --> 29:59.690
- [Worker] Every once in awhile.

29:59.690 --> 30:01.540
Do you ever do it with somebody else?

30:02.870 --> 30:03.703
- I don't know.

30:03.703 --> 30:06.563
If my dad's not home, he
can't give me his permission.

30:08.678 --> 30:13.678
- You're almost 30 and you
dress like you like other girls

30:14.808 --> 30:16.563
just to scare off men?

30:18.280 --> 30:21.013
Since when do you need
anybody else's permission?

30:37.712 --> 30:41.129
(mysterious piano music)

30:44.070 --> 30:45.987
- Who the hell are you?

30:48.900 --> 30:50.610
- [Jonathan] Mina, this is D.

30:50.610 --> 30:52.550
She'll be staying with us for awhile.

30:52.550 --> 30:53.523
- Staying with us?

30:54.385 --> 30:55.300
For how long?

30:55.300 --> 30:56.850
- [Jonathan] Until the wedding.

30:57.887 --> 30:59.437
- I'm not getting married, dad.

31:00.701 --> 31:01.853
- But we are.

31:04.270 --> 31:06.060
- [Mina] How long have you known her?

31:06.060 --> 31:07.940
- She's an old friend.

31:07.940 --> 31:10.110
Even though we've been away,

31:10.110 --> 31:12.310
I've always felt like
she's been by my side.

31:13.210 --> 31:14.601
- [Mina] You gotta be kidding me.

31:14.601 --> 31:15.434
(woman hisses)

31:15.434 --> 31:17.020
- [Jonathan] I'm definitely not.

31:17.020 --> 31:17.930
Save the date.

31:24.620 --> 31:25.620
- Dad?

31:25.620 --> 31:26.453
- Hello Lucy.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.720
There's someone I would like you to meet.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.210
This is D.

31:31.210 --> 31:32.840
She sent the postcard.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.960
- You sent my dad a postcard?

31:34.960 --> 31:36.450
Who does that anymore?

31:36.450 --> 31:37.610
- I do.

31:37.610 --> 31:39.550
It's something nice about getting to

31:39.550 --> 31:40.963
put something in your hand.

31:43.240 --> 31:46.263
- D will be with us for
awhile, until the wedding.

31:48.070 --> 31:49.480
- Mina's getting married?

31:49.480 --> 31:51.067
- [Jonathan] No, but we are.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.373
- I'm looking forward
to being your mother.

31:56.307 --> 31:57.539
- You will never be my mother!

31:57.539 --> 32:00.372
Who the hell do you think you are?

32:03.967 --> 32:05.339
- I'm sorry about all of this.

32:05.339 --> 32:06.172
- It's all right.

32:06.172 --> 32:07.005
I'm fine.

32:07.005 --> 32:08.843
That child however, she
needs some serious help.

32:15.810 --> 32:16.883
- You again?

32:18.160 --> 32:19.700
- Yes.

32:19.700 --> 32:23.240
It's funny how things come
full circle now, isn't it?

32:23.240 --> 32:24.433
- You're a doctor?

32:25.410 --> 32:26.883
- I'm a psychiatrist.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.050
I'm here to help you sort out any problems

32:30.050 --> 32:31.093
you might be having.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.890
- That word isn't plural, doc.

32:33.890 --> 32:35.913
I don't have problems, I have a problem.

32:37.950 --> 32:39.050
- What's your problem?

32:40.830 --> 32:42.630
- I got home from a date last night.

32:44.060 --> 32:44.963
- A date?

32:45.970 --> 32:47.690
How was she?

32:47.690 --> 32:49.423
- This isn't about the date.

32:51.130 --> 32:53.010
- I need to know as much
information as I can

32:53.010 --> 32:56.793
to put together a good
picture of the problem.

32:59.010 --> 33:00.603
You got back from a date.

33:01.570 --> 33:02.843
How was the date?

33:03.860 --> 33:04.763
- It was fine.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.860
We clicked and had a lot of chemistry.

33:08.830 --> 33:10.920
I get home and I'm in a great mood

33:10.920 --> 33:12.540
and then I see my dad sitting in

33:12.540 --> 33:14.590
a colored recliner with that crazy woman.

33:16.380 --> 33:17.983
- How do you know she was crazy?

33:19.205 --> 33:21.980
- I just got that vibe from her.

33:21.980 --> 33:24.290
She's sitting there and
I've never seen her before.

33:24.290 --> 33:25.951
Then my dad tells me
they're getting married

33:25.951 --> 33:28.113
and she said she's gonna be my mom?

33:31.050 --> 33:32.973
- She's marrying your dad, isn't she?

33:33.970 --> 33:36.970
She will be your mom,
legally speaking anyway.

33:36.970 --> 33:38.590
- You're missing the point.

33:38.590 --> 33:39.750
I have never seen her before.

33:39.750 --> 33:41.653
She said she's gonna be my mom!

33:42.830 --> 33:44.580
- Maybe it was love at first sight.

33:45.470 --> 33:47.913
- Maybe, but that doesn't make her my mom.

33:49.270 --> 33:50.670
- You decided to attack her.

33:51.550 --> 33:52.650
- I lost it.

33:52.650 --> 33:53.520
- You lost what?

33:53.520 --> 33:55.020
- My cool!

33:55.020 --> 33:57.450
- That doesn't seem too hard to believe,

33:57.450 --> 33:58.883
having known you before.

34:00.670 --> 34:02.713
You seem to have a short fuse.

34:03.910 --> 34:05.990
What pushed you over the edge?

34:05.990 --> 34:08.703
You were a little bit
frazzled, weren't you?

34:09.659 --> 34:10.513
- She did.

34:13.179 --> 34:16.969
- Because she said that she
was going to be your mother?

34:16.969 --> 34:19.949
- You're telling me that if
someone came into this room

34:19.949 --> 34:21.810
that you've never seen and she
says she's gonna be your mom,

34:21.810 --> 34:23.500
you wouldn't flip out?

34:23.500 --> 34:24.503
- No, I wouldn't.

34:25.760 --> 34:29.023
My parents are still
together and happily married.

34:30.520 --> 34:33.070
I have a hard time empathizing
with your situation.

34:34.210 --> 34:36.429
- My parents aren't divorced.

34:36.429 --> 34:38.023
My mom's dead!

34:39.560 --> 34:43.713
- Yes, they are divorced,
'til death do you part, right?

34:45.239 --> 34:46.850
What, are you gonna get angry just because

34:46.850 --> 34:48.243
I tell you the truth?

34:50.373 --> 34:51.763
Who's the gatekeeper now?

35:02.920 --> 35:04.120
- What's wrong with her?

35:06.480 --> 35:09.460
- Some people cope with
things in different ways,

35:09.460 --> 35:11.823
you know, stress, duress.

35:12.926 --> 35:15.040
Your daughter's been lashing out very

35:15.040 --> 35:16.730
violently against people and she's

35:16.730 --> 35:20.200
a danger to herself and
everyone else around her.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.160
We're gonna have to keep her in

35:21.160 --> 35:25.340
solitary confinement until
she calms down a good bit.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.125
After that, we might be able to get her

35:27.125 --> 35:28.723
into some group therapy.

35:30.627 --> 35:32.673
- Is this really the
best treatment for her?

35:32.673 --> 35:33.713
- Yes, definitely.

35:34.690 --> 35:37.310
We can't have her having another episode.

35:37.310 --> 35:39.867
As long as she's reacting
violently to people,

35:39.867 --> 35:42.367
we're gonna have to keep
her under close scrutiny.

35:43.870 --> 35:48.870
I promise sir, I will keep
Lucy under close watch.

35:50.550 --> 35:51.383
- Thank you doctor.

35:51.383 --> 35:52.216
- Yes.

36:01.170 --> 36:02.363
- Hey, hey.

36:03.973 --> 36:06.470
At least I have someone
in the cell next to me.

36:06.470 --> 36:08.770
Drives me crazy not
having someone to talk to.

36:10.440 --> 36:12.610
- How long have you been here?

36:12.610 --> 36:13.700
- For too long.

36:13.700 --> 36:15.760
I just wish they would set me free,

36:15.760 --> 36:19.052
but they say I'm a danger
to those around me.

36:19.052 --> 36:21.096
- What are you talking to me for?

36:21.096 --> 36:22.700
- We're neighbors.

36:22.700 --> 36:25.000
I just wanted to get to know you.

36:25.000 --> 36:25.913
What's your name?

36:26.950 --> 36:28.161
- Lucy.

36:28.161 --> 36:29.565
- [Patient] I love Lucy.

36:29.565 --> 36:30.960
(woman laughs)

36:30.960 --> 36:32.093
Why are you here?

36:33.790 --> 36:35.940
- Because I'm a danger to those around me.

36:35.940 --> 36:37.390
- Are you?

36:37.390 --> 36:39.370
Good thing there's a wall here.

36:39.370 --> 36:40.653
Did you hear the master?

36:42.320 --> 36:43.450
- What?

36:43.450 --> 36:46.743
- Master speaks to me when I'm asleep.

36:47.760 --> 36:48.910
- Who is he?

36:48.910 --> 36:51.290
- Not he, she.

36:51.290 --> 36:52.910
She's all powerful.

36:52.910 --> 36:54.230
She's a ruler of the night.

36:54.230 --> 36:57.350
She commands to darkness
and I pledge allegiance.

36:57.350 --> 36:58.573
You should as well.

36:59.530 --> 37:01.403
- Leave me alone.

37:01.403 --> 37:04.250
- You're in solitary confinement.

37:04.250 --> 37:05.930
You're already alone,

37:05.930 --> 37:08.807
but just because there are bars,
just because there's walls,

37:08.807 --> 37:12.130
doesn't mean the master can't find you.

37:12.130 --> 37:13.623
- [Patient] She's right you know.

37:17.550 --> 37:18.860
- [D] Hello Mina.

37:18.860 --> 37:19.900
- Get away from me.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.130
- No need to be hostile.

37:21.130 --> 37:22.950
I'm just here for business.

37:22.950 --> 37:23.940
- What?

37:23.940 --> 37:26.110
- [D] I'm the regional
manager of the store.

37:26.110 --> 37:26.943
- Don't lie.

37:26.943 --> 37:27.776
- Seriously.

37:27.776 --> 37:29.350
You and I are gonna be seeing
a lot more of one another.

37:29.350 --> 37:31.570
You wanna follow me to
the deli sit down area?

37:31.570 --> 37:33.580
- No, I'm not gonna talk with you.

37:33.580 --> 37:34.960
I'm gonna ask Mr. Randall about this.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.360
- You know where to find me.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.593
Mina, have a seat.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.503
- [Mina] Mr. Randall
says you're corporate.

37:44.885 --> 37:46.260
I still don't believe you.

37:46.260 --> 37:48.820
- Think you just have a
problem with authority, Mina.

37:48.820 --> 37:50.360
- I'm recording this.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.190
- [D] If you feel that
you must, go right ahead.

37:52.190 --> 37:54.756
Very professional of
you to cover your basis.

37:54.756 --> 37:55.943
- What do you want?

37:55.943 --> 37:57.090
- [D] I just came to talk to you about

37:57.090 --> 37:58.370
your career life here.

37:58.370 --> 37:59.720
How old are you Mina?

37:59.720 --> 38:00.553
- 18.

38:00.553 --> 38:02.070
- 18.

38:02.070 --> 38:02.903
That's great.

38:02.903 --> 38:05.050
You're already in a
department, but right now,

38:05.050 --> 38:07.830
you're working part-time,
little four to five hour shifts.

38:07.830 --> 38:10.884
The store manager doesn't even
think that you can handle it.

38:10.884 --> 38:12.290
- [Mina] I can.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.420
- The store manager
doesn't think that you can

38:14.420 --> 38:16.790
and I honestly don't think that you can.

38:16.790 --> 38:19.210
You're going to be 28
working here part-time.

38:19.210 --> 38:20.113
Do you know why?

38:21.890 --> 38:23.480
Because you're a problem.

38:23.480 --> 38:25.431
We don't promote problems.

38:25.431 --> 38:27.390
You're like a little kid.

38:27.390 --> 38:30.780
You're immature, you think
you're good at your job.

38:30.780 --> 38:31.940
- [Mina] Yes.

38:31.940 --> 38:32.773
- You're not.

38:32.773 --> 38:36.560
You're a slob, you always
wear your shirt un-tucked,

38:36.560 --> 38:39.443
you never wear your name
tag, you're pathetic.

38:40.460 --> 38:42.530
- I'm showing the company this video.

38:42.530 --> 38:43.740
- I'm scared.

38:43.740 --> 38:46.713
Who are you going to show,
who are you going to call?

38:46.713 --> 38:49.403
Do you wanna call corporate now or later?

38:50.290 --> 38:53.290
You aren't going to amount to
anything at this organization.

39:11.901 --> 39:13.860
- [Van] Bad day?

39:13.860 --> 39:15.130
- Just leave me alone.

39:15.130 --> 39:16.880
- [Van] Want a cigarette?

39:16.880 --> 39:17.823
- Just go!

39:20.350 --> 39:22.150
- My doctor says they're bad for me,

39:23.030 --> 39:24.220
but I don't believe him.

39:24.220 --> 39:26.523
Maybe I just like living life on the edge.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.400
- Why are you talking to me?

39:30.400 --> 39:31.987
- Just making conversation,

39:32.857 --> 39:35.790
thought maybe you want
somebody real to talk to.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.160
I guess I was wrong.

39:37.160 --> 39:37.993
- What do you mean?

39:37.993 --> 39:39.060
- Have a nice day.

39:39.060 --> 39:40.010
- What do you mean?

39:41.670 --> 39:43.083
- I know what's going on.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.690
I know why you can't see anything

39:45.690 --> 39:47.090
on that video you just took.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.550
I've been following your situation.

39:51.861 --> 39:55.570
Usually I don't get to say these words,

39:55.570 --> 39:57.820
but that lady who wants
to marry your father,

39:58.950 --> 39:59.783
she's a vampire.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.117
- Who are you?

40:04.090 --> 40:05.833
- The name is Van.

40:06.930 --> 40:07.953
I'm a bounty hunter.

40:09.520 --> 40:13.383
This lady's been terrorizing
people for quite some time.

40:15.090 --> 40:16.570
She caught my attention the other day

40:16.570 --> 40:18.950
because a former colleague called me

40:18.950 --> 40:20.493
from the mental institution,

40:21.670 --> 40:26.283
saw something particular on
the closed-circuit television.

40:27.150 --> 40:29.303
A man talking to thin air,

40:30.292 --> 40:33.233
holding the door open for thin air.

40:36.400 --> 40:40.180
I looked up that poor
schmuck, I followed him home

40:41.436 --> 40:42.269
and I saw her.

40:43.785 --> 40:45.233
Then I followed her here.

40:46.220 --> 40:48.930
I watched, I learned.

40:50.400 --> 40:52.390
- Is she really from corporate?

40:52.390 --> 40:54.653
- Could be, but if she's a vampire,

40:55.869 --> 40:59.893
she's probably got men under her spell.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.900
- What does she want from me?

41:03.900 --> 41:08.123
- She wants you out of her way,
your sister out of the way.

41:10.668 --> 41:12.068
She doesn't want you at all.

41:13.130 --> 41:14.490
She wants your father.

41:14.490 --> 41:16.403
Use him up, he's a resource.

41:17.340 --> 41:18.534
- Use him up?

41:18.534 --> 41:23.534
- Either as a sex slave or kill him.

41:24.710 --> 41:26.420
- What about the letter?

41:26.420 --> 41:27.942
- No one will be warned.

41:27.942 --> 41:29.027
Think about it.

41:29.027 --> 41:30.770
What is a marriage?

41:30.770 --> 41:32.613
It's a holy matrimony.

41:34.080 --> 41:38.210
Vampires are evil and all religious sides

41:38.210 --> 41:39.883
need symbols to repel them.

41:44.282 --> 41:47.163
- My father hasn't been wearing
his wedding ring lately.

41:49.811 --> 41:51.711
- When was the last time you saw that?

41:53.970 --> 41:56.343
- He went to Transylvania.

41:57.310 --> 41:59.920
- You see, she made him take it off.

41:59.920 --> 42:02.000
I guess that's where I'm headed.

42:02.000 --> 42:02.963
- I'm going with you.

42:02.963 --> 42:05.310
- This ain't your fight.

42:05.310 --> 42:06.680
- But it's my father and I'm not gonna

42:06.680 --> 42:08.963
sit around and let that
bitch keep her fangs in him.

42:10.643 --> 42:12.177
- I thought that's what you'd say.

42:17.755 --> 42:20.555
(knocking)

42:20.555 --> 42:21.388
- [D] Yes?

42:25.140 --> 42:25.973
- Is Mina home?

42:25.973 --> 42:27.790
- She's still at work.

42:27.790 --> 42:31.210
- I just checked in there
and I didn't see her.

42:31.210 --> 42:33.267
- I'm sorry to hear that.

42:33.267 --> 42:34.350
I just don't understand why she'd

42:34.350 --> 42:36.940
leave someone as good
looking as you hanging.

42:36.940 --> 42:39.177
- Are you her sister?

42:39.177 --> 42:41.780
- Can we quit talking about Mina?

42:41.780 --> 42:43.080
It shouldn't matter who I am.

42:43.080 --> 42:45.410
It should only matter how you feel.

42:45.410 --> 42:47.110
- How I feel?

42:47.110 --> 42:48.373
- How you feel right now.

42:48.373 --> 42:49.892
- What do you mean?

42:49.892 --> 42:51.559
- Don't you want me?

42:53.315 --> 42:54.765
- I don't even know you lady.

42:56.210 --> 42:57.183
- Does it matter?

42:58.890 --> 43:00.940
- I don't mess around
with people I don't know.

43:00.940 --> 43:02.260
- We ain't gonna be messing around.

43:02.260 --> 43:04.510
We're gonna be getting
straight to the point.

43:05.570 --> 43:06.960
- I'm gonna go.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.850
Can you tell Mina that I came by?

43:08.850 --> 43:11.230
- One thing about male arrival

43:11.230 --> 43:13.628
is all the blood that's
pumping down there.

43:13.628 --> 43:15.097
(woman hisses)

43:15.097 --> 43:17.930
(dangerous music)

43:23.483 --> 43:26.731
You know, had you played your cards right,

43:26.731 --> 43:30.040
you could've been one of my love slaves.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.973
But no, you weren't interested.

43:33.730 --> 43:34.683
Fatal mistake.

43:47.560 --> 43:49.190
- Hey you.

43:49.190 --> 43:51.750
You wanna know what the
master said for you to do?

43:51.750 --> 43:52.830
- [Lucy] No.

43:52.830 --> 43:54.480
- Kill yourself.

43:54.480 --> 43:56.663
Open up your wrist and let the blood flow.

43:58.120 --> 44:00.630
- I'm a little tied up right now.

44:00.630 --> 44:01.940
- [Patient] Bash your
head against the wall

44:01.940 --> 44:03.453
until your brains are no more.

44:04.750 --> 44:07.190
- I don't hate myself that much.

44:07.190 --> 44:09.420
Can you just leave me alone?

44:09.420 --> 44:11.090
- I would if the master
would leave me alone,

44:11.090 --> 44:13.340
but she doesn't like you.

44:13.340 --> 44:16.720
She doesn't want you to
interfere with her plans.

44:16.720 --> 44:18.680
- [Lucy] What are her plans?

44:18.680 --> 44:21.780
- She's turning your father
into one of her kind.

44:21.780 --> 44:23.353
- How can she be stopped?

44:24.250 --> 44:25.510
- Very clever.

44:25.510 --> 44:27.561
I'm not giving you information to

44:27.561 --> 44:30.470
tell you how to hurt my master.

44:30.470 --> 44:33.450
That's something you will just
have to figure out yourself

44:33.450 --> 44:35.200
if you ever get out of here.

44:35.200 --> 44:37.580
Master wants you to die here.

44:37.580 --> 44:39.980
- I'll die when I'm good and ready.

44:39.980 --> 44:42.700
- I'll remind you every five minutes.

44:42.700 --> 44:44.420
- Shut the (bleep) up or I'll find a way

44:44.420 --> 44:47.270
to come over there and bash
your brains against the wall.

44:53.907 --> 44:56.840
- How long have you been doing this?

44:56.840 --> 44:58.590
- What, driving?

44:58.590 --> 44:59.803
Since I was 16.

45:01.833 --> 45:03.916
- I meant bounty hunting.

45:05.153 --> 45:09.210
- I dabbled in it since I
dropped out of high school.

45:09.210 --> 45:11.300
I didn't like high school too much.

45:11.300 --> 45:13.089
I didn't fit in.

45:13.089 --> 45:14.289
- I don't fit in either.

45:16.610 --> 45:19.130
- Such a lonely road.

45:19.130 --> 45:21.183
Bounty hunting's a good paycheck and all,

45:22.250 --> 45:27.250
but the more dangerous it
is, then bigger paycheck.

45:28.760 --> 45:32.320
Family put up the funds for all of this.

45:35.006 --> 45:36.623
That's the Reinhart family.

45:38.140 --> 45:42.580
The queen corrupted
her, killed the brother,

45:42.580 --> 45:43.943
the father, and the son.

45:45.780 --> 45:48.630
Grandfather's the one putting
up all the moneys for this.

45:49.510 --> 45:54.510
Anything I need to get old
queen, it's at my disposal.

45:56.140 --> 45:57.783
- What do you need to do that?

45:59.030 --> 46:00.460
- There's a wide variety of things,

46:00.460 --> 46:04.182
but the thing that works
best is religious symbols,

46:04.182 --> 46:06.533
holy water, scriptures.

46:07.860 --> 46:09.583
I've got plenty of all of those.

46:14.540 --> 46:16.726
Nothing can keep them mother fuckers

46:16.726 --> 46:19.777
at a distance better than one of these.

46:19.777 --> 46:20.610
- What about me?

46:20.610 --> 46:21.639
You have another one of those?

46:21.639 --> 46:22.472
- Yup.

46:22.472 --> 46:23.772
This here's my side piece.

46:26.610 --> 46:27.583
- How is that fair?

46:28.849 --> 46:31.007
- At least you didn't get a water bottle.

46:31.007 --> 46:32.450
(man chuckles)

46:32.450 --> 46:33.750
You can still squirt them.

46:34.782 --> 46:38.282
(suspenseful piano music)

46:45.570 --> 46:47.450
Keep your eyes open.

46:47.450 --> 46:49.010
- [Mina] What are we looking for?

46:49.010 --> 46:50.440
- [Van] Something shiny.

46:50.440 --> 46:54.546
The wedding ring should glimmer
if you shine a light on it.

46:54.546 --> 46:55.624
Here.

46:55.624 --> 46:58.624
(suspenseful music)

47:51.452 --> 47:52.702
- Hello pretty.

47:57.739 --> 47:59.072
Watch your step.

48:00.076 --> 48:02.493
You shouldn't play with guns.

48:06.811 --> 48:09.311
(woman yells)

48:20.006 --> 48:22.506
(woman yells)

48:35.893 --> 48:36.833
- Nice work kid.

48:37.794 --> 48:38.644
You got the ring?

48:40.453 --> 48:45.224
(woman yells)
(man hushes)

48:45.224 --> 48:46.224
- Come here.

48:49.140 --> 48:51.152
It's not gonna help if you scream.

48:51.152 --> 48:52.780
Nobody can even hear you.

48:52.780 --> 48:55.290
Nobody can hear you.

48:55.290 --> 48:58.533
It's just you and me,
it's just you and me here.

49:04.948 --> 49:07.615
You are very pretty, aren't you?

49:09.337 --> 49:11.037
You trying to say something to me?

49:12.240 --> 49:13.890
What's that you're trying to say?

49:15.796 --> 49:18.170
You don't think you should
be here in the first place,

49:18.170 --> 49:19.530
is that it?

49:19.530 --> 49:22.180
You think that you've been
wrongfully placed in here?

49:23.900 --> 49:25.253
That's not it, is it?

49:27.010 --> 49:28.860
Are you gonna be good, gonna be good?

49:30.070 --> 49:31.790
Let's hear what you have to say.

49:31.790 --> 49:33.060
What did you wanna say?

49:33.060 --> 49:34.010
- [Lucy] Thank you.

49:35.550 --> 49:36.383
- Thank you?

49:37.937 --> 49:40.690
I haven't even done anything to you yet.

49:40.690 --> 49:41.760
- Yes you have.

49:46.870 --> 49:50.690
You know, you can ask me
questions if you'd like.

49:50.690 --> 49:52.202
- I believe we're to the point where I

49:52.202 --> 49:56.173
pick you up from a mental
institution without any questions.

49:57.220 --> 49:59.283
- I'm glad you trust me so much.

50:00.810 --> 50:01.960
- Do you wanna go home?

50:02.930 --> 50:05.620
- I have a problem that needs fixing

50:05.620 --> 50:09.320
and I'd really appreciate your help.

50:09.320 --> 50:11.690
- Something wrong with your AC?

50:11.690 --> 50:12.523
- No.

50:12.523 --> 50:14.053
You did a good job of that already.

50:15.510 --> 50:17.773
I want you to kill my future stepmother.

50:20.510 --> 50:21.983
- Tell me you're not serious?

50:25.220 --> 50:26.893
Shit, you are serious.

50:29.147 --> 50:31.513
I'm not sure that's really a good idea.

50:32.580 --> 50:33.923
- She's a monster.

50:34.760 --> 50:36.713
- I'm sure she can't be that bad.

50:37.950 --> 50:39.850
- You'll probably find her attractive.

50:40.730 --> 50:41.813
- What if she had short red hair and

50:41.813 --> 50:45.380
wearing a straight jacket?

50:45.380 --> 50:48.370
Those are the only kind of
girls I find attractive.

50:48.370 --> 50:49.230
- Whatever.

50:49.230 --> 50:50.063
Take me home.

50:56.752 --> 50:59.419
(door creaking)

51:05.830 --> 51:07.300
- [D] Welcome home Mina.

51:07.300 --> 51:08.890
You've been a busy girl.

51:08.890 --> 51:11.670
Skipping out on work
to go after something?

51:11.670 --> 51:13.660
Bet you feel real safe right now

51:13.660 --> 51:16.023
because you have the home field advantage.

51:16.970 --> 51:18.613
Let's change that up a bit.

51:19.750 --> 51:21.203
Welcome to my world.

51:22.313 --> 51:25.730
(dangerous violin music)

51:38.054 --> 51:40.223
- [Man] Why can't we
just talk this through?

51:40.223 --> 51:42.556
(man yells)

51:58.230 --> 51:59.800
- Turn around bitch.

51:59.800 --> 52:02.750
- What kind of way is that
to talk to your mother?

52:02.750 --> 52:04.460
- You're weak, aren't you?

52:04.460 --> 52:06.640
Your little slaves are gone.

52:06.640 --> 52:09.133
My father's the only one you have left.

52:09.133 --> 52:12.288
- Yes, I am weak, but
you forget one thing.

52:12.288 --> 52:13.233
I have you.

52:16.010 --> 52:17.450
- Dad, what are you doing?

52:17.450 --> 52:21.200
- He's under my spell and
soon, you will be too.

52:21.200 --> 52:22.900
Don't try to fight it.

52:22.900 --> 52:26.073
It's too late for love,
too late for mercy.

52:27.370 --> 52:29.430
- What made you this way?

52:29.430 --> 52:33.017
- [Old Woman] I remember I
was like you a long time ago.

52:34.980 --> 52:37.070
- I was young and beautiful.

52:37.070 --> 52:39.519
It was the age of exploration.

52:39.519 --> 52:42.520
I was put into captivity.

52:42.520 --> 52:45.460
They didn't feed me enough.

52:45.460 --> 52:47.363
They only used me for my sex.

52:48.680 --> 52:50.990
I realized the only way I could survive

52:50.990 --> 52:53.073
was to exploit the ones around me.

52:54.317 --> 52:58.063
I began to suck their blood,
draining their life force.

52:59.220 --> 53:03.023
Soon, their power became my power.

53:03.920 --> 53:06.933
It was a shared interest.

53:08.030 --> 53:11.540
Then, I began to change.

53:11.540 --> 53:13.260
- You're gonna be like me.

53:13.260 --> 53:15.639
Be my servant forever.

53:15.639 --> 53:18.306
- Not while I'm still breathing.

53:19.727 --> 53:24.727
(women hiss)
(intense music)

53:54.670 --> 53:56.087
- Sayonara bitch.

54:13.188 --> 54:16.605
(mysterious piano music)

55:08.380 --> 55:09.765
- Dear heavenly father,

55:09.765 --> 55:12.087
we thank you for blessing
you standing upon us

55:12.087 --> 55:13.935
and for this food in front of us

55:13.935 --> 55:15.925
and the love around this table.

55:15.925 --> 55:19.008
(upbeat rock music)
