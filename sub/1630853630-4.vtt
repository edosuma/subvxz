(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:45.250 --> 00:47.458
Ah!

00:51.666 --> 00:53.375
-Morning.
-Good morning.

00:53.458 --> 00:55.166
-Morning, Mbita.
-Ooh! Whoa!

00:55.250 --> 00:57.416
-Whoa.
-(CHUCKLES) Morning, Yukio.

00:59.083 --> 01:00.500
Just the usual, please, Marie.

01:00.583 --> 01:03.750
Hey, do you ever think about putting
new stuff on your menu?

01:03.833 --> 01:06.291
Yeah, I've thought about it, but I can't.

01:06.625 --> 01:08.958
I mean, I could, but I am not.

01:09.416 --> 01:11.833
You know, it's "Just Fish Soup."

01:11.916 --> 01:15.500
My dad always said, "You don't mess up
if you don't mess with a good thing."

01:15.583 --> 01:17.416
(CHUCKLES) All right, fair enough.

01:17.500 --> 01:20.708
But if you ever want to try the best
homemade applesauce in town,

01:20.791 --> 01:21.916
I'm down at booth 12.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.416
Sounds good.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.666
Have a good day, Mbita.

01:25.208 --> 01:26.916
And to ye.

01:28.541 --> 01:29.625
Okay.

01:31.458 --> 01:32.666
And to ye.

01:32.750 --> 01:34.375
What? Who says that?

01:35.750 --> 01:36.833
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

01:37.708 --> 01:39.250
(CLASSICAL OPERA MUSIC PLAYING)

02:02.291 --> 02:04.791
(READING) Ah, love. Life. Fish.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.083
I hear you, Dad.

02:08.625 --> 02:09.708
And there you go, Kara,

02:09.791 --> 02:11.166
extra fish, light on the soup.

02:11.250 --> 02:12.791
Just how I like it.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.125
-Got any bread yet?
-Nope.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.583
It's just fish soup.

02:15.666 --> 02:16.791
Sticking with tradition.

02:16.875 --> 02:17.958
-Yep.
-Hi.

02:18.416 --> 02:20.708
I don't suppose you have anything
for this little guy?

02:20.791 --> 02:22.208
Just fish soup. Sorry.

02:22.541 --> 02:25.583
Wait. This guy Yukio
has the best apple sauce.

02:25.666 --> 02:26.833
Right down at booth 12.

02:26.958 --> 02:28.708
-(GASPS) Ah!
-Whoa, dude! Your hand.

02:32.958 --> 02:34.000
What?

02:36.208 --> 02:38.458
Hello, I am Baymax.

02:38.541 --> 02:40.708
I was alerted to the need
for medical attention

02:40.791 --> 02:42.666
when you said, "Ah".

02:43.000 --> 02:45.375
Nope, I don't need medical attention.

02:45.458 --> 02:48.250
I just got a big, weird hand.

02:49.291 --> 02:51.000
-I will scan you now.
-No.

02:51.083 --> 02:53.291
-It is not a big deal.
-Scan complete.

02:53.375 --> 02:56.583
Angioedema is causing
the swelling in your hand.

02:56.666 --> 03:00.375
It is a reaction to the fish intolerance
which you have suddenly developed.

03:00.833 --> 03:02.083
I'm allergic to fish?

03:02.708 --> 03:04.583
What? That's impossible.

03:04.666 --> 03:06.791
My folks and I have
worked with fish for years.

03:06.875 --> 03:09.916
Fish allergy symptoms
can appear at any age

03:10.000 --> 03:12.458
and impact up to 40% of adults.

03:12.833 --> 03:14.125
Huh? (GASPS)

03:14.416 --> 03:15.708
(BEEPING)

03:17.250 --> 03:18.541
You gotta go. Lunch rush.

03:18.625 --> 03:20.000
I'm sure this will just go away.

03:20.083 --> 03:21.750
Thank you for your time.
Please go away.

03:21.833 --> 03:24.458
You should remove fish
from your diet immediately.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.750
Also, the handling of fish when allergic

03:30.833 --> 03:35.000
can cause nausea, cramps,
diarrhea and vomiting.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.041
-What?
-No, no, no.

03:37.125 --> 03:39.208
-Wait, wait, wait.
-ALL: Ew!

03:42.500 --> 03:46.208
Your swelling has begun to spread
and has become itchy.

03:46.291 --> 03:47.291
Uh-uh.

03:47.375 --> 03:49.708
We must remove the fish
from the premises.

03:49.791 --> 03:52.208
No, not the... sea bass.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.083
To reduce inflammation,

03:57.166 --> 03:59.791
I will now inject you
with histamine blockers.

04:01.416 --> 04:03.125
(SHRIEKS) No, thanks.

04:06.208 --> 04:08.041
Many people do not like needles.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.916
(WHIMPERING SOFTLY)

04:16.458 --> 04:17.875
Come on, come on.

04:19.083 --> 04:20.375
Come on, come on, come on.

04:29.208 --> 04:30.791
-(CAR HONKS)
-(GASPS)

04:32.458 --> 04:33.500
Sorry.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.375
Phew.

04:39.541 --> 04:41.416
(SCREAMING)

04:47.250 --> 04:48.375
(GASPS)

04:50.958 --> 04:54.291
Speeding and erratic driving
are not conducive to good health.

04:54.375 --> 04:55.458
Get off of there.

04:55.625 --> 04:56.750
No!

04:59.833 --> 05:01.333
(SCREAMS)

05:06.708 --> 05:08.458
-Baymax.
-Yes?

05:08.541 --> 05:10.875
Will you please give me the shot now?

05:15.416 --> 05:17.291
Thank you for saving my life, Baymax.

05:18.583 --> 05:20.625
Sorry you had to chase me
all over the city.

05:20.708 --> 05:24.541
Mbita, you could die
if you keep working with fish.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.791
(SIGHS)

05:25.875 --> 05:27.083
But fish is all I know.

05:27.625 --> 05:28.666
I grew up in this truck.

05:28.750 --> 05:31.458
My parents, they started
this whole business with nothing.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.333
They were so courageous.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.833
And I'm just... not.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.583
I don't know what's next...

05:40.541 --> 05:41.750
and it terrifies me.

05:43.291 --> 05:46.125
Fear is a natural emotion
when dealing with change

05:46.208 --> 05:47.958
or unpredictable outcomes.

05:51.708 --> 05:55.166
Well, natural or not,
how do I get past this fear?

06:00.333 --> 06:03.541
Could you be courageous like your parents?

06:13.750 --> 06:14.875
Baymax,

06:14.958 --> 06:16.291
we've got some work to do.

06:20.125 --> 06:21.500
Mmm! Mmm-hmm.

06:21.958 --> 06:23.500
(CHUCKLES) Ooh!

06:23.583 --> 06:24.625
Look at these.

06:25.875 --> 06:28.541
Mmm. The heat, the texture.

06:29.125 --> 06:30.250
The flavor.

06:30.333 --> 06:32.041
You know, it's too bad you don't eat.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.500
Whoa. (CHUCKLES)

06:34.458 --> 06:36.166
Hey, Mbita.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.333
What? No fish?

06:37.666 --> 06:38.708
Not today, Yukio.

06:41.541 --> 06:42.583
Also...

06:43.583 --> 06:46.958
I think it would be fun
if me and you went to a place,

06:47.041 --> 06:50.916
or perhaps a thing together.

06:51.875 --> 06:53.791
Are you asking me on a date?

06:53.916 --> 06:55.833
Your pulse and heartbeat have quickened.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.125
No.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.250
Yes.

06:58.708 --> 06:59.708
Yes.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.208
Great. Sounds fun.

07:01.458 --> 07:03.541
Your pituitary gland
is secreting hormones...

07:03.625 --> 07:05.958
Okay, Baymax. Thank you.
That is enough of that.

07:06.041 --> 07:07.708
Hey, is that an apple?

07:07.791 --> 07:08.958
Yeah.

07:09.041 --> 07:10.416
It's a Pacific Rose.

07:10.500 --> 07:11.791
Have you ever had one of these?

07:11.875 --> 07:13.000
They're really sweet.

07:13.625 --> 07:15.208
You are in good health.

07:16.916 --> 07:18.583
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

07:46.625 --> 07:48.208
(SNIFFS) Ugh!

07:48.291 --> 07:49.375
Baymax...

07:49.625 --> 07:51.625
what's with the dead fish smell?

07:51.708 --> 07:53.750
I suspect it is this dead fish.

07:53.833 --> 07:55.500
I brought it home to make sushi.

07:55.583 --> 07:57.625
Oh. Great.
