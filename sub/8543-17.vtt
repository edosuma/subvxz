You agent Lisbon?

00:22.457 --> 00:24.459

- Hey!

00:24.546 --> 00:25.982
Uh, thanks for coming.

00:26.069 --> 00:28.506
I've never called in
CBI before.

00:28.593 --> 00:31.248
Interested to see
your work.

00:31.335 --> 00:34.686
Okay, uh, victim's name
is Lucy Greene.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.949
She was killed
last night around 11:00.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.387
- Throat was slit.
- Charming.

'She had an army ID
On her.'

00:41.780 --> 00:43.782
Says she's active duty.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.958
Corporal. Probably stationed
at Fort Runyon.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.006
That's about two miles
from here, right?

00:50.093 --> 00:52.748
Yeah. Soldiers from the base
come into town all the time.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.097
Uh, if the coroner's
not here,

00:54.184 --> 00:55.707
how did you know
the time of death?

00:55.794 --> 00:58.275
The 9-1-1 call
came in at 11:00.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.190
Fella said that a woman
had just been killed

01:00.277 --> 01:01.713
'across the street
from the church.'

01:01.800 --> 01:03.019
The caller give his name?

01:03.106 --> 01:05.587
No. Uh, operator
asked him to wait

01:05.674 --> 01:07.067
while she
dispatched the car.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.416
When she got back on the line,
he was gone.

01:08.503 --> 01:09.634
Hmm.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.027
[trucks approaching]

01:11.114 --> 01:13.682
- What's that?
- The army.

01:13.769 --> 01:15.118
I figured that.

01:22.212 --> 01:23.909
- Chief Farr?
- Yeah?

01:23.996 --> 01:26.782
Lieutenant Averill Lewis,
Bravo company, second platoon.

01:26.869 --> 01:28.044
Thanks for notifying us.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.308
Oh, damn.

01:31.395 --> 01:32.875
Alright, chief,
we'll take the case from here.

01:32.962 --> 01:35.095
These men are from our criminal
investigation division.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.792
If your officers will let them
have the crime scene?

01:36.879 --> 01:40.317
Um, lieutenant?
I'm Agent Lisbon with the CBI.

01:40.404 --> 01:41.623
Uh, we're handling this.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.320
Ma'am, all due respect,
Corporal Greene

01:43.407 --> 01:44.452
was a medic in my platoon.

01:44.539 --> 01:45.931
This is our responsibility.

01:46.018 --> 01:48.195
I understand
why you would feel that way

01:48.282 --> 01:49.979
but this is our case.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.938
Chief Farr, regs make this
your call, right?

01:53.025 --> 01:55.071
[exhales]
Well, I kind of
expected your agency

01:55.158 --> 01:56.377
to send more than two people.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.248
Our staff is on its way.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.902
Our team is here, chief.

01:59.989 --> 02:01.469
They've closed homicides
on four continents.

02:01.556 --> 02:03.079
That's a good slogan.
Four continents.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.994
What, these guys?

02:05.081 --> 02:07.649
They look like they never
left Salt Lake City.

02:07.736 --> 02:10.434
- Who are you?
- Me? I'm with her.

02:10.521 --> 02:12.784
Uh, Lisbon, you used to play
clarinet, right?

02:12.871 --> 02:14.046
What is that tune?

02:21.315 --> 02:22.446
[Patrick]
'Hmm?'

02:22.533 --> 02:24.796
Yeah. Oh.

02:24.883 --> 02:25.971
It's "Kansas City."

02:27.059 --> 02:28.322
"Kansas City."

it's a classic blues tune.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.302
Uh, she's a fan
of the blues.

02:52.389 --> 02:53.999
Is there a blues club
around here?

02:54.086 --> 02:56.176
Cat's Blues Bar.
It's a couple blocks away.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.178
- Well, that's where she was.
- Or not.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.224

[Averill]
'I'm looking.'

03:04.749 --> 03:06.795
If you looked a little closer
than you're looking

03:06.882 --> 03:09.580
you would see
a slight discoloration.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.669
It's not easy to see,
but if you put that hand

03:11.756 --> 03:14.759
under a UV Light,
you would clearly see a small

03:14.846 --> 03:17.936
but stylized picture of a pink
cat stamped on that hand.

03:18.023 --> 03:20.896

Lieutenant, I think
we can handle this.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.167
Looks that way to me.

03:58.499 --> 04:00.109
What do we know
about Lucy Greene?

04:00.196 --> 04:01.893
She was born and raised
in New Jersey.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.634
Her parents
still live there.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.375
Talked to them.
They were pretty shook up.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.334
Said she seemed pretty happy
the last time they spoke.

04:07.421 --> 04:08.987
She joined the army
after 9/11.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.859
Came back from Afghanistan
with her unit

04:10.946 --> 04:12.513
about two months ago and
received an army commendation.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.123
What for?

04:14.210 --> 04:15.690
She stabilized two
wounded soldiers and hid them

04:15.777 --> 04:17.692
from insurgents
until they could be evac'd.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.085
- She was a good soldier.
- Sounds like it.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.826
Uh, what about
the mystery 9-1-1 caller?

04:21.913 --> 04:23.524
Well, the phone records
confirm that the call

04:23.611 --> 04:25.265
came from a pay phone
near where the body was found.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.788
Supposed to get a recording
of the call later on today.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.180
- E-mail it to me.
- Okay.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.921
Did the victim
have any close friends?

04:30.008 --> 04:32.968

is another medic in the platoon.

there are no hard feelings

04:56.383 --> 04:57.993

of the case

of the platoon a few months ago.

Since my first tour
in Afghanistan.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.355
What was she like?

05:55.442 --> 05:59.271
Smart. Real disciplined.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.666
Lucy didn't have to learn from
mistakes. She didn't make them.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.668
Well, discipline
always comes with a price.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.672
What did she
have trouble with?

06:08.759 --> 06:10.152

Guys in the unit, mostly.

She'd be the first to tell you
she was OCD About the rules.

Real detail-oriented. She'd
point out if you messed up

06:20.249 --> 06:23.818
and that doesn't go down well.
Especially with guys.

- You defended her?
- I tried to.

happen recently?

was sending her flowers.

She wouldn't say
who it was and I think

she was
a little weirded out.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.315
What clinic?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.796
The TBI and psychological
health clinic.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.320
When she wasn't here,
she worked there.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.321

talk about that other thing.

want me to ask you about.

about her.

he just walks away.

No. Comes by herself.

with these soldiers.

on their clothes.

tell me about her?

Vital part of the platoon.
It's a tragedy.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.388
How'd she get along
with the rest of the squad?

09:23.475 --> 09:25.434
- No problems.
- She have any enemies?

09:25.521 --> 09:28.872
Enemies? No.
I mean, people fight.

09:28.959 --> 09:31.962
In my unit, we work it out
and put it behind us.

It takes a unit apart.

was arguing

09:38.273 --> 09:39.404
That's the first
I've heard.

09:39.491 --> 09:40.623
A witness says
some of your men

09:40.710 --> 09:41.798
were arguing
with Corporal Greene

09:41.885 --> 09:43.408
at a bar last night.

09:43.495 --> 09:46.977
- Maybe they are mistaken.
- I don't think so.

09:47.064 --> 09:49.632
I'm gonna have to
talk to your men.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.852
You be my guest,
Agent Cho.

09:51.939 --> 09:53.201
You be my guest.

09:54.985 --> 09:57.597
[intense music]

09:59.903 --> 10:01.949
- Doctor Bowman?
- Yes?

10:02.036 --> 10:04.386
Teresa Lisbon.
Patrick Jane.

10:04.473 --> 10:06.780
We're looking into
the death of Lucy Greene.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.869
Oh, of course.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.741
Have a seat, please.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.138
It's terrible.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.009
On top of everything else,
Lucy's death's

10:19.096 --> 10:21.011
been a real blow
to the program.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.839
She was a tremendous asset.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.536
What's the program?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.669
We treat returning soldiers
for TBI, Traumatic Brain Injury.

10:28.802 --> 10:32.327
And other mental health issues
that result from combat.

10:32.414 --> 10:33.807
Must be busy.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.286
Unfortunately, yes.

10:35.373 --> 10:36.766
There are a lot of people
returning home

10:36.853 --> 10:38.550
with serious problems.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.423
And even minor TBI
can produce sleep deprivation

10:41.510 --> 10:44.208
emotional issues,
memory impairment.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.994
- What did Lucy do?
- She was a battle buddy.

10:47.081 --> 10:50.214
A medic, uh, paired
with one patient

10:50.301 --> 10:52.129
for the course
of treatment.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.958
She was great at it.
Very detail-oriented

10:55.045 --> 10:57.265
but also a huge heart.

10:57.352 --> 10:59.615
Hmm. So you must have
fought with her. Did you?

10:59.702 --> 11:01.008
Why do you say that?

11:01.095 --> 11:04.011
Well, you're a man who's
used to being obeyed

11:04.098 --> 11:05.490
and she wasn't afraid
to speak her mind.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.014
There must have been
some fireworks.

11:07.101 --> 11:09.538
No. We disagreed sometimes.
That happens.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.453
Hmm. Well, I imagine
you've been under

11:11.540 --> 11:13.368
a great deal of stress
since the divorce?

11:14.543 --> 11:15.805
How do you know
I'm divorced?

11:17.285 --> 11:21.768
Well, there's
a number of signs.

11:21.855 --> 11:26.207
I mean, the obvious
is, uh, the overuse of cologne.

11:26.294 --> 11:29.427
You could probably afford to be
a little less liberal with that.

11:29.514 --> 11:30.690
Making my eyes water.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.084
Well, thanks for the tip.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.738
Uh, it's been a little
over a year.

11:35.825 --> 11:38.045
I'm doing quite fine,
actually, thanks for asking.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.742
- Mm, good.
- Great.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.657
[woman on PA]
'Code red in building 21A.'

11:41.744 --> 11:43.572
'Code red in building 21a.'

11:43.659 --> 11:45.922
'Emergency personnel,
please respond.'

11:46.009 --> 11:48.620
- Uh, what's a code red?
- A fire.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.926
It, it's in another building.

11:50.013 --> 11:51.623
The medics on duty
in the hospital

11:51.711 --> 11:53.190
act as the base's EMTs

11:53.277 --> 11:55.802
so they make
an announcement in here.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.325
Is, is there anything else?

11:57.412 --> 12:00.415
Because, uh, I have
patients to see.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.157
Doc? A little help?

12:03.244 --> 12:04.549
Speech and memory class.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.943
Down the hall left,
and left again.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.728
Want someone
to go with you?

12:08.815 --> 12:10.468
I got it. Thanks.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.559
Memory impairment?

12:14.646 --> 12:16.561
Short-term memory's
a real problem.

12:16.648 --> 12:18.868
Things they've seen or heard
just drop out.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.696
- If you'll excuse me.
- Sure.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.964
- Well, come on.
- Why? Where?

12:28.051 --> 12:32.012
Our 9-1-1 caller may not
have run away from the phone.

12:32.099 --> 12:34.014
He may have forgotten
about it. Let's go.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.972
So we're gonna do
an association exercise

12:36.059 --> 12:37.887
'using the cards
that you found on your chairs.'

12:37.974 --> 12:39.584
'It's all about
making connection.'

12:39.671 --> 12:42.805
Re-educating the brain
to put things together.

12:42.892 --> 12:46.330
If I were to show you
a picture like this one

12:46.417 --> 12:48.506
'I want you to show me
the picture from your cards..'

12:48.593 --> 12:49.899
[knock on door]
'that matches or..'

12:49.986 --> 12:52.075
- 'Yes?'
- Sorry for the interruption.

12:52.162 --> 12:53.642
I'm Patrick Jane,
this is Teresa Lisbon.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.122
We're with the CBI.
We're investigating

12:55.209 --> 12:57.211
the murder
of Lucy Greene.

12:57.298 --> 12:58.865
And how can we help you?

12:58.952 --> 13:00.954
We have a recording
made the night of the murder.

13:01.041 --> 13:03.521
Does anyone recognize
this voice?

13:03.608 --> 13:05.349
[man on tape]
'I'm on
Wyoga Lake Avenue.'

13:05.436 --> 13:07.438
'Uh, 20 meters north of the
church. The Saint Sebastian.'

13:07.525 --> 13:09.397
'Somebody just cut her throat.
There's blood all over.'

13:09.484 --> 13:10.964
[woman on tape]
'Okay, sir, I need you
to hold a moment'

13:11.051 --> 13:12.617
'while I dispatch a car.
Will you do that?'

13:12.704 --> 13:14.358
[man on tape]
'Yeah.'

13:14.445 --> 13:18.275
That's my voice.
That's me.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.408
- What's your name?
- Pete Coen.

13:22.236 --> 13:23.977
I don't remember
any of that.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.152
Pete, we need
to talk to you.

13:25.239 --> 13:26.501
Could you come
with me, please?

13:26.588 --> 13:27.807
Uh, yeah, I guess.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.373
Yeah,
that's fine, Pete.

13:29.460 --> 13:30.635
Okay.

13:31.593 --> 13:34.465
[instrumental music]

13:37.164 --> 13:39.166
Uh..

13:39.253 --> 13:40.471
...thank you.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.040
All of you.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.436
Very much.

13:54.181 --> 13:55.486
[Pete on tape]
'I'll wait.'

13:55.573 --> 13:57.314
[woman ontape]
'Thank you, sir.'

13:57.401 --> 14:00.578
'Hello, sir?
Now can you tell me your name?'

14:00.665 --> 14:04.495
'Hello? Sir?
Are you there?'

14:04.582 --> 14:06.802
You forgot why you were there
and you just walked away.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.370
Sounds like something
I'd do.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.200
We found
a date-stamped receipt

14:13.287 --> 14:15.767
from a taco truck
in your wallet.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.248
It parks down the street
from the crime scene.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.207
It's dated
from the night of the killing.

14:21.948 --> 14:24.298
What were you doing
in town?

14:24.385 --> 14:26.082
Uh, walking.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.562
When,when I can't
sleep, I go on walks.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.218
The church
is two miles from the base.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.656
I've got nothing else
to do, ma'am.

14:34.743 --> 14:36.092
I like that church.
I like the bells.

14:38.616 --> 14:41.054
Can you remember anything
that happened that night?

14:42.794 --> 14:43.883
Uh..

14:45.406 --> 14:47.756
No. I'm sorry.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.890
Well, what can
you remember, generally?

14:52.804 --> 14:55.024
Uh, before the explosion's
pretty good.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.113
After that..

14:57.200 --> 14:59.550
and when was
the, the explosion?

14:59.637 --> 15:01.161
11 months ago in Affa.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.859
My squad
was patrolling Khost.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.863
I got out of a Humvee
to eyeball an intersection.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.040
I waved them through.

15:11.127 --> 15:14.783
And they went
right over an IED.

15:18.091 --> 15:20.615
I woke up three days later
in a hospital in Germany.

15:22.008 --> 15:25.489
The other guys..

15:25.576 --> 15:26.751
...they..

15:28.405 --> 15:29.537
...now..

15:31.408 --> 15:33.367
...my memory is gone.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.152
I can't sleep.

15:36.239 --> 15:39.982
I get angry and sad
and I have no idea why.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.945
[cellphone chiming]

15:46.989 --> 15:48.599
Is that to remind you?

15:48.686 --> 15:50.471
Yeah.

15:50.558 --> 15:54.257
"Take meds." which, of course,
I didn't remember.

15:56.172 --> 15:57.391
[sighs]

15:57.478 --> 15:59.349
Government gave it to me.

15:59.436 --> 16:00.916
Um, I'm supposed to..

16:03.919 --> 16:06.356
...supposed to carry it
with me everywhere that I go.

16:06.443 --> 16:07.488
Uh, I have to
write down everything

16:07.575 --> 16:09.055
that I'm supposed to do.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.882
I have to write down
everything that I remember

16:10.970 --> 16:13.189
even if it's in the middle
of the night. Like that helps.

16:14.495 --> 16:15.670
It's useless.

16:17.106 --> 16:20.370
Do you have
a, uh, reminder in here

16:20.457 --> 16:21.893
to buy Lucy some flowers?

16:23.330 --> 16:25.549
How'd you know
I did that?

16:25.636 --> 16:28.770
Oh, your voice
on the 9-1-1 call

16:28.857 --> 16:31.338
sounded like you're
a little more than just friends.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.862
Oh.

16:33.949 --> 16:36.343
I spent a lot of time
with Lucy in the hospital.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.868
She was always really nice.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.089
You start to think..

16:43.176 --> 16:44.786
...maybe there could be
something more, you know?

16:46.005 --> 16:48.355
And..

16:48.442 --> 16:50.096
...she was nice about
the whole thing, but I think

16:50.183 --> 16:52.707
more embarrassed
than anything.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.143
Did Lucy make you angry?

16:55.188 --> 16:57.755
- Uh, I mean...
- Mr.--

16:57.842 --> 17:00.236
Sorry.

17:00.323 --> 17:01.846
[door closes]

17:03.674 --> 17:05.807
Did she?
Make you angry?

17:07.156 --> 17:10.377
- Did who make me angry?
- Lucy?

17:10.464 --> 17:12.118
Lucy Greene?

17:12.205 --> 17:14.511
Why, why are we talking
about Lucy Greene? Did she..

17:14.598 --> 17:15.730
Is she okay?

17:18.341 --> 17:21.040
Lucy's dead.
She was murdered.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.260
What?

17:25.305 --> 17:27.829
[intense music]

17:29.831 --> 17:31.137
Do you think
there's a chance

17:31.224 --> 17:33.356
he'll remember anything
from that night?

17:33.443 --> 17:35.619
Maybe. I-I don't know.

17:35.706 --> 17:38.231
What time did
the 9-1-1 call come in?...

17:38.318 --> 17:40.146
Little bit after 11:00.

17:40.233 --> 17:43.279
Taco. Hmm.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.107
I need to go back
to the crime scene.

17:45.194 --> 17:47.196
- Why?
- Well, I want a taco.

17:53.028 --> 17:55.509
[instrumental music]

17:57.076 --> 17:59.904
Excuse me.
Where does the taco truck park?

17:59.991 --> 18:01.167
Uh, down that way.

18:01.254 --> 18:02.907
Won't be here
for a few hours, though.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.648
Ah. Well, I guess
I'll have to wait.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.261
Gardenias.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.133
Hmm. My favorite.

18:12.743 --> 18:15.268
[music continues]

18:19.054 --> 18:20.316
[yawns]

18:23.189 --> 18:24.755
[groans]

18:28.281 --> 18:30.631
Could Pete have killed her
and forgot he did it?

18:30.718 --> 18:32.633
It's not impossible.
Go to the hospital

18:32.720 --> 18:34.765
and see if anybody saw him
come back that night.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.246
What condition he was in,
if he said anything.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.030
And search his room.
He agreed to it.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.468
- Sure.
- Rigsby..

18:41.555 --> 18:43.774
...he may forget who you are
or why you're there.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.689
Just explain
what's going on gently.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.213
I got it.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.605
Where are we
with Lucy's unit?

18:48.692 --> 18:50.564
Everyone in the platoon
agrees with Hawkins.

18:50.651 --> 18:52.566
Lucy was great.
Nobody had a problem with her.

18:52.653 --> 18:53.958
You think
the waitress misunderstood

18:54.045 --> 18:55.221
what was going on that night
or are they lying?

18:55.308 --> 18:57.092
No. They're lying.

18:57.179 --> 19:00.182
The hospital sent over a list
of patients Lucy worked with.

19:00.269 --> 19:03.272
The most recent one
was a guy named Jacob Lettner.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.795
- See what he has to say.
- Sure.

19:08.103 --> 19:10.323
What exactly
did Lucy do for you, Jacob?

19:10.410 --> 19:13.674
She helped me, uh, keep track
of medications and appointments

19:13.761 --> 19:16.416
kept copies of my paperwork.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.505
When things got difficult
she talked me down

19:18.592 --> 19:21.029
off the ledge.
Like that.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.335
Sounds like you were close.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.253
Yeah. We, uh, we weren't
dating or anything

19:27.340 --> 19:29.168
but I liked her.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.865
When's the last time
you saw her?

19:30.952 --> 19:32.780
Well, I was almost done
with the program,

19:32.867 --> 19:35.870
so I was only seeing her once
a week. Six days ago, I guess.

19:35.957 --> 19:38.655
- How'd she seem?
- Fine.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.527
Did she mention any problems
with the people in her unit?

19:43.356 --> 19:45.967
[indistinct chattering]

19:49.797 --> 19:52.626
She, uh, she asked me not
to tell anyone about this.

19:52.713 --> 19:53.975
Like, begged me.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.370
If Lucy had a problem
with somebody, we need to know.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.330
Couple of weeks ago,
she was really upset..

20:01.417 --> 20:04.812
...crying,
which she never did.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.944
She told me she had filed
a sexual harassment report

20:07.031 --> 20:09.338
anonymously against someone
in the platoon.

20:09.425 --> 20:10.731
Somehow, some
of the guys found out

20:10.818 --> 20:12.123
and they were giving her
crap about it.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.690
What kind of crap?

20:13.777 --> 20:17.999
Just, you know,
stupid stuff, mean.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.087
Who did she file
the claim against?

20:19.174 --> 20:20.480
She wouldn't say.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.133
Well, who in the unit
was giving her trouble?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.658
I don't know names.
A lot of them.

20:26.399 --> 20:30.403
- Sergeant Hawkins, you lied.
- Not true.

20:30.490 --> 20:31.752
You said Lucy had
no problems with the squad

20:31.839 --> 20:33.362
but you knew
she was being punished

20:33.449 --> 20:35.190
because she filed
a sexual harassment complaint.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.061
I knew no such thing.

20:37.148 --> 20:39.325
I had no idea
who filed that complaint.

20:39.412 --> 20:42.284
Now, I was told by
the inspector general's office

20:42.371 --> 20:44.155
that an anonymous complaint
had been filed

20:44.243 --> 20:45.635
against a soldier
in the platoon.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.420
I investigated
that accusation thoroughly.

20:47.507 --> 20:48.943
How'd you do that?

20:49.030 --> 20:50.988
I questioned every man
and woman in the unit.

20:51.075 --> 20:54.383
Not one said they had seen
or experienced any misconduct.

20:54.470 --> 20:57.604
No witnesses,
no intended victim

20:57.691 --> 20:59.736
no investigation,
so I closed it.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.609
You knew some men were harassing
Lucy for making the accusation.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.654
If they were, I never heard
a word about it

21:04.741 --> 21:06.003
and she never said a thing.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.440
She didn't have to.
It's your unit.

21:07.527 --> 21:10.181
It's your job
to know what's going on.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.749
But you thought Lucy had become
a troublemaker didn't you?

21:12.836 --> 21:14.925
You were hoping the backlash
would convince her to transfer.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.494
Is there a question there?

21:18.581 --> 21:19.887
Who was the original
harassment complaint against?

21:19.974 --> 21:21.628
I won't tell you that.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.369
You don't get to choose
which questions you answer.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.893
No? Well, you do
whatever you like.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.025
'Cause I'm not draggin' a good
officer's name through the mud

21:28.112 --> 21:29.462
so that you can go fishing.

21:33.030 --> 21:35.424
Any chance holding Hawkins
will change his mind?

21:35.511 --> 21:37.731
- No.
- Kick him loose, then.

21:37.818 --> 21:40.299
- Something seems off here.
- What?

21:40.386 --> 21:42.997
Everybody says that Lucy
was a stickler for the rules

21:43.084 --> 21:45.434
that she had no problem
speaking up for herself.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.524
But she gets harassed, and she
makes an anonymous complaint?

21:48.611 --> 21:50.744
And when the unit gives her
a hard time about it

21:50.831 --> 21:53.442
she doesn't say anything?
That doesn't sound like her.

21:53.529 --> 21:54.487
Well, she told Lettner
she filed the complaint.

21:54.574 --> 21:56.053
Why would she lie?

21:56.140 --> 21:57.925
Maybe she wanted people
to think she filed it

21:58.012 --> 21:59.622
because she was
protecting someone else.

22:02.016 --> 22:04.584
With your permission, ma'am..

22:04.671 --> 22:06.586
...what's this about?

22:06.673 --> 22:09.893
Rose, there's some people in
the unit think that Lucy filed

22:09.980 --> 22:13.419
an anonymous
sexual harassment complaint.

22:13.506 --> 22:16.335
I think she was taking
the heat for somebody else.

22:16.422 --> 22:19.294
Am I right?

22:19.381 --> 22:23.080
Does this have something to do
with why Lucy was killed?

22:23.167 --> 22:25.169
It might.
I don't know yet.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.825
Was she covering
for you, Rose?

22:32.742 --> 22:34.440
Yes.

22:34.527 --> 22:37.356
There's a hotline
I called about four weeks ago.

22:38.835 --> 22:41.098
Please, don't tell my unit.
Please.

22:44.711 --> 22:47.104
You had to have known
an anonymous accusation

22:47.191 --> 22:49.106
was not gonna do much.

22:49.193 --> 22:53.110
I, I guess I hoped that when
the investigation started

22:53.197 --> 22:54.547
other people would
come forward

22:54.634 --> 22:57.201
so it wouldn't be just me.

22:57.288 --> 22:59.726
But that didn't happen.

22:59.813 --> 23:02.163
And when Hawkins
started the investigation

23:02.250 --> 23:04.818
people assumed it was Lucy?

23:04.905 --> 23:07.342
Because she was so hardcore
about the rules.

23:09.213 --> 23:11.085
She said it was okay,
that she could take it.

23:12.565 --> 23:14.610
But..

23:14.697 --> 23:16.177
...I saw
how much it hurt her.

23:18.135 --> 23:20.268
I just wanted
the whole thing to go away.

23:20.355 --> 23:23.750
So, when Hawkins
questioned me

23:23.837 --> 23:26.709
I, I said I didn't
know anything about it.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.624
Rose..

23:31.192 --> 23:33.020
...who did you name
in the complaint?

23:33.107 --> 23:34.282
Who harassed you?

23:36.153 --> 23:38.504
I, I can't talk about it.
It's against regs.

23:40.244 --> 23:42.638
Hawkins told Cho
that he didn't want

23:42.725 --> 23:45.902
to drag an officer's name
through the mud.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.383
An officer,
not a soldier.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.516
It was Lewis, wasn't it?

23:50.603 --> 23:52.605
Lewis harassed you.

23:52.692 --> 23:54.650
I didn't, I didn't say that.
I'm not saying that.

23:54.737 --> 23:57.566
- Rose..
- Ma'am, I'd like to leave now.

23:57.653 --> 23:58.872
May I?

23:58.959 --> 24:00.090
I can't stop you.
Thanks.

24:05.226 --> 24:07.576
[cellphone ringing]

24:08.708 --> 24:10.536
What's up, Rigsby?

24:10.623 --> 24:12.755
I searched Pete's room.
Didn't find anything.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.148
His clothes
had been taken for washing

24:14.235 --> 24:15.497
so I tracked 'em down
in the laundry.

24:15.584 --> 24:17.107
And?

24:17.194 --> 24:19.414
Found a jacket.
There's bloodstains on it.

24:23.244 --> 24:26.334
Pete is my patient,
and, uh, very fragile.

24:26.421 --> 24:28.336
Do you really need to talk
with him again tonight?

24:28.423 --> 24:30.599
I do.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.601
Well, please keep the questions
short and simple.

24:32.688 --> 24:34.473
Last thing Pete needs
is more stress.

24:38.128 --> 24:41.871
Pete? Put on your shoes.
We're gonna go out.

24:41.958 --> 24:44.831
Oh, sure.
I'd like that.

24:44.918 --> 24:47.007
[cellphone ringing]

24:49.618 --> 24:50.880
[lowered voice]
What is it, Jane?

24:50.967 --> 24:52.795
Uh, Lisbon,
could you bring Pete Coen

24:52.882 --> 24:54.884
to Saint Sebastian Church
in, uh..

24:54.971 --> 24:56.364
[bell tolling]

24:56.451 --> 24:57.800
uh, a little under
an hour?

24:57.887 --> 24:59.976
We found blood on his clothes.

25:00.063 --> 25:01.891
I have to take him
to the office for a talk.

25:01.978 --> 25:04.633
- Uh, won't do you any good.
- You have a better idea?

25:04.720 --> 25:06.722
I'll see you in a little
under an hour. Be prompt.

25:08.811 --> 25:11.248
[intense music]

25:18.081 --> 25:19.561
[engine turns off]

25:22.956 --> 25:24.435
Jane, what's up?

25:24.523 --> 25:26.350
We're gonna try
to restore Pete's memory.

25:26.437 --> 25:28.222
Well, a piece of it,
at least.

25:30.790 --> 25:31.921
How could you do that?

25:32.008 --> 25:33.880
Ah, well, I'll explain.
But first..

25:33.967 --> 25:35.272
Oh, gracias, senor.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.407
- Taco?
- Sure, thanks.

25:39.494 --> 25:41.017
- Lisbon, you hungry?
- No, thank you.

25:41.104 --> 25:42.758
Okay.

25:42.845 --> 25:46.022
Uh, a memory can be brought back
by, uh, a word or an image

25:46.109 --> 25:49.069
but the best tools for digging
one out are the senses.

25:49.156 --> 25:52.551
Smell, hearing, taste.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.944
So I'm eating a taco because
I ate one the night Lucy died?

25:55.031 --> 25:56.511
That's right.
Taste is first.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.861
Second, coming from
the taco truck

25:58.948 --> 26:00.254
you would have
walked right by

26:00.341 --> 26:02.735
these beautifully
fragrant gardenias.

26:08.436 --> 26:11.308
Okay. I smell it,
but it's not doing anything.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.137
Then, right
before the murder

26:14.224 --> 26:17.314
you heard
a very distinctive sound.

26:17.401 --> 26:18.794
And you will hear it..

26:21.710 --> 26:23.190
- What sound?
- Wait for it.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.802
[church bell tolling]

26:30.850 --> 26:33.374
[intense music]

26:34.636 --> 26:36.290
- This is really--
- Shh.

26:39.206 --> 26:40.555
[Patrick]
'Pete?'

26:43.253 --> 26:44.515
I remember.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.215
[intense music]

26:52.611 --> 26:54.351
[church bell tolling]

26:54.438 --> 26:56.832
Don't force the memory.
Just, just let it come.

26:59.008 --> 27:00.967
I was here.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.578
[clattering]
Just walking.
I heard a sound.

27:05.841 --> 27:08.148
[church bell tolling]

27:10.150 --> 27:12.195
[gasping]

27:13.240 --> 27:15.851
[choking]

27:16.460 --> 27:17.548
Hey!

27:19.159 --> 27:20.682
I couldn't see anything.

27:20.769 --> 27:23.642
By the time my eyes adjusted,
the guy was gone.

27:23.729 --> 27:24.991
And Lucy..

27:27.558 --> 27:29.691
It's difficult, I know.

27:29.778 --> 27:31.388
It's very
important to continue.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.392
I tried to talk to her.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.830
Stay here. Stay here.
Stay with me.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.614
But her throat...
stay with me.

27:40.528 --> 27:43.139
[gasping]

27:43.226 --> 27:44.663
She just kept
squeezing my hand.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.317
[gasping]

27:48.754 --> 27:50.581
Do you remember anything
about her killer?

27:50.669 --> 27:53.367
His race? His height?
His clothing? Anything?

27:53.454 --> 27:56.500
- I can't talk right now.
- Pete, I need your attention.

27:56.587 --> 27:57.763
I need to write this down.

27:59.373 --> 28:00.679
So I don't forget.

28:02.550 --> 28:05.205
[intense music]

28:07.773 --> 28:09.470
It doesn't eliminate him
as a suspect.

28:09.557 --> 28:10.950
He could be lying.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.693
Fine. He's not a suspect.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.129
What else do we have?

28:16.216 --> 28:17.652
Well, Rigsby's got
Lucy's phone records.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.001
He's going through them.

28:19.088 --> 28:20.394
I think we should go
after Lewis.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.048
We don't have
anything on him.

28:22.135 --> 28:24.746
Well, he harassed Rose.
Maybe Lucy threatened him.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.922
Told him that she would have
the investigation reopened.

28:27.009 --> 28:28.881
Maybe.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.491
I agree with Cho.

28:30.578 --> 28:32.406
Man is begging
for some thumbscrews.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.063
You're seriously
asking me where I was

28:37.150 --> 28:38.804
when Corporal Greene
was killed?

28:38.891 --> 28:40.762
- Answer the question.
- Why?

28:40.849 --> 28:42.851
You were accused
of sexual harassment.

28:42.938 --> 28:45.071
Lucy Greene knew the victim.
That made her dangerous to you.

28:45.158 --> 28:46.942
No, it didn't.

28:47.029 --> 28:48.335
Are you refusing
to answer the question?

28:50.293 --> 28:52.208
The army,
in its infinite wisdom

28:52.295 --> 28:55.255
permits the anonymous reporting
of sexual harassment.

28:55.342 --> 28:57.257
'Which means any nut
or idiot with an attitude'

28:57.344 --> 28:59.433
can make trouble
free of charge.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.783
Some malcontent
made a wild accusation.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.829
'It was investigated,
nothing was found'

29:03.916 --> 29:06.179
there was no victim.
I didn't do anything.

29:06.266 --> 29:07.223
You still haven't told me
where you were

29:07.310 --> 29:09.399
when Lucy Greene
was killed.

29:09.486 --> 29:10.879
And we checked with
the front gate at the base.

29:10.966 --> 29:12.228
They said you left
in a hurry that day.

29:12.315 --> 29:14.056
I was late.

29:14.143 --> 29:16.929
Getting to a surprise party
for the base commander's wife.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.669
I was there
until after midnight.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.455
About 30 people
saw me there.

29:21.542 --> 29:22.935
'Do you have
any other questions?'

29:24.023 --> 29:26.503
[indistinct chattering]

29:27.940 --> 29:29.724
Base commander's XO.
Confirms Lewis

29:29.811 --> 29:31.334
was at his house
until midnight.

29:31.421 --> 29:32.596
'Couldn't have done it.'

29:32.683 --> 29:34.207
We're a little light
on suspects.

29:34.294 --> 29:35.556
I may have something.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.427
Telephone records say
Jacob Lettner

29:37.514 --> 29:39.995
made a bunch of phone calls to
Lucy the day she was murdered.

29:40.082 --> 29:41.040
Well, Lettner told me
he hadn't spoken

29:41.127 --> 29:42.476
to Lucy in almost a week.

29:42.563 --> 29:44.260
- We better bring him in.
- I'll go.

29:44.347 --> 29:45.914
- Someone I need to see.
- Okay.

29:49.788 --> 29:50.832
Hey!

29:52.573 --> 29:54.401
More questions, huh?

29:54.488 --> 29:56.359
Well, you got stamina.
I'll give you that.

29:56.446 --> 29:57.578
No questions.

29:59.362 --> 30:01.408
Your men were wrong
about Lucy.

30:01.495 --> 30:03.105
She didn't file
the sexual harassment charge.

30:03.192 --> 30:04.585
She was protecting
the person who did.

30:04.672 --> 30:06.500
Well, that's too bad.

30:06.587 --> 30:07.893
but it doesn't change
anything.

30:07.980 --> 30:11.331
It should.
Reopen the investigation.

30:11.418 --> 30:13.637
If you don't, you're letting
Lewis off the hook.

30:13.724 --> 30:16.379
Reopen the investigation?

30:16.466 --> 30:19.382
- Yeah, yeah, I'll do that.
- Why not?

30:19.469 --> 30:22.516
There's no evidence.
He's a lieutenant.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.474
Do you know how fast
he could have a foot up my ass?

30:25.649 --> 30:27.564
Alright.
I'm done here.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.523
Talk to rose.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.307
- Sutfin?
- Just talk to her.

30:31.394 --> 30:34.441
I already did. She said she
didn't know boo about Lewis.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.573
She was scared.
Tell her you'll protect her.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.749
It's not my job
to hold anybody's hand.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.403
You don't have to.
Just don't abandon her

30:40.490 --> 30:41.535
like you abandoned Lucy.

30:43.276 --> 30:45.669
I didn't abandon anybody.

30:45.756 --> 30:47.454
You keep
telling yourself that.

30:47.541 --> 30:49.282
But the next time you ask
someone in this unit

30:49.369 --> 30:51.850
to watch your back, he might
remember how you watched hers.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.548
[intense music]

30:56.419 --> 30:59.074
Jacob, tell us again about
the last time you saw Lucy.

30:59.161 --> 31:02.121
Like I, like I said, it was,
it was more than a week ago.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.774
We know that you spoke
to her on the phone

31:03.862 --> 31:06.560
several times a day
before she died.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.083
You're right.

31:08.170 --> 31:09.519
You're right.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

31:09.606 --> 31:10.956
No, you didn't.

31:12.348 --> 31:14.394
If you want to avoid
getting into trouble

31:14.481 --> 31:17.049
stop lying and tell us
the truth now.

31:17.136 --> 31:20.443
It was nothing. It was nothing.
It was about my meds.

31:20.530 --> 31:21.880
Well, what about them?

31:21.967 --> 31:23.838
I'm about to finish
the program.

31:23.925 --> 31:26.232
Move out on my own.

31:26.319 --> 31:28.408
But Lucy had to certify
that I was capable, you know

31:28.495 --> 31:29.931
that I could take care
of myself.

31:30.018 --> 31:33.935
- Keeping on top of your meds.
- Yeah.

31:34.022 --> 31:37.983
But that morning, Lucy told me
I'd messed up one of them

31:38.070 --> 31:40.028
taken too little,
and I hadn't.

31:40.115 --> 31:41.464
So I told her she made
a mistake

31:41.551 --> 31:43.423
which in Lucy's mind is..

31:43.510 --> 31:45.686
[chuckles]
...it's, like, impossible.

31:45.773 --> 31:47.122
Little miss detail.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.733
So we went a few rounds
on the phone

31:49.820 --> 31:50.909
but she finally agreed
to double-check

31:50.996 --> 31:53.041
the prescription records.

31:53.128 --> 31:55.348
Why didn't you tell us
about this earlier?

31:55.435 --> 31:57.045
Because if they think
I messed up my meds

31:57.132 --> 31:59.961
they won't let me live
on my own.

32:00.048 --> 32:02.790
It's wrong.

32:02.877 --> 32:05.184
Look, I'm,
I'm ready.

32:07.142 --> 32:08.317
I am.

32:13.279 --> 32:16.282
Rigsby just talked to
Jacob's boss at the PX.

32:16.369 --> 32:18.284
He was doing inventory
the night of the murder.

32:18.371 --> 32:19.807
This case is nothing
but dead ends.

32:19.894 --> 32:21.852
Yeah, not necessarily.
Do you have a padlock?

32:21.940 --> 32:23.985
- A padlock?
- Yeah. A lock with a key.

32:24.072 --> 32:26.379
I know what a padlock is, and
no, I do not have a padlock.

32:26.466 --> 32:27.684
Thank you.
I'll ask the janitor.

32:31.166 --> 32:32.254
[knock on door]

32:32.341 --> 32:33.560
Come in.

32:35.649 --> 32:37.433
- Hey.
- Mr. Jane. Is something wrong?

32:39.218 --> 32:41.785
Oh, no, I just had
something to do downstairs.

32:41.872 --> 32:44.005
So I thought I'd stop by.
They're nice drawings.

32:44.092 --> 32:46.007
[chuckles]
Oh, thanks.

32:46.094 --> 32:49.880
Wow. I know you have
trouble sleeping. I, uh..

32:49.968 --> 32:52.274
...I know a technique
that may be helpful.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.059
What kind of technique?

32:54.146 --> 32:58.106
Ah, it's just, uh,
mild hypnosis.

32:58.193 --> 33:00.456
- Just helps you relax.
- What do I have to do?

33:01.675 --> 33:02.981
Lie down and listen.

33:03.807 --> 33:04.983
Uh..

33:06.201 --> 33:07.986
...sure.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.770
Uh, I could really
use some sleep.

33:09.857 --> 33:11.598
[Patrick]
'Alright, well,
just lie down.'

33:11.685 --> 33:13.687
Okay.

33:13.774 --> 33:14.818
Close your eyes.

33:14.905 --> 33:16.646
[Pete exhales]

33:16.733 --> 33:20.563
[Patrick]
'Breathe. Fill your mind
with all those thoughts'

33:20.650 --> 33:22.522
that keep you awake.

33:22.609 --> 33:24.654
Let them crowd around
behind your eyes.

33:26.395 --> 33:28.919
Good. Now I want you
to paint them black.

33:30.530 --> 33:31.835
Each one of them.

33:33.315 --> 33:35.056
'Dark and heavy.'

33:36.014 --> 33:37.493
All the same color.

33:39.495 --> 33:41.149
Each one
is getting softer..

33:43.151 --> 33:44.370
...and heavier,
and quiet..

33:47.286 --> 33:49.897
...and peaceful,
and quiet..

33:53.031 --> 33:54.249
...and peaceful.

33:56.469 --> 33:59.124
[instrumental music]

34:12.311 --> 34:13.529
- You reach everyone?
- Yep.

34:13.616 --> 34:16.184
Good.

34:16.271 --> 34:19.796
Rigsby, we're a go
in five minutes.

34:19.883 --> 34:23.800
T-minus
five minutes. Yep.

34:32.113 --> 34:33.636
What's this about?

34:33.723 --> 34:35.203
Well, we learned of some
evidence this morning

34:35.290 --> 34:36.291
we need your help with.

34:36.378 --> 34:38.902
- Our help?
- What evidence?

34:38.989 --> 34:40.165
Why don't we have Pete tell us?
He's the one who found it.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.690
Hey, what's up, Pete?

34:43.777 --> 34:45.126
I remembered something
last night.

34:45.213 --> 34:46.693
I found it on my PDA
This morning.

34:46.780 --> 34:47.781
I must have woken up
in the middle of the night

34:47.868 --> 34:48.912
and written it down.

34:48.999 --> 34:52.002
- What did you remember?
- Um..

34:52.090 --> 34:54.179
When Lucy took my hand,
she gave me a key.

34:54.266 --> 34:55.702
A key?

34:55.789 --> 34:57.095
I guess that's why she was
grabbing my hands

34:57.182 --> 35:00.272
so I searched my room,
and I found..

35:00.359 --> 35:02.230
...this.

35:02.317 --> 35:03.797
- Can I see that?
- Yes, ma'am.

35:05.277 --> 35:07.540
Does this mean anything
to anybody?

35:07.627 --> 35:09.803
- No.
- Not me.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.761
It looks like a medic's
locker key

35:11.848 --> 35:14.242
but 107's
not Lucy's locker.

35:14.329 --> 35:17.419
Why would she have
another locker?

35:17.506 --> 35:18.812
Hide something.

35:18.899 --> 35:21.031
Well, maybe Lucy found
something incriminating

35:21.119 --> 35:22.859
decided to store it
in the locker

35:22.946 --> 35:24.252
and then she was killed
for it.

35:24.339 --> 35:25.514
That's why she gave
the key to Pete.

35:25.601 --> 35:27.951
Lewis, can we search
the locker?

35:28.038 --> 35:30.432
- Sure. With a warrant.
- Oh, come on.

35:30.519 --> 35:31.825
It's my duty to go
by the book.

35:31.912 --> 35:33.609
You need a warrant.

35:33.696 --> 35:35.263
It'll take me 20 minutes
to get one.

35:37.396 --> 35:38.571
Ah, Lewis.

35:39.354 --> 35:40.486
[chuckles]

35:40.573 --> 35:41.878
Such a stickler.

35:44.446 --> 35:47.101
[indistinct chattering]

35:53.977 --> 35:56.632
[alarm buzzing]

35:58.634 --> 35:59.896
[chuckles]

36:03.073 --> 36:05.902
It's just gonna be
a little while longer.

36:05.989 --> 36:08.209
[woman over PA]
'Code red in building 17D.'

36:08.296 --> 36:10.429
'Code red in building 17D.'

36:10.516 --> 36:12.909
All emergency personnel
respond immediately.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.781
That's me. Uh, sorry.

36:14.868 --> 36:16.957
Okay, well, thank you all
for your help.

36:17.044 --> 36:18.219
We'll let you know
what we find.

36:19.568 --> 36:21.875
[indistinct chattering]

36:24.356 --> 36:28.751
[woman on PA]
'Code red in building 17d.
Code red in building 17d.'

36:28.838 --> 36:31.276
'All emergency personnel
respond immediately.'

36:32.668 --> 36:35.280
[intense music]

36:46.856 --> 36:49.729
[music continues]

37:04.265 --> 37:06.267
Hey, doc.
What are you doin'?

37:07.660 --> 37:10.967
Uh. I, uh, um..

37:11.054 --> 37:13.143
[Patrick imitating]
"Eh, uh, uh.."

37:13.231 --> 37:15.058
You're a silver-tongued
devil.

37:17.887 --> 37:19.280
[sighs]

37:19.367 --> 37:20.934
We found
a significant number

37:21.021 --> 37:24.285
of cash deposits
in your account.

37:24.372 --> 37:25.982
You were writing
fake prescriptions

37:26.069 --> 37:29.029
and selling the drugs
under the table for cash.

37:29.116 --> 37:30.726
That's what Lucy found
when she looked into

37:30.813 --> 37:32.511
Jacob's prescription records.

37:32.598 --> 37:35.644
- Are you divorced, agent?
- No.

37:35.731 --> 37:39.082
You have no idea
how expensive it is.

37:39.169 --> 37:43.435
I'm paying legal fees,
alimony, child support..

37:43.522 --> 37:46.002
...and all so the lying bitch
can be supported

37:46.089 --> 37:48.091
in the manner to which
she's accustomed.

37:48.178 --> 37:50.355
What about the manner
to which I'maccustomed?

37:50.442 --> 37:53.096
What about mylifestyle?

37:53.183 --> 37:54.750
And dating isn't cheap.

37:54.837 --> 37:56.099
Really?

37:59.886 --> 38:01.279
Lucy came to me.

38:02.715 --> 38:05.021
[exhales]
The diligent fool.

38:05.108 --> 38:06.762
Said she found some
serious problems

38:06.849 --> 38:08.982
with the prescriptions.

38:09.069 --> 38:11.550
No idea I was behind it,
but..

38:11.637 --> 38:14.683
...she's all gung ho
to launch a big investigation.

38:16.076 --> 38:17.338
That's how she was.

38:20.776 --> 38:23.692
[rattling]

38:23.779 --> 38:25.955
She said she was going
to the blues club that night

38:26.042 --> 38:29.002
so, I waited
down the street.

38:34.007 --> 38:36.052
Lucy?

38:36.139 --> 38:37.271
- Doctor?
- Yeah.

38:37.358 --> 38:38.577
What are you doing here?

38:38.664 --> 38:40.666
Uh, there's a man
hurt back here.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.189
Come and help me.

38:42.276 --> 38:43.321
Uh, okay. Sure.

38:45.018 --> 38:47.629
Only took a second.

38:47.716 --> 38:48.935
[grunts]

38:52.591 --> 38:55.550
[choking]

38:55.637 --> 38:57.465
Takes about a minute
to bleed to death

38:57.552 --> 38:58.684
so I waited.

38:59.641 --> 39:02.252
[gasping]

39:02.340 --> 39:06.082
Hey!

39:06.169 --> 39:07.257
Lucy!

39:08.520 --> 39:10.260
This is not my fault.

39:10.348 --> 39:13.046
If my ex-wife had just agreed
to a reasonable settlement

39:13.133 --> 39:15.004
none of this
would have happened.

39:15.091 --> 39:16.310
Hmm. Oh, well..

39:17.485 --> 39:19.269
Look on the the bright side.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.533
In prison, you won't
have to pay for dates.

39:33.501 --> 39:35.242
What are you doing here?

39:35.329 --> 39:37.418
- Just watching.
- Excuse me?

39:39.289 --> 39:40.465
Lieutenant Lewis.

39:45.034 --> 39:46.427
I need to speak with you.

39:46.514 --> 39:48.168
Later, Sergeant Hawkins.
I'm busy.

39:48.255 --> 39:51.301
No, sir.
We need to do this asap.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.173
It's regarding
a code violation.

39:53.260 --> 39:55.305
[door opens]

39:58.004 --> 40:00.049
Are you serious?

40:00.136 --> 40:01.486
[Hawkins]
'Sir, we have to go now.'

40:02.748 --> 40:05.403
[intense music]

40:06.273 --> 40:07.405
Hawkins.

40:11.191 --> 40:13.976
[music continues]

40:28.730 --> 40:30.993
I got your message,
Mr. Jane, Oh..

40:31.080 --> 40:32.386
[exhales]
I'm sorry.

40:32.473 --> 40:34.780
No, it's good.
Uh, good.

40:37.391 --> 40:40.873
Pete, thank you
for coming by.

40:40.960 --> 40:44.050
Uh, I just, I wanted
to, uh, apologize

40:44.137 --> 40:45.530
for tricking you
without asking.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.229
The gag wouldn't have
worked without it. Sorry.

40:51.492 --> 40:53.059
You got the guy
who killed Lucy.

40:53.146 --> 40:54.364
That's good enough for me.

40:57.106 --> 40:59.152
Uh, I'm actually here

40:59.239 --> 41:01.023
about that other thing.

41:02.982 --> 41:04.940
Do you really think you could
help restore my memory?

41:07.682 --> 41:11.294
Well, I, I do have a tool
that could be very useful.

41:11.381 --> 41:13.035
- Have a seat.
- Alright.

41:15.385 --> 41:16.865
[clears throat]

41:18.388 --> 41:20.260
It's called
a memory palace.

41:20.347 --> 41:23.698
It's basically a place
to connect memories to.

41:23.785 --> 41:26.179
You said I would need the image
of a place I knew really well.

41:26.266 --> 41:28.224
- Yes, that's right.
- I think I got one.

41:30.575 --> 41:34.753
Uh, these are my buddies
from Khost.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.842
This picture
was taken in our tent

41:38.234 --> 41:39.540
about two weeks before.

41:41.586 --> 41:43.805
'I spent..'

41:43.892 --> 41:45.938
[voice breaking]
I spent 14 months

41:46.025 --> 41:48.244
in that tent
with those guys.

41:52.248 --> 41:54.512
I know every inch of it.

41:54.599 --> 41:56.296
Good.

41:56.383 --> 41:57.819
Who was the first
person you saw

41:57.906 --> 41:59.299
when you woke up
in the morning?

42:01.736 --> 42:03.608
Um, Ford.

42:04.609 --> 42:05.740
Uh, Danny Ford.

42:07.307 --> 42:10.049
Lazy bastard's
always sleeping in.

42:10.136 --> 42:11.572
He could sleep right
through a firefight.

42:13.052 --> 42:15.663
Okay. Here's how it works.

42:15.750 --> 42:17.230
Well, let's say
you need to remember

42:17.317 --> 42:20.407
a dentist's appointment,
Monday, 10:00 AM.

42:20.494 --> 42:24.846
I want you to imagine
seeing Danny

42:24.933 --> 42:26.718
holding something
ridiculous

42:26.805 --> 42:29.329
that makes you think
of a dentist.

42:29.416 --> 42:31.244
