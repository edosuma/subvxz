00:05.838 --> 00:08.372
Welcome back to <i>tool time.</i>

00:08.373 --> 00:12.677
Ooh, spring is in the air,
isn't it?

00:12.678 --> 00:17.248
<i>(inhales)</i> birds are chirpin',
flowers are growin',

00:17.249 --> 00:18.783
Bees are buzzin'.

00:18.784 --> 00:20.785
<i>(fly buzzing)</i>

00:28.894 --> 00:31.830
Your wife
is whispering something
soft in your ear, like,

00:31.831 --> 00:36.467
"hey, you big ape,
get up off that couch
and paint the house!"

00:36.468 --> 00:39.470
I'm not shutting any game off
until I can paint the house
a man's way.

00:39.471 --> 00:41.940
That'd be using
a compressor. Oh, yeah.

00:41.941 --> 00:44.275
That's right,
but before you spray,

00:44.276 --> 00:46.011
You wanna prepare your surface.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.411
That's right, al,
and that's why today,

00:47.412 --> 00:49.447
Al and I will be doing
our <i>tool time</i> salute...

00:49.448 --> 00:50.615
<i>(velcro rips)</i>

00:50.616 --> 00:52.017
...To stripping.

00:59.625 --> 01:01.492
Excuse me, al.

02:23.943 --> 02:25.977
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

02:38.857 --> 02:41.892
Tim, that's
the last pretzel.

02:41.893 --> 02:44.795
Can you break it in half?

02:45.864 --> 02:48.399
Thanks.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.668
I was thinking about you.

02:50.669 --> 02:53.071
You know how salt
makes you retain water, buddy.

03:01.713 --> 03:05.116
I think that woman
recognizes me from the show.

03:05.117 --> 03:09.587
Sit down, sit down.
I know who that is.
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

03:09.588 --> 03:12.623
It's stacey lewis. I dated her
all through high school.

03:12.624 --> 03:15.793
No kidding?
Don't look around.

03:15.794 --> 03:19.464
I don't want her
coming over here. I dumped her,
like, 20 years ago.

03:19.465 --> 03:20.698
So?

03:20.699 --> 03:23.034
So I don't think
I ever called to tell her.

03:24.103 --> 03:26.070
Well,
that wasn't very nice.

03:26.071 --> 03:28.039
I was 18. I was immature
back then.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.175
I couldn't face things.
Let's sneak out of here.

03:31.176 --> 03:32.543
Tim.

03:32.544 --> 03:34.545
It's about 3:30.

03:34.546 --> 03:38.516
Tim. Tim, it's me -
stacey lewis.

03:38.517 --> 03:40.118
Stacey lewis.
Hey, you look great.

03:40.119 --> 03:43.321
I haven't spoken to you
since high school.

03:43.322 --> 03:45.556
Has it been that long?

03:45.557 --> 03:47.425
Stacey lewis, al borland.

03:47.426 --> 03:48.626
Hi. Al borland.

03:48.627 --> 03:50.194
Hi.

03:50.195 --> 03:54.165
So, tim, gosh,
what have you been up to?

03:54.166 --> 03:57.035
Uh, I have a tool show
on cable - <i>tool time.</i>

03:57.036 --> 04:00.738
Timmy taylor
has a tool show.

04:00.739 --> 04:04.342
But you were the guy who
blew out all the windows
in shop.

04:04.343 --> 04:07.445
He does that for a living now.

04:11.517 --> 04:13.851
Would you like
to join us?

04:13.852 --> 04:16.154
Um, yeah, just
for a second, sure.

04:16.154 --> 04:17.855
Great.

04:20.091 --> 04:24.028
So, stacey,
what have you been doing
all these years? What's up?

04:24.029 --> 04:26.464
Well, I'm an attorney.
Hey.

04:26.465 --> 04:29.600
I have a practice in ann arbor,
but I'm moving back to detroit.

04:29.601 --> 04:32.570
Great, great.
Did you get married?

04:32.571 --> 04:36.474
As a matter of fact,
I married a guy who had
a lot of your qualities.

04:36.475 --> 04:37.908
Lucky girl.

04:37.909 --> 04:40.945
The divorce was final
last Thursday.

04:40.946 --> 04:43.948
How about you?
Did you ever get married?

04:43.949 --> 04:47.518
Yes, yes, I've been married
14 unforgettable years.
15.

04:47.519 --> 04:49.620
15.

04:49.621 --> 04:51.522
Jill is
a terrific woman.

04:51.523 --> 04:56.360
Do you know that
tim and I were quite the item
until he went off to college?

04:56.361 --> 04:59.897
Then I heard he started
dating some bimbo.

04:59.898 --> 05:02.300
That would be jill.

05:03.368 --> 05:05.169
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.071
Oh, it's ok.

05:07.072 --> 05:10.841
You know, someday I would
love to meet the woman
who stole you away from me.

05:10.842 --> 05:13.111
Now, there's a good idea.

05:24.723 --> 05:27.158
Uh, stacey lewis.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.595
Tim taylor.

05:32.164 --> 05:33.864
Al borland.

05:39.804 --> 05:41.772
Gee, I gotta get going.

05:41.773 --> 05:43.807
I have to meet
a real-estate broker.

05:43.808 --> 05:45.709
I'm looking at a house
over in edgewood.

05:45.710 --> 05:46.877
Edgewood?
Edgewood?

05:46.878 --> 05:48.879
That's right where
tim lives now.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.382
Maybe you could
get together afterwards.

05:51.383 --> 05:55.719
Ooh, I would love to,
but I'm pressed for time.

05:55.720 --> 05:59.757
Aw, shucks. 'cause I'm sure jill
would've loved to have met ya.

05:59.758 --> 06:01.058
Oh.

06:01.059 --> 06:03.294
Well, maybe you could
just stop by for a minute.

06:03.295 --> 06:06.197
She said she was busy,
didn't she, al?

06:06.198 --> 06:10.501
Yeah, I am, but, al,
pleasure meeting you.

06:10.502 --> 06:11.702
Same here.

06:11.703 --> 06:14.172
Stace, it really was
good to see you.

06:14.173 --> 06:16.407
It was great
running into you, tim.

06:16.408 --> 06:17.608
Good luck finding a house.

06:17.609 --> 06:19.277
Thanks. Take care.
You too.

06:20.345 --> 06:21.779
Bye.

06:24.983 --> 06:28.386
So, the old girlfriend.

06:28.387 --> 06:31.556
What the hell's
the matter with you?

06:31.557 --> 06:32.756
What?

06:32.757 --> 06:34.792
I don't want jill meeting her.
Why not?

06:34.793 --> 06:37.261
In college, jill wouldn't
get serious with me

06:37.262 --> 06:39.029
Until I ended my relationship
with stacey.

06:39.030 --> 06:41.666
I didn't know how to tell her,
so I didn't call her,

06:41.667 --> 06:43.701
But I told jill
that I did call her.

06:43.702 --> 06:45.769
That was a fib, tim.

06:45.770 --> 06:48.706
Al, that was a big, fat lie.

06:48.707 --> 06:51.209
Why did you tell stacey
jill would love to meet her?

06:51.210 --> 06:53.844
Because I'm being polite.
People say things
they don't mean all the time.

06:53.845 --> 06:56.347
I'm sorry. Next time,
I'll stay out of it.
Why don't ya?

06:56.348 --> 06:58.349
Well, here,
let me get this.

06:58.350 --> 07:00.784
Oh, picking up
the check, huh?

07:00.785 --> 07:02.753
No, I was just
being polite.

07:08.193 --> 07:09.627
Hi, honey.

07:09.628 --> 07:11.696
Oh, hi. Would you
come over here and help me?

07:11.697 --> 07:15.466
I've gotta get a few more
of these balloons blown up
for the cub scout banquet.

07:15.467 --> 07:16.900
Oh, ok.

07:18.870 --> 07:20.538
How was your day?

07:20.539 --> 07:22.273
Oh, great, great day today.

07:22.274 --> 07:25.643
Yeah? Nothing unusual
happened?
No.

07:25.644 --> 07:29.347
Didn't run into
an old girlfriend, perhaps?

07:29.348 --> 07:30.914
<i>(balloon squeaks)</i>

07:33.752 --> 07:36.420
That blabbermouth borland
was on the phone, wasn't he?

07:36.421 --> 07:39.523
No. Stacey lewis
called here.

07:39.524 --> 07:42.560
She said that she'd like to
take you up on your offer.

07:42.561 --> 07:44.362
<i>(releases helium)</i>

07:44.363 --> 07:45.996
<i>(voice</i>
<i>goes up a couple octaves)</i>
I didn't give her any offer.

07:45.997 --> 07:48.932
What kind of offer? I did not
give her any offers. Ahem.

07:52.337 --> 07:56.206
She was in the area.
I asked her to drop by.

07:56.207 --> 07:57.742
You don't wanna meet her.

07:57.743 --> 08:00.645
Oh, yes, I would love to meet
the famous stacey lewis,

08:00.646 --> 08:03.481
The love of your
high-school life.

08:03.482 --> 08:05.416
Is she, uh, pretty?

08:05.417 --> 08:08.886
Come on, how pretty can she be?
She's almost your age.

08:10.489 --> 08:12.623
<i>(sarcastic laugh)</i>

08:12.624 --> 08:14.692
Hey, mom, we found
dad's yearbook.

08:14.693 --> 08:17.828
Oh, good. Lemme see.
Lemme see. Where is she?

08:17.829 --> 08:19.997
Stacey lewis is a babe.

08:19.998 --> 08:22.032
Yeah, she's skinny, mom.

08:22.033 --> 08:25.068
Everybody's skinny
when they're 17.

08:25.069 --> 08:27.938
Look what she wrote to dad.
Where is it?

08:27.939 --> 08:34.745
"you've made
senior year heavenly.
You are the grooviest.

08:34.746 --> 08:38.881
You'll always be
my love muffin."

08:38.883 --> 08:40.884
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

08:42.554 --> 08:45.022
All right,
dad's other chick.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.693
Go answer the door,
love muffin.

08:50.329 --> 08:52.896
You better watch it, or maybe
next time jennifer comes over,

08:52.897 --> 08:56.133
I'll show her that
little baby picture of you
standing up in the bathtub.

09:00.605 --> 09:02.606
Stace, come on in,
come on in.

09:02.607 --> 09:04.542
Welcome to the house.
Let me take your coat here.

09:04.543 --> 09:06.210
All right, boys,
front and center.

09:06.211 --> 09:08.579
I want you to meet
an old friend of mine.

09:08.580 --> 09:11.014
These are my boys.
That's mark, randy and brad.

09:11.015 --> 09:13.283
<i>(all)</i> hi.
Hi.

09:13.284 --> 09:15.786
And here's jill taylor,
my lovely, beautiful,
talented wife of 14 years.

09:15.787 --> 09:17.488
15.
15 years.

09:18.757 --> 09:20.257
Nice to meet you.

09:20.258 --> 09:21.459
A pleasure.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.694
Did you ever kiss my dad?

09:23.695 --> 09:26.464
I don't really think that's
any of your business, is it?

09:26.465 --> 09:28.366
Hey, why don't we
go outside and play?

09:28.367 --> 09:29.467
Oh, come on, dad.

09:29.468 --> 09:31.502
Hey, come on. Now.
Hide and seek.

09:31.503 --> 09:33.036
And don't
look for each other.

09:34.105 --> 09:36.540
Great-looking kids.

09:36.541 --> 09:38.642
They must get that
from you, jill.

09:38.643 --> 09:41.612
Oh, they do,
thank you, thank you.

09:41.613 --> 09:45.249
So... Jill.

09:47.252 --> 09:49.086
Stacey.

09:50.589 --> 09:52.390
Tim.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.926
Would you
like a drink?

09:55.927 --> 09:58.362
A club soda would be great.

09:58.363 --> 10:01.064
<i>(mark)</i> dad, help!

10:01.065 --> 10:03.868
I should go check and see if
he's getting hurt out there.

10:03.869 --> 10:06.771
That's good, it'll give us
a chance to talk about you
behind your back.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.939
Oh, he's all right,
he's all right.

10:10.008 --> 10:12.710
Does it all the time.
Dad, help!

10:12.711 --> 10:14.578
Would you go out there?

10:14.579 --> 10:18.949
Help! Help!
What?

10:18.950 --> 10:20.451
Help!

10:20.452 --> 10:23.220
Ok, I can't even guess.
Why are you sitting on him?

10:23.221 --> 10:25.756
The lawn chair was wet.

10:25.757 --> 10:30.828
Come on. Come on. Just don't
let him sit on you next time.

10:30.829 --> 10:32.129
Brad, you're a poophead.

10:32.130 --> 10:34.565
Stop, stop. Hey, hey!

10:34.566 --> 10:38.702
Hey, dad,
mom and your girlfriend
are talking on the couch.

10:38.703 --> 10:41.071
She's not my girlfriend.

10:41.072 --> 10:44.708
Yeah, whatever you say,
love muffin.

10:44.709 --> 10:47.845
Get away from the window.
That's not prop - get a -

10:51.115 --> 10:53.050
Boy, there's something
you don't wanna see -

10:53.051 --> 10:55.185
Your ex-girlfriend and wife
getting friendly.

10:55.186 --> 10:56.821
And why is that?

10:56.822 --> 10:59.457
They'll
start exchanging stories,
making up stupid stuff about me.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.459
You think that's what
they're doing now?

11:01.460 --> 11:02.827
I think I'm in the clear.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.795
I think it's just
a little small talk.

11:04.796 --> 11:07.465
If they were telling
embarrassing stories,
they'd be laughing.

11:23.682 --> 11:26.350
Hey, what's so funny?

11:26.351 --> 11:29.520
Oh, no, we were just
talking about you.

11:29.521 --> 11:32.022
Excuse me.
You're excused.

11:32.023 --> 11:34.057
Now, stacey, I want you
to tell me something.

11:34.058 --> 11:37.427
Back then, when he walked by
a hardware store,

11:37.428 --> 11:40.598
Did he make unusual noises?

11:40.599 --> 11:44.468
You mean like, "ooh-ooh"?

11:44.469 --> 11:45.636
That's the one.

11:45.637 --> 11:47.437
You mean he hasn't
outgrown that yet?

11:47.438 --> 11:49.373
<i>(grunts)</i> no, no, no.

11:51.776 --> 11:53.844
Stacey, I gotta tell you,

11:53.845 --> 11:56.981
I have always felt so awkward
about what happened

11:56.982 --> 11:58.983
All those years ago
with you and tim -

11:58.984 --> 12:00.784
Honey, come on.
This is water under the bridge.

12:00.785 --> 12:02.820
Water under the bridge,
down the river,

12:02.821 --> 12:06.790
Through the village,
past the treatment plant,
out to sea.

12:06.791 --> 12:08.826
Well, it wouldn't
have been so bad

12:08.827 --> 12:10.761
If I had just known
it was over.

12:10.762 --> 12:12.897
Oh, boy.

12:12.898 --> 12:17.568
Wait a minute. He told me that
he told you that he called you
and told you that it was over.

12:17.569 --> 12:20.638
Why are we dragging up
all these old memories?

12:20.639 --> 12:22.372
No, he never called.

12:22.373 --> 12:24.374
You never called her?

12:24.375 --> 12:26.343
I thought you were
better than that.

12:26.344 --> 12:28.012
I'm not.

12:29.147 --> 12:30.981
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

12:30.982 --> 12:33.350
I'll get it.

12:33.351 --> 12:35.519

I should be going, too.
I gotta meet that realtor.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.988
Wait. Can't you stay
a little bit longer?
She's gotta go, honey.

12:40.458 --> 12:41.625
Hey, al.
Hi, tim.

12:41.626 --> 12:42.993
Come on in.
Hi, al.

12:42.994 --> 12:45.796
Well, I was just -
hi. Hi, jill.

12:45.797 --> 12:48.198
I was just stopping by
to pick up my helium tank.

12:48.199 --> 12:49.499
Oh, hi.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.701
Stacey, right.
Right.

12:50.702 --> 12:52.903
Al borland, tim's friend.
Yes.

12:52.904 --> 12:54.972
Yeah, we met this afternoon.
We were in the bar.

12:54.973 --> 12:57.608
Right. I remember.

12:57.609 --> 13:00.077
So did you get a chance
to take a look at that house?

13:00.078 --> 13:02.546
As a matter of fact,
I was just on my way there now.

13:02.547 --> 13:04.949
Um, 5621 palmer avenue.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.885
Oh, right.
She must be looking at
that two-story craftsman.

13:07.886 --> 13:10.287
You know, you'll wanna
check the foundation,

13:10.288 --> 13:12.957
Make sure that
there's not any cracks
in the mortar joints.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.859
Al knows everything
there is to know
about construction.

13:15.860 --> 13:17.695
Gee, maybe I should
go with you.

13:17.696 --> 13:19.930
Al, you're a busy guy.
No, I'm not.

13:19.931 --> 13:22.900
Stacey's a busy woman.
No, I'm not.

13:22.901 --> 13:26.269
Uh, gosh, I could
use your help.
Great.

13:26.270 --> 13:31.642
Jill, gosh, it was a pleasure
to finally meet you.

13:31.643 --> 13:33.944
Well, it was nice to meet you,
too. I hope you like this house.

13:33.945 --> 13:35.245
Yeah, I hope so, too.

13:35.246 --> 13:37.414
Tim...
Thanks for stopping by, stace.

13:37.415 --> 13:39.549
Good seeing ya.
Gimme a call sometime.

13:39.550 --> 13:43.687
Oops, I forgot
who I was talking to.

13:43.688 --> 13:45.055
<i>(jill laughs)</i>

13:45.056 --> 13:47.024
Later.
Bye.

13:50.795 --> 13:52.963
I should've known.
What?

13:52.964 --> 13:54.564
I should've known that
you would never call her.

13:54.565 --> 13:56.566
What is it with you men?

13:56.567 --> 13:58.769
You can't make
a simple phone call
to end a relationship.

13:58.770 --> 14:01.805
If it had been
a simple phone call,
I probably would've made it.

14:01.806 --> 14:05.442
"hey, stacey, yeah, it's tim.
It's over. Bye-bye."

14:07.178 --> 14:09.279
You just don't understand.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.415
You cannot leave women dangling.
We need closure.

14:12.416 --> 14:15.519
No, you want
to beat it to death
is what you want to do.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.621
<i>(feminine voice)</i>
"yeah, mm-hmm, ok, tim.

14:17.622 --> 14:19.823
"ok, it's over, I accept that.
Mm-hmm, yeah.

14:19.824 --> 14:22.225
"but I think we should
get together and talk about it.

14:22.226 --> 14:25.729
"uh-huh. Minute by minute,
detail by detail,

14:25.730 --> 14:29.833
"broken promise
by broken promise!

14:29.834 --> 14:32.670
"maybe I'll bring my lawyer,
my accountant, my father,

14:32.671 --> 14:34.371
"the minister
and maybe the gym teacher!

14:34.372 --> 14:38.008
I hate you! You..."

14:40.045 --> 14:41.478
Morning, wilson.

14:41.479 --> 14:42.946
Hi-ho, tim.

14:42.947 --> 14:45.015
I got a problem.

14:45.016 --> 14:47.084
No kidding.

14:48.853 --> 14:51.088
Jill met my girlfriend.

14:51.089 --> 14:54.558
Well, I can't say
that I approve of that.

14:54.559 --> 14:57.027
No, my old
high-school girlfriend.

14:57.028 --> 14:58.762
Oh.

14:58.763 --> 15:03.600
She's kind of annoyed
about something I didn't do
20 years ago.

15:03.601 --> 15:05.736
<i>(chuckles)</i> a sin of omission.

15:05.737 --> 15:07.571
No, it wasn't that bad.

15:07.572 --> 15:10.874
When I broke up with this girl,
I never called to tell her.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.910
Mm. So you lied to her.

15:12.911 --> 15:14.712
No.

15:14.713 --> 15:17.981
Well, according to
robert louis stevenson,
you did.

15:17.982 --> 15:22.019
He said the cruelest lies
are often told in silence.

15:22.020 --> 15:26.289
Hmm. But didn't calvin coolidge
say nothing he never said

15:26.290 --> 15:28.325
Ever did him any harm?

15:28.326 --> 15:30.393
Very good.

15:33.397 --> 15:38.468
Thomas mann once said,
"a harmful truth is better
than a useful lie."

15:38.469 --> 15:41.671
Not bad. But wait, wait, wait.

15:41.672 --> 15:47.211
Turkish proverbs was,
"he who tells the truth will
be chased out of nine villages."

15:47.212 --> 15:48.578
Excellent.

15:50.715 --> 15:53.550
But I believe the final word
would be heyward broun,

15:53.551 --> 15:57.121
"for truth,
there is no deadline."

15:57.122 --> 15:59.556
Oh, that's three to two.
You beat me, wilson.

16:01.226 --> 16:04.194
So why didn't you
call the girl, tim?

16:04.195 --> 16:07.530
I was afraid
that if I called her, she'd
start crying, and I'd feel bad.

16:07.531 --> 16:11.601
Well, sometimes, tim,
when a relationship ends
and a person cries,

16:11.602 --> 16:14.738
They aren't just
tears of sorrow,
but of liberation.

16:14.739 --> 16:16.740
A woman needs closure.

16:16.741 --> 16:18.075
Exactly.

16:18.076 --> 16:19.609
Jill said that yesterday.

16:19.610 --> 16:20.610
Smart woman.

16:20.611 --> 16:23.213
Yeah, she is a bright woman.

16:23.214 --> 16:26.216
That's fantastic.
Wait, hold on a second.

16:26.217 --> 16:31.054
This is stacey. Al wants
to have lunch with her.

16:31.055 --> 16:34.357
Hey, listen,
why don't we double?
We could do it today.

16:34.358 --> 16:36.894
No, no. Me and tim,
you and al.

16:36.895 --> 16:39.930
No, tim loves the idea.
He'll love it.

16:39.931 --> 16:45.202
I'll have tim talk to al, and
we'll all meet at big mike's?

16:45.203 --> 16:47.671
Yeah. What time
is good for you?

16:47.672 --> 16:48.939
Never.

16:48.940 --> 16:52.075
1:00 is fine.

16:52.076 --> 16:55.545
That's great. Ok.
All right, bye.

16:55.546 --> 16:58.215
Why did you do that?

16:58.216 --> 17:00.083
'cause I love
to get people together.

17:00.084 --> 17:02.719
Stacey said that after they
went to look at the house,
they had drinks.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.655
She was captivated by al.

17:05.656 --> 17:08.291
How many drinks
did she have?

17:10.594 --> 17:13.696
Stacey and al
going out together.

17:13.698 --> 17:17.367
Al's gonna get
some pretty juicy tidbits
about you.

17:17.367 --> 17:20.838
They're
not right for each other.
What do they have in common?

17:20.839 --> 17:23.106
Well, they both
don't like you.

17:26.877 --> 17:28.244
Hey, you're late.

17:28.246 --> 17:31.815
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
I just lost all track of time.

17:31.816 --> 17:35.018
Bob vila was doing
a one-hour special on glue guns.

17:35.019 --> 17:37.620
At least you have
a good excuse.

17:37.621 --> 17:40.457
I'll make it up. I'll only take
a half-hour for lunch.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.292
You and I are going to lunch.
Great.

17:42.293 --> 17:44.361
With jill and stacey, huh?

17:44.362 --> 17:46.964
Stacey's going to lunch?
Yeah.

17:46.965 --> 17:48.966
Uh, well, no,
I can't make that.

17:48.967 --> 17:51.101
You told her you were
gonna have lunch with her.

17:51.102 --> 17:53.503
Well, I was being polite.

17:53.504 --> 17:57.207
Al, she's a terrific gal.

17:57.208 --> 17:58.608
She's not my type.

17:58.609 --> 18:00.878
Not your type. She's alive.

18:03.481 --> 18:06.850
Well, she's a very nice woman,

18:06.851 --> 18:10.720
But when
I was with her last night,
there wasn't any chemistry.

18:10.721 --> 18:13.290
It was like
being with my sister.

18:13.291 --> 18:17.427
Not good.
I've seen your sister.

18:17.428 --> 18:21.131
Listen, I'll just
keep setting up, and you go.

18:21.132 --> 18:23.000
Just tell her that I'm busy.

18:23.001 --> 18:24.467
No, no, no.

18:24.468 --> 18:27.204
You're gonna tell her
you're not having lunch
with her.

18:27.205 --> 18:29.306
No, I don't - what am I
supposed to tell her?

18:29.307 --> 18:32.409
I mean, am I supposed to say,
"stacey, when I'm with you,

18:32.410 --> 18:34.912
I don't hear any violins
and accordions"?

18:34.913 --> 18:36.346
You tell her whatever -

18:39.717 --> 18:41.851
Accordions?

18:41.852 --> 18:45.522
In some countries,
it's considered
the instrument of love.

18:45.523 --> 18:47.524
Stacey needs some closure.

18:47.525 --> 18:49.526
You gotta end
this relationship.

18:49.527 --> 18:52.930
What relationship? It's not like
we've been dating for two years.

18:52.931 --> 18:55.598
I was with her
for a couple of hours.

18:55.599 --> 18:58.035
Al, a couple of hours
with you

18:58.036 --> 19:00.203
Is like a couple of years
to most people.

19:00.204 --> 19:01.871
You gotta go down there
with me.

19:01.872 --> 19:04.674
No, I don't want to.
You've got to go with me.

19:04.675 --> 19:06.676
I don't want to,
and you can't make me!

19:06.677 --> 19:10.113
I'm not gonna go down there
and lie for you, al. Arr!

19:12.616 --> 19:14.051
Hi, guys.
Oh, hi, tim.

19:14.052 --> 19:16.053
Hi, sweetie.

19:16.054 --> 19:17.220
Where's al?

19:17.221 --> 19:19.456
Al?
Yeah.

19:19.457 --> 19:22.292
He didn't want to...

19:24.062 --> 19:27.297
...To leave the show
without setting up.

19:27.298 --> 19:30.633
Oh. So he's not coming?

19:30.634 --> 19:31.734
No.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.903
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah.

19:33.904 --> 19:35.939
Ok, let's eat. I'm having
those chili fries.

19:35.940 --> 19:38.175
Not unless you wanna
sleep downstairs.

19:38.176 --> 19:42.479
This is so cool.
Who would've thought that you
would visit your ex-boyfriend

19:42.480 --> 19:46.316
And meet his friend
and actually really like him?

19:46.317 --> 19:48.218
He's so attractive.

19:48.219 --> 19:49.987
I don't know. I hope
I hear from him.

19:49.988 --> 19:52.456
Oh, I think he's gonna call you.
Don't you think so, tim?

19:52.457 --> 19:54.657
He'll call.

19:54.658 --> 19:58.228
I could tell
that he really liked you
when he was at the house.

19:58.229 --> 19:59.762
Don't you think so, tim?

19:59.763 --> 20:02.065
He had feelings.

20:02.066 --> 20:03.300
Al, al.

20:03.301 --> 20:05.635
Oh, hi. Hi.

20:05.636 --> 20:08.038
Stacey, gee...
Hi.

20:08.039 --> 20:10.673
I'm sorry. I should never have
put tim in the awkward position.

20:10.674 --> 20:11.674
It's ok, al.

20:11.675 --> 20:13.710
No, it was wrong,
and I feel bad.

20:13.711 --> 20:17.114
If I didn't wanna go out
with you, I should've been
man enough to tell you

20:17.115 --> 20:20.150
And not have tim
tell you that.

20:22.020 --> 20:24.287
Guess I can have those
chili fries now, huh?

20:27.791 --> 20:29.493
You didn't tell her?

20:29.494 --> 20:31.361
Look, al, it's no big deal.

20:31.362 --> 20:34.531
If you're not interested,
you're not interested.

20:34.532 --> 20:38.035
I'm sorry.

20:38.036 --> 20:40.337
Yeah, me, too.

20:40.338 --> 20:43.640
Glad that you understand.

20:43.641 --> 20:46.043
Oh, this is
kind of awkward.

20:46.044 --> 20:49.413
Oh, please, we're all adults.
Let's just all sit down
and have lunch,

20:49.414 --> 20:52.949
You know, al, you, me,
and the big fat liar.

20:52.950 --> 20:56.453
You know, tim,
you haven't changed a bit.

20:56.454 --> 20:58.422
Why didn't you
just tell me the truth?

20:58.423 --> 21:00.424
This wasn't my closure.
This was al's closure.

21:00.425 --> 21:03.260
What are you
talking about? We went out for
a couple of drinks last night.

21:03.261 --> 21:04.861
That's exactly
what I was telling him.

21:04.862 --> 21:07.564
Let's go get
some more drinks.
Ok.

21:10.868 --> 21:12.735
You are pathetic.

21:12.736 --> 21:14.171
Pathetic, pathetic, pathetic.

21:14.172 --> 21:15.205
What am I?

21:15.206 --> 21:17.407
Pathetic.

21:17.408 --> 21:20.077
None of this would have happened
if you'd called her 20 years ago
the way you should have.

21:20.078 --> 21:22.446
If I had called stacey
20 years ago,

21:22.447 --> 21:24.448
I might be married to her,
and you'd be sitting there
with al.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.615
So there's a downside here?

21:27.751 --> 21:29.652
Yeah.
Yeah?

21:29.653 --> 21:31.921
You wouldn't get
any more of this.

21:33.991 --> 21:38.928
You do this pretty well
for a big, fat, lying weasel.

21:59.683 --> 22:01.651
<i>(♪ western)</i>

22:17.701 --> 22:22.172
All right, vila,
there's only room in this shop
for one of us.

22:22.173 --> 22:25.308
Go for
your carpenter's square.

22:35.886 --> 22:39.523
That's pretty fancy shooting
there, partner.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.958
Not a mark on him.

22:43.661 --> 22:44.994
Defective gun, al.

22:55.439 --> 22:58.508
<i>(woman)</i> 5, 4, 3, 2...

23:01.212 --> 23:03.380
Just get through this.
Ok.

23:03.381 --> 23:04.614
Great.

23:05.683 --> 23:07.584
So, jill...

23:07.585 --> 23:10.019
I'm sorry.

23:12.056 --> 23:13.022
Great.
