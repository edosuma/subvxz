.

00:05.130 --> 00:05.547
[soft music]

00:07.882 --> 00:10.385
- Sun is coming up.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.304
What?

00:13.346 --> 00:17.183
- [sighs] Nothing.

00:17.225 --> 00:20.353
- [sighs] You've been
holding back all night.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.105
It's OK to say
you're mad at me.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.524
- I'm not.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.360
I'm mad at myself.

00:27.402 --> 00:31.072
You've always been clear
about who you are

00:31.114 --> 00:33.658
and the lines
you're willing to cross

00:33.700 --> 00:36.703
to save a life.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.372
I used to be.

00:39.414 --> 00:43.710
But lately, I've been

00:43.752 --> 00:45.712
blurring my own lines.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.714
- You saying
I'm a bad influence?

00:47.756 --> 00:49.299
- [chuckles]

00:49.341 --> 00:53.053
* *

00:53.094 --> 00:54.304
- You know I can't
remember a morning

00:54.346 --> 00:56.264
that didn't start
at the precinct?

00:56.306 --> 00:59.517
Even as a kid,
my dad brought me in,

00:59.559 --> 01:02.896
just like his dad did
with him.

01:02.937 --> 01:05.565
Being a cop is--

01:05.607 --> 01:06.941
is who I am.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.194
But fighting
on the right side,

01:09.235 --> 01:12.655
that's just--
that's in my blood.

01:12.697 --> 01:17.285
I don't know who I am
without the badge, and it--

01:17.327 --> 01:19.871
it scares me.

01:19.913 --> 01:26.795
* *

01:28.046 --> 01:30.215
- [sighs] Well,

01:30.256 --> 01:32.842
if you had to choose
a new line of work,

01:32.884 --> 01:33.927
what would you do?

01:33.968 --> 01:37.764
Would you be an exotic dancer?

01:37.806 --> 01:39.557
Instagram chef?

01:40.975 --> 01:42.310
- I play a mean French horn.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.937
- [laughs]
- I was first chair

01:43.978 --> 01:45.522
in my middle school band.

01:45.563 --> 01:48.108
I defended it
every week and won.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.777
[laughter]

01:50.819 --> 01:52.362
What about you, Gabi?

01:52.404 --> 01:55.782
Anything you loved growing up?

01:55.824 --> 02:01.037
* *

02:01.079 --> 02:02.872
[birds chirping]

02:02.914 --> 02:04.874
- I love them.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.627
- They're starlings.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.213
- Why are they
dancing like that?

02:10.255 --> 02:12.465
- It's called a murmuration.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.342
There are theories,
but the actual reasoning

02:14.384 --> 02:16.636
behind their synchronized
flight remains a mystery.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.222
- * I've been
wandering around all day *

02:19.264 --> 02:23.893
- "At the same time that we are
earnest to explore all things,

02:23.935 --> 02:27.313
we require that all things
be mysterious."

02:27.355 --> 02:30.483
- Walden.
Very good.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.194
As you know, Thoreau spent
two years living in that cabin

02:33.236 --> 02:34.654
by himself, and he believed

02:34.696 --> 02:37.699
that solitude
was an incredible gift.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.659
Gave him a new
perspective on life.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.120
- I think I understand
what he meant.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.790
- * This made-up falsifier *

02:45.832 --> 02:48.168
- I've come
to love it here too.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.086
I'm glad you brought me.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.213
* *

02:52.255 --> 02:57.302
- I'm so happy you've come
to accept our life together.

02:57.344 --> 03:03.058
* *

03:03.099 --> 03:06.394
- Do you think we could
go outside and see them?

03:06.436 --> 03:10.565
- * Keep me there,
keep me through my nightmare *

03:10.607 --> 03:14.235
* I'm alone,
waiting on the antidote *

03:14.277 --> 03:17.697
* Be a lamb,
keep me by my right hand *

03:17.739 --> 03:23.995
* I'm alone, give me
all the love you got *

[tense music]

03:27.040 --> 03:34.255

03:36.383 --> 03:39.344
- [grunts]

03:39.386 --> 03:41.930
Gabrielle!

03:44.140 --> 03:45.392
- Gabi.

03:45.433 --> 03:46.810
- This is a surprise.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.561
I'm usually the one
going to the press,

03:48.603 --> 03:49.979
not the other way around.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.399
- Is this her,
the one that finds people?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.401
- That's me.
Gabi Mosely, Ms....

03:54.442 --> 03:56.903
- My granddaughter,
Denae Wagon, is missing,

03:56.945 --> 04:00.073
and--and the press
refuse to report on it.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.951
- My boss doesn't think that
Denae's story is big enough

04:02.992 --> 04:04.411
to be considered news yet.

04:04.452 --> 04:07.455
- She's pregnant
and due any day.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.041
Please, help me.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.127
- Of course I will.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.421
[dramatic vocal music]

04:14.462 --> 04:16.089
[soft exhale]

04:16.131 --> 04:18.216
* *

04:18.967 --> 04:21.136
- That's Denae
a couple of months ago

04:21.177 --> 04:22.887
with her kindergarten class.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.640
She was six months
pregnant then.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.561
I'm not resting until
my granddaughter's found.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.272
- And neither are we,
but in order to find Denae,

04:32.313 --> 04:33.523
we need information.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.984
[dramatic music]

04:36.026 --> 04:38.653
So Denae lives here in D.C.?

04:38.695 --> 04:41.614
- Yeah, she moved off
of our tribe's reservation

04:41.656 --> 04:44.951
in Virginia about a year ago.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.703
* *

04:46.745 --> 04:47.871
- You still live
on the reservation?

04:47.912 --> 04:50.540
- Of course.
It's my home.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.084
And Denae was coming home
to have the baby,

04:53.126 --> 04:55.795
and I've just been
getting everything ready

04:55.837 --> 04:57.464
for her and the little one.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.424
- When was the last time
you spoke to Denae?

04:59.466 --> 05:00.967
- Yesterday morning.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.470
It's about a three-hour drive
to the reservation,

05:03.511 --> 05:06.598
and--and she was supposed
to be there by midnight,

05:06.639 --> 05:08.391
but she never arrived.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.143
- Maybe she stopped
at a hotel for the night.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.770
- She would have called.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.189
Or--or at least she would have
answered when I called.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.690
And she's not answering.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.318
- Did you ask D.C. police
to do a welfare check?

05:18.360 --> 05:19.903
- [scoffs]

05:19.944 --> 05:22.489
Police don't
get involved with us.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.908
- I am going to need
the name of every person

05:24.949 --> 05:27.118
Denae spent time with
in D.C.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.536
- There's no list.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.831
Just one guy, Charlie Rutledge.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.668
He's the baby's father,
and he lives with her.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.545
- You don't like him?
- That boy is a white devil.

05:37.587 --> 05:41.633
And he is repeatedly
asking her how much

05:41.675 --> 05:43.843
her per capita payment is.

05:43.885 --> 05:44.844
- What is that?

05:44.886 --> 05:46.930
- It's money that's distributed

05:46.971 --> 05:50.809
to tribal members
from tribally owned businesses.

05:50.850 --> 05:54.604
And Denae and--and Charlie
have been fighting a lot

05:54.646 --> 05:58.900
about money lately, and I think
he's after that per cap.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.568
[phone buzzes]

06:01.611 --> 06:03.613
- We are going to do
everything we can

06:03.655 --> 06:06.950
to bring her
and your grandbaby home.

06:06.991 --> 06:10.036
- Thank you.

06:10.078 --> 06:14.374
You know, I wouldn't turn down
a ride to the bus station.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.458
- Yes, ma'am.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.836
* *

06:17.877 --> 06:20.046
- What you got?
- Charlie was in a car accident

06:20.088 --> 06:21.715
a couple hours ago,
just arrived

06:21.756 --> 06:23.883
at Washington, D.C.,
Memorial Hospital.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.552
- Lucky us.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.595
- I still can't understand why
the police won't get involved.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.097
- Because Denae is Indigenous

06:29.139 --> 06:30.724
and we don't know exactly
where she went missing,

06:30.765 --> 06:32.434
it leaves room
for jurisdictional debate

06:32.475 --> 06:34.060
with her tribe's
law enforcement.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.562
And debate means--

06:35.603 --> 06:38.106
- The victim inevitably
falls between the cracks.

06:41.026 --> 06:43.403
- I'll give you three guesses
what caused the accident.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.989
- Tequila, tequila, tequila.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.908
- [groans] Cops or lawyers?

06:48.950 --> 06:52.287
- When is the last time you saw
your girlfriend, Denae Wagon?

06:52.328 --> 06:53.580
- You found her?

06:53.621 --> 06:55.206
- You saying she's missing?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.750
- No!

06:56.791 --> 06:58.752
No, I...

06:58.793 --> 07:00.545
just haven't talked
to her since yesterday,

07:00.587 --> 07:01.838
before my shift.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.424
- What do you do?
- I'm a mixologist.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.926
- So bartender?

07:06.968 --> 07:08.470
- Walk me through
your day today.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.014
* *

07:11.056 --> 07:14.059
- I came home early
this morning from work.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.352
Denae wasn't there.

07:15.393 --> 07:18.063
When she didn't answer
her phone, I got worried.

07:18.104 --> 07:21.399
I was afraid her car
broke down or something.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.817
[echoing]
Thing's a piece of crap.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.694
I drove around
looking for her,

07:24.736 --> 07:26.905
and that damn sedan...

07:26.946 --> 07:28.865
[normally]
Oh--braked too fast--

07:28.907 --> 07:29.949
[stomach grumbling]
- Charlie?

07:29.991 --> 07:31.326
- Oh, incoming.
- Oh!

07:31.368 --> 07:34.954
- [retching]

07:34.996 --> 07:36.456
- Ew.
- So Charlie really went

07:36.498 --> 07:37.874
full-on "Exorcist"?

07:37.916 --> 07:40.251
- Missed Gabi's
designer shoes by an inch.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.795
- He was in no condition
to talk.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.296
Thankfully, he didn't need to.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.131
- So he had scratches
on his dominant hand,

07:45.173 --> 07:47.133
as if he's punched something
multiple times.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.427
They're all scabbed over,
so it was an old injury,

07:49.469 --> 07:50.720
not from the accident.

07:50.762 --> 07:51.805
- Punched something
like a person?

07:51.846 --> 07:53.264
- Possibly, or a wall.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.641
I mean, he definitely
talks with his fists.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.309
- Dhan, vet his work alibi.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.061
And in the meantime, don't let
Charlie out of your sight.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.021
If he's done something
to Denae, we'll know.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.565
I am asking Trent
to run a check on him,

08:02.607 --> 08:06.319
see if he's ever been arrested
for domestic abuse or--ah.

08:06.361 --> 08:07.779
- What is it?

08:07.821 --> 08:10.073
- Trent won't have access
to the DCPD system.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.492
He's been suspended.

08:12.534 --> 08:13.576
- Let me guess--

08:13.618 --> 08:14.744
the zip drive.

08:14.786 --> 08:15.995
- How's he doing?

08:16.037 --> 08:18.123
- [sighs]
He's going stir-crazy.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.001
But we can still use him
to consult on this job.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.836
We need the manpower,
and he needs

08:22.877 --> 08:24.671
something important
to focus on.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.089
- I'll see if I can find
a criminal record.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.008
- No, focus on the phone
that I swiped.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.676
Lacey, see if Shaker can help
us with the criminal record.

08:29.718 --> 08:30.844
- Already got into the phone.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.345
Looks like Denae and Charlie's

08:32.387 --> 08:33.972
last text exchange
got a little heated.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.849
- "You're a screwup
and an ass, Charlie.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.518
I needed you there for support,
but of course you're MIA."

08:38.560 --> 08:40.020
"It was one doc appointment.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.438
"You are not the first woman
to have a damn baby.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.522
Get over yourself."

08:42.564 --> 08:43.815
Wow.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.191
- I need that doc's
information.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.693
- Texting it to you
as we speak.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.153
[rain pattering over speakers]

08:48.194 --> 08:50.697
- Sorry for intruding
on your home, Dr. Potter,

08:50.739 --> 08:52.490
but this couldn't wait.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.285
- I'm used to having patients
drop by at all times,

08:55.326 --> 08:56.745
so I'm happy to help.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.413
- I can tell you're someone
who cares about

08:58.455 --> 08:59.622
your patients' well-being.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.458
- Oh, my work is my life.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.169
And my patients
are like family,

09:04.210 --> 09:05.795
which is why I'm concerned
to hear

09:05.837 --> 09:07.047
that Denae may be missing.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.840
I only just saw her yesterday.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.133
- And how was she?

09:10.175 --> 09:11.760
Did anything happen
during that visit

09:11.801 --> 09:13.094
that seemed to upset her?

09:13.136 --> 09:14.929
- Well, Denae asked me
what I thought

09:14.971 --> 09:18.016
about her having the baby
on the tribe's reservation.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.227
I said it wasn't a good idea,
which initially upset her.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.646
But she understood
what was at stake,

09:23.688 --> 09:26.191
and, well, eventually
she promised me

09:26.232 --> 09:27.859
that she'd have the baby
in a hospital.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.652
So we have a plan in place.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.071
- Why were you
against Denae having

09:31.112 --> 09:32.697
the baby on her reservation?

09:32.739 --> 09:34.532
- Well, I wish I could say,
but it's

09:34.574 --> 09:36.368
doctor-patient confidentiality.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.786
- Of course.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.079
Discretion is important
in what we do too.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.081
But we both want
the same things here,

09:41.122 --> 09:42.916
and that's to help find Denae.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.668
This is how you help her.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.003
- All right.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.297
But only because
of Denae's condition.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.924
Time is working against her.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.342
- What's her condition?

09:52.384 --> 09:53.927
- Denae's baby is breeched.

09:53.968 --> 09:57.430
Denae is due soon, and if
she tries to have this baby

09:57.472 --> 09:58.890
without proper medical care--

09:58.932 --> 10:01.309
- It's likely she
and the baby won't make it.

10:05.397 --> 10:05.772
.

10:05.814 --> 10:06.272
[dramatic music]

10:08.400 --> 10:09.693
- Did you hear me?

10:09.734 --> 10:11.444
A baby's life is in jeopardy.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.613
- Who's Heavy Boots,

10:13.655 --> 10:15.240
the man you let into the house?

10:15.281 --> 10:19.536
That was quite the risk,
which means he's important.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.205
Who is he?

10:22.247 --> 10:24.207
- Denae was on her way
to the reservation

10:24.249 --> 10:26.710
but appears to have--
- He made you laugh.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.879
- Yes, he did.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.674
- Did you...

10:32.716 --> 10:34.592
sleep with him?

10:34.634 --> 10:37.053
* *

10:37.095 --> 10:38.763
- I have a woman
and baby to save.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.224
Get yourself up to speed, and
give me something I can use.

10:41.266 --> 10:46.688
* *

10:46.730 --> 10:48.231
- Pulled these
from her social.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.691
Denae didn't really
have much of a life

10:49.733 --> 10:51.234
outside of work and Charlie.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.777
- We're still trying
to track down her principal,

10:52.819 --> 10:54.529
but by all accounts,
she loves her job.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.990
- All right,
Charlie's never been arrested

10:57.032 --> 10:59.784
for domestic violence,
just bar fights.

11:00.952 --> 11:04.706
Sorry for the delay
in getting these records.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.416
Shaker's been buried
under cases.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.251
- And you feel guilty
about that.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.754
- Please don't.
Don't feel sorry for me.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.131
Don't read me.
Don't any of it.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.592
I made my bed, and I just--

11:15.633 --> 11:16.760
I just want to focus on Denae.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.261
- OK.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.764
Bar fights still speak
to violent tendencies,

11:20.805 --> 11:22.182
so Charlie stays on the list.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.601
Zeke, what's the video?

11:24.642 --> 11:26.061
[computer beeps]

11:27.562 --> 11:28.855
- Hey, baby.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.398
Mommy can't wait to meet you.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.108
- Pregnancy's
such an exciting time.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.943
Denae should be
nesting and planning.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.278
Instead she's God knows where.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.113
- Do we have
any pictures of her

11:37.155 --> 11:39.199
actually on the reservation?
- Not that I could find.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.950
- If she loved
her time there so much,

11:40.992 --> 11:43.286
why is there no evidence of
her life there anywhere online?

11:43.328 --> 11:45.121
- Unless she
wasn't happy there.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.332
I mean, she did leave
and build a life here in D.C.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.167
- This is the only reference
I could find

11:49.209 --> 11:50.752
in any of her postings.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.170
- "I know who I am.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.630
"You can't take that from me.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.006
#NativeAndProud."

11:55.048 --> 11:56.466
- She seems to be
straddling the line

11:56.508 --> 11:58.218
between two worlds,
D.C. and the reservation.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.136
- The question is,
which side of the line

12:00.178 --> 12:01.471
did she disappear on?

12:01.513 --> 12:04.265
- Mm.
Anything on her phone records?

12:04.307 --> 12:06.726
- Looks like she called
three people last night.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.353
Two were unknown.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.940
The other's to a coworker
named Hannah Cress.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.192
- Thank you for agreeing
to meet with us, Hannah.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.027
- Did Charlie hire you
to find Denae?

12:16.069 --> 12:18.488
- [echoing]
No, her grandmother Rose did.

12:18.530 --> 12:22.450
* *

12:22.492 --> 12:25.328
- [normally] You don't
like Charlie, do you?

12:25.370 --> 12:28.498
- Couple weeks ago,
I found Denae crying in her car

12:28.540 --> 12:29.791
outside the school.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.251
It wasn't the first time.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.128
She told me that she
and Charlie had been

12:33.169 --> 12:34.546
fighting over his drinking.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.881
It wasn't the first time
she told me that either.

12:36.923 --> 12:40.593
This time, though, he punched
a wall, almost hitting her.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.095
It really shook her up.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.514
- Yet she stayed with him.
Was she scared to leave?

12:44.556 --> 12:46.391
- Not once she had
a baby to protect.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.394
That's why even though
she loved her job, she quit.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.604
- She quit?
Rose didn't mention that.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.273
- Well, nobody knew except me
and the principal.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.316
Denae did not want it
getting back to Charlie.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.861
- So Denae wasn't just going
back home to have her baby.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.155
She was moving back
to the reservation permanently.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.531
Is that right?
- Yes.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.616
Denae genuinely
missed her community.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.577
- So we know that Denae
called you last night.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.870
Do you remember
anything that she said

13:06.911 --> 13:07.996
that could be helpful?

13:08.038 --> 13:09.122
- I don't have to remember it.

13:09.164 --> 13:10.915
I have a voice mail.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.625
I missed her call.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.044
[beep]
- Hey.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.879
Just letting you know
I'm almost home.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.380
Wait, hold on.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.632
I'll text you when I arrive.
Love you.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.384
[speaking indistinctly,
object rustles]

13:21.426 --> 13:23.762
- I tried calling her back,
but she wouldn't pick up.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.556
- So Denae was almost back home
at the reservation.

13:26.598 --> 13:29.017
The question is,
what or who stopped her

13:29.059 --> 13:30.185
from getting there?

13:30.226 --> 13:32.020
- You lied about your alibi.

13:32.062 --> 13:36.649
- If that Indian PI dude left
a bruise, I'm pressing charges.

13:36.691 --> 13:37.942
- What Indian dude?

13:37.984 --> 13:39.861
I don't see anybody, Charlie.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.072
But you know what I do see

13:42.113 --> 13:45.575
is a hungover,
sorry excuse of a boyfriend

13:45.617 --> 13:47.243
and father-to-be.

13:47.285 --> 13:50.497
So why don't we
just focus on him?

13:50.538 --> 13:54.459
- I like her style.
- Oh, best partner I ever had.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.586
- You know
Mallory will have your ass

13:56.628 --> 13:58.463
if he knows you're here.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.507
- I can't just sit on my hands.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.050
* *

14:02.092 --> 14:06.179
- Now, you know,
lying about your work alibi,

14:06.221 --> 14:08.473
that's the fastest way
to get on my nerves.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.643
And, Charles, that is not
a place you want to be.

14:11.685 --> 14:15.271
* *

14:15.313 --> 14:18.441
- I was with a girl I met
during my shift, OK?

14:18.483 --> 14:20.610
I was dreading going home
since Denae I were fighting,

14:20.652 --> 14:21.778
so I clocked off early

14:21.820 --> 14:23.238
and spent
the whole night with her.

14:23.279 --> 14:27.200
We went to another bar
after my shift.

14:27.242 --> 14:30.245
Here's the receipt.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.789
- Cheating on your
pregnant girlfriend.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.666
Really?
- It's not a crime.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.042
Can I go now?

14:36.084 --> 14:37.711
- Receipt or not,
you got at least

14:37.752 --> 14:40.380
five seconds to tell me
if you had anything to do

14:40.422 --> 14:43.341
with Denae, or else.
- Or what?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.176
- Or us.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.554
* *

14:47.595 --> 14:50.640
- You better start talking,
Charlie.

14:50.682 --> 14:53.393
- Go ahead.
I'll still say the same thing.

14:53.435 --> 14:57.188
I didn't lay a finger on Denae,
and I don't know where she is.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.858
* *

14:59.899 --> 15:02.277
Look, we may fight a lot,

15:02.318 --> 15:04.779
and yeah, I got a temper, OK?

15:04.821 --> 15:06.865
But I love Denae and that kid.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.658
I need them to be OK.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.702
* *

15:10.744 --> 15:12.495
- Then help us, Charlie.

15:12.537 --> 15:17.083
Who would try to stop Denae
from going to the reservation?

15:17.125 --> 15:19.085
- Wait, what?

15:19.127 --> 15:21.504
Denae wouldn't go back there.
She hated the reservation.

15:21.546 --> 15:24.174
- She was headed back.
We know for a fact she was.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.842
- I seriously doubt that.

15:25.884 --> 15:28.178
She never said why,
but I always got the feeling

15:28.219 --> 15:29.846
she had problems
with somebody there.

15:29.888 --> 15:33.558
Always said it was the last
place she'd ever go back to.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.019
- I guess your instincts about
Denae's complicated feelings

15:36.061 --> 15:37.520
for her reservation
were correct.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.189
- If Denae was having issues
with someone

15:39.230 --> 15:40.857
at the reservation,
wouldn't that be something

15:40.899 --> 15:43.151
her grandmother would know
and should have volunteered?

15:43.193 --> 15:45.528
- [sighs]
[phone ringing and buzzing]

15:45.570 --> 15:47.405
[phone beeps]

15:47.447 --> 15:49.074
- You're not gonna even
check who that is?

15:49.115 --> 15:50.492
- I know who it is.
It's my union rep.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.993
He's been trying
to reach me all day.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.536
- Trent, you can't
avoid talking--

15:53.578 --> 15:55.163
- All he is going to tell me
is to give you up

15:55.205 --> 15:56.539
as the person who stole
the thumb drive

15:56.581 --> 15:58.208
so my job can be reinstated.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.710
And that's not an option,
so please let it go.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.838
* *

16:03.880 --> 16:05.215
- [sighs]

16:05.256 --> 16:07.008
- No hits on Denae's car
here in D.C.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.177
or any sight of it on the
highway to the reservation.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.637
It's like it just disappeared.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.514
- We need boots
on the ground there.

16:12.555 --> 16:13.765
- Gabi.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.350
- Dhan is setting up
surveillance at Charlie's

16:15.392 --> 16:17.018
in case Denae comes back.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.395
Margaret is headed
over to Zeke's

16:18.436 --> 16:20.146
with Denae's
voice mail to Hannah

16:20.188 --> 16:21.564
to see if we can clean it up.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.900
Outside of that,
we've exhausted

16:23.942 --> 16:25.610
all paths here in D.C., Lace.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.238
It's time to go
to the reservation.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.573
- In Virginia?

16:30.615 --> 16:32.659
Past--

16:32.701 --> 16:33.868
past our farmhouse?

16:33.910 --> 16:36.079
- I understand if you can't go.
I do.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.707
It's OK.
Trent will be with me.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.126
- It's a perk of not having
a badge right now.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.210
I don't have to worry
about creating

16:42.252 --> 16:43.878
a jurisdictional problem.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.797
I can just help.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.133
- No, no.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.635
I'll come.
I want to come.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.138
I can't avoid an entire state
just because something bad

16:53.179 --> 16:55.932
happened to me once, right?

16:55.974 --> 16:57.684
This is for Denae.

16:57.726 --> 17:00.395
- Boyfriend is controlling,
possessive.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.605
- Yeah?
Tell me something I don't know.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.649
- Denae stayed with him despite
these unbecoming attributes.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.444
Implies they are
familiar to her.

17:07.485 --> 17:08.903
Control, possession--

17:08.945 --> 17:11.531
she's experienced that
before in her life.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.324
Likely someone close to her.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.494
Family member, maybe.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.621
You're going to the
reservation, aren't you?

17:18.663 --> 17:22.125
Ensuring ample sustenance
while you're gone.

17:22.167 --> 17:24.961
I see.
Is Heavy Boots going with you?

17:25.003 --> 17:27.422
- The grandmother
isn't the controlling sort.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.966
Maybe someone else she was
close to on the reservation?

17:30.008 --> 17:31.426
Maybe that's why she left.

17:31.468 --> 17:34.971
- I don't appreciate you
ignoring my question.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.307
[phone ringing and buzzing]

17:37.349 --> 17:38.892
[phone clicks]

17:38.933 --> 17:40.977
- [flirtatiously] Hey, you.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.771
[urgently] Where was the car?

17:42.812 --> 17:49.444
* *

17:49.486 --> 17:52.447
- All right, we are technically
on the reservation.

17:52.489 --> 17:53.865
One of my buddies
at Virginia PD

17:53.907 --> 17:55.658
said a report about
Denae's abandoned car

17:55.700 --> 17:57.786
came in just a few hours ago.

17:57.827 --> 18:00.705
* *

18:00.747 --> 18:02.290
- It's locked.

18:02.332 --> 18:03.875
- I got it.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.336
* *

18:06.378 --> 18:09.130
[glass shattering]

18:09.172 --> 18:10.840
- I like suspended Trent.

18:10.882 --> 18:17.931
* *

18:19.599 --> 18:21.017
Is that--

18:21.059 --> 18:22.477
- Blood.

18:27.148 --> 18:27.524
.

18:27.565 --> 18:28.900
- All right, well, there's
nothing wrong with the car,

18:30.443 --> 18:31.486
which means
it didn't break down.

18:31.528 --> 18:32.904
And the gas tank is full too.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.115
- We passed a gas station
a half mile up.

18:35.156 --> 18:37.701
If Denae went into early labor
or needed help

18:37.742 --> 18:39.661
and couldn't drive,
maybe she stopped there.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.996
If they have surveillance
footage, Zeke will find it.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.873
[phone beeps]

18:43.915 --> 18:46.084
[dramatic music]

18:46.126 --> 18:49.337
- [echoing] Is it too much
to ask for a decent meal?

18:49.379 --> 18:51.047
- [normally] Lacey, you OK?

18:51.089 --> 18:52.632
* *

18:52.674 --> 18:54.551
- [whimpers]
Yeah.

18:54.592 --> 18:55.969
- Get away from the car.

18:56.011 --> 18:58.263
- Hey, hey, hey. Whoa.
It's OK. It's OK.

18:58.304 --> 19:03.226
I'm--we are private
investigators.

19:03.268 --> 19:04.561
You can lower the gun.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.229
- I don't trust folks
I don't know.

19:06.271 --> 19:09.315
So I'll ask you again,
step away from the car.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.609
- I don't think you understand.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.778
This vehicle belongs to--

19:13.820 --> 19:16.489
- Denae Wagon.
- Wait. You know Denae?

19:16.531 --> 19:17.991
- She's my sister.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.827
- I know you don't know us,
but I promise you

19:20.869 --> 19:24.080
our only intention
is to help you find out

19:24.122 --> 19:25.749
what happened to your sister.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.334
- Why should I believe you?

19:27.375 --> 19:31.838
- Because your grandma Rose
hired us to find Denae.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.299
Now, normally I would take time
for pleasantries.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.844
But after what we just found,
we have no time to waste.

19:37.886 --> 19:40.305
* *

19:40.347 --> 19:42.724
- Oh, my God.
- It's blood.

19:42.766 --> 19:45.435
Denae could be in early labor
or hurt or both.

19:45.477 --> 19:46.853
We need to search this area.

19:46.895 --> 19:48.229
- Look, we started forming
a search party

19:48.271 --> 19:49.522
on the reservation.

19:49.564 --> 19:51.649
Hey, get everybody here--now!

19:51.691 --> 19:54.152
- You heard him.
Let's go, guys. Let's go!

19:54.194 --> 19:55.904
* *

19:55.945 --> 19:59.240
- Denae!
- Denae!

19:59.282 --> 20:02.118
- Denae!

20:02.160 --> 20:05.372
- Denae! Denae!

20:05.413 --> 20:07.874
- Denae!

20:07.916 --> 20:10.377
Denae!

20:10.418 --> 20:17.133
* *

20:20.470 --> 20:24.307
[phone beeping]

20:24.349 --> 20:26.768
- Denae!

20:26.810 --> 20:29.521
- Pick up.
[line ringing]

20:29.562 --> 20:31.147
- Still no answer
from the gas station?

20:31.189 --> 20:33.733
- No, and whatever system
they use must be hard-lined,

20:33.775 --> 20:35.527
because I can't hack in at all.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.070
- Here, listen to this.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.406
- Hey, just letting you know
I'm almost home.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.907
Wait, hold on.

20:40.949 --> 20:43.493
I'll text you when I arrive.
Love you.

20:43.535 --> 20:44.828
[speaking indistinctly,
object rustles]

20:44.869 --> 20:46.371
- Did you hear that at the end?

20:46.413 --> 20:47.622
- Yeah, Denae said
something else.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.165
- Yeah, but I can't
make it out.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.959
Can--can you--can you
isolate the last, like,

20:51.001 --> 20:53.169
four seconds
and boost the audio?

20:53.211 --> 20:54.421
- Yeah, I'm on it.

20:54.462 --> 20:58.466
* *

20:58.508 --> 20:59.926
You can go to the bus station.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.594
I can send this to you
when it's done.

21:01.636 --> 21:03.430
- No, I still have
a few minutes.

21:03.471 --> 21:06.599
- OK.

21:06.641 --> 21:09.102
[computer beeping]
[sighs] Jeez, I--

21:09.144 --> 21:11.438
I hate not being on the
reservation, looking with them.

21:11.479 --> 21:12.939
- Yeah, I know.
- [sighs]

21:12.981 --> 21:15.817
- But we're looking from here,
in our own way.

21:15.859 --> 21:18.069
- And that's enough for you?

21:18.111 --> 21:19.571
- Yeah, it has to be.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.948
With every new case, I have
to be cognizant of how long

21:21.990 --> 21:23.575
it'll take me to get back
to the bus station,

21:23.616 --> 21:25.452
'cause I have
to be there by 9:00 p.m.

21:25.493 --> 21:29.122
I mean, I miss out on a lot
of moments because of that,

21:29.164 --> 21:30.457
like the search right now.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.250
But we can't think of it
as failing.

21:32.292 --> 21:35.628
I mean, we're coping
so that we can help.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.130
We're doing the best we can.

21:37.172 --> 21:40.592
And that best has brought
a lot of people home.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.136
- Yeah.

21:43.178 --> 21:44.679
[computer beeping]

21:44.721 --> 21:47.057
The audio file
is done rendering.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.476
- I'll text you when I arrive.
Love you.

21:49.517 --> 21:50.685
I missed you.
[object rustles]

21:50.727 --> 21:51.811
[line clicks, beeps]

21:51.853 --> 21:53.063
- Her voice changed.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.148
The "missed you"
was to someone else.

21:55.190 --> 21:58.068
But what was that rustling
at the end?

21:58.109 --> 21:59.652
- It was a hug.

21:59.694 --> 22:01.112
Denae knows this person.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.990
You have to find
the surveillance footage ASAP.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.201
- OK.

22:06.242 --> 22:09.287
[indistinct chatter]

22:09.329 --> 22:16.544
* *

22:19.589 --> 22:21.257
- So can you tell me
what happened?

22:21.299 --> 22:24.344
- Denae's father passed
when she was six,

22:24.386 --> 22:27.013
and her mother left
the family soon after.

22:27.055 --> 22:30.350
- It must have been hard,
raising two kids by yourself.

22:30.392 --> 22:34.979
- Yeah, it was hard on all
of us but the kids mostly.

22:35.021 --> 22:39.150
I worked a lot, and I
wasn't always around.

22:39.192 --> 22:42.362
- Who took care of the kids
while you were working?

22:42.404 --> 22:44.280
- I did.
I was the only one

22:44.322 --> 22:45.865
who was keeping her
out of trouble,

22:45.907 --> 22:47.742
while I was trying to keep
what was left

22:47.784 --> 22:49.536
of our family together.

22:49.577 --> 22:50.995
But none of that mattered.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.747
She chose a white boy
living in the big city

22:52.789 --> 22:54.040
over her own blood.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.710
- And this is why
I did not tell you

22:56.751 --> 22:58.378
that Denae was coming home.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.630
You hold on too tight, Kai.

23:00.672 --> 23:03.758
Denae has a right
to choose her own way.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.011
- Yeah, and look
what happened her.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.721
- I'm sorry, are you
blaming your sister

23:07.762 --> 23:09.305
for what's happening to her?

23:09.347 --> 23:11.683
- I don't blame her.

23:11.725 --> 23:13.560
I blame my grandmother.

23:13.601 --> 23:16.563
Look, you could have told me
that Denae was coming back.

23:16.604 --> 23:18.398
We could have worked
something out.

23:18.440 --> 23:22.777
* *

23:22.819 --> 23:25.864
- Is this Ada?
I'd love to talk to her.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.907
- You don't get to talk
to my wife

23:27.949 --> 23:30.076
or anyone else
on this reservation.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.078
If you have any questions,
you go through me.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.873
- This whole
controlling nonsense,

23:34.914 --> 23:36.916
is that why your sister
left in the first place?

23:36.958 --> 23:40.295
- You insult me as you stand
here as a guest in my home?

23:40.337 --> 23:41.588
- Kai.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.923
- Denae's case
is my jurisdiction.

23:43.965 --> 23:46.801
I decide how this investigation
is handled.

23:46.843 --> 23:53.391
* *

23:53.433 --> 23:55.143
So you're DCPD.

23:55.185 --> 23:58.563
What'd you get suspended for,
police brutality?

23:58.605 --> 24:02.150
- No, he took the fall for me
so I could save someone's life,

24:02.192 --> 24:05.111
which I am desperately
trying to do for your sister.

24:05.153 --> 24:06.780
* *

24:06.821 --> 24:09.491
- Seriously, nothing?

24:09.532 --> 24:10.992
- [sighs]

24:11.034 --> 24:13.620
- Nothing, not even
a rustle of a curtain?

24:13.661 --> 24:14.954
And I know they can hear us.

24:14.996 --> 24:16.790
- I didn't give Kai
enough credit.

24:16.831 --> 24:19.167
He has some serious control
over this community.

24:19.209 --> 24:21.795
- Denae is somewhere out there,
and no one cares.

24:21.836 --> 24:24.047
- They care.
They're just scared.

24:24.089 --> 24:25.924
I'm starting to think
Denae wasn't running

24:25.965 --> 24:29.302
from her community as much
as she was running from Kai.

24:29.344 --> 24:31.262
* *

24:31.304 --> 24:33.348
You OK?

24:33.390 --> 24:35.725
- [sighs]
No, but...

24:35.767 --> 24:39.020
I just want to find Denae and
get the hell out of Virginia.

24:39.062 --> 24:39.896
- I know.

24:39.938 --> 24:41.773
Hey, you're safe.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.108
Virginia is just a place.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.276
The farmhouse
is just a building.

24:45.318 --> 24:48.113
Sir has no control
or power over you anymore.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.489
- Thanks to you.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.491
- Are you the ones
asking around about Denae?

24:51.533 --> 24:54.202
- We are trying to find her
and bring her back home safe.

24:54.244 --> 24:56.079
- Are you sure she even
wants to come back home

24:56.121 --> 24:57.706
after what Kai did to her?

24:57.747 --> 25:00.333
* *

25:00.375 --> 25:02.377
- I was raised
in this community,

25:02.419 --> 25:05.088
with the same
traditions you all were.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.674
I am not defined
by an ID card.

25:07.716 --> 25:11.219
I am defined by my ancestors.

25:11.261 --> 25:14.264
I won't be stripped
of my heritage.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.057
[phone beeps]
- I recorded this

25:16.099 --> 25:17.892
at a tribal court hearing
for Denae.

25:17.934 --> 25:19.310
After she fell in love
with that white boy

25:19.352 --> 25:22.981
and left the reservation,
Kai was so angry,

25:23.023 --> 25:25.358
he tried to have her
disenrolled from our tribe.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.444
Denae came back,
fought for her right

25:27.485 --> 25:28.820
to stay a member,
and won.

25:28.862 --> 25:30.321
- Do you think
that Kai would try

25:30.363 --> 25:32.323
to stop Denae
from coming back?

25:32.365 --> 25:33.658
- Hard to say.

25:33.700 --> 25:38.496
He loves his sister,
but Kai hates disobedience.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.206
- Thank you so much
for speaking with us.

25:40.248 --> 25:42.542
I know you must be
taking a big risk.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.002
- Kai doesn't scare me.

25:44.044 --> 25:46.087
He and his wife have done
the worst on us,

25:46.129 --> 25:47.964
and my brother and I
are still standing.

25:48.006 --> 25:51.051
- His wife? Ada?
What happened?

25:51.092 --> 25:54.679
- My brother's wife and baby
died during childbirth,

25:54.721 --> 25:56.931
and Ada was their midwife.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.224
It was malpractice,
and we tried

25:58.266 --> 25:59.768
to have her license revoked,

25:59.809 --> 26:01.269
but Kai shut it down.

26:01.311 --> 26:03.271
- Ada's a midwife?

26:03.313 --> 26:04.898
[phone buzzing]

26:04.939 --> 26:06.900
- Excuse me.

26:06.941 --> 26:08.443
[phone beeps]
Hey, Zeke.

26:08.485 --> 26:10.195
- I got the footage
from the gas station.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.572
Just give me two minutes.
[phone beeps]

26:12.614 --> 26:15.575
[chain rattling]

26:15.617 --> 26:21.373
* *

26:21.414 --> 26:23.416
One more sec.
Almost got it.

26:23.458 --> 26:30.465
* *

26:36.054 --> 26:37.597
[phone clicks]

26:37.639 --> 26:38.598
You should have it.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.641
- Is that the link?

26:39.683 --> 26:41.393
- Pulling it up now.

26:41.434 --> 26:43.561
* *

26:43.603 --> 26:45.605
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.607
Here we go.
[phone beeps]

26:47.649 --> 26:50.026
- That must have been when
she was talking to Hannah.

26:50.068 --> 26:52.987
* *

26:53.029 --> 26:55.740
Oh, my God, Gabi.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.451
- That's why Kai didn't
want us to talk to her.

26:58.493 --> 27:01.496
Ada was the last person
to see Denae.

27:06.376 --> 27:06.584
.

27:06.626 --> 27:07.752
- Rose said Ada was here?
- Yeah, but, Lacey,

27:08.962 --> 27:10.505
we have
to handle this carefully.

27:10.547 --> 27:12.048
[dramatic music]

27:12.090 --> 27:14.426
- Lacey, wait!

27:14.467 --> 27:15.552
- Where's Denae?

27:15.593 --> 27:17.345
We know you were
at the gas station.

27:17.387 --> 27:18.722
What happened?
She go into labor?

27:18.763 --> 27:20.890
You kill that baby too?
- Lacey!

27:20.932 --> 27:22.976
- [crying]

27:23.018 --> 27:25.020
- Stop!
You can't go in there, please!

27:25.061 --> 27:29.274
* *

27:29.315 --> 27:32.736
You just disrupted a woman
in the process of transitioning

27:32.777 --> 27:34.446
into the spirit world.

27:34.487 --> 27:38.033
- I set clear boundaries,
and you blew right past them,

interrupting a sacred ceremony

27:40.535 --> 27:44.247
and accusing my wife
for somehow being responsible

27:44.289 --> 27:45.915
for Denae's disappearance?

27:45.957 --> 27:49.836
The disrespect that you have
shown me and this community

27:49.878 --> 27:51.421
is inexcusable.

27:51.463 --> 27:52.589
- It's my fault.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.966
* *

27:55.008 --> 27:57.844
What happened back there,
the way I reacted,

27:57.886 --> 27:59.929
it wasn't like me,
and I'm sorry.

27:59.971 --> 28:03.224
- It was never our intention
to disrespect your community,

28:03.266 --> 28:04.851
and for that, we apologize.

28:04.893 --> 28:07.937
But the fact still remains
that Ada was the last person

28:07.979 --> 28:10.106
to see Denae,
and she lied about it.

28:10.148 --> 28:12.442
There's video proof.

28:12.484 --> 28:14.903
- Ada, what are they
talking about?

28:14.944 --> 28:16.112
- Damn it, answer her.

28:16.154 --> 28:17.530
Did Denae go into labor?

28:17.572 --> 28:19.574
Did something happen
to her or the baby?

28:19.616 --> 28:23.286
- I swear, I'm not responsible
for her disappearance.

28:23.328 --> 28:24.788
- Just like you
aren't responsible

28:24.829 --> 28:28.583
for that mom and baby
that died under your care?

28:28.625 --> 28:30.543
- Did May tell you that?

28:30.585 --> 28:33.838
Did she also tell you that her
sister-in-law had eclampsia?

28:33.880 --> 28:38.176
There was nothing I could have
done to save either of them.

28:38.218 --> 28:40.470
- Why was Denae upset
on the video?

28:40.512 --> 28:42.764
- Because I told her
that I changed my mind

28:42.806 --> 28:44.182
about delivering her baby.

28:44.224 --> 28:46.309
There was always so much
arguing and hostility

28:46.351 --> 28:48.645
between Kai and Denae,
so I told her

28:48.687 --> 28:51.564
it would be best for her
to have her baby in D.C.

28:51.606 --> 28:55.985
But then when I found out
she was missing, I felt guilty.

28:56.027 --> 28:58.905
I was the one
who turned her away.

28:58.947 --> 29:01.449
- I want you off
my reservation.

29:01.491 --> 29:05.245
- This is not about you, Kai.

29:05.286 --> 29:07.122
So they're staying.

29:07.163 --> 29:11.167
* *

29:11.209 --> 29:13.795
- You do what you want,
but I'm gonna continue

29:13.837 --> 29:15.839
the search without them.

29:15.880 --> 29:21.803
* *

29:21.845 --> 29:23.513
- You guys go join the search.

29:23.555 --> 29:25.432
I have to go over
a couple of things.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.600
It feels like there's something
in this case we're missing.

29:27.642 --> 29:30.353
I'll meet up
with you guys later.

35:37.846 --> 35:39.514
- Yeah.
- And the baby?

35:39.556 --> 35:41.474
- Wasn't with her,
which is why we think

35:41.516 --> 35:42.809
that it'll be
a good idea for Denae

35:42.851 --> 35:44.561
if you were there
when she woke up.

35:44.602 --> 35:46.980
I mean, her recovery
won't be easy,

35:47.022 --> 35:48.815

the only face

35:48.857 --> 35:52.068
that she trusts right now,
and she'll need you.

35:52.110 --> 35:53.903

I can't come at the moment.

35:53.945 --> 35:56.781
You caught me on my way out.
I'm in a bit of a rush.

she's your patient.

Yes, of course.

36:24.517 --> 36:27.187
Stay here.

- Mm.

36:29.189 --> 36:35.945

36:35.987 --> 36:38.156

to the on-call ob-gyn,

36:38.198 --> 36:40.867
there's no way Denae could have
delivered her own baby.

36:40.909 --> 36:43.912
The bruising on her abdomen
and the incisions made

36:43.953 --> 36:46.873
to help her deliver the baby
aren't self-inflicted.

36:46.915 --> 36:49.209
- So someone delivered
the baby for her out there?

36:49.250 --> 36:50.877
- Someone who knew
what they were doing.

36:50.919 --> 36:53.380
- Ada?
Maybe she had everyone fooled.

36:53.421 --> 36:56.883
- The last thing Denae said
to me before she passed out

36:56.925 --> 36:59.386
was "baby" and "doctor."

36:59.427 --> 37:03.056
I think she was trying to tell
me her doctor took the baby.

OK, come here, bubba.
Come here, bubba.

37:26.663 --> 37:29.416
Come here. Come here.

37:29.457 --> 37:31.292
I got you. I got you.

37:32.794 --> 37:34.838
[gasps]
- Give me my baby.

37:34.879 --> 37:37.590
- This is Denae's baby,
not yours.

37:37.632 --> 37:39.551
I'm a mom.
I know the signs.

37:39.592 --> 37:40.760
The dark circles
under your eyes--

37:40.802 --> 37:42.095
you haven't been sleeping.

37:42.137 --> 37:43.722
The--the muddy
boots in the foyer,

37:43.763 --> 37:44.848
as if you've been walking
through the forest.

37:44.889 --> 37:46.391
And the rain soundtrack.

37:46.433 --> 37:47.642
It's for newborns.

37:47.684 --> 37:50.061
I used to play it
for my children.

37:50.103 --> 37:52.647
How could you do this to Denae?
She trusted you.

37:52.689 --> 37:55.275
- And I trusted Denae to do
what was best for her child.

37:55.316 --> 37:58.111
I told her not to have
that baby on the reservation.

37:58.153 --> 38:00.780
A midwife with no resources
isn't equipped

38:00.822 --> 38:02.282
to deliver a breeched baby.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.993
So when she called me
from the highway in labor,

38:05.035 --> 38:08.288
I knew right then that she
was unfit to raise this child.

38:08.329 --> 38:11.124
I can give this baby
the right kind of life,

38:11.166 --> 38:14.252
the kind I was never able
to give my own.

38:14.294 --> 38:16.296
- You lost a child?

38:16.338 --> 38:20.592
- My wife had a...
precarious pregnancy.

38:20.633 --> 38:23.136
I told her, don't drive
in the final trimester.

38:23.178 --> 38:27.265
But she did anyway,
and she got into an accident.

38:27.307 --> 38:30.643
In one brief moment,

38:30.685 --> 38:33.897
I lost my wife and my child.

38:33.938 --> 38:36.358
* *

38:36.399 --> 38:37.859
Nobody listened to me.

38:37.901 --> 38:40.195
Not my wife, not Denae.

38:40.236 --> 38:42.989
Do you have any idea
what it feels like

38:43.031 --> 38:45.325
to hand baby after baby
over to new parents

38:45.367 --> 38:49.788
every delivery
and yet feel so empty?

38:49.829 --> 38:51.498
- I imagine it felt
like losing your child

38:51.539 --> 38:53.041
over and over again.

38:53.083 --> 38:54.668
- I don't begrudge these
new parents their happiness.

38:54.709 --> 38:56.503
They were fit parents.

38:56.544 --> 38:57.796
They listened to me.

38:57.837 --> 38:59.381
They relied on me,
unlike Denae.

38:59.422 --> 39:01.925
So when she called, I saw
an opportunity to take back

39:01.966 --> 39:03.468
that which was taken from me.

39:03.510 --> 39:06.846
I figured she'd die
from her birth wounds, so...

39:06.888 --> 39:09.891
I left her--

39:09.933 --> 39:11.768
right where she always
wanted to be,

39:11.810 --> 39:16.272
in the space between
the reservation and D.C.

39:16.314 --> 39:19.859

to lose a child.

39:19.901 --> 39:22.278
There's pain like no other.

39:22.320 --> 39:25.740
But Denae's life, nor her
baby's, is yours to take.

Against the wall!

[PentaXThe's "Strange Fields"]

Baby's OK.

on the ropes *

40:06.448 --> 40:07.699
- Is Dr. Potter--

40:07.741 --> 40:10.493

for a long time.

40:10.535 --> 40:12.412
[both sobbing]

40:12.454 --> 40:14.998
- Thank you all
for looking for me.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.416
For both of us.

40:16.458 --> 40:20.837

big brother.

40:46.071 --> 40:50.158
- I'm sorry
for holding on too tight.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.702
- It was out of love.

40:52.744 --> 40:56.081
But I'm done letting people
make decisions for me.

40:56.122 --> 40:57.665
I'm coming back
to the reservation

40:57.707 --> 40:59.334
to raise my daughter.

40:59.376 --> 41:01.586
I want her to grow up
around her tribe

41:01.628 --> 41:04.464
and know that part of her
can never be taken.
