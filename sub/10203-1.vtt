03:20.520 --> 03:23.126
<i>I come tonight to warn
you that you will be</i>

03:23.200 --> 03:25.806
<i>visited by three spirits.</i>

03:26.040 --> 03:27.041
<i>What?</i>

03:28.280 --> 03:32.365
<i>Was that the chance and hope
that you mentioned, Jacob?</i>

03:32.480 --> 03:33.766
<i>It was.</i>

03:33.840 --> 03:38.209
<i>And you have yet the chance
and hope of escaping my fate.</i>

03:38.320 --> 03:41.722
<i>A chance and hope
of my procuring, Ebenezer.</i>

03:41.800 --> 03:43.802
<i>Thank you, Jacob.</i>

03:43.880 --> 03:49.091
<i>Expect the first
when the bell tolls 1:00.</i>

03:49.160 --> 03:50.160
Shut up, Beth!

03:50.200 --> 03:52.965
I don't care who
started it, Max.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.407
Ben Kuklinski started it
and everybody knows it.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.845
You even have
the whole thing on video.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.081
And you're gonna
write an apology

03:58.160 --> 04:00.481
to the rest of your class
for ruining the recital.

04:00.560 --> 04:01.561
What were you
thinking, Max?

04:01.640 --> 04:03.244
That kid was
twice your size.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.051
Yeah, but Ben Kuklinski
is always ragging on Christmas.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.207
He even told
the first graders

04:07.280 --> 04:08.930
that Santa was just
a cheap marketing ploy

04:09.000 --> 04:10.240
invented to sell Pepsi.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.970
Coke.
You know what I mean.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.610
But not why you care.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.091
Well, someone's got to.

04:15.160 --> 04:18.164
Here, let me see.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.083
Eh, it's not so bad.
Just keep icing it.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.686
And was dropkicking
him into the manger

04:22.760 --> 04:24.603
really the best way
to handle this?

04:24.680 --> 04:27.126
Okay, that was not my fault.
I was under the influence.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.127
All I had to eat was Christmas
fudge and candy canes.

04:30.440 --> 04:31.646
Well, I hate
to sound harsh,

04:31.720 --> 04:33.529
but every kid has to
learn the truth someday.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.404
Oh, I know. I just...

04:37.120 --> 04:38.406
I didn't want it ruined.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.929
For the little kids.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.441
<i>But is this
a war on Christmas,</i>

04:43.520 --> 04:45.090
<i>a war on
over-political correctness...</i>

04:45.160 --> 04:46.207
Looks great, Mom.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.680
<i>...or a bunch of people who are
just way too easily offended?</i>

04:48.800 --> 04:49.847
Don't work too hard,
though. Sarah bought

04:49.880 --> 04:51.882
a bunch of cookies at the store.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.644
It's Roger.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.370
Thought you said you weren't
working over Christmas?

04:55.480 --> 04:56.891
I said no traveling
over Christmas.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.928
I still have to
take a few calls.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.365
Hey, Roger, what's up?

05:00.440 --> 05:02.283
Wait, guys, aren't we still gonna
watch <i>Charlie Brown</i>

05:02.400 --> 05:04.402
and wrap Christmas
presents like always?

05:04.480 --> 05:06.847
You know what? After what you pulled,
you can do that alone.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.968
And quick. Your cousins get
here any minute.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.246
Yeah, Roger.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.368
It's a Christmas
cluster-eff over here.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.283
Beth, help me hang this.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.007
Wait, Mom, aren't we gonna
watch <i>Charlie Brown?</i>

05:32.160 --> 05:33.321
I started,

05:33.400 --> 05:36.051
but I don't know what
to ask for this year.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.727
Because they are family, Beth.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.165
And it's only
for a few days.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.880
Well, I'm not sharing my
room with girls who pee standing up.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.002
Last year I found
shit in my bed, Mom.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.241
Human shit.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.129
For the last time,
that was their dog!

05:52.200 --> 05:54.202
"They're why some people shouldn't
be allowed to breed!"

05:54.280 --> 05:56.601
Your words,
Mom, not mine!

05:56.680 --> 05:58.648
I never said that!

05:59.280 --> 06:01.760
I said maybe they
should have to take a test

06:01.880 --> 06:03.120
before they're
allowed to breed.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.321
Thanks, Omi.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.084
Omi?
Hmm?

06:34.240 --> 06:36.242
Do you still
really believe in Santa?

06:46.760 --> 06:48.728
What do you mean?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.201
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:21.320 --> 07:23.402
My cousins are crawling out of
the shallow end of the gene pool,

07:23.520 --> 07:25.522
so everyone's
a little on edge.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.250
<i>Your mom popping Xanax again?</i>

07:27.320 --> 07:29.129
Like candy.

07:29.200 --> 07:33.205
Tonight we're making a Japanese snowflake
tree or some crap.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.491
Takes a lot of work
to make our family

07:35.600 --> 07:37.364
look more awesome than it
actually is, you know?

07:37.440 --> 07:38.680
<i>I like snowflakes,</i>

07:38.760 --> 07:41.161
<i>but I like my plan
a lot better.</i>

07:41.480 --> 07:46.361
Very enticing,
but I think I'm stuck here.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.521
<i>Come on,</i>

07:47.600 --> 07:50.570
<i>people have escaped from Alcatraz before,
and I'm only four blocks away.</i>

07:53.240 --> 07:55.288
<i>What? What's wrong?</i>

07:55.680 --> 07:57.444
Everything.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.368
Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.003
Will you two knock it off?

08:15.080 --> 08:16.491
Howie, stop
ringing the doorbell!

08:16.600 --> 08:18.125
- Well, carry something!
- Howie, cut it out!

08:18.200 --> 08:19.960
- Help me with the bags.
- Dad, you carry it.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.766
It's Christmas. It's Christmas.
It's Christmas.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.571
Merry Christmas!

08:25.640 --> 08:27.688
Hey, sis. Merry Christmas.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.001
Oh, gosh, I'm so glad
you guys could make it.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.366
You have no idea.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.804
Accidents all
over the freeways,

08:32.919 --> 08:33.921
and nothing but
crazy talk radio

08:34.000 --> 08:35.160
for six hours.
Mmm.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.044
Hey. We brought you a little taste
of home, though, didn't we?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.010
Oh, wow.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.451
Thank you. It looks...

08:40.520 --> 08:41.601
Wow.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.289
- You're welcome.
- Come on, Linda, move it, move it.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.124
We don't have to keep
the traffic jam going now.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.440
Howard, let me help you.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.406
- It's all right, Tom.
- Thanks, Tommy.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.481
Sorry about that.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.324
What, you give the butler
the night off, did you?

08:53.400 --> 08:54.680
Tom,
don't worry about it.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.728
Yeah,
we uh, brought Rosie.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.165
You don't have
a cat, do you?

08:58.360 --> 08:59.771
It's fine.
It's fine, right?

08:59.840 --> 09:00.887
It's fine.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.644
Merry Christmas, girls.
Come on in.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.604
Don't you look cute in
your matching jackets.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.806
They're just
a little cranky

09:06.880 --> 09:08.609
because the
Steelers lost, so...

09:08.680 --> 09:09.681
Uh, Jordan, Stevie,

09:09.800 --> 09:11.040
why don't you
tell your Aunt Sarah

09:11.120 --> 09:13.726
about your Presidential
Fitness Award, huh?

09:14.960 --> 09:17.201
It's a good story.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.846
Hey, Howie.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.450
So, what did you ask
Santa for this year?

09:23.520 --> 09:25.600
- Really nice.
- They did look pretty good.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.244
It looks
bigger in here.

09:27.320 --> 09:28.526
Toy car?

09:28.600 --> 09:30.489
Look what Max has got in his pocket.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.050
A letter to Santa.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.646
Video games?

09:36.840 --> 09:37.841
Phone?

09:39.360 --> 09:40.850
Dialysis?

09:43.160 --> 09:45.527
- That long fucking drive.
- Thank you, guys.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.450
Where do you
want this stuff, Tom?

09:47.520 --> 09:49.090
- Just anywhere?
- Yeah.

09:49.160 --> 09:52.448
Christ on a stick,
would it kill you to shovel your walk?

09:52.520 --> 09:54.443
I could've broken
a hip out there.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.409
Surprise!

09:56.480 --> 09:57.891
Please don't be mad.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.289
Oh, Aunt Dorothy,
it's so great to see you.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.045
Yeah, well, your
sister's no Mother Teresa,

10:06.200 --> 10:08.646
but at least she swings by

10:08.720 --> 10:10.800
every once in a while to
make sure that I'm not dead.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.530
So, where's the nog?

10:13.600 --> 10:15.409
I need to get merry.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.760
Uh, It's in the kitchen.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.001
Help yourself.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.162
Oh, Tom, let me
take that. I'm sorry.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.287
That's okay.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.805
Lord Almighty.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.360
Looks like Martha Stewart
threw up in here.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.648
- We left the door open. Sorry about that.
- No. No, no, no.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.882
We're such a mess, honestly.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.531
Six hours, I mean, come on.
Uh...

10:32.600 --> 10:34.887
Sorry, wasn't
there another...

10:35.520 --> 10:36.521
Mmm?

10:37.160 --> 10:38.366
Child?

10:38.760 --> 10:40.250
Chrissy! Darn it!

10:40.400 --> 10:41.920
Jordan, I told you
to bring her inside!

10:42.400 --> 10:43.401
Not my kid.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.527
Come on, girls.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.806
Tommy, help me
get the baby

10:45.880 --> 10:47.211
and the rest of the girl
crap out of the truck.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.441
Do you mind?
Thank you.

10:48.520 --> 10:49.601
All right.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.001
Let's make
some memories, huh?

10:52.120 --> 10:55.044
Thank you, honey.
Thank you. Oh, my goodness.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.248
A holiday roast
is a surprise.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.731
Hemorrhoids are a surprise.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.565
She is a goddamn nightmare.
What were you thinking?

11:01.720 --> 11:03.848
Come on, she's not that bad.
Oh.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.081
She's not!

11:05.160 --> 11:06.844
Besides, she
tricked me, okay?

11:06.920 --> 11:08.490
I thought we were
just dropping off gifts,

11:08.560 --> 11:10.160
and she came to the door
with a suitcase.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.811
What was I supposed to do?
Tell her she has to spend Christmas by herself?

11:12.880 --> 11:14.848
No, but at least you
could have warned me

11:14.920 --> 11:17.571
when one of your mistakes
is gonna become my problem.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.529
You think everything I do
is a mistake.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.050
Sorry.
Look out. Look out.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.321
Hey, honey.
Ooh. Oh.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.004
I think this
warhead's armed.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.849
Wow, you're so stinky.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.729
Okay, I'm gonna
go change her.

11:29.800 --> 11:30.801
Let's go this way.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.201
Just set that up wherever
you want, T.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.361
The whole truck
smells like shit.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.405
So, what's for dinner?

11:53.800 --> 11:55.564
That's my boy!

11:55.640 --> 11:56.971
That's my boy!

11:57.440 --> 11:59.090
It sure is.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.128
I'm getting Howie Junior
into game shape.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.651
By the time he gets
to high school,

12:02.720 --> 12:05.724
he's gonna be the biggest
lineman in the state.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.283
Did you ever spend any time
on the field, Tommy?

12:09.360 --> 12:11.647
No, actually,
I didn't have time in my younger years.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.131
I was in training mostly.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.800
What were you
training for? Uh...

12:15.120 --> 12:16.884
Army? Marines?

12:18.440 --> 12:19.726
It was the Eagle Scouts.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.486
Eagle Scouts.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.048
Now, Eagle Scouts, kids,

12:24.160 --> 12:25.924
that's where you weave baskets

12:26.000 --> 12:27.445
and help little old ladies
across the street.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.244
Am I right?
No, no.

12:29.600 --> 12:33.525
No, no, no. It was actually
quite a bit of survival training.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.481
So...

12:35.560 --> 12:38.530
Well, the only survival training
I need is my ol' smoke pole,

12:39.040 --> 12:40.769
and a big, fat
box of buckshot

12:40.840 --> 12:42.569
that I keep out
in that truck.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.531
A shepherd has got
to protect his flock.

12:45.960 --> 12:49.282
Honey, we said no gun talk
at the dinner table.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.244
This family needs
a little gun talk,

12:51.320 --> 12:53.402
whether it's at the dinner table,
or anywhere else.

12:53.480 --> 12:54.800
- Wow.
- You know what I'm saying?

12:54.840 --> 12:57.000
Looks like Chrissy's
really enjoying my gravlax.

12:58.840 --> 12:59.841
Careful, kids.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.280
Remember that
your Aunt Sarah likes

13:01.320 --> 13:02.526
everything to be
clean and perfect,

13:02.600 --> 13:05.206
and that's why she makes so
much food that you can't pronounce.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.644
Well, I just thought
you guys might like a break

13:07.720 --> 13:09.609
from macaroni and cheese
with hot dogs.

13:09.680 --> 13:10.761
Yeah, okay.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.565
Well, you were wrong.

13:12.640 --> 13:15.041
And who doesn't make
a ham at Christmas?

13:15.160 --> 13:17.049
What are you now, a Jew?

13:21.200 --> 13:23.043
Maybe it's time
for dessert, hmm?

13:23.840 --> 13:25.365
It's delicious, honey.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.680
It's a little dry.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.728
Okay. Well, mine's delicious.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.240
Well, I guess
I should've gotten your bird.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.520
You can just say
something nice.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.767
I'll say it
when she gets back, if dessert's good.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.365
Well, if you could
just do me a favor.

13:38.440 --> 13:41.284
- Tell him about Santa.
- Just say something nice about dessert.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.283
Hey, Maxi-Pad.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.004
Hear what happened to Santa?

13:45.120 --> 13:47.600
No, Stevie.
What happened to Santa?

13:47.800 --> 13:49.290
Heard it on the news.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.362
His sleigh
crashed in the Rockies.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.727
Shattered both his legs.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.565
Frostbite took care of his pain,
but not his hunger.

13:56.760 --> 14:00.242
So, to survive,
he had to slaughter and eat his reindeer.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.211
Including Rudolph.

14:05.280 --> 14:09.285
"Ate" tiny reindeer.
Get it?

14:09.760 --> 14:11.330
Knock it off!

14:11.400 --> 14:13.004
Don't start anything.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.565
Hey, guys, take it easy.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.367
They're
just playing, Tommy.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.645
Macaroni and cheese
and hot dogs.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.848
Oh, Jesus.

14:26.920 --> 14:30.766
So, what kind of godforsaken
concoction are you whipping up now?

14:30.840 --> 14:34.447
You know how this fancy
food clogs my pipes.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.886
Well, how about we
go to your trailer

14:35.960 --> 14:37.291
for Christmas
next year, hmm?

14:37.920 --> 14:41.242
And after you've spent weeks
decorating and cooking and cleaning,

14:41.320 --> 14:43.084
I might just waddle in and start
bitching and moaning

14:43.160 --> 14:44.800
about everything
you've worked so hard on.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.166
Oh, Sarah, you know...

14:46.280 --> 14:47.964
No, Aunt Dorothy, please.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.451
For your sake,

14:50.800 --> 14:52.564
just stay the hell
out of my kitchen.

14:55.800 --> 14:56.881
You know, reindeer
are actually

14:57.000 --> 14:58.889
a sustainable
food source

14:59.000 --> 15:01.970
in the Northern Territories
and Alaska. Canada.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.690
This time of year

15:03.840 --> 15:08.846
we refer to reindeer as a transportation
system for Santa Claus.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.930
We know you still believe
in the big, fat creeper.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.004
I don't know what
you're talking about.

15:15.720 --> 15:16.926
You sure about that?

15:18.760 --> 15:20.125
Max, stop.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.411
"Dear Santa,

15:24.160 --> 15:27.687
"I know I haven't been great this year,
and I'm sorry for that,

15:27.760 --> 15:29.489
"but I was really
hoping you could help out

15:29.560 --> 15:31.688
"me and my family
this Christmas.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.171
"We need you."

15:33.240 --> 15:34.605
Oh, Maxi-Pad,
that's so sweet.

15:34.680 --> 15:35.727
Give it back!

15:35.800 --> 15:37.450
Stop, Max.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.761
Blah, blah,
blah, bullshit, bullshit.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.808
Ah. Here we go,
Maxi's wish list.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.041
Stevie, stop.
That's enough.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.804
Wait, you're up first, Beth.

15:44.920 --> 15:48.481
"I wish me and Beth could
hang out like we used to.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.484
"You might have noticed that
I don't have tons of friends."

15:51.560 --> 15:53.847
Oh, no, really, Max?

15:54.280 --> 15:57.807
"I wish my mom and dad
could fall in love again.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.170
"I know they get
upset a lot,

16:00.240 --> 16:02.049
"with Dad away
from home so much.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.120
"I think they really just miss each other.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.882
"Also, I wish things
weren't so hard

16:09.960 --> 16:12.566
"for Uncle Howard
and Aunt Linda.

16:15.360 --> 16:19.081
"So, maybe you can lend them
a hand the rest of the year, too.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.000
"And...

16:23.760 --> 16:24.807
"And that..."

16:24.920 --> 16:27.924
Screw you! Dad does
not wish we were boys!

16:28.160 --> 16:30.811
Okay. Who wants
crème brûlée?

16:35.360 --> 16:37.124
Give me the letter! Give me it back!

16:37.200 --> 16:38.200
Hey, Max.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.447
Hey.

16:40.560 --> 16:41.800
- Hey!
- Girls!

16:45.520 --> 16:46.521
Hey! Hey!

16:47.360 --> 16:49.010
Come on, Howard.
Stevie, Jordan.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.080
Come on.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.645
All right,
all right, that's enough.

16:51.720 --> 16:52.960
Are you okay? Honey?

16:55.400 --> 16:57.920
I just wanted Christmas
to be like it used to be, but forget it.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.086
I hate Christmas!

16:59.160 --> 17:00.605
I hate all of you!

17:00.680 --> 17:03.126
Max. Max!

17:03.880 --> 17:05.369
Oh, lay off of him.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.965
Kid deserves a prize
just for telling the truth.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.282
- Can I come in?
- No.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.126
You know,
they're leaving right after Christmas,

17:25.200 --> 17:28.966
so we only have to survive
another three days.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.280
I don't get it.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.044
Every year it gets worse.

17:32.120 --> 17:35.966
Why do we have to put up with
their crap just because we share DNA?

17:37.520 --> 17:41.241
Because that's what
a family is, Max.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.243
People you try to
be friends with,

17:43.320 --> 17:45.687
even though you don't have
a whole lot in common.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.449
But why?
Because...

17:48.800 --> 17:50.211
Well...

17:51.760 --> 17:54.161
Okay, you kind of
got me there.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.281
Or maybe it makes us
work a little harder

17:58.360 --> 18:00.840
to find what we do have
in common, you know?

18:01.280 --> 18:04.602
Put everything aside,
think of other people for a change.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.331
Friends, family,

18:07.440 --> 18:09.681
even the assholes
you normally can't stand.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.131
Like Uncle Howard?

18:11.200 --> 18:12.850
Didn't wanna name names.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.851
Dad, do you really
believe in all that?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.002
I want to, Max.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.889
But, hey,
bet there's still time

18:27.000 --> 18:29.526
to drop that letter
in the mailbox, huh?

20:26.800 --> 20:28.086
Don't you find it
the least bit strange?

20:28.160 --> 20:29.764
I mean, they can see
dust specks on Mars,

20:29.840 --> 20:32.684
but no one noticed a giant
blizzard hurtling towards us.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.569
Well, as soon
as the power's back,

20:34.640 --> 20:36.085
you can write
an angry e-mail

20:36.160 --> 20:37.605
to the National
Weather Service.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.967
But in the meantime,
let's just try and stay calm.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.565
Mom, there's
something weird outside.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.766
I am calm.

20:42.840 --> 20:43.966
I would just be
calmer if I knew

20:44.040 --> 20:45.087
how we were gonna
survive Christmas

20:45.160 --> 20:46.446
with 12 people
stuck in a house

20:46.520 --> 20:49.763
with no hot water,
no heat, and no electricity.

20:49.840 --> 20:50.921
Or food.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.571
Well, there's plenty
of leftovers, Howard.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.845
Beer it is.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.251
Phone's dead, too.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.680
Mom!
What, Max?

20:58.760 --> 21:00.842
There's a snowman
in our yard.

21:02.840 --> 21:04.285
See?

21:06.520 --> 21:09.251
That's... That's great, Max.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.606
But who built it?

21:10.680 --> 21:11.761
You can barely see
across the street,

21:11.840 --> 21:15.208
but it doesn't look
like it's just us.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.930
I can walk over,
check with the Turners.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.650
The Turners
are in Hawaii.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.131
The Lamberts
are in Florida,

21:20.200 --> 21:21.486
and the Cartwrights
stopped talking to us

21:21.560 --> 21:23.801
after Max's
noodle incident.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.120
After his what?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.964
Max, please go and get Omi
out of the fireplace

21:27.040 --> 21:29.042
before she burns
the whole house down.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.131
I'll get it!

21:33.200 --> 21:34.964
Fine.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.724
Seriously,
what are we gonna do?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.041
Merry Christmas.
Whoa!

21:39.120 --> 21:41.487
Sign here.
Yeah.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.561
Wow.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.686
Honey, stuff to carry.

21:45.760 --> 21:46.966
Some weather, huh?

21:47.040 --> 21:48.929
Yeah, it's a ghost town
out there.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.161
Roads are a nightmare.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.287
Yeah, no kidding.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.404
Hey, these, too?

21:53.520 --> 21:54.521
Uh, not mine.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.041
- Uh, must be from the boys in brown.
- All right.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.168
Merry Christmas.
Yeah, you, too.

21:59.640 --> 22:00.766
What is it?

22:00.880 --> 22:02.245
Hey, look at this, huh?

22:02.320 --> 22:03.560
What?

22:03.640 --> 22:05.130
They got more stuff.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.163
Man, how come rich people
get all the free shit?

22:07.240 --> 22:09.288
I don't know, honey.
Democrats, probably.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.290
Oh, my God!

22:14.560 --> 22:16.767
- Argh!
- Who needs this much cheese?

22:17.280 --> 22:19.521
It's one
singular moment.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.284
You guys, I've texted Derek,
like, nine times,

22:21.400 --> 22:22.970
and he still
hasn't written back.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.530
That is not normal.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.841
It's the blizzard, honey.
Nothing's working right now.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.490
Then can I walk over
and check on him?

22:28.920 --> 22:30.206
It's only a few blocks.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.647
I don't think
that's a good idea.

22:32.760 --> 22:34.649
Well, I could see if anyone else
has power on the way.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.604
She'll be fine.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.523
Okay. One hour.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.170
But when you get back,
I want you to spend

22:41.240 --> 22:42.720
some girl time with
Jordan and Stevie.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.046
Got it?

22:44.120 --> 22:46.202
You call that
a reversal?

22:46.280 --> 22:48.328
Come on, Jordy,
plant your feet!

22:48.440 --> 22:49.441
Plant your feet.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.640
All right. Here we go.
Right.

22:50.680 --> 22:52.603
Again.
You know what I mean.

22:52.680 --> 22:53.681
Thanks.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.205
Be careful, okay?

22:55.280 --> 22:56.406
Okay. Back later.

22:56.520 --> 22:59.046
Love you. One hour.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.451
Okay.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.611
Max, I told you to
get Omi out of the...

23:17.640 --> 23:19.642
She says hot chocolate
makes everything better.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.685
Oh, my God.

24:49.680 --> 24:50.681
Please!

24:57.240 --> 24:59.083
Somebody help me!

24:59.600 --> 25:00.931
Please!

27:27.760 --> 27:28.921
Get anything?

27:29.880 --> 27:31.086
No.

27:33.120 --> 27:34.849
It's the weirdest thing.
There's no cars,

27:34.920 --> 27:37.924
no people,
not even a salt truck.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.606
Don't suppose
you got me

27:40.720 --> 27:43.121
a backup generator
for Christmas, did you?

27:43.200 --> 27:47.046
Yeah, it's under the tree,
next to your ties and underwear.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.406
Good.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.250
It's getting late.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.565
Beth should be home by now.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.881
She's fine.
She's at Derek's.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.530
All the more
reason to worry.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.923
Hey, hon, relax.
Just for once. Okay?

28:08.600 --> 28:11.285
How's everybody else doing?

28:11.400 --> 28:14.882
You know, cranky, bored,

28:14.960 --> 28:16.769
sick of the snow.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.126
And each other.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.361
'Tis the season.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.249
Oh, God, I miss us.

28:28.680 --> 28:30.205
Me, too.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.965
Mom, Dad.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.841
It's already dark out
and Beth isn't back yet.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.001
Hey, Howard.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.243
Do you think your Hummer
could get through this mess?

28:55.320 --> 28:56.890
Lucinda?

28:56.960 --> 28:58.849
I could point her
due east, hit the gas,

28:58.920 --> 29:01.890
and she'd be storming the beaches
at Normandy by sunrise.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.086
What's on your mind, T?

29:03.160 --> 29:04.241
Well, it's Beth.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.765
She went to her
boyfriend's earlier

29:05.840 --> 29:07.080
and she hasn't
come back yet.

29:07.160 --> 29:08.400
See?

29:08.680 --> 29:12.241
Let them out of your sight for one second,
and boom, shotgun wedding.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.527
Aunt Dorothy, please.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.165
Well, you ought to know.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.810
It's probably nothing.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.241
But I thought
we'd go pick her up,

29:20.360 --> 29:21.600
take a quick swing
around town,

29:21.680 --> 29:22.966
see what's
going on out there.

29:23.040 --> 29:24.166
A little recon mission, huh?

29:24.640 --> 29:25.971
Thought you'd never ask.

29:26.040 --> 29:27.246
Okay.

29:27.360 --> 29:28.885
Go to Mama.
Yep.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.086
All righty.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.527
Thomas. Thomas.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.484
What? Why?

29:36.560 --> 29:38.080
What the hell is
she so riled up about?

29:42.360 --> 29:43.691
She says not to go.

29:44.320 --> 29:47.160
That it's too dangerous, and that we
should wait until the storm's over.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.406
Tom.
No, I got this.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.086
Hey, Mom, we have to
go pick up Beth,

29:51.160 --> 29:54.243
but Max and Sarah will take
care of you while I'm gone. Okay?

29:54.360 --> 29:56.328
Mom. Hey, Mom, listen.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.930
Everything's gonna be okay.

30:24.680 --> 30:26.762
Global
warming, my ass.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.760
Must be -20 out here.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.002
This just
doesn't make any sense.

30:32.120 --> 30:34.327
You try AM?
Yeah, I tried everything.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.607
The storm probably knocked out
the radio stations, too.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.130
I guess so.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.482
What I wouldn't give for a little
Bing Crosby right about now.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.805
Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.450
What is that?

31:04.960 --> 31:06.200
Is that a snowplow?

31:16.640 --> 31:17.846
Hello?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.331
Christ.

31:43.720 --> 31:46.485
Poor bastard must have
sailed clear through.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.726
Looks more like
the opposite.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.245
What do you mean?

31:51.320 --> 31:53.322
The glass is
punched in.

32:07.640 --> 32:09.608
We gotta find Beth.

32:12.680 --> 32:16.162
You packed guns
on Christmas.

32:16.240 --> 32:18.607
Always be prepared,
Boy Scout.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.160
It's kind of heavy.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.401
Yeah.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.170
It's Linda's.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.280
Oh, my gosh.

32:39.640 --> 32:42.166
You had Mom's angel
this whole time?

32:42.240 --> 32:44.163
Yeah,
I thought you knew.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.730
No.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.841
Oh.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.847
Remember how we used to fight
over who got to place her?

32:51.920 --> 32:53.763
Yeah, and you fought dirty.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.201
I think I still have the scars.

32:56.280 --> 32:58.408
Where do you think
my girls get it from?

33:03.560 --> 33:06.450
Wow. You saved everything.

33:07.480 --> 33:08.481
Yeah.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.766
I figured that's what
Mom would have done, you know.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.240
Mom?

33:28.520 --> 33:30.090
Probably just squirrels.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.489
In this weather?

34:01.360 --> 34:02.646
See?

34:03.440 --> 34:04.805
- Squirrels.
- Right.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.802
Probably playing
with their nuts.

34:25.320 --> 34:26.525
Beth?

34:33.920 --> 34:35.364
Derek!

34:38.360 --> 34:39.360
Beth!

34:39.679 --> 34:42.047
Quiet, Tommy.
I don't like this.

35:05.040 --> 35:08.681
Whoever did this
is a demented son of a bitch.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.526
Don't worry.
We'll find her, buddy.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.565
Looks like a gas line blew.

35:43.480 --> 35:44.766
What's that?

35:49.720 --> 35:51.722
I've hunted
a lot of game in my day.

35:52.240 --> 35:53.810
Those are hooves.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.251
Big ones, too.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.082
Could be an elk or a goat.

35:58.160 --> 36:01.448
What kind of goat
walks on its hind legs?

36:07.280 --> 36:08.281
Beth!

36:10.280 --> 36:11.884
- Beth!
- Help me!

36:13.760 --> 36:15.410
Beth!

36:15.520 --> 36:16.806
Help!

36:19.320 --> 36:20.651
Beth!

36:22.840 --> 36:24.330
Beth!

36:25.760 --> 36:26.761
Beth!

36:26.840 --> 36:28.205
Tommy!

36:28.680 --> 36:29.920
Wait up!

36:40.440 --> 36:41.441
Howard!

36:47.800 --> 36:49.086
Oh, my God!

36:49.160 --> 36:50.764
Hold on, Howard!

36:50.840 --> 36:52.729
Help! Oh, God!

36:55.960 --> 36:57.007
Tommy!

36:59.360 --> 37:00.361
Something's biting me!

37:01.800 --> 37:03.290
Don't let go!

37:09.560 --> 37:10.721
Tommy?

37:22.080 --> 37:23.206
Let's go!

37:23.280 --> 37:24.645
What was that thing?

37:24.760 --> 37:27.331
I don't know,
but we have to move!

37:34.880 --> 37:37.087
Oh, my God.
Oh!

37:40.000 --> 37:41.764
Lucinda!

37:44.920 --> 37:47.207
Where do you
think you're going?

37:47.280 --> 37:48.691
To find them.
I don't like this.

37:48.800 --> 37:49.926
What are you talking about?

37:50.000 --> 37:51.923
Tom and Howard know
what they're doing. They're fine.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.202
- Are they?
- Mom?

37:54.480 --> 37:56.289
Honey, I'll be
right back. I promise.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.361
Just lock the door.

37:58.680 --> 38:01.411
Max, get the first aid kit!
Sarah, lock the door.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.640
Girls! Make some room for your dad!
Oh, my God!

38:03.680 --> 38:05.250
Get the door, shut the door!

38:05.320 --> 38:06.321
Where's Beth?

38:06.400 --> 38:07.401
We heard gunshots!

38:07.480 --> 38:08.811
I'll explain everything,

38:08.880 --> 38:11.451
but right now everybody just needs
to stay calm and stay inside!

38:11.520 --> 38:12.965
Get away
from the windows!

38:13.040 --> 38:15.964
Swords, guns, knives, pots, pans,
get whatever you can...

38:16.040 --> 38:17.485
Howard!
What?

38:17.880 --> 38:19.484
Not here.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.121
Jiminy Christmas.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.202
What happened out there?

38:24.360 --> 38:25.361
Nothing.

38:25.560 --> 38:26.766
It's just a scratch.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.091
Oh, my God. it looks
like something bit you!

38:29.200 --> 38:30.486
Nope.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.847
Probably a bear trap
under the snow or something.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.285
We don't have bears here.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.244
Okay. Um...

38:39.400 --> 38:40.811
Kids, why don't you
go into the kitchen

38:40.920 --> 38:42.490
and get something
to eat now, okay?

38:42.560 --> 38:44.369
You just don't wanna tell us
what's really going on here!

38:44.440 --> 38:46.841
Everybody, in the kitchen right now, Max!
Okay? Right now.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.960
Come on, let's go.
Girls. Come on. It's okay.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.843
Aunt Dorothy, will you
keep an eye on them?

38:51.920 --> 38:53.001
Why me?

38:53.080 --> 38:55.560
I never liked kids,
even when I was one.

38:57.880 --> 38:58.927
Please.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.921
Oh, all right. All right!

39:03.400 --> 39:04.765
Come on, guys,
I'm gonna teach you

39:04.840 --> 39:06.968
how to make
peppermint schnapps.

39:09.960 --> 39:11.803
Mom.

39:12.280 --> 39:16.126
Mom. Will you please go into
the kitchen and help with the kids?

39:25.280 --> 39:27.123
Come here, baby.

39:29.520 --> 39:33.366
See?
A little sugar and a little spice

39:35.840 --> 39:38.491
makes everything nice.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.081
Mmm.

39:46.360 --> 39:51.127
All right.
But don't you rat me out.

39:53.320 --> 39:56.403
But who
or what did all this?

39:57.360 --> 39:59.283
Your guess
is as good as mine.

40:00.840 --> 40:03.160
First I thought it was a gang thing,

40:04.120 --> 40:06.600
but between this and all the
crazy stuff we saw out there,

40:06.680 --> 40:08.205
it just doesn't add up.

40:08.400 --> 40:10.243
It could be
terrorists, right?

40:10.320 --> 40:11.446
Yeah, terrorists.

40:11.520 --> 40:14.091
Maybe traded their suicide vests
for rabid snow dogs?

40:14.160 --> 40:15.810
Tommy!

40:15.880 --> 40:17.325
Tom, God!
Sorry. Sorry.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.450
Um...

40:20.840 --> 40:21.921
And Beth?

40:22.000 --> 40:24.844
Okay. She wasn't at Derek's,
but that doesn't mean anything.

40:24.920 --> 40:26.081
She may have
found somewhere safe.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.241
So, she's still out there.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.169
Yes. And we will
find her, I promise.

40:29.280 --> 40:31.806
But I had to make sure you guys were safe.
I had to get Howard back...

40:31.880 --> 40:33.291
I don't care how
long it takes, Tom.

40:33.360 --> 40:34.486
We have to keep looking.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.369
We have to pair up and take turns...
Yes.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.522
We can't go back out there!
You see this?

40:38.600 --> 40:39.840
It's damn near frostbite.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.001
In under four minutes!

40:41.080 --> 40:42.241
Honey, keep
your voice down.

40:42.320 --> 40:44.129
Besides it being
sub-zero out there,

40:44.200 --> 40:46.407
someone's tearing through your
fancy-ass neighborhood

40:46.480 --> 40:47.481
picking everybody off.

40:47.560 --> 40:48.800
It's the truth!

40:48.880 --> 40:51.042
Honey, sweetheart.
Listen, why don't we just leave?

40:51.120 --> 40:52.770
Right? We can all
pile in the truck

40:52.840 --> 40:53.966
and we'll just see
as far as we can get,

40:54.040 --> 40:56.088
- and we pick up Beth...
- The truck's gone.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.366
Torn to pieces.

40:57.520 --> 40:58.601
- What?
- What?

40:58.680 --> 41:01.524
Yeah. And even if she wasn't,
the streets are totally screwed.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.001
We can't go anywhere.
It's too dangerous. You got it?

41:04.360 --> 41:05.964
Howard, how much ammo
do you have?

41:07.360 --> 41:09.727
A couple shells still loaded,
maybe a dozen in my pocket.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.131
Why?

41:11.200 --> 41:14.329
I think our best bet
is to stay put.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.289
Board up all
the doors and windows.

41:17.120 --> 41:19.361
And as soon as the weather breaks,
we'll go find her.

41:19.440 --> 41:20.965
I told you we should've
gone to my brother's.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.923
Sure, Howard.
Christmas on a pig farm.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.280
Jesus was born in a barn!

41:24.360 --> 41:25.441
Knock it
off, you guys!

41:25.520 --> 41:27.090
What about the kids?
What are we gonna tell them?

41:27.160 --> 41:28.446
I don't know. The truth?

41:28.520 --> 41:30.284
Sure. Which version of it?

41:31.160 --> 41:33.162
Hey, you guys.
Oh, God.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.890
How much
of that did you hear?

41:35.320 --> 41:36.731
Enough.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.882
Mama, did someone
take Beth?

41:38.960 --> 41:40.007
Are they coming for us?

41:40.080 --> 41:42.606
No. No, babies.
No, everything's fine.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.161
Beth's just with her
boyfriend, that's all.

41:45.960 --> 41:48.201
And nothing bad's gonna happen
on Christmas, right?

41:48.280 --> 41:51.011
You know what, let's have a campout, okay?
We'll watch a movie. Yeah?

41:51.080 --> 41:52.366
Let's get cozy
on the couch.

41:52.440 --> 41:53.487
Go get your
sister, Stevie.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.085
Come on, baby. Come on.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.850
We'll find her,
I promise.

42:02.760 --> 42:05.764
<i>"And lo, the angel
of the Lord came upon them.</i>

42:06.000 --> 42:08.606
<i>"And the glory of the Lord
shone round about them.</i>

42:08.680 --> 42:10.603
<i>"And they were so afraid.</i>

42:10.680 --> 42:12.682
<i>"And the angel said unto them,</i>

42:12.800 --> 42:15.451
<i>"'Fear not. For behold,
I bring you tidings of great joy..."'</i>

42:15.520 --> 42:17.966
Won't the battery die?

42:18.040 --> 42:19.804
Gotta die sometime.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.405
Might as well
enjoy it while we can.

42:25.720 --> 42:26.721
Hey.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.765
Beth's a tough girl.

42:31.160 --> 42:33.003
Takes after her mom.

42:34.080 --> 42:35.764
I'm sure she's fine.

42:36.360 --> 42:37.691
Thank you.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.240
Hey, Tommy.

42:47.840 --> 42:48.841
I, uh...

42:51.480 --> 42:53.562
I just wanna say
thanks for, you know,

42:55.600 --> 42:57.489
saving my ass back there.

42:58.320 --> 43:02.769
Oh, well, sure.
No problem.

43:08.880 --> 43:11.531
And I just wanna say
I'm sorry

43:12.840 --> 43:15.160
for thinking you're such a
spineless dick all these years.

43:18.680 --> 43:19.886
Yeah.

43:24.200 --> 43:25.531
You should get
some sleep, pal.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.205
How?

43:28.240 --> 43:29.651
Good point.

43:33.720 --> 43:34.721
Hey, Dad?

43:36.840 --> 43:38.080
Are we gonna die?

43:38.920 --> 43:40.888
Hey. No, no.

43:42.720 --> 43:43.767
No.

43:45.880 --> 43:47.564
Omi's been acting different.

43:48.920 --> 43:50.968
Ever since
the storm.

43:51.040 --> 43:53.327
Yeah, well,
you know,

43:56.680 --> 43:58.648
she always gets a little
weird around Christmas.

44:00.480 --> 44:01.606
How come?

44:01.880 --> 44:04.042
I don't know.
She never wanted to talk about it.

44:04.920 --> 44:06.490
Max. Come on.

44:06.880 --> 44:08.166
Time for bed.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.289
It's gonna be fine.

44:17.880 --> 44:19.086
All right.

44:33.960 --> 44:36.804
You know, Linda and I,
we butt heads,

44:38.520 --> 44:40.682
but I can't imagine
life without her.

44:43.640 --> 44:45.324
Yeah, I know what you mean.

44:46.640 --> 44:49.564
One of us should probably
stay up and keep watch.

44:50.800 --> 44:52.564
That's a good idea.
I'll go first.

44:52.640 --> 44:55.371
No. You go ahead and catch
some winks with your family.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.408
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

44:58.800 --> 45:00.802
A shepherd has got
to protect his flock.

45:02.920 --> 45:04.763
Night, Howard.
Good night.

48:14.960 --> 48:15.960
Howie!

48:16.000 --> 48:17.650
Dad! Dad!

48:19.640 --> 48:21.483
Hang on, Howie!

48:22.360 --> 48:23.361
Dad!

48:25.600 --> 48:27.648
Sarah!
Hold on, Sarah!

48:27.720 --> 48:30.803
- Mom!
- Call 911!

48:36.440 --> 48:37.965
Howie, hold on!

48:42.880 --> 48:43.881
Hold on!

48:53.240 --> 48:55.811
Max, get the
fire extinguisher!

48:56.560 --> 48:59.040
Help me! Help me! Help me!

48:59.120 --> 49:01.487
Sarah! I got you!

49:04.080 --> 49:05.650
Pull me down!

49:05.720 --> 49:06.881
I got you!

49:18.000 --> 49:19.001
Hey!

49:19.080 --> 49:20.127
No!

49:20.200 --> 49:21.531
Howie!

49:21.600 --> 49:22.601
No, no, no!

49:22.680 --> 49:25.570
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

49:39.680 --> 49:43.207
Honey? Are you okay?
Are you hurt? Hon?

49:46.320 --> 49:48.084
What unholy thing was that?

49:50.640 --> 49:52.404
Howard. Howard.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.286
It's my fault.
No.

49:56.360 --> 49:58.124
I fell asleep.

49:58.640 --> 50:00.881
And they got our boy.
It's all my fault.

50:11.720 --> 50:13.290
Tom, what's she saying?

50:14.120 --> 50:16.327
This is
all of our fault?

50:16.880 --> 50:18.928
He's come
for us all?

50:19.960 --> 50:21.644
He? Who?

50:21.720 --> 50:23.484
Who's he? I don't know.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.244
Mom, what are you
talking about?

50:25.320 --> 50:27.163
Please. Listen.

50:27.480 --> 50:29.721
English. I knew it.

50:30.640 --> 50:32.483
I must tell you something.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.764
To all of you.

50:37.200 --> 50:40.488
It started with the wind.

50:44.280 --> 50:48.126
<i>On a cold winter night,
much like this.</i>

50:49.720 --> 50:52.291
<i>It was almost Christmas.</i>

50:53.320 --> 50:58.201
<i>But this Christmas was darker.
Less cheerful.</i>

51:01.280 --> 51:04.170
<i>But I still
believed in Santa.</i>

51:05.600 --> 51:07.170
<i>In magic,</i>

51:07.960 --> 51:09.962
<i>and miracles.</i>

51:10.880 --> 51:14.851
<i>And the hope that we
could find joy again.</i>

51:16.680 --> 51:18.921
<i>But our village had given up.</i>

51:19.440 --> 51:22.250
<i>On miracles, and on each other.</i>

51:25.880 --> 51:28.531
<i>They had forgotten
the spirit of Christmas.</i>

51:29.320 --> 51:31.891
<i>The sacrifice of giving.</i>

51:34.240 --> 51:37.801
<i>And my family
was no different.</i>

51:41.480 --> 51:45.530
<i>I tried to help them
to believe again,</i>

51:45.640 --> 51:49.611
<i>but we were no longer
the loving family I remembered.</i>

51:53.160 --> 51:55.731
<i>They, too, had given up.</i>

51:57.280 --> 51:59.601
<i>And eventually, so did I.</i>

52:03.520 --> 52:08.287
<i>And for the first time,
I didn't wish for a miracle.</i>

52:09.680 --> 52:12.763
<i>I wished for them
to go away.</i>

52:14.120 --> 52:17.727
<i>A wish I would come to regret.</i>

52:20.360 --> 52:22.283
<i>And that night,</i>

52:22.360 --> 52:25.887
<i>in the darkness of
a howling blizzard,</i>

52:25.960 --> 52:28.531
<i>I got my wish.</i>

52:32.720 --> 52:37.647
<i>I knew Saint Nicholas
was not coming this year.</i>

52:40.520 --> 52:46.801
<i>Instead, it was a much darker,
more ancient spirit.</i>

52:50.120 --> 52:52.885
<i>The shadow of
Saint Nicholas.</i>

52:53.600 --> 52:56.001
<i>It was Krampus.</i>

52:58.120 --> 53:01.408
<i>And as he had for
thousands of years,</i>

53:02.400 --> 53:05.927
<i>Krampus came not to reward,
but to punish.</i>

53:06.720 --> 53:11.009
<i>Not to give, but to take.</i>

53:12.600 --> 53:15.046
<i>He and his helpers.</i>

53:18.720 --> 53:23.726
<i>I could only listen as they dragged
my family into the underworld,</i>

53:23.800 --> 53:27.805
<i>knowing that I would be next.</i>

53:29.360 --> 53:32.807
<i>But Krampus didn't
take me that night.</i>

53:35.480 --> 53:42.443
<i>He left me as a reminder
of what happens when hope is lost,</i>

53:42.520 --> 53:45.808
<i>when belief is forgotten,</i>

53:45.920 --> 53:48.810
<i>and the Christmas spirit dies.</i>

54:05.320 --> 54:07.163
And here I thought
I was the one losing it.

54:07.240 --> 54:09.527
Howard.
What?

54:09.680 --> 54:12.286
You believe this senile horseshit?
I don't know.

54:12.560 --> 54:15.291
Evil Santa?
Jesus H. Almighty.

54:15.920 --> 54:19.003
She'll be yammering about
a rabid Easter Bunny come Spring.

54:19.080 --> 54:20.081
Howard, that's enough.

54:24.080 --> 54:26.242
You damn right
it's enough.

54:26.320 --> 54:27.287
Whoever the hell's
messing with us

54:27.360 --> 54:29.442
took my boy
and your daughter,

54:29.520 --> 54:33.206
and we're sitting around
listening to some twisted bedtime story?

54:35.840 --> 54:37.205
Screw that.

54:37.280 --> 54:38.680
- I'm getting Howie back.
- Howard!

54:38.720 --> 54:40.131
Daddy? Daddy, don't go!
Howard, what are you doing?

54:40.200 --> 54:41.486
- Tommy, don't!
- Stay with us, please!

54:41.560 --> 54:42.920
- Don't, Tommy!
- Daddy, don't!

54:43.000 --> 54:44.001
Whoa!

54:46.280 --> 54:47.805
I'm starting to like you.

54:48.480 --> 54:49.720
I am.

54:50.400 --> 54:52.050
But this is my choice.

54:52.240 --> 54:53.366
Howard, what are you doing?

54:53.560 --> 54:56.484
We've got four
other kids here to protect.

54:56.560 --> 54:57.561
Howard.

54:57.640 --> 54:58.801
Baby, please don't do this.

54:58.880 --> 55:01.770
Listen, we can figure
something else out. Honey.

55:01.840 --> 55:04.446
This is how I
figure things out.

55:04.520 --> 55:05.567
Howard, you don't
wanna do this.

55:05.760 --> 55:06.921
Howard!

55:14.480 --> 55:15.561
Howie!

55:21.360 --> 55:23.931
Howie!

55:27.400 --> 55:28.970
No, shut the door!

55:29.040 --> 55:30.769
Inside! Shut it!

55:39.880 --> 55:41.530
Don't open the door.

55:43.200 --> 55:44.440
Dad?

55:45.520 --> 55:46.806
What are we gonna do now?

55:47.920 --> 55:49.809
We keep the fire hot.

56:20.640 --> 56:23.803
But what if you've
been good, like, all year?

56:24.800 --> 56:26.529
And you leave out
milk and cookies,

56:26.600 --> 56:27.720
and do everything
else right?

56:39.720 --> 56:41.085
It's not what you do.

56:41.520 --> 56:43.648
It's what you believe.

56:44.040 --> 56:45.929
And what you've
given up

56:46.240 --> 56:47.571
in here.

56:49.120 --> 56:51.361
But can't we
make him go away?

56:57.640 --> 56:59.244
What's she saying?

56:59.320 --> 57:00.731
I'm not sure.

57:00.800 --> 57:02.006
She says we're fucked.

57:03.680 --> 57:04.681
Eh.

57:05.240 --> 57:06.446
How did you...

57:06.520 --> 57:08.488
Because I'm old enough
to know when life is coming at you

57:08.560 --> 57:10.085
with his pants down.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.048
Hey.

57:32.840 --> 57:36.731
When they took Howie,
what did you see up there?

57:39.360 --> 57:42.330
You believe
that story, right?

57:43.680 --> 57:44.841
Do you?

57:45.520 --> 57:47.568
I don't know
what I believe anymore.

57:48.240 --> 57:50.766
I know I'm going out there
to find Beth. I have to.

57:50.880 --> 57:52.520
I don't even care if I die trying.
I know.

57:52.560 --> 57:56.167
Listen. Let's get Howard
and Linda. I have an idea.

58:48.360 --> 58:49.600
Linda.

58:51.600 --> 58:53.443
Can we talk with you
and Howard for a minute?

58:53.600 --> 58:55.090
Can it wait?

58:56.040 --> 58:58.441
I just wanna get
these rewrapped for the kids.

58:59.800 --> 59:01.484
It's important.

59:01.600 --> 59:02.726
The snowplow?

59:02.800 --> 59:05.531
The keys were in the
ignition and it was beat to hell.

59:05.600 --> 59:07.807
But if it runs,
I drive it back here,

59:07.880 --> 59:10.042
then everyone
piles in the car

59:10.120 --> 59:13.329
and follows, while I clear
a path in front of us.

59:13.400 --> 59:15.607
And go where?

59:15.680 --> 59:17.887
The mall doubles
as an emergency shelter.

59:17.960 --> 59:20.725
And if it's empty,
we'll try the police station.

59:20.800 --> 59:23.007
And what if
they're gone, too?

59:23.120 --> 59:27.125
Then we keep driving
till we see lights or people,

59:27.200 --> 59:29.487
plowed road,
somewhere safe for the kids.

59:29.560 --> 59:31.289
And then we
bring help back here.

59:31.640 --> 59:33.369
For Beth and Howie.

59:33.560 --> 59:36.131
You're not thinking of going
for the plow by yourself, are you?

59:38.560 --> 59:41.484
Well, shepherd has got
to protect his flock.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.640
I can't believe you're
afraid to come up here by yourself.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.923
It's not my fault
Aunt Dorothy clogged up the crapper.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.646
Hey, Stevie?

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.846
Yeah?

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.971
Do you think
they took Howie

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.646
because of the time
we painted the cats?

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.290
I don't know, Jordan.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.844
Do you think he's dead?

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.845
I don't know.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.927
<i>Jordan?</i>

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.365
<i>Stevie?</i>

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.447
Beth?

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.561
Beth, you up there?

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.641
<i>Stevie? Jordan?</i>

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.324
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.563
Where have you been?
Everyone's freaking out.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.608
<i>Come up here
and I'll show you.</i>

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.451
<i>I've been
waiting for you guys.</i>

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:18.766
<i>Hurry.</i>

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.405
Have you told Max yet?

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.569
No. Not yet.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:26.961
Jordan?

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.721
Stevie!

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.683
Where are they?
Where did they go?

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.046
They were just here.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.849
I think they went
to the bathroom.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.200
And you just let them go?

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.770
Was there another option?

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.887
Jordan!

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.962
Stevie? Jordan?
Linda.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:46.881
Listen.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.051
Honey, who is that?

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.444
Howard, stay here.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.486
Omi?
Hmm?

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.004
I think all this
might be my fault.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.801
Uncle Howard?

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.601
Rosie.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.206
Come here, girl.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.163
Useless turd.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.882
All right, wait here.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.600
Jordan?

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.365
Stevie?

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.763
Okay. Okay.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.131
Jordan.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.247
Stevie?

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.289
You guys.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.731
The hell is this?

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.525
God damn it.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.604
It's okay.
I got you.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.964
You're gonna be okay.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.807
What...

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.324
Oh, come on!

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:14.840
Hey!

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.803
Oh, my God!

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.163
- No!
- Jordan! No!

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.765
Oh, my God!

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.524
Shoot it, Tom!
Shoot it!

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.170
For God's sake,
shoot it!

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:35.921
Linda!

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.084
We should have
gone to my brother's.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.165
Where did it go?
I don't know!

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.571
Oh, my God.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.761
Ow!

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.287
- Bear!
- What?

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.689
Bear!

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:18.887
Oh, my God!

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.884
You have got to be
kidding me!

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.286
Merry Christmas, mother...

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.124
There he is!
Charge!

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.730
That's a good girl.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.680
Get off of me!

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.966
Stevie?

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.201
Stevie!

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:11.444
Hey! Give me back
my kids, you fudger!

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.439
Jordan!

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.046
Stevie. I'm coming, baby.

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:23.767
Stevie. Baby.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.841
It's okay.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.049
Mama's here. Mama's here.
There you go!

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.282
Mom, it got Jordan.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:32.562
It was gonna eat me next.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.201
Thanks, honey.

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:38.247
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.411
What?

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.204
Mom!

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.884
Max!

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.806
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby. It's okay.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.526
Max, are you okay?
Yeah.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.761
What happened up there?

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.968
They got Jordan.
Who?

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:15.886
Mom?

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.120
I think it's panicking,
trying to get outside.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.045
Well, we boarded
everything up.

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.441
Howard, that's Jordan.

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.567
We gotta get in there.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.926
We gotta get in
there and get her out.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.890
Linda, what are we dealing with?
What did you see up there?

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.724
You don't wanna know,
sweetheart.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.531
Honey, I just got
my ass kicked

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.965
by a bunch of
Christmas cookies,

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.486
so trust me when I say I can take it!

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:51.484
Max, what are you doing?

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.686
Go get them, girl.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.961
Get them, Rosie.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.170
Rosie?

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.769
For God's sake,
Howard, shoot it!

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.321
Dad!

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.685
Get it off me!

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.091
Dad!

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.080
You bitch!

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.604
Get it off me! God!

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.651
Dad!

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.131
Dad!

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.721
Omi!

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.963
Aunt Dorothy.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.280
Finish it.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.203
With pleasure.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.081
Oh, shit.

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.444
Max, be careful!

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.446
Mom!

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.291
Stay behind me!

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.249
Howard, where's Chrissy?
I don't know!

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.402
Where's the baby?

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.005
Honey, where's your sister?

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.081
No!

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.321
No, Linda! No!

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.481
Howard!

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.842
Howard, the baby!

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.004
I'll see you in hell.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:44.524
Twisted fairytale horseshit!

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.681
Howard, no!

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.170
Oh, great!

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.127
Are you okay?

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.731
Are you okay?

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.365
Max, get the ammo.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.201
Where did they go?

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.965
I'm more worried about
when they come back.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.405
We need to make
a break for it.

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:34.681
For what, Tom?

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.649
The snowplow.
It's our only shot.

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.291
And then we're
going after them.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.404
What is going on?

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.085
Sarah, what's going on?

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.731
Mom, come on,
we're leaving.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.686
You're gonna be okay.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:51.570
Mom! We have to go. Now!

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.401
It's him.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.726
Let's go.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.208
Max. Max.
Come, come, come.

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.680
- Hurry, hurry.
- Get your gloves on.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.165
Here, put your hood up.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.800
Okay, ready?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.161
Everybody...

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.445
Hold onto each other.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.725
Omi!

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.441
Be good.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:47.801
Omi!

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.331
Omi! Omi, no!

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.409
Omi!

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.005
Mom!

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.320
Mom, open the door!

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.721
Mom!

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.491
Mom, you open this door now!

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.967
The window.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.201
Dad!

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.282
She wants to face him.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:10.930
She's trying to help.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:16.841
Let's go.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.641
Let's go, let's go. Go!

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.924
Keep moving!

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.643
Go! Go, get
behind me. Go.

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.168
Go, go, go!
Keep moving.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.010
Come on, buddy.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.843
Come on.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.843
You have to go.
You have to go.

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.251
I need you to go!
No.

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.529
All of you, you have to go.
Do you understand?

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.365
Keep driving.
Do you understand?

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.851
I love you.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.530
I love you, buddy.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.202
Go! Now. Go!

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.441
Go!

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.561
Come on!

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:20.926
Come on.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:28.086
Keep going, keep going.
God, get in.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.366
I want you to
get up in here.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.800
And I don't want
you to move, okay?

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.285
You stay here,
you don't move.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.206
Okay?
You understand?

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.726
Mom! Mom, please!

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.326
Sarah!

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.926
Baby, go with
your Aunt Sarah.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.001
Sarah! Go! Go on!

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.410
Stevie, sweetheart, it's okay.
Mom!

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.323
It's okay. Come on.
No! Mom!

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:49.681
Sarah!

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.440
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:55.162
Sarah!

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.124
Mom! No!

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.044
I love you.
Mom! Mom!

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.966
Mom!

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.529
Max, we gotta go.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.046
Max, we gotta go. Max.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:14.927
Come on.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.086
Come on.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:19.769
It's not starting.
It's not starting.

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.325
Why isn't it starting?
Come on.

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.528
Come on! Come on, Max, please.
I'm trying.

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.409
I don't even know
how to drive a stick!

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.005
We have a hybrid!

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.520
Come on! Please!

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.486
Get off of me!

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:44.761
Stevie! Stevie!

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:46.367
Get off me!

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.531
I said get off!

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.527
Max!

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.924
Max! Max, no!

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.729
No! No! No!

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.567
Max!

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.165
Stevie!

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.167
<i>He left me as a reminder</i>

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:06.723
<i>of what happens
when hope is lost,</i>

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.811
<i>when belief is forgotten,</i>

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.686
<i>and the Christmas spirit dies.</i>

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.090
Help!

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:36.361
Help me!

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:42.761
Max!

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:55.601
Get off me!

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:02.810
Hey!

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.686
Asshole!

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.962
I take back my wish!

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.448
I take it all back!

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:28.809
Give me back my family!

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.007
Max!

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.849
Let her go!

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.644
Help me!

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.520
Please.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.328
I know you can fix this.

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.323
Give them back.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.925
Take me instead.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.124
No, what are you doing?
I said take me.

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:45.605
No, take me!

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.290
No, what are you doing?
Take me!

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.530
No!

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:50.926
Stevie!

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.644
Let me go!

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.689
No! No! Please!

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:11.801
I'm sorry.

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.811
I just wanted Christmas
to be like it used to be.

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.410
No!

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.164
Good throw, Sarah.

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.009
- You want down?
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.526
Doggie can't have cookie.
No, that's your cookie.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.045
This dog
didn't keep you guys up?

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.201
She likes to
bark at night.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.964
She sure does.

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:50.884
Thanks for making pancakes.
Those were really good.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:52.371
Good girl.

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.329
Morning.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.289
Flax smoothie
in the morning...

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:59.644
About time you got up.
We've been waiting forever.

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:01.529
Oh hey, there he is!
Hey, kiddo.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.680
We thought the sugarplum fairies
may have gotten you.

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.761
You're all alive.

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.241
Barely.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:11.650
I haven't felt this hungover
since the pope died.

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:13.000
What's up, buddy?
You okay?

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.126
Yeah, I just...

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.683
Just had a bad dream,
I guess.

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:21.881
Aw.

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.046
Enough with
the sappy crap.

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.531
Let's open up
the damn presents.

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:27.045
Okay. Okay, already.

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.122
Come on, Linda, let's do this.
You wanna help me?

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.081
Okay.

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.161
Okay.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.846
Merry Christmas, Max.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:36.920
Girls.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.724
I got two beverages.

01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:42.680
Stevie, sweetheart.

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.561
Thank you, Mom.

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.641
Are you excited?

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.802
Jordan.
Should be.

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.800
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:51.961
Isn't that fun?

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:54.842
Hey, Maxi-Pad.
Training batting gloves.

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.805
What could
that possibly be?

01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.646
Oh, my God!

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:01.610
"Oh, my God," is right.

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.120
That's from
me and the girls.

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:05.089
I had to reattach the foot.

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.322
Yeah,
if you look closely,

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:10.131
he did a really good
job of reattaching it.

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:12.880
The darn thing,
when we came up on it,

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.240
it was trying to chew
its own foot.

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.731
Oh, thank you.

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.569
This is great.

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:19.444
You're the best, Howard.
I want travel-size.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:21.563
Wow. What's
this all about?

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:24.522
It's nothing. Just...

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:26.685
Merry Christmas.

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:29.444
Merry Christmas
to you, too, Max.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.363
Merry Christmas, son.

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.121
Right?

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:41.565
I cannot believe it.

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:44.160
- This is the best.
- Oh, my God.

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:45.810
You're very welcome.

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.689
Oh, man.

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.571

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:33.364
<i>Not to give, but to take.</i>
