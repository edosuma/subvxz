00:03.604 --> 00:05.604
HETTY:
<i> Tell me, Arkady,</i>

00:05.606 --> 00:07.656
why do they want you dead?

00:07.657 --> 00:09.707
Because I would not give
them their ship back.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.376
What was on the boat?

00:11.378 --> 00:14.579
The only true currency accepted
everywhere in the world.

00:14.581 --> 00:15.580
Oil.

00:15.582 --> 00:18.082
More than $100 million.

00:18.084 --> 00:20.050
That's enough to finance a war.

00:20.052 --> 00:21.551
CALLEN:
One more question.

00:21.553 --> 00:23.119
Who's Anna?

00:23.121 --> 00:24.604
Nice Russian girl.

00:24.605 --> 00:26.088
Any update on
the oil tanker?

00:26.090 --> 00:27.589
Yeah, it's not there.

00:27.591 --> 00:29.557
Weather satellite
couldn't find it.

00:29.559 --> 00:31.125
And the ship's transponder's
been turned off.

00:31.127 --> 00:34.761
I have a hunch this one
isn't quite over with.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.366
(laughter,
dance music pulsating)

00:40.368 --> 00:42.368
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Love it, ladies, love it!

00:42.370 --> 00:44.103
(whoops)
Oh, beautiful.

00:44.105 --> 00:45.104
Work for it.

00:45.106 --> 00:47.072
Show me you
want it, baby.

00:47.074 --> 00:48.740
Show me
you want it-- yes!

00:48.742 --> 00:50.074
Love it, love it.

00:50.076 --> 00:51.475
Yes.

00:51.477 --> 00:52.809
Love it! Beautiful!

00:52.811 --> 00:54.143
Love it.

00:54.145 --> 00:55.310
Wonderful, ladies.

00:55.312 --> 00:56.444
Wonderful!

00:56.446 --> 00:58.512
Now...
into the surf, ladies.

00:58.514 --> 01:00.113
Love it!
Get in the water!

01:00.115 --> 01:02.548
Let's party!
Oh, I love you!

01:03.651 --> 01:05.317
Ay, yi, yi!

01:05.319 --> 01:07.285
What's the problem
now, Lexi?

01:07.287 --> 01:09.387
I-I can't, Sebastian.

01:11.290 --> 01:12.622
Turn the music off!

01:12.624 --> 01:15.124
Come on, Lexi,
get into the water.
You're blowing it.

01:15.126 --> 01:16.458
I almost drowned as a kid.

01:16.460 --> 01:18.193
I got a thing about the ocean.

01:18.195 --> 01:20.195
That doesn't even make sense.

01:20.197 --> 01:22.530
You are a<i> swimsuit</i> model.

01:22.532 --> 01:24.131
Or at least you were.

01:24.133 --> 01:25.532
Lexi...

01:25.534 --> 01:27.467
you are not special,

01:27.469 --> 01:29.168
but you are
wasting my time.

01:29.170 --> 01:32.671
Now get your ass into
this water, or get off my set!

01:33.840 --> 01:35.139
There is nothing
in this water that could...

01:35.141 --> 01:37.174
Aah! Aah! Oh!

01:38.577 --> 01:39.642
(yells)

01:39.644 --> 01:40.709
(screams)

01:40.711 --> 01:42.410
(screaming)

01:42.412 --> 01:43.778
(all screaming, shrieking)

02:09.672 --> 02:11.672
I just don't get it.

02:11.674 --> 02:15.776
Clearly, you don't understand
the concept of friendship.

02:15.778 --> 02:17.277
I'm the friend
telling you

02:17.279 --> 02:18.778
you're being used
as an ATM machine.

02:18.780 --> 02:20.246
I mean, what is
it for this time?

02:20.248 --> 02:22.114
Real estate? An invention?

02:22.116 --> 02:23.248
A Ponzi scheme?

02:23.250 --> 02:25.149
(Kensi chuckles)

02:25.151 --> 02:26.617
You don't know, do you?

02:26.619 --> 02:28.485
Gentlemen, help me out--
if you have a good friend

02:28.487 --> 02:30.753
that's in a jam and needs
a loan, what do you do?

02:30.755 --> 02:32.321
KENSI: No, no, no, don't
withhold information.

02:32.323 --> 02:33.655
This friend has had
several loans

02:33.657 --> 02:35.189
which he has not
paid back.

02:35.191 --> 02:36.323
How many is "several"?

02:36.325 --> 02:38.158
Three.
How many?

02:38.160 --> 02:39.359
Five.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.160
What was that?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.428
Seven.
Aha, there it is.

02:44.430 --> 02:48.432
If it were me, I'd tell him
the bank is closed.

02:48.434 --> 02:50.367
It depends
what it's for.

02:50.369 --> 02:51.868
But I would establish terms
up front

02:51.870 --> 02:53.803
so there's no pressure
on either of us.

02:53.805 --> 02:55.871
But you should never
lend anything

02:55.873 --> 02:58.573
that you actually expect
to get back.

02:59.609 --> 03:00.874
What was that?

03:00.876 --> 03:02.141
Yeah, what was that?

03:02.143 --> 03:03.909
What was what?
CALLEN: That look.

03:03.911 --> 03:05.510
Was that directed at me?

03:05.512 --> 03:07.678
Well, since you
brought it up.

03:07.680 --> 03:11.415
My night vision goggles,
my stun baton,

03:11.417 --> 03:13.183
my new headphones...

03:13.185 --> 03:15.251
You know those got blown up
in Mexico.

03:15.253 --> 03:17.419
You borrowed them.
They're your responsibility...

03:17.421 --> 03:18.887
You see what
I'm saying.
Very difficult.

03:18.889 --> 03:21.189
SAM: That's why it's called
"borrowing" and not a gift.

03:21.191 --> 03:24.192
(whistles)
We got a case, boys.

03:24.194 --> 03:24.926
And girl.

03:24.928 --> 03:27.260
Thank you.

03:29.564 --> 03:31.564
My vintage Rolex.

03:31.566 --> 03:32.898
You wanted that back?

03:32.900 --> 03:34.799
Why wouldn't I
want it back?

03:34.801 --> 03:35.933
It's old.

03:35.935 --> 03:37.868
It's vintage.

03:37.870 --> 03:39.202
Deeks, Deeks.
DEEKS: Yeah.

03:39.204 --> 03:40.870
Uh, d-did you, uh...

03:40.871 --> 03:42.537
did you check out the
business plan for my new app?

03:42.540 --> 03:44.439
I mean, come on,
it's gonna be huge.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.774
Yeah, no, about that,
I-I can't do it, buddy.

03:46.776 --> 03:50.744
You haven't paid back the last
eight outstanding loans.

03:50.746 --> 03:52.812
Loans?
Loans.

03:52.814 --> 03:54.413
Those were equity
investments.

03:54.415 --> 03:55.881
Right, partner?

03:55.883 --> 03:57.549
Come on,
whatever happened

03:57.551 --> 03:59.417
to "if we're not failing,
we're not trying," huh?

03:59.419 --> 04:01.485
Yeah, I know,
that sounds fantastic.

04:01.487 --> 04:02.953
I just, I can't...
I can't do it.

04:02.955 --> 04:04.821
Sorry.

04:04.823 --> 04:06.823
Equity's only gonna
get more expensive.

04:06.825 --> 04:08.491
You're gonna regret this.

04:08.493 --> 04:09.558
I already do.

04:11.295 --> 04:12.661
What?

04:18.200 --> 04:20.466
This body washed up
in Long Beach this morning.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.801
Hands bound,
two gunshots to the chest.

04:22.803 --> 04:24.702
Coast Guard found three more
bodies just like this

04:24.704 --> 04:27.204
two miles off the coast,
same scenario.

04:27.206 --> 04:28.471
They were executed.

04:28.473 --> 04:29.805
Any idea who they are?

04:29.807 --> 04:31.807
Remember Arkady's
missing oil tanker?

04:31.809 --> 04:33.275
This is the crew.

04:33.277 --> 04:35.310
Well, part of it.

04:35.312 --> 04:36.544
So the tanker's been recovered.

04:36.546 --> 04:38.812
No, just the bodies.

04:38.814 --> 04:40.480
So there was either
a mutiny on board,

04:40.482 --> 04:42.882
or someone outside took control
of the ship.

04:42.884 --> 04:44.917
That tanker's carrying
over $100 million in oil.

04:44.919 --> 04:46.985
Whoever stole it wants
to convert it into cash.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.519
Or sail it into the harbor...

04:48.521 --> 04:49.987
and boom.

04:49.989 --> 04:52.889
Brother and sister that
brokered the deal with Arkady?

04:52.891 --> 04:54.357
Yeah, Patrick and Elia Berkeley?

04:54.359 --> 04:56.225
Patrick is being held

04:56.227 --> 04:57.993
until sentencing at
Victorville Penitentiary.

04:57.995 --> 04:59.661
He's charged with
circumventing

04:59.663 --> 05:02.330
U.S. economic sanctions
against Russia.

05:02.332 --> 05:03.964
Okay, what about the sister?
Metro?

05:03.966 --> 05:04.965
Redondo.

05:04.967 --> 05:06.967
Comfort of
her own home.

05:06.969 --> 05:08.619
She did a deal.

05:08.620 --> 05:10.270
Pinned the entire operation
on her brother.

05:10.272 --> 05:11.337
Wow.

05:11.339 --> 05:13.639
Turns out oil's thicker
than blood.

05:13.641 --> 05:14.673
What about Arkady?

05:14.675 --> 05:16.208
We got a bead on him?

05:16.209 --> 05:17.742
Uh, well, the trackers
that Hetty had installed

05:17.744 --> 05:19.643
on his cars indicate
that he's at home.

05:19.645 --> 05:20.977
Well, the bodies aren't
decomposed, yet,

05:20.979 --> 05:22.912
so the ship could still be
in the area.

05:22.914 --> 05:24.280
We've looked
everywhere.

05:24.281 --> 05:25.647
It's like trying to find
a needle in a haystack.

05:25.650 --> 05:27.349
You guys handle
the Berkeleys.

05:27.351 --> 05:29.317
Start with Patrick,
his sister double-crossed him--

05:29.319 --> 05:31.018
he's got nothing to
lose by speaking.

05:31.020 --> 05:32.919
All right.

05:32.921 --> 05:34.787
Might be difficult.

05:36.290 --> 05:38.456
Patrick Berkeley was murdered
this morning.

05:38.458 --> 05:40.624
You're gonna have
to start with Elia.

05:40.626 --> 05:43.259
Better go deliver the bad news.

05:45.296 --> 05:46.828
Think it's related?

05:46.830 --> 05:48.830
Well, it could be just
a prison incident,

05:48.832 --> 05:49.997
or it could be more.

05:49.999 --> 05:51.665
What I do know is

05:51.667 --> 05:54.000
we got a second shot
at finding that oil tanker.

05:54.002 --> 05:56.268
Don't waste it.

05:58.939 --> 06:03.007
You know, that leaves you, me
and your favorite Russian.

06:03.009 --> 06:04.508
Come on, you like him.

06:05.644 --> 06:06.943
A little.

06:08.746 --> 06:10.312
SAM:
Yeah, keep it up.

06:10.314 --> 06:12.347
Little bit?

06:22.826 --> 06:24.559
Awfully quiet.

06:24.561 --> 06:25.560
Where are the guards?

06:25.562 --> 06:26.794
Cars are here.

06:26.796 --> 06:29.329
Still doesn't feel right.

06:36.437 --> 06:38.003
What are you doing?

06:38.005 --> 06:39.404
He rigged his car to explode.

06:39.406 --> 06:41.372
What do you think
he'll do to his house?

06:41.374 --> 06:42.840
If I die because of
Arkady's paranoia,

06:42.842 --> 06:44.308
I deserve it.

06:45.311 --> 06:46.810
(chuckles)

06:46.812 --> 06:48.478
We got to get
in there.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.013
Could be bleeding out
on the kitchen floor.

06:52.483 --> 06:53.648
You don't want me
to check it?

06:53.650 --> 06:55.583
Where's your sense
of adventure?

06:55.585 --> 06:57.251
It's in here.

06:57.252 --> 06:58.918
I just don't want it to splatter
all over the driveway.

06:58.921 --> 07:00.954
Uh-huh.

07:01.923 --> 07:02.855
Good?

07:14.734 --> 07:16.034
Clear.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.769
It's all clear.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.771
If Arkady brokered
the deal for the oil,

07:20.773 --> 07:22.839
there's got to be something
here to lead us to it.

07:31.482 --> 07:33.048
(chuckles)

07:37.854 --> 07:40.120
Impressive.

07:40.122 --> 07:42.122
You got something?

07:42.124 --> 07:44.057
Smile for the camera.

08:05.479 --> 08:07.078
It's a good thing he's paranoid.

08:10.116 --> 08:11.782
SAM: The hell has
he got in there,

08:11.784 --> 08:13.617
blueprints to
the Kremlin?

08:13.619 --> 08:15.085
1-1-3-1.

08:18.990 --> 08:20.856
CALLEN:
He took his passport.

08:20.858 --> 08:22.523
He's skipping town.

08:25.261 --> 08:26.960
SAM:
Why take a taxi?

08:26.962 --> 08:28.795
Think he knows
Hetty's tracking him?

08:28.797 --> 08:29.796
(phone line ringing)

08:29.798 --> 08:30.830
Hey, Callan.
Eric.

08:30.832 --> 08:32.031
Hey, what's up?
What do you got?

08:32.033 --> 08:34.166
Arkady got a taxi
about two hours ago.

08:34.168 --> 08:35.600
See if you can find out where
they dropped him off.

08:35.602 --> 08:36.968
On it.
Yeah.

08:36.970 --> 08:39.103
Well, something definitely
has him freaked out.

08:39.105 --> 08:41.038
He didn't wipe the hard drive
on his security camera here.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.105
SAM:
Gotcha.

08:45.176 --> 08:46.241
SAM: This guy.

08:46.243 --> 08:48.576
(keypad beeping)

08:50.246 --> 08:51.979
Documents, passports...

08:51.981 --> 08:54.081
This could be anything.

09:02.957 --> 09:05.257
SAM:
Is that Resnikov?

09:06.760 --> 09:08.025
His real name is
Hans Schrieber.

09:08.027 --> 09:09.893
Huh.
Like I told you.

09:09.895 --> 09:12.061
It's complicated.

09:12.063 --> 09:15.030
So your old man helped people
escape from Russia.

09:15.032 --> 09:17.032
Yeah.

09:17.034 --> 09:19.067
They sent him
to the Gulag for that.

09:19.069 --> 09:21.803
Guess I'm not the only one
looking for answers.

09:23.072 --> 09:24.838
It's pretty cool,
your dad being a hero.

09:26.741 --> 09:27.840
You got it honest.

09:43.323 --> 09:45.089
What you got?

09:45.091 --> 09:47.324
I'm not sure.

09:51.630 --> 09:54.197
There's nothing in here
to lead us to the oil.

09:54.199 --> 09:56.265
Let's get out of here.

09:59.003 --> 10:01.602
Arkady could be laughing
at us right now.

10:04.974 --> 10:06.707
DEEKS: Elia's still not
picking up her phone.

10:10.979 --> 10:13.212
So the Berkeleys inherit
the family business,

10:13.214 --> 10:17.916
they run it into the ground
and end up economic sanctions.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.918
Slippery slope.
Yeah.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.120
Question is-- why would Elia
testify against her own brother?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.655
Well, you're assuming
they liked each other.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.189
(knocks on door)
Well, enough to go
into business together.

10:27.659 --> 10:30.660
Or maybe he told her
to testify against him

10:30.662 --> 10:32.128
to save her,
you know what I mean?

10:32.130 --> 10:35.131
Like a, like a personal
sacrifice; an act of love.

10:35.133 --> 10:36.332
Yeah, I would get that
between a husband and a wife,

10:36.334 --> 10:37.366
but a brother and sister?

10:37.368 --> 10:39.034
(knocking)

10:39.036 --> 10:40.035
Maybe they're both.

10:40.037 --> 10:41.703
Ew!
What?

10:41.705 --> 10:43.771
It makes sense.
Nothing you say makes sense.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.289
Think about this.

10:45.290 --> 10:46.806
This whole criminal empire
is spawned

10:46.809 --> 10:48.775
from the twisted frustration
of forbidden lust.

10:48.777 --> 10:49.776
Wow.

10:49.778 --> 10:51.210
Thank you for that, Mr. Creepy.

10:51.212 --> 10:52.978
That makes sense!

10:52.979 --> 10:54.745
You know what I mean?
She testified.

10:54.748 --> 10:56.881
Okay, I'll give you they don't
both have to go to prison.

10:56.883 --> 10:59.783
Especially if they have business
on the outside.
Right.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.785
Like a hundred-million-dollar
oil tanker.

11:01.787 --> 11:04.187
This is the power
of forbidden lust.

11:05.256 --> 11:06.321
Deeks...

11:16.132 --> 11:17.263
Three, two, one...

11:20.901 --> 11:22.133
(Deeks exhales)

11:24.737 --> 11:26.169
Kens?

11:26.171 --> 11:27.904
(sighs)

11:27.906 --> 11:29.656
We're too late.

11:29.657 --> 11:31.407
So somebody wanted Elia and
her brother out of the way.

11:31.409 --> 11:33.675
The question is, whom?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.219
DEEKS:
Thank you, Steve. Appreciate it.

11:45.221 --> 11:46.653
STEVE:
You got it.

11:46.655 --> 11:48.087
DEEKS:
Well, the method is consistent

11:48.089 --> 11:49.788
with the way
the oil tanker crew was killed.

11:49.790 --> 11:53.224
This is the second time
somebody's tried to kill her.

11:53.226 --> 11:56.093
This time?
Not so lucky.

11:56.095 --> 11:57.861
What about the hit man

11:57.863 --> 11:59.428
from the Arkady sting
a few weeks ago?

12:02.433 --> 12:04.433
DEEKS:
Nicolai Brantov.

12:04.435 --> 12:05.867
Yeah, Callen thought he was
working for the Russians.

12:05.869 --> 12:07.268
Well, whoever
he was working for,

12:07.270 --> 12:08.736
they obviously haven't
packed up and gone home.

12:08.738 --> 12:10.270
(phone line ringing)

12:10.272 --> 12:11.404
NELL: Kensi, what's
happening with you guys?

12:11.406 --> 12:13.339
Hey, Nell.
Can you find out

12:13.340 --> 12:15.273
exactly who Nikolai Brantov
was working for?

12:15.276 --> 12:16.842
Yeah, no problem.
Great, thank you.

12:16.844 --> 12:19.311
Yeah, I bet money
whoever that is...

12:19.313 --> 12:21.379
has the oil tanker.

12:21.381 --> 12:22.713
Shotgun!

12:27.219 --> 12:28.318
Gotcha.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.752
Did you find the tanker?

12:29.754 --> 12:30.753
Not yet.

12:30.755 --> 12:32.121
If it's been unflagged,

12:32.123 --> 12:33.689
it might be possible, but...

12:33.691 --> 12:35.691
Kaleidoscope
found Arkady's taxi.

12:35.693 --> 12:36.992
GRANGER:
Where?

12:36.994 --> 12:39.461
ERIC: Dropped him off
at a garage in Studio City.

12:39.463 --> 12:41.329
Arkady enters...

12:41.331 --> 12:43.464
And then,
four minutes later...

12:45.468 --> 12:47.835
<i>Dasvidaniya,</i> baby.

12:47.837 --> 12:49.736
Some guys stash burn phones,

12:49.738 --> 12:51.471
Arkady stashes burn vehicles.

12:51.473 --> 12:53.339
Yeah. Insurance on
all those extra cars

12:53.341 --> 12:55.106
must be a nightmare.
(chuckles)

12:58.711 --> 13:00.777
Where is he now?
Uh...

13:00.779 --> 13:03.012
headed west
on Ventura Boulevard.

13:03.014 --> 13:04.346
GRANGER:
All right, get that intel
to Callen and Sam.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.448
Copy that.
And find that tanker

13:06.450 --> 13:09.417
before it shows up 50 yards
off the Santa Monica pier.

13:09.419 --> 13:11.285
(clicks tongue)

13:20.962 --> 13:22.194
Ah, screw it.

13:23.897 --> 13:25.363
(tires screeching)

13:25.365 --> 13:26.931
You idiot!

13:29.101 --> 13:30.400
Classic road rage.

13:30.402 --> 13:32.101
(sighs)
CALLEN:
You see that, Sam?

13:32.103 --> 13:33.202
SAM:
Ah...

13:33.204 --> 13:35.871
You know, if I didn't
know any better,

13:35.873 --> 13:37.739
I would think
he wasn't happy to see us.

13:37.741 --> 13:39.373
Always happy to see my guys,

13:39.375 --> 13:40.741
but something tells me

13:40.743 --> 13:43.143
this meeting is
not by chance.

13:43.145 --> 13:46.246
And by "something," I mean
my home surveillance system.

13:46.248 --> 13:47.413
SAM:
Nice truck.

13:47.415 --> 13:49.081
Is it new?

13:49.082 --> 13:50.748
Since I last saw you and
your boss, I seem to have

13:50.751 --> 13:53.084
"bug" infestation.

13:53.086 --> 13:55.986
They're in my cars,
they're in my clothes...

13:55.988 --> 13:58.288
I had to buy a new wardrobe.

14:00.325 --> 14:02.158
New wardrobe.
What is this, polyester?

14:02.160 --> 14:03.526
Egyptian silk.

14:03.528 --> 14:04.527
You like?

14:04.529 --> 14:05.528
Not really.

14:05.530 --> 14:07.463
Of course not.

14:07.465 --> 14:09.431
European cut.

14:14.303 --> 14:15.902
Going to war, Arkady?

14:15.904 --> 14:19.505
Did I not teach you anything
about being prepared?

14:19.507 --> 14:20.772
Mm-hmm.
'Cause you never know

14:20.774 --> 14:22.306
when a bazooka's
gonna come in handy.

14:27.012 --> 14:28.811
What is this?

14:33.217 --> 14:35.250
Looks like worthless old coin.

14:35.252 --> 14:36.784
SAM:
What do you know

14:36.786 --> 14:38.152
about Elia Berkeley's murder?

14:38.154 --> 14:41.021
News to me. Uh...

14:41.023 --> 14:43.456
Sounds like
she's having bad month.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.191
Oh, and her brother Patrick
was murdered in prison

14:45.193 --> 14:47.059
shortly after the crew
from that oil tanker

14:47.061 --> 14:48.560
washed up dead on the beach.

14:48.562 --> 14:50.528
It's been a busy morning.

14:50.530 --> 14:53.430
Somebody is sending message.
Mm-hmm.

14:53.432 --> 14:55.165
Well, maybe you better
come with us.

14:55.167 --> 14:56.499
If this is some kind of pushback

14:56.501 --> 14:58.167
from that oil deal,
you could be next.

14:58.169 --> 15:00.002
Sweet of you to worry,

15:00.004 --> 15:01.803
but if someone
is not trying to kill me,

15:01.805 --> 15:02.970
I'm not doing my job.

15:02.972 --> 15:04.438
You don't have a job.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.807
Your words sting,

15:06.809 --> 15:07.941
but I know

15:07.943 --> 15:09.509
it's because you care.

15:09.511 --> 15:11.344
Now, if you'll excuse me...
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

15:11.346 --> 15:13.245
Come on.
What's your hurry?

15:13.247 --> 15:14.846
Last time we saw you,

15:14.848 --> 15:16.113
you were begging
for our protection.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.015
And now you want
nothing to do with us.

15:18.017 --> 15:20.150
Don't take it personally.

15:20.152 --> 15:22.585
Or do.

15:22.587 --> 15:25.988
Either way,
I have business to attend to.

15:27.224 --> 15:28.590
Well, the weapons alone
in this truck

15:28.592 --> 15:29.591
are enough to bring him in, Sam.

15:29.593 --> 15:30.592
SAM:
Even worse,

15:30.594 --> 15:32.427
he ran a red light.

15:32.429 --> 15:34.495
Mm-hmm.

15:34.497 --> 15:36.530
Your move, Big Man.

15:36.532 --> 15:39.466
(chuckles)

15:39.468 --> 15:43.068
Always nice to spend time
with comrades.

15:45.505 --> 15:47.571
Lead the way.

15:48.707 --> 15:49.972
Eric, what do you got?

15:49.974 --> 15:52.975
Take a look at this.

15:52.977 --> 15:54.643
(sighs)
I initiated a search

15:54.645 --> 15:56.077
in the visitation system
at Victorville Prison,

15:56.079 --> 15:58.379
see if we could catch a break.

15:58.381 --> 16:00.214
You know, maybe Patrick Berkeley
had a visitor,

16:00.216 --> 16:01.215
or a phone call.

16:01.217 --> 16:02.516
Shot in the dark.

16:02.518 --> 16:03.650
Did you get any hits?

16:03.652 --> 16:04.651
No, we did not.

16:04.653 --> 16:06.686
But I did find something odd.

16:06.688 --> 16:08.721
Three phone calls went out
from a land line

16:08.723 --> 16:11.523
between 3:12 a.m. and 3:42 a.m.

16:11.525 --> 16:13.191
From where, exactly,
inside the prison?

16:13.193 --> 16:14.458
Third floor, "D" block.

16:14.460 --> 16:16.010
Now, there's not a lot

16:16.011 --> 16:17.561
of normal phone
traffic around that time.

16:17.563 --> 16:18.628
You know, a couple...
(clicks tongue)

16:18.630 --> 16:19.595
...booty calls and what not.

16:19.597 --> 16:21.964
But who's making calls

16:21.966 --> 16:23.098
that early in the morning,

16:23.100 --> 16:25.366
from a land line, in prison?

16:25.368 --> 16:27.134
Mr. Marty Deeks?

16:27.136 --> 16:28.201
Uh, prison personnel?

16:28.203 --> 16:29.635
Well, that's not that odd.

16:29.637 --> 16:31.670
Guards working third shifts
keep weird hours. So what?

16:31.672 --> 16:34.139
All right, but add it to the
fact that the call was placed

16:34.141 --> 16:36.374
to a cell phone
at this location.

16:38.311 --> 16:39.543
KENSI:
That's Arkady's address.

16:39.545 --> 16:41.061
It is indeed.

16:41.062 --> 16:42.578
I did a search for
everyone with access to

16:42.581 --> 16:44.147
that land line in "D" Block

16:44.149 --> 16:45.648
and I came up with this guy.

16:48.185 --> 16:49.751
Meet Sergeant
Charles Turner.

16:49.753 --> 16:51.086
Currently a guard

16:51.087 --> 16:52.420
at Victorville
Penitentiary.

16:52.422 --> 16:53.988
But back in '08,

16:53.990 --> 16:57.191
worked security for
one Mr. Arkady Kolcheck.

16:57.193 --> 16:58.358
This could mean Arkady's the one

16:58.360 --> 16:59.726
that put the hit out
on Patrick Berkeley.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.327
We have an address for Turner?

17:01.329 --> 17:02.695
Already in your phones.

17:02.697 --> 17:04.263
Good job. Keep Callen
and Sam in the loop.

17:04.265 --> 17:05.330
Yep.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.567
NELL:
Hey, guys.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.535
You asked if we could find
out anything on the hit man

17:11.537 --> 17:13.003
that tried to take
the Berkeleys out.

17:13.005 --> 17:14.004
Nikolai Brantov?

17:14.006 --> 17:15.772
Unfortunately,
we did.

17:15.774 --> 17:18.775
He was working as a gun
for hire, specializing in

17:18.777 --> 17:20.743
"send a message"-type contracts.

17:20.745 --> 17:23.045
He was busted a year ago
on gun charges.

17:23.047 --> 17:25.079
And guess who bailed him out?

17:27.583 --> 17:29.282
Ivan Karposev?

17:29.284 --> 17:30.716
Yep.
KENSI:
This man's a butcher.

17:30.718 --> 17:32.651
Talk about a bad day
getting worse.

17:32.653 --> 17:34.119
Do we even know if
Karposev's in the country?

17:34.121 --> 17:35.620
NELL:
We haven't clocked him yet,

17:35.622 --> 17:37.355
but given
the excessive violence,

17:37.357 --> 17:38.723
it's definitely his style.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.691
Any chance Arkady hired Brantov
away from Karposev?

17:40.693 --> 17:44.361
Very doubtful, Mr. Deeks.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.296
HETTY:
Ivan Karposev

17:46.298 --> 17:47.797
is the kind of man
you don't double-cross

17:47.799 --> 17:49.698
and live to tell the tale.

17:49.700 --> 17:53.034
Karposev tortured and murdered
four federal agents

17:53.036 --> 17:55.136
in a weapons trafficking
sting last year.

17:55.138 --> 17:57.505
He even went so far
as to force an agent

17:57.507 --> 17:59.173
to kill his own men
by lowering them

17:59.175 --> 18:01.241
into a vat of hydrochloric acid.

18:01.243 --> 18:02.775
HETTY:
The man has

18:02.777 --> 18:05.544
no regard for life.

18:05.546 --> 18:07.646
That's why
you'll always be

18:07.648 --> 18:09.748
at a disadvantage with him.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.417
Karposev's after
the oil tanker.

18:12.419 --> 18:15.052
I think the question is...

18:15.054 --> 18:16.586
does he already have it?

18:23.461 --> 18:26.395
Two people associated
with the ship are dead

18:26.397 --> 18:28.430
and Arkady is connected with
at least one of their murders.

18:28.432 --> 18:29.764
Yeah, but we don't know

18:29.766 --> 18:32.066
if Arkady or Karposev
killed Elia Berkeley.

18:32.068 --> 18:34.068
We don't even know
if Karposev is in the mix.

18:34.070 --> 18:35.202
Yeah, but what if he is?

18:35.204 --> 18:37.070
And he has the tanker?

18:37.072 --> 18:40.206
Then a dangerous threat
just got more powerful.

18:40.208 --> 18:42.841
Let's let him sweat.

18:42.843 --> 18:44.475
If Eric and Nell come up
with a concrete link

18:44.477 --> 18:45.476
between Arkady
and Elia Berkeley,

18:45.478 --> 18:48.345
we'll bring the house
down on him.

18:51.717 --> 18:54.250
You see the way he reacted
when I showed him this coin?

18:54.252 --> 18:55.618
Oh, yeah.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.820
I'm going to try
and run it down.

18:57.822 --> 19:01.089
I'm good.

19:01.091 --> 19:03.524
I got this.

19:09.631 --> 19:11.731
Wow.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.332
Pretty nice for a prison guard.

19:13.334 --> 19:14.583
You could afford it

19:14.584 --> 19:15.833
if you weren't being
such a sugar daddy.

19:15.836 --> 19:16.835
What are you talking about?

19:16.837 --> 19:18.236
I gotta keep
my ladybird happy.

19:18.237 --> 19:19.636
Oh, I'm not talking
about myself.

19:19.639 --> 19:21.639
I am referring to the
mooch you call a friend.

19:21.641 --> 19:23.574
Wow. Kind of walked
into that one.

19:23.576 --> 19:24.808
Yes, you did.
See that?

19:24.810 --> 19:27.177
KENSI:
Uh-huh.

19:31.416 --> 19:33.549
KENSI:
Hey. See what I see?

19:33.551 --> 19:35.384
Oh, yeah.

19:35.386 --> 19:37.119
That is the definition
of probable cause.

19:37.121 --> 19:38.153
Mm-hmm.

19:38.155 --> 19:39.154
On three.

19:39.156 --> 19:40.722
One, two, three.

19:49.365 --> 19:50.597
DEEKS:
Clear!

19:50.599 --> 19:51.731
Clear.

19:54.135 --> 19:55.134
Wow.

19:55.136 --> 19:57.169
Turner's got boxes
full of cash

19:57.171 --> 19:59.905
back here, which means he either
likes to make it rain,

19:59.907 --> 20:02.407
or he's hustling on the side.

20:05.378 --> 20:06.744
Deeks?

20:06.746 --> 20:08.212
DEEKS:
Yeah.

20:08.213 --> 20:09.679
(whistles)
Looks like Turner's
making a killing

20:09.682 --> 20:10.814
selling contraband
to the inmates.

20:10.816 --> 20:11.815
Captive buyers.

20:11.817 --> 20:12.916
Supply and demand.

20:12.918 --> 20:13.917
TURNER:
Listen up!

20:13.919 --> 20:15.518
I'm a cop and I'm armed!

20:17.822 --> 20:18.821
We're federal agents!

20:18.823 --> 20:20.355
We just want to talk, Turner.

20:20.357 --> 20:21.856
(door opens, rapid footsteps)

20:21.858 --> 20:22.923
He's running.

20:27.862 --> 20:29.761
DEEKS: Split up!
Yep!

20:39.705 --> 20:41.438
(grunting)

20:42.741 --> 20:43.873
Ow!

20:43.875 --> 20:45.241
Deeks, you okay?

20:45.243 --> 20:46.642
Yeah.

20:46.644 --> 20:49.211
Ah... no, I'm fantastic.

20:49.213 --> 20:50.912
(Deeks whoops)
KENSI:
All right.

20:50.914 --> 20:53.447
What, are you living out your
pro wrestling fantasy? Huh?

20:53.449 --> 20:54.815
You know,
I'd be lying

20:54.817 --> 20:56.883
if I said that
didn't feel awesome.

21:11.199 --> 21:13.265
¶ ¶

21:29.650 --> 21:32.217
(sighs)

21:55.775 --> 21:58.842
¶ ¶

22:26.003 --> 22:29.637
You have a tracking device
on me, too, Hetty?

22:29.639 --> 22:32.673
I was just wondering

22:32.675 --> 22:35.742
why my employee wasn't

22:35.744 --> 22:38.044
on the job.

22:38.046 --> 22:41.414
Law requires that I take
a one-hour lunch

22:41.416 --> 22:43.482
plus two 15 minute
breaks every day.

22:43.484 --> 22:45.684
Well, I'll let it slide,

22:45.686 --> 22:48.653
if we consider
this a working lunch.

22:48.655 --> 22:51.555
That is what I'm trying
to figure out.

22:55.661 --> 22:59.362
Ooh! Vladimir Lenin.

22:59.364 --> 23:01.530
Special edition.
Very rare.

23:01.532 --> 23:04.833
This was minted,
but never circulated.

23:07.604 --> 23:10.938
You know it was rumored
that Lenin was

23:10.940 --> 23:14.674
critical of Russia
in his private life.

23:16.577 --> 23:19.010
Meaning?

23:20.380 --> 23:23.381
Your guess is as good as mine.

23:23.383 --> 23:25.082
Obviously, it meant

23:25.084 --> 23:27.918
something to these people.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.586
And possibly your father.

23:33.524 --> 23:35.056
This whole thing with Arkady

23:35.058 --> 23:37.658
and Hans Schrieber
and my father, I...

23:40.562 --> 23:43.862
Arkady knows more
than he's telling me.

23:46.032 --> 23:48.899
Was I meant to find this?

23:50.535 --> 23:53.502
Anything's possible
with that man.

23:55.038 --> 23:59.640
Don't let the personal get in
the way of the professional,

23:59.642 --> 24:01.842
Mr. Callen.

24:01.844 --> 24:04.945
And if they're
all wrapped up together?

24:04.947 --> 24:08.515
Pray they're not.

24:18.526 --> 24:20.592
What's up?

24:21.695 --> 24:23.361
Thanks.
No problem.

24:23.363 --> 24:25.363
Wow, he's still
out cold, huh?

24:25.365 --> 24:27.431
(laughs):
Are you gloating?

24:34.673 --> 24:37.141
Listen, why don't
you go, uh, distract

24:37.143 --> 24:38.742
the guard with your cleavage?

24:38.744 --> 24:40.143
(quietly):
Really?

24:40.144 --> 24:41.543
I'm gonna use the
defibrillator

24:41.546 --> 24:42.811
to wake him up.

24:42.813 --> 24:44.879
What if
it doesn't work?

24:44.881 --> 24:46.814
What are you talking about?
Your cleavage always works.

24:46.816 --> 24:48.148
(chuckles)

24:48.150 --> 24:49.749
I was talking
about the defibrillator.

24:49.751 --> 24:50.950
Well, then he dies.

24:50.952 --> 24:52.651
And we harvest his organs,
make a killing,

24:52.653 --> 24:53.685
move to Mexico. Ready?

24:53.687 --> 24:54.686
(defibrillator machine whirring)

24:54.688 --> 24:55.687
All right. Clear!

24:55.689 --> 24:57.588
Wait! Don't.

24:57.590 --> 24:59.590
Oh, look at that--
and the Oscar goes to Turner.

24:59.592 --> 25:01.625
How do you know Arkady Kolcheck?

25:01.627 --> 25:02.692
Who?

25:02.694 --> 25:04.060
Used to work security for him.

25:04.062 --> 25:06.262
I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:06.264 --> 25:07.930
All right, clear!
Wait!

25:07.932 --> 25:09.731
KENSI: You better start
knowing, otherwise

25:09.733 --> 25:11.632
we're gonna jump-start
your memory for you.

25:16.138 --> 25:19.706
Arkady paid me to get some
information from an inmate.

25:19.708 --> 25:21.808
Patrick Berkeley.
Why did you kill him?

25:21.810 --> 25:23.042
I didn't.

25:23.044 --> 25:24.977
I just let some
other inmates in

25:24.979 --> 25:28.747
to press him and...
it went south.

25:28.749 --> 25:29.647
So you did kill him.

25:30.249 --> 25:31.915
What was Arkady looking for?

25:31.917 --> 25:34.284
Listen, Turner,

25:34.286 --> 25:37.687
we know that Berkeley told you
something and you called Arkady.

25:39.657 --> 25:41.556
Hmm.
Wow.

25:41.558 --> 25:43.724
Which gang is more prominent
at Victorville?

25:43.726 --> 25:45.125
Is it the Latin Kings?

25:45.127 --> 25:46.660
Yeah, I think
it's the Latin Kings.

25:46.661 --> 25:48.194
Remember, they got that
big bust recently?

25:48.195 --> 25:49.728
It was, like, 50 kilos
of cocaine on the border?

25:49.731 --> 25:50.796
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:50.798 --> 25:51.930
Congratulations, Turner.

25:51.932 --> 25:53.097
On what?

25:53.099 --> 25:54.932
On your cushy new job
as the librarian

25:54.934 --> 25:57.167
when you become an inmate.

25:57.169 --> 25:59.636
You know,
for snitching to the cops.

25:59.638 --> 26:01.170
You can't do that.

26:01.172 --> 26:02.538
Oh, watch us.

26:02.540 --> 26:04.606
Hey...

26:04.608 --> 26:06.641
so why don't you tell us what
it is that Berkeley told you?

26:08.611 --> 26:10.243
(defibrillator whirring)

26:10.245 --> 26:12.278
Berkeley said
there was a backup

26:12.280 --> 26:14.847
GPS system on some ship.

26:14.849 --> 26:16.982
There's a laptop
pinging its location.

26:16.984 --> 26:17.983
Where?

26:17.985 --> 26:19.952
His sister's house.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.920
If Arkady has that laptop,
he knows where the tanker is.

26:21.922 --> 26:23.087
I'll call Callen and Sam.

26:23.089 --> 26:26.023
Oh, uh...
(clears his throat)

26:26.025 --> 26:28.592
good luck on the inside.

26:30.996 --> 26:32.562
Don't drop that soap!

26:34.599 --> 26:36.632
What if Elia didn't
give up the laptop

26:36.634 --> 26:38.800
and Arkady couldn't find it
before he had to bug off?

26:38.802 --> 26:41.269
It could still be at the house.
It's worth a shot.

26:41.271 --> 26:43.304
Find that laptop,
find the tanker.

26:43.306 --> 26:47.775
Back to Elia's.

26:47.777 --> 26:51.678
I told you last time
I hate this tiny room.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.713
How much longer
do I have to stay here?

26:53.715 --> 26:56.615
As soon as you tell me about
your buddy Charles Turner.

26:56.617 --> 26:58.583
Who is Turner?

26:58.585 --> 26:59.684
Prison guard.

26:59.686 --> 27:00.951
Victorville.

27:01.987 --> 27:05.922
Do I look like I associate
with prison guards?

27:05.924 --> 27:08.658
This prison guard called
your cell phone.

27:08.660 --> 27:10.626
Must've been a wrong number.

27:10.628 --> 27:12.861
The call lasted
three minutes and 22 seconds.

27:12.863 --> 27:15.763
Where is Callen?

27:15.765 --> 27:17.865
He'll be here.

27:17.867 --> 27:19.766
Am I being charged
with something?

27:19.768 --> 27:21.834
I'm busy man.

27:21.836 --> 27:25.604
Due time, due time.

27:25.606 --> 27:28.673
I thought we were friends.

27:28.675 --> 27:30.608
No, Callen and I are friends.

27:30.610 --> 27:32.743
He lets you hang around

27:32.745 --> 27:34.277
because of some ties
to the past.

27:34.279 --> 27:36.178
You're just a source to me.

27:45.188 --> 27:48.222
So if you have somewhere to be,
you're not gonna make it there

27:48.224 --> 27:50.224
unless you start
answering my questions.

27:50.226 --> 27:51.692
Okay.

27:51.694 --> 27:53.894
Ask questions.

27:53.896 --> 27:56.162
Where is the oil tanker?

27:56.164 --> 27:58.297
If I knew, I would tell you.

27:58.299 --> 28:01.233
Where's Elia Berkeley's laptop?

28:01.235 --> 28:03.868
(both chuckling)

28:06.739 --> 28:07.671
(mutters)

28:07.673 --> 28:09.005
Hmm?
(grunts)

28:09.007 --> 28:10.072
Yeah.

28:11.375 --> 28:13.942
(groaning)

28:13.944 --> 28:17.045
Not as fast as you
used to be, Arkady.

28:17.047 --> 28:20.014
This is out
of character,
even for you.

28:20.016 --> 28:21.982
You're desperate.

28:21.984 --> 28:24.718
Tell me why.
(groaning)

28:24.720 --> 28:27.187
You need to let me
out of here.

28:27.189 --> 28:29.222
Tell me why.

28:29.224 --> 28:30.756
(grunting)

28:30.758 --> 28:32.157
Suit yourself.

28:32.159 --> 28:33.725
Make yourself comfortable.

28:33.727 --> 28:35.793
You're gonna be here a while.

28:50.042 --> 28:53.243
Elia had to have been trying
to get back in on that oil deal.

28:53.245 --> 28:55.745
Well, she's got a hundred
million reasons to try.

28:55.747 --> 28:56.812
And she obviously didn't know
they were coming after her

28:56.814 --> 28:58.713
or she would've
gone into hiding.

28:58.715 --> 28:59.880
Clearly the Berkeleys
didn't know

28:59.882 --> 29:01.248
who they were getting
in bed with.

29:01.250 --> 29:02.882
Kens!

29:08.255 --> 29:10.121
Get down!

29:14.926 --> 29:17.326
You okay?
(groans, laughs)

29:17.328 --> 29:19.394
My bruises are gonna heal
faster than my hearing.

29:19.396 --> 29:21.095
Did you hit him?

29:21.097 --> 29:22.196
Yeah, I think I winged him.

29:22.198 --> 29:23.797
Car didn't have
any plates on it.

29:23.799 --> 29:25.698
(groans)

29:25.700 --> 29:27.700
(loudly): I said I think
I winged him; the car...
Yeah, I heard you!

29:27.702 --> 29:29.168
Okay, you don't have to,
you don't have to yell about it.

29:29.170 --> 29:31.236
My ears are fine.

29:42.215 --> 29:43.781
(door closes)

29:43.783 --> 29:45.082
Arkady give up anything?

29:45.084 --> 29:47.284
He took a swing at me.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.485
What?!

29:48.487 --> 29:50.320
Can you believe that?

29:50.322 --> 29:52.155
(laughs)

29:52.157 --> 29:53.856
He's pretty spry
for an old guy.

29:55.326 --> 29:57.893
What you gonna do?

29:57.895 --> 30:00.762
I have the distinct feeling that
Arkady's running out of time.

30:00.764 --> 30:01.796
(computer chirps)

30:01.798 --> 30:03.497
Hey, guys.

30:03.499 --> 30:04.865
What do you have, Eric?

30:04.867 --> 30:05.999
Footage of Arkady outside

30:06.001 --> 30:07.767
of Elia Berkeley's house
this morning.

30:07.769 --> 30:10.869
Took me a while to round up all
the neighbor's security footage.

30:12.305 --> 30:13.437
Thank you, Eric.

30:13.439 --> 30:15.839
My pleasure.

30:15.841 --> 30:17.307
Hate to say it,
but it looks like

30:17.309 --> 30:19.842
Arkady took out
Patrick and Elia Berkeley.

30:19.844 --> 30:21.210
Arkady's a broker.

30:21.212 --> 30:23.045
He's not a buyer or a seller.

30:23.047 --> 30:24.813
Maybe he was trying
to put the deal back together,

30:24.815 --> 30:26.981
and someone got
to the Berkeleys first.

30:26.983 --> 30:29.483
The same person
who T-boned Kensi and Deeks?

30:29.485 --> 30:31.852
It's got to be Karposev.

30:31.854 --> 30:33.987
Why would Arkady be so desperate
to get out of here?

30:33.989 --> 30:35.888
He could just kick back,

30:35.890 --> 30:37.489
let us take care of Karposev.

30:37.491 --> 30:39.224
There's got
to be another reason.

30:44.831 --> 30:45.996
You're holding me
against my will.

30:45.998 --> 30:47.497
This is not legal.

30:47.499 --> 30:49.532
Holding a murder suspect
is plenty legal.

30:49.534 --> 30:51.133
Murder? What murder?

30:51.135 --> 30:53.835
No, not just one--
Patrick and Elia Berkeley.

30:53.837 --> 30:56.537
Prison guards kill inmates
all the time.

30:56.539 --> 30:58.805
Had nothing
to do with me.

30:58.807 --> 30:59.872
Doesn't explain Elia.

30:59.874 --> 31:01.773
We have footage

31:01.775 --> 31:03.875
placing you outside her house
before she was murdered.

31:03.877 --> 31:07.044
Elia was alive when I got there,
and when I left.

31:07.046 --> 31:09.079
Where's the laptop?

31:09.081 --> 31:10.947
Better yet, what's on it?

31:12.884 --> 31:14.950
You working with Ivan Karposev?

31:14.952 --> 31:17.285
I thought you guys were supposed
to be smart.

31:17.287 --> 31:18.819
Then why don't you enlighten us?

31:20.155 --> 31:22.355
You want the tanker?

31:22.357 --> 31:23.856
Oh, you know where to find it.

31:25.459 --> 31:27.524
GPS location.

31:30.495 --> 31:32.561
I'll verify it.

31:35.299 --> 31:37.132
We're wasting time.

32:01.157 --> 32:03.223
I know you know what that is.

32:04.226 --> 32:05.558
I saw the same image

32:05.560 --> 32:08.060
on the clippings you gave me
from Hans Schrieber.

32:10.531 --> 32:14.866
We use these coins
to identify refugees wanting

32:14.868 --> 32:16.601
to escape from Russia.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.970
They would
hand them to me...

32:20.973 --> 32:23.440
...and I knew
I could trust them.

32:23.442 --> 32:26.109
Who gave the refugees the coins?

32:26.111 --> 32:29.046
The man on the other end.

32:31.383 --> 32:33.049
My father?

32:33.051 --> 32:35.084
Possibly.

32:36.487 --> 32:38.954
But I cannot say
for sure, Callen.

32:46.062 --> 32:48.128
What happened to
Elia Berkeley?

32:49.231 --> 32:54.099
Karposev didn't want any
complications with the oil sale.

32:54.101 --> 32:57.102
Sadly, Elia was
a complication.

32:57.104 --> 32:58.269
And what about you?

32:58.271 --> 33:00.037
Karposev cannot touch me.

33:01.306 --> 33:03.306
Benefits of being connected.

33:05.443 --> 33:07.109
Prove to me

33:07.111 --> 33:10.178
that you're not just trying
to pin all this Karposev.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.247
I have an associate on the crew.

33:13.249 --> 33:14.581
Check my phone.

33:14.583 --> 33:16.583
Remember the girl?

33:16.585 --> 33:17.750
Anna.

33:17.752 --> 33:20.018
Anna.

33:20.020 --> 33:21.352
Yes.

33:21.354 --> 33:23.487
Karposev sent a video.

33:23.489 --> 33:26.056
She's in danger.

33:26.058 --> 33:27.524
Well, this associate must
be pretty important

33:27.526 --> 33:29.259
for you to stick
your neck out like this.

33:29.261 --> 33:32.729
I am loyal to the people
who work for me.

33:40.771 --> 33:42.771
I don't buy it.

33:42.773 --> 33:44.539
It is true.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.124
You guys all right?

34:04.126 --> 34:06.126
Still in one piece.

34:06.128 --> 34:09.194
Okay, LAPD got a call
about a shooting.

34:11.698 --> 34:13.030
DEEKS:
Wait a minute.

34:13.032 --> 34:15.365
Isn't that the car
that rammed us?

34:15.367 --> 34:17.400
There's Ivan Karposev.

34:17.402 --> 34:19.068
DEEKS:
The Devil himself.

34:19.070 --> 34:21.102
Look at this shoulder--
I knew I winged him.

34:23.806 --> 34:26.406
DEEKS:
Tell me he's not gonna...

34:26.408 --> 34:28.141
Mm-hmm.

34:29.244 --> 34:31.277
(clears throat)

34:31.279 --> 34:34.413
That guy was supposed to find
the laptop and didn't deliver.

34:34.415 --> 34:37.182
This is what happens when you
come back empty-handed.

34:37.184 --> 34:39.150
KENSI:
Arkady didn't kill Elia.

34:39.152 --> 34:40.818
Karposev did.

34:40.820 --> 34:42.386
I'll call the guys.

34:49.728 --> 34:51.394
(anxious gasping)

34:51.396 --> 34:53.329
CALLEN:
He's telling the truth.

34:53.331 --> 34:55.230
Her name's Anna.

34:55.232 --> 34:57.165
If Arkady didn't kill Elia,

34:57.167 --> 34:58.566
he probably didn't kill
Patrick, either.

34:58.568 --> 35:01.835
So I triple-checked Arkady's
GPS coordinates--

35:01.837 --> 35:05.170
it's the middle
of the Sahara Desert.

35:06.673 --> 35:08.205
He's playing us.

35:08.207 --> 35:10.106
No, he's too desperate
to play us.

35:12.143 --> 35:14.209
He's bargaining.

35:14.211 --> 35:16.711
He wants something in return.

35:16.713 --> 35:18.612
It's time to find out
what it is.

35:24.853 --> 35:26.853
It's funny...

35:26.855 --> 35:28.521
coordinates you
gave us put the tanker

35:28.523 --> 35:30.189
in the middle of
the Sahara Desert.

35:30.191 --> 35:31.757
Must have been typo.

35:31.759 --> 35:33.091
Try again.

35:33.093 --> 35:35.693
No typos this time.

35:37.196 --> 35:39.196
No typos...

35:39.198 --> 35:40.397
if you take me with you.

35:40.399 --> 35:43.500
By the time
you find Karposev,

35:43.502 --> 35:46.603
he will have unloaded the oil,
and he will be gone.

35:46.605 --> 35:48.637
And your associate with him.

35:51.475 --> 35:53.475
Does not have to be this way.

35:53.477 --> 35:54.876
Deal?

36:00.283 --> 36:01.615
Deal.

36:01.617 --> 36:03.249
I have your word?

36:03.251 --> 36:05.417
You just have
to trust us.
Okay.

36:05.419 --> 36:07.485
Let's do this.

36:08.488 --> 36:10.187
Come on.

36:13.125 --> 36:15.191
ERIC:
Ready when you are.

36:18.362 --> 36:20.362
Latitude: 33.4.

36:20.364 --> 36:22.430
Longitude: 118.2.

36:27.869 --> 36:29.535
That's San Pedro.

36:29.537 --> 36:31.603
Ship's still in port, in L.A.

37:00.433 --> 37:03.233
He stays with
the truck.
We had deal.

37:03.235 --> 37:05.301
The deal was
we bring you with us.
And we did.

37:05.303 --> 37:07.836
Now the deal is you stay here.
Let's move.

37:36.967 --> 37:39.233
¶ ¶

37:55.684 --> 37:58.317
One, two, three.

38:03.590 --> 38:06.424
KENSI: Must be
the remaining crew members.

38:13.966 --> 38:16.766
Deeks, $100 million in oil is
about a million barrels, right?

38:16.768 --> 38:18.768
I mean, I don't have
my Acme oil converter,

38:18.770 --> 38:20.603
but according to Eric and Nell,
yeah, that's about right.

38:20.605 --> 38:22.371
KENSI: There's only
97 barrels here.

38:22.373 --> 38:24.373
That means
we're too late.

38:24.375 --> 38:26.608
Callen, Sam, Karposev's
already moved the oil.

38:27.277 --> 38:28.509
Shooter!

38:31.747 --> 38:33.646
DEEKS:
Split up.

38:43.290 --> 38:44.322
DEEKS:
Down!

38:46.492 --> 38:47.491
(man groans)

38:47.493 --> 38:48.492
KENSI:
Stay down.

38:48.494 --> 38:49.559
Stay down.

38:50.495 --> 38:51.560
Let's go!
Turn over.

38:56.499 --> 38:58.298
I got him, Kens.

39:02.337 --> 39:03.336
Deeks!

39:03.338 --> 39:04.470
Yeah?

39:04.472 --> 39:05.771
This place is rigged to blow.

39:08.976 --> 39:10.475
How much time?

39:10.477 --> 39:11.809
I don't see a timer.

39:11.811 --> 39:13.510
They haven't set
a detonator, yet.

39:13.512 --> 39:15.311
All right, let's get him
to Sam and Callen now.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.946
(man grunts, groans)

39:44.073 --> 39:46.406
Clear.
What you mean, "clear"?

39:47.842 --> 39:49.374
You almost got yourself shot.

39:49.376 --> 39:50.341
We told you
to stay in the truck.

39:50.343 --> 39:51.843
Where's the guard?

39:51.844 --> 39:53.344
I'm still plenty fast
for old man.

39:53.346 --> 39:54.812
KENSI (over radio):
Callen, Sam, we're coming in.

39:58.884 --> 40:00.083
Who's this?

40:00.085 --> 40:01.751
We found him rigging
the ship to blow.

40:01.753 --> 40:03.619
Get down.

40:03.621 --> 40:04.953
Where is rest
of crew?

40:04.955 --> 40:06.587
Karposev got to them
before we got here.

40:06.589 --> 40:08.922
Was there woman?
No, there was no woman.

40:08.924 --> 40:10.390
W-What is he doing here?

40:10.392 --> 40:11.991
Told him
to wait in the car.

40:14.495 --> 40:15.944
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

40:15.945 --> 40:17.394
Where is she?!
Where is my Anna?!

40:19.432 --> 40:20.731
What do you mean
"your Anna"?

40:26.772 --> 40:28.972
She's your daughter.

40:30.875 --> 40:33.876
Yes, Callen.

40:33.878 --> 40:35.611
She is my daughter.

40:37.648 --> 40:40.382
And this man knows
where she is.

40:44.987 --> 40:46.353
SAM:
Where's Karposev?

40:46.355 --> 40:47.554
Where's the girl?

40:50.125 --> 40:51.457
Fine.

40:51.459 --> 40:52.724
He's all yours,
Arkady.

40:52.726 --> 40:54.559
Let's go.
Wait, wait, wait!

40:56.362 --> 40:57.661
Karposev took her with him.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.462
Where?

40:59.464 --> 41:00.796
To Russia.

41:00.798 --> 41:02.998
That's where the auction
for the oil's taking place.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.567
Where is the oil now?

41:05.569 --> 41:06.801
It's gone.

41:06.803 --> 41:08.369
We off-loaded
most of it

41:08.371 --> 41:12.406
onto three smaller
tankers, out at sea.

41:12.408 --> 41:14.074
(laughing):
You'll never find them.

41:14.076 --> 41:16.409
The ships were
never flagged.

41:16.411 --> 41:18.644
Don't know where they're from,
where they're going.

41:18.646 --> 41:20.012
So why'd you bring
the ship back to L.A.?

41:20.014 --> 41:21.013
Where's the rest
of the oil?

41:21.015 --> 41:23.548
The cartels bought the rest.

41:23.550 --> 41:25.516
We were set to
sail the ship

41:25.518 --> 41:27.751
back to sea and blow it
with the oil we kept.

41:27.753 --> 41:29.419
And the world thinks
the oil blew with it.

41:29.421 --> 41:30.720
Makes for an easier sell.

41:30.722 --> 41:33.055
Karposev sells that oil
for $100 million,

41:33.057 --> 41:35.091
he becomes a next-level threat.

41:35.093 --> 41:38.260
My contacts in Russia
can track Karposev,

41:38.262 --> 41:40.829
if only...

41:40.831 --> 41:44.499
you help me find
my daughter Anna.

41:53.643 --> 41:55.175
I don't like it.

41:55.177 --> 41:59.112
Arkady's contacts may be our
best shot at getting Karposev.

42:00.515 --> 42:02.848
Okay.

42:02.850 --> 42:07.752
Find Anna, we find Karposev,
stop the sale.

42:08.688 --> 42:10.621
I hate to admit it,

42:10.623 --> 42:12.623
but we need him.
