NARRATOR:<i> Previously on </i>Boston Legal...

00:02.502 --> 00:05.463
Why do you smell of sex, Denise?
Is it Brad?

00:05.547 --> 00:08.174
-Did you tell anybody?
-How could he possibly know?

00:08.258 --> 00:11.011
-What?
-This time I detect both Brad and Jeffrey.

00:11.094 --> 00:14.556
-What happened with Sandy?
-She just didn't like me that way.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.057
There will be women who do.

00:16.141 --> 00:19.602
If Bethany's out, I am hugely available.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.687
Can I take you to dinner?

00:20.770 --> 00:22.063
Well, actually, I'm getting on a plane.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.565
-Where are you going?
-Hawaii.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.275
-Is it my mother?
-Yes.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.735
I hope I didn't hurt her.

00:27.777 --> 00:30.989
-(groans)
-Tell Bella, she better watch her back.

00:32.282 --> 00:35.744
(rock music playing)

00:41.875 --> 00:43.877
-BELLA: Denny!
-Bella.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.088
You look blue.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.466
I've been attacked by vicious terrorists.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.384
-Terrorists?
-Eco-terrorists.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.679
You need to go to court and get
me a restraining order, Denny,

00:54.763 --> 00:55.847
and I want it done today.

00:55.930 --> 00:58.308
Bella, you look blue.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.102
I am blue. The C.O.T.A,

01:01.186 --> 01:03.897
Coalition Opposed
to the Testing of Animals,

01:03.980 --> 01:05.231
they've been after me for years.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.816
-Why?
-My company.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.903
I own plum cosmetics,
"Makeup for the robust woman."

01:10.403 --> 01:12.447
-I don't use them.
-I can tell.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.825
They claim we experiment
on animals to test our products.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.286
-Do you?
-Well, of course we do.

01:18.369 --> 01:20.830
We have to ensure the makeup
is safe, for God's sake!

01:21.081 --> 01:25.126
I have just had enough of these psycho,
animal-loving, liberal thugs!

01:25.210 --> 01:26.920
-(gunshot)
-(screams)

01:27.003 --> 01:28.505
-Oh!
-Damn.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.924
-Denny, give me the gun.
-It's mine.

01:34.010 --> 01:36.513
-Hey!
-I want you both to get them.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.641
I'm unavailable, Bella. I apologize.

01:40.558 --> 01:41.810
Why not?

01:42.310 --> 01:45.105
Because I have more fun things
to do than represent you. That's all.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.899
-Such as?
-Uh, root canal.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.401
Maybe I could stick something
really sharp in my eye,

01:50.485 --> 01:51.820
the simple pleasures.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.322
I want you and the other
name partners of this firm

01:54.405 --> 01:55.281
representing me.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.075
I'm not representing you, Bella.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.120
-Denny!
-One moment, cupcake. Shirley!

02:01.621 --> 02:05.667
(whispers) Shirley, when the woman
is unhappy, the man is rarely satisfied.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.086
I'll let you play with my gun.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.798
Your gun goes off
too prematurely for me, Denny.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.008
-It always has.
-(gasps)

02:17.178 --> 02:20.765

03:02.056 --> 03:03.224
Vanessa...

03:04.142 --> 03:06.227
You're wearing a yellow dress.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.645
How could you tell?

03:08.563 --> 03:10.398
-It's lovely.
-Thank you.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.447
Could we get you to put your tongue
back in your mouth there, soldier?

03:18.573 --> 03:21.284
Thank goodness we have you, Brad,
to keep track of our tongues.

03:21.367 --> 03:24.204
Would you like a list of all the places
mine has been this week?

03:24.579 --> 03:25.788
Perv.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.291
Brad, not to start up trouble,

03:28.374 --> 03:30.460
but you're not the only one,
you do realize that?

03:31.461 --> 03:33.922
-What are you talking about?
-I'm sure you can figure it out.

03:37.717 --> 03:38.843
You're not the only one.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.148
(knocking on door)

03:53.233 --> 03:55.818
I just got off the phone
with the D.A.'s office.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.154
-They picked up a Mr.--
-Steinkellner.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.657
Yes, and while he is officially denying

04:00.740 --> 04:03.034
that C.O.T.A. painted you blue,

04:03.117 --> 04:05.286
the coalition condones and supports it,

04:05.370 --> 04:07.288
thinks you look good in a primary color

04:07.372 --> 04:09.332
and is in fact calling for a second coat.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.125
They're not gonna stop until I'm dead.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.753
You need to do something now.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.716
(whispers)
I feel a wintry frost blowing my way.

04:20.218 --> 04:21.803
Okay, I'll try to set up a meeting.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.514
In the meantime,
maybe you could either try to talk her off

04:24.597 --> 04:25.807
the ledge or push her over.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.558
I heard that.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.436
She's jealous 'cause I've aged better.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.856
Bella, maybe those people
aren't protesting your cosmetics

04:33.940 --> 04:35.858
so much as you being you.

04:36.985 --> 04:40.321
You might keep in mind
that should I marry Denny,

04:40.738 --> 04:42.323
I'll have a stake in this firm.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.493
Unless someone manages to drive
that stake through your heart,

04:45.576 --> 04:46.828
small target that it is.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.414
You want to adjourn to the powder room?

04:49.497 --> 04:52.458
Bella, I'm the senior partner
in a law firm.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.503
I sit on the board of directors
of a university,

04:55.586 --> 04:57.046
two museums and a hospital.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.840
(stutters) I consider myself

04:58.923 --> 05:02.051
an intelligent,
civilized and dignified person.

05:02.135 --> 05:06.139
All of which is to say that if you and I
were to adjourn to the powder room,

05:06.222 --> 05:08.850
I would kick your over-the-top ass.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.103
I'm aroused.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.246
(clears throat)

05:32.165 --> 05:34.334
-May I speak with you?
-Sure.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.255
I was thinking about what you said,

05:39.672 --> 05:42.633
about how there will be women out there

05:42.717 --> 05:45.011
who like me for me.

05:45.845 --> 05:46.721
I said that?

05:48.389 --> 05:50.391
(chuckles) I'm kidding.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.394
Of course those women are out there,

05:53.478 --> 05:55.521
lots of women, Clarence.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.274
I was wondering, uh...

05:58.358 --> 06:00.401
(clears throat) ...whether you...

06:01.903 --> 06:03.154
might be one of them.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.707
(sighs)

06:15.458 --> 06:17.710
Gee, I wonder where Clarence
could have gone.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.128
(chuckles)

06:20.463 --> 06:22.048
Take off the bag, Clarence.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.307
-Am I fired?
-No, you work for me.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.394
I'm willing to quit
if it affects your decision.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.648
I don't want you to quit.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.151
And I'd love to go out with you.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.823
-Really?
-Really.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.997
I need to go to the bathroom right now.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.502
Men's room, Clarence.

07:06.926 --> 07:07.927
(knocking on door)

07:11.139 --> 07:12.473
Um, Mr. Crane?

07:13.766 --> 07:14.684
Um... (clears throat)

07:14.767 --> 07:16.727
My name is, uh, Matthew Steinkellner.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.731
-You wanted to see me?
-You're the man who attacked Bella?

07:20.815 --> 07:22.900
(stutters) No.
I've never attacked anybody, okay?

07:22.984 --> 07:23.943
There must be some mistake.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.404
You made it, son.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.406
Here's a piece of advice,

07:28.865 --> 07:30.908
your group needs to stop
targeting Bella Horowitz.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.871
I say this not only out of concern
for her life, but for yours.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.832
(stutters)
I'm sorry. That sounds like a threat.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.960
I mean, is that legal for attorneys
to make threats like that?

07:41.043 --> 07:42.170
Here's another piece of advice,

07:42.253 --> 07:43.254
always have your lawyer with you.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.006
That way, when I deny
having said something,

07:45.089 --> 07:46.841
which I typically do,
you'll have a witness.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.135
Well, actually...

07:54.015 --> 07:57.435
I will mop up the courtroom floor
with you, you fat old man.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.187
What's going on here?

07:59.270 --> 08:01.647
Well, well, well. Princess hideous<i>.</i>

08:02.315 --> 08:04.317
She's representing the man
who painted you blue.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.360
You got a problem with that?

08:06.444 --> 08:09.572
Bethany, no matter what
our differences, sweetheart,

08:09.655 --> 08:12.783
I certainly never brought you up
to represent terrorists.

08:12.867 --> 08:15.870
This has nothing to do
with who I'm defending, queenie.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.289
This is about who I'm going after.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.249
Come on, Matthew.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.054
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

08:33.137 --> 08:34.597
Where's Shirley and Denny?

08:34.680 --> 08:36.682
-They just left for court.
-What's going on?

08:36.766 --> 08:40.645
What is going on is your presence
is hereby requested,

08:40.728 --> 08:42.480
check that, required

08:42.563 --> 08:46.192
at our office costume party
this Thursday night.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.652
A costume party?

08:47.735 --> 08:51.656
I have taken the liberty of hiring
a consultant for the purpose

08:51.739 --> 08:53.115
of improving office morale.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.910
Evidently, costume parties are gold.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.663
Moreover, I want each of you to dress up

08:58.746 --> 09:01.123
as somebody whose values or strengths

09:01.207 --> 09:02.959
you like to imbue yourselves with.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.878
Where's the fun in that
if we all come dressed as you?

09:06.420 --> 09:09.257
The point is to reveal
a little of yourself

09:09.340 --> 09:12.510
to your coworkers,
and I am serious about this.

09:12.593 --> 09:15.096
-I want you all to make an effort.
-This is so high school.

09:15.179 --> 09:18.266
As opposed to you and Jeffrey
slugging it out in the men's room?

09:18.349 --> 09:19.517
-I won.
-Did not.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.102
-Shut up.
-There's some morale.

09:21.477 --> 09:24.981
You will all be there in costume,
no exceptions.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.190
That is all.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.820
-Denise, can I ask you something?
-Sure.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.322
You sleeping with anybody else?

09:34.115 --> 09:36.075
Uh, first of all,
that's a personal question.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.243
Well, you're sleeping with me,
so I thought I should--

09:37.326 --> 09:38.494
(shushes)

09:40.037 --> 09:41.038
You and I have an arrangement.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.000
-No exclusivity, no--
-Fine, but there are safety concerns.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.877
You can assume that any sex
I am having is safe,

09:46.961 --> 09:48.838
not that I'm having any of it
separate and apart from you.

09:48.921 --> 09:49.922
Are you sleeping
with somebody else in this office?

09:50.006 --> 09:52.049
-I'm not having this conversation.
-Denise, I will not be made a fool of.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.593
Are you sleeping
with somebody else in this office?

09:53.676 --> 09:55.511
If you no longer want
to sleep with me, that's fine.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.389
I'll miss it, but I'm not
answering these questions.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.398
He may deny that he did it,
but he's behind it.

10:07.481 --> 10:10.192
His little group has been harassing me
and my company for years,

10:10.276 --> 10:12.570
and now he's hired my own daughter

10:12.653 --> 10:13.821
to further aggravate me.

10:13.904 --> 10:17.366
Objection.
I agreed to aggravate you for free.

10:17.867 --> 10:21.996
Hold on. I don't allow people to play out
family problems in my courtroom.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.457
Just what is it you want from me?

10:24.874 --> 10:26.083
I want a restraining order

10:26.167 --> 10:28.919
keeping that man's flock
of protesters away from me.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.922
They carry their placards
outside my corporate headquarters.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.383
They say that we kill and torture animals.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.720
They verbally assault anybody
going in or out of our building.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.513
I'm losing business.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.308
(stutters) I'm losing clients.
I'm losing employees.

10:42.391 --> 10:43.768
I mean, enough is enough.

10:43.851 --> 10:44.852
Thank you, Bella.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.857
She's all yours, my little friend.

10:55.696 --> 10:59.241
The truth is, you do kill
and torture animals. Do you not?

10:59.325 --> 11:04.288
We test our products on animals, yes,
but it is to save human lives.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.415
Oh, you're a humanitarian?

11:06.749 --> 11:08.959
Hold on just one second.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.047
-Are you a midget?
-Are you an imbecile?

11:13.881 --> 11:15.549
-Uh, objection.
-Sustained.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.261
-Your company uses rabbits?
-Like many do.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.431
You lock them in stocks
so just their heads stick out.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.308
You clip their eyelids open

11:24.392 --> 11:26.394
and pour chemicals into their eyes,

11:26.477 --> 11:28.187
while they're left there for two weeks

11:28.270 --> 11:30.898
to experience ulceration, bleeding

11:30.981 --> 11:33.275
and massive iris deterioration.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.027
Your Honor, the rabbits like it.

11:36.904 --> 11:40.700
Do you not subject these animals
to excruciating pain?

11:41.283 --> 11:44.203
The rabbits,
which are from the rodent family,

11:44.662 --> 11:46.747
do experience some discomfiture,

11:46.831 --> 11:50.334
but once again,
it is to save human suffering.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.504
And what's human suffering to you,
going without blush?

11:54.588 --> 11:56.257
-Objection.
-Overruled.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.883
-Objection.
-Sustained.

11:57.967 --> 12:01.011
Sometimes the rabbits
break their own necks

12:01.095 --> 12:02.722
trying to escape.

12:02.805 --> 12:06.726
You're saying that my client
doesn't have the right to protest that?

12:07.601 --> 12:09.854
You're saying you do
all this to be humane?

12:12.398 --> 12:16.444
Well, I guess people can justify
all types of bad behavior,

12:17.153 --> 12:18.946
can't they, Bella?

12:21.449 --> 12:22.783
It's getting ugly.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.619
Denny Crane ugly.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.884
So what gave you the nerve to ask me out?

12:39.967 --> 12:42.094
-Oh, I don't know.
-Yes, you do.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.765
Well, it seemed we both have
a lot in common.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.267
-Such as?
-Well... (chuckles)

12:48.350 --> 12:50.019
We both kind of have shells.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.396
Mine's Clarice or Oprah.

12:52.938 --> 12:57.902
Yours, you just have a regular old
hard shell to protect yourself.

13:01.572 --> 13:02.490
Who hurt you?

13:03.491 --> 13:07.244
Nobody. I'm just a tough New York broad.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.288
Who hurt you?

13:13.626 --> 13:15.461
Well, for starters, my father.

13:16.879 --> 13:17.713
He abused you?

13:18.589 --> 13:21.300
Not sexually but physically,

13:22.259 --> 13:24.929
and you're the first person
I've ever told that to,

13:25.846 --> 13:28.265
outside of a few who charge
by the hour to listen.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.145
-Who hurt you?
-Oh, I don't remember.

13:33.729 --> 13:37.233
My mother says I was bullied in preschool.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.819
I either blocked it out,
or I just don't remember.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.114
I do remember I grew up
with a lot of imaginary friends.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.032
Mm.

13:45.115 --> 13:48.244
I never felt lonely alone,
but with people...

13:48.327 --> 13:51.080
-Do you stay in touch?
-I'm sorry?

13:52.248 --> 13:53.749
With your imaginary friends.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.167
(laughs)

13:55.251 --> 13:57.503
Uh, well, uh, some.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.505
We have reunions.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.006
Uh...

14:02.675 --> 14:03.759
Am I too weird?

14:06.095 --> 14:07.555
You're just weird enough.

14:09.431 --> 14:10.266
(chuckles)

14:16.146 --> 14:18.774
-It's Coho, isn't it?
-I beg your pardon?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.025
You're having sex with Jeffrey Coho.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.405
The only part of my sex life
that is any of your business

14:24.488 --> 14:26.198
is the part that involves you.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.367
-Just tell me if it's him.
-Denise...

14:29.034 --> 14:32.621
Everything all right?
You look a little overextended.

14:50.180 --> 14:53.058
I'm sure there's a long,
very complicated answer,

14:53.142 --> 14:55.269
but what is your problem?

14:55.352 --> 14:57.897
(chuckles) You're right.

14:59.231 --> 15:04.653
It's a long, very complicated answer.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.131
I had a wonderful time. He's a great guy.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.758
Isn't he a little tender for you?

15:25.841 --> 15:27.051
I like tender.

15:27.134 --> 15:28.928
-Just because I'm not doesn't mean--
-BRAD: Hey!

15:29.011 --> 15:30.721
-You got a sec?
-(clicks tongue)

15:31.388 --> 15:32.514
I guess.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.059
Listen, I realize
we're not exactly friends.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.144
Yeah, I was hoping to make
progress at the costume party.

15:37.227 --> 15:40.397
-Yeah, could you step into the closet?
-Excuse me?

15:40.481 --> 15:41.565
I want to have a conversation
with you in private.

15:41.649 --> 15:42.691
Just step into the closet, please.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.818
I didn't know
you were out of the closet, Brad.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.285
Are you and Denise
having intimate relations?

15:53.994 --> 15:55.621
-Why would you ask me that?
-Are you?

15:55.704 --> 15:56.872
Are you?

15:57.748 --> 15:58.874
Matter of fact, I am.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.420
-Answer my question, please.
-I will not answer your question.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.967
Do you know what wildfire ink is, Jeff?

16:08.050 --> 16:10.052
It's a chemical used
to find certain evidence

16:10.135 --> 16:11.679
under ultraviolet light, Brad.

16:11.762 --> 16:12.596
You get a gold star.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.182
It also lights up when it's mixed
with certain types of oils,

16:15.265 --> 16:17.893
some of which are very difficult
to get off your hands.

16:18.352 --> 16:22.064
Excellent. I'm sure that would be
very interesting if I cared.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.566
I rubbed some of those oils
on Denise's hands.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.444
Excuse me?

16:28.028 --> 16:30.698
This is a portable ultraviolet light.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.491
Do you have anything
you'd like to tell me, Jeff?

16:32.574 --> 16:34.201
Only that you're insane, Brad.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.453
I'm gonna turn off the light
to the closet.

16:36.537 --> 16:39.039
Let's see if Denise's hands
have been anywhere near you.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.250
I take that back. You're really insane.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.021
This is awkward.

17:05.274 --> 17:06.608
You don't like animal testing?

17:06.692 --> 17:08.110
C.O.T.A. is against
animal cruelty of any kind--

17:08.193 --> 17:09.570
You paint people blue?

17:09.653 --> 17:11.280
But somebody else beat us to Bella.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.533
-The protest at my client's company?
-That was us.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.827
You throw blood on people wearing furs.

17:16.910 --> 17:20.414
-Uh, it's, uh, dye, but point taken.
-People wearing synthetic furs.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.083
-Well, they promote the fashion.
-People who eat meat.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.418
-Slaughterhouses.
-Leather.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.586
-An animal's hide. Same.
-Wool.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.796
-Football?
-Skin of a pig.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.923
-Cancer research?
-Oh, come on!

17:30.007 --> 17:32.259
This case doesn't involve cancer research.

17:32.342 --> 17:35.471
She tortures rabbits
to make a better mascara.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.056
What the hell is going on here?

17:37.890 --> 17:40.976
What's going on is that we're both
in love with the same man.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.352
It's not you, Judge.

17:42.853 --> 17:47.900
-I am not in love with him.
-Silence! I'm very confused.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.784
You know what bothers me
about this case, Denny?

17:58.035 --> 17:59.787
That you've come between
a mother and a daughter.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.331
I know. It was always such a fantasy.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.877
You've got the power
to settle this, you know.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.087
I don't think so.

18:08.170 --> 18:12.591
Bella would sue me for malpractice
if I counseled her to drop the case now.

18:12.674 --> 18:15.302
-Why?
-Because I'm getting ready to drop Bella.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.763
Really? But she's so sweet.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.474
I can't shake Bethany.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.893
Maybe it's that tight little ass,

18:23.519 --> 18:27.064
those big breasts, normal-size head.

18:27.147 --> 18:30.984
Why is it men become such fools
over the normal-size head?

18:31.068 --> 18:33.904
I'm getting ready to drop
the big one for the little one.

18:35.155 --> 18:39.243
-It's gonna get ugly, Shirley.
-Denny Crane ugly.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.036
Mm-hmm.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.752
Now I'm intrigued.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.423
So what's the answer?

18:58.178 --> 18:59.263
(chuckles)

19:03.600 --> 19:07.354
When I was a sophomore in high school,

19:08.147 --> 19:11.650
I attended my very first dance.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.237
There was this girl

19:16.738 --> 19:20.159
standing across the dance floor

19:21.743 --> 19:23.370
wearing a yellow dress.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.583
She was so beautiful.

19:30.002 --> 19:34.798
I didn't have the courage
to ask her to dance,

19:35.090 --> 19:38.927
perhaps for fear of the long,
lonely walk back across the gym floor

19:39.011 --> 19:40.512
after being refused.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.934
I finally willed myself to go ask,

19:47.895 --> 19:49.813
and then suddenly she...

19:50.898 --> 19:53.066
was gone in a...

19:54.693 --> 19:55.611
fleeting second.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.988
She must have left.

19:59.656 --> 20:03.452
I began to imagine
what she must have been like,

20:03.869 --> 20:05.579
her laugh, certainly her kiss.

20:05.662 --> 20:10.000
I still know exactly what that feels like,

20:12.044 --> 20:14.463
though I've... I've never felt it.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.428
She's been a figment for...

20:23.889 --> 20:25.224
29 years,

20:27.017 --> 20:29.603
an imagined standard
by which all other women

20:29.686 --> 20:33.232
seem to have fallen terribly short.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.695
How could they not
after I've individualized her

20:39.780 --> 20:45.118
with every quality I so long for?

20:49.456 --> 20:51.458
I've never met the girl
in the yellow dress.

20:53.543 --> 20:54.962
Seeing you, I guess, it just...

21:02.886 --> 21:03.887
(chuckles)

21:05.180 --> 21:08.725
Here I am, revealing a little of myself
even before the costume party.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.005
How dare you? Rubbing me with chemicals?

21:38.088 --> 21:40.841
When I choose a restaurant,
I like to know who else eats there.

21:42.050 --> 21:44.553
Whoo! Way to a man's heart.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.222
You ever try blindsiding him
in the kidneys?

21:51.101 --> 21:54.187
Bella, we're supposed to be in court.
Denny's already left.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.732
Yes, I was hoping
to grab you for a second.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.359
-By the throat?
-Ick. Too much dead tissue.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.528
(chuckles) What do you want, Bella?

22:08.035 --> 22:11.413
I think you probably know
I don't like you.

22:12.372 --> 22:13.832
There have been signs.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.960
Well, the reason is because

22:17.336 --> 22:20.255
I've always known
how much Denny loved you.

22:21.381 --> 22:23.050
He never loved me that way,

22:23.925 --> 22:25.510
but I seem to be making progress.

22:27.846 --> 22:28.680
Anyway,

22:30.432 --> 22:32.392
Denny holds you in a light that...

22:34.519 --> 22:36.605
Well, Shirley, it's... it's this simple.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.608
Denny still seeks your approval.

22:40.942 --> 22:43.445
I would be forever grateful if...

22:44.696 --> 22:46.406
you would approve of me.

22:48.575 --> 22:50.077
I love him, Shirley,

22:51.453 --> 22:52.704
more than anything.

22:58.794 --> 23:02.255
-You have got to be kidding me.
-I'm sorry, Ms. Simms,

23:02.339 --> 23:05.175
but the New York Yankees take pride
in being very humorless.

23:05.258 --> 23:06.551
I say that off the record, of course.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.845
I simply cannot allow you
to display their logo

23:08.929 --> 23:11.515
without approval,
for which I'll need a written request.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.350
What's going on?

23:13.433 --> 23:16.436
-This little peanut somehow found out--
-My name is Mr. Prig.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.981
This Mr. Prig somehow found out

23:20.065 --> 23:22.275
that I got a Yankees costume
for our party.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.486
He's threatening to enjoin me
from wearing it.

23:24.861 --> 23:26.530
We take ourselves very seriously.

23:26.613 --> 23:29.241
-What if I do wear it?
-Well, now that you have notice,

23:29.324 --> 23:31.576
we could avail ourselves
of punitive damages,

23:31.660 --> 23:33.537
and I'm a very punitive little Prig.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.540
(Clarice voice)
Look here, you little gnome,

23:36.623 --> 23:38.375
you need to busy yourself
with something important,

23:38.458 --> 23:41.169
like buying up the best players
on the free agent market,

23:41.253 --> 23:45.132
so you can win championships,
keep your pompous asses all buffed,

23:45.215 --> 23:47.801
allow your fans to feel good
about themselves,

23:47.884 --> 23:51.930
even though most of 'em can't spell
and have mug shots!

23:52.889 --> 23:53.890
(squeaks)

23:58.186 --> 24:00.772
What did I say about Clarice
coming in here?

24:00.856 --> 24:02.232
Sorry, he seemed to be picking on you,

24:02.315 --> 24:04.609
-and she just took over.
-I don't want her to take over,

24:04.693 --> 24:06.820
as your boss and especially
as your girlfriend.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.366
-What?
-Are you...

24:13.243 --> 24:14.828
Are you my girlfriend?

24:15.871 --> 24:16.746
Um...

24:21.960 --> 24:24.171
My client isn't protesting
against a doctor

24:24.254 --> 24:25.922
trying to cure AIDS here.

24:26.006 --> 24:29.759
He isn't singling out a hunter
trying to provide food for his family.

24:30.177 --> 24:33.388
He's going after a billion-dollar
cosmetics company

24:33.472 --> 24:36.266
that tortures rabbits
in the name of makeup.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.478
There are all kinds
of alternative testing methods

24:39.561 --> 24:42.522
and thousands of ingredients
that can be safely used

24:42.606 --> 24:44.983
to make the same products
without hurting animals.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.778
Revlon does it. Avon, Clinique.

24:49.905 --> 24:53.783
But not big Bella. She just doesn't care.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.870
We try to pass ourselves off

24:56.953 --> 24:58.747
as a compassionate people, Your Honor.

24:59.789 --> 25:03.460
We prioritize kindness
as one of the most important values

25:03.543 --> 25:05.337
to instill in our children.

25:05.420 --> 25:06.796
Integrity is another.

25:07.547 --> 25:12.385
Where is either in making animals suffer
in the name of our personal vanity?

25:13.303 --> 25:17.140
At some point, people have to stand up
and say, "This is wrong."

25:17.724 --> 25:21.186
That man and his coalition
stand up every day.

25:21.937 --> 25:26.525
My God, the question can't always be,
"How much money do we want to make?"

25:26.608 --> 25:28.985
It should be, "Who do we want to be?"

25:31.154 --> 25:32.697
SHIRLEY: We're a funny people, Your Honor.

25:33.573 --> 25:36.451
We have all these feel-good movies
about animals,

25:36.535 --> 25:40.330
whether it be<i> Old Yeller</i>
or saving the whales

25:40.413 --> 25:42.916
or penguins marching off
to wherever they march to.

25:42.999 --> 25:45.460
I must admit, I didn't get
my Academy screener on that one.

25:46.127 --> 25:50.632
And every May, we drink mint juleps
and dress up in fancy clothes

25:50.715 --> 25:56.054
and wear silly hats as thoroughbreds
are led out like royalty

25:56.137 --> 25:57.264
for the Kentucky Derby.

25:57.347 --> 25:59.057
My God, we treat them with such reverence.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.769
Never mind that a two-year-old
thoroughbred's bones

26:02.852 --> 26:05.939
aren't fully developed enough
to withstand such a pounding,

26:06.022 --> 26:07.857
and we certainly don't talk about how,

26:07.941 --> 26:11.403
after they stop competing,
many racehorses are slaughtered.

26:11.861 --> 26:13.238
Does she kill horses?

26:13.613 --> 26:16.658
-No, she doesn't, Judge.
-Then what's your point?

26:16.741 --> 26:21.162
My point is,
despite our proclaimed love of animals,

26:22.289 --> 26:25.584
they really exist
for our amusement, our pleasure,

26:25.667 --> 26:28.545
whether it be the caged ones in zoos,

26:28.628 --> 26:30.547
the cooked ones on our plate,

26:30.630 --> 26:33.925
the ones we make sick
so we don't have to be.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.012
Miss Horowitz thinks that we should draw
the line somewhere.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.848
I agree, but at vanity?

26:40.432 --> 26:42.183
This is America the beautiful,

26:42.267 --> 26:44.936
land of the breast, cheek
and hair implants,

26:45.020 --> 26:48.189
where we surgically suck fat
from our guts,

26:48.273 --> 26:49.816
cut open our faces and stretch them

26:49.899 --> 26:53.445
halfway up to our crowns,
inject our lips with collagen.

26:53.528 --> 26:57.240
During the holidays,
we give gift certificates for laser peels.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.617
I can see you've had yours.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.578
And makeup... (laughs)

27:01.661 --> 27:03.747
Dear God in heaven,
makeup is how we pull it off.

27:04.080 --> 27:07.042
Without it, my client would look
like Jerry Lewis.

27:07.125 --> 27:10.462
I still don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

27:12.297 --> 27:16.551
I'm simply saying that we, as a people,

27:17.052 --> 27:19.262
as a nation, like to feel pretty.

27:20.096 --> 27:21.348
SHIRLEY: It's who we are.

27:22.015 --> 27:25.644
And if it means a few young rabbits
have to sacrifice their lives,

27:25.727 --> 27:27.896
well, they and their families
can take heart,

27:27.979 --> 27:29.689
because they did so for their country.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.318
Because when you think about it,

27:33.818 --> 27:38.365
all we can really hope for
at this point is to save face.

27:53.713 --> 27:54.923
Did that help?

27:56.091 --> 27:57.092
(elevator bell dings)

28:00.470 --> 28:03.098
-She tanked it on purpose.
-I did not tank it.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.225
That speech was against me.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.936
Why didn't you tell me
she was a communist?

28:08.019 --> 28:09.187
I thought you knew.

28:09.562 --> 28:11.981
Alan, coming to the party tonight?

28:12.065 --> 28:15.568
You know how I relish the chance
to try out a new frock.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.821
There's a rumor you'll be in mine.

28:17.904 --> 28:21.074
Hmm, I would love that. Size 8?

28:21.866 --> 28:24.577
Alan, you will not dress up as me tonight.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.831
Shirley, we've been instructed
to choose somebody we admire.

28:27.914 --> 28:30.583
That leaves you and Dog the Bounty Hunter.

28:30.917 --> 28:33.253
You will not dress up as me.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.881
Alan, you've got to help me dump Bella.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.008
I'm not good when it comes
to breaking up with women.

28:39.092 --> 28:41.428
-I'm too soft.
-Denny, you shoot people.

28:41.511 --> 28:45.223
I thought of that, but it
would be illegal, except in Florida.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.226
You're going to have to dump her yourself.
I'm sorry.

28:48.309 --> 28:51.312
Alan, at least help me win back Bethany.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.774

29:01.865 --> 29:03.408
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.327
I just really needed to know.

29:07.787 --> 29:08.621
Why?

29:10.248 --> 29:11.082
Because...

29:13.126 --> 29:14.711
Of all people, why him?

29:17.881 --> 29:20.175
Actually, he's a pretty decent guy, Brad.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.723
Denise, I don't think I'm modern enough

29:26.806 --> 29:29.976
to handle this
"friends with benefits" thing.

29:31.269 --> 29:34.606
So I think I'm just going to
have to beg out of this arrangement.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.194
Okay?

29:41.446 --> 29:42.447
Okay.

30:06.095 --> 30:08.556
First of all, I will say for the record,

30:08.973 --> 30:13.019
I don't believe
in all that moisturizer, Botox,

30:13.102 --> 30:14.562

30:14.646 --> 30:17.398
Oh, please, Judge. How else could you look
like you do at 100?

30:18.566 --> 30:22.237
Uh, I am ordering Mr. Steinkellner

30:22.320 --> 30:26.825
and his coalition to stay
at least 100 feet away

30:26.908 --> 30:30.119
from Ms. Horowitz, the regular-sized one.

30:30.578 --> 30:33.623
As for protesting
at her place of business,

30:33.706 --> 30:36.751
if it's a public area, he may do so.

30:36.835 --> 30:40.380
-Yes!
-This is still a moderately free country.

30:40.463 --> 30:41.422
Adjourned.

30:44.592 --> 30:45.718
I am not happy.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.388
Well, they won't be able
to paint you blue, Bella.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.728
(stutters) Uh, I've got something to say.

30:57.689 --> 30:58.690
What's going on?

30:58.773 --> 31:01.693
Uh, uh, you once said that

31:01.776 --> 31:05.822
if it wasn't over for Bethany and me,
you wouldn't, uh, want...

31:08.658 --> 31:10.618
Bethany isn't over for me,

31:11.494 --> 31:12.370
not in my heart.

31:15.039 --> 31:17.876
Denny, she... she hates your guts.

31:17.959 --> 31:21.170
Yeah, but the thing is,

31:21.254 --> 31:23.256
I don't... I don't hate hers.

31:26.092 --> 31:27.218
Oh.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.347
Well...

31:32.348 --> 31:33.850
If, uh,

31:34.392 --> 31:37.145
my daughter's in your heart,

31:37.228 --> 31:40.064
it's, uh, not a mother's place to...

31:42.317 --> 31:44.903
Oh, I'm sorry, Bella.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.573
I know you won't believe this, but...

31:50.575 --> 31:53.661
I actually do place her happiness
above my own.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.083
I wish you both the best.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.303
Please don't hurt her, Denny.

32:21.230 --> 32:22.523
I didn't have to shoot her.

32:29.864 --> 32:30.865
So you won?

32:32.575 --> 32:33.993
Still undefeated.

32:34.911 --> 32:35.787
And Bella?

32:36.621 --> 32:38.247
She took it like the man she is,

32:39.248 --> 32:42.502
but now comes the tough part.

32:43.586 --> 32:46.798
Denny, under what pretext
is Bethany coming in?

32:46.881 --> 32:50.218
Oh, I told her I had a settlement offer
in lieu of an appeal.

32:50.843 --> 32:54.389
I really think you're capable
of handling this yourself.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.891
-Mm.
-Just speak from your heart.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.394
It's just that it's been
so long since I've done that.

33:03.481 --> 33:04.691
What's the offer?

33:08.528 --> 33:09.362
Bethany...

33:11.990 --> 33:14.742
This is not so much
about settling the case

33:15.952 --> 33:18.496
as it is settling you and me.

33:19.038 --> 33:21.541
-What are you talking about?
-I dumped your mother.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.626
You dumped Bella?

33:24.419 --> 33:25.837
'Cause I can't get over you.

33:27.588 --> 33:30.717
-(sighs) Too little, too late.
-Bethany...

33:33.553 --> 33:34.554
(groans)

33:35.513 --> 33:37.056
We all make mistakes.

33:37.140 --> 33:40.226
Too often, people are judged
by those mistakes.

33:40.852 --> 33:44.856
I think the true measure of a man lies...

33:51.195 --> 33:55.366
"...lies in his willingness
to right his wrongs."

34:02.999 --> 34:04.292
"I love you, Bethany."

34:06.711 --> 34:10.506
So will you join me in a party tonight?

34:10.590 --> 34:12.717
Costumes. You'll have fun.

34:13.676 --> 34:15.053
And you can pretend

34:15.845 --> 34:17.930

You're not getting in this outfit.

40:01.607 --> 40:04.151
We could go for a quiet drink somewhere.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.071
We're having a quiet drink right here.

40:11.117 --> 40:12.284
(chuckles)

40:12.701 --> 40:16.038
I'm driving you absolutely crazy,
aren't I?

40:20.709 --> 40:23.546
-(chuckles)
-If you had any idea how you look...

40:28.134 --> 40:29.844
Shirley was the one, Alan.

40:31.011 --> 40:34.640
One night, while making love,
she recited Proust to me.

40:35.641 --> 40:37.393
-Did you understand it?
-Not a word.

40:37.476 --> 40:39.520
-(laughs)
-I thought she was possessed.

40:40.646 --> 40:42.314
BRAD (speaking distantly):
You're not Buzz! I'm Buzz!

40:42.398 --> 40:44.316
-(Jeffrey yells indistinctly)
-Look at those two.

40:44.400 --> 40:49.196
-JEFFREY: I'm Buzz Lightyear!
-BRAD: I'm Buzz!

40:49.697 --> 40:52.032
Love us or hate us,
there's no other place like us.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.284
Here's to that.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.246
Forget it.

41:00.666 --> 41:01.792
Just one dance.

41:03.252 --> 41:05.379
Let me waltz down memory lane.

41:08.924 --> 41:10.426
One dance if you'll drop it.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.178
Fine.

41:15.514 --> 41:17.349
And you better respect me.

41:20.102 --> 41:21.270
Heh.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.608
("As Time Goes By" playing)

41:30.321 --> 41:33.449
(laughs)
Do I really remind you of Shirley?

41:34.241 --> 41:36.994
<i>♪ A kiss is still a kiss... ♪</i>

41:37.077 --> 41:38.662
Except some of the lumps
are in the wrong place.

41:38.746 --> 41:40.956
The lump you refer to is your own.

41:43.209 --> 41:47.505
<i>♪ The fundamental things apply ♪</i>

41:49.173 --> 41:50.382
<i>♪ As time... ♪</i>

41:52.176 --> 41:53.302
Imagine people looking out their window

41:53.385 --> 41:55.971
seeing Dick Cheney and Shirley Schmidt

41:56.055 --> 41:57.431
dancing on the balcony.

41:58.807 --> 42:00.392
What must they be thinking?

42:01.185 --> 42:02.770
Well, if they're regular viewers,

42:02.853 --> 42:04.688
they know by now, anything goes.

42:07.024 --> 42:07.858
Yes, it does.

42:07.942 --> 42:12.321

<i>Welcome lovers ♪</i>

42:13.906 --> 42:15.324

42:19.370 --> 42:21.789
-JEFFREY: Is that a rental?
-BRAD: Shut up! I had it first!

42:21.872 --> 42:22.998
You look like an idiot.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.126
JEFFREY: Take it off.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.506
NARRATOR:<i> Next on </i>Boston Legal...

42:30.589 --> 42:33.551
-I need to see Denny Crane, please.
-Why?

42:33.634 --> 42:34.677
Eighteen months ago,

42:34.760 --> 42:37.596
I was diagnosed
with Same-Sex Attraction Disorder.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.598
That would mean you're attracted to men.

42:39.682 --> 42:41.559
Oh, I'm not, of course.

42:41.642 --> 42:44.103
It's just that I think I am.

42:44.186 --> 42:46.855
I'm pregnant, one of you is the father,

42:46.939 --> 42:51.026
and I would like to know
who the paternal parent is.

42:51.443 --> 42:52.611
ALAN: Alan Shore for the plaintiff.

42:52.695 --> 42:55.823
Could I perhaps get
an ex parte sidebar, Judge?

42:55.906 --> 42:59.285
-I'll hold you in contempt right now.
-My handcuffs or yours?

43:00.869 --> 43:02.871
