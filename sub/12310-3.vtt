00:01.210 --> 00:04.150
God save King Edward, fourth of that name!

00:04.200 --> 00:07.650
Once more we sit in
England's royal throne,

00:07.700 --> 00:10.850
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.

00:10.900 --> 00:14.900
Hail the House of York.

00:19.900 --> 00:22.900
Brother Richard, will you stand by us?

00:25.900 --> 00:28.850
My liege, it is the Earl of Richmond.

00:28.900 --> 00:30.850
He is the House of Lancaster.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.850
I am the Queen!

00:32.900 --> 00:35.900
- Where's Richard gone?
- To make a bloody supper in the Tower!

01:31.900 --> 01:36.850
Now is the winter of our
discontent Made glorious summer

01:36.900 --> 01:40.850
by this sun of York;

01:40.900 --> 01:43.850
And all the clouds that
lour'd upon our house

01:43.900 --> 01:47.900
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.900
Grim-visaged war hath
smooth'd his wrinkled front;

01:55.900 --> 02:00.850
And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds

02:00.900 --> 02:05.850
To fright the souls of
fearful adversaries,

02:05.900 --> 02:08.850
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber

02:08.900 --> 02:11.900
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.

02:26.900 --> 02:32.900
But I, that am not shaped
for sportive tricks,

02:34.900 --> 02:37.900
Nor made to court an
amorous looking-glass;

02:39.900 --> 02:43.900
I, that am rudely stamp'd,
and want love's majesty

02:45.900 --> 02:51.850
I, that am curtail'd
of this fair proportion,

02:51.900 --> 02:56.850
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,

02:56.900 --> 03:00.850
Deformed, unfinish'd,

03:00.900 --> 03:04.850
sent before my time Into this
breathing world, scarce half made up,

03:04.900 --> 03:08.850
And that so lamely and
unfashionable That dogs bark at me

03:08.900 --> 03:10.900
as I halt by them!

03:18.900 --> 03:24.850
Why, I, in this weak and
piping time of peace,

03:24.900 --> 03:29.900
Have no delight to pass away the time

03:32.900 --> 03:37.850
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on my own deformity:

03:40.900 --> 03:43.850
And therefore, since I
cannot prove a lover,

03:43.900 --> 03:46.900
To entertain these fair well-spoken days

03:48.900 --> 03:53.850
I am determined to prove a villain

03:53.900 --> 03:58.900
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.

04:00.900 --> 04:04.900
'Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,

04:07.900 --> 04:09.850
'To set the King, my brother and Clarence

04:09.900 --> 04:12.850
'In deadly hate the one against the other'

04:12.900 --> 04:15.850
And if King Edward be as true and just

04:15.900 --> 04:18.899
As I am subtle, false and treacherous

04:20.899 --> 04:23.900
Then this day should
Clarence closely be mew'd up,

04:26.900 --> 04:28.850
About a prophecy, which says that "G"

04:28.900 --> 04:33.850
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.

04:33.900 --> 04:37.900
Dive, thoughts, down to my
soul: here Clarence comes.

04:39.900 --> 04:45.850
Brother, what means this armed
guard That waits upon your grace?

04:45.900 --> 04:50.850
His Majesty Tendering my person's safety,

04:50.900 --> 04:53.850
hath appointed This conduct
to convey me to the Tower

04:53.900 --> 04:57.850
- Upon what cause?
- Because my name is George.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.850
Alack, my lord, that
fault is none of yours;

05:00.900 --> 05:02.850
He should, for this,
commit your godfathers.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.850
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;

05:05.900 --> 05:09.850
And says a wizard told him that by G

05:09.900 --> 05:12.850
His issue disinherited should be

05:12.900 --> 05:14.850
And, for my name of George begins with G,

05:14.900 --> 05:18.850
It follows in his thoughts that I am he.

05:18.900 --> 05:21.850
This it is when men are ruled by women.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.850
'Tis not the King that
sends you to the Tower,

05:23.900 --> 05:27.900
Elizabeth, his wife, 'tis she
That tempers him to this extremity.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.850
We are not safe, Clarence,

05:32.900 --> 05:33.850
we are not safe.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.850
I beseech your graces both to pardon me.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.850
His Majesty has straightly given in charge

05:39.900 --> 05:41.850
That no man shall have private conference,

05:41.900 --> 05:44.850
Of what degree so ever, with his brother.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.850
We speak no treason, man.

05:46.900 --> 05:47.850
We say the King is...

05:47.900 --> 05:50.850
wise and virtuous,

05:50.900 --> 05:53.850
And his noble Queen well struck in years,

05:53.900 --> 05:55.850
fair, and not jealous.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.850
How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?

05:57.900 --> 06:00.850
I do beseech your grace
to pardon me and withal.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.850
Forbear your conference
with the noble Duke.

06:02.900 --> 06:06.600
We know thy charge,
Brakenbury, and will obey.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.900
Brother, farewell.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.850
I will unto the King.

06:11.900 --> 06:16.850
Meantime, this deep disgrace touches
me deeper than you can imagine.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.850
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

06:19.900 --> 06:23.900
Well, your imprisonment will not be long.

06:24.900 --> 06:27.040
Meantime, be patient.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.770
I must perforce.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.370
Farewell.

06:34.900 --> 06:38.850
Go, tread the path that
thou shalt ne'er return.

06:38.900 --> 06:41.900
Simple, plain Clarence!

06:43.900 --> 06:45.850
I do love thee so,

06:45.900 --> 06:49.900
that shortly I will send
thy soul... to Heaven.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.850
Good time of day to you,
Lord Chamberlain. What news?

07:07.900 --> 07:09.850
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,

07:09.900 --> 07:11.850
And his physicians fear him mightily.

07:11.900 --> 07:13.850
He broke the feast and
has returned to bed.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.850
Oh, he hath kept an evil diet long

07:16.900 --> 07:19.850
And overmuch consumed his royal person.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.850
- Where is he? In his bed?
- He is.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.850
Go you before, and I will follow you.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.850
He cannot live, I hope,

07:26.900 --> 07:31.850
and must not die till George be
packed with post-horse up to Heaven.

07:31.900 --> 07:35.850
I'll in to urge his hatred more And
if I fail not in my deep intent,

07:35.900 --> 07:38.900
Dear George hath not another day to live.

07:52.900 --> 07:56.850
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates.

07:56.900 --> 07:58.850
Are you now tomorrow
to dispatch this thing?

07:58.900 --> 07:59.850
We are, my lord.

07:59.900 --> 08:02.850
And we come to have the warrant
that we may be admitted where he is.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.850
Well thought upon, I
have it here about me.

08:05.900 --> 08:08.850
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.850
Do not hear him plead.

08:10.900 --> 08:12.850
My brother is well spoken,

08:12.900 --> 08:15.850
And perhaps may move your
hearts to pity if you mark him.

08:15.900 --> 08:18.850
Tut, tut, my lord, we
will not stand to prate.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.850
Talkers are no good doers,

08:20.900 --> 08:23.900
Be assured, we go to use our
hands and not our tongues.

08:24.900 --> 08:29.850
Your eyes drop millstones,
when fools' eyes drop tears.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.850
I like you, lads.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.850
About your business
straight. Go, go, dispatch.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.169
We will, my noble lord.

10:36.900 --> 10:39.900
Cursed be the hand that
made those fatal holes!

10:41.900 --> 10:44.900
Cursed be the heart that
had the heart to do it!

10:46.900 --> 10:49.900
More direful hap betide that hated wretch

10:50.900 --> 10:52.850
Than I can wish to adders,

10:52.900 --> 10:54.900
spiders, toads.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.850
If ever he have wife, let
her be made more miserable

10:59.900 --> 11:01.850
By the death of him

11:01.900 --> 11:03.850
than I by my husband

11:03.900 --> 11:06.500
And father-in-law, King Henry.

11:20.850 --> 11:21.850
What black magician
conjures up this fiend?

11:21.900 --> 11:26.850
What black magician
conjures up this fiend?

11:26.900 --> 11:28.370
Avaunt...

11:29.900 --> 11:32.850
.. thou dreadful minister of hell!

11:32.900 --> 11:34.850
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.

11:34.900 --> 11:37.850
Villain, thou know'st no law of God

11:37.900 --> 11:42.850
Nor man, no beast so fierce
But knows some touch of pity.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.850
But I know none, and
therefore am no beast.

11:45.900 --> 11:49.850
O, wonderful when devils tell the truth.

11:49.900 --> 11:52.900
More wonderful when angels are so angry.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.850
Fairer than tongue can name thee,

11:57.900 --> 12:00.850
Let me have some patient
leisure to excuse myself.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.850
I shall not grant excuses

12:03.900 --> 12:08.850
To the thing that killed
my husband, my father

12:08.900 --> 12:10.900
and my King.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.850
Dead.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.850
Dead, they are, and,
devilish slave, by thee.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.850
I did not kill your husband.

12:19.900 --> 12:20.850
Why, then, is he alive?

12:20.900 --> 12:23.900
Nay, he is dead, and
by King Edward's hand.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.850
In thy foul throat thou liest.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.850
Queen Margaret saw thy murderous dagger

12:29.900 --> 12:31.850
smoking in his blood.

12:31.900 --> 12:34.440
Didst thou not kill the King?

12:35.900 --> 12:37.900
I grant ye, yea.

12:39.900 --> 12:42.850
Dost grant me, hedgehog?

12:42.900 --> 12:44.850
He was

12:44.900 --> 12:46.850
gentle,

12:46.900 --> 12:48.850
mild

12:48.900 --> 12:51.850
- and virtuous. - Better for the
King of Heaven that hath him.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.850
He is in heaven, where
thou shalt never come.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.850
He was fitter for that place than earth.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.850
And thou unfit for any place but hell.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.850
Yes, one place else, if
you will hear me name it.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.770
- Some dungeon?
- Your bedchamber.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.850
Is not the causer of these timeless deaths

13:08.900 --> 13:11.850
As blameful as the executioner?

13:11.900 --> 13:16.850
Thou was the cause and
most accursed effect.

13:16.900 --> 13:19.900
Your beauty was the cause of that effect.

13:20.900 --> 13:24.850
Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleep

13:24.900 --> 13:27.850
To undertake the death of all the world,

13:27.900 --> 13:30.850
So I might live one hour

13:30.900 --> 13:32.970
in your sweet bosom.

13:34.900 --> 13:39.850
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,

13:39.900 --> 13:42.850
These nails should rend
that beauty from my cheeks.

13:42.900 --> 13:45.850
These eyes could not
endure sweet beauty's wreck.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.850
You should not blemish it, if I stood by.

13:47.900 --> 13:51.850
It is a quarrel most unnatural to
be revenged on him that loveth thee.

13:51.900 --> 13:54.850
It is a quarrel just and reasonable

13:54.900 --> 13:56.850
To be revenged on him
that killed my husband.

13:56.900 --> 13:59.850
He that bereft thee of thy husband, lady,

13:59.900 --> 14:01.850
Did it to help thee to a better husband.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.850
Better dost not breathe upon the earth.

14:03.900 --> 14:06.850
- He lives that loves thee better
than he could. - Where is he?

14:06.900 --> 14:08.170
Here.

14:14.900 --> 14:16.850
Why dost thou spit on me?

14:16.900 --> 14:18.850
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.850
Never came poison from so sweet a place.

14:20.900 --> 14:23.850
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.

14:23.900 --> 14:24.850
Out of my sight!

14:24.900 --> 14:27.850
Oh, thou dost infect my eyes.

14:27.900 --> 14:31.850
Thine eyes, sweet lady,
have infected mine.

14:31.900 --> 14:34.850
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,

14:34.900 --> 14:36.850
Teach not thy mouth such scorn,

14:36.900 --> 14:39.900
For it was made for kissing,
lady, not for such contempt.

14:43.900 --> 14:45.850
Lo, here,

14:45.900 --> 14:48.840
I lend thee this sharp-pointed blade

14:51.900 --> 14:55.850
Which if thou choose to
hide in this true breast

14:55.900 --> 14:58.850
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee

14:58.900 --> 15:03.900
I lay it naked until the deadly stroke.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.850
Nay, do not pause...

15:20.900 --> 15:23.850
.. for I did kill King Henry.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.850
Nay, now dispatch.

15:25.900 --> 15:28.900
'Twas I that stabbed your husband.

15:45.900 --> 15:48.850
Take up the knife again or take up me.

15:48.900 --> 15:49.850
Arise, dissembler.

15:49.900 --> 15:52.170
Though I wish thy death

15:53.900 --> 15:56.500
I will not be thy executioner.

15:56.900 --> 15:59.900
Then bid me kill myself and I will do it.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.500
Well, well, put up your blade.

16:04.900 --> 16:06.850
Then say my peace is made.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.500
That shall you know hereafter.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.850
But shall I live in hope?

16:11.900 --> 16:14.900
All men, I hope, live so.

16:16.900 --> 16:19.900
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.170
To take is not to give.

16:34.900 --> 16:37.900
Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.900
Even so thy breast
encloseth my poor heart.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.850
And if thy poor devoted
servant may But beg one favour

16:47.900 --> 16:49.850
at thy gracious hand,

16:49.900 --> 16:52.900
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.

16:56.900 --> 17:00.850
That it may please you,
presently repair to Westminster.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.900
I will with all expedient
duty see you there.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.970
I beseech you, come.

17:09.900 --> 17:11.900
Bid me farewell.

17:23.900 --> 17:27.900
Much it joys me to see you
are become so penitent.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.900
Was ever woman in this humour wooed?

17:41.900 --> 17:44.900
Was ever woman in this humour won?

17:46.900 --> 17:50.200
I'll have her, but I'll not keep her long.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.850
What!

17:54.900 --> 17:57.850
I, that killed her husband and her father,

17:57.900 --> 18:00.850
To take her in her extremest hate,

18:00.900 --> 18:03.900
Curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,

18:05.900 --> 18:08.850
And yet to win her, all
the world to nothing!

18:08.900 --> 18:10.040
Ha!

18:12.900 --> 18:15.850
And will she yet debase
her eyes to look on me?

18:15.900 --> 18:19.900
On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?

18:21.900 --> 18:24.900
I do mistake my person all this while.

18:26.850 --> 18:27.850
Upon my life,

18:27.900 --> 18:29.850
she finds, although I cannot,

18:29.900 --> 18:32.900
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.850
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,

18:35.900 --> 18:37.850
And entertain a score or two of tailors

18:37.900 --> 18:40.900
To study fashions to adorn my body.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.850
Since I have crept in favour with myself,

18:49.900 --> 18:52.900
I will maintain it at some little cost.

18:53.850 --> 18:54.850
Shine out, fair sun,

18:54.900 --> 18:56.850
till I have bought a glass,

18:56.900 --> 18:59.900
That I may see my shadow as I pass.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.850
Have patience, sister.

19:39.900 --> 19:42.850
There's no doubt His Majesty will
soon recover his accustomed term.

19:42.900 --> 19:45.850
If he were dead, what would
betide on me, brother?

19:45.900 --> 19:47.850
No other harm but loss of such a lord.

19:47.900 --> 19:50.850
The loss of such a lord
includes all harms.

19:50.900 --> 19:53.850
The heavens have blessed you
with a goodly son, Mother,

19:53.900 --> 19:54.850
To be your comforter when he has gone.

19:54.900 --> 19:56.850
Ah, he is young and his minority

19:56.900 --> 19:58.850
Is put unto the trust
of Richard Gloucester,

19:58.900 --> 20:01.850
A man that loves not me nor none of you.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.850
Is it concluded that
he shall be protector?

20:04.900 --> 20:06.850
So it must be,

20:06.900 --> 20:08.850
if the King miscarry.

20:08.900 --> 20:11.850
Here come the lords of
Buckingham and Stanley.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.850
Good time of day unto your royal grace.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.850
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?

20:16.900 --> 20:18.850
Madam, good hope. His
grace speaks cheerfully.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.850
- Did you confer with him?
- Aye, madam.

20:20.900 --> 20:23.850
He desires to make atonement
between the Duke of Gloucester

20:23.900 --> 20:25.850
And your brother and son,

20:25.900 --> 20:27.850
and between them and my Lord Hastings.

20:27.900 --> 20:31.850
He has sent to bring them
to his royal presence.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.850
Would all were well.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.850
But that will never be.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.850
They do me wrong and I will not accept it.

20:37.900 --> 20:39.850
Who are they that do
complain unto the King

20:39.900 --> 20:43.850
That I, forsooth, am
stern and love them not?

20:43.900 --> 20:46.850
Oh, by holy Paul, they love his grace

20:46.900 --> 20:52.850
But lightly that fill his ears
With such dissentious rumours.

20:52.900 --> 20:55.850
Because I cannot flatter or look fair,

20:55.900 --> 20:57.850
Smile in men's faces,

20:57.900 --> 21:00.850
smooth, deceive and cog,

21:00.900 --> 21:02.850
I must be held a rancorous enemy.

21:02.900 --> 21:04.850
To whom in all this
presence speaks your grace?

21:04.900 --> 21:08.850
To thee, that hast not
honesty nor grace, Lord Grey.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.850
When have I injured thee?
When done thee wrong?

21:10.900 --> 21:13.850
Or thee, Lord Rivers? Or thee, Elizabeth?

21:13.900 --> 21:15.850
Or any of your faction?

21:15.900 --> 21:17.850
A plague upon you all.

21:17.900 --> 21:21.850
His royal grace cannot rest
scarce a breathing-while

21:21.900 --> 21:24.850
But you must trouble him
with lewd complaints.

21:24.900 --> 21:25.850
Come, come.

21:25.900 --> 21:28.850
We know your meaning, brother Gloucester.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.850
You envy my advancement and my friends'.

21:30.900 --> 21:32.850
God grant we never may have need of you.

21:32.900 --> 21:36.850
Meantime, God grants
that we have need of you.

21:36.900 --> 21:39.850
Our brother George,
imprisoned by your means,

21:39.900 --> 21:43.850
Myself disgraced, and the
nobility held in contempt.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.850
I never did incense His Majesty
against the Duke of Clarence,

21:45.900 --> 21:48.850
But have been an earnest
advocate to plead for him.

21:48.900 --> 21:52.850
You do me shameful injury falsely
to draw me in such vile suspects.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.850
By heaven, I will acquaint His
Majesty of those gross taunts

21:55.900 --> 21:57.850
Which oft I have endured.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.850
Tell him, and spare not.

21:59.900 --> 22:01.850
Lord, I have said I will
avouch it in Edward's presence.

22:01.900 --> 22:04.850
Ere you were Queen, aye,
or your husband King,

22:04.900 --> 22:07.850
I was the packhorse in his great affairs.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.850
To royalise his blood, I spilt mine own!

22:10.900 --> 22:14.850
I would to God my heart
were flint, like Edward's.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.850
I'm too childish-foolish for this world.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.900
Hear me, you wrangling pirates,

22:21.900 --> 22:26.900
That fall out in sharing that
which you have pilled from me!

22:27.900 --> 22:30.240
Which of you trembles not

22:31.900 --> 22:33.850
that looks on me?

22:33.900 --> 22:36.850
O gentle villain,

22:36.900 --> 22:38.900
do not turn away.

22:43.900 --> 22:46.900
Foul, wrinkled witch,

22:47.900 --> 22:49.850
what makest thou in my sight?

22:49.900 --> 22:52.850
A husband and a son

22:52.900 --> 22:54.900
thou owest to me.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.850
And thou a kingdom.

22:58.900 --> 23:02.850
All of you allegiance.

23:02.900 --> 23:07.850
This sorrow I have by right is yours,

23:07.900 --> 23:10.900
And all the pleasures you usurp

23:13.900 --> 23:15.370
are mine!

23:17.900 --> 23:21.850
Give way, dull clouds,

23:21.900 --> 23:23.900
to my quick curses!

23:26.900 --> 23:29.850
Edward thy son, that
now is Prince of Wales,

23:29.900 --> 23:32.850
For Edward my son, that
was Prince of Wales,

23:32.900 --> 23:35.900
Die in his youth by untimely violence.

23:38.900 --> 23:41.850
Long die thy happy days before thy death.

23:41.900 --> 23:44.850
Cease thy curses, thou
wretched, withered hag!

23:44.900 --> 23:47.850
And leave thee out? For
thou shalt hear me.

23:47.900 --> 23:51.850
If heaven have any
grievous plague in store,

23:51.900 --> 23:53.850
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,

23:53.900 --> 23:57.850
And then hurl down their
indignation on thee,

23:57.900 --> 23:59.850
The troubler of the poor world's peace.

23:59.900 --> 24:02.850
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine

24:02.900 --> 24:06.850
Unless whilst some tormenting
dream affrights thee

24:06.900 --> 24:09.850
With a hell of ugly devils!

24:09.900 --> 24:13.850
Thou elvish-marked, abortive, rooting hog!

24:13.900 --> 24:16.850
The slave of nature and the son of hell.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.850
Margaret!

24:18.900 --> 24:19.850
Margaret.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.850
Thus have you breathed your curse

24:21.900 --> 24:23.900
against yourself.

24:24.900 --> 24:27.850
Poor painted Queen,

24:27.900 --> 24:31.850
vain flourish of my fortune!

24:31.900 --> 24:33.850
Why strewest thou sugar
on that bottled spider

24:33.900 --> 24:36.850
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?

24:36.900 --> 24:38.850
Fool!

24:38.900 --> 24:41.850
Thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.

24:41.900 --> 24:44.850
The day will come when
thou shalt wish for me

24:44.900 --> 24:48.850
To help thee curse that
poisonous bunchbacked toad.

24:48.900 --> 24:50.850
Dispute not with her, she is lunatic.

24:50.900 --> 24:53.850
Witness my son,

24:53.900 --> 24:55.850
now in the shade of death,

24:55.900 --> 24:58.850
Whose bright out-shining beams

24:58.900 --> 25:03.850
thy cloudy wrath Hath in
eternal darkness folded up.

25:03.900 --> 25:05.900
Peace.

25:07.850 --> 25:08.850
For shame

25:08.900 --> 25:10.900
if not for charity.

25:11.900 --> 25:14.850
O, Buckingham,

25:14.900 --> 25:17.850
take heed of yonder dog.

25:17.900 --> 25:19.850
Look, when he fawns, he bites,

25:19.900 --> 25:23.850
And, when he bites, his venom
tooth will rankle to the death.

25:23.900 --> 25:25.850
Have not to do with him.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.900
Beware of him.

25:30.900 --> 25:34.100
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

25:40.900 --> 25:43.900
- Nothing that I respect,
my gracious lord. - Mm.

25:47.900 --> 25:49.170
What?

25:49.900 --> 25:55.850
Dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?

25:55.900 --> 25:58.900
And soothe the devil
that I warn thee from?

25:59.900 --> 26:01.850
O,

26:01.900 --> 26:04.850
but remember this another day,

26:04.900 --> 26:08.850
When he shall split thy
very heart with sorrow

26:08.900 --> 26:11.900
And say, "Poor Margaret

26:13.900 --> 26:15.900
"was a prophetess."

26:20.900 --> 26:22.900
Live each of you

26:23.900 --> 26:26.850
the subjects to his hate,

26:26.900 --> 26:28.900
And he to yours

26:30.900 --> 26:32.850
and all of you

26:32.900 --> 26:34.370
to God's.

27:04.900 --> 27:07.850
My hair doth stand on
end to hear her curses.

27:07.900 --> 27:09.850
And so doth mine.

27:09.900 --> 27:11.850
I muse why she's at liberty.

27:11.900 --> 27:14.900
She hath had too much wrong

27:15.900 --> 27:19.900
And I do repent my part thereof
that I have done to her.

27:21.850 --> 27:22.850
I never did her any,

27:22.900 --> 27:24.770
to my knowledge.

27:25.900 --> 27:29.200
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.850
Madam, His Majesty doth call for you.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.850
And for you, my grace. And
you, my gracious lords.

27:34.900 --> 27:36.850
I come.

27:36.900 --> 27:37.850
Lords, will you go with me?

27:37.900 --> 27:40.170
We wait upon your grace.

27:42.900 --> 27:44.850
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach

27:44.900 --> 27:47.850
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.850
And Clarence, whom I, indeed,
have laid in darkness,

27:50.900 --> 27:52.850
I do beweep to many simple gulls,

27:52.900 --> 27:55.850
Namely to Stanley, Hastings, Buckingham,

27:55.900 --> 27:57.850
And tell them 'tis the
Queen and her allies

27:57.900 --> 28:01.900
That stir the King against
the Duke, my brother.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.850
Now, they believe it,

28:05.900 --> 28:09.900
and withal whet me to be
revenged on Rivers and on Grey.

28:20.850 --> 28:21.850
But then I sigh,

28:21.900 --> 28:22.850
and, with a piece of scripture,

28:22.900 --> 28:25.900
Tell them that God bids
us do good for evil.

28:26.900 --> 28:29.850
And thus I clothe my naked villainy

28:29.900 --> 28:33.850
With old odd ends stolen
forth of holy writ

28:33.900 --> 28:35.900
And seem a saint

28:36.900 --> 28:39.370
when most I play the devil.

28:56.900 --> 28:59.900
Why looks your grace so heavily today?

29:01.900 --> 29:04.700
O, I've passed a miserable night.

29:05.900 --> 29:09.850
So full of fearful dreams, ugly sights

29:09.900 --> 29:13.850
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,

29:13.900 --> 29:15.850
I would not spend another such a night,

29:15.900 --> 29:17.850
Though 'twere to buy a
world of happy days.

29:17.900 --> 29:20.440
What was your dream, my lord?

29:22.900 --> 29:24.900
I passed methought

29:25.900 --> 29:27.970
the melancholy flood

29:28.900 --> 29:31.850
With that sour ferryman poets write of

29:31.900 --> 29:34.900
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.850
The first

29:40.900 --> 29:42.850
that there did greet my stranger soul,

29:42.900 --> 29:44.970
Shadow like an angel

29:45.900 --> 29:47.850
with bright hair

29:47.900 --> 29:49.840
dabbled in blood.

29:50.900 --> 29:53.240
And he shrieked out aloud

29:54.900 --> 29:56.900
"Clarence is come

29:59.900 --> 30:02.900
"That stabbed me in the
woods by Tewkesbury.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.850
"Seize on him, Furies,

30:06.900 --> 30:09.370
"take him to your torment."

30:12.900 --> 30:14.850
With that,

30:14.900 --> 30:18.900
methought, a legion of
foul fiends environed me

30:19.900 --> 30:22.440
And houled in mine ears such

30:22.850 --> 30:23.850
hideous cries

30:23.900 --> 30:28.850
That with the very noise
I trembling waked,

30:28.900 --> 30:31.100
And for a season after

30:32.900 --> 30:34.840
could not believe

30:35.900 --> 30:37.850
but that I was in hell.

30:37.900 --> 30:41.850
No marvel, my lord,
though it affrighted you.

30:41.900 --> 30:44.900
- I am afraid, methinks, to
hear you tell it. - Keeper...

30:45.900 --> 30:48.850
Keeper, I have done these things,

30:48.900 --> 30:51.900
But now give evidence against
my soul, for Edward's sake

30:53.900 --> 30:56.370
And see how he requites me.

30:56.900 --> 30:59.900
Keeper, prithy sit by me awhile.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.850
My soul is heavy,

31:03.900 --> 31:06.170
and I fain would sleep.

31:09.900 --> 31:11.900
I will, my lord.

31:14.900 --> 31:17.500
God give your grace good rest.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.850
What words, thou fellows?

31:33.900 --> 31:34.850
How camest thou hither?

31:34.900 --> 31:36.850
We would speak to Prince George,

31:36.900 --> 31:37.850
and I came hither on my legs.

31:37.900 --> 31:40.850
What? So brief?

31:40.900 --> 31:43.900
'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious.

31:44.900 --> 31:46.900
See our commission.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.770
We talk no more.

31:57.900 --> 32:00.850
In God's name, who sent you hither?

32:00.900 --> 32:02.850
Wherefore come you?

32:02.900 --> 32:04.570
To murder me?

32:05.900 --> 32:09.850
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?

32:09.900 --> 32:11.850
Offended us you have not,

32:11.900 --> 32:13.850
but the King.

32:13.900 --> 32:15.850
I am his brother,

32:15.900 --> 32:16.850
and I love him well.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.240
If you be hired for money

32:20.900 --> 32:22.850
back again,

32:22.900 --> 32:24.850
And I will send you to
my brother Gloucester

32:24.900 --> 32:26.850
And he will reward you better for my life

32:26.900 --> 32:29.850
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.

32:29.900 --> 32:31.840
You are deceived,

32:31.900 --> 32:34.850
your brother Gloucester hates you.

32:34.900 --> 32:37.900
Make peace with God, for
you must die, my lord.

32:39.900 --> 32:44.000
- My friend, I spy some
pity in thy looks. - Enough!

32:55.900 --> 32:57.850
If all this will not do,

32:57.900 --> 33:00.440
I'll drown you in the bucket.

33:01.900 --> 33:03.040
No!

33:04.900 --> 33:06.040
No!

33:06.900 --> 33:08.850
Calm down!

33:44.900 --> 33:49.900
Why, so, now have I
done a good day's work.

33:50.900 --> 33:53.850
You peers, continue this united league.

33:53.900 --> 33:56.900
Rivers and Hastings

33:59.900 --> 34:01.850
dissemble not your hatred,

34:01.900 --> 34:03.770
swear your love.

34:07.900 --> 34:12.850
By heaven, my soul is
purged from grudging hate,

34:12.900 --> 34:15.900
And with my hand I seal
my true heart's love.

34:18.900 --> 34:21.900
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like.

34:24.900 --> 34:27.900
Madam, yourself is not exempt from this.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.850
Nor you, stepson Grey.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.850
Buckingham, nor you.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.850
You have been factious
one against the other.

34:36.900 --> 34:40.850
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.

34:40.900 --> 34:43.040
So thrive I and mine.

34:47.900 --> 34:51.900
This interchange of
love shall be inviolable.

34:57.900 --> 35:00.900
And, in good time, here
comes the Duke of Gloucester.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.850
Good morrow to my
sovereign King and Queen.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.850
And, princely peers, a happy time of day.

35:08.900 --> 35:12.850
Happy, indeed, as we have spent
the day making peace of enmity,

35:12.900 --> 35:14.850
Fair love of hate,

35:14.900 --> 35:17.850
between these swelling
wrong-incensed peers.

35:17.900 --> 35:20.850
A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord.

35:20.900 --> 35:22.850
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,

35:22.900 --> 35:26.850
Have aught committed that is hardly
borne by any in this presence,

35:26.900 --> 35:31.900
I desire to reconcile me
to his friendly peace.

35:33.900 --> 35:35.850
There is no Englishman alive

35:35.900 --> 35:38.900
with whom my soul is any jot at odds.

35:41.900 --> 35:45.700
I would to God all strifes
were well compounded.

35:45.900 --> 35:48.850
My sovereign Lord, I
do beseech your highness

35:48.900 --> 35:51.850
To bring our brother
Clarence to your grace.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.850
Why, madam,

35:53.900 --> 35:56.440
have I offered love for this

35:56.900 --> 36:01.850
To be so flouted in this royal presence?

36:01.900 --> 36:05.300
Who knows not that the
gentle Duke is dead?

36:06.900 --> 36:09.850
You do him injury to scorn his corpse!

36:09.900 --> 36:11.850
- Who knows not he is dead!
- Who knows he is?

36:11.900 --> 36:14.850
All heaven, what a world is this!

36:14.900 --> 36:16.840
Is Clarence dead?

36:21.900 --> 36:23.850
The order was reversed.

36:23.900 --> 36:28.850
But he, poor man, by
your first order died,

36:28.900 --> 36:31.850
And that a winged Mercury did bear,

36:31.900 --> 36:34.850
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand

36:34.900 --> 36:37.770
And came too lag to see him buried.

36:38.900 --> 36:41.170
Who sued to me for him?

36:42.900 --> 36:47.850
Who, in my wrath, kneeled at
my feet And bade me be advised?

36:47.900 --> 36:50.850
Who spoke of brotherhood?

36:50.900 --> 36:52.900
Who spoke of love?

36:53.900 --> 36:56.850
All of this from my remembrance
brutish wrath sinfully plucked,

36:56.900 --> 36:59.850
And not a man of you had so
much grace to put it in my mind.

36:59.900 --> 37:04.850
Nor I, ungracious, spake unto
myself for him, poor soul.

37:04.900 --> 37:08.900
O God, I fear thy justice
will take hold on me

37:12.850 --> 37:13.850
And you

37:13.900 --> 37:16.850
and mine and yours

37:16.900 --> 37:18.370
for this.

37:22.900 --> 37:25.640
Elizabeth, help me to my closet.

37:29.900 --> 37:31.900
O, poor George!

37:41.900 --> 37:44.500
This is the fruit of rashness!

37:44.850 --> 37:45.850
Marked you not

37:45.900 --> 37:48.850
How that the guilty kindred of the Queen

37:48.900 --> 37:51.900
Looked pale when they did
hear of Clarence' death?

37:52.900 --> 37:55.900
O, they did urge it still unto the King.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.970
God will revenge it.

38:00.900 --> 38:02.850
Come, lords.

38:02.900 --> 38:05.170
We wait upon your grace.

38:58.900 --> 39:00.850
Who shall hinder me to wail and weep,

39:00.900 --> 39:03.900
To chide my fortune and torment myself?

39:05.900 --> 39:08.850
What means this scene of rude impatience?

39:08.900 --> 39:09.850
My lord,

39:09.900 --> 39:11.850
thy son,

39:11.900 --> 39:12.850
their father,

39:12.900 --> 39:14.850
our King,

39:14.900 --> 39:16.300
is dead.

39:16.900 --> 39:18.850
If you will live, lament,

39:18.900 --> 39:19.850
if die, be brief,

39:19.900 --> 39:22.850
That our swift-winged
souls may catch the King's,

39:22.900 --> 39:24.850
And, like obedient subjects, follow him

39:24.900 --> 39:28.850
To his new kingdom of
ne'er-changing night.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.040
Ah.

39:31.900 --> 39:34.900
So much interest have I in thy sorrow

39:35.900 --> 39:38.900
As I had title in thy noble husband.

39:40.900 --> 39:43.850
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,

39:43.900 --> 39:46.840
And lived with looking on his images

39:47.900 --> 39:50.850
But now two mirrors of
his princely semblance

39:50.900 --> 39:53.850
Are cracked in pieces by malignant death,

39:53.900 --> 39:57.850
And I for comfort have
but one false glass,

39:57.900 --> 40:01.400
Which grieves me when
I see my shame in him.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.850
Thou art a widow -- yet thou art a mother,

40:05.900 --> 40:08.850
Thou hast the comfort
of thy children left;

40:08.900 --> 40:13.850
But death hath snatch'd
my husband from my side

40:13.900 --> 40:16.850
And pluck'd two crutches
from my feeble hands:

40:16.900 --> 40:18.970
Clarence and Edward.

40:20.900 --> 40:23.850
Pour all your tears:

40:23.900 --> 40:25.850
I am your sorrow's nurse,

40:25.900 --> 40:28.900
And I will pamper it with lamentations.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.850
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,

40:32.900 --> 40:35.850
Of the young Prince your son:

40:35.900 --> 40:38.850
Send straight for him; Let him be crown'd;

40:38.900 --> 40:41.850
In him your comfort lives.

40:41.900 --> 40:45.850
Sister, sister, have comfort:

40:45.900 --> 40:46.850
All of us have cause

40:46.900 --> 40:49.850
To wail the dimming of our shining star,

40:49.900 --> 40:53.400
But none can help our
harms by wailing them.

40:54.900 --> 40:58.900
Madam, my mother, I do cry you
mercy: I did not see your grace.

40:59.900 --> 41:02.100
I crave your blessing.

41:06.900 --> 41:11.850
God bless thee, and put
meekness in thy breast;

41:11.900 --> 41:16.900
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty.

41:19.900 --> 41:21.900
Amen.

41:25.900 --> 41:29.850
You here that bear this
heavy load of moan,

41:29.900 --> 41:33.200
Now cheer each other in each other's love.

41:33.900 --> 41:35.850
Meseemeth good, that
with some little train,

41:35.900 --> 41:38.850
Forthwith from Ludlow the
young Prince be fetched

41:38.900 --> 41:40.850
Hither to London, to be crown'd our King.

41:40.900 --> 41:43.850
Why with some little train,
my Lord of Buckingham?

41:43.900 --> 41:45.850
Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude

41:45.900 --> 41:48.850
The new-heal'd wound of
malice should break out,

41:48.900 --> 41:50.850
Which would be so much the more dangerous

41:50.900 --> 41:52.850
By how much the estate is
green and yet ungovern'd.

41:52.900 --> 41:54.850
Then be it so, and go we to determine

41:54.900 --> 41:56.850
Who they shall be that
shall straight to Ludlow.

41:56.900 --> 41:59.850
Madam, and you, my sister, will you go

41:59.900 --> 42:01.850
To give your censures in this business?

42:01.900 --> 42:03.900
With all my heart.

42:11.900 --> 42:14.040
Cousin of Buckingham.

42:14.900 --> 42:18.850
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,

42:18.900 --> 42:21.850
For God's sake let not
us two stay at home:

42:21.900 --> 42:23.850
For by the way I'll sort occasion,

42:23.900 --> 42:27.850
To part the Queen's proud
kindred from the Prince.

42:27.900 --> 42:30.850
My other self,

42:30.900 --> 42:33.850
my counsel's consistory,

42:33.900 --> 42:38.900
My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin:

42:40.900 --> 42:44.850
As a child, I will follow your direction.

42:44.900 --> 42:47.900
Toward Ludlow then, for
we'll not leave behind.

43:53.900 --> 43:55.850
Prince Edward.

43:55.900 --> 43:57.570
Your Majesty.

44:06.900 --> 44:08.850
At Northampton they do rest tonight:

44:08.900 --> 44:11.850
Tomorrow, or next day, they will be here.

44:11.900 --> 44:13.850
I long with all my heart
to see Prince Edward;

44:13.900 --> 44:17.850
I hope he is much grown
since last I saw him.

44:17.900 --> 44:20.850
Ah, but I hear no: they
say his royal brother

44:20.900 --> 44:22.850
Has almost overta'en him in his growth.

44:22.900 --> 44:25.850
Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.

44:25.900 --> 44:28.850
Why, my good cousin? It is good to grow.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.850
Grandam, one night as
we did sit at supper,

44:31.900 --> 44:33.850
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow

44:33.900 --> 44:35.850
More than my brother.

44:35.900 --> 44:39.850
"Ay," quoth my uncle Richard,
"Small herbs have grace;

44:39.900 --> 44:42.850
"great weeds do grow apace."

44:42.900 --> 44:45.850
Good faith, good faith,
the saying did not hold

44:45.900 --> 44:48.850
In him that did object the same to thee!

44:48.900 --> 44:50.850
He was the wretched'st
thing when he was young,

44:50.900 --> 44:54.850
So long a-growing, and so leisurely,

44:54.900 --> 44:57.850
That if his rule were true,
he should be gracious.

44:57.900 --> 45:00.900
Parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.

45:04.850 --> 45:05.850
What news?

45:05.900 --> 45:08.850
Such news, madam, as grieves me to report.

45:08.900 --> 45:10.850
How doth the Prince?

45:10.900 --> 45:11.850
Oh, well, madam, and in health.

45:11.900 --> 45:13.850
Then what is thy news?

45:13.900 --> 45:16.850
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey Are
sent to Pomfret, prisoners.

45:16.900 --> 45:18.850
Who hath committed them?

45:18.900 --> 45:20.850
The mighty Dukes,
Gloucester and Buckingham.

45:20.900 --> 45:22.850
For what offence?

45:22.900 --> 45:24.850
The sum of all I can I have disclos'd.

45:24.900 --> 45:27.850
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,

45:27.900 --> 45:30.900
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!

45:35.900 --> 45:37.850
Farewell, daughter.

45:37.900 --> 45:41.850
Come, come, my boy: We will to sanctuary.

45:41.900 --> 45:43.900
Madam, farewell.

45:46.900 --> 45:50.900
Stay, I will go with you.

46:20.900 --> 46:23.700
Welcome, sweet Prince, to London.

46:23.900 --> 46:26.900
Welcome, dear cousin,
my thoughts' sovereign.

46:28.900 --> 46:32.850
The weary way hath made you melancholy.

46:32.900 --> 46:33.850
No, uncle.

46:33.900 --> 46:36.900
I want more uncles here to welcome me.

46:37.900 --> 46:40.900
Where are my uncles Rivers and Grey?

46:42.900 --> 46:44.850
Those uncles which you
want were dangerous;

46:44.900 --> 46:47.850
Your grace attended to
their sugar'd words,

46:47.900 --> 46:51.500
But look'd not on the
poison of their hearts.

46:51.900 --> 46:54.900
God keep you from them, and
from such false friends!

47:11.900 --> 47:14.900
My lord, the Mayor of
London comes to greet you!

47:16.900 --> 47:19.850
God bless your grace with
health and happy days!

47:19.900 --> 47:22.850
I thank you, good my
lord, and thank you all.

47:22.900 --> 47:24.850
My lord.

47:24.900 --> 47:27.040
My good Lord Stanley.

47:28.900 --> 47:30.850
The Queen your mother
and your brother York

47:30.900 --> 47:32.850
Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince

47:32.900 --> 47:34.850
Would fain have come with
me to meet your grace,

47:34.900 --> 47:37.850
But by his mother was perforce withheld.

47:37.900 --> 47:40.850
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course

47:40.900 --> 47:41.850
Is this of hers!

47:41.900 --> 47:44.850
Your holiness...

47:44.900 --> 47:45.850
will your grace,

47:45.900 --> 47:47.850
Persuade the Queen to
send the Duke of York

47:47.900 --> 47:49.850
Unto his princely brother presently?

47:49.900 --> 47:51.850
If she refuse, Lord Hastings, go with him

47:51.900 --> 47:54.850
And from her jealous
arms pluck him perforce.

47:54.900 --> 47:56.850
God in Heaven forbid

47:56.900 --> 47:58.850
We should infringe the holy privilege

47:58.900 --> 48:01.040
Of blessed sanctuary!

48:02.900 --> 48:06.000
You are too ceremonious and traditional.

48:07.900 --> 48:10.850
You break not sanctuary in seizing him!

48:10.900 --> 48:12.850
The benefit thereof is always granted

48:12.900 --> 48:15.850
To those whose dealings
have deserv'd the place,

48:15.900 --> 48:18.850
And those who have the
wit to claim the place.

48:18.900 --> 48:20.850
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,

48:20.900 --> 48:24.850
But sanctuary children, never till now.

48:39.900 --> 48:45.900
My lord, you shall
o'er-rule my mind for once.

48:46.900 --> 48:49.170
Come on, Lord Hastings.

49:00.900 --> 49:03.850
Say, uncle Gloucester,
when our brother comes,

49:03.900 --> 49:05.850
Where shall we sojourn
till our coronation?

49:05.900 --> 49:07.850
If I may counsel you, some day or two

49:07.900 --> 49:11.850
Your Highness shall
repose you at the Tower,

49:11.900 --> 49:14.850
Then after where you please
that shall be thought most fit

49:14.900 --> 49:16.850
For your best health and recreation.

49:16.900 --> 49:19.850
I do not like the Tower, of any place.

49:19.900 --> 49:22.850
Did Julius Caesar build
that place, my lord?

49:22.900 --> 49:24.850
He did, my lord, begin that place,

49:24.900 --> 49:27.900
Which since, succeeding
ages have re-edified.

49:29.900 --> 49:33.900
So wise so young, they
say, do never live long.

49:48.900 --> 49:50.300
Brother!

49:50.900 --> 49:53.850
And in good time here
comes the Duke of York.

49:53.900 --> 49:56.850
Richard of York: How
fares our loving brother?

49:56.900 --> 49:59.850
Well, my dread lord --
so must I call you now.

49:59.900 --> 50:04.850
How fares my cousin, noble Lord of York?

50:04.900 --> 50:06.850
I thank you, gentle uncle.

50:06.900 --> 50:07.850
O my lord,

50:07.900 --> 50:11.850
You said that idle weeds
are fast in growth.

50:11.900 --> 50:14.850
I did, my lord, but meant no harm.

50:14.900 --> 50:17.900
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.

50:19.900 --> 50:22.850
What, would you have
my weapon, little lord?

50:22.900 --> 50:25.850
I would, that I might
thank you as you call me.

50:25.900 --> 50:26.850
How?

50:26.900 --> 50:28.850
Little.

50:31.900 --> 50:35.850
My brother York will
still be cross in talk;

50:35.900 --> 50:38.850
Uncle, your grace knows
how to bear with him.

50:38.900 --> 50:41.850
You mean to bear me, not to bear with me;

50:41.900 --> 50:44.850
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me:

50:44.900 --> 50:46.850
Because that I am little like an ape,

50:46.900 --> 50:49.900
He thinks you should bear
me on your shoulders!

51:05.900 --> 51:09.850
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons:

51:09.900 --> 51:12.850
So cunning and so young is wonderful!

51:12.900 --> 51:15.850
My lord, will't please you pass along?

51:15.900 --> 51:17.850
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham

51:17.900 --> 51:20.850
Will to your mother, to entreat of her

51:20.900 --> 51:24.100
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.

51:24.900 --> 51:27.850
What, will you go to the Tower, my lord?

51:27.900 --> 51:31.850
My Lord Protector needs will have it so.

51:31.900 --> 51:34.850
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.

51:34.900 --> 51:36.850
Why, what should you fear?

51:36.900 --> 51:39.850
My uncle Clarence' angry ghost:

51:39.900 --> 51:43.100
My grandam told me he was murder'd there.

51:43.900 --> 51:45.850
I fear no uncles dead.

51:45.900 --> 51:47.850
Nor none that live, I hope?

51:47.900 --> 51:51.900
And if they live, I hope I need not fear.

51:52.900 --> 51:54.850
Go I unto the Tower.

51:54.900 --> 51:56.900
Come, brother.

52:06.900 --> 52:09.850
'Tis a parlous boy,

52:09.900 --> 52:14.900
Bold, ingenious, quick, forward, capable:

52:17.900 --> 52:19.850
He is all the mother's,
from the top to toe.

52:19.900 --> 52:21.970
Well, let them rest.

52:25.900 --> 52:28.040
Come hither, Catesby:

52:32.900 --> 52:37.850
Go now, gentle Catesby,
sound thou Hastings

52:37.900 --> 52:39.850
How he doth stand affected to our purpose,

52:39.900 --> 52:42.850
For the instalment of this noble Duke

52:42.900 --> 52:45.900
In the seat royal of this famous isle.

52:46.900 --> 52:48.850
Tell him, Catesby

52:48.900 --> 52:52.850
That his ancient knot
of dangerous adversaries

52:52.900 --> 52:56.900
Tomorrow shall be let
blood at Pomfret castle.

53:03.900 --> 53:06.850
What shall we do if we perceive

53:06.900 --> 53:09.850
Lord Hastings shall not
yield to our complots?

53:09.900 --> 53:12.170
Chop off his head, man.

53:13.900 --> 53:17.850
And look you when I am
King; claim thou of me

53:17.900 --> 53:20.850
The earldom of Hereford,
and all the moveables

53:20.900 --> 53:23.900
Thereof of which the King,
my brother, was possess'd.

53:29.900 --> 53:33.500
I'll claim that promise
at your grace's hand.

53:46.900 --> 53:48.570
Your Majesty.

53:49.900 --> 53:51.900
Prince Richard.

54:09.900 --> 54:11.850
Catesby?

54:11.900 --> 54:14.850
What news in this our tott'ring state?

54:14.900 --> 54:16.850
It is a reeling world indeed, my lord,

54:16.900 --> 54:19.850
And I believe will never stand upright

54:19.900 --> 54:23.300
Till Richard wear the
garland of the realm.

54:24.900 --> 54:27.850
How, wear the garland?
Dost thou mean the crown?

54:27.900 --> 54:29.900
Ay, my good lord.

54:30.900 --> 54:33.850
I'll have this crown of
mine cut from my shoulders

54:33.900 --> 54:36.850
Before I'll see the
crown so foul misplac'd.

54:36.900 --> 54:38.850
But canst thou guess
that he doth aim at it?

54:38.900 --> 54:40.850
Ay, upon my life,

54:40.900 --> 54:43.850
And thereupon he sends you this good news

54:43.900 --> 54:45.850
That tomorrow night Rivers and Grey,

54:45.900 --> 54:50.900
The kindred of the Queen,
must die at Pomfret.

54:54.900 --> 54:57.900
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news.

54:58.900 --> 55:00.850
Today shalt thou behold two subjects die

55:00.900 --> 55:04.850
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.

55:04.900 --> 55:07.850
God spare the Princes
from the pack of you.

55:07.900 --> 55:10.900
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!

55:11.900 --> 55:13.850
Dispatch: The limit of your lives is out.

55:13.900 --> 55:16.850
Now Margaret's curse is
fall'n upon our heads.

55:16.900 --> 55:19.850
Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.

55:19.900 --> 55:21.850
Pomfret! Pomfret!

55:21.900 --> 55:24.900
We give thee our guiltless blood to drink.

55:44.900 --> 55:46.040
Hm.

56:04.900 --> 56:07.850
Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met

56:07.900 --> 56:10.850
Is to determine of the
coronation of young Edward.

56:10.900 --> 56:12.850
Are all things ready for the royal time?

56:12.900 --> 56:15.850
They are, and wants but nomination.

56:15.900 --> 56:18.850
Tomorrow, then, I judge a happy day.

56:18.900 --> 56:21.900
Who knows the Lord
Protector's mind herein?

56:23.900 --> 56:26.900
Who is most inward with the noble Duke?

56:29.900 --> 56:34.900
Your grace, we think, should
soonest know his mind.

56:35.900 --> 56:39.850
We know each other's faces; for our hearts

56:39.900 --> 56:43.100
He knows no more of mine than I of yours.

56:43.900 --> 56:46.900
Lord Hastings, you and
he are near in love.

56:47.900 --> 56:50.850
I thank his grace, I know he loves me well

56:50.900 --> 56:52.850
But for his purpose in the coronation

56:52.900 --> 56:54.850
I have not sounded him.

56:54.900 --> 56:56.850
But you, my noble lords,
may name the time;

56:56.900 --> 57:00.850
And in the Duke's behalf
I'll give my voice.

57:00.900 --> 57:03.850
In happy time, here
comes the Duke himself.

57:03.900 --> 57:07.850
My noble lords and
cousins all, good morrow:

57:07.900 --> 57:10.850
I have been long a sleeper, but I trust

57:10.900 --> 57:13.850
My absence doth neglect no great design

57:13.900 --> 57:16.850
Which by my presence might
have been concluded.

57:16.900 --> 57:18.850
Had not you come upon your cue, my lord,

57:18.900 --> 57:22.850
William Lord Hastings had
pronounc'd your part --

57:22.900 --> 57:24.850
I mean your voice for
crowning of the King.

57:24.900 --> 57:31.850
Oh?... Than Lord Hastings
no man might be so bold:

57:31.900 --> 57:35.900
His lordship knows me
well, and loves me well.

57:39.900 --> 57:42.850
My Lord of Ely, last time I was in Holborn

57:42.900 --> 57:45.850
I saw good strawberries
in your garden there,

57:45.900 --> 57:47.850
I do beseech you, send for some of them.

57:47.900 --> 57:51.850
Marry, I will, my lord, with all my heart.

57:51.900 --> 57:54.900
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.

58:00.900 --> 58:03.850
We have not yet set
down this day of triumph.

58:03.900 --> 58:06.850
Tomorrow, in my judgment, is too sudden.

58:06.900 --> 58:11.850
Where is my lord Duke of Gloucester?
I have sent for these strawberries.

58:11.900 --> 58:14.850
His grace looks cheerfully
and smooth today:

58:14.900 --> 58:16.850
I think there's never a man in Christendom

58:16.900 --> 58:18.850
Can lesser hide his love and hate than he,

58:18.900 --> 58:21.850
For by his face straight
shall you know his heart.

58:21.900 --> 58:23.850
What of his heart perceive you in his face

58:23.900 --> 58:25.850
By any livelihood he show'd today?

58:25.900 --> 58:28.850
Marry, that with no man
here he is offended,

58:28.900 --> 58:31.850
For were he, he had shown it in his looks.

58:31.900 --> 58:34.440
I pray God he be not, I say.

58:37.900 --> 58:41.850
I pray you all, tell me
how they should be treated

58:41.900 --> 58:46.850
That do conspire my death
through devilish plots

58:46.900 --> 58:50.850
Of damned witchcraft, that have prevail'd

58:50.900 --> 58:53.850
Upon my body with their hellish charms?

58:53.900 --> 58:55.850
The tender love I bear your grace,

58:55.900 --> 58:58.850
Leads me to say they have deserved death.

58:58.900 --> 59:00.850
Then let your eyes be the
witness to their evil.

59:00.900 --> 59:03.850
See how I am bewitch'd!

59:03.900 --> 59:07.850
Behold, mine arm

59:07.900 --> 59:10.900
Is like a blasted sapling wither'd up!

59:12.900 --> 59:17.850
And this is Edward's wife,
that monstrous witch,

59:17.900 --> 59:21.850
That by her witchcraft
thus have marked me.

59:21.900 --> 59:23.850
If by this deed she have, my noble lord --

59:23.900 --> 59:26.900
- If?
- If?

59:30.900 --> 59:33.900
Thou protector of this damned strumpet,

59:35.900 --> 59:38.900
Talk'st thou to me of ifs!

59:40.900 --> 59:42.850
Thou art a traitor:

59:42.900 --> 59:44.900
Off with his head!

59:51.850 --> 59:52.850
Now by Saint Paul

59:52.900 --> 59:55.900
I shall not dine until I see the same!

59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.500
Catesby, look that it be done;

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:04.900
All the rest that love
me, rise and follow me.

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.850
The manner and the
purpose of his treasons,

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.850
My lords, you might signify

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.850
Unto the citizens, who haply may

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.850
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.850
I'll acquaint our duteous citizens

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.900
With all your just
proceedings in this cause.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:50.850
Go, cousin Buckingham,

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.850
To the Mayor and citizens at Guildhall.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:55.850
There, at your meet'st
advantage of the time,

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:59.000
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.900
O Catesby!

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.370
Please...

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.850
I dance attendance here.

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:06.200
I think the Duke will not be spoke withal.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.900
Now, Catesby, what says
your lord to my request?

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:16.850
He is within, with two
right reverend fathers,

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.850
Divinely bent to meditation;

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:21.850
And in no worldly suits would he be draw

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.850
To move him from his holy exercise.

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:28.850
Return, good Catesby,
to the gracious Duke;

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:32.850
Tell him myself, the Mayor and aldermen,

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:35.850
In deep design, in matter of great moment,

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:38.850
Are come to have some
conference with his grace.

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:41.900
I'll signify so much unto him straight.

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:48.850
Ah ha, my lords, this
Prince is not an Edward:

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:51.850
He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed,

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.850
But on his knees at meditation.

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.850
Happy were England, would
this virtuous Prince

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.850
Take on his graces the
sovereignty thereof.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.850
God defend his grace should say us nay!

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:04.850
I fear he will.

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:09.850
Now, Catesby, what says his grace?

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.850
He wonders to what end you have assembled

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:14.850
Such troops of citizens to come to him.

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.900
He fears, my lord, you
mean no good to him.

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:24.850
By heaven, we come to him in perfect love:

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:27.900
And so once more return
and tell his grace.

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:35.850
When holy and devout religious men

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.850
Are at their beads, 'tis
much to draw them thence,

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.900
So sweet is zealous contemplation.

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:47.850
See where his grace kneels,
'tween two clergymen!

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:51.900
And see, a book of prayer in his hand!

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:59.850
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious Prince,

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:02.850
Lend favourable ears to our requests,

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.850
And pardon us the interruption

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:07.900
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:12.850
I do suspect that I have done some offence

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:15.900
Which seems disgracious in the City's eye.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:21.850
We heartily solicit

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:25.850
Your gracious self to
take on you the charge

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:29.850
And kingly government of this, your land,

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:33.850
Your right of birth,
your empery, your own.

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:37.850
God be thank'd, there is no need of me.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:41.900
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:46.850
The dear Prince, safely
in the Tower stowed,

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:50.850
Who will bring us all
happiness by his reign.

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:52.850
On him I lay that you would lay on me:

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.850
You say that Edward is your brother's son:

01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:57.850
Mm.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:02.850
So say we too -- but not by Edward's wife!

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:06.850
For first he was contract to Lady Bona.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.850
This Elizabeth, a poor widow,

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.850
Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:17.850
To base declension and loath'd bigamy.

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:21.850
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:26.850
This little Edward, whom we call a Prince.

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:33.850
Then, good my lord,
take to your royal self

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.850
This proffer'd benefit of dignity.

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:39.850
Do, my good lord: Your
citizens entreat you.

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:44.850
Alas, why would you heap this care on me?

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:48.900
I am unfit for state and majesty.

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:55.850
I cannot, and I will not, yield to you.

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.850
If you refuse it,

01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:59.850
As well we know your tenderness of heart,

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:02.850
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse.

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:06.850
Yet know, your brother's son
shall never reign our King,

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.850
But we will plant some other in the throne

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:13.850
To the disgrace and
downfall of this, your House;

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:15.850
And with this resolution
here we leave you.

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.850
Come, citizens; zounds,
I'll entreat no more.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.850
O, do not swear, my Lord of Buckingham!

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.850
Call him again, sweet
Prince; accept their suit.

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:26.850
If you deny them, all
the land will rue it.

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:30.850
Will you entreat me to a world of cares?

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:31.850
Call them again!

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.900
Lord Buckingham!

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.850
I am not made of stone.

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:45.850
My cousin of Buckingham,
and sage, grave men,

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:48.850
If you do buckle fortune on my back,

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:52.900
I must have patience to endure the load.

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:58.850
But God doth know, and you may partly see,

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:01.850
How far I am from the desire of this.

01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:05.850
God bless your grace: We
see it, and will say it.

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:09.850
And in saying so, you
do but say the truth.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:13.850
Then I salute you with this royal title:

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:17.850
Long live Richard, England's worthy King!

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:21.899
Long live Richard, England's worthy King!

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:32.850
Tomorrow may it please you to be crown'd?

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:36.850
Even when you please,
for you will have it so.

01:08:36.899 --> 01:08:39.850
And so most joyfully we take our leave.

01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:42.899
And I will to my holy work again.

01:08:43.899 --> 01:08:48.899
Farewell, my cousin,
farewell, gentle friends.

01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:26.700
Open this gate!

01:09:27.899 --> 01:09:29.899
Who meets us here?

01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:37.850
God give your graces both A
happy and a joyful time of day.

01:09:37.899 --> 01:09:40.899
- As much to you, good sister.
- What make you here?

01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:43.850
As I guess,

01:09:43.899 --> 01:09:45.850
Upon the like devotion as yourselves:

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:47.850
To gratulate the gentle Princes here.

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:51.899
Kind sister, thanks;
we'll enter all together.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:00.850
Master Lieutenant, pray you by your leave:

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.850
How doth the Prince, and
my young son of York?

01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:05.170
Right well, dear madam.

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:11.850
By your patience, I may not
suffer you to visit them.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.850
The King hath strictly
charged the contrary.

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.850
The King! Who's that?

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.850
I mean the Lord Protector.

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.850
The Lord protect him
from that kingly title!

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.850
I am their mother. Who
shall bar me from them?

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:22.850
I am their father's
mother. I will see them.

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:26.850
Their aunt I am in law,
in love their mother:

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.850
Then bring me to their sights.

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:31.850
No, madam, no. I may not leave it so:

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.900
I am bound by oath, and
therefore pardon me.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.850
Come, madam, you must
straight to Westminster,

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.850
There to be crowned Richard's royal Queen.

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:46.850
O, cut my lace asunder,

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.850
Or else I swoon with
this dead-killing news!

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:52.850
Spiteful tidings!

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:55.850
O, unpleasing news!

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:58.700
O, ill-dispersing wind of misery!

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.850
O, my accursed womb, the bed of death!

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:05.850
A cockatrice hast thou
hatch'd to the world,

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.850
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.850
Come, madam, come. I in all haste am sent.

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:13.850
Would to God that the inclusive verge

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:17.850
Of golden metal that must round my brow

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:23.900
Were red-hot steel, to
sear me to the brains!

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.850
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:32.850
And die, ere men can say,
"God save the Queen!"

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:35.850
Go, go, poor soul,

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.100
I envy not your glory.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.850
Go thou to Richard,

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.300
And good angels tend thee!

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.770
Stand all apart.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.040
Cousin of Buckingham!

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:47.850
My gracious sovereign?

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:49.840
Give me thy hand.

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:49.850
God save King Richard,

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.850
Third of that name.

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.900
God save the King!

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:53.300
Richard.

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.850
Buckingham.

01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:07.850
Thus high, by thy advice
and thy assistance,

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.170
Is King Richard seated.

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:13.850
But shall we wear these glories for a day?

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:17.300
Or shall they last, and
we rejoice in them?

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:21.300
Still live they and for
ever let them last!

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:23.900
Young Edward lives.

01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:29.850
I say, I would be King.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:33.850
Why, so you are, my thrice renowned lord.

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:35.850
Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:37.850
Shall I be plain?

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.850
I wish the bastards dead.

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.900
And I would have it suddenly perform'd.

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:48.900
What sayest thou now? Speak suddenly.

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:52.640
Your grace may do your pleasure.

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:57.370
Tut, tut.

01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.850
Thou art all ice,

01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:02.850
Thy kindness freezes:

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:06.900
Say, have I thy consent
that they shall die?

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:13.850
Give me some little breath,
some pause, dear lord,

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:16.700
Before I positively speak in this.

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:20.900
I will resolve you herein presently.

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:29.850
- Catesby!
- My lord?

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:31.850
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:34.850
Might tempt unto a close exploit of death?

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:36.850
I know a discontented gentleman.

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.850
Gold will, no doubt,
tempt him to anything.

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:41.850
- What is his name?
- His name, my lord, is Tyrell.

01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:44.900
I partly know the man. Have him sent for.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.850
The deep-revolving witty Buckingham

01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:02.850
No more shall be the
neighbour to my counsels:

01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:05.850
Hath he so long held out with me untired,

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:08.440
And stops he now for breath?

01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:13.700
Well, be it so.

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:28.700
How now, Stanley! What's the news?

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:32.850
Know, my loving lord, that the
Earl of Richmond Henry Tudor

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:34.850
Is on the move in France.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:37.850
He comes to claim your
crown, has followers

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.440
And marches toward the coast.

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:49.850
Stanley, Richmond is thy wife's son.

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.850
Well, look unto it.

01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:59.850
Come hither, Catesby.

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:03.850
Rumour it abroad that Anne, my
wife, is very grievous sick:

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:07.000
I will take order for her keeping close.

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:12.900
Look, how thou dream'st! I say again.

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:20.900
Give out that Anne my Queen
is sick and like to die.

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.850
For it stands upon me

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:30.500
To stop all hopes whose
growth may damage me.

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:33.370
About it.

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:47.850
Is thy name Tyrell?

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:50.900
James Tyrell, and your
most obedient subject.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.850
Art thou, indeed?

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.370
Prove me, my gracious lord.

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:01.850
Darest thou resolve to
kill a friend of mine?

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:04.900
So please you. I'd
rather kill two enemies.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.850
Why, then thou hast it:

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:11.850
Two deep enemies,

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.850
Foes to my unrest,

01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:17.850
My sweet sleep's disturbers

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:21.200
Are they that I would have thee deal upon.

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:26.900
Tyrell, I mean those
bastards in the Tower.

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.850
Let me have open means to come to them,

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.900
And soon I'll rid you of the fear of them.

01:19:36.850 --> 01:19:37.850
Say it is done,

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:41.500
And I will love thee,
and prefer thee for it.

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:45.440
I will dispatch it straight.

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:58.850
My lord, I have consider'd in my mind

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.850
The late request that you did...

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:02.970
Well, let that rest.

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.850
My lord, I claim the
gift, my due by promise,

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:10.850
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.850
which you have promised I shall possess.

01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:14.850
Stanley, look to your wife.

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:18.900
If she convey letters to
Richmond, you shall answer it.

01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:26.900
What says your highness to my just demand?

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:30.850
I do remember me

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:33.850
Henry the Sixth did prophesy
that Richmond should be King,

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.850
when Richmond was a little peevish boy.

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:41.900
A King, perhaps, perhaps.

01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:46.850
My lord, your promise for the earldom.

01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:48.370
Richmond!

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:52.850
When I was last at Exeter,

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:57.850
The mayor in courtesy
show'd me the castle,

01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:58.850
And call'd it Rougemont:

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:01.850
At which name I started,

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:03.850
Because a bard of Ireland told me once

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:06.900
I should not live long
after I saw Richmond.

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:10.850
My lord!

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:16.900
I am not in the giving vein today.

01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:35.900
My lord?

01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:55.370
Leave us.

01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:27.850
All hail for my sovereign lord!

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.850
Kind Tyrell, am I happy by thy news?

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:32.370
Brakenbury is burying them.

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:35.850
Come to me again, Tyrell, in the morning.

01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:38.900
Meantime, but think how
I may do thee good.

01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:44.850
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims

01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:47.850
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,

01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:49.850
And, by that knot, looks
proudly at the crown,

01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:53.850
To her I'll go, a jolly thriving wooer.

01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:56.900
- My lord! - Good or bad news,
that thou comest in so bluntly?

01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:59.850
Bad, my lord.

01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:03.850
The Bishop of Ely flies to France
to join with Richmond's power there,

01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:08.850
And Buckingham, back'd
with the hardy Welshmen,

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:11.850
Takes to the field, and
still his power increaseth.

01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:13.850
Ely with Richmond touches me more near

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:17.850
Than Buckingham with his
rash-levied strength.

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:19.850
Go, muster men:

01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:21.850
My counsel is my shield.

01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.900
We must be brief when
traitors brave the field.

01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:27.040
Ah!

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.900
My poor princes!

01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:37.900
Ah, my tender babes!

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:45.850
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:48.900
Hover about me with your airy wings!

01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:55.850
So many miseries have crazed my voice,

01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:59.850
That my woe-wearied
tongue is still and mute.

01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:05.850
Wilt thou, O God, fly
from such gentle lambs,

01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:08.850
And throw them in the
entrails of the wolf?

01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:14.850
Dead life, blind sight,
poor mortal living ghost,

01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:18.850
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:21.850
Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood!

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.850
O!

01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:26.850
Thou wouldst as soon afford a grave

01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:29.900
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:34.900
O, who hath any cause to mourn but we?

01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:58.900
I call'd thee once poor
shadow, painted Queen.

01:27:59.850 --> 01:28:00.850
Where is thy husband now?

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:02.850
Where be thy brother?

01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:05.850
Where be the thronging
troops that follow'd thee?

01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:09.850
Decline all this, and
see what now thou art:

01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:13.900
For happy wife, a most distressed widow.

01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:19.900
For joyful mother, one
that wails the name.

01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:22.850
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.850
That I should wish for
thee to help me curse

01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:30.850
That bottled spider, that
foul bunchbacked toad!

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:33.850
I had a husband till a Richard kill'd him.

01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:36.850
Thou hadst two sons till
a Richard kill'd them.

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.900
I had a husband, and thou didst kill him.

01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:42.850
I had an Edmund too,
and thou didst kill him.

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:46.850
Thou hadst a Clarence too,
and Richard kill'd him.

01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:49.850
From forth the kennel
of thy womb hath crept

01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:52.850
A hell-hound that doth
hunt us all to death.

01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:56.900
O, Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!

01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:00.900
God witness, I have wept enough for thee.

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.570
Bear with me.

01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:17.900
I am hungry for revenge,

01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:26.850
Clarence, Hastings,
Rivers, Grey, and Anne,

01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:31.850
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:37.850
Richard yet lives, hell's
black intelligencer.

01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:42.850
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:47.850
That I may live and say,

01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:51.900
The dog is dead!

01:29:54.900 --> 01:30:00.850
O, thou well skill'd
in curses, stay awhile,

01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:03.900
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.850
Forbear to sleep the
nights, and fast the days.

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:13.900
Compare dead happiness with living woe.

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:18.850
Think that thy babes were
sweeter than they were,

01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:23.850
And he that slew them fouler than he is:

01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:28.850
Revolving this will
teach thee how to curse.

01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:30.900
My words are dull.

01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:33.850
O, quicken them with thine!

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:36.850
Thy woes will make them
sharp, and pierce like mine.

01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:39.850
If so, then be not
tongue-tied: go with me.

01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:42.850
And with the breath of
bitter words let's smother

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:47.900
My damned son, that thy
two sweet sons smother'd.

01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:21.850
Most mighty sovereign,

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:24.850
On the western coast rideth the
puissant navy to our shores.

01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:26.850
'Tis thought that
Richmond is their admiral,

01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:28.850
And there they hull, expecting but the aid

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:31.850
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.

01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:34.850
Some light-footed friend
post to the Duke of Norfolk:

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:35.850
Ratcliffe, thyself, or Catesby.

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:38.850
Catesby! Fly to the Duke.
Ratcliffe, come hither.

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:40.850
Post to Salisbury

01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:43.570
And when thou comest thither...

01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:45.850
Unmindful villain,

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:48.900
Why stand'st thou here,
and go'st not to the Duke?

01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:54.850
Tell me what your highness' pleasure is.

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:57.850
What would you have me
deliver to the Duke?

01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:58.850
Bid him straight to levy

01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:01.850
The greatest strength
and power he can make,

01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.850
And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.

01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:04.850
I go.

01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:07.850
What shall it please you
shall I do at Salisbury?

01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.850
Why, what wouldst thou there before I go?

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:13.850
Your highness told me
I should post before.

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:15.900
My mind is changed.

01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:18.850
Stanley, what's the news with you?

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:20.850
Richmond is on the seas.

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:24.600
He makes for England,
here to claim the crown.

01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:33.850
Is the chair empty? Is the sword unsway'd?

01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:38.900
Is the King dead? The empire unpossess'd?

01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:44.850
What heir of York is there alive but we?

01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:48.850
And who is England's King
but great York's heir?

01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:52.900
Then tell me, what makes he upon the seas?

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:56.900
Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.

01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:03.850
Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:06.850
He is thy step-son.

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:08.850
No, my good lord,
therefore mistrust me not.

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:10.850
Where is thine army,
then, to beat him back?

01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:12.850
Are they now upon the western shore

01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:15.850
Safe-conducting the
rebels from their ships?

01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:17.850
No, my good lord, my
friends are in the north.

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:19.850
Cold friends to me: What
do they in the north,

01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:21.850
When they should serve their
sovereign in the west?

01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:24.850
They have not been commanded, mighty King.

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:26.850
Pleaseth Your Majesty to give me leave,

01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:29.850
I'll muster up my friends,
and meet your grace

01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:32.850
Where and what time Your
Majesty shall please.

01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:34.850
Ay, ay.

01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:39.900
Thou wouldst be gone
to join with Richmond.

01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:43.170
But I'll not trust thee.

01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:45.850
Most mighty sovereign,

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:48.850
You have no cause to hold
my friendship doubtful:

01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:51.900
I never was nor never will be false.

01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:57.240
Go, then, and muster men.

01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:01.900
But leave behind your son, George Stanley.

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:07.850
Look your heart be firm.

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:10.900
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.

01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:14.900
So deal with him as I prove true to you.

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.850
My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken.

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:37.850
That is the best news:

01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:38.850
That the Earl of Richmond

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:40.850
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford

01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.900
Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.

01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:49.850
Away. Away!

01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:51.850
While we reason here,

01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:54.900
A royal battle might be won and lost.

01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:57.900
Halt!

01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:10.850
Who intercepts me in my expedition?

01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:13.850
O, she that should have intercepted thee,

01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:16.850
By strangling thee in her accursed womb

01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:20.850
From all the slaughters,
wretch, that thou hast done!

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:24.850
Tell me, thou villain slave,
where are my children?

01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:27.850
Thou toad, thou toad, where
is thy brother Clarence?

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:30.850
Where are the gentle
Rivers, the sweet Grey?

01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:32.850
Where is kind Hastings?

01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:35.850
A husband and a son thou owest to me.

01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:36.850
Strike!

01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:38.850
Strike alarum, drums!

01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:42.600
Let not the heavens hear
these tell-tale women.

01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:45.850
Strike, I say!

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:46.850
Art thou my son?

01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:51.850
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:53.850
- O, let me speak!
- Do, then: but I'll not listen.

01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:55.850
I will be mild and gentle in my words.

01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.850
And brief, good mother, for I am in haste.

01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:00.850
Art thou so hasty?

01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:02.850
I have stay'd for thee,

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:03.850
God knows,

01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:06.170
In torment and in agony.

01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:16.600
Thou camest on Earth to
make the Earth my hell.

01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:19.850
A grievous burden was thy birth to me.

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:22.850
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy.

01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:26.850
Thy school-days frightful,
desperate, wild, and furious,

01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:31.850
Thy prime of manhood
daring, bold, and venturous,

01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:36.850
Thy age confirm'd, proud,
subtle, sly and bloody,

01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:42.900
More mild, and yet more
harmful, kind in hatred.

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:46.850
What comfortable hour canst thou name,

01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:49.900
That ever graced me with thy company?

01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.850
If I be so disgracious in your eye,

01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:56.900
Let me march on, and
not offend you, madam.

01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:00.850
Strike up the drum!

01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:02.850
I prithee, hear me speak.

01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:04.850
You speak too bitterly.

01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:06.850
Hear me a word,

01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:09.900
For I shall never speak to thee again.

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:23.850
Either thou wilt die
by God's just ordinance,

01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:25.850
Ere from this battle
thou return conqueror,

01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:28.850
Or I with grief shall perish

01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:31.840
And nevermore behold thy face again.

01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:36.850
Therefore take with thee
my most grievous curse

01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.850
Which, in the day of
battle, tire thee more

01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:42.900
Than all the complete
armour that thou wear'st!

01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:48.850
My prayers on the adverse party fight,

01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:51.850
And there the little souls
of Edward's children

01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.850
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies

01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:57.900
And promise them success and victory.

01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:03.850
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end.

01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:07.900
Shame serves thy life and
doth thy death attend.

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:17.850
Though far more cause, yet
much less spirit to curse

01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:20.900
Abides in me, I say amen to her.

01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:24.570
Stay, madam.

01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:28.440
I must talk a word with you.

01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:43.850
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,

01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:47.850
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.

01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:50.300
And must she die for this?

01:39:51.850 --> 01:39:52.850
O, let her live,

01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:55.850
And I'll corrupt her
manners, stain her beauty

01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:58.850
So she may live unscarr'd
of bleeding slaughter.

01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:00.850
I will confess she was
not Edward's daughter.

01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:03.850
Her life is safest only in her birth.

01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:06.900
And only in that safety died her brothers.

01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:11.850
You speak as if that I
had slain my cousins.

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:12.850
Cousins, indeed.

01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:16.850
And by their uncle cozened
of comfort, kingdom,

01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:19.900
Kindred, freedom, life.

01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:26.850
Madam, know that from my
soul I love thy daughter

01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:30.900
And do intend to make
her Queen of England.

01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:33.850
Well, then, who doth thou
mean shall be her King?

01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:35.850
Even he that makes her
Queen, who else should be?

01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:37.850
- What, thou?
- Even so.

01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:39.850
How think you of it?

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:40.850
How canst thou woo her?

01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:41.850
That would I learn of you,

01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:44.850
As one that are best
acquainted with her humour.

01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:46.850
What were I best to say?

01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:50.850
Her father's brother would be her
lord? Or shall I say her uncle?

01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:53.850
Or he that slew her
brothers and her uncles?

01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:56.900
But in your daughter's womb, I bury them.

01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:00.850
Wherein that nest of spicery they
will breed selves of themselves

01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:02.850
To your recomforture.

01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:06.850
Under what title shall I woo for thee?

01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:10.850
That God, the law, my honour and her love,

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:12.850
Can make seem pleasing
to her tender years?

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:15.850
Say, she shall be a high and mighty Queen.

01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:17.850
To wail the title, as her mother doth.

01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:20.850
- I swear...
- What canst thou swear by now?

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.850
God and fortune bar me happy hours!

01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:25.850
Day, yield me not thy
light, nor, night, thy rest!

01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:28.850
Be opposite all planets of
good luck to my proceedings if,

01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:29.850
With dear heart's love,

01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:32.900
I tender not thy beauteous
princely daughter!

01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:40.900
In her consists my happiness and thine.

01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:46.850
Without her follows to myself and thee,

01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:50.900
Death, desolation, ruin and decay.

01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:56.700
It cannot be avoided but by this.

01:41:56.900 --> 01:41:59.900
It will not be avoided but by this.

01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:06.850
Look, what is done cannot be now amended.

01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:09.850
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,

01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:11.850
To make amends I'll
give it to your daughter.

01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:14.850
Therefore, dear mother,

01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.900
I must call you so.

01:42:18.850 --> 01:42:19.850
Be the attorney of my love to her,

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:22.900
Plead what I will be,
not what I have been.

01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:29.850
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?

01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:32.900
Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.

01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:38.850
I go.

01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:40.850
Write to me very shortly,

01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:43.900
And you shall understand from me her mind.

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:47.240
Bear my true love's kiss.

01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:56.770
And so farewell.

01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:01.850
Relenting fool,

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:04.170
Shallow, changing woman!

01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:08.570
Your Majesty.

01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:22.850
Majesty.

01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:25.100
Strike alarums, drums!

01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:48.850
Gentle Blunt, tell Richmond this from me,

01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:51.850
That in the sty of this most deadly boar

01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:55.850
My son George Stanley
is franked up in hold.

01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:58.850
If I revolt, off goes young George's head.

01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:02.200
The fear of that holds off my present aid.

01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:05.850
So get thee gone. Commend
me to thy holy lord.

01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:09.850
Withal say, the Queen hath heartly
consented that he should espouse

01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:11.850
Elizabeth her daughter.

01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:13.850
But tell me, where is
princely Richmond now?

01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:16.850
At Pembroke in Wales, and towards
Bosworth does he bend his power,

01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:19.850
If by the way they be not fought withal.

01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:22.850
Well, hie thee to thy
lord. I kiss his hand.

01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:25.900
My letter will resolve him of my mind.

01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:28.900
Farewell.

01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:29.850
Will not King Richard
let me speak with him?

01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:31.900
< No, my good lord.

01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:36.100
Therefore, be patient.

01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:39.850
This is All-Souls' Day,
Catesby, is it not?

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.240
It is.

01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:46.900
Why, then All-Souls' Day
is my body's doomsday.

01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:51.850
Thus Margaret's curse
falls heavy on my neck,

01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:55.900
"When he," quoth she, "shall
split thy heart with sorrow!"

01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:02.900
Come, Catesby, lead me
to the block of shame.

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:11.900
Wrong hath but wrong, and
blame the due of blame.

01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:15.040
Lead on, executioner.

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:49.850
The weary sun hath made a golden set,

01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:51.850
And by the bright track of his fiery car

01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:54.900
Gives token of a goodly day tomorrow.

01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:57.850
Where is Lord Stanley
quartered, do you know?

01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:59.850
His regiment lies half
a mile at least south

01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:03.100
From the mighty power of the King's camp.

01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:05.850
Sweet Blunt.

01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:07.850
Make some good means to speak with him

01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:09.850
And give him from me
this most needful note.

01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:13.850
Upon my life, my lord, I'll undertake it.

01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:16.500
Goodnight, good Captain Blunt.

01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:22.850
Come, gentlemen, let us consult
upon tomorrow's business.

01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:25.900
Into my tent. The dew is raw and cold.

01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:38.850
I will not sup tonight.

01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:41.170
Fill me a bowl of wine.

01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:47.850
Is my visor easier than it was? Is
all my armour laid into my tent?

01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:50.900
It is, my liege, and all
things are in readiness.

01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:02.840
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!

01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:08.850
All comfort that the dark night can afford

01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:11.850
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!

01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:14.850
In brief, for so the season bids us be,

01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:16.850
Prepare thy battle early in the morning.

01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:18.850
With best advantage I'll deceive the time,

01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:21.850
And aid thee in this
doubtful shock of arms.

01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:24.850
But on thy side I may not be too forward

01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:28.850
Lest, being seen, thy
brother, tender George,

01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:31.850
Be executed in his father's sight.

01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:34.850
Radcliff, send out a messenger
to Stanley's regiment:

01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:36.850
Bid him bring his power

01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:39.850
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall

01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:42.900
Into the blind cave of eternal night.

01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:46.900
O thou, whose captain I account myself,

01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:50.850
Look on my forces with a gracious eye.

01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:53.850
Make us thy ministers of chastisement

01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:56.900
That we may praise thee in the victory!

01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:00.900
To thee I do commend my watchful soul.

01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:42.850
When I was mortal,

01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:48.900
My anointed body by thee was
punched full of deadly holes.

01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:56.900
Harry the Sixth bids
thee despair, and die!

01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:26.900
Poor George Clarence, by
thee betrayed to death.

01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:31.850
Tomorrow in the battle think on me,

01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:34.900
And fall thy edgeless sword.

01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:40.850
Despair, and die!

01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:52.600
The first was I that
helped thee to the crown.

01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:56.850
The last was I that felt thy tyranny.

01:50:56.900 --> 01:51:01.850
Dream on, dream on, of
bloody deeds and death;

01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:06.900
Fainting, despair;
despairing, yield thy breath!

01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:12.850
Richard, thy wife,

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:16.900
That wretched Anne, thy wife,

01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:21.850
Never slept a quiet hour with thee,

01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:24.850
Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.

01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:29.850
Tomorrow in the battle, think on me.

01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:32.850
Despair and die.

01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:40.850
Dream on thy cousins
smothered in the Tower.

01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.850
Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard,

01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:47.850
And weigh thee down to
ruin, shame, and death!

01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:52.850
Thy nephews' souls bid
thee despair and die!

01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:12.850
Jesu!

01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:29.900
O, coward conscience, how
dost thou afflict me!

01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:35.900
Cold, fearful drops stand
on my trembling flesh.

01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:40.900
What do I fear? Myself?

01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:46.900
There's none else by. Is
there a murderer here? No.

01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:51.100
Yes.

01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:55.170
I am.

01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:03.850
My conscience hath a
thousand several tongues,

01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:07.850
And every tongue brings in a several tale,

01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:12.900
And every tale condemns me for a villain.

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:28.770
I shall despair.

01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:34.900
There is no creature loves me!

01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:41.900
And if I die, no soul will pity me.

01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:45.850
And wherefore should they?

01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:51.900
Since I myself find in
myself no pity to myself.

01:53:53.850 --> 01:53:54.850
My lord?

01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:57.850
Your friends are up, and
buckle on their armour.

01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:01.900
Catesby, I have dreamed a fearful dream!

01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:07.900
- Will our friends prove all true?
- No doubt, my lord.

01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:11.850
O, by the apostle Paul, shadows to-night

01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:13.850
Have struck more terror
to the soul of Richard

01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:16.900
Than can the presence of 10,000 soldiers.

01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:38.850
It is not yet near day.

01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:40.770
Come, armour me.

01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:53.850
How have you slept, my lord?

01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:55.850
The sweetest sleep, and
fairest-boding dreams

01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:57.850
That ever entered in a drowsy head.

01:54:57.900 --> 01:54:59.850
How far into the morning is it?

01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:01.850
Upon the stroke of four.

01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:05.100
Then 'tis time to arm and give direction.

01:55:12.850 --> 01:55:13.850
Come, Radcliff, bustle!

01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:15.850
Caparison my horse!

01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:19.100
I will lead my men forth unto the plains.

01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:38.900
Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge.

01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:42.850
Our strong arms be our conscience,

01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:45.850
Our swords our law.

01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:48.850
Remember whom you are to cope withal.

01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:54.850
A sort of vagabonds,
rascals, and runaways.

01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:59.850
A scum of Bretons, and
base lackey peasants.

01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:03.900
Loving countrymen, remember this.

01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:07.850
If you do swear to put a tyrant down,

01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:11.850
You sleep in peace, the
tyrant being slain.

01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:15.850
And who doth lead them
but a paltry fellow,

01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:20.850
Long kept in Bretagne at our
brother's cost. A milk-sop!

01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:24.850
If you do free your
children from the sword,

01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:26.850
Your children's children
requite it in your age.

01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:28.850
One who never in his life

01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:32.850
Felt so much cold as o'er shoes in snow?

01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:35.850
Let's whip these
stragglers o'er seas again.

01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:38.850
In the name of God and all these rights...

01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:42.850
- Shall we let them
enjoy our lands? - Nay!

01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:44.850
- Lay with our wives?
- Nay!

01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:46.850
Ravage our daughters?

01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:49.370
Draw your willing swords...

01:56:51.850 --> 01:56:52.850
For if we thrive,

01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:56.900
The gain of our attempt the least
of you shall share his part thereof.

01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:01.850
Advance our standards! Set upon our foes!

01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:05.850
Sound drums and trumpets,
boldly and cheerfully.

01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:07.850
God and St George!

01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:10.850
Richmond and victory!

01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:14.850
Let us to it pell-mell!

01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:18.850
If not to heaven, then
hand in hand to hell!

01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:21.850
Rescue! Rescue, rescue!

01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:24.900
The King's horse is slain!

01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:28.440
Rescue, else the day is lost!

01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:35.850
A horse, a horse!

01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:38.850
My kingdom for a horse!

01:59:38.900 --> 01:59:41.850
Withdraw, my lord, I'll
help you to a horse.

01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:43.240
Slave!

01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:51.850
I think there be six
Richmonds in the field.

01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:55.900
Five have I slain today instead of him.

01:59:56.900 --> 01:59:59.850
A horse, a horse!

01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:02.900
My kingdom for a horse!

02:00:04.900 --> 02:00:06.900
Your arm, my lord.

02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:11.900
Catesby!

02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:27.900
God and your arms be praised.

02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:34.900
Victorious friends, the day is ours.

02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:39.170
The bloody dog is dead.

02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:43.970
Courageous Richmond.

02:02:48.900 --> 02:02:51.370
Well hast thou acquit thee.

02:02:52.900 --> 02:02:56.900
But tell me, is young
George Stanley living?

02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:14.300
Father!

02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:19.850
Great God of Heaven, say amen to all!

02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:21.170
Amen.

02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:34.840
My brother Henry.

02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:44.900
Oh, here this long-usurped royalty.

02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:51.900
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.

02:03:57.900 --> 02:04:00.850
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled

02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:03.850
That in submission will return to us.

02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:08.850
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,

02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:11.900
We will unite the white rose and the red.

02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:47.850
God save King Henry, seventh of that name.

02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:50.900
God save the King.

02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:07.900
England hath long been
mad and scarred herself.

02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:12.900
The brother blindly
shed the brother's blood.

02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:18.900
The son, compelled,
been butcher to the sire.

02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:26.900
All this divided York and Lancaster,
divided in their dire division.

02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:37.850
O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,

02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:41.850
The true succeeders of each royal house,

02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:45.100
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together.

02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:49.900
Now civil wounds are
stopped, peace lives again.

02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:56.900
That she may long live here, God say amen.

02:05:57.900 --> 02:05:59.170
Amen.

02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:50.500
