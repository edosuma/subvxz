01:48.810 --> 01:49.810
Push!

01:52.820 --> 01:55.900
Oh, God, it's coming!

02:01.950 --> 02:03.750
Oh, God, it's coming!

02:12.460 --> 02:13.460
No!

02:24.640 --> 02:26.640
Please, give him to me.

02:55.510 --> 02:56.510
Please.

03:01.010 --> 03:04.600
No. Please, my baby.
Please, give him to me.

03:07.930 --> 03:09.730
Damn you!

03:16.150 --> 03:18.610
When Michael Myers was six years old,

03:18.950 --> 03:23.160
he stabbed his sister to death.

03:26.950 --> 03:33.540
For years he was locked up,
locked away in Smith's Grove Sanitarium.

03:36.210 --> 03:37.590
But he escaped.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.470
And suddenly...

03:39.800 --> 03:43.680
Halloween was another word for mayhem.

03:46.640 --> 03:51.100
He needed to wipe out his entire family.

03:53.190 --> 03:57.110
He struck them down at night,
and always on Halloween.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.200
The police tried
everything to stop him.

04:06.030 --> 04:13.430
He overcame them all
and disappeared.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.760
The world thought him dead,

04:19.420 --> 04:23.300
But I... I wasn't sure.

04:24.260 --> 04:28.720
I wasn't sure that
Michael Myers had died.

04:43.910 --> 04:47.070
Jamie, come to me.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.960
Jamie, come to me.

05:16.940 --> 05:18.110
Jamie...

05:18.730 --> 05:20.610
Come with me if you
want to save your baby.

05:23.950 --> 05:26.700
- Oh, God... He's coming.
- We've got to move, now.

05:27.700 --> 05:28.700
Come on.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.630
No! Oh, God.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.800
Come on.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.980
It's okay!

06:00.980 --> 06:02.780
You can do it.
You can do it.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.030
There!

06:13.130 --> 06:13.990
It's that way!

06:14.660 --> 06:20.500
Go, now. Save your baby! Go now!

06:47.740 --> 06:48.740
Jamie?

06:51.620 --> 06:52.820
Jamie?

08:27.290 --> 08:28.120
Hey!

08:28.220 --> 08:29.420
What are you doing in my truck?

08:29.630 --> 08:30.580
Run!

08:30.680 --> 08:32.679
What the hell're you doing in my truck?

08:32.929 --> 08:33.730
What?

08:33.830 --> 08:34.630
Run!

08:37.140 --> 08:38.140
What?

09:19.220 --> 09:21.820
Danny. Danny.

09:23.140 --> 09:25.770
- Kill for him.
- Mommy!

09:27.650 --> 09:28.650
Danny?

09:32.740 --> 09:33.990
Mommy's here.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.910
What is it, baby?

09:36.450 --> 09:38.410
The Voiceman. He's here.

09:40.370 --> 09:43.450
- No one's there, sweetheart.
- But I've seen him.

09:43.660 --> 09:46.040
You've been watching way
too much TV, you know that?

09:46.250 --> 09:48.580
He says things. Bad things.

09:48.790 --> 09:49.960
Like what?

09:51.800 --> 09:52.800
Okay.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.930
Stay away monsters,
stay away ghouls.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.640
Stay away from Danny,
you jerks know the rules.

10:05.850 --> 10:08.450
Better? Here.

10:26.620 --> 10:27.670
Good night, Danny.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.120
Good night, mom.

10:37.300 --> 10:40.470
<i>It's "Back Talk" with Barry Simms.</i>

10:40.720 --> 10:41.760
<i>Who is that guy?</i>

10:41.970 --> 10:46.600
<i>We're in the second hour of a special Halloween</i>
<i>edition of "Back Talk". I'm Barry Simms.</i>

10:46.810 --> 10:48.730
<i>As usual, we're coming</i>
<i>to you live from</i>

10:48.940 --> 10:51.650
<i>high atop the Sears</i>
<i>Tower here in Chicago.</i>

10:51.810 --> 10:54.650
<i>Tomorrow night, we will be</i>
<i>coming to you from Haddonfield,</i>

10:54.860 --> 10:58.570
<i>the town that has banned</i>
<i>Halloween since 1989,</i>

10:58.780 --> 11:01.280
<i>when infamous serial killer Michael Myers,</i>

11:01.490 --> 11:05.950
<i>his niece, Jamie Lloyd, and about a</i>
<i>dozen cops were killed in an explosion.</i>

11:06.160 --> 11:07.330
<i>We have a caller waiting.</i>

11:07.540 --> 11:09.250
<i>Who's next to talk to me?</i>

11:09.920 --> 11:12.590
<i>I... I know this may sound crazy, Barry, but...</i>

11:12.790 --> 11:14.630
<i>I really think I'm in love with him.</i>

11:14.840 --> 11:18.170
<i>He's so untamed, so uninhibited.</i>

11:18.420 --> 11:20.840
<i>He's everything I've ever wanted in a man.</i>

11:22.090 --> 11:24.350
<i>You know, this is good.</i>
<i>I can see the tabloids now.</i>

11:24.560 --> 11:28.350
<i>"Psycho Lays Nympho:</i>
<i>The Best Sex He Ever Dismembers"</i>

11:28.560 --> 11:32.020
<i>Is this the type that you always fall for, lady?</i>
<i>Any other serial studs on the list?</i>

11:32.190 --> 11:33.480
<i>You know, Bundy, Manson?</i>

11:33.650 --> 11:35.360
<i>What about that Dahmer guy? I bet...</i>

11:35.570 --> 11:39.150
<i>- I bet you could really cook with him.</i>
<i>- No, I just want Michael.</i>

11:39.320 --> 11:43.030
<i>I... I wanna know what's behind that mask.</i>

11:43.240 --> 11:46.370
<i>Deep down, I think he's</i>
<i>just like you and me, Barry.</i>

11:46.580 --> 11:48.790
He just needs someone
to understand him.

11:48.950 --> 11:52.250
<i>- Someone to love him.</i>
<i>- Yeah, deep down I'm sure that's true.</i>

11:52.460 --> 11:56.630
<i>You're talking about one of this</i>
<i>nation's most notorious serial killers</i>

11:56.840 --> 11:58.710
<i>like he belongs in some</i>
<i>kind of sex seminar.</i>

11:58.920 --> 12:01.640
<i>You know, I hate to be the one</i>
<i>to break the news to you, lady,</i>

12:01.740 --> 12:04.430
<i>but Michael Myers has</i>
<i>been dead for six years.</i>

12:19.650 --> 12:20.650
<i>Now...</i>

12:20.820 --> 12:24.660
<i>we've got someone who actually</i>
<i>claims to have seen that Michael Myers.</i>

12:25.780 --> 12:28.700
<i>- Does this wacko caller have a name?</i>
<i>- My name's Tommy.</i>

12:29.540 --> 12:31.870
I was only eight years old, when I saw him.

12:32.290 --> 12:34.170
But I was one of the lucky ones.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.170
I survived.

12:37.420 --> 12:39.760
<i>There is help out there</i>
<i>for people like you.</i>

12:41.010 --> 12:42.510
<i>It's called electro-shock therapy!</i>

12:42.610 --> 12:45.970
<i>Come on. You don't really believe</i>
<i>that Michael Myers is actually alive.</i>

12:46.180 --> 12:49.100
Michael's work isn't done in Haddonfield.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.520
And soon...

12:51.020 --> 12:52.270
Very soon...

12:52.940 --> 12:54.100
He'll come home...

12:54.520 --> 12:55.770
To kill again.

12:56.940 --> 12:58.610
But this time I'll be ready.

12:58.820 --> 13:02.770
<i>Actually, Tom, I hear Smith's Grove is</i>
<i>having a blue light on Vicodin; check that out.</i>

13:02.870 --> 13:04.910
<i>The lines are open, so</i>
<i>give me your best shot</i>

13:05.200 --> 13:08.410
<i>at 1-800-968-7825.</i>

13:09.160 --> 13:10.790
<i>Now, Dwayne.</i>

13:11.160 --> 13:14.040
<i>What's on your feeble excuse</i>
<i>for a mind tonight, Dwayne?</i>

13:14.250 --> 13:17.630
<i>I'd just like to say that I listen</i>
<i>to your show every night, Barry.</i>

13:17.840 --> 13:21.010
<i>I think you're the best.</i>
<i>I can't tell you how excited we are</i>

13:21.210 --> 13:24.510
<i>that you'll be paying a little visit</i>
<i>to our little town tomorrow night.</i>

13:24.720 --> 13:26.750
<i>So do you have a point</i>
<i>to make here, Dwayne,</i>

13:26.850 --> 13:28.560
<i>or should I just keep</i>
<i>spanking the monkey?</i>

13:28.660 --> 13:30.810
<i>Barry, you're too much.</i>

13:31.020 --> 13:33.390
<i>I'd just like to say that I</i>
<i>understand how things</i>

13:33.600 --> 13:35.020
<i>have changed in the 90's.</i>

13:35.230 --> 13:36.440
<i>Gays in the military,</i>

13:36.650 --> 13:39.610
<i>cut off your husband's dick</i>
<i>and become a national hero.</i>

13:39.820 --> 13:42.800
<i>I just can't see any sense in</i>
<i>bringing Halloween back to Haddonfield.</i>

13:42.900 --> 13:46.530
<i>Wink, wink. Thank you, Dwayne.</i>
<i>You may leave me now.</i>

13:47.240 --> 13:48.240
<i>Next caller.</i>

13:48.410 --> 13:52.200
<i>I say it's about time they had</i>
<i>a Halloween revival in this town.</i>

13:52.410 --> 13:55.080
<i>Now my kids can</i>
<i>stop driving me crazy.</i>

13:55.290 --> 13:57.880
<i>That maniac's either</i>
<i>long dead or long gone.</i>

13:58.080 --> 14:02.000
<i>Either way, I say let's bury this</i>
<i>sucker and get the party started.</i>

14:02.210 --> 14:04.670
<i>Party, woo-hoo!</i>
<i>Beer! Yeah!</i>

14:04.880 --> 14:05.880
<i>Thank you, Ashley.</i>

14:06.010 --> 14:09.180
Barry, what happened to that
psychiatrist of his, Loomis?

14:09.350 --> 14:10.680
I heard the old quack was dead.

14:11.310 --> 14:16.850
Not dead. Just very much retired.

14:25.070 --> 14:30.160
- Good God. Terence. Come in.
- Christ, what a night.

14:30.410 --> 14:34.700
Not even so much as a sign
for five miles on that road!

14:34.910 --> 14:37.080
That's the beauty of the countryside.

14:37.790 --> 14:39.460
I thrive on it.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.840
- God, you look good, Sam.
- I feel great.

14:42.040 --> 14:45.210
I had surgery, plastic surgery.

14:45.420 --> 14:51.140
Skin grafts. It cost a fortune, but at
least I don't frighten people anymore.

14:51.350 --> 14:54.560
Don't tell me the revered
Rasputin of Smith's Grove

14:54.770 --> 14:56.850
has grown complacent
in his old age.

14:57.060 --> 14:58.850
Well, I won't believe
that for a second.

14:59.060 --> 15:03.690
Well, I can't remember you
making house calls, Dr. Wynn,

15:03.900 --> 15:05.690
especially at this hour.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.410
And you're right.
I've come to celebrate?

15:11.660 --> 15:13.580
Why are you listening to that jerk?

15:13.780 --> 15:17.870
Oh, it's a program about Haddonfield.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.870
I'm taping it.

15:38.600 --> 15:43.150
<i>So, who is responsible for getting</i>
<i>this Halloween rally thing together?</i>

15:43.360 --> 15:46.150
<i>We are, the students of</i>
<i>Haddonfield junior college.</i>

15:46.360 --> 15:49.450
<i>But why go to all the trouble</i>
<i>of throwing this soiree?</i>

15:49.650 --> 15:51.840
<i>So what if Halloween has</i>
<i>been banned in Haddonfield?</i>

15:51.940 --> 15:52.870
<i>Who gives a damn?</i>

15:53.070 --> 15:56.370
<i>We do! We live here.</i>
<i>I mean, it's time we got on with our lives.</i>

15:56.580 --> 15:58.870
<i>That's what tomorrow night is all about.</i>

15:59.080 --> 16:02.040
<i>- This town is dying, Barry.</i>
<i>- Wow.</i>

16:02.210 --> 16:06.420
<i>You know, I've heard Michael Myers blamed</i>
<i>for a lot of things tonight, but this is a first.</i>

16:06.630 --> 16:07.960
<i>He's actually killed the economy!</i>

16:08.210 --> 16:10.550
<i>Look, tomorrow night is</i>
<i>going to change all that,</i>

16:10.760 --> 16:13.430
<i>especially after you do your</i>
<i>broadcast live from campus.</i>

16:13.640 --> 16:16.760
<i>You have reached Haddonfield</i>
<i>Emergency Services.</i>

16:17.100 --> 16:20.640
<i>Due to severe weather conditions,</i>
<i>all circuits are momentarily busy.</i>

16:20.850 --> 16:22.560
<i>If this is not an emergency...</i>

16:22.810 --> 16:25.480
<i>You gonna get up there on the stage with old Bar'?</i>

16:25.810 --> 16:27.150
<i>- Uh, yeah, I will.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

16:27.360 --> 16:30.570
<i>Well, I'll see you tomorrow night.</i>
<i>This is "Back Talk" with Barry Simms.</i>

16:30.670 --> 16:38.040
<i>Give me a call at 1-800-968-7825.</i>
<i>That's 1-800-YOU-SUCK.</i>

16:38.240 --> 16:41.210
<i>So come on, all you</i>
<i>boogeyman believers out there.</i>

16:41.410 --> 16:42.750
<i>Give me a call.</i>

16:43.080 --> 16:44.330
<i>Call me tonight.</i>

16:47.750 --> 16:50.210
Well, after 32 years,

16:50.420 --> 16:52.630
guess who is finally
relinquishing his duties

16:52.840 --> 16:54.970
as chief administrator
of Smith's Grove?

16:55.180 --> 16:59.390
- Good god, you don't mean to say you're—
- Retiring!

16:59.600 --> 17:01.770
I came by to give you
the news myself.

17:01.980 --> 17:05.599
Well, I wish you well, Terence.

17:05.810 --> 17:08.270
It's been in the planning
stages for some time now.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.690
To old friends...

17:12.530 --> 17:13.569
To retirement...

17:14.240 --> 17:15.450
To new beginnings.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.069
Old friends.

17:23.790 --> 17:24.790
Sam...

17:25.000 --> 17:27.460
I want you to come back to Smith's Grove.

17:29.590 --> 17:35.090
You should know that it's not wise
to play Halloween pranks on me.

17:35.300 --> 17:39.890
It's no prank. You are the one I've chosen, Sam.
I want you to come back.

17:40.100 --> 17:44.270
After my stroke six years ago they
practically had to hold a pistol

17:44.480 --> 17:46.980
to my head to get me to retire, but...

17:47.190 --> 17:51.690
Things are different now.
I'm different.

17:52.030 --> 17:56.860
I've buried the ghosts.
I've buried them in this manuscript.

17:57.820 --> 18:00.490
I don't want to practice medicine anymore.

18:00.910 --> 18:04.000
<i>- They're coming! They're coming!</i>
<i>- Yeah. So they're coming, they're coming.</i>

18:04.200 --> 18:06.120
<i>Don't tell me, your name is Joan...</i>

18:06.330 --> 18:08.830
<i>Joan of Arc, and you're also</i>
<i>hearing voices, right?</i>

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
<i>Now, who's coming?</i>

18:13.590 --> 18:14.590
<i>It's Michael.</i>

18:14.880 --> 18:16.470
<i>Michael Myers.</i>

18:18.300 --> 18:19.340
<i>Look, someone, anyone...</i>

18:19.550 --> 18:21.220
<i>Help me. Dr. Loomis, are you out there?</i>

18:21.430 --> 18:25.270
<i>- Can you hear me? Dr. Loomis, I need your help.</i>
<i>- Please, please. No, no, stop. Stop that.</i>

18:25.370 --> 18:26.690
<i>What the hell is going on tonight?</i>

18:28.400 --> 18:32.150
<i>Every looney in the state is calling.</i>
<i>What is this? A full moon?</i>

18:32.400 --> 18:35.780
<i>Oh, man. I guess Halloween</i>
<i>brings out all the wackos.</i>

18:36.320 --> 18:38.780
<i>I can't wait until we get</i>
<i>to Haddonfield tomorrow.</i>

19:03.260 --> 19:05.660
Shhh. Shhhh.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.480
It's okay.

19:09.690 --> 19:13.290
Yes. It's alright.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.490
Shhh. Yes.

19:21.910 --> 19:22.990
It's okay.

20:52.370 --> 20:53.370
No!

21:02.720 --> 21:04.340
Leave us alone!

22:59.710 --> 23:01.540
You can't have the baby, Michael.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.250
You can't have the baby.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.330
Enough...

23:36.540 --> 23:38.160
of this Michael Myers...

23:39.370 --> 23:40.370
bullshit!

23:42.080 --> 23:46.130
Now, you stinking kids got about three
seconds to get the hell off my property!

23:46.340 --> 23:48.140
One!
Two!

24:29.460 --> 24:31.970
It was Jamie Lloyd.

24:32.180 --> 24:34.050
That was six years ago, Sam.

24:34.260 --> 24:36.390
You know she died with
him in that explosion.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.080
- You know it!
- That's what someone would like us to believe.

24:40.020 --> 24:48.360
But I tell you Michael is alive.
I can feel his evil heart beating,

24:48.650 --> 24:52.570
I can see him just as I
did all those years ago

24:52.780 --> 24:55.740
behind these very same walls.

24:55.950 --> 25:02.960
Staring, staring.
Always growing stronger.

25:04.620 --> 25:13.630
Please. As my colleague, as my
friend, I can't go through this again.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.640
Not alone.

25:15.800 --> 25:18.890
I need your help
to stop him.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.400
Dr. Wynn, I didn't
expect you in this morning.

25:29.360 --> 25:33.780
Donna, this is Dr. Loomis,
the man I was telling you about.

25:33.990 --> 25:36.530
Oh, yes. It's a pleasure
to meet you, doctor.

25:36.740 --> 25:38.900
It will be wonderful to
have you back at the hospital.

25:39.780 --> 25:41.870
Dr. Wynn, there's
something you should know.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.330
Donna, I'd like you to get
Dr. Loomis anything he needs.

25:44.540 --> 25:47.920
Files, tests, records of every
treatment we've ever administered

25:48.130 --> 25:51.250
to a former patient of
ours, Michael Myers.

25:51.760 --> 25:55.430
- Michael Myers?
- Is something wrong?

25:55.630 --> 25:58.600
I just received a phone call.
That girl Jamie Lloyd...

25:58.800 --> 26:01.010
Her body was found this
morning near Haddonfield.

26:04.390 --> 26:06.710
Notify the Haddonfield sheriff;
tell him we're on the way.

26:06.850 --> 26:08.480
I want the entire staff on alert.

26:08.690 --> 26:11.150
We go to code red lockdown
for twenty-four hours.

26:12.230 --> 26:14.360
If that maniac
is really out there...

26:14.570 --> 26:16.360
I plan to bring him back.

26:16.570 --> 26:17.770
Alive.

26:18.450 --> 26:20.240
Yo, G, wassup?!

26:21.410 --> 26:23.620
Barry's my
homeboy from Chicago.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.120
Yes, that Barry Simms.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.500
Beth and I are
down on this gig.

26:28.710 --> 26:29.910
Danny.

26:30.710 --> 26:34.300
Look, you just bring the posse
tonight, and we'll hook you up.

26:34.510 --> 26:35.510
Ace.

26:40.800 --> 26:44.180
Doesn't Danny look cute
dressed up as his Uncle Tim?

26:45.230 --> 26:48.560
Great. Now I've got a six-year-old
gang member for a son.

26:48.810 --> 26:49.810
Perfect.

26:50.730 --> 26:53.230
This is the famous Tim
Strode stomach pounder.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.900
- You down for the challenge?
- Hit me, G.

27:01.030 --> 27:02.240
Good try, Dan man.

27:02.450 --> 27:04.200
You better stick to orange juice.

27:04.740 --> 27:06.040
Shitheads.

27:06.370 --> 27:08.040
Defacing my property.

27:10.210 --> 27:12.250
- I showed them.
- John, they were just kids.

27:12.460 --> 27:14.920
Kids, my dear Deborah, are
what's ruining this country.

27:15.130 --> 27:18.760
Everywhere you go it's the same damn thing.
There's no goddamn respect.

27:21.010 --> 27:22.550
I rest my case.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.560
Kara, you'll never pass that
exam on an empty stomach.

27:30.310 --> 27:34.900
"Cognitive therapy and emotional disorders".
What are they teaching you in college these days?

27:35.110 --> 27:36.150
The art of going crazy?

27:36.360 --> 27:38.070
It's called psychology, mom.

27:38.610 --> 27:41.200
Living in this house is
enough to drive anyone crazy.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.340
Oh, yeah?

27:42.440 --> 27:45.200
Well, who the hell asked you to
come back here in the first place?

27:48.290 --> 27:49.710
I better get Danny to school.

27:49.910 --> 27:52.340
Doesn't show her face around
her own family for five years...

27:52.440 --> 27:55.000
then comes back and expects
us to roll out the red carpet.

27:55.210 --> 27:58.130
You think going to college is gonna
make up for your mistakes, girl?

27:58.340 --> 28:00.550
- John, please.
- Lay off her, dad.

28:01.890 --> 28:03.010
Let's go, Danny.

28:03.220 --> 28:07.220
Kara, wait, please. John, can't we just
sit down for once and try to be a family?

28:07.430 --> 28:08.560
Sorry, Mom.

28:11.100 --> 28:13.650
Oh, yeah, that's it, Deborah.
Just keep slipping her the cash.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.150
You know, while you're at it,
I got a great idea. Here.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.440
Why don't you give her
all of our goddamn money?

28:18.650 --> 28:20.360
Why don't you leave her alone?

28:20.900 --> 28:22.360
Nothing ever changes, does it?

28:22.570 --> 28:23.990
You've gotta wake up.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.780
I got news for you, girl.

28:26.530 --> 28:29.000
Before you came around,
everything was going fine.

28:29.160 --> 28:30.750
Until you landed on our doorstep.

28:31.580 --> 28:32.670
You and that little...

28:33.500 --> 28:35.040
bastard of yours.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.550
I see only one bastard in this house.

28:47.260 --> 28:48.770
Danny...

28:52.520 --> 28:53.650
Get away from her!

28:53.850 --> 28:55.360
- You shut up and stay outta this!

28:55.560 --> 28:57.440
- John, please, don't!
- Kill for him.

28:57.650 --> 29:02.200
You ever talk to me like that again
and so help me God...

29:02.820 --> 29:04.160
You understand?

29:27.390 --> 29:28.970
Give me the knife, Danny.

29:37.110 --> 29:38.110
Hey...

29:38.520 --> 29:42.530
Hey. Make way for the Hardin County Express.
Where's Tim?

29:42.740 --> 29:45.020
We're supposed to go over
the list of events for tonight.

29:45.570 --> 29:49.330
Oh, God.
Did he do that to you?

29:49.580 --> 29:53.040
Another episode of "Father
Knows Best" at the Strode house.

29:53.290 --> 29:55.460
What the hell happened this time?

29:57.580 --> 30:00.210
- What's gotten into you?
- Just glad to see you, that's all.

30:00.420 --> 30:01.460
You guys okay?

30:02.210 --> 30:05.720
Tonight's the night we bring
some life back into this town.

30:05.930 --> 30:09.350
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be
the ones to organize this friggin' fair?

30:09.550 --> 30:10.760
I mean, it's only Halloween.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.600
How many times do I have to tell you.
It's not about Halloween.

30:13.700 --> 30:16.810
Now, Danny, you know Grandpa
didn't really hurt me, right?

30:17.020 --> 30:18.020
Right, Mom.

30:19.770 --> 30:23.320
Well, you'd better
go catch your bus.

30:24.030 --> 30:26.360
But tonight when you come home
we'll go trick-or-treating, okay?

30:26.460 --> 30:27.240
Okay.

30:29.030 --> 30:31.660
- I love you, Danny.
- I love you, Mommy.

30:31.870 --> 30:33.450
Give me a squeeze.

30:43.170 --> 30:44.840
Yeah. Okay.

30:47.130 --> 30:49.760
I just can't live with her
anymore, Deborah.

30:50.470 --> 30:52.720
You don't understand, do you?

30:54.060 --> 30:56.680
It's not about Kara,
it's about you.

30:59.060 --> 31:01.730
I don't care what she's done;
she's your daughter.

31:03.690 --> 31:06.030
She's not my daughter anymore.

31:06.900 --> 31:09.360
Beth, who's that guy who
lives across the hall from you?

31:09.610 --> 31:11.200
Why, you interested?

31:11.530 --> 31:12.530
Yeah, right.

31:12.910 --> 31:14.870
He's always staring out his window.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.500
Last night, I caught him watching me.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.830
That must be Tommy.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.830
On a weirdness scale of one to ten,

31:20.040 --> 31:21.750
he rates about a 13.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.340
Supposedly some scary shit happened
to him, when he was a kid.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.010
Messed up his head pretty bad.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.420
He's harmless, though.

31:28.630 --> 31:30.720
- He's probably just lonely.
- Or horny.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.850
Something you probably haven't felt in a while.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.100
Tim...

31:34.890 --> 31:37.680
Happy Halloween, Mrs. Blankenship!

31:38.310 --> 31:42.190
Best part about living in that boarding house is
that crazy old lady wouldn't hear a truck

31:42.400 --> 31:43.600
drive through her living room.

31:44.020 --> 31:46.980
Please. Look, you've gotta listen to me!
They're coming! They're coming!

31:47.320 --> 31:50.780
Yeah, so they're coming, they're coming.
Don't tell me. Your name is Joan...

31:51.030 --> 31:53.570
Joan of Arc and you're also hearing voices, right?

31:55.330 --> 31:56.700
Come on. Now, who's coming?

31:58.200 --> 31:59.330
It's Michael.

31:59.540 --> 32:00.960
Michael Myers.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.420
Look, someone, anyone, help me.

32:04.630 --> 32:07.340
Dr. Loomis, are you out there?
Can you hear me, Dr. L...

32:12.890 --> 32:14.430
It's Michael.
Michael Myers.

32:14.640 --> 32:17.520
...your attention, please.
Bus 611 from Pontiac...

32:17.720 --> 32:20.640
Look, someone, anyone, help me.
Dr. Loomis, are you out there?

32:20.850 --> 32:22.690
Can you hear me, Dr. Loomis? I need your help.

32:22.850 --> 32:26.020
- God, please, help.
- May I have your attention, please?

32:26.230 --> 32:30.150
Bus 34 from Peoria, Russelville and Gardner...

32:30.360 --> 32:32.660
with through service to Chicago, Illinois...

32:32.860 --> 32:35.200
will be arriving in five minutes.

32:35.410 --> 32:40.330
Ticketed passengers, please wait inside
the door until arrival of bus number 34.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.960
Can I help you, sir?

32:52.720 --> 32:55.340
Can you tell me if a bus arrived
from Pontiac last night?

32:57.390 --> 32:58.390
Sure did.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.060
- Are you looking for someone?
- Thank you.

33:37.090 --> 33:38.890
May I have your attention, please?

33:39.100 --> 33:41.600
Bus number 34,
service to Chicago,

33:41.810 --> 33:45.270
has arrived and is now ready for
boarding through the side doors.

34:19.719 --> 34:20.850
Jesus.

34:26.770 --> 34:28.969
Shhh. Shhh.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.030
No. It's okay.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.570
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, man.

34:39.320 --> 34:41.739
It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

34:54.510 --> 34:56.760
Good God, what's that?

34:57.220 --> 34:59.220
It's... his mark.

35:00.390 --> 35:01.720
He's come home.

35:07.390 --> 35:09.190
Dear God.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.270
Jamie.

35:15.070 --> 35:17.280
Only God can help her now, sir.

35:17.490 --> 35:20.320
Sam, don't.
Let them take care of her.

35:20.490 --> 35:22.660
- Doctor Loomis.
- Yeah.

35:22.830 --> 35:24.620
They told me you'd be coming.

35:24.830 --> 35:28.370
Now I suggest you go right on
back to your crackpot asylum.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.170
You people got no
business in my town.

35:31.710 --> 35:34.630
Michael Myers is my business.

35:34.840 --> 35:38.260
It's been quiet here for six years
and that's the way it's gonna stay,

35:38.470 --> 35:42.050
and the last thing I need now is you
going around spouting off ghost stories.

35:42.260 --> 35:44.470
I suppose it was a ghost
that did all this, then.

35:44.680 --> 35:47.310
It was a ghost talking
on the radio last night.

35:47.520 --> 35:50.770
That's a ghost being
carried out of here right now?!

36:17.380 --> 36:18.760
Yo, check it out!

36:19.880 --> 36:21.260
Tonight's gonna be killer.

36:22.300 --> 36:25.510
Kara, I swear. One of these days,
you're gonna get lost in that thing.

36:25.720 --> 36:29.640
- I can't find my term paper.
- So copy someone else's. I do it all the time.

36:29.850 --> 36:31.060
Works primo.

36:31.730 --> 36:33.480
Oh, shit!

36:36.320 --> 36:40.360
Looks like your little boy has got
himself quite an imagination.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.070
He's been having nightmares.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.200
I think it's cool.

36:49.080 --> 36:52.540
- Must be some nightmares.
- Beth, we got work to do.

36:55.290 --> 36:56.290
Hey...

36:56.500 --> 36:57.960
Are you gonna be okay?

37:00.010 --> 37:01.010
"Thorn"?

37:55.390 --> 37:56.850
I need to see a doctor.

37:57.060 --> 37:59.480
- What seems to be the problem?
- Uh, it's my baby.

37:59.820 --> 38:00.940
There's been an accident.

38:01.150 --> 38:04.400
- What kind of accident?
- Get me a doctor! Now!

38:08.320 --> 38:09.370
Security?

38:09.580 --> 38:12.240
Sam, there's nothing you
can do for her now.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.170
Dr. Loomis?

38:19.710 --> 38:20.710
Yeah.

38:21.880 --> 38:23.170
Dr. Loomis...

38:23.800 --> 38:25.340
Thank God you're here.

38:26.260 --> 38:28.300
You heard her last night, didn't you?
It was Jamie.

38:29.220 --> 38:30.390
I'm sorry.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.770
- I don't know you, do I?
- I'm Tommy.

38:33.220 --> 38:34.480
Tommy Doyle.

38:35.850 --> 38:39.360
Laurie Strode, Jamie's mother, was
baby-sitting me the night when...

38:39.560 --> 38:40.820
Tommy Doyle.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.570
What're you doing here?

38:45.030 --> 38:46.200
Please...

38:46.610 --> 38:48.280
I need to know the truth.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.740
Michael Myers has come
home, hasn't he?

38:53.080 --> 38:55.250
What do you know
about Michael?

38:55.450 --> 38:57.670
I know he's still out there.

38:57.870 --> 39:00.070
People in this town,
they want us to believe he's dead,

39:00.170 --> 39:01.960
but I know.
I've always known.

39:02.170 --> 39:06.090
She's out there fighting for her life.
If she should die...

39:07.590 --> 39:11.350
- She is the last of his bloodline.
- No, Dr. Loomis.

39:12.010 --> 39:13.560
She's not the last.

39:15.720 --> 39:16.770
Oh, God.

39:17.100 --> 39:19.850
There's a family. Relatives of
the people who adopted Laurie:

39:20.060 --> 39:21.190
the Strodes.

39:21.810 --> 39:23.570
They're living in the Myers house.

39:24.820 --> 39:26.690
Dr. Loomis, about Michael...

39:27.030 --> 39:28.950
- It's just a theory of mine of...
- That's him.

39:31.320 --> 39:34.580
Meet me tonight.
9:00 at the campus rally.

39:34.830 --> 39:35.870
Tommy, wait!

39:36.040 --> 39:37.040
Wait!

39:38.500 --> 39:39.750
Tommy, wait!

39:40.790 --> 39:42.250
Oh, there you are.

39:42.460 --> 39:43.790
Who is that boy?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.260
An old friend.

41:15.720 --> 41:16.920
Great.

42:07.810 --> 42:10.980
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Strode.

42:11.730 --> 42:13.150
Is everything all right?

42:13.360 --> 42:14.650
Who are you?

42:14.860 --> 42:17.490
I came to help your family.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.020
Shh. Shh.

42:41.640 --> 42:43.640
It's okay.

42:43.930 --> 42:44.930
Okay.

42:46.270 --> 42:47.270
Steven.

42:48.350 --> 42:49.610
You like that name?

42:50.940 --> 42:52.520
Yeah, I think it suits you.

43:03.450 --> 43:06.500
It's okay. It's alright.

43:10.920 --> 43:13.000
I won't let anything happen to you.

43:16.260 --> 43:22.390
For 15 years I've been obsessed to find
out what was going on inside of him.

43:23.350 --> 43:27.680
It's been my life's work,
and my ultimate failure.

43:27.940 --> 43:34.190
This force, this thing that lived inside
of him came from a source too violent,

43:34.400 --> 43:37.110
too deadly for you to imagine. It...

43:37.570 --> 43:40.030
It grew inside him.

43:41.660 --> 43:43.830
Contaminating his soul.

43:45.290 --> 43:46.290
It was...

43:47.040 --> 43:48.580
pure evil.

43:49.540 --> 43:52.670
- What makes you think he'll come back here?
- This house...

43:52.880 --> 43:55.960
is sacred to him.
He has all his memories here.

43:56.170 --> 43:57.710
His rage!

43:59.420 --> 44:00.760
Mrs. Strode...

44:00.970 --> 44:01.940
I beg of you.

44:02.040 --> 44:07.520
Don't let your family suffer the same
fate that Laurie and her daughter suffered.

44:10.020 --> 44:13.270
- Jamie? I... I thought that she—
- She's been found.

44:13.480 --> 44:17.570
Outside Haddonfield, stabbed.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.870
What should I do?

44:25.080 --> 44:30.160
I really am sorry, but you haven't
a moment to lose, Mrs. Strode.

44:31.080 --> 44:35.920
Michael Myers has come
back to Haddonfield to kill.

44:40.420 --> 44:41.420
Strode Real Estate.

44:41.590 --> 44:43.890
John, something terrible's happened.

44:44.340 --> 44:45.720
What do you want now, Deborah?

44:46.140 --> 44:49.730
A man came by the house,
a psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.

44:50.930 --> 44:54.270
And he told me about the terrible things
that happened here in our house.

44:54.480 --> 44:57.590
Deborah, what the hell are you doing?
Talking to strangers, letting 'em in our house?

44:57.690 --> 45:00.780
John, they found Jamie Lloyd this morning.
Someone tried to kill her.

45:00.990 --> 45:03.080
Deborah, I don't know what
the hell you're talking about.

45:03.180 --> 45:05.910
You ought to stop watching
those damn TV talkshows.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.780
I'm getting the children out of here.

45:07.990 --> 45:10.080
At least until I know what's going on.

45:13.040 --> 45:14.880
John, I want you to come with us.

45:15.130 --> 45:17.000
You know. You know, Deborah.

45:17.250 --> 45:20.510
You've lost it. You know that, Deborah?
You've just lost it.

45:20.920 --> 45:23.010
The reason you moved us into this house...

45:23.930 --> 45:26.850
Your brother could never sell it
because of what happened here, could he?

45:28.350 --> 45:29.510
And you knew.

45:30.560 --> 45:32.390
And you didn't tell us, John.

45:33.060 --> 45:34.390
You knew.

45:35.350 --> 45:37.110
Goddamnit!

46:04.590 --> 46:06.390
Happy Halloween, little girl.

46:51.050 --> 46:52.000
Hello?

46:52.100 --> 46:53.890
We want the child.

46:54.270 --> 46:55.520
Who is this?

47:26.550 --> 47:27.720
Oh, Michael.

47:39.480 --> 47:42.580
<i>I'm coming.</i>

47:42.680 --> 47:44.020
Yeah, I'm...

47:44.650 --> 47:49.570
<i>Get ready, oh, yes! Yeah. Yes.</i>

47:49.780 --> 47:53.240
<i>I'm coming, all right, and you'd better</i>
<i>be there at the Halloween Harvest fair.</i>

47:53.450 --> 47:55.660
<i>Let's do it, together.</i>

48:14.850 --> 48:16.050
Sorry.

48:57.430 --> 48:59.720
Mom? I'm home!

49:01.640 --> 49:02.730
Hello?

49:05.560 --> 49:06.560
Mom!

50:10.550 --> 50:11.550
Mom?

50:32.150 --> 50:33.150
Mom?

50:34.860 --> 50:36.060
Danny?

50:57.930 --> 50:58.930
Mom?

51:00.050 --> 51:01.300
Are you there?

52:04.870 --> 52:06.490
What are you doing here?

52:13.250 --> 52:15.300
I'm your neighbor from across the street.

52:15.630 --> 52:18.510
- Tommy Doyle.
- What are you doing with my son?

52:18.840 --> 52:20.300
And... and where's my mother?

52:21.430 --> 52:23.800
She wasn't here... when Danny came home.

52:24.140 --> 52:25.470
Danny, go downstairs.

52:25.680 --> 52:28.890
But Tommy's my new friend.
He knows all about dinosaurs.

52:32.480 --> 52:35.110
You're in danger. Come with me.

52:48.620 --> 52:49.790
Hi, Mrs. B!

53:05.640 --> 53:08.520
You don't really expect us to stay here, do you?

53:08.850 --> 53:12.100
I want you to watch your house.
You can see everything from that window.

53:13.850 --> 53:15.480
Do you know how insane this is?

53:15.690 --> 53:17.230
Who am I supposed to be looking for?

53:18.150 --> 53:19.150
Him.

53:25.660 --> 53:27.330
Yeah. It's okay.

53:28.580 --> 53:29.580
It's okay, Steven.

53:39.340 --> 53:40.510
Mommy!

53:41.260 --> 53:42.260
Mom!

53:43.430 --> 53:44.720
Not now, Danny.

54:03.150 --> 54:04.150
Here you go.

54:05.860 --> 54:06.860
Come on.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.160
What?

54:14.750 --> 54:16.210
Here. Let me try.

54:19.250 --> 54:20.250
There.

54:22.840 --> 54:23.880
There.

54:26.550 --> 54:27.550
See?

54:28.850 --> 54:31.010
All it takes is a mother's touch.

55:36.790 --> 55:41.420
Uncle Michael, please don't hurt me.
Oh, God, please forget me.

56:00.140 --> 56:02.560
Your work is done now, Jamie.

56:09.110 --> 56:12.320
I let you down again, Jamie.

56:15.410 --> 56:17.790
I never should have left you.

56:20.540 --> 56:23.420
Runes were a kind of... early alphabet...

56:23.590 --> 56:27.170
that originated in Northern Europe about 500 B.C.

56:27.840 --> 56:33.220
They were symbols carved out
of stone or pieces of wood,

56:33.390 --> 56:37.310
used in pagan rituals to portend
future events and invoke magic.

56:38.850 --> 56:43.980
Of all the runes, Thorn had
the most negative influence.

56:45.190 --> 56:48.610
Among the ancient druids, Thorn
represented a demon that spread

56:48.820 --> 56:54.070
sickness, destroyed crops, and brought
death to hundreds of thousands of people.

56:54.320 --> 56:57.450
According to a Celtic legend,
one child from each tribe

56:57.660 --> 57:00.660
was chosen to be inflicted with a curse of Thorn.

57:00.870 --> 57:04.790
To offer the blood sacrifices of its
next of kin on the night of Samhain.

57:05.000 --> 57:05.990
Halloween.

57:06.090 --> 57:10.800
The sacrifice of one family meant
sparing the lives of an entire tribe.

57:11.010 --> 57:14.930
So why are you so concerned
about us if Michael's only out

57:15.140 --> 57:16.110
to kill his family?

57:16.210 --> 57:19.180
In his mind, anyone living
in his house is his family.

57:20.680 --> 57:23.440
For years I've been convinced
there must be some reason.

57:23.850 --> 57:26.310
Some method behind Michael's madness.

57:26.810 --> 57:29.030
And the common link I found is Thorn.

57:33.780 --> 57:36.620
The druids were also great
mathematicians and astronomers.

57:36.820 --> 57:39.580
The Thorn symbol is
actually constellation of stars

57:39.790 --> 57:42.210
that appears from time to
time on Halloween night.

57:44.040 --> 57:46.000
Whenever it appears, he appears.

57:47.840 --> 57:52.340
I've traced it back to 1963,
when Michael murdered his sister, Judith.

57:52.760 --> 57:55.890
The next time was in 1978; Michael
escapes from Smith's Grove.

57:56.090 --> 57:58.810
It happened a decade later,
and the year after that. He kills again.

57:59.600 --> 58:03.640
Now Jamie says Michael is back,
and for the first time in 6 years,

58:03.810 --> 58:05.810
Thorn reappears.
Coincidence?

58:07.060 --> 58:11.400
What would happen if he succeeded,
if he killed the last member of his family?

58:13.780 --> 58:15.570
Well, Michael's power would end,

58:16.990 --> 58:19.530
and the curse would be
passed on to another child.

58:24.330 --> 58:25.920
I think that's why these people,

58:26.670 --> 58:29.000
whoever they are,
are after Jamie's baby.

58:30.750 --> 58:33.010
To make it Michael's final sacrifice.

58:41.560 --> 58:42.640
Where are you going?

58:43.560 --> 58:46.060
To find the only man who can
stop him before it's too late.

58:46.270 --> 58:47.440
Oh, no. Where's Danny?

58:50.060 --> 58:51.060
Danny?

58:51.360 --> 58:52.180
Danny!

58:52.280 --> 58:53.440
Mrs. Blankenship!

58:54.360 --> 58:55.330
Have you seen...

58:55.430 --> 58:58.610
Danny, don't ever walk off without
telling me where you're going!

58:58.820 --> 59:00.160
Take him upstairs.

59:00.370 --> 59:02.410
Lock the door and wait till I get back.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.240
Kara...

59:04.660 --> 59:05.710
Whatever you do...

59:07.460 --> 59:09.130
Don't go back to your house.

59:14.510 --> 59:17.380
You let him get to her!
How could you?

59:17.590 --> 59:21.930
Dr. Loomis, during surgery we discovered
that Jamie's uterus was hemorrhaging,

59:22.140 --> 59:23.930
and we found this.

59:26.180 --> 59:27.940
It's placental fluid.

59:28.140 --> 59:31.190
Good God in heaven, do you mean to say—

59:31.360 --> 59:34.150
I estimate she gave birth
no more than 24 hours ago.

59:35.490 --> 59:37.650
Then the question is:
Where is the baby?

59:38.780 --> 59:42.030
I think I...
I may already know.

59:59.180 --> 01:00:01.720
Do you know why we celebrate Halloween?

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:05.140
Because that's when we go
trick-or-treating and get candy.

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:06.520
Oh, well...

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.140
Yes, but...

01:00:08.850 --> 01:00:11.230
A long, long time ago,

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:17.150
it was a night of great power,
when the days grew short

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:19.530
and the spirits of the dead

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:25.240
returned to their homes to
warm themselves by the fireside.

01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:30.620
All across the land huge bonfires were lit.

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:34.290
Oh, there was a marvelous celebration.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:37.800
People danced and they played games.

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:40.680
And they dressed up in costumes.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.930
Hoping to ward off the evil spirits.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:49.520
Especially the boogeyman.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.940
What's the boogeyman?

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.690
Come on, Danny.
Say good night to Mrs. Blankenship.

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:59.110
- Good night, Mrs. Blankenship.
- He hears the voice, you know.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:02.450
Just like the other boy that lived in that house.

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:06.700
What are you talking about?

01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:09.080
I was baby-sitting with him that night.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:12.210
Little Mikey Myers that lived across the street.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:17.460
And that's when the voice came,
the night he murdered his sister.

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:19.300
Michael heard a voice?

01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:23.430
It told him to kill his family.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:37.650
- Where the hell's Barry? Let's go!
- Don't get star-struck on me now.

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:43.150
We got a real agenda here, and Barry
is gonna help us get the message out.

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.700
Hey, look...

01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:00.940
Helloooo, Haddonfield!

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:08.890
- Barry!
- WKNB presents "Back Talk" with Barry Simms.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.390
- live from Haddonfield, Illinois,
- Barry!

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.640
the home of Michael Myers!

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.150
Deborah!

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:26.450
I'm home!

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.530
Thanks for the dinner.

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:40.380
Come out, come out...

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:41.800
Wherever you are.

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:53.140
Goddamnit.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:55.640
She actually left.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.940
I know what's going on.

01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:10.320
It must be the boogeyman.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.410
Here I come, boogeyman.

01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:15.290
'Cause, you know, I am really scared.

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:48.820
What the hell?

01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:51.320
The power's off.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.080
Tell me, kids, how's it feel to...

01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:30.170
finally pull Halloween out of
the proverbial Haddonfield closet?

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:31.760
What we're saying here is...

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:36.100
we will no longer let the powers
that be control our minds.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.470
For years...

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.230
Halloween has represented everything
that's wrong with Haddonfield.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.810
But Michael Myers is long gone.

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:47.110
There is NO boogeyman!

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:48.310
Whoa!

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.690
Does she get this riled up in the sack, Tim?

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:55.610
I bet she wears crotchless
panties and barks like a dog.

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:56.820
Beth...

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.580
What do you say, honey?
You and me, uh...

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.500
As I was saying...

01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:05.790
We have to stop acting out of fear.

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.290
Just look at Tim's family.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.090
They live in the Myers house.

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:13.720
You do?

01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:15.260
We do?

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:18.220
Uh... yeah, we do.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:20.220
Great house.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.310
- Strong wood.
- I see. You mean to tell me you actually live...

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.770
in the house...

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:28.810
of the most brutal
mass murderer in history?

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.610
This is the Barry Simms show.

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:35.530
And when we return...

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:37.780
we'll be coming at you live...

01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.990
from the one...

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.120
the only...

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:42.910
Myers house.
How's that for a Halloween shock-fest?

01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:46.490
How far to your house, kid?

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.670
About half a mile, but I don't know if my folks...

01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:50.190
Good, I'll meet you
there in five.

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.720
What about the kids?
We're supposed to throw all the candy.

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.730
Phone!

01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:55.260
Relax your crack, sweetheart.

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:58.390
Quick tootle around the old household
and we'll be right on back.

01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:03.220
Pull the van out back, so that I can
sneak out of here nice and quietly.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:06.730
Oh, no. No, no, really, really.
You're too good to me. Really.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.770
No. Thanks for putting me in the middle of this
cheap-shit country bumpkin outfit, Paul.

01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:11.980
I really appreciate it!

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:13.980
My fans expect better than this.

01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:17.860
No, no. Look, you tell that penny-pinching whiner
Mike Sarducci that when I get back,

01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:21.330
I am personally gonna cut off his
balls and wear 'em as earrings.

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:24.450
Where's the goddamn van?
God!

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:28.370
Oh, no, I'm trotting out for a cheeseburger.
I'm taking the show to the real Myers house,

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:30.500
where we should have
done it in the first place.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.180
Ten minutes in that house and I'll have
every fruitcake medium in the country

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:41.970
calling in trying to channel the
spirit of that pussy Michael Myers.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.770
Sure, we can do another show about him.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.810
Kick the audience in the face enough
and they'll lick you all over.

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:52.570
I'll call you when I get back, Paul. Bye-bye.

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.360
Where the f...

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.020
What happened to the lights?

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.520
Do you really think Barry's gonna show up?

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.899
Let's hope not.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.899
I'm sorry he turned out
to be such an asshole.

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:39.240
It's okay.

01:08:40.109 --> 01:08:41.700
Where is everyone?

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:42.910
Mom?

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:44.189
Kara?

01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:45.830
They're probably at the fair,

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.750
which is where we should be.

01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:48.950
Beth...

01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:53.210
What you said before about
Michael Myers living in our house.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.290
Is that really true?

01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.380
It was a cold Halloween night.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.720
He stood in the shadows,
watching through the windows...

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.260
as his sister and her boyfriend made love.

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.890
Then he crept inside...

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.810
picked up a huge butcher knife...

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.810
and made his way up these stairs.

01:09:13.979 --> 01:09:15.810
He raised the knife up behind her...

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:17.939
She turned around...

01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:19.359
and he stabbed her!

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.069
Cut it out, Beth!

01:09:24.569 --> 01:09:27.620
I really didn't know that Michael
Myers lived in my house, okay?

01:09:28.450 --> 01:09:29.450
It freaks me out.

01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:31.950
I'm sorry.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.710
I was just fooling around.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.040
It's okay.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.930
Let's get the candles.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.010
Just a minute.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:59.230
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:02.860
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:06.950
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:09.740
Mommy, it's raining red.

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:14.040
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:17.710
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:21.670
Mommy, it's raining.
It's raining red.

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:24.760
Mommy, it's raining red.

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:28.640
It's warm.

01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:31.270
Why is it warm?

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:56.920
Dr. Loomis.

01:10:58.170 --> 01:10:59.210
It's happening.

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:09.140
Your sister would kill us if she
knew we did it in her bed.

01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:11.640
Hey, that was your idea.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.430
I am bad, aren't I?

01:11:15.890 --> 01:11:19.230
Only when you wear crotchless
panties and bark like a dog.

01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:27.610
Where are you going?

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:29.160
I gotta take a shower.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:31.990
You know, to stay fresh.

01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:41.340
Watch out for the boogeyman.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.740
Hey, Beth, can you bring a
towel in here? I'm freezing.

01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:13.530
Where are you when I need you, honey?

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.540
Thanks.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:24.840
I'll be in in a minute.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.280
Mommy?

01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:55.030
Hold on a second, Danny.

01:12:57.450 --> 01:13:00.500
<i>Danny... Come to me...</i>

01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:04.500
- Hello?
- Mom? Wait, who is this?

01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:05.840
No, this is Beth.

01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:07.880
What are you doing there?

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:10.880
- Do you know where my mother is?
- She's not home. No one is.

01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:12.080
What's wrong?

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:13.510
Is Tim with you?

01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:15.220
He's in the shower.

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:18.350
I'm across the street.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.850
I can see you.

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:21.600
Beth, I want you to listen to me.

01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:24.020
Get Tim and get out of that house.
Right now.

01:13:24.230 --> 01:13:25.810
Carol, what the hell is going on?

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:29.230
Beth, look out! There's someone in the room.
He's right behind you!

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:47.380
No!

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.380
No!

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.140
Danny, no!

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:56.800
Danny!

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:02.310
Danny.

01:15:57.630 --> 01:15:58.630
Danny?

01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:10.140
Danny?

01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:12.350
Danny.

01:16:12.730 --> 01:16:13.900
Mommy?

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.440
It's okay.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.610
Danny, run!

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:06.260
Danny.

01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:08.220
Come to mommy.

01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:13.100
Danny, please.

01:19:01.650 --> 01:19:02.560
The baby.

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:03.690
Where's the baby?

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:04.790
Please!

01:19:04.890 --> 01:19:06.240
Open the door!

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:07.590
Please!

01:19:07.690 --> 01:19:10.410
Open the door!
Someone help us!

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:14.960
Please, somebody help us!

01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:18.710
Help us, please!

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:21.880
Help us, please!

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:28.970
Get 'em upstairs!

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:30.130
Now!

01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:31.220
Where's the baby?

01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:32.600
He's gone.

01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:35.060
Who else knew I had the baby?

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:36.520
- No one.
- No!

01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:38.560
There had to be someone else...

01:19:38.770 --> 01:19:42.400
- Who knew?
- Nobody knew except me and...

01:19:42.610 --> 01:19:44.820
<i>Danny. Come to me.</i>

01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:52.740
<i>Danny. Come to me.</i>

01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:59.170
<i>Come Danny, come to me.</i>

01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:08.420
Danny, no.

01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:11.430
No.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.640
Please.

01:20:16.930 --> 01:20:18.310
Careful with the girl.

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.060
Kara!

01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:23.270
Wynn.

01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:32.740
Mrs. Blankenship!
Oh, God, hurry! We have to...

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.370
Hello, dear.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.040
Where is she?

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:21.370
Where's Kara?

01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:24.880
I feel like I've been drugged.

01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:26.460
We have been drugged.

01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:27.880
Why are they doing this?

01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:30.300
Why didn't they just kill us?

01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:32.880
It's his game.

01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:37.220
And I know where he wants to play it.

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:08.380
- Dr. Loomis, you know that can't stop Michael.
- Nothing will stop Michael.

01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:10.340
But...

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:11.760
Wynn.

01:22:14.050 --> 01:22:15.840
I tried to tell you
in the hospital.

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:20.470
I think Michael is under the
influence of an evil rune.

01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:22.550
Thorn.

01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:29.650
I saw the symbol marked up
where we found Jamie stabbed.

01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:32.530
Well, there are runes of light... Protection.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:37.660
If Thorn could somehow be trapped by these
runes the energies could cancel themselves out.

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:39.580
The evil could be destroyed.

01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:43.160
You wait here.

01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:45.500
Don't go anywhere until I come back.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:47.920
Wynn.

01:22:57.430 --> 01:23:00.180
About time, Dr. Loomis.

01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:03.390
Welcome to your fate.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.310
The time has come for
you to know the truth.

01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:10.940
The time has come
for you to join us.

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.040
Why now?

01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:18.260
After Jamie escaped last night,
I knew that she would come to you,

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.330
and I knew that you would
lead us to her baby.

01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:24.660
Her very special baby.

01:23:25.410 --> 01:23:29.830
I needed her, just as I need you now.

01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:34.880
It's your destiny, Sam.
It lives inside you.

01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:37.840
It always has.
You know that, don't you?

01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:39.130
You...

01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:42.260
are...

01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:44.770
a madman.

01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:35.320
<i>Look around you, Sam.</i>

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.570
Madness everywhere.

01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:42.870
Famine, war, a great plague.

01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:49.410
These are signs that we must restore
balance to the natural order of things.

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:53.920
- We merely provide the means.
- Michael?

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:59.050
We've given him the power.
The gift of Thorn.

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:04.760
I am its deliverer. I follow it,
act as its guardian.

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:08.390
I protect Michael, watch over him.

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:13.520
And now it's time for another.

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:16.650
Now it's time for you....

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:18.650
Dr. Loomis.

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:24.030
I thought Michael was a monster.

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:25.870
But you...

01:25:38.210 --> 01:25:39.460
Leave him there.

01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.130
It's his office now.

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:13.460
Spirits and powers of the flame.

01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:18.540
Attend and witness this ritual.

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.420
Bear our gifts to Thorn.

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:28.810
Open us to the path of darkness.

01:26:32.890 --> 01:26:35.900
By these runes transform us.

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:43.110
Let the hammer descend on the chosen
one to whom we offer this sacrifice

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.110
of innocent blood.

01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:55.460
And then, Danny,
your journey begins.

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:58.000
Kill for him.

01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:00.590
No.

01:27:02.130 --> 01:27:06.010
Michael, your final sacrifice.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:11.060
Michael, you can make him stop it.

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:16.020
Don't kill the baby.
You can stop it.

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:22.400
You know whose baby it is, don't you?

01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:25.650
- Michael!
- The baby is yours, isn't it?

01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:27.740
Isn't it, Michael?

01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:31.160
Back off!

01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:35.460
- Untie her.
- Do as he says. Do it!

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.420
You should join us, you have talent.

01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:40.840
Shut up.

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.800
Danny, come on.

01:27:44.010 --> 01:27:46.630
Go! Okay? Let's go.

01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.100
Run!

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:03.980
Go!

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.690
Go, go!

01:28:28.930 --> 01:28:30.720
Move it! Go, go!

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.600
Shit!

01:28:37.810 --> 01:28:41.400
- Come on!
- It's not working.

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.730
Come on. It's not working!

01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:46.230
It's not...

01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:04.040
Back up from the gates!

01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:11.050
Get 'em out of here!

01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:17.010
Get in there!
Go on, get in!

01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:21.050
Mommy!

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:37.340
Samhain.

01:29:59.470 --> 01:30:01.350
Tommy! Where is he?

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.440
It worked.
The power of the runes stopped him.

01:30:07.690 --> 01:30:08.980
Michael.

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:13.490
What have they done to you?

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:33.340
- Where do we go now?
- As far away from Haddonfield as possible.

01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:39.720
- Come with us.
- No, I have a little business to attend to here.

01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:13.840
Michael.

01:31:20.970 --> 01:31:22.310
Michael.

01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:25.640
It's all over.

01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:27.650
It's all over!

01:31:30.690 --> 01:31:32.820
It's all over now.

01:31:41.410 --> 01:31:42.450
Michael.

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.040
Michael's gone.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:50.080
It's your game now, Dr. Loomis.
