01:32.635 --> 01:33.887
REBECCA: <i>Did I say, "Geneva"?</i>

01:33.970 --> 01:36.181
No, but Matt typed it in his notes just now.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.932
Mark. And he's right, I did.

01:38.016 --> 01:40.852
- How did you know that?
- Well...

01:40.935 --> 01:43.688
I don't like to talk about it, but I know things.

01:43.772 --> 01:45.398
Ever since I was a boy.

01:45.482 --> 01:47.650

but it's really more of a burden.

01:50.361 --> 01:52.197
He typed "Geneva." We work in television.

- You work in television.

01:54.324 --> 01:56.284
- I'm a litigator at Lowell Tiller.
- Genuflect when you say that.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.619
And there are a lot of reasons
we can't have jokes.

01:57.702 --> 01:59.370
Should I list them?

01:59.454 --> 02:01.748
You went on the air with a story
that alleged the US used nerve gas...

02:01.831 --> 02:02.957
WILL: It was a mistake.

02:03.041 --> 02:04.959
- ...during an operation, which is a war crime...
- On the enemy.

02:05.043 --> 02:06.211
We had two eyewitnesses
and a three-star general.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.463
...and a doctored interview
and a producer who says that <i>News Night</i>

02:08.546 --> 02:10.089
- conspired with the Pentagon...
- That's why we fired him.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.174
- ...to cover up Operation Geneva.
- Genoa.

02:11.257 --> 02:12.884
Fuck me!

02:14.969 --> 02:16.429
Well?

02:16.513 --> 02:19.432
Would one of you fuck Miss Halliday, please?

02:21.059 --> 02:23.561
- That was a little funny.
- Finally.

02:23.645 --> 02:26.648
Did you take calls from the DOD
asking you not to run the story?

02:26.731 --> 02:28.149
That happens all the time.

02:28.233 --> 02:30.443
The entire population
of the Pensacola Minimum Security Prison

02:30.527 --> 02:32.612
is people who did things
that happen all the time.

02:32.695 --> 02:34.781
- We ran the story.
- Then you retracted it?

02:34.864 --> 02:37.200
- Of course we retracted it.
- At the urging of the DOD?

02:37.283 --> 02:39.244
- Absolutely not.
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

02:39.327 --> 02:41.371

- Come on in.

02:41.454 --> 02:43.706
Maggie Jordan,
this is Rebecca Halliday, our lawyer.

02:43.790 --> 02:46.251
These are her associates Bob, Tom and Curt.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.335
- Ross Kessler.
- Mark Gage.

02:47.418 --> 02:49.003
- Ken Weinraub.
- What do you got?

02:49.087 --> 02:51.631
Looks like Romney's
gonna add an event in Charlotte at 8:00.

02:51.714 --> 02:52.924
He's gonna go on around 8:15.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.467
WILL: We'll cut in if he's saying something,

02:54.551 --> 02:56.511
- otherwise we'll stay with Sandy.
- Got it.

03:00.265 --> 03:02.225
Maggie Jordan is Margaret Jordan?

03:02.308 --> 03:03.768
- WILL: Yeah.
- What happened to her hair?

03:03.852 --> 03:06.688
- WILL: I don't know. Women try things.
- What the hell happened to her hair?

03:06.771 --> 03:10.400
Look, she went out on a story.
She went to Uganda.

03:10.483 --> 03:13.111
It got real very fast
and she came back a little messed up.

03:13.194 --> 03:16.531
Well, if this goes to the next level,
she better get un-messed up in a hurry

03:16.614 --> 03:18.032
because she's a character witness

03:18.116 --> 03:19.742
and she looks like
the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

03:19.826 --> 03:21.744
Counsel, if what happened to her
happened to you,

03:21.828 --> 03:23.371
you'd kill yourself for the rest of your life.

03:23.454 --> 03:26.749
You would sit in the middle of a room
and cry forever.

03:26.833 --> 03:29.711
A year ago, she looked like this.

03:29.794 --> 03:32.463
Now she looks like that.
What happened to her in Africa?

03:32.547 --> 03:34.048
- It doesn't matter.
- Can I decide that?

03:34.132 --> 03:36.551
- I'm her lawyer.
- I'm her lawyer.

03:36.634 --> 03:38.261
And your lawyer. And MacKenzie's.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.388
And everybody's.
And if you don't let me do my job...

03:40.471 --> 03:43.224
You're gonna do what? Jump up
really high in the air and swat my chin?

03:43.308 --> 03:44.601
I have the confidence of a tall man.

03:45.310 --> 03:46.644
Lose.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.564
I was going to say, "lose."

03:49.647 --> 03:53.651
And no one responsible for Genoa
will ever work again,

03:53.735 --> 03:56.821
including, and especially, the anchor
and executive producer of the broadcast.

03:57.447 --> 03:59.824
- If Jim Harper hadn't gone to...
- No.

03:59.908 --> 04:01.284
Let me finish the question.

04:01.367 --> 04:02.911
We don't have that kind of time.

04:02.994 --> 04:06.080
No, if Jim hadn't gone to New Hampshire,
if Dantana hadn't come up to cover for him,

04:06.164 --> 04:08.166
if West hadn't been on the drone panel,

04:08.249 --> 04:12.128

in just the right order,

04:12.211 --> 04:14.005
we wouldn't be sitting here.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.300
Fourteen months ago, you went on the air

04:17.383 --> 04:19.385
and called the Tea Party
"the American Taliban."

04:19.469 --> 04:20.595
- I did.
- And?

04:20.678 --> 04:21.971
The Taliban resented it.

"the American Taliban."

04:32.357 --> 04:33.358
Yeah.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.651
What happened then?

04:34.734 --> 04:36.945
- A lot.
- For starters?

04:38.529 --> 04:41.699
The president of AWM
got kicked out of the Capitol Building.

I couldn't get a cab.

- Lansing. Reese Lansing.

This is a Judiciary...
Yeah, I see people I know there.

It's okay. I'm the president of AWM.

05:30.623 --> 05:32.500
I can't let you in without ID.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.335
- Who do I speak to?
- About what?

05:34.419 --> 05:37.505
- About getting in the door?
- Me.

05:37.588 --> 05:40.883
I honestly don't mean to be rude,
but you're the man with the clipboard,

05:40.967 --> 05:42.885
and I need to speak to
the chairman or ranking member

05:42.969 --> 05:44.429
of the House Judiciary Committee.

05:44.637 --> 05:46.639
And what's standing
in between you and doing that?

05:46.723 --> 05:47.932
You.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.898
Okay.

06:01.696 --> 06:04.198
It wasn't an oversight. It was deliberate.

06:04.282 --> 06:06.701
- Those two words are antonyms.
- Are you telling me...

06:06.784 --> 06:08.911
Who'd have thought that
calling Tea Party congressmen

06:08.995 --> 06:10.705
"the American Taliban"
would have consequences?

06:10.788 --> 06:11.789
Are you saying...

06:11.873 --> 06:13.207
There was absolutely
no way to see this coming.

06:13.291 --> 06:16.127
The consequence was
that you were left off of a guest list.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.713
For SOPA! Not the Met Gala.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.965

when we called them "the American Taliban,"

06:21.049 --> 06:22.800
- they minded.
- Stop.

06:22.884 --> 06:25.511
Are you telling me AWM
was left out of a meeting

06:25.595 --> 06:28.890

because of the show last week?

06:28.973 --> 06:30.433
Oh, don't be silly.

06:30.516 --> 06:33.978
Wait. Yes, that is exactly
what we're telling you.

06:34.062 --> 06:36.522
Do you know how much we lose
every year to piracy?

06:36.606 --> 06:38.441
- No.
- No, me neither.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.693
It could be 10 billion. Could be 100 billion.

06:40.777 --> 06:42.445
- Let's just assume it's 10 billion.
- Okay.

06:42.528 --> 06:44.530
I want the 10 billion!

06:44.614 --> 06:46.282
We own intellectual property,

06:46.365 --> 06:49.077
and I want the fucking pajama people
to stop stealing it.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.244
Let's try to get to the bottom of exactly

06:50.328 --> 06:52.580
why they minded being called
"the American Taliban,"

06:52.663 --> 06:54.332
'cause I don't get it.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.751
- Is your suit mildewing?
- Yes, it is.

06:56.834 --> 06:59.212
AWM doesn't just create content.

06:59.295 --> 07:02.256
We own the physical lines
and ISPs that bring it to you.

07:02.340 --> 07:03.758

just for pointing you

07:03.841 --> 07:05.593

- Doesn't that screw you on both ends?
- Yeah.

That's sort of why we wanted
to help write the law.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.683
But three members of the Judiciary Committee

07:12.767 --> 07:14.644
ran and won with Tea Party support.

07:14.727 --> 07:17.271
- And kicked AWM out of the country?
- Yep.

07:17.355 --> 07:19.357

the Taliban comparison

07:19.440 --> 07:23.694

insult or whatever.

You're gonna come back
with only one camera.

- He broke his ankle in two places.

we've got the draft in 10 minutes.

And on that day, sir,
I will dance upon your grave.

13:22.928 --> 13:25.014

13:25.097 --> 13:26.765
How much time do I have
to formulate a comeback?

13:26.849 --> 13:28.851
That was it. The first thing
out of your mouth is the comeback.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.978
You wasted yours
on a question about comebacks.

- Your parents must be proud.
- They are.

13:36.609 --> 13:38.611
- I was elected unanimously.
- You were unopposed.

13:38.694 --> 13:40.821
Just like when you were
elected class treasurer.

13:40.905 --> 13:42.448
- That was an important job.
- It wasn't.

13:42.531 --> 13:43.782
Why does it have to be like this?

13:43.866 --> 13:45.159
Because you're a nerd and I'm a nerd,

13:45.242 --> 13:46.660
and you make nerds look bad.

13:46.744 --> 13:48.204
No, I make nerds look good.

13:48.287 --> 13:49.914
I've been meaning to tell you
you've been doing

13:49.997 --> 13:53.042
a perfectly adequate job
filling in for Elliot this week.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.377
There's a wire report
about a drone strike in the FATA

13:55.461 --> 13:57.338
- that killed five suspected militants.
- Excellent.

13:57.421 --> 14:00.090
- You heard me say "suspected," right?
- Talk to your EP.

14:00.925 --> 14:02.676
- Mac.
- Just a minute.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.303
Ben Furusho broke his ankle.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.971
- Is he all right?
- No, he's an idiot.

14:06.055 --> 14:08.182
But let me know who to put
on the Romney bus for a couple of weeks.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.643

- Is your cousin...
- Crazy?

14:13.145 --> 14:14.271
- Yeah.
- She is.

14:14.355 --> 14:17.066
- She's spamming me to death.
- Why'd you give her your email?

14:17.149 --> 14:18.692
She asked for it,
and I thought it would please you.

14:18.776 --> 14:20.277
Everything I do, I do to please you.

14:20.361 --> 14:21.946
- She's crazy.
- Thanks for the heads up.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.532
So what do you want to do tonight?

14:24.615 --> 14:26.283
What would please you?

14:26.367 --> 14:28.077
Romantic drink? Dancing?

14:28.160 --> 14:30.079
- Romantic bowling?
- What does that look like?

14:30.162 --> 14:31.664
It looks a lot like regular bowling.

14:31.747 --> 14:33.791
- Walk through the park?
- A romantic mugging.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.210
- I know how to defend myself.
- Do you know how to defend me?

14:36.293 --> 14:38.379
- I shout "Run!" really loud.
- (LAUGHS)

14:38.462 --> 14:40.297
- I'll see you at home.
- Perfect.

14:40.381 --> 14:42.508
- Have a good show.
- Not a chance.

14:55.980 --> 14:57.565
- Excuse me.
- He'll be out in a minute.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.483

- Do I know you?

14:59.567 --> 15:00.859
I'm Jenna Johnson.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.194
- You look familiar.
- I just started as an intern.

15:02.278 --> 15:04.697
Say, "Why is America
the greatest country in the world?"

15:05.573 --> 15:07.783
- Why is America the greatest...
- You're the sorority girl!

15:07.866 --> 15:09.785
- That's what I'm most famous for.
- You hired her?

15:09.868 --> 15:10.911
I'm benevolent.

15:10.995 --> 15:13.872
There are eight Broadway musicals
that have won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.208

I need you to name them, the composer,

15:16.292 --> 15:19.086
lyricist, librettist and source material, if any.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.754
- I need your...
- Go.

15:20.838 --> 15:23.591
You make the interns learn
musical theater history?

15:23.674 --> 15:25.092
You're welcome, America.

15:26.427 --> 15:27.720
Gaddafi's done.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.847
Hmm. Things you thought you'd never see.

15:29.930 --> 15:33.058
I want to talk to you about
the 9/11 anniversary coverage.

15:33.517 --> 15:37.646
I like how it's coming along so far.
It has a good tone. It looks up.

15:37.730 --> 15:40.399
I'm gonna pull you from the coverage.

15:41.191 --> 15:44.153
Elliot and Sloan will co-anchor in primetime.

15:46.697 --> 15:47.781
Because Reese got kicked out?

15:47.865 --> 15:48.824
- No, it's not Reese.
- Leona?

15:48.907 --> 15:51.452
It's me. I made the decision.

15:53.329 --> 15:54.580
All right.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.957
We're gonna be officially condemned
on the House floor tomorrow.

15:57.041 --> 15:58.292
That's a good use of time.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.294
- And Giuliani pulled out.
- Yeah?

16:01.253 --> 16:03.339
9/11 widows, first responders...

16:03.422 --> 16:05.633
Some 9/11 widows and first responders.

16:05.716 --> 16:07.968
No, I know. It's the critical mass.

16:08.636 --> 16:11.764
The op-eds, the boycotts, the advertisers,

16:11.847 --> 16:13.974
Reese getting kicked out
of the SOPA meeting,

16:14.058 --> 16:15.309
which you know we're gonna read about.

16:15.392 --> 16:17.102
I just think on this one day...

16:17.186 --> 16:18.646
- No, I totally get it.
- Okay.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.026
- Let me talk to Reese.
- It's not Reese.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.111
- Leona.
- They haven't said a word about 9/11.

16:26.195 --> 16:28.072
They've got bigger fish.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.617
For the record,
I compared the Tea Party to the Taliban,

16:31.700 --> 16:33.494
and we were attacked by al-Qaeda.

16:33.577 --> 16:36.997
I don't want to ask people to make
that distinction on the 10th anniversary.

16:37.081 --> 16:39.958
No, we've never gone wrong
getting our enemies mixed up.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.586
It's just not the day to have the argument.

16:43.087 --> 16:44.546
How do you want to handle it?

16:44.630 --> 16:46.757
You'll get the flu around the 9th or 10th.

16:47.466 --> 16:48.842
Okay.

16:48.926 --> 16:53.138
Listen, they'll do it at your desk
under the <i>News Night</i> logo,

16:53.222 --> 16:55.516

17:00.312 --> 17:01.689
I'm sorry.

No, man. It's the price of doing business.

17:04.108 --> 17:06.402
For what it's worth,
I didn't know you were gonna say it,

17:06.485 --> 17:08.612
- but I was happy when you did.
- Mmm.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.489

No.

'Cause I was thinking
if we could just say so and name it,

I don't want to go back

I meant being friends
and it not being awkward.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.454
It was always awkward.
That's the way things were.

18:40.996 --> 18:43.373
You want to say it wasn't a big deal?
Okay, we're friends.

18:43.457 --> 18:48.128
But you're also staff and at some point,
this conversation is inappropriate.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.631
I don't understand what you're saying.

18:50.714 --> 18:53.300
It's only awkward because you want it to be.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.011
That's a big accusation.

19:01.642 --> 19:03.894
All right. We'll try again tomorrow.

Yeah?

- I'll go.
- Where?

19:27.459 --> 19:30.379
- New Hampshire. I'll cover for Ben.
- Why?

19:30.754 --> 19:32.381
I've never been on the road with a campaign.

19:32.464 --> 19:33.882

19:35.592 --> 19:37.845
- I'd like to go now.
- Nothing to cover.

19:37.928 --> 19:39.513
- Of course there is.
- There isn't.

19:39.596 --> 19:41.974
It's the same three rallies
and three diners a day.

19:42.057 --> 19:43.767
Ben puts down a stand-up at each of them.

19:43.851 --> 19:45.686
When was the last time
you saw any of them on the air?

19:45.769 --> 19:47.354
- I don't know.
- Send Martin.

19:47.437 --> 19:48.605
I'd really like to go.

19:48.689 --> 19:50.399
You're the senior producer here.

19:50.482 --> 19:52.067
- That's great.
- No, I'm saying

19:52.150 --> 19:53.527
you're gonna be fighting it out with stringers

19:53.610 --> 19:55.863
- to get access to low-level staff.
- I know what they do.

19:55.946 --> 19:56.989
Romney's not McCain,

19:57.072 --> 19:59.491
if you've got some vision
of kicking it in the RV with the candidates.

19:59.575 --> 20:00.784
- I don't.
- You're gonna be bored...

20:00.868 --> 20:03.579
Mac, fire me or send me to New Hampshire!

20:13.922 --> 20:15.090
Sorry.

20:19.303 --> 20:20.470
What's wrong with you?

20:20.554 --> 20:23.974
I just want to get out of town
for a couple of weeks.

20:24.308 --> 20:25.475
Mmm-hmm.

20:26.894 --> 20:28.061
(SIGHS)

20:28.937 --> 20:33.150
You know when you blew it with Will,
you went to Peshawar.

20:34.359 --> 20:37.487
There aren't any Taliban fighters in Concord.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.657
It'll just be two weeks.

20:43.327 --> 20:47.080
You should bring Jerry Dantana up from D.C.
to cover for me.

20:47.164 --> 20:50.751
Five suspected militants were killed
by a US drone strike in the FATA.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.961
The unmanned Predator drone
fired two missiles

20:53.045 --> 20:56.006
at a vehicle driving on a main road
in North Waziristan.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.675
Is it illegal? Yes. Is it immoral? You bet.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.928
Are we going to investigate it? Of course not.

21:01.011 --> 21:03.388
MAN ON PHONE: <i>Jerry, you're gonna</i>
<i>drive me crazy with the drone shit.</i>

21:03.472 --> 21:05.599
<i>- I'm gonna have one target your car.</i>
- (CALL WAITING BEEPS)

21:05.682 --> 21:06.892
That's my other line.

21:06.975 --> 21:10.020
But sorry for annoying you with the news.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.272
- Jerry Dantana.
- MACKENZIE: <i>Jerry.</i>

21:12.356 --> 21:14.524
It's MacKenzie in New York.

21:15.484 --> 21:16.526
<i>Oh, hey.</i>

21:17.319 --> 21:19.363
<i>(INTO THE MYSTIC</i> PLAYING)

21:29.039 --> 21:30.707
(PHONE RINGING)

21:35.420 --> 21:37.214
Cats and kittens, grab your mittens.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.882
It's Will McAvoy and Van Morrison

21:38.966 --> 21:41.468
taking you through the night
and <i>Into the Mystic.</i>

21:41.551 --> 21:44.221
- Why didn't you tell me?
<i>- Let's take some calls.</i>

21:44.304 --> 21:46.974
Who do we have on the line, Freddy?
It's MacKenzie from Midtown.

21:47.057 --> 21:48.725
You're talking to the Nightbird.

21:48.809 --> 21:51.561
Why didn't you tell me
you were taken off the 9/11 anniversary?

21:51.645 --> 21:54.648
What are you doing up this late,
MacKenzie from Midtown?

21:54.731 --> 21:56.650
Charlie just called me
to ask how you were handling it,

21:56.733 --> 21:58.193
and I said, "Handling what?"

21:58.276 --> 22:00.362
It was the right thing to do, caller.

22:00.445 --> 22:01.697
Bullshit.

22:01.780 --> 22:03.907
<i>Freddy, you better grab</i>
<i>that seven-second delay.</i>

22:03.991 --> 22:06.910
- Knock it off.
- Let's not make it a big deal.

22:06.994 --> 22:09.079
<i>- You're okay with this?</i>
- I am.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.707
- Can I go back to sleep?
<i>- You're in bed?</i>

22:11.790 --> 22:13.917
It's the middle of the night.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.421
Why is there music playing?

22:17.504 --> 22:20.632
<i>Same reason your night-light's on right now.</i>

22:25.387 --> 22:26.430
All right.

22:27.723 --> 22:28.765
All right.

22:29.891 --> 22:32.102
<i>(INTO THE MYSTIC</i> CONTINUES PLAYING)

22:53.123 --> 22:54.958
Hey, how you doing?

22:57.753 --> 22:59.546
- Hey, excuse me.
- Yes, sir?

22:59.629 --> 23:01.006
- Are you the lead advance?
- Yes, sir.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.174
I'm Jim Harper.

23:02.257 --> 23:04.301
I'm gonna fill in for Ben Furusho
for a couple of weeks.

23:04.384 --> 23:07.888
- How's Ben doing?
- His ankle's broken, but he'll be okay.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.723
I just drove up from New York.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.433
Do I have time to check in
and drop off my stuff?

23:11.516 --> 23:13.643
- Sure, we'll wait as long as you want.
- Thanks.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.067
That was sarcastic?

23:20.150 --> 23:22.778
No, I'll just tell the governor
not to start speaking until you get there.

23:22.861 --> 23:24.488
- Got it.
- So you're with ACN?

23:24.571 --> 23:26.573
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, but the bus is full today.

23:26.656 --> 23:28.992
- You'll have to drive.
- There's...

23:30.285 --> 23:32.954
There's, like, 40 empty seats.

23:33.330 --> 23:36.166
I wasn't wild about
the "American Taliban" broadcast.

23:36.249 --> 23:39.669
Dude, you can't keep me off the bus
just 'cause you didn't like our reporting.

23:39.753 --> 23:41.546
- I can.
- Come on.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.548
Man, I've been driving all night.

23:43.632 --> 23:45.258
Then you better get some gas.

23:45.342 --> 23:48.136
What's Obama got it at, 4.50 a gallon now?

23:49.221 --> 23:50.722
Morning!

24:04.027 --> 24:06.363
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

24:09.533 --> 24:11.284
You could have checked into the hotel first.

24:11.368 --> 24:14.246
I can do that tonight.
You heard about the latest drone strike?

24:14.329 --> 24:15.997
We reported it at 10:00.

24:16.081 --> 24:17.999
Yeah, but that's all we did.

24:18.083 --> 24:21.378
You and Sloan Sabbith
are gonna get along very well.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.796
You're gonna meet Will now, okay?

24:22.879 --> 24:24.881
- We've met.
- He's not gonna remember.

24:24.965 --> 24:27.801
- Will, this is Jerry Dantana.
- We've met.

24:27.884 --> 24:29.636
Of course we have. How you been, man?

24:29.719 --> 24:31.972
We had a long talk the last time he was in D.C.

24:32.055 --> 24:34.975
Great. Jerry's gonna cover for Jim
for a couple of weeks.

24:35.058 --> 24:37.352
- I have no idea why you let him go.
- 'Cause I did.

24:37.435 --> 24:38.979
I'm sure Terry's a good guy
and an excellent senior...

24:39.062 --> 24:40.105
Jerry.

24:40.188 --> 24:41.648
...but I fear change
and that should be respected.

24:41.731 --> 24:42.732
You'll get used to me.

24:42.816 --> 24:44.693
And then Jim will come back
and it'll be a hellscape.

24:44.776 --> 24:46.862
- Why don't we send Harry to New Hampshire?
- Who's Harry?

24:46.945 --> 24:48.155
- He is.
- Jerry.

24:48.238 --> 24:50.240
- See what I mean?
- No, no one does.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.159
- Can I mention something?
- Sure.

24:52.242 --> 24:54.077
I think this network should be doing stories

24:54.161 --> 24:56.580
about the administration's
counterterrorism policies.

24:56.663 --> 24:57.914
And I think while I'm in New York,

24:57.998 --> 24:59.666
it would be a good time
for me to get it started.

24:59.749 --> 25:01.501
It's actually not a great time for me.

25:01.585 --> 25:04.880
But that go-getter initiative you have,
I'm not crazy about that, either.

25:04.963 --> 25:06.715
Remember that long talk we had in D.C.?

25:07.757 --> 25:08.842
Mmm-hmm.

25:09.092 --> 25:10.552
Do you want to lead or do you want to follow?

25:10.635 --> 25:12.679
- MACKENZIE: He wants to follow.
- And barely that.

25:12.762 --> 25:13.763
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- Come in.

25:13.847 --> 25:15.098
It's my office.

25:15.682 --> 25:16.808
Drone strike.

25:16.892 --> 25:17.976
- I don't believe this.
- Drone strike.

25:18.059 --> 25:20.353
- This is Jerry Dantana, who'll be covering...
- There was another one?

25:20.437 --> 25:21.646
- This morning.
- WILL: What you got there, hmm?

25:21.730 --> 25:23.523
Drone strike. Drone strike.

25:23.607 --> 25:24.900
Can't understand what you're saying.

25:24.983 --> 25:26.568
You can too understand what I'm... Reuters.

25:26.651 --> 25:27.694
This is what I was talking...

25:27.777 --> 25:30.197
United States Predator drone
strikes vehicle in northwest Pakistan.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.740
- Can I see that?
- It's a blank piece of paper.

25:31.823 --> 25:33.408
I left the wire report in my office

25:33.491 --> 25:35.368
and on the way here,
I decided I wanted a prop.

25:35.452 --> 25:37.204
You didn't think to just
have someone print it out?

25:37.287 --> 25:39.164
A lot of better ideas are coming to me
as I'm standing here,

25:39.247 --> 25:42.000
- but why don't we let the past be the past?
- It was 12 seconds ago.

25:42.083 --> 25:43.919
MACKENZIE: "Two US officials
identified the target

25:44.002 --> 25:47.339
"of the drone attack
as Abu Hafs al-Shahri, a Saudi national.

25:47.422 --> 25:48.924
- "They declined to provide..."
- They declined to provide

25:49.007 --> 25:50.133
more precise details.

25:50.217 --> 25:53.303
Hold the roll. The government is declining
to reveal highly classified intelligence

25:53.386 --> 25:56.139
and expose the methods
by which we find and kill terrorists?

25:56.223 --> 25:57.224
That is just plain wacky.

25:57.307 --> 25:59.643
- All this is, is a press release.
- It's a blank piece of paper.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.770
No reporter gets to ask,
"Did we kill any civilians?"

26:01.853 --> 26:03.438
Or, "How does Pakistan feel about us

26:03.521 --> 26:05.440
"invading their airspace
to kill people occasionally?"

26:05.523 --> 26:07.984
- Or, "Who authorized the strike?"
- Or, "Who's Abu Hafs al-Shahri?"

26:08.068 --> 26:09.945
He's the head of al-Qaeda in Pakistan.

26:10.028 --> 26:11.488
And the Commander-in-Chief
authorized the strike.

26:12.072 --> 26:13.615
I'd like this for my five minutes tonight.

26:13.698 --> 26:15.867
- It's not an economic story.
- Watch me make it one.

26:15.951 --> 26:17.786
It should be a full panel
right after the A block,

26:17.869 --> 26:19.579
where presumably we'll stay with Libya.

26:19.663 --> 26:21.539
- An ethicist, a military analyst...
- And me.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.500
I'd rather have a human rights expert.
No offense.

26:23.583 --> 26:26.211
- We're not loading the panel to the left.
- Why are we having a panel at all?

26:26.294 --> 26:27.963
- I'll take the economist.
- That happened fast.

26:28.046 --> 26:29.589
You can get in touch with Mike Tapley.

26:29.673 --> 26:31.591
I'd like to use a guy named Cyrus West.

26:31.675 --> 26:33.385
Jim uses Tapley for military analysis.

26:33.468 --> 26:35.637
Yeah, I know,
but I think you're gonna like Cyrus West.

26:35.720 --> 26:39.266
He's a retired Air Force captain,
teaches public policy at the Maxwell School,

26:39.349 --> 26:41.559
and he's a hard-liner on drones.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.019
You're sure you don't want to use Tapley?

26:44.020 --> 26:46.398
Got to start producing sometime.

26:46.481 --> 26:48.275
All right. Start now.

26:48.358 --> 26:50.235
We've got a rundown meeting.

26:54.531 --> 26:56.283
- Drone strike.
- Hey.

26:56.366 --> 26:59.119
Keep your eye on Jerry for me.
I think he wants to win a Peabody.

26:59.202 --> 27:00.328
Mmm.

27:00.662 --> 27:01.705
Who's Jerry?

27:02.414 --> 27:03.540
Okay.

27:06.501 --> 27:10.463
Ben Furusho jumped from the second story
of a Holiday Inn in Nashua.

27:10.547 --> 27:12.507
I've been in that room.
He didn't make it, right?

27:12.590 --> 27:16.011
No, he's out for a couple of weeks.
Jim drove up last night to cover for him.

27:16.094 --> 27:19.681
So say hello to Jerry Dantana,
who most of you already know.

27:19.764 --> 27:21.808
- ALL: Hey, Jerry.
- Jim went on the Romney bus?

27:21.891 --> 27:23.393
- He wanted to go.
- MARTIN: Why?

27:23.476 --> 27:26.521
(STAMMERS) For the experience
and to be a team player.

27:26.604 --> 27:29.107
Couldn't you make the argument
that he just left the team?

27:29.190 --> 27:30.900
You could. Do you want to?

27:30.984 --> 27:33.069
- Not this second, but...
- Seriously, what's going on?

27:33.153 --> 27:35.864
Ben Furusho broke his ankle.
Jim's covering for him for a couple of weeks,

27:35.947 --> 27:37.699
and Jerry's up from D.C. to cover for Jim.

27:37.782 --> 27:40.076
He's gonna produce a panel tonight
in the B or C block.

27:40.243 --> 27:41.786
- B would be great.
- TESS: What everyone's asking is

27:41.870 --> 27:43.496
why would a senior producer

27:43.580 --> 27:45.165
- four months before Iowa...
- No. No.

27:45.248 --> 27:47.042
The clock's run out on this conversation.

27:47.125 --> 27:48.835
If I'm gonna sit in on any rundown meetings,

27:48.918 --> 27:50.503
they can't get mired in these kind of detours.

27:50.587 --> 27:52.589
It's like playing golf
behind a foursome of blind people.

27:52.672 --> 27:55.008
Also, Don will be in our rundown meetings.

27:55.091 --> 27:57.093
Charlie wants us doing
more cross-network stories.

27:57.177 --> 27:59.179
So think of 10:00 as our second act.

27:59.262 --> 28:00.347
Or 8:00 as our warm-up.

28:00.430 --> 28:01.806
How should we think about 9:00?

28:01.890 --> 28:03.975
It's Washington. It doesn't matter.

28:04.059 --> 28:06.269
That's not something we think.

28:06.353 --> 28:07.479
(WHISPERS) They're on speaker.

28:08.146 --> 28:09.439
(QUIETLY) Huh?

28:11.107 --> 28:13.610
- You guys there?
- MAN: <i>Yeah.</i>

28:15.695 --> 28:17.322
The search for Gaddafi continues.

28:17.405 --> 28:20.909
Journalists and dignitaries
are being freed from the Rixos Hotel,

28:20.992 --> 28:23.411
and Mustafa Abdul Jalil
is offering what amounts

28:23.495 --> 28:26.706
to a million and a half dollars and amnesty
to anyone who finds Gaddafi.

28:26.915 --> 28:29.209
- Did he call anyone?
- Did Gaddafi call anyone?

28:29.292 --> 28:31.419
- Jim.
- He hasn't run away from home.

28:31.503 --> 28:33.171
- He called me last night.
- MACKENZIE: Tamara.

28:33.254 --> 28:35.715
The earthquake was a 5.8 and AP is reporting

28:35.799 --> 28:37.550
it caused a crack in
the Washington Monument,

28:37.634 --> 28:39.677
- which will now be closed indefinitely.
- What else?

28:39.761 --> 28:42.972
PPP has Rick Perry at 22 and Romney at 19.

28:43.056 --> 28:45.558
- Tess?
- Steve Jobs is going to officially resign today.

28:45.642 --> 28:47.227
Let's close with that. Martin?

28:47.310 --> 28:49.479
BP's paid five billion in claims
to compensate victims,

28:49.562 --> 28:52.190
and the deficit reduction committee is
launching a website for public input.

28:52.273 --> 28:54.484
Public input on deficit reduction.
I feel better already.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.403
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.696
And are you very sure you want to pitch this?

28:59.656 --> 29:01.616
- Yes.
- MACKENZIE: Bring it.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.077
About 11 weeks ago, June 9th,

29:04.160 --> 29:06.621
the domain name "occupywallstreet"
was registered.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.081
MACKENZIE: And?

29:08.915 --> 29:12.168
I believe America is on the verge
of starting its own Arab Spring.

29:13.253 --> 29:14.295
Really?

29:15.004 --> 29:16.256
Yeah.

29:18.216 --> 29:19.551
Gaddafi, drones.

29:19.634 --> 29:23.221
Let's keep working the others
and I'll make my first cuts at the two.

29:24.848 --> 29:27.475
It was registered by Adbusters
and they sent out an email saying,

29:27.559 --> 29:29.853
- "America needs its own Tahrir."
- We call them elections.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.522
Hang on.
On July 13th, Adbusters sends an email

29:32.605 --> 29:35.608
to 90,000 people telling them
to gather on September 17th.

29:35.692 --> 29:38.111
That's roughly three weeks from now
at the Charging Bull on Wall Street.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.447
The email goes viral in 15 minutes.

29:40.530 --> 29:42.282
New websites were formed,
and there's been instant

29:42.365 --> 29:44.742
and substantial support
across Twitter and Reddit.

29:44.826 --> 29:47.245
August 2nd,
they staged their first organizing meeting

29:47.328 --> 29:49.122
and have been holding
weekly planning meetings,

29:49.205 --> 29:50.290
which they call "general assemblies."

29:50.373 --> 29:52.333
They always start by making a new language.

29:52.417 --> 29:53.835
Fifty to 100 people have been showing up.

29:53.918 --> 29:55.753
Fifty people out of an email blast to 90,000?

29:56.463 --> 29:58.047
Fifty to 100.

29:58.131 --> 30:00.633
And is there a list
of incoherent and unrealistic demands?

30:00.717 --> 30:02.635
Just one thing, and it's perfectly coherent.

30:02.719 --> 30:05.221
A presidential commission
to get money out of politics.

30:06.473 --> 30:07.599
Come with me.

30:09.726 --> 30:11.769
Here's a fax I get every day.

30:11.853 --> 30:14.314
It's the protests
that are going on in New York,

30:14.397 --> 30:15.773
just New York.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.651
Today, Jews Say No

30:18.735 --> 30:21.362
are protesting the air attacks
on the Gaza Strip.

30:21.446 --> 30:23.573
Topless protestors
are demanding that lawmakers

30:23.656 --> 30:25.408
repeal codes against toplessness.

30:25.492 --> 30:28.411
On the East River,
residents are protesting the building

30:28.495 --> 30:30.330
of a high-rise near a soccer field,

30:30.413 --> 30:32.540
and union members are protesting

30:32.624 --> 30:35.168
the United Brotherhood of Carpenters'
new leadership.

30:35.251 --> 30:36.836
And at any given moment,

30:36.920 --> 30:40.089
a group is protesting ads
in the subway, standardized tests,

30:40.173 --> 30:42.008
horse-drawn carriages and fracking.

30:42.884 --> 30:45.720
I know how much you want this,
and I like how much you're going for it,

30:45.803 --> 30:48.765
but you've gotta wait until something's real.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.269
All right.

31:04.155 --> 31:05.698
- Neal.
- Yeah?

31:05.782 --> 31:06.866
What was it called again?

31:06.950 --> 31:08.535
Occupy Wall Street.

31:08.618 --> 31:10.411
- When's the next general assembly?
- Tonight.

31:11.287 --> 31:12.372
You should go.

31:13.289 --> 31:14.290
Sure.

31:24.092 --> 31:27.387
A minute ago, your issue was with legality.
Now it's with the morality.

31:27.470 --> 31:30.056
I'm able to hold
as many as two thoughts in my head at once.

31:30.139 --> 31:31.516
- (PANELISTS CHUCKLE)
- The Fifth Amendment...

31:31.599 --> 31:33.142
The Fifth Amendment,
like all the other amendments,

31:33.226 --> 31:34.894
<i>guarantees certain rights to US citizens.</i>

31:34.978 --> 31:36.729
<i>If an American vacationing</i>

31:36.813 --> 31:39.190
<i>in the Khyber Pass</i>
<i>gets targeted by a Predator...</i>

31:39.274 --> 31:42.151
We need to ask, "Are we creating
more terrorists than we're killing?"

31:42.235 --> 31:43.236
We need to ask...

31:43.319 --> 31:45.655
We don't know exactly
what that collateral damage is

31:45.738 --> 31:48.283
because of the lack
of any transparency or accountability.

31:48.366 --> 31:50.827
<i>Now, factor in that the BDA,</i>
<i>the bomb damage assessment,</i>

31:50.910 --> 31:53.621
<i>counts all military-aged males as militants.</i>

31:53.705 --> 31:55.623
But to your second point,
the fact that drones are...

31:55.707 --> 31:57.083
Aren't they cheaper?

31:57.166 --> 31:59.794
I prefer to be arguing the legality
and the morality, but, no, they're not.

31:59.877 --> 32:03.089
<i>An F-16 costs 50 million and a drone costs 30.</i>

32:03.172 --> 32:05.174
<i>But we procure the drones in groups of four,</i>

32:05.258 --> 32:06.884
<i>combat air patrols, or CAPs.</i>

32:06.968 --> 32:09.679
<i>We buy them as a set, so it's 120 million</i>

32:09.762 --> 32:11.598
<i>versus 50 million for the Falcon.</i>

32:11.681 --> 32:12.849
<i>What we should be talking about...</i>

32:12.932 --> 32:15.059
...costs in terms of human lives.

32:15.143 --> 32:17.228
- That's about all I can stand.
- Here we go.

32:17.312 --> 32:20.148
"I've had all I can stands
and I can't stands no more."

32:20.231 --> 32:22.358
- WILL: Did you want to jump in, Captain?
- I do.

32:22.442 --> 32:25.486
Because my concern
is with the cost of American lives,

32:25.570 --> 32:27.280
here and in combat.

32:27.363 --> 32:30.575
Sloan, you didn't mention
that a $50 million F-16

32:30.658 --> 32:33.661
has to be flown by a pilot
who is somebody's father

32:33.953 --> 32:36.706
and that he can be shot down by
a shoulder-mounted, point-and-shoot Stinger.

32:36.789 --> 32:39.542
Now, Dr. Cochran,
I can appreciate that you're an ethicist,

32:39.626 --> 32:41.294
but we don't face an ethical dilemma.

32:41.377 --> 32:44.797
COCHRAN: Can a drone distinguish between
an al-Qaeda operative and a goat herder?

32:44.881 --> 32:46.633
CYRUS: I don't care and neither should you.

32:46.716 --> 32:48.301
- Get in there, Will.
- CYRUS: <i>And as for the legality,</i>

32:48.384 --> 32:50.803
<i>the authorization</i>
<i>for the use of military force...</i>

32:50.887 --> 32:54.515
Ask him if the AUMF said we were at war
with terrorists or the Pakistani civilians.

32:54.599 --> 32:56.225
<i>...authorized the President</i>
<i>to pursue terrorists</i>

32:56.309 --> 32:58.478
<i>with all necessary appropriate force.</i>

32:58.561 --> 33:00.730
<i>Drones represent the safest form</i>
<i>of lethal action</i>

33:00.813 --> 33:02.899
<i>against terrorist targets, period.</i>

33:02.982 --> 33:04.817
<i>- It's more complicated than that.</i>
<i>- Period.</i>

33:04.901 --> 33:06.653
Ask him about the AUMF.

33:07.070 --> 33:10.073
<i>...AQ and Taliban</i>
<i>senior leadership in Afghanistan,</i>

33:10.281 --> 33:13.743
Pakistan, Yemen,
and the Horn of Africa, period.

33:13.826 --> 33:14.994
Get in.

33:15.078 --> 33:16.829
<i>So, naturally,</i>
<i>here comes the Human Rights Watch...</i>

33:16.913 --> 33:19.123
AUMF.

33:19.207 --> 33:22.293
COCHRAN: <i>The United Nations treaty</i>
<i>on international humanism...</i>

33:22.377 --> 33:26.547
The UN gets four blocks of free parking
on the east side of Manhattan, and that's it.

33:26.631 --> 33:28.675
- That's not it.
- Period.

33:28.758 --> 33:30.843
WILL: We're going to have to end this there.

33:30.927 --> 33:33.429
This is <i>News Night.</i>
We'll be back right after this.

33:35.556 --> 33:37.100
HERB: 2:30 back.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.271
I like to use the full range of punctuation,

33:42.355 --> 33:43.856
commas, colons, parentheses.

33:43.940 --> 33:45.733
- He was trying to get noticed.
- (SCOFFS) No shit.

33:45.817 --> 33:47.110
Why'd Will go quiet? I teed him up...

33:47.193 --> 33:48.986
Will's not your problem.
The panel's your problem.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.905
I'll have a word with him. He's very good.

33:50.988 --> 33:52.198
Use Jim's guys.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.910
Yep. I will.

34:03.751 --> 34:05.294
MAN: Two minutes.

34:08.464 --> 34:10.091
- Good?
- What was with "period, period"?

34:10.174 --> 34:11.843
- I meant it.
- Cy, you're a little over-the-top.

34:11.926 --> 34:13.386
Somebody say something?
Did Will say something?

34:13.469 --> 34:15.054
- No, he's still on the air.
- I'm gonna get asked back?

34:15.138 --> 34:16.973
It's not up to me.

34:17.515 --> 34:18.725
(SIGHS)

34:22.395 --> 34:23.938
All right.

34:24.021 --> 34:26.482
I'm gonna give you a story now.

34:26.566 --> 34:29.068
I'm gonna give you a name to call,

34:29.277 --> 34:31.320
but you have to use me to help you follow it.

34:31.404 --> 34:32.780
(SIGHS) What kind of story?

34:32.864 --> 34:35.658
You have to use me to help you follow it.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.827
What kind of story?

34:39.162 --> 34:42.123
The kind that makes careers
and ends presidencies.

34:42.206 --> 34:43.416
(SCOFFS)

34:45.752 --> 34:47.462
Look, man,

34:47.545 --> 34:49.589
I'm trying to help you,
but you've been fucked up since...

34:49.672 --> 34:51.048
I'm trying to help you.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.010
I'm trying to help you.

34:56.345 --> 34:58.973
"Makes careers and ends presidencies."

35:00.224 --> 35:02.351
A black op called Genoa.

35:03.978 --> 35:06.981
That's <i>News Night</i> for August 24th, 2011.

35:07.064 --> 35:09.484
Terry Smith is coming up next
with <i>The Capitol Report,</i>

35:09.567 --> 35:12.236
followed by Sloan Sabbith
filling in on <i>Right Now.</i>

35:12.320 --> 35:14.447
I'm Will McAvoy. Good night.

35:19.952 --> 35:21.287
MAN: And clear.

35:31.172 --> 35:32.965
You know what?
I agreed with everything he said.

35:33.049 --> 35:35.718
- How about the way he said it?
- It wasn't my style, but...

35:35.802 --> 35:37.512
The AUMF, you were able to hear me, right?

35:37.595 --> 35:38.805
There didn't seem to be an opening.

35:38.888 --> 35:40.181
You didn't have a problem making one

35:40.264 --> 35:42.600
when you went to break 41 seconds early.

35:42.683 --> 35:44.352
Sorry about that.

35:52.109 --> 35:53.361
- Good show.
- Thanks.

35:53.444 --> 35:55.071
- Good night.
- Good job.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.077
WOMAN: Hey, everyone. Good to see you.

36:01.160 --> 36:03.204
If there are no announcements,
we'll get started.

36:03.287 --> 36:04.580
No announcements?

36:05.414 --> 36:08.084
Okay, I see some new faces,
so I have to say up front,

36:08.167 --> 36:10.211
no police and no reporters.

36:11.629 --> 36:12.964
Everybody?

36:15.842 --> 36:16.926
Dude.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.429
- Me?
- You're wearing ACN credentials.

36:20.847 --> 36:24.141
(EXHALES) Yeah, that was pretty stupid.

36:25.059 --> 36:27.645
My name is Neal Sampat, and I'm with ACN,

36:27.728 --> 36:29.105
and I'd love to observe the meeting.

36:29.188 --> 36:30.940
No journalists. No exceptions.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.650
Do you mind if I ask a question?

36:37.154 --> 36:38.281
Question?

36:38.406 --> 36:40.825
Why wouldn't you want to get the word out
about the sit-in on the 17th?

36:40.908 --> 36:42.869
I'm John, and we don't call it a sit-in.

36:42.952 --> 36:44.328
Why wouldn't you want to get the word out?

36:44.412 --> 36:46.497
We do, we just don't need your help to do it.

36:46.581 --> 36:48.374
We want to make sure, no offense,
our message is clear

36:48.457 --> 36:50.042
before it's distorted by the press.

36:50.126 --> 36:51.586
Your message was clear in the email blast.

36:51.669 --> 36:53.546
You want private money out of politics.

36:53.629 --> 36:55.506
- We may want more than that.
- We do want more than that.

36:55.590 --> 36:56.966
Can I ask...

36:58.175 --> 36:59.176
Yeah.

36:59.802 --> 37:01.053
Are you in charge?

37:01.137 --> 37:03.222
My name's Shelly, and no one's in charge.

37:04.056 --> 37:05.600
SLOAN: <i>The findings were bleak,</i>

37:05.683 --> 37:08.644

that less than half of high schoolers

were able to correctly identify the century

37:10.938 --> 37:12.982

<i>sometime after 1750.</i>

37:26.996 --> 37:29.248
- They almost always do.
<i>- ...where a majority of high school students</i>

37:29.332 --> 37:32.835
<i>failed the test given to immigrants</i>
<i>seeking to become naturalized citizens.</i>

37:32.919 --> 37:35.171
<i>Three-fourths couldn't name</i>

- On that note...
- That's all for Wednesday, August 24th.

37:41.719 --> 37:43.971
I'm Sloan Sabbith, filling in for Elliot Hirsch.

37:44.055 --> 37:45.181
<i>Have a good night.</i>

37:45.681 --> 37:46.682
Good show.

37:47.099 --> 37:48.434

37:48.517 --> 37:50.186
<i>You don't have to say it like that.</i>

37:50.686 --> 37:52.772
I said it the regular way.

37:53.940 --> 37:56.067
- Great show.
- You saw it?

37:56.150 --> 37:57.693
I've got it DVR'd.

37:57.777 --> 38:00.154
Listen, was Will okay on the panel tonight?

38:00.655 --> 38:01.697
Sure.

38:02.198 --> 38:03.366
You and me?

38:04.367 --> 38:07.203
I don't know why he didn't jump in
on the AUMF door the guy opened.

38:07.787 --> 38:10.122
I don't know why he didn't cut him off
or throw it to the ethicist.

38:10.206 --> 38:13.250
He seemed to want to make sure
it was clear ACN is antiterrorist.

38:14.126 --> 38:16.212
Maybe he was just getting out of the way.

38:16.671 --> 38:17.713
Yeah.

38:19.256 --> 38:20.716
- Good show tonight.
- You saw it?

38:20.800 --> 38:22.218
- Keep it up.
- Mmm-hmm.

38:28.057 --> 38:29.141
So...

38:31.811 --> 38:34.021
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah.

38:36.190 --> 38:38.234
And you know you're not speaking right now?

38:38.317 --> 38:39.986
When you asked me why I was single,

38:40.069 --> 38:41.988
and I said it was because
you hadn't asked me out,

38:42.071 --> 38:43.823
- I thought it was my last day.
- I know.

38:43.906 --> 38:46.826
And, honestly, it just sounded
like a good line. (CHUCKLES)

38:46.909 --> 38:48.244
I hardly ever land those.

38:48.327 --> 38:49.996
I took it as a joke.

38:50.079 --> 38:51.664
- You did?
- Yeah.

38:51.747 --> 38:54.083
I mean, it was. Good.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.543
All right.

38:55.918 --> 38:57.420
All right.

38:59.213 --> 39:00.214
I'm heading home.

39:00.297 --> 39:03.217
I've got a 13-day streak going
of being a good boyfriend.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.511
- What do you get if you hit two weeks?
- (LAUGHING)

39:06.012 --> 39:07.638
A healthy conscience.

39:09.432 --> 39:11.267
See you tomorrow.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.394
See you tomorrow.

39:15.438 --> 39:17.898
NEAL: Tell me about yourself.
SHELLY: You tell me about yourself.

39:17.982 --> 39:20.317
(LAUGHS) I run our show's website,

39:20.401 --> 39:22.862
and I'm trying to get my EP
interested in this story.

39:22.945 --> 39:24.530
Why isn't he interested already?

39:24.613 --> 39:26.449
She. It's not that she's not interested.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.409
She's just waiting for it to happen,

39:28.492 --> 39:30.077
and I'd rather get in on the ground floor.

39:30.161 --> 39:32.204
She doesn't like ground floors?

39:32.288 --> 39:34.623
(SIGHS) She doesn't think
there's gonna be a second floor.

39:34.707 --> 39:35.916
That's all right.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.918
I still don't have your last name.

39:38.002 --> 39:39.712
I'm Shelly Wexler.

39:39.795 --> 39:43.674
I'm a PhD candidate in anthropology at NYU,
where I also teach.

39:43.758 --> 39:46.093
Is this your first experience with activism?

39:46.177 --> 39:48.554
When I was a minor, I was arrested in Seattle

39:48.637 --> 39:50.389
at the WTO protests.

39:50.473 --> 39:51.891
By "minor," you mean you were...

39:51.974 --> 39:55.019
Not coal. "Minor," under 18.

39:55.102 --> 39:57.605
(LAUGHS) Okay,
were you involved in Seattle?

39:57.688 --> 39:59.565
- Were you involved in the...
- In the violence? No.

39:59.648 --> 40:02.485
I'm nonviolent, as is Occupy Wall Street.

40:06.238 --> 40:09.450
"On September 17th,
we want to see 20,000 flood

40:09.533 --> 40:12.328
"into Lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens,

40:12.411 --> 40:14.872
"peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street."

40:14.955 --> 40:16.040
Then what?

40:16.123 --> 40:18.417
We stay until our demands are met,

40:18.501 --> 40:21.504
the arrest and prosecution
of the people responsible for the crash,

40:21.587 --> 40:23.798
the formation of a presidential commission

40:23.881 --> 40:25.966
to investigate corruption in politics,

40:26.050 --> 40:28.010
the ratification of a constitutional amendment

40:28.094 --> 40:30.346
outlawing the legal designation
of "corporate personhood."

40:30.429 --> 40:33.224
(LAUGHS) You're gonna sleep in a park
until a constitutional amendment

40:33.307 --> 40:35.101
is ratified by three-quarters of the states?

40:35.184 --> 40:37.269
We mean business, Neal.

40:38.854 --> 40:40.231
What's with the hand signals?

40:40.314 --> 40:41.857
It's a Quaker tradition,

40:41.941 --> 40:43.484
and a peaceful way of maintaining order

40:43.567 --> 40:45.194
when your movement has no leaders.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.071
Doesn't a movement need leaders?

40:47.154 --> 40:49.323
We believe in a horizontal structure.

40:50.783 --> 40:53.953
Are you worried that the horizontal structure

40:54.036 --> 40:56.288
is gonna give power
to people who shouldn't have it?

40:56.372 --> 40:57.790
You mean Joel and John?

40:57.873 --> 41:00.209
Shelly, you started off

41:00.292 --> 41:03.295
with one clear and not unreasonable demand,

41:03.379 --> 41:06.340
and now you've got, like, 14 of them,

41:06.423 --> 41:08.634
including arresting Bear Stearns
and the Lehman Brothers.

41:08.717 --> 41:10.553
You doing a story or giving advice?

41:11.137 --> 41:14.515
I haven't been assigned the story,
so I'm giving advice.

41:14.598 --> 41:17.184
And you can't have a protest
unless the media's covering it.

41:17.268 --> 41:18.936
The media is gonna cover it.

41:19.019 --> 41:21.355
But they're gonna cover the drum circles

41:21.438 --> 41:24.024
and crunchy, uninformed college kids
yelling at the earners,

41:24.108 --> 41:26.777
who, coincidently, are the same guys
running Time Warner News Corp.

41:26.861 --> 41:28.737
and AWM.

41:29.155 --> 41:31.073
You don't have the patience
for complicated things.

41:31.448 --> 41:32.741
I do.

41:32.825 --> 41:34.660
Then why do you take Wall Street bullshit

41:34.743 --> 41:36.954
like limited government seriously?

41:37.246 --> 41:39.415
You and I and God and everybody knows

41:39.498 --> 41:40.749
that the banks couldn't survive until lunch

41:40.833 --> 41:43.210
without zero interest loans
from the government

41:43.294 --> 41:45.838
and bailouts when they bet
a hard eight and lose.

41:45.921 --> 41:48.174
There was straight-up fraud
and you covered Casey Anthony.

41:48.257 --> 41:50.801
In our defense,
we were the last ones to do that.

41:50.885 --> 41:52.720
That's a lame defense.

41:52.803 --> 41:55.014
Where was Will McAvoy
when Goldman sold its clients

41:55.097 --> 41:57.433
mortgage-related securities
without disclosing

41:57.516 --> 42:00.853
that the hedge fund manager who chose
the mortgages was betting on them to fail?

42:00.936 --> 42:03.063
Or when Citigroup sold its clients
a mortgage fund

42:03.147 --> 42:05.024
with securities it knew would fail

42:05.107 --> 42:07.359
so the banks could bet against its customers?

42:07.443 --> 42:11.906
Citigroup made 160 million
off its investors losing 700 million.

42:11.989 --> 42:14.992
I expect I'll see your cameras
the first time girls go wild,

42:15.075 --> 42:17.703
but until then, frankly, I just don't trust you

42:17.786 --> 42:20.915
to get a fucking story anywhere close to right,
especially one with distractions.

42:21.874 --> 42:24.126
I want this to succeed.

42:24.627 --> 42:26.754
Then you're on the wrong side of the camera.

42:30.299 --> 42:33.010
Sooner or later, you're gonna want us.

42:34.428 --> 42:37.806
Go back to one clear message,
or you guys are gonna be a joke.

42:39.225 --> 42:41.018
You can bring that up at the next meeting.

42:41.101 --> 42:43.812
I'll show you the hand signal.

43:01.455 --> 43:02.957
(CLATTERING)

43:03.040 --> 43:06.168
- Mmm?
- Sorry. Sorry.

43:06.252 --> 43:07.461
Go back to sleep.

43:07.544 --> 43:08.796
What's going on?

43:08.879 --> 43:10.339
It's okay.

43:13.467 --> 43:15.010
Honey, what are you doing?

43:15.094 --> 43:16.553
I'm just grabbing a couple of things.

43:16.637 --> 43:18.514
I'm gonna be at the Sheraton
on 7th Avenue, okay?

43:19.014 --> 43:20.641
- What?
- It's all right.

43:20.724 --> 43:23.269
- No, no. What's going on?
- I don't want you to...

43:23.352 --> 43:26.105
- I don't want you to get upset.
- Wait.

43:26.188 --> 43:28.440
Did you just say you're going to a hotel?

43:28.524 --> 43:30.901
Yeah, I called Lisa. Everything's fine.

43:30.985 --> 43:32.695
- Wait.
- You can move back into your old place,

43:32.778 --> 43:35.114
but I figured it'd take a few days
and I wanted to give you some room.

43:35.197 --> 43:36.448
You have to slow down and tell me...

43:36.532 --> 43:38.909
I came home and you were asleep,

43:40.202 --> 43:43.080
and I was at the computer
for a little while and I got an email.

43:43.163 --> 43:45.833
Your cousin sent me an email
with a link to a YouTube video.

43:47.334 --> 43:49.128
What does YouTube have to do with...

43:49.211 --> 43:51.297
What's going on?
Why are you going to a hotel?

43:51.380 --> 43:53.841
Why are you packing?
Slow everything down so I can...

43:53.924 --> 43:56.218
MAGGIE ON VIDEO:
<i>...writing her 800-word column</i>

43:56.302 --> 43:58.012
<i>for a newspaper no one's ever heard of,</i>

43:58.095 --> 44:01.307
<i>but I just spent my last $7</i>
<i>having a fight with my best friend,</i>

44:01.390 --> 44:04.184
<i>who, by the way, isn't available at 3:00 p.m.</i>

44:04.268 --> 44:06.437
<i>on a Wednesday to console me</i>
<i>about some guy</i>

44:06.520 --> 44:08.689
<i>because she, too, has a job.</i>

44:08.772 --> 44:11.066
<i>And mostly, when you fall for a guy,</i>

44:11.150 --> 44:12.985
<i>and he's going out with your best friend,</i>

44:13.068 --> 44:14.653
<i>it doesn't work out.</i>

44:14.737 --> 44:16.405
<i>Things get really...</i>

44:19.950 --> 44:21.285
Shit.

44:21.368 --> 44:23.037
Just stand there, okay?

44:23.120 --> 44:25.122
- 'Cause this isn't what it looks...
- (LAUGHING)

44:27.583 --> 44:29.251
Why are you laughing?

44:29.918 --> 44:31.754
Oh, if you can't laugh at this...

44:32.755 --> 44:34.089
I mean,

44:35.007 --> 44:38.344
if I weren't a cast member in this story,
I'd think it was pretty funny.

44:38.886 --> 44:41.680
It's on YouTube, Maggie.
You're a news producer.

44:41.764 --> 44:44.558
You didn't think on a busload of tourists,
somebody wasn't gonna record that?

44:44.641 --> 44:46.560
- Please let me explain.
- Nah.

44:48.187 --> 44:50.105
I spent this whole time
thinking I was a bad guy

44:50.189 --> 44:51.607
for not being in love with you,

44:51.690 --> 44:54.360
- but it turns out...
- Don't say that.

44:56.612 --> 44:58.947
I know that Jim was on the thing.

44:59.615 --> 45:01.200
And he heard you say all that.

45:02.076 --> 45:03.952
My cousin told you?

45:04.036 --> 45:05.954
She doesn't like you.

45:06.288 --> 45:08.624
And she has a crush on me.

45:09.458 --> 45:11.710
She's gonna get married
and stab her husband one day,

45:11.794 --> 45:14.088
- but that's beside the point.
- (LAUGHS)

45:15.798 --> 45:18.384
- Lisa...
- I didn't tell Lisa about the video.

45:18.467 --> 45:20.594
I just told her it didn't work out.

45:23.013 --> 45:24.390
You should call Jim.

45:25.099 --> 45:27.351
Tell him to get off the fucking bus.

45:27.434 --> 45:29.061
We're trying to do the news.

45:31.688 --> 45:33.982
I should be the one to leave.

45:34.525 --> 45:37.403
Come on. I should really be the one to leave.

45:39.988 --> 45:41.782
Take it easy, Maggie.

45:50.249 --> 45:51.542
(DOOR CLOSES)

45:56.797 --> 45:58.882
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

46:07.307 --> 46:08.308
Why'd I get hit in my head?

46:08.392 --> 46:10.436
- I want to pursue drones.
- You won't catch them.

46:10.519 --> 46:12.980
- They fly pretty fast.
- (LAUGHS) Yeah, yeah.

46:13.063 --> 46:14.440
- Jameson rocks?
- Thanks.

46:14.523 --> 46:16.358
I don't think
there's an immoral way to kill terrorists.

46:16.442 --> 46:18.318
- There's an illegal way, and we're doing it.
- I don't care.

46:18.402 --> 46:20.571
'Cause you were
taken off the 9/11 anniversary coverage?

46:20.654 --> 46:22.739
- Yes!
- I knew you were upset.

46:22.865 --> 46:25.868
Of course I'm... Are you kidding me?
I'm flipping out!

46:32.207 --> 46:35.085
- Holy shit, Mac. What the fuck did I do?
- I know. It feels bad.

46:35.169 --> 46:38.172
I used to be exactly the person
that you wanted to see in these moments.

46:38.255 --> 46:40.549
- I don't mean the old days. Like a year ago.
- I know.

46:40.632 --> 46:43.469
- You still are.
- I remind people of the enemy? Jesus!

46:43.552 --> 46:45.137
Every blond-haired guy from Nebraska

46:45.220 --> 46:47.473
reminds people of Muslim extremists.
There's nothing you can do.

46:47.556 --> 46:49.516
- Don't try to make me laugh.
- You can blame it all on me.

46:49.850 --> 46:51.310
If there was a way to blame it on you,

46:51.393 --> 46:52.978
don't you think
I would have done that by now?

46:53.061 --> 46:56.231
I've got Roger Daltrey screaming,
"You better, you better, you bet" in my ear.

46:56.523 --> 46:57.774
Why?

46:57.858 --> 47:01.153
"You better, you better, you bet."
It's about a really... Know British rock.

47:01.236 --> 47:02.905
Why can't there be British rock?

47:02.988 --> 47:05.824
No, K-N-O-W. Know British rock.

47:05.908 --> 47:08.118
"When I say, 'I love you,' you say, 'You better'.

47:08.202 --> 47:09.661
"You better, you better, you bet."

47:10.329 --> 47:12.039
Why is Daltrey screaming that in your ear?

47:13.415 --> 47:16.835
It feels like
the relationship I have with the audience.

47:16.919 --> 47:19.087
You can't believe what this feels like.

47:21.798 --> 47:23.967
As a matter of fact, I can.

47:24.927 --> 47:26.595
- I got that.
- Did you?

47:30.390 --> 47:32.184
Were you really in bed
when I called last night?

47:32.976 --> 47:34.394
Yeah.

47:35.187 --> 47:36.605
It's Pete Townshend.

47:37.523 --> 47:39.775
Townshend wrote the song,
Daltrey's singing it.

47:40.567 --> 47:41.777
When does Jim come back?

47:42.110 --> 47:43.320
Couple of weeks.

47:43.403 --> 47:46.156
Oh, what can possibly happen
in a couple of weeks?

47:47.491 --> 47:49.368
Let's finish our drink.

47:52.454 --> 47:55.374
"When I say, 'I love you,' you say,
'You better."' That person's just mean.

47:55.457 --> 47:58.627
- Are you able to notice the irony?
- I see the irony.

48:00.837 --> 48:02.881
I'm gonna pay for these.
She'll take the Jameson to go.

48:02.965 --> 48:05.634
"I don't really mind how much you love me.
A little is all right."

48:05.717 --> 48:07.678
You get that,
in a completely different context,

48:07.761 --> 48:10.347
Roger Daltrey could be me singing what I'm...

48:10.430 --> 48:12.641
- What I would sing...
- You're saying it works on different levels.

48:12.724 --> 48:15.227
Your relationship with strangers
or my relationship with you?

48:15.310 --> 48:17.229
- The first one.
- I don't think either of us

48:17.312 --> 48:19.189
have the first idea what that song's about.

48:21.316 --> 48:23.151
AUMF.

48:24.278 --> 48:26.863
I've never seen you
leave a rebuttal that fat on the table.

48:26.947 --> 48:28.907
- I don't care whose side you're on.
- I know.

48:28.991 --> 48:32.035
Don't do it again.
And I can pay for my own drinks, pal o' mine.

48:32.119 --> 48:33.829
- Fine.
- Damn right it's fine.

48:33.912 --> 48:35.372
I said, "Fine."

48:36.498 --> 48:38.125
I left my purse up at the office.

48:44.214 --> 48:46.174
And I'll need some cash for the cab.

48:51.138 --> 48:53.515
And for the cab tomorrow morning.

49:01.231 --> 49:03.066
MACKENZIE: <i>If Ben Furusho</i>
<i>hadn't broken his ankle,</i>

49:03.150 --> 49:05.193
if Jim hadn't gone to cover for him,

49:05.277 --> 49:07.613
if Dantana hadn't come up to cover for Jim,

49:07.696 --> 49:09.781
if Mike Tapley

49:09.865 --> 49:12.075
had been on the panel instead of Cyrus West,

49:12.159 --> 49:16.413
if I'd caught it before instead of after...

49:16.496 --> 49:18.290
God damn it!

49:21.001 --> 49:22.210
(MACKENZIE LAUGHS)

49:23.253 --> 49:25.464
You know, nobody believed Genoa at first.

49:25.547 --> 49:28.300
It was impossible to believe.

49:29.426 --> 49:32.638
But piece by piece,

49:32.721 --> 49:37.017
the evidence started coming in
and suddenly it was impossible to deny.

49:39.061 --> 49:42.814
It was the biggest thing
any of us had ever touched, including Charlie.

49:42.898 --> 49:44.983
It was...

49:45.067 --> 49:47.361
The Pentagon Papers,
and we were the only ones who had it.

49:49.571 --> 49:51.907
We average about 1.5 million viewers.

49:51.990 --> 49:54.076
Genoa got 5.5 million.

49:56.244 --> 49:59.915
It was the most viewed program
in the history of cable news.

50:01.041 --> 50:04.753
So, yeah, definitely,

50:04.836 --> 50:07.172
if Ben Furusho had landed in the pool

50:07.255 --> 50:09.424
instead of on the pavement,

50:09.508 --> 50:11.468
we wouldn't be talking right now.

50:11.551 --> 50:14.346
And Will wouldn't be
standing out in the hallway.

50:14.429 --> 50:16.139
He's there, right?

50:20.435 --> 50:22.479
It's because I'm in here.

50:25.607 --> 50:29.444
He's worried he got me in trouble
and not the other way around.

50:29.528 --> 50:32.698
And you've got to admit, for a guy who lives
to be liked by the audience,

50:32.781 --> 50:34.866
he lets us put his life in danger a lot.

50:39.746 --> 50:44.501
When I was little,
I asked my uncle how much a lawyer costs.

50:46.044 --> 50:48.672
He said if it's bad, 300 pounds.

50:48.755 --> 50:50.924
If it's really bad, 400 pounds.

50:51.007 --> 50:53.885
And if it's really bad and you're guilty...

50:55.303 --> 50:56.972
How much do you cost?

50:57.806 --> 50:59.766
1,500 an hour.

51:01.059 --> 51:03.103

51:06.064 --> 51:08.150
It's after midnight. Are you okay?

51:09.901 --> 51:10.986
Yeah.

51:11.069 --> 51:12.904
Let's start from the beginning.

51:14.531 --> 51:17.993
Can you grab some more coffee?
We ran out a while ago.

51:24.541 --> 51:27.210
State your full name
and current occupation, please.

51:28.420 --> 51:30.505
MacKenzie Morgan McHale.

51:30.589 --> 51:34.342
I'm the executive producer
of <i>News Night with Will McAvoy.</i>

51:35.302 --> 51:37.429
And when did you start at this job?

51:48.482 --> 51:51.151
