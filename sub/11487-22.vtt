WEBVTT

00:02.560 --> 00:04.676
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:05.720 --> 00:08.280
So, what's going on in school?

00:08.440 --> 00:09.998
Nothing.

00:11.880 --> 00:14.997
Nothing? You just sit there all day
and stare at the wall?

00:15.160 --> 00:17.435
That's where the clock is.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.397
l got it.

00:24.320 --> 00:28.199
Well, l find it hard to believe
that you just watch the clock all day.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.874
Have you seen my report card?

00:33.880 --> 00:34.995
Jake, it's for you.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.798
-l'm busy.
-lt's a girl.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.632
l don't care.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.193
Her name is Wendy Cho.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.158
Hold on, l'm coming.
Don't hang up.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.357
Hey. How's it going?

00:46.560 --> 00:49.028
Okay, that's something
we haven't seen before.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.829
Yeah, he only moves that fast
when he's got the squirts.

00:55.080 --> 00:58.038
Wendy Cho is the smartest girl.
l wonder why she's calling Jake.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.156
Maybe she lost a bet.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.358
Charlie, that's not nice.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.159
Well, kids are cruel.

01:05.880 --> 01:06.995
Jake is smitten with her.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.833
l hope he's not setting himself up
for disappointment.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.274
Hey, you know what they say.

01:11.440 --> 01:15.274
A man's reach must exceed his grasp,
or what's a penis for?

01:16.960 --> 01:18.029
Who says that?

01:18.200 --> 01:19.838
Okay, l might be paraphrasing.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.480 --> 01:29.959
Okay, call you back. Bye.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.752
-Hey, Dad?
-Yeah, Jake?

01:37.960 --> 01:40.394
Wendy Cho is having
a party tomorrow night, can l go?

01:40.560 --> 01:42.869
Tomorrow?
A little last minute, isn't it?

01:43.040 --> 01:44.792
Well, she wasn't gonna invite me.

01:44.960 --> 01:47.235
Danny Palmer told Amy Sherlack
l didn't like her.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.710
But l told Peter Calahan
to tell Ellen Meisner that l kind of did.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.517
l see.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.992
You do?

01:58.920 --> 02:01.718
He lost me at Amy Sherlack.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.874
-Are her parents gonna be there?
-l guess.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.913
Let the fathers
who have girls worry about that.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.878
Shut up.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.111
All right, l'm gonna wanna meet
her parents.

02:14.280 --> 02:16.191
l don't see any reason
why you can't go.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.875
Cool. Oh, yeah, l'm gonna need
a new shirt, new pants and new shoes.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.871
What's wrong with the clothes
you've got?

02:22.040 --> 02:24.793
Are you kidding?
Everybody's already seen them.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.396
Yeah, but not
with all the latest food stains.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.551
l hear gravy's the new black.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.358
Fine, we'll go shopping tomorrow.

02:34.880 --> 02:35.995
How about a new haircut?

02:36.160 --> 02:37.434
What's wrong with my hair?

02:37.640 --> 02:40.871
Let's just say
everybody's already seen it.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.559
Okay, a new haircut.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.948
So this is your first party
with girls, huh?

02:47.680 --> 02:48.999
Maybe.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.116
Maybe? You're not sure?

02:51.280 --> 02:54.158
You got some cross-dressers
in sixth grade?

02:56.160 --> 02:59.152
Playing a little pin the tail
on the tranny?

03:00.440 --> 03:02.032
Shut up.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.350
Why does everyone
keep telling me to shut up?

03:05.520 --> 03:07.715
Because you're an insensitive dolt.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.677
That's no reason.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.030
This is a very delicate time
in a boy's life.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.919
l remember how nervous l was
about my first boy-girl party.

03:15.080 --> 03:17.753
Oh, right.
That was in college, wasn't it?

03:18.920 --> 03:20.672
Shut up.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.510
What's important now
is that we support Jake.

03:23.680 --> 03:24.999
Agreed.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.116
l'll kick in the wine coolers
and condoms.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.998
What are you gonna do?

03:30.240 --> 03:31.355
You're joking, right?

03:33.960 --> 03:35.518
Okay, let's say l'm joking.

03:37.160 --> 03:40.118
l appreciate your interest,
but this is a father-son moment.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.872
l've been looking forward to it. . .

03:42.040 --> 03:45.476
. . .since l saw the shadow of his little
dingus in the first sonogram.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.831
That's very touching.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.951
And more than a bit creepy.

03:51.120 --> 03:54.192
But still, l can't risk letting
you scar the kid forever.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.756
-What do you mean by that?
-Face it, Alan.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.512
What can you bring to the table. . .

03:58.680 --> 04:01.114
. . .other than a lifetime
of abject failure with women?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.230
lt's not a lifetime yet.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.512
l, on the other hand,
have a wealth of experience to offer.

04:07.720 --> 04:11.395
He's 1 2. He doesn't need to know
how to choreograph a three-way.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.676
l'm not talking about that.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.478
l'm saving that for prom night.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.478
Oh, good.

04:18.640 --> 04:19.993
Let me give you an example.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.628
Jake's at the party.
All the boys are on one side. . .

04:22.800 --> 04:25.234
. . .all the girls are on the other.
What's he do?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.433
You see? You see? Right there.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.559
That ''um'' is the battle cry
of the chronic masturbator.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.477
Define chronic.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.075
The solution to the problem,
my hairy-palmed friend. . .

04:45.320 --> 04:48.278
. . .is to walk up to the prettiest girl
and ask her to dance.

04:48.440 --> 04:49.429
Why the prettiest?

04:49.600 --> 04:51.795
She's the one
all the other guys are afraid of.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.552
She'll be dying for some attention.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.955
What if Wendy Cho
isn't the prettiest girl?

04:56.120 --> 04:57.109
lt doesn't matter.

04:57.280 --> 05:01.068
When she sees our boy dancing with
a hot chick, she'll be all over him.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.280
Of course, it's so obvious.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.995
Bet you're wishing you could
do over sixth grade now, huh?

05:11.120 --> 05:13.839
-l could've danced with Heidi Winkler.
-Yeah, you could've.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.116
-Or Pam Talega.
-Yep.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.429
Or Mary Beth Hicks.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.670
Shoshana Wasserstein.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.238
l don't think so.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.797
Hey, can l get leather pants?

05:27.960 --> 05:29.473
-No.
-No.

05:29.640 --> 05:30.755
Why not?

05:30.920 --> 05:33.434
Because you need something
that lets the farts out.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.993
So. . .

05:40.160 --> 05:41.798
. . .Wendy Cho, huh?

05:41.960 --> 05:43.712
Real subtle, Alan.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.070
Charlie, it's a father-son thing.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.674
Yeah, so was pre-war lraq.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.636
You wanna tell me about her?

05:52.800 --> 05:54.153
Not really.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.719
ls she in your class?

05:55.920 --> 05:59.310
Where else would l meet her?
At a bar?

06:00.480 --> 06:02.118
-My turn?
-No.

06:02.280 --> 06:05.238
l'm just curious
about what kind of person she is.

06:05.400 --> 06:09.791
What it is about her that you find,
l don't know, alluring.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.439
What?

06:12.240 --> 06:14.356
Your dad wants to know
if you think she's hot.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.473
lt's personal.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.596
She's hot.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.758
Are you nervous about this party?

06:22.560 --> 06:24.596
l don't know. Maybe a little.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.637
-Okay, here's what you do.
-Charlie.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.758
Hey, hey, you had your shot.
''Alluring. ''

06:32.040 --> 06:34.031
-ls there gonna be dancing?
-l think so.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.918
Terrific. Do you know how to dance?

06:36.080 --> 06:37.479
Not exactly.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.073
Don't worry, it's easy to fake.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.355
The thing to remember is. . .

06:40.520 --> 06:42.954
. . .the more you move your arms,
the stupider you look.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.311
Oh, that is so not true.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.994
-Just keep it simple and you'll be fine.
-Okay.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.754
Besides, the critical time
is between dances.

06:50.920 --> 06:51.955
What do you mean?

06:52.120 --> 06:55.032
That's when you talk.
More precisely, you get her to talk.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.792
-About what?
-Doesn't matter.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.599
-You won't be listening anyway.
-Oh, Charlie.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.159
Just drive the car.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.515
Yeah, Dad, this is important.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.636
Keep in mind,
you're not looking to score.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.429
-You're getting into the batter's box.
-Wendy doesn't like sports.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.079
You're missing the point.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.389
She plays violin.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.119
Listen to me.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.952
Your goal for the party tonight. . .

07:19.120 --> 07:21.918
. . .is to convince Wendy
you're a mature, sophisticated guy. . .

07:22.080 --> 07:24.878
. . .who sees her not just as a woman
but as a complete human.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.029
Got it?

07:26.200 --> 07:27.474
-l think so.
-Good.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.958
l'm not going.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.317
Hey, hey, not only are you
gonna go. . .

07:33.480 --> 07:36.313
. . .it'll be a night you'll remember
for the rest of your life.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.311
That's what l'm afraid of.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.349
Oh, oh, this is nice.

07:46.520 --> 07:49.830
Yeah, sure, if he's doing
the other kids' taxes.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.959
lt's a timeless style.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.112
No, it just seems timeless
when you're not getting laid.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.554
Put it back.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.153
This is cool.

07:59.320 --> 08:00.594
Yeah. Just one question.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.194
ls your Wendy Cho
a voodoo priestess?

08:04.440 --> 08:06.874
No, l think she's Chinese.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.991
Put it back.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.477
There's something to be said for
letting him make his own choices.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.551
Oh, that's a bunch of crap.
He's an idiot.

08:16.440 --> 08:19.750
lf we let him, he'd go to that party
in a Viking helmet and a cape.

08:22.680 --> 08:23.999
Here we go.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.632
Don't even think about it.

08:28.840 --> 08:32.515
What? lt says, ''l've got a little money,
but l'm not a corporate drone. ''

08:32.679 --> 08:35.831
No, it says, ''l'm pushing 40
and l can't deal with it. ''

08:38.720 --> 08:41.109
All right, maybe the kid needs
his own look.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.548
Jake, come here.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.637
-What?
-Just stand there.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.919
Let's try and visualize
what your personal style might be.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.076
Okay.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.998
Maybe we should start
with the haircut.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.595
Oh, my, has Mommy been trimming
your hair with her teeth?

09:05.760 --> 09:09.799
Not to worry, Ricky loves a challenge.

09:09.960 --> 09:14.397
l'm guessing Ricky also
loves pretending he's a taffy apple.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.155
Wanna take him to your guy
with the shaky hands. . .

09:17.320 --> 09:19.038
. . .and a signed picture
of Desi Arnaz?

09:19.200 --> 09:21.111
Desi Arnaz had beautiful hair.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.556
So, Charles, do we have a game plan
or shall l just follow my muse?

09:24.720 --> 09:27.553
-Can l get a Mohawk?
-No.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.711
We should go
for something young and hip.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.871
-Like your hairstyle?
-Sure, why not?

09:32.040 --> 09:33.917
You'd have to kill me.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.750
Just tighten it up a little.
Nothing extreme.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.309
-Can you make it purple?
-No.

09:39.480 --> 09:40.469
Oh, man.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.950
Relax. Ricky knows what he's doing.
He's been cutting my hair for years.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.792
What if l don't wanna look like you?

09:46.480 --> 09:48.630
-What's wrong with the way l look?
-Nothing.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.189
lf you're a statue in front
of a Big Boy restaurant.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.715
-Are you freaking kidding me?
-Charlie.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.517
-The kid should be so lucky.
-We'll wait over here.

09:58.720 --> 10:02.429
l'm buying the little wise-ass a $ 75
haircut and he's taking shots at me?

10:02.600 --> 10:04.670
You said it,
he has to find his own look.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.400
Yeah, let him find it
on somebody else's MasterCard.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.949
-Look at his point of view.
-What's his point of view?

10:10.120 --> 10:13.715
Well, put overalls on you and you do
kind of look like the Big Boy.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.596
Stand like this for me.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.079
Shut up.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.954
By the way,
did you have the talk with him?

10:25.120 --> 10:27.873
Oh, sure.
l mean, well, we've had a talk.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.873
Covered the basics.
He knows where babies come from.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.031
-How they got there.
-That's all?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.838
He's going to this party clueless. . .

10:35.000 --> 10:37.230
. . .about how much fun he can have
between ''Hi'' . . .

10:37.400 --> 10:39.675
. . .and ''What do you mean,
you missed your period?''

10:39.840 --> 10:42.479
lt's a kids' party.
Pizza, soft drinks, a little dancing.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.949
Oh, really? You know
what l was doing at his age?

10:45.120 --> 10:46.917
-l don't wanna hear it.
-You sure?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.991
lt involves Shoshana Wasserstein.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.031
You danced
with Shoshana Wasserstein?

10:52.200 --> 10:54.236
Actually, that's one thing
we didn't do.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.350
Nevertheless, l'm Jake's father.

10:58.520 --> 11:01.114
l believe childhood
should be a time of innocence.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.714
l agree. Childhood should be
a time of innocence.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.632
And Bambi's mother shouldn't die.

11:05.800 --> 11:09.156
Lap dances should be complimentary
after the fifth cocktail.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.349
But that's not the world we live in.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.670
This party tonight
is the initial round. . .

11:14.840 --> 11:17.308
. . .in a lifelong process
of sexual elimination.

11:17.480 --> 11:20.278
-Oh, really?
-Think of it as musical chairs.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.000
But when the music stops,
the guys who have a clue. . .

11:23.160 --> 11:26.038
. . .are sitting on a woman
instead of a chair.

11:26.840 --> 11:30.594
The guys who have no clue,
they'll spend their teenage years--

11:30.760 --> 11:34.389
Well, l certainly don't need
to tell Dungeon Master Alan.

11:39.440 --> 11:41.829
Come on, Jake,
we're gonna be late for the party.

11:43.280 --> 11:44.872
l'm ready.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.030
-lt's very nice.
-Yeah, l think we're good.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.792
Turn around.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.715
You're supposed to take
the price tag off.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.316
But you said it was good
to be seen in expensive clothes.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.353
You still want him
to learn from his mistakes?

12:02.520 --> 12:03.589
Fine. Can we go now?

12:03.760 --> 12:04.749
Hang on.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.512
Let's see the dance moves.

12:12.080 --> 12:15.072
Don't stare at your shoes,
eyes on the girl at all times.

12:15.240 --> 12:17.549
Pretend you care.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.634
Good. Good. Good. Now. . .

12:20.800 --> 12:23.792
. . .how do you stand when you know
Wendy's looking at you?

12:25.880 --> 12:28.997
That's it. A little head bob.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.958
Show me the sleepy eyes.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.717
l said sleepy, not brain-dead.

12:39.680 --> 12:40.669
All right.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.033
-Who's the man? Who's the man?
-l'm the man. l'm the man.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.599
Okay, let's go get them.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.949
-Alan.
-l'm coming.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.389
21 38. . .

13:01.560 --> 13:03.391
. . .21 36. . . .

13:03.560 --> 13:06.279
Try the house with the balloons
tied to the mailbox.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.710
Oh, right.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.119
Okay, let's go.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.709
Where are you going?

13:16.560 --> 13:19.632
l wanna meet her parents, say hello,
find out when to pick you up.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.677
Alan, you take one step out this car. . .

13:21.840 --> 13:24.434
. . .l will beat your brains out
with a tire iron.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.917
Thank you, Uncle Charlie.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.515
Have fun.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.796
Call my cell when you want me
to pick you--

13:31.960 --> 13:33.598
Up.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.478
There he goes.

13:37.640 --> 13:41.519
My son is attending
his first boy-girl party.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.633
Who's that opening the door?

13:48.800 --> 13:50.916
Oh, oh, that's Wendy Cho.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.389
Oh, good, she's cute.
The kid's got taste.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.357
But she's like a foot taller than him.

13:55.520 --> 13:56.509
That's all right.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.399
When they slow dance,
his head will be perfectly positioned.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.391
Oh, get your mind out of the gutter.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.592
Right, like you never copped
a feel with your ear?

14:04.760 --> 14:06.512
No.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.915
Okay, once with Aunt Sophie.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.278
But that was an accident.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.913
You know what l'm talking about.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.957
Oh, yeah.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.199
Here you go.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.998
Thank you.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.556
Oh, looks good.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.711
She's pretty, huh?

14:29.200 --> 14:30.394
Yeah, l guess.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.638
What's the matter with you?

14:32.800 --> 14:35.268
What if l sent him out there
too soon?

14:35.440 --> 14:36.634
What if he's not ready?

14:36.800 --> 14:39.075
Don't beat yourself,
you did everything you could.

14:39.240 --> 14:42.550
There just wasn't enough time,
damn it.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.188
lt's out of our hands.
We let nature take its course.

14:45.360 --> 14:50.036
Sounds good, unfortunately nature
keeps telling him to scratch his ass.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.595
-lt's Jake.
-God, l knew it. Give me that.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.478
No, no, no, l got it.

14:56.640 --> 14:57.868
Hey, what's up, buddy?

14:58.600 --> 14:59.749
He wants to come home.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.194
Why? He just got there.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.316
Why? You just got there.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.798
He says it's personal.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.799
Give me that.

15:07.960 --> 15:11.669
Jake, Jake, l'm gonna
talk you through this.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.553
Just pipe down and listen.

15:14.720 --> 15:17.154
Finish your cookie later.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.713
Where's Wendy Cho right now?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.877
How many girls is she talking to?

15:24.040 --> 15:26.838
Okay, okay,
you gotta split her from the herd.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.869
Walk over and say
you have something to ask her.

15:31.040 --> 15:34.510
Then take her hand
and lead her away from her friends.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.230
Okay, then put the cookie down first.

15:39.520 --> 15:43.195
Now, when you have some privacy,
l want you to look her in the eye. . .

15:43.360 --> 15:47.114
. . .and say you were lying.
You just wanted to be alone with her.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.835
lt will too work.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.150
All right, call me back.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.316
God, l just wish l could be there
with him.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.550
-Me too.
-Thanks.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.552
Ready for a refill?

16:01.720 --> 16:03.358
Sure.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.552
Are you okay?

16:05.720 --> 16:08.518
Yeah, l'm fine.
l'm just worried about my nephew.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.432
He's at his first boy-girl party.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.750
Oh, that's adorable.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.319
He's my son.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.475
-How old is he?
-Twelve.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.312
Kid's the apple of my eye.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.634
You're so sweet.

16:24.800 --> 16:28.475
Excuse me, officially,
it's my apple and my eye.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.279
Okay.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.155
Connie.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.153
-Charlie.
-Would you like some pie, Charlie?

16:37.320 --> 16:38.594
lt's on the house.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.716
Your house or mine?

16:40.880 --> 16:43.474
You're awful. Mine.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.396
Un-freaking-believable.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.552
Look, Connie, l'm kind of tied up
tonight with my nephew.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.551
Why not write your number
on the bill?

16:54.160 --> 16:55.912
Already did.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.239
What?

17:01.760 --> 17:04.558
-He's my son.
-But l know how to use him.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.675
Oh, it's Jake.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.473
Talk to me.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.232
No, you're the man.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.594
You're the man.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.633
Great. Keep me posted.

17:22.839 --> 17:23.989
Who's the man?

17:24.160 --> 17:25.559
Right.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.679
What? What?

17:31.960 --> 17:33.871
lt's going well.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.755
He's gonna be one of the last
to leave. That's a good sign.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.315
Yeah.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.995
You tend to lose track of time
when you're in a closet with a girl.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.750
l just wish l could've
covered kissing with him.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.912
Please, God, don't let him pucker.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.110
-What's wrong?
-Oh, it's nothing.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.430
Don't worry, Wendy will know
what to do.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.034
She's probably been practicing
with her girlfriends.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.839
Man, chicks are so lucky.

18:06.040 --> 18:09.999
lt's not the kissing.
lt's this whole thing.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.799
l'm sorry if l interfered
with the father-son deal, but--

18:12.960 --> 18:15.269
No, no, no,
you've done a great job.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.192
Jake's really lucky to have you.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.469
So, what's the problem?

18:20.920 --> 18:22.512
l guess l'm a little jealous.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.631
-Of what?
-Charlie. . .

18:24.800 --> 18:27.109
. . .do you have any idea
what it would've meant. . .

18:27.280 --> 18:30.352
. . .to have you take me under your wing
the way you have with Jake?

18:30.520 --> 18:32.431
Oh, here we go.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.511
Dad was gone, there was no one
to teach me.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.875
You know how l found out
about French kissing?

18:37.040 --> 18:39.759
Mom sliced a plum in half
and stuck her tongue in it.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.592
You could have taken
that secret to the grave.

18:43.760 --> 18:45.352
And that's not all she showed me.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.990
To this day, l can't eat plums,
dried apricots or bananas.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.589
All right, all right, l'm sorry.

18:53.960 --> 18:59.034
Look, l was young, l was selfish,
l should have been there for you.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.119
You know, it's not too late.

19:04.240 --> 19:06.549
That's a real nice idea, buddy.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.472
But l'm afraid it is.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.550
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.998
Well, how'd it go?

19:16.160 --> 19:17.195
Okay.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.511
-Just okay?
-Alan, leave it alone.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.517
All right.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.312
-So, Jake, congratulations.
-For what?

19:26.480 --> 19:28.471
You got lipstick all over your mouth.

19:28.640 --> 19:29.629
Oh, man.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.109
Relax, l was bluffing.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.519
But congratulations.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.511
Thanks.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.955
Well, it was touch-and-go there
for a while.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.634
But l think Jake's off
to a good start with the ladies.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.358
Yeah, listen, Charlie.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.909
Don't take this the wrong way. . .

19:54.080 --> 19:58.392
. . .but l really don't want Jake
to grow up like you.

19:59.080 --> 20:02.277
Alan, how could l possibly
take that the wrong way?

20:02.480 --> 20:05.278
No, l mean,
l don't want him to be a player.

20:05.440 --> 20:08.910
l want him to value women and
cherish his relationships with them.

20:09.080 --> 20:13.437
Hey, l value women,
l cherish my relationships with them.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.990
But l take your point.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.995
Hey, Dad, how old
do you have to be to get married?

20:21.160 --> 20:23.310
l guess 1 8. Why?

20:23.480 --> 20:25.948
Just wondering how long
Wendy and l have to wait.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.476
One kiss
and he's ready to marry the girl.

20:30.680 --> 20:31.795
So?

20:31.960 --> 20:34.713
So you don't have to worry.
He's definitely your son.
