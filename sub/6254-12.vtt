As far as any government

Pelant killed my friend.

02:42.038 --> 02:43.619
She thinks
Pelant is back.

02:51.339 --> 02:54.046
The skin was almost
completely removed.

As was the mandible,

the victim was male.

out someone up like this?

The technique used
on these tissue incisions
could help determine that.

[ Hodgins ]
They’re from Egypt.

The Egyptians revered
the crocus as a symbol

03:26.832 --> 03:29.244
[ Hodgins ]
Yeah, and last we knew,
Pelant was in Egypt.

Okay, that settles it.
It’s Pelant.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.458
Pelant is back from Egypt.
The real question is why.

03:35.549 --> 03:39.258
I almost killed him
a few months ago.
He’s trying to get back at me.

03:39.345 --> 03:42.212
Well, that definitely factors
into it. But with Pelant,
there’s always something more.

03:42.306 --> 03:46.140
We can’t keep Cam out of this.
We have to examine
this cadaver in the lab.

03:46.227 --> 03:49.219
— Call the Bureau
and get a tech team out here.
- Wait, no, no, no. No teams.

— No one can know
about this but us.
— That’s not how I work.

The game has changed, Booth.
Pelant is targeting us directly.

03:55.903 --> 03:59.145
We have to hit him back now,

Called in a favor.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.246
It must have been
some favor.

served in Iraq,
built up major dive hours...

12:36.340 --> 12:39.082
and managed to get wounded
by an R.P.G. in Central Africa.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.918
Well, if he pulled
an assignment in Africa,
that would be off the record.

12:42.012 --> 12:45.004
Exactly. That’s why
we’ve never seen these.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.799
You still want me
off this one?

12:48.894 --> 12:50.680
Nah, it’s too late
for that.

from Leah Kressin.

12:58.528 --> 13:03.113
She is the best
hematologist I know,
top expert in her field.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.239
I completely trust her work,
and... she couldn’t ID.
the gas that Pelant used.

13:07.329 --> 13:09.194
I’m sorry.

13:09.331 --> 13:12.823
But you’re not giving up
on this, right?
I don’t know what else to do.

13:12.918 --> 13:15.830
There’s no residue in your blood.
There’s no residue on the victim.

13:15.921 --> 13:18.253
The tech team went over
every inch of your place.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.503
Then they go over it again.
I mean, every millimeter.
Someone missed something.

13:21.593 --> 13:25.177
Given the time and resources
we have, I have to go with what
has the highest probability.

13:25.263 --> 13:28.596
If it’s about resources,
just tell me how much
you need me to give you.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.976
Money isn’t the issue.
Please.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.927
Money is always the issue.
It’s a good thing that I’m rich.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.725
Half the funding
for the Jeffersonian
comes from the Cantilever Group.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.727
We have to stay focused
on what’s important.

He was in my bedroom.

13:39.987 --> 13:43.150
He threatened my wife,
my child.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.403
Nothing is more
important than that.

Mustered out in 2008.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.288

14:01.383 --> 14:03.874
Not many SEALs worked both
Central Africa and Iraq.

14:03.969 --> 14:05.630
He’s the only hit
Flynn and I could find.

14:05.721 --> 14:09.305

have to notify anyone.

a family after all.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.069

out these out of magazines
to prep open houses.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.162
Freeman didn’t want to
form any attachments.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.163
He was ready to leave
at any time.

14:39.254 --> 14:42.246
There’s a lot of hotel receipts
here from Cairo, Dubai.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.588
Wait, wait.

14:51.600 --> 14:55.513
Look at this. He left
his gun locker open.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.890
No, he didn’t.
A SEAL would never do that.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.393
Pelant wanted us
to find this open.

15:00.484 --> 15:02.315
These are all
proprietary weapons.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.402
I’ve seen some of these weapons
in Iraq, but our boys, they
never got this kind of stuff.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.613

that’s who.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.196

Yeah.

Listen.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.949
Our man Freeman,
he was work/ng
for Serberus.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.532
- You know what we’re in for?
- Yeah.

15:18.627 --> 15:21.539
- What’s Serberus?
- It’s the world’s biggest
provider of mercenaries.

15:21.630 --> 15:24.963
Not only do they supply
the arms, but they supply
the men who use them.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.632
So Pelant killed
a highly-trained
professional soldier.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.335
A target like that
is a huge risk,
even for him.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.046
— He’s escalating.
— Yeah, but the question is why.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.651
I ran a tox screen—
no poisons.

15:43.735 --> 15:47.523
But I found
highly elevated levels
of adrenocorticosteroids.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.071
Have you found
any signs of torture?

15:50.158 --> 15:52.865
Look at these antemortem
striations...

15:52.953 --> 15:55.911
on the fourth and fifth
cervical vertebrae.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.783
They were made by needles.

15:57.874 --> 16:01.241
That would have pierced
the nerve ganglions on
either side of the vertebrae.

16:01.336 --> 16:04.248
The pain would be intense,
but it wouldn’t kill him.

16:04.339 --> 16:07.752
Not in one session, but this
could’ve gone on for days.

16:07.843 --> 16:10.459
The body would continue
to pump out adrenaline,

16:10.554 --> 16:13.967
stressing his heart
until he suffered
a lethal bradyarrhythmia.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.218
He literally died from pain.

16:19.688 --> 16:22.600
Xavier Freeman
was tortured and killed
by a man we’re tracking.

16:22.691 --> 16:25.933
So we’d like Freeman’s records—
every operation that
he’s had access to.

and you missed every time.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.559
You’ve been through a lot.

— Slow your roll, Seeley Booth.

18:15.136 --> 18:18.378

I want him as badly as you do.

18:18.473 --> 18:22.637
So you come back
with something I can work with,
and I will get you that warrant.

What is it?

18:31.069 --> 18:34.436
ljust spoke with Dr. Hodgins,
and I’m concerned about him.

18:34.531 --> 18:38.023
You need to check with me
in advance before you
assess any of my people.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.655
That wasn’t my intention.
He’s a friend.
He suffered a shock.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.950
And yet you feel compelled
to see me about it.
He’s obsessive.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.326
He’s manic. He’s not
evincing good judgment.

18:46.418 --> 18:50.161
I don’t think it’s healthy for
Hodgins or this investigation
for him to be working right now.

18:50.255 --> 18:53.292
You should just send him home,
let him get some rest.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.374
I’m not gonna do that.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.924
Why?

18:57.012 --> 18:59.094
Because Pelant
is afraid of Jack Hodgins.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.307
That’s why he put the body
in his house.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.552
He wants him off the case.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.142

— Snorting lidocaine.

There is a chance that some
of the gas Pelant used on us
is still in the tissue.

Then let Cam do it.
I mean, she’s an MD.

my professional opinion
right now.

it’s painful, there’s
a risk of complications,

the slim chance
that it’s even gonna work.

Pelant said that he left me
a “masterpiece.”

dissected Barbary apes...

how the human body works.

the father of modern anatomy,

24:14.120 --> 24:17.738

some significant errors.

closely resembles plate 34—

so differently, it’s difficult
to make a comparison.

Well, Vesalius looped
a rope around the back

the orbital cavity...

You stay on the drone.

37:45.139 --> 37:48.506
Why is Pelant giving us
the target in advance?
He doesn’t do that.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.012
He wants us to feel helpless
when the drone
blows up that school.

in the area?
— Do we?

37:53.689 --> 37:56.271

in flight, 93 miles out.

We’ll be broke in a minute.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.256
No, no, no. It’s running
off of Serberus’s network.
I can shut it down.

38:23.385 --> 38:26.297
No, you can’t, Angie.
You can’t.
Why not?

shut down Serberus,

38:28.390 --> 38:30.802
we’re gonna lose contact
with the drone.

to choose.

38:33.228 --> 38:36.186
Keep our money,
or save those girls.

38:36.273 --> 38:37.513

with direct anonymous attestation.

that helps us.
