00:06.200 --> 00:08.566
( theme music playing )

01:51.410 --> 01:54.106
( birds twittering )

02:08.820 --> 02:11.527
( man speaking on TV)

02:11.630 --> 02:14.326
Once again no rain,
but mostly high clouds.

02:14.430 --> 02:16.921
Since you got
so much information,
can you tell us

02:17.030 --> 02:18.895
why it smells like skunk
outside the studio

02:19.000 --> 02:20.638
- in Hollywood here?
- It does?

02:20.740 --> 02:23.732
Woman:
Sam, do you know
why that is?

02:23.840 --> 02:26.934
(clanks)

02:27.040 --> 02:29.577
( kettle hissing )

02:33.320 --> 02:36.687
( thumps )

02:36.790 --> 02:40.658
( kettle whistling )

02:55.700 --> 02:57.565
( water running )

03:02.810 --> 03:05.347

03:28.070 --> 03:30.300
Brenda:
OKAY. OKAY, NOW!

03:30.410 --> 03:32.298
HAPPY BIRTH DAY!

03:32.410 --> 03:34.628
WELL, THANK YOU.

03:34.740 --> 03:36.605
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:36.710 --> 03:39.816
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

03:42.250 --> 03:45.879
- ARE YOU EXCITED TO SEE
ALL YOUR FRIEYNEEAT-IAT DAYCARE?

03:47.760 --> 03:51.025
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
IN THE BATHROOM?

03:51.130 --> 03:52.529
ASIDE FROM A FEW
NEW WRINKLES, NO.

03:52.630 --> 03:55.349
IT WAS RIGHT
BY THE TOILET.

03:56.330 --> 03:57.968
ARE YOU PREGNANT?

03:58.070 --> 04:00.868
YES.

04:00.970 --> 04:03.165
THAT'S GREAT!
CONGRATULATIONS!

04:03.270 --> 04:05.465
CONGRATULATIONS?
TO WHOM?

04:05.570 --> 04:08.300
- COME ON, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO SAY?
- NOTHING.

04:08.410 --> 04:11.470
- TO YOU, TO ALL OF US!
- NO NO, WHATEVER COMES UP
IN YOUR HEAD.

04:11.580 --> 04:13.616
- BRENDA, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- NO, NOTHING.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.369
THANK YOU FOR YOUR
HEARTY CONGRATULATIONS.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.687
- COME ON, HONEY.
- ARE YOU SURE
IT'S POSITIVE?

04:17.790 --> 04:20.054
THERE YOU GO, HONEY BUN.
MAYA'S GONNA BE LATE.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.049
BRENDA, I'M HAPPY, I--

04:23.160 --> 04:25.185
COME ON, GRAB HOLD.

04:25.290 --> 04:27.952
- BRENDA--
- SEE YOU TONIGHT,
I GO'I'I'A GET READY FOR WORK.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.392
I'M HAPPY,
JUST TELL ME AGAIN.

04:38.870 --> 04:41.270
Billy: FUCK!

04:41.380 --> 04:43.371
HAVE YOU SEEN MY
SKI IRAQ SHIRT ANYWHERE?

04:43.480 --> 04:45.869
- YOU HAD THAT ON LAST NIGHT.
- YEAH, I DIDN'T ASK

04:45.980 --> 04:48.210
WHETHER I HAD IT ON
LAST NIGHT, I ASKED
WHETHER YOU'VE SEEN IT.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.140
I HAVEN'T.

04:50.250 --> 04:51.842
( yells )
SHIT!

04:51.950 --> 04:54.089
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?!

04:54.190 --> 04:56.488
( exhales )
NOTHING,

04:56.590 --> 04:59.024
I JUST DON'T THINK
I CAN WEAR CLOTHES TODAY.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.122
DON'T YOU HAVE CLASS?

05:02.230 --> 05:05.597
YEAH, WELL,
NOTHING FEELS RIGHT.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.635
LOOK, MAYBE YOU SHOULD LIKE
SEE A DOCTOR OR SOMETHING.

05:08.740 --> 05:10.105
FOR WHAT?

05:10.210 --> 05:11.939
I DON'T KNOW,
DRY SKIN?

05:12.040 --> 05:14.679
- ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?
- WELL, YEAH,

05:14.780 --> 05:17.840
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW,
EVERY DAY WITH YOU
IT'S LIKE A BIGGER PROBLEM.

05:17.950 --> 05:21.113
NOT EVERYTHING IS SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN MEDICATE, CLAIRE!

05:21.220 --> 05:23.415
I KNOW THAT.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.340
IT'S JUST
MY CLOTHES ARE...

05:25.450 --> 05:28.385
ALL HEAW TODAY...

05:28.490 --> 05:30.424
OR SOMETHING.
I WANT MY SKI IRAQ SHIRT.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.994
OKAY, I'LL HELP YOU
FIND IT.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.318
OKAY, THAN KS.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.905
( exhales )
THAT'S ALL I WANTED
WAS SOME HELP.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.433
OKAY.

05:48.910 --> 05:50.639
OKAY.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.969
SHIT, I FEEL LIKE
I STILL HAVE SOMETHING ON.
( chuckles )

05:55.850 --> 05:58.944
MARY, KEITH AND DAVID
HAVE SOMETHING THEY WANT
TO ASK YOU.

05:59.050 --> 06:01.359
I'M ON PINS
AND NEEDLES.

06:01.460 --> 06:04.054
WE'VE DECIDED
THAT WE WANT YOU
TO BE OUR EGG DONOR

06:04.160 --> 06:05.684
AND OUR SURROGATE.

06:05.790 --> 06:08.918
- BOTH?
- IS THAT OKAY?

06:09.030 --> 06:12.158
YEAH, IT'S JUST I'VE
NEVER BEEN PROPOSED TO
LIKE THIS.

06:12.270 --> 06:13.965
MOST PEOPLE ARE
SO BUSINESSLIKE.

06:14.070 --> 06:15.833
YOU GUYS ARE
SO SWEET.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.659
- WHOSE SEED
WILL IT BE?
- HIS.

06:20.110 --> 06:22.977
SO THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO

06:23.080 --> 06:25.469
- FOR KEITH AND DAVID?
- YEAH, I'D LOVE IT.

06:25.580 --> 06:28.344
- I DIDN'T SAY YES?
- UH, NO.

06:28.450 --> 06:30.941
OH, THEN YES YES,
OF COURSE, YES!

06:31.050 --> 06:33.211
WELL, GOOD.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.254
CAN I ASK A QUESTION?

06:35.360 --> 06:37.248
PLEASE, DAVID.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.227
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.
ASK ASK ASK.

06:40.330 --> 06:42.491
IS THERE CAFFEINE IN THAT?

06:42.600 --> 06:45.467
OH, WE'RE INTO THAT
ALREADY.

06:45.570 --> 06:47.595
OKAY. IT WAS SO NICE
FOR A MINUTE THERE.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.362
NO, I WAS JUST THINKING--
I'VE READ SOME BOOKS

06:50.470 --> 06:53.268
THAT SAY CAFFEINE MAKES IT
HARDER TO CONCEIVE...

06:53.380 --> 06:55.575
SOMETIMES, THAT'S ALL.
JUST CURIOUS.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.648
MAYBE YOU'VE READ
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.639
I GET PREGNANT SUPER-EASILY,
DAVID, TRUST ME.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.718
IT'S KIND OF UNSE'I'I'LING.
( glggleS)

07:02.820 --> 07:05.345
- OKAY.
- BUT I ASSURE YOU,

07:05.450 --> 07:08.010
ONCE WE'VE SIGNED THE PAPERS
I WILL LOOK FORWARD

07:08.120 --> 07:10.224
TO WORKING VERY CLOSE
WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE

07:10.330 --> 07:11.922
OUR BABY IS HEALTHY
AND GETS CONCEIVED.

07:12.030 --> 07:13.520
THANK YOU.

07:13.630 --> 07:16.758
GOSH, I'M EXTRA EXCITED.
AREN'T YOU?

07:16.870 --> 07:20.931
WELL, I THINK
WE'RE ALL VERY EXCITED.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.669
- ARE YOU FINISHED
WITH YOUR EGGS?
- I'M DONE, THANK YOU.

07:24.770 --> 07:27.773
WHEN I SAW THE BUILT-INS,
I FELL TOTALLY IN LOVE,

07:27.880 --> 07:29.677
AND I PUT
MY NAME ON THE LIST.
THE OWNER CALLS ME

07:29.780 --> 07:31.702
YESTERDAY MORNING, HE SAID
I COULD HAVE THE PLACE.

07:31.810 --> 07:33.778
BUT THEN HE CALLED BACK
AN HOUR LATER AND SAID

07:33.880 --> 07:35.871
HE WASN'T RENTING IT,
HE WAS GONNA SELL IT.

07:35.980 --> 07:37.982
- OH, THAT'S SO ANNOYING.
- ( sighs )

07:38.090 --> 07:40.684
WHATEVER, I'LL FIND
A PLACE, I GUESS.

07:40.790 --> 07:43.258
- IT'S ALL GOOD.
- TIME'S UP.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.726
OH, I WAS JUST
FINDING MY RHYTHM.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.923
NEXT WEEK WE START
OUR CAPELETS,

07:48.030 --> 07:51.363
SO PICK OUT
SOME COLORFUL STUFF
AND GET READY.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.665
AND REMEMBER
YOUR CLASS FEES INCLUDE

07:53.770 --> 07:55.829
UNLIMITED KNITTING
CIRCLE TIME,

07:55.940 --> 07:57.999
SO FEEL FREE
TO DROP IN WHENEVER.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.408
- Woman: SEE YOU NEXT TIME.
- CIAO-CIAO, VICTORIA.

08:00.510 --> 08:02.546
CIAO.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.572
SUDDENLY ONE "CIAO"
WAS NOT ENOUGH.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.012
SHE SAYS
EVERYTHING TWICE.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.371
( giggles )

08:08.480 --> 08:10.414
SO...

08:10.520 --> 08:13.683
GIVE US
THE GEORGE REPORT.

08:13.790 --> 08:16.953
WELL, THIS WEEK
HAS NOT BEEN A CAKEWALK

08:17.060 --> 08:18.618
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT A RELIEF IT WAS

08:18.730 --> 08:21.028
TO WALK IN HERE
AND SIT DOWN.

08:21.130 --> 08:22.859
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:22.970 --> 08:25.325
OH, HE STARTED ANOTHER
ROUND OF ELECTROSHOCK,

08:25.430 --> 08:28.638
BECAUSE GEORGE AND MAGGIE
THINK IT HELPS.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.662
BUT THE DAYS
AFTER THE TREATMENTS ARE

08:30.770 --> 08:32.806
SUCH A CHALLENGE FOR ME.

08:32.910 --> 08:36.129
HE COMES HOME SO SCA'I'I'ERED.
IT'S LIKE DEALING
WITH A SLEEPWALKER.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.243
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU FIND THE STRENGTH
TO DEAL WITH IT.

08:39.350 --> 08:41.716
CLEARLY, I DON'T EITHER.

08:41.820 --> 08:44.345
HAVE YOU SIGNED UP
FOR NEXT WEEK'S CLASS?

08:44.450 --> 08:46.281
I HAVEN'T YET, NO.

08:46.390 --> 08:49.484
OH, RUTH, YOU MUST.
YOU'RE THE ONLY VERSION
OF MY MOTHER

08:49.590 --> 08:52.184
- I CAN TALK TO.
- I'LL TRY AND MAKE IT.

08:54.530 --> 08:56.259
IT'S ALL GOOD, RIGHT?

08:56.360 --> 08:58.965
YEAH, IT IS.

09:02.270 --> 09:04.158
WELL, I HAVE
ERRANDS TO RUN,

09:04.270 --> 09:06.875
AND MAGGIE'S WAITING.

09:07.440 --> 09:10.204
Both: BYE.

09:11.210 --> 09:13.519
( chuckles )

09:13.620 --> 09:16.589
( traffic humming )

09:16.690 --> 09:18.817
( whimpers )

09:28.000 --> 09:31.766
LILA WAS
THE MOST ACTIVE PERSON
I EVER MET IN MY LIFE.

09:31.870 --> 09:34.759
I MEAN,
I TRY TO STAY BUSY

09:34.870 --> 09:37.236
WITH BRIDGE
AND THE ANGELS.

09:37.340 --> 09:39.262
I'M A BIG ANGEL FAN.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.736
- I CAN SEE THAT.
- BUT LILA,

09:41.840 --> 09:44.547
SHE WAS
A RUNAWAY TRAIN!

09:44.650 --> 09:46.971
IT'S SO HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT SHE WON'T BE OUTSIDE

09:47.080 --> 09:50.083
MESSING AROUND
WITH HER FLOWERS
WHEN I GET HOME.

09:50.190 --> 09:53.512
ARE YOU SURE
SHE NEVER MARRIED
OR HAD ANY CHILDREN?

09:53.620 --> 09:55.417
OH, SHE WAS GOING TO,

09:55.520 --> 09:58.523
BUT HER BEAU DIED
VERY YOUNG.

09:58.630 --> 10:01.758
AFI'ER THAT
SHE RAN A RESORT

10:01.860 --> 10:04.966
UP IN OJAI
ALL ON HER OWN.

10:05.070 --> 10:07.891
THERE WERE FAMILIES
THAT CAME THERE EVERY YEAR,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.468
AND THEN
THEIR KIDS WOULD COME

10:10.570 --> 10:12.458
AND THEIR KIDS
WOULD COME

10:12.570 --> 10:15.277
AND THEY ALL
KEPT UP WITH HER.

10:15.380 --> 10:17.473
NO ONE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

10:17.580 --> 10:20.572
GOT MORE CHRISTMAS CARDS
OR VISITS THAN LILA.

10:20.680 --> 10:24.639
- SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD LIFE.
- IT WAS.

10:24.750 --> 10:28.015
TODAY WOULD HAVE BEEN
HER 95TH BIRTHDAY.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.758
HMM.

10:30.590 --> 10:33.354
WHAT?

10:33.460 --> 10:36.349
WELL, TODAY IS
HIS BIRTHDAY TOO.

10:36.460 --> 10:39.623
OH, HOW OLD ARE YOU?

10:39.740 --> 10:43.437
- I'M 40.
- OH, YOU DON'T LOOK
THAT OLD.

10:43.540 --> 10:45.007
THANK YOU.

10:45.110 --> 10:47.704
- ARE YOU DOING
SOMETHING SPECIAL?
- NOT TODAY,

10:47.810 --> 10:49.698
BUT MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER
ARE GONNA TAKE ME

10:49.810 --> 10:51.641
UP TO BIG SUR
NEXT WEEKEND.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.878
OH. BIG SUR.

10:55.880 --> 10:58.986
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
UP THERE.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.889
SO STUNNING!

11:07.930 --> 11:11.127
I SUPPOSE I'LL BE
GONE SOON TOO.

11:11.230 --> 11:13.790
_ OH--
- I WILL.

11:14.770 --> 11:17.364
THAT'S OKAY.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.371
IT HAPPENS.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.304
COULDN'T YOU SAY,
"ROGER, MY PARTNER AND I

11:24.410 --> 11:26.674
PLAN TO SPEND THE MORNING
TOGETHER, I CAN'T PICK UP

11:26.780 --> 11:28.873
- YOUR CAT AT THE VET"?
- DAVID, LET IT GO.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.948
WHY CAN'T HE GET ONE OF HIS
ABERCROMBIE & FITCH

11:31.050 --> 11:33.189
PARTY BOYS TO DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

11:33.290 --> 11:34.917
YOU'RE A BODYGUARD,

11:35.020 --> 11:37.784
AND I'D LIKE
TO GET TO WORK
AT SOME POINT TODAY.

11:37.890 --> 11:39.380
DO YOU LIKE
YOUR NEW PLASMA TV?

11:39.490 --> 11:41.549
( sighs )
I DO.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.662
THEN LET IT GO.

11:43.770 --> 11:46.159
- ( doorbell rings )
- THAT CAT STINKS.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.397
KEITH CHARLES!

11:48.500 --> 11:51.708
- AND YOU MUST BE DAVID!
- YES.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.698
SISSY PASQUESE.

11:53.810 --> 11:56.131
COME ON IN.
ROGER'S MAKING KIR ROYALES.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.277
- SISTER?
- I DON'T KNOW.

11:59.380 --> 12:02.076
- THE KIDS ARE ALMOST READY.
- KIDS? EX-WIFE?

12:02.180 --> 12:04.387
- I DON'T KNOW!
- HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW?

12:04.490 --> 12:06.446
DAVID,
WE'RE MARRIED,

12:06.550 --> 12:07.983
ROGER'S GAY,
AND I'M FINE WITH IT.

12:08.090 --> 12:11.025
BUT WE KEEP IT QUIET,
BECAUSE WE'RE VERY
PRIVATE PEOPLE.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.394
THANK YOU.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.458
- THAT'S ALL I NEEDED.
- HONEY, GUESS WHO'S HERE.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.222
- ( machinery humming )
- ( phone ringing )

12:24.740 --> 12:26.662
- HELLO.
- Woman: Mr. Diaz?

12:26.780 --> 12:28.475
YES, WHO IS THIS?

12:28.580 --> 12:31.105
AGNES, I WORK
FOR THE CAMPBELLS.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.746
JULIO CAME HOME
WITH LUCAS AFTER SCHOOL.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.943
Oh. Yeah?

12:35.050 --> 12:37.041
WELL, HE KIND OF NEEDS
TO BE PICKED UP.

12:37.150 --> 12:39.983
OH, OKAY,
MY WIFE VAN ESSA

12:40.090 --> 12:41.819
SHOULD BE THERE
IN A LITTLE BIT, I THINK.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.956
No, we called her
like 10 times,

12:44.060 --> 12:46.028
and she's not answering
her phone or something,

12:46.130 --> 12:49.998
and the Campbells left
for Arrowhead like
an hour ago.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.364
I'M SORRY.
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.665
- ( purring )
- AND I TOLD ROGER
10 YEARS AGO,

12:56.770 --> 12:58.931
"ROGER, I WANT OUT
OF THIS GODDAMN L.A.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.133
IT'S A PLAGUE.
I WANT TO GO HOME."

13:01.240 --> 13:04.505
- ( jazz music playing )
- I HAVEN'T BEEN
BACK HERE SINCE,

13:04.610 --> 13:06.840
sEEXCEPT FOR TWO-DAY TRIP,
THREE-DAY TRIPS, RIGHT?

13:06.950 --> 13:08.747
I MISS HER
WHEN SHE'S GONE.

13:08.850 --> 13:11.148
I'M AN ASPEN GIRL,
WHAT CAN I SAY?

13:11.250 --> 13:13.013
SO, WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO TOWN?

13:13.120 --> 13:15.953
A PEDUNCULATED FIBROID.

13:16.060 --> 13:18.756
SHIT FOR ME, HUH?

13:18.860 --> 13:22.023
AND TATE AND ENZO
NEED HAIRCUTS.

13:22.130 --> 13:25.224
SO, ROGER TELLS ME
YOU TWO ARE THINKING
OF ADOPTING.

13:25.330 --> 13:27.469
LOOKS LIKE THAT'S NOT
HAPPENING ANYMORE.

13:27.570 --> 13:30.232
BECAUSE YOU BIT ROGER?

13:30.340 --> 13:32.501
NO.

13:32.610 --> 13:33.907
IT GOT COMPLICATED.

13:34.010 --> 13:36.069
SHIT FOR YOU GUYS, HUH?

13:38.110 --> 13:40.510
KEITH, YOU THINK
YOU COULD RUN THE KIDS
BY LAISSEZ-FAIRE

13:40.620 --> 13:42.611
WHILE I TAKE SISSY
TO THE DOCTOR?

13:42.720 --> 13:44.210
UH, WE ACTUALLY
HAVE AN ERRAND

13:44.320 --> 13:47.050
THAT WE NEED TO RUN
AT SOME POINT.

13:48.290 --> 13:51.327
IT'S ON THE WAY.
WE'LL TAKE THEM.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.898
Roger: THANKS.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.956
HONEY, THE CAT
STILL REEKS.

13:56.060 --> 13:59.268
Roger:
I KNOW, I KNOW.

13:59.370 --> 14:02.294
Jackie: PEOPLE DO THINGS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
THAT'S OKAY.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.038
WELL, I DON'T WANT HIM
TO DO IT JUST FOR ME.

14:04.140 --> 14:06.108
- WHY THE HELL NOT?
- BECAUSE I WANT HIM

14:06.210 --> 14:08.030
TO WANT TO HAVE
OUR BABY,

14:08.140 --> 14:09.801
NOT TO DO ME THE FAVOR
OF LE'I'I'ING ME HAVE MINE.

14:09.910 --> 14:12.504
DON'T BE WEIRDER
ABOUT THIS THAN YOU
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO BE.

14:12.610 --> 14:14.510
BUT HE SHOULD
WANT TO HAVE THIS
AS MUCH AS I DO.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.815
- HE HAS MAYA ALREADY.
- NO, IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.979
THEN MAYBE HE'S AFRAID
OF LOSING ANOTHER ONE.

14:19.090 --> 14:20.819
YOU KNOW?
AND ANYWAY,

14:20.920 --> 14:23.787
LET'S SAY HE IS
DOING IT JUST FOR YOU.
IS THAT SO TERRIBLE?

14:23.890 --> 14:25.687
WE HAD SYLVIA

14:25.790 --> 14:28.020
FOR ALL THE PERFECT
BOTH-OF-US REASONS,

14:28.130 --> 14:30.121
AND I HAD JOSH FOR MARK,

14:30.230 --> 14:32.892
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T IMAGINE
LIFE WITHOUT A BOY.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.230
I WAS HAPPY WITH ONE.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.860
CAN YOU NOT TELL ANYONE
ABOUT THE PREGNANCY?

14:38.970 --> 14:40.528
- FUCK YOU.
- NO, I WANT
TO WAIT THIS TIME

14:40.640 --> 14:42.904
UNTIL I KNOW
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT.

14:43.010 --> 14:44.875
BRENDA, STOP.

14:44.980 --> 14:47.619
I SWEAR, SOMETIMES YOU'RE
LIKE EEYORE.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.676
CHECK IT OUT.

14:49.780 --> 14:51.611
OH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

14:51.720 --> 14:55.087
10,000 TO GO.

14:55.190 --> 14:57.226
Agnes:
BUT JASON IS ONLY IN TOWN
FOR TONIGHT, CHARESE.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.423
YOU HAVE TO BE THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

14:59.530 --> 15:02.226
YOU HAVE TO!
HE JUST GOT DONE WITH BASIC,

15:02.330 --> 15:04.764
AND HE'S GOING, LIKE,
IN TWO DAYS!

15:04.870 --> 15:06.895
THEN GET OFF WORK.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.139
I'M TRYING!

15:09.240 --> 15:11.834
I'M LEAVING
AS SOON AS I CAN.

15:11.940 --> 15:13.498
DON'T GET A TONE
WITH ME

15:13.610 --> 15:15.771
WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN GET
YOUR BUT!" OUT OF PIZZA HUT.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.678
OH, HEY, MR. DIAZ.
NO, I SAID THE 110.

15:18.780 --> 15:20.941
- COME ON, LET'S GO HOME.
- THE 110 TO THE 710.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.711
STOP FOR A SECOND
AND LISTEN TO ME.

15:22.820 --> 15:25.186
I'M GIVING YOU
THE DIRECTIONS.
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!

15:25.290 --> 15:27.679
Woman on machine:
Next new message:

15:27.790 --> 15:30.020
- today at 2:54 PM.
- ( rock music playing
on radio )

15:30.130 --> 15:32.121
Claire, it's Billy.

15:32.230 --> 15:34.289
Uh, sorry about this morning.
( chuckles )

15:34.400 --> 15:36.925
Give me a call.

15:37.030 --> 15:39.419
( beeps )

15:39.530 --> 15:41.691
Woman on machine:
Next new message:

15:41.800 --> 15:44.337
today at 2:58 PM.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.931
Billy:
Claire, hey, it's me.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.928
Are you still at Amoeba?
Because if you are,

15:49.040 --> 15:51.076
I really need to hear
some Brian Eno today,

15:51.180 --> 15:53.011
or I'm going
to tear my eyes out.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.543
OH, SHUT UP.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.242
Woman:
Next new message:

15:57.350 --> 15:59.386
-today at 3:01--
- OH.

15:59.490 --> 16:03.324
PLEASE, GET A LIFE
FOR ONE MINUTE, PLEASE!

16:03.430 --> 16:05.557
( sighs )

16:08.030 --> 16:10.624
DO YOU GUYS HAVE WIVES
BESIDES BEING GAY?

16:11.270 --> 16:13.693
NO.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.893
WE'RE A MARRIED COUPLE,
ESSENTIALLY.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.763
WELL, WHEN OUR DAD
MARRIED OUR MOM,

16:17.870 --> 16:20.373
HE WAS COMPLETELY
HOMOSEXUAL IN HIS
ORIENTATION.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.232
ONLY HE WAS IN SUCH
DENIAL ABOUT IT

16:22.340 --> 16:24.274
BECAUSE OF THE SOCIAL
PRESSURE, IT WAS LIKE

16:24.380 --> 16:27.269
- HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE WAS GAY.
- THAT HAPPENS.

16:27.380 --> 16:30.440
WELL, IT WASN'T
UNTIL HE BECAME A SUCCESS
IN HIS CHOSEN FIELD

16:30.550 --> 16:33.383
THAT HIS EGO FELT,
YOU KNOW, STRONG ENOUGH
TO FACE THE TRUTH.

16:33.490 --> 16:36.880
DO YOU EVER HAVE SEX
WITH CHICKS?

16:36.990 --> 16:39.754
- I DON'T.
- SO, YOU DO?

16:41.160 --> 16:43.822
I'VE HAD SEX
WITH A FEW WOMEN.

16:43.930 --> 16:46.319
- HAVE YOU HAD
SEX WITH OUR DAD?
- YOU ARE KIND OF HIS TYPE.

16:46.430 --> 16:48.569
- DO YOU GUYS HAVE ORGIES?
- OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

16:48.670 --> 16:51.332
NO MORE TALKING
UNTIL WE GET TO THE SALON.

16:52.210 --> 16:55.998
THEY HAVE ORGIES.

16:56.110 --> 16:57.907
- HE WAS WAITING
WITH THAT GIRL...
- I'M SORRY.

16:58.010 --> 17:00.740
- ...FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR!
- THEY WERE GONNA BE THERE
UNTIL 4:00.

17:00.850 --> 17:03.045
- THEY LEFI' EARLY,
AND SHE CALLED YOU.
- MY PHONE DIDN'T RING.

17:03.150 --> 17:05.880
- OH, BULLSHIT.
- DON'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT SHIT HAPPENS.

17:05.990 --> 17:08.652
I DON'T HAVE
TO PRETEND ANYTHING.
THE WAY IT IS IS BAD ENOUGH.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.729
- IF WE WERE STILL TOGETHER--
- OH, THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN?
BULLSHIT!

17:11.830 --> 17:14.219
- IT WOULD HAPPEN LESS!
- REALLY? WHAT A GOOD POINT.

17:14.330 --> 17:15.991
I KNOW IT'S ALL
MY FAULT, VANESSA.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.829
WHENEVER ANYTHING
GOES WRONG WITH THE BOYS

17:17.930 --> 17:20.137
FROM NOW UNTIL THE END OF TIME
IT WILL BE BECAUSE I WENT OUT

17:20.240 --> 17:22.663
AND FUCKED SOME WHORE, OKAY?
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW!

17:23.910 --> 17:27.539
- LOOK.
- WHAT?

17:27.640 --> 17:31.542
YOU WANNA
HANG OUT FOR A WHILE?
YOU WANNA STAY FOR DINNER?

17:34.350 --> 17:36.341
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO
TO THIS, UM--

17:36.450 --> 17:38.179
BUT YOU KNOW,
I CAN CALL AND CHANGE IT.

17:38.290 --> 17:39.939
NO, YOU'RE NOT
DOING ME ANY FAVORS.

17:40.050 --> 17:43.554
OH, GOD, I DIDN'T
SAY I WAS DOING YOU
ANY FAVORS. SHIT.

17:43.660 --> 17:46.288
- ( dance music playing )
- Enzo: I'M FEELING
PRETTY SECURE NOW,

17:46.390 --> 17:48.358
BUT I WENT
THROUGH A PHASE LAST YEAR

17:48.460 --> 17:50.428
WHERE, YOU KNOW,
I WAS SO SHY AROUND CHICKS

17:50.530 --> 17:52.669
THAT I THOUGHT
MAYBE I WAS GAY, TOO.

17:52.770 --> 17:55.466
I THINK IT'S PRETTY NORMAL
TO GO THROUGH A PHASE
LIKE THAT.

17:55.570 --> 17:57.333
YEAH IT IS,

17:57.440 --> 17:59.465
BUT THEN WE HAD
SOME GROUP SESSIONS

17:59.570 --> 18:02.471
WITH OUR THERAPISTS AND DAD,
AND IT TURNED OUT

18:02.580 --> 18:04.844
WHAT I WAS REALLY
AFRAID OF WAS
NOT BEING GAY.

18:04.950 --> 18:07.817
I MEAN, IF I WASN'T GAY,

18:07.920 --> 18:09.774
WOULD DAD STILL LOVE ME?

18:09.880 --> 18:12.087
SO, THAT CLEARED IT UP.

18:12.190 --> 18:14.181
I'M NOT GAY, AND I HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND IN ASPEN.

18:14.290 --> 18:18.386
- OH, WHAT'S HER NAME?
- ALISON. SHE'S BI.

18:18.490 --> 18:20.993
KEITH, DOES THIS LOOK
COMPLETELY DEVIANT?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.591
NO! LOOKS GOOD.

18:23.700 --> 18:26.294
- ( David sighs )
- WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.563
THANK YOU.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.661
MY MOM HAS A FRIEND
BACK HOME NAMED VERNON,

18:31.770 --> 18:34.933
BUT SHE DOESN'T FEEL
LIKE HE'D BE A GOOD
SEXUAL PARTNER FOR HER.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.678
I HAVE TO SAY
I KIND OF AGREE.

18:36.780 --> 18:38.873
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I'M GONNA STAY HERE

18:38.980 --> 18:41.915
AND GET A HAIRCUT
WHILE YOU TAKE THESE TWO
BACK HOME.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.681
- IF THAT'S OKAY.
- SURE.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.042
I'LL COME BACK
AND PICK YOU UP
AFTER I DROP THE KIDS OFF.

18:46.150 --> 18:49.153
THAN KS.

18:49.260 --> 18:52.388
- SO HOW IS HE DOING?
- NOT GREAT.

18:52.490 --> 18:55.220
HE'S BEEN ASKING TO GO DOWN
TO THE BOMB SHELTER AGAIN.

18:55.330 --> 18:57.924
I DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

18:58.030 --> 18:59.895
I TOLD HIM
I WOULD ASK YOU.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.537
NO, I DON'T
WANT TO RISK GOING
TH ROUGH ALL THAT AGAIN.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.165
WE SHOULD
BOARD THAT PLACE UP
AND FORGET IT'S THERE.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.101
MAYBE IT WOULD BE
GOOD FOR HIM

19:07.210 --> 19:09.371
- TO HAVE S|\(l)C'J/'EWHERE"

19:09.480 --> 19:11.675
( man speaking on TV)

19:23.430 --> 19:25.250
DID YOU HAVE A NICE TIME
OUT IN THE WORLD?

19:25.360 --> 19:28.227
I DID. IT WAS
A VERY NICE DAY,
THANK YOU.

19:33.970 --> 19:36.063
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

19:36.170 --> 19:38.536
THAN KS.

19:44.450 --> 19:47.271
THE DAY I TURNED 40
YOU WERE IN EUROPE.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.940
I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY
WONDERING IF YOU'D CALL.

19:51.450 --> 19:52.610
SORRY.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.257
DON'T APOLOGIZE,
YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.487
YOU LITTLE FUCKER.

19:59.660 --> 20:01.890
SO MUCH CRAZY SHIT
HAS HAPPENED

20:02.000 --> 20:03.968
SINCE THESE PICTURES
WERE TAKEN.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.822
SO MUCH.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.333
THE IDEA
OF 40 MORE YEARS--

20:10.440 --> 20:13.568
OH, BUT THE NEXT 40
FLY BY MUCH FASTER.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.103
IT WILL BE OVER
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

20:16.210 --> 20:18.041
TIME FLIES WHEN YOU'RE
HAVING FUN, HUH?

20:18.150 --> 20:20.641
NO, HUH-UH.

20:20.750 --> 20:23.583
TIME FLIES WHEN YOU'RE
PRETENDING TO HAVE FUN.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.488
TIME FLIES WHEN YOU'RE
PRETENDING TO LOVE BRENDA

20:26.590 --> 20:28.717
AND THAT BABY
SHE WANTS SO MUCH.

20:28.820 --> 20:30.924
TIME FLIES WHEN YOU'RE
PRETENDING TO KNOW

20:31.030 --> 20:33.521
WHAT PEOPLE MEAN
WHEN THEY SAY...

20:33.630 --> 20:35.757
"LOVE."

20:37.230 --> 20:38.595
LET'S FACE IT,
BUDDY BOY,

20:38.700 --> 20:40.668
THERE'S TWO KINDS
OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD--

20:40.770 --> 20:42.590
THERE'S YOU AND
THERE'S EVERYBODY ELSE,

20:42.700 --> 20:46.500
AND NEVER
THE TWAIN SHALL MEAT.

20:46.610 --> 20:49.602
- ( phone ringing )
- ( sighs )

20:49.710 --> 20:51.644
TAKE IT.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.911
I GOT TIME.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.454
- HEY.
- Brenda: Hey.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.516
What are you doing?

21:02.620 --> 21:04.929
STILL AT WORK.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

21:05.030 --> 21:06.918
YEAH, EVERYTHING IS FINE.

21:07.030 --> 21:10.522
- How's the baby?
- WELL, I HAVEN'T LOST IT

21:10.630 --> 21:12.825
since this morning,
if that's what you're asking.

21:12.930 --> 21:14.363
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

21:14.470 --> 21:16.734
COULD YOU STOP BY WHOLE FOODS
ON THE WAY HOME

21:16.840 --> 21:18.637
AND PICK UP SOME
CHOCOLATE SILK FOR MAYA?

21:18.740 --> 21:21.174
- YEAH, SURE.
- And can you call me
from there

21:21.280 --> 21:23.202
in case I've forgotten
anything?

21:23.310 --> 21:24.902
YEP.

21:25.010 --> 21:27.672
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA
COME HOME TO SOME
BIG FIGHT, AM I?

21:27.780 --> 21:29.145
NO.

21:29.250 --> 21:31.138
ALL RIGHT.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.786
- Bye.
- BYE.

21:32.890 --> 21:34.915
Man on TV:
It's not the size
of the animal

21:35.020 --> 21:37.329
that makes it deadly,
it's the size of its mouth.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.022
The bigger the mouth--

21:39.130 --> 21:41.519
- ( dance music playing )
- AND THEN WE GO TO THE VET,

21:41.630 --> 21:44.019
AND THEN BACK TO THE HOUSE,
AND THEN ALL OVER
BEVERLY HILLS,

21:44.130 --> 21:46.166
AND THEN FINALLY
WE COME HERE.

21:46.270 --> 21:50.229
IT'S LIKE HIS JOB
CAME AND FOUND MY DAY
AND ATE IT.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.433
WELL, I LEARNED
WHEN I WAS A KID--

21:52.540 --> 21:55.304
DON'T GO TO WORK WITH DAD,
IT'S NEVER FUN.

21:59.350 --> 22:01.318
BUT SAYING NO IS

22:01.420 --> 22:03.274
THE HARDEST THING
IN THE WORLD.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.984
- AT LEAST FOR ME.
- ME TOO.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.737
- JUST WAIT A SECOND.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

22:24.840 --> 22:27.900
I DON'T THINK
I SHOULD DO THIS.

22:29.510 --> 22:31.808
- ALL RIGHT.
- I MEAN, YOU SEEM
REALLY NICE...

22:31.910 --> 22:34.470
- THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
- ...BUT KEITH AND I ARE
DOING THIS WHOLE

22:34.580 --> 22:36.719
SURROGACY THING,
IT'S REALLY CONFUSING,
AND HARD,

22:36.820 --> 22:39.186
- AND PLUS I GOT LIKE
ABDUCT ED LAST YEAR--
- OKAY, DAVID,

22:39.290 --> 22:41.349
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.554
JUST STAY IN HERE
A SECOND.

22:44.660 --> 22:46.981
GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER.

23:17.320 --> 23:20.426
SURPRISE!
( laughing )

23:20.530 --> 23:22.896
HAPPY BIRTH DAY!

23:24.900 --> 23:26.663
HAPPY BIRTH DAY.

23:26.770 --> 23:29.068
- HEY, THANK YOU
- GIVE DADDY A KISS.

23:32.610 --> 23:35.170
"OH LORDY, NATE'S 40."
IS THAT YOUR IDEA?

23:35.280 --> 23:37.168
THIS IS JACKIE
FROM WORK.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.305
- OH, FAMILY DINNER JACKIE.
- YES.

23:39.410 --> 23:41.913
- HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

23:42.020 --> 23:45.148
Nate:
SO THE BIG SUR THING WAS
JUST A RUSE, HUH?

23:45.250 --> 23:48.219
- WHY, ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED?
- NO NO NO, NOT AT ALL.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.550
- YOU NEED A BEER.
- YEAH, A BEER
WOULD BE GREAT.

23:50.660 --> 23:52.787
MAZEL TOV, BY THE WAY,
ON THE BABY.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.858

23:56.660 --> 23:58.218
THANK YOU, GOD,
FOR THIS FOOD.

23:58.330 --> 24:01.390
- AMEN.
- AMEN.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.331
THAT'S IT?

24:03.440 --> 24:05.829
"THANK YOU, GOD,
FOR THIS FOOD. AMEN"?

24:05.940 --> 24:07.874
YEAH.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.709
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO "BLESS US, O LORD,

24:09.810 --> 24:11.698
AND THESE THY GIFTS
WHICH WE ARE ABOUT
TO RECEIVE"?

24:11.810 --> 24:15.849
- WE SHORTENED IT UP.
DIDN'T WE?
- MM-HMM.

24:15.950 --> 24:19.886
- ARE WE SURE IT'S RIGHT?
- YEAH, WE ARE.

24:19.990 --> 24:22.151
WANT SOME FRITOS?

24:24.130 --> 24:26.189
BREAKFAST IN BED.

24:28.730 --> 24:30.869
NO, THANK YOU, PAPITO.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.791
I'M GOOD.

24:33.900 --> 24:35.993
- ( quiet music playing )
- RUTH, WOULD YOU LIKE

24:36.100 --> 24:39.706
- A REFILL FOR THAT?
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

24:39.810 --> 24:42.631
Todd:
WE'RE RIGHT
IN THE BOONDOCKS, OKAY?

24:42.740 --> 24:44.970
PRETTY SOON I HAD STARTED
TURNING INTO SOCIAL EVENTS

24:45.080 --> 24:47.640
DURING THE WEEK,
AND I'D BE CRANKING ALONG,

24:47.750 --> 24:49.672
AND SHE'D BE LIKE,
"IT'S KIND OF JUST US, TODD,

24:49.780 --> 24:51.816
IT'S JUST THE CLUB."
NEXT THING I KNOW

24:51.920 --> 24:53.854
SHE'S FUCKING THIS GUY
WITH NUT CANCER.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.485
- JESUS!
- YEAH, SHE'S FUCKING
LANCE ARMSTRONG.

24:56.590 --> 24:58.785
NO! SHE'S FUCKING
LANCE ARMSTRONG?!

24:58.890 --> 25:00.699
NO NO, OF COURSE NOT,
BUT IN ESSENCE, YEAH,

25:00.800 --> 25:02.893
- SHE'S FUCKING
LANCE ARC'J/IHSTRONG'

25:03.000 --> 25:05.468
HERE'S THE KEEPER, THOUGH.
THIS DIVORCE IS
THE BEST THING

25:05.570 --> 25:07.697
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.
I'VE HAD MORE ASS

25:07.800 --> 25:09.563
IN THE LAST YEAR
THAN I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE.

25:09.670 --> 25:11.809
( laughs )
I HATE YOU.

25:11.910 --> 25:14.435
MORAL OF THE STORY--
40 IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.

25:14.540 --> 25:16.201
IT'S JUST
THE FUCKING BEGINNING.

25:16.310 --> 25:19.108
- HERE'S HOW, MAN.
- CHEERS.

25:19.210 --> 25:22.213
I USED TO MOUNTAIN BIKE
IN GRIFFITH PARK,

25:22.320 --> 25:23.947
AND I SAW
THIS GUY ONCE

25:24.050 --> 25:26.644
- WHO HAD TOTALLY
ENDO'D, YOU KNOW?
- UH-HUH.

25:26.750 --> 25:28.786
AND HE WAS LAYING
12 FUCKING FEET
FROM HIS BIKE.

25:28.890 --> 25:31.654
HIS BALL SACK WAS
COMPLETELY RIPPED OPEN.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.923
IT WAS LIKE, UH,
TWO PINK EGGS

25:35.030 --> 25:36.520
KIND OF VIBRATING

25:36.630 --> 25:38.291
IN THIS TOTALLY
SHREDDED MESS.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.322
- IT WAS INSANE.
- ( knocks )

25:40.430 --> 25:42.660
- FUCK.
- JESUS, BILLY.

25:42.770 --> 25:44.601
- WHAT THE FUCK, MAN?
- NO, I WAS JUST THINKING

25:44.710 --> 25:46.439
ABOUT THE GUY
WITH NUT CANCER.

25:46.540 --> 25:48.303
- YEAH, I GOT YOU.
- OH, YEAH.

25:48.410 --> 25:51.402
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

25:51.510 --> 25:53.000
HE HAD TO GET
A HAIRCUT.

25:53.110 --> 25:57.012
- WHAT, FOR THIS?
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.145
- WELL, IT LOOKS GOOD,
I GUESS.
- THANKS.

25:59.250 --> 26:02.310
SO HOW LONG HAVE
YOU TWO FUCKERS KNOWN
ABOUT THIS?

26:02.420 --> 26:04.058
COUPLE OF WEEKS.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.980
YEAH, WHAT ELSE
AREN'T YOU TELLING ME?

26:06.090 --> 26:07.318
NOTHING.

26:07.430 --> 26:09.694
- WHAT?
- I THINK IT'S CAKE TIME.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.427
- HEY, DID YOU
MEET HIM, MAN?
- MEET WHO?

26:11.530 --> 26:14.738
- LANCE ARMSTRONG.
- DUDE, I WAS SPEAKING
METAPHORICALLY.

26:14.840 --> 26:18.139
OH, GOD, WHERE DID YOU GUYS
GET THIS AMAZING CAKE?

26:18.240 --> 26:20.333
THIS CUBAN PLACE
IN ATWATER.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.704
PORTO'S. IT'S IN GLENDALE.

26:22.810 --> 26:26.849
LIGHT FROM A CAKE
IS SUCH A GREAT LIGHT.

26:26.950 --> 26:29.145
WE SHOULD JUST LIVE
IN CAKE LIGHT.

26:29.250 --> 26:33.448
YEAH, OKAY, HERE WE GO.

26:33.550 --> 26:37.259
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

26:37.360 --> 26:40.329

26:40.430 --> 26:44.594

DEAR NATE *

26:44.700 --> 26:49.194

26:49.300 --> 26:52.565
( cheering )

26:52.670 --> 26:55.138
COME ON, MAKE A WISH.

27:03.450 --> 27:06.749
SPEECH SPEECH SPEECH!

27:08.920 --> 27:11.787
- NO.
- AW, COME ON, MAN.

27:11.890 --> 27:14.154
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
SERIOUSLY, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO SAY

27:14.260 --> 27:16.228
YOU KNOW, THAT WOULDN'T
SOUND LAME.

27:16.330 --> 27:18.298
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.197
PLEASE.

27:20.300 --> 27:24.600
IT IS THE MOST DIFFICULT
THING IN THE WORLD

27:24.710 --> 27:27.531
TO WATCH YOUR CHILDREN
GROW UP AND MOVE ON.

27:27.640 --> 27:30.529
AND WHEN YOU LEFT HOME,
MY FIRSTBORN,

27:30.640 --> 27:32.642
- I WAS VERY SAD.
- HERE WE GO.

27:32.750 --> 27:35.275
THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU!

27:40.890 --> 27:44.587
THESE PAST FIVE YEARS
WITH YOU HAVE BEEN
A GIFT, NATE.

27:44.690 --> 27:46.749
THAT'S ALL I WANTED
TO SAY. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

27:46.860 --> 27:49.090
THANK YOU, MOM.

27:59.170 --> 28:02.003
WELL, I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING TO SAY
TO ADD TO THAT,

28:02.110 --> 28:04.146
SO, UH...

28:04.250 --> 28:06.400
( sighs )

28:09.150 --> 28:11.141
CAN I TELL 'EM?

28:14.220 --> 28:17.280
YOU'RE PREGNANT?

28:20.160 --> 28:23.698
UH... YEAH.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.165
Tom:
FANTASTIC!

28:25.270 --> 28:27.465
- CONGRATULATIONS, MY MAN.
- THANK YOU.

28:27.570 --> 28:29.868
THAT'S GREAT.
CONGRATULATIONS.

28:29.970 --> 28:31.938
- ( glass shattering )
- WHAT THE FUCK?

28:32.040 --> 28:34.133
- WAIT, WHERE'S MAYA?
- I'VE GOT HER.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.401
Keith:
SOUNDS LIKE
SOMETHING FELL.

28:36.510 --> 28:39.149
( caws )

28:39.250 --> 28:43.141
- HOW DID IT GET IN?
- THROUGH THE WINDOW.

28:43.250 --> 28:45.286
SO BLUE.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.915
- IT'S A GOOD OMEN.
- SCI-FI CHANNEL SAYS
IT'S A BAD OMEN.

28:48.020 --> 28:50.409
- IT'S NOT AN OMEN.
IT'S A BIRD.
- AMEN.

28:50.520 --> 28:54.149
- NO, OMEN,
IT'S PRONOUNCED OMEN.
- THANKS.

28:54.260 --> 28:57.457
BIRDS DON'T
USUALLY FLY AT NIGHT.
IT'S PROBABLY SICK.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.892
DO YOU THINK
IT HAS AVIAN FLU?

29:00.000 --> 29:03.163
OBVIOUSLY, WE DON'T KNOW.
JUST OPEN THE WINDOW,

29:03.270 --> 29:05.204
CLOSE THE DOOR,
AND IT'LL FIND
ITS OWN WAY OUT.

29:05.310 --> 29:07.835
- BUT HE'LL POOP ALL OVER
EVERYTHING IRVUTTH'T MEANTIME.

29:07.940 --> 29:09.498
WELL, SERIOUSLY,
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT,

29:09.610 --> 29:11.976
TO LET A SICK BIRD
RUN WILD IN THE HOUSE
POOPING?

29:12.080 --> 29:15.174
YOU KNOW WHAT, MOM?
I THINK GEORGE IS RIGHT.
I AM JUST GONNA...

29:15.280 --> 29:17.339
OPEN THE WINDOW.

29:17.450 --> 29:20.886
- ( cawing )
- I'M GONNA OPEN THIS DOOR.

29:23.790 --> 29:27.055
SOMEBODY CLOSE THAT DOOR.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.856
- HEY, NATE,
GRAB THE BEER, OKAY?
- YEAH, I'LL GRAB THE BEER, TOM.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.825
- THANK YOU.
- David: IT'S
A BEAUTIFUL BIRD.

29:31.930 --> 29:35.093
GOD, IT'S FUCKING
CERULEAN.

29:35.200 --> 29:39.534
SO LET'S JUST
CLOSE THIS DOOR

29:39.640 --> 29:41.608
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

29:41.710 --> 29:43.905
( cawing )

29:46.350 --> 29:47.647
JESUS.

29:47.750 --> 29:51.208
- THANKS FOR
LETTING ME STAY.
- SURE.

29:51.320 --> 29:54.858
I HAVEN'T PUT THE BOYS
TO BED FOR AWHILE.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.951
I MISS THAT.

29:57.060 --> 29:59.881
YEAH, THEY MISS IT TOO.

30:13.610 --> 30:17.478
( rock music
playing faintly)

30:17.580 --> 30:19.639
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30:19.750 --> 30:21.615
I GOTTA GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.449
WHY?

30:23.550 --> 30:26.781
I JUST DO.
WE'LL CRUISE MULHOLLAND.
WE'LL GO TO THE LOOKOUT.

30:26.890 --> 30:28.482
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO GO.

30:28.590 --> 30:31.320
IT'S MY BROTHER'S BIRTHDAY.
THERE'S A BIRD IN THE KITCHEN.

30:31.430 --> 30:34.354
ISN'T BEING WITH OTHER
PEOPLE EVER TOO MUCH
FOR YOU TO DEAL WITH?

30:34.460 --> 30:36.599
YEAH, LIKE RIGHT NOW.

30:38.830 --> 30:40.695
( cawing )

30:40.800 --> 30:42.392
( feathers ruffling )

30:42.500 --> 30:44.365
LOOK, THERE IT IS.

30:44.470 --> 30:46.768
- David: SHOO IT
OUT THE WINDOW.
- Keith: WAIT A SECOND.

30:46.870 --> 30:49.839
- DON'T TOUCH IT.
- DAVID, SHUT UP.

31:03.590 --> 31:05.626
GOOD JOB.

31:09.530 --> 31:12.863
- YOU'RE NOT COMING?
- NO, I ALREADY
TOLD YOU THAT.

31:13.830 --> 31:16.162
HERE.
YOU KEEP THE CAR.

31:16.270 --> 31:19.000
- YOU CAN'T WALK HOME.
- WELL, IF IT'S TOO FAR,
I'LL TAKE A CAB.

31:19.110 --> 31:22.534
STOP IT! JUST RELAX
AND STAY, PLEASE.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.301
I WANT YOU TO STAY.

31:24.410 --> 31:27.106
PLEASE.

31:35.420 --> 31:38.025
ALL RIGHT.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.849
- BUT JUST FOR
A LITTLE WHILE, OKAY?
- FINE.

31:40.960 --> 31:43.394
FUCKING-- FUCK!

31:43.500 --> 31:45.491
SHIT! GOD!

31:45.600 --> 31:47.693
FUCK! SHIT!

31:47.800 --> 31:49.688
IT'S JUST A BIRD.
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

31:49.800 --> 31:51.563
I'M JUST KINDA
FREAKED OUT BY THINGS

31:51.670 --> 31:54.468
THAT ARE MOVING AROUND
THAT I CAN'T CONTROL.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.174
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.168
DID YOU STOP TAKING
YOUR MEDICATION?

31:59.280 --> 32:02.738
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
A GOOD THING.

32:02.850 --> 32:06.946
- WHY?
- BECAUSE, CLAIRE,
OKAY,

32:07.050 --> 32:09.109
I'M SICK OF FEELING
LIKE I'M LIVING EVERY MOMENT

32:09.220 --> 32:13.725
INSIDE A GIANT XEROXED
FUCKING COTTON BALL.

32:13.830 --> 32:16.458
- I GOTTA GO OUTSIDE.
- NO, DON'T GO.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.597
I'M JUST GOING OUTSIDE.
WILL YOU FUCKING LISTEN
WHEN I TALK?

32:19.700 --> 32:21.964
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I'M JUST GOING OUTSIDE.

32:22.070 --> 32:25.665
- Billy: JESUS CHRIST.
- WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?

32:25.770 --> 32:27.306
NOTHING.
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

32:27.410 --> 32:29.878
- HE DIDN'T JUST
HIT YOU, DID HE?
- NO.

32:29.980 --> 32:32.301
WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP
BEING SUCH A FREAK?

32:32.410 --> 32:34.378
BY THE WAY, THE BIRD
IS IN THE BEDROOM NOW.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.710
YEAH, WELL, HOW DID
THE BIRD GET IN
THE BEDROOM?

32:36.820 --> 32:39.414
IT FLEW IN THE DOOR.
STOP FUCKING UP.

32:39.520 --> 32:43.149
SHE USED TO BE THE WIFE
ON THAT BIG FAT HUSBAND SHOW.

32:43.260 --> 32:46.388
- WHICH ONE?
- "MORE FOR ME."

32:46.490 --> 32:48.424
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS
THE SAME VICTORIA ADAMS?

32:48.530 --> 32:51.920
OH, YEAH YEAH,
THAT SHOW WAS A HUGE HIT
FOR SEVEN YEARS,

32:52.030 --> 32:54.260
AND THEN WHEN THEY FINALLY
SHUT DOWN,

32:54.370 --> 32:57.396
- SHE OPENED
THAT KNITTING STORE.
- SHE NEVER MENTIONS IT.

32:57.500 --> 33:00.708
WELL, THEN I BET
SHE STILL DOES THAT
WINKING THING, RIGHT?

33:00.810 --> 33:02.505
SHE DOES DO THAT
WINKING THING.

33:02.610 --> 33:06.876
WELL, THAT WAS HER THING
ON THE SHOW, YEAH.

33:06.980 --> 33:08.948
- HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?
- Brenda: OH, YEAH.

33:09.050 --> 33:11.746
"MAX THE POET,
AND HE'S THE DOG."

33:11.850 --> 33:15.513
- WHAT ARE YOU READING?
- WE ARE READING A BOOK ABOUT
A DOG WHO IS ALSO A POET.

33:15.620 --> 33:17.986
- EXCUSE ME.
- Keith: YOU ARE? GREAT.

33:18.090 --> 33:21.355
David:
YEAH, DOGGIE
DOGGIE DOGGIE.

33:21.460 --> 33:25.191
- HE'S A DOG.
- Maya: YEP YEP.

33:25.300 --> 33:28.189
BY THE WAY,
JUST FOR THE RECORD,

33:28.300 --> 33:30.837
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SISSY PASQUESE MEANS
WHEN SHE SAYS "PRIVATE,"

33:30.940 --> 33:34.068
BUT THOSE KIDS
OF HERS KNOW WAY TOO
MUCH ABOUT EVERYTHING.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.205
I THINK IT'S NICE THEY'VE
BEEN GIVEN SOME PERSPECTIVE.

33:36.310 --> 33:38.301
YEAH, IN EXCHANGE
FOR A CHILDHOOD.

33:38.410 --> 33:40.799
WHATEVER WE DO,
WE'RE NOT GONNA PUT
OUR KIDS THROUGH THAT.

33:40.910 --> 33:45.188
PARENTS CAN HAVE
A FEW SECRETS.
IT'S NOT A BAD THING.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.884
- I'M SERIOUS.
- FINE. WE'LL HAVE SECRETS.

33:47.990 --> 33:50.288
YOU GOT IT.

33:50.390 --> 33:52.620
OKAY.

33:52.730 --> 33:57.451
"PARIS, THE CITY OF DREAMS,
THE CITY OF LIGHTS,

33:57.560 --> 33:59.596
THE CITY OF LOVE."

33:59.700 --> 34:02.430
( moaning )

34:07.070 --> 34:09.436
SHH SHH SHH.
YOU'RE GONNA WAKE THE BOYS.

34:09.540 --> 34:12.247
NO, THEY SLEEP
THROUGH IT NOW.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.310
OKAY.

34:22.790 --> 34:25.122
( rock music playing )

34:29.630 --> 34:31.564
IS THIS THE LINE T0 PEE?

34:31.670 --> 34:34.059
YEP.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.232
SO THE BIRD'S
IN THERE NOW?

34:40.340 --> 34:42.137
- YEAH.
- HOW'D IT GET IN THERE?

34:42.240 --> 34:45.801
- I DON'T KNOW.
- WHAT DID YOU SAY TO BILLY?
HE WAS REALLY UPSET.

34:45.910 --> 34:48.708
I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING TO BILLY. HE HAD
SOME THING WITH CLAIRE,

34:48.820 --> 34:51.983
- HE GOT MAD
AND HE WALKED OUT.
- WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

34:52.090 --> 34:53.842
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED, BRENDA.

34:53.950 --> 34:56.748
I GUESS WHAT USUALLY
HAPPENS. YOUR BROTHER
WENT FUCKING MENTAL.

34:56.860 --> 34:59.988
HEY, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO WAIT A FEW SECONDS
BEFORE YOU GO IN THERE.

35:00.090 --> 35:02.399
( laughs )

35:02.500 --> 35:03.592
THAN KS.

35:03.700 --> 35:06.191
WHY DID YOU FUCKING
INVITE THAT GUY?

35:06.300 --> 35:08.188
- I THOUGHT HE
WAS YOUR FRIEND.
- HE'S NOT.

35:08.300 --> 35:10.689
- YOU KNOW,
IT REALLY--
- EXCUSE ME.

35:13.670 --> 35:15.809
I HATE THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS
JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS
ABOUT BILLY.

35:15.910 --> 35:19.209
- YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE
THAT HE'S GETTING BETTER.
- NO, I WON'T.

35:19.310 --> 35:21.619
I HATE THAT HE'S
WITH CLAIRE AND IN
OUR FUCKING HOUSE.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.711
YEAH, WELL, AT LEAST
HE KNOWS HOW TO KEEP
A SECRET.

35:23.820 --> 35:26.516
LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU
TOLD JACKIE, SO WHAT'S
THE BIG FUCKING DEAL?

35:26.620 --> 35:29.714
THERE IS A VERY BIG
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME
TELLING MY SUPERVISOR,

35:29.820 --> 35:32.027
AND YOU TELLING OUR
ENTIRE FAMILY, WHO ARE
NOW LOOKING AT ME

35:32.130 --> 35:35.099
- WONDERING WHEN I'M GONNA
LOSE THIS BABY.
- JESUS CHRIST!

35:35.200 --> 35:38.966
- THIS MORNING I WASN'T EXCITED
ENOUGH, NOW I'M TOO EXCITED.
- NO, THAT WASN'T EXCITEMENT.

35:39.070 --> 35:43.063
- THAT WAS MACHO,
AGGRESSIVE MALE BULLSHIT.
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

35:43.170 --> 35:46.662
- IT MAKES ME WONDER
IF WE SHOULD BE TOGETHER.
- WE JUST GOT MARRIED.

35:46.770 --> 35:50.638
YEAH, WELL, IF IT'S NOT
RIGHT, IT'S NOT RIGHT.

35:50.740 --> 35:55.109
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LIGHT
A MATCH IN THERE.
IT WASN'T ME.

35:55.220 --> 35:58.712
YOU'RE FREAKED OUT RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE YOU'RE PREGNANT.
YOU SEE THAT, DON'T YOU?

35:58.820 --> 36:00.549
YEAH, WITH A BABY
THAT YOU DON'T EVEN WANT.

36:00.650 --> 36:02.789
- BULLSHIT!
- YOU DON'T
RESPECT ME ENOUGH

36:02.890 --> 36:04.721
TO WAIT UNTIL WE KNOW THAT
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT

36:04.830 --> 36:07.025
- BEFORE YOU TELL
THE WHOLE WORLD.
- SHUT THE FUCK UP!

36:07.130 --> 36:09.758
I NEED TO PEE.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.595
Jackie and Tom:
NATE!

36:17.700 --> 36:19.634
YEAH?

36:20.640 --> 36:23.803
TEQUILA SHOTS
IN THE KITCHEN.

36:23.910 --> 36:25.639
( man yelling )

36:25.750 --> 36:27.809
GET IN HERE!

36:33.050 --> 36:34.813
SO YOU STOPPED TAKING IT?

36:34.920 --> 36:37.684
- JUST LIKE THAT?
- YEAH.

36:40.360 --> 36:43.397
AND YOU FEEL...?

36:43.500 --> 36:46.298
I FEEL A LITTLE TINGLY.

36:46.400 --> 36:49.528
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.699
WHAT DO THEY GOT
YOU ON THESE DAYS?

36:51.810 --> 36:54.370
WELL, THEY JUST SWITCHED ME
FROM LITHIUM TO TOFRANIL,

36:54.480 --> 36:57.699
IN BETWEEN
THE SHOCK TREATMENTS.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.818
WHAT ARE THOSE LIKE?

37:01.920 --> 37:07.313
HON ESTLY. ..
I DON'T KNOW.

37:07.420 --> 37:10.583
I GO IN.
THEY PUT ME ON A BED.
THEY GIVE ME SOME OXYGEN.

37:10.690 --> 37:14.251
THEY SAY, "YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
A LITTLE PRICK IN YOUR HAND."
THAT ALWAYS MAKES ME LAUGH.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.555
AND THEN THE NEXT THING
I KNOW I WAKE UP

37:16.660 --> 37:18.821
WITH THE WORST HEADACHE
I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.858
DO YOU THINK IT'S HELPING?

37:25.970 --> 37:29.269
I THINK THAT...

37:29.380 --> 37:31.974
AS MILE COU USED TO SAY,

37:32.080 --> 37:36.744
"EVERY DAY IN EVERY WAY,
I AM GETTING BETTER
AND BETTER."

37:38.890 --> 37:41.381
BUT NOT EVERYONE AGREES.

37:41.490 --> 37:43.549
YEAH, IT'S HARD TO GET
YOUR SHIT TOGETHER

37:43.660 --> 37:45.753
WITH SOMEONE WATCHING
ALL THE TIME.

37:45.860 --> 37:48.351
YEAH, IT IS.

37:48.460 --> 37:51.463
BUT WHEN NO ONE'S WATCHING,
THEN WHERE ARE YOU?

37:51.570 --> 37:53.925
WHERE THE FUCK
ARE YOU THEN?

38:00.940 --> 38:04.808
* DADDY SANG BASS

38:04.910 --> 38:07.470
* MAMA SANG TENOR

38:07.580 --> 38:10.743
* ME AND LITTLE BROTHER
WOULD JOIN RIGHT IN THERE *

38:10.850 --> 38:16.755
* SINGIN' SEEMED TO HELP
A TROUBLED SOUL... *

38:23.860 --> 38:25.669
I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.

38:25.770 --> 38:28.637
- OKAY.
- WHY DON'T YOU GIVE
THESE TO CLAIRE?

38:28.740 --> 38:31.129
- YEAH, SURE.
- THANKS.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.538
HAPPY BIRTH DAY.

38:33.640 --> 38:36.234
I MEAN, IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU.

38:36.340 --> 38:38.672
YEAH.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.185
Brenda:
"LOUIE'S WEARING
THE GREEN HAT."

38:51.290 --> 38:53.178
- WHO'S THAT?
- Maya: LOUIS.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.053
LOUIS. THAT'S RIGHT.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.799
HEY.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.562
HEY.

39:00.670 --> 39:03.138
YOU MUST BE LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS ROUTINE.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.959
YEAH, I THINK IT'S
GONNA BE WONDERFUL.

39:06.070 --> 39:07.662
OH, COME ON.

39:07.770 --> 39:10.568
WHO'S GOT ON
THE BLUE COAT?

39:12.450 --> 39:14.509
- WHO'S THAT?
- BEAR.

39:14.620 --> 39:17.976
- THE BEAR, THE BEAR.
- THE BEAR.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.920
FOR SO MANY YEARS,
DAVID WAS ALWAYS
THE ONE SAYING,

39:25.030 --> 39:26.759
"COME ON,
LET'S HAVE KIDS."

39:26.860 --> 39:29.158
AND I WAS THE ONE
ON THE FENCE,

39:29.260 --> 39:31.228
BUT NOW THAT IT'S
ACTUALLY GONNA HAPPEN,

39:31.330 --> 39:36.063
I'M FINALLY REALIZING THAT
I'M GONNA BE DISAPPOINTED
IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.

39:36.170 --> 39:37.831
OH, IT'LL WORK OUT.

39:37.940 --> 39:41.501
IT'S LIKE I'M ALREADY MISSING
THIS KID THAT WE DON'T
EVEN HAVE YET.

39:41.610 --> 39:44.135
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG,
DAVID'S EXCITED TOO.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.970
OH, YEAH, YOU KNOW,
NATE TOO.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.776
IT'S A TEAM EFFORT.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.115
I'LL LET YOU GUYS
HAVE YOUR MOMENT.

39:54.220 --> 39:55.653
SAY "GOOD NIGHT,
UNCLE KEITH."

39:55.760 --> 39:59.025
- GOOD NIGHT, UNCLE KEITH.
- GOOD NIGHT.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.825
ARE YOU SLEEPY,
LITTLE ONE?

40:00.930 --> 40:03.251
- COULD YOU TURN
THE LIGHT OFF?
- OH, YEAH, SURE.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.169
AND CLOSE THE DOOR, THANKS.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.192
OKAY, LITTLE ONE,

40:07.300 --> 40:09.939
I THINK
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TONIGHT.

40:10.040 --> 40:13.032
MM, RASPBERRY.

40:15.310 --> 40:17.676
EVERYTHING TASTES
LIKE BEER RIGHT NOW.

40:21.380 --> 40:22.847
- HEY.
- HEY.

40:22.950 --> 40:25.009
HEY.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.519
GEORGE TOLD ME

40:26.620 --> 40:29.350
THAT BILLY TOLD HIM
TO TELL YOU TO GIVE YOU THESE.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.189
BILLY LEFT?

40:31.290 --> 40:33.952
THAT'S WHAT GEORGE SAID.

40:35.730 --> 40:37.550
I'M SORRY.
YOU WANT SOME CAKE?

40:37.660 --> 40:39.469
- NO.
- COME ON, HAVE SOME.

40:39.570 --> 40:43.666
- HEY, DUDE, LEAVE HER ALONE.
- I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF,
THANKS.

40:45.340 --> 40:47.137
LOOKS LIKE
IT'S CAKE TIME.

40:47.240 --> 40:49.037
I'VE BEEN SAVING UP
FOR THIS.

40:49.140 --> 40:52.701
OOH, GOOD.

40:52.810 --> 40:55.779
FUCK. ALL RIGHT, FINE,
I'LL HAVE A PIECE.

40:56.620 --> 40:59.544
HERE YOU GO.

41:14.270 --> 41:17.239
- ( sighs )
- I'M IN HERE.

41:17.340 --> 41:19.399
- HEY.
- SORRY.

41:19.510 --> 41:22.399
NO, THAT'S OKAY.
IT'S COOL.

41:22.510 --> 41:25.104
I JUST NEEDED A MOMENT.

41:25.210 --> 41:28.247
YEAH, ME, TOO.

41:28.350 --> 41:30.318
IS IT GONE?

41:30.420 --> 41:33.480
- YEAH.
- FINALLY.

41:33.590 --> 41:36.582
YOU KNOW, MOM AND GEORGE,
THEY LEFT.

41:36.690 --> 41:38.783
I'M GETTING A RIDE
FROM KEITH AND DAVID.

41:38.890 --> 41:40.755
OH.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.392
TEQUILA?

41:45.500 --> 41:47.923
SURE.

41:52.270 --> 41:54.204
THAN KS.

42:01.150 --> 42:03.277
( speaking Spanish )

42:08.150 --> 42:09.879
IM PRESSIVE.

42:09.990 --> 42:13.027
YEAH, MANY YEARS
IN ARIZONA, MUCH TEQUILA.

42:13.130 --> 42:14.950
OH.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.992
GOOD BIRTH DAY?

42:20.100 --> 42:22.591
YEAH, IT'S OKAY.

42:25.910 --> 42:27.605
FEEL LIKE ALL I CAN
GET OUT OF THIS BIRTHDAY

42:27.710 --> 42:30.679
IS THAT LIFE
IS REALLY FUCKING LONELY.

42:32.280 --> 42:35.477
YOU HAVE THIS
WONDERFUL FAMILY

42:35.580 --> 42:38.708
- AND A BABY ON THE WAY.
- I KNOW.

42:41.020 --> 42:43.284
AND IT'S REALLY
FUCKING LONELY.

42:47.630 --> 42:50.952
I JUST FEEL LIKE
ALL I DO ALL DAY LONG

42:51.060 --> 42:53.460
IS MANAGE MYSELF,

42:53.570 --> 42:57.995
TRY TO FUCKING CONNECT
WITH PEOPLE.

42:58.100 --> 43:00.034
BUT IT'S LIKE NO MATTER
HOW MUCH ENERGY

43:00.140 --> 43:03.974
YOU POUR INTO GETTING
TO THE STATION ON TIME

43:04.080 --> 43:06.048
OR GETTING
ON THE RIGHT TIN,

43:06.150 --> 43:09.313
THERE'S STILL NO FUCKING
GUARANTEE THAT ANYBODY'S
GONNA BE THERE FOR YOU

43:09.420 --> 43:13.015
TO PICK YOU UP
WHEN YOU GET THERE.

43:15.490 --> 43:17.913
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

43:20.090 --> 43:23.594
WELL, I KNOW THAT
IF YOU THINK LIFE'S
A VENDING MACHINE,

43:23.700 --> 43:26.589
WHERE YOU PUT IN VIRTUE

43:26.700 --> 43:28.839
AND YOU GET OUT HAPPINESS,

43:28.940 --> 43:31.659
THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY
GONNA BE DISAPPOINTED.

43:34.010 --> 43:36.035
I KNOW THAT.

43:41.480 --> 43:44.074
IS THAT HOW I SOUND?

43:44.180 --> 43:46.114
A LITTLE.

43:52.890 --> 43:55.859
Brenda:
NATE! NATE!
GET IN HERE!

43:55.960 --> 43:59.088
- FUCK!
- Tom: I DON'T THINK
BELIEVE IT.

43:59.200 --> 44:01.589
Jackie:
OH MY GOD!

44:01.700 --> 44:04.362
WELL, HOW THE FUCK
DID IT GET IN AGAIN?

44:04.470 --> 44:07.064
- THROUGH THE WINDOW.
- YEAH, WHY WAS THE WINDOW OPEN?

44:07.170 --> 44:11.231
'CAUSE YOU SAID
IT WAS IN THE BEDROOM.
DON'T BE SUCH A JERK.

44:11.340 --> 44:13.501
FUCK OFF.

44:13.610 --> 44:16.010
I HAVE TO DO EVERY
LITTLE FUCKING THING MYSELF.

44:18.580 --> 44:20.445
I HAVE TRIED
ALL NIGHT LONG

44:20.550 --> 44:22.381
TO DO THE RIGHT THING
BY THIS BIRD,

44:22.490 --> 44:25.152
BUT IT JUST KEEPS
FUCKING WITH ME.

44:25.260 --> 44:27.979
- TRY NOT TO
TAKE IT PERSONALLY.
- SHUT UP, DAVID.

44:28.090 --> 44:31.423
- ( bird squawking )
- Brenda: NATE!

44:31.530 --> 44:32.827
GET OUT!

44:32.930 --> 44:36.161
Tom:
JESUS CHRIST, CHILL.

44:38.040 --> 44:42.136
- ( glass shatters )
- GET THE MOTHERFUCK OUT!

44:42.240 --> 44:46.142
HOW MANY TIMES DO I
HAVE TO FUCKING APOLOGIZE?

44:47.080 --> 44:48.911
SORRY.

44:49.020 --> 44:52.911
I'M SO SORRY
THAT I'M PUTTING YOU
THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

44:53.020 --> 44:55.113
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
I KNOW THAT.
- NO, YOU DON'T.

44:55.220 --> 44:58.257
YOU SAY THAT YOU DO,
BUT I CAN TELL BY THE WAY
YOU LOOK AT ME,

44:58.360 --> 45:02.251
YOU THINK THAT ALL
OF THIS IS MY FAULT.

45:02.360 --> 45:05.329
YOU DON'T WANNA
MAKE LOVE TO ME.
YOU DON'T WANNA KISS ME.

45:05.430 --> 45:08.467
- YOU DON'T WANNA BE
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH ME!
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

45:08.570 --> 45:11.459
OH, YES, IT IS!

45:11.570 --> 45:13.208
RUTH...

45:13.310 --> 45:16.199
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

45:16.310 --> 45:19.871
NOBODY GROWS UP THINKING
THIS IS THE WAY THEY'RE
GONNA TURN OUT TO BE.

45:19.980 --> 45:23.848
IF I COULD CHANGE
JUST BY SNAPPING MY FINGERS,

45:23.950 --> 45:26.612
- I'D DO IT.
- I KNOW YOU WOULD, GEORGE.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.608
I AM TRYING...

45:28.720 --> 45:32.178
SO HARD TO GET BETTER.

45:32.290 --> 45:35.259
- AND YOU ARE.
- BUT NOT FAST ENOUGH
FOR YOU!

45:35.360 --> 45:39.262
YOU'RE GETTING BETTER
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.
I KNOW THAT.

45:39.370 --> 45:41.838
I AM SO LUCKY.

45:41.940 --> 45:45.159
I HATE THAT I'M
THE LUCKY ONE.

45:48.980 --> 45:51.403
NO ONE'S EVER LUCKY
TO HAVE ME.

45:53.980 --> 45:57.143
NOBODY'S EVER BEEN
LUCKY TO HAVE ME.

46:01.450 --> 46:03.884
( rock music playing )

46:29.720 --> 46:32.188
IT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

46:54.110 --> 46:56.908
- RICO, WAKE UP.
- ( mumbles )

46:57.010 --> 47:00.343
BABY, HURRY UP.
YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

47:00.450 --> 47:02.270
WHY?

47:02.380 --> 47:06.146
I DON'T WANT
THE BOYS TO SEE YOU.
IT'LL CONFUSE THEM.

47:08.150 --> 47:10.289
OH.

47:12.630 --> 47:14.586
ALL RIGHT.

47:16.930 --> 47:17.828
- I know there's
beautiful snow there--
- David: NO, THAT'S GREAT.

47:17.930 --> 47:19.727
I JUST, YOU KNOW...

47:19.830 --> 47:21.559
THANK YOU.

47:21.670 --> 47:24.389
OKAY, BYE.

47:24.500 --> 47:25.865
WHO WAS THAT?

47:25.970 --> 47:29.371
- ROGER.
- WHAT DID HE WANT?

47:29.480 --> 47:31.732
IT TURNS OUT SISSY
WAS THE BOARD CHAIR

47:31.840 --> 47:34.741
- OF AN ADOPTION AGENCY ONCE.
- YEAH...

47:34.850 --> 47:38.274
SHE CALLED IN A FAVOR,
AND SHE SAID WE COULD
ADOPT THROUGH THEM,

47:38.380 --> 47:41.747
- IF WE STILL WANTED TO.
- WE KIND OF MADE
A COMMITMENT TO MARY.

47:41.850 --> 47:45.581
I KNOW, BUT WE DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE THAT THAT'S REALLY
GOING TO WORK OUT.

47:45.690 --> 47:47.328
WE ALWAYS SAID
WE'D PURSUE BOTH OPTIONS

47:47.430 --> 47:49.853
UNTIL IT MADE SENSE
TO STOP, RIGHT?

47:49.960 --> 47:52.326
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.639
SO NOW ROGER'S
YOUR HERO?

48:07.080 --> 48:09.913
SO YOU GOT LIKE ALMOST NO
HAIRCUT YESTERDAY, RIGHT?

48:10.020 --> 48:14.013
HE JUST TOOK A LITTLE
OFF THE TOP.

48:25.530 --> 48:28.590
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

48:32.270 --> 48:36.104
NOWHERE.
I STAYED AT MY HOUSE.

48:37.580 --> 48:40.401
YOU FUCKED SOMEBODY.

48:40.510 --> 48:43.570
IT'S OKAY.

48:43.680 --> 48:45.545
I'M NOT MAD.

48:45.650 --> 48:48.744
JUST TELL ME WHO IT WAS.

48:48.850 --> 48:51.182
WAS IT THAT DIVORCED GUY?

48:51.290 --> 48:54.919
- BILLY, COME ON.
- I FORGIVE YOU, CLAIRE.

48:55.030 --> 48:57.954
YOU CAN JUST ADMIT IT.

48:59.630 --> 49:03.691
JUST-- JUST BE
HONEST WITH ME.

49:06.140 --> 49:09.371
YEAH, IT WAS HIM.

49:12.250 --> 49:14.206
OKAY.
