TO RAIN ON MY PARADE.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.100
WHICH, I BELIEVE,
IS ON TUESDAY.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.133
I'M JUST SAYING
WHAT YOU SAID.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.000
DON'T BUY INTO
YOUR OWN HYPE.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.400
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.500
I'M JUST LETTING
PEOPLE THINK WHAT
THEY WANT TO THINK.

09:32.500 --> 09:36.500
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M GOING TO LIE
TO MY PARENTS.

09:36.500 --> 09:39.100
SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!

09:39.100 --> 09:41.100
FOR ME?

09:41.100 --> 09:44.600
YES! THERE'S THE MAN
THAT SAVED THE SCHOOL!

09:44.600 --> 09:45.700
ERIC TOLD YOU?

09:45.700 --> 09:46.800
I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.300
THE PHONE HASN'T STOPPED
RINGING ALL DAY.

09:49.300 --> 09:52.200
WELL, THEN WHY
DIDN'T YOU JUST
ANSWER IT?

09:52.200 --> 09:54.800
SO, COR,
TELL US EVERYTHING.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.000
WELL, MOM, DAD,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE
EXACTLY HEARD,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.133
BUT...HERE'S WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED.

10:01.133 --> 10:04.233
O.K.

10:04.233 --> 10:08.133
I WAS WALKING BACK
FROM CHUBBIES WHEN
I SAW THE FLAMES.

10:08.133 --> 10:09.667
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO THINK.

10:09.667 --> 10:10.867
THE NEXT THING I KNOW,

10:10.867 --> 10:12.033
I'M RUNNING
INTO THE BUILDING...

10:13.834 --> 10:15.200
HYAH!

10:16.400 --> 10:19.667
SHAWN, YOU DIDN'T STAY
FOR DINNER LAST NIGHT.

10:19.667 --> 10:21.500
HEY, I WASN'T HUNGRY.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.867
I KNOW YOU WERE
MAD AT ME.

10:23.867 --> 10:26.567
I DIDN'T WANT TO LIE
TO MY PARENTS, BUT...

10:26.567 --> 10:30.200
I FIGURED
IF I TOLD THE TRUTH,
THINGS WOULD BE WORSE.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.500
YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT
JUST GETTING OFF
ON THIS WHOLE THING?

10:32.500 --> 10:35.667
I'M GIVING PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.467
I DON'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT THEM.

10:37.467 --> 10:38.467
DISAPPOINT THEM?

10:38.467 --> 10:41.000
LISTEN TO MY MORNING.
LISTEN TO THIS.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.233
PHOTO SHOOT
WITH THE HOMECOMING QUEEN,

10:43.233 --> 10:44.300
SUSHI WITH DR. SORRELL,

10:44.300 --> 10:47.200
I HAVE TO GREET
THE NEW EXCHANGE STUDENTS.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.000
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE IT STOP.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.200
YOU CAN JUST
TELL THEM NO.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.000
I'M AFRAID TO DO THAT.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.100
WHY?

10:55.100 --> 10:57.767
I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE OLD CORY MATTHEWS.

10:57.767 --> 10:59.000
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HIM?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.667
SHAWN, I'VE BEEN
AT THIS SCHOOL
FOR TWO YEARS.

11:01.667 --> 11:04.967
AND PEOPLE STILL CALL ME
ERIC'S BROTHER,
SHAWN'S FRIEND,

11:04.967 --> 11:07.734
OR MY FAVORITE,
"HEY, KID! MOVE!"

11:07.734 --> 11:11.500
AREN'T YOU AFRAID
THIS THING IS GETTING
OUT OF CONTROL?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.800
I LIED TO MY SCHOOL,
MY FOLKS.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.667
HOW MUCH WORSE
CAN IT GET, RIGHT?

11:15.667 --> 11:16.800
MATTHEWS.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.033
HERE'S YOUR CHANCE
TO TELL ALL PHILADELPHIA

11:19.033 --> 11:20.233
ABOUT YOUR HEROISM.

11:20.233 --> 11:21.734
THERE'S YOUR ANSWER.

11:21.734 --> 11:23.100
ELI CALLED SOME BUDDIES...

11:23.100 --> 11:25.867
YOU'LL BE APPEARING
ON <i>PHILADELPHIA TONIGHT. </i>

11:25.867 --> 11:27.834
THEY WANT ME ON TV?

11:27.834 --> 11:29.300
YOU AND
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY!

11:29.300 --> 11:31.600
THEY'LL BE AT
YOUR HOUSE TONIGHT.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.367
HUH? ISN'T THAT GREAT?

11:33.367 --> 11:35.200
EXCUSE ME.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.700
FAMOUS PEOPLE.

11:42.700 --> 11:45.100
THEY'RE ALL WEIRD.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.000
AH, COME ON,
HE'S JUST NERVOUS.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.934
HE'LL WALK
INTO BURNING BUILDINGS,

11:48.934 --> 11:51.200
BUT HE'S SCARED
OF A LITTLE TV CAMERA.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.767
IT'S ALMOST CUTE.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.934
THAT'S IT, SHAWN.

11:56.934 --> 11:58.233
I'VE REACHED MY LIMIT.

11:58.233 --> 12:00.066
I CAN'T GO
THROUGH WITH THIS.

12:00.066 --> 12:02.767
CAN'T GO THROUGH
WITH WHAT, MATTHEWS?

12:02.767 --> 12:05.200
CORY'S GOING ON TV.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.667
WHAT ON EARTH FOR?

12:06.667 --> 12:08.834
THEY WANT THE WHOLE
FIRE STORY.

12:08.834 --> 12:10.133
OH, WONDERFUL.

12:10.133 --> 12:11.600
I'VE ALSO BEEN WAITING

12:11.600 --> 12:15.000
FOR THE <i>WHOLE </i>STORY.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
W-W-WELL, MR. FEENY,

12:16.000 --> 12:18.100
YOU KNOW PRETTY MUCH
EVERYTHING.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.100
PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.367
WHAT DID
HE MEAN BY THAT?

12:24.367 --> 12:25.367
OH, IT'S FEENY.

12:25.367 --> 12:26.667
THREE YEARS
AND I STILL DON'T

12:26.667 --> 12:28.200
UNDERSTAND
A WORD HE SAYS.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.300
<i>HELLO, YOU'RE ON THE AIR </i>
<i>WITH DR. SHARON. </i>

12:34.300 --> 12:35.300
HI, DOCTOR SHARON.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.367
FIRST TIME CALLER.

12:36.367 --> 12:38.467
<i>AND YOUR NAME IS? </i>

12:39.567 --> 12:41.100
GOMEZ.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.467
<i>AND WHY ARE YOU </i>
<i>CALLING TODAY? </i>

12:43.467 --> 12:45.867
I NEEDED
SOMEBODY TO TALK TO.

12:45.867 --> 12:48.400
<i>TALK TO ME, GOMEZ. </i>

12:48.400 --> 12:49.700
<i>GOMEZ? </i>

12:49.700 --> 12:50.700
OH.

12:50.700 --> 12:52.200
RIGHT, THAT'S ME.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.300
WELL, DR. SHARON,

12:53.300 --> 12:56.100
I'M IN KIND OF
A BAD SITUATION.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.133
SEE, UH...

12:57.133 --> 12:59.200
PEOPLE THINK
I'M SOMETHING I'M NOT,

12:59.200 --> 13:00.800
AND I WANT TO COME CLEAN.

13:00.800 --> 13:05.000
BUT I'M AFRAID THE TRUTH
WILL MAKE THINGS WORSE.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.600
<i>SO WHAT I'M HEARING IS, </i>

13:06.600 --> 13:08.967
<i>YOU'RE IN NEED OF </i>
<i>A LITTLE COURAGE? </i>

13:08.967 --> 13:10.033
YES.

13:10.033 --> 13:11.200
YES, I AM.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.000
BUT WHERE
DO I FIND THAT?

13:13.000 --> 13:17.467
<i>I SUGGEST YOU LOOK </i>
<i>DEEP INSIDE YOURSELF. </i>

13:17.467 --> 13:19.934
I'VE BEEN ON HOLD
FOR 45 MINUTES...

13:19.934 --> 13:21.900
THAT'S THE BEST
YOU CAN DO?

13:21.900 --> 13:23.367
<i>I HAVE ANOTHER </i>
<i>SUGGESTION-- </i>

13:23.367 --> 13:24.367
<i>TONIGHT AT 7:30, </i>

<i>THEY'RE DOING </i>
<i>AN INSPIRATIONAL STORY </i>

<i>ABOUT A BRAVE BOY </i>
<i>NAMED CORY MATTHEWS. </i>

AW, WHAT THE HECK
DO YOU KNOW, LADY!

13:37.867 --> 13:39.834
THERE'S NO
TURNING BACK NOW.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.867
THE NEWS VAN
HAS PULLED UP.

13:41.867 --> 13:43.900
THEY'RE BRINGING
IN CAMERAS...

13:43.900 --> 13:44.900
CABLES...

13:44.900 --> 13:45.967
LIGHTS...

13:45.967 --> 13:46.967
OOH!

13:46.967 --> 13:47.967
WHAT?

13:47.967 --> 13:49.700
BAGELS.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.500
YOU KNOW WHAT, SHAWN.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.500
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE WITH ME.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.567
WHERE ELSE WOULD I BE?

13:57.567 --> 13:58.567
GOMEZ.

13:58.567 --> 13:59.867
I MEAN--

13:59.867 --> 14:00.867
I'M PARTLY TO BLAME.

14:00.867 --> 14:03.500
I TOLD YOU
TO RIDE THIS OUT.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.400
SO YOU'LL GO
ON TV WITH ME?

14:05.400 --> 14:07.367
AND LIE
TO THE ENTIRE CITY?

14:07.367 --> 14:09.367
WHAT KIND OF IDIOT
WOULD DO THAT?

14:09.367 --> 14:12.834
AHEM, HALF-HOUR
TO OUR DEBUT, BOYS.

14:12.834 --> 14:14.300
<i>OUR </i>DEBUT?

WHAT I MEAN.

14:17.700 --> 14:18.700
RICH

14:18.700 --> 14:19.800
HERRARA.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.800
WHAT?

14:20.800 --> 14:21.800
RICH HERRARA?

14:21.800 --> 14:23.934
THE WEATHER GUY
ON <i>PHILLY TONIGHT? </i>

14:23.934 --> 14:24.934
WHAT A LAME-O.

14:24.934 --> 14:26.900
ONCE THE AUDIENCE
SEES ME,

14:26.900 --> 14:27.900
HERRARA'S OUT...

14:27.900 --> 14:29.033
MATTHEWS IS IN.

14:29.033 --> 14:32.000
BETCHA THAT'S NOT
IN HIS 5-DAY FORECAST, HUH?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.500
EVERYBODY LOVES
RICH HERRARA.

14:33.500 --> 14:38.200
HE'S NOTHING
BUT A HEAD OF HAIR
AND A WINNING SMILE.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.200
AHEM, SO--

14:39.200 --> 14:41.500
HOW DO I LOOK?

14:41.500 --> 14:43.500
HEAD OF HAIR,
WINNING SMILE.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.500
YES!

14:44.500 --> 14:47.400
I AM <i>SO </i>
<i>THE NEW WEATHERMAN. </i>

14:49.133 --> 14:50.300
ERIC--

14:50.300 --> 14:52.500
WHAT IF THIS TV THING
DIDN'T HAPPEN TONIGHT?

14:52.500 --> 14:54.400
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

14:54.400 --> 14:57.600
WELL, WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
I'M NOT REALLY A HERO?

14:57.600 --> 14:59.300
THAT I STARTED THE FIRE,

14:59.300 --> 15:03.200
AND THIS WHOLE THING
KIND OF SNOWBALLED.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.800
YOU'RE PROTECTING HERRARA,
AREN'T YOU?

15:11.100 --> 15:14.000
THIS IS THE LOW POINT
OF MY LIFE.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.200
AFTER THIS,
IT'S STRAIGHT TO HELL!

15:16.200 --> 15:17.500
AND THE WORST PART?

15:17.500 --> 15:18.500
WHAT?

15:18.500 --> 15:20.467
I'LL HAVE TO PUT OUT
THE FIRE!

15:20.467 --> 15:23.400
O.K., GUYS, THIS IS HOW
IT WILL WORK.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.567
IN 30 SECONDS
WE'RE ON, O.K.?

15:25.567 --> 15:27.200
I'LL POP SOME QUESTIONS--

15:27.200 --> 15:28.200
WE'LL TALK--

15:28.200 --> 15:29.200
"WE LOVE HIM."

15:29.200 --> 15:31.200
NOW DON'T HOLD
ANY TEARS BACK.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.967
WE'LL DO A COMMERCIAL--

15:32.967 --> 15:34.200
MARCH OUT THE HERO--

15:34.200 --> 15:35.200

15:36.367 --> 15:38.600
LOAD UP THE VAN, AND WE'RE
DRINKING BY 9:00.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.700
WELL, NOT THE YOUNG ONES,
OF COURSE.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.767
YOU WORKED WITH HER?

15:43.767 --> 15:45.667

15:45.667 --> 15:47.133
HELLO, CONNIE!

15:47.133 --> 15:48.300

HANDSOME YOUNG MAN?

15:50.500 --> 15:52.567

THE PLEASURE'S ALL MINE.

15:52.567 --> 15:54.367
HAVE YOU BEEN
OUTSIDE TODAY?

15:54.367 --> 15:55.834

16:05.100 --> 16:06.100
I WANT SMILES,

16:06.100 --> 16:07.100
HAVE FUN,

16:07.100 --> 16:09.934

TALK OVER ME.

16:12.867 --> 16:14.100

WE'RE IN THE HOME OF
CORY MATTHEWS,

16:16.834 --> 16:19.033
WHO COURAGEOUSLY
SAVED HIS SCHOOL.

16:19.033 --> 16:20.033
PSST.

16:20.033 --> 16:21.033
HEY. HEY, YOU.

16:21.033 --> 16:22.033

16:22.033 --> 16:23.100
WE SWITCH SHIRTS--

16:23.100 --> 16:24.233
YOU DO THE INTERVIEW,

16:24.233 --> 16:26.600
AND I'LL HOLD
YOUR SOUND STICK.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.133
WHAT A GAS!

16:29.233 --> 16:31.767
EXCUSE ME,
ARE YOU PART OF THIS?

16:31.767 --> 16:32.767
EXCUSE ME, YEAH...

16:32.767 --> 16:35.200
I HELPED CORY
START THE FIRE.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.400
LATER IN THE PROGRAM,
CORY HIMSELF.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.200
BUT FIRST, HIS FAMILY.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.000
YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
YES, WE ARE.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.400
YEAH, H-H-HE'S
A GREAT KID.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.200
AND HOW DOES IT FEEL

16:46.200 --> 16:48.367
KNOWING YOU'VE RAISED
A GREAT KID?

16:48.367 --> 16:51.467
IT--WELL, CONNIE,
YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY.

16:51.467 --> 16:52.500

16:52.500 --> 16:55.033
BRING THIS LITTLE
WRINKLED THING HOME,

16:55.033 --> 16:57.100
AND YOU NEVER EXPECT
ONE DAY--

16:57.100 --> 16:59.233
CONNIE,
IF I MAY PROTRUDE.

16:59.233 --> 17:01.900
UH, YES...
ERIC, THE BROTHER.

17:01.900 --> 17:04.000
I LIKE TO LOOK AT CORY

17:04.000 --> 17:06.233
AS A COASTAL EDDY.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.300
HE COMES HOME FROM SCHOOL

17:08.300 --> 17:09.400

17:09.400 --> 17:10.400
THANK YOU.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.600
LET'S GET
TO THE POINT, HERE.

17:12.600 --> 17:15.100
HAS BEING A HERO
CHANGED CORY?

17:15.100 --> 17:16.967
WELL, HERE'S
SOME BIRTHDAY WISHES.

17:16.967 --> 17:20.300
GORGEOUS EDNA STEIN

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, EDNA!

17:21.300 --> 17:22.300

17:22.300 --> 17:23.934
DAD, THIS IS LIVE TV.

17:23.934 --> 17:24.934
I DON'T CARE.

17:24.934 --> 17:26.800
UH, BACK TO YOU, CONNIE!

17:26.800 --> 17:28.300
HA, HA, THOSE KIDS.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.300
HE'S GOING.

17:29.300 --> 17:30.400
YOU ASKED, UM,

17:30.400 --> 17:33.667
IF CORY HAS CHANGED
NOW THAT HE'S A HERO.

17:33.667 --> 17:35.800
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T THINK SO.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.033
BUT THAT'S WHAT'S
SO GREAT...

17:37.033 --> 17:40.400
HE'S STILL THE SAME
WONDERFUL KID HE ALWAYS WAS.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.800
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

17:41.800 --> 17:44.300
CORY DIDN'T DO THIS
TO BE A HERO.

17:44.300 --> 17:48.100
HE DID THIS BECAUSE
IT HAD TO BE DONE.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.367
DOING THE RIGHT THING...

17:49.367 --> 17:52.200
THAT'S WHAT MAKES
HIM SPECIAL.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.934
AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK

17:56.934 --> 17:58.100
WITH CORY MATTHEWS HIMSELF

17:58.100 --> 18:00.900
AFTER THIS WEATHER UPDATE
FROM RICH HERRARA.

18:00.900 --> 18:04.200
[ERIC]
NOOOOOO!

18:05.300 --> 18:06.300
HEY.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.800
YOU SEE THESE AZALEAS?

18:07.800 --> 18:10.800
THEY THRIVE
ON SUNSHINE AND WATER.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.834
NOT COAXIAL CABLES.

18:12.834 --> 18:17.100
AND TAKE YOUR GENERATOR
OFF MY BRAMBLE BUSH.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.734
AH, MR. MATTHEWS.

18:21.734 --> 18:26.734
THE EYES OF PHILADELPHIA
ARE UPON YOU TONIGHT.

18:26.734 --> 18:28.500
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.734
PRE-SHOW JITTERS?

18:30.734 --> 18:33.400
NO, I'M JUST NOT
COMFORTABLE GOING ON TV

18:33.400 --> 18:34.700
AND BEING THIS...

18:34.700 --> 18:35.967
HERO.

18:35.967 --> 18:37.400
HERO.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.000
WHAT IS THAT, ANYWAY?

18:40.000 --> 18:43.600
DIFFERENT THINGS
TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE,
I SUPPOSE.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.033
A FIREFIGHTER
CAN BE A HERO.

18:46.033 --> 18:47.900
I KNOW A MAN WHO WORKED

18:47.900 --> 18:50.200
IN THE FACTORY
FOR 30 YEARS...

18:50.200 --> 18:51.367
AND HE HATED IT.

18:51.367 --> 18:54.600
HE DID IT
TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.600
I FELT HE WAS A HERO.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.500
SOUNDS LIKE ONE TO ME.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.133
BUT TO ME, A REAL HERO

19:00.133 --> 19:02.834
IS SOMEONE WHO DOES
THE RIGHT THING...

19:02.834 --> 19:08.100
WHEN THE RIGHT THING
ISN'T EASY TO DO.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.300
YOU KNOW, MR. FEENY,
DON'T YOU?

19:13.300 --> 19:14.934
YOU'VE KNOWN ALL ALONG.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.400
MR. MATTHEWS,

19:17.400 --> 19:19.667
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FACTS
TO MAKE TROUBLE FOR ANYONE,

19:19.667 --> 19:21.400
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

19:21.400 --> 19:25.300
YOU HAVE
AN INTERVIEW TO DO.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.600
CORY, HEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:27.600 --> 19:28.967
THEY'RE READY NOW.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
MOM. DAD.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.967
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS.

19:32.967 --> 19:34.100
DO WHAT?

19:34.100 --> 19:36.000
GO ON LYING TO YOU.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.200
BOY, THIS IS HARD.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.367
YOU KNOW THAT FIRE
I PUT OUT?

19:41.367 --> 19:44.367
I ALSO KIND OF
STARTED THAT FIRE.

19:44.367 --> 19:47.133
CORY, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

19:47.133 --> 19:50.400
I BROKE INTO
THE CHEM LAB ONE NIGHT

19:50.400 --> 19:52.500
TO TURN IN A LATE PAPER.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.500
I'M NO HERO...

19:53.500 --> 19:55.300
JUST BAD WITH MATCHES.

19:55.300 --> 19:57.300
YOU STARTED THAT FIRE?

19:57.300 --> 19:58.600
ACCIDENTALLY.

19:58.600 --> 20:02.367
AND YOU WENT ON
LETTING PEOPLE ASSUME
YOU WERE A HERO.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.567
WHAT WE'RE YOU THINKING?

20:03.567 --> 20:06.934
I WAS THINKING
I COULD BE SOMEBODY
I WASN'T.

20:06.934 --> 20:11.133
AND I KNOW--
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

20:11.133 --> 20:12.133
THE BIGGER MISTAKE

20:12.133 --> 20:13.400
WAS LYING TO YOU.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.834
YOU'VE MADE
LOTS OF MISTAKES HERE.

20:15.834 --> 20:18.467
I KEPT HOPING
IT WOULD GO AWAY.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.467
SO I WOULDN'T
GET IN TROUBLE.

20:20.467 --> 20:22.133
WELL, IT DIDN'T--

20:22.133 --> 20:24.033
AND YOU ARE.

20:25.567 --> 20:26.667
SO NOW WHAT?

20:26.667 --> 20:31.600
NOW WE TELL CONNIE
YOU'RE NOT GOING ON TV.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.800
AND BY "WE,"

20:32.800 --> 20:34.867
I MEAN <i>YOU. </i>

20:34.867 --> 20:36.400
SHE'LL FREAK ON ME.

20:36.400 --> 20:40.300
WELL, SHE'LL JUST
HAVE TO GET IN LINE.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.500
MR. MATTHEWS.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.834
WELL DONE.

20:44.834 --> 20:48.834
YOUR STORY
CONFIRMED WHAT I
SUSPECTED ALL ALONG.

20:48.834 --> 20:50.867
SO YOU DID KNOW.

20:50.867 --> 20:52.367
NO, NO.

20:52.367 --> 20:56.033
I JUST KNEW
THE CHARACTER
OF THE YOUNG MAN.

20:56.033 --> 20:57.800
THE CHARACTER?

20:58.867 --> 21:00.066
HEROIC.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.100
OH, BY THE WAY,

21:02.100 --> 21:04.000
I'LL SEE YOU
AT SCHOOL TOMORROW.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.500
BUT TOMORROW'S SATURDAY.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.500
YES, I KNOW.

21:06.500 --> 21:07.800
BRING OLD CLOTHES--

21:07.800 --> 21:09.934
YOU'LL BE PAINTING.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.033
TAKING HIS
LOCKER GENIE?

21:19.033 --> 21:21.200
HE STILL SAVED
YOUR LIFE.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.800
O.K.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.667
I OWE YOU MY LIFE.

21:25.667 --> 21:28.500
BUT FEENY
SIGNS THE CHECKS.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.300
CLICKER.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.133
MRS. FRAUD?

21:37.400 --> 21:38.400
WELL--

21:38.400 --> 21:39.867
SO MUCH FOR THE PERKS.

21:39.867 --> 21:42.734
WOULD YOU RATHER BE
A HERO AGAIN?

21:42.734 --> 21:43.734
NAH.

21:43.734 --> 21:46.734
I'M HAPPY BEING
PLAIN OLD CORY.

21:46.734 --> 21:48.100
I MEAN, LOOK...

21:48.100 --> 21:49.834
I GOT MY
BEST FRIEND.

21:49.834 --> 21:51.300
I GOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.400
HEY, KID!

21:52.400 --> 21:53.900
MOVE.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
AND MY OLD NAME'S BACK.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.133
HEY, DR. SORRELL.

21:58.133 --> 22:00.834
I GOT PRACTICE TOMORROW.
YOU THINK--

22:00.834 --> 22:01.767
OH, SURE, TOMMY.

22:01.767 --> 22:02.800
MISS THE LAB.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.900
TAKE YOUR TIME.

22:03.900 --> 22:05.600
OH, DR. SORRELL.

22:05.600 --> 22:06.600
HEY.

22:06.600 --> 22:07.700
UM, LISTEN,

22:07.700 --> 22:08.967
I HAVE A DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT TOMORROW.

22:08.967 --> 22:10.100
HERE'S MY MOM'S NOTE.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.967
TELL SOMEONE WHO CARES.

22:16.033 --> 22:17.900
IT'S GOOD TO BE ME.
