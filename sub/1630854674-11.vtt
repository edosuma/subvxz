00:01.610 --> 00:02.872
<i>Previously on</i> Will Trent...

00:02.872 --> 00:05.396
He did bad things with girls.

00:05.396 --> 00:07.050
What do you mean?
Lenny's nice.

00:07.050 --> 00:09.052
Lenny is a pedophile.

00:09.052 --> 00:11.272
He is a good man.
He paid his debt.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.447
Why are you protecting him

00:12.447 --> 00:13.448
instead of protecting
your daughter?

00:13.448 --> 00:14.536
You're a monster.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.190
You need to leave
my family alone.

00:16.190 --> 00:17.452
They don't deserve this.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.671
I didn't deserve
what you did to me.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.108
Didn't you?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.638
We got a lot in common.

00:29.638 --> 00:32.423
My mother had to go away,
and I was even younger than you.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.425
Did she come back?

00:34.425 --> 00:35.687
Of course she did.

00:49.788 --> 00:50.876
Nice work.

00:51.877 --> 00:55.838
20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.883
<i>Oye!</i>

00:59.624 --> 01:01.235
Get lost, old man.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.498
I'm 34.

01:03.498 --> 01:05.152
CK's crew runs this block.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.502
- Okay, chill. We're leaving.
- Leave the stash.

01:07.502 --> 01:08.633
- Go, go, go.
- Come on!

01:08.633 --> 01:09.460
Run!

01:27.261 --> 01:28.697
Why'd you let 'em go?

01:28.697 --> 01:30.090
That's my call.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.526
You run with me, okay?

01:31.526 --> 01:33.745
Not the other way around.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.486
Sorry, boss.

01:35.486 --> 01:37.140
Man, I'm sick of these zoomers.

01:38.924 --> 01:40.491
- These look like our pills.
- Yeah, knockoffs.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.363
The imprint's wrong.

01:42.363 --> 01:44.408
- You know who they work for?
- Who cares?

01:44.408 --> 01:47.107
We work for CK, me and you,

01:47.107 --> 01:49.109
Bill Black, man of mystery.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.254
When do I get
my agent back?

02:04.254 --> 02:06.648
Director Wagner, you ask
that question every week.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.780
And every week,
I don't like the answer.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.869
That's why I brought donuts
this time.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.047
Welcome to our
fifth weekly check-in

02:15.047 --> 02:16.223
on the Macon operation.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.442
- You can skip this part.
- Fine.

02:18.442 --> 02:21.053
The DEA feels that
progress has stalled.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.925
What, do you want an apology?

02:22.925 --> 02:25.145
I'm not asking you
to put your guy out on a limb.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.538
We've spilled enough blood
on this case.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.627
But Macon is drowning.

02:29.627 --> 02:32.848
They don't have the resources
to fight a drug lord like CK.

02:32.848 --> 02:34.241
But he's always been
a step ahead of us.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.286
It's been humbling.

02:37.722 --> 02:40.029
And it's why I came
to you for help.

02:40.029 --> 02:42.118
Okay, look, I was going
to Macon for a check-in anyway.

02:42.118 --> 02:45.208
I will talk to Will,
but trust takes time.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.601
I appreciate that.

02:50.082 --> 02:53.912
This agent that you lost to CK,
was he a family man?

02:53.912 --> 02:55.218
Matthew Menaker.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.046
Wife, three kids.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.221
They're reeling.

02:58.221 --> 03:01.224
There wasn't even
a body to send home.

03:01.224 --> 03:02.443
Well, Will's my best agent.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.707
He's going to come through.

03:12.322 --> 03:13.323
<i>Case notes.</i>

03:13.323 --> 03:15.543
<i>It's day 30 undercover.</i>

03:15.543 --> 03:17.414
Still building the reputation
of Bill Black

03:17.414 --> 03:19.329
to get on CK's radar.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.854
<i>Dante's my only
connection to CK.</i>

03:22.854 --> 03:24.029
Hey, Marco.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.553
Guess who's got
a nasty right hook?

03:29.209 --> 03:32.255
When he trusts me enough,
he'll intro me to his boss.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.822
Don't play me.

03:33.822 --> 03:35.693
<i>It's a simple plan
for a simple man.</i>

03:35.693 --> 03:39.044
Uh! This guy, right here.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.702
Dante, I need bread.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.748
Can you go to the store?

03:46.748 --> 03:49.968
<i>Then there's Rosa,
Dante's cousin.</i>

03:49.968 --> 03:53.276
<i>Dante says she has no idea
he works for CK.</i>

03:53.276 --> 03:54.930
Rosa, we're gonna
come up to eat.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.148
<i>Oye,</i> I can smell that
from here.

03:56.148 --> 03:58.194
- Is that guisado you're making?
- Mm-hmm.

03:59.717 --> 04:02.242
Don't you dare come back
without that bread.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.983
- Okay.
- Hi, Bill.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.289
Can I bring anything?

04:06.289 --> 04:08.378
Just your gorgeous self.

04:08.378 --> 04:11.076
<i>And she has her eye
on Bill Black.</i>

04:11.076 --> 04:12.121
<i>El pan.</i>

04:12.121 --> 04:13.992
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:15.037 --> 04:16.821
Hey, here's your cut.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.649
Tomorrow, I'm making
a cash drop to CK.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.651
You wanna tag along?

04:20.651 --> 04:23.045
- You're serious?
- Yeah. CK wants to meet you.

04:23.045 --> 04:24.351
I've been talking you up, man.

04:27.832 --> 04:30.182
Um, are we, uh, still going
to your cousin's for dinner?

04:30.182 --> 04:32.402
Yeah, yeah. Relax.
I'll see you there.

04:32.402 --> 04:35.013
Hey, head's up.
Your PO's here.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.979
Billy Black, you ready
for your surprise

04:43.979 --> 04:45.372
probation check-in?

04:45.372 --> 04:46.895
Do I have a choice?

04:46.895 --> 04:48.070
No.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.557
Here's this week's case notes
for you to transcribe.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.777
How's Rosa?

04:59.777 --> 05:02.084
Any fun tea about her
on these notes?

05:02.084 --> 05:04.042
I'm actually going to dinner
at her place tonight,

05:04.042 --> 05:06.262
so let's wrap this up.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.785
The DEA asked me

05:07.785 --> 05:10.092
to light a fire under you
while I was here.

05:10.092 --> 05:13.269
They've been breathing down
our necks for an ID on CK.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.315
I'm meeting him tomorrow.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.404
- Wait, for real?
- Yeah.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.884
Dante's bringing me along
for this week's cash drop-off.

05:19.884 --> 05:22.713
Well, contact me when you got
a name I can run with.

05:22.713 --> 05:25.107
I gotta get something
to bring to this dinner.

05:25.107 --> 05:27.675
You really bonded
with the community here, huh?

05:27.675 --> 05:29.067
That's the job.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.591
I've been going undercover
since I was a kid.

05:32.244 --> 05:34.464
Foster care.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.945
They drop you off
some new scary place,

05:36.945 --> 05:39.904
you mimic folks around you
in order to survive.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.429
Sometimes you find a friend.

05:42.429 --> 05:45.432
Speaking of, I ran
into Angie the other day.

05:45.432 --> 05:46.911
She says hi.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.305
Really?

05:50.959 --> 05:52.830
<i>I think your
duffel bag's in the garage.</i>

05:52.830 --> 05:54.397
I'll check.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.268
That's where Nico lives.

05:56.268 --> 05:58.488
Gotta give notice
before going in there.

05:58.488 --> 06:01.926
There you are.

06:01.926 --> 06:04.189
Oh, yeah.

06:09.673 --> 06:12.023
So funny thing.

06:12.023 --> 06:14.939
Nico does not consent
to a search of their domicile.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.680
So--

06:20.380 --> 06:21.685
That's mine.

06:21.685 --> 06:24.514
No kidding. But...

06:24.514 --> 06:26.124
it wasn't for me.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.474
I--

06:27.474 --> 06:28.953
I'm clean.

06:28.953 --> 06:31.695
Please, Angie, don't lie to me.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.175
I don't wanna go
on this ride again.

06:33.175 --> 06:35.090
There's no ride.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.787
I'm clean.

06:39.573 --> 06:42.227
All right, let's make us both
feel better about this.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.533
Okay, here goes.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.625
Great.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.671
Is that the last bag
of heroin in Georgia?

06:52.455 --> 06:54.109
Okay, how do I fix this
for you, Will?

06:54.109 --> 06:56.154
Go back in time.

06:56.154 --> 06:59.984
Okay? And don't bring drugs
into my house.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.725
If it's not for you,
then who's it for, huh?

07:03.466 --> 07:05.947
I can't tell you that.

07:05.947 --> 07:08.123
Look, I had a bad idea
and I'm over it.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.038
But I'm clean,
I'm telling you--

07:10.038 --> 07:12.083
Tell me!

07:15.652 --> 07:19.482
You're lying to me,

07:19.482 --> 07:20.918
and I hate it.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.183
Maybe it's a good thing
I'm leaving.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.534
Yeah, maybe it is.

07:37.282 --> 07:38.545
She doing okay?

07:38.545 --> 07:40.068
Seems like it.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.809
She wasn't shocked
to know that you've been

07:41.809 --> 07:43.506
thriving out here in Macon
with all these criminals.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.510
Just one criminal, all right?

07:47.510 --> 07:50.513
Everyone else is nice,
hardworking people.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.776
- Rosa's in nursing school.
- Love that for her.

07:52.776 --> 07:56.171
Marcos and his son Diego
are Nicaraguan refugees.

07:56.171 --> 07:57.825
Hard to imagine
what they've been through.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.740
And now they have you
as a neighbor.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.526
Get a good night's sleep,
identify CK tomorrow,

08:03.526 --> 08:04.919
and come home.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.398
Yeah?

08:12.666 --> 08:14.972
Dante, I hope
you got that bread.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.626
Oh, crap. I got busy.

08:16.626 --> 08:17.671
I'll go get it.
I'll go get it.

08:19.890 --> 08:21.196
I'll go get it.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.328
I'll go real quick.

08:23.328 --> 08:25.287
Never show up
without a gift for the host.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.637
Ah, mwah!

08:27.637 --> 08:30.205
<i>Ves,</i> Dante,
Bill has manners,

08:30.205 --> 08:32.860
and he didn't even have
a mama to teach him.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.731
Sit.
I'll bring you guys bowls.

08:34.731 --> 08:37.560
<i>I kept Bill Black's
life story close to my own.</i>

08:37.560 --> 08:39.519
<i>Makes it easier to remember.</i>

08:39.519 --> 08:42.173
<i>When Rosa found out
Bill Black was an orphan,</i>

08:42.173 --> 08:44.785
<i>she started looking his way
a little harder.</i>

08:44.785 --> 08:46.700
Bill Black, you want a beer?

08:46.700 --> 08:48.005
I'm gonna get you a beer.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.530
<i>Salud,</i> bro.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.532
You must have
so much patience

08:52.532 --> 08:54.098
working for my cousin.

08:54.098 --> 08:55.883
I'm grateful.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.538
There's not much work out there
for people in my situation.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.582
Rosa, look at this guy.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.323
Waiting for you to eat.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.020
Most polite felon I ever seen.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.152
Dante, shut up.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.936
Bill, eat.
Don't let it get cold.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.767
Gabriel, I didn't know
you were here.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.510
I stopped by
to say hi to Dad.

09:14.510 --> 09:15.729
<i>Rosa's brother.</i>

09:15.729 --> 09:17.208
<i>Doesn't live around here anymore.</i>

09:17.208 --> 09:19.471
<i>Not much love for Dante or me.</i>

09:19.471 --> 09:20.821
How's he doing?

09:20.821 --> 09:23.040
His breathing was rough
this morning.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.607
Yeah, I got him
to sit up and take some water.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.087
He was talkative.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.958
Good.
<i>Siéntate.</i>

09:27.958 --> 09:29.264
You're not leaving
without eating.

09:29.264 --> 09:30.700
I'll get you a bowl.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.354
Mmm.

09:32.354 --> 09:33.485
This is delicious.

09:33.485 --> 09:35.836
Mm, it's a secret
family recipe.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.228
You use chicken stock?

09:37.228 --> 09:38.926
- Bone broth.
- Hmm.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.101
Where'd you learn
how to cook?

09:40.101 --> 09:41.711
YouTube.

09:41.711 --> 09:44.148
Seriously?

09:44.148 --> 09:47.021
So you never knew
your parents at all?

09:47.021 --> 09:48.588
I wish I had.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.198
You know, for years,
I convinced myself

09:50.198 --> 09:52.200
my mom was a paleontologist.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.810
<i>Jurassic Park</i> generation.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.638
Yeah, you know,
I told myself she was

09:55.638 --> 09:59.773
smart, beautiful,
and on some tropical island

09:59.773 --> 10:01.339
in search of dinosaurs.

10:01.339 --> 10:04.908
Well, maybe she was
a paleontologist.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.476
Maybe she was
eaten by dinosaurs.

10:07.476 --> 10:10.044
Well, whatever she was,
she was special.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.267
Papi, you okay?

10:17.834 --> 10:19.488
She knows how to handle Dad.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.490
And he gets embarrassed.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.057
Gabriel, I need a hand!

10:23.057 --> 10:24.101
<i>Oy.</i>

10:24.101 --> 10:25.625
<i>Coma.</i>

10:39.029 --> 10:41.553
Man, I always say
I won't go too hard.

10:41.553 --> 10:44.469
Damn.
Going back to sleep after this.

10:44.469 --> 10:46.080
You good for this meeting?

10:46.080 --> 10:48.865
Hey, <i>tranquilo,</i> man.
I'm hydrating.

10:48.865 --> 10:51.172
What's up?
You worried this won't go well?

10:51.172 --> 10:52.260
You got any tips?

10:52.260 --> 10:54.088
Yeah, let CK talk.

10:54.088 --> 10:56.699
If he wants to meet you,
he knows everything about you.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.658
Hey, relax.
CK's gonna love you, man.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.270
Hey, get down!
Get down!

11:20.941 --> 11:22.072
You should go back inside.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.508
Man, I gotta
get him to school.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.075
Go back inside!

11:25.075 --> 11:27.382
Bill!
Bill.

11:28.557 --> 11:30.341
Rosa, something happened
to Dante.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.039
You're bleeding.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.344
Come up.
Come up, now. Now!

11:35.216 --> 11:36.957
Sit down.
Take off your pants.

11:38.741 --> 11:41.178
The car came out of nowhere.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.006
I'm so sorry. Um--

11:44.791 --> 11:45.879
Dante's dead.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.315
<i>Qué?</i>

11:47.315 --> 11:48.359
No.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.624
This looks like
a ricochet to me.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.890
If you go to the ER for this,
they're gonna have to report it.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.630
You were with me all morning.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.154
No, no.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.460
Don't get involved. Yes.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.636
They'll revoke your parole,
so you were with me.

12:06.421 --> 12:07.814
Hold it.

12:07.814 --> 12:08.989
All right, all right.

12:08.989 --> 12:11.818
Um, I was fixing
your leaky faucet

12:11.818 --> 12:12.993
and, um, that's the story.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.038
All right, I'm gonna need
new pants.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.518
I'll get you
a pair of my dad's.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.346
Hey, Rosa.

12:18.346 --> 12:21.175
Rosa, hey. Hey!

12:21.175 --> 12:22.654
Dante was your cousin.

12:22.654 --> 12:25.005
He's dead. Are you okay?

12:25.005 --> 12:26.093
- Rosa, are you okay?
- I don't know. I don't know!

12:26.093 --> 12:27.964
I don't know, but I'm--

12:27.964 --> 12:30.010
I'm not gonna let 'em
ruin your life too.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.663
Sheriff's department!

12:31.663 --> 12:33.491
- Open up!
- The cops are outside.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.625
Hurry up.
Y'all need to stay back.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.845
They'll start at Dante's
and then make their way over,

12:38.845 --> 12:40.411
door by door.

12:40.411 --> 12:41.456
Sheriff's office,
open up!

12:41.456 --> 12:42.805
Put on your shoes.

12:49.333 --> 12:52.467
Just in case they don't
believe the faucet thing.

12:52.467 --> 12:55.209
Come on. Let's go!

12:55.209 --> 12:56.253
All right.

12:57.385 --> 12:58.342
Step outside, please.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.303
Samantha Hagar,
Bibb County Sheriff's.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.696
- Do you live here, ma'am?
- Yes.

13:04.696 --> 13:06.873
- Can you show ID?
- Yes, I can.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.004
Hurry up.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.007
- Sir, do you live here too?
- Yeah.

13:11.007 --> 13:13.836
- Down there.
- All right. ID.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.707
I don't have one yet.
Just moved in last month.

13:16.534 --> 13:18.058
Prior address?

13:19.276 --> 13:20.669
Central State Prison.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.500
<i>Possession with intent
to distribute,</i>

13:25.500 --> 13:29.199
battery, possession of a firearm
by a convicted felon.

13:29.199 --> 13:32.812
I served my time.
I'm a rehabilitated man.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.726
My witness says the victim
had a friend with him,

13:34.726 --> 13:36.946
and he gave me a description
that sounds a lot like you.

13:36.946 --> 13:40.167
But as you know, I was fixing
my neighbor's faucet.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.298
That a euphemism?

13:46.303 --> 13:47.870
Are you kidding me,
Bill Black?

13:47.870 --> 13:49.611
You promised no trouble.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.918
Can you tell Sheriff Hagar
I'm a handyman by trade?

13:51.918 --> 13:53.223
It lines up with my alibi.

13:53.223 --> 13:55.312
Why did Dante Vasquez
have your number

13:55.312 --> 13:56.487
saved in his phone?

13:56.487 --> 13:57.837
We were neighbors.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.316
Why are you looking
in his phone anyway?

13:59.316 --> 14:00.927
- Isn't he the victim?
- It was a gang hit.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.450
Really?
Did Dante have a record?

14:02.450 --> 14:04.365
Yeah, a couple of possessions
and a DUI.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.410
That's it? You think he was
in a gang with that sheet?

14:06.410 --> 14:08.151
Why are you interrogating me?

14:08.151 --> 14:10.371
Because I want to know
who shot my neighbor.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.895
- Do your damn job!
- Okay there, Bill!

14:12.895 --> 14:14.854
Let's not forget that you're
the one with the handcuffs.

14:16.725 --> 14:19.336
I'm gonna give you five minutes
with this jackass.

14:19.336 --> 14:21.034
Either he cooperates

14:21.034 --> 14:23.950
or you violate his probation.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.255
Ooh.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.564
It's fun being
on this side of the table.

14:29.564 --> 14:30.695
I'm just saying.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.262
Okay, are you going
to prison now?

14:32.262 --> 14:33.873
Do I need to contact Amanda
and see if she can fix this?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.004
No.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.136
No, I don't want
to get out today.

14:36.136 --> 14:37.180
It'll look like I talked.

14:37.180 --> 14:39.356
Who are you
trying to impress?

14:39.356 --> 14:41.271
Your only connection
to CK is dead.

14:41.271 --> 14:42.620
Why don't we just
get you out of here?

14:42.620 --> 14:44.492
There might be
another way in.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.146
Ohh.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.930
Let me guess, Rosa?

14:47.930 --> 14:49.932
I need to see her
one more time.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.629
She knew what Dante was doing.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.240
She might have something on CK.

14:54.371 --> 14:55.982
You know you're too pretty
for prison, right?

14:55.982 --> 14:57.331
Please.

14:57.331 --> 14:58.810
I've been inside before.
But thank you.

15:06.818 --> 15:07.950
Did I miss something?

15:07.950 --> 15:10.083
Am I not violating
his probation?

15:10.083 --> 15:12.607
Apparently,
Mr. Black's attorney

15:12.607 --> 15:14.696
has convinced my higher-ups
that he is no longer

15:14.696 --> 15:16.263
a person of interest
in this matter.

15:16.263 --> 15:18.308
Okay, I'm sorry.
He has an attorney?

15:18.308 --> 15:19.701
Mm-hmm.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.357
Mmm. Mmm.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.882
Oh, what's this?
You two taking over?

15:26.882 --> 15:28.579
Okay, we just got
a visit from our union rep.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.842
Did you sustain a misconduct
complaint against us?

15:30.842 --> 15:32.192
I don't know.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.237
Did I?

15:34.237 --> 15:36.718
"An allegation that
Detectives Pulaski and Ormewood

15:36.718 --> 15:39.286
failed to provide official
business cards upon request..."

15:39.286 --> 15:40.678
"Has been investigated

15:40.678 --> 15:42.724
and sustained
by the department captain."

15:42.724 --> 15:44.291
Yeah. This rings a bell now.

15:44.291 --> 15:45.640
We got called down
to a scene--

15:45.640 --> 15:48.121
Yeah, a murder scene.
Grisly. Traumatizing.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.513
So we get there,
we're taking statements.

15:49.513 --> 15:50.906
This guy comes up to us--

15:50.906 --> 15:52.386
And he's wasted, by the way. Tanked.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.257
And he won't leave us alone,
and we are working,

15:54.257 --> 15:55.955
so we have him escorted away.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.957
Yeah, so he starts shouting
at us for the business cards

15:57.957 --> 15:59.132
because he wants
to get us in trouble.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.655
So why didn't you
give him the cards?

16:00.655 --> 16:02.396
Because he was
being mean to us!

16:02.396 --> 16:05.616
Are you--you're obligated
by a department code

16:05.616 --> 16:07.140
to give business cards
to whoever asks for it.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.358
Come on, Cap.

16:08.358 --> 16:09.577
I didn't give you
a punishment, did I?

16:09.577 --> 16:10.970
- No.
- No, but it's still

16:10.970 --> 16:12.319
- on our record.
- So?

16:12.319 --> 16:15.017
So what if I said
that we didn't hear him

16:15.017 --> 16:16.497
ask for the business cards?

16:16.497 --> 16:18.020
Well then, I'd tell you
the guy sent in

16:18.020 --> 16:21.067
supporting video evidence
along with his complaint.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.462
Guys, look.
Take the L on this.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.073
Okay? I'm moving on.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.554
Videos can be doctored, Cap.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.643
Crystal, hey.
What's going on?

16:32.643 --> 16:35.211
- Maybe this was a bad idea.
- No, no. Hey. All right.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.126
Let me find someplace
we can talk privately.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.388
All right?

16:38.388 --> 16:40.042
Um, come on.

16:42.349 --> 16:43.741
Marcos.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.613
Hey.

16:45.613 --> 16:47.441
Did your kid end up
making it to school?

16:47.441 --> 16:49.051
Man, what do you think?

16:49.051 --> 16:51.401
The cops were here asking
questions all day long.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.403
I'm sorry about that.

16:53.403 --> 16:55.449
Look, as soon as I save
enough money,

16:55.449 --> 16:57.277
I'm gonna move him
far away from here.

16:57.277 --> 17:00.541
Until then,
just leave us alone.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.895
I hate that I've been shot at
enough times in my life

17:06.895 --> 17:09.767
that I can make
calm observations about it.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.075
I saw it coming.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.252
<i>But I barely took cover.
I should have been hit.</i>

17:18.515 --> 17:22.041
<i>The stray gunfire was clustered
on Dante's far side.</i>

17:22.041 --> 17:25.435
<i>They made he sure he was dead
and I stayed alive.</i>

17:25.435 --> 17:29.265
If this was retaliation,
the motive was personal.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.093
Meanwhile,
some lawyer I never met

17:31.093 --> 17:32.877
is making sure
I stay out of prison.

17:35.141 --> 17:38.231
I don't know where CK is,

17:38.231 --> 17:39.928
but he's watching me.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.282
<i>Hello?</i>

17:46.282 --> 17:47.805
Hey, I pulled
your release paperwork.

17:47.805 --> 17:50.852
The lawyer who got you out
was Wallace Kim.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.419
- Never heard of him.
- Yeah, I did some digging.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.073
He's a pretty big deal
in Macon.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.684
But this is the detail
that's gonna make you flip out.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.729
A couple of years ago,
he represented your friend

17:58.729 --> 18:00.557
Rosa in a civil dispute.

18:00.557 --> 18:01.776
<i>They're connected.</i>

18:01.776 --> 18:03.169
Guess I better go talk to her.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.867
Mm.
You hate that, don't you?

18:05.867 --> 18:06.911
Let me know what she says, okay?

18:06.911 --> 18:08.565
And Will, be careful.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.106
Uh!

18:33.460 --> 18:37.290
Okay, Bill.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.726
let's try to sort things out.

18:40.510 --> 18:41.511
Could I have you stand up?

18:43.557 --> 18:44.775
Take off your shirt and pants.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.779
What did you say to the cops?

18:48.779 --> 18:50.303
I didn't have time
to say much.

18:52.348 --> 18:54.481
Do I have you to thank
for the lawyer?

18:54.481 --> 18:57.005
Well, that was courtesy of CK.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.183
Well, I'd love to thank him
in person,

19:01.183 --> 19:02.619
if that's not too much trouble.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.542
That's a whole lot of history
written all over you.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.372
Anything in particular
you're curious about?

19:16.372 --> 19:17.852
Uh-uh.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.070
But you can put
your clothes back on.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.466
So Dante says
you're good people.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.686
He told CK you were worth
bringing into the family.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.253
Yeah?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.298
That would have been a lot more
flattering before today.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.387
Yeah? What that mean?

19:31.387 --> 19:33.215
It's the hat.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.999
Hard to forget.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.914
You were driving the car
that shot Dante.

19:36.914 --> 19:39.787
Dante's big mouth
put us on the DEA's radar

19:39.787 --> 19:41.919
a couple months ago.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.748
Dante tried
to pull it together, but--

19:44.748 --> 19:46.097
Yeah, he wasn't
cut out for this.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.621
Nope.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.536
Didn't even know he was
training his own replacement.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.102
Oh, is that a job offer?

19:51.102 --> 19:53.757
You're still
in the application phase.

19:53.757 --> 19:57.283
Next phase might get
a little ugly.

19:57.283 --> 20:00.895
Whatever CK needs, I'm in.

20:00.895 --> 20:02.723
But I want to meet him.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.772
Bill, if you were running

20:08.772 --> 20:12.211
Macon's most notorious
drug operation,

20:12.211 --> 20:13.951
would you go around
meeting people?

20:15.562 --> 20:18.565
Okay, so what's up?

20:18.565 --> 20:20.828
He took my mom and I
to the Illuminarium.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.874
We'd eat at Old Lady Gang.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.528
My mom loves
<i>Housewives of Atlanta.</i>

20:26.790 --> 20:28.923
But a few days ago, he--

20:31.839 --> 20:33.014
He what?

20:34.668 --> 20:35.843
He started coming
into my room

20:35.843 --> 20:37.366
at night when I'm sleeping.

20:38.367 --> 20:39.934
Is he touching you?

20:42.153 --> 20:44.286
Just, like,

20:44.286 --> 20:46.462
rubbing my legs and stuff.

20:46.462 --> 20:49.509
It's pretty creepy.

20:49.509 --> 20:52.163
I tried telling my mom,
but she--

20:52.163 --> 20:53.730
she doesn't want to hear it.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.558
Hey, you did the right thing
coming here.

20:56.994 --> 20:59.170
Okay?

20:59.170 --> 21:01.085
Hey. Hey.

21:01.085 --> 21:02.130
You're okay.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.132
You're all right.

21:04.132 --> 21:06.265
Okay?
You're all right.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.353
Ugh.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.792
Can you arrest him
for touching my leg?

21:11.792 --> 21:14.142
Um, it's--it's gonna
be all right.

21:14.142 --> 21:15.448
I promise.

21:15.448 --> 21:18.146
I just need you
to do me a favor.

21:18.146 --> 21:21.149
Can you go stay at a friend's
house for a few days?

21:21.149 --> 21:22.890
You know, just tell your mom
that you have to work

21:22.890 --> 21:24.239
on a school project
or something.

21:24.239 --> 21:25.762
Yeah. Okay.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.634
Okay.
And what about your mom?

21:27.634 --> 21:29.026
Is she home during the day?

21:29.026 --> 21:31.072
No. She works all day.

21:31.072 --> 21:34.641
So you go straight from here
to your friend's house,

21:34.641 --> 21:37.600
don't go home,
borrow clothes,

21:37.600 --> 21:39.776
whatever you have to, okay?

21:39.776 --> 21:41.517
Okay.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.265
<i>I mean, you see
why I gotta do it, right?</i>

21:50.265 --> 21:53.399
I can't--I can't let him
get his hands on that girl.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.922
I'm doing the world a favor.

21:57.794 --> 22:01.972
I could do without
the judgy eyes.

22:01.972 --> 22:05.019
Yeah, I'm going through with it
whether you cosign or not.

22:08.544 --> 22:10.546
And then I'll let Will go.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.203
I promise.
I promise.

22:15.203 --> 22:16.944
I will.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.685
And you'll take care of him.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.689
<i>♪ Hello, hello, hello</i>

22:22.689 --> 22:24.734
We've come a long way,
you and me.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.957
I'll miss our little talks.

22:29.957 --> 22:33.221
<i>♪ And I thought about
the things you used to say ♪</i>

22:33.221 --> 22:36.529
<i>♪ And I thought about

22:36.529 --> 22:39.358
Hey, can you meet?

22:41.185 --> 22:42.448
What's up?
You shouldn't be here.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.885
What are you doing?

22:44.885 --> 22:48.105
<i>♪ I ain't even my own</i>

22:48.105 --> 22:50.847

22:50.847 --> 22:54.068

23:25.752 --> 23:28.232
- That was hot.
- Yeah.

23:28.232 --> 23:29.799
You didn't see that coming,
did you?

23:29.799 --> 23:31.627
- Mm.
- I couldn't restrain myself

23:31.627 --> 23:34.238
when I saw you in a hoodie.

23:34.238 --> 23:36.415
We should have thought of this
Bill Black thing years ago.

23:41.463 --> 23:45.467
I've, been, uh--I've been
thinking about you a lot.

23:45.467 --> 23:50.603
You know, um,
the distance, it, um--

23:50.603 --> 23:51.821
it's been good.

23:53.301 --> 23:54.911
Given me some clarity.

23:57.958 --> 23:59.916
Is that why you didn't
make me pee in a cup

23:59.916 --> 24:01.396
before we did this?

24:03.920 --> 24:07.489
If I don't ask any questions,

24:07.489 --> 24:08.882
I won't get any lies.

24:11.406 --> 24:14.148
You're taking care
of yourself for once.

24:14.148 --> 24:15.628
You'll have to tell me
what that's like.

24:18.152 --> 24:20.502
It's work.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.286
Well, I'm glad you came.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.506
Me too.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.116
What happened?

24:26.116 --> 24:27.988
Um, nothing.

24:27.988 --> 24:30.860
Just a sucker punch
to the kidney.

24:30.860 --> 24:33.428
But I passed the test.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.299
Of course you did.

24:35.299 --> 24:37.432
You always come through.

24:37.432 --> 24:38.694
You always will.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.480
You close on this?

24:43.612 --> 24:45.919
Last few days been intense.

24:45.919 --> 24:48.878
Feels like something big's
in motion.

24:48.878 --> 24:52.316
Maybe the final step
before I meet CK.

24:55.319 --> 24:57.931
What?

24:57.931 --> 25:00.847
I feel bad for CK.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.544
He's literally the only guy
in the world

25:02.544 --> 25:05.373
that can't trust Will Trent.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.897
Mm.

25:07.897 --> 25:09.682
As long as he trusts
Bill Black.

25:09.682 --> 25:12.423
Mm-hmm.

25:12.423 --> 25:15.644
I've been thinking about
how lucky I am.

25:15.644 --> 25:17.124
Everything I've
been through, I--

25:19.866 --> 25:21.650
I wouldn't have made it
without you.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.263
Not everyone is so lucky.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.839
I should go.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.756
I don't need anyone
wondering where I went.

25:44.673 --> 25:45.805
Okay.

25:59.383 --> 26:01.037
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:01.037 --> 26:02.517
How's Angie?

26:02.517 --> 26:03.562
Why you asking?

26:05.215 --> 26:07.174
Elevator talk?
I don't know.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.132
Forget it.

26:09.132 --> 26:11.178
She's okay.
She's fine.

26:11.178 --> 26:12.527
She's good.

26:15.443 --> 26:17.140
I don't know.
She's acting weird.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.533
Something's up.

26:18.533 --> 26:19.708
You don't think
she's using again?

26:19.708 --> 26:21.144
No. I don't think so.

26:21.144 --> 26:23.712
She's just off.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.409
What should I do?

26:25.409 --> 26:27.368
Well, she's your partner.

26:27.368 --> 26:28.630
Have her back.

26:29.718 --> 26:30.893
Yeah.

26:30.893 --> 26:32.155
Okay.

26:33.940 --> 26:35.202
Good talk.

26:37.770 --> 26:38.727
Okay.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.383
What are you gonna do
for money now?

26:42.383 --> 26:44.864
I mean, you and Dante, you guys
were working together, right?

26:46.953 --> 26:49.912
Yeah.
Um, I'll be all right.

26:49.912 --> 26:51.522
People always need a handyman.

26:51.522 --> 26:52.611
Pretty good at fixing things.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.177
Oh?

26:54.177 --> 26:58.312
And how does a pretty good
handyman end up in prison?

26:58.312 --> 27:01.358
Circumstances and choices.

27:01.358 --> 27:02.925
I had needs, basic ones,

27:02.925 --> 27:05.885
and was presented
with a solution.

27:05.885 --> 27:08.104
Any regrets?

27:08.104 --> 27:09.105
Just learned lessons.

27:10.846 --> 27:13.675
My mom worked at a doctor's
office in East Macon.

27:13.675 --> 27:16.460
And one day,
as a favor for a friend,

27:16.460 --> 27:18.462
she snuck out some painkillers.

27:18.462 --> 27:21.640
And then she started doing it
a little more and a little more.

27:23.293 --> 27:24.207
And one day, they got her.

27:24.207 --> 27:25.731
Mm-hmm.

27:25.731 --> 27:28.864
But she put us
through college.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.126
You do what you
gotta do to survive.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.088
You get it.

27:39.701 --> 27:43.749
Rosa, um, did you know
any of the guys

27:43.749 --> 27:46.447
Dante was working for?

27:46.447 --> 27:47.796
Why do you ask?

27:50.494 --> 27:52.583
Does your dad need some help?

27:52.583 --> 27:54.368
No, I just need
to give him a pill.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.327
You hold that thought.

27:58.764 --> 28:01.244
<i>That's not the way
Rosa would treat family.</i>

28:01.244 --> 28:04.334
<i>If that was really her father,
she wouldn't be so callous.</i>

28:25.704 --> 28:27.706
Sir, what's your name?

28:28.881 --> 28:30.665
Menaker.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.757
From DEA.

28:38.107 --> 28:40.762
Agent Menaker, my name's
Special Agent Will Trent.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.155
I'm gonna get you home, okay?

28:49.858 --> 28:52.818
He, uh, just needed
a little adjustment.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.776
No pill needed.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.778
Maybe you're the one who
should be in nursing school.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.519
You're not in
nursing school, Rosa.

29:04.481 --> 29:06.657
Anything else you wanna
tell me about myself?

29:10.096 --> 29:12.185
You're CK.

29:12.185 --> 29:14.274
Nice to finally meet you.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.841
I wish you wouldn't have
done that, Bill.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.320
Who's the guy in the bed?

29:17.320 --> 29:18.974
DEA had a guy on us.

29:18.974 --> 29:20.367
They found Dante.

29:20.367 --> 29:21.803
Thought they could scare me
out into the open.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.413
So you took him?
Mm-hmm.

29:23.413 --> 29:24.632
Right off the street.

29:24.632 --> 29:25.894
Broad daylight.

29:25.894 --> 29:27.809
He was a fountain
of information.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.245
And they haven't
bothered us since.

29:31.595 --> 29:33.423
Whoa.

29:33.423 --> 29:34.816
What's going on here?

29:34.816 --> 29:36.122
Bill found our little guest.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.037
Ah, snooping?

29:38.037 --> 29:39.429
Sounded like a bad cough.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.301
Went in to check in
on your dad.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.656
Rosa, you can trust me.

29:48.656 --> 29:50.179
You want me to trust you?

29:50.179 --> 29:52.051
Prove yourself.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.531
You want me to kill a guy
who's basically already dead?

29:54.531 --> 29:58.057
The gal downstairs,
does coke with Dante, kill her.

29:59.232 --> 30:01.538
She does this for hours a day.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.584
Hundreds of people watching.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.629
If she says something
about our business--

30:07.501 --> 30:08.676
We just got
the sheriff out of here.

30:08.676 --> 30:10.025
You wanna drop another body?

30:10.025 --> 30:11.766
We have cleaners
that can handle them.

30:11.766 --> 30:14.029
Nobody found Menaker,
did they?

30:14.029 --> 30:15.596
All right.

30:15.596 --> 30:16.684
Give me a gun.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.468
Mm-mm.
Use a knife.

30:19.556 --> 30:22.472
This is the test, Bill.

30:22.472 --> 30:25.040
Gabriel, go with him.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.434
You'll give our friend
in the bedroom his fatal dose?

30:27.434 --> 30:29.436
Mm-hmm.
And I'll be watching too.

30:33.266 --> 30:34.876
Hmm.

30:43.232 --> 30:44.494
You want a show?

30:46.018 --> 30:47.193
Be right back.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.073
I don't want
to see you again.

30:58.073 --> 30:59.205
Get the--
Now, settle down.

30:59.205 --> 31:00.684
Get out!
Listen--

31:00.684 --> 31:02.121
Don't touch me!
You're making a big deal

31:02.121 --> 31:03.296
out of nothing
Get out of my house!

31:03.296 --> 31:04.645
Shut up!
Shut up!

31:04.645 --> 31:05.602
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Get out!

31:05.602 --> 31:07.256
Get out of my house!
Get out!

31:07.256 --> 31:08.562
Hey. Shh.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.913
You gotta be kidding me.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.349
Why the hell did you call her?

31:13.349 --> 31:14.960
You know she's out
for my blood.

31:14.960 --> 31:15.961
I didn't call her!
- Hey, hey--

31:15.961 --> 31:17.484
- Get out!
- What happened here?

31:17.484 --> 31:19.094
- I didn't touch her.
- Hey, what happened here?

31:19.094 --> 31:22.315
I came home from work early,
and I found him.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.143
He was touching her.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.972
No, no, no, no, no.
We were just playing around.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.364
isn't that right, Crystal?

31:28.364 --> 31:29.539
Crystal, what happened?

31:29.539 --> 31:31.541
I just wanted my book bag.

31:31.541 --> 31:33.630
Okay.
Can you tell me what happened?

31:35.806 --> 31:38.897
He--he--

31:40.376 --> 31:42.291
- I'm sorry!
- It's okay, sweetheart.

31:42.291 --> 31:44.337
It's all right.
It's not your fault. okay?

31:44.337 --> 31:45.555
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

31:45.555 --> 31:46.774
You need to leave!
Ahh!

31:55.348 --> 31:56.827
One move and I shoot.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.003
Lenny Broussard,
you're under arrest.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.830
Anything you say can
and will be used--

31:59.830 --> 32:00.962
Ahh!

32:00.962 --> 32:03.182
Oh, my God! Ohh!

32:03.182 --> 32:04.879
Oh, no.

32:09.231 --> 32:11.277
Nobody move!
Nobody move.

32:11.277 --> 32:13.235
What should we do?

32:13.235 --> 32:14.497
You need to leave.

32:14.497 --> 32:17.892
You--you need to, uh,
go to the mall.

32:17.892 --> 32:18.893
See the first movie
that's showing.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.199
Okay? You weren't here.

32:20.199 --> 32:21.635
- But we--
- No, I killed Lenny.

32:21.635 --> 32:24.986
You were not here.
Okay?

32:24.986 --> 32:27.684
Okay, tell me what happened.
Where were you?

32:27.684 --> 32:29.077
Where were you?

32:29.077 --> 32:30.513
Crystal and I
were at the movies.

32:30.513 --> 32:34.387
Okay, now go.
Go, go, go.

32:39.435 --> 32:41.481
Okay.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.962
Oh, this is not where
I planned on this going,

32:43.962 --> 32:47.052
but at least you're dead,
you son of a bitch.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.228
Leaving me another mess
to clean up, huh?

32:49.228 --> 32:50.751
I'm not gonna let you
ruin this girl's life.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.405
I'm not gonna let you do that.

32:52.405 --> 32:55.016
I gotta--okay.

32:55.016 --> 32:56.452
<i>♪ It seems so sad
when you look back ♪</i>

32:56.452 --> 32:58.193
Okay.

32:58.193 --> 32:59.629
<i>♪ Seems so sad

32:59.629 --> 33:00.935
<i>♪ Seems so sad

33:26.047 --> 33:27.092
Anywho, I'm flying to New York.

33:27.092 --> 33:28.528
I'm so excited.
I've never left--

33:31.618 --> 33:32.967
<i>Hold on.</i>

33:38.973 --> 33:41.280
Hi, Bill.
I'm in the middle of something.

33:53.422 --> 33:54.684
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't, don't! Please!

33:54.684 --> 33:55.990
<i>Please! Please!</i>

34:05.739 --> 34:07.610
My name's not Bill Black.

34:07.610 --> 34:10.309
I'm Special Agent Will Trent
with the GBI.

34:10.309 --> 34:11.788
There's a drug dealer
trying to kill you,

34:11.788 --> 34:13.834
but I'm not gonna
let that happen.

34:13.834 --> 34:16.097
Do you have a rope, twine?

34:16.097 --> 34:17.316
Something I could
tie him up with?

34:19.231 --> 34:20.580
Got a pair of tights.

34:20.580 --> 34:21.755
Perfect.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.193
You know, a lot of people are
gonna think I'm dead now.

34:25.193 --> 34:26.629
I hope so.

34:26.629 --> 34:28.414
That's kinda the point.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.894
I need you recall the GBI,
ask for Faith Mitchell.

34:30.894 --> 34:32.635
All right?
Tell her we need help.

34:32.635 --> 34:35.073
Um, you got naloxone?

34:35.073 --> 34:36.378
It's the stuff used
a reverse drug overdose.

34:37.988 --> 34:38.989
Yes.

34:40.513 --> 34:43.037
Here. Anything else?

34:43.037 --> 34:44.343
Um, you got a car?

34:44.343 --> 34:45.518
No, it got towed
three months ago

34:45.518 --> 34:46.867
and I don't have
the money to fix it.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.303
Can you do something
about that?

34:48.303 --> 34:49.435
Listen to me.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.393
Courtyards are being watched.

34:51.393 --> 34:53.569
Lock your doors.
Don't make a sound.

34:53.569 --> 34:54.788
Bad guys think you're dead.

35:12.545 --> 35:15.156
I'm sorry I made you do that.

35:15.156 --> 35:16.723
I just needed to know
that you could.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.599
Step over here.

35:23.599 --> 35:25.775
Hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back!

35:25.775 --> 35:27.081
- Where's Gabriel?
- Don't move!

35:27.081 --> 35:29.214
Bill, where's my brother?

35:29.214 --> 35:31.303
- All right, come over here.
- Is he dead?

35:31.303 --> 35:34.262
Sit. Just sit.
He's alive, all right?

35:34.262 --> 35:36.395
So you're a cop?
You're a cop?

35:36.395 --> 35:38.745
Shut up.

35:38.745 --> 35:41.356
My cleaners are gonna be here
before anybody you called.

35:41.356 --> 35:43.924
He's got maybe a minute,
you have maybe five.

35:43.924 --> 35:46.100
I let you into my home,

35:46.100 --> 35:47.449
into my family.

35:47.449 --> 35:48.537
I thought we understood
each other.

35:48.537 --> 35:49.756
Okay.

35:49.756 --> 35:51.236
And I did go
to nursing school.

35:51.236 --> 35:52.759
Agent Menaker,
can you hear me?

35:52.759 --> 35:54.891
Well, you know what?
I'm not ashamed of what I do.

35:54.891 --> 35:57.938
It must be so lonely
living with all your lies.

35:57.938 --> 36:01.115
Will you shut up? Come on.

36:01.115 --> 36:03.030
You know,
everything I was offering you,

36:03.030 --> 36:06.381
even though you judged me
for it,

36:06.381 --> 36:08.818
it was real.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.820
I know it was, Rosa.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.996
It just wasn't for me.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.781
Come on.

36:48.597 --> 36:50.251
Will, over here!
I got a car!

36:52.297 --> 36:53.428
Come on, get in.

36:57.084 --> 36:58.433
Where's your son?
Is he safe?

36:58.433 --> 37:00.827
At school. Hurry up.
911 doesn't come here.

37:00.827 --> 37:01.915
You're GBI?

37:01.915 --> 37:04.700
Special Agent Will Trent.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.441
Yeah. That's me.

37:09.270 --> 37:10.663
There they are!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

37:31.249 --> 37:32.293
Angie?

37:33.947 --> 37:35.514
Jesus.

37:38.734 --> 37:40.258
What are you doing here?

37:40.258 --> 37:42.695
Well, I thought my partner
might be in trouble.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.827
You all right?
What happened?

37:44.827 --> 37:46.873
I'm fine.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.310
I came to do
a wellness check on Crystal,

37:49.310 --> 37:52.444
and, uh, he attacked me.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.402
I didn't even say anything.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.191
Walk me through this.

38:01.191 --> 38:05.457
Uh, he--
he pinned me down,

38:05.457 --> 38:08.634
he was hitting me over
and over with the rolling pin,

38:08.634 --> 38:11.419
and I, uh--

38:11.419 --> 38:13.203
I reached for that knife
and I--

38:13.203 --> 38:15.815
I stabbed him in the neck.

38:15.815 --> 38:20.515
Right, so you called a time-out
to go grab kitchen weapons,

38:20.515 --> 38:21.560
and for some reason
he passed up the knife

38:21.560 --> 38:24.171
for the rolling pin?

38:24.171 --> 38:26.869
Not to mention that he had you
pinned down before--

38:26.869 --> 38:29.219
well, judging from the upcoming
carpet bill--

38:29.219 --> 38:30.917
you severed his carotid artery.

38:34.486 --> 38:36.618
Anyone else would've been
showered in blood,

38:36.618 --> 38:37.837
but you're not.

38:42.407 --> 38:43.538
I'm new to this.

38:45.061 --> 38:46.280
Yeah.

38:46.280 --> 38:49.544
Well, we've got
a lot of work to do

38:49.544 --> 38:51.416
if we're gonna make the scene
match that statement.

38:59.902 --> 39:00.947
Stop.

39:00.947 --> 39:02.383
Don't come in here.

39:02.383 --> 39:05.343
Bill Black looks like
he needs a shower.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.822
Bill Black's
officially retired.

39:06.822 --> 39:08.476
For now.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.696
That's too good a name
to retire forever.

39:10.696 --> 39:12.045
Why?
Because you came up with it?

39:12.045 --> 39:13.916
Well, you took down CK.

39:13.916 --> 39:15.396
They've got Rosa in custody.

39:15.396 --> 39:17.572
And I just heard the DEA raided
that safe house

39:17.572 --> 39:19.139
you told them about.

39:19.139 --> 39:20.923
Between the physical evidence
and Menaker's testimony,

39:20.923 --> 39:22.882
CK is cooked.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.840
How is Agent Menaker?

39:24.840 --> 39:26.494
Well, he'll be in detox
for a while

39:26.494 --> 39:28.453
from the fentanyl
they had him on.

39:28.453 --> 39:29.932
But his family is happy
to have him home.

39:32.152 --> 39:33.153
That's great.

39:33.153 --> 39:36.461
I'm, uh--
I'm happy for them.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.463
You're home too, Will.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.465
Go put on a three-piece suit
and relax.

39:40.465 --> 39:42.205
Actually, I'm gonna
go to the hospital

39:42.205 --> 39:43.729
to check up on Angie.

39:43.729 --> 39:46.079
Did you know about
this Lenny Broussard guy?

39:47.689 --> 39:49.343
I did.

39:49.343 --> 39:53.129
But, um, I haven't heard
that name in a long time.

39:55.131 --> 39:58.874
And that's when I called
Detective Ormewood for backup.

40:00.659 --> 40:03.183
Do you mind giving me
a few minutes?

40:08.754 --> 40:11.974
<i>♪ So close

40:11.974 --> 40:14.629
I'm fine. Believe me.

40:14.629 --> 40:17.110
You should see the other guy.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.199
So Lenny.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.290
That was the thing
you couldn't tell me about?

40:23.290 --> 40:25.292
<i>♪ And nothing else matters</i>

40:25.292 --> 40:26.946
Yeah, because there was
nothing to tell.

40:26.946 --> 40:29.688
I was just watching him.

40:29.688 --> 40:34.736
And there was no problem
until he attacked me.

40:34.736 --> 40:38.479
<i>♪ Life is ours,
we live it our way ♪</i>

40:38.479 --> 40:41.917
I was wrong about the heroin.

40:43.919 --> 40:45.965
Your bad idea was
to have Lenny OD.

40:49.359 --> 40:50.491
But something happened.

40:52.928 --> 40:54.452
What was it?

40:54.452 --> 40:55.714
<i>♪ Never cared
for what they say ♪</i>

40:55.714 --> 40:59.195
I went over there
to check on Crystal.

40:59.195 --> 41:00.458
I stabbed him.

41:02.024 --> 41:03.896
I watched him bleed out
in front of me.

41:03.896 --> 41:08.466
<i>♪ Never cared
for what they do ♪</i>

41:08.466 --> 41:09.815
I'm sorry about
the other night.

41:09.815 --> 41:11.599
The next time I want
a one-night stand,

41:11.599 --> 41:13.514
I'll do it the old-fashioned way
and just go to a bar.

41:18.824 --> 41:21.391
When I get out of here,
I should come over

41:21.391 --> 41:24.046
and pick up my stuff.

41:28.398 --> 41:29.530
Do what you got to do, Ange.

41:35.014 --> 41:39.975

41:39.975 --> 41:44.023
