I can't pay you.

04:27.268 --> 04:30.886
I'm just getting
cost covered as it is. I can't afford you.

Not for pay?

04:35.484 --> 04:39.068
Why would you do it without getting paid?

04:39.155 --> 04:43.945
Because I'm a giver.
I give, and I give, and I give.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.367
Come on, face the facts.

04:47.455 --> 04:50.447
Look, I've lived almost half my life,

04:50.583 --> 04:53.575
if I'm honest, wasting a quarter of it.

04:53.669 --> 04:54.704
What do I have to show, huh?

I'm a part-time diskjockey,
a part-time musician,

05:00.217 --> 05:03.254
a part-time lover of extraordinary women

05:03.345 --> 05:05.802

05:05.890 --> 05:08.302

I'm not settling. I mean,
not any more than you are.

05:11.729 --> 05:17.144
(SIGHS) I'm just saying,
it's time for me to go full-time in life.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.815
You're scaring me, Davis.

05:18.903 --> 05:21.315
I mean, where's the Davis McAlary who said,

05:21.405 --> 05:24.238
"Any job on which
you can't be seen with a |itjoint

05:24.325 --> 05:26.031

05:33.417 --> 05:34.702
Let me do this.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.876
All right, Davis.

05:39.924 --> 05:42.916
I need you there at 5:30.

To where?

Back to the Eighth as requested.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.535
Effective after the holiday.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.623
You'll also be happy to
know that I've been asked by the Chief

06:23.717 --> 06:26.129
to oversee an internal initiative aimed

06:26.303 --> 06:28.715
at reducing departmental corruption.

06:28.806 --> 06:31.548
An internal initiative?

06:31.642 --> 06:35.510
Policing ourselves under
your discerning eye, huh, Chief?

06:36.897 --> 06:37.886
Too late.

06:37.982 --> 06:39.188
What?

06:39.316 --> 06:40.522
Too little too late.

06:40.609 --> 06:45.319
I'm testifying, Deputy. Tomorrow, in fact.

LAWYER: Here, here,
and here. I need a full signature right there.

07:01.005 --> 07:02.541
It's gonna be quite a medical center.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.254
With a biotech component.

Now that we're unburdening
you of all this New Orleans real estate,

07:19.064 --> 07:22.147
I'm guessing that
the last order of business for Nelson Hidalgo

07:22.234 --> 07:24.270
is to see the Jazz Center get the green light.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.444
That would frost the cake, wouldn't it?

07:27.531 --> 07:28.862
-Thank you.
-Where's that project now?

07:37.041 --> 07:38.702
Don't know. Could be rocky.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.124
You gonna be there at the Times-Pic?

07:41.754 --> 07:44.370
Too much profile for me.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.205
When was your flight back to Galveston?

07:46.884 --> 07:48.590
I know you've got your hands full there.

I'm out this afternoon, but I can fly back,

So, you're not busy on Mardi Gras day.

-Hey.

It's a little generic, isn't it?

10:01.894 --> 10:03.475
Are you sure we don't have it 'cause Alison

10:03.604 --> 10:05.140
or Emmylou threw it back on the pile?

10:05.647 --> 10:07.729
You've got something to bring to it.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.190
I'm staying in the apartment above the bar

so I can get a place for me and the boys.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.243

I'll talk to Desiree.

is they just don't seem to care what we write.

Can't go to court, I can't really be a cop.

28:19.949 --> 28:23.282

it all out, they can punish me.

28:27.623 --> 28:30.239

you're doing doesn't matter anymore

37:48.267 --> 37:50.633

37:53.981 --> 37:55.562
No, Marvin. Listen to me.

37:55.649 --> 37:58.436
I gave up the band, and I followed you here.

37:58.527 --> 38:01.485
And I'm willing to try and make
music the way you think I should.

38:01.905 --> 38:04.442
Maybe my band wasn't pretty enough.

38:04.575 --> 38:07.112
Maybe they sounded a little too Louisiana.

38:07.202 --> 38:08.783
Maybe we had a ceiling because of that.

38:08.871 --> 38:12.363
And maybe it's worth
trying something a little more mainstream

38:12.458 --> 38:15.120
and tarting it up some. We'll see.

my fucking music that I'm making.

38:21.550 --> 38:24.041
that I make, that I wanna play,

38:25.053 --> 38:26.793
what the fuck is the point?

38:28.557 --> 38:29.672
I'm serious.

38:29.808 --> 38:30.888
I see that.

38:33.061 --> 38:37.896
Okay. The final decisions
on your music stay with you,

38:39.109 --> 38:41.771
for better or worse.

38:41.862 --> 38:44.228
Now what stays with me and the people I pick

38:44.406 --> 38:46.772
is the marketing, promotion, and image.

38:46.867 --> 38:51.327
If I give you the songs,
then you give me the package.

38:51.413 --> 38:54.655

a Feeny restaurant
will be a part of it. You have my word.

1:00:30.211 --> 1:00:31.667
l have one thing to ask in return.

1:00:33.088 --> 1:00:34.339
Name it.

1:00:34.423 --> 1:00:37.711
I had a long
talk with Woodrow. He's chomping at the bit.

1:00:37.802 --> 1:00:40.043
Can't wait till I get back up there.

1:00:40.137 --> 1:00:42.002
I mean, it makes sense
for me to be based in New York.

1:00:42.097 --> 1:00:43.962
There's no place down here
for me to play my music.

1:00:44.058 --> 1:00:46.595
Are we gonna find a place in Manhattan?

1:00:46.685 --> 1:00:50.052
I'm thinking Brooklyn.
More bang for your buck.

1:00:50.564 --> 1:00:52.395
We'll need two bedrooms.

1:00:54.985 --> 1:00:57.818
I want to have the baby here, Del.

1:00:57.905 --> 1:00:58.985
I figured.

1:00:59.073 --> 1:01:01.314
Your mama, your doctor.

1:01:08.374 --> 1:01:13.243
I promised my daddy
we'd raise him or her up in the tradition.

1:01:16.006 --> 1:01:19.999
So, we keep a foot in both places, right?

1:01:20.803 --> 1:01:22.043
Always.

1:01:28.352 --> 1:01:30.889
But how? He hates me so much.

1:01:30.980 --> 1:01:33.687
He likes money more.

1:01:33.774 --> 1:01:35.435
What'd you give him?

1:01:35.609 --> 1:01:37.270
100% of nothing.

1:01:40.614 --> 1:01:41.729
You know something?

1:01:41.824 --> 1:01:45.658
I spent time in this town, made a lot of money.

1:01:45.744 --> 1:01:48.406
And a friend of mine, a cousin, actually,

1:01:48.539 --> 1:01:51.155
once asked me if I ever built anything,

1:01:51.250 --> 1:01:55.118
or if anything ever got fixed
for all that I got paid.

1:01:58.340 --> 1:01:59.750
When you put your sign up,

1:01:59.842 --> 1:02:01.503
take a little penknife, carve my initials

1:02:01.635 --> 1:02:03.296
in the bottom of that sucker, okay?

1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:06.716
I'll do more than that.

1:02:06.807 --> 1:02:09.219
You got this corner table
any time you want it, gratis.

1:02:09.310 --> 1:02:13.644
Oh, no, darling,
I pay for my meals. And I tip excessively.

1:02:13.731 --> 1:02:15.062
Never worry the little stuff.

1:02:17.526 --> 1:02:18.732
Mmm.

1:02:19.820 --> 1:02:21.321
AII right. (SIGHS)

1:02:22.239 --> 1:02:24.776
Gotta go. I'm in the wrong town.

1:02:24.867 --> 1:02:26.573
TOBY: Godzilla versus King Kong.

1:02:26.660 --> 1:02:29.151
It's a flawed analogy, Davis.

1:02:31.248 --> 1:02:34.490
If Fess is M.L.K.,

1:02:34.585 --> 1:02:36.576
Booker is Gandhi.

1:02:36.670 --> 1:02:37.830
(LAUGHING)

1:02:39.465 --> 1:02:43.925
So the Mahatma
is the Civil Rights equivalent of Godzilla.

1:02:44.011 --> 1:02:45.797
Indeed.

1:02:45.930 --> 1:02:47.636
Okay, Godzilla versus M.L.K.

1:02:47.723 --> 1:02:49.088
-Who wins?
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:02:49.642 --> 1:02:50.757
That's a lyric.

1:02:50.851 --> 1:02:52.011
No! That's a song!

1:02:52.144 --> 1:02:53.259
Oh, God, here we go.

1:02:53.354 --> 1:02:56.437
Shit! That's a concept album.

1:02:57.608 --> 1:02:59.690
Right? Right?

1:03:00.319 --> 1:03:01.354
What the fuck did I just say?

1:03:01.445 --> 1:03:04.687

Long before this world was my home

1:03:36.897 --> 1:03:39.138
I gotta go, gotta go

1:03:39.233 --> 1:03:42.350

1:03:43.487 --> 1:03:49.198

1:03:50.411 --> 1:03:55.701

Thank you so much, you guys. Thank you.

1:04:14.018 --> 1:04:16.009
That one will be on our new record,

1:04:16.145 --> 1:04:18.101
which will be out
this summer, we hope. (GIGGLES)

1:04:20.733 --> 1:04:24.396
You know what? It's so good
to be back in New Orleans after so long.

1:04:24.486 --> 1:04:28.695
I have so many friends down here that I miss,

1:04:28.782 --> 1:04:30.738
and actually, I see one of them right now.

1:04:31.827 --> 1:04:33.943
It's my oldest friend here.

1:04:34.038 --> 1:04:38.532
He's the one who dragged me to New
Orleans and made me love the place.

1:04:40.794 --> 1:04:43.456
This one is for him.

1:04:43.547 --> 1:04:45.708
All right, you Nashville hotshots,

1:04:45.799 --> 1:04:48.882
every busker down here
can play this one in, like, five different keys.

1:04:48.969 --> 1:04:50.960
So we can do this.

You fly through my head

1:05:18.832 --> 1:05:21.323
Like wine

1:05:22.753 --> 1:05:26.621
You wrecked the life

1:05:26.715 --> 1:05:30.674
Of many poor girls

1:05:31.512 --> 1:05:35.596

1:06:00.707 --> 1:06:05.326
A many true vow

1:06:05.420 --> 1:06:09.754
Then you set my very soul

1:06:37.077 --> 1:06:38.738

Your shows, they've been good.

1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:49.336
Why would you say something like that?

1:06:49.423 --> 1:06:51.664
Why would you go there
when you know how much that fucks me up?

1:06:51.758 --> 1:06:57.845
Do you understand the self-loathing involved
when you, the station manager,

1:06:57.931 --> 1:07:01.719
comes in here to
tell me that you enjoy what I'm doing, hmm?

1:07:04.980 --> 1:07:06.311

Hey, do you know how sometimes

1:07:33.634 --> 1:07:36.341
you hear a song
that you've heard a million times before,

1:07:36.428 --> 1:07:39.636
and maybe you're even tired of hearing it?

1:07:40.807 --> 1:07:42.138
But this time,

1:07:44.519 --> 1:07:47.727
maybe because of something
you've been through,

1:07:47.814 --> 1:07:52.558
or maybe because of something
you now understand,

1:07:52.653 --> 1:07:54.644
you hear that song again.

1:07:56.156 --> 1:07:59.319
Maybe it's a new version, maybe not.

1:08:00.869 --> 1:08:05.363

there's a fresh world in there to be heard.
