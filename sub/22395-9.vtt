00:05.000 --> 00:08.125
There is no such thing as monsters!

00:08.125 --> 00:11.250
Oh, but there is! It's
down in the boiler room!

00:11.250 --> 00:12.917
It's absolutely real.

00:12.917 --> 00:14.667
I heard it ate
Ms. Johnson.

00:14.667 --> 00:16.750
I heard it is
Ms. Johnson.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.333
I heard that.

00:18.333 --> 00:21.542
Look, your building's water
heater has been broken for months.

00:21.542 --> 00:22.625
Without hot water,

00:22.625 --> 00:24.208
that guy can't shave,

00:24.208 --> 00:25.834
that guy can't shower,

00:25.834 --> 00:27.375
and I think that guy's dead.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.125
I just have dry skin.

00:29.125 --> 00:32.333
See? It needs fixin',
and I'm the fella to fix it.

00:32.333 --> 00:33.417
Oh, Mickey.

00:33.417 --> 00:35.083
You are so courageous.
Yipee!

00:35.083 --> 00:37.333
Well, I'll be back in a jiffy.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.166
Ha, ha.
Monster.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.959
Ah, swell.

00:48.500 --> 00:52.000
See? We understand
if you want to quit.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.792
Oh, no, no, no, no. I just,
uh, forgot some... tools.

00:56.792 --> 00:58.500
Yeah, oh, yeah, that's it, tools.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.041
Yeah, I just need, uh,
this... And, uh, this...

01:01.041 --> 01:03.083
...and these.
Oh.

01:03.083 --> 01:05.417
Really?
Now, if you'll excuse me...

01:05.417 --> 01:07.375
I have a boiler to fix!

01:21.083 --> 01:23.417
What... Hey, knock it off in there!

01:25.291 --> 01:27.041
Hmm?
Okay.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.709
Changed my mind...
Keep beating...

01:34.500 --> 01:36.667
Phew.

01:36.667 --> 01:38.000
Monster!

01:41.166 --> 01:42.417
Oh!
It got me!

01:44.709 --> 01:46.208
Monster.

01:46.208 --> 01:48.375
It's all in my head.

01:48.375 --> 01:51.041
All righty, then.
Off to fix that water...

02:01.792 --> 02:02.792
Whoa! Whoa!

02:03.083 --> 02:04.083
Ahh!

02:11.083 --> 02:12.458
Whoa!

02:12.458 --> 02:13.959
Oh! Oh! Oh!

02:16.709 --> 02:17.709
Huh?

02:21.333 --> 02:23.208
Huh? Hmm...

02:27.208 --> 02:28.417
Ow! Ow! Ow!

02:34.208 --> 02:35.792
Hmm...
Whoa!

02:41.458 --> 02:42.458
Ha!

02:51.083 --> 02:52.125
Oh, whoa...

02:57.542 --> 02:58.542
Nice!

02:59.125 --> 03:01.000
Oh?

03:03.041 --> 03:04.041
Ooh.

03:16.166 --> 03:18.417
Oh, Mickey, you're my hero!

03:18.417 --> 03:20.166
I told you I'd fix it.

03:20.166 --> 03:23.000
That's great, 'cause I have
something else that needs fixing.
