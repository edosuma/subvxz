00:51.818 --> 00:53.695
Great work on the Wharf project, Mary.

00:53.820 --> 00:56.426
The mayor said the restorations
make the whole city proud.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.538
Oh, well thank you Bob. Certainly
had the best team working with me.

00:59.593 --> 01:02.767
That you do, but your leadership's
what's holding it all together.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.604
I just want you to know I appreciate
all the hard work you're doing.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.043
No one in this company deserves
a week off more than you.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.581
Whoa! A week? You know I
can't stay away that long.

01:10.671 --> 01:13.117
No, I'm just going to the
mountains for the long weekend

01:13.206 --> 01:14.549
but I'll be back to work on Tuesday.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.450
Well, call if you
decide to take more time.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.353
We can't have your battery running
out when we're so close to completion.

01:19.446 --> 01:21.016
Okay, I will. Have a good one!

01:21.081 --> 01:21.786
Thanks.

01:24.117 --> 01:25.562
Hey!
- Hey!

01:25.619 --> 01:27.064
Need help organizing the files?

01:27.187 --> 01:28.860
All finished.
- They're all yours.

01:28.956 --> 01:33.928
Thanks. Will I be able to
reach you if anything comes up?

01:34.027 --> 01:36.906
Uh... when I'm at the lodge,
yes. When I'm hiking, no.

01:36.964 --> 01:41.208
So... do you think that
this is THE weekend'?

01:41.268 --> 01:42.406
The weekend?

01:45.405 --> 01:46.247
What?

01:46.373 --> 01:48.546
The weekend Kent pops the big question?

01:48.642 --> 01:52.590
Oh, I... I don't know. I mean
we've only been dating for what,

01:52.746 --> 01:53.622
a Year?

01:53.780 --> 01:57.227
Well I can just picture it. Him at the
top of a mountain, down on one knee.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.493
Wouldn't that be so romantic?

02:01.722 --> 02:05.226
It would be romantic. But
honestly, proposal or not,

02:05.325 --> 02:08.101
I am just looking forward to
getting to the great outdoors.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.440
Party pooper.

02:10.396 --> 02:12.434
You party your way, I'll party mine.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.777
Have fun with those!
- Will do.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.705
Good morning.
- Mary!

02:41.828 --> 02:43.501
How good to see you darling.

02:44.631 --> 02:46.611
I thought you and Kent
were in Silver Falls.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.839
Oh, I'm just on my way to pick him up.

02:48.935 --> 02:51.506
I'm amazed you can get that
boy outside the city limits.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.485
Dad! He's a lot more
rugged than you think.

02:56.209 --> 02:57.381
Where are the boys?

02:57.511 --> 02:59.457
They're working their own jobs,

02:59.513 --> 03:01.789
we see them every now and
then at the lumber yard.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.828
You know, I still think they
should be working for you.

03:03.950 --> 03:07.159
There's a reason it says
"and sons" on the truck.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.967
I mean, you taught them
everything they know.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.162
They have a right to try
to make it on their own.

03:12.292 --> 03:15.865
Heck, we didn't see you and your sister
half as much before your grandpa's surgery.

03:15.962 --> 03:18.033
Well' I mean, I have the Wharf project.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.735
We all have something.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.244
No, I just liked it when we
all spent more time together.

03:22.335 --> 03:24.815
Times change, you'll get used to it.

03:25.505 --> 03:26.643
I'm not sure I will.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.047
How's grandpa?

03:30.177 --> 03:31.850
He has his good days and his bad.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.654
More bad than good lately. Listen Mary,

03:35.482 --> 03:37.052
at some point we have to sit down

03:37.184 --> 03:38.595
and make some hard decisions.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.528
I don't want to talk
about it, all right?

03:43.857 --> 03:47.031
Kathy's up there now with him, I'm sure
they'll both be very happy to see you.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.933
All rig ht. Strong coffee!

03:56.169 --> 03:58.376
We can't keep pretending he's improving.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.116
She knows that in her head,

04:00.207 --> 04:02.380
it's just taking her heart
a little longer to catch up.

04:02.509 --> 04:05.683
Well, she'd better come around soon or
we'll have to make the decision without her.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.588
Well we can make that decision now.

04:09.349 --> 04:10.350
Well...

04:10.884 --> 04:14.457
Oh, I see. It's taking your heart a
little time to catch up too. Isn't it?

04:16.055 --> 04:17.194
He's my dad.

04:33.373 --> 04:34.283
Mary!

04:35.041 --> 04:39.649
Grandpa, relax. His blood pressure
always spikes when he sees you.

04:40.313 --> 04:41.383
Is that a bad thing?

04:41.481 --> 04:43.119
He'd be worse off if he didn't see you.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.993
We just all have to accept the fact
that you're the love of his life.

04:47.087 --> 04:51.467
Oh... so Grandpa, how you doing today?

04:52.592 --> 04:55.300
I'd be better if your sister
let me out of this room!

04:55.395 --> 04:59.138
Now Grandpa, you know I'm not
the one keeping you in here.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.246
Your doctor told you, you need to rest.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.974
It takes a little bit longer to recover
from heart surgery when you're 80.

05:04.070 --> 05:08.314
I'm as strong as an elk! Aren't I Mary?

05:08.408 --> 05:12.185
Oh, you're stronger but you still have
to listen to your doctor and Cathy.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.287
Are you headed to the mountains?

05:16.483 --> 05:17.257
Yeah.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.595
Do me a favor?
- Of course! Anything for you.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.998
Take me with you.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.630
Listen, once you get better we will
hike all over our favorite trails.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.933
Bring me back a couple
of pinecones, will you?

05:29.029 --> 05:31.270
The really big ones.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.969
Oh, you know I'm gonna have to try
to pick some up from the general store

05:34.100 --> 05:35.374
from the general store

05:35.502 --> 05:37.209
on the way out, because they don't
let you take them out of the park.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.782
And rightly so.

05:39.339 --> 05:43.651
Every generation should have the
privilege of experiencing the forest

05:43.810 --> 05:46.290
exactly as the good Lord meant it to be.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.790
Listen, when are you
gonna play for me again?

05:49.883 --> 05:54.229
When I get outta this room.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.298
Well...

05:55.388 --> 05:58.835
Kathy! You're gonna be late for
your shift, I'll take over now.

05:59.292 --> 06:00.896
Call me if you need me.
- Okay.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.199
Yeah I guess I should get going too.

06:04.331 --> 06:08.370
Say hello to your grandmother for me.

06:08.501 --> 06:09.536
Well you know what,

06:09.669 --> 06:12.013
you keep listening to Cathy and
you can say hello to her yourself.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.185
When will you be back?

06:19.246 --> 06:21.157
Monday night. I'll swing by, okay?

06:22.816 --> 06:24.420
I should really stay and help.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.895
I appreciate the offer, but you
need to take care of yourself.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.660
Thanks Morn.
- Bye bye.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.578
Have a good time.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.550
Leave everything we
talked about back here.

06:48.675 --> 06:49.585
Hey guys!

06:50.777 --> 06:52.779
Didn't expect to see you turncoats here.

06:53.613 --> 06:56.594
Me and Pete are workin' on the same
job, we needed to borrow some tools.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.264
Well, if you worked with
Dad like you're supposed to,

06:59.386 --> 07:00.888
you wouldn't have to borrow anything.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.898
I don't see you sitting
with him in that truck.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.400
I'm not a contractor anymore,

07:04.524 --> 07:06.731
and if I were, you'd better
believe that I'd be with him.

07:07.227 --> 07:10.572
I heard you and fancy pants
were going up the mountains.

07:11.464 --> 07:13.034
Think he's gonna give you a ring?

07:13.800 --> 07:15.575
Why is everyone trying to marry me off?

07:16.069 --> 07:17.810
Can't have a spinster in the family.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.585
Last time I checked you
weren't married Pete.

07:20.707 --> 07:24.154
Hey Dad, what's the male
equivalent of a spinster?

07:24.577 --> 07:25.578
Pete, I guess.

07:29.082 --> 07:29.958
Oh! See you guys.

07:42.329 --> 07:45.333
So, mega jazz festival in New York on
the fourth of July. We'll fly back there,

07:45.432 --> 07:48.345
We'll fly back there, we can
book a couple luxury hotel rooms,

07:48.435 --> 07:51.848
and then we'll hit the scene. You ever
been to Mama? Central Park, Little Italy,

07:51.938 --> 07:54.475
ooh Chinatown... man, I know
restaurants there even locals

07:54.574 --> 07:56.019
can't find with a GPS. We can... Mary?

07:56.142 --> 08:00.420
Mary? Hello! Mary, you're like
in your own little world there.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.458
Sorry Kent.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.528
So what do you say? You up for
a jazz fest in NYC on the fourth?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.659
Uh... I was actually hoping
we could get a couple tents

08:07.754 --> 08:09.461
and come out here for the weekend.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.100
You think you'll ever be able
to make time for the city?

08:13.593 --> 08:14.697
I live in the city!

08:14.794 --> 08:16.000
Yeah, but you don't like to go out.

08:16.663 --> 08:20.634
Well... you know, it's been a busy
year. Coming out here is the only thing

08:20.767 --> 08:22.974
between me and total exhaustion.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.515
Well, I feel the same
way about the city.

08:28.041 --> 08:28.985
Is it a rift?

08:30.043 --> 08:32.956
No, no of course not.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.247
Perfect.

09:00.740 --> 09:04.187
Here's the key to your room. Are
you ready to hit the first trail?

09:04.244 --> 09:06.190
Can't we just hang here
for the first day you know,

09:06.312 --> 09:07.757
limber up by the pool?

09:08.415 --> 09:10.224
Kent, we didn't come here to lounge.

09:10.316 --> 09:13.889
We can hereto get some
sunshine and fresh air. Right?

09:15.321 --> 09:15.992
Come on!

09:16.589 --> 09:17.260
Yes.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.190
I was thinking that we could
go to San Diego for Christmas.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.226
My cousin's got this
condo there that we could...

09:42.582 --> 09:46.052
Hey! Whoa, hold up. Can
we, can we take a break?

09:46.719 --> 09:48.699
Sorry Kent.

09:50.356 --> 09:51.926
Look at you, you're like uh...

09:52.959 --> 09:55.405
a mountain lion, you're
hardly breaking a sweat.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.636
Well, I've been coming
out here my whole life.

09:57.764 --> 10:01.576
It just take me a little longer to feel it.
- I don't get it.

10:02.268 --> 10:06.774
It's raining and you're loving it. What
is it about the mountains that grabs you?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.750
I don't know, you know I come out here and
it's like, every trouble just slips away.

10:11.144 --> 10:14.717
Every trouble just slips away. You
know. I never... I never feel more alive.

10:15.415 --> 10:20.160
It's not just that though, is
it? This place touches your soul.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.799
One time when I was a
little girl, my grandfather,

10:27.894 --> 10:30.272
he brought me to this beautiful
overlook on the trail up to the falls,

10:30.330 --> 10:34.472
and you could just like,
see for miles. And he said,

10:34.601 --> 10:38.310
"Mary, listen to me very
carefully. if you're ever troubled

10:38.438 --> 10:42.079
and you need to see God,
this is where you find him.

10:43.143 --> 10:47.751
His handy-work is visible on every...
every peak, every valley, every stream,

10:47.814 --> 10:50.192
every meadow, more than
anywhere else in the world."

10:51.351 --> 10:53.991
He said every minute spent out here is
a reminder... what a miracle life is.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.698
What a miracle life is.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.501
He said that he could feel God

11:01.594 --> 11:04.541
and my grandmother smiling
on him, every time we hiked.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.439
Can you feel them now?

11:10.937 --> 11:13.042
I've been talking to them
since we left the lodge.

11:13.439 --> 11:16.010
Well that explains why
I've been talking to myself.

11:18.444 --> 11:21.789
So, can they fix what's troubling you?

11:22.882 --> 11:27.058
No... but they're working on it.
My legs are itching to get hiking,

11:27.153 --> 11:29.827
you ready? Come on.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.693
I guess. But can we like,
slow it down a little?

11:32.825 --> 11:33.701
All right'

11:34.327 --> 11:35.362
It's not a race!

11:35.728 --> 11:37.901
Come on. Hup two!

11:38.898 --> 11:40.502
I think I wore the wrong shoes.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.172
You'll be fine.

11:49.175 --> 11:50.745
What's a dog doing down there?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.986
Help! Help me!

11:53.079 --> 11:54.683
There's your answer.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.192
Hello?

11:59.519 --> 12:02.557
Hi. What's your name?

12:02.989 --> 12:03.899
Charlene.

12:04.023 --> 12:06.094
Hey Charlene. Are, are you hurt?

12:06.526 --> 12:09.370
Yes! It's my ankle, I twisted it.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.768
Okay honey, just... just
sit tight, all right?

12:13.866 --> 12:14.776
Okay!

12:14.867 --> 12:16.869
Are we' are we gonna go for help?

12:16.936 --> 12:19.610
No, it's too late. There's you know,
there's bears and mountain lions out here.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.947
I'm pretty sure that I
can get her out of here.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.384
Pretty sure or certain?

12:24.744 --> 12:25.779
No, I can do it.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.791
Don't we need like
a... rope or something?

12:28.881 --> 12:32.852
No. I can't hike down
here but I can scramble.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.195
No, look... I'll, I'll go.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.464
No, hey Kent you know what?
It's, it's not the right time

12:38.558 --> 12:41.596
to learn how to scramble. Okay? Hey Charlene,
just hold on I'm coming down to get you!

12:42.262 --> 12:43.263
And Natty?

12:43.396 --> 12:44.966
Yeah! Of course.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.268
Look, if anything goes
wrong, just go back the way

12:48.401 --> 12:50.142
we came and grab help, okay?

12:50.236 --> 12:51.544
I don't feel good about this, Mary.

12:52.038 --> 12:55.713
Kent, I wouldn't do it if I thought
it was too dangerous. All right?

12:57.710 --> 12:59.087
Be careful.
- Okay.

13:02.048 --> 13:02.958
Watch it.

13:03.082 --> 13:04.152
Yeah, okay.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.725
Hang on Charlene! Okay!

13:19.565 --> 13:20.509
Got it.

13:24.570 --> 13:29.280
Hi! I'm Mary. I'm Mary Tobin.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.184
So how did you get down here?

13:31.811 --> 13:34.121
Well, Natty chased a
rabbit and got stuck.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.617
I came down to get him.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.625
Ifs okay Natty I needed a bath anyways.

13:41.988 --> 13:42.966
Natty!

13:43.323 --> 13:44.529
Where are your parents?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.295
I live with my dad over the ridge.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.036
He'd kill me if he knew
I was out here all alone.

13:50.129 --> 13:52.200
Yeah' he must be, he must be
worried sick about you, huh?

13:52.965 --> 13:55.343
He went into town to get some nails and
stuff, he's probably not even back yet.

13:55.468 --> 14:00.042
He's probably not even back yet.
You're not gonna tell on me, right?

14:00.473 --> 14:05.855
No, you know, that's uh...
that's up for you to tell him but,

14:05.978 --> 14:08.891
you just remember that the truth is
always a good place to begin, okay?

14:09.015 --> 14:11.052
Okay.
- Here, let me have a look at your ankle.

14:12.485 --> 14:16.956
Okay, okay. That's okay. All
right, you can't walk out of here.

14:17.056 --> 14:20.833
Do you think you've got enough strength
to climb onto me and I'll bring you up?

14:21.828 --> 14:22.636
Yeah.

14:23.363 --> 14:27.038
And Natty's gonna follow us,
all right? One, two, three!

14:27.700 --> 14:29.145
There you go. You're doing awesome!
- Okay.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.343
You're doing so good.
- Okay.

14:32.839 --> 14:36.844
I want you just to hang on to me.

14:36.976 --> 14:41.152
Okay, now three, two, one,
and just jump on. There you go.

14:41.647 --> 14:44.423
All right, Kent we're coming up!

14:45.651 --> 14:47.597
All right, you good?
- Yes.

14:47.687 --> 14:48.757
Okay, here we go.

14:50.757 --> 14:51.861
Natty come on!

14:56.229 --> 14:57.765
Okay. You okay?

14:58.698 --> 15:00.200
Yeah, how 'bout you?

15:01.334 --> 15:03.041
Gettin' dirtier by the inch!

15:04.604 --> 15:06.584
Okay, you're doing good.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.018
Nice and slow there Mar.

15:10.076 --> 15:10.918
Just hang on.

15:12.211 --> 15:15.681
All right, we're almost
there. All right, there we go.

15:15.782 --> 15:16.886
You okay?

15:17.016 --> 15:18.586
All right' three, two, one.

15:18.951 --> 15:20.555
There you go. Okay.

15:20.686 --> 15:22.688
You're doing good. Okay, one
more here. There you go, one more.

15:22.789 --> 15:23.767
Three, two!

15:23.890 --> 15:27.599
There. One more time. Three, two...! So!

15:27.727 --> 15:30.765
Give her to me, I got you, I got you!

15:31.898 --> 15:33.900
Charlene, this is my boyfriend Kent.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.141
Natty?

15:35.701 --> 15:37.146
We need to get her to a doctor.

15:37.236 --> 15:40.740
No, I think that uh... I think
we should get her home. Yeah?

15:40.873 --> 15:41.874
Well where's that?

15:41.974 --> 15:46.480
Just up over the ridge. You... do you
feel up to giving her a piggy-back?

15:46.612 --> 15:47.955
Yeah, sure uh...
- Okay.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.457
Okay. Okay, hang on a second.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.726
Okay, climb up.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.626
All right, you ready everybody?
There you go, there you go.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.425
You good?

15:54.487 --> 15:55.898
Yeah! You guys okay?

15:57.323 --> 15:58.825
Yeah.
- All right'

16:00.626 --> 16:01.764
Hang on.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.102
You okay?
- Yeah.

16:03.162 --> 16:04.163
Natty come here!

16:06.833 --> 16:07.971
Natty!

16:09.936 --> 16:10.676
All right'

16:12.004 --> 16:12.948
Hang on.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.786
Watch your head here.

16:22.114 --> 16:22.785
All right'

16:24.083 --> 16:25.153
Let's duck down.

16:25.284 --> 16:25.921
Okay.

16:28.921 --> 16:31.128
Oh wow, would you...would
you look at that?

16:31.691 --> 16:32.601
What?

16:33.526 --> 16:34.869
That's Christmas Lodge.

16:35.461 --> 16:36.701
What, that old wreck?

16:36.796 --> 16:38.969
Hey! That's not an old
wreck, that's my house!

16:39.031 --> 16:40.442
Sorry.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.312
You live at Christmas Lodge?

16:42.435 --> 16:43.175
Yup.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.308
Lucky you!

16:45.438 --> 16:46.849
What do you know about it?

16:47.807 --> 16:51.345
When I was little, this was
like our home away from home.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.722
Wait a second, is your dad Jack Rand?

16:54.847 --> 16:55.848
Well, yeah!

16:57.450 --> 16:59.862
I haven't seen him since
I was half your age.

16:59.986 --> 17:02.125
I can't wait to check out the lodge!

17:10.329 --> 17:11.364
Is that your dad?

17:11.497 --> 17:14.569
Yup. You promise you won't tell on me?

17:14.666 --> 17:16.237
No, I promise to let you tell.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.544
Charlene? You hurt?

17:24.175 --> 17:25.712
My ankle, I twisted it.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.557
Hi, who are you?

17:27.680 --> 17:30.593
Sorry. Uh, this is my friend
Kent and I'm Mary Tobin.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.560
We found Charlene and we thought
that we'd bring her back here.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.332
I was getting the mail.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.098
You were getting the mail?

17:41.594 --> 17:44.234
So you twisted your ankle
somewhere between here and the road'?

17:44.363 --> 17:45.933
Well...

17:46.065 --> 17:48.341
You didn't go hiking alone
in the park again, did you?

17:51.003 --> 17:52.004
Charlene?

17:53.005 --> 17:54.507
We will talk later.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.184
You said Mary Tobin?

17:59.412 --> 18:00.618
That name sounds awfully familiar.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.783
You're not Mike and Betty
Tobin's daughter, are you?

18:02.915 --> 18:04.019
One and the same!

18:04.116 --> 18:07.427
Good Lord! I haven't seen you
since, what, we were this high?

18:07.753 --> 18:09.198
How's your family doing?

18:09.255 --> 18:11.792
Oh, you know, they're
great! Mostly... yeah.

18:12.592 --> 18:16.199
Please, come inside! I'll
make you something to eat.

18:16.295 --> 18:17.899
We can, we can catch up.

18:18.030 --> 18:20.032
Food, yes! Now we're talking.

18:20.132 --> 18:21.634
Please, um... come inside.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.541
Come on Natty!

18:30.876 --> 18:31.752
I'm hungry.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.393
Well, welcome back to Christmas Lodge.

18:41.887 --> 18:44.299
It's probably not exactly
how you remember it, is it?

18:47.960 --> 18:50.497
Not exactly, but I can
picture it the way it was

18:50.663 --> 18:51.903
when I was a kid.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.068
How was it?

18:54.900 --> 18:55.844
Magical.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.073
Magical! This place...

19:00.239 --> 19:03.584
Please, you guys just make yourselves
at home while I tend to Charlene.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.088
Daddy, it really hurts.
- I know, sweetheart.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.921
I just gotta get it elevated
until I can get some ice on it.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.627
Oww, Daddy.

19:24.196 --> 19:26.107
This place has a rare charm.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.606
It takes a special eye to see it.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.147
Yeah, you can say that again.

19:31.637 --> 19:32.615
Cut it out!

19:32.672 --> 19:33.810
Just joking.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.456
Jackson F. Huntington, right?
- Yeah, how did you know that?

19:42.548 --> 19:43.959
I'm a historic preservationist.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.724
I mean, I work in the city but
lire read up on all his lodges.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.460
The way that the
exposed beams are fixed,

19:49.555 --> 19:51.364
it has Huntington written all over it.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.298
What does that mean?

19:54.493 --> 19:56.734
It's like the lodge is a living
thing, you know, the structures,

19:56.862 --> 19:58.842
they use gravity to support itself.

19:59.498 --> 20:01.478
I bet not a single nail up there, right?

20:01.534 --> 20:05.346
I am impressed! Yup, Huntington
drew up the plans in uh...

20:06.472 --> 20:08.509
my great grandfather
built it in the 1920's.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.144
How long did you and your
uh, family come up here for?

20:11.744 --> 20:14.850
Up until I was probably 5 or 6.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.689
My grandpa and my grandma,

20:16.816 --> 20:18.762
they used to bring the whole
family up here for Christmas.

20:19.885 --> 20:24.595
And then after she died, well grandpa,
he couldn't bear to come up here

20:24.690 --> 20:27.364
so we stayed at the lodge
in the national park.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.737
To keep grandpa from
getting upset we just,

20:30.863 --> 20:33.776
we just stopped talking about it.

20:35.401 --> 20:38.382
You know, I always wondered
what happened to Christmas Lodge.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.518
Well I'm glad you found us again.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.718
Why don't you guys just
make yourselves at home

20:44.777 --> 20:46.450
and I'll uh, get us something to eat.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.391
Jack, that meal was excellent.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.903
So good! Who taught you how to cook?

21:03.129 --> 21:06.872
Three generations of my family.
Heck a couple dozen guests

21:06.932 --> 21:09.776
taught me a trick or two. See we uh,

21:09.869 --> 21:12.213
I didn't know how to do
everything around here

21:12.271 --> 21:13.875
just to keep this old girl up and
running. I have a little something

21:13.939 --> 21:19.582
I think you're gonna
want to take a look at.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.089
Thanks.

21:24.383 --> 21:25.794
Oh, wow!

21:29.088 --> 21:30.396
Who are all these people?

21:30.489 --> 21:33.936
Those are our guests. See
my great grandparents started

21:33.993 --> 21:37.065
this tradition of taking holiday photos
of every family whoever stayed here.

21:37.930 --> 21:41.241
And uh, when Charlene and I finally
get this place up and running,

21:41.333 --> 21:42.835
we're gonna start another album.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.010
Ahh! Oh wow.
- What?

21:49.108 --> 21:51.019
That's... that's us.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.646
What? Which one's you?

21:52.745 --> 21:54.315
Are you kidding me? Right there!

21:54.446 --> 21:56.483
Oh! Nice snorkel jacket.

21:58.517 --> 22:01.521
Jack, these photos are priceless!

22:01.654 --> 22:04.464
So when do you think that the
uh, renovation will be complete?

22:04.857 --> 22:08.498
Oh, you know that is a
question I've been asking

22:08.627 --> 22:10.834
for years now.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.943
What uh, what's set you back'?

22:13.799 --> 22:17.508
Well my mom and dad
they had an accident.

22:18.470 --> 22:23.044
A logging truck hit a patch of black
ice and crossed over the centre line.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.856
So Charlene and I, we uh,
rented a place in the city

22:26.946 --> 22:30.018
near the hospitals, hoping
they would get better.

22:30.115 --> 22:32.823
But uh, sometimes the
Lord has other plans.

22:34.153 --> 22:37.464
Anyway, when we were gone,
nature kind of took over up here.

22:37.556 --> 22:42.835
Well, we've been struggling
to catch up ever since.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.805
Jack, I'm so sorry to hear that.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.073
It's all right.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.573
I mean, don't you have
somebody helping you?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.841
No, supplies are kind of expensive and
I can't afford to hire any extra help.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.349
To hire any extra help.

22:54.673 --> 22:58.052
More hands is the only way we're
gonna get ahead of nature up here.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.521
Well, have you thought
of applying for funding

23:00.646 --> 23:02.216
to help cover the expenses?

23:03.148 --> 23:04.149
Apply to who?

23:05.384 --> 23:09.025
Your lodge with its long and
illustrious history, I mean.

23:09.154 --> 23:11.430
I'm sure ifs eligible
for private grant money

23:11.590 --> 23:13.592
you could use to hire contractors.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.865
I don't know about that.

23:16.762 --> 23:18.241
Are you willing to try?

23:20.699 --> 23:26.377
Christmas Lodge is my life.
I'll do anything to save her.

23:26.839 --> 23:30.412
Great! Well I'll... I'll
research some suitable programs

23:30.542 --> 23:32.579
when I get back to the city
and I'll give you a call.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.079
Thank you.

23:34.213 --> 23:37.456
Well that was some meal but I am beat,

23:37.549 --> 23:39.119
I guess it's time we
should be heading back.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.252
Yeah' I'll give you a lift.

23:40.386 --> 23:43.128
Count me in, my dogs are
howlin' from that hike!

23:43.455 --> 23:45.401
Your dogs?
- They say that.

23:45.457 --> 23:47.698
No they don't.
- It was along hike.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.138
Back in a little bit honey.
- Take care Charlene!

23:51.563 --> 23:52.940
Bye!
- Bye!

24:00.572 --> 24:03.610
All right, hey! Nice, I've got a signal.

24:09.214 --> 24:10.750
Well, thank you for everything Jack.

24:11.150 --> 24:14.290
Oh please, it's the least I could
do after you helped Charlene.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.930
You're not going to be
too hard on her are you?

24:16.989 --> 24:19.265
No, no she's a good kid.

24:19.758 --> 24:22.796
I know it can't be easy living up there
with just me and Natty to play with.

24:23.629 --> 24:24.733
Anyways,

24:24.830 --> 24:27.674
I'll be in touch with you next week!

24:27.766 --> 24:30.838
Okay. Oh, wait, wait, wait
I've got something for you.

24:37.142 --> 24:43.115
Oh! Oh, Jack! I can't take these,

24:43.248 --> 24:46.422
these, they belong to Christmas
Lodge. This is a part of your heritage.

24:46.518 --> 24:48.759
No that is a part of our heritage.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.764
See, my great grandparents
always said that anyone

24:50.856 --> 24:53.132
who stays at the lodge
is family for life.

24:53.258 --> 24:55.295
Sounds creepy, but it's not.

24:57.129 --> 24:58.506
You know what, I'm
gonna have copies made

24:58.630 --> 24:59.836
and I'll bring you back the originals.

24:59.965 --> 25:02.844
Okay. I will look forward
to seeing you again.

25:03.836 --> 25:08.615
I'll look forward to seeing you
too and Charlene, and the lodge.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.617
I hope I can help you
get it back on track.

25:11.677 --> 25:12.485
Thank you.

25:13.379 --> 25:14.153
Okay.

25:18.217 --> 25:18.957
Take care!

25:23.889 --> 25:24.799
You all set?

25:26.358 --> 25:28.360
So do you really think you can help him

25:28.460 --> 25:30.371
bring that old heap back from the brink?

25:31.063 --> 25:34.169
Well, I'm sure gonna try. You
know, my grandfather, he taught me

25:34.299 --> 25:38.839
not to turn your back on your own
history. And Christmas Lodge is a valuable

25:38.971 --> 25:42.077
part of my past, and I owe it to
my family to make sure it's around

25:42.174 --> 25:44.245
for generations to come.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.990
Well, it's a noble mission.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.025
And a labor of love.

25:49.648 --> 25:52.993
Because I've always wanted
to work on an old lodge.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.087
Yeah?

26:07.833 --> 26:09.506
Yeah. Oh, hey Dad!

26:10.235 --> 26:11.373
How was your trip?

26:11.503 --> 26:12.846
The best.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.544
Kent propose?

26:16.108 --> 26:17.781
Would you be happy if he did?

26:19.778 --> 26:21.223
Yeah, that's what I thought.

26:22.081 --> 26:25.893
I don't dislike the boy, Mary.
He's just a little too city for me.

26:25.951 --> 26:28.295
Well, don't worry about it,
you won't have to live with him.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.233
Here, look at this.

26:36.195 --> 26:40.541
Christmas Lodge? I haven't
thought about this place in years.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.135
Where'd you find this?

26:42.301 --> 26:44.645
Well, Kent and I, we
rescued Jack Rand's daughter

26:44.770 --> 26:46.807
and brought her back to
the lodge, and Jack...

26:46.939 --> 26:49.442
he was, he was nice
enough to pass these along.

26:49.575 --> 26:53.216
Jack Rand...you mean little Jackie?

26:53.312 --> 26:55.918
Yeah, well little Jackie,
he's not so little anymore.

26:56.548 --> 26:57.754
He's bigger than Pete.

26:57.883 --> 27:00.955
He was a good kid, always helping
his parents around the place.

27:01.553 --> 27:02.463
How are they?

27:03.255 --> 27:07.328
They died because of a car
accident a few years ago.

27:07.493 --> 27:13.466
Oh no- Oh, I'm sorry to hear
that. They were good people,

27:13.966 --> 27:17.243
fine people. Jack doing a good business?

27:17.336 --> 27:20.647
Actually, no... and
that's where you come in.

27:20.739 --> 27:21.649
Me?

27:21.740 --> 27:25.984
Yes, you. You see, the lodge it...
it went into disrepair when Jack

27:26.111 --> 27:28.455
was in the city taking
care of his parents.

27:28.580 --> 27:31.618
I mean, he's trying hard to
get it back on track but...

27:31.750 --> 27:34.492
it's pretty obvious that
the elements are winning.

27:34.586 --> 27:38.432
So, I told him I would see if
there's grant money available

27:38.524 --> 27:41.596
to help him, but in the meantime,

27:41.693 --> 27:43.536
I want you and the boys to
inspect the lodge top to bottom

27:43.662 --> 27:46.006
and get an estimate of how
much it would cost to renovate.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.980
I can tell you right
now, a lodge this size...

27:50.102 --> 27:52.605
half a million dollars
wouldn't even cover the kitchen.

27:52.771 --> 27:53.977
Seriously?

27:54.139 --> 27:56.312
You coordinate restoration projects.

27:56.441 --> 28:00.947
You know as well as I do, an old
building can easily become a money pit.

28:01.046 --> 28:02.787
No, Dad I'm used to dealing
with old city structures

28:02.881 --> 28:05.020
that are very complex.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.063
I mean, I didn't think that
a lodge would cost that much!

28:07.186 --> 28:11.532
Well, it might cost more, I'm sure
the roof, the windows, electrical,

28:11.657 --> 28:13.500
plumbing systems are
due for an overhaul.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.364
We're talking big money,
kiddo. Big, big money.

28:16.495 --> 28:17.906
So what should I do?

28:19.131 --> 28:21.543
Keep the memories and let the lodge go.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.670
That's not what Grandpa would say.

28:23.802 --> 28:26.908
No, and sentimental projects like that
one cost him a lot of time and money

28:27.005 --> 28:29.076
and money and still didn't
make it to completion.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.221
You're taking this awful personally.

28:36.048 --> 28:40.497
You know, I just...l thought it'd
be nice to get the whole family,

28:40.552 --> 28:46.093
even Grandpa, back up there for
another old-fashioned family Christmas.

28:47.492 --> 28:51.269
I thought it would
bring us closer together.

28:52.197 --> 28:58.842
Look at this photo we seemed so happy.

28:58.937 --> 29:00.848
We were Mary, we were.

29:01.273 --> 29:05.380
No denying it, just... time marches on.

29:06.178 --> 29:06.918
Yeah.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.058
Where's Mom?
- Upstairs, tending Grandpa.

29:21.260 --> 29:25.106
My body to be burned, and have not
charity. It profiteth me nothing.

29:27.199 --> 29:28.234
Come in!

29:28.400 --> 29:29.310
Hi.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.540
You said you'd come! Here you are.

29:32.638 --> 29:34.140
How was Silver Falls?

29:34.273 --> 29:39.450
Oh, it was wonderful.
And I brought you this!

29:44.383 --> 29:46.488
It's like being there.

29:48.153 --> 29:51.566
Did you go to all our favorite places?

29:51.623 --> 29:55.298
Yup! And I have something to show you.

29:56.094 --> 29:57.334
If you can get his glasses.

30:07.239 --> 30:11.415
Christmas Lodge! I remember
it like it was yesterday.

30:11.810 --> 30:12.515
Yeah!

30:12.678 --> 30:17.354
I remember it like it was yesterday.

30:18.850 --> 30:20.659
Look at your grandmother,

30:22.454 --> 30:25.435
she's as pretty as
the day I married her.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.134
I miss her.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.644
Did you tell her I said hello?

30:34.766 --> 30:35.642
Of course.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.339
And what did she say?

30:38.103 --> 30:41.209
Well, she said to give you
that photo as a reminder

30:41.340 --> 30:43.377
of how much she loves you.

30:44.309 --> 30:45.515
Where did you get that?

30:45.644 --> 30:49.524
We were hiking, Kent and I, and
we just stumbled onto the lodge.

30:49.648 --> 30:55.189
You didn't stumble on anything!
Mavis wanted you to go there.

30:57.322 --> 30:59.962
She's strong willed you know.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.965
She sent you there for a reason.

31:05.964 --> 31:07.238
What reason Grandpa?

31:08.333 --> 31:09.573
Time will tell.

31:12.637 --> 31:13.547
Betty.

31:13.672 --> 31:17.415
Could you get that box
from out of that basket?

31:23.648 --> 31:25.491
Oh, this is beautiful.

31:25.650 --> 31:28.187
I made it myself.

31:29.221 --> 31:32.896
The timber comes from a
beam I replaced at the lodge.

31:33.024 --> 31:34.162
Can I open it?

31:42.901 --> 31:46.371
Wow. Grandpa these photos are priceless,
how come you haven't shown them to me before?

31:46.538 --> 31:47.915
Who's that right there?

31:53.678 --> 31:55.589
That's me and your grandmother!

31:55.714 --> 31:57.751
You knew Grandma when you were kids?

31:57.849 --> 31:59.954
I met her and her family at the lodge.

32:00.285 --> 32:01.525
Really?

32:01.620 --> 32:08.697
Our families became fast friends.
I knew she was gonna be my girl

32:08.794 --> 32:12.139
the first time I laid eyes on her.

32:12.230 --> 32:13.641
She's so beautiful.

32:13.765 --> 32:18.373
That's an understatement.
Beauty's only half the story.

32:20.305 --> 32:27.052
No one could sled, or
skate or make a snowman

32:27.145 --> 32:28.886
like your grandmother.

32:28.980 --> 32:38.458
And in the summer, she could climb the
steepest rock-face like a mountain goat.

32:39.391 --> 32:43.396
And she stared down all manner
of mountain lions and bears

32:43.495 --> 32:48.740
until they ran off
crying like little babies.

32:51.736 --> 32:55.946
You remind me of her, always have.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.988
Nothing stops either of you.

33:10.021 --> 33:12.433
What is this one right here?

33:15.160 --> 33:21.941
The Rands let me and
Mavis run the kitchen,

33:22.200 --> 33:24.874
Really?
- And we had a fine time of it.

33:26.304 --> 33:30.775
At Christmas time, we
made the biggest feast

33:30.876 --> 33:33.288
this side of Kansas City.

33:35.113 --> 33:38.822
Oh, Mavis knew exactly what to do.

33:40.318 --> 33:42.855
I was her apprentice.

33:44.789 --> 33:49.670
We worked like clockwork together and...

33:51.796 --> 33:54.504
That time you and Grandma
took Cathy and I to the picnic,

33:54.633 --> 33:55.907
I was such a brat!

33:58.870 --> 34:02.818
Betty? When did you leave?
- 1963.

34:05.010 --> 34:06.387
Mary, it's getting late.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.389
Yeah. Okay Grandpa.

34:09.981 --> 34:14.259
Thank you for reminding
me how joyous life can be.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.831
The life that you have led
at Christmas Lodge, I...

34:17.389 --> 34:20.768
What I wouldn't give for
another Christmas up there.

34:24.029 --> 34:27.533
I'll be here any time
you want to open this box

34:27.666 --> 34:29.168
and go back with me.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.235
Promise?
- Promise.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.110
Love you Grandpa.

34:37.042 --> 34:38.350
Love you too kid.

34:44.683 --> 34:49.029
Hey! You look like a woman on a mission.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.259
I am. Listen, what are
you doing this weekend?

34:51.389 --> 34:55.632
Oh, the usual glamour stuff, cleaning
gutters and mulching trees. Why?

34:55.726 --> 34:58.105
What do you say about
a trip to the mountains?

34:58.229 --> 35:02.075
Oh, no, no- I thought we settled
this Christmas Lodge issue.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.237
Okay, we did. But Grandpa,
he just set me straight.

35:04.369 --> 35:07.282
I'm not just gonna sit
around and watch it collapse.

35:07.405 --> 35:09.442
There's too much of us in it,

35:09.574 --> 35:11.451
and Jack...he deserves to
continue his family's legacy.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.714
What about the cost?

35:12.777 --> 35:14.779
Don't worry about the cost,
I will take care of the cost.

35:14.879 --> 35:16.483
You just tell the boys
that we are going on a trip.

35:16.581 --> 35:18.060
Oh, and if they don't wanna go?

35:18.149 --> 35:22.427
Well then you remind them that you're
their father, and their boss. Okay?

35:25.056 --> 35:25.796
Good night.

35:31.262 --> 35:33.640
I do not know how you
manage all those people.

35:33.732 --> 35:36.906
The carpenters, the plumbers, the
electricians, the drywall crew,

35:36.968 --> 35:41.940
the city inspectors. The phone
rang' and rang, and rang, and rang!

35:42.007 --> 35:45.318
Good morning! But you
kept it all in order?

35:45.410 --> 35:48.152
Well, of course. But I didn't like it.

35:48.279 --> 35:49.656
It gets easier with practice.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.193
So, where is it?

35:51.316 --> 35:53.694
Oh, no... Kent did not propose.

35:54.185 --> 35:56.461
You mean I did all that
filling in for you for nothing?

35:56.588 --> 36:01.162
No! The trip, it was
fulfilling in an unexpected way.

36:02.193 --> 36:04.002
Oh, Bob! Hi.

36:04.162 --> 36:07.166
Yolanda! You did a great
job covering for Mary.

36:07.332 --> 36:09.676
Everyone down at the Wharf
said you gave them everything

36:09.768 --> 36:11.304
they needed to get their job done.

36:11.436 --> 36:12.881
All I heard was grumbling.

36:12.971 --> 36:15.884
That means they like you!
Keep up the good work.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.946
Will do. I'll talk lo you later.

36:19.110 --> 36:19.815
Yeah.

36:21.646 --> 36:23.148
Did you recharge your batteries?

36:23.281 --> 36:25.386
Oh, the mountains, they
always deliver. Listen Bob,

36:25.517 --> 36:28.191
what do you know about grants
for renovating old lodges?

36:28.319 --> 36:30.890
All my work's been in the
city but I would imagine

36:30.989 --> 36:33.026
the basics are the same. Why?

36:43.034 --> 36:44.479
Dad, can you get the phone?

36:45.737 --> 36:48.183
I got it! It's been so long
since we got a call I thought

36:48.640 --> 36:50.586
the phone was broken.
Hello! Christmas Lodge.

36:51.209 --> 36:55.157
Jack! Hi, it's Mary. Mary Tobin.

36:55.580 --> 36:57.150
Hello Mary Tobin.

36:57.215 --> 37:00.389
Hey! Uh... listen, how's Charlene?

37:02.153 --> 37:05.532
Uh... she's a trooper, she's um,
helping me fix a window as we speak.

37:06.925 --> 37:10.270
Wow! She'll be a master
contractor one day.

37:10.361 --> 37:12.898
Listen, I'm calling with good news.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.237
Good news.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.873
Wow' I haven't heard those two
words strung together in a long time.

37:18.002 --> 37:20.915
Well, get ready. I told
my boss about the lodge,

37:21.039 --> 37:24.282
and he is gonna ask the board
for a grant to reopen it.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.082
And that's not all, my...

37:26.211 --> 37:29.522
my father and my brothers,
they're licensed contractors

37:29.581 --> 37:31.857
and they'd love to come by and take a
look at the lodge, and get an estimate

37:31.950 --> 37:37.457
for the cost of your grant
application. So what do you think?

37:38.089 --> 37:40.899
I... I don't know what to think.

37:41.693 --> 37:45.641
Oh, you know... um, I didn't
mean to create a problem for you.

37:45.764 --> 37:53.046
No, it's not a problem it's just that...well,
it's just that um, me and my family have always

37:53.104 --> 37:58.782
looked after the lodge ourselves.
It's uh, it's a pretty big step for me.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.083
Of course, I completely understand

38:01.212 --> 38:03.123
and I want you to know that
we're here to advise you,

38:03.248 --> 38:05.091
not to take over.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.754
Nothing will be done
without your permission.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.156
Thank you Mary.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.825
Great! Um... I'll see you, Saturday?

38:12.924 --> 38:14.130
Saturday it is.

38:14.259 --> 38:15.636
Take care.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.241
What did Mary say?

38:25.436 --> 38:28.974
Uh, she said that she's
gonna come up with her family

38:29.107 --> 38:31.587
and help fix up the lodge.

38:31.676 --> 38:35.317
Really? You know, Grandma always said

38:35.446 --> 38:40.259
that the Lord was looking out for
Christmas Lodge. You think she sent them?

38:40.752 --> 38:45.167
Maybe. Maybe Charlene.

38:47.158 --> 38:50.196
So um, how did, how did
Jack respond to your plan?

38:50.328 --> 38:52.535
Well, mountain men,
they're pretty stubborn

38:52.630 --> 38:55.702
but they are practical to
a fault, so he said yes!

38:57.702 --> 38:59.841
So' when do you go back up there?

39:00.138 --> 39:03.517
First thing tomorrow morning. You
know what, why don't you come along?

39:08.112 --> 39:08.886
Kent.

39:10.515 --> 39:13.860
Look Mary, you remember when I told you

39:13.985 --> 39:16.488
it wasn't a rift? You like
the mountains and I like city?

39:17.488 --> 39:18.626
Yeah.

39:20.058 --> 39:23.665
I think I was wrong. I
can't go on pretending

39:23.795 --> 39:25.866
I'm not cut out for that lifestyle.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.034
I like to be in the middle of things

39:28.166 --> 39:30.077
and you're happier as far
away from here as you can get.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.306
And I don't think either one
of us should go on pretending.

39:36.307 --> 39:37.843
Are you breaking up with me?

39:37.976 --> 39:45.656
Oh, wow. I'm afraid so. Look,
I'd still like to be friends,

39:45.750 --> 39:47.525
when you come back to the city.

39:47.585 --> 39:52.034
You know what, okay... I'll um, I'll
try to spend some more time here and...

39:53.191 --> 39:57.435
You'd, you'd be miserable and... I just
don't think that's good for either of us.

39:59.597 --> 40:00.598
I should go.

40:01.266 --> 40:03.872
Isn't there any way
we could work this out?

40:04.903 --> 40:07.076
We're just... we're on
different trails, Mary.

40:07.906 --> 40:11.752
Different trails that don't
go to the same destination.

40:14.445 --> 40:15.389
But...

40:15.513 --> 40:16.457
I'm, I'm sorry.

40:26.057 --> 40:31.063
Because you're a smart, intelligent,
beautiful, adventurous woman

40:31.229 --> 40:33.402
and you won't settle
for less in a partner.

40:33.531 --> 40:38.207
Mom, Kent... he was, he was
smart, and he was handsome...

40:39.604 --> 40:41.379
But he wasn't adventurous.

40:42.573 --> 40:47.079
It took a lot of strength for
him to recognize the truth,

40:47.145 --> 40:50.126
that you were holding each other back
from the life you were meant to lead.

40:51.716 --> 40:55.095
But, Mom... I would... I
would've changed for him.

40:55.219 --> 40:56.960
You know that pretending
to be something you're not

40:57.088 --> 40:58.795
wouldn't be good for either of you.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.440
So what do I do now?

41:04.963 --> 41:08.342
Be truthful. Be truthful to
yourself and to the world,

41:08.433 --> 41:10.970
and you'll find the
man who's right for you.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.608
Okay' what if he doesn't show up?

41:13.738 --> 41:16.651
Mom, cuz I'm really
tired of living alone.

41:17.275 --> 41:21.087
Have faith! Have faith Mary,
and the Lord will provide.

41:25.750 --> 41:27.457
Hey' is that Mary?

41:28.252 --> 41:29.629
Go see for yourself.

41:37.295 --> 41:39.002
And she brought the army.

41:39.597 --> 41:42.476
Whoa, this takes me back.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.443
You still remember coming here?

41:44.502 --> 41:46.812
I can already see the lodge
is gonna need a lot of work

41:46.871 --> 41:50.614
to bring it back to the way
I remember it. A lot of work.

41:50.675 --> 41:52.780
Well, that's why we're here.

41:57.281 --> 41:59.124
Mary! Mary!

41:59.650 --> 42:02.290
Whoa, you are a fast healer!

42:02.387 --> 42:04.560
Yeah, nothing that a little
Epsom salt couldn't fix.

42:04.655 --> 42:08.330
That's what Dad always said.
He'd use it on a cracked skull.

42:08.793 --> 42:12.468
It's true! Uh, Jack Rand, you
remember my dad Mike Tobin.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.066
And this is Charlene.

42:14.198 --> 42:16.075
Hi. Little Jackie.

42:16.167 --> 42:18.807
Oh, I haven't been
called that in years sir.

42:18.870 --> 42:22.511
It's a compliment! I remember
you as a kid, lugging suitcases

42:22.640 --> 42:24.847
twice your size up those steps

42:24.909 --> 42:27.355
without breaking a sweat. Big
Jackie used to say there wasn't a man

42:27.478 --> 42:29.651
in these mountains that
couldn't out-haul your dad.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.887
I think he just said
that to keep me moving.

42:33.184 --> 42:35.391
Jack this is my brother Matthew.
- Hi.

42:35.853 --> 42:38.424
And Charlene, Matthew. And
this is my other brother Pete.

42:38.523 --> 42:41.561
Thanks for coming up
here. Well, here she is.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.769
I was gonna fix her up myself but
uh, last couple of years the blizzards

42:45.897 --> 42:48.707
have been pretty hard on her,
not even close to catching up.

42:48.766 --> 42:51.542
Can't be all that
bad, let's take a look.

43:27.805 --> 43:30.581
Okay, well we have good news
Matthew, the gutters are okay.

43:30.708 --> 43:32.415
Okay.
- How do the windows look?

43:32.477 --> 43:34.150
Uh... this one's gotta go too.

43:35.046 --> 43:35.990
Okay.

44:05.676 --> 44:11.285
Oh my goodness. This
place is a time machine.

44:12.517 --> 44:16.158
I can still see the family
sitting at this table,

44:16.754 --> 44:20.861
with Grandpa here at the
head, Grandma at the other end

44:20.958 --> 44:23.871
and you kids, as little as
chipmunks sitting in the middle.

44:24.762 --> 44:26.105
Biggest chipmunk.

44:26.164 --> 44:28.110
And Jack, man could your family cook.

44:28.166 --> 44:31.272
And Jack is continuing on the tradition!

44:31.335 --> 44:33.042
Uh, yeah... I'll never be quite as
good as my grandmother was but uh,

44:33.137 --> 44:35.515
I will put my best in the dinner.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.881
Oh, no don't go to any bother, son.

44:38.009 --> 44:39.818
Mother packed provisions in the cooler.

44:40.311 --> 44:43.053
Well I appreciate that sir, but
you've gotta let me make one meal,

44:43.147 --> 44:44.854
that's the least I could do.

44:45.349 --> 44:47.693
Do you know how to make
those sourdough biscuits

44:47.818 --> 44:49.320
that your grandmother used to make?

44:49.453 --> 44:52.024
You know, I might just
happen to have a batch ready

44:52.123 --> 44:53.500
to go in the oven as we speak.

44:54.458 --> 44:57.064
Well then, I think we might
have time for a bite or two!

44:57.562 --> 44:59.564
I still remember these biscuits.

44:59.697 --> 45:02.075
They tasted like... Christmas.

45:03.134 --> 45:04.306
What does that mean?

45:04.368 --> 45:07.247
Pete my boy, there are some
things that can't be explained.

45:07.371 --> 45:09.009
You just have to taste
them for yourself.

45:32.763 --> 45:33.741
Who's that?

45:34.532 --> 45:35.840
That's my grandpa.

45:36.500 --> 45:38.104
So, is that your grandma?

45:38.769 --> 45:40.248
She's in heaven, right?

45:40.438 --> 45:41.610
Yeah, she is.

45:44.041 --> 45:46.282
Can you bring your
grandpa next time you come?

45:47.278 --> 45:48.518
You wanna see him?

45:48.879 --> 45:53.692
Well, ifs just that-.-
I miss my grandpa.

45:53.751 --> 45:54.957
Yeah.

45:56.687 --> 45:57.563
I'll tell you what,

45:57.622 --> 45:58.896
I'll see what I can do.

45:59.457 --> 46:01.198
Mary.
- Yeah'?

46:01.259 --> 46:04.138
Can I speak to you?
- Sure. I'll be back.

46:10.201 --> 46:11.111
What's up?

46:12.970 --> 46:16.474
You know, ifs not fair to
that little girl to promise

46:16.607 --> 46:18.484
her something that
isn't going to happen.

46:18.609 --> 46:21.112
Dad, how do you know it isn't?

46:21.212 --> 46:23.453
My father is a very sick man.

46:24.081 --> 46:27.255
Grandpa, he's the strongest
man alive. He'll rally.

46:27.918 --> 46:29.920
That's about as likely as
this lodge fixing itself.

46:29.987 --> 46:32.900
Time takes it's toll Mary,

46:33.057 --> 46:34.730
we have to learn to accept it.

46:34.825 --> 46:37.271
You know, Grandpa,
he taught me to fight,

46:37.395 --> 46:38.931
and I'm not giving up on him.

46:38.996 --> 46:40.441
I'm not giving up either,

46:40.564 --> 46:42.771
I'm just trying to get you
to accept the inevitable.

46:42.900 --> 46:45.346
No, Dad. I don't wanna talk about it.

46:46.237 --> 46:50.151
That's okay. Just promise me

46:50.274 --> 46:52.276
you won't get that
little girl's hopes up.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.520
I promise.

47:02.153 --> 47:05.999
Dinner is served.
- Wow, here... can I help you?

47:06.090 --> 47:07.125
Yeah.

47:08.125 --> 47:10.298
Before we begin sir, I'd be honored

47:10.361 --> 47:12.102
if you would lead us in Grace.

47:15.633 --> 47:20.878
Dear Lord, we thank you for the
blessing of your divine love,

47:21.005 --> 47:23.713
and the love of family and friends.

47:24.842 --> 47:28.449
And we thank you for the blessing
of this visit to Christmas Lodge.

47:28.512 --> 47:32.619
May it be a place that always
feels like home to all of us. Amen.

47:33.351 --> 47:34.227
Amen.

47:34.819 --> 47:35.854
Amen.

47:35.986 --> 47:39.126
Now, pass the biscuits boy
and take one for yourself.

47:39.223 --> 47:40.896
Don't be shy, dig in!

47:40.991 --> 47:42.629
Thanks Dad.

47:43.894 --> 47:45.498
Am I right?

47:45.996 --> 47:48.237
Yeah, like Christmas!

47:49.233 --> 47:50.576
What's your secret ingredient?

47:51.635 --> 47:53.546
To be honest, we've
never been quite sure.

47:53.671 --> 47:56.743
It's either the um... pure
mountain water or the uh,

47:57.742 --> 48:02.316
very well seasoned stove that's been baking
them just right for a very, very long time.

48:02.913 --> 48:05.325
Take that old stove off
the replacement list!

48:06.150 --> 48:09.359
I don't know, I don't think it
has anything to do with the water,

48:09.420 --> 48:14.927
or the stove, I... I think that Christmas
Lodge has a heart of ifs own heart

48:15.059 --> 48:17.505
and it just wants people to be happy.

48:18.362 --> 48:19.568
I like that.

48:20.664 --> 48:21.540
Me too.

48:25.269 --> 48:26.111
Thank you.

48:30.040 --> 48:32.611
I still can't believe
you're doing all this for us.

48:33.444 --> 48:36.448
Well, my grandparents
and my parents taught us

48:36.580 --> 48:38.355
that you don't turn your
back on people that need help.

48:38.449 --> 48:40.895
And I'm sure that your
folks taught you the same.

48:41.018 --> 48:44.363
Oh, they did. But still, it couldn't have
been easy mobilizing your whole family.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.632
They love the challenge.

48:47.291 --> 48:49.703
Plus, they've never
worked on a historic lodge.

48:49.760 --> 48:52.240
I mean, you saw how excited they were

48:52.296 --> 48:53.969
when they checked under the hood.

48:54.632 --> 48:56.942
I think they found more wrong
than I ever could've guessed.

48:59.603 --> 49:02.812
You know, we had an old saying
in historic preservation.

49:04.542 --> 49:05.577
What is it?

49:06.243 --> 49:09.156
Find the problem is the
first step in fixing it.

49:10.080 --> 49:11.388
I like that saying.

49:13.918 --> 49:17.730
So um, what did Kent think
about you coming up here?

49:20.558 --> 49:23.164
Uh, Kent and I, we're
not dating anymore.

49:23.594 --> 49:25.301
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

49:30.234 --> 49:33.113
So what about you? Does
Mrs. Rand work in the city?

49:34.638 --> 49:39.178
Uh, no. Mrs. Rand passed away
shortly after Charlene was born.

49:41.145 --> 49:42.351
I'm sorry to hear that.

49:42.480 --> 49:45.518
No, it's all right. I firmly
believe she's with the Lord.

49:47.852 --> 49:51.629
You know to be honest, I'm
not sure she liked it up here.

49:53.591 --> 49:55.696
This place can be
really hard on city folk.

49:56.494 --> 49:58.872
You gotta really love the
outdoors to live here year round.

49:58.996 --> 49:59.997
Oh, I know.

50:00.097 --> 50:01.667
You still come up here in the winter?

50:02.099 --> 50:05.808
Especially the winter! I
mean, it's so beautiful...

50:05.936 --> 50:11.318
the snow, the quiet. You
know, I savor the quiet.

50:12.443 --> 50:14.480
Sometimes I snowshoe into
the middle of the park

50:14.545 --> 50:17.355
just to have a legal reason
not to hear a cell phone.

50:18.516 --> 50:21.292
Well we're so remote you don't
even get a cell phone signal.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.059
Even the landline is spotty.

50:23.187 --> 50:25.895
Bliss! I'll have to tell my
dad not to fix that either.

50:27.024 --> 50:29.698
I uh... got the details worked out.

50:30.861 --> 50:32.807
I'm not gonna like this, am I?

50:36.834 --> 50:39.713
Just remember, the
report is the first step.

50:40.371 --> 50:41.907
And we'll help you with the rest.

50:42.039 --> 50:42.915
Thank you.

50:46.043 --> 50:49.047
So, what's, what's the damage?

50:49.179 --> 50:56.154
Well, the good news is the major
structure is largely intact.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.529
They knew what they were
doing when they used cedar

50:58.656 --> 51:02.661
to build this place, it's stronger
than concrete in these conditions.

51:02.726 --> 51:05.900
Now, with a little
patching, the uh, roof

51:06.030 --> 51:10.035
and the walls can be brought up to
code. The trusses and the support

51:10.167 --> 51:13.944
beams are in good shape too,
and the foundation is flawless.

51:14.071 --> 51:16.745
Okay. So, we're all set then!

51:17.174 --> 51:21.213
Uh, not quite! The uh,
electrical, plumbing

51:21.278 --> 51:23.189
and healing systems are
old and beginning to fail.

51:23.280 --> 51:26.420
Your kitchen is worn to
the point of posing hazard.

51:27.918 --> 51:30.899
Now, an awful lot of your windows
are cracked from the storms,

51:31.221 --> 51:34.566
your gutters and some of the
decorative features have dry rot

51:34.692 --> 51:37.229
and some of your floorboards
will have lo be replaced.

51:37.361 --> 51:38.431
Is that all?

51:38.562 --> 51:42.066
Uh... once your repairs are
completed, you're gonna have to

51:42.199 --> 51:44.645
repaint the exterior and refinish
the interior, and that has to be done

51:44.768 --> 51:47.806
in a way that preserves the
historical character of the lodge.

51:48.372 --> 51:50.249
So what's the bottom line?

51:51.275 --> 51:53.312
In drawing up the
estimate, we try to find

51:53.444 --> 51:55.424
the most cost effective solutions.

51:55.546 --> 51:56.752
And...

51:56.880 --> 51:58.985
$1.8 to $2 million.

52:01.452 --> 52:03.898
Ha!!!!!! Wow. I don't
have that kinda money.

52:03.988 --> 52:06.229
Don't worry cuz that's,
that's where I come in.

52:06.290 --> 52:08.429
Now all these documents are necessary

52:08.492 --> 52:10.301
to apply to my company's
board for funding.

52:11.261 --> 52:13.434
Now, my boss and I, we're
gonna have to push hard

52:13.497 --> 52:15.306
to get them to take on a
project outside of the city,

52:15.432 --> 52:17.639
but I really feel like
they will come around

52:17.735 --> 52:19.646
when they realize the
history that's gonna be saved

52:19.737 --> 52:21.478
in renovating Christmas Lodge.

52:21.972 --> 52:23.315
That's a lot of paper.

52:23.440 --> 52:26.649
It is, but don't worry, I'll go through
it with you tomorrow page by page,

52:26.777 --> 52:29.815
while Dad and they boys
work to stabilize the lodge.

52:30.314 --> 52:31.622
So what do you say?

52:32.816 --> 52:35.820
Now, if we do this, is there a chance

52:35.919 --> 52:38.263
that we could be open by Christmas?

52:40.190 --> 52:42.932
Well, where there's a
will there's a way, right?

52:45.129 --> 52:46.870
Let's do it.
- Great!

52:47.965 --> 52:49.774
Well, I don't know about you kids,

52:49.833 --> 52:53.679
but these old bones need
a rest. Good night, Jack.

52:54.138 --> 52:55.879
Good night Dad.
- Good night Jack.

52:57.641 --> 52:58.881
Good night Mary.

53:00.444 --> 53:01.616
Good night everyone.

53:12.790 --> 53:14.736
So, what's the plan for today?

53:16.226 --> 53:19.207
Well, I looked over the list of
repairs and circled the problem areas

53:19.329 --> 53:21.366
that are posing an immediate threat

53:21.532 --> 53:24.536
or any damage to the exterior
that's letting the weather in.

53:24.668 --> 53:26.477
I'll make some temporary
fixes to stabilize the lodge

53:26.537 --> 53:28.175
so it won't get any worse

53:28.238 --> 53:30.650
by the time the contractors
you hired get up here.

53:30.808 --> 53:31.912
I appreciate it.

53:33.977 --> 53:35.081
Morning.

53:35.212 --> 53:36.748
Morning!
- How'd you sleep?

53:37.381 --> 53:38.257
Great!

53:38.348 --> 53:40.157
She kept you up talking, didn't she?

53:40.250 --> 53:43.823
Uh, that's kind of the whole point
of a slumber party, right Charlene?

53:43.887 --> 53:44.865
Yeah.

53:45.189 --> 53:47.897
Well, we'd better get started on the
paperwork, it's gonna take a couple hours.

53:47.991 --> 53:50.494
Yup. Been warming up all morning.

53:51.228 --> 53:52.730
Well we should get at it.

54:07.411 --> 54:08.412
Last one!

54:08.545 --> 54:11.526
My hand is less sore from
swinging an axe all day.

54:12.449 --> 54:14.395
Not bad for $2 million.

54:15.119 --> 54:16.723
No, it's not bad at all.

54:28.298 --> 54:30.642
I can't tell you how great
it was having you all up here.

54:31.101 --> 54:33.206
When you think you're gonna
make it back this way again?

54:33.370 --> 54:36.283
Oh, you know what? I come up
camping all the time in the summer.

54:36.607 --> 54:38.314
I'll be sure to swing by next time.

54:38.408 --> 54:39.887
Oh, can you take me with you?

54:39.977 --> 54:40.978
Charlene!

54:41.278 --> 54:44.316
Of course. If it's okay with your dad.

54:44.414 --> 54:49.762
Oh yeah, it's okay with her dad. With all this
work around here I don't get out on the trail

54:49.887 --> 54:53.801
as much as I'd like to. Yeah,
Charlene probably deserves a break.

54:54.324 --> 54:56.964
Well' all right then. I'll call you.

54:57.461 --> 55:00.340
You don't need to, family
can drop by any time.

55:00.798 --> 55:03.904
Oh, thank you. All
right, you two take care.

55:12.176 --> 55:14.349
You like Mary, don't you?

55:14.478 --> 55:18.119
What? Where do you
come up with this stuff?

55:18.248 --> 55:22.492
Come on! She's likes you too.

55:23.921 --> 55:25.298
What did she tell you?

55:25.823 --> 55:33.867
No, but I can tell. I like
Mary, Dad. I like her a lot.

55:48.645 --> 55:51.854
Bob, hi! So, what did the board say?

55:51.982 --> 55:54.724
They're willing to give us half
the funding, but that's all.

55:54.818 --> 55:56.695
We'll have to find the
other half somewhere else.

55:56.820 --> 55:59.664
I am grateful but it's gonna take
too long to find outside funding.

56:00.157 --> 56:01.227
Too long for what?

56:01.358 --> 56:04.965
For Christmas Lodge, for my grandfather.
Look, time is not on their side.

56:06.463 --> 56:07.806
Can I talk to the chairman?

56:07.898 --> 56:10.538
I'm sorry Mary, but he's
ready to call it a night.

56:10.667 --> 56:13.580
Bob, please.

56:16.573 --> 56:17.483
Thank you.

56:19.309 --> 56:20.845
Excuse me, Thomas.

56:20.978 --> 56:21.979
What is it?

56:22.646 --> 56:24.819
Mary Tobin would like to say a few words

56:24.915 --> 56:27.691
in favor of the Christmas Lodge project.

56:28.218 --> 56:29.595
We just spent a whole day on it-.

56:29.720 --> 56:33.532
Please, I'm sure that Bob did a
superb job on presenting the facts

56:33.657 --> 56:37.161
but I would like to let you know
about the faces behind those facts.

56:37.261 --> 56:40.538
You see, Christmas Lodge is
not just a restoration project,

56:41.098 --> 56:43.601
it's a labor of love. My family...

56:43.734 --> 56:46.544
Mary, we all understand your family
has a long history with the lodge,

56:46.603 --> 56:48.082
and we took it into consideration

56:48.205 --> 56:49.684
when we granted you partial funding.

56:49.740 --> 56:52.380
If we give you any more
funding we'll break the budget.

56:52.442 --> 56:54.353
But half is as good as none.

56:54.444 --> 56:56.754
I mean, Christmas
Lodge is disintegrating,

56:56.847 --> 56:58.520
and it might hit the point of no return

56:58.615 --> 57:00.060
if the roof gives in this winter.

57:00.751 --> 57:01.889
I'm sorry Mary.

57:04.054 --> 57:05.089
Mary...

57:07.424 --> 57:08.767
you did your best.

57:09.793 --> 57:11.795
Yeah, try telling that
to Jack and Charlene...

57:12.963 --> 57:14.135
and my grandfather.

57:17.100 --> 57:18.101
Thanks Bob.

57:22.572 --> 57:25.485
I talked to the chairman,
and after all that work,

57:25.609 --> 57:28.385
all the work you and the boys
did, all that paperwork...

57:29.947 --> 57:30.948
Mary?

57:32.049 --> 57:33.494
Grandpa! Hey.

57:38.155 --> 57:40.897
How's the lodge coming?

57:43.260 --> 57:47.640
Well it's... not as good as I had hoped.

57:49.299 --> 57:50.334
What's wrong?

57:51.335 --> 57:53.144
Oh, Grandpa I don't want to trouble you.

57:53.570 --> 57:55.447
You're not troubling me! I...

57:56.473 --> 58:01.354
I may be stuck in this bed, but
I'm still part of this world.

58:03.814 --> 58:08.661
Well, you know, we have
enough funding for the supplies

58:08.785 --> 58:11.095
but we're still praying
for money for a crew.

58:14.624 --> 58:17.434
Didn't I give a construction
company to a crew

58:17.494 --> 58:20.498
who could get the job
done right and on time?

58:21.798 --> 58:23.641
The boys and I are
booked through New Years.

58:23.767 --> 58:24.711
With what?

58:25.435 --> 58:27.642
Odds and ends.
- Well cancel them!

58:27.771 --> 58:30.877
We can't! We have a
responsibility to our customers.

58:31.341 --> 58:35.346
There are plenty of crews
looking for work around here,

58:36.380 --> 58:39.793
there are very few contractors
up in the mountains.

58:41.685 --> 58:45.189
You give the odds and ends
to the city contractors

58:45.322 --> 58:46.801
and go and help Jack Rand!

58:46.890 --> 58:52.033
Now Dad, I wish it was that
easy. We all have bills to pay,

58:52.162 --> 58:54.472
who's gonna write us a check
to go work on the lodge?

58:55.665 --> 58:56.575
Me.

58:56.666 --> 58:57.576
You?

58:57.701 --> 59:01.581
You tell me what you need to get the
job done and I'll write the check.

59:02.205 --> 59:05.743
I don't know, Dad. None
of this seems right.

59:06.209 --> 59:10.021
Letting Christmas Lodge
turn to dust doesn't either.

59:11.048 --> 59:14.257
Our family took a lot from
the lodge over the years,

59:14.751 --> 59:22.863
it's time to give back. I...
I want this to be my legacy,

59:23.393 --> 59:27.864
and your inheritance. What do you say?

59:28.832 --> 59:30.903
I'm sorry, but no.

59:33.070 --> 59:37.018
Let me describe it another way.

59:39.543 --> 59:43.548
I remember a tale of a carpenter

59:43.680 --> 59:49.130
that would not turn down this job
regardless of money or convenience.

59:49.219 --> 59:50.095
Who?

59:50.587 --> 59:57.436
He was a man from Galilee, who
saw service to those in need

59:57.961 --> 01:00:06.107
as his highest calling.
Now, when you consider

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:10.718
helping Jack who has the
greatest need right now

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:17.053
with no help in sight, or
your other responsibilities,

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:22.254
you might well ask yourself,

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:24.424
what would Jesus do?

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:31.231
With his guidance, I really believe

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.135
you'll make the right decision.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.610
You know I can't argue with scripture.

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:42.006
Then don't! Do the
right thing, help Jack.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.081
You always get me, don't you?

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:48.252
It's not me.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:53.154
It's the Lord's lessons I live
by that put us on the right path.

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:59.431
You tell me what you want from me
and the boys, and we'll be there.

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:02.336
Really?

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:03.502
Yeah.

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:05.768
Thank you Dad.

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:08.473
Oh, thank you, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:18.712
And thank you, Grandpa.
You never let me down.

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:23.316
That's because you
never let me down, kid.

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:31.896
You know, if they keep up this
pace we might be done by Christmas.

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:33.695
Really, you think so?

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:37.668
It'll go even faster if we help them.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.362
How?

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:42.140
Come on, follow Pete.

01:01:45.669 --> 01:01:47.239
All right, so you take the sand block,

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:50.214
watch your fingers, and you wanna
work with the grain of the wood.

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:51.375
Okay? Look.
- How?

01:01:51.508 --> 01:01:54.489
This way... and here.

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:56.353
Think you can do it?

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:57.856
All right'

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:07.334
Hey, look at you go! And what
do you think you're doing?

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:10.030
Well, I can't let the
boys have all the fun Dad.

01:02:10.427 --> 01:02:12.373
You haven't been on site in 10 years.

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:14.841
Feels good to be back.

01:02:19.603 --> 01:02:21.048
You sure you're up for this?

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:23.206
I didn't spend my entire
life behind a desk.

01:02:23.373 --> 01:02:24.716
You know, my Grandpa had me on his crew

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:27.015
when I was a little
bit older than Charlene.

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:30.182
I could sink a nail faster and
cleaner than any of his men.

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:32.019
Prove it.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:41.235
Hey, I thought I heard
the human nail gun.

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:44.430
That's my girl. After all these years
you still haven't lost your touch.

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.542
I haven't been this tired in...

01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:52.242
since as long as I can remember.

01:02:52.402 --> 01:02:57.147
Yeah me either. Feels good though,

01:02:58.642 --> 01:03:04.752
can't figure out why, but it does.
There's something about this place.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:09.992
My great grandparents used to say that
uh, they didn't build Christmas Lodge

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:14.762
to have a place to live,
they built it to live.

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:19.497
And I think they would be
very, very happy to know

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:21.576
that the people who share a past

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:24.339
are here to look after
her in her old age.

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:25.673
That's sweet.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:30.179
By the time we're through,
she'll look 50 years younger.

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:33.185
I wish we could do the same for Grandpa.

01:03:34.678 --> 01:03:38.091
We all do. He's climbing the ladder

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:43.292
we'll all climb one day.
He's just happy knowing

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:47.457
we're all together and giving
an important part of history

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:50.334
a new lease on life?

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.671
Has your family always been this close?

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:58.304
Well, we've wandered
some here and there,

01:03:59.102 --> 01:04:01.844
but we've always found
time to meet in the kitchen.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:07.647
Well, I just hope that when
we're through, I can restore

01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:09.950
some of that sense of home.

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:14.525
Speaking of kitchens, I
think I have one to clean up.

01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:15.857
Here, let me help you out.

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:21.800
Mary, I was uh...

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:25.996
What Jack?

01:04:26.563 --> 01:04:28.839
Wow, I am not very good at this.

01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:30.503
What is it?

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.921
Um...We spent a lot of time together
over the last few months and uh, I guess

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:44.184
you could say I've
taken a liking to you.

01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:47.386
I hope that doesn't
make you uncomfortable.

01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:52.190
No! I mean of course not, I'm honored.

01:04:53.156 --> 01:04:58.572
Well uh, I was wondering

01:04:58.695 --> 01:05:04.702
if maybe we could be more than friends.
If maybe we could go out together sometime.

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:08.711
Oh, Jack I don't know.

01:05:08.772 --> 01:05:11.116
I really don't have a great
track record with men and it...

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:16.418
it wouldn't just be us, it
would be us and Charlene,

01:05:16.546 --> 01:05:18.685
and I don't want her to get hurt

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:23.026
if it didn't work out.

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:25.292
You were the one that said
anything's possible, right?

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:27.257
I did.

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:29.233
That means something
good is possible too.

01:05:29.359 --> 01:05:31.464
I just haven't noticed
any bad points between us,

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:34.371
have you?
- No... no.

01:05:35.799 --> 01:05:41.044
Then take a chance on
me, Mary. Let's just start

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:45.315
by maybe going to dinner,
dancing, a movie...

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:48.651
Something normal grown ups do
when they're going out as friends.

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:52.116
And if it doesn't work out,
Charlene doesn't have to know

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:55.320
that we were courting

01:05:57.587 --> 01:06:02.332
and we could still be
friends. What do you think?

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:13.644
Did I misread you? ls
it that hard to decide?

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:16.750
No, no Jack... my
reluctance has absolutely

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:23.516
nothing to do with you whatsoever,
it's just... there's so much at stake,

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.455
I really um, I don't wanna mess it up.

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:27.993
Okay. So the answer's no.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:31.029
No.

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:37.763
No it's a yes. I am willing

01:06:37.861 --> 01:06:40.842
to take that chance with you
because I feel the same way

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.534
and I'm so tired of fighting it.

01:06:58.882 --> 01:07:00.987
Wow, you guys are really
moving right along!

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:03.791
Have to, the weather's not going
to stay like this much longer.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.231
When winter hits up here, it hits hard.

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:07.891
Won't be able to see
the roof or the walls

01:07:07.991 --> 01:07:09.800
under 15 feet of snow.

01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:10.871
Bye you guys!

01:07:10.994 --> 01:07:11.995
Bye!

01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:15.371
I feel so bad leaving you. You know
that I wouldn't, I would stay and help

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:18.708
if I wasn't in the final
days of the Wharf project.

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:21.509
Your hands are itchin' to
pick up a hammer aren't they?

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:23.810
That's my girl.

01:07:24.807 --> 01:07:26.878
Check in on your mother
and your grandfather for me,

01:07:26.976 --> 01:07:29.513
tell them I'll get down for a couple
of days when we get the place sealed up.

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:32.525
I will, thanks Daddy. I love you.

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:36.595
Mary! Wait up a sec?

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:37.493
Yeah.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:40.100
I better get back to work.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:44.068
Hey.

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:50.610
Listen uh, I was just wondering, and I
know this is short notice and all but uh,

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:54.909
I was wondering if it would be possible for
your family to come and stay here this Christmas.

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:59.250
Really? Of course. I've
just, I've always hoped

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:01.788
to get my family back out
here for one more Christmas,

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.390
especially my grandpa.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:04.721
Great.

01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:08.290
Maybe we should keep
this between us for now

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:10.261
because there's so much work to be done

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:12.195
and I don't want to disappoint
them if the lodge isn't ready.

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:13.359
I understand.

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:15.527
But, thank you.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:19.796
Drive safe.

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:22.140
I'll talk to you soon.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.657
I was right. Wasn't I?

01:08:47.991 --> 01:08:51.768
While you were gone,
I met with the board

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:55.401
and I explained the situation
to them, and they agreed

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:59.002
to go to our donors to
seek funding to expand out

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:00.671
to the rural areas.

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:05.252
We already have the funding
for a project or two.

01:09:05.742 --> 01:09:06.812
Oh!

01:09:06.943 --> 01:09:11.585
So, would you be interested in
opening a branch office out there

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.594
to coordinate our efforts?

01:09:15.585 --> 01:09:16.359
Yes?

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.523
Yo, do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:24.535
What's up?

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:30.609
Bob just asked me to open
an office in the mountains.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:32.042
He what?

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.876
Yeah, he wants to help small
towns save historic buildings.

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:38.680
Wow. Four hours, that's along commute.

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:42.654
No, no I mean, l wouldn't be
driving there, I would move there.

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:45.658
Hmm, let me guess... to Christmas Lodge?

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:49.323
All right Mary, fess up.

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:52.491
It's no coincidence that you
broke up with one perfect man

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:54.535
to now agree to work
near another perfect man.

01:09:55.058 --> 01:09:57.629
Have you been seeing Jack Rand?
- Is it that obvious?

01:09:57.694 --> 01:10:00.197
I knew it! You've been so happy lately.

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:03.037
Well maybe you'll get
that ring after all.

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:04.907
Okay, let's not be ridiculous.

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:06.906
I have work to do.

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:10.245
Oh my gosh, that's
fantastic. Wait a second.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.682
Yeah?

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.984
You're leaving the city
to go work in the country,

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:17.254
who's taking your position here?

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.084
Uh, you!

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:23.493
No, no, no, no. This is one
Christmas gift I don't want.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:27.262
You know, I said that 10 years
ago and look where it got me.

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.233
Yeah, you dropped it on me.

01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:31.338
Well, for one thing I
think that you can do it,

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:34.568
and for another thing you have
been doing it, and quite well.

01:10:35.198 --> 01:10:36.734
So... Merry Christmas.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.044
God...

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:39.911
Hang on a sec.

01:10:40.036 --> 01:10:41.071
Okay. So the answer's no.

01:10:43.106 --> 01:10:44.107
Mom!

01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:47.514
Yeah.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.454
What?

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:57.030
Uh, no... I'll... I'll meet you there.

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:06.205
I have to go to the hospital,
my grandfather just had a stroke.

01:11:11.234 --> 01:11:14.977
Mom, hey. How is he? Hi Daddy.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.447
They're still evaluating him.

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:19.041
Can we see him?
- Not yet honey.

01:11:21.711 --> 01:11:25.921
Hey you guys. ls uh, is
Kathy in there with him?

01:11:26.082 --> 01:11:30.087
Yeah, and a group of doctors.
Listen, he's in good hands.

01:11:34.157 --> 01:11:37.661
So I guess this means that he's going
to have to go to a home now right?

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:39.670
Your mother and Cathy
did the best they could.

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:44.609
Of course. Mom, I know that you
and Cathy did everything you could.

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:50.306
Hey, hi. How is he?

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:52.146
Stable and resting.

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:53.515
Will they need to operate?

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:56.146
No, it was a fairly mild stroke.

01:11:56.279 --> 01:11:58.953
The doctors think he's
lost some motor skills.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:00.460
Can we see him?

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:02.824
The doctors need to
conduct additional tests,

01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:04.659
when they're done you can see him.

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:07.200
Thanks Kathy, thanks for everything.

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:14.697
I love that photo.
- I do too.

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:26.651
Yes. You know Mom, I
had a dream that Grandpa

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:28.518
and I would walk
together in the mountains,

01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:31.356
and he would point out every leaf,

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:34.454
every bird, every tree, every ridge

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:37.864
and not just tell me what it
was, but what it meant to him.

01:12:39.322 --> 01:12:41.131
He breathed so much
life into this world,

01:12:41.224 --> 01:12:46.367
I try to get it back on my own
but it's just...it's not the same.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:49.669
Your grandfather is a very special man.

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:54.007
You were the only one who truly
listened to what he had to say,

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:57.984
and he rewarded you with a
richer appreciation of the world.

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.361
Can I tell you something even sillier?

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:09.822
Of course.

01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:16.998
Grandpa said that the Lord and
Grandma spoke to him every time

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:22.407
he went hiking. He found
such strength and peace,

01:13:23.666 --> 01:13:27.546
and I actually thought
that they were speaking

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:29.742
to me the day that they put Charlene
and Christmas Lodge in my path.

01:13:30.439 --> 01:13:31.941
And they were telling me

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:35.248
to repay Grandpa somehow
for everything he's given me.

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:39.523
Maybe they were, maybe they still are.

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:43.956
I spent many hours with
Grandpa after he got sick,

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:48.266
and he told me many times that
his illness was for a reason,

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:53.203
that God was trying to tell him
something. When I asked what, he told me

01:13:53.296 --> 01:13:58.302
that he didn't know for sure, but that
throughout his life from the Great Depression

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:02.779
to fighting World War ll, to working
on his dangerous construction sites

01:14:02.905 --> 01:14:06.250
and most challenging of all,

01:14:06.309 --> 01:14:09.552
the passing of your grandmother,
that God let him know

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:16.153
that he was there for him. He said many
times that he didn't tell him what to do,

01:14:16.252 --> 01:14:20.257
but that his scriptures let him
lead the good life that he was

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:24.064
intended to lead, even
when he felt like giving up.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:31.509
So you're saying that I should trust
in the Lord to give me strength,

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.776
even if it means putting
Grandpa in a home.

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:38.578
Your grandfather isn't
happy about this decision,

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:40.645
but he did tell your
father that he knows

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:43.450
it's best for him and the family.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:45.682
Thanks Mom.

01:14:48.918 --> 01:14:51.694
That helps. Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:54.932
This is where you rescued
me and Natty, remember?

01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:58.870
Of course I remember. You know, that
was the most important day of my life?

01:14:58.995 --> 01:14:59.837
Why?

01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:03.334
God and my grandmother
talked to me that day.

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:05.173
Really? What did they say?

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:09.014
They said that I need to
spend more time here with them.

01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:12.780
And that you were their messenger,
that you were their special gift.

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.119
I was?

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:15.553
You were, and still are.

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:19.850
Do you still think they're gonna
be done in time for Christmas?

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:22.486
Oh, you know only time will tell.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:24.464
Is your grandpa gonna be there?

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.691
I don't think so Charlene.

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:28.300
Why not?

01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:31.167
Well, he's you know,
he's trying to bounce back

01:15:31.327 --> 01:15:32.704
from the stroke but it's
been really hard on him.

01:15:33.329 --> 01:15:34.569
But you promised.

01:15:35.798 --> 01:15:38.369
Well, I didn't really promise.

01:15:39.402 --> 01:15:41.075
I just want a grandpa again.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:47.549
Honey I know, I understand.
Believe me, I understand.

01:15:48.344 --> 01:15:52.588
You know what, now we just, we just
have to pray for the best, right?

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:54.191
Yeah.

01:16:06.429 --> 01:16:09.842
I have cookies! Grandpa, whoa!

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:13.943
Hey, how you doing?

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:21.085
Better than yesterday. It's almost
time for my physical therapy.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:23.784
Whoa, physical therapy?

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:26.120
It's not as fun as it sounds.

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:28.551
Grandpa, I'm so proud of you.

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:31.720
You'd think I had won the Olympics.

01:16:32.555 --> 01:16:34.796
Well, can I come with you?

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:38.633
Of course, of course
kid. The more the merrier.

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:43.073
I can't imagine a better coach.

01:16:43.466 --> 01:16:45.468
Oh, you might regret saying that.

01:16:51.807 --> 01:16:52.717
Comin' through!

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:05.323
You guys, it smells delicious!

01:17:05.421 --> 01:17:07.128
It will be!

01:17:14.997 --> 01:17:16.271
Oh, he's here!

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:25.110
Who's the movie star?

01:17:25.774 --> 01:17:27.481
That's Jack.

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:28.748
Your new flame?

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:32.955
What is it with you two?
We go to dinner as friends,

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:35.585
can't a woman have a man as a friend?

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.028
No!

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:40.698
Behave.

01:17:41.457 --> 01:17:42.197
Hey!

01:17:42.758 --> 01:17:43.828
Charlene, hi.

01:17:43.926 --> 01:17:46.338
This is my mom and
this is my sister Cathy.

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:49.207
Glad to meet you again Jack, Charlene!

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:50.207
Hi.

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:51.936
Mary and the boys have
told us so much about you,

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:54.105
you're already a part
of the family! Come in.

01:17:54.203 --> 01:17:55.807
Thank you for welcoming
us into your home.

01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:57.340
Come in, come in.

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:03.489
Where's your grandpa?

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:05.821
Oh, Charlene he couldn't make it.

01:18:06.115 --> 01:18:07.116
Why not?

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:09.459
He's still not feeling
well, but he's working on it.

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:11.363
Can we go see him?

01:18:11.487 --> 01:18:14.195
Oh, Charlene. Not today.

01:18:15.324 --> 01:18:16.632
What about Christmas?

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.662
Let's talk about it later, okay?

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:21.638
We must watch the costs!

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:24.839
Jack, glad you could make it.
- Good to be here.

01:18:24.967 --> 01:18:26.913
Any trouble getting here?
- No, it was a nice ride.

01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:30.080
Okay, everybody. Turkey's on,

01:18:30.506 --> 01:18:33.715
come to the table!
Thank you for your help.

01:18:34.677 --> 01:18:35.849
Smells good, mother.

01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:39.818
Father, would you say Grace?

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:51.698
Heavenly father, thank you for the many
blessings you have given our family.

01:18:52.428 --> 01:18:56.535
We are all eternally grateful for your
love, and the love of those who are here

01:18:56.665 --> 01:19:01.171
and those who live with you in
heaven. I pray that you accept

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:03.876
our thanks and prayers as
we strive to live every day

01:19:04.006 --> 01:19:07.351
in the way that celebrates the
many gifts you have given us.

01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:12.916
We also pray that you help my father,
Mike Sr., who's long sewed as a beacon

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:16.120
of spiritual and moral
leadership to us all,

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:19.233
get better so that he
can once again join our

01:19:19.288 --> 01:19:23.031
family table. Amen.

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:24.399
Amen.

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:28.568
And now, if you will pass me one of your

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:30.573
Christmas Lodge biscuits...

01:19:48.584 --> 01:19:51.588
Well this is the best
Thanksgiving we've had in years.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.290
I'm so glad.

01:19:55.591 --> 01:19:58.731
Does your family always take
in strays so effortlessly?

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:01.938
Well, they do if they like them.

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:05.442
Take a seat.

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:13.646
So, I have great news.

01:20:13.742 --> 01:20:17.315
Your grandpa can make it for Christmas?

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:21.788
No, that would be excellent
news, this is just great news.

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:23.758
Okay, what is it?

01:20:24.353 --> 01:20:26.162
I found a new location for the office.

01:20:28.457 --> 01:20:32.963
Is it uh...a little bit
close to the lodge maybe?

01:20:33.095 --> 01:20:35.666
It's...10 miles away.

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:38.672
That's great, Charlene
is gonna be thrilled.

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:41.605
Now what about places to stay,
you found a place to stay yet?

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.206
No, still looking.

01:20:48.143 --> 01:20:49.986
You know, if um...

01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:55.157
if we were married, you could
probably stay up at the lodge

01:20:55.651 --> 01:20:56.823
Probably.

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:59.356
Jack, don't toy with me.

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:02.166
What if I'm not toying with you?

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:11.302
Look uh, I don't think that we
should be having this conversation,

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:13.911
maybe I'm just not ready.

01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:15.844
I don't mean to upset you.

01:21:16.004 --> 01:21:17.711
No, you're not upsetting me. I just...
I don't think that the timing is right.

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:22.755
I don't think that the
timing is right. Okay?

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:25.991
It's okay.

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:52.346
Care to do the honors?

01:21:52.441 --> 01:21:55.251
This is your lodge son,
your past, your future.

01:21:55.377 --> 01:21:57.357
Well none of this would've been
possible without your family's help.

01:21:57.446 --> 01:21:58.550
Our family.

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.057
Without our family's help.

01:22:00.182 --> 01:22:03.254
I wouldn't say that, you're
the one who kept things going.

01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:05.558
Uh, Dad... Jack, I appreciate the
mutual fan club for each other,

01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:07.792
but there are a lot
of people waiting so...

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:10.869
Jack, please.
- I'd better go get the door.

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:13.463
No, no. Not until you
light this house up.

01:22:13.562 --> 01:22:15.633
Okay, hands. Hands!

01:22:17.366 --> 01:22:19.972
Three, two, one!

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:28.278
Lamb sake's alive, would
you look at this place!

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:30.245
Grandpa?

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:33.884
Grandpa you made it! You made it.

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:34.950
Yes.

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:35.891
You're here!

01:22:37.753 --> 01:22:38.663
Grandpa?

01:22:39.588 --> 01:22:40.566
Finally!

01:22:40.656 --> 01:22:43.330
Who is this little angel?

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:44.995
That is my daughter Charlene.

01:22:46.094 --> 01:22:48.233
Who are you?
- Jack Rand.

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:51.174
Little Jackie?

01:22:51.834 --> 01:22:54.576
My goodness, you are the
spitting image of your father

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:59.813
and your grandfather. I know
for a fact that they'd be proud

01:22:59.942 --> 01:23:03.151
of what you and my boys
have done. Christmas Lodge.

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:07.458
Why, she looks like she did the
first Christmas that me and my Mavis

01:23:07.516 --> 01:23:09.189
spent up here.

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:11.958
Well without your generosity none
of that would've been possible, Sir.

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:14.328
It's a drop in the bucket.

01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:16.801
Oh, come on Grandpa,
we know that's not true.

01:23:16.925 --> 01:23:18.666
Well excuse me, I have to
go check on the turkey so

01:23:18.794 --> 01:23:20.671
Charlene... Excuse me, sorry.

01:23:20.796 --> 01:23:22.173
He's here! He's here!

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:25.937
Hey you guys! How you doing? You
wanna put the presents over there?

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:33.349
Good to see you. How did you get here?

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:35.386
Well, Dad, Morn and the rest
of us pooled our money together

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:38.720
and bought a special van as a
Christmas gift for the whole family.

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:41.688
And you just... you didn't tell me?

01:23:42.618 --> 01:23:44.791
We wanted to make it a
surprise. Well, it is.

01:23:45.821 --> 01:23:50.861
It's really um...the
best kind of surprise.

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:54.801
Grandpa, I knew you'd make it!

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.540
Dad...

01:24:03.906 --> 01:24:04.884
Not now, Charlene.

01:24:06.909 --> 01:24:08.684
Um, I'd like to propose a toast.

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:12.756
To my great grandparents who uh,

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:18.358
who built Christmas Lodge with love
and an appreciation of the mountains

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.591
God gave this blessed Earth.

01:24:22.357 --> 01:24:26.828
I'd like to propose a toast
to my grandparents and parents

01:24:26.929 --> 01:24:31.207
who kept the lodge running through
a depression, and uh, wars and uh,

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:34.041
biblical storms.

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:41.187
And I'd also like to thank all of
you. Uh... especially Grandpa Tobin,

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:43.753
Mai?'

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:50.858
Mike, Matt, Pete... the labor and uh, for
providing us with the funds, the materials,

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:58.296
the love we needed to uh,
give her the second chance

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:04.378
she so richly deserves. Myself and
uh, Charlene and all of the Rands

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:11.213
who came before us are eternally
indebted to you. Cheers!

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:13.616
Cheers! Cheers!

01:25:17.713 --> 01:25:22.560
If you bear with me, I have
one more thing I'd like to say.

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:31.631
Oh, Jack...

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:35.567
Mary, your uh, father and mother
have already given their blessing

01:25:35.664 --> 01:25:37.166
and now I'd like to ask you.

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:41.178
Will you take my hand in marriage?

01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:45.183
Will you be my wife
and Charlene's mother?

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:48.280
Please Mary?

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:52.285
Of course. Of course.

01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:01.834
Bravo!

01:26:01.957 --> 01:26:03.095
All right.

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:04.431
Congratulations.

01:26:17.706 --> 01:26:19.481
Oh, Grandpa!

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:22.884
I promised I'd play for
you, when I got out again.

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:37.728
And so when our very first
Christmas together as a family

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:40.169
at the historic Christmas Lodge,

01:26:40.796 --> 01:26:43.902
more families joined us that Christmas
than I ever thought we could handle.

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:47.036
But we did. Jack knew what to do.

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:49.580
And my family filled into
make sure that the guests

01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:53.915
had the same unforgettable Christmas
that we had there decades before.

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:59.353
And through it all, I felt the
presence of God, my grandmother,

01:26:59.414 --> 01:27:02.554
and the members of Jack's family
who were no longer with us.

01:27:03.085 --> 01:27:05.497
It was comforting to have
them looking out for us.

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:10.326
Every day I realize that
the past never leaves us,

01:27:10.492 --> 01:27:14.907
it's as present and important as it ever 
was. We just have to make an effort

01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:19.240
with love, strength, and commitment,
to bring it back again.

01:27:19.868 --> 01:27:24.544
The spirit of Christmas Lodge is
our heritage and it is our future.

01:27:26.508 --> 01:27:29.079
They shut down the national park road,

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:33.421
we can't get to the lodge and it's
too late to go back to the city.

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:37.294
We were wondering if you
have any rooms available?

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:43.134
We say yes. Please come inside
and join our Christmas party!

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:44.259
Thank you.
