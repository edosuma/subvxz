00:09.677 --> 00:14.432
<i>NARRATOR". We have already seen
stately Wayne Manor looted by the Archer...</i>

00:14.641 --> 00:16.768
<i>...and his merry marksmen.</i>

00:19.854 --> 00:23.775
<i>He robbeth from the rich
and giveth to the poor.</i>

00:24.734 --> 00:29.531
<i>Batman and Robin called in
to investigate Bruce and Dick's loss.</i>

00:30.490 --> 00:34.285
<i>Allan A. Dale questions their efficiency...</i>

00:35.036 --> 00:37.580
<i>...and how right he is.</i>

00:39.374 --> 00:41.709
<i>The villains take off.</i>

00:43.294 --> 00:46.839
<i>And the dynamic duo
make a new friend.</i>

00:48.007 --> 00:50.552
<i>And meet a pretty Wench.</i>

00:51.719 --> 00:54.514
<i>But whose side is she on?</i>

00:55.974 --> 00:58.560
<i>The rich get poorer...</i>

00:59.727 --> 01:02.605
<i>...and the poor get richer.</i>

01:03.982 --> 01:06.693
<i>Batman and Robin on the job.</i>

01:08.027 --> 01:11.072
<i>But Archer is released on bail.</i>

01:11.864 --> 01:16.744
<i>And where has he gone?
That is the question...</i>

01:16.953 --> 01:18.955
<i>...which Alfred may help answer.</i>

01:22.292 --> 01:24.544
<i>But it's all for naught.</i>

01:25.628 --> 01:29.841
<i>Alfred subjected
to the unkindest cut of all.</i>

01:30.633 --> 01:34.804
<i>It's legerdemain
and Batman knew it all the time.</i>

01:34.971 --> 01:37.807
<i>Batman and Robin staked out.</i>

01:38.516 --> 01:42.145
<i>The Archer plans to run them through
with lances.</i>

01:42.353 --> 01:44.939
<i>Those of faint heart, look</i> away.

01:45.148 --> 01:50.069
<i>The most petrifying proceedings
have not yet come to pass.</i>

02:53.007 --> 02:54.550
There's no way out, Batman!

02:54.759 --> 02:56.719
It's always darkest
before the dawn, Robin.

02:56.928 --> 03:01.265
And since we're at the very bottom,
there's no place to go but up.

03:13.069 --> 03:15.321
The Bat Springs, now!

03:28.251 --> 03:29.794
We've got your number, Archer.

03:30.002 --> 03:34.757
Impossible, my dear sheriff of Gothamham
My number's unlisted.

03:34.966 --> 03:37.385
Marilyn, push the cheer button.

03:41.806 --> 03:42.932
It's broken.

03:43.141 --> 03:45.184
Thou hast destroyed my audience.

03:46.352 --> 03:48.604
Thou hast smashed
my ego-making machine asunder...

03:48.771 --> 03:50.398
...and rendered me helpless.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.151
Come on!

04:00.241 --> 04:03.327
- Let's go after them, Batman.
-No. By the time we reach the Batmobile...

04:03.494 --> 04:05.037
...they will have disappeared.
-But--

04:05.204 --> 04:07.123
It's all right. We'll nab them, Robin.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.375
Now, let's free Alfred.

04:26.851 --> 04:31.481
Mm. I like that cape, Batman.

04:32.940 --> 04:36.068
Very chic. Wash and wear?

04:36.235 --> 04:41.824
We're not here to discuss
my wardrobe, Mr. Dale.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.452
As administrative head
of the Wayne Foundation...

04:44.660 --> 04:49.373
...one could presume that you've been
in charge of the money from the beginning.

04:49.582 --> 04:53.461
We checked with Bruce Wayne
and he doesn't know a thing about it.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.298
He doesn't know that I am in charge
of the foundation's money?

04:57.507 --> 05:02.553
Of course he does. He is a rather
dull chap but he is not that stupid.

05:02.762 --> 05:05.264
Well, what about it?

05:06.766 --> 05:08.476
The 10 million dollars.

05:08.684 --> 05:12.271
Did Mr. Wayne send you here
to ask me that question?

05:12.480 --> 05:16.192
Every large foundation has its secrets.

05:16.818 --> 05:20.655
And employees trusted
to keep those secrets.

05:20.863 --> 05:25.701
Understandably, Mr. Wayne is concerned
about the handling of such a large sum...

05:25.910 --> 05:27.954
...and the problem of its reaching each...

05:28.162 --> 05:32.750
...of the 100,000 Gotham Cityites
to which it's assigned.

05:32.959 --> 05:34.502
I'll be no problem.

05:34.710 --> 05:41.008
Confidentially, it's coming in directly from
the government printing plant at the mint.

05:41.217 --> 05:45.638
And a very reputable firm
is delivering it to me personally.

05:45.847 --> 05:46.889
- When?
-Where?

05:47.098 --> 05:49.934
Oh, come, Batman, surely
you can't expect me to reveal...

05:50.142 --> 05:52.728
...what is obviously
such secret information.

05:52.937 --> 05:57.024
And certainly not without a letter
of approval from Mr. Wayne...

05:57.233 --> 05:59.527
...or another of the trustees.

05:59.735 --> 06:03.030
- Is the money in cash?
-Yes, Boy Wonder.

06:03.239 --> 06:08.077
Ten million dollars in crisp
new 100-dollar bills.

06:08.286 --> 06:12.874
Do you realize, sir, what might happen
if any criminal got wind of this?

06:13.082 --> 06:18.254
You misjudge the foundation's
security measures, Batman.

06:19.630 --> 06:22.592
Now, if there's nothing else.

06:22.800 --> 06:27.805
No, that's all, Mr. Dale.

06:27.972 --> 06:29.599
Good day.

06:33.311 --> 06:34.770
Well...

06:34.979 --> 06:38.566
As I said, he came to the Wayne Foundation
highly recommended.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.192
Fair is fair, Robin.

06:40.401 --> 06:44.864
No man's honesty should be suspect
without good and clear cause.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.407
Of course, Batman.

06:46.574 --> 06:49.118
I really gotta hand it to you, Archer.

06:49.327 --> 06:52.538
Hiding us out here in the
basement at police headquarters...

06:52.747 --> 06:54.957
...really was a great idea.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.542
Oh, Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn.

06:56.751 --> 06:59.921
Wouldst that thou couldst
learn to speak proper English.

07:00.588 --> 07:03.215
We couldst make such beautiful
speeches together.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.967
Oh, come off it, Archer.

07:05.176 --> 07:09.138
Everybody knows we come from
the same neighborhood.

07:09.347 --> 07:13.434
Be thou silent, Wench.
Loose lips sink ships.

07:14.185 --> 07:17.605
Ships. Wait a minute.

07:17.813 --> 07:22.443
Ships, Ships. Not a bad idea.

07:22.652 --> 07:25.780
I placed our horses in the stables
with the sheriff's horses...

07:25.988 --> 07:30.409
...so we garner the benefit of free
lodging for our steeds to boot.

07:30.618 --> 07:31.994
Good, good.

07:32.203 --> 07:35.039
Thou correctly determined the
last place the police would look for us...

07:35.206 --> 07:38.960
...was under their red-veined noses.
And thou was right.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.671
I are seldom wrong.

07:43.381 --> 07:44.966
Cut!

07:47.635 --> 07:49.345
Get out of here.

07:52.306 --> 07:56.852
Who goest there? Speakest now
or forevermore hold thy tongue.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.359
Hi ho, everybody.

08:04.276 --> 08:07.571
Salutations, Allan A. Dale.
What sayest thou?

08:07.780 --> 08:11.200
Just this: Batman and the Boy Wonder...

08:11.409 --> 08:15.329
...may have a bit of a sticky wicket
planned for you.

08:15.538 --> 08:18.958
Sticky wicket?
Thou speaketh in a unique vernacular.

08:19.166 --> 08:23.754
I speaketh,
as we say on Madison Avenue...

08:23.963 --> 08:28.134
...about our gentlemen's agreement, Archer.

08:28.342 --> 08:34.472
I was to alert you to the location of the money
when you were cut me in.

08:34.682 --> 08:37.393
Try that on for size.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.395
It fitteth.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.522
- Pray continue.
- Hmm.

08:43.899 --> 08:45.484
Well...

08:46.027 --> 08:52.742
...my latest survey tells me
that the armored can...

09:19.769 --> 09:22.229
- I don't like it.
-There's nobody on the street.

09:22.438 --> 09:23.689
Who could be firing at us?

09:25.733 --> 09:29.195
- That's brilliant, sire, brilliant.
- Excellent, my liege.

09:29.403 --> 09:33.449
Just a little device I built in my spare time
at the prison machine shop.

09:33.657 --> 09:38.829
So all right, already. You're gonna break your
arm patting yourself on the back.

09:39.038 --> 09:41.624
I'll deal with you anon.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.961
All right. Calculate the trajectory,
mon fusiliers.

09:46.170 --> 09:49.340
- Yes, my liege.
-Draw!

09:49.548 --> 09:52.343
One, two, three!

10:12.029 --> 10:14.532
- Somebody's stealing the money.
-I know, I know.

10:25.835 --> 10:28.254
For Pete's sake, whoever it was
didn't take any of the money.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.757
It looks like they jumbled it around,
but they didn't even steal a bag.

10:32.258 --> 10:36.720
<i>NARRATOR". Eight hours have passed
since that strange turn of events.</i>

10:36.929 --> 10:40.224
<i>And meanwhile,
at stately Wayne Manor...</i>

10:41.600 --> 10:43.853
- Hello.
-Bruce, this is Police Commissioner Gordon.

10:44.061 --> 10:47.064
- Yes, commissioner. Nice to talk to you again.
-This is just a reminder call.

10:47.273 --> 10:49.942
You are going to attend the official
ceremonies at city hall today?

10:50.151 --> 10:53.028
Yes, today is the day that the
Wayne Foundation is giving its gifts...

10:53.237 --> 10:56.115
...to Gotham City's needy.
-It should be very exciting.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.784
Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder,
will also be in attendance...

10:58.951 --> 11:02.872
...to make certain no incidents occur.
I am sure you'll wanna meet them.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.708
Yes, they've been great favorites
of mine for years.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.294
<i>- I'll</i> see you later, commissioner.
- Right.

11:12.047 --> 11:15.509
Aunt Harriet, something's come up
that requires my attention.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.761
- Dick's too.
-It has?

11:17.928 --> 11:20.556
- Oh.
- Immediately.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.851
Excuse us, Aunt Harriet.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.398
- Alfred.
-What's up, Bruce?

11:29.607 --> 11:30.733
- We've got trouble.
-Trouble?

11:30.941 --> 11:33.360
Real trouble, right here in Gotham City.
But I've got an idea.

11:33.527 --> 11:37.031
Alfred, meet us in the Batcave.
To the Batpoles.

11:44.747 --> 11:47.374
- Aren't you getting dressed for work?
-No. Not this time, Robin.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.752
I have to attend an official function
as Bruce Wayne...

11:49.960 --> 11:51.879
...and Batman is supposed
to be there too.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.464
How can I be of service, sir?

11:53.672 --> 11:56.258
We're trying to figure out
how Batman and Bruce Wayne...

11:56.467 --> 11:58.510
...can be in the same place
at the same time.

11:58.719 --> 12:02.139
- A knotty problem, sir, if I may say so.
-No, there's a solution, Alfred.

12:02.348 --> 12:04.934
- You'll have to change your clothes.
-My--?

12:05.100 --> 12:07.311
- My clothes, sir?
-Mm-hmm.

12:13.275 --> 12:16.111
Oh, they, uh-- They want a picture now.

12:17.029 --> 12:19.281
I understand you almost lost
the money, Mr. Dale.

12:19.490 --> 12:23.160
Yes, but as you can see,
their efforts were unsuccessful.

12:23.369 --> 12:24.995
But who knows
what might have happened...

12:25.204 --> 12:29.124
...if we'd had to depend
on those two up there.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.964
I pray our deception succeeds,
Master Robin.

12:35.172 --> 12:38.384
Just puff up your chest
and look virile, Alfred.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.136
- Good to see you.
-Thank you.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.182
Oh, glad you could come, Bruce.

12:45.849 --> 12:49.353
- Certainly a fine day for the ceremony.
-Yes, I wouldn't have missed it for anything.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.146
Who is that doing the honor?

12:51.355 --> 12:55.192
Mr. Marshall Roland, Gotham City
commissioner in charge of poor people.

12:55.401 --> 12:57.736
An old fraternity brother of mine of G.C.U.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.947
Look, they're about to start.

13:00.114 --> 13:02.866
My fellow citizens of Gotham City...

13:03.075 --> 13:08.622
...it is not often a person gets to preside
at such an auspicious occasion.

13:08.831 --> 13:12.459
Due to the gracious generosity
of the Wayne Foundation...

13:13.168 --> 13:18.132
...we are here today to carry on the work
of that fine organization.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.550
Hear, hear.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.388
I do so wish he'd get on with it.

13:24.596 --> 13:28.058
Sounds as if he's electioneering
for governor.

13:28.267 --> 13:33.188
- He's already been governor.
-Old habits are hard to break.

13:33.397 --> 13:39.153
And now, we will present the money
in reverse alphabetical order.

13:39.361 --> 13:43.782
Will Mr. Zoltan Zorba
please step forward?

13:43.991 --> 13:46.368
That's great, go ahead.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.954
Go on, get up there.

13:54.460 --> 13:56.628
Looks like it's going smoothly, Alfred.

14:05.429 --> 14:08.849
Hey. What are you trying to pull here?

14:09.058 --> 14:10.768
This bill is counterfeit!

14:11.977 --> 14:13.729
They're trying to hoodwink us!

14:13.937 --> 14:17.441
What kind of phony deal
you trying to pull?

14:17.649 --> 14:20.277
Friends, this is a fraud!

14:20.486 --> 14:24.281
They're trying to take us in!
It's counterfeit money!

14:24.490 --> 14:26.742
They say there's something rotten
in Denmark.

14:26.950 --> 14:32.873
Something's rotten in Gotham,
and it's right here, in phony money!

14:33.082 --> 14:35.959
So the Archer struck even before the fact.

14:36.168 --> 14:39.171
- I better call Batman down.
-An excellent idea, commissioner.

14:39.338 --> 14:42.341
But I've got to call the office and see
if the insurance covers this loss.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.802
I quite understand, Mr. Wayne.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.471
Chief, let me have that.

14:48.555 --> 14:54.019
Batman! Boy Wonder!
Please come down! We need you!

14:54.228 --> 14:55.938
We'll be right there, commissioner!

14:56.897 --> 15:01.068
- I'm afraid we're in for it now, Master Robin.
-Bruce will be with us in a minute, Alfred.

15:01.276 --> 15:04.488
Just as soon as he finds a place he can
change into his Batman outfit.

15:04.696 --> 15:05.906
Let's go.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.122
I thought you'd be changing by now, Bruce.

15:13.330 --> 15:16.166
There's no time for that now, Robin.
We'll have to do it another way.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.293
Just speak into this, Alfred.

15:18.502 --> 15:22.881
I've already pre-set the Bat Speech imitator
so that my own voice will come out.

15:23.090 --> 15:26.552
- Splendid. It will help hide my mustache.
-Good thinking, Alfred.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.804
You're on your own now, old chum.

15:30.639 --> 15:33.434
I can't understand
what's taking Batman so long.

15:33.642 --> 15:36.061
Usually he'd simply swing down
via his Batrope.

15:36.270 --> 15:37.604
He should be here any moment.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.692
Here they are now.

15:43.569 --> 15:45.237
Yes, commissioner. What's wrong?

15:45.446 --> 15:48.282
That infernal Archer has outwitted us.
The money is counterfeit.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.242
Holy deviltry!

15:50.451 --> 15:53.162
Say, Batman, are you all right?

15:53.328 --> 15:55.831
I have a bit of a cold,
Commissioner Gordon.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.083
I thought it might be infectious.

15:58.292 --> 16:00.669
- I don't want anyone to catch it.
-Ha-ha-ha!

16:00.878 --> 16:03.839
Just like Batman.
Always thinking of his fellow man.

16:04.047 --> 16:06.800
- What do you think happened?
-The money was switched during the night.

16:06.967 --> 16:10.679
Ten million dollars.
This is the crime of the century.

16:10.888 --> 16:14.391
Don't worry, sir.
Batman always gets his man.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.435
Say, Boy Wonder, uh...

16:16.643 --> 16:22.024
Batman looks a little, uh,
thinner these days. Is he all right?

16:22.232 --> 16:24.109
Uh, except for the cold, he's fine.

16:24.318 --> 16:28.780
Well, tell him to get some relaxation
and make sure to eat all his vegetables.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.699
I'll tell him, sir.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.245
How did I do, Master Robin?

16:35.412 --> 16:37.956
You could have fooled me.
Let's go, Alfred.

16:41.627 --> 16:44.463
- Bruce will meet us back at the Batcave.
-Right you are, sir.

16:44.671 --> 16:48.467
That swaggering churl and his guttersnipes
made good their threat.

16:48.675 --> 16:52.804
- This will probably mean my job.
-I'm sure Batman and Robin will get them.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.390
Oh, I fear those piratical desperadoes...

16:55.599 --> 16:59.394
...have already unbuckled
their swashes and fled Gotham City.

16:59.603 --> 17:04.358
- Arrivederci, Mr. Wayne.
-You're, uh... You're leaving?

17:04.566 --> 17:08.654
I hie me now to Fire Cove
for a bit of the bounding main.

17:08.862 --> 17:12.281
Allow me to offer you
my hearty handclasp.

17:12.491 --> 17:15.035
Keep in touch, won't you?

17:18.539 --> 17:22.041
You can be sure you'll hear from me.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.839
Phew! Gosh, Batman.
We're really up a tree this time.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.467
Even the Bat Crimeputer struck out.

17:30.676 --> 17:32.052
There's a large mural here.

17:32.261 --> 17:38.934
And one small piece of canvas must be
brushed in before we can get the entire picture.

17:39.601 --> 17:42.521
Let's fill it in.
The armored car was attacked at dawn...

17:42.729 --> 17:46.066
...and the only ones who knew about
the money delivery were you, I and...

17:46.275 --> 17:48.068
- Allan A. Dale.
-Correct.

17:48.277 --> 17:54.116
And the money was brand new
and in serial-number sequence.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.410
Archer wouldn't dare
try to spend the money...

17:56.577 --> 17:59.371
...because all the banks in the country
will be on the lookout for it.

17:59.538 --> 18:02.332
But where did he--
I fancy the word is stash.

18:02.541 --> 18:04.918
--All that money until the heat was removed?

18:05.127 --> 18:10.090
There's only one place in the world
where the heat would be off: Switzerland.

18:10.299 --> 18:13.635
Of course. I read about it
in my economics class.

18:13.844 --> 18:16.805
And they give you an account number
so you can remain anonymous.

18:17.014 --> 18:20.934
That's correct, Robin.
It's as plain as the masks on our faces.

18:21.143 --> 18:24.396
The Archer said we could never obtain
his number because it was...

18:24.605 --> 18:26.481
- Unlisted.
-Correct.

18:26.690 --> 18:30.193
And Allan A. Dale
went boating at Fire Cove.

18:30.402 --> 18:33.697
- Do you know where Fire Cove is?
-Well, I've spent many a summer there, sir.

18:33.905 --> 18:37.659
It's the last spot of land one sees
before going out to open water.

18:37.868 --> 18:39.911
- That leads to Europe.
-Precisely.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.874
And Commissioner Gordon said he had
the roads and the airplanes covered.

18:44.082 --> 18:47.252
But the Archer has signaled
two if by sea.

18:47.461 --> 18:50.505
To the Batboat via Batmobile.

19:07.272 --> 19:11.860
Officer! Officer! I don't understand this.

19:12.069 --> 19:14.196
How come Batman gets away
with driving so fast...

19:14.404 --> 19:16.907
...cutting around corners,
going through lights?

19:17.115 --> 19:19.951
Why, if I did that I'd be in jail
the rest of my life.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.622
Batman is a duly deputized
officer of the law, ma'am.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.249
And if he is not pursuing
a dangerous criminal...

19:26.458 --> 19:29.961
...he drives more safely than any motorist
I've ever seen.

19:30.170 --> 19:35.509
In his off-hours, he lectures on traffic safety
to driving classes all over Gotham City.

19:35.717 --> 19:39.554
No, ma'am. If ever you see
Batman driving speedily...

19:39.763 --> 19:44.434
...you can be sure that he is endangering
his life to protect yours and mine.

20:19.970 --> 20:23.765
Stand by to raise the foc's'le
and mains'le and the tops'le!

20:23.932 --> 20:26.768
And do it on the double-quick
or I'll keelhaul you!

20:26.977 --> 20:30.105
I just love that kind of talk.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.775
I think I'll go downstairs to the kitchen.

20:33.984 --> 20:36.069
Thou meanest the galley.

20:36.278 --> 20:40.073
Oh, whatever you say, Archer baby.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.203
Now, heed this: Scrape the barnacles...

20:45.412 --> 20:50.542
...pump the bilge, me scurvy crew,
then hard alee to Marseille.

20:50.751 --> 20:54.671
- Mr. Archer?
-Thou speakest?

20:54.880 --> 20:57.674
I'm getting seasick already.

20:58.425 --> 21:01.219
And we've not yet left port.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.017
You'll all be more than seasick
by the time we get through with you.

21:07.225 --> 21:10.020
Avast, me hearties. Draw thy bows.

21:10.729 --> 21:12.564
Quick, Robin, the Batshield.

21:13.482 --> 21:18.278
Fire one, fire two! Abandon boat.

21:18.487 --> 21:20.447
Take to the sword.

21:20.655 --> 21:24.284
Don't let them get away, fellows.
Slice them into small pieces.

21:24.493 --> 21:27.162
By thunder,
thee will walk the plank yet.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.872
Holy Blackbeard!

21:29.080 --> 21:32.459
Carve them up, swabbies,
or thee will all hang from the yardarm.

21:36.630 --> 21:38.089
Hey, you guys.

21:44.137 --> 21:47.933
I doff my cowl to you, Maid Marilyn.

22:30.308 --> 22:32.102
Fair is fair.

22:57.168 --> 22:59.796
<i>Et</i> tu, Brute. Ugh!

23:09.264 --> 23:12.475
Not bad, Dick. Let me give it try.

23:19.024 --> 23:21.693
Well done, sir.
And you too, Master Dick.

23:21.902 --> 23:25.864
But if I may, I'd like to show you
how we use to do it in merry old England.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.408
We could use a few pointers, Alfred.

23:28.617 --> 23:31.328
And now, Master Dick,
if you'll do the honors...

23:31.536 --> 23:35.498
...I'll show you that my nickname
of William Tell was no jest.

23:35.665 --> 23:37.584
Uh, I'd rather not, Alfred.

23:37.751 --> 23:40.420
- Not that I don't trust you or anything.
-Oh.

23:40.629 --> 23:44.716
Dick is right, Alfred. We shouldn't take
any unnecessary chances.

23:44.925 --> 23:48.470
- Oh, very well, sir.
-Here, I'll put it on the target for you.

23:48.678 --> 23:52.724
Oh, thank you, Master Dick. Yes.
You must be very careful.

23:52.933 --> 23:55.226
Draw the bow back very, very slowly...

23:55.435 --> 23:59.773
...until you reach the desired degree of tension
on your bowstring. Hmm'?

24:00.690 --> 24:03.193
- And then sight the target...
- Okay.

24:03.401 --> 24:08.281
...in this is manner and release
very smoothly like this.

24:10.492 --> 24:13.995
- Right between the eyes!
-You were saying?

24:14.162 --> 24:19.084
Heh. I do believe I forgot
to dust the Batcave, sir.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.961
Yes. Heh.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.213
If you'll excuse me.
