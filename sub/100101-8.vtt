00:00.550 --> 00:03.320
The House Judiciary Committee
this week will begin its

00:03.320 --> 00:04.284
impeachment inquiry.

00:04.284 --> 00:05.870
First Daughter Stephanie McCord

00:05.890 --> 00:08.029
will testify today
in an open hearing,

00:08.060 --> 00:10.340
followed by First
Gentleman Henry McCord.

00:10.360 --> 00:12.302
Here to offer us an inside view

00:12.302 --> 00:14.986
is Capitol Hill
correspondent Priya Khatri.

00:15.031 --> 00:17.288
Priya, why is the House
investigation beginning

00:17.297 --> 00:18.800
with the president's family members?

00:18.826 --> 00:21.831
Normally, a president
would invoke executive privilege

00:21.831 --> 00:23.573
to protect anyone in her family

00:23.573 --> 00:25.650
or administration
from testifying, but...

00:25.680 --> 00:28.790
this is an unusual presidency
in many ways.

00:28.810 --> 00:31.333
Now, the president
has always maintained

00:31.342 --> 00:34.044
she had nothing to do with
the Iran government's hacking

00:34.044 --> 00:36.257
and leaking of
her opponent's private records

00:36.257 --> 00:37.660
during the campaign.

00:37.690 --> 00:40.462
But with the Senate
Intelligence Report broadening

00:40.462 --> 00:43.306
the investigation into
corruption and obstruction,

00:43.315 --> 00:46.675
these hearings can go
in any number of directions.

00:46.844 --> 00:48.640
Want to do some cardio with me?

00:48.670 --> 00:50.240
Get out of your head?

00:50.270 --> 00:53.410
I have to go over my WTO remarks.

00:53.440 --> 00:55.410
Did you get any sleep last night?

00:55.440 --> 00:57.180
A little.

00:57.210 --> 00:59.990
Kept thinking
about that first summer.

01:00.010 --> 01:02.320
Stevie at horse camp.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.019
Poor kiddo.

01:05.050 --> 01:06.906
So homesick.

01:07.050 --> 01:09.288
Why didn't I just let her come home?

01:09.324 --> 01:10.630
You said it would help her

01:10.650 --> 01:12.470
build character, and you were right.

01:12.951 --> 01:16.370
Are we crazy,
throwing her in with the sharks?

01:16.390 --> 01:18.737
Let's just hope Olivia's right

01:18.746 --> 01:20.840
and it's not a circus
like the Senate hearings.

01:20.860 --> 01:25.180
Just a House impeachment trial
on national television.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.210
We got nothing to fear.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.980
Except the sharks.

01:29.010 --> 01:31.720
Good thing we're all fast swimmers.

01:32.580 --> 01:33.830
Hmm.

01:36.050 --> 01:37.360
It is a kick-ass opening statement.

01:37.380 --> 01:39.244
And I'm not just saying that
'cause I did a pass on it.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.315
Yeah, well, let's hope it's enough

01:41.315 --> 01:43.920
to take campaign finance
violations off the table.

01:43.928 --> 01:45.662
If there's anything I can do

01:45.662 --> 01:48.071
to clear up
the Martha's Vineyard mishap...

01:48.080 --> 01:50.000
You say "mishap," I say "gift."

01:50.008 --> 01:51.288
The more they go after that mirage,

01:51.288 --> 01:52.924
the more we know they
don't have anything real.

01:52.933 --> 01:54.260
Well, let's not get cocky.

01:54.260 --> 01:55.404
Hanson may have given

01:55.404 --> 01:57.970
the House a bunch of
trumped-up charges to work with,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.275
but the House Chair
still has to litigate them all.

02:00.293 --> 02:02.062
Canning is a tough prosecutor and

02:02.062 --> 02:04.310
- he is not our friend.
- You'll forgive me

02:04.311 --> 02:06.110
if I'm confident I won't be convicted

02:06.115 --> 02:07.208
of murdering a state senator.

02:07.253 --> 02:10.044
Well, no, you put enough doubt
in the public's mind about it,

02:10.070 --> 02:12.450
- and we're all out of a job.
- With Heeney

02:12.480 --> 02:14.986
on the House Committee,
we've got a solid defender.

02:14.995 --> 02:16.690
And the markets are
a little wobbly this morning,

02:16.710 --> 02:18.290
but overall the economy's good.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.830
Your approval ratings are holding.

02:19.850 --> 02:21.706
Why are the markets wobbly?

02:21.742 --> 02:24.160
Eli Volk disappeared
during a trip to Moscow.

02:24.190 --> 02:26.470
The Technoflux IPO
was supposed to be Wednesday,

02:26.490 --> 02:28.600
- so it's got everyone rattled.
- As long as

02:28.630 --> 02:31.140
they find him in time to write
us another campaign cheque.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.870
What? Like no one else
was thinking that?

02:33.900 --> 02:35.084
No, just you.

02:35.146 --> 02:36.610
How does a...

02:36.630 --> 02:39.920
world-famous billionaire
just disappear?

02:39.946 --> 02:40.995
We'll be covering that

02:41.004 --> 02:43.180
- in your intelligence briefing.
- Knowing Volk,

02:43.210 --> 02:44.986
he was probably
on some peyote vision quest.

02:45.004 --> 02:48.590
I'm going to just grab something
I left in the office.

02:49.004 --> 02:50.711
Hey, Mum.

02:51.150 --> 02:55.030
That lady in charge on The
Great British Baking Show.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.060
Mary Berry?

02:56.090 --> 02:57.564
I have decided

02:57.591 --> 03:00.657
she's my ideal role model
for Leading While Female.

03:00.720 --> 03:01.537
Yes!

03:01.564 --> 03:04.737
Right? Always had a kind word,

03:04.746 --> 03:07.031
even when the technical
challenge was a disaster,

03:07.031 --> 03:08.010
and kept

03:08.030 --> 03:10.410
Paul Hollywood in line with a look.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.580
Impeccable blazers.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.968
She should run for office.

03:12.995 --> 03:15.680
No! We need her right where she is.

03:15.710 --> 03:18.120
Lot of Americans might say
the same about you.

03:18.140 --> 03:20.050
- So listen...
- I know.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.306
I'll be fine, Mum.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.591
This isn't horse camp, Stevie.

03:23.608 --> 03:25.590
If you don't want to do this...

03:25.620 --> 03:26.790
I got it.

03:26.820 --> 03:28.060
I'm ready.

03:28.090 --> 03:30.330
You're my brave girl, you know that?

03:30.350 --> 03:33.070
You, me and Mary Berry.

03:33.090 --> 03:34.500
See you after?

03:34.530 --> 03:36.540
You bet.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.248
Two days ago,

03:40.248 --> 03:44.810
Eli Volk, the aerospace engineer
and CEO of Technoflux,

03:44.840 --> 03:46.408
disappeared in Moscow

03:46.408 --> 03:49.413
while on tour to promote Technoflux's

03:49.413 --> 03:50.791
initial public offering.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.480
How do you disappear
in a surveillance state?

03:52.488 --> 03:56.862
He went to a private evening at
his friend's restaurant, and

03:56.897 --> 03:59.460
his security detail lost track of him.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.368
- Max?
- There's no evidence yet

04:01.368 --> 04:03.075
on any closed-circuit we can access,

04:03.075 --> 04:04.960
and no signals to any of his contacts.

04:04.968 --> 04:06.675
What are the working theories?

04:06.711 --> 04:08.053
Could be a mob hit,

04:08.088 --> 04:12.410
some rival corporation
trying to thwart the IPO,

04:12.430 --> 04:14.480
or it was state-ordered.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.221
We're working back channels

04:16.221 --> 04:17.528
to see if there's anything

04:17.536 --> 04:19.786
behind the Kremlin's public denials.

04:19.786 --> 04:21.803
- Sorry to interrupt.
Ma'am, it's time.  - Oh.

04:21.857 --> 04:22.568
The president would like

04:22.568 --> 04:25.128
to watch her daughter's
testimony before the House.

04:25.128 --> 04:27.662
We'll, review
the rest of the PDB privately.

04:27.671 --> 04:29.060
Thank you, everyone.

04:31.075 --> 04:33.324
Members of the Committee,

04:33.377 --> 04:36.930
we have before us charges
against a sitting president,

04:36.950 --> 04:40.530
members of her administration,
campaign staff and family,

04:40.560 --> 04:42.970
which, if shown to be true,

04:42.990 --> 04:46.510
pose a threat to the very heart
of our constitutional democracy.

04:46.530 --> 04:49.662
We are united as Americans
by our unwavering faith

04:49.662 --> 04:52.350
in the integrity of our elections.

04:52.370 --> 04:54.350
To thwart the voice of the people

04:54.370 --> 04:56.897
by manipulating
ill-gotten information

04:56.906 --> 05:00.720
provided by a foreign enemy is
an assault no one in this room,

05:00.750 --> 05:02.360
nay, this country,

05:02.380 --> 05:04.490
could or should ever tolerate.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.460
Ms McCord,

05:06.480 --> 05:08.488
not only is your
mother's reputation

05:08.480 --> 05:11.270
as an elected official
at stake here today,

05:11.290 --> 05:13.730
but the soul
of your country is as well.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.608
I would ask you to shine

05:15.600 --> 05:18.540
a clear and unwavering light
upon all that you know

05:18.560 --> 05:21.380
and stand before us today
as a citizen first.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.380
The chair now recognises

05:23.400 --> 05:24.817
ranking representative member Heeney

05:24.826 --> 05:25.626
for his opening statement.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.720
Let's see that right hook, Heeney.

05:28.337 --> 05:30.880
Good afternoon,
members of the Committee.

05:30.910 --> 05:32.942
Thank you for your testimony,
Ms McCord.

05:32.977 --> 05:34.350
We are here today to find out

05:34.355 --> 05:36.124
the truth, the truth of what happened

05:36.124 --> 05:38.933
between candidate McCord
and the government of Iran

05:38.942 --> 05:41.280
in the run-up
to the presidential election.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.230
We're also here to investigate

05:43.250 --> 05:46.088
all claims of obstruction of justice

05:46.097 --> 05:49.140
and campaign finance malfeasance.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.204
Ms McCord, you do understand
that it is your duty

05:52.213 --> 05:54.222
to answer all of our questions
to the very best

05:54.222 --> 05:56.204
- of your ability...
- Is he hungover?

05:56.204 --> 05:57.950
That's not good.

05:57.970 --> 05:59.822
Sorry to interrupt. I have INR.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.111
They said it's urgent.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.450
...thank you,
members of the Committee.

06:03.470 --> 06:04.915
...that the testimony
you're about to give

06:04.915 --> 06:06.120
is true and correct

06:06.140 --> 06:06.995
to the best of your knowledge,

06:07.004 --> 06:09.031
information and belief,
so help you God?

06:09.057 --> 06:10.915
- I do.
- INR just got a hit

06:10.915 --> 06:14.337
on Eli Volk in Moscow when
his phone briefly went live.

06:14.408 --> 06:15.386
And?

06:15.537 --> 06:18.710
Seems he's in the Iranian embassy.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.906
Iran captured Eli Volk?

06:22.977 --> 06:24.684
Looks like they're trying
to even the score

06:24.693 --> 06:26.773
for the capture
of Reza Mousavi in Lebanon.

06:26.808 --> 06:28.915
Iran already hacked a German bank

06:28.915 --> 06:30.693
and crashed an oil tanker.

06:30.693 --> 06:33.150
- The score was even.
- Well, not while

06:33.170 --> 06:35.950
we've got their Quds commander
in detention.

06:35.970 --> 06:37.790
How do you want to answer?

06:38.684 --> 06:40.755
Blake? First I want to find out

06:40.755 --> 06:42.888
how much Russia knew about this.

06:42.942 --> 06:45.590
I need President Salnikov
right away, please.

06:45.620 --> 06:46.791
Yes, ma'am.

06:48.560 --> 06:51.244
Well, at least the press can't
say I was colluding with Iran

06:51.244 --> 06:53.226
- on this one.
- Don't be so sure.

06:53.244 --> 06:57.240
Which means more headlines about
Iran at the worst possible time.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:08.924 --> 07:13.493
Good afternoon.
What began as an inquiry

07:13.502 --> 07:16.660
into the alleged conspiracy
by the McCord campaign

07:16.680 --> 07:18.530
to collude with Iran,

07:18.550 --> 07:20.230
under Senator Hanson's

07:20.250 --> 07:22.453
Senate Intelligence Committee
investigation,

07:22.471 --> 07:25.270
widened to include questions

07:25.290 --> 07:28.053
wholly unrelated to that subject.

07:28.106 --> 07:31.840
This is simply the latest
partisan attempt by Congress

07:31.860 --> 07:35.262
to destroy a duly elected president.

07:35.324 --> 07:37.777
The Justice Department failed to find

07:37.786 --> 07:41.520
any evidence
of a campaign finance violation.

07:41.540 --> 07:42.980
So,

07:43.010 --> 07:45.330
why am I here?

07:45.964 --> 07:49.060
It can't be to offer new evidence

07:49.080 --> 07:51.430
of something the members
of this committee

07:51.450 --> 07:54.370
are fully aware never happened.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.431
It can only be for one purpose:

07:57.431 --> 08:01.640
to twist the facts and
wilfully mislead the public.

08:01.660 --> 08:04.266
When my mother was first chosen

08:04.266 --> 08:06.346
to serve as secretary of state,

08:06.355 --> 08:07.751
I dropped out of college,

08:07.760 --> 08:10.310
because being in the public eye

08:10.340 --> 08:12.080
made me want to disappear.

08:12.106 --> 08:15.220
Today, I welcome sitting before you,

08:15.240 --> 08:17.333
sweating through this jacket,

08:17.333 --> 08:19.857
so the American people can see
that my mother

08:19.857 --> 08:22.260
is exactly the woman
that they elected:

08:22.280 --> 08:24.930
a supreme patriot

08:24.950 --> 08:27.400
and a tireless public servant.

08:27.420 --> 08:29.500
Thank you.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.520
Thank you for that
statement, Ms McCord.

08:31.555 --> 08:33.794
I for one agree that the charge

08:33.794 --> 08:36.506
of campaign finance violations
has been fully adjudicated,

08:36.515 --> 08:39.323
and I have no further
questions on that matter.

08:39.422 --> 08:41.376
I would like to turn our attention now

08:41.376 --> 08:43.710
to your employment
by the Dalton administration.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.208
You were hired as an intern

08:45.208 --> 08:47.262
to Chief of Staff Russell
Jackson, is that correct?

08:47.324 --> 08:49.173
- Yes.
- And you began your tenure

08:49.182 --> 08:50.897
after your mother had assumed her role

08:50.897 --> 08:52.350
as secretary of state,
is that correct?

08:52.380 --> 08:53.890
That's correct.

08:53.910 --> 08:56.311
An internship with the
White House chief of staff

08:56.311 --> 08:58.346
is a coveted job.

08:58.373 --> 08:59.893
Would you say you were engaged

08:59.893 --> 09:02.515
solely on the basis
of your qualifications?

09:07.697 --> 09:10.764
Mr Jackson was familiar
with my qualifications,

09:10.773 --> 09:13.368
because I had approached him
for a letter of recommendation

09:13.368 --> 09:14.210
for law school.

09:14.230 --> 09:17.671
Meaning you were
the best candidate for the job.

09:17.697 --> 09:20.420
All I can say is that I was hired.

09:20.440 --> 09:25.368
The Committee is in,
receipt of five resumes

09:25.368 --> 09:27.591
under consideration by Mr Jackson

09:27.591 --> 09:28.560
at the time of your hire.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.460
One candidate was a Rhodes scholar.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.360
Were you a Rhodes scholar?

09:32.380 --> 09:33.930
- Nope.
- Another candidate

09:33.950 --> 09:36.030
was a Harvard Law School
graduate who had

09:36.050 --> 09:37.475
clerked for Justice Breyer.

09:37.502 --> 09:40.070
At the time of your hire,
had you attended law school?

09:40.090 --> 09:41.500
No, but...

09:41.530 --> 09:44.070
- Third candidate was...
- Excuse me, Congressman, if...

09:44.100 --> 09:46.210
the point you're making
is that there were

09:46.230 --> 09:49.510
other qualified candidates,
Ms McCord doesn't dispute that.

09:49.530 --> 09:51.250
The point I'm making
is that President McCord

09:51.270 --> 09:53.893
has a long history
of abusing privilege.

09:53.911 --> 09:56.280
A prime example being
the pressure she brought to bear

09:56.310 --> 09:58.520
on Mr Jackson to hire her daughter.

09:58.540 --> 10:00.120
There was no pressure.

10:00.150 --> 10:02.613
If Mr Jackson favored me in any way,

10:02.622 --> 10:05.573
it may be because I happened
to be in his office

10:05.573 --> 10:08.826
when he suffered a heart attack,
and I got him critical care.

10:08.871 --> 10:10.968
If that is sufficient

10:10.977 --> 10:13.351
to outweigh the qualifications
of a Rhodes scholar

10:13.351 --> 10:15.875
is for Mr Jackson to answer, not me.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.370
Something we
can certainly explore further.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.791
- Now let's move on.
- That's how you do it.

10:20.808 --> 10:23.217
Well, glad my heart attack
worked to her advantage.

10:23.217 --> 10:24.710
I have

10:24.740 --> 10:25.750
President Salnikov, ma'am.

10:25.770 --> 10:26.780
Ms McCord,

10:26.810 --> 10:28.290
we've spent much of this afternoon...

10:31.210 --> 10:33.190
Good evening, Madam President.

10:33.210 --> 10:34.490
I'm sorry

10:34.510 --> 10:36.444
to disturb you so late, Mr President.

10:36.444 --> 10:39.644
We've just gotten news
on the capture of Eli Volk.

10:39.653 --> 10:41.777
Our intel shows he's being held

10:41.777 --> 10:44.240
in the Iranian embassy in Moscow.

10:44.293 --> 10:45.740
That is surprising.

10:46.630 --> 10:48.844
Yes, and I'm sure

10:48.844 --> 10:52.510
you agree this development
is appalling and unacceptable.

10:52.530 --> 10:54.820
Have you contacted the embassy?

10:55.870 --> 10:59.210
Well, in light of recent events,
Iran isn't

10:59.240 --> 11:00.920
taking our calls at the moment.

11:00.940 --> 11:03.697
Any information or help you can offer

11:03.697 --> 11:06.906
to get our citizen home
would be most appreciated.

11:06.968 --> 11:08.462
We will do everything we can.

11:08.471 --> 11:11.660
As you know, the embassy
is not under our jurisdiction.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.730
I'm aware of that, Mr President.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.848
And I'm sure you're aware

11:15.848 --> 11:18.231
that Mr Volk's illegal kidnapping

11:18.231 --> 11:19.937
is affecting the global market,

11:19.946 --> 11:23.540
which impacts your economy and ours.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.813
It seems to me, Madam President,

11:25.813 --> 11:28.071
the best way
to stabilise the situation is

11:28.071 --> 11:29.710
to answer Iran directly

11:29.730 --> 11:32.026
for your own provocations.

11:32.071 --> 11:34.450
Thank you for your counsel.

11:34.470 --> 11:36.250
Let me add that

11:36.270 --> 11:39.591
if Mr Volk steps one foot
out of the embassy,

11:39.591 --> 11:42.990
we'll consider his well-being
your direct responsibility.

11:43.010 --> 11:47.800
If anything were to prevent
his swift and safe return home,

11:47.820 --> 11:49.800
there would be grave consequences.

11:49.820 --> 11:51.777
We are great admirers of Mr Volk

11:51.777 --> 11:53.470
and stand by ready to help.

11:53.490 --> 11:55.700
Good night, Madam President.

11:55.730 --> 11:59.831
Did he just explain to us
how embassies work?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.746
If he's stonewalling,
I-I'm going to need evidence

12:02.746 --> 12:04.026
of Russia's involvement.

12:04.062 --> 12:06.986
Reach out to the DNI,
have them see if there are

12:06.986 --> 12:09.244
any recent deals
between Russia and Iran,

12:09.253 --> 12:12.915
anything that even looks
like a quid pro quo.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.190
Ma'am, it's time for the WTO.

12:14.210 --> 12:15.520
I'll reach out to Ephraim.

12:15.550 --> 12:17.700
Yeah, OK.

12:19.250 --> 12:21.111
How's she doing?

12:21.250 --> 12:23.330
You know like in Wonder Woman,

12:23.360 --> 12:26.097
when she fends off bullets
with her bracelets?

12:26.320 --> 12:28.240
It's like that.

12:30.230 --> 12:32.810
Ms McCord, how did you learn
about your mother's role

12:32.817 --> 12:36.213
in the torture and murder
of Iraqi detainees?

12:38.500 --> 12:41.742
I'm sorry. Is my mother on trial
for the actions

12:41.742 --> 12:43.750
of the U.S. government
during the war on terror?

12:43.780 --> 12:47.150
I have a text message that you sent

12:47.180 --> 12:49.466
seven years ago.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.666
"Don't ask my mum.

12:50.666 --> 12:52.533
"She totally lied about Iraq

12:52.533 --> 12:54.008
for my entire childhood."

12:54.053 --> 12:55.360
I was not aware

12:55.368 --> 12:56.730
that there was a House subpoena

12:56.760 --> 12:58.880
on Ms McCord's private messages.

12:58.906 --> 13:01.010
This was offered by the recipient.

13:03.230 --> 13:06.622
Well, that was a seven-year-old
comment taken out of context.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.044
There had been a recent bombing,

13:08.044 --> 13:10.915
and I think I was on
my way to a peace rally.

13:11.031 --> 13:13.040
Did she or didn't she
lie to you about Iraq?

13:13.066 --> 13:14.231
That's...

13:14.471 --> 13:17.075
If she had told me the truth,

13:17.075 --> 13:18.728
you would be raking her over the coals

13:18.720 --> 13:20.391
for revealing classified information.

13:20.391 --> 13:22.408
- So you admit she's a liar?
- Ms McCord

13:22.408 --> 13:24.951
is not here to discuss
her personal conversations

13:24.951 --> 13:27.520
with her mother or her
friends that have no bearing

13:27.537 --> 13:30.577
on the president's duties
or this committee's charter.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.070
Why don't I move on
to my next area of inquiry?

13:33.090 --> 13:34.737
- Thank you.
- I want to ask you

13:34.737 --> 13:38.284
about your relationship
with Dmitri Petrov.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.740
Yes.

13:40.770 --> 13:42.440
He was your date

13:42.470 --> 13:44.240
to the White House
Correspondents' Dinner.

13:44.293 --> 13:45.210
Is that correct?

13:45.240 --> 13:46.480
Yes.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.480
How did you first meet Mr Petrov?

13:48.510 --> 13:51.173
He was my father's student
at the War College.

13:51.217 --> 13:52.391
Were you aware at the time that

13:52.391 --> 13:54.290
Mr Petrov was an intelligence asset

13:54.310 --> 13:55.671
under your father's supervision?

13:55.760 --> 13:56.660
No.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.190
Were you aware that before you met

13:58.220 --> 14:00.490
Mr Petrov, he was
living in Phoenix, Arizona

14:00.520 --> 14:01.730
under a pseudonym

14:01.750 --> 14:04.284
where he was arrested for assault?

14:04.408 --> 14:06.270
I was not.

14:06.290 --> 14:08.142
Were you aware
that Mr Petrov was treated

14:08.142 --> 14:11.780
for opiate addiction
shortly before you first met?

14:12.302 --> 14:14.053
No, I wasn't.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.471
I didn't know the opiate...

14:16.560 --> 14:17.608
No.

14:17.626 --> 14:19.137
So your father allowed you to

14:19.137 --> 14:21.720
engage in a relationship
with a violent opiate addict

14:21.740 --> 14:24.560
who was, at the time,
a target of Russian assassins?

14:24.577 --> 14:25.950
- It's completely ridiculous.
- Mr Canning,

14:25.955 --> 14:27.422
this line of questioning
has nothing to do with

14:27.422 --> 14:29.220
- an impeachment inquiry.
- It has everything

14:29.250 --> 14:31.030
to do with President McCord's character,

14:31.050 --> 14:32.630
which is fundamental to this inquiry.

14:32.650 --> 14:34.560
Dmitri Petrov's efforts influenced

14:34.590 --> 14:36.300
America's foreign policy agenda,

14:36.320 --> 14:38.030
directly benefiting Elizabeth McCord

14:38.060 --> 14:40.940
at a time when she was plotting
her own political future.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.013
The McCords wanted
to keep him on a leash

14:43.022 --> 14:44.210
in case they needed him again.

14:44.230 --> 14:45.910
And in blatant disregard of protocol,

14:45.930 --> 14:47.297
they deployed their own daughter

14:47.297 --> 14:49.084
to aid in their own
self-serving mission.

14:49.084 --> 14:51.688
- That is completely outrageous.
- Point of order.

14:51.688 --> 14:53.910
You have exceeded your
time, Mr Chairman.

14:53.940 --> 14:55.780
Aah! Put me out of my misery.

14:55.810 --> 14:58.346
Heeney better put him in a box.

14:58.346 --> 15:00.550
Are you currently employed,
Ms McCord?

15:00.580 --> 15:04.890
Yes, I am a project manager at
the Human Amnesty Association.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.890
And I just want to say for one,

15:06.920 --> 15:09.200
I am very grateful

15:09.200 --> 15:12.170
for the vital humanitarian
work that you're doing there.

15:12.190 --> 15:13.270
Thank you.

15:13.290 --> 15:14.248
And can I just ask,

15:14.248 --> 15:16.302
and sorry if this is
a little off topic, but

15:16.302 --> 15:17.440
how did your status

15:17.460 --> 15:20.640
as First Daughter help
you get this position?

15:20.670 --> 15:22.140
It didn't.

15:22.170 --> 15:24.150
I was actually told

15:24.170 --> 15:26.510
that my security requirements
were a concern.

15:26.540 --> 15:29.146
But I like to think that my passion

15:29.146 --> 15:31.866
for the work and my degree
in social justice law

15:31.866 --> 15:33.920
helped mitigate those challenges.

15:33.950 --> 15:35.920
Meaning you're not in the habit

15:35.920 --> 15:37.360
of using your personal connections

15:37.368 --> 15:38.660
for career advancement?

15:38.680 --> 15:39.590
No, I'm not.

15:39.620 --> 15:41.048
Take that, nepotism.

15:41.084 --> 15:42.186
Thank you.

15:42.222 --> 15:44.480
I'll yield the rest of my time
to the chairman.

15:44.497 --> 15:45.288
Wait. What?

15:45.306 --> 15:47.270
What is he...? 
Don't yield!

15:47.290 --> 15:49.640
I'd like to go back to Mr Petrov.

15:49.660 --> 15:51.470
Because it seems to me that

15:51.500 --> 15:53.813
the American public deserves
to know the truth

15:53.813 --> 15:57.040
of your parents' involvement in
this relationship.

15:57.048 --> 15:59.048
Congressman, my
parents were not involved

15:59.048 --> 16:00.675
- in my relationship.
- So you were not complicit

16:00.675 --> 16:02.550
in your parents' manipulation
of Dmitri Petrov?

16:02.570 --> 16:03.857
They deceived you, as well?

16:03.866 --> 16:05.320
- That's... that...
- Mr Canning.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.220
- Mr Canning? This isn't croquet!
- That's not...

16:07.250 --> 16:08.560
- What the hell is he afraid of?
- They couldn't have manipulated

16:08.580 --> 16:10.320
Mr Petrov because they didn't know

16:10.320 --> 16:11.937
that I was seeing him at first.

16:11.973 --> 16:13.377
Huh.

16:13.750 --> 16:17.100
So, you've come here
to defend your mother,

16:17.120 --> 16:20.773
but it turns out that you are
just as deceitful as she is.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.195
Wha...?

16:22.293 --> 16:25.528
I'm sorry. That's not at all accurate.

16:25.528 --> 16:27.884
Given this witness's
admitted disregard

16:27.884 --> 16:28.910
for the truth, I don't think

16:28.930 --> 16:31.288
further questioning would be fruitful.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.884
You're excused.

16:45.520 --> 16:48.640
Guys, I am so sorry.

16:48.648 --> 16:50.088
- No. What? Are you kidding?
- What? No. Are you kidding?

16:50.090 --> 16:51.270
We're sorry. 
I just...

16:51.290 --> 16:52.871
That never should
have happened, Stevie...

16:52.871 --> 16:54.570
He started hammering me
with all these questions.

16:54.577 --> 16:56.370
- I didn't know about Dmitri...
- Listen. No. I...

16:56.390 --> 16:58.270
- It never should have happened.
- It's my fault. I should have told you

16:58.275 --> 16:59.570
- about Dmitri's history.
- No, it is not. You...

16:59.573 --> 17:01.810
- But I...
- It is not your fault. I...

17:01.830 --> 17:03.780
You didn't even know
that we were dating.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.450
That is totally on me.

17:05.470 --> 17:09.390
Stevie, none of this
is on you, sweetheart.

17:09.400 --> 17:12.020
You were so brave and so good.

17:14.497 --> 17:17.742
Yesterday turned an
internship and a boyfriend

17:17.742 --> 17:20.382
into a bloodbath we'll be
mopping up for months.

17:20.382 --> 17:22.560
We're not throwing another
one of you to the lions.

17:22.579 --> 17:25.208
I'm already under subpoena.
I'm not backing out.

17:25.217 --> 17:28.115
We'd be well within our rights
to claim spousal privilege.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.840
And let it seem like we're in retreat?

17:29.890 --> 17:32.666
No. That would confirm every lie
they threw out there yesterday.

17:32.666 --> 17:34.053
I still can't even follow
what Canning thought

17:34.053 --> 17:35.022
he was trying to build.

17:35.022 --> 17:38.053
Somehow your daughter dating
a Russian asset helped you

17:38.062 --> 17:39.262
shore up political power?

17:39.271 --> 17:41.020
- He was spinning.
- And Heeney

17:41.020 --> 17:42.770
was holding the yarn.

17:42.790 --> 17:44.871
So much for having an ally up there.

17:44.888 --> 17:46.500
Which is why I need to testify.

17:46.530 --> 17:47.911
I'm the one that brought Dmitri

17:47.911 --> 17:49.410
into Special Activities Division.

17:49.430 --> 17:51.540
I can vouch for his value as an asset.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.351
They are making him the question.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.853
I'm the one that can answer it.

17:54.871 --> 17:56.050
My concern is how much

17:56.070 --> 17:58.160
of this Petrov case
is still classified.

17:58.168 --> 17:59.650
Your hands will be tied.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.315
Make it a closed hearing.

18:01.342 --> 18:04.666
They smeared Stevie publicly.
I want to answer it publicly.

18:04.702 --> 18:05.790
It's the only way

18:05.810 --> 18:09.555
that we can fully answer
these insane allegations.

18:09.564 --> 18:10.977
Congress can always release

18:10.977 --> 18:13.360
a redacted transcript if there
are accusations of a cover-up.

18:13.390 --> 18:15.630
- If you think it's best.
- Can we...

18:15.660 --> 18:18.810
limit the questions
to Petrov, at least?

18:20.030 --> 18:21.288
No.

18:21.324 --> 18:23.920
We'll answer
whatever questions they have.

18:24.008 --> 18:26.622
Let the chairman know
the hearing will be closed.

18:26.622 --> 18:27.635
Thank you, everyone.

18:27.644 --> 18:29.288
That's it.

18:36.850 --> 18:38.311
I'll fix it.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.570
Hey. How are you?

18:52.590 --> 18:54.010
Good.

18:54.030 --> 18:56.426
Sorry I didn't call last night.

18:56.444 --> 18:57.164
Oh, I know.

18:57.235 --> 19:00.550
It was a crazy day.

19:00.570 --> 19:02.720
Yeah.

19:04.257 --> 19:06.960
- I was thinking about... 
- Yeah, I don't know if you...

19:06.977 --> 19:07.573
Sorry.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.715
- No, go ahead. - 
No. You.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.290
Some of the things
you heard about me,

19:15.320 --> 19:18.430
the assault charge in Phoenix,
I didn't hurt anyone.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.648
I smashed a television.
It was stupid.

19:20.737 --> 19:22.470
OK, yeah, the...

19:22.490 --> 19:23.937
Actually, the only thing
that really threw me

19:23.937 --> 19:27.910
was the addiction recovery.

19:27.930 --> 19:28.995
I know.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.980
It was pain medication
for some injuries

19:33.000 --> 19:34.480
that I suffered in Russia.

19:34.500 --> 19:37.031
Oh. OK.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.875
I just...
I dated an addict once before,

19:39.875 --> 19:41.750
and just made me wonder

19:41.780 --> 19:44.000
if it's a thing with me, or...

19:44.053 --> 19:45.590
No, it's not a thing with me.

19:45.610 --> 19:48.630
I've never done anything
since treatment. Never.

19:48.650 --> 19:50.800
OK.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.930
This is so weird.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.070
I'm sorry I keep bringing you
and your family so much trouble.

19:57.090 --> 19:59.770
Hey, can we meet up

19:59.800 --> 20:02.410
so we can talk in person?

20:02.430 --> 20:04.248
Yeah.

20:05.070 --> 20:08.110
I think I just need a little time

20:08.140 --> 20:10.290
to think things through first.

20:11.140 --> 20:12.950
Of course.

20:12.980 --> 20:14.950
But I'll call you soon, OK?

20:14.980 --> 20:16.320
OK.

20:16.350 --> 20:18.290
I'll talk to you then.

20:18.310 --> 20:20.008
OK.

20:27.790 --> 20:31.360
"USAID has prioritised emergency

20:31.360 --> 20:33.920
response programs for
vulnerable population groups..."

20:33.928 --> 20:35.724
Ma'am. Ephraim Ware.

20:35.751 --> 20:38.880
I was just forcing Russell to
get some steps in with me.

20:38.888 --> 20:42.380
Ah. You know, FDR used
to work at a desk out here.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.460
So say the White House archives.

20:45.102 --> 20:47.448
I'll let you run the country now.

20:48.382 --> 20:50.266
Ma'am, we have evidence

20:50.275 --> 20:53.173
of Russia's possible
cooperation with Iran

20:53.173 --> 20:55.484
in the capture of Eli Volk.

20:55.537 --> 20:57.160
I really didn't want
to be right about that.

20:57.190 --> 21:00.186
This is a direct transfer
from the State Bank

21:00.190 --> 21:04.370
of Iran to a private account
traced to President Salnikov.

21:04.390 --> 21:07.315
The payment appears to be
connected to a recent deal

21:07.315 --> 21:09.777
for Russia to develop
Iranian oil fields.

21:09.848 --> 21:11.080
What kind of oil deal

21:11.100 --> 21:13.310
pays directly into a
president's pocket?

21:13.340 --> 21:15.580
You have confidence
in this intelligence?

21:15.600 --> 21:18.506
Entirely. I'll also point out

21:18.524 --> 21:20.320
that the date of the transfer is

21:20.340 --> 21:23.324
less than 48 hours
after our SEAL team's

21:23.324 --> 21:25.490
capture of Reza Mousavi in Lebanon.

21:25.510 --> 21:27.404
Yeah, well, Iran didn't waste any time

21:27.404 --> 21:28.730
hatching a counterattack.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.360
Or it's a striking coincidence.

21:31.390 --> 21:32.730
Thanks, Ephraim.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.230
Ma'am.

21:34.260 --> 21:37.235
Madam President,
perhaps your own charges

21:37.235 --> 21:39.500
of collusion
with Iran have confused you.

21:39.530 --> 21:43.848
There is nothing covert in
an oil deal between two allies.

21:43.902 --> 21:47.380
This agreement with Iran was
widely reported in the press.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.711
True.

21:48.906 --> 21:53.440
What wasn't widely reported was
how much you, Mr President,

21:53.448 --> 21:55.320
were personally enriched by this deal.

21:55.340 --> 21:59.020
I-I have here records
of multiple transfers

21:59.050 --> 22:01.890
to an account we've traced
to you personally

22:01.920 --> 22:04.200
from the State Bank of Iran.

22:04.220 --> 22:08.030
All of which happened days
before Eli Volk's capture.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.670
Something I appreciated
about your predecessor

22:10.690 --> 22:13.270
was that he never spoke in innuendo.

22:13.300 --> 22:15.710
It's something wives do, not leaders.

22:15.730 --> 22:17.484
Well, I thank you, Maxim,

22:17.484 --> 22:20.550
for another lesson in statecraft.

22:20.570 --> 22:23.510
Let me be more direct, then.

22:23.540 --> 22:25.351
Either you take immediate steps

22:25.351 --> 22:27.490
to get Iran to return our citizen

22:27.510 --> 22:30.560
and avoid further conflict
with the United States,

22:30.580 --> 22:32.390
or the people of Russia will soon know

22:32.410 --> 22:34.190
how much you've personally gained

22:34.220 --> 22:37.130
at the expense of your comrades.

22:37.150 --> 22:39.730
I hope that's not too indirect.

22:39.866 --> 22:41.573
Your threats are quite clear.

22:41.617 --> 22:43.630
However, the fact remains

22:43.660 --> 22:46.240
that your citizen is being held

22:46.260 --> 22:49.470
in the sovereign territory
of the Iranian embassy.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.226
Therefore, I cannot...

22:51.244 --> 22:55.450
I'm not asking you to
violate Iran's sovereignty.

22:55.470 --> 22:58.420
I'm asking you to reach out
to your ally to arrange

22:58.440 --> 23:02.604
the secret transfer of Eli Volk
from Moscow to Tehran.

23:02.648 --> 23:05.733
And then I'd like you
to inform us immediately

23:05.733 --> 23:07.742
of the details of the flight plan.

23:07.760 --> 23:10.968
You have 12 hours
to make the arrangement.

23:12.620 --> 23:15.870
He's so right
about the direct approach.

23:15.890 --> 23:20.680
It really is more efficient.

23:21.786 --> 23:23.780
I'll reach out to Defence.

23:48.820 --> 23:49.970
We're on.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.480
Ma'am, we successfully intercepted

23:57.500 --> 23:59.440
the jet carrying Eli Volk

23:59.470 --> 24:01.608
once it left Russian air space.

24:01.733 --> 24:04.980
His plane has landed and
is on the tarmac at Incirlik.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.986
Once the hostage deplanes,
a Delta Force Team

24:06.980 --> 24:08.444
will secure the aircraft.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.220
Looks like Salnikov came through.

24:10.471 --> 24:12.120
Any contact from Iran?

24:12.150 --> 24:14.782
Nothing official.
We're trying back channels.

24:15.093 --> 24:17.370
Alpha Team, execute secure package.

24:25.991 --> 24:29.080
Switch camera view to door side.

24:30.266 --> 24:32.995
First step will be
to establish communication

24:32.995 --> 24:34.110
with the cockpit.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.213
Get proof of life on Volk.

24:36.222 --> 24:38.071
Eyes on the door.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.982
The door is opening.

24:48.782 --> 24:52.300
Send Eli Volk out of the plane now.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.324
Eli Volk...

24:56.808 --> 24:58.755
I repeat, send Eli Volk...

24:59.688 --> 25:01.770
Hey, we got a civilian in there!

25:01.800 --> 25:03.573
- Hold fire. Hold fire.
- Pull them back.

25:03.570 --> 25:04.720
Hold fire!

25:05.244 --> 25:06.540
Pop smoke and take cover.

25:06.570 --> 25:07.750
Popping smoke.

25:13.466 --> 25:15.573
They're surrounded by U.S. troops.

25:15.582 --> 25:16.791
How do they think this ends?

25:16.791 --> 25:19.288
For all we know, 
that cargo bay's full of C-4.

25:19.511 --> 25:21.200
How's our casualty?

25:21.200 --> 25:21.928
Stable.

25:21.928 --> 25:23.573
We've got him on
a medevac to Landstuhl.

25:23.991 --> 25:25.386
What about Volk?

25:25.395 --> 25:27.493
We're working on
re-establishing comms.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.066
Infrared shows that he's in there,

25:29.066 --> 25:30.577
but they've blocked
our view of the cabin.

25:30.577 --> 25:33.420
So he could be wounded
or dying for all we know.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.213
No moves until we get word on Volk.

25:36.210 --> 25:37.048
Copy that.

25:37.057 --> 25:40.760
Let's just calm this down.

25:40.780 --> 25:41.982
Ephraim.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.470
We just got SIGINT from
Syria and Southern Lebanon.

25:45.490 --> 25:47.280
Iranian proxy forces

25:47.280 --> 25:49.395
are activating on the Israeli border.

25:49.431 --> 25:52.540
Ma'am, if Hezbollah launches
their short range missiles,

25:52.560 --> 25:53.804
hundreds could be killed.

25:53.822 --> 25:56.160
It's sabre-rattling.
Shiraz doesn't want

25:56.168 --> 25:59.250
the Middle East igniting over
this any more than we do.

25:59.270 --> 26:01.080
- I'd rather not count on that.
- But...

26:01.100 --> 26:03.180
Susan's right.

26:03.210 --> 26:06.720
But we have to give Shiraz
something so he has cover.

26:07.540 --> 26:08.853
Let's get Tehran.

26:08.915 --> 26:11.220
Get us President Shiraz
as soon as possible.

26:11.250 --> 26:14.017
All due respect, ma'am, you are under

26:14.017 --> 26:16.737
an impeachment investigation
for colluding with Iran.

26:16.746 --> 26:18.746
Is this really the time
for appeasement?

26:18.773 --> 26:20.746
I'm going to lead with a stick.

26:20.773 --> 26:23.075
I just want a carrot on the end of it.

26:23.111 --> 26:25.000
I have Shiraz on the line, ma'am.

26:25.030 --> 26:26.551
Get him on the screen.

26:26.906 --> 26:30.980
Ellen, are we prepared
for a retaliatory strike?

26:31.000 --> 26:31.733
Yes, ma'am.

26:31.733 --> 26:33.644
Sixth Fleet is on standby in the Gulf.

26:33.644 --> 26:35.110
We can have F-18s

26:35.140 --> 26:37.450
over Bandar-e 'Abbas in ten minutes.

26:37.470 --> 26:40.240
Can we discuss what you're
planning to offer first?

26:40.240 --> 26:42.520
Russell, I'm trying to prevent a
shooting war in the Middle East.

26:42.550 --> 26:44.360
We can talk about how it
plays in the press later.

26:44.380 --> 26:45.530
President Shiraz.

26:45.550 --> 26:47.590
It seems we have a situation.

26:47.620 --> 26:49.930
No, you have a situation.

26:49.950 --> 26:51.400
You can resolve it by returning

26:51.420 --> 26:54.500
our citizen Reza Mousavi immediately.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.951
Let's take a beat here.

26:56.977 --> 27:01.340
You've got an American held
hostage by armed guards.

27:01.370 --> 27:04.210
We've got you surrounded
by American troops

27:04.230 --> 27:06.110
on a military base.

27:06.140 --> 27:09.555
And now you've got Hezbollah
aiming rockets at Tel Aviv.

27:09.573 --> 27:12.613
Have you asked
yourself where this ends?

27:12.657 --> 27:14.648
It ends where it began:

27:14.648 --> 27:16.490
with Iran defending itself

27:16.510 --> 27:18.830
against U.S. imperial aggression.

27:18.850 --> 27:22.230
Do you honestly think bullying
is the way to go here?

27:22.250 --> 27:25.111
Because I'll tell you
what bullying gets you, Najid.

27:25.128 --> 27:28.097
It gets you a firestorm
of Tomahawk Missiles

27:28.097 --> 27:31.040
and smart bombs annihilating
your offensive capabilities

27:31.060 --> 27:34.740
before you can even
think about responding.

27:34.770 --> 27:36.680
And then your only consolation

27:36.700 --> 27:41.102
will be a proxy war with Israel
that you cannot win.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.220
In the next 30 minutes,

27:44.240 --> 27:48.090
Eli Volk is going to
walk off that plane.

27:48.110 --> 27:52.090
No shots will be fired
on our side or yours.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.848
Your plane,

27:53.848 --> 27:57.500
and everyone on it,
will return peacefully to Iran

27:57.520 --> 28:01.510
and we'll continue our talks
about cyber attacks another day.

28:10.871 --> 28:13.733
I will bring your proposal
to the Supreme Leader

28:13.733 --> 28:15.857
for his consideration.

28:15.884 --> 28:17.644
Thank you.

28:19.342 --> 28:22.684
Well played, Madam President.

28:22.780 --> 28:25.582
Let's hope that
was enough of a carrot.

28:25.591 --> 28:27.475
It was plenty of stick.

29:28.906 --> 29:32.257
Dr McCord, six years ago,
when you worked for

29:32.257 --> 29:34.790
Defence Intelligence,
you recruited a Russian soldier

29:34.791 --> 29:37.230
named Dimitri Petrov as an agent

29:37.250 --> 29:39.130
to spy on Russia, is that correct?

29:39.160 --> 29:40.231
I did.

29:40.257 --> 29:42.088
And you did so
by providing experimental

29:42.088 --> 29:43.617
life-saving treatment to his sister,

29:43.617 --> 29:45.893
who was suffering from fibrosarcoma.

29:45.964 --> 29:48.370
Yes. And he performed
an invaluable service

29:48.373 --> 29:51.280
to the United States by
providing critical intelligence

29:51.280 --> 29:53.226
that helped prevent
a Russian invasion of Ukraine.

29:53.271 --> 29:56.595
Subsequent to Mr Petrov's
invaluable service,

29:56.595 --> 29:58.480
Russia engaged in
treaty negotiations

29:58.510 --> 30:00.490
with the United States,
which necessitated

30:00.510 --> 30:03.920
the identification and capture
of Mr Petrov, correct?

30:03.950 --> 30:06.030
I can't get into the details of that,

30:06.050 --> 30:08.648
but Mr Petrov, regrettably,

30:08.657 --> 30:11.830
was collateral damage for
the sake of national security.

30:11.860 --> 30:13.457
Yeah, but he underwent torture.

30:13.560 --> 30:14.933
Correct.

30:14.968 --> 30:17.840
Dr McCord, you personally worked

30:17.860 --> 30:20.400
to have Mr Petrov released
and repatriated

30:20.408 --> 30:22.604
- to the United States, is that correct?
- I did.

30:22.648 --> 30:24.810
Are you aware of the maxim that

30:24.840 --> 30:26.977
once an agent has been turned,

30:26.995 --> 30:29.250
he or she can be turned again?

30:29.466 --> 30:31.880
That's a gross oversimplification.

30:31.910 --> 30:33.866
Mr Petrov was a unique asset

30:33.866 --> 30:35.960
with an unparalleled knowledge base.

30:35.980 --> 30:38.060
I recruited him only after
he was fully vetted.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.493
Were you aware of his opioid addiction

30:39.493 --> 30:41.626
when you brought him on at
Special Activities Division?

30:41.720 --> 30:43.120
I learned of that later.

30:43.137 --> 30:46.364
So your vetting
was less than thorough.

30:46.373 --> 30:49.040
Excuse me, Congressman,
I once again fail to see

30:49.060 --> 30:51.164
how these questions
have anything to do

30:51.164 --> 30:52.410
with President McCord.

30:52.430 --> 30:54.817
I'm establishing that connection
right now, Counsellor.

30:54.862 --> 30:56.746
Dr McCord, after your wife became

30:56.746 --> 30:58.933
Secretary of State,
she installed you as

30:58.933 --> 31:01.480
President Dalton's
ethics advisor, didn't she?

31:01.688 --> 31:02.980
She did not.

31:03.010 --> 31:05.644
President Dalton
independently sought me out

31:05.644 --> 31:07.333
for my expertise in the field.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.062
How many previous presidents
had sought you out?

31:10.097 --> 31:11.290
I was a member of the faculty

31:11.310 --> 31:13.297
at the National War College,
a qualification

31:13.297 --> 31:16.017
that was sought out
by previous administrations.

31:16.053 --> 31:17.777
But not you personally.

31:17.804 --> 31:20.870
And your job as ethics advisor
in your wife's administration,

31:20.890 --> 31:23.070
was that based on merit?

31:23.090 --> 31:27.070
Congressman, if you're going
to slander my family,

31:27.075 --> 31:29.440
please have the courage
to say what you mean.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.940
You knew years ago your wife
was going to run for president.

31:31.970 --> 31:33.422
That is completely false.

31:33.422 --> 31:34.850
So to burnish her credentials,

31:34.870 --> 31:37.111
you identified an unstable addict

31:37.120 --> 31:39.550
and manipulated him
to put his life in danger

31:39.580 --> 31:41.890
to further your wife's
diplomatic agenda.

31:41.910 --> 31:42.862
That's pure fiction.

31:42.862 --> 31:44.302
And after Russia captured him,

31:44.302 --> 31:46.830
no doubt compelling him
to reveal American secrets,

31:46.850 --> 31:49.400
you had the wisdom to give this addict

31:49.420 --> 31:51.697
a classified job as a payoff.

31:51.706 --> 31:53.940
Do you have evidence of
any of these allegations?

31:53.940 --> 31:55.640
Finally, to sweeten
the deal, you set him up

31:55.660 --> 31:56.693
with your own daughter.

31:56.693 --> 31:58.808
All so President McCord
could have a man

31:58.808 --> 32:01.982
on retainer who owed
the McCords his life.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.493
And his sister's life.

32:03.591 --> 32:06.120
And if ethical questions were
raised about his retention,

32:06.140 --> 32:08.590
about anything your
wife wanted to do, well,

32:08.610 --> 32:11.777
she had the White House ethics
advisor to brush those aside.

32:11.786 --> 32:15.057
Congressman, if you were a
freshman in my ethics class,

32:15.066 --> 32:16.430
I would give you an "F."

32:16.450 --> 32:18.648
You have no logic...

32:18.648 --> 32:20.853
- Really, Professor, because I think...
- May I finish?

32:20.888 --> 32:23.226
Or is that how this works?

32:23.226 --> 32:25.982
You get to make up whatever you
want and I don't get to answer?

32:27.111 --> 32:28.524
Please.

32:28.720 --> 32:32.240
Most of us think of ethics
as the rules of moral behaviour.

32:32.257 --> 32:33.280
You are what you do.

32:33.288 --> 32:35.555
But I teach a more
theological approach

32:35.555 --> 32:37.724
called virtue ethics.

32:37.742 --> 32:40.284
Virtue ethics says that who we are

32:40.284 --> 32:42.533
is not determined
by the actions we take,

32:42.533 --> 32:44.008
but why we take them.

32:44.008 --> 32:46.408
So you can't just spin out
some wild theory based on

32:46.400 --> 32:48.791
a few cherry-picked facts
from my wife's record.

32:48.808 --> 32:51.130
You have to consider her motives.

32:51.150 --> 32:53.653
And if you look at Elizabeth McCord's

32:53.653 --> 32:56.071
decades-long record of service,

32:56.080 --> 32:59.031
you see a woman clearly motivated

32:59.031 --> 33:00.880
by Plato's four key virtues:

33:00.897 --> 33:04.820
wisdom, courage,
temperance and justice.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.120
I suggest you look into them.

33:10.970 --> 33:15.573
I'm sure you believe your wife
is infallible, Dr McCord,

33:15.582 --> 33:17.893
just as I believe you think your posts

33:17.893 --> 33:19.662
in the Dalton
and McCord administrations

33:19.662 --> 33:21.190
were based on merit.

33:21.220 --> 33:22.860
Just as you believe your destruction

33:22.890 --> 33:25.768
of a young man's life to serve
your wife's political ambition

33:25.768 --> 33:27.671
was somehow justified.

33:27.706 --> 33:31.493
And your delusion is part
of the tragedy.

33:31.511 --> 33:34.470
Congressman Heeney.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.897
I yield my time to the chairman.

33:45.253 --> 33:47.573
All hail, President McCord.

33:47.608 --> 33:49.644
Mr Volk. Welcome home.

33:49.697 --> 33:51.710
It's truly wonderful to be back.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.191
I haven't felt this liberated

33:53.190 --> 33:54.906
since my first divorce.

33:54.933 --> 33:55.546
Oh!

33:55.688 --> 33:57.271
Please, just give us one

33:57.297 --> 33:58.560
damn news cycle.

33:58.880 --> 34:00.817
News of McCord megadonor

34:00.817 --> 34:03.262
Eli Volk's release
from capture in Moscow

34:03.262 --> 34:05.671
has unleashed a flurry of speculation.

34:05.697 --> 34:07.448
Here with us to give his perspective

34:07.440 --> 34:09.333
is Chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee,

34:09.342 --> 34:11.080
Senator Mark Hanson. Senator?

34:11.100 --> 34:13.480
Thank you, Tracy. You know,
we always have to be skeptical

34:13.500 --> 34:16.920
with this administration
because they are truly skilful

34:16.940 --> 34:19.350
at manipulating public opinion, the media.

34:19.380 --> 34:20.871
Says the guy manipulating the media.

34:20.915 --> 34:22.150
...the spectacle this afternoon.

34:22.177 --> 34:23.697
One of the president's biggest donors

34:23.697 --> 34:26.755
literally bowing down
to her like royalty

34:26.764 --> 34:28.690
earlier today at
Andrews Air Force Base.

34:28.719 --> 34:31.964
This country did overthrow
a monarchy quite some time ago.

34:31.973 --> 34:34.195
There has been some
speculation that it's possible

34:34.195 --> 34:36.141
this entire story of Eli Volk

34:36.141 --> 34:39.226
being kidnapped by Iran could be
another example of McCord's

34:39.226 --> 34:41.170
brilliant media manipulation.

34:41.172 --> 34:42.440
Does this guy ever stop?

34:42.469 --> 34:44.853
Now, normally,
I'm deeply skeptical

34:44.853 --> 34:46.168
of these sorts of rumours, but you have

34:46.168 --> 34:48.150
to ask yourself,
why would the president allow

34:48.170 --> 34:50.980
these so-called kidnappers
to fly home to Tehran

34:51.010 --> 34:52.889
from a U.S. armed military base

34:52.909 --> 34:55.060
- without a single...
- All right, that's enough.

34:55.911 --> 34:58.053
I'm going to need to make a stop.

34:58.133 --> 34:59.460
Thanks for calling.

34:59.480 --> 35:00.690
I hope this isn't too public.

35:00.720 --> 35:01.822
No, it's fine.

35:02.050 --> 35:05.240
I kind of just decided
to live my life, you know?

35:07.090 --> 35:09.700
I'm sorry that I had such a reaction

35:09.730 --> 35:11.100
to the addiction thing.

35:11.130 --> 35:13.410
Oh. No.

35:13.430 --> 35:16.480
I'm sorry you had to find
out on national television.

35:16.730 --> 35:20.710
I think mostly it
threw me because,

35:20.740 --> 35:24.720
well, growing up
with parents in intelligence,

35:24.740 --> 35:28.337
you kind of get used
to there always being

35:28.346 --> 35:31.484
this other story
behind what you're told.

35:31.564 --> 35:33.860
So, yeah. I just...
I think I get sensitive

35:33.880 --> 35:35.848
about what the truth is, you know?

35:35.875 --> 35:36.444
I know.

35:36.471 --> 35:39.564
- And if I can explain.
- Yeah, like your time in Alaska.

35:39.573 --> 35:41.970
You told me that you were alone.

35:41.990 --> 35:44.740
And I'm not proud of this,

35:44.760 --> 35:46.840
but I went through
your social media,

35:46.860 --> 35:49.048
and I saw this one bartender lady

35:49.048 --> 35:50.580
loved all of your posts.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.110
So none of my business,
and I swear I don't care.

35:53.140 --> 35:54.915
- The thing you have to know is that...
- No, it's fine.

35:54.915 --> 35:56.168
Just please don't lie to me.

35:56.270 --> 35:58.204
OK? You had a girlfriend in Alaska.

35:58.204 --> 36:00.995
- It's a totally normal thing.
- She was not my girlfriend.

36:01.022 --> 36:02.648
She worked at this one
bar in town, and...

36:02.650 --> 36:04.684
No, I'm happy that you had someone.

36:04.711 --> 36:06.630
Really. It's just...

36:06.650 --> 36:09.297
Please, don't tell me
that you were alone.

36:09.297 --> 36:10.700
No, but I was.

36:10.720 --> 36:14.200
I mean, yes,  we were
together a few times,

36:14.220 --> 36:16.540
- but it meant nothing.
- Really?

36:16.560 --> 36:18.710
Is that how Bitty would describe it?

36:20.230 --> 36:22.050
I don't know.

36:23.230 --> 36:26.750
Look, she thought I was
no fun, and she was right.

36:26.770 --> 36:29.620
- I had someone else on my mind.
- That's not the point.

36:29.640 --> 36:32.890
I should have been honest.

36:32.910 --> 36:34.755
I'm sorry.

36:36.910 --> 36:39.220
But I could mention you're
the one who had a boyfriend,

36:39.250 --> 36:41.760
and I didn't say anything.

36:41.780 --> 36:43.760
Yeah, well, because

36:43.790 --> 36:45.870
I never tried to hide it.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.670
Of course you didn't say anything.

36:48.690 --> 36:50.040
You're like Jason Bourne.

36:50.060 --> 36:51.600
Just...

36:51.630 --> 36:54.510
Oh, so now I have no feelings
because I was a spy?

36:57.670 --> 37:00.250
I don't know. I think I'm just

37:01.140 --> 37:03.120
recalibrating.

37:03.140 --> 37:04.373
Stevie, you know me better

37:04.373 --> 37:06.120
than anyone except my
sister. Do you think

37:06.140 --> 37:07.750
it was easy for me seeing pictures

37:07.780 --> 37:09.813
of you moving on without me?

37:09.980 --> 37:13.440
Please, don't ever look at
me like you don't know me.

37:15.150 --> 37:17.300
Please.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.110
Sorry.

37:24.960 --> 37:28.140
Since I came here, I lost my country.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.311
I lost my name.

37:30.470 --> 37:34.382
But when I'm with you,
I feel like I'm home.

37:34.740 --> 37:37.911
And I don't want to leave home again.

37:46.720 --> 37:50.540
Ma'am, he'll still be
here tomorrow morning.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.928
Can we please stop
and think about this?

38:01.848 --> 38:03.340
Madam President.

38:03.370 --> 38:04.862
A word?

38:10.210 --> 38:12.180
Saw you on the news.

38:12.210 --> 38:14.560
Generally, my television
appearances don't bring

38:14.568 --> 38:16.560
a state visit to my home.

38:16.580 --> 38:18.222
This isn't a state visit.

38:18.380 --> 38:21.360
This is two Americans talking
about the country we love.

38:21.380 --> 38:23.777
And the country we were
both elected to defend.

38:23.950 --> 38:25.700
Oh. Well, at least privately

38:25.720 --> 38:28.622
you're willing to acknowledge
that I was legitimately elected.

38:28.622 --> 38:29.733
I didn't say legitimate.

38:29.751 --> 38:31.370
But come, let's sit.

38:31.390 --> 38:33.710
About a week ago, you offered

38:33.730 --> 38:36.410
to drop your attacks on me

38:36.430 --> 38:40.280
if I was willing
to bend my office to your will.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.062
That is hardly a fair
representation of what

38:42.062 --> 38:43.715
- I presented to your people.
- Oh, Mark.

38:43.715 --> 38:47.350
I don't think you want to talk
fair representation with me.

38:47.380 --> 38:51.128
But my point is
if you actually believe

38:51.128 --> 38:53.217
those things you said
on television today,

38:53.217 --> 38:55.715
that I staged a kidnapping

38:55.715 --> 38:58.835
to distract
from some ongoing conspiracy

38:58.835 --> 39:00.070
with a foreign enemy,

39:00.090 --> 39:02.370
you'd have to be an utter hypocrite

39:02.390 --> 39:04.070
to be willing to overlook that

39:04.090 --> 39:06.337
in exchange
for some political influence.

39:06.337 --> 39:08.070
We've already had this discussion

39:08.100 --> 39:09.810
when you called me, what was it,

39:09.830 --> 39:11.810
"a cheap shakedown artist."

39:11.830 --> 39:14.180
That was before you dragged
my family into it.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.310
Now it's personal.

39:15.340 --> 39:16.977
I'm not responsible
for the questioning

39:16.977 --> 39:17.946
of the House inquiry.

39:18.044 --> 39:20.620
The inquiry that started
with your report.

39:20.640 --> 39:24.360
You are directly responsible for this.

39:24.380 --> 39:28.320
What I can't understand is why.

39:28.410 --> 39:30.826
You can't actually believe

39:30.826 --> 39:33.410
that I would arrange a relationship

39:33.413 --> 39:35.570
between my daughter and a Russian spy

39:35.590 --> 39:37.240
to win an election.

39:39.260 --> 39:42.110
Why don't we discuss this
in a more official capacity?

39:42.130 --> 39:43.955
Because it doesn't feel official,

39:43.955 --> 39:45.840
what you're doing to me, Mark.

39:45.946 --> 39:47.850
You're obsessed with destroying me,

39:47.870 --> 39:50.906
and you're willing to take down
the whole country to do it.

39:50.915 --> 39:52.580
You've got it completely wrong.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.650
I am...

39:54.680 --> 39:56.760
I'm trying to save this country.

39:56.780 --> 39:58.266
From what?

39:58.320 --> 39:59.860
From a falsely elected woman

39:59.880 --> 40:01.875
who rode in on the coat-tails
of her predecessor

40:01.875 --> 40:03.760
and manipulated foreign influence

40:03.768 --> 40:06.142
to hoodwink the American people.

40:06.320 --> 40:09.840
You are a travesty and an aberration,

40:09.860 --> 40:12.270
and when you are finally gone

40:12.290 --> 40:14.391
and a real leader takes your place,

40:14.391 --> 40:15.893
this country will shine out again

40:15.893 --> 40:18.950
like the beacon of hope
she's always been.

40:31.050 --> 40:33.860
We don't come in here enough.

40:33.880 --> 40:37.200
Well, it's too intimidating.

40:37.220 --> 40:39.066
Now it's depressing.

40:39.260 --> 40:42.230
I went to Hanson's house.

40:42.260 --> 40:44.346
Nice house, by the way.

40:46.530 --> 40:48.510
He called me

40:48.530 --> 40:51.110
a "falsely elected woman."

40:52.417 --> 40:53.750
I think maybe the "woman" part

40:53.770 --> 40:56.088
is the thing that bothers him most.

40:57.564 --> 41:00.420
You know I never wanted to go there.

41:00.440 --> 41:03.720
But he said something so striking.

41:03.750 --> 41:05.560
After I'm gone,

41:05.580 --> 41:07.830
the country will go back

41:07.850 --> 41:09.590
to being the beacon of hope

41:09.620 --> 41:12.770
she's always been.

41:13.960 --> 41:17.940
Why can he call the country "she"

41:17.960 --> 41:20.270
but not the president?

41:20.300 --> 41:21.710
I assume you're not asking me

41:21.730 --> 41:23.440
why English dropped
most gendered nouns.

41:25.370 --> 41:28.110
We did keep "she" for two of them.

41:28.140 --> 41:30.488
- Ships and countries.
- Yeah.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.520
Why is that?

41:33.710 --> 41:36.350
Maybe because they both

41:36.380 --> 41:38.690
carry us like mothers.

41:38.710 --> 41:41.800
And if they go down,
we all go down with them.

41:42.650 --> 41:44.230
For some people, that kind of power

41:44.250 --> 41:45.660
is just too scary in a woman.

41:45.690 --> 41:48.570
They can deal with it
in the abstract, but

41:48.590 --> 41:50.257
not in a leader.

41:51.680 --> 41:55.010
They're never going to make
room for me, are they?

41:55.030 --> 41:57.510
Not all of them.

41:57.530 --> 41:59.680
Not yet.

42:00.737 --> 42:03.180
Henry,

42:03.210 --> 42:06.690
I think I want to testify
before the House.

42:08.210 --> 42:10.190
OK.

42:10.210 --> 42:13.190
I doubt that's what
Russell's going to say.

42:13.220 --> 42:15.860
You're the president.

42:15.890 --> 42:18.040
For now.

42:19.191 --> 42:21.270
Do you really think it'll be worth it?

42:21.290 --> 42:23.057
No.

42:23.260 --> 42:27.740
But I figure I may as
well get my day in court.

42:27.760 --> 42:30.480
Before the ship goes down.

42:32.595 --> 42:35.380
