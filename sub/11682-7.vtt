<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.635 --> 00:07.012
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.014 --> 00:09.521
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing -</i>

00:09.588 --> 00:12.284
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.352 --> 00:14.651
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.715 --> 00:16.615
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:17.107 --> 00:20.349
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:20.416 --> 00:22.978
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:23.046 --> 00:24.577
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.645 --> 00:26.213
Should we shoot them?

00:26.281 --> 00:28.713
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.780 --> 00:31.182
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.249 --> 00:33.549
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.616 --> 00:35.751
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.819 --> 00:38.385
Bottom line --
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:38.453 --> 00:40.054
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:53.381 --> 00:55.515
<i>In any surveillance operation,</i>

00:55.583 --> 00:58.485
<i>you have to resist the impulse</i>
<i>to grab your target</i>

00:58.486 --> 00:59.853
<i>and interrogate him</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

00:59.921 --> 01:01.222
<i>It may be tempting,</i>

01:01.289 --> 01:03.555
<i>particularly</i>
<i>when your target was, say,</i>

01:03.623 --> 01:05.289
<i>involved in framing you</i>
<i>for a murder.</i>

01:09.692 --> 01:12.224
<i>Of course, just because</i>
<i>it's the right way to do things</i>

01:12.292 --> 01:13.825
<i>doesn't make it fun.</i>

01:21.863 --> 01:23.831
We've been here
<i>two</i> days, Sam.

01:23.899 --> 01:26.933
Face it -- this guy is not
calling the shots.

01:27.001 --> 01:29.235
He has Christmas lights
hanging in July.

01:29.303 --> 01:31.037
He may look a little bit
like Michael,

01:31.104 --> 01:33.473
but there is no way he's capable
of killing a CIA officer

01:33.541 --> 01:34.908
and setting Michael up
for it.

01:34.975 --> 01:37.276
Yeah, well, I don't think
he's capable of setting a table.

01:37.344 --> 01:38.511
Yesterday,
I found a brochure

01:38.579 --> 01:40.545
about raising Alpacas for profit
in his trash.

01:40.613 --> 01:42.246
So let's scrap
this cloak and dagger

01:42.314 --> 01:43.581
and go have a little chat.

01:43.648 --> 01:45.449
I'm wearing my door-kicking
Jimmy Choos.

01:45.517 --> 01:46.717
Fi, you know the drill.

01:46.785 --> 01:48.918
You want to find out
who this guys works for,

01:48.985 --> 01:50.185
you hang back and watch.

01:53.555 --> 01:55.855
What if he doesn't live
through the day?

01:55.923 --> 01:58.123
Oh, crap.

01:59.859 --> 02:01.325
A sledgehammer
and some guns.

02:01.393 --> 02:03.126
I don't think they're here
to play bridge.

02:04.695 --> 02:05.762
And you're smiling.

02:05.830 --> 02:06.997
We get to do it my way.

02:07.064 --> 02:08.197
No, we don't,

02:08.264 --> 02:09.899
'cause we can't risk
being exposed.

02:09.967 --> 02:11.134
Well,
we have to do something.

02:11.202 --> 02:12.268
Yes, what we have to do

02:12.336 --> 02:14.270
is orchestra
Jacob's miraculous escape

02:14.337 --> 02:15.538
from the Mac-10 brigade.

02:15.605 --> 02:19.108
All right. Head in.
Let's make it peaceful.

02:19.175 --> 02:20.275
I'll meet you both
out back --

02:20.343 --> 02:21.710
unless a little war
breaks out.

02:21.778 --> 02:23.612
Fi...No war.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.248
Fine. No war.

02:32.588 --> 02:34.856
Mr. Pickles?

02:34.924 --> 02:37.292
Is that you, pal?

02:37.359 --> 02:38.693
Hey, Jacob.

02:38.761 --> 02:40.194
Wait, look,
don't kill me, please!

02:40.262 --> 02:41.829
Ah, don't you worry
about a thing.

02:41.897 --> 02:43.797
I'm not here to kill you.

02:43.865 --> 02:45.566
<i>They're</i> here to kill you.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.900
Wait a second.
Who are you?

02:46.968 --> 02:48.335
Never mind.
I'll explain later.

02:48.403 --> 02:49.703
You need to go out
the back.

02:49.771 --> 02:51.004
There's a tiny, little woman
in a Hyundai

02:51.072 --> 02:52.306
who's gonna protect you.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.274
Ah. Here we go.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.542
Hang on.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.076
Don't forget Mr. Pickles.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.478
A-aren't you coming?

02:59.546 --> 03:01.280
No, I'm gonna cover
your escape.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.716
So I need the keys to the truck
in your garage and this hat.

03:03.783 --> 03:04.750
Yeah, I-I --

03:04.817 --> 03:05.750
No more talking.

03:05.818 --> 03:07.085
Time to go. Now.

03:07.152 --> 03:08.052
Bye, Mr. Pickles.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.520
<i>As a spy,</i>

03:09.588 --> 03:11.021
<i>a lot of missions</i>
<i>depend on the world</i>

03:11.089 --> 03:12.523
<i>not knowing you're there.</i>

03:14.125 --> 03:16.492
<i>When an op involves</i>
<i>saving someone's life</i>

03:16.560 --> 03:18.627
<i>and keeping</i>
<i>your presence unknown,</i>

03:18.695 --> 03:21.096
<i>you have to make their escape</i>
<i>look credible.</i>

03:22.231 --> 03:25.333
<i>So if the person you're saving</i>
<i>is an untrained civilian,</i>

03:25.401 --> 03:28.335
<i>you need to make it look liked</i>

03:28.403 --> 03:30.371
<i>like an untrained civilian.</i>

03:36.211 --> 03:37.912
Hi. I'm Jacob.

03:37.979 --> 03:39.113
This guy broke into --

03:39.180 --> 03:41.314
Honey, what just heard
wasn't fireworks.

03:41.382 --> 03:42.916
Get in the damn car.

04:04.781 --> 04:06.448
Where have you been?

04:06.515 --> 04:08.416
Two-hour meeting
with Pearce.

04:08.484 --> 04:10.118
She's taking agents
to Egypt

04:10.185 --> 04:12.520
to run down a lead
she thinks she found.

04:12.587 --> 04:14.321
Good. That should give us
a little breathing room.

04:14.323 --> 04:15.622
I got your message.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.524
This is my "I'm concerned

04:17.591 --> 04:21.628
we just kidnapped our only lead
back to Max's killer" face.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.029
Well, be glad it's not your

04:23.097 --> 04:24.865
"Our only lead got murdered
by a Latino gang" face.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.701
A group of thugs was moving in
to send cob to the morgue.

04:27.769 --> 04:28.869
We had to pull him out.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.171
According to Jacob,

04:30.238 --> 04:32.406
he was doing some odd jobs
for some mystery man

04:32.474 --> 04:34.208
who contacted him
over the Internet.

04:34.210 --> 04:35.376
And more recently

04:35.444 --> 04:37.812
he was delivering unmarked
packages in Overtown.

04:37.879 --> 04:39.046
I'm guessing drugs.

04:39.114 --> 04:40.782
The gang thought he was dealing
on their turf

04:40.850 --> 04:42.217
and tried to take him out.

04:42.285 --> 04:45.020
Whoever used Jacob to set you up
is trying to get rid of him.

04:45.088 --> 04:47.823
Where is he now?

04:47.891 --> 04:50.025
Hiding.
Upstairs.

04:50.093 --> 04:52.661
What does he know
about us?

04:52.663 --> 04:54.830
Well, I kept the details
to a minimum

04:54.898 --> 04:57.599
but I explained that it's in
his best interest and <i>ours</i>

04:57.667 --> 04:59.901
to find his boss.

05:01.437 --> 05:03.571
Something else
you forget to mention?

05:03.639 --> 05:06.941
He brought his doggie?

05:10.714 --> 05:12.615
I really think
I should run.

05:12.683 --> 05:14.517
Seriously,
I-I can just grab my stuff --

05:14.585 --> 05:17.287
Jacob, listen.
That is not an option.

05:17.355 --> 05:18.621
Know what?
I think you're wrong.

05:18.689 --> 05:19.722
I think
it's the <i>only</i> option.

05:19.790 --> 05:21.524
Well, running
will work just fine...

05:21.592 --> 05:23.460
Until your boss catches you
and kills you.

05:23.528 --> 05:24.828
We can help you.

05:24.896 --> 05:26.796
You just have to tell us
what you know about him.

05:26.864 --> 05:28.632
I have <i>no</i> idea who he is.

05:28.699 --> 05:32.235
H-he contacted me by e-mail
about doing some odd jobs.

05:32.303 --> 05:33.470
Can -- I go now?

05:33.537 --> 05:35.538
No, you can't.

05:35.606 --> 05:37.140
Are you in the habit of taking shady
jobs that you find on the Internet?

05:37.208 --> 05:38.275
I had no choice.

05:38.343 --> 05:40.511
Construction's dead.
I needed cash.

05:40.579 --> 05:42.179
How did this guy pay you?

05:42.247 --> 05:47.184
He, uh, mailed me cash,
then texted me the next gig.

05:47.252 --> 05:49.320
The money was good.
I didn't ask questions.

05:49.388 --> 05:51.222
Until a gang
took a shot at you.

05:51.290 --> 05:52.757
I'm in over my head here!

05:52.825 --> 05:54.659
And I can't even
go to the cops,

05:54.727 --> 05:57.195
because apparently,
I helped out on a murder

05:57.263 --> 05:58.529
and a bunch
of drug deals.

05:58.597 --> 06:00.331
Your only way out of this
is with us.

06:00.399 --> 06:02.066
You need to help us get in touch
with your boss.

06:02.134 --> 06:03.668
I can't.

06:03.736 --> 06:06.438
The phone he gave me to contact
him with is at my house.

06:06.506 --> 06:08.173
And I am <i>not</i>
<i>going back there.</i>

06:08.241 --> 06:12.010
Fi, I have this job
with Sam.

06:12.078 --> 06:13.779
Thanks, Fi.

06:22.056 --> 06:23.023
Hey, Sam.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.525
Mikey.

06:24.592 --> 06:25.759
Back to the old look,
huh?

06:25.827 --> 06:27.726
Well, I figured since people
are trying to kill me,

06:27.751 --> 06:30.043
it's not the worse idea to
change my appearance a little.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.932
Mm. Can't argue
with that logic.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.235
You're drinking iced tea,
Sam?

06:34.303 --> 06:36.704
This job you have
must be serious.

06:36.772 --> 06:39.740
Well, serious enough
I got to keep a clear head.

06:39.808 --> 06:41.242
My lady needs a favor.

06:41.309 --> 06:44.078
She said she would do <i>anything</i>
<i>if I helped her.</i>

06:45.681 --> 06:46.714
Anything, Mike.

06:46.716 --> 06:48.649
Do you have any idea
what that means?

06:48.717 --> 06:51.786
I don't need to.
So, what's the favor?

06:51.854 --> 06:54.139
Well, Elsa was helping out
this women's legal aid group.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.748
She met a gal, Denise O'Lear.

06:55.926 --> 06:59.662
Separated from her husband,
custody problems with their son.

06:59.730 --> 07:01.464
Daddy was supposed to bring
the kid back yesterday,

07:01.531 --> 07:02.765
but I guess he didn't show.

07:02.832 --> 07:04.332
I'm not a family
counselor, Sam.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.067
No, but you were
an Army Ranger,

07:06.135 --> 07:09.097
just like this guy's brother --
K.I.A. in Afghanistan.

07:09.204 --> 07:11.002
Yeah.

07:11.003 --> 07:12.325
Apparently after --

07:12.350 --> 07:13.875
Uh, why don't
I let her tell it.

07:13.876 --> 07:15.643
Hey, Denise.
Over here.

07:16.077 --> 07:17.311
Hi, Sam.

07:17.379 --> 07:18.645
Hi.

07:18.713 --> 07:21.014
So, uh,
this is my buddy Mike,

07:21.082 --> 07:23.483
the guy I was
telling you about.

07:23.551 --> 07:27.020
We just got to the part
about, uh, John's brother.

07:27.088 --> 07:28.923
My husband was a good man,

07:28.990 --> 07:31.692
but he changed
when he lost his brother.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.861
After he quit job,

07:33.929 --> 07:35.797
he wanted to move out
of the city,

07:35.865 --> 07:37.332
said he wanted
to protect us.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.535
So he has your son
right now?

07:39.603 --> 07:41.136
That's where come in, Mike.

07:41.204 --> 07:43.706
Just one quick chat
to convince John

07:43.774 --> 07:45.007
to bring the kid
back home.

07:45.075 --> 07:46.342
We'll see
what we can do.

07:46.409 --> 07:47.576
Thank you.

07:47.644 --> 07:50.311
When you see John,
can you just go easy on him?

07:50.379 --> 07:51.913
He's had such a hard time.

07:51.981 --> 07:53.381
We're just
gonna talk to him.

08:12.368 --> 08:14.169
Say, Sam?

08:14.237 --> 08:15.471
Yeah, Mike.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.554
Why does it look like someone

08:16.555 --> 08:18.789
spent some time and money
fortifying John's house?

08:18.857 --> 08:20.291
Because someone spent
some time and money

08:20.359 --> 08:21.993
fortifying John's house.

08:22.061 --> 08:25.330
This is feeling like more than
a "One quick chat" kinda job.

08:25.397 --> 08:26.931
Mike, don't be like that.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.566
We're here.
John's here.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.168
I'm sure it'll be fine.

08:30.236 --> 08:31.203
- Fine?
- Yeah.

08:31.270 --> 08:32.938
And in the event
that it isn't --

08:33.005 --> 08:34.606
ha ha --
I brought a tracker.

08:34.674 --> 08:36.575
I'll just plant this
on his truck

08:36.643 --> 08:38.143
in case he,
you know, flees.

08:39.178 --> 08:40.979
Mike, come on. What's the worst
that could happen?

08:41.047 --> 08:43.148
John could tell you to get lost,
and we just talk to a lawyer.

08:48.422 --> 08:51.091
<i>Spies deal</i>
<i>with foreign agencies,</i>

08:51.159 --> 08:52.392
<i>dirty corporations,</i>

08:52.460 --> 08:54.495
<i>and criminal syndicates</i>
<i>all the time,</i>

08:54.563 --> 08:57.265
<i>but none of them compares</i>
<i>to dealing with families.</i>

08:57.332 --> 08:59.367
<i>Asking a man to take apart</i>
<i>his business</i>

08:59.435 --> 09:01.036
<i>or turn on his country is easy</i>

09:01.103 --> 09:03.172
<i>compared to going</i>
<i>into a man's home</i>

09:03.239 --> 09:05.841
<i>and telling him how to deal</i>
<i>with the people he loves.</i>

09:18.354 --> 09:21.022
<i>It's usually a good idea...</i>

09:21.090 --> 09:22.557
Who are you?

09:22.582 --> 09:23.782
<i>To tell the truth.</i>

09:24.059 --> 09:26.761
<i>My name's Michael.</i>
<i>I'm a friend of your wife's.</i>

09:26.829 --> 09:29.430
Denise asked me come check
on your son.

09:29.498 --> 09:30.932
Tommy's fine.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.967
Oh, I'm sure he is.

09:33.035 --> 09:35.503
I promised Denise
I'd come talk to you.

09:35.570 --> 09:38.572
Look, it is hot out here.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.741
Do you mind if I come inside
to chat?

09:40.809 --> 09:43.977
Neither one of us wants to get
the law involved here, do we?

09:46.781 --> 09:48.548
Fine.
Come in.

09:48.550 --> 09:49.949
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

09:54.922 --> 09:56.790
So, where's Tommy?

09:56.857 --> 09:58.291
It's none of your business.

09:58.359 --> 10:00.126
You want to talk,

10:00.194 --> 10:02.362
you stay right where you are
and talk.

10:02.430 --> 10:03.863
John,
you don't have to do that.

10:03.931 --> 10:05.031
Hey, hey.

10:05.099 --> 10:06.199
What, do you think
you're clever?

10:06.266 --> 10:07.967
Turning to make yourself
a smaller target,

10:08.035 --> 10:09.269
angling towards
my off hand.

10:09.336 --> 10:11.237
I said do not move.

10:12.906 --> 10:14.140
Who the hell are you?

10:14.208 --> 10:16.075
What, you work
for the government?

10:16.143 --> 10:17.810
No, I'm not
with the government.

10:19.126 --> 10:21.093
Your brother was a Ranger,
right?

10:21.161 --> 10:23.095
So was I.

10:23.163 --> 10:24.997
Bravo Company,
3rd Ranger Battalion.

10:25.065 --> 10:26.184
I know what you're
going through, John.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.409
I lost a lot of good friends
on the battlefield.

10:28.101 --> 10:29.168
Good men,
just like your brother.

10:30.670 --> 10:32.504
You said that...

10:33.806 --> 10:35.440
...My wife sent you?

10:37.209 --> 10:38.843
How is she?

10:38.911 --> 10:40.344
She's fine.

10:40.412 --> 10:43.114
She'd be better if I could
tell her how Tommy's doing.

10:43.181 --> 10:46.317
John, I'm here
for one simple reason.

10:46.385 --> 10:48.853
You should have dropped Tommy
off with his mother yesterday,

10:48.920 --> 10:50.554
according to
your custody agreement.

10:50.622 --> 10:52.457
Yeah, well, who made me sign
that stupid agreement?

10:52.524 --> 10:53.858
Huh?

10:53.926 --> 10:55.658
A judge from Chicago.

10:55.683 --> 10:58.776
A little tiny, weasel of a man, on a government payroll

10:58.831 --> 11:01.533
sat there telling me
what's best for my family?

11:01.601 --> 11:04.537
He doesn't take care
of them -- <i>I</i> do.

11:04.605 --> 11:06.573
So who the hell is he to tell me
how to take care of my family?!
John.

11:06.640 --> 11:07.974
Calm down.
I'm on your side.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.475
I'm not here to talk
about a judge.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.012
I'm here to talk about getting
Tommy back with his mom.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.750
No.
Tommy stays with me.

11:15.817 --> 11:17.485
Okay, then...
Let's go together.

11:17.553 --> 11:21.390
John, I came here of respect
for your brother --

11:21.457 --> 11:24.025
out of respect
for his sacrifice.

11:24.093 --> 11:26.895
Put the shotgun down
and talk to me.

11:26.963 --> 11:28.463
Please.

11:34.537 --> 11:36.071
Okay.

11:36.139 --> 11:38.273
Keep out, huh?

11:38.341 --> 11:39.775
What are you hiding
in here, pal?

11:43.479 --> 11:46.548
I <i>knew</i> you lied to me!

11:46.616 --> 11:48.183
What, you got somebody
out back, huh?

11:48.251 --> 11:49.284
Tommy, get the packs now!

11:49.352 --> 11:50.519
No.
John, this is a mistake.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.187
I'm not here to hurt you
or your son.

11:52.255 --> 11:54.556
Stop talking right now.
Stop talking right now.

11:54.624 --> 11:55.891
Tommy, let's go!

11:58.428 --> 12:00.062
- Where are we going?
- It's okay. It's okay.

12:00.130 --> 12:01.697
We're leaving.

12:01.765 --> 12:04.633
<i>There are dozens of ways</i>
<i>to disarm a man with a gun,</i>

12:04.701 --> 12:07.136
<i>but unfortunately,</i>
<i>they all come with a risk</i>

12:07.203 --> 12:08.470
<i>that the gun will go off.</i>

12:08.538 --> 12:10.138
<i>No matter how good you are,</i>

12:10.206 --> 12:12.775
<i>it's not something you want</i>
<i>to try with a child present.</i>

12:12.843 --> 12:15.110
You lead the way.
Let's go.

12:15.178 --> 12:17.246
<i>Unless you want</i>
<i>to tell a bereaved mom</i>

12:17.314 --> 12:20.550
<i>that you gambled with her kid's</i>
<i>life, because you felt lucky.</i>

12:23.152 --> 12:24.853
So, where's
your friend hiding?

12:28.057 --> 12:28.690
Sam, down!

12:28.758 --> 12:29.957
Just get away from us!

12:31.226 --> 12:32.293
Come on.

12:32.361 --> 12:34.628
You stay on the ground!

12:34.696 --> 12:36.230
You're not taking my son!
You hear me? Go.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.132
And don't even try
to follow us!

12:51.812 --> 12:54.715
Well,
good news and bad news.

12:54.783 --> 12:55.882
Bad news you know --

12:55.950 --> 12:57.584
I guess I tripped
the motion detector.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.619
The good news is
I planted the tracker.

12:59.687 --> 13:02.188
Now we'll know where he's going.
We can get the kid back.

13:02.256 --> 13:06.092
Sam, I don't think this is
gonna be quite that simple.

13:09.069 --> 13:11.069
We found these in John's house.

13:11.285 --> 13:12.852
Oh, my God.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.288
That's the place John
was always talking about.

13:15.356 --> 13:17.090
He -- he went
with his friends.

13:17.158 --> 13:18.958
He called it
a-a training facility.

13:19.026 --> 13:21.728
It is, of sorts.

13:21.796 --> 13:24.531
John's there now
with your son.

13:24.599 --> 13:25.699
Oh, God.

13:25.767 --> 13:27.168
Okay, we need to call
the police.

13:27.235 --> 13:28.535
Okay, we need to call them right now.
No.

13:28.603 --> 13:30.470
That is the last thing
we should do.

13:30.538 --> 13:32.206
Why <i>not</i> call the police,
Michael?

13:32.273 --> 13:33.841
Because this isn't
a summer camp, Ma.

13:33.908 --> 13:36.009
It's the home
of a fringe militia

13:36.077 --> 13:38.212
with some
very antigovernment views.

13:38.279 --> 13:39.580
How many men
are in a militia?

13:39.647 --> 13:41.849
At this one, about 20.

13:41.916 --> 13:43.217
- We have to call the police!
- Trust me.

13:43.285 --> 13:45.786
If the police show up,
there will be violence.

13:45.854 --> 13:48.856
Sam's already there,
and I'm calling in some friends.

13:48.924 --> 13:51.225
Okay, I need
to get my son back.

13:51.293 --> 13:52.960
We will.
We just need to be careful.

13:53.028 --> 13:56.197
No, you don't understand, okay?
Tommy is asthmatic.

13:56.265 --> 13:58.366
The longer he stays out in
those woods, the more likely...

13:58.434 --> 14:00.402
Look, I just refilled
his prescription

14:00.470 --> 14:03.105
because the inhaler Tommy
has with him is almost empty.

14:03.173 --> 14:04.774
That might be something
we can use.

14:04.841 --> 14:06.076
It's not ideal...

14:06.143 --> 14:09.746
But it'll give us a reason
for John to talk to us.

14:09.814 --> 14:11.982
If anything happens
to Tommy...

14:12.050 --> 14:15.320
John has some serious problems,
but he cares about your son.

14:15.387 --> 14:17.221
I'm gonna go now,

14:17.288 --> 14:19.456
and I'm gonna get you
your son back.

14:24.562 --> 14:27.063
Ma, you need
to keep her calm.

14:27.131 --> 14:28.364
She's --

14:28.432 --> 14:30.165
She married
the wrong man.

14:30.233 --> 14:31.400
I know something
about that.

14:31.467 --> 14:32.968
Just go get Tommy.

14:40.715 --> 14:41.865
<i>You can tell a lot about a group</i>

14:41.878 --> 14:43.545
<i>from looking at there base.</i>

14:43.613 --> 14:45.781
<i>Their fortifications</i>
<i>can tell you</i>

14:45.848 --> 14:48.851
<i>whether they're focused</i>
<i>on offense or defense.</i>

14:48.918 --> 14:50.686
<i>And their vehicle type</i>
<i>and number</i>

14:50.754 --> 14:52.187
<i>can tell you how mobile</i>
<i>they are.</i>

14:52.255 --> 14:55.424
<i>The most important thing</i>
<i>to check -- their weapons.</i>

14:55.491 --> 14:57.359
<i>If they're carrying M16s</i>
<i>on full auto,</i>

14:57.426 --> 14:59.427
<i>you're probably not dealing</i>
<i>with amateurs</i>

14:59.495 --> 15:00.529
<i>camping in the woods.</i>

15:00.596 --> 15:02.330
They are locked down tight.

15:02.398 --> 15:05.300
Yep. Nobody in or out
since John and Tommy arrived.

15:05.368 --> 15:09.104
And they probably don't take
too kindly to visitors.

15:09.106 --> 15:11.373
I don't see a way
to get in clean.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.874
Well, that's because
there isn't.

15:12.942 --> 15:14.676
And you know what?
That's not even the bad news.

15:14.744 --> 15:15.910
<i>That's</i> the bad news.

15:15.978 --> 15:18.280
Guy's name is Zechariah.
He's the E.N.I.C.

15:20.983 --> 15:23.918
"Extremist nut bag
in charge."

15:26.889 --> 15:28.156
The ATF is
investigating him

15:28.224 --> 15:30.191
for stealing C-4
from the Forest Service.

15:30.259 --> 15:32.393
I got the kid's meds
from his mom.

15:32.461 --> 15:33.895
Let me see what I can do.

15:36.865 --> 15:40.067
Hey, son,
come over here and sit down.

15:40.134 --> 15:42.035
I got this.
Come here.

15:50.777 --> 15:52.544
- Hello?
- John, it's Michael.

15:54.714 --> 15:56.348
You got some balls
calling me.

15:56.416 --> 15:57.983
What the hell do you want?

15:58.051 --> 15:59.485
I want to meet.
I'm outside the compound.

15:59.553 --> 16:00.953
I told you

16:01.021 --> 16:02.121
<i>not</i> to follow me.

16:02.189 --> 16:03.289
I <i>had</i> to.

16:03.357 --> 16:04.457
I had to bring
Tommy's medicine.

16:04.525 --> 16:05.926
John, listen to me.

16:05.993 --> 16:07.962
The inhaler you have in there
is gonna run out soon.

16:08.029 --> 16:09.330
I need to give you
a new one.

16:09.398 --> 16:10.932
Okay.
So leave it outside.

16:10.999 --> 16:11.999
I'll go and get it later.

16:12.067 --> 16:13.301
I can't do that.

16:13.368 --> 16:15.036
I promised Denise I'd make sure
Tommy was okay.

16:15.103 --> 16:17.104
I promised her
I'd see him myself.

16:17.172 --> 16:18.773
Okay. Fine.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.707
I'll meet you out front
in a little bit,

16:20.775 --> 16:22.977
but it's gonna take a few hours
to get it approved.

16:23.044 --> 16:24.177
I'm not going anywhere.

16:24.245 --> 16:26.245
You're planning something,
Mike.

16:26.313 --> 16:27.280
I can see
the wheels turning.

16:27.347 --> 16:29.448
This compound
isn't on city power.

16:29.516 --> 16:31.884
Their generators run
off that fuel tank.

16:31.952 --> 16:34.419
If we sabotage it,
we'll be able to replace it.

16:34.487 --> 16:36.955
Right. Kind of like
a trojan horse play.

16:37.023 --> 16:39.458
So someone has to ride in
on a fuel truck

16:39.526 --> 16:40.760
into that compound.

16:40.827 --> 16:42.394
Uh, yeah.
That sounds dangerous.

16:42.462 --> 16:44.630
I know their type, Sam.
They're not coming out.

16:44.697 --> 16:46.031
We have to get someone in.

16:46.099 --> 16:48.166
And here I thought
this was just gonna be

16:48.234 --> 16:50.201
a light-and-easy
deal-with-Jacob week.

16:50.269 --> 16:53.438
- How many bangers we got inside?
- Three.

16:53.506 --> 16:55.040
Shouldn't be too hard for me
to sneak past them.

16:55.108 --> 16:56.041
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

16:56.109 --> 16:57.476
Or, you know,
I could go in,

16:57.544 --> 16:59.712
and you could stay out here,
because --

16:59.780 --> 17:01.447
If you're about to say
'cause I'm a woman,

17:01.515 --> 17:02.954
I'm gonna knock your teeth
down your throat.

17:02.979 --> 17:03.884
No, Fi.

17:03.885 --> 17:05.819
One of us to stay out here
and provide cover

17:05.887 --> 17:07.221
if the other one
wants to bail out.

17:07.288 --> 17:08.689
We both know
you're the better shot.

17:08.756 --> 17:09.923
Come on.

17:09.991 --> 17:12.826
Fine.

17:12.894 --> 17:15.895
<i>Sneaking past trained</i>
<i>operatives waiting in ambush</i>

17:15.963 --> 17:17.830
<i>is usually next to impossible.</i>

17:17.897 --> 17:19.332
<i>They can stay alert</i>

17:19.398 --> 17:22.166
<i>through the long, boring hours</i>
<i>of waiting,</i>

17:22.234 --> 17:24.536
<i>ready for action at any second.</i>

17:24.604 --> 17:27.805
<i>Amateurs, on the other hand,</i>
<i>tend to relax,</i>

17:27.873 --> 17:30.641
<i>which can give you the opening</i>
<i>you need.</i>

18:04.339 --> 18:06.307
Uh, Jesse, we only needed
Jacob's phone.

18:06.374 --> 18:08.709
You might want to brush up
on your counting skills.

18:08.777 --> 18:10.110
You know what?
You're in no position

18:10.178 --> 18:11.411
to lecture me
about counting, lady,

18:11.479 --> 18:13.279
because there was four dudes
in there, not three.

18:13.347 --> 18:14.581
Yeah.

18:14.649 --> 18:16.016
And I think the fourth
might have eaten the fifth.

18:16.084 --> 18:17.484
Well, how --

18:17.552 --> 18:19.220
No. You know, no. Just forget
it. Forget it. Let's go.

18:29.967 --> 18:31.567
Sorry.
I know that took forever.

18:31.635 --> 18:33.269
It's fine.
The party hasn't started yet.

18:33.337 --> 18:34.304
Get what you need?

18:34.371 --> 18:36.072
Yeah. Barely.

18:36.140 --> 18:37.940
Drove so fast,
I think I went back in time.

18:38.008 --> 18:39.575
It's not like
I could just run out

18:39.643 --> 18:41.444
the liquid-nitrogen store,
you know.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.012
Any action yet?

18:43.080 --> 18:46.248
No, but there's been some
movement inside the compound.

18:46.316 --> 18:48.250
My guess is
they're getting re--

18:48.318 --> 18:49.552
right on cue.

18:49.619 --> 18:51.887
How long do you need
to sabotage the tank?

18:51.912 --> 18:53.112
Ah, comfortably 20 minutes.

18:53.823 --> 18:55.491
How about uncomfortably?

18:55.559 --> 18:58.128
Geez, Mike, I don't know. 10
minutes, but that's pushing it.

18:58.195 --> 18:59.629
These guys are itching
for action,

18:59.697 --> 19:01.832
so I should be able to keep
all eyes on me for that long.

19:01.899 --> 19:04.101
Okay, I'll work as fast
as I can, but don't forget --

19:04.168 --> 19:06.770
this army may be fake,
but the guns are real.

19:06.838 --> 19:08.505
I know.

19:08.573 --> 19:11.375
You've got 10 minutes, Sam.

19:15.180 --> 19:18.282
<i>Coordinated covert offensives</i>
<i>involving two teams</i>

19:18.350 --> 19:20.351
<i>are a lot like</i>
<i>ballroom dancing.</i>

19:20.418 --> 19:22.719
<i>You have to synchronize</i>
<i>your steps,</i>

19:22.787 --> 19:25.789
<i>time your moves, and always</i>
<i>put your partner first.</i>

19:25.857 --> 19:28.325
<i>But unlike the Tango</i>
<i>or the Two-Step,</i>

19:28.392 --> 19:30.026
<i>it's good form to hog</i>
<i>the limelight</i>

19:30.094 --> 19:31.694
<i>during covert ops.</i>

19:31.762 --> 19:33.329
<i>If all eyes are on you,</i>

19:33.397 --> 19:36.132
<i>your partner can work</i>
<i>undetected on the sidelines.</i>

19:39.438 --> 19:42.273
All right, John.
I have the medicine.

19:42.341 --> 19:45.810
Now, if he starts wheezing,
take two pumps of this --

19:45.878 --> 19:47.846
You come here
to insult me?

19:47.913 --> 19:49.614
Huh?

19:49.682 --> 19:51.383
I know how to take care
of my son.

19:51.450 --> 19:53.685
No, I'm not --
no insult intended.

19:53.753 --> 19:55.420
I lived up to my end
of the bargain.

19:55.488 --> 19:56.354
Let me see Tommy.

19:56.422 --> 19:57.689
Absolutely not.

19:57.756 --> 19:59.524
John and I had a deal.

19:59.592 --> 20:02.427
John does not make
deals here -- I do.

20:02.495 --> 20:03.795
I don't know
who you are --

20:03.863 --> 20:05.096
You want to know
who I am?

20:05.164 --> 20:08.099
I'll tell you who I am.

20:08.167 --> 20:09.801
I am the hand of God.

20:09.869 --> 20:11.870
I am his
righteous soldier.

20:11.937 --> 20:15.340
I am a man who stands,
a man who will not kneel.

20:15.408 --> 20:16.842
That's who I am.

20:16.909 --> 20:18.176
That's great.

20:18.244 --> 20:20.346
I was going to say,
I don't know who you are,

20:20.413 --> 20:22.448
but I doubt you're a doctor.
Are you?

20:22.516 --> 20:23.849
I didn't think so.

20:23.917 --> 20:25.551
And since you're not
a doctor

20:25.619 --> 20:28.355
and the nearest hospital
is miles away,

20:28.422 --> 20:30.958
I was thinking
I should give you this.

20:31.025 --> 20:32.192
It's an oximeter.

20:32.260 --> 20:36.163
Hand it over and leave.

20:36.230 --> 20:41.100
I'll give you the box
if you let me examine the boy.

20:41.167 --> 20:43.970
Now, you can either
give us the box,

20:44.037 --> 20:46.506
or I will take it
off your corpse.

20:55.048 --> 20:56.716
Back inside.

20:59.853 --> 21:03.022
Just wait a damn minute!

21:03.089 --> 21:05.124
I promised Tommy's mother

21:05.191 --> 21:07.794
that I'd at least check
his vitals and report back.

21:07.861 --> 21:09.996
You failed.
Report <i>that.</i>

21:10.063 --> 21:12.498
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to Tommy's father.

21:19.874 --> 21:21.041
This is <i>your</i> decision,
John.

21:21.109 --> 21:22.410
Like hell it is.

21:22.477 --> 21:25.280
Decisions made on this land
are mine.

21:25.348 --> 21:28.116
These are my men,
and they follow my orders.

21:28.184 --> 21:29.251
This isn't even
a real army.

21:29.319 --> 21:30.453
You're not even
real commander.

21:32.089 --> 21:33.489
Correct me if I'm wrong.

21:33.557 --> 21:35.358
You never served
in the U.S. military.

21:35.426 --> 21:38.094
No, never did.

21:38.162 --> 21:39.162
I didn't think so.

21:39.230 --> 21:41.231
A real veteran
always spots the fake.

21:41.298 --> 21:43.800
I served my country,
and I fought in wars.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.602
I didn't run around
he woods,

21:45.669 --> 21:47.537
acting like a soldier
with my beer buddies.

21:52.009 --> 21:53.610
I know your kind.

21:53.678 --> 21:57.848
You think having served
somehow makes you a man.

21:57.916 --> 21:59.584
Well, it does not.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.653
You are not a man.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.722
A man questions
what he is told!

22:04.790 --> 22:07.859
A man does not willingly
accept the lies

22:07.926 --> 22:11.129
that are shoved down his throat
by government!

22:13.632 --> 22:17.368
You are of the blind,
the ignorant.

22:17.436 --> 22:20.438
Me?
My eyes are wide open.

22:20.506 --> 22:24.409
And on my land,
I see nothing but truth.

22:24.476 --> 22:26.844
So I'm gonna do you
a favor.

22:26.912 --> 22:29.113
I'm going to allow you
to live,

22:29.181 --> 22:31.649
let you return to the land
of the weak.

22:31.717 --> 22:33.350
Now,
when you get back there,

22:33.418 --> 22:35.353
I-I do want you
to deliver this message.

22:37.890 --> 22:41.360
If we see you or anyone else
around here again...

22:43.163 --> 22:44.564
...We shoot to kill.

22:59.245 --> 23:00.746
Did -- did Michael see Tommy?
Is he okay?

23:00.813 --> 23:02.213
I just got off the phone
with Sam.

23:02.281 --> 23:03.515
Tommy's still in the compound
with John,

23:03.582 --> 23:05.083
but Mike got him
his medicine.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.085
And they're working on a plan
now to get someone in there.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.587
Oh, thank God.

23:08.655 --> 23:11.657
So, uh, the next step --
I'm gonna need your cellphone.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.826
Yeah, John's not gonna take
Mike's calls anymore.

23:14.828 --> 23:15.860
We figured
he might take yours.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.067
Denise.

23:23.134 --> 23:26.103
It's my son's job
to fix this.

23:26.170 --> 23:28.271
It's your job
to keep it together

23:28.339 --> 23:29.639
for when your boy
comes home.

23:29.707 --> 23:32.976
Great job I'm doing so.

23:33.043 --> 23:34.711
Hey, come on.

23:34.778 --> 23:36.879
Look, I was raised
by a single mom.

23:36.947 --> 23:38.147
Okay?
It's not easy.

23:38.215 --> 23:40.250
You did right by your son,
coming to us.

23:40.317 --> 23:42.218
And as soon as this is over,
you'll do right by him again.

23:42.286 --> 23:44.754
Okay.

23:44.822 --> 23:46.155
<i>Using an untrained asset</i>

23:46.223 --> 23:48.758
<i>to make contact with a target</i>
<i>is never ideal.</i>

23:48.826 --> 23:51.328
<i>Meeting in person would be</i>
<i>an outright failure.</i>

23:51.395 --> 23:53.463
<i>So it helps to do it</i>
<i>over the phone.</i>

23:53.531 --> 23:56.800
<i>That way you can write</i>
<i>the script for the asset,</i>

23:56.868 --> 23:59.436
<i>and all they have to do</i>
<i>is read -- most of the time.</i>

23:59.503 --> 24:01.171
I-I-I can't do this.

24:01.238 --> 24:03.306
You can, Jacob,
and you will.

24:03.374 --> 24:05.108
I can't. I really can't.
I think I'm hyperventilating.

24:05.176 --> 24:06.609
Listen to me.

24:06.677 --> 24:09.045
U do this, we find this guy,
and we get rid of him.

24:09.113 --> 24:11.915
I can't remember anything
I'm supposed to say.

24:11.982 --> 24:13.950
That's why I wrote you
a script.

24:14.018 --> 24:15.218
Start dialing.

24:19.423 --> 24:20.790
It's ringing.
It's ringing.

24:22.826 --> 24:24.460
It went to voicemail.

24:25.863 --> 24:27.563
Dude, it's me.

24:27.631 --> 24:29.331
I don't know
what's going on,

24:29.399 --> 24:31.733
but some gang guys
are trying to kill me.

24:31.801 --> 24:34.436
I think it's 'cause of some
of the stuff you had me do.

24:34.503 --> 24:36.771
I really need
your help, man.

24:36.839 --> 24:37.772
Call me.

24:40.809 --> 24:42.910
Well, I guess
that'll have to do.

24:42.978 --> 24:44.378
What if he
doesn't get it?

24:44.446 --> 24:46.213
I mean, what if he doesn't check
his voicemail or something?

24:46.281 --> 24:47.814
Ever since
you fell of the grid,

24:47.882 --> 24:49.816
I'm sure your employer is dying
to talk to you.

24:49.884 --> 24:51.384
What makes you so s--

24:51.452 --> 24:53.319
It's a text.
I got a text.

24:55.190 --> 24:57.925
"Happy to help.
Stay safe.

24:57.993 --> 25:00.462
I'll be in touch."

25:00.530 --> 25:02.731
So...What does that mean?

25:02.799 --> 25:04.934
It means that
you're gonna hang here.

25:05.001 --> 25:06.169
I got to go.

25:06.236 --> 25:08.638
And when your boss
decides get in touch,

25:08.706 --> 25:10.774
we'll decide
what our next move is.

25:10.841 --> 25:13.810
Uh, when will you be back?

25:13.878 --> 25:17.247
Soon, Jacob.
Very soon.

25:29.961 --> 25:31.027
Morning, boys.

25:31.095 --> 25:33.196
What are you doing he,
shopping for gas?

25:33.263 --> 25:35.031
No, we're shopping
for a ride.

25:35.099 --> 25:37.601
See the guy in the overalls?
He owns the joint.

25:37.668 --> 25:39.136
So I called in a big
fuel order, right?

25:39.161 --> 25:40.361
He's says no, I'm tapped out.

25:40.386 --> 25:42.507
Says his whole supply's
on the road by 9am.

25:42.607 --> 25:44.175
That
plus the flag on the wall

25:44.243 --> 25:45.610
and the antique
rifle collection --

25:45.678 --> 25:47.479
I'd say that truck is headed
for the compound.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.181
I guess
dumping the fuel worked.

25:49.249 --> 25:54.587
Well, if that's my trojan horse,
I'd better saddle up.

25:54.655 --> 25:56.922
Listen, Fi, once you're inside,
no unnecessary risks.

25:56.990 --> 25:59.392
The driver's gonna take you
right into the compound.

25:59.460 --> 26:01.227
Find a place to hide, and wait until dark.
Okay.

26:01.295 --> 26:03.696
I just need to know
where they're keeping Tommy.

26:03.764 --> 26:05.264
I'm handling that
right now.

26:10.203 --> 26:11.270
Denise.

26:11.338 --> 26:12.905
No, John, it's Michael.

26:12.973 --> 26:15.808
Why do you have Denise's phone?

26:15.876 --> 26:17.476
Because you wouldn't
take my call.

26:17.544 --> 26:19.078
Yeah, 'cause I'm done
talking to you.

26:19.146 --> 26:20.813
Now, what's gonna make you stop,
a bullet?

26:20.880 --> 26:23.615
I'm not stopping until I know
where you're holding Tommy.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.050
No. I'm hanging up.

26:25.118 --> 26:26.752
No, John, just listen.

26:26.819 --> 26:29.421
Tell me where you got Tommy
so I know he's okay.

26:29.489 --> 26:31.857
Tommy is with me, okay?

26:31.925 --> 26:32.825
He's safe.

26:32.893 --> 26:34.293
Not good enough, John.

26:34.361 --> 26:35.594
How's his breathing?

26:35.662 --> 26:38.397
You set up a filtration system
in his room, right?

26:38.465 --> 26:40.666
No, I didn't know I was
suppose to set up a --

26:40.734 --> 26:43.402
Damn it, John, are you gonna
take this seriously or not?

26:43.470 --> 26:44.971
I need to tell them
you're doing all you can,

26:45.038 --> 26:46.372
or they'll take Tommy.

26:46.440 --> 26:49.409
At least tell me you covered
the windows with trash bags.

26:49.476 --> 26:51.477
What the hell
are you talking about?

26:51.545 --> 26:53.580
To keep out anything that would
provoke an asthma attack.

26:55.616 --> 26:58.651
Yeah. I can do that.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.686
Okay, great.
Thank you, John.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.089
They'll be holding Tommy
in the building

27:04.156 --> 27:05.857
with trash bags
covering the windows.

27:05.925 --> 27:06.991
Fi, you don't have to do this.
I could --

27:07.059 --> 27:08.126
Oh, please.

27:08.193 --> 27:09.661
You'll stick out
like Sam's chin.

27:09.728 --> 27:12.530
Besides, I've been wanting to
take a ride out to the country

27:12.598 --> 27:13.364
on the bottom of a truck
for weeks.

27:18.872 --> 27:22.108
<i>Tricking an enemy into letting</i>
<i>you inside their stronghold</i>

27:22.176 --> 27:24.678
<i>is a strategy as old</i>
<i>as the ancient Greeks.</i>

27:24.745 --> 27:27.848
<i>But you don't always need to</i>
<i>build a large wooden horse.</i>

27:27.916 --> 27:31.319
<i>With a modified special-purpose</i>
<i>insertion/extraction harness,</i>

27:31.387 --> 27:33.588
<i>you can hitch a ride</i>
<i>under a vehicle...</i>

27:33.655 --> 27:37.325
<i>And go right</i>
<i>through the front door.</i>

27:39.728 --> 27:41.195
Hey.
Hey.

27:41.263 --> 27:43.330
Fuel truck was
about five minutes behind us.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.100
They must've made
up some time.

27:47.168 --> 27:48.201
That sounds like
our girl.

27:58.814 --> 28:00.382
Just come home
in one piece.

28:00.449 --> 28:02.584
You're almost in view
of compound now.

28:06.189 --> 28:08.424
Hang on a second.
Why --

28:08.426 --> 28:10.927
what the hell
are those guys doing?

28:10.995 --> 28:12.162
And now the truck
is slowing down.

28:14.232 --> 28:16.333
Why is he checking
behind him?

28:16.401 --> 28:19.470
Fi, they know
you're on board.

28:19.538 --> 28:21.172
What?!
How could they know?

28:21.240 --> 28:22.607
I don't know how,
but they do.

28:22.675 --> 28:24.042
You got to get off
the truck now.

28:24.110 --> 28:25.343
That's why
the slowing down.

28:25.411 --> 28:26.511
Get off the truck now!

28:26.579 --> 28:28.847
Drop, Fi! Drop!

28:34.755 --> 28:36.088
Drop her!

28:38.725 --> 28:41.627
2:00! Over by the trees!

28:55.810 --> 28:57.477
Mike!

28:57.544 --> 28:59.412
She's pinned down! She's not
gonna make it the trees!

29:09.188 --> 29:10.684
She'll make it now!

29:10.709 --> 29:12.795
Everybody retreat.
Back to the compound!

29:13.425 --> 29:15.627
Move back!
Move back!

29:21.751 --> 29:23.751
They knew exactly where I was.

29:23.777 --> 29:24.978
How the hell
did that happen?

29:25.045 --> 29:26.446
Well, they didn't spot you
from the compound,

29:26.513 --> 29:27.613
and that truck
was barely in sight

29:27.681 --> 29:28.681
when the militia
rolled out.

29:28.749 --> 29:30.517
And you weren't made
at the gas station.

29:30.519 --> 29:31.984
The driver was told
you were on board.

29:32.052 --> 29:34.254
So then how?

29:34.322 --> 29:36.289
Wait minute, guys.
I think I know what happened.

29:36.357 --> 29:37.990
Check out
those satellite dishes.

29:38.058 --> 29:39.325
They've got signal-boosting
antennas.

29:39.393 --> 29:40.527
Yeah, and they're
all pointed too low.

29:40.594 --> 29:41.828
There's a cellphone tower
back that way.

29:41.896 --> 29:42.996
I saw it
when I was driving in.

29:43.064 --> 29:44.565
Well, even if they picked up
cell traffic,

29:44.632 --> 29:46.366
they'd need specialized hardware
to decode the signal.

29:46.434 --> 29:47.935
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
they have it.

29:48.003 --> 29:51.071
My ATF buddy told me that,
in addition to stealing C-4,

29:51.139 --> 29:53.374
Zechariah was suspected of
stealing military technology.

29:53.442 --> 29:56.077
And they have our phone numbers
'cause Mike was calling in.

29:56.145 --> 29:57.145
So we're on a party line?

29:57.213 --> 29:58.914
Well, I guess
e turning phones off.

29:58.981 --> 30:00.215
Actually, not yet.

30:00.283 --> 30:01.883
We know Zechariah's
listening in,

30:01.951 --> 30:03.351
but he doesn't know
we know.

30:03.963 --> 30:04.946
So you want to
stage a phone call.

30:04.954 --> 30:07.355
Yeah, something that sells
Armageddon is coming their way

30:07.423 --> 30:08.857
if they don't act now
to destroy us.

30:08.924 --> 30:10.224
Okay, so we lure them out

30:10.292 --> 30:12.560
and just stroll past
their undefended gates?

30:13.895 --> 30:15.596
Okay. I'm in.
What do we need?

30:15.664 --> 30:17.665
Something that sells
a last stand.

30:17.732 --> 30:20.800
I think I passed
just the spot.

30:20.868 --> 30:23.770
<i>For as long as armies</i>
<i>have built fortification</i>

30:23.838 --> 30:26.006
<i>others have tried</i>
<i>to get past them.</i>

30:26.074 --> 30:28.642
<i>Siege warfare can involve</i>
<i>tunneling under,</i>

30:28.709 --> 30:31.045
<i>scaling over,</i>
<i>or smashing through walls.</i>

30:31.112 --> 30:32.779
<i>Once you're inside, though,</i>

30:32.847 --> 30:35.148
<i>you're dealing</i>
<i>with an entrenched enemy</i>

30:36.618 --> 30:38.919
<i>that's why</i>
<i>the most successful sieges</i>

30:38.987 --> 30:41.155
<i>often don't involve</i>
<i>attacking at all,</i>

30:41.223 --> 30:42.523
<i>but tricking your enemy</i>
<i>into coming out.</i>

30:44.627 --> 30:46.127
All right.

30:46.195 --> 30:48.162
I'd say that looks just like
a heavily defended ammo dump.

30:48.230 --> 30:49.464
- You ready?
- Yeah.

30:49.532 --> 30:51.399
Remember,
we got to sell this.

30:54.504 --> 30:56.705
Well, that sure as hell
didn't work!

30:56.773 --> 30:58.307
Ah, no kidding.
No kidding.

30:58.375 --> 31:00.109
We're still in one piece,
but barely.

31:00.177 --> 31:01.410
- What now?
- Now?

31:01.412 --> 31:03.679
Now we storm the compound,
we tear down the walls,

31:03.746 --> 31:05.347
and we paint
the ground red.

31:05.415 --> 31:07.516
- We don't have the forces we need.
- Not yet.

31:07.583 --> 31:08.917
But the cavalry's
on its way.

31:08.985 --> 31:10.752
I want every man
and every weapon we have

31:10.820 --> 31:13.188
inside that shed a half a klick
north of the compound.

31:13.256 --> 31:14.556
We're gonna dig in
and wait.

31:14.624 --> 31:16.758
In an hour,
we'll have the muscle we need

31:16.826 --> 31:19.728
to punch in
and massacre them all!

31:21.230 --> 31:23.064
Well, if <i>that</i> doesn't draw
them out of the compound,

31:23.132 --> 31:25.032
I don't know what will.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.367
Call everybody.

31:26.435 --> 31:28.836
We hit first
with superior firepower,

31:28.904 --> 31:30.537
no one survives.

31:30.605 --> 31:32.073
No one!

31:32.140 --> 31:34.541
Load up the trucks.
Grab everything you got.

31:34.609 --> 31:36.610
Come on.
Let's go, go, go!

31:41.115 --> 31:43.216
Well, looks like
they're bringing every piece

31:43.284 --> 31:44.785
of hardware they got.

31:44.853 --> 31:47.054
I see one guard left inside.

31:47.122 --> 31:49.724
Shouldn't be too tough.
Shall we?

32:25.460 --> 32:28.796
All right, Jesse, Fi,
pull him out back.

32:28.863 --> 32:30.030
Keep a lookout.

32:30.098 --> 32:31.699
Sam and I are gonna
go get Tommy.

32:31.701 --> 32:32.967
Let's go inside.

32:53.885 --> 32:56.046
I'll give you one chance
to drop your weapons,

32:56.071 --> 32:57.271
and surrender.

33:07.637 --> 33:08.637
We got a problem.

33:12.041 --> 33:15.343
It's not just
Tommy inside.

33:15.411 --> 33:17.178
I got to go in, alone.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.212
Okay,
but make it snappy.

33:18.280 --> 33:19.347
Once Zechariah realizes
he's been duped,

33:19.414 --> 33:20.448
he's gonna be out
r blood.

33:20.515 --> 33:22.850
And the ATF is already
on the way.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.018
Light 'em up!

33:35.262 --> 33:37.329
Hold it! Hold it!

33:37.397 --> 33:41.066
Surrender your weapons now!

33:41.134 --> 33:43.669
John? It's Michael.

33:44.971 --> 33:45.904
I'm coming in.

33:47.674 --> 33:49.208
You again?

33:49.276 --> 33:50.643
Just stay back!

33:50.711 --> 33:53.779
I'm not here
to hurt you, John.

33:53.847 --> 33:55.748
I just want to talk.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.951
Those bruises are fresh.

33:58.018 --> 33:59.118
What happened?

33:59.186 --> 34:00.587
Nothing!

34:00.654 --> 34:02.356
Just stay back.

34:02.423 --> 34:04.324
I am on your side.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.960
What happened?

34:08.027 --> 34:11.030
He beat you, didn't he?

34:11.098 --> 34:14.167
He order everybody
out into the field,

34:14.234 --> 34:17.536
and Tommy couldn't breathe,
so I-I wouldn't go,

34:17.603 --> 34:19.772
and, uh, yeah, he beat me.
He broke my leg.

34:19.840 --> 34:23.542
Then Tommy got so scared,
he passed out.

34:23.610 --> 34:24.577
Hey!

34:24.643 --> 34:26.344
Stop!

34:26.413 --> 34:28.414
I said to stay back!

34:28.482 --> 34:30.181
Look around John.

34:30.250 --> 34:33.518
This isn't
what you signed up for.

34:33.587 --> 34:35.688
This isn't right.

34:41.128 --> 34:42.328
Well, what do you want?

34:42.829 --> 34:44.763
The same thing I wanted
when we first met --

34:44.831 --> 34:45.897
to keep your son safe.

34:45.965 --> 34:48.132
And he's not safe here,
John.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.400
He's not safe
with Zechariah.

34:50.469 --> 34:54.138
Zechariah promised
he'd protect us.

34:54.205 --> 34:55.873
Well, he lied to you
about that.

34:55.940 --> 34:58.041
He's not you, John.
He's not your brother.

34:58.109 --> 34:59.543
I mean,
think about your son.

34:59.610 --> 35:01.077
I <i>am thinking about him!</i>

35:01.145 --> 35:02.979
I'm his father!

35:03.047 --> 35:05.816
And as his father,
you have to make a choice.

35:05.884 --> 35:08.719
If you think it's better
for Tommy to shoot me,

35:08.787 --> 35:10.421
then you need to shoot me.

35:10.489 --> 35:13.958
But if you think Tommy is
better off leaving this place,

35:14.025 --> 35:16.827
then we need to get him
out of here right now.

35:32.477 --> 35:33.511
So stupid!

35:34.847 --> 35:37.849
I believed in that man.

35:37.917 --> 35:39.818
The radio.

35:39.885 --> 35:42.620
Radio!

35:42.688 --> 35:45.256
Snyder! Snyder!

35:45.324 --> 35:47.158
Do you copy?!
Come back!

35:51.931 --> 35:54.866
There are many things in
this world to believe in, John.

35:59.271 --> 36:01.706
Zechariah is not
one of them.

36:01.774 --> 36:04.109
Son of a bitch.

36:13.987 --> 36:17.490
You need to grab your son,
we need to go now.

36:17.557 --> 36:19.729
No.

36:19.730 --> 36:20.856
John, what are you talking about?

36:20.881 --> 36:21.861
You just said yourself
Zechariah isn't going --

36:21.862 --> 36:24.964
No, look. I-I'm done with him.
All right?

36:25.032 --> 36:27.032
But somebody's
got to stay back

36:27.100 --> 36:28.835
and --
and cover your escape.

36:28.903 --> 36:29.936
John, listen.

36:30.004 --> 36:31.204
Don't worry.

36:31.271 --> 36:33.039
I'm not gonna leave
my son fatherless.

36:33.107 --> 36:35.741
Get out of here.

36:35.809 --> 36:37.410
Hey.

36:37.478 --> 36:38.878
Hey, pal.

36:38.946 --> 36:41.581
Hey.

36:41.649 --> 36:42.816
Dad?

36:42.883 --> 36:45.652
Hey.

36:45.720 --> 36:49.922
So, you're gonna go
with this man here.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.457
And, uh...

36:51.525 --> 36:55.896
I just want you to know
that everything I do,

36:55.963 --> 36:57.298
I do for you.

37:00.302 --> 37:01.535
Love you, buddy.

37:06.108 --> 37:08.710
You just tell your mom
that I love her, too.

37:08.777 --> 37:10.945
Okay?

37:30.901 --> 37:33.470
I wish I could find
the words. I...

37:33.538 --> 37:34.771
You don't have to
say anything.

37:34.839 --> 37:35.806
I'm just glad
he's back with you.

37:37.709 --> 37:39.844
If only John's brother
hadn't died,

37:39.912 --> 37:42.380
maybe John would have taken
a different path.

37:42.448 --> 37:43.614
Things happen, honey.

37:43.682 --> 37:45.350
You can't always control
the way life goes.

37:45.417 --> 37:46.751
Could have been
a lot worse.

37:46.819 --> 37:48.652
It's a miracle he got out
of the compound.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.354
He's checked himself
into a hospital.

37:50.422 --> 37:51.456
He's gonna be okay.

37:51.523 --> 37:54.325
And, um,
the rest of them?

37:54.393 --> 37:55.793
ATF has rounded up
most of them.

37:55.861 --> 37:58.162
Zechariah's gonna spend a lot
of time in prison.

37:59.606 --> 38:00.806
So, what now?

38:01.033 --> 38:02.267
I have family Georgia.

38:02.334 --> 38:03.902
I was thinking of moving there
with Tommy.

38:03.969 --> 38:05.136
Think it'd be good
for him.

38:05.204 --> 38:07.339
You both deserve
a fresh start.

38:07.407 --> 38:09.608
I never got away
from <i>my</i> husband.

38:09.676 --> 38:11.611
I always regretted that.

38:14.181 --> 38:16.216
It's incredible what you did,
Michael --

38:16.284 --> 38:17.718
getting through to John.

38:17.786 --> 38:20.654
Your mom told me
about your dad.

38:20.722 --> 38:23.757
I know how hard this was
for you.

38:23.825 --> 38:25.659
I-I keep thinking about Tommy.

38:25.727 --> 38:27.094
He's gonna be okay.

38:29.030 --> 38:30.464
How do you know?

38:30.532 --> 38:33.600
He has a mom that loves him.
He'll be fine.

38:40.255 --> 38:41.522
I just want to go.

38:41.590 --> 38:43.357
Once we know where
your former boss wants to meet

38:43.425 --> 38:45.760
and that he doesn't need
to talk to you on the phone,

38:45.828 --> 38:46.994
then you'll be free
to go.

38:47.862 --> 38:49.596
I got to say,
it's lucky you look like me

38:49.664 --> 38:50.797
and go to the meeting
in my place.

38:50.865 --> 38:52.098
I wouldn't call
it lucky.

38:52.166 --> 38:53.433
Well, alls I'm saying is,

38:53.501 --> 38:55.034
I don't want to meet the guy
who wants me dead.

38:55.102 --> 38:56.636
It's a Text.

38:56.703 --> 38:59.905
From him.
Oh, thank God!

38:59.973 --> 39:01.307
Now can I go?

39:01.374 --> 39:04.110
"Hurricane Cove Marina,
slip 237, 1:00 p.m.

39:04.178 --> 39:06.546
Don't be late."
<i>Now</i> you're free to go.

39:06.613 --> 39:09.015
Hey, uh, next time you get
a job offer over the Internet,

39:09.082 --> 39:10.516
you might want to ask
a few questions

39:10.584 --> 39:11.684
before you just say "Yes".

39:11.752 --> 39:13.720
Okay. Thanks.

39:13.787 --> 39:16.922
Hey, I know you need my clothes
to go pretend to be me,

39:16.990 --> 39:18.557
but when you're finished,

39:18.625 --> 39:21.026
I was wondering
if I could get them back.

39:21.028 --> 39:22.494
No.

39:22.562 --> 39:24.763
You know what?
Never mind.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.600
Bye, Mr. Pickles.

39:34.272 --> 39:35.439
Not loving this, Mike.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.174
The guy shot and killed
a CIA officer.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.576
He could be anywhere around here
with a sniper rifle

39:39.644 --> 39:41.211
looking to do
the same to you.

39:41.279 --> 39:42.779
No, if he's trying
to kill Jacob,

39:42.847 --> 39:44.581
he'll make it look like
an accident.

39:44.649 --> 39:47.285
My guess is there's a reason
he wants to meet on the boat.

39:47.353 --> 39:49.354
So you think he's planning
to kill the guy,

39:49.422 --> 39:50.789
sail out,
and dump the body?

39:50.791 --> 39:52.057
Sounds about right.

39:52.125 --> 39:54.026
Yeah, like I said,
not loving this .

39:54.094 --> 39:56.296
But I'll be on Bluetooth
if you need me.

40:18.752 --> 40:21.287
You see anybody, Mike?

40:21.355 --> 40:23.823
No, there's no one
on board.

40:27.661 --> 40:29.529
Jacob just got a text.

40:29.597 --> 40:30.930
"Can't make it.

40:30.998 --> 40:32.465
"Take the boat.

40:32.533 --> 40:35.902
Meet me in the Bahamas
at Marsh Harbor."

40:35.970 --> 40:37.037
Marsh Harbor?

40:39.741 --> 40:42.543
Yeah, the guy was even nice
enough to leave Jacob a map

40:42.610 --> 40:44.178
showing him
how to get there.

40:44.246 --> 40:46.046
Well, that was sure decent
of him.

40:46.114 --> 40:47.180
What kind of game
is this guy playing?

40:49.551 --> 40:52.352
The kind that goes "boom."

40:52.420 --> 40:53.887
Just found a bomb.

40:53.955 --> 40:57.491
We got four pounds of C-4
wired to a trigger mechanism

40:57.558 --> 40:59.693
wired to a depth finder.

40:59.761 --> 41:01.595
So when the boat gets into water
that's deep enough, kaboom?

41:01.663 --> 41:03.897
Only thing better
than killing Jacob in person

41:03.965 --> 41:06.066
is killing him
when you're not even there.

41:06.134 --> 41:07.462
I'm sending you a picture
of the bomb.

41:08.825 --> 41:09.958
Get off that death trap, Mike.

41:09.993 --> 41:11.460
We'll find this guy
some other way.

41:11.527 --> 41:14.096
No, I don't want to spook him
and send him into hiding.

41:14.163 --> 41:16.031
Let's let him think
he killed Jacob.

41:16.099 --> 41:17.566
I'll see you
in a minute, Sam.

41:49.865 --> 41:51.933
Well, this puppy wasn't made
by an amateur.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.167
Look at that trigger.

41:53.235 --> 41:54.335

Definitely a pro.

41:54.403 --> 41:55.770
Well,

41:55.837 --> 41:58.172

42:03.213 --> 42:05.815
I'll show this to Fi.
She'll know where to start.

42:05.882 --> 42:08.618

We just need to it

42:11.255 --> 42:14.325
before the CIA comes after me

42:14.393 --> 42:16.227
