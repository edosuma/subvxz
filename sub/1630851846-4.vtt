00:04.091 --> 00:06.049
Mr. Gordon,
what's the difference

00:06.093 --> 00:07.877
between "assets"
and "equity?"

00:07.920 --> 00:10.140
I have a question for you,
Steve...

00:10.184 --> 00:13.361
Do you know summer break
starts tomorrow?

00:13.404 --> 00:17.017
Check out what I got
in my textbook.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.497
Baaaaabes!

00:19.541 --> 00:22.935
Pretty hot for a dead lady...

00:22.979 --> 00:25.199
or monster?

00:25.242 --> 00:28.115
W-Where does
one get... that?

00:28.158 --> 00:30.726
From my big brother, Big Billy.

00:30.769 --> 00:32.945
Dr. Kalgary
made you a brother?

00:35.948 --> 00:39.735
Check out this R-rated movie,
little bro!

00:40.779 --> 00:42.520
Oh, yeahhhh.

00:42.564 --> 00:45.175
Pope on Pope action!

00:45.219 --> 00:47.308
Well, my big brother
took me to Chimdale

00:47.351 --> 00:49.353
to buy throwing stars.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.661
No fair!

00:52.704 --> 00:54.465
All these big brothers are
introducing people to cool,

00:54.489 --> 00:56.404
new stuff, but I don't have one.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.319
Sucks to be you, kid.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.756
My big brother's so rad.

01:00.799 --> 01:03.498
He's 68,
and all his prostate exams

01:03.541 --> 01:05.413

01:06.457 --> 01:09.243

My life is lame and boring
'cause I don't have

01:48.412 --> 01:50.806
a big brother
to introduce me to cool stuff.

01:50.849 --> 01:53.243
Well, you already
have a brother... Jeff.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.202
Jeff's just my brother-in-law.

01:55.245 --> 01:57.552
Exactly.
You love the law.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.989
You're always calling the cops
to snitch on our neighbors.

02:00.032 --> 02:01.295
They're running a meth lab!

02:01.338 --> 02:03.427
Spend some time with Jeff.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.255
Trust me, he can show you
some stuff.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.127
If you're talking about
that acorn he thinks

02:07.170 --> 02:08.606
is a buffalo's toenail,

02:08.650 --> 02:10.478
he's shown me.

02:10.521 --> 02:15.091
Emergency family meeting
in three, two, one.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.049
I-I just got the mail,

02:17.093 --> 02:19.530
and I've won... a coupon!

02:19.574 --> 02:22.446
30% off for an escape room!

02:22.490 --> 02:24.840
It's such an insane deal
my hands are shaking!

02:24.883 --> 02:28.235
Nope.
Jeff beats escape room.

02:28.278 --> 02:32.108
Aw, man. I'm gonna get so many
chicks at this escape room.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.676
Klaus, do you have any idea
what an escape room is?

02:34.719 --> 02:37.722
No way, man. No clue.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.162
This is so cool.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.338
Nobody's ever asked me
to be their brother.

02:44.381 --> 02:47.732
It's not really a thing
that happens all that often.

02:47.776 --> 02:50.561
Hayley's not my sister now,
though, right?

02:50.605 --> 02:51.997
Jeff, focus.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.434
I need you to show me the world,

02:53.477 --> 02:55.697
expand my horizons.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.265
Okay, you know how sometimes
the rest of the family

02:58.308 --> 03:00.528
is doing stuff
and I'm not around?

03:00.571 --> 03:03.792
It's because
I'm looking at this wall.

03:05.924 --> 03:10.015
If you look close enough,
you can see a little face.

03:10.059 --> 03:12.235
I call him Colonel Forbin.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.501
Big brother advice...

03:17.545 --> 03:20.635
These guys are legally required
to give you

03:20.678 --> 03:22.419
as many free samples
as you want.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.421
That is not at all true.

03:24.465 --> 03:27.207
Whoops.
Darn it all!

03:27.250 --> 03:30.514
I'll help you out by throwing
these away at my house.

03:37.478 --> 03:40.002
- Look, I found another one!
- Wow.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.612
And yet your clothes
are always rumpled.

03:41.656 --> 03:44.267
You can use these things
on clothes?

03:48.445 --> 03:50.621
Slack slack, slack slack.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.710
Ducks say "slack" now?

04:02.329 --> 04:04.331
What are we doing?!
This is madness!

04:04.374 --> 04:07.551
Ducks say "what are we doing,
this is madness" now?

04:11.294 --> 04:16.647
Welcome to The Terrifying
Asylum of Dr. Insane-o.

04:16.691 --> 04:22.000
Unlike other escape rooms, you
can take all the time you need.

04:22.044 --> 04:24.046
We'll do it in half that time.

04:26.091 --> 04:27.397
Pssst.

04:27.441 --> 04:30.095
Now I am a guard at this asylum,

04:30.139 --> 04:33.795
where Dr. Insane-o,
the demented scientist,

04:33.838 --> 04:37.799
performs unspeakable experiments
on the inmates...

04:37.842 --> 04:39.409
you.

04:39.453 --> 04:42.325
I am so embarrassed for you
right now

04:42.369 --> 04:43.500
that you have to do this.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.067
The Doctor is out shopping

04:45.110 --> 04:48.113
for new torture devices
to use on you,

04:48.157 --> 04:52.683
unless you figure out
how to escape before he returns.

04:52.727 --> 04:55.817
So you're, like, an asylum guard
with a conscience or something?

04:55.860 --> 04:57.820
You're... You're helping us out?
I-I don't get it.

05:00.038 --> 05:01.388
I know how to escape!

05:01.431 --> 05:03.868
Follow her!

05:03.912 --> 05:06.088
It's locked!

05:06.131 --> 05:08.133
Oh, God, they've thought
of everything!

05:10.745 --> 05:13.356
This isn't working out.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.315
I don't think
we're compatible as brothers.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.055
Oh.

05:17.099 --> 05:18.709
I'll take you home
as soon as we hang out

05:18.753 --> 05:20.798
in this parking lot
for a few hours.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.583

06:06.366 --> 06:09.499
I used my brain

06:09.543 --> 06:11.283
You did it.

06:11.327 --> 06:14.243

Now that we're brothers, I feel
like I can tell you anything.

06:25.472 --> 06:29.084
When I was little, I saw a man
stabbing his family

06:29.127 --> 06:31.478
at a rest stop,
and I pretended not to notice.

06:31.521 --> 06:32.870
Shhhhhhhh.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.306
Let's just savor this moment.

here's my super secret tip

06:42.271 --> 06:44.665
to grilled cheese perfection...

totally melted cheese.

Whoa!

06:49.887 --> 06:52.542
Ohh-ohh!

06:52.586 --> 06:55.023
Hey, Cheese, who's your bud?

06:55.066 --> 06:58.243
Mars, meet my little brother,
Steve.

06:58.287 --> 07:01.769
Your brother makes the best
grilled cheese on Shakedown!

07:01.812 --> 07:06.556
Like a cheddar Michelangelo

07:06.600 --> 07:09.690

- Are you...

07:09.733 --> 07:11.518
NBA Hall of Famer

07:11.561 --> 07:13.041
Phish-head, Bill Walton?

07:13.084 --> 07:14.956
Yes, I am.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.784
I was gonna say
"in constant back pain

07:16.827 --> 07:18.960
from your height and posture,"
but that's cool.

07:19.003 --> 07:21.789
I love these things, even
though my heart doctor tells me

07:21.832 --> 07:24.531
that eating even one of them
will take years off my life.

07:26.184 --> 07:27.795
Who's the new kid?

07:27.838 --> 07:30.058
It's Cheese's little brother,
dude.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.712
A little Cheese?!

07:31.755 --> 07:32.756
"Little Cheese."

07:32.800 --> 07:34.323
I like it.

07:34.366 --> 07:35.977
Jim!

07:36.020 --> 07:37.805
Good to see you, too, boy!

07:37.848 --> 07:42.113
That's Runaway Jim, a stray dog
who follows Phish on tour.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.681
Jim doesn't like
anyone but Cheese.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.511
He's actually kind of a dick.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.339
Uh-oh, we got another stray dog.

Don't confuse them

08:02.046 --> 08:06.268
Those are non-feral non-hippies

08:06.311 --> 08:08.879
What's she doing?

08:08.923 --> 08:11.012
The finger means she's looking

08:11.055 --> 08:12.666
a free ticket.

08:12.709 --> 08:15.538
I'd give her mine,
but then I'd need a miracle,

09:19.776 --> 09:22.257
Ooh, so is this bloody table.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.041
Maybe we should relax a bit.

09:24.085 --> 09:27.175
Ever since I won that coupon,
it's been go, go, go.

09:27.218 --> 09:28.611
Why are we in such a rush?

09:28.655 --> 09:30.395
Let's enjoy where we are.

09:32.049 --> 09:34.138
<i>Stuck on the beaker puzzle?</i>

09:34.182 --> 09:36.010
How about a hint?

09:36.053 --> 09:37.533
We paid to get in here.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.274
Why are you so focused
on getting us out?

09:39.317 --> 09:41.232
<i>Because it's an escape room.</i>

09:41.276 --> 09:42.625
We <i>are</i> escaping.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.714
From our humdrum
furniture at home.

09:50.372 --> 09:54.115
So, what'd you think of your
first Phish show, Little Cheese?

09:54.158 --> 09:56.770
Well, I didn't enjoy it
as much as that girl on molly

09:56.813 --> 09:58.859
who kept trying
to kiss the music.

09:58.902 --> 10:01.470
But I'm in love
with Shakedown Street.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.081
Oh! Wha... What's that?

10:04.125 --> 10:06.431
That's the hiss of
the Nitrous Mafia,

10:06.475 --> 10:08.303
a violent drug gang
that controls

10:08.346 --> 10:11.001
the sale
of nitrous oxide balloons.

10:14.439 --> 10:17.529
Even rainbows have shadows.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.314
I don't know if that's true.

10:19.357 --> 10:22.839
The Nitrous Mafia is here
for money, not music.

10:22.883 --> 10:26.321
And they force small mom-and-pop
nitrous dealers out of business.

10:30.107 --> 10:32.022
Promise me you'll stay away
from them.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.894
Fine. I promise.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.809
Well, it's time to go anyway.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.121
What if we don't go home?

10:44.165 --> 10:46.733
What if we follow the band
on tour?

10:46.776 --> 10:48.691
I don't know
if I could pretend to be a duck

10:48.735 --> 10:50.345

10:50.388 --> 10:52.086
You wouldn't have to.

10:52.129 --> 10:55.480

how to invest "capital"

I'm in!

11:08.668 --> 11:10.147
I should probably tell Hayley

11:10.191 --> 11:12.149
I won't be back
for three months.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.585
But I can do that after.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.507
It's working, Steve.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.596
I've never seen
this many rumpled-up

11:24.640 --> 11:26.642
dollar bills in my life!

11:26.686 --> 11:29.253
Hooray for
the Grilled Cheese Brothers!

11:40.874 --> 11:42.919
I got a hot cheese for Moonbeam!

11:44.529 --> 11:47.228
We should start
taking last names.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.284
So, you goin' to Red Rocks?

12:00.328 --> 12:03.200
We're thinking about introducing
a four-cheese blend there,

12:03.244 --> 12:05.159
if that moves
the needle for you.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.780
Well, going on tour
was a dream come true.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.129
But now that it's over,

12:19.173 --> 12:21.175
I'll need to think
of new dreams.

12:21.218 --> 12:22.785
And new come trues.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.569
Grilled Cheese Bros!

12:24.613 --> 12:25.919
See you at the Phish festival?

12:25.962 --> 12:27.224
What festival?

12:27.268 --> 12:28.965
You gotta go, L.C.!

12:29.009 --> 12:30.837
Camping, artwork,

12:30.880 --> 12:34.014
80,000 people sharing
like 10 porta potties.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.407
Well, then, of course I'm going!

12:36.451 --> 12:38.235
Little Cheese, I love you, man!

12:38.279 --> 12:40.934
I'm starting to come down.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.197
Sorry, Little Cheese,
but festivals

12:43.240 --> 12:45.416
are way out of our price range.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.244
But Mars is going!
And Tela!

12:47.288 --> 12:48.942
And Bill Walton!

12:48.985 --> 12:51.640
Let's just go home
and do brother stuff there.

12:51.683 --> 12:54.817
Like wait for our parents to die
then fight over their money.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.602
Yeah, I guess we can't
afford the festival.

12:57.646 --> 12:58.821
That's the spirit!

13:11.181 --> 13:13.575
You suck at teeny tiny tennis.

13:13.618 --> 13:15.925
Big Daddy is the teeny tiny man.

13:15.969 --> 13:17.361
<i>ESCAPE ROOM LADY You have to try</i>

13:17.405 --> 13:19.059
<i>to escape the room.</i>

13:19.102 --> 13:20.712
<i>It's been</i> weeks.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.932
You said take as much time
as we need,

13:22.976 --> 13:24.934
and time we are taking.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.588
<i>I know you're
running out of food.</i>

13:26.631 --> 13:28.329
Fine.
Let's negotiate.

13:28.372 --> 13:30.766
Okay.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.333
What will it take
for you to leave...

13:32.376 --> 13:34.465
- Tom, now!
- Delivery!

13:34.509 --> 13:36.554
I'm more brilliant

13:36.598 --> 13:38.382
than Dr. Insane-o
himself.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.080
You'll never get us out.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.385
We're gonna die in here.

13:47.391 --> 13:48.958
I'm not gonna lie,

13:49.002 --> 13:52.048
I'm excited to get home
and start pooping indoors again.

13:52.092 --> 13:53.833
I know how to pay
for the festival.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.313
We'll franchise
Grilled Cheese Brothers.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.054
I got a loan from
the Nitrous Mafia to...

13:58.098 --> 13:59.839
Nitrous Mafia?!

13:59.882 --> 14:02.058
You made a brother promise
you'd stay away.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.320
Come on, Jeff.

14:03.364 --> 14:05.322
We're not really brothers.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.803
You and me having
the same unshakeable bond

14:07.847 --> 14:08.891
as Luke and Owen Wilson?

14:08.935 --> 14:09.892
Please.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.981
- Oh.
- Anyway,

14:12.025 --> 14:14.185
here's all the bread and cheese
I bought with the loan.

14:18.553 --> 14:21.164
Oh, crap, Wooks raided the van!

14:21.208 --> 14:23.384
The Nitrous Mafia's
gonna kill me

14:23.427 --> 14:24.559
if I don't pay them back!

14:24.602 --> 14:26.604
They were very specific
about that!

14:26.648 --> 14:29.694
Seems like you got yourself
into quite the predicament.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.392
H-How are
the Grilled Cheese Brothers

14:31.435 --> 14:32.784
gonna solve this one?

14:32.828 --> 14:35.570
Oh, so now we're brothers again?

14:35.613 --> 14:38.138
You mean that thing I said
about not being brothers?

14:38.181 --> 14:40.792
Brothers say mean stuff
to each other.

14:40.836 --> 14:41.924
Dick?

14:41.968 --> 14:43.143
You're right.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.580
I'll go talk to them.

14:46.798 --> 14:47.930
Phew.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.018
Jeff's got it covered.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.933
Aah!

14:56.112 --> 14:59.159
"We're keeping your brother
until he works off your debt."

14:59.202 --> 15:00.943
What have I done?!

15:11.084 --> 15:12.520
<i>♪ In the middle of the night</i>

15:12.563 --> 15:14.914
Hello, fellow fan.
Why so blue?

15:14.957 --> 15:17.220
The Nitrous Mafia
is forcing Jeff

15:17.264 --> 15:20.832
to sell nitrous at the festival
until he pays off my debt.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.617
Harsh toke.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.575
- Am I using that right?
- Kind of.

15:24.619 --> 15:27.970
Well, I'm goin'
if you want a lift.

15:28.014 --> 15:31.539
Not in a million years, custie!

15:32.801 --> 15:34.107
Yes, thank you so much.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.562
You think you're better
than everyone else

15:35.586 --> 15:37.414
with your fancy R.V.?!

15:37.458 --> 15:40.287
You are.
This is exquisite.

15:47.903 --> 15:51.994
Usually the Nitrous Mafia
sells gas in the parking lot.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.129
But today we're all
selling gas...

15:58.000 --> 16:00.960
...inside
the concert venue.

16:01.003 --> 16:04.267
How about I hang back and
tie-dye the gang's sweatpants?

16:04.311 --> 16:06.008
How about you...

16:07.314 --> 16:09.011
...get me my money?!

16:09.055 --> 16:11.057
So how are we getting

16:11.100 --> 16:13.015
the nitrous tanks
past security, boss?

16:13.059 --> 16:15.278
Who said anything about...

16:16.497 --> 16:17.715
...tanks?

16:23.373 --> 16:25.941
Now I get what
the mean nitrous man meant

16:25.985 --> 16:28.509
when he said, "Who said
anything about tanks?"

16:28.552 --> 16:30.380
It was actually pretty clever.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.776
I just want to check in, Stan.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.473
You're really sticking on 11?

16:36.517 --> 16:38.780
- Like glue, my man.
- Hello.

16:38.823 --> 16:41.217
Thanks, I'll take an 18-year
Macallan on the rocks.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.958
We haven't been able

16:43.002 --> 16:44.916
to book this room for a month.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.135
We're closing.

16:46.179 --> 16:48.442
A server farm is
taking over our lease.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.143
Don't bite on this, gang.

16:54.187 --> 16:56.450
It's classic Insane-o trickery.

16:56.493 --> 17:00.628
You do realize there is
no Dr. Insane-o, right?

17:00.671 --> 17:02.108
But there <i>is</i> an Ernie.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.413
He's VP of tech.

17:03.457 --> 17:06.242
You'll liaise with him
from now on.

17:10.725 --> 17:13.989
So ...nie's bringing
my Macallan, then?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.817
Ooh, it's getting
kinda hot in here.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.514
I'll tell you who's sweatin'...

17:17.558 --> 17:18.950
Dr. Insane-o.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.169
This is so desperate.

17:25.174 --> 17:26.436
We'll take that hint now!

17:26.480 --> 17:29.091
Come on,
we're gonna die in here!

17:29.135 --> 17:31.175
<i>ESCAPE ROOM LADY
Isn't that
what you said you wanted?</i>

17:34.053 --> 17:36.098
Don't you see, Stan?

17:36.142 --> 17:40.798
The Escape Room Lady... <i>
she's</i> Dr. Insane-o.

17:42.235 --> 17:43.410
<i>Twilight Zone</i> moment!

17:48.197 --> 17:49.894
Festivals are so neat.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.026
Shut up, Custie!

17:51.070 --> 17:52.419
I gotta find Jeff before

17:52.462 --> 17:54.116
he's arrested for
selling balloons!

17:56.771 --> 17:59.469
Oh, man, if I get caught
with all this nitrous,

17:59.513 --> 18:00.905
I'm so screwed!

18:03.821 --> 18:04.821
Hold up!

18:06.955 --> 18:08.174
You lost a little air.

18:08.217 --> 18:09.740
Let me top you off.

18:09.784 --> 18:12.091
I'm a cool security guard.

18:19.446 --> 18:23.189
Weird, no one down there's
selling nitrous balloons.

18:23.232 --> 18:26.540
<i>Weirder,</i> buncha people
wearing Plokémon suits.

18:30.065 --> 18:32.763
The Nitrous Mafia aren't
selling balloons.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.939
They <i>are</i> the balloons.

18:36.550 --> 18:40.162
But which one's Jeff?

18:40.206 --> 18:41.946
Runaway Jim!

18:41.990 --> 18:43.948
He's only horny for Jeff's leg.

18:43.992 --> 18:45.036
So that must be Jeff.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.516
Shut up, Custie!

18:46.560 --> 18:47.952
Not now, Jim!

18:47.996 --> 18:49.911
I don't want you mixed up
in all this.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.399
Jeff!

18:59.442 --> 19:01.203
We gotta get you out of here
before you get arrested.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.620
Not until I pay back
the Nitrous Mafia

19:03.664 --> 19:05.032
or we'll be looking
over our shoulder

19:05.056 --> 19:06.841
for the rest of our lives!

19:06.884 --> 19:09.800
Then let's bust 'em right now.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.891
Officers!
Everyone wearing

19:13.935 --> 19:15.893
a Plokémon suit
is a nitrous dealer.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.634
You gotta catch 'em all!

19:20.811 --> 19:23.249
Oh, yeah.
That's the <i>real</i> deal.

19:25.251 --> 19:26.904
Freeze, Plokémen!

19:26.948 --> 19:28.602
We know you're all
made of drugs!

19:30.865 --> 19:32.258
Nitrous Mafia!

19:32.301 --> 19:34.651
Initiate helium escape protocol!

19:40.396 --> 19:43.094
The Nitrous Mafia's
getting away!

19:43.138 --> 19:45.314
Phish fans unite!

19:48.491 --> 19:52.408
Right. Phish fans don't own
any sharp stuff.

19:54.497 --> 19:57.892
Ah. The only thing
that can stop the Mafia now

19:57.935 --> 19:59.589
is a miracle.

19:59.633 --> 20:05.987
A miracle!

20:16.258 --> 20:17.564
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

20:17.607 --> 20:19.914
Yeah!

20:19.957 --> 20:22.221
I was wrong about you,
Big Cheese.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.266
Only a real big brother
would risk himself

20:24.310 --> 20:26.747
to help his dumb little brother
out of trouble.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.139
Thanks, Little Cheese.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.140
Let's go home.

20:29.184 --> 20:30.881
Orrrrr...

20:30.925 --> 20:33.580
should us brothers
split the acid

20:33.623 --> 20:35.886
I've been saving
in my pocket all tour?

20:35.930 --> 20:38.193
That's all you, big bro.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.414
Good, 'cause I already
took both doses

20:41.457 --> 20:45.069
and I'm banana monkey
bingo foot.

20:45.113 --> 20:48.421
May I have this darnce,
Madam Eucalyptus?

20:56.472 --> 20:58.474
Bye-bye!
See you soon!
