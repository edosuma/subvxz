WEBVTT

00:07.640 --> 00:08.902
Spacecataz.

00:10.076 --> 00:12.442
You know, we have time.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.413
You really need us
to go to warp speed?

00:14.447 --> 00:17.143
Yes, I want everyone
to know I'm fast...

00:17.183 --> 00:19.708
and I will tear ass
all over their galaxy...

00:19.753 --> 00:21.812
and totally trench their galaxy!

00:21.855 --> 00:23.652
All right,
wh-whatever you say.

00:27.827 --> 00:31.092
Boy, we are...
Oh, no, he did not do that!

00:31.131 --> 00:32.119
What? What's...

00:32.165 --> 00:34.224
That dude back there
just flipped me off!

00:34.267 --> 00:35.757
Really, you saw that?

00:35.802 --> 00:36.826
Did he see you?

00:36.870 --> 00:38.030
Oh, yes, sir.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.265
Stop this ship!

00:39.305 --> 00:42.274
OK. You know what
always happens, though.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.400
- Oh!
- Ow!

00:45.412 --> 00:48.074
My name is Shake-zula

00:48.114 --> 00:49.274
The mike ruler

00:49.315 --> 00:50.441
The old schooler

00:50.483 --> 00:51.541
You want to trip?

00:51.584 --> 00:52.778
I'll bring it to ya

00:52.819 --> 00:54.650
Frylock and I'm on top

00:54.687 --> 00:55.676
Rock you like a cop

00:55.722 --> 00:56.984
Meatwad, you're up next

00:57.023 --> 00:58.581
With your knock-knock

00:58.625 --> 01:00.650
Meatwad make the money, see?

01:00.693 --> 01:03.127
Meatwad get the honeys, G.

01:03.163 --> 01:04.596
Driving in my car

01:04.631 --> 01:06.064
Living like a star

01:06.099 --> 01:07.794
Ice on my fingers and my toes

01:07.834 --> 01:09.096
And I'm a Taurus

01:09.135 --> 01:11.626
Uh, check-check it, yeah

01:11.671 --> 01:14.037
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

01:14.074 --> 01:15.632
Make the homeys say ho

01:15.675 --> 01:17.370
And the girlies want to scream

01:17.410 --> 01:19.640
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

01:19.679 --> 01:20.839
Make the homeys say ho

01:20.880 --> 01:22.711
And the girlies want to scream

01:22.749 --> 01:24.979
Aqua Teen Hunger Force

01:25.018 --> 01:26.986
Number one in the hood, G.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.750
Welcome to Video Ouija.

01:29.789 --> 01:33.623
Spirits from this house...

01:33.660 --> 01:36.823
come out and play with me!

01:36.863 --> 01:38.330
What do you think,
you're running the Matrix?

01:38.364 --> 01:39.524
You're gonna break that thing.

01:39.566 --> 01:41.534
Shh! You're disturbing
the presence.

01:41.568 --> 01:42.660
Look, Shake,
he needs complete silence...

01:42.702 --> 01:44.067
so he can talk to the dead.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.334
Yeah? Well,
he needs a lack of oxygen...

01:46.372 --> 01:48.340
so he can become the dead.

01:48.374 --> 01:49.898
Has an intruder
entered the Ouija realm?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.535
- All right, scoot over.
- Shake, don't!

01:51.578 --> 01:53.102
- I control this now.
- Don't do that!

01:53.146 --> 01:54.340
No, no! You ain't
supposed to touch it!

01:54.380 --> 01:55.642
You're just supposed
to let your hand rest on it.

01:55.682 --> 01:57.411
I've got a smart bomb
locked onto this guy.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.474
Gonna blow him up!

02:02.522 --> 02:03.989
Frylock, he's touching it.

02:04.023 --> 02:05.012
All right, all right!

02:05.058 --> 02:07.288
You don't have to tell,
little baby!

02:07.327 --> 02:09.192
This is a piece of crap anyhow.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.789
In fact, I may destroy it.

02:11.831 --> 02:14.197
OK, Meatwad, time to put it up.
It's getting late.

02:14.234 --> 02:17.203
Come on, just one more
dead person, please?

02:17.237 --> 02:19.228
Just one more dead guy.

02:19.272 --> 02:20.466
All right, one more.

02:20.507 --> 02:24.807
Spirits that haunt
this house...

02:24.844 --> 02:27.404
tell me...

02:27.447 --> 02:29.779
what was we talking about?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.750
My sister's baby.

02:31.784 --> 02:32.876
Oh! Yeah, yeah.

02:32.919 --> 02:35.149
One of them other dead boys
told me about that.

02:35.188 --> 02:36.450
How's she doing?

02:36.489 --> 02:39.083
She's dead. We're all dead.

02:39.125 --> 02:41.593
Well, at least it had
all its fingers and toes...

02:41.628 --> 02:42.617
you know what I mean?

02:42.662 --> 02:44.960
Hey, Frylock!
Come back here quick!

02:44.998 --> 02:48.434
Check it out!
I'm screwing up his little game.

02:48.468 --> 02:49.992
Ha ha ha! Aagh!

02:50.036 --> 02:52.129
What are you doing?!
Wait! Stop! Shake!

02:52.172 --> 02:54.333
What do you think I'm doing?!

02:54.374 --> 02:56.569
I'm gonna get in
that little game of his...

02:56.609 --> 03:00.204
and then I'm gonna
so hose him... Ha ha ha!

03:00.246 --> 03:03.579
Till his heart stops!
Ha ha ha!

03:03.616 --> 03:06.881
See? And then...
and then I'm the winner.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.753
Well, you're
not gonna do it this way.

03:09.789 --> 03:11.723
You always take his side!

03:11.758 --> 03:13.692
I would say
"Don't ever talk to me again"...

03:13.726 --> 03:15.091
but I'm not talking to you...

03:15.128 --> 03:16.493
so there's
no point in saying it...

03:16.529 --> 03:19.293
because you're not even here.

03:19.332 --> 03:20.890
- Good night, Shake.
- Good night.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.027
Hey, Carl.

03:23.069 --> 03:24.331
Can I show you something
real quick?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.099
It, uh, it starts here...

03:26.139 --> 03:28.039
where I used to have
a full tank of gas.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.336
- Uh-huh.
- And, uh...

03:29.375 --> 03:31.741
Hey, what's bubbling
in the pool?

03:31.778 --> 03:33.905
Oh, my God!
What are those, piranhas?

03:33.947 --> 03:36.541
Well, yeah.
I mean, Shake's in there, too.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.780
You can't see him 'cause
he's in the piranhas, but...

03:39.819 --> 03:40.843
What?! Shake!

03:40.887 --> 03:42.582
No, no, no, no!
Fryman, back off!

03:42.622 --> 03:44.419
Them fish are still alive.

03:44.457 --> 03:46.721
They're just sort of,
you know, tired...

03:46.759 --> 03:48.818
from all them sleeping pills
Shake swallowed.

03:48.861 --> 03:50.453
Hey, did he want
to kill himself?

03:50.496 --> 03:52.293
Oh, my God... Is this a note?

03:52.332 --> 03:54.960
Friends, relations...

03:55.001 --> 03:56.935
whatever the hell Meatwad is...

03:56.970 --> 03:58.562
I've lived a full life.

03:58.605 --> 04:00.698
It's actually been...

04:00.740 --> 04:02.173
pretty bitchin'.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.199
But now, regrettably...

04:04.244 --> 04:06.303
my life has been taken.

04:06.346 --> 04:08.746
Please bury me
with all my stuff...

04:08.781 --> 04:10.976
because you know it's mine.

04:11.017 --> 04:14.817
Dearest Meatwad,
turn on that dumb game...

04:14.854 --> 04:17.982
'cause I'm gonna whale on you
from the grave, baby!

04:18.024 --> 04:19.423
Please stop! Stop it!

04:19.459 --> 04:21.324
Suck it up, mutha! Ha ha ha!

04:21.361 --> 04:22.760
No, don't! Don't!

04:22.795 --> 04:26.754
Missing you already, M.S.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.461
Fryman, I am so sorry...

04:32.505 --> 04:34.973
that I can't press charges here.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.305
Yeah, me, too.

04:37.543 --> 04:38.908
You know,
I can't help but notice...

04:38.945 --> 04:40.606
that you're trying
to leave right now.

04:40.647 --> 04:41.705
Any chance you were gonna...

04:41.748 --> 04:43.579
clean the Shake stew
out of my pool?

04:43.616 --> 04:44.947
No.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.475
OK. Watch your back.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.580
Hey, man,
you stole my wristwatch.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.318
You dumb!
I already have a wristwatch.

04:52.358 --> 04:53.484
You dumb.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.016
Burned!

04:55.061 --> 04:56.892
Yeah! Burned!

04:56.929 --> 04:58.226
I saw you looking at it.

04:58.264 --> 04:59.925
Yo mama, you did!

04:59.966 --> 05:01.297
Classic comeback!

05:01.334 --> 05:03.359
Yo mama! Yo mama!

05:03.403 --> 05:05.371
- Incineration!
- All right!

05:05.405 --> 05:06.929
You're the Insult Master!

05:06.973 --> 05:08.804
So, where's Video Ouija?

05:08.841 --> 05:10.240
I'm done with that game.

05:10.276 --> 05:12.073
I talked to that ghost
about his sister's baby...

05:12.111 --> 05:14.170
for like 3 hours. Boring.

05:14.213 --> 05:16.078
Well, maybe there's
someone else in there.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.582
Yeah, his sister's baby.

05:17.617 --> 05:20.848
All you get in there is,
"Wah, wah, wah!"

05:20.887 --> 05:22.218
For the ghost baby's cranky.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.018
Well, you never know.
Let's give it another shot, OK?

05:24.057 --> 05:26.719
Oh, I don't think you heard me.
I said no.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.161
Burned!
I'm the Insult Master!

05:31.197 --> 05:34.428
Meatwad, Master Shake is dead.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.627
That's cool.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.659
Shake?
Shake, are you in there?

05:37.704 --> 05:38.898
Why isn't he playing?!

05:38.938 --> 05:41.771
Get his ass out of bed
and get him on this thing.

05:41.808 --> 05:42.968
I hate to tell you this,
Shake...

05:43.009 --> 05:44.840
but he's kind of gotten tired
of Video Ouija.

05:44.877 --> 05:47.812
No! I went to great lengths
to do this!

05:47.847 --> 05:51.613
You get the hell
over there and force... Hold on.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.949
Shut up! Go find a nipple!

05:53.986 --> 05:55.544
Shake, will you stop?
You're just riling him up.

05:55.588 --> 05:57.579
- He's being a baby.
- He is a baby.

05:57.623 --> 06:00.353
And he still won't stop!

06:00.393 --> 06:03.055
Frylock, get me out of here.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.724
This place sucks ass!

06:05.765 --> 06:09.701
Well... well, Shake, I mean, I...

06:09.736 --> 06:10.964
What? What?!

06:11.003 --> 06:13.301
I can't just bring you
back to life. I mean...

06:13.339 --> 06:14.966
Come on, you can do it.

06:15.007 --> 06:17.567
You know...
you're like a math guy!

06:17.610 --> 06:18.838
I don't think that math...

06:18.878 --> 06:20.311
is gonna bring you back
from the dead.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.780
Well, what the hell is...
Oh, excuse me.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.282
Shut up!

06:24.317 --> 06:25.306
Hell, I don't know.

06:25.351 --> 06:26.477
Well, you better find out...

06:26.519 --> 06:28.111
'cause without me,
you're lost, buddy!

06:28.154 --> 06:30.645
I'm not good with kids!

06:30.690 --> 06:33.181
So... how is this pronounced?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.659
Billy.

06:34.694 --> 06:37.026
OK. Have you ever worked
with anything...

06:37.063 --> 06:38.257
any larger than a chicken?

06:38.297 --> 06:43.394
Billywitchdoctor. com
work mostly in chicken.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.597
Well, could
Billywitchdoctor. com...

06:45.638 --> 06:47.572
maybe raise something else
from the dead...

06:47.607 --> 06:48.733
bigger than a chicken?

06:48.775 --> 06:50.936
Mega-ultra-chicken?

06:50.977 --> 06:53.275
No! Shh! He is legend.

06:53.312 --> 06:54.711
Well, no, I mean,
I was thinking more...

06:54.747 --> 06:57.739
like a human... milk shake...

06:57.784 --> 06:58.978
or something like that.

06:59.018 --> 07:01.282
Ohh.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.810
Billywitchdoctor. com...

07:02.855 --> 07:06.291
feel more comfortable
with chicken.

07:06.325 --> 07:08.555
Just chickens, huh?
OK, and you're local.

07:08.594 --> 07:12.530
One convenient locations...

07:12.565 --> 07:13.691
in Africa.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.065
OK, well, we'll be in touch.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.627
I think we've found our man,
Frylock.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.036
'Cause look at this here.

07:20.072 --> 07:22.233
He done pulled this
out of my ear!

07:22.275 --> 07:24.209
Look at th... He did it again!

07:24.243 --> 07:25.767
Oh, hell!
Hey, hey, hey, Billy!

07:25.812 --> 07:26.801
Hey, Billy, wait!

07:26.846 --> 07:28.871
I want that boy
for my birthday party.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.645
So... why am I here?

07:31.684 --> 07:35.017
Well, Billywitchdoctor. com needs
a minimum of four people...

07:35.054 --> 07:36.385
to create a séance ring...

07:36.422 --> 07:37.650
so he can bring Shake
back from the dead.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.419
We're what?
We're bringing him back?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.653
Whoa, whoa!
Is that what we're doing here?

07:40.693 --> 07:42.888
Uh-uh! My ass we is!

07:42.929 --> 07:45.261
I ain't been hit all day.
I kind of like it.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.699
Please, please,
all together. Hold hands.

07:48.734 --> 07:50.258
No, no, no, no, no.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.668
Oh, no, no. No, sir.

07:51.704 --> 07:54.434
I don't know what kind of vibe
you think you got off me...

07:54.474 --> 07:57.307
but I don't play that way.
I'm not that way!

07:57.343 --> 07:58.435
Carl!

07:58.478 --> 08:00.503
I mean, I don't do both sides
of the field...

08:00.546 --> 08:03.413
offense or defense, you know,
with the short shorts, no.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.212
Carl, it's just a séance.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.242
It's not that way.
Come on, will you?

08:07.286 --> 08:10.346
Now, please,
kiss him deep with tongue.

08:10.389 --> 08:11.378
Do what?!

08:11.424 --> 08:13.449
Ho ho ho!

08:13.493 --> 08:16.018
Just kid.
Just kid, dirty boy.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.495
Touch hands.

08:19.866 --> 08:21.390
You boyfriend and boyfriend!

08:21.434 --> 08:23.595
Meatwad! Will you settle down?
This is serious!

08:23.636 --> 08:24.762
OK.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.328
Please, read from sheets.

08:26.372 --> 08:27.669
I Am...
