WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:05.380
[King] Luz, I'm so happy
I had you as a big sister.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.219
No! King!

00:21.438 --> 00:22.856
[cries]

00:29.738 --> 00:30.781
[door knocks]

00:32.282 --> 00:33.367
[gasps]

00:34.117 --> 00:36.537
Hey, Mom. I'm back.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.582
[both crying]

00:45.212 --> 00:47.047
[Camila humming]

00:49.132 --> 00:50.050
[gasps]

00:58.809 --> 01:03.021
Hey. Thanks for not telling
them that I'm...

01:03.021 --> 01:04.356
A Grimwalker?

01:04.356 --> 01:07.943
Shh! Don't say it so loud.

01:07.943 --> 01:12.155
[sighs] What about you?
How have you been since, uh--

01:12.155 --> 01:14.283
Since we were in Belos's mind?

01:14.283 --> 01:16.910
Since I found out
I helped him meet The Collector?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.579
Oh, my gosh, Hunter.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.330
They're all gonna hate me.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.625
What? Pshh.
No, of course they won't.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.502
They won't hate you
any more than me

01:25.502 --> 01:28.213
when they find out
that I might be a clone

01:28.213 --> 01:32.301
of someone
who was a witch-hunter

01:32.926 --> 01:34.511
with Belos.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.518
We'll tell them
when we're ready.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.648
Okay. So, in the Demon Realm,

01:46.648 --> 01:48.608
you fought
the evil Emperor Belos,

01:48.608 --> 01:50.402
who turned into a monster--

01:50.402 --> 01:52.362
Well, he started out human.

01:52.362 --> 01:57.242
Right. But he was defeated
by a newer, smaller bad guy?

01:57.242 --> 02:01.246
The Collector.
We don't know what he is
or how Belos found him.

02:01.246 --> 02:04.875
Who knows
if we'll ever figure that out.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.377
But they're creating
a lot of chaos.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.464
We have to do whatever it takes
to get back.

02:10.464 --> 02:14.009
And you will. But for now,
you should all rest.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.427
You're safe here.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.267
[gasps]

02:23.477 --> 02:25.020
Whoa! [gasps]

02:26.688 --> 02:28.607
[laughs]

02:28.607 --> 02:30.901
Hunter, look at
all this awesome human stuff.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.029
[shatters]

02:34.029 --> 02:34.946
Whoops.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.784
I think it's just "stuff" here.

02:38.784 --> 02:41.787
It's not much,
but I hope
you two will be comfortable.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.038
We will, Luz's mom.

02:43.038 --> 02:43.955
[clears throat]

02:45.332 --> 02:47.417
Thank you for providing us
with shelter, ma'am.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.044
Please never do that again.

02:49.044 --> 02:51.963
And you can call me Camila.
Buenas noches.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.927
[gasps] Aw.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.723
In the morning,
instead of screaming,
it'll do this.

03:01.723 --> 03:02.683
[beeping]

03:04.267 --> 03:06.395
Don't worry, Vee!
We'll keep you safe.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.106
Good work. It's dead.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.359
Uh... Thanks.

03:13.485 --> 03:14.986
I'll figure that out later.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.581
Mama, I--
I know I shouldn't have left.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.751
I never meant to lie,
but I had to stay,
and it wasn't because I--

03:29.751 --> 03:33.296
Hey, hey.
We'll have time to talk later.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.882
I'm just so happy you're home.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.385
Yeah. I'm home.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.179
But they're not.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.162
[trilling R's]

06:14.374 --> 06:17.669
[mumbling]
Am I doing this right?

06:17.669 --> 06:19.671
[speaking Spanish]

06:22.340 --> 06:25.886
[tablet] Perfecto!
You're our top student!

06:25.886 --> 06:28.847
Hmm. I was the top student once.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.933
He's still doing that, huh?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.810
He won't tell me
what he's looking for.

06:36.730 --> 06:41.401
Hi. Ooh! I like what you've done
with the place.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.571
No more exposed nails
or possum nests.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.197
But this still confuses me.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.661
Yeah. He still confuses us too.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.664
Hola, Camila. We're learning
Spanish from this scary owl app.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.833
Hoot, hoot! Practice every day,

06:56.833 --> 06:59.169
or I'll appear
in your nightmares.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.254
Oh, okay.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.090
Well, I'm going to pick up Luz
from school. Pop quiz.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.051
[in Spanish]

07:06.051 --> 07:08.011
Oh, oh! Uh... [inhales]

07:08.011 --> 07:10.013
[speaking Spanish]

07:13.350 --> 07:15.226
[in Spanish]

07:16.519 --> 07:19.564
Muy bueno! Keep it up.

07:19.564 --> 07:20.940
Ooh. [sighs]

07:20.940 --> 07:23.818
I never expected to be
a mother of six.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.571
-[tablet speaking Spanish]
-[ all speaking Spanish]

07:29.407 --> 07:31.743
[sighs]
Maybe we should take a break.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.286
A siesta.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.704
Siesta!

07:34.704 --> 07:36.289
We've been here for months,

07:36.289 --> 07:38.833
and we've made no progress
on the portal door.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.169
We can't expect Camila
to take care of us forever.

07:41.169 --> 07:44.589
In the meantime,
we could pull more weight
around the kitchen.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.759
My mustard ravioli did
bring tears to her eyes.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.011
Those weren't the kind of tears
you're thinking of.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.888
I can help fix damaged clothes.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.682
I can spruce up the garden.
[growls]

07:57.018 --> 07:58.144
[gasps]

07:58.144 --> 07:59.646
[wind howling]

08:01.856 --> 08:04.234
Maybe we need to look elsewhere.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.277
There's an entire Human Realm
to search.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.904
[shutter clicks]

08:07.904 --> 08:09.781
But Luz has school
most of the week.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.450
So? Let's explore
the town ourselves.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.786
After all, Luz went
into the Boiling Isles
on her own.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.706
If Eda came here before,
maybe there were others.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.708
Maybe they left behind
something we can use.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.501
Yes! That's the spirit!

08:21.501 --> 08:23.920
Together, there is no challenge
that can hold us back.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.506
[groans] Ow.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.842
It's a sign. We're doomed!

08:28.842 --> 08:31.344
Come on, Flapjack.
This isn't funny anymore.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.180
[gasps]

08:34.180 --> 08:35.598
There's something in here.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.351
[all gasp]

08:42.772 --> 08:45.191
Hmm. Looks like a map?

08:45.191 --> 08:46.860
Or a secret code?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.319
[Flapjack twitters]

08:48.319 --> 08:51.114
Flapjack, is this
what you've been looking for?

08:51.114 --> 08:52.490
What does it lead to?

08:52.490 --> 08:57.245
That eye, it kinda looks like
the old portal door.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.497
[both gasp] The portal door!

08:59.497 --> 09:02.876
Portal door! Portal door!
Portal door!

09:02.876 --> 09:04.294
Let's tell Luz.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.379
What if it's
just another dead end?

09:06.379 --> 09:09.466
She already feels responsible
for our failed attempts.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.010
Then let's not tell her
until we can figure it out.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.720
Using our buff brains!

09:13.720 --> 09:15.138
Buff brains!

09:15.138 --> 09:16.931
[laughs] Yeah!

09:16.931 --> 09:18.808
[school bell rings]

09:18.808 --> 09:21.770
[Mr. Sandoval] "Foes vanquished,
he trod the shores
of his fatherland,

09:21.770 --> 09:24.898
family by his side,
finally at peace."

09:24.898 --> 09:29.527
This epic ends
with the homecoming
of not just a man, but a hero.

09:29.527 --> 09:33.198
Hero? Everywhere he went,
people ended up suffering.

09:33.198 --> 09:37.077
It does get bleak,
but no one said
his mission would be easy.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.829
And when you take into account
the ripple effects
of his actions...

09:39.829 --> 09:43.333
Who cares
about the ripple effects?

09:43.333 --> 09:46.002
He was just a pawn
in someone else's game.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.922
And he was never smart enough
to realize it.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.133
If his friends and family
knew about his mission,

09:52.133 --> 09:55.970
they'd know that their lives
would never have been in danger
if it weren't for him.

09:55.970 --> 10:00.600
They should hate his guts,
and it would be better
if he literally never existed!

10:05.021 --> 10:06.231
[school bell rings]

10:16.825 --> 10:17.742
[sighs]

10:24.165 --> 10:25.667
[gasps]
Hey! You're Luz, right?

10:25.667 --> 10:28.211
Uh...
Nice to meet ya.
You were right in class.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.547
We read
about too many crusty old dudes.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.382
Give me books
about crusty old women!

10:33.174 --> 10:34.843
I used to know one.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.761
I've never seen you two around.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.514
We're new, but we've heard
all about you.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.517
Are you gonna make another crazy
costume for Halloween this year?

10:42.517 --> 10:46.271
'Cause if you are,
we're volunteering
at the Haunted Hayride.

10:46.271 --> 10:49.482
[student 2] Old Gravesfield is
the most haunted place
in the state.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.900
[student 1]
Yeah, you gotta come. [chuckles]

10:54.445 --> 10:56.614
[Camila] Do you think
this food is okay? Ah...

10:56.614 --> 10:59.325
I wish I knew how to make
demon food for your friends.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.787
Would they, um, prefer
to drink blood?
Mom.

11:02.787 --> 11:07.208
Ay, I'm sorry.
I'm just saying if we need
to find a way, we'll find a way.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.459
No, look out!
[both gasp]

11:11.504 --> 11:14.215
Oh, it was so scary.
It just came out of nowhere.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.718
That deer really spooked us.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.344
Will my insurance cover this?

11:18.344 --> 11:20.221
But, Mommy, it wasn't a deer.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.640
It was a monster!

11:28.521 --> 11:29.939
[Camila]
Thanks for helping, Gus.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.483
[Gus] Anytime. Good night!

11:32.483 --> 11:37.405
Whoo! We've got a big day
ahead of us,
so I'm gonna buenas this noche.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.990
[Hunter] Mm-hmm! Ow!

11:38.990 --> 11:41.159
[whimpers]

11:41.159 --> 11:44.329
You good? That sounded painful.

11:44.329 --> 11:48.291
[scoffs] I've been training
in the Emperor's Coven
for as long as I can remember.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.501
I think I can handle a little...
[groans]

11:50.501 --> 11:51.711
...pain.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.339
Oh. That went clean through.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.969
Camila taught me how to use
this sewing contraption.

11:59.969 --> 12:03.014
Even Darius's stitches
have never been this neat.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.433
Oh, and look at what I made!

12:05.433 --> 12:09.854
These are mystical beasts
called wolves,
and I love them.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.315
That looks great.

12:12.315 --> 12:15.235
You know, you've been smiling
a lot more
since we've been here.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.278
It's not like
I don't want to return.

12:17.278 --> 12:21.282
I just need a way
to pass the time. That's all.

12:21.282 --> 12:24.244
No. It's good to see you happy.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.912
One of us might as well be.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.543
What was it like to be
in the Emperor's Coven
for so long?

12:33.836 --> 12:35.546
I trained a lot.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.091
I studied a lot.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.302
I wasn't really allowed
to be around the other scouts.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.887
But weekends were nice.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.139
I got to leave the castle
for missions.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.474
Do you miss it?

12:46.474 --> 12:50.353
I miss knowing
who I'm supposed to be.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.234
I miss my dad.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.822
We'll find a way back.
We have to.

13:00.822 --> 13:03.908
Oh, my Titan.
That's a line
from this book I found.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.286
Cosmic Frontier!

13:06.286 --> 13:10.039
It's a story that takes place
in the stars.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.542
Why would anyone wanna go
up there?

13:12.542 --> 13:15.211
I don't know. Humans like
spreading their junk everywhere.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.588
But it's a story of people
trying to get back home,
like us.

13:17.588 --> 13:18.881
Uh-huh.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.426
We got Captain Avery,
Security Officer Quando,

13:21.426 --> 13:25.680
and a Chief Engineer O'Bailey
who's hiding as a clone
from the enemy planet.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.849
[gasps]

13:27.849 --> 13:30.977
What, uh, happens to him?

13:30.977 --> 13:32.687
I guess you'll have to find out.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.461
They don't hate garlic
like vampires,

13:56.461 --> 14:00.590
but they weren't entirely
against eyeballs when we were
watching that zombie movie.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.760
Gus said I could get apple blood
from the apple butcher,

14:03.760 --> 14:07.013
but... [yawns] ...until I find
one of those,

14:08.014 --> 14:09.849
I'll have to use food coloring.

14:13.644 --> 14:14.562
[gasps]

14:15.855 --> 14:17.940
Look what I found!

14:17.940 --> 14:19.734
Gross, don't touch
that dead thing.
Ew. Gross.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.402
It's not dead.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.863
This is the skin
of a garter snake.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.074
They shed
their pajamas as they grow.

14:26.074 --> 14:30.912
It means there's
a snake near us,
and it just got a lot bigger!

14:30.912 --> 14:33.247
Ew!
[all scream]

14:33.247 --> 14:34.707
[laughs]

14:34.707 --> 14:36.501
She called them pajamas.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.503
Ugh. So unhygienic.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.546
That girl must've been
raised by wolves.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.257
Hey! Wolves are
actually great parents, and--

14:43.257 --> 14:46.260
O happy dagger! Give me death!
Huh?

14:46.260 --> 14:47.678
[groans]
[screaming]

14:47.678 --> 14:50.014
[laughs]

14:50.014 --> 14:51.724
Her dad taught her that one.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.018
[retches] Gross!
Now everything smells
like lunch meat.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.062
Yeah, she's such a try-hard.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.980
Oye! What did you just say?

14:57.980 --> 15:00.066
[screams, grunts]

15:00.399 --> 15:03.653
I said, grief can manifest
in different ways.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.988
Like how Luz
has been acting out
for attention.

15:05.988 --> 15:09.033
Losing Manny was difficult
for both of us,

15:09.033 --> 15:11.911
but Luz has always
done things differently.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.664
Didn't you say you were bullied
in high school, Mrs. Noceda?

15:17.125 --> 15:18.960
Uh, yes, but--

15:18.960 --> 15:22.255
Luz hasn't made any friends,
her grades are inconsistent,

15:22.255 --> 15:25.299
and I heard she brought
a live snake to school?

15:25.299 --> 15:28.553
Take this. It could help her.

15:28.553 --> 15:31.764
"Reality Check Camp"?

15:31.764 --> 15:34.809
You don't want Luz to struggle
like you did, right?

15:35.643 --> 15:37.103
-[Luz] Mom?
-[gasps]

15:37.103 --> 15:39.021
[pants]

15:39.021 --> 15:41.023
Luz? What time is it?

15:43.276 --> 15:44.735
Mom?

15:44.735 --> 15:46.571
Why aren't you mad at me?

15:46.571 --> 15:50.158
[sighs] Oh, baby. Come here.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.785
I've been terrified, sure.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.662
But believe it or not,

15:54.662 --> 15:57.415
I do understand what it's like
to want to run away.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.709
I'm so sorry.

15:59.709 --> 16:04.255
But the point is, you came home,
and everything is okay now.

16:04.255 --> 16:07.466
But it's not.
It's my fault
everyone's trapped here.

16:07.466 --> 16:11.220
And I don't even know
if King and Eda are okay.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.974
I wanted you to meet them
so bad. But I keep messing up.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.978
Hey, everyone makes mistakes.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.147
What matters is
that you learn from them.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.692
Can I sleep here tonight?

16:28.112 --> 16:30.072
Give the palisman a kiss too.
[kisses]

16:45.087 --> 16:47.465
All right. Luz is
at her mom's vet clinic,

16:47.465 --> 16:51.510
putting tiny little bandages
on "hedgehogs."

16:51.510 --> 16:54.388
So today, we're going into town
to solve this code.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.806
Ears.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.517
Routes.
Snacks, check.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.478
[Hunter] Human disguise, check.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.397
Eh?

17:04.315 --> 17:07.443
Oh, that is a look.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.863
According to Cosmic Frontier,
this is what the modern,
human male wears.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.451
This was written in the '90s
about the year 2008.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.787
Yeah. Can't wait
for that New Year's party.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.622
And did you get
to the last chapter?

17:19.622 --> 17:23.084
O'Bailey is still hiding
the fact that he's a Duplicant
in hyperdisguise.

17:23.084 --> 17:26.045
But Captain Avery is
figuring it out.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.880
I think he already knows but--

17:27.880 --> 17:30.174
Ah, bup-bup-bup!
No, no, no, no, no spoilers!

17:30.174 --> 17:32.218
Hunter, I don't think
the world is ready

17:32.218 --> 17:36.055
for the brave fashion choices
of the year 2008. Please change.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.932
Don't listen to her.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.643
Aw, geez, we're gonna
miss the bus.

17:40.643 --> 17:44.063
Oh, it's okay! I'll catch up.
There's a transport worm
every half hour.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.190
[cat meows]

17:48.693 --> 17:50.695
I'm gonna borrow that book
when you're done with it.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.532
[Flapjack twitters]

17:58.327 --> 18:00.538
You know,
maybe you're right, Flap.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.498
Even if I'm not
who I'm supposed to be...

18:03.666 --> 18:05.084
I like who I am right now.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.470
[gasps]

18:20.182 --> 18:22.018
[Amity] First stop,
The Magic Circle.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.276
Hey!

19:22.787 --> 19:24.121
[shrieks]

19:24.121 --> 19:25.956
[all scream]

19:28.209 --> 19:31.671
I don't blame our ancestors
for banishing those guys. Yeesh.

19:31.671 --> 19:35.091
Dad, can we go to the bird hall?

19:35.091 --> 19:37.301
In a minute.
How about we eat first?

19:37.301 --> 19:38.219
[both] Yeah!

19:42.306 --> 19:45.810
[sighs] I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this, but...

19:47.019 --> 19:49.438
I think I know where to go next.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.488
You can wait here
if it's too scary.

19:57.488 --> 20:00.491
Luz told me about that
creepy witch-hunter wannabe.

20:00.491 --> 20:05.079
It's okay. We just faced down
a giraffe. I can do this!

20:06.330 --> 20:08.541
[screams] Huh?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.752
You're not Jacob.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.504
We can all
thank Goddess for that.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.841
He got fired after he started
making edits to the exhibits.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.512
I work part-time now.

20:21.512 --> 20:25.224
Say, have we met?
Something about you
seems familiar.

20:25.224 --> 20:30.312
Uh, no. I'm new in town.
I just have one of those faces.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.566
J-- But just the one.
The normal amount of face.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.153
[laughs]
What a coincidence, me too.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.155
If you ever need a tour guide,
hit me up.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.743
We're actually here
to ask about this old puzzle.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.077
Do you know how to decode it?

20:45.077 --> 20:47.079
Ooh, a rebus.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.290
They dug up a bunch of these
in Old Gravesfield.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.041
This is a rebus?

20:51.041 --> 20:55.045
Yeah. It's like a riddle
where pictures and symbols
make up a word.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.338
Like-- Come here.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.882
What do you think
they were trying to say?

20:57.882 --> 20:59.175
Chop off an ear!

20:59.175 --> 21:02.011
No. See the H that comes first?

21:02.011 --> 21:06.974
Then combine that with the ear
and maybe it means "hear" like,
to listen.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.727
Or, "here" as in a place.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.604
Maybe something is
waiting somewhere.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.856
[phone rings]

21:13.856 --> 21:15.316
I'll be right back.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.569
If this is a portal door
then what about these?

21:18.569 --> 21:22.406
A ribbon, and tanning a hide?

21:23.407 --> 21:25.618
That ribbon is tied together.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.703
[Gus] Next to that hand
with a cut.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.996
You don't think...

21:28.996 --> 21:30.331
This is leading us to...

21:30.331 --> 21:31.582
[Amity] Tie tan's...

21:32.208 --> 21:33.542
blood?

21:33.542 --> 21:35.795
[all gasp] Titan's Blood!

21:35.795 --> 21:38.214
It's like you're
reading each others' minds.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.840
You must have been friends
forever!

21:41.217 --> 21:43.719
It wasn't always like this.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.430
These past few months
have been weird

21:46.430 --> 21:48.641
but look at
all the new memories
we have now.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.687
It's been nice to finally
spend some time together.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.109
Yeah.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.612
I can't wait
to show everyone at home.

22:01.612 --> 22:04.114
Maybe the scrapbook
could use one more?

22:05.491 --> 22:07.117
Aw, come here, Vee.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.620
Everyone say,
"Giraffes are still terrifying!"

22:10.204 --> 22:11.455
[laughter]

22:14.834 --> 22:16.001
Hmm.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.296
Hey.

22:19.296 --> 22:23.509
That map of Old Gravesfield
looks exactly like this.

22:23.509 --> 22:26.887
Do you think it's a map
to a stash of Titan's Blood?

22:26.887 --> 22:29.765
With that,
we could actually
create a portal.

22:29.765 --> 22:33.352
I can't wait to tell Luz!
And I know just
how to surprise her.

22:40.860 --> 22:44.196
[sighs] What will you be,
little palisman?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.031
A bird like Owlbert?

22:46.031 --> 22:47.533
A cool bug?

22:47.533 --> 22:49.410
Maybe an octopus,
so we can hold hands?

22:50.536 --> 22:51.453
Maybe...

22:52.413 --> 22:54.623
Maybe you'll never hatch.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.834
And I messed up your life too.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.294
[Camila] How's the lamp working?

22:58.294 --> 22:59.420
Just fine.

22:59.420 --> 23:00.880
Good. I'm ready to lock up.

23:03.924 --> 23:04.842
Huh?

23:11.473 --> 23:12.933
[Flapjack twitters]

23:12.933 --> 23:15.728
Did you know about this?
That he was here?

23:15.728 --> 23:17.521
I can tell
you're hiding something.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.148
[chirps]
[sighs]

23:19.148 --> 23:21.817
Sorry. I shouldn't take this
out on you.

23:21.817 --> 23:22.902
I'm just scared.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.361
[vehicle approaches]

23:28.657 --> 23:30.451
-[chirps]
-Don't worry, Flap.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.870
If Belos is really here,
I'll keep you safe.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.246
[twittering]

23:41.045 --> 23:42.546
Hunter, what's wrong?

23:42.546 --> 23:43.547
Belos.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.257
[gasps]

23:49.762 --> 23:51.680
Are you sure you saw him?

23:51.680 --> 23:53.599
I thought The Collector
destroyed Belos.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.851
Yeah. I'm-- I'm sure.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.898
Hey. We can wait
for the others if you--

24:00.898 --> 24:04.068
No! We have to take care
of this ourselves.

24:04.068 --> 24:08.364
[sighs] Titan, I hate this!
I was never scared
as the Golden Guard.

24:08.364 --> 24:11.659
Then how about
we bring back some of that
masked confidence, huh?

24:11.659 --> 24:12.743
[growls]

24:15.955 --> 24:17.456
[Hunter] All right, Belos!

24:17.456 --> 24:19.708
What's about to happen
should be relatively painless,

24:19.708 --> 24:21.502
if you just do what we say.

24:21.502 --> 24:25.381
That's right! So come out
with your hands
behind your creepy, dumb head!

24:28.133 --> 24:29.385
[whooshes]

24:40.396 --> 24:41.814

[rat screeches]

25:30.154 --> 25:32.990
Oh, thank goodness.
It's just a little angel.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.575
No one's here.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.535
I guess it was just in my head.

25:36.535 --> 25:40.330
Well, can't blame you
for being paranoid after
everything we've been through.

25:40.330 --> 25:43.917
Yeah. You know,
I just wanna
make sure everyone's safe.

25:43.917 --> 25:46.378
Same. And that includes you too.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.629
What?
Yeah.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.423
Gonna make sure
you're safe too, Hunter.

25:49.423 --> 25:50.466
You're family now.

25:50.466 --> 25:51.550
Oh.

[chuckles]

25:52.760 --> 25:56.346
[crying]

26:03.896 --> 26:06.023
Ah, this mask is
pretty gross now.

26:07.024 --> 26:09.068
[both laugh]

26:09.068 --> 26:10.778
Let's get back
before anyone worries.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.571
Yeah. Everything's okay.

26:13.530 --> 26:14.406
Belos is gone.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.582
Hey, we're back! [chuckles]

26:23.582 --> 26:26.376
And we bought some, uh, cars.

26:28.629 --> 26:31.340
Luz! We're designing
our costumes
for the Haunted Hayride.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.634
Guess what I've got planned?

26:33.634 --> 26:35.844
I'm gonna be Captain Avery
and you're...

26:35.844 --> 26:38.097
[gasps] Chief Engineer O'Bailey?

26:38.097 --> 26:39.681
[moans]

26:41.016 --> 26:43.018
How do you know
about Cosmic Frontier?

26:43.018 --> 26:44.436
All the books in your basement.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.647
Oh! [laughs]

26:46.647 --> 26:49.942
Funny how things just
show up in basements, right?

26:49.942 --> 26:52.528
Without you hiding
or putting them there.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.071
[laughs]

26:54.071 --> 26:56.782
Life sure is full of surprises.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.868
Cool! Humans freak out
just like us.

26:59.868 --> 27:03.747
It'll be fun.
We want to experience
your weird human traditions.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.500
[laughing]

27:06.500 --> 27:09.294
And I thought you and I
could take inspiration from...

27:10.796 --> 27:13.674
Good Witch Azura The Movie 2:
The Betrayanning!

27:13.674 --> 27:14.591
[beeps]

27:16.802 --> 27:19.054
Hecate! I'll protect you!

27:19.054 --> 27:22.224
Give her over, Azura.
It's for your own good.

27:22.224 --> 27:23.433
Never!

27:23.433 --> 27:25.727
I could be the Hecate
to your Azura.

27:27.145 --> 27:31.733
What do you think?
Oh, wow. Yeah, let's do it!

27:31.733 --> 27:34.194
How could you do it,
Villainous Lucy?

27:34.194 --> 27:37.823
How could you betray
your friends?
Now everyone is gone!

27:37.823 --> 27:39.992
It was for the greater good.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.827
We'll never forgive you.

27:42.703 --> 27:43.620
Never!

28:00.262 --> 28:01.346
[laptop chimes]

28:07.102 --> 28:08.437
Dear Diary,

28:08.437 --> 28:10.981
all I ever wanted
was to be good at something,

28:10.981 --> 28:14.818
to be around people
who also liked that something.

28:14.818 --> 28:17.237
And when I found
the Demon Realm, I thought,

28:17.237 --> 28:22.367
"Wow, I found it.
I can learn magic.
I can be a witch!

28:22.367 --> 28:25.412
I won't be the dummy in
the principal's office anymore!"

28:27.539 --> 28:31.376
But I messed up too much,
and put everyone in danger.

28:33.587 --> 28:37.049
Mama says I have to
learn from my mistakes.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.551
So, I know
what I have to do now...

28:59.696 --> 29:01.949
Make sure to help Vee
with the trick-or-treaters.

29:01.949 --> 29:04.868
You know, they can be...
demanding.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.371
Luz, are you okay?
You don't look so well.

29:07.371 --> 29:10.832
I was just so excited for this,
I couldn't sleep.

29:10.832 --> 29:14.378
All right.
We'll keep the puzzle a secret
till the time is right.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.421
And then we'll tell her
about the Titan Blood!

29:17.172 --> 29:18.507
[Belos laughing]

29:23.136 --> 29:24.179
Did you hear that?

29:24.179 --> 29:25.722
[chirps]

29:25.722 --> 29:29.142
Hey, it's okay.
It's probably just
in my head again.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.769
Nestle down, Flapjack.
[chirps]

29:34.690 --> 29:38.986
We're gonna have the best night,
and we might even have
a surprise for you.

29:38.986 --> 29:39.987
Yeah, me too.

29:47.703 --> 29:52.249
I hath seen the Mrs. Smith
consorting with spirits unpure.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.668
Is this true, Mrs. Smith?

29:54.668 --> 29:56.962
Nay, 'tis a fool lie!

29:56.962 --> 29:59.673
Inquisitor Jones is tarring me
a demon's varlet

29:59.673 --> 30:01.383
so as to take mine fields!

30:01.383 --> 30:02.843
Demon lies!

30:02.843 --> 30:05.012
Your honor, I do object!

30:05.012 --> 30:08.056
It is Inquisitor Jones
who's in league
with the dark forces!

30:08.056 --> 30:09.641
Kid, come on,
this is my spotlight.

30:09.641 --> 30:10.559
Behold.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.396
[gasps, screams]

30:16.606 --> 30:18.483
[crowd cheering]

30:18.483 --> 30:21.153
Why are you clapping?

30:21.153 --> 30:22.654
[gasps, grunts]

30:22.654 --> 30:26.116
These children are demon spawn.
And they want your teeth!

30:27.409 --> 30:29.870
Look! Look at his ears!
He's from Mars!

30:29.870 --> 30:31.955
Hey, lay off the costume, man.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.708
[screams] Let go! [groans]

30:35.375 --> 30:36.918
[sighs]

30:45.260 --> 30:48.722
I hope you're all prepared
for a truly scary ride.

30:48.722 --> 30:51.433
Make us cry! Make us cry!

30:51.433 --> 30:56.146
Because there's nothing scarier
than knowledge.

30:56.146 --> 30:58.690
Boo, just lie to me!

30:58.690 --> 31:02.986
Let me tell you the eeriest
unsolved mystery of Gravesfield.

31:02.986 --> 31:06.114
The Tale
of the Brothers Wittebane.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.950
Wittebane? Isn't that Belos?

31:11.453 --> 31:13.205
[Masha] The year is 1613.

31:14.581 --> 31:17.542
Two orphaned brothers
arrive in Gravesfield.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.377
Their names? Philip...

31:22.547 --> 31:23.799
...and Caleb.

31:25.926 --> 31:26.843
Oh, no.

31:29.096 --> 31:31.932
[Masha] Caleb did his best
to take care
of his younger brother.

31:31.932 --> 31:36.853
They tried to fit in
with this town,
and its unsavory practices.

31:36.853 --> 31:39.022
They became witch-hunters.

31:40.107 --> 31:42.150
Local lore suggests

31:42.150 --> 31:46.738
that the Brothers Wittebane met
a real witch from another world!

31:46.738 --> 31:49.407
Her name was Evelyn.

31:49.407 --> 31:52.202
And the older brother was
spirited away.

31:52.202 --> 31:57.082
She dazzled him with magic
and visions of a strange
yet beautiful place.

31:57.082 --> 32:00.377
They used a secret code
to travel between worlds.

32:00.377 --> 32:04.297
Philip set off
to save his brother
and bring the witch to justice.

32:04.297 --> 32:08.760
But neither were
ever seen again!

32:08.760 --> 32:12.639
Maybe Philip saved Caleb,
and they went on
to lead peaceful lives.

32:12.639 --> 32:16.059
Or maybe he's still
chasing his brother,

32:16.059 --> 32:19.437
caught in a cycle
of horror and strife!

32:19.437 --> 32:20.856
[all gasp]

32:23.859 --> 32:26.945
Sounds like big bro
got a hot witch girlfriend
and little bro got upset.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.238
But that's just me.

32:34.578 --> 32:36.913
[Belos laughing]

32:36.913 --> 32:38.206
[gasps]

32:38.206 --> 32:39.583
Luz.
[yelps]

32:41.293 --> 32:42.752
What's going on?

32:42.752 --> 32:46.298
It's him. He's here!
I saw him this time.

32:46.298 --> 32:49.134
And it wasn't
in my head after all.
You believe me, right?

32:49.134 --> 32:51.928
Well, how can you be sure?
What would he be doing here?

32:53.805 --> 32:54.848
Titan Blood.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.143
I'm not supposed to tell.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.437
But the secret code
that guide mentioned?

33:00.437 --> 33:03.648
It's a puzzle,
a rebus we found in the shack.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.692
Amity thinks it leads
to Titan Blood!

33:05.692 --> 33:08.528
Titan Blood? Puzzles? Amity?

33:08.528 --> 33:10.280
Why didn't anyone say anything?

33:10.280 --> 33:12.449
You and your mom do
so much for us.

33:12.449 --> 33:14.451
We wanted
to do something for you,

33:14.451 --> 33:17.120
and she's gonna surprise you
with it tonight.

33:17.120 --> 33:20.415
That is so sweet.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.378
Hey, where's Luz and Hunter?

33:25.378 --> 33:28.423
We need to find
the Titan Blood first.
Just to make sure.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.175
I don't wanna
freak anyone out yet.

33:30.175 --> 33:33.386
You don't believe me yet,
do you? Fine.
I'll prove he's here.

33:33.386 --> 33:34.804
-Flapjack!
-[chirps]

33:35.639 --> 33:36.640
Can you get the rebus?

33:38.475 --> 33:40.393
I'll say that again.

33:40.393 --> 33:41.645
[distorted] Get the rebus.

33:42.312 --> 33:43.563
[chirping]

33:43.563 --> 33:45.273
Hey! What the heck?

33:45.273 --> 33:48.818
Sorry. I don't know
what came over me.

33:48.818 --> 33:49.861
[chirping]

33:53.782 --> 33:54.699
Good work.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.328
[grunts, pants]

34:06.419 --> 34:08.546
Oh! [gasps, sighs]

34:08.546 --> 34:10.674
So we moved.

34:10.674 --> 34:13.134
Mom says it's because
the house isn't "pretty enough",

34:13.134 --> 34:15.929
but I think it's because
there's a better hospital
for dad nearby.

34:17.973 --> 34:21.685
'Cause, let's be honest,
this house ain't
that much prettier.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.313
I think this might be
the worst week ever.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.401
But Dad left me this book.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.653
I can't wait to read it.

34:31.653 --> 34:35.699
I loved it! I loved it so much!
[giggles]

34:35.699 --> 34:38.285
Look what I got
at the convention. [laughs]

34:38.285 --> 34:39.953
I'm gonna cut my hair with it.

34:39.953 --> 34:41.579
That was a bad idea.

34:42.872 --> 34:45.292
Mom saw my report card.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.544
Mija,
if you just applied yourself.

34:47.544 --> 34:50.588
But I am applying myself.

34:50.588 --> 34:55.051
My baseball stitches are
so small,
they're practically invisible.

34:55.051 --> 34:58.805
And I can read
and write Witchtongue
in five different dialects.

34:58.805 --> 35:02.892
Also, I can sit so perfectly
still that woodland creatures
come and sit on me.

35:08.023 --> 35:11.234
But I guess none of this
is gonna matter on the SATs.

35:11.234 --> 35:14.321
It's been really rough for Mom
since the funeral.

35:14.321 --> 35:17.824
So, I'm gonna wow
my teacher's face off
with this book report!

35:17.824 --> 35:22.621
Mom, you won't have
to worry about me ever again.

35:22.621 --> 35:26.124
Mama says I have to learn
from my mistakes.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.460
So, I know
what I have to do now.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.212
On Halloween, after the Hayride,

35:31.212 --> 35:34.299
I'm telling everyone I'm staying
in the Human Realm. Permanently.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.887
[Hunter panting]

35:46.269 --> 35:47.187
What the...

35:52.317 --> 35:53.943
There! [panting]

35:53.943 --> 35:55.153
Hunter!

35:56.655 --> 35:58.740
[Luz panting]

36:00.408 --> 36:01.326
Hunter!

36:02.369 --> 36:03.953
Think. Think.

36:03.953 --> 36:06.289
Hunter is following the rebus
to the Titan's Blood.

36:06.289 --> 36:08.124
But how can I find
the blood without him?

36:08.124 --> 36:09.626
Come on. You can do this.

36:09.626 --> 36:10.543
[gasps]

36:14.506 --> 36:15.882
[gasps]

36:23.014 --> 36:25.642
Glyphs are powered
by the magic of the isles,

36:25.642 --> 36:29.062
by the Titan itself!

36:29.062 --> 36:32.023
Closer I am to the Titan Blood,
the stronger the glyphs become.

36:39.072 --> 36:42.158
Luz? Hunter? Did you find them?

36:42.158 --> 36:45.412
Calm down. They probably just
went to buy some more cars.

36:45.412 --> 36:48.540
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.
I just--
I wanted to show Luz the rebus.

36:49.791 --> 36:51.209
Wait. Where did it go?

36:51.209 --> 36:52.711
[all gasp]

36:52.711 --> 36:54.421
Kids! Have you seen Luz?

36:54.421 --> 36:57.006
And has she, um,
said anything weird?

36:57.006 --> 36:59.384
Boom! Find a phone.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.010
[beeping]

37:14.899 --> 37:18.236
Hunter, are you okay?
Did you see Belos?

37:20.655 --> 37:22.282
Oh, no.

37:22.282 --> 37:24.826
Just my imagination
playing tricks again.

37:24.826 --> 37:28.747
Why don't you find
the Titan Blood
while I find my palisman?

37:28.747 --> 37:30.874
Little guy got spooked off.

37:30.874 --> 37:32.125
Good idea.

37:32.125 --> 37:34.252
All this Belos talk has me
on edge.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.838
But I hate to ruin
Amity's surprise.

37:36.838 --> 37:39.507
I really appreciate
that everyone wanted to do this.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.925
[sighs]
You guys are great friends.

37:42.552 --> 37:44.095
Have you found the blood yet?

37:44.095 --> 37:45.972
I'm on it. I just have to--

37:45.972 --> 37:47.390
[Flapjack chirping]

37:47.390 --> 37:51.060
Flapjack?
Why do you look so scared?

37:51.060 --> 37:51.936
[Hunter] Luz.

37:53.521 --> 37:56.232
[distorted] Didn't you use
an ice glyph to get here?

37:57.650 --> 37:59.652
Your magic is working.

38:01.362 --> 38:03.281
[Amity] Luz?
I think she's this way.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.491
-[Camila] Mija?
-[Willow] Hunter?

38:04.491 --> 38:06.159
-[Gus] Guys, where are you?
-[Amity] Luz?

38:06.159 --> 38:09.370
I saw you. Glyphs do work here.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.915
You. You survived.

38:11.915 --> 38:15.084
I did. Thanks again
for all the help, Luz.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.295
But I don't need you anymore.

38:19.881 --> 38:21.090
Flapjack!

38:22.091 --> 38:24.511
Ah. There you are.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.940
You're not
even trying right now.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.150
What? Afraid you'll hurt him?

38:39.150 --> 38:40.944
Is that Hunter?
Something's wrong.

38:42.946 --> 38:46.241
See, this is
why you're so useful, Luz.

38:46.241 --> 38:50.119
You're so desperate
to help people, you even
helped me meet The Collector.

38:51.871 --> 38:53.832
-What?
-I didn't mean to.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.875
I thought
I was doing something good.

38:55.875 --> 38:59.295
You did do something good.

38:59.295 --> 39:02.590
I thought this one
was another lost cause.

39:02.590 --> 39:07.136
Because of you, we can finish
our work as witch-hunters,
starting with them!

39:07.971 --> 39:09.055
[grunts]

39:12.934 --> 39:14.185
[laughs]

39:14.185 --> 39:15.687
Hey, Belos. Remember me?

39:18.690 --> 39:20.233
Hang tight, Hunter.

39:24.821 --> 39:25.738
Vee, watch out!

39:28.575 --> 39:29.909
[Gus grunts]
[all scream]

39:33.162 --> 39:34.372
[grunts]

39:35.665 --> 39:37.709
I know you can hear me, Hunter.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.252
Fight him off.

39:39.252 --> 39:40.545
-[both grunt]
-[Luz screams]

39:45.967 --> 39:47.343
[chirping]

39:49.721 --> 39:51.014
[Hunter] That's right.

39:51.014 --> 39:52.765
You wouldn't want me harming

39:52.765 --> 39:54.726
your precious palisman,
would you?

39:54.726 --> 39:57.478
Oh, but then again,
I don't care what you want.

39:57.478 --> 39:59.355
Goodbye, Evelyn.

40:00.356 --> 40:01.566
[gasps]

40:03.109 --> 40:05.194
[groans]

40:05.194 --> 40:06.404
Flapjack!

40:07.363 --> 40:09.407
Flapjack, you'll be okay.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.535
[groaning]

40:19.042 --> 40:20.460
You know what I'd like, Belos?

40:21.169 --> 40:23.796
[groaning]

40:23.796 --> 40:26.215
I'd like to leave
the Emperor's Coven

40:26.215 --> 40:28.927
and never step foot
in that throne room again.

40:28.927 --> 40:32.847
I'd like to study wild magic
and learn how to carve palismen.

40:32.847 --> 40:36.017
I'd like to attend Hexside
as a regular student

40:36.017 --> 40:39.145
and play flyer derby
with my friends.

40:39.145 --> 40:45.151
But most of all,
I'd like to make sure
you never hurt anyone again!

40:45.151 --> 40:46.069
[grunts]

40:46.778 --> 40:48.446
No!

40:53.159 --> 40:55.036
Oh, no! No!
Move.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.753
[gasps]

41:05.964 --> 41:07.256
[Willow] Be careful with him.

41:11.427 --> 41:13.096
[screaming]

41:18.267 --> 41:20.061
[roars]

41:20.061 --> 41:23.982
Caleb,
you would stab me in the back?

41:23.982 --> 41:26.484
You did it to him first.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.069
[growls]

41:43.793 --> 41:46.504
This is for the good
of your souls.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.172
You'll thank me later.

41:55.054 --> 41:57.640
That's the Belos
you've been fighting
this whole time?

41:57.640 --> 41:59.642
Guys, Hunter isn't moving.

41:59.642 --> 42:02.270
Vee, call an ambulance.

42:02.270 --> 42:04.647
Uh, do human doctors know
about possession?

42:04.647 --> 42:05.857
Or Grimwalkers?

42:05.857 --> 42:07.817
Possession?
Grimwalkers?

42:07.817 --> 42:09.402
[Camila] We should still
call a doctor.

42:09.402 --> 42:11.237
-[Vee] I'm not getting
cell reception.
-[Amity] What do we do?

42:14.490 --> 42:15.742
[chirps]

42:33.426 --> 42:34.469
[groans]

42:36.220 --> 42:39.098
Hey, guys.
Is everyone else okay?

42:40.016 --> 42:41.726
Actually, Flapjack...

42:41.726 --> 42:43.061
Don't. Don't.

42:45.480 --> 42:46.647
I already know.

42:49.734 --> 42:53.029
Sit up slowly, baby.
Are you in pain anywhere?

42:53.029 --> 42:55.073
I'm okay.

42:55.073 --> 43:00.578
Um, Luz. What did Belos mean
when he said you helped him
meet The Collector?

43:00.578 --> 43:03.206
I mean, that was a lie, right?

43:03.206 --> 43:04.415
No, it was true.

43:06.250 --> 43:09.796
If it weren't for me,
the Day of Unity
would have never happened.

43:09.796 --> 43:12.465
There was this time pool,
and I met him.

43:12.465 --> 43:16.385
I met him when he was still
just Philip, and I taught him
the light spell.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.012
I introduced him
to The Collector.

43:18.012 --> 43:20.473
I set everything into motion.

43:20.473 --> 43:22.558
I'm sorry, everyone.

43:22.558 --> 43:24.852
Why did you keep
all that a secret?

43:26.354 --> 43:29.440
I was scared. I thought
you'd all hate me for it.

43:29.440 --> 43:32.652
Which is
why I've made a decision.

43:32.652 --> 43:36.781
I think it'd be
in everyone's best interest
if I--

43:36.781 --> 43:39.117
Took your mama
to the Demon Realm!

43:39.117 --> 43:40.576
What?

43:40.576 --> 43:42.745
I couldn't hate you, Luz.

43:42.745 --> 43:46.082
The fact that you still stand up
for us means enough to me.

43:46.082 --> 43:48.626
Mija, now that I've seen
what you're up against,

43:48.626 --> 43:51.379
there is no way
I'm letting you go back alone.

43:51.379 --> 43:55.383
It is our duty
to help your friends
get back to their families.

43:55.383 --> 43:57.135
But...
You were tricked.

43:57.135 --> 43:59.387
That's what Belos does.
He tricks people.

43:59.387 --> 44:01.681
But if it weren't you,
it would have been someone else,

44:01.681 --> 44:04.058
and then there'd be no one left
to fight back.

44:04.058 --> 44:06.519
So let's do that.
Let's fight back.

44:07.311 --> 44:09.438
Please? For Flapjack?

44:10.982 --> 44:12.191
For Flapjack.

44:12.191 --> 44:13.860
[portal pulsing]

44:16.404 --> 44:18.156
The portal's closing.

44:18.156 --> 44:19.282
Then we better head in.

44:22.660 --> 44:23.786
[groans]

44:25.246 --> 44:26.455
Time to go home, Flap.

44:28.082 --> 44:29.917
Goodbye, Human Realm.

44:29.917 --> 44:32.378
Thank you for showing me
your secrets.
I hope to see you again.

44:33.462 --> 44:34.881
Thanks for the memories.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.716
We'll be back
after we get some revenge.

44:39.677 --> 44:44.932
Luz, I know things are scary,
and I don't know
what the future holds.

44:44.932 --> 44:48.352
But it would be so cool
if you were a part of that.

44:49.353 --> 44:51.230
But no more hiding, okay?

44:52.190 --> 44:53.649
I understand.

44:53.649 --> 44:55.735
See you on the other side.
Promise.

45:05.953 --> 45:08.664
Here, you'll probably need this.

45:08.664 --> 45:10.208
Are you coming, Vee?

45:10.208 --> 45:11.792
I don't think I'm ready.

45:11.792 --> 45:14.962
Besides, someone has
to keep up appearances.

45:14.962 --> 45:17.340
Tell the staff I've gone home
to see my abuela, okay?

45:17.340 --> 45:19.842
Carmen's in charge,
Dianne has my schedule.

45:19.842 --> 45:22.136
And, thank you, Vee.

45:27.016 --> 45:28.226
[Camila] Are you ready?

45:28.226 --> 45:29.518
[Luz] Are you?

45:29.518 --> 45:31.520
I'm not sure what we'll see
on the other side.

45:33.105 --> 45:35.316
Then we don't wanna
leave unprepared.

45:39.987 --> 45:42.907
A good witch
always has to have her hat.

45:57.797 --> 46:01.509
[Vee] Shoot!
Camila still has the car keys.
