WEBVTT

00:06.150 --> 00:10.450
Sometimes you wake up in the morning
and you think "this could be it"

00:10.770 --> 00:14.700
"this could be enough. the rest of my life."

00:14.980 --> 00:17.300
- Morning
- hi

00:17.620 --> 00:20.070
- you ok?
- yeah. you?

00:21.370 --> 00:24.930
I was wondering if you wanted to
meet up for something to eat later?

00:24.930 --> 00:28.050
Yeah. I mean, if you...want to.

00:28.050 --> 00:29.930
That's why I asked.

00:32.210 --> 00:34.850
You expecting someone?
No. Excuse me.

00:45.490 --> 00:48.450
What?
You don't call, you never write.

00:48.450 --> 00:51.850
What do you want, Stephanie?
I'm here to make your day.

00:51.850 --> 00:53.890
Little proposition for you.

00:53.890 --> 00:55.850
One last job?

01:32.930 --> 01:35.210
As I said, I'm here to do business.

01:35.210 --> 01:38.770
And, strange though it may seem,
I'm not keen to discuss it here.

01:38.770 --> 01:41.930
You're not coming up.
Ashamed of something?
Not done the washing up?

01:41.930 --> 01:43.690
Or is there a doctor in the house?

01:43.690 --> 01:45.690
You can't just turn up here.

01:45.690 --> 01:49.130
If you answered your phone...
I don't own a work phone any more.

01:49.130 --> 01:52.370
I've told you, I'm retired.
Well, that's what I told the client.

01:52.370 --> 01:54.650
He immediately upped his offer
to Â£1,000.

01:54.650 --> 01:57.690
What client? What does it matter?
You're retired. Stephanie!

01:57.690 --> 02:00.450
A gentlemen caller
who's tired of eastern Europe

02:00.450 --> 02:02.730
wants to try a little
of your English rose.

02:02.730 --> 02:05.530
Oh, please! Apparently
your reviews speak for themselves.

02:07.410 --> 02:09.289
No, I don't wanna do it.

02:09.889 --> 02:11.930
Is that your final answer?
Yeah.

02:11.930 --> 02:14.730
Sorry you had a wasted journey,
but I'm not interested.

02:14.730 --> 02:19.770
Shame. Well, you know where I am
if you er...change your mind.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.610
Can you help me?

02:33.890 --> 02:35.890
There you go. You look great.
Really?

02:35.890 --> 02:38.730
Wish I could come and watch you.
Ah, medical conference,

02:38.730 --> 02:41.970
it's beyond dull. It's a morning
of consultants and old buffers.

02:41.970 --> 02:44.450
Yeah, it beats shredding
at MH-fucking-Credit.

02:44.450 --> 02:46.370
Right. Come on, let's go.
Yeah.

02:48.490 --> 02:50.490
Bye.
Bye.

02:50.490 --> 02:52.450
# There's nowhere to go but on

02:53.170 --> 02:55.210
# Heart on my sleeve

02:55.210 --> 02:57.250
# Not where it should be

02:57.250 --> 02:59.210
# The song's out of key again

03:00.930 --> 03:02.970
# Take it slow

03:02.970 --> 03:05.010
# Take it easy on me

03:05.010 --> 03:06.970
# And shed some light #

03:09.850 --> 03:11.810
I know. Not great.

03:12.690 --> 03:15.650
But I will tell him.
I just need to get another job first.

03:18.410 --> 03:20.330
Er, it's hopeless.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.370
Completely unemployable.

03:25.490 --> 03:27.250
I'm losing it, you know.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.970
Come ON.
There must be something you can do.

03:29.970 --> 03:33.130
Look. Let's look at what
we're working with, all right?

03:33.130 --> 03:35.330
You're a 20-something arts graduate.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.530
And...what are your skills, exactly?

03:39.490 --> 03:41.810
I can put a condom on
without using my hands.

03:42.930 --> 03:46.890
I don't even know what half of these
jobs are and they're all shitty pay.

03:46.890 --> 03:49.690
And horrible bosses.
The same thing day after day -

03:49.690 --> 03:51.410
So freelance.

03:51.410 --> 03:54.050
Lucrative. Preferably sex-based.

03:55.210 --> 03:57.930
If not actually having sex,
then talking about it.

03:58.650 --> 04:02.050
Sex therapist.
Ugh, listening to people.

04:02.730 --> 04:04.770
Asking questions.

04:04.770 --> 04:07.450
Agony aunt. Writer. Writer!

04:07.450 --> 04:10.530
Writer? Yeah. Yeah, why not?
Write about what you know.

04:10.530 --> 04:13.290
No. Come on,
you must have loads to write about.

04:13.290 --> 04:16.610
It's hopeless. This is why I started
escorting in the first place.

04:16.610 --> 04:20.329
There's nothing I wanted to do that
paid as well for so few hours.

04:20.850 --> 04:22.690
So you're gonna go back to it.

04:22.690 --> 04:25.290
You're talking about it like that.
No. No, I...

04:25.290 --> 04:27.050
I can't.

04:27.050 --> 04:29.650
You know, and I don't want to.
I've got Alex now.

04:29.650 --> 04:31.610
And that's all I need.

04:41.210 --> 04:44.930
Excuse me. I'm looking for Hannah
Baxter. She works for MH Credit.

04:44.930 --> 04:46.890
Oh, she doesn't work here any more.

05:23.770 --> 05:25.490
Once...

05:25.490 --> 05:27.450
..upon a time...

05:28.290 --> 05:30.890
..there was an escort...

05:31.890 --> 05:35.050
..called...Belle.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.210
Like all working girls

05:40.210 --> 05:42.970
Belle had her favourite clients.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.730
The ones she would find hard
to give up.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.010
Ashok.

05:53.090 --> 05:55.610
I knew there was something
I missed about London.

05:55.610 --> 05:58.010
Congestion Charge? Black cabs?

05:58.010 --> 05:59.810
No.

05:59.810 --> 06:01.930
So, how was New York?

06:01.930 --> 06:03.770
Seductive.

06:03.770 --> 06:06.530
Expensive.
There's nothing wrong with that.

06:06.530 --> 06:08.370
You can be in
the best place in the world

06:08.370 --> 06:10.210
but you're still
chained to your desk.

06:10.210 --> 06:12.370
You know,
I almost feel sorry for you.

06:12.370 --> 06:14.330
That's what I wanted.

06:16.010 --> 06:18.450
Come on.
God, I've missed you.

06:19.450 --> 06:21.490
Six months away.

06:21.490 --> 06:23.450
The whole time I thought about you.

06:24.210 --> 06:26.250
Imagined you.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.210
Us.

06:29.850 --> 06:31.890
And here you are.

06:31.890 --> 06:33.930
And it's true.

06:33.930 --> 06:36.010
You're flawless.

06:36.010 --> 06:38.010
You're just not looking
closely enough.

06:38.010 --> 06:41.410
No. There's no one else
who can do what you do to me.

06:41.410 --> 06:43.450
# Fever

06:43.450 --> 06:45.410
# Ooh

06:49.130 --> 06:51.090
# Ooh

06:51.410 --> 06:53.450
# You give me fever

06:53.450 --> 06:55.490
# Fever in the morning

06:55.490 --> 06:57.970
# Fever when it's late at night

06:57.970 --> 06:59.930
# He give me fever

07:00.370 --> 07:02.410
# Fever when you kiss me

07:02.410 --> 07:04.770
# Fever when you hold me tight

07:04.770 --> 07:06.810
# You give me fever

07:06.810 --> 07:09.010
# Fever in the evening

07:09.010 --> 07:11.450
# Fever all through the night

07:11.450 --> 07:13.930
# Give me fever, ey

07:13.930 --> 07:15.650
# Fever when you're with me

07:15.650 --> 07:18.370
# Fever when you love me

07:18.370 --> 07:20.850
# He's so sweet

07:20.850 --> 07:23.930
# He's so good to me

07:24.890 --> 07:27.130
# He's so intelligent

07:28.050 --> 07:30.450
# He's so confident #

07:33.450 --> 07:35.730
To the client I'm a treat.

07:37.050 --> 07:39.010
A luxury.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.170
Something special.

07:43.650 --> 07:45.970
We should go. Together.

07:45.970 --> 07:47.690
New York.

07:47.690 --> 07:49.490
A weekend away.

07:49.490 --> 07:51.210
On me.

07:51.210 --> 07:53.290
You'll buy me pancakes?

07:53.290 --> 07:55.330
You do what you just did to me
again...

07:55.330 --> 07:57.410
..I'll MAKE you pancakes.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.450
(PHONE)
Belle?

07:59.450 --> 08:01.490
Hm?
Your phone.

08:01.490 --> 08:03.410
(PHONE)
Hm?

08:07.490 --> 08:09.330
Hello?
You're gonna kill me,

08:09.330 --> 08:11.690
but I need to meet you
in Grimsby at half two.

08:11.690 --> 08:14.290
What? There's a guy
who comes to the bar, James.

08:14.290 --> 08:16.130
He's a publisher's assistant.

08:16.130 --> 08:18.330
His boss might be interested
in your book.

08:18.330 --> 08:20.290
No. W-w-what book?

08:20.290 --> 08:24.010
The one you're writing. I told him
you're a middle class ex-schoolgirl

08:24.010 --> 08:26.290
and it's all a big
secret and everything.

08:26.290 --> 08:28.290
And his eyes lit up.
Ben!

08:28.290 --> 08:30.250
Whoa, it's OK, it's just a chat.

08:30.890 --> 08:33.929
He said he can't promise anything,
but it's worth a try.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.850
No, I'm not going.
Don't be ridiculous.

08:35.850 --> 08:38.210
Hannah, I've gotta go.
I'll see you there. I'll -

08:38.210 --> 08:40.130
No!
Don't be late.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.890
Shit.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.570
Shit!

08:49.450 --> 08:52.410
Hiya. It's Ben and Belle.
We've got a meeting with James.

08:52.970 --> 08:55.490
He's just on another call.
Please, take a seat.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.210
Thanks.

09:03.290 --> 09:06.370
Could be you. You and Melv,
pressing the flesh.

09:06.370 --> 09:08.450
Don't, Ben. Don't what?
Joke about this.

09:08.450 --> 09:10.410
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

09:10.410 --> 09:12.730
You're here
because you wanna write a book.

09:12.730 --> 09:14.490
No... Hey.

09:14.490 --> 09:16.290
You want me to write a book.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.650
You're so fucking desperate
for me to go straight.

09:19.290 --> 09:22.610
What?
You pretend to be OK with what I do.

09:22.610 --> 09:24.650
What I did. What I DID.

09:24.650 --> 09:27.210
But you're not.
And this is, I dunno,

09:27.210 --> 09:29.770
this is like some way
of kind of legitimising it.

09:30.490 --> 09:32.490
That's bullshit.
My friend's an escort

09:32.490 --> 09:34.450
but it's OK, she writes about it.

09:34.450 --> 09:37.810
Bollocks! You know what? I have
kept this a secret for years.

09:37.810 --> 09:41.450
I haven't told anyone. And now you
want me to just let them all in.

09:41.450 --> 09:44.210
So they can read and point -
Hannah, will you - Don't!

09:44.890 --> 09:46.810
Where are you going?
I'm going.

09:51.650 --> 09:53.650
Might have to reschedule.

09:53.650 --> 09:59.010
# You've been too far

10:00.850 --> 10:06.650
# You live too fast

10:11.890 --> 10:15.410
Alex, it's me. Can you call me as
soon as you can, please? Cheers.

10:15.410 --> 10:19.210
# You're a tragedy starting to happen

10:21.850 --> 10:23.810
One last job?

10:29.210 --> 10:31.850
Apparently, your reviews
speak for themselves.

10:32.690 --> 10:35.770
Alex, can you please call me back?
I really need to talk.

10:35.770 --> 10:38.210
You know where I am,
if you er change your mind.

10:38.890 --> 10:41.170
# Don't make those promises

10:41.170 --> 10:43.130
# That is how you go #

10:49.450 --> 10:51.410
(PHONE)

10:52.570 --> 10:54.610
Hello?
You left a message.

10:54.610 --> 10:57.690
Yeah. What do you want?
I've gotta get back to theatre.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.210
Alex...I love you.

11:01.490 --> 11:03.530
Mm-hm.
You know that, don't you?

11:03.530 --> 11:06.090
I've gotta go.
We should - Please can you -

11:06.090 --> 11:08.050
Don't work too hard.

11:10.410 --> 11:12.490
Well, well, well.

11:12.490 --> 11:14.450
Forgive me
if I don't look surprised.

11:25.030 --> 11:27.110
Ah, escorts.

11:27.110 --> 11:30.510
They're like boxers. Retire every
year, then surface for a rematch

11:30.510 --> 11:33.870
a little fatter, more desperate,
and further down the rankings.

11:33.870 --> 11:35.870
Who's the client?
What's it matter?

11:35.870 --> 11:38.270
It matters to me.
Well, his name is Simon.

11:38.270 --> 11:41.270
He sounds American.
He's only in the city for a week.

11:41.270 --> 11:43.310
Why don't I call him?

11:43.310 --> 11:45.270
Name a price.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.790
Leave the rest to fate.

11:48.230 --> 11:50.630
Simon? It's Stephanie.

11:50.630 --> 11:53.910
I've had a word with Belle
and she's prepared to reconsider.

11:53.730 --> 11:55.690
Obviously on her own terms.

11:56.770 --> 11:59.170
One hour...Â£5,000.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.730
Absolutely. My pleasure.

12:05.290 --> 12:07.450
The Molton, 9:30pm it is, then.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.210
The Royal Suite. Bye.

12:12.290 --> 12:13.930
Yes.

12:15.970 --> 12:17.690
Don't worry.

12:17.690 --> 12:19.650
They say it's like riding a bike.

12:22.970 --> 12:25.010
Belle! Hey.

12:25.010 --> 12:27.010
You've thought about this, have you?

12:27.610 --> 12:29.930
What are you doing?
One last job.

12:29.930 --> 12:32.010
Yeah, but, what if it isn't?

12:32.010 --> 12:34.450
What if you can't give up?
What if Alex finds out?

12:34.450 --> 12:36.370
Alex won't find out.
But he might.

12:36.850 --> 12:39.810
Bloody hell, babes, I saw you
when you were split up

12:39.810 --> 12:43.050
and...you were lost. No, no,
you don't do this, all right?

12:43.050 --> 12:45.570
You don't tell me what to do
or how I feel.

12:45.570 --> 12:47.490
You're nothing like me, Bambi.

12:58.490 --> 13:01.330
I'm not being funny.
I know she's your mate, but...

13:01.330 --> 13:04.650
..she was really horrible to me.
And I was only trying to help.

13:05.370 --> 13:07.290
What?
You know...

13:07.290 --> 13:11.210
Make sure she'd really thought about
it. Make sure he's bloody worth it.

13:11.210 --> 13:13.170
Bambi, what are you talking about?

13:13.290 --> 13:15.250
She is taking a booking.

13:15.530 --> 13:17.490
9:30 tonight.

13:24.290 --> 13:26.250
This is a sensible decision.

13:27.130 --> 13:29.170
Â£5,000.

13:29.170 --> 13:31.210
It's a lot of cash.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.170
And I'm only doing it for the cash.

13:36.730 --> 13:38.690
It's not like anyone'll know.

13:42.370 --> 13:44.810
There's always anxiety
when you take a break.

13:45.370 --> 13:48.210
First day back at the office,
first day back at term.

13:51.170 --> 13:53.290
I'll just see if the uniform
still fits.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.570
What?
These ones are bloody expensive.

14:11.970 --> 14:14.410
You're really worried about her,
aren't you?

14:16.330 --> 14:18.290
No.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.770
Do you think we should
go and do something?

14:22.970 --> 14:26.090
She's a big girl, Bambi.
It's not up to us.

14:27.370 --> 14:29.810
I just don't think she knows
what she's doing.

14:36.050 --> 14:38.010
# Piece by piece

14:39.210 --> 14:42.650
# Is how I'll let go of you

14:43.170 --> 14:45.250
# Kiss by kiss

14:45.250 --> 14:48.930
# Will leave my mind one at a time

14:49.730 --> 14:51.690
# One at a time

14:57.010 --> 14:58.970
There's no other job like it.

15:01.770 --> 15:06.530
Maybe actors waiting for the curtain
or athletes before the gun.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.570
That feeling. The butterflies,
the knot in the stomach.

15:11.730 --> 15:13.690
I've missed this part the most.

15:14.490 --> 15:16.250
The mystery.

15:16.250 --> 15:19.370
Who will be on the other side
of the door and what will he want?

15:19.370 --> 15:23.610
# Is how I'll let go of you

15:23.610 --> 15:26.530
# Kiss by kiss

15:26.530 --> 15:30.010
# Will leave my mind one at a time

15:30.650 --> 15:32.450
# One at a time

15:32.450 --> 15:34.250
# One at a time

15:34.250 --> 15:39.130
# One at a time #

15:51.130 --> 15:53.170
Bit dressed up for the office.

15:58.690 --> 16:01.770
I didn't want you to come.
I'd hoped that you wouldn't.

16:03.970 --> 16:05.930
But I knew you would.

16:09.570 --> 16:12.650
Because I think that you...
love this job.

16:13.690 --> 16:15.650
More than you love me.

16:19.530 --> 16:21.810
And when you stopped...

16:23.050 --> 16:25.210
..it was like
a light had gone out in you.

16:35.530 --> 16:37.970
You look like you looked
when I first met you.

16:37.970 --> 16:40.090
The...the hair and the make-up.

16:43.650 --> 16:45.610
It's a different hotel, though.

16:46.650 --> 16:48.690
It's cheaper.

16:48.690 --> 16:50.650
I'm a rich American, remember?

16:55.650 --> 16:57.490
I didn't...

16:57.490 --> 16:59.210
..want any of this.

16:59.210 --> 17:01.170
But...

17:01.810 --> 17:03.770
I wanted Hannah.

17:04.730 --> 17:06.369
I didn't want Belle.

17:07.410 --> 17:09.369
They're one and the same.

17:20.530 --> 17:22.369
We never quite got it right, did we?

17:30.730 --> 17:32.690
We got everything right.

17:44.810 --> 17:46.770
# First of all must go

17:48.010 --> 17:50.890
# Your scent upon my pillow

17:51.970 --> 17:54.090
# And then I say goodbye

17:54.090 --> 17:57.010
# To your whispers in my dreams

17:58.930 --> 18:02.210
# And then our lips will part

18:03.130 --> 18:06.130
# In my mind and in my heart

18:06.130 --> 18:08.090
# Cos your kiss

18:08.970 --> 18:11.810
# Went deeper than my skin

18:14.570 --> 18:16.610
# Piece by piece

18:17.530 --> 18:21.370
# Is how I'll let go of you

18:21.370 --> 18:24.170
# Kiss by kiss

18:24.170 --> 18:27.610
# Will leave my mind one at a time

18:29.330 --> 18:31.290
Babes.

18:32.890 --> 18:34.850
You all right?

18:35.810 --> 18:38.170
Come on,
we're really worried about you.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.850
# Kiss by kiss

18:42.850 --> 18:46.410
# Will leave my mind one at a time

18:47.330 --> 18:49.210
# One at a time

18:49.210 --> 18:51.090
# One at a time

18:51.090 --> 18:53.410
# One at a time #

19:21.730 --> 19:23.770
You can stay if you want.

19:23.770 --> 19:26.570
My bed. Promise I won't touch you.

19:28.770 --> 19:31.290
Got the line down the middle.
I won't cross it.

19:31.290 --> 19:33.650
Good. You're a terrible shag.

19:37.850 --> 19:39.810
I'm glad you're here.

19:41.610 --> 19:44.690
# It looked like May in June

19:46.730 --> 19:50.370
# All the same, I miss you

19:51.930 --> 19:55.490
# Today has been OK

19:57.370 --> 20:00.250
# Today has been OK

20:07.730 --> 20:09.890
# Preacher lost his son

20:12.850 --> 20:15.570
# He's known by all in town #

20:20.570 --> 20:22.890
The first thing
you should know about me...

20:23.890 --> 20:25.850
..is that I'm a whore.

20:29.330 --> 20:31.170
In escorting...

20:31.170 --> 20:33.050
..as in life...

20:33.050 --> 20:35.610
..you don't always get
the ending you expect...

20:37.690 --> 20:40.330
..but it helps
if you write your own story.

20:58.170 --> 21:00.130
Studio two.

21:01.810 --> 21:04.690
Bloody hell, babes,
you look like a transvestite.

21:05.570 --> 21:07.330
Thanks, Bambi.

21:07.330 --> 21:09.130
A pretty one.
Yeah.

21:09.130 --> 21:11.090
Yeah, thanks for your support.

21:28.770 --> 21:31.410
Today sees
the much anticipated publication

21:31.410 --> 21:33.530
of The Secret Life
Of A London Call Girl.

21:34.250 --> 21:38.250
Tell us, how does it feel to be
the latest literary sensation?

21:38.250 --> 21:40.210
Actually, it feels pretty good.

21:40.690 --> 21:43.330
When you're working as an escort

21:43.330 --> 21:47.570
how do you manage
to keep your emotional life
separate from your work?

21:48.090 --> 21:50.690
Er...it's...it's difficult.

21:50.690 --> 21:53.450
It's probably the hardest part
of my job.

21:54.170 --> 21:56.130
Have you ever been in love?

21:57.690 --> 21:59.650
Yes. Once.

22:00.530 --> 22:02.610
It was wonderful.

22:02.610 --> 22:04.570
I didn't actually think
I had it in me.

22:06.410 --> 22:08.370
And then it broke my heart.

22:09.330 --> 22:12.890
Do you think, now that you've found
this new career,

22:12.890 --> 22:15.690
you'd ever see yourself
giving up escorting?

22:18.850 --> 22:20.810
Never.

22:24.690 --> 22:26.650
A girl's gotta do her research.

22:28.850 --> 22:30.770
