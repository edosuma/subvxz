00:12.078 --> 00:14.647
I'm Jimmy Carr.
Welcome to Drunk History,

00:14.647 --> 00:17.250
the show that brings you
genuine stories...

00:17.250 --> 00:19.285
Where's the tomb at?
Boom!

00:19.285 --> 00:22.255
Nicki Minaj is down there.
She's butt-naked.

00:22.255 --> 00:24.958
...as told by blind drunk comedians.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.493
Nice to be on television!

00:26.493 --> 00:30.363
If this were a real history lesson,
Ofsted would be all over this shit.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.399
Go fuck yourself, bredren.

00:32.399 --> 00:35.235
So stayed tuned if you like
your history on the rocks.

00:35.235 --> 00:38.505
I'm fucking bringing the real shit
right now.

00:38.505 --> 00:40.807
Oh, bollocks.
Shh!

00:40.807 --> 00:44.944
He had a fucking bear!
It's not fun. Shit can happen.

00:44.944 --> 00:46.946
What am I supposed to do now?

00:58.124 --> 01:01.928
We begin with the story of Romesh
Ranganathan about Tutankhamun.

01:01.928 --> 01:05.265
I doubt like he'll be walking
like an Egyptian after the show.

01:05.265 --> 01:06.366
Or walking at all.

01:06.366 --> 01:10.103
After eight beers and three shots
of sambuca, not surprising.

01:14.774 --> 01:20.547
Basically, the story is about how
you shouldn't mess with the dead.

01:20.547 --> 01:25.452
You might be thinking, you're just
superstitious. But shit went down.

01:25.452 --> 01:30.523
So the story is it's happened
in 1922, I believe.

01:30.523 --> 01:34.127
1922, just off the top of my head.
Just threw that date out there.

01:34.127 --> 01:38.465
In Egypt, Howard Carter,
an Egyptologist,

01:38.465 --> 01:41.935
basically like a shit Indiana Jones.
That's who that dude is.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.905
He spent his time in the Valley Of
Kings try to find Tutankhamun.

01:45.905 --> 01:51.110
He's been financed by Lord Carnarvon.
He's an archaeologist, apparently,

01:51.110 --> 01:54.814
but not a real archaeologist because
he's paying people to do it.

01:54.814 --> 01:58.585
If you were Carnarvon at this point,
you've thrown money at this prick

01:58.585 --> 02:01.788
and he's not found Tutankhamun's
tomb, I'd be pissed off.

02:01.788 --> 02:05.091
"Dude, if you don't find it,
I'm gonna fucking merk you, mate,

02:05.091 --> 02:10.163
because, like, I've spent so much
money on sending you out here."

02:10.163 --> 02:12.131
"Like, I've paid for everything."

02:12.131 --> 02:16.536
You know breakfast? Paid for it. That
lunch you had later on? Paid for it.

02:16.536 --> 02:20.306
"You know what didn't happen?
You didn't find Tutankhamun."

02:20.306 --> 02:23.510
"Where's the tomb at?
All I asked for was one tomb."

02:24.811 --> 02:27.313
So obviously Carnarvon is screwing,
like,

02:27.313 --> 02:30.717
"Dude, if Carter doesn't find it
in the next 24 hours,

02:30.717 --> 02:33.653
I'm gonna call some boys
and beat the shit out of him."

02:33.653 --> 02:36.055
Even if you've spent
that amount of money,

02:36.055 --> 02:39.526
you can have a laugh watching
Howard Carter get his arse kicked.

02:39.526 --> 02:43.196
Who wouldn't wanna watch Indiana
Jones get his arse handed to him?

02:43.196 --> 02:45.865
What happens is Carter is desperate.

02:45.865 --> 02:49.402
Of course he's gonna be desperate.
"I've got to find the tomb."

02:49.402 --> 02:53.473
Then they decide that they're gonna
look under some rubble.

02:53.473 --> 02:56.676
I don't know if Carter doesn't know
his arse from his elbow.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.745
He's gonna look under some rubbish.

02:58.745 --> 03:01.748
He's been doing a proper excavation
and suddenly goes,

03:01.748 --> 03:06.486
"I'm gonna look under that dog shit
and see if the tomb is over there."

03:06.486 --> 03:09.923
So then Carter discards some rubbish.

03:09.923 --> 03:13.092
Unbelievable, mate, boom.

03:13.092 --> 03:15.895
Carter fucking finds it.
Tutankhamun. Finds it.

03:15.895 --> 03:18.531
Obviously he's got a semi on now
because, like,

03:18.531 --> 03:21.267
Carnarvon's been giving him
loads of pressure.

03:21.267 --> 03:24.771
He opens the gate or door. I don't
know what the fuck opens a tomb.

03:26.806 --> 03:30.109
Then he opens the tomb,
has a look down there.

03:30.109 --> 03:32.879
Then Carnarvon says,
"What do you see?"

03:32.879 --> 03:35.882
He's frustrated at this point.
"What's down there?"

03:35.882 --> 03:38.551
Carter's like,
"I see such wonderful things."

03:38.551 --> 03:40.787
I mean, you have to say that, mate.

03:40.787 --> 03:44.123
I'd be like,
"Dude, honestly, fucking hell."

03:44.123 --> 03:46.826
"Nicki Minaj is down there,
she's butt-naked."

03:46.826 --> 03:49.529
Blatantly you're gonna say that.

03:49.529 --> 03:53.132
"Oh, my God. She's got a sign
here saying 'I love Carnarvon'."

03:53.132 --> 03:57.804
You're gonna say that cos Carnarvon's
invested so much money in you.

03:57.804 --> 04:01.507
Carnarvon, he goes down there
like he's heading into the club.

04:01.507 --> 04:06.446
He's laughing his head off.
"What, what. We're gon' party."

04:06.446 --> 04:10.550
You can't do that when you walk into
a fucking tomb, mate!

04:10.550 --> 04:14.921
Some dude, journalists,
another Egyptologist.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.757
I think his name was Arthur Weigall.
He's going,

04:17.757 --> 04:21.928
"Listen, trust me, bredren, you can't
go down there like it's a party."

04:21.928 --> 04:24.564
"I swear he's going to get merked."

04:24.564 --> 04:28.401
He claimed it. He's gonna get merked.
Right? He said.

04:28.401 --> 04:31.804
And do you know what happened?
D'you know what happened?

04:31.804 --> 04:34.107
Dude. Dead.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.808
Dead, mate.

04:35.808 --> 04:37.710
Not only does Carnarvon die,

04:37.710 --> 04:42.949
his dog died at the same moment
during a blackout in Cairo.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.551
What?! Are you serious?!

04:45.551 --> 04:48.521
The dog! The dog died, mate.

04:48.521 --> 04:52.091
The dog hasn't even made a conscious
decision to go into the tomb.

04:52.091 --> 04:55.361
The world's press have gone to Egypt.

04:55.361 --> 04:59.799
The press were like, "Oh, my God,
we've opened Tutankhamun's womb."

04:59.799 --> 05:03.336
"Tomb. Whatever it is.
The thing. Omb."

05:03.336 --> 05:06.706
"They've opened it up and it's
released some sort of curse."

05:06.706 --> 05:11.110
"OK, Romesh, but I don't think that's
enough of a convincing argument."

05:11.110 --> 05:14.447
Let me just throw this shit at you,
little fucking asshole.

05:14.447 --> 05:17.984
Carnarvon's half brother,
Mervyn Herbert. Dead!

05:17.984 --> 05:20.753
Aubrey Herbert,
his other half brother. Dead!

05:20.753 --> 05:23.189
That's a whole brother. Dead!

05:23.189 --> 05:27.093
Carter's Secretary!
He didn't have nothing to do with it.

05:27.093 --> 05:29.729
He just typed the letters. Dead!

05:29.729 --> 05:33.566
Dead, mate! Merked.
Can you believe that shit?

05:33.566 --> 05:37.370
There's a curse!
Do you understand? A curse, mate!

05:38.705 --> 05:42.375
Yeah? You don't go fucking around
with someone's tomb.

05:42.375 --> 05:45.445
Are you getting my socks in this
shot? I don't want you to.

05:45.445 --> 05:49.449
You can if you want.
My sock game is pretty strong.

05:49.449 --> 05:53.319
Basically, the press were going
mental. They're fucking crazy.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.354
People are dying. Headlines like...

05:56.522 --> 05:58.524
That's one of the headlines.

06:03.396 --> 06:05.064
The Sun led with...

06:07.133 --> 06:10.336
Like, that was like...
All sorts of shit.

06:10.336 --> 06:12.305
Because people were dying.

06:12.305 --> 06:17.810
By 1935, the press had reported on
21 deaths

06:17.810 --> 06:22.315
related to the opening of
the tomb of Tutankhamun.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.784
So now I understand
what you're thinking.

06:24.784 --> 06:29.922
Shit.
Tutankhamun's curse killed 21 people.

06:31.124 --> 06:34.994
It's probably gonna kill Romesh
cos he's telling the story.

06:34.994 --> 06:38.865
It's probably gonna kill me because
I'm watching Romesh tell the story

06:38.865 --> 06:41.868
about the 21 deaths. Shit.
Tutankhamun's gonna get me.

06:41.868 --> 06:46.038
I understand why you're worried.
But understand this.

06:46.038 --> 06:50.243
It is bullshit!
The whole thing is a set-up.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.711
Let me explain to you why.

06:51.711 --> 06:55.515
When you break into the tomb of
Tutankhamun, it's a big deal.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.517
In 1922, that's a big deal.

06:57.517 --> 06:59.986
All the newspapers
want to hear about that.

06:59.986 --> 07:02.688
It's like Katie Price's
next marriage.

07:02.688 --> 07:05.792
So Carnarvon,
being a shrewd little dude,

07:05.792 --> 07:09.328
"You want a piece of this?
Who's gonna pay the most skrilla?"

07:09.328 --> 07:13.132
The Times went, "You know what?
We've got that cheddar for you."

07:13.132 --> 07:16.402
So he looked up an exclusive deal
with The Times.

07:16.402 --> 07:19.005
All the other newspapers,
they got jealous.

07:19.005 --> 07:22.108
They wanna throw some shade on
Tutankhamun.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.844
So the other journalists
are sitting around like,

07:24.844 --> 07:27.313
"Dude, what are we gonna do?
It's shit."

07:27.313 --> 07:30.783
"I thought the Tutankhamun thing
was gonna be a big story for me."

07:30.783 --> 07:33.586
"I'm annoyed about it."

07:33.586 --> 07:36.322
One of the journalists goes,
"Hold on a minute."

07:36.322 --> 07:39.158
"Do you know what I thought about?"
"What?"

07:39.158 --> 07:42.395
"You know Carnarvon?
Carnarvon's dead, right."

07:42.395 --> 07:43.996
"Shit, yeah, you're right."

07:43.996 --> 07:47.200
"Do you know who else is dead?"
"Who else is dead, bruv?"

07:47.200 --> 07:50.336
"His dog."
"What?"

07:50.336 --> 07:53.272
"I didn't know his dog was dead.
Are you serious?"

07:53.272 --> 07:57.210
"They don't report that because
people don't care about animals."

07:57.210 --> 08:00.446
"That's sad."
"I know. And it's a shame."

08:00.446 --> 08:03.482
"Do you not think it's a coinky-dink

08:03.482 --> 08:07.653
that Carnarvon and the dog is dead
and there's a blackout in Cairo?"

08:07.653 --> 08:10.556
"Really, there's a blackout in Cairo?
For real?"

08:10.556 --> 08:12.825
"But Cairo has blackouts
all the time."

08:12.825 --> 08:16.562
"Shut up, man! We're trying to make
a story out of this, you prick!"

08:16.562 --> 08:20.333
"Dog, Carnarvon, blackout.
Are you an idiot?"

08:20.333 --> 08:22.435
"Oh, my God.
I think there's a curse."

08:22.435 --> 08:25.504
"Tutankhamun's come up
and just mashed up the place."

08:25.504 --> 08:29.675
The curse is a load of bullshit.
The press just threw it together.

08:29.675 --> 08:33.044
There's coincidences
for every one of those things.

08:33.044 --> 08:37.515
Carnarvon, he died during
a blackout in Cairo.

08:37.515 --> 08:40.720
Do you know what would be
more impressive?

08:40.720 --> 08:43.389
Carnarvon dying when
there wasn't a blackout.

08:43.389 --> 08:46.492
Practically 24 hours a day
it was a blackout at that time.

08:46.492 --> 08:51.330
Carnarvon's half brother,
he had some dental infection

08:51.330 --> 08:53.766
and got a blood poisoning
or whatever.

08:53.766 --> 08:56.936
The secretary got smothered
with a pillow.

08:56.936 --> 08:58.838
Right? That's not Tutankhamun.

08:58.838 --> 09:01.707
Tutankhamun didn't rock up
with a pillow, mate.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.343
It's fucking whatever.
You're done, mate.

09:04.343 --> 09:08.147
But what you're thinking about is
he hasn't mentioned Howard Carter.

09:08.147 --> 09:10.416
Howard Carter's the dude
that broke in.

09:10.416 --> 09:14.720
Howard Carter died years later, man.
He died years later.

09:14.720 --> 09:19.125
Then you're thinking, hold on
a minute, is there a twist to this?

09:19.125 --> 09:23.930
Maybe the punishment
for Howard Carter

09:23.930 --> 09:28.134
was seeing all these people
die around him.

09:28.134 --> 09:32.104
All the people that are involved in
the Tutankhamun excavation.

09:32.104 --> 09:33.906
Maybe that was his punishment.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.408
Don't be a prick, mate.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.944
It's made up, innit?
D'you know what I mean?

09:37.944 --> 09:41.747
Howard Carter was living like a king.
"Fuck it, Carnarvon's gone."

09:41.747 --> 09:44.550
"This guy's been on my back
from fucking day one."

09:44.550 --> 09:47.520
"I managed to con him
out of some money."

09:47.520 --> 09:49.522
"I'm sick of Tutankhamun."

09:50.523 --> 09:53.526
Listen, to everyone.
Big up yourselves.

09:53.526 --> 09:56.329
Tutankhamun.
Go fuck yourself, bredren.

10:01.133 --> 10:05.304
I don't believe in you curse, mate.
Come get me. Come get me, you prick.

10:12.812 --> 10:15.281
He might have been cynical
about the curse,

10:15.281 --> 10:18.951
but immediately after telling that
story, Romesh's phone died.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.252
Coincidence?

10:20.252 --> 10:22.788
That's it for part one.
Join us after the break

10:22.788 --> 10:26.892
for Joe Lycett and the biggest dick
in British history.

10:33.199 --> 10:37.403
Welcome back to Drunk History, the
show that Time Team could have been

10:37.403 --> 10:39.605
if only they'd had more Jaegerbombs.

10:39.605 --> 10:42.208
Dead! There's a curse!

10:43.809 --> 10:46.812
Time for our next story.
If you thought Dick Turpin

10:46.812 --> 10:49.915
was something you might catch
if you didn't wear a condom,

10:49.915 --> 10:51.183
then you were wrong.

10:51.183 --> 10:55.187
Let hear a tale of the most
famous highwayman in history.

10:55.187 --> 10:57.556
Here's a giddy Joe Lycett
to tell us about it

10:57.556 --> 11:00.092
after a bellyful of bubbly
and a shot of sambuca.

11:02.294 --> 11:03.362
Shh.

11:03.362 --> 11:04.430
Hello.

11:04.430 --> 11:08.601
This is the story of Dick Turpin,
a dandy highwayman,

11:08.601 --> 11:13.205
and the story as to
how he was taken down.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.712
God, that's horrible.

11:19.712 --> 11:22.481
So the year is 1730.

11:22.481 --> 11:26.585
There is a gentleman named
Richard Turpin.

11:26.585 --> 11:29.789
You may know him as Dick Turpin.

11:32.691 --> 11:35.127
Which is also a name for a penis.

11:35.127 --> 11:39.598
So Dick Turpin would stop someone and
he'd go, "Your money or your life!"

11:39.598 --> 11:42.802
And people would go,
"Well, that is quite the quandary."

11:42.802 --> 11:44.870
"What to do. Money or life."

11:44.870 --> 11:48.274
"Do you know what? I quite like
my life. Here, have my money."

11:48.274 --> 11:51.210
He's give money over to Dick Turpin
and he'd go,

11:51.210 --> 11:54.814
"Thank you very much, I feel like
you've made the right choice."

11:54.814 --> 11:59.752
"Have a great day and wonderful
lives. Lots of love, Dick Turpin."

11:59.752 --> 12:02.588
Then he'd go off
cos he had a very solid brand,

12:02.588 --> 12:06.892
so he wanted people to know
that he was Dick Turpin.

12:06.892 --> 12:12.965
So one day Dick Turpin is doing
his usual highwayman-ing things

12:12.965 --> 12:17.703
and he stops a gentleman and he goes,
"Your money or your life."

12:17.703 --> 12:20.005
And this guy pisses himself laughing.

12:20.005 --> 12:23.809
He's like, "Oh, my God,
this is the funniest thing."

12:23.809 --> 12:27.012
And Dick Turpin's like,
"Why are you laughing at me?"

12:27.012 --> 12:29.315
"I'm... I've got a gun to you."

12:29.315 --> 12:34.787
And the guy who's laughing is like,
"Listen, I'm also a highwayman."

12:34.787 --> 12:38.791
Dick Turpin is like, "No, shut up.
You're a highwayman?"

12:38.791 --> 12:40.759
Dick's like, "What's your name?"

12:40.759 --> 12:44.597
"My name's Tom King."
"Fuck off. You're Tom King?"

12:46.398 --> 12:48.801
They've got real great banter
going on.

12:48.801 --> 12:53.405
They hug and, like, one of them get
a bit too keen and touches him a bit.

12:53.405 --> 12:56.275
He's like, "No, that's not
what I was on about.""

12:56.275 --> 12:59.245
It's really great
and there's common ground there.

12:59.245 --> 13:02.615
And then Tom was like,
"We should get together."

13:02.615 --> 13:06.252
"We should work as a double act
and really hit the road."

13:07.920 --> 13:11.490
So they worked together for a while.
They were having a great time.

13:11.490 --> 13:15.694
They were robbing people,
they were shooting people to death,

13:15.694 --> 13:20.132
and then one day
it went horribly wrong.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.002
They stop a coach, they go,
"Your money or your life,"

13:23.002 --> 13:26.305
and the guy is like, "I'm not having
either of those options."

13:26.305 --> 13:30.009
So there was a bit of a brawl
and Tom sort of grappled him

13:30.009 --> 13:33.279
and they were fighting
and rolling around and all of that

13:33.279 --> 13:36.849
and Tom went, "Dick,
could you sort this out, please?"

13:36.849 --> 13:40.519
Dick was holding the gun.
Dick was like, "All right," and shot.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.188
He hit Tom.

13:42.188 --> 13:47.092
Tom was like,
"Oh, erm, could you try again?"

13:47.092 --> 13:49.361
"And maybe not hit me this time?"

13:49.361 --> 13:53.199
And Dick was like,
"Erm, I'll have another go."

13:53.199 --> 13:55.968
But... he wasn't confident.

13:57.803 --> 14:02.007
He shot Tom again.
And, erm, and Tom died.

14:03.409 --> 14:06.111
So things have gone pretty bad
for Dick.

14:06.111 --> 14:09.915
He has just killed his mate
and he's wanted for murder,

14:09.915 --> 14:15.988
and so he runs away to York and
he changes his name to John Palmer.

14:15.988 --> 14:20.426
Ooh. And he walks around confident
that nobody knows who he is.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.995
"Hello, I'm John Palmer."

14:22.995 --> 14:26.198
"Your money or your... er, wife."

14:26.198 --> 14:27.600
"Ha ha ha."

14:27.600 --> 14:28.734
That kind of thing.

14:28.734 --> 14:31.837
The thing with York is
there's very little to do.

14:31.837 --> 14:34.206
A lovely tea shop,
but that's about it.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.275
So he starts to steal horses.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.946
We know what Dick Turpin is like.
It starts to escalate.

14:40.946 --> 14:44.984
And then one night
he gets a little bit drunk

14:44.984 --> 14:48.520
and he gets into a bit of
an altercation with a man in a pub

14:48.520 --> 14:54.593
and there's a little bit of pushing
and shoving and slapping.

14:54.593 --> 14:56.595
And a light tickle.

14:56.595 --> 15:01.934
And he pulls out his gun
and shoots him in the cock.

15:01.934 --> 15:05.904
But not his actual cock.
He's got like a fighting cock.

15:05.904 --> 15:08.374
You know, like the bird.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.376
(laughs)

15:14.613 --> 15:17.249
So, the police come along and go,

15:17.249 --> 15:20.386
"You shot him in the cock,
that's a crime there."

15:20.386 --> 15:22.388
So they take him off to jail.

15:25.991 --> 15:27.626
I'm ******.

15:29.795 --> 15:34.600
So, jail is pretty shit. I don't
know you if you've been to jail,

15:34.600 --> 15:36.268
but what happens is

15:36.268 --> 15:41.240
you're not allowed anywhere
but the jail environment.

15:41.240 --> 15:45.010
So Dick is thinking, "Bloody hell."

15:45.010 --> 15:47.413
"I don't need this.
I've got to get out."

15:47.413 --> 15:49.114
"I'm going to write a letter."

15:49.114 --> 15:51.684
He writes a letter
to his brother-in-law.

15:51.684 --> 15:55.788
"Hello, get me out of prison.
Hope the kids are all right."

15:55.788 --> 16:00.292
"All of that stuff.
Lots of love... John Palmer."

16:03.595 --> 16:05.998
Sends it off.

16:05.998 --> 16:09.201
The brother-in-law goes,
"I don't know anyone in York."

16:09.201 --> 16:11.603
"That can eff right off."

16:11.603 --> 16:13.806
He sends it back to the post office.

16:13.806 --> 16:17.409
The postmaster,
and you won't believe this,

16:17.409 --> 16:23.415
I didn't believe it either,
is Dick Turpin's old teacher.

16:23.415 --> 16:28.187
So he's going through the mail. He
goes, "That's unusual handwriting."

16:28.187 --> 16:33.192
"Oh. Every time he writes the letter
Q,

16:33.192 --> 16:36.628
he just draws a little penis
on the end of it. That's unusual."

16:36.628 --> 16:38.864
"I don't know anyone else
who does that."

16:38.864 --> 16:42.401
"Do you know one person I know who
does that? Dick Turpin does."

16:42.401 --> 16:48.307
And he goes, "There's a reward
for getting him, which is £200."

16:48.307 --> 16:53.011
Now, £200 these days
is basically worth 25 grand.

16:53.011 --> 16:55.047
So what this guy did is he said,

16:55.047 --> 16:59.752
"D'you know what,
I'm gonna dob him in now."

16:59.752 --> 17:04.589
And so he said to the police,
"I know who this handwriting is."

17:04.589 --> 17:06.791
"It's Dick Turpin."

17:06.791 --> 17:09.528
The police said, "Fuck off, mate."

17:09.528 --> 17:14.266
But they go along anyway
and they go into his prison cell

17:14.266 --> 17:18.804
and they see all of these letters
in his handwriting.

17:18.804 --> 17:22.608
They're like, "Oh, my God.
Dick Turpin, we've got you."

17:22.608 --> 17:25.411
He's like, "Oh, shit."

17:25.411 --> 17:28.280
"Oh, have you got me for murder?
So what."

17:28.280 --> 17:31.717
"You'll just send me to Australia.
They've got a lovely climate

17:31.717 --> 17:34.787
and also kangaroos and I'd like
to have a photo with one."

17:34.787 --> 17:37.489
"Haha, the joke's on you."
And they're like,

17:37.489 --> 17:40.426
"No, we've got you
for horse thievery."

17:40.426 --> 17:43.962
He's like, "Phew.
What's the punishment for that?"

17:43.962 --> 17:46.231
And they're like, "Death."

17:47.232 --> 17:49.234
So he's like, "Oh, bollocks."

17:51.403 --> 17:56.208
So Dick arrives at
his inevitable death.

17:56.208 --> 17:59.411
He walks the steps to the gallows.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.480
The mist settles.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.282
The drums roll.

18:03.282 --> 18:07.986
He looks across at the hangman
and he goes, "Is it Tony?"

18:07.986 --> 18:10.355
And Tony was like, "Yeah, it's me."

18:10.355 --> 18:15.327
"We met when we were highwaymen.
Nice to see you. How are things?"

18:15.327 --> 18:18.797
"Highwayman stuff didn't work out
for me because, erm,

18:18.797 --> 18:23.435
we had a couple of kids. I was away a
lot and I was doing a lot of travel."

18:23.435 --> 18:27.005
"I just basically work here
killing people now."

18:27.005 --> 18:29.408
"So, you know,
everything's going well."

18:29.408 --> 18:33.345
"Enough about me, I've got to kill
you. Pop this rope around your neck."

18:33.345 --> 18:37.483
He popped the rope around his neck
and that was the end of Dick Turpin.

18:37.483 --> 18:41.987
So we caught Dick Turpin
based on his handwriting.

18:41.987 --> 18:46.592
One of the greatest highwaymen
of all time

18:46.592 --> 18:50.996
based on his mere penmanship.

18:57.002 --> 18:58.470
Bye-bye.

19:02.207 --> 19:04.009
You call that highway robbery?

19:04.009 --> 19:06.612
Try buying crisps at
Heston services on the M4.

19:06.612 --> 19:09.414
£1 for Frazzles?
You're having a laugh.

19:09.414 --> 19:13.318
Finally, here's a short story about
Lord Byron and his favourite pet.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.522
Tom Rosenthal drank the best part
of a bottle of whiskey

19:16.522 --> 19:18.156
before telling us about it.

19:18.156 --> 19:22.961
A lot of people love Lord Byron as
the best British poet of all time.

19:22.961 --> 19:26.765
But a lot of people don't know that
he was a massive animal lover.

19:26.765 --> 19:29.434
OK? He had all sorts of pets.

19:29.434 --> 19:33.572
The one pet you wouldn't believe
he had was a pet bear. OK?

19:33.572 --> 19:38.410
This bear, Bruin, went absolutely
everywhere with Lord Byron. OK?

19:38.410 --> 19:41.346
If he was going up the stairs,
the bear was with him.

19:41.346 --> 19:44.550
If he was going to Legoland,
bam, the bear was with him.

19:44.550 --> 19:47.052
So Lord Byron's got this bear
called Bruin.

19:47.052 --> 19:50.155
They get this little carriage
across town.

19:50.155 --> 19:51.957
Lord Byron's a bit of a joker.

19:51.957 --> 19:55.160
He was in his carriage with his bear.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.397
He picked up a cockney hitch-hiker,
yeah?

19:58.397 --> 20:02.768
He gets in the carriage
and old Lord Byron,

20:02.768 --> 20:05.771
it's him and his bear
and this cockney.

20:05.771 --> 20:08.840
And Lord Byron, he basically
pretends to fall asleep.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.444
He's doing this faux snoring.
(snores)

20:12.444 --> 20:15.547
And the cockney, he starts
trying to have some chat.

20:15.547 --> 20:18.350
He goes, "So what about
the Napoleon Bonaparte?"

20:18.350 --> 20:22.354
Then old Lord Byron is like...
(snores)

20:22.354 --> 20:26.291
He's pretending to be asleep. So he
starts trying to chat to this bear.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.560
(laughs)
He doesn't know he's a bear.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.829
It's dark. It's at night.
So he's like,

20:30.829 --> 20:34.366
"Oi, fella. What do you think
about that Napoleon Bonaparte?"

20:34.366 --> 20:38.036
The bear just goes... (grumbles)

20:38.036 --> 20:41.773
The cockney thinks,
"This bear's a bit of a prick."

20:41.773 --> 20:44.476
"He must be deaf."
That's what the cockney says.

20:44.476 --> 20:47.212
So he keeps chatting to him. He goes,

20:47.212 --> 20:51.516
"Oi. Oi, oi, oi.
You've got a really nice coat on."

20:51.516 --> 20:54.152
(laughs)

20:54.152 --> 20:57.155
He goes, "What a lovely nice
winter coat you've got."

20:57.155 --> 20:59.358
The bear is like, (grumbles).

20:59.358 --> 21:02.561
Bryon is like, (snores).
Faking asleep.

21:02.561 --> 21:05.998
The cockney is like,
"These two are a bunch of *****."

21:05.998 --> 21:07.065
(laughs)

21:07.065 --> 21:08.800
"They're not chatting to me."

21:08.800 --> 21:11.770
(laughs)

21:11.770 --> 21:17.376
Then daybreak and the light comes up
and the sun shines in

21:17.376 --> 21:20.145
and the cockney goes, "Fucking hell!"

21:20.145 --> 21:25.150
"It's a bear!
It's a fucking bear in the cab!"

21:27.552 --> 21:32.524
And he gets out, shitting his pants

21:32.524 --> 21:37.763
cos he just... he's just been
hanging out with a bear.

21:37.763 --> 21:40.365
Trying to chat about current affairs.

21:44.770 --> 21:47.773
Funny. That is funny, man.

21:50.609 --> 21:53.345
That's all we have time for.
Thanks for watching.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.881
If you do have a drink tonight,
just remember,

21:55.881 --> 22:00.185
what you know and what you say might
be two very different things indeed.

22:00.185 --> 22:01.186
Goodnight.
