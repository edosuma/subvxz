00:00.020 --> 00:01.420
Previously on "Major Crimes"...

00:01.522 --> 00:04.108
Last night, while traveling
home from a work session,

00:04.133 --> 00:07.359
my mother, Bonnie Pearl,
was assassinated in her car.

00:07.384 --> 00:09.352
Our, uh, primary suspect was Erik Walsh.

00:09.453 --> 00:11.521
<i>You think I was involved
because that bitch cost me</i>

00:11.622 --> 00:12.922
<i>everything I own.</i>

00:13.023 --> 00:14.791
Stan is Bonnie's sole heir.

00:14.816 --> 00:17.050
My mother was a vicious, ruthless machine

00:17.227 --> 00:19.028
who'd destroy anything
and everything in her path.

00:19.129 --> 00:20.229
Aiden... he fired me

00:20.254 --> 00:21.855
and said I couldn't use him
as a reference.

00:22.032 --> 00:24.000
If I leave here today
without your signature

00:24.101 --> 00:26.769
and a check covering
two months of Gus's pay,

00:26.870 --> 00:29.172
you have no idea how ugly
this is going to get.

00:29.273 --> 00:32.008
Craig Curtis is the one
you should be investigating.

00:32.109 --> 00:34.010
We have a new location
opening in Hollywood tonight.

00:34.111 --> 00:35.978
Consider yourselves invited.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.714
For the past month,
there have been dozens

00:37.815 --> 00:39.649
of incoming calls about Tackles

00:39.750 --> 00:42.452
designated by the cities
"Burbank/Dallas SA"

00:42.553 --> 00:43.920
with no phone numbers listed.

00:43.945 --> 00:46.847
I think we found our Dallas.
And her name is Vanessa.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.314
Okay, what happened?

01:11.415 --> 01:13.149
Front door was unlocked when we got here.

01:13.250 --> 01:14.317
No sign of forced entry,

01:14.418 --> 01:17.153
but, as you can see,
her place was trashed.

01:17.254 --> 01:20.350
Another dead woman with links to Tackles.

01:20.375 --> 01:21.504
Kendall?

01:21.529 --> 01:23.860
She has slight petechia and cyanosis.

01:23.885 --> 01:25.585
See the bluing of her eyelids and lips?

01:25.763 --> 01:27.930
To me, that suggests asphyxiation.

01:27.955 --> 01:30.924
Goes with this thin indentation
around her neck.

01:31.702 --> 01:34.704
It was too thin for Vanessa
to have been strangled by hand,

01:34.729 --> 01:36.630
but a plastic bag could have done it.

01:36.807 --> 01:37.974
If someone were able to tie the bag

01:37.999 --> 01:39.166
around her head and hold it the...

01:39.343 --> 01:40.610
- Commander!
- Whoa!

01:40.711 --> 01:41.978
Are you okay?

01:42.079 --> 01:43.479
Yeah.

01:43.504 --> 01:44.938
I just, uh...

01:44.963 --> 01:46.230
I just needed to sit down.

01:46.255 --> 01:48.089
Buzz, Buzz, uh, let's get her some water.

01:48.418 --> 01:51.120
Uh, Nolan, uh, call Andy.
Tell him to come pick her up.

01:51.221 --> 01:52.755
- Yes, sir.
- No, I don't need anyone to pick me up.

01:52.856 --> 01:54.490
No, no, no, no, no.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.982
I am the incident commander,

01:56.007 --> 01:58.642
and I will not have you
collapsing in my crime scene.

01:58.896 --> 02:01.831
Now, you are overdoing it.
I will call paramedics.

02:01.932 --> 02:03.633
- They can be here in 10 minutes.
- T-This is nothing, Lieutenant.

02:03.734 --> 02:05.668
This is a reaction to the new medication

02:05.769 --> 02:07.470
my doctor put me on. Thank you, Buzz.

02:07.571 --> 02:09.839
Now, there are two coasters here.

02:09.940 --> 02:13.176
Are we thinking that Vanessa
sat down with her killer?

02:13.277 --> 02:15.077
- You don't have to do...
- That's my theory.

02:15.102 --> 02:18.871
And we found a blue stem from
a broken glass near the couch.

02:19.049 --> 02:21.384
As if her hand couldn't let go
of what it was holding.

02:21.485 --> 02:24.153
Shards of the same color blue
are in the victim's fist.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.756
Uh, she gripped the glass
with her left hand

02:26.781 --> 02:28.014
and the couch with her right.

02:28.192 --> 02:29.692
Like she's glued in place.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.452
There's two coasters here.
Where is the other blue glass?

02:32.629 --> 02:34.063
I'll check the kitchen.

02:34.088 --> 02:38.792
Okay, okay. If Vanessa,
aka "Burbank/Dallas SA,"

02:38.817 --> 02:40.084
was being suffocated,

02:40.109 --> 02:41.643
why didn't she just drop the drink

02:41.972 --> 02:44.207
and then try to protect herself?

02:44.232 --> 02:45.999
Uh, her muscles tensed up, sir.

02:46.024 --> 02:48.059
Maybe another assailant held her down.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.218
Another phantom accomplice,
like Bonnie's second shooter?

02:50.243 --> 02:51.176
I don't believe that.

02:51.308 --> 02:53.058
Well, she has a router,

02:53.083 --> 02:55.718
but no laptop, notebook, iPad.

02:55.819 --> 02:57.520
The killer... took her devices?

02:57.621 --> 02:59.856
Couldn't find her wallet,
either, or her cell.

02:59.957 --> 03:01.490
Someone may have grabbed her purse, too.

03:01.592 --> 03:02.925
Again, just like Bonnie Pearl.

03:03.026 --> 03:04.227
Add to that pattern...

03:04.328 --> 03:05.995
Vanessa seemed unafraid of her killer.

03:06.096 --> 03:08.064
I mean, she served her murderer a drink.

03:08.165 --> 03:10.867
- Time of death?
- The body's in full rigor.

03:10.968 --> 03:13.402
Well, no shit, Sherlock.
She's stiff as a board.

03:13.503 --> 03:14.904
Uh, with liver temp,

03:15.005 --> 03:17.106
I'd say earlier...
between 11:00 and 3:00.

03:17.207 --> 03:18.708
Well, now we know
why she wasn't protesting

03:18.809 --> 03:20.476
in front of Tackles this evening.

03:20.577 --> 03:23.312
If she died before
the restaurant's grand opening,

03:23.413 --> 03:25.948
then everyone who attended it
is still suspect.

03:26.049 --> 03:28.117
Uh, sir, Lieutenant Flynn
will be here in 10.

03:29.419 --> 03:32.021
Uh, did someone mention
the missing books?

03:32.122 --> 03:33.856
This table behind the sofa
looks like it had

03:33.957 --> 03:36.158
a complete row of books on it
until very recently.

03:36.260 --> 03:39.262
Missing books? What was
our killer trying to find?

03:39.287 --> 03:40.654
Or hide.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.246
Vanessa has four purple glasses

03:42.499 --> 03:44.300
and four green glasses, just like these.

03:44.401 --> 03:46.168
But I only found two blue ones
in the cupboard.

03:46.270 --> 03:49.038
Well, the third blue glass
broke in Vanessa's hand.

03:49.139 --> 03:52.909
The fourth one walked out
the front door with our killer.

03:53.010 --> 03:55.978
Your life is at stake,
you put up a fight.

03:56.595 --> 03:58.680
And Vanessa just sat there.

03:59.249 --> 04:01.017
Why?

04:01.118 --> 04:03.486
Because she was stunned... a lot.

04:03.587 --> 04:06.122
There are 15 areas on the back
of her body and neck

04:06.223 --> 04:08.090
where she was shocked by a stun gun.

04:08.191 --> 04:10.660
- Stun gun? Why is there no...
- But there are no burn marks.

04:10.761 --> 04:12.395
I was just about to say that, Cami.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.720
Oh, go ahead.

04:13.897 --> 04:16.298
Well, there's no reason
to say it now, is there?

04:16.399 --> 04:19.869
Why is there no physical
evidence of this stun gun?

04:19.970 --> 04:21.303
The newest stun guns don't leave marks

04:21.404 --> 04:22.271
above the skin's surface.

04:22.372 --> 04:24.774
We don't <i>have the newest stun guns?</i>

04:24.875 --> 04:26.475
Ours are about 10 years out-of-date.

04:26.576 --> 04:29.245
Technology advances faster
than the L.A.P.D.'s budget.

04:29.346 --> 04:31.480
Also when I magnified

04:31.581 --> 04:34.984
this area of the victim's neck,
I found subcutaneous bruises,

04:35.085 --> 04:37.386
each exactly 1 1/2 inches apart...

04:37.487 --> 04:40.256
the same distance between
two prongs on a stun gun.

04:40.357 --> 04:41.924
Now, watch this.

04:42.025 --> 04:44.927
I got this from a deputy at County.

04:45.429 --> 04:47.296
See? It fits.

04:47.397 --> 04:50.733
And each time the stun gun was fired,

04:50.834 --> 04:52.735
the young lady's muscles contracted

04:52.836 --> 04:54.337
almost 20 times per second.

04:54.438 --> 04:57.073
So our murderer attacked Vanessa
from behind,

04:57.174 --> 04:58.641
managed to zap her

04:58.742 --> 05:01.911
while still getting
a plastic bag over her head.

05:02.012 --> 05:04.246
What a way to go,
especially if the killer

05:04.348 --> 05:05.948
was someone she trusted enough
to let in the house.

05:06.049 --> 05:08.417
Well, the murderer may have contacted her

05:08.518 --> 05:09.852
before dropping by.

05:09.953 --> 05:11.153
Her cellphone's missing,

05:11.254 --> 05:13.556
but we can still check
her incoming calls.

05:13.657 --> 05:15.324
Her texts, however...

05:15.425 --> 05:18.461
Let me talk to our intel guys,
see what they can find.

05:18.562 --> 05:21.130
Oh, and the last person I want
notified of Vanessa's death

05:21.231 --> 05:22.898
is her lawyer, Stan Pearl.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.690
No more impromptu press conferences.

05:26.737 --> 05:28.070
So, what now, Lieutenant?

05:28.095 --> 05:30.697
Well, we get the police
in Dover, Delaware,

05:30.874 --> 05:32.475
to notify her relatives,

05:32.576 --> 05:35.578
find out if they know something
that we don't...

05:35.679 --> 05:39.281
and then we talk to the rest
of the former Tackles employees.

05:39.383 --> 05:41.917
The last time I saw Vanessa was with you.

05:42.019 --> 05:44.920
She said she was gonna protest
with us at Tackles last night,

05:44.945 --> 05:46.645
but, not surprisingly, she never showed.

05:46.823 --> 05:48.057
Why "not surprisingly"?

05:48.158 --> 05:50.026
Sh-She doesn't like that
kind of attention.

05:50.127 --> 05:51.560
We had to beg her to come

05:51.585 --> 05:53.353
<i>to the press conference
at Bonnie's office.</i>

05:53.530 --> 05:55.331
<i>Also, it feels like
she's taking Bonnie's death</i>

05:55.356 --> 05:57.123
<i>harder than the rest of us.</i>

05:57.300 --> 05:59.468
<i>- She's not responding to our calls.
- Commander.</i>

05:59.493 --> 06:00.527
How are you feeling?

06:00.704 --> 06:03.239
Much better, Lieutenant.
The extra rest helped.

06:03.340 --> 06:05.107
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you see?

06:05.208 --> 06:06.776
Sharon Raydor slept in,

06:06.877 --> 06:09.245
- and the world didn't implode.
<i>- I mean, I get it,</i>

06:09.346 --> 06:10.946
<i>because her own family life
was so screwed up,</i>

06:11.048 --> 06:12.848
<i>and Bonnie was like a mom to her.</i>

06:12.949 --> 06:14.383
- So, what does Alex have to say?
<i>- Very tough, but very loving.</i>

06:14.484 --> 06:16.485
Well, she doesn't know about Vanessa yet.

06:16.586 --> 06:18.454
- Not sure how she'll take it.
<i>- Of course, the murder was so horrible,</i>

06:18.555 --> 06:21.323
and we're all having trouble
wrapping our minds around it.

06:22.426 --> 06:23.993
Did Vanessa go back home to Dover?

06:25.128 --> 06:27.120
Is she dropping out of the suit?

06:27.996 --> 06:29.465
Uh, no.

06:31.168 --> 06:33.202
No, the reason why

06:33.303 --> 06:36.254
you haven't heard back from Vanessa is...

06:38.040 --> 06:40.609
No. No.

06:41.011 --> 06:42.144
No, no, wait.

06:42.245 --> 06:46.082
We are very, very sorry.

06:48.078 --> 06:50.913
Vanessa died yesterday at home.

06:51.121 --> 06:52.755
We found her last night around...

06:52.856 --> 06:54.123
Oh, my God.

06:54.224 --> 06:56.858
She finally did it? She killed herself?

06:57.461 --> 07:00.329
Why would assume
she committed suicide, ma'am?

07:00.430 --> 07:02.398
Because a little bit
before we were fired,

07:02.423 --> 07:03.957
she got really...

07:04.134 --> 07:05.701
really depressed. She had insomnia.

07:05.802 --> 07:08.637
The doctor ended up prescribing
<i>her an antidepressant.</i>

07:08.738 --> 07:10.139
<i>And this one night,</i>

07:10.240 --> 07:12.174
<i>she ended up taking
all the pills at once.</i>

07:12.275 --> 07:14.343
Vanessa Blaine attempted suicide?

07:14.444 --> 07:16.979
Okay, this is not a good surprise.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.538
We need to find out everything we can

07:18.563 --> 07:20.764
about what was going on in Vanessa's life

07:21.017 --> 07:22.952
right before she was fired.

07:23.053 --> 07:24.553
Well, Chief Mason's still working

07:24.654 --> 07:26.655
on getting cloud backups on her devices.

07:26.756 --> 07:28.691
<i>Brin was living with her at the time</i>

07:28.792 --> 07:31.227
<i>and came home earlier than expected</i>

07:31.328 --> 07:33.963
and ended up having to drag her
all the way to the E.R.

07:34.064 --> 07:36.065
Brin was Vanessa's roommate?

07:36.166 --> 07:37.967
Yeah. Well, no, not exactly.

07:38.068 --> 07:40.469
Brin couldn't afford a place of her own,

07:40.570 --> 07:43.105
so Vanessa agreed to put her up
for a while.

07:43.206 --> 07:44.306
Brin is Miss September.

07:44.407 --> 07:46.442
From the Tackles calendar. Right.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.767
She's not a suspect, is she?

07:47.944 --> 07:49.078
Do you murder a good friend

07:49.103 --> 07:50.770
just because she kicks you off the sofa?

07:50.947 --> 07:53.215
Or shoot your attorney
who's suing your ex-employer?

07:53.316 --> 07:55.317
<i>Vanessa said she needed to be alone.</i>

07:55.342 --> 07:58.511
Brin was angry that she had
to find someplace else to stay,

07:58.688 --> 07:59.822
but was even more worried

07:59.847 --> 08:02.299
that Vanessa would
try and hurt herself again.

08:02.831 --> 08:04.265
They had known each other before Tackles

08:04.290 --> 08:06.625
from this acting class
that they had taken together.

08:06.930 --> 08:08.330
<i>Vanessa was an actress?</i>

08:08.355 --> 08:10.990
Yeah, can you believe it...
A beautiful young girl

08:11.015 --> 08:13.583
moves to Los Angeles,
seeking her fame and fortune.

08:13.837 --> 08:15.604
Will wonders never cease?
Vanessa worried it would damage

08:15.705 --> 08:17.072
Here she is, Commander.

08:17.174 --> 08:20.075
Vanessa Blaine has one credit,
a TV movie...

08:20.177 --> 08:22.111
"Great White Shark Attack 4."

08:22.212 --> 08:24.613
They had to do number four
because "Shark Attack 3"

08:24.714 --> 08:27.249
left so much of the story up in the air.

08:27.350 --> 08:30.286
Vanessa was an aspiring
Hollywood actress.

08:30.387 --> 08:31.887
And who have we met in this case

08:31.912 --> 08:34.114
who has an interest in starlets?

08:34.291 --> 08:36.457
I don't recognize her
at all, but, you know,

08:36.559 --> 08:38.527
these girls start
to blend together after a while.

08:38.628 --> 08:40.496
Why, what did this
Vanessa girl say about me?

08:40.597 --> 08:42.331
Well, not much these days.

08:42.432 --> 08:44.300
She died yesterday afternoon

08:44.401 --> 08:46.635
after someone used a stun gun
on her several times

08:46.736 --> 08:49.305
while holding a plastic bag
over her head.

08:49.406 --> 08:51.840
I g... I get why Erik Walsh
would kill Bonnie,

08:51.942 --> 08:53.409
but why Vanessa?

08:53.510 --> 08:55.110
You saw how he treated the actress

08:55.212 --> 08:56.612
in that viral video.

08:56.713 --> 08:57.947
He's a monster.

08:58.048 --> 08:59.281
<i>Okay, so?</i>

08:59.382 --> 09:01.183
So, we found your eBay account

09:01.284 --> 09:04.753
- with a list of movie props you sold.
- Yeah, to pay my damn rent.

09:04.854 --> 09:06.956
And you know what we found
on that list, Erik?

09:07.057 --> 09:09.625
Stun guns, just like the ones you used

09:09.726 --> 09:12.628
in your 2011 hit "Sudden Vengeance."

09:12.729 --> 09:15.464
Now, is it possible that you held on

09:15.489 --> 09:18.057
to one of those stun guns,
you know, as a keepsake?

09:18.082 --> 09:20.883
Guys, those stun guns are props, fakes.

09:21.137 --> 09:24.273
I would never let a live weapon
on a set while I was directing.

09:24.374 --> 09:27.376
Safety issues... my safety in particular.

09:27.477 --> 09:29.411
Yeah, well, since you're
in the business of storytelling,

09:29.436 --> 09:31.171
- we should probably check that.
- Look!

09:31.348 --> 09:32.715
I don't know this girl Vanessa.

09:32.816 --> 09:35.417
And you said she died when?
Yesterday afternoon?

09:35.442 --> 09:39.179
Because I was working all day
around maybe 300 people.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.237
Working where?

09:40.490 --> 09:42.725
West Hollywood, off Sunset.

09:42.826 --> 09:44.234
Can we get an address?

09:45.095 --> 09:46.195
Or a cross street?

09:46.296 --> 09:47.696
It's a Starbucks, okay?

09:47.797 --> 09:49.265
I can't afford an office.

09:49.366 --> 09:52.234
So I go there every day,
and I use their Wi-Fi

09:52.335 --> 09:55.337
to send e-mails to producers
and studio executives

09:55.438 --> 09:59.675
begging for one more chance,
even if it's just television.

09:59.776 --> 10:02.044
My barista, Theo, can vouch for me.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.369
He worked a double yesterday.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.463
Well, we'll make sure that
we chat with Theo.

10:06.716 --> 10:08.684
In the meantime, why don't you, uh...

10:08.709 --> 10:10.910
<i>write it all down for us, Erik.</i>

10:11.087 --> 10:12.988
If our former movie director

10:13.013 --> 10:14.480
really was at the office,

10:14.658 --> 10:16.492
then aren't we left with our suspects

10:16.593 --> 10:18.394
from the grand opening of Tackles?

10:18.419 --> 10:20.453
Who each had time to murder Vanessa,

10:20.478 --> 10:22.379
clean up, and head to Hollywood.

10:22.632 --> 10:25.234
Buzz, would you please review your film

10:25.259 --> 10:27.227
from the opening of Tackles last night?

10:27.404 --> 10:28.871
Sure.

10:32.609 --> 10:34.476
Other than a lot of chanting
from the protestors

10:34.577 --> 10:36.412
and a lot of ogling
from guys in the crowd,

10:36.513 --> 10:38.547
the only suspicious thing might be...

10:38.572 --> 10:40.506
these holsters,
which I didn't really notice

10:40.684 --> 10:42.184
- at the time.
- Is that a stun gun?

10:42.285 --> 10:45.721
Yeah, one of the new ones, too.
Doesn't leave a mark.

10:45.822 --> 10:47.456
These security goons at Tackles

10:47.557 --> 10:49.158
work directly for Craig Curtis?

10:49.259 --> 10:51.627
Yes, and they're definitely over 30.

10:51.728 --> 10:53.629
Amy and Cami, I think it's time

10:53.730 --> 10:56.098
to notify Mr. Curtis
about Vanessa Blaine's death

10:56.123 --> 10:59.125
and make sure he brings
a little security with him.

10:59.302 --> 11:00.936
Yes, Commander.

11:09.546 --> 11:11.314
Rusty.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.534
Hey, Andrea. Long time no see.

11:16.711 --> 11:18.345
- Were you expecting him?
- Yeah.

11:18.370 --> 11:19.570
Uh, this will only take a minute.

11:19.671 --> 11:21.739
Good, because you're on the clock.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.674
Excuse me.

11:23.775 --> 11:26.377
Uh, is Andrea pissed at me?

11:26.478 --> 11:29.947
- Well, I told her that we broke up.
- Oh, I...

11:30.048 --> 11:31.315
You told her why, too, I guess?

11:31.416 --> 11:33.217
Does everybody here just hate me now?

11:33.318 --> 11:34.352
No, not everyone.

11:34.453 --> 11:37.855
Look, I have something for you.

11:37.956 --> 11:39.357
This is yours.

11:39.458 --> 11:42.326
Inside is a great reference from Aiden

11:42.427 --> 11:43.761
and two months' severance pay.

11:43.862 --> 11:46.297
It's not as much as you could've
gotten in a lawsuit,

11:46.398 --> 11:48.666
but the recommendation will help
you to get a better job.

11:48.767 --> 11:51.302
And in the event that
a future employer calls,

11:51.403 --> 11:53.404
Aiden has agreed to speak about you

11:53.505 --> 11:54.972
in the most positive way possible.

11:55.073 --> 11:56.207
You went to talk to Aiden?

11:56.308 --> 11:58.075
- About what?
- This.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.810
Gus, I talked to him about this,
obviously.

11:59.912 --> 12:01.112
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

12:01.213 --> 12:04.615
What Aiden did to us was immoral,

12:04.716 --> 12:06.717
but what he did to you was illegal.

12:06.818 --> 12:10.888
No one can be fired for...
for not sleeping with the boss.

12:10.989 --> 12:13.491
And I said leave it alone.
I don't want to get paid for...

12:13.592 --> 12:14.992
Oh, man. This is embarrassing.

12:15.093 --> 12:16.928
Oh, so... so you'd...
you'd rather be struggling

12:17.029 --> 12:19.764
to pay your bills and waiting
tables at a diner, Gus?

12:19.789 --> 12:22.357
No, but I-I feel like I'm being
bought off for... for sex.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.487
- It's gross.
- Gross? Okay, well, just so you know,

12:25.524 --> 12:27.171
- when I <i>was</i> being bought off for sex...
- Rusty, that is not what I meant.

12:27.272 --> 12:29.040
...I never made 10 grand, ever.

12:29.141 --> 12:30.541
So if that's what this check is for,

12:30.566 --> 12:33.301
then that must've been
some spectacular sex, Gus.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.682
Look, if... if you won't
do it for yourself,

12:37.783 --> 12:40.751
do it for the other people
that Aiden treated this way.

12:40.852 --> 12:42.286
Other people? What other people?

12:42.387 --> 12:44.355
Oh, y-you think that you're the only guy

12:44.456 --> 12:45.823
that Aiden ever hired or promoted

12:45.848 --> 12:48.516
for reasons not related
to job performance?

12:49.502 --> 12:53.097
Aiden agreed to give you
the reference and the check

12:53.198 --> 12:54.565
because if you sued him, suddenly,

12:54.666 --> 12:56.634
a lot of other people just like you, Gus,

12:56.735 --> 12:58.402
would start coming forward,
and that would not...

12:58.503 --> 12:59.870
Stop. Just stop!

12:59.972 --> 13:01.055
Stop.

13:02.473 --> 13:03.708
I get it.

13:03.809 --> 13:05.476
I was an idiot.

13:06.812 --> 13:09.680
And the answer you were
looking for before...

13:09.705 --> 13:11.439
was twice.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.784
I slept with Aiden twice.

13:15.687 --> 13:17.722
And t-t-the second time was only because

13:17.823 --> 13:19.657
I... I wasn't sure how to say "no."

13:19.758 --> 13:21.092
Yeah, well, it feels
like you couldn't say "no"

13:21.193 --> 13:23.194
the first time, either.

13:26.665 --> 13:27.865
I hope that recommendation

13:27.966 --> 13:30.034
helps to put your career back on track.

13:32.204 --> 13:34.238
I'm sorry it upset you.

13:34.339 --> 13:36.140
I was never very good at
making you happy.

13:38.176 --> 13:40.878
Anyway, I have to go. Excuse me.

13:46.051 --> 13:47.618
We hit the jackpot.

13:47.719 --> 13:49.754
After my guys cracked Vanessa's
six-digit pin on her phone,

13:49.855 --> 13:51.956
they cloned her disk image
onto this device.

13:52.057 --> 13:53.858
Now we have access to all the victim's

13:53.959 --> 13:55.438
texts, calls, and photos.

13:55.463 --> 13:57.161
When did Vanessa last back up her phone?

13:57.262 --> 13:58.496
Three days before her murder.

13:58.597 --> 13:59.901
Three days?

13:59.926 --> 14:02.833
That means that we won't have
any texts from the killer

14:02.934 --> 14:05.736
saying that he's gonna stop by
Vanessa's house.

14:05.837 --> 14:08.472
Probably not, but we got
a lot of back and forth

14:08.573 --> 14:10.007
between Vanessa and Bonnie Pearl.

14:10.108 --> 14:11.475
Sometimes Vanessa would even

14:11.576 --> 14:13.244
reach out to Bonnie
in the middle of the night.

14:13.345 --> 14:15.379
Vanessa had trouble sleeping.

14:15.556 --> 14:16.957
So she texted her attorney?

14:16.982 --> 14:18.582
Well, Alex Snow said that

14:18.683 --> 14:20.684
out of all the women involved
in the lawsuit

14:20.786 --> 14:22.920
that Vanessa was closest with Bonnie,

14:22.945 --> 14:24.646
even if they argued a little, ma'am.

14:24.823 --> 14:28.192
No, I think that
Bonnie Pearl was more of a...

14:28.293 --> 14:30.795
- maternal figure.
- Exactly.

14:30.820 --> 14:32.821
Every Wednesday morning
for the last two months,

14:32.998 --> 14:34.498
Bonnie would send Vanessa a text

14:34.599 --> 14:36.133
reminding her of her 4:00 appointment.

14:36.234 --> 14:40.137
"Don't forget about 4PM.
You're stronger than you think."

14:40.238 --> 14:42.173
And then a smiley-face emoji.

14:42.274 --> 14:43.808
Wow.

14:44.543 --> 14:46.644
Bonnie Pearl didn't seem
like the emoji type.

14:46.745 --> 14:48.479
"You're stronger than you think."

14:48.580 --> 14:49.747
Was Bonnie talking about

14:49.848 --> 14:51.816
the attempted suicide
or the lawsuit, ma'am?

14:51.917 --> 14:54.518
It's hard to say,
but where was Vanessa going

14:54.619 --> 14:56.487
every Wednesday at 4:00 p.m.?

14:56.588 --> 14:58.789
If her cell's location services was on...

14:58.814 --> 15:00.291
- It was.
- Let's see what <i>that tells us.</i>

15:00.392 --> 15:01.826
Amy, were you able to convince

15:01.927 --> 15:03.828
Craig Curtis to speak with us again?

15:03.929 --> 15:06.363
He's getting a visitor's badge
downstairs with Cami

15:06.465 --> 15:08.532
and a massive security guy he calls Tick.

15:08.633 --> 15:11.702
Tick? I assume Tick is his given name.

15:11.803 --> 15:13.070
Unknown, but he was asked

15:13.171 --> 15:15.506
to surrender his stun gun
before coming upstairs.

15:15.607 --> 15:17.842
I held on to it for... safety reasons.

15:17.943 --> 15:20.911
We can call up morgue photos
and see if this fits the profile

15:21.012 --> 15:23.647
of the weapon used on Vanessa, ma'am.

15:23.824 --> 15:25.325
This is beginning to feel

15:25.350 --> 15:26.851
like <i>déjà vu, Detective Paige.</i>

15:26.952 --> 15:29.086
What am I doing here again?

15:29.187 --> 15:32.256
You know, there are easier ways
to find out if a guy's into you.

15:32.357 --> 15:33.591
Like, do you have a card or something?

15:33.692 --> 15:36.393
- You're not my type.
- Oh, no? Why's that?

15:36.495 --> 15:38.796
You're too far over 30.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.999
And a sense of humor, too.
Ooh, I love it.

15:47.148 --> 15:48.441
Hey.

15:48.466 --> 15:50.774
Oh, sorry, Tick.
You need to wait outside.

15:50.876 --> 15:53.777
But, uh, help yourself
to the break room next door.

15:53.879 --> 15:55.513
<i>You have the right to remain silent...</i>

15:55.614 --> 15:57.481
Commander, this stun gun
has a distance of...

15:57.582 --> 15:59.183
1 1/2 inches between prongs.

15:59.284 --> 16:01.752
That's just like one of the new stun guns

16:01.853 --> 16:03.554
that Morales showed us in the morgue.

16:03.655 --> 16:05.256
We'll need more than matching stun guns

16:05.281 --> 16:06.815
to connect Curtis to Vanessa's murder.

16:06.840 --> 16:10.054
- And Bonnie was shot in the head.
- Curtis could've hired

16:10.079 --> 16:12.302
this oversized dirt bag to off Vanessa.

16:12.631 --> 16:14.198
<i>You mind telling me what this is about?</i>

16:14.299 --> 16:16.300
<i>The Miranda Warning shouldn't
make you feel special.</i>

16:16.401 --> 16:18.135
<i>We have to give it to everyone
who talks to us</i>

16:18.236 --> 16:19.837
<i>- in this building.
- Oh, my God.</i>

16:19.938 --> 16:22.506
You guys lie to people
even when you don't need to.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.241
It centers us.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.119
<i>We have bad news,</i>

16:26.144 --> 16:28.245
<i>and we, um,
wanted to inform you in person.</i>

16:28.422 --> 16:29.756
Really? Bad news? What bad news?

16:29.781 --> 16:31.482
One of your former employees...
Vanessa...

16:31.507 --> 16:33.007
died yesterday afternoon.

16:33.185 --> 16:36.153
We found her after the grand
opening of your new restaurant.

16:36.254 --> 16:38.622
Vanessa's d...

16:38.723 --> 16:40.357
What, was it suicide?

16:40.458 --> 16:43.827
Murdered... asphyxiated in her own home.

16:43.929 --> 16:45.696
Not before the killer used a stun gun

16:45.721 --> 16:47.555
15 times on Vanessa's body.

16:47.580 --> 16:49.381
Guess who we know who has access

16:49.406 --> 16:51.611
to as many stun guns as he wants.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.971
Oh, come o... W-Why would
I do something like that?!

16:54.072 --> 16:56.073
Because Stan Pearl told you
that he would reach

16:56.174 --> 16:57.808
a much better financial arrangement

16:57.909 --> 16:59.376
with Tackles than his mother ever would.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.545
And Vanessa refused to settle,
so let's ask ourselves,

17:01.646 --> 17:03.013
who benefits from both these murders?

17:03.038 --> 17:04.472
Okay, and then let's ask ourselves,

17:04.497 --> 17:06.326
where was I yesterday afternoon?

17:06.351 --> 17:08.085
Oh, that's right. The answer
is here, with you guys.

17:08.109 --> 17:10.411
Yeah, where were you before
that, between 11:00 and 3:00?

17:10.589 --> 17:12.132
I... I was working out in the morning,

17:12.156 --> 17:13.924
and then I was getting ready
for my opening that night,

17:14.025 --> 17:16.060
so I had a two-hour pep talk
with Bill Landon.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.972
Dr. Bill Landon...
one of your top investors?

17:18.997 --> 17:20.297
Yeah, well, he's also my life coach.

17:20.397 --> 17:21.732
And yesterday, I needed a little help

17:21.757 --> 17:23.458
<i>getting pumped up for the red carpet.</i>

17:23.635 --> 17:25.536
I don't know if this is the exact weapon,

17:25.637 --> 17:27.938
but it matches up with
the one that attacked Vanessa.

17:28.039 --> 17:29.740
It's a circumstantial step.

17:29.917 --> 17:31.874
It's still a long way from murder.

17:31.899 --> 17:34.163
We need to confirm your session
<i>with Dr. Landon himself.</i>

17:34.188 --> 17:35.750
<i>Yeah, well, good luck
getting ahold of him.</i>

17:35.775 --> 17:37.508
<i>He's doing a seminar in Salt Lake City.</i>

17:37.609 --> 17:41.185
Commander, I think we found Vanessa
Blaine's weekly appointment.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.775
Every Wednesday afternoon
for the past two months,

17:50.809 --> 17:55.346
Vanessa shows up inside this
circle 12 miles from her house.

17:55.447 --> 17:57.515
Within here, we have a parking structure,

17:57.616 --> 18:00.652
a restaurant, a drug store,
and a medical building.

18:00.753 --> 18:04.589
Four stories of doctor's offices
occupied by two dermatologists,

18:04.614 --> 18:06.848
an ENT specialist,
an internist, a proctologist,

18:07.026 --> 18:10.228
a surgery/outpatient center,
and Dr. Jane Cross,

18:10.253 --> 18:13.655
a psychologist whose website
says she specializes

18:13.680 --> 18:15.748
in the after effects of sexual assault.

18:16.001 --> 18:17.535
Now, we checked with Dr. Cross's office,

18:17.560 --> 18:20.529
and they would not confirm
why Cross was seeing Vanessa.

18:20.706 --> 18:24.542
Ye Gods. She was raped.

18:24.643 --> 18:27.078
Maybe that's why Vanessa tried
to kill herself.

18:27.179 --> 18:29.747
And why she said that
no financial settlement

18:29.772 --> 18:30.839
would ever be enough.

18:31.016 --> 18:32.517
So if we accept this theory,

18:32.618 --> 18:34.852
how does it fit
with our pattern of facts?

18:34.953 --> 18:36.921
Well, it explains why Craig Curtis

18:36.946 --> 18:39.881
let a bunch of other women go
from Tackles all at once...

18:40.135 --> 18:41.502
to cover up what he'd done.

18:41.527 --> 18:42.560
Is there a police report

18:42.661 --> 18:45.229
- of this supposed sexual assault?
- Uh, no.

18:45.330 --> 18:47.832
Vanessa Blaine could've been
raped two years ago.

18:47.933 --> 18:50.101
Curtis can't be arrested on a theory.

18:50.126 --> 18:52.594
We just can't let this asshole
walk out of here.

18:52.847 --> 18:54.248
What other choice do we have?

18:54.273 --> 18:57.408
Craig Curtis might have raped
and murdered Vanessa,

18:57.509 --> 19:00.211
but all we can prove
is that he fired her.

19:00.236 --> 19:02.738
Which, in itself,
is not an arrestable offense.

19:02.763 --> 19:04.897
But what we can do, starting now,

19:04.922 --> 19:08.158
is protect everyone else
involved in this lawsuit,

19:08.366 --> 19:10.100
including Vanessa's psychologist,

19:10.125 --> 19:14.570
who may very well know
the name of our rapist.

19:17.428 --> 19:18.828
You sure I can't help?

19:18.929 --> 19:21.468
Not that you need any lessons.

19:21.569 --> 19:24.337
All you need to do is relax.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.043
Why aren't you going to that
new specialist until Friday?

19:30.068 --> 19:32.736
Because my symptoms
have already gone away,

19:32.837 --> 19:34.471
and it is less urgent...

19:34.572 --> 19:38.208
...than the dead body I have
in the morgue.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.262
What's going on there?

19:40.287 --> 19:43.656
Uh, well, uh, the prep is done.

19:43.681 --> 19:46.750
Now the lasagna just needs to bake.

19:46.851 --> 19:48.719
No, I mean your phone keeps ringing.

19:48.744 --> 19:51.612
You keep declining. Is it Gus?

19:53.358 --> 19:55.058
You must be psychic.

19:55.159 --> 19:56.393
Yeah.

19:56.494 --> 19:58.995
I won my first settlement conference...

19:59.097 --> 20:00.430
a severance pay

20:00.531 --> 20:02.833
and a letter of recommendation
for Gus from Aiden.

20:02.934 --> 20:04.401
And don't worry, I wasn't playing lawyer.

20:04.502 --> 20:05.902
Just bluffing like crazy

20:06.003 --> 20:09.806
while Aiden took a moment
to... consider his past.

20:09.907 --> 20:12.442
So Gus isn't the first person
he's done this to?

20:12.543 --> 20:13.677
Well, what are the odds?

20:13.778 --> 20:16.079
Anyway, after considering his options,

20:16.180 --> 20:18.181
Aiden signed a fantastic

20:18.282 --> 20:20.384
letter of recommendation, written by me,

20:20.485 --> 20:21.852
and two months' severance.

20:21.953 --> 20:24.888
When I gave it all to Gus,
he got mad at me.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.691
I'm sure that Gus will come around.

20:27.792 --> 20:29.086
Who cares?

20:29.594 --> 20:31.862
Um... look what came in the mail.

20:43.341 --> 20:44.975
Your college diploma.

20:45.076 --> 20:48.745
Your college diploma. Oh, my God, Rusty.

20:48.846 --> 20:51.515
You did this in three years.

20:51.616 --> 20:55.485
I am so proud of you.

20:55.586 --> 20:57.554
I never could have done it
without you, Mom.

20:57.655 --> 20:59.256
Hey, what's going on?

21:01.392 --> 21:02.826
Look.

21:04.996 --> 21:07.030
Oh, wow.

21:07.131 --> 21:08.331
Congratulations, kid.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.000
Thanks, Andy.

21:12.136 --> 21:13.403
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah.

21:13.504 --> 21:16.239
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I am incredibly okay.

21:16.340 --> 21:17.908
I'm, uh...

21:18.009 --> 21:19.910
I'm so happy.

21:20.011 --> 21:22.579
This is everything that I wanted for you.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.047
It's everything I dreamed about.

21:24.148 --> 21:26.116
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

21:26.217 --> 21:28.318
Don't apologize, Mom. I...

21:28.419 --> 21:29.686
I almost cried myself there, so...

21:29.787 --> 21:33.190
Hey, there's a lot going on.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.958
Now if we could just keep you safe...

21:35.059 --> 21:36.560
We'll keep him safe.

21:36.661 --> 21:38.895
As safe as a future attorney can be.

21:38.996 --> 21:40.664
Oh, my son, the lawyer.

21:40.765 --> 21:43.333
After three more years of work.

21:43.434 --> 21:45.535
Oh. Oh!

21:47.798 --> 21:49.963
Oh, my gosh.

21:53.711 --> 22:00.083
You know, I've never felt
this challenged and...

22:00.184 --> 22:03.086
this is the happiest I've...

22:04.390 --> 22:07.290
I've ever been in my entire life.

22:07.315 --> 22:08.442
I have...

22:09.360 --> 22:13.296
I have three children through college

22:13.397 --> 22:17.200
and a perfect husband.

22:17.301 --> 22:21.905
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

22:22.006 --> 22:23.840
Oh, Rusty.

22:25.995 --> 22:28.187
You guys just totally screwed me.

22:28.212 --> 22:30.113
Some of the girls are dropping
out of the lawsuit

22:30.214 --> 22:34.217
because you told them
they could be raped and killed?

22:34.318 --> 22:37.153
Are you deliberately trying
to destroy my whole case?

22:37.255 --> 22:41.391
We are already investigating
two murders related to Tackles.

22:41.492 --> 22:43.894
These young women need to be warned.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.806
Why the hell didn't you tell <i>me</i> Vanessa,

22:46.831 --> 22:49.666
my client for God's sake,
had be murdered?!

22:49.843 --> 22:51.711
Why didn't you tell us that Vanessa

22:51.736 --> 22:53.386
was the victim of a sexual assault?

22:53.487 --> 22:55.472
Because I didn't know until you started

22:55.497 --> 22:57.398
asking all these girls about it!

22:57.575 --> 22:58.875
Your mom knew.

22:58.976 --> 23:01.144
She was encouraging Vanessa
to get support.

23:01.245 --> 23:03.480
Well, Mom kept things from me.

23:03.581 --> 23:06.349
Always too busy jetting off
to God knows where

23:06.374 --> 23:08.409
to interview some nobody waitress.

23:08.662 --> 23:10.997
<i>Any girl let go from Tackles</i>

23:11.022 --> 23:13.300
- Any girl?
- These women were over 30.

23:13.325 --> 23:15.191
- His mother didn't teach him very well.
<i>- Wasn't enough to call</i>

23:15.293 --> 23:17.961
<i>and ask if they'd like
to be included in the case.</i>

23:18.062 --> 23:19.996
No, she had to look them in the eye.

23:20.021 --> 23:23.157
Stan, it is possible that Vanessa's rape

23:23.410 --> 23:24.967
caused her murder.

23:24.992 --> 23:27.103
That's why it is so important

23:27.128 --> 23:30.998
that we read all of Bonnie's
notes regarding Tackles.

23:31.175 --> 23:33.810
<i>You guys honestly think
I'm gonna help you?</i>

23:33.911 --> 23:37.061
<i>A-After the way I've been treated?</i>

23:37.086 --> 23:38.481
Buzz?

23:38.659 --> 23:40.059
<i>- I have news reporters following...
- Julio, the commander</i>

23:40.084 --> 23:41.418
wants us to turn up the heat a little.

23:41.519 --> 23:43.386
...asking me if I offed my mother!

23:43.487 --> 23:45.455
Oh, maybe they're on
to something, Stanley.

23:45.556 --> 23:46.890
Where were you before the protest

23:46.991 --> 23:48.792
at the Hollywood Tackles opening?

23:48.893 --> 23:51.528
- I'm sorry?
- At your office? At lunch?

23:51.629 --> 23:53.229
Murdering Vanessa at her house? Where?

23:53.331 --> 23:55.966
<i>Murdering Vanessa, what?!
Why would I do that?!</i>

23:56.067 --> 23:58.868
Because Vanessa would
not come to terms with Craig,

23:58.893 --> 24:01.160
and Craig was not gonna pay anyone out

24:01.339 --> 24:03.640
until everyone agreed not to sue.

24:03.817 --> 24:06.352
Your mother even had a nickname
for her...

24:06.377 --> 24:08.011
"Burbank/Dallas SA."

24:08.112 --> 24:11.081
SA as in... settlement agreement?

24:11.182 --> 24:13.350
Vanessa blocked your big pay day.

24:13.527 --> 24:14.894
She was never going to settle

24:14.919 --> 24:16.586
after being fired and then raped.

24:16.763 --> 24:19.031
You hid that from us
until you could kill her!

24:19.056 --> 24:21.691
<i>That's bullshit, and you know it!</i>

24:21.792 --> 24:24.461
I-I'm not a murderer or a rapist, either!

24:24.562 --> 24:26.949
Me, a rapist?

24:27.565 --> 24:28.832
<i>What happens to your civil case...</i>

24:28.933 --> 24:30.400
- Commander?
- Yes?

24:30.501 --> 24:31.668
Dr. Cross, the psychologist

24:31.769 --> 24:33.203
who was treating Vanessa, is downstairs.

24:33.304 --> 24:34.492
Want me to go get her?

24:34.517 --> 24:37.307
Yes, please, Wes. Bring her to my office.

24:37.408 --> 24:40.210
<i>in an illegible form of chicken scratch.</i>

24:40.311 --> 24:41.978
<i>I'll go to the firm and get them,</i>

24:42.079 --> 24:43.546
- but what I find...
- No, no, no, no, no.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.015
You're not leaving our sight.

24:45.116 --> 24:47.984
Have your mother's notes
brought over here.

24:49.930 --> 24:51.921
Well, I need a phone.

24:52.023 --> 24:53.490
Please?

24:53.591 --> 24:57.427
God. It's so annoying.

24:57.528 --> 25:00.096
Why didn't Mom tell me about the rape?

25:00.273 --> 25:02.074
Vanessa didn't want anyone to know,

25:02.099 --> 25:04.434
and she had to be convinced
to come see me.

25:04.535 --> 25:06.569
Over the years, Bonnie used me to help

25:06.594 --> 25:10.129
with lots of sexual assault
cases from her practice.

25:10.307 --> 25:11.908
Bonnie...

25:14.078 --> 25:17.047
Bonnie was a great voice for women,

25:17.072 --> 25:20.040
and silencing her like this is a tragedy.

25:20.217 --> 25:21.451
It is.

25:21.552 --> 25:23.153
It really is.

25:23.330 --> 25:24.630
So, ordinarily,

25:24.655 --> 25:27.157
everything Vanessa told you
would be privileged,

25:27.334 --> 25:28.934
but since her murder...

25:28.959 --> 25:32.228
It's horrible. Horrible, horrible.

25:32.329 --> 25:35.413
If Vanessa opened up to you
during her recovery process,

25:35.438 --> 25:37.658
especially if she said anything
about her attacker,

25:37.683 --> 25:39.506
<i>that could be extremely helpful.</i>

25:39.537 --> 25:41.404
Though not necessarily admissible.

25:41.505 --> 25:44.908
You have to understand, the
attack was not very long ago,

25:45.009 --> 25:48.011
<i>and she was in my support
group, not one-on-one therapy.</i>

25:48.112 --> 25:50.113
Some women need time

25:50.214 --> 25:52.248
<i>to fully absorb what happened,</i>

25:52.349 --> 25:54.918
<i>especially when they knew their attacker</i>

25:55.019 --> 25:57.353
and feel that they're somehow
<i>partly to blame.</i>

25:57.455 --> 25:59.089
So she knew her rapist by name?

25:59.190 --> 26:02.258
Yes, but she never identified him.

26:02.359 --> 26:03.993
Though she did finally agree

26:04.095 --> 26:06.329
to describe the details of her assault.

26:06.430 --> 26:07.841
Which were?

26:08.466 --> 26:11.034
She accepted an invitation from this man

26:11.059 --> 26:14.028
to join him in his hotel room
for a glass of wine,

26:14.205 --> 26:15.572
to watch the sunset.

26:15.673 --> 26:17.874
To her, it was
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

26:17.975 --> 26:19.976
When you say "spur of the moment,"

26:20.077 --> 26:21.911
did they just run into
each other by accident,

26:22.088 --> 26:23.989
or was this someone
she knew from Tackles,

26:24.014 --> 26:26.416
like a... a customer or a supervisor?

26:26.517 --> 26:28.084
All she said about her rapist

26:28.185 --> 26:30.386
was that this was a guy that she trusted,

26:30.488 --> 26:33.508
and there was no hint
of sexual advance beforehand.

26:33.533 --> 26:35.333
So Vanessa went up to his room...

26:35.358 --> 26:37.427
And before she finished
her glass of wine,

26:37.528 --> 26:39.562
she started to feel woozy.

26:39.663 --> 26:40.930
She was drugged?

26:41.031 --> 26:42.632
She didn't lose consciousness,

26:42.733 --> 26:45.001
but she had to lie down.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.303
That's when he tied her up to the bed.

26:47.899 --> 26:48.814
God.

26:48.839 --> 26:52.175
He gagged her with a hand towel
and kept saying...

26:52.276 --> 26:55.245
"Trust me" over and over

26:55.681 --> 26:57.714
until he was done.

27:00.217 --> 27:01.818
And then what?

27:01.919 --> 27:04.120
Then he ordered her a taxi.

27:05.524 --> 27:07.590
And they say chivalry is dead.

27:07.691 --> 27:09.526
What is it, Buzz?

27:09.627 --> 27:10.994
Bonnie Pearl's assistants are here

27:11.095 --> 27:13.296
with her notes and files...
two mail carts full.

27:13.397 --> 27:16.232
- I've heard enough.
- Yeah, me too. I'll help.

27:17.668 --> 27:19.235
<i>Did Vanessa confide any of this</i>

27:19.336 --> 27:22.057
<i>to her friends after the fact
or call the police?</i>

27:22.082 --> 27:23.215
<i>No.</i>

27:23.240 --> 27:26.212
She thought because she worked
as a Tackles model,

27:26.240 --> 27:28.642
the police would
think she was asking for it.

27:28.743 --> 27:30.010
I tried to convince her

27:30.111 --> 27:32.479
that a work wardrobe
never legitimizes rape,

27:32.580 --> 27:36.350
but like so many women
who suffer sexual assault,

27:36.451 --> 27:38.452
she internalized the trauma.

27:38.553 --> 27:42.155
So she didn't identify the guy,
but what about a description?

27:42.256 --> 27:44.524
Height, weight, race, hair color?

27:44.625 --> 27:45.592
No.

27:45.693 --> 27:46.727
The name of the hotel?

27:46.828 --> 27:48.095
I'm sorry.

27:48.196 --> 27:50.931
All I can say for sure
is that he was no stranger.

27:51.032 --> 27:53.800
As for what Bonnie knew, <i>I have no idea.</i>

27:53.901 --> 27:55.068
And we won't know, either,

27:55.169 --> 27:56.570
because Bonnie was shot in the face.

27:56.671 --> 27:59.940
Unless Bonnie, the lawyer,
wrote it all down somewhere.

28:00.041 --> 28:01.742
He tied Vanessa up.

28:01.843 --> 28:05.445
- He had rope with him in his hotel room.
- And drugs.

28:05.546 --> 28:08.248
Doesn't sound spontaneous to me.

28:08.349 --> 28:10.784
<i>Well, we don't know the name
of our rapist,</i>

28:10.885 --> 28:14.388
but he did give us
one identifying feature.

28:14.413 --> 28:16.080
And that would be?

28:16.491 --> 28:19.192
He is definitely not a beginner.

28:31.092 --> 28:33.526
I guess your phone is broken?

28:36.664 --> 28:39.432
I didn't answer your zillion
texts and calls

28:39.457 --> 28:41.258
because I'm mad and I was at work.

28:41.435 --> 28:43.603
Well, I just want to say
I-I'm sorry and thank you,

28:43.704 --> 28:46.406
and... and it's all clear now
what happened.

28:46.507 --> 28:48.541
And t-the recommendation
and the money will help,

28:48.642 --> 28:51.544
- a-and you didn't have to do all that.
- No, I did, Gus!

28:51.645 --> 28:53.580
Aiden destroyed my relationship,

28:53.681 --> 28:56.383
which was incredibly important to me.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.160
He backed me into a corner...

28:58.185 --> 28:59.719
He didn't back you into a corner.

28:59.820 --> 29:02.322
He fully explained to you
why he was taking me to Napa.

29:02.423 --> 29:04.024
Oh, what, he said that to you?

29:04.049 --> 29:05.352
When he fired me.

29:06.527 --> 29:08.294
He said that you'd come by
to pick me up at work

29:08.319 --> 29:10.119
and that he'd dare you to tell me

29:10.297 --> 29:12.514
that the promotion was
only because he wanted to...

29:12.539 --> 29:13.735
you know...

29:15.503 --> 29:17.504
You just let me go knowing that?

29:17.529 --> 29:18.429
No, Gus...

29:18.454 --> 29:20.255
Without even, like, a heads up?

29:20.508 --> 29:22.842
If I were that important to you...

29:22.943 --> 29:25.211
- Was it, like, some kind of test?
- No, no, it wasn't a test.

29:25.236 --> 29:27.104
You were just... You were so...

29:27.129 --> 29:28.830
excited about Napa.

29:28.855 --> 29:30.823
And I... And yes, I-I behaved badly

29:30.848 --> 29:32.048
when you told me about the promotion.

29:32.073 --> 29:34.274
I just... I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

29:34.755 --> 29:37.023
And this is better? Nothing?

29:37.048 --> 29:37.860
Nothing is better

29:37.885 --> 29:39.207
- than hurting my feeling?
- No. Gus...

29:39.360 --> 29:40.693
- Now we have nothing!
- Look, here's the problem.

29:40.795 --> 29:43.797
The Gus that I knew... I love that guy.

29:43.822 --> 29:45.055
And... And...

29:45.080 --> 29:46.848
You look like him and you sound like him,

29:46.873 --> 29:48.407
but you are not him,

29:48.736 --> 29:50.772
because the guy that I knew that...

29:51.760 --> 29:52.587
Rusty...

29:52.612 --> 29:54.920
The guy that... the guy
that I <i>thought</i> I knew

29:54.945 --> 29:57.154
never would have hurt me like this.

29:58.813 --> 30:01.366
Rusty, I am that guy that you knew.

30:03.017 --> 30:04.620
And I love you, too.

30:06.114 --> 30:08.332
I promise, you can trust me,
but please...

30:10.258 --> 30:13.629
please... let's just try and fix this.

30:18.333 --> 30:20.267
Was Aiden the first time
you slept with someone else,

30:20.292 --> 30:22.888
or was it just the first time
you decided to tell me?

30:24.185 --> 30:26.933
How do I know that there aren't
10 more Aidens out there?

30:27.909 --> 30:28.976
Or 20?

30:32.564 --> 30:33.881
Oh, my God.

30:33.906 --> 30:36.608
See, I don't know how to trust you again.

30:36.633 --> 30:38.801
And here is...
here is the whole truth, Gus.

30:38.826 --> 30:42.395
If I could... I would forgive you.

30:44.759 --> 30:46.828
I just don't know how.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.472
I can't say this is
the start of a pattern,

30:58.573 --> 31:00.474
but back when he was playing
football in college,

31:00.575 --> 31:03.210
a cheerleader named Natalie Reed
accused Curtis

31:03.311 --> 31:05.880
and four of his fellow teammates
of gang rape.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.338
So our famous restaurateur

31:07.515 --> 31:10.050
also has experience in sexual assault.

31:10.075 --> 31:11.442
Natalie claimed the players

31:11.620 --> 31:13.787
slipped her some sort of drug
before the attack.

31:13.889 --> 31:16.123
Then how come we never heard of
this previous rape before?

31:16.148 --> 31:18.516
Uh, because it wasn't prosecuted, sir,

31:18.693 --> 31:20.127
and it was kept out of the press.

31:20.152 --> 31:21.486
Curtis was about to win the Heisman.

31:21.663 --> 31:24.498
Which would make him not only an MVP,

31:24.599 --> 31:27.201
but, perhaps, a very famous alumnus,

31:27.226 --> 31:29.627
meaning millions of dollars
in future donations.

31:29.804 --> 31:32.406
I talked to the old defensive
coordinator for Craig's team

31:32.507 --> 31:35.976
who had... trouble with the way
things went down back then.

31:36.001 --> 31:37.302
And, according to Natalie's mom,

31:37.479 --> 31:39.179
who's still crying about it, by the way,

31:39.357 --> 31:40.690
her daughter ended up taking

31:40.715 --> 31:42.983
an $80,000 settlement from the school.

31:43.084 --> 31:45.719
To keep her from reporting
the assault to the police.

31:45.744 --> 31:46.878
And buy her silence,

31:46.903 --> 31:48.403
and it worked, too... for a while.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.357
Until Natalie jumped off the center

31:50.382 --> 31:52.650
of Tampa's Skyway Bridge
three years later.

31:52.903 --> 31:54.070
And, unlike Vanessa's,

31:54.095 --> 31:56.163
this suicide attempt was a success.

31:56.264 --> 31:58.032
She did leave a note, though,

31:58.057 --> 32:00.658
accusing Craig Curtis
and his friends of rape.

32:00.683 --> 32:02.184
Her mother e-mailed us this.

32:02.316 --> 32:05.318
Curtis is good for these murders. He is.

32:05.540 --> 32:06.674
But can we prove it?

32:06.775 --> 32:09.009
Well, we may not have the exact stun gun

32:09.110 --> 32:10.978
or the weapon that murdered Bonnie,

32:11.079 --> 32:12.513
but her files will help.

32:12.614 --> 32:15.549
Bonnie had discovery requests
from fired waitresses

32:15.650 --> 32:17.584
from all of Craig Curtis's restaurants.

32:17.609 --> 32:20.377
And it turns out that Stan Pearl
was telling the truth.

32:20.555 --> 32:22.122
Bonnie Pearl traveled quite a bit

32:22.147 --> 32:23.548
over the last couple of months,

32:23.725 --> 32:26.026
visiting various cities
with Tackles restaurants.

32:26.127 --> 32:28.662
Yes, but was that
for her Tackles lawsuit,

32:28.763 --> 32:32.099
or was she trying to find out
who raped Vanessa Blaine?

32:32.200 --> 32:34.034
Curtis was notified of her murder.

32:34.135 --> 32:35.602
Maybe we should see how he reacts

32:35.704 --> 32:37.438
to hearing about her sexual assault.

32:37.463 --> 32:38.529
Oh, I agree.

32:38.707 --> 32:41.275
But we may get more
of an unguarded response

32:41.376 --> 32:46.080
if we surprise Mr. Curtis
in his natural habitat.

32:53.121 --> 32:55.723
Aww. Hey, cutie. Welcome back to Tackles.

32:55.748 --> 32:57.215
Uh, hello, ma'am.

32:57.392 --> 33:00.094
"Ma'am"? So formal. I like it.

33:00.195 --> 33:01.462
You officers want the bar or a table?

33:01.563 --> 33:03.897
We are so not hungry. Is Craig Curtis in?

33:03.999 --> 33:06.200
Oh, uh, Craig doesn't like
to talk to people when he's...

33:06.225 --> 33:08.426
We're L.A.P.D. We don't care
if he wants to talk with us.

33:08.603 --> 33:10.437
We want to talk with him. Understand?

33:10.538 --> 33:12.172
Wow, okay.

33:12.273 --> 33:14.742
No need to be rude.

33:17.612 --> 33:19.313
You guys know about Vanessa's rape?

33:19.414 --> 33:20.714
That's... That's a surprise, actually.

33:20.815 --> 33:22.516
Oh, are we not supposed
to know about that?

33:22.617 --> 33:25.252
Like we weren't supposed to know
about Natalie Reed?

33:25.353 --> 33:26.520
Oh, come on. That...

33:26.621 --> 33:28.055
You have any idea how long ago that was?

33:28.156 --> 33:29.323
Yes, and in case you were wondering

33:29.424 --> 33:30.958
about Natalie, she's still dead.

33:31.059 --> 33:32.993
You mention Natalie Reed again,
this conversation is over.

33:33.018 --> 33:35.153
You want to talk about Vanessa, fine.

33:35.330 --> 33:37.431
Yeah, she called me
right after it happened.

33:37.456 --> 33:39.157
She was... Well, she was drugged.

33:39.182 --> 33:40.282
She was scared out of her mind.

33:40.535 --> 33:42.036
Why would she contact you?

33:42.061 --> 33:43.194
Because I just told you, she was scared.

33:43.371 --> 33:44.605
She wanted me to protect her.

33:44.630 --> 33:46.097
You know that taking care of these girls

33:46.274 --> 33:47.274
is a serious part of my job.

33:47.299 --> 33:48.399
Until they turn 30.

33:48.652 --> 33:49.853
When'd you get this call from Vanessa?

33:49.878 --> 33:51.979
- Can you put a date to it?
- Yeah.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.580
Was part of taking care of Vanessa

33:53.681 --> 33:55.482
- firing her a month later?
- Her contract expired.

33:55.583 --> 33:56.950
I couldn't make an exception for her

33:56.975 --> 33:58.208
without causing a bigger headache.

33:58.233 --> 34:00.268
- Who raped her?
- You know, she wouldn't say.

34:00.522 --> 34:02.456
Probably because she knew
I would do something to the guy.

34:02.557 --> 34:05.692
Here. It was, uh, the 19th, 11:27 p.m.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.594
I'm sitting on the tarmac,
flying back from Vegas,

34:07.695 --> 34:09.396
she calls me, she's crying so hard,

34:09.420 --> 34:11.041
- I could barely understand her.
- Mm, is that what you said

34:11.065 --> 34:12.766
after you and your friends
gang-raped Natalie?

34:12.867 --> 34:14.089
All right, you know,
shut your mouth, bitch!

34:14.114 --> 34:15.771
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

34:15.795 --> 34:16.818
- Sit down right now.
- No, no, no, no, no.

34:16.848 --> 34:18.768
It's okay, Wes.
Let the big man hit the girl.

34:18.793 --> 34:19.746
Go for it, asshole.

34:19.772 --> 34:21.260
You're gonna talk to me
like that in my place, huh?

34:21.284 --> 34:23.625
For the last time, sit down.

34:28.750 --> 34:30.083
Hey, what the hell's going on?

34:30.109 --> 34:31.418
Drop your weapon!

34:31.518 --> 34:33.253
You sit your ass down.

34:37.058 --> 34:40.260
Back up. Back it up.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.529
I never raped anyone in my life!

34:42.630 --> 34:43.840
And I didn't kill Vanessa, either.

34:43.864 --> 34:45.399
You know, I do have an alibi
for that day.

34:45.424 --> 34:46.958
Ask Bill Landon. He'll back me up.

34:47.135 --> 34:49.402
Mm, your friend Dr. Landon's a
little hard to get on the phone.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.705
Yeah, maybe you could help us find him.

34:52.574 --> 34:54.308
I'm sorry it's taken me a while
to get back to you.

34:54.409 --> 34:55.909
I was holding a seminar in Salt Lake,

34:56.010 --> 34:57.744
then a full-day retreat in Santa Barbara,

34:57.846 --> 34:59.480
and now we're off to
one of Vicky's charity galas.

34:59.657 --> 35:00.857
We fight for animal rights

35:00.882 --> 35:02.483
because they can't fight for themselves.

35:02.584 --> 35:04.318
She'll be feeding us to a pack
of rescue dogs

35:04.419 --> 35:06.453
if we're not done in five minutes.

35:07.589 --> 35:10.424
We understand your time
is precious, Dr. Landon.

35:10.525 --> 35:11.992
Oh, everyone's time is
precious, Commander.

35:12.093 --> 35:13.894
It's one of the things we teach
in the Landon Method.

35:13.995 --> 35:16.330
Do you have somewhere my wife
and son can wait while we chat?

35:16.355 --> 35:17.655
Oh, right through here.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.014
Dad, don't over-explain.

35:19.267 --> 35:21.568
- We need to wrap this up in two minutes.
- I heard five.

35:21.669 --> 35:23.871
Seth is right.
This is not a workshop, Bill.

35:23.972 --> 35:26.573
Sorry.

35:26.598 --> 35:27.532
Oh!

35:27.709 --> 35:30.043
See, Seth, uh, manages my schedule.

35:30.145 --> 35:32.212
And then Vicky makes sure that
any attempts at being profound

35:32.313 --> 35:34.148
only occur in front of a paying audience.

35:34.249 --> 35:35.782
It's wonderful, though, don't you think?

35:35.807 --> 35:36.873
Working with your family?

35:37.051 --> 35:39.620
Oh, yeah, mostly.
But, uh, this is one detail

35:39.645 --> 35:41.779
in which they can both remain uninvolved.

35:41.956 --> 35:44.625
So, you'd like to know
if Craig was really with me

35:44.726 --> 35:47.060
on the afternoon the young woman
from Tackles was murdered?

35:47.085 --> 35:48.585
Yeah, that would be helpful.

35:48.763 --> 35:50.264
Well, short answer is "yes."

35:50.365 --> 35:52.399
I had a roughly two-hour talk with Craig,

35:52.424 --> 35:54.492
helping him release expectations.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.806
Let me explain. See...

35:58.640 --> 36:00.974
when Craig first came to me,
he was depressed,

36:01.075 --> 36:03.777
suffering from an injury
that not only ended his career,

36:03.802 --> 36:06.104
but destroyed the life
he'd planned to live.

36:06.281 --> 36:08.815
Oh, and this guy planned, practiced,

36:08.917 --> 36:11.518
sacrificed for a dream
he'd cherished from childhood.

36:11.619 --> 36:14.655
And this incredibly human ability

36:14.756 --> 36:18.525
to see beyond the curve,
like, to look ahead of today,

36:18.626 --> 36:20.694
well, that can morph from
one of our greatest strength

36:20.719 --> 36:23.888
into a debilitating weakness, and why?

36:24.065 --> 36:26.400
Well, because very often,
we arrive at the future,

36:26.425 --> 36:29.627
only to discover that, uh,
it just isn't there.

36:29.880 --> 36:31.514
That instead, we've entered a space

36:31.539 --> 36:34.341
where no amount of planning,
no sacrifice,

36:34.442 --> 36:37.544
no hope will manifest our expectations.

36:37.645 --> 36:42.849
And in this situation,
we must adapt, adapt, adapt,

36:42.951 --> 36:45.852
and find another way to love our lives.

36:45.954 --> 36:48.455
There is no goal greater than this.

36:48.556 --> 36:50.624
Love your life right now.

36:51.026 --> 36:54.528
Which just happens to be
the name of my new book.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.656
I'm gonna leave a copy with you.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.433
"Love Your Life Right Now."

36:59.610 --> 37:02.278
Available next week on Amazon
and in bookstores.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.638
So, after he lost his football career,

37:04.663 --> 37:06.631
you helped Craig love his life

37:06.884 --> 37:08.885
by opening a tits-and-ass restaurant?

37:08.910 --> 37:10.410
I don't create dreams, Detective.

37:10.511 --> 37:11.878
I just turn them into reality.

37:11.903 --> 37:13.937
You know, you'd be surprised
how often people let

37:14.115 --> 37:18.218
unidentified, misdirected anger,
resentment,

37:18.243 --> 37:20.578
and, yes, fear ruin their lives.

37:20.603 --> 37:23.338
What did Craig have to be afraid
of, if he's so innocent?

37:23.591 --> 37:25.425
Well, fear of the lawsuit, of course,

37:25.526 --> 37:26.860
fear of failure,

37:26.961 --> 37:28.462
fear of the harsh judgment of others.

37:28.487 --> 37:29.687
Harsh judgment? From what?

37:29.864 --> 37:31.498
Letting young women go from a job

37:31.599 --> 37:33.033
just 'cause they hit 30, that's, uh...

37:33.134 --> 37:34.534
it's right on Craig's brand,

37:34.636 --> 37:37.437
but from a human standpoint,
it's hardly endearing.

37:37.538 --> 37:38.839
Bill!

37:38.940 --> 37:41.408
Are you talking alibis or the Method?

37:41.509 --> 37:43.944
Those Galápagos penguins
aren't gonna save themselves.

37:44.045 --> 37:45.646
And part of loving <i>my</i> life

37:45.747 --> 37:47.214
is keeping my spouse happy right now.

37:47.315 --> 37:48.882
So anything else?

37:48.907 --> 37:49.907
Doctor, when's your next

37:50.084 --> 37:51.785
intensive seminar in Los Angeles?

37:51.886 --> 37:54.154
Later this week.
You can register on our website.

37:54.255 --> 37:56.690
<i>And</i> feel free to pass
those around if you want to.

37:56.791 --> 37:59.693
We'll call you if we have
any more questions, sir.

37:59.794 --> 38:00.927
Lieutenant?

38:01.029 --> 38:03.864
Questions such as
the long-term effects of guilt.

38:03.965 --> 38:06.433
- Oh, I could talk about guilt for hours.
- Oh, no, no.

38:06.534 --> 38:09.236
Well, I specialize a bit in guilt myself.

38:09.337 --> 38:10.470
Oh, right through here.

38:10.571 --> 38:11.738
Are you really gonna pay good money

38:11.839 --> 38:13.273
to hear this guy talk all day?

38:13.374 --> 38:16.576
No, I just want to make sure
he'll be around if we need him.

38:17.070 --> 38:18.979
We found something. Buzz?

38:19.080 --> 38:21.581
I'm working on it. I'm working on it.

38:21.683 --> 38:23.684
- See?
- Thank you. Okay.

38:23.709 --> 38:26.577
This is a map of
all 15 Tackles locations.

38:26.754 --> 38:28.689
Now, the receipts that Buzz and I found

38:28.790 --> 38:30.657
confirm that over the past two months,

38:30.758 --> 38:34.328
Bonnie traveled to every single
one of these cities.

38:34.353 --> 38:35.786
Looking through Bonnie's files,

38:35.811 --> 38:39.514
we didn't find any actual names
of women she spoke to,

38:39.767 --> 38:42.969
but we did discover
three more double cities

38:42.994 --> 38:45.762
with the initials "S.A."
scribbled by them.

38:45.787 --> 38:49.356
As in "Burbank/Dallas SA,"
a.k.a. Vanessa Blaine.

38:49.610 --> 38:52.179
Yes, ma'am, but no real
phone numbers or names.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.514
But there is a San Diego/Miami SA,

38:54.615 --> 38:58.585
an Indianapolis/Tampa SA,
and a Las Vegas/Atlanta SA.

38:58.686 --> 39:01.355
"S.A." doesn't stand
for "settlement agreement."

39:01.456 --> 39:03.023
It stands for "sexual assault."

39:03.124 --> 39:05.225
That would explain
why Bonnie didn't write down

39:05.326 --> 39:07.828
Vanessa's name or phone number
in her call logs, too.

39:07.929 --> 39:10.664
She wanted to keep
the sexual assault quiet

39:10.765 --> 39:12.999
until she'd found other victims.

39:13.101 --> 39:15.869
Because Vanessa's rapist was,

39:15.970 --> 39:18.638
- obviously, very experienced.
- Oh, my God.

39:18.740 --> 39:20.140
Bonnie and Vanessa <i>weren't</i> killed

39:20.241 --> 39:22.642
because they were
suing Craig Curtis for damages.

39:22.744 --> 39:23.944
No, they were murdered

39:23.969 --> 39:26.837
to conceal a pattern of sexual assault.

39:27.014 --> 39:29.149
And we need to identify
all these other women

39:29.174 --> 39:32.009
before they end up dead, too.

39:44.211 --> 39:45.311
Are you feeling light-headed again?

39:45.412 --> 39:46.645
No, I'm fine. It's just...

39:46.746 --> 39:49.415
I-It's just what? Y-You can tell me.

39:49.516 --> 39:52.985
I-I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

39:53.010 --> 39:55.445
And I know it's a lot to ask...

39:55.622 --> 39:57.323
But if anything were to happen...

39:57.424 --> 39:59.058
Sharon, nothing is gonna happen.

39:59.083 --> 40:02.485
No, I know. But I-I need to say this.

40:02.662 --> 40:05.264
If anything were to happen, please,

40:05.365 --> 40:08.734
please look after my children.

40:08.759 --> 40:10.293
Of course.

40:10.470 --> 40:13.072
But y-you're gonna be here.

40:13.173 --> 40:17.776
But if I'm not, if something bad
were to happen...

40:17.801 --> 40:19.435
Look, remember,

40:19.613 --> 40:22.615
my own ticker isn't what it used to be.

40:27.654 --> 40:30.322
We'll be... two injured hearts

40:30.347 --> 40:31.781
- beating as one.
- Oh, God.

40:31.806 --> 40:35.309
That sounds like a...
a bad country-western song.

40:35.562 --> 40:38.297
Look, the kids will be fine. I promise.

40:38.322 --> 40:40.256
How did I get so lucky?

40:40.281 --> 40:42.616
I think because
you finally gave in, really.

40:46.106 --> 40:47.387
What?

40:48.909 --> 40:50.609
I've been so happy in my life,

40:50.634 --> 40:53.236
but walking through that door to see

40:53.261 --> 40:56.229
yet another doctor
could change everything.

40:57.217 --> 40:58.951
Not everything.

41:01.070 --> 41:02.902
Never everything.

41:04.524 --> 41:05.824
Okay.
