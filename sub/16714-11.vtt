Help me...

00:20.133 --> 00:21.297
Aah!

00:21.367 --> 00:23.859
Capricorn? Really? Me, too.

00:23.969 --> 00:26.789
Let me buy you a drink.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.117
I think he really likes you.

00:31.165 --> 00:33.133
What's the matter
with you, Kevin?

00:33.211 --> 00:34.586
I almost had a heart attack.

00:34.664 --> 00:35.914
Yeah, not much of a pickup line,

00:35.961 --> 00:38.888
but then again, he is a corpse.

00:38.975 --> 00:41.633
Seriously, you can be
such a jerk.

00:41.704 --> 00:43.781
Just relax.
I was just trying to...

00:43.875 --> 00:46.874
- Grayson's coming.
- Come, help! Help me here.

00:51.961 --> 00:53.195
Everything all right in here?

00:53.299 --> 00:55.805
Yes, ma'am. I thought
I'd come in early to prep.

00:56.125 --> 00:57.711
Save you some time.

00:57.859 --> 01:01.398
Mr. hilliard, have you ever
heard of Eddie haskell?

01:01.636 --> 01:02.711
No, ma'am.

01:02.851 --> 01:05.180
I think you might be
a direct descendant.

01:05.272 --> 01:06.297
Well, thank you, ma'am.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.226
Mm-hmm.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.109
Let's get started.

01:11.422 --> 01:12.750
Oh!

01:13.258 --> 01:14.437
Are you ok?

01:14.492 --> 01:16.926
Yes. It's just...

01:17.398 --> 01:20.117
I never worked
on a real person before.

01:20.226 --> 01:22.992
Cadavers aren't people, Ms.
Flanagan, they're things.

01:23.093 --> 01:26.305
Slabs of flesh we briefly
inhabit, like motel rooms.

01:26.360 --> 01:29.483
You check in, you stay a
while, you check out.

01:33.883 --> 01:36.719
Well, that's a weird place
for a tattoo.

01:42.898 --> 01:45.305
This is Joan Grayson with the
county coroner's office.

01:45.430 --> 01:48.633
I need to speak with
detective trejo in homicide.

01:48.843 --> 01:50.812
Right now.

01:53.383 --> 01:56.289
Hey! Welcome back.

01:56.479 --> 01:57.617
Hi. Mmm!

01:57.713 --> 01:59.578
I missed you so much.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.859
You must be Walker.

02:00.914 --> 02:02.109
Great to finally meet you.

02:02.157 --> 02:03.173
It's really great
to finally meet you.

02:03.220 --> 02:04.376
I've heard nothing
but wonderful things.

02:04.423 --> 02:06.066
Uh, ok, speaking
of wonderful things,

02:06.127 --> 02:07.307
let's have it.
How's your mom doing?

02:07.354 --> 02:09.561
She's ok. You know, we have
good days and bad days.

02:09.609 --> 02:10.991
So, are you still going
to be going to Houston

02:11.038 --> 02:12.047
on the weekends to visit her?

02:12.094 --> 02:13.430
No, actually, I...

02:13.508 --> 02:15.500
Excuse me.

02:16.180 --> 02:18.062
Dr. Reid here.

02:18.476 --> 02:19.911
What?

02:20.062 --> 02:21.234
All right, stay there.
I'll be right...

02:21.281 --> 02:23.291
I'm on my way, ok? Thanks.

02:23.533 --> 02:24.649
Sorry, guys, I have to go.

02:24.697 --> 02:25.838
Everything all right?

02:25.892 --> 02:27.798
A water pipe broke
at my apartment.

02:27.846 --> 02:30.588
Tell prentiss
I'll call her when I can.

02:31.283 --> 02:32.309
What was that all about?

02:32.361 --> 02:35.080
Reid apparently has
a plumbing emergency at home.

02:35.150 --> 02:36.602
Oh, no, what a pain.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.031
We'll need to bring him
up to speed later.

02:38.078 --> 02:39.757
Right now we have a case.

02:42.109 --> 02:45.193
Last night, in tampa,
this semi sort of doodle

02:45.241 --> 02:47.929
was discovered on the arm
of a cadaver

02:47.977 --> 02:50.484
that was being dissected
in an anatomy class.

02:50.531 --> 02:52.147
What is it, some kind of tattoo?

02:52.195 --> 02:53.756
No, it's an ink pen drawing.

02:53.804 --> 02:55.648
Yeah, and luckily
for law enforcement,

02:55.696 --> 02:57.054
the teacher of the anatomy class

02:57.103 --> 02:59.640
is also the county coroner,
and she recognized the marking.

02:59.719 --> 03:01.937
She'd also seen it on...

03:02.108 --> 03:03.218
Helen Bollinger.

03:03.269 --> 03:05.866
Helen was found dead
in her car 10 days earlier

03:05.914 --> 03:07.718
with 50 sleeping pills in her system

03:07.788 --> 03:08.904
and it was ruled a suicide.

03:08.952 --> 03:10.249
With that scribbled on her arm?

03:10.297 --> 03:12.413
Please tell me there was an
equivocal death investigation.

03:12.430 --> 03:14.687
There was, but the m.E.
Determined that the evidence

03:14.749 --> 03:16.773
didn't meet the threshold
to rule it a homicide.

03:16.842 --> 03:18.193
The marking on the second body

03:18.257 --> 03:20.169
has an extra line added to it.

03:20.241 --> 03:21.874
The design could be
a work in progress.

03:22.070 --> 03:23.734
Do we have an identity
on the cadaver?

03:23.792 --> 03:26.929
Yes. George Findley. He's a Gulf war vet.

03:26.992 --> 03:28.218
He lived on the street for years.

03:28.265 --> 03:29.968
He died of a heroin overdose.

03:30.132 --> 03:33.195
Marking looks like
and initial, an "a", maybe.

03:33.273 --> 03:35.507
It could also be a partial triangle.

03:35.623 --> 03:37.781
Or the Unsub's got a brand all his own

03:37.828 --> 03:39.186
and he's sending a message...

03:39.234 --> 03:40.383
"These victims belong to me."

03:40.430 --> 03:42.218
If it's a message, why place it

03:42.266 --> 03:44.609
on such an obscure part of the body?

03:44.686 --> 03:47.756
A sophisticated staging like
this takes time and practice.

03:47.804 --> 03:49.445
This Unsub's killed before.

03:49.532 --> 03:51.108
Which means we need
to move fast.

03:51.156 --> 03:54.109
Reid can meet us later in Florida.
Wheels up in 10.

04:03.366 --> 04:05.507
Don't worry,
I'm never coming back!

04:05.616 --> 04:06.757
Whoa, what are you doing?

04:06.805 --> 04:07.756
Leaving.

04:07.804 --> 04:09.522
You can't leave.
We have an agreement.

04:09.570 --> 04:10.873
You-you signed a contract.

04:10.921 --> 04:11.961
The contract didn't say anything

04:12.008 --> 04:14.296
about a crazy person
threatening my life.

04:14.374 --> 04:17.015
She did this
on purpose. Goodbye.

04:18.584 --> 04:19.678
Is she gone?

04:19.726 --> 04:21.291
Mom, what did you say to her?

04:21.390 --> 04:23.210
She was trying to get
information from me.

04:23.288 --> 04:24.661
Kept asking questions!

04:24.709 --> 04:26.242
Of course she was. She's supposed to.

04:26.296 --> 04:28.477
I told you to be careful about the
people you bring into this house.

04:28.524 --> 04:30.180
There are spies everywhere!

04:30.227 --> 04:32.912
She's not a spy.
She was here to help you.

04:32.960 --> 04:36.866
Shh! She might
still be out there... listening.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.210
Don't ever let her come
back in here again, please.

04:39.257 --> 04:40.054
Promise me.

04:40.102 --> 04:41.070
I will promise you that,

04:41.140 --> 04:42.889
because she is never
coming back!

04:42.937 --> 04:44.148
She walked out!

04:44.234 --> 04:45.279
Good.

04:45.645 --> 04:47.802
Because we can only
trust each other now.

04:48.364 --> 04:51.356
Nobody else. Just you and me.

05:43.101 --> 05:45.645
Ok. Bye.

05:46.906 --> 05:48.029
So?

05:48.094 --> 05:50.100
Short version...
Spence took his mom

05:50.147 --> 05:52.222
out of the clinical study
study in Houston early

05:52.277 --> 05:53.300
and brought her home with him.

05:53.347 --> 05:54.409
Did he say why?

05:54.456 --> 05:57.253
Evidently the experimental
medicine isn't working.

05:57.394 --> 05:59.614
Which facility is he
putting her in up here?

05:59.662 --> 06:02.309
He isn't. He said that
he is bringing his mom

06:02.371 --> 06:03.566
to stay with him.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.081
At his apartment?

06:05.238 --> 06:07.089
The instinct is admirable,

06:07.144 --> 06:08.541
but does Reid have any idea

06:08.588 --> 06:09.972
how difficult that's gonna be?

06:10.020 --> 06:11.231
Well, if he didn't before,

06:11.308 --> 06:13.105
he is gonna get
a crash course now.

06:13.158 --> 06:15.572
This morning his mom got
into a fight with the new caretaker,

06:15.636 --> 06:18.011
then she left the bathroom
faucet running,

06:18.097 --> 06:20.199
flooded the apartment,
the caretaker quit,

06:20.331 --> 06:22.502
but Spence still
wants to be patched in

06:22.550 --> 06:24.300
for the video conferencing now.

06:24.412 --> 06:26.801
Garcia's standing by.

06:29.488 --> 06:31.300
Be careful not to slip.

06:31.423 --> 06:33.574
I have to jump on
a conference call for work.

06:33.636 --> 06:34.761
Are you gonna be ok
for a few minutes?

06:34.808 --> 06:37.011
Spencer, I'm sorry.
This is a mess.

06:37.128 --> 06:39.394
It's ok. I know
it was an accident.

06:45.214 --> 06:48.027
Your books are ruined.

06:48.441 --> 06:49.941
Just a few of them. It's ok.

06:50.003 --> 06:51.792
No, it's not.

06:52.339 --> 06:54.848
Destroying a book is like...

06:55.355 --> 06:58.218
Destroying a whole world.

07:01.308 --> 07:03.260
You want to maybe lie down
for a little while

07:03.308 --> 07:05.013
and get some rest?

07:05.277 --> 07:07.460
Yes, that's a good idea, honey.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.464
I need rest.

07:17.246 --> 07:20.714
Hey-o. Beaming Reid
into the starship bau.

07:21.308 --> 07:24.081
Hey, there's my favorite
genius. Welcome back.

07:24.135 --> 07:26.972
It's good to be back. I'm
sorry about all this trouble.

07:27.042 --> 07:28.659
No, don't be silly.
And if there's anything

07:28.706 --> 07:30.574
we can do to help,
just let us know.

07:30.636 --> 07:32.620
Thank you. I had a chance to
look over the case files.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.988
Do we know anything new about
the two victims in Tampa?

07:35.097 --> 07:37.666
Only about how little there is to learn,

07:37.714 --> 07:39.355
and Garcia can't find any connection

07:39.417 --> 07:41.300
between Helen Bollinger
and George Findley.

07:41.363 --> 07:42.722
Which isn't that surprising.

07:42.770 --> 07:45.399
Homeless vet, upper-middle-class
suburban mom.

07:45.446 --> 07:46.932
Not much overlap there.

07:46.988 --> 07:48.511
What about their personal lives?

07:48.574 --> 07:50.502
Well, George was homeless,

07:50.550 --> 07:52.940
so his personal life
was sort of problematic.

07:52.987 --> 07:54.799
Helen, on the other hand,
ticks every box

07:54.847 --> 07:56.448
on the wholesome
soccer mom checklist.

07:56.496 --> 07:59.096
President of her PTA,
super active at Church,

07:59.144 --> 08:00.658
heavily involved in charity work.

08:00.706 --> 08:02.566
Spence, have you looked
at the ink markings yet?

08:02.613 --> 08:03.996
I did. Whatever it is,

08:04.020 --> 08:05.534
it doesn't come from
traditional sources

08:05.581 --> 08:07.299
of art, mythology,
and literature.

08:07.347 --> 08:09.440
Except for the incomplete
base of a triangle,

08:09.488 --> 08:12.004
the design is evocative of
the pagan symbol for earth.

08:12.051 --> 08:14.261
Garcia, look into other
questionable suicides

08:14.308 --> 08:16.785
and accidental deaths
in the Tampa area recently.

08:16.863 --> 08:18.899
Searching that.
On it.

08:18.946 --> 08:21.680
Rossi, when we land, you and
Lewis check in with the M.E.

08:21.727 --> 08:24.383
Alvez, see what you can find
out about George Findley.

08:24.430 --> 08:26.807
Jj, Helen Bollinger's husband
is coming in.

08:26.854 --> 08:29.132
I'd like you to talk to him to see if
he can fill in some of the blanks.

08:29.179 --> 08:32.191
Walker and I will set up
with the local P.D.

08:34.389 --> 08:37.123
I knew it. Helen would
never have killed herself.

08:37.171 --> 08:41.304
Can you tell me about
the day she died?

08:41.663 --> 08:44.343
It was a... it was a day
like any other day.

08:44.507 --> 08:48.963
You know, she got up, headed
off to her pilates class.

08:49.296 --> 08:53.107
Um, our daughter crystal had a ballet
recital at school that evening.

08:53.155 --> 08:54.747
I was just gonna meet
her there after work.

08:54.794 --> 08:56.085
And how old is crystal?

08:56.139 --> 08:57.702
9.

08:57.755 --> 09:00.684
And you're certain she didn't
take those sleeping pills

09:00.749 --> 09:02.210
with her when she left?

09:02.272 --> 09:04.491
Positive!

09:05.296 --> 09:07.218
Honestly, I forgot
she even had them.

09:07.335 --> 09:08.649
Ok.

09:08.696 --> 09:10.218
And the mark on her arm?

09:10.296 --> 09:11.772
Was not there when she left.

09:11.834 --> 09:13.725
I told the police that.

09:13.819 --> 09:17.636
Whoever killed her
must have put it there.

09:18.038 --> 09:22.474
Mr. Bollinger, has your house
been burglarized recently?

09:22.827 --> 09:24.733
No. Why?

09:25.468 --> 09:28.491
Has anyone new
had access to your home?

09:28.546 --> 09:30.835
A repairman, a delivery person,

09:30.897 --> 09:32.163
that kind of thing?

09:32.260 --> 09:33.975
Nobody.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.617
Wait.

09:40.671 --> 09:42.328
Two nights before Helen died,

09:42.376 --> 09:44.382
we came back from
a dinner party,

09:44.541 --> 09:46.150
and our babysitter said

09:46.679 --> 09:48.921
she thought she heard
a noise upstairs.

09:49.343 --> 09:50.655
Did you investigate?

09:50.741 --> 09:52.335
Yeah, I checked the whole house.

09:52.499 --> 09:55.608
Nothing was out of
place, nothing stolen.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.711
Helen and I, we didn't
give it another thought.

10:01.429 --> 10:03.470
Oh, my god.

10:03.999 --> 10:05.973
Could that have been him?

10:06.382 --> 10:09.521
I understand you teach anatomy
class every Tuesday evening?

10:09.600 --> 10:10.978
Every other Tuesday.

10:11.179 --> 10:13.858
Just pure luck this body
was sent over that night.

10:13.921 --> 10:15.928
Otherwise nobody'd be the wiser.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.405
You were involved in the
equivocal death investigation

10:19.460 --> 10:21.046
- of Helen Bollinger?
- Mm-hmm

10:21.131 --> 10:22.647
I was the one
who raised a red flag

10:22.695 --> 10:24.554
to begin with
when I saw the arm.

10:24.747 --> 10:26.428
Her husband didn't
recognize the marking,

10:26.476 --> 10:29.296
and he said she hadn't expressed
any suicidal ideation.

10:29.366 --> 10:32.311
And yet you still
determined it was a suicide,

10:32.389 --> 10:35.869
even after foreign DNA was
recovered inside the vehicle?

10:36.335 --> 10:38.186
When the threshold
for homicide isn't met,

10:38.252 --> 10:39.733
I have to go with
what I'm left with.

10:39.866 --> 10:41.271
There was no evidence indicating

10:41.319 --> 10:43.499
Helen had been forced
to consume the pills.

10:43.616 --> 10:45.913
Did you compare ink samples
from both victims?

10:45.960 --> 10:48.302
Yes, and they matched.
Not just the ink,

10:48.350 --> 10:50.210
but the writing
instrument as well.

10:50.264 --> 10:53.170
Every pen develops unique
characteristics with use.

10:53.218 --> 10:55.936
Like ballistics matching
bullets with guns.

10:56.046 --> 10:59.493
Exactly. Unfortunately, in this
case it was a felt-tip pen

10:59.539 --> 11:01.968
you could buy at any office
supply store anywhere.

11:02.147 --> 11:05.144
Were you able to collect
DNA from around the ink area?

11:05.191 --> 11:07.468
Yes, sir. It's being analyzed.

11:07.929 --> 11:09.803
This is a heroin overdose?

11:10.202 --> 11:11.616
I'm not seeing
any needle tracks.

11:11.686 --> 11:13.405
There aren't any.
Except for the one

11:13.468 --> 11:14.621
that killed him, of course.

11:14.678 --> 11:16.745
Findley wasn't a chronic
I.V. Drug user.

11:16.922 --> 11:19.138
Something else I discovered
before you arrived.

11:19.186 --> 11:21.034
Take a look?

11:24.698 --> 11:25.852
What am I looking at?

11:25.900 --> 11:27.299
Microscopic burnt hairs

11:27.346 --> 11:29.742
found on George Findley's torso.

11:30.416 --> 11:31.603
From what?

11:31.773 --> 11:34.834
Since there were no burn
or scorch marks on the victim,

11:34.905 --> 11:37.676
I'm assuming
they came from the killer.

12:23.419 --> 12:26.082
Hey. How'd you sleep?

12:26.203 --> 12:29.804
I'm... ok, I guess.

12:29.953 --> 12:33.365
Look what arrived
while you were sleeping.

12:35.883 --> 12:37.224
What is that?

12:37.311 --> 12:39.193
It's your old scrapbook.

12:39.373 --> 12:43.149
I had uncle Gordon send it
from las Vegas. Look.

12:43.603 --> 12:44.768
What's it for?

12:44.839 --> 12:46.781
It's a scrapbook, mom. You
started this one in high school.

12:46.828 --> 12:48.362
See?

12:48.795 --> 12:49.795
Hmm.

12:49.863 --> 12:53.838
Put pictures and things in it
that you want to keep forever.

12:53.987 --> 12:57.339
I thought it might help
bring back some nice memories.

12:59.299 --> 13:00.833
It's time to take your medicine.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.801
No. No. It tastes terrible.

13:02.858 --> 13:03.923
What if it's poison?

13:03.971 --> 13:04.898
Mom, it's not poison.
Remember when

13:04.946 --> 13:06.225
you first started
taking it in Texas?

13:06.272 --> 13:08.397
It helped. You felt so good
that we were able to go

13:08.445 --> 13:10.533
on that trip to San Antonio.

13:10.604 --> 13:11.892
It's not poison.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.037
Just wait right here.

13:50.849 --> 13:54.346
I put it in some orange juice
so it wouldn't taste so bad.

13:58.356 --> 14:00.352
Mom, come on.

14:03.321 --> 14:05.041
Are you going to
stand there and watch me?

14:05.089 --> 14:06.453
Yes.

14:19.542 --> 14:21.028
Ahh.

14:21.075 --> 14:22.107
You don't have to do that.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.597
Of course I do.

14:23.747 --> 14:25.736
I have to do whatever you want.

14:32.682 --> 14:35.586
So the babysitter probably wasn't
just hearing things that night,

14:35.634 --> 14:37.426
the Unsub broke into the house.

14:37.492 --> 14:40.743
And stole the sleeping pills
he later forced Helen to take.

14:40.807 --> 14:42.818
The police report says
a stuffed animal was found

14:42.866 --> 14:44.587
in the front of Helen's car
when she died.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.966
Yeah. It belonged
to their daughter crystal.

14:47.014 --> 14:51.496
And the police just assumed it
was left from an earlier trip.

14:51.605 --> 14:55.480
Maybe the Unsub stole
more than pills that night.

14:55.564 --> 14:57.881
He took something
he knew he could use later

14:57.944 --> 15:00.423
to coerce Helen into
swallowing the pills.

15:00.523 --> 15:03.637
Do it, or I will
harm your little girl.

15:03.711 --> 15:08.242
And here's exhibit "A"
to show I'm not bluffing.

15:08.673 --> 15:11.571
Hey, what say the mean
streets of Tampa?

15:11.644 --> 15:14.639
The streets might be mean,
but George Findley wasn't.

15:14.695 --> 15:16.514
Everybody I talked to
loved the guy.

15:16.578 --> 15:17.865
No drug issues.

15:17.913 --> 15:19.099
No, just the opposite.

15:19.147 --> 15:22.317
He was a street liaison
for a Drug Rehab Center

15:22.365 --> 15:24.902
that focused on substance
abuse among the homeless.

15:24.980 --> 15:28.126
So he and Helen Bollinger
did have something in common.

15:28.268 --> 15:31.577
They were both held in especially
high esteem by their peers.

15:31.624 --> 15:33.512
One thing was kind of strange.

15:33.645 --> 15:37.963
Findley's body was found
10 miles outside of town

15:38.048 --> 15:39.944
in an abandoned construction site,

15:40.008 --> 15:42.636
nowhere near any of
his usual haunts.

15:42.743 --> 15:44.520
Lab results
on the heroin syringe.

15:44.567 --> 15:47.024
George Findley's prints
and DNA were found on it

15:47.072 --> 15:48.275
and nobody else's.

15:48.567 --> 15:51.138
He shot himself up with heroin?

15:51.186 --> 15:52.466
That makes no sense.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.810
Unless it was under duress,

15:55.001 --> 15:56.578
like Helen with the pills.

15:56.699 --> 15:59.738
So for some reason, it's
critical to our Unsub's ritual

15:59.785 --> 16:02.523
that his victims
die by their own hand.

16:02.736 --> 16:05.476
We need to figure out why.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.821
No! No!

16:08.034 --> 16:09.859
Owen, please don't!

16:09.973 --> 16:11.415
Please, don't.

16:11.463 --> 16:14.589
Owen, please don't.
Don't. Don't do it.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.520
I love you, Beth.

16:17.045 --> 16:19.275
I will always love you.

16:21.716 --> 16:23.562
No!

16:31.911 --> 16:36.283
No! Owen, please!

16:36.432 --> 16:40.312
Please, no! No!

16:40.359 --> 16:42.269
Owen!

16:42.316 --> 16:43.316
Please, Owen!

16:43.428 --> 16:44.449
Please, Owen!

16:55.174 --> 16:57.972
Owen Sims. Officer
said he's the husband

16:58.085 --> 17:00.381
of the female Vic at the house.

17:02.297 --> 17:04.352
Let's see what we have.

17:04.635 --> 17:05.842
Yep.

17:05.888 --> 17:07.222
Well, that's definitely
the work of our Unsub,

17:07.269 --> 17:10.317
but why draw the symbol
on Owen and not on the wife?

17:10.502 --> 17:12.625
Owen must have been
the principal target.

17:12.724 --> 17:14.339
His wife was collateral damage.

17:14.387 --> 17:17.654
Plus, he went to the trouble to
drag him all the way out here.

17:18.320 --> 17:21.880
Gunshot wound to the head,
pointblank range, large caliber.

17:21.986 --> 17:24.351
Probably the .44 Magnum
we found in the living room.

17:24.479 --> 17:26.090
But the female's wound
was smaller.

17:26.191 --> 17:28.137
9-millimeter, maybe.

17:28.265 --> 17:30.537
Two guns. I mean, that's a
big step up in violence

17:30.608 --> 17:32.377
from sleeping pills
and a syringe.

17:32.433 --> 17:33.750
Well, maybe our killer's
getting closer

17:33.797 --> 17:36.581
to the true source of his rage.

17:36.830 --> 17:39.337
So why, why does the Unsub

17:39.429 --> 17:43.825
move Owen from
the house to this spot?

17:43.872 --> 17:45.626
I don't know.

17:46.343 --> 17:50.465
Maybe our killer sees
something out here we don't.

17:57.039 --> 17:58.895
All right, mom, I just
want you to meet her, ok?

17:58.942 --> 18:00.997
Just meet her and tell me
what you think.

18:01.044 --> 18:02.477
I already know what I think.

18:02.524 --> 18:04.712
Come on, mom, let's go.
Let's go say hi.

18:04.759 --> 18:06.669
Mom...

18:08.216 --> 18:10.291
Mother.

18:15.937 --> 18:17.897
Maybe you can show her
your scrapbook, huh?

18:18.020 --> 18:19.062
What for?

18:26.251 --> 18:27.906
- Miss Campbell?
- Dr. Reid.

18:27.954 --> 18:29.325
Yes. Thank you so much for coming

18:29.373 --> 18:30.572
on such short notice.
Thanks. Oh, come in.

18:30.619 --> 18:32.017
No problem.

18:32.770 --> 18:33.829
My goodness.

18:33.877 --> 18:35.277
You must be quite a reader.

18:35.325 --> 18:36.187
Yeah, yeah, I am.

18:36.235 --> 18:37.528
And I'm so sorry about the mess.

18:37.576 --> 18:40.163
We had a, uh, we had a
little bit of an accident.

18:40.273 --> 18:42.461
Come, meet my mom.

18:44.836 --> 18:48.089
Mom, this is Miss Campbell
from the Agency.

18:48.137 --> 18:50.525
Miss Campbell, this is
my mother Diana Reid.

18:50.572 --> 18:53.294
Very nice to meet you, ma'am.

18:55.932 --> 18:57.838
Mom.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.990
Mom. Just say hi to her.
All you...

19:01.037 --> 19:02.270
Mother, you are
behaving like a...

19:02.317 --> 19:03.449
Mom, come out...

19:03.497 --> 19:06.396
It's all right.
Let it go. Let it go.

19:06.443 --> 19:08.621
I'm so sorry. She's not...
She's been really upset,

19:08.669 --> 19:09.921
but I know if I talk to her...

19:09.969 --> 19:11.234
This happens a lot.

19:11.281 --> 19:14.149
Come and sit and tell me
more about your mother.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.885
All right. Thank you.

19:22.511 --> 19:25.415
Only Owen Sims' prints
were on the .44 Magnum.

19:25.462 --> 19:27.016
And the positioning
and trajectory

19:27.063 --> 19:29.452
of the entry wound to the temple
is consistent with suicide.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.914
So he forced Owen
to kill himself,

19:30.962 --> 19:32.059
just like the others.

19:32.107 --> 19:34.145
A photo of his children
was found on the floor

19:34.222 --> 19:35.247
near the wife's body.

19:35.303 --> 19:36.503
What do you know about Owen?

19:36.617 --> 19:38.854
Superintendent of schools
in Clearwater.

19:38.939 --> 19:41.042
Co-workers couldn't say
enough good things about him.

19:41.089 --> 19:42.607
And his wife Beth?

19:42.655 --> 19:44.586
Oh, sketchier history.

19:44.706 --> 19:45.989
Drugs and alcohol issues.

19:46.046 --> 19:49.739
Even did jail time for a dui
hit-and-run a few years back.

19:49.832 --> 19:52.512
But she cleaned up her act.
Her life was back on track.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.997
So these could all be finalists
for citizen of the year,

19:55.045 --> 19:56.112
except for Beth.

19:56.159 --> 19:59.060
And all the victims were
marked with the ink drawing,

19:59.107 --> 20:01.075
except for Beth.

20:01.437 --> 20:05.287
Another small line was added
to the marking on Sims' body.

20:05.379 --> 20:07.879
It's like with each new victim,

20:07.971 --> 20:10.322
he connects a new dot.

20:12.865 --> 20:13.957
What do you got, Garcia?

20:14.004 --> 20:15.471
Hey, hey, remember
how I told you

20:15.507 --> 20:17.874
that Helen Bollinger
was big-time into charity work?

20:17.922 --> 20:21.785
Turns out she worked a lot
at a soup kitchen downtown

20:21.856 --> 20:23.930
that George Findley
was known to frequent.

20:23.980 --> 20:26.544
Did Owen or Beth Sims
do any volunteering there?

20:26.622 --> 20:30.294
No. But Owen ran an annual
Thanksgiving canned food drive

20:30.344 --> 20:31.410
in his school district.

20:31.457 --> 20:32.966
He was a real hands-on
kind of guy.

20:33.014 --> 20:36.792
Turns out he would personally
deliver the donated food

20:36.842 --> 20:38.690
to various shelters
in the Tampa Bay area.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.019
We may have just found
our Unsub's hunting ground.

20:41.066 --> 20:43.675
Garcia, make a list of anyone
who either volunteered

20:43.772 --> 20:46.380
or worked in a salaried capacity
at tampa homeless shelters.

20:46.436 --> 20:48.236
We need to make sure
everyone's accounted for.

20:48.342 --> 20:50.331
On it.

20:51.714 --> 20:53.028
That's when I made the decision

20:53.076 --> 20:55.367
to bring her back
to Washington with me.

20:55.414 --> 20:59.143
It's a very difficult thing you're
attempting to do, Dr. Reid.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.183
The Anderson Clinic is one of the
best facilities in the world.

21:02.274 --> 21:05.230
Yes, I know. In terms of conventional
treatment, I entirely agree.

21:05.336 --> 21:08.293
And that's why I sent her to
Houston in the first place,

21:08.341 --> 21:10.537
but there's a vast amount
of literature and research

21:10.585 --> 21:11.914
on the workings
of the human brain,

21:11.961 --> 21:14.577
and we have not even begun
to scratch the surface.

21:14.726 --> 21:17.931
Personally, I-I believe that great
breakthroughs, especially in medicine,

21:17.979 --> 21:19.522
often come from thinking
outside the box, which...

21:19.569 --> 21:22.706
Yes, but the box is there
for a reason, Dr. Reid.

21:22.753 --> 21:25.931
I mean, safety, quality of life,

21:25.978 --> 21:27.432
controlled environment.

21:27.479 --> 21:28.679
Your mother needs that.

21:28.726 --> 21:30.569
My strong recommendation

21:30.616 --> 21:34.273
is that you put her
in an assisted care facility.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.762
- I'm not gonna do that.
- You're not gonna do that.

21:37.215 --> 21:38.410
I'm not.

21:38.644 --> 21:40.445
Well...

21:41.400 --> 21:42.875
That being the case,

21:42.977 --> 21:44.995
I'd be happy to help you
with your mother.

21:45.042 --> 21:47.185
Y-you... are you serious?

21:47.232 --> 21:49.388
Oh, my gosh, thank you!
You've no...

21:49.435 --> 21:50.622
I'm so sorry. Sorry.
Thank you.

21:50.669 --> 21:52.235
You've no idea how much
this means to me.

21:52.282 --> 21:54.090
I won't be able to start
until tomorrow.

21:54.151 --> 21:54.970
I understand.

21:55.018 --> 21:56.696
But in the meantime,
I'll hire someone

21:56.744 --> 21:58.730
who can cover the night
shifts when you're traveling.

21:58.777 --> 22:00.644
Oh, that would be
so perfect. Thank you.

22:00.691 --> 22:02.401
Now, one more thing.

22:02.448 --> 22:06.029
I need to see the medications
she's currently taking.

22:06.838 --> 22:07.898
Yeah, ok.

22:07.946 --> 22:09.374
Of course, yeah.

22:09.421 --> 22:12.489
It's something we monitor
carefully for obvious reasons.

22:12.536 --> 22:15.092
Of course.

22:24.118 --> 22:27.328
Haloperidol, Doxepin,

22:27.499 --> 22:28.649
galantamine.

22:28.728 --> 22:30.247
Fairly standard
for the treatment

22:30.318 --> 22:31.966
of Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's.

22:32.019 --> 22:34.408
She's not taking anything else?

22:35.212 --> 22:36.483
No.

22:36.618 --> 22:38.469
Ok, then.

22:38.517 --> 22:40.688
I'll work out the details
of the contract

22:40.745 --> 22:42.762
and send it over later tonight.

22:43.024 --> 22:45.112
You have a nice day,
Dr. Reid.

22:45.247 --> 22:46.890
You, too.
Thank you so much.

22:46.952 --> 22:48.692
You're welcome.

22:52.931 --> 22:54.297
There must be some sort of logic

22:54.344 --> 22:57.456
as to how this Unsub
chooses his disposal sites,

22:57.503 --> 22:59.958
because it's certainly
not convenience.

23:00.005 --> 23:03.640
Notice in every location the
earth is damaged in some way.

23:03.687 --> 23:04.941
Damaged how?

23:04.988 --> 23:07.065
Dug up.
Gone to seed.

23:07.112 --> 23:10.046
Findley was left at this
abandoned construction site.

23:10.093 --> 23:12.938
Owen was dragged
to this ratty little area,

23:12.985 --> 23:15.185
and Helen Bollinger's car was
parked at the edge of a landfill.

23:15.232 --> 23:16.141
You're right.

23:16.188 --> 23:18.410
He could have gone
to less risky areas

23:18.457 --> 23:21.446
if all he was doing was disposing
of them outside the city.

23:21.493 --> 23:23.448
I'm going to go back
to these locations,

23:23.495 --> 23:24.461
take a closer look.

23:24.508 --> 23:25.862
Do you see something?

23:25.909 --> 23:28.320
Yeah. Look at
the demarcation line

23:28.367 --> 23:30.901
of the earth here, where the
damaged terrain begins.

23:30.948 --> 23:32.958
Yeah, what is that?

23:33.005 --> 23:34.871
I've got a pretty good hunch.

23:34.946 --> 23:38.037
Back in an hour.

23:38.577 --> 23:39.644
Huh.

23:39.692 --> 23:41.511
I wonder what Reid's doing.

23:41.794 --> 23:44.281
I know. He's been
on my mind, too.

23:44.699 --> 23:46.082
Ironic, isn't it?

23:46.404 --> 23:47.590
What?

23:48.215 --> 23:53.094
How eventually we become
parents to our parents.

23:55.807 --> 23:58.826
Must be time for the profile.

23:59.064 --> 24:00.931
The person we're looking
for is targeting victims

24:00.978 --> 24:02.165
of high moral character,

24:02.212 --> 24:04.301
manipulating them
into killing themselves,

24:04.348 --> 24:07.025
marking them, and then
disposing of the bodies

24:07.072 --> 24:08.405
in secondary locations.

24:08.452 --> 24:10.562
All the victims
crossed in some way

24:10.609 --> 24:12.802
with the homeless community
here in tampa.

24:12.850 --> 24:14.744
The killer may be
homeless himself

24:14.791 --> 24:17.903
or possibly connected to the
charitable outreach community.

24:17.950 --> 24:19.638
We believe this person
is a loner.

24:19.685 --> 24:21.151
Evidence found on the victims

24:21.198 --> 24:24.254
indicates he may himself
be a burn victim.

24:30.026 --> 24:31.750
The killer left substantial DNA

24:31.797 --> 24:33.864
and other trace evidence
at two of the crime scenes.

24:33.911 --> 24:37.289
This indicates either he's
sloppy, he's not in the system,

24:37.336 --> 24:38.568
or he just doesn't care.

24:38.615 --> 24:41.126
The last possibility
is the most concerning.

24:41.173 --> 24:43.773
It means he's resigned himself
to being caught eventually

24:43.820 --> 24:45.897
and already has
an end game in mind.

24:45.944 --> 24:47.844
The secondary disposal
sites are located in areas

24:47.891 --> 24:51.870
where the surrounding landscape
has been disturbed in some way.

24:51.917 --> 24:53.770
It's possible the Unsub
is making a statement

24:53.804 --> 24:56.019
about the damage mankind
is doing to the earth.

24:56.066 --> 24:58.221
The victims may have been
placed there on purpose

24:58.269 --> 24:59.696
as symbolic offerings.

24:59.743 --> 25:01.892
This could explain why
the Unsub forces the victims

25:01.939 --> 25:04.494
to kill themselves.
The hand that defiled the earth

25:04.541 --> 25:06.852
is turned on itself.

25:06.898 --> 25:08.598
It could also explain
why he's marking people

25:08.645 --> 25:10.400
of exceptionally
high moral character.

25:10.447 --> 25:12.724
Hey, you're done already?

25:12.771 --> 25:14.304
All right,
we'll see you next time.

25:14.351 --> 25:16.840
In ancient societies, only the
purest of mind and spirit

25:16.887 --> 25:18.163
were offered up as sacrifices.

25:18.210 --> 25:20.359
So the Unsub may believe
that what he is doing

25:20.407 --> 25:22.840
is actually both noble
and morally right.

25:22.888 --> 25:25.617
In philosophy it's called
the doctrine of double effect,

25:25.665 --> 25:28.664
which states that it is permissible
to do something harmful

25:28.712 --> 25:30.786
if it results in a greater good.

25:30.870 --> 25:34.111
The most recent killing shows a
disturbing uptick in violence

25:34.159 --> 25:36.493
and the killer's
willingness to take risks.

25:36.541 --> 25:37.794
This could be a sign
he's devolving,

25:37.841 --> 25:39.304
and with this unraveling,

25:39.410 --> 25:41.331
the danger to the public
is likely to escalate.

25:41.378 --> 25:42.912
Thank you.

25:43.970 --> 25:45.712
Hey, good afternoon, sir.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.232
Um, what would you like today?

25:47.280 --> 25:51.108
What sounds good?
We have beef and chicken.

25:53.835 --> 25:56.441
Uh, why don't we
go with the beef.

25:56.520 --> 25:59.197
There you go.

26:04.162 --> 26:07.763
Um, you know, I'm gonna
sneak in some chicken, too,

26:07.890 --> 26:10.226
because you look hungry.

26:13.189 --> 26:14.998
Have a nice day.

26:18.750 --> 26:20.049
It's what I thought.

26:20.184 --> 26:22.544
Heavy concentration
of silky Clay

26:22.592 --> 26:24.545
mixed with gravel and rock.

26:24.630 --> 26:27.566
And it's not a natural
soil composite for the area,

26:27.613 --> 26:29.739
but it was present
at all 3 disposal sites.

26:29.787 --> 26:30.847
Which tells us what?

26:30.895 --> 26:33.233
Well, it's used
to repair sinkholes.

26:33.281 --> 26:37.329
And all of the victims, they were
placed just inside the transition area.

26:37.377 --> 26:38.359
You hear that, Reid?

26:38.373 --> 26:40.045
I did, and, you know,
it fits with our profile

26:40.092 --> 26:42.424
about the Unsub making a statement
about environmental ruin.

26:42.471 --> 26:45.461
You know, sinkholes have been on
the rise, actually, worldwide,

26:45.518 --> 26:47.983
due to urbanization,
drilling, fracking.

26:48.031 --> 26:48.949
Garcia?

26:48.997 --> 26:50.206
She's here.
Feed the beast.

26:50.263 --> 26:52.642
What can you tell us
about sinkholes in Florida?

26:52.717 --> 26:55.305
I can tell you that...

26:55.419 --> 26:57.062
Jinkies. Tread lightly,

26:57.110 --> 26:58.858
there are a gazillion of them.

26:58.906 --> 27:01.209
Over 500 in the tampa bay
area alone

27:01.257 --> 27:04.337
since records started being kept in 1974.
Why are you asking?

27:04.384 --> 27:05.865
We think our Unsub
is taking his victims

27:05.912 --> 27:07.800
to current or former sinkholes.

27:07.848 --> 27:10.820
We're trying to anticipate which
one he might pay a visit to next.

27:10.867 --> 27:14.135
Guys, are they cover-subsidence
or cover-collapse sinkholes?

27:14.220 --> 27:17.361
Given their shallow layer of repair,
I'd say they're cover-subsidence.

27:17.408 --> 27:19.096
I'd chime in
with an opinion as well

27:19.143 --> 27:21.451
if I knew what the hell
you two were talking about.

27:21.499 --> 27:23.624
Cover-subsidence is where
the ground very gradually

27:23.672 --> 27:25.721
begins to form a depression,
usually circular,

27:25.769 --> 27:27.238
over the course
of weeks or months.

27:27.285 --> 27:28.986
Cover-collapse
is the nasty one.

27:29.034 --> 27:30.574
That's when the earth
just suddenly

27:30.621 --> 27:32.576
goes out from under your
feet like a trapdoor.

27:32.624 --> 27:35.415
We can find out for sure what
these 3 were, but does it matter?

27:35.499 --> 27:37.315
It might. I'm basically
just looking for parameters

27:37.362 --> 27:40.640
to narrow down the search. I did a
latitude/longitude study of a few locations,

27:40.687 --> 27:42.006
but I couldn't find
a numerical pattern.

27:42.053 --> 27:43.433
Let me try a few
more algorithms, though.

27:43.480 --> 27:46.445
Maybe the date that the sinkholes
formed means something

27:46.493 --> 27:48.404
or the dates they were repaired.

27:48.453 --> 27:50.898
I don't know.
I'm just grasping at straws.

27:50.946 --> 27:52.938
We don't want to keep you
from your algorithms, kid.

27:52.985 --> 27:54.632
Get back to us
if you find something.

27:54.679 --> 27:56.367
All right. Thank you, bye.

28:08.837 --> 28:10.937
Mom?

28:18.006 --> 28:20.191
Mom?

28:21.463 --> 28:22.996
Mom.

28:26.905 --> 28:28.255
Mom, can you hear me?

28:28.809 --> 28:31.769
Mom, answer me.

28:40.246 --> 28:42.101
Mom, don't do that!

28:42.148 --> 28:43.614
Don't do that!
Stop that!

28:43.661 --> 28:47.284
Leave me alone! Stop, stop!
Give it back to me! Ohh!

28:47.681 --> 28:49.591
- Aah!
- Stop!

28:49.772 --> 28:50.738
Give it to me!

28:50.786 --> 28:52.374
Stay away from me! Ohh!

28:52.570 --> 28:54.680
Aah! Leave me alone!

28:54.727 --> 28:56.527
What are you doing?
Give it to me!

28:56.574 --> 28:58.784
Leave me alone!

28:58.831 --> 29:00.865
For god's sake, leave me alone!

29:01.350 --> 29:02.827
Mom!

29:02.945 --> 29:03.999
No!
Stop!

29:04.198 --> 29:05.561
Why did you do that? Why?!

29:05.609 --> 29:08.153
I hate that stuff!
And I hate you!

29:08.240 --> 29:10.974
Do you have any idea what I went
through to get that medicine, mom?

29:11.122 --> 29:12.910
It can't be replaced.
Do you realize that?

29:12.957 --> 29:14.887
Good! I want to go
back home.

29:14.935 --> 29:16.236
- No, it isn't!
- This is home.

29:16.286 --> 29:18.203
I want to go back
to where I was before!

29:18.251 --> 29:19.702
You said you hated Houston!

29:19.750 --> 29:22.877
No, I want to go back
to where I was before before!

29:23.118 --> 29:24.706
Before!

29:52.910 --> 29:56.612
Well, that was just
what I needed.

29:56.659 --> 29:57.706
Hmm?

29:57.808 --> 30:01.243
My nap. It really
did the trick.

30:01.570 --> 30:03.619
Oh, my goodness.

30:03.666 --> 30:05.409
My scrapbook.

30:05.661 --> 30:09.517
Oh, I've been keeping this
since I don't know when.

30:09.838 --> 30:13.895
I have no idea
how it got here, but...

30:14.120 --> 30:16.720
Ohh, honey.

30:16.932 --> 30:18.667
What did you do to your face?

30:18.714 --> 30:19.957
It's all red.

30:20.004 --> 30:21.272
Probably bumped into something.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.516
Oh, you need to be more careful.
It's really awful.

30:23.564 --> 30:24.439
I will.

30:24.487 --> 30:26.041
You know, you always
were so clumsy.

30:26.088 --> 30:28.537
Smart as a whip. But I
used to call you crash.

30:28.596 --> 30:30.429
You were always
bumping into things.

30:39.923 --> 30:42.566
Ohh...

31:07.084 --> 31:09.606
Good news. We got a hit
on the Unsub's DNA.

31:09.653 --> 31:10.956
How is that not great news?

31:11.004 --> 31:11.933
What's his name?

31:11.981 --> 31:13.147
That's why it's not great news.

31:13.194 --> 31:14.436
We don't have a name.

31:14.484 --> 31:16.467
The DNA match was
to a series of 6

31:16.515 --> 31:18.761
unsolved murders in
the Tampa/St. Pete region

31:18.809 --> 31:20.329
stretching back nearly 3 years.

31:20.376 --> 31:21.530
Who were these victims?

31:21.577 --> 31:23.804
Local women. Mostly
in their early 20s,

31:23.889 --> 31:25.989
appeared to be victims
of opportunity.

31:26.036 --> 31:27.852
Sexually assaulted, strangled,

31:27.902 --> 31:29.734
and then dumped by the
side of the interstate.

31:29.782 --> 31:31.907
Was there any ritualistic
behavior associated

31:31.954 --> 31:33.200
with these earlier murders?

31:33.248 --> 31:36.426
None. These killings were as
straightforward as it gets.

31:36.714 --> 31:38.680
And then 10 months ago,
the murders stopped.

31:38.727 --> 31:41.800
A shift in m.O. This dramatic
doesn't just happen on its own.

31:41.848 --> 31:45.087
Something seismic rocked
our Unsub's world.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.667
A woman named Eleanor
Parsons is missing.

31:47.770 --> 31:51.630
She worked as a volunteer
at a local homeless shelter.

31:52.347 --> 31:53.746
Honey, what is this?

31:53.853 --> 31:55.263
Oh, it's a ticket stub.

31:55.310 --> 31:56.620
What is that?

31:56.667 --> 31:59.768
A ticket stub? When you go
to a concert or a movie

31:59.815 --> 32:02.397
you get a ticket
so they'll let you in.

32:02.470 --> 32:05.401
You saw Elvis in concert?

32:06.111 --> 32:07.376
I don't know.

32:07.446 --> 32:10.641
I did many things
when I was young.

32:10.692 --> 32:12.447
- Who is he?
- Elvis Presley.

32:12.495 --> 32:15.829
He's a very famous
Rock and Roll Singer.

32:19.421 --> 32:22.795
Ah! Oh, my gosh!

32:22.960 --> 32:24.893
I'd almost forgotten about this.

32:24.940 --> 32:25.913
What is that?

32:25.961 --> 32:27.184
When you were a little boy,

32:27.283 --> 32:29.293
I took you to the circus,
and after that,

32:29.341 --> 32:30.536
all you could talk about

32:30.607 --> 32:32.634
is you wanted to be
a tightrope Walker

32:32.681 --> 32:34.024
when you grew up.

32:34.071 --> 32:35.408
I thought I wanted
to be a magician.

32:35.455 --> 32:37.957
You did. That was later.
This was first.

32:38.013 --> 32:40.675
Really? I don't remember
that at all.

32:40.722 --> 32:43.645
Oh, no wonder. You were
no more than 3 or 4.

32:43.692 --> 32:45.137
What's on its head?

32:45.185 --> 32:46.765
- It's you!
- That's me?

32:46.813 --> 32:49.407
Yes. You glued that
on there yourself.

32:49.455 --> 32:50.506
Why did I do that?

32:50.554 --> 32:51.870
Well, here.

32:51.918 --> 32:54.583
See this little scar
right there on your wrist?

32:54.631 --> 32:55.909
That's from where you fell

32:56.030 --> 32:59.377
when you were trying to balance
on our backyard fence.

32:59.810 --> 33:03.253
Oh, you were so determined
to make it the whole way.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.123
And I'll never forget looking
out the kitchen window,

33:06.244 --> 33:08.670
watching you out there
as you were trying to make

33:08.717 --> 33:11.180
a balancing pole
from a broomstick.

33:11.228 --> 33:14.270
Calculating how long
it should be

33:14.476 --> 33:18.402
and making adjustments.
My little budding genius.

33:18.517 --> 33:19.547
Did I ever make it?

33:19.625 --> 33:22.722
No. And you were
heartbroken.

33:22.770 --> 33:26.933
You see, the problem
was, you were so smart,

33:27.019 --> 33:29.050
you were so brilliant,

33:29.098 --> 33:31.195
you really believed
that you could solve anything

33:31.243 --> 33:32.998
if you just put
your brain into it.

33:33.175 --> 33:34.916
But that tightrope...

33:34.964 --> 33:37.473
No, you just couldn't
figure that out.

33:37.835 --> 33:41.124
But you were meant
for bigger things, Spencer.

33:41.408 --> 33:43.965
Now, how do you tell that
to a 4-year-old boy?

33:44.419 --> 33:46.308
Mmm.

33:52.075 --> 33:54.128
Our current profile of the Unsub

33:54.176 --> 33:56.119
doesn't apply
to his earlier killings.

33:56.167 --> 33:58.831
Those had no ritual and a
strong sexual component.

33:58.879 --> 34:01.823
Ok, so something happened
in the 10 months

34:01.870 --> 34:03.480
between here and here.

34:03.527 --> 34:06.475
Something big. Because
when the Unsub emerged

34:06.525 --> 34:08.985
to start killing again,
his victimology and M.O.

34:09.032 --> 34:10.219
Had done a complete 180.

34:10.266 --> 34:11.967
We think he may have
burned himself, right?

34:12.014 --> 34:15.891
Maybe he was in some sort of
accident during that time.

34:15.938 --> 34:17.304
What kind of accident?

34:17.351 --> 34:19.152
No idea.

34:20.047 --> 34:23.783
What? Alvez doesn't have a
monopoly on grasping at straws.

34:23.847 --> 34:27.170
Well, we know sinkholes
suddenly became important.

34:27.263 --> 34:28.483
Let's start there.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.353
Garcia, please tell us
you found something.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.804
Did I ever,
and right in the 10-month

34:33.851 --> 34:35.527
sweet spot between murders.

34:35.574 --> 34:39.458
Turns out, one not-so-fine
morning, April 2015,

34:39.563 --> 34:41.829
a sinkhole opened up
in St. Petersburg,

34:41.877 --> 34:45.196
swallowing the humble home
of Fred and Marnie Jarvis,

34:45.282 --> 34:46.790
with them in it.

34:46.837 --> 34:47.795
Did they survive?

34:47.844 --> 34:50.047
Heavens, no. They got sucked
into the bowels of the earth,

34:50.094 --> 34:52.139
never to be seen again.
However, that had an adult son

34:52.187 --> 34:53.661
living with them
at the time, Bryce.

34:53.710 --> 34:56.213
He was able to scramble out before
the whole place went bye-bye.

34:56.260 --> 34:59.209
Why do I have a sense there's more
to the Jarvis family history?

34:59.294 --> 35:01.516
Because there is,
and the road is strange,

35:01.564 --> 35:03.280
so set your tasers to weird.

35:03.346 --> 35:04.679
It turns out the jarvises

35:04.727 --> 35:07.173
ran some sort of discount
spiritual center

35:07.221 --> 35:08.571
out of their two-car garage.

35:08.619 --> 35:10.033
It was a mish-mash of,
I don't know,

35:10.090 --> 35:12.249
like old testament
fire and brimstone

35:12.313 --> 35:15.652
mixed with Halloween Goblins
and Snake Oil commerce.

35:15.699 --> 35:17.490
Was Bryce involved
with the family business?

35:17.547 --> 35:19.628
Mm-mmm. Bryce hated his parents,

35:19.676 --> 35:20.902
his parents loathed him.

35:20.949 --> 35:22.569
Back in the day,
local child services

35:22.618 --> 35:24.427
had the Jarvis residence
on speed dial.

35:24.474 --> 35:26.808
There was rumors of sexual abuse.
It was never proven.

35:26.855 --> 35:29.299
But he continued to live
with them as an adult?

35:29.346 --> 35:31.787
Yeah. Bryce could not hold down a job.
He had no place to go.

35:31.835 --> 35:34.103
Anyway, a couple of years ago,
Fred and Marnie

35:34.151 --> 35:36.375
got put in county lockup
for 6 months.

35:36.453 --> 35:37.583
On what charge?

35:37.647 --> 35:40.097
Fraud. It turns out
that the jarvises

35:40.147 --> 35:41.801
were selling ointment
that they claimed

35:41.849 --> 35:44.282
when spread liberally on one's
face and arms and hands,

35:44.330 --> 35:45.757
would repel Satan.

35:45.862 --> 35:47.505
And, yes, you heard
that correctly.

35:47.553 --> 35:49.032
No need to adjust your headsets.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.816
While they were locked up,
Bryce had a nervous breakdown.

35:51.864 --> 35:53.874
He spent time
in the state hospital.

35:53.922 --> 35:55.970
Let me guess.
Shortly after his release,

35:56.018 --> 35:58.101
the murders of
the 6 young women started.

35:58.149 --> 35:59.507
Exactly two weeks later.

35:59.557 --> 36:00.814
Do we know where Bryce is now?

36:00.862 --> 36:02.812
No. That's what made me
stand up and pay attention.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.708
Because when I can't
find somebody, that means

36:04.756 --> 36:05.722
that someone doesn't want
to be findable,

36:05.770 --> 36:07.492
and I'm gonna keep searching.

36:22.833 --> 36:24.032
Time to go.

36:25.345 --> 36:27.979
There's one more trip
you have to take.

36:32.643 --> 36:37.801
Hey. I made you some tea.

36:38.191 --> 36:40.101
How are you feeling?

36:40.329 --> 36:42.050
Who are you?

36:44.989 --> 36:46.060
Spencer.

36:46.108 --> 36:47.051
Hmm?

36:47.120 --> 36:48.452
Your son.

36:52.452 --> 36:54.888
It's been a really long day.

36:55.044 --> 36:57.779
You should probably sleep now.

37:34.171 --> 37:35.207
Emily.

37:35.255 --> 37:36.415
What is it, Reid?

37:36.463 --> 37:38.809
I think our Unsub
is trying to literally

37:38.857 --> 37:40.364
send his victims to hell.

37:40.412 --> 37:41.486
What are you talking about?

37:41.534 --> 37:43.878
Sinkholes don't just exist
in a geologic context.

37:43.926 --> 37:45.151
They also have
a symbolic history.

37:45.199 --> 37:48.098
In Mexico they're called
cenotes, and the ancient Mayans

37:48.162 --> 37:49.985
believed them to be portals
to the underworld.

37:50.073 --> 37:53.121
They even made human sacrifices
to certain cenotes.

37:53.168 --> 37:56.010
The suicide aspect
of the Unsub's ritual

37:56.105 --> 37:57.367
makes sense now.

37:57.488 --> 37:58.738
That is a sin, right?

37:58.786 --> 38:00.677
And you can't go to hell
unless you've sinned.

38:00.725 --> 38:04.213
In Bryce's mind, the devil opened up
the earth and swallowed his parents.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.234
Now this is his way
of showing his gratitude.

38:06.290 --> 38:09.359
That's why he must be choosing
especially virtuous victims,

38:09.473 --> 38:11.866
people who have tickets
to a front-row seat in heaven.

38:11.958 --> 38:13.930
Until Bryce stamped them
null and void

38:13.977 --> 38:15.417
and sent them
in the other direction.

38:15.465 --> 38:16.689
There's more.
I think the mark

38:16.737 --> 38:17.910
he's making on his victims' arms

38:17.958 --> 38:20.332
is a rough rendering
of the Ophiuchus Star Cluster.

38:20.529 --> 38:22.591
Which is?

38:23.095 --> 38:25.140
The Ophiuchus Star Cluster

38:25.218 --> 38:26.802
is the constellation
of the devil.

38:26.871 --> 38:30.048
3 of the disposal sites correlates with
a 3-star section of the constellation.

38:30.096 --> 38:32.598
So he could be using that as
a guide to dumping the bodies.

38:32.683 --> 38:34.650
Is there a discernible
pattern of progression?

38:34.698 --> 38:36.284
It's hard to say for sure,
but my guess is

38:36.332 --> 38:38.125
he'll be heading to a
sinkhole in the vicinity

38:38.173 --> 38:42.406
of latitude 27.75,
longitude minus 82.25.

38:42.606 --> 38:44.941
Meaning here, here, or here.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.875
We'll split the team.
Let's move.

38:46.922 --> 38:48.243
Come on!

38:48.297 --> 38:50.020
Oh! Ow! Ow!

38:50.068 --> 38:52.605
Get up! Get up. Get up.

38:53.478 --> 38:55.424
Why are you doing this?

38:55.472 --> 38:56.518
Jump.

38:56.565 --> 38:57.704
No!

38:57.803 --> 39:00.025
Do it! Do it!

39:00.192 --> 39:01.987
I won't!

39:02.690 --> 39:04.259
You have a granddaughter
named Tess.

39:04.306 --> 39:05.488
Ohh...

39:05.637 --> 39:07.413
Jump or she dies tomorrow.

39:07.543 --> 39:09.920
No. You'll kill her
anyway.

39:10.048 --> 39:11.658
I'm not jumping.

39:11.969 --> 39:14.757
You're just gonna
have to kill me first.

39:15.017 --> 39:16.930
If that's what you want.

39:17.107 --> 39:18.478
Bryce Jarvis, FBI!

39:18.642 --> 39:19.941
Step away from the cliff!

39:28.706 --> 39:29.740
Don't.

39:29.787 --> 39:30.794
No, let me go!

39:30.842 --> 39:33.322
No, not quite, not quite.

39:54.198 --> 39:55.766
Hey.

39:55.813 --> 39:57.757
Can I try some?

39:57.805 --> 39:58.893
Help yourself.

39:58.941 --> 40:02.350
I'm a white wine
kind of gal, but...

40:06.151 --> 40:09.497
Whoo, yeah, that just woke up
my back molars, thank you.

40:09.646 --> 40:11.507
Like the best things in life,

40:11.573 --> 40:13.815
an acquired taste.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.923
Do you think Spence
is making a mistake

40:20.150 --> 40:21.620
bringing his mom home?

40:21.727 --> 40:23.760
It's hard to say.

40:23.950 --> 40:25.876
Not long ago I told him
he shouldn't waste

40:25.924 --> 40:28.743
the precious time
he has left with her.

40:29.014 --> 40:31.546
I guess he took it to heart.

40:33.772 --> 40:36.673
I worry about him, you know?

40:37.416 --> 40:38.744
Yeah, it'll be fine.

40:38.843 --> 40:42.557
If it proves too difficult,
he'll adjust.

40:42.842 --> 40:46.161
I just have a bad feeling...

40:46.840 --> 40:48.102
About what?

40:48.214 --> 40:49.738
I don't even know.

40:49.965 --> 40:51.967
I can't put my finger on it.

40:54.468 --> 40:56.605
JJ, we have enough
problems in this life

40:56.652 --> 40:58.857
that are real and present.

40:59.109 --> 41:02.944
Let's not bring imagined
ones to the table, too.

41:03.502 --> 41:06.514
Ok. I will drink to that.

41:07.586 --> 41:10.452
Oh, in spirit.
