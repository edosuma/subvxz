(knock on door)

01:48.692 --> 01:50.693
(clears throat)
Yeah!

01:56.325 --> 01:58.159
When did you turn recluse?

01:58.327 --> 02:00.870
You and the Jew settled in?

02:01.038 --> 02:04.540
The Jew's a born
fucking householder.

02:04.708 --> 02:08.836
Scouts furniture in the fucking
catalogues morning and night.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.508
The Mrs. Ellsworth's a 10-day miracle.

02:15.511 --> 02:18.012
Up and about
and up and fucking doing.

02:18.180 --> 02:21.224
Meets with fucking Hearst today,
her and fucking Ellsworth,

02:21.391 --> 02:24.018
that I'd have thought would have
steered her fucking clear.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.979
- Hearst's invite?
- Lady's bright idea.

02:30.859 --> 02:34.654
I've pretext enough if you'd
have me call to dissuade her.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.532
Don't you get in the fucking middle.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.036
Jesus fucking Christ, Al.

02:42.204 --> 02:45.122
She might as well set herself afire.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.921
I can't imagine that
cocksucker got to you...

02:52.089 --> 02:55.550
or you're folding your fucking tent.
The last shot ain't yet fired.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.510
Stage is coming.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.059
My God, look at Wu.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.770
Lost his mind in San Francisco.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.939
You think he married the nigger?

03:11.483 --> 03:13.067
I'm talking about his suit.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.861
AW:
Mr. Blazanov!

03:15.028 --> 03:18.573
- Mr. Merrick!
- (laughs)

03:35.007 --> 03:36.674
Oh God.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.219
I am barely speaking to you.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.929
Who the fuck is that?

03:43.181 --> 03:46.642
A shabby shabby exit
from Virginia City.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.769
No "Farewell, Jack."

03:48.937 --> 03:51.272
No "By your leave." Nothing.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.482
Did you notice I was being pursued?

03:53.650 --> 03:56.235
Is that us over there?

03:56.403 --> 03:58.779
That is we, my dear, yes.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.782
I will install us momentarily.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.284
Countess.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.953
I stay till the costumes
come down.

04:06.121 --> 04:09.165
Admirable.
Only the most minimal of civilities:

04:09.333 --> 04:12.543
"Hello, how are you?"
"A bit warmer today than Tuesday."

04:12.711 --> 04:15.296
That last may be too forgiving.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.841
Hearst: Aunt Lou!

04:20.010 --> 04:22.094
- Hey.
- (laughs)

04:23.305 --> 04:24.764
Good to see you.

04:26.725 --> 04:30.102
- Hearst's meals are about to improve.
- Watch your step here, darling.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.729
- Come on in.
- Okay.

04:38.528 --> 04:42.865
Go away. Stay close to the Jew.
If it's Ellsworth apprising you of the widow,

04:43.033 --> 04:46.118
let him fucking continue
and do likewise for me.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.747
That's more fucking like it.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.836
Doc:
Very considerate of you

04:56.004 --> 04:58.631
to come to me when
I thought I was coming to you.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.592
As I was feeling well,
I thought you'd agree

05:01.760 --> 05:04.387
the exercise might be beneficial.

05:04.554 --> 05:08.391
Does your examination
confirm my suspicions?

05:08.558 --> 05:09.892
As to how I'm feeling?

05:10.060 --> 05:12.019
It does.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.313
You seem fully recovered.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.649
I'm delighted to be recovered.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.820
- And to find my own judgments reliable.
- (coughs)

05:20.988 --> 05:22.822
I would, however,

05:22.990 --> 05:25.992
advise against rushing
back into things.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.286
Would any meeting between us
be complete, Doctor,

05:29.454 --> 05:32.289
until I'd had your counsel
against something?

05:32.457 --> 05:34.834
Have you finished
taking the medicine I gave you?

05:35.002 --> 05:39.255
- Implying what, Dr. Cochran?
- I'm implying nothing, Mrs. Ellsworth.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.298
I'm putting a question to you.

05:43.135 --> 05:46.429
I disposed of the medicine
you gave me, Dr. Cochran,

05:46.596 --> 05:50.141
knowing I had a weakness for it,
without having finished taking it.

05:50.308 --> 05:54.395
- I see.
- You seem incapable of crediting me

05:54.563 --> 05:56.063
as a full and...

05:56.231 --> 06:00.151
- normal person.
- I credit you as exactly that, madam,

06:00.318 --> 06:03.279
which is to say as having limits
like the rest of us,

06:03.447 --> 06:05.656
and to urge upon you the humility

06:05.824 --> 06:09.243
of not asking more of yourself
than is reasonable.

06:09.411 --> 06:13.414
And I'd add my observation that
refusal to make such adjustment

06:13.582 --> 06:15.458
sometimes is symptom in women

06:15.625 --> 06:19.003
of an inadequate recovery
from the rigors you've just endured.

06:20.422 --> 06:23.215
- You say this as my physician?
- Yes.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.844
- Not my reprover or rebuker?
- No.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.766
Then thank you, Doctor.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.101
And good morning.

06:38.899 --> 06:43.444
You ain't getting no cobbler, Mr. Hearst,
till I get my hands on them boots.

06:43.612 --> 06:47.281
Uh, here they come. Here they come.

06:47.449 --> 06:50.117
Not one spoonful till I got 'em clean.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.661
(sighs)
Filthy.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.081
It's frontier living out here, Aunt Lou.

06:55.248 --> 06:59.418
Where I go, ain't no frontier.
I bring some standards with me.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.337
Ah...

07:01.505 --> 07:04.048
I miss Missouri yet, Aunt Lou.

07:04.216 --> 07:07.885
Wasn't the world
peak of ripe back then?

07:08.053 --> 07:10.513
Didn't even the birds
seem to sing different?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.349
- More like they meant it.
- More like they meant it. You understand.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.477
I don't suppose you operate
another pair in secret.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.729
You know I wouldn't fib.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.731
I'll brush 'em up directly.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.985
I got you living right here
in the building, Aunt Lou.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.947
I wouldn't even think about
any other arrangements.

07:29.491 --> 07:33.160
Mighty generous, Mr. Hearst.
Mighty brave.

07:33.328 --> 07:37.498
- Will you take a walk, see the camp?
- I'll take a walk as far as my kitchen.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.792
I should have known you'd say that.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.503
- You want that peach cobbler, don't you?
- I do for a fact.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.880
And they know downstairs who's boss.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.925
Is this here a rich place, Mr. Hearst?

07:48.093 --> 07:51.137
Oh, very very rich, Aunt Lou.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.639
For pure scale,

07:53.807 --> 07:56.642
maybe the richest find I've seen.

07:57.853 --> 08:00.229
Guess we can live
without them birds then.

08:08.446 --> 08:13.284
The high points of the fucking
high points of your trip, Wu.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.328
'Cause I won't be able
to follow you anyway.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.498
Wu. San Francisco.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.542
You look like a fucking idiot,

08:21.710 --> 08:24.587
if no one has yet conveyed
to you the truth.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.798
Wu, San Francisco, Hearst.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.384
Yeah, you in San Francisco,

08:30.552 --> 08:32.510
collecting workers for Hearst.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.013
Ho.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.640
How soon, fucking Wu?

08:36.808 --> 08:39.101
The many Chinks
in Hearst's employ?

08:39.269 --> 08:41.687
Huh?

08:45.859 --> 08:47.693
Hello hello hello hello!

08:47.861 --> 08:49.695
The many Chinks here, huh?!

08:51.114 --> 08:52.448
How soon?

08:52.616 --> 08:54.241
Ah!

08:54.409 --> 08:56.327
10 day.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.413
"10-Day Wu."

08:59.581 --> 09:02.416
Clever cocksucker. You come back
with more fucking English.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.501
Ho.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.296
Now once I get my ducks in order,

09:07.464 --> 09:12.009
you will give your information
to Hearst in a sit-down,

09:12.177 --> 09:15.930
so we can gauge
his attitude toward me.

09:16.097 --> 09:19.725
Wu, Hearst, Swedgin.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.769
Swedgin must act as translator,

09:21.937 --> 09:24.104
as he is the only one in camp

09:24.272 --> 09:26.065
versed in both languages.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.234
Ho.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.365
Chung Kuo. Am I right
or am I fucking wrong?

09:34.532 --> 09:37.576
- Chung Kuo.
- Chung Kuo, heng dai.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.996
- Heng dai.
- Heng dai, Chung Kuo.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.624
And I'll tell you when
the meeting is, huh?

09:49.673 --> 09:51.507
Welcome home, Wu.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.384
Mmm.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.266
Ellsworth: It's arrogance,
nothing more to goddamn less.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.352
Alma: Do not use profanity,
please, speaking to me.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.479
For goodness sake.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.690
Apologizing for my language,

10:07.857 --> 10:10.234
I ask you consider my meaning.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.903
It hardly seems arrogant to me

10:13.071 --> 10:16.824
to seek an equitable and mutually
beneficial resolution with Mr. Hearst.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.827
Then spare him that paper
with your pretty ideas.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.912
Tell him your price
for how much you'll sell,

10:22.080 --> 10:24.081
because Hearst don't
let his partners set policy.

10:24.249 --> 10:28.085
I hadn't realized you were so intimate
with his business methods.

10:28.253 --> 10:31.255
Please don't be smart with me.
Not about this.

10:31.423 --> 10:35.050
"This," Mr. Ellsworth,
being the question of my mine?

10:35.218 --> 10:37.386
Well, what in the hell else would it be?!

10:37.554 --> 10:39.138
Excuse me.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.265
I will meet with Mr. Hearst.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.476
I'll be delighted if you should
choose to accompany me.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.479
Oh, I ain't one to miss a train wreck.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.358
Though if you cannot forbear
from patronizing me,

10:51.526 --> 10:54.069
I'd prefer you didn't come at all.

10:55.739 --> 10:59.325
All right, Mrs. Ellsworth, all right.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.660
Empty.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.581
You sure you don't want me
to work behind here, boss?

11:05.749 --> 11:07.499
If I wanted you working behind here,

11:07.667 --> 11:10.461
you'd be fucking working behind here.
Fucking work over there.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.630
It occurs to me, Al, as you and he

11:13.798 --> 11:15.883
are so evidently well-acquainted,

11:16.051 --> 11:20.679
the decent interval that Mr. Langrishe
is owed to make his domestic arrangements

11:20.847 --> 11:23.015
I might spend hearing you talk of him.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.684
Ever wonder if you
expressed yourself more directly,

11:25.852 --> 11:27.686
Merrick, you might fucking weigh less?

11:27.854 --> 11:29.688
I see no logic in that whatever.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.191
I don't want to talk of Langrishe.
He makes me fucking nervous.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.692
On what account?

11:33.860 --> 11:36.945
I can't say on what account.
That type, the type you don't know

11:37.113 --> 11:40.783
exactly how you feel about him
is who you're made nervous by.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.410
Young man!

11:43.578 --> 11:46.330
Keeping the wolf away, I see.

11:46.498 --> 11:49.333
Jack.

11:49.501 --> 11:53.003
John Langrishe, sir.
The operator has the manners of a pig.

11:53.171 --> 11:56.548
AW Merrick, Mr. Langrishe,
publisher of "The Deadwood Pioneer."

11:56.716 --> 11:59.301
Ah! Accounting for the halo
I see above you.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.345
Shit blizzard's early today.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.514
He takes his tone with you as a familiar.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.517
Oh, we're well-acquainted,
Mr. Swearengen and I.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.478
Mmm, new friends, old campaigners.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.313
The infrequent bloody win.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.941
Always superfluous, bloodshed.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.402
The deeper damage is best.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.906
- Ahh!
- (laughs)

12:30.208 --> 12:32.793
Candidly, Richardson,

12:32.961 --> 12:35.838
as I imagine you foraging
for berries and grubs,

12:36.005 --> 12:38.799
and flicking at insects
with your sticky tongue,

12:38.967 --> 12:41.176
I feel a certain dismay.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.928
What are you talking about?

12:43.096 --> 12:45.389
You are to be discharged, fool.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.975
As, I suspect in a wink of time,

12:48.143 --> 12:50.436
once some stage
from a different direction

12:50.603 --> 12:52.521
arrives with my replacement, am I.

12:52.689 --> 12:53.772
What did we do wrong?

12:53.940 --> 12:56.191
Your error, surprisingly enough,

12:56.359 --> 12:58.277
is not to be a grotesque

12:58.445 --> 13:00.529
of inconceivable stupidity,

13:00.697 --> 13:02.531
but that you are white and male

13:02.699 --> 13:05.951
and not repulsively obese.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.953
As for my own,

13:08.121 --> 13:09.538
I wonder if it lies

13:09.706 --> 13:11.915
in an excessive courtesy

13:12.083 --> 13:14.334
and eagerness to please.

13:15.753 --> 13:19.089
Shoo, skunk. Shoo.
Go go.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.133
Mr. Hearst.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.302
Farnum, have you
a moment for us to talk?

13:23.470 --> 13:26.346
I do.
I'd ask only that you be brief

13:26.514 --> 13:30.893
and forbear from false camaraderie.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.898
Come, Hearst, I've seen the Ethiop.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.566
Who indeed could miss her?

13:37.734 --> 13:41.445
And even as she supplants Richardson,
what person, I wonder,

13:41.613 --> 13:44.323
of what depraved exotic origin

13:44.491 --> 13:46.950
have you engaged to take my place?

13:48.870 --> 13:51.538
I hadn't thought of replacing you.
Do you want me to?

13:54.542 --> 13:57.419
The world begins to dance
before my eyes.

13:57.587 --> 14:01.798
As for Richardson, Aunt Lou
will be taking his position,

14:01.966 --> 14:04.468
but he can keep doing
whatever else it is that he does

14:04.636 --> 14:06.512
with no reduction in wage.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.681
What a surprising and gratifying turn.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.809
Paid through Tuesday.
That one's paid through Thursday.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.689
Having secured your approval
as to my hiring plans,

14:17.857 --> 14:21.109
I wonder now if I might elicit
the information I came for,

14:21.277 --> 14:23.529
which is in regard to Mrs. Ellsworth.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.990
I am abjectly at your disposal.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.703
For some time,

14:31.871 --> 14:35.499
without the unseemliness
of approaching her directly,

14:35.667 --> 14:37.918
I have sought without success

14:38.086 --> 14:40.754
to generate a connection
with Mrs. Ellsworth.

14:40.922 --> 14:44.091
A haughty cunt.
Formerly weak for dope.

14:44.259 --> 14:48.971
Most fundamentally a sexual peccant,
though I'm sworn against providing specifics.

14:51.599 --> 14:54.643
Now, as it seems of her own volition,

14:54.811 --> 14:58.230
Mrs. Ellsworth appoints to meet with me,

14:58.398 --> 15:00.607
leading me to wonder what change

15:00.775 --> 15:02.776
in her situation prompts her approach.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.529
I will look into that, sir,
vigorously and immediately.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.864
- You don't know.
- I do not know at present.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.783
Just send her up when she get here.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.452
I can seek the knowledge out.
I can pursue it as a first priority.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.121
Just send her the fuck up!

15:14.289 --> 15:16.123
All right, sir. And may I say...

15:16.291 --> 15:18.834
how delighted I am
our relation is to continue?

15:34.475 --> 15:36.560
- Why don't you see to your type?
- Excuse me?

15:36.728 --> 15:38.770
Type. Don't you use type
to print out your words?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.814
Uh, well, I'd hoped to secure
from Mr. Langrishe--

15:40.982 --> 15:45.152
I want copious discourse between us,
Mr. Merrick. Where shall I find you soon?

15:45.320 --> 15:48.322
- We could speak now if you wish.
- No, not now, young man.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.324
Not immediately.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.701
But soon. Very very soon.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.621
Where is your lair,
that I may beard you?

15:55.788 --> 15:58.707
(laughs)
My lair adjoins The Gem.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.876
- Wonderful.
- I can be bearded there most hours.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.836
- Fine.
- (both laugh)

16:03.004 --> 16:05.797
Thank you very much.
Thank, uh-- very nice to meet you, sir.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.758
The camp is lucky to have you.

16:07.925 --> 16:11.595
- Uh, no way, actually, you can know that.
- Go on there, Merrick. Get away.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.056
Oh, incessant and unrelenting,

16:14.223 --> 16:16.183
exactly that type of banter.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.768
I'll just go out the front.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.354
You know, I could go
out that way, but I--

16:20.521 --> 16:23.690
I'll--
(clears throat)

16:23.858 --> 16:26.735
You're looking fucking well, Jack.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.571
It's the learning fucking nothing, Al,

16:29.739 --> 16:31.907
that keeps me young.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.662
Please. I hope you'll
forgive the disarray.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.081
I seem to feel a greater priority

16:39.248 --> 16:41.667
about making space for myself

16:41.834 --> 16:43.794
than adorning the space I've made.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.297
- Refreshments?
- No.

16:47.465 --> 16:50.050
I must say I feel

16:50.218 --> 16:52.678
less the grown man just now

16:52.845 --> 16:55.055
than a boy from Missouri.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.225
My Aunt Lou Marchbanks

16:58.393 --> 16:59.851
has come to camp.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.437
- Is your aunt's visit a surprise?
- No.

17:02.605 --> 17:05.315
Heavens no, no.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.442
Expecting my stay to be brief,

17:07.609 --> 17:09.444
I left her at other diggings.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.071
Your Aunt Lou prospects too?

17:12.240 --> 17:14.491
- My aunt's my nigger cook.
- I see.

17:14.659 --> 17:19.287
Wonderful wonderful cook. And a tyrant,
of course, as the best ones always are.

17:19.454 --> 17:21.580
I quite quake before her.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.542
- Do you?
- About our conversation too,

17:24.711 --> 17:27.421
wanting so awfully much
we come to an agreement.

17:27.588 --> 17:32.050
Don't disappoint him,
being as he's 12 with his aunt in camp.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.762
I've learned that we shared time
in the Comstock, Mr. Ellsworth.

17:35.930 --> 17:39.015
- I'm sorry we didn't meet.
- Whatever's toward what he wants.

17:39.183 --> 17:42.644
Not a flying fuck if it's true
or how fucking soaked in blood.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.981
- That talk serves no purpose.
- What talk to a murderer does?

17:46.149 --> 17:48.942
I'd not be insulted
in my own rooms, Mr. Ellsworth.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.986
Where shall we go for me to do it?

17:51.154 --> 17:54.781
Will you be in this afternoon,
Mr. Hearst?

17:54.949 --> 17:57.242
- There's bodies in here.
- I certainly can be.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.412
The walls are down to make room
for 'em. I see every fucking one!

18:03.291 --> 18:06.376
- Perhaps we could speak later then.
- I will look forward to that.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.879
You don't look forward
to nothing far as her,

18:09.046 --> 18:10.964
you murdering cocksucker.
You hear me?

18:11.132 --> 18:12.966
I'm very glad to have met you.

18:13.134 --> 18:16.344
(Ellsworth panting)

18:32.111 --> 18:33.779
I recognize,

18:33.946 --> 18:36.198
perhaps as I never fully
recognized before,

18:36.365 --> 18:38.283
how profoundly you feel about him.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.951
I know him.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.789
I will present my offer to him.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.208
You will not. I will not permit it.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.960
You behave in his rooms

18:49.128 --> 18:51.129
as virtually a maniac

18:51.297 --> 18:53.507
and now assert
your superior prerogative?

18:53.674 --> 18:55.425
I forbid you, yes.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.224
(sighs)

19:07.730 --> 19:11.149
Well, I suppose that settles it.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.028
I know him.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.572
May I ask you to collect Sofia

19:17.740 --> 19:19.658
once you've seen me home?

19:19.826 --> 19:23.495
Do you understand?
In ways you can't.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.998
Mr. Ellsworth, you hardly need
explain yourself to me,

19:27.166 --> 19:30.502
your wife, in the thoroughfare,

19:30.670 --> 19:33.588
having once laid down the law.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.551
(crying, speaking foreign language)

19:42.139 --> 19:44.099
Hey. Look at me!

19:45.643 --> 19:47.644
Talk to me.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.732
He said they come up in cage.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.068
The guard was behind Jory.

19:56.237 --> 19:59.406
The guard wait for air change.
First breath from above,

19:59.574 --> 20:02.242
he push Jory to the wall,
catch his legs and cut them off.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.619
He saw it?

20:06.247 --> 20:09.541
Jory was organizing.
That's why they push him to the wall.

20:12.962 --> 20:16.047
- We're awful sorry.
- Get the fuck away from him!

20:16.215 --> 20:18.550
Utter: Get out of here.
Go ahead. Get on.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.888
Accident.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.308
(man speaking)

20:33.941 --> 20:36.693
Another friend, he says,
was shot 10 days ago in bar.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.695
At The Gem.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.655
The friend talked union too.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.908
Jory and him were in the bar
when he was shot.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.202
Now they're dead.
Pasco says he'll be next.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.330
(both crying)

21:01.552 --> 21:05.180
Tell them they can go
when they're done crying.

21:05.348 --> 21:09.059
Make them understand
I was only talking to him.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.316
Hole in the building's front wall,

21:16.484 --> 21:18.818
he can pop out at any moment.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.487
Hearst.

21:20.655 --> 21:23.573
I'd not have him see us together.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.241
Prudent.

21:26.786 --> 21:30.038
Ah, bacon.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.959
Might have a bit
of a human aftertaste.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.796
Lurid with Chinese.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.798
No one suggests a theater here.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.968
Only observing, turning you outward.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.845
(shouting Chinese)

21:51.018 --> 21:52.686
Boss of the neighborhood.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.188
Won a war to take over.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.902
One hopes you are his backer
and not his tailor.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.616
You're the first I've fucking
revealed this to.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.618
Fucking throbs all the way up.

22:08.786 --> 22:12.038
Goes with me to the grave.

22:12.206 --> 22:15.875
(blowing)
Yeah.

22:17.712 --> 22:20.505
Swearengen: You fucking tip
your hat to everybody?

22:20.673 --> 22:22.132
Langrishe: Everybody.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.220
Morning.

22:27.388 --> 22:31.016
We're low on our hardware,
just doing the order.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.229
Dogs...

22:36.397 --> 22:40.316
for him to laugh at
while we chase our tails.

22:42.236 --> 22:46.823
I'm gonna write it up anyway--
Hearst's phony fucking accident.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.743
I'm gonna present it to him

22:49.910 --> 22:51.745
and put him on notice.

22:58.377 --> 23:02.839
I'm concerned
about Mrs. Ellsworth, Trixie.

23:03.007 --> 23:07.302
If concerned means
"Is she using?"...

23:12.933 --> 23:14.768
I don't think she is.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.604
- I don't either.
- Then why'd you ask if she was?

23:17.772 --> 23:21.524
I didn't. You just took me
for asking that.

23:21.692 --> 23:24.152
- (coughs)
- Ask the one you want to then.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.989
(sighs) I'm concerned that
her temperament is...

23:28.157 --> 23:30.492
(coughs)
...is labile.

23:30.659 --> 23:34.120
(coughing)

23:34.288 --> 23:36.706
I guess that means
she's talking through her cunt?

23:38.793 --> 23:40.460
Her moods seem

23:40.628 --> 23:43.546
inappropriately variable.
(hacking)

23:43.714 --> 23:46.925
Saying "variable,"

23:47.093 --> 23:48.802
I don't disagree.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.596
I said so myself this morning
to somebody else.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.349
(coughing heavily)

23:56.352 --> 24:01.189
Did I fucking embarrass you, Doc,
that you'd go so fucking red?

24:01.357 --> 24:03.108
(continues coughing)

24:03.275 --> 24:06.694
Don't throw a fit, Doc.
Look, I'll put it out.

24:25.548 --> 24:27.549
This is new.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.845
This entire area

24:32.012 --> 24:34.222
is recent.

24:34.390 --> 24:35.723
The Ellsworth house,

24:35.891 --> 24:38.143
richest claim next to Hearst,
that woman.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.979
What sort of plays does she favor?

24:41.147 --> 24:44.232
Oh, Christ, she told me
and I fucking forgot.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.152
Goes through her men
like Sherman to the fucking sea.

24:49.363 --> 24:51.781
This--

24:53.075 --> 24:55.201
can't remember who
this fucking belongs to.

24:57.538 --> 24:59.706
And who does this fucking belong to?

25:01.041 --> 25:04.169
Well, I guess this belongs
to fucking everybody.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.509
The Bullock house. Fucking sheriff.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.636
Insane fucking person.

25:13.804 --> 25:16.222
(blows)

25:21.228 --> 25:23.062
The one at Swearengen's too

25:23.230 --> 25:25.648
I'll put him on notice about.

25:28.903 --> 25:30.862
I'm gonna put him on notice about it all.

25:35.367 --> 25:38.786
Wouldn't be looking for anyone coming
through the wall to deal with your Johnson.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.080
And don't you try fucking coming
to my side either,

25:41.248 --> 25:44.125
or your Jew head will be wearing
that fucking dresser as a tiara.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.668
All right.

25:45.836 --> 25:49.505
We're supposed to read your mind,
understand what you fucking mean.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.674
I mean...

25:51.842 --> 25:54.010
all right.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.387
Shut the fuck up.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.849
"Please don't smoke" means
"I'm at death's fucking door."

26:01.101 --> 26:02.602
You can smoke.

26:06.106 --> 26:09.317
I'd prefer...

26:09.485 --> 26:12.111
if you did it outside.

26:16.158 --> 26:18.493
You're a fucking idiot, anyways.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.709
Pus is a deeper yellow.

26:26.877 --> 26:29.337
Aw, cocksucker.

26:29.505 --> 26:33.132
What are you fucking staring at?
Fucking boot fits, huh?

26:34.802 --> 26:36.594
Jack:
Home base, young man.

26:36.762 --> 26:39.472
There's the whole fucking area
on the other side.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.349
I'm quite worn out.

26:41.517 --> 26:44.852
I fucking started this job,
I'll fucking finish it.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.355
This motherfucker.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.357
Al...

26:49.525 --> 26:53.528
it's not the first
impression I'd make.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.576
Heartfelt thanks.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.513
With such disagreement
among the statements, Mr. Bullock,

27:20.681 --> 27:24.100
on what basis could an inquiry
justifiably go forward?

27:24.268 --> 27:26.311
I put you on notice, Mr. Hearst,

27:26.478 --> 27:28.354
I identify a pattern in these events.

27:28.522 --> 27:30.356
(sighs)

27:30.524 --> 27:33.443
Unless some law
is broken, Mr. Bullock,

27:33.610 --> 27:35.862
whose sanctions
you have power to apply,

27:36.030 --> 27:38.281
why in fuck should I care

27:38.449 --> 27:40.867
what pattern you identify or don't?

27:41.035 --> 27:42.869
There is a sanction against murder.

27:43.037 --> 27:46.289
The man lost his legs in a shaft.
It happens quite often.

27:46.457 --> 27:49.208
I now learn that your worker
who died in The Gem last week

27:49.376 --> 27:53.254
- was killed by two of your guards.
- I defy you to prove that event

27:53.422 --> 27:56.466
about which the two of us
have spoken was murder.

27:56.633 --> 28:00.219
Whereas in the same
saloon nine days ago,

28:00.387 --> 28:03.056
two guards of mine,
giving no provocation,

28:03.223 --> 28:04.891
had their throats cut

28:05.059 --> 28:08.019
with two others of
my guards as witness.

28:08.187 --> 28:12.315
Certainly, the guards who survive
are capable of naming the killers.

28:12.483 --> 28:15.610
Shall I have them make complaint?

28:20.366 --> 28:22.909
I put you on notice.

28:33.587 --> 28:36.297
Many new people are
in the camp, Mr. Merrick.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.299
And a very eventful time we had

28:38.467 --> 28:40.301
during your absence, Mr. Blazanov.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.303
You and I will have much to discuss

28:42.471 --> 28:44.472
in our evening perambulations.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.393
- (crackling)
- Oh God.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.937
Okay. Main line coil,

28:51.105 --> 28:52.772
artificial line coil...

28:52.940 --> 28:55.650
- (tapping)
- new armature lever,

28:55.818 --> 28:57.652
separate battery, supplementaries.

28:57.820 --> 29:01.239
All new contrivances
I was instructed about in Chicago.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.033
Without this many innovations,

29:04.201 --> 29:06.411
differential duplex
would not be possible.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.913
Differential duplex?

29:09.081 --> 29:13.626
Can you speak in
a high voice, Mr. Merrick?

29:13.794 --> 29:16.212
I could speak in a low voice.

29:16.380 --> 29:20.383
(high voice)
Blazanov then will speak in high voice.

29:21.635 --> 29:24.595
Keep speaking on in your low voice

29:24.763 --> 29:29.350
while Blazanov at the same time
speaks highly. This is duplex telegraphy.

29:29.518 --> 29:32.270
From this point on,
I shall speak in my low voice.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.772
Both messages sent at the same time...

29:34.940 --> 29:38.067
Excuse me, but I can't understand
you when we both talk at once.

29:38.235 --> 29:41.863
...and recorded elsewhere by instruments

29:42.030 --> 29:45.825
with appropriate sensitivities.

29:48.036 --> 29:51.581
Well, I-- I won't keep you
from your work.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.961
- Mr. Merrick?
- Hmm?

29:57.129 --> 30:00.047
I met a girl in Chicago.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.508
Oh, yes?

30:02.676 --> 30:05.261
Also for our...

30:05.429 --> 30:07.513
perambulations.

30:07.681 --> 30:09.640
Hmm.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.394
Yeah.

30:13.562 --> 30:16.522
Seeing you on your balcony
the other night, Mr. Tolliver,

30:16.690 --> 30:19.692
taking in the life of the camp, I thought
maybe it was time we had a talk.

30:19.860 --> 30:23.446
I regret we have to meet
in this environment, sir.

30:23.614 --> 30:25.490
- Not at all.
- No.

30:25.657 --> 30:29.911
Changes that have gone on here,
it's not the place I'd be seen in by you.

30:30.078 --> 30:34.332
I'm sure whatever changes you allude to
will come clear from your behavior.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.959
Fresh start.
(chuckles)

30:37.127 --> 30:40.713
How many men would
be grateful for that opportunity?

30:40.881 --> 30:44.217
Do you have more you wish to do with that,
or shall I state my business?

30:44.384 --> 30:46.135
Please, state your business.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.554
Your letter from Mr. Wolcott

30:48.722 --> 30:51.599
naming me as having knowledge
of his misdeeds.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.976
A letter I mentioned to you,

30:54.144 --> 30:56.729
yes, in a conversation I regret.

30:56.897 --> 31:01.901
5% of my holdings I recall as your demand
or you would circulate the letter's contents.

31:02.069 --> 31:04.904
Exactly what I regret
and now find reprehensible.

31:05.072 --> 31:08.574
And why I thank God
that you take a new look at me.

31:08.742 --> 31:12.453
To this point, Mr. Tolliver, you make
no materially different impression.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.247
Still lying, still bullshitting.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.249
I hope I'm not, sir, but I--

31:16.416 --> 31:21.337
I can certainly understand why that would be
your material second impression.

31:21.505 --> 31:25.174
Shall I show you the letter from Mr. Wolcott
that I have in my possession?

31:25.342 --> 31:27.593
That's not necessary
from my point of view.

31:27.761 --> 31:30.096
You tell me you've got it,
I believe you.

31:30.264 --> 31:33.349
Here it is. Will you compare it
to your letter?

31:33.517 --> 31:36.561
- Verify its authenticity?
- It's not necessary.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.272
Shall I read to you certain
pertinent sections

31:39.439 --> 31:41.941
on Wolcott's assay of your nature

31:42.109 --> 31:44.443
and likely behavior after his death?

31:44.611 --> 31:49.323
His detailing your complicitous participation
in the aftermath of his crimes--

31:49.491 --> 31:51.909
disposing of the bodies and so forth?

31:52.077 --> 31:55.788
You have no letter
from Wolcott, Mr. Tolliver.

31:55.956 --> 31:58.749
(inhales)

31:59.751 --> 32:01.877
Let's say that's the case.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.046
I just did. Let's hear you say it.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.508
I have no letter from Mr. Wolcott.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.635
- Never did.
- I never did have one.

32:09.803 --> 32:12.638
You're a lying, blackmailing sack of shit.

32:12.806 --> 32:15.099
What do you want?

32:15.267 --> 32:18.519
I want you to go to work for me.

32:24.109 --> 32:26.319
(clears throat)
How was your walk?

32:27.571 --> 32:29.739
I seemed to get around adequately.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.741
Seemed to get along with that dandy.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.909
Yeah, he's all right.

32:35.412 --> 32:37.246
Theater fella, huh?

32:37.414 --> 32:39.373
Langrishe?

32:41.293 --> 32:44.920
He's a fucking promoter of the first
fucking quality, I can tell you that.

32:45.088 --> 32:48.924
I don't go to plays so I can't speak
to his worth as an actor.

32:50.427 --> 32:52.261
Ahh-- Tuesdays...

32:52.429 --> 32:54.680
he'll tend to have amateur nights.

32:54.848 --> 32:57.725
Been to plenty of those.
Virginia City--

32:57.893 --> 33:01.604
guy farted seemed near an hour.

33:01.772 --> 33:03.939
Well, that don't sound like no amateur.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.400
(laughs)

33:06.568 --> 33:08.694
- Bullock.
- Tell that Chinaman

33:08.862 --> 33:12.823
when I want admission to his meat locker,
it behooves him to fucking cooperate.

33:12.991 --> 33:16.410
- What did he do instead?
- Said "Swedgin" and barred my way.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.537
Had you eyes to select your own cut?

33:18.705 --> 33:21.082
Are you gonna fuck with me?

33:21.249 --> 33:23.876
I had eyes for the Cornishman
killed in here last week.

33:24.044 --> 33:27.254
I explained it to him,
and he goddamn understood me.

33:27.422 --> 33:31.175
Did he mosey over to a corner,
lift up a fucking tarp?

33:32.636 --> 33:33.969
Yeah, he went to the tarp.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.971
That's what the croaker was under.

33:36.139 --> 33:39.725
That's our nook in Wu's structure.

33:41.478 --> 33:43.729
Why Wu delayed cooperating,

33:43.897 --> 33:46.565
he hadn't known the croaker
was under there.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.402
His stupid suit so overcome me

33:49.569 --> 33:52.530
it slipped my mind to tell him.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.699
I want that body.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.368
I'll see Wu hands it over.

34:00.914 --> 34:04.667
Hearst just had another Cornish killed
at his diggings for trying to organize.

34:04.835 --> 34:07.002
They're calling that one an accident.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.004
What makes you think any good

34:09.172 --> 34:11.340
will come of confronting Hearst now?

34:11.507 --> 34:13.300
Now is when he's killing people.

34:13.467 --> 34:16.929
- What, you feel he'll leave off soon?
- Tactics and timing ain't the issue.

34:17.097 --> 34:19.473
The hell you say.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.438
If his pigs get that body,

34:25.605 --> 34:27.898
Wu is their next fucking meal.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.775
You make him understand.

35:04.895 --> 35:07.354
Chez Amis.

35:07.522 --> 35:11.066
Cooperage.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.402
I'm watering these
kids' vegetables.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.488
We don't do the other anymore.

35:15.655 --> 35:17.740
Very good.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.118
Lovely building.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.913
- Sturdy?
- Get away now.

35:35.342 --> 35:38.677
I apologize for
the awkwardness

35:38.845 --> 35:41.388
between you and my husband.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.600
My dear Phoebe-- Mrs. Hearst--
like your Mr. Ellsworth,

35:44.768 --> 35:47.728
while pleasantly conversable
on most subjects,

35:47.896 --> 35:51.482
finds others not to suit her at all.

36:01.243 --> 36:03.202
Will you hear my offer, Mr. Hearst?

36:03.370 --> 36:05.162
Of course.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.627
I am willing to sell to you

36:11.795 --> 36:14.380
a 49% ownership in my claim,

36:14.548 --> 36:17.132
in return for-- and here,

36:17.300 --> 36:19.301
of course, I am out of my depth--

36:19.469 --> 36:22.555
but for the sake of
beginning a negotiation,

36:22.722 --> 36:26.225
- I'll say 5% of your holdings in the Hills?
- (exhales)

36:26.393 --> 36:28.811
You would have an easement
through my holdings

36:28.979 --> 36:31.939
for the transport of your ore,
unqualified in any regard

36:32.107 --> 36:34.984
except that it not
impede my mining operation.

36:35.151 --> 36:37.152
Naturally, at a separate fee,

36:37.320 --> 36:41.991
I would wish access to transport
for my own ore.

36:42.158 --> 36:44.410
Have you finished?

36:44.578 --> 36:47.162
I have, yes.

36:47.330 --> 36:50.457
Your proposal is thoughtful,

36:50.625 --> 36:54.253
but I'm afraid I lack the qualities

36:54.421 --> 36:57.089
that minority participations require.

36:57.257 --> 37:00.843
As I said, these are
the most preliminary thoughts--

37:01.011 --> 37:04.471
A vulgar man would ask
before preceding any further

37:04.639 --> 37:07.474
if you would require him
to produce his jackknife

37:07.642 --> 37:10.102
and make himself a capon before you.

37:12.939 --> 37:15.065
What in my ideas

37:15.233 --> 37:17.234
do you find emasculating?

37:17.402 --> 37:19.862
I can offer no inside explanations,

37:20.030 --> 37:22.489
Mrs. Ellsworth, as I am not a capon,

37:22.657 --> 37:25.743
which details offend me and why.

37:25.911 --> 37:28.829
Your proposal offends completely.

37:28.997 --> 37:32.917
It mistakes my nature absolutely.

37:36.713 --> 37:38.547
All right.

37:38.715 --> 37:40.716
Will you hear my counterproposal?

37:40.884 --> 37:43.719
- I think not, sir.
- Do hear it, Mrs. Ellsworth.

37:43.887 --> 37:46.180
Let me name an amount to buy you out.

37:46.348 --> 37:49.016
I will not hear it, Mr. Hearst.

37:50.477 --> 37:52.728
Let me out.

37:52.896 --> 37:54.813
Shall I scream?

37:54.981 --> 37:58.859
The hour makes
the thoroughfare uncertain.

37:59.027 --> 38:00.986
Will you have an escort

38:01.154 --> 38:04.323
until your dear home's lights
appear before you?

38:04.491 --> 38:06.909
No.

38:09.663 --> 38:11.872
(whispering)
You are reckless, madam.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.166
(inhales)

38:15.585 --> 38:18.128
You indulge yourself.

38:41.611 --> 38:44.154
Stand your watch.
I'll-- I'll get this part later.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.619
Everything fixed to your liking, folks?

39:32.787 --> 39:34.621
Wonderful. Thank you.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.290
Have you supped
sumptuously?

39:36.458 --> 39:39.168
- Actually, we have.
- I'm delighted. Countess?

39:39.335 --> 39:42.671
- Costumes were damp.
- Oh dear. Are you drying them?

39:42.839 --> 39:44.548
You are, of course.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.925
I am tedious beyond bearing to ask.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.094
A newly rakish tilt?

39:50.305 --> 39:53.432
Cheyenne and Black Hills
Telegraph Company.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.267
Telegram for Mr....

39:55.435 --> 39:57.561
"Langinshire."

39:57.729 --> 39:59.688
- Langrishe!
- Langrishe.

39:59.856 --> 40:02.191
I am he.

40:02.358 --> 40:03.901
- Telegram.
- Yes.

40:10.992 --> 40:13.327
Wait.

40:17.707 --> 40:21.335
- Thank you.
- Very welcome.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.337
(sighs)

40:24.506 --> 40:26.423
What did you give?

40:26.591 --> 40:28.467
- A dollar.
- Too much.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.845
Chesterton and Bellegarde
are in transit from Cheyenne.

40:32.013 --> 40:34.640
Having "suffered
the tortures of the damned"?

40:34.808 --> 40:37.643
"Endured indescribable
inconvenience."

40:37.811 --> 40:41.146
- "The damned" was from Fort Kearney.
- (laughs)

40:41.314 --> 40:43.315
I shall take the air.

40:43.483 --> 40:45.400
Shall I accompany you?

40:45.568 --> 40:47.611
My destination is beneath you.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.571
At least something would be.

40:49.739 --> 40:52.074
Good evening.

40:52.242 --> 40:53.992
Good evening.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.578
- Madam.
- Sir.

40:58.748 --> 41:01.166
Wonderful food!

41:03.378 --> 41:05.504
We got fish and we got ham,

41:05.672 --> 41:07.798
and don't pay no attention to the menu.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.851
The thought I'd put into it,

41:19.018 --> 41:21.854
all the time I took to write it out

41:22.021 --> 41:25.023
and put it by and look again.
(sighs)

41:25.191 --> 41:28.026
I began to read to him my proposal,

41:28.194 --> 41:30.362
but I was more and more afraid

41:30.530 --> 41:32.865
I was only chanting sounds.

41:33.032 --> 41:34.992
Finally, I made myself

41:35.160 --> 41:37.786
look to him to confirm that I was

41:37.954 --> 41:40.414
speaking intelligently
and being understood.

41:40.582 --> 41:42.541
Now you know.

41:44.210 --> 41:47.713
He grinned at me like a jackal.

41:49.382 --> 41:51.175
This is what I would have spared you.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.677
He scorned my offer.

41:53.845 --> 41:58.307
He said I mistook
his nature absolutely.

41:58.474 --> 42:01.059
- You did.
- Yes.

42:01.227 --> 42:03.979
And was there more?

42:04.147 --> 42:06.398
After the jackal smiled?

42:06.566 --> 42:09.276
It seemed very possible that

42:09.444 --> 42:11.695
there could be,
but finally he let me go.

42:11.863 --> 42:14.281
He had restrained you?

42:14.449 --> 42:17.618
(sniffles)
I was very afraid.

42:17.785 --> 42:21.163
I can't say with any certainty
exactly what was happening.

42:22.749 --> 42:24.625
What the hell do you mean?

42:24.792 --> 42:27.252
Did you try to leave,
and did he prevent you?

42:27.420 --> 42:30.923
Don't use that tone of voice with me.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.259
Well, I guess I know
what that means.

42:34.427 --> 42:36.386
Oh, do you, Mr. Ellsworth?

42:36.554 --> 42:39.765
That you're a goddamn fool
who almost got what she deserved.

42:39.933 --> 42:42.226
And what would that have been?

42:42.393 --> 42:46.021
And why would I have deserved it?

42:52.237 --> 42:54.655
I only wanted to protect you.

42:54.822 --> 42:57.491
You can't.

43:04.207 --> 43:06.333
Mmm.

43:06.501 --> 43:08.877
I wish you'd eat that
outside, Mr. Hearst.

43:10.046 --> 43:13.882
- I wanted to be sure you have all you need.
- And more besides.

43:14.050 --> 43:16.218
And now you done
seen for yourself.

43:16.386 --> 43:18.929
I really don't care what
others think of me, Aunt Lou.

43:19.097 --> 43:21.598
And you need only care what I think.

43:21.766 --> 43:25.269
God, I hate these camps--
all this deferring and adjusting

43:25.436 --> 43:27.646
to others' wrong-headed stupidities.

43:27.814 --> 43:30.607
I must have missed where they
was better in San Francisco.

43:30.775 --> 43:32.859
They're not. They're worse.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.861
Can't bear San Francisco.

43:35.029 --> 43:37.114
Don't let Mrs. Hearst
hear you saying that.

43:37.282 --> 43:40.033
Aw, she knows, she knows.

43:40.201 --> 43:42.828
She knows why
I always leave so quickly.

43:44.497 --> 43:47.624
Goddamn truth is I'd rather
be off by myself, Aunt Lou,

43:47.792 --> 43:49.793
free to do my work.

43:51.671 --> 43:53.338
Boy-the-Earth-Talks-To.

43:53.506 --> 43:56.341
- That's your Indian name.
- That's right. You remember.

43:57.385 --> 44:00.512
That's the only goddamn conversation
I care to have,

44:00.680 --> 44:03.807
her telling me where to dig into her.

44:09.814 --> 44:11.315
Wonderful.

44:11.482 --> 44:13.608
Thank you, sir.

44:22.285 --> 44:26.330
I haven't ate potatoes
quite that smooth.

44:26.497 --> 44:30.042
I don't know if I ever
had 'em that smooth. (chuckles)

44:32.712 --> 44:35.172
These elections can't be a joke.

44:37.175 --> 44:39.384
More tail-chasing for him
to laugh at us about.

44:39.552 --> 44:40.969
Hearst?

44:41.137 --> 44:43.805
The offices have
to count for something.

44:47.852 --> 44:50.604
How will you work that?

44:53.733 --> 44:55.942
- Laws.
- Jesus Christ!

44:56.110 --> 44:57.986
Excuse me.

44:58.154 --> 45:01.823
Seems like one way more
for his kind to run us...

45:01.991 --> 45:04.576
laws do.

45:10.917 --> 45:13.043
Who will have strawberries?

45:17.382 --> 45:19.883
Cy: I hope you'll
take it as measure

45:20.051 --> 45:22.386
of my keenness, sir, and curiosity.

45:22.553 --> 45:24.388
Yes yes yes, Mr. Tolliver.

45:24.555 --> 45:27.265
You wish to know
your duties in my service.

45:27.433 --> 45:30.977
Well, I make my way through
the muck to learn the details.

45:31.145 --> 45:33.355
Your duties will be to answer

45:33.523 --> 45:35.315
like a dog when I call.

45:35.483 --> 45:37.025
Like a dog?

45:37.193 --> 45:39.277
Complications of intention

45:39.445 --> 45:41.321
on your part in dealings with me

45:41.489 --> 45:43.949
or duplicity or indirection--

45:44.117 --> 45:46.618
behavior, in short,
which displeases me

45:46.786 --> 45:49.246
will bring you
a smack on the snout.

45:49.414 --> 45:50.997
Ouch.

45:51.165 --> 45:54.543
When administered by
a practiced hand, such a blow can be

45:54.710 --> 45:57.504
more painful and grievous even

45:57.672 --> 46:00.590
than your recent sufferings.

46:00.758 --> 46:04.052
I don't doubt the hand
would be practiced.

46:04.220 --> 46:07.139
Mr. Swearengen recently
discovered as much.

46:08.599 --> 46:11.560
I gather it cost him a finger.

46:13.312 --> 46:15.480
But I should say too

46:15.648 --> 46:19.109
that in these rooms
just this afternoon

46:19.277 --> 46:22.195
such displeasure brought me
near to murdering the sheriff

46:22.363 --> 46:25.490
and raping Mrs. Ellsworth.

46:26.742 --> 46:29.536
I have learned through
time, Mr. Tolliver,

46:29.704 --> 46:31.955
and as repeatedly seem to forget

46:32.123 --> 46:34.791
that whatever temporary comfort

46:34.959 --> 46:38.086
relieving my displeasure brings me,

46:38.254 --> 46:41.840
my long-term interests suffer.

46:42.008 --> 46:44.468
My proper traffic is with the earth.

46:44.635 --> 46:48.680
In my dealings with people

46:48.848 --> 46:51.600
I ought solely have to do with niggers

46:51.767 --> 46:55.020
and whites who obey me like dogs.

46:56.981 --> 46:59.858
If he hadn't meant me to wag it, sir,

47:00.026 --> 47:03.278
why would the Lord give me a tail?

47:06.991 --> 47:09.868
Aunt Lou: So I make you
my second deputy,

47:10.036 --> 47:13.663
you clever little
heathen monkey tongue.

47:15.374 --> 47:18.001
(laughs)

47:18.169 --> 47:21.671
You stand there, Richardson.
You're lucky for Aunt Lou.

47:21.839 --> 47:23.715
(men speak Chinese)

47:23.883 --> 47:26.009
Aunt Lou: Don't shy away
from a little noise now.

47:26.177 --> 47:28.011
(speaking Chinese)

47:28.179 --> 47:29.930
See, I speak your stuff.

47:30.097 --> 47:33.225
You savvy? Clatter them
goddamn sparrows.

47:33.392 --> 47:37.395
"I love your cobbler like sunset, Lou,"

47:37.563 --> 47:39.689
and back-broke niggers in the fields.

47:39.857 --> 47:41.650
(snickers)
George Hearst?

47:41.817 --> 47:44.236
He do love his nose in a hole more,

47:44.403 --> 47:47.405
and ass in the air
and back legs kickin' out

47:47.573 --> 47:49.991
little lumps of gold
like a fucking badger.

47:50.159 --> 47:51.993
No more use
for them nuggets either,

47:52.161 --> 47:53.703
past counting them up

47:53.871 --> 47:56.540
and saying that big number
to astonish niggers

47:56.707 --> 47:58.750
to remind us we in the world.

48:00.127 --> 48:01.628
Hah!

48:01.796 --> 48:04.005
I seem to have won.

48:04.173 --> 48:07.092
That's the 13 orphans natural.

48:07.260 --> 48:10.971
(laughs) Shall we clatter them
motherfuckers again?

48:11.138 --> 48:12.639
(laughs)

48:15.351 --> 48:18.979
Strange affectations
your devil friend has--

48:19.146 --> 48:21.314
shabby appearance, derelict hotel.

48:21.482 --> 48:24.859
Al: Put the hole through that wall
just before he worked on my hand.

48:25.027 --> 48:26.611
Americans...

48:26.779 --> 48:29.614
it never occurs to them
to try the window.

48:31.492 --> 48:33.952
I'll tell you the truth.

48:35.538 --> 48:38.498
I begin to wonder if I mightn't
be fucking queer.

48:38.666 --> 48:41.960
You see more to admire
in the male asshole than you'd...

48:42.128 --> 48:43.795
realized hitherto?

48:43.963 --> 48:47.048
That I haven't gone yet
for Hearst's throat.

48:47.216 --> 48:50.802
Ambition and the blessed
simplicities of action

48:50.970 --> 48:52.971
don't always quarter in comfort.

48:53.139 --> 48:55.974
I've no fucking ambition
past trading

48:56.142 --> 48:58.810
to my favor and coming--

48:58.978 --> 49:00.812
once a day.

49:00.980 --> 49:02.814
Bullshit!

49:02.982 --> 49:05.150
A thing of this order

49:05.318 --> 49:09.487
you'd as soon not see ruined
or in cinders.

49:10.698 --> 49:12.949
I will if I fucking have to.

49:13.117 --> 49:17.704
Avoiding it if I could.

49:23.878 --> 49:25.712
Good night, Al.

49:25.880 --> 49:28.381
Good night.

49:29.675 --> 49:32.636
Few enough I find tolerable.

49:33.929 --> 49:36.765
Lucky our paths
have crossed again.

49:38.643 --> 49:40.518
Don't misinterpret that.

49:42.605 --> 49:44.814
All right, Jack.
