all because of my mutation.

13:44.622 --> 13:45.856
Forgive me.

13:45.923 --> 13:47.925
Now that you understand
the importance...

13:47.993 --> 13:49.826
of controlling
the mutant within you,

13:49.894 --> 13:52.395
your training
can truly begin.

13:56.034 --> 13:57.935
[ All Groaning ]
Man.

13:58.003 --> 14:02.439
[ Moans ]
Oh, man. What happened?
Was that a dream?

14:02.507 --> 14:06.643
I remember seeing
this hideously
ugly creature.

14:06.711 --> 14:09.180
That was you, dude.
No, it was you.

14:09.248 --> 14:13.717
It was all of us.
We mutated... but only
for a few minutes.

14:13.785 --> 14:17.454
Whatever happened,
that Medusa's evaporated.

14:17.522 --> 14:20.758
Yeah, but she's still
got Leonardo. Come on!

14:23.728 --> 14:25.729
We have boarded
the space station,
Lord Dregg.

14:25.797 --> 14:28.232
Preparing to install
the stasis relay.

14:28.300 --> 14:33.304
<i>And the moment it's installed,</i>
<i>world domination at last.</i>

14:34.940 --> 14:37.407
[ Donatello ]
I'm picking up some
weird energy readings.

14:37.475 --> 14:39.476
Almost too weird.
[ Beeping ]

14:39.544 --> 14:41.512
So, it's probably
Medusa's ship.

14:41.579 --> 14:44.748
Yeah, but someone
as advanced as Medusa
wouldn't be this sloppy--

14:44.816 --> 14:47.518
unless she wanted us
to find her!

14:47.585 --> 14:49.720
Translation: a trap.

14:49.788 --> 14:53.290
What choice have we got, dudes?
We gotta find Leonardo.

14:53.358 --> 14:57.027
[ Communicator Chirps ]

What now, April?

14:57.094 --> 14:59.463
<i>Raphael, have you heard</i>
<i>of SkySat?</i>

14:59.531 --> 15:02.733
You mean that big space station
they had to shut down?
Yeah. What about it?

15:02.801 --> 15:06.537
The space agency just
turned it over to Dregg
for repairs.

15:06.604 --> 15:09.039
Now, what would Dregg want
with a space station?

15:09.107 --> 15:11.042
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>but it can't be good.</i>

15:11.109 --> 15:14.511
[ Donatello ]
Well, it'll have to wait.
We've got bigger problems.

15:14.579 --> 15:17.714
The signals were emitting
from somewhere around here.

15:20.952 --> 15:23.821
We're gonna
have to split up
and search the place.

15:26.491 --> 15:27.791
[ Beeps ]

15:27.859 --> 15:30.560
Raphael!
Carter!

15:30.628 --> 15:33.563
You came back!
And wait till you see
what I found.

15:38.870 --> 15:42.039
[ Grunting ]
Going somewhere?

15:44.376 --> 15:46.610
Michelangelo.
Leonardo!

15:46.678 --> 15:49.780
How'd you get away
from Medusa?
This way. I'll show you.

15:49.847 --> 15:52.449
Dude, you are truly--

15:53.451 --> 15:55.119
gone!
[ Gasps ]

15:56.687 --> 16:00.157
Donatello!
Carter.
What are you doing here?

16:00.225 --> 16:03.193
The guys need your help.
Hey, wait a minute.

16:03.261 --> 16:06.997
If the guys need my help,
why didn't they call me
on the Turtle-com?

16:08.366 --> 16:10.167
Just as I thought.

16:10.235 --> 16:13.304
The virtual reality projector.

16:13.371 --> 16:17.708
Okay, Medusa!
Your little game's over.
Come on out!

16:17.775 --> 16:19.309
As you wish.

16:19.377 --> 16:22.646
Ah, I should have kept
my big beak shut.

16:30.488 --> 16:32.656
[ Shouts ]

16:35.560 --> 16:37.227
[ Beeping ]

16:37.295 --> 16:40.297
Do not fight
your emotions.
Accept them.

16:40.365 --> 16:43.700
In this way, you become
the master of yourself.

16:43.768 --> 16:45.435
[ Communicator Chirps ]

16:45.503 --> 16:47.270
Guys, come in!

16:47.338 --> 16:49.473
<i>[ Lasers Blasting ]</i>
Sounds like a battle.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.876
<i>[ Donatello ]</i>
<i>You may have caught me,</i>
<i>but the others will get you.</i>

16:52.944 --> 16:56.546
<i>[ Medusa ]</i>
<i>Your friends are all captured.</i>
<i>No one can help you, Turtle.</i>

16:56.615 --> 16:58.348
It's Donatello!

16:58.416 --> 17:01.618
The time has come
to put your training
to the test, Carter.

17:01.686 --> 17:04.521
Sensei, I am ready.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.457
I think.

17:07.525 --> 17:11.428
Remember, my boy,
always concentrate
on the task at hand.

17:11.496 --> 17:14.130
Let nothing else
enter your mind.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.401
I won't forget, Sensei.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.471
[ Motorcycle Roaring ]

17:23.508 --> 17:26.443
The homing device on the guys'
com should lead me to them.
[ Beeping ]

17:39.524 --> 17:43.794
The stasis relay is installed
in the main transmitting
antenna, Lord Dregg.

17:43.862 --> 17:46.196
<i>Excellent.</i>
<i>Activate it at once.</i>

17:56.040 --> 17:57.774
<i>[ Electrical Crackling ]</i>

17:57.842 --> 18:02.045
Computer lines,

everything just went dead.

Then the defense systems
of the world...

18:04.549 --> 18:07.050
are completely
nonfunctional.

18:13.458 --> 18:16.526

The signals are coming
from in there.

18:21.799 --> 18:23.400
Medusa's ship!

Now to sell those mutants
to the Galactic Force

18:27.672 --> 18:30.240
for a tidy profit.

18:30.307 --> 18:32.509
This tub's about
to take off!

18:32.577 --> 18:36.580
[ Grunts ]
I gotta get inside
somehow.

18:36.647 --> 18:40.650
Concentrate
on the task at hand,
like Splinter said.

18:40.718 --> 18:43.354
[ Grunts ]
Must have control.

18:43.421 --> 18:45.256
[ Grunts ]
Concentrate!

18:45.323 --> 18:50.627
Well, dudes, I guess
we're gonna be space miners
for the rest of our lives.

Only a miracle
could save us now.

18:58.803 --> 19:00.738
[ Leonardo ]

Whoa! Weird place
for a phone booth.

Wait. This isn't
a phone booth.
It's a teleporter!

19:30.868 --> 19:33.304
Guys, if you can
keep Medusa busy...

19:33.371 --> 19:35.806
long enough for me to get to
the virtual reality projector,

19:35.873 --> 19:38.175
we can get rid of her
for keeps!

- Goin' somewhere, lady?
- Filthy mutants!

Very well.

Hey, nice goin', Donatello.
Where'd you send her?

Ah, somewhere
on the other side
of the galaxy.

be buggin' us again.

- Hey, Carter, are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:36.167 --> 20:38.468
But all that concentrating
really wiped me out.

We'd better
check in with April
on the SkySat situation.

20:41.739 --> 20:45.942

- Someone must be jamming
the transmission.

<i>and stop the disruption!</i>

Yeah. Dregg's got control
of every defense system
