WEBVTT

00:07.924 --> 00:11.302
Man:
The T-shirt was found
with the body.

00:11.386 --> 00:15.056
And there's bleach,
which means there was
an attempt at a cover-up,

00:15.140 --> 00:16.683
along with
blood and paint.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.601
Maybe to wipe it
off the wall?

00:18.685 --> 00:20.770
Yeah, until they realized
it was futile.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.063
Then they just
threw it in that tarp

00:22.147 --> 00:23.815
that we found the body
rolled up in.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.567
And what about
the blood on it?

00:25.650 --> 00:28.194
Yeah, I think it's hers.
We're gonna run tests.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.905
We're gonna do a full
DNA spectrum on the shirt.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.867
And there's this.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.620
I have no idea
what it is.

00:37.704 --> 00:41.249
It was found jammed
into a fold of skin
in the lower abdomen.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.002
Secondary
murder weapon?

00:44.085 --> 00:46.921
Nah, it was just--
it's thin plastic.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.757
Um, it could've
been used

00:48.840 --> 00:51.176
to jam the body down
in the hole we found it in,

00:51.259 --> 00:52.802
or it could be nothing.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.180
- Did you photograph these?
- Yeah, I'll email them to you.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.724
- Thank you.
- All right.

00:57.807 --> 01:00.894
You know,
if you want my opinion,

01:00.977 --> 01:03.646
I think this whole thing
started out as an accident.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.106
Yeah.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.026
A fall--
that's an accident--

01:08.109 --> 01:10.111
a punch--
less of an accident--

01:10.195 --> 01:12.947
and then there is
what I would like to call

01:13.031 --> 01:17.786
a whole list
of unprofessional
concussive events.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.287
I'm sorry,
unprofessional?

01:19.370 --> 01:20.413
Oh, yeah.

01:20.497 --> 01:23.124
Smack here,
failed choking attempt.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.753
Oh, and then a more final,
more conclusive concussive event

01:26.836 --> 01:28.463
to the left side
of the face and head.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.465
Indicating a right-handed
person, right?

01:30.548 --> 01:33.802
- Yeah, between
180 and 220.
- ( laughs )

01:33.885 --> 01:36.179
It's always amazing to me
how you can figure that out.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.223
And an existentialist
and a Gemini.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.433
- Sorry, what?
- I just made that up.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.268
( chuckles )
Mike.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.063
What the eff?

01:45.146 --> 01:46.773
What,
you didn't hear?

01:46.856 --> 01:48.107
Nate:
<i>No.</i>

01:48.191 --> 01:49.734
Mike:
<i>20 minutes ago,</i>

01:49.818 --> 01:52.362
<i>this guy comes completely</i>
<i>out of the woodwork.</i>

01:52.445 --> 01:54.489
<i>Says he used to be partners</i>
<i>with Eric Neill.</i>

01:54.572 --> 01:57.242
<i>Oh, yeah, tied him</i>
<i>to a whole bunch of cases</i>
<i>in the past.</i>

01:57.325 --> 01:58.910
Like grifter stuff.

01:58.993 --> 02:02.163
Yeah, there was, like,
a retarded girl with
a huge trust fund.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.916
Same MO
as the Olivia Lake
murder case.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.584
This is bull.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.045
( chuckling )
Oh, no, no, he had
some good stories.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.588
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.549
It's bull that
this is happening now.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.676
Nothing just comes
out of the blue.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.935
- Nate? Hey, Natey.
- Hi. Hon, this is not
a good time.

02:24.018 --> 02:25.562
There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.729
I've been thinking...

02:26.813 --> 02:29.023
Seriously, they just
dragged someone

02:29.107 --> 02:30.775
out of the woodwork
for me to deal with now.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.652
- Nate.
- What?

02:32.735 --> 02:34.654
That's what
this is about.

02:34.737 --> 02:37.323
I saw it.
Someone is playing dirty.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.033
I know, I know.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.535
Someone wants me
off the Joel trail

02:40.618 --> 02:42.412
and back onto
the Eric trail...

02:42.495 --> 02:44.330
Okay, well,
this is my thought.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.708
If you wanted,
do the same.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.586
What?

02:49.669 --> 02:51.588
Leak something,
chum the waters.

02:51.671 --> 02:52.922
- No!
- See what Joel does.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.674
I'm never
gonna do that!

02:56.217 --> 02:57.927
( whispers )
That is--

02:58.011 --> 02:59.470
it's unethical.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.598
It's dishonest
and it's bad police work.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.516
Unless it proves
you're right.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.061
Then behind every door upstairs
they're gonna be calling you
a genius.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.856
No, sorry,
that's not gonna happen.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.859
Let them bang pans
and flash lights
all over Eric.

03:12.942 --> 03:14.986
Thank you for the suggestion,
which I'm very surprised at,

03:15.069 --> 03:16.362
but I'm not
gonna do that.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.281
I love you,
but I'm not gonna do that.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.619
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.804
- ( chatter )
- Reporter: Oh, there he is!

03:41.888 --> 03:45.058
Detective Henry,
your thoughts on
Casey Delacroix.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.143
Who is he and why is this
coming out now?

03:47.226 --> 03:50.313
Nate:
I have no comment
on an ongoing investigation.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.940
- Excuse me.
- Reporter #2: So it is
an investigation?

03:52.023 --> 03:53.650
- No.
- Has it been reopened?

03:53.733 --> 03:55.443
- Pete.
- Does Casey Delacroix
raise doubts

03:55.526 --> 03:57.612
or confirm your feelings
about Eric Neill?

03:57.695 --> 03:59.030
Pete, nothing has changed.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.615
In fact,
I ask all of you

04:00.698 --> 04:03.159
to respect the memory
of the victim, Olivia Lake.

04:03.242 --> 04:05.536
Detective, you were part
of the investigation
four years ago.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.996
Are you reopening
this case?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.957
Let me restate,
I am not reopening the case.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.625
We're hearing that
Eric Neill has

04:10.708 --> 04:13.836
a similar criminal history
to that of the case
of Olivia Lake.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.381
Eric Neill's previous record
has nothing to do with
the current situation.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.549
- Pete: What's your plan
now going forward?
- Guys, come on!

04:18.633 --> 04:20.093
The story
is not about me.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.928
In fact,
there is no story.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.346
- I have nothing to say.
- Woman: Has the body...

04:23.429 --> 04:24.931
This is not
about me, guys.

04:25.014 --> 04:27.600
- ( reporters clamoring )
- Come on. Come on, guys!

04:27.684 --> 04:29.435
Come on, Pete,
seriously!

04:29.519 --> 04:32.522
You know me.
You know that I don't
talk to the press,

04:32.605 --> 04:34.315
even when there is
something to say.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.651
I have no comment.
Please. Thank you.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.778
( clamoring )

04:38.861 --> 04:40.238
I'll run you over.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.614
Detective!

04:41.698 --> 04:43.950
...but when
you are through
up on the hill,

04:44.033 --> 04:46.536
call me, period.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.872
I have a question
about Alan, period.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.041
Won't take long,
period.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.590
Hey, Joel.
Just checking in.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.300
Give a call
when you... can.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.803
<i>( chatter )</i>

05:15.398 --> 05:17.275
( muted audio )

05:25.575 --> 05:27.827
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

05:30.204 --> 05:32.123
- Hello?
- Automated voice:
<i>To accept a collect call</i>

05:32.206 --> 05:34.292
<i>from the Utah</i>
<i>Department of Corrections,</i>

05:34.375 --> 05:36.044
<i>please press 1.</i>

05:36.127 --> 05:37.253
<i>To know...</i>

05:40.298 --> 05:42.592
- Hello?
- Pet, it's bullshit.
Somebody's paying him to talk.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.761
I know him.
He wouldn't talk unless
someone was paying him.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.929
- Are you there? Petra?
-<i> What's going on?</i>

05:47.013 --> 05:50.433
Okay, him and me
worked together,
but only a few times.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.935
He doesn't know me,

05:53.019 --> 05:55.146
<i>and nothing he's saying</i>
<i>can be trusted.</i>

05:55.229 --> 05:56.731
Petra:
<i>Who is Eloise Brand?</i>

05:56.814 --> 05:59.192
Eric:
<i>This trust fund girl</i>
<i>Casey knew</i>

05:59.275 --> 06:01.694
from some boarding school
where he worked.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.738
It was 12 years ago,

06:03.821 --> 06:06.908
and she was
totally messed up and--

06:06.991 --> 06:08.910
<i>She fell in love with you,</i>
<i>she put you into her will,</i>

06:08.993 --> 06:10.286
<i>and then she died</i>
<i>like Olivia.</i>

06:10.369 --> 06:11.871
No, not like Olivia,

06:11.954 --> 06:13.873
and not
till six months after,
and she OD'd.

06:13.956 --> 06:17.335
And not only did
nobody press charges,
there never were charges,

06:17.418 --> 06:20.296
'cause nobody ever
even once suspected me
of anything ever.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.298
<i>Why am I finding out now?</i>

06:22.381 --> 06:25.134
- 'Cause I didn't think
it was anything.
-<i> Eric.</i>

06:25.218 --> 06:27.053
I didn't wanna lose you, Pet.
You're all I have.

06:27.136 --> 06:29.430
You're the only one
who's ever believed me,

06:29.514 --> 06:30.932
believed in me.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.351
<i>What else don't I know?</i>

06:33.434 --> 06:35.645
I promise that is all.

06:35.728 --> 06:38.147
<i>That's all</i>
<i>you and Casey did?</i>

06:38.231 --> 06:40.900
That, which had
no charges,
and Olivia.

06:40.983 --> 06:43.152
And one other time

06:43.236 --> 06:45.446
a couple years
before Olivia,

06:45.530 --> 06:48.449
we had an idea to convince
all these Summit people

06:48.533 --> 06:51.285
<i>to fund this bullshit dig</i>
<i>for silver.</i>

06:51.369 --> 06:54.539
<i>Anyways, long story,</i>
<i>but we made a run</i>
<i>at a few people</i>

06:54.622 --> 06:55.957
<i>and none of them bought.</i>

06:56.040 --> 06:57.500
Wait, you were
in Summit before?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.418
<i>Yes, just to talk</i>
<i>to some people,</i>

06:59.502 --> 07:00.670
<i>but it went nowhere.</i>

07:00.753 --> 07:02.130
- Which people?
-<i> I don't know.</i>

07:02.213 --> 07:04.048
<i>A few down the hill,</i>
<i>a few up the hill.</i>

07:05.424 --> 07:06.717
The O'Connors?

07:06.801 --> 07:09.512
They were one, yes.
Why?

07:09.595 --> 07:11.264
Why? Pet, you there?
Why do you ask?

07:11.347 --> 07:13.015
<i>Is that</i>
<i>how you met Olivia?</i>

07:13.099 --> 07:15.601
I met Olivia through
an incoming call
a year later.

07:15.685 --> 07:19.230
-<i> From?</i>
- An attorney
named Cliff Jones.

07:19.313 --> 07:21.149
Cliff Jones?
Who the fuck is Cliff Jones?

07:21.232 --> 07:23.067
<i>He represented</i>
<i>some rich European lady</i>

07:23.151 --> 07:24.819
<i>who wanted to buy</i>
<i>Olivia's land,</i>

07:24.902 --> 07:26.904
<i>but Olivia</i>
<i>wouldn't sell it.</i>

07:26.988 --> 07:28.531
Okay, why?

07:28.614 --> 07:30.408
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>she was attached to it.</i>

07:30.491 --> 07:32.618
No, why did
he call you?

07:32.702 --> 07:34.078
<i>No idea.</i>

07:34.162 --> 07:36.330
You have no idea why
of all people he called you?

07:36.414 --> 07:38.124
<i>I didn't ask.</i>

07:38.207 --> 07:41.043
But you told your lawyer
about Cliff Jones?

07:41.127 --> 07:42.461
Of course I did.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.130
She said
he didn't exist.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.840
And anyways,
that doesn't matter for this.

07:45.923 --> 07:49.010
What matters for this
is whoever is paying Casey

07:49.093 --> 07:50.595
wants me to stay in here.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.805
And if you find
who's paying Casey,

07:52.889 --> 07:56.475
you will find the person
Olivia was talking about
on that call,

07:56.559 --> 07:58.686
- the person she was
actually afraid of.
-<i> ( phone beeps )</i>

07:58.769 --> 08:00.313
Shit, my time is up.
Come later.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.480
Come see me.
Shit!

08:05.943 --> 08:08.321
<i>( door opens )</i>

08:11.699 --> 08:13.075
Detective Henry.

08:23.085 --> 08:26.172
- I assume
that you got my--
- Duces tecum?

08:26.255 --> 08:27.590
Yeah.
Was it a joke?

08:27.673 --> 08:29.926
'Cause I found it
strikingly unfunny.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.886
I'm not sure
I understand.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.806
You're asking me
for a subpoena

08:35.890 --> 08:37.850
on a case
that's not only closed,

08:37.934 --> 08:40.978
but is, in fact,
solved...

08:41.062 --> 08:42.605
<i>because you're interested</i>
<i>in widening the search</i>

08:42.688 --> 08:44.315
<i>for someone who's</i>
<i>already been apprehended?</i>

08:44.398 --> 08:46.400
Look, all I'm trying
to do is my job--

08:46.484 --> 08:49.528
<i>I know.</i>
<i>Your former boss told me.</i>

08:49.612 --> 08:50.863
You're scratching
a four-year itch

08:50.947 --> 08:52.740
based on a hunch,
rooted in a feeling

08:52.823 --> 08:54.408
with the aid
of an associate who--

08:54.492 --> 08:56.077
let me see
if I get this right--

08:56.160 --> 09:00.831
is the sister of the person
who confessed to the crime.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.668
Well, the thing is

09:03.751 --> 09:05.962
Eric Neill
never confessed.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.380
Oh, come on, Detective.

09:07.463 --> 09:09.215
- Give me a break!
- It was an Alford plea.

09:09.298 --> 09:10.675
He never admitted guilt.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.468
I'm sorry,

09:12.551 --> 09:14.303
did I not see
some new state mandate

09:14.387 --> 09:16.847
requiring a law school
refresher course

09:16.931 --> 09:18.933
<i>on a decision</i>
<i>that I helped fashion...</i>

09:19.016 --> 09:20.810
- That's not what I--
-<i> ...which, if you really--</i>

09:20.893 --> 09:23.229
<i>if you really want me</i>
<i>to be honest, was too light</i>

09:23.312 --> 09:25.898
for a genuinely
dangerous individual.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.528
You might wanna trust me
on this, Detective.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.780
There are things
about him.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.782
<i>( sighs )</i>

09:34.865 --> 09:38.661
<i>So, here's what I have to say</i>
<i>about your subpoena.</i>

09:38.744 --> 09:40.204
<i>The next time</i>
<i>you come to my office</i>

09:40.288 --> 09:42.248
<i>for help on a case</i>
<i>that's actually active,</i>

09:42.331 --> 09:44.625
I want you to remember
this moment right here

09:44.709 --> 09:47.169
and the words coming
out of my mouth right now

09:47.253 --> 09:48.963
as the reason
why Dick Andreesen

09:49.046 --> 09:52.758
seemingly, inexplicably,
and certainly assholishly
said no.

09:54.927 --> 09:58.597
Good luck, Detective.
Please close the door
on your way out.

09:58.681 --> 10:02.018
- Okay.
-<i> Oh, and, Detective?</i>

10:02.101 --> 10:04.729
<i>Not really</i>
<i>any of my concern,</i>

10:04.812 --> 10:06.522
<i>but the choices you make,</i>

10:06.605 --> 10:08.899
the sides you pick...

10:10.234 --> 10:11.902
they have consequences.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.574
They sure do.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.828
Good day...<i> Dick.</i>

10:23.289 --> 10:24.749
You happy now?

10:26.375 --> 10:29.628
Actually, uh,
I'm angry now.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.006
A more appropriate response
would be fear.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.382
This is
a political town.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.551
I just got called in
to talk sense to you.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.887
Dick Andreesen
based his entire campaign

10:37.970 --> 10:39.889
on the successful conviction
of Eric Neill.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.808
- Speaking of political towns--
- What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

10:42.892 --> 10:45.061
It means check
your source, Alan.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.937
- He doesn't want us
re-examining any of this.
- The source?

10:47.021 --> 10:48.773
The source,
I'll remind you, was us.

10:48.856 --> 10:52.860
Dick Andreesen
and his whole team
went on what we supplied.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.236
No.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.654
They went on
what you supplied.

10:55.738 --> 10:59.116
-<i> We</i> supplied.
-<i> You</i> s...

10:59.200 --> 11:01.952
Okay, you were the one
who was racing to nail
Eric Neill.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.747
You were the one
who caved under pressure.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.374
What pressure, Alan?

11:06.457 --> 11:07.541
I have no idea.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.168
But let me
ask you this--

11:09.251 --> 11:11.462
who backed
your new business?

11:11.545 --> 11:14.799
- What are you suggesting?
- I don't know, man.

11:14.882 --> 11:17.009
- I hadn't honestly thought
about it till just now.
- Hey, hey, hey.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.886
No one backed
my business.

11:18.969 --> 11:21.263
I was hired because
my clients trust me.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.433
You were hired
by the same people
who backed Dick Andreesen.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.394
- How dare you?!
- At the same time,
by the way.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.396
Why? No idea.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.772
Are they connected?

11:29.855 --> 11:31.982
Honestly, I hadn't thought
about that one either,

11:32.066 --> 11:35.361
but why was everyone so fast
to convict Eric Neill?

11:35.444 --> 11:37.196
Because he committed
a murder.

11:37.279 --> 11:38.739
Maybe.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.783
You know what?
Probably.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.201
But I don't know,
though.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.911
Yeah, well,
you'd better know

11:43.994 --> 11:45.788
or else what I'm
witnessing right now

11:45.871 --> 11:49.375
is somebody very quickly
unraveling his career.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.919
My career is fine.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.546
Is it?

11:54.964 --> 11:56.340
Huh.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.008
I don't know.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.469
Maybe you're right.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.388
And in that case,
you know what,
I'll eat my words.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.723
But either way,
I better go find out,

12:04.807 --> 12:07.977
because my job,
my career,

12:08.060 --> 12:09.979
is to see
that justice is served,

12:10.062 --> 12:12.356
not just that security
is maintained.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.782
( hyperventilating )

12:21.866 --> 12:24.577
Melissa on phone:
<i>Okay, just breathe.</i>
<i>Breathe.</i>

12:24.660 --> 12:27.079
<i>It sounds like</i>
<i>everything you said</i>
<i>is correct.</i>

12:27.163 --> 12:28.622
- ( groans )
-<i> Breathe.</i>

12:28.706 --> 12:30.708
I'd say maybe--
maybe the first part.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.543
- ( exhales )
-<i> Yeah, yeah.</i>

12:32.626 --> 12:34.462
<i>You know, maybe</i>
<i>the "security is maintained"</i>
<i>thing</i>

12:34.545 --> 12:37.006
<i>was a little harsh,</i>
<i>but screw it, it's true.</i>

12:37.089 --> 12:38.757
Yeah, it is true, right?

12:38.841 --> 12:40.551
It is true, right?
Right?

12:40.634 --> 12:42.303
- Oh...
-<i> Yes, yes, honey.</i>

12:42.386 --> 12:44.263
And I totally planned
none of it.

12:44.346 --> 12:45.514
( exhales )

12:45.598 --> 12:47.516
It's just as I was...
( sniffles )

12:47.600 --> 12:51.395
as I was going,
I was starting-- I was
starting to get on a roll.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.897
( exhales )

12:52.980 --> 12:55.441
And the words just started
coming out, you know?

12:55.524 --> 12:59.236
Why did Alan suddenly get
that new job, huh? Why?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.738
Do you know
who his clients are?

13:00.821 --> 13:02.364
Do you know who
his clients are?

13:02.448 --> 13:04.116
You know
who his clients are?

13:04.200 --> 13:06.827
They're the O'Connors,
the Kazmarskys,

13:06.911 --> 13:08.829
the Rileys, the Loutts,
the Weeds.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.873
( wheezing )

13:10.956 --> 13:12.625
And they are all
the same people

13:12.708 --> 13:14.210
who supported
Dick Andreesen.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.253
Why? Why?!

13:16.337 --> 13:17.963
Oh.
( exhales, inhales )

13:18.047 --> 13:20.716
Oh, the hush of heaven
holds my heart today.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.801
The hush of heaven holds
my heart today.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.637
- The hush of heaven
holds my heart--
-<i> Shh, shh, shh.</i>

13:24.720 --> 13:27.223
Sorry, sorry.
I was getting riled again.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.767
<i>I know, I know.</i>
<i>Can you drive?</i>

13:29.850 --> 13:32.228
( crying silently )

13:32.311 --> 13:33.562
<i>Honey?</i>

13:35.397 --> 13:36.774
<i>Can you drive?</i>

13:38.442 --> 13:39.944
Absolutely.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.613
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>-</i> Absolutely, I can drive.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.241
Oh.
( exhales )

13:46.450 --> 13:47.535
Thank you.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.036
Thank you, Melissa.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.704
- ( sniffles )
-<i> Okay, babe. Don't worry.</i>

13:50.788 --> 13:53.415
- I love you.
-<i> I love you, too.</i>

13:53.499 --> 13:56.919
Alan:
<i>Tom, what can I dig you</i>
<i>out of?</i>

13:57.002 --> 13:59.088
Have you seen
any of this stuff?

13:59.171 --> 14:01.590
<i>Yeah, just watching it now.</i>

14:01.674 --> 14:03.634
Huh, kooky stuff.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.761
It's kooky.
Um...

14:05.844 --> 14:10.182
<i>Listen, I'm feeling a little</i>
<i>behind the eight ball here.</i>

14:10.266 --> 14:14.603
<i>The family calling and asking</i>
<i>what's true, what's not.</i>

14:14.687 --> 14:17.481
<i>There's no urgency with this</i>
<i>whatsoever, but I just--</i>

14:17.565 --> 14:20.234
<i>I'd love to get filled in</i>
<i>on whatever gossip</i>

14:20.317 --> 14:22.570
<i>or, honestly,</i>
<i>even genuine news</i>

14:22.653 --> 14:24.613
<i>that flies across</i>
<i>your transom.</i>

14:24.697 --> 14:26.949
Sure, Tom.
Let me see what I can do.

14:27.032 --> 14:30.202
Anything in particular
you're looking for?

14:30.286 --> 14:33.247
<i>Uh, yeah, it'd just</i>
<i>be nice to know</i>

14:33.330 --> 14:35.916
<i>where this</i>
<i>is all headed.</i>

14:38.294 --> 14:39.587
I see.

14:41.297 --> 14:45.217
Sure, you bet.
Let me see what I can dig up.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.428
<i>Thanks, buddy.</i>
<i>I appreciate it.</i>

14:47.511 --> 14:49.138
Mm-hmm.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.265
Reporter on TV:
<i>...as the frozen body</i>
<i>of Olivia Lake</i>

14:51.348 --> 14:55.144
<i>along with a T-shirt</i>
<i>found buried with the body</i>
<i>was discovered.</i>

14:55.227 --> 14:57.271
<i>Sources say</i>
<i>the shirt was torn</i>

14:57.354 --> 14:58.939
<i>and appeared</i>
<i>almost tie-dyed,</i>

14:59.023 --> 15:00.774
<i>which our in-house</i>
<i>forensics expert</i>

15:00.858 --> 15:03.277
<i>Mark Chamberlin says</i>
<i>might mean it was used</i>

15:03.360 --> 15:05.779
<i>to try and bleach away</i>
<i>the blood.</i>

15:05.863 --> 15:09.283
<i>Also found-- this mysterious</i>
<i>blue piece of plastic</i>

15:09.366 --> 15:11.577
<i>that might have been used</i>
<i>in the murder itself</i>

15:11.660 --> 15:14.622
<i>or perhaps also</i>
<i>in the disposal of the body,</i>

15:14.705 --> 15:16.999
<i>which sources connected</i>
<i>with the lab say</i>

15:17.082 --> 15:18.917
<i>it was found</i>
<i>wedged into the skin</i>

15:19.001 --> 15:21.170
<i>of Olivia Lake's rib cage.</i>

15:21.253 --> 15:22.838
<i>In another new,</i>
<i>bizarre twist,</i>

15:22.921 --> 15:26.508
<i>a man named Casey Delacroix</i>
<i>reached out to KSL-5</i>

15:26.592 --> 15:28.927
<i>and told us</i>
<i>some very strange</i>
<i>information.</i>

15:29.011 --> 15:30.471
<i>( TV turns off )</i>

15:40.773 --> 15:43.233
<i>( phone buzzing )</i>

15:56.246 --> 15:59.792
<i>( mouse and keyboard</i>
<i>clicking )</i>

16:28.946 --> 16:30.864
Man on phone:
<i>In-room dining.</i>
<i>How can I help you?</i>

16:30.948 --> 16:33.117
<i>-</i> Joel:<i> Hello,</i>
room service?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

16:33.200 --> 16:34.910
Yeah, hi.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.704
Can you have somebody
please come up

16:36.787 --> 16:39.707
and remove the liquor
from my minibar?

16:39.790 --> 16:41.041
<i>Absolutely, sir.</i>
<i>Not a problem.</i>

16:41.125 --> 16:42.209
<i>I'll have someone</i>
<i>come right up.</i>

16:42.292 --> 16:43.794
<i>That's room 304?</i>

16:43.877 --> 16:45.170
Yeah, 304.
Thank you.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.714
<i>No problem, sir.</i>
<i>Right away.</i>

16:56.140 --> 16:58.934
<i>( phone buzzing )</i>

17:05.232 --> 17:07.234
Hello?

17:07.317 --> 17:10.529
Man #2:
<i>Hello, I'm looking</i>
<i>for Joel Hurley.</i>

17:10.612 --> 17:12.239
Nate:
<i>Come on, man.</i>

17:12.322 --> 17:13.907
<i>Look, I'm dealing with</i>
<i>a lot of stuff right now.</i>

17:13.991 --> 17:15.617
I feel super weird
about this.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.287
Like I'm condemning the guy
all of a sudden.

17:18.370 --> 17:22.416
Dude, yesterday,
all you wanted to do
was talk about the lie.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.460
Yeah, but that was
getting something
off my chest.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.003
This is putting
something on my chest.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.171
Frank!

17:28.422 --> 17:30.799
( exhales )

17:30.883 --> 17:32.801
It was his right hand.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.470
It was red
and swollen

17:34.553 --> 17:37.306
and there was,
like, a crack, okay,

17:37.389 --> 17:39.475
like, at the knuckle.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.310
- You're certain of this?
- Yeah.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.437
I saw it when
I was pulling up,
and I was like,

17:43.520 --> 17:45.564
"Dude, that's
your drawing hand.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.107
What happened?"

17:47.191 --> 17:48.650
What did he say?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.235
He and Laura
got into a fight.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.613
He said he punched
a wall.

17:52.696 --> 17:55.115
She was acting
all self-righteous.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.076
You know
how she can get.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.620
Actually,
I don't know her
to be that way, no.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.331
Yeah, well, trust me,
underneath all that sweetness--

18:02.414 --> 18:07.086
- anyways, that's why he went
with the girl, okay?
- ( phone buzzing )

18:07.169 --> 18:09.296
- So the story goes.
- Uh...

18:11.173 --> 18:13.050
Hey, Joel.
What's up, buddy?

18:13.133 --> 18:14.760
- Joel:<i> Yeah, hey, Nate.</i>
- ( mouthing ) I'm not here.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.638
<i>Some Cameron info for ya.</i>
<i>A lead, I think.</i>

18:17.721 --> 18:19.348
- Really?
-<i> Yeah.</i>

18:19.431 --> 18:22.351
- Okay.
-<i> So, there was someone</i>
who actually tried

18:22.434 --> 18:24.895
<i>to fence Olivia's drawing</i>
<i>that was stolen from the safe,</i>

18:24.978 --> 18:27.314
<i>and I have</i>
<i>the guy's email address.</i>

18:27.397 --> 18:29.149
-<i> Here, I'll give it to you.</i>
- You have his email address?

18:29.233 --> 18:31.401
-<i> Yeah.</i>
- Uh, well, great.

18:31.485 --> 18:34.530
I wanna take that down.
Pen and paper, please.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.448
-<i> You ready?</i>
- Sure, yeah.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.743
<i>Okay, it's ray.breslin@jnet.</i>

18:39.827 --> 18:42.037
Ray.breslin--

18:42.120 --> 18:44.957
- B-R-E-S...
-<i> L-I-N.</i>

18:45.040 --> 18:46.875
- ...L-I-N@...
-<i> Yeah, @jnet.</i>

18:46.959 --> 18:48.710
...jnet.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.379
Okay, cool.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.506
-<i> Yeah.</i>
- I will look into that.
Thank you.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.216
<i>Yeah, you're welcome.</i>
<i>You're welcome.</i>

18:54.299 --> 18:57.094
Hey, um,
are you okay?

18:58.303 --> 18:59.721
You doing all right?

18:59.805 --> 19:01.807
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Yeah, good.</i>

19:01.890 --> 19:03.058
<i>Great.</i>

19:03.141 --> 19:04.977
No, it's just
'cause, uh,

19:05.060 --> 19:10.107
you sounded
a little, uh,
off earlier.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.984
<i>No, I'm good.</i>
<i>I'm good.</i>

19:12.067 --> 19:14.778
<i>Uh, how about you?</i>

19:14.862 --> 19:16.196
Me? No, I'm--
I'm good.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.906
- I'm-- I'm all good.
-<i> Yeah?</i>

19:17.990 --> 19:20.367
-<i> You doing okay?</i>
- Yeah.

19:20.450 --> 19:23.287
- Yep, yeah.
-<i> Hey, any new news?</i>

19:23.370 --> 19:26.874
Nope.
No, uh-- no news.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.710
- Nope.
-<i> Hey, I gotta, uh--</i>

19:29.793 --> 19:32.004
<i>I gotta check in</i>
<i>with Laura here, so.</i>

19:32.087 --> 19:35.257
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hey, tell her I said, "Hi."

19:35.340 --> 19:36.758
Okay, bye.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.642
<i>( touchpad clicks )</i>

19:47.686 --> 19:51.106
- So you still want
the minibar--
- Yeah!

19:51.189 --> 19:52.858
Laura over phone:
<i>I don't understand.</i>

19:52.941 --> 19:54.610
<i>When?</i>

19:54.693 --> 19:57.321
I would say
the next possible flight.

19:57.404 --> 20:01.074
There's one out of MSY
that gets you in at 6:00,

20:01.158 --> 20:03.493
puts you in Summit
by 6:45.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.748
<i>Nate, you need to tell me</i>
<i>what's happening.</i>

20:07.831 --> 20:09.249
<i>I talked to him</i>
<i>five minutes ago.</i>

20:09.333 --> 20:11.084
<i>He said nothing.</i>

20:11.168 --> 20:13.211
Um...
( clears throat )

20:13.295 --> 20:15.964
only thing
I can tell you is, uh...

20:16.048 --> 20:19.176
you-- you really should
be here, Laura.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.178
I know this is maybe
making it more difficult,

20:21.261 --> 20:24.264
but for Joel's sake,

20:24.348 --> 20:28.352
you can't talk to him
until you and I speak
in person.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.065
How serious is this?

20:33.148 --> 20:35.233
Did-- did he do something?

20:38.111 --> 20:40.656
<i>We'll talk</i>
<i>when you get here, okay?</i>

20:46.703 --> 20:48.372
Okay, bye.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.185
Hey.

21:12.646 --> 21:13.939
You okay?

21:15.524 --> 21:17.401
I need to go
to Summit.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.237
Now?

21:23.782 --> 21:26.743
Joel's in some kind
of trouble, I think.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.540
Nate, a friend of ours,
a cop...

21:31.623 --> 21:34.543
he won't tell me anything
until I get there.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.336
And he says that...

21:37.629 --> 21:39.881
I shouldn't
talk to Joel

21:39.965 --> 21:42.342
until he and I speak.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.802
( exhales )

21:43.885 --> 21:45.929
Shit, babe.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.681
I'm sorry.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.560
Oh...

21:51.643 --> 21:53.145
Man:
<i>He's fictional.</i>

21:53.228 --> 21:54.730
What do you mean
he's fictional?

21:54.813 --> 21:56.314
He is a character
from a movie.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.859
Ray Breslin is
Stallone's character
from "Escape Plan."

22:00.110 --> 22:01.361
What-- what
about the email?

22:01.445 --> 22:03.030
The email is registered
to Cameron Morgan.

22:03.113 --> 22:05.032
We knew where he was
on December 31st.

22:05.115 --> 22:07.534
- Yeah.
- Excuse me, Detective,
someone named Petra Neill

22:07.617 --> 22:08.994
says she's been
trying to reach you.

22:09.077 --> 22:10.704
Tell her I've been
getting her texts

22:10.787 --> 22:12.456
and she needs to stop
trying to call me.

22:12.539 --> 22:15.542
In fact,
you can tell-- mm-hmm.

22:15.625 --> 22:18.295
Hi. We can't talk.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.088
We never should have
started talking.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.674
Listen, this is
big-picture thing.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.509
When this is over,
maybe,

22:24.593 --> 22:27.763
but until then,
you must stop trying
to reach me.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.097
I'm sorry.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.891
She doesn't
get through again.

22:30.974 --> 22:33.393
- Um, you're gonna
hate this.
- Why?

22:33.477 --> 22:35.145
Turn on Channel 6.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.818
Can I get
some volume?

22:41.902 --> 22:45.322
...quoting sources now
who say two items were
found with the body--

22:45.405 --> 22:47.741
a T-shirt
badly worn away
by bleach

22:47.824 --> 22:49.993
and a small,
blue plastic triangle

22:50.077 --> 22:52.621
that might have been used
to bury the body.

22:52.704 --> 22:56.541
Oh, gosh darn it!

22:56.625 --> 22:57.959
Mike:
<i>It didn't start out</i>
<i>as a murder.</i>

22:58.043 --> 22:59.461
-<i> I think it escalated.</i>
- Mike!

22:59.544 --> 23:02.380
- Alan: A passion thing.
- It wasn't me.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.882
Then who the heck
was it?

23:03.965 --> 23:05.550
And what are you
doing here?

23:05.634 --> 23:07.719
- I have friends here.
- He wanted some information.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.805
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>it'd be a big deal</i>
<i>giving it to him.</i>

23:09.888 --> 23:12.099
- Oh, Alan.
- I just got here!
I had no way to leak that.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.475
See, I've been
thinking about it,

23:13.558 --> 23:15.977
and I think it was someone
from transport or IT.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.313
I can't believe this.
I can't freaking believe this.

23:18.396 --> 23:22.109
It's bad enough
we got Andreesen digging up
Casey freakin' Delacroix now!

23:22.192 --> 23:24.694
- We don't know he did that.
- Then who else could it be?

23:24.778 --> 23:26.196
Who else even has
that information?

23:26.279 --> 23:28.824
Who else doesn't want
Eric Neill appealing?

23:28.907 --> 23:30.700
Find out
who leaked this.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.119
- Nate, Nate...
- Wait, don't.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.954
Hold on.
I got an idea.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.581
Nate, Nate,
you got a minute?

23:36.665 --> 23:38.750
Actually, Alan, I don't.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.588
Tom:
So, how do
they know all this?

23:43.672 --> 23:46.591
Alan:
It's all about
carbon dioxide levels.

23:48.176 --> 23:51.721
And they're thinking it was
attempted strangulation,

23:51.805 --> 23:56.518
followed by the blunt force
trauma to the jaw?

23:56.601 --> 23:59.104
My guy there's
pretty convinced
it was a rush job.

23:59.187 --> 24:00.897
Accidental.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.233
By an amateur.

24:03.316 --> 24:05.318
She was upset.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.404
Maybe...

24:07.487 --> 24:10.740
somebody tried
to stop her.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.784
There were bits
from the floor,

24:12.868 --> 24:15.954
cleaning solution resin
or something in her nails.

24:17.831 --> 24:22.711
Bruises on the knee,
which means, you know...

24:25.422 --> 24:28.049
scraping the ground,
crawling.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.635
Which means she fell.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.013
Probably tried
to get away.

24:33.096 --> 24:35.724
- She was kicked.
- Hmm.

24:35.807 --> 24:39.102
Fell back, perhaps.
Got up. Strangled.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.731
That didn't work.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.526
And then the punch.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.528
By a right-handed person.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.197
They can tell that
for sure?

24:50.280 --> 24:53.700
Oh, fairly certain.
It's incredible what
they can do now.

24:53.783 --> 24:55.952
Oh.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.412
Eric Neill?

24:59.206 --> 25:02.250
- Is left-handed.
- Hmm.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.837
And so that was what...

25:05.921 --> 25:07.714
Oh, no.

25:07.797 --> 25:09.257
It was a hammer.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.468
Two or three,
maybe four blows.

25:11.551 --> 25:12.886
- Eesh.
- Yeah.

25:16.806 --> 25:19.768
So how are you
with all this?

25:19.851 --> 25:21.937
What do you mean?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.980
Well, personally...

25:26.983 --> 25:28.109
What?

25:28.193 --> 25:29.778
Well, you--

25:29.861 --> 25:32.030
- you had that thing
with her a while ago.
- I'm fine.

25:32.113 --> 25:33.865
Why?
No, no. No.

25:33.949 --> 25:37.953
- Is that clouding
anything for you?
- No. No, that...

25:38.036 --> 25:41.665
We were a brief thing

25:41.748 --> 25:44.668
about...
a dozen years ago.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.503
I mean, hell,
you know,

25:46.586 --> 25:49.506
it was upsetting
seeing her

25:49.589 --> 25:51.841
come out
of the ground.

25:51.925 --> 25:55.553
But after a few minutes,
it was all line-of-work stuff.

25:59.307 --> 26:00.976
Well, that's good
to know.

26:01.059 --> 26:02.352
Hmm.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.814
Oh, hey, listen.
Um...

26:05.897 --> 26:10.443
I've been hearing some concerns
from some of the neighbors.

26:10.527 --> 26:13.446
It's funny,
some of them
are two miles away.

26:13.530 --> 26:14.781
We call them neighbors.

26:14.864 --> 26:17.325
About all the activity
on our property--

26:17.409 --> 26:18.994
on everyone's properties.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.121
So, I just wanted
to give you a heads up

26:21.204 --> 26:25.917
so you're not surprised
when you see some new faces
around here for a little while.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.169
I'm sorry, new faces?

26:28.253 --> 26:31.506
We've got an operation
in Atlanta.

26:31.589 --> 26:33.300
They're lending us
some of their team.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.634
I don't want
to bore you with it.

26:34.718 --> 26:37.762
Dave Dorenzo
will give you a call.

26:37.846 --> 26:40.807
<i>He just landed.</i>
<i>He'll download you.</i>
<i>He's got your number.</i>

26:43.351 --> 26:47.272
And-- and I'm...
too, uh...

26:47.355 --> 26:48.982
<i>Hold tight.</i>

26:49.065 --> 26:52.944
<i>We'll let the frenzy</i>
<i>on the hill play itself out.</i>

26:53.028 --> 26:56.072
<i>Let's take it as it comes.</i>
<i>It's all good.</i>

26:56.156 --> 26:58.241
Nate:
<i>Morgan. Hey, Morgan!</i>

26:58.325 --> 26:59.993
<i>Who's that?</i>

27:00.076 --> 27:01.953
<i>Who's that on TV?</i>

27:02.037 --> 27:04.164
<i>That guy</i>
<i>looks like your dad.</i>

27:04.247 --> 27:06.207
That really good-looking,

27:06.291 --> 27:08.251
big, tall, strapping,

27:08.335 --> 27:10.670
handsome,
talented young man

27:10.754 --> 27:14.215
looks like your dad
talking about his job on TV!

27:14.299 --> 27:16.009
It was you?

27:16.092 --> 27:17.969
- What?
- Who leaked it.

27:18.053 --> 27:20.013
- What?
- Nate.

27:20.096 --> 27:22.682
So-- what are you
talking about?

27:22.766 --> 27:24.517
- Yes, it was me!
- ( laughing )

27:24.601 --> 27:26.227
You should've seen me!

27:26.311 --> 27:30.190
I was all like,
"Pete, you know me.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.067
I don't talk
to no press."

27:32.150 --> 27:34.819
And then I dropped a card
right in his pocket

27:34.903 --> 27:36.196
and I winked at him.

27:36.279 --> 27:37.697
And it worked, right?

27:37.781 --> 27:40.158
Yeah, he's taking me
to dinner next Saturday.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.786
Yes, it worked!
Thank you so much!

27:42.869 --> 27:44.204
You are a genius.

27:44.287 --> 27:45.455
As soon as
the story dropped,

27:45.538 --> 27:48.375
Joel is, like,
boom, activated.

27:48.458 --> 27:49.709
I got Roberts
following him.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.044
I'm waiting to hear
the full report.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.838
- Holy crud.
- I know, right?

27:53.922 --> 27:55.590
Yeah.

27:55.673 --> 27:58.134
Mmm, I gotta go.
She's landing.

27:58.218 --> 28:01.930
So, did Joel know he did it
and he's just been lying?

28:04.015 --> 28:07.268
I-- I could not
tell you.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.397
But freaking Andreesen,

28:10.480 --> 28:13.566
- if he wants to start
a war with Nate Henry...
- ( keypad beeping )

28:13.650 --> 28:16.069
...he better be prepared
to get a taste...

28:16.152 --> 28:18.071
- ( safe closes )
- ...of his own medicine.

28:18.154 --> 28:21.574
I just don't understand
why Andreesen cares that much

28:21.658 --> 28:24.619
about Eric Neill
staying under.

28:24.702 --> 28:27.622
It's his job.
It's embarrassment.

28:27.705 --> 28:29.249
What if he got it
wrong?

28:31.501 --> 28:33.753
You should have heard
the way that he talked to me.

28:35.255 --> 28:38.133
He's gonna regret it,
and Alan is,

28:38.216 --> 28:41.136
and the whole political
mountain-hillside,

28:41.219 --> 28:44.055
ginormous cabal, baby.

28:44.139 --> 28:47.642
Sorry, is that
a bit too big,
too fast thinking?

28:47.725 --> 28:49.477
- Little bit?
Little bit?
- Mmm.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.021
Little bit. Okay.
( inhales, exhales )

28:52.105 --> 28:53.940
Okay, take it
down a notch.

28:54.023 --> 28:57.610
All will be revealed.
All will be revealed
in due time.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.404
Good-bye, my boy.
Mm-wah!

28:59.487 --> 29:01.948
- I love you.
- If it makes
any sense, say hi.

29:03.324 --> 29:04.451
I will.

29:06.369 --> 29:07.328
Thank you.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.622
<i>( phone buzzing )</i>

29:13.334 --> 29:15.253
Yo, Roberts, how--

29:17.297 --> 29:18.423
How far?

29:19.757 --> 29:22.177
Okay, okay,
we still have time.

29:32.395 --> 29:34.731
( chatter )

29:37.567 --> 29:40.320
Okay, what the hell
is going on?

29:40.403 --> 29:41.654
Hi. Good to see you again.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.448
I'm-- I'm looking
for Horacio.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.700
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>where he'd be</i>
<i>right about now?</i>

29:45.783 --> 29:49.370
Uh, right now he'd be
at the Millers' house.

29:49.454 --> 29:52.832
- The Millers?
- You know Splendid Valley Road
up to the left?

29:52.916 --> 29:54.501
I think so.
Splendid Valley,

29:54.584 --> 29:56.669
just stay on and take
a left to go out, yeah?

29:56.753 --> 29:58.630
-<i> Yes, uh-huh.</i>
- All right.
Great to see you again.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.048
Thank you.

30:29.285 --> 30:30.286
Hey!

30:34.749 --> 30:35.750
- ( motor stops )
- Hi, Horacio.

30:35.833 --> 30:38.086
Uh, really weird
question

30:38.169 --> 30:41.005
about an insurance form
I might have left in the truck.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.757
Mind if I take
a look?

30:47.804 --> 30:50.181
- Okay.
-<i> Gracias.</i>

31:01.985 --> 31:04.404
( lawn mower whirring )

31:15.999 --> 31:18.501
<i>( objects clanking )</i>

31:39.314 --> 31:40.481
Got it, thanks!

31:46.237 --> 31:48.448
Joel's voice:
<i>Another trash can.</i>

31:48.531 --> 31:50.783
<i>No-- you're missing</i>
<i>your chance, man.</i>

31:50.867 --> 31:53.161
<i>There's a gas station.</i>
<i>You passed four gas stations.</i>

31:53.244 --> 31:56.456
<i>Just pull over.</i>
<i>Just pull over, man.</i>

31:56.539 --> 31:58.750
<i>Just pull over.</i>
<i>Just pull over!</i>

31:58.833 --> 32:00.335
-<i> Just pull over, Joel.</i>
- Okay, all right.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.003
-<i> Just pull over.</i>
- Okay, I will!

32:02.086 --> 32:04.756
<i>There's a gas station.</i>
<i>Just pull over, Joel!</i>

32:10.261 --> 32:11.554
( whispers )
Shut up.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.182
Shut up.
Shut up.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.769
Shut up.
I'm doing it.

32:18.936 --> 32:20.188
He's not looking.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.945
( panting )

32:33.409 --> 32:37.163
Nate:
<i>I can't imagine what</i>
<i>you're dealing with right now.</i>

32:38.373 --> 32:40.833
<i>I need you to know that...</i>

32:40.917 --> 32:43.044
<i>I didn't get into this</i>
<i>to try and take down a friend.</i>

32:43.127 --> 32:44.504
It's okay, Nate.

32:49.842 --> 32:51.594
I'm not guessing
at this.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.179
I mean,
these are facts.

32:53.262 --> 32:55.723
- This happened.
-<i> It's okay, Nate.</i>

32:55.807 --> 32:58.393
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

33:05.650 --> 33:07.860
- Speaker?
- Yeah.

33:09.445 --> 33:11.239
- Hi, Joel.
- Joel:<i> Hey, babe, hey.</i>

33:11.322 --> 33:13.408
<i>I've been trying to reach you</i>
<i>for, like, two hours.</i>

33:13.491 --> 33:15.618
Laura:
<i>Oh, sorry, I had my phone</i>
<i>turned off for a thing.</i>

33:15.702 --> 33:18.746
Joel:<i> Never mind.</i>
<i>Hey, on the night,</i>
<i>that night,</i>

33:18.830 --> 33:20.206
<i>what was our fight about?</i>

33:20.289 --> 33:21.541
Laura:
<i>What night?</i>

33:21.624 --> 33:24.293
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>that night Olivia died.</i>

33:24.377 --> 33:26.421
<i>New Year's Eve.</i>
<i>Do you remember our fight?</i>

33:28.464 --> 33:31.801
Uh, yes. Why?

33:31.884 --> 33:33.386
<i>Did I hit a wall?</i>

33:36.848 --> 33:38.182
Laura:
<i>I don't know, Joel.</i>

33:38.266 --> 33:39.892
<i>I left.</i>
<i>You might have.</i>

33:39.976 --> 33:42.061
<i>You-- you said you did,</i>
<i>and so maybe you did,</i>

33:42.145 --> 33:45.189
<i>but-- but I honestly</i>
<i>don't know.</i>

33:45.273 --> 33:47.650
Joel:
<i>Did I do that a lot,</i>
<i>hit things?</i>

33:47.734 --> 33:50.027
Laura:
<i>When you drank.</i>
<i>You know this.</i>

33:50.111 --> 33:51.863
-<i> I can't talk</i>
right now, Joel.
- Joel:<i> But on the night...</i>

33:51.946 --> 33:54.490
<i>Back to that night,</i>
<i>what-- what did we fight about?</i>

33:58.077 --> 34:00.079
We fought about Olivia.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.085
<i>Hello?</i>

34:07.587 --> 34:09.839
Joel:
<i>Did I say why?</i>

34:09.922 --> 34:11.716
Laura:
<i>She said things to you.</i>

34:13.050 --> 34:15.219
Joel:
<i>What things?</i>

34:15.303 --> 34:17.013
Laura:
<i>Mean things.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

34:17.096 --> 34:18.973
<i>Does it matter?</i>
<i>I have to go, Joel.</i>

34:19.056 --> 34:21.642
-<i> Wait, what? Why?</i>
- I need-- I need to go.
I'm sorry.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.853
<i>Laura,</i>
<i>what did she say to me?</i>

34:25.354 --> 34:27.815
I-- I don't know,
you know.

34:29.150 --> 34:32.111
She wanted
to square up.

34:32.195 --> 34:34.530
I gotta go, Joel.
I'll see you soon.

34:34.614 --> 34:35.823
I'm sorry.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.500
( exhales )

34:52.381 --> 34:53.925
Laura:
<i>I don't understand!</i>

34:54.008 --> 34:56.177
<i>Are you mad at Olivia</i>
<i>or are you mad at me?</i>

34:56.260 --> 34:57.345
By the way
you're patronizing me,

34:57.428 --> 34:58.930
I can't tell
the fucking difference!

34:59.013 --> 35:00.306
<i>How is this</i>
<i>patronizing?!</i>

35:00.389 --> 35:02.183
We said we'd make changes
in the new year.

35:02.266 --> 35:04.477
- And it's New Year!
- Eve! It's still the old year!

35:04.560 --> 35:07.355
All I said is
I'm sick of things
that only lead to dead ends.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.981
Oh, because
I'm a dead end?

35:09.065 --> 35:10.650
- I told you
I don't want her--
- Oh, so you hate her,

35:10.733 --> 35:12.151
but apparently
you agree with her!

35:12.235 --> 35:13.569
You know what?
I'm done with this.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.822
Oh, yeah,
and you're done with me.

35:15.905 --> 35:20.034
<i>Jesus, what did she say</i>
<i>to you that's got you</i>
<i>acting like this?</i>

35:20.117 --> 35:21.744
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>I'm going to Melissa's.</i>

35:21.828 --> 35:23.955
<i>She invited us, I'm going.</i>
<i>You do whatever.</i>

35:24.038 --> 35:25.790
Fine, just get
the fuck out!

35:25.873 --> 35:27.667
<i>Fuck you, Joel.</i>

35:27.750 --> 35:29.877
Olivia:
<i>I'll show you mine</i>
<i>if you'll show me yours.</i>

35:32.296 --> 35:33.422
I'm sorry?

35:34.757 --> 35:37.677
Drawings, jeez.

35:37.760 --> 35:40.304
( both chuckling )

35:42.557 --> 35:45.351
You'll really look
at my stuff?

35:45.434 --> 35:46.561
Sure.

35:46.644 --> 35:47.937
You any good?

35:51.190 --> 35:54.485
( tsks )
You'll see.

35:54.569 --> 35:58.698
( laughing )

35:58.781 --> 36:01.200
<i>( people chattering,</i>
<i>whooping )</i>

36:01.284 --> 36:02.827
Martini coming up.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.832
Over the rocks, double.
I'm really surprised.

36:09.166 --> 36:10.877
You've hit
a wall, Joel.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.628
There's really
only two ways to go--

36:12.712 --> 36:16.090
either up and over it,
which I don't really
see happening, or...

36:16.173 --> 36:18.843
<i>back it up</i>
<i>and go another direction.</i>

36:18.926 --> 36:20.928
<i>( chatter continues )</i>

36:49.332 --> 36:51.626
- Joel! Hey, I've been
trying to reach you.
- Huh?

36:51.709 --> 36:53.753
What?
Uh, sorry.

36:53.836 --> 36:56.631
Um, some personal--
home.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.799
I need to talk to you.
It's important.

36:58.883 --> 37:02.094
I, um-- I actually
don't know how to say this.

37:02.178 --> 37:05.973
Um, when we met,
when I came to Louisiana,

37:06.057 --> 37:08.601
I, um-- I wasn't
direct with you.

37:08.684 --> 37:10.561
I was dishonest,
actually.

37:10.645 --> 37:13.773
<i>I, um-- yes, I was hoping</i>
<i>to find something to--</i>

37:13.856 --> 37:17.026
-<i> to reopen Eric's case,</i>
<i>but in truth--</i>
-<i> ( phone buzzing )</i>

37:17.109 --> 37:19.779
Shit, it's Horacio.
I have to take this.

37:19.862 --> 37:21.614
Don't go anywhere,
please.

37:21.697 --> 37:22.907
Please don't go.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.576
<i>¿Hola?</i>

37:41.259 --> 37:44.679
- When?
- She just got in
a little while ago.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.138
When I called,
you were...?

37:51.060 --> 37:52.186
( sighs )

37:52.269 --> 37:54.021
Did you...

37:54.105 --> 37:57.358
Nate:
<i>We've been discussing</i>
<i>various things.</i>

37:57.441 --> 37:59.944
<i>Mostly, how you guys</i>
<i>left Summit.</i>

38:01.654 --> 38:05.491
<i>Sobriety,</i>
<i>the blackouts, debts.</i>

38:05.574 --> 38:07.451
Can I talk to you?

38:07.535 --> 38:09.829
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

38:09.912 --> 38:11.956
Here's what
I wanna do now--

38:12.039 --> 38:15.001
I wanna go into the hallway
with you for a moment.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.752
Laura's gonna
stay here.

38:18.421 --> 38:21.090
<i>Then you and her</i>
<i>can have a heart-to-heart.</i>

38:25.428 --> 38:26.762
Come on.

38:28.347 --> 38:29.932
<i>( door opens )</i>

38:32.476 --> 38:34.020
Joel.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.954
( exhales )

38:55.666 --> 38:59.503
Just gonna say
a few things that I know

38:59.587 --> 39:02.256
and a few things
I'd like to find out about.

39:05.634 --> 39:07.428
<i>Ray Breslin...</i>

39:07.511 --> 39:11.515
<i>is Sylvester Stallone's</i>
<i>character in "Escape Plan."</i>

39:14.602 --> 39:16.896
<i>Joel, you seem to be</i>
<i>a bit preoccupied.</i>

39:16.979 --> 39:18.773
<i>Are you</i>
<i>listening to me?</i>

39:18.856 --> 39:21.067
What?

39:21.150 --> 39:24.612
Ray.breslin@jnet.

39:24.695 --> 39:27.406
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>then that'd be Cameron.</i>

39:29.533 --> 39:31.327
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

39:31.410 --> 39:33.579
<i>Maybe.</i>

39:33.662 --> 39:37.875
<i>Sure, he, um-- he tried</i>
<i>to fence the drawings.</i>

39:37.958 --> 39:40.961
<i>But guess where he was</i>
<i>on New Year's Eve.</i>

39:42.338 --> 39:45.424
<i>He was in jail</i>
<i>in Tucson.</i>

39:45.508 --> 39:47.009
<i>Parole violation.</i>

39:49.678 --> 39:51.097
<i>Anyhow...</i>

39:52.681 --> 39:55.309
<i>I got out of a meeting</i>
<i>with forensics today.</i>

39:55.393 --> 39:56.936
<i>( papers rustling )</i>

39:59.230 --> 40:01.148
I got a copy
of the report for you.

40:01.232 --> 40:05.277
<i>You can read it</i>
<i>if you want later.</i>

40:05.361 --> 40:07.780
<i>Maybe it'll help</i>
<i>jog something.</i>

40:11.117 --> 40:12.535
<i>The short of it?</i>

40:15.204 --> 40:19.125
Olivia was hit on the jaw
on the left side of her face

40:19.208 --> 40:21.210
by somebody
who's right-handed.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.338
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if you know this,</i>

40:24.422 --> 40:26.882
<i>but Eric Neill</i>
<i>is left-handed.</i>

40:28.592 --> 40:33.806
<i>Your right hand was bruised,</i>
<i>red, and swollen,</i>

40:33.889 --> 40:37.560
<i>both when Tia picked you up</i>
<i>at midnight--</i>

40:37.643 --> 40:40.938
<i>11:57, to be exact--</i>

40:41.021 --> 40:44.984
<i>and the next morning</i>
<i>when Frank got you in town.</i>

40:45.067 --> 40:47.736
<i>But listen, that's--</i>
<i>that's the least of it.</i>

40:50.573 --> 40:52.908
<i>We had someone</i>
<i>following you today, man.</i>

40:54.910 --> 40:56.495
<i>As soon as you saw</i>
<i>the information</i>

40:56.579 --> 40:58.372
<i>about what was found</i>
<i>with the body,</i>

40:58.455 --> 41:01.500
<i>you left the hotel.</i>

41:01.584 --> 41:04.503
<i>You went</i>
<i>to Marcellus County.</i>

41:04.587 --> 41:07.756
<i>That's where the gardener,</i>
<i>Horacio, lives.</i>

41:09.341 --> 41:11.760
<i>He's the guy</i>
<i>you sold the truck to</i>

41:11.844 --> 41:13.220
<i>after the murder.</i>

41:13.304 --> 41:15.222
( no audible dialogue )

41:15.306 --> 41:16.765
<i>After Horacio...</i>

41:18.225 --> 41:22.188
<i>you went to a gas station</i>
<i>on I-80.</i>

41:22.271 --> 41:25.316
We've got guys headed down
to the gas station now.

41:25.399 --> 41:28.110
I've instructed them
to check the Dumpsters.

41:31.614 --> 41:33.824
<i>You wanna tell me</i>
<i>what they're gonna find, or...</i>

41:35.409 --> 41:37.036
<i>should I hear it</i>
<i>from them?</i>

41:38.662 --> 41:40.623
So, what happens now?

41:43.334 --> 41:47.588
<i>Now I go back to my office</i>
<i>and I write up a warrant.</i>

41:47.671 --> 41:49.298
( sighs )

41:49.381 --> 41:53.052
<i>And I go to the prosecutor</i>
<i>first thing in the morning,</i>

41:53.135 --> 41:57.598
<i>and when he signs it--</i>
<i>and I do believe that</i>
<i>he will sign it--</i>

41:57.681 --> 41:59.683
<i>then I talk</i>
<i>to Judge Warren...</i>

42:01.518 --> 42:02.895
<i>in chambers</i>

42:02.978 --> 42:04.897
<i>and I tell her</i>
<i>what I'm telling you now.</i>

42:06.398 --> 42:08.067
<i>And she approves it.</i>

42:09.860 --> 42:12.655
<i>Joel, then I come back</i>
<i>to this hotel room...</i>

42:15.074 --> 42:18.369
<i>and you and Laura</i>
<i>are gonna have to decide</i>
<i>how to play this.</i>

42:25.417 --> 42:28.629
I remember what
Olivia and I were
arguing about.

42:30.923 --> 42:32.466
She said
I owed her money

42:32.549 --> 42:35.511
and I said,
"It's not fair."

42:38.055 --> 42:40.849
And then
I think I told her
she wasn't honest.

42:44.436 --> 42:47.022
And she said to me
that I'll never
make it as a--

42:47.106 --> 42:49.775
as an artist.

42:49.858 --> 42:51.902
And that the only reason
I was on the farm

42:51.986 --> 42:54.071
was because
she wanted to fuck me.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.492
So I went to you.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.998
You asked me what was wrong
and I said some stuff.

43:05.457 --> 43:08.085
And I seem to remember
you siding with her.

43:09.586 --> 43:12.047
Only about the fact
she wanted to fuck you.

43:17.845 --> 43:20.556
And I don't remember
anything after that.

43:23.434 --> 43:25.227
It's funny,
I was like,

43:25.311 --> 43:26.687
"Joel loves that truck.

43:26.770 --> 43:28.605
Why does he wanna
sell it so fast?

43:28.689 --> 43:30.482
He doesn't care
what Horacio pays for it,

43:30.566 --> 43:33.235
he just wants it sold.

43:33.319 --> 43:35.321
Suddenly, Joel's the guy
who wants to leave town

43:35.404 --> 43:37.656
when I've been telling him
I wanna leave for,
like, a year?"

43:38.907 --> 43:40.451
( sighs )

43:42.244 --> 43:45.873
I have memories
from before and from after,

43:45.956 --> 43:49.251
and I'm--
I'm starting to get some
from in between, I think.

43:52.796 --> 43:56.258
Did you go
to the movies
with Frank?

43:57.634 --> 43:58.844
<i>No.</i>

44:05.768 --> 44:07.436
Were you with
someone else?

44:11.190 --> 44:13.567
No.

44:13.650 --> 44:16.487
But I thought I was,
and I'm so sorry.

44:20.657 --> 44:22.576
I don't understand.

44:22.659 --> 44:25.037
You thought you were
with someone else?

44:25.120 --> 44:28.707
<i>I thought I did</i>
<i>sleep with someone.</i>

44:28.791 --> 44:33.504
And I thought
I was helping you
by not telling you.

44:33.587 --> 44:36.924
But I was afraid,
'cause you're such
a good person.

44:37.007 --> 44:40.594
- Joel, don't.
-<i> You moved to</i>
Louisiana for me.

44:40.677 --> 44:42.930
- With you!
-<i> No, but you</i>
didn't wanna go.

44:43.013 --> 44:45.432
Not-- not there.
And you've been a rock

44:45.516 --> 44:48.769
and-- and a sponsor
and a friend

44:48.852 --> 44:50.270
-<i> and a partner.</i>
- Please don't!

44:50.354 --> 44:51.814
<i>That's why I wanted</i>
<i>to leave Summit.</i>

44:51.897 --> 44:53.857
<i>That's why I wanted</i>
<i>to put it behind, and--</i>

44:53.941 --> 44:58.237
and it's been
killing me a little bit
every day since then.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.072
And for one second
yesterday,

45:00.155 --> 45:02.658
I-- I was so relieved

45:02.741 --> 45:04.827
to find out that
I didn't cheat on you.

45:04.910 --> 45:07.746
<i>But I-- I don't</i>
<i>remember that night.</i>

45:07.830 --> 45:09.498
<i>I don't remember</i>
<i>what happened,</i>

45:09.581 --> 45:11.458
<i>and I thought I did,</i>
<i>and now it's just</i>
<i>all a blank.</i>

45:11.542 --> 45:14.878
<i>And when anybody tells me</i>
<i>what might have happened,</i>

45:14.962 --> 45:16.880
<i>I start to see it</i>
<i>like it did,</i>

45:16.964 --> 45:18.632
and I don't know
if it's real

45:18.715 --> 45:21.552
or if I'm having these images
because they said them to me.

45:23.804 --> 45:26.557
But I...
( sighs, sniffles )

45:26.640 --> 45:29.393
I do know that
I hated my life.

45:29.476 --> 45:32.479
<i>And I know</i>
<i>I was angry, and...</i>

45:32.563 --> 45:36.733
I mean,
I was a ski instructor,
then a bartender,

45:36.817 --> 45:40.320
then a groundskeeper/I-don't-
even-know-what-the-fuck-I-was.

45:40.404 --> 45:43.407
And-- and I lived
in a barn.

45:46.243 --> 45:48.287
What does your gut
tell you?

45:48.370 --> 45:49.788
<i>I don't know.</i>

45:53.417 --> 45:55.752
What does your soul
tell you?

45:57.296 --> 46:00.257
That I need
to think, or...

46:02.509 --> 46:06.013
I don't know,
maybe not think.
( sniffles )

46:06.096 --> 46:09.516
( exhales )
The messed-up thing, Joel?

46:11.768 --> 46:14.104
I still believe
you're a good man.

46:17.524 --> 46:19.359
Whatever that means.

46:22.362 --> 46:26.033
I believe
you are going to do
the right thing.

46:54.978 --> 46:56.730
( engine starts )

47:10.744 --> 47:12.287
( engine turns off )

47:40.440 --> 47:42.526
<i>( paper rustling )</i>

48:01.461 --> 48:02.921
( sighs )

48:09.720 --> 48:12.681
( no audible dialogue )

49:13.241 --> 49:15.118
I know what
I have to do.
