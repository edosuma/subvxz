00:01.629 --> 00:03.572
- Chapter Four:
For Tom and Sarah,

00:03.672 --> 00:05.134
having a rich brother
was complicated.

00:05.234 --> 00:06.976
On the one hand,
Connor's wealth

00:07.076 --> 00:08.538
made them feel like
the failures of the family.

00:08.638 --> 00:10.060
On the other hand,
he was a great source

00:10.160 --> 00:11.582
of hand-me-downs: toys,

00:11.682 --> 00:12.904
children's clothing,
and even...

00:13.004 --> 00:14.706
A six-month-old laptop,

00:14.806 --> 00:16.268
I mean, if anyone
should get it, it's me.

00:16.368 --> 00:17.429
I need it for my job.

00:17.529 --> 00:18.631
- Denise and
I share a computer

00:18.731 --> 00:20.033
that burns our thighs.

00:20.133 --> 00:21.715
But yeah, sure,
give it to the "writer."

00:21.815 --> 00:24.338
- Why is "writer"
always in quotes?

00:24.859 --> 00:26.120
Besides, my computer
keeps crashing.

00:26.220 --> 00:27.602
I lost an entire chapter
this morning.

00:27.702 --> 00:29.705
- Our laptop
can't be on a lap, Tom!

00:31.186 --> 00:32.809
- Weren't Mom and Dad
gonna get you a new one?

00:32.909 --> 00:34.731
- Yeah, they'd rather
buy things for their kids

00:34.831 --> 00:36.333
than actually come and visit.

00:36.433 --> 00:38.135
- Yeah, that's weird.
They're only two hours away.

00:38.235 --> 00:39.377
Think we'd get
more grandparent time.

00:39.477 --> 00:41.099
- Yeah.

00:41.199 --> 00:42.621
- Mom?

00:42.721 --> 00:44.463
- Dad?

00:44.563 --> 00:46.226
- It's not
what it looks like.

00:46.326 --> 00:48.228
- It looks like you're
visiting Connor and not us.

00:48.328 --> 00:49.630
- Why'd you say
it wasn't what it looked like?

00:49.730 --> 00:51.732
It's exactly
what it looks like.

00:58.621 --> 00:59.923
- I agree.
This is ridiculous.

01:00.023 --> 01:02.406
It's an incubator.
It's not worth those numbers.

01:02.506 --> 01:04.248
- You drove all the way
in from Sacramento

01:04.348 --> 01:05.450
and didn't even offer to visit?

01:05.550 --> 01:06.811
- I left you a voicemail.

01:06.911 --> 01:08.213
- Mom, your voicemails
are just three minutes

01:08.313 --> 01:09.455
of rustling in your purse.

01:09.555 --> 01:10.656
- I can't believe you guys

01:10.756 --> 01:11.778
are playing favorites
like this.

01:11.878 --> 01:13.380
You haven't visited
Sarah's place

01:13.480 --> 01:14.701
or my place in ages.

01:14.801 --> 01:15.903
- Yeah,
and it's so important for you

01:16.003 --> 01:17.505
to spend time
with the kids right now.

01:17.605 --> 01:18.907
I mean,
especially after last year.

01:19.007 --> 01:20.589
- Admit it, you just love
hanging out

01:20.689 --> 01:21.991
in this gigantic house.

01:22.091 --> 01:22.892
It's like a vacation
for you guys.

01:22.972 --> 01:23.953
- That's not fair.

01:24.053 --> 01:25.115
- Fresh mimosa?

01:25.215 --> 01:28.238
- Oh!
Gracias, Lupe.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.840
- De nada.

01:29.940 --> 01:31.483
- Look, we're not
playing favorites.

01:31.583 --> 01:33.565
I've never once thought
about the size of this house

01:33.665 --> 01:36.048
or this--this spectacular view

01:36.148 --> 01:38.692
that helps you forget
all your cares.

01:38.792 --> 01:40.414
- The only reason
we're babysitting Gretchen

01:40.514 --> 01:42.857
is because
Connor is extra busy.

01:42.957 --> 01:44.259
He's buying an incubator.

01:44.359 --> 01:46.261
- Mom, do you even know
what that is?

01:46.361 --> 01:47.623
- Something with eggs.

01:47.723 --> 01:49.585
- All right,
who needs a mimosa?

01:49.685 --> 01:51.307
Tom, Sarah, mimose?

01:51.407 --> 01:52.789
- Connor, how often have
they been visiting you?

01:52.889 --> 01:54.752
- [trills lips]

01:54.852 --> 01:55.953
Um...

01:56.053 --> 01:59.838
Definitely not before today.

01:59.938 --> 02:02.682
- Marshall, these are
your pants from last week.

02:02.782 --> 02:04.965
- Oh!
- Got the chocolate out.

02:05.065 --> 02:06.767
- Thank you, Lupe.
Perfect.

02:06.867 --> 02:08.850
- Mm-hmm.

02:08.950 --> 02:11.493
She made a ganache.
It's this...

02:11.593 --> 02:13.135
It's just whipped filling
of chocolate and--

02:13.235 --> 02:14.697
- Thanks for the info, Dad.

02:14.797 --> 02:17.861
- I know that Connor is
going through an adjustment,

02:17.961 --> 02:19.743
but this is not fair.

02:19.843 --> 02:21.305
Our kids wanna see
their grandparents too.

02:21.405 --> 02:23.108
- Guys, Gretchen needs

02:23.208 --> 02:25.110
extra attention
right now, okay?

02:25.210 --> 02:26.912
If you want
more grandparent time,

02:27.012 --> 02:28.594
maybe you should divorce
your wives too.

02:28.694 --> 02:29.836
- Super helpful.
- Great advice.

02:29.936 --> 02:31.198
- Thank you.

02:31.298 --> 02:32.559
- But you take them
on vacation.

02:32.659 --> 02:34.902
Your childhood bedroom
is basically a shrine.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.725
Let's face it, you've always
been the favorite.

02:36.825 --> 02:38.166
- That's not true.
Is that true?

02:38.266 --> 02:39.488
- No.
Not true.

02:39.588 --> 02:40.930
- It shifts around.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.532
- You wanna talk favorites?

02:42.632 --> 02:43.793
How about when they missed
my wrestling match

02:43.874 --> 02:44.775
for your debate club?

02:44.875 --> 02:46.177
- I wasn't in debate.

02:46.277 --> 02:48.459
That's for nerds.

02:48.559 --> 02:50.142
It was the academic quiz bowl.

02:50.242 --> 02:52.064
- And Sarah, how about
when you were 17,

02:52.164 --> 02:54.107
and they let you go
on that vacation to Colorado?

02:54.207 --> 02:56.269
- You mean
my inpatient anxiety treatment?

02:56.369 --> 02:57.711
- You told me
she was snowboarding.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.073
- I didn't want you
to worry.

02:59.173 --> 03:01.195
You were so young
and adorable.

03:01.295 --> 03:03.739
- Hey, remember
how he used to say "skissors"?

03:04.900 --> 03:06.082
- "Rock paper skissors!"

03:06.182 --> 03:08.204
- [playfully] Stop!
Stop!

03:08.304 --> 03:11.368
- Aww, sorry,
you two are upset.

03:11.468 --> 03:13.571
Look, let's balance
the scales, all right?

03:13.671 --> 03:15.053
Let's go to your places
right now.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.535
We'll make a day of it, right?

03:16.635 --> 03:18.577
- Really?
Yeah, Camila would love that.

03:18.677 --> 03:20.620
- Perfect!
Grandparent time for all!

03:20.720 --> 03:21.861
- Okay.
- Great.

03:21.961 --> 03:23.824
- You okay
with this, skissors?

03:23.924 --> 03:26.587
- I mean, no, but fine.

03:26.687 --> 03:28.109
- I get Mom.
- Sure.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.192
Okay, Mom, Dad,
do you guys mind splitting up?

03:30.292 --> 03:31.754
- Oh.
- Well, well...

03:31.854 --> 03:33.917
We've had our ups and downs,
but I mean, we--

03:34.017 --> 03:35.358
- You get to a certain age,

03:35.458 --> 03:36.880
and then you just decide
to stick with it.

03:36.980 --> 03:38.002
- Guys, that's not
what I'm--

03:38.102 --> 03:40.445
- Wait, Gramma
and Grandpa are divorcing too?

03:40.545 --> 03:42.207
- No, no.
- No, sweetie.

03:42.307 --> 03:43.849
- I'm sending you
the therapy bill.

03:43.949 --> 03:45.171
- Yeah.
- And you get the laptop.

03:45.271 --> 03:47.634
- Yes!
- Oh, damn it.

03:49.116 --> 03:50.217
- "A Wrinkle in Time"?

03:50.317 --> 03:51.579
- "Harry Potter"!

03:51.679 --> 03:53.101
- It's so great
having her here, right?

03:53.201 --> 03:55.384
- Totally. For now.

03:55.484 --> 03:56.826
- What do you mean?

03:56.926 --> 03:58.347
The kids love her.
It's grandma time!

03:58.447 --> 03:59.629
- It's not the kids
I'm worried about.

03:59.729 --> 04:01.351
You and your mom have
a 90-minute window.

04:01.451 --> 04:03.354
You get along great
for 90 minutes,

04:03.454 --> 04:05.156
and then you start to argue
and get on each other's nerves.

04:05.256 --> 04:07.239
- That is not true.

04:07.339 --> 04:08.801
How long has it been?
- Hour twenty.

04:08.901 --> 04:10.122
- Oh.

04:10.222 --> 04:11.444
- It releases insulin

04:11.544 --> 04:14.107
when your blood sugar
gets too high.

04:14.988 --> 04:20.615
And that is how
an artificial pancreas works.

04:20.715 --> 04:22.498
- I guess
this counts as playing.

04:22.598 --> 04:24.621
- Well, I mean,
he's having fun.

04:24.721 --> 04:26.182
- Say, Grandpa,
why don't you try

04:26.282 --> 04:27.384
a round of peek-a-boo?

04:27.484 --> 04:28.626
- I don't wanna mess
with their sense

04:28.726 --> 04:29.747
of object permanence.

04:29.847 --> 04:30.908
- Dad...

04:31.008 --> 04:32.510
- Oh, "Where The Wild Things
Are"!

04:32.610 --> 04:35.154
- Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!
Shamiah, you win $10!

04:35.254 --> 04:37.477
- Oh, Mom,
love the gesture,

04:37.577 --> 04:39.119
but just a heads-up:

04:39.219 --> 04:41.121
we actually donate a third
of the kids' allowance

04:41.221 --> 04:42.643
to causes that they care about,

04:42.743 --> 04:44.646
you know, renewable energy,
turtle rescue.

04:44.746 --> 04:46.728
- That's fine,
but this isn't allowance money.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.731
This is grandma bucks!
[laughs]

04:48.831 --> 04:50.773
[kids cheer]

04:50.873 --> 04:52.896
- Mom, I can't believe
that--

04:52.996 --> 04:54.899
I can't believe

04:54.999 --> 04:56.821
how much fun the kids
are having with you.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.924
- Well, thank you, Sarah.

04:59.284 --> 05:00.906
- I mean,
I wanna be wrong.

05:01.006 --> 05:02.869
- Hey, Marina,
what percentile

05:02.969 --> 05:04.351
head circumference are they?

05:04.451 --> 05:06.393
I'm guessing Es-ta-ban's
a couple of points bigger.

05:06.493 --> 05:07.715
- Esteban.

05:07.815 --> 05:09.157
- Sorry,
what did I say?

05:09.257 --> 05:10.799
- Also, you're pointing
at Alejandro.

05:10.899 --> 05:12.921
- You sure?
'Cause I'm really getting

05:13.021 --> 05:15.885
an Ees-ta-ban vibe
from this one.

05:15.985 --> 05:17.006
- You know, Sarah,
this place would feel

05:17.106 --> 05:18.168
a lot less cramped

05:18.268 --> 05:19.770
if you would put
some of this stuff away.

05:19.870 --> 05:22.453
- Okay, well, I do, but--

05:22.553 --> 05:23.855
- You were always
the messy one.

05:23.955 --> 05:26.198
- And you always
reminded me.

05:26.919 --> 05:30.063
I wonder if Tom and Marina
are having this much "fun"

05:30.163 --> 05:32.165
with Dad.
[hushed] Please stop that.

05:32.806 --> 05:34.669
- Guys, can I watch
the game in your room?

05:34.769 --> 05:35.790
- Yeah, if you're here now,

05:35.890 --> 05:36.992
why don't you play a game
with Camila?

05:37.092 --> 05:38.473
- Ah, way ahead of ya.

05:38.573 --> 05:40.276
I already have set her up
for online poker.

05:40.376 --> 05:41.678
- Love you, Grandpa!

05:41.778 --> 05:43.480
- Love you too, baby.
Hey, don't go all-in

05:43.580 --> 05:45.683
unless you got
the nuts, sweetheart.

05:45.783 --> 05:47.325
- You can't do
"Black Lives Matter"

05:47.425 --> 05:49.167
in charades!
It is offensive!

05:49.267 --> 05:50.609
- How is that offensive?

05:50.709 --> 05:51.850
- Why the trumpet?

05:51.950 --> 05:53.132
- Because Louis Armstrong
was Black!

05:53.232 --> 05:54.293
- Oh, my God, Mom.

05:54.393 --> 05:56.416
- Stop criticizing Grandma!

05:56.516 --> 05:58.018
Tell us who else was Black.

05:58.118 --> 06:00.501
- If you need me,
I'll be on your bed.

06:00.601 --> 06:02.023
- And if you need me,

06:02.123 --> 06:04.606
I will listening to a podcast
about murder.

06:05.367 --> 06:07.530
- 90 minutes on the dot.
I should write a book.

06:10.454 --> 06:11.715
- What up?

06:11.815 --> 06:13.598
- Hey, how's
it going with Dad?

06:13.698 --> 06:16.722
- It's great.
It's... so great.

06:16.822 --> 06:18.163
We're having the best time.

06:18.263 --> 06:21.127
- I can't help you
if you keep crying like this.

06:21.227 --> 06:22.409
- How's it going with Mom?

06:22.509 --> 06:24.572
- Sarah, were these walls
painted this color

06:24.672 --> 06:27.075
when you moved in?
I can't picture choosing it.

06:28.356 --> 06:30.579
- She's so good
with the kids.

06:30.679 --> 06:31.981
- Totally.
It's like, grandparent time

06:32.081 --> 06:33.623
is the best, right?

06:33.723 --> 06:36.146
- Speaking of, Camila
deserves some grandma time,

06:36.246 --> 06:38.349
so I thought I could drop her
off at your place.

06:38.449 --> 06:40.512
- Oh, okay, you know,

06:40.612 --> 06:42.794
actually, I was thinking
we could bring Dad to you.

06:42.894 --> 06:44.136
You know, he could do
some science experiments

06:44.216 --> 06:46.759
with Kelvin and Shamiah.
That'd be fun, right?

06:46.859 --> 06:47.961
Well, you're
trying to pass her off on me.

06:48.061 --> 06:49.883
- You're trying
to pass him off on me

06:49.983 --> 06:51.325
Okay, fine,

06:51.425 --> 06:52.967
Mom is starting to annoy me
a little bit.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.329
- Dad's supposed to be
taking care of the kids,

06:54.429 --> 06:56.852
but we're taking care of him.

06:56.952 --> 06:58.654
We were so jealous
that Connor was the favorite,

06:58.754 --> 07:01.378
we forgot what it's actually
like when Mom and Dad visit.

07:01.478 --> 07:03.220
[cell phone buzzes]
Oh, and here's

07:03.320 --> 07:04.622
their favorite child now.
hang on.

07:04.722 --> 07:05.783
- Hey.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.025
How's it going
with Mom and Dad?

07:07.125 --> 07:09.148
- It's, like, the best.

07:09.248 --> 07:10.670
- My heart is so full.

07:10.770 --> 07:12.552
- Good.
Then you're gonna love this.

07:12.652 --> 07:15.355
So I felt bad about hogging
all the grandparent time.

07:15.455 --> 07:16.837

I gotta go do
more bathroom stuff.

14:55.635 --> 14:58.298
- When Conny has to go,
he really has to go.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.940
- Yeah,
he gets it from me.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.483
One clam, I am done-zo.

15:03.605 --> 15:05.147
- Oh, crikey!

15:05.247 --> 15:07.430
Well, if that's the case,

15:07.530 --> 15:09.913
I guess I must raise
my bid as well!

15:10.013 --> 15:12.156
I simply must own
that apartment,

15:12.256 --> 15:14.278
which is what we here
in South Kensington

15:14.378 --> 15:16.882
call a "flat."

15:16.982 --> 15:18.163
- Gee, I hope
this works out.

15:18.263 --> 15:19.405
- Yeah.
- It's a great idea

15:19.505 --> 15:20.767
from Connor.
- Yeah.

15:20.867 --> 15:22.289
- Another great idea
from Connor.

15:22.389 --> 15:25.132
- Oh, Tommy,
who cares whose idea it was?

15:25.232 --> 15:26.814
This could be
a wonderful place.

15:26.914 --> 15:28.136
The kids could sleep over.

15:28.236 --> 15:30.299
We can put their artwork
on that wall over there,

15:30.399 --> 15:31.901
like Shamiah's watercolors.

15:32.001 --> 15:33.062
- Aw, Mom.

15:33.162 --> 15:35.866
- Tommy, I'm thinking...

15:35.966 --> 15:37.348
we could use the top shelf

15:37.448 --> 15:39.991
on these built-ins
to display all your novels.

15:40.091 --> 15:41.633
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.475
And then, down here,
we'd put John Grisham.

15:43.575 --> 15:46.199
- You'd put me
above Grisham?

15:46.299 --> 15:49.082
- Absolutely.
Mur and I are so proud of you.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.804
- I brag about you
on Facebook.

15:50.904 --> 15:52.927
There's a special emoji
for books.

15:53.027 --> 15:54.249
It's like a little pile
of books.

15:54.349 --> 15:56.171
- Yeah, and you too,
Sarah.

15:56.271 --> 15:57.693
You have got
such a great heart.

15:57.793 --> 15:59.255
- Yeah.

15:59.355 --> 16:01.618
- I have no idea
where that came from.

16:01.718 --> 16:04.542
I, myself, have not volunteered
since Hands Across America.

16:04.642 --> 16:05.743
- That's right.

16:05.843 --> 16:07.866
- Wow, we always
just assumed

16:07.966 --> 16:09.508
that Connor was the favorite.

16:09.608 --> 16:11.551
- Yeah, he's got all the money,
you know, he's the baby.

16:11.651 --> 16:13.473
I mean, how can
we compete with that?

16:13.573 --> 16:14.875
- Well, he is the baby.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.118
But that only means
he needs us more.

16:17.218 --> 16:19.080
We love all of you equally.

16:19.180 --> 16:20.682
And that goes
for you two as well.

16:20.782 --> 16:21.924
- Oh.
- We are delighted

16:22.024 --> 16:23.886
to have you both
as daughters-in-law.

16:23.986 --> 16:26.069
- Well, thank you, Dad.

16:27.390 --> 16:29.333
- And I am very proud

16:29.433 --> 16:31.255
to share the Hayworth name
with you both.

16:31.355 --> 16:33.739
- That is so sweet,
honestly.

16:33.839 --> 16:36.302
But you know, Sarah and I
created our own last name.

16:36.402 --> 16:38.224
- Yeah, I don't understand
that, so...

16:38.324 --> 16:40.187
Okay, bring it in.
Come on.

16:40.287 --> 16:41.548
Ah!
- Oh!

16:41.648 --> 16:42.750
- Okay.

16:42.850 --> 16:44.112
Come on, everybody.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.755
- Yeah.
[laughter]

16:46.855 --> 16:49.198
- Oh, that feels good.

16:49.298 --> 16:51.201
- Yeah.
Let's check on Rachel,

16:51.301 --> 16:53.403
see what's going on.

16:53.503 --> 16:55.506
- [softly] Okay.

16:56.787 --> 16:58.089
- So--
- Yeah...

16:58.189 --> 17:00.292
- I mean...
- Yeah...

17:00.392 --> 17:01.814
- I told you guys

17:01.914 --> 17:02.915
it might be a good idea
to have them closer.

17:02.995 --> 17:04.097
- Oh, please.
- You were just as much

17:04.197 --> 17:05.899
a part of this as we were.
Please.

17:05.999 --> 17:07.301
- You know what?
The kids would love it,

17:07.401 --> 17:10.124
and we might like it too.

17:12.848 --> 17:14.310
- Oh my god, Connor!

17:14.410 --> 17:16.152
- Hey, Connor?
Buddy?

17:16.252 --> 17:17.834
Are you almost done in there?

17:17.934 --> 17:19.236
- Almost!

17:19.336 --> 17:20.798
- No really, whatever
you're doing in there,

17:20.898 --> 17:22.560
you need to hit pause, okay?

17:22.660 --> 17:24.883
- Just one second!
I'm actually using it now!

17:24.983 --> 17:27.086
[toilet flushes]

17:27.186 --> 17:28.407
- So it's over?

17:28.507 --> 17:29.769
- I'm so sorry.

17:29.869 --> 17:31.651
The other buyer
wired a down payment.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.133
I think he's Dutch.

17:33.233 --> 17:34.896
- [bad British accent]
The loo is all yours, Tom.

17:34.996 --> 17:36.938
- Excuse me, guys.
I have to call my office.

17:37.038 --> 17:38.660
I'm so sorry.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.664
- Well, this has been
a roller coaster kind of a day.

17:41.764 --> 17:43.306
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

17:43.406 --> 17:45.409
- Oh, hey, Tommy,
it's not your fault.

17:45.929 --> 17:47.932
- Well...

17:48.372 --> 17:49.714
- You guys are doing
a really good job

17:49.814 --> 17:50.956
of acting upset.

17:51.056 --> 17:52.237
- We are upset.

17:52.337 --> 17:54.440
- Yeah, wow,
very convincing.

17:54.540 --> 17:57.244
- Maybe you could find them
another place nearby?

17:57.344 --> 17:59.346
- Yeah, totally.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.048
Why are we still going
with this?

18:01.148 --> 18:02.250
What is this, like, a bit?

18:02.350 --> 18:04.212
- Well, I guess
we just kind of realized

18:04.312 --> 18:08.258
that we've always got room
for ice cream, you know.

18:08.358 --> 18:09.900
- What?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.982
After all this,
now you guys love ice cream?

18:12.082 --> 18:14.465
- Okay, we always loved
ice cream.

18:14.565 --> 18:16.348
We just lost sight
of the whole ice cream picture.

18:16.448 --> 18:17.749
- Look, Connor, we just had

18:17.849 --> 18:19.512
a really heartfelt encounter
with ice cream.

18:19.612 --> 18:20.753
- Oh, yeah?

18:20.853 --> 18:21.995
Well, while you guys
were out here,

18:22.095 --> 18:24.318
having an emotional
breakthrough about ice cream,

18:24.418 --> 18:25.840
I'm in the bathroom

18:25.940 --> 18:28.924
dropping a ridiculous amount
of money on cones!

18:29.024 --> 18:31.246
- But here you
all go again.

18:31.346 --> 18:33.289
Can you stop arguing for once?

18:33.389 --> 18:34.451
- Mom,
this doesn't concern you.

18:34.551 --> 18:36.333
- They keep changing
their stance on a dessert.

18:36.433 --> 18:38.776
- Oh, please!
- Okay, oh, ho, ho, ho.

18:38.876 --> 18:40.658
Mur, I think it's time
we headed on home.

18:40.758 --> 18:41.980
- Yeah, I think
it's that time.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.181
- "That time"?
What time?

18:43.281 --> 18:44.784
- There comes a time

18:44.884 --> 18:50.230
in which the five of you
start to become a lot.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.593
- Oh, us.
We're a lot.

18:52.693 --> 18:54.356
- We can be a lot?

18:54.456 --> 18:55.837
- What happened
to all that stuff

18:55.937 --> 18:57.199
about being proud of us?

18:57.299 --> 18:58.961
- Well, we are.
But, all of this--this--

18:59.061 --> 19:02.286
- Maybe moving closer together
isn't a great idea.

19:02.386 --> 19:03.968
We'll just drive up
on the weekends.

19:04.068 --> 19:05.850
- Yeah,
let me explain it this way.

19:05.950 --> 19:09.615
I love hamburgers.
I'm a big hamburger guy.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.217
But if I had to eat
a hamburger--

19:11.317 --> 19:13.059
- You know what, Dad?
Dad, we get it.

19:13.159 --> 19:16.183
- Okay, people,
this place is off the market.

19:16.283 --> 19:17.905
You are officially trespassing.

19:18.005 --> 19:21.049
Now, you don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

19:23.172 --> 19:24.514
- I never trusted her.

19:24.614 --> 19:26.196
In the Hayworth family,

19:26.296 --> 19:27.998
everyone liked ice cream.

19:28.098 --> 19:29.880
But they agreed
that sometimes,

19:29.980 --> 19:31.242
the best ice cream...

19:31.342 --> 19:33.405
- Like I said,
negative energy.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.646
- Is the kind you have
to drive

19:34.746 --> 19:35.808
two hours away to get.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.191
- Bollocks.
Just lost a lot of quid.

19:39.632 --> 19:42.156
Hey, quid means money,
right, in British?

19:45.560 --> 19:46.801
- So there were actually
no murders in the building?

19:46.882 --> 19:48.784
- I mean, I kind of
assume there's been murders

19:48.884 --> 19:50.887
everywhere at some point
or another.

19:52.569 --> 19:55.292
- I mean, I am feeling
negative energy here.

19:56.013 --> 19:58.076
- [RP accent] Sorry to hear
about the flats, old chap.

19:58.176 --> 20:00.679
[normally] Maybe you can find
a way to back out of the deal.

20:00.779 --> 20:02.121
- Nah, my Zillow buddy
told me

20:02.221 --> 20:03.883
that they're putting in
a new development,

20:03.983 --> 20:07.127
like two blocks away,
some high-end outdoor mall

20:07.227 --> 20:09.050
with, like, a pan-Asian
night market.

20:09.150 --> 20:11.893
So in a year, that place will
be worth twice what I paid.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.495
- So we made
a huge mistake,

20:13.595 --> 20:14.897
and you're still
making a profit.

20:14.997 --> 20:16.459
- Funny
how that works, huh?

20:16.559 --> 20:17.981
- Yeah.
- Well, I don't know.

20:18.081 --> 20:19.663
Maybe since
we came up with the idea,

20:19.763 --> 20:23.187
we could be considered, like,
co-financers of the thing?

20:23.287 --> 20:25.230
- Oh, Tom, that's why you
gotta put things in writing.

20:25.330 --> 20:26.632
Business 101, man.

20:26.732 --> 20:28.154
- But--

20:28.254 --> 20:30.256
- [laughs]
