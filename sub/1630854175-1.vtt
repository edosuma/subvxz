Whew!

00:21.189 --> 00:22.156
But I'm gonna tell you something.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.424
You should not be here.

00:23.457 --> 00:27.328
You should be out at a bar,

not coming with me

00:30.098 --> 00:31.932

Hannah, I'm flattered,
but that's wildly inappropriate.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.726
What?
No, not you, Miss Clark.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.361
I'm talking about
Vampire Cop.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.462
Oh, Lord.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.597
I just loved you
so much on that show.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.133
Is there any chance
that they're gonna reboot it?

01:05.166 --> 01:07.268
Oh, well, I don't know.
Not with me.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.869

are over.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.274
Miss Clark here.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.809
That's right.
So everybody relax.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.411

any of this!

02:50.571 --> 02:53.006
So, your first day
as an FBI agent.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.476
You nervous?
No.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.744
Yeah, a little.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.515
The dream is
no longer deferred.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.485
Mm-hmm. On top of that,
you set the bar pretty high

03:04.518 --> 03:06.420
the last time
you were here.

03:06.454 --> 03:09.557
Question is, will the Bureau
give you credit for it,

03:09.590 --> 03:11.091
or are they gonna
make you prove yourself

03:11.124 --> 03:12.760
all over again?

03:12.793 --> 03:15.229
Garza will, I think.

03:15.263 --> 03:17.097

03:17.130 --> 03:19.533
there's no resting

03:44.091 --> 03:45.359
But we're leaving here
with what we came for.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.695
And when we're done,
you'll be dead.

03:47.728 --> 03:52.199
The only question is, are you
gonna give us what we want,

03:52.232 --> 03:54.134
or are we gonna
have to kill them, too?

right into the office.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.972
Ha, ha.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.841
What, you worried
about me

04:33.874 --> 04:35.809
cramping your style
with the ladies?

04:35.843 --> 04:37.044
It's not about
the ladies.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.982
It's a little
about the ladies,

04:42.015 --> 04:46.286
but it's mostly about the kind
of work I do in the community.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.189
Meaning, how are you gonna
represent police reform

04:49.222 --> 04:51.525
when you got the police
in your home?

04:51.559 --> 04:52.793
Exactly.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.628
Okay, well,
you just tell them

04:54.662 --> 04:56.864
that I'm working
in a brand-new unit,

04:56.897 --> 05:00.167
and I'm gonna reform the FBI
from the inside.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.804
So, how was D.C.?

05:03.837 --> 05:05.839
Frustrating.
I bet.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.475
You know, can I just say
I'm kind of flattered

05:07.508 --> 05:09.042
you went all the way out there
to complain about me?

05:09.076 --> 05:10.944
Uh-huh.
Don't be cute.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.279
This special unit of yours

05:12.312 --> 05:14.348
is counter to the entire
FBI ethos.

05:14.382 --> 05:17.150
Exactly, Tracy.
The Bureau needs an upgrade.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.952
Less process,
more police work.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.554
How do you think
it's going in there?

05:20.588 --> 05:22.222
You're the people expert.

05:22.255 --> 05:25.025
I'm a profiler,
not a body-language specialist.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.562
Wouldn't take a specialist
to read that.

05:28.596 --> 05:31.799
Tracy, please, the Bureau
needs a rapid-response unit

05:31.832 --> 05:33.467
that can jump in
on fast-moving cases.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.302
I really wish
you wouldn't see

05:35.335 --> 05:37.070
what I'm trying to do
as such a threat.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.472
Well, I might be
a little less concerned

05:38.506 --> 05:40.207
if you hadn't picked
Laura and Carter.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.475
They are outside-the-box
thinkers,

05:41.509 --> 05:43.677
and they are experts
in their fields.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.245
They're a hot mess.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.548
Laura melted down at BSU,

05:47.581 --> 05:48.916
and Carter can't stay
out of his own way.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.218
And why on Earth

05:51.251 --> 05:53.887
would you be stepping in
on a murder case

05:53.921 --> 05:55.389
LAPD just caught?

05:55.423 --> 05:56.657
Because I have a feeling
there's more to it.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.058
Oh, <i>feeling</i>

05:58.091 --> 06:00.093
is not an FBI
investigative method.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.229
And yet they helped me
catch a Russian terrorist.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.766
You know...

06:05.799 --> 06:08.536
there's a flip side to this
big swing of yours, Matt.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.371
If your unit screws up
in any way,

06:11.405 --> 06:12.640
I will shut it down.

06:14.642 --> 06:17.377
We done?

06:17.411 --> 06:18.479
Yeah.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.193
New blood.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.763
Brendon Acres?
Ah, yes, ma'am.

06:35.796 --> 06:36.930
Are you
my training agent?

06:36.964 --> 06:38.899
Laura Stensen.
This is Agent Carter Hope.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.033
You'll be working with us

06:40.067 --> 06:41.268
in the Special
Investigative Unit.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.804
Does that mean
I'm <i>your</i> rookie?

06:43.837 --> 06:45.473
Simone Clark. No.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.641
I think you're assigned
to the Background Check Unit.

06:47.675 --> 06:51.545
I think <i>not.</i>
Has to be a mi-- mista--

06:51.579 --> 06:54.915
Hey.
Hey, Agent Garza.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.316
Looking good.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.385
Uh,
there's some confusion.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.220
I'm supposed to be assigned
to your unit.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.255
No, no, there's no confusion, Simone.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.290
Let's get to work.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.125
W-- But, sir, I...

07:05.158 --> 07:07.461
Background Unit's
down the hall and to the left.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.636
So, where are we going?

07:15.669 --> 07:16.837
Overflow building.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.639
It's where they keep
the misfit toys.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.008
It's where they keep
the computer servers.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.510
It's where Garza set us up
to keep us out

07:22.543 --> 07:23.811
from under the eye
of the big boss.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.913
All right, we've got a case.
Elena!

07:25.946 --> 07:27.848
What did we discuss
about the yelling?

07:27.881 --> 07:29.583
It's not yelling.
It's exuberance.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.184
Did LAPD send over
the initial case file?

07:31.218 --> 07:32.653
Yes, it's uploaded
in the fishbowl.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.822
Fishbowl?
No, I prefer briefing room.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.124
And I prefer sleeping in,
but my uncle's all hung up

07:37.157 --> 07:39.827
on this "normal business hours"
thing.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.029
Whoa.
Hi. I'm Elena.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.296
Brendon.
Oh, I know.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.599
I've seen every episode
of "Vampire Cop."

07:45.633 --> 07:47.300
Almost didn't recognize you
with your shirt on, though.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.174
Our victim's name
is Roger Kynard.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.710
LAPD responded to a 911 call
this morning

07:56.744 --> 07:59.212
after the Kynard family
arrived home from Catalina

07:59.246 --> 08:00.714
and found his body.

08:00.748 --> 08:03.517
Now, as you can see by
the initial crime-scene photos,

08:03.551 --> 08:06.453
Mr. Kynard was beaten
pretty badly before he died.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.657
The working theory is
a home invasion that ended ugly.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.859
But you disagree, otherwise
we wouldn't be talking about it.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.561
Well, Mr. Kynard
was the assistant director

08:13.594 --> 08:16.396
of the Federal Facilities
Management Department.

08:16.429 --> 08:19.132
He oversaw retrofits
for all federal buildings.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.702
<i>All?</i>
Including, like, the Pentagon?

08:21.735 --> 08:23.571
And the White House.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.473
So go find out who killed
this guy, because I'm worried

08:26.506 --> 08:28.408
he's connected
to something <i>much</i> scarier.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.848
Hey, everybody.

08:34.882 --> 08:38.586
Agent Clark,
you're late.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.853
Well, yeah,
I-I'm sorry.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.689
I was, uh, just talking
to Agent Garza.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.557
That's no excuse.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.192
You'll be doing
background checks

08:45.225 --> 08:47.695
on potential
federal employees.

08:47.728 --> 08:51.531
Well, I hope that involves
a lot of field interviews.

08:51.565 --> 08:55.535
No, this is purely a desk job.
Files and phone calls.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.371
And I expect you
to clear a dozen a day.

08:58.405 --> 09:01.742
That's nothing.
I can do this in my sleep.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.510
This guy looks all right.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.178
Eh, iffy.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.580
We like her.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.248
Oh! Ding, ding.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.617
This guy's gonna be
a problem.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.119
How could you possibly
know that with one look?

09:12.152 --> 09:14.622
Simple. I read thousands
of student files

09:14.655 --> 09:16.023
when I was
a guidance counselor,

09:16.056 --> 09:17.691
and I got really good
at this game

09:17.725 --> 09:20.427
I like to call
"What doesn't belong here?"

09:20.460 --> 09:23.430
See, this candidate,
Micah Olsen--

09:23.463 --> 09:27.400
he was a chemical engineer in
Denver for damn near a decade,

09:27.434 --> 09:31.605
but he's applying to be
a janitor in El Paso?

09:31.639 --> 09:35.943
In my experience, drastic change
equals a person in crisis.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.378
Really?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.580
'Cause I'm talking
to a middle-aged woman

09:40.614 --> 09:42.616
who abandoned her life
and moved across the country

09:42.650 --> 09:44.551
to join the FBI.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.554
Are you saying I should be
worried that you're in crisis?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.857
Okay, I see what
you did there.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.761
Files and phone calls,
Agent Clark.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.695
But I--
Get to work.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.234
We're underwater with
security clearance requests

10:01.268 --> 10:03.470
from local law
and elected officials.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.505
Every unit is expected
to clear their backlog...

10:05.538 --> 10:07.340
Agent Garza, I need to
speak with you for just--

10:07.374 --> 10:08.842
You're not supposed
to be in here.

10:08.876 --> 10:11.311
I know. I'm <i>supposed</i> to be
in your unit, and--

10:11.344 --> 10:13.280
Okay, outside.
Outside. Outside.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.987
This is why.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.521
I'm sorry?

10:21.554 --> 10:24.124
This is why I didn't have you
assigned to my unit.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.193
Because I'm
an outside-the-box thinker

10:26.226 --> 10:28.095
who's passionate
about making a difference?

10:28.128 --> 10:30.197
No, because you're a torpedo
looking for a target,

10:30.230 --> 10:31.932
and I can't afford
for it to be my unit.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.701
A unit that you were
empowered to launch

10:33.734 --> 10:35.368
because <i>I</i> helped you
catch a terrorist.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.004
I know that, Simone,
I do.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.372
This was <i>not</i>
an easy decision to make.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.041
But I'm walking
a tightrope here.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.109
I'm trying to
change things up

10:42.142 --> 10:43.476
in a place
that doesn't do change,

10:43.510 --> 10:45.178
so I need
outside-the-box thinkers

10:45.212 --> 10:46.513
who know how
to keep things low-key,

10:46.546 --> 10:49.049
and we both know
that's not you.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.785
I-I can't apologize for being
my own advocate.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.287
In a world that marginalizes you
at every turn,

10:54.321 --> 10:56.156
it's--
it's who you gotta be.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.225
But I hear you.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.660
I just need to
prove myself worthy again.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.029
I'm on it.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.331
No. No, no, no, Simone,
that's-- that--

11:04.364 --> 11:07.167
that is not the takeaway.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.973
What are you wearing?

11:13.006 --> 11:15.642
Uh, it's a Ted Baker.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.078
No, no, no.
I didn't ask who.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.882
That suit might look good
on a red carpet,

11:21.915 --> 11:24.084
but it's not appropriate
for the field.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.152
Too stylish?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.920
Too tight.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.560
So, why'd you look away
from the crime-scene photos?

11:33.593 --> 11:35.428
What? No.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.431
New guy, the biggest sin
in the Bureau is lying.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.402
I spent six years
covered in blood--

11:42.435 --> 11:44.704
the fake blood
as a vampire cop.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.574
I-I-- I have some PTSD
about it.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.943
No, you don't.

11:49.977 --> 11:53.013
PTSD is caused
by real trauma.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.715
What you're describing sounds
more like an aversion reaction,

11:55.749 --> 11:59.586
and you're gonna need
to get over it.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.288
Fast.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.623
You'll be seeing a hell of
a lot of blood in this job.

12:05.425 --> 12:09.629
Officer.
Special Agent Hope, FBI.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.564
Can you give me a rundown
on what you found so far?

12:11.598 --> 12:14.067
Sure. Uh...

12:14.101 --> 12:15.869
"Crime sucks."

12:15.903 --> 12:17.905
Oh.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.740
The tagline
for "Vampire Cop."

12:21.741 --> 12:23.476
Is this gonna
happen a lot?

12:23.510 --> 12:26.446
Probably, although my fans
tend to skew a little younger.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.282
Do not puke in here.

12:29.316 --> 12:32.052
Please, I'm not gonna--

12:32.085 --> 12:34.121
Oh.
Geez.

12:35.655 --> 12:38.291
Yeah,
it's an aversion reaction.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.827
No, it's a problem.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.062
Yeah.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.430
Do you think you could
get him to sign this?

12:43.463 --> 12:44.731
Are you serious
right now?

12:49.702 --> 12:52.639
<i>Hey, Simone.
This is a bad time.</i>

12:52.672 --> 12:55.108
Tough.
I need a pep talk.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.810
Why are you
in the bushes?

12:56.844 --> 12:59.312
Because I almost threw up
at the crime scene.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.848
<i>What's the crime
you're investigating?</i>

13:00.881 --> 13:02.515
<i>Did you catch a murder?</i>

13:02.549 --> 13:05.585
Guy with oversight over all the
federal buildings was murdered.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.587
Someone beat the hell out of him
before they shot him.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.690
So it sounds like they tortured
him to get the information,

13:10.723 --> 13:12.592
then killed him
once they got it.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.161
Who found the body?

13:14.194 --> 13:16.964
His family,
when they got home from a trip.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.499
It's probably what
tipped the scales for him.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.034
<i>He talked to keep them
out of harm's way.</i>

13:23.070 --> 13:25.372
Brendon, who's that guy
peeping behind you?

13:25.405 --> 13:26.940
<i>He--
He could be a witness.</i>

13:26.974 --> 13:28.541
Oh. Hey.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.944
Uh, excuse me, sir. FBI.
Can I talk to you for--

13:30.978 --> 13:32.712
Or the killer!

13:32.745 --> 13:34.581
Hey, we got a runner!

13:35.883 --> 13:37.217
Get him, B!

13:37.250 --> 13:38.385
<i>I'm running.
I'm gonna get him.</i>

13:40.753 --> 13:42.255

14:13.053 --> 14:14.521
<i>Why'd you run,

14:14.554 --> 14:18.358
I was squatting in the house--
house next door.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.161
I'm the kind of guy cops look at
when things go bad.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.695
Well, to be fair,
your criminal record

14:22.729 --> 14:24.764
has an impressive amount
of diversity.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.733
But no real violence.

14:26.766 --> 14:30.403
So we're giving you an
opportunity to help us out here.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.439
You mean, did--

14:32.472 --> 14:35.108
did I hear my neighbor
get murdered?

14:35.142 --> 14:36.576
No comment.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.378
I don't-- I don't want nothin'
to do with those guys.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.080
Which guys?

14:42.415 --> 14:44.251
You need to do
the right thing here, Tom.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.523
I-I really only saw
one of them, okay?

14:50.557 --> 14:51.925
Young guy.

14:51.959 --> 14:54.294
Red hair.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.596
Had-- Had a-a blue-devil tattoo
on his forearm.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.201
Did you get past
the firewall yet?

15:01.234 --> 15:03.370
Sure did.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.039
I'm downloading the data
to a thumb drive.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.108
Good man.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.910
Gonna be a shame to have to
roll without you.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.045
What?

15:12.079 --> 15:15.082
Aah!
Somehow the Feds made you.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.483
They just put out
a city-wide BOLO

15:16.516 --> 15:18.318
with a pretty good description.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.552
They don't know
your name yet,

15:19.586 --> 15:21.254
but they'll figure
that out.

15:21.288 --> 15:24.657
And this job is just too
important to let you jam us up.

15:32.966 --> 15:33.900
On the plus side,
you've made a positive impact

15:35.668 --> 15:37.070
on a major case.

15:37.104 --> 15:40.173
Yeah, and shown my hind-quarters
to my training agent.

15:40.207 --> 15:43.243
So what?
You did that all over TV.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.346
Hell, there's like, what,
eight or nine Cliptalk accounts

15:46.379 --> 15:48.448
dedicated to
your bedonkadonk.

15:48.481 --> 15:51.851
Meanwhile, my ass is parked
in FBI purgatory.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.924
Hey, cute thing.
How you doin'?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.292
Can't complain.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.161
You're assigned
to Garza's squad, right?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.096
That's what Nolan
told me.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.631
He did, did he?

16:04.664 --> 16:05.932
<i>Yep, what's up?</i>

16:05.965 --> 16:08.201
We've got a guy named
Heath Radnor in lockup.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.637
Picked him up a couple days ago
on a parole violation.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.340
And fun fact-- his file
mentions a known associate

16:13.373 --> 16:15.275
with a blue-devil tattoo,

16:15.308 --> 16:16.843
like the one
on your BOLO suspect.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.811
Sounds like a guy
we should talk to.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.180
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

16:20.213 --> 16:22.615
Are you free to come over,
or should I call Garza?

16:22.649 --> 16:25.518
No, no, no.
I'll be there in 20.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.220
Be where in 20?

16:27.254 --> 16:28.855
Lunch.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.890
Ooh!

16:30.923 --> 16:32.125
Found a winner.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.329
Who are you?

16:36.363 --> 16:39.299
Simone Clark, FBI.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.833
And the fact
that I'm here

16:40.867 --> 16:42.402
should scare the hell
out of you.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.903
Baby, I'm already
looking at five years

16:43.936 --> 16:45.305
for a parole violation.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.040
It's gonna take a lot
to scare me.

16:47.074 --> 16:50.477
Mm. How about
first-degree murder, boo?

16:50.510 --> 16:53.880
See, one of your known
associates just killed a guy.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.348
Yeah?

16:55.382 --> 16:56.983
I don't know nothing
about that.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.718
Really? 'Cause when we searched
your phone a few minutes ago,

16:58.751 --> 17:01.588
we found the victim's address
in your search history.

17:01.621 --> 17:05.592
See, I think you were supposed
to be a part of this crime,

17:05.625 --> 17:07.894
only LAPD
snatched you up.

17:07.927 --> 17:10.663
But we can still charge you
as an accessory

17:10.697 --> 17:14.067
unless you tell us
every damn thing you know.

17:14.101 --> 17:17.270
Look, I didn't know
they were gonna kill anyone.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.005
Tristan asked me
to scope out the house,

17:19.038 --> 17:20.540
report back
on the alarm system.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.409
Didn't even tell me
who he was crewed up with.

17:22.442 --> 17:23.943
I swear to God.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.678
What's Tristan's
last name?

17:25.712 --> 17:27.214
Hughes.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.582
Well, so far
we've struck out.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.085
The blue-devil tat isn't
in the federal database.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.753
I have Brendon running
a social-media search,

17:33.786 --> 17:35.788
but it's a long shot.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.724
His name's
Tristan Hughes.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.794
How the hell
do you know that?

17:41.828 --> 17:42.862
Promise not to get mad?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.597
No. Tell me now.

17:44.631 --> 17:48.067
O-Okay. I interviewed
a person of interest

17:48.101 --> 17:50.737
in your homicide
through a contact I had at LAPD.

17:50.770 --> 17:54.707
But before your head explodes,
all right, just consider

17:54.741 --> 17:58.745
that every fiber of my being
wanted to lone-wolf this thing.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.381
I wanted to hunt Tristan down
and bring him in myself

18:01.414 --> 18:03.483
so I could prove
I belonged in your unit.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.653
But that is what
a torpedo would do.

18:06.686 --> 18:10.557
And I'm a team player who shares
all the information she has

18:10.590 --> 18:13.360
and waits for instructions
on how to proceed next.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.164
So how should
I proceed next?

18:18.431 --> 18:21.067
Can I just say,
this is a fascinating case

18:21.100 --> 18:22.969
of behavioral dysregulation.

18:23.002 --> 18:26.239
Please, can I work up a profile
on her <i>before</i> you fire her?

18:26.273 --> 18:28.775
Why would he fire her?
She found our guy.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.844
Tristan Hughes, 22.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.780
Several arrests for minor
crimes, but no jail time

18:33.813 --> 18:35.448
and no known
current address.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.284
Where did he go
to high school?

18:37.317 --> 18:38.651
Why?

18:38.685 --> 18:40.920
Because the one thing
all criminals have in common

18:40.953 --> 18:42.689
is that they all
went to high school.

18:42.722 --> 18:43.990
Arden High.

18:44.023 --> 18:46.493
Agent Garza, I belong
to a national network

18:46.526 --> 18:47.927
of guidance counselors.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.129
If you give me an hour,

18:50.163 --> 18:52.199
I bet I can get
an address for Tristan.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.767
A League of Extraordinary
Guidance Counselors?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.503
How cool is that?

18:56.536 --> 18:58.271
Say yes.
Say no.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.373
Agent Clark.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.509
You have 30 seconds
to explain

19:02.542 --> 19:05.678
why you have
abandoned your post.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.013
<i>Please</i> let me help you.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.716
Please.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.221
Oliver, it's my fault.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.122
Simone was running down
a lead for me.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.690
I'll need her
for the rest of the day.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.659
You'll have her back tomorrow.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.561
But I

19:21.594 --> 19:24.163
I am happy to help, sir.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.933
You can't just poach
my people.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.636
He's right.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.638
And you can't reward this one
for breaking the rules, either.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.241
I can if I think it'll help us
catch our killers

19:34.274 --> 19:36.075
and stop whatever else
they're planning.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.877
Go get me that address.
And, you, go with her.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.178
What? No.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.647
She needs discipline, Carter.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.549
And that's your... speciality.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.754
Let's go.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.856
Can I drive?
No.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.259
We're looking
for Tristan Hughes.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.526
We need you
to show us his file.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.395
I'm sorry.

19:55.428 --> 19:59.031
He left his manners
in his other suit.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.066
You work with
a lot of kids.

20:00.099 --> 20:02.201
Do you even remember
Tristan?

20:02.235 --> 20:04.170
A little.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.005
He graduated
four years ago.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.107
Any friends who may know
where he is now?

20:08.140 --> 20:10.243
His brother
still goes here.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.782
Joshua.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.149
I need you for a minute.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.119
I thought he didn't have
any family.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.589
She means
group-home brother.

20:22.622 --> 20:28.027
Joshua, this is Agent Hope
and Agent Clark with the FBI.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.029
They're looking
for Tristan.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.399
I-I haven't seen him.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.700
You're lying.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.602
And that's okay,

20:35.635 --> 20:37.904
because if the Feds
came looking for my family,

20:37.937 --> 20:39.606
I would probably lie, too.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.408
But here's the thing.

20:41.441 --> 20:44.277
Your brother's
in a lot of trouble.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.212
And I'm guessing he's hanging
around with some people

20:46.245 --> 20:47.847
that you don't
approve of.

20:49.316 --> 20:52.151
Yeah. Yeah.
For a job he's doing.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.453
Any idea
where we can find him?

20:53.486 --> 20:55.154
Or the crew
he's working with?

20:55.187 --> 20:56.956
We shared a ride
a few weeks ago,

20:56.989 --> 21:00.159
and he got dropped off first,
at a building downtown.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.329
Do you remember
the address?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.738
This is boring.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.106
Shouldn't we scope it out?
Peek in a window?

21:14.140 --> 21:15.942
Be sure we're not
wasting our time?

21:15.975 --> 21:17.977
That's not procedure.
We keep our eyes on a place

21:18.010 --> 21:20.146
until we can run
a detailed records search.

21:20.179 --> 21:23.483
That could take hours. Easily.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.752
Well, I wish you would have
told me that before.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.019
Before what?

21:27.053 --> 21:29.456
I could have brought snacks
or some-- Oh.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.591
Did you call for backup
from the LAPD?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.159
No. I texted.

21:33.192 --> 21:35.928
7-Adam-15, show me Code 6,
Olympic and 10th.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.163
Hey. What's going on?

21:37.196 --> 21:39.532
John, this is my training agent,
Carter Hope.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.200
That's not-- I'm not--
Nice to meet you.

21:41.233 --> 21:42.602
Yeah.
So who are we
staking out?

21:42.635 --> 21:44.003
Well, murder suspects,

21:44.036 --> 21:45.638
but she had no reason
to alert you.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.107
Whoa. Looks like
they're coming out.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.442
Seems like
they're taking off.

21:49.476 --> 21:50.643
We should go stop them, right?

21:50.677 --> 21:52.311
Negative.
We don't even know

21:52.345 --> 21:53.480
if they're actually
connected to the case.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.382
So we're just gonna
let them get away?

21:55.415 --> 21:56.949
Even though we suspect that
they might be planning

21:56.983 --> 21:58.284
an even bigger crime?

21:58.317 --> 22:00.019
I could try to
call in another unit,

22:00.052 --> 22:00.853
have them picked up
on a pretext.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.288
At least we get an ID.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.123
Great.
I'm gonna follow that guy,

22:04.156 --> 22:05.658
call you
with an intercept course.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.126
Simone, no--

22:09.028 --> 22:10.162
It's like she's allergic
to listening.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.998
You have no idea.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.833
Hang on.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.469
That changes things.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.971
7-Adam-15, we have
three suspects with guns

22:19.005 --> 22:20.139
on Olympic and 10th.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.073
Gonna have to
make contact now.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.542
Show me Code 3.
Send backup.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.010
You coming?
Yeah.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.057
Hello, handsome.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.726
This is an R1?

22:39.759 --> 22:41.027
You know your bikes.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.896
Ha!
I also know how to ride.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.331
Okay.
Okay.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.203
Cops.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.248
Shoot!

23:11.924 --> 23:13.092
Shots fired,
shots fired.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.594
Three suspects
on street bikes.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.529
One heading east on Olympic,
one heading south on 10th,

23:16.563 --> 23:17.730
one in the alley
behind Olympic.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.802
What's going on with your hand?
You okay?
Hell no.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.637
I chipped a nail,
but I did it

23:24.671 --> 23:26.606
scratching the guy
on the bike.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.240
I got his DNA.

23:28.274 --> 23:29.942
Pretty good, right?

23:40.453 --> 23:42.789
They killed him because
we were onto him, huh?

23:42.822 --> 23:44.557
Seems like it.
Any sign of the crew?

23:44.591 --> 23:46.058
No.
They all disappeared.

23:46.092 --> 23:49.629
Listen, uh...
what is he wearing?

23:52.131 --> 23:55.134
Out of all the probies, why did
you choose a half-assed actor?

23:55.167 --> 23:57.336
You need to watch an episode
of his show.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.639
You'll believe in
the vampire cop.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.307
Are you fanboying
right now?

24:01.340 --> 24:03.943
Hell yeah.
He's a chameleon.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.312
Just think of all the undercover
ops we can run with this kid.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.917
So they lit the computer
on fire, huh?

24:10.950 --> 24:12.485
Uh, no, sir.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.353
They poured acid on it
before they took off.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.421
Which means they didn't
want us to know

24:15.454 --> 24:16.756
what they were doing on it.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.691
You aced computers
in the Academy, right?

24:18.725 --> 24:20.459
Funny story--
as a teenager

24:20.493 --> 24:22.962
I played an emo hacker in
"My Hard Drive Ate My Homework."

24:22.995 --> 24:25.164
It was my first foray
into method acting--

24:25.197 --> 24:26.499
It's a yes or no question, Hollywood.

24:26.533 --> 24:28.968
It's not an invitation
to give a TED Talk.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.537
Right, sorry.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.939
Um, yes, I'm great
with computers.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.674
Good.
Huddle up with I.T.,

24:34.707 --> 24:36.142
see what you can salvage.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.610
Priority One.

24:37.644 --> 24:40.379
So, you scraped
the unsub's skin for DNA.

24:40.412 --> 24:41.714
That's clever.

24:41.748 --> 24:42.715
Reckless as hell.

24:42.749 --> 24:44.784
Reckless, yes,
but "as hell"?

24:44.817 --> 24:47.520
I'd say that's about a six on
the Simone recklessness scale.

24:47.554 --> 24:49.656
The lab will have some results
by morning.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.290
Hopefully
he's in the system.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.626
Does that mean I'm working
for you again tomorrow?

24:53.660 --> 24:55.061
Depends on the results.

24:55.094 --> 24:57.396
Th-That's a yes, right?

25:00.266 --> 25:02.301
He's just playing
hard to get, girl.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.336
We bonded big-time today.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.709
I feel like I'm back
at the Academy, you know?

25:09.742 --> 25:11.243
No one thought
I belonged.

25:11.277 --> 25:14.180
Or me.
But finish that story.

25:14.213 --> 25:17.083
We proved them wrong,
and we can do it again.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.886
Give me some.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.020
Yeah, you're right.

25:21.053 --> 25:24.023
I mean, sure, I-I made a mistake
or two today.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.825
Nine, actually.
I kept count.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.193
But it's not like
my training agent

25:27.226 --> 25:28.194
doesn't have
her own issues, you know?

25:28.227 --> 25:29.528
She's-- She's a mess.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.764
Who, Ms. Perfect?
Yeah.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.499
Garza's niece gave me
the lowdown.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.703
Give it to me.
Spill that tea.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.905
Laura was the youngest agent
ever to be accepted

25:38.938 --> 25:40.372
in the Behavioral Science Unit.

25:40.406 --> 25:43.275
But she had a meltdown
when she found out

25:43.309 --> 25:47.246
that her fiancé
was sleeping with her BFF.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.381
I know you lyin'.
Mm-hmm.

25:49.415 --> 25:51.217
She out here catching
serial killers

25:51.250 --> 25:52.785
but couldn't catch
a serial cheater?

25:52.819 --> 25:56.723
Under her nose?

25:56.756 --> 25:58.625
That is not--
That is a terrible laugh.

25:58.658 --> 26:01.060
Why am I--
Stop laughing.

26:01.093 --> 26:04.363
I gave Sam
the ring back.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.232
An engagement ring
is an implied gift,

26:06.265 --> 26:08.601
so legally that diamond
is your property.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.369
I know.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.205
I, uh, did it for my own
emotional health.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.406
I need closure.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.642
You need a vacation.

26:15.675 --> 26:17.309
And selling that ring
could've bought you one.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.711
Yeah.

26:18.745 --> 26:21.714
You and I both know I can't take
any more time off.

26:21.748 --> 26:24.416
My career is
hanging by a thread.

26:24.450 --> 26:27.319
Well, good thing you don't have
a problematic trainee.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.321
What about Carter?
You hear anything about him?

26:29.355 --> 26:31.624
The bosses all seem
to respect him,

26:31.658 --> 26:33.225
until it's time
for a promotion.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.061
He's been passed over
for years.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.296
So he's a crab
in the barrel.

26:37.329 --> 26:40.266
His company-man routine
is not paying off,

26:40.299 --> 26:41.934
but he's steady trying
to dim my shine.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.502
He's the worst.

I can, too.

27:17.236 --> 27:20.206

you've been dying for?

Better office hours,

29:37.376 --> 29:39.611
Oh!
Good morning, boss.

29:39.645 --> 29:41.580
You <i>are</i> my boss, right?

29:41.613 --> 29:44.316
Please tell me we got a hit
on the DNA.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.585
We did.
You're on the team.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.020
Please don't make me
regret this.

29:48.054 --> 29:49.255
Everyone,
get in here now.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.527
His name's Todd Lenox.

29:55.561 --> 29:58.030
ViCAP ties him to several
violent heists across the U.S.

29:58.064 --> 30:00.099
And facial recognition
captured him arriving

30:00.132 --> 30:02.134
at El Paso Airport
last night.

30:02.168 --> 30:04.270
El Paso was one of the cities
accessed on our vic's laptop.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.372
Exactly.
We're wheels up in 15.

30:06.405 --> 30:09.175
Wait, what?
As in, in the air?

30:09.208 --> 30:11.210
Oh, you don't know?

30:11.243 --> 30:13.012
My unit has a jet.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.046
Damn!

30:15.481 --> 30:17.449
Now, thieves like Lenox
are often driven by

30:17.483 --> 30:19.886
a pathological need
to perfect their craft.

30:19.919 --> 30:22.388
With each successful score,
their ambition grows.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.790
So expect whatever
he's targeting next

30:24.823 --> 30:27.493
will be bigger and riskier
than anything he's ever done.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.962
Simone, you disagree?

30:29.996 --> 30:33.399
No, it's just that with some
of my most troubled kids,

30:33.432 --> 30:35.467
it was less about
what they <i>were</i> doing

30:35.501 --> 30:37.669
and more about
what they <i>weren't</i> doing.

30:37.703 --> 30:40.506
They weren't coming to class,
doing their homework,

30:40.539 --> 30:42.374
engaging with friends.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.376
Okay, well, then what
<i>isn't</i> Lenox doing?

30:44.410 --> 30:45.811
Breaking and entering.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.380
I mean, there's never been
a sign of forced entry.

30:48.414 --> 30:50.983
It's not unreasonable to believe
that he tapped a locksmith

30:51.017 --> 30:53.152
or a hacker
as the job demanded.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.021
I mean, even with the best
locksmith or hacker,

30:55.054 --> 30:57.089
there'd be evidence
the system was tampered with.

30:57.123 --> 30:59.225
So either
this guy is Houdini--

30:59.258 --> 31:01.160
Or he had someone
on the inside.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.195
Well, to plant an insider
at a federal building,

31:03.229 --> 31:04.496
they'd have to have
a clean record,

31:04.530 --> 31:06.332
get past extensive
background checks.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.601
It'd be impossible to penetrate
that kind of wall.
Oh, my God, the...

31:09.635 --> 31:10.769
the janitor.

31:10.802 --> 31:13.339
When I was doing
background checks yesterday,

31:13.372 --> 31:16.775
I got a rush job--
uh, this guy Micah... Olsen.

31:16.808 --> 31:18.610
Micah Olsen.

31:18.644 --> 31:21.613
He was a chemical engineer,
suddenly quits his job,

31:21.647 --> 31:25.184
moves to El Paso to be a janitor
at the Federal Reserve.

31:25.217 --> 31:28.120
I thought it was suspicious
as hell, but I got overruled.

31:28.154 --> 31:30.689
Yeah, the Federal Reserve
would match Lenox's M.O.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.291
That security
is impenetrable.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.560
Unless Micah is
the inside man.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.762
He started work there
this morning.

31:36.795 --> 31:39.131
Carter, call
the Federal Reserve Police.

31:39.165 --> 31:40.432
Put them on
high alert.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.568
Laura, loop in
the El Paso field office.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.603
We land in 20.

32:37.523 --> 32:39.458
This way.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.830
Is there anyone left?

32:44.863 --> 32:46.765
Oh!

32:58.810 --> 33:00.812
The Federal Reserve's vault
is on the basement level.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.781
Yeah, but the fire alarm was
pulled on the fourth floor.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.051
Most likely to draw us
away from the vault.

33:05.084 --> 33:07.186
The money
in the vault's traceable.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.521
Even if they could walk out
with all that cash,

33:09.555 --> 33:11.323
they wouldn't be able
to spend a dollar of it.

33:11.357 --> 33:12.724
What's your point, Simone?

33:12.758 --> 33:15.394
I'd go after the money
that <i>can't</i> be traced.

33:15.427 --> 33:16.728
The cash-processing room.

33:16.762 --> 33:17.963
Millions of old bills

33:17.996 --> 33:19.631
that are gonna be destroyed
are separated out,

33:19.665 --> 33:22.034
serial numbers erased
from the federal system.

33:22.068 --> 33:23.569
The money's untraceable
after that.

33:23.602 --> 33:24.903
It's got to be easier
to get into that room

33:24.936 --> 33:26.905
than it is to the vault,
right?
But with Micah's training,

33:26.938 --> 33:28.540
they could easily blow a hole
in the vault,

33:28.574 --> 33:30.676
where there's twice as much
money housed.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.546

But what?

41:29.721 --> 41:31.523
You think I need
to dial it down now?

41:31.557 --> 41:33.491
If you think
you're gonna get me to quit

41:33.525 --> 41:36.394
by telling me that I'm being
too "me," you're mistaken.

41:36.427 --> 41:37.462
I'm not trying
to get you to quit.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.030
I'm trying to help you.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.332
I need you to understand that
it's okay not to know something.

41:41.366 --> 41:42.400
You've never done this job before,

41:42.433 --> 41:44.302
and you're here
to learn how.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.872
Because Garza
clearly hates me,

41:46.905 --> 41:48.974
I'm here to teach you.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.642
Understood.

41:50.676 --> 41:52.978
I'm good with that,
as long as you're good with

41:53.011 --> 41:55.213
learning something from me,
too, along the way,

41:55.246 --> 41:57.683
like how to lighten up
and live a little,

41:57.716 --> 42:00.185
flies at the picnic.

42:00.218 --> 42:01.987
My God, this is gonna be
the longest

42:02.020 --> 42:03.955
18-month probationary period ever.

42:05.290 --> 42:07.058
We've got a case.
Elena!

42:07.092 --> 42:08.694
Again with the yelling, <i>tío.</i>

42:08.727 --> 42:10.328
Upload the case file
into the fishbowl.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.730
Ha ha ha.
I mean briefing room.

42:11.763 --> 42:13.965
Let's go, everybody.
We got a crime to solve.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.069
Hey.
You coming or what?

42:27.378 --> 42:30.348
