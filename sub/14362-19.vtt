<i>Out here in the Middle,</i>

00:05.642 --> 00:08.482
<i>we're not caviar, champagne,</i>
<i>or theater people.</i>

00:08.559 --> 00:10.855
<i>We like pretzels, beer, and TV.</i>

00:11.374 --> 00:12.876
36 salt specks.

00:13.385 --> 00:14.868
You count
the number of salt specks?

00:14.967 --> 00:15.667
You don't count?

00:15.755 --> 00:17.398
No. No, I don't.

00:17.478 --> 00:19.402
That's another one
in the "Just You" column.

00:19.491 --> 00:21.354
Mm. There are fewer specks
than there used to be.

00:21.451 --> 00:22.981
They're clearly cutting back
on salt.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.462
Isn't that the point of the pretzel --

00:24.581 --> 00:26.813
to have it be
both salty <i> and</i> crunchy?

00:26.928 --> 00:27.849
Otherwise, it's toast.

00:27.949 --> 00:30.152
Remember the rule --
no talking when the TV's on?

00:30.266 --> 00:31.396
But the TV's <i> always</i> on.

00:31.474 --> 00:32.630
And why do you think that is?

00:33.601 --> 00:36.962
Hey, guys, don't spoil
your appetite with junk.

00:37.046 --> 00:38.546
As soon as
I find the hair dryer,

00:38.652 --> 00:39.677
I'm microwaving taquitos.

00:40.945 --> 00:42.206
Ooh, listen.

00:42.337 --> 00:43.958
Oh, that's pretty.

00:44.041 --> 00:45.718
Somebody got wind chimes.

00:46.383 --> 00:49.181
Hmm. There's an 800 number
on the back.

00:49.282 --> 00:51.386
It says they're excited to hear
my questions and comments.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.181
We'll see about that.

00:53.282 --> 00:55.725
I'm not a yes man.
I'm gonna tell it like it is.

00:55.831 --> 00:57.409
You know, maybe <i> we</i> could
get some wind chimes.

00:57.486 --> 00:59.441
It'd be fun to do
something nice like that.

00:59.534 --> 01:00.816
Jazz up the house, you know?

01:00.916 --> 01:02.130
TV's on.

01:04.123 --> 01:05.211
Thanks for hanging out
at the mall

01:05.294 --> 01:06.892
and then driving me home.

01:06.975 --> 01:08.734
I could watch you
make potatoes all day.

01:08.833 --> 01:11.096
I could watch you
watch me make potatoes all day.

01:12.203 --> 01:13.917
Sorry
they called security on you.

01:13.992 --> 01:15.588
You <i> were</i> there a long time.

01:15.691 --> 01:16.468
I wish I could ask you in,

01:16.572 --> 01:18.481
but that's the price you pay

01:18.566 --> 01:20.902
when you're keeping
your relationship a secret.

01:20.982 --> 01:22.025
No, you're right.

01:22.118 --> 01:23.112
Once everyone finds out,

01:23.190 --> 01:24.914
it always seems
to get messed up.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.018
It's like people are threatened
by our joy.

01:27.109 --> 01:28.164
That's why it's critical

01:28.272 --> 01:30.517
that absolutely no one
finds out about us.

01:31.535 --> 01:32.527
I'm in love with Darrin,

01:32.622 --> 01:35.051
and I need to shout it
from the rooftop!

01:35.857 --> 01:36.921
Wait -- what?

01:37.012 --> 01:38.293
We didn't want anyone
pulling us apart,

01:38.387 --> 01:39.798
so we've been
keeping it a secret.

01:39.906 --> 01:41.898
It's been so hard!

01:41.995 --> 01:43.137
How long
has this been going on?

01:43.249 --> 01:44.459
Since prom last night.

01:44.583 --> 01:46.980
I just think about Darrin
all the time.

01:47.129 --> 01:50.571
And when he's not around,
I just miss him so much.

01:50.691 --> 01:51.970
How do you bear
the burning ache

01:52.063 --> 01:54.254
when you're apart from dad
all day?!

01:54.457 --> 01:56.495
I'm not gonna say it's easy.

01:56.607 --> 01:58.309
It really feels right this time.

01:58.441 --> 02:03.127
In fact, when he kissed me, I heard bells.

02:03.278 --> 02:05.596
If that's the case, then
we're <i> all</i> in love with Darrin.

02:08.280 --> 02:11.829
Dude, I found the perfect couch
for our apartment next year.

02:11.927 --> 02:13.343
Cool. Where?

02:13.438 --> 02:15.149
Behind this dumpster
on State Street.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.986
Wh-- And it's just
sitting there? For free?

02:18.071 --> 02:18.658
Yeah.

02:18.776 --> 02:21.499
I smelled it, and on a scale
of 1 to Kenny, about a 7.

02:21.598 --> 02:22.965
Ooh.

02:23.061 --> 02:25.423
Uh, speaking of Kenny,
I haven't exactly told him

02:25.528 --> 02:27.921
you and I are rooming together
next year.

02:28.031 --> 02:29.519
Ooh. Right.

02:29.652 --> 02:31.231
Be gentle.

02:32.515 --> 02:34.204
Living with Hutch next year.

02:34.324 --> 02:35.839
Yeah. He's taking it
pretty hard.

02:35.925 --> 02:37.597
We should give him some space.

02:39.752 --> 02:41.028
All right, come on.
It's right over here.

02:41.110 --> 02:42.133
Right over here.

02:42.797 --> 02:43.810
Huh?
What'd I say?

02:43.890 --> 02:45.405
Oh!
This is totally awesome!

02:45.519 --> 02:46.818
I call right side.

02:49.662 --> 02:50.676
Ah!

02:53.316 --> 02:54.406
Yeah.

02:54.531 --> 02:56.256
Hey, and when the game's on,
we can put down plastic

02:56.340 --> 02:57.752
and fill this
full of hot wings.

02:57.837 --> 02:58.388
Ooh!

02:58.477 --> 02:59.676
And when you want
to dump the bones,

02:59.785 --> 03:01.816
just lift it out
like a garbage liner.

03:01.909 --> 03:04.213
It's a bowl <i>and</i> a trash can.

03:04.298 --> 03:05.555
The bowl-can.

03:05.678 --> 03:06.974
The trash-owl.

03:07.081 --> 03:07.649
Eh...

03:07.743 --> 03:09.065
We'll come up
with a name later.

03:09.998 --> 03:11.648
Hoo!

03:13.889 --> 03:15.038
Ohh!

03:15.119 --> 03:16.851
Those chimes just don't stop!

03:17.041 --> 03:18.284
You know, it was cute at first,

03:18.384 --> 03:20.414
but after a while,
it just gets annoying.

03:20.511 --> 03:21.671
Kind of like kids.

03:21.772 --> 03:23.188
It <i> is</i> a bit oppressive.

03:23.455 --> 03:24.515
Hey, what are you doing?

03:24.658 --> 03:27.052
You're not answering
another Craigslist ad, are you?

03:27.133 --> 03:29.429
I told you -- we're not getting
a four-person pedal boat.

03:29.514 --> 03:32.131
I'm off that. Too impractical.
We're a family of five.

03:32.276 --> 03:34.568
Anyway, I'm calling
the pretzel information line

03:34.649 --> 03:36.796
to inform them
the decrease in salt crystals

03:36.905 --> 03:38.559
has not gone unnoticed.

03:38.657 --> 03:40.757
So, this is just
regular odd behavior?

03:40.856 --> 03:42.153
This isn't
gonna cost me anything?

03:42.264 --> 03:45.057
Toll-free call, just like
the Bureau of Land Management.

03:45.239 --> 03:47.782
Bureau of Land Management.

03:50.509 --> 03:51.436
<i>Hi, and welcome to</i>

03:51.536 --> 03:53.006

<i>family of products.</i>

04:06.587 --> 04:07.745
<i>We're sorry,</i>

04:07.830 --> 04:10.012

04:15.263 --> 04:16.452
Hello.

04:16.942 --> 04:19.315
Oh, my God!

04:19.522 --> 04:21.440
Campus is still
like a million miles away.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.729
What were we thinking?!

04:22.835 --> 04:24.403
Man, we need a truck.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.182
And two other dudes
to put it in the truck.

04:26.261 --> 04:27.688
I can't go
looking for a truck <i> now.</i>

04:27.773 --> 04:29.152
I got to get to class.

04:29.235 --> 04:30.424
We can't leave this thing
sitting here.

04:30.628 --> 04:32.747
If someone takes it,
we're gonna spend all next year

04:32.854 --> 04:35.158
knowing that someone is sitting
in our dumpster couch.

04:35.282 --> 04:36.554
I know.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.882
What if I go to class,
you spend the night here,

04:39.014 --> 04:40.603
and I'll get a truck tomorrow?

04:40.754 --> 04:41.277
What --

04:41.372 --> 04:42.408
Look, you stay,

04:42.541 --> 04:43.859
I'll let you pick
your favorite side

04:43.960 --> 04:45.883
for when we have
our own place, huh?

04:46.087 --> 04:47.110
Hmm.

04:47.997 --> 04:50.028
All right.
Let's see.

04:58.208 --> 05:01.148
Mike, wake up.
Do you hear that?

05:01.270 --> 05:03.768
I didn't before you took
the pillow off my head.

05:04.615 --> 05:06.850
People need their sleep.

05:07.004 --> 05:09.592
It's the only time
we get a break from our lives.

Advertise your product or brand here

05:21.613 --> 05:23.601
Hey, shut up
your stupid wind chimes!

05:23.711 --> 05:25.654
People are trying to sleep!

05:28.991 --> 05:30.731
Well, at least
I didn't hear the wind chimes

05:30.888 --> 05:33.233
for a second there while you were yelling.

05:33.962 --> 05:36.109
I'm sorry,
but it's noise pollution, Mike.

05:36.314 --> 05:39.185
Plain and simple --
noise pollution.

05:39.456 --> 05:40.833
You know, the media
is partly to blame

05:40.979 --> 05:42.594
'cause they never report on it.

05:42.812 --> 05:44.384
It's not sexy,
like air pollution

05:44.517 --> 05:46.190
or water pollution.

05:55.202 --> 05:57.495
You got a problem
with my wind chimes?

05:57.633 --> 05:59.919
Oh, h-hey, Rita.

06:00.081 --> 06:01.343
Oh, did you hear that, too?

06:01.450 --> 06:02.994
Yeah, I think
it came from the Norwoods.

06:03.086 --> 06:04.591
Paula's kind of a hothead.

06:04.701 --> 06:05.817
I know it was you.

06:05.914 --> 06:08.099
I recognized
your monkey chatter.

06:08.210 --> 06:09.166
Oh. Gee.

06:09.261 --> 06:10.334
Did I do that?

06:10.464 --> 06:12.461
Well, you see,
I-I'm a sleep yeller.

06:12.610 --> 06:14.544
I yell in my sleep.
It's really rare.

06:14.651 --> 06:15.732
I'm gonna be in a book
about it.

06:16.666 --> 06:18.646
What's your deal
against my chimes?

06:18.736 --> 06:20.072
My chimes are pretty.

06:20.238 --> 06:22.652
I'm trying
to beautify the neighborhood.

06:23.319 --> 06:25.438
Yeah. Oh, beauty is good.

06:25.565 --> 06:26.841
Could always use more beauty.

06:26.927 --> 06:29.950
Never met anyone who said
"Go easy on the beauty," right?

06:30.124 --> 06:32.593
I am trying to cultivate
a sense of inner peace

06:32.700 --> 06:36.298
'cause I just came back
from a 6-to-9-month mandatory...

06:36.706 --> 06:37.890
spa.

06:38.001 --> 06:39.634
Oooh! Spa!

06:39.744 --> 06:42.204
Well, that explains
why you look so relaxed.

06:42.290 --> 06:44.033
I got a lot of rage in me.

06:44.183 --> 06:46.541
Probably 'cause I'm going
through the pre-menopause.

06:46.682 --> 06:49.558
I'm not sleeping,
I'm hot all the time.

06:49.658 --> 06:51.831
I mean,
I still like sex plenty.

06:52.074 --> 06:54.802
That's not an issue,
like it is with <i> you.</i>

06:54.889 --> 06:58.063
No wonder you only got
three kids if you sleep in <i> that.</i>

06:58.341 --> 06:59.468
Well...

06:59.563 --> 07:01.114
they all look the same
tossed at the foot of the bed.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.193
Am I right?

07:04.353 --> 07:06.042
Anyhoo...

07:06.154 --> 07:09.879
rest assured you will not
be hearing a peep out of me --

07:09.974 --> 07:11.295
at least when I'm awake.

07:11.390 --> 07:14.028
The conscious me
loves the wind chimes.

07:14.773 --> 07:17.255
Well, if you want
to <i> stay</i> conscious...

07:17.425 --> 07:18.431
you better.

07:19.798 --> 07:21.149
Well, I guess
you have to get going,

07:21.234 --> 07:23.180
'cause your ankle bracelet
is flashing.

07:40.010 --> 07:41.222
Where have you been?!

07:41.342 --> 07:42.413
Just woke up.

07:42.510 --> 07:43.407
It's noon.

07:43.560 --> 07:44.412
Now, where's the truck?

07:44.556 --> 07:45.680
Uh, well,
here's the thing --

07:45.777 --> 07:47.911
I can't get Olsen's truck
till Saturday.

07:47.994 --> 07:49.149
- What?!
- But it's no big deal.

07:49.251 --> 07:51.422
Nichols Forest is 100 yards up.

07:51.509 --> 07:53.972
We'll drag the couch
deep into the woods

07:54.057 --> 07:56.310
and leave it
where no one will ever find it.

07:56.810 --> 07:57.807
You know,
I'm a little uncomfortable

07:57.895 --> 08:00.179
with how quickly
you came up with that idea.

08:00.997 --> 08:01.710
All right.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.316
Hey, Mike.
Listen to this.

08:06.432 --> 08:07.180
No.

08:07.257 --> 08:08.224
You haven't even heard it yet.

08:08.272 --> 08:10.062
I'm writing a letter
to Rita Glossner.

08:10.212 --> 08:11.932
Exactly. No.

08:12.026 --> 08:13.414
No, it's not a regular letter.

08:13.503 --> 08:15.306
It's on nice stationery,

08:15.395 --> 08:17.429
and I'm dropping it off
with a box of candy.

08:17.629 --> 08:20.455
I mean, think about it.
Nobody treats Rita like this.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.327
Nobody breaks out
the good stationery

08:22.426 --> 08:23.738
and gives her chocolates.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.454
They just have her arrested.

08:25.631 --> 08:26.907
Not gonna work, Frankie.

08:26.994 --> 08:29.576
Well, I got to <i> something.</i>
Just listen.

08:29.844 --> 08:32.206
"Dear, Rita, thanks so much
for having us over

08:32.333 --> 08:35.890
to your super-fun front-yard
pool party last summer.

08:36.039 --> 08:38.445
I feel bad
we haven't reciprocated.

08:38.530 --> 08:41.585
When the weather is less windy,
we'd like to have you over.

08:41.684 --> 08:43.077
Oh,
and speaking of wind --"

08:43.159 --> 08:44.224
See what I did there? --

08:44.332 --> 08:46.250
"Would you mind
taking down your wind chimes?

08:46.358 --> 08:47.999
That'd be great.
Thanks, neighbor.

08:48.114 --> 08:49.725
Also, my husband
has diverticulitis,

08:49.841 --> 08:51.404
and the noise
isn't good for that."

08:51.580 --> 08:54.081
Don't drag <i> me</i> into this.
I don't have that.

08:54.210 --> 08:56.429
Well, you might.
<i>Something's</i> making you crabby.

08:56.512 --> 08:58.265
Anyway, it's worth a shot.

08:58.631 --> 08:59.748
Were there any calls for me?

08:59.845 --> 09:01.525
I left my name and number
with the pretzel people,

09:01.627 --> 09:02.776
and they're gonna call back.

09:02.892 --> 09:04.055
Have an idea for them.

09:04.156 --> 09:05.406
Really?
What do you got?

09:05.601 --> 09:08.462
Well, you know how people take
pretzels and dip them in cheese?

09:08.599 --> 09:11.715
What if you take the cheese
and put it <i> inside</i> the pretzel?

09:11.803 --> 09:12.703
Boom!

09:12.779 --> 09:14.377
They already have those, Brick.

09:14.540 --> 09:15.384
What?

09:15.469 --> 09:17.896
Yeah. We don't buy them
'cause they're a dime more.

09:17.973 --> 09:19.505
What am I gonna do
when they call back?!

09:19.625 --> 09:20.929
I've got nothing!

09:21.018 --> 09:22.437
I need a new idea.

09:22.627 --> 09:23.842
I'll be in my room.

09:24.830 --> 09:25.846
Peanut butter?

09:25.921 --> 09:26.648
Done.

09:26.761 --> 09:27.876
Ohhhhh!

09:29.162 --> 09:31.234
This is nice.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.171
Yeah.

09:32.251 --> 09:33.481
Good couch-to-foot
ratio.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.148
I am in complete agreement.

09:35.257 --> 09:36.743
This is a good sign
for next year.

09:36.822 --> 09:38.051
We are gonna be good roommates.

09:38.159 --> 09:38.987
Oh, yeah.

09:39.563 --> 09:41.257
Hey, you want to watch
"Revenge"?

09:41.356 --> 09:42.662
Hells yeah!

09:47.748 --> 09:49.920
Okay,
the chimes haven't stopped,

09:50.051 --> 09:51.708
but that doesn't mean anything.

09:51.804 --> 09:54.228
I mean, Rita might not have even
seen the letter yet.

09:54.370 --> 09:57.120
But she <i> had</i> to.
I put it on her doorstep.

09:57.284 --> 09:59.758
But then, why hasn't she
taken the chimes down?

10:00.873 --> 10:02.358
What if she can't read?

10:02.522 --> 10:05.000
No. She steals our paper.
She can read.

10:05.097 --> 10:07.841
Oh, mom. I'm not
gonna be around Saturday.

10:08.003 --> 10:09.123
I'll be with Darrin.

10:09.260 --> 10:10.669
You know
we're going out again, right?

10:10.768 --> 10:12.358
- Yeah.
- So, if you need me,

10:12.468 --> 10:15.249
we're gonna be at a
birthday party for a 1-year-old.

10:15.695 --> 10:17.089
Darrin has a friend
with a baby?

10:17.187 --> 10:19.300
Mm-hmm. They met
at air-conditioning school.

10:19.397 --> 10:21.842
The friend, not the baby.

10:23.512 --> 10:25.029
Okay, it wasn't easy,

10:25.142 --> 10:26.872
but I believe
I have some real winners here.

10:27.265 --> 10:28.806
Cinnamon-roll pretzels.

10:28.889 --> 10:29.452
Done.

10:29.539 --> 10:30.538
Fire-roasted chipotle.

10:30.649 --> 10:31.295
Done.

10:31.432 --> 10:33.157
Garlic, sun-dried tomato,
parmesan.

10:33.256 --> 10:34.160
Done.

10:34.251 --> 10:36.433
Why are they
coming to me for ideas?

10:36.532 --> 10:38.034
They've already thought
of everything!

10:38.162 --> 10:40.214
The chimes, the chimes.

10:40.293 --> 10:41.594
I can't think!

10:54.458 --> 10:55.334
Wh--?

10:56.457 --> 10:58.309
So, you gonna be
my friend now, hmm?

10:58.422 --> 10:59.764
You think that you can buy me

10:59.902 --> 11:03.324
with your free chocolates
that the insurance company sent?

11:03.409 --> 11:05.174
No.<i> I</i> ate
the insurance chocolates.

11:05.238 --> 11:07.194
I bought those special for you.

11:07.293 --> 11:08.660
You don't want to be my friend.

11:08.773 --> 11:10.521
You trying to manipilate me.

11:10.650 --> 11:12.056
I will not be manipilated.

11:12.128 --> 11:14.858
Trust me, Rita -- I'm not
trying to... manipilate you.

11:14.975 --> 11:15.899
I don't believe you.

11:15.987 --> 11:18.218
I thought we'd put the past
behind us, but I guess not.

11:18.315 --> 11:19.584
You hurt my feelings.

11:19.688 --> 11:20.586
You know what you are?

11:20.668 --> 11:22.125
You're a mean girl.
Mm-hmm.

11:22.203 --> 11:23.497
You're a mean girl and a bully,

11:23.590 --> 11:25.358
and the whole neighborhood
knows it.

11:25.443 --> 11:27.585
What?!
I am not a bully!

11:27.697 --> 11:30.597
I'm nice. I sent you chocolates.
I used the good stationery.

11:30.684 --> 11:32.034
I never even use stationery!

11:32.127 --> 11:33.350
You know what, Rita?
<i>You're</i> the bully.

11:33.432 --> 11:34.615
And I'm not scared of you.

11:53.431 --> 11:54.542
So,
you never told me --

11:54.632 --> 11:56.223
how'd your note go over
with Rita?

12:05.766 --> 12:08.028
<i>Not wanting to poke</i>
<i>the Hillbilly Bear any further,</i>

12:08.153 --> 12:11.157
<i>Mike brought home a solution</i>
<i>from the quarry.</i>

12:11.327 --> 12:12.407
Okay.

12:12.494 --> 12:15.046
So, Rita Glossner
has us in her cross hairs,

12:15.168 --> 12:17.634
but maybe we get
some other sucker

12:17.734 --> 12:19.628
to file a complaint
or something, you know?

12:19.709 --> 12:21.811
Take the heat off of us --
like the Donahues.

12:21.963 --> 12:23.375
Were you talking to me?

12:23.583 --> 12:24.344
What?

12:24.436 --> 12:25.217
What?

12:25.301 --> 12:26.597
I wasn't talking.

12:26.731 --> 12:27.441
Was I?

12:27.544 --> 12:28.764
Listen,
take off your headphones

12:28.847 --> 12:30.280
when you see
people's lips moving,

12:30.383 --> 12:32.012
it's just simple
dinner headphone etiquette.

12:32.101 --> 12:33.635
Hey!

12:33.744 --> 12:35.950
Listen. It's quiet.

12:36.035 --> 12:37.502
Ooh, take them off.
Take them off.

12:39.618 --> 12:40.968
- Oh, that's so nice.
- Yes!

12:41.051 --> 12:42.622
Mm.

12:45.035 --> 12:46.048
Oh.

12:46.193 --> 12:47.009
Don't answer that.

12:47.105 --> 12:48.888
It could be the pretzel people,
and I'm not ready yet!

12:48.974 --> 12:51.139
No, it's Darrin.
I'm texting him right now,

12:51.238 --> 12:53.708
and sometimes he likes to call
when we're texting.

12:53.791 --> 12:55.444
It's so cute.

12:55.721 --> 12:56.676
Hello?

12:56.776 --> 12:57.924
Oh.

12:58.083 --> 12:58.889
Hello?

12:58.973 --> 13:00.151
Okay, so, before,

13:00.259 --> 13:02.358
I was concentrating
on pretzel <i> flavors --</i>

13:04.926 --> 13:07.028
...but maybe I was thinking
too conventionally.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.211
What if there was a pretzel
that the more you chew it,

13:09.305 --> 13:10.479
it turns into gum?

13:11.694 --> 13:13.020
See you later!

13:13.101 --> 13:14.188
I'm going with Darrin
to the mall

13:14.285 --> 13:16.042
to help him buy new socks.

13:18.468 --> 13:19.743
- Did you hear that?
- Hmm?

13:19.828 --> 13:21.168
They're off to buy socks.

13:21.307 --> 13:22.728
They do <i> everything</i> together.

13:22.826 --> 13:26.601
And Saturday, they're going to
some repairman toddler party.

13:26.718 --> 13:27.423
What?

13:27.500 --> 13:29.106
Yeah. That's who
Darrin's friends are now --

13:29.203 --> 13:30.471
people with kids.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.174
So, they're going
to a party with kids.

13:32.257 --> 13:33.212
Big deal.

13:33.287 --> 13:35.482
Not my idea of fun, but maybe
she'll bring home cake.

13:35.585 --> 13:37.669
The big deal is,
Sue is still in high school,

13:37.792 --> 13:39.250
and she should be doing
high-school things.

13:39.378 --> 13:41.378
I just don't want her
growing up too fast.

13:41.473 --> 13:43.164
Wait a minute. I thought
you were okay with Darrin.

13:43.292 --> 13:44.433
Oh, I was, but what happens

13:44.527 --> 13:46.369
when he graduates
two months from now?

13:46.459 --> 13:49.086
He's gonna get a job
and his own place.

13:49.207 --> 13:51.838
Are we gonna let Sue
date someone with an apartment?

13:51.923 --> 13:53.998
No. We're definitely
not doing that.

13:54.087 --> 13:56.064
Well, I'm telling you, Mike,
that's how it starts.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.362
It goes socks, toddler party,
apartment,

13:59.535 --> 14:02.149
and then <i>another</i> toddler party.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.158
Hey, dad.

14:09.255 --> 14:10.527
When we were at the mall
buying Darrin socks,

14:10.626 --> 14:13.180
we got the cutest little puzzle
for Noah's birthday party.

14:13.276 --> 14:15.258
It is a puppy policeman.

14:15.346 --> 14:16.091
Take it back.

14:16.180 --> 14:18.076
You're not going
to any repairman toddler party.

14:18.209 --> 14:19.696
What? Why?

14:19.776 --> 14:21.249
I don't want you hanging out
with that kind of crowd.

14:21.398 --> 14:22.762
Toddlers?

14:22.839 --> 14:24.553
Look, I'm your dad,
and you'll do what I say.

14:24.726 --> 14:27.364
But there's gonna be a clown --
and cupcakes.

14:27.464 --> 14:29.253
<i>And</i> Darrin's gonna be there.

14:29.334 --> 14:30.998
Well, I'm not Darrin's dad.
I'm <i> your</i> dad.

14:31.130 --> 14:32.142
And you're not going.

14:32.236 --> 14:33.892
Now, put on your headphones
and go to bed.

14:34.002 --> 14:34.745
Wh--?

14:42.249 --> 14:43.415
Whoa, whoa!
Geez!

14:43.536 --> 14:44.484
Not a good time, man.

14:44.589 --> 14:47.632
There's been a...
development.

14:47.934 --> 14:48.946
Get what I'm saying?

14:49.198 --> 14:49.996
Yeah.

14:50.210 --> 14:51.148
No.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.002
I crashed a Beta Psi mixer,

14:53.099 --> 14:55.318
hit it off with a lady,
brought her back to our place.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.635
Dude! But we were
supposed to watch "Revenge"!

14:57.757 --> 14:59.315
Come on, man.
We could do that later.

14:59.412 --> 15:01.689
Is this what it's gonna
be like next year?

15:01.800 --> 15:02.844
What?! No!

15:02.928 --> 15:04.591
Why are you making
such a big deal out of this?

15:04.668 --> 15:05.619
Can't you just be cool?

15:05.692 --> 15:08.181
Whoa! Are you saying
I'm not cool?

15:08.342 --> 15:10.454
I am cool, man.
I'm very cool.

15:10.541 --> 15:11.879
Look, I'd do the same
for you --

15:11.951 --> 15:13.666
you know,
if you ever got a girl.

15:14.015 --> 15:16.904
That's harsh, man.
Harsh!

15:16.998 --> 15:17.606
You know what?

15:17.714 --> 15:19.100
I'm not so sure
I want to live with someone

15:19.178 --> 15:20.756
who would say
something like that to me.

15:20.872 --> 15:23.201
Fine! I'm not sure if I want
to live with you, either.

15:23.296 --> 15:25.646
Good. I'll just stay with Kenny.
We have a lot of laughs.

15:25.756 --> 15:26.612
Fine!

15:26.712 --> 15:28.366
Fine!
Enjoy woods girl.

15:28.457 --> 15:31.456
I hope you get a deer tick
in a very personal place.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.246
<i>Well, it turns out</i>
<i>Axl wasn't the only one</i>

15:40.347 --> 15:41.903
<i>with roommate problems.</i>

15:42.155 --> 15:43.740
Well, that should be
comfortable.

15:43.835 --> 15:45.290
Yeah --
an air mattress

15:45.407 --> 15:47.802
and the old comforter
the dog used to sleep on.

15:47.897 --> 15:48.682
Great!

15:48.796 --> 15:50.063
Well, we got to do
<i>something,</i> Mike.

15:50.155 --> 15:52.288
We haven't slept in two days.
We're miserable.

15:52.382 --> 15:53.541
If I don't get some sleep,
I'm gonna be worse

15:53.623 --> 15:55.308
at a job I'm already
not very good at.

15:55.386 --> 15:56.679
And then we put the kids
in a playpen,

15:56.781 --> 15:58.480
and all the grown-ups
jumped in the bouncy house.

15:58.587 --> 15:59.982
Oh, and there were juice boxes.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.209
I'm making it sound fun,
but it wasn't,

16:02.326 --> 16:03.889
'cause my Sue Bear
wasn't there.

16:04.002 --> 16:05.797
Ohhh.
I miss you, too!

16:05.942 --> 16:07.789
I can't believe
I didn't get to play

16:07.888 --> 16:10.235
in the Curious George
bouncy house.

16:10.364 --> 16:14.121
But apparently, my <i> dad</i> still
thinks of me as a little kid.

16:14.230 --> 16:16.918
Sue, if you want to talk
to Darrin, take it upstairs.

16:17.037 --> 16:19.032
I am not gonna be
the only one upstairs

16:19.130 --> 16:21.092
when we're at war
with the Glossners.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.778
They are capable of anything!

16:22.926 --> 16:25.616
Aw, man. I got to go
put on another pot.

16:25.757 --> 16:27.677
It's gonna be a long night.

16:27.850 --> 16:30.129
Brick, you don't work
for the pretzel company.

16:30.248 --> 16:31.816
They're not
counting on your ideas.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.235
Turn off the light
and go to bed.

16:33.345 --> 16:36.227
You just don't get it, dad.
You don't have a creative job.

16:36.337 --> 16:37.424
You don't, either!

16:37.557 --> 16:39.514
Look, I'm gonna get a call
from Corporate

16:39.626 --> 16:42.393
in St. Paul, Minnesota,
and I've got to deliver.

16:42.483 --> 16:44.188
You only get one shot
in this game, and if I blow it,

16:44.287 --> 16:46.698
it's gonna kill me
with the candy-bar people,

16:46.803 --> 16:49.031
the cereal people,
the popcorn people --

16:49.124 --> 16:51.507
Brick, I need to sleep.
I got to work tomorrow.

16:51.647 --> 16:54.613
God, I envy
how mindless your job is.

16:54.748 --> 16:57.975
I don't know.
I think the chimes are worse.

16:58.071 --> 16:59.973
Now there's a weird echo
'cause we're in the basement.

17:00.109 --> 17:02.499
Dad, Darrin would like
to speak to you personally.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.854
What? No. No!

17:03.979 --> 17:05.126
Good evening, Mr. Heck.

17:05.234 --> 17:06.849
You are the father of Sue,
and in most cases,

17:06.958 --> 17:09.231
I feel your parental decisions
have been right on the money.

17:09.316 --> 17:11.498
I mean, I think they're actually
worse down here.

17:11.603 --> 17:14.242
Seriously, are we just gonna
have to put up with this, Mike?

17:14.353 --> 17:16.585
But in this case, sir,
I feel you were overly stern.

17:16.692 --> 17:18.012
I mean, what are we gonna do
to get away from these chimes --

17:18.102 --> 17:19.497
live in the pool
and breathe through straws?

17:19.585 --> 17:21.951
Sue's a good girl. I believe
she earned the right to go out.

17:22.051 --> 17:24.423
So, this is our life -- bong,
bong, bong, clang, clang, clang!

17:24.516 --> 17:25.971
Work...ing!

17:26.054 --> 17:26.903
Okay, that's enough!

17:26.987 --> 17:28.035
You, turn off that lamp.

17:28.125 --> 17:29.907
You, no more computer talking.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.144
Turn off the lights.

17:31.213 --> 17:32.439
Everybody go to sleep!

17:39.639 --> 17:40.766
That's it!

17:48.815 --> 17:51.047
What the hell you doin'?

17:51.191 --> 17:52.066
You know what, Rita?

17:52.153 --> 17:53.183
We've had enough
of your wind chimes.

17:53.268 --> 17:54.601
We tried to do this
the nice way,

17:54.746 --> 17:56.159
but you pushed us too far.

17:58.046 --> 17:59.796
Aah! Ow!
What the hell?!

17:59.901 --> 18:02.123
"Ow, what the hell," you.

18:02.220 --> 18:04.247
Hey, now! I'm not looking
for any trouble.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.090
Damn it!

18:06.134 --> 18:07.503
That's not --
No --

18:07.598 --> 18:08.886
Ow! Owww!

18:09.007 --> 18:10.892
Hey, you're crazy!
You know that?!

18:10.975 --> 18:14.437
Oh, I'm crazy, stretch? Huh?
You like crazy, do ya?

18:14.517 --> 18:15.554
No!

18:15.765 --> 18:16.596
Aah!

18:24.172 --> 18:26.116
Oh, my God.

18:26.198 --> 18:27.256
What happened?

18:27.376 --> 18:28.849
She's a nut, Frankie.

18:28.982 --> 18:31.994
She literally went up a tree
and dropped on me like a cat.

18:32.851 --> 18:34.137
Well, I mean,
what did she expect?

18:34.235 --> 18:36.741
You had to go over there.
What were we supposed to do?

18:36.840 --> 18:39.672
We were all going crazy
with those wind chimes.

18:39.776 --> 18:42.144
That's the thing, Frankie --
I <i> wasn't.</i>

18:42.214 --> 18:43.348
I barely even heard
the damn things

18:43.442 --> 18:45.433
before you started
going on and on about them.

18:45.553 --> 18:47.423
But you started
yelling out windows

18:47.535 --> 18:48.697
and writing on stationery,

18:48.784 --> 18:50.788
and you got me
all riled up about it.

18:50.870 --> 18:52.761
What do you mean
<i>I</i> got you riled up?

18:52.870 --> 18:55.119
You rile me up
about everything.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.389
You riled me up about Sue.

18:56.493 --> 18:57.996
I didn't let her go
to a kid's party.

18:58.099 --> 19:01.115
I don't care if Sue goes
to a party. I trust Sue.

19:01.210 --> 19:02.539
Aww. Dad.

19:02.656 --> 19:03.583
You know what else?

19:03.706 --> 19:04.862
I didn't mind it
when the mailman

19:04.969 --> 19:07.558
wasn't bundling our mail
into rubber bands.

19:07.645 --> 19:08.685
But I yelled at him anyway.

19:08.791 --> 19:10.756
And I didn't care
when The Frugal Hoosier

19:10.853 --> 19:12.845
started charging
a nickel a bag,

19:12.962 --> 19:14.677
but I marched
into the manager's office,

19:14.760 --> 19:16.840
and I scared the hell
out of a 16-year-old boy.

19:16.955 --> 19:18.886
The truth is,
I don't mind <i> anything.</i>

19:18.993 --> 19:20.884
But <i> you</i> mind <i> everything,</i>

19:20.966 --> 19:22.746
so then <i> I</i> got to mind it,
and you know why?

19:22.835 --> 19:25.617
'Cause if mama ain't happy,
then <i> nobody's</i> happy.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.553
But I'm happy.

19:30.006 --> 19:33.060
And it's not like I told you
to <i> do</i> any of that stuff.

19:33.143 --> 19:33.953
Oh, really?

19:34.047 --> 19:36.083
So, when you tell me there's
a spider in the bathroom,

19:36.177 --> 19:38.090
y-y-you don't want me
to <i> do</i> anything.

19:38.161 --> 19:40.066
You're just giving me
the bug report.

19:40.151 --> 19:41.449
Look, I'm sorry.

19:41.590 --> 19:45.274
In my defense, I didn't even
know you were listening.

19:45.691 --> 19:46.964
So...

19:48.187 --> 19:49.952
you really
yelled at the mailman

19:50.042 --> 19:52.146
and that kid
at The Frugal Hoosier?

19:52.304 --> 19:53.973
I never knew you did that.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.811
That is so sweet!

19:55.899 --> 19:57.329
Well, it's not like
I come home bragging

19:57.442 --> 19:59.100
about who I yelled at that day.

19:59.197 --> 20:00.526
Are there others?

20:01.031 --> 20:02.774
I don't know.
Maybe.

20:03.942 --> 20:07.259
Well, this was fun,
but I got to get back to work.

20:07.353 --> 20:08.736
I'm in serious crunch time.

20:09.145 --> 20:10.344
Ohh.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.493
Crunch time.
It's not a new pretzel.

20:13.627 --> 20:16.008
It's a new way
of <i> thinking</i> about pretzels.

20:16.100 --> 20:18.352
I'm not product development.
I'm advertising.

20:18.463 --> 20:19.986
I'm a slogan man!

20:20.194 --> 20:21.644
I'm gonna need a piano.

20:23.521 --> 20:26.145
<i>So, Mike and I were resigned</i>
<i>to a life with wind chimes,</i>

20:26.283 --> 20:28.855
<i>and Axl was resigned</i>
<i>to a life with Kenny.</i>

20:28.957 --> 20:31.051
So, if you have a fridge,
that'd be great.

20:31.156 --> 20:33.067
Oh, and if we put ourselves
in the lottery,

20:33.189 --> 20:34.435
we might get
one of those big corner rooms,

20:34.544 --> 20:36.540
so... that'd be good.

20:36.624 --> 20:38.578
Plus, we already have
all of our inside jokes.

20:48.892 --> 20:50.786
There are two cushions
on this couch

20:50.935 --> 20:53.491
and three "Revenges"
on my phone!

20:58.933 --> 21:00.296
"Dear valued customer,

21:00.411 --> 21:03.105
thank you for your recent call
to our idea hotline.

21:03.196 --> 21:05.806
Please enjoy the enclosed
with our compliments."

21:07.320 --> 21:10.104
"10 cents off your next purchase
of Sutter Farms pretzels".

21:10.211 --> 21:11.907
My first paycheck!

21:15.305 --> 21:17.964
<i>That night, in addition</i>
<i>to the sound of wind chimes,</i>

21:18.101 --> 21:21.605
<i>I had a slightly more annoying</i>
<i>sound ringing in my ears --</i>

21:21.928 --> 21:24.018
<i>the sound of Mike being right.</i>

21:24.278 --> 21:25.415
<i>And he</i> was.

21:25.495 --> 21:27.133
<i>If I had left everything alone,</i>

21:27.229 --> 21:29.505
<i>the wind-chime problem would</i>
<i>have ten care of itself,</i>

21:29.650 --> 21:32.855
<i>'cause eventually the Glossners</i>
<i>take a bat to</i> everything.
