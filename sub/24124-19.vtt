WEBVTT

00:00.375 --> 00:03.416
I gotta get goin'

00:03.416 --> 00:07.000
a friend of mine

00:08.583 --> 00:11.416
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.083 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.583 --> 00:28.125
we're so adventurous

00:28.125 --> 00:31.250
and again

00:31.250 --> 00:34.875
and there's nobody home

00:34.875 --> 00:38.333
to count on a friend

00:38.333 --> 00:41.875
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.875 --> 00:45.375
take me, please?

00:45.375 --> 00:48.750
I got to be there

00:50.750 --> 00:56.000
Winnie the Pooh

01:09.625 --> 01:11.958
- Piglet: Oh, dear.

01:11.958 --> 01:15.708
It's v-very large
and very f-fierce.

01:15.708 --> 01:17.750
Christopher Robin:
Oh, Piglet.

01:17.750 --> 01:19.416
It's a magnifying glass.

01:19.416 --> 01:21.833
It just makes
things look big.

01:21.833 --> 01:26.375
Yeah. Even a very small you
is bigger than an ant--

01:26.375 --> 01:29.166
uh, a little bit anyway.

01:30.875 --> 01:32.875
Say, what's so funny?

01:34.166 --> 01:35.708
Wait a minute.

01:35.708 --> 01:38.375
Since when does ham
got leg?

01:38.375 --> 01:40.333
My picnic!

01:44.875 --> 01:47.250
- Yikes!
-

01:49.208 --> 01:52.458
Oh, d-dear. Help!

01:52.458 --> 01:55.625
Help!

01:55.625 --> 01:57.458
Oh, bother.

01:57.458 --> 02:00.125
It seems to be raining
picnic.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.416
Oh, d-d-dear.

02:03.416 --> 02:05.958
Help!

02:07.291 --> 02:09.291
Are you all right,
Piglet?

02:09.291 --> 02:13.250
Oh, how can an animal
as very small as myself

02:13.250 --> 02:15.250
make such a very large mess?

02:15.250 --> 02:18.375
Aw. It's okay, Piglet.

02:18.375 --> 02:22.583
No. I'm so small, I'm--
-- not even big.

02:22.583 --> 02:24.000
If I were big,

02:24.000 --> 02:25.875
those crows wouldn't
have me to kick around.

02:28.958 --> 02:30.583
Christopher Robin:
Poor Piglet.

02:30.583 --> 02:33.500
Yes. Poor Piglet.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.708
Yeah.
The poor little runt.

02:40.708 --> 02:44.333
I'd have to be twice my
size to even be small.

02:45.458 --> 02:47.250
--

02:47.250 --> 02:49.458
I were at least a--
--

02:49.458 --> 02:51.291
bit bigger.

02:51.291 --> 02:56.458
You know, I believe
I have a very small idea.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.083
Ouch!

03:29.000 --> 03:30.750
Oh, my.

03:30.750 --> 03:33.375
Something's
not quite right.

03:33.375 --> 03:35.500
Good morning, Piglet.

03:35.500 --> 03:39.750
Do you see that?
He's-- He's--

03:39.750 --> 03:41.583
He's humongousable.

03:41.583 --> 03:43.458
Piglet: What? B-B-But--

03:43.458 --> 03:46.333
I don't think I've
ever seen a piglet

03:46.333 --> 03:48.708
quite so, uh, tall
before.

03:48.708 --> 03:51.875
He's certainly bigger
than a bread basket now.

03:51.875 --> 03:55.333
Oh, dear. My wish came true.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.750
I am taller.

03:58.291 --> 04:02.375
Pooh: Piglet, you're
even bigger than the trees.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.250
I am, aren't I?

04:05.416 --> 04:07.958
Trees, schmees.

04:07.958 --> 04:09.208
I'm pooped.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.000
Piglet, stop!

04:15.000 --> 04:16.083
Why, Pooh?

04:16.083 --> 04:17.833
You have to stop

04:17.833 --> 04:19.708
because
the ground has stopped.

04:19.708 --> 04:23.708
The rest of it is very...
down there.

04:23.708 --> 04:27.208
Pooh, this is nothing
more than a little ditch.

04:27.208 --> 04:29.708
Just watch how easily
I can leap over it.

04:29.708 --> 04:32.000
Oh, no.

05:08.958 --> 05:10.416
Let me take care
of this pebble, Rabbit.

05:10.416 --> 05:13.708
A small animal such as
yourself might get hurt.

05:13.708 --> 05:16.375
I'd really appreciate that.

05:22.083 --> 05:27.875
My, you're so big
and...strong.

05:27.875 --> 05:30.458
Oh, it's nothing,
little friend.

05:30.458 --> 05:31.500
Where shall I put it?

05:31.500 --> 05:33.875
Uh, little friend, indeed.

05:33.875 --> 05:37.583
Oh, anywhere's, uh, fine.

05:40.291 --> 05:41.583
Whoo!

05:41.583 --> 05:44.166
Oh, dear. I threw it so far,

05:44.166 --> 05:45.833
even I can't see it.

05:45.833 --> 05:48.291
Well, if there's anything
else I can do for you,

05:48.291 --> 05:49.291
just call.

05:49.291 --> 05:51.000
No.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.333
You've done quite enough.

05:54.458 --> 05:55.708
Thank you.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.583
And what do you think
you're doing

06:01.583 --> 06:05.166
in the garden of my very
small friend Rabbit?

06:05.166 --> 06:06.875
Piglet! No!

06:06.875 --> 06:10.958
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size,

06:10.958 --> 06:12.000
small as it is?

06:19.291 --> 06:21.208
Oh, d-d-dear.

06:21.208 --> 06:24.000
I'm not so very larger
as I thought I was.

06:28.458 --> 06:31.000
Oh, dear!

06:34.583 --> 06:37.875
But, Piglet, we tried
our best to help.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.458
We was only
trying to do it
for your own good.

06:40.458 --> 06:43.458
Well, good is just
to go away-- --

06:43.458 --> 06:46.375
so you won't have
to waste your time on me.

06:46.375 --> 06:49.708
I'm just too small
to be around.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.208
We can't just let him go.

06:55.208 --> 06:58.750
I'm afraid his little
mind is made up.

06:59.875 --> 07:04.166
Smallness
has come between us.

07:04.166 --> 07:07.000
I'm sorry, Pooh.
It's over.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.625
He's just a teensy-weensy
memory.

07:11.625 --> 07:14.708
But I can't do
without him.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.875
He is my best friend,
after all.

07:18.625 --> 07:21.083
There's only one thing
to do.

07:21.083 --> 07:23.458
Uh, you'll need
another best friend.

07:23.458 --> 07:26.625
Of course. We'll
get a new Piglet.

07:26.625 --> 07:29.000
A new Piglet?

07:29.000 --> 07:32.708
But I'd rather have
the old one instead.

07:32.708 --> 07:35.833
Oh, don't worry,
buddy bear. Ha ha ha ha!

07:35.833 --> 07:39.000
When we get done, you won't
know the difference.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.875
It wouldn't be so bad
if I used to be tall,

07:41.875 --> 07:43.083
but I've been small

07:43.083 --> 07:44.958
ever since I was
knee-high to a...

07:44.958 --> 07:46.375
knee.

07:46.375 --> 07:48.708
Whoa!

07:48.708 --> 07:52.208
Why, if you looked up
"tiny" in the dictionary,

07:52.208 --> 07:54.583
you'd find a picture of me.

07:54.583 --> 07:57.875
If I hadn't have seen it
with my own two eyes,

07:57.875 --> 08:00.375
I never
would have seen it.

08:01.708 --> 08:05.958
My, the resemblance
is, uh, amazing.

08:05.958 --> 08:09.625
Ought to work out just fine.

08:09.625 --> 08:14.458
Doesn't he seem to be
a bit large for a piglet?

08:14.458 --> 08:17.416
You know, fuzz boy's
got a point.

08:17.416 --> 08:20.875
Piglet wasn't so...
round.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.166
Well, there's only
one thing to do.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.958
We'll have to shrink him.

08:28.458 --> 08:31.250
Just once I'd like to hear

08:31.250 --> 08:34.125
"My, Piglet, how you've grown"

08:34.125 --> 08:37.708
or "Why, Piglet, you've
shot up like a weed."

08:39.125 --> 08:41.166
But no. Everyone's
always talking

08:41.166 --> 08:43.333
about how small I am.

08:43.333 --> 08:46.000
"Would you care
for alittletea, Piglet?"

08:46.000 --> 08:49.583
"How about asmallsmackerel
of honey, Piglet?"

08:49.583 --> 08:52.750
Ohh, it's so frustrating.

08:52.750 --> 08:56.166
Well?
Has he shrunk yet?

08:57.625 --> 08:59.750
Hmm...

08:59.750 --> 09:01.000
no.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.458
Oh, this isn't working.

09:03.458 --> 09:05.083
Let's get him out.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.875
Say, you know something?

09:12.875 --> 09:14.750
I think he's about to--

09:14.750 --> 09:19.333
Yaah!

09:19.333 --> 09:20.500
...do that.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.458
I know. Let's have

09:22.458 --> 09:25.583
a "Welcome home,
Piglet" party,

09:25.583 --> 09:27.458
and then
he'll have to be home.

09:30.750 --> 09:33.458
Help me! Help me!

09:33.458 --> 09:36.166
You're not the size
that is standard, Piglet.

09:36.166 --> 09:39.166
There's simply nothing
you can do for anyone.

09:39.166 --> 09:42.833
You're just a tiny
waste of space.

09:42.833 --> 09:43.875
Ant: Hey!

09:51.708 --> 09:54.333
- Why, w-what's this?

09:56.500 --> 09:58.375
For m-m-me?

09:58.375 --> 10:00.875
Aw, you don't need to
thank me for helping you.

10:00.875 --> 10:05.166
I only did it because you're
all so very, very small and--

10:05.166 --> 10:07.083
and, uh...

10:07.083 --> 10:11.250
why, youarevery,
very small, aren't you?

10:17.458 --> 10:22.000
Oh, boy. This isn't a very
celebrationish celebration.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.458
It's rather hard having
a "Welcome home, Piglet" party

10:26.458 --> 10:31.375
when there's no Piglet
to welcome home.

10:31.375 --> 10:34.208
If only we know
where Piglet lived now.

10:34.208 --> 10:39.208
Then we could go there
and, uh, welcome him home.

10:39.208 --> 10:41.958
Piglet: But, Pooh,
I live here. Heh heh heh.

10:41.958 --> 10:43.375
All: Piglet!

10:43.375 --> 10:45.458
- Welcome home, Piglet!
-

10:45.458 --> 10:48.708
- Oh, he's home! He's back!
- Hooray for Piglet.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.375
But what changed
your mind, Piglet?

10:57.375 --> 11:02.583
I mean, you haven't really,
uh, g-grown a-a-any, hmm?

11:02.583 --> 11:05.833
What he means to say
is you're still, uh,

11:05.833 --> 11:09.000
you're still,
you know, the same size.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.708
Yes, I am. Ha ha.

11:11.708 --> 11:13.708
I just finally
realized something.

11:13.708 --> 11:16.416
There's small,
and there's very small,

11:16.416 --> 11:19.583
and there's very, very small.

11:19.583 --> 11:21.583
And it really doesn't
matter what you are.

11:21.583 --> 11:23.583
Pooh: That's right,
Piglet.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.125
Even if you are
smaller than some,

11:26.125 --> 11:29.000
you have the biggest
heart around.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.750
Whoopee! He be back!

11:34.750 --> 11:37.583
Hooray for Piglet!
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

11:50.583 --> 11:54.000
Sure would be nice
being a cloud--

11:54.000 --> 11:56.125
moving slow,

11:56.125 --> 11:58.708
nothing to worry about.

11:58.708 --> 12:02.000
Wish I could just
float on by.

12:04.375 --> 12:07.583
Too bad donkeys don't float.

12:14.833 --> 12:16.958
Toot toot!

12:18.500 --> 12:21.458
Chug chug chug.

12:22.583 --> 12:23.958
Shark!

12:28.750 --> 12:30.208
Yikes!

12:32.333 --> 12:34.000
Aah!

12:41.833 --> 12:43.000
Huh?

12:48.708 --> 12:50.083
Yaah!

12:58.708 --> 12:59.833
Yikes!

13:02.208 --> 13:05.583
Suffering salmon,
I'm in for it now.

13:05.583 --> 13:10.000
It's the 50-year migration
of the muttonhead trout!

13:10.000 --> 13:12.625
Must have built my tunnel
on the wrong riverbed.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.500
Yaah! Smack-dab in their path.

13:16.500 --> 13:21.958
They're heading upstream!

13:21.958 --> 13:24.083
Hmm. Whop!

13:24.083 --> 13:28.375
By dinghy, this place is
gonna be downright unlivable

13:28.375 --> 13:30.875
till this thing blows over.

13:32.416 --> 13:34.291
Out! Out! Out!

13:34.291 --> 13:36.750
Fish, fish, fish.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.583
- Now what?

13:49.291 --> 13:50.708
Hiya, Rabbit!

13:50.708 --> 13:53.708
Looks like you and me
are gonna be roomies.

13:53.708 --> 13:56.458
I've been run out of my place
by a bunch of fish.

13:56.458 --> 14:00.583
More trout than you can
shake a fish stick at.

14:00.583 --> 14:01.625
But I--

14:01.625 --> 14:03.583
Hmm, there.

14:03.583 --> 14:05.583
All the comforts of home.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.958
Gopher, would you mind--

14:07.958 --> 14:10.750
Why, of course, sonny.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.875
Since I'm gonna be here
a few months,

14:12.875 --> 14:16.416
I'd be glad to get this dump
looking halfway decent.

14:16.416 --> 14:18.083
Gopher, no!

14:18.083 --> 14:19.833
You got this great view,

14:19.833 --> 14:22.125
but, uh, you're not
taking advantage of it.

14:22.125 --> 14:25.166
There. Don't get
vistas like that

14:25.166 --> 14:26.958
when you live underground.

14:28.458 --> 14:31.083
Just look what he's done
to my beautiful home.

14:31.083 --> 14:34.875
And he's going to be here
until the trout migration
is over.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.333
I have to get him
out of my house

14:37.333 --> 14:39.958
while I still have a house
to get him out of.

14:41.458 --> 14:44.125
Pooh, why are there
so very many trout

14:44.125 --> 14:46.458
around these days?

14:46.458 --> 14:48.750
They're going
upstream, Piglet,

14:48.750 --> 14:53.000
uh, to do whatever
it is fish do upstream.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.458
Only they're going
upstream the wrong way:

14:56.458 --> 14:58.375
through Gopher's house.

14:58.375 --> 15:02.125
Ah! Why, yes. That's it.

15:02.125 --> 15:05.750
His tunnels. We'll clear
them out of his tunnels.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.208
Hoo hoo!
Then he can do home.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.583
But, Rabbit,
how would we do that?

15:10.583 --> 15:13.625
We'll go in after them,
that's how.

15:13.625 --> 15:18.583
Yaah!

15:19.833 --> 15:22.166
Yes, sir, roomie.

15:22.166 --> 15:24.166
You're a
one-in-a-million friend,

15:24.166 --> 15:26.708
trying to save
my home like this.

15:26.708 --> 15:30.625
Oh, I'm glad to do it, Gopher.

15:30.625 --> 15:35.708
This guy's a gem,
a jewel, true-blue.

15:35.708 --> 15:38.250
Don't know how I'm
going to repay you.

15:38.250 --> 15:39.708
- Ohh!
-

15:39.708 --> 15:42.583
I hear something.
Listen.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.708
- Dot dash dot dot

15:46.833 --> 15:50.166
It's a secret trout code.
They know we're here!

15:50.166 --> 15:52.458
We're surrounded!
It's-- It's--

15:52.458 --> 15:54.708
- It's only Piglet's knees.
-

15:54.708 --> 15:56.416
But that isn't.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.083
Get them! Here, Piglet.

16:02.083 --> 16:04.875
Ha! Got one!
Here, Piglet!

16:06.208 --> 16:07.500
Here, Piglet.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.375
Piglet, this is no
laughing matter.

16:18.375 --> 16:20.083
You're letting them get away!

16:24.291 --> 16:26.291
Oh, oh, whah!

16:33.000 --> 16:35.875
There has to be
a better way.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.458
I got it!

16:37.458 --> 16:40.500
Grab a hammer and follow me.

16:42.833 --> 16:46.708
Hmm. There. That'll
hold up against anything.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.458
Including us.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.708
How are we
supposed to get out?

16:54.416 --> 16:56.583
Going up.

17:02.166 --> 17:06.583
Excuse me, Rabbit,
but it seems to be raining--

17:06.583 --> 17:07.583
fish.

17:07.583 --> 17:09.166
Raining fish?

17:09.166 --> 17:10.708
We're flooded with them.

17:10.708 --> 17:12.125
We're-- We're--

17:12.125 --> 17:14.208
Ah. That's it.

17:14.208 --> 17:15.708
Rain.

17:15.708 --> 17:17.000
We'll make it rain.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.125
We'll
flood those flounders

17:19.125 --> 17:21.375
right out of Gopher's
tunnels! Ha ha!

17:21.375 --> 17:24.958
Flood them? Ha!
Did you hear that?

17:24.958 --> 17:26.708
Genius, I tell you.

17:26.708 --> 17:28.750
That bunny's a genius.

17:28.750 --> 17:31.458
What a pal.
What a friend and a half!

17:31.458 --> 17:35.458
I wonder what he'll
think of next!

17:37.333 --> 17:39.750
Eeyore: Why me?

17:39.750 --> 17:43.750
Because no one knows more
about clouds than you do.

17:43.750 --> 17:48.208
Now remember, pour this water
all over them, Eeyore.

17:49.708 --> 17:52.833
It will make the clouds
think rainy thoughts.

17:55.166 --> 17:56.583
Ready?

17:56.583 --> 17:58.083
Well...

17:58.083 --> 17:59.166
Hawmp!

18:16.375 --> 18:17.458
There.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.875
Rain. Rain!

18:30.875 --> 18:32.500
It worked! It worked!

18:33.500 --> 18:35.291
Have to imagine

18:35.291 --> 18:38.583
this isn't gonna
turn out too well.

18:38.583 --> 18:42.166
Though they are
kind of springy.

18:42.166 --> 18:45.708
Even better than I'd expected.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.208
Sure is nice.

18:48.208 --> 18:52.500
Aw, don't feel bad,
roomie. You tried.

18:52.500 --> 18:55.000
This just means
we'll have more time

18:55.000 --> 18:56.708
to spend together.

18:56.708 --> 18:59.875
No, no! It can't be!
It has to rain!

18:59.875 --> 19:01.500
Ohh! It has to! Ohh!

19:06.875 --> 19:08.291
What is that?

19:11.875 --> 19:14.875
Talk about your slipshod
construction.

19:14.875 --> 19:16.458
Try putting in a basement,

19:16.458 --> 19:18.458
and the whole place
comes down.

19:18.458 --> 19:22.083
Take it! Take my house!
It's yours!

19:22.083 --> 19:24.166
I'll go live with Pooh
or Piglet

19:24.166 --> 19:27.708
or Ee-- Ee...Eeyore.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.458
Oh, my. I forgot about Eeyore!

19:33.333 --> 19:36.583
Well, should have
seen it coming.

19:36.583 --> 19:39.291
Overstayed my welcome.

19:40.291 --> 19:43.708
Got the clouds mad at me.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.250
Hawmp!

19:46.250 --> 19:48.416
Oh, my! This is terrible!

19:49.458 --> 19:50.625
Hawmp!

19:50.625 --> 19:52.750
How could I have been
so thoughtless?

19:52.750 --> 19:54.708
Quick, pull him in.

20:01.250 --> 20:04.833
I-- I--
There's no Eeyore.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.416
Eeyore!

20:06.416 --> 20:07.958
- Eeyore!
- Here, Eeyore!

20:07.958 --> 20:09.416
Hey, where are you?

20:09.416 --> 20:12.291
Is that me you're looking for?

20:12.291 --> 20:15.375
Or have you already
found a new friend

20:15.375 --> 20:17.708
by the same name?

20:17.708 --> 20:20.500
Eeyore, you have to
come down from there.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.458
Love to.

20:22.458 --> 20:24.000
But how?

20:24.000 --> 20:27.291
Oh, my. What will we do?

20:27.291 --> 20:28.875
It would seem to me

20:28.875 --> 20:31.208
that the best way
to get Eeyore down

20:31.208 --> 20:34.708
would be to get
the cloud down.

20:34.708 --> 20:38.375
Why, Pooh, for a bear
of very little brain,

20:38.375 --> 20:41.833
you're a genius,
an absolute genius.

20:43.250 --> 20:45.958
That was a very good
idea, Pooh.

20:47.583 --> 20:49.250
What was?

20:54.875 --> 20:56.083
Pull!

20:59.000 --> 21:00.625
Yaah!

21:00.625 --> 21:02.083
Quickly! The kite!

21:10.208 --> 21:12.625
Eeyore,
are you all right?

21:12.625 --> 21:17.083
About as well
as can be expected

21:17.083 --> 21:21.458
for somebody who's just
fallen off a cloud.

21:21.458 --> 21:24.750
Rabbit, look. The tunnel
is filling with water.

21:24.750 --> 21:27.708
Why, yes. Yes.
It's working.

21:27.708 --> 21:30.083
Eeyore! You did it!

21:30.083 --> 21:32.833
It's a success!
It's a success!

21:32.833 --> 21:35.416
The fish
are swimming upstream.

21:35.416 --> 21:37.291
As soon as the water
clears out,

21:37.291 --> 21:38.875
you can move back home.

21:38.875 --> 21:40.875
Yes, sir.

21:40.875 --> 21:45.000
Everything's gonna be fine
for a while.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.875
For a-- a while?

21:46.875 --> 21:49.583
Mm-hmm. Until
the muttonhead trout

21:49.583 --> 21:52.083
start heading back
downstream.

21:52.083 --> 21:54.708
Downstream? Downstream?

21:54.708 --> 21:56.375
Ah ha ha ha ha! Whah!

21:56.375 --> 21:58.583
It's perfect!
It's perfect! Ha ha ha!

21:58.583 --> 22:01.875
I'm a fish! Ha ha ha!

22:01.875 --> 22:04.416
I'm a fish!
I'm a muttonhead trout!

22:04.416 --> 22:05.625
Ha ha ha!

22:05.625 --> 22:06.833
Ah ha ha!

22:06.833 --> 22:08.750
Hey, everybody, wait for me!

22:08.750 --> 22:13.708
Wait for me! Wait for me!
