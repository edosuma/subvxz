00:01.929 --> 00:04.419
- Previously:
- I'm gonna have a son.

00:09.130 --> 00:11.089
I have a roommate. He's a ghost.

00:11.529 --> 00:13.320
When I see you
and Cordelia sparring...

00:13.929 --> 00:17.089
...it's only natural you and she
will be drawn to one another.

00:17.530 --> 00:20.649
She doesn't choose to have a vision.
The Powers send them.

00:21.129 --> 00:22.250
I look forward to my next vision.

00:24.730 --> 00:25.890
You gonna be okay?

00:26.530 --> 00:28.210
These visions are killing me.

00:28.329 --> 00:31.309
If I lose the visions,
I wouldn't be able to help you.

00:31.929 --> 00:33.049
You wouldn't need me.

00:35.530 --> 00:38.759
I'd just like to say thank you.

00:40.329 --> 00:43.240
You believed in me
when no one else would.

00:43.929 --> 00:46.350
In my darkest hours,
you were there for me...

00:46.929 --> 00:50.299
...and that means more to me
than you'll ever know.

00:51.130 --> 00:55.520
I guess what I'm really
trying to say is, I love you.

00:57.729 --> 01:00.219
To all my fans, this is for you!

01:01.929 --> 01:03.859
Wow! That was just....

01:04.328 --> 01:07.209
Wow. And with the tears....

01:07.930 --> 01:09.890
I got chill bumps all up my arms.

01:10.930 --> 01:13.670
Yep, that's the famous speech.

01:14.530 --> 01:16.670
Not that I'll ever use it, of course.

01:16.930 --> 01:21.140
Unless they start handing out
awards for best slime and grime.

01:22.930 --> 01:25.950
Next time Angel decides
to blow something up...

01:26.530 --> 01:28.810
...he's cleaning his own scorch marks.

01:28.930 --> 01:31.209
Ladies, less yammer and more scrub.

01:31.930 --> 01:33.579
My, Gunn...

01:33.730 --> 01:35.239
...don't you look sterile.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.849
Couple more hours sniffing
that cleanser, and I might be.

01:40.329 --> 01:41.700
You wanna trade jobs?

01:42.129 --> 01:45.540
Scrape up Wolfram and Hart's
entrails off floor. Fred?

01:46.329 --> 01:48.859
You're screwed.

01:51.730 --> 01:52.920
- Wes back yet?
- Nope.

01:53.530 --> 01:57.180
He's still picking up more
extra-strength ick remover.

01:59.530 --> 02:01.560
Look who's up from his nap.

02:01.930 --> 02:03.439
Connor.

02:05.530 --> 02:08.689
Whoa, whoa.
Dirty people not touching the baby.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.259
But pig-drinking
bloodsuckers are okay?

02:12.729 --> 02:15.539
I meant that in a nice way.
I'm washing my hands.

02:15.729 --> 02:17.550
I get first dibs
on baby snuggles.

02:18.129 --> 02:21.539
Don't forget to get under your
fingernails. Does she know?

02:23.530 --> 02:24.400
Where is she?

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074

02:51.129 --> 02:53.340
You guys,
I can't believe you did this.

02:54.129 --> 02:57.360
Don't just stand there,
blow out the candles, girl.

02:59.530 --> 03:00.789
Yeah!

03:01.330 --> 03:04.449
- Did you make a wish?
- I did. Jude Law was busy?

03:04.930 --> 03:06.120
How disappointing.

03:06.729 --> 03:10.909
- Guess you won't be wanting presents--
- Oh, wanting. Wanting presents.

03:12.729 --> 03:15.680
- Do you want to hold the baby now?
- Let me have him.

03:16.330 --> 03:21.879
Thank you. Oh, honey.

03:23.530 --> 03:24.759
I, uh....

03:25.930 --> 03:28.419
I got you a little something.

03:30.129 --> 03:33.150
You didn't have to.
You have enough to take care of.

03:33.729 --> 03:36.889
Well, I'm a champion.
We do important stuff.

03:37.330 --> 03:40.699
- Who's more important than--?
- Forgive the wrapping.

03:41.530 --> 03:44.370
Some of us seem to have
an addiction to tape.

03:44.530 --> 03:49.030
What a cruel dilemma.
Presents or sweet little baby?

03:51.729 --> 03:54.360
- Take the baby.
- You choose gifts over my kid?

03:54.729 --> 03:57.539
Take the baby. Take the baby!

04:01.330 --> 04:03.500
It's a teenager. A girl. She's....

04:08.530 --> 04:09.580
Cordy!

04:12.729 --> 04:14.099
Is she all right?

04:16.930 --> 04:19.350
- I'm fine, you guys.
- Cordy?

04:19.930 --> 04:23.019
I'll be okay. I'm just....

04:23.529 --> 04:26.410
- Can you hear me?
- Is she breathing?

04:27.129 --> 04:28.360
Dead?

05:21.850 --> 05:23.149
Oh, no.

05:23.649 --> 05:24.879
Take him.

05:24.850 --> 05:27.310
Come on, Cordy, wake up.
It's all over.

05:27.850 --> 05:30.310
- Come back to us.
- I haven't gone anywhere.

05:30.850 --> 05:31.829
- Wake up.
- Is she--?

05:32.050 --> 05:33.660
- No!
- I'm not?

05:34.449 --> 05:37.079
- Her heart's beating.
- Yes!

05:37.449 --> 05:40.500
- But if I'm not dead--
- She's in a trance, or a coma.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.579
- Like hell I am!
- Let's get her to the couch.

05:44.050 --> 05:46.680
- Easy. Easy
- All right.

05:49.449 --> 05:52.540
Okay, I get it.

05:53.050 --> 05:56.910
This is some kind of bizarre birthday
present you guys cooked up.

05:57.850 --> 06:00.800
All right, joke's on me.
Now put me back in my body.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.209
It was a vision, wasn't it?

06:05.649 --> 06:07.930
She started saying something
about a girl and--

06:08.050 --> 06:11.490
That's right. She's in a house
on Oak Street in Reseda.

06:12.250 --> 06:15.199
It feels like we have
some time here, but....

06:15.850 --> 06:18.620
You can't hear me at all, can you?

06:19.449 --> 06:22.750
- What's all the hubbub, bub?
- Lorne. Thank God.

06:23.050 --> 06:28.250
If there's some weird other worldly
thing going on, you'd still be able to--

06:29.050 --> 06:32.980
Oh, that's not good.
Did anybody else just see that?

06:33.850 --> 06:36.939
- Jumping Judas, what happened?
- We know she had a vision.

06:37.449 --> 06:40.050
There's a lot we don't know.
She dropped this.

06:40.449 --> 06:42.449
Put that away.
That's not important.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.529
- Seltrax.
- Oh, God.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.790
- What's Seltrax?
- Nothing.

06:47.050 --> 06:49.120
It's a powerful migraine medication.

06:49.449 --> 06:53.279
- We should get her to a hospital.
- So they can tell us there's no hope?

06:54.250 --> 06:58.290
Angel's right. Seltrax is potent,
but it doesn't cause catatonia.

06:59.050 --> 07:01.509
I'm picking up some hard-core
woo-woo vibes.

07:02.050 --> 07:04.509
This ain't medical, kids.
It's mystical.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.370
There's so much we don't know.

07:08.050 --> 07:10.860
If she's taking a drug
this powerful in secret...

07:11.050 --> 07:13.610
...the visions are more damaging
than she lets on.

07:14.050 --> 07:17.209
- This one must've overloaded her.
- She'll come out of it.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.459
- She will!
- If it's a mystical problem...

07:20.649 --> 07:23.139
- ...there's a mystical solution.
- Great idea.

07:23.649 --> 07:28.000
- Gunn and Fred, go to Cordy's place.
- No! Bad idea. Bad idea.

07:29.050 --> 07:31.399
See if she's been hiding anything.
Wes?

07:31.449 --> 07:33.589
- I'll hit the books.
- I'll take the peanut.

07:34.449 --> 07:36.769
Does nobody care
that there is a girl in Reseda...

07:36.850 --> 07:40.680
...that is about to be fed
to a no-eyed, three-mouth monster?

07:42.850 --> 07:44.149
What?

07:46.449 --> 07:47.750
Hello?

07:50.649 --> 07:53.490
A message. I'll leave a message.

08:04.649 --> 08:06.680
I think Phantom Dennis
expected the birthday girl.

08:07.050 --> 08:09.050
Hi, there.

08:09.449 --> 08:11.910
I know we haven't been
formally introduced.

08:12.449 --> 08:15.860
I'm not sure how to introduce
myself to someone who's...

08:16.649 --> 08:20.060
...you know, former. But, I'm Fred.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.930
It's nice to meet you.

08:22.649 --> 08:24.819
Fred, you are so cool.

08:26.850 --> 08:29.170
I think we should tell him.

08:29.250 --> 08:30.480
Okay.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.860
You might wanna....

08:34.049 --> 08:35.909
Do ghosts sit down?

08:37.049 --> 08:39.259
Wesley. Wesley.

08:40.049 --> 08:41.909
Wesley! Yoo-hoo!

08:42.450 --> 08:46.909
But if she's in the astral plane, she
could be here, unable to communicate.

08:47.250 --> 08:50.940
Yeah, here. Unable to communicate.

08:55.649 --> 08:58.279
"Astral Projection." I should read up.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.070
Wait, don't turn--

09:01.649 --> 09:04.320
- It doesn't make any sense.
- What doesn't?

09:04.649 --> 09:06.049
It's all...

09:07.049 --> 09:08.450
...normal.

09:09.450 --> 09:11.519
- And that's wrong?
- No.

09:13.049 --> 09:16.600
What's wrong is you picking
through Cordy's personal...

09:17.850 --> 09:19.360
...support things.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.549
What, this?

09:21.450 --> 09:23.700
Come on, you never hid anything
in your underwear drawer?

09:24.450 --> 09:28.799
I don't know. I mean, for five years
I didn't even have--

09:30.450 --> 09:33.220
Can we not talk about
my underwear, please?

09:33.450 --> 09:35.059
And put that down.

09:37.049 --> 09:39.649
If Cordy was taking
something like Seltrax...

09:40.049 --> 09:42.370
...she'd have tried other stuff first.

09:43.049 --> 09:46.029
But there's not even any aspirin
in here.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.639
I think he's protecting her.

09:57.450 --> 09:58.919
Phantom Dennis?

09:59.250 --> 10:02.480
Listen, we would never ask you
to betray Cordelia...

10:02.850 --> 10:05.870
...but we need to see whatever
she's been hiding--

10:06.450 --> 10:11.509
Unless you so hype on the ghosting
life that you want her to join you.

10:19.649 --> 10:23.509
You looked through the underwear
drawer first, didn't you?

10:25.049 --> 10:26.870
The date on this prescription...

10:27.450 --> 10:29.700
...it's from a year ago.

10:35.450 --> 10:41.029
Cordy, look, I know you can't hear me,
but there's something I have to say.

10:47.450 --> 10:49.870
You really piss me off, you know that?

10:50.450 --> 10:53.860
I thought we trusted each other,
but you've been lying. MRIs?

10:54.649 --> 10:57.139
CAT scans?
It's been going on for over a year?

10:57.649 --> 11:00.740
Why couldn't you let me in?
I could've helped you.

11:02.450 --> 11:05.220
- God, you make me so furious.
- You're furious?

11:06.049 --> 11:10.649
I get body-jacked on my birthday,
and you're the one that's furious?

11:13.250 --> 11:14.580
Knock-knock.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.049
- How is she?
- The same.

11:17.450 --> 11:19.169
- You ready?
- As I'll ever be.

11:19.850 --> 11:21.110
For what?

11:22.250 --> 11:25.269
- What's he gonna do?
- I wish I'd brought my helmet.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.200
Last time I got blown across the room.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.639
Oh, God, please let this work.

11:39.049 --> 11:41.399
Cordelia, are you there?

11:41.450 --> 11:43.940
It's me, Lorne. I'm here.

11:45.649 --> 11:47.580
- Cordelia?
- Yes!

11:48.049 --> 11:50.580
171 Oak Street.

11:51.649 --> 11:54.039
Can you hear me? Lorne?

11:57.049 --> 11:59.220
- What?
- Cordelia's not in there.

12:00.049 --> 12:04.049
- She's just gone.
- I'm standing right in front of you.

12:07.850 --> 12:11.779
- Listen, I'm afraid.
- No. This isn't gonna happen.

12:12.649 --> 12:16.019
I don't care how many favors
you call in or gods you cross.

12:16.250 --> 12:19.759
You're connected to The Powers That
Be. Find me a way to talk to them.

12:20.450 --> 12:23.220
Angel, honey, it's not that easy.

12:24.049 --> 12:28.049
Contacting The Powers is a muddy,
not to mention dangerous, area.

12:28.850 --> 12:31.480
But this is a bit much to ask.

12:31.850 --> 12:33.600
I'm not asking.

13:00.490 --> 13:01.860
Finally!

13:02.889 --> 13:06.649
Okay, Wes, let's hope your books
know what they're talking about.

13:49.690 --> 13:54.080
Listen up, whatever you are!
You can't scare me.

13:55.090 --> 13:57.440
Angel. I just--

13:58.690 --> 14:02.730
- Why are you on the floor?
- I had this dream that Cordy was here.

14:03.490 --> 14:06.820
She was trying to tell me something.
Something important.

14:07.090 --> 14:10.279
- Yes, and, and....
- It's weird.

14:11.289 --> 14:15.049
How are you a champion?
In what way are you a champion?

14:16.090 --> 14:18.970
Fred studied Cordy's CAT scans.
The news isn't good.

14:19.090 --> 14:22.070
They show widespread
neuroelectrical deterioration.

14:22.690 --> 14:26.240
- That's just a fancy way of saying--
- She's dying.

14:31.690 --> 14:33.970
I think I like the fancy way better.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.090
I'm working on the mystical aspect.

14:36.490 --> 14:39.610
Trance states, astral projection,
spiritual possession.

14:40.090 --> 14:42.509
But so far, I haven't been able to....

14:43.690 --> 14:47.450
Why don't you take a break?
I'll watch her and Connor.

14:52.090 --> 14:53.980
I'm not ready yet.

15:05.889 --> 15:06.830
No.

15:17.289 --> 15:19.570
Hey. How's it going?

15:26.490 --> 15:27.860
You're....

15:30.090 --> 15:32.230
You're Death?

15:33.690 --> 15:35.649
You've come to take me.

15:37.889 --> 15:39.710
Kidding. I'm Skip.

15:40.889 --> 15:45.029
You're Cordelia Chase, right?
Sorry it took me so long-- This you?

15:49.889 --> 15:54.389
Most people's spiritual shapes tend to
be an idealized version of themselves.

15:55.289 --> 15:59.570
Straighten the nose, lose the gray.
Sort of a self-esteem kind of thing.

16:00.090 --> 16:01.490
You're pretty confident.

16:01.889 --> 16:05.220
What is this? Who are you?
What the hell is going on?!

16:06.090 --> 16:07.840
You got questions. I get that.

16:07.889 --> 16:10.490
I'll answer them.
But we gotta get out of here.

16:10.889 --> 16:14.720
But why? Here's good.
I feel comfortable here. I like here.

16:15.690 --> 16:20.259
But you see, there's a slight problem.
You don't belong here anymore.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.720
- Because I'm dead?
- Not yet.

16:24.690 --> 16:27.039
But you will be, very soon.

16:27.690 --> 16:30.360
Unless you come with me.

16:33.690 --> 16:36.809
Well, I'll follow you
on one condition.

16:37.289 --> 16:39.850
Tell my friends about
this vision that I had.

16:40.889 --> 16:45.389
Sorry, no can do. I'm not a messenger,
I'm just a guide.

16:51.090 --> 16:53.899
- I don't want to die.
- So don't.

17:02.490 --> 17:04.210
That's from eight months ago.

17:04.289 --> 17:06.960
The red spots, or what
they call hot areas...

17:07.890 --> 17:11.220
...are what you'd expect
from a healthy, functioning brain.

17:11.490 --> 17:15.700
- This one is dated one month ago.
- Cordy's doctors couldn't explain it.

17:16.890 --> 17:22.118
See, green is a cold color, usually
signifying dead areas of the cerebrum.

17:22.890 --> 17:26.930
- Normally, you wouldn't see that--
- Unless the person was a cucumber.

17:27.690 --> 17:29.650
How could we not know?

17:30.690 --> 17:34.309
For the love of God,
somebody get me a Sea Breeze.

17:34.890 --> 17:37.980
- Lorne, what happened?
- I can't really talk about it.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.589
Then how we supposed to find them?

17:40.890 --> 17:43.700
I mean, I can't talk about it.
They cast a spell.

17:44.490 --> 17:47.970
I went down to the--
See?

17:48.690 --> 17:52.519
- Did you get the information?
- Why, yes. My horn should grow back.

17:52.890 --> 17:55.059
So kind of you to be concerned.

17:55.890 --> 17:58.559
Well, they didn't say
I couldn't write it.

18:00.089 --> 18:02.859
All kidding aside,
this isn't to be taken lightly.

18:03.690 --> 18:07.170
Only a champion can deal with
the Conduit. Even then, you--

18:07.890 --> 18:09.890
I'll keep that in mind.

18:15.450 --> 18:16.890
Is this...?

18:18.450 --> 18:21.079
- This is a mall.
- We figured you'd be comfortable.

18:21.450 --> 18:22.680
- We?
- The Powers That Be.

18:23.250 --> 18:27.039
The Powers That Be popped me out
of my body and sent me to a mall?

18:27.450 --> 18:31.210
This is more a construct of a mall.
You know, like in The Matrix.

18:32.250 --> 18:34.420
- You saw The Matrix?
- Love that flick.

18:34.650 --> 18:37.559
When Trinity's all, "Dodge this,"
and the agent....

18:38.250 --> 18:41.799
And I'm not really instilling
any awe anymore, am I?

18:42.450 --> 18:43.960
Why did you bring me here?

18:44.250 --> 18:47.160
To give you a choice.
But we'll get to that later.

18:47.849 --> 18:50.690
There's something I want you to see.

18:54.450 --> 18:56.059
Oh, my God.

18:57.450 --> 18:58.890
Doyle.

19:03.450 --> 19:05.910
That's what happened.
Big, cosmic whoops.

19:06.450 --> 19:08.660
Doyle wasn't meant
to give you visions.

19:08.849 --> 19:13.059
- Then why did The Powers let him?
- They usually catch that sort of thing.

19:14.250 --> 19:17.660
What they didn't count on
were his feelings for you.

19:18.450 --> 19:23.750
You mean, Doyle gave me the visions
because he loved me?

19:25.049 --> 19:28.630
I can't answer that.
I can tell you that it was a mistake.

19:31.049 --> 19:33.579
I thought The Powers That Be
knew everything.

19:34.049 --> 19:36.190
Life and death, they got a handle on.

19:36.450 --> 19:39.819
Who someone chooses to love,
well, that's just free will.

19:40.650 --> 19:44.269
You see, Cordelia, the visions
are an ancient powerful force.

19:44.849 --> 19:46.809
Only demons can withstand them.

19:47.250 --> 19:51.150
I've had them for more than two years.
Doesn't that mean I'm strong?

19:52.049 --> 19:55.950
Strong, yes. Demon, no.
Just ask Tammy here.

19:57.450 --> 19:59.910
- Tammy where?
- Hello, miss.

20:01.049 --> 20:04.490
This is Tammy.
She had the visions back in-- 163O?

20:04.650 --> 20:08.440
Aye. Had them well nigh on a year.
And a hellish year it was too.

20:09.450 --> 20:13.099
Town fathers called me a witch.
Wanted to burn me at the stake.

20:13.650 --> 20:18.150
- They killed you because you had visions?
- No, miss. They didn't have to.

20:19.650 --> 20:23.059
Last vision I had blew out
the back of me skull.

20:25.049 --> 20:27.299
Humans wasn't meant
to have the visions.

20:28.049 --> 20:31.349
If you want my advice,
you'll listen to our man Skip here.

20:31.650 --> 20:35.579
- He won't steer you wrong, this one.
- Oh, get out of here.

20:37.049 --> 20:40.210
Really. Get out. I've got work.

20:42.450 --> 20:43.920
You okay?

20:55.289 --> 20:56.410
Thanks, Lorne.

20:57.089 --> 21:01.799
It is come, The champion
has come, Come for what?

21:02.490 --> 21:06.109
Answers not to be had,
Death is certain,

21:06.690 --> 21:08.829
Death awaits,

21:09.690 --> 21:12.430
- I wanna talk to the Conduit.
- We are the Conduit,

21:12.690 --> 21:16.309
The gateway, the all-times, the ever,
It wishes to speak to us,

21:16.890 --> 21:19.140
Yes, it does.
You gonna show yourselves?

21:19.890 --> 21:23.259
We are unseen, formless,
It speaks unknowing, Send it away,

21:23.490 --> 21:27.420
I'm not going anywhere till I get my
message to The Powers That Be.

21:28.289 --> 21:32.750
My friend Cordelia has visions
given to her by The Powers.

21:34.890 --> 21:39.670
They're killing her. I want The Powers
to take them back.

21:41.490 --> 21:44.190
Let her go. She's suffered enough.

21:45.690 --> 21:46.920
Suffering,

21:48.089 --> 21:49.839
Does it know suffering?

21:51.690 --> 21:53.369
Yes, it does,

21:55.890 --> 21:59.720
The Powers owe nothing,
Send it away, Send it away,

22:00.690 --> 22:02.619
I'm not finished.

22:03.089 --> 22:06.000
Ever had the vague sensation
you left the oven on?

22:06.690 --> 22:10.200
Or that you were supposed to call
someone, you just forgot who?

22:10.890 --> 22:14.299
Have you ever felt that way
about your acting career?

22:14.490 --> 22:19.200
- I don't have an acting career.
- Which brings me to my next point.

22:22.289 --> 22:23.759
I remember that night.

22:24.690 --> 22:27.920
You'd been in L.A. a few months,
things were lean...

22:28.289 --> 22:30.079
...and who should you run into?

22:31.890 --> 22:35.259
Your life changed that night,
in ways you couldn't imagine.

22:36.089 --> 22:38.619
Indescribably painful ways,
you'll agree.

22:39.089 --> 22:42.500
Now, what if the play
ran a little different?

22:42.690 --> 22:46.059
You're on the sideline, here,
talking to wannabe moguls.

22:46.890 --> 22:51.490
Angel is downfield here. Instead of
cutting to the middle to meet him...

22:52.289 --> 22:54.569
...what if you'd been
forced to counter?

22:55.289 --> 22:58.059
What if this guy,
a very powerful talent agent...

22:58.289 --> 23:01.480
...flanks you and drew you offsides?
What would happen?

23:02.490 --> 23:06.140
- I'd score a touchdown?
- Metaphorically speaking, heck yeah.

23:07.890 --> 23:12.529
Inside every living thing there is
a connection to The Powers That Be.

23:13.289 --> 23:15.390
Call it instinct, intuition.

23:15.690 --> 23:18.529
Deep down, we all know
our purpose in this world.

23:19.289 --> 23:22.170
Are you saying I was meant
to be an actress?

23:22.890 --> 23:27.700
No. I'm saying you were meant to be an
incredibly famous and wealthy actress.

23:28.890 --> 23:32.960
- The Powers That Be can make it happen.
- They can turn back time?

23:33.690 --> 23:38.079
They don't go for that much.
Think of it as writing over history.

23:39.089 --> 23:41.690
You could live the life
you've always wanted.

23:42.089 --> 23:47.430
No monsters, no visions, no dying.
Well, not for a long time, anyway.

23:48.690 --> 23:50.619
But no Angel.

23:51.690 --> 23:54.039
Cordelia, I want you to listen to me.

23:54.690 --> 23:58.059
If you go back inside your body,
you won't wake up.

23:58.890 --> 24:02.720
You will lie there, unable to move,
unable to speak...

24:03.089 --> 24:06.279
...until the next vision hits you
and then you will die.

24:07.289 --> 24:09.359
But that's not fair.

24:10.289 --> 24:14.359
How will Angel know to save that
girl if I don't tell him where she is?

24:15.089 --> 24:16.740
He needs me.

24:20.490 --> 24:22.349
Let's go in here.

24:25.289 --> 24:29.190
Its pleas are pointless, Her
path is chosen, We will not interfere,

24:30.089 --> 24:33.039
She's not strong enough
to handle the visions.

24:33.690 --> 24:37.589
- It speaks and does not listen,
- No, you're not listening!

24:38.490 --> 24:43.089
Cordelia's not a champion. She's a
rich girl who likes to play superhero.

24:43.890 --> 24:48.630
She doesn't have what it takes
to do this. Don't The Powers get that?

24:49.890 --> 24:53.579
Stop whispering and listen to me,
damn it! She's weak.

24:54.089 --> 24:56.900
Skip, get me out of here, now.

24:58.890 --> 25:00.609
You're killing her.

25:01.890 --> 25:06.559
She's unconscious, and she's alone.
Who knows if she's in pain?

25:07.289 --> 25:10.170
It is angry, It is afraid,

25:13.289 --> 25:16.170
I'm more afraid of her dying
than she is.

25:18.089 --> 25:19.559
What is that?

25:21.690 --> 25:24.150
Cordelia, are you sure?

25:24.690 --> 25:27.180
You gave me a choice,
so I'm choosing.

25:27.690 --> 25:31.519
Okay, kid, here goes.
I'm gonna make you a star.

25:35.490 --> 25:37.349
And now, ladies and gentlemen,,,

25:37.890 --> 25:40.589
... the two-time Emmy-winning
star of our show...

25:40.890 --> 25:45.529
... the gal with the million-dollar
smile, Cordelia Chase!

26:02.049 --> 26:03.240
One, two, three, four.

26:39.849 --> 26:41.390
- Great show, Cordy.
- Thanks.

26:41.650 --> 26:44.069
There are stars and there are stars,
then there is you.

26:44.650 --> 26:46.720
Am I paying you enough?

26:47.049 --> 26:48.730
- Well--
- Good. What's cooking?

26:49.450 --> 26:53.000
You got a costume fitting.
Producers want to run ideas by you.

26:53.650 --> 26:55.230
Hi. What's your name?

26:55.450 --> 26:58.400
We wanna record that breast
cancer PSA next week.

26:59.049 --> 27:02.069
No, make it tomorrow.
Do you ever get that feeling...

27:02.650 --> 27:05.980
...you should be doing something,
but you can't remember what?

27:06.250 --> 27:08.599
No. I'm organized.
That's why you pay me well.

27:09.250 --> 27:12.480
- But with the holidays coming--
- I have to go, I'm sorry.

27:12.849 --> 27:16.609
I want something.
Hypo-something.... Hypothermia....

27:17.650 --> 27:20.069
Get ice water in Miss Chase's
dressing room.

27:20.650 --> 27:22.049
- That's not it.
- Canceling.

27:22.450 --> 27:25.680
- Hyper.... Hyperbaric?
- Josh, make it an oxygen tent.

27:26.049 --> 27:27.349
- That's not it.
- Canceling.

27:27.849 --> 27:29.529
- Hyperion! That's it.
- The hotel.

27:29.650 --> 27:32.839
- I want to go there.
- Terrific. When would--? Now?

27:33.849 --> 27:35.460
Without an entourage of me?

27:35.650 --> 27:38.039
I'll call them.
Josh, car, side door, now.

28:03.210 --> 28:06.160
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Yes? Can we help--?

28:06.809 --> 28:11.339
Oh, Miss Chase. How can you help me?
How can I help--? Wait.

28:12.210 --> 28:13.470
How can we help you?

28:14.009 --> 28:17.130
I believe my assistant
made a reservation.

28:17.609 --> 28:19.930
Ah, the luxury suite.

28:20.609 --> 28:23.279
I will take you right up to my room.

28:24.210 --> 28:26.559
Your room, I meant.

28:27.210 --> 28:29.880
Welcome to the Hyperion.

28:33.809 --> 28:36.130
Here we are, Miss Chase.

28:36.210 --> 28:38.950
The luxury suite.

28:42.809 --> 28:44.109
No.

28:47.009 --> 28:48.410
This one.

28:50.009 --> 28:51.450
I want this one.

28:51.809 --> 28:55.359
But that's a....
That's a standard, Miss Chase.

28:56.009 --> 28:58.680
- Hardly fitting for someone of your--
- Open it.

28:59.609 --> 29:01.190
Yes, certainly.

29:33.210 --> 29:35.740
- This wallpaper...?
- Ah, yes.

29:36.809 --> 29:40.849
Designed by renowned artist
Jacques Latour.

29:43.410 --> 29:46.390
Remodeling-- Yes, uh....

29:53.009 --> 29:57.400
I hate that wallpaper.
That's bad, bad wallpaper.

30:01.410 --> 30:03.480
171 Oak.

30:05.009 --> 30:06.660
Where is that?

30:16.730 --> 30:19.220
Oh, hi.
I'm really sorry to bother you--

30:19.730 --> 30:23.140
Oh, my God.
You're Cordelia Chase.

30:23.930 --> 30:27.440
- Oh....
- You're.... Cordy.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.250
Yeah, hi.

30:29.930 --> 30:34.140
Listen, I know you don't know me,
but would you mind if I...?

30:34.730 --> 30:38.589
- Oh, please, come in.
- Okay, thanks.

30:43.730 --> 30:46.710
I'm Cynthia. Cynthia York.

30:47.329 --> 30:52.140
And I love your show.
Like, love-love.

30:53.329 --> 30:55.930
You are just-- You are my idol, Cordy.

30:56.329 --> 31:00.049
I want to be just like you,
and have my own design firm, and--

31:01.130 --> 31:04.680
Wait a second.
What are you doing in Reseda?

31:05.329 --> 31:09.259
Yeah. Good question.

31:10.730 --> 31:16.460
This is gonna sound a little bizarre,
but is everything okay here?

31:17.329 --> 31:20.769
Nothing bad's happened, has it?

31:22.130 --> 31:27.190
- My dad left us a couple months ago.
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

31:28.130 --> 31:29.779
Is your mom here?

31:32.329 --> 31:35.240
- She's up in Ojai, visiting friends.
- Oh.

31:39.529 --> 31:40.609
That's....

31:40.730 --> 31:42.339
Well, okay, then.

31:42.529 --> 31:43.579
Hey.

31:44.930 --> 31:47.210
You wanna see something cool?

31:48.529 --> 31:49.759
Sure.

31:56.329 --> 31:58.500
It's a retrieval spell.

31:58.730 --> 32:02.240
I'm gonna make my dad come back
and live with us again.

32:02.930 --> 32:05.250
I'm pretty sure
I did everything right...

32:05.930 --> 32:10.849
...though I spilled Diet Coke on the
book I was using and had to improvise.

32:12.529 --> 32:14.109
Pretty cool pentagram, huh?

32:14.329 --> 32:16.009
Cynthia?

32:16.130 --> 32:18.730
I think we should
get out of here before--

32:22.730 --> 32:24.869
- That happens.
- Oh, my God!

32:29.930 --> 32:32.390
Go, Cynthia!
Go on, get out of here. Go!

32:44.930 --> 32:46.329
- Get the girl.
- Let's go.

32:46.730 --> 32:47.710
Outside.

32:49.730 --> 32:52.539
What are you doing here,
and what happened to your arm?

32:53.329 --> 32:54.589
Look out.

33:13.130 --> 33:15.869
So you, like, kill things now.

33:16.130 --> 33:19.750
Last time I saw you, you just
kind of fainted in front of them.

33:20.329 --> 33:22.359
Cordelia, why on earth are you here?

33:22.730 --> 33:25.569
I know, Reseda.
It's the ninth circle of hell--

33:26.329 --> 33:29.630
Not Reseda. In this house.
Is that girl a friend of yours?

33:30.529 --> 33:34.109
Look, I know we haven't seen
each other in a while.

33:34.730 --> 33:37.819
But there is something weird
going on with me.

33:38.329 --> 33:39.559
Like, Sunnydale weird.

33:41.329 --> 33:43.359
Oh, my God.

33:44.329 --> 33:46.259
My mom is gonna freak.

33:52.130 --> 33:55.680
And underneath
the wallpaper was this address.

33:56.329 --> 33:59.740
So for absolutely no sane-person
reason I can think of...

34:00.529 --> 34:03.970
...I come out here, and whammo,
slimy-monster-fun time.

34:04.730 --> 34:06.730
- What's up with that?
- I'm not sure.

34:07.130 --> 34:10.889
- I'll have to consult my books.
- Some things never change.

34:13.130 --> 34:16.389
Oh, sorry.
This is my partner, Charles Gunn.

34:16.730 --> 34:18.800
Wes said he knew you,
but I didn't believe him.

34:19.730 --> 34:22.190
Yeah, we go way back.

34:22.730 --> 34:26.730
Back to when you had two arms.
Which, by the way....

34:26.929 --> 34:30.510
- Kungai demon, couple years ago.
- Is it true you and Wes--?

34:31.730 --> 34:32.989
That you had a little--

34:32.929 --> 34:36.829
Humiliating kiss where he drooled
all over my chin?

34:38.329 --> 34:41.070
Yeah. But I've worked really hard
to repress it.

34:41.329 --> 34:44.590
As much as I enjoy this death march
down memory lane....

34:45.530 --> 34:47.780
What's with you Sunnydale
folks and repression?

34:47.929 --> 34:50.320
You three are the most
denying-est folks.

34:50.929 --> 34:52.159
Three?

34:53.329 --> 34:55.500
Who else is here in L.A.?

34:58.570 --> 35:01.269
Cordelia, I want you
to think about this.

35:02.170 --> 35:04.800
Angel's not the person you knew.

35:06.369 --> 35:09.559
He came to Los Angeles in pain,
vulnerable.

35:09.969 --> 35:14.469
And when Doyle, his only friend, died,
he retreated into himself.

35:15.369 --> 35:18.139
Him getting the visions
didn't help either.

35:20.170 --> 35:21.920
So let me get this straight.

35:21.969 --> 35:25.480
Angel gets the visions
of people who are gonna die...

35:26.170 --> 35:28.380
...he tells you,
you go out and slay...

35:29.170 --> 35:31.590
...and this is how
you make your living?

35:31.570 --> 35:34.340
This has gotta be the suckiest
job in the world.

35:35.170 --> 35:37.980
Pays the bills. Occasionally.

35:38.769 --> 35:41.679
Don't be shocked by his condition.

35:42.369 --> 35:45.809
The visions have taken a toll.
And the isolation.

35:47.170 --> 35:51.909
Sometimes he sends us out to save
people he killed 200 years ago.

35:55.570 --> 35:59.150
- Why not just tell him you said hi?
- Wesley...

36:00.969 --> 36:02.690
...I've gotta see him.

36:15.369 --> 36:18.849
Restraints. Sometimes the visions
make him violent.

36:19.570 --> 36:22.409
171 Oak.... 171 Oak Drive.

36:22.570 --> 36:26.360
Do you hear me? I feel better.
I can be alone. I won't run away.

36:27.369 --> 36:30.280
- Oh, my God.
- This is one of his good days.

36:30.969 --> 36:32.900
No, I won't. I won't do that.

36:33.369 --> 36:35.719
I didn't mean--
Only if it's dead.

36:36.369 --> 36:38.650
It was me. It was my fault. I'm okay.

36:38.769 --> 36:41.650
- I didn't mean, I didn't mean....
- Don't get too close.

36:42.969 --> 36:45.000
- I won't run away.
- Angel.

36:51.969 --> 36:55.199
Do you remember me?
Cordelia?

36:55.570 --> 36:57.639
No. I'm afraid.

36:58.570 --> 37:00.780
I'm afraid, I'm afraid.

37:01.570 --> 37:06.909
Shh.... Don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you.

37:08.170 --> 37:10.309
I'm fine. I'm fine.

37:10.570 --> 37:12.360
171. 171. You'll see.

37:12.969 --> 37:14.409
My head doesn't hurt.

37:15.369 --> 37:17.579
My head doesn't hurt now anymore....

37:17.769 --> 37:21.000
- You don't remember me.
- I was there, and I wanted to die.

37:21.969 --> 37:25.130
But I was afraid to die.
I was afraid to die.

37:25.570 --> 37:28.829
171. 171. 171.

37:32.769 --> 37:33.639
- 171.
- Shh....

37:33.969 --> 37:37.590
Angel, it's okay.
Everything is gonna be okay.

37:38.170 --> 37:42.420
- There was nothing I could do.
- Everything's gonna be okay.

37:59.769 --> 38:02.019
I remember everything.

38:03.369 --> 38:04.880
The visions...

38:06.369 --> 38:09.039
- ...they're mine.
- We made a deal.

38:09.369 --> 38:12.949
You gave up the visions,
and the death that goes with them...

38:13.570 --> 38:16.940
...and you get to live out your dream.
It was a fair trade.

38:17.769 --> 38:21.559
Sure, it's fair. But it wasn't me.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.699
We've been over this.

38:26.170 --> 38:28.170
I respect what you're trying to do.

38:28.570 --> 38:31.480
It's noble and heroic,
and all that Gladiator crap.

38:32.170 --> 38:33.329
- You saw--?
- Didn't love it.

38:33.969 --> 38:37.519
Humans are not strong enough
to harbor the visions, period.

38:38.170 --> 38:42.170
- Even The Powers can't change that.
- Then find a loophole, Skip.

38:42.969 --> 38:46.480
I know my purpose in this world,
and it includes the visions.

38:47.170 --> 38:51.809
And if The Powers That Be aren't
complete dumb-asses, they know it too.

38:54.369 --> 38:57.070
There may be a tiny loophole.

38:57.969 --> 39:00.849
- I'll take it.
- You may want to think about that.

39:00.969 --> 39:05.010
The only way you get to keep the
visions is by becoming part demon.

39:08.170 --> 39:12.070
The process isn't easy. It'll make your
vision pain feel like Candyland.

39:12.969 --> 39:17.320
After the agony, the transformation's
effects would be unpredictable.

39:17.769 --> 39:21.670
You may never be able to lead
a human life again.

39:27.969 --> 39:30.739
So? Demonize me, already.

39:33.369 --> 39:36.739
It was an honor being your guide,
Cordelia Chase.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.909
What's happening to her?

39:52.050 --> 39:53.940
- I thought I lost you.
- Oh, Angel.

39:59.250 --> 40:00.719
No horns.

40:01.650 --> 40:03.019
No tail.

40:04.650 --> 40:06.860
Just checking.

40:08.849 --> 40:12.679
It feels so good to be solid again.

40:16.050 --> 40:19.630
- What's the last thing you remember?
- When? I've been so--

40:24.449 --> 40:28.000
You mean the vision downstairs.
It's been taken care of.

40:28.650 --> 40:31.949
There was this actress,
and a one-armed guy....

40:32.250 --> 40:35.659
It's a long story, but right now
we have to solve my vision.

40:36.449 --> 40:39.570
- The one you said was taken care of?
- The one I'm having.

40:40.050 --> 40:44.829
There's a young man in a park in
Glendale, somewhere near a pond.

40:46.050 --> 40:48.750
There's a demon waiting for him,
he's red...

40:49.050 --> 40:52.460
...with four-- No, make it five horns.

40:53.849 --> 40:56.969
- Uh.... Cordy?
- What?
