01:05.942 --> 01:07.692
One of my favourite presentations.

01:07.861 --> 01:09.901
Will you excuse me one second?

01:20.540 --> 01:23.840
...floating oil, submerged oil...

01:24.002 --> 01:26.132
...contaminated soils...

01:26.296 --> 01:28.206
...shifting submerged oil...

01:28.381 --> 01:31.301
...and recovery of
additional environments.

01:33.011 --> 01:35.051
Just the physical damage alone.

01:35.221 --> 01:37.681
A pregnancy is brutal on your body.

01:37.849 --> 01:39.929
There's also a risk
from the hormonal changes:

01:40.101 --> 01:42.691
Mood disorders, depression.

01:43.146 --> 01:45.856
Are you sure you still
wanna be a surrogate?

01:46.024 --> 01:47.484
Yes. I am.

01:48.151 --> 01:51.951
If more than two embryos take,
the couple may choose to abort some.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.243
Well, that's their choice.

01:54.407 --> 01:57.037
Now, he's gonna keep pushing her here.
It's deliberate.

01:57.202 --> 02:00.292
The girls always think they've made
their decision to be a surrogate...

02:00.455 --> 02:03.535
...but a lot of them change their mind
after about an hour with Carl.

02:03.708 --> 02:05.248
Hey, John.

02:05.752 --> 02:07.712
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.260
It's fine, I'm here.

02:11.424 --> 02:13.054
I'm here.

02:13.635 --> 02:14.965
- So we found someone?
- Yeah...

02:15.136 --> 02:16.846
...possibly. Anna Walsh.

02:17.013 --> 02:20.273
She's 21. She lives here in the city,
she's a waitress.

02:20.433 --> 02:24.153
And she is brand-new.
Just walked in today.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.652
- What would your choice be?
- If the children were mine?

02:27.816 --> 02:29.146
Oh, come on, Anna.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.777
Aren't they? In a way?

02:31.986 --> 02:34.236
Life can take an unexpected turn.

02:34.405 --> 02:35.865
You could lose the baby.

02:36.032 --> 02:39.082
If life worked out the way it was
supposed to, I wouldn't be here.

02:40.286 --> 02:43.326
Anna, why are you really doing this?

02:43.498 --> 02:46.838
Because I have the opportunity
to help someone who can't have a child.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.465
Look at her eyes.

02:52.632 --> 02:54.382
She means it.

02:54.551 --> 02:56.891
I don't like your interview guy.
He is a bully.

02:57.053 --> 02:59.933
But I do like her.

03:01.641 --> 03:02.771
I like her.

03:07.063 --> 03:08.113
Okay.

03:11.734 --> 03:13.074
If we submit...

03:16.155 --> 03:17.655
Martin.

03:18.992 --> 03:21.452
- Todd.
- Is Grafton gonna settle?

03:21.619 --> 03:23.539
Oh, they're gonna wish they did.

03:23.705 --> 03:25.825
I want you to bring Todd up to speed.

03:25.999 --> 03:29.379
If we go to court on this,
it'll be the firm sticking its neck out.

03:29.544 --> 03:33.094
Now, this is still your baby,
but I want a second pair of eyes.

03:33.965 --> 03:35.925
Right. Of course.

03:36.092 --> 03:37.472
No problem.

03:43.558 --> 03:44.978
Hey, babe.

03:45.143 --> 03:46.733
Cooper was just in here.

03:46.895 --> 03:48.975
He's putting Todd frigging Decker
on my case.

03:49.147 --> 03:52.067
- I'm with her.
- You're with who?

03:52.233 --> 03:53.823
Anna.

03:55.236 --> 03:58.446
It took forever to fill out the paperwork,
and I was starved...

03:58.615 --> 04:02.075
...so I dropped into that little diner
where she works and she was here...

04:02.243 --> 04:04.253
...waiting for her fiancé to pick her up.

04:04.913 --> 04:07.173
She's great.

04:11.586 --> 04:13.416
I know, I know, I know.

04:13.588 --> 04:15.588
There are a million things
that can go wrong...

04:15.757 --> 04:18.297
...and we still have to do
the health checks and just everything.

04:18.468 --> 04:20.088
Exactly. It's...

04:20.261 --> 04:24.311
I just don't want us to spend
another two years looking...

04:24.474 --> 04:26.894
...and maybe missing,
and the whole time, she was the one.

04:30.188 --> 04:32.398
She's so shy.

04:34.692 --> 04:37.112
But there's something else there, like...

04:37.278 --> 04:40.158
...I know she can take care of herself.

04:40.365 --> 04:44.035
I invited her and her fiancé Michael
over for dinner tomorrow night.

04:44.202 --> 04:46.252
- Oh, babe.
- Is it okay?

04:47.455 --> 04:49.575
Well, I'll tell you,
when you move, you move.

04:49.791 --> 04:52.091
I'm sorry, but I just wanna do it right.

04:52.251 --> 04:55.211
I really want them to like us.

05:27.662 --> 05:31.212
I'm sorry if I overdid this.
We could've just gone out.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.292
No, are you kidding?

05:33.459 --> 05:35.339
This... This is real nice.

05:35.545 --> 05:38.125
It's what I do, actually. I'm a chef.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.140
I know it's just a meal...

05:43.302 --> 05:46.312
...but I meant it to show you both
how committed we are.

05:47.306 --> 05:48.926
The baby is your business.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.100
- One hundred percent.
- But you will be carrying it.

05:51.310 --> 05:54.980
In the service, I know a lot of guys
who've done this before.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.689
When you're deployed, it just makes sense.

05:57.859 --> 06:01.449
When I'm gone, you two, you know,
you come see her whenever you want.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.822
I understand you'll be using the money
to buy a business.

06:04.115 --> 06:07.785
Oh, from my uncle.
Residential and commercial roofing.

06:07.994 --> 06:10.504
He had quite the run here after Katrina.

06:10.663 --> 06:13.463
Owning the company means you get
a piece of everybody's take-home.

06:13.666 --> 06:17.586
Plus markup, overhead.

06:17.754 --> 06:20.264
Mike's always been real smart about money.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.723
With my deployment bonus...

06:22.675 --> 06:27.305
...we'll be able to put together
almost $40,000.

06:27.472 --> 06:29.102
And that's enough to buy the whole thing.

06:30.183 --> 06:34.983
Anna, I'm sure there are probably
some questions that you have for us?

06:37.356 --> 06:38.976
Can I smoke somewhere?

06:42.820 --> 06:44.990
Nice home you got here.

06:46.491 --> 06:49.791
These renovations must have
cost you a pretty penny.

06:49.952 --> 06:53.712
Well, the house was part of Laura's
inheritance from her grandmother.

06:53.873 --> 06:56.383
The renovations, they came later.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.960
Must be nice to lay out that kind of cash.

07:06.469 --> 07:10.849
Working by windows, you see a lot
of things that nobody else would see.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.441
Weird shit, you know?

07:14.894 --> 07:16.354
Housewives, whatever.

07:16.521 --> 07:18.821
Act like they're alone...

07:18.981 --> 07:20.651
...but they know we're there.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.203
Right.

07:24.529 --> 07:26.659
Benefit of the job, right?

07:35.123 --> 07:38.383
That, there, isn't the right material.

07:39.085 --> 07:40.745
That gutter's leaking at the splice.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.465
Gonna mess up that window.

07:45.091 --> 07:46.841
Yeah?

07:48.344 --> 07:51.764
Look, if we do this...

07:51.931 --> 07:54.641
...we just wanna make sure that
you and Anna are comfortable with it.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.766
We are. Of course.

07:58.354 --> 08:00.864
See, it's just that we're down
to our last viable embryo, right?

08:01.023 --> 08:04.613
And we wanna make sure that you know
how serious our intentions are.

08:04.986 --> 08:06.816
I get it.

08:06.988 --> 08:08.528
Right?

08:09.157 --> 08:11.277
One hundred percent.

08:12.785 --> 08:16.035
We tried for a long time to get pregnant.

08:16.873 --> 08:20.633
I had three miscarriages.

08:23.588 --> 08:25.508
It really put the two of us through hell.

08:28.176 --> 08:30.756
You actually start to hate...

08:30.928 --> 08:32.428
...your own body.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.650
I've never had anything...

08:44.817 --> 08:47.817
...that anybody wanted before.

08:48.446 --> 08:51.116
Except for the obvious.

08:52.491 --> 08:56.081
I've never been able
to give anybody anything.

09:02.001 --> 09:04.961
Okay, just spill it, Taylor,
you didn't like them.

09:05.129 --> 09:07.129
Okay, him. I mean, we go outside, right?

09:07.298 --> 09:10.428
And he's talking to me about...

09:10.593 --> 09:13.223
...looking at housewives
undressing through windows.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.887
Maybe that's his way of bonding.

09:16.682 --> 09:20.442
I don't know, babe.
I mean, we can keep looking.

09:20.645 --> 09:23.975
I think doing something like this
is really important to her.

09:24.148 --> 09:26.778
Yeah, I know, it's kind of cute.
I mean, you see...

09:26.943 --> 09:29.113
...the way she left a price tag
on the dress?

09:29.278 --> 09:30.818
She's taking it back tomorrow.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.988
She wanted to wear something nice
to impress us.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.408
I did that on our first date.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.367
Oh, yeah, I remember that dress.

09:39.580 --> 09:43.790
Matter of fact, I remember undoing it,
like this.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.210
Did I let you?

09:46.379 --> 09:48.589
On the first date?

09:48.798 --> 09:50.168
I was bad.

09:50.341 --> 09:54.761
You were so bad
that you were, oh, so good.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.018
John.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.855
I want to.

10:05.815 --> 10:09.145
Having them here...

10:09.485 --> 10:12.145
...it just brings it all back.

10:13.823 --> 10:16.373
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.615
It's okay. It's okay, babe.

10:18.786 --> 10:19.906
It's all right.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.627
We're gonna do this, aren't we?

10:32.633 --> 10:35.013
She's the one.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.666
Ready?

11:10.504 --> 11:11.924
All right, hold still.

11:13.049 --> 11:14.929
It's gonna feel like a little stick.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.800
All right. Don't move.

11:34.987 --> 11:38.277
I'm placing the embryo. Don't move.

11:38.908 --> 11:40.238
You're doing good.

11:49.835 --> 11:52.165
And there.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.342
All right. Here we go.

11:57.802 --> 11:59.262
- I'll take that.
- Thank you.

11:59.428 --> 12:02.098
All right, we're done. You did great.

12:04.475 --> 12:06.305
Thank you.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.559
Good job.

12:12.983 --> 12:16.033
People always talk about
how they know the moment...

12:16.195 --> 12:18.195
...when their child was conceived.

12:18.364 --> 12:21.414
A wedding night or a special date.

12:22.410 --> 12:24.040
But I will know for sure...

12:25.121 --> 12:26.371
...it was this moment.

12:56.610 --> 12:59.700
The baby could be starting
its life right now.

13:01.866 --> 13:03.616
It's strange.

13:03.993 --> 13:07.833
It just keeps hitting me
how strange it is.

13:08.038 --> 13:11.378
I mean, it's against the law
to pay someone to have sex...

13:11.584 --> 13:14.004
...but you can pay a woman to get
pregnant with your child?

13:14.170 --> 13:17.260
- Imagine how it is for the boyfriend.
- She said she loves him.

13:17.465 --> 13:19.295
She doesn't hesitate,
doesn't question it...

13:19.467 --> 13:21.547
...she just loves him.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.639
She asked if it was the same with us.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.137
But it wasn't, was it?

13:27.933 --> 13:30.023
We worked hard.

13:31.437 --> 13:33.727
And we hung in there.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.356
But it was worth it.

13:35.941 --> 13:37.361
Yeah, it was.

13:40.362 --> 13:43.372
When I was working on this room...

13:44.575 --> 13:47.075
...sometimes I would just...

13:47.995 --> 13:50.155
...close my eyes
and imagine you in here...

13:50.331 --> 13:51.541
...playing with our baby.

13:51.957 --> 13:54.077
It's gonna work this time.

13:54.293 --> 13:55.633
Hey.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.955
We're gonna have a family.

14:20.736 --> 14:25.406
We need to do more research
on that section of pollution, 11.62.

14:25.574 --> 14:27.704
Once we have that going on...

14:27.868 --> 14:30.368
- You guys go ahead. I gotta take this.
- All right, John.

14:30.538 --> 14:32.668
- Hey, babe. Just got out of court.
- John.

14:32.831 --> 14:35.381
John, you're gonna be a father.

14:35.543 --> 14:36.593
What?

14:36.752 --> 14:37.752
Anna's here and...

14:38.587 --> 14:41.127
She took a home test.
She took three of them...

14:41.298 --> 14:42.878
...and all three of them were positive.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.970
Oh, my God. I'm gonna be a father.

14:46.178 --> 14:49.678
Anna's sitting here watching me
bawl my eyes out.

14:50.641 --> 14:53.311
- Babe.
- Yeah.

15:01.277 --> 15:03.777
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey, Daddy.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.736
- I want her to go to Yale.
- No, no. He is gonna go to LSU.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.287
- Law review.
- First female president.

15:09.451 --> 15:11.291
Okay.

15:11.453 --> 15:14.253
Anna's in the shower. She's gonna
come say hi when she's done.

15:14.415 --> 15:17.125
- Okay. You guys going to yoga together?
- Yep.

15:19.461 --> 15:22.051
I didn't know how I'd feel
about somebody else's body...

15:22.214 --> 15:25.224
...going through everything
but I really like this girl.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.433
I really like you.

15:27.595 --> 15:29.845
- I really like you.
- I really love you.

15:33.851 --> 15:35.851
I didn't know he was here.

15:36.020 --> 15:39.230
- He came home early.
- No, Anna, this is... Oh, it's...

15:39.481 --> 15:41.941
This is great news.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.899
It's great news.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.610
This is good work, John.

16:28.781 --> 16:30.821
If this is right, they got nowhere to run.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.081
Well, unless they draw
Judge Steve Paulson.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.203
He doesn't believe in
corporate negligence.

16:35.371 --> 16:38.001
Invite him to your charity event
next month.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.825
The man loves cocktail shrimp
and the Saints.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.631
Done.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.683
Will you guys just excuse me for a minute?

16:53.305 --> 16:54.345
She's here for you?

16:55.516 --> 16:56.976
She's a relative.

17:00.104 --> 17:01.364
I called Laura.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.232
She told me to come. I'm sorry.

17:03.399 --> 17:05.479
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

17:05.651 --> 17:09.031
I had a doctor's appointment.
Mike didn't pick me up.

17:10.239 --> 17:11.909
Okay, let's go.

17:21.709 --> 17:22.919
Come on, honey.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.244
I grew up in a neighbourhood
just like this.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.627
My father, he worked so hard,
he didn't have that many days off...

17:27.798 --> 17:30.218
...but when he did...

17:30.426 --> 17:32.676
...he used to pick me up from school.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.063
God, I can't wait to do that.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.772
You're welcome, John.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.050
- So you okay?
- Yeah. Thanks for the ride.

18:17.973 --> 18:20.353
Quiet. Quiet!

18:26.940 --> 18:29.150
Guess you forgot to pick her up.

18:29.568 --> 18:30.608
Everything good?

18:33.113 --> 18:34.493
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.082
I'm great.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.200
How's this one working out?

18:42.414 --> 18:44.294
Anything you need me to talk to her about?

18:46.043 --> 18:47.133
Everything's fine.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.457
Go in the house right now.

18:50.631 --> 18:51.971
Now.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.020
Let's go.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.655
It's been a long day, cat.

19:21.829 --> 19:22.829
Move.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.827
Mess with me?

19:27.042 --> 19:29.672
That's what I'm talking about.

19:36.844 --> 19:38.934
What's troubling that
pretty little head of yours?

19:39.429 --> 19:41.349
Anna said she'd call me, and she hasn't.

19:42.099 --> 19:44.019
She's young. She probably just forgot.

19:47.729 --> 19:48.769
Told you.

19:50.983 --> 19:52.693
Hello?

19:54.611 --> 19:56.241
What?

20:12.045 --> 20:13.335
- You must be John Taylor?
- Yes.

20:13.505 --> 20:14.545
Right over here.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.972
I'm fine.

20:22.139 --> 20:23.719
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

20:23.932 --> 20:27.272
- The baby's okay?
- Baby's fine. I'm sure.

20:27.769 --> 20:30.189
The perpetrator,
Mr. Mitchell, he'll be taken in...

20:30.355 --> 20:33.275
...and charged with domestic battery.
He acknowledged striking Miss Walsh.

20:33.442 --> 20:36.612
- You're not gonna let him out, are you?
- He makes bail, we can't hold him.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.950
- But he'll hurt me.
- He tries to harm you...

20:39.114 --> 20:41.414
...you call us, we'll arrest him again.

20:41.575 --> 20:44.115
You may wanna try to find
another place to stay.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.366
I don't have another place to stay.

20:46.538 --> 20:47.748
Yes, you do.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.893
He hurt my face.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.774
I am so sorry.

21:16.652 --> 21:18.282
- It's okay.
- I am so sorry.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.525
- No, it's okay.
- Anna!

21:22.574 --> 21:23.784
- Anna!
- Hey.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.544
- Anna!
- Let's go!

21:25.702 --> 21:27.042
- Anna!
- Don't move!

21:27.204 --> 21:29.874
- Hey, hey!
- Get down. Get down!

21:32.084 --> 21:34.094
I got him. All right. Get him in the car.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.880
- Come on. Come on! Get in the car!
- Anna.

21:51.853 --> 21:53.863
Oh, my God.

21:54.022 --> 21:57.732
You're okay, all right?
We're gonna take care of you.

21:58.610 --> 22:01.320
You're gonna be fine.
Let's get you inside.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.070
Hey, John.

22:44.448 --> 22:45.568
How the hell are you?

22:46.825 --> 22:48.155
I need you to listen to me, Mike.

22:49.202 --> 22:52.462
I need you to really understand
what I'm about to say.

22:54.249 --> 22:56.629
This is a restraining order.

22:57.753 --> 22:59.423
It's already happened.

22:59.588 --> 23:03.048
This is a case for domestic abuse...

23:03.216 --> 23:06.256
...battery and child endangerment.

23:06.470 --> 23:07.800
This is a letter to the DA...

23:08.013 --> 23:09.513
...who's a friend of mine...

23:09.681 --> 23:12.811
...recommending no less
than seven criminal counts.

23:13.643 --> 23:16.693
These haven't been filed yet.

23:18.106 --> 23:21.066
So, what's gonna happen now is this:

23:21.234 --> 23:22.654
You're gonna stay away from Anna.

23:23.570 --> 23:27.320
We're never gonna see you again.
She's never gonna see you again.

23:27.491 --> 23:29.831
In 10 days, you're gonna be shipped off
to the Middle East.

23:29.993 --> 23:33.083
And when you return,
your money's gonna be waiting for you.

23:36.666 --> 23:38.496
But if you ever...

23:38.668 --> 23:39.958
...come near Anna again...

23:41.838 --> 23:44.378
...I'm gonna bust your head open.

23:44.549 --> 23:46.889
Then I'm gonna make sure
your punk ass is sent somewhere...

23:47.052 --> 23:49.352
...that's gonna make the Middle East
look like Club Med.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.193
Have I made myself clear?

23:58.396 --> 24:00.016
Oh, yeah.

24:00.565 --> 24:03.025
- Crystal.
- Good.

24:03.527 --> 24:05.317
Opening 3.

24:06.655 --> 24:07.775
Have a nice life.

24:11.326 --> 24:13.116
Counsellor.

24:17.874 --> 24:20.044
Thanks for the visit.

24:47.612 --> 24:49.412
How is she?

24:50.198 --> 24:52.868
She's sleeping in the guest house.

24:53.994 --> 24:57.374
- Where'd you go?
- I just went to...

24:57.539 --> 25:00.249
...make sure Mike wouldn't be
a problem anymore.

25:03.837 --> 25:06.457
I was watching her sleep.

25:07.007 --> 25:09.257
She looks so pretty.

25:12.345 --> 25:15.465
John, it's okay. You can admit it.
She's beautiful.

25:15.640 --> 25:19.600
Yeah, well, I don't know.

25:20.103 --> 25:23.863
I guess if you're the type of guy...

25:25.066 --> 25:27.106
...who likes...

25:27.319 --> 25:29.989
...soft, young...

25:31.698 --> 25:33.908
...pert breasts.

25:36.620 --> 25:39.660
An ass that you can bounce
a quarter off of.

25:40.123 --> 25:42.633
But I hadn't really noticed,
I have to tell you.

25:44.169 --> 25:48.129
Oh, sometimes I forget
how good of a liar you are.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.625
I love you.

25:54.512 --> 25:56.892
I love you so much.

26:01.394 --> 26:03.404
You know that, right?

27:25.103 --> 27:28.113
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

27:32.986 --> 27:35.696
- Good morning, hon.
- Good morning.

27:37.532 --> 27:39.162
Thank you.

27:39.951 --> 27:43.251
Anna, we'd like you to stay here
with us in our guest house.

27:43.955 --> 27:46.365
We'd like you to take time off of work.

27:46.541 --> 27:48.041
We'll pay you whatever you were making.

27:48.209 --> 27:51.669
We'll get you a car so you don't feel
trapped. Come and go as you please.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.128
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

27:53.298 --> 27:55.508
We talked about it.
We feel more comfortable...

27:55.675 --> 27:58.845
- ...knowing you're here most of the time.
- And knowing that you're safe.

27:59.012 --> 28:01.102
It's just... I think Mike...

28:01.264 --> 28:03.984
Anna, Mike hurt you.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.191
And he's not gonna be around anymore.

28:07.354 --> 28:09.444
Not for a very long time.

28:09.647 --> 28:13.317
Now, you are doing
this incredible thing for us.

28:13.485 --> 28:15.695
It's the least we can do.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.656
Let us do something nice for you, okay?

28:21.868 --> 28:23.998
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:25.955 --> 28:27.955
Thank you.

28:57.821 --> 29:01.951
Well, she is now officially
better than me in yoga.

29:02.117 --> 29:04.487
Well, she's 10 weeks pregnant.
Give it another five weeks...

29:04.661 --> 29:06.871
...you'll be able to take her down.

29:07.038 --> 29:09.868
Because yoga's all about who wins, right?

29:10.041 --> 29:13.671
She says it's got her body going crazy.

29:13.837 --> 29:16.627
For sex, for men.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.048
I guess it's the hormones.

29:18.258 --> 29:19.798
Anything from the boyfriend?

29:20.301 --> 29:22.721
No. Nothing.

29:22.887 --> 29:27.347
He just shipped out
without even contacting her.

29:28.059 --> 29:30.229
I'm glad he's gone.

29:30.603 --> 29:33.063
- Ready for the associate's dinner?
- All set.

29:33.273 --> 29:35.823
Laura, sweetie, come on, let's go.

29:35.984 --> 29:37.614
I'm coming!

29:37.777 --> 29:40.067
Sometime tonight, sweetheart.

29:50.415 --> 29:52.455
Oh, my God.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.535
You look like a movie star.

29:56.212 --> 29:57.422
You like?

29:58.006 --> 30:00.836
I love that dress.

30:01.509 --> 30:04.099
You look absolutely stunning.

30:06.764 --> 30:07.854
Can I take your picture?

30:08.475 --> 30:10.225
All right.

30:10.393 --> 30:12.023
Listen, you have both of our cell numbers.

30:12.187 --> 30:14.647
And we'll be home by midnight.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.607
Okay, 1.

30:21.696 --> 30:23.196
I'll get the car.

30:23.364 --> 30:25.204
So beautiful.

30:28.536 --> 30:30.406
It's amazing the way he is with you.

30:30.580 --> 30:32.040
You are so lucky.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.630
Thank you. Thank you, Anna.

30:35.793 --> 30:37.003
And you have a good night.

30:37.170 --> 30:40.170
- You too. Have fun.
- All right. We will.

30:41.925 --> 30:43.045
"Today...

30:43.218 --> 30:44.718
...I am happy.

30:46.721 --> 30:50.311
I am in control of my life.

30:50.725 --> 30:54.935
I will experience the joy of pure love."

33:10.782 --> 33:12.032
Sorry.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.450
I was watching TV.

33:14.619 --> 33:16.749
- I guess I fell asleep.
- No problem.

33:16.913 --> 33:18.543
I fall asleep there all the time.

33:19.082 --> 33:20.582
I'd like a cup of coffee.

33:22.085 --> 33:24.375
Doctor says I'm allowed one cup a day.

33:24.921 --> 33:26.511
Okay.

33:30.385 --> 33:34.135
- One cup.
- Thank you.

33:35.682 --> 33:38.812
- God, it's so old.
- Miss Havisham.

33:39.477 --> 33:42.057
She's not old, she's ancient.

33:42.397 --> 33:44.977
I was never really a cat person,
but Laura loves her.

33:45.525 --> 33:49.235
All these years, she treated that cat
just like she was her baby.

33:49.612 --> 33:51.162
But when the real baby comes...

33:51.322 --> 33:53.912
...we'll have to see how old
Miss Havisham reacts then, huh?

33:55.785 --> 33:58.035
I told Laura she's lucky to have you.

34:00.081 --> 34:04.961
A husband who really loves his wife.

34:05.128 --> 34:07.258
Well, I like to think
that I'm the lucky one.

34:07.422 --> 34:09.762
I knew you would say something like that.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.261
Do you wanna feel?

34:18.808 --> 34:20.938
Here. Give me your hand.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.562
I'll show you what it feels like.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.228
Wait, I shouldn't say "it."

34:25.398 --> 34:27.148
It's not an it.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.476
He's your baby boy.

34:30.277 --> 34:31.777
You think it's a boy?

34:31.946 --> 34:33.946
I know it's a boy.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.155
I can feel him.

34:39.829 --> 34:42.539
He isn't even an inch long yet.

34:43.498 --> 34:47.339
But you can feel where
my tummy's starting to change.

34:48.004 --> 34:49.014
Feel that?

34:49.922 --> 34:51.922
How it's harder?

34:52.091 --> 34:54.221
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I can feel it.

34:54.427 --> 34:55.507
He's growing.

34:55.678 --> 34:58.508
Changing every day.

35:08.983 --> 35:11.863
Can I admit something to you?

35:13.529 --> 35:16.909
It's a little weird that
I'm pregnant with your baby.

35:18.201 --> 35:21.251
That you're inside of me...

35:21.412 --> 35:23.162
...in that way.

35:23.331 --> 35:26.291
Yeah, yeah, that is strange, isn't it?

35:26.918 --> 35:28.128
Yeah.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.134
But we're grateful for that.

35:30.296 --> 35:33.716
Because without you,
we couldn't do any of this.

35:33.883 --> 35:35.843
I like it.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.602
Yep.

35:43.559 --> 35:46.099
Hey, listen, next week we're
having our annual charity event...

35:46.270 --> 35:47.810
...here at the house. You should join us.

35:47.980 --> 35:50.070
- What's it for?
- We like to raise money...

35:50.233 --> 35:52.533
...for the Boys and Girls Club of America.

35:52.819 --> 35:56.239
You're amazing. Yes, I will come.

36:15.633 --> 36:17.593
What's so important?

36:22.598 --> 36:24.598
Good to see you too.

36:24.767 --> 36:26.597
I missed you, baby.

36:26.769 --> 36:29.269
I'm so glad you miss me.

36:30.815 --> 36:32.185
You look nice.

36:33.609 --> 36:38.609
I mean, living up there in that beautiful
big house, that must be nice.

36:38.781 --> 36:42.121
Did you know that you have
their only embryo?

36:42.285 --> 36:46.325
- It's a baby now.
- And they don't have any more.

36:46.831 --> 36:48.711
And in the eyes of the law...

36:48.875 --> 36:52.545
...since it's inside of you,
it belongs to us.

36:53.379 --> 36:57.969
We can decide to keep it for ourselves
anytime we want.

36:58.134 --> 37:01.304
- But I... I thought...
- Don't think.

37:01.679 --> 37:03.889
It's not your thing, baby.

37:04.056 --> 37:06.226
I'm the brains on this.

37:06.684 --> 37:08.944
You're just the uterus.

37:16.193 --> 37:18.403
So here's what you're gonna do.

37:18.571 --> 37:21.991
Every single month, you're gonna say...

37:22.158 --> 37:25.698
...that you're changing your mind,
and you're keeping it.

37:25.870 --> 37:27.620
And they'll pay.

37:27.788 --> 37:29.958
Maybe four grand, maybe more.

37:30.124 --> 37:31.834
Mike.

37:33.252 --> 37:36.342
They've been really good to me.

37:37.214 --> 37:40.384
John really wants to be a father.

37:46.849 --> 37:48.639
Does he?

37:49.685 --> 37:51.685
Does he really?

38:18.506 --> 38:20.586
You're into him.

38:22.301 --> 38:26.181
What do you think is gonna happen, Anna?

38:29.308 --> 38:33.268
You'll live happily ever after
with him in that big house?

38:36.399 --> 38:38.609
He doesn't care about you.

38:38.985 --> 38:41.735
You are like a cow to him.

38:44.115 --> 38:47.615
I'll do it. I'll do it, Mike. I'll do it.

38:48.244 --> 38:50.124
I know you will.

38:50.287 --> 38:52.497
I'll do it. I'll tell them.

38:58.671 --> 39:01.261
I'll do it for you, baby.

39:02.425 --> 39:05.135
Anything you want.

39:19.900 --> 39:24.700
It's from the firm. And tell Laura
she absolutely tops herself...

39:24.864 --> 39:27.374
- ...every time you guys do this.
- I'll do that. Thanks.

39:27.533 --> 39:30.583
Nobody knows this yet,
but Grafton Industries...

39:30.745 --> 39:34.535
...is unofficially
floating settlement offers.

39:34.707 --> 39:37.417
- You're not gonna settle with them?
- You kidding me?

39:37.585 --> 39:40.125
All this time, you've been telling me
we had them by the balls.

39:40.296 --> 39:42.166
I just wasn't sure.

39:42.339 --> 39:43.719
But now I am.

39:44.508 --> 39:47.298
This is gonna lock up partner
for you, John.

39:47.470 --> 39:49.010
You take them to trial.

39:49.180 --> 39:50.560
Gut them like a fish.

39:50.973 --> 39:52.733
I'll do that.

40:02.943 --> 40:04.493
Look, I was talking to Anna earlier.

40:04.653 --> 40:06.953
I didn't realise she was
your second cousin, man.

40:07.114 --> 40:08.994
- She is amazing.
- Todd, she's 21.

40:09.575 --> 40:11.735
My calculation, that's...

40:11.911 --> 40:14.001
That's legal plus three, right?

40:14.705 --> 40:17.785
I'm just checking with you. You wouldn't
mind if I asked her out, would you?

40:17.958 --> 40:19.498
No. You can ask her out.

40:24.340 --> 40:26.130
Normally, this is the part
of the evening...

40:26.300 --> 40:28.930
...where John asks all of you
to reach for your chequebooks.

40:29.762 --> 40:33.102
And I'm sure he'll manage
to get that in still...

40:33.724 --> 40:35.524
...but first, I wanted everyone to know...

40:35.684 --> 40:40.314
...how important the Boys and Girls
Clubs of America is to us.

40:40.481 --> 40:42.691
Especially to my husband.

40:42.858 --> 40:46.068
John loves children, and they love him.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.278
Thank you, John.

40:49.573 --> 40:51.623
I'd also like...

40:55.996 --> 40:59.706
I'd also like to thank all of you here...

40:59.875 --> 41:01.745
...for coming tonight and...

41:03.963 --> 41:05.513
Thank you.

41:05.714 --> 41:07.264
Thank you.

41:09.093 --> 41:10.683
Now you can all take out your chequebooks.

41:16.058 --> 41:18.058
Is that the dress you gave her?

41:18.227 --> 41:20.097
No. It's not.

41:20.271 --> 41:22.231
You want me to go talk to her?

41:22.398 --> 41:25.068
No, I will.

41:29.280 --> 41:30.700
Excuse me, gentlemen.

41:32.283 --> 41:34.373
- Anna.
- What's the matter?

41:34.535 --> 41:35.945
That's not the dress I gave you.

41:38.497 --> 41:40.537
God, I'm so sorry.

41:40.708 --> 41:43.338
It's just, the one that
you gave me didn't really fit.

41:44.128 --> 41:48.378
I was gonna ask you,
but you were so busy with the party.

41:49.633 --> 41:51.763
I can... I can go change...

41:51.927 --> 41:55.177
- ...right now.
- No, it's fine.

41:56.015 --> 41:57.925
You look great.

42:08.527 --> 42:10.397
Thank you for staying late.
I appreciate it.

42:10.571 --> 42:13.871
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Thank you.

42:46.774 --> 42:49.324
Well, no one fell in the pool.

42:49.485 --> 42:50.895
The rain stayed away.

42:51.946 --> 42:54.106
I'd call that a win.

42:54.323 --> 42:56.333
I found it in your record collection.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.459
Where's Laura?

43:02.623 --> 43:05.043
Oh, yeah, she crashed about an hour ago.

43:05.251 --> 43:07.841
Has to catch a flight
at 6 in the morning for work.

43:08.003 --> 43:09.843
So how'd our little story hold up?

43:12.007 --> 43:14.297
It was great.

43:14.468 --> 43:16.468
I was acting out a part.

43:17.263 --> 43:20.223
I had a secret in me that no one knew.

43:22.059 --> 43:23.139
Except you.

43:25.354 --> 43:27.024
You know everybody loves you?

43:27.439 --> 43:30.399
- Shut up.
- I'm serious.

43:30.776 --> 43:34.196
It made me think that I made
a good choice for the baby.

43:35.739 --> 43:38.409
Well, I thought that we were
the ones that made the choice.

43:38.742 --> 43:40.202
I could've said no.

43:40.828 --> 43:42.198
True.

43:43.706 --> 43:45.826
You're gonna make a great dad.

43:47.459 --> 43:50.879
Well, I'm glad it was you.

43:58.721 --> 44:03.271
I am gonna take a bath before bed.

44:09.106 --> 44:12.066
Thank you for everything, John.

44:52.149 --> 44:53.649
Is everything okay?

44:54.109 --> 44:56.989
Something's knocking
against the guest house.

46:42.593 --> 46:44.553
Is there coffee?

46:47.514 --> 46:48.684
Yeah. Coming right up.

46:50.058 --> 46:51.638
When does Laura get home?

46:51.852 --> 46:53.652
Tuesday.

46:58.859 --> 47:00.859
So, look, about last night...

47:07.576 --> 47:09.196
Todd Decker, he was...

47:09.369 --> 47:10.659
He was asking about you.

47:11.580 --> 47:16.040
The guy in the Grey suit? You know,
he was staring at me all night.

47:16.210 --> 47:17.840
Had to be uncomfortable for you.

47:18.795 --> 47:21.215
Can't blame a person for staring.

47:21.381 --> 47:24.221
It just means they like what they see.

47:25.260 --> 47:28.310
Actually, I prefer older guys.

47:29.264 --> 47:30.564
I always have.

47:30.724 --> 47:33.394
Mike was the youngest guy I ever dated.

47:33.560 --> 47:36.730
- Is that your phone?
- They'll leave a message.

47:38.398 --> 47:40.068
So I have to go into the office today.

47:40.234 --> 47:41.614
- On a Sunday?
- Yeah.

47:41.777 --> 47:44.567
I got an important deposition.
You can order out.

47:44.738 --> 47:46.158
I'm not gonna be back until late.

47:56.959 --> 47:59.629
How about we go out to the lake house?

47:59.795 --> 48:02.205
Just you and I, a weekend
before the baby comes.

48:02.381 --> 48:04.221
As soon as you get back from Houston.

48:04.383 --> 48:05.763
I'd like that.

48:05.926 --> 48:08.046
John, you're not gonna like this...

48:08.220 --> 48:10.430
...but Chef Folse wants me out here
tomorrow as well.

48:11.765 --> 48:14.725
- You're right. I don't like it.
- Should I say no?

48:15.269 --> 48:17.439
Should I just come home now?

48:18.021 --> 48:20.441
No, go ahead and stay. It's okay.

48:25.028 --> 48:28.118
- Hey.
- I hope you're sitting down.

48:29.116 --> 48:32.866
Chef Folse is offering me
a major promotion.

48:33.036 --> 48:34.036
Really?

48:34.204 --> 48:36.584
That's the reason he brought me down,
so he could offer me...

48:36.748 --> 48:39.708
- ...the CEO position.
- Congratulations.

48:42.254 --> 48:43.844
But I thought we talked about, you know...

48:44.006 --> 48:45.836
We have six months before the baby's born.

48:46.008 --> 48:49.298
I told him I could run the company while
we look for a permanent replacement.

48:49.469 --> 48:50.849
Why not just turn it down, sweetheart?

48:51.013 --> 48:52.063
I think I should take it...

48:52.222 --> 48:55.142
...even if it is only for six months.
But that's assuming you agree.

48:55.476 --> 48:57.806
I mean, I'd have to spend
a few days a month up here.

48:57.978 --> 48:59.728
But that wouldn't be
until later in the year.

48:59.896 --> 49:01.566
And you could come up for some weekends.

49:02.399 --> 49:03.819
Babe, are you happy for me?

49:03.984 --> 49:07.204
- I really wanna do this.
- Yeah, no, sweetheart. Definitely.

49:07.362 --> 49:09.532
I'm... I'm definitely happy for you.

49:09.740 --> 49:10.950
- It's unbelievable.
- Yeah?

49:11.116 --> 49:13.576
And you like spending time
with Anna, right?

49:15.162 --> 49:17.662
She might even have
a little thing for you.

49:17.873 --> 49:19.373
It's cute. Whatever.

49:19.541 --> 49:21.881
I mean, you're a big boy,
you can handle a little attention.

49:22.044 --> 49:24.054
Just congratulate me.

49:25.672 --> 49:27.802
- Jesus. What the...?
- What?

49:27.966 --> 49:31.796
No, congratulations, sweetheart.
I am so proud of you.

49:33.138 --> 49:34.138
I love you.

49:34.681 --> 49:36.311
I'll see you tomorrow.

49:36.475 --> 49:38.475
I love you too, babe.

51:04.229 --> 51:05.899
Anna!

51:07.482 --> 51:10.112
- Hi, John.
- What are you doing?

51:11.695 --> 51:12.945
Look, do you see this?

51:13.113 --> 51:14.873
This is me and Laura.
She is my wife, okay?

51:15.031 --> 51:18.541
This is our home.
Do you not understand that?

51:19.077 --> 51:20.827
I don't wanna have to say anything to her.

51:21.455 --> 51:23.995
Maybe I should go.

51:24.166 --> 51:27.376
No, wait, hold on. No, no. Please, please.

51:27.544 --> 51:29.634
Okay, look.

51:29.796 --> 51:34.256
Maybe... Maybe I said something
to encourage you in all this.

51:34.426 --> 51:36.846
And if I did do that, then I am sorry.

51:38.764 --> 51:40.394
Hello!

51:40.557 --> 51:43.557
- Hey.
- Hi.

51:43.727 --> 51:46.227
Didn't wanna wait until tomorrow,
so I grabbed the next flight.

51:46.396 --> 51:49.606
Good. That's... That's good.
Congratulations on everything.

51:49.775 --> 51:51.565
Hello, Laura.

51:56.656 --> 51:59.986
Laura just got a promotion at her company.

52:01.661 --> 52:04.041
Well, it's only until the baby comes.

52:04.206 --> 52:06.666
- How are you?
- Everything is fine.

52:07.834 --> 52:11.924
- Welcome home.
- It's good to be back.

52:12.088 --> 52:13.298
It's good to have you back.

52:50.460 --> 52:52.250
Hey, baby.

53:09.729 --> 53:10.729
Is anybody home?

53:13.233 --> 53:15.243
Anybody wanna make me a goddamn quiche?

53:15.402 --> 53:17.072
Mike, stop it!

53:19.364 --> 53:22.584
You're drunk. Okay? I was gonna call you.

53:25.912 --> 53:29.082
Before they find out
this whole thing's a scam...

53:29.291 --> 53:31.921
...you're gonna tell them
that you changed your mind.

53:32.085 --> 53:33.795
- You'll get them to give you money.
- No.

53:33.962 --> 53:35.712
Shut up!

53:37.090 --> 53:39.430
You're gonna take that money.

53:40.135 --> 53:43.755
And you and I are heading to Arizona...

53:44.139 --> 53:46.059
...because there is a guy there...

53:46.224 --> 53:49.024
...that's gonna give us another $15,000...

53:49.185 --> 53:54.065
...for a nice, new baby.

53:59.321 --> 54:01.071
If you don't...

54:01.907 --> 54:03.617
...I'm gonna come back here later...

54:04.492 --> 54:08.462
...and I'm gonna tell Laura and John...

54:08.622 --> 54:10.462
...you wanted to take
their last baby from them.

54:10.999 --> 54:12.459
No.

54:12.626 --> 54:14.036
They'll hate you.

54:20.592 --> 54:22.552
Clean this up.

54:54.417 --> 54:56.167
Here you go.

55:20.986 --> 55:21.986
Hey! Hey!

55:22.529 --> 55:25.239
Get... Get back here!

55:39.462 --> 55:42.302
Leave a message
and I'll call you right back.

55:42.465 --> 55:44.175
God.

55:44.342 --> 55:47.052
It's so goddamn typical of you.

55:47.220 --> 55:49.560
Some asshole buys you some fancy shit...

55:49.723 --> 55:52.183
...and you fall head over heels for him.

55:52.350 --> 55:54.230
Call me.

55:55.937 --> 55:58.727
Stupid bitch.

56:49.866 --> 56:51.446
Yeah.

56:52.494 --> 56:54.374
You're the brains, Mike.

57:15.225 --> 57:18.685
I am happy.

57:20.021 --> 57:23.441
I am in control...

57:23.608 --> 57:25.938
...of my life.

57:26.736 --> 57:30.696
I feel the joy...

57:30.865 --> 57:33.905
...of pure love.

57:51.386 --> 57:54.426
Hi, this is Laura Taylor.
Leave a message, and I'll...

57:57.642 --> 57:59.232
I can't hold the room. I'm sorry.

58:00.145 --> 58:01.895
You know what, let's just go ahead and...

58:02.605 --> 58:04.315
- Should we?
- I...

58:04.482 --> 58:05.902
- Okay. All right.
- I left a message.

58:07.110 --> 58:09.200
That's the femur.

58:10.321 --> 58:12.661
It's a boy.

58:13.366 --> 58:14.576
I told you.

58:15.243 --> 58:16.623
She's right.

58:16.786 --> 58:18.536
That's definitely a boy.

58:22.667 --> 58:25.457
Honey. No, wait.

58:25.628 --> 58:27.378
It's a boy.

58:28.339 --> 58:29.509
- It's a boy.
- No, babe...

58:29.674 --> 58:31.974
...just get down here as soon as you can.

58:33.553 --> 58:35.513
That's my son.

58:37.098 --> 58:38.598
I'm looking at my son.

58:43.855 --> 58:46.015
Look at his head.

58:47.650 --> 58:49.530
That's my son.

58:49.736 --> 58:52.106
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

59:00.246 --> 59:02.496
I'm sorry. I had it in my schedule
as 2:00.

59:02.665 --> 59:06.035
- Maybe you just entered it wrong.
- No, I didn't enter it wrong. I...

59:06.211 --> 59:07.751
Damn it. I know I didn't. I... I...

59:07.921 --> 59:11.591
Someone changed it in my phone!
I know that I put it in right.

59:11.758 --> 59:14.798
I booked my flights around it!
I know that I did! Damn it!

59:14.969 --> 59:17.059
- I... I...
- Laura. Stop it. Please.

59:18.431 --> 59:19.681
Please.

59:21.893 --> 59:26.483
This is the only time
we're ever gonna be able to do this.

59:26.648 --> 59:29.898
It's all right. Just don't worry about it.

59:38.826 --> 59:42.116
Let's just go somewhere.
I don't know, lunch.

59:45.250 --> 59:47.130
I can't.

59:47.961 --> 59:51.011
I left a client at the airport.

59:52.090 --> 59:54.340
I have to go back.

01:00:10.942 --> 01:00:12.532
Anna Walsh on 2.

01:00:12.694 --> 01:00:13.744
Hello?

01:00:13.903 --> 01:00:17.453
I'm so excited. A boy.

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:21.325
I knew it. Let's have lunch today.
To celebrate.

01:00:21.536 --> 01:00:23.746
Just you and me. I promise it'll be fun.

01:00:23.913 --> 01:00:25.833
- Anna, is there anything actually wrong?
- Why?

01:00:25.999 --> 01:00:27.709
Because you shouldn't
be calling me at work.

01:00:27.917 --> 01:00:30.457
Okay? I cannot sneak away,
I will not have lunch with you.

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:33.340
I have appointments all afternoon.
Like I said earlier...

01:00:39.971 --> 01:00:43.521
Mr. Taylor's office. Please hold.

01:00:44.183 --> 01:00:47.233
- Anna Walsh.
- Tell her I left for the day.

01:00:56.779 --> 01:00:59.909
- What is it?
- Why are you lying to me?

01:01:00.491 --> 01:01:02.201
What are you talking about?

01:01:02.368 --> 01:01:05.158
I'd never lie to you, John.

01:01:06.205 --> 01:01:09.165
I've always told you the truth.

01:01:10.043 --> 01:01:12.093
But not you.

01:01:12.462 --> 01:01:13.502
Why are you saying that?

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:16.051
Because I'm right here.

01:01:28.519 --> 01:01:30.649
This is for you.

01:01:31.147 --> 01:01:33.477
A congratulations.

01:01:34.442 --> 01:01:36.492
All right. No, we're not gonna do this.

01:01:36.652 --> 01:01:39.322
We're not gonna do this.

01:01:39.906 --> 01:01:41.276
Let's do something fun.

01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:48.785
Nope. We're not doing anything fun.

01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:58.304
What a surprise.
Laura's working late again!

01:01:58.466 --> 01:02:00.296
Why did you think
she would make a good mother?

01:02:00.468 --> 01:02:03.008
- Enough!
- We're so different.

01:02:03.221 --> 01:02:04.851
She couldn't even stay pregnant.

01:02:05.014 --> 01:02:07.024
I wonder if she actually even wanted to.

01:02:07.225 --> 01:02:08.635
Are you sure she had miscarriages?

01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:11.400
Because you know there are ways
to fake that, right?

01:02:11.562 --> 01:02:15.532
- Are you out of your mind?
- You need to be nicer to me, John.

01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:18.151
I will leave. The law says I can.

01:02:18.319 --> 01:02:22.619
This is my baby. Mike says we can sell it.

01:02:26.786 --> 01:02:28.656
- John!
- You know what?

01:02:29.789 --> 01:02:31.829
Leave. Go. Get out of the house!

01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:34.249
- You don't mean that.
- Oh, yes, I do.

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:37.630
I'll tell Laura everything.
It will kill her. It will break her heart.

01:02:37.797 --> 01:02:40.047
But you know what? We'll survive it.

01:02:40.383 --> 01:02:43.683
We'll pick up the pieces and move on
because that's what we do.

01:02:43.845 --> 01:02:47.135
But what about you? You'll be alone.

01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:50.976
You'll be broke,
with a kid that's not even really yours.

01:02:51.477 --> 01:02:53.187
So go for it.

01:02:53.354 --> 01:02:55.194
Leave.

01:03:00.403 --> 01:03:02.953
I just want you.

01:03:25.052 --> 01:03:27.432
- White here.
- Hey, Roland, it's John.

01:03:27.597 --> 01:03:30.927
Hey, what's up? What, the old man
needs another rock looked under?

01:03:31.142 --> 01:03:34.102
No, actually, I need a favour.
And it's not business.

01:03:34.312 --> 01:03:35.902
- It's personal.
- Sure, John.

01:03:36.856 --> 01:03:39.686
There's a guy I'd like you to look into.
His name is Mike Mitchell.

01:03:39.859 --> 01:03:41.819
He's Navy, based in Louisiana.

01:03:41.986 --> 01:03:44.736
He's been deployed about two months.
Just need a history on him.

01:03:44.906 --> 01:03:47.156
Anything you can find would be great.

01:03:47.325 --> 01:03:50.235
I'm on it. Anything for you, John.

01:03:50.411 --> 01:03:51.911
My man.

01:04:04.425 --> 01:04:05.465
You wanted to see me?

01:04:06.511 --> 01:04:07.551
Have a seat, John.

01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:17.561
Look, you know
the firm monitors computer use...

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:19.360
...and e-mail accounts.

01:04:19.524 --> 01:04:21.824
The system's set up
to automatically snag...

01:04:21.984 --> 01:04:24.824
...certain types of files,
things that could...

01:04:25.655 --> 01:04:28.065
...embarrass the company.

01:04:47.885 --> 01:04:51.555
Todd recognised her from your party.

01:04:51.722 --> 01:04:53.722
She's not your relative, is she?

01:04:53.891 --> 01:04:56.891
No. She's our surrogate.

01:04:57.061 --> 01:04:58.981
And I don't see
how this is company business.

01:04:59.146 --> 01:05:01.436
Anna has been getting
prenatal care from a clinic...

01:05:01.607 --> 01:05:03.897
...that happens to be a subsidiary
of Grafton Industries.

01:05:04.068 --> 01:05:06.818
She is a patient of the very people...

01:05:06.988 --> 01:05:10.118
...we're about to take to court.

01:05:10.408 --> 01:05:13.238
That's a big deal, John.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.620
I'm giving the case to Todd.

01:05:16.831 --> 01:05:18.831
I hope you understand.

01:05:20.376 --> 01:05:22.876
I'm sorry, John. That video got bounced
straight to the old man.

01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:25.335
I think I just lost my job.

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:28.880
You ready for things to get worse?

01:05:29.093 --> 01:05:30.803
I don't think that's possible.

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:33.510
Remember that guy you asked me
to run a check on? Mitchell?

01:05:35.308 --> 01:05:36.848
- Yeah.
- Two years ago...

01:05:37.018 --> 01:05:39.438
...he was discharged from the military
for some assaults.

01:05:39.604 --> 01:05:41.274
Regular dickhead shit.

01:05:41.439 --> 01:05:44.189
But after I saw the video,
I got to thinking about that girl.

01:05:44.358 --> 01:05:46.148
- Your girl.
- Yeah, and...?

01:05:46.319 --> 01:05:48.399
Well, her real name isn't Walsh.

01:05:48.696 --> 01:05:51.446
She got married at 19 in Little Rock.

01:05:51.616 --> 01:05:54.156
Before that, she was Anna Devost.

01:05:54.952 --> 01:05:57.042
Which is why the surrogate agency
missed this.

01:05:58.581 --> 01:06:01.751
Marijuana. A DUI.

01:06:01.917 --> 01:06:03.877
Nothing horrible, really.

01:06:04.045 --> 01:06:06.755
But not exactly the picture of innocence.

01:06:06.922 --> 01:06:10.342
So I dug a little deeper.

01:06:10.509 --> 01:06:11.639
She was born in Memphis.

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:14.850
Her parents died when she was 3.

01:06:15.014 --> 01:06:17.604
Raised by foster parents.

01:06:17.767 --> 01:06:20.647
She lived with them for 12 years.

01:06:22.688 --> 01:06:25.568
Now, this took some work to get to.

01:06:25.733 --> 01:06:28.033
When she was 16,
she attacks her foster dad...

01:06:28.194 --> 01:06:30.204
...with a pair of scissors.

01:06:30.363 --> 01:06:32.283
Killed him.

01:06:32.448 --> 01:06:34.488
Seems she had a reason.

01:06:34.659 --> 01:06:37.869
The guy was sexually abusing her.

01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:41.829
State takes over...

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:44.249
...puts her in psych.

01:06:47.713 --> 01:06:49.883
She's a minor, so the records are sealed.

01:06:50.049 --> 01:06:54.049
But when she turns 18,
she walks out and is gone.

01:06:54.345 --> 01:06:56.715
She's dangerous, John.

01:06:56.889 --> 01:06:59.519
You're right where you should be.

01:06:59.684 --> 01:07:03.024
And you slowly begin
to reawaken yourself...

01:07:03.187 --> 01:07:06.017
...with small movements.

01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:08.780
You appreciate your mind and your body...

01:07:08.943 --> 01:07:12.073
...for the accomplishments of this lesson.

01:07:16.242 --> 01:07:19.372
Thank you so much.

01:07:19.537 --> 01:07:21.617
- Thank you.
- Okay, it's my turn.

01:07:23.833 --> 01:07:26.173
This was John's great-grandmother's...

01:07:26.335 --> 01:07:29.955
...and then my mother and then mine.

01:07:30.131 --> 01:07:31.511
I always wanted you to have it.

01:07:31.674 --> 01:07:34.184
John told me about this.

01:07:40.307 --> 01:07:43.017
Isn't it lovely?

01:07:43.477 --> 01:07:45.187
Oh, that's so cute.

01:07:56.949 --> 01:07:59.079
Thank you.

01:09:58.612 --> 01:10:00.612
What are you doing here in my office?

01:10:02.533 --> 01:10:04.873
You picked me.

01:10:06.161 --> 01:10:08.871
It wasn't the other way around.

01:10:09.582 --> 01:10:11.212
When you're around me...

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:13.415
...my whole body reacts.

01:10:14.753 --> 01:10:16.263
I can't think.

01:10:16.422 --> 01:10:18.132
I can't breathe.

01:10:18.757 --> 01:10:20.007
I need you.

01:10:23.512 --> 01:10:25.312
I know.

01:10:25.472 --> 01:10:27.682
You want to be a good man.

01:10:27.892 --> 01:10:30.142
But how do you know you love your wife?

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:35.270
If you kiss me...

01:10:37.484 --> 01:10:41.284
...what if you found out
that this was more real?

01:10:45.367 --> 01:10:47.407
- Kiss me.
- No, I'm not gonna kiss you.

01:10:47.578 --> 01:10:48.788
- Kiss me.
- No.

01:10:48.954 --> 01:10:51.504
Or I'll tell her things
that will make her leave you.

01:10:54.585 --> 01:10:56.295
Kiss me, John.

01:10:57.755 --> 01:10:58.875
- Please, John.
- No. No.

01:10:59.048 --> 01:11:01.758
- Kiss me. John.
- No. No!

01:11:22.154 --> 01:11:24.324
I can't live like this.

01:11:33.999 --> 01:11:35.919
Look...

01:11:37.419 --> 01:11:39.709
...nobody knows what's gonna
happen in the future.

01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:42.840
What do you mean?

01:11:44.009 --> 01:11:46.429
I mean, I know what you want.

01:11:49.223 --> 01:11:51.603
But you're gonna have to trust me.

01:11:53.686 --> 01:11:55.516
Okay?

01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:01.654
I need you to go back to bed.

01:12:09.201 --> 01:12:10.791
So will you do that for me?

01:12:14.873 --> 01:12:17.003
I love you, John.

01:12:18.168 --> 01:12:19.918
I know.

01:12:56.457 --> 01:12:57.997
No!

01:13:09.386 --> 01:13:11.136
- You asshole!
- Whoa, wait a minute. Hold up!

01:13:11.305 --> 01:13:14.305
You lied to me! Stay away from me.

01:13:15.768 --> 01:13:18.188
- Come here.
- I'll kill you!

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:27.613
Anna.

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:28.780
- Stay away from me.
- Anna.

01:13:28.947 --> 01:13:30.617
Leave me alone!

01:13:30.783 --> 01:13:32.703
I hate you!

01:13:32.868 --> 01:13:34.868
Okay. Give me the knife.
Give me the knife.

01:13:35.037 --> 01:13:37.117
- Give me the knife.
- No! No!

01:13:37.289 --> 01:13:40.419
- Give me the knife. Give me the knife.
- I wanna leave!

01:13:41.168 --> 01:13:42.588
Relax. Just relax.

01:13:42.878 --> 01:13:43.998
- Relax.
- Anna!

01:13:44.171 --> 01:13:45.841
Stop it!

01:13:46.006 --> 01:13:47.466
What the hell is going on?

01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:49.680
He doesn't love you!

01:13:50.344 --> 01:13:51.724
He told me!

01:13:51.887 --> 01:13:54.597
Every time he screws me,
that's what he tells me!

01:13:54.765 --> 01:13:56.925
- What are you talking about?
- I hate you!

01:13:58.435 --> 01:13:59.845
Anna, please.

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.150
Stop this.

01:14:05.109 --> 01:14:08.859
- What's going on here?
- Please don't let him hurt me.

01:14:09.029 --> 01:14:12.119
- We got a call, a disturbance.
- No. She is having our baby.

01:14:12.282 --> 01:14:13.662
She has to come back inside.

01:14:13.867 --> 01:14:17.747
He's been screwing me. Every night.

01:14:17.913 --> 01:14:21.883
Using me. Lying to me.

01:14:22.042 --> 01:14:24.802
He told me that he loves me.

01:14:25.087 --> 01:14:27.417
- That's not true.
- I hate him!

01:14:27.965 --> 01:14:29.715
Come in the house. Let me talk to you.

01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:31.760
- Don't come any further.
- Listen...

01:14:31.927 --> 01:14:34.887
- Sir, you need to step back.
- Listen, she is carrying our baby.

01:14:35.055 --> 01:14:38.885
Sir, did you hear me? Step back. Now!

01:14:41.478 --> 01:14:43.058
Now.

01:14:54.449 --> 01:14:55.829
Okay, drive careful, ma'am.

01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:11.550
None of what she said was true, okay?
None of it. Babe, she is lying!

01:15:11.717 --> 01:15:13.717
- I never even touched her.
- Whatever it was...

01:15:13.886 --> 01:15:15.966
...you have been lying to me!

01:15:16.138 --> 01:15:17.758
And now she's gone with our baby!

01:15:17.931 --> 01:15:19.101
I've never lied to you.

01:15:19.474 --> 01:15:21.234
- Did you sleep with her?
- No.

01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:24.148
- Did you kiss her?
- No.

01:15:24.313 --> 01:15:26.233
Then why didn't you say anything?

01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:30.740
I didn't wanna ruin
the experience for you.

01:15:30.903 --> 01:15:34.073
I thought that I could handle it, okay?
I knew that I was handling it.

01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:35.779
And then it just... It just got worse.

01:15:35.949 --> 01:15:37.949
And then she threatened
to take the baby and...

01:15:38.118 --> 01:15:39.578
Because I couldn't have a baby...

01:15:39.745 --> 01:15:41.455
- ...that I'm not a woman...
- No, no.

01:15:41.622 --> 01:15:43.922
- ...that I can't handle it, you...
- No, I knew you could.

01:15:44.082 --> 01:15:46.882
- I knew, I just...
- No, you didn't.

01:15:47.044 --> 01:15:48.464
- I didn't wanna ruin it.
- You lied.

01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:50.799
Baby, I just didn't wanna ruin it.

01:15:52.216 --> 01:15:54.216
I wanted it for you.

01:15:55.552 --> 01:15:58.182
I wish I could say that
it never happens, but it does.

01:15:59.348 --> 01:16:01.478
So when does it become a kidnapping?

01:16:01.975 --> 01:16:04.725
Never. It never becomes kidnapping.

01:16:04.895 --> 01:16:07.895
Even though it's your egg,
fertilised by your husband's sperm...

01:16:08.065 --> 01:16:10.105
...it's your embryo...

01:16:10.317 --> 01:16:12.487
...but it's growing inside her uterus.

01:16:12.653 --> 01:16:15.573
The law views her as the birth mother.

01:16:15.739 --> 01:16:18.739
And when she gives birth,
it is her child...

01:16:18.909 --> 01:16:21.249
...until she relinquishes that right.

01:16:34.466 --> 01:16:37.426
Yes, thank you,
I'd like to hold for the doctor.

01:16:38.887 --> 01:16:40.717
I'm not gonna make partner.

01:16:41.682 --> 01:16:42.772
Why?

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:45.350
Anna came to the office,
caused a lot of problems.

01:16:46.395 --> 01:16:48.645
Think Cooper's gonna let me go.

01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:02.411
Dr. Park just got a notice
from a pharmacy in Mexico...

01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:04.867
- ...where Anna bought Cytotec.
- She's in Mexico?

01:17:05.038 --> 01:17:07.668
- No, she had it shipped here.
- What is Cytotec?

01:17:07.874 --> 01:17:09.674
Well, it's normally prescribed
for ulcers...

01:17:09.835 --> 01:17:14.045
...but if a pregnant woman takes
enough of it, it could induce labour...

01:17:14.256 --> 01:17:15.466
...or terminate.

01:17:16.925 --> 01:17:18.545
Where is the medicine being shipped?

01:17:18.719 --> 01:17:20.509
I got the address. Let's go.

01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:26.940
Hello?

01:17:28.353 --> 01:17:30.813
- Is she there?
- No.

01:17:30.981 --> 01:17:32.771
No, she's not here. Where are you?

01:17:34.443 --> 01:17:35.573
I want you to come back.

01:17:35.736 --> 01:17:38.406
Not to her. Just to you.

01:17:38.613 --> 01:17:41.703
God, I miss you.

01:17:41.867 --> 01:17:44.447
- Isn't that crazy?
- I can meet you.

01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:48.369
I can meet you today, right now.
Where are you?

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:50.960
It can't be like it was.

01:17:51.126 --> 01:17:54.296
Everything has to change.

01:17:58.050 --> 01:18:02.720
I swear to you, if she does anything
to hurt my child, I will kill her.

01:18:04.056 --> 01:18:06.306
She hasn't been here today.

01:18:06.475 --> 01:18:08.055
Box is empty.

01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:11.310
I think if she calls again, you know,
I could...

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.900
...lure her to a public place,
have the police there waiting for her.

01:18:15.067 --> 01:18:16.567
Except she's not guilty of anything.

01:18:16.735 --> 01:18:18.775
She is guilty. Okay?

01:18:18.945 --> 01:18:21.365
She ordered a drug to end the pregnancy.

01:18:21.573 --> 01:18:23.373
You want me to explain that to a judge?

01:18:23.992 --> 01:18:26.502
I mean, you'd win the case,
but you'd lose your child.

01:18:26.703 --> 01:18:28.503
She could kill your baby today.

01:18:28.663 --> 01:18:30.923
You don't have time
to bring this to the police.

01:18:31.083 --> 01:18:34.423
She was part of the scam, then she fell
in love with you. That's what we have.

01:18:34.628 --> 01:18:37.628
She could have that baby any minute
now. She could be disappearing.

01:18:37.798 --> 01:18:40.838
Oh, that girl ain't going nowhere.
She loves you.

01:18:41.802 --> 01:18:43.222
You gotta put her at ease.

01:18:43.428 --> 01:18:45.258
- You need to make her happy.
- Make her happy?

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:47.890
- Yes.
- No. I know this girl.

01:18:48.058 --> 01:18:50.018
Making her happy is not an option.

01:18:50.185 --> 01:18:53.355
You're wrong. You're wrong.
You give her what she wants.

01:18:53.522 --> 01:18:56.272
Convince her you're in love with her.
Tell her that you're leaving me.

01:18:56.441 --> 01:18:57.821
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Yes.

01:18:57.984 --> 01:19:00.404
She is in love with you.
If you make her believe...

01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:02.700
...that you feel the same way,
she will stay with you.

01:19:02.864 --> 01:19:04.914
She will have the baby for you.

01:19:05.075 --> 01:19:06.535
- Laura's right.
- No, she isn't.

01:19:06.701 --> 01:19:10.041
In her mind, I am keeping
the two of you apart.

01:19:10.205 --> 01:19:11.915
You convince her that you love her.

01:19:13.208 --> 01:19:15.288
When you meet her,
you have to make her believe you.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:18.340
That you want to have the baby
with her and not with me.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:28.970
I don't wanna know what you have to do.
I don't ever...

01:19:29.141 --> 01:19:30.431
...need to hear about it.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:36.310
But you do whatever it takes
to bring my baby back.

01:19:51.413 --> 01:19:54.293
You should take her to the lake house.

01:19:54.749 --> 01:19:58.419
Tell her that you're thinking
of moving there.

01:19:58.753 --> 01:20:00.553
With her.

01:20:32.454 --> 01:20:34.504
Stay with me.

01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:42.960
The new exhibit's right that way.

01:21:44.192 --> 01:21:46.192
Wait, Anna.

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:48.280
Anna.

01:22:45.795 --> 01:22:47.505
Oh, my God.

01:22:47.672 --> 01:22:49.052
I love it.

01:22:54.971 --> 01:22:56.891
It's so beautiful.

01:22:57.098 --> 01:23:00.018
Yeah, it was my father's. Laura hates it.

01:23:02.479 --> 01:23:04.519
I guess I should've sold it...

01:23:04.689 --> 01:23:06.569
...but part of me
always wanted to live here.

01:23:27.504 --> 01:23:31.014
God, I love it so much, John.

01:23:32.801 --> 01:23:34.511
Can we live here?

01:23:34.678 --> 01:23:36.468
Just us?

01:23:36.638 --> 01:23:38.428
Yes.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:41.060
After I file those divorce papers.

01:23:41.226 --> 01:23:43.226
Just us.

01:23:50.318 --> 01:23:54.858
I'm gonna make you so happy, John.

01:23:55.824 --> 01:23:58.244
I want you to know...

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:02.580
...everything that I am...

01:24:03.707 --> 01:24:05.827
...is yours.

01:24:11.631 --> 01:24:13.801
All of me...

01:24:14.467 --> 01:24:16.637
...everything...

01:24:18.054 --> 01:24:20.144
...forever.

01:25:14.569 --> 01:25:16.359
Laura?

01:25:21.159 --> 01:25:22.989
Laura?

01:25:52.106 --> 01:25:54.186
I couldn't sleep.

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:05.410
It's beautiful.

01:26:06.621 --> 01:26:08.211
A leap of faith.

01:26:24.639 --> 01:26:26.389
Yeah.

01:26:28.643 --> 01:26:31.983
I can't stay long,
because I told her that...

01:26:32.146 --> 01:26:33.516
Yeah.

01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:36.150
I told her I had to pick up some papers.

01:26:37.652 --> 01:26:39.742
Okay.

01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:45.409
Laura, I...

01:26:45.577 --> 01:26:47.157
- It's okay.
- No. I...

01:26:47.996 --> 01:26:50.666
- ...just...
- It's okay.

01:26:51.207 --> 01:26:53.077
Come here.

01:28:07.075 --> 01:28:08.985
She's gonna stay
at the lake house tonight.

01:28:11.162 --> 01:28:14.122
She agreed to go to
the doctor's with me tomorrow.

01:28:20.338 --> 01:28:22.838
It's happening. Contractions.

01:28:23.007 --> 01:28:26.177
I'm okay. I'm going to St. Agnes Hospital.

01:28:26.344 --> 01:28:27.894
Come as soon as you can.

01:28:28.054 --> 01:28:29.474
It's our baby.

01:28:29.639 --> 01:28:30.969
- I have to go there.
- No. No, no.

01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:32.730
- She cannot see you.
- John.

01:28:32.892 --> 01:28:35.102
I know, just trust me. Okay?

01:28:35.269 --> 01:28:37.649
Please, just trust me.

01:28:46.698 --> 01:28:49.198
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a patient. Anna Walsh.

01:28:49.367 --> 01:28:52.907
- Are you a relative? Okay.
- She's having my son, yes.

01:28:53.121 --> 01:28:55.161
- I got here as soon as I could.
- Thanks for coming.

01:28:55.373 --> 01:28:58.173
No, I'm sorry. I don't have a patient
listed under the last name Walsh.

01:28:58.334 --> 01:29:00.424
Try Taylor. My last name is Taylor.

01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:04.665
- No. No Taylors.
- That's... That's impossible.

01:29:04.841 --> 01:29:06.761
No, there has to be a Taylor
or a Walsh in there.

01:29:06.926 --> 01:29:08.586
- No, I have neither.
- She's not here, John.

01:29:08.761 --> 01:29:10.811
She never checked in.

01:29:11.681 --> 01:29:13.311
Where the hell could she be?

01:30:04.901 --> 01:30:07.031
Miss Havisham?

01:30:09.322 --> 01:30:11.952
Miss Havisham, where are you?

01:30:16.871 --> 01:30:19.421
Miss Havisham...

01:30:22.001 --> 01:30:25.051
Are you hiding in the pantry?

01:31:34.365 --> 01:31:36.445
What the hell is that smell?

01:32:19.035 --> 01:32:22.365
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:32:24.957 --> 01:32:26.957
Oh, my God.

01:32:57.490 --> 01:32:58.570
Oh, Jesus.

01:33:26.435 --> 01:33:29.555
Hi, this is Laura Taylor.
Leave a message...

01:33:46.122 --> 01:33:47.122
Oh, God.

01:33:55.548 --> 01:33:56.838
Okay. Okay.

01:33:59.176 --> 01:34:00.586
911, what's your emergency?

01:34:00.761 --> 01:34:03.431
Please, come now. She's having the baby.

01:34:03.597 --> 01:34:04.597
No!

01:34:05.516 --> 01:34:06.636
No, no!

01:34:22.325 --> 01:34:25.075
She's dropping.
Let's get those fluids going.

01:34:25.786 --> 01:34:28.326
Laura. Laura, can you hear me?

01:34:28.497 --> 01:34:29.617
She's unresponsive.

01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:30.830
- Wide open.
- Okay.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.420
We got a female, early 40s.
Possible head trauma.

01:34:33.586 --> 01:34:36.666
Pressure 85/55 and dropping.

01:34:36.839 --> 01:34:38.839
All right, let's cross-type and match.

01:34:39.008 --> 01:34:40.468
Make sure the CAT scan...

01:35:40.528 --> 01:35:43.658
Hey. Can you hear me?

01:35:45.032 --> 01:35:46.782
John?

01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:49.910
You're gonna be fine.

01:35:50.121 --> 01:35:52.831
Doctor says you just have
a bad concussion, some stitches...

01:35:52.998 --> 01:35:55.418
...but you're gonna be okay.

01:35:55.584 --> 01:35:56.794
Where's my baby?

01:35:57.878 --> 01:35:59.838
We can't find Anna.

01:36:03.926 --> 01:36:05.586
It's Roland. Yeah.

01:36:05.761 --> 01:36:07.931
I'm across the river
at Montgomery Hospital.

01:36:08.097 --> 01:36:11.097
Anna walked into ER in labour
after she attacked Laura.

01:36:11.308 --> 01:36:14.978
Gave birth to a healthy baby boy,
according to her records.

01:36:15.521 --> 01:36:17.691
She left later that evening
and took the baby with her.

01:36:17.982 --> 01:36:20.152
- Where did she go?
- She disappeared.

01:36:20.317 --> 01:36:22.027
I told the police to put an APB...

01:36:22.236 --> 01:36:24.406
...out on her in every city
she's ever lived in...

01:36:24.572 --> 01:36:28.122
...including that military base in
Pensacola where Mike was stationed.

01:36:28.325 --> 01:36:30.735
John, she has that baby...

01:36:30.911 --> 01:36:32.661
...she's gonna wanna be someplace safe.

01:36:32.872 --> 01:36:35.082
- And close by.
- All right, thanks.

01:36:37.334 --> 01:36:41.424
The lake house.
It's gotta be the lake house.

01:36:42.465 --> 01:36:44.715
- No, babe. What are you doing?
- John.

01:36:45.009 --> 01:36:46.929
- Please, I have to go.
- I can't let you do that.

01:36:47.094 --> 01:36:50.564
John, I am going to get my child back.

01:36:59.273 --> 01:37:00.273
No. No, no, no.

01:37:00.441 --> 01:37:02.531
I let you come with me,
but this is as far as you go.

01:37:02.693 --> 01:37:04.653
Look, we know that she's dangerous.

01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:07.110
Just wait in the car.

01:39:16.035 --> 01:39:17.285
Hey.

01:39:24.209 --> 01:39:25.709
Shit.

01:40:32.528 --> 01:40:34.858
Oh, God! What happened?

01:40:36.365 --> 01:40:38.195
I got you. Just get in the car.

01:40:38.367 --> 01:40:40.787
- I got it.
- Come on. We gotta move.

01:40:50.295 --> 01:40:52.045
We better hurry up.

01:41:23.162 --> 01:41:24.662
Oh, shit.

01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:27.540
Cover the baby!

01:41:39.219 --> 01:41:42.509
I am sick of you, you crazy bitch.

01:43:06.557 --> 01:43:08.597
It's gonna be okay.
