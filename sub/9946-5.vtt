www.addic7ed.com

00:03.120 --> 00:06.039
Tickets this way for
the Chatsworth Express.

00:06.040 --> 00:11.239
Come and watch pikeys making a
mess of the lives they were given

00:11.240 --> 00:13.079
by 'im upstairs

00:14.080 --> 00:18.079
and kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.119
Stay away!

00:19.120 --> 00:22.239
What sounds on earth
could ever replace...Oi!

00:22.240 --> 00:25.799
..kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:25.800 --> 00:28.439
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:28.440 --> 00:32.439
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented,

00:33.360 --> 00:37.079
to calm us all down,
stop us going mental.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.079
These are Chatsworth
Estate's basic essentials.

00:41.560 --> 00:45.559
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.879
You shit on our heads
but you pay the taxes.

00:53.560 --> 00:56.559
Imagine a Britain without
Chatsworth buccaneers

00:56.560 --> 00:59.439
who'd cum on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.879
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.759
Make...poverty...history.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.279
Cheaper drugs now!

01:09.280 --> 01:13.279
Scatter!

01:19.080 --> 01:22.359
So, Maxine, then...

01:22.360 --> 01:26.359
'Here's the problem with society.
We've got too much choice.

01:28.040 --> 01:32.039
'Every decade that rolls past,
we get more and more lifestyle options.

01:33.480 --> 01:37.479
'And the one thing you can
guarantee about people,

01:39.200 --> 01:43.199
'give 'em a choice and they'll
pick the wrong fuckin' one.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.959
'And then it's too late.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.279
'Can't rewind, can't go back,
you've made your choice

01:50.280 --> 01:54.279
'and you and everyone else
has got to live with it.'

02:00.960 --> 02:04.959
ASAP.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.318
Was happy to feed Stella.
Make sure the bills were paid.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.919
Stop dad from choking
on his own vomit.

02:11.920 --> 02:15.519
Wasn't choking so much
as a terrified gargle.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.839
But you just broke
the camel's back.

02:17.840 --> 02:21.839
Camel?

02:23.240 --> 02:27.239
Hey, brekkie!

02:27.680 --> 02:29.799
Just take, take, take,
with you, innit?

02:29.800 --> 02:33.239
Should've got that tidy thing you
hang around with to sew it for you,

02:33.240 --> 02:35.879
instead of pissing Liam off.
That's her job, see?

02:35.880 --> 02:36.679
Maxine?

02:36.680 --> 02:37.119
Maxine? Yeah.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.159
Maxine? Yeah. We broke up.

02:38.160 --> 02:38.599
Remember?

02:38.600 --> 02:41.039
Remember? Give you the sharp
end of the elbow, did she?

02:41.040 --> 02:42.319
No. I dumped her.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.279
Seriously. I did.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.239
It was me. All me.

02:47.240 --> 02:49.319
It was me. All me.
She's out of your league, mate.

02:49.320 --> 02:53.319
You're supposed to hold onto those ones,
not chuck 'em away.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.759
It just didn't feel right.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.959
Good in the sack, made you laugh,

03:00.960 --> 03:04.319
bit of a brain on her, cracking
tits you could stare at for hours?

03:04.320 --> 03:05.759
Well, yeah.

03:05.760 --> 03:09.759
So what the fuck didn't feel right?

03:10.920 --> 03:14.279
Well, while you're ruminating on
your failings as a human being,

03:14.280 --> 03:18.279
two eggs, sunny side up.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.519
So, you'll do it, then.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.919
I dunno. It's weird.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.079
Statement, not a question.
I've already told my mum and dad

03:29.080 --> 03:32.039
that I'm bringing my boyfriend
to their anniversary party.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.519
Oh, great.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.319
What?

03:35.320 --> 03:36.719
Congratulations.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.319
But I'm not a doctor.
And even if I was,

03:39.320 --> 03:42.559
I'd be a gay doctor,
so that's even less use for you.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.679
You're the only
half-decent man I know.

03:44.680 --> 03:48.319
So show up, slap a smile on your
face and pretend you like me.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.839
Why you so bothered about
impressing your parents, anyway?

03:49.840 --> 03:52.399
Why you so bothered about impressing your
parents, anyway? Because they think I'm a
fuck-up.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.159
And I am a fuck-up.

03:54.160 --> 03:58.159
But I'm not going to provide
them with any more ammunition.

04:00.560 --> 04:04.559
Tell you what,
that black goes in...

04:04.800 --> 04:08.799
..and you're on.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.719
You all right, mate. >

04:20.839 --> 04:24.839
Look, I don't want to sound like a tit,
but your angle's all wrong.

04:31.680 --> 04:35.679
Come on, then.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:45.520 --> 04:47.199
That was actually pretty good.

04:47.200 --> 04:51.199
Nothing.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.359
What, that doesn't count!

05:00.360 --> 05:02.039
You said the black had to go in.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.599
You didn't say who by.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.599
Wear something straight.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.959
Got any Tom Bakers?

05:20.960 --> 05:21.359
What?

05:21.360 --> 05:24.079
What? Scarves.
You know, like Tom Baker wore.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.679
Ladieswear, third floor.

05:26.680 --> 05:27.959
Eh?

05:27.960 --> 05:30.279
It's the lowest form of wit, love.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.159
Never mind.

05:32.160 --> 05:35.439
Going to look like a real
twat if I turn up without one.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.359
Bournemouth, three days.
Doctor Who convention.

05:38.360 --> 05:40.879
There's going to be a real,
live Cyberman there.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.359
And I fucking love Cybermen.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.679
And I fucking love Cybermen. 4.50.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.799
I hear that Karen Maguire's
coming out of prison today.

05:46.800 --> 05:47.839
I hear that Karen Maguire's coming
out of prison today. You sure?

05:47.840 --> 05:48.759
Yeah.

05:48.760 --> 05:49.999
Yeah. And it was hospital,
not prison?

05:50.000 --> 05:53.839
Yeah. And it was hospital, not prison? No.
Mimi definitely said prison.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.399
Ta. See ya.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.399
Yeah, live long and prosper.

06:15.640 --> 06:16.839
Are you OK?

06:16.840 --> 06:20.479
I've stayed in worse places.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.559
It's all right.

06:22.560 --> 06:26.559
You can give me a hug,
I'm not going to break.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.959
Bit quiet in here, innit?

06:50.960 --> 06:54.639
People aren't willing to slap
down cash for a quickie any more.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.199
Everyone just stays home and wanks.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.319
I thought when Lillian
left me in charge

06:59.320 --> 07:01.279
it would be a chance
to do things my way.

07:01.280 --> 07:04.239
But you can't have a knocking
shop if nobody's knocking.

07:04.240 --> 07:08.239
KNOCKING

07:12.320 --> 07:13.359
Um...

07:13.360 --> 07:16.119
Piss off, son.
Come back when you're older.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.919
Woah, woah. Don't you fucking move.
How old are ya?

07:19.920 --> 07:21.839
16.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.839
You got ID?

07:29.080 --> 07:30.479
Technically, he's legal.

07:30.480 --> 07:33.079
Yeah, but if he gets
his rocks off in here,

07:33.080 --> 07:37.079
every bloody kid for miles is going
to be coming through that door...

07:38.360 --> 07:40.359
Woah, woah, woah...

07:40.360 --> 07:44.359
Park your arse.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.359
"She's young," I said.
"They make mistakes.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.959
"That's what youth is all about.
She'll learn."

07:56.960 --> 08:00.359
Main thing, she did her
time like a good girl.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.959
Makes me feel proud.
She's not half like me.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.199
CLATTERING

08:04.200 --> 08:06.639
I wasn't in jail.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.799
Best not talk about this now,
eh, Karen?

08:08.800 --> 08:11.279
I was in hospital.
A psychiatric hospital.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.999
Insanity plea. Works a charm.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.119
I've been diagnosed
as being bipolar.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.119
It's a disorder in which the
individual alternates between

08:18.120 --> 08:20.639
states of deep depression
and extreme elation.

08:20.640 --> 08:23.239
And it is nothing to be ashamed of,

08:23.240 --> 08:27.239
despite what some
people might think.

08:30.200 --> 08:33.078
You'll ruin the good
name of this family.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.318
Have you looked at
the family recently?

08:35.320 --> 08:37.719
If you really think the
Maguires have a good name

08:37.720 --> 08:41.719
maybe it's you that needs
a stay in a nuthouse.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.519
Cereal for dinner?

08:47.520 --> 08:50.039
Yeah, it's for any time of the day.

08:50.040 --> 08:54.039
Not breaking any laws.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.399
Going out?

08:55.400 --> 08:57.919
Yeah, Maxine's folks
are having a party.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.199
Well, a bit of warning
would have been nice.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.199
I've not even had a
shower or anything.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.719
It's a private party.

09:03.720 --> 09:07.519
It's not going to be fun. I've got to
pretend to be her doctor boyfriend.

09:07.520 --> 09:11.199
Boyfriend? But she does
know that you're a...

09:11.200 --> 09:12.079
Some kind of bird?

09:12.080 --> 09:12.999
Some kind of bird? Shit-stabber.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.439
Some kind of bird? Shit-stabber.
Course she does. You know that.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.439
Da-dah.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.519
Da-dah. You scrub up OK.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.159
So do you.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.959
Yeah, for a poof!

09:19.960 --> 09:22.399
Well, I'm dead busy tonight, me.

09:22.400 --> 09:26.399
Oh, I've got loads of things to do.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.879
Should we hold hands or something?

09:34.880 --> 09:38.079
I don't know. If you want.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.119
Hello?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.639
Is this not a bit over the top?

09:40.640 --> 09:43.919
Shut up!

09:43.920 --> 09:45.399
Hi, Mum.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.879
Hiya, love.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.599
Dad this is, er, my boyfriend.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.679
Hiya.

09:51.680 --> 09:52.479
Hiya. Dr Gallagher.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.679
Doctor?

09:55.680 --> 09:56.719
Can't be bad.

09:56.720 --> 10:00.719
Come in. >

10:01.160 --> 10:04.079
# Yet there's still
this appeal... #

10:04.080 --> 10:05.999
How come you ended up with our Max?

10:06.000 --> 10:09.359
We met at, um...

10:09.360 --> 10:10.959
..a social function.

10:10.960 --> 10:14.399
It must be a bit
frustrating, though.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.759
Well, no. Not really.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.759
You've obviously made something of yourself
and now you've been lumbered with her.

10:20.240 --> 10:24.239
Take her brother, Bruce.
He's directionless, but

10:24.840 --> 10:26.359
he's got drive. He's got

10:26.360 --> 10:29.239
Of course you have, sweetheart.
Don't be so sensitive.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.959
Just like her mother. You help
yourself to beer, won't you, Ian?

10:32.960 --> 10:35.159
Don't. I'm fine.

10:35.160 --> 10:39.159
Cool fucking beans. On toast. Let's just
get through this party without fucking up.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.599
Apparently, the sexual peak
for a woman is in her 30s.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.839
That's like 60 in dog years.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.039
Mickey, what you doing?

10:51.040 --> 10:52.439
Making conversation.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.119
What thefuckare you doing here?

10:54.120 --> 10:57.719
I'm looking out for you.
Watching that Maxine. She fancies you.

10:57.720 --> 10:58.759
Don't talk shite.

10:58.760 --> 10:59.799
It'll get messy.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.359
Stop trying to run my life.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.639
Stay here, don't touch anything,
don't talk to anyone.

11:04.640 --> 11:08.639
Maxine won't mind. Carl's here too.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.519
You shouldn't be here.

11:12.520 --> 11:13.719
It's a party.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.839
Not that sort of party.
You can't stay.

11:15.840 --> 11:19.839
I'm sure your boyfriend won't mind.
Could have asked me, though.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.199
Have a bit of fun! >

11:21.200 --> 11:24.359
Hey, Doc, you going to
have a go at karaoke?

11:24.360 --> 11:28.359
Max sounds like a pig being punched
when she starts belting them out.

11:28.560 --> 11:29.679
Cut it out.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.919
Cut what out?

11:30.920 --> 11:34.159
You're making Max feel bad.
I know you probably don't mean to.

11:34.160 --> 11:38.159
I don't want to cause an argument,
but you need to ease up on her.

11:38.320 --> 11:42.319
Give her a smile or a
thumbs up or something.

11:51.280 --> 11:55.279
I Got You, Babe.

12:04.080 --> 12:08.079
Oh, my God. >

12:11.560 --> 12:13.759
You've got to go
home sometime, kiddo.

12:13.760 --> 12:17.279
No. Not until they stop
treating me like a slave.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.559
Unless I'm getting in the way.

12:18.560 --> 12:22.039
Unless I'm getting in the way.
Course you're not.

12:22.040 --> 12:26.039
Right. Number 64, you're up.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.479
Thank you.

12:28.480 --> 12:32.479
Calm down. Deep breaths.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.399
Have fun.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.799
After-school specials?
You're a genius.

12:40.800 --> 12:44.199
Shame it's out of my pocket,
straight into Lillian's.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.159
Just need a bit of
creative accounting.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.079
Just need a bit of creative accounting.
Nah. Couldn't do that.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.839
Hi.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.559
I've counted it, twice.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.479
There's your ticket, take a seat.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.039
Cheers. >

12:57.040 --> 13:00.599
Then again...

13:00.600 --> 13:04.599
..what she doesn't know, right?

13:28.200 --> 13:32.199
Jamie, it's like a thousand
insects scrabbling away.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.519
Jamie, why won't he stop?

13:42.520 --> 13:46.519
Jamie, why won't he stop? Stop!

13:49.840 --> 13:52.839
Sorry. It's just...

13:52.840 --> 13:54.599
Oh, sorry.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.199
It's OK. I understand.

13:59.640 --> 14:01.519
It's just I'm tired, babes.

14:01.520 --> 14:05.519
It's all right.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.999
So you really like our Max, eh?

14:15.000 --> 14:18.999
Yeah, she's great.

14:22.240 --> 14:26.239
You're a shit liar.

14:26.400 --> 14:30.399
Little gayboy.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.199
Cut it out, Bruce.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.239
It's OK. He knows.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.159
I tell my little
brother everything.

14:38.160 --> 14:41.039
Fuck's sake. I thought you
were going to punch me, then.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.319
Yeah. With his penis.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.999
You're kidding. Are you...?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.479
One of the gays. Yep. For me sins.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.519
One of the gays. Yep. For me sins.
I'm one of them lot too.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.879
You got any friends who don't
park their car up Chocolate Lane?

14:50.880 --> 14:51.679
I don't.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.479
I don't. Yeah, that's a shame.

14:54.480 --> 14:58.479
Right, you boys can all crash in here,
but don't expect any Caligula-style orgies.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.959
Smoking dope's one thing,
but I don't think Pops would be pleased

15:02.960 --> 15:05.119
if he found us with
us dicks hanging out.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.279
And cheers for
sticking up for my sis.

15:08.280 --> 15:12.279
If you were shafting her, I'd
definitely give you my seal of approval.

15:13.840 --> 15:17.319
I'll get some pillows
and stuff, then. >

15:17.320 --> 15:21.319
I was thinking,
I could stay in your room.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.959
I mean, give the lads a
bit of space and all that.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.679
Yeah, its just...

15:25.680 --> 15:28.199
Ian's my fake boyfriend, so...

15:28.200 --> 15:30.919
My dad, you know. Might be weird.

15:30.920 --> 15:31.959
Yeah, good point.

15:31.960 --> 15:35.679
Er, your singing -
it were dead good.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.159
Like proper singing.

15:38.160 --> 15:42.159
Aw. Cheers.

16:09.880 --> 16:13.879
'I'm looking out for you.
Watching that Maxine. She fancies you.'

16:35.000 --> 16:37.639
Cheers for last night.
I do appreciate it.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.399
That's my mug.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.439
What?

16:40.440 --> 16:44.439
It says "Ian" on it. Ian. That's me.
So, respect that, thank you.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.959
What's his problem?

16:52.960 --> 16:55.079
You've put the wind up him.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.159
Sorry?

16:56.160 --> 16:57.239
He knows.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.439
Knows what?

16:58.440 --> 17:01.119
That you fancy him.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.439
I don't.

17:02.440 --> 17:06.439
Whatever you thinks going to happen,
it's not. Right? I'm sorry, but it's not.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.919
You need a fucking hobby, sunshine.

17:09.920 --> 17:13.919
Too much time on your hands.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.479
Friendly warning letter.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.839
Official warning letter.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.279
Red no-more-fucking-warning
letters.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.279
Easy, Karen easy.

17:42.280 --> 17:44.559
Come on, calm down.

17:44.560 --> 17:48.559
You think I'm doing this cos of
my condition? Crazy fucking Karen?

17:49.040 --> 17:51.719
We are one bill away from
being out on our arses.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.719
Hey, it's all under control.

17:53.720 --> 17:56.759
I'm dealing with these.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.719
You've got nothing to worry about.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.519
You promise me?

18:00.520 --> 18:01.759
Yeah.

18:01.760 --> 18:05.759
Course.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.119
Voila.

18:27.120 --> 18:31.119
Tidy bit of artwork by
yours fucking truly.

18:38.080 --> 18:42.079
Oi. What the fuck?

18:51.720 --> 18:53.159
You all right?

18:53.160 --> 18:57.159
Don't speak, all right?
Don't say a word.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.879
Ah,yeah. Ah.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.879
Oh! Ah!

19:16.800 --> 19:17.959
'Watching that Maxine.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.959
'Cos whatever you think's
going to happen, it's not.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.279
'She fancies you.

19:22.280 --> 19:26.279
'He knows that you fancy him.'

19:30.640 --> 19:32.279
I've got to run.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.039
Right, well, see you later, yeah?

19:34.040 --> 19:38.039
Yeah.

19:45.880 --> 19:49.879
Have you seen the scissors?

20:00.960 --> 20:02.279
Give us a kiss.

20:02.280 --> 20:06.279
Fuck off, Mickey.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.479
It's back on. It's so back on.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.679
You should have seen
her all over me.

20:20.680 --> 20:24.679
We get it, mate.
You're great, you're amazing.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.999
Right, I'm off. >

20:28.000 --> 20:29.839
You're joking. You can't go home.

20:29.840 --> 20:33.519
Are you not seeing what I'm seeing?

20:33.520 --> 20:35.159
They're all right, I suppose.

20:35.160 --> 20:39.159
All right? It's girls in school uniform.
There's no way we are not going home with
them.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.679
Nah. I can't. It wouldn't be right.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.959
No, it really would be.

20:50.960 --> 20:54.679
There's two of them and one of you,
and they're all gagging for it. >

20:54.680 --> 20:58.679
So stop being a tit
and get over there.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.519
Happy birthday.

21:00.520 --> 21:04.519
See you later, mate. Take care.

21:06.240 --> 21:09.239
Ladies toilets. Two minutes.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.439
You what?

21:10.440 --> 21:14.439
You heard.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.679
Do I know you?

21:21.680 --> 21:23.599
No.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.159
So what's this about, then?

21:25.160 --> 21:27.679
I just wanted to see what
sort of person you are.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.479
Like, are you the sort of man

21:29.480 --> 21:33.479
who walks into the ladies just
because a stranger told him to?

21:33.520 --> 21:37.519
And?

22:06.400 --> 22:10.159
I was going to knock
this time, honest.

22:10.160 --> 22:14.159
Oh, come on. It was sort of funny.

22:15.440 --> 22:18.439
Have you been eating twat
sandwiches today or something?

22:18.440 --> 22:22.439
Because either I've done something wrong
or you've turned into a total fanny

22:24.320 --> 22:27.239
Mickey thinks you fancy me.

22:27.240 --> 22:30.999
He keeps going on about it.
It's messing with my head a bit.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.599
Sorry.

22:34.600 --> 22:38.439
I don't think you need
to worry about that.

22:38.440 --> 22:42.439
Even if I did - be pointless.

22:44.120 --> 22:48.119
So don't flatter yourself.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.399
It's not just that.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.999
It's...

22:53.000 --> 22:56.999
I don't know.

22:57.520 --> 22:58.559
What are you doing?

22:58.560 --> 23:00.279
I don't know.

23:00.280 --> 23:02.839
Don't do that. Don't.

23:02.840 --> 23:03.879
Sorry.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.519
I know you're just
trying to be nice,

23:06.520 --> 23:09.999
but I fucking hate nice and
I don't need your sympathy.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.599
It's not sympathy.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.079
Ian, a few hours ago,
you had your dick in Mickey.

23:14.080 --> 23:15.839
So let's not pretend otherwise.

23:15.840 --> 23:18.919
I did it because I
thought it'd help.

23:18.920 --> 23:22.719
You don't have to justify it.

23:22.720 --> 23:25.159
That's what you do. >

23:25.160 --> 23:29.159
Who you are. >

23:29.600 --> 23:30.639
Sorry.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.559
All right?

23:32.560 --> 23:36.559
Piss off.

23:46.400 --> 23:50.399
Stop, right.

23:51.680 --> 23:55.679
Stop.

24:02.120 --> 24:06.119
GROANING

24:42.360 --> 24:44.519
Please tell me you weren't
watching me sleep.

24:44.520 --> 24:47.999
We're gonna watch a movie.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.799
It's a bit early for porn,
isn't it?

24:49.800 --> 24:52.039
It's not porn. It's art.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.719
Oh, really. What's it called?

24:53.720 --> 24:57.719
Handbugger Hill. Part Two.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.199
That is Richie Rockwood.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.999
Ten inches of pure hard steel.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.759
He won the Gay Adult Video Awards,

25:06.760 --> 25:09.639
Best Performer,
three years in a row.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.679
He's gorgeous, isn't he?

25:11.680 --> 25:13.479
He's all right I guess.

25:13.480 --> 25:17.279
No, he is not 'all right'.
A cup of tea in the morning is 'all right'.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.919
Beans on toast is 'all right'.

25:18.920 --> 25:21.719
Richie Rockwood is fucking
incredible and I want you to admit

25:21.720 --> 25:24.719
that to me, right here, right now.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.719
You saw us.

25:32.720 --> 25:35.559
You're too fucking right I did.
Ruined me dinner.

25:35.560 --> 25:38.799
I know this must be confusing for
you it's confusing for me too.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.839
Really fucking confusing.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.079
Hey, don't worry.

25:43.080 --> 25:45.199
We're going to sort you out.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.439
We'll de-straighten you.

25:47.440 --> 25:50.199
Everything will be fine.
Ian, just watch the movie!

25:50.200 --> 25:51.879
I don't want to watch
the fucking movie!

25:51.880 --> 25:53.719
Fine. We'll go to bed then.No!

25:53.720 --> 25:55.079
You didn't have a problem yesterday.
Before she fucked with your head.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.719
She didn't fuck with my head...

25:56.720 --> 25:58.359
So I'm just a piece
of meat to you am I?

25:58.360 --> 26:01.479
A booty call.

26:01.980 --> 26:05.059
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have dragged you into this.

26:06.060 --> 26:07.739
I shouldn't have slept with you.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.979
Yes, you should Ian!

26:09.980 --> 26:12.139
Because I'm a fucking man!

26:12.140 --> 26:16.139
And that is fucking natural!

26:17.740 --> 26:19.219
I'm not handling knock offs.

26:19.220 --> 26:21.099
They're not knock off.
They're 100% legit.

26:21.100 --> 26:22.499
Where did you get them from then?

26:22.500 --> 26:24.539
I won them.

26:24.540 --> 26:27.299
In a raffle. Youth club.

26:27.300 --> 26:31.299
The youth club was
raffling off ladyshaves?

26:31.660 --> 26:32.859
Fifty quid.

26:32.860 --> 26:36.859
Done!

26:40.780 --> 26:44.779
Liam. Breakfast.

26:45.380 --> 26:47.819
Carl? Stella?

26:47.820 --> 26:49.339
Anyone?

26:49.340 --> 26:53.339
Hello?

26:55.620 --> 26:57.419
All right. On you go.

26:57.420 --> 26:59.659
Don't forget your souvenir snaps.

26:59.660 --> 27:02.499
Only two quid.

27:02.500 --> 27:06.499
Look, come home son this is no place
for a young lad. Aw, fuckin'ell.

27:07.580 --> 27:10.699
You only want me home because
you can't look after yourself.

27:10.700 --> 27:12.419
Well, yeah. Obviously.

27:12.420 --> 27:16.419
But, your part of me,
you're me flesh and blood.

27:16.500 --> 27:20.499
I'm like one of those amputees who just
lost a limb and still thinks that it's
there.

27:21.580 --> 27:22.819
Twenty quid.

27:22.820 --> 27:26.819
It's not about the cash,
Liam - it's about family.

27:27.460 --> 27:29.099
Twenty. Quid.

27:29.100 --> 27:30.859
I could get a maid for that.

27:30.860 --> 27:32.459
A butler. Me own personal Jeeves.

27:32.460 --> 27:34.419
Then get one.

27:34.420 --> 27:37.099
Just...

27:37.100 --> 27:40.019
you what, you what? Eh, eh?

27:40.020 --> 27:42.299
Fucking tried, didn't I?

27:42.300 --> 27:46.299
Me own fucking flesh and blood.

27:54.540 --> 27:57.579
I think you must have
wandered into the wrong house.

27:57.580 --> 28:01.579
Cause everybody knows Paddy
Maguire wouldn't pay for it.

28:03.820 --> 28:06.779
I just thought as two
fellow entrepreneurs,

28:06.780 --> 28:09.619
we could have a little chat
a business opportunity.

28:09.620 --> 28:12.219
We're doing fine as we are.

28:12.220 --> 28:13.699
You haven't even heard my proposal.

28:13.700 --> 28:15.379
That's right.

28:15.380 --> 28:17.419
I haven't.

28:17.420 --> 28:21.419
Goodbye, Paddy.

28:24.180 --> 28:28.179
Try and control your woman, son.

28:28.900 --> 28:32.899
Before someone else has to.

29:03.900 --> 29:05.819
Whatever your game is,
I'm not interested.

29:05.820 --> 29:08.499
Jamie...it is Jamie, right?

29:08.500 --> 29:10.059
Sit down.

29:10.060 --> 29:14.059
Now there's a woman in
Manchester on a conference.

29:16.020 --> 29:20.019
Three months ago she discovered that
her husband had been having an affair

29:20.100 --> 29:21.819
for over two years.

29:21.820 --> 29:24.379
She's vulnerable, a little insecure

29:24.380 --> 29:27.699
but, most importantly,
she needs cheering up

29:27.700 --> 29:31.699
and someone like you could really
put the smile back on her face.

29:31.860 --> 29:33.579
You've gotta be kidding, yeah?

29:33.580 --> 29:35.939
I put two hundred in your pocket.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.819
Missing fifty here.

29:37.820 --> 29:39.619
I had bills to pay.

29:39.620 --> 29:41.219
Times are hard. I get it.

29:41.220 --> 29:42.779
That's why I'm offering you work.

29:42.780 --> 29:45.339
I said I had bills.

29:45.340 --> 29:48.139
I didn't say I wanting to
become a fucking man whore.

29:48.140 --> 29:50.659
You still took fifty quid
off me to pay some bills.

29:50.660 --> 29:54.099
But it won't be enough, will it?
Because there's always another brown

29:54.100 --> 29:56.259
envelope waiting to
land on the doormat.

29:56.260 --> 30:00.259
One hour's work. And you get this.

30:00.740 --> 30:02.699
No. I'm not interested.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.539
You are going to
walk away from this?

30:05.540 --> 30:09.019
I've got a wife and a kid. So yeah.

30:09.020 --> 30:13.019
I am.

30:17.260 --> 30:21.259
Think about it.

30:25.380 --> 30:29.379
Hey I can guarantee you at least
two hundred quid a session, right?

30:29.380 --> 30:31.779
Well, that's three sessions a week,

30:31.780 --> 30:35.779
that's nearly two and a half
grand a month right. Tax free.

30:36.140 --> 30:37.659
Yes. You have a wife. And a kid.

30:37.660 --> 30:41.379
But that kind of money's got to
make life a lot easier for everyone.

30:41.380 --> 30:45.379
If you want to know more...
get in the car.

30:50.860 --> 30:54.019
It's through the back gents,
game kicks off in five minutes.

30:54.020 --> 30:58.019
It's a hundred quid minimum, and time
wasters, you know where the exit is.

31:07.540 --> 31:09.059
No.

31:09.060 --> 31:10.299
What?

31:10.300 --> 31:14.299
I can't do it, Joe. One thing I've
learned is life has got to be simple.

31:15.020 --> 31:16.419
It is.

31:16.420 --> 31:19.699
You, me, and the baby.
We get in the car and we go.

31:19.700 --> 31:22.899
Right now.

31:22.900 --> 31:25.179
Heard you got tagged.

31:25.180 --> 31:29.139
That was a misunderstanding
at the casino.

31:29.140 --> 31:31.139
It's a ten minute detour to a mate.

31:31.140 --> 31:35.139
It's a blow-torch and wire cutters moment.
It's not a reason to stay.

31:36.020 --> 31:38.579
Jamie can't look after ya.

31:38.580 --> 31:40.859
He can't provide for you.
Not like I can.

31:40.860 --> 31:41.779
He does his best.

31:41.780 --> 31:45.779
And it's never going
to be good enough!

31:47.380 --> 31:49.099
I just came here

31:49.100 --> 31:52.099
to say no.

31:52.100 --> 31:56.099
That was it.

32:01.980 --> 32:05.979
Really fuckin' smooth, Joe.

32:06.540 --> 32:10.539
KNOCK ON DOOR

32:11.500 --> 32:13.019
Carl. Hey.

32:13.020 --> 32:14.779
Sshhh. Come.

32:14.780 --> 32:17.099
Come on,

32:17.100 --> 32:18.739
sit down.

32:18.740 --> 32:20.019
Close your eyes.

32:20.020 --> 32:24.019
Come on, close them.

32:26.460 --> 32:29.339
OK.

32:29.340 --> 32:31.139
What's this?

32:31.140 --> 32:35.139
Open it and see.

32:36.100 --> 32:37.859
Jesus.

32:37.860 --> 32:41.099
It's real.

32:41.100 --> 32:43.819
Carl... You haven't
thought this through.

32:43.820 --> 32:45.739
I have. Really.

32:45.740 --> 32:49.659
Look we've been stupid and
we've made mistakes...

32:49.660 --> 32:52.939
but I'm certain about this, Max.

32:52.940 --> 32:56.339
I really am. You and me.

32:56.340 --> 32:59.259
Whoa! You've got terrible timing you.
I'm running late for work.

32:59.260 --> 33:01.579
Five minutes.

33:01.580 --> 33:04.579
I'm already on a warning.
They're gonna kill me -

33:04.580 --> 33:08.579
last chance, they said.

33:10.020 --> 33:13.219
Go on then. You better run.
I'll come see you after.

33:13.220 --> 33:17.219
Yeah.

33:21.100 --> 33:21.499
Guess what?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.099
Guess what? What?

33:23.100 --> 33:27.099
I'm getting married.

33:39.500 --> 33:43.259
DOOR OPENS

33:43.260 --> 33:47.259
Come in

33:51.820 --> 33:53.659
Not going to give you
much of a night out.

33:53.660 --> 33:54.699
What do you want?

33:54.700 --> 33:55.739
Assistance.

33:55.740 --> 33:57.739
And what makes you
think I'll say yes?

33:57.740 --> 34:01.739
Because you want to be in full
possession of your knee caps.

34:01.740 --> 34:05.739
And I'll be forever in your debt.

34:06.060 --> 34:10.059
Who knows, maybe it will mend a few
bridges between me and your ma.

34:10.780 --> 34:13.899
Is this something like being
made an offer you can't refuse?

34:13.900 --> 34:17.899
No. It's exactly like being
made an offer you can't refuse.

35:18.060 --> 35:20.219
Over a thousand quid in two days.

35:20.220 --> 35:21.979
God, if Lillian wasn't
coming back tomorrow...

35:21.980 --> 35:23.259
God, if Lillian wasn't coming
back tomorrow... I know.

35:23.260 --> 35:27.259
I mean, the best thing is,
we did this.

35:27.260 --> 35:31.259
Thought they'd all
buggered off home.

35:39.740 --> 35:42.299
What the fuck are you doing?

35:42.300 --> 35:46.299
Out! Everyone out!

35:46.740 --> 35:48.299
I'm sorry.

35:48.300 --> 35:50.899
Fuck being sorry.
What the hell is wrong with you?

35:50.900 --> 35:52.539
It's only coke.

35:52.540 --> 35:56.539
And since when have you been a
fucking coke dealer, Chesney?

35:59.380 --> 36:03.379
You're working for him.

36:05.580 --> 36:08.139
OK. You can piss off now.

36:08.140 --> 36:10.379
Uh-uh. We're keeping the coke.
And the money.

36:10.380 --> 36:11.579
He'll fucking kill me.

36:11.580 --> 36:13.379
I'll handle him.

36:13.380 --> 36:17.379
I didn't have a choice.

36:18.740 --> 36:19.899
So she said yeah then?

36:19.900 --> 36:22.139
She's going to. I can tell.

36:22.140 --> 36:24.379
See I know Maxine.

36:24.380 --> 36:25.659
No, you don't.

36:25.660 --> 36:28.179
What do you mean?

36:28.180 --> 36:32.179
You don't know Maxine at all.
You don't know anything.

36:33.980 --> 36:35.299
Ian's sleeping with her.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.139
What?

36:37.140 --> 36:38.259
Shut up.

36:38.260 --> 36:39.699
I caught 'em.

36:39.700 --> 36:42.539
I'm sure you did. Ian and Maxine.

36:42.540 --> 36:45.379
I came home and they were fucking.
They didn't see me.

36:45.380 --> 36:47.459
Look, Ian's gay. And you're insane.

36:47.460 --> 36:49.259
Think about it.

36:49.260 --> 36:51.059
All that time they spend together.

36:51.060 --> 36:53.619
Laughing and joking. Best mates.

36:53.620 --> 36:56.779
More than best mates.

36:56.780 --> 36:58.939
You've seen it too.

36:58.940 --> 37:00.219
Micky...

37:00.220 --> 37:02.419
you're starting to piss me off now.

37:02.420 --> 37:05.339
Ask him then. Ask him about it.

37:05.340 --> 37:07.659
Why would I lie to you,
for fuck's sake? >

37:07.660 --> 37:09.859
I'm trying to stop you
making a fool of yourself! >

37:09.860 --> 37:10.899
I'm trying to stop you making a
fool of yourself! > Fuck off!

37:10.900 --> 37:14.539
In his bed. I saw them.
Fucking each other.

37:14.540 --> 37:16.459
Look, I'm telling you
this to help you.

37:16.460 --> 37:18.859
Why are you trying to
mess with me like this?

37:18.860 --> 37:21.379
Tell me it's a lie! Tell me!

37:21.380 --> 37:23.459
I can't!

37:23.460 --> 37:25.299
It's not!

37:25.300 --> 37:27.059
Ian and Maxine?

37:27.060 --> 37:29.979
My Maxine?

37:29.980 --> 37:32.059
No...

37:32.060 --> 37:35.299
That's not fucking...
that's not fucking possible.

37:35.300 --> 37:37.099
She wouldn't.

37:37.100 --> 37:38.699
She wants to be with me.

37:38.700 --> 37:42.259
She got up and walked out on you,
the moment you pulled out that ring.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.739
Has she called you about it?

37:43.740 --> 37:45.139
Texted you?

37:45.140 --> 37:48.619
Anything? No.

37:48.620 --> 37:50.579
Because she's fucking your brother.

37:50.580 --> 37:52.619
Fuck you!

37:52.620 --> 37:55.139
That's not true!

37:55.140 --> 37:59.139
It's not fucking true!

38:30.780 --> 38:34.779
Why the fuck did you tell Carl?!

38:36.580 --> 38:37.939
Because he loves her.

38:37.940 --> 38:40.539
No, no, he doesn't!
He just thinks he does!

38:40.540 --> 38:42.179
He proposed to her!

38:42.180 --> 38:42.699
What?

38:42.700 --> 38:46.179
And he was gonna ask you
to be the best man. You!

38:46.180 --> 38:48.779
Oh, no, this can't be happening!

38:48.780 --> 38:51.819
Just explain to him that
it was all an accident.

38:51.820 --> 38:55.499
How can I explain it to him when I
don't even understand it myself?

38:55.500 --> 38:56.859
Well, the damage is done.

38:56.860 --> 38:59.419
So you better put a stop to the
whole thing. Its for the best.

38:59.420 --> 39:00.779
No.

39:00.780 --> 39:03.579
But you can't like her.

39:03.580 --> 39:06.739
She doesn't... she
doesn't even have a cock.

39:06.740 --> 39:08.379
Maybe I just like people.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.619
People with cocks.

39:09.620 --> 39:13.619
Well, maybe I am confused and maybe
me and Maxine are just mates...

39:13.620 --> 39:15.779
or maybe it's more than that.

39:15.780 --> 39:16.779
How can it be?!

39:16.780 --> 39:20.779
How can it be?! I don't know!
I don't have all the fucking answers!

39:21.220 --> 39:22.739
I just know...

39:22.740 --> 39:26.059
that when I'm with her,
I'm not thinking man or woman...

39:26.060 --> 39:28.259
it's just...Maxine.

39:28.260 --> 39:32.059
Maybe sexuality isn't one thing
or another maybe it's something

39:32.060 --> 39:33.659
that's just shifting and moving.

39:33.660 --> 39:34.819
that's just shifting
and moving. Fuck you!

39:34.820 --> 39:38.179
What?!

39:38.180 --> 39:41.419
What?

39:41.420 --> 39:44.419
Fuck...you!

39:44.420 --> 39:46.019
I looked up to you.

39:46.020 --> 39:49.259
I thought you meant something.

39:49.260 --> 39:52.379
Because until I met you...

39:52.380 --> 39:54.299
I was a freak.

39:54.300 --> 39:57.899
I was disgusted with myself.

39:57.900 --> 40:01.899
But you showed me that
I didn't have to be.

40:06.140 --> 40:08.139
You're a fucking traitor.

40:08.140 --> 40:10.379
It wasn't...

40:10.380 --> 40:12.899
It wasn't personal.
I didn't mean to.

40:12.900 --> 40:16.139
But you did. And I loved you.

40:16.140 --> 40:20.139
And not in a "want to shag
you all over the place" way.

40:20.780 --> 40:23.539
But just love!

40:23.540 --> 40:27.539
Just proper fucking love!

40:29.660 --> 40:33.659
for what you are.

40:35.180 --> 40:39.179
A cunt.

40:54.420 --> 40:56.579
I understand you have
something that belongs to me.

40:56.580 --> 40:57.819
I understand you have something that
belongs to me. We're having dinner here.

40:57.820 --> 41:01.819
Chips? I've only had
four of my five a day.

41:02.580 --> 41:06.579
Have a bloody banana then.

41:11.100 --> 41:15.099
You had no right dealing at Lillian's.
And to school kids.

41:15.180 --> 41:16.899
Free market. Supply and demand.

41:16.900 --> 41:19.459
Exactly the same as you were doing.

41:19.460 --> 41:21.179
No. I just wanted them to have fun.

41:21.180 --> 41:24.339
Harmless fun,
show them a good time.

41:24.340 --> 41:26.299
No, you wanted to
make some easy cash.

41:26.300 --> 41:27.379
At least I wasn't lying to myself.

41:27.380 --> 41:30.179
At least I wasn't lying to myself.
You don't have any bloody bananas.

41:30.180 --> 41:32.739
Then have some milk or something!

41:32.740 --> 41:35.899
Milk?

41:35.900 --> 41:39.899
Jesus!

41:41.980 --> 41:45.139
Don't you dare act like
you're better than me.

41:45.140 --> 41:48.299
You're the one who paid to
fuck your own son's girlfriend.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.339
And you're the one
who took the money.

41:50.340 --> 41:54.339
Now, I would like my
property back, thank you.

42:07.860 --> 42:10.299
True what they say, dear.

42:10.300 --> 42:14.299
If you look in the abyss long enough
it'll stare right back at you.

42:23.300 --> 42:25.139
Don't ask.

42:25.140 --> 42:28.019
I'm having a bit of tough
time of it at the moment.

42:28.020 --> 42:29.459
I haven't got any money.

42:29.460 --> 42:31.019
I don't want any money.

42:31.020 --> 42:34.059
I wouldn't ask you anyway.

42:34.060 --> 42:36.939
Oh.

42:36.940 --> 42:38.699
I just...

42:38.700 --> 42:40.299
I dunno.

42:40.300 --> 42:43.299
Do you ever think you're one thing,

42:43.300 --> 42:46.819
and then you breathe in,
and maybe you're not?

42:46.820 --> 42:49.939
I went to Southend-On-Sea once.

42:49.940 --> 42:52.259
The sixth circle of Hell.

42:52.260 --> 42:55.939
And I stood on the beach,
resisting the urge to do a Reggie Perrin,

42:55.940 --> 42:58.139
and there's this old fella,

42:58.140 --> 43:01.899
just eating custard creams.

43:01.900 --> 43:05.419
Just shoving them down his throat.

43:05.420 --> 43:09.419
And he looked miserable.

43:10.740 --> 43:13.499
Even though he'd probably
bought 'em all for himself.

43:13.500 --> 43:17.499
He looked so fucking miserable.

43:17.500 --> 43:19.899
Not sure I follow.

43:19.900 --> 43:22.259
Me neither.

43:22.260 --> 43:26.259
S'all fucking bits and pieces,
this life of ours.

43:29.580 --> 43:31.659
Could be worse.

43:31.660 --> 43:35.659
Could be a poof.

44:01.100 --> 44:05.099
So. Maxine then.

44:09.740 --> 44:13.739
You fucking...!

44:30.780 --> 44:32.619
You fucking knew!

44:32.620 --> 44:33.899
Hey!

44:33.900 --> 44:35.139
I'll fucking kill him!

44:35.140 --> 44:38.579
Stop it! He's your brother! >

44:38.580 --> 44:40.259
He's fucking dead to me!

44:40.260 --> 44:41.819
Get him out!

44:41.820 --> 44:43.299
Fucking hell.

44:43.300 --> 44:47.299
Fucking hell, you all right son?

44:56.060 --> 44:58.419
Ian, I'm...

44:58.420 --> 44:59.339
Don't say sorry.

44:59.340 --> 45:01.379
Don't say sorry. But I am.

45:01.380 --> 45:04.939
I'm sorry.

45:04.940 --> 45:08.939
I'm not.

45:14.300 --> 45:17.659
'That's the thing about
this world of ours.

45:17.660 --> 45:19.339
'Even if we are twats,

45:19.340 --> 45:22.739
'it just keeps on rolling.

45:22.740 --> 45:24.139
'Wife walks out on ya.

45:24.140 --> 45:26.419
'Father passes away.

45:26.420 --> 45:28.779
'Cat gets run over
by the number 10 bus.

45:28.780 --> 45:30.579
'Doesn't matter.

45:30.580 --> 45:34.579
'World's not going to stop,
not even going to pause for breath.'

45:36.820 --> 45:40.819
MOBILE RINGS

45:47.780 --> 45:50.619
I've got to pop out for a while.

45:50.620 --> 45:54.139
Sure.

45:54.140 --> 45:56.499
'Nobody cares about your problems.

45:56.500 --> 45:59.419
'But sometimes you find someone...

45:59.420 --> 46:01.779
'someone who seems to understand...

46:01.780 --> 46:05.779
'someone who gets you.

46:08.820 --> 46:10.939
'And for a little while,
it's better.

46:10.940 --> 46:14.139
'We can lie there in the dark and
promise never to leave each other.

46:14.140 --> 46:18.139
'We have someone to hold onto.

46:21.820 --> 46:25.819
'For a little while anyway.'

46:29.900 --> 46:33.259
I've met someone. We're gonna
live together. Her name's Doreen.

46:33.260 --> 46:34.219
Oh, my God!

46:34.220 --> 46:35.179
What happened to the kitchen?

46:35.180 --> 46:36.299
Bailiffs.

46:36.300 --> 46:37.739
Neverlet the bailiffs in!

46:37.740 --> 46:39.659
Can you lend me some more money?

46:39.660 --> 46:41.419
This is it for the Maguires.

46:41.420 --> 46:42.459
150 grand!

46:42.460 --> 46:44.499
And you're going to rob it.

46:44.500 --> 46:44.979
How much do you owe?

46:44.980 --> 46:47.019
How much do you owe?
Fifteen hundred.

46:47.020 --> 46:48.219
Get down, son!

46:48.220 --> 46:49.739
Why should I?
What have I got to live for?

46:49.740 --> 46:50.899
Noooooo!

46:50.900 --> 46:54.779
Hello, officers, what seems
to be the problem? I know you.

46:54.780 --> 46:55.979
None of this was done
to make you jealous.

46:55.980 --> 46:58.259
It's your mid-life crisis,
not mine.

46:58.260 --> 47:02.259
I want us to go to Cuba.

47:02.260 --> 47:12.260

47:51.540 --> 47:55.539
Ah, bastard!

47:56.180 --> 48:00.179
I'm not gonna ask.
