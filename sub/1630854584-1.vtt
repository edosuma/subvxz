[siren whoops]

02:44.686 --> 02:47.732
[radio chatter]

02:57.960 --> 02:59.004
Jake.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.093
Dutch.

03:01.137 --> 03:03.270
Hey, you'’re not gonna
like this one, Jake.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.662
Trust me.

03:05.533 --> 03:08.013
[radio chatter]

03:22.245 --> 03:25.248
[jingling]

03:45.399 --> 03:47.009
[Jake]
Don'’t examine the body

03:47.052 --> 03:50.142
until a lead investigator
is present.

03:51.231 --> 03:55.017
Understood. But you'’re
half an hour late.

03:58.194 --> 04:00.283
[jingling]

04:00.327 --> 04:03.243
The priest said that he'’d
never seen this woman
in the church before.

04:06.028 --> 04:09.031
Just because he'’s a priest
don'’t mean he can't lie, Mary.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.524
Sage.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.482
Jake!

04:26.353 --> 04:27.354
Wait here.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.535
I already spoke
with Dr. Loesch.

04:34.578 --> 04:37.146
The Artist is right
where he should be.

04:37.189 --> 04:40.367
Just wait till CSI
finish this report.

04:40.410 --> 04:43.718
Can'’t start jumping
into conclusions here.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.080
What were you guys
talking about?

05:00.735 --> 05:02.998
Just some old demons.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.137
[sirens wailing]

05:21.277 --> 05:22.757
[door opens]

05:22.800 --> 05:25.847
St. Joseph'’s
called again today.

05:29.459 --> 05:33.115
The doctors are
giving him one week,
maybe two at the most.

05:34.116 --> 05:35.465
You should go see him.

05:37.119 --> 05:39.817
-I can'’t handle that.
-Mary, this is your dad.

05:39.861 --> 05:42.167
Can we please just
not talk about this?

05:49.044 --> 05:51.481
[recording]
Before the biblical God
created the world,

05:51.525 --> 05:54.092
he first created the heavens.

05:54.136 --> 05:57.226
And inside the heavens,
he created the cherubim,

05:57.269 --> 05:59.315
the angels and the archangels.

05:59.359 --> 06:03.145
The archangels were essentially
the highest rank of angels

06:03.188 --> 06:05.756
and the chief messengers
of God himself.

06:05.800 --> 06:11.371
Among those archangels
was a being known as Lucifer.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.987
[sheriff] Both women
were coated in
a resinous substance.

06:19.030 --> 06:23.295
The lab confirmed
it'’s the same compound
used on previous victims.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.601
Previous victims?

06:24.645 --> 06:26.255
I think it'’s pretty safe
to assume

06:26.298 --> 06:28.866
-we have a copycat
on our hands here, folks.
-Sir?

06:28.910 --> 06:31.434
One with a rather
intimate knowledge
of his predecessor.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.610
-Uh, excuse me, Sheriff?
-Yes, Detective Kelly.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.221
I didn'’t realize that
there were other murders
connected to this case.

06:36.265 --> 06:38.354
I assumed Jake filled you in.

06:39.268 --> 06:40.835
It must'’ve slipped his mind.

06:40.878 --> 06:43.403
Okay, here'’s
the Cliff'’s Notes version.

06:43.446 --> 06:46.971
Five years ago,
serial killer Arnaud Lefeuvre,

06:47.015 --> 06:51.149
aka "The Artist,"
abducted and murdered six women.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.064
Prostitutes, sex workers.

06:54.892 --> 06:59.114
First, he poisoned
and preserved them using a ricin
extracted from castor beans.

06:59.157 --> 07:02.509
Then he'’d arrange
and decorate the corpses

07:02.552 --> 07:05.207
in lifelike poses
using metal frames,

07:05.250 --> 07:08.776
leaving them to be found in
various places around the city.

07:08.819 --> 07:12.214
He called them
his "masterpieces."

07:12.257 --> 07:14.477
I do actually remember that.
It was before finals,

07:14.521 --> 07:16.131
so the details
are a little fuzzy.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.263
How did you guys
end up catching him?

07:18.307 --> 07:20.614
Damn fine detective work
is how.

07:22.267 --> 07:25.488
Done by damn fine detectives,
one of whom is sitting
right beside you.

09:08.722 --> 09:09.766
[siren whoops]

09:10.680 --> 09:11.942
[sighs]

09:11.986 --> 09:14.728
[helicopter whirring]

09:14.771 --> 09:17.295
Hey. You might want to ease up
on the caffeine there.

09:17.339 --> 09:18.819
It'’s the only thing
keeping me vertical.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.822
Sleep hasn'’t been
very restful for me lately.

09:21.865 --> 09:25.652
Ah.A railroad worker
found her about an hour ago.

09:25.695 --> 09:28.872
[radio chatter]

09:28.916 --> 09:31.440
[officer] Need to get some
photographs around here.

09:31.483 --> 09:32.746
[Jake sighs]

09:54.550 --> 09:57.771
[sheriff] The city is still
trying to recover from
what happened five years ago.

09:57.814 --> 10:02.253
Last thing we need
is some damn copycat
reenacting this nightmare.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.647
Well, you'’re preaching
to the choir, sir.

10:04.691 --> 10:09.652
Yeah. That'’s why I'm
considering every option.

10:09.696 --> 10:13.438
-No way. Absolutely not.
-Think objectively here, Jake.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.223
He'’s our best chance,
and you know it.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.965
-Nobody would do this, sir.
-Dutch has already volunteered.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.663
-Dutch?
-Okay, sorry. Vo--
Volunteered for what?

10:22.012 --> 10:23.448
The Artist.

10:24.798 --> 10:28.192
He wants to send Dutch
in there to see The Artist.

10:29.541 --> 10:33.154
Oh, well, that'’s a bold move,
um, but worth a shot.

10:33.197 --> 10:35.199
I think that if you
appeal to his ego,

10:35.243 --> 10:38.463
he would resent the fact
that another lesser artist
is copying his work.

10:39.595 --> 10:43.207
But I think Dutch
needs some finesse.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.689
I would send someone else.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.126
Who do you have in mind,
Detective?

10:50.519 --> 10:53.565
Um, you'’re looking at her.

10:53.609 --> 10:56.307
My background is
in psychology, so...

10:56.351 --> 10:58.135
I'’ve read your file, Mary.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.791
Then what do you say?
You won'’t regret this.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.229
Sir, she'’s not ready for this.

11:05.273 --> 11:08.189
You know what?
I'’m actually very capable
of making my own decisions.

11:08.232 --> 11:09.669
Thank you.
I won'’t let you down.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.546
I'’ll call Dr. Loesch,
set it up this afternoon.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.417
Thank you.

11:25.989 --> 11:28.165
I still deserve to be here,
you know.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.559
So don'’t even think about
monopolizing the conversation.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.126
I get to ask
some of the questions.

11:32.169 --> 11:35.999
All of them actually.
I'’m not going in with you.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.435
What do you mean?

11:37.479 --> 11:39.655
Well, The Artist is
only going to play ball

11:39.699 --> 11:41.918
if we could somehow
win his trust.

11:41.962 --> 11:46.880
That would be impossible
with me in the room,
considering our history.

11:46.923 --> 11:49.883
You mean what?
Other than the arrest? Or...

11:49.926 --> 11:54.191
People will remember The Artist
for the way he murdered
and preserved six women.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.716
But he actually took
seven lives.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.630
What are you talking about?

12:03.157 --> 12:07.204
Zeke Anderson.
My partner of 15 years.

12:07.248 --> 12:09.511
And a good friend.

12:09.554 --> 12:13.297
The night we finally
tracked down The Artist,
Zeke was killed.

12:14.908 --> 12:17.649
Jake, I'’m so sorry.
I... I had no idea.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.043
There'’s more.

12:23.090 --> 12:27.398
That night,
we were pursuing The Artist
in a patrol car.

12:28.530 --> 12:31.925
We collided.
Our vehicles flipped.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.362
I must have
lost consciousness
for a moment

12:34.405 --> 12:37.104
because I don'’t remember
Zeke getting out.

12:38.670 --> 12:41.064
I just seen him standing
next to The Artist and...

12:42.849 --> 12:44.285
And what?

12:48.289 --> 12:51.161
Zeke doused himself
in gasoline

12:51.205 --> 12:53.903
and set himself on fire.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.789
[pendant jingling]

13:30.592 --> 13:33.421
[Dr. Loesch] Mr. Lefeuvre is
monitored around the clock.

13:33.464 --> 13:38.295
He'’s actually the only resident
of a psychiatric institution
scheduled for execution.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.080
The court declared
him sane, right?

13:40.123 --> 13:43.083
Yes, I read
the mental evaluation
presented at his trial.

13:43.126 --> 13:44.214
And you disagree?

13:44.258 --> 13:46.129
My opinion'’s irrelevant.

13:46.173 --> 13:49.654
The Artist was transferred
here to prevent
any further self-harm.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.439
Self-harm?

13:51.482 --> 13:52.875
Slashing his wrists

13:52.919 --> 13:55.835
and painting on the walls
in his own blood.

13:59.795 --> 14:00.840
Thank you.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.691
[chains rattling]

14:46.233 --> 14:51.412
-Mr. Lefeuvre, my name is
Detective Mary Kelly.
-I know who you are.

14:51.455 --> 14:55.677
-Sorry. Did someone tell you
that I was coming?
-Yes. A winged friend told me.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.507
Well, I'’m sure someone like you

14:59.550 --> 15:03.511
has much better use
of their time than
conversing with birds.

15:03.554 --> 15:06.296
And who said anything
about a bird?

15:08.864 --> 15:11.301
The reason for my visit today
is actually because--

15:11.345 --> 15:13.521
Regarding the copycat,
no doubt.

15:13.564 --> 15:18.439
I presume you'’d hoped
to pick at my brain
on the matter.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.310
Yes, I was--

15:20.354 --> 15:22.878
I was hoping that you
might familiarize yourself
with the case.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.054
If you saw some photos
of the victims,

15:25.098 --> 15:27.578
maybe you would notice
something that could help us.

15:27.622 --> 15:30.451
And if I notice something,
what would be in it for me?

15:30.494 --> 15:32.148
I just assumed
a man like you

15:32.192 --> 15:34.542
wouldn'’t want his legacy
tarnished by an impostor.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.326
That'’s semi-clever, Mary.

15:37.632 --> 15:41.201
I'’m afraid you'’ll have to take
a different tack with me.

15:41.244 --> 15:43.290
Okay, then,
I will talk to Dr. Loesch

15:43.333 --> 15:45.379
and see if we can get you
some better meal options.

15:45.422 --> 15:49.426
Two weeks before my execution,
you think I'’ll be swayed
by a new menu?

15:49.470 --> 15:51.167
Extending the time
in the yard then?

15:51.211 --> 15:53.865
I abhor physical exertion
of any kind.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.260
"No" again, I'’m afraid.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.828
But let'’s cut to the chase,
shall we?

15:59.871 --> 16:03.788
I want my death sentence
commuted to life in prison.

16:03.832 --> 16:06.922
I'’m afraid I don't have
the authority to offer you that.

16:06.966 --> 16:11.796
You will have once we show
the authorities something.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.884
May I?

16:33.383 --> 16:36.212
Photographs of my art macabre

16:36.256 --> 16:38.562
can still be seen
on the Internet

16:38.606 --> 16:40.564
if one knows where to look,

16:40.608 --> 16:42.653
and then used
to replicate my work.

16:42.697 --> 16:46.788
So, the suspect could be
literally anyone.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.443
No, not anyone.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.053
The preservative
was a match.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.142
Your formula, it was
sealed by court order.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.231
It was never released
to the public.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.842
So, this copycat,
he knows far more
than he should.

16:57.886 --> 17:02.499
Maybe it was someone
that you knew from your past,
someone that you confided in?

17:04.545 --> 17:07.069
Could you leave
the file with me tonight?

17:07.113 --> 17:09.376
I'’d like to study it in detail.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.423
I'’ll have Dr. Loesch
bring it to your cell.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.556
In the meantime,
I have prepared some questions

17:15.599 --> 17:17.210
that might help refresh
your memory.

17:17.253 --> 17:20.474
That won'’t be necessary.
My memory is absolute.

17:20.517 --> 17:23.042
But I would like your help
with a different matter.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.871
-What is that?
-My art supplies.

17:26.915 --> 17:30.875
They'’ve been in
the Sheriff'’s Department storage
since my arrest.

17:30.919 --> 17:34.836
I want them back with permission
to use them in my cell.

17:34.879 --> 17:39.406
I must have
my art supplies, Mary,
or we can'’t proceed.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.495
It'’s nonnegotiable.

17:43.932 --> 17:47.501
Reminder that my hour of death
is fast approaching.

17:47.544 --> 17:48.589
Thank you, Mary.

17:50.721 --> 17:53.463
I'’ll see
what I can do.

17:53.507 --> 17:57.032
Should you find anything,
Dr. Loesch will provide you
access to a phone.

17:57.076 --> 18:02.385
Mary, are you familiar with
the archangel Samael?

18:02.429 --> 18:05.127
Yes, but I outgrew fairy tales.

18:14.658 --> 18:17.008
And then along comes Mary.

18:17.052 --> 18:18.749
[door opens, closes]

18:26.192 --> 18:30.326
He knew I was coming.
Someone on the inside must
be feeding him information.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.329
What about our case?
Is he willing to help?

18:33.373 --> 18:36.158
-Uh... [sighs]
-What does he want?

18:36.202 --> 18:38.029
He wants his sentence commuted.

18:38.073 --> 18:40.684
-No damn way!
-Okay. He might know something.

18:40.728 --> 18:42.208
Don'’t be naive, Mary.

18:42.251 --> 18:44.166
He only said what
you wanted to hear.

18:44.210 --> 18:47.387
Naive? Wow.
That was uncalled for.I'’m sorry.

18:47.430 --> 18:50.085
But two weeks from now
that bastard'’s gonna fry,

18:50.129 --> 18:52.435
and the world'’ll be
a better place for it.

19:19.332 --> 19:22.509
[sighs] I think we both
could use a coffee.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.380
I'’m okay. Thank you.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.287
[gasps]

20:02.723 --> 20:04.681
[muttering]

20:04.725 --> 20:07.249
Sir, step away from
the vehicle right now.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.859
I'’m not gonna ask you again.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.389
[knock on window]

20:18.304 --> 20:20.523
Mind unlocking it?Yeah. Sorry.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.047
Thank you.

20:49.857 --> 20:52.860
Not a single print,
trace of DNA.

20:53.904 --> 20:56.037
Same as the others
five years ago.

21:17.885 --> 21:19.800
[guard over intercom]
Yeah, what is it?

21:19.843 --> 21:23.238
Tell Dr. Loesch I need to
speak with Detective Kelly.

42:52.613 --> 42:54.267
This is Doyle.

42:54.310 --> 42:55.355
Evidence room.

43:17.682 --> 43:19.684
[whirring]

43:50.018 --> 43:51.411
What is that? German?

43:51.454 --> 43:53.631
Uh, Dutch, I believe.

43:55.633 --> 43:59.332
"Het helse landschap."
"The inferno landscape."

44:00.725 --> 44:02.117
Wait. What?

44:02.944 --> 44:04.729
You okay?

44:04.772 --> 44:09.342
Before Zeke died,
he texted me this.

44:11.910 --> 44:13.825
[Mary] It'’s an art book.

44:13.868 --> 44:18.743
"The newly discovered work
by 16th-century master
Hieronymus Bosch."

44:19.874 --> 44:21.354
It says it'’s out of print.

44:21.397 --> 44:23.399
I know where
we could find a copy.

44:26.489 --> 44:28.709
[Jake] The Inferno Landscape.

44:28.753 --> 44:33.496
I read it a couple of times,
but never figured out
what Zeke was trying to tell me.

44:47.293 --> 44:48.381
[Mary] Samael.

44:51.253 --> 44:53.821
The Artist mentioned that name.

44:53.865 --> 44:57.259
Samael was a fallen angel
cast into hell.

44:57.303 --> 45:00.872
But he'’s better known as--Lucifer, yeah.
I'’m familiar with the story.

45:10.882 --> 45:13.145
[applause]

45:13.188 --> 45:17.279
We thank Father Linares
for his testimony.

45:17.323 --> 45:20.021
The exorcisms
he participated in

45:20.065 --> 45:22.850
during his final
mission to Ethiopia

45:22.894 --> 45:28.464
provide us with
a better understanding
of the phenomena of possession.

45:34.079 --> 45:36.734
-What are we doing here?
-I want you to meet
an old friend.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.345
Enjoy.

45:42.914 --> 45:48.136
Thank you, Father.
Allow me to introduce
my partner, Mary Kelly.

45:48.180 --> 45:53.489
Father, I was wondering
if you could look into
Mary'’s etheric aura.

45:53.533 --> 45:55.317
I believe she may
need a healing.

45:55.361 --> 45:56.579
What are you talking about?

45:57.798 --> 46:00.975
She'’s been exposed
to a negative force,

46:01.019 --> 46:03.543
the evil man
at the center of
our investigation.

46:03.586 --> 46:04.762
My God, I'’m out of here.

46:05.937 --> 46:07.025
Mary, wait.

46:07.068 --> 46:08.417
What was that back there?

46:08.461 --> 46:09.810
Look, I was only
trying to help.

46:09.854 --> 46:11.638
You'’re trying
to help how?[sighs]

46:11.681 --> 46:13.814
Look, I'’ve been studying,
learning new things.

46:13.858 --> 46:15.555
I want to share '’em with you.

46:15.598 --> 46:17.426
I thought you were different
than Dutch and all the others.

46:17.470 --> 46:19.341
But I guess I was wrong.No, no, no.

46:19.385 --> 46:23.258
I am trying to catch
a serial killer.
You'’re wasting our time.

46:23.302 --> 46:25.304
Jake, you can believe
whatever you want.

46:25.347 --> 46:27.480
What you read in your own time,
that'’s your business.

46:27.523 --> 46:30.135
But when superstition starts
interfering with the work,
then I have a problem.

46:30.178 --> 46:32.746
If you want to be reassigned,
just ask the sheriff.

46:32.790 --> 46:36.445
-I'’m sure Dutch would
welcome you with open arms--
-That is not what I'’m saying.

46:36.489 --> 46:41.102
Jake, this is not healthy,
especially for you, okay?

46:45.019 --> 46:48.066
Hey, car'’s this way.I'’m taking a walk.

46:48.631 --> 46:49.632
Mary.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.115
[sighs]

46:57.292 --> 46:58.554
[exhales]

47:18.096 --> 47:21.055
[monitor beeping]

47:30.064 --> 47:32.110
[dove cooing]

47:37.724 --> 47:38.856
[horse whinnies]

47:41.510 --> 47:43.425
[whinnies, grunts]

48:03.097 --> 48:05.926
[beeping continues]

48:21.768 --> 48:23.639
Is he all right?

48:23.683 --> 48:26.860
Pulse and breathing are normal.
He'’s fine.

48:26.904 --> 48:29.558
Yeah, you filed
numerous reports
to extend his stay.

48:29.602 --> 48:32.344
And I'’ve read your report
on his supposed self-harm.

48:32.387 --> 48:34.215
It'’s a little overstated,
in my opinion.

48:34.259 --> 48:36.522
Do you have a medical degree?

48:36.565 --> 48:38.785
Just a master'’s
in common sense.

48:38.828 --> 48:41.919
Do you want to level with me,
or should I go to
the board of directors instead?

48:45.400 --> 48:47.707
[sighs]
His mind fascinates me.

48:47.750 --> 48:50.188
I'’ve been studying him
ever since he arrived.

48:50.231 --> 48:52.930
At any rate, we both
want him here for now.

49:01.590 --> 49:04.637
[train horn blowing]

49:19.043 --> 49:21.959
[over radio] Dispatch
controller Reynes SD751.

49:22.002 --> 49:24.439
Groundskeeper'’s truck used in
lieutenant governor'’s abduction

49:24.483 --> 49:26.441
was just found
outside Parrie Reserve.

49:26.485 --> 49:29.444
Located the vehicle.
In standby and awaiting CSI.

49:31.142 --> 49:35.015
[whistling]

49:35.059 --> 49:36.495
[knocks]

49:36.538 --> 49:37.887
Come in.

49:39.237 --> 49:40.760
These were just
dropped off.

49:40.803 --> 49:41.848
Thanks.

49:51.858 --> 49:53.903
Uh, ten minutes ago, sir.

49:54.948 --> 49:57.037
Yeah, yeah.
I saw the photo myself.

49:57.081 --> 49:59.344
I forwarded them
to your private email.

50:02.738 --> 50:04.697
Yeah. Yeah.

50:05.437 --> 50:07.091
Uh, yes.[door closes]

50:07.134 --> 50:09.049
I believe it'’s
our only option, actually.

50:09.093 --> 50:11.312
I mean, look... [scoffs]

50:11.356 --> 50:14.620
There'’s no guarantees here,
but time is not our friend.

50:15.925 --> 50:17.797
Of course, Governor.

50:17.840 --> 50:20.974
[sighs] I had to inform
the governor of all our options,

50:22.106 --> 50:24.108
including The Artist'’s request.

50:24.151 --> 50:25.239
Damn it!

50:26.153 --> 50:27.198
You know, Jake,

50:27.241 --> 50:28.677
maybe you ought to think about

50:28.721 --> 50:30.636
sitting the rest
of this one out.

50:30.679 --> 50:33.247
Take a little break,
time for yourself.
It'’d be understandable.

50:33.291 --> 50:36.903
Look, Lieutenant Governor Diaz
doesn'’t match the profile
of any of the other victims.

50:36.946 --> 50:38.600
Are we sure that
this is our guy?

50:38.644 --> 50:41.386
He abandoned his truck
a couple blocks away.

50:41.429 --> 50:43.997
Inside, we found trace amounts
of chloroform

50:44.041 --> 50:45.694
and the dove feathers--
all matches.

50:45.738 --> 50:47.783
And then, there are these.

50:51.135 --> 50:56.096
Delivered to the psych institute
via courier service.
Addressed to Arnaud Lefeuvre.

50:58.229 --> 51:00.187
He'’s trying
to prove himself
to the master.

51:00.231 --> 51:01.275
Or...

51:03.451 --> 51:04.931
Or is he showing off?

51:05.975 --> 51:07.412
Boasting he can do better.

51:07.455 --> 51:10.110
I mean,
The Artist never targeted

51:10.154 --> 51:12.634
such a high-profile victim
like this, Detective.

51:12.678 --> 51:14.810
Regardless, I'’m convinced--

51:14.854 --> 51:17.639
I'’m convinced
they'’ve been communicating
since the very beginning.

51:17.683 --> 51:21.121
Maybe using code to get past all
the inspections. I don'’t know.

51:21.165 --> 51:22.818
We'’re gonna know shortly,
though.

51:22.862 --> 51:24.907
What are you talking about?

51:24.951 --> 51:26.779
Um, Dr. Loesch has agreed

51:26.822 --> 51:29.303
to, uh, help us take
a closer look.

51:29.347 --> 51:31.436
No. I gave The Artist my word.

51:31.479 --> 51:33.742
-I'’m not gonna risk losing
his trust right now.
-He'’ll never know.

51:33.786 --> 51:35.222
Sure. Yeah.

51:40.488 --> 51:43.100
[Diaz crying]

51:53.197 --> 51:55.982
[crying continues]

51:57.418 --> 51:59.638
No, please!

51:59.681 --> 52:00.943
No!

52:00.987 --> 52:03.120
-[rain falling]
-[thunder rumbling]

52:16.220 --> 52:17.873
[breathing heavily]

52:21.660 --> 52:23.140
[roaring]

52:37.458 --> 52:38.720
What are you doing?

52:41.245 --> 52:42.507
Couldn'’t sleep.

52:59.524 --> 53:01.917
[Dr. Loesch]
Your commutation order,
signed by the governor.

53:01.961 --> 53:03.876
Effective
under one condition:

53:03.919 --> 53:06.226
Lieutenant Governor Diaz
must be found alive.

53:06.270 --> 53:08.968
-What is this?
-Medical checkup.

53:21.372 --> 53:23.156
Bullshit.

53:39.955 --> 53:41.609
[Dr. Loesch]
You have 45 minutes.

53:41.653 --> 53:42.915
Yeah, that'’s plenty.

54:10.421 --> 54:12.336
Something familiar
about that mug.

54:12.379 --> 54:14.425
Stay on task, Detective.

54:14.468 --> 54:15.513
[camera shutter clicks]

54:52.506 --> 54:55.509
He struck again.Hmm.

54:55.553 --> 55:01.036
I'’m revisiting
a childhood favorite.

55:01.080 --> 55:04.605
The Ecstasy of Santa Teresa.
Bernini.

55:05.650 --> 55:07.521
By the way,
your friends were here.

55:07.565 --> 55:11.133
-It wasn'’t my idea.
-And they left empty-handed.

55:11.177 --> 55:13.048
I tried
to stop them.
I...

55:13.092 --> 55:15.181
Do you remember
I told you, Mary,

55:15.224 --> 55:17.401
that I would help you
but not them?

55:22.667 --> 55:26.801
Oh, I took all my letters
and burned them

55:26.845 --> 55:29.195
and flushed the ashes
down the toilet.

55:35.027 --> 55:38.900
But not before
committing them to memory.

55:41.816 --> 55:44.166
Mr. Lefeuvre, please.

55:44.210 --> 55:45.733
Tell me what you remember.

55:46.691 --> 55:48.954
You tell me
something first, Mary.

55:49.694 --> 55:51.913
You tell me if you believe

55:51.957 --> 55:55.308
that a man who is free
inside his own mind

55:55.352 --> 55:59.878
can truly be confined
behind the bars of a prison.

56:03.229 --> 56:04.796
I don'’t follow.

56:09.453 --> 56:11.324
The sketch.

56:15.241 --> 56:18.157
[dog barking][siren wailing]

56:18.200 --> 56:19.941
[train horn blowing]

56:19.985 --> 56:21.378
[knock on door]

56:24.903 --> 56:27.384
Boy, let'’s go.

56:27.427 --> 56:28.385
Come here.

56:29.429 --> 56:30.865
My two o'’clock's here.

56:34.260 --> 56:35.783
Keep quiet.

57:20.045 --> 57:23.091
[moaning in distance]

57:37.628 --> 57:40.065
[moaning continues]

57:56.560 --> 57:59.171
-What are you doing?
-What the hell did
I tell ya, boy?

58:00.694 --> 58:02.217
Why did you do that?

58:02.261 --> 58:04.263
No more religious shit!Stop!

58:05.307 --> 58:07.309
-Ain'’t nothing
but brainwashing.
-Stop!

58:07.353 --> 58:10.878
I won'’t tolerate it.But I like
the old masters'’ style.

58:10.922 --> 58:14.882
You wanna draw something,
draw a dog or a real
live person, for once!

58:21.585 --> 58:24.805
[siren wailing]

58:28.635 --> 58:31.159
In the subsequent
two years,

58:32.465 --> 58:35.337
I was confined
to a wheelchair.

58:36.295 --> 58:37.514
But...

58:40.212 --> 58:44.259
[loudly] Jake, you know
all about that, don'’t you?

58:44.999 --> 58:46.435
Jake!

58:46.479 --> 58:48.525
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

58:54.008 --> 58:58.273
Mr. Lefeuvre,
I am sure your childhood
was very difficult,

58:58.317 --> 59:00.493
but time is of
the essence right now.

59:00.537 --> 59:03.365
I need you to talk to me
about the copycat.

59:03.409 --> 59:04.453
Please.

59:05.454 --> 59:08.109
I'’m nearly
out of sculpting clay.

59:09.502 --> 59:12.679
I'’ll replenish that.
Please talk to me
about the copycat.

59:16.074 --> 59:18.772
The gentleman you seek

59:18.816 --> 59:21.601
is a forger
of Renaissance paintings,

59:21.645 --> 59:23.864
primarily religious in theme.

59:23.908 --> 59:28.695
I used to frequent
a quaint little antique store
called Langdon & Sons.

59:28.739 --> 59:31.219
And they,
more than occasionally,

59:31.263 --> 59:34.614
displayed some of
his counterfeits there, Mary.

59:42.883 --> 59:43.928
[door closes]

1:00:17.309 --> 1:00:18.310
We'’re not open yet.

1:00:18.353 --> 1:00:20.181
We'’re not customers.

1:00:20.225 --> 1:00:22.793
-Well, you just can'’t
barge in here---
-Without a warrant?

1:00:22.836 --> 1:00:25.883
[clock ticking]

1:00:35.806 --> 1:00:36.850
Jake.

1:00:39.679 --> 1:00:43.378
What about it?When The Artist referenced
a painting, he made a...

1:00:43.422 --> 1:00:44.989
Who painted this?

1:00:45.946 --> 1:00:47.905
He wished to remain anonymous.

1:00:47.948 --> 1:00:51.169
I paid him in cash
and I never saw him again.

1:00:51.212 --> 1:00:53.214
We'’re gonna need
to seize it as evidence.

1:01:03.529 --> 1:01:05.357
Hey, when did you get
a search warrant?

1:01:05.400 --> 1:01:08.752
I didn'’t.
I always keep a blank one handy.

1:01:08.795 --> 1:01:11.363
No one ever
reads them.
[laughs]

1:01:16.107 --> 1:01:17.717
[gunshot]

1:01:17.761 --> 1:01:20.459
If you knock on
the devil'’s door, he'll answer.

1:01:20.502 --> 1:01:22.156
It'’s the freak who
broke into my house!

1:01:23.941 --> 1:01:25.420
Mary, wait!

1:01:28.119 --> 1:01:29.163
Wait!

1:01:56.930 --> 1:01:59.454
[homeless person]
You should'’ve
listened to me, Mary!

1:02:02.066 --> 1:02:03.676
Put your hands above your head.

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:05.286
-It'’s too late now, Mary.
-Back off!

1:02:05.330 --> 1:02:08.202
-I will shoot. I will shoot.
-Pull that trigger, Mary!

1:02:08.246 --> 1:02:10.552
You don'’t have the guts
to pull that trigger!

1:02:10.596 --> 1:02:12.598
I tried to warn you.

1:02:14.905 --> 1:02:16.254
No!

1:02:17.342 --> 1:02:18.473
[thud]

1:02:24.349 --> 1:02:27.047
[sheriff] Javier Salazar,
the man who assaulted you,

1:02:27.091 --> 1:02:30.137
was employed at the institute
until last year.

1:02:30.181 --> 1:02:32.226
Worked there as a nurse.

1:02:32.270 --> 1:02:35.534
We'’re comparing his DNA
with the salivary DNA
found on the envelope

1:02:35.577 --> 1:02:38.755
that contained
Lieutenant Governor Diaz'’s
photos.

1:02:38.798 --> 1:02:43.020
What we know already, he was
in daily direct contact
with The Artist.

1:02:43.063 --> 1:02:46.371
He was the RN in charge
of drug administration.

1:02:46.414 --> 1:02:48.939
I'’ve already checked
Salazar'’s record.

1:02:48.982 --> 1:02:51.289
He was let go
due to his mental condition.

1:02:51.332 --> 1:02:53.247
Acute bipolarism,
according to Dr. Loesch.

1:02:53.291 --> 1:02:56.381
Look, he sounds psychotic,
so it'’s really hard to believe

1:02:56.424 --> 1:02:58.687
that he'’s capable
of such elaborate murders.

1:02:58.731 --> 1:03:00.820
We won'’t know for sure
until the DNA comes back,

1:03:00.864 --> 1:03:03.127
but I'’m pretty damn confident
he was our guy, Mary.

1:03:05.216 --> 1:03:07.827
We still have
a missing woman, sir.

1:03:07.871 --> 1:03:10.743
The lab'’s running
soil traces
on Salazar'’s shoes.

1:03:10.787 --> 1:03:13.006
We want to pinpoint
exactly where he'’s been.

1:03:14.312 --> 1:03:16.488
Any results on that painting?

1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:35.594
There.

1:03:37.248 --> 1:03:39.990
Thumb. Must have brushed
the wet paint.

1:03:40.033 --> 1:03:41.774
[thunder rumbling]

1:03:41.818 --> 1:03:44.690
[rain falling]

1:03:44.733 --> 1:03:47.214
I offered Zeke
a full confession,

1:03:47.258 --> 1:03:49.303
and all I asked for
in return

1:03:49.347 --> 1:03:51.828
was for him to sit
for his portrait.

1:03:51.871 --> 1:03:54.743
In fact, I would like
to make the same offer to you.

1:03:54.787 --> 1:03:58.399
Of course,
I'’m perfectly capable
of drawing from memory.

1:03:58.443 --> 1:04:00.619
Would you care
to sit for me?

1:04:02.664 --> 1:04:04.710
[chattering]

1:04:04.753 --> 1:04:07.104
[radio chatter][phone rings]

1:04:09.062 --> 1:04:11.064
Got a print on the painting,
Detective.

1:04:11.108 --> 1:04:13.240
Did you run it through AFIS,
confirming it'’s Salazar's?

1:04:13.284 --> 1:04:15.112
Belongs to a woman, actually.

1:04:15.155 --> 1:04:18.942
We had her print on file
from a prostitution arrest
years ago.

1:04:18.985 --> 1:04:21.466
Name and address?It'’s all in there, Detective.

1:04:22.423 --> 1:04:23.947
Hey.What'’s going on?

1:04:23.990 --> 1:04:25.644
I'’ll bring you
up to speed en route.

1:04:25.687 --> 1:04:27.211
Take some backup.

1:04:30.910 --> 1:04:32.781
[sirens wailing]

1:04:57.328 --> 1:05:00.026
[sirens whoop][radio chatter]

1:05:01.245 --> 1:05:06.250
[doves cooing]

1:05:35.714 --> 1:05:39.370
[chattering]

1:05:44.766 --> 1:05:46.290
You might want to see this.

1:05:59.694 --> 1:06:02.828
No, it can'’t be her.
This body'’s been here
for far too long.

1:06:02.871 --> 1:06:06.005
This level of desiccation
would take years.

1:06:06.049 --> 1:06:08.051
[insect buzzing]

1:06:08.094 --> 1:06:10.879
[Mary] He must have been testing
the preservative on her.

1:06:10.923 --> 1:06:13.273
Turned this whole apartment
into an art studio

1:06:13.317 --> 1:06:15.580
to measure the rate
of decomposition.

1:06:21.368 --> 1:06:23.631
I wouldn'’t touch that
if I were you.

1:06:23.675 --> 1:06:25.198
Poison?

1:06:25.242 --> 1:06:27.461
It'’s probably ricin
extracted from castor beans.

1:06:27.505 --> 1:06:30.551
Same toxin he used
on the other girls.

1:06:30.595 --> 1:06:32.771
A single drop
can kill a horse.

1:06:37.994 --> 1:06:40.692
So, the Bosch
wasn'’t a Bosch at all,

1:06:40.735 --> 1:06:43.912
but a forgery
painted right here.

1:06:52.095 --> 1:06:55.272
Gotta be crawling
with Salazar'’s DNA.

1:06:55.315 --> 1:06:56.882
I don'’t think so.

1:07:00.625 --> 1:07:04.150
Welcome to
The Artist'’s home, Jake.

1:07:05.412 --> 1:07:07.371
He'’s playing games with us.

1:07:09.199 --> 1:07:11.244
He turned his own mother
into a guinea pig.

1:07:13.377 --> 1:07:15.640
[cell phone vibrates]

1:07:16.945 --> 1:07:18.904
[Mary] Salazar'’s DNA--

1:07:19.470 --> 1:07:21.080
Not a match.

1:07:46.453 --> 1:07:48.325
[siren wails]

1:07:56.811 --> 1:08:00.163
You knew that painting would
take us to the apartment,

1:08:00.206 --> 1:08:02.252
and you wanted us
to find your mother.

1:08:02.295 --> 1:08:06.647
-Why?
-Because I wanted you to
understand who I truly am.

1:08:06.691 --> 1:08:09.911
I have read
every single public record

1:08:09.955 --> 1:08:12.784
with your name on it,
including the court cases.

1:08:12.827 --> 1:08:15.526
I have a very good grasp
on who you are.

1:08:15.569 --> 1:08:18.746
Did you ever think there may
be truths about me, Mary,

1:08:18.790 --> 1:08:21.662
that are not contained
in those files?

1:08:21.706 --> 1:08:24.491
This all began when
I was working on a piece

1:08:24.535 --> 1:08:26.493
called
The Inferno Landscape.

1:08:26.537 --> 1:08:28.756
And then I heard a voice,

1:08:28.800 --> 1:08:31.933
and that was the voice
of the archangel Samael.

1:08:31.977 --> 1:08:33.544
Why am I listening to this?

1:08:33.587 --> 1:08:36.764
And that voice opened
my ears and my eyes

1:08:36.808 --> 1:08:38.897
to who I really am.

1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:43.423
You'’ve given me nothing
on the copycat.

1:08:43.467 --> 1:08:45.164
I'’ll let the governor know.

1:08:45.208 --> 1:08:48.515
Too bad for you.
I can tell you exactly
where to find him.

1:08:49.473 --> 1:08:51.214
Why should I believe you?

1:08:51.257 --> 1:08:53.085
What choice do you have?

1:08:53.129 --> 1:08:57.089
By the time I finish,
you'’ll have his exact address.

1:08:57.133 --> 1:08:58.351
I promise you.

1:08:59.222 --> 1:09:00.745
Finish what?

1:09:00.788 --> 1:09:01.833
Sculpting.

1:09:03.226 --> 1:09:04.270
Sculpting you.

1:09:05.489 --> 1:09:07.665
You are a sick man.

1:09:07.708 --> 1:09:09.710
Because you don'’t
realize something.

1:09:09.754 --> 1:09:13.061
If the lieutenant governor dies,
you'’re going to the chair.

1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:17.414
And you don'’t care.

1:09:18.458 --> 1:09:20.199
What are you doing?

1:09:20.243 --> 1:09:21.244
Waiting.

1:09:23.071 --> 1:09:25.117
You can'’t be serious
right now.

1:09:26.031 --> 1:09:27.337
Deathly.

1:09:29.991 --> 1:09:31.515
Make yourself comfortable.

1:09:33.865 --> 1:09:35.519
If you want that address.

1:09:41.307 --> 1:09:44.702
Here'’s the deal.
You have ten minutes
and not a second more.

1:09:44.745 --> 1:09:47.792
At the end of those ten minutes,
you'’re giving me the address.

1:09:47.835 --> 1:09:50.360
Agreed. Shall we?

1:10:01.197 --> 1:10:04.765
The human form
is a divine work

1:10:04.809 --> 1:10:07.115
of grace and proportion,

1:10:07.159 --> 1:10:09.640
but the same cannot
be said, however,

1:10:09.683 --> 1:10:11.468
for the human mind,

1:10:12.338 --> 1:10:15.559
which is weak and corruptible.

1:10:15.602 --> 1:10:18.649
To create a sculpture
is to solve a mystery.

1:10:19.824 --> 1:10:23.349
Every contour
a destination,

1:10:23.393 --> 1:10:25.525
every gaze a road map,

1:10:26.439 --> 1:10:29.747
every expression and hollow

1:10:30.617 --> 1:10:32.967
the hidden address
of the soul.

1:10:34.447 --> 1:10:37.842
Did you know, Mary,
that when I first
glimpse a person,

1:10:37.885 --> 1:10:41.149
their story is already
revealed to me?

1:10:41.193 --> 1:10:45.371
And that yours is
the tale of a young woman

1:10:45.415 --> 1:10:49.462
plagued by terrible scars
from her childhood.

1:10:50.376 --> 1:10:52.117
We all have old wounds.

1:10:53.684 --> 1:10:57.601
Wounds are
the trademark of warriors,
wouldn'’t you agree?

1:10:59.733 --> 1:11:02.258
And God could have
healed your wounds.

1:11:03.824 --> 1:11:06.958
But you turn your back
on him. Why, Mary?

1:11:13.094 --> 1:11:15.053
My father.

1:11:15.096 --> 1:11:17.316
A man you haven'’t seen
in many years,

1:11:18.535 --> 1:11:21.668
who you still, in fact,
refuse to see.

1:11:21.712 --> 1:11:25.281
And all he wants to do
is to be able to say
goodbye to you.

1:11:28.501 --> 1:11:32.505
You'’re not guessing anymore.
How do you know that?

1:11:32.549 --> 1:11:34.855
Why won'’t you see him, Mary?

1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:39.947
-You don'’t know
what he put me through.
-What did he put you through?

1:11:39.991 --> 1:11:42.907
Did he abuse you
as my mother
abused me?

1:11:42.950 --> 1:11:44.474
No, no.

1:11:44.517 --> 1:11:46.954
You and I
are not the same.

1:11:47.999 --> 1:11:50.218
That man,
he never touched me. He...

1:11:52.046 --> 1:11:54.527
He would put his hand
on the stove, and...

1:11:55.789 --> 1:11:58.226
he would say, "This is what
happens to flesh in hell."

1:11:58.270 --> 1:12:00.185
And I couldn'’t stop him.

1:12:02.927 --> 1:12:05.625
And you can smell
his burning skin?

1:12:08.019 --> 1:12:09.760
I still can.

1:12:09.803 --> 1:12:14.852
So, he made you responsible for
the torment he was suffering.

1:12:17.420 --> 1:12:20.771
That is truly the stuff
of nightmares, Mary.

1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:25.166
Tell me about them.

1:12:27.778 --> 1:12:29.345
They begin with falling.

1:12:31.042 --> 1:12:32.260
Falling where?

1:12:35.263 --> 1:12:36.700
Into flames.

1:12:40.051 --> 1:12:44.751
The burning was so real
that I could still feel it
when I woke up in the morning.

1:12:44.795 --> 1:12:47.711
Do you still have
those nightmares, Mary?

1:12:50.627 --> 1:12:51.889
No.

1:12:53.717 --> 1:12:56.284
The moment
I stopped believing in hell,
they went away,

1:12:56.328 --> 1:12:58.722
and my father couldn'’t
scare me with them anymore.

1:12:58.765 --> 1:13:02.334
But that made him try
all the harder,
didn'’t it, Mary?

1:13:03.204 --> 1:13:05.424
[Mary] He said I was possessed.

1:13:05.468 --> 1:13:09.297
That I needed help.
And that'’s when he started
dragging me to confession.

1:13:09.341 --> 1:13:12.126
And that'’s where you
first seduced him?

1:13:12.170 --> 1:13:14.259
Right in
the confessional booth?

1:13:15.869 --> 1:13:19.090
Seduced who?The priest who took
your confessions.

1:13:19.133 --> 1:13:22.615
Father Dale.
The one who now
shares your bed.

1:13:26.445 --> 1:13:28.665
Who are you talking to?
Who told you this?

1:13:28.708 --> 1:13:31.842
Do you know why he
shares your bed, Mary?

1:13:32.495 --> 1:13:33.844
Do you?

1:13:33.887 --> 1:13:36.455
I don'’t need to answer
these questions.

1:13:36.499 --> 1:13:38.326
Would you like me
to tell you why?

1:13:38.370 --> 1:13:39.415
Stop! Stop!

1:13:42.853 --> 1:13:44.463
We fell in love.

1:13:44.507 --> 1:13:45.595
Love?

1:13:47.510 --> 1:13:49.381
You fell in love?

1:13:49.425 --> 1:13:51.949
He chose
a different life with me.

1:13:53.516 --> 1:13:55.866
So, it was true love,
correct?

1:13:55.909 --> 1:13:57.171
Yes.Uh-huh.

1:13:57.215 --> 1:13:59.391
And when you tell
yourself that, Mary,

1:13:59.435 --> 1:14:01.349
-do you believe it?
-Yes.

1:14:01.393 --> 1:14:03.351
You actually
believe that?Yes.

1:14:03.395 --> 1:14:06.006
-I don'’t think you do.
-Yes, I do.

1:14:06.050 --> 1:14:10.010
Or didn'’t you,
in fact, do it merely
to spite your father?

1:14:13.884 --> 1:14:17.365
Thank you
for sitting for me, Mary.

1:14:19.455 --> 1:14:21.457
It'’s very much
appreciated.

1:14:23.110 --> 1:14:24.460
It'’s your turn.

1:14:25.939 --> 1:14:27.550
The address. Now.

1:14:27.593 --> 1:14:31.902
The address
is 1522 Lola Court.

1:14:32.903 --> 1:14:34.513
Was that loud enough?

1:14:34.557 --> 1:14:37.298
Or shall I repeat it
for your colleagues?

1:14:37.342 --> 1:14:40.345
1522 Lola Court.
Come on, people! Let'’s go!

1:14:40.388 --> 1:14:43.435
[sirens wailing]

1:14:46.830 --> 1:14:50.007
Mary, you'’re
forgetting something.

1:14:54.315 --> 1:14:55.882
This is for you.

1:15:04.021 --> 1:15:06.284
And always remember,
Mary,

1:15:06.327 --> 1:15:10.506
that the truth
is only ever found
within ourselves.

1:15:20.037 --> 1:15:21.647
[door closes]

1:15:22.561 --> 1:15:23.780
Need a lift?

1:15:25.651 --> 1:15:27.523
Why didn'’t you go
with the others?

1:15:27.566 --> 1:15:30.917
I figured those apes
could handle an arrest
without me for once.

1:15:30.961 --> 1:15:33.180
Yeah, but it'’s our case.
One of us should'’ve--

1:15:33.224 --> 1:15:35.792
I'’d rather be here
right now.

1:15:35.835 --> 1:15:37.489
Come on, Mary.

1:15:50.589 --> 1:15:53.897
[Diaz breathing shakily, crying]

1:15:53.940 --> 1:15:55.594
[Diaz] Oh, my God.

1:15:55.638 --> 1:15:58.336
[sobbing] God.

1:16:03.559 --> 1:16:06.910
[doves cooing]

1:16:11.784 --> 1:16:13.525
[radio chatter]

1:16:23.535 --> 1:16:27.626
I just-- I don'’t understand
how he knows all those things
about my life.

1:16:27.670 --> 1:16:30.716
It'’s stuff that I've only ever
told one other person, and...

1:16:35.286 --> 1:16:38.071
No. No, it can'’t be.

1:16:38.115 --> 1:16:40.683
He'’s just putting things
in my head, right?

1:16:46.602 --> 1:16:49.909
"Truth is found within oneself."
That'’s what he said.

1:16:49.953 --> 1:16:51.955
Who said what?

1:16:57.351 --> 1:16:59.397
Wait, what are you doing?

1:17:09.276 --> 1:17:13.150
Archibald, have you lost
your mind? [gasps]

1:17:14.847 --> 1:17:16.370
Son of a bitch.

1:17:27.077 --> 1:17:29.470
-I'’ll be damned.
-265 Opal Street.

1:17:29.514 --> 1:17:32.125
It'’s the right address.
Do you know where this is?

1:17:32.169 --> 1:17:33.213
Yeah.

1:17:55.453 --> 1:17:56.672
[sighs]

1:18:03.896 --> 1:18:05.942
[animal calling]

1:18:17.214 --> 1:18:19.782
[animals calling]

1:18:33.578 --> 1:18:35.362
[hinge creaks]

1:18:45.764 --> 1:18:47.418
Anyone home?

1:19:03.564 --> 1:19:05.305
What the hell
is all this?

1:19:06.829 --> 1:19:10.615
It'’s me. It's...
It'’s my entire life. It's--

1:19:16.099 --> 1:19:17.535
"Infernum."

1:19:19.058 --> 1:19:21.321
I-It'’s Latin for "hell."

1:19:24.063 --> 1:19:27.110
Come on, Mary.
We really need
to call this in.

1:19:27.153 --> 1:19:29.721
Go ahead. I'’m just gonna
take a few pictures.

1:19:29.765 --> 1:19:31.157
I'’ll catch up, okay?

1:19:50.002 --> 1:19:51.395
[sighs]

1:19:51.438 --> 1:19:54.093
Car 252 to Dispatch.

1:19:57.793 --> 1:20:01.144
[cell phone vibrating]

1:20:01.187 --> 1:20:03.886
Hi, you'’ve reached Dale.
Leave a message.

1:20:03.929 --> 1:20:07.759
[distant crying]

1:20:11.763 --> 1:20:13.504
[crying continues]

1:20:14.244 --> 1:20:15.723

1:20:49.975 --> 1:20:53.674
[distant crying continues]

1:21:09.081 --> 1:21:10.648
Governor Diaz?

1:21:10.691 --> 1:21:12.911
[Diaz] Yes. Who are you?

1:21:12.955 --> 1:21:15.348
I'’m the one who's gonna
get you out of here.Okay.

1:21:16.741 --> 1:21:19.439
-How do you unlock this?
-The devil man. He has the key.

1:21:19.483 --> 1:21:21.093
-Where is he?
-He'’s right there.

1:21:27.273 --> 1:21:29.449
[crying, breathing shakily]

1:21:35.978 --> 1:21:37.675
[breathing shakily]

1:21:37.718 --> 1:21:40.286
Step out with your hands
above your head.

1:21:40.330 --> 1:21:41.244
Slowly.

1:21:43.376 --> 1:21:44.638
Mary.

1:21:50.122 --> 1:21:51.341
Jake?

1:21:52.385 --> 1:21:55.040
Well, yes. And no.

1:21:56.824 --> 1:22:00.002
[as The Artist]
I promised to help you
find the killer, Mary.

1:22:00.045 --> 1:22:01.917
And here he is.

1:22:02.787 --> 1:22:04.180
Jake,
what'’s wrong with you?

1:22:04.223 --> 1:22:06.443
Oh, Jake'’s not here
right now.

1:22:06.486 --> 1:22:11.970
No prison can hold a man
who'’s free inside himself.
Remember, Mary?

1:22:12.014 --> 1:22:14.146
[breathing shakily]

1:22:14.190 --> 1:22:15.800
Lefeuvre?

1:22:15.843 --> 1:22:17.584
That'’s right.

1:22:17.628 --> 1:22:20.413
[breathing shakily]

1:22:25.723 --> 1:22:29.161
You still need to hear
the rest of my story, Mary.

1:22:32.730 --> 1:22:36.386
[children laughing,
chattering]

1:23:05.284 --> 1:23:08.984
Mother destroyed
all my art books,

1:23:09.027 --> 1:23:12.683
forcing me to find
new subjects to draw.

1:23:24.173 --> 1:23:27.828
That'’s when I discovered
my power.

1:23:27.872 --> 1:23:31.615
After capturing
someone'’s likeness
in a drawing,

1:23:33.051 --> 1:23:38.448
I can leave my own body
and temporarily enter theirs.

1:23:46.630 --> 1:23:49.459
I kept it a secret
for many years,

1:23:49.502 --> 1:23:51.548
fearing it to be a curse.

1:23:53.550 --> 1:23:56.770
Until the archangel Samael

1:23:56.814 --> 1:23:58.250
revealed it was a gift...

1:23:58.294 --> 1:23:59.599
[gun clicks]

1:23:59.643 --> 1:24:01.949
...bestowed upon me

1:24:01.993 --> 1:24:04.387
when the spirit
entered my body.

1:24:06.258 --> 1:24:08.608
I was born an angel, Mary.

1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:11.959
Angel of Death.

1:24:12.003 --> 1:24:14.049
[Mary murmuring]

1:24:14.092 --> 1:24:16.138
Come back, come back,
come back.

1:24:16.181 --> 1:24:18.357
Jake, please.
Jake, come back. Please.

1:24:18.401 --> 1:24:19.576
No, no, no!

1:24:19.619 --> 1:24:20.664
[grunts]

1:24:30.587 --> 1:24:33.459
[breathing heavily]

1:24:37.681 --> 1:24:39.726
I have honored the contract.

1:24:40.988 --> 1:24:43.121
Lieutenant governor lives.

1:24:44.644 --> 1:24:47.430
And the killer
will soon be dead.

1:24:48.561 --> 1:24:51.042
And I couldn'’t have done it
without you.

1:24:56.613 --> 1:24:59.006
Now finish the job, Mary.

1:24:59.050 --> 1:25:00.878
One more,

1:25:02.445 --> 1:25:03.794
right here.

1:25:05.665 --> 1:25:07.145
Don'’t be afraid.

1:25:08.015 --> 1:25:10.192
[breathing heavily]

1:25:18.591 --> 1:25:19.984
[as himself] Mary?

1:25:20.027 --> 1:25:21.986
[Jake gasping]

1:25:22.813 --> 1:25:23.857
Where am I?

1:25:30.037 --> 1:25:31.169
I'’m so sorry.

1:25:32.910 --> 1:25:34.390
Jake, I'’m so sorry.

1:25:36.696 --> 1:25:38.176
Jake, it was you.

1:25:51.058 --> 1:25:53.278
You were the copycat
the whole time.

1:25:53.322 --> 1:25:55.062
[breathing shakily]

1:25:56.542 --> 1:25:58.588
You gotta stop him, Mary.

1:26:01.678 --> 1:26:02.722
[gasps]

1:26:08.511 --> 1:26:11.557
[sirens wailing]

1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:18.390
Now, you'’re free to join
your old partner, Jacob.

1:26:20.697 --> 1:26:22.089
Go.

1:26:28.531 --> 1:26:29.793
Go.

1:26:33.449 --> 1:26:35.146
The city can breathe easier

1:26:35.190 --> 1:26:38.584
thanks to Detective Mary Kelly,
whose courageous actions

1:26:38.628 --> 1:26:42.414
ended the killing spree
of her former partner,
Jake Doyle,

1:26:42.458 --> 1:26:44.634
and saved the life
of Lieutenant Governor Diaz.

1:26:44.677 --> 1:26:46.984
[clears throat]You, uh, wanted
to see me, sir?

1:26:47.027 --> 1:26:51.858
I know it'’s not
the happy ending
we all wanted, Detective.

1:26:54.252 --> 1:26:56.472
But you did save
that woman'’s life.

1:26:58.430 --> 1:27:00.780
Psychologists are saying
that Jake suffered from

1:27:00.824 --> 1:27:04.697
some kind of dissociative
identity-type psychosis,

1:27:04.741 --> 1:27:08.092
possibly triggered from the--
from the first case.

1:27:08.135 --> 1:27:11.530
That'’s why he thought
he was The Artist.

1:27:13.184 --> 1:27:14.881
Well,
they are the experts.

1:27:18.233 --> 1:27:19.712
What do you think,
Mary?

1:27:20.583 --> 1:27:22.193
You were there that night.

1:27:27.111 --> 1:27:29.156
What I think won'’t
bring him back, sir.

1:27:34.814 --> 1:27:37.426
The Jake I knew
wasn'’t capable of this.

1:27:38.427 --> 1:27:40.777
And I knew Jake
for a long time.

1:27:48.350 --> 1:27:50.787
I just can'’t wrap
my head around it.

1:27:55.531 --> 1:27:57.837
Whoever believes in me

1:27:57.881 --> 1:28:01.319
should not abide
in the darkness.

1:28:04.148 --> 1:28:05.758
May the Lord

1:28:05.802 --> 1:28:09.675
look kindly on you,

1:28:09.719 --> 1:28:11.111
Elias Kelly.

1:28:12.374 --> 1:28:16.465
In the name of the Father
and the Son

1:28:16.508 --> 1:28:18.858
and the Holy Spirit.

1:28:18.902 --> 1:28:20.251
Amen.

1:28:29.913 --> 1:28:32.350
I'’m glad
you saw your father
before he passed.

1:28:33.569 --> 1:28:35.005
Yeah. Me too.

1:28:41.141 --> 1:28:44.623
Um...
can you give me a minute?

1:28:45.755 --> 1:28:46.799
Yeah.

1:28:49.062 --> 1:28:51.978
-[doves cooing]
-[whistling]

1:28:55.242 --> 1:28:56.635
Dr. Loesch.

1:28:58.289 --> 1:29:01.814
[as The Artist]
Let the earth rest lightly
on him, Mary Kelly.

1:29:05.688 --> 1:29:08.081
Did you know my father,
Dr. Loesch?

1:29:08.125 --> 1:29:10.997
No. I just wanted
to see you.

1:29:11.041 --> 1:29:13.304
No visits. No calls.

1:29:13.348 --> 1:29:15.132
Not even a letter,
Mary Magdalene?

1:29:18.483 --> 1:29:20.746
I was wondering
when you'’d show up.

1:29:20.790 --> 1:29:23.227
I missed you too, Mary.

1:29:25.838 --> 1:29:29.102
You never intended to kill
the lieutenant governor,
did you?

1:29:29.146 --> 1:29:30.756
Very perceptive.

1:29:30.800 --> 1:29:34.586
I was only giving her boss
extra incentive to sign.

1:29:34.630 --> 1:29:35.674
[grunts]

1:29:35.718 --> 1:29:36.849
No, Mary.

1:29:38.155 --> 1:29:40.592
It'’s you who's going
to be next.

1:29:41.767 --> 1:29:43.943
Why the games?

1:29:43.987 --> 1:29:46.424
You could have
just sketched a guard
and wheeled yourself out.

1:29:46.468 --> 1:29:48.470
You could have escaped
at any time.

1:29:48.513 --> 1:29:52.212
To spend the rest of my life
hunted like an animal?

1:29:52.256 --> 1:29:54.040
I think not.

1:29:54.084 --> 1:29:56.347
Escape has never been
my intent, Mary.

1:29:56.391 --> 1:29:59.350
In fact, there couldn'’t be
a more ideal place for me

1:29:59.394 --> 1:30:02.571
to continue
my necessary work.

1:30:04.181 --> 1:30:06.966
As I'’ll soon be
returning the favor

1:30:07.837 --> 1:30:10.753
when I purify your soul,
Mary.

1:30:10.796 --> 1:30:13.103
Today would have been the day.

1:30:13.146 --> 1:30:16.846
Of my execution.
Ironic, isn'’t it?

1:30:16.889 --> 1:30:19.457
I think a little bit more
than you realize.

1:30:19.501 --> 1:30:21.894
And what'’s that
supposed to imply?

1:30:21.938 --> 1:30:24.157
I have a question for you.

1:30:24.201 --> 1:30:26.856
Did you happen
to sketch Dr. Loesch
with a black pencil?

1:30:26.899 --> 1:30:29.467
-I'’m sorry?
-A black charcoal pencil.

1:30:29.511 --> 1:30:32.731
It was part of the art supplies
that were delivered
to your cell yesterday.

1:30:32.775 --> 1:30:35.865
I think you might have
thought that they were
from some deranged fan,

1:30:35.908 --> 1:30:37.606
but no, they were from me.

1:30:37.649 --> 1:30:39.346
See, I noticed
you had this habit

1:30:39.390 --> 1:30:42.785
of chewing on the ends
of your pencils.

1:30:42.828 --> 1:30:45.875
Just added a couple drops
of your special ingredient,

1:30:45.918 --> 1:30:48.268
the same one that you used
on your own mother.

1:30:48.312 --> 1:30:49.356
You'’re bluffing.

1:30:50.967 --> 1:30:53.360
I probably should have filed it
with evidence, but...

1:30:55.101 --> 1:30:58.235
I guess Jake taught me
a few bad habits after all.

1:30:59.454 --> 1:31:00.672
Have a good day.

You know, I was
thinking about that trip
you wanted to take.

To Rome?Yeah, let'’s do it.
