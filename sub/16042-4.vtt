WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:08.490
-We can walk into a bunch
of different banks

00:08.500 --> 00:10.149
and ask for a little bit.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.697
After a few, they could file
a suspicious activities report,

00:12.750 --> 00:14.365
but that takes weeks
to go through.

00:14.450 --> 00:16.190
-That's a great--
I can cover our tracks.
-Yeah?

00:16.290 --> 00:17.826
-Where's Daewon?

00:17.870 --> 00:19.690
- Get down!

00:19.790 --> 00:21.690
-That money isn't yours!
-I invested it.

00:21.790 --> 00:23.075
-You gotta get it back.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.610
Nick...

00:24.660 --> 00:26.321
-So, I'd be back at zero?

00:26.330 --> 00:28.651
-No, no, no, 'cause we would
still have the 300.
-Who is "we"?

00:28.660 --> 00:29.740
-Fucking fine.

00:29.790 --> 00:32.862
-You either_with me
or you against me.

00:32.910 --> 00:36.038
-You ever do any investing
into small businesses
or startups?

00:36.080 --> 00:37.399
-What does a banker
from Brickell,

00:37.450 --> 00:39.077
a hacker from Hialeah,
and a thug

00:39.120 --> 00:40.496
from little Haiti
have In common?

00:40.540 --> 00:41.939
-I don't know.
-Me neither.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.537
But once we do,
that's where the money went.

00:52.660 --> 00:53.649
Phil.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.406
-Oh, goddammit.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.990
-Phil.
-Yeah?

00:57.040 --> 00:58.826
-Just got off the phone
with FinCen.

00:58.870 --> 01:01.532
There was an SAR filed on
Nick Talman a couple weeks ago.

01:01.620 --> 01:03.440
-Where? How much?

01:03.500 --> 01:05.650
-She didn't know,
but she's gonna scan it
and send it to me tonight.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.285
-That's good news.

01:08.330 --> 01:09.991
-It's great news.
-Huh.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.945
_ _ -All we have to do
IS nail down even one of those

01:12.000 --> 01:13.570
and figure out
where it landed.

01:13.620 --> 01:15.247
-All right.
Should we get some food?

01:16.500 --> 01:17.944
-You go ahead.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.570
She's supposed to be
sending this any minute,

01:19.620 --> 01:20.939
and I want to print the files.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.194
-I got a printer
at my place.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.286
I gotta get out of here
before I hang myself.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.946
-Um, okay.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.115
-I'm close by.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.650
There's a great Thai spot
around the corner.

01:30.660 --> 01:32.150
-Sure.
-All right. Cool.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.491
Hey, and well done.

01:34.660 --> 01:35.649
Fuckin'...

01:36.660 --> 01:37.695
What, too hot?

01:37.790 --> 01:38.825
-Mm-hmm.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.530
-Well, that's mild.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.497
-I don't usually do spicy.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.401
-DC must have a ton of great
Thai places though, huh?

01:47.450 --> 01:48.747
-Yeah, it did.
-Mm-hmm.

01:48.790 --> 01:50.109
-Not really my thing though.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.617
I was a country girl.
I grew up in the sticks.

01:52.660 --> 01:54.241
- In the sticks?

01:54.290 --> 01:56.281
- Yes, sir. Outside of Richmond.

01:56.330 --> 01:57.991
Daddy'd hunt rabbit, squirrel.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.496
-No shit?
That's how you sound?

01:59.540 --> 02:01.496
-Mm-hmm. That's my real accent.
-Wow.

02:01.540 --> 02:03.326
-Took me years to lose it.

02:03.370 --> 02:04.826
-It's a shame you lost it.

02:04.870 --> 02:06.326
It's "purty. ll

02:12.160 --> 02:13.991
Okay. Homework.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.031
It's divide and conquer.

02:16.080 --> 02:17.490
Here's the BFO.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.149
-Okay.
-I'll take Valencia.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.781
Cheers.

02:20.830 --> 02:22.491
-Salud.

02:24.500 --> 02:25.489
-Great.

04:32.660 --> 04:33.820
Holy shit.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.867
All two point two million,
you gave it back to him?

05:05.910 --> 05:07.946
-Except for your 300.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.610
-I moved it all in pieces.

05:10.660 --> 05:11.866
Super careful.

05:11.950 --> 05:13.326
No one's gonna notice.

05:13.370 --> 05:16.157
-Yeah, but we are effectively--
We're back at zero.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.320
-Except for my 300.

05:18.410 --> 05:20.241
-Mm-hmm.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.821
-So, technically...

05:24.870 --> 05:26.826
I'm your only investor.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.786
-That is correct. Yes.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.491
-I'm all you got.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.405
-Right you are.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.900
-Well, I'm happy
you feel good about it

05:42.000 --> 05:43.649
'cause I don't think
this guy's gonna say yes,

05:43.700 --> 05:46.658
-That is a great attitude, Nick.

05:46.660 --> 05:48.867
I mean, powerful
salesmanship, dude.

05:48.950 --> 05:51.498
-I'm just trying to keep
our hopes to a minimum.

05:51.540 --> 05:52.825
And why not
get our hopes up?

05:52.830 --> 05:54.320
-Because this guy
is pretty tough

05:54.330 --> 05:56.286
and when he doesn't say yes--
-Oh, he's gonna say yes.

05:56.330 --> 05:58.241
-I want us to be prepared.
Well, you don't know that.

05:58.290 --> 06:00.656
-No, he's gonna say yes.
-Okay. Think so?

06:00.660 --> 06:02.116
-He's gonna say yes.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.616
Now say it with me, dawg.

06:03.660 --> 06:06.072
Now say it.
He's gonna say yes.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.610
-He's--
-He's gonna say yes.

06:07.660 --> 06:08.900
He's gonna say yes.

06:08.950 --> 06:10.497
-He's gonna say yes.
-He's gonna say yes.

06:10.540 --> 06:12.405
-He's gonna say yes.
-He's gonna say yes.

06:12.450 --> 06:14.827
-He's gonna say yes.
-Hey, nobody said this shit
was gonna be easy, dawg.

06:14.870 --> 06:16.861
-Hey! Hey! He's gonna say yes.
-He's gonna say yes.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.901
-All right!
He's gonna say yes.

06:18.950 --> 06:21.111
Hey, guys, Mr. Blush
is ready for you.

06:22.500 --> 06:25.071
He's gonna say yes, baby.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.902
Me, I don't know
anything about tech

06:28.000 --> 06:30.616
or computers or apps
or what have you,

06:30.660 --> 06:34.494
but my consultant
was very impressed
with your code, Izzy.

06:34.500 --> 06:38.493
-And Nick, you know,
Leo will vouch for you.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.320
He says that
you're a good kid,

06:40.330 --> 06:41.615
obviously...

06:41.660 --> 06:43.116
'cause you're banging
his daughter.

06:47.330 --> 06:49.116
-But, uh...

06:49.160 --> 06:52.493
I don't think that I can jump
in this pool just yet.

06:53.660 --> 06:54.900
I'd like to.

06:54.950 --> 06:56.440
Believe me.

06:56.500 --> 07:00.118
But, uh, some of my people say
that there are a lot of other

07:00.160 --> 07:02.617
competitors out there right now
in the cryptocurency market.

07:02.660 --> 07:04.491
Like RadCoin?

07:04.540 --> 07:06.360
-That's one
of the big ones, yeah.

07:06.410 --> 07:09.322
-Dude, Maya Hibert,
I went to Stanford with her.

07:09.330 --> 07:11.491
They've been begging me
to come work for them.

07:11.540 --> 07:14.156
I mean, they're a joke.
Their code is shit.

07:15.540 --> 07:17.326
-Well, maybe so.

07:17.330 --> 07:18.490
But you know what they say.

07:18.540 --> 07:20.576
It doesn't matter
if you're the best.

07:20.620 --> 07:22.906
It only matters
if you're first.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.536
Here, let me get you
another drink.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.070
No?

07:33.450 --> 07:34.997
-We're gonna grab lunch.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.189
Y'all want anything?

07:36.250 --> 07:38.320
-I'm good.
-Oh, no, you should go. Come on.

07:38.370 --> 07:39.496
-Come on.

07:39.540 --> 07:40.905
-Yeah, come on, Maddie.

07:40.950 --> 07:43.498
Take you to Sandoval's.
Get you some real Cuban food

07:43.540 --> 07:45.826
instead of the horse shit
this gringo been feeding you.

07:45.870 --> 07:47.656
-Well, I could use
some alone time.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.997
You, you should go though.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.996
Go on. Go.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.689
-Okay.

07:54.370 --> 07:56.031
You want something?
-No, I'm good.

07:57.330 --> 07:59.150
-See you in a bit.
-See you later.

09:12.660 --> 09:13.740
What's her name?

09:13.830 --> 09:17.152
What's that bitch
from your school named?

09:17.160 --> 09:18.991
Hung-Soo.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.286
-"Hung-Soo."

09:21.330 --> 09:24.037
-The fuck kind of name is that?

09:24.120 --> 09:25.747
-She Chinese, yo.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.649
-For real?

09:29.790 --> 09:31.826
-What you think she was?

09:31.830 --> 09:33.946
-She ain't Haitian.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.695
That's for damn sure.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.997
-No, man.

09:41.500 --> 09:42.615
No.

09:47.950 --> 09:49.497
-You're messing with me
though, right?

09:49.540 --> 09:51.155
-No, man.

10:05.950 --> 10:07.747
- Oh, shit!
- Look, look, look, look, look.

10:07.790 --> 10:09.655
-Shh. I see him, dawg.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.149
That's the third runner
right there.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.319
That's all Jey need.

10:13.330 --> 10:14.820
We're good.

10:14.870 --> 10:16.360
-For real, yo.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.861
-Shit, dawg. Hung-Lee?

10:19.910 --> 10:21.320
-Whatever, man.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.326
-Know what I'm saying though?
We gotta talk about that.

10:23.370 --> 10:25.747
That ain't even
in the blood though.

10:25.790 --> 10:26.779
Ain't right.

10:29.250 --> 10:31.070
Tap that ass first though.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.656
Ah, my boy.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.157
-Get out of here.
-But then leave. Feel me?

10:35.200 --> 10:37.327
Shit. That's all
I'm trying to say.

11:03.950 --> 11:06.111
-Can we just take
a break please?

11:06.160 --> 11:09.197
-What, your ankle?
-Yeah. Just one second.

11:09.250 --> 11:10.694
-Babe!
-It's just a little sore.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.286
-You gotta go to the doctor.

11:12.330 --> 11:13.820
I'm gonna make the appointment.

11:13.870 --> 11:16.407
-It's getting better.
It's just sore.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.036
- All right.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.069
It's nice.

11:24.540 --> 11:25.859
I heard you hung out

11:25.950 --> 11:27.998
with one of my dad's
friends yesterday.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.945
-I did, yeah. Uh...

11:30.000 --> 11:32.491
this guy Benedict that
he had me golf with.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.447
Was that for something
for Valencia or?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.786
-No, it was a pet project.

11:38.830 --> 11:40.240
That GenCoin thing
I was telling you about.

11:40.290 --> 11:41.939
-Right.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.072
And Marci's cool with you
just like, doing something
on the side?

11:45.120 --> 11:46.690
-Mm-hmm.

11:46.750 --> 11:49.150
Yeah, as long as
it doesn't interfere with work.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.282
-Cool.

11:51.330 --> 11:52.786
Well, that's good.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.570
So how'd it go?

11:57.660 --> 12:00.197
-He wasn't all
that into it actually.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.571
Guess saving the world's
not his thing.

12:02.660 --> 12:04.321
-What is his thing?

12:05.660 --> 12:06.991
-Money?

12:09.040 --> 12:10.655
-We||...

12:10.700 --> 12:13.612
then I guess you just gotta
tell him what he wants to hear.

12:13.660 --> 12:15.901
Show him the money.

12:15.950 --> 12:19.158
- I have what it takes
to go hard

12:19.160 --> 12:21.492
G0, 90, 90, 90

12:21.540 --> 12:25.658
G0, 90, 90, 90, 90

12:25.700 --> 12:28.658
I have what it takes
to go hard in the paint

12:30.250 --> 12:31.694
I don't ask for permission

12:31.750 --> 12:33.194
Still get what I want

12:33.250 --> 12:34.569
I'm at the top of the list

12:34.620 --> 12:36.076
Ain't no stoppin' to this

12:36.120 --> 12:37.997
Man, I swear
there ain't nobody

12:38.040 --> 12:40.247
That go harder
than this, oh

12:40.330 --> 12:43.402
They all mad 'cause
I'm about to blow up

12:43.500 --> 12:46.196
'Cause all this hard work
about to show up

12:46.290 --> 12:48.155
See, I put time into this

12:48.200 --> 12:49.531
All day and night into this

12:49.620 --> 12:51.156
That's why
I'm sounding like this

12:51.160 --> 12:52.991
'Cause I got
what it takes to go

12:53.000 --> 12:54.490
I got what it takes to go

12:54.580 --> 12:55.899
I got what it takes to go

12:55.950 --> 12:57.906
I got what it takes
to go hard

12:57.950 --> 13:00.327
G0, 90, 90, 90

13:00.410 --> 13:03.573
G0, 90, 90, 90

13:03.620 --> 13:05.906
G0, 90, 90, 90

13:07.540 --> 13:09.496
-Hey, Ben. Hey.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.326
You want the truth?

13:11.370 --> 13:14.032
And it's a truth I can't say
in front of Izzy and Ronald.

13:14.080 --> 13:17.789
And it's certainly a truth
that I would never, ever say
in front of Leo.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.071
GenCoin for me,
it's not about

13:20.160 --> 13:22.697
giving loans to farmers
in Afghanistan

13:22.750 --> 13:25.992
or bank accounts
to political refugees.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.151
That is just something that's
a New Age hippie pipe dream
we like to tell ourselves

13:29.200 --> 13:31.657
so we can feel good
when we close our eyes at night.

13:31.660 --> 13:33.651
But the truth is
those things won't change.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.577
They never change.
You know that.

13:35.620 --> 13:37.497
That is the way
the world works.

13:37.580 --> 13:40.492
But what GenCoin can do,
as a business,

13:40.500 --> 13:42.320
pure bottom line,

13:42.410 --> 13:44.537
just imagine
owning a fraction

13:44.580 --> 13:47.196
of a penny
of every dollar

13:47.250 --> 13:49.787
spent in the United States.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.536
Think about that.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.196
Owning a piece of currency.

13:54.250 --> 13:58.289
You know how much I care
about kids in the Sudan?

13:58.330 --> 14:02.152
About as much as you care
about cats and dogs.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.197
-All right, one job,
you get your shit back,

14:40.250 --> 14:43.242
I don't chase you anymore.
How's that?

14:43.330 --> 14:44.900
'Cause there's this girl, see?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.490
She's hiding this money.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.865
It's mine.

14:47.910 --> 14:49.992
And she's good,
but she's not as good as you,

14:50.040 --> 14:53.498
so I have to trust you.
You understand that?

14:53.540 --> 14:55.326
I have no other recourse.

14:55.330 --> 14:57.616
But when it's done,
we're done.

14:57.660 --> 15:00.572
You get to keep your drive,
whatever else the Russians
gave you,

15:00.620 --> 15:03.157
go back to Taipei
or Singapore or wherever,

15:03.160 --> 15:05.287
or you can stay
in Miami. I don't care.

15:05.330 --> 15:07.867
The point is,
you do this thing for me,

15:07.910 --> 15:09.366
and you'll be protected.

15:09.410 --> 15:11.071
Forever. How's that?

15:12.580 --> 15:14.366
That's a promise,
by the way.

15:14.410 --> 15:16.651
Solid gold promise.

15:21.950 --> 15:23.190
Yeah.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.991
All right,
I'll be in touch.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.650
-Here you go, fella.

16:10.660 --> 16:12.150
-Ooh!
-There you go.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.156
Load it up,
load it up, load it up.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.492
That's what I'm talking about.
Let's go.

16:16.540 --> 16:20.112
-Come on, come on, get some.
-Y'a|| already know.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.860
-Jey and I be squared

16:39.910 --> 16:41.901

16:44.660 --> 16:46.821
-Had to, dawg.

-All right.

16:46.870 --> 16:49.407
- Big Ronnie here say

16:51.000 --> 16:52.365
It's all good though.

16:52.410 --> 16:54.196
It's going down Saturday night.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.536

You feel me?

16:56.620 --> 16:59.032

16:59.120 --> 17:02.112

18:43.660 --> 18:45.651

Got 'em runnin_' around
With choppers like we at

19:23.080 --> 19:24.991

They came at us 'cause

19:38.000 --> 19:39.865
It ain't about turf no more.

19:39.910 --> 19:42.652
They want us to come at 'em.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.157
And we doing
exactly what they want.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.446
-You told Touie.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.991
Remember?

19:56.080 --> 19:59.902
You told him,
"This the life we been given."

20:02.580 --> 20:04.571
This our home, baby.

20:04.620 --> 20:08.613
This neighborhood,
this where we raise our family.

20:13.620 --> 20:16.657
Okay, look, you really think
this thing you got is gonna

20:16.700 --> 20:18.907
make a difference for us?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.536
For our family?

20:20.580 --> 20:23.401
-It's just gonna take
some time, baby.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.695
-All right.

20:25.790 --> 20:27.655
All right.

20:31.450 --> 20:33.498
But until that happens...

20:35.790 --> 20:38.281
if Jey tell you
to pick up that chopper

20:38.330 --> 20:41.493
and cut down them
Overtown niggas
that killed Joelle,

20:41.540 --> 20:46.364
that killed Jules, that turned
this whole place upside down...

20:46.410 --> 20:48.696
then you gonna do
how you do.

21:08.330 --> 21:11.197
-Mm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:11.290 --> 21:12.826
Yeah.

21:12.870 --> 21:15.327
Mm. Mm.

21:15.330 --> 21:17.992
--I like the chocolate more.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.992
-Yeah, but see, Adolfito,
the ice cream goes much better

21:21.080 --> 21:24.152
with the plain vanilla cake.
-Yeah, yeah, I agree with Mom.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.829
-Then why aren't
we doing the vanilla?
-Oh, we are, Dad.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.906
-Then why are you having
me eat all these?

21:34.160 --> 21:36.651
-I like that one too,
Mr. Morales.
-Oh, come on.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.907
-See, I knew there was
a reason I liked this guy.

21:40.330 --> 21:42.651
-Okay, taste this, mija.
-No thanks, Mom. I'm okay.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.497
-No, baby, you're the bride.
You gotta taste it.

21:44.540 --> 21:46.360
-I know, but I gotta
lose three more pounds.
-What?

21:46.410 --> 21:49.652
- No, you don't baby.
Now, now, now
wait a minute, corazon.

21:49.700 --> 21:52.863
You look perfect.

21:52.950 --> 21:55.578
- Thanks, Dad.
Hey, baby,
escucha. Listen.

21:55.620 --> 21:57.281
Let me tell you
something, okay?

21:57.330 --> 22:00.151
I gained weight
before our wedding.

22:00.250 --> 22:01.399
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.657
Eating my worries.

22:06.910 --> 22:11.609
-I couldn't wait to marry
my perfect, delicious man.

22:11.660 --> 22:13.196
- Mm.
- Oh, my god.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.820
Think I need
a sundae after that.

22:14.870 --> 22:17.612
- Ven, papi.
- Ya aca.

22:17.660 --> 22:19.070
-Ay esta.

22:19.120 --> 22:23.864
-Do you girls remember
when we used to make these? Hm?

22:23.910 --> 22:27.038
-A little.
-Oh, it had to be perfect.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.036
Delfi was insistent on it.

22:29.120 --> 22:31.497
-Mm-hmm.
-A perfectionist.

22:31.540 --> 22:33.496
-Yeah, that's true.
-Like her mother.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.992
No, no, she needed the chocolate
to be a certain temperature.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.321
- That was bad.

22:39.410 --> 22:43.289
-The bananas to be
perfectly ripe.

22:43.330 --> 22:46.743
And those cherries.
You remember those cherries.

22:46.790 --> 22:49.441
-Yes, Dad, I remember
the cherries.

22:49.500 --> 22:52.537
-The ones we could only buy
at Rosa's Market.

22:52.580 --> 22:56.619
-Ay, Rosa's. It was so sad
that they closed, no?

22:56.660 --> 22:58.651
-Oh, I remember that one night,

22:58.700 --> 23:00.907
Delfi's 11th birthday
I think it was,

23:00.950 --> 23:02.998
Mom was running
around like crazy

23:03.000 --> 23:04.865
trying to get ready
for your party,

23:04.910 --> 23:06.491
and she didn't have time
to go to Rosa's,

23:06.500 --> 23:09.867
so she just bought
some regular old cherries.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.446
-Yeah, I remember, Dad.

23:11.500 --> 23:14.651
--We||, Delfi threw
quite a fit.

23:16.330 --> 23:19.652
"It has to be these cherries!"
-Oh, my god. Dad!

23:19.750 --> 23:22.742
It's true!

23:22.790 --> 23:26.112
- And your sister,
you know what she did?
What?

23:26.160 --> 23:28.401
She broke open her piggy bank,

23:28.450 --> 23:31.078
rode her bike
to Rosa's Market,

23:31.120 --> 23:34.408
and bought them
for you herself.

23:34.450 --> 23:36.441
-I don't remember that part.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.900
-Oh, she did.

23:38.950 --> 23:41.828
She's always looked out
for you in her own way.

23:41.870 --> 23:45.328
And she looks out
for all of us.

23:45.370 --> 23:48.328
But you always had
the story wrong.
Really?

23:48.370 --> 23:50.861
-I didn't buy the cherries.
I stole them.

23:53.330 --> 23:54.991
That's hilarious.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.820
-It's not a joke.

24:01.160 --> 24:05.324
-Hey, 122,
your gringo's here.
-Hm?

24:07.830 --> 24:09.821
-Why are you just
standing out there?

24:09.870 --> 24:13.283
Oye, ask him if he wants
to try the cake.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.281
-What are you doing here?

24:16.330 --> 24:20.198
What? No, they're just
working on a project together.

24:23.040 --> 24:25.076
A little cake, mami.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.191
It's true.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.827
-1.5 million.

24:54.870 --> 24:57.532
-I'm sorry? I didn't hear.
I didn't hear you.

24:57.580 --> 24:59.536
-What did you do,
give him head?

24:59.580 --> 25:02.117
-What did I do?
What didn't I do?

25:02.160 --> 25:05.072
I persevered.
-I like your style.

25:07.660 --> 25:10.823
-I like my style too.

25:10.870 --> 25:14.658
-You don't know how
to give high fives, but that's--
-How do you give high fives?

25:14.700 --> 25:17.692
-Yeah, don't--
-I was doing more
of a soul thing.

25:17.790 --> 25:19.997
-No, you were doing a hand hug.
-Yeah.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.615
-Let's go celebrate.

25:21.660 --> 25:23.537
-Yeah? What do you
want to do?

25:23.620 --> 25:25.827
Transfer a lot of money
to GenCoin?

25:25.830 --> 25:26.990
-Yeah.

25:30.290 --> 25:32.906
-I want it in and then
I want to get blackout drunk.

25:39.790 --> 25:42.190
You're real humble.
You know like,
you know,

25:42.250 --> 25:44.241
I feel like some it, you know,
I feel like this warrants it.

25:44.290 --> 25:46.656
-Okay. You totally said it
yourself. Let's go celebrate.

25:46.700 --> 25:48.247
-Okay.
-Okay.

25:48.290 --> 25:50.906
-So 1.5. And that's what
a celebration looks like.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.571
- Let's go!

26:10.660 --> 26:13.151
-You know what this means?
We have a true first-in now.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.242
Someone-- He's very public,
he's legitimate,

26:15.290 --> 26:17.281
he's got a great reputation
in the business community.

26:17.330 --> 26:19.286
Everyone's gonna see it
and they're gonna want it.

26:19.330 --> 26:22.322
It's gonna be a windfall.
Just watch. Just watch.

26:29.580 --> 26:31.571
-Speaking of legit,
what about Ronald?

26:31.660 --> 26:32.991
-What about him?

26:33.000 --> 26:34.490
-Do we still need him?

26:34.540 --> 26:36.246
-You're cold blooded.
-No!

26:36.330 --> 26:38.150
-You're fucking cold blooded,
and INlike it.
- o.

26:38.160 --> 26:40.196
-And we absolutely
don't need him now.
-But you like it!

26:40.290 --> 26:42.360
-We have the seed money
and he's dangerous.

26:42.450 --> 26:44.691
-So, let's give him
his money back and that's it.
-I don't think

26:44.790 --> 26:46.326
he would take kindly to that.

26:46.370 --> 26:47.496
I wish it was that simple.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.400
I mean, yeah,
he's a huge liability.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.490
But he can also kill us.

26:52.500 --> 26:55.822
-I mean, at this point,
you think he's gonna kill us?

27:01.330 --> 27:02.536
-No.

27:10.540 --> 27:12.360
-Hey. Um...

27:12.410 --> 27:14.822
I'm sorry. You weren't
picking up your phone.

27:14.870 --> 27:16.155
-Mm.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.651
-I found something. Can I...

27:18.700 --> 27:20.076
-Please.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.287
-I was going through
the second batch of that SAR.

27:22.330 --> 27:25.652
-Mm.
-The off-shore shell corps that
the money was pulled from.

27:25.700 --> 27:27.998
-Mm-hmm.
-Isabe||e Morales opened
each one of them

27:28.040 --> 27:29.325
at exactly
the same time.

27:29.330 --> 27:31.446
-Yeah, I know.
I looked into that too.

27:31.500 --> 27:33.821
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.

27:33.910 --> 27:36.743
-Why didn't you--
-'Cause she didn't
break the law.

27:36.790 --> 27:39.532
She opened
the shell corps legitimately.

27:39.580 --> 27:41.320
Yes, they're for
harboring investments,

27:41.370 --> 27:43.907
but it's all legal
and she even pays taxes on them.

27:45.250 --> 27:46.569
-Really?
-Really.

27:46.620 --> 27:48.690
I thought the same thing
too though.

27:50.790 --> 27:52.155
-Hm.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.862
-Hm. Drink?

27:54.910 --> 27:56.821
-Oh, no.
You're going to bed.

27:56.870 --> 27:59.156
-No, believe me,
I'm gonna be up late. It's fine.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.365
-Okay.
-Wine okay?

28:03.450 --> 28:04.860
-Maybe just coffee.

28:04.950 --> 28:07.032
What? It's 10:00.

28:07.120 --> 28:10.658
-Doesn't affect me.
I'll still pass out
in an hour.

28:10.700 --> 28:13.077
-Oh. Well, cafecito?

28:13.120 --> 28:15.998
-You can make those here?
-I'll show you.
