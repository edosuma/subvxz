00:55.158 --> 00:58.457
Oh, yeah, nice to see you.

01:01.431 --> 01:05.060
Hey, that dress needs dry-cleaning.

01:05.235 --> 01:09.035
- Here you go.
- Thank you kindly, Monica.

01:09.272 --> 01:11.240
Monica? Monica?

01:11.408 --> 01:13.876
Oh, shit, Hillary.

01:17.948 --> 01:19.916
Okay.

01:20.083 --> 01:21.311
Hi, Bill.

01:21.484 --> 01:23.748
Oh, hey, Snow White.

01:24.788 --> 01:26.915
Where is 11 B?

01:27.891 --> 01:29.916
Bingo.

01:30.293 --> 01:32.853
Where did she say that thing was?

01:34.698 --> 01:36.666
Guess it's time for a little action.

01:40.670 --> 01:42.160
Monica.

01:42.339 --> 01:43.966
It's Bill.

01:44.140 --> 01:46.540
I got some dictation for you, Monica.

01:47.110 --> 01:49.943
I got a big secret for you, baby.

01:50.113 --> 01:52.877
How did you get up here so soon?

01:56.653 --> 01:59.850
Monica. Monica.

02:04.060 --> 02:05.425
Wait!

02:06.630 --> 02:07.688
I can't see.

02:08.965 --> 02:11.525
My eyes! My eyes! I can't see!

02:11.701 --> 02:13.134
Who let you in?

02:15.038 --> 02:17.563
What happened? Where's Monica?
What happened to Monica?

02:17.741 --> 02:19.106
How did you get in here?

02:19.276 --> 02:21.244
She told me where the key was.
I can't see.

02:21.411 --> 02:23.675
Did she say it was okay
to dry hump her roommate?

02:23.847 --> 02:26.475
She said you'd be in the library
because you're a geek.

02:26.650 --> 02:28.914
I am not a geek. Gosh.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.111
Oh, my God. What was that, Mace?

02:33.623 --> 02:36.820
Eternity by Calvin Klein.

02:40.964 --> 02:44.331
Oh, I'm gonna be so careful
who I get in bed with from now on.

02:45.869 --> 02:48.599
That'd be a big adjustment for you,
wouldn't it?

02:50.573 --> 02:52.040
God.

02:54.277 --> 02:55.938
I do that every time.

02:56.112 --> 02:58.910
I've invented a solution for that.
Seriously.

02:59.282 --> 03:02.410
It's something goes around a coffee
cup so you don't burn your hand.

03:02.585 --> 03:05.247
I'm gonna call it the coffee collar.
Brilliant idea.

03:05.422 --> 03:07.447
I know all about you.
I know your whole rap.

03:07.624 --> 03:09.615
- You do?
- Yeah. You're a senior...

03:10.293 --> 03:13.285
...who preys on freshmen.
You slept with half my floor.

03:14.297 --> 03:17.198
- Well, half your floor was female.
- Whatever.

03:18.134 --> 03:21.103
And you once met Bono,
which I suspect is total bullshit.

03:21.271 --> 03:24.707
No, it's true. He signed my CD.
It's upstairs in my room...

03:24.874 --> 03:27.741
...with my coffee collar
if you wanna see it.

03:29.245 --> 03:30.507
Are you hitting on me?

03:30.680 --> 03:32.511
No. I'm going off your look.

03:32.682 --> 03:35.207
- My look.
- Yeah. Your "doggy bowl" look.

03:36.386 --> 03:39.219
- Are you calling me a dog?
- No, it's a theory I have.

03:39.389 --> 03:40.754
Oh, Casanova has a theory.

03:40.924 --> 03:44.416
When a girl's attracted to a guy,
she has a look. It's her tell, like poker.

03:44.594 --> 03:47.722
It's the same look a dog gets
right before you put down the bowl.

03:47.897 --> 03:50.695
You're offensive. And you're crazy.

03:50.867 --> 03:53.131
I'm honest.
I believe honesty is the best policy.

03:53.303 --> 03:55.794
All right.
You want me to be honest with you?

03:55.972 --> 03:57.200
Sure.

03:57.374 --> 03:59.035
- I'm majoring in Fine Art.
- Right.

03:59.209 --> 04:02.201
I'm studying the golden proportions
of the human face.

04:02.379 --> 04:04.677
Your nose is bent,
it droops down at the bottom...

04:04.848 --> 04:07.373
...a feature accentuated
by the thinness of your lip.

04:07.550 --> 04:09.415
And your eyes are too far apart...

04:09.586 --> 04:12.111
...but they'd have to be
to accommodate that bent nose.

04:12.288 --> 04:14.756
I feel sorry for you.
You have to validate yourself...

04:14.924 --> 04:17.358
...through insatiable,
meaningless, ego sport-sex...

04:17.527 --> 04:19.358
...with insecure girls
like my roommate.

04:19.529 --> 04:22.089
I would never have sex
with someone...

04:23.133 --> 04:24.600
...like you.

04:27.871 --> 04:29.566
Hey, come here.

04:29.739 --> 04:31.536
That was amazing.

04:31.708 --> 04:33.039
- What was?
- The honesty.

04:33.209 --> 04:35.336
That was almost better than sex
without the...

04:35.512 --> 04:38.140
- Without the crying.
- Actually, it did feel pretty good.

04:38.314 --> 04:40.612
- No one's been that honest.
- It's called a friend.

04:40.784 --> 04:42.046
I'm Tom, by the way.

04:42.218 --> 04:44.550
- Hannah.
- Hannah. That's a palindrome.

04:46.289 --> 04:47.551
Good night.

04:48.258 --> 04:49.725
Good night.

04:51.194 --> 04:53.185
Your hand's clammy.

04:53.363 --> 04:55.354
I can see through your nightgown.

04:59.402 --> 05:01.233
Tom, is that you?

05:01.404 --> 05:04.396
Can I see your Bono autograph?

05:10.246 --> 05:12.976
She's all yours, friend.

05:14.084 --> 05:17.178
Monica, get some sleep.

05:59.796 --> 06:01.320
Good morning.

06:39.469 --> 06:41.130
Who is this?

06:42.705 --> 06:44.468
Oh, I'm late.

06:46.943 --> 06:48.501
What are you doing tonight?

06:49.679 --> 06:51.806
I don't do back-to-backs.

06:55.718 --> 06:57.583
Isn't that what we were doing
last night?

06:57.754 --> 07:01.212
No, that was something different.
Back-to-backs are seeing each other...

07:01.391 --> 07:03.484
...two nights in a row. I don't do that.

07:03.660 --> 07:05.924
Couldn't you just
break one of your stupid rules?

07:06.095 --> 07:07.323
- No.
- For me?

07:07.497 --> 07:10.159
I'm sorry. I don't break the rules.

07:11.701 --> 07:13.498
I have a rule about that.

07:15.271 --> 07:17.000
See you next week.

08:04.187 --> 08:05.620
Thank you.

08:05.788 --> 08:07.050
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

08:08.925 --> 08:10.756
Can I get a grande drip...

08:10.927 --> 08:12.588
...and a decaf, triple grande...

08:12.762 --> 08:15.458
...nonfat, extra-hot, stirred,
no-foam Caramel Macchiato...

08:15.632 --> 08:17.532
...with whipped cream,
extra caramel?

08:17.700 --> 08:21.397
And fill that 70 percent of the way.
Thank you.

08:25.875 --> 08:28.537
Oh, here. Let me put a coffee collar
on that for you.

08:28.711 --> 08:29.735
Oh, thank you.

08:29.912 --> 08:32.437
I hear the guy that invented that
gets a dime for each.

08:32.615 --> 08:34.947
- You're kidding.
- I am not.

08:35.318 --> 08:37.149
That could add up.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.311
Oh, I think I picked up yours
by accident.

08:39.489 --> 08:41.753
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right. Thank you.

08:41.924 --> 08:43.049
Anytime.

08:44.227 --> 08:45.819
Bye-bye.

08:52.802 --> 08:54.565
"Gloria."

09:40.817 --> 09:42.216
Morning.

09:42.919 --> 09:46.377
Good morning, Hannah.
Coffee the way you like it.

09:46.622 --> 09:49.318
Perfect timing.
I just finished working on his balls.

09:50.126 --> 09:53.892
That's... Yeah. Good.
So I made a reservation.

09:54.630 --> 09:56.928
- <i>So which rule is this?</i>
- <i>No back-to-backs.</i>

09:57.867 --> 10:00.495
Isn't it the same as
the "no more than once a week" rule?

10:00.670 --> 10:02.865
The once a week rule works
Monday to Friday...

10:03.039 --> 10:06.167
You could have a date on Sunday
and then Monday without breaking it.

10:06.342 --> 10:07.900
- Exactly, you got it.
- Of course.

10:08.077 --> 10:10.272
Here we go. Hey, good morning.

10:10.446 --> 10:12.107
Can I get the steamed buns...

10:12.281 --> 10:14.112
...the scalloped
steamed dumplings...

10:14.283 --> 10:17.081
...and the vegetarian
and shrimp steamed dumplings.

10:17.253 --> 10:18.311
- Thank you.
- For what?

10:18.488 --> 10:21.616
You know how much I love
the fried stuff. You're looking after me.

10:22.492 --> 10:24.153
Excellent. So what did she say?

10:24.327 --> 10:25.919
She was hurt, but at least I was...

10:26.095 --> 10:30.225
- But you were honest, weren't you?
- What? I was. I am. Always.

10:30.400 --> 10:34.564
I know you are, but it's just shocking
how you use it as a shield.

10:34.737 --> 10:37.035
Maybe I should lie.
Be more like Dennis Phillips.

10:37.206 --> 10:38.833
Say whatever
to get a woman in bed.

10:39.008 --> 10:41.943
Do not be like Dennis Phillips.
He's so gross.

10:42.111 --> 10:44.909
- He only hit on you once.
- At my father's funeral.

10:45.381 --> 10:47.246
Okay, he's not known
for his sensitivity.

10:47.417 --> 10:50.079
Oh, God. Anyways...

10:50.753 --> 10:52.015
What?

10:52.455 --> 10:53.945
Nothing.

10:54.524 --> 10:57.049
I know that "nothing."
It's something. Anyway?

10:57.226 --> 11:00.855
Anyway, we both know you don't
need to lie to get a woman into bed.

11:01.030 --> 11:04.090
Gloria. I don't wanna lose that.
Can I keep it? Thank you.

11:04.267 --> 11:05.996
Here's another rule too:
24-hour rule.

11:06.169 --> 11:09.536
I can't call her for another 24 hours.
Then it appears I'm too desperate.

11:09.705 --> 11:11.002
Yeah, right.

11:11.274 --> 11:13.037
You know,
Dan sent me another letter.

11:13.209 --> 11:15.336
Asking you to move to Canada
and marry him?

11:15.511 --> 11:16.978
A slice of apple-crumb pie.

11:17.146 --> 11:18.841
No. Got that last time.

11:19.015 --> 11:21.449
- You guys broke up like a year ago.
- Nineteen months.

11:21.617 --> 11:25.178
- You're counting?
- No, he is. It was in the letter.

11:25.354 --> 11:27.117
Lemon, butter-cream cup.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.986
Not feeling the cream cup today.

11:30.159 --> 11:31.387
Cranberry-orange muffin?

11:31.561 --> 11:33.688
Oh, Hannah, come on.
You're losing it.

11:33.863 --> 11:36.855
- I know, I know. Okay, okay.
- They don't have it here. Forget it.

11:37.033 --> 11:39.558
- Come on. You're disappointing me.
- I got it. I got it.

11:39.735 --> 11:41.498
Okay, I so have it, I so have it.

11:41.671 --> 11:44.003
Cream-cheese-swirl brownie.

11:44.874 --> 11:47.468
You're so good.

11:52.081 --> 11:55.278
What do you think of this?
I think we should bring them this.

11:55.451 --> 11:59.114
Tom, I'm not going to another one
of your father's weddings.

11:59.388 --> 12:02.016
Thank you. Hannah? Please.

12:02.191 --> 12:04.455
Take one of the girls
you've been rubbing against.

12:04.627 --> 12:06.094
No weddings or family events.

12:06.262 --> 12:07.991
That's right. I forgot that rule.

12:08.164 --> 12:10.962
- Leaves the wrong impression.
- It does.

12:13.769 --> 12:16.966
- Is this made with real alligator?
- Yes, baby alligator.

12:17.473 --> 12:19.907
You should be ashamed of yourself.

12:21.477 --> 12:22.501
Look at you.

12:22.678 --> 12:26.375
Hello there. Hello there.
Aren't you beautiful?

12:26.549 --> 12:29.040
Oh, I love you. Yes, I do, I love you.

12:29.218 --> 12:31.550
You're so pretty. Yes, you are.
You're beautiful.

12:31.721 --> 12:34.713
You're beautiful. You're so beautiful.
Look at that face.

12:34.891 --> 12:36.256
Love you, love you, love you.

12:36.425 --> 12:38.552
You should try saying that
to a human sometime.

12:38.728 --> 12:39.956
What?

12:40.129 --> 12:43.462
A human?
You don't say that to a human.

12:43.633 --> 12:45.328
You're sweet. Love you.

12:45.902 --> 12:47.802
Hannah, please.
Come to the wedding.

12:47.970 --> 12:49.904
- No.
- He gets married and I go.

12:50.072 --> 12:52.802
I go because he's my father
and I care deeply for the man.

12:52.975 --> 12:54.636
Everybody knows
he doesn't love them.

12:54.810 --> 12:56.471
They don't love him. It's pathetic.

12:56.646 --> 12:58.910
Breaks my heart.
I don't know what to say.

12:59.081 --> 13:02.448
If someone's making a mistake and
it's not your place to interfere, say:

13:02.618 --> 13:03.778
"I'm happy you're happy."

13:03.953 --> 13:05.784
- "I'm happy you're happy."
- Yeah.

13:05.955 --> 13:08.185
Okay. I'll do that.

13:08.891 --> 13:11.883
I promise you, this is the last time
I'll ask you to come.

13:12.061 --> 13:14.996
And then I'll find somebody else
to come for the next few.

13:15.164 --> 13:17.655
Hannah, please.

13:20.036 --> 13:21.731
That's cute.

13:23.439 --> 13:26.772
- Last time.
- Thank you. Thank you.

13:38.854 --> 13:41.789
Look, she gets the apartment
in the city and 30 grand a month.

13:41.958 --> 13:44.620
Right. Okay, okay.
You get the house in the Hamptons.

13:44.794 --> 13:47.354
She's asking for the apartment
in the city and 30 grand.

13:47.530 --> 13:50.090
- Thirty? But...
- Are you still negotiating the prenup?

13:50.266 --> 13:53.963
- Now the party starts, my son is here.
- You're getting married in 10 minutes.

13:54.136 --> 13:56.730
Dad, Dad, please. I can't breathe.
Dad. Please, Dad.

13:57.773 --> 13:59.866
- Did you bring the lovely Hannah?
- Yes, I did.

14:00.042 --> 14:02.306
You don't act on that,
you know what I'm gonna do?

14:02.478 --> 14:04.673
- No.
- I'm gonna make her my number six.

14:06.148 --> 14:07.945
It's seven. This is number six.

14:09.251 --> 14:11.515
- Yeah.
- My God, you are pretty.

14:11.687 --> 14:13.587
Oh, Dad...

14:13.756 --> 14:15.348
I used to be that pretty once.

14:15.524 --> 14:17.355
Dennis, look how pretty my boy is.

14:17.526 --> 14:20.620
He's beautiful. They won't accept
a minimum of five times a week.

14:20.796 --> 14:22.354
She promised five, I want five.

14:22.531 --> 14:24.829
What did she promise you
five times a week?

14:25.334 --> 14:27.131
- Four times?
- Two.

14:27.303 --> 14:29.771
No, no, no. We're not done yet.
We're not done yet.

14:30.506 --> 14:33.475
- Three with a bimonthly BJ.
- Oh, this is disturbing.

14:34.110 --> 14:36.544
- Four, and make it weekly.
- Wait, wait, wait. Don't...

14:36.712 --> 14:39.306
Driver, go around the block.
We are not even close.

14:39.482 --> 14:40.744
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:40.916 --> 14:43.942
- What was that?
- Christie, wait. Christie.

14:44.887 --> 14:46.252
- Come on.
- Okay. Okay.

14:46.422 --> 14:48.413
Come on, tell me.
Say what you gotta say.

14:48.591 --> 14:50.957
Well, I'm happy if you're happy.

14:51.127 --> 14:53.561
"You're too old for her, Dad.
She doesn't love you.

14:53.729 --> 14:56.630
This is embarrassing. You're gonna
rack up your fifth divorce."

14:56.799 --> 14:58.357
- Sixth.
- Sixth.

15:00.302 --> 15:03.396
- Come on, I'm happy if you're happy.
- Bullshit.

15:03.572 --> 15:05.563
They'll go for four
if you exercise more.

15:05.741 --> 15:07.470
You can't gain any more weight.

15:07.643 --> 15:08.701
- Take it. Deal.
- Deal.

15:08.878 --> 15:11.813
I told her I weighed 10 pounds more
than I do. Ain't love grand?

15:11.981 --> 15:13.812
- Sign them both.
- What's he signing now?

15:13.983 --> 15:17.180
- Current prenup and his last divorce.
- That's just great.

15:17.353 --> 15:19.913
You look great, don't fix it.
Come on.

15:20.089 --> 15:21.283
- You're good.
- Move.

15:21.457 --> 15:22.583
- I'm so excited.
- Yeah.

15:22.758 --> 15:23.884
Thank you.

15:24.060 --> 15:25.721
I'm so excited.

16:05.201 --> 16:07.260
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16:08.637 --> 16:11.731
- Did you tell your dad you loved him?
- I told him I cared for him.

16:11.907 --> 16:14.933
You can't even tell your father.
I don't get that.

16:15.111 --> 16:17.602
- It's a guy thing.
- No, it's a Tom thing.

16:17.780 --> 16:20.715
Oh, well, you're an "I love you" slut.

16:21.550 --> 16:22.608
Are you kidding me?

16:22.785 --> 16:25.253
You say it all the time, to everybody.

16:25.421 --> 16:28.049
- Oh, this looks so good.
- That looks good. What is that?

16:28.224 --> 16:31.091
Lemon. I should've ordered this.
This looks good.

16:31.260 --> 16:33.091
You always order better than I do.

16:35.898 --> 16:38.890
It's lemon, right? It's good.
I'm ordering that from now on.

16:39.068 --> 16:40.194
- No, you won't.
- Why?

16:40.369 --> 16:43.031
I need you to order the chocolate cake
so I can have some.

16:43.205 --> 16:45.070
There's my son.

16:45.241 --> 16:46.572
Here we go.

16:46.742 --> 16:48.801
- Hi.
- Christie. How are you?

16:48.978 --> 16:51.276
If you're a bad boy,
I'm gonna spank you.

16:51.447 --> 16:54.644
Yeah. Do you know what
I would like to say to you? Is that...

16:55.684 --> 16:58.517
- I want you to listen to me, Tom.
- Yes.

16:58.687 --> 17:01.053
If you need any moneys...

17:01.223 --> 17:03.384
...or you need any advice...
- Right.

17:03.559 --> 17:06.528
...or you got girl problems.
I don't think...

17:07.163 --> 17:10.859
I need you to think of me
how you would a real mother.

17:11.367 --> 17:12.857
Yeah, that's exactly what l...

17:13.035 --> 17:14.627
- Look at this beauty.
- There he is.

17:14.804 --> 17:16.362
Hello, sweetie.

17:17.173 --> 17:19.266
Drunk as the night I first met her.

17:21.210 --> 17:23.701
- So romantic.
- Oh, please. By all means.

17:23.878 --> 17:26.211
- You are a bad influence on her.
- Me?

17:26.382 --> 17:27.508
Last shot, okay?

17:28.450 --> 17:30.975
- I'm stealing you away.
- "The last one."

17:31.554 --> 17:33.681
He does know
that he can just date, right?

17:35.057 --> 17:36.888
No, I don't think he does.

17:38.327 --> 17:41.387
- To mothers.
- To mothers. Cheers.

17:43.866 --> 17:45.299
Careful.

17:46.268 --> 17:47.394
Oh, nice.

17:57.646 --> 17:59.238
Oh, God.

17:59.415 --> 18:01.007
- Hide me.
- What?

18:01.183 --> 18:02.810
It's my dad's patient coordinator.

18:03.419 --> 18:06.752
Don't look, don't look. Don't look.
No, no. She's obsessed with me.

18:07.089 --> 18:09.819
Yeah, she's created a website
called AllThingsTom.org.

18:10.392 --> 18:12.553
- The psycho blogger?
- Yes.

18:12.728 --> 18:14.923
Okay, come on.
Dance with me. Watch yourself.

18:15.097 --> 18:16.655
- I think she's cute.
- Stop it.

18:16.832 --> 18:18.697
- I'm serious.
- Just keep going.

18:20.502 --> 18:21.560
Here, just...

18:21.737 --> 18:25.571
Hide me. Up. Neck, neck, neck.
Up. Back. Side, side. Go. Over.

18:28.611 --> 18:31.705
Her last blog was
a two-page description of my face.

18:31.881 --> 18:35.373
You see, she doesn't think my nose
is too bent or my lips are too thin.

18:35.551 --> 18:38.418
- Who said that?
- You did. When we met.

18:38.587 --> 18:40.987
- Well, I lied.
- What?

18:42.625 --> 18:44.593
I thought you were hot.

18:45.728 --> 18:47.525
Well, you told me
I looked like a dog.

18:47.696 --> 18:50.221
That's because
I was just trying to sleep with you.

18:50.399 --> 18:52.299
Why haven't you since?

18:53.936 --> 18:57.167
Well, I like having you in my life.

18:57.339 --> 18:58.363
Funny.

18:58.540 --> 18:59.734
- Hi, Tom.
- Oh, hi.

18:59.909 --> 19:02.434
- Did you see the new blog?
- No, we haven't.

19:03.012 --> 19:04.377
- Who's this?
- This?

19:04.546 --> 19:06.377
Well, this is my... My girlfriend.

19:07.383 --> 19:09.510
Why didn't you tell me
you were seeing someone?

19:09.685 --> 19:13.086
- Because I don't know you.
- We have a really open relationship.

19:13.255 --> 19:14.279
Really?

19:14.456 --> 19:16.651
I wanted to talk to you
about that, princess.

19:16.825 --> 19:19.225
I don't wanna be with anybody
but you.

19:19.395 --> 19:22.592
I don't know if I'm really quite ready
to make that commitment.

19:22.765 --> 19:24.892
You know my rules.

19:25.067 --> 19:27.126
- We're a bit of an emotional retard.
- Yeah.

19:28.170 --> 19:30.070
I think I need to start
a new blog now.

19:32.007 --> 19:33.304
That is so scary.

19:33.475 --> 19:36.467
She's psychotic on top of being...
Oh, this is not good.

19:47.723 --> 19:49.281
Get out of my way.

19:49.458 --> 19:52.359
Okay, good, she's gone.
Perfect. Let's go.

19:52.528 --> 19:55.361
Good, come on. What?

19:57.566 --> 19:59.659
Do you remember that home
in Scotland...

19:59.835 --> 20:01.769
...with those paintings
I told you about?

20:01.937 --> 20:04.405
- It's all I think about.
- Stop it, Tom.

20:04.573 --> 20:08.304
I got the board to sign off on making
them additions to our collection.

20:08.477 --> 20:09.739
Really?

20:09.912 --> 20:12.972
But they want me to go to Scotland
for an acquisitions trip.

20:13.148 --> 20:14.615
- When do you go?
- Couple of days.

20:14.783 --> 20:16.273
Couple of days? For how long?

20:16.452 --> 20:18.181
Six weeks.

20:18.354 --> 20:20.288
That's a long time.

20:20.889 --> 20:23.221
- That's great.
- You think?

20:23.392 --> 20:26.122
Yes,
it's a great opportunity for you.

20:26.295 --> 20:28.763
You're like the museum maven
of the Met.

20:30.833 --> 20:33.233
It's got a good ring to it.

20:33.702 --> 20:37.160
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

20:39.308 --> 20:41.367
Six Sundays.

20:42.978 --> 20:44.104
That is six Sundays.

20:44.279 --> 20:48.875
- What am I gonna do without you?
- Oh, well. I can just imagine.

20:49.651 --> 20:51.585
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

20:51.754 --> 20:53.984
- I'm gonna jump!
- No. God. Jesus.

20:54.156 --> 20:56.488
Six Sundays.
How can I live without you?

20:56.658 --> 20:59.252
- Can you not take anything seriously?
- Yeah, I can.

20:59.428 --> 21:00.952
Get down.

21:01.130 --> 21:04.964
- Let's get you another drink.
- I think I've had too many already.

21:05.134 --> 21:06.795
Oh, thanks for coming
to the wedding.

21:06.969 --> 21:09.028
It was a ball.
I can't wait for number seven.

21:09.204 --> 21:11.195
It's coming up soon,
I have a feeling.

21:11.874 --> 21:15.742
<i>We also ask at this time that you</i>
<i>turn off all your electronic devices.</i>

21:15.911 --> 21:19.608
<i>Please leave your cell phones turned</i>
<i>off for the full duration of the flight.</i>

21:35.764 --> 21:38.232
I'm not gonna be able
to play today, man. My back.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.494
If we don't have a fourth, we're gonna
end up with Tiny Shorts Guy.

21:41.670 --> 21:43.069
- How's it going?
- Need another?

21:43.238 --> 21:46.002
No, our friend Paul,
with longer shorts, is coming.

21:46.175 --> 21:48.370
No, Ginny signed him up
for some art-walk thing.

21:48.544 --> 21:50.205
Art walk? Are you serious? Tell me:

21:50.379 --> 21:52.370
What do you think Ginny did
with his balls?

21:52.548 --> 21:54.482
Come on, guys.
Marriage isn't that bad.

21:54.650 --> 21:56.515
Without marriage,
there'd be no divorce.

21:56.685 --> 21:59.017
Without divorce,
I wouldn't have my condo in Aspen.

21:59.188 --> 22:00.655
There you go.

22:01.390 --> 22:03.017
- Good one.
- What is he? What is he?

22:03.192 --> 22:06.093
I'm serious, man. You're missing out
on the best parts of life.

22:06.261 --> 22:07.751
The most important part of life.

22:07.930 --> 22:10.330
This from the guy
whose wife won't let him own porn.

22:10.499 --> 22:13.434
He's gotta wank off to the underwear
of the Sears catalogue.

22:13.602 --> 22:16.366
I thought we weren't
gonna talk about that, huh?

22:16.538 --> 22:19.598
What's the matter with you?
You're single and been single since...

22:19.775 --> 22:22.141
What was her name,
in sophomore year?

22:22.311 --> 22:23.778
Pimkin. Pimkin, that's it.

22:23.946 --> 22:26.039
Pimkin dumped you for him
sophomore year.

22:26.215 --> 22:28.911
You've never been the same.
You haven't been able to sleep.

22:29.084 --> 22:32.144
- Scarred.
- You have no idea how nice it is...

22:32.321 --> 22:35.688
...to have someone who's gonna be
there for you, no matter what, forever.

22:35.858 --> 22:37.018
Snaps to that.

22:37.192 --> 22:40.218
You don't know how nice it is to
sleep with a different girl.

22:40.395 --> 22:41.794
That's true.

22:41.964 --> 22:43.022
Nice rebuttal.

22:44.032 --> 22:46.364
You know, you got the best
of both worlds, Tom.

22:46.535 --> 22:48.696
It's true.
I can sleep with whoever I want...

22:48.871 --> 22:51.840
...but I still get to hang with Hannah.
It's a perfect setup.

22:52.007 --> 22:54.168
- Well, maybe not for Hannah.
- What's that mean?

22:54.476 --> 22:56.034
Come on, Tom. She's a woman.

22:56.211 --> 22:58.202
- Yeah, I got that.
- You sure?

22:58.380 --> 22:59.938
Dude, she's pushing 30.

23:00.382 --> 23:02.475
You think her idea
of happily ever after...

23:02.651 --> 23:05.950
...is coming home to you
and hanging out after you got laid?

23:06.121 --> 23:08.954
- Makes you think, right?
- Yeah.

23:19.401 --> 23:20.925
- Hello?
- Hey.

23:21.103 --> 23:22.900
- <i>Hi.</i>
- How's the weather in England?

23:23.505 --> 23:26.372
It's great. Only I'm in Scotland.

23:26.542 --> 23:29.534
Oh, right. Right.

23:29.711 --> 23:30.735
So it's sunny.

23:33.715 --> 23:34.909
It's 3 in the morning.

23:35.083 --> 23:37.881
- <i>Oh, right. Sorry. So it's dark.</i>
- Yeah.

23:38.387 --> 23:41.185
Hey, have you seen
the Loch Ness monster yet?

23:42.057 --> 23:43.649
<i>I know, terrible joke. Anyway...</i>

23:43.825 --> 23:45.349
Is there something important?

23:45.527 --> 23:47.392
Yeah, you'll never guess
what happened.

23:47.563 --> 23:49.224
- <i>What?</i>
- They filled in the pothole.

23:49.398 --> 23:52.561
- The pothole?
- <i>On 83rd.</i>

23:52.734 --> 23:54.725
Terrific. Hey, Tom?

23:54.903 --> 23:56.871
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna go back to sleep now.

23:57.039 --> 23:58.165
Oh, okay. Sure.

23:58.907 --> 24:00.534
Love you.

24:00.976 --> 24:03.035
Good night. Call me tomorrow.

24:13.121 --> 24:14.782
This stuff's all old.

24:14.957 --> 24:16.925
Yeah. That's the point.

24:17.292 --> 24:18.350
Let's go to Fendi.

24:18.527 --> 24:19.926
- Fendi? No. No, no.
- Yes.

24:20.095 --> 24:22.359
- We're here. Let's just stay here.
- Yes.

24:22.531 --> 24:24.021
I'm not into old stuff.

24:24.199 --> 24:26.030
Why are you talking
like a six year old?

24:26.201 --> 24:27.429
I'm not.

24:29.538 --> 24:32.996
This line is too long.
Can't we just go somewhere else?

24:33.175 --> 24:35.302
No. This is the best bakery
in the world.

24:35.477 --> 24:37.536
That's why it's worth waiting in line.

24:37.713 --> 24:40.375
Come on, we'll play a game.
Wanna play a game?

24:40.549 --> 24:42.312
- Yeah, we can play a game.
- Okay, good.

24:43.352 --> 24:45.718
- Tell me what to order.
- Why?

24:45.887 --> 24:48.447
You'll see. It'll be fun.
Make a suggestion.

24:49.992 --> 24:52.085
- A cookie.
- No, no, you have to be specific...

24:52.261 --> 24:54.229
...like what type of cookie.

24:55.998 --> 24:58.330
A really big cookie.

25:06.875 --> 25:09.105
Tom, your phone's ringing.

25:13.382 --> 25:14.872
Hello?

25:15.417 --> 25:16.884
Hello?

25:17.286 --> 25:18.913
Nope.

25:20.022 --> 25:22.786
- What's wrong?
- Missed an important call.

25:22.958 --> 25:25.586
That's because
you're an important person.

25:26.128 --> 25:29.894
No. Oh, wait.
Hey, come to mama.

25:30.065 --> 25:32.761
We will have two fried dumplings...

25:32.934 --> 25:36.529
...two of the wontons,
and six of the fried porky thingies.

25:36.705 --> 25:38.468
Yeah, but that's fried.

25:38.640 --> 25:39.902
- Come on.
- It's not healthy.

25:40.075 --> 25:42.873
Have some of the fried.
It won't hurt you.

25:44.479 --> 25:46.003
Thank you.

25:46.381 --> 25:48.679
Move, please.

25:49.017 --> 25:51.315
Oh, gosh.

25:51.687 --> 25:53.587
This is unbelievable.

25:53.755 --> 25:55.689
- Hello?
- Hey. Hello?

25:55.857 --> 25:57.119
<i>Hello?</i>

25:57.292 --> 25:59.351
- Hannah?
- <i>Hello?</i>

25:59.528 --> 26:02.725
- Hey.
- Tom? Tom, is that you?

26:03.231 --> 26:05.426
- <i>Tom?</i>
- Hello?

26:05.600 --> 26:06.624
Hello?

26:06.802 --> 26:09.327
<i>You're cutting out.</i>
<i>I can't hear anything you've said.</i>

26:09.504 --> 26:14.134
I'm stuck in a thunderstorm.
I'm surrounded with a herd of cows.

26:14.309 --> 26:18.245
- I'll call when I get to the hotel. Tom?
- <i>Hannah, I can't hear you.</i>

26:31.693 --> 26:33.251
Hello?

26:34.930 --> 26:37.262
Hello? Hello?

26:37.666 --> 26:39.293
Hello?

26:48.343 --> 26:50.436
Oh, I hate Scotland.

27:15.971 --> 27:17.905
We're having a hard time.

27:18.073 --> 27:19.472
We're having a hard time.

27:19.641 --> 27:21.939
Oh, yeah? Want a hand?

27:22.110 --> 27:24.101
- Give us a little...
- We'd love it.

27:24.279 --> 27:26.873
- I think you'd better sit down, sir.
- I might fall in.

27:27.048 --> 27:28.811
- Sit down there, sir.
- Sit, sit, sit.

27:28.984 --> 27:30.508
Here we go.

27:31.153 --> 27:32.814
- Don't come in.
- Hang on.

27:32.988 --> 27:34.819
Thank you, thank you.

27:34.990 --> 27:37.220
- Have a good afternoon.
- Have a wonderful day.

27:51.339 --> 27:53.500
- Give it up, baby.
- What do you got, Gar?

27:53.675 --> 27:55.506
- Come on, scrub.
- What you got?

27:55.677 --> 27:57.474
Let's go. What do you got, Gar?

27:57.646 --> 27:59.739
What do you got, Gar?
What do you got?

28:00.182 --> 28:01.513
Come on, Tom. Tom, Tom.

28:01.683 --> 28:02.843
Easy.

28:03.018 --> 28:06.044
Tom, foul. That's a foul, Tom.
What's the matter with you today?

28:06.221 --> 28:09.418
I don't know. I think
I might have feelings for Hannah.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.160
Oh, come on, come on.
Let's just play.

28:15.564 --> 28:19.295
It's just without her,
something's off.

28:19.468 --> 28:21.732
It's got me thinking
that there's more to life...

28:21.903 --> 28:23.632
...than just sleeping around.

28:25.707 --> 28:28.107
- I don't understand.
- I'm not following.

28:28.276 --> 28:31.575
Come on, let's just play.
Come on. I'll take it out.

28:31.746 --> 28:33.941
I know exactly what you mean, Tom.

28:34.115 --> 28:35.776
Thanks. Here you go.

28:36.685 --> 28:38.778
I'm gonna tell Hannah.
When she gets home...

28:38.954 --> 28:40.012
...l'm gonna tell her.

28:40.188 --> 28:42.986
- Nothing about marriage, just together.
- That's romantic.

28:46.061 --> 28:49.553
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

28:49.731 --> 28:53.189
<i>Hey, Tom, I'm back.</i>
<i>God, I cannot wait to see you.</i>

28:53.368 --> 28:56.735
<i>I don't care what you're doing tonight,</i>
<i>cancel it. We're going to dinner.</i>

28:56.905 --> 28:59.999
<i>Meet me at that new place next</i>
<i>to the small Greek place we hated...</i>

29:00.175 --> 29:03.440
<i>... that used to be the Thai-fusion place</i>
<i>we loved. Meet me there, 8:00.</i>

29:03.612 --> 29:06.080
<i>I have so much to tell you.</i>

29:21.863 --> 29:23.296
All right.

29:27.636 --> 29:28.864
Okay.

29:31.273 --> 29:32.865
Have a good night.

30:20.922 --> 30:22.412
Tom. You okay?

30:22.591 --> 30:26.118
- I'm all right. Are you all right?
- I think I broke a rib.

30:26.294 --> 30:28.854
- Sorry about your flowers.
- His rib. I'm fine. I'm fine.

30:29.030 --> 30:30.520
- Are you okay?
- I'm so sorry.

30:30.699 --> 30:33.099
- I'm sorry, sir. Here are your flowers.
- Oh, but...

30:33.268 --> 30:35.168
- You had flowers?
- They're not my flowers.

30:35.337 --> 30:37.862
- Your flowers. Those are yours.
- I didn't have flowers.

30:38.039 --> 30:40.599
- It's good to see you. It's great.
- I missed you.

30:40.775 --> 30:43.608
- There's someone I want you to meet.
- Oh, good.

30:44.346 --> 30:48.043
It started pouring and suddenly
it was just me in a field of cows.

30:48.216 --> 30:51.617
Of course, we're in Europe. There are
no signs and it's getting dark.

30:51.786 --> 30:54.414
I think she thought she was
in some bad werewolf movie.

30:54.589 --> 30:56.580
"Stay off the moors, lassie."

30:58.526 --> 31:01.427
So anyway,
all of a sudden out of nowhere...

31:01.596 --> 31:03.530
...Colin comes riding up
on horseback...

31:03.698 --> 31:07.134
Can you believe it? A horse.
- and asks me if I need any help.

31:07.302 --> 31:09.634
You were a lady in distress.
What was I gonna do?

31:09.804 --> 31:11.863
It was right out of a Brontë novel.

31:13.375 --> 31:16.572
So anyway, he shows me
to this charming little inn...

31:16.745 --> 31:20.181
...where he proceeds to buy me
the most awful dinner I've ever had.

31:20.348 --> 31:23.840
Right. Okay. Aye. It was pretty bad,
even by Scottish standards.

31:24.853 --> 31:27.378
We spent the next month
traveling around the country...

31:27.555 --> 31:31.889
...getting to know each other,
visiting museums. It was...

31:32.060 --> 31:34.358
- It was perfect.
- It was perfect.

31:39.567 --> 31:41.660
When it was time
for Hannah to leave, I just...

31:43.138 --> 31:45.834
I don't know, I just...
I couldn't let her go.

31:46.241 --> 31:49.836
- So I got down on one knee...
- And he proposed, and I accepted.

31:50.011 --> 31:52.138
Wow, that's just... It's huge, it's...

31:52.313 --> 31:54.042
The wedding's coming
together quickly.

31:54.215 --> 31:55.239
It sounds like it.

31:55.417 --> 31:57.715
We're gonna get married
at Colin's parents' home.

31:57.886 --> 32:00.047
It's gonna be small.
We can't expect people...

32:00.221 --> 32:02.712
...to make the trip overseas
in just a fortnight.

32:03.391 --> 32:04.483
- A fortnight.
- Right.

32:04.659 --> 32:06.524
- That's two weeks.
- It's crazy, isn't it?

32:06.695 --> 32:08.822
- Have you ever been to Scotland?
- I haven't.

32:08.997 --> 32:11.465
You should see the church
where we're exchanging vows.

32:11.633 --> 32:14.124
Same church that Colin's parents
were married in.

32:14.302 --> 32:16.167
It's across the loch
from our distillery.

32:16.337 --> 32:17.827
- Distillery?
- Colin's family...

32:18.006 --> 32:21.032
...owns the largest
whiskey distillery in Scotland.

32:21.209 --> 32:22.574
Tom, look.

32:22.744 --> 32:26.407
If you were getting married
I'd expect to be your best man.

32:26.581 --> 32:31.075
Tom, will you be my maid of honor?

32:34.122 --> 32:35.350
Your maid of honor?

32:38.393 --> 32:40.554
Oh, I'm so sorry.

32:42.697 --> 32:45.257
- Forgive me, l...
- What is it with you, man?

32:45.633 --> 32:48.397
What are you...?
Excuse me. Excuse me.

32:48.570 --> 32:49.764
Did you see that?

32:52.140 --> 32:54.131
Maid of honor.

32:54.309 --> 32:56.641
That's funny stuff. But you're a guy.

32:56.811 --> 32:58.745
- Go ahead, just get it out.
- Oh, my...

32:58.913 --> 33:02.007
So, what did you say?
Did you say yes?

33:02.183 --> 33:04.879
I didn't know what to say.
I told her I'd think about it.

33:05.053 --> 33:07.954
Think about whether that dress
gonna make your ass look big.

33:08.123 --> 33:10.614
- Give me a break. Come on.
- All right, let me think.

33:10.792 --> 33:11.850
She into this guy?

33:12.026 --> 33:15.427
You should have seen her. Staring
at him moony, like he shits unicorns.

33:15.597 --> 33:17.690
That's not good.
You're gonna have to do this.

33:17.866 --> 33:20.596
You're gonna have to be
the maid of honor. I'm serious.

33:20.769 --> 33:24.000
Think about it. This would give you
an excuse to be around Hannah.

33:24.172 --> 33:28.108
Helping her out,
being the man behind the curtain.

33:28.276 --> 33:29.607
You'd be her confidant.

33:30.111 --> 33:33.547
Then you could use that time to point
out to Hannah that this is crazy...

33:33.715 --> 33:35.774
...and that she doesn't
even know this guy.

33:35.950 --> 33:38.817
- I'm not gonna do that. No way. No.
- What? Look.

33:38.987 --> 33:42.013
I don't know
what your other options are.

33:42.357 --> 33:45.258
You got a better chance
of stopping this wedding from inside...

33:45.426 --> 33:47.121
...than from another continent.

33:47.295 --> 33:51.026
And they say that you can shorten this
and wear it again if you like.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.992
Come on, if you're serious
and you really want Hannah back...

33:55.170 --> 33:58.333
...from this guy, you're gonna
have to do whatever it takes.

33:58.973 --> 34:00.338
Whatever.

34:11.886 --> 34:14.878
- Your dress is beautiful.
- Thank you.

34:15.056 --> 34:18.116
I am so happy you're gonna do this.

34:18.426 --> 34:21.827
Pleasure. For this wedding,
I am willing to do whatever it takes.

34:22.096 --> 34:23.529
- I'm so excited.
- Yeah, me too.

34:23.697 --> 34:25.824
So let me tell you who
the bridesmaids are.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.900
- All right. Stephanie.
- I like Stephanie.

34:28.069 --> 34:29.127
- She loves you.
- Good.

34:29.304 --> 34:31.329
- My friend Hilary.
- I don't know Hilary.

34:31.505 --> 34:33.371
- She's the best.
- Okay.

34:34.141 --> 34:35.699
- And Melissa.
- Oh, no.

34:35.877 --> 34:37.902
- I had to. She's my cousin.
- She hates me.

34:38.079 --> 34:40.570
- Well, you broke her heart.
- She broke my nose.

34:40.748 --> 34:43.012
- That was an accident.
- She hit me with her fist.

34:43.184 --> 34:47.416
I was honest with her. I said, "Look,
nothing serious," and she agreed.

34:47.621 --> 34:49.647
Sometimes our hearts
don't match our mouths.

34:49.824 --> 34:51.485
That's good. Put that in the vows.

34:51.659 --> 34:54.127
She's wanted to be my maid of honor
since we were 5...

34:54.295 --> 34:56.159
...so now
she's really gonna hate you.

34:56.331 --> 34:57.423
There they are now.

34:57.599 --> 35:00.762
Okay, well, as your maid of honor,
I promise to keep the peace.

35:13.915 --> 35:16.247
- Oh, hi.
- There she is.

35:17.085 --> 35:19.178
- Hello, good to see you.
- Oh, the bride-to-be.

35:19.354 --> 35:20.378
- I'm Tom.
- I'm Hilary.

35:20.555 --> 35:22.682
Very nice to meet you.

35:23.224 --> 35:26.284
Stephanie, how are you doing?
It's so good to see you too.

35:26.461 --> 35:27.485
Are you kidding me?

35:27.662 --> 35:30.426
Look at you, Melissa.
How have you been?

35:33.801 --> 35:35.564
- That went great.
- This isn't awkward.

35:35.737 --> 35:39.002
It's gonna be fine, it's gonna be fine.
Don't worry. I'm gonna be fine.

35:45.947 --> 35:48.074
So, Tom, have you met Colin yet?

35:48.249 --> 35:50.809
- Yes.
- Isn't he dreamy?

35:51.686 --> 35:53.677
Absolutely.

35:53.855 --> 35:56.050
Could someone please
pass me the Splenda?

35:57.325 --> 36:00.886
Could someone who's not
a misogynist pass the Splenda?

36:03.932 --> 36:05.763
- Hello?
- Thank you, Stephanie.

36:06.601 --> 36:07.795
It's Colin, you guys.

36:10.138 --> 36:12.732
Hi, babe. One sec.

36:12.907 --> 36:14.306
Hi.

36:14.475 --> 36:16.306
They're so cute.

36:18.713 --> 36:21.375
We have nine days before we leave.
We have to act quickly.

36:21.549 --> 36:23.278
Exactly. I've been
a MOH six times...

36:23.451 --> 36:25.385
...so I'll organize everything
to be done.

36:25.553 --> 36:28.317
Even though
I'm not officially the MOH here.

36:28.489 --> 36:30.855
- What is a MOH?
- M-O-H.

36:31.025 --> 36:33.926
- Oh, maid of honor. That's you.
- Oh, that's clever. Yeah.

36:34.095 --> 36:36.359
No, it's going great.

36:36.531 --> 36:38.658
Very smoothly.

36:38.833 --> 36:41.165
So we've got the bridal shower,
the bachelorette...

36:41.336 --> 36:42.860
...dress fittings, the kilt...

36:43.037 --> 36:45.699
- I'll do the kilts.
- Oh, good.

36:45.873 --> 36:48.307
Shopping for Hannah's trousseau.
That's gonna be fun.

36:48.476 --> 36:50.740
Trousseau? What is a trousseau?

36:50.912 --> 36:53.813
It's lingerie. For her wedding night.

36:53.982 --> 36:57.110
How do you expect to be a good MOH
if you don't even know that?

36:57.285 --> 36:59.685
- She's talking to me.
- No, I didn't.

36:59.854 --> 37:03.085
- You just did.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Tom.

37:03.257 --> 37:04.884
Did I break a rule?

37:05.059 --> 37:07.550
Oh, how about we focus
on the wedding part?

37:07.729 --> 37:10.323
- Good idea. Let's do that.
- Okay, I need dress sizes.

37:10.498 --> 37:12.056
- I'm a four.
- Hey.

37:12.233 --> 37:13.894
Eight.

37:14.135 --> 37:15.500
I'm sorry.

37:17.538 --> 37:19.472
You know, Hilary...

37:19.640 --> 37:23.838
...do you think that maybe you'd just
be more comfortable in, like, a 12?

37:24.012 --> 37:27.573
No, it'll be fine.
I'm doing the Dr. Riverbed fast.

37:27.749 --> 37:29.649
- Oh, yeah.
- What is that?

37:30.418 --> 37:32.147
Water, peach resin, apple pectin...

37:32.320 --> 37:34.982
...shark extract
and Lawry's seasoning salt.

37:35.156 --> 37:36.418
What about food?

37:36.591 --> 37:39.754
Look, I am going to look amazing
in that dress...

37:39.927 --> 37:44.364
...I am going to meet a Scottish man
and I'm gonna be happy.

37:44.532 --> 37:46.830
- Write down an 8.
- Got it.

37:47.001 --> 37:49.196
What's your dress size,
maid of honor?

37:49.370 --> 37:51.668
I don't know.
What's your jock size, Melissa?

37:51.839 --> 37:53.864
Okay, guys. That's enough.
It's enough.

37:54.242 --> 37:57.336
Sorry. But will you guys
look at Hannah, please?

37:57.512 --> 37:59.002
Okay, she's happy, finally.

37:59.180 --> 38:02.206
So could you please,
for Hannah, let's all just get along...

38:02.383 --> 38:05.944
...hook a smile on our faces
and pretend like everything is perfect.

38:06.721 --> 38:08.689
Okay, fine. Okay.

38:09.524 --> 38:11.719
- Oh, my God. That's great.
- What did he say?

38:11.893 --> 38:14.657
- How's he doing?
- Oh, he's so sweet.

38:15.363 --> 38:17.297
Isn't that great.

38:17.799 --> 38:19.027
How's it going?

38:19.200 --> 38:20.758
- Great.
- Good. Really good.

38:20.935 --> 38:22.960
Fantastic. Fantastic.

38:23.137 --> 38:25.435
- I mean, it is pretty much done.
- Perfect. Really?

38:26.274 --> 38:28.105
- Tom?
- Yes.

38:28.276 --> 38:30.176
- Here.
- What is this?

38:30.344 --> 38:32.005
She does
bridal-shower entertainment.

38:32.180 --> 38:34.978
I hired her for Stephanie's sister's
shower. Hannah loved it.

38:35.149 --> 38:37.583
- She reads tarot cards.
- That's great. Thank you.

38:37.752 --> 38:40.118
I'm not doing it for you,
I'm doing it for Hannah.

38:40.288 --> 38:43.314
Okay. Thank you. For Hannah.

38:43.491 --> 38:44.583
It should've been me.

38:44.759 --> 38:46.989
- I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye, Tom.
- Goodbye.

38:47.161 --> 38:49.254
- Bye, Hilary.
- See you. Nice meeting you.

38:49.430 --> 38:52.126
I just had a very nice
bonding moment with Melissa.

38:52.300 --> 38:53.767
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Sure.

38:53.935 --> 38:56.802
My mother and grandmother
are coming into town tomorrow...

38:56.971 --> 38:58.370
...and I have so much to plan.

38:58.539 --> 39:01.804
I was wondering if you and your boys
could entertain Colin for the day.

39:01.976 --> 39:04.035
- Entertain him?
- Get to know him and stuff.

39:04.212 --> 39:05.770
- Sure. Yeah.
- Cool.

39:06.848 --> 39:10.807
So are you more proud of Scotch tape
or McDonald's?

39:11.385 --> 39:13.216
I think they're both American.

39:13.387 --> 39:15.355
You invited this guy
to play ball with us?

39:15.523 --> 39:16.547
He's the competition.

39:16.724 --> 39:19.056
I need to get to know
his strengths and weaknesses.

39:19.227 --> 39:22.526
I like his green shirt.
Is that like a poly blend kind of thing?

39:22.697 --> 39:24.358
- It's my shirt.
- It's your shirt?

39:24.532 --> 39:26.500
- Yeah. Looks good on him.
- Looks real good.

39:26.667 --> 39:28.464
Why don't you play with him?

39:28.903 --> 39:30.200
Thanks.

39:30.371 --> 39:32.134
Colin,
you ever play basketball before?

39:32.306 --> 39:34.297
We would call this netball.

39:34.475 --> 39:36.306
In Scotland it's more
of a woman's game.

39:36.477 --> 39:38.445
So no,
I don't have much experience.

39:38.613 --> 39:41.548
- I do. You need one more?
- We're good.

39:42.483 --> 39:43.814
All right.

39:44.452 --> 39:46.977
- All right, girls. You ready?
- Yeah. I am.

39:47.388 --> 39:49.788
- Gotta use your hands there.
- You all right there?

39:51.859 --> 39:53.690
- I'm open, I'm open.
- There we go.

39:53.861 --> 39:57.729
You gotta hold on to the ball, man.
You hold on to the ball.

39:58.099 --> 39:59.464
Almost.

40:01.169 --> 40:03.160
You should get some Scottish girls
out here.

40:03.337 --> 40:06.067
No, you want to start again
because you didn't get that.

40:07.141 --> 40:09.268
There you go. That was good.
Here you go.

40:09.443 --> 40:11.877
What do you got? Shoot that. Nice.

40:14.015 --> 40:16.040
- I like it like that.
- Sorry, guys.

40:16.217 --> 40:17.946
Get on him.

40:18.586 --> 40:22.579
Lay-up.
Get in there, ball. You okay?

40:23.357 --> 40:25.450
Okay, back to you.
Put it in the basket.

40:25.626 --> 40:27.059
Put it in the basket.

40:27.762 --> 40:30.492
You know what I'm loving?
The guy's a chump.

40:31.999 --> 40:33.899
- There it is.
- Arms up, baby. That's good.

40:34.068 --> 40:35.831
That's it, that's it.
We got it now.

40:36.003 --> 40:37.197
Hey, I look good, don't I?

40:37.838 --> 40:39.965
Here we go. Here we go now.

40:40.141 --> 40:41.165
Yo!

40:41.342 --> 40:42.741
Just put it in the basket.

40:43.578 --> 40:45.045
- Go ahead.
- Put it in the basket.

40:45.213 --> 40:47.044
Hey, take a shot.

40:51.519 --> 40:53.282
- Sorry, guys, huh?
- Did you see that?

40:53.454 --> 40:55.513
Probably not allowed
to stuff it in the net.

40:55.690 --> 40:57.214
- He dunks the ball.
- Sorry, sorry.

40:57.391 --> 40:59.484
He dunks the ball.

40:59.660 --> 41:01.457
That was awesome. You can dunk.

41:01.629 --> 41:03.563
He can dunk. That is awesome.

41:03.731 --> 41:06.199
Wait, if that's allowed,
why don't you guys all do it?

41:06.367 --> 41:08.927
Yeah, if we could, we would. Right?

41:09.103 --> 41:10.730
Nice!

41:32.126 --> 41:33.150
Yes!

41:33.327 --> 41:36.455
- Good game, yeah. Good game.
- My brother.

41:36.631 --> 41:38.826
He's gonna be
more competition than you thought.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.729
- I know, I know.
- I love this guy.

41:56.651 --> 41:58.209
Shit.

41:59.287 --> 42:00.413
- You all right?
- Yeah.

42:00.588 --> 42:02.146
Hey.

42:02.323 --> 42:06.225
- Holy...
- That boy's got mad-cow disease.

42:08.062 --> 42:09.529
We gotta get dirt on this guy.

42:09.697 --> 42:12.393
I got a guy I use when
a spouse suspects infidelity.

42:12.566 --> 42:14.466
Everybody's got skeletons
in their closet.

42:14.635 --> 42:16.933
Nobody's squeaky clean
and my guy is the best.

42:17.104 --> 42:18.162
It just seems so cheap.

42:18.339 --> 42:20.739
It won't be.
I'll charge double because you're rich.

42:20.908 --> 42:22.876
- It's a cheap thing to do.
- He plays cheap.

42:23.044 --> 42:25.308
- You gotta match that.
- How does Colin play cheap?

42:25.479 --> 42:27.379
That thing with Hannah,
being Scottish...

42:27.548 --> 42:29.379
...making her fall in love
in Scotland.

42:29.550 --> 42:32.417
That monster thing of his.

42:33.154 --> 42:35.622
Fine. Get the dirt.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.184
That's cool.

42:42.730 --> 42:44.721
<i>The white zone</i>
<i>is for immediate loading...</i>

42:44.899 --> 42:47.424
<i>... and unloading of passengers only.</i>

42:47.601 --> 42:49.694
<i>No parking.</i>

42:53.641 --> 42:55.700
What's he gonna do, eat her?

42:56.777 --> 42:58.210
Come on, come on, come on.

42:58.379 --> 43:01.007
Okay, take a breath,
take a breath, take a...

43:06.087 --> 43:07.714
Thanks, Tom.

43:08.155 --> 43:10.055
Yeah, have a great flight.

43:10.224 --> 43:12.089
Bye. Thanks, mate.

43:13.594 --> 43:14.822
Come on.

43:19.633 --> 43:21.328
- I love you, Colin.
- Bye.

43:21.502 --> 43:23.163
Bye.

43:26.874 --> 43:28.535
Yeah.

43:29.143 --> 43:30.906
Oh, God.

43:31.612 --> 43:33.842
- Need some ChapStick?
- Yeah.

43:34.014 --> 43:36.312
So, what church are we going to?

43:36.484 --> 43:37.746
Grace Church.

43:47.328 --> 43:49.694
Thank you for coming with me
to meet the reverend.

43:49.864 --> 43:52.162
- Oh, it's no problem.
- He is the sweetest man.

43:52.333 --> 43:53.357
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:53.534 --> 43:56.992
He married my parents and insisted on
coming to Scotland to do my wedding.

43:57.171 --> 43:59.139
Why didn't Colin
stay and do this with you?

43:59.306 --> 44:01.831
It was more important for him
to go back to Scotland...

44:02.009 --> 44:05.069
...to petition the Grand Council
so Colin and I could get married.

44:05.246 --> 44:06.838
What's a Gran... What's that mean?

44:07.014 --> 44:10.006
I'm not Scottish, and his family
is kind of like, you know.

44:10.184 --> 44:12.948
- What?
- Royalty.

44:13.120 --> 44:14.712
Royalty?

44:14.889 --> 44:19.223
- Royalty? What is he, like a king?
- No, no. He's a duke.

44:22.029 --> 44:23.963
A duke?

44:29.437 --> 44:32.201
- Hannah, darling.
- Reverend Foote.

44:33.340 --> 44:36.969
And this must be the lucky young man
who's marrying our beautiful Hannah.

44:37.144 --> 44:39.442
- Oh, no. I'm not marrying him.
- No.

44:39.613 --> 44:42.776
This is Tom, my maid of honor.

44:43.350 --> 44:45.341
- Maid of honor?
- Yes.

44:45.519 --> 44:47.043
Well, how about that?

44:47.221 --> 44:51.055
We have many gay and lesbian
members of the congregation.

44:51.559 --> 44:53.117
Welcome.

45:02.269 --> 45:04.897
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Reverend.

45:10.010 --> 45:13.070
- So let's talk about the wedding.
- Okay.

45:13.247 --> 45:16.045
I need to get some details
about you and...

45:16.217 --> 45:18.310
- Colin.
- Colin. Colin, yes.

45:18.486 --> 45:21.216
- I want to work it into the ceremony.
- Okay.

45:21.388 --> 45:24.721
- Well, it was such a whirlwind, really.
- Yes, well, enlighten me.

45:24.892 --> 45:26.553
Tell me about it.

45:28.662 --> 45:30.254
Hannah, darling.

45:30.998 --> 45:33.899
Hannah, I think it's important
to dig deep here for the vows...

45:34.068 --> 45:36.696
...and tell Reverend Foote
all that you know about Colin.

45:36.871 --> 45:39.533
All that you love about him.
Not just the obvious stuff...

45:39.707 --> 45:42.403
...but those unique characteristics
that are Colin.

45:42.576 --> 45:45.374
Those things
that make you laugh and say:

45:47.214 --> 45:49.114
"That's so Colin."

45:51.285 --> 45:52.377
Right.

45:52.553 --> 45:56.045
And then, you know, maybe you could
get some information from Colin...

45:56.223 --> 46:00.387
...and emphasize their unique bond.
Their shared history.

46:00.561 --> 46:02.028
Of course.

46:03.163 --> 46:05.097
We could talk about
love at first sight.

46:05.266 --> 46:08.463
Well, that's always a crowd pleaser,
but...

46:08.636 --> 46:11.366
Hannah, elaborate.
Tell me more about him.

46:11.539 --> 46:13.530
How you feel about him.

46:20.180 --> 46:22.045
- Where did you meet?
- In Scotland.

46:22.216 --> 46:24.013
Modigliani.

46:24.552 --> 46:26.019
Your first summer in New York...

46:26.186 --> 46:28.950
...you were dating a guy
and he asked you to move in.

46:29.123 --> 46:32.422
You weren't sure. That was around
the time you discovered Modigliani...

46:32.593 --> 46:34.561
...and became obsessed
with his painting...

46:34.728 --> 46:37.720
...of this woman who had
a blue scarf on, holding a baby.

46:37.898 --> 46:40.890
Hannah said, "That painting captured
the essence of that woman...

46:41.068 --> 46:44.333
...better than any photograph."
- I can't believe you remember that.

46:44.505 --> 46:48.100
I remember she freaked. She felt
more passionate about that painting...

46:48.275 --> 46:50.334
...than about Mr. Wall Street.

46:50.511 --> 46:52.411
She wondered if she could
meet somebody...

46:52.580 --> 46:55.811
...that could make her feel
as passionate as that work of art.

46:55.983 --> 46:59.384
That's good. That's good.

46:59.553 --> 47:01.248
Modigliani.

47:01.422 --> 47:04.653
Now I know why you picked him
to be maid of honor. Yes.

47:04.825 --> 47:06.292
Well...

47:08.495 --> 47:11.760
Come on. Who's ready to lose some
money tonight? I'm feeling lucky.

47:11.932 --> 47:13.456
You guys are late. How you doing?

47:13.634 --> 47:16.398
- How you holding up, champ?
- I'm stressed.

47:16.570 --> 47:19.130
- Hannah's shower's in the morning.
- Where we gonna play?

47:19.306 --> 47:22.537
We're not gonna play till these baskets
and everything else gets done.

47:22.710 --> 47:25.372
- What about this party mix?
- That's potpourri.

47:25.546 --> 47:28.106
Oh, this is perfect.
Come on, Felix, take it off.

47:28.282 --> 47:30.842
Deb has one of these.
It's funny, you can't see a thing.

47:31.018 --> 47:33.953
- She'd have to, to sleep with you.
- You could be, like, blinded.

47:34.121 --> 47:36.783
No, I'm not playing with baskets.
It's poker night.

47:40.394 --> 47:42.794
- You put bayberry with serenity.
- You no like?

47:42.963 --> 47:46.091
No, I thought it was obvious that
bayberry worked best with harmony.

47:46.266 --> 47:50.464
Really? I've been putting bayberry
with Tahitian Sunrise.

47:50.971 --> 47:53.496
- That, I like. That's Zen.
- Yeah. You know what I like?

47:53.674 --> 47:55.972
I like how you put the bath ball
in the center.

47:56.143 --> 47:59.635
I like that so much, I'm gonna see
your ball and raise you another ball.

47:59.813 --> 48:01.610
Good idea.
You should have two balls.

48:01.782 --> 48:03.511
- Get you another ball.
- Hey, Dennis...

48:03.684 --> 48:05.413
...come and curl some ribbon.

48:05.586 --> 48:08.851
I can feel my sperm dying inside of me
one at a time.

48:09.023 --> 48:11.082
Shut up and grab a basket.
Come on, it's fun.

48:11.258 --> 48:13.226
I'm going to a strip club
to eat some meat.

48:13.394 --> 48:15.225
Then I'm gonna get into a fight.

48:15.663 --> 48:17.460
Call me when you find your balls,
Tom.

48:17.631 --> 48:18.723
All right, tough guy.

48:18.899 --> 48:22.460
Or maybe they're in the basket
next to the Tahitian Sunrise.

48:23.337 --> 48:25.396
Someone's afraid
of his feminine side.

48:25.939 --> 48:28.931
Look at that... Oh, nice job
with the fluffing. Look at that, huh?

48:29.109 --> 48:31.236
You tjuzsed it,
and it's been tjuzsed, and...

48:31.412 --> 48:32.470
- Look at us.
- Come on.

48:32.646 --> 48:34.170
- Nice work, huh?
- You can't lose.

48:36.817 --> 48:40.446
Oh, shit.
Hello, ladies. You look lovely today.

48:41.288 --> 48:42.778
- Tom.
- Hilary, how are you?

48:42.956 --> 48:46.858
Good. Everything looks wonderful.
This is the best shower I've been to.

48:47.027 --> 48:49.086
Really, you think so?
You know what, Hilary?

48:49.263 --> 48:53.529
- You should really eat something.
- No. Tom, I'm fine.

48:56.870 --> 48:58.770
I'm fine. I'm okay.

48:58.939 --> 49:01.533
What you ladies go through
to fit into a dress.

49:01.709 --> 49:05.440
This blows your rule out of the water
about no women allowed at your place.

49:05.612 --> 49:07.477
What good's a rule
if you don't break it?

49:07.648 --> 49:10.208
I'm very, very impressed.
Thank you...

49:10.384 --> 49:13.842
Listen to that.
Gay Gordons party remix, just for you.

49:17.224 --> 49:19.124
Hear the horn? Hear the horn?

49:19.293 --> 49:22.353
It's good, isn't it? Wait, let me
turn it up for you. There it is.

49:22.529 --> 49:23.928
- It's a little loud.
- What?

49:24.098 --> 49:26.965
- It's a little loud!
- Okay. I'll turn it down. There you go.

49:27.134 --> 49:28.829
Look at this. Try this.
Haggis Pink.

49:29.002 --> 49:34.998
It's pepper, cheese, chopped up baby
lamb lung, and cow pituitary gland.

49:35.375 --> 49:38.139
It's a Scottish delicacy.
Colin recommended it.

49:40.981 --> 49:44.439
Ladies. Ladies.
Look what just came for Hannah.

49:46.754 --> 49:48.381
It's from Colin, everyone.

49:50.524 --> 49:52.958
Wait, there's a card.
There's a card. There's a card.

49:53.127 --> 49:54.890
It says "Hannah."

49:55.496 --> 49:57.964
"Hannah, my love,
this is the extremely rare...

49:58.132 --> 50:00.123
...Scottish, floral, bud thistle."

50:00.300 --> 50:01.324
Thistle?

50:01.502 --> 50:04.403
"They only bloom for four hours
before they die."

50:04.571 --> 50:07.631
He must have timed this out
perfectly.

50:07.808 --> 50:09.901
Oh, my gosh. When we first met,
Colin joked...

50:10.077 --> 50:13.604
...that he would roam the countryside
to find me one, and he did.

50:14.414 --> 50:18.077
Sweetheart, that's the most
romantic thing I've ever heard.

50:18.252 --> 50:19.514
Thanks, Mom.

50:19.686 --> 50:21.586
Joan, good to see you.
It's been too long.

50:21.755 --> 50:23.518
I think, Easter, wasn't it?

50:23.690 --> 50:26.158
Yes. You slept with our maid.

50:26.760 --> 50:28.887
She told you?
I didn't know she spoke English.

50:29.062 --> 50:30.086
Yes, hi.

50:30.264 --> 50:32.095
This is Grandma Pearl.
You remember Tom.

50:32.266 --> 50:35.861
- How are you?
- Oh, yes. The fornicator.

50:37.337 --> 50:38.998
That's right.

50:39.306 --> 50:41.968
- Okay.
- Tom, this is awesome.

50:42.142 --> 50:43.939
- It's great.
- Good, thank you.

50:44.111 --> 50:46.170
This is even better
than my sister's shower.

50:46.346 --> 50:48.314
Really?
It appears to be going well. Yes?

50:48.482 --> 50:50.918
- Sharon would like to set up.
- Who?

50:51.451 --> 50:53.510
- The entertainment.
- Yes.

50:53.687 --> 50:56.884
Thank God... I mean, good.
She should set up over there.

50:57.057 --> 51:01.187
Hello, everybody. Hi, I'm Sharon.
Good to see you all.

51:01.361 --> 51:03.454
Yeah, come on, right down front.

51:03.730 --> 51:05.527
This was my idea, you know.

51:05.699 --> 51:08.224
I know you loved her
from Stephanie's sister's shower...

51:08.402 --> 51:10.734
I'd like for us all
to take in a deep breath.

51:10.904 --> 51:12.804
She wasn't at the shower.

51:13.140 --> 51:14.266
- She wasn't?
- No.

51:14.441 --> 51:16.170
- And now exhale slowly.
- Really?

51:16.343 --> 51:18.038
Good job. Good job.

51:18.212 --> 51:20.510
It's very important to reset
our third eye...

51:20.681 --> 51:24.117
...and connect to the primal... inside
of ourselves...

51:24.651 --> 51:26.414
...before I present the pleasure aids.

51:27.221 --> 51:29.587
- Pleasure aids?
- Now...

51:29.756 --> 51:34.819
...these pleasure aids are best used
when in a tantric, meditative state.

51:34.995 --> 51:37.020
And today,
I'm going to show you ladies...

51:37.197 --> 51:40.257
...how to reach your optimal,
sacral chakra.

51:40.434 --> 51:43.028
All of these aids are for sale, ladies.

51:43.203 --> 51:47.264
And... Oh, look what we have here.
We have edible panties.

51:47.441 --> 51:51.241
You look hungry. Here,
snack on these. There you go.

51:51.411 --> 51:55.313
Now, ladies, what pleasure party
would be complete without...

51:55.482 --> 51:57.507
...glow-in-the-dark thunder beads.

51:57.818 --> 52:01.254
These are terrific.
And for you ladies today, two for one.

52:01.421 --> 52:03.446
Okay? There you go.

52:03.624 --> 52:05.683
Do you wanna try those out,
princess?

52:06.093 --> 52:08.254
Where do these go?

52:10.864 --> 52:14.630
From casual right into evening wear.
Gorgeous.

52:14.801 --> 52:17.292
You know what,
why don't you keep those.

52:17.671 --> 52:19.935
Oh, and they match your earrings.

52:31.018 --> 52:32.713
Hannah, you okay?

52:34.888 --> 52:36.856
You know I dreamt
of my wedding shower...

52:37.024 --> 52:39.424
...ever since I was 10 years old?
- No.

52:39.593 --> 52:41.857
Strangely enough,
the image of my Grandma Pearl...

52:42.029 --> 52:45.965
...draped in glow-in-the-dark thunder
beads, wasn't part of it. It's not funny.

52:47.668 --> 52:50.762
Do you have any idea
how important this is to me?

52:51.371 --> 52:54.966
And the Gay Gordons, pink haggis,
dildo saleswoman?

52:55.142 --> 52:57.440
Just understand something,
that Melissa set me up.

52:57.611 --> 53:01.069
Oh, please.
There's always an excuse with you.

53:01.515 --> 53:04.177
I never should've asked you
to do this in the first place.

53:04.351 --> 53:06.114
You don't even believe in marriage.

53:06.286 --> 53:08.015
You know, I might.

53:11.024 --> 53:12.753
I gotta get back.

53:26.006 --> 53:27.268
Melissa's pretty good.

53:27.441 --> 53:30.638
<i>Look, the whole goal here was to</i>
<i>convince Hannah that I'd grown up...</i>

53:30.811 --> 53:33.371
...that she doesn't know anything
about Colin...

53:33.547 --> 53:35.708
...that I'm the right man for her.

53:36.283 --> 53:37.841
That did not happen.

53:38.885 --> 53:42.412
Stella. No. No, baby,
don't eat buttons, okay?

53:42.589 --> 53:45.023
Yeah, but you're still
the maid of honor, right, Tom?

53:45.192 --> 53:46.716
I think she might have fired me.

53:46.893 --> 53:49.225
How does somebody get fired
from being maid of honor?

53:49.396 --> 53:50.420
Tell me about it.

53:50.597 --> 53:52.792
- You know what? I got an idea.
- Okay.

53:52.966 --> 53:54.763
<i>To prove</i>
<i>you're the only man for her...</i>

53:54.935 --> 53:57.028
<i>... we have to make you</i>
<i>the best maid of honor.</i>

53:57.204 --> 53:58.432
Right.

53:58.605 --> 54:02.041
I'm at a loss, completely stunned.
My guy couldn't find any dirt on Colin.

54:02.209 --> 54:04.109
This has never happened.
This guy's clean.

54:04.277 --> 54:07.144
- I'm glad it happened to me.
- He's got three Guinness Records?

54:07.314 --> 54:10.181
- Cool. For what?
- He's actually got a Medal of Honor.

54:10.484 --> 54:14.147
Hey, that's pretty funny because
we got the maid of honor right here.

54:15.789 --> 54:17.256
All right, let's stay focused.

54:17.424 --> 54:19.756
The point is,
we're not gonna get her off this guy.

54:19.926 --> 54:21.757
So we need to not make this
about Colin.

54:21.928 --> 54:23.862
- We need to make it about you.
- Good.

54:24.031 --> 54:26.499
Show her that you're growing up,
that you're changing.

54:26.666 --> 54:28.224
I am changing. I'm growing up.

54:28.402 --> 54:30.666
- Then this should be easy for you.
- Okay, great.

54:30.837 --> 54:34.102
These are bridal magazines
from 18 different countries...

54:34.274 --> 54:36.936
...each with a feature article
on being a maid of honor.

54:37.110 --> 54:38.668
Perfect. <i>Über Bride.</i>

54:38.845 --> 54:41.439
Now, I got these guys in Bangalore
that we outsource to.

54:41.615 --> 54:43.879
They translated them overnight
for you.

54:44.051 --> 54:46.542
Nice appetizer there, Gary.
Here's the main course.

54:46.720 --> 54:49.985
- What do you got for me? Bring it on.
- Deb, is an A-type personality.

54:50.157 --> 54:52.022
- She has to do everything perfect.
- Sure.

54:52.192 --> 54:53.591
Love her. Hate that about her.

54:53.760 --> 54:56.661
She rented this when
she was gonna be the maid of honor...

54:56.830 --> 54:59.128
...for her yoga teacher.
This is the goods.

54:59.299 --> 55:00.700
- Good, let's look at this.
- You're gonna be wowed.

55:00.700 --> 55:01.667
- Good, let's look at this.
- You're gonna be wowed.

55:09.976 --> 55:11.443
<i>Hi, I'm Elisabeth Hasselbeck...</i>

55:11.611 --> 55:14.102
<i>... and I'm so thrilled</i>
<i>you purchased this program.</i>

55:14.281 --> 55:17.182
<i>And I'm proud of you because</i>
<i>it shows that you're not happy...</i>

55:17.350 --> 55:19.716
<i>... being just an ordinary friend</i>
<i>and loved one.</i>

55:19.886 --> 55:21.854
<i>No, you and I
<i>are going to work together...</i></i>

55:22.022 --> 55:24.786
<i>... to make you</i>
<i>the perfect maid of honor.</i>

55:24.958 --> 55:27.449
<i>When we're through, you'll know</i>
<i>everything there is...</i>

55:27.627 --> 55:31.654
<i>... about dresses, crockery, nuptial</i>
<i>etiquette, and pleasing your bride.</i>

55:32.065 --> 55:34.124
What's the length
of the bridesmaid's dress?

55:34.301 --> 55:35.791
Can't be longer than bride's.

55:35.969 --> 55:37.834
What if someone
won't be able to attend?

55:38.004 --> 55:41.770
- You gotta send an invitation anyway.
- Receiving line?

55:41.942 --> 55:43.842
Receiving line?

55:44.010 --> 55:46.945
A receiving line means I've failed
because Hannah's married.

55:47.114 --> 55:48.638
It was a trick question.

55:48.815 --> 55:50.806
Who was
the runner-up MVP, 1974?

55:50.984 --> 55:52.542
These questions all have to do...

55:52.719 --> 55:55.279
...with Tom being
the best maid of honor he can be.

55:56.022 --> 55:58.422
I thought we were just asking,
like, questions.

55:59.226 --> 56:00.591
Go sit down.

56:00.760 --> 56:02.387
Basic duties
of the maid of honor?

56:02.562 --> 56:05.429
Manage the bridesmaids,
hold the ring, support the bride.

56:05.599 --> 56:07.863
Basic duties as you
as the maid of honor?

56:08.034 --> 56:11.265
Show that I've matured, that I can
take care of my responsibilities...

56:11.438 --> 56:13.429
...and that I need to destroy
from within.

56:13.607 --> 56:16.337
- What happens if you fail at that task?
- Colin gets her.

56:16.610 --> 56:18.771
What are we gonna do?
Steal the bride.

56:18.945 --> 56:20.674
What are we gonna do?
Steal the bride.

56:20.847 --> 56:23.281
- What are we gonna do?
- Steal the bride!

56:23.450 --> 56:25.475
Steal the bride!

56:25.652 --> 56:28.212
Remember, whether it's helping
with the seating chart...

56:28.388 --> 56:30.356
...or giving an opinion on the cake...

56:30.524 --> 56:32.788
<i>... the perfect made of honor</i>
<i>is with her bride...</i>

56:32.959 --> 56:34.790
<i>... every step of the way.</i>

56:34.961 --> 56:37.327
You didn't have to clear
your day to do all this.

56:37.497 --> 56:39.021
Are you kidding? Of course I did.

56:39.199 --> 56:42.259
The perfect maid of honor
is with his bride every step of the way.

56:42.435 --> 56:44.027
A changed man.

56:44.204 --> 56:45.933
I am, indeed.

56:46.439 --> 56:49.840
- I don't even know where to begin.
- When choosing your china patterns...

56:50.010 --> 56:52.035
...you need to think
about entertaining...

56:52.212 --> 56:54.180
...what sort of foods
you wanna cook.

56:56.850 --> 57:00.547
Here, look.
Now, don't be afraid to mix and match.

57:00.720 --> 57:03.416
It's important,
even with different styles and textures.

57:03.590 --> 57:05.854
What you wanna do
is stir up the table.

57:06.026 --> 57:08.551
Make it come alive
with color and finesse.

57:08.728 --> 57:10.320
That is the goal.

57:10.497 --> 57:13.057
All so, at the end of the day,
you will find...

57:15.402 --> 57:16.926
...connections.

57:18.004 --> 57:19.096
Thank you very much.

57:21.107 --> 57:24.907
Let's go. If you think I'm good
with plates, wait till you see linens.

57:25.078 --> 57:27.046
- Lingerie, perfect.
- What about the linens?

57:27.214 --> 57:29.114
Help pick something
for the wedding night.

57:29.282 --> 57:30.749
- No.
- Are you crazy?

57:30.917 --> 57:32.680
You're the perfect person
for this job.

57:32.852 --> 57:35.286
Who's taken off more lingerie
than you?

57:35.889 --> 57:38.187
Let's put your whoring to good use.

57:39.226 --> 57:40.716
Good point.

57:43.563 --> 57:45.827
So how did it go
with the Scottish Grand Council?

57:45.999 --> 57:49.230
Great.
Colin got them to approve everything.

57:49.402 --> 57:50.869
Great.

57:52.839 --> 57:55.399
So I gotta tell you,
I know this is gonna sound funny...

57:55.575 --> 57:58.305
...but I have to thank you.

57:58.478 --> 57:59.740
For what?

57:59.913 --> 58:02.677
Well, for asking me
to be your maid of honor.

58:02.849 --> 58:06.080
Yeah.
I know this is gonna sound crazy...

58:06.253 --> 58:10.519
...but you've really opened my eyes
to the whole idea of marriage.

58:10.690 --> 58:13.181
- Right.
- No, seriously.

58:13.960 --> 58:16.121
Have you met someone, Tom?

58:16.296 --> 58:20.164
- No.
- Well, then how can you be serious?

58:20.867 --> 58:22.664
I don't know. I just...

58:28.375 --> 58:30.002
I don't know.

58:48.328 --> 58:51.354
What do you think?
You think Colin will like it?

58:54.267 --> 58:57.259
No. No.

58:57.437 --> 58:59.405
- It's just...
- What?

59:00.607 --> 59:02.165
It's cute.

59:02.342 --> 59:05.573
"Cute"? I do not wanna look cute
on my wedding night.

59:05.745 --> 59:07.508
Just put this on. Cover yourself up.

59:07.681 --> 59:09.273
Oh, hey. That's my coat.

59:09.449 --> 59:11.713
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Thank you.

59:16.022 --> 59:18.582
Here, let me get you in a cab.
Watch...

59:19.125 --> 59:21.525
I can't believe
this is my last day in New York.

59:21.695 --> 59:23.356
What are you talking about?

59:24.731 --> 59:26.790
I've been meaning to tell you, Tom.

59:27.200 --> 59:29.862
When I leave tomorrow,
I'm not coming back.

59:31.271 --> 59:35.037
I've decided to move to Scotland
to be with Colin.

59:35.208 --> 59:36.675
- You're leaving New York?
- I am.

59:39.479 --> 59:41.913
It's exciting, you know,
and it makes sense.

59:42.082 --> 59:45.313
He's next in line to take over
the family business and...

59:45.885 --> 59:48.046
It's a whole new chapter.

59:52.792 --> 59:54.521
You were amazing today,
you know that?

59:54.694 --> 59:56.025
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

59:56.196 --> 59:58.061
I had no idea
you could juggle like that.

59:58.231 --> 01:00:00.529
- Yeah, well...
- I mean, women, yes, china, no.

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:03.567
- Yeah, I know.
- You're always amazing.

01:00:06.005 --> 01:00:07.472
Come.

01:00:13.947 --> 01:00:17.883
- I'll see you in Scotland soon, okay?
- Yeah, I'll see you over there.

01:00:20.987 --> 01:00:22.682
I'll miss you.

01:00:31.264 --> 01:00:33.357
Scotland.

01:00:42.976 --> 01:00:44.466
Come, baby.

01:00:48.748 --> 01:00:50.443
- Hi there.
- Hi.

01:00:50.617 --> 01:00:52.244
Hey.

01:00:53.153 --> 01:00:55.849
- Nice dogs.
- This is Hamish and this is Callum.

01:00:56.022 --> 01:00:58.786
- Callum? Callum.
- Yeah.

01:00:59.526 --> 01:01:01.255
- What dog is that?
- He's a Scottie.

01:01:01.428 --> 01:01:02.986
A Scottie.

01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:08.299
That's perfect. Fucking Scottie.

01:01:17.777 --> 01:01:21.235
I've never felt like this before.
So hopeless.

01:01:21.414 --> 01:01:24.781
So tell me again why you agreed
to be the maid of honor.

01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:27.918
To be with her. Make her happy.

01:01:28.087 --> 01:01:30.385
Figure out some way
to get her off of him.

01:01:30.557 --> 01:01:33.355
Maybe that was all wrong.
Maybe he's better for her than me.

01:01:33.526 --> 01:01:35.687
He's Scottish, he can dunk,
he's perfect.

01:01:35.862 --> 01:01:37.352
Nobody's perfect.

01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:40.124
Although I tell you,
this whiskey comes damn close.

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.291
It was a gift from Colin. He made it.

01:01:43.269 --> 01:01:44.736
Swell.

01:01:45.438 --> 01:01:49.704
I can't go.
I can't watch Hannah marry this guy.

01:01:50.343 --> 01:01:52.208
She's moving to Scotland,
I've lost her.

01:01:52.378 --> 01:01:54.778
- Crap.
- If you love something, set it free.

01:01:54.948 --> 01:01:57.508
Said by a pussy
and used by pussies ever since.

01:02:00.186 --> 01:02:02.279
<i>Casablanca.</i>
Bogie puts her on the plane.

01:02:02.455 --> 01:02:04.218
- Pussy.
- Bogie's a pussy?

01:02:04.524 --> 01:02:06.389
Big pussy.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.554
You know,
I've only truly been in love once.

01:02:09.896 --> 01:02:11.955
The most amazing woman
in the world.

01:02:12.131 --> 01:02:13.962
She was my best friend.

01:02:14.133 --> 01:02:18.263
But I was young, stupid,
and I messed it up.

01:02:18.605 --> 01:02:21.540
My great list of mistakes,
that was the greatest.

01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:24.139
- Who was this?
- Your mother.

01:02:26.112 --> 01:02:31.072
And when I finally realized how
stupid I was, I decided to fight for it...

01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:32.980
...but I was too late.

01:02:34.053 --> 01:02:36.248
She wouldn't take me back.

01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:37.847
And she was right.

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.319
And then it really was too late.

01:02:49.369 --> 01:02:51.132
By the way...

01:02:52.372 --> 01:02:53.862
...l'm getting another divorce.

01:02:58.745 --> 01:03:00.645
Oh, Pop.

01:03:05.184 --> 01:03:08.278
Hey. Go and get her, you pussy.

01:03:11.224 --> 01:03:12.316
What about the dresses?

01:03:12.492 --> 01:03:15.552
UPS is delivering tomorrow morning.
I gave you the tracking number.

01:03:15.728 --> 01:03:17.389
I got it, I got it, I got it.

01:03:18.464 --> 01:03:21.365
Okay, so Colin and Hannah are
gonna meet everyone at the house.

01:03:21.534 --> 01:03:23.365
Okay, great.

01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:25.403
- Thomas.
- Yeah.

01:03:25.572 --> 01:03:27.437
- Go get them, maid of honor.
- Yeah.

01:03:27.607 --> 01:03:29.541
Make this the perfect wedding.

01:03:30.376 --> 01:03:31.809
And steal the bride.

01:03:31.978 --> 01:03:34.469
Thanks, guys. Thanks.
Thanks for everything, man.

01:03:34.647 --> 01:03:36.877
- Thank you so much, all right?
- All right, baby.

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:40.247
All right, all right, all right.
Get out of here. I'll see you later.

01:03:49.195 --> 01:03:53.131
- This is like a fairy tale.
- Hannah is so lucky.

01:03:53.299 --> 01:03:55.665
- I know.
- I wish I was her.

01:03:55.835 --> 01:03:57.860
How she ever found
such a great guy...

01:03:58.037 --> 01:04:00.437
- We'll come visit her.
- All the time.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.960
Hey. Hey.

01:04:30.169 --> 01:04:31.864
What's your name?

01:04:32.271 --> 01:04:34.831
You're a pretty dog. Oh, I love you.

01:04:42.915 --> 01:04:45.884
- That's his house?
- No. Is this the summer house?

01:04:46.052 --> 01:04:48.316
The McMurrays
have homes for each season.

01:04:48.488 --> 01:04:50.388
This summer home is the smallest.

01:04:50.556 --> 01:04:52.956
They also have an autumn home,
winter home, spring...

01:04:53.126 --> 01:04:54.991
I know the seasons, buddy.

01:04:55.161 --> 01:04:56.628
Somebody's richer than you, Tom.

01:04:56.796 --> 01:05:00.061
I guess you gotta go
invent something even stupider.

01:05:29.762 --> 01:05:32.959
The entire castle was actually built
in 1220 in the 13th century.

01:05:33.132 --> 01:05:37.228
- This is incredible, isn't it?
- But around the 7th...

01:05:38.004 --> 01:05:41.064
Grandma Pearl, Joan,
this is my mother, Dierdre...

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.765
...and my father, Mungo.

01:05:46.145 --> 01:05:48.045
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

01:05:48.214 --> 01:05:50.512
Nice to meet you, Joan.
Nice to meet you. Welcome.

01:05:50.683 --> 01:05:53.311
I want you to meet someone
who is special to my Hannah...

01:05:53.486 --> 01:05:58.753
...and has been a lifelong friend,
and now her maid of honor: Tom.

01:05:58.925 --> 01:06:00.017
Yes.

01:06:00.193 --> 01:06:02.252
Did he just say
he's the maid of honor?

01:06:02.428 --> 01:06:03.520
He's a bloke.

01:06:03.696 --> 01:06:05.459
- How do you do?
- Very good, thank you.

01:06:05.631 --> 01:06:07.496
- Mungo.
- Mungo, pleasure. Thank you.

01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:08.861
Definitely gay.

01:06:09.035 --> 01:06:11.629
Oh, and these are the bridesmaids:

01:06:11.804 --> 01:06:13.863
Hilary, Stephanie and Melissa.

01:06:14.607 --> 01:06:16.199
- How do you do?
- Oh, hello.

01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:17.842
- Hi.
- Nice that you could come.

01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:19.637
How do you do?

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.605
How do you do?

01:06:24.183 --> 01:06:27.812
- So, what do you think?
- I think they think I'm gay.

01:06:27.987 --> 01:06:29.420
- What?
- Can we get together?

01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:30.613
Talk, catch up?

01:06:30.790 --> 01:06:32.758
Tom, Tom,
do you wanna see your chamber?

01:06:32.925 --> 01:06:35.359
- I'd love to. Thank you. Thank you.
- Follow me.

01:06:46.639 --> 01:06:48.038
Thank you.

01:06:49.275 --> 01:06:50.765
Thank you.

01:06:51.277 --> 01:06:52.505
Now, then.

01:06:52.678 --> 01:06:56.705
I think just a few more sprigs
of gypsophila at the front there.

01:06:56.883 --> 01:06:58.475
Lovely.

01:06:58.951 --> 01:07:00.009
What do you guys think?

01:07:00.186 --> 01:07:02.211
- Oh, it is gorgeous.
- You look amazing.

01:07:02.388 --> 01:07:04.049
- It is so pretty.
- With the veil...

01:07:04.223 --> 01:07:06.316
- It's so shiny, it's gorgeous.
- It's you.

01:07:06.492 --> 01:07:08.119
What do you think?

01:07:08.294 --> 01:07:09.693
Of?

01:07:09.862 --> 01:07:12.456
The hair. Yeah, it...

01:07:13.633 --> 01:07:16.101
This sash will go on the dress.

01:07:17.236 --> 01:07:19.363
- Really?
- Tradition.

01:07:22.642 --> 01:07:23.870
What's up with the hair?

01:07:24.043 --> 01:07:27.911
Well, I'm not entirely sure that...

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:31.015
No, you see, it's attached up here
with a lovely big...

01:07:31.184 --> 01:07:33.880
You're the maid of honor.
It's good to just be supportive...

01:07:34.053 --> 01:07:35.953
- I'm supportive.
- I don't think you are.

01:07:36.122 --> 01:07:37.612
- I think I am.
- No, listen to me.

01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:39.883
No, you're doing great,
you're doing great.

01:07:40.059 --> 01:07:41.526
Hannah.

01:07:42.061 --> 01:07:45.155
Actually, you know,
your hair looks amazing.

01:07:45.898 --> 01:07:48.162
- Really?
- Yes.

01:07:48.935 --> 01:07:52.234
The games will be starting soon.
Here are your costumes.

01:07:52.405 --> 01:07:53.429
Games?

01:07:53.606 --> 01:07:55.096
- Costumes.
- Our costumes?

01:07:55.274 --> 01:07:56.707
What do you mean "games"?

01:07:56.876 --> 01:07:58.275
Oh, the Highland Games.

01:07:58.711 --> 01:08:00.736
It's a tradition
in honor of the wedding.

01:08:00.913 --> 01:08:03.814
It goes right back to the time
when the groom had to prove...

01:08:03.983 --> 01:08:06.213
...that he was man enough
to deserve the bride.

01:08:06.385 --> 01:08:09.377
If he didn't win,
he didn't get the bride.

01:08:09.555 --> 01:08:11.648
No problem for my Colin.

01:08:16.328 --> 01:08:20.129
<i>Welcome, one and all,</i>
<i>to the Highland Games.</i>

01:08:20.466 --> 01:08:23.731
<i>Men have traveled from</i>
<i>all four corners of this great country...</i>

01:08:23.903 --> 01:08:26.736
<i>... to compete</i>
<i>in feats of strength and agility.</i>

01:08:26.906 --> 01:08:30.069
<i>But only one warrior</i>
<i>will be man enough to claim the bride.</i>

01:08:33.312 --> 01:08:35.303
<i>One competitor</i>
<i>who needs no introduction...</i>

01:08:35.481 --> 01:08:37.948
<i>... is our very own Colin McMurray.</i>

01:08:38.117 --> 01:08:40.745
- Doesn't my Colin look handsome?
- <i>Coming up the rear...</i>

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:46.381
<i>... all the way from America,</i>
<i>Hannah's maid of honor, Tom...</i>

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:48.926
<i>... who I think you'll agree...</i>

01:08:49.095 --> 01:08:52.029
<i>... is wearing a rather fetching</i>
<i>wee minikilt.</i>

01:08:53.099 --> 01:08:54.999
Who was in charge of that?

01:08:55.167 --> 01:08:56.725
I have no idea.

01:08:56.903 --> 01:08:59.701
Yeah, you're sexy!

01:09:19.625 --> 01:09:21.957
<i>Everybody giving their all.</i>

01:09:22.595 --> 01:09:24.721
<i>And we're running neck and neck.</i>

01:09:24.897 --> 01:09:28.799
<i>A Scotsman against a Yank.</i>

01:09:29.535 --> 01:09:33.301
Ladies and gentlemen, the result
of today's Highland Games...

01:09:33.471 --> 01:09:35.303
<i>... rests upon the caber toss.</i>

01:09:35.474 --> 01:09:38.443
<i>The competition</i>
<i>is down to two competitors.</i>

01:09:38.611 --> 01:09:42.011
- A tree. We're tossing a tree?
- Yeah.

01:09:44.684 --> 01:09:46.015
<i>What a toss.</i>

01:09:46.419 --> 01:09:48.011
<i>What a toss.</i>

01:09:48.187 --> 01:09:49.848
- Way to go, Colin.
- He's strong.

01:09:50.022 --> 01:09:53.082
<i>Well, then, Tom.</i>
<i>Let's see what you're made of.</i>

01:09:53.792 --> 01:09:56.626
<i>The whole competition</i>
<i>rests on this throw.</i>

01:09:56.796 --> 01:09:59.230
Look alive, lassie.

01:10:03.602 --> 01:10:05.832
Come on, Tom. Oh, gosh.

01:10:06.839 --> 01:10:09.967
Okay, I can do this. I can do this.
Okay, here we go.

01:10:11.444 --> 01:10:14.038
Okay. Okay, okay. I got it.

01:10:14.213 --> 01:10:17.649
Okay. Okay. Here we go.
Here we go.

01:10:19.285 --> 01:10:21.776
Watch your step. Watch your step.
Watch your step.

01:10:36.836 --> 01:10:41.068
<i>Oh, dear.</i>
<i>That's gonna cost the Yank the girl.</i>

01:10:42.408 --> 01:10:44.706
What an ass.

01:10:44.877 --> 01:10:49.541
And the winner of the Highland Games
is our very own Colin McMurray!

01:10:56.489 --> 01:10:59.117
Great, lad! Good on you.

01:11:00.359 --> 01:11:01.849
That's great.

01:11:43.069 --> 01:11:45.731
Well done, my boy. Well done.

01:11:48.507 --> 01:11:51.806
- So cute.
- Well done, my boy.

01:12:00.853 --> 01:12:05.847
Robert Burns, who wrote that song,
is Scotland's most famous poet.

01:12:08.894 --> 01:12:12.386
No, Auntie, we haven't had any bairns
yet, so we haven't got any names.

01:12:12.565 --> 01:12:14.157
Bairns means children.

01:12:14.333 --> 01:12:17.962
I'm so sorry, I'm having a hard
time understanding your accent.

01:12:18.137 --> 01:12:20.230
- Athol.
- Excuse me?

01:12:20.973 --> 01:12:23.032
It's a name for the children.

01:12:23.209 --> 01:12:24.767
- Athol.
- Athol.

01:12:26.178 --> 01:12:27.975
Little Athol.

01:12:29.582 --> 01:12:33.382
Yeah, no,
we won't be naming our child Athol.

01:12:33.552 --> 01:12:35.645
Maybe when he's a teenager.

01:12:35.821 --> 01:12:37.812
My mother's cousin
was the Duke of Athol.

01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:40.754
We're a long line of Athols.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.487
Well, maybe we'll keep it
in the mix, eh?

01:12:43.662 --> 01:12:45.129
Maybe as a middle name?

01:12:58.544 --> 01:13:00.341
So, Hannah,
do you like the venison?

01:13:00.513 --> 01:13:02.481
It's delicious.

01:13:03.315 --> 01:13:05.545
Colin shot it. He's a wonderful shot.

01:13:05.718 --> 01:13:07.982
Oh, stop, Mom,
you'll make me blush.

01:13:08.154 --> 01:13:10.520
And this is the moment,
I've just remembered.

01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:12.216
What moment's that?

01:13:12.391 --> 01:13:15.622
When Colin killed the deer.
I filmed it.

01:13:19.565 --> 01:13:21.123
Right between the eyes.

01:13:24.103 --> 01:13:28.130
In fact, everything we are eating
this evening, Colin has killed.

01:13:29.909 --> 01:13:31.171
- Colin.
- To Colin.

01:13:31.377 --> 01:13:33.675
In your honor, Hannah.

01:13:34.146 --> 01:13:35.909
That is so thoughtful.

01:13:36.615 --> 01:13:39.607
I'm so sorry
I didn't kill anything for you.

01:13:46.458 --> 01:13:49.791
Oh, gosh. What did you get?

01:13:50.262 --> 01:13:52.492
Oh, I love chocolate.

01:13:52.665 --> 01:13:54.428
Don't... Don't do that.

01:13:55.267 --> 01:13:56.791
If you want some...

01:13:58.504 --> 01:14:01.200
Here. Give you some.

01:14:01.373 --> 01:14:02.806
Okay?

01:14:11.383 --> 01:14:13.044
Excuse me. Hi.

01:14:13.219 --> 01:14:14.743
Reverend.

01:14:16.021 --> 01:14:18.649
Excuse me. Sorry to... There you go.

01:14:18.824 --> 01:14:20.553
- A wonderful dinner.
- Delighted, Tom.

01:14:20.726 --> 01:14:23.991
- And your wife is looking for you.
- Oh, thank you very much.

01:14:24.396 --> 01:14:26.591
- Nice one.
- Cheers.

01:14:27.866 --> 01:14:30.300
A little birdie tells me
Colin personally slayed...

01:14:30.469 --> 01:14:32.801
...each one of these reindeer heads.

01:14:32.972 --> 01:14:34.496
- Tom.
- You're right.

01:14:34.673 --> 01:14:38.131
When I say a little birdie told me,
he would've told me, but Colin shot it.

01:14:38.677 --> 01:14:42.977
Listen, seriously. Can we go
somewhere private and talk?

01:14:43.148 --> 01:14:45.446
- It's important.
- Yeah.

01:14:46.452 --> 01:14:48.147
Shall we go?

01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:52.789
Bagpipes.

01:14:53.993 --> 01:14:56.461
Oh, my God.

01:14:56.629 --> 01:14:58.620
You know,
he's been playing the bagpipes...

01:14:58.797 --> 01:15:02.790
...ever since he was 3 years old.
Practices every night.

01:15:02.968 --> 01:15:05.596
- Every night?
- Never misses.

01:15:08.907 --> 01:15:10.932
What kind of necklace is that?

01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:14.079
They're glow-in-the-dark
thunder beads.

01:15:27.192 --> 01:15:31.151
- Oh, hi, Mom.
- I have something for you.

01:15:34.033 --> 01:15:35.864
Some evening, huh?

01:15:36.035 --> 01:15:37.525
Yes.

01:15:39.204 --> 01:15:42.571
This is so you can have
a little piece of home with you.

01:15:42.741 --> 01:15:44.265
Thank you.

01:15:47.446 --> 01:15:49.380
Look at you.

01:15:50.282 --> 01:15:51.806
There's you and Melissa.

01:15:51.984 --> 01:15:54.817
You were about 5 there.

01:15:57.156 --> 01:15:59.124
Oh, do you remember this?

01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:02.021
It was taken at the lake
when your father broke his arm...

01:16:02.194 --> 01:16:05.186
...because of that
silly motorcycle of his.

01:16:05.364 --> 01:16:06.729
I miss Dad so much.

01:16:07.132 --> 01:16:08.724
Me too, sweetheart.

01:16:09.101 --> 01:16:11.729
I just wish he could've been here.

01:16:11.904 --> 01:16:14.668
He was always so worried
I was never gonna meet anyone.

01:16:15.174 --> 01:16:16.334
Oh, no, he wasn't.

01:16:16.508 --> 01:16:17.998
Oh, that's Paris.

01:16:18.177 --> 01:16:20.668
He could be so off-base sometimes.

01:16:20.846 --> 01:16:21.904
What?

01:16:22.314 --> 01:16:25.374
Well,
it's just he was always convinced...

01:16:25.551 --> 01:16:27.314
...that you were gonna marry Tom.

01:16:28.721 --> 01:16:30.120
Really?

01:16:32.925 --> 01:16:35.018
I'll see you in the morning.

01:16:35.194 --> 01:16:37.128
Good night, my angel.

01:16:39.565 --> 01:16:42.898
<i>It's pulling of a Band-Aid. You just</i>
<i>have to close your eyes and do it.</i>

01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:46.735
But I just haven't found
the right time.

01:16:46.905 --> 01:16:49.032
<i>What are you talking about,</i>
<i>"right time"?</i>

01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:52.666
Any time is the right time to say
"I love you. Marry me."

01:16:53.679 --> 01:16:56.204
- Right.
- Come on, what are you there for?

01:16:56.582 --> 01:16:59.642
Take the shot, win the game,
and bring her home.

01:16:59.818 --> 01:17:03.310
And stop running up my long-distance
phone bill with these crazy calls.

01:17:03.489 --> 01:17:06.925
Right. Right, right, okay.
Thanks, Felix.

01:17:07.359 --> 01:17:09.884
You can do this, Tom.
You can do this, you can do this.

01:17:10.062 --> 01:17:12.792
What's wrong with me?
You can do this. You can do this.

01:17:25.177 --> 01:17:26.269
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:17:26.445 --> 01:17:29.539
Hey, I thought we could go for a walk
and work on the vows.

01:17:29.715 --> 01:17:31.649
- Good idea. I could use some help.
- Yeah.

01:17:31.817 --> 01:17:33.250
Good, okay.

01:17:36.221 --> 01:17:38.314
- What do you think?
- I think a lot of things.

01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:41.220
I've been working on them,
I think they're getting worse.

01:17:41.393 --> 01:17:44.658
At first I went for the emotion,
then I thought, what if Colin doesn't?

01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:46.923
I tried to be funny.
I don't know if Scots...

01:17:47.099 --> 01:17:49.158
...have the same sense of humor
as Americans.

01:17:49.334 --> 01:17:50.699
I'm back to something basic.

01:17:50.869 --> 01:17:53.565
- I veered off into something boring.
- I'm crazy about you.

01:17:53.739 --> 01:17:57.607
I think about you all the time. I want
to spend the rest of my life with you.

01:17:57.776 --> 01:18:00.142
- Really?
- Really.

01:18:01.013 --> 01:18:02.173
That's so generic.

01:18:02.681 --> 01:18:04.842
- Generic? Generic?
- Yeah.

01:18:05.017 --> 01:18:07.008
- It totally is.
- How can that be generic?

01:18:07.186 --> 01:18:09.051
It sounds like something to say...

01:18:09.221 --> 01:18:11.712
...as opposed
to what you're really feeling.

01:18:15.093 --> 01:18:16.993
All right, how about...

01:18:20.265 --> 01:18:24.201
Nobody in the world
makes me laugh the way you do.

01:18:25.604 --> 01:18:26.696
You're my best friend.

01:18:29.942 --> 01:18:31.603
I just want to be with you.

01:18:38.817 --> 01:18:43.049
Look out, look out, look out!
There she is! Hannah, let's go!

01:18:43.222 --> 01:18:44.587
What is this?

01:18:44.756 --> 01:18:46.781
- This is her "taking out."
- Her what?

01:18:46.959 --> 01:18:49.894
We dress her up and then
we parade her around one of the pubs.

01:18:50.062 --> 01:18:51.859
- That's weird.
- It's tradition.

01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:56.467
And then we fill a toilet with salt
and we sell your kisses for change.

01:18:57.002 --> 01:19:00.403
- Really? They sell your kisses?
- Yup.

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:04.006
Come on,
it's like a Scottish bachelorette party.

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:23.291
Okay, come on.

01:19:33.972 --> 01:19:37.999
All right, let's sell some kisses!

01:19:43.549 --> 01:19:46.746
It's her taking out.
She's got the breath of an angel.

01:20:35.667 --> 01:20:37.396
- Another.
- Another.

01:20:37.569 --> 01:20:38.627
Thank you!

01:20:42.841 --> 01:20:44.775
This is all I have.

01:21:29.855 --> 01:21:32.050
- Oh, my gosh, you guys!
- What?

01:21:32.224 --> 01:21:34.317
Don't drop your pot.

01:21:34.493 --> 01:21:36.723
- We have to get more kisses!
- Kisses!

01:21:36.895 --> 01:21:40.331
- More kisses.
- Kisses.

01:22:44.696 --> 01:22:46.891
- I can't take it anymore.
- What are you doing?

01:22:47.065 --> 01:22:49.966
- Let's do it again. For old times' sake.
- Don't take that off.

01:22:50.135 --> 01:22:52.399
No, Tom,
I need to make this up to you.

01:22:52.571 --> 01:22:53.629
Don't take this...

01:22:54.139 --> 01:22:57.506
- No, I'm really unhappy.
- That's fine.

01:22:57.676 --> 01:23:00.304
- No, it's okay.
- Tom, I'm not happy at all.

01:23:00.479 --> 01:23:05.041
And I am in a really,
really confusing place...

01:23:05.217 --> 01:23:08.015
...in my life right now.

01:23:08.186 --> 01:23:11.485
- Confusing?
- Listen, I have had some whiskey...

01:23:11.656 --> 01:23:14.784
- I can tell.
...and I need you to service me.

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:17.861
- Service you? Service you?
- Service me, bitch!

01:23:18.029 --> 01:23:19.053
Service me!

01:23:19.231 --> 01:23:21.529
- Be quiet. Be quiet.
- You be quiet.

01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:25.636
- Get off of me. Just be quiet.
- You get down.

01:23:26.404 --> 01:23:28.531
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet! You be...

01:23:30.542 --> 01:23:33.340
Don't! Get off!

01:23:34.613 --> 01:23:36.774
Wait! Wait!

01:23:37.382 --> 01:23:39.475
Bring me more whiskeys.

01:23:43.021 --> 01:23:44.682
Hannah!

01:23:44.856 --> 01:23:47.120
It's Tom, let me in. Let me in.

01:23:47.292 --> 01:23:49.817
- Go away, Tom.
- No, no, no, let me explain.

01:23:49.995 --> 01:23:52.054
- It's not what you think.
- It doesn't matter.

01:23:52.230 --> 01:23:54.164
- Yes, it does.
- Just go.

01:23:54.332 --> 01:23:57.301
I'll go. Just tell me,
why did you come to my room?

01:24:00.572 --> 01:24:03.939
Hannah?
Why did you come to the room?

01:24:04.109 --> 01:24:06.043
To talk about that kiss.

01:24:09.047 --> 01:24:10.537
Oh, Hannah.

01:24:13.318 --> 01:24:15.946
Please don't... Don't marry him.

01:24:17.055 --> 01:24:19.785
- All these years, Tom.
- Don't marry him.

01:24:19.958 --> 01:24:23.826
All this time.
You're doing this now?

01:24:24.429 --> 01:24:26.920
- I know.
- How can you do this?

01:24:27.098 --> 01:24:30.295
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just let me in.
- No, I can't.

01:24:30.836 --> 01:24:31.860
Let me in.

01:24:32.237 --> 01:24:35.468
You're only doing this now
because you're afraid of losing me.

01:24:39.711 --> 01:24:42.805
I need someone
who's gonna be there for me...

01:24:43.481 --> 01:24:45.608
...no matter what happens.

01:24:49.287 --> 01:24:53.155
Someone who truly loves me.

01:24:56.695 --> 01:24:58.720
Someone I can trust.

01:25:06.238 --> 01:25:09.332
I'm marrying Colin tomorrow...

01:25:09.507 --> 01:25:10.531
...Tom.

01:25:29.127 --> 01:25:31.220
I can't be your maid of honor.

01:25:33.064 --> 01:25:35.157
I can't give you away.

01:25:43.174 --> 01:25:45.039
I'm sorry, Hannah.

01:25:46.978 --> 01:25:49.310
I'm sorry you and Tom had a fight.

01:25:50.482 --> 01:25:52.473
I'm his best friend.

01:25:53.351 --> 01:25:55.717
He's just afraid of losing me.

01:25:58.223 --> 01:26:01.715
- He'll get over it.
- Aye.

01:26:30.922 --> 01:26:33.254
- Can you just suck it? Suck it.
- Okay, okay. I am.

01:26:33.425 --> 01:26:35.757
Suck it in. Breathe in. More.

01:26:35.927 --> 01:26:39.158
- Pull it! You can get into it!
- Pull it! I'll pull it tighter!

01:26:39.331 --> 01:26:44.359
I'll hold, you zip it together.
Come on! One, two.

01:26:44.536 --> 01:26:46.629
Three!

01:26:47.939 --> 01:26:49.429
It didn't...

01:26:49.607 --> 01:26:51.336
- Oh, my God, it fits.
- It fits!

01:26:51.509 --> 01:26:53.807
Oh, it fits! It fits.

01:26:53.979 --> 01:26:55.674
Up top.

01:27:25.677 --> 01:27:29.010
- Why are we stopping?
- Unruly flock.

01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:30.408
What?

01:28:14.359 --> 01:28:15.986
I remember you.

01:28:17.128 --> 01:28:18.561
Hey.

01:28:30.041 --> 01:28:32.202
I love you too.

01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:34.000
Thank you.

01:28:35.447 --> 01:28:38.109
Turn around. I have to go back.

01:29:07.846 --> 01:29:08.870
Oh, no.

01:29:09.047 --> 01:29:11.607
Shit. Shit! Shit!

01:29:11.983 --> 01:29:13.575
Hey! I need another ferry boat.

01:29:13.751 --> 01:29:15.616
- We've only got the one ferry.
- What?

01:29:15.787 --> 01:29:19.052
It's waiting over there
for the ceremony to finish.

01:29:19.224 --> 01:29:21.658
- Is there another way to get there?
- You can drive.

01:29:21.826 --> 01:29:23.817
- Drive. How long?
- About an hour and a half.

01:29:23.995 --> 01:29:25.895
- That's too long.
- You can swim.

01:29:26.064 --> 01:29:29.625
You can go on foot around the shore.
But that would take a wee while.

01:29:29.801 --> 01:29:31.166
Foot.

01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:35.234
A horse. Horse.
Hey, I need your horse.

01:29:35.406 --> 01:29:36.964
- My horse?
- Yes.

01:29:37.742 --> 01:29:40.768
- Hey, come down from there, you.
- I need to get to the church.

01:29:40.945 --> 01:29:43.607
What do you think you're planning?
You'll hurt yourself.

01:29:43.781 --> 01:29:46.147
I'll give you 3 cents
for every coffee collar used.

01:29:46.317 --> 01:29:48.410
Do you have any idea
how much money that is?

01:29:48.586 --> 01:29:51.817
- Good luck to you. Her name's Nancy.
- Thanks. Nancy. Let's go!

01:29:56.494 --> 01:29:57.961
Stick to the shoreline.

01:29:58.563 --> 01:30:01.999
Past the monument.
The church is on the left.

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:07.233
What in the name of the wee man
is a coffee collar?

01:30:08.173 --> 01:30:09.538
Easy.

01:30:14.312 --> 01:30:17.543
Let's just pin
these nice pressed pleats.

01:30:17.715 --> 01:30:22.414
And it goes across the dress,
it looks really beautiful. It's our tartan.

01:30:38.303 --> 01:30:39.964
That's it.

01:30:45.677 --> 01:30:47.838
Please be seated.

01:30:49.914 --> 01:30:52.075
We are gathered here
in the sight of God...

01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:55.083
Boys, give me your pins. Pins.

01:30:55.253 --> 01:30:57.448
- to join together this man
and this wo...

01:31:02.894 --> 01:31:05.124
This is a celebration of love.

01:31:05.797 --> 01:31:09.699
For Colin, it's through the memories
of seeing his parents' love as a child.

01:31:09.867 --> 01:31:12.734
- It's very nice.
- And for Hannah...

01:31:12.904 --> 01:31:15.702
...it's through the paintings
of Modigliani.

01:31:15.873 --> 01:31:18.774
<i>Therefore, if any man</i>
<i>can show just cause...</i>

01:31:18.943 --> 01:31:21.741
<i>... why they may not</i>
<i>be lawfully joined together...</i>

01:31:21.913 --> 01:31:24.780
...let him now speak
or forever hold his peace.

01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:33.823
Tom?

01:31:41.266 --> 01:31:45.168
Tom? Tom?

01:31:45.336 --> 01:31:48.863
Tom. Tom.

01:31:49.707 --> 01:31:51.265
Tom.

01:31:52.410 --> 01:31:54.173
Tom.

01:31:56.381 --> 01:31:58.611
Tom. Are you okay?

01:31:58.783 --> 01:32:00.478
Yeah, I think so.

01:32:00.652 --> 01:32:02.984
Tom, what are you doing here?

01:32:03.154 --> 01:32:05.520
- I have to tell you something.
- Yeah.

01:32:05.690 --> 01:32:06.850
Hannah...

01:32:09.427 --> 01:32:11.258
- Your hair looks awful.
- It does?

01:32:11.429 --> 01:32:12.487
- Yeah.
- What?

01:32:12.664 --> 01:32:14.256
And the sash...

01:32:15.333 --> 01:32:16.800
...it sucks.

01:32:17.001 --> 01:32:18.559
Oh, no.

01:32:18.736 --> 01:32:20.601
But that hair...

01:32:21.606 --> 01:32:23.665
...it's like a co-op for parakeets.

01:32:23.841 --> 01:32:25.365
What?

01:32:25.543 --> 01:32:28.103
Look, Hannah.

01:32:28.279 --> 01:32:31.874
You know, I pride myself
on being honest with everybody.

01:32:32.050 --> 01:32:35.247
But there's somebody
I've been lying to for a very long time:

01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:36.978
Myself.

01:32:38.056 --> 01:32:40.024
Because the truth is...

01:32:40.191 --> 01:32:41.351
Is scary.

01:32:42.393 --> 01:32:45.726
And 10 years ago,
I got in bed with the wrong girl.

01:32:46.331 --> 01:32:48.799
She turned out to be the right one.

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.839
I love you, Hannah.

01:32:58.109 --> 01:32:59.736
I always have.

01:33:00.278 --> 01:33:02.303
And I always will.

01:33:04.015 --> 01:33:05.949
Thomas Bailey...

01:33:06.551 --> 01:33:10.248
...you are the worst
maid of honor of all time.

01:33:36.347 --> 01:33:37.974
Oh, no.

01:33:50.862 --> 01:33:52.295
I'm...

01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:54.622
...so...

01:33:57.235 --> 01:33:59.703
...very truly sorry.

01:34:05.676 --> 01:34:07.439
I don't expect you to ever forgive me.

01:34:13.151 --> 01:34:15.016
Just so you know...

01:34:16.654 --> 01:34:18.713
...you are the perfect guy.

01:34:21.058 --> 01:34:22.787
Just not the perfect guy for me.

01:34:36.841 --> 01:34:38.103
Goodbye, Hannah.

01:34:40.645 --> 01:34:42.203
Colin.

01:34:46.717 --> 01:34:47.809
What'd she say?

01:34:48.219 --> 01:34:50.653
- She said I should deck you.
- Yeah, that makes sense.

01:34:54.926 --> 01:34:56.188
Asshole.

01:35:11.476 --> 01:35:12.500
I do.

01:35:12.677 --> 01:35:16.579
And, Tom, do you take Hannah
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:35:16.747 --> 01:35:18.305
I do.

01:35:18.483 --> 01:35:20.451
Now, this is the moment.

01:35:23.421 --> 01:35:26.515
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:35:26.691 --> 01:35:30.183
At last, you may kiss your bride.

01:35:55.253 --> 01:35:56.948
Oh, my gosh.

01:35:57.388 --> 01:35:59.788
- Number six?
- Seven.

01:36:01.058 --> 01:36:04.391
You're absolutely glowing tonight,
Grandma Pearl.

01:36:04.562 --> 01:36:06.393
Thank you.

01:36:06.931 --> 01:36:09.700
It's very nice of you to say so.

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:09.927
It's very nice of you to say so.

01:36:20.878 --> 01:36:22.402
What are you doing?

01:36:25.216 --> 01:36:27.616
I'm just making sure
I got the right girl this time.

01:36:27.785 --> 01:36:31.118
You do. Definitely.

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.321
Oh, Monica.

01:36:38.496 --> 01:36:41.007
Oh, Bill.
