<i>Losing Diana was like</i>
<i>losing a part of me.</i>

01:38.398 --> 01:42.698
<i>I thought nothing could change</i>
<i>the way we felt about each other.</i>

01:43.336 --> 01:45.770
<i>I thought we were invincible.</i>

01:47.507 --> 01:52.740
<i>Someone once said, "If you want</i>
<i>something very badly, set it free. "</i>

01:52.879 --> 01:57.077
<i>"If it comes back to you,</i>
<i>it's yours for ever. "</i>

01:57.217 --> 02:01.517
<i>"If it doesn't,</i>
<i>it was never yours to begin with. "</i>

02:02.889 --> 02:06.655
<i>I knew one thing.</i>
<i>I was David's to begin with.</i>

02:06.793 --> 02:08.783
<i>And he was mine.</i>

02:10.729 --> 02:13.756
Light up my life...

02:15.101 --> 02:19.538
<i>We met in high school. David was</i>
<i>a senior and I was a freshman.</i>

02:19.672 --> 02:23.699
<i>After glee club, he'd drive me and</i>
<i>my best friend home from school.</i>

02:24.410 --> 02:27.470
<i>I used to watch him</i>
<i>in the rear-view mirror.</i>

02:27.614 --> 02:29.707
<i>I fell in love with his eyes.</i>

02:35.989 --> 02:40.551
<i>When I was 19 David proposed to</i>
<i>me on the pier at Paradise Cove.</i>

02:40.693 --> 02:42.456
<i>Our parents were against it.</i>

02:42.595 --> 02:45.587
<i>They said we were too young,</i>
<i>we didn't know each other.</i>

02:46.833 --> 02:51.429
<i>But David said that a life</i>
<i>without risk is like no life at all.</i>

02:51.571 --> 02:54.039
<i>So we eloped.</i>

03:11.491 --> 03:16.155
<i>I graduated from architecture school</i>
<i>and got a job at a small firm.</i>

03:16.296 --> 03:19.595
<i>Diana helped support us</i>
<i>by selling real estate.</i>

03:20.366 --> 03:24.268
<i>I spent all my free time</i>
<i>working on a design of my own.</i>

03:24.404 --> 03:27.771
<i>It summed up everything about</i>
<i>architecture that really mattered</i>.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.967
<i>It was my dream house.</i>

04:03.543 --> 04:05.272
D?

04:07.880 --> 04:10.371
Have I ever told you I love you?

04:12.018 --> 04:13.713
No.

04:13.853 --> 04:16.286
- I do.
- Still?

04:17.357 --> 04:19.188
Always.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.958
<i>We had our differences.</i>

04:24.097 --> 04:28.898
<i>He'd take his clothes off and leave</i>
<i>them on the floor. It made me crazy.</i>

04:50.089 --> 04:53.616
What do you think this is?
Leaving your shoes on the table?

04:53.760 --> 04:57.594
- I don't need to do your laundry.
- I'll pick it up. Don't get violent.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.665
- What about this?
- Now, you put that down.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.894
- You're gonna hurt somebody.
- I'm gonna hurt somebody?

05:04.037 --> 05:06.335
You're outta your mind!

05:06.472 --> 05:08.667
OK, now. Fine.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.745
Goddamn it!

05:13.880 --> 05:16.940
Now, come on. Let's just relax.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.415
- Did I hurt you?
- No. I'm all right.

05:19.552 --> 05:23.511
- I'm sorry.
- Really? You were kidding?

06:05.631 --> 06:08.566
D, your pants are on fire.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.793
You have no idea.

06:28.221 --> 06:32.885
<i>We had no money, so for entertainment</i>
<i>David showed me architecture he liked.</i>

06:33.025 --> 06:35.084
<i>But sometimes I'd have to ask,</i>

06:35.228 --> 06:37.924
<i>"Why are we looking at</i>
<i>a stupid car wash?"</i>

06:38.064 --> 06:41.397
<i>And he'd just say, "No, not stupid."</i>

06:41.534 --> 06:44.162
<i>"Don't just use your eyes."</i>

06:44.303 --> 06:47.295
<i>He made me look at things</i>
<i>differently.</i>

06:49.142 --> 06:53.010
David, this is a steal. It just came in.
Nobody knows about it yet.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.408
It's beautiful.

06:54.547 --> 06:57.209
Build a house here.
You'd make a name for yourself,

06:57.350 --> 07:00.877
because the house will be brilliant,
being by David Murphy.

07:01.020 --> 07:05.320
<i>I found an incredible piece of property</i>
<i>in Santa Monica, by the ocean.</i>

07:05.458 --> 07:08.222
<i>It was the perfect site</i>
<i>for David's house.</i>

07:08.361 --> 07:10.158
We'll borrow the money.

07:10.296 --> 07:14.426
These leverage stockbroker buyout
guys, you should see the junk they buy.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.730
They would go crazy
for a house of yours.

07:17.870 --> 07:22.705
<i>It was brilliant, even though</i>
<i>I didn't understand a word of it.</i>

07:22.842 --> 07:25.037
<i>We had to economise</i>
<i>for the loan payments,</i>

07:25.178 --> 07:28.204
<i>but it was our future</i>
<i>and I got to build my house.</i>

07:32.985 --> 07:34.714
<i>And then the recession hit.</i>

07:35.555 --> 07:40.993
<i>The real-estate market dried up.</i>
<i>I hadn't closed a sale in six months.</i>

07:41.127 --> 07:43.493
<i>Construction fell to its lowest point</i>
<i>in years.</i>

07:43.629 --> 07:47.156
<i>People were being laid off everywhere,</i>
<i>and I was one of them.</i>

07:47.300 --> 07:51.100
- I feel really bad about this.
- I don't understand. What happened?

07:51.237 --> 07:54.172
The bank has called in
the demand note.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.797
Can they do that?

07:55.942 --> 08:00.436
You don't have any income right now,
so they could attach your assets.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.577
What assets?

08:06.586 --> 08:08.281
Your house.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.689
Gotta keep up those payments.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.256
I'm sorry.

08:27.540 --> 08:30.134
David, I'm scared.

08:33.412 --> 08:38.280
We don't have any money.
What are we gonna do?

08:42.621 --> 08:47.252
I'll wait tables or drive a cab
or something. I don't know.

08:55.034 --> 08:58.765
I'll take care of you.

09:01.507 --> 09:03.338
Make it go away.

09:10.983 --> 09:14.214
<i>I was desperate.</i>
<i>We stood to lose everything:</i>

09:14.353 --> 09:17.948
<i>The house I'd been building,</i>
<i>even our own home.</i>

09:18.090 --> 09:21.890
<i>I swallowed my pride and borrowed</i>
<i>$5,000 from my father.</i>

09:22.028 --> 09:24.724
<i>It wasn't enough.</i>

09:24.864 --> 09:27.389
<i>We needed $50,000.</i>

09:39.078 --> 09:41.740
- D...
- What?

09:41.881 --> 09:46.375
- Get up. Get dressed. I got an idea.
- What time is it?

10:12.945 --> 10:15.641
Hi! How ya doin'?

10:20.920 --> 10:23.718
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, my God!

10:23.856 --> 10:25.847
Oh, honey!
That's the spirit!

10:25.992 --> 10:30.019
Keep 'em coming! 50,000 of 'em,
that's what we want! We're winners!

10:38.971 --> 10:41.030
Put some money in the kitty!

10:44.744 --> 10:49.044
We got a shooter now, folks.
A lucky lady shooter.

10:49.181 --> 10:51.843
Stack it, don't rack it.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.943
And I have a lovely...

12:50.870 --> 12:55.671
Why don't you put it on?
It suits you.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.771
Well, I can't afford it.

13:01.213 --> 13:05.115
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

13:09.288 --> 13:14.817
I really think you ought
to have the dress. Let me buy it for you.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.793
You wanna buy me this dress?

13:17.930 --> 13:19.693
Yeah.

13:20.699 --> 13:24.499
- Why?
- I've enjoyed watching you.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.934
You've earned it.

13:28.774 --> 13:30.901
No, I haven't.

13:33.245 --> 13:36.112
The dress is for sale. I'm not.

13:50.029 --> 13:52.691
Roll 'em now, girlfriend!

14:04.210 --> 14:07.111
I can't lose. I'm up over $9,000.

14:15.487 --> 14:18.354
$9,000 up! This is my wife D.

14:18.490 --> 14:21.755
These are my girls.
They're gonna be moving in.

14:23.162 --> 14:25.027
Kiss 'em.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.931
- Yeah.
- Bets, please.

14:42.181 --> 14:44.081
- Did I ever tell you I love you?
- No.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.478
- I do.
- Still?

14:45.618 --> 14:47.017
Always.

15:06.805 --> 15:08.568
5,000.

15:08.707 --> 15:12.871
This little pile here, you guessed it.
Five more, D.

15:13.012 --> 15:15.742
What do you think this is?
Five more.

15:15.881 --> 15:20.909
Play with it. Roll around with it.
Enjoy yourself. Oh, my!

15:23.489 --> 15:26.652
And the grand total is...

15:29.061 --> 15:32.861
...$25,040.

15:32.998 --> 15:36.195
So we're halfway there, like in an hour.

15:36.335 --> 15:42.103
I figure about two hours tomorrow,
we'll be home free.

15:42.241 --> 15:43.708
Come here.

16:00.025 --> 16:01.686
What?

16:06.131 --> 16:08.599
I love you.

16:11.403 --> 16:12.734
I know that.

16:14.106 --> 16:17.667
No, I mean even without the money.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.526
Last call for wagers. No more bets.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.236
Come on, black, come on.
Here we go.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.536
Yes!

18:12.524 --> 18:13.786
No more bets, please.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.698
Yes, we won!

18:49.695 --> 18:52.687
$4,100.
We said we wouldn't go below $5,000.

18:52.831 --> 18:55.095
Do you want any more coffee?

18:55.234 --> 18:57.168
No, thank you.

19:13.752 --> 19:16.448
Tails we quit. Heads we go for it.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.306
Two out of three.

19:39.378 --> 19:41.710
Last call for wagers.

19:42.748 --> 19:44.340
No more bets.

19:44.483 --> 19:48.681
OK. I'm feeling lucky.
I say we put it on red.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.687
All of it. Red.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.757
I feel red. Do you feel red, D?

19:55.394 --> 19:57.794
We can do this, huh?

20:00.132 --> 20:05.399
I'm gonna put it on.
I'm putting it on red.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.501
OK.

20:29.928 --> 20:32.328
- No, it's black.
- What are you doing?

20:32.464 --> 20:34.830
- It's black.
- What are you doing?

20:39.271 --> 20:43.105
No, it's red.
Go with your instinct. Right?

20:43.242 --> 20:46.439
- No more bets.
- Come on, man.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.340
Gotta get it.

20:52.884 --> 20:55.512
OK, come on red, come on red.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.621
Too late, young lady.

21:44.970 --> 21:48.303
Place your bets.
Bank side, player side.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.738
All set? Cards, please.

21:53.845 --> 21:56.109
Turning for the players.

21:56.415 --> 21:59.009
Passes to the right, please.

22:02.954 --> 22:05.320
Player draws nothing.

22:14.766 --> 22:17.200
And set.

22:17.936 --> 22:20.905
Player side, banker side.

22:21.673 --> 22:25.575
- Who's that guy?
- That's John Gage.

22:25.711 --> 22:29.306
He's a damn billionaire.
That's a rich son of a bitch right there.

22:29.448 --> 22:32.076
He's down over
a million dollars already.

22:32.217 --> 22:34.777
You see them little gold things
he's playing with?

22:34.920 --> 22:37.218
$10,000 apiece.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.553
Every time he lays one down,
10,000 big ones.

22:40.692 --> 22:45.356
Look how cool he is. He must get more
pussy than you can shake a stick at.

22:45.497 --> 22:49.092
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
- Player wins.

22:49.234 --> 22:51.725
It's about time.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.532
- Y'all married?
- Yeah.

22:54.673 --> 22:59.133
- Stick around and gamble a little.
- Excuse me! Excuse me.

23:00.545 --> 23:04.709
Would you mind lending me your wife?
Is that your wife?

23:04.850 --> 23:06.249
Excuse me?

23:08.120 --> 23:12.022
- For luck.
- Well, you'd have to ask her.

23:13.792 --> 23:17.421
- May I?
- Go for it.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.792
I don't think it's a good idea.
We should go.

23:19.931 --> 23:22.229
- Just for a moment?
- I'll go.

23:22.367 --> 23:25.666
Go ahead. It might be fun.
What have we got to lose?

23:25.804 --> 23:28.773
- Well?
- Go and see what happens.

23:28.907 --> 23:32.172
- Yeah, go ahead.
- We'll be here, backing you up.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.670
Thank you.

23:34.813 --> 23:37.805
See if you can get
a little of that money from him.

23:37.949 --> 23:41.476
Do you think she'll ever come back?

23:41.620 --> 23:44.088
I'm just bullshittin' you.

23:46.224 --> 23:49.523
Have a seat.
I've been losing all day long.

23:49.661 --> 23:53.791
Then you appeared and I won
my first hand. You brought me luck.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.400
I'd say that's a sign.

23:56.535 --> 23:58.503
Wouldn't you?

24:01.373 --> 24:03.739
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

24:04.309 --> 24:05.936
Candy?

24:09.047 --> 24:11.777
Place your bets.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.680
100,000.

24:15.220 --> 24:19.213
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

24:25.030 --> 24:28.090
- Not like that.
- Sorry.

24:31.736 --> 24:34.899
All bets set? Cards, please.

24:38.243 --> 24:39.904
Turning for the players.

24:40.045 --> 24:41.444
Now, what we want...

24:42.447 --> 24:45.575
What we need... is a nine.

24:52.357 --> 24:53.756
We don't like that.

24:54.860 --> 24:57.852
Player draws nothing.
Cards for the bank, please.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.794
Bank's the winner with a natural eight.
Pay the bank.

25:05.136 --> 25:07.502
I guess I'm not so lucky after all.

25:07.639 --> 25:11.439
- Do you like cards?
- Not especially.

25:12.043 --> 25:15.206
Wish I'd asked you sooner. Dice?

25:16.481 --> 25:18.574
Yeah, I guess.

25:21.453 --> 25:25.116
- Sam.
- Mr G?

25:27.158 --> 25:28.420
One.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.028
Excuse me, Mr G.

25:40.906 --> 25:43.431
- Maybe I should go.
- This shouldn't take too long.

25:43.575 --> 25:46.135
- What?
- This.

25:53.118 --> 25:54.483
Now...

25:55.987 --> 25:57.955
I hope you find this interesting.

25:59.190 --> 26:01.249
Pit. Tadross.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.920
Yes, sir. It's here now.

26:16.141 --> 26:19.702
- Goes for one million dollars.
- It's a bet.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.508
Here you are, Mr G.
One million dollars.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.705
Bet it all.

27:16.334 --> 27:20.134
Coming out. Crap eleven or any seven
this time. It is a come-out roll.

27:20.271 --> 27:22.205
How much goes, now? Get 'em down.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.365
Pick two.

27:31.182 --> 27:32.843
Now just throw a seven.

27:33.685 --> 27:36.950
If you wanna throw an eleven,
that's all right too.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.425
Aren't you forgetting something?

28:05.116 --> 28:06.549
Winner!

28:21.266 --> 28:23.257
Think I oughta quit now?

28:23.802 --> 28:25.463
I think I should.

28:27.305 --> 28:28.567
Credit my account.

28:31.910 --> 28:36.643
Sweetie, that was incredible.
Unbelievable.

28:36.781 --> 28:38.942
Hi. John Gage.

28:39.084 --> 28:41.917
- Hi. David Murphy.
- Hi, David.

28:42.053 --> 28:45.250
Congratulations.
This is my wife Diana. I guess you met.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.587
- Hi. Diana?
- Diana.

28:48.727 --> 28:52.891
Thank you both. Very generous of you,
David. Are you staying at the hotel?

28:53.031 --> 28:56.364
- No. Actually we're just leaving.
- Yes, we're on our way out.

28:56.501 --> 29:00.631
No, don't do that. We gotta celebrate.
Let me arrange a room for you here.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.833
- That's very nice, but...
- No, I insist.

29:03.975 --> 29:06.944
Please. It's the least I can do. OK?

29:07.078 --> 29:10.070
Really, just sign for it.
Anything you want.

29:10.215 --> 29:12.911
There's some lovely shops
off the lobby.

29:13.051 --> 29:14.643
Have you seen 'em?

29:17.188 --> 29:18.678
Let's go.

29:30.268 --> 29:32.293
How about that?

29:35.807 --> 29:37.900
Wow.

29:38.042 --> 29:39.976
D, what do you think?

29:40.912 --> 29:43.142
Godfather?

29:48.019 --> 29:50.385
You won a million dollars today.

29:51.022 --> 29:55.152
- He won it.
- Honey, you won it for him.

30:02.567 --> 30:04.797
This feels nice.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.534
Don't get it. Just stay right here.

30:08.673 --> 30:10.334
OK.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.619
Hello. William Shackleford.

30:21.753 --> 30:24.017
Hi. David Murphy.

30:25.690 --> 30:28.454
For Mrs Murphy. From John Gage.

30:29.894 --> 30:31.691
Well, thank him for us.

30:31.830 --> 30:36.199
I'll do that. Mr Gage is hosting a
gathering tonight in his suite at nine.

30:36.334 --> 30:40.236
If you can find the time in your
schedule, he'd be most pleased.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.608
- Look what you got.
- What?

30:45.677 --> 30:47.304
Gift from Gage.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.570
Really?

30:51.716 --> 30:53.877
Well, open it up.

31:04.963 --> 31:06.624
That's $5,000.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.460
How do you know that?

31:10.602 --> 31:13.093
I saw it in the store downstairs.

31:15.640 --> 31:19.371
- Lucky for him you like black.
- Yeah.

32:53.371 --> 32:57.432
No past, no future. Just check
in to a hotel and start all over again.

32:59.377 --> 33:03.245
I just stick 'em under the sheets...

33:03.381 --> 33:06.748
That's strange, am I right?

33:11.422 --> 33:15.222
- In another life, have a good time.
- Thanks.

33:27.572 --> 33:30.598
Who is that guy Shackleford?

33:30.742 --> 33:33.370
Someone who works for me.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.809
Someone I trust.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.716
He killed someone once.

33:45.356 --> 33:50.293
Tell me, where do you see
yourself in, say, ten years?

33:52.397 --> 33:55.594
Well, I wouldn't mind being
a billionaire like yourself.

33:56.968 --> 33:58.959
Nice shot. I mean beyond money.

33:59.103 --> 34:01.663
What would satisfy you completely,
let you sleep well?

34:02.940 --> 34:05.272
Are you saying you're not satisfied?

34:06.010 --> 34:07.602
Who is?

34:08.446 --> 34:10.641
I am.

34:12.984 --> 34:14.645
She mean it?

34:15.786 --> 34:17.118
I hope so.

34:17.688 --> 34:21.146
Well then, you may not have won
in Vegas, but you're a lucky man.

34:21.292 --> 34:23.317
I got money, I got security,
I have businesses,

34:23.460 --> 34:27.226
but you have something
that I just don't have.

34:27.364 --> 34:30.300
I guess there's limits
to what money can buy.

34:31.268 --> 34:32.531
Not many.

34:33.504 --> 34:36.166
Well, some things aren't for sale.

34:37.641 --> 34:39.166
Such as?

34:40.110 --> 34:42.511
Well, you can't buy people.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.577
That's naive, Diana.
I buy people every day.

34:46.717 --> 34:51.016
In business, maybe, but not
when real emotions are involved.

34:51.155 --> 34:54.556
What are you saying?
You can't buy love? Isn't that a cliché?

34:55.860 --> 34:58.988
- It's absolutely true.
- Is it?

34:59.130 --> 35:01.030
What do you think?

35:01.165 --> 35:03.998
- I agree with Diana.
- You do?

35:05.970 --> 35:08.632
Well, let's test the cliché.

35:11.776 --> 35:17.146
Suppose I were to offer
you one million dollars...

35:20.384 --> 35:24.081
...for one night with your wife?

35:28.192 --> 35:30.353
I'd assume you're kidding.

35:31.062 --> 35:34.725
Let's pretend I'm not.
What would you say?

35:38.169 --> 35:40.364
He'd tell you to go to hell.

35:42.073 --> 35:44.507
I didn't hear him.

35:45.209 --> 35:47.871
I'd tell you to go to hell.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.290
That's a reflex answer
because you view it as hypothetical.

36:03.427 --> 36:07.488
But let's say that
there were real money behind it.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.467
I'm not kidding.

36:10.601 --> 36:16.130
A million dollars. The night would pass,
but the money could last a lifetime.

36:16.874 --> 36:19.104
Think of it.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.541
A million dollars.

36:23.147 --> 36:27.447
A lifetime of security, for one night.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.979
And don't answer right away,
but consider it.

36:34.125 --> 36:35.922
Seriously.

36:37.228 --> 36:39.594
We're positive, OK?

36:43.367 --> 36:45.164
Then you've answered my question.

36:45.303 --> 36:49.467
And you've proved your point.
There are limits to what money can buy.

36:49.607 --> 36:54.271
It's late and I hate to admit it,
but I have a meeting.

36:54.412 --> 36:56.539
May I have one dance?

36:56.681 --> 36:59.479
Of course, with your permission.

36:59.617 --> 37:01.778
I think you'd better
get on to that meeting.

37:01.919 --> 37:04.080
You don't want to miss out
on your next billion.

37:05.723 --> 37:08.521
Understood.
I wouldn't part with her either.

37:11.262 --> 37:12.957
Goodnight.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.984
Can't sleep?

38:14.125 --> 38:15.820
No.

38:17.428 --> 38:19.259
Me neither.

38:25.703 --> 38:28.536
I just keep thinking about it.

38:30.941 --> 38:33.603
It's so weird, isn't it?

38:35.713 --> 38:37.544
Yeah.

38:43.287 --> 38:46.586
David, I think you want me to do it.

38:50.761 --> 38:53.525
What are you talking about?

38:53.664 --> 38:55.757
Don't be ridiculous.

38:57.902 --> 39:00.200
Maybe we should just talk about it.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.898
Well, I don't want you to do it.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.412
- But you'd let me do it.
- No.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.051
Why? Do you wanna do it?

39:21.926 --> 39:23.723
No.

39:26.030 --> 39:30.433
But I would. I'd do it for you.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.628
For me?

39:44.515 --> 39:47.973
I can't believe we're even
talking about this.

39:49.487 --> 39:55.255
Think about what this money could do
for us, what it could do for our future.

39:56.727 --> 39:59.560
You could finish your house.

39:59.697 --> 40:04.828
You could pay your dad back.
Get rid of our debts.

40:06.537 --> 40:09.097
After all, it wouldn't mean anything.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.401
It's just my body.

40:11.542 --> 40:15.137
It's not my mind.
It's not my heart.

40:17.815 --> 40:21.774
You think we could
do something like that?

40:28.259 --> 40:31.558
We both slept with other people
before we were married, right?

40:31.695 --> 40:33.094
Yeah.

40:34.131 --> 40:37.589
So we just have to look at it like that.

40:41.439 --> 40:45.034
I slept with Bubba Aruzio! If I can
do that, I can sleep with anyone.

40:45.176 --> 40:48.543
- You slept with Bubba?
- You knew.

40:48.679 --> 40:51.204
No, I didn't know that. When?

40:52.716 --> 40:55.879
When you were off sleeping
with that slut Olivia Daigle.

40:56.020 --> 41:00.821
- Olivia Deagle. And she wasn't a slut.
- Excuse me. Olivia Beagle.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.425
I do love you.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.255
- She wasn't a slut.
- Yes, she was.

41:04.395 --> 41:07.660
No, she wasn't...

41:07.798 --> 41:10.028
...unfortunately!

41:13.471 --> 41:16.565
Thank God we can laugh about it.

41:16.707 --> 41:18.607
Yeah.

41:18.742 --> 41:22.075
That's easy to say now. After...

41:26.784 --> 41:30.652
We just have to forget
it ever happened.

41:32.923 --> 41:35.983
And never discuss it. Not even once.

41:39.330 --> 41:42.424
Because nothing will have happened.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.168
Nothing that matters, anyway.

41:56.213 --> 41:59.011
We have a brilliant script. Very special.

41:59.149 --> 42:02.482
It's a comeback vehicle for Diana Ross.

42:02.620 --> 42:06.078
And Billy Ray Cyrus.
Kind of "A Star is Born"...

42:06.223 --> 42:08.521
So your first screenplay
sold for half a million.

42:08.659 --> 42:11.560
- Shoulda been two.
- Except our lawyer caved in on us.

42:11.695 --> 42:15.222
- That won't happen again.
- We're gonna get a lawyer that's tough.

42:15.366 --> 42:19.097
Someone that'll step on
his grandmother for us.

42:19.937 --> 42:23.304
Mr Green. A David Murphy
wants to speak to you urgently.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.101
Put him on the speaker.

42:25.242 --> 42:28.006
This is an old college buddy.
It'll only take a second.

42:28.145 --> 42:31.342
- <i>Jeremy?</i>
- Davey, I'm in a meeting. What's up?

42:31.482 --> 42:33.712
<i>Listen, we need you to close a deal.</i>

42:33.851 --> 42:36.342
- What kind of deal?
- <i>A very big deal.</i>

42:36.487 --> 42:38.387
Big deal. Go on.

42:38.522 --> 42:43.619
<i>We're in Vegas at the Hilton. We met</i>
<i>John Gage. You know who he is?</i>

42:43.761 --> 42:49.199
Sure I know who he is. He's
a billionaire. And a major poon hound.

42:49.333 --> 42:50.595
<i>He is?</i>

42:50.734 --> 42:52.031
Go on.

42:52.169 --> 42:55.866
- <i>He offered us a million dollars.</i>
- A million dollars?

42:56.006 --> 42:58.839
For what? Your kidneys?

43:00.010 --> 43:02.945
<i>For one night with Diana.</i>

43:05.649 --> 43:08.914
What do you mean? One night? Like...

43:09.053 --> 43:10.350
<i>Yes.</i>

43:13.524 --> 43:17.016
Could you excuse me for a second?

43:20.898 --> 43:24.129
Let me get this straight.

43:24.268 --> 43:29.365
He offered you a million dollars for a
night with your wife? Your wife Diana?

43:29.506 --> 43:34.409
And you agreed? I don't know
what to say. How could you do that?

43:34.545 --> 43:39.278
How could you negotiate without me?
Never negotiate without your lawyer!

43:39.416 --> 43:43.648
For a woman like Diana, I could have
gotten you at least two million!

43:43.787 --> 43:48.053
Obviously! You don't wanna
get screwed and then screwed!

43:48.192 --> 43:49.955
Stay, please. This is damage control.

43:50.094 --> 43:53.427
- Two seconds. Eat cookies.
- No. We've heard enough.

43:53.564 --> 43:56.931
- You're hired.
- You're our man. We love your style.

43:57.067 --> 44:00.434
Gladys, check the gentlemen's
schedules. Call me next week.

44:00.571 --> 44:02.095
- Great.
- See you then.

44:02.239 --> 44:06.005
- Thanks for coming.
- No. Thank you.

44:06.143 --> 44:08.771
OK, David, before we go any further,

44:08.912 --> 44:13.008
let's get the moral issue out of the way.

44:13.150 --> 44:17.280
- <i>Leave that to us.</i>
- No, I was referring to my fee. I get 5%.

44:18.989 --> 44:21.219
Would you elaborate
on the verification clause?

44:21.992 --> 44:27.555
Verification. That means you pay, even
if the relationship isn't consummated.

44:28.432 --> 44:31.128
You mean if I'm impotent.

44:31.802 --> 44:34.600
It's important for a lawyer
to cover contingencies.

44:35.773 --> 44:38.833
I can live with that.
The "John Garfield clause"?

44:38.976 --> 44:42.070
That's if you die in the act.

44:45.349 --> 44:48.978
I have no problem with that either.
Can I have your pen?

44:56.293 --> 44:59.057
- You're pretty good, you know?
- Thank you.

44:59.196 --> 45:00.720
You should come work for me.

45:12.976 --> 45:14.910
We have a deal.

45:18.949 --> 45:23.352
A million dollars will be deposited
in your casino account in the morning.

45:29.126 --> 45:31.060
So...

45:32.396 --> 45:33.920
So...

45:34.665 --> 45:36.428
So...

45:38.869 --> 45:40.860
You can go.

45:41.004 --> 45:43.632
Gentlemen, I think it's time
for men of good will

45:43.774 --> 45:47.437
to take leave of one another.

46:13.737 --> 46:15.864
It's all right.

46:16.006 --> 46:18.065
I don't bite.

46:20.310 --> 46:21.902
So...

46:23.547 --> 46:25.981
What, should I go undress?

46:30.821 --> 46:34.018
Cheer up. Find a more creative way
to think about this, OK?

46:34.158 --> 46:38.618
Just look at it like an episode of "The
Dating Game" that went a bit awry.

46:38.762 --> 46:41.560
- It's gonna be OK...
- Ladies and gentlemen.

46:41.698 --> 46:45.964
Me wish to welcome you
to our jamboree.

46:46.103 --> 46:50.699
I couldn't believe it. I know
we could have gotten two million.

46:50.841 --> 46:52.206
Here's your Buddha.

46:52.342 --> 46:55.140
Davey, no point getting out
the crying towel.

46:55.279 --> 46:59.045
You've got a million bucks, buddy.
A million bucks!

47:01.952 --> 47:04.978
She's an amazing woman.
She really is.

47:05.122 --> 47:09.024
Couldn't have gotten 500 for
my girlfriend. Not that I'd do that...

47:09.159 --> 47:13.562
But it's OK that you did.
This is a different situation.

47:13.697 --> 47:15.722
And she agreed to it,
you gotta remember that.

47:15.866 --> 47:20.769
And it's not like it's hard duty or
anything. Hell, he's a great-looking guy.

47:20.904 --> 47:23.964
For a million bucks, I'd sleep with him.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.405
Maybe not.

47:27.544 --> 47:29.876
Hey, buddy!

47:41.925 --> 47:43.586
Come on!

47:51.735 --> 47:53.225
Come on!

47:56.673 --> 47:58.903
What have I done?

48:12.890 --> 48:15.415
D, it's me!

48:16.860 --> 48:18.452
D!

48:19.329 --> 48:21.126
D!

48:23.367 --> 48:26.564
Where is she? Where's my wife?

48:32.509 --> 48:34.500
Diana!

48:35.145 --> 48:36.510
Please!

48:36.647 --> 48:38.444
Where did they go?

48:38.582 --> 48:41.551
- Up!
- Up where?

48:42.085 --> 48:44.451
- <i>Helicóptero.</i>
- Helicopter.

49:01.905 --> 49:04.373
D!

49:07.711 --> 49:09.702
D!

49:10.447 --> 49:13.416
D! D!

49:18.522 --> 49:20.717
D!

53:37.280 --> 53:41.717
They sent for me.
They said you were ready.

53:54.998 --> 53:56.488
Come here.

54:19.155 --> 54:21.123
You missed a button.

54:28.698 --> 54:30.859
Thank you.

54:32.402 --> 54:35.235
I wanna show you something.

54:50.720 --> 54:54.417
- What happened?
- Lights went off.

54:57.460 --> 54:59.860
I see that. Why?

55:03.533 --> 55:05.296
Look.

55:10.640 --> 55:13.336
Can you turn those off, too?

55:16.746 --> 55:18.407
I'm working on it.

55:24.154 --> 55:25.678
Who made the decision?

55:29.326 --> 55:32.625
- We both did.
- No.

55:33.930 --> 55:37.366
Do it for your own reasons,
or don't do it.

55:38.568 --> 55:42.368
- You don't know him.
- I know he didn't stop you.

55:42.505 --> 55:44.598
And if you were mine...

55:48.044 --> 55:50.672
...I wouldn't share you with anyone.

55:56.353 --> 55:59.322
You have no right to judge David.

56:01.958 --> 56:04.449
You're the one who has to buy women.

56:04.594 --> 56:07.461
You think I have to buy women?

56:11.601 --> 56:13.501
Why me, then?

56:13.636 --> 56:17.231
I bought you because
you said you couldn't be bought.

56:18.641 --> 56:20.973
I can't be bought.

56:21.111 --> 56:23.443
We're just gonna fuck,
as I understand it.

56:25.415 --> 56:27.246
You might enjoy it.

56:28.752 --> 56:30.583
Don't bet on it.

56:34.257 --> 56:35.622
I think I will.

56:41.097 --> 56:44.555
Heads we do.
Tails we call the whole thing off.

56:44.701 --> 56:47.602
Turn the boat around, go home.
No hard feelings.

56:48.438 --> 56:50.702
What do you say?

56:52.175 --> 56:53.802
It's your party.

56:55.979 --> 57:00.712
It's my lucky dollar, so I can't lose.

57:22.839 --> 57:24.136
Trust me.

57:25.942 --> 57:28.570
Nothing's gonna happen
you don't choose.

59:42.979 --> 59:45.504
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:03.223
<i>I told myself it was over,</i>

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:06.062
<i>like a dream that vanishes</i>
<i>in the morning light,</i>

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:10.502
<i>and in time, enough time,</i>
<i>I would forget.</i>

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:26.579
Yeah.

01:00:28.224 --> 01:00:29.714
All right.

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:37.555
Yeah. A little fixer-upper
south of Wilshire. It's nothing.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.463
Yeah.

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:41.763
Look, I've got people here.

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:44.031
I'll talk to you later.

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:47.267
Sorry. I'm here for you now.

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:50.004
All right. Two acres on Alta Loma...

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:53.707
- Alta Vista.
- That's right. Murphy property.

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:57.882
We've been a little late on
the payments. We want to settle up.

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:01.286
I don't think that's possible.

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:04.291
- What do you mean?
- The mortgage is two months in default

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:08.989
and it appears that the property
is in contract to another party.

01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:13.565
- To another party? Who?
- That's privileged information.

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:16.501
How can that be? We called
specifically for an extension.

01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:19.233
The extension expired two days ago.

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:22.435
If you don't make a payment,
the bank can repossess.

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:26.105
Without prior notice? Can they do that?

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:28.444
They don't have to give us a warning.

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:31.644
But, in fact, an attempt was
made to call you on the 3rd.

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:35.519
A registered letter, return receipt
requested, was attempted on the 4th.

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:39.389
- Apparently there was no one home.
- We were out of town.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:44.796
Well, I am sorry,
but you snooze, you lose.

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:48.697
"You snooze, you lose."

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:50.997
"You snooze, you lose"?

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:55.236
- It's an expression.
- That's beautiful.

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:58.246
That's bullshit!

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:00.906
This is bullshit, man!

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:05.749
Don't deal with these people! They
sold us out. They'll sell you out, too.

01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:53.498
Wanna help me in the garden?

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:57.428
OK.

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:10.211
Our tomatoes are looking good,
don't you think?

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:13.849
David?

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:18.559
What's "Gryphonne"?

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:21.987
Gryphon.

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:25.393
Where did you hear that name?

01:03:26.702 --> 01:03:29.569
You have a box of matches.

01:03:31.507 --> 01:03:36.206
- We said we wouldn't talk about it.
- Yeah, well, now I want to talk about it.

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:40.546
Don't you?

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:43.846
- No.
- D.

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:49.550
I thought I could forget
about this, but I can't.

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:55.824
So I think maybe if we just talk about it,
we can put it behind us.

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:05.439
"Gryphon" is a boat.

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:07.975
He took you to a boat?

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:11.238
- In Nevada?
- We flew to Santa Barbara.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.814
- What kind of boat?
- A big boat.

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:17.750
- And then what?
- And then nothing.

01:04:19.922 --> 01:04:23.187
Where did you get the matches?
Were you going through my bag?

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:25.055
No!

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:29.625
Why? What's in your bag?

01:04:30.499 --> 01:04:33.491
I'm not gonna talk about this.
I'm not gonna do it.

01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:12.299
What?

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:17.999
- Who were you talking to?
- My mother.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.405
And what did Mom have to say?

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.447
Nothing. She wasn't there.

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:29.779
You said you were just talking to her.
How could you be if she wasn't there?

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:34.049
Well, I was trying to talk to her,
but I didn't reach her.

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:36.886
- She wasn't in after ten o'clock?
- No, she's not.

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:41.122
If you don't believe me,
would you like to talk to her yourself?

01:06:43.799 --> 01:06:46.097
What is the matter with you?

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:55.641
- What is that?
- You know what it is.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:02.314
- Where did you get this?
- In your wallet.

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:03.850
I've never seen it.

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:07.717
It was in the secret compartment.
Have you been seeing him?

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:10.348
- No!
- You can't stop thinking about him.

01:07:10.493 --> 01:07:11.983
You won't let me.

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:15.789
- Why did you look in my wallet?
- I don't trust you.

01:07:15.931 --> 01:07:19.458
- You know, I don't trust you either.
- Well, then we're even.

01:07:28.911 --> 01:07:30.708
<i>I had to do something.</i>

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:33.610
<i>I wanted to make something good</i>
<i>out of all we'd done wrong.</i>

01:07:33.749 --> 01:07:37.651
<i>I decided to try and buy</i>
<i>our land back.</i>

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:40.381
OK. Alta Vista.

01:07:40.523 --> 01:07:44.653
I just need to find out the guy's name.
I wanna make him an offer.

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:49.197
- I'll get killed for this, Diana.
- I don't want you to get in trouble.

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:51.925
- 543 Alta Vista.
- There it is.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:54.036
There it is right there. Back up.

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:57.435
Here we go. 543 Alta Vista.

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:02.903
This guy's never gonna sell, Diana.

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:05.639
I just saw this guy on TV!

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:49.252
You bastard! You stole our property.

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:54.319
- I'd like to introduce a friend of mine...
- I'm not your friend.

01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:57.091
- Diana advised me on some property...
- Bullshit!

01:08:57.233 --> 01:09:00.862
- You took it and I want it back.
- I tell you what. Can we have...

01:09:01.002 --> 01:09:04.131
That's OK. No, everything's fine.
Everything's under control.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.443
Excuse me.

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:17.276
I'm taking it off!

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:23.085
- Wait a minute...
- Why? Did you just wanna hurt me?

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:26.353
- No! I think you're wonderful.
- That was our house! How could you?

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:29.622
- I got there first.
- I want you to sell it back to me.

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:32.631
- You can't afford it.
- How's a million dollars?

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:36.465
- The price is two.
- If I had two, the price would be four.

01:09:36.604 --> 01:09:38.732
Listen.
I saw an opportunity and took it.

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:42.970
You had the money and the right
instincts, but you were too late.

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:45.636
- I want you to work for me.
- Go to hell.

01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:48.078
- Listen, I mean it.
- Never.

01:09:48.216 --> 01:09:50.048
Why not?

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:52.746
- Because I hate you.
- No, you don't.

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.583
You wish you hated me.

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:18.474
Hi, D.

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:24.586
You look awful.

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:29.284
- Where have you been?
- I'll tell you about it.

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:32.622
I'm just gonna have some wine first.

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:36.722
Do you want some?

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:02.480
So where have you been?

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:10.989
Last night I stayed up for hours,
trying to figure a way out of this mess.

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:16.266
And today?

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:20.937
And today I saw Gage.

01:11:28.984 --> 01:11:33.011
Thank you for your trust, David.
And for listening.

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:35.590
- Did you fuck him?
- No!

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:39.751
- But you wanted to, right?
- I met him in broad daylight, in public.

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:44.093
- I don't believe you.
- David, he bought our property.

01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:49.296
That's why I went to see him. I just
wanted to find some way to get it back.

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:54.205
You have no reason to be jealous.
I hate him.

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:56.573
- Tell me what happened on that boat.
- Don't do this!

01:11:56.712 --> 01:11:58.646
Tell me what happened!

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:01.375
- Why?
- 'Cause I wanna know.

01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:04.918
All right, I'll tell you.
The man was a fucking stallion.

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:07.921
Is that what you want me to say?
We did it all night.

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:10.890
- Is that the truth?
- You don't want the truth.

01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:15.793
You want me to lie and say he's awful.
So I'll say it, and you won't believe me.

01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:18.456
Just tell me the truth, D.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.161
It was sex, David.
Just sex. Not love, just sex.

01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:25.467
- Was it good sex?
- Don't do this, David.

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:28.542
Can you just tell me that, D?
Why are you hesitating?

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:31.976
Just tell me. Was it good?

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:34.280
Yes.

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:47.253
David.

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:55.403
D, don't tell me it was just sex.
You were attracted to him all along.

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:58.836
That's bullshit.
David, I did it for you.

01:12:58.974 --> 01:13:03.934
Don't tell me you did it for me. You did it
for yourself. You were dying to do it.

01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:07.571
It's a lie. I would never do this
for myself. It was all for you.

01:13:07.716 --> 01:13:11.277
Don't lie to me!
You were attracted to him!

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:14.841
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:20.250
I guess you make a deal with the devil,
and eventually you pay the price.

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:24.223
Thanks. From the man
who closed the deal with the devil,

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:26.919
that's very comforting.

01:14:29.565 --> 01:14:31.556
Green.

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.362
- Hi, Di.
- I'm not here.

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:38.362
Yeah, he's right here.
You wanna speak to him?

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:42.204
- No, I don't wanna talk to him.
- <i>Look, sweetie.</i>

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:45.745
He loves you. You love him.

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:49.248
You gotta try and work this out.
It's pretty simple.

01:14:49.384 --> 01:14:53.878
- <i>This is a deal even I can't screw up.</i>
- Tell him he can keep the money.

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:58.023
I don't want any of it.

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:09.762
Davey? She says she
doesn't want the money.

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:12.773
I don't want the money either.

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:26.682
I'll take it.
I mean, if nobody else wants it.

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:51.906
- Hi.
- Hi, Diana.

01:16:06.028 --> 01:16:10.055
<i>The next few weeks without David</i>
<i>felt like months.</i>

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:13.190
<i>I got very good at staring at walls.</i>

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:17.169
Diana, Diana.

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:18.796
The recession has ended.

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:23.037
There's a fella out there
wants to see $10 million homes.

01:16:23.178 --> 01:16:25.476
There is a god.

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:30.549
Find someone else.

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:36.816
Are you nuts? Do you know what
the commission is on $10 million?

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:39.120
- I can't do it.
- You have to do it.

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:41.456
You're the best one I have.

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:45.499
You're the only one I have.
The others are all on caravan.

01:16:51.206 --> 01:16:53.936
I'm sorry, Mr Langford. I can't.

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:59.013
I would never dream of forcing you
to do anything against your will.

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:02.073
Except this one time.

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:06.815
Now move your ass or you're fired.

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:16.392
If you think this is gonna work,
you underestimate me.

01:17:41.523 --> 01:17:44.151
You are truly beautiful.

01:17:45.527 --> 01:17:47.859
What do you think you're doing?

01:17:49.865 --> 01:17:52.129
Looking for a house.

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:59.502
There's Bel Air, Benedict Canyon,
Pacific Palisades.

01:17:59.641 --> 01:18:02.804
- Where would you like to go first?
- Paris.

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:07.580
1120 Bel Air Road, please.

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:20.892
The ceilings are French Gothic.
Renaissance paintings, as you can see.

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:23.020
Parquet floors throughout.

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:24.962
The bathrooms are Italian marble.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.330
This is the master bath.

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:34.369
Why didn't you return my calls?

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:36.935
Do you like it?

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:39.709
No.

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:54.027
- 30 million minimum.
- You think?

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:56.221
- I know.
- Let's look at it.

01:18:56.364 --> 01:19:00.027
- It's not for sale.
- Everything's for sale.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:33.326
This is your house, isn't it?

01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:36.830
Do you like it?

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:45.578
Well, it's certainly beautiful.

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.643
What do you think it needs?

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.843
Tell me. Honestly.

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:56.380
I think it needs a life.

01:19:57.392 --> 01:20:02.659
I think it needs furniture and
maybe a couple of dogs and flowers.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:04.789
It needs you.

01:20:08.036 --> 01:20:11.437
Just forget it. This just won't work.

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:13.200
Why not?

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:18.009
Because from where we've started
we've got nowhere to go.

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:20.137
You don't know that.

01:20:21.683 --> 01:20:23.708
I've never started this way either.

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:29.386
I need you.

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:34.726
No.

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:37.058
You collect things.

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:41.969
Don't you?

01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:45.239
Sometimes.

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:53.606
Yeah.

01:21:57.646 --> 01:22:03.209
Even if you were extremely rich
and smart can you be president?

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:07.082
- No.
- You couldn't be president? Why not?

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:12.759
<i>I took a second job teaching</i>
<i>citizenship, just to keep myself busy.</i>

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:17.058
Ju, where were you born?

01:22:17.198 --> 01:22:19.564
I was born in Seoul, Korea.

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:25.833
- OK, where was she born?
- She was born in Seoul, Korea.

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:30.275
<i>That drug dealer, he is the president.</i>

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:33.006
<i>In my country he could be both.</i>

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:36.348
Where were you born, Miguel?

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:40.215
- Sorry.
- Welcome back.

01:22:40.355 --> 01:22:44.291
- Where were you born?
- Cuba.

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:48.190
So, how do we say "Cuba"
in America?

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:50.389
Cuba.

01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:54.201
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:57.567
- Isn't this the citizenship class?
- Yes.

01:22:57.706 --> 01:23:00.971
- Can I sit in?
- It's full.

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:13.282
- Cuba.
- Thank you.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:30.835
OK, um...

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:32.735
I have a question for you.

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:36.833
Excuse me. Is there something
you'd like to share with us?

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:40.280
I was just saying
that you're an amazing woman.

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:47.412
And beautiful.

01:23:49.557 --> 01:23:52.082
And talented.

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:54.695
And I am crazy about her.

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:08.340
- You're full of surprises, aren't you?
- I'm trying like hell.

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:11.908
- You should go.
- You want me to go?

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:13.674
No!

01:24:17.652 --> 01:24:22.021
Nice people. They want the Dream.

01:24:22.157 --> 01:24:25.217
Well, they saw it in the flesh tonight.

01:24:27.929 --> 01:24:30.830
You have chalk on your face.

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:35.861
I have something I wanna show you.

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:53.511
I didn't know whether
you like big ones or little ones.

01:24:55.957 --> 01:24:59.449
You're so beautiful. Come here.

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:05.931
I didn't have much time
to do anything else.

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:10.602
But it's a start.

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:25.853
Dance?

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:30.350
I should go.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.927
I remember once when I was young,

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:39.863
and I was coming back from
a movie or something,

01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:42.026
I was on the subway.

01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:47.470
There was a girl sitting across from me.

01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:53.570
She was wearing this dress that
was buttoned clear up right to here.

01:25:57.152 --> 01:26:00.280
She was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen.

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:05.189
And I was shy then.

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:08.557
So when she would look at me,

01:26:08.696 --> 01:26:10.687
I would look away.

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:15.168
Then, afterwards,
when I would look back,

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:17.498
she would look away.

01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:25.173
Then I got to where I was gonna get
off, and got off. The doors closed.

01:26:27.081 --> 01:26:32.644
And as the train was pulling away,
she looked right at me

01:26:32.787 --> 01:26:35.483
and gave me the most incredible smile.

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:42.689
It was awful.
I wanted to tear the doors open.

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:47.767
I went back every night,
same time, for two weeks.

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:53.534
But she never showed up.

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:57.640
That was 30 years ago.

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:03.613
And I don't think there's a day
that goes by that I don't think about her.

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.748
I don't want that to happen again.

01:27:15.129 --> 01:27:16.824
Just one dance?

01:30:48.209 --> 01:30:50.541
You wanted the driver's side...

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:53.709
I want a word with you, Gage.

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:57.750
What you don't know is
we got a secret, me and Diana.

01:30:57.885 --> 01:30:59.284
We're invincible.

01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:04.451
- Diana, I need to talk...
- Tomorrow might be a better time.

01:31:04.592 --> 01:31:06.822
Tomorrow might be better, you think?

01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:08.986
Johnny-baby,
I got a suggestion for you.

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:14.193
You know that emblem you got?
The gryphon? The eagle?

01:31:14.335 --> 01:31:18.396
I don't think it's a good idea.
I got a better idea.

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:23.670
How about the cuckoo? Because...
I'm talking to you for a second.

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:26.974
The cuckoo is interesting.
It doesn't have its own nest,

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:30.880
so it moves into the nest of other birds
and destroys their eggs.

01:31:31.018 --> 01:31:32.542
David, stop.

01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:38.051
You don't love me any more?

01:31:43.264 --> 01:31:46.358
Have I ever told you I love you?

01:31:50.571 --> 01:31:53.096
Have a nice dinner.

01:31:54.909 --> 01:31:56.934
- Help him.
- Here.

01:31:58.446 --> 01:32:00.073
Go inside.

01:32:00.214 --> 01:32:03.012
You got him?

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:07.283
D.

01:34:33.601 --> 01:34:37.093
You've done a lot since USC.

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:41.265
First in your class. AIA award.

01:34:41.409 --> 01:34:44.867
- Prix de Rome.
- Yeah.

01:34:46.313 --> 01:34:49.146
Why would you want this job?

01:34:49.283 --> 01:34:52.343
Well, I wanna work.

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:57.787
Overqualified.

01:34:58.359 --> 01:35:00.850
Fine. Exploit me.

01:35:36.897 --> 01:35:39.593
Great architecture
only comes from your passion,

01:35:39.734 --> 01:35:41.998
and even that won't assure you a job.

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:44.696
Louis Kahn.

01:35:44.839 --> 01:35:49.003
Died in a men's room in Penn Station.
For days, no one claimed the body.

01:35:49.143 --> 01:35:50.940
Look at that. Is that beautiful?

01:35:51.078 --> 01:35:53.273
The money men did not weep,

01:35:53.414 --> 01:35:56.144
because the great ones
are impossible to deal with.

01:35:56.283 --> 01:36:01.380
They're a pain in the ass, because they
know that if they do their jobs properly,

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:03.888
if they just this once get it right,

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:08.552
they can actually lift the human spirit,
take it to a higher place.

01:36:13.968 --> 01:36:16.528
- What is this?
- A brick.

01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:20.370
Good. What else?

01:36:20.508 --> 01:36:22.442
A weapon.

01:36:25.679 --> 01:36:30.048
Louis Kahn said, "Even a brick
wants to be something."

01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:40.917
A brick wants to be something.

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:45.132
It aspires.

01:36:51.405 --> 01:36:56.741
Even a common, ordinary brick
wants to be something more than it is.

01:37:01.949 --> 01:37:05.783
Wants to be something better than it is.

01:37:13.627 --> 01:37:15.754
That is what we must be.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.932
See you on Friday.

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:36.711
A brick wants to be something?
I bet it doesn't want to be a lawyer.

01:37:36.851 --> 01:37:39.285
- What are you doing here?
- I missed you.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:43.083
- I missed you, too.
- Thanks.

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:50.520
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

01:37:50.664 --> 01:37:52.689
I'm getting it together.

01:37:58.138 --> 01:38:00.129
She wants a divorce.

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:05.374
She wants her freedom.

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:10.611
If you don't contest it,
you get everything.

01:38:10.751 --> 01:38:14.187
The land, the money. Everything.

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:17.054
Where is she?

01:38:25.766 --> 01:38:29.099
Hi, everybody. I'm Billy Connolly.
Goodbye, everybody.

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:33.002
You may wonder what you're doing
here, sitting in the blazing sun,

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.769
as the smell of the zoo
wafts past your nostrils.

01:38:36.911 --> 01:38:40.642
The reason you are here
is because you are loaded.

01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:43.375
May I say how brilliant it is
to see so many people

01:38:43.517 --> 01:38:46.714
with an interest in the preservation
of endangered species.

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:50.221
Every year, we have this unique way
of making money for the cause.

01:38:50.357 --> 01:38:53.918
We auction animals.
We bid as high as we possibly can,

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:56.621
and the money goes
to sponsor these lovely beasts.

01:38:56.764 --> 01:39:01.167
Let's start the show with a bang. We've
got a superstar as our first animal.

01:39:01.302 --> 01:39:04.601
Ladies and gentlemen, the hippo.

01:39:04.738 --> 01:39:08.504
The animal itself
is far too big and angry to bring along.

01:39:08.642 --> 01:39:12.237
Look at this guy.
Thousands and thousands of pounds

01:39:12.379 --> 01:39:15.314
of aggressive, hostile cellulite.

01:39:15.449 --> 01:39:18.384
Weighs slightly less
than the average school bus.

01:39:18.519 --> 01:39:21.181
And look at that magnificent beastie.

01:39:21.322 --> 01:39:26.350
To put him in a better light,
to relieve you of some serious money...

01:39:26.493 --> 01:39:28.688
Thank you very much.

01:39:28.829 --> 01:39:31.229
...we have a kissy-kissy picture.

01:39:32.366 --> 01:39:34.493
Isn't that nice?

01:39:37.204 --> 01:39:42.141
Ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't dream
of starting the bid below $10,000.

01:39:42.276 --> 01:39:44.608
- Now, I know it's a lot of money...
- 30.

01:39:44.745 --> 01:39:48.545
$30,000, ladies and gentlemen!

01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:54.346
Call me a sentimental old fool,
do I hear 35?

01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:57.355
- 35.
- $35,000!

01:39:57.491 --> 01:40:00.016
- 40.
- $40,000!

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.390
45,000.

01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:05.896
- 50.
- $50,000.

01:40:06.967 --> 01:40:11.165
I can't believe it. That's extraordinary.
50,000 once,

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:14.570
50,000 twice, ladies and gentlemen...

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:17.404
One million dollars.

01:40:23.384 --> 01:40:24.783
I'm sorry?

01:40:24.918 --> 01:40:27.182
One million dollars.

01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:32.420
Did you say one million dollars, sir?

01:40:32.559 --> 01:40:34.151
Yeah.

01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:37.855
Ladies and gentlemen,
one million dollars.

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:42.997
Would anybody care to top that,
ladies and gentlemen?

01:40:43.137 --> 01:40:44.399
I didn't think so.

01:40:44.538 --> 01:40:47.905
In that case, sir, I believe you're
the proud owner of a hippo.

01:40:48.042 --> 01:40:49.634
Congratulations.

01:41:03.624 --> 01:41:06.252
Hello, Diana.

01:41:06.393 --> 01:41:08.190
The next animal to take the stand
is an ostrich...

01:41:08.328 --> 01:41:10.455
I really wanted you to have that money.

01:41:10.597 --> 01:41:13.065
I really wanted you to have that hippo.

01:41:17.071 --> 01:41:20.302
Maybe you two would like
a moment alone.

01:41:33.987 --> 01:41:35.750
So...

01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:40.488
- How are you...
- I hear you're teaching...

01:41:40.627 --> 01:41:43.425
- Sorry.
- Go ahead.

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:45.930
Yeah. I'm teaching.

01:41:48.302 --> 01:41:53.137
You know, it doesn't pay much, but
at least I get to talk about architecture.

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:56.674
You know how I love
to talk about architecture.

01:41:58.412 --> 01:42:01.848
Don't leave, ladies and gentlemen.
It's just a shower.

01:42:01.982 --> 01:42:05.281
A cheque book
makes an ideal umbrella.

01:42:05.419 --> 01:42:08.547
Do we have a dolphin?
Have we a dolphin and an octopus?

01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:10.748
How about tropical fish?

01:42:10.891 --> 01:42:13.826
I know. You're running home
for more cash.

01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:17.522
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.
You can find the money.

01:42:17.664 --> 01:42:20.132
To hell. I'm gone.

01:42:29.443 --> 01:42:31.741
I have to talk to you
about what happened.

01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:34.507
- Don't.
- No. I have to.

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:37.446
Just hear me out.

01:42:39.686 --> 01:42:42.917
I think the mistake I made in Vegas

01:42:43.056 --> 01:42:47.254
was thinking that I could
forget what we did.

01:42:48.595 --> 01:42:51.723
I thought we were invincible.

01:42:52.833 --> 01:42:58.772
Now I know that the things that people
in love do to each other, they remember.

01:42:58.906 --> 01:43:02.239
And if they stay together,
it's not because they forget,

01:43:02.376 --> 01:43:04.310
it's because they forgive.

01:43:11.285 --> 01:43:13.276
I was just...

01:43:16.223 --> 01:43:19.624
I was just so afraid
that you wanted him.

01:43:20.661 --> 01:43:23.824
No, actually, I was afraid
you were right to want him.

01:43:29.102 --> 01:43:32.538
I thought he was the better man.

01:43:37.611 --> 01:43:42.844
And I know now he's not.
He's just got more money.

01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:17.340
I think we should talk.

01:45:18.245 --> 01:45:20.236
I am very happy.

01:45:21.682 --> 01:45:25.482
Shackleford,
have you ever seen me like this?

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:29.152
Can't say that I have.

01:45:29.289 --> 01:45:33.282
- Diana's the reason.
- Enough for any man.

01:45:33.427 --> 01:45:37.488
She is the best of them. Absolutely.

01:45:38.699 --> 01:45:40.496
You are the best of them.

01:45:42.002 --> 01:45:44.061
"The best of them"?

01:45:44.204 --> 01:45:46.729
You said I'm the best of them?

01:45:46.873 --> 01:45:48.807
You are.

01:45:51.445 --> 01:45:53.174
I don't understand.

01:45:54.815 --> 01:45:57.807
Shackleford,
could you explain it to her?

01:45:57.951 --> 01:45:59.418
What?

01:46:00.787 --> 01:46:03.585
I could do that, sir.

01:46:03.724 --> 01:46:07.285
But I feel Ms Murphy
would rather hear it from you.

01:46:07.427 --> 01:46:10.191
OK. All right.

01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:14.096
She's the best of
the million-dollar club. Obviously.

01:46:17.537 --> 01:46:20.995
- "Million-dollar club"?
- Now you've got it.

01:46:22.909 --> 01:46:24.501
You told me you'd
never done that before.

01:46:24.644 --> 01:46:27.204
How many members
would you say there are?

01:46:28.081 --> 01:46:30.140
- Members?
- Yeah.

01:46:31.651 --> 01:46:34.245
- Worldwide?
- Yeah.

01:46:36.089 --> 01:46:37.647
I think a couple of dozen.

01:46:39.159 --> 01:46:41.753
Remember the one
that wouldn't stop hiccuping?

01:46:41.895 --> 01:46:44.887
- What?
- The waitress from Oklahoma.

01:46:45.031 --> 01:46:48.523
Every time you came near her,
she would convulse in hiccups.

01:46:50.604 --> 01:46:54.563
Yeah. I had forgotten. Quite a night.

01:46:56.643 --> 01:47:02.138
The best thing of it is that
you know if you're sexually compatible

01:47:02.282 --> 01:47:04.546
right from the start.

01:47:15.095 --> 01:47:17.655
Shackleford, would you stop the car?

01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:49.228
Thank you, John.

01:47:53.266 --> 01:47:54.528
Goodbye.

01:47:55.702 --> 01:47:57.829
Goodbye.

01:48:04.344 --> 01:48:06.107
Here.

01:48:10.016 --> 01:48:11.483
For luck.

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.151
- Take care of him.
- Sure.

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:33.503
What was all that about?

01:48:35.375 --> 01:48:37.809
I wanted to end it.

01:48:41.715 --> 01:48:45.276
She never would have looked
at me the way she did at him.

01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:40.464
<i>Seven years ago, David proposed</i>
<i>to me at Paradise Cove.</i>

01:49:41.808 --> 01:49:46.609
<i>I wanted to go there to remember</i>
<i>and start over.</i>

01:50:52.746 --> 01:50:55.909
Have I ever told you I love you?

01:51:05.358 --> 01:51:07.223
No.

01:51:11.197 --> 01:51:13.222
I do.

01:51:18.471 --> 01:51:20.132
Still?

01:51:24.277 --> 01:51:26.142
Always.
