WEBVTT

00:07.073 --> 00:08.341
Where's the bread?

00:08.408 --> 00:11.111
{\an1}Uh, it's in the freezer
where it belongs.

00:11.845 --> 00:15.248
You... So we have to defrost it
every time we make Sam lunch?

00:15.315 --> 00:17.550
No, you just have to raise him
not to be so soft

00:17.617 --> 00:19.786
that he can't eat
an ice-cold sandwich.

00:20.987 --> 00:24.391
{\an5}Why is there packing tape
on my salon shears?

00:20.987 --> 00:24.391
{\an1}HELEN: Oh,

00:24.457 --> 00:26.393
I must have opened
an Amazon package with them.

00:26.459 --> 00:28.628
I got a fresh batch
of underpants.

00:29.429 --> 00:32.232
Helen,
these aren't regular scissors.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.067
They're, like, $100 each.

00:34.134 --> 00:36.069
Oh, well, you shouldn't
leave them out, then.

00:36.136 --> 00:37.470
That's on you.

00:39.172 --> 00:40.540
My mistake.

00:40.607 --> 00:43.042
{\an3}Uh, hey, you know, would you
mind, uh, going upstairs

00:43.109 --> 00:45.278
{\an3}and helping Sam getting
ready for school?

00:45.345 --> 00:47.080
I am on it. Boy, I don't know

00:47.147 --> 00:49.749
how you guys survived
without me.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.285
{\an3}So,

00:52.352 --> 00:54.287
her living here is a lot.

00:54.354 --> 00:55.789
{\an6}I need a little
space. Okay.

00:54.354 --> 00:55.789
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

00:55.855 --> 00:59.092
Yesterday she read me
an article about hard water

00:59.159 --> 01:00.493
while I was in the shower.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.395
And I'm pretty sure
she was on the toilet.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.330
I feel bad.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.366
Archie's been working me so hard
at the alley,

01:06.433 --> 01:08.535
you've been stuck here
with her all day.

01:08.601 --> 01:09.402
Which, of course,

01:09.469 --> 01:11.104
you know
because you've been stuck here

01:11.171 --> 01:12.305
with her all day.

01:13.306 --> 01:14.808
I just wish she had more

01:14.874 --> 01:16.509
of a social life or something.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.244
Just a few hours
away from the house.

01:18.311 --> 01:19.779
A hobby. Book club.

01:19.846 --> 01:21.514
Yeah. Or she could
just drive somewhere

01:21.581 --> 01:23.583
and be there for a while.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.485
{\an5}Somewhere nice.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.485
{\an3}Yeah,

01:25.552 --> 01:27.754
of course. Real nice.
But also far.

01:29.456 --> 01:31.491
♪ ♪

01:41.434 --> 01:43.870
Carl, what are you doing?
This is my lane.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.105
{\an3}Not today. Got you set
up right next door.

01:46.172 --> 01:47.273
But this is my lane.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.643
{\an3}You can't put your favorite
lane in your pocket

01:50.710 --> 01:51.511
{\an3}and take it with
you on tour.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.379
{\an3}You got to be prepared
for anything.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.148
{\an4}Got it.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.148
Now focus up.

01:55.215 --> 01:56.883
I laid a new oil pattern
on this lane.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.284
We're gonna be working on it
all week.

01:58.351 --> 02:00.153
What? Forget all
that stuff, man.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.155
{\an8}These oil patterns
won't make you a star,

02:02.222 --> 02:05.124
{\an8}but those acting classes
I emailed you about will.

02:02.222 --> 02:05.124
{\an4}TOM: Lew,

02:05.191 --> 02:06.860
{\an7}I'm not taking
an online acting class

02:06.926 --> 02:09.395
{\an7}from your friend
who was on <i> Wheel of Fortune.</i>

02:10.729 --> 02:12.765
{\an8}Ain't you
on the clock right now?

02:10.729 --> 02:12.765
{\an6}Yep.

02:14.367 --> 02:15.802
{\an8}Right, right.

02:18.771 --> 02:21.241
{\an9}Look, you had a great
first tournament.

02:21.307 --> 02:24.177
{\an9}All right? But there's
still a lot of work to do.

02:24.244 --> 02:25.678
{\an8}You got to finish
higher than 26th

02:25.745 --> 02:27.514
{\an9}if you want to qualify
for the PBA Championship.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.715
{\an8}Okay, got it.

02:28.781 --> 02:30.316
{\an9}Now, the oil
pattern I laid here

02:30.383 --> 02:31.651
{\an8}is really tough.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.586
{\an8}It's called the
Cheetah pattern.

02:33.653 --> 02:34.888
{\an8}Why is it called
the Cheetah pattern?

02:34.954 --> 02:37.357
{\an9}'Cause the guy who
came up with it,

02:37.423 --> 02:40.159
{\an9}his name is Cheetah...
uh, Cheetah Jones.

02:41.961 --> 02:44.297
{\an7}Arch, if you
don't know something,

02:44.364 --> 02:46.232
{\an7}you don't have to make it up
to impress me.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.268
{\an8}Cool name, though, right?

02:46.299 --> 02:48.268
{\an7}Yeah.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.575
{\an9}Well, why'd you
set her up there?

02:55.642 --> 02:57.877
{\an8}You could've put her
closer to the window.

02:57.944 --> 03:00.847
{\an9}Do you want to be
closer to the window?!

03:02.582 --> 03:05.218
{\an8}Okay. Eleanor and I
were just chatting

03:05.285 --> 03:07.287
{\an8}about this water aerobics class

03:07.353 --> 03:08.621
{\an8}that she's taking.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.621
{\an9}Mm.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.390
{\an8}Look, she loves it,

03:10.456 --> 03:12.225
{\an9}and apparently the chlorine
tightens her knee skin.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.861
{\an8}(refrigerator door opens)

03:12.292 --> 03:14.861
{\an8}I have the shins
of a 50-year-old.

03:15.628 --> 03:19.198
{\an8}If I wanted to watch
a bunch of cadavers tread water,

03:19.265 --> 03:21.534
{\an8}I'd turn on <i> Titanic.</i>

03:21.601 --> 03:23.870
{\an3}No offense!

03:25.038 --> 03:28.775
{\an3}You know, I was just thinking
it-it might be fun for you.

03:28.841 --> 03:30.777
You know, take some
time for yourself?

03:30.843 --> 03:31.911
{\an1}ELEANOR:
She's right.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.680
I mean, Helen, have you ever...

03:33.746 --> 03:36.449
thought about dipping your toe
in the dating pool again?

03:36.516 --> 03:39.385
No. There's more diseases
in that pool

03:39.452 --> 03:40.787
than the one
that this old lady's

03:40.853 --> 03:42.488
been floating around in.

03:44.490 --> 03:47.260
Come on, Helen. There's got
to be someone out there

03:47.327 --> 03:50.930
who's caught your eye.
At church or at the post office?

03:50.997 --> 03:52.799
(gasps softly) What about
that guy at the hardware store

03:52.865 --> 03:54.867
that gives you free screws
and makes dirty jokes about it?

03:54.934 --> 03:56.369
{\an5}Frank?

03:54.934 --> 03:56.369
{\an1}JEN:
Mm-hmm.

03:56.436 --> 03:57.670
The only thing
filthier than his mind

03:57.737 --> 03:59.505
is his fingernails.

04:03.343 --> 04:04.677
But...

04:04.744 --> 04:06.512
Ooh, there's a "but"?

04:06.579 --> 04:08.681
{\an6}Forget it.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.681
Oh.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.583
Come on. Helen, what is it?

04:10.650 --> 04:12.819
{\an3}It's nothing.
It's just there...

04:12.885 --> 04:15.822
there was a guy
who asked me out a while back.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.558
You should go for it. Call him.

04:18.625 --> 04:19.959
{\an1}How nice would it be
for you

04:20.026 --> 04:22.295
to just be out of the
house for one night?

04:22.362 --> 04:23.830
{\an1}Oh! Shoot.

04:23.896 --> 04:26.299
Um, I'm gonna go get
another towel, okay?

04:26.366 --> 04:27.667
Call him.

04:28.901 --> 04:30.703
You don't need a man.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.805
After Milton died,
I got a ferret,

04:32.872 --> 04:34.941
and I'm doing just fine.

04:36.676 --> 04:39.712
My God.
Haven't we been through enough?

04:44.884 --> 04:46.486
This pattern's too fast.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.054
My ball is breaking late.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.323
I'm telling you, you got to
get your release point wh...

04:51.057 --> 04:52.992
Yes.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.293
Yes what, woman?

04:55.061 --> 04:57.864
You asked me out on a date.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.001
That was ten years ago.

05:02.068 --> 05:04.070
Well, I thought about it,

05:04.137 --> 05:06.039
and the answer is yes.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.341
Keep your elbow in, Tommy.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.880
What the hell was that?

05:13.946 --> 05:15.348
You asked my mom out?

05:15.415 --> 05:16.849
No.

05:16.916 --> 05:19.585
I mean, technically, yes.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.622
{\an3}But it was so long ago, I-I
forgot it ever happened.

05:22.689 --> 05:23.990
{\an3}Wait, so how
did it happen?

05:24.057 --> 05:25.825
{\an3}Was it like the
beginning of a rom-com?

05:25.892 --> 05:27.627
{\an3}Did somebody drop something?
Did somebody pick something up?

05:27.694 --> 05:29.062
Wait, did you have
to chase a train?

05:29.128 --> 05:30.763
God, I love a good love story.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.365
It wasn't no love story.

05:32.432 --> 05:33.666
{\an1}Look,

05:33.733 --> 05:35.368
{\an3}she came in here one
night, and I got a vibe,

05:35.435 --> 05:36.769
so I asked her out.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.638
{\an3}But she left without
even giving me an answer.

05:38.705 --> 05:39.939
That's why I never told you.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.509
Okay, fine. Let's just move on.

05:43.576 --> 05:44.677
Focus on the bowling.

05:44.744 --> 05:46.379
Man, listen, if it bothers you,

05:46.446 --> 05:48.381
{\an5}I won't...

05:46.446 --> 05:48.381
No, it's fine. Really.

05:48.448 --> 05:49.749
It's... I'm okay.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.056
You got a vibe from my mom?

05:57.824 --> 06:00.593
A vibe? How do you know
she wasn't just hungry?

06:00.660 --> 06:04.030
Sometimes, when she's hungry,
she gives out mixed signals.

06:04.097 --> 06:07.667
Okay, so it does
bother you. Fine.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.669
So I just tell her
I'm not interested.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.871
{\an1}You can't do that.
Then she'll feel rejected.

06:11.938 --> 06:12.939
All right, then.

06:13.005 --> 06:14.674
I guess I'll give her a call.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.110
{\an1}Well, well, only call her
if you really want to.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.778
Oh, no, I want to.

06:18.845 --> 06:21.414
I mean, that woman's
like a Pontiac Aztek.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.416
They don't make them
like that anymore.

06:25.518 --> 06:28.621
{\an5}But, listen,
if you're not cool with it, I...

06:25.518 --> 06:28.621
No, it's fine.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.490
You're calling her.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.058
You sure you're good?

06:33.059 --> 06:34.494
I'm good.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.995
Gonna bowl now.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.830
Don't get a vibe.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.967
{\an1}Hey.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.935
{\an1}My T-ball coach
boned my mom.

06:43.002 --> 06:44.570
I turned out all right.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.405
No, you didn't.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.479
{\an6}Hey, honey. How
was practice?

06:50.777 --> 06:53.479
{\an1}Not great.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.047
Did you talk to my mom?

06:55.114 --> 06:56.716
{\an3}Yes.

06:56.783 --> 06:59.986
I talked her into
going on a date.

07:00.052 --> 07:01.587
Not in our house.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.523
She's at Walmart right now
buying a dress.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.659
Not in our house. Go, me. Right?

07:06.726 --> 07:08.628
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go, you.

07:08.694 --> 07:11.063
{\an5}Did she tell you who
she's going on the date with?

07:08.694 --> 07:11.063
{\an3}Uh-uh.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.999
{\an5}Archie.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.999
{\an3}What?

07:13.065 --> 07:16.135
Wow. That's cute. Right?

07:16.202 --> 07:17.904
Wait, no, bad? Awkward?

07:17.970 --> 07:19.472
(sighs)
I've had a long day.

07:19.539 --> 07:20.740
Can you just tell me
how we feel?

07:21.741 --> 07:23.676
We feel weird.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.077
We feel confused.

07:25.144 --> 07:26.846
{\an1}We drove home
listening to jazz.

07:26.913 --> 07:29.816
{\an1}We didn't even realize
we were listening to jazz.

07:29.882 --> 07:31.150
{\an3}Honey.

07:31.217 --> 07:34.020
{\an1}She's going on a date
with Archie.

07:34.086 --> 07:36.989
Why couldn't it be the mailman
or that waiter at Red Lobster

07:37.056 --> 07:38.658
that gives her
the free Wet-Naps?

07:38.724 --> 07:40.693
I'm pretty sure
those are free for everybody.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.128
Yeah. For a woman
who tips six percent,

07:42.195 --> 07:44.497
she gets a <i> lot</i> of free Wet-Naps.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.500
{\an1}And the best part
about that guy?

07:47.567 --> 07:49.502
He's not Archie.

07:49.569 --> 07:52.238
{\an3}Look, I know that this
is uncomfortable for you,

07:52.305 --> 07:54.507
but this is the first time
she's put herself out there

07:54.574 --> 07:55.908
since your dad died, isn't it?

07:55.975 --> 07:58.044
It's not about that.
This is about Archie.

07:58.110 --> 08:01.047
He shouldn't be swooping in
and dating my mom.

08:01.113 --> 08:02.582
He should be coaching me.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.184
{\an5}It'll be fine. It is one date.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.184
Oh, for now.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.652
They haven't even gone
on the date.

08:06.719 --> 08:07.920
It's already a distraction.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.255
We couldn't crack
one oil pattern

08:09.322 --> 08:11.057
because he was
all over the place.

08:11.123 --> 08:12.892
{\an5}Tom.

08:11.123 --> 08:12.892
Okay, maybe <i> I</i> was
all over the place.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.061
But the point is,
it's a distraction.

08:15.127 --> 08:17.930
{\an4}What if they date
for a month or-or a year?

08:15.127 --> 08:17.930
{\an3}I...

08:17.997 --> 08:20.066
What if they break up the week
of a big PBA Championship?

08:20.132 --> 08:22.969
I mean, have you even stopped
to think about that?

08:23.035 --> 08:24.537
{\an3}Ugh!

08:24.604 --> 08:26.172
This is not
how I wanted to spend

08:26.239 --> 08:28.007
my "your mom's at Walmart" time.

08:31.277 --> 08:34.179
{\an1}Wow, those new dryer sheets
really worked.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.681
{\an1}I always thought
I was an Ocean Breeze gal.

08:35.748 --> 08:37.049
{\an3}Where do you think
they're going?

08:38.683 --> 08:39.986
Better not be fancy.

08:40.052 --> 08:41.287
If there aren't pictures
of the food on the menu,

08:41.354 --> 08:43.022
she's gonna ask
what they're hiding.

08:43.089 --> 08:46.559
That's what dating's all about,
trying new things.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.027
{\an5}(door opens)

08:46.626 --> 08:48.027
{\an3}HELEN:
Knock, knock.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.528
What do you think?

08:52.098 --> 08:55.067
Be honest. I tell you
when you look terrible.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.704
Wow.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.006
Really?

09:00.072 --> 09:03.609
It's from
the Sofia Vergara collection.

09:03.676 --> 09:06.112
Feel like I can speak Spanish.

09:06.913 --> 09:09.115
{\an5}What do you think, Tommy?

09:06.913 --> 09:09.115
I don't know, Ma.

09:09.181 --> 09:10.650
Aren't you always
the one that says

09:10.716 --> 09:12.852
{\an3}dresses are for princesses
and prostitutes?

09:15.688 --> 09:17.623
You look good, Ma.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.992
Are you sure? I mean, I don't
even know where we're going.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.160
Maybe it's too much.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.695
Does it make me look sweaty?

09:22.762 --> 09:25.131
'Cause I'm feeling really clammy
right now.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.733
{\an1}If this is how you feel,
why are you even doing this?

09:27.800 --> 09:29.335
{\an3}'Cause I don't want
to end up alone.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.038
Tightening my knee skin
in some dirty pool

09:32.104 --> 09:34.140
to impress my ferret.

09:35.374 --> 09:38.945
Mom, if you're nervous,
you could always cancel.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.713
Do you think I should?

09:40.780 --> 09:42.648
You don't have anything
to be nervous about, Helen.

09:42.715 --> 09:45.151
You look amazing.
And besides, clammy is in now.

09:45.217 --> 09:46.719
We call it glowy.

09:46.786 --> 09:48.988
Well, in that case,
I've got a glow line

09:49.055 --> 09:52.358
from the back of my neck
down to my ass crack.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.194
{\an1}You're nervous
because you're excited.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.929
{\an1}If there's
anything we can do

09:56.996 --> 09:58.197
to make you feel
more comfortable,

09:58.264 --> 09:59.932
{\an1}we'll do it.
I'll-I'll help you get ready.

09:59.999 --> 10:02.702
{\an1}(chuckles): We'd even go on
the date with you if we could.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.170
I want that.

10:04.236 --> 10:05.972
What?

10:06.038 --> 10:08.040
A double date.
I like that. I want that.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.275
I'll tell Archie.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.011
Ma...

10:13.846 --> 10:17.249
What did you do?

10:22.254 --> 10:24.256
{\an3}Thanks for agreeing to
watch him last-minute, Lew.

10:24.323 --> 10:25.925
Oh, man, no problem.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.226
(Jen clears throat)

10:27.293 --> 10:29.228
{\an3}Oh!

10:29.295 --> 10:31.998
Look out, Salt-N-Pepa.
There's some new queens

10:32.064 --> 10:33.332
{\an3}in town.

10:33.399 --> 10:35.901
{\an1}"New"? What is he
talking about?

10:35.968 --> 10:37.970
I've lived here 50 years.

10:38.037 --> 10:41.607
{\an5}Helen, it was a compliment.

10:38.037 --> 10:41.607
Oh. Thanks.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.811
Lew, just remember,
9:00 p.m. bedtime.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.246
{\an1}Oh, crap.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.948
{\an1}I-I forgot
I'm supposed to bake brownies

10:49.015 --> 10:51.217
{\an1}for Sam's bake sale tomorrow.
Lew, can you do me a huge favor?

10:51.283 --> 10:53.753
{\an5}There's a box...

10:51.283 --> 10:53.753
{\an3}Shh, shh, shh. You
had me at "brownies."

10:53.819 --> 10:56.389
{\an1}Don't <i> Jerry Maguire</i>
my wife.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.827
(Archie and Helen
speaking indistinctly)

11:10.102 --> 11:11.771
Hey, Arch.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.172
{\an3}What do you say we talk
about the Cheetah pattern?

11:13.239 --> 11:14.407
I-I was thinking about it.
My grip

11:14.473 --> 11:15.408
might be the key
to the whole thing.

11:15.474 --> 11:17.877
{\an5}Can we not talk about bowling?

11:15.474 --> 11:17.877
{\an3}TOM:
Can we...?

11:17.943 --> 11:20.079
{\an3}This is what we do, Ma.
I-I sit with Archie.

11:20.146 --> 11:22.314
We talk about bowling. It's
important, right? I mean...

11:22.381 --> 11:23.916
She's right, Tom.

11:23.983 --> 11:27.186
{\an1}We don't have to talk
about bowling all the time.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.088
Come on, live a little.

11:31.057 --> 11:33.359
{\an1}Yeah, just gambled
my family's future on it,

11:33.426 --> 11:35.995
{\an1}but, yeah, let's see
what they have for appetizers.

11:36.929 --> 11:39.198
{\an5}Can I get you something
to drink?

11:36.929 --> 11:39.198
{\an3}Uh,

11:39.265 --> 11:41.200
{\an1}just a round of waters, I think.
We're not drinking tonight.

11:41.267 --> 11:42.935
{\an6}We're not?

11:41.267 --> 11:42.935
{\an1}Oh, no.

11:43.002 --> 11:45.071
{\an1}Archie and I have an early
morning. Big day of practice.

11:45.137 --> 11:46.338
I'll have a glass of wine.

11:46.405 --> 11:47.840
Make that two.

11:47.907 --> 11:49.341
You never drink wine.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.010
I'm just making
an observation.

11:51.077 --> 11:53.112
{\an1}She never drinks wine.
The table is here.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.082
{\an1}The candle's hot.
You're pinching my leg.

11:58.951 --> 12:01.020
I'll get those waters started.

12:03.022 --> 12:06.125
{\an3}So, what's
everyone ordering?

12:06.192 --> 12:08.894
{\an6}Well, the steak
sounds exquisite.

12:06.192 --> 12:08.894
{\an1}Mmm.

12:08.961 --> 12:10.496
Since when
do you say "exquisite"?

12:10.563 --> 12:12.298
I say it all the time.

12:12.364 --> 12:15.000
As in, "Why don't you mind
your exquisite business?"

12:15.067 --> 12:17.303
{\an5}(Helen and Archie laugh)

12:15.067 --> 12:17.303
(phone vibrating)

12:17.369 --> 12:19.205
{\an1}Sorry.

12:19.271 --> 12:20.973
{\an1}It's Lew.
I'll get it later.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.174
He's watching our kid.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.809
I'll get it now.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.180
{\an5}What's up, man?

12:26.579 --> 12:28.180
LEW:
Hey, Tom.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.382
{\an5}Do you have a hand sifter?

12:28.247 --> 12:30.382
TOM:
What?

12:30.449 --> 12:31.851
I don't know what that is.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.419
I don't know
what I have anymore, Lew.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.021
I don't know what's going on.
I don't know anything!

12:36.088 --> 12:38.023
(line disconnects)

12:38.090 --> 12:40.860
I don't think that was about me.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.964
{\an3}Okay.

12:45.030 --> 12:48.267
{\an3}So, the tiramisu will
have no espresso powder.

12:48.334 --> 12:51.003
Eh, it's not a
big deal, Sam.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.538
This is awesome.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.506
You should be a chef.

12:53.572 --> 12:54.607
Ah. Well, in my house,

12:54.673 --> 12:57.176
we didn't have money
for me to go to culinary school,

12:57.243 --> 12:59.845
so now I just do it for fun.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.047
But maybe someday.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.984
{\an1}So, which one of these
am I taking to the bake sale?

13:05.050 --> 13:07.119
Ah. I was thinking
we could cut up

13:07.186 --> 13:08.988
this coconut,
passion fruit tart,

13:09.054 --> 13:11.223
and you could serve them
as a little amuse-bouche.

13:14.193 --> 13:16.862
I have enough nicknames already.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.232
Well, it's a good thing

13:20.299 --> 13:22.268
we didn't go
with the peanut butter balls.

13:22.334 --> 13:23.936
(clears throat)

13:24.003 --> 13:25.404
So, finally, I said,

13:25.471 --> 13:27.973
{\an1}"Please don't tell me
your life story.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.542
{\an1}Just fill
my damn prescription."

13:29.608 --> 13:31.110
(Helen and Archie laughing)

13:32.011 --> 13:35.080
{\an3}Oh, yeah, they don't make
pharmacists like they used to.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.883
{\an4}I know.
(laughs)

13:35.147 --> 13:37.883
{\an3}(chuckles)

13:37.950 --> 13:40.519
{\an1}(laughs)
I don't think I get it.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.557
{\an3}Well, I guess that
makes it an inside joke.

13:44.623 --> 13:46.425
(Helen and Archie laugh)

13:46.492 --> 13:48.427
{\an3}So, what do you think?
Uh, is this, uh,

13:48.494 --> 13:50.296
heading towards a second date,

13:50.362 --> 13:51.830
{\an3}or you think it's
one and done?

13:51.897 --> 13:53.165
{\an3}They haven't even gotten
their food yet, Tom.

13:53.232 --> 13:54.567
I just want to know
if this is something

13:54.633 --> 13:56.602
{\an5}we have to get used to.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.602
Okay. You know what?

13:56.669 --> 13:59.038
{\an3}We have to go home.
I just remembered

13:59.104 --> 14:01.173
{\an6}we have leftovers
in the fridge.

13:59.104 --> 14:01.173
No, we don't.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.575
Why are you lying?

14:02.641 --> 14:05.911
{\an3}I'm thinking they
might want to be alone.

14:05.978 --> 14:07.046
Why would you think that?

14:07.112 --> 14:08.280
We want to be alone.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.016
{\an1}How do you know
she's not just saying that

14:11.083 --> 14:12.117
to make Archie feel good?

14:12.184 --> 14:13.185
{\an1}She's not.

14:13.252 --> 14:15.921
Okay. It's time to go, Tom.

14:15.988 --> 14:17.456
{\an5}You two have a good night.

14:15.988 --> 14:17.456
{\an3}What?

14:17.523 --> 14:19.058
{\an3}I... Honey,

14:19.124 --> 14:20.359
{\an4}I ordered
the soup of the day.

14:19.124 --> 14:20.359
{\an3}(sighs)

14:20.426 --> 14:22.895
{\an1}If we leave now,
I'll never know what it was.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.499
{\an3}I hate it when people bring
children to a restaurant.

14:27.566 --> 14:30.169
(both laugh)

14:32.004 --> 14:33.872
Can you believe she
asked us to leave?

14:33.939 --> 14:36.475
It was her idea that we come,
and then she asks us to leave?

14:36.542 --> 14:39.111
She was having a good time.
You were making it weird.

14:39.178 --> 14:41.480
Everybody was acting different.
Ordering wine.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.182
Archie was wearing cologne.

14:43.249 --> 14:46.919
I swear my mom smelled him
and went, "Mmm, mmm."

14:48.454 --> 14:50.589
So, Archie smelled good,
and it's been a long time

14:50.656 --> 14:52.958
since your mom
"Mmm, mmm-ed" a guy.

14:53.025 --> 14:55.227
Two of the grumpiest people
I know

14:55.294 --> 14:57.563
{\an5}couldn't stop smiling all night.

14:55.294 --> 14:57.563
{\an1}I know.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.466
It was adorable. I've never seen
that twinkle in your mom's eye.

15:00.532 --> 15:02.935
I have,
and the last time she had it,

15:03.002 --> 15:04.303
it wasn't with Archie.

15:04.370 --> 15:05.504
It was with my dad.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.306
So this is about your dad.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.241
I don't want
to talk about my dad.

15:09.308 --> 15:11.010
{\an1}You never want
to talk about your dad.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.245
The only thing I know
about him is that he loved

15:13.312 --> 15:15.147
to take you fishing, he brought
you to the Grand Canyon once,

15:15.214 --> 15:17.349
and he cried when he met
Dale Earnhardt.

15:18.717 --> 15:20.919
This isn't about my dad--
this is about Archie.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.921
{\an5}How could he do this to me?

15:20.986 --> 15:22.921
Do what? Have a good time?

15:22.988 --> 15:24.990
Archie was my dad's
best friend, right?

15:25.057 --> 15:27.259
Well... wow.

15:27.326 --> 15:29.161
You never told me that.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.563
He was supposed to watch
over us after my dad died.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.265
Not swoop in and start

15:33.332 --> 15:35.267
dating my mom right
after it happened.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.202
Your dad died 20 years ago.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.637
He's a procrastinator.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.007
{\an3}Look...

15:42.074 --> 15:43.509
I get why this bothers you now.

15:43.575 --> 15:45.277
But I really don't think
your mom would have done it

15:45.344 --> 15:47.012
if she thought there was
anything wrong with it.

15:47.079 --> 15:48.547
I know.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.216
And Archie has been
watching over you guys.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.218
You know that.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.487
There is a reason he was
the first person she thought of

15:55.554 --> 15:58.023
when I asked if there was anyone
she had her eye on.

15:58.090 --> 16:01.060
Seems like your dad had
a pretty great best friend.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.428
(sighs)

16:02.494 --> 16:04.229
You're right.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.665
It's just happening fast.

16:06.732 --> 16:09.435
I think it's catching me
off-guard a bit.

16:09.501 --> 16:11.403
I get it.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.005
It's okay.

16:13.772 --> 16:15.708
It was nice to see my mom all...

16:15.774 --> 16:18.544
dolled up like a guest preacher
was in town.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.348
{\an5}Having a good time.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.348
{\an3}It was.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.751
I just hope
your best friend does the same

16:25.818 --> 16:27.619
for me after you die.

16:27.686 --> 16:29.722
(chuckles)
Joke's on you.

16:29.788 --> 16:31.523
{\an1}You're
my best friend.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.625
(chuckles)

16:34.493 --> 16:36.362
See, this is me
waiting for you to say,

16:36.428 --> 16:38.430
"You're <i> my</i> best friend, Tom."

16:40.599 --> 16:42.634
(Archie laughing)

16:43.535 --> 16:45.471
{\an4}HELEN:
Thank you for walking me
to the door.

16:45.537 --> 16:47.206
{\an1}That's very gentlemanly
of you.

16:47.272 --> 16:49.341
{\an4}ARCHIE:
Gentleman is my middle name,
you know?

16:49.408 --> 16:51.310
No, it's not.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.779
Would you...

16:53.846 --> 16:55.614
uh...

16:55.681 --> 16:57.249
like to come in for some coffee?

16:57.316 --> 16:58.684
And that's it?

17:00.319 --> 17:02.054
{\an3}Hey, guys.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.555
No, I think I should go.

17:03.622 --> 17:05.156
{\an3}Come on,
Archie.

17:05.223 --> 17:06.492
Come in the kitchen
and have some coffee.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.292
{\an5}That's all right, Tom, I...

17:06.558 --> 17:08.292
Arch, come on.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.528
Come in the kitchen.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.663
Have some coffee with my mom.

17:11.730 --> 17:12.731
{\an3}(scoffs)

17:12.798 --> 17:14.233
{\an3}He's such
a control freak.

17:14.299 --> 17:16.335
{\an3}I don't know
where he gets it.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.571
(gasps)

17:20.638 --> 17:22.273
Whoa, Tommy.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.710
What is all of this?

17:24.777 --> 17:26.779
Well, I may have ruined
your first date, but...

17:26.845 --> 17:28.781
I wanted to make sure you guys
had a great second date.

17:28.847 --> 17:30.416
{\an1}(chuckles)

17:30.482 --> 17:31.617
This is so fancy.

17:31.683 --> 17:33.185
{\an1}It's like one
of those restaurants

17:33.252 --> 17:35.387
{\an1}where they won't sing
to you on your birthday.

17:38.290 --> 17:39.658
This is a real nice
thing you did, Tom.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.794
Thought about it, Arch.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.529
My mom's gonna date somebody.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.497
I'm really glad it's you.

17:46.598 --> 17:49.067
I'll leave you guys alone.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.203
Where'd all these desserts
come from?

17:51.270 --> 17:52.604
{\an1}TOM:
I have no idea.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.139
{\an3}They were in the fridge
when we got home.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.141
Enjoy.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.277
(stammers)

17:58.343 --> 18:00.112
I'll be right back.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.182
{\an3}Tommy.

18:06.285 --> 18:08.287
Thanks.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.522
Have fun, Ma.

18:20.365 --> 18:22.367
We're not actually gonna
eat any of this, are we?

18:22.434 --> 18:23.702
{\an1}Oh!

18:23.769 --> 18:25.471
God, no! It's 9:30.

18:25.537 --> 18:27.105
I got to get to bed.

18:27.172 --> 18:29.208
Me, too.

18:29.975 --> 18:32.244
I only said yes to the coffee
to be polite.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.446
I just asked you to be polite.

18:34.513 --> 18:36.114
(exhales)

18:34.513 --> 18:36.114
{\an1}(chuckles)

18:36.181 --> 18:37.449
{\an3}All right, Helen,
I'll see you around.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.451
All right, thanks, Arch.

18:39.518 --> 18:41.720
Um, you know...

18:41.787 --> 18:44.656
I've been known
to pick up a bear claw

18:44.723 --> 18:47.559
at, uh, Mr. Donut some mornings.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.562
I could pick up two tomorrow.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.532
If you're asking me out
on another date,

18:53.599 --> 18:56.201
I'm gonna need a few years
to think about it.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.572
Make mine a maple bar.

19:07.579 --> 19:09.481
{\an1}Well, you've finally conquered
the Cheetah pattern.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.550
{\an5}Congratulations.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.550
{\an3}Couldn't have done it
without you.

19:11.617 --> 19:12.918
{\an5}And, hey, Arch.

19:11.617 --> 19:12.918
{\an1}Hmm?

19:12.985 --> 19:15.654
If you hurt my mom,
I'm gonna kill you.

19:17.589 --> 19:18.924
I'm just kidding.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.459
But she'll kill you.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.929
In the woods, bow and arrow.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.430
You'll never hear her coming.

19:27.432 --> 19:28.700
{\an3}Celebrate with
some curly fries?

19:29.668 --> 19:31.637
{\an3}Mm-mm, no,
not today.

19:31.703 --> 19:34.273
{\an3}I made roasted bone
marrow and parsley salad,

19:34.339 --> 19:37.175
{\an3}braised short ribs
with a red wine reduction,

19:37.242 --> 19:39.912
{\an3}and a Concord grape and
honeydew torte for dessert.

19:39.978 --> 19:40.913
It's a tasting menu.

19:40.979 --> 19:44.616
Well, damn, Lew, this
is some fine cuisine.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.551
This is the kind of stuff

19:45.617 --> 19:47.286
we need to be serving here.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.254
{\an3}Set us apart from all
the rest of those dumps.

19:49.321 --> 19:50.455
{\an1}Great.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.624
Mm, oh, how much would it cost

19:52.691 --> 19:54.526
to, uh, put this stuff
on the menu?

19:54.593 --> 19:56.194
About $140 per person.

19:56.261 --> 19:58.397
{\an3}Boy, what in the blue
hell are you thinking?!

19:59.731 --> 20:01.533
{\an1}All right,
let's stick with dump.
