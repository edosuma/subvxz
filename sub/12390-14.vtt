00:22.210 --> 00:25.202

MR. O'GRADY'S FLUSH,

00:32.830 --> 00:34.798
AND MR. DURITZ
WAS SMART TO FOLD,

00:34.830 --> 00:37.060
BECAUSE HE MISSED
HIS STRAIGHT...

00:42.450 --> 00:46.159

00:46.190 --> 00:47.418

01:19.850 --> 01:21.181

01:21.230 --> 01:22.686

01:22.730 --> 01:23.856
NO MORE POKER.
NO MORE GAMBLING.

01:45.870 --> 01:47.007
IS THAT IT?

01:53.620 --> 01:54.928
ALL RIGHT, SON,
LISTEN TO ME.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.260
JUST BECAUSE
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING

01:58.300 --> 01:59.767
DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN
THAT YOU SHOULD DO IT.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.232
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

02:00.240 --> 02:01.969

YOU ARE,

02:26.790 --> 02:28.951
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY
WHO'S BETTER,

02:28.990 --> 02:31.720

IN GAMBLING--

02:31.770 --> 02:33.021
THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.038
EVENTUALLY.

02:35.070 --> 02:37.209
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

02:37.240 --> 02:39.413
DON'T GAMBLE?

TAKE YOUR MONEY.

02:46.330 --> 02:47.592
THAT'S RIGHT,

02:47.630 --> 02:48.961
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
MAKE THE SHOT.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.331
I COULD EASILY
MAKE THE SHOT,

02:50.370 --> 02:51.598
WHICH IS WHY I CAN'T
TAKE YOUR MONEY.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.972
THERE'S NO

CARLTON,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

41:48.170 --> 41:49.102
TO PACK.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.175
WHY?

41:50.210 --> 41:52.576
BECAUSE NOW THEY KNOW
WHERE I LIVE.

41:54.280 --> 41:55.383
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DUDE!

41:55.420 --> 41:56.580
HAPPY BIRTH DAY.

41:57.690 --> 41:58.827
NICE HOUSE...

41:58.860 --> 42:00.623
[***]

42:11.120 --> 42:15.625
[***]

42:18.130 --> 42:22.100
* IN BETWEEN THE LINES
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

42:22.140 --> 42:26.099
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

42:26.150 --> 42:29.119
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG *

42:29.150 --> 42:33.484
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG *

42:33.530 --> 42:39.139
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

42:39.170 --> 42:43.140
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THAT I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

42:43.180 --> 42:46.343
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

42:46.390 --> 42:49.154
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION
LEARN HOW TO BEND *

42:49.190 --> 42:51.158
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

42:51.200 --> 42:53.737
* THEY WILL PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

42:53.770 --> 42:57.171
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

42:57.210 --> 43:00.919
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *
