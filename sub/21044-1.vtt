00:16.809 --> 00:18.853
Are you Chef, Joon Park?

00:18.936 --> 00:20.938
What are you doing here?

00:21.021 --> 00:23.858
If there are any openings,
may I work here?

00:23.941 --> 00:26.902
Cooking isn't everything! You don't know
the first thing about running a business!

00:26.986 --> 00:29.655
[Seo-yeon]
<i>Or the first thing about love...</i>

00:29.738 --> 00:30.573

I'm sorry, Mr. Park,
[panting]

00:32.490 --> 00:33.951

00:37.621 --> 00:38.831
[crying continues]

00:38.914 --> 00:41.584
Park Frozen Gourmet will continue

00:41.667 --> 00:42.668
I'm sorry, Mother.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.419

Mother.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.238
-Oh.
-What are you doing here?

01:12.322 --> 01:13.198
Hello, dear.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.492
Straight home from work again?

01:17.745 --> 01:19.705
You didn't answer my question.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.045
You're not seeing anyone these days?

01:26.127 --> 01:30.007
You should go out and meet a nice girl
for drinks now and then.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.217
Grumpy as usual.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.970
I can't even ask you a simple question.

01:36.429 --> 01:39.516
-Can't a mother ask her son--
-Mother.

01:40.308 --> 01:44.312
-I'm a grown man.
-A grown man should have a family.

01:44.939 --> 01:48.025
Please donâ€™t ambush me
at home like this.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.070

01:54.322 --> 01:55.741
Yeah, yeah, okay.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.077
<i>Claire, are you doing one or two?</i>

01:58.159 --> 01:58.994
Dad!

01:59.078 --> 02:01.454
<i>I'm trying to get
a time guesstimate here, sweetie.</i>

02:01.538 --> 02:03.540
-<i>Make sure you wash your hands!</i>
-Dad!

02:03.791 --> 02:05.416
[Claire] <i>His character in Taste of Love</i>

02:05.500 --> 02:06.919
<i>is totally my favorite.</i>

02:07.002 --> 02:09.630
<i>I mean, I definitely liked him
in Leaves in the Fall.</i>

02:09.713 --> 02:11.297
<i>He was a lot more, like, sensitive?</i>

02:11.381 --> 02:13.174
<i>Oh, and then there was
An Arrow Through My Heart.</i>

02:13.258 --> 02:14.300
<i>He was a lot more manly.</i>

02:14.384 --> 02:16.302
<i>Oh, and then there was a time
he played an alien</i>

02:16.386 --> 02:18.429
-<i>who didn't think he'd ever fall in love.</i>
-I love you.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.057
<i>And then he did.</i>

02:20.140 --> 02:22.267
Each series,
he just got better and better.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.395
But in all those he'd always
kiss the girl by episode nine.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.773
Episode 13 of <i>Taste of Love</i>
comes out tonight

02:27.856 --> 02:29.024
and he still hasn't kissed

02:29.108 --> 02:31.944
his poor, spunky, dishwasher
turned sous-chef!

02:32.695 --> 02:35.405
-Uh... Can I get a turkey and Swiss?
-You've got to understand,

02:35.488 --> 02:38.742
in a Korean drama
that first kiss is everything.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.870
-Lettuce, tomato, mustard...
-It means they're in love!

02:41.954 --> 02:43.956
It's not like American shows
where a kiss means nothing.

02:44.039 --> 02:48.043
In K-drama, when a guy kisses a girl,
that's it!

02:48.127 --> 02:50.211
That's true love forever!

02:50.879 --> 02:52.923
I have no idea what you're talking about.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.300
<i>Taste of Love</i> is the most popular drama
on Korean television.

02:55.383 --> 02:57.970
Nobody freakin' cares!
Just make the sandwich.

-"Will you?"

03:17.697 --> 03:20.283

What kind of business are we in?

03:25.789 --> 03:28.625
I'm just re-watching episode 12
to make sure I didn't miss anything.

03:28.708 --> 03:33.546
What kind of business are we in?

03:36.175 --> 03:39.094
-The customer service--
-The customer service business.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.304
And if we don't serve the customer...

03:42.139 --> 03:44.141
-we're out of business.
-Dad...

03:44.432 --> 03:47.061
If Joon Park kisses Seo-yeon
in this episode

03:47.144 --> 03:48.519
everything will be fine.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.314
-They need to fall in love.
-Give me your phone.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.399
Dad, come on! I'm an adult woman.

03:53.483 --> 03:57.071
Yeah? And I'm the one paying
your adult-woman college tuition.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.822
No more phones at work!

03:58.906 --> 04:01.616
All you do is stare at this thing
all day long!

04:01.950 --> 04:04.369
Why don't you try talking to real people?

04:04.577 --> 04:07.831
Dad, in here life is exciting.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.668
And people are beautiful
and they fall hopelessly, madly in love.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.798
The leading man and the girl
that no one ever looked at before.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.716
They kiss, and there's a happy ending.

04:20.635 --> 04:21.845
[sighs]

04:21.929 --> 04:23.180
Look at the door.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.810
Look at the door for a second.

[cars rumble by]

04:35.400 --> 04:37.236
You know what just happened?

04:37.318 --> 04:41.031
A handsome Korean billionaire
didn't waltz in here

04:41.115 --> 04:42.908
and he didn't sweep you off your feet.

04:43.366 --> 04:47.871
That's real life, Claire.
That stuff doesn't happen.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.580
You know what's real?

04:50.331 --> 04:51.416
I'm real.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.710
Our shop is real.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.921
This life is real!

04:56.004 --> 04:57.338
[squeals softly]

04:57.422 --> 04:59.340

Does it still work?

05:13.563 --> 05:15.190
[clunks]
I've got class.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.945

She's not the one
you're supposed to be with!

06:36.396 --> 06:38.982
She's taking advantage
of your emotional vulnerability!
