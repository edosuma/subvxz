15:51.493 --> 15:54.036
But if it gets serious,
I would like to at least meet him--

15:54.119 --> 15:55.580
[footsteps approaching]

15:55.705 --> 15:57.289

-Claire!

15:57.874 --> 15:59.249
Finally I found you!

16:00.292 --> 16:01.795
We need you.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.880
Dramaworld needs you.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.007
Wait.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.593
Am I in the...?

16:13.598 --> 16:16.350
