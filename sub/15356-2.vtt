01:02.094 --> 01:06.054

01:06.754 --> 01:09.481
The reason I lived with such ferocity...

01:09.482 --> 01:13.548
was for your father who died in my stead,
to take revenge for him.

01:13.634 --> 01:15.114
Take revenge?

01:20.034 --> 01:21.884

02:57.874 --> 03:00.124
This is your passport and ID.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.773
This is really a perfect identity purge.

03:04.774 --> 03:06.413
You're not purging your identity,
you're purging yourself.

03:06.414 --> 03:08.484
Just remember three things.

03:09.294 --> 03:15.233
From now on, you must hide your identity
and live as someone else.

03:16.034 --> 03:20.434
Trust no one and love no one.

03:20.874 --> 03:26.844

Continuing treatment is pointless.

05:12.864 --> 05:14.453

20:14.754 --> 20:15.664
Yes?

20:15.744 --> 20:17.044
I'll be depending on you.

20:17.344 --> 20:18.983
Yes, I understand.

20:18.984 --> 20:20.943
To your seats, back to work!

20:20.944 --> 20:22.774
Quickly! Quickly!

20:23.374 --> 20:25.393
Doctor Lee...
Doctor Lee, your seat is over there.

20:29.374 --> 20:31.564
I'm Go Ki Joon.

20:31.744 --> 20:33.453
Yes. It's nice to meet you.

20:33.454 --> 20:35.763
I've been here about two years before you.

20:35.764 --> 20:40.134
If you do as I say,
life at the Blue House won't be difficult.

20:41.704 --> 20:42.983
Keep them safe.

20:42.984 --> 20:46.673
Don't get the late night orders mixed up
and pick it up from the fountain gate.

20:46.674 --> 20:47.724
Why?

20:48.434 --> 20:51.614
Late night orders don't deliver here.

20:52.344 --> 20:54.294
You're going to have to take this back.

20:54.384 --> 20:56.824
My hiring condition was that
I don't work overtime.

20:57.744 --> 20:59.483
You get to be the only one
not working overtime?

20:59.484 --> 21:02.364
What? You're trying to hand over
late night deliveries?

21:02.384 --> 21:04.063
Keep dreaming, Go Ki Joon.

21:04.064 --> 21:08.553
That's your area of expertise,
so continue doing it!

21:08.554 --> 21:10.523
How dare you tell MIT to do it?

21:10.524 --> 21:13.004
Yes!
I'll continue doing it!

21:27.834 --> 21:28.393
[Security Service Chief - Park Ho Shik]

21:28.444 --> 21:29.523
<i>What?</i>

21:29.524 --> 21:31.644
What do you mean
don't go on the training retreat?

21:32.484 --> 21:33.853
Are you cancelling our hire?

21:33.854 --> 21:35.724
I haven't finished talking.

21:36.184 --> 21:39.393
The president's youngest daughter
Choi Da Hye was held back a year...

21:39.394 --> 21:41.924
and she has quite a unique personality.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.463
Two of our female agents
resigned yesterday.

21:44.464 --> 21:48.483
I came here to guard the president,
not his youngest daughter.

21:48.484 --> 21:49.714
Hey, Rookie.

21:50.484 --> 21:52.254
Are you in charge of human resources?

21:52.664 --> 21:53.873
Do you think you can work wherever you want?

21:53.874 --> 21:55.233
That's not what I meant, but my dream...

21:55.234 --> 21:56.953
Forget talk about dreams!

21:56.954 --> 21:59.904
Protecting the president's family
is just as important as protecting him.

22:01.644 --> 22:05.123
Take Hell Training with next year's rookies

22:05.124 --> 22:08.043
and I'll condense the six month training.

22:08.044 --> 22:09.274
Repeat after me.

22:09.404 --> 22:10.434
One!

22:10.654 --> 22:12.343
See, hear, and don't talk!

22:12.344 --> 22:13.343
One!

22:13.344 --> 22:15.203
See, hear, and don't talk!

22:15.204 --> 22:16.284
Two!

22:16.444 --> 22:17.653
I am a bullet shield!

22:17.654 --> 22:19.604
Two!
I am a bullet...

22:21.234 --> 22:22.804
bullet shield.

22:28.984 --> 22:30.664
<i>Lee Yoon Sung!</i>

22:31.434 --> 22:33.024
<i>Lee Yoon Sung!</i>

22:34.174 --> 22:35.474
Lee Yoon Sung!

22:53.274 --> 22:58.413
I texted you several times for your
account number but you never replied.

22:58.414 --> 23:00.744
I said forget it!
It's gum money.

23:00.904 --> 23:02.253
That's it, right?

23:02.254 --> 23:03.214
Wait...

23:03.374 --> 23:06.817
I don't know if you'll be able to chew
5 million won worth of gum,

23:06.818 --> 23:08.269
but let me repay you.

23:08.324 --> 23:09.574
If you give me your account number,

23:09.575 --> 23:11.673
I can't pay it back all at once,
but I'll repay in installments.

23:11.674 --> 23:12.653
You don't even have the money.

23:12.654 --> 23:13.553
If I pay as I earn it...

23:13.554 --> 23:15.174
You're going to keep doing part-time jobs?

23:15.304 --> 23:17.344
You're not allowed to have side jobs here.

23:17.424 --> 23:21.203
If you just keep that a secret
until I pay you back...

23:21.204 --> 23:24.143
I think you're just using this as an excuse
to start something with me.

23:24.144 --> 23:25.994
But you're not my type.

23:26.134 --> 23:27.704
Should I buy you a mirror too?

23:28.384 --> 23:30.114
I'm speechless...

23:32.414 --> 23:35.184
Pisses me off the more I think about it.

23:36.584 --> 23:39.423
The Security Service
National Communications Network Team,

23:39.424 --> 23:42.883
the nation's greatest brain bank
of masters and doctorates...

23:42.884 --> 23:46.074
Don't look down on us because
we can't do martial arts.

23:48.804 --> 23:49.713
Seriously?

23:49.714 --> 23:51.623
Security Service is Security Service.

23:51.624 --> 23:53.894
I can't stand seeing you
bring down our overall quality.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.863
We won't be doormats any longer.

23:57.864 --> 24:01.144
A dark horse of great physique has arrived.

24:08.394 --> 24:10.744
He must be the dark horse of falling.

24:11.494 --> 24:13.443
Give me your account number!

24:13.444 --> 24:14.463
I said forget it!

24:14.464 --> 24:16.223
No, I'm going to repay you!

24:16.224 --> 24:18.244
Why are you so stubborn?

24:23.924 --> 24:26.163
Because it's the price for saving
my dad's life.

24:26.164 --> 24:28.674
He's the most precious person to me.

24:28.754 --> 24:30.953
He's precious so I don't want it for free.

24:30.954 --> 24:35.334
The more precious something is, the more
you should bear and endure the difficulties.

24:36.774 --> 24:40.214
Hurry up and give me your account number!

24:42.394 --> 24:44.514
You're so stubborn.

24:50.004 --> 24:52.484
I will!
I'll give it to you!

24:55.584 --> 24:56.933
Keep your promise.

24:56.934 --> 24:58.584
Goddamn.

25:41.524 --> 25:42.794
Contract?

25:42.944 --> 25:45.329
You said you'd rather die than not pay me

25:45.330 --> 25:47.043
and you're obviously going to keep working
as a driver,

25:47.044 --> 25:48.654
so just be my driver.

25:49.244 --> 25:53.254
I don't know Korea well and get confused
easily so do little errands for me too.

25:53.284 --> 25:55.293
Driving and errands at 25,000 won each...

25:55.294 --> 25:57.834
A total of 5 million won
so it will be about 200 times, right?

25:58.194 --> 25:59.213
200 times?

25:59.214 --> 26:00.274
You don't want to?

26:00.484 --> 26:02.324
Then forget it.

26:02.794 --> 26:04.173
What's the rush?

26:04.174 --> 26:05.673
Where should I sign?

26:05.674 --> 26:06.893
It won't be easy.

26:06.894 --> 26:09.354
Even if that's the case,
I'm still going to try.

26:09.534 --> 26:10.624
Sign there.

26:16.744 --> 26:17.553
The president?

26:17.554 --> 26:18.744
Now?

26:18.874 --> 26:21.323
Doctor Lee Yoon Sung from MIT.

26:21.324 --> 26:23.974
The dark horse of the National
Communications Network Team.

26:24.714 --> 26:27.423
I heard you were highly scouted in America.

26:27.424 --> 26:29.524
How did you end up in Korea?

26:30.014 --> 26:34.154
My father made more than enough money
and I'll probably inherit it,

26:34.294 --> 26:37.063
so I don't see a reason
to do any favors for America.

26:37.064 --> 26:39.624
You're patriotic.

26:40.164 --> 26:42.214
Nothing compared to you...

26:42.474 --> 26:44.014
Great.

26:46.624 --> 26:50.193
In any case, work hard for the
National Communications Network Team.

26:50.194 --> 26:51.864
I'll do my best.

26:57.074 --> 27:00.694
Newly appointed agents,
Kim Na Na and Shin Eun Ah...

27:01.084 --> 27:02.853
Agent Kim Na Na is 27.

27:02.854 --> 27:04.214
Judo 4th degree black belt...

27:04.314 --> 27:06.083
Agent Shin Eun Ah is 24.

27:06.084 --> 27:07.923
Tae Kwon Do Official 5th degree black belt.

27:07.924 --> 27:12.484
Wow. I said I don't need bodyguards!

27:17.774 --> 27:20.833
Mr. President,
Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan is on the line.

27:20.834 --> 27:22.164
Yes.

27:22.244 --> 27:24.313
She's a bit stubborn
so it will be difficult.

27:24.314 --> 27:26.094
Please take care of her.

27:28.014 --> 27:31.844
Think of yourselves as her sisters and
punish her if she does anything wrong.

27:32.534 --> 27:34.823
I'll work hard, Mr. President.

27:34.824 --> 27:36.333
I'll do my best.

27:36.334 --> 27:37.414
Okay.

27:40.234 --> 27:42.423
She's a bit cranky because
she's repeating a year.

27:42.424 --> 27:43.653
Be understanding.

27:43.654 --> 27:46.833
Don't resign or anything
and take good care of her.

27:46.834 --> 27:47.903
Okay?

27:47.904 --> 27:48.914
Yes.

27:51.384 --> 27:54.024
Doctor Lee Yoon Sung?

27:54.524 --> 27:58.794
If you studied in America,
you must be crazy good at English.

27:59.144 --> 28:02.654
English is my weak point.
Tutor me.

28:02.784 --> 28:03.503
Chief.

28:03.504 --> 28:05.703
You said you wanted to talk to me
about our office task plan, right?

28:05.704 --> 28:09.194
What?
Yes, let's go.

28:10.514 --> 28:11.794
You two...

28:12.034 --> 28:13.324
Do a good job.

28:16.134 --> 28:18.824
What the...?
What kind of man is that?

28:21.104 --> 28:24.404
Unni, you saw that right?
The way he blew me off?

28:24.914 --> 28:26.364
English tutoring?

28:26.644 --> 28:29.763
He's someone who would teach English
with body language.

28:29.764 --> 28:31.033
Body language?

28:31.034 --> 28:32.323
Just keep that in mind.

28:32.324 --> 28:33.953
Let's get along, Da Hye.

28:33.954 --> 28:35.153
You're a student repeating a year...

28:35.154 --> 28:37.153
so it will be Academy to Blue House
to Academy to Blue House.

28:37.154 --> 28:38.624
It should be easy.

28:40.454 --> 28:43.224
It would be a mistake to think that.

28:43.494 --> 28:48.154
Should I work you overtime on the first day
so you can understand your job?

28:57.894 --> 28:59.583
<i>Did you have a good first day?</i>

28:59.584 --> 29:00.614
Yes.

29:00.844 --> 29:04.854
It seems the Blue House's IT
could be one of the best in the world.

29:06.454 --> 29:10.534
First, I'll tell you what I found
about Lee Kyung Wan.

29:10.854 --> 29:14.343
<i>Lee Kyung Wan
is currently an assemblyman.</i>

29:10.244 --> 29:12.724
{\a6}[Restaurant of Love -
Free Meal Community Service]

29:14.434 --> 29:15.551
<i>He cultivated a gentle image</i>

29:15.552 --> 29:17.363
<i>by engaging in a variety
of community service activities.</i>

29:17.364 --> 29:19.874
<i>A large portion of his supporters
are female.</i>

29:20.174 --> 29:22.823
<i>After he became chairman of the
Ministry of Construction and Transportation</i>

29:22.824 --> 29:25.303
<i>and handed government construction
to Haewon Construction,</i>

29:25.304 --> 29:27.974
<i>there have been rumors
that he receives bribes.</i>

29:28.124 --> 29:30.463
<i>From what I found out from his girlfriend,</i>

29:30.464 --> 29:34.514
<i>he's also receiving money
from district governments.</i>

29:35.774 --> 29:39.194
He was already corrupt
back when he abandoned the agents.

29:40.854 --> 29:42.444
Finish him.

29:46.814 --> 29:48.394
<i>Why aren't you responding?</i>

29:48.634 --> 29:50.774
There's one thing I'm curious about.

29:51.374 --> 29:54.294
You said there are five
whom I must destroy.

29:54.624 --> 29:57.434
Why are you only telling me
about Lee Kyung Wan?

29:58.284 --> 30:01.724
Out of the five,
I'm only positive about Lee Kyung Wan.

30:02.244 --> 30:08.184
Now, all that remains...
is for the 5 of us to forget.

30:11.634 --> 30:13.094
<i>Only Lee Kyung Wan?</i>

30:13.314 --> 30:18.004
If we track Lee Kyung Wan,
the other four will naturally be revealed.

30:18.554 --> 30:22.803
So get rid of Lee Kyung Wan first
and force the others to show themselves.

30:22.804 --> 30:25.653
Then why did you send me to the Blue House?

30:25.654 --> 30:27.434
I'll tell you that later.

30:28.684 --> 30:32.287
I'm coming up with a master plan
to destroy all 5 of them,

30:32.288 --> 30:33.988
so you'll just have to trust me.

30:34.084 --> 30:39.304
I want to destroy them in a way
I can live with.

30:41.234 --> 30:45.934
I'll find a way to do it
so that the public will never forgive them.

30:47.494 --> 30:48.544
Really?

30:53.724 --> 30:56.264
You have your own ideas too,
so I'll keep tabs on you from the sidelines.

31:03.834 --> 31:07.753
<i>I tracked the account number for Haewon
Construction and it's your wife's account.</i>

31:07.754 --> 31:11.923
Did you take it
or did Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan take it?

31:11.924 --> 31:15.994
I told you that's the money the assemblyman
borrowed from Haewon Construction.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.633
You saw the receipt and promissory note.

31:18.634 --> 31:20.313
You mean the promissory note and receipt

31:20.314 --> 31:22.934
that was forged hurriedly several days ago,
using last year's date?

31:24.464 --> 31:27.574
That... is something that can be drawn up
at any time, as needed,

31:27.575 --> 31:29.953
between two parties with mutual trust.

31:29.954 --> 31:31.293
Prosecutor Jang.

31:31.294 --> 31:32.698
Conduct a search and seizure
on Haewon Construction.

31:32.699 --> 31:34.903
Also, get arrest warrants
for those 3 people, including Lee Kyung Wan.

31:34.904 --> 31:36.703
All right!
Prosecutor Jang!

31:36.704 --> 31:38.784
Leave the arrest warrants to me.

31:43.454 --> 31:45.064
Who said you can arrest him?

31:45.774 --> 31:48.483
Assemblyman Lee works endlessly
for the government party.

31:48.484 --> 31:49.893
Book him without detention.

31:49.894 --> 31:51.743
Who's scared of being booked
without detention?

31:51.744 --> 31:54.224
Arresting someone for accepting bribes
from a third rate construction company

31:54.225 --> 31:55.902
that does sloppy work... That's my
responsibility as a prosecutor, isn't it?!

31:55.904 --> 31:57.683
I won't allow it!

31:57.684 --> 32:01.124
If you want to arrest him that badly,
then show me the evidence!

32:01.704 --> 32:03.233
Due to the faulty construction,

32:03.234 --> 32:05.333
a support beam fell and killed
a pregnant woman!

32:05.334 --> 32:07.283
And that family is out on the streets!

32:07.284 --> 32:10.174
- How can you just...
- I said find evidence, evidence!

32:12.904 --> 32:13.934
Hey.

32:14.004 --> 32:16.734
If you get hung up on every little thing,
how are you going to be a prosecutor?

32:20.204 --> 32:21.893
<i>Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
from Seoul's District Prosecutor's Office</i>

32:21.894 --> 32:24.593
<i>questioned Lee Kyung Wan overnight,</i>

32:24.594 --> 32:27.943
<i>but the investigation is at a standstill
due to lack of evidence.</i>

32:27.944 --> 32:33.034
<i>I'll make sure to find evidence admissible
in court and bring him to justice.</i>

32:33.134 --> 32:34.953
Oh, he's that guy...

32:34.954 --> 32:36.443
Let's talk.

32:36.444 --> 32:37.713
Someone you know?

32:37.714 --> 32:40.223
No. First time seeing him...
How do you know my name?

32:40.224 --> 32:41.874
This ahjussi, seriously?

32:47.444 --> 32:49.754
That's why he was chasing Mi Hee?

32:51.274 --> 32:52.764
He's got spirit.

33:52.094 --> 33:54.633
You're quite persistent,
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

33:54.634 --> 33:56.654
You even came to my home.

33:58.014 --> 34:03.363
He's my friend, but I'm jealous of Chairman
Kim Jeong Sook for having a son like you.

34:03.364 --> 34:07.813
You ignored all my official summons,
that's why I came here personally.

34:07.814 --> 34:12.914
Legally, I don't have to comply
with such a disrespectful visit.

34:14.364 --> 34:17.134
Do you know?

34:17.464 --> 34:22.514
You're making a huge mistake...
by messing with me.

34:22.714 --> 34:27.333
For the sake of the nation and its people...

34:27.804 --> 34:32.657
And also those ignorant fools who haven't
the slightest idea what democracy really is,

34:32.658 --> 34:35.030
but put all their thought and energy
into trying to seize power even once...

34:35.031 --> 34:40.306
My party will continue to flourish, if only
to block these people and nothing else.

34:40.364 --> 34:43.033
So, why are you stirring up trouble for me?

34:43.034 --> 34:47.322
If the methods are wrong, no matter how good
the intentions are, it's still wrong, right?

34:47.324 --> 34:52.533
The moment I fall,
Korea's democracy will die! Die!

34:52.534 --> 34:55.754
How much money did you get
from Haewon Construction?

34:56.094 --> 34:59.443
I confiscated your account books,
but the dates are all off.

34:59.444 --> 35:01.464
And there are records missing.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.453
Hey, look here.

35:03.454 --> 35:05.953
You're really going too far.

35:05.954 --> 35:08.134
You don't want to become
the Attorney General?

35:08.174 --> 35:09.804
Do you want to lose your badge?

35:10.304 --> 35:14.553
With your personality,
being a prosecutor doesn't suit you.

35:14.554 --> 35:19.653
I've been your father's friend
for forty years!

35:19.654 --> 35:24.983
I'm embarrassed by the fact that
my father is friends with someone like you.

35:24.984 --> 35:29.594
What?
Do you think your father is different?

35:39.784 --> 35:42.024
You!
Who are you?

35:46.354 --> 35:48.774
Guards! Guards!

36:30.914 --> 36:32.194
Dad!

36:32.384 --> 36:37.074
I wanted to be an agent
working for the president like you.

36:38.114 --> 36:39.894
I'll do it someday, right?

36:41.884 --> 36:43.684
I'm going to do great?

36:44.984 --> 36:47.304
I knew you would say that.

36:47.974 --> 36:52.253
Mom, I'll make sure
to put on BB cream and lip balm.

36:52.254 --> 36:53.664
Don't worry!

36:56.374 --> 36:57.704
Goodnight.

37:02.304 --> 37:04.604
Is he not going to call for a driver today?

37:30.294 --> 37:31.594
[East District Welfare Office:
Shim Jae Dong]

37:31.595 --> 37:33.064
Shim Jae Dong?

37:33.494 --> 37:35.314
Sunshine Welfare.

37:43.084 --> 37:44.554
10 million won.

37:47.564 --> 37:49.973
Hi, have you ever been abroad?

37:49.974 --> 37:51.994
Okay, you can answer.

37:52.284 --> 37:56.624
So we'll use present perfect
to talk about our past experiences.

37:56.764 --> 37:59.744
Okay, class.
You're done for the day.

38:06.574 --> 38:07.443
Who are you?

38:07.444 --> 38:09.333
I'm asking for my notes back!

38:09.334 --> 38:11.194
Unni, what's wrong with you?!

38:14.664 --> 38:17.283
I'm sorry.
You were startled, weren't you?

38:17.284 --> 38:19.544
You're too scary to lend anything to!

38:25.494 --> 38:27.524
Must you make it so obvious?

38:27.854 --> 38:31.244
My dad is the president, not me!

38:36.044 --> 38:37.294
Da Hye.

38:38.574 --> 38:41.034
I'm sorry about earlier.

38:41.134 --> 38:43.093
It's because it's my first time
as an agent.

38:43.094 --> 38:47.024
I expected it when my dad became president.

38:47.184 --> 38:49.474
So I don't have many friends left.

38:53.344 --> 38:55.504
Put it on.
It should fit.

39:03.944 --> 39:06.533
I'm going clubbing now.

39:06.534 --> 39:08.883
You can't wear bodyguard clothes.

39:08.884 --> 39:14.694
Don't be obvious
and now let's go work overtime!

39:50.494 --> 39:53.583
It's so noisy.
What is this?

39:53.584 --> 39:55.733
I think the library is better.

39:55.734 --> 39:57.813
It's harder there because you get sleepy.

39:57.814 --> 40:00.454
At least, you don't get sleepy here.

40:01.744 --> 40:04.304
You said you don’t like the president's
daughter because she's embarrassing

40:04.305 --> 40:05.643
but now you're having a good time!

40:07.244 --> 40:09.244
I'm going to the bathroom.

40:09.474 --> 40:12.503
Watch her well.
She seems like the type to try to sneak off.

40:12.504 --> 40:14.034
Okay!

40:23.174 --> 40:26.224
We're going today too, right?

40:26.294 --> 40:27.664
Hotel...

40:27.704 --> 40:31.054
It seems you're not seeing the old man
these days.

40:31.274 --> 40:32.663
Although it makes me happy...

40:32.664 --> 40:34.164
We broke up.

40:34.224 --> 40:37.453
Something must have happened,
he changed all his numbers.

40:37.454 --> 40:39.254
I have to be able to contact him first.

40:39.824 --> 40:42.424
What?
Broke up?

40:45.184 --> 40:49.004
Why?
You told me to end things with my sponsor.

40:49.094 --> 40:53.579
I did but now
that it seems you're not popular with men,

40:54.177 --> 40:56.127
I've lost interest in you.

40:56.164 --> 40:57.314
What?

40:57.564 --> 40:59.094
Let's break up too.

41:02.254 --> 41:03.403
Goodness...

41:03.404 --> 41:06.644
I understand it's the latest trend,
but how do people wear so much makeup?

41:08.724 --> 41:11.834
<i>Are you playing me?
Are you playing games with me?</i>

41:13.514 --> 41:17.394
I asked if you're playing with me?!
Say something, you big jerk!

41:18.564 --> 41:20.914
Why are you only getting here now?
I've been waiting for you.

41:46.964 --> 41:50.064
You're two-timing me?
You, Jerk!

41:55.164 --> 41:58.284
Hey, are you stupid?

41:58.544 --> 42:00.384
Do you really need me to say it?

42:00.454 --> 42:02.073
I'm not into you!

42:02.074 --> 42:03.614
You, Jerk...

42:10.044 --> 42:11.484
Kim Na Na.

42:13.784 --> 42:16.214
Hey... Kim Na Na.

42:18.894 --> 42:20.854
She's completely out of it.

42:25.864 --> 42:27.014
Here.

42:27.634 --> 42:29.314
Thanks for the "designated" kiss.

42:31.274 --> 42:32.623
What's this?

42:33.024 --> 42:36.643
Money.
Count how many zeros there are.

42:36.644 --> 42:39.394
You would have to do
fifty 20,000 won drives.

42:40.824 --> 42:41.984
Bye.

42:53.424 --> 42:54.794
Does it hurt?

42:56.074 --> 42:59.518
I'm surprised it hurts
since you're so thick-skinned.

42:59.519 --> 43:01.597
Use this to get treatment.

43:05.804 --> 43:07.444
Yes, Agent Shin.

43:08.744 --> 43:11.084
What?
Da Hye disappeared?

43:11.904 --> 43:13.814
No, she's not over here.

43:13.834 --> 43:17.533
Okay, keep looking.
I'll look too.

43:17.534 --> 43:20.434
I'll leave first.
I'm working.

43:33.734 --> 43:35.194
Go look over there.

43:40.834 --> 43:42.294

43:44.494 --> 43:46.904
- Oh! You!
- Oh!

43:49.274 --> 43:50.453
Are you...?

43:50.454 --> 43:51.534
Wait.

43:53.054 --> 43:54.749
I'm Prosecutor Kim Young Joo from the
Seoul District Prosecutor's Office,

43:54.750 --> 43:55.503
not a pervert.

43:55.504 --> 43:58.583
Seoul District Prosecutor's Office?
Is that true?

43:58.584 --> 44:01.454
- There are so many fakes these days.
- It's true.

44:01.904 --> 44:03.393
What part time job are you working now?

44:03.394 --> 44:04.993
- Your outfit...
- It's not a part time job.

44:04.994 --> 44:07.553
I can't tell you due to national security.

44:07.554 --> 44:09.024
National security?

44:09.754 --> 44:11.554
Are you a cop?

44:12.744 --> 44:14.283
That's a secret too.

44:14.284 --> 44:17.394
I'm in a rush to find someone too.
I'm sorry.

44:18.144 --> 44:21.403
That woman that you gave a ride to
last time when you flipped me.

44:21.404 --> 44:23.054
Where did you drop her off?

44:23.124 --> 44:25.564
- Da Hye!
- Do you know how to contact her?

44:25.914 --> 44:27.993
- Da Hye!
- Da Hye?

44:27.994 --> 44:30.084
The president's youngest daughter?

44:30.554 --> 44:31.943
How did you...?

44:31.944 --> 44:34.764
I saw her during my chase.
I just saw her go that way.

44:43.454 --> 44:45.024
Do you think we can go now?

44:45.284 --> 44:46.594
Let's go.

44:51.914 --> 44:53.924
Why?
You want to leave already?

44:54.914 --> 44:57.694
What do you mean?
I came out because I had a headache.

44:58.824 --> 45:00.244
Let's go in.

45:10.524 --> 45:12.353
Thanks for your help.

45:12.354 --> 45:16.994
If it wasn't for you, I can't even imagine
what would have happened.

45:17.664 --> 45:21.104
Ah! About how to contact that woman...

45:21.484 --> 45:24.004
That unlucky jerk might know.

45:24.944 --> 45:26.804
Unlucky jerk?

45:29.694 --> 45:31.764
<i>Did you lose her yesterday or not?</i>

45:31.834 --> 45:33.063
We did.

45:33.064 --> 45:35.044
I heard there was a mistake
at the academy too.

45:35.474 --> 45:37.383
How can I trust you?

45:37.384 --> 45:40.434
What did I tell you before?
I said she has a unique personality.

45:40.604 --> 45:42.143
Don't you know what that means?

45:42.144 --> 45:43.403
We'll be careful!

45:43.404 --> 45:45.904
Guard her closely while avoiding trouble.

45:46.454 --> 45:50.004
You might feel bad for her since she's young
and has no freedom, but what can we do?

45:50.154 --> 45:51.904
Her father is the president.

45:52.014 --> 45:53.983
<i>You have a call!</i>

45:53.984 --> 45:55.933
<i>It's a message, I tricked you!</i>

It's cold!

46:22.294 --> 46:25.733
Then should I carry around hot water and
follow you everywhere to make it for you?

46:25.734 --> 46:27.824
This is so far from the office!

46:29.274 --> 46:31.124
Here, stamp it.

46:32.454 --> 46:34.843
You keep the stamp and I keep the notepad.

46:34.844 --> 46:37.503
Stamp it every time I run an errand
or drive.

46:37.504 --> 46:39.324
It's over after 200?

46:40.594 --> 46:42.604
You didn't already stamp some, right?

46:43.324 --> 46:45.473
What if you have the same stamp?

46:45.474 --> 46:47.423
Then you take the notepad too!

46:47.424 --> 46:51.154
I already numbered all the pages, so
you can't rip out the ones that are stamped!

46:51.504 --> 46:53.457
If each stamp is so precious,

46:53.458 --> 46:55.453
why didn't you just take the check
yesterday?

46:55.454 --> 46:58.504
Money must solve everything for you?

46:59.054 --> 47:01.924
Shouldn't you apologize first for the kiss?

47:02.274 --> 47:03.394
Kiss?

47:06.004 --> 47:07.343
Hey, that was a greeting.

47:07.344 --> 47:08.683
I don't think it was enough
to warrant an apology.

47:08.684 --> 47:10.013
You used me!

47:10.014 --> 47:12.344
And I ended up on the floor, thanks to you.

47:12.354 --> 47:14.784
Why are you acting like
it was your first kiss?

47:18.224 --> 47:20.954
You... No way...

47:22.144 --> 47:23.614
Is that it?

47:26.064 --> 47:27.404
Really?

47:28.064 --> 47:29.834
Hurry up and stamp it.

47:37.524 --> 47:39.404
Totally an unlucky jerk...

47:47.964 --> 47:49.421
<i>For a single arm shoulder throw,</i>

47:49.422 --> 47:53.650
you put your elbow under the attacker's arm,

47:53.651 --> 47:55.083
bend your knees,

47:55.084 --> 47:58.874
bend your waist, and lower your stance.
That's how it's done.

47:59.734 --> 48:01.354
I'll do it again.

48:25.244 --> 48:27.764
Hey...
It's practice, go easy.

48:31.234 --> 48:34.673
We're in practice, why do you keep
staring at me? And so sleazily too.

48:34.674 --> 48:37.964
What do you mean sleazily?
That’s ridiculous.

48:38.144 --> 48:40.923
You should be grateful
that I'm even looking at you.

48:40.924 --> 48:44.203
Tell me the truth.
It was your first kiss, right?

48:44.204 --> 48:45.514
What?

48:47.774 --> 48:49.533
You used informal speech?

48:49.534 --> 48:51.673
When we got introduced to the president,
I noticed you're younger.

48:51.674 --> 48:56.344
It's demeaning for the instructor
to teach using formal speech.

49:01.014 --> 49:02.114
Doctor Lee!

49:04.444 --> 49:05.704
Did you flip her?

49:05.864 --> 49:07.333
You saw, right? You saw, right?

49:07.334 --> 49:09.304
The dark horse of our team!

49:11.524 --> 49:13.013
What do you mean?

49:13.014 --> 49:17.054
I think she tripped on my long legs
and fell.

49:18.404 --> 49:21.224
I thought you flipped her.

49:21.744 --> 49:23.423
Stop pretending it hurts and get up.

49:23.424 --> 49:25.434
I'm not pretending!

49:26.374 --> 49:27.904
<i>Doctor Lee!</i>

49:34.354 --> 49:38.404
That woman, where is she?
And her contact info?

49:39.034 --> 49:40.823
How did you know I was here?

49:40.824 --> 49:43.724
I can't tell you
in order to protect my source.

49:43.824 --> 49:45.922
If I kept the numbers
of all my one night stands,

49:46.561 --> 49:48.473
I would run out of memory on my phone.

49:48.474 --> 49:49.243
What?

49:49.244 --> 49:52.014
It's not like I'm going to see her again,
why get her number?

49:52.544 --> 49:57.184
That player...
You're really an unlucky jerk.

49:58.394 --> 50:01.104
Did you like her?

50:02.274 --> 50:04.643
You have unusual taste, Kim Young...

50:04.644 --> 50:06.084
Kim Young Joo.

50:06.814 --> 50:09.774
She's involved with Assemblyman Lee Kyung
Wan, whom I'm currently investigating.

50:10.194 --> 50:11.153
You really don't know?

50:11.154 --> 50:12.354
I don't know.

50:12.534 --> 50:15.794
Nothing else, right?
Then see you...

50:18.324 --> 50:20.964
Where the heck is this woman hiding?

50:23.914 --> 50:25.204
Excuse me!

50:30.184 --> 50:33.024
Where are you going?
Your leg seems hurt.

50:34.034 --> 50:38.124
There isn't an x-ray in the medical room so
they told me to get it scanned elsewhere.

50:39.324 --> 50:41.783
Hold on, please.
I'll get my car.

50:41.784 --> 50:42.864
No, it's...

50:46.444 --> 50:47.504
Get in.

50:49.024 --> 50:50.314
I don't want to.

50:50.524 --> 50:53.983
I'll fix the problems I create.
Get in.

50:53.984 --> 50:55.433
I'll take her there.

50:55.434 --> 50:59.444
I said I made her leg like that.
Hurry up and get in!

51:01.564 --> 51:05.474
I think I should go in this car.

51:26.764 --> 51:29.824
Mi Jin, you'll get in big trouble
if you eat flour again!

51:30.144 --> 51:32.794
When you go to Sunshine Welfare,
only eat the rice!

51:33.514 --> 51:35.004
<i>Sunshine Welfare?</i>

51:35.864 --> 51:38.493
Why did you tell her not to eat flour?

51:38.494 --> 51:42.372
She has a flour allergy but she keeps eating
flour and comes here with rashes.

51:42.564 --> 51:44.689
This time she irritated her airway
and almost had an asthma attack.

51:44.690 --> 51:46.776
It was really dangerous.

51:47.504 --> 51:49.335
They keep doing that
because they're on welfare

51:49.336 --> 51:50.793
and don't have to pay hospital bills.

51:50.794 --> 51:55.174
Welfare?
They're not.

51:55.214 --> 51:57.524
I don't have time, can you hurry up?

51:58.884 --> 52:03.054
They're not on welfare...
The nurse must be mistaken.

52:03.334 --> 52:04.784
Do you know those kids?

52:05.984 --> 52:09.944
There's a basement in my apartment building,
they live there.

52:13.044 --> 52:15.914
Those kids!
Stop for a second!

52:16.214 --> 52:17.194
Why?

52:20.464 --> 52:24.104
She said not to eat flour,
why are you eating it again?

52:26.914 --> 52:28.074
Hey!

52:28.284 --> 52:30.164
Why aren't you moving?
Go after them!

52:30.634 --> 52:31.573
Why should I?

52:31.574 --> 52:32.894
Hurry!

52:37.844 --> 52:40.734
Didn't you hear her tell you
not to eat flour?

52:50.974 --> 52:52.373
- Are you okay?
- Did you get hurt?

52:52.374 --> 52:53.784
Are you okay?

52:54.364 --> 52:55.324
Go.

53:00.574 --> 53:01.363
Are you okay?

53:01.364 --> 53:06.824
My bread! My bread!

53:30.734 --> 53:32.204
What happened?

53:34.084 --> 53:37.433
So obsessed with food
that they didn't see the car...

53:37.434 --> 53:40.014
What are parents teaching their kids
these days?

53:41.984 --> 53:47.583
The reason I asked to see you is there
will be a personnel change in 2 months.

53:47.584 --> 53:49.224
Did you know?

53:50.184 --> 53:53.814
Please help.
You're the only person I trust.

53:54.244 --> 53:55.274
Really?

53:56.604 --> 54:01.784
I thought you had someone else to rely on
besides me.

54:02.044 --> 54:07.183
You sit in a position where you control the
300 billion won from the Child Welfare Fund.

54:07.184 --> 54:09.803
I think you've changed from before.

54:09.804 --> 54:12.664
That's a bit difficult.

54:12.834 --> 54:15.883
There was a civil complaint that funds
for underfed children were too small.

54:15.884 --> 54:19.454
Then try harder, there has to be a way.

54:19.624 --> 54:23.963
It's just a bunch of numbers,
how hard could that be?

54:23.964 --> 54:26.294
You've done it more than once.

54:27.404 --> 54:29.444
I'll trust you then.

54:35.754 --> 54:36.754
Go.

54:38.954 --> 54:40.114
Oh, my...

54:40.474 --> 54:42.464
Thanks, Yoon Sung.

54:57.454 --> 54:59.774
How could it hurt that much?

55:04.784 --> 55:05.743
What are you doing?

55:05.744 --> 55:07.994
I'm really okay.
Put me down!

55:08.364 --> 55:09.543
I'm really, really, okay!

55:09.544 --> 55:12.144
Put me down!

55:14.924 --> 55:17.104
I said I can walk.

55:25.004 --> 55:27.264
Why is it so hot here?

55:30.804 --> 55:34.044
What's this?
Is it graffiti?

55:35.994 --> 55:37.724
My height measurement.

55:37.904 --> 55:40.083
My dad marked my height there

55:40.084 --> 55:44.564
from when I moved here at seven
until I was seventeen.

55:44.854 --> 55:47.234
Every first day of the month,
without fail...

56:02.054 --> 56:04.864
I brought you home,
so you should at least offer me some juice.

56:04.924 --> 56:06.334
No manners...

56:07.304 --> 56:09.014
Did your mother go somewhere?

56:13.274 --> 56:15.864
Forget it.
I'll find something myself.

56:16.804 --> 56:18.494
I'm hungry.

56:19.074 --> 56:20.394
Do you have ramen?

56:20.594 --> 56:23.124
Why are you digging through
someone else's house?

56:24.914 --> 56:26.324
Here it is.

56:27.674 --> 56:29.914
Do you want to eat too?
Should I cook two?

56:32.534 --> 56:33.914
It looks good.

56:46.234 --> 56:48.113
- Hey, don't...
- This kimchi is amazing.

56:48.114 --> 56:51.373
Don't spill it!
You'll ruin the tablecloth.

56:51.374 --> 56:54.293
What do you mean ruin? It's all ragged.
Buy a new one.

56:54.294 --> 56:57.863
This is the only tablecloth of this kind
in the world.

56:57.864 --> 57:01.153
My mom made it to fit this table
that my dad made.

57:01.154 --> 57:03.074
Then tell her to make another one.

57:11.494 --> 57:15.214
Is your hobby collecting red stickers?

57:15.634 --> 57:17.263
You put them everywhere.

57:17.264 --> 57:19.044
Why did you take that off?

57:19.524 --> 57:23.024
Are you really asking
because you don't know?

57:23.224 --> 57:25.354
Do you ask about things you know?

57:26.284 --> 57:29.494
You saw my dad.
He has been in the hospital for ten years.

57:29.694 --> 57:32.544
And my mom passed away in that accident.

57:33.244 --> 57:35.422
The bank stuck those on to say that

57:35.423 --> 57:38.314
they're taking away all the furniture
and electronics.

57:39.274 --> 57:43.444
But now that I have a job,
I can repay the debt.

57:43.514 --> 57:46.294
It will work out.
It will be okay.

57:59.124 --> 58:01.453
<i>Noona! Noona!</i>

58:01.454 --> 58:02.654
Who's that?

58:04.234 --> 58:07.823
My noona is weird!
She can't breathe!

58:07.824 --> 58:09.544
Why?

58:14.684 --> 58:16.653
Give her oxygen and inject epinephrine.

58:16.654 --> 58:17.624
Yes.

58:17.944 --> 58:18.903
Does she have asthma?

58:18.904 --> 58:21.203
I don't know but she's allergic to flour.

58:21.204 --> 58:23.313
She ate flour today.

58:23.314 --> 58:25.673
I think she's in anaphylactic shock
due to the flour.

58:25.674 --> 58:29.444
Blood pressure is 70/40.
Heart rate is only 41 beats per minute.

58:29.454 --> 58:31.363
Her oxygen saturation
is only 70 percent too.

58:31.364 --> 58:37.254
Noona! Noona! Mi Jin noona!

58:37.814 --> 58:39.593
Please take care of her, Doctor.

58:39.594 --> 58:42.174
Don't worry for now and go wait outside.

58:56.894 --> 58:59.334
Ah, what the heck?

59:01.164 --> 59:04.214
Kim Na Na.
Can I leave first?

59:04.564 --> 59:06.723
Why am I being punished?
I don't even know them.

59:06.724 --> 59:10.384
If my leg was fine,
I wouldn't have asked you to come here.

59:11.854 --> 59:13.834
Seriously...

59:29.824 --> 59:31.154
Mi Jin.

59:31.764 --> 59:33.173
If your dad is running late,

59:33.174 --> 59:37.293
you should clean a little
and make food and eat with your brother!

59:37.464 --> 59:38.700
You know you get sick when you eat flour

59:38.701 --> 59:40.159
and you keep eating bread!
[Dad]

59:40.734 --> 59:42.574
What do you know?

59:42.704 --> 59:46.644
The water and gas were shut off
a long time ago.

59:46.844 --> 59:50.493
What?
And Ahjussi?

59:50.494 --> 59:53.454
It's already been more than ten months
since he left.

59:54.154 --> 59:56.594
Then you two...

59:58.374 --> 01:00:00.124
This drives me crazy.

01:00:00.674 --> 01:00:03.893
Then you should go eat at the
welfare center, why did you eat bread?

01:00:03.894 --> 01:00:09.454
If we get coupons to eat at the
welfare center, other kids call us beggars!

01:00:10.034 --> 01:00:15.954
We'd rather go hungry or eat bread and ramen
than be called beggars.

01:00:17.394 --> 01:00:21.504
Being itchy is better than being hungry!

01:00:22.464 --> 01:00:25.384
It's better than being called a beggar!

01:00:46.344 --> 01:00:50.545
Sleep...
A sick child shouldn't cry.

01:01:03.973 --> 01:01:07.773
What did I do to deserve this bad luck?

01:01:07.774 --> 01:01:10.733
If my leg was fine,
I wouldn't have brought you.

01:01:10.734 --> 01:01:12.593
Stop grumbling, please.

01:01:12.594 --> 01:01:15.534
There aren't even pretty girls here.
I hate this kind of place.

01:01:15.894 --> 01:01:18.964
You're really using your injury
to get the most out of me, aren't you?

01:01:19.194 --> 01:01:21.444
Don't I get any stamps?

01:01:27.154 --> 01:01:33.154
The community center knew that the children
didn't apply and added them to the meal list

01:01:33.184 --> 01:01:35.504
but the children are starving right now.

01:01:36.044 --> 01:01:38.924
The staff member who handles this
isn't here right now.

01:01:39.164 --> 01:01:40.514
One moment.

01:01:44.614 --> 01:01:46.184
What are the children's names?

01:01:46.504 --> 01:01:49.544
Song Mi Jin and Song Do Jin
living in Hongji-dong.

01:01:51.214 --> 01:01:54.384
It says they already received
their meal coupons.

01:01:55.874 --> 01:01:57.884
at Sunshine Welfare.

01:01:59.354 --> 01:02:00.483
Sunshine Welfare?

01:02:00.484 --> 01:02:02.673
The children already received it,
so it's marked here.

01:02:02.674 --> 01:02:08.194
See. It says monthly payments of 120,000 won
are being deposited to this account.

01:02:08.454 --> 01:02:10.114
Shin Jae Dong.

01:02:11.314 --> 01:02:12.623
These kids...

01:02:12.624 --> 01:02:16.764
According to our records, their meal coupons
were paid, but she says they're starving.

01:02:18.664 --> 01:02:20.754
That's not possible.

01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:23.270
Most likely they spent the money
on other things

01:02:23.271 --> 01:02:25.403
and now they're saying they're starving.

01:02:25.414 --> 01:02:28.754
They said they didn't come get it, because
they didn't want to be treated like beggars.

01:02:28.764 --> 01:02:31.803
Do you know how much kids lie these days?

01:02:31.804 --> 01:02:33.313
Don't be fooled.

01:02:33.314 --> 01:02:38.904
There are lots of kids who lie
and sell their coupons to go to PC rooms.

01:02:39.614 --> 01:02:41.084
Hey, you!

01:02:42.584 --> 01:02:45.243
If it were you, would you eat or starve
and play games?

01:02:45.244 --> 01:02:48.654
What? "You"?
Who are you?

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:50.833
Who are you to call me "you"?

01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:54.304
Me?
I don't like kids starving.

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:59.454
Citizens are paying lots of taxes, so
I want to know why kids are still starving.

01:03:00.244 --> 01:03:04.103
Then what?
Are you saying I took that money?

01:03:04.104 --> 01:03:05.674
How would I know?

01:03:06.134 --> 01:03:08.154
Who do you think is lying?

01:03:09.054 --> 01:03:10.543
It's very strange.

01:03:10.544 --> 01:03:12.674
Hey, you!

01:03:13.094 --> 01:03:16.814
Anyway, please check again and fix it.

01:03:36.804 --> 01:03:39.024
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:16.093
<i>If he betrays me, he'll have to abandon all
his political dreams. So he can't betray me.</i>

01:04:16.094 --> 01:04:17.733
<i>You need to keep an eye on Lee Kyung Wan.</i>

01:04:17.734 --> 01:04:18.434
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:04:18.435 --> 01:04:22.273
<i>I'm a jobless guy in the neighborhood
who hates people who make poor kids starve.</i>

01:04:22.274 --> 01:04:24.573
What the hell is he trying to do?

01:04:24.574 --> 01:04:27.793
<i>It's so reassuring that there are people
like you, Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.</i>

01:04:27.794 --> 01:04:30.093
You can trick someone else's heart.

01:04:30.094 --> 01:04:34.183
I don't understand how you just talk
to any guy!

01:04:34.184 --> 01:04:35.703
<i>Stay out of the plan.</i>

01:04:35.704 --> 01:04:38.543
<i>I'll handle punishments personally.</i>
