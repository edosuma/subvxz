00:20.080 --> 00:22.040
Dad?

00:22.090 --> 00:23.960
Dad.

00:25.880 --> 00:28.360
Dad.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.900
Can I sleep with you?

00:31.901 --> 00:34.769
What's wrong?

00:34.770 --> 00:37.220
Monsters.

00:38.874 --> 00:40.660
All right.

00:53.282 --> 00:56.409
You know what I used to do
when I was scared of monsters?

00:56.410 --> 00:57.959
What?

00:57.960 --> 00:59.890
I used to give them names.

00:59.895 --> 01:01.039
Really?

01:01.040 --> 01:02.739
I used to make friends with them

01:02.740 --> 01:05.336
and talk to them and all
that kind of stuff.

01:07.537 --> 01:08.930
Why don't you try that?

01:08.938 --> 01:10.465
Okay.

01:10.466 --> 01:12.919
But don't give them, like...

01:12.920 --> 01:15.710
don't give them scary names,
give them funny names.

01:15.711 --> 01:17.014
Like what?

01:17.980 --> 01:20.419
Well, I used to have one that
used to live under my bed.

01:20.420 --> 01:21.559
I used to call him Gus.

01:21.560 --> 01:24.680
- That's funny.
- Mm-hmm.

01:24.687 --> 01:26.250
See, and if it's funny,

01:26.256 --> 01:28.890
then you're not gonna be so
scared of them, you know?

01:28.891 --> 01:30.259
Yeah.

01:30.260 --> 01:33.079
Okay.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.110
All right.

01:34.115 --> 01:36.760
You get some sleep, eh?

01:36.766 --> 01:39.360
Hmm?

01:44.380 --> 01:46.239
You gonna stay under there
all night, are you?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.240
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:48.244 --> 01:50.890
- Night-night.
- Good night.

01:55.970 --> 01:57.859
What's that?

01:57.860 --> 01:59.219
You never had basmati?

01:59.220 --> 02:00.779
- No.
- That's Indian rice.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.499
It's, uh, it's really long grain.

02:02.500 --> 02:03.719
You got to try it.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.160
Where do you get that from?

02:05.161 --> 02:07.559
Oh, just at the n... Fuck!

02:07.560 --> 02:10.439
- Jesus.
- Kill the fucking thing, will ya?

02:10.440 --> 02:13.300
- Fucking relax, mate. Jeez.
- Kill it!

02:13.303 --> 02:14.779
I don't come cheap, mate, so, uh...

02:14.780 --> 02:16.399
Yo... You fucking smart-ass.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.610
I'll give you 50 bucks.

02:17.616 --> 02:19.659
- Just kill it.
- They're harmless.

02:19.660 --> 02:21.939
Mate, I just had a double
heart attack here, okay?

02:21.940 --> 02:24.038
So I don't really think you can
say that they're harmless.

02:24.039 --> 02:25.206
They can't hurt you.

02:25.207 --> 02:27.459
Well, it's hurting me right
now, psychologically.

02:27.460 --> 02:28.710
I nearly had a bloody heart attack.

02:28.711 --> 02:30.295
You know what you need to do?

02:30.296 --> 02:31.922
- You need to kill it.
- No.

02:31.923 --> 02:34.059
What you need to do...

02:34.060 --> 02:36.579
- is face your fears.
- Oh, yeah, fuck that shit.

02:36.580 --> 02:38.639
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

02:38.640 --> 02:40.299
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:40.300 --> 02:41.309
What are you doing? What are you doing?

02:41.310 --> 02:43.141
- Come here.
- Ray, Ray, no! Hey! Ray!

02:43.142 --> 02:45.099
I'm not... No! Hey! I'm not... Don't!

02:45.100 --> 02:46.644
I'm not messing around, dude.

02:46.645 --> 02:48.859
Dude, when have you ever heard

02:48.860 --> 02:50.799
of a huntsman ever
fucking hurting anybody?

02:50.800 --> 02:53.139
Yeah, I don't... Well,
I'm sure they hurt people.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.579
Probably kill people, too.

02:54.580 --> 02:56.099
- Oh, they kill people, do they?
- Yeah.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.199
Oh, okay.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.599
Yeah. Well, you imagine some old lady,

02:59.600 --> 03:01.701
she's at home, right? She looks up,

03:01.702 --> 03:03.880
there's a massive huntsman, right?

03:03.886 --> 03:06.409
She has a heart attack. She dies.

03:06.410 --> 03:08.379
A week later, they find her.

03:08.380 --> 03:10.359
The fucking huntsman's gone.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.463
The paramedics come in. They say,

03:12.464 --> 03:14.899
"Oh, heart attack. Natural causes."

03:14.900 --> 03:16.719
But it wasn't natural causes, was it?

03:16.720 --> 03:19.637
It was a dirty, great
hairy fucking huntsman.

03:19.638 --> 03:21.579
Yeah, y-you think it's funny.

03:21.580 --> 03:23.589
They're probably responsible

03:23.590 --> 03:25.999
for killing more old
people in this country,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.359
and we don't even know about it.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.773
- Freddy, Kim is here to see you.
- Okay.

03:30.774 --> 03:34.040
- Thanks, love. I'll be right out.
- Okay.

03:37.553 --> 03:39.349
Just kill it, will you?

03:39.350 --> 03:41.239
I don't kill bugs, mate.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.451
Oh, you don't kill bugs,
you just kill people?

03:43.452 --> 03:45.999
I got to draw the line somewhere.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.490
Uh, you all right?

03:47.498 --> 03:50.030
No, I'm not all right.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.500
Shield me from it or
something, will you?

03:54.505 --> 03:56.679
- Don't let it fucking jump.
- Okay. Okay.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.419
Oh, look at the size of it.

03:58.420 --> 04:00.549
- Come on.
- That thing'd eat ya.

04:00.550 --> 04:02.739
Don't! You mongrel bastard.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.919
So, uh, why don't you tell
Ray your story, mate?

04:09.920 --> 04:12.679
Okay, uh...

04:12.680 --> 04:16.279
my daughter, uh, Jenny...

04:16.279 --> 04:18.319
she went missing in '95.

04:18.320 --> 04:24.859
And, uh... we never, um... The cops...

04:24.860 --> 04:27.429
We nev-we never found out
what happened to her.

04:27.430 --> 04:29.320
Uh, so, um...

04:30.420 --> 04:34.619
The cops, uh, were looking
at this one guy, uh,

04:34.620 --> 04:36.359
- as a suspect.
- Mm.

04:36.360 --> 04:40.479
And one of the cops that I was...
had most of the dealings with...

04:40.480 --> 04:45.599
um, he was convinced that this guy, um,

04:45.600 --> 04:48.920
a guy called Dennis Miller...

04:48.934 --> 04:51.019
... uh, he was convinced

04:51.020 --> 04:53.259
that he knew something, you know?

04:53.260 --> 04:54.679
And he was involved,

04:54.680 --> 04:56.189
but the cops couldn't get enough, uh,

04:56.190 --> 04:58.443
hard evidence to charge him, you know.

04:58.444 --> 05:02.229
And this guy, Miller,
he was a convicted...

05:02.230 --> 05:05.939
He was convicted of,
uh... fiddling with kids.

05:05.940 --> 05:08.909
And he did some, uh,

05:08.910 --> 05:12.875
some time in jail. And, uh...

05:12.880 --> 05:15.239
With the wife and me, all these years...

05:15.240 --> 05:17.628
it's been hard, mate. Um,

05:17.629 --> 05:21.717
just the not knowing
what happened to Jenny.

05:21.720 --> 05:24.649
And the thing is, uh, I got, uh...

05:24.650 --> 05:27.079
uh, liver cancer, and I
don't have that long,

05:27.080 --> 05:29.259
so I just need someone,

05:29.260 --> 05:31.893
uh, to go and talk to this guy.

05:31.894 --> 05:34.859
And, uh, I just want to know
what happened to my Jenny.

05:34.860 --> 05:39.279
And, um, I don't want to, uh...

05:39.280 --> 05:41.079
I don't want my wife not knowing,

05:41.080 --> 05:43.959
and I don't-I don't want to
leave this world not knowing.

05:43.960 --> 05:47.200
And I'd love to be able to
tell my wife what happened.

05:47.201 --> 05:52.998
And, uh, look, it might be
asking too much, but, um...

05:54.880 --> 05:58.959
You see, we-we...
we never got to bury her.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.672
We never got to close the book.

06:01.673 --> 06:07.599
If you could, uh, find out
what he did with her,

06:07.600 --> 06:11.474
like, her remains...

06:11.475 --> 06:16.647
Just so... we can just visit her.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.820
How old was she?

06:33.680 --> 06:35.457
Thirteen.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.599
Smells good.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.759
Can I help you?

07:36.760 --> 07:38.895
I hope so.

07:38.896 --> 07:41.815
You normally just go walking
into people's houses?

07:41.816 --> 07:44.720
What'd you do with Jenny Greer?

07:46.890 --> 07:49.822
You better get out of here,
or I'll call the cops.

07:52.610 --> 07:54.870
I'm serious.

07:57.090 --> 08:00.559
Look, t... I don't want
any trouble, okay?

08:00.560 --> 08:02.542
Oh, I don't want any trouble, mate.

08:02.543 --> 08:06.131
I don't know this Jenny...
whatever you said her name was.

08:06.132 --> 08:08.479
- Greer.
- Okay, Greer.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.680
Uh-huh.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.220
Take those.

08:17.820 --> 08:19.852
Put 'em on.

08:19.853 --> 08:21.229
What-what...

08:21.230 --> 08:24.760
- Put 'em on.
- Okay.

08:26.026 --> 08:28.729
So, Jenny's dad...

08:28.730 --> 08:30.799
wants to know what happened to her.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.866
I don't know.

08:34.030 --> 08:36.118
He doesn't want the cops involved,

08:36.119 --> 08:38.328
so you're not gonna get into trouble.

08:38.330 --> 08:42.958
He just wants to know what
happened to her, right?

08:42.960 --> 08:44.836
And he wants her remains.

08:46.920 --> 08:51.319
So you tell me what I want to know,

08:51.320 --> 08:52.979
and I'll get the fuck out of here,

08:52.980 --> 08:55.380
and you'll never see me again, okay?

08:55.389 --> 08:58.976
Swear to God, I don't know anything.

09:16.810 --> 09:18.780
I-I've got money.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.029
I don't want your money.

09:30.030 --> 09:32.134
I swear to God, I don't
know where she is.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.600
Yeah, you said that.

09:39.180 --> 09:41.039
What are you gonna do?

09:42.600 --> 09:44.919
Whatever it takes, mate. Come on.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.440
- Come on. All right?
- No!

09:49.240 --> 09:51.179
Ow!

10:36.420 --> 10:37.640
It's pretty good, mate.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.980
What's the herb you got in there?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.210
- Basil.
- Basil?

10:49.211 --> 10:51.999
Lovely.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.419
All right.

10:54.420 --> 10:57.830
You seem like an okay
sort of a bloke, mate.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.220
And I don't want to hurt you.

11:04.060 --> 11:06.019
So just tell me what I want to know,

11:06.020 --> 11:08.105
and I'll get out of your hair.

11:11.010 --> 11:13.799
I really would-would
like to help you, but...

11:13.800 --> 11:18.080
... y-you got the wrong guy, mate.

11:18.920 --> 11:22.780
I mean, I... I know with my...

11:24.250 --> 11:28.399
I know I did some bad
things in the past, but...

11:28.400 --> 11:31.860
I swear, I-I didn't do...

11:32.960 --> 11:35.632
I don't know this Jenny.

11:44.810 --> 11:46.459
I tried to be nice, mate, all right?

11:58.680 --> 12:00.599
You want some more, mate?

12:00.600 --> 12:02.743
Where do you want it?
Where do you want it?

12:02.744 --> 12:05.069
The Otford railway tunnel!

12:12.720 --> 12:14.280
Otford.

12:15.870 --> 12:17.280
That's where she is.

12:22.230 --> 12:24.079
Where in the tunnel?

12:24.080 --> 12:28.799
I don't know, exactly, but...

12:28.800 --> 12:30.560
... that's where I put it.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.229
It?

12:33.230 --> 12:35.519
Her.

12:35.520 --> 12:39.130
That's where I put her, I mean.

12:40.530 --> 12:42.859
I swear to God.

12:42.860 --> 12:45.120
You believe in God, do you?

13:22.960 --> 13:25.490
Right here, left.

14:07.040 --> 14:10.179
Look ahead.

14:10.180 --> 14:13.620
You look at me again,
I'll put one in your head.

15:12.340 --> 15:13.840
Help me get this out the way.

15:32.990 --> 15:35.539
Okay. You help me get this out?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.920
Oh...

18:14.240 --> 18:16.440
Is he in there?

19:31.940 --> 19:39.908
Do you know the pain that you've caused?

20:05.420 --> 20:06.680
I'm sorry.

20:53.773 --> 20:56.010
Thank you.
