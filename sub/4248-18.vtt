11:21.847 --> 11:24.433
- HEY, UM, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.812
- YEAH, ME TOO.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.149
TELL ME THE NUMBERS AGAIN.

11:32.233 --> 11:36.779
- 11, 01, 01, 19, 15.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.114
- AND THIS WAS A DREAM?

11:38.197 --> 11:39.907
- WELL, I MUST HAVE
BEEN DREAMING.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.743
I MEAN, IT WASN'T LIKE ANY DREAM
I'VE HAD BEFORE,

11:42.827 --> 11:45.121
BUT IT FELT SO REAL.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.122
- IT'S WEIRD.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.790
- YEAH, WELL,
ADD THAT TO THE LIST

11:47.873 --> 11:49.458
OF WEIRD THINGS
THAT KEEP HAPPENING.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.502
ANYWAY, WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TELL ME?

11:51.585 --> 11:53.629
- UM...

11:53.712 --> 11:55.423
LOOK, LOOK, I KNOW

11:55.506 --> 11:58.801
YOU'RE GOING TO THINK CALMLY
AND RATIONALLY ABOUT THIS.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.261
BUT THE THING IS,

12:00.344 --> 12:02.930
I'VE KID OF MISPLACED
ONE OF THE LATEST PUZZLE PIECES.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.348
- WHAT?

12:04.432 --> 12:07.393
- I, TOO, HAVE BEEN THINKING
CALMLY AND RATIONALLY ABOUT IT.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.728
AND I THINK IT FELL
OUT OF MY BAG

12:09.812 --> 12:10.980
WHEN I SHOVED IT UP THERE
YESTERDAY.

12:11.063 --> 12:14.358
I THOUGHT THERE WAS GONNA BE
A BAG SEARCH.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.114
EXCELLENT.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.907
IT'S NOT HERE.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.951
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
SWEPT UP LAST NIGHT.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.412
- VICTOR.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.168
- WHAT'S THAT?

12:32.251 --> 12:35.087
- NOTES FOR A CAMPAIGN SPEECH,
SCHOOL REP.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.005
I THINK I COULD BE GOOD
FOR THIS PLACE.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.466
- YEAH?

12:38.549 --> 12:41.469
COMMENDABLE, BUT IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO ACE THE ELECTION, MARA,

12:41.552 --> 12:43.095
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A RED HOT CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.346
<i>MOI.</i>

12:44.430 --> 12:46.765
- I'M INTRIGUED

12:46.849 --> 12:49.310
AND COMPLETELY FRIGHTENED
AT THE SAME TIME.

12:49.393 --> 12:50.603
- SO THAT'S A YES,
ISN'T IT?

12:51.937 --> 12:54.482
[bell chiming]

12:57.526 --> 12:59.487
- I WILL GET IT BACK.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.197
- HOW?

13:01.280 --> 13:02.865
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.575
BUT I WILL.
I PROMISE.

13:04.658 --> 13:08.496
- OKAY, SETTLE DOWN, EVERYONE,
QUICKLY, QUIETLY, PLEASE.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.998
I WANT TO TALK NUMEROLOGY.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.333
- NUMEROLOGY?

13:12.416 --> 13:16.170
SIR, THIS IS A SERIOUS CLASS,
NOT NEW AGE CRUD.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.631
- TODAY WE WOULD LOOK
AT SOMETHING LIKE THIS CHAIR

13:18.714 --> 13:20.257
AND SAY IT ISN'T ALIVE,

13:20.341 --> 13:24.178
BUT THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS
BELIEVED EVERYTHING WAS ALIVE.

13:24.261 --> 13:28.015
THEY BELIEVED EVERYTHING WAS
MADE UP OF LIVING PARTICLES...

13:31.727 --> 13:33.854
AND THAT EVERY PERSON,
EVERY OBJECT

13:33.938 --> 13:35.105
COULD BE REDUCED DOWN

13:35.189 --> 13:38.067
TO WHAT THEY BELIEVED
WERE DIVINE NUMBERS.

13:38.150 --> 13:42.071
THE GOD OSIRIS REPRESENTS
THE FIRST PERFECT ODD NUMBER,

13:42.154 --> 13:43.739
THREE,

13:43.822 --> 13:47.451
WHILST ISIS REPRESENTS
THE NUMBER FOUR.

13:47.535 --> 13:51.914
THE RESULT OF THE TWO
WAS THEIR SON, HORUS,

13:51.997 --> 13:56.001
WHO'S REPRESENTED
BY THE NUMBER FIVE.

13:56.085 --> 13:56.877
- PATRICIA,
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

13:59.755 --> 14:02.633
I SAID IT'S TIME TO COME HOME.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.051
- [screams]

14:12.351 --> 14:15.229
- [sighs]

14:15.312 --> 14:18.357
GUESS THAT'S CLASS DISMISSED.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.694
- YO, TRIXY.

14:24.863 --> 14:27.116
I'D KNOW THOSE BIKER BOOTS
ANYWHERE.

14:27.199 --> 14:31.412
- ALFIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET OFF MY FOOT.

14:31.495 --> 14:32.454
- SO WHAT'S UP?

14:32.538 --> 14:34.331
WHAT'S WITH THE FREAK-OUT
IN CLASS

14:34.415 --> 14:36.750
AND THE HIDING-
IN-THE-LAUNDRY-ROOM BUSINESS?

14:36.834 --> 14:39.211
- FELL ASLEEP IN CLASS.
I HAD A BAD DREAM.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.337
END OF STORY.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.505
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

14:41.589 --> 14:42.715
- OH, SHUT UP, ALFIE.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.883
- NO, I MEAN,
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.677
SINCE MY TRIP,
YOU KNOW,

14:46.760 --> 14:48.512
"LOOK BEHIND YOU.
CREEPY DOG FACE.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.806
SOMETHING HORRIBLE."

14:50.889 --> 14:51.974
WLAHHHH!

14:52.057 --> 14:55.436
- SO WHAT DO YOU DO
TO STOP THE NIGHTMARES?

14:55.519 --> 14:57.062
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.940
I'VE GOT KIND OF AN EVIL DREAM
SURVIVAL KIT,

15:00.024 --> 15:01.775
YOU KNOW,
TORCH UNDER THE SHEETS,

15:01.859 --> 15:04.987
PLAY MUSIC TO GET ME TO SLEEP.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.905
AND ALSO, I TRY
TO HANG AROUND OTHER PEOPLE

15:06.989 --> 15:08.741
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
SO I'M NEVER ALONE.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.410
- THAT'S PATHETIC

15:11.493 --> 15:13.162
BUT SWEET.

15:13.245 --> 15:18.500
- EXCEPT JEROME'S KIND OF
ABANDONED ME FOR MARA RECENTLY.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.710
- OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.838
I'LL HANG OUT WITH YOU
IF YOU HANG OUT WITH ME,

15:22.921 --> 15:25.049
AND THEN HOPEFULLY,
WHATEVER'S GIVING US BAD DREAMS

15:25.132 --> 15:26.675
CAN FIGHT IT OUT BETWEEN THEM.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.177
- YOU'RE ON.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.845
HEY, PATRICIA,
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?

15:29.928 --> 15:32.598
YOU NEVER KNOW; IT MIGHT BE
CONNECTED WITH OUR DREAMS.

15:32.681 --> 15:33.849
IT'S ABOUT ALIENS.

15:33.932 --> 15:35.059
- ALIENS.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.061
YOU'RE NOT STILL GOING ON
ABOUT ALIENS.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.896
- I JUST FINISHED READING
THIS BOOK, RIGHT,

15:38.979 --> 15:41.023
ABOUT ALIENS
AND HOW THEY CAME TO OUR PLANET

15:41.106 --> 15:43.108
IN, LIKE, 3,000 YEARS B.C.

15:43.192 --> 15:46.028
AND THEN I FOUND THIS.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.946
HOW WEIRD IS THAT?

15:50.908 --> 15:51.825
- SO SHE'S DEFINITELY ALL RIGHT.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.703
- YEAH, TOOK ME AGES
TO FIND HER.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.455
SHE'S A BIT EMBARRASSED.
THAT'S ALL.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.332
SO WHEN SHE COMES IN,
NO ONE MENTION IT, OKAY?

15:58.415 --> 15:59.792
- FINE BY ME.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.419
I'VE HAD ENOUGH SCARY TALK
AND SCREAMING FOR ONE DAY.

16:02.503 --> 16:03.879
LISTEN UP, YOU GUYS.

16:03.962 --> 16:07.383
MR. WINKLER SAID THE EGYPTIANS
WERE REALLY BIG ON NUMBEROLOGY.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.592
AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW

16:08.676 --> 16:10.511
HOW TO WORK OUT
YOUR PERFECT LOVE MATCH

16:10.594 --> 16:12.429
BY WORKING OUT YOUR NUMBERS.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.555
ANY TAKERS?

16:13.639 --> 16:15.099
- NO, THANKS.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.935
THERE IS NO SCIENCE
BEHIND THAT WHATSOEVER.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.061
- [whispers]
HEY.

16:23.315 --> 16:27.569
SARAH'S NUMBERS,
WHAT IF THEY'RE COORDINATES?

16:27.653 --> 16:28.904
- HOW CAN YOU EVEN BEGIN
TO THINK ABOUT THAT

16:28.987 --> 16:31.824
WHILE THE PUZZLE PIECES
ARE STILL MISSING?

16:31.907 --> 16:33.075
- I'M SORRY.

16:33.158 --> 16:37.079
LOOK, I WILL NOT GIVE UP

16:37.162 --> 16:40.082
ON SARAH, THE QUEST,
AND CERTAINLY NOT ON YOU.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.586
- THANKS.
[laughs]

16:44.670 --> 16:46.004
THAT MEANS A LOT.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.469
WOW.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.513
IS IT HOT IN HERE?

16:54.596 --> 16:56.598
- MR. SWEET?

16:56.682 --> 16:58.434
MY PERFECT LOVE MATCH
IS OLD SWEETIE?

16:58.517 --> 17:00.394
- [laughs]

17:00.477 --> 17:02.312
- [shudders]

17:02.396 --> 17:04.021
- SORRY, ALFIE.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.316
LIKE I SAID,
THE NUMBERS NEVER LIE.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.152
IT'S SCIENCE.

17:08.234 --> 17:12.740
NINA, LET'S WORK OUT
YOUR NUMBER

17:12.823 --> 17:15.075
AND THEN MAYBE FABIAN'S.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.457
- LOST SOMETHING?

17:21.540 --> 17:22.249
- SORRY?

17:25.836 --> 17:26.670
[gasps]

17:26.753 --> 17:28.088
WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS?

17:28.172 --> 17:28.547
PATRICIA, I COULD KISS YOU.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.258
- DON'T.

17:36.430 --> 17:39.266
[mysterious music]

17:40.726 --> 17:42.728
- [scoffs]

17:44.229 --> 17:45.939
[laughs lightly]

17:48.484 --> 17:50.569
A.L.?

17:50.652 --> 17:51.445
ALFIE LEWIS!

17:51.528 --> 17:54.865
WHOA!

17:54.948 --> 17:57.534
OH.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.620
E.T.'S GONE HOME.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.955
- DOES ANYONE KNOW

18:02.039 --> 18:04.291
IF ROBERT PATTINSON'S
GOT ANY MIDDLE NAMES?

18:04.374 --> 18:05.167
- GUYS, WHERE'S ALFIE?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.585
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING ME.

18:06.668 --> 18:10.923
- AMBER, I WAS WONDERING

18:11.006 --> 18:14.009
IF YOU COULD DO MY NUMBERS
AND MICK'S.

18:14.092 --> 18:15.803
IS THAT TOO WEIRD?

18:17.221 --> 18:18.180
- NO.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.932
NO, NOT AT ALL.

18:20.015 --> 18:21.350
I AM SO, LIKE, OVER MICK,

18:21.433 --> 18:24.686
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
I'M IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE.

18:24.770 --> 18:29.566
SO, UM, WRITE DOWN YOUR
FULL NAME AND DATE OF BIRTH.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.528
- I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
INTO ALL THAT HOKUM, MARA.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.614
- OH, JEROME.
DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.366
IT'S JUST FOR GIGGLE.

18:37.449 --> 18:41.119
- SO MICK'S A FOUR, WHICH MEANS
HE'S GONNA BE REALLY SUCCESSFUL,

18:41.203 --> 18:42.704
WHICH IS WHY I GOT WITH HIM
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

18:42.788 --> 18:43.789
EVEN THOUGH I'M A NINE,

18:43.872 --> 18:45.499
WHICH MEANS I'M A LITTLE
MORE CREATIVE

18:45.582 --> 18:46.708
AND NOT REALLY SUITED TO A FOUR.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.044
ANYWAY, IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.

18:49.127 --> 18:51.171
UH, SO, UM...

18:51.255 --> 18:53.423
LET'S SEE.
YOU'RE A...

18:53.507 --> 18:54.174
- WHAT?

18:56.802 --> 18:59.054
YOU'RE A FOUR.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.850
PERFECT MATCH.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.102
- DON'T THEY SAY TO GO

19:05.185 --> 19:06.603
TO SOMEONE WHO'S DIFFERENT
FROM YOU?

19:06.687 --> 19:09.314
- NOT IN THIS CHART, NO.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.734
SO CONGRATS.
WELL DONE.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.279
GO...GET HIM.

19:23.829 --> 19:27.499
- OKAY, SO HERE IS A MAP
OF THE HOUSE.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.251
IF SARAH'S NUMBERS
ARE COORDINATES,

19:29.334 --> 19:30.419
WE'LL BE ABLE TO USE THIS
TO PINPOINT A LOCATION,

19:30.502 --> 19:33.338
WHICH, IN TURN, MAY LEAD US
TO ANOTHER CLUE.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.923
- THEY'RE NOT COORDINATES,
FABIAN.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.968
- THEY'RE NOT?

19:38.051 --> 19:39.344
SARAH'S AN 11,

19:39.428 --> 19:40.929
THE SAME AS ME.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.931
- HUH?

19:43.015 --> 19:45.475
- IT'S SARAH'S NUMEROLOGY NUMBER
AND HER DATE OF BIRTH.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.522
11.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.483
01.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.569
[rumbling]

19:55.652 --> 19:57.112
- WHAT WAS THAT?

19:57.195 --> 19:59.573
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S FREAKING ME OUT.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.700
- 01.

20:01.783 --> 20:05.787
- IT'S 10:00.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.955
YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.709
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES PRECISELY.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.127
- 15.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.212
[rumbling]

20:24.932 --> 20:28.101
GUYS, I DON'T WANT
TO ALARM ANYONE,

20:28.185 --> 20:30.812
BUT I THINK THE HOUSE MAY BE...

20:30.896 --> 20:34.066
COMING TO LIFE.
