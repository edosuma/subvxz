- Can I say something?

40:11.169 --> 40:13.171
- Sure.

40:18.737 --> 40:21.220
- I know that you want to know
what's going on with me.

40:22.541 --> 40:24.543
But...

40:25.424 --> 40:27.687
I'm feeling a hundred things
at once,

40:27.787 --> 40:33.172
and most of 'em
are about how...messed up I am.

40:33.272 --> 40:35.695
You and I both thought
that moving back here

40:35.795 --> 40:37.177
was gonna make my bad dreams
go away.

40:37.277 --> 40:38.738
But it didn't.

40:38.838 --> 40:42.502
So...I started to wonder
if it was maybe something else.

40:42.602 --> 40:44.604
- Something like me?
- No.

40:48.208 --> 40:50.210
Me.

40:50.691 --> 40:53.794
Nothing in my life
feels right right now.

40:53.894 --> 40:56.917
I don't feel right...
right now.

40:57.017 --> 40:58.759
And I don't know.

40:58.859 --> 41:00.921
There's no one to blame for it,
but...

41:01.021 --> 41:03.164
I don't know
how to fix it, either.

41:03.264 --> 41:05.266
- Well--
[sighs]

41:05.826 --> 41:07.829
I mean...

41:08.309 --> 41:10.652
Do you think
we rushed into this?

41:10.752 --> 41:13.174
I mean maybe--
maybe I pushed you

41:13.274 --> 41:15.337
when deep down,
I knew it was probably too soon

41:15.437 --> 41:16.978
after your dad.

41:17.078 --> 41:20.302
Maybe I just wanted
to be with you so badly that...

41:20.402 --> 41:21.823
I was willing to go for it.

41:21.923 --> 41:25.107
- I wanted to go for it too.

41:25.207 --> 41:27.189
But I'm barely ever
present with you

41:27.289 --> 41:32.354
because I'm sad
or tired or just...

41:32.454 --> 41:33.676
in my head all the time.

41:33.776 --> 41:35.237
And I hate it, and it's--

41:35.337 --> 41:36.999
- I--I know.

41:37.099 --> 41:39.101
- It's not fair to you.

41:40.623 --> 41:42.885
Maybe I do need more time.

[somber music]

41:44.507 --> 41:47.190
- We should...put things
on pause for a bit.

41:50.674 --> 41:52.135
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

41:52.235 --> 41:54.237
Hey--hey, look.

41:56.199 --> 41:59.022
If we both force this thing

41:59.122 --> 42:01.125
to happen before you're ready,
then...

42:01.885 --> 42:03.988
We'll destroy it
before it's even begun.
