00:00.042 --> 00:01.709
Previously, on "Below Deck
Sailing Yacht"...

00:01.709 --> 00:04.626
Yas, queens!

00:04.626 --> 00:07.167
I wrote him off in
the beginning, but...

00:07.167 --> 00:08.626
[moans]

00:08.626 --> 00:11.626
he doesn't act like
a 23-year-old in bed.

00:11.626 --> 00:20.959
This bed's big enough
for all three of us!

00:20.959 --> 00:23.501
So, what are they saying, is he
gonna be all right, or?

00:23.501 --> 00:26.959
My best friend's dad is on
life support in the hospital.

00:26.959 --> 00:28.584
It's not good.

00:28.584 --> 00:30.250
Do you think you need to go
there, or do you need some time?

00:30.250 --> 00:35.125
I'm... no, I'm...
I need to be here now.

00:35.125 --> 00:36.959
When something like
this happens,

00:36.959 --> 00:42.584
it's gonna make your job harder
than it already is.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.167
No, not yet.

00:44.167 --> 00:45.584
I have no problem
respecting you.

00:45.584 --> 00:47.501
You lead the way I wanna be led.

00:47.501 --> 00:50.959
The second stew is entitled
to delegate to the third stew.

00:50.959 --> 00:52.792
That's just
a normal thing to do.

00:52.792 --> 00:54.417
Honestly Tom did this
by himself, so...

00:54.417 --> 00:56.209
All right,
we don't need attitude.

00:56.209 --> 00:57.209
Shut up.

00:57.209 --> 00:58.501
[bleep].

00:58.501 --> 01:00.417
-Colin, catch some wind.
-I'm trying.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.042
There's no wind.

01:02.042 --> 01:03.459
If you need anything,
just wake me up.

01:03.459 --> 01:14.417
Yeah, have a good sleep, buddy.

01:14.417 --> 01:18.542
[snoring]

01:18.542 --> 01:28.334
[alarm beeping]

01:28.334 --> 01:52.375
[alarm beeping]

01:52.375 --> 02:01.459
[bleep]

02:01.459 --> 02:07.584
Oh, he's up.

02:07.584 --> 02:09.417
-Yeah.
-[bleep]

02:09.417 --> 02:10.959
We're sat in two
meters of water.

02:10.959 --> 02:19.542
It's just blowing
us straight over.

02:19.542 --> 02:23.709
[knocking]

02:23.709 --> 02:48.167
Are we gonna run
aground here?

02:48.167 --> 03:02.334
Yeah?

03:02.334 --> 03:08.459
[ship's horn]

03:08.459 --> 03:10.209
Would you like
a coffee or anything?

03:10.209 --> 03:11.626
-Um...
-Yeah?

03:11.626 --> 03:13.959
You just feel this sinking
feeling in your stomach

03:13.959 --> 03:15.959
that I've never felt
before at sea.

03:15.959 --> 03:18.334
This is a hundred times
worse than hitting the dock.

03:18.334 --> 03:20.626
Morning, guys.

03:20.626 --> 03:22.959
Anyone else like a coffee?

03:22.959 --> 03:32.375
I just want these
people to be calm.

03:32.375 --> 03:38.334
But they can obviously tell that
things are not fine right now.

03:38.334 --> 03:40.501
Thank you.

03:40.501 --> 04:11.375
This is the almond milk.

04:11.375 --> 04:13.459
The keel, the bottom part
of the boat,

04:13.459 --> 04:15.584
is trying to push
through the sand,

04:15.584 --> 04:18.042
and if we don't move now
into deep enough water,

04:18.042 --> 04:21.667
we're gonna get stuck aground,
and we won't be able to get off.

04:21.667 --> 04:25.667
We need to wait for
these waves to come.

04:25.667 --> 04:27.167
Any swell that we had will help.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.626
We're trying to do it
in the tender,

04:28.626 --> 04:35.375
but it doesn't create
a big enough wake.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.292
So, what we're doing on top
of that

04:37.292 --> 04:41.042
is we're using the thrusters to
wiggle our way out of the sand,

04:41.042 --> 04:55.000
and then we can safely
pick up the anchor.

04:55.000 --> 05:08.042
It literally came like that.

05:08.042 --> 05:09.501
Would you like a Bloody Mary?

05:09.501 --> 05:11.250
-Two, please.
-I'll have another mimosa.

05:11.250 --> 05:12.501
I feel motion there.

05:12.501 --> 05:22.792
Check your anchor chain.

05:22.792 --> 05:42.167
Okay, copy that.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.501
----ing hell, we were
very lucky

05:44.501 --> 05:48.000
that we could fix
this ourselves.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.334
Yay, woo!

05:49.334 --> 05:51.959
Let's have a Bloody Mary
and celebrate!

05:51.959 --> 05:54.792
The guests are safe,
we're safe, the boat is safe.

05:54.792 --> 05:57.751
But right now, I need
to wrap my head around this.

05:57.751 --> 06:02.709
I need to process this,
what happened.

06:02.709 --> 06:05.792
Is that what...

06:05.792 --> 06:07.501
-Tom?
-Yes.

06:07.501 --> 06:13.751
Dude...

06:13.751 --> 06:17.792
We didn't start dragging until
the alarm went off, like...

06:17.792 --> 06:21.375
Yeah, yeah, I do.

06:21.375 --> 06:23.709
Yeah, but there wasn't when
I was going down there.

06:23.709 --> 06:25.584
It was...
everything was fine.

06:25.584 --> 06:28.000
It's gonna take us five or
10 minutes to drag.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.292
You know, that was
400 meters, that's...

06:30.292 --> 06:31.375
Yeah, but by the time
you'd got up,

06:31.375 --> 06:33.375
we'd already been going.

06:33.375 --> 06:34.751
No, I woke up from touching.

06:34.751 --> 06:36.375
Okay.

06:36.375 --> 06:42.292
This just started going
really fast, like, this way.

06:42.292 --> 06:43.792
-Okay.
-I know it's...

06:43.792 --> 06:45.167
-I know we were...
-Most important thing...

06:45.167 --> 06:47.000
-most important takeaway...
-Yeah.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.042
When you're on night watch, any
question whatsoever, like...

06:49.042 --> 06:50.959
Yeah.

06:50.959 --> 06:56.209
Anything doesn't seem right,
come and get me right away.

06:56.209 --> 06:57.584
Maybe just go up
and say

06:57.584 --> 06:59.042
how do you feel about
breakfast at 9:00?

06:59.042 --> 07:00.167
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:00.167 --> 07:01.334
Remember, 9:00's a normal time.

07:01.334 --> 07:09.667
That was exciting, huh?

07:09.667 --> 07:14.125
Okay.

07:14.125 --> 07:16.334
Whoa.

07:16.334 --> 07:18.167
Tom, control the temper.

07:18.167 --> 07:19.501
What's wrong?

07:19.501 --> 07:20.501
I know they're going to
try and blame me,

07:20.501 --> 07:21.501
because I was on night watch...

07:21.501 --> 07:23.334
Calm down.

07:23.334 --> 07:24.375
I'm pretty sure nobody has
come to you and been, like,

07:24.375 --> 07:26.083
"This is your ----ing fault."

07:26.083 --> 07:27.709
No, but Glenn said, like,
"Dude, you gotta tell me."

07:27.709 --> 07:29.792
And I'm like, "Tell you what?
Everything was fine."

07:29.792 --> 07:32.792
I'm more than capable of
doing an anchor watch.

07:32.792 --> 07:34.584
It just happened so fast.

07:34.584 --> 07:35.959
It seems to be on this boat
I'm learning everything

07:35.959 --> 07:37.250
the ----ing hard way.

07:37.250 --> 07:41.626
-This is...
-I'm going to bed.

07:41.626 --> 07:43.375
Does anyone need anything?

07:43.375 --> 07:44.501
I think Tyler and I would
have another of these, yeah.

07:44.501 --> 07:45.626
Another marg? Okay.

07:45.626 --> 07:47.542
-Okay.
-Thank you.

07:47.542 --> 07:48.584
You know what's the funniest
thing, we've been out here

07:48.584 --> 07:50.667
for a few days and no wind,

07:50.667 --> 07:53.250
no sailing, and then all of
a sudden it was, like,

07:53.250 --> 07:55.083
it could have blown
us to Madrid.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.542
And now it's, like,
back to almost calm again.

07:57.542 --> 07:59.125
-Well, good morning.
-Good morning.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.292
How'd you sleep?

08:00.292 --> 08:02.292
Great, lots of excitement here

08:02.292 --> 08:03.375
when everything
started happening.

08:03.375 --> 08:04.584
-Great.
-What was "everything?"

08:04.584 --> 08:07.334
-You missed it?
-Wait, I was sleeping.

08:07.334 --> 08:09.167
-Oh my God.
-Yeah, like, an hour ago.

08:09.167 --> 08:10.792
We were, like, we hit ground,
and we were, like, stopped.

08:10.792 --> 08:12.501
-On sand.
-Yeah.

08:12.501 --> 08:14.167
I thought so, I thought
I felt something!

08:14.167 --> 08:17.083
What the flying [bleep]?

08:17.083 --> 08:22.125
I thought we were sailing.

08:22.125 --> 08:23.459
So, what happened here?

08:23.459 --> 08:25.042
So, I heard the alarm.

08:25.042 --> 08:26.751
I'm a light sleeper, so
I got up straightaway,

08:26.751 --> 08:28.125
and I heard an
engine room alarm.

08:28.125 --> 08:29.667
So, I was looking
in the bilge...

08:29.667 --> 08:31.334
Could you feel the boat
heeling at that point?

08:31.334 --> 08:32.542
-Yeah.
-But we weren't aground?

08:32.542 --> 08:34.501
No, not at that point.

08:34.501 --> 08:37.792
It's probably around 5:45
that Tom

08:37.792 --> 08:39.751
said he thinks we're dragging.

08:39.751 --> 08:42.709
5:45, that was 10 minutes
before I got up.

08:42.709 --> 08:44.959
It's 15 minutes before I got up.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.042
And that was... that's long
enough to drag ashore,

08:46.042 --> 08:47.042
10 minutes, yeah.

08:47.042 --> 08:48.959
-Yep.
-Yeah.

08:48.959 --> 08:50.459
When he said he was dragging,
he didn't come and get anyone.

08:50.459 --> 08:53.584
We woke up ourselves because
we felt it heeling over.

08:53.584 --> 08:55.250
I heard him say it, yeah,
I don't...

08:55.250 --> 08:57.000
You heard him say,
"I think we're dragging."

08:57.000 --> 09:00.167
And then I came up, and
that's when it all went off.

09:00.167 --> 09:02.042
The fact that he says we
think we're dragging

09:02.042 --> 09:05.292
and he didn't do anything about
it makes me worry a little bit.

09:05.292 --> 09:06.792
And it was already 30 knots.

09:06.792 --> 09:09.626
It was 21, 22 knots
at 5:00 in the morning.

09:09.626 --> 09:11.209
He could have got me up,
I would have sat here.

09:11.209 --> 09:12.584
Imagine we ended up
on the rocks?

09:12.584 --> 09:14.667
Then that's all
of our lives affected.

09:14.667 --> 09:17.209
There's a boat in Indonesia
right now

09:17.209 --> 09:19.542
similar to Parsifal
up on the beach,

09:19.542 --> 09:21.167
and she's been there for,
like, a year.

09:21.167 --> 09:23.083
So, we got off lightly.

09:23.083 --> 09:28.542
It could have been a lot worse,
and that's a scary thought.

09:28.542 --> 09:30.667
We're leaving
at 10:00, one hour.

09:30.667 --> 09:32.792
Between now and then,
I wanna dive.

09:32.792 --> 09:34.292
Dive under the boat
and check the hull.

09:34.292 --> 09:35.375
You want me to do it?

09:35.375 --> 09:37.000
Yeah, let's do that right now.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.501
As soon as that's good,
we know we're good.

09:39.501 --> 09:43.125
We have bacon, French toast,
cheese, cold cut, fruit plates.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.459
You guys are welcome to sit.

09:45.459 --> 09:53.209
What a harrowing day,
and it's only 9:30.

09:53.209 --> 09:55.125
----ing hell.

09:55.125 --> 09:58.292
Frittata is asparagus,
onions, ham, and cheese.

09:58.292 --> 10:00.584
-French toast, scrambled eggs...
-Oh, that's beautiful.

10:00.584 --> 10:02.709
I'd like to try
some of the tortilla.

10:02.709 --> 10:04.375
Oh, that is tasty.

10:04.375 --> 10:05.709
That is so good.

10:05.709 --> 10:07.501
It's okay.
Everything's fine.

10:07.501 --> 10:24.417
Yeah.
That's good.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.250
Have a good look at
the rudder and the keel,

10:26.250 --> 10:27.709
all along the bottom.

10:27.709 --> 10:29.584
Whenever you touch the bottom
of the ocean,

10:29.584 --> 10:31.375
you have to go under the boat

10:31.375 --> 10:32.626
to see what damage was
actually done.

10:32.626 --> 10:34.083
If you see anything shocking,

10:34.083 --> 10:35.959
come back and tell me
right away,

10:35.959 --> 10:37.667
because I'll go have a look
before that tank's empty.

10:37.667 --> 10:40.667
We were completely run aground,

10:40.667 --> 10:44.459
dragging this keel well
and truly up onto the beach.

10:44.459 --> 10:47.083
I'm worried about
this ----ing keel.

10:47.083 --> 10:49.959
If this keel is structurally
damaged in some way,

10:49.959 --> 10:49.959
this boat cannot sail.

10:49.959 --> 10:58.626
Previously, on "Below Deck
Sailing Yacht"...

10:58.626 --> 11:09.667
I'm worried about
this ----ing keel.

11:09.667 --> 11:12.501
It's super important for me
to check for any cracks,

11:12.501 --> 11:16.375
any holes, any damaged bits
of aluminum

11:16.375 --> 11:20.167
that hold this boat together.

11:20.167 --> 11:23.167
You can clearly see where
the rocks or stones

11:23.167 --> 11:30.000
have scratched the sh-- out
of the bottom of the keel.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.375
What's the verdict?

11:31.375 --> 11:34.375
It's definitely pretty
scratched up,

11:34.375 --> 11:36.292
big sections of
antifoul missing.

11:36.292 --> 11:37.709
Uh-huh.

11:37.709 --> 11:40.042
-Rudder looks good?
-The rudder's untouched.

11:40.042 --> 11:41.083
Untouched, good.

11:41.083 --> 11:42.459
No cracks or anything.

11:42.459 --> 11:44.292
No, that's what we're
looking for.

11:44.292 --> 11:46.209
-I think it's fine, man.
-I think it's fine, yeah.

11:46.209 --> 11:48.000
That's good news.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.125
Couple minutes, you can fire up,
and then we'll get going.

11:51.125 --> 11:52.542
Okay.

11:52.542 --> 11:57.083
Pick up the anchor
and get outta here.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.584
Yes, I'm finished,
thank you so much.

11:58.584 --> 12:00.250
I'm gonna go pack.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.709
Okay, I'm in gear.
Which way is the chain?

12:01.709 --> 12:07.667
Six... 7:00.

12:07.667 --> 12:14.417
Anchor's at the waterline.

12:14.417 --> 12:15.709
The party's over, eh?

12:15.709 --> 12:17.250
Good to go?

12:17.250 --> 12:18.709
Of course, it would have
been good to sail.

12:18.709 --> 12:20.250
Here, let me put it
on your shoulder...

12:20.250 --> 12:21.792
-Yeah?
-Got it, thanks.

12:21.792 --> 12:26.167
-You sure?
-Yep.

12:26.167 --> 12:28.709
I'm coming ahead just a touch.

12:28.709 --> 12:32.375
-Are we lined up?
-Yeah, that's fine.

12:32.375 --> 12:33.792
You're throwing him
a heaving line

12:33.792 --> 12:35.042
that's not even connected
to anything.

12:35.042 --> 12:37.167
What?
Why would you put...

12:37.167 --> 12:39.292
----ing hell, this is
literally the cherry on top.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.542
It's miniscule, but it's
just another [bleep] up.

12:41.542 --> 12:44.250
All crew, all crew,
let's get everybody on the dock.

12:44.250 --> 12:45.584
When do we get our shoes back?

12:45.584 --> 12:50.459
They're in the basket
at the end.

12:50.459 --> 12:51.667
-Thank you.
-You're very welcome.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.292
Glad you had a good time.

12:53.292 --> 12:55.375
Thank you so much,
you guys were awesome.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.584
Nice to meet you, thanks for
all your hard work.

12:57.584 --> 12:58.834
Captain Glenn, you're the best.

12:58.834 --> 13:00.501
Oh, thanks for
everything, James.

13:00.501 --> 13:01.501
I'm coming to sail
with you again, for sure.

13:01.501 --> 13:02.792
Yes, definitely.

13:02.792 --> 13:04.542
This was a big deal,
because my family

13:04.542 --> 13:06.209
and I don't get to spend
this kind of time together.

13:06.209 --> 13:07.792
And we had fun at every turn.

13:07.792 --> 13:11.209
This morning, almost being
yacht on the rocks was,

13:11.209 --> 13:13.334
like, a very unique experience.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.792
That's the only reason
we did it.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.375
Well, good job, we loved it.

13:16.375 --> 13:17.751
Thanks for being such
good sports about it.

13:17.751 --> 13:19.209
-This is for you.
-Thank you very much.

13:19.209 --> 13:20.209
-My pleasure.
-Thank you very much.

13:20.209 --> 13:21.584
Thank you, we had a great time.

13:21.584 --> 13:22.792
-It was nice to meet you all.
-Thank you.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.959
You guys keep waving.

13:24.959 --> 13:26.167
Well, that was fun.

13:26.167 --> 13:27.250
[ship's horn]

13:27.250 --> 13:29.334
Woo!

13:29.334 --> 13:31.501
That's not the first time
we heard that today.

13:31.501 --> 13:35.667
Yeah.

13:35.667 --> 13:49.584
I... I...

13:49.584 --> 13:55.709
All crew, all crew, let's meet
in the saloon for a tip meeting.

13:55.709 --> 14:02.417
-Dah, dah, dah.
-Oh [bleep].

14:02.417 --> 14:04.167
Okay.
All right.

14:04.167 --> 14:08.167
So, this morning, we had
----ing not a very good thing,

14:08.167 --> 14:11.751
and I think it could have been
and should have been avoided.

14:11.751 --> 14:15.709
We dragged about
seven boat lengths

14:15.709 --> 14:18.167
before I was even woken up.

14:18.167 --> 14:19.792
That's a big, big issue.

14:19.792 --> 14:22.167
We have to solve that problem,

14:22.167 --> 14:24.167
and I'm saying it to everyone
because it's our boat.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.626
This is our home, this is
our job, our livelihood,

14:26.626 --> 14:29.375
and what happened this morning
could have ended all that.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.375
We got very lucky.

14:31.375 --> 14:34.584
So, anybody thinks
the boat's dragging,

14:34.584 --> 14:36.167
----ing come wake us.

14:36.167 --> 14:39.042
Don't think any
more beyond that.

14:39.042 --> 14:42.375
So, let's get on
to some better news.

14:42.375 --> 14:44.375
The tip, I think they
really enjoyed themselves,

14:44.375 --> 14:45.792
and it's reflected.

14:45.792 --> 14:49.334
The total tip was $16,000,

14:49.334 --> 14:52.334
and per person, it's 1,778,

14:52.334 --> 14:55.125
so just under 1,800,
so, well done.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.417
Yay.

14:57.417 --> 14:58.542
Even things out.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.375
All right?

15:00.375 --> 15:04.709
That's a huge tip, considering
we almost killed you.

15:04.709 --> 15:08.000
Like, oh, my God, thanks?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.584
So, for tonight, I want you
guys to have fun, be safe.

15:10.584 --> 15:13.792
-All right.
-Cheers, guys.

15:13.792 --> 15:16.083
Let's do another hour,
finish at 4:00,

15:16.083 --> 15:20.709
and then we'll start at
10:00 tomorrow morning.

15:20.709 --> 15:23.042
Is this done, the floor,
the one, the master?

15:23.042 --> 15:24.250
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.417
Buh!

15:27.417 --> 15:29.250
What a morning.

15:29.250 --> 15:30.792
Not ideal, but there's no
damages, no one was injured.

15:30.792 --> 15:32.584
But one thing I don't understand

15:32.584 --> 15:35.250
is you said to Ashley that
you think we're dragging.

15:35.250 --> 15:36.501
She ----ing said that?

15:36.501 --> 15:37.501
Because I was went straight up
here.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.417
No, she... you said...

15:39.417 --> 15:40.417
yeah, she said she heard you
saying "I think we're dragging."

15:40.417 --> 15:42.042
To Colin when he...

15:42.042 --> 15:43.667
when then we were
running around.

15:43.667 --> 15:48.375
I didn't go,
"Ooh, I think we're dragging."

15:48.375 --> 15:49.959
Next time, wake me up.

15:49.959 --> 15:51.584
I do not mind whatsoever.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.334
You finished the head that fast?

15:53.334 --> 15:54.751
I don't think anybody
showered, really,

15:54.751 --> 15:56.375
this morning, so most
of the towels are...

15:56.375 --> 15:57.501
Damn.

15:57.501 --> 16:01.167
How you doing, dude?

16:01.167 --> 16:02.709
That we ran aground was
just something

16:02.709 --> 16:04.584
that I'm not gonna be
able to forget about

16:04.584 --> 16:07.000
-very easily, I don't think.
-Mm.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.334
I don't want that
to happen again,

16:08.334 --> 16:10.167
and I just
don't feel confident.

16:10.167 --> 16:12.125
Yeah.

16:12.125 --> 16:15.209
Now I've gotta go through the
rest of the season worrying

16:15.209 --> 16:18.042
about us dragging anchor
again, or other things.

16:18.042 --> 16:19.667
I mean, I feel exactly
the same way.

16:19.667 --> 16:23.250
I know Tom wasn't
purposely negligent,

16:23.250 --> 16:25.459
but he dropped
the ball big time.

16:25.459 --> 16:27.584
He should have felt the boat.

16:27.584 --> 16:30.125
He should have been checking
the wind gauge

16:30.125 --> 16:36.792
and seeing that it's gone
from 15 knots to 35 knots.

16:36.792 --> 16:39.250
Honestly, I don't
think I've ever been through

16:39.250 --> 16:41.167
as much ----ing drama
on one boat

16:41.167 --> 16:43.417
in one week in my whole life.

16:43.417 --> 16:45.292
----ing mental.

16:45.292 --> 16:48.375
We're done cleaning.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.042
Might just need to wipe
a few things tomorrow.

16:50.042 --> 16:51.459
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:51.459 --> 16:54.209
No, that's still great,
though, well done.

16:54.209 --> 16:55.584
Hey, guys, yeah,
let's wrap it up.

16:55.584 --> 17:02.751
Good job,
we'll finish up tomorrow.

17:02.751 --> 17:07.709
Hey!

17:07.709 --> 17:12.083
We can be two
matching boys, woo!

17:12.083 --> 17:17.167
Yeah, boo, we look good.

17:17.167 --> 17:18.584
Fine.

17:18.584 --> 17:20.334
I mean, something I
feel like I don't know

17:20.334 --> 17:22.083
if I'm gonna get
a snippy response

17:22.083 --> 17:24.167
or if I'm gonna get a nice
response, but it's fine.

17:24.167 --> 17:25.584
Everything's fine.

17:25.584 --> 17:27.167
-Looking very pretty.
-I know.

17:27.167 --> 17:29.083
I was actually just
looking in the mirror

17:29.083 --> 17:31.083
-and talking to myself.
-[laughing]

17:31.083 --> 17:32.709
-Where are all the boys?
-Sleeping?

17:32.709 --> 17:34.542
I mean, I haven't even
talked to them,

17:34.542 --> 17:37.250
but sh--, Tom's not happy.

17:37.250 --> 17:39.375
He's great, funny,
hilarious, love him,

17:39.375 --> 17:41.667
but he's like, "It's not my
fault, it's not my fault,"

17:41.667 --> 17:43.167
and I hate that sh--.

17:43.167 --> 17:45.250
It's a lesson
for us all to learn.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.667
This is why I'm not into,
like, guys my age.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.167
I just wish I hadn't,
like, slept with him,

17:49.167 --> 17:50.709
because now I feel weird.

17:50.709 --> 17:56.083
All right ----ing let's get
this show on the road.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.375
I'm getting ----ed up tonight.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.792
You do that.

17:58.792 --> 17:59.876
So I can't remember
any bad decisions.

17:59.876 --> 18:01.250
It wasn't a bad decision.

18:01.250 --> 18:03.083
It maybe was
a premature decision.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.375
Yeah, but...

18:05.375 --> 18:06.667
What?

18:06.667 --> 18:08.083
Oh.

18:08.083 --> 18:09.584
Ah!

18:09.584 --> 18:11.292
-Oh!
-It's back.

18:11.292 --> 18:16.000
I tried to avoid
for a few days, I tried.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.334
If it happens, it happens.

18:17.334 --> 18:18.709
Everything is
a game to this bitch.

18:18.709 --> 18:20.834
Sometimes being too confident
comes back

18:20.834 --> 18:23.626
to bite you in the ass, and
she's gonna learn the hard way.

18:23.626 --> 18:26.501
Wow, you're gonna
break Tom's heart.

18:26.501 --> 18:28.125
Coming up...

18:28.125 --> 18:30.375
-You're a ----ing joke.
-That's fine, Tom.

18:30.375 --> 18:34.375
Is this the biggest [bleep]
you to my sh--ty day?

18:34.375 --> 18:36.584
If you had any loyalty
about you...

18:36.584 --> 18:38.083
-You...
-No, you haven't.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.626
-Oh.
-And do you know what?

18:39.626 --> 18:46.751
You're full of sh--.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.792
Is everyone ready
for a lovely dinner?

18:48.792 --> 18:50.751
I wanna be in front.

18:50.751 --> 18:53.417
How do I end up
with all the dudes?

18:53.417 --> 18:55.709
-Kelsie!
-Yay.

18:55.709 --> 18:56.834
You clean up nice.

18:56.834 --> 18:58.501
Oh, thank you.

18:58.501 --> 19:05.125
It's tequila day!

19:05.125 --> 19:06.125
which, number one, is a problem.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.209
Wow.

19:07.209 --> 19:08.542
Because you can't be relaxed

19:08.542 --> 19:10.334
when the wind's getting
----ing crazy.

19:10.334 --> 19:11.417
I've just got used to
the fact of thinking

19:11.417 --> 19:12.792
nothing's gonna happen.

19:12.792 --> 19:14.292
Well, I've been on boats
and people have got

19:14.292 --> 19:15.626
fired for less than that.

19:15.626 --> 19:17.626
It was an accident,
we all make accidents.

19:17.626 --> 19:20.792
-You'll never do that again.
-Do it again... no.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.459
Do you wanna get slapped today?

19:22.459 --> 19:24.417
Ooh... kiss me
first, though.

19:24.417 --> 19:25.626
No, Gary, no.

19:25.626 --> 19:27.501
We are building a friendship.

19:27.501 --> 19:28.792
Okay.
Just a friendship.

19:28.792 --> 19:32.626
For now...

19:32.626 --> 19:35.584
Okay, show time, guys.

19:35.584 --> 19:37.709
-I love this.
-Oh, I like this.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.375
Oh, this is cute...

19:39.375 --> 19:40.375
right in the middle
of the street.

19:40.375 --> 19:41.584
Ladies.

19:41.584 --> 19:46.542
[speaking Spanish]

19:46.542 --> 19:49.792
-Ooh, gracias.
-Salud!

19:49.792 --> 19:52.584
Great charter, guys.

19:52.584 --> 19:54.167
That's ----ing tequila.

19:54.167 --> 19:56.209
Si, vamos.

19:56.209 --> 19:57.792
I don't think I can do that.

19:57.792 --> 19:59.209
Can I get the gazpacho?

19:59.209 --> 20:00.667
Gazpacho.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.417
Can I do the tuna salad and
the grilled vegetables?

20:02.417 --> 20:03.709
And the vegetables.

20:03.709 --> 20:05.417
Would you like to share
the oxtail stewed

20:05.417 --> 20:06.626
with sherry and red
wine with me?

20:06.626 --> 20:08.292
That sounds delicious.

20:08.292 --> 20:09.501
That actually does sound
really good... yes.

20:09.501 --> 20:10.709
-Yeah.
-Yay.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.542
I'm going for a wee.

20:12.542 --> 20:14.542
-Your back's a bit sweaty, what?
-It's not sweaty.

20:14.542 --> 20:18.209
It is... oh, you...
It's not, it's not.

20:18.209 --> 20:20.167
-No.
-Oh, my God.

20:20.167 --> 20:22.375
I haven't been that horny,
so it doesn't really matter.

20:22.375 --> 20:23.834
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.417
If you get laid when you're
not that horny

20:25.417 --> 20:27.209
and I can't get laid when
I'm super horny,

20:27.209 --> 20:28.209
then I don't know what
the [bleep] I'm doing.

20:28.209 --> 20:29.375
I mean, you can get laid.

20:29.375 --> 20:31.292
No, she can't... no, that's...

20:31.292 --> 20:33.751
if you're pointing at me, thank
you very much, she's my friend,

20:33.751 --> 20:36.501
and I don't [bleep]
my friends.

20:36.501 --> 20:37.834
I make love to them.

20:37.834 --> 20:39.501
[laughing]

20:39.501 --> 20:47.375
-Thank you.
-They can do it.

20:47.375 --> 20:49.000
-Don't lie.
-I don't care.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.375
Don't lie.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.125
This whole situation,
I don't care.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.417
-Whoa.
-I'm gonna go for a piss.

20:53.417 --> 20:54.626
Gabriela, do you
want a cigarette?

20:54.626 --> 20:55.792
Okay.

20:55.792 --> 20:58.584
'Cause you took so long.

20:58.584 --> 21:05.375
Take it easy, Tom,
you've had a big day.

21:05.375 --> 21:07.375
You do you and I'll do me.

21:07.375 --> 21:09.083
Can we get a couple
of beers as well?

21:09.083 --> 21:10.167
-Of course.
-Thank you.

21:10.167 --> 21:13.292
Oh [bleep] me, Ashley,
Christ.

21:13.292 --> 21:15.584
How do you feel,
like, are you happy?

21:15.584 --> 21:17.834
I think it goes from day to day.

21:17.834 --> 21:21.459
I would give Ashley direction
and she would totally disregard

21:21.459 --> 21:23.167
what I said and
go straight to you.

21:23.167 --> 21:24.667
I think she was upset
that she was third.

21:24.667 --> 21:25.834
I agree.

21:25.834 --> 21:27.167
-I have told her that...
-Okay.

21:27.167 --> 21:28.792
She has to respect your
position.

21:28.792 --> 21:31.375
Instead of the two of you
getting upset at each other,

21:31.375 --> 21:34.209
realize that it's
about all of us

21:34.209 --> 21:35.751
working on our relationship
with each other.

21:35.751 --> 21:37.584
I understand where
they're both coming from.

21:37.584 --> 21:39.375
For me, it's really difficult,

21:39.375 --> 21:41.584
because they don't behave
like this in front of me.

21:41.584 --> 21:43.792
I think the bottom line is
they don't like each other,

21:43.792 --> 21:47.334
and unfortunately, when you
don't like your coworker

21:47.334 --> 21:50.167
there's not a huge amount
you can do to move forward.

21:50.167 --> 21:52.584
I'm here to take questions
and pressures off of you.

21:52.584 --> 21:55.250
No, I promise you, you're
doing an incredible job.

21:55.250 --> 21:56.792
Can we get another two of those?

21:56.792 --> 22:03.250
Another two.

22:03.250 --> 22:04.709
So, everyone's had enough
to eat and drink?

22:04.709 --> 22:05.792
No, not to drink.

22:05.792 --> 22:06.918
What's she doing?

22:06.918 --> 22:08.501
[laughing]

22:08.501 --> 22:09.751
Let's go.
It's been a lovely evening.

22:09.751 --> 22:12.501
-[speaking Spanish]
-Muchas gracias.

22:12.501 --> 22:14.167
Oh!

22:14.167 --> 22:17.375
You can't fit through there!

22:17.375 --> 22:19.417
How's about we just
have an orgy on board?

22:19.417 --> 22:21.167
Everyone is welcome,
except for Colin,

22:21.167 --> 22:24.584
because he's got a girlfriend.

22:24.584 --> 22:26.125
Hey, hey!

22:26.125 --> 22:31.584
Parsifal III, baby!

22:31.584 --> 22:35.375
Drink, drink, drink,
hey, hey, hey!

22:35.375 --> 22:37.167
[laughs]

22:37.167 --> 22:38.167
You wanna see a magic trick?

22:38.167 --> 22:39.584
Yeah.

22:39.584 --> 22:41.792
Trick... now you see it,
now you see it even closer.

22:41.792 --> 22:43.375
What's up, mother----ers?

22:43.375 --> 22:45.626
I just ----ing
fell down the stairs.

22:45.626 --> 22:46.834
Are you okay?

22:46.834 --> 22:48.417
I'm fine, but it was hilarious.

22:48.417 --> 22:50.042
I wish someone
was there to see it.

22:50.042 --> 22:52.292
Hey, I feel like there's
so much miscommunication

22:52.292 --> 22:54.584
between the two of you,
and I feel like

22:54.584 --> 22:56.083
we're gonna do this now
because we're drunk,

22:56.083 --> 22:58.250
because that's when fun
feelings come out.

22:58.250 --> 23:00.584
I do like you, it's just...
it's just...

23:00.584 --> 23:01.709
But that's what the two of...

23:01.709 --> 23:12.125
-Wait, like who?
-No, you, you.

23:12.125 --> 23:13.292
If you were to ask me
things instead of

23:13.292 --> 23:14.792
going straight to
the chief stew,

23:14.792 --> 23:20.334
I would probably not
have an attitude.

23:20.334 --> 23:23.083
No, but when I snapped,
do you know why I was annoyed?

23:23.083 --> 23:25.167
Because when I ask you to
do things, you don't do them.

23:25.167 --> 23:28.209
We did do it.
We were doing it...

23:28.209 --> 23:29.626
Jesus ----ing Christ.

23:29.626 --> 23:33.125
Ashley has this
manipulation victim sh-- down

23:33.125 --> 23:34.626
to a ----ing science.

23:34.626 --> 23:36.751
It was one time
that I snapped her... once.

23:36.751 --> 23:37.834
Okay.
Well, I'm telling you...

23:37.834 --> 23:39.375
How far on the list did you get?

23:39.375 --> 23:41.584
I'm helping her with
the party planning.

23:41.584 --> 23:43.167
So, like, putting things away,

23:43.167 --> 23:45.042
tidying the bar, that was just,
like,

23:45.042 --> 23:46.584
totally, like,
not important at all?

23:46.584 --> 23:48.167
-Whoa, whoa, whoa...
-I was doing other stuff.

23:48.167 --> 23:49.751
-Gabriela...
-And it's still...

23:49.751 --> 23:51.459
We're still talking about it.
I apologized to her.

23:51.459 --> 23:53.292
Gabriela, you...

23:53.292 --> 23:54.876
This is not the time
to talk about it. I'm good.

23:54.876 --> 23:56.667
We should probably talk
about this when I'm sober.

23:56.667 --> 23:59.167
-No...
-I'm sorry.

23:59.167 --> 24:00.375
Whew. Anyways.

24:00.375 --> 24:02.083
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

24:02.083 --> 24:03.667
I just don't like that
I'm always the bad guy

24:03.667 --> 24:05.542
when I'm being honest with
people about their work.

24:05.542 --> 24:07.792
This is the sh-- that
I don't wanna ----ing deal with.

24:07.792 --> 24:09.709
She comes out with
a ----ing attitude.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.542
So, this is all I'm saying,
is this is the sh--

24:11.542 --> 24:14.125
that I don't wanna
----ing deal with.

24:14.125 --> 24:15.417
She's a kiss-ass.
She wants to be a second stew.

24:15.417 --> 24:16.459
No, I agree.
I thought the same thing.

24:16.459 --> 24:18.375
Come on.

24:18.375 --> 24:19.375
Do you wanna help
me get changed?

24:19.375 --> 24:20.375
-No.
-I don't...

24:20.375 --> 24:22.083
I can't...

24:22.083 --> 24:23.751
Okay, okay, okay,
we're gonna be with you.

24:23.751 --> 24:29.584
We're gonna go get changed,
and Kelsie's gonna pee.

24:29.584 --> 24:31.584
Oh, my God!

24:31.584 --> 24:36.584
Hey, hey, hey!

24:36.584 --> 24:38.167
If only my tits were bigger.

24:38.167 --> 24:39.542
Five, six, seven, eight.

24:39.542 --> 24:41.542
Come here, come here, come here.

24:41.542 --> 24:43.375
Daisy!

24:43.375 --> 24:47.417
Daisy!

24:47.417 --> 24:54.667
Yeah!

24:54.667 --> 24:56.292
I just feel embarrassed.

24:56.292 --> 24:58.501
Ashley wanted Gary
from the get-go.

24:58.501 --> 25:01.459
She just turned to me because
she wasn't getting it from Gary.

25:01.459 --> 25:05.584
[singing]

25:05.584 --> 25:07.334
It just makes me
feel like sh--.

25:07.334 --> 25:12.375
Tom!

25:12.375 --> 25:13.918
Gary?

25:13.918 --> 25:15.250
[giggles]

25:15.250 --> 25:16.501
I wanna give a massage.

25:16.501 --> 25:17.751
You do?

25:17.751 --> 25:18.918
Okay, I will let
you give me a massage.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.626
Jesus.
You've got a boyfriend.

25:21.626 --> 25:23.375
I ----ed up.

25:23.375 --> 25:27.459
I ----ed up and I'm gonna admit
I ----ed up, so...

25:27.459 --> 25:29.250
Gary and I are gonna be besties,

25:29.250 --> 25:31.626
just like he's
besties with Gabriela.

25:31.626 --> 25:35.792
Can I just say I find
it ----ing embarrassing?

25:35.792 --> 25:37.542
You're a ----ing joke.

25:37.542 --> 25:41.584
That's fine, Tom.
I really don't give a sh--.

25:41.584 --> 25:47.292
Great!

25:47.292 --> 25:48.292
Yes, Tom.

25:48.292 --> 25:49.751
I was just...

25:49.751 --> 25:52.209
Tom, I was just trying to
enjoy a good massage!

25:52.209 --> 25:56.375
Is this the biggest [bleep]
you to my sh--ty day?

25:56.375 --> 25:58.459
It's not me you're embarrassing,
it's just yourself.

25:58.459 --> 26:00.584
Oh, my God.

26:00.584 --> 26:02.792
This is really what's happening?

26:02.792 --> 26:09.167
I just feel like it was
chucked in front of my face.

26:09.167 --> 26:10.918
I don't need a chief mate
like that,

26:10.918 --> 26:13.667
and I don't need a ----ing
girl like that, either.

26:13.667 --> 26:14.667
I didn't do anything wrong!

26:14.667 --> 26:20.334
Let's go, let's go.

26:20.334 --> 26:22.375
Ah!

26:22.375 --> 26:24.542
[screaming]

26:24.542 --> 26:27.250
Say what you just said.

26:27.250 --> 26:29.375
Yeah, you did, but
I was down.

26:29.375 --> 26:30.417
No, we're not.

26:30.417 --> 26:31.584
Yeah, yeah, we are, Tom!

26:31.584 --> 26:33.083
You're a ----ing sket.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.250
If you had any
loyalty about you...

26:35.250 --> 26:45.667
-You...
-No, you haven't.

26:45.667 --> 26:47.626
You're a ----ing sket.

26:47.626 --> 26:49.375
If you had any
loyalty about you...

26:49.375 --> 26:52.375
No, you haven't.
And do you know what?

26:52.375 --> 26:54.542
You don't deserve anything
good on yourself.

26:54.542 --> 26:57.626
I've never had a drink
thrown on me,

26:57.626 --> 27:00.584
let alone have an entire ----ing
bottle poured over my head.

27:00.584 --> 27:02.375
This shows his maturity level.

27:02.375 --> 27:05.000
You're full of sh--
and that's it.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.876
Yes, you are full
of sh--.

27:08.876 --> 27:10.292
-It's your fault.
-No, it's not my fault.

27:10.292 --> 27:11.959
-Yes, it is, Ashley.
-No, Tom.

27:11.959 --> 27:13.918
-You're an absolute mess.
-No, Tom.

27:13.918 --> 27:16.167
It's not my fault you can't
keep it in your pants.

27:16.167 --> 27:17.459
We're not ----ing
doing this right now.

27:17.459 --> 27:18.834
It's not my fault you...

27:18.834 --> 27:20.667
Get the [bleep] out of my face.

27:20.667 --> 27:22.334
All you do is follow all
the fellas all night.

27:22.334 --> 27:24.501
-Hey!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:24.501 --> 27:26.918
He just threw a [bleep] bottle
of tequila on my face.

27:26.918 --> 27:28.542
-The two of you, stop it.
-This is not happening.

27:28.542 --> 27:29.542
Where are you...
where are you going?

27:29.542 --> 27:32.375
This is not happening.

27:32.375 --> 27:33.375
-What?
-What... Yeah, what?

27:33.375 --> 27:34.751
Get the [bleep] out!

27:34.751 --> 27:36.292
No, I...
Go into the...

27:36.292 --> 27:38.292
-What did I do...
-I am telling you once...

27:38.292 --> 27:39.292
When...
What did I do?

27:39.292 --> 27:40.501
Get... back up.

27:40.501 --> 27:41.501
[bleep]

27:41.501 --> 27:43.626
Back up, right now.

27:43.626 --> 27:45.209
Come with me, come with me,
come with me.

27:45.209 --> 27:46.459
Even though he's in the wrong

27:46.459 --> 27:48.167
and being inappropriate
with his words,

27:48.167 --> 27:49.542
I feel sorry for Tom

27:49.542 --> 27:51.959
because what Ashley is
doing is not very nice.

27:51.959 --> 27:54.334
You don't [bleep] someone
and two days later

27:54.334 --> 27:55.876
be all over somebody else.

27:55.876 --> 27:57.792
I don't give a [bleep]
if you're a tough guy.

27:57.792 --> 27:58.959
You treat women with respect,
that's all I'm saying.

27:58.959 --> 28:00.375
-Not her.
-Please, Tom, please.

28:00.375 --> 28:01.918
You're going way too far.

28:01.918 --> 28:03.375
I don't give a [bleep].

28:03.375 --> 28:05.584
All right, I'm going to bed.

28:05.584 --> 28:06.626
Where are you going?

28:06.626 --> 28:08.584
To bed, [bleep] you guys.

28:08.584 --> 28:13.792
Bedtime.

28:13.792 --> 28:20.918
[growls]

28:20.918 --> 28:26.167
Good night.

28:26.167 --> 28:27.918
-Hey, everyone.
-Oh, God.

28:27.918 --> 28:29.751
I am going to bed.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.334
It's my bed now.

28:31.334 --> 28:32.417
Good night.

28:32.417 --> 28:33.959
Okay, wow.

28:33.959 --> 28:35.834
----ing get into bed.

28:35.834 --> 28:36.876
I love bed.

28:36.876 --> 28:39.250
Daisy...

28:39.250 --> 28:40.626
Sure, are you wet?

28:40.626 --> 28:42.626
Get to bed.
In ----ing bed.

28:42.626 --> 28:44.292
I'm getting into bed.

28:44.292 --> 29:51.584
It's bedtime, though, guys.
Let's go to bed.

29:51.584 --> 29:53.751
How was your sleep last night?

29:53.751 --> 29:55.167
Did you sleep, or did you...

29:55.167 --> 29:56.167
We slept.

29:56.167 --> 29:58.125
No, we didn't.

29:58.125 --> 29:59.125
We didn't knock boots, if
that's what you're asking.

29:59.125 --> 30:03.250
You didn't knock...

30:03.250 --> 30:04.876
Mm, no, you can [bleep] him.

30:04.876 --> 30:07.792
[phone rings]

30:07.792 --> 30:22.375
Hola?

30:22.375 --> 30:30.250
It's ----ing embarrassing.

30:30.250 --> 30:32.375
With everything else
that's happened, I've just...

30:32.375 --> 30:36.792
I've hit my wall.

30:36.792 --> 30:39.584
Oh, Jesus Christ.

30:39.584 --> 30:41.792
I'm fine if we just
get the cabins done today.

30:41.792 --> 30:43.417
I'm gonna do the beds right now.

30:43.417 --> 30:46.250
Yeah, and then we can.
do the main saloon tomorrow

30:46.250 --> 30:50.209
Okay.

30:50.209 --> 30:51.542
What's happening?

30:51.542 --> 30:53.584
Where's my bathing suit?
Oh, there it is.

30:53.584 --> 30:55.459
Yeah, I said, if you're gonna
sleep here, you're gonna be dry,

30:55.459 --> 31:00.959
so I gave you some
of my clothes.

31:00.959 --> 31:09.959
I call it the stride of pride,
more like, yeah?

31:09.959 --> 31:12.292
Tom acted like a total hooligan.

31:12.292 --> 31:14.167
I think they're both
being crazy.

31:14.167 --> 31:15.751
I think Ashley needs
to respect Tom.

31:15.751 --> 31:16.751
Like, she did sleep with him...

31:16.751 --> 31:18.459
Yeah.

31:18.459 --> 31:19.459
And rubbing it in his face,
being all over Gary...

31:19.459 --> 31:20.667
And she...

31:20.667 --> 31:22.125
I think he was
embarrassed to admit...

31:22.125 --> 31:24.083
-And then...
-that he was jealous.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.709
I touched Gary's wee-wee last
night, okay, so that's over.

31:26.709 --> 31:28.375
Oh, God.

31:28.375 --> 31:31.918
I don't wanna know.

31:31.918 --> 31:36.292
The least amount I know,
the better.

31:36.292 --> 31:37.751
What were you all
doing last night, though?

31:37.751 --> 31:39.417
I feel like I...

31:39.417 --> 31:40.751
I was arguing with Ashley,
because she was ----ing...

31:40.751 --> 31:42.250
she was...

31:42.250 --> 31:43.459
Because she was what?

31:43.459 --> 31:45.375
Dry-humping everything
that moved.

31:45.375 --> 31:47.209
Just, like, you don't have to
do that in front of my face.

31:47.209 --> 31:49.125
But, you know, we're all single,
she can do what she wants.

31:49.125 --> 31:51.501
I was just drunk, and I got...
you know when you're drunk...

31:51.501 --> 31:52.584
Have you spoken to her today?

31:52.584 --> 32:03.626
No.

32:03.626 --> 32:05.584
I feel like when the
drinks are flowing,

32:05.584 --> 32:09.626
the emotions and problems
sometimes...

32:09.626 --> 32:11.125
-Exactly.
-...come along with it.

32:11.125 --> 32:14.709
Let's get this
----ing thing over with.

32:14.709 --> 32:16.292
Did Tom say anything to you?

32:16.292 --> 32:18.125
I haven't even seen Tom,
to be honest.

32:18.125 --> 32:19.834
I had a lookout on
the marine traffic,

32:19.834 --> 32:21.584
and I still don't understand.

32:21.584 --> 32:23.292
It's something that should
never have happened.

32:23.292 --> 32:25.292
Yeah, and the fact that he says
we think we're dragging

32:25.292 --> 32:27.584
and he didn't do anything about
it makes me worry a little bit.

32:27.584 --> 32:29.626
Yeah.

32:29.626 --> 32:31.375
Anyway, we know
everything that went wrong.

32:31.375 --> 32:40.083
We just have to think about how
we can prevent it going forward.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.792
-We need to talk.
-Where do you wanna go?

32:42.792 --> 32:49.125
On the dock.

32:49.125 --> 32:50.250
You wanna sit down?

32:50.250 --> 32:54.292
Nope, it's gonna be quick.

32:54.292 --> 32:56.375
-I'm gonna talk...
-Yeah, I'm gonna shut up.

32:56.375 --> 33:04.792
-And you're gonna listen.
-Um...

33:04.792 --> 33:06.459
-And you're gonna listen.
-Yep.

33:06.459 --> 33:07.959
I don't know what was going
through your mind

33:07.959 --> 33:10.375
when you did that,
but I've never in my life

33:10.375 --> 33:12.334
been disrespected
like that before.

33:12.334 --> 33:13.834
Whether you agree
with me or not,

33:13.834 --> 33:15.501
I did absolutely nothing
to deserve that.

33:15.501 --> 33:17.167
It's not me.

33:17.167 --> 33:18.834
I don't mean...
I didn't mean any of that.

33:18.834 --> 33:20.209
Bullsh--.

33:20.209 --> 33:21.792
I apologize.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.167
Like, I know you don't have
to accept it right now.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.792
Like, I'm not asking you
to do that.

33:24.792 --> 33:26.459
I'm absolutely mortified.

33:26.459 --> 33:28.459
-Like, that is not...
-You should be, yeah.

33:28.459 --> 33:29.667
-...----ing okay.
-You should be.

33:29.667 --> 33:31.167
That's not me.

33:31.167 --> 33:32.167
And I'm not gonna
blame it on booze.

33:32.167 --> 33:34.209
You can do whatever you like.

33:34.209 --> 33:40.334
I was just a drunk ----ing
jealous loser.

33:40.334 --> 33:41.959
I'm not proud of myself at all,

33:41.959 --> 33:44.918
but also, it took
something to pull a trigger.

33:44.918 --> 33:47.959
Like, she owes me
----ing something.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.959
I'm not gonna give you a hug,
because I'm just not...

33:50.959 --> 33:53.709
just not doing it.

33:53.709 --> 33:55.918
Daisy, Gary, and Marcos,

33:55.918 --> 33:58.709
can I get you guys
in the crew mess

33:58.709 --> 33:59.751
for a preference sheet meeting?

33:59.751 --> 34:02.501
Copy.

34:02.501 --> 34:07.542
I'm not okay.

34:07.542 --> 34:08.751
All right.

34:08.751 --> 34:10.292
Is this charter four?

34:10.292 --> 34:11.792
I believe so, number four.

34:11.792 --> 34:14.918
So, our primary charter guest
is Jim Blumenthal

34:14.918 --> 34:16.626
from Boulder, Colorado.

34:16.626 --> 34:18.959
Joining Jim is his
long-time girlfriend, Veronica;

34:18.959 --> 34:20.584
Ken and his wife, Chris.

34:20.584 --> 34:22.501
Last up are Rick and Marnie.

34:22.501 --> 34:24.584
On night one, the guests
are requesting

34:24.584 --> 34:27.250
night in Spain dinner party

34:27.250 --> 34:30.959
with traditional local dishes
from Menorca, which we just did.

34:30.959 --> 34:32.959
A green light
for me, right there.

34:32.959 --> 34:37.292
On night two, the guests request
a seafood-palooza dinner,

34:37.292 --> 34:40.334
followed by a talent show,
put on by the yacht crew.

34:40.334 --> 34:41.542
I don't have a talent.

34:41.542 --> 34:43.125
You can be a clown.

34:43.125 --> 34:44.167
I'm a clown!

34:44.167 --> 34:45.250
You think you're so funny.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.501
Can you juggle?

34:46.501 --> 34:48.250
No, mm-hmm, I can't.

34:48.250 --> 34:50.667
Can you walk and
chew gum at the same time?

34:50.667 --> 34:52.626
[laughing]

34:52.626 --> 34:54.959
I see there's something
more to Gary and Daisy

34:54.959 --> 34:56.792
than meets the eye.

34:56.792 --> 34:58.292
I don't know.
I don't know.

34:58.292 --> 35:00.584
As long as they can keep
doing their jobs.

35:00.584 --> 35:03.167
Eh, a little bit
of romance is good.

35:03.167 --> 35:05.501
Anyway, we'll figure something
out for the talent show.

35:05.501 --> 35:06.876
You guys will come up
with something.

35:06.876 --> 35:07.959
I'll do it, if you do it too.

35:07.959 --> 35:09.167
We can all do it, yeah.

35:09.167 --> 35:10.667
Ah, they look like a good group.

35:10.667 --> 35:12.250
I think it's gonna be a fun one.

35:12.250 --> 35:13.959
-We're on a roll.
-We are on a roll, yeah.

35:13.959 --> 35:15.542
I mean, except
for yesterday morning...

35:15.542 --> 35:17.250
not a very good thing.

35:17.250 --> 35:19.709
But we'll do better
on this one for sure.

35:19.709 --> 35:23.542
-Thank you.
-100%.

35:23.542 --> 35:25.834
Let's just fuel and clean
the tender,

35:25.834 --> 35:32.501
so maybe I'll take the chamois
and go clean the tender.

35:32.501 --> 35:34.792
[singing]

35:34.792 --> 35:35.792
Coming up...

35:35.792 --> 35:38.584
Yep, no worries.

35:38.584 --> 35:40.459
No, hang on just a sec,
hang on, whoa, whoa, whoa...

35:40.459 --> 35:42.167
what happened there?

35:42.167 --> 35:43.792
Dude, that... we can't get
that all wet like that.

35:43.792 --> 35:46.209
Can you grab a chamois?
Let's do this right now.

35:46.209 --> 35:49.834
Yeah, this sh-- is all
very delicate, can't get wet.

35:49.834 --> 35:51.167
[breathes deeply]

35:51.167 --> 35:53.959
[grumbles]

35:53.959 --> 35:55.334
Always be careful around that.

35:55.334 --> 35:56.626
Always make sure it's closed

35:56.626 --> 35:58.417
before you get water
anywhere near it.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.709
Tom should know better.
He's got plenty of experience.

36:00.709 --> 36:02.876
He just has to get
his head straight.

36:02.876 --> 36:07.667
This is some basic sh--.

36:07.667 --> 36:13.834
Girls, good job,
we're done for the day.

36:13.834 --> 36:15.959
Come on, Gabriela,
let's go to bed.

36:15.959 --> 36:17.709
Yesterday was a big day.

36:17.709 --> 36:20.876
Surprisingly, everyone had fun.

36:20.876 --> 36:33.167
But I was all right.

36:33.167 --> 36:35.334
So, the two of them are
pretty much fighting

36:35.334 --> 36:37.167
about who's gonna get...

36:37.167 --> 36:39.334
Oh, my God.

36:39.334 --> 36:42.542
What the [bleep] is wrong
with these people?

36:42.542 --> 36:43.959
The only person he really
wants to [bleep] is me,

36:43.959 --> 36:45.459
we all know that.

36:45.459 --> 36:47.501
Oh [bleep]!

36:47.501 --> 36:48.667
Yeah.

36:48.667 --> 36:55.792
Just give him
what he wants, then.

36:55.792 --> 37:01.292
Like, he flirts with everyone.

37:01.292 --> 37:04.584
He definitely would.

37:04.584 --> 37:07.876
[phone ringing]

37:07.876 --> 37:28.250
How are you?

37:28.250 --> 37:30.584
I'm beating myself up
over a massive mistake

37:30.584 --> 37:32.709
and overthinking everything.

37:32.709 --> 37:37.792
It feels like everything's
crashing down on me.

37:37.792 --> 37:40.792
Tom...

37:40.792 --> 37:43.250
Right, anyway, I'm going,
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

37:43.250 --> 37:46.667
Bye, I love you.
Love you. Love you, bye.

37:46.667 --> 37:48.375
Coming up...

37:48.375 --> 37:51.334
I don't wanna give him any
kind of responsibility.

37:51.334 --> 37:53.584
If I put him back on
anchor watch

37:53.584 --> 37:56.000
and it happens again,
I'm ----ed.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.417
Don't say anything to
the other crew

37:57.417 --> 37:57.417
until we have
figured a solution.

37:57.417 --> 38:10.584
You're a ----ing sket.

38:10.584 --> 38:16.334
[alarm blares]

38:16.334 --> 38:17.959
All the cabins downstairs
are done.

38:17.959 --> 38:23.918
Yes, so it's literally up
here and the provisions.

38:23.918 --> 38:27.959
All crew, provisions
are on the dock.

38:27.959 --> 38:31.417
I'm coming.

38:31.417 --> 38:33.334
[speaks Spanish]

38:33.334 --> 38:34.876
-You okay?
-Yeah.

38:34.876 --> 38:37.292
Are you?

38:37.292 --> 38:38.375
I'm okay.

38:38.375 --> 38:39.959
Do I not look okay?

38:39.959 --> 38:43.209
I think everyone's
looking a bit not okay.

38:43.209 --> 38:45.375
-Is that it?
-Yeah.

38:45.375 --> 38:47.375
Gary and Colin, can you
guys meet me down

38:47.375 --> 38:48.751
in the starboard aft cabin...

38:48.751 --> 38:50.626
Starboard aft?

38:50.626 --> 38:56.042
-Senor Glenn.
-Morning.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.751
So, I'm scrambling to try

38:57.751 --> 39:00.751
and find a solution for
the Tom problem.

39:00.751 --> 39:04.584
I mean, I like Tom, but
he ----ed up big time.

39:04.584 --> 39:07.918
I don't think it's sunk
into him how serious it was.

39:07.918 --> 39:09.542
I've tried to justify it,

39:09.542 --> 39:10.959
but I just can't find words
to justify it.

39:10.959 --> 39:13.918
Tom, I think you
need to get

39:13.918 --> 39:16.792
your emotions a little
bit under control.

39:16.792 --> 39:18.417
Yeah.

39:18.417 --> 39:19.959
I feel like you've been
all over the place.

39:19.959 --> 39:21.417
I was having the best
time of my life,

39:21.417 --> 39:23.000
and now I need to
get back to that.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.375
I'm happy to have
Tom here chamoising,

39:26.375 --> 39:30.751
but I don't wanna give him any
kind of responsibility.

39:30.751 --> 39:33.584
I'm just gonna have to show I've
come to kick it in the butt.

39:33.584 --> 39:35.375
I'm glad to hear that.

39:35.375 --> 39:37.209
At the end of the day,
if you don't feel safe

39:37.209 --> 39:44.375
with Tom on the boat...

39:44.375 --> 39:46.584
In the back of my mind, this
is what I'm looking at.

39:46.584 --> 39:49.417
If I put him back
on anchor watch

39:49.417 --> 39:54.417
and it happens again,
that happens, I'm ----ed.

39:54.417 --> 39:55.918
Don't say anything
to the other crew

39:55.918 --> 39:57.834
until we have
figured a solution,

39:57.834 --> 39:59.751
so we don't jeopardize
our season.

39:59.751 --> 40:01.167
-Cool.
-Cool, cool.

40:01.167 --> 40:02.667
-Thank you.
-Make it work.

40:02.667 --> 40:09.918
-Yep.
-Let's make it work, exactly.

40:09.918 --> 40:11.709
I need to know what we can do

40:11.709 --> 40:14.375
so this isn't weird, because
I can't deal with this.

40:14.375 --> 40:17.751
I just wanna ask you to
trust me a little bit more,

40:17.751 --> 40:18.959
because I really do
like you, Ashley.

40:18.959 --> 40:27.709
No, I...

40:27.709 --> 40:29.292
-Really?
-Yes!

40:29.292 --> 40:32.167
That's ----ing weird.

40:32.167 --> 40:35.459
I can understand why you get
thrown off by my moods,

40:35.459 --> 40:39.292
and if I have them, it's because
when I ask you to do something,

40:39.292 --> 40:40.918
you don't do it,

40:40.918 --> 40:42.667
and then
you ask Daisy questions,

40:42.667 --> 40:44.334
and that makes me feel like
you don't respect me.

40:44.334 --> 40:46.375
I'm gonna work on that.

40:46.375 --> 40:48.459
And I'll work on it too, because
I want you to come to me.

40:48.459 --> 40:49.876
I just... I...

40:49.876 --> 40:51.751
I don't have very many
girlfriends.

40:51.751 --> 40:53.000
I have, like, one or two.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.375
-Okay.
-I don't... it's hard...

40:55.375 --> 40:56.584
Well, I'm gonna put
myself on that list.

40:56.584 --> 40:57.959
It's hard for me.

40:57.959 --> 41:00.792
I'm happy to pretend
that everything is great

41:00.792 --> 41:04.626
and whatever, but honestly,
I don't trust Gabriela.

41:04.626 --> 41:06.459
-It's fine, Ashley.
-It's hard for me.

41:06.459 --> 41:07.501
You can feel what you want,
but when we're working...

41:07.501 --> 41:08.959
No, I know.

41:08.959 --> 41:09.959
I want us to work
well together, that's it.

41:09.959 --> 41:11.501
Yeah.

41:11.501 --> 41:12.959
We don't have to be
best friends,

41:12.959 --> 41:14.959
especially if you don't
feel comfortable with me.

41:14.959 --> 41:18.501
All crew, all crew, the guests
are gonna be here in 10 minutes.

41:18.501 --> 41:20.375
Let's get everybody suited up.

41:20.375 --> 41:21.959
Okay, Gabriela, let's finish up.

41:21.959 --> 41:29.375
All right.

41:29.375 --> 41:32.542
Come on in.

41:32.542 --> 41:35.292
I need to speak to you at
some point about ultimately,

41:35.292 --> 41:36.709
I wanna prove to you
on this charter...

41:36.709 --> 41:38.209
-Uh-huh.
-That I should stay.

41:38.209 --> 41:39.584
I can't...

41:39.584 --> 41:40.959
Okay, we'll talk about
it a bit more,

41:40.959 --> 41:42.667
but there's
other stuff going on,

41:42.667 --> 41:44.792
so I've gotta figure
it all out.

41:44.792 --> 41:47.334
But we will talk
about it a bit more.

41:47.334 --> 41:49.792
It's never good when someone
says, "We'll chat later."

41:49.792 --> 41:52.334
I don't think you'll be on
anchor watch for the time being.

41:52.334 --> 41:55.792
I need people that
I can trust, whatever it is.

41:55.792 --> 41:57.000
-Yeah.
-You know what I mean?

41:57.000 --> 41:58.584
Yeah, I got you.

41:58.584 --> 42:01.375
So, but anyway,
we'll talk more about it.

42:01.375 --> 42:05.375
I picked myself right up and
I was ready to smash it,

42:05.375 --> 42:09.209
and then telling your boss what
you think he'd wanna hear,

42:09.209 --> 42:11.584
and you don't see
that look on his face

42:11.584 --> 42:12.792
that he's happy about it.

42:12.792 --> 42:14.292
We don't need to talk later.

42:14.292 --> 42:20.542
I know exactly
what he's thinking.

42:20.542 --> 42:21.876
Next on "Below Deck
Sailing Yacht"...

42:21.876 --> 42:22.918
-Hello.
-I'm Jim.

42:22.918 --> 42:24.375
Nice to meet you.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.959
You guys are having
a talent show.

42:25.959 --> 42:27.918
We are a pretty
talentless bunch.

42:27.918 --> 42:30.834
-Yay!
-Oh, my God!

42:30.834 --> 42:32.542
Ah!

42:32.542 --> 42:34.250
Daisy's doing wine
and everyone's seated.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.792
All this food,
I can't cook it in advance.

42:36.792 --> 42:38.375
Ready whenever you are.

42:38.375 --> 42:39.709
When you told me that?

42:39.709 --> 42:40.792
I thought Gabriela
came down and told you.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.417
Are you serious right now?

42:42.417 --> 42:44.375
What the [bleep], Gabby?

42:44.375 --> 42:45.792
Where's our food?

42:45.792 --> 42:47.334
We're drunk...
it's drunk Colin.

42:47.334 --> 42:49.834
If I were Tom, I would
be working my ass off.

42:49.834 --> 42:51.918
Can you go have
a look at the port side?

42:51.918 --> 42:54.709
Do something, prove your value.

42:54.709 --> 42:56.375
Tom, come on down here.

42:56.375 --> 42:57.959
What is the point
of keeping someone

42:57.959 --> 43:01.959
who's just taking up space?
