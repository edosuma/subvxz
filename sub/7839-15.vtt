01:10.047 --> 01:12.604
I am so stoked about Lenny's party.

01:12.666 --> 01:14.658
He said he's gonna make a 
surprise announcement.

01:14.692 --> 01:16.908
Maybe he's getting married.

01:17.681 --> 01:19.310
Why the hell would he want to do that....

01:19.488 --> 01:22.697
blessed sacrament that has made my life so rich?

01:23.126 --> 01:24.514
I like your hat, sweetie.

01:24.550 --> 01:25.939
I'm not wearing a hat.

01:25.988 --> 01:27.482
I mean, the one at the house.

01:30.993 --> 01:33.342
Another party and we cain't go.

01:33.415 --> 01:37.226
Yeah. Just 'cause we's afraid 
of using the uppity box.

01:38.990 --> 01:40.212
Hey, Ned.

01:40.280 --> 01:43.713
Ain't no party like a Lenny party 
'cause a Lenny party don't stop.

01:44.593 --> 01:45.937
I got to work tomorrow.

01:46.013 --> 01:46.338
I better go.

01:48.697 --> 01:54.895
My god. How did Lenny get to be 
newsfake magazine's man of the year?

01:54.992 --> 01:57.594
That's just a souvenir from an amusement park.

01:57.882 --> 01:58.497
What?

01:58.570 --> 02:01.055
Next you'll be telling me he 
didn't meet Woody Woodpecker.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.472
I dated the woman in that suit 
for three months.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.992
Then she left me for the guy who 
cleans the vomit off the roller coasters.

02:08.235 --> 02:11.107
Hey, Lenny, I see you cut 
the celery at an angle here.

02:11.174 --> 02:14.023
Makes my straight-cut celery look like crap.

02:16.350 --> 02:17.856
Attention, everybody!

02:17.917 --> 02:18.999
Please shut up!

02:19.950 --> 02:22.211
I know you're all wondering why you're here.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.451
The fact is, I'm dying...

02:25.060 --> 02:27.257
...to tell you that I have adopted...

02:27.959 --> 02:29.114
...a new faith...

02:29.879 --> 02:33.530
...in the power of technological 
advances to make me happy.

02:33.567 --> 02:37.560
That's right, I've got a new plasma screen HDTV!

02:39.585 --> 02:43.261
I've never seen a picture so highly defined!

02:43.458 --> 02:46.102
Lenny, this tv is amazing.

02:46.187 --> 02:50.413
If you're not careful, I might just spend 
the rest of my life on your couch.

02:51.574 --> 02:53.245
You don't mean that literally, of course.

02:53.516 --> 02:54.878
You're right, Lenny. I...

03:19.187 --> 03:22.040
Lenny, bring me a beer and 
your deepest chamber pot.

03:22.162 --> 03:22.628
Chop-chop.

03:25.962 --> 03:28.742
Look at that picture quality.

03:28.951 --> 03:32.415
You can see the soulless emptiness 
in that shark's eyes.

03:33.192 --> 03:35.409
Two and a half men.

03:35.865 --> 03:39.998
You can see the soulless emptiness 
in Charlie Sheen's eyes.

03:41.229 --> 03:42.741
Dad, please come home.

03:42.852 --> 03:43.963
We miss you.

03:44.601 --> 03:46.649
Is that a high-def tv?!

03:46.774 --> 03:48.895
Mom didn't say anything about high-def!

03:51.388 --> 03:53.429
Later, if I have enough energy, we can walk

03:53.454 --> 03:56.273
up to the tv and I'll show you how thin it is.

03:56.729 --> 03:59.355
Wow, there's a rainbow outside.

03:59.567 --> 04:00.108
Oh, yeah?

04:00.182 --> 04:03.671
Well, right there's a commercial 
with a dancing cold sore.

04:04.028 --> 04:05.290
Break out!

04:05.836 --> 04:07.346
Ha-ha! Hoo-hoo! Ha-ha!

04:08.294 --> 04:09.184
Break out!

04:09.817 --> 04:11.713
Ha-ha! Hoo-hoo! Ha-ha!

04:11.936 --> 04:12.847
Ha! Hoo-hoo!

04:13.094 --> 04:14.186
He-he-ha! Ha-ha!

04:19.188 --> 04:22.401
And bodell jenks the third 
crashes into bodell jenks!

04:22.835 --> 04:25.331
The winner is Bodell Jenks, junior!

04:27.573 --> 04:30.407
wow, I can actually feel the heat.

04:30.448 --> 04:32.712
Beat it. This is my alone time.

04:33.386 --> 04:35.675
Can you at least take a picture 
of me with the tv?

04:35.723 --> 04:37.510
I ain't fallin' for that again.

04:37.763 --> 04:39.851
Yeah. Good times.

04:41.579 --> 04:43.731
Stupid non-plasma tv.

04:43.821 --> 04:45.256
Picture so blurry.

04:45.318 --> 04:47.162
Might as well rub dirt in my eyes.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.839
Homie, I've been thinking.

04:48.938 --> 04:51.699
We have been using this tv for a long time,

04:51.999 --> 04:56.649
so I entered a contest where the 
first prize is a plasma screen tv.

04:57.349 --> 04:59.270
Marge! I love you! I love you!

04:59.319 --> 05:00.134
I love you!

05:04.363 --> 05:06.926
Now i really hope we win that contest.

05:06.957 --> 05:08.326
There's a chance we won't win?!

05:16.166 --> 05:18.215
My collection is complete.

05:18.319 --> 05:21.168
40 years of the family circus.

05:28.359 --> 05:29.060
Y'ello.

05:29.075 --> 05:30.688
Congratulations, Mr. Simpson.

05:30.759 --> 05:31.407
You've won.

05:31.484 --> 05:32.787
The big screen tv?

05:32.849 --> 05:34.484
No. No one wins that.

05:34.558 --> 05:38.644
You won third prize,  a tour of the FOX 
network in los angeles, california.

05:38.708 --> 05:40.164
All expenses paid?

05:40.426 --> 05:42.113
Look, I gotta go.

05:51.190 --> 05:54.410
Here's where we make the best 
damn sports show, period.

05:54.486 --> 05:58.295
And there's where we make "the worst 
damn comedy show, period."

06:01.106 --> 06:01.967
why look.

06:01.991 --> 06:04.959
There's Dan Castellaneta 
from the Tracey Ullman show.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.329
Hey, funny man!

06:06.578 --> 06:08.477
Say something funny!

06:08.766 --> 06:11.065
Please don't lean out of the tram, sir.

06:11.114 --> 06:11.791
You might get hurt.

06:11.815 --> 06:13.733
Don't lean out of the tram...

06:15.978 --> 06:18.550
Here's where we develop our many reality shows.

06:18.671 --> 06:19.937
There's dwarf or midget:

06:19.974 --> 06:23.144
America decides, and million dollar fart-off.

06:25.067 --> 06:26.235
Mother Flippers?

06:26.284 --> 06:27.556
What's this show about?

06:27.575 --> 06:30.834
This is a reality program, dear, 
where we take wives from

06:30.870 --> 06:34.018
two very different families and 
they trade places for a month.

06:34.111 --> 06:36.820
I already saw that exact same 
show on another network.

06:37.494 --> 06:39.990
Here, sweetie, have a FOX sweatshirt.

06:41.475 --> 06:43.236
This  is an abc sweatshirt.

06:43.274 --> 06:45.074
Yeah, and it zips all the way up.

06:54.381 --> 06:55.086
Spray 'em down!

06:56.881 --> 06:59.180
So, what's the prize on this wife swap show?

06:59.242 --> 07:02.272
About enough to buy a new plasma tv.

07:02.678 --> 07:05.104
That's just the product I've been coveting!

07:05.165 --> 07:06.150
Pick  us! Pick us!

07:06.268 --> 07:07.272
Not so fast.

07:07.300 --> 07:10.251
Are you sure you want your most 
intimate moments broadcast across the

07:10.288 --> 07:10.804
country?

07:10.868 --> 07:11.717
Are you kidding?

07:11.778 --> 07:13.057
Take a look at my dvd.

07:14.084 --> 07:16.788
They'll never let me  near lake havasu again.

07:17.327 --> 07:18.716
What are you doing, Homer?

07:18.863 --> 07:22.717
I'm signing us up for a reality show 
where we trade you to another family.

07:22.861 --> 07:25.418
Well, that might be interesting.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.271
Or it could damage many, many lives.

07:28.369 --> 07:30.714
Marge, you're the greatest mom ever.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.895
I want the whole world to see that.

07:32.939 --> 07:34.867
That's very sweet, but I...

07:34.919 --> 07:36.345
Look, ma'am, I've done a lot of these.

07:36.382 --> 07:38.521
Everybody has fun, no one gets hurt

07:38.634 --> 07:40.545
and you make a lot of money 
you could really use.

07:40.623 --> 07:43.090
And if you say yes now, it'll 
make a great act break.

07:45.626 --> 07:46.554
I'll do it!

07:46.690 --> 07:48.213
Perfect. But could you say it again

07:48.328 --> 07:49.934
with more emphasis on the "I'll"?

07:50.141 --> 07:51.216
I'll do it.

07:51.301 --> 07:53.033
No, no, go back to the first way.

07:53.277 --> 07:54.268
I'll do it.

07:54.533 --> 07:55.868
Wait, I wasn't happy with that.

07:56.037 --> 07:57.998
You know what, just do it the way 
it feels comfortable to you.

07:58.185 --> 08:01.492
I'll do it. I'll do it!

08:01.751 --> 08:05.570
I'll do it. I'll do it.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.701
I'll... do... it.

08:07.876 --> 08:08.638
How was that?

08:09.018 --> 08:10.312
We'll get it later.

08:13.108 --> 08:14.893
Verity, who will be your new mom,

08:15.104 --> 08:17.417
is the youngest-ever full professor at yale.

08:17.574 --> 08:20.005
I got my tenure at 28.

08:20.117 --> 08:21.129
Oh, really?

08:21.301 --> 08:24.359
Bart, when did you get your tenure?

08:24.430 --> 08:26.342
I got my tenure right here.

08:26.430 --> 08:29.383
Yeah, well I have full tenure.

08:32.082 --> 08:33.647
We better pixelate those.

08:33.702 --> 08:35.506
There aren't enough pixels in the world!

08:35.758 --> 08:39.232
Yeah, just cover it with Ryan seacrest's head.

08:39.486 --> 08:40.696
This is Charles.

08:40.759 --> 08:42.042
You can call me Charlie.

08:42.169 --> 08:44.842
But do not call me late when 
there are scones about.

08:46.819 --> 08:47.863
It's a little british humor.

08:48.922 --> 08:51.500
I'll bet the twist is he's gay.

08:51.685 --> 08:54.273
Your two families will exchange 
wives for a month,

08:54.403 --> 08:58.233
then a viewer vote will decide who 
they think is the least reprehensible.

08:58.689 --> 09:00.140
I don't understand, dad.

09:00.393 --> 09:02.292
Our family has so many flaws.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.386
Why must we share them with the world?

09:04.471 --> 09:09.845
Because we'll be on tv, and earn 
enough money to buy a tv.

09:10.459 --> 09:11.492
Tv.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.396
But dad...

09:12.440 --> 09:13.629
yes, tv-sa?

09:14.633 --> 09:15.364
Forget it.

09:16.623 --> 09:17.896
Listen up, stonehenge.

09:17.995 --> 09:21.496
I made a drawing of the places 
on Marge you can't touch.

09:21.951 --> 09:23.088
Especially the hair.

09:23.258 --> 09:24.542
Oh, you needn't worry.

09:24.655 --> 09:26.752
I'm a bit of an elbow man, myself, actually.

09:27.546 --> 09:29.009
A bit different, a bit weird.

09:29.524 --> 09:30.160
Not sexual.

09:30.917 --> 09:33.276
You take forever to say nothing.

09:35.113 --> 09:37.346
You know, you don't seem like the money-hungry

09:37.399 --> 09:39.726
semi-stripper who's usually on FOX.

09:39.816 --> 09:40.474
Why'd you do it?

09:40.553 --> 09:42.358
Well, I thought there was no further way

09:42.399 --> 09:46.552
I could humiliate my husband, 
and then this opportunity came along.

09:47.415 --> 09:48.343
I see.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.915
Well, I should be getting to the living room.

09:51.146 --> 09:53.651
You know, I despise my husband.

09:53.688 --> 09:56.620
Well, he didn't get the prize 
pig at the fair, either.

09:56.687 --> 09:59.056
Charles hasn't satisfied me in years.

09:59.135 --> 10:01.420
Yeah, that's how I feel about Notre Dame football.

10:01.564 --> 10:04.173
Cruel, dusty years.

10:05.020 --> 10:06.815
I don't know why I ever married that woman.

10:11.782 --> 10:14.213
So, Charles, what do you do for a living?

10:14.328 --> 10:17.146
Well, I'm an office manager, and, no,

10:17.324 --> 10:19.723
I didn't even get a promotion today, again.

10:19.857 --> 10:21.119
So, go on, go ahead.

10:21.164 --> 10:23.679
Disembowel me with your pointy, pointy words.

10:23.754 --> 10:27.219
Really? You manage a whole office?

10:28.347 --> 10:28.900
Yes.

10:29.722 --> 10:32.174
Yes. Yes I do, actually.

10:32.394 --> 10:34.450
Well, that's very impressive.

10:34.576 --> 10:37.352
Does that include the people and the furniture?

10:37.480 --> 10:40.569
Yeah, and I decide where the christmas party's held.

10:40.756 --> 10:42.603
Actually, it's decided by committee, but, you know,

10:42.791 --> 10:43.719
I  choose the committee.

10:43.799 --> 10:44.342
Hello.

10:47.825 --> 10:50.590
I don't, I don't choose  the committee as such,

10:50.664 --> 10:52.928
but, you know, I choose where they meet.

10:53.302 --> 10:56.109
This year I am thinking of conference room "C."

10:57.572 --> 11:00.243
That leaves "a" and "b" available for overflow.

11:00.372 --> 11:01.708
Well  done!

11:09.502 --> 11:12.935
Bart, I told you no television
till you do the dishes.

11:13.012 --> 11:15.443
And I do not call that doing the dishes.

11:19.468 --> 11:23.204
well, my mom says why bother 
punishing me, I never learn.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.880
Disgusting.

11:31.281 --> 11:35.319
Young man, I'm going to turn 
that cartoon into homework!

11:35.404 --> 11:36.301
Help me, cameraman.

11:36.367 --> 11:38.193
I let you smoke a cigarette in my bedroom.

11:38.234 --> 11:39.038
That was a joint.

11:39.119 --> 11:40.580
And I have a name. It's Doug.

11:40.864 --> 11:43.035
"Then itchy used an ice cream scoop

11:43.094 --> 11:45.536
"to scoop out scratchy's heart 
and make it a sundae.

11:45.760 --> 11:46.240
The end."

11:46.631 --> 11:51.442
Now, Homer, would you care to 
give your report on CSI: Miami?

11:55.034 --> 11:56.474
"there's this guy that got killed.

11:56.531 --> 11:57.995
"I think it was in Miami.

11:58.126 --> 12:00.672
"So CSI: Miami investigated-ed it.

12:00.923 --> 12:03.527
"Then a family said how much 
they loved the olive garden.

12:03.792 --> 12:04.835
"Then I fell asleep.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.503
When I woke up, Letterman was talking to Alias."

12:14.249 --> 12:16.253
That's wonderful.

12:16.568 --> 12:17.288
Indeed.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.304
Now, if you'll excuse me, 
I have a mandarin chinese lesson.

12:20.423 --> 12:21.310
Xie xie.

12:21.504 --> 12:22.161
Zai jian.

12:24.062 --> 12:26.410
He's a very impressive boy.

12:26.610 --> 12:28.245
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

12:28.475 --> 12:31.324
A tree that's been alone for far too long.

12:31.540 --> 12:32.375
I don't get it.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.580
Are you saying you're the tree?

12:34.776 --> 12:35.350
Maybe.

12:35.685 --> 12:36.593
Are my roots showing?

12:37.418 --> 12:38.649
Wordplay, brilliant.

12:39.122 --> 12:39.999
Would you like to hear a joke?

12:40.092 --> 12:42.012
As long as it's not a knock-knock joke.

12:42.186 --> 12:44.481
I always ruin them by saying, "come in."

12:44.587 --> 12:47.321
No, no. This joke is actually quite funny.

12:47.856 --> 12:50.777
You see, this man, he finds a magic lamp,

12:50.952 --> 12:52.236
and a genie comes out.

12:52.340 --> 12:53.300
That's funny.

12:53.394 --> 12:54.166
That's just the setup.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.880
Well, you've set me up, for laughs down the road.

12:56.900 --> 13:00.060
So the genie says, "I'll give you three wishes,

13:00.200 --> 13:03.140
"but whatever you get, your wife gets double."

13:03.350 --> 13:04.490
Okay? Remember that.

13:05.050 --> 13:06.110
How nice for her.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.520
Now, here's the humor.

13:07.710 --> 13:09.800
The man says, "I want a new car.

13:10.340 --> 13:12.600
The genie says, "your wife gets two."

13:12.820 --> 13:14.020
Okay, remember the double?

13:15.020 --> 13:17.370
The man says, "I want a new house."

13:17.470 --> 13:19.790
So the genie says, "your wife gets two."

13:21.410 --> 13:22.670
So the man says...

13:23.930 --> 13:25.350
"beat me half to death."

13:27.440 --> 13:27.870
It's funny.

13:27.870 --> 13:28.430
Don't you get it?

13:28.590 --> 13:30.140
'Cause she gets double, so if he gets beaten

13:30.140 --> 13:33.670
half to death, the wife would be beaten to death.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.320
That sounds horrible.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.430
I agree, terrible.

13:37.530 --> 13:39.700
Offensive  towards women.

13:40.530 --> 13:41.570
Little amusing, don't you think?

13:41.650 --> 13:42.430
No!

13:42.500 --> 13:43.070
Me, either.

13:43.140 --> 13:44.270
Spousal abuse.

13:44.410 --> 13:45.110
It's, uh, it's a real problem.

13:45.110 --> 13:45.680
It's not funny.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.790
It's tragic, if anything so...

13:46.860 --> 13:49.130
well, I liked the genie part. That was fun.

13:49.270 --> 13:49.790
You think so?

13:49.820 --> 13:51.900
Yes, I could really picture him.

13:51.940 --> 13:54.990
With curly shoes and smoke all over the place.

13:55.140 --> 13:57.220
You're a born storyteller.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.570
Well, yeah, I suppose I am, yeah.

14:00.780 --> 14:01.570
Yeah, not a murderer.

14:01.870 --> 14:02.410
No.

14:03.980 --> 14:04.950
Would you like to hear another joke?

14:05.010 --> 14:06.500
I sure would.

14:06.630 --> 14:08.300
Let me just get us some iced tea.

14:10.130 --> 14:13.840
One more kind word from her 
and I am completely smitten.

14:14.110 --> 14:16.800
Your toaster takes bagels.

14:16.920 --> 14:17.810
How ritzy.

14:18.340 --> 14:19.680
And there we have it.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.290
what's that delicious smell?

14:27.370 --> 14:29.550
I'm burning all your underwear.

14:34.180 --> 14:35.500
what's with the kimono?

14:35.760 --> 14:37.190
"Are we having Lachoy?" 

14:37.820 --> 14:38.680
No Marge,

14:38.980 --> 14:42.340
I was just sitting around drinking Vermouth

14:42.340 --> 14:44.480
and contemplating how, just when you're drowning

14:44.550 --> 14:47.840
in a pit of despair, life can throw 
you a beautiful blue life preserver.

14:48.710 --> 14:51.230
I thought life preservers only came in orange.

14:51.340 --> 14:54.610
Because wouldn't it be hard
to see blue in the ocean?

14:54.650 --> 14:55.530
Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa.

14:55.730 --> 14:57.530
No logic. Not tonight.

14:57.870 --> 14:58.640
Where's Ben?

14:58.860 --> 15:00.980
The housekeeper took him out for a walk.

15:03.180 --> 15:05.530
How long do we have to stay here?

15:05.630 --> 15:07.870
Till I'm sick of drinking these,

15:08.160 --> 15:10.480
and I'm never sick of drinkin' these.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.930
That's right, it just gets worse.

15:20.990 --> 15:23.450
So, you see, we have the
whole house to ourselves.

15:24.890 --> 15:26.450
Oh, who left this here?

15:28.200 --> 15:29.630
Did I tell you I'm a bit of a songwriter?

15:30.030 --> 15:32.200
Words and music, hold the applause.

15:32.540 --> 15:33.870
I wrote this song for a woman.

15:34.490 --> 15:34.910
You.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.660
What an odd thing for a man who's 
not interested in me to do.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.310
Yes. Not interested.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.000
Let me just breathe your scent 
for a moment before I play.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.650
Lady when you came to me,  

15:57.010 --> 15:58.790
I was feeling blue

15:59.950 --> 16:02.480
blue just like your hair, you see 

16:02.910 --> 16:04.770
blue just like the moon 

16:05.740 --> 16:10.500
but only when the moon is blue 
and not when it is cream 

16:11.670 --> 16:16.560
and now that you are here 
with me I am in a dream oh, 

16:17.120 --> 16:19.570
Yeah, Marge, your dreams can come true.

16:22.020 --> 16:27.000
Lady, when you go away I feel like I could die

16:27.890 --> 16:30.410
not like dye like your hair is dyed

16:30.630 --> 16:34.560
but die like Lady Di and not Like Di

16:34.560 --> 16:38.880
like her name is Di  but die like when she died.

16:43.610 --> 16:48.730
But lady just like lady di be my princess tonight

16:48.730 --> 16:51.660
but don't die don't die.

16:51.900 --> 16:52.880
No way.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.930
That song was very nice.

16:55.100 --> 16:57.050
How'd you think up so many rhyming words?

16:57.140 --> 16:58.300
Marge, I love you.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.790
And I can tell from your basic level of courtesy 

17:00.840 --> 17:01.950
that you love me, too.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.450
What?! No.

17:03.860 --> 17:06.920
Listen, Charles, I don't want 
to hurt your feelings...

17:06.980 --> 17:08.280
because you love me, right?

17:08.410 --> 17:10.660
Admit it. We were born to fall into 

17:10.660 --> 17:11.900
each others' arms on reality tv.

17:11.910 --> 17:14.410
I'm  sorry, but I love Homer.

17:15.589 --> 17:16.760
Of course you do.

17:17.530 --> 17:19.190
He's a real man, not like me,

17:19.520 --> 17:22.119
a miserable toad under the thumb 
of the biggest bitch this side

17:22.119 --> 17:23.910
of the Westminster Kennel Club.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.839
Charles, please, your son might see this.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.240
He's not my son.

17:28.369 --> 17:29.940
His real father is either the pool man 

17:29.940 --> 17:31.030
or my wife's lover.

17:32.390 --> 17:35.040
They're the main two candidates 
I've narrowed it down to.

17:35.070 --> 17:35.690
Pretty sure.

17:36.770 --> 17:37.830
There, there.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.590
God, I miss Homer.

17:39.960 --> 17:40.900
I miss him, too.

17:41.220 --> 17:43.830
What is it about him that 
is so damned irresistible?

17:44.100 --> 17:44.810
Well...

17:44.990 --> 17:48.620
he's loved me ever since the 
first moment he saw me, 

17:48.670 --> 17:49.930
and he's never stopped.

17:50.180 --> 17:52.110
And whatever it takes to make me happy,

17:52.110 --> 17:54.250
he'll do it even if it kills him.

17:55.160 --> 17:58.220
Sorry, I ran out of tape just 
before that beautiful speech of hers.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.770
But I got a great shot of him 
saying his son's a bastard.

18:02.900 --> 18:06.210
Lisa, que fais tu dans cet Etat?

18:06.620 --> 18:08.400
La Fox m'a envoyée ici pour 
venir te chercher.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.350
J'ai eu le droit de prendre 
FreedoLance Air Force Yum.

18:11.710 --> 18:12.840
Et je suis contrainte de dire,

18:13.080 --> 18:16.290
'Rejoins moi dans le ranch 
des saveurs Robben, HiHa!'

18:16.570 --> 18:17.920
Rentrons a la maison chérie.

18:18.010 --> 18:20.690
Je suis sure que ton père nous attends.

18:20.820 --> 18:23.940
Et je viens avec vous pour 
dire à ma sorcière de femme :

18:24.150 --> 18:25.040
'tu es virée'.

18:28.420 --> 18:30.640
J'imitais Donald Trump, dans 'Le milliardaire'.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.400
Si vous saviez de qui je parle, 
vous seriez mortes de rire.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.870
Je sais qui est Donald Trump.

18:36.070 --> 18:36.730
Moi aussi.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.150
Je ne pense pas.

18:38.660 --> 18:39.280
Bande d'abrutis.

18:44.170 --> 18:45.440
Je ne la vois nul part.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.180
Il est temps pour Homer de redevenir Homer.

18:53.780 --> 18:56.770
Homer, tu m'as tellement manqué.

18:58.510 --> 19:00.260
Remets ton pantalon.

19:00.620 --> 19:02.250
Oh Marge, merci mon Dieu, tu es de retour.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.040
Elle m'a fait passer du temps avec les enfants.

19:05.480 --> 19:08.400
Et le temps pour la télévision 
est devenu un temps de dialogue.

19:08.450 --> 19:09.600
Où est elle?

19:09.680 --> 19:12.140
Où est cette suceuse d'âme?

19:13.810 --> 19:14.240
Magie?

19:14.370 --> 19:15.140
Dans son berceau.

19:15.260 --> 19:18.090
Non, je parle de ma future ex femme.

19:18.210 --> 19:21.840
Je... Je ne suis pas sur que vous 
vouliez la voir,là maintenant.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.120
Oh que si.

19:24.170 --> 19:26.240
Elle va avoir le choc de sa vie.

19:26.430 --> 19:27.890
Charles, je te quitte.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.590
Tu roupilles, tu perds.

19:30.380 --> 19:32.070
Tu me quittes pour lui.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.560
C'est ce que l'on pourrait penser.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.560
Mais le cousin Ed' est né femme.

19:35.810 --> 19:38.900
Ce qui nous a rapproché, c'est notrehaine pour toi.

19:39.030 --> 19:41.570
Et bien je vais voter 'NON' à ce 38ème amandement,

19:41.570 --> 19:43.010
et vous ne pourrez pas adopter.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.430
Je plaisante. Je plaisante.

19:45.580 --> 19:47.560
Je ne vote pas. Le bureau de vote est en haut

19:47.560 --> 19:48.730
de la colline, et je n'y arrive jamais.

19:54.060 --> 19:57.230
Tu me fais rire, tu me fais pleurer.

19:57.470 --> 20:00.280
Sans toi je voudrais simplement mourir.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.750
Pour le reste de ma vie, tu seras une révélation.

20:03.860 --> 20:09.220
Laisse moi donc admirer ton image.

20:09.620 --> 20:11.480
Et Marge, tu assures aussi.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.880
Ouais, si tu veux.
