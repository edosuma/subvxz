How could I throw away something
that means so much?

17:21.416 --> 17:24.533
I still remember seeing you wear this
in high school.

17:25.628 --> 17:28.415
I couldn't get within ﬁve feet of you
without falling over.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.498
Even after your ship
got rid of the kryptonite...

17:31.676 --> 17:34.383
...there always seemed to be
something standing in our way.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.175
Not anymore.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.473
We're together now, Lana.

17:41.644 --> 17:44.636
I'm not gonna let anyone
take that away from us.

17:45.481 --> 17:50.100
Clark, I talked to Dr. Groll
about what happened with the kryptonite.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.609
It wasn't the chip.

17:55.158 --> 17:56.648
It was me.

17:59.704 --> 18:02.366
So besides strength and speed,
you can destroy kryptonite?

18:02.540 --> 18:05.498
No. Dr. Groll says I absorbed it.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.283
But I'm worried, Clark.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.077
If Lex built this as a weapon...

18:10.465 --> 18:12.797
...what if you were the target?

18:13.676 --> 18:16.588
But Lex isn't wearing it, Lana, you are.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.719
Look, we're gonna ﬁgure this out.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.427
We need to stay focused
on tracking down this bomber...

18:21.601 --> 18:24.013
...before he causes any more damage.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.682
Did you ﬁnd anything?

18:27.148 --> 18:28.684
Yeah.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.605
You were right.
Oliver was hiding something.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.772
He thinks the bomber is someone
who used to work for him.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.484
I went to that address listed there,
but he doesn't live there anymore.

18:42.330 --> 18:46.539
According to this,
Mr. Schott is a pretty proliﬁc inventor.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.792
He ﬁled a lot of patents
for S.T.A.R. Labs.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.834
A guy like this, he wouldn't just stop
registering his research...

18:54.008 --> 18:55.509
...because Oliver let him go.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.463
So maybe the patent ofﬁce
has a current address for him.

18:59.055 --> 19:02.968
If this guy's working for Lex, we're dealing
with a lot more than just some toymaker.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.384
If Lex put things in motion,
he has planned three moves ahead.

19:07.855 --> 19:12.519
And now that he has nothing to lose,
he's more dangerous than ever.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.703
What the hell?

19:29.877 --> 19:33.540
How does it feel to not be in control
for once?

you should take your toys and go home.
