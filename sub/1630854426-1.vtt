00:24.400 --> 00:26.480
- We are going to miss it.
- What?

00:26.560 --> 00:28.320
- The sunset!
- Put your foot down!

00:28.400 --> 00:29.640
Have you seen these roads?

00:29.720 --> 00:31.960
On the website
there is a couple sitting in a hot tub,

00:32.040 --> 00:34.040
drinking champagne, watching the sunset.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.840
That's us. That's what we paid for.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.720
- What if we die?
- Look around you.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.200
- I'm watching the fucking…
- Can you honestly,

00:39.280 --> 00:41.480
seriously think of a better way to go?

00:41.560 --> 00:43.080
If we go over that cliff,

00:43.160 --> 00:45.280
roll eight hundred feet
and burst into flames,

00:45.360 --> 00:47.200
we'd be the coolest people we know!

00:48.800 --> 00:49.720
Okay, hang on!

01:00.280 --> 01:01.360
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.680
We made it. Okay.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.400
- Oh. Which one is it?
- I don't know.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.280
I can't remember if it's the blue cabin
or the one that isn't blue.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.560
Oh, shit! I've got no signal.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.720
- I think that's the one.
- Quick, go, but be careful!

01:12.800 --> 01:14.680
Yes. Whoo! Beautiful.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.200
No. No time!

01:16.280 --> 01:17.560
What are you doing?

01:17.680 --> 01:19.400
There's no time!

01:19.480 --> 01:20.440
Get in!

01:20.520 --> 01:22.520
- I can't get in.
- Get in the hot tub!

01:25.840 --> 01:27.920
- Yay! Okay!
- Okay.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.240
- Ah.
- Ah.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.120
We made it.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.080
Look at that.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.760
So…

01:39.440 --> 01:42.960
do you want to unpack
or fuck first and then unpack?

01:46.080 --> 01:47.240
B.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.720
If you could be sitting with me

01:51.800 --> 01:54.000
or any woman in history,
who would you choose?

01:54.560 --> 01:58.480
Ah, it's a toss-up between you,

01:58.560 --> 02:01.440
Janes Mansfield and Fonda,

02:01.920 --> 02:06.120
Debbie Harry,
or Beyoncé at any point in history.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.200
You?

02:07.960 --> 02:11.920
Um… Marlon Brando.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.440
- Ah.
- Albert Camus…

02:13.480 --> 02:14.440
- Uh-hmm.
- Rasputin…

02:14.960 --> 02:16.840
"Russia's greatest love machine."

02:16.880 --> 02:19.160
Um, Paul Newman,

02:19.840 --> 02:22.520
Iggy Pop, the young Elvis Presley.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.080
It's getting crowded.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.680
Henry Miller.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.560
Ryan Gosling.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.760
And you.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.600
Oh, wait! Steve McQueen.

02:30.680 --> 02:31.880
Henry Miller.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.040
Ryan Gosling.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.240
Otis Redding.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.720
Prince. You.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.320
It's nice that we can be honest
about these things.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.040
- Ow.
- Ah, I made him do that.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.280
Oh, he's waking up.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.440
Yeah?

02:43.520 --> 02:44.840
Yeah.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.160
- Feel that?
- Yeah.

02:47.240 --> 02:49.080
Do you think he's gonna like us?

02:49.160 --> 02:50.240
At first.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.560
Then he'll find us embarrassing.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.480
Then hate us.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.960
Then hopefully after a while
he'll like us again.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.800
But not too much, eh, so when we're gone,

02:58.880 --> 03:01.640
he misses us for a bit,
and then forgets all about us.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.040
Happy Anniversary, Mrs Buckingham.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.440
And you, Mr. Buckingham.

03:22.240 --> 03:23.720
Listen to this!

03:23.800 --> 03:26.360
"Looking for the ultimate in relaxation?

03:26.440 --> 03:29.880

03:39.560 --> 03:40.680
- Shall we?
- Do it!

03:40.760 --> 03:41.880
All right.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.680
Sonia from Plymouth.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.280
It is your lucky day.

03:53.280 --> 03:57.960
Two Reiki slash massages, please!

04:01.520 --> 04:02.920
Amandine!

04:03.000 --> 04:04.680
Amandine! You gotta get out here!

04:04.760 --> 04:05.720
There's a whale!

04:05.800 --> 04:08.280
I'm not joking, there's a fucking whale!

04:08.360 --> 04:10.280
Come and-- there's a fucking whale…

04:14.920 --> 04:15.880
Hi.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.800
Hello.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.960
Amandine!

04:20.000 --> 04:24.200
There's a whale and Tom Jones,
an actual Tom Jones!

04:24.240 --> 04:25.680
- Amandine…
- Jamie,

04:27.720 --> 04:28.800
I'm bleeding.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.760
It's gonna be okay.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.720
No, it doesn't
feel like it's going to be okay.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.360
- Excuse me, you can't come any further.
- I don't wanna leave her.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.920
Sorry, you have to wait here.

05:31.880 --> 05:32.920
Hey.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.160
Hey.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.120
How are you feeling?

05:46.200 --> 05:47.120
High.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.640
Well, that's something.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.240
Let's look on the bright side.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.280
At least now he'll never hate us.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.600
Yeah.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.960
What did you do last night?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.400
I, uh…

06:09.680 --> 06:10.920
I had a scotch.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.280
And then I spent like six hours on Google.

06:17.520 --> 06:20.960
I now know all there is about blue whales.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.720
And Tom Jones.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.320
You can test me.

06:25.400 --> 06:29.000
"Largest mammal on Earth", Tom Jones.

06:30.560 --> 06:34.480
His tongue weighs 2.7 tons.

06:35.160 --> 06:40.120
Tom Jones' penis
is the largest of any living organism.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.400
Ten feet.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.760
It's okay. It's okay. Shh, it's okay.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.360
Oh, baby. It's okay.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.240
Are you all right?

06:53.320 --> 06:54.640
What d'you need?

06:54.720 --> 06:56.320
- We need to tell people.
- We don't.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.680
- We don't need to do anything.
- It's happened.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.200
I don't even have
everybody's numbers, baby.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.160
Here.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.200
Call everyone.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.040
I want a funeral.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.240
- Not-- Not a funeral…
- Okay.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.640
…something, something to say goodbye.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.720
Sure.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.920
When they took you in there…

07:23.240 --> 07:26.400
When they took you away,
I went outside into the car park…

07:30.120 --> 07:31.280
and I prayed.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.160
You don't believe in God.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.240
I know I don't.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.800
Absolute bollocks, but I did.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.400
I prayed to Him or-- I don't know,

07:37.480 --> 07:42.680
'cause I said he could take the baby
but he can't take you.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.560
I said however much he loves you…

07:49.200 --> 07:51.800
doesn't come close to how much I love you.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.600
Well, he listened.

07:56.680 --> 07:57.840
Yeah, he did,

07:58.760 --> 08:00.640
even though he doesn't exist.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.440
No, no, it will be fine. Yes, sure.

08:08.520 --> 08:12.040
See you later. Thank you, Beatrice.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.040
Hey, Mum.

08:14.920 --> 08:18.160
No. I'm on Amandine's phone,
I have a terrible signal.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.080
Is Dad around? I've…

08:20.800 --> 08:22.120
I've gotta tell you something.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.640
I forgot to say, the fish van was in town.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.280
I got some squid.

08:36.640 --> 08:37.920
Lovely.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.200
Yeah, when I was in school
I did this project on octopuses,

08:41.880 --> 08:45.120
and I stood in front of the whole class,
I was really nervous,

08:45.200 --> 08:47.640
and I stood there
and the first thing I said was,

08:47.720 --> 08:49.600
"An octopus has eight testicles".

08:50.640 --> 08:53.480
"Tentacles!" I mean "Tentacles!".

08:56.840 --> 08:57.720
Oh!

08:58.440 --> 09:00.840
Talk about a swallow-me-up moment,
I mean, please!

09:00.880 --> 09:02.160
Take me right now!

09:04.600 --> 09:05.880
Lue?

09:06.520 --> 09:07.760
- Lue?
- Hmm?

09:14.760 --> 09:15.760
Cup of tea?

09:16.840 --> 09:17.880
Lovely.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.040
Hey, Lue, it's me.
I'm on Amandine's phone.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.440
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

09:33.960 --> 09:34.760
How is she?

09:34.880 --> 09:35.720
She's fine.

09:35.760 --> 09:37.720
I mean, you know, she's okay.

09:38.880 --> 09:43.280
We're okay, it'll be--
you know, it'll be okay.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.840
Have you told Mum and Dad?

09:45.160 --> 09:46.400
I just did, yeah.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.600
Listen, Lue, I'm gonna have to go,
I haven't got a great signal here.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.320
I love you, Jamie.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.160
I love you too.

10:29.760 --> 10:30.760
Hey!

10:31.440 --> 10:32.640
You're my neighbour, right?

10:33.280 --> 10:35.520
I'm Tom from next door.
Pleased to meet you.

10:36.480 --> 10:38.640
I don't know about you
but I'm coming back.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.040
I mean, this is like a landscape
you already know!

10:42.120 --> 10:44.880
It's like something
that's etched in your soul.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.600
Do you ever get that?

10:49.080 --> 10:50.520
- You all right?

10:57.400 --> 10:58.800
Jesus Christ!

10:58.880 --> 11:00.880
What was it, an oyster or something?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.320
Tom Jones.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.240
Yeah.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.200
Jamie, mate, it's time.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.920
How do I look?

12:02.440 --> 12:04.320
I mean, your nose
is a bit too close to your mouth.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.880
Okay. Thanks mate, cheers.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.360
Your love is so strong.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.280
Whatever else you do
keep remembering this…

12:26.720 --> 12:28.440
at least you still have each other.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.960
Hmm. Yeah, thank you. I appreciate that.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.080
Cheers.

12:33.720 --> 12:39.080
My father… er, was the lead violinist
with the Philharmonie de Paris.

12:39.480 --> 12:42.200
When Amandine was small
she used to sit at his knee,

12:42.280 --> 12:44.360
and listen to him play Mozart.

12:45.960 --> 12:50.320
This… this is your grandfather's violin.

12:52.040 --> 12:54.000
We meant it to be for your son.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.960
Now, it will be for your next son.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.000
Thanks, Mum.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.920
Thanks, Beatrice.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.760
That's incredibly kind, thank you.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.160
Um, I know most of you

13:14.240 --> 13:16.760
probably wondered why
we needed to do this.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.200
Uh, but what matters to us
is that you came,

13:21.280 --> 13:24.040
and so I wanted to say something.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.760
Something to my husband. Um…

13:31.960 --> 13:35.240
Jamie, you are the most amazing,

13:36.600 --> 13:41.200
deep, fun, sexy man in the world,

13:41.960 --> 13:43.200
and I love you,

13:43.280 --> 13:46.120
and I want to have
a hundred more children with you.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.040
I love you too.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.080
I love you.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.280
To Jamie and Amandine.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.840
To Jamie and Amandine.

13:59.920 --> 14:00.960
Merci.

14:08.160 --> 14:10.680
Um, I'm not going in today.

14:10.760 --> 14:11.880
I feel terrible.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.560
Okay. Well, see you later.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.640
It's embarrassing, actually.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.960
Not-- Not embarrassing, nah, it's just…

16:02.520 --> 16:05.400
it's a bit awkward
because she's your sister.

16:06.160 --> 16:10.360
But, well, she's started doing this thing

16:10.440 --> 16:12.560
where I'll start talking,
telling a story--

16:12.640 --> 16:14.880
something that happened
that day or something--

16:14.960 --> 16:16.400
something small or some bollocks, I dunno.

16:16.480 --> 16:20.480
Anyway, I get to the point of this story

16:20.880 --> 16:24.440
and she doesn't even notice.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.840
She didn't even know I was talking.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.760
It's like she's a million miles away

16:28.840 --> 16:30.880
and everything I say
is just in the background.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.880
If you're with someone you love
and trying to say something--

16:33.960 --> 16:35.320
Do you know anyone called Paul?

16:37.960 --> 16:38.880
What?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.040
Nothing.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.280
Doesn't matter.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.520
Look, I'm no expert

16:45.600 --> 16:47.880
but maybe you and Amandine
should talk to someone.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.520
Get some therapy or something?

16:50.280 --> 16:51.600
You've both been through the ringer.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.200
You're probably in shock.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.600
Yeah, I am in shock.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.640
- That's what it is.
- Sounds like it.

16:55.720 --> 16:56.640
- Completely normal.
- Shock.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.640
Read that.

16:57.960 --> 16:58.880
What is it?

16:59.720 --> 17:01.440
Just read it. Out loud.

17:08.080 --> 17:09.840
"Paul: When you back?",

17:11.200 --> 17:12.800
"Amandine: Monday".

17:13.680 --> 17:15.280
"Paul: I miss you."

17:16.240 --> 17:18.320
"Amandine: I miss you too."

17:18.960 --> 17:20.080
Sad face.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.560
"Paul: I miss your arse."

17:27.560 --> 17:29.960
"Amandine: I miss your cock."

17:32.080 --> 17:34.640
"Paul: I wanna come all over your face."

17:36.520 --> 17:39.320
"Amandine: As soon as you get back."

17:39.440 --> 17:40.400
Kiss.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.320
How's Jamie?

18:19.400 --> 18:20.560
He'll be fine.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.720
- Go!

18:32.000 --> 18:32.960
Go!

18:35.680 --> 18:37.440
There's a good girl. Come on.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.720
Shh.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.480
Hey, stay.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.560
Good girl.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.520
Stay. Stay.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.680
You're okay.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.320
You're okay.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.480
There's a good boy.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.560
You're okay.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.800
Shh.

19:12.760 --> 19:13.800
That's it.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.080
That's it, just breathe.

20:03.560 --> 20:04.800
Who the fuck are you?

20:06.400 --> 20:07.240
Sit down.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.520
Get the fuck out of my house!

20:08.560 --> 20:10.160
I'm Amandine's husband.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.720
Okay, it's funny, isn't it?

20:31.960 --> 20:35.320
You're just bobbing along in your life,

20:36.040 --> 20:37.280
day to day,

20:37.960 --> 20:39.640
in one reality…

20:41.560 --> 20:45.520
and then suddenly, disaster strikes.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.080
And you look around
and you find yourself all alone

20:50.160 --> 20:53.640
on the beach with Tom Jones.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.320
What?

21:04.680 --> 21:07.520
Café Chino on the Old Brompton Road.

21:09.240 --> 21:12.320
Jose's Tapas Bar on Bermondsey Street.

21:13.080 --> 21:16.080
An afternoon trip to see
the recently restored original print

21:16.160 --> 21:19.040
of Francois Truffaut's
400 Blows at the BFI.

21:23.760 --> 21:28.080
The Uber Lux back here afterwards.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.400
I've been watching you for two weeks.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.240
I know everything about you.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.520
Where you work,

21:38.640 --> 21:39.800
live,

21:40.320 --> 21:43.280
the key under the brick
next to the dead geranium.

21:43.320 --> 21:46.800
The girlfriend you met Monday
in Soho Square

21:46.880 --> 21:48.640
and took to Wagamama's.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.560
Wendy Wilson.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.920
Wendy was wearing an engagement ring.

21:55.320 --> 21:56.960
Do I hear wedding bells, mate?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.240
- Okay…
- You've been fucking my wife.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.400
Just listen to me.

22:01.480 --> 22:06.480
Have you or haven't you
been fucking my wife?

22:09.400 --> 22:10.640
Please don't tell Wendy.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.840
- Good.
- Please.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.160
So you have.

22:17.840 --> 22:18.840
Good.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.920
See 'cause there's a problem with this.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.440
'Cause I love my wife.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.520
I do.

22:33.840 --> 22:36.880
I love her so much, I don't think
there's anything I wouldn't do for her.

22:36.960 --> 22:42.760
I don't mean… breaking into your dank,
half as nice as it thinks it is flat.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.520
I mean, I'd die for her.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.320
I'd kill for her.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.400
So you got a choice to make.

22:55.920 --> 22:59.040
You can end this right now,

22:59.120 --> 23:02.960
and you never, ever,
speak to my wife again,

23:04.560 --> 23:06.840
or I'm gonna open that big dark box.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.800
That's right, Paul.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.560
Starting with paying a visit
to your fiancé,

23:12.640 --> 23:16.320
who works at the dermatology clinic
on Harley Street as a receptionist.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.720
So it's time to choose.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.320
What's it gonna be, Paul?

23:29.440 --> 23:30.720
Who's Paul?
