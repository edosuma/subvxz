00:08.351 --> 00:09.884
Please welcome Nathan Fielder.

00:13.098 --> 00:14.798
If you watch late-night TV,

00:14.865 --> 00:16.231
you might have seen my recent guest spot

00:16.297 --> 00:18.231
on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"

00:18.298 --> 00:20.865
As you can see, I'm very relaxed,

00:20.931 --> 00:22.998
and getting big laughs
from the audience.

00:25.731 --> 00:27.231
Firstly...

00:27.298 --> 00:29.098
But what you could never guess

00:29.165 --> 00:31.031
is that this seemingly
effortless appearance

00:31.098 --> 00:33.531
was one of the most calculated events

00:33.598 --> 00:35.031
in human history.

00:38.398 --> 00:40.131
Every year, when the new season

00:40.198 --> 00:41.698
of "Nathan For You"
is about to premiere,

00:41.765 --> 00:43.114
Comedy Central will schedule

00:43.200 --> 00:45.733
promotional appearances for
me on late-night talk shows.

00:45.971 --> 00:47.237
Please welcome Nathan Fielder!

00:47.492 --> 00:48.492
Nathan Fielder!

00:48.528 --> 00:49.490
Nathan Fielder.

00:49.552 --> 00:51.082
Nathan Fielder, everybody.

00:53.465 --> 00:55.931
But as someone who's not
naturally charismatic,

00:55.998 --> 00:58.722
these appearances have
often gone awkwardly for me,

00:58.781 --> 01:01.003
as I've struggled to
find interesting things

01:01.131 --> 01:02.598
to say about myself.

01:02.665 --> 01:03.965
What part of Canada are you from?

01:04.031 --> 01:05.465
- Vancouver.
- Oh.

01:05.531 --> 01:07.065
- Have you been?
- Yes.

01:07.131 --> 01:08.631
Yes, I like it there.

01:08.698 --> 01:09.372
It's, uh, really nice.

01:09.427 --> 01:12.931
You see, celebrities
normally use talk shows

01:12.998 --> 01:15.131
to give fans a window
into their exciting lives.

01:15.198 --> 01:17.365
Me and the president are like this.

01:17.365 --> 01:18.431
We're best friends.

01:18.498 --> 01:19.865
But unlike Kevin Hart,

01:19.931 --> 01:21.560
I haven't met the president.

01:21.670 --> 01:24.336
My life just isn't that interesting.

01:24.403 --> 01:25.396
When I'm not at work,

01:25.451 --> 01:27.770
I mostly just spend time with my cats.

01:27.836 --> 01:29.341
You guys trying to take a shower?

01:29.482 --> 01:30.848
Or try to perfect a cooking skill,

01:31.603 --> 01:34.052
like boiling eggs.

01:34.141 --> 01:35.708
So when I was recently emailed a date

01:36.336 --> 01:37.903
to appear on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"

01:37.970 --> 01:39.236
to promote the new season,

01:39.303 --> 01:41.003
I was filled with dread.

01:41.070 --> 01:43.070
Any potential story I tried to tell

01:43.170 --> 01:44.770
just felt boring.

01:44.836 --> 01:46.936
When you take them out
of the boiling water,

01:47.003 --> 01:48.303
you need to put them into ice water

01:48.370 --> 01:51.203
immediately, or else the yolks

01:51.270 --> 01:53.470
don't, you know...

01:53.536 --> 01:55.336
they'll... they'll
keep cooking, you know?

01:55.403 --> 01:56.770
And they'll get too hard.

01:56.836 --> 01:58.003
Mm-hmm.

01:58.070 --> 01:59.636
With the pressure on me

01:59.703 --> 02:01.142
to gain viewers for the new season,

02:01.173 --> 02:04.036
I just couldn't afford to
bomb on a talk show again.

02:04.170 --> 02:05.403
You want to come back on another night,

02:05.470 --> 02:06.970
- and we'll try this again?
- Sorry.

02:08.321 --> 02:10.735
So I began researching
talk show appearances

02:10.803 --> 02:13.303
and discovered that these
seemingly random stories

02:13.370 --> 02:16.670
all followed a very similar formula.

02:16.736 --> 02:19.170
They were all based
around a crazy experience

02:19.203 --> 02:21.970
that the celebrity had,
and the best ones involved

02:22.036 --> 02:23.470
either a funny picture,

02:23.536 --> 02:25.370
a twist ending...

02:25.436 --> 02:27.170
And my friend walks
by, and I grabbed her,

02:27.236 --> 02:28.870
and I was like, "This
is Elizabeth Taylor!"

02:28.936 --> 02:31.736
And she was like, "No, it's not."

02:31.803 --> 02:33.703
Or what seemed to be the gold standard

02:35.172 --> 02:38.036
getting pulled over by a cop
at the worst possible time.

02:38.170 --> 02:40.070
The police pulled me over.

02:40.170 --> 02:41.736
And this, uh, policeman
comes up, pulls me over...

02:41.803 --> 02:42.936
And I see the sirens behind me,

02:43.003 --> 02:44.703
and I get pulled over,

02:44.770 --> 02:46.636
- And I got pulled over.
- I get pulled over.

02:46.703 --> 02:48.303
- The cops pulled us over.
- And I got pulled over.

02:48.370 --> 02:50.070
And it was really embarrassing.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.170
- The cop pulled me over.
- I got pulled over.

02:52.203 --> 02:53.936
- The cops pulled me over.
- And we got pulled over.

02:54.003 --> 02:55.836
The lights are flashing, and I'm like,

02:55.903 --> 02:57.836
"Oh, who are they pulling
over?' And I realize it's me.

02:57.903 --> 03:00.528
And I said, "I'm so sorry,
police... Mr. Policeman."

03:00.653 --> 03:03.153
I do know that I was pulled
over twice in one week.

03:03.215 --> 03:05.170
How do you get pulled over
4 times and not get a ticket?

03:05.203 --> 03:06.936
This was really funny, actually.

03:07.003 --> 03:09.170
They were so... I
was... I got pulled over,

03:09.170 --> 03:11.070
So after watching nearly six hours

03:11.170 --> 03:13.603
of celebrity interviews
and taking extensive notes,

03:13.670 --> 03:16.436
I had compiled enough ideas to construct

03:16.503 --> 03:20.770
what could very well be the
ultimate talk show anecdote.

03:20.836 --> 03:22.736
If I was flying to
an out-of-town wedding

03:22.803 --> 03:24.370
and I accidentally grabbed

03:24.436 --> 03:26.043
the wrong suitcase at the airport,

03:26.114 --> 03:28.903
I could tell a funny tale
about being forced to wear

03:28.970 --> 03:31.170
the oversized suit of a stranger,

03:31.203 --> 03:33.670
and then, if I discovered a small baggie

03:33.736 --> 03:35.936
containing a chalky
substance in the pocket,

03:36.003 --> 03:38.903
moments before a cop
pulled me over for speeding,

03:38.970 --> 03:41.270
it would add a heavy dose of suspense,

03:41.336 --> 03:43.436
and finally, if the owner of the suit

03:43.503 --> 03:45.436
told me that the substance in the baggie

03:45.503 --> 03:47.436
was actually his mother's ashes,

03:47.503 --> 03:49.936
it would be a twist ending so unexpected

03:50.003 --> 03:52.003
that the audience on
"Jimmy Kimmel Live!"

03:52.070 --> 03:53.936
would shower me with
laughter and applause

03:54.003 --> 03:56.403
unlike anything I'd experienced before.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.170
So I put on the suit,
and I look like a...

03:58.203 --> 04:00.336
you know, a Dick Tracy
villain or something.

04:00.403 --> 04:01.286
- Dick Tracy.
- You know?

04:01.333 --> 04:02.067
Yeah.

04:02.122 --> 04:04.503
When I told the story
to my employee Salomon,

04:04.570 --> 04:06.970
it killed, but there
was still one problem...

04:07.036 --> 04:09.170
it was entirely made-up,

04:09.236 --> 04:10.536
and to lie on a talk show

04:10.603 --> 04:12.003
would be a massive risk.

04:12.070 --> 04:13.836
Brian Williams once did it.

04:13.903 --> 04:16.435
Uh, two of our four helicopters were hit

04:16.503 --> 04:18.435
by ground fire, including
the one I was in.

04:18.503 --> 04:19.603
No kidding.

04:19.670 --> 04:21.403
Uh, RPG and AK-47.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.170
And it destroyed his career.

04:23.170 --> 04:25.770
I want to apologize.
I said I was traveling

04:25.836 --> 04:28.603
in an aircraft that was hit by RPG fire.

04:28.670 --> 04:29.936
I made a mistake.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.170
I didn't want to become

04:31.236 --> 04:32.402
the next Brian Williams.

04:32.472 --> 04:35.336
So that meant, to ensure
my story wasn't a lie,

04:35.403 --> 04:38.536
I'd have to orchestrate an
elaborate series of events

04:38.603 --> 04:40.470
to make every single plot point

04:40.536 --> 04:42.170
happen to me for real.

04:42.236 --> 04:43.870
My story begins with me attending

04:43.936 --> 04:45.503
an out-of-town wedding,

04:45.570 --> 04:47.003
so the first thing I'd have to do

04:47.070 --> 04:48.670
is get invited to one.

04:48.736 --> 04:50.303
To do this, I decided to approach

04:50.370 --> 04:52.503
the owner of a popular wedding venue

04:52.570 --> 04:54.436
in Agoura Hills, California,

04:54.503 --> 04:56.603
pretending to be planning
a wedding of my own.

04:56.670 --> 04:58.170
- Thanks so much.
- You here by yourself?

04:58.170 --> 05:00.170
- Yeah. My wife couldn't...
- Okay.

05:00.203 --> 05:03.003
My fiancée couldn't be here.
She, uh, she has Klein's,

05:03.070 --> 05:05.370
- so she has to stay in bed.
- Okay. Okay, cool.

05:05.444 --> 05:07.544
- Well, you want to see the ranch?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, I'd love to.

05:07.603 --> 05:08.565
All right. Come on, let me show you.

05:08.596 --> 05:09.635
- Looks beautiful.
- Thank you.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.675
But my real goal

05:10.725 --> 05:12.985
was to get the names
and contact information

05:13.095 --> 05:15.602
of a couple whose nuptials
were quickly approaching.

05:15.813 --> 05:17.803
I'd love to talk to one of these couples

05:17.870 --> 05:19.503
that's, uh, going to
be getting married here,

05:19.570 --> 05:21.403
to, you know...

05:21.470 --> 05:23.198
Find out how they're planning it.

05:23.292 --> 05:25.836
Um, I could put you in touch
with the planners. You know?

05:25.903 --> 05:27.570
Oh, okay. You don't trust me?

05:27.636 --> 05:30.503
I trust you.

05:30.570 --> 05:33.070
So why not just give me their number?

05:33.170 --> 05:34.870
Um, 'cause I don't want to

05:34.936 --> 05:36.536
just give you a client's phone number.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.036
I'd have to clear that
with them first, you know?

05:38.170 --> 05:39.170
But the venue manager

05:39.236 --> 05:40.836
was stonewalling me.

05:40.903 --> 05:42.870
So when she left to go to the bathroom,

05:42.936 --> 05:44.470
I looked through her computer

05:44.536 --> 05:46.170
and got the information I needed.

05:47.936 --> 05:49.503
Now that I had the
names and phone numbers

05:49.570 --> 05:51.403
of some soon-to-be-married couples,

05:51.470 --> 05:54.170
we contacted one of them
as a wedding reality show,

05:54.203 --> 05:56.070
and they agreed to meet with me,

05:56.170 --> 05:58.670
thinking I was a fiancé
who needed planning advice.

05:58.736 --> 06:01.770
A lot of the wedding planning I'm doing,

06:01.836 --> 06:04.203
because she has to
sleep most of the day,

06:04.270 --> 06:06.536
as Klein's does to you, but, uh...

06:06.603 --> 06:08.770
you know, I'm taking it on myself,

06:08.836 --> 06:11.536
and I'm really excited to... to do it.

06:11.603 --> 06:13.003
It's nice. It's a good feeling.

06:13.070 --> 06:13.773
Yeah.

06:13.867 --> 06:16.603
The couple was gracious enough
to give me some pointers.

06:16.670 --> 06:18.236
- Pinterest.
- Pinterest?

06:18.303 --> 06:20.203
Yes. You know, especially
if she's resting

06:20.270 --> 06:21.670
and she can just mess with
the computer, it's so easy.

06:21.736 --> 06:23.303
But what they didn't know

06:23.370 --> 06:25.203
was that my only purpose for being there

06:25.270 --> 06:27.470
was to score a real
invite to their wedding.

06:27.536 --> 06:29.336
You know, I'd love to see the...

06:29.403 --> 06:32.470
the venue when there's an
actual wedding going on.

06:32.536 --> 06:34.070
I don't know if...

06:34.170 --> 06:37.070
could... take a peek, or...

06:37.170 --> 06:39.170
Like, the setup and everything of it?

06:39.203 --> 06:41.903
Yeah, before, and maybe...

06:41.970 --> 06:44.670
a little bit during, or...

06:46.703 --> 06:49.636
I mean...

06:49.703 --> 06:51.670
- Of ours?
- Uh, yeah.

06:51.736 --> 06:53.770
I mean, just to...
look, I really want to be

06:53.836 --> 06:55.870
- thorough with my research.
- I don't know.

06:55.936 --> 06:58.803
A lot going on on that day,
so we're not sure if we want

06:58.870 --> 07:01.703
someone coming around and
having to worry about that.

07:01.770 --> 07:03.703
Oh, you wouldn't have to worry about me.

07:03.770 --> 07:05.470
- I'd just take a peek and...
- It's a...

07:05.536 --> 07:07.736
it's just a really...
it's a really busy day.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.336
There's going to be a lot going on,

07:09.403 --> 07:11.070
and it starts at, like, 9:00 a.m.

07:11.170 --> 07:12.836
Or at least I have to
be there at, like, 9:00.

07:12.903 --> 07:13.970
Something like that.

07:14.036 --> 07:16.070
You know, I wouldn't eat...

07:16.170 --> 07:17.836
wouldn't have to eat or drink
or... you know, I wouldn't be...

07:17.903 --> 07:19.203
Just to check out.

07:19.270 --> 07:20.370
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we get that.

07:20.436 --> 07:22.970
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

07:23.036 --> 07:26.370
Just, you know, for my fiancée
to... who can't be there.

07:26.436 --> 07:30.270
She'll be resting, so...

07:30.336 --> 07:32.536
Yeah, maybe. I mean,
it would be a cool...

07:32.603 --> 07:33.970
I mean, it'd be cool for
you to see everything.

07:34.036 --> 07:37.070
Yeah. All right.

07:37.170 --> 07:39.036
So I'm invited, I guess, or...

07:39.170 --> 07:41.470
Um...

07:43.603 --> 07:47.736
- Just invited to look.
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:47.803 --> 07:49.603
You're invited to come and see, sure.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.936
- That's great. Okay.
- Yeah.

07:53.613 --> 07:55.246
It was now an undeniable fact

07:55.313 --> 07:57.917
that I was invited to a real wedding,

07:58.004 --> 07:59.304
and with those words,

07:59.370 --> 08:00.804
my made-up story for Kimmel

08:00.870 --> 08:02.504
was starting to become true.

08:02.570 --> 08:04.304
But making my next plot point happen

08:04.370 --> 08:05.604
would take some work.

08:05.670 --> 08:07.370
Arranging a luggage mix-up

08:07.437 --> 08:09.504
with a man who packed an oversized suit

08:09.570 --> 08:11.604
that has his real mother's ashes

08:11.670 --> 08:12.918
stored in the pocket.

08:13.004 --> 08:15.404
So I reached out to
the Craigslist community

08:15.470 --> 08:17.804
seeing if anyone who
had their mother's ashes

08:17.870 --> 08:21.004
and a large suit would
be willing to help me out,

08:21.004 --> 08:23.304
and within days, I had a few responses.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.870
I actually have two different bags.

08:26.004 --> 08:28.537
One are my father's ashes,
and one are my mother's ashes.

08:28.604 --> 08:30.704
- Okay.
- But unfortunately,

08:30.770 --> 08:32.870
when it came time to try on their suits,

08:33.004 --> 08:35.703
none of them were big enough
to provide the comedic effect

08:35.770 --> 08:37.169
I needed for my story.

08:37.236 --> 08:39.470
Yeah, this is basically my size.

08:39.537 --> 08:41.470
There was one guy named Sal

08:41.537 --> 08:43.004
whose suit was really big and good.

08:43.004 --> 08:44.704
This is good.

08:44.770 --> 08:47.170
But unfortunately, he
misunderstood the ad,

08:47.237 --> 08:49.870
and believed the ashes
weren't supposed to be real.

08:50.004 --> 08:51.370
The post said, you know,

08:51.437 --> 08:53.670
I wanted your real mother's ashes.

08:53.737 --> 08:55.204
Yeah. I thought it was
going to be provided for me.

08:55.270 --> 08:56.837
Like a prop or something.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.204
- Oh, okay.
- I didn't think they'd need

08:58.270 --> 09:00.004
an actual mother's ashes.

09:00.070 --> 09:02.037
I... is your mom dead?

09:02.104 --> 09:03.737
No.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.704
Okay.

09:05.770 --> 09:08.204
It was unfortunate that
Sal's mom was still alive,

09:08.270 --> 09:11.404
because the suit was
perfect, but after he left,

09:11.470 --> 09:13.670
I realized there might still be a way

09:13.737 --> 09:15.870
of getting those ashes I needed.

09:16.004 --> 09:18.737
So I asked him to meet me at
his mom's house the next day

09:18.804 --> 09:20.770
to tell him my creative work-around.

09:20.837 --> 09:23.204
Technically, ashes can be

09:23.270 --> 09:26.170
any part of her, as long as it's burned.

09:26.237 --> 09:29.437
So I figure, if there's stuff

09:29.504 --> 09:32.037
from her body that she doesn't use,

09:32.104 --> 09:35.604
like, you know, nails, or an old tooth,

09:35.670 --> 09:37.570
or some hair, maybe,

09:37.637 --> 09:39.770
if we use that,

09:39.837 --> 09:42.170
we should be fine.

09:42.237 --> 09:43.904
Uh, what do you think?

09:44.004 --> 09:45.704
How much hair?

09:45.770 --> 09:48.004
It just has to be enough
to fill a tiny baggie.

09:48.070 --> 09:49.537
Just a... just a little bit.

09:49.604 --> 09:51.004
Like a trim from the bottom, or...

09:51.070 --> 09:52.170
Yeah.

09:52.237 --> 09:54.304
Just a little bit.

09:57.070 --> 09:59.004
Okay, I'll talk to her. See what she...

09:59.004 --> 10:00.804
The nails and the
hairs, I'm pretty sure.

10:00.870 --> 10:03.160
- Okay.
- I'll see what she says.

10:03.253 --> 10:05.804
And with that, we
headed in to meet Mommy.

10:05.870 --> 10:07.370
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too.

10:07.437 --> 10:10.470
So, um, an opportunity came up for me,

10:10.537 --> 10:13.237
and, pretty much, uh,

10:13.304 --> 10:14.537
he's going to be in a talk show,

10:14.604 --> 10:16.704
and he wants to tell a story.

10:16.770 --> 10:19.304
So in order for it to be real,

10:19.370 --> 10:22.270
we need a little bit of your
hair and some nail clippings,

10:22.337 --> 10:23.570
and then we're going to burn them up,

10:23.637 --> 10:25.204
and turn them into ashes.

10:25.270 --> 10:28.237
- Hair from... my hair?
- Your hair, yeah.

10:28.304 --> 10:29.770
There was a miscommunication.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.404
I thought you were dead, so I thought

10:31.470 --> 10:33.404
- he had your ashes.
- Um...

10:33.470 --> 10:35.104
We just need a little bit.

10:35.170 --> 10:37.404
My hair is okay. My hair...

10:37.470 --> 10:38.704
You're not gonna go bald.

10:38.770 --> 10:40.537
I don't know...

10:40.604 --> 10:42.704
Yes, it's a good opportunity
for you, it's okay.

10:42.770 --> 10:44.570
With Sal's mom on board,

10:44.637 --> 10:46.704
we started collecting
some parts of her body

10:46.770 --> 10:49.237
that we'd then convert into ashes.

10:49.304 --> 10:50.737
Along with the hair trimmings,

10:50.804 --> 10:53.237
she also gave us her fingernails,

10:53.304 --> 10:56.704
some dead skin from her feet,

10:56.770 --> 11:00.170
and contributed some ear
wax that we added to the bag.

11:00.237 --> 11:03.004
We also got permission
to snake her drain

11:03.004 --> 11:04.770
for any body parts that
might have fallen in

11:04.837 --> 11:06.437
during a shower.

11:06.504 --> 11:08.870
Once I felt I had enough of Sal's mom,

11:09.004 --> 11:11.337
we rushed her parts
to a local crematory,

11:11.404 --> 11:13.737
where the remains were put in a big oven

11:13.804 --> 11:16.004
and incinerated at
temperatures exceeding

11:16.004 --> 11:18.737
1,400 degrees Fahrenheit.

11:18.804 --> 11:20.837
So with Sal's real mother's ashes

11:20.904 --> 11:22.070
now in hand,

11:22.137 --> 11:24.104
and the wedding just days away,

11:24.170 --> 11:26.004
I could now prepare
for the luggage mix-up

11:26.004 --> 11:28.004
that would be the catalyst of my story.

11:28.070 --> 11:31.070
So I transferred the ashes
to a small Ziploc baggie

11:31.137 --> 11:33.004
and had Sal put them

11:33.070 --> 11:35.004
in the inside breast
pocket of his suit jacket,

11:35.037 --> 11:36.537
which he was instructed to pack

11:36.604 --> 11:38.670
in one of two identical suitcases

11:38.737 --> 11:40.437
I'd purchased earlier that week.

11:40.504 --> 11:42.137
- Thanks, Sal.
- You're welcome.

11:42.204 --> 11:44.870
It turned out the wedding
venue in Agoura Hills

11:45.004 --> 11:48.470
was only a 45-minute drive
from my home in Los Angeles,

11:48.537 --> 11:50.837
but for a real luggage
mix-up to happen,

11:50.904 --> 11:52.637
I would need to fly,

11:52.704 --> 11:55.137
so I booked a round-trip
ticket to San Francisco

11:55.204 --> 11:57.137
that would immediately
return to Los Angeles

11:57.204 --> 11:58.804
that same morning.

11:58.870 --> 12:01.004
And when the big day finally came,

12:01.004 --> 12:03.904
it was time to bring my story to life.

12:06.176 --> 12:07.909
The day of the wedding had arrived.

12:07.976 --> 12:11.101
So I headed to LAX,
where I had pre-arranged

12:11.141 --> 12:13.574
for Sal to be booked on
the same flight as me.

12:13.641 --> 12:15.541
From this moment forward,

12:15.608 --> 12:17.274
everything would need
to happen like clockwork,

12:17.341 --> 12:20.108
so when Sal and I
landed in San Francisco,

12:20.174 --> 12:21.908
we both got our bags

12:22.008 --> 12:23.608
and then immediately
checked them back in

12:23.674 --> 12:25.541
for our return flight to LA.

12:25.608 --> 12:28.574
Sal and I didn't exchange a single word

12:28.641 --> 12:30.274
throughout the entire round trip,

12:30.341 --> 12:33.374
which is typical for two strangers.

12:33.441 --> 12:35.508
When the flight landed in Los Angeles,

12:35.574 --> 12:37.208
we both went to the luggage carousel

12:37.274 --> 12:39.208
where Sal was told to take my bag.

12:39.274 --> 12:41.374
So when his luggage came around,

12:41.441 --> 12:43.041
it would be a true fact

12:43.108 --> 12:44.208
that I grabbed someone else's suitcase

12:44.274 --> 12:45.841
at the airport.

12:45.908 --> 12:47.408
And after getting my rental car

12:47.474 --> 12:49.041
and making the hour-long drive

12:49.108 --> 12:50.841
to my hotel in Agoura Hills,

12:50.908 --> 12:53.308
it was time for the moment in my story

12:53.374 --> 12:55.108
where I would open
my luggage to discover

12:55.174 --> 12:56.874
none of my clothes were inside.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.808
As instructed, Sal had filled out

13:00.874 --> 13:03.008
his contact info on the luggage tag,

13:03.041 --> 13:05.174
allowing me to call the suitcase owner

13:05.241 --> 13:07.341
and explain that I had
nothing to wear to the wedding.

13:07.408 --> 13:11.018
_

13:11.308 --> 13:13.608
Oh, yeah, that would...
that would be great.

13:13.674 --> 13:16.108
With just 30 minutes until the wedding,

13:16.174 --> 13:18.108
I was now in the oversized suit

13:18.174 --> 13:20.774
that would serve as the
funny visual for my story.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.774
And right on cue, I discovered

13:22.841 --> 13:24.708
the suspicious baggie in the pocket,

13:24.774 --> 13:26.774
setting the scene for
the essential moment

13:26.841 --> 13:28.574
of every great talk show anecdote:

13:28.641 --> 13:30.474
getting pulled over by a cop

13:30.541 --> 13:32.441
at the worst possible time.

13:32.508 --> 13:34.574
I didn't want to break the law,

13:34.641 --> 13:36.441
so I had my production team close down

13:36.508 --> 13:37.908
a small stretch of road

13:38.008 --> 13:39.674
en route to the wedding,

13:39.741 --> 13:41.341
where a real police officer I had hired

13:41.408 --> 13:43.141
was waiting and ready to pull me over

13:43.208 --> 13:45.008
the second I surpassed the speed limit.

13:45.008 --> 13:46.008
Ready?

13:46.008 --> 13:47.374
Ready.

13:50.441 --> 13:53.774
* *

13:55.574 --> 13:58.241
Once I crossed 35, I heard the sirens

13:58.308 --> 14:00.174
and pulled over to the side of the road,

14:00.241 --> 14:02.441
making it truthful that
a cop pulled me over

14:02.508 --> 14:04.008
on the way to the wedding.

14:04.074 --> 14:05.508
So all that was left to do

14:05.574 --> 14:07.308
was engage with the officer

14:07.374 --> 14:09.441
in a dialogue I had prepared in advance.

14:09.508 --> 14:10.708
Hey, um...

14:10.774 --> 14:12.508
can you just read these lines?

14:12.574 --> 14:14.641
Yours are highlighted.

14:14.708 --> 14:16.174
Thanks.

14:16.241 --> 14:18.008
License and registration, please.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.774
Here you go, officer.

14:19.841 --> 14:21.441
My hope was that this

14:21.508 --> 14:23.241
strategically crafted interaction

14:23.308 --> 14:25.241
would maximize the suspense of my story

14:25.308 --> 14:28.308
while allowing me to
showcase my quick wit.

14:28.374 --> 14:30.774
Thank God you're not
the, uh, fashion police,

14:30.841 --> 14:32.741
or I'd be in big trouble.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.908
What's that?

14:38.008 --> 14:39.708
What?

14:39.774 --> 14:41.541
That bag on the seat.

14:41.608 --> 14:43.741
Oh, I don't know. It's not mine.

14:43.808 --> 14:45.041
Hand it to me.

14:45.108 --> 14:46.308
The officer was hitting

14:46.374 --> 14:48.074
all his lines perfectly.

14:48.141 --> 14:49.908
So you're telling me
you got the wrong luggage

14:50.008 --> 14:51.741
and this was inside the suit jacket

14:51.808 --> 14:53.108
and it's not even your suit?

14:53.174 --> 14:54.308
I can call the guy.

14:54.374 --> 14:56.241
I have... I have his number.

14:56.308 --> 14:58.641
And it was soon time for
the climax of my story.

14:58.708 --> 15:01.308
All right, so I'm going
to start off with...

15:01.374 --> 15:03.241
Are you the owner of this suit...

15:03.308 --> 15:04.808
Are you the owner of this suit?

15:04.874 --> 15:07.008
Of the suit that this
gentleman's wearing?

15:07.008 --> 15:09.441
Okay. What's in the baggie?

15:11.208 --> 15:13.041
Okay, thank you.

15:13.108 --> 15:15.774
And once the officer
handed back the phone,

15:15.841 --> 15:17.708
all that was left was
the big twist ending.

15:17.774 --> 15:20.374
What did he say was in the baggie?

15:20.441 --> 15:23.508
It's his mother's ashes.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.841
Oh, my.

15:25.908 --> 15:28.008
- That's it. That's me...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.241
Thank you. That was great.
You did great. Thanks.

15:30.308 --> 15:33.141
I did it, and with my
run-in with the law complete,

15:33.208 --> 15:36.708
I made it to the wedding
just in time for the ceremony.

15:36.774 --> 15:38.608
I tried to keep a low profile,

15:38.674 --> 15:40.708
because even though I
was technically invited,

15:40.774 --> 15:43.174
I doubted they'd be thrilled to see me.

15:43.241 --> 15:45.374
The ceremony was beautiful,

15:45.441 --> 15:47.741
and I especially liked the part
where they kissed each other,

15:47.808 --> 15:50.008
because it was so romantic.

15:50.008 --> 15:52.608
With everything I needed
for my story complete,

15:52.674 --> 15:55.008
I could've left right then.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.774
But I ended up staying for hours,

15:56.841 --> 15:58.774
deep into the night,

15:58.841 --> 16:01.041
and as my feet glided
across the dance floor

16:01.108 --> 16:03.574
that had once only existed in my mind,

16:03.641 --> 16:07.174
I realized the exciting
life I had envied in others

16:07.241 --> 16:09.374
had actually become my own.

16:13.351 --> 16:13.982
It was the night

16:14.072 --> 16:16.291
of my appearance on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"

16:16.425 --> 16:18.463
And as I waited for
my turn on the couch,

16:18.534 --> 16:20.368
I was feeling confident.

16:20.434 --> 16:24.368
I'd invested over $350,000
of my show's budget

16:24.434 --> 16:26.701
into the anecdote I'd
be telling tonight,

16:26.768 --> 16:29.134
and that meant this had to work.

16:29.201 --> 16:31.568
But shortly after the show began,

16:31.634 --> 16:34.168
something happened
that I never saw coming.

16:34.234 --> 16:36.701
Please say hello to Kirsten Dunst.

16:36.768 --> 16:38.668
The first guest of the
night was Hollywood starlet

16:38.734 --> 16:41.668
Kirsten Dunst, and as she
began telling her story,

16:41.734 --> 16:43.534
I couldn't believe my ears.

16:43.601 --> 16:46.201
It started with talk
of an upcoming wedding.

16:46.268 --> 16:48.401
You got engaged since
the last time I saw you.

16:48.468 --> 16:50.534
I did, last December. Yeah.

16:50.601 --> 16:52.701
And then quickly
transitioned into a story

16:52.768 --> 16:54.868
about a luggage mix-up at an airport.

16:54.901 --> 16:56.601
She worked for Lufthansa.

16:56.668 --> 16:58.534
If someone was rude to
her in the morning...

16:58.601 --> 17:00.434
- She did it twice, I think.
- What'd she do?

17:00.501 --> 17:02.868
She would send their bag
to a different country.

17:04.634 --> 17:06.334
I couldn't believe what I was seeing,

17:06.401 --> 17:08.233
and just when I thought
it couldn't get worse...

17:08.300 --> 17:10.934
You know, you have movie
pot, which is basically fake.

17:11.001 --> 17:13.468
You know, it's like,
whatever they roll. Tobacco...

17:13.534 --> 17:14.667
- Oregano or whatever.
- Oregano, yeah.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.334
She ended with a twist

17:16.401 --> 17:18.434
about confusing a baggie of fake drugs

17:18.501 --> 17:19.601
for real drugs.

17:19.667 --> 17:21.068
He came back, he's like,

17:21.134 --> 17:22.867
"Oh, you smoked a full blunt

17:22.867 --> 17:24.001
on one of the takes."

17:24.068 --> 17:25.101
I've never been that stoned

17:25.167 --> 17:26.901
in my entire life.

17:26.968 --> 17:28.768
I considered just leaving right then.

17:28.868 --> 17:30.634
How could I possibly follow

17:30.701 --> 17:33.334
a story that was so similar to mine?

17:33.401 --> 17:36.068
But before I knew it, the
sound guy intercepted me,

17:36.134 --> 17:37.734
and all of a sudden, I was being ushered

17:37.868 --> 17:39.401
to the stage.

17:39.468 --> 17:41.234
I had no clue what would happen

17:41.301 --> 17:43.334
once I was out there, but at this point

17:43.401 --> 17:44.634
there was no turning back.

17:44.701 --> 17:46.568

18:07.434 --> 18:09.368
You got a lot of energy, Nathan.

18:09.434 --> 18:11.301
You remind me of a young George Lopez.

18:11.368 --> 18:13.368
Do you get that regularly?

18:13.434 --> 18:14.868
I love rock and roll.

18:16.868 --> 18:19.734
Couldn't help but jam a
little bit with you guys.

18:19.868 --> 18:21.668
I was still in a state of shock

18:21.734 --> 18:23.601
as I stumbled through the initial banter

18:23.668 --> 18:24.968
and began my story.

18:25.034 --> 18:26.501
So, okay, I was going to a wedding

18:26.568 --> 18:28.401
like, a out-of-town wedding. Okay.

18:28.468 --> 18:30.168
You've been to weddings before.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.501
- I was at one once, yeah.
- Yeah.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.501
And I could sense right away,

18:33.568 --> 18:36.501
the audience wasn't in the
mood for another wedding tale.

18:36.568 --> 18:40.034
But I knew I did have one
thing that Kirsten Dunst didn't:

18:40.101 --> 18:41.734
a funny visual.

18:41.868 --> 18:43.868
And I put on the suit,
but the only thing is,

18:43.868 --> 18:45.301
it's, uh...

18:45.368 --> 18:46.468
it's, like, way too big for me.

18:46.534 --> 18:48.134
Okay.

18:48.201 --> 18:50.268
Actually, I sent your
producers the photo.

18:50.334 --> 18:51.401
Oh, you have a photo?
Oh, how 'bout that?

18:51.468 --> 18:52.601
That's me in the hotel room.

18:52.668 --> 18:54.034
I took that. Uhhuh.

18:54.101 --> 18:55.534
Oh, yeah, that is...

18:57.101 --> 18:59.701
That is too big.

18:59.868 --> 19:01.568
That is just way too big.

19:01.634 --> 19:03.134
I look like a Dick Tracy
villain or something.

19:03.201 --> 19:05.334
Yeah.

19:05.401 --> 19:07.601
The explosion of laughter I
got gave me new confidence,

19:07.668 --> 19:10.234
and as I began
describing my drug mix-up,

19:10.301 --> 19:12.201
I was reminded that maybe

19:12.268 --> 19:15.101
the similarities in our
stories didn't matter.

19:15.168 --> 19:18.868
In the suit, there's
like, a small Ziploc baggie

19:18.868 --> 19:20.868
with, like, a powdery substance in it.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.434
Mm-hmm.

19:22.501 --> 19:24.068
Every great talk show anecdote

19:24.134 --> 19:26.068
follows the same formula.

19:26.134 --> 19:29.068
It didn't matter how many
times the audience had heard it.

19:29.134 --> 19:31.068
They wanted to hear it again.

19:31.134 --> 19:34.334
And I see the sirens, and, uh,

19:34.401 --> 19:36.001
a cop pulls me over.

19:36.068 --> 19:38.868
"Thank God, you're
not the fashion police,

19:38.934 --> 19:40.468
or I'd be in big trouble right now."

19:40.534 --> 19:43.101
I had left the baggie on the seat...

19:43.168 --> 19:44.934
- Oh.
- Beside me.

19:45.001 --> 19:47.534
Plot point after plot
point, I was killing.

19:47.601 --> 19:49.368
"Oh, I don't know, it's not mine."

19:51.301 --> 19:53.468
But as my story crossed
the nine-minute mark,

19:53.534 --> 19:55.868
I could tell they were
expecting a big payoff,

19:55.934 --> 19:57.668
and if I could stick the landing,

19:57.734 --> 19:59.134
this could go down

19:59.201 --> 20:01.001
as the best talk show anecdote

20:01.068 --> 20:02.434
of all time.

20:02.501 --> 20:06.134
And I give the phone to the cop.

20:06.201 --> 20:09.034
And the cop takes it and hesitates

20:09.101 --> 20:10.934
and puts it to his ear, and he's like,

20:11.001 --> 20:13.134
"What's in the baggie?"

20:13.201 --> 20:15.368
And then there's this long silence

20:15.434 --> 20:18.068
while the cop is just listening,

20:18.134 --> 20:21.368
and then he looks at the baggie again

20:21.434 --> 20:25.568
and then hands back the baggie
to me with my phone and says,

20:25.634 --> 20:27.568
"Okay. You're good."

20:29.301 --> 20:31.534
And so I say to him,

20:31.601 --> 20:33.901
I'm like, "What did he say..."

20:35.268 --> 20:36.768
"Was in the baggie?"

20:36.834 --> 20:40.068
And he said, "It's his mother's ashes."

20:43.134 --> 20:46.034
- So, you must've been...
- I mean...

20:50.001 --> 20:52.734
Firstly, I've never been so relieved

20:52.801 --> 20:56.034
to find out I was holding human remains.

20:58.101 --> 21:00.334
That night, I was incredible,

21:00.401 --> 21:01.968
and I could rest easy,

21:02.034 --> 21:03.934
knowing that it all really happened.

21:04.001 --> 21:06.501
Nathan Fielder, everybody!
We'll be right back.

21:06.568 --> 21:08.434
Ab-so-lutely.
