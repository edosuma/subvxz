01:25.686 --> 01:28.053

<i>the government today insisted</i>

01:30.491 --> 01:34.059

01:34.061 --> 01:35.694
<i>an action that</i>

01:35.696 --> 01:37.362
<i>will destroy</i>

<i> You can</i>

01:39.700 --> 01:45.437

01:45.439 --> 01:48.841
<i>"to be a party to the
greatest struggle on earth."</i>

01:48.843 --> 01:53.045
I left my number. Just in case.

01:53.047 --> 01:56.715
<i>Everything's at stake for me.</i>
<i>I'm 27 year old. Right?</i>

01:56.717 --> 01:58.217
Maybe see you on the march,
then?

01:58.219 --> 01:59.384
<i>I'm fighting for their</i>

01:59.386 --> 01:59.384

01:59.386 --> 02:02.621

<i>All we've got now is us pride</i>

02:04.692 --> 02:07.025
<i>and we'll carry</i>
<i>on keeping that.</i>

02:07.027 --> 02:09.561
<i>The prime minister
today defended her position.</i>

02:09.562 --> 02:11.463
<i>I can't change my style.</i>

02:11.465 --> 02:14.233
<i>It has to be a style</i>
<i>of firm leadership.</i>

02:14.235 --> 02:16.535
<i>One isn't here to be a softie.</i>

02:16.537 --> 02:19.104
<i>You're here to be a good,</i>
<i>firm leader.</i>

02:25.812 --> 02:26.945
Hey, mark,
do you want to play ball?

02:26.947 --> 02:28.046
Tomorrow, buddy.

02:28.648 --> 02:29.815
Here you go, mark.

02:29.817 --> 02:30.983
Great. Thanks.

02:30.985 --> 02:33.385
I've spoken to the council
about your deviant parties.

02:33.387 --> 02:36.121
There's no need to do that. Just
knock on the door, we'd let you in.

02:36.756 --> 02:38.090
They're sending a policeman.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.391
Oh, I do hope so.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.761
Mark.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.596
Thanks.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.098
<i>...The riot squad,</i>

02:46.100 --> 02:48.433
<i>the helmeted policemen</i>
<i>with their plastic shields,</i>

02:48.435 --> 02:51.436
<i>were deployed after smoke
bombs were thrown.</i>

02:51.438 --> 02:51.436
<i>The violence continued...</i>
Thanks, dad.

02:51.438 --> 02:56.542
<i>At one stage, the pickets nearly
broke through the police barricade.</i>

03:25.171 --> 03:27.139
Two, four, six, eight!

03:27.141 --> 03:29.441
Is that copper really straight?

03:29.443 --> 03:32.844
Two, four, six, eight! Is
that copper really straight?

03:32.846 --> 03:34.313
Two, four, six, eight!

03:34.315 --> 03:36.615
Is that copper really straight?

03:36.617 --> 03:40.319
Two, four, six, eight! Is
that copper really straight?

03:40.321 --> 03:42.387
Two, four, six, eight!

03:49.028 --> 03:51.129
Oi, grab hold of this,
will you, mate?

03:51.998 --> 03:53.332
Oh, no, sorry.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.400
Just for five minutes, till
me friends get here. Come on.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.303
It... it's just that I don't
really want to be too visible.

03:58.305 --> 03:59.471
Is it your first pride?

03:59.473 --> 04:00.872
Yeah, first anything.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.742
Yeah, well, this is the best way.
You need to throw yourself in.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.477
The thing is is that I'm
actually from bromley.

04:05.479 --> 04:08.013
Well, don't worry about that,
we're a broad church.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.214
No, I mean, it's the train.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.682
It's further out
than people think and I...

04:10.684 --> 04:13.051
Oi, I've been dragging
this thing on me own

04:13.053 --> 04:14.553
since marble arch.
What, are they buckets?

04:14.555 --> 04:16.688
Surprised you have to ask that question,
Mike, coming from accrington.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.223
Mike, does anything
get rid of love bites?

04:18.225 --> 04:20.158
Right, listen up, everyone.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.360
Where exactly have you been?

04:21.362 --> 04:23.362
I want everyone to take a
bucket and start rattling.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.896
This is for the miners. Miners?

04:24.898 --> 04:26.265
We agreed on a banner, mark.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.699
It's a show of solidarity.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.701
Who hates the miners? Thatcher.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.204
Who else? The police, the
public and the tabloid press.

04:32.206 --> 04:33.606
That sound familiar?
Surely, mark...

04:33.607 --> 04:36.908
The only problem we've got that
they haven't is Mary whitehouse.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.076
And that can only
be a matter of time.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.045
Mark...
I know, it's not been planned.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.728
It's not been thought through but
it's a really good idea, isn't it?

04:45.118 --> 04:47.019
Isn't it?

04:47.954 --> 04:49.221
What am I supposed
to do with this?

04:49.223 --> 04:50.589
Give it to the lesbians.
They love a banner.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.790
Oh, for God's sake.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.393
Right, looks like you're
off the hook, mate. Good lad.

04:54.395 --> 04:57.529
Whatever mark says, we do it.
Don't ask me why.

05:11.277 --> 05:13.178
Disgusting. Yes.

05:21.954 --> 05:26.058
We're collecting for the
miners and their families, guys.

05:26.060 --> 05:29.795
Gays and lesbians support the
miners and their families.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.931
I was wondering,
do you need a hand?

05:32.933 --> 05:35.300
Well, well,
if it isn't bromley.

05:35.302 --> 05:37.669
I mean, my last train
is actually not for ages.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.338
Gays and lesbians
support the miners.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.073
Gays and lesbians
support the miners.

05:41.075 --> 05:42.741
Gays and lesbians
support the miners.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.409
Support the miners.

05:44.411 --> 05:45.844
Guys, support the miners.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.513
Gays and lesbians
support the miners.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.415
Collecting for the miners.
Dig deep.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.651
Support the miners. Come on.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.987
Support the miners!
Support the miners!

06:01.527 --> 06:04.262
It's just a couple of
the lads from college

06:04.264 --> 06:06.131
and one of them
lives in chislehurst.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.834
<i>So he can't be too late, either.
I've got my key.</i>

06:08.836 --> 06:10.469
Just mind yourself
on that last train.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.270
There's weirdos and
all sorts on there.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.640
Thanks, mum.

06:21.447 --> 06:26.017
<i>¶ It makes none,</i>
<i>but now you have gone</i>

06:26.019 --> 06:30.622
<i>¶ and you must be</i>
<i>looking very old tonight</i>

06:31.858 --> 06:36.395
<i>¶ the devil will find work</i>
<i>for idle hands to do</i>

06:37.730 --> 06:43.335
<i>¶ I stole and I lied and why?</i>
<i>Because you asked me to</i>

06:43.337 --> 06:46.037
<i>¶ but now you make me</i>
<i>feel so ashamed</i>

06:46.039 --> 06:47.506
Oi, bromley.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.874
Over here.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.182
I'm hiding from that girl.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.483
Why?

06:58.485 --> 07:01.286
She broke my heart
at a smiths concert.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.556
I've never met
a lesbian before.

07:04.558 --> 07:07.993
Really? I've never met anyone
who irons their jeans.

07:11.365 --> 07:12.631
I live at home.

07:12.633 --> 07:13.865
No shit.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.500
Is that where you got
that lovely broach?

07:16.869 --> 07:19.004
That's embarrassing.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.173
It's today.

07:21.175 --> 07:22.307
What are you, 10?

07:23.342 --> 07:24.776
I'm 20.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.178
I wouldn't go
spreading that around.

07:27.246 --> 07:29.047
You're illegal, darling.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.750
Sixteen for the breeders,
21 for the gays.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.252
Did you learn
nothing on that march?

07:34.254 --> 07:35.854
You're still a minor.

07:37.056 --> 07:38.523
Jesus.

07:38.525 --> 07:39.958
Victory to the minors.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.460
Don't make a mess, okay?

07:41.462 --> 07:43.929
They've counted it.

07:43.931 --> 07:47.199
Well, come on, you've
collected as much as anyone.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.634
Stephanie.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.203
Were you with Jeff
in the bell last night?

07:51.205 --> 07:55.207
For fuck's sake. It's a bruise, okay?
My neck is bruised.

07:56.876 --> 08:00.312
No red wine on the
floor, please. Ashtrays.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.247
It
was a pretty good march today.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.449
Not much in the way
of beatings or abuse.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.618
Hardly any petrol bombs
or swastikas.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.320
Is it me or are
the police getting soft?

08:10.557 --> 08:12.023
It's funny.
They've stopped hanging

08:12.025 --> 08:13.425
around outside
our clubs lately.

08:13.427 --> 08:15.627
What's that about?

08:15.629 --> 08:17.796
Do you think they've finally got
sick of all that Donna summer?

08:18.966 --> 08:20.065
No, never!

08:20.067 --> 08:23.502
My guess is they
went somewhere else.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.505
To pick on someone else.

08:26.507 --> 08:29.908
My guess is that
while we're enjoying

08:29.910 --> 08:33.278
a temporary reprieve,
they're here.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.181
Giving these poor sods
the shit we usually get.

08:36.183 --> 08:40.852
Now, these mining communities are
being bullied just like we are.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.453
Right? Bullied by the police.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.489
Bullied by the tabloids.
Bullied by the government.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.657
Do any of them need a hug?

08:46.827 --> 08:49.160
No. What they need is cash,
and they need it urgently.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.363
Yeah, because the miners have always
come to our aid, haven't they?

08:51.365 --> 08:53.265
Are you fucking kidding me?

08:53.267 --> 08:55.133
Why don't we talk about today?

08:55.135 --> 08:59.971
Today, with only a couple of
buckets, we raised nearly 200 quid.

08:59.973 --> 09:03.041
Right, think what we could achieve
if we really started trying.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.476
I'm from durham.

09:04.478 --> 09:06.344
Well, you know exactly what
we're talking about, then.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.480
I know those bastards
kicked the shit out of me

09:08.482 --> 09:11.449
every morning on
my way to school

09:11.451 --> 09:13.852
and every night on my way home.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.896
We are proposing to
meet at least once a week.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.731
And just to do
as many collections as we can.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.100
Oh, and...
And we've got a name.

09:30.703 --> 09:33.238
Lgsm.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.874
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.075
It's not very catchy.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.144
It's a support group, Steph,
not a skiffle band.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.146
Right, come on. Let's have
a show of hands, shall we?

09:41.148 --> 09:42.981
Who's in? Guys?

09:44.718 --> 09:46.384
Come on, guys, please.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.186
Oh, come on, guys.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.821
Is that it?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.156
We've actually been
looking for things

09:51.158 --> 09:53.091
that we could do together
as a... as a couple.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.225
Well, this is perfect.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.894
Youse can feed the miners
and your relationship.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.363
How many's that? That's six.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.365
It's better than five.
Not as good as seven.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.900
Jonathan.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.368
Oh, God.
Here come the gay libbers.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.570
Brilliant party, geth.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.105
I'm sure you could use
the back room here

10:07.107 --> 10:08.740
if you're looking
for a base, that is.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.443
We are... uh, we are. That's
amazing, gethin, thank you.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.111
Well,
what about me and Jonathan?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.347
Or is it exclusively
for the under-25s?

10:15.349 --> 10:17.082
Oh, no, of course not.
Everyone's welcome.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.284
<i>¶ touch me,
baby, tainted love ¶</i>

10:19.286 --> 10:20.852
are you sure
Jonathan's interested?

10:26.692 --> 10:28.360
He's at a bit of a loose end
at the moment.

10:28.362 --> 10:31.262
He just needs something
to occupy him. A project.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.698
What about
bromley over there?

10:33.700 --> 10:35.967
I've... I've just started
catering college.

10:35.969 --> 10:39.404
Good.
Congratulations, all of you.

10:39.406 --> 10:42.607
You're the founder members of
lesbians and gays support the miners.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.609
Terrific. Let's bring
down the government.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.116
Support for the miners.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.417
Give generously.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.486
Put your hand in your pockets
for the miners.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.454
Lesbians and gays
support the miners!

10:57.990 --> 10:59.457
<i>National
union of mine workers.</i>

10:59.459 --> 11:01.559
Oh, hello. I represent a group

11:01.561 --> 11:03.962
called lesbians and gays
support the miners and...

11:05.332 --> 11:07.832
Hello? Hello...

11:10.903 --> 11:12.771
And there's
the desired consistency.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.340
It's glossy and wobbly.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.542
Glossy and wobbly.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.650
Jonathan.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.652
Why don't you go
out with them today?

11:27.654 --> 11:28.953
Because I've got
better things to do

11:28.955 --> 11:31.489
than run around
with a bunch of kids.

11:33.492 --> 11:35.660
What happened to
gay lib, Jonathan?

11:35.662 --> 11:38.329
I don't know.
What did happen to it?

11:39.765 --> 11:41.366
Is that gethin's boyfriend?

11:41.368 --> 11:44.335
Jonathan. He stabbed susannah
York with an ice pick.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.440
He's an actor.

11:48.442 --> 11:49.607
Support the miners.

11:49.609 --> 11:52.310
Lesbians and gays
support the miners, sir.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.212
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.381
We've raised money and we're looking
for a mining community to...

11:56.383 --> 11:57.949
<i>Repeat the
name of the group, please?</i>

11:57.951 --> 11:59.451
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

11:59.453 --> 12:01.653
<i>Somebody will call you
back in due course.</i>

12:01.655 --> 12:04.556
Sure, but you've said
that before and we...

12:07.727 --> 12:09.861
They'll call back.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.964
They will.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.934
Mark, face it.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.368
They're on strike.
They're busy.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.970
They don't want to take our
money because we're poofs.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.972
And a dyke.
They'd rather starve.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.807
Maybe we should just hand
the money over anonymously.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.342
I mean, we don't have to
say we're gay, do we?

12:24.344 --> 12:25.410
No.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.478
Well, at least then
we'd be helping.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.012
No, this is a gay
and lesbian group

12:28.014 --> 12:30.348
and we are unapologetic
about that.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.050
Jesus, why are you even
wasting time with all this?

12:32.052 --> 12:33.718
Mark. They will call us back.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.186
It has nothing to do with
the fact that we're poofs.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.888
And a dyke.
They will call us back.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.490
End of meeting.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.227
They're never
going to call us back.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.628
Someone needs to go with him.

12:45.364 --> 12:46.498
First rule of the group.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.599
I'll go.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.900
Thank you, Steph.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.270
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.272
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.707
Pervert!

12:55.709 --> 12:59.577
First rule of the group, comrade.
Nobody collects alone.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.280
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.050
Lesbians and gays support...

13:06.052 --> 13:07.218
Gethin.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.686
Gethin, come on. You're
supposed to be a bookshop.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.522
We don't have maps, mark.
It's a gay bookshop.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.724
People ask for the poems
of Walt Whitman.

13:12.726 --> 13:13.858
I hope there's
a good reason why

13:13.860 --> 13:13.858
I've been abandoned
in the street?

13:13.860 --> 13:17.595
Let me just get this right, so we
are going to pick a mining town

13:17.597 --> 13:20.064
completely at random and just ring
it, is that the plan, is it, mark?

13:20.066 --> 13:21.266
Yeah, the town hall,
the council.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.400
What, it's as easy as that?

13:22.402 --> 13:24.736
Why not? We bypass the
union all together.

13:24.738 --> 13:26.437
I think it's inspired. So do I.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.672
See? Even bromley agrees.

13:27.674 --> 13:28.873
Right, here we go.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.644
A-ha.
So, what do we want? Um...

13:32.646 --> 13:34.212
Somewhere north... Industrial?

13:34.214 --> 13:35.747
Humberside. Is...
Is that a place?

13:35.749 --> 13:38.082
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Give it to me.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.618
If it's miners
you're looking for...

13:40.620 --> 13:41.920
There. Wales.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.154
Of course.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.123
That's a big fucking coalfield.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.025
That's the brecon beacons.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.764
That's a coalfield, there.
And that is.

13:52.766 --> 13:54.165
All right, and what are
we supposed to do?

13:54.167 --> 13:55.767
Stick a bloody pin in it?
Do you know people, gethin?

13:55.769 --> 13:58.069
No, I haven't been
back there in 16 years.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.671
Why not?

13:59.673 --> 14:01.406
Well,
let's just say there isn't

14:01.408 --> 14:03.107
always a welcome
in the hillsides.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.743
Shall I get you the phone book?

14:05.745 --> 14:08.313
Well, what's the worst
that can happen?

14:08.315 --> 14:10.915
Oh, hello. I represent a bunch
of screaming homosexuals.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.350
May I inquire
about your communal baths?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.352
What's that
got to do with a strike?

14:14.354 --> 14:15.753
Nothing.
I'd just like to inquire.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.960
All right, all right. Thank you.
All right. Oi!

14:21.962 --> 14:24.603
If we're going to do this, we need
to take it seriously. Come here.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.767
Right.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.604
0-1-9...

14:37.443 --> 14:39.043
What's the welsh for lesbian?

15:07.239 --> 15:08.473
Hello?

15:10.309 --> 15:11.442
Yes.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.921
I see.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.493
Yes!

15:28.495 --> 15:31.496
<i>¶ Solidarity forever</i>

15:31.498 --> 15:35.600
<i>¶ solidarity forever</i>

15:35.602 --> 15:40.071
<i>¶ solidarity forever ¶</i>

15:40.073 --> 15:41.773
it really didn't occur to
you to get a description?

15:41.775 --> 15:43.341
Well, she were off
the phone that fast.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.276
Maybe we should try and
look more obviously gay.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.679
Achievable goals, please, Jeff.

15:47.681 --> 15:50.248
- Shut up. That's him.
- Are you sure?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.916
Oh, my God,
he's coming towards us.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.151
How did you know it were him?

15:53.153 --> 15:54.385
It's the same
as in a nightclub.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.486
It's all in the eyes.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.554
I'm dai Donovan.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.222
From the dulais valley. Right.

15:58.224 --> 15:59.757
You must be mark. Yes, hello.

15:59.759 --> 16:00.825
Hiya. Mike.

16:00.827 --> 16:01.893
Steph.

16:01.895 --> 16:03.428
Hello. Joe.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.229
Jeff. Dai.

16:05.231 --> 16:09.767
So, lgsm. What does
that stand for, then?

16:11.603 --> 16:14.639
You get a garbled message
over the phone.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.873
I thought the I was for London.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.377
London something.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.913
I never dreamed for a moment
it was I for...

16:21.915 --> 16:22.415
Hi.

16:24.783 --> 16:28.720
This money you've raised, it's
all from gays and lesbians?

16:28.722 --> 16:31.189
Mostly, yeah.

16:31.724 --> 16:35.493
Right. There we are.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.894
This is just the beginning. Oh?

16:36.896 --> 16:38.997
Wife-hmm. We've got big plans.

16:38.999 --> 16:43.167
Well, I'm not going to pretend I'm
not surprised. You can see that.

16:43.169 --> 16:47.138
Truth told, you're the first
gays I've ever met in my life.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.007
As far as you're aware.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.275
That's true.

16:51.277 --> 16:52.944
And you're the first miner
I've ever met.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.246
Yeah.

16:59.118 --> 17:01.152
Now, I... I want you
to do something for me.

17:01.154 --> 17:04.589
I want you to go back to your
community and convey my thanks.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.290
My personal thanks.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.291
And the thanks
of all the people of dulais.

17:08.294 --> 17:11.029
Yeah, of course we will.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.195
Yeah.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.265
Yeah, yeah.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.334
Won't we, mark?

17:18.837 --> 17:20.505
Who fancies a pint?

17:24.843 --> 17:28.311
<i>¶ I'm the shy boy,</i>
<i>you're the coy boy</i>

17:28.314 --> 17:32.050
<i>¶ and you know</i>
<i>we're homosapien, too... ¶</i>

17:32.052 --> 17:34.152
you can have five minutes.
Are you sure about this?

17:34.154 --> 17:36.020
Dead sure. Yeah, but for dai...

17:36.022 --> 17:37.522
Oh, I'm all right, lad.

17:37.524 --> 17:38.990
Trust me, dai,
if you can handle this,

17:38.992 --> 17:40.825
it's going to make
a huge difference.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.628
What's he going to do,
take his clothes off?

17:43.630 --> 17:44.896
I'm just going
to say thank you.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.964
Well, don't blame me
if you get bottled.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.007
<i>Right, shut up, you fuckers.</i>

17:56.009 --> 17:57.875
Ooh...

17:57.877 --> 18:01.212
<i>Thank you. Right, listen.</i>
<i>Some of you know me.</i>

18:01.214 --> 18:03.681
<i>My name is mark Ashton.</i> Commie!

18:03.683 --> 18:05.817
<i>I'm going to invite somebody</i>
<i>onto the stage now</i>

18:05.819 --> 18:09.353
<i>who wants to talk to you and
I want you to listen to him.</i>

18:09.355 --> 18:14.258
<i>He comes from the dulais valley
in South wales and he, um...</i>

18:14.260 --> 18:16.861
<i>Well, he's a striking miner</i>

18:16.863 --> 18:19.397
<i>and he has something</i>
<i>he wants to say to you.</i>

18:26.940 --> 18:28.439
<i> I've had a...</i>

18:30.509 --> 18:35.446
<i>I've had a lot of new
experiences during this strike.</i>

18:35.448 --> 18:37.715
<i>Um, speaking in public.</i>

18:37.717 --> 18:39.851
<i>Standing on a picket line.</i>

18:40.719 --> 18:43.087
<i>And now I'm in a... A gay bar.</i>

18:43.089 --> 18:45.256
Well, if you don't like it,
you can go home.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.293
<i>As a matter of fact,</i>
<i>I do like it.</i>

18:49.295 --> 18:50.895
Ooh.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.396
<i>Beer's a bit expensive, mind.</i>

18:54.601 --> 18:57.568
<i>But really,</i>
<i>there's only one difference</i>

18:57.570 --> 19:00.605
<i>between this and a bar</i>
<i>in South wales.</i>

19:01.473 --> 19:02.874
<i>The women.</i>

19:04.476 --> 19:06.043
<i>They're a lot more</i>
<i>feminine in here.</i>

19:10.082 --> 19:13.684
<i>What I'd really like to say</i>
<i>to you tonight is thank you.</i>

19:15.387 --> 19:19.457
<i>If you're one of the people that's
put money in these buckets,</i>

19:19.459 --> 19:22.827
<i>if you've supported lgsm,</i>
<i>then thank you,</i>

19:24.963 --> 19:30.134
<i>because what you've given us is
more than money, it's friendship.</i>

19:30.185 --> 19:31.837
<i>And when you're in a battle</i>

19:31.838 --> 19:38.309
<i>against an enemy so much bigger,
so much stronger than you,</i>

19:38.311 --> 19:42.180
<i>well, to find out you had a
friend you never knew existed,</i>

19:43.949 --> 19:46.817
<i>well, that's the best feeling</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

19:46.819 --> 19:48.653
<i>So, thank you.</i>

20:00.098 --> 20:01.999
<i>¶ When two tribes go to war</i>

20:02.001 --> 20:05.102
<i>¶ a point is all</i>
<i>that you can score ¶</i>

20:05.104 --> 20:07.004
oh, my God. I haven't
even finished this one.

20:08.507 --> 20:10.227
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

20:11.843 --> 20:13.945
Support the miners.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.781
So you're the only girl?

20:16.783 --> 20:19.517
That's right.
I'm the I in lgsm.

20:24.523 --> 20:25.756
Good speech.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.191
Thank you. Thank you very much.

20:27.193 --> 20:29.994
I've worked a few tough
crowds myself over the years.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.696
In politics? In panto.

20:31.698 --> 20:32.797
Oh, right.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.232
Okay, lgsm, over here, please.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.800
That's something else we could use.
What's that?

20:35.802 --> 20:37.335
An official photographer.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.637
Jesus, mark. We don't even
have an official typewriter.

20:39.639 --> 20:40.871
Nice and close, please.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.039
I could do it.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.307
I've got a camera.

20:43.309 --> 20:45.009
It's a really good one.
I'd be happy to do it.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.477
All right, bromley,
if you're sure.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.912
Course he's sure.

20:47.914 --> 20:51.182
Never let it be said that lgsm
discouraged youth enterprise.

20:51.184 --> 20:52.750
Right, then. What are you
going to say, "cheese"?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.585
Victory to the miners!

20:54.587 --> 20:57.054
Victory to the miners!

21:07.399 --> 21:09.100
Martin, come on.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.403
Tell them you've run
a whole canteen before.

21:12.405 --> 21:13.804
You're not just
packing food parcels.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.206
Go.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.607
And don't look
so bloody worried.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.676
It's not
the first day of school.

21:32.090 --> 21:35.526
What do they need to come here for?
We sent them a thank-you note.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.228
Every other support group
has been invited.

21:37.230 --> 21:38.629
Every other support group was

21:38.631 --> 21:39.964
approved by
the whole committee.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.332
Oh, I see.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.633
Dai had to make
a snap decision.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.235
This is all my fault.

21:44.237 --> 21:45.436
He was in London, Maureen.

21:45.438 --> 21:46.937
What would you have done?
Told them to keep their money?

21:46.939 --> 21:48.205
I'll tell you exactly
what I would have done...

21:48.207 --> 21:49.807
But they raised the money.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.375
All right,
I run a civil meeting here.

21:51.377 --> 21:54.111
If you want to scream and
shout, get on the pickets.

21:54.113 --> 21:58.149
I don't have a problem
with what they are.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.417
None of us do.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.618
It's the men.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.520
Well, you bring a load of gays

22:02.522 --> 22:04.488
into a working men's club,
you get trouble.

22:04.490 --> 22:05.556
I'm sorry.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.325
No other group
has raised as much money.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.592
I'm not disputing that.

22:08.594 --> 22:09.827
Or been so consistent.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.463
Then why don't you
just invite them?

22:13.965 --> 22:16.100
I'm sorry, but everyone's saying
they don't have a problem.

22:16.102 --> 22:19.337
Good, they've raised the
most money, so invite them.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.339
And who the bloody hell
are you?

22:23.008 --> 22:24.004
You did what?

22:24.030 --> 22:25.076
I know.

22:25.078 --> 22:29.313
But hefina, she's like the head
honcho, absolutely terrifying,

22:29.315 --> 22:31.649
well, she obviously
can't stand this Maureen.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.651
Kids, mind the fish fingers.

22:39.324 --> 22:41.959
What's the matter? You told
me not to sell myself short.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.929
I'm not talking about that.
Gays and lesbians!

22:44.931 --> 22:46.464
We're trying to
fit in here, sian.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.531
What?

22:47.533 --> 22:50.000
Volunteer, I said.
Run the canteen.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.469
They didn't want me
on the canteen.

22:51.471 --> 22:52.870
They wanted me
on the committee.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.106
All right, so keep your head down.
Do the paperwork.

22:55.108 --> 22:57.041
Don't start stirring it all up,

22:57.043 --> 22:58.943
inviting a load of
gays and lesbians.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.811
Oh, it's like that, is it?

23:00.813 --> 23:02.246
You know, I had you
down as many things

23:02.248 --> 23:03.614
but prejudiced was
never one of them.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.216
I'm not prejudiced. No?

23:05.218 --> 23:08.319
I'm a realist. I know what
small towns are like, sian.

23:08.321 --> 23:10.454
And I know exactly how those
lads are going to react.

23:10.456 --> 23:11.956
You think so? I know so.

23:11.958 --> 23:15.526
I'm standing on a bloody picket
with them day after day.

23:15.528 --> 23:19.697
It was a majority decision.
The committee decided.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.699
Well, I hope you
and your bloody committee

23:21.701 --> 23:25.102
can guarantee their safety,
sian, I do, I really do.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.310
All aboard the deviants bus.

23:33.312 --> 23:36.347
No pushing,
no community singing.

23:36.349 --> 23:40.818
And absolutely
no back-chatting the driver.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.019
Right, where are we going?

23:42.021 --> 23:43.120
Wales.

23:44.589 --> 23:48.225
Fuck me. Someone better roll
me a little spliffette.

23:48.227 --> 23:51.862
What I'd like to know is what
bromley told his mum and dad.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.063
Yeah.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.365
I just... Oh, it's no big deal.

23:54.367 --> 23:56.100
Come on.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.369
I said that
I was doing so well at college

23:58.371 --> 24:00.604
they were sending me
on a residential course.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.440
Doing what?

24:03.675 --> 24:05.543
Choux pastry.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.447
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

24:09.449 --> 24:12.516
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

24:12.518 --> 24:15.186
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

24:33.405 --> 24:35.639
Bit late in the day
for that, isn't it?

24:35.641 --> 24:37.475
That's the fourth one
I've done.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.610
Fast as I put them up,
they pull 'em down.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.779
I'm running out of staples.

24:58.396 --> 25:02.433
<i>¶ Every woman is</i>
<i>a lesbian at heart</i>

25:02.435 --> 25:05.669
<i>¶ every woman is</i>
<i>a lesbian at heart... ¶</i>

25:05.671 --> 25:08.305
you can't possibly say
that every woman is a lesbian.

25:08.573 --> 25:09.807
Why not?

25:09.809 --> 25:11.041
'Cause they're not.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.611
Esther rantzen isn't a lesbian.
My mum's not a lesbian.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.446
How do you know?

25:15.448 --> 25:16.680
How do I know my mum's
not a lesbian?

25:16.682 --> 25:19.250
What he's trying
to say is you can't

25:19.252 --> 25:21.752
make grand,
sweeping generalizations.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.554
It's not acceptable.

25:25.323 --> 25:29.159
<i>¶ Every woman is</i>
<i>a lesbian at heart</i>

25:29.161 --> 25:32.863
<i>¶ every woman is</i>
<i>a lesbian at heart</i>

25:32.865 --> 25:36.000
<i>¶ every woman is</i>
<i>a lesbian at heart</i>

25:36.002 --> 25:39.937
<i>¶ including Reggie's mum ¶</i>

26:43.234 --> 26:46.437
Look at the map. We should
have turned left at that village.

26:46.439 --> 26:48.959
How can that be a village?
It doesn't have any vowels.

26:53.378 --> 26:55.946
- Hang on a minute.
- Yes?

26:56.781 --> 26:58.349
I think so.

26:58.351 --> 26:59.817
Are we here?

27:00.919 --> 27:02.353
We're here.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.193
Oh, my God.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.763
Come on, let's go.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.955
Right, then.

27:56.241 --> 27:57.408
I guess we just...

27:57.410 --> 28:00.310
I think I'm starting
to freak out slightly.

28:06.184 --> 28:09.386
Dai, your gays have arrived.

28:20.799 --> 28:21.965
Good to see you again.

28:21.967 --> 28:23.200
Good to see you.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.804
Hi, there. Welcome. Welcome.
Come on in, everybody.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.926
Great to see you again.
Great to see you again. Hello.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.275
Come on in.

28:31.277 --> 28:34.378
Welcome, everybody.
This is my wife, Margaret.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.713
Hello. How are you?

28:35.715 --> 28:39.183
This is Gail and sian,
who wrote to you.

28:39.185 --> 28:42.453
This is hefina, who chairs
the welfare committee.

28:42.455 --> 28:46.690
This is Gwen, and this is
cliff, our club secretary.

28:46.692 --> 28:49.326
Um, I'm going to officiate you.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.661
Oh, good.

28:52.664 --> 28:55.265
Hold that and
name here, please...

28:55.267 --> 28:56.767
wife-hmm.

28:56.769 --> 29:00.838
And in the corresponding box, the
group or organization you represent.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.006
In this case...

29:03.008 --> 29:04.475
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

29:04.477 --> 29:05.943
Yep. Quite. Absolutely.

29:06.444 --> 29:07.511
Thank you.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.079
Thank you very much
for having us.

29:09.081 --> 29:12.382
Now, I'm hoping you can clear
something up for me about lesbians.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.017
Not now, Gwen.
It's something I was told

29:14.019 --> 29:15.319
in the covered market

29:15.321 --> 29:17.521
and to be honest with you,
it did surprise me.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.389
Let them get settled
in first, shall we?

29:19.824 --> 29:21.325
Oh.

29:21.327 --> 29:22.626
Now, who's making the speech?

29:23.094 --> 29:24.428
A... a speech?

29:24.430 --> 29:25.829
It's no big deal.

29:25.831 --> 29:28.098
One of you just has to go up
on stage and say a few words.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.466
Just so we know
who you are, like.

29:30.902 --> 29:34.338
I'll tell the band to shut up
and we'll push you on.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.373
And welcome, all of you.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.910
To be honest,
I never thought you'd come.

29:51.122 --> 29:54.491
Anybody else feel like
appointing themselves leader?

29:55.794 --> 29:57.795
Didn't think so.

30:04.435 --> 30:09.940
<i>¶ Many Miles from home</i>

30:09.942 --> 30:13.811
<i>¶ but I'm walking, walking</i>

30:13.813 --> 30:18.982
<i>¶ walking for you</i>

30:18.984 --> 30:23.887
<i>¶ walking for you ¶</i>

30:31.830 --> 30:34.498
<i>now, then,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

30:34.500 --> 30:37.968
<i>We're joined once again</i>
<i>by one of our support groups,</i>

30:38.970 --> 30:40.904
<i>lesbians and gays</i>
<i>support the miners.</i>

30:42.674 --> 30:47.177
<i>Will you welcome their spokesman
onto the stage? Thank you.</i>

30:53.351 --> 30:55.118
<i>Thank you, dai.</i>

30:55.120 --> 30:58.088
<i>Thank you, um...</i>
<i>Falling leaves.</i>

31:00.658 --> 31:03.627
<i>Actually, dai Donovan</i>
<i>made a speech at our local pub</i>

31:03.629 --> 31:06.129
<i>and he's a pretty</i>
<i>tough act to follow,</i>

31:06.131 --> 31:10.234
<i>so maybe now is the moment for my
musical tribute to Judy garland.</i>

31:13.037 --> 31:16.573
<i>Look, we raised this money</i>
<i>because we want to help you.</i>

31:17.375 --> 31:19.176
<i>And that's it.</i>

31:19.178 --> 31:23.280
<i>And we'll keep on trying to help
you for as long as you want us to</i>

31:23.282 --> 31:24.514
<i>because we've been through</i>

31:24.516 --> 31:26.317
<i>some of the same things</i>
<i>you've been through.</i>

31:31.656 --> 31:33.490
<i>Listen,</i>
<i>if one in five people is gay,</i>

31:33.492 --> 31:35.459
<i>then one in five miners</i>
<i>must be, too, right?</i>

31:37.128 --> 31:39.930
<i>So that's at least a fifth of
you who's pleased to see us.</i>

31:44.302 --> 31:47.471
<i>Thank you. Thank you
for inviting us here.</i>

31:47.473 --> 31:49.072
<i>Thanks.</i>

31:54.913 --> 31:56.480
One, two, three, four...

31:56.482 --> 32:00.684
<i>¶ Them falling leaves,</i>
<i>they say that summer's done</i>

32:00.686 --> 32:04.755
<i>¶ the wind and rains,</i>
<i>they say so too</i>

32:04.757 --> 32:08.926
<i>¶ but ain't no winter skies'll</i>

32:08.928 --> 32:10.894
<i>¶ while I'm with you ¶</i>

32:10.896 --> 32:11.995
night, everybody.

32:11.997 --> 32:13.063
Goodnight, dai.

32:24.042 --> 32:27.411
There we are. All settled in.

32:29.714 --> 32:32.015
It's teething problems, love.

32:32.017 --> 32:34.284
Everything will be all right
once they start to mix.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.300
I'm not talking
about running away.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.570
I'm talking about
making a dignified exit.

32:53.572 --> 32:54.972
Tomorrow before dawn?

32:54.974 --> 32:56.306
We can't just waltz
into a town like this

32:56.308 --> 32:57.607
and expect them not to...

32:57.609 --> 32:58.742
Slit our throats?

32:58.744 --> 32:59.810
Just be cautious.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.144
I don't know about anybody else

33:01.146 --> 33:03.480
but I don't have to travel to
wales to get my head kicked in.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.248
I can very easily
get that at home.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.984
Anyone who wants
to go should go.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.052
But I came here to help. Yeah,
but they don't want your help.

33:09.054 --> 33:11.054
Well, they can tell
me that to my face.

33:11.056 --> 33:12.990
Until that time,
I'm a member of lgsm

33:12.992 --> 33:14.891
and I'm going to do
what I set out to do.

33:14.893 --> 33:18.328
No hiding, no running away,
no apologies.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.529
Me, too.

33:19.531 --> 33:20.664
Yeah.

33:20.666 --> 33:21.865
And me.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.033
And me.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.142
This is a welsh castle, mind.

33:32.144 --> 33:34.678
None of your Norman rubbish.

33:34.680 --> 33:40.250
According to legend, the
maiden Sabrina came here, see,

33:40.252 --> 33:43.954
and became the goddess
of the river severn.

33:43.956 --> 33:45.589
How'd she manage that,
then, cliff?

33:45.591 --> 33:47.791
By drowning.

33:47.793 --> 33:51.028
"Sabrina fair
listen where thou art sitting

33:51.030 --> 33:53.697
"under the glassie, cool,
translucent wave"

33:53.699 --> 33:55.432
and so on.

33:56.634 --> 33:58.201
I grew up in northern Ireland.

33:58.203 --> 34:00.670
I know all about what happens when
people don't talk to each other.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.806
That's why I've
never understood,

34:02.808 --> 34:04.975
what's the point
of supporting gay rights

34:04.977 --> 34:07.644
but nobody else's rights,
you know?

34:07.646 --> 34:09.513
Or workers' rights
but not women's rights.

34:09.514 --> 34:12.815
It's...
I don't know, illogical.

34:12.818 --> 34:17.120
There's a lodge banner down in
the welfare, over 100 years old.

34:17.121 --> 34:19.489
We bring it out for special
occasions, you know.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.024
I'll show it to you one day.

34:21.025 --> 34:22.958
It's a symbol, like this.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.228
Right? Two hands.

34:25.230 --> 34:28.130
That's what the labor movement means.
Should mean.

34:28.132 --> 34:30.233
You support me, I support you.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.469
Whoever you are.
Wherever you come from.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.971
Shoulder to shoulder.
Hand to hand.

34:35.406 --> 34:37.541
Dai!

34:38.876 --> 34:41.378
There they go.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.780
They're bringing them in from
London, from Bristol. All over.

34:44.982 --> 34:47.684
They're pulling the
lads in for anything now.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.152
Well, they can't do that.

34:49.154 --> 34:52.155
There's two from my street in
custody right now. Lee and Carl.

34:52.157 --> 34:54.091
Where's your humanity?

34:54.092 --> 34:56.993
We're citizens of this country, mind.
Citizens.

34:56.995 --> 34:59.496
No, I mean, they can't do that.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.565
It's totally illegal.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.568
A police officer has
the right to stop you

35:04.570 --> 35:06.236
if, and that's
the important word here,

35:06.238 --> 35:07.904
if he has reasonable
grounds to believe

35:07.906 --> 35:09.506
a crime is going
to be committed.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.374
Now, you're absolutely
sure about this?

35:11.376 --> 35:13.443
Police harassment, dear.
I could set it to music.

35:13.445 --> 35:14.678
And if he does?

35:14.680 --> 35:16.113
Then he must
formally charge you

35:16.115 --> 35:17.514
within 24 hours of that arrest.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.349
But "reasonable grounds"
means concrete evidence

35:19.351 --> 35:21.284
that can stand up in court.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.520
It doesn't mean he doesn't
like the look of you.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.589
That's the same whether you're
standing on a picket line

35:25.591 --> 35:28.859
or trolling down clapham
high street in full drag.

35:28.861 --> 35:30.927
Hefina,
tell Martin to mind the kids.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.562
Where you going?

35:32.564 --> 35:34.131
The police station.

35:34.133 --> 35:36.466
She's finding her feet.

35:37.201 --> 35:39.136
Right, gentlemen, listen to me.

35:39.138 --> 35:42.405
A police officer only has the right
to detain a group of people...

35:42.407 --> 35:44.641
You need evidence
to stand up in a court of law.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.076
They need concrete evidence.

35:46.078 --> 35:47.444
If you keep them
for longer than 24 hours...

35:47.446 --> 35:49.746
No proof. No proof.

35:49.748 --> 35:52.883
And I will not be leaving
this desk until you do.

35:55.953 --> 35:58.355
We've got all day,
so chop-chop.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.092
Nobody said anything
about hiding who we are.

36:02.094 --> 36:04.427
Yes, they did. You.

36:04.429 --> 36:06.830
I just think if everybody
takes it easy on the...

36:06.832 --> 36:08.098
Flamboyance.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.566
Then we're more
likely to fit in.

36:09.568 --> 36:13.570
I'm sorry, just to be clear, when
you say flamboyance, you mean gay?

36:13.572 --> 36:15.505
And when you say everyone,
you mean me?

36:15.507 --> 36:17.007
Jonathan. Good.

36:17.009 --> 36:20.343
It's just I haven't spoken
1950s in quite a while.

36:35.126 --> 36:37.060
Over here, please.
We're packing parcels.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.398
You'll stay for a pint?

36:41.400 --> 36:42.766
No, you're all right, cliff.

36:42.768 --> 36:45.802
Welfare's had a change of atmosphere,
if you know what I mean.

36:45.804 --> 36:47.170
I don't know what
you mean, Lee, no.

36:47.172 --> 36:48.939
He means these faggots. Oi.

36:48.941 --> 36:50.507
If it wasn't for
those people over there,

36:50.509 --> 36:51.675
you lot would
still be in the Nick.

36:51.677 --> 36:52.842
What? He's right.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.678
They make me sick,
that's all I know, dai.

36:54.680 --> 36:55.812
That's enough.

36:55.814 --> 36:56.880
Physically sick.

37:01.619 --> 37:02.886
From London.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.387
They were the ones, Carl.
They got you out.

37:04.389 --> 37:05.822
I thought sian got us out.

37:05.824 --> 37:08.758
They told her...
They told her what to say.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.699
Carl. It's you lot, is it?
The gays.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.434
What's going on?

37:17.436 --> 37:19.169
No, it's all right.
It's all right.

37:19.171 --> 37:22.505
We're lgsm. Lesbians and gays
support the miners, yes.

37:22.507 --> 37:24.608
My name's mark Ashton.

37:27.144 --> 37:29.713
You'll have a pint,
will you, mark?

37:41.093 --> 37:45.161
What I was told about
lesbians really did shock me.

37:45.163 --> 37:47.230
It can't be true, can it?

37:47.232 --> 37:49.199
You're all vegetarians?

37:50.234 --> 37:52.836
Actually,
Zoe and I are both vegans.

37:59.010 --> 38:02.779
So, you live together like,
you know, husband and wife.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.581
But what I want to know is...

38:04.583 --> 38:06.349
I know what
you're going to say.

38:06.351 --> 38:09.619
Which one does the housework?

38:09.621 --> 38:14.024
Oh, well, that's... That's not what
I thought you was going to say.

38:14.026 --> 38:16.026
Are you joking? Certainly not.

38:16.028 --> 38:17.560
It's embarrassing
enough they spend

38:17.562 --> 38:19.029
one night on
dai's floor, Maureen.

38:19.031 --> 38:20.397
From here on in
the hosting committee's

38:20.399 --> 38:21.731
going to bloody
well start hosting.

38:21.733 --> 38:25.368
I'm sorry, not me.
I'm concerned about aids.

38:25.370 --> 38:26.903
What?

38:26.905 --> 38:30.807
It's not a trivial matter, sian.
They've issued leaflets.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.475
I don't mind
taking more, hefina.

38:32.477 --> 38:35.412
Not the lesbians so much
because of their cuisine.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.814
But I'll take an extra gay.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.317
I tell you something right
now, Maureen Barry,

38:40.319 --> 38:43.820
if you get aids, so help me
God, I'll nurse you myself.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.922
Though how you're going to get aids
from a couple of sleeping bags

38:45.924 --> 38:48.224
in your extension,
I don't know.

38:48.226 --> 38:49.459
Listen, it's fine.

38:49.461 --> 38:52.295
No. I can take another
one and so can cliff.

39:00.104 --> 39:01.971
Think it's going to be
that easy, do you?

39:01.973 --> 39:03.306
You just bulldoze
the whole village

39:03.308 --> 39:04.674
into thinking
the same thing as you.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.376
I don't need to
bulldoze anyone.

39:06.378 --> 39:08.011
It's you who's got the problem.

39:08.013 --> 39:11.314
They're all in there
getting along perfectly well.

39:15.586 --> 39:17.087
Oh, really?

39:33.337 --> 39:34.804
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

39:34.806 --> 39:37.140
I'm just talking to
kev about something.

39:37.142 --> 39:38.508
You can talk to kev
any day of the week.

39:38.510 --> 39:41.111
Get over there and find
a gay or a lesbian right now.

39:41.113 --> 39:45.148
Look, hefina, I've shaken their hands.
I've bought them a pint, see?

39:45.150 --> 39:46.416
I don't want to
labor the point, do I?

39:46.418 --> 39:48.952
I might, you know, give
them the wrong impression.

39:48.954 --> 39:50.720
Right. Oh, right.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.656
Because you're so bloody irresistible,
is that it, Carl Evans?

39:53.658 --> 39:55.425
Listen to me.
I've seen you dancing

39:55.427 --> 39:57.160
round my back yard
with no clothes on

39:57.162 --> 39:58.695
since you were this high.

39:58.697 --> 40:01.898
And I can tell you right now, these
gays have thrown better away.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.200
Now, move yourself. And you.

40:09.241 --> 40:12.142
<i>¶ Red, gold and green</i>

40:12.144 --> 40:16.546

40:16.548 --> 40:18.348
this is a first, this.

40:18.350 --> 40:20.884
Men on the dance floor.

40:20.886 --> 40:22.819
You can't be serious!

40:22.821 --> 40:25.722
Welsh men don't dance,
do they, sian?

40:25.724 --> 40:27.791
Never. Can't move their hips.

40:29.727 --> 40:32.729
Well, why don't we show them
what they're missing?

40:32.731 --> 40:35.999

42:38.322 --> 42:40.089
God, I miss disco.

42:50.301 --> 42:52.902
Everyone back to mine
for a nightcap.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.104
What? Go to bed, cliff.

42:55.873 --> 42:57.006
I promise I'll do it, man.

42:57.008 --> 42:59.809
For God's sake.
He always gets like this.

42:59.811 --> 43:02.478
What did I
bloody say to you, eh?

43:02.480 --> 43:03.580
Showing us up in
front of our guest.

43:05.317 --> 43:07.150
Don't worry.
You're going to love it.

43:07.152 --> 43:09.319
Cheers, mate.

43:09.321 --> 43:11.321
Oi. What the hell
was that about?

43:11.323 --> 43:13.189
He's going to give him dance lessons.
Are you joking?

43:13.191 --> 43:15.391
You'll start
prancing about like that?

43:15.393 --> 43:18.161
Listen, if you're going to
spend the rest of your life

43:18.163 --> 43:20.263
standing at the bar wishing you
could speak to Debbie Thomas,

43:20.265 --> 43:21.564
that's fine by me.

43:21.566 --> 43:23.866
I'm going to be a woman magnet.

43:23.868 --> 43:25.768
Where the bloody
hell did you get that?

43:34.712 --> 43:36.346
I don't know
why you're so het up.

43:36.348 --> 43:37.780
They're going in the morning.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.749
Well, this strike matters
to you two, does it?

43:39.751 --> 43:41.284
Of course it does.

43:41.286 --> 43:44.854
What do you think people will
say when they hear about this?

43:44.856 --> 43:47.423
We're being
backed up by perverts.

43:48.626 --> 43:51.194
You want people
taking the piss, do you?

43:51.196 --> 43:54.130
Scabs? Coppers?

43:54.132 --> 43:55.798
Calling us all sorts of names?

43:55.800 --> 43:56.899
No.

43:58.202 --> 44:00.470
I know one thing.

44:00.472 --> 44:03.539
Your father would
never have stood for it.

44:10.748 --> 44:12.649
That went well, considering.

44:12.651 --> 44:14.484
Considering?

44:14.486 --> 44:17.987
Sometimes people can surprise
you, that's all I'm saying.

44:17.989 --> 44:20.056
I never had
a problem with it, sian.

44:20.058 --> 44:23.493
Well, I'm glad to hear it,
because this is Joe.

44:23.961 --> 44:25.061
Bye.

44:25.063 --> 44:27.797
And he's going to
be sleeping in our house.

44:29.233 --> 44:30.466
How do?

44:30.468 --> 44:31.668
Nice to meet you.

44:34.505 --> 44:36.339
No need to do the full
Barry white, Martin.

44:36.341 --> 44:38.741
He knows you're heterosexual.

44:52.690 --> 44:53.823
This is fine.

44:56.995 --> 44:58.194
I think we should
take him to the door.

44:58.196 --> 44:59.662
No. Just here, please.

44:59.664 --> 45:00.897
Just drop me here.

45:02.834 --> 45:05.034
All right.
Oh, leave him alone.

45:05.036 --> 45:06.335
Hang on a minute.

45:12.276 --> 45:13.476
What is it?

45:13.478 --> 45:14.610
Got to keep up the fiction.

45:19.516 --> 45:20.717
See you.

45:27.124 --> 45:29.425
Wife. Was it fun?

45:30.461 --> 45:33.629
It was the best experience
of my entire life.

45:34.698 --> 45:36.232
Making pastry?

46:08.699 --> 46:12.668
You wanna start something,
you start it with me!

46:12.670 --> 46:14.604
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

46:14.606 --> 46:15.738
Thank you.

46:25.582 --> 46:27.083
Let's keep
it moving, girls.

46:27.085 --> 46:28.317
Just put it in.

46:33.223 --> 46:35.024
Victory to the miners!

46:49.574 --> 46:51.474
Lesbian and gays support
the miners.

46:51.476 --> 46:53.309
Any donations, sir?

46:56.413 --> 46:59.782
Don't worry about me freezing
to death in Brixton, will you?

46:59.784 --> 47:01.450
Aren't you going
to ring your mum?

47:01.452 --> 47:03.452
What for? A long-distance
queer-bashing?

47:03.454 --> 47:04.554
Hi.

47:04.556 --> 47:05.822
Here you are, love.

47:05.824 --> 47:07.356
Why don't I pretend
to be your girlfriend?

47:07.358 --> 47:10.426
That way you get an alibi and I
get to watch <i>the sound of music.</i>

47:10.428 --> 47:12.161
Come to ours, Steph. Can I?

47:12.163 --> 47:14.397
Yeah. <i>Orphans of the storm.</i>

47:15.065 --> 47:16.699
No queen's speech. No Carols.

47:16.701 --> 47:18.501
Oh, sounds like heaven.

47:18.503 --> 47:19.702
Support the miners.

47:22.105 --> 47:24.140
A very happy
Christmas to you, too.

47:24.142 --> 47:26.309
<i>There is now a danger</i>

47:26.311 --> 47:28.444
<i>that has become</i>
<i>a threat to us all.</i>

47:28.446 --> 47:32.014
<i>It is a deadly disease</i>
<i>and there is no known cure.</i>

<i>passed during sexual intercourse

47:37.622 --> 47:38.955
Aids.

47:38.957 --> 47:42.058
Anally injected death sentence.

47:43.160 --> 47:45.595
Will you switch that off,
please, Tony?

47:45.597 --> 47:47.630
<i>But it's spreading.</i>

47:47.632 --> 47:49.599
Thank you.
<i>So protect yourself.</i>

47:52.754 --> 47:53.203
Hello?

47:53.204 --> 47:55.771
<i> Can I speak</i>
<i>to Jonathan, please?</i>

47:55.773 --> 47:59.141
Uh, no, he's being creative in
the kitchen, I'm afraid. Uh...

47:59.143 --> 48:00.243
Take a message.

48:00.245 --> 48:02.411
I just wanted to thank him
for his beautiful card.

48:02.813 --> 48:03.946
Homemade, too.

48:05.215 --> 48:08.150
My husband was particularly
impressed with it.

48:08.152 --> 48:10.052
<i>I'll be sure to tell him.</i>

48:10.054 --> 48:12.955
Is that a welsh accent
I can hear?

48:12.957 --> 48:15.958
Uh, oh, maybe. The remnants.

48:15.960 --> 48:19.695
I haven't been home
in a long time so...

48:19.697 --> 48:20.963
<i> Well,</i>
<i>we're looking forward</i>

48:20.965 --> 48:22.198
<i>to seeing them</i>
<i>all back here soon.</i>

48:22.200 --> 48:24.033
And wish Jonathan
a happy Christmas

48:24.035 --> 48:25.801
from all of us in dulais,
will you?

48:25.803 --> 48:27.303
<i> Of course.</i>
<i>Of course I will.</i>

48:27.305 --> 48:28.871
<i>Nadolig llawen</i> to you, my love.

Oh, Jesus.

49:34.938 --> 49:36.205
Let's get the stuff unloaded

49:36.207 --> 49:39.008

49:42.312 --> 49:44.714
What the bloody hell
am I doing?

49:44.716 --> 49:47.450
Right, come on, then,
you heard him.

49:49.152 --> 49:51.253
There's noises in the village.

49:51.255 --> 49:53.122
Small voices.

49:53.124 --> 49:54.590
Nothing we can't handle but...

49:54.592 --> 49:56.959
They want to go back?

49:56.961 --> 50:00.830
They've been told they'll save
the pits that go back first.

50:00.832 --> 50:05.201
They won't but, uh, desperate
people, they'll believe anything.

50:06.970 --> 50:09.038
Tell him about the bus.

50:10.340 --> 50:12.241
Our bus has broken down.

50:12.243 --> 50:14.577
And our gas
has been cut off, so...

50:15.445 --> 50:17.813
We're having baths next door.

50:20.283 --> 50:24.620
<i>We're playing for</i>
<i>a tin of beef now.</i>

50:24.622 --> 50:27.590
<i>Remember, all your proceeds</i>
<i>to the strike fund,</i>

50:27.592 --> 50:30.359
<i>ladies and gents,</i>
<i>so please dig deep.</i>

50:30.361 --> 50:33.195
There's a pair for you.
Happy Christmas.

50:33.197 --> 50:35.097
There you go.

50:35.099 --> 50:36.899
Not even Kim wilde's
got them in orange.

50:37.200 --> 50:38.968
Ah...

50:38.970 --> 50:40.436
This is gethin. Ah.

50:40.438 --> 50:41.771
Hello.

50:41.773 --> 50:43.039
He's a little nervous.

50:43.041 --> 50:44.373
Jonathan.

50:44.375 --> 50:45.674
There's no need
to be nervous, boy.

50:45.676 --> 50:47.543
With a good
welsh name like that?

50:47.545 --> 50:49.078
Where are you from, then?

50:49.846 --> 50:51.847
Rhyl, originally.

50:52.849 --> 50:54.784
No. No way.

50:56.319 --> 50:57.686
Listen here, see.

50:57.688 --> 51:00.222
We don't mind the gays
and the lesbians, that's fine.

51:00.224 --> 51:03.025
But don't you dare be bringing
people from north wales down here.

51:13.036 --> 51:14.603
Stupid bugger.

51:19.876 --> 51:22.678
That bus is a lifeline.
It takes them into the picket.

51:22.680 --> 51:25.147
It takes the food parcels
to the remotest villages.

51:25.149 --> 51:27.183
Without it...

51:27.185 --> 51:29.985
<i> All the fours, 44.</i>

51:29.987 --> 51:31.854
We need to start thinking
in larger chunks of money

51:31.856 --> 51:33.889
because without it they're going
to fail, it's as simple as that.

51:33.891 --> 51:34.990
I'm sorry,
but when are you going

51:34.992 --> 51:36.692
to address my question
about a women's group?

51:36.694 --> 51:38.661
<i> Blind 70.</i>

51:38.663 --> 51:40.362
Stella, this is important.

51:40.364 --> 51:44.100
I know. But this group has
absolutely no Democratic process.

51:44.102 --> 51:46.001
What do you need
a women's group for, anyway?

51:46.003 --> 51:47.603
<i>Thee and me, 23.</i>

51:47.605 --> 51:49.171
To address the women's issues.

51:49.173 --> 51:51.107
Singly and in
a safe environment.

51:51.109 --> 51:53.876
What is unsafe
about this environment?

51:53.878 --> 51:55.945
<i> Kelly's eye,</i>
<i>number one.</i>

51:55.947 --> 51:57.913
I'm a woman, Mike. Okay?

51:57.915 --> 52:00.783
I'm also a lesbian
and a feminist.

52:00.785 --> 52:04.120
Listen, love, I don't care
if you're Arthur scargill.

52:04.122 --> 52:06.021
Don't talk during the bingo.

52:07.458 --> 52:10.526
<i> Tickety-boo, 62.</i>

52:13.898 --> 52:20.002
<i>¶ Drink to me</i>
<i>only with thine eyes</i>

52:23.407 --> 52:24.773
Thirty-six.

52:25.709 --> 52:27.409
For God's sake,
leave him alone.

52:27.411 --> 52:28.711
He's not a girls' world.

52:28.713 --> 52:30.212
But we love him, mum.

52:31.616 --> 52:33.582
Okay. Design speed.

52:33.584 --> 52:37.153
It's called
the great Atlantic fault.

52:37.155 --> 52:41.657
And, uh,
and it starts here in Spain

52:41.659 --> 52:43.792
and then it goes
under the bay of biscay

52:44.828 --> 52:46.996
and then it comes
up in South wales.

52:46.998 --> 52:51.634
And then it goes under the Atlantic
for Miles and Miles and Miles

52:51.636 --> 52:55.237
and it comes up
again in Pennsylvania.

52:55.239 --> 52:56.605
My father used
to talk about it.

52:56.607 --> 52:58.307
And mine.

52:58.309 --> 52:59.875
The dark artery.

52:59.877 --> 53:01.377
That's it. Yeah, that's it.

53:02.345 --> 53:04.513
And you
could take a miner

53:05.615 --> 53:08.417
from wales or Spain or America

53:08.419 --> 53:11.854
and you could show them that seam
and they would recognize it.

53:11.856 --> 53:15.891
There's no other coal like it.
It's perfect. Pure.

53:19.930 --> 53:23.999
I lost my younger
brother to that pit.

53:24.001 --> 53:25.601
Thirty-six years old.

53:25.603 --> 53:30.072
But without it, these villages
are nothing, they're finished.

53:31.274 --> 53:33.209
That's what I'd say

53:33.211 --> 53:37.379
if I ever came face-to-face
with Margaret fucking Thatcher.

53:38.348 --> 53:40.516
That's what I'd tell her.

53:41.851 --> 53:44.253
The pit and the people
are one and the same.

53:46.856 --> 53:50.226
Yeah. Well...

53:54.297 --> 53:56.232
Welcome home, son. Thank you.

53:56.234 --> 53:57.700
Wife.

54:15.752 --> 54:18.554
Listen to me, everyone.
I just want to say something.

54:18.556 --> 54:19.788
Get your feet off those seats.

54:23.093 --> 54:25.027
No.

54:25.029 --> 54:27.029
No, we have.
We haven't collected enough.

54:27.031 --> 54:30.199
We haven't raised enough awareness.
We know that.

54:30.201 --> 54:32.268
Now, it's not enough
to always be defending.

54:32.270 --> 54:36.171
Sometimes you have to
attack to push forward,

54:36.173 --> 54:38.274
and that's exactly
what we're going to do.

54:38.276 --> 54:41.377
When we get back to London,
and you have my word on this,

54:41.379 --> 54:42.444
we are going to...

54:43.513 --> 54:45.914
We're going to do
something so spectacular.

54:47.118 --> 54:49.118
It'll be so incredible,

54:49.120 --> 54:51.353
so effective,
that the national coal board,

54:51.355 --> 54:52.721
I promise you this,

54:52.723 --> 54:55.291
will come crawling
on their hands and knees

54:56.794 --> 54:58.360
In full drag,

55:00.563 --> 55:03.365
to beg you for forgiveness.

55:03.367 --> 55:05.901
Now, victory!
Victory to the miners!

55:11.074 --> 55:13.242
Well done. wife!

55:13.244 --> 55:14.510
Victory to the miners!

55:15.312 --> 55:20.616
<i>¶ As we come marching, marching</i>

55:20.618 --> 55:24.953

57:05.723 --> 57:07.556
Go back to
where you came from!

57:15.865 --> 57:17.566
We've come to take
back our welfare.

57:17.568 --> 57:18.867
What are you talking about?

57:18.869 --> 57:20.102
From all your bloody queers.

57:20.104 --> 57:21.336
What the hell's going on?

57:21.338 --> 57:22.704
There's normal people who wanna

57:22.706 --> 57:24.006
drink in here as well,
you know?

57:24.008 --> 57:26.041
You listen to me. Those people
in there are our guests.

57:26.043 --> 57:28.343
Yeah? Well,
they wanna watch themselves.

57:28.345 --> 57:30.412
Leave it, Martin.
Come on, for God's sake, man.

57:30.414 --> 57:31.780
Come on, leave it.

57:31.782 --> 57:33.048
Come on, Martin.

57:33.050 --> 57:36.685
You so much as lay one finger
on anyone inside that hall,

57:36.687 --> 57:39.455
and so help me God, I'll break
your bloody arms and legs for you.

57:40.724 --> 57:41.964
Come on. Come back in. Come on.

57:46.062 --> 57:47.663
Bent bastards!

57:50.567 --> 57:51.767
There you go.
I know it's freezing

57:51.769 --> 57:54.136
but at least
the beers will be cold.

57:54.138 --> 57:55.704
- You want a beer, anyone?
- Yeah, over here.

57:55.706 --> 57:57.439
I've got one,
thanks, dai.

57:58.074 --> 57:59.741
Here you go, Alan.

57:59.743 --> 58:02.744
"Say not the struggle

58:02.746 --> 58:05.147

Oh, that's more like it.

58:31.742 --> 58:33.375
I'm Gary. Oh.

58:34.777 --> 58:36.144
Hi.

58:36.146 --> 58:38.146
I want to learn to dance.

58:41.585 --> 58:42.751
We need to make
something happen.

58:42.753 --> 58:44.786
Yeah, well, we do now, yeah.

58:44.788 --> 58:46.755
Something big. An event.

58:46.757 --> 58:50.692
Something bigger
than we've ever tried before.

58:50.694 --> 58:52.261
Why don't you come inside?
It's a fraction warmer.

58:52.263 --> 58:54.463
It's morale. That's the thing.

58:54.465 --> 58:57.866
It's just as important as money.
We need to keep them up, Mike.

58:57.868 --> 58:59.701
Because the minute they start
to feel like a lost cause...

58:59.703 --> 59:01.403
I know. I know.

59:12.816 --> 59:15.817
And there's nothing worse
than a lost cause.

I'm in wales

59:28.532 --> 59:31.867

to be something that I'm not.

59:31.869 --> 59:34.736
I'm home. And I'm gay.

59:34.738 --> 59:36.004
And I'm welsh.

59:36.006 --> 59:37.773
That's right!

59:39.175 --> 59:41.076
Get him another beer
before he starts singing.

59:42.313 --> 59:45.948
What I don't understand is why
you never came back before.

59:49.319 --> 59:50.819
My mother.

59:55.925 --> 59:57.159
She couldn't accept me.

59:57.161 --> 59:58.360
Not then, perhaps.

59:58.362 --> 01:00:01.196
She's religious.

01:00:01.198 --> 01:00:03.732
She hasn't said
one word to me in 16 years.

01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:05.734
And what about you? What
words have you said to her?

01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:10.505

I'm a gobby
northern lesbian, Gwen.

01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:28.357
I tend to scare 'em off.

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:31.426
Look.

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:34.429
That's my William.

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:36.965
Forty-four years
I had him with me

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:40.068
and I wish you as many
with someone one day.

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:41.937
And as happy.

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:45.707
Jesus, I'm pissed.

01:00:45.709 --> 01:00:47.376
Alan, no!

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.278
Give us a hand,
will you, Steph?

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.281
He's thrown up again.
Margaret, I am so sorry.

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:56.051
Alan pritchard,
so help me.

01:00:58.421 --> 01:01:01.490
"For many years now we have

"first as victims,

Margaret Donovan
could be reported.

Well, they want to see
what's going on up here.

01:01:25.649 --> 01:01:27.783
They'd have a field day.

Why don't you
come over to dai's?

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:42.597
Just for a minute.

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:44.299
I think if you met
one or two of them...

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:46.868
Have you seen this, cliff?
About the gays?

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.804
I don't believe
what they say about us, Lee.

01:01:48.806 --> 01:01:50.939
Why should I listen
to what they say about them?

01:01:50.941 --> 01:01:52.941
Get inside, you. And shut up.

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:58.313
You're a respected woman,
Maureen.

01:01:58.315 --> 01:02:01.249

You could set an example.

You're the backbone of that committee.
You work hard.

01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:08.990
You've been both mother
and father to those boys.

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:11.526
Sitting on your own
in the dark, Maureen?

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:14.796
You wanna take that rod out
of your arse for a minute.

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:04.846
Good luck.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.319
Morning.

01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:12.754
Thanks.

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:44.286
Hello?

01:03:44.288 --> 01:03:47.289
I'm in a phone box
so I'll have to be quick.

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:50.559
I got a story
for your news desk.

01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:32.834
Hello, mum.

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:47.249
Bye, bromley.

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:50.919
See you.

01:05:26.723 --> 01:05:28.643
Hello, sailors.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.359
Morning, ladies.

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:36.765
Come on, maries.
What are they going on about?

01:05:36.767 --> 01:05:38.133
...With your bum chum.

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:42.938
- What's going on?
- Wait till you see this.

01:05:44.907 --> 01:05:46.174
Jesus.

01:05:47.376 --> 01:05:49.744
<i>"Perverts support the pits.</i>

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:53.748
"A gaggle of gays
and lesbians has 'come out'

01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:56.184
"in favor
of the miners' strike.

01:05:56.186 --> 01:05:57.719
"Our editor says,

01:05:57.721 --> 01:05:59.921
"'we knew
the miners were desperate,

01:05:59.923 --> 01:06:03.391
"'but now we have the final
and compelling evidence

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:04.926
"'that they are finished.'"

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:08.596
"does anyone else hear the bottom
of the barrel being scraped?

01:06:08.598 --> 01:06:11.700
"From where I'm sitting, the
noise is pretty deafening."

01:06:11.702 --> 01:06:13.335
Unbelievable.

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:18.239
Who did this?

01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:19.574
It'll have to go to a vote.

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:21.643
But I'm warning you, we can do
without this kind of trouble.

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:24.212
This isn't trouble, it's mischief.
Jesus, man.

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:26.147
We've had worse
than this before now.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:28.383
Every day they're
out collecting for us.

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:29.751
It's the men, dai.

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:32.253
They've already got their wives
supporting them, and now this.

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:35.256
Gays. The whole country
laughing at us.

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:37.459
It's about dignity.

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:39.661
It'll have to go to a vote.

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:43.298
Right.

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:46.568
They're calling an emergency meeting.
A vote.

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:49.571
Dai's speaking up for us, of course,
but it's done a lot of damage.

01:06:49.573 --> 01:06:51.639
Yeah, but we're not going to let a
little thing like this break...

01:06:53.143 --> 01:06:54.275
Down! Get down!

01:06:54.277 --> 01:06:55.377
What's going on?

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:11.092
Bastards!

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:16.097
I don't care about what they
do, but it's a distraction.

01:07:16.099 --> 01:07:18.099
It's distracting people
from the strike.

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:19.801
And then there's the children.

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:21.603
I mean, what example
is it for kiddies

01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:23.805
to have gays
and lesbians roaming around?

01:07:23.807 --> 01:07:25.240
It's unnatural.

01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:28.109
There used to be a tradition in
wales of honoring your guests.

01:07:28.111 --> 01:07:29.310
Do you remember that, ladies?

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:31.346
Respect? Generosity? Hefina...

01:07:31.348 --> 01:07:32.714
There's only one
thing that's unnatural

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:34.015
about this whole
bloody business.

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:36.017
Betraying the community.

01:07:36.019 --> 01:07:38.186
And when I find out who sold
that story, believe me,

01:07:38.188 --> 01:07:41.356
they'll know what it feels
like to be ashamed.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.029
What the hell are we doing?

01:07:48.031 --> 01:07:49.397
Now, let's just get
this finished, mark.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.999
No, no, I mean,
what the hell are we doing?

01:07:51.001 --> 01:07:53.401
They would never have known we were
here if it wasn't for this article.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.070
So? So they would
never have found us.

01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:57.038
So, what are you saying, mark, I
should just send them the bill?

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.140
Do you know how many people
read this paper?

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:01.543
This is our chance
to do something spectacular.

01:08:01.545 --> 01:08:02.911
We could never
drum up this kind

01:08:02.913 --> 01:08:04.245
of publicity
in a million years.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:07.015
Mark, don't you just think we
ought to hold back and regroup?

01:08:07.017 --> 01:08:09.417
There isn't time to regroup.
This is a news item now.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:10.852
Today. We have to take
advantage of that.

01:08:10.854 --> 01:08:12.921
They called us perverts.
Bromley,

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:15.557
it's time for an important
part of your education.

01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:18.460
Hands up in this room if you've
ever been called a name like that.

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:23.898
Now, there is a long and honorable
tradition in the gay community

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:27.268
and it has stood us in good
stead for a very long time.

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.502
When somebody
calls you a name...

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:29.571
Am I right about this,
Jonathan?

01:08:29.573 --> 01:08:30.638
Dead right.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.041
You take it and you own it.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:40.281
<i>¶ That's what my heart</i>
<i>yearns for now</i>

You owe me.

<i>¶ That's what my heart</i>

It's
a fundraising concert

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.393
and we're
looking for bands to...

01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:56.096
No, no. No, no, no, I am in
no way suggesting that sting,

01:08:56.099 --> 01:08:58.260
or indeed any other member
of the police, is a pervert.

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:02.636
Cool. Cheers.

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:07.942
Oh, I can probably get you some
more, next week if you want.

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:09.777
He'll call. Okay.

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:13.548
<i>¶ Take your hairdryer</i>

<i>¶ In you I find a reason</i>

01:09:25.095 --> 01:09:27.996
there are no gay artists
on this label. I'm sorry.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.764
They don't have to be gay,
that's the point.

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:31.299
This is a coming together
of all different people...

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.404
Reception.

01:09:39.576 --> 01:09:41.408
It arrived about 10
minutes ago, Barry.

01:09:43.511 --> 01:09:45.479
Yeah, well, you could
come down and get it.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.850
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:52.020
That's the number
for gay switchboard.

01:09:52.022 --> 01:09:55.790
You never know, one of them
might need it one day.

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:57.125
We'll be back
in good time for the vote.

01:09:57.127 --> 01:09:58.259
Right-o.

01:09:58.261 --> 01:10:00.628
Any problems, we can be
reached at the bookshop.

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:01.863
You're
gonna miss this train.

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:03.031
Rowena Roberts has had a baby.

01:10:03.033 --> 01:10:04.432
She needs an extra box.

01:10:04.434 --> 01:10:05.733
I can't hear you.

01:10:05.735 --> 01:10:07.068
Rowena Roberts has had a baby.

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:09.837
Strange. I can't... I can't...
I can't hear you.

01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:10.939
She needs an extra box.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:25.820
<i>¶ Some love and pride</i>

01:10:25.822 --> 01:10:31.059
<i>¶ that's what my heart</i>
<i>yearns for now</i>

01:10:31.061 --> 01:10:32.961
<i>¶ love and pride ¶</i>

01:10:32.963 --> 01:10:36.130
and the difference is this
is open to everyone. Okay?

01:10:36.132 --> 01:10:38.032
Gay, straight,
it doesn't matter.

01:10:38.034 --> 01:10:40.201
We want people to come together
to show their support.

01:10:40.203 --> 01:10:42.403
And why should gay people
like me support the miners?

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:45.473
Because miners dig for coal,
which produces power,

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:48.176
which allows gay people like
you to dance to bananarama

01:10:48.178 --> 01:10:49.711
until 3:00 in the morning.

01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:50.845
Next question?

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:53.948
Are you all right?

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:56.985
Yes, you. The cute one.

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:00.588
I've never met a pop star.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.357
I have. Max boyce.

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:04.560
He was playing swansea grand
the year our Jane was born.

01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:06.327
What's funny about that?

01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:10.064
You need to push the t-shirts and
the badges as hard as you can.

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:13.635
This is a fundraiser. Make
sure people are buying stuff.

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:17.405
Is he in charge?

01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:18.673
He's the official photographer.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:28.249
We don't want it to be all churchy.
Do you know what I mean?

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:30.018
It's a christening.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.686
Yeah,
but the readings don't all

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:33.288
have to come from the Bible,
do they?

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:35.590
You can have all sorts
of things nowadays.

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:37.692
It's more open.

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:44.432
Meeting's tomorrow afternoon.
3:00 sharp.

01:11:44.434 --> 01:11:45.733
We'll make it as long
as we leave early enough.

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:46.834
And the vote?

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:48.036
At the end.

01:11:48.038 --> 01:11:49.470
Single question,

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:52.407
can we continue taking your support
in the light of recent events?

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:53.675
"Recent events." wife.

01:11:53.677 --> 01:11:56.144
You won't have anything to
worry about, I'm telling you.

01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:57.378
When they see
what you make out of this.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.546
If we make
anything out of this.

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:01.149
Are you joking, man?
You're already famous.

01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:02.817
Give it here.

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:06.054
"Bronski beat are

Yeah? As a matter of fact,
we're not gay, either.

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:15.049
Oh.

01:14:15.051 --> 01:14:16.451
We're miners.

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:25.760
That's perfect.

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:28.629
Hey. Why?

If you see Steph,
perhaps you'd give her this?

trust myself, do you?

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:03.331
<i>¶ Can you tell me why? ¶</i>

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:13.641
<i>Well, it's incredible to see such
a mix of people here tonight.</i>

01:15:13.643 --> 01:15:15.409
<i>Gay and straight.</i>

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:19.614
<i>Can you see what</i>
<i>we've done here?</i>

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:21.849
<i>By coming together, all of us,</i>

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.585
<i>by pledging our solidarity,</i>

01:15:24.587 --> 01:15:28.322
<i>our friendship,</i>
<i>we've made history.</i>

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:45.673
<i>Back in our...</i>

01:15:45.675 --> 01:15:48.876
<i>Back in our</i>
<i>miners' lodge, in wales,</i>

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:52.280
<i>we have a banner.</i>

01:15:52.282 --> 01:15:56.217
<i>And it's old, it's very old.</i>
<i>Maybe 100 years.</i>

01:15:57.319 --> 01:16:01.188
<i>And it's this,</i>
<i>two hands together.</i>

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:04.759
<i>Joined like this.</i>

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:08.829
<i>Well, I tell you now,</i>

01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:12.400
<i>you've worn our badge,</i>
<i>"coal not dole,"</i>

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:17.438
<i>and when the time comes,</i>
<i>you have my word on this,</i>

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.141
<i>we will wear yours.</i>

01:16:21.311 --> 01:16:22.410
<i>Shoulder to shoulder.</i>

01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:24.312
<i>Hand to hand.</i>

01:16:30.152 --> 01:16:32.353
Come on, then, that's right.
We're off out for the night.

01:16:32.355 --> 01:16:34.221
I hope you ladies
aren't going to let me down.

01:16:34.223 --> 01:16:37.692
What? We want to see everything!
Don't we?

01:16:37.694 --> 01:16:38.960
What, everything?

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:40.194
Even the rubber scene.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:43.598
<i>By dead or alive playing)</i>

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.933
<i>¶ You spin me right round, baby</i>

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:48.269
<i>¶ right round</i>
<i>like a record, baby</i>

01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:50.571
<i>¶ right round, round, round</i>

01:16:50.573 --> 01:16:53.574
<i>¶ you spin me right round, baby</i>

01:16:53.576 --> 01:16:55.776
<i>¶ right round</i>
<i>like a record, baby</i>

01:16:55.778 --> 01:17:00.948
<i>¶ I want your love</i>

01:17:03.719 --> 01:17:07.188
<i>¶ I want your love ¶</i>

01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:12.093
Sorry, ladies.
This is a men-only venue.

01:17:12.095 --> 01:17:14.695
Oh, don't be daft, love. We've
come all the way from powys.

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:19.634
Evening.

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:21.268
Hello.

01:17:22.538 --> 01:17:25.640
<i>¶ Blue-eyed dressed</i>
<i>for every situation</i>

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:30.444
<i>¶ moving through</i>
<i>the doorway of a nation</i>

01:17:30.446 --> 01:17:32.546
<i>¶ pick me up and</i>
<i>shake the doubt</i>

01:17:32.548 --> 01:17:35.282
<i>¶ baby I can't do without</i>

01:17:35.284 --> 01:17:37.818
how'd you get into
that leotard, then?

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.820
Um, talcum powder.

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:40.988
What?

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:43.591
Talcum powder.

01:17:43.593 --> 01:17:47.161
Oh. Lily of the valley, I use.

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:54.402
Mark?

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:58.039
Oh, my God. Mark Ashton.

01:17:58.273 --> 01:17:59.540
Tim.

01:18:01.309 --> 01:18:03.210
Oh, this is insane.

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:06.113
I'm bumping into
everybody tonight.

01:18:06.115 --> 01:18:07.648
How are you?

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:12.053
You still changing the world?

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:14.689
Tim, come on.

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:17.591
I haven't been home
in four days.

01:18:17.593 --> 01:18:19.427
Haven't you?

01:18:19.429 --> 01:18:21.395
I'm on a farewell tour.

01:18:22.297 --> 01:18:23.864
Where are you going?

01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:38.679
You are a beautiful man, mark.

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:42.683
I miss you.

01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:47.655
Please take care
of yourself. Okay?

01:18:47.657 --> 01:18:48.956
Please.

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:50.024
Come on.

01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:51.092
Please take care.

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:02.236
Come on, then, girls.
That's enough.

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:06.240
Back to ours. Bedtime. Come on.

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:08.709
I'm sorry. Don't worry.

01:19:08.711 --> 01:19:10.077
You're lighter
than your husband.

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:11.545
Wife.

01:19:11.547 --> 01:19:15.349
Do you know what I was
when I met Alan?

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:16.617
Drunk?

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:19.086
Sixteen.

01:19:20.055 --> 01:19:22.156
Think that's ridiculous?

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:25.760
I was pretty then.

01:19:25.762 --> 01:19:27.094
You're pretty now.

01:19:29.197 --> 01:19:31.599
It all goes South, doesn't it?

01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:35.236
Love. Looks. Everything.

01:19:35.238 --> 01:19:36.804
That's cheery.

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:38.672
Sod it.

01:19:38.674 --> 01:19:41.509
I always thought sex was
for the men, really, anyway.

01:19:41.511 --> 01:19:44.378
We just put up with it, don't we?
Keep them quiet.

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:45.846
Okay.

01:19:45.848 --> 01:19:48.916
I will listen to a certain amount
of drunken bollocks, Gail,

01:19:48.918 --> 01:19:50.985
but sex is not
just for the men,

01:19:50.987 --> 01:19:52.987
it's for the women, too.
Believe me.

01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:06.934
Oh, yeah.

01:20:06.936 --> 01:20:08.936
Gail, come on.

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:21.315
No carpets.

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:24.685
This is Laura Ashley.
I've seen it before.

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:28.055
Where? Cardiff.

01:20:28.057 --> 01:20:29.557
What I
want to know is...

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:32.159
What's this?

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:36.163
Hefina, you put
that back immediately.

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:37.832
That's nothing.

01:20:37.834 --> 01:20:39.400
Here,
look what else I've found.

01:20:39.402 --> 01:20:41.669
You never
went under his bed.

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:48.409
When was the last time
you saw anything like that?

01:20:48.411 --> 01:20:50.177
Huh? When? When?

01:20:56.151 --> 01:20:58.185
Don't those women ever sleep?

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:05.359
Jesus, God, that takes me back.

01:21:54.809 --> 01:21:55.876
Mum.

01:22:19.401 --> 01:22:21.101
So, what were
their names again, boys?

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:22.736
Mine was Jess.

01:22:22.738 --> 01:22:24.038
And mine was Carol.

01:22:25.908 --> 01:22:27.207
Six
straight people asked me

01:22:27.209 --> 01:22:28.442
if they could
join us last night.

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:30.110
You're joking? We should
set up another group.

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:31.832
Straights supporting gays
supporting miners.

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:42.356
Right, that's it, we're off.

01:22:42.358 --> 01:22:43.624
What about bromley?

01:22:43.626 --> 01:22:45.192
He's too late. You've got
a meeting to get to.

01:22:45.194 --> 01:22:46.593
The vote, remember?

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:49.063
Okay.

01:22:49.065 --> 01:22:50.698
Surely you've got
his number, Steph?

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:52.733
Nobody's got his number.
He still lives at home.

01:22:52.735 --> 01:22:55.069
I'm sorry, but mark's right. If
we're going to get there by 3:00...

01:22:55.071 --> 01:22:56.503
He's blown it.
Come on, let's go.

01:22:56.505 --> 01:22:57.871
Oh. What a shame.

01:22:57.873 --> 01:22:59.540
He was sucking face
till the lights came up.

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:01.875
I wouldn't waste any time
feeling sorry for him.

01:23:01.877 --> 01:23:04.011
Can I please have an aspirin?

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.518
<i> What the hell's this?</i>

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.354
Plans change, cliff.
It's not my fault.

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.190
No answer.

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:51.291
They must be on their way.

01:23:51.293 --> 01:23:54.094
Okay.

01:23:54.096 --> 01:23:56.830
I can't speak in front
of all these people, cliff.

01:23:56.832 --> 01:23:58.332
I can't.

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:12.279
I know you think you know what you
want, Joe, but you're so young.

01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:16.550
That's what the law's for,
to protect you.

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:31.098
I didn't know
who I was at your age.

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:38.739
It's such a terrible life, Joe.

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:42.943
It's lonely.

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:46.080
Is that what you want?

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:48.982
No family?

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:52.786
Hiding from people at work,
from everyone?

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:55.222
Keeping secrets?

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:06.767
Come here.

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:09.837
Oh.

01:25:09.839 --> 01:25:13.273
<i> So now cliff will speak</i>
<i>on behalf of the lgsm.</i>

01:25:13.275 --> 01:25:14.908
The floor's yours, cliff.

01:25:22.884 --> 01:25:25.085
Um... w...

01:25:25.087 --> 01:25:28.122
Well, what I want to say abo...

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:32.526
About the gays and lesbians...

01:25:32.528 --> 01:25:34.294
Why don't you do
us a poem, cliff?

01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:38.298
Poem! Poem! Poem!

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:39.933
Poem! Poem! Poem!

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:45.139
I want to propose that
this meeting is unlawful.

01:25:45.141 --> 01:25:48.542
I want to propose that this meeting
was brought forward unlawfully

01:25:48.544 --> 01:25:49.977
and that most
of the people here

01:25:49.979 --> 01:25:52.045
- aren't even from this village.
- All right.

01:25:52.047 --> 01:25:54.882
All right. Let's bring
it forward to the vote.

01:25:59.955 --> 01:26:01.155
There we go.

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:03.757
Two hours to spare.

01:26:03.759 --> 01:26:07.761
Hefina heddon, you drive
like a bloody lunatic.

01:26:07.763 --> 01:26:09.530
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:26:10.265 --> 01:26:11.632
Gwen, look after the gays.

01:26:11.634 --> 01:26:12.900
Right-o.

01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:22.342
3:00.

01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:24.411
You can't dictate
when the committee sits.

01:26:24.413 --> 01:26:25.846
You told us 3:00.

01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:27.281
And then we had to change it.

01:26:27.283 --> 01:26:28.382
Bloody disgusting
way to behave.

01:26:28.384 --> 01:26:29.449
If you weren't up in London...

01:26:29.451 --> 01:26:31.418
It's invalid. This whole
decision is invalid.

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:32.586
We can fight it.

01:26:32.588 --> 01:26:33.654
We've got one fight, dai.

01:26:33.656 --> 01:26:34.821
The fucking strike.

01:26:34.823 --> 01:26:36.924
Or have you
forgotten that, all of you?

01:26:36.926 --> 01:26:39.026
Dancing around in London.

01:26:39.028 --> 01:26:42.262
The trouble with those people
is they jump on the bandwagon.

01:26:42.264 --> 01:26:43.997
It's well known.

01:26:43.999 --> 01:26:46.200
They pretend they're backing you,
but what they're really doing

01:26:46.202 --> 01:26:48.502
is pushing their own agenda.

01:26:48.504 --> 01:26:49.636
Gay rights.

01:26:49.638 --> 01:26:50.704
What?

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:53.273
We've seen articles, hefina.

01:26:53.275 --> 01:26:55.709
Christ Jesus help me.

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:58.879
You better shut her mouth or I'm
going to do it permanently.

01:27:00.282 --> 01:27:01.615
No, come on,
that's enough.

01:27:01.617 --> 01:27:03.817
An official
letter will be sent.

01:27:03.819 --> 01:27:06.320
I can't...
I can't listen to this.

01:27:06.322 --> 01:27:08.155
To thank them
most sincerely.

01:27:08.157 --> 01:27:12.392
But the vote was we won't be
accepting their support any more.

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:14.595
They're causing us embarrassment,
dai, that's the thing.

01:27:15.296 --> 01:27:17.497
And we're not
strong enough, not now.

01:27:17.499 --> 01:27:19.700
We're struggling
to survive as it is.

01:27:19.702 --> 01:27:21.435
Oh, that reminds me.

01:27:26.976 --> 01:27:29.977
Courtesy of those people
and their agenda.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.447
Jesus Christ.

01:27:34.682 --> 01:27:37.150
I don't suppose you opened
your mouth, did you?

01:27:37.152 --> 01:27:38.785
Didn't want to rock
the boat, is that it?

01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:43.991
There's bloody thousands here.

01:27:50.231 --> 01:27:52.399
You think you've known
someone your whole life.

01:27:52.401 --> 01:27:54.701
Turns out they're
a complete stranger.

01:27:54.703 --> 01:27:57.204
I'd say the same
about you, cliff.

01:27:57.206 --> 01:27:59.006
I'll tell you something.
If you think this is what

01:27:59.008 --> 01:28:01.942
my brother would have wanted,
you're wrong.

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:09.683
We came to help you win and if
we're not helping, we have to go.

01:28:09.685 --> 01:28:11.518
This was all you. No.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.587
It was.

01:28:16.924 --> 01:28:19.026
All right. Take my advice.

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:22.496
Don't give it all to the fight.

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:25.032
Save some for home.

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:28.368
There's more to life, you know?

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:33.907
You girls have opened my eyes.

01:28:33.909 --> 01:28:36.877
I'm going to extend my
repertoire, you'll see.

01:28:36.879 --> 01:28:37.978
The vegan Delia Smith.

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:42.849
Bye.

01:28:42.851 --> 01:28:44.084
Bye.

01:28:44.086 --> 01:28:45.152
Take care, now.

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:11.345
It's a bloody travesty, man.

01:29:43.611 --> 01:29:45.379
- I don't accept it.
- Gethin...

01:29:45.381 --> 01:29:46.546
I don't.

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:49.149
They can't stop me from collecting money.
How can they?

01:29:49.151 --> 01:29:51.051
- Don't be crazy, gethin.
- Geth...

01:29:52.787 --> 01:29:56.123
Somebody better tell
lesbians against pit closures.

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:00.360
What now?

01:30:00.362 --> 01:30:01.728
What do you mean?

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:03.196
What are we doing? Where are we going?
It's over, Mike.

01:30:03.198 --> 01:30:05.632
Were you not paying attention?
We lost.

01:30:06.634 --> 01:30:08.168
And I don't know about you
but I'm pissing off.

01:30:08.170 --> 01:30:09.369
Where? Anywhere.

01:30:09.371 --> 01:30:11.171
I'm out of here.
What about the rest of us?

01:30:11.173 --> 01:30:13.573
Do you think it might be
possible that just for once

01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:15.075
you could make your
own decision, Mike?

01:30:15.077 --> 01:30:17.010
You what? Do you think
that just for once

01:30:17.012 --> 01:30:19.546
you could stop following me
around like a fucking spaniel

01:30:19.548 --> 01:30:20.914
and let me have
a life of my own?

01:30:22.717 --> 01:30:23.950
Yeah.

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:26.353
Yeah, I think I could
manage that, yeah.

01:30:26.355 --> 01:30:28.989
Good. Piss off, all of you.
Leave me alone.

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:32.893
Oh, fu...

01:30:37.266 --> 01:30:39.266
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:43.036
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

01:30:43.038 --> 01:30:44.571
Lesbians and gays
support the miners.

01:30:44.573 --> 01:30:47.541
Never mind the miners. There's
gay people dying every day.

01:30:47.543 --> 01:30:50.143
That's what you should
be thinking about.

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:52.312
Not the bloody miners.

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:54.581
Asshole.

01:30:58.687 --> 01:30:59.753
Excuse me?

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:04.291
Excuse me?

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.528
Excuse me.
I only want to talk to you.

01:31:18.072 --> 01:31:20.106
<i> Now, I tell you what
we'll do, let's come over here.</i>

01:31:20.108 --> 01:31:22.042
<i>This is the key</i>
<i>you swapped it to.</i>

01:31:22.044 --> 01:31:24.544
<i>Oh, well,</i>
<i>we'll leave that there...</i>

01:31:24.546 --> 01:31:27.113
<i>Now, just come over here, my
son, and get yourself a nice...</i>

01:31:27.115 --> 01:31:28.482
Is Joe there, please?

01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:31.117
No, I'm afraid he's out.

01:31:31.119 --> 01:31:33.753
Can you tell him that his
friend gethin's in hospital?

01:31:33.755 --> 01:31:35.589
It's very important.
He's, um...

01:31:35.591 --> 01:31:38.792
He's in St. Thomas' hospital.
He's been beaten up.

01:31:38.794 --> 01:31:40.160
Yes, of course I'll tell him.

01:31:40.162 --> 01:31:41.761
And will you
tell him that Steph

01:31:41.763 --> 01:31:43.430
called round to see how he was?

01:31:46.968 --> 01:31:48.034
Who was that?

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:54.007
Tina. She wants
a lift in the morning.

01:31:54.009 --> 01:31:57.577
You're back at the jobcentre
tomorrow, don't forget.

01:32:03.317 --> 01:32:05.185
I should have...

01:32:05.187 --> 01:32:07.187
I should have said more.

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:11.691
I could have.
I could have spoken better.

01:32:14.095 --> 01:32:16.963
If you're going to cut,
cut it straight.

01:32:16.965 --> 01:32:18.198
Triangles.

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:31.411
I'm gay.

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:40.186
I know.

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:46.526
I've known for a little
while now, cliff.

01:32:48.129 --> 01:32:50.230
Since the gays arrived?

01:32:51.899 --> 01:32:54.701
Well, I can't speak
for the rest of the village

01:32:54.703 --> 01:32:57.871
but speaking for myself,
since about 1968.

01:32:57.873 --> 01:33:00.206
Well...

01:33:03.177 --> 01:33:04.244
Yeah.

01:33:33.375 --> 01:33:35.508
What's that?

01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:36.676
It's the new van.

01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:39.079
About time, too.

01:33:42.516 --> 01:33:43.683
What the hell's this?

01:33:43.685 --> 01:33:44.751
New van.

01:33:44.753 --> 01:33:47.187
Courtesy of our gay friends
down in London.

01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:48.622
I'm not getting in that.

01:33:48.624 --> 01:33:50.056
Then you'll have to stay here.

01:33:50.058 --> 01:33:51.291
In you get, lads. Quick now.

01:34:15.583 --> 01:34:17.550
You a lesbian, are you, love?

01:34:17.552 --> 01:34:21.354
That's right. We're just off to
swansea now for a massive lez-off.

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:43.109
<i>Britain's longest
running national strike is over.</i>

01:34:43.111 --> 01:34:45.945
<i>Amongst scenes of</i>
<i>bitterness and anger,</i>

01:34:45.947 --> 01:34:48.081
<i>num delegates voted narrowly</i>

01:34:48.083 --> 01:34:50.183
<i>for an organized return</i>
<i>to work on Tuesday.</i>

01:34:50.185 --> 01:34:53.286
<i>Tomorrow most of britain's coal
miners will return to work.</i>

01:34:53.288 --> 01:34:56.089
<i>They say they'll march back,</i>
<i>heads held high.</i>

01:34:56.091 --> 01:34:58.758
<i>It's almost a year to the very
day since they walked out</i>

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:00.660
<i>and embarked on</i>
<i>a course of action which...</i>

01:35:00.662 --> 01:35:03.263
Joe,
have you seen the news?

01:35:03.265 --> 01:35:04.698
Thank God for that.

01:35:06.934 --> 01:35:08.101
Joe?

01:35:51.412 --> 01:35:52.746
Bloody hell!

01:36:24.211 --> 01:36:28.014
Mark! Where are you going?
I'm leaving.

01:36:28.016 --> 01:36:31.251
I was trying to make myself
feel better and I failed.

01:36:31.253 --> 01:36:32.919
I've been virtually
under house arrest.

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:34.954
Stuck with my parents.

01:36:34.956 --> 01:36:36.156
I haven't seen anyone.

01:36:36.158 --> 01:36:37.290
I've tried ringing Steph
but she's always...

01:36:37.292 --> 01:36:38.691
Why don't you leave?

01:36:38.693 --> 01:36:40.059
I did, last night.

01:36:40.061 --> 01:36:41.528
I didn't even tell
them I was going.

01:36:41.530 --> 01:36:43.630
That's not leaving,
it's running.

01:36:43.632 --> 01:36:45.064
What are you going to do now?

01:36:45.066 --> 01:36:46.266
Stay here.

01:36:46.268 --> 01:36:47.400
And do what?

01:36:47.402 --> 01:36:48.768
And get a job down the pit?

01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:51.738
That's all they need, a trained
pastry chef with a camera.

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:53.740
When are you going to
get some guts, huh?

01:36:53.742 --> 01:36:55.275
You're a member
of lgsm, bromley.

01:36:55.277 --> 01:36:57.110
So stop sneaking
out of your mammy's house

01:36:57.112 --> 01:36:59.078
in the dead of night
and stand up for yourself.

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:00.613
Have some pride.

01:37:01.582 --> 01:37:03.349
Because life is short, okay?

01:37:05.252 --> 01:37:06.619
It's short.

01:37:09.089 --> 01:37:10.156
Okay?

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:44.424
What should I tell the others?

01:37:44.426 --> 01:37:47.160
Nothing. I wasn't here.

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:53.933
You're a mad bugger.

01:37:53.935 --> 01:37:55.535
I'm taking you home after that.

01:37:55.537 --> 01:37:57.203
In the van. No arguments.

01:37:58.205 --> 01:38:00.440
Will you give this
to Jeff, please, Joe?

01:38:01.108 --> 01:38:02.442
Of course I will.

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.177
Come on.

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:11.584
What about gethin? Is he okay?

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:13.853
Gethin?

01:38:13.855 --> 01:38:16.689
The last I heard
he was back on the ward.

01:38:40.481 --> 01:38:41.881
I don't like meltis fruits.

01:38:43.517 --> 01:38:45.798
Well, then, maybe you won't
go through them quite so fast.

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:50.390
Help me out with these,
will you, bromley?

01:38:55.864 --> 01:38:57.096
Stay in bed.

01:39:00.401 --> 01:39:02.502
Keep an eye on Jonathan
for me, will you?

01:39:02.504 --> 01:39:04.737
He needs to take
care of himself.

01:39:04.739 --> 01:39:06.439
It's you we're taking
care of, you daft sod.

01:39:06.441 --> 01:39:08.374
If you could just make sure
he's got some groceries in.

01:39:08.376 --> 01:39:09.609
Gethin...

01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:10.810
He's HIV-positive, sian.

01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:20.586
He's not supposed to smoke.
And he needs to eat properly.

01:39:26.226 --> 01:39:27.994
Please. For me.

01:39:30.564 --> 01:39:32.198
Gethin.

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:36.936
Hello.

01:39:40.041 --> 01:39:41.107
This is my mum.

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:42.809
Hello.

01:39:42.811 --> 01:39:43.876
Come in.

01:39:47.982 --> 01:39:50.083
Back then, when they knew
even less about this thing,

01:39:50.085 --> 01:39:52.885
they gave out numbers
with each diagnosis.

01:39:53.988 --> 01:39:56.189
One, two, three and so on.

01:39:58.058 --> 01:40:00.493
Course, when they got
into the high thousands, it...

01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:12.972
I'm number two.

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:20.046
Nobody knows
what's keeping me alive.

01:40:21.248 --> 01:40:22.982
I think it's the grass.

01:40:27.821 --> 01:40:29.889
What are you going to do now?

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:32.759
Make you some soup.

01:40:33.827 --> 01:40:36.029
Drive back to wales.

01:40:36.031 --> 01:40:39.032
No, I mean with your life.

01:40:39.034 --> 01:40:42.035
I'm a wife and mother, love.

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:45.705
My life goes
back to normal now.

01:40:47.141 --> 01:40:48.708
Well, it shouldn't.

01:40:50.044 --> 01:40:52.945
You've a first-class mind.

01:40:52.947 --> 01:40:56.282
You should do something.
Go to college.

01:40:56.284 --> 01:40:59.118
Don't waste it, sian.

01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:02.688
There are young people
dying every day now.

01:41:02.690 --> 01:41:03.956
Good people.

01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:07.060
Clever, promising.

01:41:08.295 --> 01:41:09.429
Don't you dare waste it.

01:41:16.504 --> 01:41:18.071
Oh, shit.

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:34.954
Excuse me.

01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:40.326
Sorry.

01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:51.003
What the hell is this?
And where have you been?

01:41:58.579 --> 01:42:01.047
Hello. You must be
Joe's mum. I'm sian.

01:42:01.049 --> 01:42:03.683
Will you please remove
your van from my property?

01:42:05.219 --> 01:42:07.220
I hope you appreciate him.

01:42:07.222 --> 01:42:08.654
'Cause there's a whole
village back in wales

01:42:08.656 --> 01:42:09.989
who thinks he's a hero.

01:42:22.136 --> 01:42:23.903
Joe.

01:42:23.905 --> 01:42:25.471
Mum, he's done this on purpose.

01:42:25.473 --> 01:42:27.006
It's all right, I'm leaving.

01:42:28.108 --> 01:42:30.643
I hope one day
we can be friends again, mum.

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:34.647
Oi, you got something
to say to your sister?

01:42:34.649 --> 01:42:38.718
I've got something to say to you, Jason.
You're a dick.

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:42.221
And Tina, that tight perm doesn't suit you.
It never has.

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:44.657
I'm sorry.

01:42:50.264 --> 01:42:51.464
Joe.

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.800
Joe.

01:43:33.006 --> 01:43:34.240
You all right?

01:43:41.014 --> 01:43:42.315
Cheers.

01:43:43.651 --> 01:43:48.487
While you've been away, I've
been changing my act. You watch.

01:43:48.489 --> 01:43:52.725
Demure and accommodating,
that's me.

01:43:52.727 --> 01:43:55.094
The lesbian lady di.

01:43:58.632 --> 01:44:01.167
I think I'd find that
a tremendous disappointment.

01:44:03.804 --> 01:44:05.805
I'm glad you
came back, bromley.

01:44:05.807 --> 01:44:07.740
It wasn't the same without you.

01:44:09.743 --> 01:44:10.943
Thanks.

01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:19.785
I'm glad I came back, too.

01:44:21.888 --> 01:44:25.258
If we were normal,
this is when we'd kiss.

01:45:00.061 --> 01:45:01.727
There's the rest of it. Thanks.

01:45:03.398 --> 01:45:05.765
"Screw you, Thatcher"
or "fuck you"?

01:45:05.767 --> 01:45:08.134
I can see the appeal of both.

01:45:08.136 --> 01:45:11.003
Jonathan, "screw" or "fuck"?

01:45:11.005 --> 01:45:13.172
"Screw." It's more visceral.

01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:16.509
<i>Attention, attention!</i>

01:45:18.078 --> 01:45:21.113
<i>We have reason to believe that
there are known homosexualists</i>

01:45:21.115 --> 01:45:24.116
<i>and a confirmed lesbo</i>
<i>inside these premises</i>

01:45:24.118 --> 01:45:26.752
<i>and that they are armed</i>
<i>with sewing machines</i>

01:45:26.754 --> 01:45:28.054
<i>and glitter.</i>

01:45:31.124 --> 01:45:32.425
<i>A-ha.</i>

01:45:32.427 --> 01:45:35.227
<i>Now that you have made</i>
<i>yourselves known to me,</i>

01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:38.464
<i>I have a question for the
notorious accrington sodomite</i>

01:45:38.466 --> 01:45:39.832
<i>known as Mike Jackson.</i>

01:45:39.834 --> 01:45:41.133
Will you please put that down?

01:45:41.135 --> 01:45:42.668
We have a very good relationship
with our neighbors.

01:45:42.670 --> 01:45:44.503
<i>Mike.</i>

01:45:46.808 --> 01:45:48.074
<i>Mike.</i>

01:45:57.918 --> 01:45:59.885
<i>I behaved like a prick before.</i>

01:46:01.755 --> 01:46:04.090
<i>Do you forgive me?</i>

01:46:05.425 --> 01:46:09.261
Just... just get up here
and sew something, will you?

01:46:22.943 --> 01:46:24.443
There you go, bromley.

01:46:26.847 --> 01:46:28.347
Happy Birthday.

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.367
Thank you.

01:46:50.637 --> 01:46:53.272
Right. Now, get to work.

01:46:54.674 --> 01:46:56.754
And
just for future reference...

01:46:58.645 --> 01:47:00.146
My name's Joe.

01:47:00.148 --> 01:47:02.581
You tell 'em, bromley.

01:47:02.583 --> 01:47:06.552
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

01:47:06.554 --> 01:47:09.255
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!

01:47:09.257 --> 01:47:13.926
Bromley! Bromley!
Bromley! Bromley!

01:47:13.928 --> 01:47:16.562
Bromley! Bromley! Bromley!
Bromley! Bromley!

01:47:30.610 --> 01:47:33.112
Oi, haven't you heard
about the miners, dearie?

01:47:35.015 --> 01:47:36.315
They lost.

01:47:39.419 --> 01:47:41.187
Have you heard? No politics.
What?

01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:43.122
Mark's over with the steward now.
No politics?

01:47:43.124 --> 01:47:44.590
No slogans.

01:47:44.592 --> 01:47:45.832
We're a mardi gras, apparently.

01:47:49.029 --> 01:47:50.095
There was a general feeling...
Amongst who?

01:47:50.097 --> 01:47:51.630
Amongst the committee

01:47:51.632 --> 01:47:53.265
that people have become tired
of politics and that this year,

01:47:53.267 --> 01:47:55.301
the tone should be celebratory.

01:47:55.303 --> 01:47:56.902
With affirmative slogans
and a positive atmosphere.

01:47:56.904 --> 01:47:58.204
Horse shit.
If you insist on marching

01:47:58.206 --> 01:47:59.572
with your banner,
you'll have to march

01:47:59.574 --> 01:48:00.906
at the back with
the fringe groups.

01:48:00.908 --> 01:48:02.875
Mate, we're lgsm. We fought
alongside the miners.

01:48:02.877 --> 01:48:04.877
Congratulations. But now
it's time for a party.

01:48:04.879 --> 01:48:06.912
What? Bollocks.

01:48:06.914 --> 01:48:08.881
<i>Complete and utter bollocks.</i>

01:48:08.883 --> 01:48:10.216
What's lgsm's position?

01:48:10.218 --> 01:48:11.450
We're going to march.

01:48:11.452 --> 01:48:13.118
Yes, but with banners or without?
With.

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.087
With. This is
a fucking demonstration.

01:48:15.089 --> 01:48:17.556
That's why we've decided to lead
the fringe groups at the back.

01:48:17.558 --> 01:48:18.891
Why would you be leading it?
Sorry?

01:48:18.893 --> 01:48:20.459
I'm not getting rid of the banner.
Listen...

01:48:20.461 --> 01:48:21.994
There's got to be
some kind of compromise.

01:48:21.996 --> 01:48:23.062
Why?

01:48:23.064 --> 01:48:24.463
Because that's the way
you get things done.

01:48:24.465 --> 01:48:25.965
No, it fucking isn't.
Listen.

01:48:25.967 --> 01:48:28.901
Why does everything get so
aggressive with you lot?

01:48:28.903 --> 01:48:30.669
Listen to me! Listen to me.

01:48:30.671 --> 01:48:32.771
Whether we march
with banners or without,

01:48:32.773 --> 01:48:35.508
the important thing is that
we march together, all of us.

01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:37.943
That's what this whole thing has
been about since the beginning

01:48:37.945 --> 01:48:40.312
and that is absolutely
how it is going to end.

01:48:40.314 --> 01:48:42.615
Together, us united.

01:48:42.617 --> 01:48:43.749
Bloody hell.

01:48:54.494 --> 01:48:56.061
Ah, yeah!

01:48:56.063 --> 01:48:57.530
I can't believe you're here.

01:48:57.532 --> 01:48:58.964
I can't believe you're here.

01:48:58.966 --> 01:49:00.332
All right?

01:49:00.334 --> 01:49:04.003
Where are my lesbians?
Where are my lesbians?

01:49:04.005 --> 01:49:05.538
Hi. Hey.

01:49:07.474 --> 01:49:09.508
Hi!

01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:13.946
These are all cucumber. No butter.
Stork sb every one.

01:49:13.948 --> 01:49:15.614
I can't believe you came.
Miners, see?

01:49:15.616 --> 01:49:16.982
We love a bloody good march.

01:49:16.984 --> 01:49:18.317
Right, where do you want us?

01:49:18.319 --> 01:49:19.818
You lot.
I'll tell them.

01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:20.886
There's too many of you.

01:49:20.888 --> 01:49:22.254
What?

01:49:22.256 --> 01:49:24.356
You'll have to go to the front.
You'll have to lead.

01:49:24.358 --> 01:49:26.358
We're not losing our banners, mate.
What do you mean...

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.426
What's he mean, too many?

01:49:27.428 --> 01:49:28.494
What's he on about?

01:49:29.529 --> 01:49:31.030
I think he means them.

01:49:46.413 --> 01:49:49.181

01:50:17.044 --> 01:50:20.713
The gays and lesbians have
been absolutely magnificent,

01:50:20.715 --> 01:50:22.114
there's no other word for it.

01:50:22.116 --> 01:50:23.449
You must have
found it a bit weird.

01:50:23.451 --> 01:50:26.452
A load of gays and lesbians
descending on you like that?

01:50:26.454 --> 01:50:29.154
Why on earth would we
have found that weird?

01:50:37.731 --> 01:50:39.098
<i>This way, guys.</i>
<i>We're at the front.</i>

01:50:40.401 --> 01:50:43.402
<i>Come on, guys.</i>
<i>We're at the front. This way.</i>

01:50:56.650 --> 01:50:59.284
Not worried about being
too visible this time?

01:50:59.286 --> 01:51:00.452
Shut up and march.

01:51:33.586 --> 01:51:36.522
<i>¶ There is power in a factory</i>

01:51:36.524 --> 01:51:39.024

01:51:43.798 --> 01:51:46.098
<i>¶ but it all amounts to nothing</i>

01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:49.201
