LAINEY:
High school friendships
are some of the most

00:03.133 --> 00:04.482
meaningful of our lives.

00:04.526 --> 00:06.310
And before Facebook
or Instagram,

00:06.354 --> 00:09.792
one of the only ways to check in with your classmates was the high school reunion.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.708
Holy crap, it's you!

00:16.929 --> 00:18.975
Oh.
Aah! Oh, man!

00:19.019 --> 00:21.543
I have six days until Nana
does my laundry.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.675
That's basically everything
I need to know about him.

00:23.719 --> 00:26.287
And you must be
the infamous Erica Goldberg.

00:26.330 --> 00:29.768
And you must be
the infamous Bobby McNope?

00:29.812 --> 00:30.987
I have no idea
who you are.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.336
See, I don't know what
goes on around here,

00:32.380 --> 00:34.077
because Lainey never
returns my calls.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.122
Well,
what is there to say?

00:35.165 --> 00:36.993
Kids hold clarinets
and stare at me blankly.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.081
Boom!
You're caught up.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.127
Come on, I miss you!

00:40.170 --> 00:41.824
And look at you
all teachered up,

00:41.867 --> 00:44.087
hanging
in the teachers' lounge,
crushing it teacher style!

00:44.131 --> 00:46.220
Aw, you're such
a sweet friend,

00:46.263 --> 00:48.309
pretending my life isn't
a hot sack of disappointment.

00:48.352 --> 00:50.311
Whoa, hey, don't be
so hard on yourself.

00:50.354 --> 00:52.530
I mean, it's not like
my life is any better.

00:52.574 --> 00:53.792

you and Geoff?

Don't get me started.

Wow. This got real sad
real fast.

Hey, hey, hey!
There they are!

and raising hell!

01:01.148 --> 01:04.020
So, reunion time.
Pretty exciting, huh?

01:04.064 --> 01:05.456
Absolutely not.
Dear God, no.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.806
I just went to my 30th,
and everyone looked great.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.808
I mean, Jesus has taken
most of the cheerleaders

01:09.852 --> 01:11.071
up to Heaven,
but I had fun!

01:11.114 --> 01:13.160
Sounds like a blast,
but me and Erica

01:13.203 --> 01:15.205
were planning
to ditch the whole
thing and go to Buckets.

01:15.249 --> 01:18.774
Oh, no! But we just
secured a banquet room
at Stazi Milano's!

01:18.817 --> 01:21.951
It's an Italian restaurant
built into the Jenkintown
train station.

01:21.994 --> 01:24.040
It's fancy because
you can see trains go by.

Sharing fried squid with
a bunch of high school nerds?
No, thank you.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.480
I'll have you know some
of those nerds have done
very well for themselves.

in an investment fund.

the stories he has.

Forget that drip!

There's only one human man
attending this reunion
who really matters,

01:40.448 --> 01:43.494
and that's Ruben Amaro Jr.,
who led the Phillies
to the World Series.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.279
Big deal. They lost.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.237

the World Series.

of the teachers' lounge

01:52.286 --> 01:53.417
has worn off
quite quickly.
