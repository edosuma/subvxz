00:52.121 --> 00:54.951
You asshole, Archie. That really hurt.

00:54.985 --> 00:57.160
What have you got in that bloody toy gun?

00:57.195 --> 00:58.506
- It's a normal cartridge.

00:58.541 --> 01:00.784
It shouldn't do that and it ain't no toy.

01:10.242 --> 01:12.072
It's made of stone.

01:12.106 --> 01:15.075
It's hollow, like an old
drainpipe or a chimney.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.628
I wonder what's down there.

01:16.662 --> 01:18.112
- Probably just a sewer.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.369
Come and have a look
at this, Archie.

01:53.872 --> 01:54.700
Well?

01:54.735 --> 01:55.805
- It's a trap door.

01:55.839 --> 01:57.013
- We going to open it?

01:57.047 --> 01:58.428
- Well, we've come this far.

02:11.407 --> 02:12.477
- Bloody hell, mate.

02:21.969 --> 02:23.833
I ain't going down there.

02:23.867 --> 02:25.662
Anyway, it's too dark.

02:25.697 --> 02:29.356
- As it happens,
I brought a torch.

02:29.390 --> 02:30.598
- What'd
you bring that for?

02:30.633 --> 02:32.186
- I thought it might
be dark in the woods.

02:32.221 --> 02:33.601
- You're crazy.

02:33.636 --> 02:34.947
You're even more crazy
if you're thinking

02:34.982 --> 02:36.190
of going down there.

02:36.225 --> 02:37.847
- Ah where's your
sense of adventure?

02:41.816 --> 02:43.163
- You'd better take this then.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.923
Might be a bear down there.

02:44.957 --> 02:47.960
- Ha ha, very funny.

02:58.764 --> 02:59.765
Shit!

02:59.800 --> 03:00.697
- What you done?

03:00.732 --> 03:01.940
- Nothing.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.528
Just be careful of the
bottom of the ladder

03:03.562 --> 03:04.839
when you come down.

03:04.874 --> 03:07.394
- I told you, I ain't
coming down there.

03:25.343 --> 03:26.965
- It's a great big
room full of stuff.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.622
Come and have a look.

04:02.966 --> 04:05.279
We better get out of here.

07:18.058 --> 07:19.508
- Anything?

07:19.542 --> 07:22.027
- Not much of any help at
all in identifying him.

07:22.062 --> 07:23.788
He's garbled on about a friend

07:23.822 --> 07:25.375
and some sort of
hideout in the woods

07:25.410 --> 07:26.446
but that's about all.

07:27.654 --> 07:29.966
- He looks a bit old
for hide-and-seek games.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.383
Well, all we can do is
something to turn up

07:33.418 --> 07:35.040
from missing persons.

07:35.075 --> 07:36.870
- Can you take over
here for awhile?

07:37.802 --> 07:39.769
- Uh, why?

07:39.804 --> 07:42.427
- He's really agitated and
mumbling about his friend

07:42.462 --> 07:43.670
so I thought I might take a look

07:43.704 --> 07:45.430
at the site of the
accident just in case

07:45.465 --> 07:47.536
there's another boy injured
or in need of help there.

07:47.570 --> 07:49.158
- Well, the place
was still swarming

07:49.192 --> 07:51.678
with accident investigators
questioning witnesses,

07:51.712 --> 07:53.680
measuring skid
marks when I left.

07:56.199 --> 07:58.685
But if it makes you
feel better, go ahead.

07:58.719 --> 08:00.514
- Thanks, Sarge.

10:13.198 --> 10:16.167
- The body of the female
police officer was discovered

10:16.201 --> 10:18.238
in the early hours
after a search

10:18.272 --> 10:21.206
after she failed to report
back to her station.

10:21.241 --> 10:22.207
The police say suicide--

10:22.242 --> 10:23.070
- Good morning.

10:23.105 --> 10:24.624
- Good morning, Linda.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.556
- Or revealed how
the officer died.

10:27.730 --> 10:29.490
The police are also
still trying to trace

10:29.525 --> 10:30.768
what they believe may be

10:30.802 --> 10:32.666
a missing teenage boy.
- Oh, I hate that.

10:32.701 --> 10:34.841
- Bloody bastards.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.118
I bet they had something to do

10:36.152 --> 10:38.223
with that poor police
girl being killed.

10:38.258 --> 10:39.362
- In the
critical condition.

10:39.397 --> 10:40.709
- What you saying, Ethel?

10:42.020 --> 10:43.125
- As to whether
the two incidents

10:43.159 --> 10:44.091
are connected.
- That poor police girl

10:44.126 --> 10:45.368
what was killed, I bet they had

10:45.403 --> 10:46.059
something to with it.
- We'll report more news

10:46.093 --> 10:47.336
when we have it.

10:47.370 --> 10:49.441
Now, here's Joan
with the weather.

11:09.323 --> 11:12.775
- Sergeant Unwin, have
they found anything?

11:14.812 --> 11:16.330
- No, sir.

11:16.365 --> 11:17.953
- And the undergrowth's
making a ground search

11:17.987 --> 11:19.851
nigh on impossible.

11:30.793 --> 11:34.107
- Look,
something's here, sir.

11:38.318 --> 11:42.115
- Well done, a spent
shotgun cartridge.

11:42.149 --> 11:44.945
Probably used by
someone shooting vermin

11:44.980 --> 11:47.948
and nothing whatsoever
to do with the murder

11:47.983 --> 11:50.157
seeings as Bates was
strangled with wire

11:51.331 --> 11:53.402
that was obviously so violent

11:53.436 --> 11:55.542
nearly severed her head
clear off.

11:55.576 --> 11:57.371
So no, no gun was involved.

11:58.994 --> 12:00.892
Oh, sorry, Unwin, I understand
you were the last officer

12:00.927 --> 12:02.652
to see her alive.

12:02.687 --> 12:04.033
- She was on my team.

12:04.068 --> 12:06.553
- Hmm, well seeing as
you're being transferred

12:06.587 --> 12:09.038
to plain clothes detectives
division tomorrow,

12:09.073 --> 12:11.109
you might be instrumental
in finding her murderer.

12:11.144 --> 12:12.732
Who you working with?

12:12.766 --> 12:14.699
- Detective Inspector Huntley.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.287
- The new girl.

12:16.321 --> 12:19.393
Well, if you encounter
any difficulties,

12:19.428 --> 12:21.016
pop by my office.

12:21.050 --> 12:22.569
Door's always open
to colleagues.

12:23.777 --> 12:24.674
- I'll get forensics
to take a look

12:24.709 --> 12:26.815
at the cartridge case, sir.

12:26.849 --> 12:29.783
- Yeah, you can do, but I
think it's a waste of time.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.682
I'm calling off this search.

12:32.717 --> 12:36.065
We've moved too far from
where the body was discovered.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.480
This is getting us nowhere.

13:20.454 --> 13:22.180
- Watch should be able to.

13:23.941 --> 13:25.287
- No, thank you.

14:36.254 --> 14:37.152
- What?

14:37.186 --> 14:38.878
No progress at all?

14:38.912 --> 14:41.466
Surely you must've been
able to get somewhere.

14:41.501 --> 14:43.434
I've got a murdered policewoman

14:43.468 --> 14:46.264
and now a forensic officer
who's apparently disappeared

14:46.299 --> 14:48.059
not to mention a missing youth

14:48.094 --> 14:50.959
and anther who's in a coma
because of a traffic accident.

14:50.993 --> 14:52.581
What the hell is going on here?

14:52.615 --> 14:54.721
- I've got every single
available officer

14:54.755 --> 14:57.413
back out combing the woods,
but it's a massive area

14:57.448 --> 14:58.656
and it's the weekend.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.071
I can't keep the whole
thing cordoned off.

15:02.315 --> 15:03.764
- Sorry to disturb you, ma'am,

15:03.799 --> 15:05.870
but there's been a development
and I think Inspector Reed

15:05.905 --> 15:06.940
should take the call.

15:06.975 --> 15:08.114
- Put it through.

15:08.148 --> 15:09.149
He can take it
here in my office.

15:10.737 --> 15:12.739
And what about this
presumed missing friend?

15:12.773 --> 15:15.500
- You'd think the parents
would've come forward by now.

15:15.535 --> 15:17.226
Think they'd notice
their child's missing.

15:17.261 --> 15:19.021
- I think most
parents have given up

15:19.056 --> 15:20.436
trying to keep
track of their kids

15:20.471 --> 15:22.059
by the time they're
teenagers, Huntley, but, uh,

15:23.577 --> 15:25.648
you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

15:25.683 --> 15:26.511
Reed.

15:28.997 --> 15:29.859
Where?

15:31.965 --> 15:32.793
Okay.

15:34.554 --> 15:35.969
Search team have
found another body.

15:36.004 --> 15:38.627
They're pretty certain
it's the forensics officer.

15:38.661 --> 15:41.457
But it was found in undergrowth
way over the other side

15:41.492 --> 15:43.873
of the forest from where
WPC Bates was found.

15:46.048 --> 15:47.256
- Cause of death?

15:47.291 --> 15:48.844
- Likely to have
been a stabbing.

16:00.580 --> 16:01.788
- That's right
Detective Inspector,

16:01.822 --> 16:03.583
she was stabbed
through the heart.

16:03.617 --> 16:06.241
Probably died instantly.

16:06.275 --> 16:07.967
Oh, and there was
something else.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.451
- What's that?

16:09.485 --> 16:11.971
- The matter most certainly
knew what he or she was doing.

16:12.833 --> 16:14.145
- Premeditated?

16:14.180 --> 16:17.804
- Possibly, but whoever
did this was in control

16:17.838 --> 16:19.012
and very clever.

16:19.047 --> 16:21.463
- Professional hit not
a crime of passion.

16:21.497 --> 16:24.052
- Well, he was certainly
somebody with training.

16:24.086 --> 16:26.537
You see the knife wound entry
was in exactly the right place

16:26.571 --> 16:28.125
to pierce the heart
with the knife.

16:28.159 --> 16:30.472
But the knife remained in
the body and was only removed

16:30.506 --> 16:32.129
after the remains were hidden.

16:32.163 --> 16:33.371
- Meaning?

16:33.406 --> 16:34.786
- Well, no trail of
blood to indicate

16:34.821 --> 16:37.134
where the murder
actually took place.

16:37.168 --> 16:39.412
Could've been anywhere
in the woods really,

16:39.446 --> 16:42.760
but most certainly not
where the victim was found.

16:46.729 --> 16:47.730
- Are you all right?

16:49.525 --> 16:50.802
- Yeah, I am.

16:52.908 --> 16:55.531
I was training her up to
take over my job.

16:57.223 --> 16:58.569
You just make sure
you get the bastard

16:58.603 --> 17:00.433
who did this and quick.

17:01.434 --> 17:02.435
- We'll do our best.

17:07.957 --> 17:09.925
Well, Detective Sergeant,
find out anything

17:09.959 --> 17:12.410
that can help us
catch the murderer?

17:12.444 --> 17:15.586
- Well, I reckon we gotta be
dealing with a serial killer

17:15.619 --> 17:17.036
who's targeting policewomen.

17:18.382 --> 17:20.625
Could be someone must
closer than we think, ma'am.

17:21.799 --> 17:23.835
- You can call me
governor, boss,

17:23.869 --> 17:25.837
anything you like except ma'am.

17:32.154 --> 17:34.432
- And now over to our
reporter Jeff Jacobs

17:34.467 --> 17:35.951
who is on the scene.

17:35.985 --> 17:37.539
Jeff, can you tell us any
more about what appears

17:37.573 --> 17:41.612
to be a double murder of
two female police officers?

17:41.646 --> 17:43.407
- Not very much I'm afraid.

17:43.441 --> 17:46.065
The police are giving out
very little information

17:46.099 --> 17:48.584
at present, but they have said

17:48.619 --> 17:50.724
that they will make a
statement to the media

17:50.759 --> 17:53.417
probably sometime
this afternoon.

17:53.451 --> 17:54.590
- Jack, Jack.
- Well that was Jeff Jacobs

17:54.625 --> 17:56.144
reporting on what
appears to be the scene

17:56.178 --> 17:57.800
of an extremely violent
- Do you want more tea?

17:57.835 --> 18:00.355
double murder in Shafton Forest

18:00.389 --> 18:01.494
near the village

18:01.528 --> 18:03.012
of Lower Pendlesham.
- Oh, Jack!

18:03.047 --> 18:03.875
- What's wrong?

18:03.910 --> 18:05.118
Are you okay.

18:05.153 --> 18:09.122
- Losing his
marbles if you ask me.

18:09.157 --> 18:11.193
- That's his latest
school photo.

18:11.228 --> 18:12.953
Would you like me to
look for some more?

18:12.988 --> 18:14.472
- No, this'll be fine for now.

18:16.267 --> 18:18.752
Is there any other
information you can give us

18:18.787 --> 18:20.133
about where he could've gone?

18:21.307 --> 18:23.585
- We just don't
know officer.

18:25.966 --> 18:29.038
- Okay, shall we start with
when you first discovered

18:29.073 --> 18:30.523
he was missing?

18:30.557 --> 18:33.008
- When he didn't come down for
breakfast yesterday morning.

18:33.042 --> 18:35.286
- And you didn't think to
report him missing earlier?

18:35.321 --> 18:37.219
- He said he was going
out with his friend Vince

18:37.254 --> 18:40.429
and that he might be late
home so not to wait up.

18:40.464 --> 18:42.017
He's a teenager.

18:42.051 --> 18:44.053
These days they do
their own thing.

18:44.088 --> 18:47.333
- And when Archie left,
did he give any indication

18:47.367 --> 18:48.920
as to where he and
Vince were going

18:48.955 --> 18:50.612
or if anyone else was involved?

18:52.061 --> 18:53.442
- I'm sorry, I've got to
ask, is there any friction

18:53.477 --> 18:55.824
between you, an argument
that could've caused him

18:55.858 --> 18:56.894
to run away?

18:56.928 --> 18:58.206
- Certainly not.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.898
- Archie is a good boy.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.279
He wouldn't harm a soul.

19:04.798 --> 19:06.110
- We'll see ourselves out.

19:07.663 --> 19:09.976
Call us immediately if
you hear from Archie.

19:19.675 --> 19:21.746
- But we've already
searched the forest.

19:21.781 --> 19:23.576
- I've got the police
and crime commissioners

19:23.610 --> 19:25.750
breathing down my
neck demanding answers

19:25.785 --> 19:27.442
so search it again.

19:27.476 --> 19:29.754
- Well, I'm guessing
DI Huntley and her team

19:29.789 --> 19:30.997
have come up with nothing.

19:31.031 --> 19:33.862
- They're busy gathering
relevant information.

19:33.896 --> 19:36.658
- Well, maybe her new
sergeant can help you.

19:37.555 --> 19:39.005
- How do you mean?

19:39.039 --> 19:41.007
- Well, what I can gather
he's the last officer

19:41.041 --> 19:42.698
to see both of
the victims alive.

20:12.349 --> 20:14.213
- We'll never
find it in there.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.731
- We best get Dad.

20:25.396 --> 20:27.605
- Dad, Dad, did you see
the thing in the woods?

20:27.640 --> 20:28.951
- What you talking about?

20:28.986 --> 20:31.126
- It kicked our football back.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.128
- It was like funny man.

20:34.302 --> 20:36.235
- Well, you better
go and take a look.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.237
You hear some strange
stories these days.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.135
Nobody's safe.

20:41.792 --> 20:42.862
- There's nothing there.

20:42.896 --> 20:45.830
You're all exaggerating
or dreaming.

20:45.865 --> 20:47.936
- Then how did our
football come back out?

20:59.499 --> 21:01.225
- Sorry folks, you're gonna
have to leave the area.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.606
We're bringing up a police
cordon round the forest

21:02.640 --> 21:04.159
and there's about to
be a major search here,

21:04.193 --> 21:06.748
so can you return
to your car please?

21:06.782 --> 21:08.715
- Are you looking
for the funny man?

21:08.750 --> 21:10.199
- Funny man?

21:10.234 --> 21:12.201
- Uh, I'm sorry, Officer,
they thought they saw someone

21:12.236 --> 21:13.651
in the trees.

21:13.686 --> 21:14.583
They have a vivid imagination.

21:14.618 --> 21:16.620
- He kicked our football back.

21:16.654 --> 21:20.037
- He has a mouth
there made of dust.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.866
- We're very sorry for
the inconvenience, guys.

21:21.901 --> 21:25.007
- Not even allowed to go
for a picnic in the park?

21:25.042 --> 21:26.975
Bloody Gestapo.

21:27.009 --> 21:27.872
- Thank you, sir.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.910
Wanna go take a look?

21:30.944 --> 21:32.912
Just in case the kids
actually did see something.

21:32.946 --> 21:34.120
- We better check it out.

21:34.154 --> 21:35.604
- Come on.

21:56.349 --> 21:57.557
What do we have?

21:57.592 --> 21:58.834
- Yeah, a couple of kids
claim they saw something

21:58.869 --> 22:00.353
in the woods so
we're taking a look.

22:01.872 --> 22:03.667
Probably a wild goose chase
but you never know, out.

23:09.767 --> 23:11.459
- Wasting our time, mate.

23:11.493 --> 23:12.770
- Yep.

23:12.805 --> 23:14.427
- There's nothing here.

23:17.775 --> 23:19.812
Kids were imagining things.

23:22.987 --> 23:25.300
- No, ja!

24:31.435 --> 24:33.195
- You need to see this.

24:33.230 --> 24:35.059
Intestines have been
cut away and laid out

24:35.094 --> 24:36.716
like some sort of ritual murder.

24:39.408 --> 24:41.687
I think we may have a
new Ripper on our hands.

25:13.822 --> 25:14.754
- Apart from
the heat signatures

25:14.789 --> 25:16.584
of the odd deer and vermin

25:16.618 --> 25:19.310
there is definitely
nothing alive down there.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.555
- Well, we interrupt
our story to go live now

26:31.590 --> 26:34.385
to Lower Pendlesham
where a police spokesman

26:34.420 --> 26:36.595
is about to give a
press conference.

26:36.629 --> 26:39.080
- We have so far recovered
four bodies from the woods

26:39.114 --> 26:41.772
all of them serving police
officers from various spectrums

26:41.807 --> 26:42.877
of the force.
- Here, this in the paper.

26:42.911 --> 26:44.119
- And all of them--

26:44.154 --> 26:46.605
- They write must been
a massacre in the woods.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.952
- Can you give us more details
of these murder victims

26:48.986 --> 26:50.436
and how they were
actually killed?

26:50.470 --> 26:53.197
- Hope they dump off some
more of them foreign tourists.

26:53.232 --> 26:54.405
- Have you made
or are close to making

26:54.440 --> 26:55.234
any arrests?
- Ethel, I think

26:55.268 --> 26:56.649
you mean terrorists.

26:56.684 --> 26:58.409
- Is there any connection
between the murders

26:58.444 --> 27:00.480
and the missing teenager?

27:00.515 --> 27:02.413
- I'm sorry, we're gonna
have to leave it there

27:02.448 --> 27:04.105
as I can't reveal any
more at this moment.

27:04.139 --> 27:06.659
This is an ongoing
investigation.

27:06.694 --> 27:08.212
- Can you
just confirm the rumor

27:08.247 --> 27:09.558
- Jack, are you all right?
- that as the perpetrator

27:09.593 --> 27:11.526
seems able to slip
through your net,

27:11.560 --> 27:13.321
this is not the work of a gang,

27:13.355 --> 27:15.599
but a trained lone
hit man or insurgent

27:15.634 --> 27:18.153
who has local knowledge
of Shafton Forest?

27:27.369 --> 27:29.061
- Any comments on that?

27:29.095 --> 27:31.235
- The reporter could be right.

27:31.270 --> 27:33.928
I reckon we're dealing with
a loner type, an anarchist,

27:33.962 --> 27:36.724
hermit who thinks themselves
a resistance fighter.

27:36.758 --> 27:39.347
- Maybe this guy isn't even
living rough in the forest.

27:39.381 --> 27:40.486
Maybe he lives nearby

27:40.520 --> 27:41.556
with enough local knowledge

27:41.590 --> 27:42.868
to give us the slip.

27:42.902 --> 27:44.317
Might be somebody
working on the land

27:44.352 --> 27:46.457
and living amongst
the farming community.

27:46.492 --> 27:48.149
- I agree with that comment.

27:48.183 --> 27:50.876
It's gotta be someone
with local knowledge.

27:50.910 --> 27:53.154
- Okay, here's the plan.

27:53.188 --> 27:56.398
We're gonna seal off all
roads around Shafton Forest

27:56.433 --> 27:59.229
and question any motorists
who go through regularly

27:59.263 --> 28:00.989
on if they've seen
anything suspicious

28:01.024 --> 28:03.026
that could help us
with our inquiries.

28:03.060 --> 28:05.994
At the same time, we're gonna
visit all rural properties

28:06.029 --> 28:08.445
and ask the inhabitants
along the same lines.

28:09.860 --> 28:12.380
DS Unwin will allocate you
all your various assignments

28:12.414 --> 28:14.244
and please be careful.

28:15.624 --> 28:17.005
We're after a cop killer.

28:26.256 --> 28:28.085
- So he has no allergies
that you're aware of

28:28.120 --> 28:28.948
or anything like that?

28:28.983 --> 28:30.294
Okay.

28:30.329 --> 28:31.226
We--

28:31.261 --> 28:32.711
- Any new developments, Doctor?

28:33.781 --> 28:35.610
- He came round briefly earlier,

28:35.644 --> 28:37.646
but we're trying to keep
him in a sedated state.

28:37.681 --> 28:39.648
- Did he say anything?

28:39.683 --> 28:41.478
- Nothing coherent or sensible.

28:42.893 --> 28:45.482
He sort of sat up in a panic
and had to be restrained.

28:47.001 --> 28:50.970
Kept screaming something
like, "Get it away from me,"

28:51.005 --> 28:52.903
over and over again.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.230
- I've been showing
these police officers

29:09.264 --> 29:10.403
our priest hole.

29:10.438 --> 29:12.543
- Yeah, very interesting.

29:15.167 --> 29:17.445
- They're here because of
the goings on in the forest.

29:17.479 --> 29:18.860
Wondered if we'd seen
or heard anything

29:18.895 --> 29:20.586
unusual or suspicious.

29:22.070 --> 29:22.899
- No.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.009
Sorry, can't help you.

29:30.976 --> 29:32.598
We've not seen or heard nothing.

29:36.015 --> 29:38.190
- I really think we
ought to tell them

29:38.224 --> 29:40.744
especially how serious
it is with these murders.

29:40.779 --> 29:41.607
- Tell us what?

29:43.022 --> 29:45.197
I have to warn you if you're
in any way aiding or abetting

29:45.231 --> 29:47.337
a criminal in a
case of this nature,

29:47.371 --> 29:49.753
the consequences for
you will be very dire.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.652
- Have you been giving
someone food or shelter?

29:52.687 --> 29:54.793
Or has anybody stolen
an animal from you

29:54.827 --> 29:55.828
perhaps to kill and eat?

29:55.863 --> 29:57.554
- Oh no, nothing like that.

29:57.588 --> 30:01.282
- Fuel, large drum of petrol.

30:01.316 --> 30:02.870
- What about it?

30:02.904 --> 30:07.081
- Well, I'm allowed to
keep diesel, petrol, oil

30:07.115 --> 30:11.085
for tractors and machines
in proper tanks for safety.

30:11.119 --> 30:12.603
- And we keep a few drums
at the back of the barn

30:12.638 --> 30:15.814
for our own use which
is against regulations.

30:17.885 --> 30:21.095
- We're not gonna grass my
mate up at the petrol station

30:21.129 --> 30:22.717
who supplies me.

30:22.751 --> 30:24.823
- So what are you saying?

30:24.857 --> 30:27.480
- One of the drums went
missing last night.

30:27.515 --> 30:28.654
- Stolen?

30:28.688 --> 30:30.138
- Had to be.

30:30.173 --> 30:31.933
- Can you show
us where it was taken from?

30:31.968 --> 30:32.796
- Aye.

30:48.674 --> 30:50.814
There and one's missing.

30:52.436 --> 30:55.992
- Unlikely to be
connected to our main case.

30:57.545 --> 31:00.168
- Yeah, well, thanks very
much for your assistance.

31:00.203 --> 31:01.894
We won't be reporting this,

31:01.929 --> 31:04.932
but you should stick
to the rules in future.

31:06.347 --> 31:08.867
And please if you see
anything else suspicious,

31:08.901 --> 31:10.282
let us know.

31:10.316 --> 31:11.145
- Of course.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.569
- What do you make of that?

31:21.603 --> 31:23.157
- Someone probably saw
him unloading and decided

31:23.191 --> 31:24.537
to help themselves.

31:24.572 --> 31:26.056
Could be one of the neighbors.

31:27.057 --> 31:28.403
Let's check the next house.

31:43.039 --> 31:44.247
- Can I ask you

31:44.281 --> 31:45.351
to step from the
vehicle please, sir?

31:47.940 --> 31:49.597
Take the cab in please.

31:49.631 --> 31:51.357
- What's the problem?

31:55.292 --> 31:57.225
- I'll
only take a minute.

31:57.260 --> 31:58.709
Can I see it?

32:00.642 --> 32:01.989
Every day?

32:02.023 --> 32:03.887
Seen anything unusual?

32:05.578 --> 32:06.925
We should--

32:16.935 --> 32:19.834
- Get down on the
ground, get down.

32:23.286 --> 32:25.150
- The Home Secretary visited
the scene this afternoon

32:25.184 --> 32:26.979
and had this to say.

32:27.014 --> 32:28.498
- I promise you that
we will make sure

32:28.532 --> 32:31.673
that we bring the
perpetrators of these cowardly

32:31.708 --> 32:34.745
and despicable attacks
to face justice.

32:34.780 --> 32:35.988
- Home
Secretary, can you tell us

32:36.023 --> 32:37.748
if it's known who
was responsible?

32:37.783 --> 32:39.440
- I've just won
at Bingo.

32:41.683 --> 32:43.168
- Get, get out of the
way, Ethel, please.

32:43.202 --> 32:44.445
- There are
several insurgent groups--

32:44.479 --> 32:46.205
- Ethel, get out
of the bloody way!

32:46.240 --> 32:49.105
- Oh, all right, all right.

32:49.139 --> 32:51.072
You're not still
watching this rubbish.

32:51.107 --> 32:55.076
You'll get square eyes, you
will, watching 24-hour news

32:55.111 --> 32:56.905
on the loop.

32:56.940 --> 32:59.667
Besides, I wanna see my soap,
find out what's happening

32:59.701 --> 33:01.600
to the latest murder
in the Chiplin.

33:01.634 --> 33:04.016
- No, no, no, no, don't
change the channel!

33:04.051 --> 33:05.604
- No!
- I've gotta watch this.

33:05.638 --> 33:07.261
Ethel, Ethel, Ethel.

33:07.295 --> 33:09.401
Get her away, get her away!

33:09.435 --> 33:11.023
- Give someone else a turn.

33:11.058 --> 33:13.370
- I've got a twist
to that minister

33:13.405 --> 33:14.544
who was talking
on the television.

33:14.578 --> 33:15.786
- Yeah Jack, listen,
Ethel's right.

33:15.821 --> 33:17.271
You need to share
the television.

33:17.305 --> 33:19.998
- No, no, no, no, you've
got, you don't understand.

33:20.032 --> 33:22.276
I-I need to talk to the police.

33:22.310 --> 33:23.104
I--
- You've got to have him

33:23.139 --> 33:24.036
put away.

33:24.071 --> 33:25.969
He's getting violent.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.281
- Listen, listen.
- Jack, Jack.

33:27.315 --> 33:28.730
- You're not taking
this seriously.

33:28.765 --> 33:30.491
I've got to talk to the police.

33:30.525 --> 33:34.736
I've got to warn them
because he's back, he's back.

33:34.771 --> 33:35.565
- All right, all right.

33:36.428 --> 33:37.705
And it's my fault.

33:37.739 --> 33:40.052
Oh God, it's my fault.
- Okay, just...

33:48.854 --> 33:50.959
- So, not a
sophisticated device.

33:50.994 --> 33:52.133
- Not at all.

33:52.168 --> 33:53.824
Basically, it's a
large Molotov cocktail

33:53.859 --> 33:55.895
made by igniting a
canister of fuel.

33:55.930 --> 33:58.070
- Obviously there's no
clues to who made it.

33:58.105 --> 33:59.485
- Unless there's anything else,

33:59.520 --> 34:01.625
we need to get back to the
farm, question the farmer again

34:01.660 --> 34:02.902
about the missing fuel.

34:02.937 --> 34:04.421
- The technology for
this kind of device

34:04.456 --> 34:07.493
has been around for decades,
at least since World War II.

34:07.528 --> 34:09.944
Insurgents, rebels,
resistance fighters

34:09.978 --> 34:12.429
have been using this kind
of incendiary type bomb

34:12.464 --> 34:14.224
for a century or more.

34:14.259 --> 34:16.226
- Basically anyone
could've made it.

34:16.261 --> 34:17.952
- To be honest, there's
probably instructions for it

34:17.985 --> 34:19.126
on the internet.

34:19.159 --> 34:20.782
Anyone with a grudge
and bit of common sense

34:20.817 --> 34:21.851
could put this together.

34:21.887 --> 34:24.062
Teenage kids more than capable.

34:24.096 --> 34:25.649
- So maybe we should
a bit of pressure

34:25.684 --> 34:27.686
on the doctors to get
some more information

34:27.719 --> 34:29.583
out of that teenage
kid in the hospital.

34:29.619 --> 34:31.862
- Let's get back to the farm.

34:31.897 --> 34:33.864
- I'll look after
that for you then.

34:33.899 --> 34:36.556
Bit of old-fashioned police
pressure might not go amiss.

34:55.333 --> 34:56.163
- Hello.

34:57.543 --> 34:58.441
Anybody there?

34:59.338 --> 35:00.960
- Mrs. Roberts.

35:10.487 --> 35:11.868
- Let me.

35:11.902 --> 35:13.180
And go.

35:13.214 --> 35:14.664
Leave me alone.

35:16.873 --> 35:18.633
- This is the police.

35:18.668 --> 35:21.326
Throw the gun out and come out

35:21.360 --> 35:23.880
with both hands fully visible.

35:25.053 --> 35:26.779
- Should I call for
armed response units?

35:34.442 --> 35:35.271
- Okay.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.119
What's happened?

35:59.018 --> 36:01.055
- Don't let it get me.

36:01.089 --> 36:02.298
Help me.

36:02.332 --> 36:04.196
- Okay.
- Please help me.

36:04.231 --> 36:06.819
- Okay, whatever it was
it's gone now, you're safe.

36:06.854 --> 36:08.304
- You don't know.

36:08.338 --> 36:10.340
It might come back.

36:10.375 --> 36:12.239
- We're calling for backup.

36:12.273 --> 36:13.101
- Okay, I'll get on it.

36:13.136 --> 36:14.586
- No, no.

36:16.346 --> 36:19.073
- What is it that
scared you so much?

36:19.107 --> 36:21.834
- It was, it was like a man.

36:22.939 --> 36:26.218
- Okay.
- But he wasn't a man.

36:26.253 --> 36:29.187
He was a dead man.

36:30.084 --> 36:31.499
- Okay.

36:35.814 --> 36:38.092
- He was horrible, hideous.

36:40.336 --> 36:42.338
It was, it was floating,

36:45.272 --> 36:46.273
moving less.

36:48.378 --> 36:51.001
And it exposed both.

36:51.036 --> 36:54.764
And it didn't have a face,

36:54.798 --> 36:58.423
just a skull with
eyes in deep sockets.

36:58.457 --> 36:59.907
Oh my God.

36:59.941 --> 37:01.253
- Okay, okay.

37:01.288 --> 37:02.427
Where's your husband.

37:04.912 --> 37:06.638
It's all right.

37:06.672 --> 37:07.880
Let's get you into the house.

37:07.915 --> 37:08.709
Come on.

37:08.743 --> 37:09.951
Come on, up.

37:09.986 --> 37:11.159
- Calvary's on its way.

37:12.022 --> 37:13.265
- It's okay.

37:13.300 --> 37:14.991
The husband.

37:15.025 --> 37:15.854
Come on.

37:17.027 --> 37:19.651
Come on, let's get you
safe, come on, come on.

37:21.618 --> 37:22.757
It's okay.

37:22.792 --> 37:23.620
It's okay.

37:25.381 --> 37:26.244
We will.

38:03.695 --> 38:04.558
- Fuck!

38:30.722 --> 38:33.138
- See, there's nothing
out here to be afraid of.

39:52.355 --> 39:53.252
- Oh, fuck!

40:11.305 --> 40:12.996
- Are you all right, then, huh?

40:13.031 --> 40:14.066
What's going on?

40:14.101 --> 40:14.895
Everything all right?

40:19.762 --> 40:20.935
- If you could just give
me a few minutes with him

40:20.970 --> 40:22.454
and then put him back under.

40:22.489 --> 40:24.180
- The best chance for the
boy is for us to keep him

40:24.214 --> 40:26.424
in a state of sedated
unconsciousness

40:26.458 --> 40:27.908
and slowly bring him back.

40:27.942 --> 40:30.082
It's a tried and
tested technique.

40:30.117 --> 40:32.878
- I understand
that, Doctor,

40:32.913 --> 40:34.328
but this kid could save lives

40:34.362 --> 40:35.916
and there's been a
lot of deaths already

40:35.950 --> 40:38.159
and anything he can tell me
about what happened to him

40:38.194 --> 40:40.472
in the woods could
prevent more deaths.

40:40.507 --> 40:43.130
- The risk to my patient
of attempting to revive him

40:43.164 --> 40:45.857
too early or too
quickly is too great.

40:45.891 --> 40:47.790
And anyway, how can you be
sure he has any information

40:47.824 --> 40:49.274
that might be of use to you?

40:49.308 --> 40:52.070
I'm not prepared to change
our medical procedure.

41:13.781 --> 41:16.197
- Well, this is a new one.

41:16.232 --> 41:17.509
What do you make of it?

41:17.544 --> 41:19.891
- You mean did she
create a fantasy story

41:19.925 --> 41:21.858
to hide the fact she
murdered her husband?

41:21.893 --> 41:23.481
- Well Unwin, you've
gotta admit her story

41:23.515 --> 41:25.137
is a little bit farfetched.

41:25.172 --> 41:27.346
- Well, she was pretty
distraught when we found her.

41:27.381 --> 41:29.314
- Well, she would be, wouldn't
she according to her story.

41:29.348 --> 41:31.730
Well, let's just recap shall we?

41:31.765 --> 41:35.976
A zombie came out of the
woods presumably to steal

41:36.010 --> 41:38.461
more petrol so it could
make another bomb.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.878
Her husband disturbed
it so it attacked him.

41:41.913 --> 41:44.432
She heard his screams
so she ran out

41:44.467 --> 41:46.538
carrying their shotgun
because she thought

41:46.573 --> 41:47.781
it would be a wild animal.

41:47.815 --> 41:50.438
She shoots the thing
which doesn't stop it

41:50.473 --> 41:53.372
so then she thinks
it's gonna attack her.

41:53.407 --> 41:56.548
So she cleverly runs away
and hides in the barn

41:56.583 --> 41:59.344
which worked because
it didn't find her.

41:59.378 --> 42:00.863
And then you two turn up.

42:00.897 --> 42:02.554
- Okay, it takes a
bit of believing,

42:02.589 --> 42:05.074
but whatever it was, it
certainly terrified her.

42:05.108 --> 42:07.386
- Come on, Huntley, you must've
heard a few tall stories

42:07.421 --> 42:09.009
when someone's trying
to cover up a murder

42:09.043 --> 42:10.942
even in your short
time in the job.

42:10.976 --> 42:13.531
You don't think that it's
too much of a coincidence

42:13.565 --> 42:16.499
that this creature buzzed off
just as you two detectives

42:16.534 --> 42:18.846
turned up thereby stopping her

42:18.881 --> 42:22.160
from disposing of her murdered
husband's body properly.

42:22.194 --> 42:23.920
- Have you seen the body, sir?

42:23.955 --> 42:24.749
- No.

42:24.783 --> 42:25.991
- No.

42:26.026 --> 42:27.268
- But I hear it's
pretty horrific.

42:27.303 --> 42:30.030
- Yeah, his neck
wasn't just broken.

42:30.064 --> 42:31.997
His head was almost torn off.

42:32.032 --> 42:34.034
- Yeah, and he was a big guy.

42:34.068 --> 42:36.623
I really don't think a woman
like her could've done that.

42:36.657 --> 42:38.590
- Well, maybe she
had an accomplice

42:38.625 --> 42:40.592
which is often the
case in a murder.

42:40.627 --> 42:42.318
A boyfriend perhaps which is why

42:42.352 --> 42:44.907
they wanted rid of the old
man in the first place.

42:44.941 --> 42:46.840
- Then why make up such
an unbelievable story?

42:46.874 --> 42:49.497
Why not blame it on
a wolf or a large cat

42:49.532 --> 42:51.292
or an escaped animal?

42:51.327 --> 42:52.777
Surely that's more plausible.

42:52.811 --> 42:56.021
- Oh, what, so you think that
she really did see a zombie?

42:56.056 --> 42:59.749
- Maybe she saw a man in a
skeletal mask, body armor,

42:59.784 --> 43:01.233
we don't know.

43:01.268 --> 43:04.167
- Thank you, Unwin, yeah,
you mean like a budget Batman

43:04.202 --> 43:06.066
that's turned bad.

43:06.100 --> 43:08.033
Listen, I'm not buying
any of it, okay?

43:08.068 --> 43:09.897
I want her under
guard in the hospital

43:09.932 --> 43:12.935
until we work out whether she's
committed an offense or not.

43:12.969 --> 43:15.178
Maybe then we can
release her probably

43:15.213 --> 43:16.870
straight to a
psychiatric hospital.

43:16.904 --> 43:18.596
- Have you forgotten that
what we're dealing with

43:18.630 --> 43:21.184
appears to be a mass
murderer cum terrorist

43:21.219 --> 43:23.152
who seems to be able to
disappear into the woods

43:23.186 --> 43:24.740
without a trace?

43:24.774 --> 43:27.777
This is not an isolated
domestic incident.

43:27.812 --> 43:31.988
- So you think that
someone or something

43:32.023 --> 43:35.267
really did come back
to get more petrol.

43:35.302 --> 43:36.752
- I'm not ruling it out.

43:36.786 --> 43:40.479
- Okay, and this
person or thing,

43:40.514 --> 43:44.276
you think is foolish enough

43:44.311 --> 43:46.071
to actually try it again.

43:46.106 --> 43:47.521
- Possibly.

43:47.555 --> 43:49.350
- In that case, I
think we should keep

43:49.385 --> 43:50.835
the whole place under guard.

43:50.869 --> 43:51.801
- I agree.

43:51.836 --> 43:52.664
- Good.

43:52.699 --> 43:53.907
Carry on.

43:53.941 --> 43:55.978
- Could be a potential
trap for the murderer.

44:10.026 --> 44:12.028
- So what do you make
of all this business?

44:12.063 --> 44:13.478
- What you mean?

44:13.512 --> 44:15.618
- Well, it's unlikely that
whoever tried to steal the fuel

44:15.653 --> 44:17.793
is gonna come back
for another go.

44:17.827 --> 44:19.346
Now, if we're meant to
be some sort of trap,

44:19.380 --> 44:21.451
I think we're wasting our time.

44:21.486 --> 44:24.006
- Well, could be we're some
sort of bait or something.

44:25.732 --> 44:28.010
- Not seriously
trying to tell me

44:28.044 --> 44:29.218
you believe all that rubbish

44:29.252 --> 44:30.702
about a bloke in a
gorilla suit, are you?

44:30.737 --> 44:32.842
- Ah, it might be a real
gorilla loose in the woods

44:32.877 --> 44:35.189
that escaped from
the zoo or something.

44:35.224 --> 44:36.743
- That's funny.

44:36.777 --> 44:37.709
Mind you I don't like the look

44:37.744 --> 44:39.297
of this fog that's developing.

44:41.161 --> 44:42.058
- Did you hear that?

44:42.921 --> 44:45.441
- Yes.

44:46.442 --> 44:47.546
Jesus.

44:47.581 --> 44:49.203
- You scared the shit out of us.

44:49.238 --> 44:51.240
- Sorry if we startled you boys.

44:51.274 --> 44:53.173
Just taking Kaiser
for a sniff around.

44:54.070 --> 44:56.728
Looking for anything suspicious.

44:56.763 --> 44:57.695
- And why is it you
dog squad people

44:57.729 --> 44:59.248
only ever use German Shepherds?

44:59.282 --> 45:01.077
- 'Cause they're the
best for the job.

45:02.044 --> 45:02.838
What's up, boy?

45:03.839 --> 45:04.702
What's up?

45:04.736 --> 45:06.289
Kaiser!

45:06.324 --> 45:07.463
Come back, Kaiser!

45:15.954 --> 45:16.886
No!

45:17.784 --> 45:18.716
Kaiser, no!

45:25.584 --> 45:26.413
Oh.

45:27.448 --> 45:28.864
- What the fuck was that?

45:30.969 --> 45:32.971
- Someone call
the air ambulance.

45:37.389 --> 45:38.736
- The dog
just ran into the fog

45:38.770 --> 45:40.220
and attacked something.

45:40.254 --> 45:42.118
- Could you
describe the assailant?

45:42.153 --> 45:46.157
- No, I mean we didn't
get a clear look.

45:54.096 --> 45:56.374
- Yeah, we better get
forensics down here again.

46:09.663 --> 46:12.735
Piece of material
from an army uniform?

46:12.770 --> 46:13.632
- An old one.

46:14.564 --> 46:15.703
- What you thinking?

46:15.738 --> 46:17.844
- Military fanatic?

46:17.878 --> 46:21.364
Could be a deserter trained
in guerrilla tactics.

46:21.399 --> 46:22.469
Should call the army.

46:27.612 --> 46:28.440
DI Huntley.

46:30.718 --> 46:32.582
Thank you, we're on our way.

46:32.617 --> 46:33.549
Let's go.

46:33.583 --> 46:34.792
- What's that?

46:34.826 --> 46:36.276
- The kid, Vince,
he's conscious.

46:36.310 --> 46:37.139
- And talking?

46:37.173 --> 46:38.036
- Seems so.

46:40.867 --> 46:42.144
I am sorry to hear the boy died.

46:43.662 --> 46:44.905
- We were told he'd
regained consciousness.

46:44.940 --> 46:46.562
- He came around, briefly.

46:46.596 --> 46:49.116
- Did he say anything when
he came out of his coma?

46:49.151 --> 46:51.187
- Anything about his
accident or what happened

46:51.222 --> 46:53.672
that might actually
be of use to us?

46:53.707 --> 46:55.778
- Well, I'm not sure
if this is of much help

46:55.813 --> 46:58.229
but he did mutter
something although he was

46:58.263 --> 46:59.920
in a state of delirium.

46:59.955 --> 47:01.266
- What, what did he say?

47:01.301 --> 47:03.199
- Well, I can't be
sure of the exact words

47:03.234 --> 47:06.824
but it seems that he
and his missing friend

47:06.858 --> 47:08.618
were in the woods
shooting rabbits

47:08.653 --> 47:11.690
with his friend's shotgun
when they discovered

47:11.725 --> 47:16.212
a secret underground chamber
filled with military equipment.

47:18.628 --> 47:20.458
Oh, there's something else.

47:20.492 --> 47:21.735
- What?

47:21.769 --> 47:23.426
- There was something in
that underground chamber

47:23.461 --> 47:26.119
that obviously terrified
the boy so much

47:26.153 --> 47:29.708
that it caused him to
run and that's what led

47:29.743 --> 47:30.882
to the road accident.

47:33.471 --> 47:37.095
- Yeah, I'm sorry, honey, but
you know how big this case is.

47:37.130 --> 47:41.030
There's just something
about it doesn't add up.

47:42.894 --> 47:45.172
Yeah, I know I missed
dinner last night as well

47:45.207 --> 47:48.727
but I can't just knock off,
especially with the new boss

47:48.762 --> 47:49.521
as my partner.

47:51.109 --> 47:52.939
Don't be ridiculous.

47:52.973 --> 47:55.251
And no, I'm not even
sure if she likes men

47:55.286 --> 47:56.874
if you know what I mean.

47:56.908 --> 47:58.013
Go, gotta go.

48:02.534 --> 48:04.709
Ah, so how'd it go in there?

48:04.743 --> 48:07.367
- Archie owned a shotgun.

48:07.401 --> 48:11.750
- Huh, so the boy Vince was
probably telling the truth

48:11.785 --> 48:13.511
about everything else
he said in his rambling.

48:13.545 --> 48:14.374
- Seems so.

48:15.651 --> 48:17.066
Any developments here?

48:17.101 --> 48:19.034
- Uh, army denies all
knowledge of any soldiers

48:19.068 --> 48:20.898
AWOL or deserting.

48:20.932 --> 48:22.071
- Well, at least we have an idea

48:22.106 --> 48:23.314
of what we might
be looking for now.

48:23.348 --> 48:24.867
- There was another
thing which I thought

48:24.902 --> 48:26.904
was a bit too much
for coincidence.

48:26.938 --> 48:28.112
- Go on.

48:28.146 --> 48:29.630
- One of the murder
investigation team

48:29.665 --> 48:32.323
took a call earlier from an
old geezer in a care home.

48:32.357 --> 48:34.014
He said it was essential
he speak to someone

48:34.049 --> 48:36.499
in authority because he
knew who was responsible

48:36.534 --> 48:38.018
for the attacks.

48:38.053 --> 48:39.502
- Why haven't we
followed this up already?

48:39.537 --> 48:41.884
- Well, it seems that
although the old guy

48:41.919 --> 48:44.576
managed to get to the phone,
the people looking after him

48:44.611 --> 48:46.199
were adamant he'd gone senile.

48:47.407 --> 48:48.649
- Okay, so why are
you telling me now

48:48.684 --> 48:50.582
if this is
just some crazy old guy

48:50.617 --> 48:52.412
who watches too much TV.

48:52.446 --> 48:55.001
- Because in his
call he mentioned

48:55.035 --> 48:57.796
about a so-called
underground operational base

48:57.831 --> 48:59.591
in Shafton Forest.

48:59.626 --> 49:01.593
And he talked about it
before the boy Vince

49:01.628 --> 49:03.492
got out with that information.

49:03.526 --> 49:05.356
So there's absolutely
no way the old boy

49:05.390 --> 49:07.875
could've heard about it from
anyone involved in the case.

49:07.910 --> 49:08.980
- Let's go talk to him.

49:09.015 --> 49:09.843
How far is it?

49:09.877 --> 49:11.258
- Few miles away.

49:11.293 --> 49:12.604
- Let's go then, Sergeant.

49:13.743 --> 49:15.780
Oh and by the way,
I do like men.

49:15.814 --> 49:17.402
Just haven't met a real one yet.

49:26.308 --> 49:27.895
? Wrap it up put it in

49:27.930 --> 49:29.794
? Never take it out

49:29.828 --> 49:31.727
? Wrap it up put it in

49:31.761 --> 49:33.729
? Never take it out

49:33.763 --> 49:35.800
? Wrap it up put it in

49:35.834 --> 49:37.595
? Never take it out

49:37.629 --> 49:39.631
? Your hands against my hips

49:39.666 --> 49:41.633
? My lips against your lips

49:41.668 --> 49:43.497
? You take me to a paradise

49:43.532 --> 49:45.499
? My waterfalls are bliss

49:45.534 --> 49:48.709
? And I can it rain all night

49:49.572 --> 49:50.815
? 'Cause tonight

49:50.849 --> 49:53.680
- What was that?
? No rules apply

49:53.714 --> 49:55.371
? I don't care who
you been with ?

49:55.406 --> 49:56.200
- Oh my God.

49:56.234 --> 49:57.995
- Carl, what's wrong?

50:07.418 --> 50:11.456
? So for the next three hours

50:12.388 --> 50:16.289
? Nothing else matters

50:16.323 --> 50:20.120
? We can make time stand still

50:20.155 --> 50:22.640
? Stand still

50:22.674 --> 50:25.436
? I wanna box this

50:25.470 --> 50:28.853
- You mustn't get Jack
too excited or worked up.

50:28.887 --> 50:30.441
Must they, Jack?

50:30.475 --> 50:32.167
- We just wanna pick
his brains a little bit.

50:32.201 --> 50:33.444
- Well, that should be easy.

50:33.478 --> 50:35.204
I haven't got much
brains left to pick.

50:37.448 --> 50:39.898
- Can you tell us about
these operational bases?

50:39.933 --> 50:41.624
- Yeah, OBs.

50:41.659 --> 50:44.524
In 1940, hundreds
of these places

50:44.558 --> 50:48.045
were built underground and
they remained operational

50:48.079 --> 50:51.013
until they were abandoned
when the Auxiliaries

50:51.048 --> 50:53.326
were stood down in 1944.

50:53.360 --> 50:56.708
Now, most of the people never
knew anything about 'em.

50:56.743 --> 50:58.538
And those who did know
something about 'em

50:58.572 --> 51:00.022
well, most of 'em are dead now.

51:00.057 --> 51:04.095
- What were they built for,
what were these Auxiliary units?

51:04.130 --> 51:06.960
- The OBs were our
last line of defense.

51:06.994 --> 51:08.789
- Ah, so we're
talking World War II.

51:08.824 --> 51:10.308
- Yep.

51:10.343 --> 51:13.484
After Dunkirk, remains of
our little army came back

51:13.518 --> 51:18.075
and uh, we knew that Hitler
was going to invade us any day.

51:19.386 --> 51:22.562
So Winston Churchill
decided that he would create

51:22.596 --> 51:26.048
a resistance group made
up of the most able

51:26.083 --> 51:29.086
and dedicated of the Home Guard.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.432
- Dad's Army.

51:30.466 --> 51:32.054
- That's right.

51:32.089 --> 51:34.712
- Old men and young
boys willing to fight

51:34.746 --> 51:38.267
the invading Germans with
pitchforks and blunderbusses.

51:38.302 --> 51:40.097
- It was like that
in the beginning.

51:41.546 --> 51:43.962
But the Auxiliaries were
something different.

51:43.997 --> 51:45.412
- And you were one
of the Auxiliaries.

51:45.447 --> 51:46.517
- Yes, I was.

51:47.759 --> 51:49.761
And we were so secret
that this is actually

51:49.796 --> 51:52.592
the very first time I've
ever talked about it

51:52.626 --> 51:53.834
in all that time.

51:53.869 --> 51:55.940
- I think Jack's
getting tired now.

51:55.974 --> 51:57.700
Maybe you could
come back tomorrow.

51:57.735 --> 51:59.150
- I'm sorry, this
is rather urgent.

51:59.185 --> 52:00.979
- No, no, no, it's all
right, love, it's all right.

52:01.014 --> 52:03.637
Now listen, I think you
better go make us a cup of tea

52:03.672 --> 52:06.399
because what I'm gonna say
here now might contravene

52:06.433 --> 52:07.952
the Official Secrets Act

52:07.986 --> 52:11.335
and I don't want to
get you into trouble.

52:11.369 --> 52:12.784
Well, not that way anyway.

52:21.310 --> 52:22.346
Now, where was I?

52:22.380 --> 52:23.692
Yes.

52:25.418 --> 52:28.938
Those of us who volunteered
and were selected

52:28.973 --> 52:31.009
were taught how to
kill the Germans

52:31.044 --> 52:32.942
in the most horrible ways.

52:32.977 --> 52:34.392
- So you were to fight on

52:34.427 --> 52:37.050
after the supposedly
imminent invasion.

52:37.084 --> 52:38.776
- To the last man.

52:38.810 --> 52:41.503
They gave us the best
weapons available.

52:41.537 --> 52:43.850
They gave us plenty
of explosive.

52:43.884 --> 52:48.303
They taught us how to
survive, how to improvise,

52:48.337 --> 52:50.822
and how to conduct
guerrilla warfare.

52:50.857 --> 52:53.722
- Using the underground
OBs as boltholes.

52:53.756 --> 52:54.585
- Yes.

52:55.551 --> 52:59.210
They gave us 14 days of rations

52:59.245 --> 53:02.386
'cause that was just about
as long as we were expected

53:02.420 --> 53:04.905
to survive after
the balloon went up.

53:04.940 --> 53:06.873
- I'm sorry, balloon went up?

53:06.907 --> 53:08.737
- After the Germans invaded.

53:08.771 --> 53:11.843
- Except the RAF defeated
the Germans in the air

53:11.878 --> 53:14.191
and without air cover,
the Nazis would never

53:14.225 --> 53:16.123
adventure across the
Channel from France.

53:16.158 --> 53:18.367
- You're right, the
Battle of Britain.

53:19.817 --> 53:22.820
Course all this must sound
like ancient history to you.

53:22.854 --> 53:25.892
- Thanks, Jack, this
has been very helpful.

53:25.926 --> 53:28.895
- No, now wait, there's
something else you gotta learn.

53:28.929 --> 53:30.586
- Don't upset yourself, Jack.

53:30.621 --> 53:31.829
You told us a lot.

53:31.863 --> 53:33.969
- The first task
of the Auxiliaries

53:34.003 --> 53:37.283
was to eliminant anyone
who knew anything about us,

53:37.317 --> 53:41.183
local policemen, town
mayor, local dignitaries.

53:41.218 --> 53:42.978
- You mean murder
your own people.

53:43.012 --> 53:44.462
- Yes.

53:44.497 --> 53:49.364
Anyone who might have any
knowledge of our whereabouts

53:50.503 --> 53:52.367
and who could give
it away under torture

53:52.401 --> 53:56.233
or interrogation was
to be eliminated.

53:56.267 --> 53:57.682
Something went wrong.

53:57.717 --> 53:59.443
There was an accident.

53:59.477 --> 54:02.100
It's one of those things
that happen in war.

54:02.135 --> 54:05.103
The signal for the invasion
was to be the ringing

54:05.138 --> 54:06.277
of the church bells.

54:06.312 --> 54:08.383
They'd been silent
since Dunkirk.

54:08.417 --> 54:12.904
I was walking home and the
bells of the local church rang

54:12.939 --> 54:14.803
and I was the only
person on duty.

54:14.837 --> 54:18.255
So I went straight to the OB.

54:18.289 --> 54:20.671
There was no one there
expect Bob Pearce.

54:20.705 --> 54:22.880
Now, Bob Pearce was
our commanding officer.

54:22.914 --> 54:25.054
He'd helped to set
the whole thing up.

54:25.089 --> 54:28.817
I mean, he knew the whereabouts
of every bunker in the area.

54:28.851 --> 54:33.028
So we opened our secret orders
and the first on the list

54:33.062 --> 54:38.067
of the people to be
killed was Bob Pearce.

54:40.415 --> 54:41.657
I shot him in the bunker.

54:44.004 --> 54:46.731
And then I climbed up to
do the rest on the list.

54:48.181 --> 54:49.389
And it was only when I got
outside that I realized

54:49.424 --> 54:51.978
that I couldn't hear the
bells ringing anymore.

54:54.118 --> 54:55.671
There had been no invasion.

54:56.845 --> 54:58.467
It was just a couple of kids

54:58.502 --> 55:01.643
who broke into the bloody
church to ring the bells

55:01.677 --> 55:02.644
for a lark.

55:04.370 --> 55:08.028
- It was an accident
of war a long time ago.

55:12.170 --> 55:16.209
- I went back down into the
OB, I smashed the radio,

55:16.243 --> 55:19.730
I sealed the hatch, and
as the months passed,

55:19.764 --> 55:21.835
chances of invasion diminished,

55:21.870 --> 55:23.389
and then we were all called up.

55:24.804 --> 55:27.185
- What relevance do you
think this has to our case?

55:28.773 --> 55:32.363
- I think Bob Pearce has
come back to kill Nazis.

55:32.398 --> 55:34.676
No, no, no, I know
it sounds ridiculous,

55:34.710 --> 55:36.229
but please listen to me.

55:36.263 --> 55:40.198
Bob swore to me once
that no matter what,

55:40.233 --> 55:44.513
even if he was killed, he
would find a way to come back

55:44.548 --> 55:45.894
and kill Germans.

55:46.929 --> 55:49.794
- So why kill police officers?

55:49.829 --> 55:51.313
- Oh, that's, that's easy.

55:51.348 --> 55:53.557
I mean, you think about the
police officers in those days.

55:53.591 --> 55:55.800
All they had were
those tall helmets.

55:55.835 --> 55:59.114
They were armed with
a watch, a whistle,

55:59.148 --> 56:00.564
and a truncheon.

56:00.598 --> 56:02.669
Now, these days you're
all wearing stab jackets,

56:02.704 --> 56:04.706
you're carrying
automatic weapons,

56:04.740 --> 56:06.535
and you're all dressed in black.

56:06.570 --> 56:09.711
Have you ever seen
pictures of the Waffen-SS?

56:09.745 --> 56:13.887
- Okay, so why now after
what must be 75 years?

56:13.922 --> 56:18.444
- I think somebody found
and opened the hatch.

56:21.205 --> 56:23.034
- It's gonna be okay, Jack.

56:23.069 --> 56:25.761
We know what we're looking
for now in the forest.

56:25.796 --> 56:26.624
Thank you.

56:28.419 --> 56:30.248
- I, if you're going after Bob,

56:30.283 --> 56:32.216
you'll take me with
you, won't you?

56:32.250 --> 56:34.805
- I'm not sure that's
gonna be possible.

56:34.839 --> 56:36.323
- You'll never find it.

56:36.358 --> 56:40.189
That place was designed to
be concealed from the enemy.

56:40.224 --> 56:42.847
I can take you
exactly to the place.

56:42.882 --> 56:44.124
- Thank you, Jack.

56:44.159 --> 56:45.850
We'll let you know
if we need you.

56:47.127 --> 56:48.128
- All right.

56:49.336 --> 56:50.130
Thank you.

56:55.032 --> 56:56.827
- Well, if we tell any of
this to anyone on the force,

56:56.861 --> 56:59.243
they'll think we've
lost our marbles.

56:59.277 --> 57:00.071
- Maybe not.

57:00.106 --> 57:01.314
- How so?

57:01.348 --> 57:03.489
- Well, from what
the old boy told us,

57:03.523 --> 57:05.145
maybe we should be
looking for a nut

57:05.180 --> 57:08.010
who is using this
OB underground base.

57:11.531 --> 57:12.394
- DI Huntley.

57:18.435 --> 57:20.747
There's been another murder.

57:34.071 --> 57:36.487
- How lovely of you to join us.

57:36.522 --> 57:38.524
I should fill you in on
what's happening, shall I?

57:38.558 --> 57:41.009
- I'd rather hear it from
forensics, thank you.

57:42.459 --> 57:44.702
- A fairly straightforward
crime, Detective Inspector.

57:44.737 --> 57:47.394
A young man in the front of
a car with his throat cut

57:47.429 --> 57:48.913
and, again, probably
died instantly.

57:48.948 --> 57:51.502
- And the shoe, tell
them about the shoe.

57:51.537 --> 57:52.676
- I will get to that.

57:52.710 --> 57:54.263
Please don't try
and tell me my job.

57:58.129 --> 57:59.579
- Shoe?

57:59.614 --> 58:00.994
- Well, we're convinced
there was another occupant

58:01.029 --> 58:02.271
in the car,

58:02.306 --> 58:03.859
most probably a woman
as we found a handbag

58:03.894 --> 58:07.311
in the passenger side foot
well and a discarded shoe.

58:07.345 --> 58:09.934
- I'll send a couple of
officers over to scour the woods

58:09.969 --> 58:11.936
to see if they can
find another dead body.

58:11.971 --> 58:14.007
- Or missing person.

58:14.042 --> 58:15.664
- Do we have identities?

58:15.699 --> 58:17.701
- Well, we've got the man's
details from the contents

58:17.735 --> 58:19.081
of his pocket.

58:19.116 --> 58:20.600
We haven't as yet
opened the handbag

58:20.635 --> 58:22.602
as we're checking the blood
spattered on the side of it,

58:22.637 --> 58:24.121
most probably from
the murder vic.

58:24.155 --> 58:26.261
- Could the missing woman
have carried out the murder?

58:26.295 --> 58:30.092
- Theoretically possible
except for two factors.

58:31.266 --> 58:32.785
You see the victim was
undoubtedly attacked

58:32.819 --> 58:35.063
from above and behind.

58:35.097 --> 58:36.789
If you take a look at
the roof of the vehicle,

58:36.823 --> 58:38.549
somebody, and quite
possibly the murderer,

58:38.584 --> 58:41.863
has gained access from
outside after ripping a hole

58:41.897 --> 58:42.829
in the canvas hood.

58:47.109 --> 58:49.284
- That's a German car.

58:49.318 --> 58:53.115
- Uh, does that have any bearing
whatsoever on this matter?

58:53.150 --> 58:53.978
- It might do.

58:56.567 --> 58:58.396
- Huntley, I've communicated

58:58.431 --> 59:00.053
to the Assistant
Chief Commissioner

59:00.088 --> 59:02.193
and she has agreed
with me that it's time

59:02.228 --> 59:04.023
to bring in the army
so that we can do

59:04.057 --> 59:06.059
a thorough search of this forest

59:06.094 --> 59:08.993
so that we can catch
this sicko, okay?

59:10.650 --> 59:11.755
Good.

59:11.789 --> 59:12.618
Carry on.

59:15.344 --> 59:17.864
- Looks like it's time for
some more drastic measures.

59:23.905 --> 59:25.320
- I'm not being funny now.

59:25.354 --> 59:26.908
But we're not gonna scale
up the operation now

59:26.942 --> 59:29.324
for one lunatic
hiding in the forest.

59:29.358 --> 59:31.222
- I got up early this
morning because I thought

59:31.257 --> 59:33.915
there was gonna be at least
double this amount of men.

59:33.949 --> 59:35.502
What is this?

59:35.537 --> 59:38.575
- All right.

59:40.335 --> 59:42.095
Assistant Chief
Commissioner Dale

59:42.130 --> 59:43.925
was expecting more men, sir.

59:43.959 --> 59:46.617
- I'm sorry I don't have the
manpower to spare more troops

59:46.652 --> 59:48.826
for an operation of this nature.

59:48.861 --> 59:51.104
And Grant here is a
very experienced officer

59:51.139 --> 59:52.416
at rooting out terrorist.

59:52.450 --> 59:54.970
All our men have been
operationally trained

59:55.005 --> 59:56.731
for this type of mission.

59:57.904 --> 59:58.733
- Sir.

01:01:46.185 --> 01:01:48.739
- All right, boys, we're
going into Shafton Forest.

01:01:48.774 --> 01:01:50.568
Obviously the ground
that we're dealing with

01:01:50.603 --> 01:01:52.847
is thick and uneven woodland.

01:01:52.881 --> 01:01:54.780
Advance with caution.

01:01:54.814 --> 01:01:56.195
Situation enemy forces,

01:01:56.229 --> 01:01:59.267
we're dealing with
one lone insurgent.

01:01:59.301 --> 01:02:00.924
He's responsible for
a lot of casualties

01:02:00.958 --> 01:02:02.719
so he seems like he's
gonna be trained.

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:04.444
Situation friendly forces,

01:02:04.479 --> 01:02:06.826
we're gonna be joined by our
friends in the police force.

01:02:06.861 --> 01:02:08.759
Hopefully they won't
get in the way.

01:02:08.794 --> 01:02:12.763
Our mission, find, apprehend,
or neutralize the insurgent.

01:02:12.798 --> 01:02:13.626
All right, boys?

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:14.454
- Sir.

01:02:14.489 --> 01:02:15.352
- Happy?

01:02:15.386 --> 01:02:16.146
- Sir.
- Let's go.

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:35.096
- What on Earth?

01:02:37.477 --> 01:02:39.894
What exactly are you playing
at, Detective Inspector,

01:02:39.928 --> 01:02:42.034
bringing this elderly
gentleman here?

01:02:42.068 --> 01:02:43.276
- This is Jack.

01:02:43.311 --> 01:02:45.209
He's a member of
the Auxiliary Group.

01:02:45.244 --> 01:02:46.935
He worked from an
underground base here

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:48.523
back in 1940.

01:02:48.557 --> 01:02:49.938
He's gonna show us
where that base is

01:02:49.973 --> 01:02:51.181
and who's hiding there.

01:02:51.215 --> 01:02:53.183
- All right, look,
this is ridiculous.

01:02:53.217 --> 01:02:54.356
What makes you think
someone's gonna use

01:02:54.391 --> 01:02:56.220
a redundant old wartime base?

01:02:56.255 --> 01:02:58.913
What are the chances this guy
can remember that far back?

01:02:58.947 --> 01:03:01.018
Forest doesn't
even look the same.

01:03:02.019 --> 01:03:03.400
- How long were you based here?

01:03:03.434 --> 01:03:06.437
- Few months now,
but I remember it

01:03:06.472 --> 01:03:08.508
like it was yesterday.

01:03:08.543 --> 01:03:09.786
- So why were you here?

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.374
- When the German Army
swept over this area,

01:03:13.479 --> 01:03:17.552
our job was to
kill, delay, harass

01:03:18.622 --> 01:03:20.037
with all possible means.

01:03:20.072 --> 01:03:23.316
Our second function
was to use our radios

01:03:23.351 --> 01:03:25.491
to inform what was left
of the British Army

01:03:25.525 --> 01:03:26.906
of the situation.

01:03:28.563 --> 01:03:30.358
- Can you give me information
about what somebody

01:03:30.392 --> 01:03:32.118
trying to emulate
your resistance group

01:03:32.153 --> 01:03:35.501
might have done that we
haven't released to the media?

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:39.160
- Yes, ma'am, I think I can.

01:03:40.368 --> 01:03:45.097
It would surprise me if
you have not come across

01:03:45.891 --> 01:03:47.478
some disemboweled bodies

01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:52.311
with their entrails
decoratively spread.

01:03:52.345 --> 01:03:54.520
- What was the point of that?

01:03:54.554 --> 01:03:56.591
- To intimidate the enemy.

01:03:56.625 --> 01:04:00.250
There's nothing quite like
seeing your mate's guts

01:04:00.284 --> 01:04:03.149
spread out like a
plate of spaghetti

01:04:03.184 --> 01:04:06.118
for making you pause to think.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:08.983
- Anything's worth a try.

01:04:10.225 --> 01:04:11.399
- Thank you, ma'am.

01:04:18.337 --> 01:04:19.752
- You fit to talk?

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:22.997
- But you're not
gonna believe me.

01:04:23.031 --> 01:04:24.688
The military police
spoke to me just now

01:04:24.722 --> 01:04:26.069
and they think I
knocked my brains out.

01:04:26.103 --> 01:04:27.449
- That's okay.

01:04:27.484 --> 01:04:29.589
Most of our colleagues
feel the same about us

01:04:29.624 --> 01:04:31.488
and we haven't been
hit on the head.

01:04:31.522 --> 01:04:33.317
- Or choked half to death.

01:04:33.352 --> 01:04:35.595
But I know what I saw
and I know what I felt

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:38.771
and that thing
was cold and dead.

01:04:38.805 --> 01:04:40.807
- Well, this is our friend Jack.

01:04:40.842 --> 01:04:42.637
He thinks he has some answers.

01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:44.915
He wants to ask you a
few simple questions.

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:46.296
- Okay.

01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:47.228
- Hello, darling.

01:04:48.401 --> 01:04:50.507
Now, this thing you
saw, was it wearing

01:04:50.541 --> 01:04:52.371
a military uniform?

01:04:52.405 --> 01:04:54.856
- Wasn't paying much attention
to what it was wearing.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.340
Even thinking about
it makes me shudder

01:04:56.375 --> 01:04:58.032
and it happened so fast.

01:04:59.516 --> 01:05:02.933
But uh, maybe it did have
or at least some remnants

01:05:02.968 --> 01:05:07.627
of Cargi, but it was decayed
and like a body dug up

01:05:07.662 --> 01:05:10.078
and its eyes were just--

01:05:10.113 --> 01:05:12.115
- Why do you think it
stopped attacking you,

01:05:12.149 --> 01:05:13.495
let you go?

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:15.221
- If this lump on my
head is letting me go,

01:05:15.256 --> 01:05:16.809
then I don't know what you mean.

01:05:16.843 --> 01:05:20.951
But it did look at me and
seemed surprised, curious,

01:05:20.986 --> 01:05:22.953
as if I was from another planet.

01:05:22.988 --> 01:05:25.197
It started to study my uniform.

01:05:25.231 --> 01:05:27.406
Uh, it was disgusting.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.787
It smelled putrid.

01:05:29.822 --> 01:05:32.031
- It's confused
because she's black.

01:05:32.066 --> 01:05:33.481
- Excuse me.

01:05:33.515 --> 01:05:35.483
- Oh, no, no, no, no
offense intended, darling.

01:05:35.517 --> 01:05:39.763
Now, I'm sorry, but look at it

01:05:39.797 --> 01:05:42.179
from his perspective, all right.

01:05:42.214 --> 01:05:47.150
I mean, he knows that the Nazis
are the most racist people

01:05:47.184 --> 01:05:48.323
on the planet.

01:05:48.358 --> 01:05:50.843
You are clearly of
Afro-Caribbean descent.

01:05:52.189 --> 01:05:55.641
There is no way that
they would've allowed her

01:05:55.675 --> 01:05:56.676
in their army.

01:05:57.850 --> 01:05:59.058
He's confused.

01:05:59.093 --> 01:06:01.681
- Okay, this is all
getting very weird.

01:06:12.623 --> 01:06:14.798
- Stormtroopers here, too.

01:06:51.076 --> 01:06:53.733
Here, tell that officer
up ahead to slow down

01:06:53.768 --> 01:06:55.011
and keep his eyes peeled.

01:06:56.598 --> 01:06:58.531
- All right, we've
thrown a police cordon

01:06:58.566 --> 01:07:00.326
round the entire forest.

01:07:00.361 --> 01:07:02.018
Now nothing can get out.

01:07:02.052 --> 01:07:03.985
We'll have the murdering
bastard this time.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.435
- Listen, before
you do anything,

01:07:05.469 --> 01:07:07.989
let me talk to Bob
because I don't think

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:10.785
you're gonna be able to
stop him by physical means.

01:07:10.819 --> 01:07:13.822
- Do you really give any credence
to this old man's fantasy?

01:07:13.857 --> 01:07:16.998
Because I think your career's
pretty much blown if you do.

01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:22.038
- Jack, do you really
believe that this Bob Pearce

01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:24.661
is carrying out these murders
from beyond the grave?

01:07:25.662 --> 01:07:29.148
- Yes, ma'am, I do believe that.

01:07:29.183 --> 01:07:31.530
Bob Pearce was a patriot.

01:07:31.564 --> 01:07:34.947
He died for his country
and I believe he thinks

01:07:34.981 --> 01:07:38.295
that the Germans have
landed and are invading.

01:07:39.779 --> 01:07:42.610
And if I am right, you're
gonna find a few surprises

01:07:42.644 --> 01:07:44.129
that he's set for us up ahead.

01:07:44.163 --> 01:07:47.753
- This man has confessed to
murdering his superior officer.

01:07:47.787 --> 01:07:50.273
Shouldn't you be talking to
the CPS about a prosecution

01:07:50.307 --> 01:07:52.516
instead of indulging
him in this stupidity?

01:07:54.553 --> 01:07:56.037
- Excuse me.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:57.728
- With me, boys.

01:08:05.011 --> 01:08:06.392
This way.

01:08:07.428 --> 01:08:08.222
It's not far.

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.229
- All
right, take it slow.

01:08:15.263 --> 01:08:17.541
- Boys, keep left.

01:08:25.515 --> 01:08:26.343
Hold back.

01:08:35.352 --> 01:08:36.353
- Mother me.

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:43.497
- She's alive!

01:08:43.533 --> 01:08:44.361
Get back!

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:46.122
- Why?

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:54.060
- God, no, get me down!

01:08:55.613 --> 01:08:56.993
Get me down!

01:08:58.305 --> 01:08:59.203
- Booby trap.

01:08:59.238 --> 01:09:00.100
Get down!

01:09:04.036 --> 01:09:05.761
- Grenades, take cover.

01:09:05.796 --> 01:09:06.625
- Oh, God!

01:09:07.867 --> 01:09:08.696
No, no!

01:09:14.978 --> 01:09:18.154
Get me down.

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:20.673
- I don't know much about it,

01:09:20.707 --> 01:09:22.537
but I don't think you can
delay a grenade that long

01:09:22.572 --> 01:09:23.537
before it explodes.

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:27.059
- All right, everyone
stay where you are.

01:09:31.374 --> 01:09:33.134
- Get me down!

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.032
- They might be ancient and
obviously pretty much dud

01:09:35.067 --> 01:09:37.033
but they're still
dangerously volatile.

01:09:39.554 --> 01:09:40.761
Someone help this lady.

01:09:40.796 --> 01:09:42.212
- Oh, fuck
her, get me down!

01:09:42.247 --> 01:09:44.145
- Go and get the bomb
disposal team and medics.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.180
- Chief, ah!

01:09:46.147 --> 01:09:47.631
- And take your time.

01:09:47.666 --> 01:09:50.393
God knows what other booby
traps are in these woods.

01:09:50.426 --> 01:09:52.326
- Ah, oh yeah.

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:54.742
Oh, oh.

01:09:54.776 --> 01:09:56.226
- I don't think they're
gonna get anything

01:09:56.261 --> 01:09:58.849
out of her for a
couple of hours.

01:09:58.884 --> 01:09:59.712
Poor kid.

01:10:05.684 --> 01:10:06.857
- Shouldn't we wait
for the others, sir?

01:10:06.892 --> 01:10:08.134
- No, waste of time.

01:10:08.169 --> 01:10:10.482
This is the area we
should be searching.

01:10:10.516 --> 01:10:13.243
Clear evidence somebody's
been living here.

01:10:16.419 --> 01:10:19.249
Quiet, quiet!

01:10:19.284 --> 01:10:22.045
And whoever it is
is still around.

01:10:22.079 --> 01:10:23.978
You should've been
more vigilant.

01:10:24.012 --> 01:10:26.774
You two, take this idiot
back to the field hospital,

01:10:26.808 --> 01:10:29.397
get me another one, get back
here as soon as possible.

01:10:29.432 --> 01:10:30.605
You two with me.

01:10:48.382 --> 01:10:49.417
- Oh!

01:11:05.951 --> 01:11:07.332
- Tell 'em to stop.

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:10.231
- What's wrong?

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.094
- We're here.

01:11:12.751 --> 01:11:13.924
- Captain.

01:11:13.959 --> 01:11:14.787
Halt your men.

01:11:19.378 --> 01:11:20.621
- What's the problem?

01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:24.314
- You see that
rotting trunk there?

01:11:24.349 --> 01:11:25.142
- Yeah.

01:11:25.177 --> 01:11:26.696
- That is a chimney.

01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:30.286
Now, if I remember correctly,
just over behind those bushes

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.046
was the escape hatch.

01:11:33.461 --> 01:11:34.290
- Escape hatch.

01:11:36.844 --> 01:11:39.018
Meadows, go and check
out that escape hatch.

01:11:41.158 --> 01:11:44.921
- Yeah, this is the place.

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:49.408
- What do you mean
this is the place?

01:11:49.443 --> 01:11:50.789
Jack, there's nothing here.

01:11:52.825 --> 01:11:54.413
- You're standing on top of it.

01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:04.837
- Yeah,
there's something here.

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:09.359
- Captain, I found
it but the ground slipped

01:12:09.394 --> 01:12:10.636
and covered everything up.

01:12:10.671 --> 01:12:11.913
This is the only way out.

01:12:14.122 --> 01:12:16.262
- All right,
how do we open it?

01:12:16.297 --> 01:12:17.574
- Oh right then.

01:12:19.404 --> 01:12:23.580
Only thing I ever nicked
from the army was this.

01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:26.272
Now, now.

01:12:28.654 --> 01:12:31.243
Now, as I remember,
the catch ,

01:12:33.383 --> 01:12:34.557
the catch was over this way.

01:12:39.596 --> 01:12:41.080
Ah, there you are.

01:12:48.881 --> 01:12:50.020
Come on now, Bob.

01:12:50.055 --> 01:12:51.677
There are no Germans here.

01:12:51.712 --> 01:12:53.369
They're all British.

01:12:53.403 --> 01:12:55.578
There was no invasion.

01:12:55.612 --> 01:12:58.615
Those bells, ah,
they were a mistake.

01:13:00.997 --> 01:13:04.103
The RAF beat the
Germans in the sky

01:13:04.138 --> 01:13:06.382
and then Hitler bought London.

01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:08.314
He went and invaded
Russia instead.

01:13:08.349 --> 01:13:12.698
And then all, all the decent
people in the bloody world

01:13:12.733 --> 01:13:14.528
come to our side.

01:13:14.562 --> 01:13:16.806
The Empire, the
Commonwealth, the Dominions,

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.808
even the Yanks got in.

01:13:18.842 --> 01:13:21.293
Late as usual, but by God.

01:13:22.467 --> 01:13:23.329
Anyway,

01:13:26.505 --> 01:13:28.576
Bob, the only thing
that remains now

01:13:30.233 --> 01:13:33.995
is something between you
and me and let's do this

01:13:35.169 --> 01:13:38.448
man to man, face to
face, the way we would

01:13:38.483 --> 01:13:39.622
back in 1940.

01:13:42.107 --> 01:13:44.350
Come on out now,
old friend, please.

01:13:46.214 --> 01:13:47.008
Come on out.

01:14:13.207 --> 01:14:14.346
- Go!

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.728
- No, it's all right,
it's all right.

01:14:16.762 --> 01:14:17.591
It's Bob.

01:14:19.351 --> 01:14:20.179
It's Bob.

01:14:27.601 --> 01:14:29.948
Bob, I'm... I want you to know

01:14:31.984 --> 01:14:33.434
how sorry I am.

01:14:34.849 --> 01:14:37.680
Those bells, it
wasn't the invasion.

01:14:39.129 --> 01:14:42.201
It was a couple of kids
that broke into the church

01:14:42.236 --> 01:14:43.271
for a lark.

01:14:44.583 --> 01:14:48.173
And then you, you saw the orders

01:14:49.277 --> 01:14:50.313
for me to kill you

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.660
and the others.

01:14:57.872 --> 01:14:58.770
Bob.

01:14:58.804 --> 01:15:03.775
I'm, I'm, I'm so sorry, mate.

01:15:04.534 --> 01:15:06.191
I'm truly sorry.

01:15:07.261 --> 01:15:09.090
I beg you, forgive me.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.034
- You all right?

01:15:56.068 --> 01:15:56.897
Jack.

01:15:57.898 --> 01:15:58.692
Just breathe.

01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:05.353
- All right, what's up?

01:16:05.388 --> 01:16:06.562
You okay, sir?

01:16:21.266 --> 01:16:24.580
We need you back to a safe distance, so we can get down there and sort this out.

01:16:24.614 --> 01:16:27.341
According to records, there's enough unstable TNT down there

01:16:27.375 --> 01:16:29.343
to blow up the whole of Shafton Forest.

01:16:53.988 --> 01:16:59.500
I don't know how the hell, you're gonna write this one up, gov.
