You can't come to Atlantic City
and not gamble once.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.237
I can because I didn't come to gamble.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.531
I came here to see Cirque du Soleil,
which you love.

00:31.531 --> 00:35.118
The trampoline lady was fun,
the rest was kind of creepy.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.578
Here. Come on. Come here.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.247
One bet. Just for fun.
So you can say you gambled.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.331
Where'd you get this?

00:40.331 --> 00:42.125
- Throw it right there.
- Yeah.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.460
- One bet.
- Yeah.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.003
- Here? Okay.
Okay? Yeah.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.838
Yeah?
- Good, go. Come on.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.131
Come on. Okay.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.257
Okay, okay, okay.

00:50.049 --> 00:51.509
Oh, no.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.471
- Baby, you lost.
- It's fun.

00:54.471 --> 00:57.098
- No, have this one.
- You wanna know what else is fun?

00:57.098 --> 00:58.016
What?

00:58.016 --> 01:00.518
Why don't you come to the room
and let me show you?

01:00.518 --> 01:01.895
Mm.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.230
Okay.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.983

- Yeah.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.506
On it.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.373
I got a text. Clock starts now.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.667
We should have
the truck hooked up in a minute,

02:05.667 --> 02:08.294
then on my signal you can yank her up.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.922
Let me know. You got an hour.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.173
Should be plenty.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.635
Might even be enough time left over
to pull up that Porsche.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.888
It's pronounced "Porsche."

02:19.764 --> 02:23.268
- A lot of Americans say it wrong.
I've always wanted one.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.437
As soon as we have that gold,
I might buy myself one.

02:30.358 --> 02:31.192
Gold.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.152
What?

02:35.697 --> 02:37.365
That's what's in this truck?

02:37.365 --> 02:38.783
- Gold?
- No.

02:39.868 --> 02:40.994
Just talking shit.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.495
I do that.

02:45.081 --> 02:49.460
Suddenly, my thousand bucks
doesn't seem like so much.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.302
What are you doing?

02:59.345 --> 03:03.725
Um, this is fine. Yeah, I don't care.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.643
He keeps running away.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.022
Yeah, like I said, it's whatever. I--

03:09.022 --> 03:10.148
He has dementia.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.609
So people say I should put him somewhere

03:12.609 --> 03:15.320
but I can't do that
because he's my dad, so--

03:16.195 --> 03:19.532
So I have to bring him to work with me,
but he runs off,

03:19.532 --> 03:21.534
and he doesn't know where he is.

03:22.076 --> 03:26.205
And at least this way,
I get to spend time with him, you know?

03:26.205 --> 03:27.290
Which is nice.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.834

- Oh, yeah.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.424
Right after we discuss my deal.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.467
I said get in.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.722
You don't scare me.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.684
Just get your fucking boss
up here to talk a deal.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.938
Before I call the pol--

03:52.357 --> 03:53.608
That sound like a gunshot?

04:04.619 --> 04:05.954
Damn it, Buzz.

04:06.913 --> 04:07.956
No.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.545
Sorry, where's the bathroom?

04:15.588 --> 04:19.509
Yeah, ladies' is busted
but men's is that way.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.804
Sorry, chief. He was gonna call the cops.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.222
- It's okay.
- It's okay?

04:24.222 --> 04:25.556
- It's okay.
It's not.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.600
I wanted new alligator boots
and an airboat.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.602
Now I'm never getting
boots and an airboat.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.896
- Would you shut up?
- Hey, hey, hey.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.482
You were in a hurry.
You wanted to be in charge.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.277
You wouldn't listen to me and here we are.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.529
- Crane operator?
- Yeah. Used to be.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.364
Well, that's a problem.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.783
- None of us can operate a crane.
- Not the problem.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.285
It's a problem.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.704
A man is dead.
That's what we need to deal with.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.372
At least the body's gone.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.086

05:07.974 --> 05:09.142
There's no place.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.353
Too far. I don't want you
driving around with a dead body.

05:12.353 --> 05:15.982
I can dive down and put the body
in the trunk of the Porsche.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.358
- What?
- That's how it's said.

05:17.358 --> 05:20.611
It's a good idea.
They pour concrete over it in a few days.

05:20.611 --> 05:23.948
I hate to give up the car,
but I feel a little responsible.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.241
A little?

05:25.241 --> 05:27.285

and do the thing.

What? You have a guy and a thing.
But you don't have a place?

05:30.330 --> 05:33.833

I'll go get stuff to clean this up.

- It's my trouble, I'll take care of it--
- You'll use my things?

08:23.461 --> 08:26.547
You'll leave something on them

11:54.213 --> 11:57.800

Okay, that is the actual definition
of "arrangement," but okay.

12:27.788 --> 12:30.875

when he hired me.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.918

12:33.502 --> 12:36.130
and he never put me in this spot,
not ever.

12:36.130 --> 12:39.008
He acted like I was a son. Almost.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.970
Now here he is talking to me
like some asshole cop.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.097
He's only thinking about himself.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.475

14:25.114 --> 14:28.409
Cops won't be looking for him
for 48 hours, which is tomorrow night,

14:28.409 --> 14:31.287
which is why we need
to be out of there tonight.

14:32.121 --> 14:32.955

14:36.041 --> 14:36.959

- Airbags?
- Like salvage divers use.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.174
We drag it to the church,

14:44.174 --> 14:46.927
which is now unguarded
thanks to your girlfriend.

14:46.927 --> 14:50.514
We offload it,
we take it back, re-sink it.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.517
That sound like a plan?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.896
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Outside of that.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.606
Yeah, good.

14:59.773 --> 15:02.651
There are floats on Gil's boat.
Give me Ray-Ray and his truck.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.362
- We'll take it to the church.
- Whose boat?

15:05.362 --> 15:07.948
Gil Franco.
The first guy who died for this gold.

15:07.948 --> 15:11.827
If you think Gil Franco
was the first who died for this gold,

15:11.827 --> 15:14.246
Miss Larson didn't teach you
too much history.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.249
There you are.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.252
I had the best day
at the flea market yesterday.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.631
That lady with the paintings
had this sitting there.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.758
Yeah, I bet she was a movie star.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.395
- Hey.
Hey.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.813
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

15:39.813 --> 15:42.441
- Where'd you go?
- To see my dad.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.609
Make a new plan.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.487
You didn't think I should be there?

15:46.487 --> 15:47.947
Well, you were asleep.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.240
Yeah, but I do this thing
where I also wake up.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.911
You were there in spirit, believe me.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.038
He'd cut me out in two seconds.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.374
Don't remind him
how much he doesn't need me.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.376
He doesn't need me either, so...

16:00.376 --> 16:02.544
- Yeah, but he wants you.
- What?

16:02.544 --> 16:05.339
He likes doing this with you. I can tell.

16:08.592 --> 16:11.053
I'd like it better myself
if we'd stop killing people.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.513
Yeah.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.140
That part wasn't great.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.725
No, it wasn't.

16:18.268 --> 16:19.603
A man died, Delly.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.439
A person died for what we wanted.

16:22.439 --> 16:25.317
Actually, he died for what he wanted.
But, yeah.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.699
Just one more day
and we're out of here, okay?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.036
One more day.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.763
Place your bets.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.391
Nine!

17:06.191 --> 17:07.276
Get your bets in.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.487
- All right, bets in.
- Mike. Mike.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.364
What are you doing out of bed?

17:12.364 --> 17:14.199
What am I--? It's 3:00 in the morning.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.576
- What are you doing?
- I'm up.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.203
- I can see that.
- I'm "up" up, like ahead.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.997
Why don't you come back to the room?

17:19.997 --> 17:22.249
- Be right up. I promise.
Seven out.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.959
Fuck. Okay. It's okay.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.046
Mike, this was supposed to be
us getting away to have a good time.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.630
- We are.
- One of us isn't.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.049
A few more minutes.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.425
I don't wanna be this person

17:31.425 --> 17:33.886
who has to come down
and drag you out of a casino.

17:33.886 --> 17:34.928
Then don't be.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.308
Okay? Just one more bet. I told you.

17:45.689 --> 17:48.067
Welcome to the Palm's, my friend.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.902
- Checking in?
- No, no.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.987
I'm looking for a friend.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.782
Mike Valentine.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.700
Yes. Room two.

17:56.700 --> 17:59.286
- Would you like me to--? Yeah?
- Gone.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.332
- He checked out.
When did he check out?

18:03.332 --> 18:05.459
While you were at the store.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.796
Yes. Yes.

18:08.796 --> 18:12.466
I forgot you told me that.
He has checked out.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.550
He's gone.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.346
Say where he was going?

18:18.639 --> 18:20.182
- No.
- No?

18:20.182 --> 18:21.100
No.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.443
Okay.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.238
Thank you.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.744
Why are we lying?

18:40.744 --> 18:45.666
Because a friend of Mike Valentine
is not a friend of ours.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.965
Hi!

18:52.965 --> 18:54.299
Iris!

18:54.299 --> 18:57.302
I brought you the chocolates you like
from Philly.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.599
Patsy, why is Mike down here?

19:02.599 --> 19:03.851
Work. You?

19:03.851 --> 19:06.311
Same. He mention what kind?

19:07.729 --> 19:10.524
No. What kind is it you're doing?

19:11.567 --> 19:14.570
I'm investigating some trouble in Philly.

19:14.570 --> 19:19.032
Worried Mike might have
brought it down here or followed it.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.578
Tell me the truth. Is he in danger?

19:22.578 --> 19:23.871
I don't know yet.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.790
But these people he's working for...

19:27.499 --> 19:30.711
My murder victim was found
chopped up with a power saw.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.255
Wounds were not post-mortem.
You know what that means?

19:33.255 --> 19:34.715
Yeah, they sawed him up alive.

19:34.715 --> 19:39.344
Yeah, so I'm asking if you can tell me
where I can find Mike...

19:40.179 --> 19:41.513
before he gets hurt.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.769
He doesn't know you're in Florida.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.107
Well, I wanted to talk to you first.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.943
As someone who cares about him,
or as a cop?

19:54.943 --> 19:58.405
As both, Patsy, I can be both.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.452
Well, I can't.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.414
Patsy, come on.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.000
It was really nice to see you, Iris.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.084
I mean it.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.587
And thank you so much for the chocolates.

20:20.886 --> 20:21.720
Hey.

20:22.512 --> 20:23.388
Excuse me.

20:23.972 --> 20:26.892
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for a friend.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.728
Oh, a friend.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.688
Mike Valentine.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.525
No, sorry.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.862
I guess I should've asked up front.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.698
Okay. I hope you find your friend.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.912
I use your bathroom?

20:47.913 --> 20:48.789
What?

20:50.082 --> 20:52.334
It's an old guy thing, prostate,

20:52.334 --> 20:57.839
like the ads with the guy who has to miss
his grandkid's school play to go pee.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.925
Those ads are really dead on.

21:02.094 --> 21:02.928
Yeah, okay.

21:02.928 --> 21:03.887
- Ah.
- Sure.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.217
You're a lifesaver.

21:43.093 --> 21:47.472
Tell your husband, "Don't get old."

21:48.056 --> 21:48.974
Sorry?

21:49.850 --> 21:52.185
Uh, I saw his shaving stuff.

21:52.185 --> 21:53.729
I assumed.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.440
But you're not wearing a ring, so...

21:58.066 --> 22:00.485
Oh, yeah, I take it off to go swimming.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.531
Oh. Great idea.

22:08.952 --> 22:11.413
- Have yourself a good day.
- Yeah, you too.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.031
Mommy.

22:53.872 --> 22:54.873
I'm sorry.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.667
It's okay.

22:58.376 --> 23:01.213
You look like
you could use it more than us.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.174
This is not who I am.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.636
I was trying to do something good
for my kids.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.472
My wife said I was working all the time
and never saw my kids

23:10.472 --> 23:13.141
and they'd be grown up before I knew it.
That made me sad.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.145
So I took some time off
because she was right,

23:17.145 --> 23:19.022
you don't get that time back.

23:19.022 --> 23:21.942
My dad was always gone,
but he sold typewriters.

23:21.942 --> 23:24.528
Not just typewriters--
That doesn't matter.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.071
We came to Disney World.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.281
Do you know how expensive that is?

23:28.824 --> 23:30.700
Every drink comes in a collector's cup,

23:30.700 --> 23:33.245
and you don't have to get that,
but of course you do.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.665
But that's okay. My kids will remember
this trip their whole lives.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.209
Maybe not for the right reasons.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.795
I was just trying to be a good father.

23:42.879 --> 23:45.006
Really, it's okay.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.135
But you do need to leave now.

23:50.804 --> 23:51.805
Thank you, ma'am.

23:57.853 --> 23:58.770
Ma'am.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.648
How are you set for change?

24:12.284 --> 24:13.285
Goddamn it.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.370
Goddamn it.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.915
Goddamn it!

24:30.218 --> 24:31.803
Hey, Patsy, what's up?

24:31.803 --> 24:34.097
<i>Thought you'd wanna know
your ex-wife came by.</i>

24:34.973 --> 24:36.057
She say why?

24:37.434 --> 24:38.435
<i>You.</i>

24:40.270 --> 24:41.104
Got it.

24:41.104 --> 24:43.982
Um, I'm gonna come over. Okay? See you.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.453
<i>Hey. Where are you?</i>
- Iris is in town.

24:56.453 --> 24:59.831
I don't know where she is right now,
but I just left Ray-Ray at the boat.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.751
Get him away from there.
I have to go to Patsy's.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.589
How hard is it to find one guy?

25:07.589 --> 25:09.090
I even told you where he is.

25:09.090 --> 25:12.010
<i>Do I have to come down there
and do this myself?</i>

25:12.552 --> 25:14.012
Knock yourself out, kid.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.972
It's 100 degrees here.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.349
I'm going home.

25:18.183 --> 25:22.145
And don't ever, ever play
the father card again.

25:22.145 --> 25:25.398
You're lucky he can't see
what a disappointment you are.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.442
<i>You live in his house.</i>

25:27.442 --> 25:30.779
<i>You inherited everything
he ever built. But...</i>

25:31.279 --> 25:34.199
you didn't inherit me.

25:36.826 --> 25:38.620
This guy, what does he look like?

25:40.622 --> 25:41.873
Like a cop.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.251
<i>I don't know. Attractive.</i>

25:44.251 --> 25:48.630
<i>He's from somewhere.
I don't know where, but not here.</i>

25:48.630 --> 25:50.507
<i>That's not racist.</i>

25:50.507 --> 25:52.842
<i>It's just a-- It's a fact.</i>

25:52.842 --> 25:53.927
Shut up!

26:29.504 --> 26:32.173
Excuse me. Detective Padereau. Hi.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.675
Can I ask you a question?

26:33.675 --> 26:37.053
No, no, no. Hey, did that guy call you?
'Cause I got rid of those plants.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.722
- Most of the plants.
- Wait.

26:38.722 --> 26:42.642
My question was about the security cameras
and how I could see the footage.

26:44.519 --> 26:45.729
Oh.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.566
No idea. My uncle does,
but they're trying to save his toe.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.151
Okay, what?

26:51.151 --> 26:52.360
Diabetes.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.239
Why don't you give him a call
and have him talk you through it.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.450
What did Iris tell you exactly?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.577
Nothing. You know how cops are.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.454
Want a chocolate?

27:03.163 --> 27:03.997
Yes.

27:05.206 --> 27:07.375
I prayed you'd come back, you know.

27:07.375 --> 27:08.543
When?

27:08.543 --> 27:10.253
When I was 12 and you left.

27:10.253 --> 27:13.381
Took a while to be answered,
but here you are.

27:13.381 --> 27:15.425
I'd do anything to keep you here.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.887
- I know.
- But if you put my family in danger,

27:18.887 --> 27:21.056
- that changes--
- I wouldn't do that.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.017
Why did you go see Deacon at work?

27:24.768 --> 27:26.311
It's unrelated to the other thing.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.104
The other thing being the dead woman?

27:28.104 --> 27:30.732
Yes. Did you tell Iris anything about her?

27:30.732 --> 27:33.693
No, Michael,
because I don't know anything, do I?

27:33.693 --> 27:35.779
I didn't put you in danger, Patsy.

27:35.779 --> 27:39.783
All I asked was to let me know
if the EMT was gonna make it or not.

27:39.783 --> 27:40.700
That's all.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.578
And he's not,
but his mom is reluctant to pull the plug.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.288
- How reluctant?
- Adamant.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.666
I hope she has a change of heart.

27:48.666 --> 27:51.294
This guy needs someone
to be punished for the dead woman.

27:51.294 --> 27:53.338
If it's not the EMT, it'll be me.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.384
Well, we don't want that.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.639
I'll have a talk with his mom, Michael.

28:02.639 --> 28:03.932
Thanks.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.768
Hey. It's gonna be--

28:07.727 --> 28:09.854
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.273
I promise.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.442
It's under control.

28:15.902 --> 28:16.820
Okay.

28:19.406 --> 28:24.035
Who's your buyer?
Name and place, or you live here. Now.

28:25.161 --> 28:28.373
Meghan, there you are.
I need a quick favor.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.083
Sorry.
- What the hell?

28:30.083 --> 28:32.001
It's okay. Friends since college.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.545
Kappa forever.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.047
I'm in the middle of something.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.507
I just need a phone number.

28:37.507 --> 28:40.552
It's a Philadelphia cell
and I'm trying to track down the owner.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.345
You're that TV lady.

28:42.345 --> 28:43.263
Guilty.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.348
Kaitlin Fox. Hi.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.977
Anyway, here's the number.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.895
His name is Mike Valentine.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.397
You're the best.

29:06.953 --> 29:08.037
<i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

29:08.037 --> 29:10.373
<i>Ray-Ray's bringing the floats
over to the church.</i>

29:11.040 --> 29:12.250
Buzz is getting the truck.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.253
If you wanna get this done tonight,
you better get over here now.

29:15.253 --> 29:16.171
<i>I will.</i>

29:16.171 --> 29:18.465
As soon as I lose the car tailing me.

29:18.465 --> 29:19.674
<i>Who is it?</i>

29:19.674 --> 29:22.010
I don't know. Some old guy in a Buick.

29:22.010 --> 29:25.013
That could be
half the population of Florida.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.806
Just take down the plate.

29:26.806 --> 29:27.849
Okay?

29:38.902 --> 29:39.736
Andy.

29:39.736 --> 29:42.030
Hey, I need you to run a plate.

29:43.698 --> 29:50.163
<i>Pennsylvania D-2-P-4-H-7-8.</i>

29:53.625 --> 29:54.751
Actually, I can't.

29:56.085 --> 29:57.754
How do you mean you can't?

29:57.754 --> 30:00.965
Was that Mike
in the sketch that I showed you, chief?

30:01.591 --> 30:03.676
Oh, Andy. Goddamn it. Come on.

30:03.676 --> 30:05.094
This is important.

30:06.387 --> 30:07.680
Yes or no?

30:14.771 --> 30:15.814
No.

30:19.108 --> 30:23.404
Well, I guess I don't mean I can't.
I mean I won't.

- Hey.
- Hey. You ditch your tail?

31:08.116 --> 31:11.619
- Yeah. Any idea who that is?
- His name is Dutch.

31:11.619 --> 31:14.330
He used to work for Moss's dad.
He's retired.

31:14.330 --> 31:17.166
He's the one that Moss called
to check on Gil Franco's story.

31:17.166 --> 31:20.920
- Used to work for him in what way?
- Like the way Gil ended up.

31:20.920 --> 31:24.090
- How did you spot him?
He came to the motel room.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.800
What? Did he recognize you?

31:25.800 --> 31:28.177
He didn't act like it,
but he knew I was with someone.

31:28.177 --> 31:29.846
He saw your stuff in the bathroom.

31:29.846 --> 31:32.807
- You let him into the bathroom?
- He had to pee. It seemed urgent.

31:32.807 --> 31:36.603
- Prostate. It happens.
- Shit! Moss is checking up on your story.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.938
It'll be okay.
- It's already not.

31:38.938 --> 31:43.318
If he wanted you dead, you would be.
Clearly this guy is after me.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.945
- And now he's found you.
- Doing nothing to report on.

31:45.945 --> 31:48.281
Plus, he wasn't even on me until...

31:48.907 --> 31:51.534
- You were at Patsy's house.
- He knows where she lives.

31:51.534 --> 31:53.828
- Wow. Now you're worried.
- No, wait.

31:53.828 --> 31:56.247
He knows where I was.
Not that it was Patsy's house.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.959
- Who are you calling?
- Ray-Ray.

31:59.959 --> 32:02.712
- I don't want Ray-Ray doing anything.
- I do.

32:02.712 --> 32:05.423
- Anything else I can unfuck for you?
- Everyone calm down.

32:05.423 --> 32:08.051
I'll give Dutch
the same story I gave Moss,

32:08.051 --> 32:11.804
he reports back that everything is fine
and we buy ourselves time. Calm down.

32:11.804 --> 32:13.723
We got a problem.

32:13.723 --> 32:16.392
I couldn't drop off the salvage stuff
at the church.

32:16.392 --> 32:19.812
They're putting in security cameras
to replace the guard who got arrested.

32:19.812 --> 32:21.773
Give me some tools. I'll take care of it.

32:23.149 --> 32:25.151
- What is this?
My boat.

32:25.151 --> 32:27.528
The heat is on you two,
and it's bad for all of us.

32:28.112 --> 32:31.741
Get on the boat, go somewhere.
I promise you'll get your cut.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.994
- You promise?
Yeah.

32:34.994 --> 32:37.872
A promise from Sonny Valentine
is worth even more than gold.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.916
I'm trying to help you.
Are you?

32:39.916 --> 32:42.877
It looks exactly the same
as when you're not.

32:42.877 --> 32:45.088
- Forget it.
- Hey! Go fuck yourself.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.589
Oh, God!

32:49.884 --> 32:53.304
- Never have fucking kids.
- Trust me, I'm not.

32:53.304 --> 32:56.307
- We have to go.
- We will. One more day.

32:56.307 --> 32:59.769
No. Now, Mike.
Moss has activated his murder guy.

32:59.769 --> 33:02.897
- I know, but we're almost there.
- Look at me.

33:02.897 --> 33:07.318
Have you seen me like this ever?
These are serious fucking people.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.028
Even if Dutch didn't recognize me,

33:09.028 --> 33:11.280
he might tell Moss
there was a girl in your room

33:11.280 --> 33:12.615
and give him a description,

33:12.615 --> 33:15.535
and it'll be the same one
they use to identify my corpse.

33:15.535 --> 33:18.538
What do you want to do?
You want to walk away?

33:18.538 --> 33:20.331
Huh? Is that what you want?

33:20.331 --> 33:23.501
No, I'm saying
we take your dad up on the deal.

33:23.501 --> 33:26.504
Yes. I know he'll fuck us over some,

33:26.504 --> 33:28.923
but we'll still have
way more than we need.

33:29.882 --> 33:31.634
I'm saying you were right.

33:31.634 --> 33:35.430
Let's do what you told me to do.
Let's take the boat and go.

33:39.559 --> 33:41.519
I'm not going anywhere.

33:41.519 --> 33:44.564
If we walk away now, my dad takes it all,

33:44.564 --> 33:46.691
and no way I'll let that happen.

33:48.317 --> 33:49.652
I'm not leaving twice.

33:51.654 --> 33:53.573
Not without what's coming to me.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.120
I'll be back.

34:00.496 --> 34:01.831
I hope you're here.

34:06.669 --> 34:07.795
I will be.

34:08.296 --> 34:11.883
In a series of small packages
just scattered all over town.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.546
Mike's pretty fired up.

34:51.798 --> 34:53.883
Look what you started, I guess.

34:54.801 --> 34:57.053
Oh, no.
Whatever that fire is, I didn't light it.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.180
No. You just blew on it.

35:00.139 --> 35:01.182
Nice.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.686
This is a you story
I'm so privileged to be in the middle of.

35:06.854 --> 35:07.855
Hey, slow down.

35:09.148 --> 35:11.275
You need to have a clear head for tonight.

35:12.318 --> 35:13.569
I'm sorry, and why is that?

35:14.362 --> 35:17.907
Since you two have pretty much
sidelined me on this thing,

35:17.907 --> 35:20.159
I'm not sure I'm sticking around.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.383
<i>Oh, you will.</i>

35:36.175 --> 35:37.760
You love the drama.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.599
I don't even have anywhere to stay
if I do.

35:43.599 --> 35:45.643
I'm not going back to that motel.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.230
You can stay at my place.
I'll crash with Ray-Ray.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.565
Thank you.

35:51.399 --> 35:54.152
You know Bonnie and Clyde
was a love story too.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.195
<i>You know how that ended.</i>

36:06.664 --> 36:07.748
Hey.

36:20.261 --> 36:21.179
Good news.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.348
I've decided not to kill you.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.852
Ought to be a load off. Me?

36:29.395 --> 36:30.646
I'm still on the fence.

36:32.648 --> 36:33.774
You must be Dutch.

36:36.819 --> 36:38.237
Why must that be?

36:38.237 --> 36:40.031
You're Moss's guy in Florida.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.867
He sent you to check on me?

36:43.409 --> 36:44.744
See what I was doing?

36:46.913 --> 36:47.830
Look...

36:48.831 --> 36:52.418
What I'm doing is exactly
what I told Moss that I was doing.

36:52.418 --> 36:54.754
But you know he has trust issues.

36:58.841 --> 37:03.554
What is it you told Moss you were doing?
Just so I'm on the same page.

37:05.514 --> 37:08.559
Getting video evidence
on the guy who killed his girlfriend.

37:12.271 --> 37:13.773
- At a church?
- Yeah.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.399
Here, at that bar.

37:16.150 --> 37:18.110
The bungalow when he killed her.

37:18.694 --> 37:19.946
Everywhere they went.

37:20.696 --> 37:24.325
Why not just give Moss what you have
when you get it?

37:25.534 --> 37:29.121
- Why make him worry?
- You used to work for his dad, right?

37:30.498 --> 37:32.959
- Thirty-five years.
- So you know Moss?

37:34.126 --> 37:37.046
Do you consider him a patient
and rational person?

37:37.046 --> 37:38.756
I consider him...

37:39.966 --> 37:41.842
- a fucking moron.
- There you go.

37:41.842 --> 37:46.138
If I told him only part of the story,
he'll go apeshit and screw it up,

37:46.722 --> 37:48.140
so I just need one more day.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.851
He gets what he needs. I get what I need.

37:50.851 --> 37:55.106
And you can get a small gratuity
for not saying anything just yet.

38:00.194 --> 38:01.570
How small?

38:04.323 --> 38:07.618
Five grand.
That will get you better cigars.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.955
I like these cigars.

38:12.581 --> 38:14.166
My father smoked these.

38:14.792 --> 38:18.504
Well, then 5,000 of those, I don't care.
What do you say?

38:20.715 --> 38:24.510
Another five will get me a TV that pauses.

38:25.803 --> 38:26.971
You got a deal.

38:28.347 --> 38:30.182
- Who's this?
- Let's get into your car.

38:30.182 --> 38:31.934
- Fuck you.
Let's go here.

38:31.934 --> 38:35.313
- Fuck off. Get your fucking hand off me.
- Go over there!

38:35.313 --> 38:37.189
- Fuck!
- Get in there.

38:51.245 --> 38:54.665
Goddamn it stinks in here!

38:54.665 --> 38:57.877
What can I say? Light a match. Stay there!

38:57.877 --> 39:00.129
- Move.
- He's not gonna say anything.

39:00.129 --> 39:04.633
I said, get out of the way because
if it's a choice of your life or Patsy's,

39:04.633 --> 39:07.887
I believe I have Sonny's proxy
to make the right call.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.513
No!

39:09.513 --> 39:11.766
Motherfucker!

39:16.020 --> 39:17.480
Ah! Fuck!

39:17.480 --> 39:19.315
Let's see what you have here.

39:22.401 --> 39:23.402
Stop.

39:24.487 --> 39:25.654
When was this?

39:25.654 --> 39:29.700
Uh, today?
That's the guy. That's the asshole.

39:33.162 --> 39:34.413
You'll break my arm!

39:36.874 --> 39:38.709
No, no, no.

39:41.670 --> 39:42.713
You crazy?

39:49.428 --> 39:50.721
Oh!

39:56.519 --> 39:58.604
No! I'm not going to let you kill him.

39:58.604 --> 40:00.815
- You know why I have to.
- Why?

40:00.815 --> 40:03.484
You can't do bad things but be a good guy.

40:07.655 --> 40:10.825
There he is again.
That's the day that he pulled my hair.
