00:01.702 --> 00:04.738
(traffic whooshing)

00:04.772 --> 00:07.808
*

00:07.841 --> 00:09.743
(horn blares)

00:13.114 --> 00:15.015
(horn blaring, tires screeching)

00:16.584 --> 00:17.585
(horn honks)

00:17.618 --> 00:18.619
(woman huffs)

00:20.721 --> 00:22.723
(horns blaring)

00:29.563 --> 00:31.265
ATTENDANT:
Hey, hold it!

00:39.840 --> 00:41.575
Go! Go down that hall!

00:41.609 --> 00:42.843
Go. Go there!

00:42.876 --> 00:44.078
AGENT:
Go, go!

01:09.303 --> 01:11.071
Don't move!
Hands in the air!

01:29.757 --> 01:31.192
BRIAN FINCH:
Hi.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.526
My name is Brian Finch

01:32.560 --> 01:34.128
and the first thing
you should know about me

01:34.162 --> 01:35.363
is I didn't do anything wrong.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.431
Well, not the kind of wrong
that leads

01:37.465 --> 01:39.233
to having a gun
in your face, anyway.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.568
I'll explain.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.802
There were a few mistakes
along the way.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.737
Five expulsions,

01:43.771 --> 01:45.739
four misdemeanors,

01:45.773 --> 01:47.575
three fake I.D.'s,

01:47.608 --> 01:49.210
two attempts at the 11th grade,

01:49.243 --> 01:51.312
and a partridge in a pear tree.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.581
(school bell ringing)
I always thought I'd find
something different.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.416
Something... I don't know,

01:55.449 --> 01:56.784
great?

01:56.817 --> 01:58.852
Something like this.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.721
* Ain't no easy way out...

02:00.754 --> 02:02.623
I loved it.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.258
When my dad asked me what
I planned to do with myself,

02:04.292 --> 02:06.527
I actually had
something to say.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.795
Then time passes.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.365
Everyone around you
starts to grow up,

02:11.399 --> 02:12.833
and when your break
is slow to come,

02:12.866 --> 02:14.635
people fall away.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.737
Eli, the guy
I started the band with,

02:16.770 --> 02:19.440
he was the first to quit.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.941
It starts to feel like
no one told you

02:20.974 --> 02:22.743
you were playing a game
of musical chairs.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.313
Get a job, get married,

02:25.346 --> 02:27.215
get a life,
what are you waiting for?

02:28.449 --> 02:31.619
The song is gonna stop playing
any second now.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.455
* Ooh, I gotta get away

02:34.488 --> 02:36.790
* Ain't no easy way out.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.326
(scattered applause)
So that's the thing.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.793
I wouldn't really
call it a band, per se.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.362
It's a project, um,

02:41.395 --> 02:43.331
and it has its own name, but...

02:43.364 --> 02:45.566
I'm the only one involved,
so, uh, we're self-releasing...

02:45.599 --> 02:47.768
So when you say
you're the only one involved,

02:47.801 --> 02:50.671
when you say "we," you mean...

02:50.704 --> 02:52.706
I mean me.

02:52.740 --> 02:53.707
Mm-hmm.

02:53.741 --> 02:54.808
"Me" is "we."

02:54.842 --> 02:56.344
Or is the other way around?

02:56.377 --> 02:58.979
We is me, me is we?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.548
Anyway, it's called
"Resorbed Twin."

03:00.581 --> 03:03.651
And, uh, the album goes
on Bandcamp next week.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.786
Oh.
FATHER:
That's great.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.588
Right? That's great!

03:07.621 --> 03:09.790
So, Brian, can I hear it?

03:10.991 --> 03:11.959
Uh...

03:11.992 --> 03:13.961
it's embargoed right now.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.798
Uh, but I'll let you know
right away.

03:17.831 --> 03:18.966
Good.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.601
MOM:
Who wants dessert?

03:20.634 --> 03:21.769
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.804
Yes, all around? Sure.
(grunts)

03:23.837 --> 03:24.705
Dennis?
Dad?
Dad?

03:24.738 --> 03:26.707
Dennis, Dennis...
Dad.
(plate breaks)

03:26.740 --> 03:28.409
Dad? Let's go, come on.
Are you okay?

03:28.442 --> 03:30.878
BRIAN: That was the first time
my dad collapsed.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.547
There were more.

03:33.581 --> 03:36.317
Three in the next two months,
and still,

03:36.350 --> 03:38.786
nobody could figure out
what was wrong with him.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.321
Hey, Dad.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.590
Hey.
Hey, Brian.

03:42.623 --> 03:43.624
Sorry I'm late.

03:43.657 --> 03:44.725
I ended up playing

03:44.758 --> 03:46.694
till 2:00 in the morning
last night.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.596
And Jason from the club
forgot to pay me.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.763
I need to go back today.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.465
You know what? Never mind.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.534
How are you?
How was the scan?

03:53.567 --> 03:54.768
Did you hear anything?

03:54.802 --> 03:56.270
No.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.339
Maybe it'll find something
this time, hmm?

03:58.372 --> 04:00.741
Well, you know what?
I was thinking

04:00.774 --> 04:02.710
that maybe I should come out
to the house for a little while.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.944
You know?

04:03.977 --> 04:05.879
Just till they figure
this whole thing out.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.881
Wait a minute.
You want to move back home?

04:07.915 --> 04:11.519
Well, yeah...
not 'cause I need to, Dad.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.354
Uh, I don't know.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.323
I don't know.
I got your mom.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.524
I'm getting around okay.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.860
What would you do?

04:19.893 --> 04:21.862
What do you mean?

04:21.895 --> 04:23.997
What are you offering,
Brian?

04:24.031 --> 04:26.667
How would you help? Tell me.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.736
BRIAN:
He wasn't trying to be mean;
that's not my dad.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.071
But he was saying a lot more
than he meant to.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.606
Help?

04:32.640 --> 04:33.907
I could barely
take care of myself.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.043
Other people had careers.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.911
Me? I was a temp.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.647
Manchester-Reid Bancorp
is the eighth

04:39.680 --> 04:41.515
or ninth biggest
bank on Wall Street,

04:41.549 --> 04:42.683
depending on
how you measure.

04:42.716 --> 04:43.884
Everyone who works here

04:43.917 --> 04:45.719
just took a sexual
harassment seminar--

04:45.753 --> 04:47.388
it's a liability thing--

04:47.421 --> 04:49.690
and then they signed a form
acknowledging that they went.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.460
These are the signed forms,

04:52.493 --> 04:53.927
those are our
employee files.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.030
Your job is to put each form
into the proper file.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.599
We have 22,000
employees.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.300
We figure it'll
take you two weeks.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.104
(phone ringing)

05:04.137 --> 05:05.873
Jessamyn Eubanks.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.676
I didn't break up with Teddy;
I just didn't take the ring.

05:08.709 --> 05:09.910
Doesn't mean
we broke up.

05:09.943 --> 05:10.911
No, it doesn't...

05:10.944 --> 05:12.913
(snoring)

05:15.516 --> 05:16.950
MAN:
Brian.
(snort)

05:16.984 --> 05:18.819
Brian!

05:18.852 --> 05:21.689
Yep. I'm, uh...
(clears throat)

05:23.991 --> 05:26.427
Wh... Eli?

05:26.460 --> 05:27.828
(scoffs)

05:27.861 --> 05:30.564
What are you, uh,
what are you doing here?

05:30.598 --> 05:32.666
Couple guys
out on the floor

05:32.700 --> 05:34.134
told me the temp
was snoring back here.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.604
I can't believe
it's you.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.006
You're an investment banker.
Yeah.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.908
BRIAN: Well, I mean,
I wouldn't call it a band,

05:40.941 --> 05:42.810
per se. Um...

05:42.843 --> 05:44.578
It's a project.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.680
Uh, but, uh,
I'm the only one involved.

05:46.714 --> 05:47.848
Man, I'm so glad
you're still making music.

05:47.881 --> 05:48.782
That's awesome.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.484
Hey, do you have the
record on your phone?

05:50.518 --> 05:51.885
Let's-let's listen
to it right now.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.154
(sighs)

05:54.187 --> 05:55.889
Eli...

05:55.923 --> 05:57.758
there is no album.

05:57.791 --> 06:01.161
I haven't written a song
in, like...

06:01.194 --> 06:02.830
God, over a year.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.698
Why not?

06:04.732 --> 06:05.999
(sighs)

06:06.033 --> 06:07.000
I don't know, man.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.502
I just...

06:08.536 --> 06:09.937
I can't concentrate.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.040
My dad's sick.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.877
What's wrong with him?

06:16.910 --> 06:18.612
They're not sure.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.814
If he doesn't
get better...

06:22.616 --> 06:24.618
I mean, my dad might die.

06:24.652 --> 06:25.886
(scoffs)

06:25.919 --> 06:28.622
What has he seen me accomplish?

06:31.659 --> 06:33.994
You know,
I might be able to help.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.197
You carry around
a money clip now?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.231
Yeah.

06:38.265 --> 06:39.867
I got the biggest bonus
in the bank last quarter

06:39.900 --> 06:41.034
and they gave me this.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.536
Yeah.
It's got my initials.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.004
That's awesome.
Yeah, I know, uh...

06:44.037 --> 06:47.708
20-year-old me would punch
28-year-old me in the face.

06:47.741 --> 06:48.742
Here.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.444
Okay...
Take it.

06:50.478 --> 06:51.479
(groans, sighs)

06:51.512 --> 06:52.480
It'll give you, like...

06:52.513 --> 06:53.547
I don't know, a-a jump-start.

06:53.581 --> 06:54.582
What is that?

06:54.615 --> 06:55.949
Is it some kind of speed?
No.

06:55.983 --> 06:56.950
That's not where I'm...

06:56.984 --> 06:58.085
Hey. You hear of modafinil?

06:58.118 --> 06:59.453
Mm-mm.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.954
Neuroenhancers?

07:00.988 --> 07:02.556
Well, it's like that.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.957
Just better.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.794
A lot better.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.095
(sighs)

07:08.128 --> 07:11.164
I don't think that...
Hey, Brian...

07:12.766 --> 07:14.067
I don't think you understand

07:14.101 --> 07:15.469
what I'm offering you here.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.106
*

07:21.108 --> 07:23.110
"A jump-start."

07:24.678 --> 07:26.647
Okay.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.981
What did I have to lose?

07:28.015 --> 07:29.817
Here... we... go.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.086
JESSAMYN:
Yeah, I filled out

07:33.120 --> 07:35.088
his business school
applications.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.090
Yep, essays too.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.092
BRIAN:
Wow, awesome joke, Eli.

07:39.126 --> 07:39.860
He's smart, Mom,
he is.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.895
He's just...
you know, he's Teddy.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.864
Okay?
And I don't think

07:43.897 --> 07:44.998
that we should be
getting engaged right now...

07:45.032 --> 07:46.934
BRIAN:
Then it happened.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.871
The scales fell from my eyes.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.575
Your brain is a miracle,

07:54.608 --> 07:56.243
but it's not efficient.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.946
There's a maze inside
everyone's head,

07:58.979 --> 08:01.615
a labyrinth
of missed connections

08:01.649 --> 08:03.751
and untapped potential.

08:03.784 --> 08:06.053
...business school applications.
Because he wasn't gonna do it.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.188
But now, suddenly,
I had access...

08:08.221 --> 08:08.922
...'cause he's Teddy.

08:08.956 --> 08:12.025
...to every single brain cell.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.762
That guy looks familiar,
doesn't he?

08:16.697 --> 08:18.065
Who are you?

08:18.098 --> 08:19.099
You know who he is.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.769
You remember a lot more
than you think you do.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.710
Every experience
you've ever had,

08:29.743 --> 08:32.245
every idea that came to you
in the shower

08:32.279 --> 08:34.114
and then slipped away while
you were brushing your teeth--

08:34.147 --> 08:36.049
it's all there for the taking.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.119
The bank wants to know who's
leaving them open to a lawsuit.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.988
They should probably know
about the guy

08:41.021 --> 08:44.057
whose frat got kicked off campus
for selling a date-rape drug.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.563
This guy's had five
female assistants in a year.

08:49.597 --> 08:50.598
What's the story there?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.636
Two weeks.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.171
She told me
it would take two weeks.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.740
I guess I got carried away,

08:59.773 --> 09:01.975
'cause I was done in two hours.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.678
So, yeah,
I read every file in here.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.880
Then I sorted them into
five tiers of potential risk.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.115
It was pretty intuitive.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.650
Tier one is color-coded green.

09:09.683 --> 09:10.784
They're your safest employees.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.219
Tier five, the reds,

09:12.252 --> 09:15.188
is reserved for
total undesirables.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.290
This is incredible.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.158
One more thing:

09:18.191 --> 09:20.728
Break up with Teddy.
You deserve better.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.063
But you know that; that's why
you turned down the ring.

09:23.096 --> 09:26.066
We've been together so long.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.234
It's scary, I know.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.236
But you'll be fine.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.671
You're about to get
a promotion.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.240
This filing system?
You're taking credit for it.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.842
Then you're getting a bump
to vice president,

09:34.875 --> 09:35.843
you spend six months there.

09:35.876 --> 09:36.677
Then it'll be the bank that pays

09:36.710 --> 09:37.645
for you to go
to business school.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.346
How did you know
I was thinking about an MBA?

09:39.379 --> 09:41.181
I know you filled out the
applications for your ex.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.250
I didn't talk
to Teddy yet.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.052
You're as smart
as anyone who works here.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.854
How could you not think
about an MBA?

09:46.887 --> 09:48.188
You know what else?

09:48.221 --> 09:50.290
They've got no women
on the board.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.859
(whispering):
They've never had one.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.226
That's gotta change.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.162
You could run this place,
Jessamyn.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.730
I'm not a CEO.

09:56.764 --> 09:57.765
Yeah, but you can be.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.132
You can have
the job you want,

09:59.166 --> 10:01.034
you can have a guy
that understands you...

10:01.068 --> 10:02.202
You deserve it.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.204
All you gotta do
is know how to ask.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.775
Kind of seems like
you understand me.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.876
Of course I do.

10:08.909 --> 10:09.943
I read your file.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.146
*

10:13.180 --> 10:15.716
I remember this feeling.
The world is mine.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.151
I just have to decide
what to do with it.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.789
*
BRIAN:
Hey!

10:22.723 --> 10:24.024
Do you mind if I play?

10:24.057 --> 10:25.192
It'll just take a second.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.996
(plays spectacular guitar riff)

10:29.029 --> 10:31.198
My dad gave me a lesson or two
when I was a kid,

10:31.231 --> 10:32.900
but to be completely
honest with you,

10:32.933 --> 10:34.301
it never really clicked
until... now.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.870
Re-brand. You don't
sell hot dogs anymore;

10:36.904 --> 10:38.338
you sell artisanal
hot dogs.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.439
That's the next thing.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.941
(playing skillfully)

10:44.411 --> 10:46.079
Cupcakes are on the way out.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.816
The mavens never embraced pie,
so that's not happening.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.450
Did you read The Tipping Point?
You know about mavens?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.720
*

10:56.123 --> 10:58.759
I'm telling you, Cesar,
if you build it, they will come.

10:58.792 --> 10:59.893
Checkmate.

10:59.927 --> 11:00.994
Checkmate.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.063
Checkmate.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.099
We should play for money.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.172
(crowd cheers)

11:12.205 --> 11:14.441
I dabble.

11:14.474 --> 11:17.310
Dad, watch this.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.946
FATHER:
Nice.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.949
BRIAN: My brother's
medical school textbooks

11:21.982 --> 11:23.250
were still
at my parents' place.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.119
Nobody else could figure out
what was wrong with my father.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.821
Why can't I?

11:29.957 --> 11:32.826
Suddenly, I knew exactly
what I was looking for.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.765
This.

11:37.798 --> 11:41.101
A picture of my grandparents
on their honeymoon.

11:41.134 --> 11:44.938
Her eyes, they're
the same as Dad's.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.924
It runs in the family.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.760
Ever been hungover?

12:06.794 --> 12:09.229
Yeah, this was like that,
just worse.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.298
A lot worse.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.866
Oh, Brian, you look awful.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.868
Good morning.

12:14.902 --> 12:15.769
Dad.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.741
I think you've got
something called, um...

12:24.077 --> 12:25.512
...hemochromatosis.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.415
It's caused by a trait
that runs in our family.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.050
Uh, Grandma Helen had it,
your cousin Scott.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.953
You've got it the worst out
of anybody though and, um...

12:32.986 --> 12:36.523
it's 'cause your body
can't process iron...

12:36.556 --> 12:38.325
All right, stop! Just stop.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.327
You spend one night
on the floor

12:40.360 --> 12:41.895
and suddenly you're
a doctor, Brian?

12:41.929 --> 12:43.797
BRIAN: Dad, listen to me
for a second, okay?

12:43.831 --> 12:46.266
Now, the inherited version
of hemochromatosis is-is

12:46.299 --> 12:48.869
one of the most misdiagnosed
diseases that there is.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.170
Doctors mistake it for...

12:50.203 --> 12:52.973
dozens of other things.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.507
And if they can't find it,
how could you?

12:54.541 --> 12:55.408
It's a long story.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.812
But there is a test
that they can run

12:58.846 --> 13:01.514
called a, uh, transferrin
saturation test.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.517
And, um...

13:04.551 --> 13:07.187
I-I think you guys
should take that.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.889
Today.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.225
(cell phone rings)

13:12.259 --> 13:13.894
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
You have one new message.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.229
MOM: Brian, uh,
I don't know how you knew,

13:16.263 --> 13:17.898
but you were right.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.033
Your father has hemochromatosis.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.368
But with your dad,

13:21.401 --> 13:24.905
the doctor said it's
concentrated in his liver.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.373
And they say he needs
a transplant.

13:26.406 --> 13:30.377
But they say they're not sure
he'll get an organ in time.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.913
Call me.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.182
BRIAN: So, in the end,
that pill got me past

13:35.215 --> 13:37.117
one problem I could never
solve on my own

13:37.150 --> 13:39.419
and dumped me right
in front of another one.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.621
Find a liver?

13:41.654 --> 13:42.990
How do you even do that?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.926
I needed another pill.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.236
Hello?

13:56.269 --> 13:57.938
Eli?

14:04.277 --> 14:05.612
Oh, my God...

14:10.350 --> 14:11.351
(quietly):
Oh, my God...

14:14.955 --> 14:16.389
I gotta call the police.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.390
Wait...

14:17.424 --> 14:18.391
if I'm gonna help my dad,

14:18.425 --> 14:19.960
I better find those pills.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.437
Oh, God.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.640
The money clip was gone,
the place was trashed,

14:33.673 --> 14:34.641
but whoever tore it apart,

14:34.674 --> 14:37.210
obviously didn't know Eli
as well as me.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.678
He always kept a backup stash

14:38.711 --> 14:40.580
taped to the inside
of his acoustic.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.322
(pounding on door)

14:49.356 --> 14:50.991
MAN: Open up, Eli!
Open up!

14:51.024 --> 14:52.325
I need to talk
to you!

14:52.359 --> 14:53.626
Whatever's coming
through that door,

14:53.660 --> 14:56.930
I'm pretty sure Brian Finch
is not qualified to handle it,

14:56.964 --> 14:58.932
not without help.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.233
AGENT:
Clear!

15:00.267 --> 15:03.636
Eli's phone-- that could
come in handy.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.513
It doesn't look like
there's a fast way out here.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.015
But what if suddenly you knew

15:15.048 --> 15:17.617
how much strength
you had in your hands?

15:17.650 --> 15:19.619
I mean exactly how much,

15:19.652 --> 15:21.688
down to the moment the last
muscle fiber would give.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.090
Hey!

15:23.123 --> 15:24.157
FBI!

15:28.095 --> 15:29.129
(grunts)

15:49.516 --> 15:52.019
*

16:02.662 --> 16:04.664
(horns honking)

16:10.103 --> 16:12.605
(horns honking)

16:16.076 --> 16:19.646
Three paths,
three potential outcomes.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.082
It's tempting to head
into the park

16:22.115 --> 16:23.716
until you remember
the mayor just doubled

16:23.750 --> 16:25.418
the foot patrols
in Union Square.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.324
I could try one more mad dash
across the street...

16:33.060 --> 16:34.261
...but let's not push that.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.263
Subway it is.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.031
Don't move, hands in the air.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.044
WOMAN:
Hey!

16:51.078 --> 16:53.380
Dumb idea? Sure.

16:53.413 --> 16:57.650
But what if you could remember
every documentary you ever saw?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.086
Every trig class?

16:59.119 --> 17:00.420
Could you do the math?

17:00.453 --> 17:02.122
Could you figure out exactly

17:02.155 --> 17:03.823
where that train
is going to stop?

17:03.856 --> 17:08.095
If you're positive that
the driver could see you,

17:08.128 --> 17:11.264
I think you could get
pretty close.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.433
90% sure.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.737
Maybe 80%.

17:24.177 --> 17:28.148
And if you could remember
that there's an abandoned track

17:28.181 --> 17:30.383
next to the L stop
in Union Square,

17:30.417 --> 17:34.721
then the dumbest stunt
you ever pull...

17:34.754 --> 17:37.390
might just turn out to be...

17:37.424 --> 17:40.760
the smartest moment
of your life.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.209
REBECCA:
His name's Brian Finch.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.377
We ran stills from the subway

17:57.410 --> 17:59.379
through facial
recognition software.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.215
He profiles
as basically no one.

18:02.249 --> 18:05.452
And yet he got away
from six of our agents.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.653
I saw him jump in front
of the L train

18:06.686 --> 18:08.788
and bring it to a dead stop
like he was playing chicken.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.490
You're making a point?

18:10.523 --> 18:11.691
He knew the train
was gonna stop.

18:11.724 --> 18:15.695
Why did you ask us to bring
Eli Whitford in for questioning?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.497
What did you expect
to find in his apartment?

18:19.332 --> 18:22.435
There's an explanation
for what you saw today.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.306
REPORTER: ...firm that Finch
is the leading suspect...

18:26.339 --> 18:29.176
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: In 2011,
the DEA picked up a dealer

18:29.209 --> 18:32.779
selling a nootropic
compound he called NZT-48.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.447
We don't know
where it came from.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.749
But it affects multiple
regions of the brain.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.752
The cognitive enhancements were
like nothing you've ever seen.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.389
I mean, we recorded stuff in the
lab that would make you rethink

18:42.422 --> 18:44.324
the whole idea
of the impossible.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.658
"The lab"?

18:45.692 --> 18:47.427
You're a resourceful
woman, Rebecca.

18:47.460 --> 18:51.598
I'm sure you can imagine
multiple applications for NZT.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.500
Everyone in the study was either
from Central Intelligence

18:53.533 --> 18:56.369
or the Bureau--
they all volunteered.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.305
We reverse-engineered
the compound.

18:58.338 --> 19:02.409
The pictures on the right were
taken a year into the study.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.277
My God.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.946
The program was called off
after the first two fatalities.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.415
They just...

19:08.448 --> 19:10.250
closed up shop?

19:10.283 --> 19:13.353
We don't know how Brian Finch
is connected to NZT.

19:13.386 --> 19:17.357
But there are some important
eyes looking at this.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.492
You'll have all
the resources you need.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.494
Find him.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.496
Is it me, or did the
whole world just change?

19:23.530 --> 19:24.631
We can't think
about it that way.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.499
It's a fugitive case,
let's work it.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.467
I'll go see Finch's parents.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.502
You want to get the word out
to other agencies?

19:29.536 --> 19:30.970
Yeah. Hey.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.640
On that subway platform,
you had your gun on him,

19:33.673 --> 19:35.675
the shot was clean,
why didn't you take it?

19:41.381 --> 19:43.483
Crowd spooked me.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.518
A lot of ricochet
in a concrete tunnel.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.756
You have to take care of this
yourself, you know that, right?

19:49.789 --> 19:51.724
They think you killed Eli.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.993
But you know that already,
that's why you took Eli's phone.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.529
Once you turn it on,
the GPS will ping to a tower

19:56.563 --> 19:58.565
in about 40 seconds,
so work fast.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.802
(various overlapping voices
chattering rapidly)

20:06.473 --> 20:08.308
MAN: Eli, my connect's
out of pills.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.442
Honey can't find any either.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.378
We got to dig deep.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.845
Have to stay ahead
of the pack at M-R.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.382
"M-R," that's
Manchester-Reid.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.017
There are two other people
at the bank using NZT.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.553
Eli's income went up
by a factor of ten

20:20.587 --> 20:22.555
when he was taking those pills.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.524
So did this guy's, Jay Winston.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.727
And this guy's,
Adam Honeycutt.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.729
Adam Honeycutt.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.731
Jay Winston.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.267
Those are the other
people using NZT.

20:34.301 --> 20:37.270
Winston has listed a hotel
in SoHo as his address.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.272
He's living out of a suite.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.407
It's about
two miles from here.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.941
Go there first.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.345
MOM:
Brian?

20:45.378 --> 20:48.047
You're sure
you mean our son?

20:48.080 --> 20:51.584
The safest option for your son
is to surrender.

20:51.618 --> 20:54.821
If he calls,
please tell him that.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.823
I'm-I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.326
He was friends with Eli.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.629
Brian wouldn't kill him.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.566
Maybe not the Brian you know.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.636
But... if he's using,

21:09.669 --> 21:11.504
then he isn't
that person anymore.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.506
Uh, uh, Agent Harris,
let me ask you a question.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.541
You-you have kids?

21:14.574 --> 21:15.975
No.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.644
Right, so this will
make it difficult

21:17.677 --> 21:19.979
for you to understand.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.848
Brian is lost in the world,

21:21.881 --> 21:25.385
and I can believe that he
is mixed up with this drug.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.586
But you're wrong
about one thing.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.956
Our son is not a murderer.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.563
BRIAN: The news made this big
thing about my leather jacket,

21:36.596 --> 21:39.532
so I took the coat and scarf
from a coat check.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.100
Sorry for stealing your coat,
Tanner Evans,

21:41.133 --> 21:45.605
but to be honest, you seem like
a little bit of a douche.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.974
Now I just have to get
into Jay Winston's suite.

21:50.443 --> 21:52.745
I have tried to pick
a lock before.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.581
* Let's get it on...

21:54.614 --> 21:55.648
Different kind of situation.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.950
Keep a slight turning pressure
while doing this.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.553
Now, the pick is used
to manipulate the pins.

22:00.587 --> 22:03.990
A torque wrench
is inserted into the key way,

22:04.023 --> 22:05.958
in such a fashion
as to push the pin upward

22:05.992 --> 22:07.994
to unlock a pin code.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.568
Three people at Manchester-Reid
are taking the pills,

22:15.602 --> 22:18.538
and two of them die
inside 18 hours?

22:18.571 --> 22:20.072
This isn't a suicide.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.642
Someone's killing these guys
for their NZT.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.913
The first pill I took
lasted about 12 hours.

22:26.946 --> 22:30.049
I have time to make one more
move before I come down.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.505
You get lost in your work.

22:52.539 --> 22:53.940
You didn't hear me come in.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.776
It's not there.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.547
What do you want?

23:00.580 --> 23:02.048
I can't tell you
who killed Eli yet.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.850
But I can tell you a lot.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.918
You're an FBI agent.
You can go places I can't.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.687
You have resources
I don't.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.490
We're gonna figure out
who really did it.

23:18.064 --> 23:18.931
If you hand me
my gun right now,

23:18.965 --> 23:19.932
I probably won't shoot you.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.835
There are other people
at the bank using NZT.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.537
One of them
is named Jay Winston.

23:24.571 --> 23:27.106
Right now, he's lying dead
in a hotel suite in SoHo.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.175
It's set up to
look like a suicide,

23:29.208 --> 23:31.578
but I think the same person
killed Eli and Jay.

23:31.611 --> 23:34.180
If Winston had the drug, that
gives you motive to kill him.

23:34.213 --> 23:37.884
Does it give me motive to come
here and tell you about it?

23:37.917 --> 23:39.151
Someone is killing the people

23:39.185 --> 23:42.789
who are using NZT
at Manchester-Reid.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.657
That's Jay Winston's laptop.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.893
He has several e-mails from
someone with the user name

23:46.926 --> 23:48.895
"Hapaboy"-- there's
nothing in here that says

23:48.928 --> 23:50.897
what Hapaboy's real name is,
but he used to work with Jay.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.733
He's at one of the big banks.
I just don't know which one.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.935
He knows Jay was using
something to get ahead.

23:55.968 --> 23:56.936
He wants in.

23:56.969 --> 23:58.705
Your story's got
lots of threads

23:58.738 --> 24:01.474
for me to pull on.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.109
Most lies told by addicts do.

24:03.142 --> 24:06.579
(sighs)
What is it with you?

24:06.613 --> 24:07.514
(scoffs)

24:07.547 --> 24:10.016
Some part of you
has to believe I'm right.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.451
That's why you didn't shoot me
on that platform.

24:16.088 --> 24:20.026
Oh! You lost someone in
your family to addiction.

24:22.028 --> 24:23.630
Night of the Gun,
How To Stop Time--

24:23.663 --> 24:25.097
those are memoirs by addicts.

24:26.533 --> 24:27.634
Was it your mother?

24:27.667 --> 24:29.268
Stop.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.538
I'm serious. Now.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.508
No, wait...

24:35.542 --> 24:39.111
That's the most recent
picture of your dad.

24:39.145 --> 24:42.014
It's at least ten years old.

24:42.048 --> 24:45.918
You think I'm impressed that you
can stomp around in my life?

24:45.952 --> 24:48.988
You're not smart, you're high.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.090
I'm not lying, though.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.258
Leave.

24:56.062 --> 24:58.230
I'm not gonna take your gun.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.934
I know you'd get
in trouble for that.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.545
How's my father?

25:12.579 --> 25:15.948
You wouldn't know all that
without talking to my parents.

25:15.982 --> 25:19.051
He looks really sick.

25:19.085 --> 25:20.953
I spent the night in a hotel

25:20.987 --> 25:22.154
that was closed
for renovations.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.224
My stomach did backflips
as soon as the pill wore off.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.259
I told the FBI everything...

25:27.293 --> 25:30.329
except for the name of
the third guy taking NZT--

25:30.362 --> 25:32.632
Adam Honeycutt.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.667
If he's still alive,
he has pills.

25:38.738 --> 25:39.839
Hey.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.908
"Hapa"-- that's Hawaiian.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.275
It means someone
of mixed heritage.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.644
Can you help me hit
the HR departments

25:44.677 --> 25:46.212
on Wall Street?

25:46.245 --> 25:48.147
See if there's a trader
with a Hawaiian background?

25:48.180 --> 25:49.949
Someone about Eli's age?

25:49.982 --> 25:51.951
You're checking Finch's story?

25:51.984 --> 25:53.252
He breaks into
your apartment,

25:53.285 --> 25:55.187
holds your sidearm on you.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.889
I can't figure out why, though.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.625
It was a huge risk.

25:58.658 --> 25:59.826
Plus, Brian gave me
good information,

25:59.859 --> 26:01.093
and then he left my gun behind.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.595
Would a guilty guy do that?

26:02.629 --> 26:03.896
"Brian"?

26:03.930 --> 26:05.632
Finch, whatever.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.233
Hey.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.769
I'll do it.

26:09.802 --> 26:10.803
Thanks.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.110
(grunts quietly)

26:19.178 --> 26:20.379
Oh!
No, look! Wait, wait, wait!

26:20.412 --> 26:21.914
Wait, do you know who I am?

26:21.948 --> 26:23.182
I didn't kill Eli.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.817
I didn't kill Jay.

26:24.851 --> 26:26.919
I came here for an NZT pill.

26:26.953 --> 26:29.221
No, go away, man!
I was gonna steal it.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.823
I was gonna steal it.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.992
Okay? But only to prove
who killed Eli.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.994
And to help my dad, okay?

26:35.027 --> 26:37.263
Listen, I'm not what
they say on the news.

26:37.296 --> 26:40.266
I'm not a bad person.

26:40.299 --> 26:41.801
But I need help.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.836
Okay?

26:45.672 --> 26:47.073
Oh, God...

26:47.106 --> 26:49.809
I believe you.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.844
I believe you.

26:54.981 --> 26:57.016
Oh, my God.

26:57.049 --> 27:00.252
Eli used to talk about you
all the time.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.755
He was jealous
of you.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.223
He gave up.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.725
You never did.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.395
I can help.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.163
I'll get you a pill.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.168
(groans in pain)

27:16.202 --> 27:17.870
(rattling)

27:17.904 --> 27:21.140
Just a rattle, right?

27:21.173 --> 27:22.842
No big deal.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.311
But it made me curious.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.313
Adam's apartment
was immaculate.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.381
Like, OCD immaculate.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.383
Everything was symmetrical.

27:31.417 --> 27:34.420
Almost everything.

27:34.453 --> 27:37.189
The plant on the right,
it's maybe

27:37.223 --> 27:38.858
two inches higher
than the other one.

28:07.954 --> 28:09.255
(grunts)

28:24.003 --> 28:26.005
(gasps, groans)

28:42.955 --> 28:44.957
(grunting, gasping)

28:48.527 --> 28:50.496
You were
running out of NZT.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.131
You took care of Eli and Jay.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.833
You took their pills.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.534
Yeah, I should have
got rid of that.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.169
Your buddy Eli
was a snake.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.105
He shorted the market
using my research.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.273
So, really, the biggest
bonus-- that money clip--

29:01.307 --> 29:02.541
they were mine.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.810
He was a good person.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.511
And you murdered him.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.213
And you're going to jail.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.015
You planning on
going to the police?

29:09.048 --> 29:11.784
Hey, you want to
call 'em, right now?

29:11.818 --> 29:15.221
I mean, I can't wait to tell 'em
how I shot the fugitive

29:15.254 --> 29:18.224
who came looking for
some drug called NZT.

29:20.226 --> 29:20.993
Which, by the way,
Brian, I'm not

29:21.027 --> 29:23.262
stupid enough to
keep where I live.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.197
Here's how I see it:

29:25.231 --> 29:26.999
Maybe you pass out
from that hole in your leg.

29:27.033 --> 29:28.400
Maybe you get arrested.

29:28.434 --> 29:31.070
Or maybe I find you

29:31.103 --> 29:32.839
before anyone
with a badge can.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.843
Either way...

29:36.876 --> 29:38.878
works out fine for me.

29:46.318 --> 29:48.220
(groans loudly)

29:50.222 --> 29:52.224
(phone ringing)

29:57.629 --> 29:59.331
Hello?
BRIAN: Guess what?

29:59.365 --> 30:01.300
I was wrong about Hapaboy.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.369
Brian?
Mm-hmm.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.972
(whispers):
It's Finch?

30:06.005 --> 30:08.274
Um... I know.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.209
His real name
is Andrew Benn.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.879
He's been vacationing in
Honduras the last two weeks.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.915
The killer's name
is Adam Honeycutt.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.284
And, uh...
I can't prove it yet,

30:18.317 --> 30:19.886
but, um, he did

30:19.919 --> 30:23.189
kind of, uh... he shot me.
(clears throat)

30:23.222 --> 30:24.323
What?
Yeah.

30:24.356 --> 30:25.524
Are you at a hospital?

30:25.557 --> 30:27.193
No. I, I-I...

30:27.226 --> 30:28.995
But they-they-they train
you guys, right?

30:29.028 --> 30:31.030
To-to patch up bullet wounds?
Like, in case of

30:31.063 --> 30:33.032
emergencies or something?
They tell us

30:33.065 --> 30:36.235
to get to a hospital.
Yeah, well,

30:36.268 --> 30:39.005
I can't do that, so...
You want me to coach you
through patching

30:39.038 --> 30:41.340
a bullet wound? Why would you
expect me to do that?

30:41.373 --> 30:43.075
Because I'm innocent.

30:43.109 --> 30:45.077
Where is the bullet?

30:45.111 --> 30:46.445
Is it in your leg, still?

30:46.478 --> 30:49.148
I don't know.
No, I think it just grazed me.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.583
Is the blood bright red
or is it dark?

30:51.617 --> 30:53.385
Dark, I think.
Okay, that's good.

30:53.419 --> 30:54.987
That means it didn't
hit an artery.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.556
Mm.
We're gonna patch the wound.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.558
If there's any cloth in there,
that can get infected.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.627
Okay.
So do you have a knife?

31:01.660 --> 31:03.629
Do you, do you have
tweezers or something?

31:03.662 --> 31:05.131
Uh...

31:06.665 --> 31:08.100
Tweezers?

31:08.134 --> 31:09.368
Yeah.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.370
Yeah, uh-huh. I g...

31:11.403 --> 31:13.039
What-what are we
using these for?

31:13.072 --> 31:15.007
'Cause I can't go
digging around in my own leg.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.275
Yes, you can.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.344
Think about something else
and just do it.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.979
Uh, okay, how?

31:20.012 --> 31:22.381
How am I supposed
to think about something else?

31:22.414 --> 31:24.250
Um...

31:24.283 --> 31:25.451
You like egg creams, right?

31:25.484 --> 31:29.221
The ones from Isaac's
on Forest Hills?

31:29.255 --> 31:31.623
Yeah.
How did you know about that?

31:31.657 --> 31:34.293
I saw a picture in your house.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.262
(chuckles)
Hey...

31:36.295 --> 31:38.364
y-you know something, um...

31:38.397 --> 31:40.599
my mom...

31:40.632 --> 31:43.235
always wanted me to be a doctor.

31:43.269 --> 31:44.403
(laughs)

31:44.436 --> 31:47.273
Instead, I...

31:47.306 --> 31:49.308
I-I turned out to be...

31:52.078 --> 31:54.080
...nothing, I guess.

31:55.481 --> 31:56.715
Brian...

31:56.748 --> 31:59.085
you're gonna
get through this, okay?

31:59.118 --> 32:01.087
I am gonna
talk you through this.

32:05.424 --> 32:08.294
Oh!

32:08.327 --> 32:09.728
(grunting)

32:09.761 --> 32:11.163
Brian?

32:30.616 --> 32:33.385
(clanking, rattling)

32:39.091 --> 32:41.060
What are you doing?

32:41.093 --> 32:43.162
Combat gauze, stitches.

32:43.195 --> 32:45.164
It's not perfect,
but you won't bleed out.

32:45.197 --> 32:47.533
Unless you get
your dumb ass shot again.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.601
Oh, her bedside
manner's unorthodox,

32:49.635 --> 32:52.138
but you are in expert hands.

32:55.174 --> 32:56.175
It's about time
you and me talked.

33:02.248 --> 33:05.217
(groaning, coughing)

33:05.251 --> 33:07.653
Do you know who I am?

33:07.686 --> 33:09.321
Oh. Oh, God.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.523
(panting)

33:11.557 --> 33:13.759
I've been tracking you
ever since you first bumped

33:13.792 --> 33:16.162
into the FBI
at your friend's apartment.

33:16.195 --> 33:16.962
And then, when they last
traced your call,

33:16.995 --> 33:18.564
one of my sources
intercepted and...

33:18.597 --> 33:21.500
here we are.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.335
Why?

33:23.369 --> 33:25.237
I'm nobody.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.106
Everybody says
you're gonna be president soon.

33:27.139 --> 33:29.141
I haven't officially
announced that yet,

33:29.175 --> 33:31.443
but between me and you, I don't
even know if I'm gonna run.

33:31.477 --> 33:32.811
Do you know how much time
we get off in the senate?

33:32.844 --> 33:34.080
It's shocking, really.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.248
I don't know
if I can give it up.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.384
One NZT pill.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.552
I give this to you.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.489
If you're not the killer,
you can go prove it.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.425
But what are you
gonna do after that?

33:46.458 --> 33:48.660
Go back to temping?

33:48.694 --> 33:52.231
Every day a little closer
to 30... 40.

33:52.264 --> 33:53.599
I know what that's like.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.534
It's lonely.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.169
God.

33:57.203 --> 33:59.171
Your body craves it
faster and faster, yeah.

33:59.205 --> 34:01.540
You think it's bad now,
it's only gonna get worse.

34:01.573 --> 34:04.543
You actually might remember
this moment as the last time

34:04.576 --> 34:06.545
you felt vaguely human.

34:06.578 --> 34:09.448
But it doesn't have
to be that way, Brian.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.283
I took a pill
this morning.

34:11.317 --> 34:13.519
I've taken a pill every morning
for the past four years.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.454
I can't remember
the last time I felt bad.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.688
That's not true.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.425
No, I had a headache
two years ago.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.560
How... how did you...
how did you do that?

34:21.593 --> 34:23.195
That.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.132
(clicks, squeaks, hisses)

34:26.165 --> 34:28.600
Millions of dollars
of private research.

34:28.634 --> 34:30.836
It works
on a cyclical enzyme system.

34:30.869 --> 34:33.539
Oh, you don't know what
that means. It doesn't matter.

34:33.572 --> 34:36.542
All you need to remember
is that every so often,

34:36.575 --> 34:39.611
you take one of these shots.

34:39.645 --> 34:43.482
And you can have as much NZT as
you want with no side effects.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.419
You're on the verge
of having a life

34:47.453 --> 34:49.821
that most people
can't even begin to imagine.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.260
Can you remember what it's like

34:54.293 --> 34:56.228
to be inside
your mother's womb?

34:56.262 --> 34:58.530
I can.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.666
I think about it
when I need to relax.

35:00.699 --> 35:04.570
Have you ever thought
about why people have to age?

35:04.603 --> 35:06.572
Is it inevitable?

35:06.605 --> 35:07.873
I'm not sure.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.811
So-so, wait. What-what the hell
are you offering me?

35:12.844 --> 35:15.347
You're offering me one pill?

35:15.381 --> 35:17.683
Well, if things go the way
I expect they will,

35:17.716 --> 35:20.219
you're gonna have as much NZT
as you need.

35:20.252 --> 35:22.554
Why? Why would you help me?

35:22.588 --> 35:24.290
Let's just say
I need somebody in a position

35:24.323 --> 35:25.624
that you soon
will be qualified to fill.

35:25.657 --> 35:26.692
But one thing.

35:26.725 --> 35:31.397
This conversation is here
and now and nowhere else.

35:31.430 --> 35:35.601
You describe it to the FBI,
to your parents, to anyone...

35:35.634 --> 35:38.237
I will let you die
more painfully and slowly

35:38.270 --> 35:39.605
than you can fathom.

35:41.807 --> 35:45.444
So what's it gonna be, Brian?

35:45.477 --> 35:47.579
You ready to become somebody
who matters?

35:58.624 --> 36:00.592
BRIAN:
One pill.

36:00.626 --> 36:03.695
One last chance
to prove I'm innocent.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.762
There's one piece of evidence
Adam wouldn't get rid of.

36:36.795 --> 36:39.731
I just have to get to it.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.607
(laughing):
Hey, buddy.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.609
Are you sure you're wearing
the right name tag?
What?

36:50.642 --> 36:52.578
Yeah.
Hey, did you ever see

36:52.611 --> 36:54.846
one of those instructional
videos about pickpocketing?

36:54.880 --> 36:57.649
All you have to do is create
one slight misdirection,

36:57.683 --> 36:59.451
and you can steal just about
anything, like this gun.

36:59.485 --> 37:01.720
Hey, don't worry
about it, Francis.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.289
I'm not gonna hurt anyone, okay?

37:03.322 --> 37:05.291
Excuse me, everyone.
I'm robbing the place.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.625
Sorry.

37:06.658 --> 37:08.627
Just try to stay calm.

37:08.660 --> 37:11.663
You can hit
the silent alarm now.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.665
You want me
to hit the alarm?

37:13.699 --> 37:15.767
Call the FBI, too,
ask for Rebecca Harris.

37:15.801 --> 37:19.338
Tell her Brian Finch just
walked in here with a gun.

37:21.373 --> 37:24.810
There's a lot of people
out there, huh?

37:24.843 --> 37:26.812
What are we doing here, Brian?

37:26.845 --> 37:27.779
Did you know that
Adam Honeycutt

37:27.813 --> 37:29.281
does his banking here?

37:29.315 --> 37:30.882
He had to fill out
financial disclosure forms

37:30.916 --> 37:32.418
when he came over
to Manchester-Reid.

37:32.451 --> 37:33.619
I read it all.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.787
He told me he
doesn't keep any NZT

37:35.821 --> 37:37.556
in his apartment,
but according

37:37.589 --> 37:40.926
to the manager here, he has a
safety deposit box downstairs.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.529
Let's go see what's inside.

37:45.464 --> 37:46.765
(whirring)

37:58.577 --> 38:00.546
Look at that watch.

38:04.816 --> 38:07.353
(rattling)

38:11.890 --> 38:14.626
You see that?

38:14.660 --> 38:16.928
That's Eli Whitford's blood.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.997
I see it.

38:19.030 --> 38:22.000
Well, in that case, I surrender.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.002
WOMAN (on TV):
And the police are still trying
to piece this all together.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.003
Just a short time ago,

38:25.036 --> 38:26.572
we spoke with the victim's
mother, and she...

38:26.605 --> 38:29.441
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.

38:29.475 --> 38:32.911
I just got copies
of Brian Finch's CT scans.

38:32.944 --> 38:35.714
You've seen the NZT files.
Does that look right?

38:35.747 --> 38:38.717
Brian took at least
two doses of NZT.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.118
His brain should be
rewiring itself.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.787
And yet, he presents

38:41.820 --> 38:43.455
as a perfectly healthy
28-year-old.

38:43.489 --> 38:46.792
Brian's immune to
the side effects of taking NZT.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.960
We don't know how, but
we certainly plan on learning.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.596
You want to study Brian
to figure out

38:50.629 --> 38:51.997
how to make a safe version
of the drug.

38:52.030 --> 38:55.834
Whoever created NZT--
still a mystery, by the way--

38:55.867 --> 38:57.503
may be out there
giving it to anybody.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.004
This is an arms race, Rebecca,

38:59.037 --> 39:01.006
and Brian could help us win it.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.508
He's a person.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.109
A good one, actually.

39:04.142 --> 39:06.512
Am I the only one
that's thinking about this?

39:10.682 --> 39:13.819
If Brian's
gonna take NZT anyway,

39:13.852 --> 39:15.887
then every time he takes it,
he basically becomes

39:15.921 --> 39:17.523
the smartest
person in the world.

39:17.556 --> 39:19.057
That's a resource.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.660
Let's make it our resource.
You're talking

39:21.693 --> 39:23.962
about putting him to work?
Call him a consultant.

39:23.995 --> 39:26.732
We can still study him,
yes, but...

39:26.765 --> 39:28.500
make the bank charges disappear.

39:28.534 --> 39:31.002
Let's move him into the
safe house in Greenpoint.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.170
I'll be his liaison.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.006
You trust him
with that kind of power?

39:35.040 --> 39:36.675
(laughs)

39:36.708 --> 39:40.512
I'm not sure I trust anyone
with that kind of power, but...

39:40.546 --> 39:41.847
if we keep him here,
I can watch him,

39:41.880 --> 39:44.683
and we can use him.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.885
Brian has the potential
to be more effective

39:46.918 --> 39:48.687
than every agent
in this division

39:48.720 --> 39:51.189
combined.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.591
(sucking loudly)

39:54.059 --> 39:55.994
(sighs)
No.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.796
No?

39:57.829 --> 39:59.765
Not unless you can
get my father a new liver.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.600
You do that,
I'll do whatever job you want.

40:01.633 --> 40:04.035
We don't work that way.
Well, start.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.204
Someone, somewhere
up the food chain--

40:06.237 --> 40:08.106
they can move him up
the transplant list.

40:08.139 --> 40:10.442
If I'm as important
as you say I am,

40:10.476 --> 40:12.611
then you find
that person-- or don't.

40:12.644 --> 40:15.947
Brian... you're out on bail.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.148
You could go to prison.

40:17.182 --> 40:19.017
And even if you don't,
do you really

40:19.050 --> 40:20.752
want to go back
to your old life?

40:21.787 --> 40:24.590
I'd do anything to save my dad.

40:26.992 --> 40:28.059
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Nurses station.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.995
(knocking)

40:30.028 --> 40:31.096
Heard you got some luck.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.964
Brian.

40:32.998 --> 40:35.467
They're really
operating tomorrow?

40:35.501 --> 40:38.637
You know, you don't have to
pretend that this is a surprise.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.105
The lady from the FBI

40:40.138 --> 40:42.007
was in this morning to visit me.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.476
(sighs)

40:44.510 --> 40:46.144
She wouldn't give me
any details,

40:46.177 --> 40:47.846
but she said that...

40:47.879 --> 40:49.915
she said that

40:49.948 --> 40:52.684
you made this happen.

40:53.719 --> 40:55.854
What happened to you?

40:57.088 --> 40:59.190
You look different.

41:00.659 --> 41:03.161
Yeah, I'll tell you
all about it sometime.

41:03.194 --> 41:05.997
Oh, boy, I'm proud of you, kid.

41:06.031 --> 41:07.966
You don't even know
what I did.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.835
I don't need to
know what you did.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.003
I woke up this morning
feeling scared.

41:12.037 --> 41:14.005
Tomorrow, I'll wake up
feeling hopeful.

41:14.039 --> 41:15.173
You did that.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.910
You saved my life.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.882
Thank you.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.587
REBECCA:
You were right, you know.

41:28.620 --> 41:31.923
About my father.

41:31.957 --> 41:35.126
He used for ten years,
when I was a kid.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.963
My mom finally moved me
and my sister out of the house

41:37.996 --> 41:40.131
in the middle of the night.

41:40.165 --> 41:44.235
He cleaned up after
I joined the Bureau.

41:44.269 --> 41:46.938
He came to see me one
night last year, and...

41:46.972 --> 41:49.174
something was off.

41:49.207 --> 41:52.711
He said
he'd been blind his whole life,

41:52.744 --> 41:55.013
but now, tonight,

41:55.046 --> 41:57.115
he could see.

41:57.148 --> 41:59.284
When he left,

41:59.317 --> 42:02.688
he said the next time I saw him,
he'd be a different person.

42:02.721 --> 42:05.123
A better person.

42:06.725 --> 42:09.995
Three weeks later, his body
floated up in the East River.

42:11.897 --> 42:14.032
I'm sorry.

42:14.065 --> 42:16.034
You know what I remember
about that night?

42:17.202 --> 42:18.970
His eyes.

42:19.004 --> 42:22.140
They had this shine.

42:22.173 --> 42:26.077
Just like yours did
on that subway platform.

42:27.679 --> 42:29.147
That's why you didn't shoot me.

42:29.180 --> 42:32.017
I think my father was
on NZT that night.

42:32.050 --> 42:34.052
And if I can figure out
where it comes from,

42:34.085 --> 42:36.955
maybe I can figure out
what happened to him.

42:38.256 --> 42:40.191
You agreed to do a job, Brian.

42:40.225 --> 42:42.894
It's time.

42:44.329 --> 42:46.965
Just don't lie to me.

42:46.998 --> 42:49.100
Ever.

42:54.339 --> 42:56.341
(sighs)

42:56.374 --> 42:58.576
You sure about this?

43:00.846 --> 43:02.848
I couldn't help my father.

43:03.982 --> 43:05.984
Maybe I can help you.
