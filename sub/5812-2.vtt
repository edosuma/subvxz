WEBVTT

00:40.742 --> 00:42.709
(gasps)

00:47.682 --> 00:49.849
You lied.

00:49.851 --> 00:51.918
I'm not free.

00:52.754 --> 00:54.921
Well, you got that right,
asshole.

00:57.092 --> 00:59.892
It's your own
damned fault,

00:59.894 --> 01:02.061
thinking you could
cheat death.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.697
Mm-mm.

01:04.699 --> 01:05.932
(clicks tongue)

01:11.906 --> 01:13.973
(sobs quietly)

01:18.346 --> 01:19.912
WOMAN (echoing faintly):
Help...

01:25.887 --> 01:27.687
Help!

01:28.623 --> 01:30.890
(screams)

01:30.892 --> 01:32.125
Help!

01:32.127 --> 01:34.293
Help!

01:34.295 --> 01:37.130
(sobs)

01:37.132 --> 01:38.765
Help!

01:38.767 --> 01:41.267
(sucking noises)

01:41.269 --> 01:43.136
Help!

01:43.138 --> 01:45.738
Help!

01:45.740 --> 01:47.640
Can't you shut her up?

01:47.642 --> 01:49.809
I can hear her
through the duct.

01:49.811 --> 01:51.644
Did you forget
a cop is staying here?

01:51.646 --> 01:53.880
He's away at work.
(Agnetha whimpering)

01:53.882 --> 01:55.948
She'll stop.

01:55.950 --> 01:58.251
She always gives up
after a minute.

01:58.253 --> 02:00.353
(Agnetha falls silent)
See?

02:03.758 --> 02:04.824
Yuck.

02:04.826 --> 02:06.192
Tastes gross.

02:12.734 --> 02:14.100
That's 'cause she's dead.

02:14.102 --> 02:15.468
Stop.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.377
(humming quietly)

02:44.799 --> 02:46.165
It's a horror!

02:46.167 --> 02:49.669
I'll have to use ammonia
to refresh these linens.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.509
I've always admired
the Swedes and their chocolate.

02:56.511 --> 02:58.344
It's a wonder
they stay so thin.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.613
Chocolate's the Swiss.

03:14.229 --> 03:16.295
(flies buzzing)

03:37.685 --> 03:39.919
(whirring)

04:04.012 --> 04:06.345
Get some juice
and cookies.

04:18.393 --> 04:20.459
(opera playing)

04:22.230 --> 04:23.529
That's the last of it.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.031
Thank you.

04:26.868 --> 04:28.868
Where's Donovan?
Getting dressed,
I hope.

04:28.870 --> 04:31.003
It's just been a while
since I've seen him--

04:36.544 --> 04:38.611
THE COUNTESS:
You're torturing that woman.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.449
I was a junkie because I wanted
to escape from my mother.

04:43.451 --> 04:46.152
You made it so I never can.

04:48.990 --> 04:50.256
Why haven't you changed?

04:50.258 --> 04:52.992
We're going to miss the opening.

04:52.994 --> 04:55.695
We don't have space
for any more art.

05:05.139 --> 05:08.441
Ah...

05:08.443 --> 05:10.509
Besides...

05:10.511 --> 05:12.345
you don't have the money, babe.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.017
We're not going
for the art, dumbass.

05:20.922 --> 05:23.155
We're going for the hunt.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.757
We just fed.

05:26.160 --> 05:29.161
Come on.
Let's stay in.

05:29.163 --> 05:32.164
We could binge-watch
<i> House of Cards.</i>

05:46.981 --> 05:49.348
¶ ¶

06:18.012 --> 06:20.479
¶ ¶

06:27.021 --> 06:32.725
¶ Caressing the marble
and stone ¶

06:32.727 --> 06:38.030
¶ Love that was special
for one ¶

06:38.032 --> 06:43.169
¶ The waste
and the fever and hate ¶

06:43.171 --> 06:49.942
¶ How I wish you were
here with me now. ¶

08:06.154 --> 08:07.753
ALEX:
You're very brave, Max.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.657
We're almost done here.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.859
MRS. ELLISON:
Do you think that
this could be strep?

08:13.861 --> 08:15.694
I looked on WebMD
and they said...

08:15.696 --> 08:17.329
Stay off the Internet.

08:19.133 --> 08:20.733
It'll only make your head spin.

08:23.271 --> 08:26.105
Can you breathe in for me, Max?

08:26.107 --> 08:27.640
(inhales, coughs)

08:27.642 --> 08:29.942
He sounds terrible, doesn't he?

08:29.944 --> 08:32.011
(Max coughing)

08:34.115 --> 08:35.781
Hang in there.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.216
We're gonna get you all better.

08:37.218 --> 08:39.485
Don't worry.

08:39.487 --> 08:42.021
I'm just gonna talk to your
mom for a minute, okay?

08:56.204 --> 08:57.536
Your son has the measles.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.371
Oh, the measles?

08:59.373 --> 09:00.706
Thank God.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.074
I thought it was
something serious.

09:02.076 --> 09:04.977
The measles are serious,
Mrs. Ellison.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.579
And completely unnecessary.

09:06.581 --> 09:08.314
If you had followed my advice

09:08.316 --> 09:10.316
and had Max vaccinated,
then we wouldn't be...

09:10.318 --> 09:11.917
We did what
we thought was right.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.185
Okay? All that stuff out there

09:13.187 --> 09:14.920
about how vaccines
can lead to autism,

09:14.922 --> 09:16.722
how they can
actually kill people...

09:16.724 --> 09:18.224
Measles
kill people.

09:18.226 --> 09:19.725
Children.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.227
Millions in the
developing world,

09:21.229 --> 09:22.995
until pretty
recently.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.897
But you don't live in the
developing world, Mrs. Ellison.

09:24.899 --> 09:26.565
You live on the West Side
of Los Angeles.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.534
And believe me, there are
plenty of real threats

09:28.536 --> 09:32.271
right outside these doors
for you to be worried about.

09:37.578 --> 09:41.614
Look, our children are at risk
from so much in this world.

09:41.616 --> 09:44.383
We can never protect them from
all of it.

09:44.385 --> 09:46.018
But when there's something
we can do

09:46.020 --> 09:48.621
to make them just a little
bit safer, we do it.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.393
So what's the treatment?

09:54.395 --> 09:55.928
There isn't one.

09:55.930 --> 09:58.397
Tylenol to keep
his fever down,

09:58.399 --> 09:59.932
lots of liquids.

09:59.934 --> 10:01.200
And rest.

10:01.202 --> 10:03.202
Something you
won't be getting

10:03.204 --> 10:04.803
in the next couple
weeks, I'm afraid.

10:06.240 --> 10:09.074
Call me if his
fever spikes again.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.476
Okay.

10:24.258 --> 10:26.325
(radio starts playing
"Body and Soul")

10:35.803 --> 10:37.536
(radio shuts off)

11:05.666 --> 11:08.334
(knocking at door)

11:08.336 --> 11:11.270
Turndown service?

11:11.272 --> 11:13.906
No.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.514
(exhales)

11:23.517 --> 11:25.584
(gasps)

11:46.674 --> 11:48.741
("Body and Soul" playing)

12:11.165 --> 12:12.664
(panting)

12:12.666 --> 12:14.233
(flies buzzing)

12:18.105 --> 12:19.371
(gasps)

12:19.373 --> 12:21.373
("Body and Soul" playing)

12:21.375 --> 12:24.076
(muffled sounds of breathing,
crackling)

12:32.553 --> 12:35.154
(ghostly rushing sounds)

12:57.945 --> 12:59.478
Holden!

13:02.983 --> 13:04.383
Holden!

13:09.623 --> 13:12.391
Holden!

13:14.161 --> 13:15.494
Holden!

13:16.564 --> 13:18.797
Holden!

13:34.415 --> 13:35.514
Holden...

13:49.597 --> 13:52.264
SALLY:
Are you looking for someone?

13:52.266 --> 13:53.665
I guess not.

13:55.436 --> 13:59.505
SALLY:
This place is bat-shit crazy,
you know.

13:59.507 --> 14:03.442
Weird things go down,
especially at night.

14:03.444 --> 14:06.612
You look like
you could use a drink.

14:08.816 --> 14:10.849
Oh.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.452
I know that look.

14:13.454 --> 14:16.488
Hanging onto your sobriety
like it's the last train

14:16.490 --> 14:20.459
out of Dodge.

14:20.461 --> 14:22.728
Bring him a ginger ale,
Cleopatra.

14:24.865 --> 14:28.767
The hour between 2:00 and 3:00
a.m. is always the worst.

14:37.144 --> 14:40.012
So I take it
you live here?

14:40.014 --> 14:42.147
I do.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.715
How long?

14:43.717 --> 14:46.084
Too long.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.054
And I'm not a hooker

14:49.056 --> 14:51.323
if that's
what you're wondering.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.726
I wasn't.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.696
I can't help
but wonder how come--

14:57.698 --> 14:59.865
How come a girl like me ends
up with tracks in her arms

14:59.867 --> 15:01.767
living in this dump?

15:04.438 --> 15:07.606
That's one way to put it.

15:09.677 --> 15:11.710
Patti Smith said that my poems

15:11.712 --> 15:15.614
were like glass shattering.

15:15.616 --> 15:18.684
I wrote a song with her.

15:18.686 --> 15:21.553
And then she wrote me off.
(laughs)

15:21.555 --> 15:23.889
Why?

15:23.891 --> 15:26.592
'Cause of the smack?

15:29.930 --> 15:33.565
Getting high used to be like
how you imagine heaven.

15:33.567 --> 15:35.701
Pure light.

15:35.703 --> 15:39.538
The perfection of it all.

15:39.540 --> 15:42.808
Even in me.

15:47.715 --> 15:49.748
Then I got lost.

15:49.750 --> 15:53.619
Kept trying to climb higher.

15:53.621 --> 15:57.289
Get closer to that light.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.725
Like an endless ladder
where all you do

15:59.727 --> 16:03.629
is get further
and further away.

16:07.668 --> 16:11.737
There's a part of you that wants
to get lost, am I right?

16:15.175 --> 16:17.809
Climb that ladder.

16:28.322 --> 16:30.922
Tell me
about your very last

16:30.924 --> 16:32.824
drunk.

16:32.826 --> 16:36.662
What kind of day was it?

16:41.702 --> 16:44.403
I like details.

16:55.149 --> 16:57.249
Started like most days.

16:58.719 --> 17:01.486
<i> Multiple homicide</i>
<i> in Glassell Park.</i>

17:01.488 --> 17:03.455
Dad here spent
the year in prison

17:03.457 --> 17:04.723
for second-degree
assault.

17:06.360 --> 17:08.727
We figure he couldn't
take the pressure,

17:08.729 --> 17:10.862
so he poisons them all,

17:10.864 --> 17:12.097
and blows his brains out.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.739
(indistinct radio transmission)

17:37.491 --> 17:40.792
(helicopter flying outside)

17:50.104 --> 17:53.772
Well, at least
they died peacefully.

18:15.729 --> 18:17.262
Broccoli.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.898
Somebody cared.

18:19.900 --> 18:22.134
What happens to a man,

18:22.136 --> 18:24.202
makes him murder
his own kids?

18:36.917 --> 18:40.152
He didn't.

18:42.389 --> 18:45.924
<i> His power had been turned off,</i>

18:45.926 --> 18:49.661
<i> so he brings in</i>
<i> a portable generator</i>

18:49.663 --> 18:51.963
<i> so his kids can stay warm.</i>

18:57.504 --> 19:00.972
<i>Comes back from his night shift</i>

19:00.974 --> 19:04.342
<i> finds his whole family dead</i>

19:04.344 --> 19:08.780
<i>from carbon monoxide poisoning.</i>

19:08.782 --> 19:11.183
<i> That's enough</i>
<i> to make a man shoot himself.</i>

19:11.185 --> 19:12.784
(gunshot)

19:12.786 --> 19:15.854
I had two kids
at the time.

19:15.856 --> 19:20.025
Holden and Scarlett.

19:22.796 --> 19:25.096
I didn't make
it back home

19:25.098 --> 19:27.165
for two days.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.167
Then the day I came home,

19:29.169 --> 19:31.336
I took the family
to the beach.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.972
Some kind of
desperate gesture

19:33.974 --> 19:36.775
to earn my wife's
forgiveness.

19:36.777 --> 19:40.178
(laughs)

19:40.180 --> 19:43.148
It almost worked.

19:43.150 --> 19:46.852
Holden! Holden!

19:46.854 --> 19:49.788
But my son...

19:49.790 --> 19:53.658
Holden?

19:53.660 --> 19:57.062
I lost him.

20:08.542 --> 20:13.545
I can't afford to get lost.

20:25.058 --> 20:28.693
So, you were right
about our Bel Air vic.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.363
He was pumped full
of male potency drugs.

20:31.365 --> 20:32.864
Near lethal dose.

20:32.866 --> 20:35.166
They still have him
in the induced coma.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.035
Something interesting though.

20:37.037 --> 20:38.904
Both victims had the same
text on their cell phone.

20:38.906 --> 20:40.772
Each asking the other to
meet them at the Bel Air.

20:40.774 --> 20:42.874
Only, they didn't
send them to each other.

20:42.876 --> 20:44.843
You mean a third party
spoofed both their numbers?

20:44.845 --> 20:48.880
Our killer has
some tech savvy.

20:48.882 --> 20:50.048
That's your mom.

20:50.050 --> 20:51.483
We have to go.

20:56.890 --> 20:58.423
John, you have a package.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.191
A package?

21:00.193 --> 21:01.693
Hotel Cortez.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.361
That's where you're
staying, right?

21:11.104 --> 21:13.305
Let's evacuate the building!

21:13.307 --> 21:14.973
Get the bomb squad down here!

21:14.975 --> 21:17.042
(indistinct radio transmission)

21:29.623 --> 21:32.157
MAN:
Okay.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.964
It's not a bomb.

21:38.966 --> 21:40.932
I mean, we can take it outside
and detonate it

21:40.934 --> 21:42.567
if you want to be safe,

21:42.569 --> 21:43.902
but you might want
to take a look first.

21:43.904 --> 21:46.638
Thanks, Ted.
Yeah.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.353
Congratulations.

22:01.355 --> 22:02.687
(chuckles)

22:02.689 --> 22:03.989
Let's run this
down to the crime lab.

22:03.991 --> 22:05.090
Packaging, everything.

22:05.092 --> 22:06.591
Let's run this blood, too.

22:06.593 --> 22:07.993
And see if it matches
any of our victims.

22:24.177 --> 22:26.945
WILL:
Claudia, you made it.

22:26.947 --> 22:29.014
Will, this place.

22:29.016 --> 22:30.949
It's marvelous!

22:30.951 --> 22:33.151
It's like some sad whore that
stayed too long at the party.

22:33.153 --> 22:34.986
(laughs)
I know.

22:34.988 --> 22:36.988
I still can't decide
if I should renovate it

22:36.990 --> 22:39.357
or just let it
decay around me.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.993
A lot of these fixtures
are original, you know.

22:41.995 --> 22:43.161
Mmm.

22:43.163 --> 22:45.497
Uh, can I help you
with something?

22:45.499 --> 22:47.065
Just teaching the folks
from<i> Vogue</i> how to Vogue.

22:47.067 --> 22:48.366
I couldn't resist.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.335
The irony.

22:50.337 --> 22:52.170
Skinny jeans are out,

22:52.172 --> 22:53.905
fringe is in
and ponchos are forever.

22:53.907 --> 22:57.008
Make a note of it.

22:57.010 --> 22:58.510
You will spend the night?

22:58.512 --> 23:00.011
Are you kidding me?
I'm spending the week.

23:00.013 --> 23:01.646
I'll write about fashion.

23:01.648 --> 23:03.982
And I'll sleep
with history.

23:03.984 --> 23:05.717
Tell me.

23:05.719 --> 23:08.420
Does he comes
with the building?

23:08.422 --> 23:12.157
He's one of our residents.

23:12.159 --> 23:14.225
Hi, there.
Room 64?

23:14.227 --> 23:15.326
Policeman, right?

23:15.328 --> 23:16.594
Yeah.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.029
Will Drake,
new owner.

23:18.031 --> 23:19.230
Right.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.366
Claudia Bankson,
<i> Vogue Magazine.</i>

23:21.368 --> 23:23.001
Uh, didn't mean
to crash the party.

23:23.003 --> 23:24.369
I'm just looking
for my daughter.

23:24.371 --> 23:26.104
She was supposed
to be dropped off here.

23:26.106 --> 23:28.473
Daddy!

23:31.044 --> 23:32.410
Dad, guess what?

23:32.412 --> 23:34.946
Officer Pettibone
let me run the siren!

23:34.948 --> 23:37.082
Oh, Officer Pettibone
knows better.

23:37.084 --> 23:38.616
She hit a triple at recess.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.552
Oh, that's-that's my girl.

23:40.554 --> 23:42.053
All right, thanks, Carl.
Sure.

23:42.055 --> 23:43.388
Let's go.

23:43.390 --> 23:45.056
Wow! You live here?

23:45.058 --> 23:46.958
It doesn't always
look like this.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.059
Is it a party?

23:48.061 --> 23:50.095
It is, and you
and your father are invited.

23:50.097 --> 23:51.596
Oh, thanks, but we have
our whole day planned.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.131
Dad!

23:53.133 --> 23:54.365
Honey, this is
a grownup party.

23:54.367 --> 23:55.433
No, it's-it....

23:55.435 --> 23:57.135
She can sit with my son.
Lachlan!

23:57.137 --> 23:59.070
Lachlan, this is Scarlett.
I'll take your tickets.

23:59.072 --> 24:01.106
Come on, man!
Oh...

24:01.108 --> 24:02.373
I need to be
on this list.

24:02.375 --> 24:03.608
Sorry, is there
a problem here?

24:03.610 --> 24:05.143
Yeah, I'm not on the list!

24:05.145 --> 24:06.211
I'm not sure who you are.

24:06.213 --> 24:09.114
I goddamn live here!

24:09.116 --> 24:10.648
It's a private affair, dear.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.217
The event's full.

24:12.219 --> 24:13.351
Maybe next time.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.054
Come on, man.

24:16.056 --> 24:17.989
(crying):
This is my house.

24:17.991 --> 24:20.658
This is my house!
Get off of me!

24:33.306 --> 24:37.475
(whispering):
This is my first fashion show.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.110
My millionth.

24:39.112 --> 24:41.479
Maybe later I'll show you
something really cool.

24:41.481 --> 24:44.682
¶ ¶

24:49.823 --> 24:52.891
(murmuring
and indistinct whispers)

25:05.972 --> 25:08.039
¶ Mama says ¶

25:08.041 --> 25:10.141
¶ Truth is all that ¶

25:10.143 --> 25:13.211
¶ Matters ¶

25:13.213 --> 25:18.149
¶ Lying and deceiving
is a sin... ¶

25:18.151 --> 25:20.985
There's that cop
that moved into 64.

25:20.987 --> 25:24.556
The police don't worry me.

25:24.558 --> 25:27.058
¶ A world that's
torn and tattered... ¶

25:27.060 --> 25:29.694
Mmm, he's very handsome.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.362
You do have a type.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.064
¶ Don't mean a thing... ¶

25:33.066 --> 25:34.232
I'm afraid
we're not much company,

25:34.234 --> 25:35.533
compared to what
you're used to.

25:35.535 --> 25:36.868
Oh, please.

25:36.870 --> 25:38.970
We're so bored
with each other.

25:41.308 --> 25:43.341
We need some excitement.

25:43.343 --> 25:44.876
And we just might get it.

25:46.346 --> 25:50.248
<i> Will booked Tristan Duffy</i>
<i> for the runway.</i>

25:50.250 --> 25:52.750
And with him you can always

25:52.752 --> 25:54.919
<i> expect something</i>
<i> quite unorthodox.</i>

25:54.921 --> 25:58.489
What?

25:58.491 --> 26:01.759
(sniffs)

26:01.761 --> 26:03.528
Whatever.

26:03.530 --> 26:05.597
Let's just do this.

26:05.599 --> 26:08.833
¶ Living for the moment ¶

26:08.835 --> 26:11.269
¶ Lips and lashes ¶

26:14.608 --> 26:18.176
¶ Will I ever
find my way again? ¶

26:21.014 --> 26:23.381
¶ Don't stop ¶

26:23.383 --> 26:26.584
¶ Don't stop the dance ¶

26:28.421 --> 26:30.021
¶ Don't, more music ¶

26:30.023 --> 26:34.092
¶ Don't stop the dance ¶

27:05.759 --> 27:09.060
¶ Don't stop ¶

27:09.062 --> 27:11.629
¶ Don't stop the dance... ¶

27:11.631 --> 27:13.364
(crowd gasps)

27:35.088 --> 27:39.657
¶ Footsteps in the dark
come together... ¶

27:42.996 --> 27:46.764
(applause)

27:48.668 --> 27:52.470
¶ Don't stop ¶

27:52.472 --> 27:54.305
¶ Don't stop the dance... ¶

27:54.307 --> 27:56.374
What was that about?

27:57.310 --> 27:59.677
He's full of rage.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.879
I can still smell it.

28:01.881 --> 28:04.315
(sniffs)

28:04.317 --> 28:06.718
Like copper.

28:09.456 --> 28:12.357
You need to get
your shit together.

28:13.526 --> 28:14.959
The show is not over.

28:17.330 --> 28:19.797
It is for me.

28:26.973 --> 28:29.607
I'm done with modeling.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.548
You can't tell anyone
about this.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.484
It has to be our secret.

28:39.486 --> 28:41.452
I mean it.

28:58.338 --> 28:59.637
Come on, don't be a wuss.

29:25.432 --> 29:26.998
Nothing wakes them up.

29:28.201 --> 29:29.434
Watch.

29:51.124 --> 29:53.191

30:31.798 --> 30:33.498
What do you think
you're doing?

30:33.500 --> 30:35.099
I know there's coke in here.

30:35.101 --> 30:37.468
I can smell it.

30:37.470 --> 30:40.505
(laughs)

30:45.311 --> 30:46.611
Stop

30:46.613 --> 30:49.280
before you make me stop you.

30:49.282 --> 30:50.448
Call the cops, man.

30:50.450 --> 30:52.283
I don't give a shit.

30:52.285 --> 30:54.552
I'm coming out in a
Lars Von Trier movie next year.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.360
(bellowing)

31:05.532 --> 31:07.298
I've made a rule

31:07.300 --> 31:08.699
to stay away from junkies,

31:08.701 --> 31:11.669
but I'm gonna make

31:11.671 --> 31:13.504
an exception with you.

31:13.506 --> 31:15.573
(choking)

31:22.515 --> 31:24.348
Let him go.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.484
(gasping)

31:39.566 --> 31:41.699
Hmm.

31:41.701 --> 31:43.768

32:48.668 --> 32:51.569
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT:
Let me assert my firm belief

32:51.571 --> 32:53.771
that the only thing

32:53.773 --> 32:55.773
we have to fear

32:55.775 --> 32:58.376
is fear itself.

33:11.624 --> 33:13.858
(gagging)

33:15.962 --> 33:18.029
Shit!

33:19.198 --> 33:22.867
(smooth jazz playing)

33:39.018 --> 33:41.085
(music stops)

34:10.817 --> 34:13.984
Take any piece you like.

34:13.986 --> 34:16.687
None of it has
any meaning for me.

34:16.689 --> 34:18.756
You look like you need a drink.

34:21.027 --> 34:22.560
I'm good.

34:27.834 --> 34:29.433
Oh.

34:29.435 --> 34:30.935
Bolivian marching powder.

34:32.105 --> 34:34.071
Too tame for my taste.

34:34.073 --> 34:36.607
I've found a far better way
to stimulate.

34:36.609 --> 34:38.042
What?

34:38.044 --> 34:39.410
I've tried it all, man.

34:39.412 --> 34:41.679
There is nothing better.
(sniffs)

34:41.681 --> 34:44.248
You know.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.951
In your black heart of hearts,
you know.

34:49.555 --> 34:51.789
You're just like me.

34:51.791 --> 34:53.858
I don't think so, dude.

34:55.728 --> 34:57.895
Well, I had it all once.

34:57.897 --> 34:59.864
Fortune, fame.

34:59.866 --> 35:02.299
But nothing satisfied.

35:03.903 --> 35:05.703
"To thine own self be true."

Polonius.

35:14.080 --> 35:15.379
(drawer opens)

35:20.887 --> 35:23.354
I'll show you what
you've been dreaming of.

35:27.727 --> 35:28.993
MISS EVERS:
Yes, sir?

35:30.163 --> 35:32.163
Stop your sniveling.

35:32.165 --> 35:34.398
I found this one
in the bar, sir.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.333
Prostituting herself.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.903
Ah.
There's nothing
she won't do for a dollar.

35:38.905 --> 35:41.806
Sorry, man,
bondage really bores me.

35:41.808 --> 35:44.241
Me, too.

35:44.844 --> 35:45.943
Pull the trigger

35:45.945 --> 35:47.578
and take her last breath.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.280
(whimpering)

35:49.282 --> 35:50.915
It's exhilarating.

35:50.917 --> 35:52.016
You're crazy.

35:54.086 --> 35:54.952
Get off me, man.

35:54.954 --> 35:56.821
(grunting)

36:02.695 --> 36:04.094
Well...

36:04.096 --> 36:05.763
No!

36:07.767 --> 36:11.202
You got to go out and grab life.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.671
Oh! Jesus!

36:14.807 --> 36:17.508
Laundress?
Yes, sir?

36:17.510 --> 36:18.609
Replace the linens.

36:18.611 --> 36:19.810
Right away, sir.

36:19.812 --> 36:20.778
I'll get the ammonia.

36:20.780 --> 36:23.214
What a glorious stain!

What took you so long?

38:25.071 --> 38:28.005
You know who I am?

38:28.007 --> 38:31.175
Scarlett.

38:46.292 --> 38:47.591
Do you remember them?

38:47.593 --> 38:49.093
That's Mom.

38:49.095 --> 38:50.361
Dad.

38:50.363 --> 38:52.696
And that's me
and that's you.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.765
But you're different now.

38:58.037 --> 39:00.337
I grew up.

39:00.339 --> 39:03.173
Why haven't you?

39:07.947 --> 39:10.547
Mom and Dad are gonna be
so happy when they see you.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.616
They think you're dead.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.886
Let's go home now.

39:17.156 --> 39:18.956
I am home.

39:18.958 --> 39:21.058
I like it here.

39:21.961 --> 39:23.293
You can come

39:23.295 --> 39:25.362
to visit whenever you want.

39:31.971 --> 39:34.038
Can I take a picture?

39:40.346 --> 39:42.079
Okay, here we go.

39:53.159 --> 39:55.225

If you could just ask Wendy

41:00.493 --> 41:03.160
if she can think of anything,

anything she may have said

JOHN: Why can't I patch in
to the cameras downtown

41:08.067 --> 41:09.633
from my laptop here at home?

41:09.635 --> 41:11.301
But she's been gone
for five hours!

41:11.303 --> 41:13.504
It's a long time when a psycho
has your private number!

41:13.506 --> 41:15.506
Daddy?

41:18.110 --> 41:19.243
Oh, my God.

41:26.118 --> 41:27.818
Where have you been?

41:27.820 --> 41:29.119
Are you okay?

41:29.121 --> 41:30.254
Are you hurt?

41:30.256 --> 41:31.755
Did somebody take you?

41:31.757 --> 41:33.123
I went on the bus.

41:33.125 --> 41:34.258
To your hotel.

41:34.260 --> 41:36.193
Alone?

41:36.195 --> 41:37.661
Yes.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.263
Jesus Christ, Scarlett.

41:39.265 --> 41:41.198
Jesus Christ,
you can't do that to us!

41:41.200 --> 41:42.833
I'm sorry, Mommy.

41:42.835 --> 41:44.501
How did this happen?

41:44.503 --> 41:46.103
Mom, I pretended
to go to the bathroom

41:46.105 --> 41:48.939
and then climbed
out the window.

41:48.941 --> 41:51.341
I know the police guy
couldn't go in there.

41:52.845 --> 41:54.478
I wanted to see
if it was really him.

41:54.480 --> 41:55.712
I wanted to surprise you.

41:55.714 --> 41:56.980
What are you
talking about?

41:56.982 --> 42:00.717
You wanted to see who, Scar?

42:00.719 --> 42:02.186
Holden.

42:02.188 --> 42:03.253
He's at your hotel.

42:07.459 --> 42:10.961
H-Holden is dead, Scarlett.

42:10.963 --> 42:12.462
No.

42:12.464 --> 42:13.463
I saw him.

42:13.465 --> 42:14.731
I was just talking with him.

42:14.733 --> 42:16.333
No, you weren't!

42:16.335 --> 42:18.468
He's dead, and he's never
coming back, all right?

42:18.470 --> 42:20.537
So stop saying that!

42:20.539 --> 42:22.206
I'm not a liar.

42:23.542 --> 42:24.975
I took a picture.

42:24.977 --> 42:26.743
I saw him, and
he was real,

42:26.745 --> 42:28.212
and you lied to me.
No.

42:28.214 --> 42:30.080
You said he was dead,
but I saw him.

42:34.520 --> 42:36.587
(door slams)

42:39.191 --> 42:42.192
Jesus Christ, I can't
believe you made me

42:42.194 --> 42:43.493
go through this again.

42:43.495 --> 42:45.095
You think Holden
was my fault?

42:47.533 --> 42:49.533
I'm sorry, I'm very tired.

42:49.535 --> 42:51.602
I'm going to bed.

43:11.523 --> 43:13.523
TRISTAN:
<i> Jesus Christ.</i>

43:13.525 --> 43:15.359
<i> I look amazing.</i>

43:18.731 --> 43:21.531
I would do me.

43:21.533 --> 43:24.034
No zits, no blackheads.

43:24.036 --> 43:25.302
Mmm.

43:25.304 --> 43:28.605
All that crystal
was wrecking my skin,

43:28.607 --> 43:30.407
making me look like
something on that Web site,

43:30.409 --> 43:32.943
"Faces of Meth."

43:32.945 --> 43:37.047
Now I look, what, like,
(smacks lips) 24.

43:37.049 --> 43:39.416
Goddamn.
(Countess laughs)

43:39.418 --> 43:43.253
The beauty of the virus
is you never age.

43:43.255 --> 43:47.257
You now have a supercharged
immune system.

43:47.259 --> 43:49.593
Can a bullet
take me out?

43:49.595 --> 43:51.662
A silver bullet or a stake?

43:51.664 --> 43:53.964
Bitch, please,
of course it can.

43:55.768 --> 43:58.769
You're only immortal
if you're smart.

43:58.771 --> 44:01.305
(both chuckle)

44:22.127 --> 44:23.427
TRISTAN:
No fangs?

44:23.429 --> 44:25.295
We don't bite.

44:25.297 --> 44:26.596
We cut.

44:26.598 --> 44:28.298
Harder, harder.

44:28.300 --> 44:29.533
Harder.

44:32.838 --> 44:34.871
(Countess moans sensually)

44:34.873 --> 44:37.741
COUNTESS: Never
drink from the dead

44:39.311 --> 44:43.113
Avoid the diseased, the
feeble, the polluted.

44:43.115 --> 44:45.382
Bad blood is like a...

44:45.384 --> 44:47.884
a bad flu or worse.

44:47.886 --> 44:50.153
Coffins?

44:50.155 --> 44:53.357
I prefer blackout curtains
and a Duxiana bed.

44:53.359 --> 44:56.326
The sun won't kill you,

44:56.328 --> 44:58.695
but it should be avoided.

44:58.697 --> 45:01.231
It will sap
your vitality.

45:01.233 --> 45:02.799
Huh.

45:05.337 --> 45:07.871
<i> Bellissimo.</i>

45:07.873 --> 45:09.973
What?

45:11.977 --> 45:15.445
Nothing, you just remind
me so much of someone.

45:17.483 --> 45:19.483
You know what I
can't wait for?

45:19.485 --> 45:21.985
To hunt Kendall Jenner.

45:21.987 --> 45:24.354
Bitch blew me off
once at Coachella.

45:24.356 --> 45:26.356
Can I kill her?

45:26.358 --> 45:29.359
The only thing
that can undo you now

45:29.361 --> 45:31.728
is your own recklessness.

45:31.730 --> 45:36.266
Just don't get caught.

45:36.268 --> 45:40.437
And don't fall in love.

45:43.509 --> 45:45.575
That's the part
you save for me.

45:50.282 --> 45:53.283
Forever.

45:53.285 --> 45:55.552
TRISTAN:
How old are you?

45:55.554 --> 45:59.556
COUNTESS:
I was born in 1904.

45:59.558 --> 46:01.358
(Tristan laughs)

46:01.360 --> 46:03.360
TRISTAN:
Who turned you?

46:03.362 --> 46:08.198
COUNTESS: One who is even
more beautiful than you.

46:08.200 --> 46:10.267
But he's long gone now.

46:12.971 --> 46:15.539
So you'll have to do.

46:15.541 --> 46:16.540
(chuckles)

46:16.542 --> 46:18.308
(chuckles)
Shit.

46:18.310 --> 46:21.578
So you lived through, like,
the wars and the depression

46:21.580 --> 46:24.448
and... Clinton
and everything.

46:26.385 --> 46:28.452
What was your
favorite time?

46:31.423 --> 46:35.725
Every decade has its
decadence period.

46:35.727 --> 46:37.794
That's when I'm most alive.

46:40.065 --> 46:43.600
I loved the late
1970s the most.

46:43.602 --> 46:46.436
¶ I want your love ¶

46:46.438 --> 46:48.472
¶ I want... ¶

46:48.474 --> 46:49.840
¶ Your love ¶

46:52.744 --> 46:54.744
¶ I want your love ¶

46:54.746 --> 46:56.079
¶ I want ¶

46:56.081 --> 46:57.147
¶ Your love ¶

46:59.785 --> 47:01.751
COUNTESS:
<i> I was the disco queen.</i>

47:01.753 --> 47:03.253
¶ I want your love ¶

47:03.255 --> 47:04.521
¶ I want ¶

47:04.523 --> 47:05.822
¶ Your love ¶

47:05.824 --> 47:08.358
<i> I still am.</i>

47:10.095 --> 47:12.095
<i> The darkness was the light.</i>

47:12.097 --> 47:14.097
<i> I could walk amongst them</i>

47:14.099 --> 47:18.101
<i> with no fear, no judgment.</i>

47:18.103 --> 47:20.170
<i> We were all vampires then.</i>

47:23.108 --> 47:25.008
<i> Oh, my God.</i>

47:25.010 --> 47:26.776
¶ I want your love ¶

47:26.778 --> 47:29.546
¶ I need your love ¶

47:29.548 --> 47:32.883
¶ Just like the birds
the sky above. ¶

47:34.853 --> 47:36.920
I mourn it still.

47:39.224 --> 47:43.026
I think about everything
that could have been,

47:43.028 --> 47:45.896
had they all
lived, my friends.

47:48.400 --> 47:50.734
Andy, Keith.

47:53.205 --> 47:55.272
Robert.

47:58.410 --> 48:01.912
All that... loss.

48:01.914 --> 48:04.481
Were those guys
you killed?

48:04.483 --> 48:06.216
(footsteps approach)

48:06.218 --> 48:07.951
He won't last a week.

48:10.689 --> 48:11.922
You want to say
that to my face?

48:11.924 --> 48:14.090
I just did.

48:14.092 --> 48:16.126
Tristan, would you give
us a minute?

48:18.931 --> 48:20.997
Yeah, sure.

48:45.691 --> 48:47.991
(Donovan laughs)

48:49.528 --> 48:52.629
I can't believe you turned him.

48:54.533 --> 48:57.601
He's a stupid trashy model.

48:57.603 --> 49:01.972
And you were a pathetic addict
dying on a filthy floor.

49:08.981 --> 49:10.780
I didn't want
to hurt you.

49:10.782 --> 49:13.783
I still don't.

49:13.785 --> 49:17.621
There's no reason
this has to end badly.

49:18.590 --> 49:19.823
End?

49:22.094 --> 49:24.227
Are you throwing me out?

49:32.004 --> 49:34.237
I love you.

49:39.411 --> 49:41.478
I love you.

49:43.448 --> 49:45.448
And I love you.

49:45.450 --> 49:47.984
But you will learn--

49:47.986 --> 49:51.421
it isn't our precious
virus that makes you.

49:51.423 --> 49:55.425
It isn't who you kill

49:55.427 --> 49:57.427
or who you screw.

49:57.429 --> 50:00.697
It's the heartbreaks.

50:00.699 --> 50:03.767
The bigger, the better.

50:08.707 --> 50:12.275
I know better than any of us.

50:16.214 --> 50:18.848
I'll let you pack
your things.

50:28.393 --> 50:30.493
(glass shatters)
You said,

50:30.495 --> 50:33.830
when you brought me back
from the brink of death,

50:33.832 --> 50:35.632
that it was the closest
thing you ever had

50:35.634 --> 50:37.167
to a spiritual experience.
You tell me...

50:37.169 --> 50:39.969
you tell me you felt that
when you made him.

50:39.971 --> 50:41.638
Honestly...

50:41.640 --> 50:42.839
<i> it was...</i>

50:42.841 --> 50:45.041
<i> one of the most...</i>

50:45.043 --> 50:46.976
<i> erotic...</i>

50:46.978 --> 50:48.978
<i> moments...</i>

50:48.980 --> 50:51.881
<i> of my life.</i>

51:15.774 --> 51:18.942
¶ ¶

51:26.118 --> 51:27.117
Hey there,
handsome.

51:27.119 --> 51:28.718
Rough day?

51:28.720 --> 51:31.054
Oh, cowboy, we don't
allow guests back here.

51:31.056 --> 51:33.890
Don't think of me as a guest,
think of me as the angry father

51:33.892 --> 51:36.426
whose daughter you let
roam these halls today.

51:36.428 --> 51:37.927
There's not a thing
that goes on in this place

51:37.929 --> 51:39.696
that you don't know about,
which makes you an accessory.

51:39.698 --> 51:41.564
To what?

51:41.566 --> 51:43.566
Murder, maybe
kidnapping.

51:43.568 --> 51:45.368
I'm done playing.

51:45.370 --> 51:47.203
Aren't you gonna
frisk me first?

51:48.240 --> 51:50.740
Whew, it's been a long time

51:50.742 --> 51:52.742
since a man spun me
around like that.

51:52.744 --> 51:55.745
If I was a few years younger,
I'd even enjoy the cuffs.

51:55.747 --> 51:57.280
Oh, you're not
gonna enjoy this,

51:57.282 --> 51:58.715
believe me, until you
start telling me

51:58.717 --> 52:00.316
everything that's
going on in this place.

52:04.322 --> 52:06.122
You've seen things.

52:06.124 --> 52:07.891
You know I have.

52:07.893 --> 52:10.560
Look, before you have
to explain to somebody

52:10.562 --> 52:12.562
what you think you're
charging me with,

52:12.564 --> 52:14.831
why don't you take
these bracelets off of me?

52:14.833 --> 52:17.133
I'll tell you
what you want to know.

52:25.610 --> 52:27.677
(sighs)

52:29.681 --> 52:31.748
There's just one
thing you got to do.

52:31.750 --> 52:32.782
What?

52:32.784 --> 52:34.684
Ask nice.

52:34.686 --> 52:36.753
And buy a lady
a drink.

52:59.177 --> 53:00.710
Is that your thing?

53:00.712 --> 53:02.078
You need to be talked
into drinking?

53:08.987 --> 53:11.354
Cut the crap, ask me
what you really want to know.

53:11.356 --> 53:14.791
I want to know what's
going on in this place.

53:18.029 --> 53:20.830
Well, if you want to know
what this place is about,

53:20.832 --> 53:23.366
you have to know
about the man who built it--

53:23.368 --> 53:25.435
James Patrick March.

53:27.873 --> 53:32.675
<i> He put atom of evil in his</i>
<i>being into building this hotel.</i>

53:32.677 --> 53:35.678
<i> March was a self-made</i>
<i> man-- oil, coal.</i>

53:35.680 --> 53:37.480
<i> But he was new money,</i>

53:37.482 --> 53:40.250
<i> shunned by the elites</i>
<i> of East Coast society.</i>

53:40.252 --> 53:43.253
<i> So he came west, to a land</i>
<i> where pedigree meant little</i>

53:43.255 --> 53:45.054
<i> if you had a lot of dough.</i>

53:45.056 --> 53:48.591
<i> Here he would build a monument</i>
<i> to excess and opulence,</i>

53:48.593 --> 53:51.594
<i> where he could satisfy</i>
<i> his own peculiar appetites.</i>

53:51.596 --> 53:53.396
Uh, Mr. March?

53:53.398 --> 53:55.198
Mr. March?!

53:55.200 --> 53:57.433
Uh, th-there's a problem.

53:57.435 --> 53:59.502
I'll be right down!

54:06.177 --> 54:08.845
IRIS:<i> He was a design freak--</i>
<i> art deco, self-taught.</i>

54:08.847 --> 54:10.847
<i> He tried to get Julia Morgan</i>

54:10.849 --> 54:13.016
<i> to come out and build</i>
<i> a place for him,</i>

54:13.018 --> 54:15.518
<i> but she demanded that he pay</i>
<i> his workers fair wages,</i>

54:15.520 --> 54:17.520
<i> so he told her to stuff it.</i>

54:17.522 --> 54:19.522
There's a part of these plans
that make no sense.

54:19.524 --> 54:22.592
I mean, entire hallways
with no rooms off of them.

54:25.430 --> 54:27.931
It looks like you
want us to build,

54:27.933 --> 54:31.134
uh, some sort of
secret passage system.

54:32.871 --> 54:35.038
Well, of course
these make no sense.

54:35.040 --> 54:37.040
These aren't
the right ones.

54:37.042 --> 54:38.875
You're working
off an old draft.

54:38.877 --> 54:40.410
Come up to my
office with me.

54:40.412 --> 54:41.911
I'll get you the new set.
(sighs in relief)

54:41.913 --> 54:43.980
Okay, good.
(chuckles)

54:49.921 --> 54:52.288
MARCH:
I envy you.

54:54.259 --> 54:57.327
My curse was making
my fortune too early.

55:15.747 --> 55:18.748
My point being that the
appetites of the filthy rich

55:18.750 --> 55:20.116
are specific.

55:20.118 --> 55:23.119
Altered from that
of the common man.

55:23.121 --> 55:25.188
Do you mind?

55:26.691 --> 55:30.126
I feed some of that hunger
with this building.

55:30.128 --> 55:32.996
(clicks)

55:32.998 --> 55:35.798
My art.

55:35.800 --> 55:39.802
But sometimes,
if I really want

55:39.804 --> 55:42.739
that good, full feeling...

56:00.158 --> 56:03.159
IRIS:
<i> He wasn't just building</i>
<i> the finest hotel</i>

56:03.161 --> 56:04.327
<i> Los Angeles had ever seen.</i>

56:04.329 --> 56:05.828
(groans)

56:05.830 --> 56:08.031
<i> It was a perfectly designed</i>
<i> torture chamber.</i>

56:09.000 --> 56:12.001
<i> An engineered alibi.</i>

56:12.003 --> 56:14.404
<i> Secret chutes and rooms</i>

56:14.406 --> 56:16.372
<i> to hide and dispose</i>
<i> of the bodies.</i>

56:17.509 --> 56:20.410
<i> Hallways with no exits.</i>

56:20.412 --> 56:22.311
(screaming)

56:22.313 --> 56:25.815
<i> Walls were lined with asbestos</i>

56:25.817 --> 56:28.084
<i>so they could mute the screams.</i>

56:28.086 --> 56:29.719
<i> People walked in,</i>

56:29.721 --> 56:31.854
<i> just vanished.</i>

56:31.856 --> 56:33.990
<i> "No body, no crime,"</i>
<i> he would say.</i>

56:33.992 --> 56:38.861
(whistling)
No, no.

56:38.863 --> 56:40.029
(crying):
I don't like small spaces.

56:40.031 --> 56:41.030
Please.

56:41.032 --> 56:43.199
Help!

56:43.201 --> 56:44.667
(sighs)

56:44.669 --> 56:45.935
Somebody help!

56:45.937 --> 56:47.336
Help!

56:47.338 --> 56:49.172
Help! Help!

56:49.174 --> 56:51.040
No.

56:51.042 --> 56:52.842
Please, no.

56:55.780 --> 56:57.346
IRIS:
<i> He had a wife.</i>

56:57.348 --> 56:58.748
No.

56:58.750 --> 57:00.683
<i> They say he forced her</i>
<i> to watch the torture.</i>

57:00.685 --> 57:02.418
I like it.

57:02.420 --> 57:04.187
Help. No, please.

57:04.189 --> 57:06.055
No, help!

57:06.057 --> 57:08.024
IRIS:
<i> No one knows how many died.</i>

57:08.026 --> 57:11.227
<i> Rumor has it</i>
<i> he averaged three a week.</i>

57:11.229 --> 57:14.063
<i> A lot more if he went</i>
<i> on a bender.</i>

57:14.065 --> 57:16.065
Help!

57:16.067 --> 57:18.101
(screaming)

57:24.809 --> 57:26.142
(groaning)

57:31.916 --> 57:34.484
(panting)

57:40.225 --> 57:41.524
(groans)

57:43.995 --> 57:46.062
Miss Evers!

57:46.064 --> 57:48.231
Yes, Mr. March?

57:48.233 --> 57:50.166
Do you require fresh linens?

57:50.168 --> 57:51.434
Yes.

57:51.436 --> 57:54.170
But more importantly,

57:54.172 --> 57:55.471
remind me to switch out

57:55.473 --> 57:58.241
this God-awful Secessionist
light fixture.

57:58.243 --> 57:59.642
Makes this place

57:59.644 --> 58:01.711
look like a damn zoo.

58:03.248 --> 58:05.681
(groans)

58:06.851 --> 58:09.886
Excuse my language.

58:11.089 --> 58:12.088
(chuckles)

58:12.090 --> 58:14.690
IRIS:
<i> His loyal minion.</i>

58:14.692 --> 58:17.026
<i> Miss Evers, the laundress.</i>

58:19.297 --> 58:22.498
<i> She said she could get a stain</i>
<i> out of anything for Mr. March</i>

58:22.500 --> 58:25.268
<i> using a secret ingredient--</i>

58:25.270 --> 58:28.171
<i> love.</i>

58:33.845 --> 58:35.411
(groans)

58:48.126 --> 58:50.193
(praying softly)

58:52.997 --> 58:55.064
My father was a true believer.

58:56.668 --> 59:00.002
Ate the little cracker
and drank the wine every Sunday.

59:00.004 --> 59:02.004
(inhales sharply)

59:02.006 --> 59:05.241
And he was the meanest
son of a bitch you've ever seen.

59:06.811 --> 59:09.912
Kill a cat for purring too loud.

59:09.914 --> 59:12.548
(clicking tongue)

59:12.550 --> 59:16.185
You want me to tell you
the worst thing in this world?

59:16.187 --> 59:18.254
Religion.

59:19.924 --> 59:22.225
That and regulations.

59:22.227 --> 59:25.661
God is in my heart so I
know there is always hope.

59:32.537 --> 59:34.670
You think there
is hope now?

59:37.208 --> 59:40.509
You think God is
going to protect you

59:40.511 --> 59:43.279
from the head
of this hammer?

59:45.516 --> 59:48.851
Or the six floors
you're about to fall?

59:48.853 --> 59:51.187
As long as there is a God,

59:51.189 --> 59:55.124
men like you can kill thousands,

59:55.126 --> 59:57.560
millions,

59:57.562 --> 1:00:00.663
but you will never find peace.

1:00:03.268 --> 1:00:06.369
(laughs)

1:00:06.371 --> 1:00:09.372
Well then,

1:00:09.374 --> 1:00:11.807
I guess I'm just going
to have to kill God.

1:00:14.045 --> 1:00:17.113
That is my message
to the world.

1:00:29.427 --> 1:00:31.060
(groans)

1:00:31.062 --> 1:00:34.297
Fly!

1:00:34.299 --> 1:00:36.499
I'll fetch you a clean shirt.

1:00:41.839 --> 1:00:43.639
And I want every Bible

1:00:43.641 --> 1:00:47.343
from every bed stand
in this entire hotel!

1:01:05.330 --> 1:01:08.364
(insects buzzing)

1:01:08.366 --> 1:01:11.634
DETECTIVE:
What in the Hell is this mess?

1:01:11.636 --> 1:01:15.004
No I.D.'s.

1:01:15.006 --> 1:01:17.373
(sighs)

1:01:20.611 --> 1:01:21.711
DETECTIVE:
Not right

1:01:21.713 --> 1:01:23.612
for someone

1:01:23.614 --> 1:01:25.681
to pull this shit
on a Sunday.

1:01:33.958 --> 1:01:36.792
IRIS:
<i>He was sloppy with his wet work</i>
<i> out in the world.</i>

1:01:38.363 --> 1:01:40.496
<i> They say somebody</i>
<i> turned him in.</i>

1:01:40.498 --> 1:01:41.864
<i> No one knows who,</i>

1:01:41.866 --> 1:01:44.633
<i> but I'm betting on the wife.</i>

1:01:44.635 --> 1:01:47.403
<i> With him gone,</i>
<i> she got everything.</i>

1:01:47.405 --> 1:01:50.806
<i> All those millions.</i>

1:01:54.645 --> 1:01:57.580
(knocking)

1:01:59.851 --> 1:02:01.317
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.

1:02:01.319 --> 1:02:03.652
I have some very bad news.

1:02:03.654 --> 1:02:05.421
The police are here.

1:02:29.180 --> 1:02:31.247
(sighs heavily)

1:02:58.943 --> 1:03:01.811
Oh, Miss Evers.

1:03:01.813 --> 1:03:05.381
You have always been
the only one I can count on.

1:03:05.383 --> 1:03:07.483
You are a pillar.

1:03:07.485 --> 1:03:10.052
And so I give you the honors.

1:03:11.255 --> 1:03:13.322
What order shall we die in?

1:03:14.425 --> 1:03:16.592
Oh, Mr. March.

1:03:16.594 --> 1:03:18.461
(sighs)

1:03:18.463 --> 1:03:19.995
Oh, I really don't know.

1:03:19.997 --> 1:03:22.131
I mean, part of me wishes
you would go first

1:03:22.133 --> 1:03:24.066
so I could launder the sheets.

1:03:24.068 --> 1:03:25.734
There's no time for that,
is there?

1:03:25.736 --> 1:03:28.404
(knocking)

1:03:28.406 --> 1:03:30.172
No.

1:03:30.174 --> 1:03:32.775
It seems not.

1:03:32.777 --> 1:03:34.743
I will go first.

1:03:34.745 --> 1:03:37.413
(knocking continues)

1:03:40.651 --> 1:03:42.418
Gun, please.

1:03:49.660 --> 1:03:51.460
(gasps)

1:03:51.462 --> 1:03:53.262
Would you do me the honor

1:03:53.264 --> 1:03:54.630
of making me your last one?

1:03:54.632 --> 1:03:57.099
Your last meal?

1:03:57.101 --> 1:03:58.801
(knocking continues)

1:03:58.803 --> 1:04:00.870
Miss Evers.

1:04:03.774 --> 1:04:06.275
(gun clicks)

1:04:07.311 --> 1:04:08.544
(chuckles)

1:04:15.219 --> 1:04:17.286
(knocking continues)

1:04:21.559 --> 1:04:23.259
(choking)

1:04:45.483 --> 1:04:47.416
You're in the wrong profession.

1:04:47.418 --> 1:04:49.652
You should be writing
for the movies.

1:04:49.654 --> 1:04:51.654
Ain't a movie.

1:04:51.656 --> 1:04:53.522
This place is the real deal.

1:04:53.524 --> 1:04:55.824
If you want to know
what's really going on here,

1:04:55.826 --> 1:04:58.527
you're gonna have
to expand your thinking a bit.

1:04:58.529 --> 1:05:01.530
Well, I've worked
every kind of crime--

1:05:01.532 --> 1:05:04.033
robbery, homicide, assault.

1:05:04.035 --> 1:05:05.601
Not one of them
were committed

1:05:05.603 --> 1:05:08.070
by a ghoul or a ghost.

1:05:08.072 --> 1:05:10.673
People do enough damage

1:05:10.675 --> 1:05:12.641
without help from the afterlife.

1:05:16.681 --> 1:05:18.881
Put it on her tab.

1:05:18.883 --> 1:05:20.716
That was his office.

1:05:20.718 --> 1:05:22.718
The room you're staying in,

1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:24.587
64.

1:05:24.589 --> 1:05:26.188
If this building has a heart,

1:05:26.190 --> 1:05:29.291
it's black as the ace of spades,

1:05:29.293 --> 1:05:30.759
(chuckles)
and you're sleeping in it.

1:06:01.158 --> 1:06:04.159
HAHN: Got the lab results
on that bloody award.

1:06:04.161 --> 1:06:06.762
It's what you thought--
DNA matches our first vic.

1:06:06.764 --> 1:06:09.732
Martin Gamboa,
our blogger.

1:06:09.734 --> 1:06:13.502
Wrote for that
site Gold Derby.

1:06:13.504 --> 1:06:15.004
Now we've got
a murder weapon.

1:06:15.006 --> 1:06:18.374
Yeah, and maybe a motive.

1:06:19.577 --> 1:06:20.976
What's this?

1:06:20.978 --> 1:06:23.312
You ever hear
of James Patrick March?

1:06:24.515 --> 1:06:25.948
Oilman.

1:06:25.950 --> 1:06:27.583
No.

1:06:27.585 --> 1:06:28.817
He made a killing
during the Great Depression.

1:06:28.819 --> 1:06:30.786
Built a hotel here.

1:06:30.788 --> 1:06:32.655
Might have been a serial killer.

1:06:32.657 --> 1:06:33.822
Before he topped himself,

1:06:33.824 --> 1:06:35.424
the police were trying
to connect him

1:06:35.426 --> 1:06:36.625
to a bunch of unsolved murders.

1:06:36.627 --> 1:06:38.360
They couldn't do it,

1:06:38.362 --> 1:06:39.695
but I think somebody else did.

1:06:39.697 --> 1:06:40.829
What are you talking about?

1:06:40.831 --> 1:06:43.999
It's a pattern, Andy.

1:06:44.001 --> 1:06:45.467
A pattern?
Yeah.

1:06:45.469 --> 1:06:46.635
Dead thief, cut off his hands.

1:06:46.637 --> 1:06:48.637
Thou Shalt Not Steal.

1:06:48.639 --> 1:06:49.705
Illegals, looking for work

1:06:49.707 --> 1:06:51.040
on a Sunday.

1:06:51.042 --> 1:06:53.208
Remember the Sabbath
to keep it holy.

1:06:53.210 --> 1:06:54.376
Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery.

1:06:54.378 --> 1:06:56.679
Thou Shalt Not Worship
False Idols.

1:06:56.681 --> 1:06:57.613
And the Rylance Twins.

1:06:57.615 --> 1:06:59.348
Most people thought

1:06:59.350 --> 1:07:00.783
their parents' boating
accident was an accident.

1:07:00.785 --> 1:07:02.818
But maybe our killer
knew better.

1:07:02.820 --> 1:07:05.487
Maybe-maybe the rumors
were true--

1:07:05.489 --> 1:07:07.156
they offed Mommy and Daddy.

1:07:07.158 --> 1:07:09.224
Honor Thy Mother And Father.

1:07:12.697 --> 1:07:14.463
The Ten Commandments?

1:07:14.465 --> 1:07:16.398
You're saying
someone's picked up

1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:18.867
where this-this
March guy left off?

1:07:18.869 --> 1:07:20.803
Maybe.

1:07:20.805 --> 1:07:22.137
I don't know, John.

1:07:23.374 --> 1:07:25.374
Holy shit.

1:07:25.376 --> 1:07:27.476
The hotel he built--

1:07:27.478 --> 1:07:30.012
that's where
you're living now.

1:07:30.014 --> 1:07:32.081
Yes.

(chuckles)
Look, dude,

1:09:13.484 --> 1:09:15.117
you're hot, but vag action

1:09:15.119 --> 1:09:16.585
is a total deal breaker for me.
