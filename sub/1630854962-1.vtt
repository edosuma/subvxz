00:26.635 --> 00:27.636
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

00:27.766 --> 00:28.550
Where do you think you're going?

00:31.466 --> 00:32.467
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

00:32.554 --> 00:34.382
- No!
- Get up!

00:34.512 --> 00:37.124
I don't wanna do it anymore!
Please--

00:48.439 --> 00:50.137
Please don't make me.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.269
Please don't make me.

00:52.356 --> 00:53.879
Please...

01:12.985 --> 01:15.727
Mm!

01:19.340 --> 01:21.994
Hey, I'm glad you
guys could make it.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.908
You enjoying yourselves?

01:24.039 --> 01:27.521
It's plenty more
where that came from.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.393
Who's winning?

01:29.524 --> 01:30.786
What do you mean
who's winning?

01:30.916 --> 01:32.744
Brian and I got this on lock!

01:32.831 --> 01:34.398
Three games in a row!

01:34.485 --> 01:35.834
Renee, God don't
like no braggart.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.271
You know what?

01:37.401 --> 01:39.011
If God was this
as good at Spades,

01:39.142 --> 01:40.274
he'd brag too.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.494
Well, we need to
switch it up after this.

01:43.625 --> 01:44.930
Tired of getting
your butt whipped?

01:45.017 --> 01:46.149
Tired of seeing your ugly face.

01:51.023 --> 01:52.676
What, is it happening again?

01:52.808 --> 01:54.462
A couple of times a day.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.942
I told you to go see
somebody about that.

01:57.073 --> 02:00.511
Mm, I ain't got no time to be
waitin' all day in urgent care.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.731
Just a couple of aspirin,
and I'll be good as new.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.254
Hey!

02:04.341 --> 02:06.082
Hey, enjoynig
your birthday, baby?

02:06.213 --> 02:08.084
-It's the best one ever.
-Yeah?

02:08.215 --> 02:10.086
You guys go wash your hands.
We're gonna cut the cake soon.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.218
Yeah?

02:11.348 --> 02:13.133
Mmkay. Mmkay.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.315
Mia?

02:22.838 --> 02:24.056
What?

02:24.187 --> 02:26.233
No, that's not nece--

02:26.320 --> 02:28.235
Mm, mm.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.019
Okay.

02:30.106 --> 02:33.022
Huh, yeah.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.284
Bye.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.508
Who told her?

02:42.727 --> 02:43.815
Why?

02:43.902 --> 02:45.600
She's her aunt!

02:45.730 --> 02:48.864
She's not welcome here,
and you know that.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.213
I told you.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.084
You knew?

02:52.215 --> 02:54.391
I don't understand why
you guys hate her so much.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.437
You didn't have to
grow up with her.

02:56.524 --> 02:59.483
It's not my fault Grandma didn't
have enough room for all of us.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.529
I just don't understand
why you guys hate her so much.

03:04.793 --> 03:07.709
Yes, she did kill a person.

03:07.796 --> 03:10.146
But he was beating on Venus.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.192
I don't condone
what she did, but...

03:12.322 --> 03:13.976
I'm not gonna
hold it against her.

03:14.106 --> 03:15.717
That is not it.
Mia Ann is--

03:20.852 --> 03:22.376
She's here.

03:25.422 --> 03:27.294
What did I do?

03:27.424 --> 03:28.904
Just play.

03:32.995 --> 03:34.866
You got a lot of
nerve showing up here.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.607
Don't talk to my mom like that.

03:36.694 --> 03:38.087
Uh, it's okay, baby.

03:38.174 --> 03:40.524
Just go get the
things out the back.

03:40.611 --> 03:43.788
Why so much venom to
someone bearing gifts?

03:43.918 --> 03:46.313
I told you, I don't
need anything from you.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.663
Oh, all of a sudden?

03:48.793 --> 03:51.361
Because when your heat was off
and your funds was low,

03:51.492 --> 03:53.320
my money was good
enough for you then.

03:53.406 --> 03:55.147
That's because it
involved Cameron.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.498
Didn't want her freezing.

03:57.585 --> 04:00.501
And just like then, I'm
here for Cameron again.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.938
Where should I put this?

04:03.025 --> 04:04.548
Back in the truck,
'cause you're not staying.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.898
Oh!

04:06.985 --> 04:10.467
I see you invited the others.

04:10.554 --> 04:11.599
They're her family.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.253
I'm her family.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.124
I love her too.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.257
I mean, nobody's
perfect, Patricia.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.259
And you let her stay with Renee,

04:19.346 --> 04:21.608
and she got a different man
at her house every week!

04:21.696 --> 04:23.480
And Brian?

04:23.567 --> 04:26.701
He can't think his way out
a paper bag, he's so dumb.

04:26.831 --> 04:29.269
The only one who don't
give me problems is Yoyo.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.575
That's because she lived
with Grandma after Mom died.

04:31.706 --> 04:32.663
Well, you could've
moved in with her.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.796
No, I couldn't!

04:34.883 --> 04:37.668
She already had seven of us
in her two-bedroom house.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.802
The rest of us had to
stay with Venus and you.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.499
Yolanda don't know
what you forced us

04:42.630 --> 04:43.674
to do to each other.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.284
We were kids!

04:45.415 --> 04:47.852
We were stupid!
Now we gotta move on!

04:47.983 --> 04:49.463
You were
supposed to take care of us!

04:49.550 --> 04:52.596
I am not here to fight.

04:52.727 --> 04:55.991
I came here so that my niece
can have a memorable birthday.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.298
Auntie Mia?

04:58.385 --> 04:59.951
Hi, baby.

05:00.038 --> 05:01.736
Are those for me?

05:01.823 --> 05:03.303
Of course they are,

05:03.390 --> 05:05.174
and I got something
else for you too.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.220
Wow!

05:08.351 --> 05:11.441
Cam Cam, give back the money.

05:11.528 --> 05:12.790
But...

05:12.921 --> 05:14.314
Give the money back.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.011
Go play with your friends.

05:16.141 --> 05:17.839
What about my gifts?

05:17.926 --> 05:21.408
The adults are talking.
Go on, now.

05:21.538 --> 05:22.670
Yes, ma'am.

05:29.154 --> 05:32.027
Now, take your gifts and
your tired-ass daughter--

05:32.114 --> 05:33.724
Excuse me?

05:33.811 --> 05:37.772
--back to your SUV and
get the hell out of here.

05:37.859 --> 05:41.036
People change.

05:41.123 --> 05:43.081
Isn't that what you
read in your Bible?

05:43.168 --> 05:44.779
Forgiveness?

05:44.866 --> 05:46.171
God forgives.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.699
I ain't God.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.703
Patricia...

05:57.400 --> 05:59.054
I love you, sis.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.062
Come on with the damn bike.

06:13.808 --> 06:14.939
If you just gonna
sit there and be angry,

06:15.026 --> 06:16.854
you could go to your room.

06:16.941 --> 06:19.161
Why couldn't I keep the gifts?

06:19.291 --> 06:22.294
When it comes to your auntie,
things are complicated.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.471
But it was $40!

06:24.601 --> 06:27.952
Baby, not all money...

06:28.082 --> 06:29.476
is good money.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.216
I don't understand.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.176
How can I explain this?

06:37.048 --> 06:40.748
Okay, in the Bible,

06:40.878 --> 06:46.928
it says that money
is a protection.

06:47.058 --> 06:52.499
It can be used to pay for things
we need, like food and clothes.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.065
Or the doll I was gonna
buy with the money.

06:54.196 --> 06:58.896
Yes, or the doll.

06:58.983 --> 07:03.379
But sometimes, people get
money by doing bad things,

07:03.466 --> 07:05.468
by hurting others.

07:05.599 --> 07:08.297
Aunt Mia's family.
She would never hurt me.

07:09.864 --> 07:13.345
Unfortunately, sometimes
the ones that hurt us the most

07:13.433 --> 07:15.086
are family.

07:15.173 --> 07:16.784
Did she hurt you?

07:19.482 --> 07:20.527
Come here.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.445
Listen.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.969
I know you're upset about today.

07:28.099 --> 07:31.015
But I did what's best for us.

07:31.146 --> 07:34.366
And I promise, next
year, your birthday

07:34.497 --> 07:39.981
is gonna be even better
than this one, okay?

07:40.068 --> 07:43.506
Now, let's clean this up
and get ready for bed,

07:43.637 --> 07:45.334
'cause we have a lot
to be thankful for.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.643
And forgive us our debts

07:49.773 --> 07:52.384
as we have also
forgiven our debtors,

07:52.472 --> 07:54.604
and do not bring us
into temptation,

07:54.735 --> 07:56.650
but deliver us from
the wicked one.

07:56.780 --> 07:59.174
In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

07:59.304 --> 08:00.741
Amen.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.795
Mom?

08:11.926 --> 08:12.709
Yes, baby.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.755
Where's God?

08:14.842 --> 08:17.235
Mm, well...

08:17.322 --> 08:19.455
God is omnipresent.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.979
Do you know what that means?

08:23.807 --> 08:27.507
It means that he

08:27.594 --> 08:32.294
is everywhere at all times.

08:32.424 --> 08:35.515
-Even now?
-Mmhmm, yes.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.952
Even now.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.911
I bet that's pretty hard
for you to imagine, huh?

08:43.653 --> 08:46.482
Can you name something
that you can see?

08:46.613 --> 08:48.179
There's a lot of trees outside.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.094
Yes.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.444
Well, from now on,

08:52.575 --> 08:54.795
whenever you see a tree,

08:54.925 --> 08:57.275
let that be a reminder

08:57.362 --> 09:00.322
that you are never alone.

09:00.409 --> 09:01.802
God is with you.

09:01.889 --> 09:04.065
Okay?

09:04.195 --> 09:06.546
Okay.
Go to bed.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.519
What's for breakfast?

09:23.606 --> 09:25.434
Oatmeal.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.832
Do we have any sugar or butter?

09:31.962 --> 09:33.834
No, we're all out.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.400
There's syrup if you
want to sweeten it up.

09:36.663 --> 09:39.230
I know you're sick of it,

09:39.361 --> 09:42.146
but it's all we have today.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.713
And we're thankful for it.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.196
Grace!

09:50.415 --> 09:51.460
Milk...

09:52.809 --> 09:54.985
-Mama?
-Yes, baby?

09:55.116 --> 09:56.552
You can use the money
I got for my birthday

09:56.639 --> 09:58.119
to buy something
else for breakfast.

09:58.249 --> 10:01.165
Aren't you generous?

10:01.252 --> 10:03.733
Won't be necessary.

10:03.820 --> 10:04.908
Eat your meal.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.349
Mama!

10:11.480 --> 10:13.395
Mama, please, wake up!

10:13.482 --> 10:14.701
Mama!

10:14.831 --> 10:16.093
Mama, wake up!

10:16.180 --> 10:17.573
Please!

10:17.660 --> 10:18.835
Mama!

10:18.966 --> 10:20.794
Wake up!

10:20.881 --> 10:22.883
A damn aneurysm.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.711
I told her
to go see a doctor.

10:24.798 --> 10:25.929
I don't know what
we're gonna do.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.844
I'm just sayin',

10:27.931 --> 10:29.803
she's been complaining about
her head for weeks now.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.239
No one ever listens to me.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.414
Uh-huh!

10:32.501 --> 10:33.545
Yeah!

10:33.633 --> 10:35.330
No, I can take her.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.549
For sure.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.074
You missed a spot.

10:40.204 --> 10:44.121
Come on, now, Renee!
I said it's not a problem!

10:44.208 --> 10:46.863
Yeah, that's my niece,
and I will take her.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.517
Okay.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.650
O-O-Okay.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.564
Yeah, just let me
know what time.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.741
Okay, all right, baby.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.482
Okay, talk to you soon.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.180
Is it positive?

10:59.267 --> 11:01.182
I don't know.
I can't tell.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.749
Well, you got any more?

11:02.879 --> 11:04.098
That was the last one.

11:05.447 --> 11:07.710
Oh, you are such an idiot!

11:07.841 --> 11:09.494
Clean up this mess!

11:10.844 --> 11:11.714
Whatever...

11:11.845 --> 11:13.237
What you say?

11:16.676 --> 11:17.851
No, I think I heard
you say something.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.113
Didn't you hear
her say something, Chris?

11:19.243 --> 11:20.462
Yeah, I heard her say something.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.203
I just couldn't
make out what she said.

11:22.333 --> 11:25.162
I think she
done forgot who I am.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.469
But I'm sure about to
remind you.

11:27.599 --> 11:28.557
Bring her to the
kitchen, please.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.037
No, no, no.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.691
No.

11:39.915 --> 11:41.222
Are you serious?

11:41.352 --> 11:43.224
I got enough on
my plate already.

11:43.354 --> 11:45.661
Please tell me these
are not for today!

11:45.792 --> 11:48.708
They sure are!
You have an hour.

11:48.795 --> 11:49.839
What...

11:49.926 --> 11:50.797
- Hey, Gail!
- Ugh...

11:50.884 --> 11:52.537
- Gail!
- Josh...

11:52.624 --> 11:54.365
- Hey, there.
- Mmhmm...

11:54.452 --> 11:55.453
Oof!

11:55.540 --> 11:57.891
Wow, you look, uh, rough.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.588
Yeah, listen, I need a favor.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.503
Yeah, no, you're
all out of those.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.157
No, listen, listen, Gail, look.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.463
You already know I'm skating
on thin ice with Rob, right?

12:05.594 --> 12:07.683
If, if I show up to court
lookin' like this, it's a wrap.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.119
Yeah, well, you know what?

12:09.206 --> 12:10.817
While you were out
on maternity leave,

12:10.947 --> 12:12.644
I covered for you.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.385
You're back. I'm done.

12:14.516 --> 12:15.517
But these are the easy ones.

12:15.604 --> 12:16.997
I've already done
most of the work.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.172
Most of the work, huh?

12:18.259 --> 12:20.304
So easy.

12:20.435 --> 12:21.262
Fine.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.132
Thank you.

12:22.263 --> 12:23.351
Gosh!

12:23.438 --> 12:25.092
Look...

12:25.179 --> 12:28.051
All right, what we got?

12:28.182 --> 12:29.836
You reviewed Mia's profile?

12:29.923 --> 12:31.576
Yes.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.100
And done all the background
research on the case?

12:33.187 --> 12:35.537
Yes, yes, of course!

12:35.667 --> 12:37.626
All good, right?
It's so easy.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.194
Fine! Again.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.065
But you know this classifies
as a baby shower gift, right?

12:42.196 --> 12:43.501
- Noted!
- Yeah, noted.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.415
- Yes! You're the best.
- Josh, god!

12:45.503 --> 12:47.549
- Love you!
- Yeah, whatever!

12:59.822 --> 13:01.737
What are you doing here?

13:01.868 --> 13:04.784
Happy to see you awake.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.048
Good, water.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.879
You got it?

13:15.577 --> 13:16.796
I brought a present for you.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.235
Mama!

13:22.845 --> 13:24.325
How's my baby?

13:24.455 --> 13:26.022
Mm...

13:26.153 --> 13:27.328
I'm good.

13:27.458 --> 13:28.416
I miss you.

13:28.546 --> 13:29.939
I miss you too.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.769
How long I was out for?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.379
Right around three--

13:35.510 --> 13:37.773
-Days?
-Weeks.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.688
My god, I gotta get outta here.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.909
Wait a minute, now.

13:43.039 --> 13:46.173
See, the doctor said
you need to take it easy.

13:46.260 --> 13:49.002
No stress, no sudden movements.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.830
The best thing
for you is to rest.

13:53.223 --> 13:55.095
What's best for me
is that I go home

13:55.182 --> 13:56.792
and take care of my baby.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.925
Cam's all right.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.188
Gave her lunch money,
bought her some clothes,

14:01.318 --> 14:03.581
'cause that girl's
growing like a weed.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.629
Like I told you, sis,

14:07.716 --> 14:11.459
I love you,
and I love my niece.

14:11.546 --> 14:14.331
Why don't you just
let her stay with me?

14:14.418 --> 14:18.683
And I'll keep bringing her
here to visit you every day,

14:18.770 --> 14:21.295
even when you get home.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.340
And then when you're
ready and feeling better,

14:23.471 --> 14:25.952
she can come home to you.

14:28.302 --> 14:31.087
Guess you was right, huh?

14:31.174 --> 14:33.220
People can change.

14:37.006 --> 14:39.790
All right.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.620
She can stay with you...

14:42.707 --> 14:46.146
until I'm feeling better.

14:46.276 --> 14:49.453
You're doing the right thing.

14:49.584 --> 14:52.152
I'mma let y'all two
spend some time together.

14:56.286 --> 15:00.029
-Mia?
-Hm?

15:00.856 --> 15:02.423
Thank you.

15:11.084 --> 15:11.998
Hi.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.608
Josh Goodman, please?

15:16.263 --> 15:17.960
Dang, where they at?

15:18.091 --> 15:19.831
It's taking forever.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.182
Hey, give me some forks.

15:30.407 --> 15:31.974
Does this look
like a fork to you?

15:32.105 --> 15:33.976
Just stupid.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.543
Yo, Angela, you ain't gotta
do the woman like that.

15:35.673 --> 15:36.718
You know she ain't all there.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.676
Shut up.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.156
- Girl...
- Ooh!

15:40.287 --> 15:41.723
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, babe.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.638
I hope y'all got
that food going,

15:43.768 --> 15:45.814
'cause I'm starvin'!

15:45.945 --> 15:46.858
Hey, little Cameron.
How you doin'?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.512
Hi.

15:48.599 --> 15:51.124
You remember your
uncle Chris, don't ya?

15:51.211 --> 15:53.517
Huh, it's okay.

15:53.604 --> 15:56.129
I don't come around the family
as much as I'd like to.

15:56.216 --> 15:58.305
That's because my
mama won't let you.

15:58.435 --> 15:59.697
Why don't you make
yourself useful

15:59.828 --> 16:02.135
and go take care of that
crying baby of yours?

16:02.222 --> 16:03.527
How about that?

16:06.704 --> 16:08.968
Cameron, your aunt and I,
we got you a gift.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.797
Are you sure I can have it?

16:12.928 --> 16:15.104
Of course you can have it,

16:15.235 --> 16:18.238
because your auntie Mia
is taking care of you now.

16:20.327 --> 16:23.373
-She's beautiful!
-Just like you.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.767
I'm gonna call her Hannah,
like the woman in the Bible.

16:25.854 --> 16:28.639
Mm!

16:28.726 --> 16:31.120
That's Nancy.
She's the maid.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.079
You got a maid?

16:33.209 --> 16:34.515
Of course I do!

16:34.645 --> 16:36.691
All boss ladies do.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.261
What
happened to your arm?

16:41.348 --> 16:45.308
She burned it on some
hot grease cookin' chicken.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.789
Nancy, would you take
Cameron to her room, please?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.151
Thank you.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.255
Down there?

17:19.342 --> 17:21.910
Yup! You'll be fine.
It's okay.

17:24.739 --> 17:26.132
I don't like the dark.

17:26.262 --> 17:28.047
Can you turn on a light?

17:29.222 --> 17:30.571
I'm scared of the dark!

17:30.658 --> 17:32.225
Shut up!
There's a window right there.

17:32.312 --> 17:33.226
No! No!

17:33.313 --> 17:36.403
-Shh!
-No! No! No! No!

17:36.490 --> 17:40.146
-Cameron, stop!
-No! No! No!

17:40.276 --> 17:41.495
-Sit down.
-No!

17:41.582 --> 17:43.845
Cameron, stop!
I said stop, girl!

17:43.932 --> 17:45.325
Stop!

17:45.455 --> 17:46.717
Let me go.

17:48.719 --> 17:49.677
What you lookin' at?

17:57.598 --> 17:59.426
Uncle Chris,
please don't leave me here!

17:59.513 --> 18:01.819
Please! Please!
I'm scared!

18:01.906 --> 18:03.604
Please don't leave me here!

18:03.734 --> 18:05.475
-Please, I'm scared!
-Cameron...

18:05.562 --> 18:08.130
-Aunt Mia!
-Cameron...

18:08.261 --> 18:10.480
It ain't no use in
yellin' and screamin', baby.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.308
Nobody can hear you.

18:12.439 --> 18:13.744
Aunt Mia!

18:13.831 --> 18:16.007
Aunt Mia!

18:16.138 --> 18:18.358
Aunt Mia, I'm scared!

18:18.488 --> 18:20.316
Aunt Mia, please!

18:20.403 --> 18:22.579
Cameron...

18:22.666 --> 18:26.105
Believe me.
It won't help.

18:27.802 --> 18:28.803
Come.

18:34.548 --> 18:35.940
It's okay.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.860
This is your home now.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.002
Come on out.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.492
-Is this the niece?
-Her name is Cameron.

19:05.622 --> 19:08.799
Hi, Cameron.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.366
That's just
Joanne and Harlen.

19:10.453 --> 19:11.933
They harmless.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.848
You don't have to
worry about them.

19:13.978 --> 19:17.112
What you got there?

19:17.199 --> 19:20.333
Let her be.
She's still in shock.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.206
Well, that's where you'll sleep.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.208
I made some chicken earlier.
I put some to the side for you.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.949
You hungry?

19:28.079 --> 19:30.256
How come you ain't put
nothin' to the side for me?

19:30.386 --> 19:31.779
Hush, she's...

19:31.866 --> 19:33.824
She's our guest.

19:33.911 --> 19:37.480
I'll get you something later.

19:37.611 --> 19:41.005
And no matter what,
you never go behind here, okay?

19:41.092 --> 19:42.311
You understand?

19:42.442 --> 19:44.574
No matter what happens.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.750
Good.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.752
Now, no matter
how thirsty you get,

19:48.883 --> 19:50.319
don't drink the
Kool-Aid they give you.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.582
They put something in
it to make you sleepy.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.323
What should I drink, then?

19:54.454 --> 19:57.892
Anything else but that.

19:57.979 --> 20:02.157
Use the bathroom over there.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.854
It gets pretty cold
down here at night,

20:03.985 --> 20:08.119
so I'ma let you use my
blanket, but just for tonight.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.817
Don't get used to it.

20:09.947 --> 20:12.472
I don't wanna catch pneumonia.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.213
How long do you think
I'll have to stay down here?

20:17.346 --> 20:19.348
Until Mia say it's enough.

20:53.861 --> 20:54.992
Our Father
in the heavens,

20:55.123 --> 20:56.646
let Your name be sanctified.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.872
Let Your kingdom come.

21:05.002 --> 21:06.874
Let Your will take place

21:06.961 --> 21:11.139
as in Heaven, also on earth.

21:16.666 --> 21:21.149
Give us today our
bread for this day,

21:21.236 --> 21:25.371
and forgive us our debts as we
have also forgiven our debtors.

21:57.185 --> 21:59.927
But deliver
us from the wicked one.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.972
In Jesus' name, amen.

22:11.199 --> 22:13.201
I've been calling y'all
for almost a year

22:13.288 --> 22:14.681
about my daughter.

22:14.768 --> 22:17.510
And you have every right
to voice your concern.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.163
We will do everything we can

22:19.250 --> 22:21.296
to establish communication
with Ms. Smith.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.080
Has anyone gone to the house?

22:23.211 --> 22:24.908
We make periodic checks, yes.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.432
Liar!

22:26.519 --> 22:27.824
My sister stopped by

22:27.911 --> 22:29.304
and some Spanish
people live there now.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.306
You guys are not
doing your jobs.

22:31.437 --> 22:34.918
Look, you approved your
daughter staying with Mia.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.355
Okay, wait a minute.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.182
Are you blaming
my sister for this?

22:38.269 --> 22:40.097
Huh?

22:40.184 --> 22:41.708
How was I supposed to know
she'd stop taking my calls?

22:41.795 --> 22:44.275
Listen, I'm not
blaming anyone, okay?

22:44.406 --> 22:46.452
I-I'm simply saying we
cannot be held accountable

22:46.539 --> 22:49.368
for something we didn't know.

22:51.631 --> 22:52.980
It's...

22:53.110 --> 22:55.025
It's been a year.

22:55.112 --> 22:57.550
And you're just now
coming to us.

22:57.680 --> 23:01.031
I...

23:01.162 --> 23:04.513
If you had been doing your job,

23:04.600 --> 23:08.038
I wouldn't be needing
to come to you now.

23:08.125 --> 23:11.694
I thought she was in good hands.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.914
I thought Mia had changed
since she'd gotten out of jail.

23:14.001 --> 23:15.002
It's okay.

23:16.569 --> 23:17.961
Are you gonna help me
get my child back or not?

23:19.441 --> 23:22.792
Um...

23:22.923 --> 23:28.624
Ms. Smith, I'm truly sorry
for this...situation.

23:28.711 --> 23:31.192
I'll--I'll send the police
to all the addresses

23:31.279 --> 23:33.150
that we have on file for Mia.

23:33.281 --> 23:35.326
While we do that,

23:35.414 --> 23:38.286
please continue to contact
everyone that you know

23:38.373 --> 23:41.855
to see if you can
find out anything, okay?

23:41.985 --> 23:45.206
And you report it to me.

23:45.293 --> 23:49.253
Here's, um...my direct number.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.604
Please call it at any time.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.743
Please help me find my baby.

24:00.830 --> 24:03.311
I'll do everything in my power.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.403
Get Thomas to sleep?

24:08.534 --> 24:10.536
Good luck with that.
If you can get him down,

24:10.666 --> 24:12.538
I can take a long lunch,

24:12.625 --> 24:14.104
maybe head on over?

24:14.191 --> 24:15.802
Huh?

24:15.889 --> 24:18.152
Maybe I can handle
a little bit of, uh, uh...

24:18.239 --> 24:19.196
Let me call you back.

24:19.327 --> 24:21.590
That's your easy file!

24:21.721 --> 24:25.202
Mia Smith, jailed for
beating a man with a hammer,

24:25.289 --> 24:28.031
trapping him inside the closet,
and starving him to death!

24:28.162 --> 24:30.164
You said you vetted her.

24:30.251 --> 24:32.383
You told me that you'd
been to the house, Josh!

24:32.514 --> 24:34.037
I drove past it!

24:34.124 --> 24:35.735
Are you kidding me?

24:35.865 --> 24:37.737
Come on, you know
we're swamped around here.

24:37.824 --> 24:39.478
It's impossible to
handle all this casework.

24:39.565 --> 24:42.045
Now a little girl's
life is at stake,

24:42.132 --> 24:44.657
and all you needed to do
was type on your computer

24:44.744 --> 24:46.789
and pull up Mia's record.

24:46.876 --> 24:49.226
It took me all of, what?
15 minutes?

24:49.313 --> 24:52.229
-Okay, I'll stop by the house.
-You damn right you will!

24:52.360 --> 24:55.319
'Cause I'm not taking the
fall for you on this one.

24:55.406 --> 24:57.844
So if you want
your wife and child

24:57.931 --> 25:02.283
to have an employable father,
you handle this.

25:02.370 --> 25:03.414
- Okay, okay...
- Today!

25:03.545 --> 25:04.677
Okay!

25:07.767 --> 25:10.160
Yes, hi, I need the
address of a Mia Smith?

25:11.466 --> 25:12.815
Mia Smith.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.044
You have my checks?

25:24.131 --> 25:26.525
-Angela.
-Chris. Excuse me.

25:29.745 --> 25:32.269
Nancy still ain't get
her disability check.

25:32.356 --> 25:34.271
You probably gonna have to
take her down to the office.

25:34.358 --> 25:37.666
No, it's too risky.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.842
I'll figure something else out.

25:39.973 --> 25:42.932
In the meantime, I'll get her
some work outside the house.

25:43.063 --> 25:45.239
Unless she knows more than
one way to skin a cat.

25:45.326 --> 25:48.155
Okay, 'cause nobody gets
a free ride living here.

25:48.285 --> 25:50.461
Chris stopped getting
disability checks a year ago,

25:50.549 --> 25:52.507
right after he married you.

25:52.638 --> 25:53.552
He gettin' a free ride.

25:55.118 --> 25:56.598
You must have forgotten,

25:56.685 --> 25:57.904
I was the only one that
hold your mama down

25:58.034 --> 26:00.689
when she was in jail.
Trippin'.

26:00.776 --> 26:03.910
He did, I gotta give him that.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.739
I mean, we still getting checks
from Nancy and Joanne's kids

26:06.869 --> 26:08.305
and the custody check from
Cameron,

26:08.436 --> 26:11.091
so we're gonna be
nice for a while.

26:11.221 --> 26:12.222
-Okay.
-Smoke and relax.

26:13.310 --> 26:14.355
Ugh.

26:23.407 --> 26:25.279
It's some white man.

26:33.504 --> 26:36.116
I ain't expectin' nobody.

26:36.203 --> 26:38.335
What you want me to do?

26:38.466 --> 26:40.511
Get rid of him?

26:51.087 --> 26:52.349
Hi, uh, I'm Josh Goodman

26:52.480 --> 26:54.395
from the Department
of Health Services.

26:54.482 --> 26:57.311
-Are you Mia Smith?
-I am.

26:57.441 --> 27:00.531
Great, uh, I'm here to check up
on your niece, Cameron Smith.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.578
-Uh, what about her?
-Is she here?

27:03.709 --> 27:05.536
It's a man. He...

27:05.667 --> 27:07.016
He askin' about Cameron.

27:07.147 --> 27:09.453
No, she's at school.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.630
School?
It's almost 5 o'clock.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.936
Yeah, she's in a
after school program.

27:14.067 --> 27:16.112
-Dance.
-Okay, okay.

27:16.199 --> 27:18.027
Well, uh, I can just come in
and take a look around--

27:18.114 --> 27:19.942
Well, no.

27:20.029 --> 27:21.378
You know, the place is a mess

27:21.509 --> 27:24.077
and my niece isn't here.

27:24.164 --> 27:28.081
So why don't you try
coming back tomorrow?

27:28.211 --> 27:30.257
Well, I could just--
I could just do it right now.

27:30.387 --> 27:33.042
No, you probably should be goin'

27:33.173 --> 27:36.567
'cause it gets dark pretty
fast around here in the fall.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.178
And I don't think this
is a place you wanna be

27:38.265 --> 27:39.005
when it gets dark.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.139
You're probably right.

27:43.226 --> 27:45.968
Um, I will come back tomorrow.
First thing.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.057
-Please have your niece ready.
-I will.

27:48.188 --> 27:49.755
Okay, thank you.

28:36.802 --> 28:39.630
- They gone!
- What?

28:39.761 --> 28:41.502
How do you know?

28:41.589 --> 28:45.114
I saw them leaving last night.

28:45.245 --> 28:46.376
Are you sure?

28:46.463 --> 28:47.856
Yeah.

28:47.943 --> 28:51.512
They packed up
their SUV and left.

28:51.642 --> 28:52.861
It was about 10 people.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.304
Whew!

29:47.524 --> 29:51.659
Nancy! Where you at?

29:52.703 --> 29:53.661
-Let me get that.
-Here, babe.

29:55.097 --> 29:56.882
Get the rest of
the bags out the car,

29:56.969 --> 30:00.581
and then take the diapers
downstairs to Joanne, all right?

30:00.711 --> 30:03.627
Them kids costing me a fortune.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.544
Food better be ready, too.

30:07.631 --> 30:09.982
-'Cause I'm starving!
-Almost...

30:10.069 --> 30:11.505
Well, hurry up!

30:11.635 --> 30:12.985
Cameron!

30:15.161 --> 30:16.510
It's ready.

30:27.303 --> 30:28.174
Hey!

30:28.827 --> 30:29.828
Hey!

30:31.177 --> 30:32.134
What the...

30:32.265 --> 30:33.701
hell is wrong with you?

30:52.981 --> 30:55.027
Y'all two, stop
runnin' in this house!

30:59.988 --> 31:01.250
The old lady down
the street says

31:01.381 --> 31:03.426
she'll buy the extra
television for $300.

31:03.513 --> 31:06.429
Fine, sell it to her.

31:06.516 --> 31:09.780
But we paid more for that
when we bought it in Atlanta.

31:09.911 --> 31:13.697
Ma, you had it
goin' on out there.

31:13.828 --> 31:16.178
Then you had to change it up
bringin' Cameron into all this.

31:16.265 --> 31:17.788
It's the money that
I'm getting from Cameron

31:17.919 --> 31:20.791
that takes care of
you and your baby.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.142
Okay, so then let me
take the other kids

31:23.229 --> 31:25.144
down to the office,
get them signed up,

31:25.231 --> 31:26.754
so we can get some
benefits or something.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.712
Are you crazy?

31:28.799 --> 31:30.497
What's the point of making
Nan and Jo have these babies

31:30.627 --> 31:32.325
if we ain't cashin' in?

31:32.412 --> 31:35.415
If we take them kids down and
put them in the system here,

31:35.545 --> 31:37.547
that's gonna lead
everybody to us.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.593
Ain't no way the
system in Tennessee

31:39.680 --> 31:41.203
is connected to
the one in Atlanta.

31:41.290 --> 31:42.552
Yeah, well, I'm not
about to find out.

31:42.639 --> 31:44.380
Come on, Ma!

31:44.467 --> 31:45.991
All I'm sayin' is

31:46.121 --> 31:47.383
we ain't been flossin'
like how we used to

31:47.470 --> 31:49.820
since we left Atlanta.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.649
We gon' have to make some
decisions about them kids soon.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.696
Like what?

31:55.783 --> 31:57.350
Maybe sell two of 'em.

31:57.437 --> 32:00.527
Get a little extra money.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.050
Don't nobody get a free ride.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.359
We gon' be all right.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.056
I got a little somethin'
somethin' brewing.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.275
But Ma--

32:09.362 --> 32:11.451
I said I'm gonna
take care of it!

32:13.975 --> 32:15.281
You right.

32:20.286 --> 32:21.809
Bingo.

32:23.376 --> 32:25.117
Who's that?

32:29.599 --> 32:31.906
Yeah,
I've always loved kids.

32:31.993 --> 32:33.125
Especially when they ain't mine.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.605
I know that's right.

32:40.654 --> 32:44.179
So, how long have
you been a nurse?

32:44.266 --> 32:46.007
Over 15 years.

32:46.138 --> 32:47.574
Wow.

32:47.661 --> 32:49.706
Ever deliver any kids?

32:49.837 --> 32:52.927
Ugh, I can do it
with my eyes closed.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.450
Hold that thought.

32:58.193 --> 32:59.586
I'm allergic to a lot of things,

32:59.673 --> 33:02.284
so I need to keep these near me.

33:02.415 --> 33:03.677
Sorry to hear that.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.461
It's okay, I'm used to it.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.167
These keep the old
ticker tickin'.

33:16.820 --> 33:18.126
Oh...

33:19.954 --> 33:22.565
Doesn't count.
Divorced.

33:22.652 --> 33:24.350
Mm.

33:25.264 --> 33:28.136
So, where were we?

33:28.267 --> 33:31.226
Well, we were talkin'
about you, your life and...

33:31.357 --> 33:35.013
Any family?

33:35.100 --> 33:37.928
War had big effects on me.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.626
Couldn't find a job
to save my life.

33:39.756 --> 33:42.803
Funny how that goes.

33:42.890 --> 33:43.978
Became a burden to
my family and friends,

33:44.109 --> 33:46.894
so no support there.

33:46.981 --> 33:49.549
But I get by pretty well
with my disability checks.

33:49.636 --> 33:52.117
I bet you do.

33:52.204 --> 33:53.901
Yeah.

33:55.207 --> 33:57.774
Now all I need is a
good-listening cutie

33:57.861 --> 33:59.863
like yourself
to make my life better.

34:01.691 --> 34:02.910
Well...

34:06.435 --> 34:07.741
I can do you one better.

34:08.655 --> 34:12.092
I have a big house, and...

34:12.179 --> 34:14.530
I could use a hero
like you to share it with.

34:16.489 --> 34:17.577
Interested?

34:24.409 --> 34:25.585
Trish?

34:28.152 --> 34:29.067
Hey, Trish, it's me!

34:32.244 --> 34:33.375
Trish?

34:34.942 --> 34:36.074
Okay.

34:46.431 --> 34:47.259
Trish?

34:49.130 --> 34:50.436
Trish?

34:51.480 --> 34:53.960
Oh my god.

34:55.918 --> 34:57.094
Trish.

34:58.139 --> 35:00.446
Trish, Trish.

35:00.533 --> 35:03.536
-Trish, wake up.
-Cam? Cam?

35:03.623 --> 35:04.798
Oh, Cam,
is that you, baby?

35:04.885 --> 35:06.104
No, no, it's me. It's Renee.

35:06.191 --> 35:08.758
Trish, I need you to wake up.
Wake up.

35:08.845 --> 35:10.282
-Where's my baby?
-I don't know.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.066
-Where's Cam?
-Come here, come here.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.894
- Come here, come here.
- Where's Cam?

35:14.024 --> 35:16.331
I don't know.
I don't know.

35:16.462 --> 35:18.159
But it's okay.
I'm here. I got you.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.205
My baby...

35:20.335 --> 35:21.423
I got you.

35:21.510 --> 35:22.381
It's okay, it's okay.

35:22.511 --> 35:23.860
I know, I know.

35:23.947 --> 35:25.601
I know.

35:25.688 --> 35:27.212
I know, I'm here.

35:27.299 --> 35:28.996
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

35:39.963 --> 35:42.618
I brought you something.

35:42.705 --> 35:44.794
I made some for the
family I keep house for.

35:44.925 --> 35:46.840
I knew today was your birthday.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.930
How?

35:50.060 --> 35:52.019
I saw it on some papers
that Mia keeps upstairs.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.109
Make a wish.

36:06.816 --> 36:08.383
What did you wish for?

36:08.470 --> 36:10.733
What do you think?

36:10.820 --> 36:13.040
I've got a gift for you.

36:15.347 --> 36:18.654
When's the last time
you was outside?

36:18.741 --> 36:21.614
I can't remember.

36:21.744 --> 36:25.879
Well, now you got a piece
of the outside with you.

36:27.097 --> 36:30.623
I have God with me.

36:30.753 --> 36:34.322
I hear you every night
sayin' the Lord's Prayer.

36:34.409 --> 36:36.150
And you keep that.

36:36.237 --> 36:38.196
You keep hope.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.067
That's all that's
gonna see you through.

37:03.525 --> 37:04.570
Oh!

37:08.095 --> 37:10.837
I thought you said
you lived here alone.

37:10.967 --> 37:12.882
Oh, he don't count.

37:13.927 --> 37:15.798
You know what?

37:15.885 --> 37:18.888
Maybe I should think about our
moving in plan a little more

37:18.975 --> 37:22.718
and give you an
answer when I'm sober.

37:22.805 --> 37:23.850
How about we meet up tomorrow?

37:23.937 --> 37:28.898
Well, I would love that.

37:29.029 --> 37:32.728
Um, but at least let me show
you the best part of the house.

37:35.383 --> 37:41.476
It is where you and I...

37:41.607 --> 37:43.913
are gonna spend the
majority of our time.

37:48.309 --> 37:49.615
I dare you to try to leave me.

37:54.228 --> 37:55.621
Then show me.

37:55.708 --> 37:57.144
Oh, I will.

37:58.624 --> 38:01.757
You won't be needing
that, you know?

38:01.844 --> 38:04.151
Come on with your pretty self.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.636
This is exciting.

38:15.728 --> 38:16.729
Go on in.
I'ma get the light.

38:16.816 --> 38:18.383
Okay.

38:20.341 --> 38:21.908
Hey.

38:22.038 --> 38:24.302
Hey. This isn't funny.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.391
Open the door.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.610
Let me out.

38:28.697 --> 38:32.397
Please, please open the door!

38:32.527 --> 38:34.616
Ain't gonna help.

38:34.703 --> 38:35.835
Might as well get used to it.

38:43.016 --> 38:44.974
What the hell are
you talking about?

38:45.061 --> 38:48.282
She can't just leave us here.

38:48.369 --> 38:50.502
We've been stuck in the
basement I don't know how long.

38:51.459 --> 38:52.982
Well, when she opens the door,

38:53.113 --> 38:54.419
we need to work together--

38:54.549 --> 38:57.030
Don't you think we've
tried that already?

38:57.117 --> 39:01.121
All we got was a hot spoon
to the skin and a beatin'.

39:01.208 --> 39:03.384
She ain't never
gonna let you go.

39:03.471 --> 39:04.733
How old are you?

39:04.820 --> 39:06.692
16.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.085
This is Cameron.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.349
I'm Nancy.

39:11.436 --> 39:15.701
He's Harlen,
and she's Joanne.

39:15.831 --> 39:18.530
-How far along are you?
-Eight months.

39:18.660 --> 39:20.314
Great, so when you
go to the hospital,

39:20.445 --> 39:21.576
you need to tell them
about everything that's--

39:21.663 --> 39:23.273
There ain't no hospital.

39:23.404 --> 39:24.492
Jo gonna have
the baby right here

39:24.623 --> 39:26.842
just like all of us.

39:27.626 --> 39:29.715
What others?

39:29.845 --> 39:32.544
How many children are there?

39:32.631 --> 39:34.894
Between me and Jo?
Four.

39:47.907 --> 39:49.517
We need to get
her to a hospital.

39:49.648 --> 39:51.171
We ain't goin' nowhere.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.086
Hey, uh, clean the
blood up off the floor.

39:53.216 --> 39:55.175
If we don't,
she could bleed out!

39:55.262 --> 39:57.133
Bitch, I said we're not leaving.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.527
Now just help with the baby.

39:59.614 --> 40:00.920
Push, Jo!

40:04.053 --> 40:05.446
Push!

40:05.533 --> 40:07.230
There you go, that's it.

40:07.317 --> 40:08.928
It's coming!

40:11.496 --> 40:13.672
Wait...

40:13.759 --> 40:16.022
It's not breathing.

40:16.152 --> 40:17.719
Why isn't it breathing?

40:17.850 --> 40:19.155
My god, what's happening?

40:19.286 --> 40:20.635
What's happening?

40:20.766 --> 40:22.855
Again?

40:22.942 --> 40:24.073
What the hell's wrong with you,

40:24.160 --> 40:26.032
pushing out all
these dead babies?

40:26.119 --> 40:28.338
What kind of monster are you?

40:28.469 --> 40:30.253
She just lost her child!

40:30.340 --> 40:31.559
Bitch, you need to
stay out of business

40:31.690 --> 40:33.953
that don't concern you.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.130
Uh, bury it outside.

40:37.217 --> 40:39.698
I think the shovel is
over there next to the--

40:39.785 --> 40:41.003
Where do you think you're goin'?

40:43.005 --> 40:45.051
Grab her, Ang!
Grab her, Ang!

40:50.317 --> 40:51.449
I'm so sorry, Jo.

40:53.276 --> 40:54.582
I'ma keep you in my prayers.

40:57.019 --> 40:58.804
If you really wanna help her,
we have to get out of here.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.675
The last time we
tried to escape--

41:00.762 --> 41:04.026
I don't care
if it didn't work.

41:04.157 --> 41:06.768
Look at Joanne.

41:06.855 --> 41:09.554
No one should live like this.

41:09.684 --> 41:12.774
Oh, we have...

41:12.905 --> 41:14.384
to keep trying...

41:20.042 --> 41:23.132
Help! Somebody help!
Help!

41:23.219 --> 41:24.264
It's okay,
just--just breathe.

41:24.351 --> 41:26.962
Help!

41:27.049 --> 41:28.137
Help!

41:28.224 --> 41:30.270
Somebody help!

41:30.400 --> 41:31.445
Give me my stick.

41:31.532 --> 41:32.925
Help!

41:42.587 --> 41:44.110
Just what the hell is
goin' on down here?

41:44.197 --> 41:45.720
We have to get her to a doctor.

41:46.591 --> 41:48.027
I need to
keep these near me.

41:48.114 --> 41:50.029
She don't
need no damn doctor.

41:50.116 --> 41:51.247
She just need them pills.

41:51.334 --> 41:52.597
Cameron, go to my
medicine cabinet

41:52.727 --> 41:53.989
and give me the brown bottle.

41:54.076 --> 41:55.469
Hurry up.

41:58.428 --> 41:59.429
Nancy, you
just gonna sit there

41:59.560 --> 42:00.779
or are you gonna do somethin'?

42:00.866 --> 42:02.171
What?

42:02.258 --> 42:03.695
I don't know, CPR or something.

42:03.782 --> 42:05.261
I don't know how!

42:05.392 --> 42:07.655
I can't breathe.

42:07.742 --> 42:08.787
Shut up!

42:12.094 --> 42:13.182
Don't give them to me, stupid.

42:13.269 --> 42:14.662
Give them to her.

42:22.801 --> 42:24.498
What's happening?

42:34.421 --> 42:36.336
Oh, this bad.

42:36.423 --> 42:37.903
What did you do?

42:39.818 --> 42:41.646
I-I didn't do anything.

42:41.733 --> 42:43.604
No, this is all your fault.

42:43.735 --> 42:45.650
No...

42:45.737 --> 42:46.868
Yeah, the police are
gonna make you pay for this.

42:46.955 --> 42:48.261
No!

42:48.391 --> 42:49.523
They gonna
give you the chair

42:49.610 --> 42:50.959
for killing this white woman.

42:51.090 --> 42:52.265
-Help me.
-Shut up.

42:52.352 --> 42:53.701
Please help me--

42:53.788 --> 42:54.920
I said shut up and
don't touch me!

42:58.010 --> 42:59.011
Now look at me.

42:59.968 --> 43:02.492
Now, I'm gonna help you.

43:02.623 --> 43:04.712
But you remember that
at any given moment,

43:04.799 --> 43:07.846
I can tell the
police what you did.

43:07.976 --> 43:11.023
And they will fry you.

43:11.153 --> 43:13.242
So you remember where
your loyalties lie.

43:14.200 --> 43:15.680
No, no, no, no, no, no.

43:15.810 --> 43:18.552
Mia, what are we gonna do now?

43:18.639 --> 43:20.598
Hide it where you hid
all the other bodies.

43:22.948 --> 43:24.689
Mia, this different.

43:24.819 --> 43:27.169
That's a white woman.

43:27.256 --> 43:28.693
And you know them people
gonna come lookin' for her.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.479
Then I guess you need to hide
the body real good, then.

43:35.961 --> 43:37.310
Damn!

43:37.397 --> 43:38.790
Hey, Harlen, go
get the tools, man.

43:38.877 --> 43:40.139
Hurry up!

43:51.193 --> 43:53.718
I'm only gonna
say this once.

43:53.805 --> 43:56.590
It's not your fault.

43:56.677 --> 43:57.591
But Mia said--

43:57.722 --> 43:59.811
To hell with Mia.

43:59.898 --> 44:03.292
I need you to know that
it's not your fault.

44:03.379 --> 44:05.512
No matter what happens, okay?

44:07.993 --> 44:09.081
Cameron!

44:09.211 --> 44:11.387
Get up and go clean the kitchen!

44:40.634 --> 44:41.940
He be actin' a fool!

44:42.070 --> 44:43.724
A straight fool.

44:43.855 --> 44:45.378
I love me some
Will Smith, though.

44:49.774 --> 44:51.993
Hey, y'all better stop
running through this house.

44:59.348 --> 45:01.960
Oof, girl! You stink.

45:03.526 --> 45:06.225
I bet you haven't
showered in, like, what?

45:06.355 --> 45:07.182
A month?

45:09.184 --> 45:12.622
You are one ugly girl.

45:12.753 --> 45:14.407
You know that?

45:14.494 --> 45:17.105
But I guess it's...genetic.

45:20.065 --> 45:22.241
Ugly mother.

45:22.328 --> 45:23.938
Ugly daughter.

45:33.513 --> 45:34.383
Super funny.

45:34.514 --> 45:37.299
He be actin' a fool!

45:37.430 --> 45:39.171
I love me some Will Smith,
though, babe.

45:39.258 --> 45:40.694
I know, I know, I know.

45:44.742 --> 45:47.048
I know they ain't broke nothin'.
Go get them kids!

45:48.093 --> 45:49.877
Can't even watch my show!

45:51.836 --> 45:53.707
Can't even watch my show...

45:55.448 --> 45:57.189
Yeah, that's right.

46:06.502 --> 46:08.330
You done with them dishes yet?

46:08.417 --> 46:09.636
Yeah.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.464
Good.

46:11.551 --> 46:12.552
Take out the trash.

46:12.682 --> 46:14.380
I'll put the food away.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.643
Okay.

46:43.975 --> 46:45.063
God...

46:47.543 --> 46:50.111
I know that you're everywhere,

46:50.198 --> 46:52.331
so I know that you can hear me.

46:55.725 --> 46:57.727
Please...

46:57.858 --> 46:59.338
help me.

47:02.080 --> 47:05.257
Hey Mia, this girl out
here talkin' to trees.

47:05.387 --> 47:06.867
What she sayin'?

47:06.954 --> 47:08.826
How the hell would I know?

47:08.913 --> 47:10.828
Look like she
praying or something.

47:10.915 --> 47:12.525
I don't know why.
It ain't helped her yet.

47:13.439 --> 47:14.788
Cameron's smart.

47:14.875 --> 47:15.876
She ain't like the other ones.

47:16.007 --> 47:17.225
Fool!

47:17.356 --> 47:18.270
Please, okay?

47:18.400 --> 47:20.228
She ain't even gone to school.

47:20.359 --> 47:21.534
You ain't gotta go
to school to be smart,

47:21.621 --> 47:23.362
and you know that.

47:23.449 --> 47:25.538
She quiet.

47:25.625 --> 47:27.235
She observes.

47:27.366 --> 47:29.324
She different.

47:29.411 --> 47:30.848
And most important,
she ain't afraid of you.

47:33.285 --> 47:36.592
Chris, what you
even talkin' about?

47:36.723 --> 47:39.769
I so much as say "boo," that
girl be cryin' for her mama.

47:39.900 --> 47:43.817
Listen, I know she knows that
you call the shots, aight?

47:43.948 --> 47:45.471
But deep down, she know

47:45.558 --> 47:46.776
there is somebody out
there lookin' for her.

47:46.907 --> 47:48.996
Somebody who cares about her.

47:49.083 --> 47:51.694
And sometimes that's all the
hope you need to keep goin'.

47:51.781 --> 47:54.480
Mark my word, the
first chance she gets,

47:54.567 --> 47:55.960
that girl gonna try
to run away from here.

47:56.090 --> 47:57.048
I'm tellin' you.

48:01.400 --> 48:03.402
Kitchen is done.

48:03.532 --> 48:05.012
Good.

48:05.143 --> 48:06.405
Get back to the basement.

48:17.416 --> 48:18.896
Can't sleep either?

48:24.031 --> 48:25.250
I used to do that.

48:26.512 --> 48:27.774
Look outside and wonder

48:27.861 --> 48:29.689
if I'd ever get
a chance to be out there

48:29.819 --> 48:33.388
without Mia on my back.

48:33.475 --> 48:35.956
I feel like you know
so much about me.

48:36.043 --> 48:38.393
I never even asked
how you met Mia.

48:38.524 --> 48:41.266
How any of y'all met her.

48:42.702 --> 48:44.138
Joanne ran away from home,

48:44.269 --> 48:46.880
and she was lookin'
for a mother figure.

48:47.011 --> 48:48.882
She thought she was
gettin' that from Mia.

48:50.579 --> 48:54.366
Harlen, he was...lookin'
for somebody to love him,

48:54.496 --> 48:57.238
treat him like a man.

48:57.369 --> 48:59.632
She told him that she loved
him, and he believed her.

49:01.634 --> 49:04.028
And you?

49:07.074 --> 49:09.381
I was just lookin'
for money to get high.

49:09.468 --> 49:10.643
And Mia offered me that too.

49:13.298 --> 49:15.648
She'll become whatever you
need her to be to reel you in.

49:17.041 --> 49:19.695
And once you fall for it,

49:19.826 --> 49:21.741
she closes the basement door
in your face.

49:25.092 --> 49:28.269
I'm not on drugs anymore,
so there's that.

49:31.185 --> 49:33.100
But you?

49:33.231 --> 49:35.885
You keep lookin' outside.

49:36.016 --> 49:37.322
You don't let these
four walls determine

49:37.409 --> 49:39.150
how your life gon' turn out.

49:41.979 --> 49:43.502
Okay?

50:01.433 --> 50:03.087
Excuse me, ma'am?

50:03.217 --> 50:04.697
Can I carry your bag
for some spare change?

50:05.959 --> 50:07.091
Excuse me?

50:07.178 --> 50:09.180
Ma'am?

50:09.310 --> 50:11.051
Hey.

50:11.138 --> 50:13.532
Look, I-I know you see
a homeless drunk man,

50:13.619 --> 50:16.230
but...I served the country.

50:16.361 --> 50:17.971
Even went overseas.

50:18.058 --> 50:19.190
Did you, now?

50:19.320 --> 50:20.582
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hm.

50:20.669 --> 50:22.062
Even saw some action.

50:22.149 --> 50:24.586
Okay, which war?

50:24.673 --> 50:25.587
Iraq?

50:25.674 --> 50:28.329
When did you serve?

50:28.416 --> 50:29.243
Ah, it's been a--

50:29.330 --> 50:31.376
Now, you see that?

50:31.463 --> 50:34.509
If it's one thing I
can't stand, it's a liar.

50:34.596 --> 50:36.511
If you wanted some money
to get you a drink,

50:36.642 --> 50:38.731
all you had to do was ask.

50:39.993 --> 50:41.125
Yes, ma'am.

50:45.912 --> 50:47.827
'Cause you know even
I like a good drink.

50:49.307 --> 50:52.092
You really didn't have to
come up with this fantasy.

50:52.223 --> 50:53.920
I apologize.

50:54.051 --> 50:56.183
No worries.

50:56.270 --> 50:58.403
Oh...

51:00.013 --> 51:02.929
If you lookin' for
a job, I have one.

51:03.016 --> 51:05.932
Comes with a place to
stay and food to eat.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.238
And alcohol.

51:09.588 --> 51:11.198
Sounds like my kind of work.

51:11.329 --> 51:14.245
I just have one rule...

51:14.332 --> 51:17.117
When I tell you to do
something, you do it.

51:17.248 --> 51:19.206
No questions asked.

51:19.293 --> 51:20.947
Are we clear?

51:21.034 --> 51:22.818
You pay me,

51:22.905 --> 51:24.516
you tell me to jump,
I won't even ask how high.

51:25.604 --> 51:27.823
Good.
You can start tonight.

51:27.954 --> 51:29.086
-Get in.
-Yes, ma'am.

51:35.309 --> 51:37.006
So, what's your name?

51:37.137 --> 51:39.966
Travis, but everyone
calls me Pastor.

51:40.053 --> 51:42.099
Pastor? Why?

51:43.361 --> 51:44.449
Right here.

51:48.844 --> 51:50.063
Thank the Lord.

51:53.675 --> 51:55.024
Want some?

51:55.155 --> 51:56.287
No, I don't know
where your lips been.

51:57.418 --> 51:58.506
So these them, huh?

51:58.593 --> 52:00.987
Mm-hmm.

52:01.074 --> 52:03.468
The hotel behind
the liquor store.

52:05.992 --> 52:08.125
What about buddy?

52:08.212 --> 52:09.996
No.

52:10.127 --> 52:12.390
But these other
three, they can work.

52:12.477 --> 52:13.826
Please, Mia, not Cam.

52:13.913 --> 52:15.610
She just 16.

52:15.697 --> 52:17.743
She's old enough.

52:17.830 --> 52:19.832
She gonna have to
learn about it someday.

52:20.920 --> 52:21.921
Wait, what?

52:23.009 --> 52:26.578
Even her?

52:26.708 --> 52:29.494
Yeah, even her.

52:29.624 --> 52:32.323
I heard that men like women
that's already knocked up.

52:47.642 --> 52:49.383
Nancy?

52:49.514 --> 52:51.951
What?

52:52.081 --> 52:53.518
What's gonna happen
at the motel tomorrow?

53:01.526 --> 53:04.616
Cam, you, um, remember those
Bible verses you used to say

53:04.746 --> 53:07.358
when you first got here?

53:07.488 --> 53:10.535
The ones I said
got on my nerves?

53:10.665 --> 53:11.623
Yeah.

53:13.494 --> 53:15.757
They didn't.

53:15.888 --> 53:17.716
They actually...

53:17.803 --> 53:19.631
calmed me in a weird way.

53:24.810 --> 53:27.769
Tomorrow...

53:27.856 --> 53:31.556
when Pastor takes
us to that motel,

53:31.686 --> 53:34.385
I want you to say those
verses to yourself, you hear?

53:36.735 --> 53:40.173
Just keep sayin'
them over and over

53:40.260 --> 53:42.480
until it stops.

53:43.698 --> 53:45.222
Okay.

53:49.748 --> 53:51.880
Cam, I know you
lost a lot of faith

53:51.967 --> 53:55.841
when that lady died
down here, but...

53:55.928 --> 53:57.582
but I think it jumped on me.

53:59.888 --> 54:02.413
I'm gonna get us out of here.

54:02.500 --> 54:04.676
All of us.

54:04.763 --> 54:08.375
Just hold on, okay?

54:08.462 --> 54:09.768
Hold on.

54:41.756 --> 54:43.889
I been waiting all day for this.

55:02.255 --> 55:04.126
Our father in
the heavens,

55:04.257 --> 55:07.391
let Your name be sanctified.

55:07.478 --> 55:09.741
Let Your kingdom come.

55:09.828 --> 55:11.656
Let Your word take place

55:11.786 --> 55:13.527
as in Heaven, also on earth.

55:22.580 --> 55:25.060
She all we got left.

55:25.147 --> 55:27.062
Take her or leave her.

55:51.086 --> 55:53.306
No, no, no, no, no, no.

55:53.393 --> 55:55.395
Relax.

55:58.180 --> 56:00.313
You're a nice girl.

56:00.444 --> 56:01.749
You want candy?

56:01.836 --> 56:02.968
I have candy.

56:14.371 --> 56:15.197
...and the United States

56:15.328 --> 56:16.895
have little reason to fear

56:17.025 --> 56:19.027
importing inflation
from overseas.

56:19.114 --> 56:21.508
The European Central Bank
on Wednesday

56:21.639 --> 56:23.945
kept interest rates unchanged,

56:24.032 --> 56:26.644
resisting pressure to join
other major central banks

56:26.731 --> 56:27.993
and help stimulate the...

56:31.823 --> 56:33.433
How we do?

56:33.564 --> 56:36.393
$790.

56:38.090 --> 56:40.745
There's plenty more
where that came from.

56:40.832 --> 56:42.399
That place is full of
Johns around the clock.

56:44.357 --> 56:46.228
Go on, put them
in the shower,

56:46.359 --> 56:49.406
and then give 'em some
leftovers out the refrigerator.

56:51.103 --> 56:53.148
You heard her!
What you waitin' for?

56:53.235 --> 56:54.585
Go!

56:57.109 --> 56:58.110
Move it!

58:10.138 --> 58:11.792
It's coming?

58:11.923 --> 58:12.837
Breathe, breathe.

58:14.882 --> 58:16.405
Mia!

58:16.493 --> 58:17.581
What are
you yelling about?

58:17.711 --> 58:19.278
It's Joanne!

58:19.408 --> 58:20.714
What's wrong with Joanne?

58:20.801 --> 58:22.368
She's having the baby!

58:25.153 --> 58:26.546
Okay, well, come on.

58:26.677 --> 58:27.808
Push it out.

58:30.115 --> 58:31.116
Push it out.

58:32.987 --> 58:35.076
Go on and push.
You can do it.

58:35.163 --> 58:36.295
You got it.

58:39.211 --> 58:41.169
Cameron, please go
get some towels.

58:41.256 --> 58:42.562
You can do it,
okay?

59:02.800 --> 59:05.629
You got yourself a
beautiful baby girl.

59:05.716 --> 59:07.369
Yes, I do

59:07.456 --> 59:10.982
have myself a
beautiful baby girl.

59:15.073 --> 59:16.727
I'm gonna call her Baby Mia.

59:20.034 --> 59:22.471
Yes, baby.

59:22.559 --> 59:24.038
Yes...

59:24.125 --> 59:25.997
What...

59:27.781 --> 59:29.304
Oh,!

59:30.567 --> 59:31.829
Pay me!

59:31.959 --> 59:33.004
Good play, good play.

59:34.440 --> 59:36.398
Baby, please shut that baby up.

59:36.485 --> 59:38.009
Okay, put a little
powder in the bottle

59:38.096 --> 59:39.793
and give it to her,
make her ass go to sleep.

59:39.880 --> 59:41.490
All right.

59:41.578 --> 59:44.493
As I was saying before
I was rudely interrupted,

59:44.581 --> 59:46.757
we've been gone long enough.

59:46.844 --> 59:49.673
Cam's 17 now,
practically an adult.

59:49.803 --> 59:52.806
Her mama probably not even
lookin' for her no more.

59:52.937 --> 59:55.156
I just don't get why we
can't go back to Atlanta.

59:58.029 --> 1:00:00.858
She was just a little hungry.
But, but look, Angela,

1:00:00.945 --> 1:00:03.121
ain't nobody trying to go
back down to Atlanta, all right?

1:00:03.208 --> 1:00:05.036
I'm trying to go
back down to Atlanta.

1:00:05.123 --> 1:00:06.646
I ain't never been to Atlanta.

1:00:06.777 --> 1:00:08.300
And ain't nobody askin'
you to go either.

1:00:08.430 --> 1:00:09.475
Exactly.

1:00:09.562 --> 1:00:10.694
Well, if I were to go,

1:00:10.824 --> 1:00:13.740
and I'm not sayin' that I am,

1:00:13.871 --> 1:00:16.134
Pastor would come with us.

1:00:16.221 --> 1:00:17.788
He done earned his
spot in the family.

1:00:19.137 --> 1:00:21.574
Well, I'm tired of the people,

1:00:21.661 --> 1:00:24.055
and I'm tired of
smelling like cows!

1:00:24.142 --> 1:00:25.404
We not flossin' down here--

1:00:25.491 --> 1:00:28.450
--like we used to in Atlanta.

1:00:28.537 --> 1:00:30.931
I'm so tired of
hearing you say that.

1:00:31.018 --> 1:00:33.934
Ain't nobody keeping you here.

1:00:34.065 --> 1:00:36.937
So you sayin' I can leave?

1:00:37.024 --> 1:00:38.460
If I was forcin' you to stay,

1:00:38.547 --> 1:00:40.506
you'd be locked in the
basement...

1:00:58.350 --> 1:00:59.873
Girl, she
playing with you!

1:01:04.922 --> 1:01:09.056
All I'm sayin', if you wanna
go, you can go on and go.

1:01:09.143 --> 1:01:11.668
Hell, that's two
less mouths to feed.

1:01:11.798 --> 1:01:13.844
Now, I know that's right.

1:01:13.974 --> 1:01:16.629
But I'm gonna need you
to take Joanne's kids with you,

1:01:16.716 --> 1:01:19.414
'cause I'mma give
Pastor the room.

1:01:19.545 --> 1:01:21.634
And you see if you can get
they benefits started up again

1:01:21.721 --> 1:01:25.072
down in Atlanta.

1:01:25.159 --> 1:01:26.117
Sit down.

1:01:30.121 --> 1:01:33.385
I'm sending two kids
up there with you.

1:01:33.472 --> 1:01:35.996
And it better be two

1:01:36.083 --> 1:01:37.955
when Pastor comes
to check things out.

1:01:44.004 --> 1:01:46.441
Okay, where were we?

1:01:46.528 --> 1:01:48.008
I smell some money.

1:01:48.095 --> 1:01:49.401
You about to give me 20 points.

1:01:49.488 --> 1:01:51.055
Game, pow!

1:01:51.142 --> 1:01:55.015
She's taking my kids.
She's taking my kids.

1:01:55.102 --> 1:01:57.539
-She's taking my kids.
-What are you talking about?

1:01:57.626 --> 1:02:00.151
Angela's moving back, and
she's taking my kids with her!

1:02:03.241 --> 1:02:04.677
What about the baby?

1:02:04.764 --> 1:02:06.287
I don't know!

1:02:06.418 --> 1:02:08.725
I don't know what
she's gonna do.

1:02:11.902 --> 1:02:14.121
Lookin' at those
trees ain't gonna help.

1:02:14.208 --> 1:02:15.514
I know you think
God is everywhere,

1:02:15.601 --> 1:02:17.124
but he ain't, 'cause if he was,

1:02:17.255 --> 1:02:19.431
he wouldn't keep letting all
this bad stuff happen to us.

1:02:21.302 --> 1:02:23.261
It is not God that lets bad
things happen to people.

1:02:25.611 --> 1:02:27.091
But he ain't savin'
us from it, either.

1:02:30.224 --> 1:02:31.748
You think God gonna let
me hold my babies again?

1:02:33.532 --> 1:02:34.707
I hope so.

1:03:18.142 --> 1:03:19.839
I can watch
baby Mia in the kitchen.

1:03:19.970 --> 1:03:21.232
If you want.

1:03:24.235 --> 1:03:26.411
No, not in the kitchen.

1:03:26.498 --> 1:03:28.892
That's too dangerous in there.

1:03:28.979 --> 1:03:31.111
Uh, you can take her to
the basement, all right?

1:03:31.198 --> 1:03:32.504
I'ma go handle some business.

1:03:50.391 --> 1:03:51.523
Oh!

1:03:53.481 --> 1:03:55.744
Oh, she look like my mama.

1:03:55.875 --> 1:03:56.789
She's beautiful.

1:03:59.270 --> 1:04:02.708
I know Mia call her Baby Mia,
but that's not her name.

1:04:02.795 --> 1:04:04.362
That's not your name!

1:04:04.492 --> 1:04:06.407
It's Marie.

1:04:06.494 --> 1:04:07.844
That's my mama name.

1:04:10.411 --> 1:04:11.760
What's your mama name?

1:04:11.848 --> 1:04:13.501
Cathy.

1:04:13.588 --> 1:04:15.764
I used to think
she was so strict,

1:04:15.852 --> 1:04:18.115
but now I know
she just loved me.

1:04:20.291 --> 1:04:22.467
What about your mother?

1:04:22.554 --> 1:04:24.512
Ruth.

1:04:24.599 --> 1:04:26.819
She died when I
was a little girl.

1:04:26.906 --> 1:04:29.430
I don't remember much about her.

1:04:29.517 --> 1:04:31.476
Been alone ever since.

1:04:31.606 --> 1:04:34.392
My mother's name is Patricia.

1:04:34.479 --> 1:04:36.829
She's the prettiest
lady you'd ever see.

1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:39.963
She's funny, too.

1:04:40.093 --> 1:04:43.009
She looked out for me back then.

1:04:43.096 --> 1:04:44.881
My other mother's name is Nancy.

1:04:47.492 --> 1:04:50.495
She's brave and strong...

1:04:52.584 --> 1:04:53.759
She's the mother who
takes care of me now.

1:04:54.891 --> 1:04:56.544
She take care of all of us.

1:05:21.700 --> 1:05:22.614
Do you want a piece?

1:05:22.744 --> 1:05:23.920
It's your favorite.

1:05:26.357 --> 1:05:27.445
Thank you.

1:05:30.361 --> 1:05:31.884
You a police officer, right?

1:05:34.843 --> 1:05:36.193
I saw your badge
the first time we met.

1:05:38.369 --> 1:05:39.587
Surprised?

1:05:41.111 --> 1:05:42.808
Nothing surprises me anymore.

1:05:44.549 --> 1:05:47.073
My mama said that,
when you in trouble,

1:05:47.160 --> 1:05:50.337
you should always
call the police.

1:05:50.424 --> 1:05:53.384
Your mama was right.

1:05:53.514 --> 1:05:55.038
Well, I'm in trouble.

1:06:09.052 --> 1:06:11.141
How much for all night?

1:06:12.533 --> 1:06:13.926
How long has she had
you in that basement?

1:06:14.013 --> 1:06:15.362
Over 10 years.

1:06:15.449 --> 1:06:17.712
Damn.

1:06:17.799 --> 1:06:20.063
We're gonna do
somethin' about it.

1:06:20.150 --> 1:06:22.413
Thank you so much, Officer.

1:06:22.500 --> 1:06:24.676
I tell you, this woman is evil.

1:06:24.763 --> 1:06:26.547
You have no idea the
kind of stuff she does.

1:06:26.678 --> 1:06:27.984
She...

1:06:28.114 --> 1:06:29.115
She won't even
feed us, you know?

1:06:29.246 --> 1:06:31.117
Like,
This is nothin'.

1:06:31.204 --> 1:06:32.684
Those other girls
you saw, they're--

1:06:32.771 --> 1:06:34.120
they're in the basement too.

1:06:36.731 --> 1:06:39.691
Where...
Where are you going?

1:06:44.130 --> 1:06:46.437
You said we was goin'
to the police station.

1:06:46.524 --> 1:06:48.830
We, we back in my neighborhood.

1:06:51.616 --> 1:06:53.531
No, this is--
This is the wrong way!

1:06:53.661 --> 1:06:55.011
No!

1:06:55.141 --> 1:06:57.361
You said you would
take me and help me!

1:06:57.448 --> 1:06:58.666
No, please!

1:06:58.753 --> 1:07:00.233
Get up!

1:07:00.364 --> 1:07:01.321
Please don't
leave me back here!

1:07:01.452 --> 1:07:03.193
-Shut up!
-Please don't...

1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:05.238
You the police!
You supposed to help me!

1:07:14.073 --> 1:07:16.075
You said your system was tight.

1:07:16.206 --> 1:07:18.860
It is.

1:07:18.947 --> 1:07:21.124
Trust it'll never
happen again.

1:07:21.254 --> 1:07:22.777
I'm not takin' you at your word.

1:07:22.864 --> 1:07:24.649
Prove it.

1:07:26.477 --> 1:07:28.566
Chris, go get the others.

1:07:28.696 --> 1:07:30.220
Okay.

1:07:45.365 --> 1:07:47.585
Y'all need to see.

1:07:51.850 --> 1:07:54.592
This is what happens when
you try to leave this house.

1:07:56.942 --> 1:07:59.249
Or talk about what
goes on in this house.

1:08:02.861 --> 1:08:04.471
Let me tell you something.

1:08:04.558 --> 1:08:06.386
I know everything.

1:08:06.473 --> 1:08:09.955
I'm everywhere.
I'm god in this house!

1:08:11.609 --> 1:08:13.132
Pastor--

1:08:13.219 --> 1:08:14.655
Get your ass up!
Get your ass up!

1:08:14.742 --> 1:08:16.265
Put her in the attic.

1:08:17.745 --> 1:08:19.094
Take off her damn clothes.

1:08:19.182 --> 1:08:21.009
I don't want to
waste no good dress

1:08:21.096 --> 1:08:22.576
on no beat-up bitch.

1:08:24.273 --> 1:08:25.274
Does our word mean
something now?

1:08:27.233 --> 1:08:30.628
Yeah. I'm convinced.

1:08:30.715 --> 1:08:32.846
Run the damn ball, boy!

1:08:32.978 --> 1:08:35.719
I'm gonna go ahead on
and head out to the store.

1:08:35.807 --> 1:08:38.417
I'll be back in about an hour.

1:08:38.505 --> 1:08:41.203
All right, baby.
Be careful.

1:08:50.300 --> 1:08:51.779
Hey, man.

1:08:56.958 --> 1:08:58.830
Sassy little bitch.

1:09:00.832 --> 1:09:02.486
Hey, bring me a beer!

1:09:03.922 --> 1:09:05.402
And hurry up.

1:09:14.193 --> 1:09:15.585
I said hurry up!

1:10:07.072 --> 1:10:08.465
Nancy...

1:10:14.818 --> 1:10:16.821
My god, it's so hot in here.

1:10:16.907 --> 1:10:18.214
Nancy...

1:10:19.693 --> 1:10:21.085
Here.

1:10:41.106 --> 1:10:42.541
C-Cam...

1:10:43.630 --> 1:10:44.936
Don't come back.

1:10:46.807 --> 1:10:48.112
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:11:01.039 --> 1:11:02.606
We good to go for tonight.

1:11:04.564 --> 1:11:05.957
What's the 411 on Nancy?

1:11:08.046 --> 1:11:09.960
You got the policeman and about
five other men askin' about her.

1:11:12.137 --> 1:11:13.617
You're missin' out on
a whole lot of money.

1:11:19.927 --> 1:11:21.451
I guess she been up
there long enough.

1:11:23.496 --> 1:11:25.281
Cameron?

1:11:30.198 --> 1:11:32.026
Go on up there and help
Nancy get cleaned up

1:11:32.112 --> 1:11:33.289
and ready for work.

1:11:37.554 --> 1:11:38.294
Nancy, they're letting you--

1:11:42.514 --> 1:11:43.821
Nancy?

1:11:46.563 --> 1:11:48.565
No... No...

1:11:48.652 --> 1:11:50.044
Nancy!

1:11:50.175 --> 1:11:51.394
Nancy, please!

1:11:51.523 --> 1:11:53.483
No, no, no, no!

1:11:53.570 --> 1:11:55.833
Nancy, wake up!

1:11:55.920 --> 1:11:58.052
Wake up, please!

1:11:58.139 --> 1:12:00.098
No!

1:12:00.228 --> 1:12:02.100
No, Nancy, please!

1:12:02.187 --> 1:12:03.406
Damn.

1:12:03.493 --> 1:12:05.712
Please, Nancy, no!

1:12:05.799 --> 1:12:07.018
No!

1:12:07.105 --> 1:12:08.280
What the hell
are you yelling about?

1:12:08.411 --> 1:12:10.064
Nancy! She won't wake up!

1:12:10.195 --> 1:12:11.457
Girl, shut up!

1:12:11.544 --> 1:12:12.719
What we gonna do?

1:12:12.850 --> 1:12:14.678
That policeman
ain't gonna save us now.

1:12:14.808 --> 1:12:15.635
-Okay--
-You need to fix this!

1:12:15.722 --> 1:12:17.115
Everybody shut up!

1:12:17.202 --> 1:12:18.638
Uh uh, I ain't signed
up for any of this.

1:12:18.725 --> 1:12:19.857
-Hell no!
-Pastor!

1:12:21.989 --> 1:12:23.861
You said that when
I tell you to jump,

1:12:23.991 --> 1:12:25.906
you weren't gonna
ask me how high.

1:12:25.993 --> 1:12:27.559
That's what you told me.

1:12:27.647 --> 1:12:30.258
So don't start askin' now.

1:12:30.389 --> 1:12:32.173
Now, get the others,
pack up the whole house.

1:12:32.260 --> 1:12:33.871
We gotta go.

1:12:36.134 --> 1:12:36.916
Fix this, babe.

1:12:37.004 --> 1:12:38.049
I got it.

1:12:40.138 --> 1:12:41.443
Get your ass up and come on.

1:12:41.574 --> 1:12:43.707
What about Nancy?

1:12:45.056 --> 1:12:46.362
What about her?

1:12:47.624 --> 1:12:49.365
I said get downstairs and pack.

1:12:51.715 --> 1:12:53.193
Don't make me ask you again.

1:12:54.021 --> 1:12:55.371
Now!

1:13:08.035 --> 1:13:09.341
Okay, come on, y'all.

1:13:09.428 --> 1:13:10.821
Chris, grab my good
pillows over there, baby.

1:13:10.907 --> 1:13:12.388
Don't drop that VCR.

1:13:12.475 --> 1:13:13.606
Go on, take it over there.

1:13:13.693 --> 1:13:15.347
Pastor, come on with
the baby's toys!

1:13:15.434 --> 1:13:16.653
It don't take that long!

1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:18.698
Cameron!

1:13:18.785 --> 1:13:20.657
Hurry up!

1:13:20.744 --> 1:13:22.963
And don't break
my damn computer!

1:13:23.050 --> 1:13:24.008
Come on, baby,
grab these clothes.

1:13:24.138 --> 1:13:26.184
Come on, here we go.

1:13:26.271 --> 1:13:29.187
Pastor, come on, now, come on!

1:13:29.273 --> 1:13:30.884
Cameron, be gentle with that.

1:13:30.971 --> 1:13:33.757
You break that computer,
I'ma break your ass.

1:13:33.844 --> 1:13:34.932
Come on, y'all. Here we go.

1:13:37.630 --> 1:13:39.589
Hey, take those bags
upstairs for me.

1:13:42.112 --> 1:13:43.767
Ma, let me show
you the basement.

1:14:04.178 --> 1:14:05.963
It ain't really
much of a basement.

1:14:06.050 --> 1:14:07.965
And the manager's strict.

1:14:08.052 --> 1:14:10.315
Don't want anything down
here, not even no animals.

1:14:10.402 --> 1:14:12.143
So they can't stay long.

1:14:12.230 --> 1:14:14.580
Yeah, well, we'll
be out of your hair

1:14:14.666 --> 1:14:16.321
once we find a place of our own.

1:14:18.323 --> 1:14:20.630
There's not enough space
down here for all of us.

1:14:20.717 --> 1:14:22.588
Don't worry.

1:14:22.719 --> 1:14:24.634
I got the perfect spot for you.

1:14:42.652 --> 1:14:43.957
Get in.

1:14:44.044 --> 1:14:46.046
No, please.

1:14:46.133 --> 1:14:48.092
Girl, get in before
I get my BB gun.

1:14:48.179 --> 1:14:49.833
Why are you doing this?

1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:52.618
Because you weak.

1:14:52.705 --> 1:14:54.490
You don't even know what
it takes to survive.

1:14:54.577 --> 1:14:57.318
And you do?

1:14:57.405 --> 1:14:59.407
In this life, you either
taken from somebody

1:14:59.495 --> 1:15:01.279
or they taken from you.

1:15:01.366 --> 1:15:04.717
I do what I gotta do to make it.

1:15:04.804 --> 1:15:08.286
I held this family down
when your grandma died!

1:15:08.416 --> 1:15:10.375
And what thanks do I get?

1:15:10.505 --> 1:15:11.985
Nothing.

1:15:12.072 --> 1:15:14.771
The disrespect.

1:15:14.901 --> 1:15:18.514
Through all the beatings,
the rape, the jail time...

1:15:20.820 --> 1:15:22.213
I was always there
for the family.

1:15:24.824 --> 1:15:26.870
But it wasn't enough.

1:15:26.957 --> 1:15:30.743
So forget them.

1:15:30.830 --> 1:15:33.833
But your ass is weak.

1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:36.270
And I'ma make it strong like me.

1:15:36.357 --> 1:15:39.012
Like you?

1:15:39.143 --> 1:15:40.405
I'll never be like you!

1:15:42.362 --> 1:15:43.364
No!

1:15:43.451 --> 1:15:45.062
No, please!

1:15:54.853 --> 1:15:57.727
Aunt Mia, please!

1:15:57.814 --> 1:16:00.164
Auntie Mia!

1:16:00.251 --> 1:16:03.166
Please, Auntie Mia, don't--

1:16:03.254 --> 1:16:05.038
Auntie Mia, let me out!

1:16:44.121 --> 1:16:47.210
You gettin' a little too
comfortable in here.

1:16:47.298 --> 1:16:48.952
We're family now.

1:16:50.693 --> 1:16:52.216
Dang, Ma!

1:16:52.303 --> 1:16:53.696
Elijah is upstairs sleeping.

1:16:53.782 --> 1:16:56.089
Can't you take that outside?

1:16:56.175 --> 1:16:57.612
Girl, shut up.
Don't tell me what to do.

1:17:00.485 --> 1:17:01.791
Good riddance.

1:17:05.882 --> 1:17:07.318
Any luck?

1:17:07.448 --> 1:17:08.841
No.

1:17:08.928 --> 1:17:10.277
Nothing with a
basement big enough.

1:17:10.364 --> 1:17:12.758
Yeah, and that
basement is too small.

1:17:12.889 --> 1:17:15.195
It stinks to high hell.

1:17:15.326 --> 1:17:17.327
Neighbors gonna cause a
fuss one of these days.

1:17:17.415 --> 1:17:19.547
Don't you think I know that?

1:17:19.635 --> 1:17:21.549
What we can do is
probably air the basement out

1:17:21.637 --> 1:17:23.377
and even let them get some air.

1:17:23.464 --> 1:17:26.032
Maybe that could buy us
some time.

1:17:26.119 --> 1:17:27.512
What about your niece?

1:17:28.731 --> 1:17:30.166
Man, it gotta be
100 degrees in there.

1:17:30.297 --> 1:17:34.432
She ain't had no food
or water in three days.

1:17:34.519 --> 1:17:36.608
It's almost like
you're trying to kill the girl.

1:17:38.001 --> 1:17:40.003
Our Father
in the heavens,

1:17:40.090 --> 1:17:42.919
let Your name be sanctified.

1:17:43.049 --> 1:17:45.573
Let Your Kingdom come.

1:17:45.704 --> 1:17:48.141
Let Your will take place

1:17:48.272 --> 1:17:50.448
as in Heaven, on earth.

1:17:52.450 --> 1:17:54.191
Am I dead?

1:18:33.577 --> 1:18:34.884
All right, thank you for this.

1:18:35.014 --> 1:18:38.061
And, uh...it will
clear this time?

1:18:38.191 --> 1:18:39.452
Yes.

1:18:39.540 --> 1:18:40.759
All right, well,
thank you very much.

1:18:40.846 --> 1:18:41.978
Take care.

1:18:42.108 --> 1:18:43.936
Oh, you know, one more thing?

1:18:44.067 --> 1:18:45.416
We got some complaints
from the neighbors

1:18:45.503 --> 1:18:46.809
about some of the
smells around here.

1:18:46.896 --> 1:18:48.201
I want to make sure there's

1:18:48.288 --> 1:18:49.507
no pets, no dogs,
no nothin', right?

1:18:49.637 --> 1:18:51.683
I know the rules.

1:18:51.814 --> 1:18:53.946
We don't have any pets.

1:18:54.077 --> 1:18:55.425
- All right. Take care.
- You too.

1:18:55.513 --> 1:18:56.601
All right.

1:19:33.986 --> 1:19:35.814
Oh, god!

1:19:35.945 --> 1:19:37.337
Oh!

1:19:37.424 --> 1:19:38.904
What?

1:19:38.991 --> 1:19:39.775
Ugh, I knew it.

1:19:44.257 --> 1:19:45.389
Come on out!

1:19:45.519 --> 1:19:46.651
Come on out!

1:19:46.782 --> 1:19:47.782
Come on out!

1:19:51.438 --> 1:19:53.223
Oh my god...

1:20:00.317 --> 1:20:01.318
911,
what's your emergency?

1:20:03.362 --> 1:20:05.670
-Police!
-Police!

1:20:05.800 --> 1:20:07.889
Clear?

1:20:08.020 --> 1:20:09.978
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1:20:11.502 --> 1:20:12.895
What the hell are you doing?

1:20:12.982 --> 1:20:14.374
You can't go in
when you don't have a warrant!

1:20:14.505 --> 1:20:15.332
Get off of me!
You're hurting me!

1:20:17.377 --> 1:20:18.422
Police!

1:20:19.597 --> 1:20:21.642
Get down, ma'am!
Get down!

1:20:21.728 --> 1:20:24.254
Hey, get your hands
off of her, man!

1:20:24.384 --> 1:20:25.995
Calm down! Calm down!

1:20:26.734 --> 1:20:28.084
No!

1:20:28.214 --> 1:20:29.433
Don't touch her!

1:20:31.522 --> 1:20:32.523
Stop touching her like that!

1:20:32.610 --> 1:20:33.916
Stay calm.

1:20:41.314 --> 1:20:43.664
Oh my god.
We found her.

1:20:46.145 --> 1:20:48.452
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

1:20:48.582 --> 1:20:50.323
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:20:50.454 --> 1:20:52.630
I promise.

1:20:52.717 --> 1:20:54.850
Come on.

1:20:58.679 --> 1:21:00.725
You got it.

1:21:04.642 --> 1:21:07.036
You're fine.
I got you.

1:21:07.123 --> 1:21:08.907
It's all right.

1:21:09.038 --> 1:21:10.561
Here we go.

1:21:10.648 --> 1:21:12.780
What's your name, hon?

1:21:12.911 --> 1:21:14.782
I want my mom.

1:21:14.870 --> 1:21:17.394
We'll call your
mom, don't worry.

1:21:17.481 --> 1:21:18.960
Thank you.

1:21:19.048 --> 1:21:20.484
Let's go.

1:21:22.529 --> 1:21:23.879
Cleared out.

1:21:47.684 --> 1:21:50.514
Our Father in the heavens,

1:21:50.601 --> 1:21:53.473
let Your name be sanctified.

1:21:53.559 --> 1:21:56.172
Let Your kingdom come...

1:21:56.302 --> 1:21:58.739
Let Your will take place

1:21:58.826 --> 1:22:00.916
--as in Heaven,
also on earth.

1:22:06.922 --> 1:22:09.184
Mama?

1:22:33.992 --> 1:22:39.432
Next on the docket,
we have Mrs. Mia Smith.

1:22:39.519 --> 1:22:43.262
For the record, please
state your name.

1:22:43.393 --> 1:22:45.351
Mia Smith.

1:22:45.482 --> 1:22:47.788
At this time, you may
explain to the board

1:22:47.875 --> 1:22:49.573
why you're suitable
for early parole.

1:22:51.053 --> 1:22:54.230
I didn't have a easy life.

1:22:54.317 --> 1:22:58.451
I was abused by my own mother
and by others in my family.

1:23:00.366 --> 1:23:03.195
I did what I...

1:23:03.282 --> 1:23:04.501
could do to survive.

1:23:05.763 --> 1:23:08.200
Yeah, I did wrong.

1:23:08.287 --> 1:23:10.855
But I learned my lesson.

1:23:10.986 --> 1:23:13.945
I got help.

1:23:14.032 --> 1:23:15.991
And now I know that I
hurt a lot of people.

1:23:19.298 --> 1:23:20.778
I'm sorry.

1:23:23.172 --> 1:23:27.741
And I know that if you
give me another chance,

1:23:27.871 --> 1:23:30.005
I can be a productive
member of society.

1:23:34.052 --> 1:23:35.880
Thank you for listening
to my petition.

1:23:42.147 --> 1:23:43.366
Thank you, Ms. Smith.

1:23:46.585 --> 1:23:49.415
If there's anyone else
who wishes to speak,

1:23:49.502 --> 1:23:50.895
you may do so now.

1:23:53.637 --> 1:23:55.117
Thank you.

1:23:55.204 --> 1:23:56.727
For the record, your name is?

1:23:58.076 --> 1:24:00.469
Cameron Smith.

1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:01.949
Thank you, Miss Smith.

1:24:02.037 --> 1:24:03.951
What would you like to say?

1:24:04.082 --> 1:24:06.780
You once told me

1:24:06.911 --> 1:24:11.219
that you held down the
family after Grandma died.

1:24:11.307 --> 1:24:14.832
But you don't know
what family means.

1:24:14.919 --> 1:24:16.834
Family looks out for each other.

1:24:16.964 --> 1:24:20.664
They care for each other.

1:24:20.751 --> 1:24:21.882
Family doesn't hurt each other.

1:24:25.277 --> 1:24:29.193
They don't...hold
each other captive,

1:24:29.281 --> 1:24:31.501
rape,

1:24:31.588 --> 1:24:34.156
torture,

1:24:34.243 --> 1:24:36.419
or force each other into
sexual acts with strangers.

1:24:40.945 --> 1:24:45.471
You said you did
those things to me

1:24:45.558 --> 1:24:48.039
to make me strong.

1:24:51.521 --> 1:24:52.609
Well, I'm stronger than you.

1:24:55.133 --> 1:24:56.960
And I won't hurt others
the way that you hurt me.

1:24:59.877 --> 1:25:01.096
You're evil.

1:25:03.141 --> 1:25:04.708
And you don't
deserve to be free.

1:25:08.886 --> 1:25:09.626
Thank you.

1:25:10.540 --> 1:25:11.802
Thank you.
