Would you risk walking along
a precipice so steep

your loved one again?

from love's greatness?

is that it can do
all those things.

that mist could give Shivani

Yes.

10:19.227 --> 10:20.663
if you're willing.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.714
All plants have a
circulatory system

10:27.757 --> 10:29.454
that pulls nutrients
from the soil.

10:29.498 --> 10:30.934
If there's fuel

10:30.978 --> 10:32.980
in the fruit, there's got
to be fuel in the roots.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.808
And when I find those,

10:34.851 --> 10:37.071
I'm-a cook us up
some alien biodiesel.

10:37.114 --> 10:39.464
When did you become
a plant daddy?

10:39.508 --> 10:41.771
Sanders and I don't grow
prize-winning sunflowers

10:41.815 --> 10:43.991
every year on sheer luck
and sunshine, baby.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.383
BONNIE:
I don't know how
you guys are joking

10:45.427 --> 10:47.603
right now when there's
a typhoon coming.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.692
I think you mean tornado.

10:49.736 --> 10:50.824
Well, whatever it is,
it makes me feel like

10:50.867 --> 10:52.695
I'm digging my own grave.

10:52.739 --> 10:56.307
Why couldn't Theo make it rain,
like, cherry cola or something?

10:56.351 --> 10:58.005
I don't know, there's bound
to be a margin of error

10:58.048 --> 11:00.311
when you create
an entire pocket dimension.

11:00.355 --> 11:03.010
Ugh, how are you always
so positive?

11:03.053 --> 11:05.795
I think I just keep focused
on, you know,

11:05.839 --> 11:07.318
the little things.

11:07.362 --> 11:10.626
Like that perfect pour
of bourbon from Maria

11:10.670 --> 11:13.803
or, uh, Tragic Magicon vinyl.

11:13.847 --> 11:17.111
Ooh, a long, hot shower
with the man you love.

11:17.154 --> 11:18.416
BONNIE:
Well, you know,

11:18.460 --> 11:20.767
dreaming of Shatner Shakes

11:20.810 --> 11:22.116
and curly fries
won't cut it for me.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.813
It's all just
a distraction

11:23.857 --> 11:25.641
from the one thing
I've known my entire life,

11:25.685 --> 11:28.731
that there is always something
lurking in the shadows.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.952
And today it looks like that.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.738
ALEX:
She's right, you know.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.175
In Afghanistan, thoughts of home

11:38.219 --> 11:40.482
can keep you going or they can
become your worst enemy.

11:40.525 --> 11:43.833
Sometimes the best way
to conquer your fear is to just

11:43.877 --> 11:46.706
see the situation
for what it is.

11:49.012 --> 11:52.799
Well, I think I'd prefer
bourbon and cherry cola.

11:54.104 --> 11:55.236
Good.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.543
'Cause I just found some.

11:58.587 --> 12:02.156
Everything in the universe
is held together by energy.

12:02.199 --> 12:05.507
Once you trust your strength,
you can use the flame

12:05.550 --> 12:07.988
to manipulate matter
at the subatomic level.

12:08.031 --> 12:09.729
And restore
this fence

12:09.772 --> 12:11.426
to what it was before.

12:11.469 --> 12:14.603
What if my strength and my fear
come from the same person?

12:14.646 --> 12:18.389
Acknowledge you're afraid
and then let it go.

12:18.433 --> 12:21.262
Facing your smaller fears
will help you conquer

12:21.305 --> 12:22.742
the larger ones.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.179
Let's try
fixing the fence

12:25.222 --> 12:27.616
with your sister
standing next to you.

12:27.659 --> 12:30.227
Was I just classified
as small?

12:33.840 --> 12:36.059
Visualize the
fence as it was,

12:36.103 --> 12:38.714
and allow Liz to
give you strength

12:38.758 --> 12:40.934
instead of to
take it from you.

12:52.467 --> 12:53.816
[laughs softly]

13:00.954 --> 13:02.694
It's like someone
drilled a hole in my head

13:02.738 --> 13:04.000
and the science fell out.

13:04.044 --> 13:06.133
It's an amino,

13:06.176 --> 13:08.439
but what is the J? J...

13:08.483 --> 13:10.093
ROSA:Since when do you
need the Internet

13:10.137 --> 13:13.009
to understand science?It's just a refresher.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.881
Are you sure you're okay?
Here, drink some of this.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.230
I'm fine. Rosa, please.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.275
Look, recovery can be
a roller coaster.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.451
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I just, I--

13:20.495 --> 13:22.453
you're hovering like
a comadre chismosaright now,

13:22.497 --> 13:25.108
and I don't need a sponsor
in this moment.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.109
Well, what do you need, then?

13:26.153 --> 13:28.024
Time. Time I don't have,

13:28.068 --> 13:30.244
to-to figure this
all out, it's...

13:31.811 --> 13:33.769
Okay.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.727
[mutters]

13:35.771 --> 13:38.121
[sighs]

13:38.165 --> 13:40.471
Maybe I should run some tests.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.212
If you're
forgetting things,

13:42.256 --> 13:43.648
then let's find out what...

13:43.692 --> 13:45.172
This. This right here.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.087
This is the amino acid

13:47.130 --> 13:48.610
that controls Bonnie's powers.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.133
Did it just take you four hours
to recognize

13:50.177 --> 13:52.048
a gene you weaponized
a few weeks ago?

13:52.092 --> 13:54.616
The important question is,
why is Bonnie's DNA

13:54.659 --> 13:56.313
a part of Shivani's formula?

13:56.357 --> 13:59.360
Bonnie's power mutes abilities.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.710
Add that to the
cyclophosphamide...

14:01.753 --> 14:03.538
[exhales]

14:03.581 --> 14:06.323
You're thinking Shivani
found a way to neutralize

14:06.367 --> 14:08.760
the Ophiuchus brand
by using Bonnie's DNA.

14:08.804 --> 14:11.328
Which means Clyde
is not after Max.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.723
At least,
not until he gets Bonnie.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.029
[Michael grunts]

14:16.899 --> 14:18.901
Oh, yeah.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.511
Time to make some borscht.

14:20.555 --> 14:23.514
Uh, so are we done here?
Could we go back inside now?

14:23.558 --> 14:26.866
CLYDE:
I believe we're just
getting started.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.956
[grunting]

14:33.263 --> 14:34.656
We've got some
catching up to do.

14:41.402 --> 14:44.535
[sighs] Maria still hasn't
made contact with Alex.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.320
All right, I-I'm going in.
I have to warn them.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.800
I mean, for all we know,
Clyde might already have Bonnie.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.628
Yeah, but what if you run into
Clyde before you find Michael?

14:50.672 --> 14:53.153
I won't let you face him
alone in... Hadestown.

14:53.196 --> 14:54.502
MAX:
She won't.

14:54.545 --> 14:55.590
I'm going with her.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.113
LIZ:
But y-you just
started training.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.549
What-what if you get
trapped down there?

14:58.593 --> 15:00.116
ISOBEL:Listen, all
Michael needs

15:00.160 --> 15:01.248
to open that portal
is fuel, right?

15:01.291 --> 15:02.640
And he was
pretty confident

15:02.684 --> 15:04.164
that he'd be able
to find it down there.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.210
That-that is
what Michael said, right?

15:07.254 --> 15:09.430
Sure, but we all know
Michael leaps

15:09.473 --> 15:10.692
before he looks.

15:10.735 --> 15:11.693
You guys, we are not gonna risk

15:11.736 --> 15:13.042
any more lives on a maybe.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.870
Hey, we won't.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.741
Right? You can just...

15:16.785 --> 15:18.178
science up some fuel here.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.180
You sure you're ready for this?

15:20.223 --> 15:23.357
Tezca said that I need
to face my fears

15:23.400 --> 15:25.098
to master the flame, so...

15:26.012 --> 15:27.927
...I got to do this.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.146
Uh, wait, wait...

15:30.190 --> 15:31.843
It's just, wha-what if you
don't come back?

15:31.887 --> 15:33.497
I will.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.110
In the history of this planet,

15:37.153 --> 15:40.069
Liz Ortecho has never failed
at the science.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.158
Okay?

15:42.202 --> 15:44.073
I'm not running anymore.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.295
All those awful things I said to
you when I was high on the mist,

15:48.338 --> 15:50.427
you know that those
weren't true.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.125
You know

15:52.168 --> 15:53.865
you don't hold me back, right?

15:53.909 --> 15:55.345
All of the good things
I've done,

15:55.389 --> 15:57.957
all of my best discoveries,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.089
it's because
you've been by my side.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.048
You don't have to tell me that.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.702
I... I do.

16:04.746 --> 16:06.704
I might forget later.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.490
Then I'll remind you.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.539
I mean, it's just classic me,

16:15.583 --> 16:17.628
you know, to not...
just talk straight with you

16:17.672 --> 16:20.283
until I have to walk
into a pit of sand.

16:21.676 --> 16:23.373
Oh, God.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.469
Oh.

16:36.430 --> 16:37.648
[gasps]

16:40.260 --> 16:42.566
Since when have
you two been a thing?

16:42.610 --> 16:43.611
Um...

16:43.654 --> 16:45.613
You know, Liz, uh...

16:47.571 --> 16:49.051
...it's been
a long time coming.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.357
[soft laughter]

16:50.400 --> 16:52.185
Okay.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.015
You ready?

16:56.058 --> 16:58.713
Yeah. Let's do it.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.510
[wind whooshing]

17:13.554 --> 17:15.991
[grunting]

17:16.035 --> 17:17.471
We need to find Bonnie.

17:17.514 --> 17:20.343
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dallas
is out there now, all right?

17:20.387 --> 17:23.085
I'm gonna get
started on the fuel.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.218
But he can't
take on Clyde alone.

17:26.219 --> 17:28.090
Every minute in this hellhole

17:28.134 --> 17:30.223
is like being
in a microwave for you.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.225
And since I cannot be
in two places at once,

17:32.268 --> 17:33.574
it's gonna have to do
for now, okay?

17:33.617 --> 17:35.489
It's like The Grapes of Drab
out there.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.752
What are you two doing here?Hey.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.406
[scoffs]

17:39.449 --> 17:41.364
Real Roswell
isn't dangerous enough?

17:41.408 --> 17:42.844
I think that what he means

17:42.887 --> 17:43.845
is "Thank God,

17:43.888 --> 17:45.194
we really need help."

17:45.238 --> 17:46.935
ISOBEL:
It's so good to see you, Alex.

17:46.978 --> 17:48.763
So I'm guessing, uh,

17:48.806 --> 17:50.852
Clyde kidnapped
our little space-cult runaway?

17:50.895 --> 17:52.941
All right, well, Iz and
I will go after him.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.986
I appreciate the moxie,
but what do you plan to do?

17:55.030 --> 17:56.466
You gonna arrest the alien?

17:57.424 --> 17:59.252
I did bring your handcuffs.

17:59.295 --> 18:02.081
Got another surprise
for you, too.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.218
Way to bury the lede.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.742
If the fuel is in the fruit,

18:11.786 --> 18:14.876
then it's got to exist
in other parts of the tree.

18:14.919 --> 18:17.400
But since we won't be able
to tell which parts

18:17.444 --> 18:20.273
until we get to the lab,
how about you tell me

18:20.316 --> 18:22.623
how long you've been
kissing Isobel Evans?

18:22.666 --> 18:24.146
[laughs]

18:24.190 --> 18:25.539
I'll tell you that
if you tell me

18:25.582 --> 18:27.454
how long you've been
forgetting things.

18:28.629 --> 18:32.937
You can lie to Max,
but you can't lie to me.

18:32.981 --> 18:35.462
[scoffs]

18:35.505 --> 18:37.116
I noticed when you noticed.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.595
Hmm.

18:38.639 --> 18:40.336
But I couldn't tell Max
because he's finally ready

18:40.380 --> 18:42.643
to step into who he is,

18:42.686 --> 18:44.253
and I'm not gonna stand
in the way of that.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.516
It's all fun and games
dating an alien

18:46.560 --> 18:48.431
until they got to save
the universe, huh?

18:48.475 --> 18:50.781
We have to figure out a way
to get them back, Kyle.

18:50.825 --> 18:53.523
Oh, trust me when I say there is
nothing that I want more.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.917
But memory lapses
are a big deal, Liz.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.614
We got to check and
make sure that mist

18:57.658 --> 18:59.138
hasn't done
any permanent damage.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.314
Okay, after we get the fuel.

19:01.357 --> 19:04.012
Look, I will gladly take a nap

19:04.055 --> 19:05.318
in your imaging machine,
I promise.

19:05.361 --> 19:08.190
I just... I feel great.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.800
So, please,
let's figure this out

19:09.844 --> 19:11.846
while combustion
is still clear in my mind.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.156
Fine.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.114
Okay.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.855
[closes hatchback]

19:21.682 --> 19:23.901
SONYA:
Are you comfortable?

19:23.945 --> 19:25.294
How's your heart monitor?

19:25.338 --> 19:26.643
Uh, I can barely feel it.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.819
Now, how do you know
so much about this?

19:28.863 --> 19:30.604
I obviously don't know
that much,

19:30.647 --> 19:32.519
because this is our third try.

19:32.562 --> 19:35.652
Well, I feel like we're
getting closer, so thank you.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.611
You can thank my dad
when he gets here.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.352
He spent most of my childhood
here at Deep Sky,

19:39.395 --> 19:44.139
so I spent most of my time
hacking their computers.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.445
To get back at him?

19:46.315 --> 19:48.012
To figure out
what was so special

19:48.056 --> 19:51.146
about this place that my dad
would choose it over me.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.453
And remote viewing
just happened

19:53.496 --> 19:55.846
to be my favorite subject.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.283
Did it ever work for you?

19:57.326 --> 19:59.546
You're assuming I tried it.

19:59.589 --> 20:00.851
Well, you know, smart kid

20:00.895 --> 20:03.593
whose father
made her feel abandoned?

20:03.637 --> 20:04.986
I just connected the dots.

20:05.029 --> 20:08.381
I never felt abandoned.

20:08.424 --> 20:09.730
It was more that

20:09.773 --> 20:13.124
when I was with him,
I felt safe.

20:13.168 --> 20:14.517
Must have been

20:14.561 --> 20:16.911
the space spy thing
he had going.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.522
You didn't answer the question.

20:19.566 --> 20:23.265
Okay, once I might have gotten
into the same room as him,

20:23.309 --> 20:26.225
but it was so quick that...

20:27.226 --> 20:28.836
Not awkward at all.

20:28.879 --> 20:34.842
Sorry about the whole, um,
stuffing you in a pod situation.

20:36.104 --> 20:39.499
Uh, Kyle thought I might be able
to look in on Max from here.

20:42.284 --> 20:43.764
Hug it out,

20:43.807 --> 20:44.939
take a seat.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.507
We're gonna go again.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.905
[exhales]

20:54.949 --> 20:56.255
[thunder rumbling]

20:57.865 --> 21:00.520
You risked rotting down here
for a blood sample?

21:01.347 --> 21:02.739
Have you ever wondered why

21:02.783 --> 21:05.481
the mark of Ophiuchus
never took on you?

21:06.439 --> 21:08.397
Jones said I wasn't
special enough.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.486
CLYDE:
He lied.

21:11.357 --> 21:13.750
It's because you're too special.

21:14.534 --> 21:16.753
Your ability rejected

21:16.797 --> 21:19.930
the alien glass that our
savior put in this mark.

21:19.974 --> 21:25.545
And now that ability
is gonna do the same for me.

21:28.199 --> 21:29.636
[exhales]

21:29.679 --> 21:31.942
And in a few hours,

21:31.986 --> 21:33.683
this brand will be gone.

21:33.727 --> 21:37.470
And as soon as I reconfigure
the map back in Roswell proper,

21:37.513 --> 21:41.125
we can finally go back to Oasis.

21:41.169 --> 21:42.301
We?

21:42.344 --> 21:43.693
Of course.

21:43.737 --> 21:46.130
I have been miserable
since what happened.

21:46.174 --> 21:48.437
Earthquakes happen, Clyde.

21:48.481 --> 21:51.005
You pushed me into hell
and left me for dead.

21:51.048 --> 21:52.311
Think of how I felt,

21:52.354 --> 21:55.052
watching you fall
prey to Michael.

21:57.620 --> 22:01.320
All I've ever wanted
was to protect you.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.799
Don't you want
to go back

22:02.843 --> 22:04.845
to the way things
used to be?

22:04.888 --> 22:06.586
When it was just us?

22:06.629 --> 22:07.978
Bonnie and Clyde?

22:08.022 --> 22:09.980
There is no us anymore.Bonnie, stop.

22:10.024 --> 22:11.373
You're my sister.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.809
I love you.

22:12.853 --> 22:15.029
You don't even know
what that means.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.988
You can't force people
to love you, Clyde.

22:18.032 --> 22:19.990
I know you're afraid
of feeling like

22:20.034 --> 22:21.340
that kid in the gutter again,
but you...

22:21.383 --> 22:23.037
I don't have to force anyone.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.170
As soon as I take our savior's
throne, our people will have

22:26.214 --> 22:27.998
everything they ever wanted.

22:28.042 --> 22:29.478
Security,

22:29.522 --> 22:31.437
singularity of focus,

22:31.480 --> 22:34.222
and Ophiuchun philosophy
to unite us.

22:35.266 --> 22:39.836
They will worship me,
'cause if they don't...

22:39.880 --> 22:40.881
You'll what?

22:47.844 --> 22:50.717
It's already starting to fade.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.333
[grunting]

22:58.942 --> 23:00.596
I won't let you destroy
my home planet that way.

23:13.261 --> 23:14.871
Not bad for a clone.

23:20.573 --> 23:21.965
[panting]

23:34.891 --> 23:36.110
[sniffles]

23:52.518 --> 23:54.607
[crying]

23:55.390 --> 23:57.697
[thunder rumbling]

24:00.177 --> 24:01.744
The wind's getting stronger.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.703
No sign of Bonnie
or Clyde anywhere.

24:03.746 --> 24:05.269
Yeah, well, now you have backup.

24:05.313 --> 24:07.794
Max and Isobel decided
to join us in here.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.752
Maybe they will have
better luck.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.145
How's, uh, how's that fuel?

24:11.188 --> 24:12.973
Doesn't have much kick,

24:13.016 --> 24:14.670
but we are clearly running
out of time, so...

24:14.714 --> 24:17.020
You think it's enough
to get us through the portal?

24:17.064 --> 24:20.981
If, uh, Liz can whip up another
batch of this aboveground,

24:21.024 --> 24:23.374
I think we got a shot
at opening the portal.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.028
Alex, we're gonna need you
to get those instructions

24:25.072 --> 24:27.204
to our friendly neighborhood
medium, all right?

24:27.248 --> 24:30.643
Hey, uh, I don't know
if Alex is up for that.

24:34.647 --> 24:35.996
Hey.
Hey.

24:37.911 --> 24:39.303
He's burning up. Can you see

24:39.347 --> 24:41.044
if you can find
a first-aid kit or something?

24:41.088 --> 24:42.611
Yeah.Something to take
the fever down?

24:44.483 --> 24:46.528
Alex, drink.

24:48.835 --> 24:50.663
[coughing]Good.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.796
The storm's getting worse.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.886
I think that you need
to leave me behind.

24:58.192 --> 25:00.847
You refused to leave my side
when I went chasing after Jones.

25:00.890 --> 25:03.589
I am returning
the favor. Yes.

25:03.632 --> 25:05.808
The difference is,
we're not alone.

25:05.852 --> 25:08.724
If you wait for me,
then we risk everybody.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.857
Please, Michael,
stop trying

25:10.900 --> 25:12.815
to make decisions
with your heart right now.

25:12.859 --> 25:15.252
My heart is about to explode.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.646
You want to know
the truth?

25:17.690 --> 25:19.822
I am scared to death

25:19.866 --> 25:21.345
that I'm gonna lose you today.

25:22.216 --> 25:24.610
So, no, I'm not
throwing in the towel.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.002
Not now.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.830
No matter how many
times you ask me.

25:29.310 --> 25:31.225
So drink up, soldier.

25:35.621 --> 25:38.101
MARIA:
I can see Alex and Michael.

25:38.145 --> 25:40.016
They're in the Atomic Café,

25:40.060 --> 25:43.150
but it's during the Rapture.

25:43.193 --> 25:44.368
Pulse steady.

25:44.412 --> 25:45.674
Heart rate's strong.

25:45.718 --> 25:47.589
Say something.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.722
Try to make contact.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.028
I can't get close enough.

25:52.072 --> 25:55.336
Just imagine yourself
already there.

25:57.077 --> 26:00.123
Your imagination
must be better than mine. I...

26:00.167 --> 26:03.387
Maybe you're trying
to reach the wrong person.

26:03.431 --> 26:04.911
Have you tried
someone else?

26:04.954 --> 26:08.044
No. Alex is the only one
it's ever worked with.

26:08.088 --> 26:10.090
Is he the one
you're closest to?

26:18.185 --> 26:19.882
Whoa. Alex had me
thinking you were

26:19.926 --> 26:21.231
a telegraph,
not a teleport.

26:21.275 --> 26:23.625
How... how are
you doing this?

26:23.669 --> 26:25.279
I'll, uh... I'll explain later.

26:25.322 --> 26:26.410
Just tell me what you need.

26:26.454 --> 26:27.673
Did you find Alex?Yeah,

26:27.716 --> 26:28.674
but he's not
doing so hot.

26:28.717 --> 26:29.892
The atmosphere

26:29.936 --> 26:31.328
down here, it's
toxic to humans.

26:31.372 --> 26:32.547
We got to get him out.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.940
When do you need me
at the portal?

26:33.983 --> 26:36.072
As soon as Liz
can cook up some fuel.

26:36.116 --> 26:38.553
Guerin, he wrote
some instructions,

26:38.597 --> 26:39.859
but she's gonna
need tree root.

26:39.902 --> 26:40.903
I think she already has some.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.992
Good. I'll see you soon.

26:46.082 --> 26:47.649
I guess you can remember it?

26:48.781 --> 26:50.478
[clattering]

26:51.131 --> 26:53.176
What's happening?There's a storm down here.

26:53.220 --> 26:55.483
I think it might be starting
to destabilize the place.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.180
[clattering]

26:59.008 --> 27:01.794
[gasps] They're
on their way to the portal.

27:01.837 --> 27:02.838
Alex is sick.
There's a storm.

27:02.882 --> 27:03.926
I need a pen.

27:03.970 --> 27:05.624
Liz has to finish
the fuel.

27:05.667 --> 27:06.929
What kind of storm?

27:06.973 --> 27:08.452
A bad one. Flying monkeys bad.

27:08.496 --> 27:09.889
Everything is crumbling.

27:09.932 --> 27:11.107
When Theo was designing
the portal, he was

27:11.151 --> 27:12.892
adamant about
protecting it.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.459
I-I thought he created
the sinkhole as a prison,

27:15.503 --> 27:17.200
but maybe he did more than that?

27:17.244 --> 27:19.420
Guys, we need to get
this console to the portal now.

27:19.463 --> 27:20.551
What about Shivani's tail?

27:20.595 --> 27:21.552
If Shivani wants the console,

27:21.596 --> 27:22.771
she can come and get it.

27:22.815 --> 27:24.904
Okay, I'll get Liz
to work on the fuel.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.166
You should go with Maria.

27:26.209 --> 27:27.167
I can't.

27:27.689 --> 27:28.951
There's something
I need to do.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.780
[phone buzzing]

27:36.698 --> 27:38.526
Liz? Liz?

27:38.569 --> 27:39.875
Are you okay?

27:40.833 --> 27:41.747
ROSA:
Liz, what's going on?

27:41.790 --> 27:43.139
I can't remember.

27:43.183 --> 27:45.272
You told me
you were fine.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.796
I was worried
if I told you the truth,

27:47.840 --> 27:49.145
you wouldn't let me finish.

27:49.189 --> 27:50.669
All of our friends'
lives at stake.

27:50.712 --> 27:53.454
Y-You finally connecting
with Isobel.

27:53.497 --> 27:54.977
I couldn't turn away.

27:56.152 --> 27:58.328
I'm always expected...
[shudders]

27:58.372 --> 27:59.460
to come through.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.506
And I can't.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.204
My brain is broken.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.119
I don't recognizemyself.

28:06.162 --> 28:07.511
I...

28:07.555 --> 28:08.861
I can't...

28:08.904 --> 28:10.819
I can't figure out a way
to bring 'em back.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.560
Hey, hey, it's fine.

28:12.603 --> 28:14.083
It's okay.

28:14.127 --> 28:15.998
[sighs]

28:16.042 --> 28:17.696
If I...

28:17.739 --> 28:19.828
wasn't so focused
on Isobel, I...

28:19.872 --> 28:22.657
never would've let you
talk me out of examining you.Stop. Stop.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.833
I almost took it. The mist.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.617
You were right

28:26.661 --> 28:27.967
to be worried about me.No.

28:28.010 --> 28:30.404
No, you didn't
almost take it.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.581
Because I knew you couldn't
get into that cabinet.

28:33.624 --> 28:34.930
You know I'm weak.

28:34.974 --> 28:36.192
You're not weak.

28:36.236 --> 28:37.628
You just need
some support.

28:37.672 --> 28:39.674
Like all the
rest of us do.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.111
That's why I left
this morning.

28:42.155 --> 28:44.200
Because until you realize
that you need help,

28:44.244 --> 28:46.376
I'm not gonna be
of any use to you.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.770
[sniffling]

28:53.427 --> 28:55.385
I'm not gonna let...

28:55.429 --> 28:58.824
the thing that made me hurt
the people I love win.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.348
But I need to save our friends.

29:01.391 --> 29:03.089
[sniffles]

29:03.916 --> 29:05.961
And without the mist...
[sighs]

29:06.005 --> 29:08.050
there is only one way

29:08.094 --> 29:10.139
I can make that fuel.

29:12.838 --> 29:13.882
[sniffles]

29:13.926 --> 29:16.667
I promise to fill in the gaps

29:16.711 --> 29:18.626
until we figure out
how to fix you.

29:19.409 --> 29:22.761
Guerin was able
to write a recipe,

29:22.804 --> 29:24.371
and you were savvy enough
to go shopping.

29:24.414 --> 29:25.851
So...

29:25.894 --> 29:27.113
how about we
get started

29:27.156 --> 29:29.463
on this fuel
so Maria can get going?

29:30.420 --> 29:31.770
[grunts]

29:35.817 --> 29:37.688
[thunder cracks]

29:37.732 --> 29:39.299
Come on. I got you.

29:41.475 --> 29:42.563
You got it.

29:45.653 --> 29:47.655
I thought the plan was
to stay at the Crashdown!

29:47.698 --> 29:49.091
Yeah, it was,

29:49.135 --> 29:51.267
till the storm literally
caused it to crash down!

29:51.311 --> 29:52.486
CLYDE:No wonder
it's coming in

29:52.529 --> 29:53.835
so fast.

29:53.879 --> 29:54.967
There's two of you
idiots in here.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.446
What do you mean by that?

29:56.490 --> 29:57.926
I think Theo spelled it out
pretty clearly

29:57.970 --> 29:59.406
in his bible.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.190
I'm guessing the storm
started rolling in

30:01.234 --> 30:03.105
right when his
offspring showed up?

30:03.149 --> 30:05.978
Are you saying Jones's
DNA triggered the storm?

30:06.021 --> 30:08.458
Hey! Ten points
for the bastard prince.

30:08.502 --> 30:10.721
Yeah, Theo built a
storm that would crush

30:10.765 --> 30:13.289
this entire dimension
when it detected Jones's DNA,

30:13.333 --> 30:16.292
and he didn't much care
who died in the crossfire.

30:16.336 --> 30:18.033
I'm just saying,
you better

30:18.077 --> 30:20.122
get us to the portal soon
or we're all gonna perish,

30:20.166 --> 30:21.820
thanks to your dear old dad.

30:21.863 --> 30:24.083
[glass shattering]

30:24.910 --> 30:26.476
We can't stay here!

30:26.520 --> 30:28.043
Go!

30:31.699 --> 30:33.440
[groans]
Come on!

30:35.964 --> 30:37.748
Better hurry it up!

30:37.792 --> 30:39.098
Go! I'm right behind you!

30:53.416 --> 30:55.114
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

30:55.157 --> 30:57.203
Yes. All right,
Theo's maps were thorough.

30:57.246 --> 30:59.161
These caves, they lead out close
to the portal.

30:59.205 --> 31:00.859
We just got to go...Hey, stop!

31:01.424 --> 31:02.382
Alex needs a minute.

31:04.514 --> 31:06.125
[coughing]

31:06.168 --> 31:09.215
You know Clyde was just trying
to get under your skin, right?

31:09.258 --> 31:11.304
Doesn't change the fact
that my dad created a trap

31:11.347 --> 31:13.872
