00:02.737 --> 00:05.004
Now you're having
second thoughts.
                       Says who?

00:05.006 --> 00:06.438
Your tone of voice,
your body language.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.290
                  That's not so.

00:08.291 --> 00:10.141
     Yeah, it is. It's like
   you're folding your tent.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.610
        I just got stuck
    on his age for a minute.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.278
  You may have a point there.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.180
        Of course I got
  a point there-- he's green.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.615
    He's the preeminent guy
         in his thing.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.752
         No 25-year-old
   is preeminent in anything.

00:19.754 --> 00:21.420
     So you don't like him
       because of his age

00:21.422 --> 00:22.621
Or because of who he works for?

00:22.623 --> 00:25.424
      You asked me to look
    into their work, I did.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.794
One man's opinion-- it's green,
     because they're green.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.596
            And you're using
              green wrong.
   What?

00:30.598 --> 00:32.164
              Green doesn't mean
          inexperienced anymore.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.399
                        It means
                   eco-friendly.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.951
I know that.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.502
Are we publishing
this conversation?
                      No, but...

00:36.504 --> 00:37.770
Well, as long as
you know

00:37.772 --> 00:40.439
What I mean by green,
then green'll do.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.408
         Were you green
       when you were 25?

00:42.410 --> 00:43.776
No.
        But everyone else is.

00:43.778 --> 00:45.611
I didn't say that.
                 I take it back.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.312
         You don't have a point
             about his age.

00:47.314 --> 00:48.580
   Look, I already said yes.

00:48.582 --> 00:51.183
  Let's just see how it flies.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.184
             Why does everything
                      have to be

00:52.186 --> 00:53.185
      Like pulling teeth?

00:53.187 --> 00:54.186
  You're a good egg, garrett.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.255
    I just want to make sure

00:56.256 --> 00:58.323
    That egg doesn't end up
       all over our face.

00:58.325 --> 00:59.658
      Is that why you put
     office reagan on this?

00:59.660 --> 01:01.326
          As insurance
      against my judgment?

01:01.328 --> 01:03.395
      I put jamie on this
      because he can read

01:03.397 --> 01:06.465
  A potential situation better
      than anybody I know.

01:06.467 --> 01:07.366
 Because you don't trust me to.

01:07.368 --> 01:10.269
    Because it's sensitive.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.439
       Sir, city council
  just moved up their meeting.

01:13.441 --> 01:16.375
      It's now a conflict
  with your jim voutay lunch.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.277
              Oh.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.345
           He's here

01:20.347 --> 01:22.414
        For the council
   of university presidents.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.983
      I'll have to cancel.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.551
       After his school's
    undefeated football team

01:25.553 --> 01:27.152
 Wins a national championship?

01:27.154 --> 01:28.554
      That's a sacrilege.

01:28.556 --> 01:31.356
    Can you do me a favor--
      have lunch with him?

01:33.194 --> 01:35.427
       I'll see if I can
       clear my schedule.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.129
        Problem solved.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074

01:47.641 --> 01:49.174
              Man:
  So this what you guys wear?

01:49.176 --> 01:50.843
             Janko:
    No, that's the fake one

01:50.845 --> 01:52.544
     We give to reporters.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.679
                      (laughing)

01:53.681 --> 01:55.581
Yes, exactly the same,
department issue.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.216
                    Near enough.
                  How do I look?

01:57.218 --> 01:58.217
            Nervous.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.402
                         Is that
                     your thing?

01:59.403 --> 02:00.586
                You like to keep
          reporters off-balance?

02:00.588 --> 02:02.454
               No.
                      That's her
                   thing, right?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.890
Actually, telling the truth
is sometimes her thing.

02:04.892 --> 02:07.459
 You asked her how you looked,
       and she told you.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.496
      Oh, I'm not nervous.
          Just pumped.

02:10.497 --> 02:13.132
You know that show <i> cops? </i>
                           Sure.

02:13.134 --> 02:15.400
     ¶ bad boys, bad boys,
     whatcha gonna do... ¶

02:15.402 --> 02:17.169
Yeah, it's going
to be like that, right?

02:17.171 --> 02:19.438
       ¶ whatcha gonna do
   when they come for you? ¶

02:19.440 --> 02:20.973
   No, I'm a real journalist,

02:20.974 --> 02:22.507
       Not some guy with
     a night-vision camera.

02:22.510 --> 02:25.344
Little more to it
than that.
                      Eh...

02:25.346 --> 02:26.778
       One of the things
  I really like about <i> cops...</i>

02:26.780 --> 02:29.148
      How slanted they are
    towards law enforcement?

02:30.551 --> 02:34.253
 How the guy on the ride-along
 never bothers the actual cops.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.288
            In fact,
    you never even hear him.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.224
   You two make a great pair.

02:39.226 --> 02:40.492
                 Has anyone ever
                  told you that?

02:40.494 --> 02:42.161
                   All the time.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.562
Thank you.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.670
             Danny:
             Linda!

02:51.672 --> 02:53.906
  Linda, have you seen my tie?

02:53.908 --> 02:55.340
You mean the one
you're wearing?

02:55.342 --> 02:56.508
                           Sean:
               Smooth move, dad.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.876
I meant the red tie,
wisenheimer.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.311
Where's your mother?

02:59.313 --> 03:00.579
You're going to be
late for school.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.314
Ain't she driving you?

03:02.316 --> 03:03.448
       She's supposed to.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.917
        It's after 8:00.
    You're going to be late.

03:04.919 --> 03:07.753
Hope so.
                      Linda!

03:11.492 --> 03:12.624
                          Linda.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.396
               Hey, the boys are

03:17.398 --> 03:19.631
                 Waiting for you
                   to take them.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.533
    Don't go to work today.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.668
                    Oh, come on,
                          linda.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.570
  Don't start with this again.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.871
          I'm serious.
  I don't want you out there.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.673
         Something bad
      is going to happen.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.541
      Nothing bad is going
       to happen, linda.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.310
  And you can't do this before
    I go to work every day.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.344
     It's not good for you,

03:32.346 --> 03:33.478
                   It's not good
                         for me.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.580
      I can't help the way
         I feel, danny.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.981
    And I can't quit my job.

03:35.983 --> 03:39.484
        (exhales deeply)

03:39.486 --> 03:42.721
            (sighs)

03:42.723 --> 03:43.855
                            Hey.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.624
          You remember

03:45.626 --> 03:48.293
  What the hospital therapist
          said, right?

03:48.295 --> 03:50.729
     Yeah.
              It's going to take
                   a little time

03:50.731 --> 03:52.931
Before things get back to normal
  after what happened, honey.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.500
    I was shot, danny, okay?

03:55.502 --> 03:58.770
        You can say it.
         I... Was shot.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.744
    Come on, guys. Let's go.
    We're going to be late.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.947
      I'll drive the boys.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.653
                    Is mom okay?

04:14.655 --> 04:16.555
          She's fine.
       Come on, let's go.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.755
 She's better than you're going
  to be if you don't hurry up.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.024
           Let's go.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.806
  So you guys go a whole week

04:34.808 --> 04:36.908
         Without being
  in harm's way, as they say?

04:36.910 --> 04:38.577
                  A whole month.
Longer.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.878
    That must get old fast.

04:39.880 --> 04:40.979
          Not at all.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.047
       Come on, you know.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.448
  The rush of adrenaline once,

04:43.450 --> 04:44.783
       You want it again
       and again, right?

04:44.785 --> 04:47.519
                       No, speak
                   for yourself.

04:47.521 --> 04:50.289
 You know, a quiet day on this
   job is highly underrated.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.823
               Long story short,
                 we like to keep

04:51.825 --> 04:53.992
           The peace peacefully,
     as much as we possibly can.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.560
          Dispatcher:
  12-david, we've got a report

04:55.562 --> 04:58.597
    Of shots fired at 315...
Shots fired! We're going, right?

04:58.599 --> 04:59.931
We're going, right?

04:59.933 --> 05:01.566
           12-david,
      show us responding.

05:01.568 --> 05:02.601
           Yes! Ugh!

05:02.603 --> 05:03.902
           Buckle up.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.604
    No, I like a bumpy ride.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.539
        (siren wailing)

05:07.541 --> 05:08.607
Told you.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.676
       (tires screeching)

05:12.079 --> 05:13.712
  It's 9:00 am on the morning
          of the 18th.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.780
   We have just arrived at...

05:14.782 --> 05:16.282
Jamie:
Hey, get back in the car.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.783
Hey!
     ...911 call reporting shots
          fired at this address.

05:17.785 --> 05:18.950
        Eddie, get him.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.352
                 You need to get
                back in the car.

05:20.354 --> 05:21.720
We are just about to go inside.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.689
No,<i> we</i> are just
about to go inside.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.524
          And he is about to get
                back in the car.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.625
Whoa, are you serious?

05:26.627 --> 05:28.627
This is a ride-along.
I ride along.

05:28.629 --> 05:31.363
                          Janko:
            Not on a shots-fired
                     radio call.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.398
                       Reporter:
               I promise I won't
                 get in the way.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.966
I swear I won't get hurt.
Look, I'm already protected.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.635
Janko:
I don't care.
Not on shots-fired.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.637
                Hey, get back in
              the car right now.
            Get back in the car.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.605
                 Get in the car.
             Get in the car now!
Come on! Come on!

05:40.607 --> 05:42.741
Get back in the car, right now!
        Back in the car!

05:42.743 --> 05:44.810
            Get in the car, now.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.018
        (radio squawks)

06:03.564 --> 06:06.531
(whispers):
Hey... Get back inside.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.972
             Both:
            Police!

06:21.081 --> 06:22.748
   You sure we got the right
       address, partner?

06:22.750 --> 06:24.516
         315 lefferts.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.052
  This is the northeast corner
 apartment on the third floor.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.592
 Something doesn't feel right.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.127
           Copy that.
           (gunshots)

06:41.535 --> 06:43.802
       Eddie.
                        Yeah.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.773
                Colt. He's hurt.

06:47.775 --> 06:48.774
          Hey, are you hit? Hey!

06:48.776 --> 06:50.409
                  What happened?
                  What happened?

06:50.411 --> 06:51.610
Who shot you?

06:51.612 --> 06:53.078
         (colt groans)

06:53.079 --> 06:54.545
            Eddie, we got to get
              him to a hospital!

06:54.548 --> 06:55.714
    We got a bus on the way.

06:55.716 --> 06:56.681
                   Drive! Drive!

06:56.683 --> 06:58.517
Hey, hey, talk to me.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.985
          Talk to me.
           Hey, colt.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.021
        (siren wailing)

07:30.451 --> 07:32.017
The reporter's name
is lorenzo colt.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.452
       I know who he is.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.454
           How is he?
       And is he likely?

07:35.456 --> 07:37.055
His condition is unknown
at this point.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.857
Doctors are working
on him as we speak.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.625
The hospital knows
to call me direct

07:40.627 --> 07:42.093
Soon as they
know something.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.462
               Tell them to know
              something quicker.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.729
Yes, sir.
                Where's garrett?

07:44.731 --> 07:45.931
     Here. I'm here, frank.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.532
   Contacts for next of kin?
         Getting them.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.801
             Lieutenant gormley,
              it's the hospital.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.972
Ten-hut!
                    As you were.

07:53.974 --> 07:57.509
Chief, have patrol canvass
that whole neighborhood.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.211
    If there were eyeballs,

07:59.212 --> 08:00.912
    I want them sitting down
   with our detectives asap.

08:00.914 --> 08:04.616
     And I want all collars
  in that precinct debriefed,

08:04.618 --> 08:06.751
 No matter what the charge is.

08:06.753 --> 08:09.221
               Commissioner.
    Well?

08:09.223 --> 08:10.689
                     Good news--
                    the reporter

08:10.691 --> 08:12.524
            Was wearing a bullet
                     proof vest.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.125
                     It absorbed
             two of the bullets.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.794
          Report says
    there were three shots.

08:15.796 --> 08:16.862
                       Yes, sir.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.530
         The third one
        grazed his neck,

08:18.532 --> 08:20.532
  But thankfully, it was only
        a surface wound.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.700
           Thank god.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.101
            Doc says
   he's resting comfortably,

08:23.103 --> 08:24.703
   Be out of there tomorrow.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.173
       That's good news.

08:28.175 --> 08:33.111
But this reporter was sitting in
  the back of one of our rmps,

08:33.113 --> 08:37.716
And he was wearing a department
    issued nypd windbreaker.

08:37.717 --> 08:41.019
I'm not sure the shooter thought
  he was shooting a reporter.

08:41.020 --> 08:45.090
     He could have thought
     he was killing a cop.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.158
        Let's get to it.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.060
         Find this guy.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.096
      (indistinct chatter)

09:02.743 --> 09:05.210
    I'm sorry this happened.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.214
            Me, too.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.749
      I feel responsible.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.820
          You're not.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.040
                Hey.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.641
                           Baez:
         How you two holding up?

09:36.643 --> 09:38.209
           Hanging in there.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.811
                  You got lucky.
            Could have been you.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.212
You think the shooter was trying
       to take out a cop?

09:41.214 --> 09:42.581
       Yeah, that's what
        we're thinking.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.682
        How's he doing?

09:43.684 --> 09:44.683
           Honestly,

09:44.685 --> 09:46.217
 I think he's better than okay.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.435
What do you mean?

09:47.436 --> 09:48.652
    He likes his adrenaline
          straight up.

09:48.655 --> 09:50.622
              Get the sense he's
          the type of journalist

09:50.623 --> 09:52.590
 Likes to make himself the lead
 in all the stories he writes.

09:52.593 --> 09:53.825
            Did you talk to him?

09:53.827 --> 09:55.010
     Once we were cleared,

09:55.011 --> 09:56.194
      He was on the phone
      with his publisher.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.129
             We'll take a crack.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.098
                         Thanks.
                            Yep.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.934
    Talk about, uh, being in the
  right place at the right time.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.170
    And the drugs they got me on
    aren't too bad, either, huh?

10:05.172 --> 10:07.038
   You mind wrapping that up?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.239
                  Could you just
             give me one second.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.175
                No, no, not you.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.142
                   Two cops just
             walked in the room.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.611
Detectives.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.946
        Are you kidding?
 I'm not sitting this one out.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.781
              I'll be at my desk
           first thing tomorrow.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.049
    Urgent police business.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.250
  He'll have to call you back.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.251
            (laughs)

10:20.253 --> 10:21.786
     You know, technically,

10:21.787 --> 10:23.320
    What you did right there
       is grand larceny.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.823
       Police emergency.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.875
   Do you mind answering some

10:26.876 --> 10:28.359
  Questions for us, mr. Colt?
                          Shoot.

10:28.362 --> 10:30.161
      What can you tell us
 about the person who shot you?

10:30.163 --> 10:32.897
            (scoffs)
       not much, really.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.334
What can you tell me about him?

10:36.336 --> 10:39.204
         We know you're
     a reporter, mr. Colt,

10:39.206 --> 10:40.872
      But things would be
     a lot more productive

10:40.874 --> 10:42.374
       If you let us ask
         the questions.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.142
      Uh, at your service.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.278
Great. Can you tell us anything
 about the person who shot you?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.413
You remember anything?

10:48.415 --> 10:49.414
White, black?

10:49.416 --> 10:50.949
Male, female?

10:50.951 --> 10:52.517
             Uh...

10:52.518 --> 10:54.084
Scars, tattoos,
identifiable marks?

10:54.087 --> 10:56.388
   Anything you can remember
     would be very helpful.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.225
                 Baez: Mr. Colt,
                not for nothing,

11:00.226 --> 11:02.160
     But there's a would-be
    cop killer on the loose,

11:02.162 --> 11:04.329
   And you are our key witness.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.264
          Cop killer?

11:06.266 --> 11:08.800
     Well, you were wearing
      an nypd raid jacket

11:08.802 --> 11:11.336
          In the back
     of an nypd radio car.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.871
          Wha... Uh...

11:12.873 --> 11:14.172
Mr. Colt,

11:14.174 --> 11:16.808
        Could really use
        your help here.

11:16.810 --> 11:20.812
       To be honest, uh,
 everything happened s-so fast.

11:20.814 --> 11:24.816
     I-I... Really just...
         Just blanked.

11:24.818 --> 11:25.950
Huh.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.925
What are you writing?

11:33.927 --> 11:36.261
           I'm sorry.

11:36.263 --> 11:39.264
  I just... Got really tired.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.266
       Or maybe I'm still
     in shock or something.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.001
     Would you mind coming
        back in a while?

11:48.975 --> 11:50.375
  When your memory comes back,

11:50.377 --> 11:51.710
      We really could use
     your help, all right?

11:51.712 --> 11:53.378
Before somebody else gets hurt.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.713
     Copy that, detective.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.449
       And-and thank you
       for understanding.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.129
          What are you
       doing here, sarge?

12:11.131 --> 12:12.263
          Lieutenant.
My bad.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.798
               I'm here to help.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.266
            The whole department
            is at your disposal,

12:15.268 --> 12:17.135
       Chase down whatever leads
            our victim gave you.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.137
   We got no leads-- he says
 he doesn't remember anything,

12:19.139 --> 12:20.138
      That he blacked out.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.272
    Either way, we got nada.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.807
Well, we don't
got nada.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.142
                Well, what's the
               opposite of nada?

12:24.144 --> 12:25.143
             <i> Algo?</i>

12:25.145 --> 12:27.212
                    I mean, what
                     do you got?

12:27.213 --> 12:29.280
               We got a 911 call
          which was a phony call

12:29.282 --> 12:31.149
     'cause the whole thing
          was a setup.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.151
     Whoever made that call
        is our shooter.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.153
         We figure out
      who that caller is,

12:35.155 --> 12:36.821
        And we'll catch
        our cop killer.

12:36.823 --> 12:37.822
                   You still got
                     it, reagan.

12:37.824 --> 12:38.890
        You too, sarge.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.293
          Lieutenant.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.531
      Hope you don't mind
   that you're stuck with me

12:46.533 --> 12:48.066
      Instead of your pal.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.535
               Not at all-- it's
               good to catch up.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.071
       And besides, you spare me
      having to watch frank pick

12:53.073 --> 12:54.539
              All the vegetables
                  off his plate.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.074
    (chuckles)

12:56.076 --> 12:58.276
The canyon of heroes.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.880
             Little known fact--
          behind each photograph

13:01.882 --> 13:03.882
     Is a picture of their dcpi,

13:03.884 --> 13:07.218
         Dusty, forgotten, never
         to be heard from again.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.887
          (chuckling):
You better be careful, garrett.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.188
He might have this place bugged.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.959
  And I'm sorry for not having
  heeded your infinite wisdom

13:14.961 --> 13:17.962
And allowing that perfectly fine
and fully credentialed reporter

13:17.964 --> 13:19.297
     Onto that ride along.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.432
  You were right, I absolutely
     should have been able

13:21.434 --> 13:24.102
    To look into the future
 and see what was gonna happen.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.270
              Wow.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.071
 Sorry, it's been a tough day.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.206
Well, it's
like you said.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.208
It's not something
you could have foreseen.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.544
              Yeah, but I pushed
                     pretty hard

13:32.546 --> 13:34.546
            Against frank's very
            strenuous objection.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.147
                    Big no-no.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.585
        Man: Yeah, yeah,
   I'm standing on the corner

13:40.587 --> 13:43.221
Of northeast lefferts and 17th,
   and I just heard gunfire.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.856
           Operator:
     Okay, calm down, sir.

13:44.857 --> 13:46.490
      Can I have your name
     and a callback number?

13:48.195 --> 13:49.961
           That's it.
      You trace the call?

13:49.963 --> 13:51.963
    It was made from a cheap
       cell phone burner,

13:51.965 --> 13:53.264
   One of those 99-cent jobs.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.265
    No gps.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.466
                        Exactly.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.235
      The best we could do
    is locate the cell tower

13:57.237 --> 14:00.305
 Where it last pinged, but that
  only gives us neighborhood.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.173
     That could be anywhere
        in fort greene.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.842
   All right, play it again.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.310
       You get something?

14:05.312 --> 14:07.312
        Man: Yeah, yeah,
   I'm standing on the corner

14:07.314 --> 14:08.980
Of northeast lefferts and 17th,
   and I just heard gunfire.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.281
Operator: Okay, calm down, sir.
    Can I have your name...

14:10.283 --> 14:12.417
    Okay, stop right there,
     rewind a few seconds.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.619
              Man:
  ...And I just heard gunfire.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.154
         You hear that?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.288
           The noise
       in the background.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.090
No, what do you hear?

14:19.092 --> 14:20.558
         I don't know;
         play it again.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.327
       Sounds like an mta
   announcement or something.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.329
Just try to isolate the
background noise for me.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.199
     Female voice: The next
  three train will be arriving

14:28.201 --> 14:30.935
  At the nevins street station
       in three minutes.

14:30.937 --> 14:32.403
          Made the call near the
             nevins street stop.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.272
And these guys always toss
their burner phones.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.241
             Call it in-- we got
           to get an area search

14:36.243 --> 14:38.076
      And find that phone.

14:41.514 --> 14:44.515
And this is where we hold
our press conferences.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.517
            Let me guess, one of
          franks favorite rooms.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.052
    (chuckles)

14:48.054 --> 14:49.520
Once a year, he instructs
the bomb squad guys

14:49.522 --> 14:51.055
To demolish the place.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.523
        Getting him in here must
          be like pulling teeth.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.359
Exactly.
             (chuckles)

14:54.361 --> 14:57.228
                 Uh, frank has a
                 lot of virtues,

14:57.230 --> 14:58.930
             But suffering fools
       gladly isn't one of them.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.432
               That's the thing,
              they're not fools.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.301
Just 'cause someone has
a different point of view

15:03.303 --> 15:05.970
Or a difficult question
or a fresh take on something...

15:05.972 --> 15:07.305
                Uh, doesn't make
                    them a fool,

15:07.307 --> 15:09.307
              It just makes them
        someone who's not frank.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.441
Not that I'm saying
frank's that.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.710
                     No, I know.

15:12.711 --> 15:14.978
But getting him to pivot,
to shift his weight a little.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.447
                  Pulling teeth.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.450
      A guy who can make a frank
  reagan see things another way,

15:19.452 --> 15:21.452
         That is a valuable guy.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.321
Thanks, jim.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.456
But let's just keep that
between us, okay?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.458
           Oh, come on, garrett,
           frank must know that.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.461
If he does, he certainly
wouldn't want to be reminded.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.397
Trust me.

15:34.668 --> 15:36.334
             Deal.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.670
                    So I'll keep
                 that between us

15:38.672 --> 15:42.173
 If you do the same with this.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.708
    What's this?

15:43.710 --> 15:45.243
                One of the perks

15:45.245 --> 15:47.378
     Of our school winning
   the national championship

15:47.380 --> 15:50.248
    Is our board has finally
     ponied up enough money

15:50.250 --> 15:53.017
         For me to hire
   a real communications man.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.553
       It's a job offer?

15:55.555 --> 15:57.488
              Yes.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.393
      Our university needs
     to do some rebranding.

16:02.395 --> 16:06.264
           See, the future is in
       harvesting from overseas,

16:06.266 --> 16:09.267
       But overseas doesn't care
          about college football

16:09.269 --> 16:11.736
            When they're looking
            at higher education.

16:11.738 --> 16:15.239
I think you made a mistake
and put down one too many zeros.

16:15.241 --> 16:19.377
Garrett, I didn't get our school
  to the top of our conference

16:19.379 --> 16:23.314
    In sports and academics
  by making too many mistakes.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.754
  Then this is quite an offer.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.422
           (chuckles)

16:31.424 --> 16:33.358
 I was hoping you'd think that.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.434
Come on, that phone's got to be
     around here somewhere.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.304
       Whoever finds it,
       rounds are on me!

16:46.306 --> 16:49.040
Detective,
over here.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.314
   Looks like a phone to me.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.315
           Hey! Hey.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.449
Crowbar, come on.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.052
Get this thing up.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.760
   There we go, look at that.

17:08.762 --> 17:10.361
             Baez!

17:10.363 --> 17:13.231
        We struck gold.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.233
You're not gonna believe what
that little punk colt did.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.569
                           What?

17:20.140 --> 17:21.406
     Who the hell is that?

17:21.407 --> 17:24.776
   Baez: Colt had a composite
        sketch drawn up

17:24.778 --> 17:26.243
Of a detailed description
of our shooter.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.413
    Why'd he hold out on us?

17:28.415 --> 17:31.616
  So he could break the story
        on his web site.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.732
                     Hey, there.
                 Can I help you?

17:48.701 --> 17:51.536
                           Colt.

17:51.538 --> 17:55.106
         Oh, hey, officers, I'll
      be with you in just a sec.

17:55.108 --> 17:58.576
        That's "detectives," and
          you'll be with us now.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.579
           I'm sorry,
   is there something wrong?

18:03.516 --> 18:05.383
       Uh, yeah, probably
     should have given you

18:05.385 --> 18:06.868
  A heads up about that, huh?

18:06.869 --> 18:08.352
What happened to,
"I must have blacked out"?

18:08.354 --> 18:11.289
     I did, but then it all
        came back to me.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.224
 Right, just in time to put it
     on the internet, huh?

18:13.226 --> 18:16.227
     Detective, I am under
      no legal requirement

18:16.229 --> 18:17.829
    To share any information
           with you.

18:17.831 --> 18:19.831
            And as a journalist,

18:19.833 --> 18:23.334
  I have an obligation to inform
 my readers, first and foremost.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.870
We're the police, not some
rival news organization.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.138
This information
could have helped us

18:27.140 --> 18:29.140
Apprehend this very
dangerous man.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.309
                 A dangerous man
                   who shot you.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.311
      Exactly, detective--
          he shot me.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.779
  And I believe I should have
  the right to deal with that

18:34.781 --> 18:36.481
 Whichever way I think is best.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.785
   Do you understand the kind
of business you're running here?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.487
      You are going to get
        somebody killed.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.422
        I'm just chasing
      a story, detective.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.890
   I'm chasing a cop killer.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.159
  If you don't want to help us
    get him, that's on you.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.494
That was the squad.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.629
No dna or fingerprints
on the burner phone,

18:51.631 --> 18:53.164
But they did find
surveillance footage

18:53.166 --> 18:54.499
From a nearby
subway station.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.633
               Great. You take a
              look at the video,

18:55.635 --> 18:57.168
              See if our shooter
             made an appearance.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.337
               I'm gonna go talk
                   to my sister.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.441
Absolutely not.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.775
                     Just let me
                   make my case.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.444
You don't have a case--
that's my point.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.312
                 I'm looking for
                   a cop killer.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.447
(scoffs)
danny.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.781
               Who could kill me
                  or jamie next.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.316
Okay, a, don't say that.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.318
B, no he's not,
he didn't kill anyone.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.320
And c, he shot
a reporter, not a cop.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.456
              A reporter dressed
                  up like a cop.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.458
Look, I'm not trying
to be insensitive here.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.327
I get it, he's a bad guy--
I want him as badly as you do.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.796
But that doesn't mean
we start usurping the law.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.466
You call investigative
grand juries all the time.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.835
Yes, but not for
fishing expeditions.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.504
              It's not a fishing
               expedition, okay?

19:33.506 --> 19:34.572
              We have a suspect.

19:34.574 --> 19:35.606
Come on, danny.

19:35.608 --> 19:36.941
What do you want me to do?

19:36.943 --> 19:38.476
Call a grand jury and say,

19:38.478 --> 19:41.612
"people of the state
of new york against...

19:41.614 --> 19:43.681
Pencil-sketched hoodie guy"?

19:43.683 --> 19:46.217
    Then write it up against the
      boogie man for all I care.

19:46.219 --> 19:49.220
     The only way I can subpoena
         this ass-faced reporter

19:49.222 --> 19:51.589
    And get him to testify under
         oath is if you help me.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.491
             Okay.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.561
I know you want this
for the right reasons.

19:56.563 --> 19:59.230
But how much of your angst for
this case is about the case,

19:59.232 --> 20:01.732
And how much of it
is about linda...

20:03.603 --> 20:06.504
...Who's trembling every time
you walk out the door?

20:11.811 --> 20:13.744
   Are you gonna help me or not?

20:14.647 --> 20:16.581
              Not.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.751
Danny.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.563
            Excuse me, mr. Colt.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.564
Oh, hey, uh,
officer reagan

20:33.566 --> 20:36.500
And trusty sidekick, uh...

20:36.502 --> 20:37.501
Officer janko.

20:37.503 --> 20:38.502
Uh, can we
talk to you?

20:38.504 --> 20:39.971
                  Uh, sorry, I'm
                 all talked out.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.505
         Just a minute
     of your time, please.

20:41.507 --> 20:43.074
                Didn't you hear?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.642
        I had a lovely chat with
      the detective on the case,

20:44.644 --> 20:46.577
                And we're all on
                  the same page,

20:46.578 --> 20:48.511
    And I am a selfish ass who's
only interested in a good story,

20:48.514 --> 20:51.515
        But we also agree that I
        am well within my rights

20:51.517 --> 20:52.650
             To not say anything
                   to the police

20:52.652 --> 20:54.518
              And print whatever
                the hell I like.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.520
 I know your conversation with
my brother got a little heated,

20:56.522 --> 20:57.722
     But this is not that.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.257
        We're off duty.

20:59.259 --> 21:00.725
       This is... This is
      totally unofficial.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.260
                      Good night
                  and good luck.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.729
Hey, what the hell
is wrong with you?

21:04.731 --> 21:07.265
    You have a lot of nerve
  asking what's wrong with me.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.267
   Look at your patrol guide,
            officer.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.501
    I haven't done anything.

21:10.503 --> 21:11.869
             That's the problem.
                        Exactly.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.404
       You know, we work
   with victims all the time

21:13.406 --> 21:14.972
    That don't want to help
      with investigations.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.474
       But that's because
        they're scared.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.643
        They're afraid someone's
                gonna retaliate.

21:18.645 --> 21:21.746
     And I don't like that,
         but I get it.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.681
       What you're doing,
      I don't understand.

21:23.683 --> 21:24.615
   Then let me enlighten you.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.751
   My job is not to help you.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.386
     It is to tell a story.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.921
  Hopefully, a compelling one
   that not only entertains,

21:30.923 --> 21:33.758
      But also sheds light
         on our times.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.993
    I'm sitting in the back
        of a patrol car

21:35.995 --> 21:37.712
During broad daylight.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.430
That is supposed to be one
of the safest places on earth.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.499
       Next thing I know,
          I'm blasted

21:41.501 --> 21:43.668
        By three bullets
    from a nine millimeter.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.002
Now, I don't know
about you,

21:45.004 --> 21:46.637
     But I think that says
   something pretty profound

21:46.639 --> 21:48.873
About the world we're living in.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.541
         You just said
   it was a nine millimeter.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.909
  What makes you think it was
       a nine millimeter?

21:51.911 --> 21:53.544
     You gonna have to read
      my next post online

21:53.546 --> 21:54.912
    Just like everyone else.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.659
She said no, huh?

22:08.661 --> 22:10.428
         Of course she said no--
         it's her favorite word.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.796
Well, maybe this
will cheer you up.

22:11.798 --> 22:12.897
I was able
to pull a still

22:12.898 --> 22:13.997
    Off the surveillance footage

22:14.000 --> 22:15.700
        Near the subway station.

22:15.702 --> 22:16.667
       That's pretty damn close.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.369
Yep, the time stamp
on the video

22:18.371 --> 22:19.837
Matches exactly
with the 911 call.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.072
         Great, you run his face
             through the system?

22:21.074 --> 22:23.574
Michael hicks.
He got out a month ago.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.609
Has a long history
of violence against the cops.

22:25.611 --> 22:27.011
                  Great, you got
                 his last known?
      Yeah.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.379
   Then what are we waiting for?

22:28.381 --> 22:29.647
His last known address
was bogus.

22:29.649 --> 22:32.450
Some vacant lot
in the south bronx.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.685
Okay, uh, you-you got
his phone number, right?

22:34.687 --> 22:36.787
            Well, yeah, but what
                are we gonna do?

22:36.789 --> 22:38.756
      Call him and tell him he's
    wanted for attempted murder?

22:38.758 --> 22:40.991
            Can he come and meet
                 us around 8:00?

22:40.993 --> 22:43.060
Something like that.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.032
Yes, hello, michael hicks?

22:48.034 --> 22:49.800
        Congratulations!

22:49.802 --> 22:51.702
My name is richard mollo.

22:51.704 --> 22:52.870
 I work with the new york mets.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.705
         And you, sir,
   have won a wonderful prize

22:54.707 --> 22:57.842
       Of a luxury suite
 to any new york mets home game

22:57.844 --> 22:59.710
Of your choice
for this season.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.679
      No, congratulations.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.848
    Okay, all you got to do
           is meet me

23:03.850 --> 23:05.750
          Between 8:00
     and 9:00 p.M. Tonight

23:05.752 --> 23:07.518
At the box office at citi field

23:07.520 --> 23:10.388
And you can collect your prize.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.923
Yes, ask for me--
richard mollo.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.459
I'll see you then.

23:15.461 --> 23:16.994
Throw the pitch,

23:16.996 --> 23:19.063
        Make the catch.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.703
          (door opens)

23:25.705 --> 23:27.705
Sir, jim's here.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.540
                            Hey.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.041
              Hey.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.943
       How was the tour?

23:32.945 --> 23:35.713
         Enlightening.

23:35.715 --> 23:38.482
I'd ask if it's been a hard day,

23:38.484 --> 23:41.786
      But I get the sense
 that every day is around here.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.854
     Some more than others.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.790
     Do you have good help
      carrying the weight?

23:45.792 --> 23:48.759
   I do, and grateful for it.

23:48.761 --> 23:49.827
            Garrett?

23:49.828 --> 23:50.894
    Add it all up at the end
          of the year,

23:50.897 --> 23:52.897
       Yeah, he more than
       pulls his weight.

23:52.899 --> 23:53.998
     He's a good guy, too.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.834
           Stubborn.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.869
            But yes.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.771
You want to take back your offer

24:00.773 --> 24:02.540
  For me to make him an offer?

24:02.542 --> 24:04.608
     That stands separate.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.679
     You mean, you didn't?

24:08.681 --> 24:10.848
       No, just checking.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.082
          So, you did?
Yes.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.784
        And he said yes.

24:13.786 --> 24:14.985
 Well, he wants to sleep on it.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.987
A figure like you talked about?

24:16.989 --> 24:18.823
           (chuckles)
         the exact one.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.458
        He's gonna have
     some trouble sleeping

24:20.460 --> 24:23.594
    With a number like that
   floating around his head.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.765
        I'll rescind it
       if you ask me to.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.834
            (sighs)

24:30.870 --> 24:33.471
      I couldn't do that.

24:33.473 --> 24:35.473
            I know.

24:35.475 --> 24:38.075
      But I had to offer.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.967
        (sirens wailing)

25:02.969 --> 25:04.902
  (engine revs, tires screech)

25:14.714 --> 25:16.514
      Police! Don't move!
         Shut it down!

25:16.516 --> 25:17.581
                   Shut it down!

25:17.583 --> 25:18.582
Officer:
Drop the keys.

25:18.584 --> 25:19.917
Get out the car!

25:19.919 --> 25:21.285
         Drop the keys!

25:21.287 --> 25:23.854
       Put your forehead
     on the steering wheel!

25:23.856 --> 25:25.289
           Put your hands behind
      the back of your head now!

25:25.291 --> 25:27.758
               Come on, get out!

25:27.760 --> 25:28.959
            Get out!

25:30.830 --> 25:33.531
                        Come on.

25:33.533 --> 25:36.534
  Ball game's been postponed,
           tough guy.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.891
             Danny:
Three times, you've been charged

25:43.892 --> 25:45.575
With assaulting a police officer
     and you just finished

25:45.578 --> 25:47.161
       A ten-year stretch
 for stabbing a police officer

25:47.162 --> 25:48.745
         While resisting arrest.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here,

25:48.748 --> 25:51.115
       Michael, and say that you
        got a problem with cops.

25:51.117 --> 25:55.252
          Oink, oink.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.855
         That's funny.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.590
           This you?

26:00.192 --> 26:01.559
             Nope.

26:01.561 --> 26:02.860
              No?
        Then who is it?

26:02.862 --> 26:04.061
           My lawyer.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.261
That supposed to be funny, too?

26:05.264 --> 26:07.865
             Maybe you should've
               taken up a career

26:07.867 --> 26:09.767
     As a stand-up comedian
    instead of a cop killer.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.001
             Truth.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.203
        How about this--
           this you?

26:13.205 --> 26:15.189
          Yeah, yeah,
   I'm standing on the corner

26:15.190 --> 26:17.174
 Of northeast lefferts and 17th
   and I just heard gunfire.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.926
         911 operator:
     Okay, calm down, sir.

26:18.927 --> 26:20.677
      Can I have your name
     and a callback number?

26:20.680 --> 26:22.146
         That ain't me.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.714
         Let me guess--
       your lawyer again?

26:23.716 --> 26:25.916
          Gots to be.
     Well, we took a sample

26:25.918 --> 26:27.785
    Of your voice and ran it
     against this 911 call

26:27.787 --> 26:29.353
     And it's a 95% match.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.588
                      So I'd say

26:30.590 --> 26:32.923
       It gots to be you.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.826
    That's enough for me to call
         the grand jury already.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.361
And yet we still here flirting!

26:37.363 --> 26:38.862
      Think I'm bluffing?

26:38.864 --> 26:40.197
         If you wasn't,
         I'd be talking

26:40.199 --> 26:42.232
      To a judge right now
 instead of you, little piggy.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.001
      This little piggy's
   the only thing keeping you

26:44.003 --> 26:45.970
     From a life sentence.

26:45.971 --> 26:47.938
           Now, you want to work
         with me and come clean,

26:47.940 --> 26:49.206
       Maybe I'll work with you.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.341
      And if I stay dirty?

26:50.343 --> 26:51.709
   Well, I got an eyewitness

26:51.711 --> 26:52.876
 On the other side of this door

26:52.878 --> 26:54.278
 An eyewitness who watched you

26:54.280 --> 26:56.113
               Pump three rounds
               into a squad car!

26:56.115 --> 26:57.598
                 And let me tell
                  you something.

26:57.599 --> 26:59.082
       If that eyewitness
   picks you out of a lineup,

26:59.085 --> 27:00.284
        You gonna spend
     the rest of your life

27:00.286 --> 27:02.319
In a box smaller than this one!

27:04.657 --> 27:06.657
      So, what do you say?

27:06.659 --> 27:09.093
          Oink, oink!

27:11.731 --> 27:13.197
         When I ask you
        to turn around,

27:13.199 --> 27:16.300
You're gonna hold your number up
   under your chin like that.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.335
               You know how this
               all works, right?

27:18.337 --> 27:20.738
        I do.
                 You see the man
                   who shot you,

27:20.740 --> 27:23.340
  Just tell us his number and
 where you recognize him from.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.109
      And if I do see him
    and I do point him out,

27:25.111 --> 27:27.645
      What's in it for me?

27:27.647 --> 27:30.080
      The guy who shot you
         goes to jail.

27:30.082 --> 27:32.182
    And you take a dangerous
    criminal off the street.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.350
     Can I get five minutes
      with him afterwards?

27:33.352 --> 27:35.252
                         No.
     Look, playtime's over.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.171
A positive I.D. From you

27:37.172 --> 27:39.089
         Allows us to charge him
          with attempted murder.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.658
           (stammers)

27:40.660 --> 27:42.826
          I'm holding
      all the cards here.

27:42.828 --> 27:43.861
        I'm warning you.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.729
      And I'm kidding you.

27:45.731 --> 27:47.831
           Thank you.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.299
               Turn them around.

27:49.301 --> 27:51.135
          Turn around.
         All right, take a look.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.780
Can you identify the man
who shot you, mr. Colt.

28:07.186 --> 28:10.120
                       Mr. Colt?

28:10.122 --> 28:11.889
              No.

28:11.891 --> 28:13.257
            I can't.

28:13.259 --> 28:16.360
   You're absolutely certain
       he's not in there?

28:16.362 --> 28:18.328
          Absolutely.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.097
             Would you like some
            more time, mr. Colt?

28:20.099 --> 28:22.833
No, he's not there.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.168
               I'm sorry, danny.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.969
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

28:25.971 --> 28:27.404
                  Hey!

28:27.406 --> 28:29.373
               What the hell are
             you doing in there?

28:29.375 --> 28:31.041
You don't have
the guy, detective.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.309
That's not on me.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.811
                 How about I put
               something on you?

28:33.812 --> 28:35.312
                Like obstructing
    governmental administration,

28:35.314 --> 28:37.281
         Hindering prosecution--
              how about perjury?

28:37.283 --> 28:39.283
            Or whatever the hell
            else I can think of?

28:39.285 --> 28:40.417
Because I don't
agree with you?

28:40.419 --> 28:42.152
               'cause I'm lying!
No, I'm not.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.921
And even if I were,
lying is not against the law

28:43.923 --> 28:45.155
Unless you're under oath.

28:45.157 --> 28:46.290
                Why the hell are
                 you doing this?

28:46.292 --> 28:48.358
Doing what--
going back to work?

28:51.464 --> 28:53.731
           (knocking)

28:59.071 --> 29:02.806
I just heard
about the reporter.

29:02.808 --> 29:04.975
                     Yep.

29:04.977 --> 29:07.277
And, uh, if you want
to tell me I told you so,

29:07.279 --> 29:09.279
Well, I-I deserve it.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.248
    Nobody's gloating here.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.283
     The whole damn thing's
      a mess and a shame.

29:13.285 --> 29:16.086
            Frank, I understand.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.427
    Actually, you know what?

29:23.429 --> 29:25.863
    No, I don't understand.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.865
           If I'd put
     woodward or bernstein

29:27.867 --> 29:29.266
      On that drive-along,

29:29.268 --> 29:31.401
        We'd still have
a shot-up reporter on our hands.

29:31.403 --> 29:33.203
  Except woodward or bernstein

29:33.205 --> 29:37.141
 Picks this guy out of a lineup
     ten times out of ten.

29:37.143 --> 29:38.776
          I'm supposed
     to be able to predict

29:38.778 --> 29:40.444
 How every person who interacts
      with this department

29:40.446 --> 29:43.013
   Is gonna behave under any
     and all circumstances?

29:43.015 --> 29:44.414
           Garrett...

29:44.416 --> 29:47.017
 I'm not doing this right now.

29:47.019 --> 29:47.985
           No, when?

29:47.987 --> 29:49.219
        How about never?

29:49.221 --> 29:51.255
        You put that kid
    in the back of our rmp.

29:51.257 --> 29:52.823
   No spin's gonna change it.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.525
         Let's move on.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.361
        Maybe I should.

29:57.363 --> 30:00.230
      Maybe... It's time.

30:00.232 --> 30:04.001
Jim voutay made me a job offer.

30:04.003 --> 30:07.004
              Oh?

30:07.006 --> 30:09.439
     At a very high salary.

30:09.441 --> 30:12.042
   I understand if you think
      you should take it.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.411
    That's not quite honest.

30:14.413 --> 30:15.813
          How's that?

30:15.815 --> 30:17.581
  I think it's what you think
          I should do.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.884
     If you want to leave,
      don't put it on me.

30:20.886 --> 30:22.386
            Own it.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.154
         He's your pal.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.455
    No way he approaches me

30:25.457 --> 30:27.090
         Without first
     getting your blessing.

30:27.092 --> 30:29.393
         You asked jim
     to make me this offer,

30:29.395 --> 30:32.496
    So I'd have a parachute
on my way down from this floor.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.834
     That's just not true.

30:36.836 --> 30:39.570
      Oh, come on, frank.
            Own it.

30:40.906 --> 30:42.840
          (door opens)

30:42.842 --> 30:44.908
         (door closes)

30:52.251 --> 30:54.284
      I don't really understand.
    If the reporter knows it was

30:54.286 --> 30:56.553
          The guy that shot him,
    why wouldn't he just say so?

30:56.555 --> 30:58.422
Maybe he's afraid
he'll retaliate.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.857
  No, that happens sometimes.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.491
 But that wasn't the case here.

31:01.493 --> 31:04.928
 No, in this case, the reporter
wants a lead role in the story.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.864
    Right, that way he gets
   a better story out of it.

31:06.866 --> 31:09.066
  Which makes him a showboat,
      not a real reporter.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.034
    People still say "showboat"?

31:11.036 --> 31:12.569
             I do.

31:12.571 --> 31:15.539
      Isn't there some way
you can make him tell the truth?

31:15.541 --> 31:17.408
 That is a very good question.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.276
        Maybe aunt erin
  can help you find that out.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.578
   I'll pass that off to the
  framers of the constitution.

31:21.580 --> 31:24.014
    Well, they're not here.

31:24.016 --> 31:27.050
  No, sean, not in this case.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.953
     Why can't you just...
  Make someone tell the truth?

31:29.955 --> 31:32.589
     (scattered chuckling)

31:34.360 --> 31:36.293
       Apple doesn't fall
       far from the tree.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.528
         Nicky: What if your dad
            did something wrong,

31:38.530 --> 31:39.596
    And you found out that,

31:39.598 --> 31:41.632
      If you told anyone,
        he'd be in jail.

31:41.634 --> 31:43.367
        Would you still
      testify against him?

31:43.369 --> 31:44.968
              I'd have his back.

31:45.537 --> 31:46.536
           (chuckles)

31:46.538 --> 31:47.537
Erin:
You see, it's not so...

31:47.539 --> 31:49.223
                Black and white.

31:49.224 --> 31:50.908
    But this reporter isn't
  doing it to protect anyone,

31:50.910 --> 31:51.942
   He's doing it for himself.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.410
 Yeah, but he still has rights.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.680
Yeah, but I think that "rights"
     thing is way overused.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.615
Said no one, ever.

31:58.617 --> 32:01.218
   How'd this guy get a ride
 in the car in the first place?

32:07.626 --> 32:08.659
        (phone ringing)

32:08.661 --> 32:11.028
            Well...

32:11.030 --> 32:12.229
 That's a good question, jack.

32:12.231 --> 32:13.664
      (ringing continues)

32:13.666 --> 32:15.632
  He was invited by my office,
          which means

32:15.634 --> 32:17.301
      The responsibility's
        on my shoulders.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.636
 (ringing stops)
         was that supposed to be
               a good idea?

32:19.638 --> 32:23.941
       (ringing resumes)

32:25.978 --> 32:28.078
       Saved by the bell.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.413
                 What happens to
                the bad guy now?

32:29.415 --> 32:30.714
            The, uh, the one who
              shot the reporter?

32:30.716 --> 32:33.517
    Without a witness I.D.,
       he gets released.

32:33.519 --> 32:35.485
              Wait, so he's just
          out of jail right now?

32:35.487 --> 32:36.720
Yeah.
            That's right.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.222
   Is somebody watching him?

32:38.223 --> 32:39.723
   That would be harassment.
   The police can't do that.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.391
                           Sean:
            But he shot someone.

32:41.393 --> 32:42.426
           Allegedly.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.560
 Someone he thought was a cop.

32:43.562 --> 32:44.995
     And now he's just free
        to go wherever?

32:44.997 --> 32:46.480
         I'm afraid so.

32:46.481 --> 32:47.964
      But what if he tries
     to shoot someone else?

32:47.967 --> 32:49.599
Danny: Exactly.
    What if he tries to shoot
           another cop?

32:49.601 --> 32:50.667
   Okay, that's enough, okay?

32:50.669 --> 32:51.969
       Can we just stop?

32:57.977 --> 32:59.643
         Something wrong, linda?

32:59.645 --> 33:01.095
   There is something wrong.

33:01.096 --> 33:02.546
 There is something very wrong
         with the fact

33:02.548 --> 33:04.648
That every time that this family
     sits down for dinner,

33:04.650 --> 33:07.017
  We have to talk about crime
         and criminals.

33:07.019 --> 33:09.119
      I mean, couldn't we,
         just for once,

33:09.121 --> 33:11.621
Just... You know,
sit together,

33:11.623 --> 33:14.458
       And have a normal
         family dinner?

33:18.530 --> 33:21.231
    (footsteps approaching)

33:22.701 --> 33:25.535
     Lorenzo colt is dead.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.381
        (sighs heavily)

33:43.088 --> 33:44.588
     Garrett: We appreciate
  your respect and sensitivity

33:44.590 --> 33:45.990
Around the crime scene,

33:45.991 --> 33:47.391
While detectives continue
their investigation.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.593
Our thoughts and prayers
are with mr. Colt's family.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.228
Baez: So you're thinking
he was pushed?

33:51.230 --> 33:53.230
                     No cameras.

33:53.232 --> 33:54.598
                   Neighbors see
               or hear anything?

33:54.600 --> 33:57.434
Baez: Just the crash
of him landing here.

33:57.436 --> 33:58.886
         Detectives...

33:58.887 --> 34:00.337
You knew him, didn't you,
deputy commissioner?

34:00.339 --> 34:01.538
                    A little.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.707
   I'm sorry, sir.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.709
        What do you have so far?

34:05.711 --> 34:07.577
We're thinking maybe
he was pushed.

34:07.579 --> 34:10.514
         He's got michael hicks'
        phone number and address

34:10.516 --> 34:12.181
Written down here.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.784
             Kept going on about
       wanting to meet with him.

34:13.786 --> 34:15.585
                        Garrett:
              The little I knew,

34:15.587 --> 34:19.121
              He was a very good
         investigative reporter.

34:19.123 --> 34:21.391
     Last number he dialed
           was hicks.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.693
      Maybe got his five minutes
            with him, after all.

34:23.695 --> 34:26.463
           I don't remember cole
        wearing glasses, do you?

34:27.533 --> 34:29.199
        Can I see those?

34:31.503 --> 34:33.570
     These aren't glasses;
      they're spy glasses.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.804
They have a camera,
right here.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.440
                On his web site,
                   he'd do those

34:36.442 --> 34:38.507
   Gotcha ambush interviews.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.310
Those are the glasses he wears.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.945
            Really.

34:41.946 --> 34:43.579
 Well, maybe we can figure out
       who ambushed him.

34:49.188 --> 34:52.456
     So you had no contact
 whatsoever with lorenzo colt?

34:52.458 --> 34:55.391
    I don't even know who is
       lorenzo colt, man.

34:55.393 --> 34:57.327
            He knows who you is.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.262
            (sighs)

34:59.264 --> 35:00.555
         Got his phone records
              right here.

35:00.556 --> 35:01.847
           Seems you and him had
         a lengthy conversation.

35:01.848 --> 35:03.139
        Yeah, all right,
     all right, all right.

35:03.140 --> 35:04.431
      So the man called me
     last night-- so what?

35:04.436 --> 35:05.735
           For what?
   He want to interview you?

35:05.737 --> 35:07.571
      He said all kind of
     whack noise like that.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.139
  I told him to step off, man.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.706
         Step off a building,
      is that what you told him?

35:10.709 --> 35:13.210
(scoffs, sighs)

35:13.212 --> 35:14.644
             Speak to in person,
                or on the phone?

35:14.646 --> 35:15.712
         On the phone.

35:15.714 --> 35:18.115
          And you had nothing
             to do with him

35:18.117 --> 35:19.116
          Doing a triple lindy

35:19.118 --> 35:20.117
                  Off the top of
                  that building.

35:20.119 --> 35:21.284
     Nothing, man! Nothing!

35:21.286 --> 35:24.754
          Well, you must have an
     evil twin, then, my friend.

35:26.525 --> 35:27.591
                    Take a look.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.861
            (sighs)

35:30.863 --> 35:31.862
    Oh, you're telling me--
          no, no, no.

35:31.864 --> 35:33.286
        I don't want to,
        I'm not gonna...

35:33.287 --> 35:34.709
        Colt: Ju-ju-just
    a ten-minute interview.

35:34.710 --> 35:36.132
            No, man!
      No names, no photos,
        just you and me.

35:36.135 --> 35:37.751
  The victim and the shooter!

35:37.752 --> 35:39.368
   Look, you made a bad play
   coming at me like this...

35:39.371 --> 35:40.537
      Colt: I don't know.
       The way I see it,

35:40.539 --> 35:43.440
   My play is your only way,
           all right?

35:43.442 --> 35:44.841
       If you don't want
        to work with me,

35:44.843 --> 35:46.510
  I have no choice but to call
       detective reagan,

35:46.512 --> 35:48.912
  And let him know that I have
     miraculously recovered

35:48.914 --> 35:50.614
    From my temporary spate
          of amnesia.

35:50.616 --> 35:52.349
 Hicks: Yeah? Well, let me see
    you recover from this...

35:52.351 --> 35:53.383
             Colt:
     Hey! Hey, hey! Don't!

35:53.385 --> 35:54.384
        (hicks grunting)

35:54.386 --> 35:55.452
              No!
                   (grunts)

35:55.454 --> 35:56.586
               Colt: Get off...!
                     No! No, no!

35:56.588 --> 35:58.622
        (colt and hicks
       grunting, yelling)

35:58.624 --> 36:00.657
        (colt screaming)

36:00.659 --> 36:01.725
             (thud)

36:08.600 --> 36:09.866
                 Camera.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.703
                Oink-oink.

36:20.879 --> 36:21.878
             Hello!

36:21.880 --> 36:22.879
                        Hi, dad.
                        Hi, dad.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.347
Hey. Where are
you guys going?

36:24.349 --> 36:26.216
        Take a guess, detective.

36:26.218 --> 36:27.717
           Have fun.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.521
I made it. I'm alive.

36:33.559 --> 36:34.858
               I know.

36:40.499 --> 36:41.965
                (groans)

36:41.967 --> 36:43.600
What's all this?

36:43.602 --> 36:44.801
                            Hmm?

36:46.605 --> 36:49.839
           I am gonna get better
                soon, I promise.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.945
      I know.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.820
      (sighs)

37:21.607 --> 37:23.240
You wanted to see me?

37:25.811 --> 37:28.812
                 I need a favor.
                 Personal favor.

37:29.982 --> 37:31.815
         I really have
     stayed here too long.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.016
    I know all your tricks.

37:33.018 --> 37:35.619
     The hell you talking about?

37:35.621 --> 37:38.321
    If you need to apologize
          to someone,

37:38.323 --> 37:39.556
        But want to keep
        the upper hand,

37:39.558 --> 37:41.825
     You ask them to do you
       a personal favor.

37:41.827 --> 37:42.826
           Quoting...

37:42.828 --> 37:45.462
Francis x. Reagan there.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.530
         I got nothing
       to apologize for.

37:47.532 --> 37:50.500
   It was an even worse idea
  than I first thought it was.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.403
       What's the favor?

37:53.405 --> 37:54.938
            (sighs)
        stay on a month

37:54.940 --> 37:57.807
          And get your
  replacement up and running.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.412
             Okay.

38:03.348 --> 38:04.514
         Better yet...

38:04.516 --> 38:06.816
     Just stay on, period.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.557
      It's a lot of money.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.694
          I know that.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.936
         Please, stay.

38:28.307 --> 38:29.739
              Why?

38:29.741 --> 38:31.975
      Because I need you.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.744
        And you need me.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.313
          Maybe once.

38:40.952 --> 38:44.821
You make my job, my duty, me...

38:44.823 --> 38:47.757
  More palatable to thousands
     who would, otherwise,

38:47.759 --> 38:49.626
        Cover their ears
     and turn their backs.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.094
          I know that.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.399
         What do I get?

38:56.401 --> 38:58.435
    If you don't know that,

38:58.437 --> 39:01.404
         You're right,
  you should take jim's offer.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.577
             Okay.

39:07.579 --> 39:08.745
            (sighs)

39:08.747 --> 39:10.914
        Anyone... Who...

39:10.916 --> 39:13.983
      Has reached the ages
        you and I have,

39:13.985 --> 39:16.786
   Who works the hours we do,

39:16.788 --> 39:19.723
      Without hardly ever
     looking at the clock,

39:19.725 --> 39:22.592
      Who can still fight

39:22.594 --> 39:24.894
        Over what we do,

39:24.896 --> 39:26.996
         The way we do,

39:26.998 --> 39:31.601
Like we're still green as grass
 and have everything to prove.

39:36.675 --> 39:39.876
       That makes us two
      very fortunate men.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.591
         Plus, I'm offering you
            a raise, myself.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.663
        (paper rustling)

40:03.068 --> 40:05.135
     A three percent raise?

40:05.137 --> 40:08.705
      Hey, we're city employees,
          what'd you expect?

40:12.978 --> 40:14.511
     Can I think about it?

40:14.513 --> 40:16.813
  Can you do it over a drink?

40:16.815 --> 40:18.481
     I do my best thinking
           that way.

40:20.952 --> 40:22.852
                        Garrett:
              Just a heads up...

40:24.589 --> 40:27.991
    ...When you're offering
 a measly three percent raise,

40:27.993 --> 40:29.559
       You don't through
        the whole shtick

40:29.561 --> 40:31.895
   Of writing the number down
      on a piece of paper.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.963
         Is that right?

40:35.867 --> 40:37.484
                      Yes.

40:37.485 --> 40:39.102
              See?
  What would I do without you?
