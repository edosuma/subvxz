WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.672
- Tonight, a quest for
redemption fuels the Forge.

00:04.705 --> 00:07.441
Four former competitors
whose mistakes sent them home

00:07.475 --> 00:09.710
return for a chance
to rewrite history

00:09.743 --> 00:11.612
and take home $10,000.

00:11.645 --> 00:13.214
- Yes!

00:13.247 --> 00:16.117
[dramatic rock music]

00:16.150 --> 00:20.488
*

00:23.257 --> 00:24.592
- I'm James Hughes.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.094
The first time I was here,

00:26.127 --> 00:27.828
I noticed a crack on my knife

00:27.861 --> 00:29.630
and hoping that it wasn't
detrimental,

00:29.663 --> 00:31.599
I tapped it on my anvil
and it broke.

00:31.632 --> 00:34.302
I'm back on because
I don't want to be the guy

00:34.335 --> 00:36.504
that gets remembered for doing
something stupid.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.572
- My name is Morgan Medlen.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.608
Last time I came,
I got all the way to the end,

00:40.641 --> 00:42.543
but then my blade broke.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.078
[sighs]

00:44.112 --> 00:45.313
They couldn't test my blade,

00:45.346 --> 00:46.780
which kind of sucked.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.382
I really want to come back
and win

00:48.416 --> 00:49.483
because I know
what my skill set is

00:49.517 --> 00:50.651
and I'm ready to battle.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.086
- My name is Erich Wollet.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.287
Last time on "Forged in Fire,"

00:53.321 --> 00:55.189
I went home in the first round.

00:55.223 --> 00:58.526
- We noticed some micro cracking
on the surface.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.294
- I knew the mistakes
that I made last time.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.662
I knew them as I was making it.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.731
[chuckles]
So this time, I know that

01:03.764 --> 01:05.699
I am not going home first.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.868
- My name is Earl Blackmore.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.738
First time I was on, I had never
used a coal forge before.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.374
Think I may have made
a tactical error.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.244
I just didn't get a chance to
really show what I could do.

01:16.277 --> 01:19.147
Me and the coal forge have had
a few go-arounds since then,

01:19.180 --> 01:22.216
so I know I have a shot to
actually win this thing.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.286
- Bladesmiths,
welcome back to the Forge.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.488
This is a redemption challenge.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.757
Each of you suffered
excruciating losses

01:29.790 --> 01:32.160
in your respective competitions
that sent you home

01:32.193 --> 01:33.761
without the title of
"Forged in Fire" champion

01:33.794 --> 01:35.596
or that 10 grand.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.898
But because you all showed skill
and tenacity,

01:37.931 --> 01:39.700
you've been given another
opportunity

01:39.733 --> 01:41.502
to compete for those things

01:41.535 --> 01:42.903
in front of our panel
of expert judges--

01:42.936 --> 01:45.339
world-famous bladesmith
Jason Knight,

01:45.373 --> 01:48.342
historic weapons recreation
specialist David Baker,

01:48.376 --> 01:50.844
and edged weapon specialist
Doug Marcaida.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.613
All right, gentlemen,

01:52.646 --> 01:54.748
you'll notice that your anvils
are bare.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.718
The only steel that we'll be
offering you today

01:57.751 --> 02:02.156
will be in the form of...

02:02.190 --> 02:04.225
Jackhammers.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.560
- Holy [bleep], holy [bleep],
holy [bleep].

02:06.594 --> 02:09.330
I've never worked with
a jackhammer before.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.764
Never taken one apart,

02:10.798 --> 02:12.500
so that scares the crap
out of me.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.268
- In this first round
of competition,

02:14.302 --> 02:15.903
you'll be forging blades
in your signature style

02:15.936 --> 02:18.739
using steel from these
jackhammers.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.774
Keep in mind that in the second
round you'll be putting

02:20.808 --> 02:22.443
handles on your blades
to turn them into

02:22.476 --> 02:23.844
fully functional weapons

02:23.877 --> 02:25.479
that will then be tested
for strength

02:25.513 --> 02:27.381
in a vertical log chop

02:27.415 --> 02:30.418
and for edge retention
in a fish slice.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.952
You will have ten minutes
to work on your design.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.222
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.823
Good luck, bladesmiths.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.925
Your ten-minute design window
starts... now.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.593
*

02:39.627 --> 02:41.462
These guys have been given

02:41.495 --> 02:43.697
entire handheld jackhammers.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.867
I'm guessing the bit itself
is usable metal.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.437
- That's what I would use.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.372
- I don't believe
that my focus last time

02:51.405 --> 02:53.574
was 100% on competing.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.643
I think my focus was on
the experience.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.711
So this time I'm here to win.

02:57.745 --> 03:01.615
My design is a hybrid
kukri-bowie.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.752
The kukri is going to give me
the best chopping ability,

03:04.785 --> 03:07.855
and the bowie hybrid is gonna
give me a better slice.

03:07.888 --> 03:08.922
- Think they're struggling
to get the bits out

03:08.956 --> 03:11.359
of these jackhammers.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.593
- Yeah, I wonder what's gonna
happen when they start forging.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.462
- [laughs]

03:14.495 --> 03:15.796
- [laughs]

03:15.829 --> 03:16.864
- You son of a--
- I got it.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.699
- [laughs]

03:18.732 --> 03:20.934
- I'm planning on making
a competition chopper.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.836
It would easily handle
chopping wood

03:22.870 --> 03:25.639
and should take a fish out,
no problem.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.675
Last time I just kind of was in
a full panic.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.510
So this time I think I'm just
gonna try and maintain

03:29.543 --> 03:30.944
a little bit more composure

03:30.978 --> 03:32.613
and I think I'll do
a lot better.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.282
- I think I was invited back
to compete

03:34.315 --> 03:36.984
because I'm beautiful.
[laughs]

03:37.017 --> 03:38.752
Coming back for a redemption--

03:38.786 --> 03:40.721
it's three different guys,

03:40.754 --> 03:42.856
brand-new different challenge,
anything's possible.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.492
I'm gonna make a competition
chopper

03:44.525 --> 03:46.527
because it's gonna
take a beating

03:46.560 --> 03:48.262
and it has a little bit of
curve to the edge

03:48.296 --> 03:50.631
for slicing.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.500
*

03:52.533 --> 03:54.001
- My design is--
it's kind of a hybrid

03:54.034 --> 03:55.569
between, like,
a competition chopper

03:55.603 --> 03:57.505
and, like, a Persian-style
dagger.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.607
I wanted something with
the recurve in the blade

03:59.640 --> 04:01.475
because it cuts better
like that.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.411
I definitely don't want to
just luck out.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.279
I really want to come back
and show everybody

04:05.313 --> 04:07.748
that I can do this based on
my skill set alone.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.783
*

04:09.817 --> 04:12.052
- Bladesmiths, your ten-minute
design window has closed

04:12.085 --> 04:15.356
Your three-hour forge time
starts... now.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.525
*

04:17.558 --> 04:19.360
- [humming]

04:19.393 --> 04:21.028
- Morgan's out like
it's the Kentucky Derby

04:21.061 --> 04:23.331
and he wants to be the leader
around the track.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.698
- But you know what?
The road to redemption

04:24.732 --> 04:26.500
begins at a frantic pace.

04:26.534 --> 04:28.302
- I know that
there's enough steel

04:28.336 --> 04:30.003
in the chisel itself
to make a blade.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.473
So my first thing is
get it in the forge.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.542
As that's heating up, I can
then work on other things

04:34.575 --> 04:35.976
like ripping apart
the jackhammer

04:36.009 --> 04:37.345
and figure out
what's on the inside

04:37.378 --> 04:39.313
and if it's any better.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.948
- We're gonna take this off
and try smashing this.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.851
I don't know if I've got
a better piece of steel

04:43.884 --> 04:45.753
inside, in the hilt.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.888
Dude, look at that.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.857
We decided to team up.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.659
Please hold that for me.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.026
Morgan, Earl, and I are tackling
that jackhammer,

04:53.060 --> 04:55.329
and then James is going to be

04:55.363 --> 04:56.797
testing the bit to see if it's
something that's workable.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.399
- There's only one other part of
that machine

04:58.432 --> 05:00.033
that I know is hardened steel

05:00.067 --> 05:02.870
and that's the cam inside
that drives the bit.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.438
- They call that "leave her."

05:04.472 --> 05:05.573
Leave her in there.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.409
[laughter]

05:08.442 --> 05:11.379
- As we crack
this jackhammer open...

05:11.412 --> 05:13.581
- Is it solid?
- No, it's not.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.616
We find nothing.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.884
- Guys, hey.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.051
I do the spark test.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.820
Looking for lots of sparks.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.455
Lot of little fingers coming off
the sparks.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.690
It test good.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.425
Hey, both the shaft and the bit

05:24.458 --> 05:25.726
spark test like
a [bleep] sparkler.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.495
- Beautiful.
- Done.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.397
We're done. That tells us.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.732
Everybody's chosen the bits.
That's smart.

05:31.765 --> 05:32.900
- It looks like
it's good quality steel,

05:32.933 --> 05:34.001
but we'll see.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.036
*

05:36.069 --> 05:37.938
- Pretty confident that I have
enough material

05:37.971 --> 05:39.807
to achieve the shape of knife

05:39.840 --> 05:41.575
that I'm trying to make.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.577
So I cut off the sides
of the bit

05:43.611 --> 05:45.546
to make it easier
to draw it out.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.448
- That's not a good move.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.383
Lot of times, these guys will
cut off steel

05:49.417 --> 05:51.151
and then need it later on.
- Right.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.121
When Earl was here,
we watched him cranking

05:54.154 --> 05:56.857
that coal forge
for three hours.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.892
- Come on, buddy.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.794
- It looks like Earl's fire
went out.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.596
- It's not looking good.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.164
- Hey, Earl!

06:04.197 --> 06:06.066
You want us to bring in
the coal forges now?

06:06.099 --> 06:08.168
- Dude, I trained my [bleep] off
on those things

06:08.201 --> 06:09.703
before coming here.
- [laughter]

06:09.737 --> 06:11.872
- Hammering behind you.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.074
*

06:14.107 --> 06:16.644
- Now, Erich, I think,
has done a great job

06:16.677 --> 06:18.712
of forcing that blade down
and drawing it out.

06:18.746 --> 06:22.115
So now he's got a nice wide
piece of steel.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.984
- Last time,
at this point right here,

06:24.017 --> 06:25.719
I was beating my head
against the wall

06:25.753 --> 06:27.488
trying to split my stock.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.423
- That's probably
the most difficult way

06:29.457 --> 06:31.559
to do this type of weld.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.761
- I was making mistakes

06:33.794 --> 06:35.796
and not changing my course
of action.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.065
I know that if I screw up,
or something happens,

06:38.098 --> 06:39.900
I'm off first again,

06:39.933 --> 06:41.969
and that is a pill
I do not want to swallow.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.737
- You have only two hours
remaining

06:43.771 --> 06:45.506
to finish your work!

06:45.539 --> 06:46.874
*

06:46.907 --> 06:48.542
- It's moving good.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.711
Everything's working out
the way it should

06:50.744 --> 06:52.513
and I've already got the thing
curving in the right direction.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.181
- James is peeling off layers.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.883
- The temperature is getting
a little warm.

06:55.916 --> 06:56.917
- Whoa! Get a tan!

06:56.950 --> 06:59.119
- My eyes! Ah!

06:59.152 --> 07:01.555
- Welding!
- [laughter]

07:01.589 --> 07:03.190
- Oh, that's good.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.626
- Right now, I was still
pretty good last time.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.961
It was when I got to the grinder
was when I had the problem.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.830
My eye catches
a little dark line.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.665
[grinder whirring]

07:11.699 --> 07:13.066
You know right away
it's a crack.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.068
Coming back, I've had two years

07:15.102 --> 07:17.037
to hone a little bit
of my skills.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.740
Whether I have or not in
the right areas is one thing.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.942
But it's not for the judges,
it's for myself

07:21.975 --> 07:23.844
to see just how far
I can actually make it.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.513
*

07:25.546 --> 07:27.014
- One of the things
that I'm good at

07:27.047 --> 07:28.549
is working quickly.

07:28.582 --> 07:29.750
- Morgan already on the grinder

07:29.783 --> 07:31.685
shaping his blade.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.887
- I'm leaps and bounds
ahead of everyone else.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.623
They're still tinking around,
flattening out their material,

07:35.656 --> 07:37.658
and I'm grinding.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.993
- Morgan is one of
our youngest smiths.

07:40.027 --> 07:43.196
Kid killed it
until he got to the finale.

07:43.230 --> 07:47.034
- I actively see holes
in your sword.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.702
For safety reasons,

07:48.736 --> 07:50.671
we will not be able
to test your sword.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.606
- Since the last time
I was on the show,

07:52.640 --> 07:54.642
I've really, really learned
a lot about bladesmithing.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.109
I'm definitely gonna be
a much tougher opponent

07:56.143 --> 07:57.745
this time around
than last time around.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.881
[humming]

08:00.914 --> 08:03.216
Man, that's gonna suck
if I get sent home today.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.885
Right behind you.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.954
- You have only 90 minutes
remaining!

08:06.987 --> 08:09.923
And then one of you
will be going home!

08:09.957 --> 08:11.559
- [laughing]

08:11.592 --> 08:13.160
- Again!
- [laughs]

08:13.193 --> 08:14.595
[laughter]

08:14.628 --> 08:16.997
*

08:17.030 --> 08:19.567
- I realize that
I'm drawing my steel out

08:19.600 --> 08:21.969
thinner than the parameters that
I'd set for myself originally.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.237
So I need to alter my game plan.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.006
- That looks good, dude.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.775
- Might turn out a little bit
skinny,

08:27.808 --> 08:29.643
but I think it's still
got enough to do the job.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.979
I'm gonna rely more
on blade geometry than mass

08:32.012 --> 08:33.981
to meet the challenge.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.717
- Is there a clear leader
at this time, Dave?

08:36.750 --> 08:38.251
- Yeah, Morgan's in the front.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.887
- And is there anybody
we need to worry about?

08:39.920 --> 08:42.155
- James.
- Why do you say that?

08:42.189 --> 08:44.257
- Steel's just sitting around
on his anvil.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.159
- I'm letting my steel cool down
long enough

08:46.193 --> 08:48.228
so that I can, uh, handle it.

08:48.261 --> 08:51.331
Last time I used water

08:51.364 --> 08:53.867
to try to cool off my handle
enough to start grinding.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.937
And it was still much too hot
for me to put in water.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.338
I was just trying to cool off
the handle enough

08:58.371 --> 09:01.174
for me to hold it,
and I got the crack.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.611
*

09:03.644 --> 09:05.913
That sucker broke like glass.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.981
This time I'm going to be
a lot more careful

09:08.015 --> 09:09.917
about how I cool off my steel.

09:09.950 --> 09:13.220
*

09:13.253 --> 09:15.222
- My major concern right now is,
of course, heat treat.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.590
It's always finicky.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.058
I'm gonna be heat treating

09:18.091 --> 09:19.960
almost an hour before
everyone else.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.262
- Morgan's got a really serious
recurve.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.064
Yeah, it looks cool, but

09:24.097 --> 09:26.900
the problem with making a blade
so extreme

09:26.934 --> 09:29.236
is it limits its ability

09:29.269 --> 09:31.238
to do certain tasks.

09:31.271 --> 09:34.107
- The design doesn't lend itself
well for chopping wood.

09:34.141 --> 09:37.077
- Yeah, it's more suited
for killing orcs and goblins.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.378
- Yes.
- And that's a big thing.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.948
It's not just about
making a blade.

09:40.981 --> 09:44.017
It's about making an effective
blade for the test,

09:44.051 --> 09:46.754
regardless of your
signature style.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.388
Morgan just quenched.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.824
- Whoa! Whoa!
We got a fire already.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.660
*

09:52.693 --> 09:54.061
- Quench it,
test it with a file,

09:54.094 --> 09:57.197
and it's not skating off at all.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.165
[bleep].

10:00.768 --> 10:02.402
So I'm just trying
to heat the blade up

10:02.435 --> 10:03.403
a little bit hotter,

10:03.436 --> 10:07.007
and try again.

10:07.040 --> 10:11.344
*

10:11.378 --> 10:13.246
Second quench and...

10:13.280 --> 10:15.983
yet again, it does not get hard.

10:16.016 --> 10:19.052
[bleep].
- Morgan looks upset.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.254
- Our blades, they're all made
out of the same material

10:21.288 --> 10:24.257
and it's not hardening at all.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.326
This [bleep] doesn't harden.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.828
- Oh, my God.

10:27.861 --> 10:28.796
- We're all [bleep].

10:31.231 --> 10:32.733
- [bleep].

10:32.766 --> 10:35.035
- So Morgan's very, very
confused

10:35.068 --> 10:38.806
about why his blade isn't
hardening like he wants it to.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.340
- I have to try and figure out

10:40.373 --> 10:41.975
how to harden this blade,

10:42.009 --> 10:43.343
otherwise it doesn't really
count.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.179
- Some steels do not harden

10:46.213 --> 10:48.381
harder than files.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.317
- This is Morgan's third quench.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.053
You're very right that this
steel is hardening up,

10:53.086 --> 10:55.255
but not hardening
to the level of a file

10:55.288 --> 10:56.924
so the file's still biting in.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.692
- Now he's quenching over
and over

10:58.726 --> 10:59.459
trying to get it harder.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.062
*

11:02.095 --> 11:03.463
- I pull it out again

11:03.496 --> 11:04.932
I file test it

11:04.965 --> 11:06.066
after the third quench

11:06.099 --> 11:08.235
and we're still screwed.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.470
- That blade's hard, he just
doesn't know it's hard.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.706
- Sure, it's grabbing
some material,

11:12.740 --> 11:14.374
but it's still moving across;
it's not just digging in.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.009
- I just quenched it
three times,

11:16.043 --> 11:18.145
and it doesn't [bleep]
skate a file.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.048
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Come here.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.050
- Oh, my God.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.352
I literally turned white.
What do we do now?

11:25.385 --> 11:27.020
We don't have enough time
to make another blade.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.456
If we do, it's gonna be
a whack-and-hack.

11:29.489 --> 11:32.092
- [whistles]
This [bleep] doesn't harden.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.161
- This is what we call
spreading bad information.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.729
- I just quenched it
three times in a row.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.998
The file bites into it.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.333
- Morgan's going to talk
to the other bladesmiths

11:40.367 --> 11:43.804
as if we gave them non-hardening
steel, and that's not the case.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.205
- It's not the case.
- I don't know what--

11:45.238 --> 11:47.174
I don't know
what to do right now.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.508
I'm gonna finish out what I got
and see what happens.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.510
I'm still gonna quench it.
Got to.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.979
Part of the rules.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.380
- Going in.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.850
*

11:56.884 --> 11:57.885
- Erich quenched.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.854
*

12:00.888 --> 12:02.322
- My quench comes out

12:02.355 --> 12:03.791
and my colors look great.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.093
Mine feels good so far.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.361
I think I got it.
Mine hardened okay, dude.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.529
I wouldn't say
it was hard, hard,

12:09.562 --> 12:11.031
but it skated.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.766
*

12:12.800 --> 12:14.167
- Earl just quenched.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.435
- I do the quench.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.937
I get a little bit of warpage

12:16.970 --> 12:18.338
[bleep], [bleep],
[bleep], [bleep].

12:18.371 --> 12:20.107
It was initially
pretty alarming,

12:20.140 --> 12:22.409
but Morgan's experience
with his steel,

12:22.442 --> 12:24.144
what I was predominantly worried
about

12:24.177 --> 12:25.445
was the hardness.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.080
I mean, it's biting.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.349
Think it hardened at all?
- Nope.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.052
- If this blade tries to chop
wood and it's not hardened,

12:32.085 --> 12:34.054
it's going to fail the test.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.389
If my knife fails the test,
that means I'm going home.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.926
So I decided to test it
in the acid.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.894
- That, actually,
was very smart.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.329
The hardened steel is going to
color up different

12:42.362 --> 12:43.931
than the softer steel.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.365
- Wow.
- Something happened.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.268
I can see that where I stopped
my quench

12:48.301 --> 12:51.204
there is a discernible
difference between the steel.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.006
Might not have gotten hard
enough, but we'll never know

12:53.040 --> 12:54.808
until we actually test it out.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.476
*

12:56.509 --> 12:58.578
- James, his blade's in the oil.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.148
- [bleep] yeah.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.582
- I haven't seen him
check the hardness.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.251
- He didn't get the memo.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.986
He doesn't care.
He's not even checking.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.454
- I don't file test my blade.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.322
I'm pretty confident
that it's hard.

13:09.356 --> 13:10.490
- Five minutes, bladesmiths.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.359
*

13:12.392 --> 13:14.327
Everybody's blade is hardened

13:14.361 --> 13:17.364
and Morgan still seems really
unhappy with what he's got.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.399
- Did you water quench it?

13:19.432 --> 13:21.101
You really brave enough
to go with water?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.436
- I don't [bleep] know.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.306
- Don't do it.
Don't do it.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.074
- [bleep].

13:29.042 --> 13:30.911
We all used the same material

13:30.944 --> 13:32.946
and that puts us all
on a level playing field

13:32.980 --> 13:34.481
so I'm just gonna try
and work with what I've got.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.349
- Ten, nine,

13:36.383 --> 13:38.385
eight, seven,

13:38.418 --> 13:40.320
six, five,

13:40.353 --> 13:42.089
four, three,

13:42.122 --> 13:44.591
two, one.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.961
Bladesmiths, shut
down your machines!

13:47.995 --> 13:50.163
- The last time, my
fate was pretty much sealed.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.199
Now I'm wondering if I'm gonna
make it to the next round

13:52.232 --> 13:54.968
and it's an entirely different
feeling.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.970
- Well, bladesmiths,

13:57.004 --> 13:59.406
now it's time for the judges
to look at your work.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.208
Earl, you're up first.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.876
*

14:02.910 --> 14:04.377
- Right off, I love that shape.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.512
That's a great shape.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.380
There are issues with

14:07.414 --> 14:10.017
how straight this blade is
and how it's ground.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.618
It's pretty lean.

14:11.651 --> 14:14.187
You don't have a lot of material

14:14.221 --> 14:16.189
to work with to make changes,

14:16.223 --> 14:19.092
but all in all,
I really like the design.

14:19.126 --> 14:23.330
- Thank you.
- Erich, you're up.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.066
- Well, Erich,
I like your blade shape.

14:26.099 --> 14:29.069
I hope your handle doesn't get
any skinnier than this.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.071
'Cause it's gonna be
more difficult

14:31.104 --> 14:32.639
to hang onto if it does.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.574
*

14:34.607 --> 14:37.144
- Morgan, you're up.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.012
- I think your grinding's
beautiful.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.414
Quenching as many times
as you did,

14:41.448 --> 14:42.950
was never going to make
that steel

14:42.983 --> 14:44.617
as hard as you wanted it
to become.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.053
The bigger problem, though,

14:46.086 --> 14:47.921
there's a lot of curves.

14:47.955 --> 14:52.559
Your tip is way below alignment
with the handle.

14:52.592 --> 14:57.397
And I don't know how well
it will function in our tests.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.465
- James.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.035
- I see a beautiful-looking
blade.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.537
I don't see any issues,

15:04.571 --> 15:06.606
except for that one part
right there,

15:06.639 --> 15:10.944
but you did allow for some
thickness over here to correct.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.512
Good job.
- Thank you.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.114
- Well, bladesmiths,

15:14.147 --> 15:15.215
the judges have a decision
to make.

15:15.248 --> 15:19.286
*

15:19.319 --> 15:20.253
- [sighs]

15:22.655 --> 15:25.358
- Let's just jump right in.
We'll start with Erich.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.659
*

15:26.693 --> 15:28.095
- I like that this blade's

15:28.128 --> 15:29.729
made for chopping.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.264
The only issue for me is

15:31.298 --> 15:33.266
a little bit on his handle here.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.667
A little bit on the long side.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.403
He can still grind it off;
fix that.

15:36.436 --> 15:40.507
- All right, let's move on
to James.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.309
- He made a straight-up chopper.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.011
This just wants to go to work.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.613
I'd take this out
as a bush knife any day.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.049
- He's got a little fold over
in here.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.184
Could it cause a failure?
Possibly.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.186
- All right, let's move on
to Morgan's blade.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.022
*

15:55.055 --> 15:56.189
- He's got a lot of skill.

15:56.223 --> 15:58.058
We know he can forge a blade

15:58.091 --> 15:59.759
and show us
these beautiful shapes.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.629
The problem is, when you're
gonna use his weapon,

16:02.662 --> 16:04.697
this is the only place it's
gonna be chopping with.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.599
Having this particular curve

16:06.633 --> 16:09.469
forces me to use only one area.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.172
The question is,
in comparison to the others,

16:12.205 --> 16:14.707
which lends itself more
to performance?

16:14.741 --> 16:17.410
- All right, let's move on
to Earl's blade on the end.

16:17.444 --> 16:18.478
- Looks like your knife there.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.412
- Ah, [bleep].

16:19.446 --> 16:21.314
[laughter]

16:22.549 --> 16:24.451
- This has got a very nice
shape to it,

16:24.484 --> 16:26.353
but there's a lot going on here.

16:26.386 --> 16:27.754
To get this straightened out,

16:27.787 --> 16:29.689
to get those grinds evened out,

16:29.722 --> 16:32.392
you don't have a lot of
material to work with

16:32.425 --> 16:33.626
to make changes.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.695
Would he wind up with a blade

16:35.728 --> 16:37.564
that's just too light for
the challenge we're asking for?

16:37.597 --> 16:38.698
It's a possibility.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.200
- All right, gentlemen,

16:40.233 --> 16:41.601
have you made your final
decision?

16:41.634 --> 16:43.036
- Yep.
- Let's go tell our smiths.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.172
*

16:45.205 --> 16:46.773
- Bladesmiths, for one of you,

16:46.806 --> 16:49.542
the road to redemption ends
right here.

16:49.576 --> 16:53.546
The bladesmith leaving
the Forge is...

16:53.580 --> 16:55.248
Morgan.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.450
Your blade did not make the cut.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.720
- Morgan, we all appreciate the
work you put into that blade,

17:00.753 --> 17:03.123
but because no one had a
critical issue in their blade,

17:03.156 --> 17:05.258
what the decision
came down to was

17:05.292 --> 17:08.795
the design of that blade
for our specific tests.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.664
The extreme recurve
of your blade

17:11.698 --> 17:14.367
is a design that will make it
much more difficult to control

17:14.401 --> 17:16.169
and for a log chop challenge,

17:16.203 --> 17:18.538
moving forward, that's something
you couldn't fix

17:18.571 --> 17:20.540
and that's why
we're letting you go.

17:20.573 --> 17:24.077
- Morgan,
please surrender your blade.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.346
- I understand what
the judges are saying.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.115
I'm just kind of disappointed
in myself

17:28.148 --> 17:29.749
for coming and doing this again

17:29.782 --> 17:32.119
and doing worse
than what I did last time.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.421
I mean, 'cause I was ready
to go all the way to the end.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.489
I might not be the
"Forged in Fire" champion,

17:36.523 --> 17:38.858
but I still feel like I'm
a pretty kick-ass bladesmith

17:38.891 --> 17:42.862
and ready to go
keep making knives.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.697
- Bladesmiths, in this round
of competition,

17:44.731 --> 17:47.167
you'll be taking your blades
and turning them into

17:47.200 --> 17:49.469
fully functional weapons
by placing handles on them.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.571
Your finished blades
will be tested

17:51.604 --> 17:54.474
for strength and durability
in a vertical log chop

17:54.507 --> 17:57.410
and for edge retention
in a fish slice.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.246
You will have three hours
in this round.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.614
Oh, and one more thing.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.616
The road to redemption
is never easy.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.319
In this second round of
competition, the only material

18:06.353 --> 18:08.688
that you are authorized to use
on your handles

18:08.721 --> 18:11.491
is bone, horn, or antler.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.260
- I'm just stoked.
That's what I use

18:13.293 --> 18:14.627
for most of my handles.

18:14.661 --> 18:15.762
I mean, it's terrific.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.497
- Your time starts... Now.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.366
*

18:19.399 --> 18:20.533
- If you're gonna come
and redeem yourself,

18:20.567 --> 18:22.269
show us the best work you can.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.636
- Get on in here, brother.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.173
- Ah, crap. [laughs]

18:26.206 --> 18:28.708
I hate using antler,
bone, or horn.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.777
It ain't that sturdy
and durable.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.779
It's just blah.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.747
Finally, I pick out a set
of ram horn scales

18:34.781 --> 18:36.349
and I just set it on my table.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.584
I didn't even really look at it.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.153
- I think we have a winner.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.289
I'm feeling pretty good
because I use antler and horn

18:42.322 --> 18:43.490
on my own knives at home a lot.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.425
I find a piece of round horn

18:45.458 --> 18:46.726
and I know if I cut it in half,
it'll work.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.695
- Let the stink begin.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.697
Horn is grown together
very similar to hair.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.365
There's a lot of strands in it.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.234
That's why it smells
like burnt hair.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.802
- It's like you're doing
a burnout, man. It's cool.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.304
[laughs]

18:57.337 --> 18:58.771
- [laughs]

18:58.805 --> 19:00.707
- Thanks. Thanks for sharing.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.609
- Oh, my God! It's stinky!

19:02.642 --> 19:04.444
- Sorry, man.
- Damn it.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.646
- Is this the most effective way
to cut this horn?

19:06.679 --> 19:08.381
- Absolutely not.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.250
The easiest way
is being demonstrated

19:10.283 --> 19:11.318
by Erich.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.552
- That's a bandsaw.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.886
*

19:13.920 --> 19:15.222
- I've never worked with impala.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.290
Love the feel of it.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.226
I think it's gonna be
a terrific match for my handle.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.760
I got to flatten my scales out,

19:20.793 --> 19:23.763
and the innards fell out.

19:23.796 --> 19:24.797
That ain't no good.

19:24.831 --> 19:25.965
I'm not happy.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.300
Last time I was on,

19:27.334 --> 19:28.701
the mistakes that I made

19:28.735 --> 19:30.403
were not changing
my course of action.

19:30.437 --> 19:31.371
That ain't good.
- No, don't use that.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.240
- So I decide to go back

19:33.273 --> 19:34.507
and see if there's something
different.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.775
- You have two hours remaining

19:35.808 --> 19:37.444
to finish your work!

19:37.477 --> 19:38.945
- That's it.
That's the one I need.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.980
My plan is to use Corby bolts

19:41.013 --> 19:43.616
to fasten my handle scales
with epoxy

19:43.650 --> 19:45.685
because you can screw those
things down tight,

19:45.718 --> 19:48.788
but when I go to fix
the Corby bolts to my knife,

19:48.821 --> 19:50.623
they won't touch.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.393
[bleep].
What the hell is the deal?

19:53.426 --> 19:56.463
I have to shift gears and get
just regular pin stock

19:56.496 --> 19:59.499
and get them in the hole
before my glue starts to set up.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.334
And it's all over me.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.370
I hate sticky fingers.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.372
Do we have any solvent?

20:05.405 --> 20:07.006
*

20:07.039 --> 20:08.941
- Because that horn
didn't work out,

20:08.975 --> 20:12.379
I'm choosing to go with
dyed bone.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.514
Now I need to address my tang.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.616
I got a lot of concerns about
the length of my handle.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.518
I'm taking it down.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.752
Gonna make it a little bit more
user-friendly.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.554
*

20:21.588 --> 20:22.789
- Ow!

20:22.822 --> 20:25.358
God!
- [laughs]

20:25.392 --> 20:26.893
- In this round
the stakes are higher

20:26.926 --> 20:28.728
and I'm feeling
a lot more pressure now.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.430
The judges told me
that my blade's warped

20:30.463 --> 20:32.599
so now I'm trying
to straighten it out.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.667
- Ooh! Ah, ah, ah!

20:34.701 --> 20:36.436
Oh, that makes my skin crawl.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.805
Every time I see people
doing this,

20:38.838 --> 20:40.006
they snap 'em.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.841
Pew!

20:41.874 --> 20:42.942
- If I pull this too far
and break my knife,

20:42.975 --> 20:43.976
it's over with.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.745
- Earl's a big man.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.280
He's putting a lot of pressure
on that blade.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.349
- [grunting]

20:49.382 --> 20:51.284
- Watch out in your eyes, guys.
- Oh, my God.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.789
- This is an extremely stressful
process,

20:56.823 --> 20:59.392
and if I pull this too far and
break my knife, it's over with.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.961
Last time I wasn't able
to have my weapon tested.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.831
- Your blade did not meet the
parameters for this challenge.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.466
- I don't want to be that guy
that breaks his knife

21:06.499 --> 21:08.034
before I can get to that level.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.802
So I'm going to heat
the spine up.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.004
It will better help me to
straighten the blade out.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.673
- A little bit of heat's
all it takes.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.074
- I got a little spot here,

21:15.107 --> 21:17.377
but it's much better
than it was.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.011
- [chuckles]

21:19.045 --> 21:21.348
I usually sharpen my knife
on top of the belt

21:21.381 --> 21:22.715
with the edge facing toward me.

21:22.749 --> 21:23.983
but this is a different grinder

21:24.016 --> 21:26.052
than I have at home.

21:26.085 --> 21:28.020
I can't sharpen my blade
the way I normally do it,

21:28.054 --> 21:30.323
so I'm having to learn
another way.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.991
Mother[bleep].

21:32.024 --> 21:33.059
Last time I handed Dave
and the other guys

21:33.092 --> 21:34.461
a piece of flat bar stock.

21:34.494 --> 21:35.995
- I was actually looking forward

21:36.028 --> 21:37.430
to seeing that shape
you were working on too.

21:37.464 --> 21:38.565
- So this time around,

21:38.598 --> 21:39.599
turning in a finished blade

21:39.632 --> 21:41.368
is real important to me.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.903
- Getting ready
to drill my horn.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.972
So I could get pins set
and get it glued on

21:46.005 --> 21:48.908
and then start putting the final
edge on the blade.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.043
The most crucial thing
that I can do

21:51.077 --> 21:53.580
is get this handle
to where it's comfortable

21:53.613 --> 21:56.583
for the judges to swing
the living hell out of it.

21:56.616 --> 21:57.850
*

21:57.884 --> 21:59.486
I mix up the epoxy.

21:59.519 --> 22:01.354
I put it on the bone
and the tang.

22:01.388 --> 22:03.456
Uh-oh. Oh, no.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.057
That pin don't fit.

22:05.091 --> 22:08.395
- You didn't check it
before you epoxyed it.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.129
- I don't have much time.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.398
Just a few more seconds
before this epoxy sets.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.965
Son of a bitch.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.834
Got pliers? Tongs? Something?
Anything?

22:14.867 --> 22:16.536
I'm starting to feel the crunch
a little bit.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.937
Come on.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.940
- 15 minutes, bladesmiths!

22:20.973 --> 22:22.775
- I have to finish
putting my pins in

22:22.809 --> 22:24.611
and I need to sharpen my blade.

22:24.644 --> 22:25.978
Setting up.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.080
I realize
my epoxy's not setting.

22:28.114 --> 22:30.883
So I decide to start pinning
my pins over early.

22:30.917 --> 22:33.620
This will ensure that even if
the epoxy doesn't set,

22:33.653 --> 22:35.955
the handle material is held
together by the pins.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.590
Start to feel
a little bit panicky

22:37.624 --> 22:38.958
because time is really
running out

22:38.991 --> 22:40.760
and I still have to sharpen
my knife.

22:40.793 --> 22:41.961
[bleep].

22:41.994 --> 22:43.696
*

22:43.730 --> 22:45.598
- Finally, I took care
of my pins

22:45.632 --> 22:47.900
to fit into the three holes
that I drilled.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.436
So now I'm gonna clean it up

22:49.469 --> 22:51.003
and start making it look good.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.839
I've gotta get this blade
sharpened

22:52.872 --> 22:54.874
and ready to go through logs
and fish.

22:54.907 --> 22:55.875
*

22:55.908 --> 22:57.910
- Ten, nine,

22:57.944 --> 22:59.879
eight, seven,

22:59.912 --> 23:01.914
six, five,

23:01.948 --> 23:04.116
four, three,

23:04.150 --> 23:05.985
two, one.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.520
Bladesmiths,
shut down your machines.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.756
Drop your tools.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.758
- I haven't made it this far
before

23:11.791 --> 23:14.527
and I'm really excited to see
Doug wield my weapon.

23:14.561 --> 23:18.164
But I just really wish I could
have put more of an edge on it.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.166
- This is the strength
and durability test.

23:20.199 --> 23:22.469
I'll be taking your blades
and chopping into

23:22.502 --> 23:25.071
each of these beams
seven times.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.006
Remember, this is not about
what happens to the wood

23:27.039 --> 23:29.509
this is about what happens
to your blade.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.043
James, are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.912
*

23:32.945 --> 23:34.814
Last time I was on,
my blade broke

23:34.847 --> 23:37.083
so I'm thinking in my head,
"Please, please, please,

23:37.116 --> 23:40.086
perform well."

23:40.119 --> 23:43.022
[heavy rock music]

23:43.055 --> 23:48.795
*

23:51.798 --> 23:54.033
- Not bad at all.
- [chuckles]

23:54.066 --> 23:55.735
- I like the blade design.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.570
It lends itself well to cutting.

23:57.604 --> 24:02.108
But there is a little bit
of edge deformation here.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.544
The wire edge is kind of
rolled over a little bit.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.746
- Oh, man.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.081
At this point, there's a chance
that I could be going home.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.150
- Erich, are you ready?
- Let's do it.

24:15.154 --> 24:18.057
[heavy rock music]

24:18.090 --> 24:24.063
*

24:25.998 --> 24:28.968
[laughter]

24:29.001 --> 24:30.703
- Well, Erich, I like
your blade shape.

24:30.737 --> 24:34.273
But when you leave the front
of the handle flat,

24:34.306 --> 24:36.108
but you round off the back,

24:36.142 --> 24:39.211
it is very difficult
to index this knife.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.280
But no damage to your blade.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.916
Well done.
- Thank you.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.051
- Earl, are you ready?

24:45.084 --> 24:46.085
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

24:46.118 --> 24:50.022
*

24:50.056 --> 24:52.959
[heavy rock music]

24:52.992 --> 24:57.530
*

24:58.765 --> 25:00.232
*

25:00.266 --> 25:02.101
Earl, I like the shape
of your knife

25:02.134 --> 25:04.003
and your handle feels
very comfortable,

25:04.036 --> 25:07.206
but the problem is
your edge geometry.

25:07.239 --> 25:08.908
It's pushing its way in,

25:08.941 --> 25:11.043
but it's not really cutting
its way in.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.079
But no damage.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.715
Next up is the sharpness test.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.049
- Bladesmiths,
I'm gonna take your weapon

25:17.083 --> 25:18.985
and slash across these fish.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.788
If it's sharp,
it should glide through.

25:21.821 --> 25:22.955
James, you're up first.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.123
You ready?
- I'm ready, sir.

25:24.156 --> 25:26.726
*

25:26.759 --> 25:28.695
I'm feeling really,
kind of nervous

25:28.728 --> 25:30.096
'cause I don't know how well
it's gonna perform

25:30.129 --> 25:32.999
because of that roll on my edge.

25:33.032 --> 25:39.171
*

25:39.205 --> 25:40.172
- Hell yeah.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.341
*

25:42.374 --> 25:44.176
- When I grabbed on
to your handle here,

25:44.210 --> 25:47.614
it fit nicely, but when I start
moving it this way,

25:47.647 --> 25:50.149
I start to feel the edges
right here.

25:50.182 --> 25:53.119
But it's definitely
sharp enough

25:53.152 --> 25:54.320
to cut through the fish.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.321
Your blade will cut.

25:55.354 --> 25:56.355
- Thank you.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.690
- Erich, you're up.

25:57.724 --> 26:04.664
*

26:09.335 --> 26:11.904
One thing I love about it
is the balance.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.906
There was no drag.
Foom! Felt good.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.042
It felt...

26:16.075 --> 26:17.343
Like I'd chopped something!

26:17.376 --> 26:18.945
[laughter]

26:18.978 --> 26:20.146
So thank you for that
excitement.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.280
The handle is smooth.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.882
There are no rough edges,

26:22.915 --> 26:24.851
and it will cut.
- Thank you.

26:24.884 --> 26:27.920
- Earl, you ready?

26:27.954 --> 26:30.690
- If Earl's knife
slices that fish

26:30.723 --> 26:32.792
and it's as clean as Erich's,
I'm going home.

26:32.825 --> 26:38.965
*

26:38.998 --> 26:40.166
- Earl, your turn.
You ready?

26:40.199 --> 26:41.834
- I'm nervous right now.

26:41.868 --> 26:43.102
I've made a solid knife, but

26:43.135 --> 26:45.638
I think it could be sharper.

26:45.672 --> 26:47.807
*

26:51.310 --> 26:55.915
*

26:55.948 --> 26:58.284
- You have a stunning
and beautiful-looking blade.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.720
The handle, it's smooth,

27:00.753 --> 27:03.022
but you can see some
indentations right here,

27:03.055 --> 27:05.858
which shows that there might be
an area that's not as sharp.

27:05.892 --> 27:07.827
Didn't glide all the way
through.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.428
But your blade will cut.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.063
- Yeah!
Just wanted to hear that.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.732
[laughter]

27:12.765 --> 27:14.100
- With as thin a blade
as Earl had,

27:14.133 --> 27:16.068
it should have been a slicer.

27:16.102 --> 27:17.837
I feel my chances of moving on
to round three

27:17.870 --> 27:19.438
might be looking better.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.841
- Bladesmiths,
it's time for one of you

27:21.874 --> 27:23.309
to leave the Forge.

27:23.342 --> 27:26.846
[dramatic music]

27:26.879 --> 27:28.848
Earl, your blade
did not make the cut.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.717
Jason will explain.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.318
- Earl, you made
a beautiful knife.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.753
I love the shape of it.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.822
You had a good handle on it.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.457
But you just didn't grind it
to produce the kind of edge

27:38.490 --> 27:40.026
that you need to cut with.

27:40.059 --> 27:41.360
When I was doing the log chop,

27:41.393 --> 27:43.830
it was bouncing off of the wood.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.397
It's just not sharp,

27:45.431 --> 27:46.933
and that's why
we have to send you home.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.367
- Understood.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.236
- Please surrender your blade.

27:50.269 --> 27:52.204
- It would have been really
nice to move on

27:52.238 --> 27:54.073
to the final round,
but it just wasn't in the cards.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.042
I had a chance to show
what I could do

27:56.075 --> 27:57.910
and it was way more than I did
the first time

27:57.944 --> 27:59.912
and as far as redemption goes,

27:59.946 --> 28:04.016
that's about as much as
I could ask for right there.

28:04.050 --> 28:07.720
- James, Erich, congratulations,
you're both in the final.

28:07.754 --> 28:10.156
Now you're both one step closer
to redemption,

28:10.189 --> 28:11.858
the title of
"Forged in Fire" champion,

28:11.891 --> 28:14.360
and a check for $10,000.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.328
When you came here, you used
our tools and equipment

28:16.362 --> 28:18.998
to forge signature blades
in your signature style.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.200
Now we're sending you back
to your home forges

28:21.233 --> 28:24.003
to recreate an iconic weapon
from history.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.237
That weapon is...

28:25.271 --> 28:27.840
*

28:27.874 --> 28:28.941
A sword breaker.

28:28.975 --> 28:32.411
*

28:32.444 --> 28:35.214
Used by knights across
16th century Europe

28:35.247 --> 28:37.283
the sword breaker
is a unique dagger

28:37.316 --> 28:40.252
designed to render enemies
defenseless on the battlefield.

28:40.286 --> 28:42.321
The weapon's sharp
comb-like teeth

28:42.354 --> 28:45.124
could entrap and snap
an opponent's sword in half,

28:45.157 --> 28:47.359
while its razor-sharp edge
and tip

28:47.393 --> 28:49.996
were employed to deliver
fatal slashes or stabs.

28:50.029 --> 28:52.298
The sword breaker was
so versatile in its ability

28:52.331 --> 28:54.233
to disarm and counterattack,

28:54.266 --> 28:56.235
it became the standard sidearm
of this day.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.805
Today it's immortalized
in the PlayStation game

28:58.838 --> 29:01.240
"Sword Art Online:
Hollow Fragment"

29:01.273 --> 29:04.243
where it's wielded
by the character Philia.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.779
- Awesome.
Oh, my God.

29:06.813 --> 29:08.247
It's a sword breaker--who gets
a chance to make one of those?

29:08.280 --> 29:10.049
- [laughs]
I have no experience whatsoever

29:10.082 --> 29:11.350
making a sword breaker.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.919
Come on, man. Let's bring it.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.453
- It must be an effective

29:14.486 --> 29:17.256
working version of that weapon.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.191
The blade must include
nine teeth

29:19.225 --> 29:21.894
and have a sharpened edge
and tip.

29:21.928 --> 29:24.063
Additionally, you must have
a cruciform guard

29:24.096 --> 29:27.466
with ring and pommel.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.535
We're sending you back to
your home forges for five days

29:29.568 --> 29:31.070
to complete this challenge.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.504
After five days, you'll return

29:32.538 --> 29:34.440
and present your weapons
to our judges.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.575
Only after they've punished
the hell out of them

29:36.608 --> 29:39.111
will they declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" champion

29:39.145 --> 29:40.479
and hand you that check
for 10 grand.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.014
You guys ready?

29:42.048 --> 29:43.082
- Yes, sir.
- Absolutely.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.250
- Good luck, bladesmiths.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.317
We'll see you in five days.

29:45.351 --> 29:47.453
*

29:47.486 --> 29:50.589
[rock music]

29:50.622 --> 29:53.259
- This is my home forge,
the home of Hughes Knives.

29:53.292 --> 29:56.228
The first time out, I didn't
even get out of round one.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.596
And now to be in the
championship challenge

29:57.629 --> 29:59.098
is unbelievable.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.967
That's what it should look like

30:01.000 --> 30:02.168
whenever I'm finished.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.936
I'm pretty stoked because

30:03.970 --> 30:05.437
I get a chance
to make the weapon

30:05.471 --> 30:07.206
that breaks the weapons
that go into war.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.175
It has very deep cuts
on the spine.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.944
It has a sharpened edge
to make it a dagger.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.380
I'll go to start forging the tip
and see where it goes.

30:14.413 --> 30:17.383
I do really good at drawings.
Blades are another thing.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.385
This blade's gonna have to
withstand a lot of shock.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.188
If a blade were to come down
inside those grooves,

30:22.221 --> 30:24.356
it could cause enough
vibration and enough shock

30:24.390 --> 30:26.225
that it would break my blade,
and that can't happen.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.227
I'm gonna use 5160.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.296
It's a tough steel and it can
take a lot of beating.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.864
I'm pretty happy with that tip.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.532
The biggest struggle tomorrow

30:33.565 --> 30:34.934
is gonna be cutting
all of those teeth in.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.502
I still got a lot of work to do.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.971
Whoo, I'm tired! Yeah, right.
[laughs]

30:39.005 --> 30:42.008
[rock music]

30:42.041 --> 30:43.575
- I'm back in my home forge.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.511
Last time I was on,
I was sent out first, so

30:45.544 --> 30:47.546
to make it through
to the finals, I'm elated.

30:47.579 --> 30:48.915
I'm assuming we're gonna try
to break some swords,

30:48.948 --> 30:50.549
and I'm all right with that.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.218
I'm actually thinking of

30:52.251 --> 30:54.420
going with a club
design for my teeth.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.122
It's giving them
a lot more mass,

30:56.155 --> 30:57.189
a lot more weight,
and a lot more meat

30:57.223 --> 30:59.091
to bite into and to dig,

30:59.125 --> 31:02.128
so hopefully that will prove to
be a good design.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.563
Maybe someday it'll end up
in a museum.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.398
Gonna establish my point.

31:06.432 --> 31:09.535
Kind of narrow that down,
taking the corners in.

31:09.568 --> 31:12.204
I'm making a lot more progress
than I expected,

31:12.238 --> 31:14.340
but the hard part's coming up.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.676
The hard part's gonna be the
meticulous parts of this build.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.678
- Time for day two.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.447
First thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna drill the holes

31:21.480 --> 31:22.915
and then finish cutting
all of those teeth in

31:22.949 --> 31:24.516
before heat treat.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.385
That looks pretty wicked
right there.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.520
I was originally gonna cut these
into a spade look,

31:28.554 --> 31:31.357
but the triangular look
is really bad-ass.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.559
It's gonna save me
a lot of file time.

31:33.592 --> 31:37.429
Oh, so pretty.

31:37.463 --> 31:38.630
I'm gonna let this forge warm up
a little bit.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.399
I gotta go get my quench tank,

31:40.432 --> 31:42.701
then I'll be ready
for a hardening cycle.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.436
I don't usually quench blades
this big,

31:44.470 --> 31:47.073
so it's gonna be difficult.
All right.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.641
I'm heating up some scrap
material to heat the oil.

31:49.675 --> 31:52.078
See if I can't get about
120 degrees in here.

31:52.111 --> 31:53.712
You need to heat up the oil

31:53.745 --> 31:55.481
because you don't want to
shock the steel

31:55.514 --> 31:57.583
while hardening because
it'll potentially crack.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.051
*

31:59.085 --> 32:00.652
Damn it.
Damn it!

32:00.686 --> 32:02.554
What the [bleep]
is going on?

32:02.588 --> 32:04.256
I've gotta--
I'm just fixin' to waste

32:04.290 --> 32:06.692
about two gallons
of [bleep] oil.

32:06.725 --> 32:09.095
[bleep], [bleep].

32:09.128 --> 32:10.362
The steel punches a hole

32:10.396 --> 32:12.631
in the bottom of my PVC cap.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.466
That [bleep] sucks.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.135
I don't know what the [bleep]
to do now.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.037
This is gonna set me back
a half day.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.339
I need to find a quench tank
or I'm done.

32:20.372 --> 32:24.343
*

32:24.376 --> 32:26.312
- I'm ready to get going.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.214
I'm ready to get the teeth
on the blade today.

32:28.247 --> 32:31.417
This is the most critical part
of the build, period.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.385
This is the very first time
I've ever cut into a blade,

32:33.419 --> 32:34.753
other than a gut hook.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.222
I'm gonna hot chisel 'em out

32:36.255 --> 32:38.024
just to see how they look--

32:38.057 --> 32:39.425
make sure that that's
the right decision.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.027
The designs I have for my teeth,

32:41.060 --> 32:42.128
they could go drastically wrong.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.729
Each one of these teeth

32:43.762 --> 32:45.031
are a potential spot
for breaking,

32:45.064 --> 32:47.199
so I have to be very meticulous

32:47.233 --> 32:49.101
on where each placement goes.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.502
I think it's gonna be mean.

32:50.536 --> 32:52.138
With the heat treat,

32:52.171 --> 32:53.072
I don't know what to expect
with it.

32:53.105 --> 32:54.640
I truly don't.

32:54.673 --> 32:57.009
If there's any stress
left in the metal,

32:57.043 --> 32:59.478
it's gonna come out and that is
usually in the shape of a warp.

32:59.511 --> 33:02.081
That's got me
a little concerned, I gotta say.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.749
If anything is gonna make me
throw up today,

33:03.782 --> 33:05.251
it's gonna be the heat treat.

33:05.284 --> 33:11.423
*

33:12.491 --> 33:14.760
That's really good.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.628
They're nice and straight
and they look terrific.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.597
I'm happy.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.432
- I had to find
a different tank.

33:20.466 --> 33:22.501
And finally I found
a metal five-gallon can

33:22.534 --> 33:25.104
and quenched my blade.
It looks really good.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.605
The details I'm working on
today is,

33:26.638 --> 33:29.175
I'm gonna be
finishing the guard.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.243
Shape that up with some files,
make it nice and round.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.679
Shape my handle and do my test.

33:33.712 --> 33:36.348
Ooh, that's nice!

33:36.382 --> 33:39.418
I already have a piece of purple
heartwood for my handle,

33:39.451 --> 33:41.220
and my drills for making
the hole for the guard.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.388
It's gonna now become my pommel.

33:42.421 --> 33:46.192
*

33:46.225 --> 33:48.160
Everything looks great.

33:48.194 --> 33:50.162
Now I have to get the primary
edge sharpened

33:50.196 --> 33:52.164
and then do some cutting tests
on it.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.633
I got my daughters out there
and my tortoise Geo.

33:54.666 --> 33:57.636
They want to see
what this blade can do.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.305
When I was out
in the first round,

33:59.338 --> 34:01.307
my daughters were both sad
for me,

34:01.340 --> 34:03.342
but having this second
opportunity to go back and

34:03.375 --> 34:04.443
show them that if you
really put your mind to it,

34:04.476 --> 34:05.777
you can achieve greatness

34:05.811 --> 34:07.213
feels good to me.

34:07.246 --> 34:08.347
- That was pretty awesome.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.149
- I almost killed Geo.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.220
- Yesterday I spent a lot of
time sharpening that blade.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.758
What I'm doing now is focusing
mainly on the teeth.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.294
We're gonna have to test that
design out right off the bat

34:22.328 --> 34:24.363
to make sure it would hold
and lock a sword in.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.699
Yeah, it locks in well.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.669
This is going to be
a very devastating blade.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.738
I'm happy.
Next is going to be the guard

34:32.771 --> 34:34.173
and the handle.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.774
It'll probably end up being

34:35.807 --> 34:38.110
somewhere in the vicinity
of that.

34:38.144 --> 34:39.611
I have to work on
getting the ring welded on

34:39.645 --> 34:41.713
to where I need it to be.
Whoo!

34:41.747 --> 34:43.515
What I've found so far
for the research,

34:43.549 --> 34:45.417
the teeth were designed
specifically to be

34:45.451 --> 34:47.219
facing in your left hand,

34:47.253 --> 34:48.887
meaning that the guard
and your ring

34:48.920 --> 34:50.389
is gonna cover your knuckles
on the backside.

34:50.422 --> 34:53.225
So I want to keep very period.

34:53.259 --> 34:56.795
Boy, what a hefty piece
to be carrying on you.

34:56.828 --> 34:59.565
*

34:59.598 --> 35:03.235
- James, Erich, you're both
one step closer to redemption.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.570
James, how did it go?

35:04.603 --> 35:06.605
- It was a great weapon
to build.

35:06.638 --> 35:08.840
I chose to do a forge guard
out of wrought iron.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.476
I never forged wrought iron
before.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.511
It was fun.
It was a great--great build.

35:12.544 --> 35:15.181
- Erich, how'd it go for you?
- The build went terrific.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.583
I chose to go with the spring
steel for the blade.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.552
The cruciform guard was out of
a square stock iron.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.221
It was a fun build.

35:22.254 --> 35:23.555
- Now it's time for
our weapons test.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.891
Up first is the kill test.

35:25.924 --> 35:27.893
Doug?

35:27.926 --> 35:30.362
- To see what lethal damage
your blade can do,

35:30.396 --> 35:32.831
I will deliver killing blows
of slashes and thrusts

35:32.864 --> 35:35.167
on this ballistics dummy.

35:35.201 --> 35:37.669
The sword breaker comes from a
style that's called main-gauche,

35:37.703 --> 35:39.538
which means "left hand."

35:39.571 --> 35:41.707
Therefore, I will see
the offensive capabilities

35:41.740 --> 35:44.176
of your knife
with my left hand.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.611
James, you're up first.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.179
You ready?
- Let's do it.

35:47.213 --> 35:48.914
Of course I'm ready.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.782
Been waiting for this moment
for a while

35:50.816 --> 35:51.917
and he's fixing to start
slashing gummy dummies

35:51.950 --> 35:53.285
like crazy.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.387
*

35:55.421 --> 35:58.324
[rock music]

35:58.357 --> 36:04.463
*

36:04.496 --> 36:05.931
[chuckles]

36:05.964 --> 36:07.666
- Well, James,
as an offensive weapon,

36:07.699 --> 36:10.302
it slashes nicely
and punctures easily

36:10.336 --> 36:11.570
for a deep cut,

36:11.603 --> 36:13.472
but at the same time,

36:13.505 --> 36:15.441
I know that sword breakers
have to be held this way.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.743
It wants to go this way.

36:17.776 --> 36:19.278
Nonetheless,

36:19.311 --> 36:21.347
it cuts, it stabs,

36:21.380 --> 36:23.249
and it will kill.
- [chuckles]

36:23.282 --> 36:24.216
- Good job.
- Thank you.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.484
- Erich, your turn.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.319
You ready?
- Yes, sir.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.355
James' blade literally
devastated that dummy,

36:29.388 --> 36:33.725
so I know that I'm gonna have to
at least perform as well.

36:33.759 --> 36:40.699
*

36:43.635 --> 36:46.438
- Well, Erich,
if I need to use it offensively,

36:46.472 --> 36:48.407
it's easy to index
and switch to that edge.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.442
When I did thrust
and slash out,

36:50.476 --> 36:53.412
we got to test the edge
and it lacerates.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.614
Your blade will kill.

36:55.647 --> 36:57.416
- Thank you.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.285
- All right, bladesmiths,
next up

36:59.318 --> 37:00.352
is the sharpness test.

37:00.386 --> 37:01.353
Dave?

37:01.387 --> 37:03.389
*

37:03.422 --> 37:04.490
- Now, to test the sharpness

37:04.523 --> 37:05.957
of the edge of your blade,

37:05.991 --> 37:07.526
I'm going to cut the rope first,

37:07.559 --> 37:09.995
the fish, and then the meat;

37:10.028 --> 37:11.397
our "Forged in Fire" trifecta.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.564
[laughter]

37:12.598 --> 37:13.832
James, you're up first.

37:13.865 --> 37:14.766
You ready?
- Yes, sir.

37:14.800 --> 37:18.270
*

37:18.304 --> 37:21.039
[rock music]

37:21.072 --> 37:25.277
*

37:26.678 --> 37:28.447
[chuckles]

37:28.480 --> 37:29.815
- Hell yeah.
- All right, James,

37:29.848 --> 37:31.049
wicked sharp.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.551
Going from there,

37:32.584 --> 37:33.952
the sword breaker
in particular,

37:33.985 --> 37:35.887
is a left-handed weapon.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.524
Now, that ring
is to protect your knuckles.

37:38.557 --> 37:41.393
*

37:41.427 --> 37:42.928
Oops.
- Yes, sir.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.330
- Other than that,

37:44.363 --> 37:45.631
this thing is a beast.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.333
- Thank you.

37:47.366 --> 37:48.534
- All right, Erich.
- Let's do it.

37:48.567 --> 37:49.501
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

37:49.535 --> 37:52.003
*

37:53.705 --> 37:56.675
[rock music]

37:56.708 --> 38:01.980
*

38:04.115 --> 38:06.752
[laughter]

38:06.785 --> 38:09.688
- All right, first off,
that's sharp.

38:09.721 --> 38:11.723
It just went right through
the rope.

38:11.757 --> 38:14.426
Right through the fish--
didn't cut all the way,

38:14.460 --> 38:15.861
that was me,
not the knife.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.363
You can see the cuts
on that beef.

38:17.396 --> 38:19.064
- Yeah. Sure.
- Just clean.

38:19.097 --> 38:21.032
Straight through.

38:21.066 --> 38:23.435
Knuckle guard
above the knuckles.

38:23.469 --> 38:25.103
Crenulation's forward.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.806
It can catch with that,
stop things--that's great.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.975
All in all, I think it's
a great-looking piece

38:30.008 --> 38:32.678
and it is definitely sharp.
- Thank you.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.380
I was really hoping that it
would have been a--

38:34.413 --> 38:36.448
more of a clean slice
through the fish.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.917
Ultimately, as he turns around,
and the fish fell,

38:38.950 --> 38:41.086
that's how I designed it.

38:41.119 --> 38:43.021
- All right, gentlemen,
this is the strength test.

38:43.054 --> 38:45.457
The sword breaker's teeth
were designed to grab

38:45.491 --> 38:47.659
onto an opponent's weapon
and hold on fast.

38:47.693 --> 38:50.362
Now, to test the strength
and durability of your blades,

38:50.396 --> 38:52.531
we've hooked them into our
mechanical contraption here.

38:52.564 --> 38:54.566
What that piston's gonna do,
it's gonna pull your blade

38:54.600 --> 38:56.402
that way, bending that rapier,

38:56.435 --> 38:58.937
putting a lot of torque
on your blade.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.539
Let's see If the teeth
of your weapon

39:00.572 --> 39:01.907
will hold onto that rapier.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.842
James, you're up first.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.143
You ready for this?
- I'm ready. Let's do this.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.878
I see this contraption,

39:06.912 --> 39:09.615
my heart rate's just jumped up
200%.

39:09.648 --> 39:12.150
I wasn't expecting 2,000 pounds
of pressure.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.786
- Three, two, one. Pull.

39:14.820 --> 39:19.891
*

39:19.925 --> 39:21.693
[air hissing]

39:21.727 --> 39:22.828
- [bleep] damn it, man.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.830
[laughs]

39:24.863 --> 39:25.897
Oh.

39:25.931 --> 39:28.500
*

39:28.534 --> 39:30.168
- Okay.

39:30.201 --> 39:34.973
You picked up
an ever-so-slight bend.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.875
I mean, there was a lot
of pressure on that.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.910
You could actually see
that weapon bending.

39:38.944 --> 39:42.013
You can see what it did
to this rapier blade.

39:42.047 --> 39:44.049
All in all, well done.
- Thank you.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.984
- Erich, your turn.

39:46.017 --> 39:48.487
- Let's put it to the test.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.888
Holy cow.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.089
I know my blade
was built strong,

39:51.122 --> 39:53.692
but if I don't nail this,

39:53.725 --> 39:54.893
I could be going home.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.495
- In three,

39:56.528 --> 39:58.864
two, one.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.968
*

40:03.001 --> 40:04.570
- After seeing how James' blade

40:04.603 --> 40:06.071
is tortured on this one,

40:06.104 --> 40:07.138
I'm nervous.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.874
*

40:08.907 --> 40:12.944
- In three, two, one. Pull.

40:12.978 --> 40:19.918
*

40:23.955 --> 40:27.526
Right, Erich,
what happened in our test here

40:27.559 --> 40:29.895
is the shape of your teeth,
the way they widen

40:29.928 --> 40:31.697
towards the outside...
- Yep.

40:31.730 --> 40:34.666
- Allowed that rapier to twist
and pop out.

40:34.700 --> 40:37.503
As opposed to when you see
these, historically,

40:37.536 --> 40:39.638
they have sort of a head
on these teeth.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.239
- Mm-hmm.
- So once they go into that

40:41.272 --> 40:43.975
section, it's harder for them
to escape.

40:44.009 --> 40:46.878
The fact that this opening here
is so wide,

40:46.912 --> 40:50.482
it's--just allows that
to happen.

40:50.516 --> 40:51.983
- Sure.
- Other than that,

40:52.017 --> 40:53.952
I mean, it held up.

40:53.985 --> 40:56.187
You bent the rapier
right until it popped.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.123
Your blade stayed true,

40:58.156 --> 41:00.125
even after all that flexing,

41:00.158 --> 41:02.661
but those wide teeth seem to be
a bit of an issue.

41:02.694 --> 41:05.063
- My blade grabbed the rapier

41:05.096 --> 41:06.732
and torqued it better than his,

41:06.765 --> 41:08.266
but his sword didn't warp.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.168
Mine did slightly.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.069
So we're still neck and neck.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.804
*

41:12.838 --> 41:14.506
- James, Erich,

41:14.540 --> 41:16.074
this was your shot at
redemption.

41:16.107 --> 41:17.676
However, in this arena
of competition,

41:17.709 --> 41:19.811
there can only be one champion.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.947
The "Forged in Fire" champion
is...

41:21.980 --> 41:25.817
*

41:25.851 --> 41:27.719
James.

41:27.753 --> 41:28.720
- [bleep].

41:28.754 --> 41:30.722
Damn it.

41:30.756 --> 41:32.190
- Congratulations, bud.
- Thank you very much.

41:32.223 --> 41:34.626
- Erich, your blade did not
make the cut.

41:34.660 --> 41:36.261
David Baker will explain.

41:36.294 --> 41:38.564
- Erich, I really like the look
of your blade,

41:38.597 --> 41:40.966
but for a sword breaker
to break a blade,

41:40.999 --> 41:42.568
it has to trap that blade,

41:42.601 --> 41:44.570
and in our test,
that just didn't happen.

41:44.603 --> 41:45.637
That's why we gotta let you go.

41:45.671 --> 41:47.105
- Understand.

41:47.138 --> 41:50.542
- Erich, please surrender
your blade.

41:50.576 --> 41:52.177
- I agree with the judges'
decision.

41:52.210 --> 41:54.913
I have some regrets of choosing
the club pattern

41:54.946 --> 41:57.182
for the blade,
but last episode I was on,

41:57.215 --> 41:59.985
I definitely did not show
what I'm capable of doing.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.821
This time, I was able
to put forward

42:02.854 --> 42:04.089
a competition-worthy blade,

42:04.122 --> 42:06.157
so that's redemption itself.

42:06.191 --> 42:08.293
*

42:08.326 --> 42:10.095
- James, congratulations.

42:10.128 --> 42:11.763
You've redeemed yourself,

42:11.797 --> 42:13.632
and you're the "Forged in Fire"
champion

42:13.665 --> 42:16.201
who also receives that check
for $10,000.

42:16.234 --> 42:18.003
How do you feel?
- Oh, man,

42:18.036 --> 42:20.005
it's been a long road,
I tell you what.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.940
I have redeemed myself.
- All right, James,

42:21.973 --> 42:25.577
please present your weapon
to the judges.

42:25.611 --> 42:27.345
- It's much more fun
to get to present your weapon

42:27.378 --> 42:29.214
to the judges, than having to
surrender it.

42:29.247 --> 42:31.282
Two years ago, being out
in the first round

42:31.316 --> 42:34.620
and making to the championship
round and then now even winning,

42:34.653 --> 42:36.988
man,
it's--this is truly redemption.

42:37.022 --> 42:38.724
My daughters will be proud.

42:38.757 --> 42:40.191
They can tell their friends,
"Hey,

42:40.225 --> 42:41.660
my dad's a 'Forged in Fire'
champion."

42:41.693 --> 42:43.194
[laughs]

42:43.228 --> 42:47.699
