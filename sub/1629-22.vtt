A child who didn't learn
the most basic lesson.

14:44.468 --> 14:47.005
All actions have consequences.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.630
You can kill me, Regina.

14:52.893 --> 14:56.306
But this kingdom will never be yours.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.220
She dies tonight.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.042
What is it? Did you find Snow?

15:25.175 --> 15:26.756
I'm afraid so.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.678
We have to get down there
before it's too late.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.521
I don't think we can.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.696
No!

16:15.892 --> 16:18.725
(WOLF HOWLING)

16:28.822 --> 16:30.733
After my brother passed,

16:30.824 --> 16:35.409
all I could do was relive
that final, terrible moment.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.994
Don't do that to yourself, love.

16:39.416 --> 16:43.750
All we can do in times like these
is try to live in the here and now.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.586
Here and now.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.506
I'm still here.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.760
How is that possible? We saw her die.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.969
Which means I would never be born.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.262
You should've faded from existence.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.468
Exactly.

17:01.646 --> 17:02.761
Well, then perhaps...

17:03.106 --> 17:04.266
She's still alive.

17:04.608 --> 17:06.348
(INSECT BUZZING)

17:06.443 --> 17:08.183
lf Snow is out there, we have to find her.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.234
(BUZZING CONTINUES)

17:10.947 --> 17:13.654
No. Cursed vermin.

17:14.117 --> 17:17.951
We should head back to
the Queen's castle, take a look around.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.778
Perhaps it's a trick by Regina.

17:19.998 --> 17:23.161
No. Whatever happened,
Regina thinks Snow is dead.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.167
Stay still, love.

17:26.254 --> 17:27.460
(INSECT BUZZING)

17:27.547 --> 17:30.038
Wait! Don't harm that thing.

17:31.301 --> 17:32.461
When we were coming to rescue you,

17:32.552 --> 17:35.294
Snow told me what her dust
would do to the Queen.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.676
She said it would turn her into a form
that could easily be squashed.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.014
-A bug.
-(lNSECT BUZZING)

17:40.644 --> 17:42.430
You think Snow turned herself into that?

17:42.520 --> 17:45.853
Well, if she timed it right,
she could've escaped that fireball.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.813
Faked her death and flown away.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.477
Yeah, that's her.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.655
We just need to find a way
to bring her back.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.985
She's saying something.

18:00.497 --> 18:02.829
Wonderful. Anyone fluent in Bug?

18:03.667 --> 18:05.157
BLUE FAIRY: She's calling for me.

18:10.757 --> 18:11.746
Blue.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.832
That's right. And you are?

18:14.177 --> 18:15.383
Leia.

18:15.679 --> 18:16.839
(CHUCKLES)

18:16.930 --> 18:18.591
No, that's not it.

18:19.391 --> 18:22.929
But your secrets can be yours.
I sense it's better that way.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.097
Can you bring Snow back?

18:25.730 --> 18:27.186
Dark magic did this to her.

18:28.191 --> 18:30.182
Light magic can undo it.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.405
-(LAUGH|NG)
-You're alive!

18:38.827 --> 18:39.816
Oh!

18:45.208 --> 18:47.574
It would appear so. Thank you.

18:47.711 --> 18:49.042
RED RIDING HOOD: Snow.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.378
Red.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.798
(LAUGHTER CONTIN U ES)

19:02.892 --> 19:04.553
Looks like we're back on track, love.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.555
Yeah.

19:28.752 --> 19:31.915
I suppose I should, uh, thank you.

19:35.425 --> 19:36.961
You saved me.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.508
Well, it seemed like
the honorable thing to do.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.390
I'm going to the stream
to get some water.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.639
I can fill your canteen, if you like.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.308
Thanks.

19:55.653 --> 19:58.690
They're warming up to each other.
This is good. This will work.

19:58.782 --> 20:01.273
That may be, Swan,

20:01.368 --> 20:03.859
but we have another problem.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.693
EMMA: I had to save her.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.997
Sure, you did the noble thing,
but she's supposed to be dead.

20:09.542 --> 20:13.330
Her presence in the enchanted forest
could have unforeseen consequences.

20:13.463 --> 20:14.873
She's just a sweet, innocent woman.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.455
What if she had a child that grows
into a mass murderer?

20:17.550 --> 20:20.667
Or she gets tipsy some night and
rides a horse into one of the dwarves

20:20.804 --> 20:23.796
and there's only six of them?
Who knows?

20:23.890 --> 20:26.882
And we're best not finding out.
She doesn't belong here.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.135
I know exactly what we can do.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.014
Take her with us.

20:34.651 --> 20:35.857
The future?

20:36.319 --> 20:40.153
You can't stay here.
You were supposed to die hours ago.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.906
I don't understand.
I just want to get back to my family.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.278
They need to believe you're dead.

20:45.370 --> 20:46.826
Because that's what
they've always thought.

20:46.913 --> 20:47.993
Trust us.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.118
All due respect, but I don't trust you.

20:51.209 --> 20:52.289
Or believe you.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.914
So unless you're kidnapping me,
I'm going to go find my family...

20:55.046 --> 20:56.081
(GROANS)

20:56.840 --> 20:59.331
Then, I guess we're kidnapping you.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.166
(LAUGHS)

21:01.761 --> 21:04.377
I always knew there was
a little pirate in you, Swan.

21:04.514 --> 21:06.004
PRINCE CHARMING:
What happened to her?

21:06.349 --> 21:07.384
She's, uh, resting.

21:08.726 --> 21:09.715
What's up?

21:10.353 --> 21:14.096
Have either one of you seen Snow?
She went to the stream but she hasn't...

21:15.942 --> 21:17.807
The ring. She took it.

21:17.902 --> 21:18.937
Really?

21:20.029 --> 21:21.235
Do you know
where she might be headed?

21:21.573 --> 21:23.359
She was seeking passage
on a pirate ship.

21:24.242 --> 21:26.028
There's only one way to get
to the harbor from here.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.108
The Troll Bridge.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.366
-(S|GHS) No.
-Swan, wait.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.038
The Bridge.
Isn't that where you want them to be?

21:32.125 --> 21:34.241
Isn't that where Snow saved
your father from the trolls?

21:34.377 --> 21:35.833
Yes. But the only reason
she was able to do that was

21:35.920 --> 21:37.626
because she had a weapon, the dust.

21:38.882 --> 21:41.669
Which she's already used on herself.
Bloody hell!

21:41.759 --> 21:43.374
Come on. They're gonna need help.

or I'll turn you all into bugs.

Dark fairy dust.

22:59.671 --> 23:03.960

you all off the bottom of my boots.

a reason to forget this ever happened.

23:31.828 --> 23:32.817
(EXHALES)

23:35.873 --> 23:37.579
You saved me.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.665
It was the honorable thing to do.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.666
But how?
You used the dust on yourself.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.001
Mmm... Sand.

23:49.596 --> 23:52.679
Trolls aren't exactly
known for their cleverness.

23:55.018 --> 23:56.883
Come on. We should go.
In case they come back.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.066
Wait.

24:13.411 --> 24:16.027
So, you probably want this.

24:16.748 --> 24:17.737
SNOW WHITE: Right, the gold.

24:17.874 --> 24:20.160
It appears your parents didn't
need our help after all.

24:20.251 --> 24:23.118
And you can't get married without this.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.634
I know. Not your style, right?

24:34.057 --> 24:36.799
Well, there's only one way to find out.

24:46.778 --> 24:48.063
Yeah, not me at all.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.239
I'm sure your fiancee will love it.

24:53.326 --> 24:54.941
It's okay, Swan.

24:56.329 --> 24:59.492
Not everyone gets a chance
to watch their parents fall in love.

24:59.582 --> 25:01.789
Well, wherever you're going, be careful.

25:03.419 --> 25:04.499
If you need anything...

25:04.587 --> 25:06.168
You'll find me.

25:09.592 --> 25:10.957
Always.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.426
I almost believe that.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.432
They're heading away from each other.

25:24.524 --> 25:25.604
No. It's okay.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.649
That's how it happened the first time.

25:28.778 --> 25:30.484
It took my parents a while
to accept their feelings.

25:32.115 --> 25:33.605
HOOK: Must run in the family.

25:46.462 --> 25:47.668
EMMA: Look.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.337
We did it.

25:57.974 --> 26:00.181
Do you know what this is?

26:00.685 --> 26:03.848
This is what happens to people,

26:04.689 --> 26:07.977
or in this case, trolls, who fail me.

26:12.405 --> 26:14.817
Find Snow White.

26:15.992 --> 26:18.825
I shall destroy her happiness,

26:20.413 --> 26:22.825
if it is the last thing I do.

26:29.505 --> 26:30.756
We did it.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.250
Your parents are together?

26:32.341 --> 26:33.956
They're right back on track.
We're ready to go.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.838
| see. And you brought some luggage.

26:37.180 --> 26:38.135
Long story.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.759
So how's the portal coming?
Can you open it?

26:41.768 --> 26:43.178
lcannot

26:46.189 --> 26:47.725
Well, then what are you working on?

26:47.857 --> 26:50.599
This is for me. A forgetting potion.

26:51.027 --> 26:52.813
I know too much about my future.

26:52.904 --> 26:55.771
The only way to protect it is to forget it.

26:55.865 --> 26:57.651
Well, what about this wand?
You said that could help us.

26:57.742 --> 26:58.731
Oh, that.

26:58.868 --> 27:02.702
Well, apparently only those
who used the portal can reopen it.

27:04.040 --> 27:07.703
So unless you can wield magic,
I'm afraid you're going nowhere.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.034
Can you?

27:10.713 --> 27:13.455
-Thought not.
-So you just expect us to stay here?

27:13.549 --> 27:15.710
What about protecting
your precious future?

27:15.802 --> 27:17.417
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

27:18.054 --> 27:19.464
-He means to kill us, Swan.
-(LAUGHS)

27:19.555 --> 27:22.718
No, I mean to put you someplace safe,

27:22.809 --> 27:25.266
someplace even I dare not go.

27:25.394 --> 27:29.353
Where I store the magic that is too dark
or unpredictable, even for me.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.475
Rumplestilt...

27:43.746 --> 27:44.906
No!

27:51.796 --> 27:54.538
Oh. At least he did us one favor.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.131
l'm devilishly handsome again.

28:08.521 --> 28:09.556
Wait. Don't touch anything.

28:09.647 --> 28:12.605
lf Rumple's afraid of this stuff,
there's gotta be a reason.

28:13.943 --> 28:15.228
I'm just trying to figure a way out.

28:15.319 --> 28:16.980
I don't think there is one.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.695
And what's the point? You heard what
he said, we can't reopen the portal.

28:20.116 --> 28:21.151
But you can.

28:22.118 --> 28:26.077
All he said we need is magic.
You're the Savior, Swan, you can do it.

28:26.163 --> 28:27.619
Not anymore. I lost it.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.618
When Zelena died,
all of her spells were undone.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.324
Your powers should've been restored.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.951
Believe me, if I could make it work,
I would. You think I'm faking it?

28:34.046 --> 28:36.037
I think not having magic
makes it a hell of a lot easier

28:36.132 --> 28:38.965
for you to run back to New York
and pretend to be somebody else.

28:40.386 --> 28:43.128
Well, listen to me, Swan, you're not.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.507
It's time to stop running.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.141
You think I don't know that?

28:47.685 --> 28:49.971
Yes, I run away.
That's how I've always survived.

28:50.062 --> 28:53.805
But believe me, I want this to work.
I want to go back.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.811
I want to stop running.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.898
What's changed your mind?

29:03.200 --> 29:04.906
Watching my mother die.

29:07.830 --> 29:10.037
Thinking she was dead.

29:10.166 --> 29:14.956
You saw what happened.
I was so relieved when she was okay.

29:15.046 --> 29:16.832
And I hugged her.

29:17.715 --> 29:20.331
And you know what I saw in her eyes?

29:22.678 --> 29:24.088
Nothing.

29:25.056 --> 29:27.172
She didn't know who I was.

29:28.851 --> 29:31.433
I had saved her and lost her, too.

29:35.066 --> 29:38.183
And that's what I've been doing to her
since I met her.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.361
It's gotta stop.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.446
When Henry brought me
to Storybrooke,

29:44.533 --> 29:45.909
he told me l was the Savior.

29:47.036 --> 29:49.527
I didn't see what he was really doing.

29:50.206 --> 29:53.118
He was not bringing me back
to break a curse.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.917
He was bringing me home.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.715
Neal was right.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.801
About what?

30:07.264 --> 30:10.756
You don't have a home
until you just miss it.

30:11.811 --> 30:14.928
And being with my parents the last few
days, but not really being with them,

30:15.064 --> 30:17.146
I've never missed them more.

30:19.443 --> 30:20.558
Storybrooke.

30:21.654 --> 30:23.610
It's my home.

30:26.951 --> 30:28.066
What?

30:29.245 --> 30:30.325
Look down.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.419
I'd say you've got your magic back.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.911
Now, shall we go?

30:58.357 --> 31:00.973
Yup. Well done, Swan.

31:06.615 --> 31:09.948
-You opened it! Wait.
-Let me go!

31:10.953 --> 31:13.410
My son.
What happens when | find him?

31:13.497 --> 31:14.657
I thought you wanted to forget.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.872
Before I do, I need to know.

31:16.959 --> 31:18.244
Does he forgive me?

31:18.335 --> 31:19.370
Yes.

31:20.046 --> 31:23.379
Yes, but what?
What aren't you telling me?

31:23.466 --> 31:24.876
Tell me or you will never leave.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.377
He dies.

31:28.637 --> 31:31.549
He forgives you. He loved you.

31:33.809 --> 31:37.643
He died to save all of us.
Don't let that be in vain.

31:38.314 --> 31:41.181
I can change what happens.
I can save my boy.

31:41.317 --> 31:44.309
You think you can change the future,
but you might make it worse.

31:47.156 --> 31:49.898
I loved him too. lwanted to save him.

31:52.411 --> 31:56.154
He died a hero,
you can't take that away from him.

31:57.666 --> 31:59.531
You have to drink the potion.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.667
You have to forget
everything I just told you.

32:07.927 --> 32:09.383
(SCREAMING)

32:24.110 --> 32:26.192
What the hell am I doing in here?

32:28.197 --> 32:29.482
(RlNGlNG)

32:35.121 --> 32:36.201
Whoa! (GROANS)

32:40.459 --> 32:41.448
(GRUNTS)

32:46.215 --> 32:47.705
Oh, God!

32:53.430 --> 32:56.092
Do me a favor, fill her in.
Make sure she doesn't freak out.

32:56.225 --> 32:57.431
And where are you going?

32:58.227 --> 33:00.263
l have some people I need to see.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.070
Emma! Hey...

33:16.245 --> 33:18.110
You weren't answering your cell.
We were worried.

33:18.247 --> 33:19.828
I'm fine.

33:20.291 --> 33:21.906
I'm home.

33:23.169 --> 33:25.330
Do you mean that you're not leaving?

33:25.421 --> 33:27.753
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.

33:28.674 --> 33:29.914
We're staying in Storybrooke?

33:30.009 --> 33:34.093
Yeah, kid, this is where we belong.
This is where our family is.

33:36.807 --> 33:37.796
Mom,

33:39.977 --> 33:42.093
Dad, I missed you.

33:49.820 --> 33:51.651
Wait, you're Princess Leia?

33:52.615 --> 33:53.855
Nice alias.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.405
lwas in a pinch.

33:55.492 --> 33:57.403
Well, there you go,
you're officially one of us.

33:57.494 --> 33:59.951
A fairy-tale princess at last.

34:00.039 --> 34:03.452
Yeah, and as my first
princessy request,

34:04.293 --> 34:05.999
I would like to know
the name of the baby.

34:06.128 --> 34:07.868
Right, that.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.169
-Ready?
-Mmm.

34:11.383 --> 34:15.376
Excuse me. If I could have
everyone's attention just for a moment.

34:16.013 --> 34:20.973
This coronation ceremony is something
we've looked fon/vard to for a long time.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.971
The arrival of our new son

34:24.146 --> 34:26.387
has been the cause of greatjoy
for our family.

34:28.150 --> 34:30.641
And we hope you can share in it
as we name him for a hero.

34:31.362 --> 34:35.480
Someone who saved every one of us.

34:37.159 --> 34:39.696
Who we loved and he loved back.

34:42.164 --> 34:43.825
People of Storybrooke,

34:45.376 --> 34:49.244
it is our great joy
to introduce you to our son,

34:50.547 --> 34:52.674
Prince Neal.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.836
(PEOPLE LAUGHING
AND APPLAUDING)

35:11.902 --> 35:14.279
It's so nice to meet you, Neal.

35:32.464 --> 35:36.082
So, do you think
Rumplestiltskin is right?

35:37.094 --> 35:38.925
I'm in the book now.

35:39.054 --> 35:42.888
He said everything besides our little
adventure would go back to normal.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.556
Do you think that it is?

35:44.643 --> 35:48.135
He's right. Othen/vise, l'd remember
that damn bar wench I kissed.

35:49.106 --> 35:50.391
How would that prove anything?

35:51.775 --> 35:54.733
I know how you kiss.
I'd have gone after her.

35:56.071 --> 35:59.734
But I didn't. My life went on
exactly the same as before.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.406
Yeah, must've been the rum.

36:02.578 --> 36:04.739
Everything's back to normal.

36:04.830 --> 36:05.990
You're a bloody hero, Swan.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.619
-So are you.
-(CHUCKLES)

36:09.752 --> 36:11.959
I wanted to thank you, Killian.

36:15.966 --> 36:19.003
For going back for me in the first place
in New York. If you hadn't...

36:19.345 --> 36:21.927
It was the right thing to do.

36:23.807 --> 36:24.922
How did you do it?

36:26.477 --> 36:27.717
How did you get to me?

36:27.811 --> 36:29.517
Well, the curse was coming.

36:29.605 --> 36:31.095
l ditched my crew
and took the Jolly Roger

36:31.190 --> 36:33.272
as fast and as far as I possibly
could to outrun it.

36:33.650 --> 36:34.810
You outran a curse?

36:34.943 --> 36:36.149
I'm a hell of a captain.

36:36.403 --> 36:38.064
Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

36:38.155 --> 36:41.864
And once I was
outside the curse's purview,

36:41.950 --> 36:43.531
I knew that the walls were down.

36:43.619 --> 36:45.029
Transport between the worlds
was possible again.

36:45.496 --> 36:46.702
All I needed was a magic bean.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.328
Those are not easy to come by.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.790
They are if you've got
something of value to trade.

36:52.002 --> 36:53.117
And what was that?

36:53.337 --> 36:55.669
Why, the Jolly Roger, of course.

36:56.673 --> 36:59.130
You traded your ship for me?

37:01.303 --> 37:02.292
Aye.

37:40.884 --> 37:45.503
It is my great honor
to officiate this most lovely union.

37:46.390 --> 37:48.426
If you'd like to begin your vows...

37:50.561 --> 37:52.267
Rumplestiltskin,

37:53.522 --> 37:56.889
this thing we have, it's never been easy.

37:58.026 --> 38:02.190
You know, I've lost you so many times.

38:03.407 --> 38:08.071
I've lost you to darkness, to weakness,

38:09.788 --> 38:12.575
and finally, to death.

38:14.084 --> 38:15.460
But now I realize...

38:16.879 --> 38:21.088
I realize that l have not
spent my life losing you.

38:23.719 --> 38:25.926
I’ve spent my life ﬁnding you.

38:29.808 --> 38:30.888
Belle,

38:32.102 --> 38:33.888
when we met,

38:33.979 --> 38:37.722
lwasn'tjust unloved and unloving.

38:38.901 --> 38:40.812
/ was an enemy of love.

38:43.739 --> 38:45.980
Love had only brought me pain.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.108
My walls were up.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.237
But you brought them down.

38:54.249 --> 38:55.955
You brought me home.

38:57.628 --> 39:00.244
You brought light into my life

39:01.340 --> 39:03.956
and chased away all the darkness.

39:04.092 --> 39:07.255
And / vow to you, / will never forget

39:07.346 --> 39:09.803
the distance between what / was

39:11.517 --> 39:13.098
and what I am.

39:14.686 --> 39:18.520
I owe more to you than I can ever say.

39:20.776 --> 39:23.609
How you can see
the man behind the monster,

39:25.697 --> 39:27.437
I will never know.

39:28.825 --> 39:30.816
But that monster's gone.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.828
And the man beneath him
may be flawed,

39:34.957 --> 39:38.620
but we all are.

39:41.672 --> 39:43.458
And I love you for it.

39:45.175 --> 39:49.043
Sometimes the best book
has the dustiest jacket.

39:50.055 --> 39:52.262
And sometimes

39:52.349 --> 39:55.682
the best teacup is chipped.

40:38.103 --> 40:39.718
Oh, let's sit here.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.402
-lt's the Evil Queen.
-lt's okay.

40:49.531 --> 40:51.067
She's different now.

40:51.199 --> 40:54.157
She's not the same person anymore.
You'll see. l'll...

40:54.244 --> 40:55.950
Just stay here.

40:56.038 --> 40:59.075
Regina, there's
something you should know.

41:00.375 --> 41:01.706
I brought someone back from the past.

41:03.545 --> 41:06.628
This woman,
and she still thinks of you as...

41:07.799 --> 41:08.788
EViI.

41:10.052 --> 41:12.464
I'm gonna bring her over.
I already told her that it's okay,

41:12.554 --> 41:15.216
but it's a little delicate and I feel like
if she met you, she'll see...

41:15.807 --> 41:17.388
I understand.

41:25.442 --> 41:27.148
Regina, I'd like you to meet...

41:27.235 --> 41:28.224
ROBIN HOOD: Marian?

41:29.905 --> 41:31.736
Marian?

41:32.407 --> 41:33.487
Robin?

41:35.577 --> 41:38.364
I thought you were dead.
I thought I'd never see you again.

41:38.455 --> 41:39.570
And I you.

41:43.752 --> 41:44.912
Mama?

41:46.421 --> 41:48.753
Roland? Oh, my baby.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.248
Roland!

41:56.264 --> 41:57.299
You.

42:00.102 --> 42:01.592
You did this?

42:03.480 --> 42:06.187
| just wanted to save her life.

42:07.776 --> 42:09.983
You're just like your mother,

42:10.112 --> 42:11.852
never thinking of consequences.

42:12.906 --> 42:15.272
-I didn't know.
-Of course you didn't.

42:18.286 --> 42:22.199
Well, you just better hope to hell
you didn't bring anything else back.
