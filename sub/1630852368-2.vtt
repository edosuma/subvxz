00:22.648 --> 00:24.942
<i>Just like the way Doug unplugs</i>

00:26.443 --> 00:29.238
All right, Doug. Are your scanners ready?

00:29.321 --> 00:30.864
Scanners ready.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.698
Okay.

00:32.783 --> 00:36.620
I spy with my awesome eye

00:36.703 --> 00:39.248
something…

00:39.831 --> 00:40.791
yellow.

00:43.252 --> 00:46.171
-Yellow doghouse? -No.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.714
-Yellow flower? -Nope.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.843
-Yellow watering can? -Uh-uh.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.595
-Yellow sign? -Guess again.

00:53.679 --> 00:56.515
Wait. Yellow sign? Where?

00:56.598 --> 00:57.891
There's a boy,

00:57.975 --> 00:59.601
and he's got a sign

00:59.685 --> 01:01.687
and a big jug

01:01.770 --> 01:04.313
of something yellow.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.693
Doug, Doug, Doug. It's lemonade!

01:07.776 --> 01:12.948
And it looks like my neighbor Thomas has himself a lemonade stand.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.745
Hey there, Thomas. Meet my best bot, Doug.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.414
Hi, Doug.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.042
You're a real-life robot?

01:24.126 --> 01:26.253
Nice to add you to my memory banks, Thomas.

01:26.336 --> 01:30.090
And you know my name! This is amazing.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.425
I love robots.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.720
And a robot is saying my name.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.054
Wanna try some lemonade?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.182
It's a family recipe.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.808
-Yes, please. -Thank you!

01:42.686 --> 01:43.687
Yes!

01:43.770 --> 01:46.440
I love it when people drink my lemonade and go…

01:48.066 --> 01:50.861
I wanna share all my lemonade with my neighbors.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.488
Thomas is the man with the plan.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.408
How many neighbors have you shared your lemonade with so far?

01:56.491 --> 01:59.620
Two, as in you two.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.830
And I've been here all morning.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.459
I spy a neighbor.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.211
Hey there, Mr. Julius.

02:07.294 --> 02:13.634
Could I interest you in a cup of Thomas's le-le-le-le-lemonade?

02:13.717 --> 02:17.304
Thanks, kids, but lemonade's a little too sour for me.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.516
Plus, I've got a whole tree of sweet oranges to pick before it gets dark.

02:20.599 --> 02:22.726
Here, try one. They're delicious.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.063
See what I mean? I'll never share all my lemonade.

02:26.605 --> 02:27.940
Don't give up yet, Thomas.

02:28.023 --> 02:30.234
There must be another way Em and I can help.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.904
Yeah, we just have to use some creativity.

02:33.987 --> 02:38.575
Creativity. I've never heard that word before.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.869
I'll plug in and find out what it means.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.042
<i>You are creative</i>

02:47.125 --> 02:52.548
<i>When you use your imagination</i>

02:52.631 --> 02:56.468
<i>To do something in a way that's new</i>

02:56.552 --> 02:59.763
<i>Or otherwise original to you</i>

02:59.847 --> 03:01.431
<i>Ideas pop inside your head</i>

03:01.515 --> 03:03.350
<i>Like a song about dogs Art made of bread</i>

03:03.433 --> 03:05.477
<i>You could sing it, solve it Build it, bake it</i>

03:05.561 --> 03:07.479
<i>Think it, then make it That's creative</i>

03:08.397 --> 03:12.234
<i>Creativity, let your mind go</i>

03:12.317 --> 03:15.988
<i>I can't wait to see what you make, oh</i>

03:16.071 --> 03:18.490
<i>Creativity, think and then</i>

03:18.574 --> 03:20.868
<i>Go</i>

03:20.951 --> 03:24.162
<i>Bring your ideas to life</i>

03:24.955 --> 03:25.998
I see.

03:26.081 --> 03:29.459
Creativity is figuring out how to make new things

03:29.543 --> 03:30.878
or think of new ideas.

03:30.961 --> 03:34.214
Only I still have a big question.

03:34.298 --> 03:39.469
How can we find creative ways to help Thomas share all of his lemonade?

03:39.553 --> 03:42.389
There's only one way to find out, ro-buddy.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.974
By getting creative.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.767
Come on, guys.

03:45.851 --> 03:49.688
Let's give out some lemonade!

03:49.771 --> 03:52.107
-Lemonade! -Where do we start?

03:52.191 --> 03:55.027
First we huddle up and put our minds together

03:55.110 --> 03:56.570
in something called…

03:57.988 --> 03:59.823
a brainstorm.

03:59.907 --> 04:03.035
It's like a thunderstorm of creativity.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.953
Bring it in, Team Lemonade.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.080
If we're gonna bring out all the neighbors,

04:07.164 --> 04:10.292
we need a lemonade stand that will make everyone go,

04:10.375 --> 04:13.420
"Wow, what is that amazing thing over there?"

04:13.504 --> 04:16.548
Then when they all come over, bam!

04:16.632 --> 04:18.425
We share that lemonade.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.302
Now, who has an idea?

04:20.886 --> 04:22.262
Thomas, idea. Go!

04:23.555 --> 04:26.767
No, never mind. I got nothing.

04:26.850 --> 04:30.646
-That's okay, Thomas. -Yep, plenty of creativity to come.

04:31.647 --> 04:36.652
What always makes me come out for a tasty treat?

04:38.070 --> 04:40.155
An ice cream truck!

04:40.239 --> 04:43.909
Me too! But I've never heard of a lemonade truck before.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.369
Exactly!

04:45.452 --> 04:48.914
Everyone will have to come see it for themselves.

04:48.997 --> 04:52.334
But where can we get a truck?

04:53.335 --> 04:56.046
We can ask my dad to bring the robo-camper.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.715
Then we could reboot it into…

04:58.799 --> 05:01.593
A robo-lemonade truck!

05:02.261 --> 05:05.097
We can put a giant papier-mâché lemon on top.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.057
And wear lemon hats.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.476
And fly signs way up high.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.270
Everyone will wanna come.

05:11.353 --> 05:17.359
Thomas, get ready to share that le-le-le-le-lemonade.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.032
Here's your lemonade, ma'am.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.617
And a cup for you.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.452
If I hadn't seen those signs in the sky,

05:27.536 --> 05:29.997
I never would've known they were sharing lemonade here.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.250
And when I saw that giant lemon on the truck and those hats,

05:33.333 --> 05:35.460
I knew I was in for something special.

05:35.544 --> 05:38.338
Emma! Doug! It's working!

05:47.764 --> 05:49.349
Wow! Bot, oh, bot!

05:49.433 --> 05:52.269
Using creativity sure drew a crowd.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.313
Did we share all the lemonade, Thomas?

05:54.396 --> 05:58.025
Not yet. Even with your ideas, there's still more to share.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.070
No problemo, Thomas.

06:03.238 --> 06:07.784
'Cause we've got a thirsty neighbor alert!

06:07.868 --> 06:14.750
Howdy! Care for a cup of our icy cold le-le-le-le-lemonade?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.418
Sorry, kids.

06:16.502 --> 06:21.006
I would, but I like to drink my beverages in the comfort and style of a café

06:21.089 --> 06:22.799
while I read my book.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.259
Thanks, though.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.637
He doesn't want any.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.516
Not yet, but he will. We've just gotta get creative.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.017
Time for another…

06:33.560 --> 06:35.062
brainstorm!

06:36.230 --> 06:37.272
I got one!

06:39.274 --> 06:41.902
Nope, never mind. Still got nothing.

06:42.778 --> 06:46.448
Hey! Since this neighbor likes to drink lemonade in a café,

06:46.532 --> 06:50.327
we can make a robo-lemonade-truck café! Look.

06:51.537 --> 06:54.164
We can have the café here, like this.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.542
Doug, you brilliant bot!

06:56.625 --> 07:00.045
We could rebuild tables where everyone can set their lemonade

07:00.128 --> 07:02.464
and put out lots of comfy chairs.

07:02.548 --> 07:04.633
-Add some bookshelves. -A menu!

07:04.716 --> 07:06.844
-And, uh-- -Hang up some pictures.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.180
And we really should have some kind of roof.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.391
Robo-roof activated.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.022
Just get this cleaned up.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.525
Done! Ready to go, Emma.

07:21.608 --> 07:26.738
The Lemonade Lounge is now open for business.

07:26.822 --> 07:30.868
Hello, folks. Welcome to our café. Isn't it creative?

07:31.451 --> 07:34.746
Wow! I've never been to a lemonade café before.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.625
How refreshing.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.837
And if you think that's something, we even deliver.

07:49.178 --> 07:50.179
Hello, sir.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.472
What's this?

07:52.556 --> 07:55.392
Why, it's The Lemonade Lounge, sir.

07:55.475 --> 08:00.647
Might I suggest today's special, icy cold lemonade?

08:01.773 --> 08:04.067
What a delightful café.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.237
And here, in my very own neighborhood.

08:07.321 --> 08:11.074
The only thing it's missing is some relaxing tunes though.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.118
Not a problem, sir.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.078
Mom, if you please.

08:17.372 --> 08:20.918
That's more like it. The lemonade, please.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.714
Scrumptious.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.466
Thanks, Mom.

08:28.926 --> 08:33.679
Well, it's official. All café customers have been served.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.518
Did we finally share all of the lemonade, Thomas?

08:38.227 --> 08:39.645
Not quite.

08:40.729 --> 08:44.107
One cup. So close!

08:44.191 --> 08:46.401
I really thought we were gonna do it.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.029
Thanks for all your creative ideas.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.448
We can't give up yet, Thomas.

08:51.532 --> 08:54.952
But we've already shared our lemonade with all of our neighbors.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.287
Not all the neighbors.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.707
Mr. Julius!

09:00.791 --> 09:04.169
But he said he didn't really like lemonade.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.631
Not sure creativity's gonna solve this one.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.008
My data banks are out of solutions.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.516
Nah.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.351
What, Thomas? Do you have an idea?

09:19.434 --> 09:22.688
I do, but I don't know. It might not work.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.857
I'm sure you guys will think of something.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.693
-But we wanna hear your idea. -Please?

09:27.776 --> 09:30.863
Hearing everyone's ideas is the best part of a…

09:32.030 --> 09:33.490
brainstorm!

09:33.574 --> 09:37.828
Well, Mr. Julius said lemonade is too sour for him,

09:37.911 --> 09:39.913
but he does like sweet oranges.

09:39.997 --> 09:43.876
Maybe we could put oranges in his lemonade so it's not sour.

09:45.377 --> 09:48.130
That's a really creative idea, Thomas.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.841
Let's, let's, let's, let's do it.

09:51.717 --> 09:55.762
Well, when life gives you lemonade, put orange slices in it, hey?

09:55.846 --> 09:58.473
I can't say no to that. Thanks, kids!

09:59.057 --> 10:01.143
Wowee! We did it!

10:02.144 --> 10:04.646
Thomas, your creative solution worked.

10:04.730 --> 10:09.109
Sensors indicate the lemonade is 100% gone!

10:09.193 --> 10:13.155
Check out Thomas sharing ideas.

10:14.990 --> 10:18.285
Well, it was thanks to you both encouraging me.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.038
I really felt like I could share my ideas.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.082
I finally learned the answer to my big question.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.711
We found creative ways for Thomas to share all of his lemonade

10:27.794 --> 10:31.089
by making sure everybody felt like they could share their ideas.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.801
Refreshing!

10:34.885 --> 10:38.305
But there are many more oranges to pick, and it's already getting late.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.724
Sure wish there was a better way to do it.

10:42.726 --> 10:43.769
I have an idea.

10:43.852 --> 10:48.398
We can use creativity to help Mr. Julius solve his orange-picking problem.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.609
And I think I know what to do.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.778
Only it might not work.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.573
There's no way to know for sure, Doug, unless you share it.

10:56.657 --> 11:00.285
Okay, here's my idea. An orange slide!

11:03.789 --> 11:05.582
Oranges coming down.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.630
Will you look at that!

11:11.713 --> 11:14.758
I've never picked so many oranges so fast in all my life.

11:14.842 --> 11:18.929
Now I just need to figure out what to do with all of them.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.305
How about…

11:20.389 --> 11:23.642
A robo orange juice truck café!

11:23.725 --> 11:25.185
Yeah!

11:33.443 --> 11:35.028
<i>It is finally here</i>

11:35.112 --> 11:36.738
<i>The best time of year</i>

11:36.822 --> 11:39.533
<i>Fall time</i>

11:39.616 --> 11:41.910
<i>When there's a chill in the air</i>

11:42.703 --> 11:45.539
<i>Pumpkin spice muffins everywhere</i>

11:45.622 --> 11:50.127
<i>It's fall time</i>

11:50.210 --> 11:53.088
<i>When Princess Woofingham rolls around</i>

11:53.172 --> 11:56.633
<i>In the fall leaves on the ground</i>

11:56.717 --> 11:59.887
<i>It's fall time</i>

12:01.305 --> 12:05.809
<i>Now it's time to celebrate With my robo-friends</i>

12:05.893 --> 12:07.728
<i>Who are great!</i>

12:07.811 --> 12:13.066
<i>'Cause it's fall time</i>

12:13.734 --> 12:17.362
Doug, my best bot, I have the greatest news.

12:17.446 --> 12:19.364
Fall has arrived!

12:19.448 --> 12:21.700
That is great. Who's Fall?

12:22.618 --> 12:25.746
Fall isn't a person. It's a season.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.623
The best season.

12:27.706 --> 12:30.375
Season? I've never heard that word either.

12:30.459 --> 12:33.086
Better plug in to find out what it means.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.756
<i>Hello, it's me, Earth</i>

12:35.839 --> 12:37.299
<i>It's a pretty great day</i>

12:37.382 --> 12:41.136
<i>Did you know my North Pole Always points the same way?</i>

12:41.220 --> 12:44.056
<i>I spin on this axis As I orbit the sun</i>

12:44.139 --> 12:47.100
<i>This makes the four seasons</i>

12:47.184 --> 12:50.646
<i>Spin, spin, spin The weather's changing</i>

12:50.729 --> 12:54.191
<i>Winter has lots of chilly short days</i>

12:54.274 --> 12:57.319
<i>Spring is warm Flowers bloom and then</i>

12:57.402 --> 13:00.822
<i>Summer heats up Thanks to warmer sun rays</i>

13:00.906 --> 13:04.576
<i>Fall starts cooling down Before we do it all again</i>

13:04.660 --> 13:07.663
<i>Spin, spin The weather is changing</i>

13:07.746 --> 13:09.581
<i>Seasons come and go</i>

13:09.665 --> 13:10.999
-<i>Whoa</i> -<i>Amazing</i>

13:11.083 --> 13:14.169
<i>Spin, spin, spin The weather is changing</i>

13:14.253 --> 13:18.632
<i>I'll keep circling the sun Making the four seasons</i>

13:20.717 --> 13:22.135
I get it.

13:22.219 --> 13:26.306
Seasons are four different times of the year where weather changes.

13:26.390 --> 13:29.852
But I still have one big question. What makes fall so special?

13:29.935 --> 13:31.895
It's your lucky day, Doug.

13:31.979 --> 13:36.608
You're gonna find out all kinds of things that make fall so special,

13:36.692 --> 13:41.572
because we're going to the Mega City Fall Festival!

13:41.655 --> 13:47.202
It's an amazing event where you can enjoy all the best activities fall has to offer,

13:47.286 --> 13:51.039
including my favorite thing to do in fall,

13:51.123 --> 13:54.543
but it's a big leaf surprise!

13:54.626 --> 13:56.587
What do you say, bots? You in?

13:56.670 --> 13:58.005
You bot I am.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.256
I'm in too!

13:59.339 --> 14:02.926
I'll meet you there right after I deliver this package.

14:03.010 --> 14:06.013
Jenny Droneberg out!

14:07.097 --> 14:08.599
We're here, bots.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.768
Welcome to Mega City Fall Festival,

14:11.852 --> 14:16.398
where you can enjoy the special things of the season.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.650
Starting with…

14:18.734 --> 14:20.152
a hayride.

14:20.235 --> 14:24.156
Well, if it isn't my favorite hay rider and her robo-friends.

14:24.239 --> 14:27.159
Hiya, Barb. We're ready for the hayride.

14:27.242 --> 14:28.911
Great, I'll start her up.

14:29.995 --> 14:32.289
Just turn the key here and…

14:32.372 --> 14:35.083
Come on. Turn it over.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.919
Well, that's not good.

14:37.002 --> 14:41.465
Sorry, folks. Afraid my truck won't be able to pull the hayride this year.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.720
Wait a nanosecond. I could pull the wagon.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.848
Moving heavy things is what I do best.

14:51.517 --> 14:53.810
-There you are. -Thanks, Mr. Forkrick.

14:53.894 --> 14:57.022
We can take the wagon to visit all the festival attractions,

14:57.105 --> 14:59.816
starting with the corn maze.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.193
Here we go.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.492
Jenny Droneberg is finally here.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.204
Let's see what this Fall Festival hoopla's all about.

15:13.664 --> 15:16.124
Wait a nanosecond, what's this?

15:16.208 --> 15:20.671
I've never seen these pointy red, yellow and orange recyclables before.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.007
And they're everywhere!

15:24.091 --> 15:26.218
The Fall Festival will have to wait.

15:26.301 --> 15:29.054
I gotta call in the drones and clean up this mess.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.181
We'll give all these pointy things a reboot.

15:33.141 --> 15:37.062
Who knew getting your sensors scrambled could be so fun!

15:37.729 --> 15:40.607
And check out what the bouncing does to your voice.

15:40.691 --> 15:45.112
Try it, Doug.

15:45.195 --> 15:48.615
You try, Critter Bot.

15:56.164 --> 16:00.043
Now arriving at our destination, the corn maze.

16:00.127 --> 16:04.214
Yes! Now shake off that hay, and let's get lost and found.

16:04.298 --> 16:10.470
Once we make it through, we'll be a step closer to a big leaf surprise!

16:11.096 --> 16:13.724
Wow! So this is a corn maze.

16:18.312 --> 16:21.523
Uh-oh, the path just ends. What do we do now, Emma?

16:21.607 --> 16:22.691
Don't worry, Doug.

16:22.774 --> 16:27.070
I can barrel through these stalks and get us out of here in no time.

16:27.154 --> 16:31.783
Wait! Mr. Forkrick, you can't just go through the corn stalks.

16:31.867 --> 16:34.620
Staying on the path is part of the fun.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.415
Hello there. Are you playing too?

16:40.250 --> 16:41.710
That's a scarecrow.

16:41.793 --> 16:44.296
He's here to keep crows away from the corn.

16:50.636 --> 16:51.970
Another scarecrow?

16:52.054 --> 16:55.057
Nope, same one. We're back where we started.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.362
The scarecrow?

17:08.444 --> 17:09.946
-Again? -Again?

17:10.030 --> 17:11.990
This is one tricky maze.

17:12.074 --> 17:16.328
Mr. Forkrick, I might need you to plow through the corn after all.

17:16.411 --> 17:17.746
On it.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.087
Critter Bot wants us to follow him.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.214
-The exit! -Way to go, Critter Bot.

17:28.298 --> 17:31.218
-We've found the exit! -We've found the exit!

17:32.594 --> 17:36.181
That was bot-tastic, Emma. What else makes fall so special?

17:36.265 --> 17:39.726
Get ready to find out at the next stop, Doug.

17:39.810 --> 17:40.853
To the pumpkins!

17:41.520 --> 17:42.729
Yeah!

17:45.524 --> 17:46.942
Keep up the good work, drones.

17:47.025 --> 17:50.988
We gotta take all these pointy things back to Rebots for recycling.

17:51.530 --> 17:52.614
What's this?

17:56.326 --> 17:58.245
Great gears!

18:05.502 --> 18:10.048
Welcome to the wonderful world of pumpkins.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.759
I've never scanned an orange orb like this before.

18:12.843 --> 18:15.012
Doug, it's a pumpkin.

18:15.095 --> 18:19.683
They're a giant fruit that you get to pick in the fall and decorate however you want.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.936
You can paint them or carve a face into the pumpkin

18:23.020 --> 18:24.938
to make a jack-o'-lantern.

18:25.022 --> 18:28.066
Just let your robo-creativity flow.

18:39.369 --> 18:44.041
Hello, I'm Penelope Pumpkin Head. Nice to meet you.

18:44.625 --> 18:45.959
What do you think, Emma?

18:46.835 --> 18:49.087
It's pumpkin perfection.

18:51.465 --> 18:53.717
Something's missing.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.680
Hello, handsome.

18:58.764 --> 19:00.557
Yay, Mr. Forkrick!

19:00.641 --> 19:03.602
You were right, Emma. Pumpkins definitely make fall special.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.020
And we're not done yet!

19:05.103 --> 19:06.980
Hold on to your hard drive, Doug,

19:07.064 --> 19:12.236
because next up is my big leaf surprise!

19:13.195 --> 19:15.239
Away to the leaves we go!

19:19.451 --> 19:22.496
Way to go, drones! That was the last of the recyclables.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.248
Roll on!

19:25.165 --> 19:29.002
Now arriving at our destination to finally see…

19:29.086 --> 19:30.629
Say it with me, everyone.

19:30.712 --> 19:33.340
The big leaf surprise!

19:35.801 --> 19:38.720
Wait, where'd all the leaves go?

19:39.388 --> 19:41.682
Uh, I'm not sure, Em.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.852
-Hi, Dad! -<i>Doug!</i>

19:44.935 --> 19:47.104
<i>We have a big problem at Rebots!</i>

19:47.187 --> 19:49.439
<i>All these little red, orange and yellow recyclables</i>

19:49.523 --> 19:50.732
<i>are clogging up the works!</i>

19:50.816 --> 19:53.527
<i>We need all bots, forks and critters on deck.</i>

19:53.610 --> 19:56.154
Red, orange and yellow?

19:56.238 --> 19:58.240
Like fall leaves!

19:59.116 --> 20:00.993
Thank bot you're here.

20:01.076 --> 20:03.787
We're having trouble rebooting all these colorful recyclables

20:03.871 --> 20:05.414
Jenny and the drones brought back.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.958
They've jammed up our tanks, tubes, booths.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.002
They're even stuck in my gears.

20:10.085 --> 20:12.129
How did they even get in there?

20:12.212 --> 20:16.466
Anyway, they've caused the whole system to shut down. We don't know what to do!

20:16.550 --> 20:19.553
Those aren't recyclables. They're fall leaves!

20:19.636 --> 20:21.972
And I know exactly what to do with them.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.099
It's robo-vacuum time, Doug!

20:27.936 --> 20:31.732
That's the highest pile of anything I've ever seen!

20:32.316 --> 20:34.109
So, what do we do with it, Emma?

20:34.193 --> 20:37.279
Only the most special thing you could do in the fall.

20:37.362 --> 20:38.906
Jump in it!

20:41.533 --> 20:42.659
Where did Emma go?

20:43.243 --> 20:46.121
What are you bots waiting for? Jump on in!

20:48.665 --> 20:50.334
Well, here goes nothing.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.465
Crunch, crunch, crunch.

21:01.470 --> 21:04.181
Hey, Emma. Why did these leaves fall on the ground?

21:04.264 --> 21:06.892
You know, Doug, I'm not sure.

21:06.975 --> 21:09.102
Maybe I could find some data.

21:09.186 --> 21:12.898
<i>In fall the leaves fall It's a pretty cool trick</i>

21:12.981 --> 21:16.401
<i>They break down in the soil Make it healthy and thick</i>

21:16.485 --> 21:23.033
<i>The clouds and sun come And bring in the rain and sunny rays</i>

21:23.116 --> 21:26.620
<i>Then the plants grow again They grow again and again</i>

21:26.703 --> 21:30.207
Wow! It's like the leaves help reboot the earth.

21:30.290 --> 21:33.085
I finally learned the answer to my big question.

21:33.168 --> 21:38.173
What makes fall so special is hayrides, corn mazes and decorating pumpkins!

21:38.257 --> 21:43.262
But I think leaves rebooting the earth is the most special thing of all.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.138
Right there with you, Doug.

21:45.222 --> 21:48.016
And don't forget jumping in the leaves!

21:50.060 --> 21:51.061
I have an idea.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.605
We can spread these leaves all around Rebots

21:53.689 --> 21:56.525
so they can reboot all of our plants in spring.

21:56.608 --> 21:58.819
That's using your processors, Doug.

21:59.403 --> 22:01.822
And let's do it in song.

22:01.905 --> 22:04.616
<i>When the leaves fall to the ground</i>

22:04.700 --> 22:07.411
<i>And we spread them all around</i>

22:07.494 --> 22:10.455
<i>It's fall time</i>

22:10.539 --> 22:13.959
<i>When the Fall Festival's in town</i>

22:14.042 --> 22:16.712
<i>And the leaves start coming down</i>

22:16.795 --> 22:19.715
<i>It's fall time</i>

22:20.549 --> 22:23.260
<i>When there's only one spot left</i>

22:24.052 --> 22:26.305
<i>But no more leaves to get</i>

22:28.932 --> 22:30.225
Hey, Critter Bot.

22:30.309 --> 22:35.272
<i>It's fall time</i>
