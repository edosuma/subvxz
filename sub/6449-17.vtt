Emil, it's been a really long day.
I'm gonna need a bigger hint than that.

Right. I was inputting
the surveillance data...

36:37.612 --> 36:40.979

had quite the romantic dinner.

I don't know
what your deﬁnition of romance is...

36:45.328 --> 36:49.822
...but mine is not facing the threat
of having my neck snapped in two.

You looked tempted to me. By him.

37:47.014 --> 37:48.675
Yeah, it's just a jacket.

37:48.849 --> 37:53.013
Kind of, but everything around here
has memories attached to the place.

37:53.854 --> 37:56.766
I don't need things to remind me
of what I've had here.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.689
Clark, it seems like...

that really shock you up.
