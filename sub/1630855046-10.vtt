00:30.155 --> 00:32.240
The female and the male are unwell.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.992
The male fed me once.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.454
I hope he feeds me again.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.998
The female scared my uncle at her home.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.625
Scared? Did he release poo-poo?

00:42.625 --> 00:45.211
Yes, he released.
She pointed a weapon at him.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.297
Can this act of war be verified?

00:47.297 --> 00:49.174
I will cry out for testimony.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.271
It is confirmed.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.398
I am upset.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.336
Fuck.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.113
Stay right where you are.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.030
Amy.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.740
Put the gun down.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.117
Don't move.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.494
I'm calling the police.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.084
What the fuck? Get away from me!

02:09.838 --> 02:11.089
Danny!

02:25.603 --> 02:26.563
Shit.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.190
Danny!

03:21.451 --> 03:22.911
Shit.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.836
Fuck. Why'd you make me do that?!

03:46.184 --> 03:47.644
Help!

04:06.454 --> 04:07.997
Help!

04:12.627 --> 04:13.544
Shit.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.065
Fuck.

04:53.001 --> 04:53.960
Fuck.

04:54.711 --> 04:55.753
Ow.

05:14.897 --> 05:15.982
Shit.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.228
Goddamn it.

05:57.607 --> 05:58.566
Water.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.911
Oh, someone's here. Thank God.

06:09.911 --> 06:10.953
Hello?

06:15.041 --> 06:17.085
Ugh! Danny!

06:17.085 --> 06:19.087
Oh, fuck you!

06:19.087 --> 06:20.254
Leave me alone!

06:20.254 --> 06:22.131
You leave me alone!

06:22.131 --> 06:24.342
You ruined my life!

06:24.342 --> 06:27.470
I ruined your life? What?

06:27.470 --> 06:31.265
I may never see June again,
you psycho!

06:32.100 --> 06:35.144
My brother is dead because of you!

06:35.812 --> 06:36.646
What?

06:38.815 --> 06:39.649
Ow.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.569
Paul's dead?

06:44.779 --> 06:46.280
I don't know. I think so.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.281
Fuck!

06:47.281 --> 06:48.699
Danny, what happened?

06:49.242 --> 06:50.451
The cops shot him.

06:51.577 --> 06:54.288
He tried to climb over the wall
and they fucking shot him.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.624
Well, did you see him
get into an ambulance?

06:56.624 --> 06:59.794
- How many times did he get shot?
- I don't know, okay?

07:00.670 --> 07:01.879
I couldn't see.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.506
Well, then you don't know.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.967
Like, maybe he got away.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.802
I mean, that could happen, right?

07:07.802 --> 07:09.428
I don't know. I'm lost.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.556
I just gotta see if he's okay.

07:12.306 --> 07:15.226
All right? I just--
Do you know how to get back?

07:15.893 --> 07:20.356
Look, I hurt my ankle
when you shoved me down the fucking hill,

07:21.107 --> 07:25.069
so just help me get out of here
and I'll show you where the road is.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.529
I won't call the cops.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.365
Where's your gun?

07:30.283 --> 07:31.909
I don't know. I lost it.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.745
How do I know you're not hiding it?

07:34.745 --> 07:37.165
Huh? Because you're a pathological liar.

07:37.165 --> 07:40.751
Because I would be shooting you with it,
you moron.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.839
Hey! Hey, come back here.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.674
No. Use nice words!

07:46.674 --> 07:48.468
You called me a liar.

07:48.468 --> 07:52.096
I am not helping you
unless you use nice words!

07:52.805 --> 07:54.765
All right, all right, all right.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.353
There's a hospital by the highway exit.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.147
I bet they took him there.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.858
Look, you don't get to talk about Paul.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.486
- All right?
- I was just trying to help.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.531
If I'm gonna carry you,
you don't get to talk, period.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.408
Whatever.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.584
God, there is no service anywhere.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.212
What am I going to do?

08:24.212 --> 08:28.132
- If he thinks he can just take her away--
- Can you please shut the fuck up?

08:28.132 --> 08:30.259
Okay? You sure we're going the right way?

08:30.259 --> 08:33.471
Yes, I know where I'm going.
Head towards those trees.

08:33.471 --> 08:37.099
Which trees? They're all trees.
- The ones I'm pointing to, dumbass.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.351
Oh, my God.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.401
- It feels like we're going in circles.
- Well, we're not, okay?

08:47.401 --> 08:48.486
Okay.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.365
Do you have anything to eat?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.284
Yeah. Hold on.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.289
Oh.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.000
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.126
- Thanks--
- Here you go.

09:05.086 --> 09:08.381
- You are such a dick.
- Mm. That is so good.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.383
Ow! Why'd you do that?

09:11.384 --> 09:13.386
You started it.
God.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.606
What are you doing?

09:26.148 --> 09:27.441
Stop. Stop. Stop.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.120
Your brother taught me that move.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.037
Fuck you.

09:40.037 --> 09:43.332
Next time someone honks at you,
maybe let it go.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.418
Maybe next time,
think twice before you honk.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.712
- How about that?
- Why are you angry all the time?

09:47.712 --> 09:50.590
- I could ask you the same thing.
- Whatever.

09:51.215 --> 09:52.133
We need water.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.219
Humans can go days
without water, so relax.

09:55.219 --> 09:57.263
That is 100 percent not true.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.598
Oh, yeah? How long then?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.850
I don't know-- Nineteen hours?

10:00.850 --> 10:04.103
Nineteen? I've slept nineteen hours
without water, you idiot.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.272
Who sleeps that long?

10:06.272 --> 10:07.815
I had a bad day!

10:07.815 --> 10:09.775
- You're a child.
- You're a baby.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.694
You can't even walk.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.989
And you fucked yourself, by the way.
I can't even carry you now.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.282
It doesn't matter.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.784
I just need to last through the night.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.245
- Someone's gonna find me in the morning.
- Right.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.706
You think someone's looking for you?

10:23.706 --> 10:25.833
I bet George doesn't
even know you're missing.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.919
He's not gonna check on you,
after all you put him through.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.050
Please, you're not gonna shoot me.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.928
Relax! Jesus! My God.

10:37.928 --> 10:41.057
You are fucking proof that Western therapy
does not work on Eastern minds.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.808
Yeah, no shit.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.561
Now go find some aloe vera and agave.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.355
Elderberries too.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.356
Come on.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.483
Fine.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.736
And stay where I can see you
because I will shoot.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.655
I have nothing left to lose.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.367
What the fuck is an elderberry?

11:03.996 --> 11:05.498
Can I eat this?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.416
No, those are flowers.

11:08.209 --> 11:11.337
Go towards the rock.
Juicy shit thrives in the shade.

11:13.547 --> 11:14.840
Can I eat this?

11:14.840 --> 11:18.260
God, just listen to me
and look for what I said.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.769
Can I get you anything else?

11:26.769 --> 11:28.854
Tea? Dessert?

11:29.939 --> 11:32.066
Keep sassing and you won't get any.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.528
Oh, wow, okay.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.574
You know what your problem is?

11:41.575 --> 11:43.494
You only think about yourself.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.998
Your problem is
you only bitch about everybody else.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.129
Let's just stop talking, okay?

11:56.298 --> 11:58.509
Here, have some elderberries.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.094
Come on.

12:03.472 --> 12:04.515
Whatever.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.184
What a fucking mess.

12:07.726 --> 12:10.187
You know, you're born,

12:11.063 --> 12:12.398
you make choices,

12:13.899 --> 12:15.151
then suddenly...

12:16.318 --> 12:17.319
you're here.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.030
Great summary.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.743
Hey, are you sure these are elderberry?

12:28.706 --> 12:29.915
Oh, my God.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.169
What the fuck did we eat?

12:34.795 --> 12:36.046
Something poisonous.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.175
I thought you were a plant expert?

12:39.175 --> 12:41.469
I just Google shit and pretend I am.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.597
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.276
I think we're in trouble. This--

12:57.985 --> 12:59.403
This is not normal.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.324
I'll go find help.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.368
No, you won't be able to make it back.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.120
I just want to try.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.205
Hey!

13:09.872 --> 13:11.499
Don't leave me here.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.387
I can't move.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.432
What's happening?

13:28.432 --> 13:30.184
- What?
- What?

13:31.227 --> 13:33.103
What even is poison?

13:33.103 --> 13:34.939
I think they're just chemicals.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.941
What are chemicals?

13:36.941 --> 13:38.526
I don't know, Danny.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.613
How come Asians
are all lactose intolerant?

13:42.613 --> 13:43.614
Um...

13:44.365 --> 13:45.407
Maybe because, uh...

13:47.660 --> 13:50.246
milk wasn't part of our ancestors' diet.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.165
No, that doesn't make sense,

13:53.165 --> 13:55.751
because all Korean dishes have beef.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.337
So if we have the cows,
why wouldn't we drink the milk?

13:58.337 --> 13:59.672
- Hey...
- You know?

13:59.672 --> 14:02.299
...you gotta stop
asking me questions, okay?

14:02.967 --> 14:05.928
- You sound like June.
<i>Mommy, why do you work so much?</i>

14:05.928 --> 14:09.598
- Okay. You all right?
<i>Mommy, don't leave me!</i>

14:09.598 --> 14:11.767
Time is not making sense right now.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.520
George told me how time is like--

14:15.312 --> 14:18.983
Like, when you're a kid,
it's all... small.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.152
There's like a percentage--

14:22.152 --> 14:23.988
Fuck. I'm messing it up.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.074
Um, there's-- Fuck!

14:27.074 --> 14:28.868
Fuck, I mess everything up.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.370
I have to go home.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.038
The day you honked at me,

14:33.038 --> 14:34.999
I was trying to return
these hibachi grills

14:34.999 --> 14:37.042
that I bought to kill myself.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.753
Oh.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.006
They wouldn't let me return them.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.010
It's like the world wanted me gone.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.972
Maybe that's why we're sick--

14:58.606 --> 15:00.065
<i>God, I fucked it all up,</i>

15:00.065 --> 15:02.568
<i>they never even got
my college applications.</i>

15:02.568 --> 15:04.236
<i>Help Paul out.</i>

15:04.236 --> 15:06.405
<i>You're the older brother after all.</i>

15:09.992 --> 15:11.619
You hear those voices?

15:12.411 --> 15:14.496
No, I don't hear anything.

15:14.496 --> 15:15.998
That's nice.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.168
Danny, you really need to throw up.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.753
It helped me feel better.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.006
One time I peed
all over someone's bathroom.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.091
Yeah, that was me.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.843
Oh, yeah, right.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.846
No, I was thinking when I was a kid.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.642
It was an accident,
but my dad smacked the shit out of me.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.977
Now you have to pass that trauma down

15:36.977 --> 15:40.689
to an innocent driver of a white SUV.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.403
You know our body absorbs nutrients,

15:47.071 --> 15:49.865
and then pisses and shits out
all the bad stuff?

15:49.865 --> 15:51.659
Yeah, Danny, I do know about that.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.161
What if we're doing that to babies?

15:54.703 --> 15:56.789
But, you know, like parents,

15:56.789 --> 15:59.875
like they just, like,
piss their trauma down.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.795
I wonder who took the first piss.
You know?

16:02.795 --> 16:05.881
- What were we before monkeys?
- Sponge.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.968
We weren't sponge before monkey.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.220
We used to have tails.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.931
Sometimes I can still feel
where my tail used to be--

16:17.434 --> 16:19.395
Oh, my God, someone's coming.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.773
Thank you.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.859
Thank you so much.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.570
For what?

16:31.407 --> 16:32.574
What?

16:35.536 --> 16:36.704
Oh.

16:36.704 --> 16:37.997
I think that helped.

16:39.206 --> 16:42.084
Oh, look, it's pretty like Skittles.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.962
I could go
for some Burger King right now.

16:45.713 --> 16:49.550
You know, everyone born
in the '80s got fucking screwed,

16:49.550 --> 16:53.512
like, fast food, candy,
fucking secondhand smoke.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.599
Look, just think about it.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.729
We hit puberty
right when they invented the Internet.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.232
And then when we left home,
that's when ethernet became a thing.

17:06.025 --> 17:06.900
Right.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.695
All that porn. Uncharted territory.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.739
Yeah, it was like Wild, Wild West shit.

17:11.739 --> 17:14.783
I didn't even have to search.
I grabbed whatever was available.

17:14.783 --> 17:18.245
You know what,
we were the guinea pigs, right?

17:18.245 --> 17:19.413
We got used.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.373
It's fucked up.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.417
I guess I can agree with that.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.502
Yo, what if--

17:27.588 --> 17:33.427
What if our generation
started copying the porn

17:33.427 --> 17:35.429
that they saw in real life?

17:35.429 --> 17:38.390
And then real life became the porn.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.685
Like digital--
Like a digital-analog bridge.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.353
Oh, whoa.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.356
Right, like...

17:48.067 --> 17:50.611
we're the reason
choking is mainstream now.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.154
It is?

17:52.821 --> 17:56.492
Yeah, all the kids are doing it.

17:58.118 --> 18:00.454
They don't even know
that it used to be less common.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.371
What?

18:04.291 --> 18:06.126
Is that what my brother was like?

18:06.126 --> 18:08.962
Yeah, very rough
but like in the best way possible.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.632
Okay, actually never--
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Okay?

18:11.632 --> 18:14.551
I'm sorry I asked.
I don't want to know details.

18:15.969 --> 18:16.929
Sorry.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.228
I don't even know
if Paul had a real girlfriend.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.149
I should have talked to him more.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.111
About some real shit.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.072
He would have liked that.

18:37.866 --> 18:40.035
I think he just wanted to feel seen.

18:40.869 --> 18:44.081
I mean, we all do, right?

18:46.834 --> 18:49.378
I don't want anyone
to see who I really am.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.970
You know, one time
I was so sick of George's vases,

18:58.929 --> 19:02.432
I broke one on purpose
and I blamed it on June.

19:02.432 --> 19:05.352
- You don't like George's vases?
- No, I hate them.

19:08.188 --> 19:11.066
I just-- I couldn't tell him.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.569
I couldn't tell him a lot of things.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.862
Why not?

19:14.862 --> 19:18.949
I think when nowhere feels like home,
you just retreat into yourself.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.957
But George and June feel like home, right?

19:31.044 --> 19:32.045
I don't know.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.759
I used to think June was the answer.

19:37.759 --> 19:40.846
When she was a baby,
I'd look at her and I just felt like,

19:41.471 --> 19:44.016
no matter what I did
or didn't do that day,

19:44.641 --> 19:46.435
her love would never waver.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.897
And I've been chasing
that feeling with her ever since.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.775
But she's getting older.

19:55.402 --> 19:58.280
And her love gets very conditional.

19:58.280 --> 20:02.451
Right, like if you give me that cookie,
then I'll give you the hug.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.287
Paul is like that.

20:05.787 --> 20:06.705
Still is.

20:06.705 --> 20:07.956
Exactly.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.293
I realized, you know, when she was a baby,

20:12.211 --> 20:14.588
she never had unconditional love for me.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.843
People think babies are so innocent
and cute but they're not.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.595
No, they're all screaming and crying

20:21.595 --> 20:23.889
because they don't got
what they want right away.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.809
- Ugh.
- They're the most ruthless of us all.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.520
They just lack the words or power
to do anything about it.

20:31.188 --> 20:34.983
A baby with mobility and strength
is just a serial killer.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.446
And yet, to think...

20:40.739 --> 20:43.825
I expected this little child
to make me whole.

20:45.827 --> 20:49.539
When George couldn't and work couldn't.

20:52.960 --> 20:53.961
Hmm.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.799
Why is it so hard for us to be happy?

21:05.555 --> 21:07.516
Oh, shit, you okay?

21:08.141 --> 21:09.351
Did I eat Skittles?

21:12.521 --> 21:16.066
Oh, something's not right.
It's coming back on strong.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.277
I feel like you're inside my head.

21:19.027 --> 21:20.737
Are you talking or me?

21:20.737 --> 21:22.072
I'm not sure.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.950
I think I was talking
about this one night,

21:25.534 --> 21:27.202
I was up real late at night

21:27.202 --> 21:30.414
and my mom got me real good
with that Kmart <i>maemae.</i>

21:31.248 --> 21:33.792
I think I was like 12 or 13 at the time.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.712
I got out of bed
and walked over to my brother's.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.631
God, he must have been having
a good-ass dream

21:39.631 --> 21:41.550
because he was all smiling and shit.

21:42.884 --> 21:45.137
Made me so fucking mad.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.641
I grabbed a mechanical pencil
and I was about to stab Paul in the eye.

21:51.518 --> 21:55.188
And the only reason I didn't
was because when I looked up

21:56.231 --> 21:59.484
there was a motel guest staring
right back at me outside the window.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.445
I thought I did that.

22:02.946 --> 22:03.780
Wait.

22:05.657 --> 22:06.950
Who am I?

22:06.950 --> 22:09.786
Yo, you're Amy.

22:09.786 --> 22:11.330
I'm Danny. Come on.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.623
Oh, right, I'm Amy.

22:15.459 --> 22:19.588
Wait, did you jerk off to my butt photo?

22:20.756 --> 22:21.757
I'm sorry.

22:22.382 --> 22:23.884
It's okay, Danny.

22:27.929 --> 22:30.265
I've done some shameful things too.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.560
Yo, by the way,
what's up with your tattoo?

22:33.560 --> 22:35.145
It's the number 22.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.397
Right, but why 22?

22:37.939 --> 22:41.193
Did you know Joseph Heller
titled his book <i>Catch-18</i>

22:41.193 --> 22:45.572
but his editor arbitrarily changed it
to <i>Catch-22?</i>

22:47.532 --> 22:48.909
Ow, ow, ow.

22:49.618 --> 22:50.660
No.

22:50.660 --> 22:55.832
Well, for as long as I can remember,
that's what being alive has felt like.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.002
Can't have form without space.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.798
Can't experience light without dark.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.800
We're stuck.

23:05.634 --> 23:09.763
Yeah, and any time you try
to hold on to one thing...

23:13.558 --> 23:15.060
it slips away.

23:18.021 --> 23:21.441
I've never been able
to describe this feeling inside of me,

23:23.151 --> 23:24.528
but I think that's it.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.948
Catch-22.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.660
Right? It's like a void.

23:32.452 --> 23:38.291
But not. It's like empty but solid.

23:38.291 --> 23:41.336
Yes, that's right, Daniel.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.463
Empty but solid.

23:45.298 --> 23:47.050
Right under the surface.

23:49.052 --> 23:51.138
You think other people feel this way?

23:54.141 --> 23:55.642
I know George doesn't.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.271
I hope June never does.

24:00.981 --> 24:01.898
I don't know.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.484
Maybe we're not normal.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.362
Maybe we're too fucked up.

24:08.864 --> 24:14.452
Or maybe normal people
are just delusional fucked up people.

24:17.289 --> 24:22.085
Either way,
that's why I don't believe in God.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.421
What do you mean?

24:26.798 --> 24:29.009
Why would a God make it like this?

24:32.429 --> 24:35.974
Well, if God is everything,

24:37.559 --> 24:38.560
then we're God.

24:39.686 --> 24:41.688
That means God is just like us.

24:42.731 --> 24:45.650
Maybe that's why
everything is the way it is.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.904
God's just trying not to feel alone
in nothingness.

24:51.239 --> 24:54.159
I've never talked to anybody
like this before.

24:55.118 --> 24:56.244
Me neither.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.500
I think we're dying.

25:04.544 --> 25:05.921
I think so too.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.054
I see your life.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.391
You poor thing.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.398
All you wanted was to not be alone.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.318
You don't have to be ashamed.

25:29.736 --> 25:30.820
It's okay.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.116
I see it all.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.244
You don't have to hide. It's okay.

25:42.624 --> 25:43.583
Wow.

25:47.087 --> 25:49.130
There's really nothing after this.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.802
We should have done this more often.

25:56.638 --> 25:57.889
What a waste.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.978
At least we did it once.

26:05.563 --> 26:06.564
Yeah.

26:08.149 --> 26:09.359
This is nice.

26:48.690 --> 26:49.774
Oh, my God.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.193
Danny, wake up.

26:54.529 --> 26:55.363
Huh?

27:02.871 --> 27:03.997
We're still here?

27:03.997 --> 27:04.956
Yeah.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.430
Hey, I hear cars.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.599
Oh, we gotta be getting close.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.685
It's kind of funny
that we're rushing back

27:25.685 --> 27:28.063
to the absolute shit show
that's waiting for us.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.565
Yeah, well...

27:30.565 --> 27:32.567
we gotta face it, right? Fuck.

27:32.567 --> 27:35.070
Yeah, but we could slow down, right?

27:36.863 --> 27:39.574
Yeah. All right, yeah.

27:42.410 --> 27:43.453
You know what?

27:43.453 --> 27:46.331
You forget, but LA's pretty beautiful.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.332
Oh, yeah.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.793
You get so used to it,
it's easy to take for granted.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.628
Oh, shit.

27:51.628 --> 27:53.546
There's some houses over there.

27:53.546 --> 27:54.714
Oh, wow.

27:54.714 --> 27:56.216
Look. There they are.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.675
It's so peaceful from up here.

28:02.764 --> 28:03.723
I got reception.

28:10.063 --> 28:12.107
Oh. Thank you, God.

28:13.358 --> 28:14.442
Paul's alive.

28:14.442 --> 28:16.861
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.781
Shit, I lost reception.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.658
Fuck. Me too.

28:27.705 --> 28:30.333
Those houses looked a lot closer
from up there.

28:30.333 --> 28:31.251
Oh, shit.

28:31.251 --> 28:32.544
I think we're close.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.837
Oh, thank God.

28:36.589 --> 28:38.675
I'm sure we can explain everything.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.010
A good lawyer should keep you out of jail.

28:41.010 --> 28:43.138
Look, Danny,
if you need help with anything,

28:43.138 --> 28:45.682
- like financially or like--
- No, no, no. I'll be fine.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.309
Everything's gonna work out as it should.

28:48.309 --> 28:49.477
Are you sure?

28:49.936 --> 28:52.313
I mean, I'm not, but...

28:53.815 --> 28:56.192
- We need a break.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:56.192 --> 28:57.152
Okay.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.529
- All right, you good?
- Yep.

28:59.529 --> 29:01.364
Careful, careful. Okay?

29:01.364 --> 29:02.824
- Yeah.
Hey!

29:03.616 --> 29:06.536
- Amy! Are you okay?
- George?

29:07.662 --> 29:09.247
Get your hands off her!

29:47.744 --> 29:49.454
