WEBVTT

00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:07.125 --> 00:10.834
I AM 407 DAYS SOBER.

00:10.875 --> 00:13.041
I DEBATED WHETHER OR NOT
I SHOULD SAY THE EXACT NUMBER

00:13.083 --> 00:14.917
OR JUST ROUGH IT,
BUT I FIGURED,

00:14.959 --> 00:17.583
I'VE EARNED EVERY DAY SO...

00:17.625 --> 00:20.375
MY FRIEND CHARLOTTE
WAS 8 WEEKS PREGNANT

00:20.417 --> 00:22.417
WHEN I CELEBRATED A YEAR.

00:22.458 --> 00:23.959
I USE HER TO KEEP TRACK.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.959
IF SHE WERE HERE,
SHE WOULD PROBABLY SAY,

00:26.000 --> 00:27.333
"GLAD SOMEBODY'S GETTING
SOMETHING USEFUL

00:27.375 --> 00:28.875
OUT OF THIS PREGNANCY."

00:28.917 --> 00:32.875
S-SOUNDS LESS AWFUL
IF YOU KNOW HER.

00:32.917 --> 00:36.125
I'M DOING OKAY
IN MY SECOND YEAR.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.041
I GOT
THIS GREAT NEW APARTMENT.

00:38.083 --> 00:39.625
BEEN THERE A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

00:39.667 --> 00:41.667
I'M REALLY TRYING
TO MAKE IT A HOME.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.417
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN,

00:44.458 --> 00:46.834
BUT I'M ADJUSTING.

00:46.875 --> 00:48.041
(sniffs) EW.

00:48.083 --> 00:50.667
IT'S NICE TO HAVE
MY OWN KITCHEN,

00:50.709 --> 00:52.667
BE ABLE TO COOK
WHATEVER I WANT.

00:52.709 --> 00:54.041
(crunches)

00:54.083 --> 00:57.166
AND I STARTED
WORKING OUT AGAIN,

00:57.208 --> 01:00.458
WHICH IS GOOD,
YOU KNOW...

01:00.500 --> 01:02.625
AND HEALTHY.

01:02.667 --> 01:06.083
YEAR TWO IS A CHALLENGE,

01:06.125 --> 01:08.291
BUT I'M READY.

01:08.333 --> 01:09.917
AND IT'S ALL ABOUT GROWTH,

01:09.959 --> 01:13.041
AND I'VE SET MYSELF UP
TO GROW.

01:13.083 --> 01:16.917
I'M GOOD.

01:16.959 --> 01:19.250
I'M REALLY GOOD.

01:19.291 --> 01:29.709
(applause)

01:29.750 --> 01:31.083
(camera shutter clicks)

01:33.333 --> 01:34.959
HOLLA.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.667
"HOLLA"?
GOOD WEEKEND?

01:36.709 --> 01:39.125
DIDN'T LEAVE MY APARTMENT.
UNPACKED.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.083
YOU'VE BEEN THERE
THREE MONTHS.

01:41.125 --> 01:42.291
I'M METHODICAL.

01:42.333 --> 01:43.500
YOU SHOULD BE OUT THERE,

01:43.542 --> 01:45.083
DOING THINGS
THAT MAKE ME FEEL OLD.

01:45.125 --> 01:47.041
SHE DID GREET US
WITH A HOLLA.

01:47.083 --> 01:48.125
THANK YOU, COOP.

01:48.166 --> 01:50.041
HAVE YOU MET
ANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS?

01:50.083 --> 01:52.041
I'M FOCUSED ON MY RECOVERY.

01:52.083 --> 01:53.250
WELL, SOCIALIZATION

01:53.291 --> 01:55.041
IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF YOUR RECOVERY.

01:55.083 --> 01:56.125
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED DATING?

01:56.166 --> 01:58.458
SO I CAN SEE HOW QUICKLY
I MAKE DUDES MY AGE

01:58.500 --> 02:00.166
SPRINT
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION?

02:00.208 --> 02:01.917
AW.
OH, COME ON.
WE'RE ALL DOCTORS.

02:01.959 --> 02:04.041
WE'RE DOCTORS WITH FRIENDS
WHO DON'T SCARE EASILY.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.291
MM-HMM.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.041
WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO DATING
SOMEONE WE ALL VETTED?

02:07.083 --> 02:08.792
IF I SAY NO,
IT'LL BE A THING, RIGHT?

02:08.834 --> 02:10.041
YES.
OH, YEAH. YES.

02:10.083 --> 02:11.083
FINE.

02:11.125 --> 02:14.291
JUST DON'T
MAKE ME REGRET IT.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.041
IT WAS GREAT, RIGHT?

02:16.083 --> 02:17.125
DON'T ANSWER.

02:17.166 --> 02:19.458
I ALREADY KNOW. (laughs)

02:19.500 --> 02:21.291
DID YOU LIKE YOUR STEAK?

02:21.333 --> 02:22.667
YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW?

02:22.709 --> 02:24.041
(laughs)

02:24.083 --> 02:25.250
SO YOU LIKED IT?

02:25.291 --> 02:27.917
ALMOST AS MUCH
AS YOU ORDERING IT FOR ME.

02:27.959 --> 02:29.750
WAS THAT SARCASM?

02:29.792 --> 02:32.041
YOU'D TELL ME
IF THAT WAS SARCASM, RIGHT?

02:32.083 --> 02:33.500
THANKS.

02:33.542 --> 02:36.041
COULD WE SPLIT THIS,
PLEASE?

02:36.083 --> 02:37.375
YEAH.

02:37.417 --> 02:39.000
YOU'RE REALLY INTERESTED
IN THIS?

02:39.041 --> 02:40.500
YOU CUT
INTO PEOPLE'S BRAINS.

02:40.542 --> 02:41.709
IF THAT'S NOT INTERESTING,

02:41.750 --> 02:43.500
THEN WHAT'S THE HOPE
FOR THE REST OF US?

02:43.542 --> 02:44.709
(chuckles)

02:44.750 --> 02:46.625
(cell phone buzzes)

02:46.667 --> 02:48.917
SOMETHING WRONG?

02:48.959 --> 02:50.834
NAH. (chuckles)

02:50.875 --> 02:53.208
(buzz)

02:53.250 --> 02:55.041
ARE YOU SURE?

02:55.083 --> 02:56.041
YEAH.

02:56.083 --> 02:58.041
SHE JUST THINKS
WHEN SHE SAYS "JUMP,"

02:58.083 --> 02:59.959
I SHOULD SAY, "HOW HIGH?"

03:00.000 --> 03:01.041
SHE?

03:01.083 --> 03:03.041
MY EX-WIFE.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.125
(buzz)

03:07.083 --> 03:08.583
YOU KNOW, IT WAS PERFECT,

03:08.625 --> 03:10.667
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IT WASN'T.

03:10.709 --> 03:12.875
SHE DOESN'T THINK
I DESERVE AN EXPLANATION.

03:12.917 --> 03:16.333
BUT... SHE STILL TELLS ME
SHE LOVES ME WHEN SHE DRINKS.

03:16.375 --> 03:17.875
(mouths word)

03:17.917 --> 03:19.458
I'M GONNA CRY.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.500
(crying)

03:24.875 --> 03:26.041
(clicks tongue)

03:26.083 --> 03:27.834
AHH. (blows air)

03:27.875 --> 03:29.542
(indistinct conversations)

03:29.583 --> 03:30.959
UH...

03:31.000 --> 03:34.041
MM.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.041
(inhales)

03:36.083 --> 03:37.667
(exhales)

03:37.709 --> 03:39.667
UH...

03:39.709 --> 03:41.667
SHOULD WE SPLIT THE CHECK?
WE SHOULD SPLIT THE CHECK,
YEAH.

03:41.709 --> 03:43.041
(laughter)

03:43.083 --> 03:44.500
I MEAN, ARE--WERE YOU GUYS
ALSO PART OF THE TEAM

03:44.542 --> 03:45.917
THAT VETTED SARAH PALIN?

03:45.959 --> 03:47.041
(Violet) I'M SO SORRY.

03:47.083 --> 03:48.500
I THOUGHT GEORGE
WAS OVER HER.

03:48.542 --> 03:52.375
AND I THOUGHT MARSHALL WAS
A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED TEXAS BOY.

03:52.417 --> 03:53.583
WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

03:53.625 --> 03:55.000
(Addison)
AMELIA'S AWFUL DATES.

03:55.041 --> 03:56.083
OH, YOU'RE DATING.
OH, THAT--THAT'S GOOD.

03:56.125 --> 03:58.041
YEAH, NO. THAT'S OVER.

03:58.083 --> 04:00.333
OH, COME ON. BAD DATES ARE
KIND OF A NECESSARY EVIL.

04:00.375 --> 04:02.041
I DATED A POET ONCE.

04:02.083 --> 04:03.667
HE WAS A REALLY,
REALLY BAD POET. (laughs)

04:03.709 --> 04:06.041
TURNS OUT THE ODDS OF
FINDING A-A POE OR A FROST

04:06.083 --> 04:08.709
ARE LIKE
A MILLION TO ONE.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.500
DATING EDGAR ALLAN POE
WOULD PROBABLY BE A DRAG.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.709
(laughs)

04:11.750 --> 04:13.041
I MEAN, IF I HAD TO IMAGINE.

04:13.083 --> 04:14.208
I MEAN, FINDING SOMEONE
SHOULDN'T FEEL LIKE A JOB.

04:14.250 --> 04:15.750
MY PARENTS MET AT A DANCE.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.458
THEY BOTH WALKED IN,
SAW EACH OTHER ACROSS THE ROOM,

04:17.500 --> 04:18.875
THAT WAS IT.

04:18.917 --> 04:20.291
YEAH, BUT THAT WAS
A DIFFERENT TIME.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.709
OKAY, MISS "I MET MY GUY
AT THE GROCERY."

04:22.750 --> 04:24.083
(Charlotte) OH,
I WENT OUT WITH A GUY

04:24.125 --> 04:26.125
WHO SAID HE KNEW
THE BEST BRUNCH SPOT IN L.A.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.834
WELL, HE WASN'T LYING.

04:27.875 --> 04:30.291
THE RUB WAS, IT WAS
BEING SERVED BY HIS CULT.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.083
(Addison, Violet, and Amelia)
OHH.

04:32.125 --> 04:33.291
I'LL DO YOU ONE BETTER.

04:33.333 --> 04:34.500
IMAGINE YOU'RE HAVING
A LOVELY TIME,

04:34.542 --> 04:35.709
AND THEN
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT,

04:35.750 --> 04:37.834
YOUR DATE IS ENGAGED
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.041
OH.

04:39.083 --> 04:40.834
I NEVER THANKED YOU
FOR THAT DINNER.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.041
YOU'RE WELCOME.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.208
OKAY, ALL OF THIS IS JUST
MAKING MY COUCH

04:43.250 --> 04:45.041
SEEM THAT MUCH MORE
APPEALING.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.500
WHO ARE YOU GONNA MEET
ON YOUR COUCH?

04:46.542 --> 04:48.166
OH, I MET COOPER
ON MY COUCH.

04:48.208 --> 04:49.375
OR WAS I IN BED?

04:49.417 --> 04:51.041
UH, YOU MET COOPER
ON A SEX SITE.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.041
I MEAN, IT WAS PROBABLY
THE BEDROOM, I WOULD GUESS.

04:53.083 --> 04:55.041
I'M NOT TROLLING THE INTERNET
FOR DATES.

04:55.083 --> 04:59.083
I'VE SEEN WHAT'S OUT THERE.
ALONE IS BETTER.

05:00.792 --> 05:02.750
I GUESS MY AGENT
CAN SUBMIT ME

05:02.792 --> 05:04.458
FOR BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN
NOW.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.834
I GET THAT SHE'S A MONSTER.

05:05.875 --> 05:07.250
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT
SHE WAS TOO GOOD FOR HIM.

05:07.291 --> 05:08.458
(chuckles)

05:08.500 --> 05:10.375
(instruments clatter)

05:10.417 --> 05:12.041
BEEN IN ANYTHING
I MAY HAVE SEEN?

05:12.083 --> 05:14.166
HMM. EVER BEEN TO
THE LINDEN BOULEVARD CHURCH

05:14.208 --> 05:15.709
IN ALBUQUERQUE?

05:15.750 --> 05:17.041
CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.291
(chuckles) I KNOW
I'M STARTING OUT HERE

05:18.333 --> 05:19.709
ABOUT TEN YEARS TOO LATE,

05:19.750 --> 05:22.542
BUT THIS IS THE ONLY THING
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.917
AND I JUST KEEP
COMING BACK TO IT.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.083
(gloves snap)

05:26.125 --> 05:28.291
AFTER COLLEGE, I HAD LOANS,
AND MY MOM GOT SICK.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.500
I STAYED WITH HER
TILL SHE PASSED.

05:30.542 --> 05:33.417
SIX MONTHS AGO,
I DECIDED TO GET IN THE CAR

05:33.458 --> 05:35.208
AND JUST DRIVE.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.583
DOESN'T WORK OUT,
AT LEAST I TRIED.

05:37.625 --> 05:40.166
AND I GOT TO SMELL THE OCEAN
EVERY MORNING ALONG THE WAY.

05:40.208 --> 05:42.000
NOT SO BAD, RIGHT?

05:42.041 --> 05:44.000
YOU PAGED ME, DR. PETERSON?

05:44.041 --> 05:46.208
SHE REFUSES
TO CALL ME JAMES.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.166
THIS IS KAYE,
NEW ONSET SEIZURE.

05:48.208 --> 05:51.375
I WAS AT AN AUDITION--
MY FIRST REAL AUDITION--

05:51.417 --> 05:53.917
AND THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER
IS HEARING MY NAME.

05:53.959 --> 05:55.959
I'M NOT HOLDING MY BREATH
FOR A CALLBACK.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.041
(chuckles)

05:57.083 --> 05:58.333
PRESENTED WITH A CLASSIC
TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE.

05:58.375 --> 05:59.667
I STABILIZED HER WITH
10 MILLIGRAMS OF LORAZEPAM.

05:59.709 --> 06:02.041
SMALL LAC SECONDARY
TO THE FALL.

06:02.083 --> 06:04.250
ORDERED TESTS
ON THE USUAL SUSPECTS.

06:04.291 --> 06:05.875
ANY PREVIOUS HISTORY
OF SEIZURES?

06:05.917 --> 06:07.333
RECENT HEADACHES,

06:07.375 --> 06:09.250
DIZZINESS,
VISUAL CHANGES,

06:09.291 --> 06:10.542
NUMBNESS, OR WEAKNESS?

06:10.583 --> 06:11.750
NOTHING.

06:11.792 --> 06:14.333
NEW MEDS?
DRUG OR ALCOHOL HISTORY?

06:14.375 --> 06:15.542
DAMN IT.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.458
ANOTHER 10 MILLIGRAMS
OF LORAZEPAM.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.875
PROTECT HER AIRWAY.

06:18.917 --> 06:21.000
(monitor beeping erratically)

06:21.041 --> 06:22.542
PULSE OX IS DROPPING.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.542
SHE'S NOT BREATHING.
WE MAY NEED TO TUBE HER.

06:24.583 --> 06:26.458
WAIT.
JUST GIVE IT A SEC.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.583
(beeping continues)

06:29.625 --> 06:31.500
(gasping)

06:31.542 --> 06:34.792
(exhales deeply)

06:34.834 --> 06:37.083
LET'S GET A C.T.
SEE WHAT'S UP.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.083
(railings clatter)

06:39.125 --> 06:40.959
KEEP ME IN THE LOOP?

06:42.458 --> 06:45.166
DR. SHEPHERD.

06:45.208 --> 06:46.500
IT'S FRIDAY.

06:48.291 --> 06:50.083
(woman on TV) WHAT DO YOU KIDS
WANT FOR DINNER?

06:50.125 --> 06:52.667
(children)
FRENCH FRIES! FRENCH FRIES!

06:52.709 --> 06:54.041
(man) THEY WANT FRENCH FRIES,

06:54.083 --> 06:55.458
AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO BREAK THE BANK.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.166
SO WHY NOT TURN THAT TIRED
SACK OF POTATOES

06:57.208 --> 06:59.583
INTO SOMETHING YOUR KIDS
ACTUALLY WANT

06:59.625 --> 07:01.625
WITH THE E-Z CUT
AMERICAN FRY MAKER?

07:01.667 --> 07:03.625
ADJUST THE BLADE SETTINGS,
AND SNAP!

07:03.667 --> 07:04.834
TRADITIONAL CUT...
(blade clinks)

07:04.875 --> 07:06.083
SHOESTRING...
(blade clinks)

07:06.125 --> 07:07.917
EVEN RESTAURANT-QUALITY
STEAK FRIES...

07:07.959 --> 07:09.041
(blade clinks)

07:09.083 --> 07:10.500
REALLY, REALLY GOOD FRIES.

07:10.542 --> 07:12.458
YOU KNOW BILLY'S
ON NORTH CANON?

07:12.500 --> 07:15.041
I'M THERE EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT.
REALLY, REALLY GOOD FRIES.

07:15.083 --> 07:17.250
(man) WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU HAD REALLY,

07:17.291 --> 07:19.250
REALLY GOOD
HOMEMADE FRIES?

07:19.291 --> 07:21.500
REALLY, REALLY GOOD FRIES
ARE HARD TO COME BY.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.375
(clicks tongue)

07:25.333 --> 07:29.333
REALLY, REALLY GOOD FRIES.
(sighs)

07:29.375 --> 07:30.542
(Amelia)
I PREFER STEAK FRIES,

07:30.583 --> 07:32.333
BUT I GUESS THESE WILL DO.

07:32.375 --> 07:35.375
(indistinct conversations)

07:37.041 --> 07:40.041
JUST BE CAREFUL
WITH THE KETCHUP.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.333
(Amelia) "SPEED"?

07:41.375 --> 07:43.041
YEAH. EVERY WOMAN I KNOW PREFERS
"SPEED" OVER "DIE HARD."

07:43.083 --> 07:45.792
OF COURSE THEY DO,
BECAUSE "SPEED'S" ABOUT KEANU

07:45.834 --> 07:47.166
DOING EVERYTHING THAT HE CAN
TO PROTECT SANDY.

07:47.208 --> 07:49.041
EVERY GIRL WANTS THAT.

07:49.083 --> 07:51.041
YOU HAVE
SUCH PRETTY EYES.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.458
ABANDONING
THE SUBTLE FLIRTATION THING.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.667
AND SMART...

07:54.709 --> 07:55.917
STOP.
AND CHALLENGING.

07:55.959 --> 07:57.041
ARE YOU ALWAYS
THIS AGGRESSIVE?

07:57.083 --> 07:58.792
I'M A DOUCHEY E.R. DOC,
REMEMBER?

07:58.834 --> 08:00.667
DOES IT WORK?
YOU'RE HERE.

08:00.709 --> 08:01.959
THAT DOES NOT ANSWER MY--

08:02.000 --> 08:03.041
ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER
THAT QUESTION.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.250
WHY DID YOU COME?

08:04.291 --> 08:07.333
I WANTED TO DISCUSS KAYE.

08:07.375 --> 08:08.792
OUR STABLE PATIENT
WHOSE TEST RESULTS

08:08.834 --> 08:10.500
WON'T BE COMPLETE
UNTIL THE MORNING?

08:10.542 --> 08:12.542
WHY DID YOU COME?

08:14.125 --> 08:15.917
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF I TOLD YOU

08:15.959 --> 08:17.750
THAT MY TV TOLD ME TO?

08:17.792 --> 08:19.500
DOES THAT HAPPEN OFTEN?

08:19.542 --> 08:21.291
MM. FIRST TIME.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.041
(indistinct conversations)

08:23.083 --> 08:24.709
WHAT TIME IS IT?

08:24.750 --> 08:26.208
I DON'T KNOW.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.208
WELL, YOU DIDN'T LOOK
AT YOUR WATCH.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.000
(chuckles)

08:34.375 --> 08:36.083
OH, MY GOD.

08:36.125 --> 08:38.208
IT IS ALMOST MIDNIGHT.
I GOTTA GO.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.792
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS.

08:40.834 --> 08:42.417
(sighs)

08:50.166 --> 08:51.458
(car door opens)

08:51.500 --> 08:53.041
PLEASE EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE
TO YOUR TELEVISION.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.834
MM. OH, UH, YOUR JACKET.

08:54.875 --> 08:56.625
NO. KEEP IT.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.041
THAT WAY, YOU HAVE TO
TALK TO ME AGAIN.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.041
AND IF YOU DON'T, I'LL HAVE YOU
ARRESTED FOR THEFT.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.333
(both laugh)

09:03.375 --> 09:06.291
THE VALET PROBABLY
WANTS TO GO, SO...

09:19.709 --> 09:21.166
OKAY.

09:21.208 --> 09:23.000
(mutters)

09:26.500 --> 09:27.709
(camera shutter clicks)

09:28.834 --> 09:30.667
(elevator bell dings)

09:30.709 --> 09:34.667
(people speaking indistinctly)

09:34.709 --> 09:36.667
WHEN A GIRL LETS A GUY
BUY HER DINNER,

09:36.709 --> 09:39.166
SHE HAS CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS.

09:39.208 --> 09:40.875
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:40.917 --> 09:43.875
"REALLY, REALLY GOOD FRIES
ARE HARD TO COME BY."

09:43.917 --> 09:45.041
YOU WERE IN MY HEAD.

09:45.083 --> 09:47.000
YOU WENT OUT WITH JAMES?

09:48.083 --> 09:49.542
BEING ALONE WASN'T TERRIBLE.

09:49.583 --> 09:50.959
I-I WAS NESTING.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.041
I WAS MAKING PROGRESS
ON MY APARTMENT...

09:53.083 --> 09:54.041
SORT OF.

09:54.083 --> 09:55.834
NOW ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT

09:55.875 --> 09:57.625
IS MIXED-MESSAGE JAMES
NOT KISSING ME.

09:57.667 --> 09:59.667
I MEAN, I AM NOT THE GIRL
WHO SITS AROUND

09:59.709 --> 10:00.959
TRYING TO UNMIX MESSAGES.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.041
I MIX THEM.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.333
I THINK I FOLLOW THAT.

10:03.375 --> 10:05.083
LOOK, THIS...

10:05.125 --> 10:06.917
THIS PART OF THE RELATIONSHIP
HAPPENS ONLY ONCE.

10:06.959 --> 10:08.709
THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP.
(chuckles)

10:08.750 --> 10:10.709
OKAY, WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS,

10:10.750 --> 10:12.667
LET THE ATTRACTION
PERCOLATE.

10:12.709 --> 10:14.333
PLAY HARD TO GET?

10:14.375 --> 10:15.542
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

10:15.583 --> 10:17.000
BUT IT DOES WORK.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.041
YEAH.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.166
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

10:22.208 --> 10:23.375
KAYE HAS NO TRAUMA

10:23.417 --> 10:25.291
OR FAMILY HISTORY
OF EPILEPSY.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.917
TOX SCREEN IS NEGATIVE.
NOT DRUGS.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.542
ELECTROLYTES?

10:29.583 --> 10:31.709
NORMAL.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.333
DO YOU HAVE PLANS
TONIGHT?

10:35.333 --> 10:37.291
I DO.

10:37.333 --> 10:38.917
WELL, WHEN YOU HAVE TIME,

10:38.959 --> 10:41.291
I'D LOVE TO TAKE YOU TO
MY FAVORITE ITALIAN PLACE.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.542
YEAH. I'M PRETTY BUSY
UNTIL NEXT WEEK.

10:43.583 --> 10:45.583
KAYE IS NEW TO L.A.?

10:45.625 --> 10:47.500
UH, ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO.

10:47.542 --> 10:49.500
HMM. THE DESERT.

10:49.542 --> 10:51.667
ENVIRONMENTAL?

10:51.709 --> 10:53.583
FUNGUS. A-A FUNGAL INFECTION,
MAYBE?

10:53.625 --> 10:56.083
TITERS ARE HIGH
FOR COCCI MENINGITIS.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.625
OKAY.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.709
WELL, NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS FIND THE LESIONS

11:00.750 --> 11:03.917
AND...

11:03.959 --> 11:05.041
FOUND ONE.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.792
RIGHT HERE
IN THE CORTICAL AREA.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.709
I'LL SCHEDULE A BIOPSY
FOR TOMORROW.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.291
YOU'RE GONNA DO
BRAIN SURGERY?

11:10.333 --> 11:12.709
WELL, A BIOPSY WILL CONFIRM
THE DIAGNOSIS.

11:12.750 --> 11:13.917
YOU'RE GONNA CUT INTO HER HEAD

11:13.959 --> 11:15.041
WHEN WE COULD TREAT HER
WITH ANTIFUNGALS

11:15.083 --> 11:16.500
AND KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON HER?

11:16.542 --> 11:20.208
MY WAY IS FASTER
AND DEFINITIVE.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.417
IT'LL ALSO TAKE HER
OUT OF AUDITIONS

11:21.458 --> 11:23.500
FOR LONGER
THAN SHE CAN AFFORD.

11:23.542 --> 11:25.417
ALL SIGNS POINT TO
A FUNGAL INFECTION,

11:25.458 --> 11:27.583
WHICH, IF YOU DON'T MIND
ME SAYING,

11:27.625 --> 11:28.834
WAS A MAGNIFICENT CATCH.

11:28.875 --> 11:30.750
OKAY. DON'T TRY
TO SUCK UP TO ME

11:30.792 --> 11:32.333
JUST SO THAT I'LL DO
WHAT YOU WANT.

11:32.375 --> 11:34.041
I WASN'T. IT WAS MAGNIFICENT.

11:34.083 --> 11:35.250
UH-HUH.

11:35.291 --> 11:36.667
BUT I WAS HOPING
GETTING MY WAY

11:36.709 --> 11:38.041
WOULD BE AN UNINTENDED BENEFIT
OF STATING THE TRUTH.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.500
WE CAN SCHEDULE
A FOLLOW-UP C.T. IN A MONTH.

11:42.291 --> 11:45.250
(exhales deeply)

11:45.291 --> 11:46.458
SHE STAYS
ON THE ANTICONVULSANTS,

11:46.500 --> 11:50.375
AND WE SCHEDULE A FOLLOW-UP
IN A WEEK.

11:50.417 --> 11:53.000
ARE YOU REALLY BUSY TONIGHT
OR ARE YOU PLAYING HARD TO GET?

11:53.041 --> 11:56.834
WELL, I... (scoffs) HAVE
A LOT ON MY PLATE RIGHT NOW.

11:56.875 --> 12:01.333
IF NEXT WEEK IS THE SOONEST
I CAN SEE YOU, OKAY, BUT...

12:01.375 --> 12:05.041
I WAS REALLY HOPING TO SPEND
SOME TIME WITH YOU BEFORE THEN.

12:05.083 --> 12:08.000
HOW DID YOU SCORE A TABLE
OVERLOOKING THE KITCHEN?

12:08.041 --> 12:10.083
I TOOK CARE
OF THE CHEF'S DAUGHTER

12:10.125 --> 12:11.291
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

12:11.333 --> 12:13.208
HIGH FEVER, VOMITING.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.709
MY INTERN DIAGNOSED THE FLU,
WAS ABOUT TO SEND HER HOME,

12:15.750 --> 12:18.041
BUT I HAD A FEELING.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.875
WE DID A SPINAL TAP--

12:19.917 --> 12:21.250
BACTERIAL MENINGITIS.

12:21.291 --> 12:24.458
I SAVED HER.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.792
WELL... THIS IS ME.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.250
(alarm chirps)

12:30.291 --> 12:32.250
(clears throat)

12:32.291 --> 12:36.500
THANK YOU FOR DINNER.
THAT WAS REALLY LOVELY.

12:36.542 --> 12:38.917
I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.000
ME, TOO.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.250
GET HOME SAFELY.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.083
YEAH.

12:50.125 --> 12:53.583
OKAY.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.041
(Amelia)
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.041
I'M HOT.
I WOULD KISS ME.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.375
WOULDN'T YOU KISS ME?

13:00.417 --> 13:01.875
ABSOLUTELY.
I WOULD, YES.

13:01.917 --> 13:04.041
I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS.
HE PURSUED ME.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.458
WOULD NOT LET IT GO.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.250
FINALLY I GAVE IN,
THIS IS WHAT I GET.

13:07.291 --> 13:09.458
YOU CAN'T LET IT
UPSET YOU.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.792
I'M NOT UPSET. I'M PISSED.

13:10.834 --> 13:12.875
MAYBE HE'S JUST
NOT THAT INTO YOU.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.041
(laughs)

13:14.083 --> 13:15.125
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO SAY THAT.

13:15.166 --> 13:17.041
MAYBE NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME,
ADDISON. (laughs)

13:17.083 --> 13:19.500
I GOT WAXED.
LIKE "WAXED" WAXED.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.083
I SPENT A SMALL FORTUNE
ON NEW UNDERWEAR AND HEELS,

13:21.125 --> 13:23.709
BOTH OF WHICH ARE
SUPREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE,

13:23.750 --> 13:25.041
AND FOR WHAT?

13:25.083 --> 13:27.792
OH, THE THINGS WE DO.
WOMEN.

13:27.834 --> 13:30.041
I MEAN, WHY, WHEN WE COULD BE
ON OUR COUCH IN SWEATS,

13:30.083 --> 13:32.875
VEGGING OUT TO A MARATHON
OF "BITCH SNAPPED"?

13:32.917 --> 13:34.083
BECAUSE YOU LIKE HIM.

13:34.125 --> 13:35.041
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING
THAT JUSTIFIES

13:35.083 --> 13:37.083
THE PAIN I'M INFLICTING
UPON MYSELF.

13:37.125 --> 13:38.458
DO YOU THINK HE'S--

13:38.500 --> 13:39.667
HE'S NOT GAY.

13:39.709 --> 13:40.792
MAYBE HE GOT OVER
A REALLY BAD BREAK-UP

13:40.834 --> 13:42.375
AND HE WANTS TO GO SLOWLY.
MM.

13:42.417 --> 13:44.041
IS THAT REALLY A THING,
GOING SLOWLY?

13:44.083 --> 13:45.375
I MEAN, DOESN'T THAT
ONLY HAPPEN IN THE MOVIES?

13:45.417 --> 13:47.041
I'M DONE. I'M J--I'M DONE.

13:47.083 --> 13:48.625
NO, YOU CANNOT QUIT.

13:48.667 --> 13:50.625
AND YOU CAN'T PUT
ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.041
THE QUEST TO FIND SOMEBODY

13:52.083 --> 13:54.208
TO SPEND YOUR LIFE WITH
IS NOT EASY.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.041
YOU NEED TIME AND FORTITUDE.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.417
DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?

13:57.458 --> 13:59.125
I-I WAS JUST LOOKING TO GET
OUT OF MY APARTMENT.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.041
OKAY. WELL...
(snaps)

14:01.083 --> 14:02.583
THEN STAYING IN THAT VEIN,
HUMOR ME A LITTLE LONGER.

14:02.625 --> 14:03.917
ARE YOU FREE TONIGHT?

14:03.959 --> 14:05.291
NO, REALLY.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.041
I MEAN, YOU COULD STAY HOME...

14:07.083 --> 14:09.083
(whiny voice) AND WONDER WHY
JAMES ISN'T KISSING YOU...

14:09.125 --> 14:10.709
(normal voice) OR...

14:10.750 --> 14:12.041
AH.

14:12.083 --> 14:13.500
ORTHO SURGEON.

14:13.542 --> 14:15.959
TOTALLY SINGLE.
GREAT CONVERSATIONALIST.

14:16.041 --> 14:17.792
MM.
DEFINITELY NOT A SOCIOPATH.

14:17.834 --> 14:20.375
WANT ME TO SEE
IF HE'S FREE TONIGHT?

14:22.291 --> 14:24.083
WELL, YOU'RE ALREADY WAXED.

14:25.709 --> 14:27.375
(knock on door)

14:27.417 --> 14:29.375
MM. OKAY.

14:31.083 --> 14:32.250
JAMES.

14:32.291 --> 14:34.625
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
DATE?

14:34.667 --> 14:37.125
YEAH. I, UH, ACTUALLY
WAS ON MY WAY OUT.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.458
COOL.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.125
I CAN'T STAY BUT A MINUTE.
MIDDLE OF MY SHIFT.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.667
IT'S JUST...

14:42.709 --> 14:46.709
THE ANTICIPATION
WAS KILLING ME.

15:12.917 --> 15:15.000
ENJOY YOUR DATE.

15:22.083 --> 15:23.125
(camera shutter clicks)

15:25.125 --> 15:26.834
(Kaye) GONE?

15:26.875 --> 15:28.417
LIKE--LIKE COMPLETELY GONE?

15:28.458 --> 15:30.041
THERE'S NO TRACE
OF THE LESION.

15:30.083 --> 15:32.125
THE ANTIFUNGALS
WERE EFFECTIVE.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.959
SO NO MORE FALLING
ON MY FACE AT AUDITIONS

15:34.000 --> 15:35.333
IN THE LITERAL SENSE?

15:35.375 --> 15:36.542
THERE IS NO REASON TO SUSPECT

15:36.583 --> 15:37.959
THAT YOU'LL HAVE
ANOTHER SEIZURE.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.125
I'D ALREADY CALLED MY DAD

15:39.166 --> 15:41.041
AND TOLD HIM THAT I
MIGHT HAVE TO COME HOME.

15:41.083 --> 15:44.208
(exhales) THANK YOU.

15:44.250 --> 15:46.041
BOTH OF YOU. (laughs)
(chuckles)

15:46.083 --> 15:47.458
OH, IF I LEAVE NOW,

15:47.500 --> 15:49.542
I CAN STILL MAKE IT
TO MY CLASS ACROSS TOWN.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.333
(laughs) THANKS.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.041
(squeals)

15:54.083 --> 15:55.291
(door closes)

15:55.333 --> 15:57.041
DID YOU EVER HAVE
THAT MUCH ENERGY?

15:57.083 --> 15:58.166
YEP.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.500
I KNOW I SHOULD WAIT
UNTIL TONIGHT,

15:59.542 --> 16:00.959
BUT NOW THAT
THE PATIENT'S GONE...

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
YOU CAN TOTALLY KISS ME.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.041
CONDOMS--

16:09.083 --> 16:11.291
RIBBED, GLOW-IN-THE-DARK,
TINGLING?

16:11.333 --> 16:14.041
WHICH IS USUALLY THE SENSATION
THAT SENDS YOU TO THE DOCTOR.

16:14.083 --> 16:15.500
SLOW DOWN. BACK IT UP.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.083
I'M SEEING SOMEONE.

16:17.125 --> 16:18.291
JAMES.

16:18.333 --> 16:19.500
YOU KNOW?
OF COURSE YOU KNOW.

16:19.542 --> 16:20.709
DOESN'T MATTER.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.083
WHAT MATTERS IS,
I WENT TO BUY CONDOMS TODAY,

16:22.125 --> 16:24.458
AND THERE ARE, LIKE,
A BILLION CHOICES,

16:24.500 --> 16:27.000
AND I DON'T WANT TO INSULT HIM
BY NOT BUYING MAGNUMS

16:27.041 --> 16:28.375
OR BUYING THEM
AND MAKING HIM THINK

16:28.417 --> 16:30.375
THAT MY PREVIOUS BOYFRIENDS
ARE THE LAKERS.

16:30.417 --> 16:32.083
WELL, SINCE WHEN
ARE YOU SHY ABOUT SEX?

16:32.125 --> 16:34.583
I--I'M NOT. I JUST
DON'T WANT TO OFFEND JAMES.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.041
AH, THAT'S CRAP.
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT YOU

16:36.083 --> 16:38.125
GETTIN' BACK IN THE SADDLE
AFTER A YEAR.

16:38.166 --> 16:40.041
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.917
YOU DOIN'
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO?

16:41.959 --> 16:43.417
I'M HERE TALKING TO YOU.

16:43.458 --> 16:44.917
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

16:44.959 --> 16:46.083
I AM GETTING TO MEETINGS.

16:46.125 --> 16:48.083
YOU KNOW WHY I'M ASKING.
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE ASKING.

16:48.125 --> 16:49.500
WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE NEW,

16:49.542 --> 16:51.500
SOMETIMES SOBRIETY
TAKES A BACKSEAT.

16:51.542 --> 16:53.041
YOU START CUTTING CORNERS,
AND THEN...

16:53.083 --> 16:54.834
YOU SLIP. I GET IT.

16:54.875 --> 16:57.291
LAST TIME YOU HAD SEX,
YOU WOKE UP TO--

16:57.333 --> 16:58.750
A DEAD RYAN.

16:58.792 --> 17:01.709
YES... I REMEMBER.

17:01.750 --> 17:04.125
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE
A THING.

17:04.166 --> 17:05.250
YOU SURE?

17:05.291 --> 17:08.125
I'M SURE. I'M READY.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.083
I JUST NEED THAT PUSH.

17:13.917 --> 17:17.000
OH. (sighs)

17:23.500 --> 17:26.000
AHH.

17:26.041 --> 17:27.041
RIBBED,

17:27.083 --> 17:29.667
GLOW-IN THE DARK,
TINGLING.

17:29.709 --> 17:31.875
THEY CALL THIS ONE
"THE SOLDIER."

17:31.917 --> 17:33.041
HUH.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.250
TRIAL AND ERROR.

17:34.291 --> 17:36.291
FIND OUT WHAT WORKS
FOR YOU,

17:36.333 --> 17:37.583
AND HAVE FUN DOING IT.

17:37.625 --> 17:38.834
(exhales)

17:38.875 --> 17:42.750
OH. JUST IN CASE.

17:44.834 --> 17:46.041
(knock on door)

17:46.083 --> 17:47.917
(latch clicks)

17:50.959 --> 17:52.041
HEY.

17:52.083 --> 17:54.291
WOW.

18:00.625 --> 18:04.041
(both panting)

18:04.083 --> 18:07.000
(both moaning)

18:15.083 --> 18:16.208
YEAH?

18:16.250 --> 18:18.041
PLEASE.

18:18.083 --> 18:20.792
(both panting)

18:25.792 --> 18:27.083
HEY.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.750
WOW.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.542
(panting)

18:30.583 --> 18:33.083
(moans)

18:39.000 --> 18:40.709
DO YOU HAVE A CONDOM?

18:40.750 --> 18:43.792
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
PRESUMPTUOUS.

18:43.834 --> 18:45.041
I HAVE SOME.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.792
I THINK.

18:52.375 --> 18:55.041
YOU ARE SO GORGEOUS.

18:55.083 --> 18:58.917
(panting)

18:58.959 --> 19:01.208
(distorted voice)
YOU ARE SO GORGEOUS.

19:08.583 --> 19:11.500
(clanks)

19:16.583 --> 19:18.917
(speaks and cries inaudibly)

19:18.959 --> 19:20.500
(clanks)
(pants)

19:20.542 --> 19:22.041
WHAT'S WRONG?

19:22.083 --> 19:24.208
SORRY. UH...

19:24.250 --> 19:26.000
CAN YOU NOT TOUCH ME?

19:30.083 --> 19:32.208
ARE YOU--

19:32.250 --> 19:33.625
(panting)

19:33.667 --> 19:35.792
(door opens and closes)

19:47.750 --> 19:50.000
YOU'RE HERE.

19:51.375 --> 19:52.834
YEAH.

19:52.875 --> 19:54.041
I GOT THIS THING

19:54.083 --> 19:56.041
WHERE I CAN'T LET A DATE
END IN TEARS, SO...

19:56.083 --> 19:58.291
(pops)

20:00.083 --> 20:02.875
I WAS GONNA
MAKE YOU BREAKFAST, BUT...

20:02.917 --> 20:06.959
YOU ONLY HAVE
SALSA, ICE CREAM, AND BREAD.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.875
BON APPETIT.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.166
(plates scrape counter)

20:12.291 --> 20:15.041
I OWE YOU AN EXPLANATION.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.500
YOU DON'T.

20:20.166 --> 20:22.458
I LIKE YOU.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.917
AND LAST NIGHT,
I WANTED TO.

20:24.959 --> 20:26.709
I MEAN,
I'VE GOT ENOUGH CONDOMS

20:26.750 --> 20:28.166
TO SUPPLY A FRAT HOUSE.

20:28.208 --> 20:29.917
(chuckles)

20:31.291 --> 20:34.125
I THOUGHT I WAS READY.

20:35.709 --> 20:39.500
BUT THEN WHEN YOU STARTED
TAKING OFF MY DRESS...

20:39.542 --> 20:43.041
(exhales)

20:43.083 --> 20:46.458
I HAVEN'T HAD SEX WITH SOMEONE
WHO MATTERED IN A LONG TIME.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.500
AND NOW I'M SOBER,

20:49.542 --> 20:51.041
AND I'M IN A GOOD PLACE,

20:51.083 --> 20:52.709
BUT IN SOME WAYS
I'M STILL A MESS.

20:52.750 --> 20:58.041
SO... (exhales)

20:58.083 --> 21:00.208
I'M GIVING YOU AN OUT.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.041
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ON YOUR TOAST,

21:23.083 --> 21:25.041
SALSA OR ICE CREAM?

22:14.542 --> 22:15.750
(camera shutter clicks)

22:27.333 --> 22:29.208
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT?

22:29.250 --> 22:31.041
YOU.

22:32.834 --> 22:34.959
NO, WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

22:35.000 --> 22:36.834
I HAVE A FRECKLE.

22:38.083 --> 22:40.041
WHAT ABOUT IT?

22:40.083 --> 22:43.041
IT LOOKS LIKE INDIANA.

22:43.083 --> 22:45.625
CAN I KISS IT?

22:45.667 --> 22:48.792
MM. YOU'RE GOING TO ANYWAY.

22:56.667 --> 23:01.333
I SEE A FEW MORE DOWN HERE
THAT REQUIRE MY ATTENTION.

23:01.375 --> 23:05.417
(laughing)
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

23:05.458 --> 23:08.500
(sighs)

23:13.917 --> 23:16.083
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

23:17.834 --> 23:20.041
I DON'T KNOW.

23:20.083 --> 23:22.333
DON'T KNOW OR WON'T SAY?

23:25.250 --> 23:28.083
I'M NOT
THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING.

23:30.875 --> 23:33.000
AND THAT'S GOOD.

23:50.667 --> 23:53.000
WHY DON'T YOU DRINK?

23:56.083 --> 23:57.083
YOU DON'T REALLY--

23:57.125 --> 23:58.291
I DO.

23:58.333 --> 24:00.458
REALLY.

24:04.083 --> 24:06.250
I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

24:07.875 --> 24:09.959
AND I USED TO DO OXY.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.041
I FELL IN LOVE,

24:13.083 --> 24:15.709
I THOUGHT, WITH AN ADDICT.

24:15.750 --> 24:18.041
MM.

24:18.083 --> 24:22.333
I DON'T KNOW WHY I SAID
"I THOUGHT."

24:22.375 --> 24:24.375
I MEAN...

24:24.417 --> 24:27.375
I DO.

24:27.417 --> 24:30.458
IT'S BECAUSE
I'M NOT SURE ANYMORE

24:30.500 --> 24:32.959
IF I WAS ACTUALLY
IN LOVE WITH HIM, BUT...

24:34.166 --> 24:36.041
TO SAY THAT I WASN'T
FEELS COLD

24:36.083 --> 24:38.166
BECAUSE...

24:38.208 --> 24:40.417
HE'S GONE.

24:43.417 --> 24:45.375
I WOKE UP
FROM THIS AMAZING HIGH

24:45.417 --> 24:47.000
TO FIND HIM DEAD.

24:50.208 --> 24:52.041
AND IT DIDN'T FEEL FAIR

24:52.083 --> 24:54.000
WHEN I FOUND OUT
I WAS PREGNANT.

24:56.458 --> 24:59.709
THIS BABY...

24:59.750 --> 25:02.375
OUR BABY
HELPED ME STAY CLEAN.

25:02.417 --> 25:05.083
MAYBE IT WOULD'VE
GOTTEN HIM CLEAN

25:05.125 --> 25:07.000
AND WE COULD'VE...

25:14.000 --> 25:16.041
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
BEING IN LOVE WITH HIM

25:16.083 --> 25:20.041
BECAUSE THAT TIME
IN MY LIFE...

25:20.083 --> 25:22.000
THE DRUGS...

25:24.000 --> 25:26.375
I LIVED IT, BUT...

25:28.583 --> 25:32.208
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
MY LIFE.

25:32.250 --> 25:35.041
YOU LOVED HIM.

25:35.083 --> 25:39.041
WE WERE SOBER TOGETHER
FOR, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.834
IF IT FELT LIKE LOVE,
THEN IT WAS.

25:41.875 --> 25:44.041
DON'T LET THE PERSPECTIVE
YOU HAVE NOW

25:44.083 --> 25:46.166
DIMINISH THE FEELINGS
YOU HAD THEN.

25:46.208 --> 25:48.667
THAT WOULDN'T BE FAIR.

25:53.250 --> 25:55.041
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN IN LOVE?

25:55.083 --> 25:58.041
COUPLE TIMES.

25:58.083 --> 26:00.041
NOT COUNTING HALLE BERRY.

26:00.083 --> 26:01.250
(chuckles)

26:01.291 --> 26:02.500
(chuckles)

26:02.542 --> 26:04.834
WHAT HAPPENED?

26:04.875 --> 26:06.000
WITH HALLE?

26:06.041 --> 26:07.041
MM-HMM.

26:07.083 --> 26:08.166
(chuckles) I KNEW
I WANTED TO SEE

26:08.208 --> 26:10.041
MORE THAN
DICKSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE.

26:12.542 --> 26:14.709
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT.

26:14.750 --> 26:16.667
WHEN YOU GOT AN HOUR,
I'LL SHOW YOU.

26:24.875 --> 26:27.875
(thunder rumbling)

26:30.375 --> 26:34.041
SOMETHING JUST DOESN'T
SIT RIGHT.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.834
IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU THAT
THERE WAS ONLY ONE LESION?

26:36.875 --> 26:38.041
KAYE?

26:38.083 --> 26:39.041
YEAH.

26:39.083 --> 26:40.458
IT WOULD BOTHER ME
IF SHE WERE PRESENTING

26:40.500 --> 26:41.875
WITH MORE LESIONS
OR MORE SEIZURES,

26:41.917 --> 26:43.750
BUT SHE'S NOT.

26:43.792 --> 26:45.667
(thunder crashes)

26:45.709 --> 26:46.875
I DON'T KNOW.

26:46.917 --> 26:49.458
HER TITERS WERE HIGH,
BUT NOT INCREDIBLY.

26:49.500 --> 26:53.750
AMELIA, YOU DID GREAT
FOR KAYE.

26:57.083 --> 27:00.041
SHE'S HALFWAY TO AN OSCAR
AS WE SPEAK.

27:00.083 --> 27:02.417
TAKE THE VICTORY.

27:02.458 --> 27:03.667
MM.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.166
(inhales deeply)

27:06.583 --> 27:07.875
(man) THIS IS
A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT

27:07.917 --> 27:09.875
FROM THE AMERICAN SOCI--

27:09.917 --> 27:11.250
(channel changes)
(man) THROWS IT OUT OF BOUNDS,
AND THAT'S GONNA--

27:11.291 --> 27:13.041
(channel changes)
(woman) WITH HAPPY DOG
DOG CHOW--

27:13.083 --> 27:14.709
(channel changes)
(man) LISTEN,
THE CONSERVATIVES CAN SAY...

27:14.750 --> 27:17.041
NOT THIS WINDBAG AGAIN,
PLEASE.

27:17.083 --> 27:19.500
HOW DO YOU KEEP UP WITH
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD?

27:19.542 --> 27:21.083
I READ THE PAPER.

27:21.125 --> 27:23.667
MM. SMARTY-PANTS
PROBABLY HAS A SUBSCRIPTION

27:23.709 --> 27:25.041
TO THE "TIMES."

27:25.083 --> 27:26.291
THE "JOURNAL."

27:26.333 --> 27:29.041
I PREFER OBJECTIVITY
IN MY NEWS.

27:29.083 --> 27:30.375
YOU'RE CALLING OUT

27:30.417 --> 27:32.333
ONE OF THE MOST ESTEEMED
NEWS PUBLICATIONS IN THE WORLD

27:32.375 --> 27:34.000
FOR A LACK OF OBJECTIVITY?

27:34.041 --> 27:35.166
HOW CAN IT BE OBJECTIVE

27:35.208 --> 27:37.959
IF ALL OF ITS REPORTERS
ARE PROGRESSIVES?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.333
(man speaking indistinctly
on TV)

27:40.375 --> 27:42.583
WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR?

27:42.625 --> 27:45.417
IN THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL...

27:45.458 --> 27:47.417
WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR?

27:47.458 --> 27:48.834
IT'S CALLED A SECRET BALLOT,

27:48.875 --> 27:50.709
AND IT'S THE FOUNDATION
OF OUR DEMOCRACY.

27:50.750 --> 27:52.041
YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN.

27:52.083 --> 27:53.625
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T TELL YOU
WHO I VOTED FOR? (laughs)

27:53.667 --> 27:55.208
BECAUSE YOU ENDED
A SENTENCE WITH

27:55.250 --> 27:56.959
"FOUNDATION OF OUR DEMOCRACY."

27:57.000 --> 27:58.291
I'M A CONSERVATIVE.

27:58.333 --> 27:59.834
JUST SAY YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN.
NO.

27:59.875 --> 28:01.375
WHY?
BECAUSE YOU REALLY,
REALLY WANT ME TO.

28:01.417 --> 28:02.834
I'M IN BED WITH A REPUBLICAN.

28:02.875 --> 28:04.041
I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.041
JUST THINK BACK TO
THE BEST SEX YOU'VE EVER HAD.

28:06.083 --> 28:07.542
NOT FUNNY.

28:07.583 --> 28:08.625
DEAL BREAKER?
ABORTION?

28:08.667 --> 28:10.750
PRO-LIFE.
THE DEATH PENALTY?

28:10.792 --> 28:12.625
THIS IS THE SEXIEST
PILLOW TALK EVER.

28:12.667 --> 28:14.834
DON'T TRY TO AVOID IT.

28:14.875 --> 28:16.041
THE BIBLE SAYS
"AN EYE FOR AN EYE."

28:16.083 --> 28:17.458
OHH!

28:17.500 --> 28:20.041
ALL RIGHT, THAT LOGIC
DRIVES ME CRAZY!

28:20.083 --> 28:21.417
YOU JUST SAID
THAT YOUR FOR LIFE,

28:21.458 --> 28:22.625
BUT YOU'RE FOR
THE DEATH PENALTY?

28:22.667 --> 28:24.834
I AM FOR LIFE--
INNOCENT LIFE.

28:24.875 --> 28:27.041
WHOSE JOB IS IT TO JUDGE
INNOCENCE AND GUILT?

28:27.083 --> 28:29.041
DOES THE PERSON WHO TOOK
SARAH NELSON DESERVE TO LIVE?

28:29.083 --> 28:30.417
DOESN'T THE BIBLE ALSO SAY
SOMETHING ABOUT

28:30.458 --> 28:32.000
TURN THE OTHER CHEEK

28:32.041 --> 28:33.542
AND GOD'S THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN
JUDGE AND STUFF LIKE THAT?

28:33.583 --> 28:34.750
WOULDN'T HAVE PEGGED YOU

28:34.792 --> 28:35.959
AS SOMEONE WHO WOULD
QUOTE SCRIPTURE.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.041
I DID NOT QUOTE SCRIPTURE.
I PARAPHRASED.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.417
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT STUFF.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.959
(indistinct conversations)

30:44.000 --> 30:45.709
HEY. YOUR PARENTS
GET IN ALL RIGHT?

30:45.750 --> 30:47.166
AT THE HOTEL NOW.

30:47.208 --> 30:49.583
I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN
WITH YOU ABOUT TONIGHT.

30:49.625 --> 30:52.000
5:00 BECAUSE THEY'RE
ON EAST COAST TIME.

30:52.041 --> 30:53.417
THAT CHAIN RESTAURANT
IN THE MALL

30:53.458 --> 30:55.166
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALLERGIC
TO NEW EXPERIENCES.

30:55.208 --> 30:57.667
I MEAN, YOU'RE SURE
THIS IS SOMETHING

30:57.709 --> 30:59.041
YOU'RE READY TO DO?

30:59.083 --> 31:01.291
I... IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'LL
NEVER BE IN L.A. AGAIN.

31:01.333 --> 31:02.625
LOOK, IF YOU'VE
CHANGED YOUR MIND

31:02.667 --> 31:04.041
AND YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO MEET THEM--

31:04.083 --> 31:05.750
NO, NO, NO,
IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S--

31:05.792 --> 31:07.583
WHAT IS IT?

31:07.625 --> 31:08.792
I DREAMT LAST NIGHT

31:08.834 --> 31:10.375
THAT THE CEILING
IN THE RESTAURANT COLLAPSED.

31:10.417 --> 31:11.792
EVERYONE WAS ALL RIGHT,

31:11.834 --> 31:13.041
BUT... I DON'T KNOW.

31:13.083 --> 31:15.000
MEETING THE FOLKS
IS A BIG DEAL.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.041
IS THIS YOU FREAKING OUT?

31:17.083 --> 31:18.417
NO.

31:18.458 --> 31:20.000
YEAH.

31:20.041 --> 31:21.041
SORT OF.
I THINK IT IS.

31:21.083 --> 31:22.834
(laughs)
I'M YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

31:22.875 --> 31:26.375
AND I AM TOTALLY EXCITED
TO MEET YOUR PARENTS.

31:26.417 --> 31:29.625
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

31:32.083 --> 31:33.583
(James) I WANTED THEM
TO EXPERIENCE L.A.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.583
HE TOOK US
TO ONE OF THOSE RESTAURANTS

31:35.625 --> 31:37.583
WHERE THEY DON'T COOK
THE FOOD.

31:37.625 --> 31:39.041
(laughs) FOR MY MONEY,

31:39.083 --> 31:41.625
YOU CAN'T BEAT A RESTAURANT
WITH AN UNLIMITED SALAD BAR.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.041
(Amelia) WELL, I WISH
THEY WOULD PUT A LIMIT

31:43.083 --> 31:44.208
ON THESE CHEESE BISCUITS.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.083
I AM NOT GONNA FIT
INTO MY SCRUBS TOMORROW.

31:46.125 --> 31:48.208
(laughs)
(laughs) THAT'S A GOOD ONE,
AMELIA.

31:48.250 --> 31:50.667
YOU KNOW,
I WAS NOT EXPECTING

31:50.709 --> 31:52.041
TO LIKE YOU AS MUCH AS I DO.

31:52.083 --> 31:54.166
MOM.
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT.

31:54.208 --> 31:56.041
I JUST ALWAYS ENVISIONED
THAT YOU WOULD

31:56.083 --> 31:58.000
SETTLE DOWN
SOMEWHERE NEAR US

31:58.041 --> 32:01.667
AND MARRY A LOCAL GAL.

32:01.709 --> 32:03.917
(huffs)
(man) OH, LET'S, UH,

32:03.959 --> 32:05.959
LET'S TOAST TO NEW FRIENDS.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.041
NEW FRIENDS.
HEAR, HEAR.

32:07.083 --> 32:08.125
(James) NEW FRIENDS.

32:08.166 --> 32:09.750
SO, AMELIA, DO YOU HAVE
ANY SIBLINGS?

32:09.792 --> 32:11.458
THREE SISTERS, ONE BROTHER.
(inhales sharply)

32:11.500 --> 32:12.959
ALL DOCTORS.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.458
OH. DID YOUR MOTHER WORK?

32:14.500 --> 32:17.208
YEAH, SHE WAS A NURSE
IN THE NAVY FOR 25 YEARS.

32:17.250 --> 32:19.250
HUH.
THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE Y'ALL
GOT THE IDEA TO BE DOCTORS.

32:19.291 --> 32:20.458
MM.

32:20.500 --> 32:21.875
I TEACH ENGLISH.

32:21.917 --> 32:24.834
NO IDEA WHERE HE GOT
AN APTITUDE FOR SCIENCE.

32:24.875 --> 32:26.041
BUT I COULDN'T BE PROUDER.

32:26.083 --> 32:27.041
(chuckles)

32:27.083 --> 32:28.917
AH, I JUST DIRECT TRAFFIC
IN THE E.R.

32:28.959 --> 32:30.041
AMELIA'S THE GENIUS
AT THE TABLE.

32:30.083 --> 32:31.125
HE'S BEING MODEST.

32:31.166 --> 32:32.542
THE NIGHT WE MET,
HE CAUGHT SOMETHING I MISSED,

32:32.583 --> 32:33.875
SAVED A MAN'S LIFE.

32:33.917 --> 32:35.041
WELL, I'M NOT
THE LEAST BIT SURPRISED,

32:35.083 --> 32:37.250
BUT THEN I MIGHT BE
A TEENY BIT BIASED.

32:37.291 --> 32:38.917
(laughs)

32:38.959 --> 32:41.000
IT IS COOL SEEING THE THREE
OF YOU TOGETHER AS A FAMILY.

32:41.041 --> 32:42.750
YOU GUYS...
GET ALONG REALLY WELL.

32:42.792 --> 32:44.000
IT'S NICE.

32:44.041 --> 32:46.041
WELL, THAT IS SO SWEET
OF YOU TO SAY, HON.

32:46.083 --> 32:47.583
YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT MIGHT HAVE TO DO

32:47.625 --> 32:49.041
WITH THE FACT
THAT I WAS ABLE

32:49.083 --> 32:51.041
TO BE AT HOME
WHEN HE WAS GROWING UP.

32:51.083 --> 32:53.125
WHAT KIND OF SURGERY
DO YOU PRACTICE?

32:53.166 --> 32:54.333
I'M A NEUROSURGEON.
OH.

32:54.375 --> 32:55.750
(man) AMELIA.

32:55.792 --> 32:58.041
YOUR JOB SOUNDS AS HARD
AS... ROCKET SCIENCE.

32:58.083 --> 32:59.166
(laughs)

32:59.208 --> 33:01.750
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU COULD
EVER DO PART-TIME?

33:01.792 --> 33:03.041
MOM,
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

33:03.083 --> 33:04.959
WHY WOULD I DO
THE THING I LOVE PART-TIME?

33:05.000 --> 33:07.750
WELL, I WAS THINKING, IF YOU
EVER WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN...

33:07.792 --> 33:08.959
I WON'T QUIT WORKING.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.500
AMELIA,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER.

33:10.542 --> 33:12.000
MOM, NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

33:12.041 --> 33:14.125
I AM JUST MAKING
POLITE CONVERSATION.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.333
IT'S OKAY.
I CAN ANSWER.

33:15.375 --> 33:16.959
SHE PROMISED
NOT TO INTERROGATE YOU.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.375
WELL, IT'S NOT
AN INTERROGATION.
YOU SEE?

33:19.417 --> 33:22.000
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE TAKEN CARE OF.

33:22.041 --> 33:24.375
MOM, NOT THE PLACE,
NOT THE TIME,

33:24.417 --> 33:26.000
NOT YOUR BUSINESS.

33:26.041 --> 33:27.333
LET'S MOVE ON.

33:27.375 --> 33:28.750
(indistinct conversations)

33:28.792 --> 33:31.041
WELL, I'M GONNA HAVE
THE CHICKEN PARMESAN.

33:31.083 --> 33:32.125
(woman)
OOH, THAT DOES SOUND GOOD.

33:32.166 --> 33:33.333
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD.

33:33.375 --> 33:35.583
HOW ABOUT I GET
THE FRANCAISE, THIS ONE?

33:35.625 --> 33:37.208
IT HAS THAT MUSHROOMS
AND ZUCCHINI.

33:37.250 --> 33:39.041
I LIKE ZUCCHINI.

33:39.083 --> 33:40.959
I'D SAY IT WENT
PRETTY WELL.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.917
YOU MEAN ONCE I KEPT
MY MOUTH SHUT.

33:42.959 --> 33:44.875
WELL, SHE PROMISED TO PLAY NICE,
BUT YOU KNOW HOW MOTHERS ARE.

33:44.917 --> 33:46.792
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT HER.
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU.

33:46.834 --> 33:48.166
YOU CUT ME OFF.

33:48.208 --> 33:49.583
I STOPPED HER FROM ASKING YOU

33:49.625 --> 33:51.041
ABOUT THINGS
WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED YET.

33:51.083 --> 33:52.208
IT WAS LIKE YOU DIDN'T THINK

33:52.250 --> 33:53.875
THAT I HAD IDEAS
ABOUT MY OWN LIFE.

33:53.917 --> 33:55.583
OR YOU DIDN'T TRUST ME
TO TALK TO YOUR MOTHER.

33:55.625 --> 33:57.041
I'M SORRY IF THAT'S
THE WAY IT CAME ACROSS.

33:57.083 --> 33:58.375
IT'S JUST MY MOTHER
I DON'T TRUST.

33:58.417 --> 34:00.709
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WILL NOT
BE TREATED LIKE A LITTLE CHILD

34:00.750 --> 34:02.458
WHO NEEDS TO BE SILENCED,
ALL RIGHT?

34:02.500 --> 34:04.250
THIS IS NOT WORKING.

34:04.291 --> 34:06.834
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

34:06.875 --> 34:08.208
WAIT. ARE YOU BREAKING UP
WITH ME?

34:08.250 --> 34:10.000
YOU NEED TO GO.

34:10.041 --> 34:12.000
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. WE'RE
JUST HAVING AN ARGUMENT HERE.

34:12.041 --> 34:13.041
GO.

34:13.083 --> 34:14.166
NO.

34:14.208 --> 34:15.709
FINE.

34:17.625 --> 34:18.834
AMELIA.

34:18.875 --> 34:20.875
(door closes)

34:20.917 --> 34:23.875
(indistinct conversations)

34:23.917 --> 34:26.917
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

34:32.333 --> 34:34.041
(lowered voice)
ARE YOU AWAKE?

34:34.083 --> 34:36.458
(scoffs) I'M AWAKE.

34:36.500 --> 34:39.041
I MIGHT BE HALLUCINATING,
BUT I'M AWAKE.

34:39.083 --> 34:40.417
I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU.

34:40.458 --> 34:41.875
I'VE BEEN LAYING HERE
FOR WEEKS.

34:41.917 --> 34:44.041
EVERYTHING'S A BOTHER.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.667
YOU LOOK LIKE
DEATH WARMED OVER.

34:45.709 --> 34:47.583
(normal voice)
THANKS, HEIDI KLUM.

34:47.625 --> 34:49.000
MM. I GOT A HEADACHE

34:49.041 --> 34:51.000
THAT WOULD PUT GODZILLA
IN A FETAL POSITION.

34:51.041 --> 34:53.959
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S NOON
OR A QUARTER TO MIDNIGHT

34:54.000 --> 34:57.458
OR, WELL, 1976.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.083
IT'S 2:00 A.M.

34:59.125 --> 35:00.417
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

35:00.458 --> 35:02.041
I COULDN'T FALL ASLEEP
IN THE ON-CALL ROOM.

35:02.083 --> 35:03.083
YOU ON CALL?

35:03.125 --> 35:04.875
NO. I...

35:04.917 --> 35:06.709
(exhales)

35:06.750 --> 35:08.417
JAMES AND I HAD A FIGHT.

35:08.458 --> 35:10.417
HE'S STILL AT MY APARTMENT,

35:10.458 --> 35:12.041
WHICH, IN AN ACT
OF SHEER FREAKIN' BRILLIANCE,

35:12.083 --> 35:13.291
I STORMED OUT OF.

35:13.333 --> 35:14.709
(chuckles)

35:14.750 --> 35:16.041
WHO STORMS OUT
OF THEIR OWN APARTMENT?

35:16.083 --> 35:18.083
UGH. I'M SO EMBARRASSED.

35:18.125 --> 35:21.041
I MEAN, I-I WAS JUST TRYING
TO STAND UP FOR MYSELF,

35:21.083 --> 35:22.417
AND NOW...

35:22.458 --> 35:24.417
OH, GOD.
I'M SO HUMILIATED.

35:24.458 --> 35:26.166
I CAN'T GO BACK.

35:26.208 --> 35:29.000
I JUST--I WANTED...

35:29.041 --> 35:30.709
(exhales)

35:30.750 --> 35:32.542
I JUST NEED TO SIT
WITH SOMEONE.

35:32.583 --> 35:35.041
SIT.

35:54.125 --> 35:55.333
(camera shutter clicks)

36:05.083 --> 36:06.166
HEY.
HEY.

36:06.208 --> 36:07.375
LATE NIGHT WITH JAMES?

36:07.417 --> 36:09.041
MM. SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.000
SO IT'S GOING WELL?

36:11.041 --> 36:13.000
THINGS ARE FINE.

36:13.041 --> 36:14.166
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING

36:14.208 --> 36:15.792
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME?

36:15.834 --> 36:18.041
WHY DON'T YOU GET THE FEELING
THAT I DON'T WANT TO TALK?

36:18.083 --> 36:20.125
I DON'T NEED A SHRINK.

36:20.166 --> 36:22.291
I DIDN'T NEED
A MATCHMAKER EITHER,

36:22.333 --> 36:25.125
BUT THAT DID NOT STOP YOU
FROM SHOVING DATES IN MY FACE

36:25.166 --> 36:27.000
IN SOME QUEST FOR TRUE LOVE

36:27.041 --> 36:30.041
THAT I DID NOT EVEN REMOTELY
HINT AT BEING INTERESTED IN.

36:32.417 --> 36:34.417
JUST LET IT GO.

36:35.875 --> 36:37.542
SORRY.

36:37.583 --> 36:38.750
(sets cup down)

36:38.792 --> 36:40.041
OH.

36:40.083 --> 36:42.583
NO. UH...

36:42.625 --> 36:45.041
I'M SORRY.

36:45.083 --> 36:46.542
I DIDN'T GET
MUCH SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

36:46.583 --> 36:48.166
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

36:48.208 --> 36:49.625
YOU ARE RIGHT.

36:49.667 --> 36:52.041
I'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME
ON MY COUCH ALONE, TOO.

36:52.083 --> 36:53.250
(chuckles)

36:53.291 --> 36:55.000
AND THE THING IS...

36:56.250 --> 36:59.250
I'M NOT A YOUNG WOMAN.

36:59.291 --> 37:03.041
I MEAN, I KNOW,
I STILL GOT IT, BUT...

37:03.083 --> 37:05.458
I'M NOT YOUNG.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.041
SO SOMETIMES I THINK

37:08.083 --> 37:10.041
MAYBE...

37:10.083 --> 37:14.041
I WILL SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE ALONE.

37:14.083 --> 37:17.250
(cell phone buzzes)

37:19.333 --> 37:22.208
I HAVE TO GO THE HOSPITAL.

37:27.083 --> 37:30.875
VIOLET, YOU CAN CALL ME.

37:30.917 --> 37:35.333
WE CAN HANG OUT IN THE COUCH
IN SWEATS TOGETHER.

37:41.875 --> 37:43.750
(indistinct conversations)

37:43.792 --> 37:45.500
I GOT THE PAGE.

37:45.542 --> 37:46.709
WHAT HAPPENED?

37:46.750 --> 37:48.041
ANOTHER SEIZURE.

37:48.083 --> 37:50.041
I KNOW. I'M TAKING HER FOR
A C.T. TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED.

37:50.083 --> 37:51.959
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THE LESIONS WERE GONE.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.041
THEY WERE.

37:53.083 --> 37:55.083
WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT,
KAYE. WE WILL.

37:55.125 --> 37:57.500
PLEASE. I CAN'T...
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

37:57.542 --> 37:59.041
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

37:59.083 --> 38:01.834
GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.
I WAS WORRIED.

38:01.875 --> 38:04.792
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

38:10.083 --> 38:12.000
(knocks)

38:12.041 --> 38:14.000
YOU OKAY?

38:15.583 --> 38:17.583
DO I DESERVE SOMEONE?

38:17.625 --> 38:18.792
AMELIA, OF COURSE.

38:18.834 --> 38:20.333
I MEAN, WHY--
WHY DO YOU--

38:20.375 --> 38:23.500
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
IF JAMES AND I CAN'T WORK

38:23.542 --> 38:26.375
OR IF DON'T WANT US TO.

38:26.417 --> 38:29.083
I MEAN, AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I'M A RECOVERING ADDICT

38:29.125 --> 38:31.041
WITH A DUMP TRUCK
FULL OF BAGGAGE, RIGHT?

38:31.083 --> 38:33.458
AND THE WORST TRAGEDY
THAT HAS EVER STRUCK JAMES

38:33.500 --> 38:35.750
IS HAVING TO PUT DOWN
HIS GOLDEN RETRIEVER.

38:35.792 --> 38:37.333
YOU'RE NOT GIVING HIM
ANY CREDIT.

I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE SEEING THE POINT.

38:59.625 --> 39:02.250
YOU'VE BEEN SO STRONG
THIS PAST YEAR.

39:02.291 --> 39:03.792

IN MY MIND

39:03.834 --> 39:05.166
THAT IF YOU WANTED TO
WORK THROUGH THIS, YOU COULD.

39:05.208 --> 39:07.000

THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS?

39:22.834 --> 39:26.041

I'M GONNA BE FINE.

39:33.917 --> 39:36.041

39:36.083 --> 39:39.792

WHO'LL HOLD MY HAND.
