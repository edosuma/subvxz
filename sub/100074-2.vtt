WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:01.840
- Previously
on "God Friended Me"...

00:01.840 --> 00:02.960
- The God Account sent Joy

00:02.960 --> 00:04.520
the Friend Suggestion,
not you.

00:04.520 --> 00:06.120
- I have a daughter.

00:06.120 --> 00:08.160
I gave her up for adoption.

00:08.160 --> 00:09.320
- If you're writing a book
about Simon Hayes,

00:09.320 --> 00:10.720
we have nothing to talk about.

00:10.720 --> 00:11.840
He ruined my life.

00:11.840 --> 00:12.880
- And because of me,
she's never worked

00:12.880 --> 00:14.120
as a journalist again.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.480
- So I'm moving to Paris, then.

00:15.480 --> 00:16.520
- Cara what I'm trying to say--

00:16.520 --> 00:17.640
- Please don't say it.

00:17.640 --> 00:18.720
I won't be able
to get on that plane.

00:18.720 --> 00:19.840
Simon, I don't think
I'm here

00:19.840 --> 00:21.280
just to write your book.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.800
I think the God Account wants
me here for something bigger.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.520
- "Follow the Lady.
Find your Path."

00:25.520 --> 00:27.040
- I don't think the God Account
is done with you just yet.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.240
- ♪ Where do I, I belong ♪

00:37.240 --> 00:39.320
- "Follow the Lady.
Find your Path."

00:39.320 --> 00:41.320
That's right, the
"Millennial Prophet" is back

00:41.320 --> 00:43.800
with a brand-new mystery.

00:43.800 --> 00:47.800
New episodes dropping
only on FreeVerse.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.120
Right on time.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.640
- Well, as a girlfriend,
I am nothing if not punctual.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.280
What are you up to?
- Uh, actually,

00:56.280 --> 00:59.640
I am recording new promos
for the "Millennial Prophet."

00:59.640 --> 01:01.080
You're never
gonna believe this.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.800
The God Account finally
reached out to me.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.280
It left a message
on my Facebook wall.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.160
- Well, that's great.
What did it say?

01:08.160 --> 01:10.480
- "Follow the Lady.
Find your Path."

01:10.480 --> 01:13.200
- Specific yet cryptic.
Classic God Account.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.320
But you're actually not the
only one with God Account news.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.200
- What do you mean?
- So do you remember

01:18.200 --> 01:19.600
that Facebook message I got

01:19.600 --> 01:21.080
from my friend Annie
five years ago?

01:21.080 --> 01:23.240
- The one that said your mother
was in New York.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.480
- So it turns out,
she never sent that.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.480
Her Facebook account
was hacked.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.120
I think it was the God Account.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.000
- That would mean
that the God Account

01:31.000 --> 01:34.200
was around five years ago.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.840
Cara, are you sure about this?

01:35.840 --> 01:37.120
- I have Simon looking
into the hacked message,

01:37.120 --> 01:38.640
see if we can confirm it.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.280
- Let me know
what you find out.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.920
- Okay, I'll call you tonight.
- Okay.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.920
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.680
- How's the move coming?
- Very slowly.

01:48.680 --> 01:51.480
- Do you need any help?
- That would be great.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.000
You want to come by
after Sunday service?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.040
- Sure.
- Oh, speaking of

01:55.040 --> 01:56.480
Sunday Service,
I've been asked

01:56.480 --> 02:00.400
to speak at First Advent
of Harlem next week.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.240
- But First Advent's
an LGBTQ church.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.800
- Yeah, I was hoping
to pick your brain

02:05.800 --> 02:08.040
on issues important
to the LGBTQ community.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.680
- Dad, when it comes
to the church,

02:09.680 --> 02:11.680
I mean, you're definitely
progressive.

02:11.680 --> 02:14.480
But First Advent,
it's nondenominational.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.920
I mean, they embrace everyone,
no questions asked.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.280
They're beyond progressive.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.800
- As far as I'm concerned,
a church full of people

02:20.800 --> 02:22.800
is a church full of people.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.240
I thought
you'd be more excited.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.840
I mean, that's why
I came down here.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.120
- You came down here
to ask me what issues

02:28.120 --> 02:29.520
might be important
to the people

02:29.520 --> 02:30.480
who might attend First Advent.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.480
- And what's wrong with that?

02:32.480 --> 02:34.640
- Don't you think
someone who speaks there

02:34.640 --> 02:37.480
should already know
what's important to them?

02:37.480 --> 02:39.240
Look, Dad, I know you miss

02:39.240 --> 02:40.840
being up on that
pulpit on Sundays,

02:40.840 --> 02:44.240
but I want to make sure
that's not what this is.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.920
- Uh-huh.

02:46.920 --> 02:51.200
- So I ran a deep web search
for "Find the Lady"

02:51.200 --> 02:52.680
and "Follow your Path"...
- Mm-hmm.

02:52.680 --> 02:55.600
- As well as the dark web,
just in case.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.120
Nothing.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.520
Man, you know, in the year
we've been doing this,

03:00.520 --> 03:03.800
it just never seems
to want to make things easy.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.320
- Actually, Cara thinks
that the God Account

03:07.320 --> 03:09.280
sent her a message
five years ago.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.520
- Saying what?

03:10.520 --> 03:12.120
- That her mother
was in New York.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.000
That's why Cara moved here.
- Wow.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.280
If that's true, I don't know

03:17.280 --> 03:19.880
what else the God Account's
been up to or for how long.

03:19.880 --> 03:21.720
Um, is she sure
it was the God Account

03:21.720 --> 03:23.080
that sent the message?

03:23.080 --> 03:24.480
- Yeah, well, she has Simon
doing some digging,

03:24.480 --> 03:25.840
seeing what he can find.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.680
But, I mean,
she seems pretty excited

03:27.680 --> 03:31.200
to have the God Account mystery
in Paris.

03:31.200 --> 03:35.120
- Okay, uh, I am extrapolating
from this goofy smile of yours

03:35.120 --> 03:36.720
that you guys are doing good.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.480
- Yeah.
- You finally

03:38.480 --> 03:39.520
tell her you love her?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.680
- We know how we feel.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.480
I don't need to say anything.
- Man, but you want to.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.600
- I'm in New York, okay.
She's in Paris.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.480
Can we just concentrate
on figuring out

03:48.480 --> 03:50.640
who the Lady is,
whoever she may be?

03:50.640 --> 03:52.720
- Yeah, okay.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.880
- Hey.

04:01.880 --> 04:02.920
What?

04:11.480 --> 04:14.520
- Wow, that's quite a story.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.680
So what do you think

04:15.680 --> 04:17.480
the God Account
wants you to do?

04:17.480 --> 04:21.520
- No idea, but finding you
probably wasn't by chance.

04:21.520 --> 04:24.640
And the fact that you and Simon
have the history you do,

04:24.640 --> 04:25.880
it's the kind of thing
the God Account

04:25.880 --> 04:26.880
would want me to help with.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.800
- You were right.
The God Account

04:32.800 --> 04:34.920
hacked Annie's Facebook
and sent you that message.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.280
- Are you sure?
- I'll spare you

04:36.280 --> 04:38.240
the technical jargon, but yeah,
and there's more.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.000
Oh.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.560
Oh, wow.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.920
This is awkward.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.600
- Okay, wait.
Annie, please.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.080
Please wait.
Just one second.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.840
Okay, you said there was more.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.800
- Uh, yeah.

04:55.800 --> 05:00.520
Um, for some reason,
it was really easy

05:00.520 --> 05:02.920
to trace the hack to Annie's
Facebook account, right?

05:02.920 --> 05:06.680
Like the God Account
wanted us to know.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.920
So I ran a traffic log

05:08.920 --> 05:11.560
to the ISP server
that it used

05:11.560 --> 05:15.080
and it pinged three locations
all across the city.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.920
- So it sent us these locations
five years ago?

05:17.920 --> 05:20.520
- No.
It pinged them yesterday.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.640
- What do you think it is?

05:22.640 --> 05:25.720
- Could be a map.
- Or a path.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.680
"Follow the Lady.
Find your Path."

05:28.680 --> 05:30.680
- I'm sorry,
are you speaking code?

05:30.680 --> 05:32.840
- Sorry, um,

05:32.840 --> 05:36.000
the God Account, it sent
this message to Miles yesterday

05:36.000 --> 05:37.480
right before we got
these locations.

05:37.480 --> 05:38.640
- Hmm.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.680
- I mean, the timing
can't be a coincidence.

05:40.680 --> 05:41.680
- So you think
this is about Miles?

05:41.680 --> 05:43.240
- Yeah.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.120
Look, I'm gonna need
your help, Annie.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.520
- You're the best

05:46.520 --> 05:48.640
investigative journalist
that I know.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.080
Come on, we've never
worked a story together.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.600
Please?

05:55.680 --> 05:57.480
Where's the first location?

06:01.320 --> 06:04.640
- Let me get this straight.
You think I might be the Lady?

06:04.640 --> 06:06.320
- I don't know.
It's possible.

06:06.320 --> 06:08.240
That's what
we're gonna find out.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.920
- I mean, it makes sense.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.560
Like, the God Account waited
until you two were together

06:12.560 --> 06:14.520
before sending Joy her first
Friend Suggestion, right?

06:14.520 --> 06:17.480
- Mm-hmm.
- And once you set aside

06:17.480 --> 06:19.920
your differences and learned
how to work together,

06:19.920 --> 06:22.480
Miles got a new message.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.120
- So, what, am I just supposed
to let Miles

06:24.120 --> 06:26.440
follow me around
like a lost puppy or something?

06:28.600 --> 06:30.080
- I'm guessing
we'll get another clue

06:30.080 --> 06:31.520
once we help our next
Friend Suggestion.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.040
- Which would be now.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.200
Teddy Preston.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.040
He's some sort
of self-help guy.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.480
- You know,
it's sad that people

06:41.480 --> 06:43.040
actually buy into this stuff.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.600
- Desperate.
- Says two people

06:44.600 --> 06:46.440
taking orders
from an Internet deity.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.920
- So how are we
gonna talk to him?

06:50.920 --> 06:54.640
- Looks like we're in luck.
Teddy's giving a seminar today.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.720
"Hack Your Life:
Reprogramming Who You Are

06:56.720 --> 06:57.800
To Get What You Want."

06:57.800 --> 06:59.680
That's kind of cool.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.320
- Shall we?
- Oh.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.560
- ♪ You ready? ♪

07:05.560 --> 07:07.320
♪ I said you ready? ♪

07:07.320 --> 07:09.280
- Hey, do you really think
helping this guy

07:09.280 --> 07:11.520
is going to lead us
to finding out my path?

07:11.520 --> 07:13.800
- I don't know,
but helping a self-help guy,

07:13.800 --> 07:15.600
that's...

07:15.600 --> 07:18.480
How can you not appreciate
the irony, right?

07:18.480 --> 07:22.120
- Okay, registration packet,
life check questionnaire,

07:22.120 --> 07:23.680
seminar badges.
- All right.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.800
- And I enrolled us
in their e-raffle.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.560
- Ooh.
- So fingers crossed.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.680
Oh, and you each owe me
75 bucks.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.520
- Who?

07:33.520 --> 07:37.640
- Please welcome to the stage
Teddy Preston.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.520
- Yeah! Whoo!

07:39.520 --> 07:41.480
Yes!
I can feel the energy.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.480
Thank you guys for coming.
Thank you.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.600
Thank you so much.
You can have a seat.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.000
Thank you.
I like that energy.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.840
Now, 15 years ago,
I had nothing.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.400
I knew what I wanted
out of life,

07:54.400 --> 07:59.040
but like so many people, I let
fear and insecurity control me.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.400
Our brains, they're just like
any other hard drive.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.680
But instead of wires,
we have neural pathways.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.920
I needed to reprogram
my pathways.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.520
I needed to hack my life.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.200
That's why you're here today.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.400
You're ready to break through.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.200
We're gonna have
a great day today.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.080
I promise you,
if you follow me,

08:23.080 --> 08:24.840
at the end of the day,

08:24.840 --> 08:28.640
you will find your path!

08:36.000 --> 08:36.920
- This includes
the morning session.

08:36.920 --> 08:38.200
Ted will return after lunch.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.720
- Dude, did you hear
what he just said?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.400
We're gonna figure out
your message.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.040
- Yeah. Yeah, man.
I think you're right.

08:43.040 --> 08:46.640
- Excuse me, we're here to help
Teddy Preston, remember?

08:46.640 --> 08:47.640
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.680
I mean, after.
After we help Teddy,

08:49.680 --> 08:51.120
we can look into the message.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.400
- So how do we talk to him?

08:53.400 --> 08:55.920
- I don't know.
- Wait here.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.560
- She's gonna steal
the VIP badges, isn't she?

09:05.320 --> 09:06.640
Yeah.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.840
Okay.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.240
- Really?
- What?

09:13.240 --> 09:15.840
The seminar doesn't start
until after lunch.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.520
We'll talk to Teddy,
find out what his problem is,

09:17.520 --> 09:18.800
and then return the badges
before they're missed.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.560
- That's not the point, okay?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.120
I think we should
look into Teddy,

09:22.120 --> 09:23.640
figure out what his problem
might be

09:23.640 --> 09:25.520
before we go charging backstage
to talk to him.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.720
- Why look into Teddy
when we can just

09:27.720 --> 09:29.640
find him and talk to him?

09:29.640 --> 09:32.080
- Okay, I have been doing this
for a very long time--

09:32.080 --> 09:35.000
- Yes, and now it's my turn.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.320
Look, I don't mind
your help, Miles.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.640
But if I'm gonna do this,
I need to do it my way.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.880
Okay?

09:44.880 --> 09:47.120
- Okay.
- Good.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.040
- Thanks for meeting with me.

09:50.040 --> 09:51.840
I wanted to talk with you
to make sure

09:51.840 --> 09:56.280
that I'm the right person
to address your parishioners.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.280
- You mind if I ask where
this hesitation's coming from?

09:58.280 --> 09:59.640
- Well, from a conversation

09:59.640 --> 10:01.680
with my daughter, Ali,
actually.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.520
- That surprises me.
- I'm sorry?

10:04.520 --> 10:05.680
- I don't know Ali
all that well,

10:05.680 --> 10:07.480
but she seems like
an amazing young woman.

10:07.480 --> 10:11.680
- Uh, I'm confused.
How do you know my daughter?

10:11.680 --> 10:13.080
- She's been taking
our new membership classes

10:13.080 --> 10:14.720
for the last few weeks.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.280
I thought you knew.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.240
- So, uh, how are we supposed
to find Teddy?

10:30.240 --> 10:31.480
- Well, there's got to be
a greenroom

10:31.480 --> 10:33.600
or a VIP area around here.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.560
- Welcome, VIPs.
- I'll just ask someone.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.280
- Kathy McDonald.
Are you here

10:37.280 --> 10:38.640
for your five-minute
coaching session with Teddy?

10:38.640 --> 10:41.080
- Absolutely.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.600
- Sorry if things seem
a little bit chaotic in here.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.920
Today's seminar
is being filmed.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.080
- What's the special occasion?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.400
- Some of the biggest names
in media and publishing

10:48.400 --> 10:49.600
are here to see Teddy.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.640
It is a once-in-a-career
opportunity.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.240
- And how long
have you worked for him?

10:53.240 --> 10:54.840
- I took his seminar
three years ago

10:54.840 --> 10:56.920
and never looked back.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.480
- Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.120
I can't wait for you
to get the book.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.520
Really appreciate
you coming out.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.080
Thank you.
- That was great.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.040
- These guests are here for
their five-minute Speed Hacks.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.240
- Oh, Teddy Preston.
Have a seat.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.680
Let's talk.

11:11.680 --> 11:14.240
- All right,
this is the first location.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.320
- So that's all
the message said was,

11:16.320 --> 11:17.720
"Follow the Lady.
Find your Path"?

11:17.720 --> 11:20.200
- That's it.
- And you think this could be

11:20.200 --> 11:21.520
why the God Account
wants you in Paris,

11:21.520 --> 11:22.880
to help Miles figure it out?

11:22.880 --> 11:25.480
- It's possible, yeah.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.880
- Well, I certainly think
it's a better use of your time

11:27.880 --> 11:29.600
than writing fiction
about Simon Hayes

11:29.600 --> 11:31.040
wanting to change the world.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.920
- Technically,
it's nonfiction.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.320
- More like science fiction.
- Okay, guys.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.400
Can we just focus, please?

11:37.400 --> 11:39.880
We need to figure out
why we're here.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.560
- Well, I certainly hope
it's not to buy art.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.800
I mean, I got to say,
the God Account's taste

11:45.800 --> 11:47.320
is a little pedestrian,
don't you think?

11:47.320 --> 11:49.480
I mean, seashells?
Really?

11:49.480 --> 11:52.680
- Wait.

11:52.680 --> 11:56.480
Seashells, sunflowers,
and spiral galaxies.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.240
These are all forms
of the golden ratio.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.280
- Fibonacci.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.640
Let me find out
who the photographer is.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.640
- Okay, so Fibonacci
was this mathematician

12:06.640 --> 12:08.480
from, like, 700 years ago
that the God Account

12:08.480 --> 12:09.920
sort of has a thing for.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.680
Last year, it led Miles
and I to--

12:11.680 --> 12:12.720
- Fliss and Beaker.

12:12.720 --> 12:13.920
I read a few
of your articles last night.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.600
They're good.
- Thank you.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.680
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hmm?

12:17.680 --> 12:19.680
- Why would you give
all that up and move to Paris

12:19.680 --> 12:23.000
to write a book about
the creation of an algorithm?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.640
- Look, I know
you don't like Simon,

12:24.640 --> 12:27.880
but what he's trying to do
is an amazing story.

12:27.880 --> 12:32.520
- Maybe, but it's not
your story.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.040
- Paul Grenelle.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.400
That's the name
of the photographer.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.280
But he passed away
a few years ago.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.800
- Grenelle.
At the gallery that I work at,

12:39.800 --> 12:41.640
we displayed his photos
a few times.

12:41.640 --> 12:42.840
- Really?
- Yeah, he was sort of

12:42.840 --> 12:44.520
a local fixture.

12:44.520 --> 12:45.880
He used to photograph
one of my favorite parks,

12:45.880 --> 12:47.640
Le Champ de Mars.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.560
- Hmm, well,
that's interesting,

12:50.560 --> 12:53.000
because the Champ de Mars is
the next location on the map.

12:56.040 --> 13:00.480
- Kathy told us that this was
a pretty important day for you.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.800
- Are you nervous
about anything going wrong?

13:01.800 --> 13:04.520
- "Nervous" is just
another word for fear.

13:04.520 --> 13:08.640
So think of our deepest fears
like a virus in our software.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.880
- Hmm, which is why
we have to run

13:10.880 --> 13:12.640
a full diagnostic
of our life patterns

13:12.640 --> 13:14.480
to find out where
they're hiding?

13:14.480 --> 13:16.240
- Somebody gets it.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.560
It's all about
reprogramming ourselves

13:18.560 --> 13:20.680
so we stop making the same
mistakes over and over.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.840
- Teddy?
- Oh.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.000
Unfortunately,
our time is up.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
But you guys have a great
afternoon, all right?

13:30.800 --> 13:33.200
- Uh, Mr. Preston.
One more question.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.200
It's pretty important.
- Yeah, what is it?

13:35.200 --> 13:39.080
- Onstage, you said,
"Find your path."

13:39.080 --> 13:40.320
What did you mean?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.800
- Uh, that's just
an expression.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.120
A way to talk about
our individual journeys.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.600
- Young man,
you can't be in here.

13:47.600 --> 13:51.600
- Mr. Preston, um,
my name is Jacob Abbott.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.000
Do you know who I am?
-  Should I?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.720
- My mother was Karen Abbott.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.680
You dated her 15 years ago.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.040
I'm your son.

14:06.080 --> 14:09.040
- I'm sorry, I've never heard
of Karen Abbott,

14:09.040 --> 14:10.560
and I certainly
don't have a son.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.240
- Wait, Joy!
Joy, wait.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.120
- Jacob, hey.
Excuse me.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.640
- What?
You guys are with Teddy?

14:28.640 --> 14:31.560
- We are.
We just want to talk to you.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.320
We want to see if you're okay.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.080
- My father just told me
I don't exist.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.040
So no, I'm not okay.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.560
- Is there anything
that we can do?

14:38.560 --> 14:40.920
- No.
- Do you mind if I ask you?

14:40.920 --> 14:43.000
How do you know
Teddy's your father?

14:43.000 --> 14:46.480
- My mom told me
a few weeks ago.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.840
Right before she died.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.560
She and Teddy used to date.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.480
They broke up before my mom
knew she was pregnant.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.400
She decided to raise me
on her own,

14:55.400 --> 14:57.320
not tell him about me.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.640
When she finally told me,
I thought maybe something good

14:59.640 --> 15:01.280
might come from losing her.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.840
I guess I was wrong.

15:07.240 --> 15:11.320
You can tell him from me,
I won't ever contact him again.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.120
- Yo, where's Teddy?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.200
- Oh, he cleared backstage
and went to the bar.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.480
- Makes sense.
The man just found out

15:22.480 --> 15:24.040
that he had a son.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.240
I'm guessing he could use
a drink right about now.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.280
Bar's this way.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.880
- See what you can find out
about Teddy and Karen Abbott.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.880
- Yeah.

15:31.880 --> 15:34.320
- Okay, let's just ease
into this, okay?

15:34.320 --> 15:36.200
- Yeah, absolutely.

15:36.200 --> 15:39.200
He's your son, isn't he?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.680
Excuse me,

15:40.680 --> 15:41.800
how is this
any of your business?

15:41.800 --> 15:44.040
- Look, we spoke to Jacob
after he left,

15:44.040 --> 15:48.200
and, believe it or not,
we just want to help.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.440
- I don't need any help.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.960
And I don't know
who that kid was,

15:51.960 --> 15:53.200
but he was obviously lied to.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.040
- No, he wasn't.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.280
And from the looks
of your double vodka,

15:56.280 --> 15:59.400
you already know that.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.640
You knew Jacob's mother, Karen,
didn't you?

16:04.240 --> 16:05.920
- Did you know
that she passed away?

16:09.080 --> 16:11.800
- She's dead?
- Yeah.

16:11.800 --> 16:15.080
And before she died,
she told Jacob about you.

16:15.080 --> 16:20.240
She wanted her son--your son--
to know about his father.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.440
Now, look, I know this is
a lot to take in,

16:23.440 --> 16:25.800
but your son needs you
right now.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
- It's not that simple.
- He's your child.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.920
He just wants to know you.
It is that simple.

16:33.920 --> 16:37.640
- You don't understand.
- Then explain it to me.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.640
- Jacob's grandfather
would never allow it.

16:39.640 --> 16:42.720
- Why not?

16:42.720 --> 16:45.200
- Look, it doesn't matter.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.280
It's better this way.
I have to go.

16:49.640 --> 16:50.880
- We need to talk
to the grandfather,

16:50.880 --> 16:52.200
figure out
what his problem is.

16:52.200 --> 16:55.120
- Hey, we don't get
extra credit for speed, Joy.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.720
This is not a race.

16:56.720 --> 16:59.240
- What's the harm in talking
to the grandfather?

16:59.240 --> 17:02.240
- The harm is, we could end up
making things worse.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.320
- Right now,
Teddy has no intention

17:04.320 --> 17:06.680
of having a relationship
with his son.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.440
How can we make that worse?

17:10.720 --> 17:13.400
What?
- You told me

17:13.400 --> 17:15.640
about when you gave your
daughter up for adoption,

17:15.640 --> 17:18.440
about you moving to New York.
I just want to make sure

17:18.440 --> 17:20.800
that everything that
we're doing is about Teddy.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.640
- It is.

17:31.640 --> 17:34.120
- I mean, we've walked
almost the entire park.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.400
What do you think
the God Account

17:35.400 --> 17:36.640
wants us to see here?

17:36.640 --> 17:38.600
- I have no idea.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.680
- This park is one of my
favorite places in Paris.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.240
I used to come here a lot
after you went home.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.640
- Yeah, you never did tell me

17:45.640 --> 17:48.080
why you decided
to stay in Paris.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.800
- Well, after I realized
the full extent

17:50.800 --> 17:53.720
that Simon inflicted
on my reputation,

17:53.720 --> 17:55.640
I didn't really want to go home
and face the fact

17:55.640 --> 17:57.840
that I was never gonna be
a journalist again.

18:03.920 --> 18:07.000
Hey, Annie, um...

18:07.000 --> 18:10.520
for what it's worth,
I am sorry.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.600
- That's not worth much,
unfortunately.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.880
After you destroyed
my career,

18:15.880 --> 18:17.880
I used to come here
and sit on these benches

18:17.880 --> 18:20.960
and wonder what I would say to
you if I ever got the chance.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.400
- Mm-hmm.
- It all boiled down

18:22.400 --> 18:25.280
to one simple question.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.640
- Okay.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.960
What do you got?
Let's have it.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.080
- Guys, look.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.240
- What is it?

18:41.240 --> 18:44.000
- Uh,
"The Little Red Lighthouse."

18:44.000 --> 18:46.680
It was my favorite book
growing up.

18:46.680 --> 18:50.480
Miles actually got me
a first edition last year.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.040
- Oh, uh...

18:55.040 --> 18:55.920
- Merci.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.200
- I don't get it.
Why does the God Account

19:03.200 --> 19:04.880
want to show me
"The Little Red Lighthouse"?

19:04.880 --> 19:06.320
- Well, you said
it was important to you.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.840
- Yeah, but what does it have
to do with helping Miles?

19:10.880 --> 19:13.200
- Maybe it doesn't.
- Maybe it's not about Miles.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.080
Maybe this is about you.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.240
- My doorman said that
you're friends of Teddy's.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.720
- Yes, I'm Miles Finer.
This is Joy Chen.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.880
- Jacob told me what happened.

19:29.880 --> 19:33.480
I warned him
what kind of man Teddy is.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.040
He's better off without him.
- That's not your decision.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.400
If Mr. Preston wants to file
a petition for custody,

19:38.400 --> 19:39.880
that's within his rights.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.920
- So you're his lawyer.
- That's right.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.120
- Look, we just
want to understand.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.040
If Teddy wants to know
his son,

19:47.040 --> 19:47.880
shouldn't he have
that opportunity?

19:47.880 --> 19:49.400
- He did.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.080
Teddy didn't even acknowledge
who he was.

19:51.080 --> 19:54.080
Karen told him
she was pregnant.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.240
It's the reason he ran away,
and that's the reason

19:55.240 --> 19:56.880
he'll never have a relationship
with Jacob

19:56.880 --> 19:58.920
as long as I'm alive.

20:03.420 --> 20:07.100
- Whoa, twice in one day.
You want some lunch?

20:07.100 --> 20:10.700
- No, um...

20:10.700 --> 20:12.380
I wanted to talk to you
about First Advent.

20:22.540 --> 20:26.540
I was a little thrown that you
didn't want me to speak.

20:26.540 --> 20:29.180
- Um, it's not that I didn't.
I just...

20:29.180 --> 20:31.380
I wanted to make sure you were
doing it for the right reasons.

20:33.580 --> 20:36.540
- For the right reasons?
You sure about that?

20:36.540 --> 20:39.580
After we spoke, I decided
to talk to Pastor Olivia,

20:39.580 --> 20:42.980
and she said you're taking
membership classes.

20:46.420 --> 20:50.220
- After you stepped down
at Harlem Episcopal, I--

20:50.220 --> 20:52.100
I wanted to explore my options.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.180
- What are you talking about?
Harlem Episcopal is our home.

20:55.180 --> 20:56.540
It's where you were baptized,

20:56.540 --> 20:57.540
where you took
your first communion,

20:57.540 --> 20:58.980
were confirmed.

20:58.980 --> 21:00.620
- I know that.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.820
- I don't understand
you turning your back

21:02.820 --> 21:04.980
on a community
that helped raise you.

21:04.980 --> 21:07.380
- That is not
my community, Dad!

21:09.620 --> 21:11.620
- Then that's it, then, hmm?

21:13.500 --> 21:16.940
You are becoming a member
of First Advent.

21:16.940 --> 21:18.740
- Yes.

21:30.180 --> 21:32.540
- You two again?
You need to leave right now,

21:32.540 --> 21:34.100
or I'm gonna have security
escort you out of here.

21:34.100 --> 21:35.980
- You knew.

21:35.980 --> 21:37.780
You knew you were gonna be
a father, and you walked away.

21:40.740 --> 21:43.620
- Look, I don't--I don't know
who you think you are,

21:43.620 --> 21:45.300
but this is none
of your business.

21:45.300 --> 21:46.820
- You have the chance
to make this right.

21:46.820 --> 21:50.460
How can you walk away
from your child a second time?

21:50.460 --> 21:52.420
- You don't understand.
- The hell I don't!

21:54.300 --> 21:56.820
No matter what happened
15 years ago,

21:56.820 --> 22:00.700
all that matters now
is that he wants to know you.

22:04.780 --> 22:07.420
- There you are.

22:07.420 --> 22:09.180
I just talked to the hotel.

22:09.180 --> 22:10.980
We're being shut down.

22:10.980 --> 22:12.580
- What are you talking about?

22:12.580 --> 22:14.460
- Something about
a fire marshal inspection

22:14.460 --> 22:16.100
and needing a capacity waiver.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.140
It took us a year to get
the big publishing houses

22:18.140 --> 22:19.700
to agree to come today.
- Okay, I just--

22:19.700 --> 22:20.980
I need two minutes.

22:20.980 --> 22:22.380
Can you give me
two minutes, please?

22:22.380 --> 22:23.300
I'll meet you outside.
- Yeah.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.740
- Thank you.
- Okay.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.700
How did you find out
that I knew about Jacob?

22:36.700 --> 22:39.540
- Um, we spoke to James Abbott.

22:39.540 --> 22:41.980
- And said what, exactly?

22:41.980 --> 22:44.820
- That he couldn't restrict
Jacob from seeing you.

22:48.740 --> 22:51.100
I told you he would
never allow that.

22:51.100 --> 22:53.940
- Wait.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.540
Do you think he's the reason
why you're being shut down?

22:59.100 --> 23:00.540
He warned me that if I ever

23:00.540 --> 23:01.900
tried to have
a relationship with Jacob,

23:01.900 --> 23:03.380
he would do everything
in his power to ruin me.

23:03.380 --> 23:04.700
Which, thanks to you,

23:04.700 --> 23:07.460
is exactly
what he's about to do.

23:15.800 --> 23:19.080
- I know we've hit
a bit of a setback,

23:19.080 --> 23:20.880
but I'm not sure
day drinking's the answer.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.520
- I told you this could happen.

23:22.520 --> 23:23.920
- This exact scenario?

23:23.920 --> 23:25.800
I think I would
remember that.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.640
- Not only are Teddy and Jacob
still estranged,

23:27.640 --> 23:30.960
but because of us, James Abbott
torpedoed his career.

23:30.960 --> 23:33.000
- That's your problem, Miles.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.640
You are so worried
about not making things worse

23:36.640 --> 23:38.800
that you can't see what
it takes to make them better.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.200
Whatever is going on between

23:40.200 --> 23:42.080
Teddy and James Abbott,
it runs deep,

23:42.080 --> 23:44.120
which means there isn't
going to be an easy fix.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.400
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:46.400 --> 23:51.240
Joy, this is my sister, Ali.
Ali, this is Joy.

23:51.240 --> 23:52.720
Please don't let
the name fool you.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.240
- Okay, hi.
It's nice to meet you.

23:55.240 --> 23:58.400
I've heard a lot about you.
- Same.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.040
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

24:00.040 --> 24:01.600
- Yeah.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.680
Can you give us a minute?

24:10.320 --> 24:12.480
- Something happened
between me and Dad,

24:12.480 --> 24:16.040
and I don't know
how to fix it.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.880
- I am sure that whatever
you guys are going through,

24:17.880 --> 24:19.960
you'll be able
to work it out.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.520
- I'm leaving Harlem Episcopal

24:21.520 --> 24:23.920
and joining
First Advent of Harlem.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.400
He thinks it's about

24:25.400 --> 24:27.680
First Advent
being an LGBTQ church.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.680
- It's not?
- No.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.200
When I came out, there were
people at Harlem Episcopal,

24:32.200 --> 24:35.240
I mean, people who
I thought were my friends

24:35.240 --> 24:37.880
who left the church
because of me.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.040
- I know.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.800
- You do?

24:40.800 --> 24:42.320
- Dad told me a year ago,

24:42.320 --> 24:44.080
but he said that
you didn't know.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.040
- How could I not?

24:46.040 --> 24:47.960
And then from that moment on,
it just--

24:47.960 --> 24:49.200
it never felt like home.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.520
- Then you have to tell him.

24:51.520 --> 24:52.880
If you don't, then he's not

24:52.880 --> 24:55.280
gonna understand
why you're leaving.

24:55.280 --> 24:58.040
- It won't change anything.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.960
All it would do
is hurt his feelings.

25:02.520 --> 25:08.040
There is a ceremony today at
First Advent for new members.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.080
Could you come down
and be there with me?

25:10.080 --> 25:12.040
- Of course.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.320
- Thank you.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.480
- Hey, hey, Rakesh.
What's up?

25:18.480 --> 25:20.880
- Miles, I've got some news.
- Okay, hold on.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.040
- After you told me
about James Abbott

25:23.040 --> 25:25.080
shutting down Teddy's seminar,
I did some digging,

25:25.080 --> 25:27.320
and I found something that
might explain what's going on.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.400
- Okay, we're listening.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.520
- 15 years ago, James Abbott

25:31.520 --> 25:34.920
wrote Teddy a check
for $50,000.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.920
- He paid Teddy to walk away
from his pregnant daughter.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.480
- And Teddy took the money.

25:42.480 --> 25:45.200
- Yep.
- Okay.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.840
Thanks, Rakesh.
- You got it.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.000
- All right,
we have to talk to Teddy.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.440
What?
- Teddy would rather

25:53.440 --> 25:55.000
give up his relationship
with his son

25:55.000 --> 25:56.920
than have him find out
the truth, trust me.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.200
- I think we can
change his mind together.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.000
- I understand,
but is there somebody

26:03.000 --> 26:07.400
from the city's permit office
that I can speak to, please?

26:07.400 --> 26:11.040
Thank you!
You've been so unhelpful.

26:14.420 --> 26:18.740
Well, whatever James did
to shut me down,

26:18.740 --> 26:20.780
I can't fight it.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.620
He's won.
- No, no, no, no.

26:22.620 --> 26:25.700
He hasn't.
Not yet.

26:25.700 --> 26:29.220
But he will unless
you tell Jacob the truth.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.700
Look, we know about the money

26:30.700 --> 26:33.380
that James paid you
to walk away.

26:52.380 --> 26:55.500
It was actually
never about the money.

26:55.500 --> 26:58.020
Telling myself
I could be bought

26:58.020 --> 27:03.140
was just easier to live with
than admitting the truth.

27:03.140 --> 27:04.700
- Which was what?

27:06.220 --> 27:07.420
- That he was scared.

27:09.180 --> 27:13.620
Scared of being a father,
scared of giving up his life,

27:13.620 --> 27:15.540
his future to raise a child,

27:15.540 --> 27:17.620
scared that even
if he had stayed,

27:17.620 --> 27:20.100
he would end up
resenting his life

27:20.100 --> 27:22.580
no matter how much
he loved his son.

27:30.100 --> 27:33.420
- Well, it's not too late.

27:33.420 --> 27:35.420
You can still make this right.

27:47.140 --> 27:49.380
- What the hell do you think
you're doing here?

27:49.380 --> 27:51.420
- I'm here to talk to Jacob.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.420
- No, that's never
gonna happen.

27:53.420 --> 27:55.460
- He has every right
to speak to his son.

27:55.460 --> 27:57.020
And if Jacob wants
a relationship,

27:57.020 --> 27:58.380
it's gonna happen
at some point.

27:58.380 --> 28:00.220
- That's right.
Can't stop him.

28:00.220 --> 28:03.900
- I don't need to.
You haven't changed, Teddy.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.380
A man who is willing
to walk away

28:05.380 --> 28:07.700
from the woman he loves
and his unborn child

28:07.700 --> 28:11.460
for money doesn't change.

28:11.460 --> 28:14.580
Go ahead, Jacob is in his room
right down the hall.

28:14.580 --> 28:16.540
Tell him.

28:16.540 --> 28:18.540
Look your son
straight in the eyes

28:18.540 --> 28:20.140
and tell him
who you really are,

28:20.140 --> 28:21.740
what you did.

28:21.740 --> 28:24.940
But just to make sure
we're clear moving forward,

28:24.940 --> 28:27.420
you leave here right now
and promise not to come back,

28:27.420 --> 28:30.380
and your little event
at the hotel is back on.

28:30.380 --> 28:32.460
I shut it down
with a phone call.

28:32.460 --> 28:35.380
Another call can fix it.
- Don't listen to him.

28:35.380 --> 28:39.100
- Walk away, and I'll give you
back the life you really want

28:39.100 --> 28:40.740
and everyone can go back

28:40.740 --> 28:43.780
to believing the lie
that's Teddy Preston.

28:43.780 --> 28:45.940
- You can tell Jacob the truth.

28:45.940 --> 28:48.940
You can have a relationship
with your son.

28:52.020 --> 28:54.620
- No, he's right.

28:56.580 --> 28:58.380
Jacob's better off without me.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.640
- Okay, okay, I'm sure Teddy's
heading back to his seminar.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.680
It is not too late.
We just need to figure out

29:10.680 --> 29:12.640
a way to convince him
to tell Jacob the truth.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.240
- You don't get it.
No one is going to be able

29:14.240 --> 29:16.000
to convince him of that,
least of all you.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.920
- Well, we have
to do something.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.520
- Yeah, we do.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.280
- Hey, wait.
Where are you going?

29:22.280 --> 29:25.600
- Only way to fix this
is to take a risk.

29:25.600 --> 29:28.920
I need you to trust me, Miles.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.080
- This is the last location.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.240
If we're supposed
to find something,

29:35.240 --> 29:38.040
it's got to be here.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.400
- Pardon, we're not open yet.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.280
- Uh, do you mind
if we just look around?

29:42.280 --> 29:44.960
- Of course.
- Merci.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.960
- So how's your day?
- Ha.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.080
I'll be happy when this is over

29:53.080 --> 29:54.680
and we can go
our separate ways.

29:54.680 --> 29:56.600
- I still owe you an answer
to your question

29:56.600 --> 29:58.720
you wanted to ask me
if you ever

29:58.720 --> 30:02.040
came face-to-face
with me again.

30:02.040 --> 30:05.240
- Yeah, I wanted to know
what it feels like

30:05.240 --> 30:07.600
not to care about anything
or anyone but yourself.

30:07.600 --> 30:08.720
I want to know what it's like

30:08.720 --> 30:10.000
to go through
your life like that.

30:12.040 --> 30:15.040
- It's lonely.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.720
- I'd imagine.

30:18.520 --> 30:22.960
- Well, there's nothing here.
- Well, let's keep looking.

30:22.960 --> 30:23.880
Maybe you'll
recognize something.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.480
- Like what?

30:27.040 --> 30:29.680
- ♪ When the moon
hits your eye ♪

30:29.680 --> 30:31.720
♪ Like a big pizza pie,
that's amore ♪

30:31.720 --> 30:34.120
- This song.
- "That's Amore."

30:34.120 --> 30:36.440
What about it?

30:36.440 --> 30:37.880
- It was the song
that was playing

30:37.880 --> 30:40.080
when Miles and I
had our first kiss.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.040
It was the whole reason
we had a first kiss

30:42.040 --> 30:44.080
in an Italian restaurant.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.880
- Well, I know you thought
this was about helping Miles,

30:45.880 --> 30:47.480
but maybe it is
about both of you,

30:47.480 --> 30:48.880
about your relationship.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.040
- No, no, I mean,
Miles and I are good.

30:51.040 --> 30:53.080
- I never said you weren't.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.920
- It's just a song.
This is ridiculous.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.400
- Maybe this is
the God Account's way

30:57.400 --> 30:59.040
of telling you that
you shouldn't have left

30:59.040 --> 31:00.400
or that you should go back.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.200
- No, no, I can't.
- Why?

31:07.840 --> 31:11.120
Before I left...

31:11.120 --> 31:13.480
Miles was gonna tell me
that he loved me.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.640
But I told him not to,
that if he did,

31:15.640 --> 31:18.040
I would say it back
and I wouldn't leave.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.720
But I lied.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.680
Because I couldn't
tell him the truth.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.640
- You don't love Miles?

31:29.480 --> 31:32.440
I've never felt this way
about anyone before.

31:32.440 --> 31:36.040
Not even close.

31:36.040 --> 31:38.440
But for some reason, I--

31:38.440 --> 31:39.680
I can't tell him that,
and I don't know why.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.480
So I got on a plane,

31:42.480 --> 31:45.280
and I gave myself
six months to figure it out.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.720
- Hey, it's okay
not to be ready.

31:47.720 --> 31:50.200
You just have to tell Miles
how you feel.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.680
- I don't need to say anything.

31:51.680 --> 31:52.600
- Maybe that's what
the God Account's

31:52.600 --> 31:53.720
trying to tell you.

31:53.720 --> 31:55.400
- Okay, well, if it is,
then it's wrong.

31:55.400 --> 31:57.120
Because Miles is in New York
and I'm here,

31:57.120 --> 32:00.680
so I don't need
to face anything.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.360
All right, look, I'm sorry.

32:06.840 --> 32:09.440
- Dude, the seminar's
gonna start any minute.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.880
Where's Joy?
- I have no idea.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.120
She said that she was
gonna come and fix this,

32:13.120 --> 32:14.360
but she didn't say how.

32:14.360 --> 32:15.320
- Please take your seats.

32:15.320 --> 32:18.040
The seminar's about to begin.

32:20.080 --> 32:21.920
- Where have you been?

32:21.920 --> 32:24.320
- Teddy doesn't think
he deserves a relationship

32:24.320 --> 32:27.000
with his son
because of what he did.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.440
There's only one person

32:28.440 --> 32:29.600
that could ever
convince him otherwise.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.720
- Jacob.
- In order for that to happen,

32:31.720 --> 32:33.240
he had to know the truth.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.840
- That was Teddy's choice,
not yours.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.920
- I'm sorry,
you told Jacob

32:39.920 --> 32:42.280
that his own father took money
to leave before he was born?

32:42.280 --> 32:43.800
- Yes, he's on his way
over here

32:43.800 --> 32:44.840
right now
to confront him about it.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.440
- To confront him?
What is that gonna do?

32:46.440 --> 32:47.800
How is that gonna
make things better?

32:47.800 --> 32:49.280
What if he never talks
to him again?

32:49.280 --> 32:51.600
- He will, but this needs
to come first.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.440
It's the only way.
I told you, Miles.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.320
You just need to trust me.

32:58.440 --> 33:01.640
Jacob.

33:01.640 --> 33:04.480
Oh...

33:04.480 --> 33:06.040
- Excuse me, can I have
everyone's attention, please?

33:06.040 --> 33:08.080
- No, no, no, Joy,
what is he doing?

33:08.080 --> 33:11.440
- My name is Jacob Abbott,
and I'm Teddy Preston's son.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.280
- What the hell's going on?
What is he doing up there?

33:13.280 --> 33:15.280
- He told me that he wanted
to come and talk to you.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.600
I assumed it would be
in private,

33:16.600 --> 33:18.320
but I guess he has other plans.

33:18.320 --> 33:20.280
- I came here today
to share with you

33:20.280 --> 33:23.040
the kind of man he really is.

33:23.040 --> 33:25.480
He talks about how
he started out with nothing,

33:25.480 --> 33:28.280
a self-made man
who overcame the odds.

33:28.280 --> 33:32.040
But the truth is,
he started out with $50,000,

33:32.040 --> 33:34.520
a check that my grandfather
wrote to him

33:34.520 --> 33:38.360
to walk away from my mother
and me before I was born.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.480
This is the man who you've
come to listen to today

33:40.480 --> 33:43.280
who you think has the answers
to life's tough questions.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.640
He doesn't!

33:44.640 --> 33:48.480
He's a man you should want
nothing to do with!

33:48.480 --> 33:51.480
I know I sure as hell don't.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.400
- It's gonna be fine.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.000
You can still fix this.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.440
You just need to get up there,

33:59.440 --> 34:01.440
tell them that you
invited Jacob here,

34:01.440 --> 34:02.600
that this is all
part of your program

34:02.600 --> 34:05.480
of helping people
face their fears.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.520
You can fix this!

34:12.360 --> 34:14.920
- I hope so.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.480
Hey, Jacob.
Hey, Jacob.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.920
Please, just give me a minute.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.120
Jacob, one minute, please,

34:25.120 --> 34:27.800
and I promise I'll never
bother you again.

34:27.800 --> 34:30.440
Jacob, please.
You're right, okay?

34:32.640 --> 34:35.880
Everything you said onstage,
you're right about all of it.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.840
Except one thing.

34:37.840 --> 34:42.280
Not a day goes by where I don't
think about that moment.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.720
I shouldn't have
taken the money, but I did.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.720
- You left.

34:49.720 --> 34:52.680
- I know. I know.

34:52.680 --> 34:56.880
Look, if you want nothing to do
with me, I don't blame you.

34:56.880 --> 34:59.280
We don't know each other.

34:59.280 --> 35:01.280
We don't have anything
in common.

35:01.280 --> 35:05.320
But, Jacob, if you just
give me a chance,

35:05.320 --> 35:08.600
I will spend the next
15 years of my life

35:08.600 --> 35:10.880
proving to you
that it was worth it,

35:10.880 --> 35:14.080
that this moment right now

35:14.080 --> 35:16.680
is the best one of my life.

35:16.680 --> 35:20.320
Because this is the day where
I finally got to meet my son

35:20.320 --> 35:23.840
and tell him how sorry
I was for everything

35:23.840 --> 35:26.480
and that I was never
leaving again.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.320
- Did you love her?

35:35.480 --> 35:37.440
My mom?

35:39.680 --> 35:41.480
- More than anything.

35:46.040 --> 35:47.280
- Well, I guess
we have that in common.

35:47.280 --> 35:49.040
- Yeah?

35:52.320 --> 35:55.480
- I need some time.
Is that okay?

35:55.480 --> 35:58.280
- Yeah.
I'll wait.

35:58.280 --> 36:01.520
However long it takes,
Jacob, I will wait.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.280
- Are you okay?

36:17.280 --> 36:19.000
- I don't know.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.400
I think, for the first time
in a long time, I might be.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.280
Jacob said that
he needs more time.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.280
Which, after what
just happened,

36:26.280 --> 36:27.720
I should have plenty of.

36:27.720 --> 36:31.520
- Hmm.
- Sorry about that.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.520
- Well, I guess
it's a small price to pay

36:33.520 --> 36:36.280
to be able to have
a relationship with my son.

36:36.280 --> 36:39.240
Thank you.
All of you.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.400
- So how did you know
telling Jacob

36:48.400 --> 36:50.640
was the thing that would
bring them together?

36:52.640 --> 36:55.600
- When I gave up my daughter,

36:55.600 --> 36:59.440
the one stipulation I had was
that it was a closed adoption.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.520
- Why?

37:01.520 --> 37:04.440
- To make sure
she could never find me,

37:04.440 --> 37:07.080
never be able to ask
why I gave her up,

37:07.080 --> 37:11.520
why I didn't
love her enough to keep her.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.720
I knew I didn't have an answer
that was good enough

37:13.720 --> 37:15.480
for either of us.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.440
Teddy thought that he
deserved his guilt,

37:20.440 --> 37:23.280
and I knew there was
only one person

37:23.280 --> 37:25.280
who could tell him
that he doesn't.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.440
- That's good advice.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.320
- Well, I have to be at work
in a few hours,

37:39.320 --> 37:42.440
so I will see you guys later?

37:42.440 --> 37:45.680
- And, Joy, um...

37:45.680 --> 37:48.480
you were right.

37:48.480 --> 37:51.640
Maybe sometimes
you have to take a risk.

37:58.480 --> 38:01.440
- Still think she's the Lady?
- I don't know.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.600
- Hmm.
What's our next move?

38:03.600 --> 38:05.720
- Honestly, I thought
you were right.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.360
That after helping Teddy,

38:07.360 --> 38:08.440
we would figure out
the message.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.400
- Hmm.

38:13.280 --> 38:15.680
God Account?

38:15.680 --> 38:18.320
- No, it's an alert
from Teddy Preston's seminar

38:18.320 --> 38:20.440
informing me that
I just won two tickets

38:20.440 --> 38:22.200
to visit the Statue of Liberty

38:22.200 --> 38:24.080
courtesy of
Lady Liberty Cruises.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.320
- Lady Liberty!
- Yeah.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.720
Lady.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.840
Follow the Lady.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.360
- Let's go.
- Wait, I have to make

38:34.360 --> 38:35.600
a call to my dad.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.440
There's something
he needs to know.

38:48.040 --> 38:50.240
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.440
- What are you doing here?
Where's Miles?

38:55.440 --> 38:59.280
- Your brother called me
and told me I needed

38:59.280 --> 39:01.280
to come down here
for your welcoming ceremony

39:01.280 --> 39:02.440
for new members.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.280
- And what else
did he tell you?

39:04.280 --> 39:05.840
- That you know what happened
at Harlem Episcopal

39:05.840 --> 39:09.920
when you came out.

39:09.920 --> 39:13.200
- I'm sorry.
I told Miles not to tell you.

39:13.200 --> 39:16.840
- Well, he said
telling me was a risk

39:16.840 --> 39:18.840
but that it was one
he needed to take

39:18.840 --> 39:20.280
to make sure
that we were okay.

39:27.880 --> 39:30.840
You wanted to leave
Harlem Episcopal all this time?

39:30.840 --> 39:32.920
- Yes.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.600
- But you stayed
because of me.

39:36.840 --> 39:40.880
Harlem Episcopal has changed.
I made sure of it.

39:40.880 --> 39:43.080
- Did you come down here
to tell me that?

39:43.080 --> 39:44.400
- No.

39:44.400 --> 39:47.480
No, I came down here
because I was so wrapped up

39:47.480 --> 39:49.640
in what Harlem Episcopal
means to me,

39:49.640 --> 39:52.120
I never once asked

39:52.120 --> 39:53.680
what it means to you.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.120
- I know this is tough.
- Mm-hmm.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.320
- But me leaving
Harlem Episcopal

40:01.320 --> 40:03.280
does not mean
that I'm leaving you.

40:05.200 --> 40:08.320
I know.

40:08.320 --> 40:14.640
Um, you mind if I stay and get
to know your new community?

40:14.640 --> 40:15.840
- I'd love that.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.440
- Man, I can't believe this.

40:24.440 --> 40:26.040
Hey, what do you think
we're gonna find?

40:28.280 --> 40:31.520
- No idea.
- You don't sound very excited.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.440
- It's just--I wish Cara
was here for this.

40:34.440 --> 40:36.440
- That's why you wish
Cara was here?

40:36.440 --> 40:39.480
To help us solve the next
God Account clue, really?

40:39.480 --> 40:41.280
How romantic.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.520
- Look, man,
it's not just that. It's--

40:43.520 --> 40:45.600
Look, even if I did figure
it out, I can't imagine

40:45.600 --> 40:49.080
going on this new journey
without her by my side.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.280
- Hey, Cara.

40:58.280 --> 41:00.480
You always walk this fast?

41:00.480 --> 41:01.680
It's Paris, you know?

41:01.680 --> 41:03.000
Take in the sights
a little bit.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.480
- Yeah, sorry I took off.
- It's all right.

41:05.480 --> 41:08.440
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

41:08.440 --> 41:11.880
So what are you
doing here, Simon?

41:11.880 --> 41:13.720
- You know, you said to me
the God Account

41:13.720 --> 41:16.640
doesn't do anything
for no reason, right?

41:16.640 --> 41:18.440
- Yeah, but
the God Account knows

41:18.440 --> 41:20.440
that I'm not ready to tell
Miles that I love him.

41:20.440 --> 41:24.080
Nothing's changed, so why point
to all this stuff today?

41:24.080 --> 41:26.040
I mean, how does this
help Miles find his path?

41:26.040 --> 41:27.800
- I don't know.

41:27.800 --> 41:31.320
But hey, you--you do realize
we're standing on

41:31.320 --> 41:34.120
the Pont de Grenelle, right?

41:34.120 --> 41:36.720
And Grenelle was the last name
of the photographer

41:36.720 --> 41:40.480
at the Fibonacci exhibition
this afternoon at the gallery.

41:40.480 --> 41:42.680
I don't know,
maybe your answers

41:42.680 --> 41:44.600
are waiting for you
here on the bridge.

41:44.600 --> 41:47.440
What do you think?
- It's doubtful.

41:47.440 --> 41:49.040
But thanks.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.680
- Okay.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.680
Hey.

42:12.680 --> 42:15.040
I was just thinking about you.
- You too.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.480
It's Cara.

42:16.480 --> 42:18.680
- Any luck on figuring out
who the Lady is?

42:18.680 --> 42:20.280
-  I thought
that the God Account

42:20.280 --> 42:22.000
was pointing me
to the Statue of Liberty,

42:22.000 --> 42:23.320
but it's a dead end.

42:23.320 --> 42:26.040
It's weird.

42:26.040 --> 42:29.400
It felt right, you know?

42:29.400 --> 42:31.200
Just wish I knew
what I was missing.

42:31.200 --> 42:33.880
- Wait, Miles,
I think you were right

42:33.880 --> 42:35.480
about the Lady being
the Statue of Liberty.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.920
You're just at the wrong one.

42:36.920 --> 42:38.440
- Wait, what are you
talking about?

42:38.440 --> 42:40.040
- There's
a Statue of Liberty here.

42:40.040 --> 42:42.040
That's what the God Account
was trying to tell me.

42:42.040 --> 42:45.120
Miles, you need
to come to Paris.

42:45.120 --> 42:47.480
- Cara, that has to be it.

42:47.480 --> 42:49.200
I'm coming to Paris.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
- Greg, move your head.
