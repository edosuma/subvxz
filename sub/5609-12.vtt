Once Upon A Time...

00:03.253 --> 00:05.414
What must I do to enact this curse?

00:05.506 --> 00:08.748
You need to sacrifice the heart
of the thing you love most.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.835
I'm sorry.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.003
(YELLS)

00:11.094 --> 00:12.300
EMMA: This isn't fair to Killian.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.464
Gold tricked him. I'm getting him back.

00:13.597 --> 00:15.633

-The UndenNorld.

-Hey, Emma.
-(GASPS)

00:43.460 --> 00:44.449
Neal?

00:45.462 --> 00:48.829
Yeah. It's really great to see you.

00:48.966 --> 00:50.456
Where are we? Am I dreaming?

00:50.509 --> 00:51.840
No.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.215
If this were a dream, there'd be like

00:53.303 --> 00:56.010
talking donuts
or something weird like that.

01:01.478 --> 01:05.642
Think of this as a long-distance call
from an old friend.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.973
It's really you.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.851
How's our son?

01:12.739 --> 01:16.323
Great. He misses his dad.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.110
-He's growing up.
-I bet.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.663
Yeah, I know that's where you're
heading. That's kind of why I'm here.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.164
Don't go, Emma.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.674
Once you get there,
it is not an easy place to get out of.

01:38.015 --> 01:41.678
I know you're trying to save Hook,
but trust me on this.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.260
This won't end the way you think it will.

01:44.354 --> 01:48.063
I would've come after you, too.
I didn't know I could do this.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.226
You couldn't have.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.611
I'm not there. I'm not in limbo.

01:53.697 --> 01:57.406
What does that mean?
That Hook is there?

01:57.534 --> 01:58.694
I can get him?

01:58.785 --> 01:59.945
Yeah, he's there.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.780
Then help me.

02:02.789 --> 02:06.031
I can split my heart and give it to him.
It could work.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.246
The UndenNorld is for people
with unfinished business.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.040
And that isn't me.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.872
That's why I'm not there.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.420
Where are you?

02:17.554 --> 02:18.589
Someplace.

Stop what you're doing
before it's too late.

02:30.817 --> 02:31.897
I can't.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.608

03:00.013 --> 03:01.093
Because we're here.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.458
I don't think we're in Maine anymore.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.183
EMMA: How is this possible?

03:54.776 --> 03:57.813
How does the UndenNorld
look like Storybrooke?

03:57.904 --> 04:00.316
GOLD: Your questions are pointless.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.023
All that matters is that all these people
in this UndenNorld

04:03.118 --> 04:04.153

13:07.829 --> 13:09.694
I know.

13:15.878 --> 13:19.211
But I do have unfinished business.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.376

and get out of here.

You need to leave now.

And if you won't,
I will see to it that you do.

for a boat to take you home.

You must.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.728
to put aside all suspicion
after how I raised you.

14:20.860 --> 14:26.071
But, Regina, do you remember
the last thing I said to you

14:27.241 --> 14:28.447

Sometimes a mother has to do
what's best for her child,

14:52.600 --> 14:54.761
even if it's reprehensible.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.722
Are you threatening me?

14:56.813 --> 14:59.725
Oh, no, no, of course not. I'd never.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.392
But there's something
I have to show you.

15:29.303 --> 15:32.466

15:32.723 --> 15:34.179
(SCREAMING)

15:42.191 --> 15:44.352
You... You killed him.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.855
"Killed" is a relative term down here.

15:50.533 --> 15:54.867
This UndenNorld,
most can only leave it in two ways.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.366
To a better place or a worse one.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.867
But you, my sweet daughter,
have another option.

16:02.837 --> 16:07.501
However, not for long.
Go home or there will be a cost.

16:08.342 --> 16:11.209
Someone will suffer.

16:12.847 --> 16:13.882
Who?

16:14.640 --> 16:15.629
Your father.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.093
I'll only be gone for a day.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.591
Just long enough to retrieve Hook.

16:59.769 --> 17:02.476
I don't understand. Why you?

17:02.605 --> 17:05.392
Because, Belle,
I'm the only one who's been there.

Oh, come on, son. Don't be like that.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.504
Aren't you glad to see
your dear old father?

18:12.633 --> 18:17.844
Just because you, uh, sired me,
that doesn't make you my father.

18:18.389 --> 18:19.674
Step aside.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.012
Keep looking for as long as you like.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.308
But down here, this is my shop.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.861

18:36.699 --> 18:39.657
Maybe it's time to put
the past behind us.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.033
This is what you're looking for, right?

18:45.875 --> 18:48.366
Go on. Take it.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.996
How generous.
How many strings are attached?

18:53.049 --> 18:54.209
No strings.

18:54.258 --> 18:57.921
Rumple, I meant what I said
before I died.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.385
I do want to start over.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.890
Never gonna happen.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.881
I sent you here for a reason.

19:04.018 --> 19:07.351
I miss the world above.
The tastes, the smells...

19:07.396 --> 19:09.603
Sorry. You can't go back.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.597
Not unless I trade places
with a living soul.

19:12.860 --> 19:16.227
And those people you came down with,
they are not your friends.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.857
And they are living for now.

19:21.911 --> 19:26.245
Maybe one of them
doesn't make the trip back.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.080
But your dear old dad does.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.246
-Not interested.
-Not yet.

19:32.963 --> 19:36.922
But this one's on the house for today.

19:36.967 --> 19:42.087
A gesture of goodwill
from a father to his son.

19:51.273 --> 19:55.437
She'll really do that? She'll throw
your father, her husband, into the fire?

19:55.569 --> 19:58.902
Of course she will. She thinks
she's giving me my best chance.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.402
I can't let my father suffer
because of me.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.487
-Regina, it's all right.
-No, it's not.

20:05.079 --> 20:07.616
He's here because I killed him.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.284
The only way I've been able
to deal with that

20:09.417 --> 20:11.123
is by imagining
he went to a better place.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.453
But he didn't.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.294
(SlGHS) Maybe I should get
on that boat.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.172
-Yes, you should.
-DAV|D: Absolutely not.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.461
We're not leaving
until we find Hook together.

20:20.511 --> 20:21.671
lt's dangerous here.

20:21.804 --> 20:24.420
Which is why
we're not leaving you alone.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.465
Perhaps I can cut through
this little family squabble.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.636
What the hell is that?

20:28.769 --> 20:31.806
This is the way to find
your deceased pirate.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.815
The Ale of Seonaidh
from the land of DunBroch.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.522
That's a mouthful.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.645
It lets you communicate with the dead.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.646
Pour this over Hook's grave,

20:42.700 --> 20:45.658
and we can stop guessing where he is
and simply ask him.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.489
You're saying Hook has a grave here
in the UndenNorld?

20:47.621 --> 20:49.486
Everyone down here has a grave.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.660
You'll find the cemetery
right where you remember it.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.701
If this works, we could find Hook
before the boat leaves.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.122
We can all get out of here together.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.333
A fine idea.
I suggest you all get moving.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.832
No way. You're coming with us.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.840
You can do this part on your own.

21:04.972 --> 21:08.681
There's a boat that's leaving soon.
You want to find Hook? Fine.

21:08.809 --> 21:12.347
But I have no interest in exploring
this world further.

21:13.314 --> 21:16.522
You can meet me there,
but that's entirely up to you.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.191
Emma, there's no time to argue.

21:19.236 --> 21:23.855
If there's even a chance that will work,
we have to risk it.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.330
I got your message. Are you alone?

21:33.375 --> 21:35.536
Alone and unarmed, as promised.

21:35.586 --> 21:38.669
Why, I'm alone
but I don't go anywhere unarmed. Sorry.

21:38.714 --> 21:42.753
I'm here because
I care about my daughter.

21:43.177 --> 21:47.546

it will destroy the kingdom,

30:33.457 --> 30:35.413
Your mother is using me

30:35.500 --> 30:38.867
to get you to leave,
but I want you to stay.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.293
You've got a job to do.

30:40.422 --> 30:42.663
Helping Snow White, your friends.

30:42.758 --> 30:45.090
They need you.
They need your strength.

30:46.261 --> 30:49.674
You finally put vengeance aside
to be a hero.

30:50.557 --> 30:53.014
I'm not going to stand in the way of that.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.434
But Mother is going to send you
someplace worse.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.559
l... I can't cause you pain again.

31:00.650 --> 31:04.518
Mother made her decision. We both
know we can't change her mind.

31:04.613 --> 31:07.696
But she's given you a way out.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.114
Both of us.

31:09.951 --> 31:14.160
When you tore my heart out,
it was driven by the worst motives.

31:14.247 --> 31:15.532
But if you stay,

31:15.665 --> 31:18.372
you spread hope.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.451
That's the best thing anyone can do.

31:21.129 --> 31:23.620
Let your old man see you
doing the right thing.

31:25.759 --> 31:29.422
Then I truly will not have died in vain.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.520
CORA: Where's your father run off to?

31:44.611 --> 31:47.944
I still owe him a thank you
for spoiling your birthday surprise.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.570
I've already dealt with him.

31:57.374 --> 31:59.035
Say hello to Daddy.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.163
(GASPS) Oh!

32:03.964 --> 32:05.500
You've impressed me, sweetheart.

32:08.802 --> 32:12.795
You know, Daddy may have been
wrong to ruin my revenge,

32:13.974 --> 32:15.214
but he was right about you.

32:15.308 --> 32:19.642
When are you going to get it in that
thick head that I do everything for you?

32:19.729 --> 32:23.313
Especially the things you can't do,
like Snow's heart.

32:24.359 --> 32:25.474
How long have you
been trying to get it?

32:25.569 --> 32:27.309
Because it only took me a day.

32:27.404 --> 32:30.771
And it only took you an hour to lose it.

32:30.866 --> 32:35.781
When I get my revenge,
it will be my victory.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.699
You won't be around to steal it away.

32:38.832 --> 32:41.289
You don't have the power
to push me back to Wonderland.

32:41.418 --> 32:43.454
I don't need it.

32:43.545 --> 32:46.628
There's someone
who'd be happy to lend a hand.

32:46.756 --> 32:50.123
Hello again, Cora. Ready for your trip?

32:50.719 --> 32:51.708
(STRAINING)

32:53.096 --> 32:54.256
Don't do this.

32:54.347 --> 32:55.723
It's done.

32:55.807 --> 32:59.470
I've already cast a spell
to seal this portal once you're through.

32:59.561 --> 33:03.474
Not even I can re-open it,
and you'll be out of my life forever.

33:03.565 --> 33:06.227
Without me, you'll fail,
and even worse, you'll be alone.

33:06.359 --> 33:07.735
Better alone than with you.

33:07.819 --> 33:11.562
You think you're better alone?
Let's see how you really feel.

33:12.866 --> 33:13.855
(GASPS)

33:14.242 --> 33:15.231
Oh!

33:15.660 --> 33:18.618
No! Daddy!

33:20.749 --> 33:22.114
(GRUNHNG)

33:26.713 --> 33:29.170
Well, you always have me.

33:44.147 --> 33:45.262
Let him go, Mother.

33:46.816 --> 33:47.942
You should be on that boat.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.017
I can't turn my back on those I love.

33:51.071 --> 33:56.236
I know that seems like the right choice,
but life doesn't work that way.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.859
I implore you, leave this place.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.491
No, Regina. Stay here.
Help your friends.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.957
She's trying to bait you.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.578
I didn't come back
just to help my friends.

34:05.669 --> 34:07.455
I came back to help everyone.

34:07.546 --> 34:10.253
CORA: That's not possible.

34:10.340 --> 34:11.580
You have to trust me.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.381
Let him go.

34:13.468 --> 34:15.550
Oh, please listen to reason.
Listen to me.

34:15.637 --> 34:19.550
Either way,
my time in the UndenNorld is done.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.844
Yours can be, too. Just do what I say.

34:21.935 --> 34:23.175
Henry, stand back.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.177
Please don't force my hand.
I don't want to do this.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.305
Then don't.

34:28.441 --> 34:29.726
I'm sorry.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.062
No!

34:39.995 --> 34:41.576
One day you'll understand.

34:43.915 --> 34:47.703
(CRYlNG) Daddy, I'm so sorry.

34:51.006 --> 34:52.121
Daddy?

34:52.215 --> 34:55.252
Stop! Stay there. I'm okay.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.431
What's happening?

35:03.518 --> 35:05.554
I don't know.

35:07.564 --> 35:11.022
There's something down here.

35:12.652 --> 35:14.188
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

35:17.407 --> 35:20.899
It's so... It's beautiful.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.364
It's where I belong.

35:32.589 --> 35:34.875
I know what
my unfinished business was now.

35:36.593 --> 35:37.628
It was you.

35:38.386 --> 35:39.546
Me?

35:39.638 --> 35:44.678
For so long, I let your mother
get in the way of who you really are.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.888
It was the biggest regret of my life.

35:49.064 --> 35:52.556
But now you're free of her,

35:53.610 --> 35:56.477
and I've never been more proud.

35:57.030 --> 35:58.019
(SOBS)

35:58.448 --> 36:00.109
HENRY: Hi.

36:01.785 --> 36:02.865
Is that...

36:02.994 --> 36:06.657
This is your grandson. Henry.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.366
(GASPS)

36:09.209 --> 36:14.329
Thank you, Grandpa,
for believing in her. Like I do.

36:15.882 --> 36:20.046
Thank you, Henry,
for being there when I couldn't.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.844
You take good care of her.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.349
It's time for me to go.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.438
Daddy, no.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.767
I love you, Regina.

36:37.821 --> 36:42.110
Never forget who you really are.

37:20.613 --> 37:21.693
Tell me your father's okay.

37:22.407 --> 37:23.863
He's better than okay.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.486
HENRY: He's in a better place now.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.317
MARY: Wait, that means
everyone here...

37:27.454 --> 37:28.534
Can be saved.

37:28.955 --> 37:31.867
Every soul in this town has
unfinished business.

37:32.792 --> 37:36.626
And chances are for a lot of them,
we're that business.

37:36.713 --> 37:39.796
You've all deluded yourselves if you
think these people are worth your time.

37:40.675 --> 37:45.590
They're not the dearly departed.
They are dead, wretched souls.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.965
And I want no part of it.

37:47.056 --> 37:48.637
What you want doesn't matter.

37:48.725 --> 37:52.434
I wasn't bluffing, I'm happy to tell Belle
about your return to Dark One-ness.

37:53.271 --> 37:57.230
Our agreement was to find your pirate
and get the hell out of here.

38:01.529 --> 38:03.815
be my guest. I'm out.

38:12.916 --> 38:17.330
So who is ready for Operation Firebird?

38:17.420 --> 38:19.376
(CHUCKLES) Is that what
we're calling it?

38:19.464 --> 38:21.750
You referring to the mythological bird,
or the muscle car?

(CLOCK TICKS)

39:45.425 --> 39:47.040
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

39:50.179 --> 39:51.555
HADES: Mmm.

39:55.977 --> 39:58.389
Did you hear that, Cora?

39:59.480 --> 40:01.061
The music?

40:01.816 --> 40:06.025
Yes, but I've never been
very fond of the violin.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.397
HADES: Mmm-hmm.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.316
I wouldn't expect a miller's daughter

40:09.407 --> 40:13.241
to appreciate a virtuoso like Paganini,

40:13.328 --> 40:15.159
but no, I didn't mean the music.

40:15.204 --> 40:17.365
l was talking about the clock.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.533
Did you hear that little tick up there?

40:22.837 --> 40:26.921
It was the sound of your incompetence.

40:27.008 --> 40:32.173
Why do you want my daughter gone?
What threat could she pose to you?

40:32.597 --> 40:33.757
Ah.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.839
Tick, tick, tick.

40:35.934 --> 40:40.849
You see, each clock tick means
a soul has left my domain.

40:41.898 --> 40:45.356
Do I look like I like to lose anything?

40:46.861 --> 40:49.773
I did what you asked. I didn't want to.

40:49.906 --> 40:52.864
l... ljeopardized
my relationship with her...

40:52.909 --> 40:57.369
Yes, because you thought
you could get her to do what I wanted.

40:57.413 --> 40:58.573
Which you couldn't.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.163
(CHUCKLES) If it makes you feel
any better,

41:01.209 --> 41:03.200
she's going to regret her decision.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.411
Don't threaten her. Or me.

41:07.048 --> 41:09.915
Now I want what I was promised.

41:10.176 --> 41:11.165
Ah.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.546
Really, Cora?

41:13.596 --> 41:16.759
I'm surprised you care
so much about Regina.

41:16.891 --> 41:20.975
Especially after what you did
to your other daughter.

41:21.062 --> 41:23.394
How do you know about Zelena?

41:23.439 --> 41:27.728
Oh, I know about everything,
including why you gave her up,

41:27.819 --> 41:29.810
all so you could claw your way out
of a miserable peasant life.

41:31.114 --> 41:35.232
Which suggests
the perfect punishment.

41:44.460 --> 41:48.248
Hurry now, Cora.
You have flour to deliver.

41:48.381 --> 41:50.872
That's what they do at mills, isn't it?

41:50.925 --> 41:55.419
I never paid much attention.
It seems like such dull work.

41:55.555 --> 41:56.886
CORA: No.

41:56.973 --> 42:00.136
No, you promised you'd save us.

42:00.268 --> 42:02.384
And you promised not to fail.
