08:43.356 --> 08:45.524
Remember, it's just acting, Jake.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.942
Sorry, dude.

08:47.027 --> 08:47.860
Ooh!

08:47.944 --> 08:49.737
Now, to kill you up!

08:49.821 --> 08:50.612
But wait!

08:50.697 --> 08:53.866
Surely this cannot be the
fair Princess Bubblegum.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.035
Where are her pink, flush cheeks?

08:56.119 --> 08:58.537
The long, gooey hair?
- Ugh!

08:58.621 --> 08:59.413
Oof!

08:59.497 --> 09:02.124
Clearly the Princess travels elsewhere.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.459
Later, Bubblegum!

09:03.543 --> 09:04.793
Get out there, man!

09:04.878 --> 09:06.587
l don't know if l can do this.

09:06.671 --> 09:07.755
Go, go, go, go!

09:07.839 --> 09:09.590
And that's how l,

09:09.674 --> 09:12.176
the Duke of Nuts, by disfiguring

09:12.260 --> 09:14.386
you beyond all recognition,

09:14.471 --> 09:16.889
humbly saved your life.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.390
Yeah! All right!

09:18.475 --> 09:19.391
Yeah!

09:19.476 --> 09:21.602
What was the point of
this little play again?

09:21.686 --> 09:22.519
[ gasps ]

09:22.604 --> 09:25.314
And why isn't the
Duke clapped in irons?

09:25.398 --> 09:26.231
She's right.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.234
lnnocent or not, I should accept
what's coming to me.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.070
Peppermint Butler.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.071
Oh, no.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.907
"Nut'n's" going my way today.

09:34.991 --> 09:35.908
Hup!

09:35.992 --> 09:38.327
Hup! Hup!
- No!

09:38.411 --> 09:39.244
Finn?

09:39.329 --> 09:40.788
The Duke didn't throw that bottle.

09:40.872 --> 09:41.705
Ugh.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.208
Princess, l have something
sucky to confess.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.168
l'm the one who threw the bottle.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.503
[ gasps ]

09:47.587 --> 09:48.754
l'm sorry.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.632
But l knew if l told you,
you'd hate me forever.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.966
Hmm.

09:53.051 --> 09:57.471
Well...I could never stay
mad at you forever.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.640
And you seem
genuinely penitent.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.601
l don't even know what that means,
but thank you.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.269
[ both laugh ]
Yeah!

10:04.354 --> 10:05.187
[ laughs ]

10:05.271 --> 10:08.440
But that doesn't douse
my hatred for the Duke!

10:08.525 --> 10:10.359
Yeah, what's up with that hate?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.821
That jerk always empties
out my pudding pantry!

10:13.905 --> 10:14.822
Aw, shucks.

10:14.906 --> 10:17.116
He just can't control
himself around pudding.

10:17.200 --> 10:21.286
He goes coconutsfor it because
he has a pudding deficiency.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.080
lt's true, your majesty.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.833
l -- l'm sorry for my medical condition.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.126
Oh, my.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.836
You poor man.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.838
Of course you're forgiven.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.840
Yeah, l don't believe a word for a minute.

10:32.924 --> 10:33.799
[ sighs ]

10:33.883 --> 10:37.052
l'm really sorry about making you
temporarily ugly, Princess,

10:37.137 --> 10:40.264
especially before the
Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.474
l wish there was some
way to make it up to you.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.685
Maybe there is, Finn.

10:44.769 --> 10:45.602
Maybe there is.

Hey!

10:47.939 --> 10:48.730
Hmm? What?

You said "Maybe."

Call to order the sesquicentennial
grand meeting of Ooo Royalty.

10:55.363 --> 10:59.658
l now call upon the delegate
from the Candy Kingdom.

indeed to present myself against
