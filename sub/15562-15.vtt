WEBVTT

00:01.694 --> 00:03.128
Don't worry,

00:03.162 --> 00:06.538
uh, Tori can cover your shift.
You just get some rest.

00:06.624 --> 00:08.066
Thanks, Glenn.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.467
- Hey, is that Amy?
- Yeah.

00:09.502 --> 00:11.002
She's got a terrible cold.

00:11.037 --> 00:13.138
Oh, no. Hey, sweetie.

00:13.172 --> 00:16.074
You sound terrible...
shrill, but in a different way.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.706
Yeah... It's pretty bad.

00:17.707 --> 00:20.574
Uh-huh. Hey, Ames,
can you hold on a sec?

00:21.567 --> 00:23.692
- Yeah, she's faking.
- No, she is not.

00:23.692 --> 00:25.450
Glenn, I love Amy like a sister,

00:25.484 --> 00:27.929
and she is a liar and a fraud,
like my sister.

00:27.930 --> 00:29.902
I'm still on, by the way.

00:29.902 --> 00:31.623
Hey, sweetie!

00:31.657 --> 00:33.024
You ignore her.

00:33.059 --> 00:34.712
You just get well soon, okay?

00:34.713 --> 00:38.763
Thank you.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.134
So can I pretend to be sick
to miss school Monday?

00:43.169 --> 00:45.136
No, this is different.

00:45.171 --> 00:45.763
How?

00:46.205 --> 00:47.706
It just is. It's an adult thing.

00:47.740 --> 00:49.474
You'll understand someday. Come on.

00:49.508 --> 00:50.484
Hi...

00:52.647 --> 00:55.868
Oh, my God, that's Jeff,
my district manager.

00:55.869 --> 00:59.110
Why would he come all the way
out here to watch a movie?

01:04.275 --> 01:07.552

01:07.752 --> 01:09.719
I mean, I'm just saying, we're friends,

01:09.996 --> 01:11.909
so if you did play hooky yesterday,

01:11.973 --> 01:13.030
you can totally tell me.

01:13.032 --> 01:15.218
I wasn't.

01:15.219 --> 01:16.706
Are you sure you should
be drinking coffee?

01:16.706 --> 01:18.136
Caffeine mixed with cold medication

01:18.170 --> 01:19.619
can have the same effects as meth.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.138
Really? I've never heard that.

01:21.138 --> 01:21.993
Oh, it's true.

01:23.814 --> 01:24.574
I guess...

01:25.998 --> 01:26.998
Yeah, all of it.

01:31.808 --> 01:34.476
Hey, Sandra. How's it going?

01:34.578 --> 01:36.613
Pretty good. Someone stole my cat again.

01:36.789 --> 01:39.224
Excuse me, I'm having
a conversation with Amy.

01:39.258 --> 01:40.786
I think we were all caught up.

01:40.815 --> 01:41.578
Are we?

01:42.507 --> 01:44.007
How are things, Sandra.

01:44.050 --> 01:45.317
How's Jeff?

01:45.398 --> 01:48.100
Great. He might take me to Paris.

01:48.189 --> 01:52.125
Aww, Paris? That sounds so serious.

01:52.127 --> 01:53.494
I hate Paris.

01:53.496 --> 01:55.764
That place is just
one giant gay ashtray.

01:56.976 --> 01:58.243
Attention, Cloud 9 shoppers,

01:58.277 --> 02:00.278
today is Cloud 9's Wellness Fair,

02:00.313 --> 02:01.947
where we're offering vision tests,

02:01.981 --> 02:03.782
blood pressure screenings,
and tips on living

02:03.823 --> 02:05.370
your best, healthiest life.

02:05.596 --> 02:07.664
Why go to a doctor when you
can get medical advice

02:07.698 --> 02:10.226
from the same place you get dish soap?

02:11.802 --> 02:13.770
I love the Wellness Fair.

02:13.804 --> 02:16.339
We're gonna save a lot of lives today.

02:16.373 --> 02:19.342
It's mostly handing out
informational pamphlets, right?

02:19.376 --> 02:20.398
And buttons.

02:20.944 --> 02:22.845
You know, I, uh...
I actually thought about

02:22.880 --> 02:24.647
going to medical school for a minute.

02:24.682 --> 02:25.982
- No way.
- Yeah.

02:26.016 --> 02:29.318
- I wanted be a doctor too.
- Really?

02:29.353 --> 02:30.820
Yes, really.

02:30.854 --> 02:32.488
Why is that a surprise?

02:32.523 --> 02:33.856
It's not.

02:33.891 --> 02:35.758
You don't think I could be a doctor?

02:35.793 --> 02:37.260
No, no-no-no. Glenn, come on, no.

02:37.294 --> 02:39.829
I just... I'm... I don't even think
I could be a doctor.

02:39.863 --> 02:42.432
Oh... Not even you.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.333
No, that's... I...
that's out of context.

02:44.368 --> 02:46.501
I have to take these buttons over there.

02:52.543 --> 02:55.678
I love medicine.
I watch all those shows.

02:55.713 --> 02:57.280
"I need 10ccs, stat."

02:57.314 --> 02:58.848
"Prep the incubation tray."

02:58.882 --> 03:00.683
"I can't have sex with you.

03:00.718 --> 03:03.453
I'm an intern."

03:03.487 --> 03:05.655
Yeah, that all sounds
pretty medically accurate.

03:05.689 --> 03:06.823
Hey, guys,

03:06.857 --> 03:11.794
if you knew that a friend's
boyfriend was cheating on her

03:11.829 --> 03:13.863
with another one of your friends,

03:13.897 --> 03:15.798
would you say something?

03:15.833 --> 03:18.000
Hmm, that's a tough one.

03:18.035 --> 03:19.969
Is it Kylie or Emily?

03:20.627 --> 03:23.973
Okay, look, I wasn't actually
home sick yesterday.

03:24.007 --> 03:25.179
I went to the movies,

03:25.195 --> 03:28.022
and I saw Jeff with... Mateo...

03:29.379 --> 03:31.756
Kissing each other.

03:33.517 --> 03:34.984
- Wow!
- Weird.

03:35.018 --> 03:35.985
- Whoa.
- Hmm.

03:36.019 --> 03:37.964
- Woof.
- Seriously?

03:38.522 --> 03:39.822
This is your reaction?

03:39.857 --> 03:41.924
Jeff is cheating on Sandra with Mateo.

03:41.959 --> 03:44.494
What do I do? Do I... do I...
do I talk to her?

03:44.528 --> 03:45.895
Do I confront him?

03:45.929 --> 03:48.013
Okay, here's what you do.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.100
Nothing.

03:51.135 --> 03:52.535
What? Come on.

03:52.569 --> 03:54.003
Look, you don't know the situation.

03:54.037 --> 03:55.404
This is like "Jurassic Park."

03:55.439 --> 03:56.672
You start messing around with something

03:56.707 --> 03:57.740
you don't know anything about,

03:57.775 --> 03:59.909
and before you know it,
you're getting bit in half

03:59.943 --> 04:01.944
while you're sitting on the toilet.

04:01.979 --> 04:04.489
It's true, Amy. That's what happens.

04:04.882 --> 04:06.849
Okay, thanks, guys.

04:06.884 --> 04:08.050
- This was great.
- Mm-hmm.

04:08.085 --> 04:09.431
Helpful. Thanks.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.241
Should we just tell her

04:12.243 --> 04:14.791
that Mateo's the one who's
been dating Jeff all along?

04:14.825 --> 04:16.526
Nah, it's better just to stay out of it.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.394
People don't need to
know who's boning who.

04:18.428 --> 04:19.529
Yeah.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.564
- Do you wanna hear my lawyer?
- Mm-mm.

04:21.598 --> 04:24.801
"Objection, your honor,
he's harassing the witness!"

04:24.835 --> 04:28.037
"Oh, that's not a judge, that's a bomb."

04:28.071 --> 04:32.141
It must be so rewarding to be a nurse.

04:32.176 --> 04:34.710
Well, except when patients die.

04:34.745 --> 04:36.979
That must be a real kick
in the shins, huh?

04:37.014 --> 04:37.780
Uh-huh.

04:37.815 --> 04:39.982
How many people have you seen die?

04:40.017 --> 04:41.083
I've seen, like, seven,

04:41.118 --> 04:43.653
but I'm not sure it counts,
'cause it was all at once.

04:43.687 --> 04:45.054
- Hey, uh, Glenn?
- Hm?

04:45.088 --> 04:47.890
Jonah, I'm talking
medicine to this nurse.

04:47.925 --> 04:49.058
Oh, I'm sorry, is that offensive?

04:49.092 --> 04:50.726
Do we say doctor now?

04:50.761 --> 04:51.928
Only to doctors.

04:51.962 --> 04:53.796
Hey, where should I put these cups?

04:53.831 --> 04:55.631
Put them over there
with the rest of them.

04:55.666 --> 04:58.134
I set up a little juice station
at the entrance...

04:58.168 --> 05:01.737
sort of a healthy treat
to get people in the mood.

05:01.772 --> 05:04.406
You know, uh, juice actually
isn't that healthy.

05:05.042 --> 05:07.743
Juice? It's from fruit.

05:07.778 --> 05:10.146
It's like the healthiest
stuff on the planet.

05:10.180 --> 05:10.947
He's right.

05:10.981 --> 05:13.516
Fruit juice is loaded with sugar.

05:13.550 --> 05:14.706
Oh, good to know.

05:15.519 --> 05:19.088
I guess Jonah's right,
and I'm something else.

05:19.122 --> 05:21.924
Hey, uh, did you see
that documentary "Fed Up"?

05:21.959 --> 05:23.426
- Oh, with Katie Couric?
- Yeah.

05:23.460 --> 05:25.428
Loved it. Did you see "Fork over Knife"?

05:25.462 --> 05:27.630
Oh, my God. I... I was devastated by it.

05:27.664 --> 05:30.433
- Did you guys see
"BABE 2: Pig in the City"?

05:30.467 --> 05:33.450
I seem to have wound up with
two copies at my house.

05:34.905 --> 05:36.707
I picked you up some samples.

05:38.809 --> 05:40.443
There's like 50 condoms in here.

05:40.477 --> 05:42.712
Show some gratitude.
They're for your penis.

05:42.746 --> 05:44.614
- Thank you?
- You're welcome.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.883
Now did Amy say anything to you
about what she was doing yesterday?

05:46.917 --> 05:48.551
- No.
- Would you tell me if she did?

05:48.585 --> 05:50.853
- No.
- You don't deserve these.

05:50.888 --> 05:53.956
Okay, fine, I don't like condoms anyway.

05:53.991 --> 05:55.958
Well played. Now I call first dibs,

05:55.993 --> 05:58.027
but you can use those
with whoever you want...

05:58.061 --> 06:00.463
I mean, me, someone else, solo work.

06:00.497 --> 06:01.493
Solo work?

06:02.032 --> 06:03.833
So according to your wellness chart,

06:03.867 --> 06:05.969
you should shave that mustache.

06:06.737 --> 06:08.618
- Can I see that?
- Shave it.

06:09.743 --> 06:10.938
You'll thank me later.

06:11.575 --> 06:14.844
Hey! What up, my... hm... Mateo?

06:14.878 --> 06:17.179
- Okay?
- How's it hanging?

06:17.214 --> 06:19.181
- Who you seeing?
- Oh, God.

06:19.216 --> 06:20.917
Okay, can you please stop
trying to set me up

06:20.951 --> 06:22.919
with your brother? Okay? No offense,

06:22.953 --> 06:24.921
maybe he just doesn't photograph well.

06:24.955 --> 06:26.522
Okay, look, I saw you
at the movie theater

06:26.556 --> 06:27.682
yesterday with Jeff.

06:30.527 --> 06:32.695
Can we please not talk about this here?

06:32.729 --> 06:34.864
Talk about what, Mateo?
The fact that I saw you

06:34.898 --> 06:36.766
making out with Sandra's boyfriend?

06:36.800 --> 06:38.067
Okay.

06:38.101 --> 06:40.836
He's not her boyfriend.
He's my boyfriend.

06:40.871 --> 06:42.753
- What?
- I've been seeing him since October.

06:42.755 --> 06:43.941
That doesn't make any sense.

06:43.974 --> 06:45.817
No, you haven't.

06:46.977 --> 06:48.210
That's us on a picnic.

06:48.245 --> 06:50.112
That's us at the pool in his hotel.

06:50.147 --> 06:51.914
That's us as Nick Nolte
and Barbara Streisand

06:51.949 --> 06:53.400
in "Prince of Tides."

06:54.318 --> 06:57.086
What about Sandra?

06:57.120 --> 06:59.889
She's just been saying she's
dating him to get attention.

06:59.923 --> 07:02.191
Oh, my God. That is...

07:02.225 --> 07:03.396
That is so...

07:03.398 --> 07:04.027
Smart.

07:04.061 --> 07:05.127
Sad.

07:05.162 --> 07:07.596
Sad. Yes.

07:07.631 --> 07:11.033
Well, could you just please not
say anything to anyone?

07:11.068 --> 07:12.868
It wouldn't be good if this got out.

07:12.903 --> 07:15.037
No... yeah, obviously.

07:15.072 --> 07:15.838
I wonder if they'll last,

07:15.872 --> 07:17.540
because of the huge age difference,

07:17.574 --> 07:18.874
but I'm really excited.

07:18.909 --> 07:20.743
- Hey, Ames, guess what?
- Huh?

07:20.777 --> 07:23.431
Jeff's banging Mateo,
and Sandra's insane.

07:24.181 --> 07:25.915
Don't tell anyone though.

07:25.949 --> 07:27.917
Hey, Gare, guess what?

07:34.023 --> 07:35.990
So neither one of you
thought it was worth mentioning

07:36.024 --> 07:38.001
that Sandra's been making
it up the whole time?

07:38.001 --> 07:39.994
Maybe it'll be good
for everyone to know.

07:40.028 --> 07:41.996
Maybe Sandra will be happy.

07:41.996 --> 07:44.298
Yeah, 'cause that's usually
why people with low self-esteem

07:44.333 --> 07:46.200
commit to elaborate lies for weeks...

07:46.234 --> 07:47.168
'cause they just want
the truth to come out.

07:47.596 --> 07:49.303
Okay, I can fix this.
I just need to gather

07:49.338 --> 07:51.205
everybody who knows, and then tell them.

07:51.239 --> 07:53.174
Why aren't you listening to me?

07:53.208 --> 07:54.642
Just do nothing.

07:54.676 --> 07:56.689
It is the easiest advice to take.

07:57.079 --> 07:58.601
I do it, and I am thriving.

07:59.381 --> 08:01.373
Man, that is true. He's killing it.

08:02.351 --> 08:03.250
Killing it.

08:28.410 --> 08:30.566
Hey, Glenn, you want
a little help with that?

08:30.568 --> 08:32.078
Those things can be tricky.

08:32.114 --> 08:34.248
It's okay, I know how to ride a bike.

08:34.282 --> 08:36.051
I've been doing it since I was 19.

08:36.145 --> 08:37.450
Oh, all right.

08:38.453 --> 08:41.389
Yeah, you know what, I...
these things are ridiculous.

08:41.423 --> 08:43.557
How 'bout I just help ya
maybe adjust some of the...

08:43.592 --> 08:45.292
You know what? Why don't you just adjust

08:45.327 --> 08:48.095
your mouth to closed? Okay, buddy?

08:48.130 --> 08:51.055
I mean, what are you?
The president of bikes?

08:51.633 --> 08:53.552
You... are you okay? Glenn?

08:55.337 --> 08:56.337
Are you okay?

08:59.408 --> 09:02.443
- Glenn?
- I'm okay.

09:04.646 --> 09:06.313
Hey. Did Amy say anything to you

09:06.348 --> 09:07.982
about where she was yesterday?

09:08.016 --> 09:10.317
Uh, what? Uh, no, why?

09:10.352 --> 09:12.386
Um... I don't know, you know.

09:12.421 --> 09:14.655
She's always yap-yapping
about something.

09:14.690 --> 09:16.390
You know, something
suspicious is going on.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.421
What she described to me yesterday...

09:19.139 --> 09:21.672
I just can't even figure out
the mechanics of it.

09:22.698 --> 09:23.388
Huh...

09:25.143 --> 09:26.300
Attention, shoppers,

09:26.324 --> 09:28.612
Cloud 9 is not offering breast exams

09:28.646 --> 09:30.347
as part of our Wellness Fair.

09:30.381 --> 09:32.482
We have not hired someone to do that,

09:32.517 --> 09:35.552
and if we had, it would
not be a teenage boy

09:35.587 --> 09:38.522
in a Twenty One Pilots T-shirt.
Shop safe.

09:38.589 --> 09:40.838
These are slippery
little things, aren't they?

09:40.840 --> 09:42.225
Yeah, well, it's tough.
You... you know what,

09:42.260 --> 09:43.226
let me... let me just
go ahead and help ya.

09:43.261 --> 09:45.162
No, but that's what I'm doing.
I'm a grownup.

09:45.196 --> 09:46.997
Yeah, no, it's... it's fine.
I'm gonna take your foot,

09:47.031 --> 09:49.199
and I'm gonna just
slide it into the cage, okay?

09:49.233 --> 09:51.134
Just... just gonna slide it in.

09:51.169 --> 09:53.236
That's the voice you use
with confused seniors.

09:53.271 --> 09:55.072
Don't do that.
No, that's-I'm not doing...

09:55.106 --> 09:57.074
This is just the way I talk.
Fine, you can do that foot.

09:57.108 --> 09:58.408
- I'll work on this one, okay?
- No, Glenn, that's...

09:58.443 --> 10:00.210
- That's not how a bike works.
- No!

10:00.244 --> 10:02.412
- You must know that.
- They're not related.

10:02.447 --> 10:03.880
- Left, right.
- No...

10:03.915 --> 10:07.184
So she just invented
the entire relationship?

10:07.218 --> 10:08.318
She's a maniac.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.088
Ew, I just realized
that pair of Jeff's underwear

10:11.122 --> 10:13.924
that she showed me
probably weren't even Jeff's.

10:13.958 --> 10:15.192
That's so gross.

10:15.226 --> 10:17.694
She's definitely out of wine club.

10:17.729 --> 10:19.529
Wait, you guys have a wine club?

10:19.564 --> 10:21.398
Yeah, we're trying to keep it small.

10:21.432 --> 10:24.234
Look, this really is none
of your business, you know.

10:24.268 --> 10:25.732
You... you don't even
know the whole story.

10:25.748 --> 10:26.581
It you knew the whole story,

10:26.615 --> 10:28.205
you wouldn't think she was a maniac.

10:28.205 --> 10:29.631
What's the whole story?

10:30.565 --> 10:32.163
Don't do it.

10:32.164 --> 10:36.298
The whole story is that
she did date Jeff.

10:37.143 --> 10:39.311
It was very intense,
and then they broke up.

10:39.345 --> 10:42.414
Yup, they broke up.
It happened on a Tuesday.

10:42.449 --> 10:45.184
- See? Confirmation.
- So she got dumped,

10:45.218 --> 10:47.319
but then lied and told everyone
they were still dating?

10:47.353 --> 10:49.988
- Why would she do that?
- 'Cause she's a maniac.

10:50.023 --> 10:51.790
No. That is a good question,

10:51.825 --> 10:53.659
and we asked her that question,

10:53.693 --> 10:56.328
and what she said made a lot of sense.

10:56.362 --> 10:59.221
She told us that...

10:59.699 --> 11:01.633
She's pregnant.

11:01.668 --> 11:03.168
And the raptors

11:03.203 --> 11:04.269
have breached the fence.

11:04.304 --> 11:05.704
- She's pregnant?
- Yes!

11:05.739 --> 11:07.306
- Who's pregnant?
- Nobody.

11:07.340 --> 11:09.174
- The maniac.
- Sandra.

11:09.209 --> 11:12.177
Sandra? That is wonderful.

11:12.212 --> 11:13.679
I knew it. You can tell by the glow.

11:13.713 --> 11:14.680
I always know.

11:14.714 --> 11:16.281
- I'm gonna go congratulate her.
- No, no, Glenn,

11:16.316 --> 11:18.317
uh, she doesn't want
anybody to know yet,

11:18.351 --> 11:20.619
so we can't mention it to her.
Yeah, we should probably wait

11:20.653 --> 11:22.187
'til she inevitably starts showing.

11:22.222 --> 11:24.927
Oh! We could plan a baby shower.

11:24.928 --> 11:27.326
And what if the theme was babies?

11:27.360 --> 11:29.128
Or manufacturing?

11:29.162 --> 11:30.496
Oh, I know. "Breaking Bad."

11:30.530 --> 11:31.730
"Arabian Nights."

11:31.765 --> 11:33.232
No one likes "Arabian Nights"!

11:33.266 --> 11:34.566
Okay, no baby shower, guys.

11:34.601 --> 11:36.168
You're making a big deal out of this,

11:36.202 --> 11:37.703
and she doesn't even know
if she's gonna keep it.

11:38.772 --> 11:40.372
- What?
- Ooh.

11:40.406 --> 11:42.207
No, you don't mean she's gonna...

11:42.242 --> 11:43.075
Uh-huh.

11:43.109 --> 11:46.211
Yeah, she might do it on a Wednesday.

11:46.246 --> 11:48.147
Okay, we're good on the days.

11:50.587 --> 11:52.153
Look at this.

11:52.187 --> 11:53.955
Oh!

11:53.989 --> 11:56.724
Oh! Bear-bear.

11:57.571 --> 12:00.550
You know, sometimes
I like to walk around the store,

12:00.552 --> 12:04.522
and just think of all the things
that make life wonderful.

12:04.556 --> 12:07.091
You know, like, um, rivers

12:07.126 --> 12:11.780
and lunch and soccer and...

12:12.898 --> 12:14.432
Crime? No, not crime.

12:14.466 --> 12:17.742
Uh, streams!
Well, that's a cousin of rivers.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.472
And babies. I love babies.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.474
- Horses?
- Sure, horses,

12:23.509 --> 12:26.874
but what about babies?
Yeah. Babies are cute.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.642
You'd make a great mommy.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.042
- Thanks?
- Okay.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.867
Let's keep walking.

12:37.056 --> 12:38.990
Hey, what do you think

12:39.024 --> 12:42.186
is the worst Supreme Court
decision of all time?

12:43.095 --> 12:45.229
Maybe Glenn will just not say anything.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.698
Hey, guys, did you hear?

12:46.732 --> 12:49.233
Sandra's pregnant
with my boyfriend's baby.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.035
Oh, yeah, there's a card going around.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.638
This is why people
don't tell you things.

12:53.672 --> 12:55.306
I'm gonna fix it.

12:55.341 --> 12:56.975
Look, we could...

12:57.009 --> 12:59.243
we could say that it was
a phantom pregnancy.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.479
I've heard of that. Sandra, this must be

13:01.513 --> 13:04.215
a giant surprise for you. Love, Garrett.

13:04.249 --> 13:08.052
Okay, what if we say
that Jeff has a twin brother,

13:08.087 --> 13:10.254
and Sandra has been dating him?

13:10.289 --> 13:13.778
So the Jeff that Sandra's
been talking about

13:14.193 --> 13:16.946
is Jeff's twin brother, Jeff?

13:17.262 --> 13:19.530
- Yes.
- Oh, that sounds real.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.432
Well, at least she's thinking of things.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.730
You guys are idiots.

13:23.635 --> 13:25.603
Hey, you wanna donate to a good cause?

13:25.637 --> 13:28.106
I already told you, I'm not
paying to get you veneers.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.341
Nah, it's for Sandra's baby shower,

13:30.376 --> 13:31.743
assuming she keeps it.

13:31.777 --> 13:34.045
Wait, Sandra's pregnant?

13:34.079 --> 13:37.281
Yeah, Jeff knocked her up,
then dumped her for Mateo.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.616
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:38.650 --> 13:40.451
Wow, I can't believe it.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.421
Man, I wish I had the
stones to go both ways.

13:43.455 --> 13:44.698
Can you imagine?

13:45.090 --> 13:48.298
Two dudes... all gas, no brakes.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.728
Yeah, totally.

13:50.763 --> 13:55.299
But now imagine taking
this perfect little treasure,

13:55.334 --> 13:57.616
and throwing it in the garbage.

13:58.137 --> 13:59.303
Mm, mm-mm. Mm-mm.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.139
Hey, hey, hey. How are we doing?

14:01.173 --> 14:02.206
What's going on?
What are we talking about?

14:02.241 --> 14:04.071
Nothing. Why don't you mind
your own business?

14:04.072 --> 14:06.310
Oh, you know what, I will
mind my own business, Glenn,

14:06.345 --> 14:09.147
as long as you don't mind
Sandra's right to choose

14:09.181 --> 14:11.499
what she does with her body, right?

14:11.883 --> 14:15.185
I was thinking about getting
all the tattoos from "Moana."

14:15.354 --> 14:19.490
And I support that decision,
because it's your choice.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.226
Jonah, you might be
book smart and bike smart,

14:22.261 --> 14:24.762
but you don't get to be
right about everything.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.097
Well, in this particular situation,

14:26.131 --> 14:27.265
I think I am right, Glenn.

14:27.299 --> 14:30.068
Oh, really? That... there's
a refreshing change of pace.

14:30.102 --> 14:30.619
Yeah.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.862
Well, the important thing is
it all worked out horribly.

14:33.893 --> 14:35.776
...about a baby in a garbage can.

14:43.389 --> 14:44.533
If it was up to you,

14:44.534 --> 14:46.098
we'd still be living in the Stone Ages.

14:46.113 --> 14:47.638
Oh, really? Well, if it was up to you,

14:47.653 --> 14:50.129
they'd be selling abortions
from vending machines.

14:50.129 --> 14:52.732
Guys, guys, guys, maybe let's
not have this conversation

14:52.763 --> 14:53.646
out here on the floor.

14:53.647 --> 14:55.174
Jonah, you have no idea

14:55.204 --> 14:57.292
the toll that an abortion
takes on a woman's body.

14:57.293 --> 15:00.005
Oh, and childbirth is so easy.

15:00.006 --> 15:01.086
Well, at least it's n...

15:01.088 --> 15:02.169
Okay, ah, pretty sure
neither one of you guys...

15:02.170 --> 15:03.076
You know what, Glenn?

15:03.076 --> 15:04.941
This is what a feminist looks like.

15:04.942 --> 15:08.267
I'm a feminist!
I'm a big flaming feminist.

15:08.268 --> 15:12.373
And that is our skit
on the abortion debate.

15:12.374 --> 15:14.460
- We hope you enjoyed it.
- I can't...

15:15.187 --> 15:16.565
Why doesn't he listen?

15:17.973 --> 15:18.873
- Glenn?
- Are you okay?

15:18.907 --> 15:21.342
- Oh, I feel very dizzy.
- Oh... no, no, no.

15:21.377 --> 15:23.344
Can we get a doctor? Where's that nurse?

15:23.379 --> 15:24.545
Here just...

15:24.580 --> 15:25.953
One day, totally fine.

15:26.031 --> 15:28.616
Next day, so sick
she couldn't possibly work.

15:28.650 --> 15:30.549
Day after that, fine again.

15:31.253 --> 15:34.288
It could be lupus,
Crohn's disease, a parasite.

15:34.323 --> 15:36.691
Honestly, I would need a stool sample.

15:36.725 --> 15:38.026
I can get one.

15:38.060 --> 15:40.061
Okay, Glenn. Glenn?

15:40.095 --> 15:41.129
I need you to hold your hand like this,

15:41.163 --> 15:43.564
and breathe through
alternating nostrils, okay?

15:43.599 --> 15:44.499
Wow, how do you know how to do that?

15:44.533 --> 15:47.101
The Red Cross. I helped earthquake-proof

15:47.136 --> 15:49.270
a hospital in Haiti.
Well, bravo, it didn't work.

15:49.304 --> 15:52.240
No, it was after the...
for the next one.

15:52.274 --> 15:55.309
You'll see.
I mean, I hope you don't see.

15:55.344 --> 15:56.544
I'm just gonna
loosen your tie right here.

15:56.578 --> 15:59.047
No, stop telling me what to do!

15:59.081 --> 16:00.448
Glenn, you need to do
what he's telling you.

16:00.482 --> 16:02.150
No, I don't. He's stupid!

16:02.184 --> 16:04.085
- Glenn...
- I'm gonna tighten my tie.

16:04.119 --> 16:06.387
Okay. How's that working out for ya?

16:06.422 --> 16:08.523
- I feel perfectly good.
- Great.

16:10.107 --> 16:11.807
It was just low blood sugar.

16:11.841 --> 16:14.941
I shouldn't have tried to
quit drinking juice

16:14.941 --> 16:16.361
cold turkey like that.

16:17.174 --> 16:19.323
Great, okay, uh, also, we have checked.

16:19.394 --> 16:21.362
We don't seem to have
any training videos

16:21.373 --> 16:23.407
about not discussing abortion at work,

16:23.442 --> 16:25.798
because we just thought
it was so obvious,

16:25.799 --> 16:29.141
but you guys managed
to surprise us, so good job.

16:29.142 --> 16:30.981
- Whoo!
- Don't lecture us

16:31.016 --> 16:32.950
on being responsible when we all know

16:32.984 --> 16:34.652
what you did to Sandra.

16:34.686 --> 16:36.120
Sandra... who's Sandra?

16:36.154 --> 16:37.288
What?

16:37.322 --> 16:38.735
Who's Sandra?

16:38.736 --> 16:42.020
Just the woman who's pregnant
with your bi-racial child.

16:42.020 --> 16:44.362
In his defense, Sandra is
extremely forgettable.

16:44.396 --> 16:46.464
Remember when we left her at
Dave & Buster's on her birthday?

16:46.498 --> 16:48.599
- Yeah.
- I'm not pregnant.

16:48.633 --> 16:49.667
What?

16:49.701 --> 16:52.036
- Oh, God, am I too late?
- What?

16:52.070 --> 16:53.604
I'm very confused.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.473
Wait, so you didn't knock her up?

16:55.507 --> 16:57.695
No, I'm gay.

16:57.695 --> 17:01.712
Oh, yeah, right, you're gay,
and I'm Lorenzo Lamas.

17:01.747 --> 17:03.508
Well, I am. I'm gay.

17:04.549 --> 17:07.050
But you're so... blah.

17:07.085 --> 17:08.685
Well, wait, then who's dating Sandra?

17:08.720 --> 17:10.705
I made it up.

17:10.707 --> 17:12.123
I haven't been dating anyone.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.820
I mean, nothing here pops at all.

17:14.820 --> 17:16.493
Why would you make
something like that up?

17:16.528 --> 17:18.462
'Cause she's a maniac.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.564
At first it was a misunderstanding,

17:20.598 --> 17:23.401
and then I just started
liking the attention.

17:23.435 --> 17:26.503
For the first time in
my life, I was a star.

17:26.538 --> 17:27.637
I'm the one who's been dating Jeff.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.240
Okay, the whole time...

17:29.274 --> 17:30.741
- me-me-me-me-me.
- Um...

17:30.776 --> 17:33.010
We were keeping that between us.

17:33.044 --> 17:35.312
I just don't get it.

17:35.347 --> 17:38.411
If you can be gay, that
means anyone can be gay.

17:38.412 --> 17:40.665
Okay, well, you know,
cat's out of the bag.

17:41.086 --> 17:42.720
Me and Jeff.

17:42.754 --> 17:44.155
Does anybody have any questions?

17:44.189 --> 17:46.190
Can we please keep this in this room?

17:46.224 --> 17:48.659
I'm not supposed to be dating
anybody from one of the stores.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.494
But casual sex is okay, right?

17:50.529 --> 17:52.430
'Cause I've been banging Garrett
on and off for a while now.

17:52.464 --> 17:53.597
What?

17:53.632 --> 17:56.367
Uh, that is correct.

17:56.401 --> 17:58.235
- Whoa!
- Really?

17:58.270 --> 18:00.004
And you... you didn't tell me?

18:00.038 --> 18:01.605
I'm sorry, it just...
we haven't told anybody.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.174
It's fine, I don't... I don't care.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.443
What has happened to this store?

18:05.477 --> 18:07.178
Me. I happened.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.612
This is me. This is my fault.

18:08.647 --> 18:10.514
I opened the cage, or whatever.

18:10.549 --> 18:11.715
I've never seen "Jurassic Park."

18:11.750 --> 18:13.784
What?

18:13.819 --> 18:16.454
Okay, that is not what we're
dealing with right now.

18:16.488 --> 18:18.255
Look, I should not have gotten involved.

18:18.290 --> 18:20.591
Sandra, I'm really sorry.

18:20.625 --> 18:22.793
No, I feel great.

18:22.828 --> 18:24.695
No more lies. No more credit card debt

18:24.729 --> 18:26.578
from buying myself flowers.

18:27.265 --> 18:29.366
I can cancel the horse-drawn carriage.

18:29.401 --> 18:30.367
I almost told you a couple times.

18:30.402 --> 18:31.769
I said it's fine.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.745
Sorry, I just got excited
to finally tell people.

18:41.780 --> 18:43.113
No, it's okay.

18:43.148 --> 18:44.648
I'm... I'm glad it's finally public.

18:44.683 --> 18:46.058
Okay.

18:47.452 --> 18:48.752
Why are we in here?

18:48.787 --> 18:50.554
I don't know.

18:50.589 --> 18:52.490
Why are you whispering?

18:52.524 --> 18:53.757
I don't know.

19:01.833 --> 19:03.100
He's my boyfriend!

19:04.803 --> 19:07.771
So that's why you didn't want me

19:07.806 --> 19:10.174
talking about people's love lives...

19:10.208 --> 19:13.277
because you had a little
secret of your own.

19:13.311 --> 19:14.144
Okay.

19:14.179 --> 19:16.647
Are we gonna get a destination wedding?

19:16.681 --> 19:18.849
Like, how many cute little

19:18.884 --> 19:20.751
Garrett-Dina babies are you gonna have?

19:20.785 --> 19:22.586
Garrett Junior?

19:22.621 --> 19:25.754
Hey, Dina, Amy went to go see
"Lego Batman" yesterday.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.859
I'm gonna have to call you back.

19:33.732 --> 19:36.491
What in the name of God
is "Lego Batman"?

19:39.304 --> 19:42.640
Wow, you're smoking now?

19:42.674 --> 19:45.209
No, I'm just holding it.

19:45.243 --> 19:46.777
- Ah.
- But I might as well start,

19:46.811 --> 19:49.513
since everything I thought
I knew was wrong.

19:49.548 --> 19:50.781
In five years, they'll probably say

19:50.815 --> 19:53.317
- smoking's good for you.
- Oh, no-no-no,

19:53.351 --> 19:54.974
decades of research and...

19:56.388 --> 19:59.138
You know what? You might be right.

19:59.691 --> 20:01.520
Nobody really knows anything.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.330
You mind if I, uh...

20:12.308 --> 20:13.675
It's nice.

20:13.905 --> 20:16.473
You look really cool right now.

20:16.508 --> 20:17.332
Yeah?

20:19.544 --> 20:21.845
I'm sorry about everything earlier.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.714
I've been off today.

20:23.748 --> 20:26.250
Going from two gallons
of juice a day to nothing

20:26.284 --> 20:28.719
has been messing with my head.

20:28.753 --> 20:30.093
Yeah, I get it.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.523
I'm sorry too.

20:34.593 --> 20:35.659
I just get sensitive,

20:35.694 --> 20:37.728
because sometimes I think
you're smarter than me.

20:37.762 --> 20:39.863
Oh, Glenn, come on, that's...

20:39.898 --> 20:41.765
I know, it's silly.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.869
You're probably always thinking
how much smarter I am than you.

20:47.606 --> 20:48.706
Yuh-huh.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.714
Hear ye! Hear ye!

20:56.748 --> 20:59.249
I've come to deliver
the fair maiden Sandra

20:59.284 --> 21:00.684
to good King Jeff.

21:00.719 --> 21:01.752
Right here.

21:02.554 --> 21:05.856
Couldn't get my deposit back.
See you tomorrow.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.891
- My lady.
- Thank you.

21:11.296 --> 21:14.318
Will you take me to the frozen
custard place at the mall?

21:15.305 --> 21:21.661
