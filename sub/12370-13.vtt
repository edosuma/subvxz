00:07.674 --> 00:10.051
SHE SHOULD BE BACK FROM HER DATE

00:12.512 --> 00:14.431

WITH MITCH.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.725
- I CAN'T.

00:16.808 --> 00:19.269
THINGS WILL BE SO MUCH SIMPLER
IF SHE WEREN'T MY FRIEND.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.062

IS WHEN A MAN LIKES YOU ENOUGH

YOU'VE KEPT THAT A SECRET?

01:42.101 --> 01:43.394
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN TORTURE.

01:43.478 --> 01:46.231
- ONLY WHEN I SAW HIM AT WORK
OR YOU AT HOME.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.692
- HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.

- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

02:06.459 --> 02:09.378
- WELL, IT'S LATE,
AND HE'S VULNERABLE,

02:09.461 --> 02:13.007
SO I REALLY SHOULDN'T TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THAT SITUATION.

02:13.091 --> 02:17.512
BUT I'VE JUST TYPED
THAT I'M ON MY WAY OVER.

REMINDER TO YOU

FOR A WHILE.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.918
WELL, SINCE THERE'S NO CHANCE
OF WINNING HER BACK,

08:22.001 --> 08:23.377

08:23.461 --> 08:25.296
THERE'S A WINE BAR ON THE LAKE
NOT FAR FROM HERE.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.297
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.090
IF I'M GONNA MOVE ON,

08:28.174 --> 08:29.300
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
IF SHE'S REALLY INTO THIS GUY.

08:29.383 --> 08:33.054
- FINE, BUT IT COULD BE
DEVASTATING.

08:33.136 --> 08:37.767
LUCKILY I HAVE THESE VERY BARE
SHOULDERS FOR YOU TO CRY ON.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.065

FROM ROSS BARKLEY.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.442
YOU WANT HIS ENDORSEMENT
FOR CITY COUNCIL,

08:46.525 --> 08:49.779
AND I WANT TO BE A SPOKESPERSON

GETTING WHAT WE WANT ARE SLIM.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.915
- WAIT.
WHY DID YOU GIVE IN SO EASILY?

09:02.667 --> 09:04.293
YOU THINK HE'LL TURN ME DOWN,

09:04.377 --> 09:06.295
AND THEN HE'LL FEEL BAD,
AND THEN HE'LL SAY YES TO YOU?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.422
I'LL GO SECOND.

- PERFECT.
I'LL GO FIRST.

ALL ALONG.

WHERE ONE OF THE WINE GLASSES
HAS POISON IN IT,

09:17.765 --> 09:19.308
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE
IT IS.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.353
- CALM DOWN, VICTORIA.

09:22.436 --> 09:23.813
AND DRINK YOUR WINE.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.321
- SO JERRY JONES SAYS TO ME,

TALKING.

09:37.702 --> 09:40.037
- YEAH, STILL DON'T KNOW
WHO THAT IS.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.956
- JOY, YOU KNOW MELANIE'S TELLS.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.666
WHAT IS SHE FEELING RIGHT NOW?

09:43.749 --> 09:47.712
- WELL, I DO KNOW THAT THAT'S
THE LOOK MELANIE GIVES

09:47.795 --> 09:49.547
WHEN SHE'S REALLY INTO SOMEONE.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.219
- REALLY?

09:55.303 --> 09:56.679
LOOKS LIKE SHE WANTS TO BE
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.807
- YEAH, IN HIS BED.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.184
IF MELANIE LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S HAVING A GOOD TIME,

10:02.268 --> 10:03.227
SHE REALLY ISN'T.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.354
BUT IF SHE LOOKS BORED
AND DISGUSTED,

10:05.438 --> 10:07.189
SHE'S HAVING A GREAT TIME.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.150
- REALLY?

10:09.233 --> 10:10.568
AND IF SHE'S STIFLING A YAWN...

10:10.651 --> 10:12.361
- SHE'S STIFLING AN ORGASM.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.410
- SO ANYWAY, I JUST STARTED
HOSTING A RADIO TALK SHOW

10:19.493 --> 10:20.536
CALLED <i> ASK MELANIE.</i>

10:20.620 --> 10:22.163
- YOU'RE <i> ASK MELANIE?</i>

10:22.246 --> 10:23.914
- YOU KNOW MY SHOW?

10:23.998 --> 10:26.334
- NO--I ALMOST CALLED IN
A FEW TIMES.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.002
I'M A HUGE FAN.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.545
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

10:29.628 --> 10:30.921
- LOOK AT THAT SMILE.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.257
THAT MEANS SHE'S NOT INTO HIM,
RIGHT?

10:33.341 --> 10:35.009
- OH, THAT'S NOT A REAL SMILE.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.802
THAT'S JUST GAS.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.723
SHE'S LIKE A BABY.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.142
ONCE SHE BURPS, IT'LL BE GONE.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.771
- SO THE SECRET TO MY JOB,

10:46.854 --> 10:48.731
AND IT TOOK ME A WHILE
TO LEARN THIS,

10:48.814 --> 10:51.609
IS TO BE 100% NONJUDGMENTAL.

10:51.692 --> 10:55.404
- OH, THAT IS SO GOOD TO HEAR.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.281
BECAUSE THE THING I WANTED
TO ASK YOU ON THE RADIO,

10:57.365 --> 11:00.076
I CAN'T TELL ANYONE.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.871
- YOU CAN TELL ME NOW.

11:03.954 --> 11:06.248
- SEE, I WAS IN A PLANE CRASH
IN THE MOUNTAINS OF PERU.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.085
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.420
- I WAS THE SOLE SURVIVOR.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.090
ONCE THE FOOD RAN OUT,

11:14.173 --> 11:16.759
I REALLY ONLY HAD
ONE HORRIBLE OPTION.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.724
- ARE YOU SAYING WHAT I THINK
YOU'RE SAYING?

11:25.184 --> 11:26.352
- YES.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.816
- WOW.
SHE LOOKS NAUSEOUS.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.443
- I'M REALLY JEALOUS.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.446
SHE NEVER LOOKED AT ME
LIKE THAT.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.198
- YOU KNOW, EVERYONE THINKS
IT'LL TASTE LIKE CHICKEN.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.620
IT DOESN'T.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.622
IT TASTES LIKE WHITEFISH.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.334
HOW IS YOUR WHITEFISH,
BY THE WAY?

11:53.003 --> 11:53.963
- IT'S OKAY.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.006
- HELLO.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.633
ROSS BARKLEY, RIGHT?

11:57.716 --> 11:59.176
I'M VICTORIA CHASE,

11:59.260 --> 12:01.929
AND I'M A HUGE FAN
OF PEOPLE FEEDING PEOPLE.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.644
I DON'T MEAN TO OFFER MYSELF UP
TO YOU ON A PLATTER,

12:08.727 --> 12:11.397
BUT...

12:11.480 --> 12:14.442
I'D REALLY LIKE TO BE
YOUR SPOKESPERSON.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.318
AND I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY
RIGHT NOW,

12:16.402 --> 12:18.320
BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE SOMETIME
WE COULD GET TOGETHER

12:18.404 --> 12:22.658
AND CHEW THE FAT
AND FLESH OUT SOME IDEAS.

12:22.741 --> 12:25.953
AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,
JUST FEEL FREE TO GRILL ME.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.501
- ARE YOU NOT LISTENING?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.170
HE'S A CANNIBAL.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.673
HE EATS PEOPLE.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.134
- HE ATE ONE PERSON, MELANIE.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.344
DON'T EXAGGERATE.

12:42.428 --> 12:46.307
- WE'VE ALL DONE THINGS.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.143
- YEAH, WE ATE THAT EGGPLANT
DISH YOU MADE LAST WEEK.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.188
LOOK, THE MAN'S PLANE CRASHED.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.023
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
HE COULD SURVIVE.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.691
- ANY ONE OF US
IN THAT SITUATION

12:55.774 --> 12:58.194
WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.945
- I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.698
- OH.
THERE YOU GO.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.201
AND COULD YOU JUST TRY TO LOOK
A LITTLE MORE INTO HIM,

13:05.284 --> 13:09.413
LIKE HIS CANNIBALISM
WAS JUST A LOVEABLE QUIRK?

13:09.497 --> 13:11.499
- FINE.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.835
- OKAY, I'LL ASK.

13:14.919 --> 13:18.881
DO WE TASTE LIKE CHICKEN?

13:18.964 --> 13:21.008
- NO.
WHITEFISH.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.302
- FISH?
WE TASTE LIKE FISH?

13:23.385 --> 13:25.554
- PORK I COULD BELIEVE,
BUT FISH?

13:25.638 --> 13:26.889
- HUH.

13:26.972 --> 13:31.393
I THOUGHT WE'D BE CHEWY,
NOT FLAKY.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.897
- MELANIE, HUMANS TASTING LIKE
FISH DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.066
- OH, I'M SORRY.

13:37.149 --> 13:41.070
I'M DEFERRING TO THE MAN
WHO ACTUALLY ATE HUMAN FLESH!

13:43.030 --> 13:44.865
- WHAT DID MELANIE SAY?

13:44.949 --> 13:47.868
- I'M SORRY, MITCH.
SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT HIM.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.454
SHE THINKS HE'S THE SEXIEST MAN
SHE'S EVER MET.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.915
- REALLY?
HIM?

13:52.998 --> 13:54.917
I'M IN BETTER SHAPE THAN HE IS.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.254
- OH, MELANIE HATES GUYS
WHO WORK OUT TOO MUCH.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.422
THE BIGGER, THE BETTER,
THAT'S HER MOTTO.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.424
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S IT.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.927
MELANIE'S INTO BIGGER GUYS.

14:05.010 --> 14:05.886
THAT'S WHY SHE BROKE UP
WITH ME.

14:05.970 --> 14:09.139
SHE LIKES A MAN WITH MEAT
ON HIS BONES.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.724
- APPARENTLY SHE'S NOT ALONE.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.395
- WHY DID I LOSE
ALL THAT WEIGHT?

14:14.478 --> 14:17.439
STUPID, STUPID, STUPID.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.775
OKAY, NOW'S MY CHANCE.
I'M GONNA GO WIN HER BACK.

14:19.858 --> 14:21.902
- OH, MITCH,
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.405
- MELANIE, GIVE ME ONE MONTH.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.949
I'LL GAIN 100 POUNDS.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.242
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:28.325 --> 14:29.910
- I'M TOO THIN, RIGHT?

14:29.994 --> 14:30.953
I'M NOT YOUR TYPE.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.246
THAT'S WHY YOU LIKE ROSS.

14:32.329 --> 14:33.956
YOU NEED SOMETHING
TO GRAB ON TO.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.250
- IS THAT WHAT JOY SAID?
- YES.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.294
- WELL, MY SECRET'S OUT.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.796
I LIKE BIG GUTS,
AND I CANNOT LIE.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.675
- HEY, SO WHAT DO YOU WEIGH,
BUDDY?

14:44.758 --> 14:46.343
TWO BILLS?
2 1/4?

14:46.427 --> 14:49.179
THAT USED TO BE MY LEFT LEG.

14:49.263 --> 14:50.306
HEAR THAT MELANIE.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.475
YOU DIDN'T EVEN EAT YOUR BREAD.

14:53.559 --> 14:57.313
DUDE, I USED TO SWEAT BUTTER.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.023
YOU CALL YOURSELF BIG?

14:59.106 --> 15:02.276
- NO, I DON'T.
WHO ARE YOU?

15:02.359 --> 15:04.278
- I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.989
I'M THE GUY THAT'S GONNA GAIN
300 POUNDS AND STEAL YOUR GIRL.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.826
HOLD UP THERE.
I NEED SOME DESSERT.

15:10.909 --> 15:13.495
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.997
- I'M FINE.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.624
RIGHT NOW NOTHING CAN BOTHER ME.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.208
- WELL, I WAS HAPPY TO HELP,
ROSS,

15:18.292 --> 15:21.837
BUT NOW IT IS TIME TO PUT
THE WHOLE THING BEHIND YOU.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.173
- NOT YET.
- MM.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.091
- THERE IS ONE MORE THING
I NEED TO CONFESS.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.051
- NO, REALLY?

15:27.134 --> 15:28.594
BECAUSE,
LIKE I TELL MY CALLERS,

15:28.677 --> 15:33.515
SOMETIMES IT'S BEST TO KEEP
THINGS BOTTLED UP.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.143
- I LIKED IT.

15:36.226 --> 15:40.356
I LIKED THE TASTE.
IT WAS DELICIOUS.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.775
I'VE BEEN CHASING THAT TASTE
EVER SINCE.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.282
SO CLOSE.

15:55.037 --> 15:58.874
- HE ATE A MAN,
AND HE LIKED IT.

15:58.957 --> 16:00.042
- COME ON, MELANIE.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.168
PUT THAT TO A CATCHY TUNE,

16:01.251 --> 16:03.545
AND IT'S A KATY PERRY SONG.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.051
- JOY MAKES AN EXCELLENT POINT.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.678
NOW WHO THINKS MELANIE

16:10.761 --> 16:13.555
SHOULD GET BACK TO HER DATE
WITH A CANNIBAL?

16:13.639 --> 16:14.765
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.266
- IT'S ONE DATE.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.893
AND YOU CAN'T BREAK UP
WITH HIM NOW.

16:17.976 --> 16:19.728
MITCH WILL THINK
YOU'RE STILL AVAILABLE.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.481
AND VICTORIA NEEDS
THE CHARITY CRED,

16:22.564 --> 16:25.567
AND DEAR, SWEET ELKA
NEEDS HER ENDORSEMENT.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.071
- OH, BLESS YOU, MY ANGEL.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.406
- YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.

16:30.489 --> 16:31.907
YOU GUILTED ME INTO THIS DATE,

16:31.990 --> 16:34.201
AND NOW YOU THINK YOU CAN GUILT
ME INTO STICKING WITH IT.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.744
WELL, IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
NOT THIS TIME.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.414
- SO YOU'RE ENDING THE DATE?

16:38.497 --> 16:40.916
- NO.

16:40.999 --> 16:43.252
- BUT YOU'RE NEVER GONNA DO
ANYTHING FOR US LIKE THIS AGAIN?

16:43.335 --> 16:44.586
- NO, I PROBABLY WILL.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.004
- THEN WHAT WAS THE POINT
OF THAT OUTBURST?

16:46.088 --> 16:47.047
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.264
- MELANIE SPEAKS VERY HIGHLY
OF YOU, ELKA.

16:55.347 --> 16:59.017
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHY YOU
WANT TO BE ON THE CITY COUNCIL?

16:59.101 --> 17:00.769
- TO SERVE MAN.

17:07.568 --> 17:11.195
WITH YOUR HELP, I COULD EAT
MY OPPONENT FOR BREAKFAST.

17:14.199 --> 17:17.202
- MELANIE.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.244
YOU TOLD HER?

17:18.328 --> 17:19.788
- NO. WHAT?
NO.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.250
- THE WAY I SEE IT,

17:23.333 --> 17:27.087
THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE
YOU COULD ENDORSE.

17:27.171 --> 17:31.467
ONE IS A FOOTBALL HERO.

17:31.550 --> 17:35.554
THE OTHER KNOWS YOU EAT PEOPLE.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.522
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I MAY HAVE SAID SOMETHING,

17:45.606 --> 17:47.900
BUT SHE REALLY DOES DESERVE
YOUR ENDORSEMENT.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.528
- OKAY, FINE.
SHE'S GOT IT.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.323
- REALLY?
THAT'S GREAT. OKAY.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.241
AND WHILE YOU'RE BEING
SO GENEROUS,

17:56.325 --> 17:59.870
MY FRIEND, VICTORIA, WOULD MAKE
A GREAT SPOKESPERSON

17:59.953 --> 18:03.415
FOR YOUR CHARITY,
PEOPLE FEEDING PEOPLE.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.000
- DONE.
- REALLY?

18:05.083 --> 18:05.834
- YAY!

18:07.086 --> 18:10.214
LIP-READER.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.507
- OF COURSE
SHE'S ATTRACTED TO HIM.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.966
LOOK AT THIS WIKIPEDIA PAGE.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.176
HE'S RICH.
HE'S WON A PULITZER PRIZE.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.011
HE...

18:16.095 --> 18:18.222
OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

18:18.305 --> 18:19.723
- FLIGHT 577.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.892
THAT PLANE THAT CRASHED IN PERU
TEN YEARS AGO.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.811
ROSS WAS ON THAT PLANE--
THE ONLY SURVIVOR.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.062
I GOT TO GO TALK TO HIM.
- OH, NO.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.523
NO, NO, NO.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.733
- EXCUSE ME, MR. BARKLEY,
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT BEFORE.

18:29.817 --> 18:30.984
I WAS WAY OUT OF LINE.

18:31.068 --> 18:35.864
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU
WERE ON FLIGHT 577?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.407
- YES, I WAS.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.869
- MY BEST FRIEND MARK GREAVES
WAS ON THAT PLANE.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.373
- MY GOD, I SAT NEXT TO HIM.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.874
- DID YOU TALK TO HIM?

18:45.958 --> 18:48.669
- YES, HE WAS A GREAT GUY.
VERY FRIENDLY.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.045
HE WAS A FASHION DESIGNER,
RIGHT?

18:50.128 --> 18:51.672
- YES.
HE HAD GREAT TASTE.

18:57.302 --> 19:00.848
- YES, HE REALLY DID.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.104
- MELANIE'S THE FIRST WOMAN
I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN

19:07.187 --> 19:08.772
SINCE MY DIVORCE.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.567
MAYBE THERE'S JUST
NO ONE OUT THERE FOR ME.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.695
- NO, THERE IS.
HONESTLY, SHE'S THERE.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.406
AT THE MARKET.
IN A BOOKSTORE.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.283
ON A COUCH.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.120
I'M A PRETTY GOOD DETECTIVE.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.913
MAYBE I COULD HELP YOU FIND HER.

19:24.997 --> 19:25.914
- YOU ARE A GOOD DETECTIVE.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.624
WE'RE A GREAT TEAM.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.918
WE'RE LIKE NICK AND NORA CHARLES
IN <i> THE THIN MAN.</i>

19:30.002 --> 19:31.753
- OH, I LOVE THOSE MOVIES.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.380
- REALLY?
ME TOO.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.715
I'VE GOT ONE DVR'D.
WE COULD WATCH IT RIGHT NOW.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.300
- I'D LOVE TO.

19:36.383 --> 19:37.885
- YOU'RE A GREAT GIRL, JOY.

19:37.968 --> 19:41.722
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SIMON GUY
LEFT YOU TWICE.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.765
- HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT SIMON?

19:43.849 --> 19:45.392
- I DO MY RESEARCH.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.269
I ALSO KNOW YOU GOT STOOD UP
AT THE ALTAR;

19:47.352 --> 19:48.270
YOU WERE BRIEFLY MARRIED
TO VICTORIA;

19:48.353 --> 19:49.605
YOU GOT DUMPED
BY A HOMELESS GUY.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.940
- YEAH, YEAH,
YOU DID YOUR RESEARCH.
