Whoa.
[groaning]

20:09.374 --> 20:14.279
Bon appétit.
Dinner is...whoa!

20:14.346 --> 20:15.948
Served.

Harvey!

20:24.289 --> 20:26.091
- Harvey!
- Huh?

20:26.158 --> 20:30.228
{\an1}Please!
We're so hungry!

20:30.295 --> 20:32.764
Stall 'em!
[panting]

20:32.831 --> 20:33.966
The pizza!

20:34.032 --> 20:35.734
I can't take this anymore!

20:35.801 --> 20:38.236
- I'm going after the boy!
- Ah!

20:38.303 --> 20:41.940
- [evil laughter]
- No!

20:43.275 --> 20:44.543
Where's my money?

20:44.610 --> 20:47.279
Uh, hey, Mom and Dad?

20:47.346 --> 20:49.615
I know I made
a pretty big mess tonight.

20:49.681 --> 20:52.284
Thanks.
But I realize something now.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.353
I really wanted
to cook dinner for you two,

20:54.419 --> 20:56.622
but I got lost along the way.

20:56.688 --> 20:59.891
I ignored the sacred teachings
of Marie Tender's.

20:59.958 --> 21:03.095
It's not about the chef,
it's about the guests.

21:03.161 --> 21:06.865
So allow me...

21:14.039 --> 21:15.774
Ah, thanks, sweetie.

21:15.841 --> 21:17.709
You know it's the thought
that counts.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.746
And you put so much thought
into tonight.

21:20.812 --> 21:23.949
{\an1}Oh, my gosh.
This pizza is good!

21:24.016 --> 21:25.417
It's got some zing to it.

21:25.484 --> 21:27.386
Harvey, what did you do
to the pizza?

21:27.452 --> 21:29.554
I sprinkled some paprika on it.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.823
Paprika makes everything fancy.

21:31.890 --> 21:35.794
{\an3}You managed to make
Randl's cheap pizza good!

21:35.861 --> 21:37.229
I did?

21:37.295 --> 21:39.131
{\an1}You sure did.
Thanks for dinner, Son.

21:39.197 --> 21:40.732
Oh, you're welcome.

21:40.799 --> 21:44.436
Well, I couldn't have done it
without my sous chefs.

{\an1}Don't squeeze.
Just ate.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.606
Sorry.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.608
Well, can we at least
help with the dishes?

21:49.675 --> 21:51.276
Nah, don't worry about it.

21:51.343 --> 21:54.079
{\an3}I'll get that kitchen cleaned up
first thing in the morning.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.181
