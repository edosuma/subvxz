HOMICIDAL HAM

00:06.490 --> 00:09.952
- Hiya, Sam.
- Hey, Carla.

00:10.119 --> 00:14.665
- Did you just get pregnant?
- No. I could, but this is just stuffing.

00:14.832 --> 00:18.294
- Why?
- I'm a little short and my rent is due.

00:18.461 --> 00:21.088
And pregnant women get better tips.

00:23.132 --> 00:27.303
It's dishonest, Sam.
You should tell her to get rid of it.

00:27.470 --> 00:29.847
I can't do that. She's Catholic.

00:33.893 --> 00:36.771
Watch it. I'm in a family way here.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.991
The kid's going to be a swimmer.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.446
Would you look at that?
Some idiot carved his initials on my bar.

02:10.531 --> 02:15.411
It's his initials and his girlfriend's.
It's sweet.

02:15.578 --> 02:21.542
No, it's not sweet. It's destructive.
I mean, who did that?

02:21.709 --> 02:24.420
SM plus DC.

02:29.133 --> 02:35.306
- I think it's romantic.
- No, it's not romantic. It's stupid.

02:35.472 --> 02:40.102
If you want romantic,
we could have our buns tattooed.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.275
Worth a shot.

02:46.442 --> 02:48.861
I'm just going to run a tab for you.

02:51.238 --> 02:53.282
Excuse me.

02:57.328 --> 03:00.497
May I speak with you for a moment,
please?

03:03.667 --> 03:08.923
Don't you recognise that man?
The ex-convict you paid to date me.

03:10.466 --> 03:14.470
He murdered a waitress
and fantasises his hands are claws.

03:14.637 --> 03:18.057
Oh, yeah.
How do you happen to remember him?

03:18.223 --> 03:21.894
Of course I recognise him.
His name is Andy. So what?

03:22.061 --> 03:24.146
So what is he doing here?

03:24.313 --> 03:27.566
I don't know.
He probably came in for a drink.

03:27.733 --> 03:32.571
As soon as you hang a sign out
that says "bar", you start getting that.

03:32.738 --> 03:38.869
Sam, you have to get rid of that killer.
He's dangerous.

03:39.036 --> 03:41.914
Look at him.
Does he look dangerous to you?

03:44.708 --> 03:48.629
- Not at the moment...
- He's a customer. That's all.

03:48.796 --> 03:52.049
He has every right to be here.
Now, don't worry.

03:52.216 --> 03:55.386
If he starts anything,
I know how to handle him.

03:55.552 --> 03:58.430
- Hey, Andy, isn't it?
- That's right.

03:58.597 --> 04:02.601
- And you're Sam.
- Correct. What'll you have, Andy?

04:02.768 --> 04:06.105
Everything in the cash register, Sam.
Freeze!

04:07.356 --> 04:10.526
Everybody just take it easy here. I'II...

04:10.693 --> 04:16.447
- No. Let the other guy get it.
- Ernie Pantusso. Call me Coach.

04:20.119 --> 04:22.871
- We've gotta help Sammy.
- What can we do?

04:23.038 --> 04:26.333
Maybe we can jump the guy.
He's not that big.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.753
The gun is big. The gun's definitely big.

04:29.920 --> 04:35.175
Maybe Diane could run in circles,
flapping her arms, and draw his fire.

04:39.304 --> 04:42.266
Stay out of this.
Me and Norm will handle it.

04:42.433 --> 04:46.478
- What do you want me to do?
- We gotta do something. Trust me.

04:46.645 --> 04:51.483
Statistics show 33% of the time
a guy will not use a gun if challenged.

04:51.650 --> 04:55.070
- So?
- If he's shot two people, you're in luck.

04:57.489 --> 05:02.161
Hey, folks. I hope no one's
going to try anything silly here.

05:02.327 --> 05:06.790
Take it easy. No one's going
to overpower you. It's not worth it.

05:07.833 --> 05:13.922
Not even if I was a little careless and
let the gun drop onto the bar like that.

05:14.840 --> 05:20.304
Maybe let my attention
wander round the room a little bit.

05:25.434 --> 05:27.477
Now!

05:32.274 --> 05:36.320
- It's OK. Carla's got him.
- Lucky for him.

05:38.488 --> 05:40.532
OK, Sam. You got me.

05:40.699 --> 05:43.911
- Watch where you point it.
- It isn't loaded.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.121
It isn't?

05:47.372 --> 05:49.249
It isn't!

05:49.416 --> 05:53.837
Cliffy, suppose
this little trickle here's noticeable?

05:54.004 --> 05:59.384
Would you come here and watch him?
I'll see if the police answer their phone.

05:59.551 --> 06:01.970
Good. I want to go back to prison.

06:02.137 --> 06:05.974
- I can't make it on the outside.
- Have you really tried?

06:06.141 --> 06:10.395
I've been beating my brains out.
No one will give me a break.

06:10.562 --> 06:15.859
- No one will hire me. No one trusts me.
- What are your skills?

06:16.026 --> 06:19.947
I have no skills. I'm worthless.

06:21.031 --> 06:24.785
Don't you have any ambitions,
any dreams?

06:25.786 --> 06:29.331
- You'd laugh if I told you.
- No, we won't.

06:31.541 --> 06:33.794
I'd love to be an actor.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.841
God bless you, Cliff.

06:40.008 --> 06:44.262
I did a little acting in high schooI.
I think I was pretty good.

06:44.429 --> 06:47.808
At least it was an escape
from so many things.

06:48.558 --> 06:51.395
So go and be an actor.
Why bellyache to us?

06:51.561 --> 06:54.189
Fat chance.
Nobody will even give me a look.

06:54.356 --> 06:59.611
I'm going back where I belong, out
of everybody's way. Prison is my home.

07:00.612 --> 07:03.865
- The cops are on their way.
- Tell them not to come.

07:04.032 --> 07:06.993
Go it. What? Why?

07:07.160 --> 07:10.205
Why am I doing that?

07:10.372 --> 07:15.544
When Andy shoved that gun
in your face, he was asking for help.

07:15.711 --> 07:18.797
Silly me.
I thought he was asking for money.

07:18.964 --> 07:23.927
He stands here as an embodiment
of the failure of our penaI system.

07:24.094 --> 07:30.976
This man doesn't belong in prison.
We, mostly I, can save this man's life.

07:32.519 --> 07:35.856
Well, how are we, mostly you,
going to do that?

07:36.022 --> 07:41.611
<i>Never mind that now.
Call off les gendarmes. Trust me.</i>

07:41.778 --> 07:44.406
What are you going to do now, Diane?

07:44.573 --> 07:49.286
Well, I happen to know
Professor Sebastian DeWitt,

07:49.453 --> 07:55.167
America's foremost drama coach.
He can spot an actor a mile away.

07:55.333 --> 07:58.628
That could come in handy at a drive-in.

08:04.759 --> 08:07.637
- OK, I called the cops off.
- Excellent.

08:07.804 --> 08:12.350
Andrew, listen to me.
Now, you want to be an actor.

08:12.517 --> 08:17.397
I have experience as a director
in schooI. We're going to do a scene...

08:17.564 --> 08:23.028
Later, Sam. Now, if I think
you're good enough, a very big if,

08:23.195 --> 08:28.200
but if you are, I will arrange for
Professor DeWitt to see you perform.

08:28.366 --> 08:31.620
He has contacts at every theatre
on the Cape.

08:32.703 --> 08:38.083
I never expected this when I came
in here to stick up your bar.

08:38.251 --> 08:42.589
You know the old saying.
Use a gun, go to Cape Cod.

08:48.178 --> 08:52.015
Why are you doing this for me
after our last experience?

08:53.099 --> 08:58.104
Well, I understand what people
in the acting world go through.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.024
I did a bit of acting myself in college.

09:01.191 --> 09:04.694
Really? You could be in my scene.
Were you good?

09:06.196 --> 09:10.450
Well, I don't like to brag,
but a lot of people love my work.

09:10.617 --> 09:14.371
At Bennington,
they still talk about my Tiny Alice.

09:14.537 --> 09:17.624
Who wants a girI with a big Alice?

09:20.752 --> 09:25.006
I know a book store that specialises
in theatricaI books.

09:25.173 --> 09:29.260
Let's pick up some plays.
Sam, may I have half an hour off?

09:30.637 --> 09:33.723
You're right. I need an hour.

09:33.890 --> 09:37.394
Diane, can I talk to you here
for a second, please?

09:38.478 --> 09:40.522
Excuse me.

09:42.857 --> 09:48.071
You thought he was Jack the Ripper.
Now you're going browsing with him?

09:49.155 --> 09:55.203
Now I know him. Sam, look at him.
Does he look like a dangerous person?

09:58.039 --> 10:01.292
- He has done time.
- He made one small mistake.

10:01.459 --> 10:04.796
He made a big one.
He's a murderer, Diane.

10:04.963 --> 10:08.216
One murder does not
a murderer make.

10:11.010 --> 10:14.347
OK, what I mean is,
he's not a murderer at heart.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.767
Anyone who loves the theatre
loves mankind.

10:17.934 --> 10:22.188
I don't think somebody
should go out with a crazy person.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.692
- I can take care of myself.
- I was talking about me.

10:29.362 --> 10:33.199
Hie, thee, Andrew. Let us away.

10:40.081 --> 10:44.878
I sense you are uneasy about your
employee being in danger with me.

10:46.963 --> 10:52.343
My crime occurred a long time ago.
I was a different person then.

10:52.510 --> 10:56.681
I had one terrible moment
of temporary insanity.

10:56.848 --> 10:59.809
I'm much better now.
I'm much healthier.

10:59.976 --> 11:03.688
I can't remember the last time
I heard those voices.

11:03.855 --> 11:07.233
Well, I'm glad. What voices?

11:07.400 --> 11:12.113
Those shrill voices
that used to sound like my...

11:13.531 --> 11:15.158
...mummy.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.953
I'm glad you got it licked.

11:20.538 --> 11:27.378
- Sam, please. Relax. I'm better now.
- Come along, Andrew.

11:30.632 --> 11:32.675
You thought...

11:34.093 --> 11:35.887
But it wasn't...

11:41.933 --> 11:47.397
A hard left covered by two quick jabs.
Another left. He stepped into that one.

11:47.564 --> 11:49.691
A left jab. A left upper cut.

11:49.858 --> 11:54.487
An overhead right across the forehead,
as they go into the corner.

11:54.654 --> 11:59.242
- And that's the end of round six.
- It's beer time, Sammy.

12:00.326 --> 12:03.872
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.
Good hands.

12:04.038 --> 12:06.958
Keep moving. Here we go.

12:07.125 --> 12:11.212
Slow it down. We only got
20 seconds, next commerciaI.

12:11.379 --> 12:14.257
That's it. Good hands. Here we go.

12:17.510 --> 12:21.347
There we go. All right. Come on.
Move along there.

12:21.514 --> 12:24.726
Come on. We got three left.
We got two left.

12:28.188 --> 12:32.192
Sammy, what does a guy have to do
to get a beer round here?

12:32.358 --> 12:36.571
This is the best middleweight contest
we've seen in a long time.

12:36.738 --> 12:38.865
Who would want to miss this?

12:39.032 --> 12:45.288
All right, boys, off, off. Andy and I can't
hear ourselves rehearsing back there.

12:45.455 --> 12:48.708
Professor DeWitt
will be here any minute.

12:54.005 --> 12:57.342
I hope she's showing you
one hell of a good time.

12:58.801 --> 13:01.888
Don't be nervous. You'll be wonderfuI.

13:02.055 --> 13:06.643
I'm not nervous. It's just this week
has gone by so quickly.

13:08.186 --> 13:10.813
It's been the best week of my life.

13:12.315 --> 13:15.735
- Miss Chambers.
- Professor, how good of you to come.

13:15.902 --> 13:20.365
This is Andrew Schroeder, a young
man who is going to surprise you.

13:20.532 --> 13:22.951
I hope so.

13:23.117 --> 13:28.456
When the theatre loses
its power to surprise, it loses vitality.

13:28.623 --> 13:31.417
- What first?
- A scene from "Othello".

13:31.584 --> 13:34.629
Challenging.

13:35.713 --> 13:42.345
It's certainly nice to see you again.
I could never picture you as a waitress.

13:42.512 --> 13:47.308
You forget I played a waitress
in your production of "Bus Stop".

13:47.475 --> 13:49.519
Yes, I know.

13:51.062 --> 13:53.481
Have fun. Break a leg.

13:58.903 --> 14:03.157
- I can't believe you did this for me.
- You deserve it.

14:04.242 --> 14:08.162
You're talented and sensitive.
You have a lot of depth.

14:09.205 --> 14:13.293
- You know me so well.
- I'm a pretty good judge of people.

14:13.459 --> 14:16.129
You are. You're wonderfuI.

14:18.589 --> 14:22.301
- I love you, Diane.
- I love you, too.

14:22.468 --> 14:25.430
You guys about ready?
Crowd's getting restless.

14:25.596 --> 14:31.019
If they don't hear some Elizabethan
couplets soon, they'll turn ugly.

14:31.185 --> 14:35.398
I'd better get into costume. Excuse me.

14:36.899 --> 14:42.280
All right. Listen up. You were right
about Andy. I was wrong.

14:42.447 --> 14:47.702
He's been a complete angeI all week.
My objections were stupid.

14:47.869 --> 14:50.788
- Are you satisfied?
- Of course.

14:50.955 --> 14:53.458
Put it in writing and we'll be fine.

14:53.624 --> 14:55.668
Fat chance.

14:55.835 --> 15:01.632
Sorry I haven't been around much this
week, but it was important to help Andy.

15:01.799 --> 15:03.926
It's been kind of tough.

15:05.762 --> 15:09.974
Well, later, when we're alone,

15:10.141 --> 15:14.896
- I'll make it up to you at my apartment.
- What time tonight?

15:22.403 --> 15:26.115
Let's get the show on the road.
Good luck.

15:31.829 --> 15:36.876
- Andy, what's the matter?
- You kissed him. I saw you.

15:37.043 --> 15:40.296
That's all right.
I guess it's no secret here.

15:40.463 --> 15:43.257
Sam and I have sort of a thing going.

15:45.051 --> 15:50.640
But I love you... and you said
you love me.

15:52.350 --> 15:54.393
Oh, dear.

15:56.145 --> 16:01.400
No, I was speaking as a friend, Andy.

16:03.194 --> 16:07.823
If I gave you any other impression,
I'm sorry. Really sorry.

16:08.991 --> 16:12.995
I do love you, as a friend. OK?

16:13.871 --> 16:15.831
Sure.

16:18.626 --> 16:21.045
- You're not upset?
- No.

16:21.212 --> 16:24.048
- You're not angry with me?
- That's OK.

16:25.132 --> 16:27.385
I'll use it in my performance.

16:33.474 --> 16:35.893
"Yet she must die...

16:38.062 --> 16:41.023
"... else she betray more men. "

16:41.190 --> 16:42.817
WonderfuI.

16:46.112 --> 16:48.948
That was perfect.

16:52.702 --> 16:54.912
"Put out the light

16:55.079 --> 17:00.251
"and then put out the light. "

17:00.418 --> 17:02.878
Andy, it's time. Are you ready?

17:07.383 --> 17:09.426
Show folk.

17:15.598 --> 17:20.646
Good evening, everyone,
and welcome to talent night at Cheers.

17:24.858 --> 17:30.406
This evening we begin with a scene
from William Shakespeare's "Othello".

17:30.573 --> 17:34.201
I don't have to explain the play
to Professor DeWitt.

17:36.078 --> 17:41.500
But it might be helpfuI to some of you
if I explain what you are about to see.

17:41.667 --> 17:45.171
I wonder who she's talking about,
Norm.

17:51.135 --> 17:57.308
In this play, Andrew Schroeder, my
discovery, will enact the role of Othello.

17:57.475 --> 17:59.518
Go, Andy!

18:03.939 --> 18:07.943
This is the story of a man,
driven by insane jealousy,

18:08.110 --> 18:14.366
to murder the woman he loves because
he believes she loves another man.

18:21.582 --> 18:23.626
The scene we are about to do

18:23.793 --> 18:29.048
is the scene in which Othello
actually kills said woman,

18:29.215 --> 18:32.301
who will be portrayed by myself.

18:37.807 --> 18:41.560
Did I mention
that I'm playing Desdemona?

18:41.727 --> 18:46.941
OK, so without further ado, the strang...

18:49.443 --> 18:52.696
...the strangulation scene.

18:55.366 --> 19:00.371
But before we do, let's have
a little background on the 16th Century.

19:00.538 --> 19:02.581
Come on, Diane.

19:03.999 --> 19:07.086
No more background.
Let's have the scene.

19:07.253 --> 19:12.508
- Don't worry. Let me give you a kiss.
- Don't touch me. I barely know you!

19:15.803 --> 19:18.889
All right. On with the play.

19:20.349 --> 19:23.269
In this scene, Desdemona is in bed,

19:23.435 --> 19:28.440
when Othello comes in, thinking,
very mistakenly, I can assure you...

19:28.607 --> 19:33.654
He's completely off-base on this one.
He'll be sick about it in the morning.

19:35.656 --> 19:39.994
Thinking that she has been
unfaithfuI to him.

19:42.246 --> 19:44.665
Which, of course, she hasn't.

20:07.938 --> 20:10.024
It is the cause.

20:11.108 --> 20:13.861
It is the cause, my souI.

20:15.029 --> 20:19.658
Let me not name it to you,
you chaste stars.

20:20.743 --> 20:22.786
It is the cause.

20:25.372 --> 20:28.959
Yet I'll not shed her blood,

20:29.126 --> 20:33.422
nor scar that whiter skin
of hers than snow.

20:33.589 --> 20:35.632
There. Good.

20:37.801 --> 20:42.556
Well, it's agreed. No blood, no scarring,
the gist of our scene.

20:42.723 --> 20:44.433
Oh, come on, Diane!

20:46.977 --> 20:51.023
- What's wrong with Diane tonight?
- She got stage fright.

20:51.190 --> 20:55.277
Diane, the sooner you start,
the sooner you'll be finished.

21:14.296 --> 21:17.716
Who's there? Othello?

21:19.802 --> 21:22.638
Aye, Desdemona.

21:26.183 --> 21:28.227
Will you come to bed, my lord?

21:32.147 --> 21:36.568
Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona?

21:36.735 --> 21:41.990
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit.

21:45.536 --> 21:49.790
Talk... Talk you of killing?

21:50.874 --> 21:53.168
Aye. I do.

21:53.335 --> 21:58.090
He's convincing. There's
a reaI murderous intensity about him.

21:58.257 --> 22:01.844
Then heaven have mercy on me.

22:02.010 --> 22:05.180
Think on thy sins.

22:05.347 --> 22:09.017
- Are you sure she's OK?
- Sure. She's just acting.

22:10.686 --> 22:15.941
- Shouldn't you make sure?
- Imagine what she'd say if I butted in.

22:16.108 --> 22:20.863
Take heed of perjury.
Thou art on thy deathbed!

22:23.198 --> 22:25.826
I love it! A Desdemona that fights back!

22:29.872 --> 22:32.207
Help! This psycho's trying to kill me!

22:32.374 --> 22:36.378
That's the only line of Shakespeare
I ever understood.

22:36.545 --> 22:40.632
I saw you kissing Sam!

22:40.799 --> 22:42.843
Kissing Sam?

22:44.595 --> 22:47.598
- Someone help me, will you?
- Mummy!

22:47.764 --> 22:50.392
I'll clean up my room, Mummy!

23:02.112 --> 23:04.364
What time's the second show?

23:08.535 --> 23:12.664
I hope you fry for this.

23:14.499 --> 23:16.752
Are you going to be OK?

23:18.420 --> 23:24.259
- I'm having a little trouble breathing.
- No, I meant for tonight.

24:01.963 --> 24:02.964
English

24:03.305 --> 24:09.881
