WEBVTT

00:45.012 --> 00:47.248
You know, this whole time
with Grace,

00:47.348 --> 00:48.916
I've mostly been working
from home.

00:49.016 --> 00:51.419
But now that I'm gonna
stick around, I had an idea

00:51.519 --> 00:54.188
about where I'm going
to hang my hat.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.889
Okay, so if this your way

00:55.989 --> 00:58.192
of trying to get
a piece of my office...

00:58.292 --> 01:00.761
No.
I was thinking something...

01:00.861 --> 01:03.331
a little cozier.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.801
You want a locker near Penny's.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.770
Just a place to stash my kit.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.539
And...

01:11.639 --> 01:14.242
maybe get in her ear
a little bit.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.510
You two do get along, don't you?

01:16.610 --> 01:18.179
She reminds me of someone.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.513
I love that.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.149
You know,
back when I was coaching,

01:21.249 --> 01:23.484
I used to pair the freshmen
with the seniors and just...

01:23.584 --> 01:25.153
watch 'em grow.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.854
Senior?

01:26.954 --> 01:27.955
Okay.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.390
Careful.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.691
You know, just yesterday
I taught Penny and Beau

01:30.791 --> 01:32.326
how to make queso
with a blowtorch.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.296
You ask me, they're already
getting quality mentorship.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.132
You do have a murder

01:38.232 --> 01:40.100
that needs to be investigated,
don't you, Joshua?

01:40.201 --> 01:41.902
I'm going.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.809
Allie! I didn't think
I'd see you here.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.878
You've got your level 3 exam
on Friday, don't you?

01:50.978 --> 01:54.014
I thought you'd be, uh,
taking a few days off to cram.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.750
Indeed, it would be wise
to do so, Mr. Folsom.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.052
But the untimely demise

01:59.153 --> 02:01.121
of Lady Fanny Prince
is not a matter

02:01.222 --> 02:02.856
that will resolve itself.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.426
I'm sorry, did we just step
through a portal to 1812?

02:05.526 --> 02:06.994
That's Lady who now?

02:07.094 --> 02:09.797
Don't worry about it.
Her real name is Shelby Winslow.

02:09.897 --> 02:13.267
She's part of a little festival
up at the hotel there.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.836
Regency Romantics Weekend.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.571
There's a few dozen
other ladies and gentlemen

02:17.671 --> 02:20.040
dudded up in the ballroom.
Looks like a hoot.

02:21.309 --> 02:24.245
Well, not anymore.
May I?

02:24.345 --> 02:26.247
Jack released the body.
Go for it.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.148
What happened?

02:28.249 --> 02:30.818
What, she get Alexander
Hamilton-ed in a duel?

02:30.918 --> 02:33.621
No, footprints show her
running for her life,

02:33.721 --> 02:36.324
all the way from inside.
She must have slipped

02:36.424 --> 02:37.825
and the killer caught up.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.527
I'm shocked
she made it this far.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.862
It's really hard
to sprint in a corset.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.064
Well.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.735
Any witnesses?

02:47.835 --> 02:50.404
Not exactly. The groundskeeper
heard the gunshot.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.373
Actually, he was the one
who called it in.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.908
Any chance he's our Aaron Burr?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.110
No, his hands
tested negative for GSR.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.647
And he wears size 14s.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.282
These prints are ten and a half.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.016
I'll tell you what else
doesn't fit. How is her head

03:03.116 --> 03:05.219
still in one piece?
I mean, that caliber--

03:05.319 --> 03:07.187
serious business.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.290
Yeah, and look.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.892
There's no exit wound, either.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.527
Huh.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.862
Well, how up to date
do you think

03:14.962 --> 03:16.964
our ballistics lab is
on musket balls?

03:17.064 --> 03:19.199
I know it sounds
weird, but, I mean,

03:19.300 --> 03:20.568
w-what else explains
what we're looking at here?

03:20.668 --> 03:23.237
I suppose.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.938
Mm, smaller powder load,

03:25.038 --> 03:27.140
less velocity, unrifled barrel?

03:27.241 --> 03:28.676
Maybe a flintlock?

03:36.183 --> 03:37.885
He would have
had to have been close.

03:41.121 --> 03:44.325
I think he was
really close.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.893
Short and coarse.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.095
Pretty sure she yanked this out
of somebody's beard.

03:48.195 --> 03:51.565
Nicely done, Lady Fanny.
She put up a fight.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.734
So up close and personal.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.203
I wonder if they
knew each other.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.871
This is weird. Uh...

03:57.971 --> 04:00.107
I think there's some sort
of chemical interference.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.142
The mold isn't
setting properly.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.980
Smells like chlorine bleach.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.982
Huh. Well, who takes
the time to bleach

04:09.082 --> 04:11.084
their crime scene but doesn't
rake over his footprints?

04:11.184 --> 04:13.120
I don't think he brought it
down here to clean up.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.122
He might have
tracked it with him.

04:15.222 --> 04:17.291
I hear the other scene
is saturated with the stuff.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.493
There's another crime scene?
Mm. And another victim.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.829
Cops are keeping
the whole place locked down.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.564
Chavez took Beau up there
to get started.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.898
If you can help Penny,

04:24.998 --> 04:26.066
I'm gonna go take a look myself.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.336
All right, well,
keep an eye out

04:28.436 --> 04:30.671
for any gentlemen who's
missing a chunk of beard.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.976
Tell me, CSI Rajan,

04:36.076 --> 04:38.579
what items need to be
impounded separately

04:38.679 --> 04:40.814
from other items
as evidence?

04:40.914 --> 04:42.950
Don't tell me
Folsom's roped you

04:43.050 --> 04:44.952
into playing
<i>University Challenge,</i> too.

04:45.052 --> 04:48.322
I'm going to assume that's,
like, a crappy British <i>Jeopardy!</i>

04:54.127 --> 04:55.729
For what it's
worth, I told him

04:55.829 --> 04:57.531
if anyone's got that
test handled, it's you.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.733
Hm. Thank you.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.503
It's nice of you to help.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.405
It's all Josh.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.807
You know him: he's invested.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.079
Okay.

05:12.179 --> 05:16.617
Meet Clarence Mosley.
37, Libra, organ donor.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.952
In town from Santa Fe.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.391
Huh. According
to his driver's license photo,

05:23.491 --> 05:25.393
the hole in his head is new.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.194
Dinner was being served
next door, this place was empty.

05:27.294 --> 05:30.163
Nobody heard a thing, apparently.

05:30.263 --> 05:33.701
It's consistent with
the wound on our other victim.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.069
So, the tread of these shoes

05:36.169 --> 05:39.039
is identical to the footprints
we found in the sand trap.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.841
Same triggerman?
Mm-hmm.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.776
And I'm pretty sure
they struck here first.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.011
What makes you think that?

05:44.111 --> 05:45.779
Well, there's no trace
of dirt or sand.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.080
They would have
tracked it with them.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.682
Yeah, biggest regret
of my life was

05:48.782 --> 05:50.584
buying my kids a sandbox.
You wouldn't believe

05:50.684 --> 05:52.319
where you find that stuff.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.321
Guys.

05:54.422 --> 05:56.990
You're gonna want to see this.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.530
Murder in black and white.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.964
But not the murderer.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.866
They say a picture's
worth a thousand words.

06:05.966 --> 06:09.036
Mm, but this one
isn't saying enough.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.718

Hey.
Hey, Max.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.082
How you do...

06:55.182 --> 06:57.350
Hang on a... hang on a sec.

06:57.451 --> 07:00.320
You ever see little
powder marks like this?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.690
Yeah, but only once.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.025
Same marks are on the lady
I just pulled

07:05.125 --> 07:08.529
out of the sand trap.
What kind of gun leaves those?

07:08.629 --> 07:11.164
Maybe one with
a damaged barrel.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.635
Allie was hoping we'd
get some ideas, but all you can

07:14.735 --> 07:17.571
really see is the murderous
bulge behind the curtain.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.440
"A murderous bulge,"
that's probably something

07:20.541 --> 07:22.109
we don't want
to say again, huh?

07:22.209 --> 07:23.744
One other thing.

07:23.844 --> 07:27.515
There's this crusty schmutz
around the bullet hole.

07:27.615 --> 07:28.782
Schmutz?

07:28.882 --> 07:29.950
It's a technical term.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.820
It looks organic.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.355
Gonna be curious to see what
GCMS has to say about this.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.525
Wait, you think
the murder weapon left that?

07:37.625 --> 07:39.927
Yeah, I got to
think so, right?

07:41.428 --> 07:43.964
<i>Maybe the muzzle of the gun</i>

07:44.064 --> 07:47.034
<i>left that trace there
before the trigger was pulled.</i>

07:48.969 --> 07:51.404
If the killer was
shooting blind,

07:51.505 --> 07:53.541
I wonder if he even knew
that Shelby was in there.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.408
You think Clarence
was the main target?

07:55.509 --> 07:56.777
I don't know.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.646
It might explain how she
had all that time to run

07:58.746 --> 08:00.347
all the way down to
the 17th fairway.

08:00.447 --> 08:02.415
Right?
Wonder what the motive was--

08:02.516 --> 08:04.518
somebody cut in line
for rum punch?

08:04.618 --> 08:06.554
A croquet rivalry gone too far?

08:06.654 --> 08:09.857
Okay, we got two dead bodies and
a conference full of suspects.

08:09.957 --> 08:13.360
All right, time to start
swabbing for GSR.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.996
<i>How dare you, madam.</i>

08:16.096 --> 08:17.665
Implying I'm a suspect.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.533
It's an affront to my good name.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.834
Mrs. Perlmutter,
we're actually

08:20.934 --> 08:22.369
trying to exclude
you as a suspect.

08:22.469 --> 08:23.971
This is an absurd inconvenience.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.073
I still have a conference
to organize, you know.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.776
So Prudence Perlmutter
is your real name?

08:28.876 --> 08:30.110
Of course.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.813
Why would I adopt
a false identity?

08:33.581 --> 08:35.549
Shelby Winslow,

08:35.649 --> 08:38.018
she was going as
Lady Fanny Prince.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.954
Shelby never had the proper
respect for the classics.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.591
She preferred
those déclassé bodice-rippers

08:43.691 --> 08:45.693
to Jane's exquisite prose.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.895
Brontës were more my jam.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.564
Everybody's got their thing, right?

08:50.664 --> 08:52.566
Regency Romantics Weekend
used to be

08:52.666 --> 08:55.202
a refined appreciation
of a bygone era.

08:55.302 --> 08:56.770
And what is it now?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.739
It's been usurped
by young people

08:58.839 --> 09:01.609
indulging in their
tawdry fantasies.

09:02.576 --> 09:05.178
Like Shelby
and that debauched rake,

09:05.278 --> 09:06.614
Clarence Mosley.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.849
Too much flirting for you?

09:08.949 --> 09:12.419
If only it were limited
to flirtation.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.422
Shelby Winslow was married.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.959
Clarence knew
and didn't give a damn.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.528
You ought to talk
to Mr. Winslow.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.997
The cuckolded husband.

09:24.097 --> 09:27.067
Certainly seems like a
prime suspect to me, Inspector.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.636
It's detective.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.841
And we will. You're free
to go, Mrs. Perlmutter.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.575
Indeed.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.379
Hm.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.282
Do you like her theory?

09:42.382 --> 09:44.384
The cuckolded husband?

09:44.484 --> 09:45.886
Why not?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.154
I mean,
the rest of these dandies can

09:47.254 --> 09:48.421
all alibi each other.

09:48.521 --> 09:49.857
Hmm.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.192
Love makes people
do crazy things.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.094
Anti-psychotics.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.664
Uh, the analysis of the beard
hair in Shelby Winslow's fist

09:56.764 --> 09:59.566
shows the killer
was on haloperidol.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.468
At least, sometimes.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.336
He went off his meds?

10:03.436 --> 10:05.773
LC-MS shows that
there was a ton of it

10:05.873 --> 10:07.641
in the bottom two-thirds
of the hair,

10:07.741 --> 10:11.344
but not in the 8.6 millimeters
near the root.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.614
Sample is about an inch.

10:14.715 --> 10:18.085
Beard hair grows less
than half a millimeter a day,

10:18.185 --> 10:19.753
which means...

10:19.853 --> 10:21.454
it's about three months
of growth?

10:21.554 --> 10:23.523
So he stopped treatment

10:23.623 --> 10:25.726
about four weeks ago.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.261
We're looking for
an erratic bearded man.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.864
Where are we ever gonna
find one of those in Vegas?

10:30.964 --> 10:33.066
I might be able
to get us closer.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.435
That, uh, crusty trace
we rubbed off the murder weapon?

10:35.535 --> 10:37.304
It's grackle scat.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.907
Remind me of what a grackle is.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.909
Oh, it's a blackbird.
They're all over Vegas.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.744
Like pigeons,
only Halloweenier.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.612
Do you know what they call
a group of grackles?

10:45.713 --> 10:47.647
A plague.
Murder of crows,

10:47.748 --> 10:49.649
conspiracy of ravens,
a plague of grackles.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.885
My favorite
is a parliament of owls.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.221
I like preponderance
of evidence.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.723
How does this help?

10:55.823 --> 10:57.590
GC/MS found traces
of agave, yucca,

10:57.691 --> 10:59.993
desert kangaroo rat,
and a whole lot of corn.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.695
Sounds like
your keto diet.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.563
Well, I'm hoping
this particular menu

11:03.663 --> 11:05.132
can serve as a sort
of geographic fingerprint.

11:05.232 --> 11:08.368
You think it's distinct enough
to narrow down a search area?

11:08.468 --> 11:09.669
Well, the good thing
about grackles is

11:09.770 --> 11:11.271
they're homebodies
this time of year.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.973
They stay around wherever food
is plentiful. The murder weapon

11:13.073 --> 11:15.242
had to be around the birds
long enough to get crapped on.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.078
I've never heard of using bird
poop to solve a crime before.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.181
If we match a plague of grackles
to the mix of food

11:21.281 --> 11:23.550
in our sample...
You might get a general idea

11:23.650 --> 11:25.152
of where the murder weapon's
been hanging out.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.387
Uh, animal control can
help me catch some grackles

11:27.487 --> 11:29.156
around the city.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.258
Sure, collect scat samples

11:31.358 --> 11:33.460
from different neighborhoods
and we might

11:33.560 --> 11:35.462
be able to match
our crime scene sample.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.330
Proof's in the poop.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.267
We hope.
Yes, we do.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.980
Yeah.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.715
That's Shelby.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.484
You don't seem
that torn up

11:57.584 --> 11:58.718
about your wife's
death, Mr. Winslow.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.587
She was cheating on me.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.555
Did you know that?

12:03.957 --> 12:06.193
I thought if I went to that...

12:06.293 --> 12:10.998
dorky costume party
she might cool it, but no.

12:11.098 --> 12:14.267
She and Clarence
were right out in the open.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.771
I'm gonna need
to see your shoes.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.514
Ten and a halfs.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.149
Yeah, so?

12:34.454 --> 12:36.589
Same size
as the killer.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.427
There's no sand here, though.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.862
And it's a different tread.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.696
Did you shave
this morning?

12:43.797 --> 12:45.966
I shave every morning.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.802
Where were you last night
at 9:00, Mr. Winslow?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.170
Nobody at the Regency event

12:50.270 --> 12:51.538
remembers seeing you
after cocktail hour.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.473
Shelby and Clarence

12:53.573 --> 12:54.908
looked like
they were gonna knock

12:55.008 --> 12:57.410
the tea and crumpets
off the table and go at it.

12:57.510 --> 12:58.778
So I went to The Eclipse.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.447
Lost a grand
on the Raiders game.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.749
Anyone go with you?
No.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.886
But... here.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.956
Look, I know how it is.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.825
Husband's always
the first suspect.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.427
A lot of times,
husband's guilty.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.797
Look.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.732
I didn't like that
she was sneaking around

13:19.833 --> 13:21.568
with a guy in a powdered wig.

13:21.668 --> 13:24.004
But I didn't shoot my wife.

13:32.245 --> 13:35.782
Okay. I'm starting to think
this guy didn't shoot his wife.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.684
What makes you say that?

13:37.784 --> 13:39.219
Well, for one, neither

13:39.319 --> 13:41.354
of these victims have
a bullet in their head.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.925
As in, the killer fished it out?

13:45.025 --> 13:48.795
As in, I'm not convinced there
ever was a bullet to begin with.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.700
All I found in the wound tracts
were bone chips.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.803
And very small traces

13:56.904 --> 13:59.506
of... Okay.

13:59.606 --> 14:03.376
I think this is avian
fecal matter on the chips.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.645
The guy who was indoors
had more of it, actually.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.316
You don't look surprised.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.551
The murder weapon left traces

14:11.651 --> 14:14.654
of bird poop on the curtain
where Mr. Mosley was shot.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.723
It is strange, though.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.658
I mean, excrement being
inside the wounds,

14:18.758 --> 14:20.193
not just around them.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.729
And then there are
these powder burns.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.398
Shelby has the same marks.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.001
What kind of a gun does that?

14:28.101 --> 14:31.004
What if it wasn't a gun
at all? I mean, look

14:31.104 --> 14:34.374
at the characteristics
of the wound canal. Something

14:34.474 --> 14:37.244
both penetrated and was
removed from the wound.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.711
Penetrating trauma

14:38.811 --> 14:40.948
at a consistent depth
in both victims.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.584
Something like this
could have done it.

14:44.684 --> 14:48.288
A captive bolt pistol.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.792
And there would be
no projectile.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.195
Yeah, a weapon like
that would eject a rod

14:55.295 --> 14:58.665
at high speed into
the victim's brain.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.533
And that would explain
the fecal trace

15:00.633 --> 15:02.135
and that brain matter transfer.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.838
Because the same bolt was
used in both victims' heads.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.807
A bolt gun.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.709
Isn't that something
they use on livestock?

15:09.809 --> 15:12.445
Our killer had a different kind

15:12.545 --> 15:14.214
of slaughter in mind.

15:24.491 --> 15:27.327
Hey, take him! Take him!

15:27.427 --> 15:29.262
No! No!

15:39.506 --> 15:42.109
Detective Castricone gave me
the heads-up on this one.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.077
Said the M.O. looked like
our photo booth couple.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.380
Yep. Looks like a bolt gun
was used to blow the lock.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.182
Yeah, it did
this, too.

15:52.519 --> 15:53.753
Wait.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.422
We know him.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.492
Is that Lamont Moore?

16:00.860 --> 16:02.262
<i>Uh, I can't believe this.</i>

16:02.362 --> 16:04.431
<i>I-I chased a killer out
of this guy's house.</i>

16:04.531 --> 16:06.433
Stop!

16:06.533 --> 16:07.634
<i>Alan Herskovitz.</i>

16:07.734 --> 16:08.735
Yeah, but that
makes no sense.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.203
Herskovitz was crazy.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.504
He heard voices.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.140
Why would someone else
want Lamont dead?

16:13.240 --> 16:15.842
Hard to see how this connects
to anything. I-I mean,

16:15.942 --> 16:17.210
I can't picture
Lamont hanging out

16:17.310 --> 16:18.811
with the Jane Austen
Time Travel Society.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.113
I have a hard time believing

16:20.213 --> 16:21.448
he's just the unluckiest dude
in Vegas.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.750
So, must be something
we're missing.

16:28.921 --> 16:32.959
Tonight, a third homicide victim
has been discovered downtown.

16:33.060 --> 16:36.096
With no suspects yet identified,
some are asking,

16:36.196 --> 16:39.466
is there a serial killer
active in Las Vegas?

16:39.566 --> 16:40.867
A Las Vegas PD spokesperson

16:40.967 --> 16:43.970
declined to comment
on the status...

16:50.077 --> 16:52.179
Got to be the same killer.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.047
How many
bolt gun-carrying weirdos

16:54.147 --> 16:55.648
could be running around Vegas?

16:55.748 --> 17:00.120
Mm. This motel is a long way
from <i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

17:00.220 --> 17:01.654
What would bring
the killer here?

17:01.754 --> 17:04.457
Lamont's landlord said
he hasn't been home in weeks.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.559
Well, maybe he knew
he was being hunted.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.428
He came here to hide?

17:08.528 --> 17:10.963
This does have a vibe
of a place you go to lay low.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.400
Well, not you. You'd find
a place with a minibar

17:13.500 --> 17:15.468
and you'd pack a
lot more shoes.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.699
<i>He had a ton of cash</i>

17:46.799 --> 17:48.901
<i>and was staying here
under an assumed name.</i>

17:49.001 --> 17:51.171
Lamont really was trying
to stay off the grid.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.539
Mm.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.807
Speaking of grids,
pop quiz:

17:54.907 --> 17:57.444
can you tell me how the
grid search method differs

17:57.544 --> 17:59.179
from the strip and
spiral search methods?

17:59.279 --> 18:01.214
Terrific segue.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.982
Mm.
Very natural.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.419
You really want to do this now?

18:06.519 --> 18:09.156
That level 3 test
is no joke, Al.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.023
Written exam, the oral boards,

18:11.124 --> 18:12.359
the-the practical scene--

18:12.459 --> 18:14.661
it will kick your ass
if you're not ready.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.296
You don't want
to have to take it twice.

18:18.064 --> 18:21.434
The grid search provides
double coverage of the area.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.436
I know the handbook.
I'm ready.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.971
Hey.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.907
Look what was on the dash
of Lamont's truck out there.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.810
Amaranth Hotel.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.547
That's the same place they held
the Regency Romantics Weekend.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.216
Looks like we've got
a connection.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.518
I'm gonna go speak to the
manager if you two want to join.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.620
Um, no.
You two can go up.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.990
I'll stay here and practice
my grid searching.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.596
You know, I always thought
Lamont was a little sketchy.

18:49.696 --> 18:50.963
Is he, like, your prime suspect?

18:51.063 --> 18:53.233
We are looking
at a potential link.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.034
Actually, I...
He's been out of work for weeks

18:55.134 --> 18:57.036
with "COVID." Just got back
to work four days ago.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.005
But he's so unreliable,
I wish he'd just stayed away.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.374
Well, you're in luck, Mr. Smith.
Hmm?

19:01.474 --> 19:02.909
Lamont's another victim.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.611
He's...

19:04.711 --> 19:06.346
Wow.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.914
You good?
Yeah.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.350
I think I know
where our bleach came from.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.684
Oh.

19:11.784 --> 19:12.985
Fumes are intense here.

19:13.085 --> 19:15.922
I think luminol
can show us the way.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.858
It loves bleach as much as it
loves blood. Do you know why?

19:18.958 --> 19:20.827
You are not quizzing me, dude.
Keep spritzing.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.895
All right, hit
the lights for me.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.738
Hey.

19:32.705 --> 19:33.906
Where's this door go?

19:34.006 --> 19:36.075
That's the Earl Grey
Banquet Hall down there.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.944
That's where we
found Clarence.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.413
<i>So, the killer engages
Lamont here.</i>

19:41.047 --> 19:43.683
<i>Lamont defends himself.</i>

19:44.451 --> 19:46.219
<i>Both men are covered in bleach.</i>

19:46.319 --> 19:49.656
<i>But Lamont gets away.</i>

19:49.756 --> 19:51.324
<i>Killer lags behind,</i>

19:51.424 --> 19:53.125
<i>follows him.</i>

19:53.226 --> 19:56.396
Then somehow Clarence
is the one who gets killed. Why?

19:56.496 --> 19:58.665
I don't
know, boss.

19:58.765 --> 20:01.701
Maybe... wrong
place, wrong time?

20:01.801 --> 20:04.304
Maybe wrong face, wrong time.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.907
Clarence Mosley and Lamont Moore
could almost be cousins.

20:08.007 --> 20:11.411
Do you think this is a case
of mistaken identity?

20:11.511 --> 20:14.381
I mean, the killer did just
get splashed with bleach.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.015
Maybe some got in his eyes.

20:18.318 --> 20:21.388
<i>If he lost sight of Lamont
and sees a guy</i>

20:21.488 --> 20:24.291
<i>that looks like him
duck into a photo booth...
He never gets</i>

20:24.391 --> 20:26.293
<i>a clear look at the guy
that he's killing</i>

20:26.393 --> 20:27.627
<i>through the curtain.
He might not have even known</i>

20:27.727 --> 20:29.462
<i>that Shelby was in there, too.</i>

20:30.096 --> 20:32.765
<i>And once Shelby ducks
out of the photo booth,</i>

20:32.865 --> 20:34.434
<i>he realizes the mistake</i>

20:34.534 --> 20:37.704
<i>and then he's chasing a witness
down the 17th fairway,</i>

20:37.804 --> 20:39.539
<i>puts her down...</i>

20:40.407 --> 20:42.642
<i>...but leaves
a piece of himself behind.</i>

20:42.742 --> 20:44.611
<i>But he's still oh for two,
so he gets</i>

20:44.711 --> 20:45.845
<i>Lamont's address
from a work ID,</i>

20:45.945 --> 20:48.180
<i>tracks him down
at a hotel room,</i>

20:48.281 --> 20:49.449
<i>finishes the job.</i>

20:49.549 --> 20:51.351
This killer's made
a real hash of this.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.685
He still got his
man in the end.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.421
I'll tell you one thing.
Hmm?

20:54.521 --> 20:56.155
Clarence might not have
been the intended target,

20:56.255 --> 20:57.724
Mm-hmm.
but our best lead's
from his scene.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.926
Which evidence is that?

21:00.026 --> 21:00.927
The poop.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.263
The poop.

21:17.410 --> 21:20.112
Oh, you are a handsome fella,
aren't you? Yeah.

21:20.212 --> 21:23.316
Even if you have been eating
rancid fried chicken.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.320
Don't you want
to get to know our guests?

21:27.420 --> 21:30.323
I'm good. I appreciate
wildlife from a distance.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.392
Ooh. Hey.

21:32.492 --> 21:33.993
Hmm.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.262
Your friends tell us
anything useful?

21:36.363 --> 21:37.630
Yes and no.
I mean,

21:37.730 --> 21:39.566
everybody's stool
sample contained

21:39.666 --> 21:41.167
elements of
the magic mix.

21:41.267 --> 21:42.969
Agave. Little bit
of yucca mixed in.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.270
That goes for most of
'em. But none of 'em

21:44.371 --> 21:45.572
are even close to
the perfect match.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.640
So we haven't
ID'ed our killer's

21:47.740 --> 21:49.376
geographic fingerprint.

21:49.476 --> 21:50.843
I couldn't even swear
the trace left by the gun

21:50.943 --> 21:51.978
was from a bird in Nevada.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.079
Thinking of
going broader.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.347
You know?
More grackles,

21:54.447 --> 21:55.548
more samples.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.549
Uh-huh.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.585
Before you do, Penny,

21:58.685 --> 22:00.653
what are you thinking
and not saying?

22:01.454 --> 22:03.222
Oh. No, it's-it's nothing.
It's just...

22:03.322 --> 22:04.891
It's-it's a hunch.
It's not based on

22:04.991 --> 22:07.059
anything concrete.
Spit it out.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.396
Corn.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.265
Everything else
in the droppings from the scene

22:13.366 --> 22:14.667
is from a desert ecosystem.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.003
Agave, yucca,
kangaroo rat. Right.

22:17.103 --> 22:20.072
But the scat at the scene
is almost half corn.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.041
Where would
a grackle

22:22.141 --> 22:24.744
have access to that quantity
of corn around here?

22:24.844 --> 22:26.278
Our murder weapon, the bolt gun,

22:26.379 --> 22:29.516
is usually used
as a cattle stunner. Could be...

22:29.616 --> 22:30.683
livestock feed?

22:30.783 --> 22:33.152
You know, in a
previous life,

22:33.252 --> 22:36.556
I knew the GMO guys making
herbicide-resistant crops.

22:36.656 --> 22:39.125
A lot of corn-based
feed in GMOs.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.260
Corporations, they patent
the chemical makeup.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.595
It's easy to identify.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.798
Well, a microarray
from the MiSeq FGx

22:45.898 --> 22:47.066
could give us
the exact variety of the corn.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.735
We can match it
to the GMO product.

22:48.835 --> 22:51.370
Good thinking, Penny.

22:54.407 --> 22:56.676
Oh! Gah! Scared the
crap out of 'em.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.210
Just means more samples.

22:58.310 --> 22:59.278
Way to go, boss.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.947
Nicely done.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.815
You hear about
our third victim?

23:02.915 --> 23:04.383
Our old pal Lamont Moore?

23:04.484 --> 23:07.053
Yeah. This is the second time
somebody came after this guy.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.188
Lamont's not the
president of Honduras.

23:09.288 --> 23:11.257
Why do people keep trying
to assassinate him?

23:11.357 --> 23:13.159
You know, maybe we should talk
to the first guy

23:13.259 --> 23:14.160
who came after him.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.495
Alan Herskovitz.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.764
It's all by design!

23:17.864 --> 23:19.365
<i>He'll be medicated now.</i>

23:19.466 --> 23:22.301
Might be willing to fill in
some more blanks for us.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.671
Maybe you could call
your guys at the NDOC,

23:24.771 --> 23:26.806
see if we can talk
to their newest patient?

23:26.906 --> 23:29.408
Better than dealing
with that crap.

23:33.546 --> 23:36.516
Ah. Looks like you're
about to close up shop.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.850
How can I help?

23:37.950 --> 23:39.519
I've already dusted for prints.

23:39.619 --> 23:42.321
Housekeeping is much better
than you'd think.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.257
I only found one set of prints.
Probably Lamont's.

23:45.357 --> 23:47.760
Well, you've bagged everything
there is to bag.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.328
What's left?

23:49.428 --> 23:51.464
Saved the best till last.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.199
Luminol.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.336
Huh.
Just Lamont's shoe prints.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.438
None of the killer's.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.773
Hey, uh, Al.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.209
Hmm?
Question.

24:03.309 --> 24:05.344
What do the letters R.A.M.
stand for?

24:05.444 --> 24:06.946
I'm not doing
trivia with you.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.881
If you don't know,
you can just say.

24:08.981 --> 24:11.618
Rhodamine 6G,
Ardrox and MBD.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.620
Say the long version.
You say the long version.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.321
I've passed
the test.

24:15.421 --> 24:17.156
Rhodamine 6G,

24:17.256 --> 24:20.960
Ardrox and seven
p-Methoxybenzylamine,

24:21.060 --> 24:24.430
four nitrobenz, two
oxa, 1,3 diazole.

24:24.531 --> 24:25.832
Happy?

24:25.932 --> 24:27.634
Okay, now draw it.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.468
Seriously?

24:31.170 --> 24:33.806
Wait. He walked
into the tub?

24:40.580 --> 24:41.581
Whoa.

24:41.681 --> 24:42.949
Buddy.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.751
Mm.
I've heard of
shower shoes,

24:44.851 --> 24:47.353
but come on, man.
Hold on.

24:48.755 --> 24:49.989
What's that?

24:51.558 --> 24:54.861
Someone's unscrewed
this recently.

25:01.267 --> 25:04.070
There's something tied to this.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.874
Careful.

25:26.726 --> 25:27.627
Max.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.328
Thank you. Yes.

25:29.428 --> 25:31.263
Lamont Moore
wasn't just a victim.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.531
He was supposed
to be a killer, too.

25:32.632 --> 25:33.800
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.668
What are you guys talking about?

25:35.768 --> 25:37.236
Lamont Moore
was being blackmailed.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.005
We found this dossier hidden
in Lamont's motel room.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.073
And somebody wanted him
to commit a murder.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.375
Who was Lamont supposed to kill?

25:43.475 --> 25:44.376
That's what's

25:44.476 --> 25:45.578
really crazy.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.313
Somebody else
we've met recently.

25:47.413 --> 25:50.049
Albert Santoni,
aka Peter Nesicolacci.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.383
The guy who killed that chef.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.552
And it's not just Lamont.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.087
At least three cases
we've worked on

25:55.187 --> 25:57.123
in the last few weeks--

25:57.223 --> 25:58.691
they're all connected.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.501
These are our players.

26:09.602 --> 26:10.502
At least the ones we know.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.304
Now, all of these cases,

26:12.404 --> 26:13.439
all of these people
are related.

26:13.539 --> 26:14.641
Okay, slow down.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.308
How do you think
they're all connected?

26:16.408 --> 26:19.511
All of these people were treated
by the same psychiatrist, one

26:19.612 --> 26:20.680
Dr. Leon Sarkisian.

26:20.780 --> 26:21.914
He electroshocked

26:22.014 --> 26:23.149
his patients
in front of mirrors.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.051
Kids with mental disorders.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.085
Alan Herskovitz.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.788
He killed Lynn Zobrist.

26:32.524 --> 26:34.827
And then he went after
Lamont Moore.

26:37.463 --> 26:38.631
Lamont Moore--

26:38.731 --> 26:40.633
we know someone
just took him out.

26:40.733 --> 26:43.602
Now, he had a file
on Peter Nesicolacci,

26:43.703 --> 26:45.672
aka Albert Santoni.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.707
Albert was
the Italian-speaking dishwasher

26:47.807 --> 26:49.976
who killed Chef
Dario Donnelly.

26:52.845 --> 26:55.982
So, Lamont was
interested in the case?
No.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.484
He was interested in Albert
before there ever was a case.

26:58.584 --> 27:00.119
Folsom and I found
an old dossier

27:00.219 --> 27:01.620
stuffed in the overflow pipe

27:01.721 --> 27:03.289
of Lamont's
motel bathtub.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.857
Along with...

27:04.957 --> 27:06.826
this note.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.560
"Keep your secrets.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.697
Cull the rotten fruit."

27:10.797 --> 27:11.764
Someone was ordering

27:11.864 --> 27:13.733
Lamont to kill Albert.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.034
But he didn't.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.804
Because Albert
jumped off a building

27:17.904 --> 27:19.338
before we could arrest him.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.173
Hold on.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.608
No!

27:24.410 --> 27:27.213
Lamont never acted on the
instructions he was given.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.916
He just seemed like a troubled
soul when we met him,

27:30.016 --> 27:32.118
but there was
a sweetness in there.

27:32.218 --> 27:33.686
I think

27:33.786 --> 27:36.823
Lamont paid the price
for resisting someone's command.

27:36.923 --> 27:38.624
Okay, so what's the link to

27:38.725 --> 27:40.459
Clarence and Shelby?
Were they

27:40.559 --> 27:43.062
patients of this
quack Sarkisian?
No.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.564
And there's no connection
to anyone else on the board.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.233
I-I mean, I think
there's reason to believe

27:47.333 --> 27:49.435
that these two were innocent
bystanders who just got

27:49.535 --> 27:50.937
caught up in this mess.

27:51.037 --> 27:54.340
Okay. Well, the only person
left alive on this board

27:54.440 --> 27:55.842
is Alan Herskovitz.

27:55.942 --> 27:58.945
We were already planning
on paying him another visit.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.813
Let's talk to him,
find out if the voice

28:00.913 --> 28:03.015
that was telling him to murder
people was just in his head

28:03.115 --> 28:06.218
or someone was whispering
in his ear.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.908
Hello, Alan.

28:30.409 --> 28:31.844
Have we met?

28:33.245 --> 28:35.147
We have, haven't we?

28:36.215 --> 28:37.116
We're the reason

28:37.216 --> 28:38.217
you're here.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.218
Mm.

28:39.318 --> 28:42.021
There's so much that's...

28:42.121 --> 28:44.490
fuzzy. I...

28:44.590 --> 28:46.025
I have trouble remembering.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.994
Yeah, well, we're here to talk
about what you do remember,

28:48.094 --> 28:51.330
starting with him.
Lamont Moore.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.132
You broke into
his house,

28:53.232 --> 28:54.666
tried to kill him.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.869
You remember that,
don't you?

28:56.969 --> 28:58.270
Well, he's dead now.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.773
Someone came and finished
what you started.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.441
We just want to know
who wanted him dead.

29:02.541 --> 29:03.976
You said someone put you up

29:04.076 --> 29:05.311
to it.

29:13.519 --> 29:16.622
Um, I don't want to talk to you.

29:19.025 --> 29:21.460
You don't want
to come off as sane.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.628
I get it.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.865
You'd rather die in a psych ward
than on death row.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.834
We're not here to
take that away.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.501
Have you seen

29:29.601 --> 29:31.938
one of these before?

29:32.038 --> 29:34.206
Hmm?

29:36.175 --> 29:38.544
Where did this
come from?

29:38.644 --> 29:40.512
Where did you get that?

29:40.612 --> 29:42.614
We were hoping
you would tell us.

29:42.714 --> 29:45.151
You said that someone
was speaking to you.

29:45.251 --> 29:46.252
A voice.

29:46.352 --> 29:47.653
Is this what you
were talking about?

29:47.753 --> 29:49.355
You're already too late.

29:49.455 --> 29:50.389
Too late?

29:50.489 --> 29:52.091
Too-too late for what, Alan?

29:52.191 --> 29:53.625
Don't you get it?

29:55.828 --> 29:57.864
This is all by design.

29:57.964 --> 30:00.933
A thing begun
is already half done.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.601
There will be more.

30:02.701 --> 30:05.571
More what?
More blood.

30:05.671 --> 30:07.206
More reckoning.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.841
The wheel will spin

30:08.941 --> 30:12.411
and there's nothing
that you or I or anyone

30:12.511 --> 30:14.380
can do about it.

30:16.748 --> 30:19.218
Alan, Alan, stop.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.520
Alan, just-just stop.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.422
Alan...
Nurse!

30:30.529 --> 30:33.265
Oh, he's either crazy or
stone-cold committed to the act.

30:33.365 --> 30:34.766
Oh, either way,

30:34.867 --> 30:36.702
I-I'm not sure
there's much difference.

30:36.802 --> 30:38.037
He's not gonna
give us anything more.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.771
If we find out
who killed Lamont

30:39.872 --> 30:41.473
and our two bystanders,

30:41.573 --> 30:43.342
maybe we'll figure out the rest.

30:43.442 --> 30:46.045
Ooh, every time I stray
from the physical evidence,

30:46.145 --> 30:48.014
I think I'm gonna end up
in a place like this.

30:48.114 --> 30:49.415
Let's get back to it, then.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.450
'Cause if he's right
and there's more blood coming,

30:51.550 --> 30:53.085
we better work fast.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.677
All right, got the addresses.
Now all we have...

31:18.777 --> 31:19.878
Can I ask you a question?

31:19.979 --> 31:21.680
Uh, yeah, yeah. Shoot.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.082
You've been here
for five months

31:23.182 --> 31:25.251
and somehow you
have no fear.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.752
I wouldn't say no fear.

31:26.852 --> 31:29.688
Bears, snakes, large erratic
insects, skin cancer...

31:29.788 --> 31:31.257
But I mean,
with hypotheses.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.592
You just put it out there
with no hesitation.

31:33.692 --> 31:34.893
How do you do that?

31:34.994 --> 31:36.195
I think I've had the fear
of looking stupid

31:36.295 --> 31:37.296
beaten out of me.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.530
I've been married
a bunch of years,

31:38.630 --> 31:39.631
I've got kids.

31:39.731 --> 31:40.799
I know exactly how stupid I am.

31:40.899 --> 31:44.870
Say instead of you,
you were me.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.141
Well...

31:49.241 --> 31:51.510
first, I would
give myself a break.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.445
Yeah?

31:53.545 --> 31:54.981
And then I would remember,

31:55.081 --> 31:57.283
I mean, you have to make
stupid mistakes,

31:57.383 --> 32:00.352
ask stupid questions.

32:00.452 --> 32:03.222
I mean, the only way
to become less stupid

32:03.322 --> 32:05.091
is to be stupid.

32:06.125 --> 32:09.528
Ooh! Boss, hey, uh,
the poop is talking.

32:09.628 --> 32:10.829
Hope it's saying good things.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.231
FGx analysis gave
us a precise

32:12.331 --> 32:14.300
chemical breakdown of the corn
in the grackle poop

32:14.400 --> 32:15.434
on the murder weapon.

32:15.534 --> 32:16.702
Well, look at that.

32:17.503 --> 32:19.771
And the corn in the grackle
scat has a proprietary

32:19.871 --> 32:22.674
bacteria-derived protein
active against rootworm.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.276
That protein is exclusive to

32:24.376 --> 32:26.612
Fat Cow brand GMO
livestock feed.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.247
And how common is it?

32:28.347 --> 32:30.116
Only a half dozen feed buyers
in the greater Vegas area.

32:30.216 --> 32:32.118
All right, let's split up
and check 'em all.

32:32.218 --> 32:33.552
I want to find this guy fast.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.554
Before he gets any further
down his hit list.

32:36.355 --> 32:39.491
Yeah, okay.
I'll let you know.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.262
Folsom and Beau struck out.

32:43.362 --> 32:46.999
Hope we're not about
to do the same.

32:49.268 --> 32:53.572
I already feel better about
this place than the last one.

32:57.543 --> 33:01.080
I'd call that
a plague of grackles.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.714
It's full of tools.

33:02.814 --> 33:06.152
Maybe this is how the murder
weapon got crapped on.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.587
Farm belongs to a guy
named Richard Ambrose Sloan.

33:08.687 --> 33:11.123
He's definitely got
the name of a serial killer.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.524
I don't think I can
arrest someone

33:12.624 --> 33:14.826
based on vibes, but

33:14.926 --> 33:16.562
this dude would be
a great candidate.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.430
Do you think anyone's home?

33:33.812 --> 33:37.449
Richard Sloan? LVPD.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.520
The door is open.

33:41.620 --> 33:45.124
Mr. Sloan, we're coming in.

33:55.067 --> 33:58.204
LVPD. Anyone home?

34:00.339 --> 34:02.574
Mr. Sloan?

34:05.043 --> 34:06.645
Hello?

34:10.182 --> 34:12.184
Richard?

34:12.284 --> 34:14.253
Hello?

34:17.289 --> 34:19.024
I don't think
anyone's here.

34:21.960 --> 34:22.894
Hold still.
Hey!

34:22.994 --> 34:24.163
Stop!

34:24.263 --> 34:25.964
Get off her. Okay.

34:26.064 --> 34:28.767
Richard.
Richard, listen to me.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.669
You don't want to do this.
I have to.

34:30.769 --> 34:32.104
I don't
want to shoot you.

34:32.204 --> 34:35.040
The plan is in motion.
We must not interfere.

34:35.141 --> 34:37.309
Interfere with what?

34:37.409 --> 34:40.379
The Basilisk.
The Basilisk commands me.

34:40.479 --> 34:42.948
The path must be clear.
The Basilisk knows all.

34:43.048 --> 34:44.416
I don't know about that,
but I know that

34:44.516 --> 34:47.619
you didn't want to kill those
two people at the hotel.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.588
It wasn't part of the plan.

34:49.688 --> 34:52.023
The path must be clear.

34:52.124 --> 34:53.359
Hey, I'm not part of
the plan, either, dude.

34:53.459 --> 34:56.128
No choice. You help or suffer.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.029
I had to find Lamont Moore.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.698
The Basilisk is very clear:

34:59.798 --> 35:01.032
let no one

35:01.133 --> 35:02.000
stand in its way.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.635
But I was blinded.

35:04.836 --> 35:07.072
Aah!

35:18.049 --> 35:20.786
The wrong man.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.521
I had to clean
up the mess.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.022
I had to clear the path.

35:24.122 --> 35:27.025
The Basilisk
commands it of me.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.295
Richard, you're just
making a bigger mess.

35:29.395 --> 35:31.797
Richard. Hey, Richard,
Richard, lis-listen to me.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.000
Chavez!

35:44.810 --> 35:46.512
BP's dropping.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.248
Dispatch says they have
an OR waiting for him

35:49.348 --> 35:50.749
at Desert Palm.
That's if he makes it that far.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.619
This is my
punishment. My...

35:53.719 --> 35:56.222
my failure.
I didn't protect the Basilisk.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.391
W-What do you mean?
Who is the Basilisk?

35:59.491 --> 36:02.394
It found me through time.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.762
It sees everything.
It s...

36:03.862 --> 36:05.831
it saw my failure.

36:05.931 --> 36:08.567
This guy's crazy, too.

36:09.701 --> 36:10.736
Richard...

36:10.836 --> 36:11.970
No, no, no,
Ri-Richard,

36:12.070 --> 36:13.339
wake up!

36:16.107 --> 36:17.943
<i>Richard Sloan's in surgery.</i>

36:18.043 --> 36:21.580
He was still breathing,
but unlikely he'll make it.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.682
You did the best you could.

36:23.782 --> 36:26.151
Did he tell you anything?
Mm. Even while

36:26.252 --> 36:29.788
he was bleeding to death, Sloan
kept talking about the Basilisk.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.757
The Basilisk?
I looked it up.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.559
It's an Internet
thought experiment

36:33.659 --> 36:35.927
about an omniscient
artificial intelligence.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.429
Like Siri?

36:37.529 --> 36:38.730
On meth.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.733
Supposedly, in the future,
the Basilisk

36:41.833 --> 36:43.702
will torment anyone who
doesn't do its bidding.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.438
So, in Sloan's mind,
we're all doomed.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.140
Sloan believed this AI was
talking to him from the future,

36:49.241 --> 36:51.543
telling him
to kill Lamont Moore.

36:51.643 --> 36:54.012
So, why does a sci-fi villain

36:54.112 --> 36:56.248
want to kill a hotel janitor?

37:01.086 --> 37:03.589
<i>True believers in the Basilisk
think the AI</i>

37:03.689 --> 37:06.692
<i>will kill anyone who tries
to stop its rise to power</i>

37:06.792 --> 37:09.595
<i>or anyone who fails to help it.</i>

37:09.695 --> 37:11.530
<i>So, if the Basilisk</i>

37:11.630 --> 37:14.132
<i>told Sloan to kill Lamont,</i>

37:14.232 --> 37:16.468
then I'm sure it made a lot
more sense once he stopped

37:16.568 --> 37:18.837
taking his Haloperidol.

37:18.937 --> 37:20.739
So, meanwhile, back in reality,

37:20.839 --> 37:23.208
Sloan's being
manipulated by somebody.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.311
Just like Alan Herskovitz.
I don't think

37:25.411 --> 37:27.413
it's a computer
or a disembodied voice

37:27.513 --> 37:29.815
or the Easter Bunny
talking to either of them. No.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.450
I mean, odds are
it's the same person

37:31.550 --> 37:32.584
behind all of it.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.953
Whoever it is,

37:35.053 --> 37:37.823
I've got the feeling
they're not done.

37:43.295 --> 37:44.530
You know,

37:44.630 --> 37:47.299
following the corn
was the right instinct.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.968
But you know what
would have happened

37:50.068 --> 37:51.269
if I hadn't dragged
it out of you?

37:51.370 --> 37:53.905
We'd still be staring
down a dead end.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.178
I thought, you know...

38:00.278 --> 38:03.782
Beau's a big-deal chemist
and you're a legend,

38:03.882 --> 38:05.884
so, there's...
neither of you thought of it,

38:05.984 --> 38:08.820
then there's no way
it could be right. Right?

38:08.920 --> 38:10.856
Wrong. Obviously.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.792
It's just...
the corn thing was...

38:13.892 --> 38:15.727
it was worse than a guess.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.696
It was a gut feeling, a hunch.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.699
We don't play hunches,
we test hypotheses.
Yeah, I know.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.669
But I was thinking
that you noticed that

38:23.769 --> 38:25.504
I was thinking something,
so maybe next time

38:25.604 --> 38:28.206
you could just ask me.

38:31.109 --> 38:34.145
You don't get paid to sit around
until someone asks your opinion.

38:35.847 --> 38:38.484
Speak up.

38:38.584 --> 38:40.386
Or hang it up.

38:45.056 --> 38:48.159
Allie. Hey.
Are you doing okay?

38:48.259 --> 38:50.662
Yeah. Still a little jittery
from the adrenaline,

38:50.762 --> 38:52.598
but I'll be all right.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.500
Okay.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.935
So, I got to drive Serena home

38:57.035 --> 39:00.572
after she talks to IAB
about the shooting.

39:00.672 --> 39:01.840
Mm, don't worry.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.241
I mean, I think it'll
go in her favor.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.210
Sloan didn't really give
her much of a choice.

39:05.310 --> 39:06.912
Knowing Serena,
as soon as I get her home

39:07.012 --> 39:08.380
she's gonna tell me to get lost

39:08.480 --> 39:10.649
so she can recoup with
reality TV and shots of mezcal.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.821
You want to run flash cards?

39:17.656 --> 39:20.759
Josh, um...

39:20.859 --> 39:22.794
things are complicated.

39:22.894 --> 39:25.163
What do you mean?

39:25.263 --> 39:27.365
I was just in a life-
or-death situation

39:27.466 --> 39:29.267
with your girlfriend,

39:29.367 --> 39:31.102
and all I should have
been thinking about

39:31.202 --> 39:33.405
was getting us both out okay.
And you did.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.206
I was thinking about you.

39:36.642 --> 39:39.377
And what would you do

39:39.478 --> 39:42.414
or say if things went wrong?

39:43.415 --> 39:44.783
Allie, it's not...

39:44.883 --> 39:46.952
You're the most important
person in my life here.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.389
But you're with Chavez now.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.995
We can't be friends.

39:58.697 --> 40:01.332
Not like we have been.

40:02.468 --> 40:06.772
Tell Serena I'll see you both
on our next shift. Yeah?

40:17.949 --> 40:19.384
So, this is Sloan's laptop.

40:19.485 --> 40:20.919
Yep, and there you have it.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.921
Someone did send Sloan
a dossier

40:23.021 --> 40:24.756
on Lamont.

40:24.856 --> 40:26.458
And blackmail, too,
just like the papers

40:26.558 --> 40:28.426
Allie pulled
out of Lamont's tub.
Mm-hmm.

40:28.527 --> 40:29.995
Uh-oh.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.563
Wait a minute, what happened?
Where'd it go?

40:31.663 --> 40:33.031
Got me.
I didn't touch it.

40:33.131 --> 40:35.100
Well, try clicking
on the thing...

40:35.200 --> 40:36.535
Oh!
Whoa-whoa! Penny,

40:36.635 --> 40:38.203
what's going on?
That file didn't
close by itself.

40:38.303 --> 40:39.805
Someone's accessing
the computer.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.607
Maybe through a RAT.

40:41.707 --> 40:43.041
A rat?

40:43.141 --> 40:44.610
Remote access Trojan.
It's a malware program

40:44.710 --> 40:45.811
that lets a hacker take over.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.212
Like, they could have
closed the file

40:47.312 --> 40:49.748
while we're looking at it?
It's not just the files.

40:49.848 --> 40:52.083
It can control
the whole machine.

40:52.183 --> 40:54.019
Including the webcam.

40:56.187 --> 40:58.490
If someone was
keeping tabs on Sloan...

40:58.590 --> 41:01.827
They could have been
watching him through the camera.
