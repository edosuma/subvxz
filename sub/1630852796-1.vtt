Since I need a 3.0
to stay on the team.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.460
Oh, the team, the team.

15:59.493 --> 16:02.062
Don't act like you
don't care, pinko.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.832
Douche-box's work is
beyond college level,

16:03.865 --> 16:06.300
but now we have to do
it because she can.

16:07.502 --> 16:09.804
Erik's right, this is bullshit.

16:09.838 --> 16:13.073
Shipley, I swear to
God, if I can't play

16:13.106 --> 16:15.275
next Friday because of math,

16:15.309 --> 16:18.045
I will microwave
your TV dinner ass.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.583
Ew!

16:21.616 --> 16:24.251
[ticking music]

16:26.621 --> 16:30.224
I really didn't study
or do the reading.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.292
[ticking music]

16:32.326 --> 16:33.327
I swear.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.196
It's fine, no one
should give a shit,

16:36.230 --> 16:38.398
so can we stop
talking about school,

16:38.432 --> 16:41.803
and put our considerable
free-thinking brains to good use?

16:41.836 --> 16:44.171
Like raiding Rakowski's
whisky stash.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.807
Rakowski's got a whisky stash?

16:45.840 --> 16:47.407
Son, Father will provide.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.845
Thanks, Pops.

16:50.879 --> 16:53.413
So raid on Friday night
before Brody gets here first?

16:53.447 --> 16:54.281
Yeah, I'm down.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.519
Well, what about
the new cameras?

16:58.485 --> 17:00.020
[Student] What new cameras?

17:02.189 --> 17:04.191
[fluttering music]

17:04.223 --> 17:05.092
Those fascists.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.694
It doesn't matter,
we'll get around them.

17:07.729 --> 17:09.329
Friday night it is.

17:09.363 --> 17:10.531
[Merritt] Ellis, do you recall

17:10.565 --> 17:12.499
what Cathy said
about my genitals?

17:12.534 --> 17:14.233
[Ellis] Okay, so sneak out.

17:14.268 --> 17:15.869
The athletic wing will be open.

17:16.771 --> 17:18.070
It's Nadia's home game.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.540
[Nadia] If I play.

17:19.574 --> 17:21.776
Hey, Hoover, why'd you
fuck me at practice

17:21.809 --> 17:23.477
- the other day?
- Where is she going?

17:23.511 --> 17:25.178
[French] Oh, this
is gonna be good.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.714
I can't even.

17:26.748 --> 17:28.883
How are we gonna get
around the security cameras

17:28.917 --> 17:30.450
on every single corner?

17:30.484 --> 17:31.953
Wow, that was violent.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.254
You can hack them.

17:35.690 --> 17:37.157
You can?

17:37.190 --> 17:38.425
Is no one else seeing this?

17:38.458 --> 17:42.129
Well, I only know
the theory, but, yeah.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.397
[Nadia and student grunting]

17:43.430 --> 17:44.566
Damn.

17:44.599 --> 17:46.968
Coach should probably
be seeing this.

17:47.001 --> 17:49.069
Cool, awesome, we'll do it.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.404
[Nadia and student grunting]

17:50.437 --> 17:51.506
She might kill her, guys.

17:51.539 --> 17:54.107
Nadi, for shit's
sake, put her down.

17:54.141 --> 17:54.909
[student whimpering]

17:54.943 --> 17:55.877
Raid!

17:55.910 --> 17:56.678
[student whimpering]

17:56.711 --> 17:57.512
[Merritt] Nadi.

17:57.545 --> 17:58.278
[camera clicks]

17:58.312 --> 17:59.547
Nadi, just get off her.

18:05.620 --> 18:07.956
[Jane sighs]

18:07.989 --> 18:09.724
[bell rings]

18:09.757 --> 18:14.762
[students chatter]
[soft music]

18:16.096 --> 18:17.397
[PA Announcer]
Attention, students,

18:17.431 --> 18:19.199
as a reminder, flight
school and drama club

18:19.232 --> 18:21.703
are canceled this afternoon
for the installation

18:21.736 --> 18:24.505
of polycore security windows.

18:24.539 --> 18:27.508
Also, please, be aware
that the new security gate

18:27.542 --> 18:29.677
will be activated in 20 minutes.

18:30.645 --> 18:33.881
[slow, pulsing music]

18:43.658 --> 18:44.458
Hello?

18:46.628 --> 18:49.229
[clock ticks]

19:14.454 --> 19:16.958
[Jane chuckles]

19:18.526 --> 19:19.527
[Aunspach] Hi.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.630
- Hi.
- Jane, good to see ya.

19:23.898 --> 19:26.534
[door clicks]

19:29.804 --> 19:32.907
So I wanted to ask
you about that retake.

19:34.108 --> 19:36.511
[blinds buzz]

19:39.479 --> 19:42.249
[friends chatter]

19:43.216 --> 19:44.418
[Aunspach sighs]

19:44.451 --> 19:45.820
Look, Mr. Aunspach.

19:45.853 --> 19:48.690
[friends chatter]

19:50.692 --> 19:53.628
Mr. Aunspach, did you hear me?

19:53.661 --> 19:56.396
You ever feel like you're
living in the wrong time?

19:57.532 --> 19:59.667
Like someone mixed up
when you were born?

20:01.536 --> 20:02.870
[Jane] Um-

20:02.904 --> 20:06.206
- I always thought I should
be on the great frontier,

20:07.340 --> 20:09.777
back when the railroads
were being built,

20:09.811 --> 20:13.581
when there were new
towns, cities, sheriffs.

20:15.583 --> 20:20.588
No plastics, no
screens, no wifi.

20:23.223 --> 20:27.995
Like our mascot, Anvil Al,
working with his tools,

20:28.029 --> 20:30.363
forging things of
substance, potential.

20:32.934 --> 20:35.536
I mean, I always thought
he looked kind of silly,

20:37.205 --> 20:40.541
you know, with all
that hair. [chuckles]

20:40.575 --> 20:41.408
Number nine.

20:43.778 --> 20:45.412
You got it wrong on your test.

20:46.614 --> 20:49.584
Oh, yeah, I must've-

20:49.617 --> 20:53.554
- It's odd to me because,
given your understanding

20:53.588 --> 20:56.256
of the concepts, I don't
see why that 96 wasn't 100.

20:58.860 --> 21:02.096
Well, there's been a lot
to study for the semester.

21:03.531 --> 21:04.599
How long did you study?

21:07.568 --> 21:08.736
Hours?

21:08.770 --> 21:10.303
- I'm not sure.
- Not at all?

21:10.337 --> 21:12.339
No, no, I did study, and-

21:12.372 --> 21:13.808
- Don't lie.

21:13.841 --> 21:15.810
I see how you are in my class.

21:15.843 --> 21:18.613
You don't listen,
you don't take notes.

21:19.647 --> 21:21.249
It's because of them, isn't it?

21:21.281 --> 21:22.950
Because of what they'll think.

21:24.152 --> 21:27.755
I thought I told you,
don't feel ashamed.

21:27.789 --> 21:30.958
No, no, I'm not ashamed,

21:30.992 --> 21:34.629
and I do listen, I
do take notes, I do.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.430
Hey, wait.

21:39.834 --> 21:40.635
Can you stop?

21:40.668 --> 21:43.671
[pencils clatter]

21:49.811 --> 21:51.245
[Aunspach sighs]

21:51.279 --> 21:55.249
Okay, so I'm
already doing better

21:55.283 --> 21:56.617
than everybody else here.

21:56.651 --> 21:59.253
Better than who,
a bunch of morons?

21:59.287 --> 22:02.590
There are two kinds
of people, Jane.

22:02.623 --> 22:04.826
Fiddle people, hammer people.

22:04.859 --> 22:07.327
Fiddle people, they can't
build, they can't make.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.462
They play, they drive
their convertibles,

22:09.496 --> 22:13.400
and then, after a while, summer
ends, and what happens then?

22:13.433 --> 22:15.570
They take from
the hammer people,

22:15.603 --> 22:17.238
the people that have been
working month after month,

22:17.271 --> 22:18.673
who don't trash their gifts.

22:18.706 --> 22:20.942
They use them to make things.

22:20.975 --> 22:23.010
Fiddle people, hammer people,

22:23.044 --> 22:26.647
and it's my job to make
you pick up the hammer.

22:27.882 --> 22:29.784
But all I see is you hanging
out with the fiddlers,

22:29.817 --> 22:32.987
trying to get them to like
you, and you know what?

22:33.020 --> 22:34.989
It's not cute, Jane.

22:35.022 --> 22:35.857
It's pathetic.

22:38.292 --> 22:40.493
This, this is a waste.

22:41.394 --> 22:43.865
They are a waste.

22:43.898 --> 22:47.568
That, that is a gift.

22:49.170 --> 22:50.705
Don't you dare throw it away.

22:50.738 --> 22:53.341
[clock ticks]

22:54.842 --> 22:58.212
[droning ambient music]

23:09.824 --> 23:10.591
Okay.

23:15.196 --> 23:18.599
[fast, fluttering music]

23:23.871 --> 23:25.172
Fuck you!

23:25.206 --> 23:30.211
[fast, fluttering music]
[Jane pants]

23:35.383 --> 23:38.719
[fast, fluttering music]

23:46.961 --> 23:49.764
[ticking music]

24:05.613 --> 24:07.581
Hey, Merritt.

24:07.615 --> 24:10.918
[fast, fluttering music]

24:14.722 --> 24:17.258
[crow caws]

24:17.291 --> 24:19.694
[birds tweet]

24:27.134 --> 24:29.670
[bell rings]

24:36.811 --> 24:39.914
[jagged, lush music]

24:55.429 --> 24:57.331
Do you think he'll do something?

24:57.365 --> 24:58.165
Sure.

25:03.671 --> 25:04.972
Okay, but I really don't want

25:05.006 --> 25:06.173
to make it a big deal, Merritt.

25:06.207 --> 25:08.175
Really, really,
'cause I just wanna

25:08.209 --> 25:10.478
tell what happened,
and maybe he'll talk

25:10.511 --> 25:12.546
to him about it and that's
it, and then we can go, so.

25:12.580 --> 25:13.381
Jane.

25:14.215 --> 25:15.316
Chill your clit.

25:19.487 --> 25:20.554
[Secretary] Ladies.

25:30.798 --> 25:31.999
Mr. Lawson.

25:33.401 --> 25:34.802
So, you approached him-

25:35.836 --> 25:40.374
- Oh, no, no, no,
he approached me.

25:41.876 --> 25:45.546
And he grabbed my backpack,
he took out my notebook,

25:45.579 --> 25:47.214
and he get got really angry.

25:47.248 --> 25:49.216
So he was angry
you had a notebook?

25:51.585 --> 25:53.988
No, he was mad that the
notebook had drawings in it.

25:54.021 --> 25:56.891
So your calculus notebook
was full of drawings?

25:58.726 --> 26:00.728
That's not the point.

26:02.063 --> 26:06.434
He got really close to me,
and he got really angry.

26:06.467 --> 26:08.369
Angry you weren't
applying yourself.

26:09.370 --> 26:10.871
Yeah, makes sense to me.

26:10.905 --> 26:13.374
Sir, this isn't the first time

26:13.407 --> 26:16.911
I felt really
uncomfortable around him,

26:18.446 --> 26:19.880
but this time he did more.

26:19.914 --> 26:23.851
He reached out at me and
grabbed me and shook me-

26:23.884 --> 26:26.754
- Do you prefer to
always feel comfortable,

26:26.787 --> 26:29.924
never be told how to
improve, how to get better?

26:31.992 --> 26:33.394
That's not what I'm saying.

26:33.427 --> 26:35.930
That's what a good
teacher does, Miss Shipley.

26:37.064 --> 26:38.232
[Jane] I understand, but this-

26:38.265 --> 26:39.800
- I don't like how
this is being handled.

26:44.105 --> 26:45.272
I'm sorry?

26:45.306 --> 26:46.874
And, more importantly,
I don't think

26:46.907 --> 26:48.476
my father would, either.

26:53.114 --> 26:54.281
Miss Sinclair-

26:54.315 --> 26:57.051
- Mr. Lawson, the
school board's opinion

26:57.084 --> 26:59.453
does matter to you, doesn't it?

26:59.487 --> 27:01.922
How much do your wife's
medical bills run a month?

27:07.161 --> 27:08.629
Let's try this again.

27:08.662 --> 27:11.098
And this time, you'll
let Jane finish,

27:11.132 --> 27:13.134
and, when she does, you'll think

27:13.167 --> 27:15.035
very hard about that opinion

27:15.069 --> 27:18.172
and exactly what you'll do
with your staff to preserve it.

27:24.979 --> 27:28.349
[piercing, droning music]

27:29.783 --> 27:30.585
Go on.

27:31.886 --> 27:36.525
[piercing, droning music]
[clock ticks]

27:37.191 --> 27:38.759
[person knocks]

27:38.792 --> 27:40.161
[Woman] Mr. Aunspach.

27:40.194 --> 27:41.462
[piercing, droning music]

27:41.495 --> 27:43.063
[person knocks]

27:43.097 --> 27:44.198
Mr. Aunspach.

27:44.231 --> 27:49.003

[piercing, droning music]

27:49.036 --> 27:54.041
[droning music]
[people cheering]

27:57.878 --> 28:00.080
[Announcer] Wow, what
a nail-biter, folks.

28:00.114 --> 28:01.448
[Spectators] Let's go, Anvils!

28:01.482 --> 28:03.083
[Announcer] We're all tied up.

28:03.117 --> 28:05.587
With only minutes left in
penalty for either team

28:05.620 --> 28:07.721
to seal the deal.

28:07.755 --> 28:09.356
Today's game has
been brought to you

28:09.390 --> 28:12.993
by Paul's Polycore
Security Glass.

28:13.027 --> 28:15.396
Here comes Paul
himself for a test.

28:15.429 --> 28:18.032
[people cheer]

28:18.065 --> 28:21.035
[hammer thunks]

28:21.068 --> 28:23.037
Look, folks, not even
Anvil Al can break

28:23.070 --> 28:25.372
the patented polycore pane.

28:25.406 --> 28:27.841
Yeah, that's right,
Brody can't even break it!

28:27.875 --> 28:28.776
Boo!

28:28.809 --> 28:30.811
Brody sucks, Brody sucks!

28:30.844 --> 28:33.180
[Announcer] Paul's
Polycore, protecting property,

28:33.214 --> 28:34.616
protecting people.

28:34.649 --> 28:35.983
Go, Nadia, woo!

28:37.184 --> 28:39.987
I hate you, Brody, I hate you!

28:40.020 --> 28:41.590
[Ellis] Hey, look
who's over there.

28:41.623 --> 28:44.425
Hey, Miss Rakowski, you
picked the wrong mascot.

28:44.458 --> 28:46.994
You made the biggest
mistake of your entire life!

28:47.027 --> 28:48.162
Sure told her, didn't I, Dad?

28:48.195 --> 28:49.664
[Ellis] I'm proud of you, son.

28:49.698 --> 28:51.131
[Announcer] And,
now, back to the field.

28:51.165 --> 28:52.066
Let's go!

28:53.367 --> 28:54.969
What if he does something?

28:55.002 --> 28:56.003
He won't.

28:57.037 --> 28:57.838
Why not?

28:58.939 --> 29:01.141
Stop freaking
your shit and think.

29:01.175 --> 29:03.010
Why do you think the
school kept it quiet?

29:03.043 --> 29:05.946
He leaves, no one talks,
neither side gets screwed.

29:07.114 --> 29:08.916
[Announcer] Parker
receives the pass.

29:10.084 --> 29:11.051
Now it's this whole thing.

29:11.085 --> 29:12.253

The Eagles take
it over the Anvils

[Jane weeps]
[dramatic, percussive music]

01:12:22.844 --> 01:12:27.849
[skittering, tense music]
[Jane pants]

01:13:39.754 --> 01:13:43.157
Jane, good to see you.

01:13:46.961 --> 01:13:48.162
Snickerdoodle?

01:13:49.931 --> 01:13:51.966
Miss Taylor baked these.

01:13:54.302 --> 01:13:55.202
They're very good.

01:14:02.743 --> 01:14:03.711
What do you want?

01:14:06.614 --> 01:14:11.619
You know, I thought that
our last talk was enough,

01:14:13.988 --> 01:14:16.891
but you needed something more,
so that's what I gave you.

01:14:18.491 --> 01:14:20.795
I didn't need
anything from you.

01:14:28.936 --> 01:14:31.572
How did you feel when
you pushed Miss Sinclair?

01:14:33.774 --> 01:14:35.977
Do you think you could've
done that before?

01:14:38.946 --> 01:14:40.247
They held you back, Jane.

01:14:42.482 --> 01:14:44.852
They lowered you to their level.

01:14:44.885 --> 01:14:47.989
Anyone could see that,
except for yourself.

01:14:48.022 --> 01:14:51.459
But, tonight, that all changed.

01:14:53.127 --> 01:14:56.496
You outlasted every single
one of those fiddlers,

01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:59.867
and, now, you are free of them.

01:15:01.268 --> 01:15:03.337
You picked up the hammer.

01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:09.176
And you will accomplish every
exceptional piece of work

01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:10.745
that I know you're capable of,

01:15:10.778 --> 01:15:12.847
that I know you were born to do,

01:15:13.848 --> 01:15:18.786
because, my dearest
Jane, you are special.

01:15:27.828 --> 01:15:31.399
Oh, I forgot.

01:15:33.234 --> 01:15:34.235
I hope it's in here.

01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:40.975
Oh, motherfucker.
[drawer bangs]

01:15:42.511 --> 01:15:43.277
Oh.

01:15:47.214 --> 01:15:48.916
You dropped this the other day,

01:15:50.551 --> 01:15:52.920
so I held onto it for you.

01:16:01.262 --> 01:16:06.267
I'll give it back
if you thank me.

01:16:07.001 --> 01:16:09.437
How about it? [chuckles]

01:16:10.938 --> 01:16:13.542
Thank a man for caring
as much as I have,

01:16:14.742 --> 01:16:17.211
for teaching you how
to become a woman.

01:16:21.849 --> 01:16:24.852
[dark, tense music]

01:16:44.905 --> 01:16:46.273
You know what?

01:16:49.143 --> 01:16:50.811
I have learned something.

01:16:50.845 --> 01:16:54.415
[dark, tense music]

01:16:54.448 --> 01:16:55.749
I'm not pathetic!

[exciting, tense music]

01:17:23.512 --> 01:17:25.012
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

[exciting, tense music]

01:17:27.848 --> 01:17:29.150

Yes!

01:18:10.858 --> 01:18:14.228
[exciting, pulsing music]

01:18:33.047 --> 01:18:35.349

01:18:37.251 --> 01:18:38.052
[phone crunches]

01:18:38.085 --> 01:18:39.654
No!

01:18:39.688 --> 01:18:41.590
You just won't
learn, will you?

01:18:41.623 --> 01:18:43.692
[screeching, dark music]

01:18:43.724 --> 01:18:45.326
