00:08.965 --> 00:10.793
- I think I hate when
a bitch tries me.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.827
-Previously
on "All The Queen's Men"...

00:12.827 --> 00:15.862
- Damn, I called my aunt,
and I'm gonna go work there.

00:15.862 --> 00:18.827
-What is going on with
you and Ms. Patty, Babyface?

00:18.827 --> 00:21.310
- She pays for my
car, my apartment,

00:21.310 --> 00:24.000
shit, extra cash when I need it.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.103
-I think
you would notice.

00:26.103 --> 00:28.103
- Notice what?

00:28.103 --> 00:29.827
- They was getting
all the money.

00:29.827 --> 00:31.517
- Daddy?

00:33.655 --> 00:36.068
- Have you ever been swimming?

00:50.241 --> 00:52.310
-What, your feet hurt?
- No.

00:52.310 --> 00:54.758
- Then why you sitting down?
- I'm fucking tired.

00:56.206 --> 01:00.344
-Found 'em?
- Yes.

01:00.344 --> 01:04.344
- We gotta get that
money out the club.

01:04.344 --> 01:07.068
- I got it, Blue, okay?

01:07.068 --> 01:11.965
- Madam, you sittin'
on that kind of cash.

01:11.965 --> 01:15.965
- Look, the only people that
even know the money is there

01:15.965 --> 01:19.517
are you and I.

01:19.517 --> 01:21.620
- We gotta get it out of there.

01:21.620 --> 01:22.793
- Fine.

01:22.793 --> 01:24.448
-Look...

01:24.448 --> 01:27.275
I know you don't
tell me everything,

01:27.275 --> 01:32.310
and you have a reason for
everything that you do,

01:32.310 --> 01:36.241
but, Madam, this shit
right here is crazy.

01:36.241 --> 01:38.034
- Let me explain
something to you.

01:38.034 --> 01:41.482
Cash is king, okay?

01:41.482 --> 01:43.620
You never know when you
need to make a move,

01:43.620 --> 01:48.482
so for now, it's good.

01:48.482 --> 01:49.931
- Okay.

01:49.931 --> 01:52.241
I just keep trying to tell you.

01:52.241 --> 01:54.689
- Well, I keep trying to tell
you stay strapped,

01:54.689 --> 01:56.793
be by my side,

01:56.793 --> 01:58.517
and I'm good.

01:58.517 --> 02:01.137
- Yes, ma'am, you are the queen.

02:01.137 --> 02:04.689
- You better know it.
Watch they ass.

02:08.448 --> 02:10.517
- Nigga, you missed a spot.

02:53.551 --> 02:54.551
- Hey.

02:54.551 --> 02:56.034
- More cash.

02:56.034 --> 02:58.517
- Hey, put it right
there, thank you.

02:58.517 --> 02:59.896
You good?

02:59.896 --> 03:03.517
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Go home and get some rest.

03:03.517 --> 03:07.586
- Okay.

03:07.586 --> 03:10.482
Doc, come here.
You're okay, all right?

03:10.482 --> 03:13.172
It's gonna be okay.
Come here, bring it down.

03:13.172 --> 03:14.275
It's okay.
-Thank you.

03:14.275 --> 03:16.965
-Mm-hmm. Calm down.

03:21.965 --> 03:24.896
What the fuck are you doing?

03:24.896 --> 03:28.931
- I just wanted to show
you my appreciation.

03:28.931 --> 03:31.689
- Let me the fuck go.

03:37.068 --> 03:41.758
You see this shit?
This is how you thank me, okay?

03:41.758 --> 03:44.000
My daddy taught me don't
you ever put your dick

03:44.000 --> 03:46.034
in the cash register.

03:46.034 --> 03:47.241
- What?

03:47.241 --> 03:49.689
- Look, I was brought up rough,

03:49.689 --> 03:51.413
but you need to take
that advice.

03:51.413 --> 03:52.862
I'm not one of these
thirsty-ass bitches!

03:52.862 --> 03:54.655
Don't you ever put your
fucking dick on my leg

03:54.655 --> 03:57.689
or your face on mine!
You hear me?

03:57.689 --> 03:59.413
- I'm sorry.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.172
- Don't let that shit
happen again, Doc!

04:01.172 --> 04:04.103
- It won't.
- I know it won't.

04:04.103 --> 04:06.310
We good, but get the fuck out!

04:06.310 --> 04:07.931
-I'm sorry.

04:09.689 --> 04:13.137
- Fuck, this motherfucker
just tried to kiss me?

04:13.137 --> 04:16.000
- What'd you say?
- Nothing. What's up?

04:17.655 --> 04:20.862
- Kat just called.
- Okay.

04:20.862 --> 04:24.965
- She's at your sister's house.
Your father's missing.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.689
- What?
- Yeah.

04:29.620 --> 04:32.103
- Get my fucking keys.
Get my shit.

04:46.137 --> 04:47.310
- Man.

04:55.103 --> 04:58.275
- Hi.
-Who the fuck?

04:58.275 --> 05:00.551
Oh, shit.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.620
You here late.
- Well, I wanted to see you, so.

05:08.620 --> 05:10.758
- Look, Pat...
- What?

05:10.758 --> 05:12.862
- I appreciate you
paying for this place,

05:12.862 --> 05:16.068
but you can't keep
popping up over here.

05:16.068 --> 05:19.482
- Oh, I don't know what the
hell you talking about,

05:19.482 --> 05:21.310
'cause if I'm paying for
this place and I have a key,

05:21.310 --> 05:24.379
I'm coming over.

05:24.379 --> 05:26.206
- I was thinking,
you know, just--

05:26.206 --> 05:28.758
- What?

05:28.758 --> 05:31.310
- Nothing.

05:31.310 --> 05:33.241
- Make it up to me.

05:33.241 --> 05:36.241
- Pat, I just worked all night.

05:36.241 --> 05:38.620
The sun is about
to come up soon.

05:38.620 --> 05:41.000
- And I know that, and I have
to go to court in the morning.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.724
I just need, you know, a little
tune-up before I go in.

05:43.724 --> 05:47.620
- No. You do this shit
on purpose.

05:47.620 --> 05:50.103
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

05:50.103 --> 05:52.275
- You just want to make sure
ain't nobody over here with me.

05:52.275 --> 05:53.724
Ain't nobody in this bitch!

05:53.724 --> 05:55.482
- Well, you know
better than to do that.

05:55.482 --> 05:57.206
- I keep telling you that,

05:57.206 --> 06:00.275
so you don't have to keep coming
over here checking up on me.

06:00.275 --> 06:02.000
- I am not checking on you.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.758
I'm just making sure you
good so that, uh, I'm good.

06:06.758 --> 06:08.241
-Yeah, I
know what you mean.

06:08.241 --> 06:10.517
- MS.Mm.

06:10.517 --> 06:12.034
Come on, daddy,

06:12.034 --> 06:15.241
you know that dildo
ain't doing nothing.

06:15.241 --> 06:18.827
- Look, I'm tired.

06:18.827 --> 06:21.034
- Okay.

06:21.034 --> 06:23.965
I'll leave.

06:23.965 --> 06:26.034
- Get yo' ass over here.

06:27.103 --> 06:28.724
- Yes!

06:28.724 --> 06:30.172
Oh!

06:30.172 --> 06:32.137
Mm!

06:33.172 --> 06:34.896
Take it off.

06:36.172 --> 06:39.827
Now that is what mommy
came here over early for.

06:39.827 --> 06:43.379
-- It's late for me.
- MS.- Get in here.

06:44.655 --> 06:45.620
Yes!

06:45.620 --> 06:47.793
You know what I want!

06:47.793 --> 06:50.482
Ooh!

06:50.482 --> 06:53.000
I will get you
whatever you want!

07:06.827 --> 07:08.931
- Have you lost
your fucking mind?

07:08.931 --> 07:12.310
- Keep this bitch away from me!
- Where the fuck is my father?

07:12.310 --> 07:14.275
- She doesn't know.
- What?

07:14.275 --> 07:17.551
-She says she came home
and the door was wide open.

07:17.551 --> 07:20.000
She doesn't know where he is.

07:22.793 --> 07:25.827
- Okay. Let me talk to her.

07:25.827 --> 07:28.068
Got me just, Blue,
I don't give a fuck!

07:28.068 --> 07:30.862
Bring my sister in the fucking
house and close the door.

07:30.862 --> 07:33.793
- Now, look, Kat is my
girl, and she's on our side.

07:33.793 --> 07:36.241
Now you see them
officers over there?

07:36.241 --> 07:38.310
-I told you, she does.
She knows something.

07:38.310 --> 07:42.000
- Ma'am.
- You see those two white men?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.689
We don't know them.

07:44.689 --> 07:47.896
So I ain't gonna
let you do that.

07:47.896 --> 07:50.620
- 'Cause you know I'll blow that
bitch's fucking brains out.

07:50.620 --> 07:54.620
- Yeah, that's why I
ain't gon' let you do it.

07:54.620 --> 07:57.413
- Okay, okay.

07:57.413 --> 07:58.655
I'm calm.

07:58.655 --> 08:00.862
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

08:00.862 --> 08:02.896
- Okay.
- Let me talk to her.

08:02.896 --> 08:04.620
-I don't wanna talk.
- Carla?

08:04.620 --> 08:06.517
- I don't have
anything to say to her.

08:06.517 --> 08:09.241
- Then good, bitch.
Fucking listen.

08:09.241 --> 08:11.517
-- I'm not gon' listen.
-- Listen, okay?

08:11.517 --> 08:13.068
- I don't listen to her.

08:13.068 --> 08:16.689
-Carla, I told you,
he needs full-time care!

08:16.689 --> 08:18.482
I told you that!

08:18.482 --> 08:22.000
But, no, you wanna get him in
this fucking house for a check?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.482
How much is the fucking
check, for real?

08:24.482 --> 08:25.724
Huh?

08:25.724 --> 08:27.000
Oh, you don't have the answer?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.655
Okay.

08:28.655 --> 08:34.344
Carla, if my father
is not returned here

08:34.344 --> 08:40.137
alive and well within one hour,

08:40.137 --> 08:42.724
I don't give a fuck
what officer's here,

08:42.724 --> 08:48.275
you, you, Kat, NATO,

08:48.275 --> 08:51.896
the fucking National Guard,
I don't give a fuck.

08:51.896 --> 08:55.482
I will be back, and I'll
motherfucking kill you,

08:55.482 --> 08:57.620
and you know it.

08:58.862 --> 09:02.275
Carla? Bitch, look at me!

09:02.275 --> 09:06.896
Look at me! One hour. Got it?

09:06.896 --> 09:10.517
Y'all can write that shit down,
'cause, yes, it was a threat.

09:10.517 --> 09:13.379
Got it? Let's go, Blue.

09:13.379 --> 09:17.344
- Your phone's ringing, Madam.

09:19.655 --> 09:21.103
- What?

09:21.103 --> 09:22.896
-Is
this Marylyn Deville?

09:22.896 --> 09:24.724
- Madam. Who is this?

09:24.724 --> 09:26.689
-Let's
pretend it's Allen.

09:26.689 --> 09:28.724
- This don't sound like Allen.

09:28.724 --> 09:33.241
-This
is how the dead sound.

09:33.241 --> 09:35.793
- Who the fuck is this
and where is my father?

09:35.793 --> 09:38.068
-How about
you tell me where Allen is

09:38.068 --> 09:40.724
and I'll tell you
where your father is?

09:40.724 --> 09:42.586
- Look, stop
bullshitting me, okay?

09:42.586 --> 09:44.068
Who the fuck is this?

09:44.068 --> 09:46.724
I told you who I am.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.931
- Let me tell you
something, when I find you,

09:51.931 --> 09:55.034
you better know exactly what the
fuck you're doing right now.

09:55.034 --> 09:57.551
-I know
exactly what I'm doing.

09:57.551 --> 09:58.758
- Do you know who I am?

09:58.758 --> 10:01.655
-I do, Madam.

10:01.655 --> 10:03.862
- Where the fuck is my father?

10:03.862 --> 10:07.344
-The same
place you buried Allen.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.379
- Who was that?

10:11.379 --> 10:13.137
-I told you, she
does, she knows something.

10:13.137 --> 10:17.068
-Ma'am. Ma'am?

10:32.724 --> 10:36.586
-What the fuck, daddy?
Daddy, are you okay?

10:36.586 --> 10:38.620
Blue, somebody is
fucking with me, okay?

10:38.620 --> 10:41.517
I'm not having this shit.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.448
- So what we gonna do?

10:43.448 --> 10:46.758
- We have to get my
father into a home! We have to!

10:46.758 --> 10:48.448
-I knew it!

10:48.448 --> 10:50.517
I knew it, I knew yo' ass had
something to do with this!

10:50.517 --> 10:52.068
You got some--
-Ma'am--

10:52.068 --> 10:53.827
- You got our daddy sitting
in this stanking-ass club!

10:53.827 --> 10:55.793
It's a new low. Come on, daddy.

10:55.793 --> 10:57.965
- No, he ain't going
nowhere with you, bitch! Bitch!

10:57.965 --> 11:00.034
-Listen.
- Fuck he ain't!

11:00.034 --> 11:03.655
-Ma'am. You see
those officers over there?

11:03.655 --> 11:05.724
Look at me.
We don't need no heat.

11:05.724 --> 11:07.206
-I told you!

11:07.206 --> 11:11.103
I told you she had
something to do with this!

11:11.103 --> 11:14.965
Come on, daddy, let's go home.
- He--

11:20.862 --> 11:23.103
-Madam? Madam!

11:46.137 --> 11:47.620
-Hey.

11:47.620 --> 11:49.344
Oh, sorry.

11:49.344 --> 11:52.413
Look, if you're talking about
last night, forget about it.

11:52.413 --> 11:56.689
- Oh, no, I was talking
about this PDA I'm doing.

11:58.724 --> 12:00.206
- It's fine.

12:00.206 --> 12:02.965
- She's just getting
ready to go to work.

12:02.965 --> 12:05.448
- You feeling better?

12:05.448 --> 12:08.379
- I will, soon.

12:08.379 --> 12:09.724
It's good to see you, Kat.

12:09.724 --> 12:11.000
-It's good to see you too.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.896
-Avocado toast
is on your desk.

12:12.896 --> 12:14.551
-Thank you.

12:14.551 --> 12:16.241
You sure know how
to treat a woman.

12:16.241 --> 12:18.448
- Yeah, and that's why
mine loves me, right?

12:18.448 --> 12:20.344
- Mm-hmm.
- I see!

12:22.827 --> 12:24.344
-Hey, Madam.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.896
- Girl, look, I am not
in the mood today, okay?

12:26.896 --> 12:29.379
- Come on.
You gonna let me dance here?

12:29.379 --> 12:31.137
I'm telling you...

12:31.137 --> 12:34.103
- Trouble, I do not need
any new dancers, okay?

12:34.103 --> 12:35.379
- Come on!

12:35.379 --> 12:36.655
I can get your game up!

12:36.655 --> 12:38.379
- Excuse me?

12:38.379 --> 12:39.517
This is Madam.

12:39.517 --> 12:41.586
Her game is already up.

12:41.586 --> 12:42.931
- You better tell 'em.

12:42.931 --> 12:44.931
- Well, listen,
you have something

12:44.931 --> 12:48.758
more like this up in the
club, I'd come check it out.

12:48.758 --> 12:51.448
- I think you better
take yo' ass to work.

12:51.448 --> 12:52.482
- Oh?

12:53.896 --> 12:55.586
- Oh, she's speaking
that Spanish to me.

12:55.586 --> 12:57.793
I don't understand.

12:57.793 --> 12:59.517
- Love you.
- Mm, love you too.

12:59.517 --> 13:01.655
- See you at home? Bye, Madam.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.206
- Bye, Kat.

13:06.517 --> 13:09.172
- What you say?

13:09.172 --> 13:12.068
- I say I will think about it.

13:12.068 --> 13:15.586
- Mm, that's a start.
I'll turn that shit out.

13:15.586 --> 13:18.137
- I bet you will.
Have a good one.

13:25.517 --> 13:26.827
- Yeah.

13:30.068 --> 13:31.379
- Hey.

13:31.379 --> 13:33.482
You still trying to get
in on this amateur night?

13:33.482 --> 13:36.620
- Nah, she ain't having it.

13:36.620 --> 13:38.620
- Let me ask you something.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.793
What do you want?

13:40.793 --> 13:42.379
- I want it all.

13:42.379 --> 13:45.862
- Okay, well, then, I think
you need to bum rush her.

13:45.862 --> 13:47.793
We gon' throw a
surprise on Madam.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.172
-Okay, I got you.

13:49.172 --> 13:50.793
-Yeah, so get
ready, get your shit,

13:50.793 --> 13:52.482
and get ready to perform
at amateur night.

13:52.482 --> 13:54.000
Bring your fucking A-game.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.586
- Oh, I got you, no doubt.
- Okay.

14:17.137 --> 14:19.413
-Your nephew?
- Yeah.

14:19.413 --> 14:21.482
-Thought so.

14:22.655 --> 14:24.310
- Hey.

14:24.310 --> 14:26.034
- Hi.

14:27.275 --> 14:28.586
Who's that?
-Um--

14:28.586 --> 14:30.689
- I'm ready to--
- Hey.

14:30.689 --> 14:32.758
This Red.

14:32.758 --> 14:35.206
He just brought me over.

14:35.206 --> 14:36.655
- Okay.

14:36.655 --> 14:38.551
- You got a really nice club.

14:38.551 --> 14:42.103
I'll do anything to work here.

14:42.103 --> 14:44.724
- Thank you, but I am
not hiring right now.

14:44.724 --> 14:45.689
- You sure, 'cause I got--

14:45.689 --> 14:47.137
- No.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.620
She says she's not
hiring right now, okay?

14:49.620 --> 14:54.482
- But I can.
- Thank you for the ride, yeah?

14:54.482 --> 14:55.413
- All right.

14:55.413 --> 14:56.448
- You can go.

14:56.448 --> 14:58.724
- Sorry.

14:58.724 --> 15:00.068
- You can go.
- See you, Madam.

15:00.068 --> 15:03.413
If you ever need
anything, I'm a ride-or-die.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.862
- I'm sorry, Madam.

15:09.862 --> 15:11.689
- It's okay.

15:13.862 --> 15:16.172
- Hey.

15:16.172 --> 15:18.793
Hey, are you okay?

15:18.793 --> 15:20.931
- Yeah, I'm good.

15:20.931 --> 15:23.793
I had a long-ass night
dealing with my dad.

15:23.793 --> 15:25.310
- Hey, hey, I'm sorry.

15:25.310 --> 15:28.689
Is there anything I could do?

15:28.689 --> 15:30.931
- No, I'm good, I got it.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.965
- Sure?
- Mm-hmm.

15:34.034 --> 15:37.000
- Dime, come see me.

15:44.241 --> 15:47.517
- Hi.
- Hey, come here.

15:47.517 --> 15:50.103
Do me a favor.

15:50.103 --> 15:53.241
Show my nephew what's expected
of him to work the door.

15:53.241 --> 15:54.758
- Yes.

15:54.758 --> 15:56.000
Sure.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.965
-Thank you.

16:00.517 --> 16:02.103
- Yeah.

16:02.103 --> 16:04.413
-Come on.
- Thank you.

16:11.965 --> 16:14.241
-Okay, come on.

16:16.724 --> 16:19.103
Look, it's simple.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.000
All you gotta do is
watch who's coming in.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.758
- Right.

16:22.758 --> 16:25.000
-Make sure that they go
through the metal detectors.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.517
Mm-hmm.

16:26.517 --> 16:28.482
Be sure that they pay,
and click this counter

16:28.482 --> 16:31.448
with every entry so
that the money lines up.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.862
Or--
- Or what?

16:33.862 --> 16:35.965
- You'll get someone killed.

16:35.965 --> 16:37.689
- Oh. Sorry again.

16:37.689 --> 16:40.586
-So every time someone
comes in, press this counter.

16:40.586 --> 16:41.931
Madam loses her shit

16:41.931 --> 16:45.310
if this counter's
even off by one.

16:45.310 --> 16:49.413
So you need to be paying
attention at all times.

16:49.413 --> 16:51.000
- I got you.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.379
- Okay, good.
- Yes.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.517
- Come on, let me
get you a T-shirt.

16:55.517 --> 16:57.068
- Okay.

16:57.068 --> 16:59.896
- Tonight is amateur night,

16:59.896 --> 17:03.517
and it's gonna be wild.

17:15.448 --> 17:17.068
-Someone's here
to see you, Madam.

17:17.068 --> 17:18.931
- Who?

17:18.931 --> 17:22.103
- Not gonna invite me in?

17:22.103 --> 17:24.000
- What do you want, Gene?

17:24.000 --> 17:27.206
-I need to speak to
your business partner, Allen.

17:27.206 --> 17:29.000
We're finalizing some business,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.620
and I can't seem to
get him on the phone.

17:31.620 --> 17:33.068
- And?

17:33.068 --> 17:35.931
-And he seemed
rather excited about

17:35.931 --> 17:38.034
what we're collaborating on.

17:38.034 --> 17:40.206
- Well, Gene, that's
between you two,

17:40.206 --> 17:42.931
and Allen is not here.

17:42.931 --> 17:45.413
I don't know his whereabouts.
I'm not his secretary.

17:45.413 --> 17:48.793
So if that's it,
then you can go on,

17:48.793 --> 17:50.862
'cause I got work to do.

17:50.862 --> 17:53.241
- I'm not sure where all this
hostility is coming from.

17:54.620 --> 17:56.689
May I remind you?

17:56.689 --> 17:59.137
I single-handedly
brought your first club

17:59.137 --> 18:00.517
back from bankruptcy.

18:00.517 --> 18:01.931
Made it to where
you were damn near

18:01.931 --> 18:03.862
printing money over there.

18:03.862 --> 18:06.172
My thank you, what you said,

18:06.172 --> 18:08.103
what came out of yo'
fat little mouth,

18:08.103 --> 18:11.000
was that I would
run the second club.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.862
And what happened
when Drip opened, huh?

18:14.862 --> 18:16.448
Hmm?

18:16.448 --> 18:19.172
Oh, that's right, nothing,
not a got-damn thing.

18:19.172 --> 18:21.896
So that is where
all this hostility

18:21.896 --> 18:23.827
is coming from, Gene.

18:23.827 --> 18:25.275
- That's all just
water under the bridge.

18:25.275 --> 18:27.758
We can do new business.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.965
I'll pass.

18:31.965 --> 18:33.931
- Well, did Allen at least
get the chance to at least

18:33.931 --> 18:36.379
tell you about our deal?

18:36.379 --> 18:38.758
- Oh, yeah, you know
what, he did say that

18:38.758 --> 18:42.068
there was some fat little
impotent man trying to

18:42.068 --> 18:43.931
buy my club out from under me.

18:43.931 --> 18:46.862
I told him
that would not happen,

18:46.862 --> 18:48.275
and we came to an understanding.

18:48.275 --> 18:49.724
-That's not the
impression that I got.

18:49.724 --> 18:53.137
- Not my problem. Now it's time
for you to leave.

19:00.413 --> 19:06.413
When I do buy this place,
I'ma keep this as my office,

19:06.413 --> 19:10.965
but I think I'll probably
put my desk over there.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.793
- Last time.

19:31.620 --> 19:33.827
- You cool?
-Mm-hmm.

19:35.689 --> 19:39.827
I just need to
recharge for a second.

19:39.827 --> 19:42.034
- What you got in mind?

19:42.034 --> 19:44.413
- Hm?

20:14.103 --> 20:16.655
-Damn.

20:16.655 --> 20:18.344
- What?

20:18.344 --> 20:20.551
- They roll in there like that?

20:20.551 --> 20:22.310
- What you talking about?

20:22.310 --> 20:23.896
- Them dancers.

20:23.896 --> 20:25.931
- Oh, yeah.

20:25.931 --> 20:28.068
Top guys got all the top cars.

20:28.068 --> 20:31.000
- Hm, I see.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.758
- Mm-hmm.

20:35.482 --> 20:37.724
Uh, that's amateur night.

20:37.724 --> 20:39.620
You might want to
get back to the door.

20:39.620 --> 20:40.758
- Yeah, my bad.

20:40.758 --> 20:42.172
- Okay, yeah.

20:42.172 --> 20:43.965
Uh, the amateur crowd
is smaller because

20:43.965 --> 20:45.655
it's the earlier
part of the night.

20:45.655 --> 20:50.482
The main crowd?
They come out for the big boys.

20:50.482 --> 20:51.965
- I see.

20:55.172 --> 20:56.931
Sorry.

21:10.034 --> 21:12.689
- Hey.
- Oh, shit!

21:12.689 --> 21:15.137
- Get up out my spot, come on.
- Is it time to start?

21:15.137 --> 21:16.724
- Not yet, bro.

21:16.724 --> 21:19.034
- There's the amateur
night bullshit tonight.

21:19.034 --> 21:20.000
- Oh, that's tonight?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.758
- Yeah.

21:21.758 --> 21:23.896
- Hey bro, how
long you been here?

21:23.896 --> 21:25.620
-I was just
gonna come here and study.

21:25.620 --> 21:27.275
- You do know going to school

21:27.275 --> 21:28.965
for all this college
computer technical shit

21:28.965 --> 21:31.965
is not gonna make you this kind
of money out the gate, right?

21:31.965 --> 21:35.517
- Yeah, I hear you,
but you looking at now.

21:35.517 --> 21:39.482
Shit, you not
getting no younger.

21:39.482 --> 21:41.310
- Yeah, you right.

21:41.310 --> 21:44.103
-Yeah,
I know I'm right.

21:44.103 --> 21:47.482
This shit takes a toll on you,
so don't give me no shit.

21:47.482 --> 21:50.172
-Hey man,
just talking shit.

21:50.172 --> 21:52.000
Proud of you, bro.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.172
I don't know what I'm gonna do
with all these aches and pains.

21:54.172 --> 21:55.517
-Yeah,
tell me about it.

21:55.517 --> 21:58.413
I'm having problems
with my shit.

21:58.413 --> 22:01.965
-Oh, I feel so
sorry for the dancers

22:01.965 --> 22:03.862
that make all the money.

22:03.862 --> 22:06.172
- Madam, we ain't complaining.
-Oh, no?

22:06.172 --> 22:08.068
That's what it
sounds like to me.

22:08.068 --> 22:09.655
- But we not.

22:09.655 --> 22:13.206
- They just talking shit.

22:13.206 --> 22:15.000
- Face, you got a second?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.379
- Sure.

22:18.344 --> 22:20.310
- So is your judge
coming tonight?

22:21.344 --> 22:24.172
I hope not.

22:24.172 --> 22:25.793
- Why not?

22:25.793 --> 22:27.896
-Well, you know
Ms. Patty will be here.

22:27.896 --> 22:32.034
-Unh-unh.
Look, I need her to come, okay?

22:32.034 --> 22:33.758
- Sure?

22:33.758 --> 22:36.034
- Yes.

22:36.034 --> 22:38.241
- Okay, I'll call her.

22:38.241 --> 22:41.068
- Thank you. You do that.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.689
- Got you.

22:42.689 --> 22:44.448
-All right,
fellas, let's get ready!

22:44.448 --> 22:45.793
Let's get this money,

22:45.793 --> 22:48.275
soon as the amateurs
get off the stage.

22:48.275 --> 22:49.862
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

22:57.172 --> 23:00.206
-Gentlemen,
let me be clear.

23:00.206 --> 23:03.862
You all are auditioning
to work here.

23:03.862 --> 23:07.310
If you get the
opportunity to work here,

23:07.310 --> 23:09.482
Madam does not play.

23:09.482 --> 23:12.000
You cannot be late,
you cannot be high,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.482
and you cannot bring any
drugs or any other bullshit

23:14.482 --> 23:16.241
in this club.

23:16.241 --> 23:17.379
We clear?

23:17.379 --> 23:18.620
-Yes.

23:18.620 --> 23:20.620
-Okay, and
whatever you do,

23:20.620 --> 23:21.931
do not go into
that dressing room.

23:21.931 --> 23:25.827
That dressing room is
for our VIP dancers.

23:25.827 --> 23:28.482
You go in there, you
will get your ass beat,

23:28.482 --> 23:31.206
I assure you.

23:31.206 --> 23:34.827
Okay, let me see what you got.

23:34.827 --> 23:36.793
- I'm sorry.

23:36.793 --> 23:38.172
- Yes?

23:38.172 --> 23:40.206
- We gotta audition twice?
- One is for the house,

23:40.206 --> 23:44.482
and the other is
for our lionesses.

23:44.482 --> 23:46.103
- The lionesses?

23:46.103 --> 23:48.206
- That's what we call our
ladies when they get drunk.

23:48.206 --> 23:52.482
And they will eat
your ass alive.

23:52.482 --> 23:55.000
All right, strip.

24:07.689 --> 24:10.620
-Uh, what do you think?

24:10.620 --> 24:13.103
- I don't know.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.344
They have interesting looks.

24:15.344 --> 24:17.206
- Yeah, I know.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.241
-Oh shit, is that
the "white chick" dude?

24:19.241 --> 24:20.241
- Right?

24:21.655 --> 24:23.931
- What are they working with?

24:23.931 --> 24:25.379
- Right.

24:25.379 --> 24:28.517
- All right, cut the music off.

24:28.517 --> 24:31.000
Let me see your dicks.

24:33.413 --> 24:35.551
Are you guys shy?

24:35.551 --> 24:37.793
If so, you don't even
need to audition.

24:37.793 --> 24:41.103
That's how mama makes her money.
Let me see your dick!

24:47.103 --> 24:49.310
Dime?
- Yes, Madam?

24:49.310 --> 24:51.724
- Do you have a
magnifying glass?

24:51.724 --> 24:54.551
-No, ma'am, I don't.

24:54.551 --> 24:58.137
-No, why is that?

24:58.137 --> 25:02.586
- 'Cause if we need to use
one, they can't work here.

25:04.896 --> 25:07.068
- That might work.
- Mm-hmm.

25:07.068 --> 25:10.103
- If you're desperate.

25:10.965 --> 25:13.137
That's nice, but
that hair down there?

25:13.137 --> 25:14.482
That's not cute.

25:14.482 --> 25:16.379
Are you trying to
dread down there too?

25:16.379 --> 25:17.793
-No.

25:17.793 --> 25:19.448
- All right, well,
cut that shit off.

25:19.448 --> 25:22.827
What the fuck is that smell?

25:22.827 --> 25:25.000
- Ass.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.448
- Is that you?

25:28.448 --> 25:30.793
Look, you gotta go, bro.

25:30.793 --> 25:33.103
Well, wait, 'cause that is nice.

25:33.103 --> 25:36.000
Look, we need to teach
him how to bathe.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.103
- Yeah, abso-fricking-lutely.
I'll get on it right now.

25:39.103 --> 25:40.862
- Thank you.

25:40.862 --> 25:44.586
Don't you ever come in here
smelling like that again, okay?

25:44.586 --> 25:47.448
Well, now...

25:47.448 --> 25:50.034
"White girlfriend"
might work out.

25:50.034 --> 25:51.172
- I think so.

25:51.172 --> 25:54.068
- Mm-hmm. All right, fellas,

25:54.068 --> 25:58.896
well, you look like you can
be a part of my amateur night.

25:58.896 --> 26:03.344
If you do well, my
ladies love you,

26:03.344 --> 26:04.517
you have a job.

26:21.551 --> 26:24.517
-All right,

26:24.517 --> 26:26.862

I'ma call you Lotta-Body,

26:30.482 --> 26:34.482

26:50.344 --> 26:51.758
-Y'all see him, mm-hmm.

26:51.758 --> 26:53.379
Go ahead, Big Daddy Whataburger.

26:53.379 --> 26:55.413
I see you!

26:55.413 --> 26:58.724

26:58.724 --> 27:00.241
Keep moving on.

27:04.103 --> 27:05.827
- Come on now!

27:05.827 --> 27:08.931
Y'all throw him some cash!

27:10.965 --> 27:14.206
Let that skinny-ass man,
buy himself a sandwich, okay?

27:16.827 --> 27:18.310
-Go on, give it up.

27:25.758 --> 27:28.551
- We almost done
with the amateurs?

27:28.551 --> 27:30.137
- We got one more left.

27:30.137 --> 27:31.827
- Okay.

27:31.827 --> 27:35.172
Let him go and shut it down.

27:35.172 --> 27:38.689
- It's a her.

27:38.689 --> 27:40.551
-What?

27:40.551 --> 27:43.793
- I think you're gonna
want to see this.

27:44.517 --> 27:46.068
Let's give it up, ladies!

27:46.068 --> 27:50.379
Makes some motherfucking
noise for Trouble.

29:11.137 --> 29:15.689
- That is exactly what we need
to shake things up around here.

29:15.689 --> 29:19.758
A whole different kind of sexy.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.103
- Told ya.

29:25.448 --> 29:26.620
Do yourselves a favor, then.

29:26.620 --> 29:29.241
Re-up on your ones
and your drinks,

29:29.241 --> 29:33.206
get your merch and be back
in your seats by then.

29:33.206 --> 29:37.551
You don't wanna miss a
second of this shit.

29:37.551 --> 29:39.034
- Good job up there tonight.

29:40.413 --> 29:43.172
-I love this shit.
- It shows.

29:43.172 --> 29:46.000
I have your info.
I'll be in touch.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.344
-Looking
forward to it.

30:01.620 --> 30:03.068
- Hey.

30:05.206 --> 30:07.206
- Hey.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.758
- You thinking about doing it?

30:09.758 --> 30:11.379
- Huh?

30:11.379 --> 30:13.206
- Amateur Night.

30:13.206 --> 30:17.068
- I saw you staring
at the flyer inside.

30:17.068 --> 30:18.310
- Oh.

30:18.310 --> 30:20.206
No.

30:20.206 --> 30:21.965
- Why?

30:21.965 --> 30:25.931
I see the way that these
women be checking you out.

30:25.931 --> 30:27.827
Maybe you should?

30:27.827 --> 30:30.275
You'd probably make
some good cash.

30:30.275 --> 30:35.206
- I mean, that's the only reason
I really would do it, the money.

30:36.931 --> 30:38.965
- You in a bind or something?

30:38.965 --> 30:44.103
- Nah, just, gotta find me
a spot soon, and, you know,

30:44.103 --> 30:47.827
stack some money right now.

30:47.827 --> 30:50.000
- If it's something
you want to do,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.793
I think you should do it.

30:52.793 --> 30:56.275
- Need to do.

30:56.275 --> 30:58.482
- I think you made
your decision.

31:15.448 --> 31:16.862
- Your girl is good.

31:16.862 --> 31:19.034
- Yeah.

31:19.034 --> 31:21.689
And the women love her.

31:21.689 --> 31:24.206
We should make her
a junior dancer.

31:24.206 --> 31:26.724
- Yeah, Kat may like that.

31:26.724 --> 31:29.000
- Stop.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.068
- She's good though.
- Yeah.

31:33.068 --> 31:35.827
- Now ain't that some shit?
- What?

31:35.827 --> 31:38.689
-She give that
nigga all her money.

31:38.689 --> 31:42.000
She got to be a
half-ass attorney.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.586
- Well, she's making the money.

31:44.586 --> 31:47.172
- Yeah, but...

31:48.724 --> 31:50.896
- Oh, shit!
-What?

31:50.896 --> 31:52.379
-My judge.

31:52.379 --> 31:56.241
Look, take Ms.
Patty to my office,

31:56.241 --> 32:00.137
and then take the judge to VIP.

32:00.137 --> 32:03.103
I'll distract her.
Is everything good?

32:03.103 --> 32:04.793
- Yes, we are.
- You ready?

32:04.793 --> 32:07.724
- We ready.
- Let's go.

32:07.724 --> 32:09.379
- Excuse me, ladies?

32:10.827 --> 32:13.896
I'm sorry, Ms. Patty.
- Huh?

32:13.896 --> 32:15.551
- Madam would like
to talk to you.

32:15.551 --> 32:17.413
- MS.What I do?

32:17.413 --> 32:19.241
- Right back there,
first door to your left.

32:19.241 --> 32:22.137
- For real?
- Just go talk to her.

32:24.931 --> 32:26.758
- What I do?

32:26.758 --> 32:28.241
- Just go talk to
her, be all right.

32:28.241 --> 32:30.862
- I didn't touch his
balls or nothing.

32:30.862 --> 32:32.758
- Go ahead.

32:32.758 --> 32:35.137
- Damn.

32:35.137 --> 32:37.275
-Babyface, come here.

32:40.275 --> 32:43.379
Go to VIP.
- She showed up?

32:43.379 --> 32:46.413
- Yeah, when your
back was turned.

32:46.413 --> 32:47.896
Make her drink.

32:47.896 --> 32:49.275
- Got it.

32:53.758 --> 32:55.655
-Have a
good time, ladies.

33:01.724 --> 33:03.275
- Come in.

33:05.655 --> 33:08.689
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

33:08.689 --> 33:10.586
Hi. Sit.

33:10.586 --> 33:12.068
- What I do?

33:12.068 --> 33:16.275
- Nothing, sit down.
Just wanna talk.

33:18.862 --> 33:20.689
Here.

33:20.689 --> 33:23.206
- What's this for?

33:23.206 --> 33:27.586
- I just retained
you as my lawyer.

33:27.586 --> 33:29.413
- Whoa!

33:29.413 --> 33:34.068
- So what I'm about to tell you
is client-attorney privilege.

33:35.310 --> 33:36.620
- Okay.

33:36.620 --> 33:39.620
Sounds serious.

33:39.620 --> 33:42.827
- My father has Alzheimer's.

33:42.827 --> 33:44.448
- Oh.

33:44.448 --> 33:46.517
-My sister has
power of attorney over him,

33:46.517 --> 33:51.137
and she is not
taking care of him.

33:51.137 --> 33:54.379
I want some legal advice.

33:54.379 --> 33:55.724
- Okay.

33:55.724 --> 33:57.448
-Go on.

33:57.448 --> 34:00.275
- So if your sister already
has power of attorney

34:00.275 --> 34:01.931
and he is incapacitated--

34:01.931 --> 34:03.310
- Mm-hmm.

34:03.310 --> 34:04.482
- Then the only
thing you could do is

34:04.482 --> 34:07.931
have her sign it over to you.

34:07.931 --> 34:09.827
- That's what I thought.

34:09.827 --> 34:11.965
- Look, I am sorry.

34:11.965 --> 34:13.448
Family law can be
really sensitive,

34:13.448 --> 34:15.724
and maybe you should
just talk to her.

34:15.724 --> 34:18.620
- Yeah, I'll think about that.

34:18.620 --> 34:20.758
- Oh, I am so sorry.

34:20.758 --> 34:22.620
- It's okay.

34:22.620 --> 34:26.034
It's okay. You can go back out
and have a good time.

34:26.034 --> 34:27.275
- Ooh.

34:27.275 --> 34:29.379
-And, Ms. Patty?
- Yes?

34:29.379 --> 34:32.517
- You already know
what I'm gonna say.

34:32.517 --> 34:35.482
Share Babyface.

34:35.482 --> 34:37.275
- You know I just love
him so much, girl.

34:37.275 --> 34:38.689
-I know you do,

34:38.689 --> 34:41.344
but the other ladies
come to see him too.

34:41.344 --> 34:42.827
- Sure.
-All right.

34:42.827 --> 34:45.551
- All right. All right.

34:45.551 --> 34:47.655
So nice in here.

35:17.862 --> 35:19.827
Face!

35:19.827 --> 35:22.137
- Pat! You gotta get out
of here.

35:22.137 --> 35:23.689
- Who the fuck?

35:23.689 --> 35:25.275
Judge Ross?

35:25.275 --> 35:27.068
-You get the fuck out
of here! Get outta here.

35:27.068 --> 35:28.896
- MS.Face!
- Get outta here, now!

35:28.896 --> 35:30.310
- MS.No!

35:30.310 --> 35:33.137
- Fuck! Fuck!

35:34.448 --> 35:35.827
Shit.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.448
- Is the money flowing?
- Yeah.

35:44.448 --> 35:46.724
- Where the money resides.

35:53.206 --> 35:54.758
- What's that shit about?

35:54.758 --> 35:57.206
- Did you let her in VIP?

35:57.206 --> 35:59.517
- See, that's that
weak-ass shit.

35:59.517 --> 36:02.862
Ricky!

36:02.862 --> 36:04.758
Outside, motherfucker.

36:04.758 --> 36:06.517
Get yo' ass out!

36:07.517 --> 36:09.620
I said go, motherfucker!

36:13.068 --> 36:14.896
-You had one
job, motherfucker!

36:18.793 --> 36:19.965
Get the fuck down!

36:21.931 --> 36:24.793
The fuck I tell you to do?

36:24.793 --> 36:26.379
-Enough, Blue!

36:26.379 --> 36:27.724
- No, this motherfucker
trying to make me look bad!

36:27.724 --> 36:29.206
Who the fuck you
think I am, nigga?

36:29.206 --> 36:31.827
- Blue, I said enough!

36:31.827 --> 36:35.172
Come on, the judge is leaving.
Are you ready?

36:35.172 --> 36:37.482
-- Yeah.
-- Let's go.

36:39.517 --> 36:41.068
-Motherfucker!

37:22.931 --> 37:24.827
- Will I see you tomorrow?
-Mm-hmm.

37:24.827 --> 37:26.310
Good night.

37:27.448 --> 37:29.275
-Be careful.

37:43.931 --> 37:45.689
- Oh, shit!

37:47.689 --> 37:49.206
What the hell is wrong with you?

37:49.206 --> 37:51.172
- After everything
I've done for you?

37:51.172 --> 37:52.310
- Pat, listen--

37:52.310 --> 37:53.793
- MS.No!

37:53.793 --> 37:56.137
I'm about to make your
life a living hell.

37:56.137 --> 37:57.827
You hear me, ho?

37:57.827 --> 37:59.344
- You don't even
know what's going on!

37:59.344 --> 38:04.206
- MS.I don't wanna know!
Fuck you!

38:04.206 --> 38:05.793
- Damn!

38:08.724 --> 38:10.793
- Get out of the car, ma'am.

38:10.793 --> 38:12.137
- What?

38:12.137 --> 38:13.172
-Did you not
hear me, ma'am?

38:13.172 --> 38:15.379
Get out of the car.

38:15.379 --> 38:16.965
- I'm a judge.

38:16.965 --> 38:19.103
I know my rights.

38:19.103 --> 38:21.620
- Have you been drinking?

38:21.620 --> 38:23.862
- No.

38:23.862 --> 38:27.000
- I smell the alcohol
from here, ma'am.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.620
Please step out of the car.

38:30.620 --> 38:33.896
Excuse me? Yes, thank you.

38:36.344 --> 38:37.931
- I'm a judge.

38:37.931 --> 38:39.482
- All right, ma'am,
you're under arrest.

38:39.482 --> 38:40.655
Come from behind the door.

38:40.655 --> 38:42.137
- What?

38:42.137 --> 38:43.586
-Come from behind the
door. You're under arrest.

38:43.586 --> 38:45.172
-Wait,
wait, hi, officer.

38:45.172 --> 38:46.793
I own this club right back here,

38:46.793 --> 38:50.517
and this lady is one
of my VIP clients.

38:52.310 --> 38:54.586
- I don't give a fuck.
She's going to jail.

38:54.586 --> 38:56.172
- No, no, I'm a judge!

38:56.172 --> 38:57.724
- Please, please,
wait, listen to me.

38:57.724 --> 39:01.310
I can drive her home, please?

39:01.310 --> 39:02.758
Please.

39:06.931 --> 39:08.586
- Fine.

39:08.586 --> 39:11.206
I will give you a
warning for now.

39:11.206 --> 39:12.655
- Thank you.

39:12.655 --> 39:15.517
-But, judge?
You should know better.

39:15.517 --> 39:18.827
-Hey, thank
you, thank you so much.

39:18.827 --> 39:23.103
- Oh, judge, don't
thank me just yet.

39:23.103 --> 39:25.379
- What?

39:25.379 --> 39:29.103
- Hm, you just
became my new bitch.
