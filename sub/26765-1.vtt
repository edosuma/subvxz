01:33.719 --> 01:34.970
Thank you, guys.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.680
Merry Christmas!

01:38.557 --> 01:41.310
Feel free to take a seat
in front of the backdrop.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.936
I will be with you in a moment.

01:43.729 --> 01:46.732
We're also running a deal where you can
get your pictures printed

01:46.815 --> 01:48.775
on a mug and a T-shirt.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.737
We also do passport photos.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.363
Lots of them.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.104
How's this for a passport photo?

01:57.159 --> 01:59.036
Josh!

01:59.286 --> 02:00.746
You're home! Ah!

02:01.413 --> 02:02.664
What's up?

02:02.914 --> 02:04.124
When did you get back?

02:04.207 --> 02:06.960
- Why didn't you text me
- Just got back just now.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.544
I missed you, punk!

02:08.961 --> 02:09.795
I missed you, too!

02:09.963 --> 02:13.050
You really nailed
this whole backpacking-American,

02:13.467 --> 02:15.552
crashing-in-a-New-Zealand-hostel look.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.971
My hostel was in Amsterdam.
New Zealand was last month.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.682
You're supposed to follow
every single word of my travel blog.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.977
- What happened?
- It's 18 months of words, okay?

02:24.269 --> 02:26.063
I'm looking at the photos, though.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.024
Still working in this place, I see.

02:29.816 --> 02:30.816
Pays the bills.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.320
- Does it feed your soul?
- Nope.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.821
Feeds my belly.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.908
Don't let me interrupt you
not doing your job, Abby.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.744
I need you to take this
to Santa's Village,

02:40.827 --> 02:41.995
on your way home tonight.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.581
Don't tell me.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.418
You didn't forget that Santa's Village
starts tomorrow, did you?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.545
How could I forget?
It's my favorite time of year.

02:50.629 --> 02:51.629
Exactly.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.216
And my outfit.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.426
Are you here to buy something?

02:56.510 --> 02:57.928
No... Boss, Singh.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.889
This is my oldest friend, Josh.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.100
He's the one that got me into photography.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.060
Speaking of...

03:05.394 --> 03:08.563
Remember that film camera,
long ago that we were learning on?

03:08.647 --> 03:09.731
I forgot about that.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.000
- Where is it?
- No idea.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.109
I think it's in a box.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.527
So you're not buying anything?

03:13.735 --> 03:15.095
Oh, no. I'm just here to see Abby.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.906
Then I have a box for you
to take down to my car.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.536
Don't drop anything.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.254
Hey, I'm here.

03:32.671 --> 03:33.880
Hey!

03:35.632 --> 03:36.883
Aunt Abby!

03:37.551 --> 03:38.844
Miss Corinne.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.303
That's quite an outfit.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.304
I dressed myself.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.014
I wanted to look like you.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.184
And she nailed it.
Just for the family Christmas photo.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.936
- Mom is freaking out.
- I bet.

03:48.019 --> 03:48.854
Eggnog?

03:48.979 --> 03:51.648
I put a little something special in there.
I thought you'd need it.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.358
You know me so well, big sis.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.025
Come on!

03:57.612 --> 03:58.655
Hey!

03:58.739 --> 04:00.532
- Yay, hi honey.
- Hey!

04:00.741 --> 04:02.242
What do you think of the tree?

04:02.325 --> 04:04.870
The theme this year is
"ornament splendor."

04:05.704 --> 04:06.705
It's festive.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.603
- Hey, Dad.
<i>- </i> Come on, Abby.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.918
You can help me finish
decorating the mantle.

04:15.672 --> 04:16.672
Looks good.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.429
- So...
- Hm?

04:22.637 --> 04:23.930
How's the car holding up?

04:24.681 --> 04:25.682
Uh...

04:26.933 --> 04:28.393
It's still chugging along.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.395
And the job?

04:31.062 --> 04:32.062
Need money?

04:32.898 --> 04:36.193
I start holiday hours tomorrow,
so I should be good, but thanks, Dad.

04:36.485 --> 04:39.070
He still asks me the same thing,
and I work with him.

04:39.154 --> 04:42.032
I'm just saying you're welcome
to join us at the law firm.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.910
Sarah and I have a great time
working together,

04:44.993 --> 04:46.953
- isn't that right, Sarah-bear?
- Yes, we do.

04:47.078 --> 04:47.913
My darling!

04:47.996 --> 04:48.997
Hey, Mom.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.792
You do know that photography
is a great hobby.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.127
It's just not the safest career choice.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.088
You realize you tell me the same thing
every time I come home, right?

04:57.172 --> 05:00.509
Mm-hm, and that's because we're hoping
that one day you'll actually hear us.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.137
Anyone else want some eggnog?

05:04.429 --> 05:07.224
Nope? Just me?
Okay. I'm gonna top it off.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.602
You are going to change
your clothes for the photograph?

05:10.894 --> 05:11.894
Yes.

05:12.521 --> 05:13.521
Yeah!

05:14.815 --> 05:15.815
Nope.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.568
Gramps, I was wondering
where you were hiding.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.279
Hey, sweetheart.
Come and give your grampops a hug.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.322
Hm-hmm.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.701
Ah, I see you're making your famous chili.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.621
I made a vegetarian one
for you and me. Shh!

05:31.289 --> 05:32.374
A partner in crime.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.918
You have no idea.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.505
- How's it going with your new roommates?
- Ah, they are so boring.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.423
They go to bed by nine o'clock.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.551
Then they complain my music's too loud.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.679
I'm losing my hair and I'm getting old.
How else am I supposed to play it?

05:47.806 --> 05:49.766
- Oh, who's that?
- I'll get it.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.017
Hello?

05:52.227 --> 05:53.228
You made it!

05:53.311 --> 05:56.773
The Sutton decorating parties
are like Christmas cards coming to life,

05:56.857 --> 05:59.025
not the little flimsy dollar-store ones.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.821
- What's going on, son?
- Gramps! Look at you!

06:03.029 --> 06:05.448
- Good to see you, man! Welcome back!
- Good to see you, too.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.409
- Looking good!
- You, too. Back in town, huh?

06:07.492 --> 06:08.743
- I am.
- All right.

06:08.827 --> 06:12.455
Everybody's gonna be so excited
you're here, it'll get them off my back.

06:14.833 --> 06:15.750
Look who I found!

06:15.834 --> 06:18.044
Ooh!

06:18.128 --> 06:20.130
Sutton family, merry Christmas!

06:20.213 --> 06:22.424
It has been so long!

06:22.591 --> 06:25.385
- When did you get back?
- Mmm.

06:26.136 --> 06:26.970
This morning.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.347
- All right, son.
- Good to see you.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.849
What up, man?

06:30.974 --> 06:34.161
- Has he gotten cuter since he’s been away?
- I know what y’all are tryin’ to do.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.271
- It’s not gonna work. We’re just friends.
- Okay.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.106
So Josh, where are you off to next?

06:38.899 --> 06:39.983
I'm here to stay.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.527
What? You didn't tell me that!

06:42.611 --> 06:45.739
Well, I'm staying with Fernando
up until I find my own place,

06:45.822 --> 06:47.574
but one thing I do know is that

06:47.657 --> 06:50.619
it's time for our
Sutton holiday photo!

06:50.702 --> 06:52.054
Let's do it!

06:52.078 --> 06:53.078
Oh, yeah!

06:53.496 --> 06:54.706
All right, yeah, you do.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.208
Oh, y'all look so beautiful.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.254
- Can I get an "ornaments" on three?
- Yes.

06:59.294 --> 07:00.795
One, two...

07:00.879 --> 07:01.880
three...

07:01.963 --> 07:04.090
Ornaments!

07:04.507 --> 07:06.384
Beautiful. Now can I get some smiles?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.845
Smiles is what I need.
I love a smile.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.811
I think we should go
with the silly one. You have to.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.273
Okay, smile.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.360
All right, you bunch of hams.

07:25.737 --> 07:26.737
Abby.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.456
Abby.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.921
I didn't want to give you this
in front of everyone.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.005
So secretive.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.299
I found it when I was packing
my old house.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.425
It was your grandmother's.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.177
She wanted you to have it.

07:49.844 --> 07:50.845
I miss her.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.349
First Christmas without her is tough.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.103
- How you doing?
- She's with me everyday.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.563
I must admit it was hard to move, but,

08:00.814 --> 08:03.483
she wouldn't want me to live
in that big house by myself.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.776
Anyway, enough about me.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.278
- Check it out.
- What is it?

08:08.238 --> 08:10.281
It's an antique advent calendar.

08:10.907 --> 08:15.412
The kind the Europeans used to make
before those flimsy, cardboard-paper kind.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.957
- It's beautiful.
- Mm-hm.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.544
Are you sure she wanted me to have it
and not Sarah?

08:22.627 --> 08:24.713
- Seems more her style.
- Sure I’m sure.

08:26.756 --> 08:27.757
I’m ready.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.591
I’ve got mine.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.593
Yours, too.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.513
Mom thinks I’m literally

08:33.804 --> 08:35.284
- a starving artist.
- Mm-hm.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.792
Son, after all the years I’ve known you,
I’ve never seen you

08:37.851 --> 08:39.686
without a mouthful of cookies.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.813
How am I gonna say "no"
to Miss Judy’s baking?

08:43.023 --> 08:45.108
So, you going to stick around
for a while, right?

08:45.275 --> 08:47.777
- I'm here.
- Josh, I love it when you’re here.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.031
Your appetite distracts Mom
from hounding me about my life choices.

08:51.990 --> 08:55.035
Y'know, she actually asked me
what I thought about your life choices.

08:55.118 --> 08:58.079
So, technically...
you ain’t off the hook <i> yet.</i>

08:58.496 --> 08:59.496
Great.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.085
- I love you, Gramps.
- I love you more, sweetheart.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.169
Thank you.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.589
I'll see you in a few.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.260
So, you’re done traveling.
Retired.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.722
I'm not retired.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.016
I just want to settle down.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.310
Like, find a home base.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.520
Oh, you’re broke.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.063
I’m not broke.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.900
Traveling just gave me a voice
as a photographer.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.110
I know what I want to do.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.486
Lucky.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.989
I’m taking pictures.
Just not the ones I want.

09:33.698 --> 09:34.698
Why not?

09:35.408 --> 09:37.619
Burnt out from being at the studio
all day.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.455
Think I’ve just... lost my spark.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.667
Oh!

09:47.087 --> 09:48.463
I wanna show you something.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.007
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's right up there.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.401
If I could have one thing…

10:12.612 --> 10:13.655
it would be this.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.032
An empty, dark building.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.659
No! A studio space.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.494
Not just for my work.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.789
To showcase other artists.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.583
A place where we could create and...

10:26.126 --> 10:28.086
help support one another and be like...

10:28.878 --> 10:30.839
the center for new talent in the area.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.844
What? Why are you smiling?

10:36.052 --> 10:39.013
Oh, no, I... I like that.
That sounds amazing.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.392
Too bad it’s all talk.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.186
The owner wants a year's rent,

10:46.146 --> 10:47.146
which I don't have.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.734
- So why don’t you just...
- Don’t say “Ask my parents."

10:52.068 --> 10:54.946
I think they’re growing tired
of my starving-artist life.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.113
I might be, too.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.658
You know what? I hate to admit it,

10:58.741 --> 11:02.078
but working at my dad’s law firm
doesn’t sound as terrible as it used to.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.245
Really.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.998
You would suffocate over there.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.668
I’m suffocating now, picturing you...

11:09.127 --> 11:12.255
It’s easy for you to say.
You’ve been traveling the world,

11:12.338 --> 11:16.759
taking photos, inspiring people,
dating interesting people,

11:17.594 --> 11:18.761
while I've been just...

11:20.013 --> 11:22.098
too scared to leave my crappy day job

11:22.182 --> 11:24.809
that I use as an excuse to not take
<i>my</i> kind of photos.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.102
And let’s be honest...

11:27.145 --> 11:28.730
avoid dating people.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.483
I just blurted all that out.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.153
Blame Sarah’s eggnog.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.449
Okay.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.953
Will you help me drop off my bags
before heading to Nando’s?

11:44.662 --> 11:46.164
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.624
As long as you promise

11:48.166 --> 11:49.876
not to turn into an office zombie.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.005
Watch out.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.547
You watch out.

12:08.978 --> 12:09.978
Welcome.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.068
Wow!

12:16.778 --> 12:18.488
This is like a whole new place.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.155
Yeah.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.032
It's cool, right?

12:23.243 --> 12:24.243
Very.

12:28.623 --> 12:32.377
- Look. My picture.
- Oh, you mean <i>my</i> picture.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.963
It’s my picture. I took it. I made this.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.006
Yeah, but you gave it to me. It’s mine.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.801
You know what’s funny?
I got the same thing on my computer.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.387
Ah, look at us. Best friends forever.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.725
Where did all this come from?
This wasn't hanging here before.

12:47.809 --> 12:48.809
No.

12:49.811 --> 12:50.895
You know what I want?

12:52.272 --> 12:55.275
I want to be fearless enough
to go after my dreams, like you.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.446
Look at this photo.
People need to see this.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.908
Yeah, I don’t... I ca... I’m not ready.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.077
And what d'you think
will happen if...

13:06.577 --> 13:08.579
you just let go and went for it?

13:09.247 --> 13:10.247
I don't know.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.625
I don’t know. I’d probably worry less.

13:12.875 --> 13:13.960
I’d have more fun.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.505
Get some of these questions
about my future answered.

13:17.672 --> 13:18.923
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.675
Is that your Christmas wish?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.135
That’s my regular wish.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.432
What was that?

13:29.017 --> 13:31.185
Hey, what is this thing?

13:31.769 --> 13:34.856
It’s like a Christmas doll house…
thing. Wha...

13:34.981 --> 13:38.568
It's an antique advent calendar.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.738
- Nice.
- Yep.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.283
Try and open one of the doors.

13:48.286 --> 13:51.331
I don't know. Maybe it just doesn’t open.
I don’t know. Maybe it’s broke.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.333
Maybe Gramps just gave me
a defective calendar.

13:53.416 --> 13:54.416
Gramps trying to get you

13:54.459 --> 13:56.836
- in the Christmas spirit, too?
- You got somewhere to be?

13:56.961 --> 13:58.561
You’re s'posed to take me to Fernando’s.

13:58.629 --> 14:01.029
Not when you keep talkin’ about
Christmas stuff all the time.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.175
You forgot.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.498
- I didn’t forget.
- You forgot.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.012
Christmas spirit.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.330
Thanks, Gramps.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.744
Let the 24 days of holiday hell begin.

15:34.725 --> 15:35.725
Boots?

15:40.231 --> 15:42.108
Guess you decided to work after all.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.282
Look over here.

15:49.365 --> 15:52.243
Everybody
please be patient. Okay?

15:52.326 --> 15:54.745
Everyone will have their time
with Santa. Okay?

15:55.621 --> 15:56.747
So hold this down.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.835
One at a time.

16:01.169 --> 16:02.920
- Take the picture, Abby.
- I did!

16:03.004 --> 16:03.838
Come.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.121
- There you go, sweetheart.
- Very nice.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.759
That’s very nice.
You keep your list. Okay.

16:09.886 --> 16:13.014
Okay. Who’s the next kid?
Who’s the next in line?

16:13.097 --> 16:14.682
I thought we had extra help this year.

16:14.765 --> 16:18.144
All the college students I hired
got poached by the Christmas train.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.898
That's it.
I'm calling in the cavalry.

16:33.117 --> 16:36.120
Josh! Fernando!
You made it!

16:36.871 --> 16:37.871
Abby!

16:37.997 --> 16:39.081
Santa!

16:39.165 --> 16:42.084
Fernando!
It's such a pleasure to see you.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.420
Okay! Welcome new elves.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.255
You, Elf...?

16:46.631 --> 16:47.965
Elf Josh.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.844
Josh, yes. I know you.
You can help me wrangle the kids.

16:52.053 --> 16:56.015
- Hey, what about me?
- Elf Fernan... do! What can I do?

16:56.098 --> 16:59.018
That kind of enthusiasm gets you
on crowd control.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.604
I also work as a Uber driver,

17:01.687 --> 17:03.648
a dog walker, and a Christmas caroler.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.194
I’m not sure why you told me
about the first two, but...

17:08.277 --> 17:11.989
you can sing to the children
as they impatiently wait in line.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.342
I’m not going to disappoint you, Santa.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.494
Great! Okay, let’s see
some Christmas cheer.

17:18.496 --> 17:19.329
Have fun.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.292
Wanna go see that guy?
You know who that guy is.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.126
Santa Claus. Tell him anything.
Anything you want.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.377
I want candy.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.963
Josh, thanks for this.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.382
I promise overtime and holiday pay.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.677
Stop. I’ve always wanted to be
in an elf costume, so thank you.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.887
- That’s weird.
- A little bit.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.348
That was a good one.
I can feel it.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.226
Let’s go. This job is awesome.
Let’s go.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.852
Anything you want.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.274
Hello, darling.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.860
All done. Next.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.174
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:13.676 --> 18:14.802
Where did you go?

18:15.219 --> 18:17.030
- We were supposed to meet for lunch.
- I know.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.265
- You okay?
- I’m sorry.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.435
Urgent matter. Okay?
Had to go to my apartment…

18:23.185 --> 18:24.186
to grab something.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.441
This is for <i>you!</i>

18:29.650 --> 18:30.735
No!

18:31.402 --> 18:33.279
I didn’t know we were doing presents.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.070
I didn’t get you anything.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.365
You don’t have to.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.243
Plus, I know you’re on this
anti-commercial holiday kick.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.746
Look, it’s not even a Christmas present.

18:42.163 --> 18:45.833
It’s just a gift I’m getting you
around this time of year. Coincidence.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.540
- If you don’t want it...
- I don't want to be rude.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.506
- Can I open it now?
- What you waitin’ on?

18:57.720 --> 18:58.721
I got them in Italy.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.389
Oh!

19:03.184 --> 19:05.186
You shouldn’t have.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.356
- Really. They're like...
- Actually, I should have.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.565
- You know why?
- Why?

19:09.649 --> 19:10.649
Because...

19:11.359 --> 19:13.999
- all this duct tape on your shoes...
- That’s what makes ’em cool.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.654
Okay.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.240
- Okay.
- These are cooler.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.285
- I really love ’em.
- Yeah!

19:21.410 --> 19:22.495
Thank you! I love them!

19:23.079 --> 19:25.122
- I love them so much!
- Ahhh!

19:26.707 --> 19:27.708
I’m glad you like ’em.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.085
They're pretty cool.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.419
Put ’em on now.

19:31.379 --> 19:33.589
Italy, so fancy.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.583
I thought they looked like you.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.432
You know me so well.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.183
Just a little bit.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.018
Little bit.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.233
<i>Christmas tree.</i>

20:43.159 --> 20:44.159
Weird.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.458
Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.250
It opened.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.004
- What opened?
- The calendar.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.631
Yesterday I woke up, and the door
for December 1st was open.

20:57.715 --> 20:58.841
And today, the 2nd.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.303
- Must be on a timer or something, right?
- Was there something cool inside?

21:02.720 --> 21:04.305
Just little toys. But get this.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.598
On the first day,

21:05.890 --> 21:07.266
a pair of boots.

21:07.558 --> 21:09.560
- Boots!
<i>- </i> Boots! It’s crazy, right?

21:09.643 --> 21:10.978
Clearly the calendar is magic.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.520
Clearly.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.397
Guess what I have?

21:15.775 --> 21:16.817
Cookies!

21:17.860 --> 21:18.861
Cookies!

21:18.944 --> 21:20.696
- Oh, yeah.
- What you thought?

21:20.780 --> 21:21.780
Oh!

21:24.700 --> 21:25.701
You better mark your...

21:26.452 --> 21:28.078
non-magical calendar...

21:28.245 --> 21:30.456
But, wait. I want to tell her.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.249
Get ready, because

21:32.333 --> 21:35.836
the greatest Christmas movie of all time
is playing at The Roxy

21:35.920 --> 21:37.213
in a couple of weeks!

21:37.296 --> 21:38.672
<i>Silent Night, Deadly Night!</i>

21:38.756 --> 21:42.551
<i>A Christmas Story.</i>
And the three of us are going together!

21:43.427 --> 21:46.972
Maybe four of us, if I find a girlfriend,
but that’s probably not gonna happen.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.473
Three of us.

21:48.516 --> 21:49.433
Three of us.

21:49.517 --> 21:53.020
It’s amazing because everyone dresses up
as their favorite character.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.730
Oh. I got dibs on the leg lamp.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.273
That’s my costume.

21:56.357 --> 22:00.653
- The leg lamp is <i>my</i> costume. Okay?
- Back off! My idea!

22:00.986 --> 22:03.739
That... is a Christmas tradition
I can get behind.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.980
That tree came out of nowhere!

22:36.146 --> 22:38.691
I'm so sorry.
I guess I didn't tie it down properly.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.934
Who doesn’t tie down a tree
that’s on top of their car?

22:41.235 --> 22:43.863
That would be me.
Are you okay? How’s your car?

22:45.698 --> 22:47.867
- We’re both fine.
- It's my fault.

22:47.950 --> 22:50.830
The guy at the tree farm recommended
bungees, not twine, I didn't listen.

22:50.911 --> 22:54.123
Yeah, well there’s a reason why
twine jumping never caught on.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.625
That's funny.

22:56.750 --> 22:59.230
It's a good sign if you can make bad jokes
at a time like this.

22:59.628 --> 23:00.628
It wasn’t that bad.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.340
I think I killed it.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.433
I’m pretty sure it died
when I chopped it down.

23:07.469 --> 23:08.869
That would make you an ax murderer.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.973
I’m wanted at three different
Christmas tree farms.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.183
I’m gonna have to make a citizen’s arrest.

23:14.977 --> 23:15.977
You got me.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.562
Got any twine?

23:18.230 --> 23:20.441
Okay, you win. I can’t keep up.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.485
Hang on a sec.

23:30.826 --> 23:32.703
Here. Take these.

23:32.786 --> 23:33.786
Oh, I couldn’t.

23:33.829 --> 23:37.082
It’s from my emergency roadside
assistance kit, and technically,

23:37.249 --> 23:38.751
this is a roadside emergency.

23:41.211 --> 23:42.421
Merry Christmas.

23:43.505 --> 23:44.505
Thanks.

23:46.550 --> 23:47.843
Yeah. No problem.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.513
I should probably do this
with a bigger car.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.182
Or get a smaller tree.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.059
Enjoy the holidays.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.561
Yeah, you too.

23:59.563 --> 24:00.563
I will.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.658
<i>A nutcracker?</i>

24:58.831 --> 25:00.457
I'm glad you called.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.376
- You look tired.
- Huh!

25:03.043 --> 25:04.878
I didn’t sleep very much last night.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.673
So, this advent calendar…

25:08.173 --> 25:09.550
What d'you think of it?

25:10.718 --> 25:11.927
Uh, it's interesting.

25:12.720 --> 25:13.929
Can you tell me...

25:14.513 --> 25:15.681
the story behind it?

25:16.640 --> 25:17.975
It was your grandmother's.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.186
She found it in a shop in France
just before we met.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.023
I was on leave from the Air Force.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.859
We passed each other in the entrance
to the Louvre.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.820
She dropped a book in the snow and...

25:31.030 --> 25:32.030
I picked it up.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.033
The rest is history.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.701
So romantic!

25:36.076 --> 25:38.162
I can’t believe I never knew any of this.

25:38.746 --> 25:41.206
This is the time of the year
I miss her the most.

25:41.749 --> 25:44.001
It’s funny,
'cause she was so much like you.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.336
Never bought into all this holiday hoopla.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.089
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

25:49.715 --> 25:50.715
Hello.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.428
Well, it looks like you have
plenty of company, if you want it.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.473
That’s the problem
with having a great love.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.975
The “pretty good” ones
don’t stand a chance.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.352
- Mmm.
- Look...

26:02.436 --> 26:05.647
I’m heading to meet the guys over
at the hobby shop. You want to join?

26:05.731 --> 26:08.108
Just a bunch of old cats
playing with toy trains.

26:08.192 --> 26:11.111
It sounds tempting, but...

26:11.320 --> 26:12.320
I have to work.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.404
All right.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.532
I’ll see you
at Corinne’s Christmas pageant later.

26:15.616 --> 26:19.078
Is that today? Ah, I totally forgot.
Don’t tell Sarah.

26:19.203 --> 26:20.662
- No.
- I’ll be there.

26:20.746 --> 26:21.997
Okay, sweetheart.

26:23.665 --> 26:24.665
Gramps?

26:25.834 --> 26:28.796
That calendar’s just a calendar, right?

26:30.547 --> 26:31.673
What else would it be?

27:09.378 --> 27:11.463
Ah, look at you.

27:12.673 --> 27:13.507
There she is!

27:13.590 --> 27:16.760
Come here! You were so fantastic, Corinne.

27:17.553 --> 27:18.553
So good.

27:19.096 --> 27:22.307
I think I was the only one without
a camera phone in front of my face.

27:22.391 --> 27:23.391
That's true.

27:24.518 --> 27:28.230
You were <i>the best</i> Sugar Plum Fairy
up there.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.233
Okay,
but it’s not a competition.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.110
Everyone is the best
just for participating.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.165
But she was the best by far.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.690
Oops. Watch out, baby.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.117
I'll be right back.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.250
Hey.

27:49.710 --> 27:50.710
Hey.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.421
You look familiar.

27:52.629 --> 27:55.215
By any chance, did you murder my tree
with your car?

27:55.340 --> 27:57.509
First of all, that tree
was already a goner.

27:57.593 --> 28:00.113
Any chance I could get the name
of my accomplice in tree crimes?

28:00.888 --> 28:02.598
Abby, first-time offender.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.057
I'm Ty.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.541
- You have a kid that goes here?
- No way. I don’t have a kid.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.272
I mean yet, anyway.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.025
Don’t get me wrong.
I want kids maybe... one day.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.234
I just haven’t made one yet.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.152
Or anything.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.530
But I do have a niece, Corinne.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.114
Over there,

28:20.449 --> 28:22.451
with the rest of the other staring people.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.912
I don't know who she's talking to.

28:25.829 --> 28:26.829
You?

28:27.623 --> 28:28.623
Already made one.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.375
She's in second grade.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.960
She's around here somewhere.

28:32.294 --> 28:34.254
There she is! Hey, come over here, Jess!

28:34.338 --> 28:37.299
Don’t judge her outfit too harshly.
I’m a single dad with no sewing skills.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.217
Hey!

28:38.300 --> 28:39.300
Hey!

28:40.594 --> 28:41.595
Nutcracker.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.221
How about that?

28:45.057 --> 28:47.577
- I should probably get her home.
- Yeah. No, it’s getting late.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.793
- It was great running into you again.
- So great seeing you.

28:51.605 --> 28:52.605
See you around.

28:53.774 --> 28:54.774
Bye.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.152
- Bye, Jess.
- Bye.

28:57.319 --> 28:58.319
Bye.

29:03.742 --> 29:04.993
Do you know who that was?

29:06.119 --> 29:07.579
Ty hit me with a tree.

29:08.664 --> 29:09.664
Okay.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.668
Ty Walker is the school's
most eligible bachelor.

29:12.751 --> 29:16.088
Amicable divorce, great job,
and that’s all his hair.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.715
Some of the single moms
actually wear their nice yoga pants

29:18.799 --> 29:21.927
to drop off their kids,
all in hopes to get a piece of him.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.513
And here he is,
flirting with my little sister.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.683
God, you’re gonna use this
to lord over them with, aren’t you?

29:27.766 --> 29:30.394
Oh, you have no idea how cutthroat
elementary school is.

29:30.811 --> 29:33.689
Speaking of, I need you to come through
with some awesome

29:33.772 --> 29:36.608
photos for the school’s
charity auction. It’s the 22nd.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.319
- Don’t forget, Abbs.
- No, I would never.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.071
I am gonna crush this auction.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.656
For... the kids, of course.

29:42.739 --> 29:43.739
Of course.

29:45.242 --> 29:47.577
- Are you heading out?
- Yeah. See you guys later.

29:47.661 --> 29:48.495
See ya, honey.

29:48.578 --> 29:49.818
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye.

30:00.549 --> 30:02.301
Yeah. Shh!

30:02.426 --> 30:03.426
Hey.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.891
What's going on with you?

30:10.851 --> 30:12.853
You’re scaring me
with your panicked text messages.

30:12.936 --> 30:15.176
I have to tell you something,
but I need you to not think

30:15.230 --> 30:17.024
that I’m, like, totally nuts.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.444
That ship has sailed.
Can you just tell me?

30:20.944 --> 30:22.487
My calendar’s haunted.

30:23.947 --> 30:24.947
It’s haunted.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.285
Okay, you've been drinking tonight.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.368
Look!

30:31.204 --> 30:33.540
- Oh, the... three little toys.
- Right.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.751
Those are predicting the future.

30:41.048 --> 30:42.716
How much wine have you had tonight?

30:43.425 --> 30:44.425
I want some.

30:44.926 --> 30:45.927
Josh.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.433
Hey. Okay. Day one.

30:52.809 --> 30:53.809
I got boots.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.730
Then you gave me boots.

30:59.149 --> 31:01.651
Yeah, I gave you boots. But...

31:02.694 --> 31:04.196
I got those when I was away,

31:04.279 --> 31:07.032
not because of a freaky calendar
telling me to do so.

31:08.075 --> 31:10.077
And maybe because I'm a wonderful friend

31:10.494 --> 31:11.578
who may expect

31:12.037 --> 31:14.623
- an equally as dope gift in return.
- Josh!

31:14.956 --> 31:17.709
I’m having a breakdown. Focus.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.172
Continue your breakdown.

31:22.964 --> 31:23.964
Day two.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.092
Day two.

31:25.175 --> 31:28.053
Day two, I got a Christmas tree toy

31:28.136 --> 31:31.098
and then the car
ran over a Christmas tree.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.225
How often does that happen?

31:34.643 --> 31:36.520
Right, that is a little weird, but...

31:37.229 --> 31:38.980
that just seems like a coincidence.

31:41.942 --> 31:42.942
Unless...

31:47.114 --> 31:49.074
d'you kick somebody in the nutcracker?

31:50.367 --> 31:51.618
Not yet.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.580
So, tonight at Corinne's pageant,

31:55.831 --> 31:58.917
I met the daughter of the guy
whose Christmas tree I ran over,

31:59.334 --> 32:02.504
and his daughter was dressed
as a nutcracker.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.466
And the strangest part about that is,
I actually hit it off with her dad.

32:07.134 --> 32:08.885
He's <i>really</i> good-looking.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.177
He's divorced.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.555
- His name is Ty...
- Okay.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.515
Enough about dream dad. You...

32:14.307 --> 32:16.393
Are we talking about him
or the calendar?

32:16.852 --> 32:18.728
What else do you think is inside?

32:19.354 --> 32:21.940
I don’t know. The door doesn’t open
until midnight.

32:23.817 --> 32:25.235
Well, I’ll wait up with you.

32:26.945 --> 32:27.945
Thank you.

32:57.851 --> 32:59.186
Morning, sleepyhead.

33:02.647 --> 33:03.647
Morning.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.984
Was thinking about
going to get some water.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.819
You want some water?
I want some water.

33:10.697 --> 33:11.907
Water sounds good.

33:12.908 --> 33:13.908
Abby.

33:20.290 --> 33:21.666
Look!

33:21.875 --> 33:23.585
Ha, ha, ha, you're so funny.

33:24.461 --> 33:26.171
- You did that!
- No, I didn’t.

33:27.547 --> 33:28.757
What’s in it?

33:32.636 --> 33:33.636
Huh.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.140
Okay.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.816
<i>Candy cane.</i>

33:48.568 --> 33:50.320
It looks like
the wind's picking up.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.614
Thank you all for coming
to Santa’s village.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.493
Here’s the card, Abby.

34:00.121 --> 34:02.916
D'you feel like you’re waiting
for something to happen? ’Cause I do.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.715
You know it doesn’t help
that we’re in candy cane central.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.471
Hey, kid,
you ready to go see Santa Claus?

34:16.846 --> 34:19.474
- Please. Do it for Mama, Mason.
- It’s Santa Claus.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.391
Come on.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.937
- Come on, kid.
- I don't wanna go.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.022
Come on. Go up there.

34:26.147 --> 34:27.690
Come up here, my friend.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.694
Get your picture taken with old Santa.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.446
Now look right there in the camera.

34:33.530 --> 34:34.906
I don’t wanna take pictures.

34:35.739 --> 34:38.201
- Ow! Hey!
- Where are your paren... Hey!

34:42.080 --> 34:43.081
Look out!

34:45.917 --> 34:47.418
Arrggghhh!

34:49.504 --> 34:50.504
I've got you, okay?

34:50.714 --> 34:51.547
Ow!

34:51.672 --> 34:52.672
Mason!

34:52.716 --> 34:54.342
- Abby! You okay?
- Come help me.

34:55.342 --> 34:56.342
I'm fine.

34:57.679 --> 35:00.765
No, you might’ve sprained that.
I think you should get that checked out.

35:01.349 --> 35:02.851
It’s no big deal. I’m good.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.644
Stop playing the tough guy.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.290
- Go to the clinic, please.
- There’s a line of people waiting

35:07.314 --> 35:09.375
to get their picture with Santa.
I can't just leave.

35:09.399 --> 35:11.401
Who else do you know
that’s a photographer? Hmm.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.321
I got it. Go. Please.

35:14.988 --> 35:15.988
You sure?

35:16.239 --> 35:19.784
You should go. I can’t have runaway
candy cane injuries on my conscience.

35:22.621 --> 35:23.830
Go!

35:27.751 --> 35:30.962
Says here we have a potential sprain
by candy cane.

35:31.921 --> 35:33.715
A lot of that going around lately.

35:34.716 --> 35:35.759
Hey.

35:36.635 --> 35:37.635
It's you.

35:38.345 --> 35:39.471
In an elf costume.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.390
Yeah, that’s me.
Abby the mortified elf.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.976
Oh, first the tree. Now this.

35:45.477 --> 35:46.728
Christmas is not your holiday.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.314
Ow.

35:51.524 --> 35:52.734
So what’s the prognosis?

35:53.109 --> 35:54.194
Am I gonna live, doc?

35:57.447 --> 35:59.407
Nothing an ibuprofen and a drink
won’t fix.

36:00.033 --> 36:01.033
A drink?

36:01.368 --> 36:02.728
Are you allowed to prescribe that?

36:03.578 --> 36:06.289
That was actually my lame doctor way
of asking you out.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.333
Here’s your prescription.

36:09.084 --> 36:10.084
My cell number.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.795
Wow. And it’s legible.

36:12.462 --> 36:13.463
You sure you’re a doctor?

36:15.256 --> 36:17.217
I’ll see you around 6:00
at Santa’s village?

36:18.551 --> 36:19.386
- Bye now.
- Bye.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.680
- Elf.
- Doctor Ty.

36:41.908 --> 36:42.908
Josh.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.244
- What up?
- Hey.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.327
Hey.

36:45.787 --> 36:46.787
You look happy.

36:48.498 --> 36:50.083
Must’ve got some good meds, huh?

36:50.750 --> 36:52.252
I have a date with Ty tonight.

36:52.752 --> 36:53.837
- Dream dad?
- Mm-hmm!

36:54.963 --> 36:55.963
You’re kidding. How?

36:56.256 --> 36:57.507
He was the clinic doctor.

36:57.841 --> 36:58.883
The calendar called it.

37:00.135 --> 37:02.929
I was thinking of sneaking out
around 5:00 to go home and change.

37:03.012 --> 37:05.098
- Do you think you could cover for me?
- Yeah.

37:05.348 --> 37:06.683
- Really?
- Of course.

37:07.767 --> 37:08.967
- You're the best.
- I got you.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.561
Have fun.

37:10.729 --> 37:11.729
Oh, yeah.

37:18.153 --> 37:19.279
What’s up with Abby?

37:20.947 --> 37:22.031
Yeah, um,

37:23.032 --> 37:24.159
there’s a guy.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.745
There’s a guy?
I thought you were the guy.

37:27.746 --> 37:28.746
Me, too, but...

37:29.456 --> 37:30.623
I’m the friend.

37:30.749 --> 37:31.916
Oooh!

37:33.251 --> 37:34.294
Tough break, buddy.

37:34.377 --> 37:35.253
I’m here for you.

37:35.336 --> 37:36.755
I'm here for you, okay?

37:37.213 --> 37:38.923
- Thank you.
- That sucks.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.675
Ooh. Friend zone sucks.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.585
Well.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.127
Josh,

38:17.420 --> 38:18.420
how do I look?

38:21.674 --> 38:22.926
Just beautiful.

38:23.802 --> 38:24.802
Thanks, Bob.

38:26.638 --> 38:27.638
You look perfect.

38:29.182 --> 38:30.182
You always do.

38:31.768 --> 38:32.768
Abby.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.270
That's him.

38:36.648 --> 38:37.648
That’s him?

38:39.484 --> 38:40.652
He’s not what I expected.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.362
Wish me luck.

38:43.446 --> 38:44.446
All right.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.324
Abby!

38:57.252 --> 38:58.378
Thing we do.

38:59.045 --> 39:00.045
It’s cute.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.174
You got here just in time.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.969
I didn’t know drinks were time-sensitive.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.595
No, but getting there is.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.180
So, I got us this ride.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.892
Are you serious? This trolley?

39:13.810 --> 39:16.980
The nearest café is literally hundreds
of steps away, and it could take us

39:17.063 --> 39:18.648
almost three minutes to walk there.

39:18.731 --> 39:20.483
Plus, I already got us tickets, so…

39:20.900 --> 39:21.943
So, all aboard.

39:23.486 --> 39:24.486
Toot, toot!

39:31.786 --> 39:32.786
Two

39:33.079 --> 39:34.079
peppermint swirl,

39:35.081 --> 39:36.081
hot chocolates.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.252
This is not the drink I had imagined

39:39.335 --> 39:41.212
when you asked me out
on a date, but…

39:42.255 --> 39:43.255
glad you did.

39:43.298 --> 39:44.298
So am I.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.927
So, what else do you do when you’re not…

39:48.219 --> 39:49.219
elfing?

39:50.388 --> 39:51.764
I want to be a photographer.

39:51.848 --> 39:53.016
I mean, I am a photographer.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.099
I work at this...

39:54.225 --> 39:55.560
photography studio.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.980
We take all the holiday photos that are
probably hanging up on your fridge.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.608
But I don’t know how long I’m gonna work
there. I mean, I...

40:02.025 --> 40:03.151
I want to have my own space.

40:05.862 --> 40:07.614
- To do holiday photos?
- No.

40:07.989 --> 40:08.989
No.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.324
Do my own work.

40:11.951 --> 40:12.951
But that’s...

40:13.244 --> 40:15.371
that’s a long way off, I mean,
if it happens at all...

40:15.622 --> 40:16.748
What got you into medicine?

40:17.498 --> 40:19.208
Uh, both my parents are surgeons,

40:19.292 --> 40:20.501
and so is my brother.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.600
So you just got into the family business?

40:22.712 --> 40:26.507
But I’m the rebel for opening a clinic
instead of becoming a surgeon.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.509
You know, my family wishes

40:28.593 --> 40:30.011
I would rebel in that way.

40:34.015 --> 40:35.015
Merry Christmas!

40:35.308 --> 40:36.308
Merry Christmas!

40:38.728 --> 40:39.728
This is fun.

40:40.021 --> 40:41.522
We should do it again sometime.

40:41.606 --> 40:42.607
I’d like that.

40:43.524 --> 40:44.567
Let me see your hand.

40:48.488 --> 40:49.488
This wrap...

40:50.323 --> 40:51.658
can come off tomorrow.

40:52.909 --> 40:54.202
- Doctor’s orders?
- Mm-hmm.

40:57.163 --> 40:58.163
Well, this is me.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.350
I’ve been wanting to kiss you all night.

41:03.336 --> 41:04.587
I was hoping you would.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.309
I'll call you.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.887
- You don’t have my number.
- What are you waiting for?

41:22.480 --> 41:23.480
Just text my cell.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.483
Ah.

41:27.026 --> 41:28.236
Your prescription.

41:28.695 --> 41:30.238
- I’ll talk to you soon.
- Okay.

42:14.782 --> 42:16.868
Say "day off"!

42:17.285 --> 42:19.454
- What’s up? How are you?
- What up?

42:20.413 --> 42:22.415
Looks like you got your photo mojo back.

42:22.498 --> 42:24.459
Meh. That’s debatable.

42:26.127 --> 42:28.713
What’s creepy calendar? Come on.
What did it predict today?

42:29.130 --> 42:31.507
I don’t know. I decided to risk it
and not check.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.009
So you’re tempting your fate.

42:34.010 --> 42:35.344
Interesting strategy.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.681
- Yeah.
- You're so stupid!

42:38.765 --> 42:40.016
Why are you so stupid?

42:41.601 --> 42:43.728
Well, tell me about this ride
with the doc.

42:47.774 --> 42:49.484
You gotta give him points for creativity.

42:49.984 --> 42:50.984
It was cute.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.362
I mean, did the date go well?

42:54.906 --> 42:56.657
I’m seeing him again tonight.

43:21.974 --> 43:22.809
<i>Horse?</i>

43:22.975 --> 43:23.975
<i>No.</i>

43:24.435 --> 43:25.435
<i>Reindeer.</i>

43:28.189 --> 43:29.189
Oh.

44:00.012 --> 44:00.847
<i>A caroler.</i>

44:06.269 --> 44:07.311
Carolers.

45:04.327 --> 45:05.995
Haven’t seen much of you lately.

45:06.704 --> 45:09.749
Is it work or that new fella's
got you so preoccupied?

45:10.333 --> 45:12.376
Now, you know Sarah’s been updating us.

45:12.919 --> 45:14.799
You’re her reality television.

45:15.421 --> 45:17.089
Ty is very exciting...

45:17.632 --> 45:18.632
and very...

45:19.050 --> 45:20.092
- polished.
- Mm.

45:20.468 --> 45:21.302
He keeps...

45:21.469 --> 45:25.264
planning these elaborate dates
and showering me with gifts...

45:25.640 --> 45:27.016
It’s all very...

45:27.099 --> 45:28.142
Overwhelming?

45:30.186 --> 45:32.063
I was gonna say “flattering,” but yeah,

45:32.146 --> 45:32.980
it’s a lot.

45:33.147 --> 45:35.191
We’re spending all this
time together, but...

45:35.858 --> 45:38.653
it’s not like we’re really
getting to know each other.

45:39.487 --> 45:41.632
If you feel like he’s worth
getting to know, you should

45:41.656 --> 45:42.990
do something about it.

45:43.449 --> 45:46.160
You can decide your next step
based on what you learn.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.455
You’re a wise man, Gramps.

45:49.538 --> 45:51.538
- Age equals wisdom.
- Oh, you’re so wise.

45:51.582 --> 45:53.822
- Gluten-free?
- Breakfast of champions

45:57.255 --> 45:59.507
I figured you and him would have gotten
together by now.

45:59.590 --> 46:00.633
You’re kidding.

46:00.716 --> 46:02.635
Josh has girlfriends all over the world.

46:02.718 --> 46:04.345
Yeah, but he came back here, didn't he?

46:04.428 --> 46:07.223
Hey! How about
one of those cookies, son?

46:07.598 --> 46:09.058
I got one with your name on it.

46:09.183 --> 46:10.434
See that? Good man.

46:12.812 --> 46:15.231
Arrrh. Yeah.

46:16.565 --> 46:18.484
- Have some.
- Thank you, son. Of course.

46:18.567 --> 46:19.567
Look at this.

46:20.611 --> 46:22.488
- Ready?
- Look at that. Yeah.

46:22.863 --> 46:24.823
- You got us.
- Caught in the act.

46:37.545 --> 46:39.338
All right, Bob. That’s lunch.

46:39.922 --> 46:41.590
Oh, great. I’m starving.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.304
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

46:46.762 --> 46:47.762
Ready for lunch?

46:48.597 --> 46:51.726
Um, well, we actually took a little vote
and decided

46:51.809 --> 46:53.227
that you can be the leg lamp.

46:54.603 --> 46:55.438
Now?

46:55.521 --> 46:57.241
For the movie,
<i>A Christmas Story.</i>

46:57.315 --> 46:58.357
Tonight at five o’clock.

47:00.318 --> 47:01.318
You forgot.

47:01.610 --> 47:03.529
I have a date, with Ty.

47:04.697 --> 47:06.297
Fine. I will be the leg lamp.

47:06.699 --> 47:08.339
Okay. I just need to find the leg, but...

47:08.409 --> 47:09.243
No.

47:09.410 --> 47:10.703
I can still be the leg lamp.

47:11.078 --> 47:12.478
I’m seeing him at three o'clock, so

47:12.538 --> 47:14.040
I can meet you at the theater after.

47:14.957 --> 47:15.957
Promise?

47:17.001 --> 47:18.001
I promise.

47:18.169 --> 47:20.296
Does this look like a face
that would break a promise?

47:21.964 --> 47:22.964
I'll be there.

47:28.596 --> 47:30.848
I’m stumped. I have no idea
what this date is.

47:34.143 --> 47:35.561
It is the season of giving.

47:37.688 --> 47:39.288
And we’re gonna do a little giving back.

47:39.815 --> 47:40.815
Ah.

47:43.944 --> 47:45.196
I try to come once a month.

47:45.821 --> 47:47.073
Sometimes I bring Jess.

47:47.156 --> 47:49.516
I think it's important for her to know
how fortunate we are.

47:49.700 --> 47:50.951
And you think I need that, too?

47:51.035 --> 47:52.995
We all do. The real reward is

47:53.079 --> 47:55.206
knowing we make life
a little better for these folks.

47:55.790 --> 47:56.790
Wow.

47:56.832 --> 47:59.668
Are saints like you allowed to date
mere humans like me?

48:13.015 --> 48:14.767
Do you think
she’s gonna make it?

48:14.850 --> 48:15.850
Of course.

48:16.310 --> 48:17.895
She said she's gonna come, she’s...

48:17.978 --> 48:18.978
she’s gonna come.

48:19.188 --> 48:20.689
It’s starting soon though.

48:21.107 --> 48:21.941
Come on.

48:22.024 --> 48:24.527
- We have time, man.
- What are you doing with that cell phone?

48:24.652 --> 48:27.738
No one used cell phones
in <i>A Christmas Story.</i>

48:28.197 --> 48:30.449
- It’s 1983.
- Can you get out of character for...

48:30.866 --> 48:31.700
ten minutes?

48:31.784 --> 48:34.912
I don’t know what you’re talking about
because I am Ralphie.

48:36.705 --> 48:37.705
Merry Christmas.

48:42.086 --> 48:44.606
Hey, excuse me. Do you guys mind
if I take some pictures of you?

48:44.672 --> 48:46.215
Oh, you can take mine, but, uh,

48:46.507 --> 48:49.051
don’t take his ugly mug.
It might break the camera.

48:49.677 --> 48:51.397
- Hm-hm.
- Don’t listen to him.

48:51.679 --> 48:53.764
- I was pretty handsome in my younger days.
- Oh...

48:53.848 --> 48:56.267
too bad cameras weren’t invented then.

48:56.851 --> 48:58.102
You guys are old friends, huh?

49:00.229 --> 49:01.814
I’ve been putting up with him for…

49:02.940 --> 49:03.940
I don't know how long.

49:04.567 --> 49:06.026
I have a best friend like that.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.738
Well, what brings you here?

49:10.030 --> 49:11.407
Judge gave you community service?

49:11.949 --> 49:13.242
Good guess, but no.

49:13.325 --> 49:15.035
The guy that I’m dating brought me here.

49:15.578 --> 49:16.579
Oh.

49:17.246 --> 49:18.246
The Boy Scout.

49:18.831 --> 49:21.459
Yeah, we’ve seen him here a few times.

49:21.542 --> 49:25.504
Yeah, he likes to bring people by
and, uh, show ’em how good he is.

49:26.338 --> 49:28.382
He said he brought his daughter here
a few times.

49:29.633 --> 49:31.760
- Ahem.
- Err. Yeah.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.430
I'm going to let you in
on a little secret,

49:34.638 --> 49:37.349
and it's not because you're enamored
by my beauty.

49:38.642 --> 49:40.644
People can show you whatever they want.

49:41.520 --> 49:44.523
But it's how they make you <i>feel...</i>
that counts.

49:45.316 --> 49:47.568
And how
you make them feel, too.

49:48.694 --> 49:49.694
Can't forget that.

49:51.113 --> 49:52.113
Can't forget that.

49:54.617 --> 49:55.784
Ain’t that right?

49:56.452 --> 49:57.828
Oh yeah, let’s do one of these.

50:01.665 --> 50:03.876
<i>You have 30 seconds to answer.</i>

50:03.959 --> 50:06.062
- Josh?
<i>- Which holiday movie has been remade</i>

50:06.086 --> 50:07.171
- <i>the most times?...</i>
- Josh?

50:07.254 --> 50:10.341
<i>...The Night Before Christmas...</i>
- Shh!

50:10.424 --> 50:12.176
<i>- </i> or <i> A Christmas Carol?</i>
- Sorry.

50:12.259 --> 50:14.488
<i>- You have 30 seconds to answer.</i>
- Get... Okay.

50:14.512 --> 50:16.305
Take it!

50:18.474 --> 50:20.234
- You serious?
- God. Sorry.

50:22.478 --> 50:23.478
That's Abby's seat.

50:23.521 --> 50:24.521
Shut up.

50:25.189 --> 50:26.482
That's Abby's seat.

50:26.857 --> 50:28.150
She’s not coming, is she?

50:29.902 --> 50:30.903
Get some good shots?

50:30.986 --> 50:32.321
I think I got some great shots.

50:33.531 --> 50:34.611
So great to meet you.

50:34.657 --> 50:35.937
You too. Have a great Christmas.

50:36.033 --> 50:37.677
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

50:37.701 --> 50:39.221
- Thank you.
- You guys take care, okay?

50:39.245 --> 50:40.245
- Bye.
- Bye.

50:41.914 --> 50:43.499
Looks like you made new friends.

50:43.999 --> 50:45.417
Yeah, they’re really great.

50:46.043 --> 50:48.855
- Have you ever talked to them?
- So many people go through the food line,

50:48.879 --> 50:49.755
it’s hard to remember.

50:49.838 --> 50:52.508
Well, they have a
really interesting history.

50:52.591 --> 50:54.051
They’ve been friends <i>forever.</i>

50:54.134 --> 50:56.214
I try not to get too attached.
It’s the doctor in me.

50:56.679 --> 50:57.679
You hungry?

51:01.600 --> 51:02.702
- Um...
- Everything all right?

51:02.726 --> 51:04.645
Yeah. No. Can we go to the Roxy?

51:04.937 --> 51:06.377
<i>A Christmas Story</i> is playing, and...

51:07.439 --> 51:08.959
- Yeah, of course.
- I should be there.

51:09.191 --> 51:10.191
Yeah, let’s go.

51:34.049 --> 51:35.049
I missed it.

51:35.718 --> 51:37.198
What’s the big deal? It plays nonstop

51:37.261 --> 51:39.381
- all through the holidays.
- My friends are in there.

51:39.972 --> 51:41.473
I said that I would see it with them.

51:43.058 --> 51:45.287
You were doing something
way more important than a movie.

51:45.311 --> 51:46.770
I’m sure they will understand.

51:47.313 --> 51:48.313
It's not the point.

51:56.322 --> 51:57.322
Wow!

51:57.823 --> 51:58.949
This is a great place.

51:59.033 --> 51:59.867
Yeah.

52:00.034 --> 52:01.160
Make yourself at home.

52:01.785 --> 52:02.785
Thank you.

52:05.414 --> 52:07.875
- These are great. Are all these yours?
- Mm-hm.

52:11.712 --> 52:13.392
You’re always taking pictures, aren’t you?

52:15.466 --> 52:17.801
Uh, my friend Josh took that one.

52:18.844 --> 52:19.844
- It’s cute.
- Yeah.

52:20.220 --> 52:21.889
Reminds me of one of Jess’s selfies.

52:23.641 --> 52:25.392
Oh, we have one of these at our house.

52:25.601 --> 52:27.686
- Except ours is made of cardboard.
- Oh, yeah?

52:27.770 --> 52:28.930
Jess loves getting the candy.

52:29.313 --> 52:31.190
Oh, wait. Uh, no, no, no. It’s really...

52:31.357 --> 52:32.677
It’s an antique, so it’s, like...

52:34.068 --> 52:34.943
a little fragile.

52:35.027 --> 52:36.445
What kind of candy is in yours?

52:36.820 --> 52:37.820
Uh,

52:37.905 --> 52:39.239
no candy. It’s just toys.

52:39.948 --> 52:40.948
Uh, like today,

52:41.408 --> 52:42.993
I got the...

52:44.495 --> 52:45.704
Three wise men.

52:46.914 --> 52:47.914
See.

52:48.624 --> 52:50.417
Um, I just...

52:51.585 --> 52:54.880
I just realized something and it shouldn't
surprise me anymore,

52:54.963 --> 52:56.090
but just gets me...

52:56.173 --> 52:57.173
every time.

52:59.259 --> 53:00.386
I'm not following.

53:01.303 --> 53:02.846
Okay... So...

53:03.639 --> 53:04.932
the day that I met you,

53:05.015 --> 53:07.851
I got a Christmas tree toy
from the calendar, and then...

53:08.977 --> 53:11.021
your tree fell on my car.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.192
It's been like that all month long.

53:15.984 --> 53:17.528
Each day a door opens,

53:17.820 --> 53:18.820
and...

53:18.904 --> 53:21.699
the toy inside matches
something that happens.

53:21.782 --> 53:23.200
- Oh, all right.
- Yeah.

53:24.368 --> 53:28.122
Like today, the men at the shelter
were obviously the three wise men.

53:28.330 --> 53:29.456
But there were only two.

53:31.500 --> 53:35.003
It sounds like the Christmas equivalent
of having your horoscope read.

53:35.462 --> 53:38.223
“Oh, I’m a Virgo. My horoscope says
I’m gonna meet someone new today.”

53:38.257 --> 53:40.092
Well, of course, if you leave your house,

53:40.175 --> 53:42.615
the chance of you meeting someone new
increases exponentially.

53:44.763 --> 53:46.515
Did you just mock me?

53:47.349 --> 53:48.934
You mocked me a little. No?

53:49.017 --> 53:51.017
- Come on. It’s kinda funny.
- It’s not funny.

53:52.271 --> 53:54.064
Ah, you’re too smart to believe that

53:54.148 --> 53:56.316
a toy-filled calendar is controlling
your life.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.760
- I’m just being a realist here.
- You’re kinda being a jerk

53:58.819 --> 53:59.819
about it though.

54:01.155 --> 54:02.795
Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?

54:03.282 --> 54:04.533
Hey, Ty, I have a question.

54:04.700 --> 54:05.743
Just be honest.

54:06.118 --> 54:09.288
How many girls have you taken
to see you do good work at the shelter?

54:10.581 --> 54:11.581
Excuse me?

54:11.915 --> 54:15.085
Well, the <i>two</i> wise men seem to think
that’s a common date spot for you.

54:15.544 --> 54:18.144
You’re taking dating advice from two guys
that live on the street?

54:19.089 --> 54:21.675
I thought you <i>cared</i> about the people
at the shelter.

54:21.759 --> 54:24.470
- Or is that just all for show?
- That’s not what I’m saying.

54:28.015 --> 54:29.015
Ty, what do you...

54:29.349 --> 54:30.517
What do you know about me?

54:31.518 --> 54:33.437
That you're gorgeous and talented...

54:33.520 --> 54:34.813
That’s what you know?

54:35.647 --> 54:37.024
What do you <i>know</i> about me?

54:37.232 --> 54:39.067
I mean, what do I even know
about you, right?

54:39.860 --> 54:40.860
We've had these...

54:41.236 --> 54:42.236
postcard-...

54:42.362 --> 54:43.362
perfect dates.

54:46.658 --> 54:49.161
We haven’t even had a real conversation
up until now.

54:49.995 --> 54:51.875
- I thought you were having a good time.
- I am.

54:51.955 --> 54:55.584
But I... You know, I need more than someone
that just looks good on paper.

54:55.667 --> 54:57.085
You know, I need someone real.

54:58.212 --> 54:59.213
You can feel them.

54:59.838 --> 55:01.215
Someone who’s not gonna judge me.

55:02.800 --> 55:04.009
So, what are you saying?

55:04.218 --> 55:05.218
I don't know.

55:11.391 --> 55:13.268
You want to take some space...

55:14.686 --> 55:15.686
a break?

55:15.979 --> 55:17.856
You’re breaking up with me
over a calendar?

55:19.942 --> 55:21.693
I’m just saying…

55:25.239 --> 55:26.239
So, this is good-bye?

55:29.618 --> 55:30.618
My gramps.

55:33.205 --> 55:37.000
I was with my gramps
this morning, okay?

55:38.252 --> 55:40.295
He’s the <i>third </i> wise man.

55:45.425 --> 55:46.425
Whatever.

55:52.015 --> 55:53.141
Merry Christmas, Abby.

56:07.406 --> 56:09.616
You can open up that door

56:09.950 --> 56:11.535
wide as you want.

56:11.994 --> 56:13.787
I'm not looking inside. Hm.

56:14.872 --> 56:15.872
I’m mad at you.

56:17.749 --> 56:18.749
Great.

56:19.334 --> 56:20.878
I’m in a fight with a calendar.

56:21.670 --> 56:22.670
Lost my mind.

56:34.266 --> 56:35.642
What’s up? Got the message.

56:36.059 --> 56:37.144
What’s everyone doing here?

56:37.853 --> 56:39.855
The mayor’s doing
a tree-lighting ceremony.

56:40.898 --> 56:41.898
Why you so late?

56:42.816 --> 56:43.816
I, err...

56:45.068 --> 56:46.068
had a rough day.

56:48.238 --> 56:51.116
I might have, sort of,
broken up with Ty.

56:54.870 --> 56:56.496
You might have? Sort of? You did?

56:56.580 --> 56:57.580
Did.

56:59.458 --> 57:01.585
I made the mistake of showing him
my calendar.

57:02.044 --> 57:03.754
It all went downhill from there.

57:04.546 --> 57:06.256
You want me to go beat him up, or what?

57:06.798 --> 57:09.198
No, he’s probably, like, a black belt
in karate or something.

57:12.220 --> 57:14.348
I feel like a jerk for missing the movie.

57:15.432 --> 57:16.432
You should.

57:18.185 --> 57:20.103
That wasn’t cool, standing me up. That’s...

57:20.729 --> 57:21.730
That's not even like you.

57:22.189 --> 57:24.274
I know.

57:25.442 --> 57:26.442
I suck.

57:29.112 --> 57:30.112
I'm sorry.

57:32.824 --> 57:34.159
I can't stay mad at that.

57:35.619 --> 57:37.287
So, you forgive me?

57:39.331 --> 57:40.999
- Maybe.
- Yes?

57:41.959 --> 57:42.959
You get a hug.

57:43.502 --> 57:44.502
Bring it in.

57:51.510 --> 57:53.387
What are you two standing around for?

57:53.720 --> 57:54.805
The mayor is here,

57:54.888 --> 57:57.307
and her official photographer has the flu.

57:58.100 --> 58:00.894
Grab your camera, Abby.
They’re going to need pictures.

58:02.437 --> 58:03.437
Merry Christmas.

58:06.066 --> 58:06.942
Merry Christmas.

58:07.067 --> 58:09.319
Hello, merry Christmas. Oh!

58:16.827 --> 58:18.870
Okay. Three.

58:19.621 --> 58:21.915
Two. One.

58:25.419 --> 58:27.480
- Merry Christmas, everyone!
- Merry Christmas.

58:41.810 --> 58:43.228
Did you see this one?

58:43.979 --> 58:44.979
Oh, wow.

58:46.023 --> 58:47.023
Look at you.

58:47.941 --> 58:48.775
Abby.

58:48.942 --> 58:49.942
Abby!

58:50.193 --> 58:51.903
Come. The mayor wants to meet you.

58:52.279 --> 58:53.279
Me?

58:53.905 --> 58:55.991
Here. I’ll load it. Go meet the mayor.

58:56.992 --> 58:58.152
- Meet the mayor.
- Go!

58:58.201 --> 58:59.201
Okay.

59:00.746 --> 59:02.626
- Oh, thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

59:03.206 --> 59:05.086
- Thank you.
- What a beautiful night.

59:05.125 --> 59:06.168
Mayor Martinez.

59:07.335 --> 59:09.671
I would like you to meet photographer,
Abby Sutton.

59:09.755 --> 59:10.672
- Oh.
- Hi.

59:10.756 --> 59:11.965
She's a mentee of mine,

59:12.049 --> 59:14.169
and I'm sure you're going
to be pleased with her work.

59:14.676 --> 59:16.928
Thank you so much
for stepping up today, Abby.

59:17.054 --> 59:18.638
I can't wait to see your photographs.

59:18.722 --> 59:20.849
- What else do you shoot?
- Um...

59:21.141 --> 59:23.143
Well, I've been working on a new series.

59:23.935 --> 59:27.230
It's been focusing on capturing the town
in unexpected ways.

59:27.814 --> 59:29.066
Send me a link to your stuff.

59:29.149 --> 59:30.901
I need some fresh images for my office.

59:30.984 --> 59:34.279
- I'd love to see what you have. Okay. Bye.
- Merry Christmas.

59:34.362 --> 59:35.614
Thank... Bye.

59:37.741 --> 59:40.410
Get me the best shots,
and I’ll send them to the mayor

59:40.494 --> 59:42.704
and to the newspaper
before anybody else can.

59:43.330 --> 59:44.330
Of course.

59:44.498 --> 59:45.498
Thank you.

59:48.585 --> 59:49.585
Yes!

59:49.836 --> 59:50.836
Yes.

59:56.635 --> 59:57.635
Josh!

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:03.892
The mayor wants to see my photography.

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:05.352
- For real?
- Yeah!

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.207
It’s the break I’ve been looking for.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.438
Um...

01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:13.693
I don’t like that face.
What’s going on?

01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:15.320
Wh... Why...

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:17.781
When I was trying
to load the card in the computer…

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:18.864
Uh-huh.

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:22.119
...this family came by,
was talking to me,

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:26.123
asking about when Santa Claus
was coming back.

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:28.917
I don't know. I think...

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.044
when they was talking to me, I…

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:33.380
may have accidentally…

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:36.090
cleared the card.

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:39.677
They’re not there.

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:42.514
You erased the card?

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:44.474
It was an accident, okay?

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:47.936
I'm working on recovering the photos, but
there's no guarantee that it will work.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:50.438
You should pack your things and go.

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:53.108
Josh can take over

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:54.818
as full-time photographer.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:56.528
You’re sending me home?

01:00:57.737 --> 01:00:58.737
No,

01:00:58.822 --> 01:00:59.822
I'm firing you.

01:01:15.964 --> 01:01:16.964
Abby!

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.509
Hey! Slow down!

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:22.512
I just heard you talking to Singh.
What did he say?

01:01:24.139 --> 01:01:25.891
Are you going to re-shoot the mayor?

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.434
I would if I didn’t just get fired.

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:30.437
- Seriously?
- Yep! I'm giving my job to you. Congrats.

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:32.104
How? It-

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.691
It was my fault.
Look. I can go tell Singh right now.

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:38.069
It's my card. It's my responsibility.
I'm the one who let it outta my sight.

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:39.571
But you gave it to me.

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:40.989
It's done.

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:43.575
There's no reason for both of us to lose
our jobs.

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:46.203
Wait! Please.

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:49.497
You’re really mad at me.

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:52.709
You knew how much I needed this break,
and now it's ruined.

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:54.377
So yeah, I'm mad at you.

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:57.422
I don't think that's fair.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.634
I would never do anything
to hurt you ever,

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.028
- and you know that.
- I know that

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.638
but I can’t help the fact
that I’m still angry, at <i> you.</i>

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:06.472
You did this!

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:10.602
Between this and...

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:13.188
you standing me up
for Mr. Dream Doctor Dude-

01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:14.355
I said I was sorry!

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:15.397
So am I!

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:18.275
But you know what?

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:23.823
I don’t need you, and I don’t need
this job, and I don’t need any of this.

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:30.003
That’s not how friends
treat each other, Abby.

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:08.428
<i>According to the Weather Center,</i>

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.638
<i>scattered flurries will be continuing...</i>

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:41.627
Not here!

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:44.005
You just answered
so I know you are.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:49.093
<i>Abby!</i>

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:51.471
<i>Abby, it's Sarah.</i>

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.473
<i>Abby, open up!</i>

01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:59.187
Sarah, I really don’t feel like
having any…

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:00.270
Yeah, I know.

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:02.022
...company.

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:03.775
Ew, Abs.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:05.902
It reeks like a pity party in here.

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:07.278
Best kinda party.

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:11.366
- I heard what happened.
- How?

01:05:11.658 --> 01:05:14.911
Gramps. He ran into Josh
while hoofing it down Main Street.

01:05:14.994 --> 01:05:16.788
Great. My personal drama is trending.

01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:19.374
I get it.
Break-ups sucks.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:22.377
And losing a job, even a crappy one,
sucks even more.

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:26.131
But pushing away the people
that care about you is just selfish, Abs.

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:30.359
If you came here to try to make me
feel better, it's not working.

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:32.302
Look at this.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:35.764
<i>You wanna try it?</i>

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.292
<i>- Okay.
- Okay, go ahead.</i>

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:40.769
My baby girl...

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.897
worships you, and no matter how bad
you may...

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:44.274
<i>think</i> your life is,

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:46.234
she’s still going to worship you.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.903
All she’s been talking about is
how her cool Aunt Abby

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:50.907
is bringing her pictures
to the auction tomorrow.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.368
Can I please just send the photos
with you?

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.452
I really...

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:58.663
I really don’t want to see anyone,

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.207
especially Ty. I do not want to see him.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.209
I figured you’d say that.

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:05.420
Which is why I’m here to tell you
to get it together.

01:06:05.545 --> 01:06:07.464
Because I will not let you
disappoint Corinne,

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:09.881
and I definitely
won’t let you give up on yourself.

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:13.887
You know you’re my favorite sister,

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:17.182
- I think I’m your only sister.
- Okay. Go take a shower.

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:18.349
Take a shower, Abby.

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:20.810
You smell like Cheetos and sadness.

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:26.190
Love you.

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:27.232
Love you, too.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:54.968
Okay.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.120
Excuse me?

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.332
Sir? Excuse me.

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:26.834
Is this place no longer for rent?

01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:28.211
If the deal goes through.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.725
Hey, Kevin. Where's Sarah?

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:49.690
Hey, sis.

01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:51.109
Hey.

01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:52.192
Thanks.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:56.239
Your tough love worked. I decided to stop
feeling sorry for myself and...

01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:57.489
join the living.

01:07:57.824 --> 01:07:59.075
Now, this is my sister.

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:00.368
I have a surprise for you.

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:02.495
For the auction.
I think you’re gonna like it.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:04.246
Where is it?

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:05.956
It’s in the car.

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:07.788
Watch this.

01:08:08.543 --> 01:08:09.543
Hey, Laurie.

01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:12.255
My sister’s donations are in her car.

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:13.482
- They're in the trunk.
- Okay.

01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:14.340
In the trunk.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.104
Can you get someone
to unload them, please?

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:17.385
- Yeah. For sure.
- Thanks.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:23.433
You’re having way too much fun
throwing your PTA president power around.

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:03.930
Santa’s right there. I’m so excited.

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:07.142
Take it.

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:11.537
Come.

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:17.528
If you're looking for Josh,
he's not here.

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:19.613
He's not?

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:21.866
He quit. After I fired you,

01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:24.702
he came around talking about solidarity,

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:27.121
how you took the fall for him.

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:28.706
I can’t believe Josh quit for me.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:30.332
Take it.

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:36.089
I wanted to give this to you.

01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:40.301
It's the pictures
from the tree-lighting ceremony.

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:42.845
I wasn't able to salvage all of them,
but there might be...

01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:45.014
ones on there that you can use.

01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:47.100
I mean, it’s probably too late, but...

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:49.018
I’ll send them to the mayor’s office.

01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:51.229
I’m sorry about what happened.

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:53.063
You know,

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.899
it’s going to be
a Christmas massacre here,

01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:57.485
if these people don’t get their
Santa photos.

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.612
Uh, Mrs. Singh, the lens cap.

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:02.365
You don't have to tell my wife
what to do, Bob.

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:04.367
Take off the lens cap.

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:07.995
And if you want your old job back,
it is yours.

01:10:08.413 --> 01:10:09.247
I, uh...

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:12.792
I appreciate every opportunity
that you’ve given me, Mr. Singh, but I...

01:10:14.293 --> 01:10:15.878
I think it's time for a change.

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:18.922
Okay.

01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:23.176
Okay.

01:10:29.183 --> 01:10:31.227
Aunt Abby! You made it!

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:32.310
Hi, Corinne!

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:37.607
Abby.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:40.778
Your pictures are wonderful.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:42.655
We are so proud of you.

01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:44.365
You are?

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:46.826
Honey, I know we’ve been hard on you,

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:49.191
but it’s only because your father and I
want what’s best.

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:51.497
And seeing your works on display

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:53.624
and the effects that they're
having on everybody,

01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:57.505
it's obvious to us now that you're doing
exactly what you're meant to do.

01:10:58.129 --> 01:10:59.969
We’re just sorry we didn’t
recognize it sooner.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.968
Okay, I’m sorry.
I need you just for one second.

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:05.051
Sorry, guys.

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:06.470
Okay.

01:11:08.181 --> 01:11:09.640
I hope it's okay,

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:12.351
but I included a photo session with you
as part of the auction.

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.647
That photo? You used that photo?

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:17.940
It’s beautiful. Stop it.

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:19.859
People have been bidding on it like crazy.

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:22.904
I’ve even been giving out your info,
so you are gonna have a lotta work

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:24.280
coming your way in the new year.

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:27.492
Thank you.

01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:29.410
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:30.619
You did amazing.

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:34.289
Have you seen Gramps?

01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:35.792
Oh yeah, he's in the auditorium

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:37.043
bidding on more of your art.

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:43.674
There’s my photography superstar.

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.929
- Sweetheart, these are very impressive.
- Thanks.

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:49.263
I am so proud of you.

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:50.931
So proud.

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:55.018
Oh.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.771
That's a lot of feelings.

01:11:57.855 --> 01:11:58.855
You doing okay?

01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:01.609
Yeah. I’m just in shock over all this.
That’s all.

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:05.947
That answer might work for some people,
but not me.

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:10.535
The first person I want to tell is Josh.

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:13.621
I think I messed up.

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:17.792
It’s too late to fix it.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.524
But you already knew that, didn’t you?

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:29.762
It wouldn’t be much of a friendship
if you gave up now,

01:12:31.222 --> 01:12:32.222
would it?

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:38.770
Okay.

01:12:40.982 --> 01:12:41.982
All right.

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:44.694
I need to go do the mature thing.

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:48.864
Thanks.

01:12:57.498 --> 01:12:58.749
Girl is growing up.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.149
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:24.733
Abby.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.234
Ty.

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:29.030
I wondered if I'd see you here.

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:30.655
Here I am.

01:13:32.033 --> 01:13:33.713
- Um, about the other...
- I want to say...

01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:35.119
- You first.
- Go.

01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:36.202
Okay.

01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:39.539
You're a good guy.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.085
Sorry, it didn't work out,

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:45.254
but I had fun,

01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:46.796
a lot of fun.

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:49.383
I’ve been dumped before.

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.602
You don’t have to try to make me
feel better.

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:52.845
Okay. Fair enough.

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:56.390
For what it’s worth,
you did warm me up a little to...

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:58.643
all this Christmas stuff, so…

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:00.936
Yeah, good on you.

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:04.981
I was outta line...

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:06.691
making fun of you.

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:10.446
I guess I didn't understand how much
that whole calendar thing meant.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.907
I appreciate you saying that.

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:15.743
Merry Christmas, Ty.

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:17.535
Merry Christmas.

01:14:33.928 --> 01:14:34.928
<i>Tradition,</i>

01:14:36.263 --> 01:14:37.263
<i>friendship,</i>

01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:40.016
<i>and love.</i>

01:14:41.102 --> 01:14:43.729
<i>Those are the most important things...</i>

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:46.607
- This is beautiful!
- <i>that we could ever give each other.</i>

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:58.159
Hello.

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:00.037
Hey Fernando. It’s Abby.

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:01.998
Hey, Abby. How are you?

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:03.456
Hey.

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:05.208
Are you crying?

01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:07.795
It's allergies. I have allergies.

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:09.630
Okay. Um...

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:13.050
I hate to be this person.
Is Josh with you?

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:14.468
I think he’s on a date.

01:15:14.552 --> 01:15:15.552
He’s on a date.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:16.846
With who?

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:19.181
I don’t know. I saw him
wearing his date shirt.

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.182
Date shirt?

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:23.429
<i>Yeah, you know, the shirt a guy wears
when he wants to make a good impression?</i>

01:15:24.145 --> 01:15:25.145
A clean shirt?

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:27.189
Not one that’s off the floor?

01:15:27.898 --> 01:15:28.898
Um.

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:30.359
Okay.

01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:32.111
Or he's in Florida visiting his parents.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.863
I mean, it's a versatile shirt, really?

01:15:34.905 --> 01:15:37.867
Well, which is it, Nando? Is it Florida?
Is he on a date?

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:39.618
Okay, hold on one sec.

01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:45.624
<i>Okay, his backpack is gone,</i>

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.334
so he's definitely in Florida.

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.210
<i>Bye.</i>

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:04.578
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:06.645
I just checked the trunk of my car.

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:08.355
And it's empty.

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:11.567
I think some things in my trunk that I
didn't plan on donating

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.486
may have gotten donated.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:14.403
Like what?

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:17.031
Like my... A box of gifts from Ty.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:18.406
My calendar.

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:20.576
I've been looking everywhere.
I can't find it.

01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:22.828
I think Laurie might have grabbed it.

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:24.515
Okay, Laurie wouldn't do that.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:27.500
Hey, I just... That’s not even
what I care about.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:28.583
Yeah, obviously.

01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:29.626
I just...

01:16:30.628 --> 01:16:32.546
Gramps’s calendar was in there.

01:16:35.049 --> 01:16:37.301
I mean, is there any chance
it’s still here?

01:16:37.384 --> 01:16:40.679
Yeah, well, we cleaned out. I mean,
this was our biggest auction yet.

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:42.181
Don't joke. Can you check?

01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:44.016
Maybe there’s a receipt or something.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.100
Okay.

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:49.188
The Christmas calendar was sold...

01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:51.232
to an anonymous buyer.

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:53.691
Great.

01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:55.318
Don't worry, Abby.

01:16:55.486 --> 01:16:56.737
I'll keep looking for it.

01:17:39.405 --> 01:17:41.073
<i>This is Josh. Leave a message.</i>

01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:43.074
Hey, it's me.

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:47.163
I totally deserve the silent treatment.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:50.416
You’re right. I’ve just been
too wrapped up in myself

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:52.042
to be a good friend, but I, uh...

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:54.961
Will you call me?

01:17:56.922 --> 01:17:57.922
Come back.

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:02.386
I really want to make things right.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:05.764
I can't imagine
not having you in my life.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.033
So, what have we got here?

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:29.454
All right.

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:34.668
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:36.670
- Hello.
<i>- Please hold for the mayor.</i>

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:42.092
Abby. Nice to talk to you again.

01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:45.179
Uh, h-hi. Mayor Martinez,

01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:47.640
it’s so nice to-What a surprise!

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:50.184
Before you say anything,
I just want to say I feel so terrible

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:52.519
about the tree-lighting photos, and, um,

01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:54.897
hopefully, the recovered photos worked.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.190
Tree photos?

01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:58.817
Oh, those. We had to go
with another submission,

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:01.237
but that’s not why I’m calling.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.697
I was at my son's school auction

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:05.824
and saw your inspired photos.

01:19:06.533 --> 01:19:08.013
You did? But I was there. I didn’t...

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:09.745
I guess I must have missed you.

01:19:10.204 --> 01:19:11.997
I bid on the photo session with you
and won.

01:19:13.123 --> 01:19:14.208
<i>I know it’s last minute,</i>

01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:16.691
<i>but is there any chance
you could do the session later today?</i>

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:19.129
It's the last time I have free
before heading out of town.

01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:20.213
Yes!

01:19:20.297 --> 01:19:22.007
Yes, of course!

01:19:23.801 --> 01:19:26.011
But I... I’m sorry.
I don’t have a studio.

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:27.721
That's okay. We can do it at my home.

01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:30.057
I'll have my assistant send you
all the information.

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:33.185
- I look forward to seeing you again.
- You, too.

01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:35.103
Bye, Mayor.

01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:40.149
Hi.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:41.609
Thank you.

01:19:43.153 --> 01:19:44.655
Abby. Welcome.

01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:46.156
Thank you, Mrs. Martinez.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.240
I hope you're ready.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:50.077
I have a house full of family
and they all love the camera.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:50.995
Perfect.

01:19:51.078 --> 01:19:53.664
<i>Lindo. </i> Nice. Good.

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:54.831
Just lean in.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.280
- Everyone say, <i>“¡Feliz Navidad!”
- ¡Feliz Navidad!</i>

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:58.960
Perfect.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.047
Yeah, that’s perfect.
D'you wanna get in there, too?

01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:09.054
You have a really wonderful family,
Mayor Martinez.

01:20:09.179 --> 01:20:10.931
Well, we're all fans of yours.

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:13.997
I have a feeling we’ll be working together
more in the future.

01:20:14.685 --> 01:20:15.685
I hope so.

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:17.604
Thank you so much for coming.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:18.980
Merry Christmas.

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:22.067
I love fixing these old cameras.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.821
- All right, now it’s as good as new.
- Woo! Merry Christmas.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.721
Corinne, honey. You have one gift left.

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:53.474
Oh, another gift? Well.

01:20:56.143 --> 01:20:57.263
Oh! It’s a camera!

01:20:57.311 --> 01:20:58.937
So, I, uh...

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:02.858
I have a confession.

01:21:05.235 --> 01:21:06.779
That calendar that you gave me.

01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:08.572
There was a little mix-up,

01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:11.158
and it got sold at the school's auction.

01:21:13.327 --> 01:21:14.327
Okay.

01:21:15.746 --> 01:21:16.746
That's it?

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:18.623
You're not...

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:22.002
angry? I mean, it was Grandma’s,
and I lost it.

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:24.296
It'll find its way back.

01:21:25.422 --> 01:21:28.092
Your grandmother was convinced
it had magical powers.

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:30.719
She said it brought her to me.

01:21:31.428 --> 01:21:33.013
What do you think about that?

01:21:33.097 --> 01:21:34.097
I believe it.

01:21:35.182 --> 01:21:37.518
That's exactly why she wanted it
to go to you.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.437
Just like her, you pick the hardest path,

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:43.690
whether it’s in your career choice
or in your personal life.

01:21:44.525 --> 01:21:46.110
She knew the time would come

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:48.529
where you would need
just a little extra help

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:50.155
getting all your wishes.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.367
Everything you’re working so hard for.

01:21:53.867 --> 01:21:56.245
She didn't want you
to give up on your dream.

01:21:59.123 --> 01:22:00.374
It didn't work for me.

01:22:02.126 --> 01:22:03.669
Are you sure about that?

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.631
You came back to me.

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:18.118
<i>I came back for you.</i>

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:23.916
<i>- The three little toys.
- Those are predicting the future.</i>

01:23:25.042 --> 01:23:30.964
<i>Day two, I got a Christmas tree toy,
and then my car ran over a Christmas tree.</i>

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:42.726
<i>Says here we have a potential sprain
by candy cane.</i>

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.394
<i>- Hey.
- It's you.</i>

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:51.068
<i>And his daughter
was dressed as a nutcracker.</i>

01:23:51.818 --> 01:23:54.029
You can help me wrangle the kids.

01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:01.327
You look perfect,

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:03.287
like you always do.

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:46.081
- Hey!
- Hi, honey.

01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:47.374
Hey. Where’s uh...

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:49.751
Where’s Gramps?

01:24:49.835 --> 01:24:51.753
He’s in the kitchen making a cup of tea.

01:24:51.837 --> 01:24:53.338
Do you want to help me set the table?

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:54.880
Uh…

01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:56.215
Gramps?

01:24:57.634 --> 01:24:59.074
Where did that come from?

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:02.222
Josh. He dropped it by earlier
this morning.

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:05.100
He also dropped off
a whole tin of Christmas cookies

01:25:05.183 --> 01:25:06.268
all the way from Florida.

01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:16.861
Gramps.

01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:18.529
Gramps,

01:25:18.739 --> 01:25:19.990
the calendar came back.

01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:22.491
Okay.

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:24.286
And Josh is back in town.

01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:28.874
- You were in on it?
- In on what?

01:25:29.249 --> 01:25:30.249
You know what.

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:32.127
Did you help Josh buy back that calendar?

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:33.503
Nah, that was all me.

01:25:34.087 --> 01:25:37.341
I came in early to help Sarah set up,
and I saw it sitting in a pile.

01:25:38.425 --> 01:25:40.135
But Josh gave it back to me, right?

01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:43.263
Ah. Now, that question’s not for me
to answer.

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:45.265
But what I can tell you is

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:47.643
the holiday calendar watches over you.

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:50.895
Gramps,

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:53.398
is the calendar magic or not?

01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:55.566
Well,

01:25:56.026 --> 01:25:57.486
some might call it magic,

01:25:57.903 --> 01:25:59.196
some might call it fate.

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:02.532
Either way you define it,
it ends up in the same place.

01:26:03.784 --> 01:26:06.745
Speaking of which, now you need
to get going or you’re gonna be late.

01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:14.336
You’re a sneaky one, Gramps.

01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:16.505
Ah, I prefer to call it romantic.

01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:18.422
Now get.

01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:20.007
Sneaky!

01:26:20.467 --> 01:26:21.587
Romantic.

01:26:47.244 --> 01:26:48.244
Abby?

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:54.458
Josh?

01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:10.851
I thought I lost you.

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:13.645
I came back for you.

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:16.063
Both times.

01:27:17.524 --> 01:27:18.692
And I will every time.

01:27:20.694 --> 01:27:23.405
I can’t believe how long it’s taken me
to realize that it’s you.

01:27:26.408 --> 01:27:27.993
It’s always been you.

01:27:34.624 --> 01:27:35.624
So...

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.336
what was in the calendar today?

01:27:41.173 --> 01:27:42.173
Snowflake.

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.181
I got something for you.

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:02.443
For me?

01:28:11.912 --> 01:28:12.912
Finally.

01:28:14.164 --> 01:28:16.833
You took all my hints and got me a gift.

01:28:18.084 --> 01:28:19.084
Open it.

01:28:21.046 --> 01:28:22.589
You wanna get out of the cold first?

01:28:23.757 --> 01:28:24.757
Okay.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:27.301
No.

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.011
- What?
- Come here.

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:33.974
Wait. In here?

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:36.603
Oh, we can’t break and enter.

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:00.043
What are we doing here?

01:29:01.294 --> 01:29:02.294
Well,

01:29:03.129 --> 01:29:04.756
I mean with a little bit of work...

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.968
Welcome to your studio.

01:29:10.262 --> 01:29:11.262
That’s funny.

01:29:11.888 --> 01:29:13.306
Okay. Welcome to our studio.

01:29:14.224 --> 01:29:15.224
We're partners.

01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:16.851
50/50,

01:29:17.227 --> 01:29:18.227
if you want.

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:19.270
This is ours?

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:20.938
This is ours?

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:23.441
How? You can’t afford this?

01:29:23.817 --> 01:29:25.485
I can’t afford this.

01:29:25.819 --> 01:29:29.197
Why are you under the impression
that I’m this broke artist?

01:29:29.281 --> 01:29:32.242
Because you wore an elf costume
and you were living at Fernando’s.

01:29:32.325 --> 01:29:34.077
You still haven’t read my travel blog.

01:29:34.744 --> 01:29:35.744
Still.

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:37.037
I’ll get to it.

01:29:39.416 --> 01:29:41.501
After a few months being away,
I started freelancing.

01:29:42.294 --> 01:29:44.796
If you didn’t know, I’m a big deal
in the travel blog world.

01:29:45.922 --> 01:29:47.799
So you used that money to rent this place?

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:50.092
I bought it.

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:52.262
I mean, with the help...

01:29:52.846 --> 01:29:54.723
of my parents and your Gramps.

01:29:55.348 --> 01:29:56.558
He put a good word in for you.

01:29:58.977 --> 01:29:59.977
Thank you.

01:30:03.148 --> 01:30:04.441
These are happy tears.

01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:07.735
I swear.

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:21.625
You found it?

01:30:21.708 --> 01:30:22.792
I found it.

01:30:23.627 --> 01:30:24.836
And you put film in?

01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:26.171
I’m kind of a big deal.

01:30:28.048 --> 01:30:29.048
Well,

01:30:29.215 --> 01:30:30.215
say,

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:31.842
I love you.

01:30:36.723 --> 01:30:37.723
I love you, too.

01:31:14.928 --> 01:31:18.098
All right. One. Two. Three.

01:31:33.113 --> 01:31:34.906
Everyone, we just have an announcement.

01:31:35.448 --> 01:31:38.410
- Just wanna wish you a...
- ...merry Christmas!
