[Knife plunging]

00:40.807 --> 00:41.840
You could have killed me!

00:42.074 --> 00:44.209
How many times
do I have to say I'm sorry

00:44.243 --> 00:45.711
for shooting you in the ass?

00:45.745 --> 00:47.579
It was an accident.
When are you gonna let it go?

00:47.614 --> 00:50.549
When I can sit on my ass
without using a pillow.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.518
So, I take it
there's been little progress

00:52.552 --> 00:54.085
since our last session.
[Laughs]

00:54.120 --> 00:55.521
No, not with his trust issues.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.455
I don't have trust issues.
[Scoffs]

00:57.490 --> 00:58.389
He has jealousy issues.

00:58.423 --> 01:00.892
Okay, for the last time,
I am not jealous

01:00.926 --> 01:03.027
that you passed
the sergeant's exam.

01:03.061 --> 01:04.861
Tell that to the hole in my ass.

01:06.765 --> 01:08.599
The one that he put there,
not the... I'm sorry.

01:08.634 --> 01:10.367
Detectives, please. I'm sorry.

01:10.402 --> 01:14.704
You two depend on each other
for your lives out there.

01:16.140 --> 01:18.709
But from what I am seeing...

01:18.743 --> 01:20.243
I'm sorry,
but I am going to recommend

01:20.277 --> 01:21.678
that the two of you split up
as partners.

01:21.713 --> 01:23.580
No, no... no. No, don't
do that, doc. No.

01:23.614 --> 01:25.682
Yeah, there's got to be
something else that we can try.

01:25.717 --> 01:27.884
Well... [Sighs]

01:27.918 --> 01:29.953
Maybe you could use
some sort of a buffer.

01:29.987 --> 01:31.221
A buffer?

01:31.255 --> 01:32.788
A buffer?

01:32.823 --> 01:35.558
Hey, boys! How is it going?

01:35.592 --> 01:37.960
I'm sorry, Castle. Man, you can't
work this case with us, bro.

01:37.994 --> 01:40.028
Yeah, I'm not here
about the case.

01:40.063 --> 01:43.399
Tomorrow is the first wedding
anniversary for Beckett and me,

01:43.433 --> 01:45.468
and I was just hoping
that you could distract her

01:45.502 --> 01:47.403
while I set up a surprise
in her office.

01:47.437 --> 01:48.503
I don't know, Castle.

01:48.537 --> 01:50.405
Beckett doesn't want you
hanging around the precinct.

01:50.439 --> 01:51.639
It's just a little surprise.

01:51.674 --> 01:53.408
Castle, nothing you do is little.

01:53.442 --> 01:55.477
Yeah. Probably come in
riding on an elephant.

01:55.511 --> 01:57.245
And then he takes her
and the elephant

01:57.279 --> 01:58.346
up in a hot air balloon.

01:58.381 --> 01:59.213
[Laughter]

01:59.248 --> 02:00.849
Well, the first anniversary's paper,

02:00.883 --> 02:02.650
but otherwise,
that's not a bad idea.

02:02.685 --> 02:04.619
Wait a minute.

02:04.653 --> 02:06.086
We're not arguing.

02:07.389 --> 02:08.689
- He's our buffer.
- He's our buffer.

02:08.723 --> 02:12.359
Uh... Let me guess...
A little trouble in therapy?

02:12.394 --> 02:14.961
Yeah, well, we need someone
to follow us around

02:14.996 --> 02:16.597
and keep us from fighting.

02:18.366 --> 02:21.702
I would love to, guys,
but my schedule is just so...

02:21.736 --> 02:23.503
We'll help you
with your little surprise.

02:23.537 --> 02:25.805
Congratulations.
You got yourself a buffer.

02:25.839 --> 02:27.940
Let's go solve a case.

02:28.475 --> 02:31.644
Hello, Lanie.
You are looking lovely today.

02:31.678 --> 02:33.513
I look lovely <i>every</i> day, Castle.

02:33.547 --> 02:35.481
And no, you cannot see the body.

02:35.516 --> 02:37.784
Why does everyone assume
I'm here about the case?

02:37.818 --> 02:39.718
It's okay, Lanie. He's with us.

02:39.752 --> 02:41.453
So, what do we know
about our victim?

02:41.487 --> 02:42.521
Name's Scott McCoy.

02:42.555 --> 02:45.290
According to neighbors,
he's an unemployed actor.

02:45.324 --> 02:46.458
Sure had the looks for it.

02:46.492 --> 02:48.727
At least the killer spared his face.

02:48.761 --> 02:50.061
His body, though... Euggh.

02:50.095 --> 02:51.730
Nine separate entry wounds.

02:51.764 --> 02:55.033
Lividity puts the stabbing
between midnight and 2:00 A.M.

02:55.067 --> 02:57.701
Nine entry wounds? That sounds
like a crime of passion.

02:57.736 --> 02:58.669
Yeah, either that

02:58.703 --> 03:00.738
or someone wanted to be
really, really sure.

03:00.772 --> 03:04.475
And we may have an idea
of who that someone is.

03:04.509 --> 03:07.411
The weapon was wiped clean,
but CSU found prints

03:07.446 --> 03:09.513
on the knife block
where the killer got it.

03:09.548 --> 03:11.381
Waiting to hear
if they're in the system.

03:11.416 --> 03:12.716
All right, I'll follow up with CSU.

03:12.751 --> 03:15.485
Ryan, why don't you grab a couple
of unis and start a can... vass?

03:15.519 --> 03:17.219
What?

03:17.254 --> 03:18.220
[Sighs]

03:18.255 --> 03:20.022
Oh, I get it.
I didn't say "pretty please."

03:20.057 --> 03:20.957
I didn't say anything.

03:20.991 --> 03:22.525
You don't <i>have</i> to say anything.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.427
You just mope around
like your dog died.

03:24.462 --> 03:26.329
Castle, you're supposed to be
our buffer. Buff.

03:26.363 --> 03:27.764
Right. Um...

03:27.798 --> 03:29.398
Okay, guys, role playing...

03:29.433 --> 03:31.700
Each of you take
the other's point of view.

03:31.734 --> 03:34.603
This is a time-tested method
of conflict resolution.

03:34.637 --> 03:36.071
I think that's a dumb-ass idea.

03:36.105 --> 03:37.673
You haven't even tried it yet.

03:37.707 --> 03:39.541
Oh, no, I-I was being Espo.

03:39.576 --> 03:41.209
Oh. That's good.

03:41.243 --> 03:42.511
Even you have to admit
that was good, Espo.

03:42.545 --> 03:44.079
Only, you didn't say "yo."

03:44.113 --> 03:46.582
Yo, I just got a hit
on those prints.

03:46.616 --> 03:48.415
Guy's name is Anton Ford...

03:48.450 --> 03:50.217
In the system for felony assault.

03:50.251 --> 03:52.453
Assault? Well, jeepers.

03:52.488 --> 03:55.222
I hope he's not mean to me.
I'm very sensitive.

03:56.257 --> 03:57.892
Oh, I get it.
Yeah, h-he's being me.

03:57.926 --> 03:59.293
Yeah, that's pretty funny.

03:59.327 --> 04:01.095
He did nail the walk.

04:01.129 --> 04:03.197
Yeah, his physicality's
pretty good.

04:04.165 --> 04:05.765
[Cellphone beeps]

04:11.572 --> 04:14.107
Yo, cap. We got an update
on that suspect.

04:14.141 --> 04:15.174
Anton Ford.

04:15.209 --> 04:17.611
Not only were his prints
all over the crime scene,

04:17.644 --> 04:20.146
but he had a history
with our vic... Scott McCoy.

04:20.180 --> 04:22.715
Scott's credit card makes him
a regular at a bar in midtown.

04:22.749 --> 04:24.750
We checked... the bouncer said
that two nights ago,

04:24.784 --> 04:26.652
Scott and Anton
got into a full-on brawl.

04:26.686 --> 04:28.487
And that wasn't the first time
that these two went at it.

04:28.522 --> 04:29.454
Last month, same bar,

04:29.489 --> 04:31.490
and in each instance,
it was over a woman.

04:31.525 --> 04:33.726
So, Anton was a lover
<i>and</i> a fighter.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.728
Yeah, but apparently,
not very good at either.

04:35.762 --> 04:37.462
Both times,
our victim kicked his ass

04:37.497 --> 04:38.997
and went home with the girl.

04:39.031 --> 04:41.499
Which means Anton
could have been out for revenge.

04:41.534 --> 04:42.734
Yeah. Unis are
bringing him in now.

04:42.768 --> 04:45.136
[Knock on door]
Hey. How are my favorite crime solvers?

04:45.170 --> 04:46.604
Hey! What brings you here?

04:46.639 --> 04:48.272
Oh, you said
that I could come back,

04:48.306 --> 04:50.141
retrieve that
stolen painting... remember?

04:50.175 --> 04:53.144
Yeah, uh, you know,
you'll just have to go

04:53.178 --> 04:54.946
to the admin clerk
on the second floor

04:54.980 --> 04:56.279
to fill out some paperwork.

04:56.313 --> 04:57.948
[Sighs] Thanks.

04:57.982 --> 04:59.449
Oh, and it's so nice to see

04:59.483 --> 05:01.251
that Rick's back
working cases again.

05:06.824 --> 05:07.758
Um... Yeah.

05:07.792 --> 05:10.027
Uh, what makes you say
that he's working cases?

05:10.061 --> 05:11.227
Hmm?

05:14.197 --> 05:15.631
So, admin clerk, second floor.

05:15.666 --> 05:16.933
Thank you.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.705
He is our buffer.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.839
He's your buffer?

05:23.874 --> 05:25.808
Anton: Get the hell off me!
Go on! Take these cuffs off!

05:25.842 --> 05:26.842
And he's our suspect.

05:26.877 --> 05:28.844
Get the hell off me! Get off!

05:28.879 --> 05:32.047
Go on! Take these cuffs off!
See how tough you are!

05:32.081 --> 05:34.049
You think that badge
makes you special?!

05:34.083 --> 05:35.349
That's our suspect?

05:35.384 --> 05:36.484
Anton: I didn't do nothing!

05:36.518 --> 05:38.219
How does that mountain of a man

05:38.253 --> 05:40.521
get beaten up
by our human-size Scott?

05:40.556 --> 05:41.856
Twice.

05:41.891 --> 05:42.958
Hi, Castle.

05:42.992 --> 05:44.325
Hey.

05:44.359 --> 05:46.294
Hey. Oh, I'm not here
about the case.

05:46.328 --> 05:47.661
I'm just, uh...

05:47.696 --> 05:48.963
- A buffer?
- Yeah.

05:48.997 --> 05:50.898
Yeah, they told me... Sort of.

05:50.932 --> 05:52.633
So, what is this? For therapy?

05:52.667 --> 05:55.135
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

05:55.169 --> 05:56.637
Well, good luck
on your interview.

05:56.671 --> 05:57.638
[Snaps fingers]

05:57.672 --> 06:00.540
Oh, hey, um, Beckett, uh,
about the interview...

06:00.575 --> 06:02.009
Would you mind doing it with me?

06:02.043 --> 06:04.644
Three's a crowd
in an interrogation.

06:07.547 --> 06:08.848
Sure. Fine.

06:13.754 --> 06:16.689
We are go for operation booyah.
Repeat... we are go.

06:19.927 --> 06:21.693
Wow.

06:21.728 --> 06:24.997
"Little surprise,"
my wounded ass.

06:30.404 --> 06:31.987
Ryan: You got
quite the temper, Anton.

06:32.014 --> 06:33.016
When provoked.

06:33.056 --> 06:34.773
Is that what happened
the other night at the bar...

06:34.807 --> 06:36.103
You were provoked?

06:36.743 --> 06:38.876
Wait. I'm...
I'm here for a bar fight?!

06:38.911 --> 06:39.844
Come on, man!

06:39.878 --> 06:41.646
If you're dragging people
in here for that,

06:41.680 --> 06:44.248
you're gonna have to arrest
half the guys in New York.

06:44.282 --> 06:47.885
Except half the guys in New York
didn't kill Scott McCoy.

06:49.220 --> 06:52.189
And given all of the witnesses
who saw him beat you up...

06:52.223 --> 06:54.158
Twice.
- ...you had motive.

06:54.192 --> 06:56.660
Plus, your fingerprints
are all over his apartment.

06:58.563 --> 07:01.731
[Voice breaking]
My fingerprints are there because...

07:01.766 --> 07:03.166
Because...?

07:04.602 --> 07:07.604
Because we were friends.

07:07.638 --> 07:09.739
Oh, Scott.

07:13.877 --> 07:15.878
Yo, Castle, you done yet?

07:15.912 --> 07:17.513
Castle: Almost.

07:19.248 --> 07:21.216
[Beep]

07:23.319 --> 07:25.354
[Beep]

07:42.137 --> 07:44.772
The fight was staged...
Both of them.

07:44.807 --> 07:46.607
Why were they staged?

07:46.641 --> 07:48.341
To help Scott pick up women.

07:49.978 --> 07:51.545
You never heard of a wingman?

07:51.579 --> 07:53.246
A wingman who gets beat up?

07:53.280 --> 07:54.347
It was just one of our tactics.

07:54.382 --> 07:58.051
See, if the target seemed like
she was into macho guys,

07:58.085 --> 08:00.654
I'd hit on her first,
real aggressive.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.422
And Scott would
come to her rescue.

08:02.456 --> 08:05.290
Yeah, by "kicking my ass."

08:05.325 --> 08:06.559
So he was a pickup artist?

08:06.593 --> 08:07.627
You could call it that.

08:07.661 --> 08:10.062
Scott was into
rich, married women.

08:10.096 --> 08:12.231
And why would he target
married women?

08:12.265 --> 08:13.298
What was his game?

08:13.333 --> 08:14.466
I don't know.

08:14.501 --> 08:16.468
He paid me not to ask.

08:18.438 --> 08:21.272
You think you can describe
any of these women?

08:25.678 --> 08:26.645
I need more time.

08:26.679 --> 08:28.046
Okay.

08:29.715 --> 08:30.782
Hey.

08:30.816 --> 08:32.616
How'd it go with Anton?

08:32.652 --> 08:33.451
Ryan will fill you in.

08:33.485 --> 08:35.520
I'd rather... hear it from <i>you.</i>

08:35.554 --> 08:37.655
Oh, it's that bad
between the two of you?

08:37.688 --> 08:38.455
Yeah.

08:39.791 --> 08:42.359
So, uh, we're gonna
look into Anton's alibi,

08:42.393 --> 08:44.494
but we don't think
he was our doer.

08:44.529 --> 08:46.163
Turns out he was
actually helping our Vic

08:46.197 --> 08:48.498
pick up rich, married women in bars.

08:48.533 --> 08:49.567
So, you think
one of these ladies

08:49.601 --> 08:51.368
got ahold of a knife
and went all psycho on him.

08:51.402 --> 08:52.937
Or one
of their jealous husbands.

08:52.971 --> 08:55.104
You know, Beckett...

08:55.138 --> 08:57.040
Anton remembers
some of those women's faces,

08:57.074 --> 08:58.975
so I-I think it would be a good idea

08:59.009 --> 09:00.810
if we got him
with a sketch artist.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.011
Don't you think?

09:02.046 --> 09:03.446
Yeah, and we will do just that

09:03.480 --> 09:05.448
just as soon as you let me
get into my office

09:05.482 --> 09:06.683
so I can make that call.

09:06.717 --> 09:07.810
- Right.
- Now, may I?

09:09.235 --> 09:12.217
Hey, Beckett. One more thing.

09:12.269 --> 09:13.755
Yes?

09:15.524 --> 09:17.025
Nice shoes.

09:17.894 --> 09:19.628
Hey. What'd I miss?

09:21.566 --> 09:22.965
Oh. That's mine.

09:22.999 --> 09:25.266
It's, uh... Australian money.

09:46.721 --> 09:47.654
[Beep]

10:09.776 --> 10:11.409
Castle, this is very sweet.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.912
This is... very you.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.015
But...

10:16.049 --> 10:17.750
I don't think
that it would be a good idea.

10:17.784 --> 10:21.753
Look, I-I know we're on
a time-out right now a-and...

10:21.787 --> 10:24.188
But tomorrow's our anniversary,
and I just can't bear

10:24.222 --> 10:25.923
the thought of spending it
without you.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.759
I would love to.

10:27.793 --> 10:28.926
I really would.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.796
You have... no idea how much.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.475
But I, um...

10:33.528 --> 10:35.666
I'm worried
that it would be unfair.

10:36.868 --> 10:39.002
Because no matter
how great dinner would be,

10:39.036 --> 10:41.672
I would still need our time-out.

10:41.706 --> 10:42.639
No. No, I know.

10:42.674 --> 10:44.675
I'm not trying to put an end
to the time-out.

10:44.709 --> 10:46.543
I'm just saying,
what if we could...

10:46.578 --> 10:48.545
Have a time-out
from our time-out?

10:48.580 --> 10:49.646
Exactly.

10:50.982 --> 10:52.482
So, what do you think?

10:54.485 --> 10:56.719
I would love to have dinner
with you tomorrow.

10:57.721 --> 10:59.021
[Knock on door] Got a sec?

10:59.055 --> 10:59.989
Hmm?

11:01.057 --> 11:03.693
I found something odd
in our victim's financials.

11:03.727 --> 11:04.527
What?

11:04.561 --> 11:06.696
Direct deposits
from a shell corp.

11:06.730 --> 11:08.764
There's a bunch of them...
5 grand each.

11:13.636 --> 11:15.804
The last deposit was made
three days ago.

11:15.838 --> 11:17.438
That's the same day
that Anton said

11:17.473 --> 11:20.542
he and Scott worked their bit
on that woman in the bar.

11:20.576 --> 11:21.610
[Papers rustle]

11:21.644 --> 11:22.377
You know what?

11:22.411 --> 11:24.245
Most of these payments line up

11:24.279 --> 11:26.247
with when Anton said
Scott hired him.

11:26.281 --> 11:30.450
Sounds like Scott wasn't picking
up on married women for fun.

11:30.485 --> 11:32.486
Sounds like he was
getting paid for it. But why?

11:32.521 --> 11:33.353
Don't know.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.222
I haven't found much
on the shell corp,

11:35.256 --> 11:38.458
but they do list an address...
A pricy apartment uptown.

11:38.493 --> 11:40.661
And when I called
the building manager,

11:40.695 --> 11:42.462
he said Scott rented it
a year ago.

11:42.497 --> 11:44.831
Okay, so, our victim is
an out-of-work actor

11:44.865 --> 11:47.066
getting mystery money
from a mystery corporation,

11:47.100 --> 11:48.635
and now
there's a mystery apartment.

11:48.669 --> 11:50.069
That's a lot of mysteries.

11:50.103 --> 11:51.437
What the hell was this guy into?

11:51.471 --> 11:53.773
Whatever it was,
it might have gotten him killed.

12:06.519 --> 12:07.986
Surprise.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.102
Oh!

12:18.136 --> 12:21.671
This place is so much nicer
than Scott's other apartment.

12:22.105 --> 12:23.839
Bet he would rather
have died <i>here.</i>

12:23.873 --> 12:25.107
Yeah, but why did he need it?

12:25.142 --> 12:28.723
And what did it have to do
with that shell corp that was paying him?

12:29.979 --> 12:32.214
Ryan: These drawers
are all empty.

12:32.249 --> 12:34.050
Strange...
It's like he only wanted

12:34.084 --> 12:35.584
to make it <i>look</i>
<i>like he lived here.</i>

12:35.618 --> 12:37.186
Maybe this is
where he was knocking boots

12:37.220 --> 12:38.554
with the married ladies.

12:38.588 --> 12:40.355
Sherlock homeboy's got a theory.

12:40.389 --> 12:42.623
I'm sorry.
What did you just say?

12:42.658 --> 12:45.427
I said, "this place
is really eerie."

12:45.461 --> 12:47.195
- That is not what you said.
- Okay. Time-out.

12:47.229 --> 12:49.064
Guys, in my official capacity as buffer,

12:49.098 --> 12:50.898
I'd like to recommend
that we try something.

12:50.933 --> 12:51.999
No more role-playing.

12:52.034 --> 12:54.569
No, this is something
my second wife, Gina, and I

12:54.603 --> 12:55.636
used to do to avoid arguments.

12:55.671 --> 12:58.038
Instead of blurting out
whatever was on our minds,

12:58.073 --> 12:59.973
we would write it down
to revisit it later.

13:00.007 --> 13:01.942
So nothing's said
in the heat of the moment.

13:01.976 --> 13:02.842
Exactly.

13:02.877 --> 13:04.778
See, we found,
with a little perspective,

13:04.812 --> 13:06.380
what seemed so important to us
at first

13:06.414 --> 13:08.449
was often quite trivial...

13:08.483 --> 13:10.084
Sort of like our marriage.

13:10.118 --> 13:12.086
Okay. I'm game if <i>you</i> are.

Hey, I've got something.

13:27.634 --> 13:29.168
Castle: Well, well, well.

13:29.203 --> 13:31.269
Looks like this shell corporation

13:31.304 --> 13:33.438
was paying Scott
to seduce rich, married women

13:33.473 --> 13:35.073
and get proof of their trysts...

13:35.108 --> 13:36.441
Most likely to blackmail them.

13:36.476 --> 13:37.675
That's quite a racket.

13:37.710 --> 13:38.676
Maybe a deadly one.

13:38.711 --> 13:41.746
Looks like someone did not enjoy
getting screwed.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.116
Out of their money, that is.

13:44.150 --> 13:47.485
There's no S.D. card in here.

in the memory. Let's see.

[Printer whirring]

13:58.497 --> 14:00.030
Yeah, that's Scott in bed
with a woman,

14:00.064 --> 14:01.798
but you can't see her face.

14:01.833 --> 14:04.001
No, but look what you <i>can</i> see.

14:05.669 --> 14:07.003
I think that's her elbow.

14:08.005 --> 14:09.372
No, not that.

14:09.406 --> 14:11.141
The tattoo
on the small of her back...

14:11.175 --> 14:12.509
It's a dragonfly.

14:12.543 --> 14:14.043
We can use that to I.D. her.

14:14.077 --> 14:16.712
How? Are we gonna do
a butt lineup?

14:16.747 --> 14:17.713
[Cellphone beeps]

14:17.748 --> 14:20.049
As fun as that does sound,
we might not need to.

14:20.083 --> 14:21.850

14:24.086 --> 14:26.721
So, where are you with
matching Vulcan Simmons' heroin

14:27.657 --> 14:29.824
Nowhere.

14:30.993 --> 14:32.861
Which is why I think

14:32.895 --> 14:35.030
you going out to dinner
with Castle is a mistake.

14:35.064 --> 14:36.365
I know.

14:36.399 --> 14:37.533
But I miss him.

14:37.567 --> 14:39.200
[Sighs] I get it.

14:39.234 --> 14:41.702
But if you let him in and he
figures out what we're doing...

that Anton provided,

we were able to I.D.
one of Scott's recent targets...

Annika Smythe.

14:53.948 --> 14:55.915
Wait... the socialite wife
of that hedge-fund guy?

14:55.949 --> 14:58.051
Isn't she in the tabloids all the time?

14:58.085 --> 15:00.220
Which is how we recognized her
and how we know

15:00.254 --> 15:01.988
that she's going through
a messy divorce.

15:02.022 --> 15:02.955
You know Annika.

15:02.990 --> 15:05.192
Now meet Nancy Underwood
and Claire Stevens...

15:05.226 --> 15:06.993
Both loaded
and going through divorces.

15:07.027 --> 15:10.397
There's a picture of all three of them
at a fundraiser last week.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.698
So they know each other?

15:11.732 --> 15:13.265
Castle: Oh, more than that.

15:13.300 --> 15:14.266
They hang out together.

15:14.301 --> 15:16.101
Matter of fact,
according to Annika's Instagram,

15:16.135 --> 15:17.570
they're going to a spa later.

15:17.604 --> 15:19.205
And you know
what this means, Beckett...

15:19.239 --> 15:21.207
It's a murderous first wives club.

15:21.241 --> 15:22.557
You think
they did this together?

15:22.607 --> 15:23.728
Why not?

15:23.761 --> 15:25.544
Scott blackmails the ladies.

15:25.579 --> 15:26.445
When they refuse to pay,

15:26.479 --> 15:27.966
he shows the photos
to their husbands.

15:27.999 --> 15:29.614
Who promptly divorce them.

15:29.648 --> 15:32.283
So all three women
band together to kill Scott

15:32.318 --> 15:33.685
for ruining their marriages.

15:33.719 --> 15:35.235
It is the perfect theory.

15:35.284 --> 15:37.395
Except it's completely
unsubstantiated.

15:37.445 --> 15:38.790
That is...

15:38.824 --> 15:40.292
True.

15:40.326 --> 15:41.960
But we can just have them in
for questioning.

15:41.994 --> 15:44.329
Based on what... the plot
of the "first wives club" movie?

15:44.363 --> 15:45.897
[Laughing] No. Of course not.

15:45.931 --> 15:46.897
There was no murder in that.

Yes.

will be on full display.

Yeah. I bet we're not
the only ones celebrating.

Come on, guys.
We're here to relax.

There's only one way to be sure.

[Hayley sighs]

16:56.397 --> 16:59.132
Well, I think that you and your
husband are just in a rut.

[Beckett sighs]
It's just become comfortable.

17:02.804 --> 17:04.971
And I don't want comfort.
I want edge.

17:05.006 --> 17:07.941
Ooh. Then you got to spice
things up a little, sweetie.

17:07.974 --> 17:09.209
Get yourself a tattoo.

17:09.242 --> 17:10.810
[Gasps] Men love ink.

17:10.844 --> 17:12.845

17:14.079 --> 17:16.315
Oh, come on. That's not true.

17:16.348 --> 17:18.983
You're wrong. Tattoos are hot.

We should introduce you to Ivan.

Beckett: A genius?

17:22.454 --> 17:25.324
I mean, that sounds like
a little bit of a stretch.

Wait.

17:28.359 --> 17:30.862
Don't I know you from somewhere?

17:30.896 --> 17:33.698
Yeah. You're married
to that writer, aren't you?

had anything on us,

Mm.

Well... time to get dressed.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.727
Yeah, but before we go,
can you please give me

18:40.762 --> 18:41.962
the number
of your tattoo artist?

18:41.997 --> 18:44.098
You're right...
The guy's a bloody genius.

18:47.409 --> 18:50.492
And when you I.D.'d the tattoo,

18:50.591 --> 18:54.631
did you pull the towel off,
or did it just... fall off?

18:54.713 --> 18:56.824
Well, actually,

18:56.849 --> 18:59.661
But I'm not quite sure
how this is relevant.

18:59.710 --> 19:02.316

Wow.

19:03.668 --> 19:05.089
So, Hayley, it must have been
pretty hard

19:05.124 --> 19:06.589
for you guys to chase her

19:06.671 --> 19:09.160
'cause you and Beckett
were both wearing towels, right?

19:09.194 --> 19:12.430
Hey. Okay, here you go.
This is your voucher.

19:12.460 --> 19:15.365
Just take that up to evidence,
and that painting is yours.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.334
All right. I'll see you perverts later.

19:17.368 --> 19:19.039
Yes, you will.

19:20.872 --> 19:23.707
Ryan was trying to get details
on your wardrobe malfunction.

19:23.742 --> 19:25.709
Me? You were the one asking
if Beckett was wearing a towel.

19:25.744 --> 19:26.911
That was for the report.

19:26.945 --> 19:29.712
I thought Castle was helping
you guys resolve this conflict.

19:30.428 --> 19:31.681
Yeah.

19:31.747 --> 19:32.782
Then he went home.

19:32.816 --> 19:34.651
Well, I have a suspect to interview,

19:34.685 --> 19:38.021
and the two of you
need to figure this out.

19:39.322 --> 19:40.857
[Sniffs]

19:43.260 --> 19:44.460
What are you doing?

19:44.494 --> 19:46.529
What Castle said...
Writing it down.

19:46.563 --> 19:48.697
Trust me...
I got a lot to write.

19:49.732 --> 19:52.100
Hope my pen
doesn't run out of ink.

19:53.502 --> 19:55.336
Yes, I slept with Scott.

19:55.371 --> 19:58.707
And yes,
he took photos, obviously.

19:58.741 --> 20:00.542
And then he used them
to blackmail you.

20:00.577 --> 20:02.544
Blackmail? Where are you
getting that from?

20:02.579 --> 20:05.345
Well, how else
did your now-ex-husband

20:05.380 --> 20:06.814
end up with these photos?

20:06.848 --> 20:09.684
Because my ex hired Scott
to sleep with me.

20:09.718 --> 20:12.553
The same thing happened with
all of us... Annika and Claire.

20:12.588 --> 20:15.089
You see, our husbands
wanted to trade us in

20:15.123 --> 20:16.323
for younger trophy wives

20:16.357 --> 20:18.192
without having to pay
through the nose.

20:18.226 --> 20:20.494
Oh, because you guys
had infidelity clauses

20:20.528 --> 20:22.161
in your prenups.

20:22.196 --> 20:24.831
My night with Scott
cost me $12 mil.

20:26.133 --> 20:27.200
You do realize

20:27.234 --> 20:29.970
that you just gave me a motive
for Scott's murder.

20:30.871 --> 20:32.572
I didn't kill him.

20:32.607 --> 20:33.707
His neighbor I.D.'d you.

20:33.741 --> 20:35.875
He said that you were
standing outside the building

20:35.910 --> 20:37.776
at midnight
just before Scott was killed.

20:37.811 --> 20:40.579
So, do you want to tell me
what really happened?

20:41.982 --> 20:44.850
The night that we had together

20:44.884 --> 20:49.354
was something I hadn't
experienced in a long time.

20:49.388 --> 20:53.792
And to find out that I was
just another paycheck...

20:53.827 --> 20:56.127
So I went to confront him.

20:56.161 --> 20:57.895
But I didn't even
get to yell at him.

20:57.930 --> 21:00.564
He apologized to me
before I could get a word out,

21:00.599 --> 21:03.300
said he was a horrible
human being for what he'd done.

21:03.335 --> 21:06.704
And why did he have
this sudden change of heart?

21:06.739 --> 21:08.706
He said that he had
learned something

21:08.741 --> 21:11.742
working his last job...
Something upsetting.

21:11.776 --> 21:14.077
So, did he tell you
what his last job was?

21:14.112 --> 21:17.080
It was another seduction,
but he didn't say who...

21:17.115 --> 21:19.816
Just that he had screwed over
a good person

21:19.851 --> 21:22.273
and he wanted to make it right...

21:22.701 --> 21:24.387
Or die trying.

21:26.445 --> 21:28.758
So, Nancy's car-service driver confirms

21:28.792 --> 21:31.226
that our Vic was alive
when Nancy left.

21:31.261 --> 21:33.595
He helped her into the car
at 12:15.

21:33.630 --> 21:36.766
Then the driver took Nancy
all the way out to Greenwich.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.700
Okay. So she's not our killer.

21:37.734 --> 21:39.501
Maybe Scott's murder
has something to do

21:39.536 --> 21:40.636
with that last job
he was working.

21:40.671 --> 21:42.905
Let's see who Scott screwed over
and what he was doing

21:42.939 --> 21:44.674
to make it right
the night that he was killed.

21:44.708 --> 21:47.608
And I think
I know where to start looking.

21:47.643 --> 21:50.311
Nancy's husband and his friends
all used the same lawyer

21:50.345 --> 21:51.646
to bust up their prenups...

21:51.681 --> 21:53.414
Some hotshot
named Lindsey Trent.

21:53.448 --> 21:55.349
The <i>Ledger</i> <i>just did a piece on her...</i>

21:55.384 --> 21:58.153
The divorce attorney
to the rich and shameless.

21:58.187 --> 21:59.954
You know, if she was the one
that was hiring Scott,

21:59.989 --> 22:01.756
she would know
what his last job was.

22:01.791 --> 22:02.657
Well, yeah, but there's no way

22:02.691 --> 22:04.357
she's gonna talk to us
without a warrant.

22:04.392 --> 22:06.760
Which we won't get... not unless
we have something concrete

22:06.795 --> 22:07.695
to tie her to all this.

22:07.729 --> 22:09.663
I'll call the riding D.A. in the morning.

22:09.698 --> 22:11.631
We'll brainstorm on how to get
a warrant. I'll see you guys.

22:13.201 --> 22:14.301
[Sighs]

22:14.335 --> 22:15.769
We need to go at this another way.

22:15.804 --> 22:17.470
You know...

22:17.505 --> 22:20.740
Maybe the way to find out
about Scott's last seduction

22:20.774 --> 22:23.576
is with a seduction of our own.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.712
Right.

22:26.947 --> 22:28.414
I have no idea what you mean.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.115
Okay.

22:31.218 --> 22:33.352
So, let me get this straight.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.722
You want me to see
a divorce attorney...

22:35.756 --> 22:37.889
Tomorrow,
on my wedding anniversary.

22:37.924 --> 22:38.890
To pose as a client.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.893
Martha: No, no, no.
I don't think so, Richard.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.328
Does Katherine know about this?

22:43.362 --> 22:46.497
Uh, no, no.
And, um, she's not going to.

22:46.532 --> 22:49.601
Best to give her, uh,
plausible deniability

22:49.635 --> 22:51.336
in case this sting goes sideways.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.503
[Beeping]

22:52.538 --> 22:54.939
Though I do love a good sting.

22:54.973 --> 22:56.240
What would you need him to do?

22:56.274 --> 22:57.775
You know how lawyers keep a log

22:57.809 --> 22:59.543
of all the hours
they spend on each client?

22:59.577 --> 23:02.713
Sure. They keep track of their
time down to the minute.

23:02.748 --> 23:05.249
<i>And</i> of every expense incurred
on each case.

23:05.283 --> 23:06.917
Just like hiring Scott.

23:06.952 --> 23:08.886
So if I get a look
at the last few days

23:08.920 --> 23:11.020
in this logbook of Lindsey's,

23:11.055 --> 23:12.856
we can figure out Scott's last job.

23:12.890 --> 23:14.991
So... are you in?

23:22.266 --> 23:23.399
Lindsey: Richard Castle?

23:23.433 --> 23:24.167
Yes.

23:24.201 --> 23:25.935
Lindsey Trent. Nice to meet you.

23:25.970 --> 23:28.103
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

23:28.138 --> 23:29.772
Well, divorce is
stressful enough.

23:29.806 --> 23:31.439
Finding a lawyer shouldn't be.

23:31.474 --> 23:33.375
Now, let's go back to my office,

23:33.409 --> 23:35.410
and we'll see
how I can help you.

23:35.444 --> 23:37.312
How was your drive? Did you hit
<i>much traffic on the way in?</i>

23:37.346 --> 23:38.313
Uh, no, surprisingly...

23:38.347 --> 23:39.882
Ryan: He's going in.

23:39.916 --> 23:43.152
Figures Castle would own a pair
of live-streaming glasses.

23:43.186 --> 23:45.052
Actually,
Beckett gave them to him.

23:45.087 --> 23:46.287
- Really?
- What about Beckett?

23:47.489 --> 23:48.990
And what are you guys doing
in here?

23:49.024 --> 23:51.058
Hey, Beckett!
How's that warrant coming?

23:51.093 --> 23:53.494
You know, unfortunately, the D.A. said

23:53.528 --> 23:56.530
that we don't have
enough proof to, um...

23:57.666 --> 23:58.833
What are you watching?

23:58.867 --> 23:59.934
Hmm?

23:59.968 --> 24:00.968
Oh.

24:01.003 --> 24:02.002
Just...

24:02.036 --> 24:03.103
It's porn.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.104
Mm.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.105
You don't want it.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.572
[Snaps fingers]

24:06.607 --> 24:08.041
[Sighs]

24:10.874 --> 24:12.935
- Have you been here long?
- <i>These are our new offices...</i>

24:13.034 --> 24:14.238
Is that the lawyer?

24:14.337 --> 24:17.650
Uh, that is the live stream
from Castle's glasses.

24:17.685 --> 24:19.118
<i>I should talk to your decorator.</i>

24:19.152 --> 24:22.280
So, you guys sent Castle
on a surveillance mission

24:22.313 --> 24:25.825
after I told you he was not
to work any more NYPD cases.

24:25.859 --> 24:27.326
We didn't think you should know.

24:27.360 --> 24:28.382
We were trying to protect you.

24:28.383 --> 24:31.396
By sending my husband to
the city's top divorce attorney?

24:32.009 --> 24:33.966
Happy anniversary?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.201
Do you guys have any idea
how risky this is?

24:36.235 --> 24:37.836
This could blow the entire case.

24:37.870 --> 24:41.693
Our involvement in and knowledge
of this operation is over.

24:42.041 --> 24:44.642
So, tell me... what happened
<i>with you and, uh...</i>

24:44.676 --> 24:45.844
<i>Kate Beckett, right?</i>

24:45.878 --> 24:47.212
<i>The NYPD detective?</i>

24:47.246 --> 24:49.447
Castle: Oh, uh, <i>she's a captain, actually.</i>

24:49.481 --> 24:51.716
<i>Oh. She moved
up the ladder quickly.</i>

24:51.750 --> 24:54.051
Yes. Well, she's very good
at what she does.

24:54.085 --> 24:57.888
And that is the root
of your problem, isn't it?

24:57.922 --> 24:59.990
She's so focused on work,

25:00.024 --> 25:02.192
she doesn't have
anything left for <i>you?</i>

25:03.357 --> 25:05.695
Don't look so surprised.

25:05.730 --> 25:07.130
It's a story I've heard

25:07.165 --> 25:08.665
all too often.

25:11.001 --> 25:14.703
But like the stories you write,
Mr. Castle,

25:14.738 --> 25:17.706
you get to choose how this ends.

25:17.741 --> 25:20.977
<i>So, tell me...
are you set on divorce?</i>

25:21.011 --> 25:23.012
Or is there still hope?

25:27.917 --> 25:29.851
Well, um...

25:29.886 --> 25:33.194
That's a rather unusual question
for a divorce attorney to ask.

25:33.326 --> 25:35.390
Well, it's not like I need the business.

25:35.424 --> 25:36.925
Right. Yes.
I'm sure you're, uh...

25:39.095 --> 25:40.528
sure you're very busy.

25:40.563 --> 25:41.329
[Clears throat]

25:41.363 --> 25:43.198
Could I...
Could I get some water?

25:43.232 --> 25:44.198
<i>Of course.</i>

25:44.232 --> 25:45.299
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:49.604 --> 25:50.470
Here you go.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.539
Thank you.
[Chuckling] A little dry.

25:53.842 --> 25:54.374
Ohh!

25:54.409 --> 25:55.743
I am so sorry.

25:55.777 --> 25:56.877
That's okay.

25:56.912 --> 25:58.879
Uh, Tiffany,
can I get some towels?

25:58.914 --> 25:59.880
[Sighs]

25:59.915 --> 26:01.581
Tiff?

26:01.615 --> 26:02.749
Idiot.

26:02.783 --> 26:04.483
Um, I'm going to go
to the restroom

26:04.518 --> 26:05.852
[cellphone ringing] And
just get some paper towels.

26:05.886 --> 26:07.320
- Of course.
- Okay.

26:07.354 --> 26:08.321
This is Lindsey.

26:08.355 --> 26:09.355
Uh-huh.

26:10.124 --> 26:11.791
Really?

26:14.095 --> 26:16.529
Thanks for the heads-up.

26:16.563 --> 26:17.597
[Cellphone beeps]

26:17.631 --> 26:20.398
That was a friend of mine
from the D.A.'s office.

26:20.433 --> 26:21.867
And it, uh, it turns out

26:21.901 --> 26:24.203
someone is trying to get
a warrant for my client log.

26:24.237 --> 26:26.338
And... oh, yeah...
It's your wife.

26:26.372 --> 26:29.041
[Chuckling] Really?

26:29.075 --> 26:31.643
That is a crazy coincidence.

26:34.313 --> 26:36.680
[Chuckling] Ser... seriously,
this is just a misunderstanding.

26:36.715 --> 26:39.917
Okay, I'm not an idiot,
but obviously, <i>you</i> must be.

26:39.952 --> 26:42.086
There was no way
you could fool me.

26:42.121 --> 26:43.755
Quite a grip you have.

26:43.789 --> 26:45.089
Strong fingers.

26:52.296 --> 26:54.097
[Camera clicking]

27:12.200 --> 27:13.034
Esposito: George Keller.

27:13.068 --> 27:14.857
Alexis:
According to Lindsey's log book,

27:14.874 --> 27:17.171
he is the last person billed
for Scott's services.

27:17.205 --> 27:19.006
Is he connected to Keller Toys?

27:19.041 --> 27:22.308
He's the president
of the entire Keller empire...

27:22.342 --> 27:25.511
Toys, video games,
books, educational videos...

27:25.546 --> 27:26.379
You name it.

27:26.413 --> 27:28.447
It's a multi-billion-dollar company.

27:28.482 --> 27:30.616
And a brand
synonymous with family values,

27:30.651 --> 27:32.952
which is ironic
since he's a renowned playboy,

27:32.987 --> 27:34.487
already on wife number three.

27:34.521 --> 27:36.056
You say that like it's a bad thing.

27:36.090 --> 27:38.124
Oh, and here's a fun fact...
Keller's last divorce

27:38.159 --> 27:40.358
featured a prenup
that was nullified by...

27:40.393 --> 27:42.695
You guessed it...
His wife's infidelity.

27:42.729 --> 27:45.497
So George Keller has
used Scott's services before.

27:45.531 --> 27:48.133
And if Scott was seducing
the current Mrs. Keller

27:48.168 --> 27:50.002
when he had
his big change of heart...

27:50.036 --> 27:52.137
He might have turned on George
and threatened to expose him.

27:52.172 --> 27:54.406
Which would have damaged the
company's wholesome reputation,

27:54.440 --> 27:56.874
so Keller killed Scott
to keep him quiet.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.744
Scott McCoy?

27:59.778 --> 28:02.080
Sorry. I have no idea who that is.

28:02.114 --> 28:04.582
Well, that's funny,
because your second wife did.

28:04.616 --> 28:05.583
She recognized him

28:05.617 --> 28:07.551
immediately after
I showed her this picture.

28:07.586 --> 28:09.153
Guess it's hard
to forget somebody

28:09.188 --> 28:11.155
who cost you millions
in a broken prenup.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.823
It's not my fault she slept around.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.490
You <i>paid</i> the guy that she slept with,

28:14.525 --> 28:16.226
then you hired him again
to help you dump

28:16.260 --> 28:18.729
your current trophy wife
at a discounted price.

28:18.763 --> 28:20.197
You don't know
what you're talking about.

28:20.231 --> 28:21.531
[Door opens] I think I do.

28:21.565 --> 28:22.432
Not another word, George.

28:22.466 --> 28:24.234
You need to release my client
right now.

28:24.268 --> 28:25.168
I don't think so.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.170
Any evidence
that you think that you have

28:27.205 --> 28:28.338
has been obtained illegally,

28:28.372 --> 28:30.940
making anything that Mr. Keller
has said inadmissible.

28:30.974 --> 28:32.407
What's going on here?

28:32.442 --> 28:34.110
Oh, well, you tell <i>me,</i> Captain.

28:34.144 --> 28:36.779
First, you send your husband
to steal my records,

28:36.813 --> 28:38.580
and now your detective
is questioning my client

28:38.615 --> 28:39.681
without cause.

28:39.716 --> 28:42.885
Your client hired our victim
to sleep with his wife.

28:42.919 --> 28:45.554
In fact, our victim slept
with <i>four</i> of your clients' wives

28:45.588 --> 28:47.722
in order to blow up their prenups.

28:47.757 --> 28:49.590
That's a fact that I'm sure
would be interesting

28:49.625 --> 28:51.092
to the New York bar association.

28:52.561 --> 28:56.297
Okay. Let's not
get sidetracked here.

28:56.331 --> 28:58.699
The simple fact is,
you're investigating a murder,

28:58.734 --> 29:01.302
which my client
has nothing to do with.

29:01.336 --> 29:02.904
So we should
just take your word for it.

29:02.938 --> 29:03.804
Of course not.

29:03.838 --> 29:05.939
I will provide
my client's whereabouts

29:05.974 --> 29:07.741
the night that Mr. McCoy was killed.

29:07.776 --> 29:10.410
And you guys need
to get your facts straight.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.312
I'm not looking
to divorce my wife.

29:12.346 --> 29:14.281
We're renewing our vows
next weekend.

29:14.315 --> 29:16.250
You know we're gonna
look into that, right?

29:16.284 --> 29:17.317
Oh, please do.

29:17.351 --> 29:18.318
In fact...

29:18.352 --> 29:19.253
George.

29:19.287 --> 29:21.553
I'll even send you
the insurance papers

29:21.588 --> 29:24.556
for the $2 million ring
I'm giving her.

29:29.296 --> 29:30.830
Esposito:
Keller's telling the truth.

29:30.864 --> 29:33.132
He and his third wife
are renewing their vows

29:33.167 --> 29:33.933
next weekend in the Caribbean.

29:33.967 --> 29:35.601
And that $2 million rock is legit.

29:35.635 --> 29:36.602
I was just about to say that.

29:36.636 --> 29:37.703
Oh, really? I thought
you were about to tell her

29:37.737 --> 29:39.938
how you're still struggling
to verify Keller's alibi.

29:39.972 --> 29:41.239
- Oh, I'm struggling?
- Yeah, you're struggling.

29:41.274 --> 29:43.108
[Sighs] You guys, come on.

29:45.377 --> 29:46.144
Guys!

29:47.479 --> 29:50.282
All right. Tell me about Keller's alibi.

29:51.818 --> 29:53.251
I'm still trying to confirm

29:53.286 --> 29:55.252
that he was at his office
when Scott was murdered.

29:55.287 --> 29:57.321
Okay, well,
until we can verify that,

29:57.355 --> 29:58.655
then he is still a suspect,

29:58.690 --> 30:00.590
and my gut says
he's hiding something,

30:00.625 --> 30:01.926
so find it.

30:01.960 --> 30:04.161
And your gut is never wrong.

30:04.196 --> 30:06.096
You know, I know some people
in Keller's circle.

30:06.131 --> 30:07.331
I could put my feelers out.

30:07.365 --> 30:08.299
Uh... Yeah. Thanks, Castle.

30:08.333 --> 30:09.333
My pleasure.

30:09.367 --> 30:11.835
How are things between the boys?

30:11.869 --> 30:14.437
Not good, actually.
I'm kind of worried about them.

30:14.471 --> 30:15.371
Oh, they'll work it out.

30:15.405 --> 30:17.373
They've been through
way too much together

30:17.407 --> 30:19.642
to give up on what they have.

30:19.676 --> 30:23.679
You're a wise man, Castle...
With a big heart.

30:23.714 --> 30:25.114
You're rather good-looking, too.

30:25.149 --> 30:26.883
You might want to pace yourself
on the flattery.

30:26.917 --> 30:28.184
You've got a whole dinner
to get through.

30:28.219 --> 30:29.284
[Elevator bell dings]

30:29.319 --> 30:30.618
Ryan: Come on, Javi.
Just say it.

30:30.653 --> 30:32.888
Esposito: Trust me, you don't
want to hear what I really think.

30:32.922 --> 30:33.922
- Oh, bring it on.
- All right.

30:33.957 --> 30:36.391
You're a whiny, insecure,
jealous little baby

30:36.425 --> 30:38.227
who shot me in the ass on purpose!

30:38.261 --> 30:40.829
And you are an arrogant,
manscaped neanderthal.

30:40.864 --> 30:41.830
And it wasn't on purpose.

30:41.865 --> 30:42.898
Next time, it's gonna be.

30:42.932 --> 30:44.366
That's it. I want a new partner!

30:44.400 --> 30:45.834
Me too!

30:46.935 --> 30:49.003
Oh, we can't leave them
like this, can we?

30:49.037 --> 30:50.338
[Sighs] I'll talk to Javi.

30:50.372 --> 30:52.173
I'll see
if I can calm Ryan down.

30:52.207 --> 30:53.207
Rain check on dinner?

30:53.242 --> 30:54.408
Yeah.

30:54.442 --> 30:55.642
Yeah.

30:58.247 --> 31:00.748
How'd it all go so wrong?

31:00.782 --> 31:04.317
I mean, one day, we're a team...

31:04.352 --> 31:07.854
Simpatico, finishing
each other's sentences.

31:07.889 --> 31:08.855
And then...

31:08.890 --> 31:10.257
You shot him in the ass.

31:10.291 --> 31:12.025
It was an accident, Jav.

31:12.059 --> 31:13.726
Oh, was it? You sure about that?

31:13.761 --> 31:15.661
Yeah. And deep down
in your heart, <i>you</i> are, too.

31:15.696 --> 31:16.796
It doesn't matter.

31:16.830 --> 31:19.699
Once the trust is gone,
it's really hard to get it back.

31:19.733 --> 31:22.268
No, that's not true. A strong
relationship can survive anything.

31:22.302 --> 31:26.405
No relationship
can survive secrets or lies.

31:26.439 --> 31:28.540
Now, you need to tell Esposito
the truth...

31:28.574 --> 31:30.509
That you were hurt and jealous

31:30.543 --> 31:32.278
that he passed the test
and you didn't.

31:32.312 --> 31:35.047
Forget that. He... he rubbed it
in my face, remember?

31:35.081 --> 31:36.415
"Sergeant Esposito."

31:36.449 --> 31:37.715
You need to apologize.

31:37.749 --> 31:40.385
Hell no.
I am not apologizing to <i>him.</i>

31:40.419 --> 31:42.453
- Why not?
- Even before he shot me,

31:42.487 --> 31:44.889
he couldn't believe
that I passed and he didn't.

31:44.924 --> 31:46.457
You have to let it go.

31:46.491 --> 31:47.625
You have to let it go.

31:47.659 --> 31:49.360
I can't.

31:49.395 --> 31:51.396
I can't.

32:02.098 --> 32:03.799
[Cellphone ringing]

32:03.834 --> 32:05.602
Oh! It's my friend
who knows George Keller.

32:05.641 --> 32:07.026
Hey, Francis.

32:07.237 --> 32:08.385
Uh-huh.

32:08.971 --> 32:10.575
Uh-huh.

32:11.072 --> 32:12.406
Uh-huh!

32:13.242 --> 32:15.710
No, that's good.
That's all I need. Thank you.

32:15.744 --> 32:16.910
- Bye.
- What?

32:16.945 --> 32:18.912
Turns out George is involved

32:18.947 --> 32:21.282
in a power struggle
over the Keller empire

32:21.316 --> 32:24.051
with present C.E.O.
Penelope Keller.

32:24.085 --> 32:25.386
His mother, right?

32:25.420 --> 32:27.087
She founded the company.

32:27.122 --> 32:27.954
Yes, she did.

32:27.988 --> 32:29.556
Now, she has an advantage
over George.

32:29.590 --> 32:31.558
Because Keller
is a family brand,

32:31.592 --> 32:34.026
she has an impeccable reputation.

32:34.061 --> 32:35.262
Wait. You don't think...

32:35.296 --> 32:36.263
Oh, yes, I do.

32:36.297 --> 32:39.699
George hired Scott
to honeypot his own mother.

32:39.734 --> 32:43.270
I hadn't been with anyone since
my husband passed last year.

32:44.513 --> 32:47.105
It was time, and it was...

32:47.140 --> 32:48.741
Lovely.

32:48.775 --> 32:51.610
So you had no idea
that your son hired Scott

32:51.645 --> 32:53.211
to smear your reputation?

32:53.246 --> 32:54.212
None.

32:54.247 --> 32:55.781
[Chuckles]

32:55.815 --> 32:57.383
I wish I could tell you
I was more surprised

32:57.417 --> 32:58.517
when you told me,

32:58.551 --> 33:02.153
but family values have never
been George's strong suit...

33:02.187 --> 33:04.955
Which is actually
what our feud is about.

33:04.990 --> 33:06.957
What do you mean by that?

33:06.992 --> 33:10.161
George wants to shut down
all the manufacturing operations

33:10.195 --> 33:12.397
in this country
and send them overseas.

33:12.431 --> 33:13.398
To save money.

33:13.432 --> 33:15.433
But thousands of workers
would lose their jobs.

33:15.467 --> 33:17.702
I consider those people my family.

33:18.673 --> 33:20.804
Did you ever mention
any of this to Scott?

33:20.838 --> 33:21.571
Yes.

33:21.606 --> 33:23.273
Among other things he did well,

33:23.308 --> 33:25.175
Scott was a wonderful listener.

33:25.209 --> 33:26.376
Why?

33:26.411 --> 33:29.613
Well, it seems like he had a
crisis of confidence that night.

33:29.647 --> 33:32.115
Something happened that made him
want to change his ways.

33:32.149 --> 33:33.583
Oh, dear.

33:33.618 --> 33:35.918
You know,
there <i>was</i> something odd...

33:35.952 --> 33:38.987
The next day, I couldn't find
my card key to the office.

33:39.022 --> 33:41.156
I just assumed I'd misplaced it.

33:41.191 --> 33:43.024
Is it possible Scott took it?

33:45.729 --> 33:48.364
So, according to
Keller's security chief,

33:48.398 --> 33:50.132
Penelope's card key was used
to enter the building

33:50.166 --> 33:51.200
at 11:30 P.M.

33:51.234 --> 33:54.001
So Scott did go there
the night that he was killed,

33:54.036 --> 33:56.838
and I am betting you
it was to meet with George.

33:56.872 --> 33:59.173
But instead of bringing
x-rated photos of mom,

33:59.208 --> 34:03.445
Scott threatened to expose
George's illegal smear campaign.

34:03.479 --> 34:06.047
So Keller followed Scott home
and then silenced him.

34:06.081 --> 34:06.815
It's a solid theory.

34:06.849 --> 34:08.717
Only, it doesn't match the facts.

34:08.751 --> 34:11.385
In order to verify Keller's alibi,

34:11.418 --> 34:14.187
Vikram and I scrubbed security
footage from his office.

34:14.222 --> 34:15.856
It shows Scott arriving at 11:30,

34:15.889 --> 34:18.058
but then Scott left
10 minutes later.

34:18.092 --> 34:19.726
George Keller stayed
until 3:00 A.M.

34:19.761 --> 34:21.795
3:00 A.M... that's an hour
after Scott was killed.

34:21.830 --> 34:23.063
Keller's alibi holds.

34:23.097 --> 34:24.063
Beckett:
Yeah, but you know, guys,

34:24.098 --> 34:26.166
just because
Keller didn't follow Scott home

34:26.199 --> 34:27.567
doesn't mean
he's not involved somehow.

34:27.601 --> 34:29.201
Well, if he enlisted someone
to kill Scott,

34:29.235 --> 34:31.237
it would have to have been
after Scott showed up

34:31.271 --> 34:32.137
and threatened him.

34:32.172 --> 34:34.172
You know, Espo,
you did manage to get

34:34.206 --> 34:36.175
security-cam footage
from Keller's office.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.627
You think you could get
some phone records, too?

34:38.719 --> 34:40.547
Washington: Lindsey Trent?
Are you sure?

34:40.581 --> 34:43.014
Yes, sir, seems like she was
Mr. Keller's go-to person

34:43.050 --> 34:44.882
for all manner
of criminal activities.

34:44.917 --> 34:46.851
If Lindsey was operating
an entrapment scam

34:46.886 --> 34:47.851
for any of her clients,

34:47.887 --> 34:49.721
it was without the firm's
knowledge or approval.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.190
Well, then I'm sure
you'll be happy to help us out.

34:51.224 --> 34:52.056
Absolutely.

34:52.091 --> 34:53.158
Ryan, why don't you go
with this guy

34:53.193 --> 34:55.368
and grab copies of Lindsey's
files and phone records?

34:55.420 --> 34:58.063
Yeah, sure, sarge. Want me to get you a
cup of coffee, too, while I'm at it?

34:58.097 --> 34:59.665
Oooooh.

34:59.699 --> 35:01.999
I am so glad this is almost over.

35:02.033 --> 35:04.068
Put this damn pad away.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.703
All right?

35:05.737 --> 35:08.105
It doesn't matter anymore.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.009
Yeah.

35:12.043 --> 35:14.011
So, which one of you
gets the house?

35:14.045 --> 35:15.379
[Knock on door]

35:16.715 --> 35:17.547
You again.

35:17.582 --> 35:19.982
Here to harass me some more, detective?

35:20.017 --> 35:21.218
Actually,
I'm here to take you in.

35:21.252 --> 35:25.388
If this is your latest attempt
to get access to my client log,

35:25.423 --> 35:27.023
it won't work.

35:27.057 --> 35:28.692
You don't get it, do you?

35:28.726 --> 35:31.695
You're under arrest
for the murder of Scott McCoy.

35:31.729 --> 35:32.696
What?

35:32.730 --> 35:33.896
Mm.

35:33.931 --> 35:35.163
Why would I possibly do that?

35:35.198 --> 35:37.600
'Cause Scott was about to blow
the whistle on George Keller,

35:37.634 --> 35:39.835
and if your client's going down
for criminal conspiracy,

35:39.869 --> 35:41.837
well, <i>you</i> would, too.

35:41.871 --> 35:43.739
Okay, this is crazy.

35:43.773 --> 35:45.507
You have nothing on me.

35:45.542 --> 35:47.008
Yeah, well, you can
tell that to the judge

35:47.043 --> 35:48.444
who signed the search warrant
for your apartment.

35:48.478 --> 35:50.846
CSU's going through it
right now.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.681
Now, if you're innocent,
that won't be a problem.

35:53.716 --> 35:55.116
But if you stab a guy
nine times,

35:55.150 --> 35:57.285
you're bound to get
some blood on you somewhere.

35:57.319 --> 36:00.421
You probably threw the clothes
out, but what about the shoes?

36:00.456 --> 36:01.589
Did you get rid of them?

36:01.624 --> 36:02.490
[Chuckles]

36:02.524 --> 36:05.092
Or did you just try
to wipe them off?

36:05.127 --> 36:09.062
Because blood residue can be
one stubborn son of a bitch.

36:09.096 --> 36:11.030
Now, like I said,
I'm taking you in...

36:13.601 --> 36:15.435
- Lindsey, calm down.
- [Gun cocks] Shut up.

36:15.470 --> 36:17.937
- Just calm down.
- Shut up and let me think!

36:17.972 --> 36:19.539
Listen to me.

36:20.575 --> 36:21.908
You're a brilliant lawyer.

36:23.911 --> 36:25.078
You might still beat this.

36:25.112 --> 36:27.647
But if you pull that trigger,
you're gonna go away forever.

36:27.681 --> 36:30.182
Stay back.
Just stay away from me.

36:32.085 --> 36:33.118
I can't do that.

36:33.687 --> 36:34.720
Javi!

36:37.291 --> 36:39.425
[Breathing heavily]

36:40.594 --> 36:42.227
Kevin!

36:43.162 --> 36:44.929
Kevin!

36:53.792 --> 36:55.143
[Gasps]

36:56.457 --> 36:58.123
[Strained] I'm okay.

36:59.955 --> 37:01.894
Your notepad stopped the bullet.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.379
[Chuckles] How about that?

37:03.410 --> 37:05.264
Isn't that why you put it there?

37:05.298 --> 37:07.099
You saved my life.

37:07.133 --> 37:09.235
Just help me up before
the psycho bitch gets away.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.745
All right. Come on.

37:10.794 --> 37:12.605
Ryan: Stop! NYPD!

37:21.245 --> 37:22.795
Ryan: Don't move.
I'll shoot your ass.

37:22.861 --> 37:25.650
He'll do it, too. Trust me.

37:28.369 --> 37:29.886
Beckett: I'm still surprised

37:29.952 --> 37:32.075
that you jumped in front
of a bullet for this guy.

37:32.124 --> 37:33.692
Esposito: Me too.
I mean, normally,

37:33.724 --> 37:36.160
his slow-as-molasses ass
is never that fast,

37:36.195 --> 37:38.663
but he was just like...
Like "phoom!"

37:38.697 --> 37:39.697
[Laughs]

37:39.731 --> 37:42.132
All right, what...
What about, uh, George Keller?

37:42.167 --> 37:43.947
We picked him up at the airport.

37:43.999 --> 37:47.337
Lindsey confessed that, uh,
they were in on it together.

37:47.371 --> 37:49.439
And he was trying to leave
the country in a private jet,

37:49.473 --> 37:50.674
so there you go.

37:50.708 --> 37:53.243
Well, looks like he's gonna have
to postpone renewing his vows

37:53.277 --> 37:55.111
for another... what, 30 to life?

37:55.145 --> 37:56.979
- Right. [Chuckles]
- Oh, yeah.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.476
Anyway, guys,
I have to get going.

37:59.529 --> 38:00.848
Oh.

38:00.914 --> 38:03.724
Um... Unless you still
want me to put in

38:03.750 --> 38:05.621
those new-partner requests.

38:05.655 --> 38:07.292
Uh...

38:07.345 --> 38:09.191
Nah, not tonight.

38:09.226 --> 38:11.026
I'm gonna need somebody
eventually

38:11.060 --> 38:12.517
when this guy
gets bumped up to sergeant.

38:12.569 --> 38:14.588
Well, that's not gonna happen
anytime soon.

38:14.614 --> 38:17.533
I'm number 279 on a list of 300,

38:17.567 --> 38:19.801
so we're gonna be stuck together
for a while.

38:19.836 --> 38:22.169
I like the sound of that.

38:23.005 --> 38:24.643
If that's cool with you.

38:24.974 --> 38:26.607
Yeah.

38:26.642 --> 38:27.775
If it's cool with <i>you.</i>

38:27.810 --> 38:29.444
Is it cool with me?

38:31.347 --> 38:33.215
Bro, you took a bullet for me.

38:34.683 --> 38:36.751
You've got a wife...
A pregnant wife at home,

38:36.785 --> 38:38.618
you got a little girl
who depends on you,

38:38.653 --> 38:40.888
and yet, you still...

38:42.357 --> 38:43.958
Come here.

38:45.827 --> 38:47.928
I'm just gonna give you guys
a moment. Sorry.

38:51.199 --> 38:53.567
Want to come over,
watch some UFC?

38:53.601 --> 38:54.801
Jenny made tofu.

38:54.836 --> 38:57.436
I like the sound of that...
The UFC part.

39:01.808 --> 39:02.575
Hey.

39:03.086 --> 39:03.943
Hey.

39:03.970 --> 39:07.480
Um, happy anniversary?
A day late?

39:07.514 --> 39:10.816
Yeah. Or, um, 364 days early.

39:12.785 --> 39:13.952
I brought dinner for us.

39:13.987 --> 39:15.520
Remy's. Perfect.

39:15.554 --> 39:16.855
[Door closes]

39:16.890 --> 39:18.257
Um, Rick, I just wanted...

39:22.996 --> 39:24.329
Mm.

39:24.364 --> 39:25.163
Mm. Wait.

39:25.198 --> 39:26.831
Look, this doesn't mean
that we're...

39:26.866 --> 39:27.900
No. No, I know.

39:27.934 --> 39:31.168
No, this is just a...
Time-out from the time-out.

39:31.203 --> 39:32.669
Yeah.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.005
Yeah.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.839
So...

39:35.874 --> 39:37.131
Time in?

39:38.243 --> 39:39.043
Yeah.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.210
Yeah.

40:01.698 --> 40:03.966
Castle: That was even better
than I remembered.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.536
Yeah, well, I had to leave
a few moves for year 2.

40:07.570 --> 40:08.804
[Both chuckle]

40:10.673 --> 40:11.640
Rick?

40:11.674 --> 40:13.575
Mm-hmm?

40:14.100 --> 40:16.178
When you were
in that divorce lawyer's office,

40:16.212 --> 40:18.680
I was watching.

40:18.714 --> 40:20.581
Why, Captain Beckett,
I had no idea.

40:20.615 --> 40:21.816
I feel so violated.

40:21.850 --> 40:22.750
[Laughs]

40:22.784 --> 40:25.219
Look, I know
you were just playing a role,

40:25.254 --> 40:26.435
but...

40:28.290 --> 40:30.758
When she asked you
if there was any hope for us

40:30.792 --> 40:33.995
and you didn't say anything,
it was...

40:36.031 --> 40:36.864
Kate.

40:40.584 --> 40:43.592
I have <i>never given up hope.</i>

40:44.072 --> 40:46.337
Not since the day we met.

40:46.693 --> 40:50.377
And that'll never change
until you tell me it should.

40:53.114 --> 40:55.387
Then don't change.

40:56.249 --> 40:57.350
Ever.

40:57.384 --> 40:58.217
Okay.

40:58.251 --> 40:59.918
Okay.

41:03.183 --> 41:04.344
Mm.

41:04.924 --> 41:06.481
I have to go.

41:06.719 --> 41:08.694
I guess the time-out's over.

41:08.728 --> 41:09.862
Yeah.

41:11.567 --> 41:13.564
I'll be right back.

41:28.113 --> 41:30.347
[Cellphone vibrates]

41:40.603 --> 41:43.914
_

41:49.600 --> 41:52.001
Hey, I think your phone buzzed.

41:52.186 --> 41:53.399
Oh.

42:00.642 --> 42:02.477
Everything all right?

42:03.136 --> 42:03.478
[Cellphone beeps]

42:03.513 --> 42:04.646
Yeah. Fine.

42:06.115 --> 42:07.582
Okay, I'll see you around.

42:07.616 --> 42:08.583
See you.

42:08.617 --> 42:09.617
Mmm.

42:13.523 --> 42:15.057
