THAT GUY SNORING.

00:06.223 --> 00:07.659

00:07.659 --> 00:08.660
10 FEET AWAY?

00:08.660 --> 00:10.140
NO, NOT A SOUND.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.924
I SWEAR, DANA AND I
SLEPT LIKE BABIES.

00:11.924 --> 00:14.623
YEAH? WELL, MY BRAIN
WAS RATTLING.

00:14.623 --> 00:17.060
BETWEEN THAT
AND THE ANT FARM
IN MY SLEEPING BAG,

00:17.060 --> 00:18.757
I NEED A WEEKEND

00:18.757 --> 00:21.021
TO RECOVER
FROM MY WEEKEND.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.893
OK.
THAT'S EVERYTHING.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.416
LITERALLY. HERE.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.723
HA HA! OH, NO,
THAT'S OK. I GOT IT.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.072

00:29.072 --> 00:30.508
UH, NO! NO, NO,

00:36.471 --> 00:38.647
BUT I'LL--I'LL SEE YOU

00:38.647 --> 00:40.388
WE SHOULD GET THERE EARLY

00:40.388 --> 00:42.303
THEN WE CAN, YOU KNOW,
HEAD OVER TO BERKELEY.

00:42.303 --> 00:43.608
OK. I'LL PICK YOU UP?

00:43.608 --> 00:45.828
OH. UM...

00:45.828 --> 00:48.004

00:48.004 --> 00:49.875
SO I'LL MEET YOU AT
THAT--AT THAT PLACE,

00:49.875 --> 00:51.486

SARAH?

00:58.406 --> 01:00.538
WOW. UH...

01:00.538 --> 01:02.062
I WANT AN EXPLANATION.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.846
OH. UM...SORRY
WE'RE BACK SO LATE.

01:03.846 --> 01:05.630
TRAFFIC ON THE
BRIDGE WAS BACKED UP
TO LIKE THE 5--

01:05.630 --> 01:06.892
BAILEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME. UH...

01:06.892 --> 01:08.111
HOW COULD YOU
LIE TO US?

01:08.111 --> 01:09.591
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'D LIE TO US.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.549
NO, WAIT, MRS. REEVES.
HONEST, IT WAS MY FAULT.

01:11.549 --> 01:12.681
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET OFF
THE FREEWAY BECAUSE--

01:12.681 --> 01:14.204
BAILEY, PLEASE.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.293
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DIDN'T LIE,

01:16.293 --> 01:17.729
WHAT, YOU JUST FORGOT
TO MENTION THAT BAILEY
WAS COMING WITH YOU?

01:17.729 --> 01:19.209

01:19.209 --> 01:20.906

01:28.740 --> 01:29.915

01:31.395 --> 01:33.049
BAILEY, YOU

02:44.120 --> 02:45.774
HEY,

02:45.774 --> 02:47.993
I'M IN...HIGH SCHOOL.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.212
HIGH SCHOOL.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.780
IT'S GONNA BE...
DIFFERENT.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.999
I'M GONNA SHAKE THINGS UP.
MAYBE...

02:53.999 --> 02:56.393
MAYBE EVEN TRY OUT
FOR CHEERLEADING.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.482
CHEERLEADING. YOU.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.876
OWEN, CUT IT OUT.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.921
SINCE WHEN DID
YOU GET INTERESTED
IN CHEERLEADING?

03:02.921 --> 03:05.010
SINCE I GOT INTERESTED
IN BEING POPULAR,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.012
YEAH, BUT...YOU?

03:07.012 --> 03:08.188
CHEERLEADING?

03:09.711 --> 03:10.973
OH...

03:10.973 --> 03:12.017
OH, YEAH.

03:12.017 --> 03:14.324
THIS IS DEFINITELY...

03:14.324 --> 03:15.325

03:15.325 --> 03:17.458
YEAH, WELL, WHATEVER.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.416
CAN WE PLEASE JUST GET
OUT OF HERE, BECAUSE
OWEN IS GOING NUTS.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.418
RIGHT AFTER
I STOP BY HOUSEWARES.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.638
WHAT, THE NEW YOU
NEEDS A BLENDER?

03:23.638 --> 03:27.250
NO. I WANT TO GET JULIA
AND GRIFFIN A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR THEIR PLACE.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.296
I WANT TO SURPRISE
JULIA WITH A...

03:29.296 --> 03:31.950
A LITTLE HOUSEWARMING
GIFT WHEN SHE GETS HOME
THIS AFTERNOON.

03:31.950 --> 03:35.258
YOU GUYS ARE COMING OVER,
RIGHT? I MEAN, WE SHOULD...

03:35.258 --> 03:38.043
WE SHOULD HAVE SOME
KIND OF...CELEBRATION
OR SOMETHING.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.871
I DON'T KNOW, CLAUD.
I MEAN, MAYBE WE
SHOULD JUST GIVE HER

03:39.871 --> 03:41.308
A LITTLE SPACE
AT FIRST, YOU KNOW?

03:41.308 --> 03:42.874
SHE'S BEEN AWAY
FOR 2 MONTHS,

03:42.874 --> 03:44.876
AND SHE PROBABLY
JUST WANTS TO BE
WITH GRIFFIN,

03:44.876 --> 03:47.836
SO HURRY UP
AND GET CHANGED,
ALL RIGHT?

03:47.836 --> 03:49.751
WHEN DID YOU GET SO OLD?

03:52.014 --> 03:53.276
OWEN...

03:54.712 --> 03:56.018
THAT'S...

03:56.018 --> 03:58.107
TAKE THAT OFF.

03:58.107 --> 04:00.892
NO, I JUST...
HOW COULD YOU DO
THAT, SARAH?

04:00.892 --> 04:02.633
HOW COULD YOU
LIE TO ME LIKE THAT
ALL SUMMER?

04:02.633 --> 04:04.244
WELL, LET'S SEE:
MY PARENTS SAID

04:04.244 --> 04:05.984
THEY DIDN'T WANT ME
SEEING YOU ANYMORE

04:05.984 --> 04:07.595
BECAUSE YOU'RE
IRRESPONSIBLE
AND DANGEROUS.

04:07.595 --> 04:08.857
I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
A NICE WAY TO PUT THAT.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.119
"DANGEROUS"?

04:10.119 --> 04:12.948
WHAT THE HELL IS
THAT, "DANGEROUS"?

04:12.948 --> 04:16.256
SO YOU JUST LIE TO THEM,
AND YOU LIE TO ME.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.648
WAIT A MINUTE.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.041
NO. WAIT A MINUTE,
BAILEY,

04:19.041 --> 04:20.738
WHO ARE YOU MAD AT HERE?

04:20.738 --> 04:23.219
I ONLY DID IT
SO I COULD SPEND
TIME WITH YOU.

04:23.219 --> 04:24.568
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I JUST--

04:24.568 --> 04:26.091
WHAT THE HELL DO
THEY WANT FROM ME?

04:26.091 --> 04:28.137
LOOK, THEY'RE ON A TEAR
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT,

04:28.137 --> 04:30.270
AND THEY THINK
YOU'RE THE REASON
I'M NOT GOING TO BROWN--

04:30.270 --> 04:33.142
AND--AND WHAT ELSE
ARE THEY GONNA BLAME
ON ME?

04:33.142 --> 04:35.536
I MEAN, I'M IN AA.
I'VE BEEN SOBER
FOR 5 MONTHS.

04:35.536 --> 04:38.016
YEAH, I KNOW,
I TRIED TO TELL THEM
THAT, BAILEY,

04:38.016 --> 04:40.454
BUT MY DAD, YOU KNOW,
HE'S A TYPICAL LAWYER.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.107
YOU CAN'T TELL HIM HE'S
WRONG ABOUT ANYTHING,

04:42.107 --> 04:44.501
AND MOM...OY.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.590
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

04:46.590 --> 04:49.158
HOW LONG AM I GONNA BE
THIS PERSONA AU GRATIN?

04:49.158 --> 04:50.507
NON GRATA.

04:50.507 --> 04:52.030
WHATEVER.

04:52.030 --> 04:54.772
DOES THIS MEAN THAT
WE CAN'T HANG OUT?

04:54.772 --> 04:55.991
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

04:55.991 --> 04:58.472
NO. GOD, NO.
OF COURSE NOT.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.865
WHAT IS
THEIR PROBLEM
ANYWAY?

05:00.865 --> 05:02.954
YOU FORGAVE ME,

05:02.954 --> 05:05.348
AND OF ALL PEOPLE,
IF YOU CAN FORGIVE
ME, WHY CAN'T THEY?

05:13.138 --> 05:15.184
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:15.184 --> 05:17.012
IS THIS TOO STUPID?

05:17.012 --> 05:19.841
IT'LL DO UNTIL THEY
DELIVER THE TABLE.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.973
NOW RELAX
AND HELP ME.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.192
YOU'RE MAKING ME
NERVOUS.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.020
WHAT IF
SHE HATES THIS PLACE?

05:25.020 --> 05:26.456
IT'S RENTED.

05:26.456 --> 05:27.936
WHAT IF SHE HATES
ALL THIS STUFF?

05:27.936 --> 05:29.590
IT'S RENTED.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.461
THESE PICTURES.
WHAT IF SHE HATES
THESE PICTURES?

05:31.461 --> 05:33.594
THEY'RE RENTED!
NOW, WHAT ARE YOU
SO WORRIED ABOUT?

05:35.422 --> 05:38.076
2 MONTHS IS
A LONG TIME, YOU KNOW.

05:38.076 --> 05:40.470
WELL, WHAT IF SHE WANTS
TO START SPEAKING FRENCH
TO ME OR SOMETHING?

05:40.470 --> 05:42.124
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHE KEPT TALKING
ABOUT SEEING

05:42.124 --> 05:43.734
SOME MAYONNAISE EXHIBIT.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.997
WHAT IF SHE WANTS
MY OPINION ON THAT?

05:45.997 --> 05:47.216
MAYONNAISE?

05:47.216 --> 05:49.653
YEAH. SOME
FRENCH ARTIST GUY.

05:49.653 --> 05:52.264
I THINK YOU MEAN MANET.

05:55.093 --> 05:57.095
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE? I MEAN...

05:57.095 --> 05:58.488
SHE LOVES YOU FOR YOU.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.447
YEAH,
BUT SHE'S BEEN AWAY

06:00.447 --> 06:03.058
SEEING ALL THESE
REALLY COOL PLACES
I CAN'T EVEN PRONOUNCE,

06:03.058 --> 06:05.016
AND I'VE BEEN CHANGING
LEAKY FUEL PUMPS
ALL SUMMER.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.975
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:06.975 --> 06:08.846
I LIKED THE WAY THINGS
WERE BEFORE SHE LEFT,
YOU KNOW,

06:08.846 --> 06:10.282
AND YOU KNOW
THAT WITH US,

06:10.282 --> 06:12.502
ABSENCE DEFINITELY MAKES
THE HEART GROW WEIRDER.

06:12.502 --> 06:14.199
DID YOU CALL
THE AIRLINE?

06:14.199 --> 06:16.680
YEAH, YEAH.
HER FLIGHT'S ON TIME.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.856
THEN STOP OBSESSING
AND GET YOUR BUTT
IN GEAR.

06:18.856 --> 06:21.032
RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:25.297 --> 06:26.298
JULIA!

06:26.298 --> 06:27.778
GRIFFIN!

06:29.693 --> 06:30.825
HEY...

06:30.825 --> 06:32.000
EXCUSE ME.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.567
HEY!
JULIA!

06:33.567 --> 06:35.177
EXCUSE ME.

06:35.177 --> 06:36.831
I'M--OH! SORRY.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.223
THAT'S MY WIFE.

06:38.223 --> 06:39.573
MY, UH...HUSBAND.

06:39.573 --> 06:40.965
WOW. IT'S MY WIFE.

06:42.358 --> 06:45.187
HEY!
HEY!

06:45.187 --> 06:47.145
OH, GOD, LOOK AT YOU.
OH, YOUR HAIR...

06:47.145 --> 06:48.451
YOU CUT YOUR HAIR.

06:48.451 --> 06:50.584
YEAH. IN--IN PARIS.
YOU HATE IT?

06:50.584 --> 06:53.630
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S--IT'S VERY...

06:53.630 --> 06:54.892
PARIS-LIKE.

06:54.892 --> 06:55.893
YEAH.

06:55.893 --> 06:56.981
YOU'RE BY YOURSELF?

06:56.981 --> 06:58.287
YEAH, IT'S JUST ME.

06:58.287 --> 06:59.636
IT'S PART OF MY...

06:59.636 --> 07:01.116
HUSBANDLY DUTIES,
I GUESS.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.692
AH, IT'S REALLY YOU.

07:11.692 --> 07:13.041
IT'S REALLY ME.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.390
YEAH...

07:14.390 --> 07:16.348
HEY, OWE.

07:16.348 --> 07:18.960
TURN OFF RUGRATS
AND COME EAT.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.614
Owen: IN A MINUTE.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.224
NO. NOT IN A MINUTE.

07:22.224 --> 07:23.965
NOW.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.836
I PUT MR. HONEY BEAR
ON YOUR SANDWICH.

07:25.836 --> 07:27.098
YOU LOVE
MR. HONEY BEAR.

07:29.231 --> 07:32.495
I'M GOING TO
COUNT TO 3.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.497
1...

07:34.497 --> 07:36.586
2...

07:36.586 --> 07:37.587
2 AND 1/2...

07:37.587 --> 07:39.110
Owen: OK, OK.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.640
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA...

07:46.640 --> 07:47.771
OWEN...

07:47.771 --> 07:50.121
WHY ARE YOU
WEARING THAT?

07:50.121 --> 07:52.341
BECAUSE
I'M PLAYING DRESS-UP.

07:52.341 --> 07:53.995
OK...

07:53.995 --> 07:55.344
BUT...

07:55.344 --> 07:57.041
WOULDN'T YOU
RATHER BE...

07:57.041 --> 07:58.434
A COWBOY

07:58.434 --> 07:59.827
OR A FOOTBALL
PLAYER

07:59.827 --> 08:01.045
OR...YOU KNOW,

08:01.045 --> 08:02.003
A MARINE?

08:02.003 --> 08:03.831
WHY?

08:03.831 --> 08:05.746
WELL...

08:05.746 --> 08:07.617
BECAUSE
YOU'RE A BOY,

08:07.617 --> 08:08.966
AND THOSE ARE
GIRL CLOTHES.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.359
HA HA.

08:10.359 --> 08:11.926
COME ON, LET'S GO
GET YOU CHANGED.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.449
WHY?

08:13.449 --> 08:14.972
WELL, BECAUSE YOU
JUST DON'T DO THAT.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.234
OK?

08:16.234 --> 08:17.975
NOW, COME ON.
I GOT AN IDEA.

08:17.975 --> 08:19.107
LET'S GO GET
YOUR SUPERMAN CAPE,

08:19.107 --> 08:20.151
AND WE'LL
GET YOU CHANGED.

08:20.151 --> 08:21.762
NO, NO, NO!

08:21.762 --> 08:23.024
I LIKE IT!

08:25.113 --> 08:26.506
OH, MAN.

08:30.074 --> 08:32.120
[GIGGLES]

08:32.120 --> 08:34.601
OK. NOW.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.776
WOW.

08:35.776 --> 08:38.039
YOU--YOU LIVE HERE?

08:38.039 --> 08:39.257
NO.

08:39.257 --> 08:40.650
WE LIVE HERE.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.043
HUH?

08:42.043 --> 08:43.740
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
THE BEDROOM.

08:43.740 --> 08:46.308
SO WAIT A SECOND,
YOU--YOU BOUGHT
ALL THIS STUFF?

08:46.308 --> 08:48.310
UH, IT'S RENTED,
ACTUALLY.

08:48.310 --> 08:49.746
OH.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.226
IT'S THE ITALIAN
RENAISSANCE COLLECTION.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.097
I GOT IT 'CAUSE
OF ALL THAT ART STUFF

08:53.097 --> 08:54.403
YOU WROTE ABOUT
IN YOUR POSTCARDS.

08:54.403 --> 08:55.752
IF YOU HATE IT,
WE CAN--

08:55.752 --> 08:58.538
NO! NO. IT'S JUST, UM...

08:58.538 --> 09:01.802
OH, YOU ARE SO ADORABLE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

09:06.328 --> 09:08.635
[WHISPERING] I feel like
I've been gone forever.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.332
YEAH.

09:10.332 --> 09:11.986
WELCOME HOME.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.991
SURPRISE!

09:16.991 --> 09:19.471
HEY! CLAUD!

09:19.471 --> 09:21.473
HOW'RE YOU DOING?

09:21.473 --> 09:23.519
LOOK AT YOU!
LOOKS FAMILIAR!

09:23.519 --> 09:25.303
YOUR HAIR LOOKS GREAT!
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

09:25.303 --> 09:27.218
YOU'RE STILL HERE?

09:27.218 --> 09:29.438
I TOLD YOU--
OH, I LET GRIFFIN
PICK YOU UP ALONE

09:29.438 --> 09:31.179
SO YOU GUYS COULD,
UH, GET SOME TIME
TOGETHER,

09:31.179 --> 09:32.876
BUT NOW
I'M DYING TO HEAR
ALL ABOUT YOUR TRIP!

09:32.876 --> 09:34.182
OH, WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

09:34.182 --> 09:35.400
I ALMOST FORGOT.

09:36.401 --> 09:37.489
TA-DA!

09:37.489 --> 09:38.708
HUH...

09:38.708 --> 09:40.057
IT'S
A HOUSEWARMING GIFT

09:40.057 --> 09:41.319
FOR THE WORLD
TRAVELER:

09:41.319 --> 09:43.321
YOUR VERY OWN
GELATO MAKER.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.932
AND YOU KNOW,
I FIGURED I COULD
WHIP SOME UP

09:44.932 --> 09:46.760
WHILE YOU TELL ME
ALL ABOUT YOUR TRIP.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.936
DO YOU HAVE
PICTURES?

09:48.936 --> 09:51.808
YEAH, CLAUD, BUT, UH...

09:51.808 --> 09:53.897
WHERE DID I PUT
THOSE STRAWBERRIES?

09:53.897 --> 09:55.377
YOU KNOW WHAT, CLAUD?

09:55.377 --> 09:57.901
I'M KIND OF...JET LAGGED,

09:57.901 --> 09:59.990
AND I--I HAVE A...
HEADACHE.

09:59.990 --> 10:03.167
OH, I CAN GET
SOME ASPIRIN
TO...

10:03.167 --> 10:05.779
OH. OH, YEAH,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:05.779 --> 10:08.390
ME, TOO.
UM, HEADACHE,
I MEAN.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.000
YEAH?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.872
MAJOR, MAJOR HEADACHE.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.395
YEAH.
IT'S PRACTICALLY
A MIGRAINE.

10:14.788 --> 10:18.226
OK, I'LL JUST, UH...

10:18.226 --> 10:19.619
RAIN CHECK.

10:20.794 --> 10:21.708
OK.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.416
MR. THORSEN,
I APPRECIATE IT.

10:34.416 --> 10:35.722
THANK YOU
FOR COMING BY.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.114
THANKS.
BYE-BYE.

10:37.114 --> 10:38.333
OK. BYE-BYE.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.770
UM, EXCUSE ME,
MR. REEVES.

10:40.770 --> 10:43.947
HI. UM, I'M SORRY
FOR JUST SHOWING UP
LIKE THIS,

10:43.947 --> 10:46.036
BUT...WE REALLY
HAVE TO TALK.

10:46.036 --> 10:48.125
THERE IS NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT, BAILEY.
NOW, PLEASE, WILL YOU--

10:48.125 --> 10:50.954
YES, THERE IS! GOD,
WILL YOU PLEASE--

10:50.954 --> 10:53.827
MAYBE IF YOU WOULD
JUST LISTEN TO ME
INSTEAD OF...

10:53.827 --> 10:56.090
WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST HEAR ME OUT?

10:56.090 --> 10:58.919
I'M SORRY. GIVE ME
A COUPLE OF MINUTES,
WILL YOU? THANKS.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.877
COME ON.

11:10.887 --> 11:11.932
I'M LISTENING.

11:11.932 --> 11:15.283
GOOD, BECAUSE...

11:15.283 --> 11:19.026
I KNOW WHAT YOU
AND MRS. REEVES
THINK ABOUT ME,

11:19.026 --> 11:20.592
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

11:20.592 --> 11:24.379
THE TRUTH IS, THAT'S
NOT REALLY FAIR,

11:24.379 --> 11:26.337
BECAUSE
I'VE CHANGED,

11:26.337 --> 11:27.817
SIR.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.906
I'M A DIFFERENT
PERSON NOW THAN...

11:29.906 --> 11:32.648
THAN WHEN
I WAS DRINKING.

11:32.648 --> 11:35.520
AND MAYBE I NEVER
APOLOGIZED TO YOU
FOR WHAT HAPPENED,

11:35.520 --> 11:37.044
SO I WANT
TO DO THAT NOW.

11:37.044 --> 11:40.090
I WAS COMPLETELY
OUT OF CONTROL,

11:40.090 --> 11:42.440
AND THERE'S
NO EXCUSE FOR THAT,

11:42.440 --> 11:45.182
BUT I'M TRYING
TO PUT THAT
BEHIND ME NOW,

11:45.182 --> 11:48.316
AND I'M SORRY.

11:48.316 --> 11:49.404
I AM SORRY.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.580
I DID...

11:51.580 --> 11:53.495
I DID SOME
STUPID THINGS,

11:53.495 --> 11:55.105
SOME REALLY
STUPID THINGS--

11:55.105 --> 11:57.412
CRIMINAL THINGS, BAILEY.
YOU KNOW THAT?

11:57.412 --> 12:01.503
AND DO YOU HONESTLY
BELIEVE THAT JUST BY
SAYING YOU'RE SORRY,

12:01.503 --> 12:03.723
IT MAKES IT OK
THAT YOU NEARLY
KILLED MY DAUGHTER?

12:03.723 --> 12:08.466
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH...

12:08.466 --> 12:11.426
I LIVE WITH THAT
EVERY SINGLE DAY,
SIR.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.384
EVERY TIME I SEE
HER, I REMEMBER.

12:13.384 --> 12:15.169
BUT IN SOME
WEIRD WAY,

12:15.169 --> 12:16.910
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT GIVES ME
THE STRENGTH.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.002
I HAVEN'T HAD
A DRINK IN 5 MONTHS.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.438
I AM IN AA,

12:23.438 --> 12:25.135
AND THAT'S WORKING,

12:25.135 --> 12:27.964
BUT SARAH IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO ME.

12:27.964 --> 12:29.966
SHE IS...

12:29.966 --> 12:31.925
SHE HAS HELPED ME
TO STAY SOBER

12:31.925 --> 12:34.231
BECAUSE SHE WANTS
TO HELP ME. ONLY
NOW, SHE TELLS ME

12:34.231 --> 12:35.755
THAT YOU'VE
FORBIDDEN HER
TO SEE ME,

12:35.755 --> 12:37.757
AND THAT'S...

12:37.757 --> 12:39.933
MR. REEVES,
I JUST...

12:39.933 --> 12:42.849
I REALLY NEED
FOR YOU TO GIVE ME
ANOTHER CHANCE HERE.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.292
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING, BAILEY.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.426
HOW OFTEN DO YOU GO
TO MEETINGS?

12:55.426 --> 12:57.428
I GO TO MEETINGS
3 TIMES A WEEK.

12:57.428 --> 12:58.995
SOMETIMES 4.

12:58.995 --> 13:01.563
AND THE WEEKS WHEN
YOU GO 4 TIMES...

13:01.563 --> 13:02.956
THOSE ARE HARD WEEKS,
RIGHT?

13:02.956 --> 13:04.348
YEAH. I GUESS YOU
COULD SAY THAT.

13:04.348 --> 13:07.003
WEEKS WHEN YOU REALLY
WANT TO DRINK.

13:07.003 --> 13:09.223
YEAH. YEAH. THAT'S
WHY I GO TO AA.

13:09.223 --> 13:13.314
SO IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU GO TO THESE MEETINGS
3, 4 TIMES A WEEK

13:13.314 --> 13:16.056
BECAUSE YOU REALLY
WANT TO DRINK,

13:16.056 --> 13:19.015
AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN CONTROL THE URGE,
IS THAT RIGHT?

13:19.015 --> 13:21.017
YEAH...YEAH,
I SUPPOSE SO.

13:21.017 --> 13:23.803
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT
HAPPENS IF YOU BREAK?

13:23.803 --> 13:26.631
YOU WANT TO TELL ME THAT?

13:26.631 --> 13:28.764
WHAT IF YOUR LIFE
DEPENDED ON IT?

13:28.764 --> 13:30.679
YOUR LIFE!

13:30.679 --> 13:35.205
CAN YOU SWEAR TO ME
YOU WILL NEVER, EVER
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK?

13:35.205 --> 13:37.077
IT'S SCARY, ISN'T IT,

13:37.077 --> 13:39.209
THE THOUGHT OF A LIFE
WITHOUT ALCOHOL?

13:39.209 --> 13:41.733
NO. NO, THAT'S--
THAT'S--NO!

13:41.733 --> 13:43.518
WHY ARE YOU
CROSS-EXAMINING ME
LIKE THIS?

13:43.518 --> 13:44.562
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST--

13:44.562 --> 13:46.042
OH, BAILEY, COME ON!

13:46.042 --> 13:48.175
HOW THE HELL
DO YOU EXPECT ME TO TRUST YOU

13:48.175 --> 13:50.133
WHEN YOU CLEARLY DON'T
EVEN TRUST YOURSELF?

13:50.133 --> 13:53.049
AND I AM NOT GOING TO
RISK SARAH BEING THERE

13:53.049 --> 13:54.311
WHEN YOU MAKE
ANOTHER MISTAKE.

13:54.311 --> 13:55.922
WELL, WHAT DO
YOU WANT FROM ME?

13:55.922 --> 13:57.184
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO GET PAST THIS.

13:57.184 --> 13:58.620
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

13:58.620 --> 14:00.665
STAY THE HELL
AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER!

14:05.670 --> 14:07.368
THAT'S...

14:07.368 --> 14:10.762
THAT'S THE ONE THING
THAT I WON'T DO, SIR.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.590
I'M SORRY, BUT I WON'T.

14:34.569 --> 14:35.483
GRIFFIN.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.225
HMM?

14:38.225 --> 14:40.749
GRIFFIN, YOU AWAKE?

14:40.749 --> 14:43.665
NO.

14:43.665 --> 14:46.668
THE BED KEEPS MAKING
THESE WEIRD NOISES.

14:46.668 --> 14:50.411
IT'S PLASTIC.
IT'S RENTED.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.065
OH.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.070
I'M SORRY. I GUESS
I'M JUST A LITTLE WIRED.

14:57.070 --> 15:00.377
IT'S LIKE BREAKFAST TIME
IN PARIS.

15:00.377 --> 15:02.553
MMM. FRENCH TOAST.

15:05.513 --> 15:08.385
SO WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO TOMORROW?

15:08.385 --> 15:11.171
I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF
OUR FIRST DAY TOGETHER
AGAIN, YOU KNOW?

15:15.218 --> 15:16.828
I SORT OF GOTTA WORK.

15:18.874 --> 15:19.788
OF COURSE.

15:21.877 --> 15:26.751
WELL, I GUESS MAYBE I'LL
JUST GET SETTLED IN...

15:26.751 --> 15:28.492
OR...SOMETHING.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.148
HEY, DID YOU UNPACK
ANY OF MY BOXES?

15:32.148 --> 15:34.977
NO, NO. I THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU'D WANT TO.

15:39.982 --> 15:43.159
IT'S KIND OF WEIRD MY FAMILY
DIDN'T CALL OR COME BY,

15:43.159 --> 15:46.728
EXCEPT CLAUD, OF COURSE.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.689
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST GO OVER THERE
IN THE MORNING.

15:51.689 --> 15:54.127
YEAH, MAYBE.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.867
GET SOME SLEEP, OK?

16:04.485 --> 16:06.139
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.618
SARAH, I WAS TRYING
TO REASON WITH HIM.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.316
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT, BAILEY,

16:09.316 --> 16:10.665
'CAUSE WHATEVER YOU SAID,

16:10.665 --> 16:12.014
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
LIKE THIS.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.189
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
THIS ANGRY.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.321
YEAH, WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:14.321 --> 16:16.323
I'M ANGRY, TOO.

16:16.323 --> 16:19.587
I WENT TO SEE HIM TO--
TO--I DON'T KNOW--

16:19.587 --> 16:22.285
TO EXPLAIN TO THE GUY
WHY HE'S BEING
SO UNFAIR TO ME

16:22.285 --> 16:23.591
AND TO US,

16:23.591 --> 16:25.506
AND THE NEXT THING
I KNOW,

16:25.506 --> 16:26.986
HE'S TREATING ME
LIKE I'M SOME SORT
OF CRIMINAL,

16:26.986 --> 16:28.074
SO WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

16:28.074 --> 16:30.641
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING,
BAILEY,

16:30.641 --> 16:33.296
'CAUSE NOW HE'S SAYING
HE'S NOT GONNA PAY
FOR MY HOUSING AT BERKELEY,

16:33.296 --> 16:36.038
AND I'M GONNA LIVE AT HOME
WHERE HE CAN KEEP
AN EYE ON ME.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.953
GOD, HE DID THAT?
HE ACTUALLY...

16:39.476 --> 16:41.348
[SIGHS]

16:44.003 --> 16:47.267
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.138
I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO HELP.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.661
YEAH, WELL, NICE TRY.

17:10.812 --> 17:12.205
OH, SORRY.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.513
HEY, I'M--
I'M CLAUDIA.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.385
THIS IS FOR
CHEERLEADING
TRYOUTS.

17:18.385 --> 17:20.778
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

17:20.778 --> 17:21.953
DUH.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.303
OH.

17:23.303 --> 17:24.304
BUT AREN'T YOU,
LIKE, KIND OF,

17:24.304 --> 17:26.262
YOU KNOW,
TOO SHORT?

17:26.262 --> 17:29.048
IT'S CHEERLEADING,
NOT A ROLLER COASTER.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.485
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN...

17:31.485 --> 17:33.530
HOW TALL ARE YOU?

17:33.530 --> 17:34.531
5'1".

17:36.925 --> 17:38.666
AND AN 1/8.

17:38.666 --> 17:41.060
WHICH IF YOU HAPPEN
TO THINK ABOUT IT,

17:41.060 --> 17:44.280
IT'S GOOD FOR THE TOP
OF THOSE PYRAMID THINGS

17:44.280 --> 17:47.109
OR ONE OF THOSE CHEERS
WHERE THEY PICK
SOMEBODY UP

17:47.109 --> 17:49.807
AND JUST THROW THEM.
I MEAN...I COULD DO THAT.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.070
LIKE, WHATEVER.

17:56.597 --> 17:57.946
JENNY!

17:57.946 --> 18:01.210
HEY, OWEN! OH, MY--
OH, MY GOODNESS!

18:01.210 --> 18:03.691
YOU'RE GETTING
STRONGER EVERY DAY,
AREN'T YOU?

18:03.691 --> 18:05.606
HEY, CHARLIE.
HOW ARE YOU?

18:05.606 --> 18:07.260
I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.652
OWEN, GO ON AND PLAY, OK?

18:08.652 --> 18:10.263
I WANT TO TALK
TO JENNY FOR A MINUTE.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.134
THAT'S OK, HONEY.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.876
AND GUESS WHAT.
WE'RE GONNA DO
STORY CIRCLE TODAY, OK?

18:14.876 --> 18:16.791
BYE. WHAT'S UP?

18:16.791 --> 18:18.923
I WANTED TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING, UH...

18:18.923 --> 18:19.924
ABOUT OWEN.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.361
UH-HUH.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.363
HE'S, UH...

18:23.363 --> 18:26.279
HE STARTED DOING
SOMETHING THAT'S,
WELL...

18:26.279 --> 18:28.063
IT'S KIND OF FREAKY,
AND...

18:28.063 --> 18:29.847
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
OR WHAT I SHOULD DO,

18:29.847 --> 18:31.327
SO I THOUGHT I'D ASK YOU.

18:31.327 --> 18:32.850
WHAT'S HE DOING?

18:32.850 --> 18:36.419
HE'S KIND OF INTO
PLAYING DRESS-UP.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.943
DRESS-UP IN, YOU KNOW,
LIKE, ACTUAL DRESSES.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.554
HA HA HA.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.338
I'M SORRY, CHARLIE.

18:42.338 --> 18:45.124
I DON'T THINK YOU
HAVE ANYTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.431
LOTS OF LITTLE BOYS
GO THROUGH THESE PHASES

18:48.431 --> 18:50.868
WHERE THEY LIKE
TO EXPERIMENT

18:50.868 --> 18:54.002
WITH, IT'S CALLED

SOMETHING HE KIND OF NEEDS.

28:42.459 --> 28:45.071
THE CAB DRIVER.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.856
THE CAB DRIVER, THE ONE
THAT I ALMOST HIT?

28:47.856 --> 28:50.293
WELL, HOW COULD HE
PROVE THAT I WAS DRUNK?

28:50.293 --> 28:52.513
WELL, HE ISN'T.
HE'S JUST GOING TO TESTIFY
TO WHAT HE SAW, THAT'S ALL.

28:52.513 --> 28:55.734
AND WHAT ABOUT THIS NURSE,
THE ONE WHO ADMITTED SARAH
TO THE HOSPITAL?

28:55.734 --> 29:00.260
ALL SHE CAN DO IS SAY THAT
BAILEY SMELLED OF ALCOHOL
AND WAS SLURRING HIS WORDS.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.522
AND SARAH.
WHAT ABOUT SARAH?

29:01.522 --> 29:02.828
WILL THEY
MAKE HER TESTIFY?

29:02.828 --> 29:04.786
IF THE D.A. CALLS HER,
YES, BUT--

29:04.786 --> 29:06.570
OH, MAN. I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS.

29:06.570 --> 29:09.704
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
JUST LET ME FINISH
HERE, PLEASE.

29:09.704 --> 29:11.837
JUST CALM DOWN.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.535
I THINK WE CAN
PREVENT THIS FROM
EVER GOING TO TRIAL.

29:14.535 --> 29:15.971
YOU DO?

29:15.971 --> 29:17.843
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS ARGUE TO THE D.A.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.670
THAT YOU'RE
A FIRST-TIME
OFFENDER

29:19.670 --> 29:21.237
AND YOU'RE IN AA,

29:21.237 --> 29:23.370
AND THEY'LL PROBABLY
DROP THE WHOLE THING

29:23.370 --> 29:25.285
OR PLEAD IT DOWN
TO A MISDEMEANOR.

29:25.285 --> 29:27.243
BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT WAS GONNA BE
AN AUTOMATIC FELONY

29:27.243 --> 29:28.767
BECAUSE HE WAS ONLY 19
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.943
WELL, LOOK...

29:30.943 --> 29:33.684
THEY'RE PROCEEDING OUT
OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION
AT THIS POINT.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.251
THEY DON'T REALLY
WANT TO PURSUE THIS

29:35.251 --> 29:37.166
ANY MORE
THAN WE WANT THEM TO.

29:37.166 --> 29:39.299
SO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'LL HAPPEN?

29:39.299 --> 29:41.475
NOW THAT
I HAVE ALL THE FACTS,
YES, I DO.

29:41.475 --> 29:44.304
MY FIRSTBORN,
MAN, I SWEAR.

29:44.304 --> 29:45.914
WEAR A TIE TOMORROW,
ALL RIGHT?

29:45.914 --> 29:46.915
OK.

29:46.915 --> 29:47.916
THANKS, EMMET.

29:47.916 --> 29:48.787
NIGHT, ALL.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.446
THAT'S GOOD NEWS, HUH?

29:56.446 --> 30:00.059
YEAH, IF IT'S TRUE.

30:00.059 --> 30:04.454
JUST WAKE ME WHEN IT'S
ALL OVER, ALL RIGHT?

30:04.454 --> 30:07.893
I HOPE
EMMET'S RIGHT.

30:07.893 --> 30:08.981
NO KIDDING.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.087
SO YOU PAINTED
IN HERE.

30:28.087 --> 30:29.915
OH, YEAH.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.612
IT WAS STARTING
TO PEEL.

30:31.612 --> 30:32.961
BAY HELPED ME OUT.

30:35.529 --> 30:36.617
LOOKS GOOD.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.276
YOU KNOW, CHARLIE,
I CUT MY HAIR,

30:43.276 --> 30:44.843
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
SAY ANYTHING.

30:46.975 --> 30:47.846
OH, YEAH.

30:49.891 --> 30:50.849
IT LOOKS NICE.

30:54.722 --> 30:57.464
YOU WANT SOME HELP
WITH THE DISHES?

30:57.464 --> 30:59.727
IT'S 4 COFFEE CUPS.
I CAN MANAGE.

31:01.511 --> 31:04.645
AND GRIFFIN'S PROBABLY
WAITING FOR YOU, SO...

31:04.645 --> 31:06.429
YEAH, I KNOW,
I KNOW.

31:06.429 --> 31:08.954
IT'S JUST THAT
ALL THIS STUFF
WITH BAILEY,

31:08.954 --> 31:11.739
I FEEL LIKE
I SHOULD BE DOING
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

31:11.739 --> 31:13.523
WHAT?

31:13.523 --> 31:15.003
HE'S GONE TO BED,
AND THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON,

31:15.003 --> 31:16.048
SO...IT'S OK.

31:19.747 --> 31:21.792
YOU KNOW, CHARLIE,
JUST BECAUSE
I'M MARRIED,

31:21.792 --> 31:25.144
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M NOT A PART OF
THIS FAMILY ANYMORE.

31:25.144 --> 31:27.015
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE
REASONABLE HERE.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.016
YOU'VE BEEN AWAY
FOR 2 MONTHS--

31:28.016 --> 31:30.062
YEAH--2 MONTHS,

31:30.062 --> 31:32.238
AND YOU GUYS DIDN'T
EVEN COME MEET ME
AT THE AIRPORT.

31:32.238 --> 31:33.935
WHAT?

31:33.935 --> 31:35.850
WE DIDN'T WANT TO HORN IN
ON YOU AND GRIFFIN.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.504
LOOK...

31:37.504 --> 31:39.723
JUL, THERE'S
NOTHING TO DO HERE, ALL RIGHT,

31:39.723 --> 31:42.988
SO YOU SHOULD
JUST GO HOME.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.873
HEY... IT'S LATE.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.962
YEAH, I KNOW.
I CAME AS SOON
AS I FOUND OUT.

32:00.962 --> 32:03.182
I WOULD HAVE
CALLED YOU,

32:03.182 --> 32:05.880
BUT I NEVER KNOW WHO'S
GONNA ANSWER THE PHONE
AT YOUR PLACE, SO...

32:05.880 --> 32:08.143
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT
I'M SORRY.

32:08.143 --> 32:10.929
I MEAN, THIS IS
BEYOND CRUEL AND
UNFAIR AND HORRIBLE,

32:10.929 --> 32:12.931
AND I
NEVER THOUGHT--

32:12.931 --> 32:15.063
YOU KNOW WHAT?
EMMET DOESN'T THINK
IT'S SO BAD.

32:15.063 --> 32:20.025
HE SAYS THAT WE CAN
PROBABLY PLEAD IT DOWN
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

32:20.025 --> 32:21.678
SO MAYBE
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

32:21.678 --> 32:24.029
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT, BAILEY.

32:24.029 --> 32:27.162
REALLY. HE--HE THINKS THAT
THEY'RE JUST DOING IT
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO.

32:27.162 --> 32:30.296
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.994
I OVERHEARD
MY FATHER TALKING
TO A FRIEND OF HIS

32:32.994 --> 32:34.778
AT THE D.A.'s
OFFICE.

32:34.778 --> 32:37.607
THAT'S WHY
THEY PULLED
THE POLICE REPORT.

32:37.607 --> 32:40.088
THIS DIDN'T JUST
HAPPEN, BAILEY.

32:40.088 --> 32:40.959
WHAT?

32:42.612 --> 32:45.050
MY FATHER DID THIS.

32:45.050 --> 32:47.008
HE'S THE ONE
PUSHING THIS THING.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.879
IT'S ALL HIS FAULT.

32:50.185 --> 32:52.013
WAIT A MINUTE.

32:52.013 --> 32:55.886
HE--HE DID THIS?
HE STARTED THIS
WHOLE THING?

32:55.886 --> 33:00.065
OH, MY GOD.
WH-WHY WOULD HE...

33:00.065 --> 33:01.240
DOES HE HATE ME
SO MUCH--

33:01.240 --> 33:02.806
BAILEY--

33:02.806 --> 33:04.243
WHAT THE HELL DOES HE
WANT FROM ME, SARAH?

33:04.243 --> 33:07.463
DOES HE ACTUALLY
WANT ME TO GO TO JAIL?

33:07.463 --> 33:09.900
YOU--YOU GOTTA
DO SOMETHING.

33:09.900 --> 33:11.424
YOU GOTTA DO SOMETHING.
YOU GOTTA TALK TO HIM

33:11.424 --> 33:12.729
AND MAKE HIM STOP THIS.

33:12.729 --> 33:14.731
I TRIED.
I TRIED, BAILEY,

33:14.731 --> 33:16.559
BUT HE WON'T.
IT'S LIKE
HE'S OBSESSED--

33:16.559 --> 33:18.083
NO, ARE YOU
EVEN LISTENING
TO ME, SARAH?

33:18.083 --> 33:19.127
I COULD GO TO JAIL!

33:19.127 --> 33:20.346
I KNOW.

33:20.346 --> 33:22.130
WELL, THEN,
DO SOMETHING!

33:22.130 --> 33:25.742
TELL HIM--
TELL HIM HE WINS.

33:25.742 --> 33:27.396
YOU TELL THAT CRAZY
SON OF A BITCH

33:27.396 --> 33:28.919
THAT I'LL GO AWAY.

33:28.919 --> 33:30.878
YOU TELL HIM WE'LL
STOP SEEING EACH OTHER.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.488
I ALREADY DID.

33:35.535 --> 33:37.841
I TOLD HIM
I WOULD DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

33:37.841 --> 33:40.931
AS LONG AS
HE LEAVES YOU ALONE,

33:40.931 --> 33:43.021
BUT HE DIDN'T
BELIEVE ME.

33:45.632 --> 33:48.026
IT'S TOO LATE,
BAILEY.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.244
IT'S TOO LATE.

33:49.244 --> 33:50.463
AND NOW
THAT IT'S STARTED,

33:50.463 --> 33:52.726
THERE'S NOTHING
ANYBODY CAN DO.

34:13.834 --> 34:15.662
HEY, YOU.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.707
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU
COME HOME.

34:17.707 --> 34:19.057
OH.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.841
I DIDN'T
WANT TO WAKE YOU.

34:23.670 --> 34:24.888
ALWAYS WAKE ME.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.980
I WANT YOU TO.

34:29.980 --> 34:32.113
OK. THAT'S
GOOD TO KNOW.

34:35.638 --> 34:37.423
I GUESS WE'RE
JUST KIND OF
FIGURING THIS OUT

34:37.423 --> 34:39.729
AS WE GO ALONG, HUH?

34:39.729 --> 34:41.079
FIGURING WHAT OUT?

34:41.079 --> 34:42.819
BEING MARRIED.

34:42.819 --> 34:45.605
DO I WAKE YOU UP?
DO YOU WAKE ME UP?

34:45.605 --> 34:48.999
BUT I GUESS THAT'S
WHAT MARRIAGE IS...

34:48.999 --> 34:51.741
JUST FIGURING THINGS
OUT AS YOU GO ALONG.

34:55.005 --> 34:57.269
WHAT ELSE ARE
YOU FIGURING OUT?

34:58.748 --> 35:00.924
EVERYTHING.

35:00.924 --> 35:03.013
I DON'T KNOW,
GRIFFIN.

35:03.013 --> 35:05.451
IT'S JUST, WHERE
DO I PUT MY STUFF?

35:05.451 --> 35:09.716
AND DO I LIKE
ITALIAN RENAISSANCE
FURNITURE?

35:09.716 --> 35:12.153
AND DO I WANT TO BE
MRS. GRIFFIN HOLBROOK?

35:13.807 --> 35:16.288
OH...GOD.

35:16.288 --> 35:17.898
NO, NO, NO.
I JUST MEANT, UM,

35:17.898 --> 35:19.595
DO I WANT TO
CHANGE MY NAME?

35:22.598 --> 35:25.732
BUT IT'S NOT
JUST THAT.

35:25.732 --> 35:28.126
IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING
IS SO WEIRD.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.650
MY FAMILY DOESN'T
NEED ME ANYMORE,

35:30.650 --> 35:33.218
AND I HAVE
THIS HUSBAND

35:33.218 --> 35:34.871
AND THIS STRANGE
APARTMENT,

35:34.871 --> 35:37.526
AND I FEEL LIKE
I'M PLAYING HOUSE.

35:38.745 --> 35:41.051
MAYBE...

35:41.051 --> 35:45.055
MAYBE I NEED TO
EASE INTO THIS
A LITTLE MORE...

35:45.055 --> 35:47.667
SO I CAN FIGURE OUT
WHERE I BELONG.

35:50.887 --> 35:53.020
AND MAYBE WE CAN
DO SOME OF THIS
STUFF TOGETHER.

35:53.020 --> 35:55.457
I MEAN,
MAYBE WE CAN...

35:55.457 --> 35:58.286
MAKE A HOME
TOGETHER.

35:58.286 --> 36:01.246
HEY, WHY DO YOU THINK
I RENTED EVERYTHING?

36:01.246 --> 36:03.378
HUH?

36:03.378 --> 36:08.078
WE CAN EVEN MOVE
IF YOU WANT.
I DON'T CARE.

36:08.078 --> 36:11.647
I DON'T KNOW.
VIEW'S KIND OF NICE
FROM UP HERE.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.391
NO. ALL
I'M ASKING IS,

36:16.391 --> 36:19.002
WHAT GOOD'S
IT GOING TO DO
TO PROSECUTE HIM?

36:19.002 --> 36:21.004
I MEAN, IT'S A WASTE
OF EVERYBODY'S TIME,

36:21.004 --> 36:22.789
AND OBVIOUSLY YOU
PICK AND CHOOSE
WHAT CASES--

36:22.789 --> 36:24.399
NO. THE DISTRICT
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

36:24.399 --> 36:26.358
GOES AFTER CASES
WHICH HAVE SOLID
EVIDENCE,

36:26.358 --> 36:27.576
WHICH THIS ONE HAS.

36:27.576 --> 36:29.012
NOW, PLEASE,
MR. SALINGER,

36:29.012 --> 36:31.145
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

36:31.145 --> 36:32.973
I MEAN, I'M, REALLY
SURPRISED THAT YOUR
LAWYER ADVISED THIS.

36:32.973 --> 36:34.453
HE DOESN'T KNOW I'M--

36:34.453 --> 36:36.933
LOOK, I WANTED YOU
TO HEAR IT FROM ME, OK?

36:36.933 --> 36:39.327
MY BROTHER
IS 20 YEARS OLD,

36:39.327 --> 36:40.937
AND, YES,
HE MADE A MISTAKE,

36:40.937 --> 36:42.112
BUT HE'S PULLED
HIMSELF TOGETHER

36:42.112 --> 36:44.114
SINCE--SINCE
THE ACCIDENT.

36:44.114 --> 36:46.552
AND IF SOMEBODY
CAN JUST CALL UP HERE
AND PULL SOME STRINGS

36:46.552 --> 36:47.988
BECAUSE THEY WANT
TO GET MY BROTHER--

36:47.988 --> 36:49.468
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

36:49.468 --> 36:50.860
THIS CASE
LANDED ON MY DESK.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.340
IT'S A GOOD CASE.
THAT'S IT.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.907
YOU'RE GOING TO RUIN
HIS WHOLE LIFE...

36:53.907 --> 36:55.430
AND MAYBE YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE

36:55.430 --> 36:57.258
SOME KIND OF EXAMPLE
OUT OF HIM,

36:57.258 --> 36:59.739
BUT HE'S--
HE'S SOBER NOW.
HE'S IN AA.

36:59.739 --> 37:01.567
THERE'S NO WAY
HE DESERVES THIS.
NO WAY.

37:01.567 --> 37:03.612
I SEE. I SEE. I SEE.
SO YOU THINK

37:03.612 --> 37:05.571
THAT WE SHOULD JUST
IGNORE THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

37:05.571 --> 37:07.486
BECAUSE BASICALLY
YOUR BROTHER'S
JUST A GOOD GUY?

37:07.486 --> 37:08.965
LOOK,
ALL I'M SAYING--

37:08.965 --> 37:10.489
THAT'S NOT HOW
THE SYSTEM WORKS.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.447
NOW, I PROSECUTE
CRIMINALS.

37:12.447 --> 37:13.753
THAT'S MY JOB.
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TRYING TO DO.

37:13.753 --> 37:15.102
YOU WANT TO ARGUE
CHARACTER,

37:15.102 --> 37:16.234
ARGUE IT WITH THE
JUDGE, ALL RIGHT?

37:16.234 --> 37:17.191
NOW, PLEASE,
MR. SALINGER,

37:17.191 --> 37:18.105
JUST GO.

37:19.628 --> 37:20.673
SO THAT'S IT?

37:23.241 --> 37:26.940
WHAT YOUR BROTHER DID,
MR. SALINGER,
IS A VERY SERIOUS CRIME.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.942
NOW, APPARENTLY YOU
DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE

37:28.942 --> 37:31.858
THAT DRUNK DRIVING
CAN HAVE VERY REAL
CONSEQUENCES.

37:39.909 --> 37:41.998
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

37:41.998 --> 37:44.697
WHAT THE HELL
DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

37:45.915 --> 37:49.179
OH, SORRY.

37:49.179 --> 37:50.833
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TALKING TO ME.

37:50.833 --> 37:51.921
I WAS.

37:51.921 --> 37:52.922
WHAT IS THAT?

37:52.922 --> 37:55.577
OH, THIS.

37:55.577 --> 37:58.014
YOU KNOW,
THE SCHOOL MASCOT.

37:58.014 --> 38:00.452
YOU KNOW,
THE MIGHTY,
FIGHTING POSSUM.

38:00.452 --> 38:02.062
YOU'RE THE POSSUM?

38:02.062 --> 38:03.193
OH, YEAH, BUT NOT--

38:03.193 --> 38:05.370
COOL.EXCUSE ME?

38:05.370 --> 38:07.197
SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO DO IT.

38:07.197 --> 38:08.677
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU WANT TO SWITCH
LOCKERS WITH ME?

38:08.677 --> 38:10.679
IT'LL BE EASIER
FOR YOU TO REACH,

38:10.679 --> 38:12.377
AND I HATE SQUATTING
LIKE THIS ANYWAY.

38:12.377 --> 38:13.639
SO...

38:13.639 --> 38:16.598
THAT'D BE...GREAT.
THANKS.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.523
IT KIND OF SMELLS.

38:28.523 --> 38:31.309
TRY STICKING YOUR
HEAD UP IN THERE
SOMETIME.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.614
HA HA.

38:32.614 --> 38:34.573
HERE. HERE'S
MY COMBINATION.

38:34.573 --> 38:36.662
OH, UH...

38:36.662 --> 38:37.924
WHAT'S YOURS?

38:37.924 --> 38:39.447
UM, LET ME, UH...

38:39.447 --> 38:40.448
PAPER...

38:40.448 --> 38:41.319
RIGHT HERE.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.324
YOU WANT ME TO...

38:46.324 --> 38:47.847
YEAH. THAT WAY
I WON'T LOSE IT,
YOU KNOW?

39:00.555 --> 39:01.426
COOL.

39:02.557 --> 39:03.558
SEE YA.

39:03.558 --> 39:04.690
YEAH.

39:08.911 --> 39:11.261
I HOPE SO.

39:11.261 --> 39:13.612
ANYWAY, IT'S PRETTY
CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

39:13.612 --> 39:15.309
A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON,

39:15.309 --> 39:17.442
GROWN-UP STUFF THAT WE
GOT TO DO FOR BAILEY.

39:17.442 --> 39:20.445
BUT ROSS SAID THAT
HE GOT 101 DALMATIANS

39:20.445 --> 39:21.576
FOR YOU AND TESS
TO WATCH TONIGHT,

39:21.576 --> 39:23.622
SO...IT'LL BE FUN.

39:23.622 --> 39:24.623
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

39:24.623 --> 39:25.493
OK.

39:28.627 --> 39:30.237
LOOK, OWE...

39:30.237 --> 39:33.849
I KIND OF NEED
TO HAVE A TALK
WITH YOU,

39:33.849 --> 39:35.373
YOU KNOW,
MAN-TO-MAN.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.245
I'M A LITTLE SLOW
ON THE UPTAKE SOMETIMES,

39:38.245 --> 39:40.247
BUT I THINK I FINALLY
FIGURED OUT WHAT IT IS

39:40.247 --> 39:42.467
YOU'VE BEEN
TRYING TO TELL ME
ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED.

39:42.467 --> 39:45.034
AND THE THING IS,
IN A WAY

39:45.034 --> 39:46.601
I KIND OF NEED
THE SAME THING
THAT YOU DO.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.821
I MEAN,
YOU NEED SOMEBODY,

39:48.821 --> 39:50.692
AND--AND
I NEED SOMEBODY.

39:50.692 --> 39:52.520
AND I KNOW
MY TRACK RECORD

39:52.520 --> 39:53.869
ISN'T THE GREATEST
WHERE THAT'S
CONCERNED,

39:53.869 --> 39:56.437
BUT I JUST
WANT YOU TO KNOW

39:56.437 --> 39:59.005
THAT I'M
GONNA FIND HER...

39:59.005 --> 40:01.007
FOR BOTH OF US.

40:01.007 --> 40:02.400
I PROMISE.

40:05.533 --> 40:07.492
AS FAST
AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

40:14.237 --> 40:16.849
YOU LOOK NICE.

40:16.849 --> 40:19.721
LAST TIME I WORE THIS
WAS TO A FUNERAL.

40:21.854 --> 40:23.856
YOU GOT A LETTER.

40:23.856 --> 40:25.858
IT'S FROM STATE.

40:25.858 --> 40:27.294
GREAT.

40:27.294 --> 40:29.644
JUST WHAT I NEED--
MORE GOOD NEWS.

40:33.779 --> 40:34.867
WHAT?

40:35.998 --> 40:37.391
WHAT IS IT?

40:37.391 --> 40:39.393
WOW.

40:39.393 --> 40:41.787
I WON THE LOTTERY.

40:41.787 --> 40:43.963
THE LOTTERY?

40:43.963 --> 40:45.225
ARE YOU KIDDING?

40:45.225 --> 40:46.792
NO. NOT--
NOT THAT LOTTERY.

40:46.792 --> 40:49.490
THIS TV CLASS
THAT I REALLY NEEDED...

40:49.490 --> 40:52.188
THIS MEANS I'LL HAVE A SHOT
AT GETTING SOME DECENT
GRADES THIS SEMESTER,

40:52.188 --> 40:53.494
SO BY SPRING--

40:58.978 --> 41:00.588
WHO AM I KIDDING?

41:05.288 --> 41:07.769
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP,
BAILEY.

41:14.646 --> 41:17.562
WE'RE, UM, WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO MEET EMMET

41:17.562 --> 41:19.041

41:48.288 --> 41:49.507
CLAUD, COME ON.

41:57.689 --> 41:59.908
I'M SORRY.

42:01.780 --> 42:02.737
NOT YOUR FAULT.

42:04.173 --> 42:05.653
