WEBVTT

00:52.052 --> 00:54.489
Goal! Goal! Goal!

01:00.190 --> 01:06.196
Goal! Goal! Goal!

02:38.854 --> 02:40.943
- Shock and awe...

02:44.076 --> 02:45.861
- Karagounis.
A go for the Greeks

02:46.253 --> 02:47.515
and scoring!

02:47.863 --> 02:50.126
- One of the biggest shocks
in football history.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.265
- They've done it!
They won!

02:59.614 --> 03:01.311
Greece has won!

03:01.355 --> 03:03.313
- Beyond all expectations.

03:03.357 --> 03:07.099
- One of the greatest
underdog tales for all time.

03:07.361 --> 03:10.102
- A new chapter
in Greek mythology.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.064
- When you initially--

04:06.811 --> 04:09.814
- Okay. Um...
Should we do this in English?

04:12.295 --> 04:13.427
- Should we try it in English?

04:19.911 --> 04:22.479
- Lets start at the beginning.
Where were you born?

07:36.717 --> 07:39.241
- He's an absolute hero
in this part of the world.

07:39.415 --> 07:42.113
By far the longest serving
coach in the Bundesliga.

07:46.683 --> 07:49.947
- He's had great success with
Verde Bremen and Kaiserschlacht.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.837
- King Otto goes back
onto his thrown.

11:05.012 --> 11:06.883
- Can you tell-- What is the
name of this team?

11:06.927 --> 11:08.624
I don't know...
I mean, is there a...

11:08.668 --> 11:10.017
What's the name of this team?

11:10.060 --> 11:11.975
- Well, it's called
the Hellenic Football Feder--

11:12.019 --> 11:13.498
It's the Greek soccer team.

11:13.542 --> 11:14.978
It's the National Team
of Greece.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.285
The National...
the National Soccer Team.

14:20.468 --> 14:23.036
- On behalf of your friends
at Olympic Airlines,

14:23.079 --> 14:24.646
welcome to Greece.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.697
Thank you.

15:40.678 --> 15:41.897
- Okay.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.341
- Thank you.

18:47.517 --> 18:48.997
- Beautifully done.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.438
They hardly won here.

18:56.439 --> 18:57.832
There is one here.

18:58.180 --> 19:01.705
- The Greek defending here
is pretty well nonexistent.

24:57.626 --> 25:00.150
- England play Greece
tomorrow at Old Trafford,

25:00.194 --> 25:02.631
in a game which should see them
qualify for next summer's

25:02.675 --> 25:03.850
World Cup finals.

25:05.373 --> 25:06.592
- England!

25:07.027 --> 25:08.898
- A dress rehearsal
in Manchester today

25:08.942 --> 25:11.901
for the victory parade
now expected of England.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.686
For the likes for David Beckham

25:13.729 --> 25:16.732
this must be akin to messing
around in his own back garden.

25:17.167 --> 25:20.257
No hint of pre-match nerves here
against Greece.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.956
It's turning into a predictable
one for the bookies though.

25:22.999 --> 25:25.785
The payout for an England
victory is hardly generous.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.789
It can't be too boring then
for the German coach

25:29.832 --> 25:31.355
of the Greek national side.

25:31.399 --> 25:33.662
He conducts training
through an interpreter

25:33.706 --> 25:35.925
and his team
is said to be in disarray.

26:25.714 --> 26:28.543
- Maybe we'll be in for an
anxious opening, I don't know.

26:29.631 --> 26:30.980
Free striker right to left.

26:31.024 --> 26:33.287
Gary Nevill leaves
first touch to Beckham.

26:37.334 --> 26:38.597
This is Beckham.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.734
Oh, it took all Nikopolidis'
range to get across his goal

26:45.778 --> 26:46.953
and clear it.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.487
And well done to pull back.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.489
- Great play by Konstantinos.

27:03.578 --> 27:04.927
- Oh, Greece has scored!

27:06.581 --> 27:09.410
A scoring drive.
Nigel Martin was in trouble.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.934
Looms large for England
at Old Trafford.

27:12.065 --> 27:13.762
- I can't believe
what we're seeing here.

27:14.981 --> 27:16.635
And England...

27:16.809 --> 27:18.680
He came here for an equalizer.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.301
They're going to need
a goal scoring hero.

27:31.345 --> 27:32.651
Can they find one now.

27:33.303 --> 27:35.262
- It's still one - nil.
Beckham to take the free kick.

27:35.305 --> 27:36.872
Teddy Sheringham is on.

27:37.830 --> 27:39.135
- Beckham takes.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.572
- And they've done it!

27:43.270 --> 27:45.838
Beckham to Sheringham
and Sheringham scores!

27:47.535 --> 27:49.972
A sensational substitution.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.498
- Can he get the ball away?

27:54.629 --> 27:56.544
Oh, and Greece scores a goal!

27:57.197 --> 27:58.589
Nikolaidis,

27:58.851 --> 28:00.809
has made it 2 - 1 to Greece.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.159
- The whole crowd is stunned.

28:03.856 --> 28:06.380
What a game
this is turning out to be.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.082
- Now Beckham.

28:14.388 --> 28:16.825
Just outside the area,
Beckham goes down.

28:18.305 --> 28:20.350
The 93rd minute
at Old Trafford.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.309
Beckham to chase.

28:23.658 --> 28:25.747
Beckham! Yes!

28:26.792 --> 28:30.709
He's done it!
David Beckham!

28:30.752 --> 28:32.188
It's 2 - 2!

28:34.451 --> 28:36.279
- Greece gave up the lot here.

28:37.150 --> 28:38.717
They led twice

28:39.195 --> 28:41.415
and it looks as though it was
going to give them the win,

28:41.458 --> 28:44.331
and England
at the desperation of defeat.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.105
- Goal!

30:46.540 --> 30:48.281
Goal!

35:06.539 --> 35:08.497
Goal! Goal! Goal!

35:18.681 --> 35:20.640
Goal! Goal! Goal!

35:35.916 --> 35:38.179
Goal! Goal! Goal!

36:21.048 --> 36:24.399
- We start with roll Peter,
can you shuffle the two balls?

36:24.443 --> 36:26.096
And take the first one.

36:27.228 --> 36:28.664
- Portugal...

36:29.709 --> 36:30.797
- Greece.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.147
- Spain

36:35.062 --> 36:36.629
and Russia.

36:38.283 --> 36:41.416
- In group A, we have Portugal,
Greece, Spain, Russia.

36:46.073 --> 36:51.687
I think we can look forward
to a very exciting Euro 2004.

36:51.861 --> 36:55.778
I wish all the teams
the best of luck.

36:55.822 --> 36:56.997
Thank you very much.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.869
- From two different
sporting galaxies,

39:09.912 --> 39:13.960
the Portuguese hosts
and the improbable challengers.

39:14.003 --> 39:17.746
The favorites and the chancers.
It may not be pretty.

39:18.834 --> 39:21.228
Greece's new German coach
Otto Rehhagel.

39:21.271 --> 39:24.927
The start of a new era
in Greek international football.

40:12.671 --> 40:15.325
- Now the anthem of the
host nation Portugal.

40:20.722 --> 40:23.464
Opening night in the Dragao
in Porto.

40:23.595 --> 40:26.032
There is only one sport
in Portugal.

40:26.075 --> 40:28.164
This is a football nation.

40:28.208 --> 40:30.428
This is their idea of heaven.

41:50.682 --> 41:53.859
- Karagounis go for the Greeks,
shooting and scoring!

42:00.474 --> 42:03.259
Greeks have crashed
the Portuguese party.

42:03.869 --> 42:06.524
And straight away
they've upset the furniture.

42:07.046 --> 42:09.091
Georgios Karagounis

42:09.657 --> 42:12.573
with the opening goal
of Euro 2004.

42:25.238 --> 42:26.979
- The ball stolen
by Seitaridis.

42:27.022 --> 42:28.676
This is Charisteas.

42:30.504 --> 42:31.897
And Seitaridis didn't stop.

42:31.940 --> 42:33.942
Seitaridis has
gone on to penalty.

42:41.167 --> 42:43.038
Two - nil! Immaculate!

42:44.997 --> 42:47.303
Beyond all expectation.

42:47.913 --> 42:49.610
Otto Rehhagel's Greece.

42:49.654 --> 42:54.049
The rank outside is handing over
the European Championship hosts.

42:54.093 --> 42:57.096
It is Portugal 1, Greece 2.

42:58.924 --> 43:03.493
For Greece, it is the first
tournament win in their history.

43:13.329 --> 43:16.332
- This has been the greatest win
for a Greek team.

43:16.376 --> 43:20.293
Is it also for you the greatest
team win in your career?

43:24.993 --> 43:26.429
- One of the greatest.

44:30.189 --> 44:33.583
- If Greece win today, they will
be the first side through

44:33.932 --> 44:35.324
to the quarter finals.

44:40.068 --> 44:41.374
Raúl nips in again.

44:41.417 --> 44:43.463
Morientes shoots for Spain.

44:43.506 --> 44:44.812
Goal for Spain.

44:48.076 --> 44:51.514
And it's the old plan
in action again.

44:52.037 --> 44:54.692
Spain on their way
into the quarter finals

44:54.735 --> 44:55.736
or so they hope.

44:55.780 --> 44:56.868
Tsiartas.

44:57.825 --> 44:59.000
Helguera missed it.

44:59.044 --> 45:00.306
And it's Dellas!

45:00.349 --> 45:01.568
One - one!

45:03.701 --> 45:05.311
Spain have been marked.

45:06.051 --> 45:08.096
Greece has made
a real impression

45:08.357 --> 45:09.794
on this tournament.

45:11.926 --> 45:14.886
The expectation was
that after two matches

45:14.929 --> 45:17.279
Greece would have no points,

45:17.323 --> 45:18.759
they've got four.

45:18.977 --> 45:21.022
And they're in with
a very strong chance

45:21.066 --> 45:23.111
of reaching the quarter finals.

47:31.936 --> 47:34.373
- Greece are just one
good performance away

47:34.416 --> 47:36.854
from reaching their
first ever quarter final

47:36.897 --> 47:38.638
in a major championship.

47:40.074 --> 47:41.641
Katsouranis missed his kick.

47:41.684 --> 47:42.903
Chance here for Russia!

47:42.947 --> 47:44.035
Goal!

47:45.688 --> 47:49.475
Dmitriy Kirichenko
scores the fastest goal

47:49.518 --> 47:52.565
in the history
of the European Championship.

47:53.174 --> 47:55.742
One minute and ten seconds.

47:56.830 --> 47:58.440
- I was just thinking tonight,

47:58.484 --> 48:00.921
Greece's biggest danger
are themselves.

48:01.966 --> 48:04.403
- Russia lead
on Greece's big night.

48:09.625 --> 48:11.018
Gusev will takes this.

48:14.152 --> 48:16.241
Two - nil Karyaka.

48:17.982 --> 48:19.853
Greece are all over the place.

48:21.028 --> 48:22.812
And what should be
the biggest day

48:22.856 --> 48:25.119
in their footballing history,

48:25.163 --> 48:27.643
is rapidly turning rather sour.

48:29.558 --> 48:30.951
One more Russian goal

48:30.995 --> 48:32.866
could put them
out of the tournament.

48:37.001 --> 48:38.567
Here they come-- Karyaka!

48:38.698 --> 48:40.743
What a chance
to remain at three.

48:43.355 --> 48:45.618
The referee blows
the final whistle.

48:46.227 --> 48:49.187
It's finished Russia 2,
Greece 1.

48:54.148 --> 48:56.107
- But the question
in every Greek mind,

48:56.150 --> 48:57.847
is will that be enough.

48:59.545 --> 49:02.591
They are at the mercy
of Spain and Portugal.

51:54.633 --> 51:56.939
- We're playing against
a team that is uh,

51:56.983 --> 51:58.985
just allow us to have the ball.

51:59.028 --> 52:02.206
and just wait for us to lose it
and hit us on the break.

53:17.324 --> 53:19.674
- And for the reigning champions
they're latest defense

53:19.718 --> 53:21.589
is against
the unforeseen challengers

53:21.633 --> 53:24.462
punching dangerously
above their weight.

53:40.304 --> 53:42.219
- He's had the most
extraordinary year,

53:42.349 --> 53:43.742
Thierry Henry.

53:43.785 --> 53:47.398
He scored 48 goals,
in 65 games, in 12 months.

54:00.237 --> 54:01.412
- Henry.

54:02.021 --> 54:03.588
Seitaridis in quickly.

54:04.719 --> 54:06.852
And still Thierry Henry
and deflected.

54:07.374 --> 54:09.289
Seitaridis got in the way.

54:10.377 --> 54:13.641
Interesting tactics from
Otto Rehhagel the Greek coach.

54:14.207 --> 54:16.035
- France haven't
been able to play

54:16.078 --> 54:17.515
any of their fancy stuff
up until now.

54:17.558 --> 54:19.212
Their flare players
haven't flared.

54:19.908 --> 54:22.215
Well here is
the flariest of them all...

54:22.694 --> 54:23.912
Good tackle.

54:30.179 --> 54:32.051
- Henry cannot find
a way through.

54:32.573 --> 54:34.227
- Seitaridis is all over him.

54:34.749 --> 54:36.360
It's a long going battle
between the two of them,

54:36.403 --> 54:37.970
whichever half they're in.

54:58.599 --> 54:59.687
- Henry!

55:04.736 --> 55:07.347
- Everyone expecting
a French victory.

55:07.608 --> 55:11.395
Almost everyone in this French
squad has been there, done that.

55:14.398 --> 55:15.964
Zagorakis away from Lizarazu.

55:16.008 --> 55:17.705
Off the chin of...

55:22.884 --> 55:24.712
- Goal! Goal! Goal!

55:24.756 --> 55:26.758
Goal! Goal!

55:28.020 --> 55:29.891
- Traianos Dellas has scored!

55:29.935 --> 55:32.024
Traianos Dellas for Greece!

55:32.154 --> 55:34.026
We are in wonderland.

55:38.291 --> 55:40.554
- Greece 1, France nil.

55:40.598 --> 55:41.947
Last minute.

55:42.382 --> 55:44.036
- Rehhagel has a game plan.

55:44.689 --> 55:46.212
It's not charming football.

55:46.343 --> 55:48.649
It is suffocating football
from the Greeks.

55:53.654 --> 55:55.047
All the way through
the tournament

55:55.090 --> 55:57.484
we've been expecting
France to kick up a gear.

55:57.832 --> 55:59.660
If they don't do it now,
they're out.

55:59.704 --> 56:01.053
Here goes Thuram.

56:01.401 --> 56:03.882
Thuram good cross,
Dellas in the way.

56:04.361 --> 56:05.449
Zidane.

56:06.841 --> 56:09.191
Shot charged down.
Lizarazu again.

56:12.281 --> 56:14.327
- The French don't know
which way to look.

56:14.371 --> 56:16.198
Beyond belief!

56:19.071 --> 56:21.813
The kings of Europe dethroned

56:21.856 --> 56:23.554
by the Greek gods.

56:24.729 --> 56:28.428
Greece, who two weeks ago
have never so much as won

56:28.472 --> 56:32.127
a major tournament match
are in the semifinals.

56:32.171 --> 56:34.391
They have knocked out
the champions.

56:34.521 --> 56:36.262
- What do you think, Thierry,
when you reflect on this

56:36.305 --> 56:39.004
will be your diagnosis
of what went wrong?

56:39.047 --> 56:41.572
- Well, it's difficult for me
to talk about it

56:41.615 --> 56:43.791
because obviously
they scored on the only chance.

56:43.835 --> 56:45.532
That's a bit poor.

56:45.576 --> 56:46.794
- Question for the coach.

56:46.838 --> 56:49.362
Did you have a specific
tactic or game plan

56:49.406 --> 56:50.624
to beat Santini's team?

56:50.668 --> 56:52.278
How did you manage to do this?

57:12.124 --> 57:14.474
- As I've already said
in previous press conferences

57:14.518 --> 57:17.434
I never speak
about tactics or strategies.

57:32.057 --> 57:33.667
- Ren-- What's he called?
- Rehhagel.

57:33.711 --> 57:35.321
- Rehhagel.
I can't even manage it.

57:35.364 --> 57:36.931
- The Greek manager.

57:36.975 --> 57:38.498
- He says, "C'mon lads,
lets go and tear them apart.

57:38.542 --> 57:40.195
- Like the German calvary.

57:47.115 --> 57:49.378
- Do you quite like the Greeks?
- Not really. No.

58:04.002 --> 58:05.525
- So I think it's
a bit of a shame that Greece

58:05.569 --> 58:06.874
are in the tournament.
- It's horrible.

58:12.576 --> 58:14.534
- I think at one time
they were a great nation.

58:14.578 --> 58:17.015
The cradle of civilization
but it's reputation

58:17.058 --> 58:18.582
has been tarnished
in more recent years.

58:18.625 --> 58:21.454
Cuz now you associate it
with holidays, Corfu,

58:21.498 --> 58:23.761
stomach pumps,
unwanted pregnancies.

58:25.371 --> 58:27.242
- Brought out on a big horse
halfway during the match.

58:27.286 --> 58:28.505
- That would have
worked perfectly.

58:28.983 --> 58:31.682
- Stylianos, how much of this
extends to the coach?

58:34.032 --> 58:36.556
- The coach has
a very big responsibility

58:36.600 --> 58:39.559
for the bad
and for the good days.

58:39.603 --> 58:42.736
So when the team goes well,

58:42.780 --> 58:46.958
he takes a big piece
of the victory.

58:47.001 --> 58:50.178
And when we are not going well,

58:50.222 --> 58:53.138
he takes a piece
of the bad news.

1:01:46.398 --> 1:01:49.096
- Terrific start here
by the Czech Republic.

1:01:49.488 --> 1:01:51.882
- They do normally play
with such a tactic verve.

1:01:52.056 --> 1:01:54.841
They haven't lost a competitive
fixture for three years now.

1:01:55.537 --> 1:01:59.063
- And already evidence of
the Greeks man-to-man marking.

1:01:59.193 --> 1:02:01.239
- Interesting to see
how they fair with that.

1:02:01.805 --> 1:02:03.807
- Oh, clear chance!
- I thought it was in.

1:02:03.850 --> 1:02:05.504
- That's an absolutely
brilliant cross

1:02:05.547 --> 1:02:07.419
to put Greece under pressure.

1:02:07.462 --> 1:02:09.073
How does he not
go in with that.

1:02:09.116 --> 1:02:10.509
Deep breathes, Otto.

1:02:10.944 --> 1:02:13.033
- Greece are walking
rather unsteadily

1:02:13.077 --> 1:02:14.948
along the high wire
at the moment.

1:02:15.383 --> 1:02:17.951
One goal could put them
out of the tournament.

1:02:35.664 --> 1:02:37.579
- And some fine movement
here by the Czechs.

1:02:37.623 --> 1:02:38.885
- Here comes Nedved.

1:02:39.146 --> 1:02:41.845
He's gone for the goalkeeper
Nikopolidis.

1:02:46.850 --> 1:02:48.852
- Under a torrent
of disapproval.

1:02:50.244 --> 1:02:51.985
Greece looking to do it again.

1:02:52.029 --> 1:02:53.421
Rehhagel's way.

1:02:54.596 --> 1:02:56.555
- We're into extra time.

1:03:23.190 --> 1:03:25.105
- That was into Nikopolidis!

1:03:25.584 --> 1:03:27.281
Cech a long way
out of his goal.

1:03:27.412 --> 1:03:28.761
Zagorakis.

1:03:29.066 --> 1:03:30.154
Off sides!

1:03:31.111 --> 1:03:32.721
Good play by Vryzas.

1:03:34.288 --> 1:03:35.463
There in some disarray

1:03:35.507 --> 1:03:37.248
at the back end
of Czech Republic.

1:03:37.291 --> 1:03:38.423
Katsouranis.

1:03:39.206 --> 1:03:41.078
Again, the Czechs
are being stretched here.

1:03:44.951 --> 1:03:46.823
Tsiartas with a free kick.

1:03:47.171 --> 1:03:48.128
Dellas!

1:03:49.434 --> 1:03:51.828
Oh, I thought he'd
done it then.

1:03:52.002 --> 1:03:54.569
Silver Goal warning
if one team scores more goals

1:03:54.613 --> 1:03:57.094
than the other at the end
of the first quarter of an hour

1:03:57.137 --> 1:03:58.922
then that team would be
declared the winner.

1:03:58.965 --> 1:04:00.314
Corner to Greece.

1:04:03.927 --> 1:04:06.103
- Goal!
- Goal!

1:04:07.495 --> 1:04:10.237
Goal! Goal! Goal!

1:04:15.460 --> 1:04:19.290
Goal! Goal!

1:04:20.204 --> 1:04:22.293
Goal!

1:04:28.255 --> 1:04:29.387
- They're in the finals.

1:04:29.430 --> 1:04:31.389
They will believe anything now.

1:05:10.602 --> 1:05:13.735
- Okay so, what did you--
I mean, what did you tell them?

1:05:34.234 --> 1:05:36.541
- It was only three weeks ago

1:05:36.584 --> 1:05:38.891
that the Greeks
shocked the hosts

1:05:38.935 --> 1:05:40.588
in that opening game.

1:05:42.851 --> 1:05:44.592
- The first shall be last.

1:05:44.636 --> 1:05:47.160
It's in the Estádio da Luz,
the stadium of light

1:05:47.204 --> 1:05:50.381
in Lisbon for the last act
of Euro 2004.

1:05:50.424 --> 1:05:52.470
It's the final
that no one could forecast.

1:05:52.513 --> 1:05:56.430
The host Portugal against
the 100 to 1 long-shot Greece.

1:05:56.561 --> 1:05:58.606
- Everybody who is anybody
in Portuguese society

1:05:58.650 --> 1:06:00.304
and government is here.

1:06:00.347 --> 1:06:02.349
What a feeling to travel through
the crowds to be here tonight.

1:06:02.393 --> 1:06:04.656
To play for your country,
in your country.

1:06:05.048 --> 1:06:07.441
- Now the Portuguese squad
arrived a short time ago

1:06:07.485 --> 1:06:08.529
and just look at their escort.

1:06:08.573 --> 1:06:11.315
On horse back,
on motorcycle,

1:06:12.533 --> 1:06:13.926
by boat,

1:06:13.970 --> 1:06:15.928
and watch for it,
it's coming any second now,

1:06:17.277 --> 1:06:18.452
by plane.

1:06:18.496 --> 1:06:19.888
What an arrival.

1:07:10.374 --> 1:07:13.594
- The Euro 2004 final
is moments away.

1:07:13.855 --> 1:07:15.379
- Expect the unexpected.

1:07:15.422 --> 1:07:19.470
Immortality awaits the players
of either Portugal

1:07:19.513 --> 1:07:20.775
or Greece.

1:07:47.280 --> 1:07:49.239
- All hands on deck
for Greece just at the moment.

1:07:49.282 --> 1:07:51.458
They've got everybody
back in their half.

1:07:52.285 --> 1:07:54.505
Looks to me as if they're going
to work that system again.

1:07:57.508 --> 1:07:58.726
And the Greek supporters

1:07:58.770 --> 1:08:01.512
making such
a wonder scene over there.

1:08:29.801 --> 1:08:31.542
- And it's a super ball
to Seitaridis.

1:08:31.585 --> 1:08:34.153
They've certainly got their
sprinting capability here.

1:08:35.023 --> 1:08:36.503
Renaldo has checked back.

1:08:38.592 --> 1:08:40.377
And it's a corner
for Greece.

1:09:01.746 --> 1:09:03.835
- Goal! Goal! Goal!

1:09:03.878 --> 1:09:05.141
Goal!

1:09:06.054 --> 1:09:08.840
Goal Charisteas!
Goal Charisteas!

1:09:21.940 --> 1:09:25.248
- Surprise, surprise,
it's Greece in the lead.

1:09:25.378 --> 1:09:27.859
Three weeks ago,
it was unthinkable,

1:09:27.902 --> 1:09:30.470
now it's simply unbelievable.

1:09:59.195 --> 1:10:03.329
- It's the most emotional people
in the European community.

1:10:03.373 --> 1:10:05.810
When against all the odds,
they've done it.

1:10:06.245 --> 1:10:08.508
Greece are champions of Europe.

1:10:33.533 --> 1:10:35.143
- Millions of Greeks
around the world

1:10:35.187 --> 1:10:38.799
erupted in joyful celebration
at the full time whistle,

1:10:38.843 --> 1:10:40.540
but Athens was certainly
the place to be.

1:10:40.584 --> 1:10:44.501
- In Athens they celebrate.
As only the Greek people can.

1:10:44.544 --> 1:10:46.981
In a city which
will not sleep tonight.

1:10:47.547 --> 1:10:50.681
Scenes which will be repeated
not only throughout Greece,

1:10:50.724 --> 1:10:53.031
but throughout the Greek
communities around the world.

1:10:53.074 --> 1:10:54.859
Enjoy it as only you can.

1:10:56.339 --> 1:10:59.603
Players will become
overnight legends.

1:11:01.126 --> 1:11:04.216
Athens has some
new Greek gods to worship.

1:11:20.493 --> 1:11:23.322
It is the biggest
and noisiest surprise

1:11:23.366 --> 1:11:25.629
in European Championship
history.

1:11:25.846 --> 1:11:27.631
Greece can dream on.

1:11:31.156 --> 1:11:33.332
- One of the biggest shocks
in football history.

1:11:33.376 --> 1:11:34.638
- Congratulations to Greece.

1:11:34.681 --> 1:11:37.728
- Shock and awe
at the stadium of light.

1:11:37.771 --> 1:11:40.861
- The dark days
of Greek football ended here--

1:11:40.905 --> 1:11:42.210
- It'll be remembered
as the tournament

1:11:42.254 --> 1:11:44.300
that shook up
the football establishment.

1:11:44.343 --> 1:11:45.866
- From the shadows
into the limelight--

1:11:45.910 --> 1:11:47.955
- Greeks celebrate
victory in style.

1:12:03.667 --> 1:12:06.278
- Even now the most
unheralded underdog

1:12:06.322 --> 1:12:08.889
can still spring
the greatest surprise.

1:12:11.109 --> 1:12:11.979
- There they are.

1:12:12.023 --> 1:12:13.546
The Greek football squad

1:12:13.590 --> 1:12:15.679
heading towards
a huge reseption

1:12:16.288 --> 1:12:19.639
Fans welcome the team back
as national heroes

1:12:19.683 --> 1:12:23.295
who's names will become
the stuff of Greek mythology.
