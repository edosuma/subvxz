00:01.000 --> 00:03.083
[Damian] Previously on
Designated Survivor...

00:03.212 --> 00:04.794
[Tom] Dax Minter has been arrested.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.754
I'm sorry that you got pulled
into all of this.

00:06.882 --> 00:09.044
I'm not. I made a friend.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.632
I'm moving to San Francisco.

00:10.761 --> 00:11.626
You go get 'em out there.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.094
[Valeria] When this hacking
investigation is over,

00:14.223 --> 00:16.760
you will have learned much about America
you can share.

00:16.892 --> 00:19.054
Maybe enough to keep yourself alive.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.265
-Hannah!
-[Hannah grunts]

00:24.733 --> 00:25.814
[Damian groans]

00:25.943 --> 00:28.150
- I found something.
-[Hannah] Valeria Poriskova?

00:28.278 --> 00:30.565
Minter tried to get rid of me
and make it look like Frost did it.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.780
Who better to hire than a Russian agent
who you've been clashing with?

00:33.909 --> 00:35.900
Valeria missed me and killed Damian.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.447
| can't let you hunt down Valeria.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.661
You lay those down,
you may not get 'em back.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.451
Bye, Aaron.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.143
[gasps]

01:08.110 --> 01:09.942
I'm just trying to find Valeria Poriskova.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.562
-[man] Never heard of her.
-She lives here. This is her house.

01:12.698 --> 01:13.813
[both grunting]

01:20.330 --> 01:21.491
Where's Valeria?

01:22.666 --> 01:23.622
Where is she?

01:25.419 --> 01:27.456
Freeze! Hands up!

01:29.798 --> 01:31.505
You the guy who called 9117

01:31.633 --> 01:34.125
-Yeah, this maniac tried to kill me.
-Who are you?

01:34.261 --> 01:36.844
-I'm Hannah Wells. I work for...
-You work for who?

01:37.639 --> 01:38.470
Never mind.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.764
[officer] Hands on the wall.

01:59.494 --> 02:00.529
[Trey] Kendra.

02:02.706 --> 02:03.867
Good morning.

02:04.875 --> 02:05.831
[Kendra sighs]

02:07.377 --> 02:11.496
| didn't want to wake you,
but do you know where the other one is?

02:12.215 --> 02:13.376
Kitchen.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.170
Yes. Okay.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.417
I'll help you.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.419
No, I got it.

02:19.056 --> 02:19.887
Okay.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.007
I'm gonna show myself out.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.679
Sounds good.

02:28.732 --> 02:29.563
Morning.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.562
Good morning.

02:37.908 --> 02:38.989
[sighs]

02:41.578 --> 02:43.114
Where are we at on the defense budget?

02:43.246 --> 02:46.113
-Sir, we have a congressional consensus.
-$726 billion.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.958
Those are numbers, not substance,
so there must be a problem.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.169
Senators Crowell and Feller
are shifting goalposts again.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.460
This deal took six months to negotiate.
What's their agenda?

02:55.592 --> 02:56.957
We don't know, but something's up.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.631
-Maybe we should find out what it is.
-Yes, sir.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.299
In the meantime,
I'll get the senators here.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.765
Today. This bill is too important.
We need to keep our eye on the ball.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.937
[Lyor] Turn on Beltway Beat.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.890
[Cornelius on TV]
This presidency has finally run aground.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.940
Now, Tom Kirkman is a good man,
a fine man.

03:17.072 --> 03:20.315
But he is an amateur in a job
that demands a professional.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.659
What this country needs more than anything else
right now is leadership,

03:23.787 --> 03:26.870
and I am afraid President Kirkman is simply
out of his depth.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.990
He's taken a flamethrower to you
since the 25th Amendment proceeding.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.744
Lyor, it called the First Amendment.
He can say whatever he wants.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.495
But he can't leak classified information,

03:34.631 --> 03:36.417
which is a crime,
and he's a repeat offender.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.461
No one'd like to prosecute Moss
more than me.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.971
But we all know that it's next to impossible
to prove.

03:41.096 --> 03:44.509
It would look like I'm using this office
to settle personal political scores.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.348
What about a special counsel, then?

03:46.476 --> 03:48.137
Someone with no allegiance
to the administration.

03:48.270 --> 03:49.806
Attorney General Beckett
could appoint one for you.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.269
| don't like the way it'll look.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.981
If anyone else had done it,
you'd prosecute, right?

03:54.109 --> 03:55.440
If I had the evidence, yes.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.185
You can't go after Moss
for political reasons,

03:57.320 --> 03:59.277
but you can't protect him
for political ones either.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.693
-Turn on DC News Daily.
- I hate television.

04:01.825 --> 04:05.739
If I'd left it to the administration,
that kid'd still be in a prison in Bultan.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.908
[interviewer on TV] So, the president
did not help negotiate

04:08.039 --> 04:09.200
Matthew Jennings' release?

04:09.332 --> 04:12.495
[West chuckles] Sure, if by help,
you mean hinder.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.288
-What a pest.
-Not just any pest.

04:14.421 --> 04:18.209
He's a termite, eating away at our foundation.
He's a scorpion to our frog.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.923
| don't think so.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.966
| think he's a solution.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.256
To what?

04:23.388 --> 04:25.720
We want to prosecute Moss,
we'd have to appoint someone

04:25.849 --> 04:29.467
that was considered an unfriendly,
whose impartiality can't be questioned.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.891
Who went after you in the 25th Amendment
proceeding and still takes shots.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.355
Use one problem to solve the other.

04:35.484 --> 04:36.474
That's damn good.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.155
[Kendra grunts]

04:44.284 --> 04:45.695
Okay, okay.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.623
[sighs]

05:02.302 --> 05:04.293
Hi, Trey, it's Kendra.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.338
You left your wallet here.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.391
Sure, I can wait, okay.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.223
Senator, the VA budget has increased.

05:17.359 --> 05:20.897
And I honestly believe our veterans
will get absolutely everything they need.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.738
Not enough to keep pace with inflation,
but billions for unneeded new aircraft?

05:24.866 --> 05:28.234
I'm sympathetic, but it's the best we could do.
You knew where the GOP stands.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.701
Yes, sir, but where do you stand?

05:29.830 --> 05:34.074
You're 20 months into your administration,
still trying to govern as an Independent.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.701
It's the wrong path
and it's not too late to change course.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.293
What exactly are you trying to say?

05:38.421 --> 05:41.584
That on every social issue that matters,
you're a Democrat,

05:42.175 --> 05:44.132
and my party needs a leader.

05:44.261 --> 05:48.175
With all due respect, I'm looking
at a perfectly capable leader right now.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.092
Yes, sir, but I'm not gonna run for president.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.269
We're 16 months from the general election

05:52.394 --> 05:55.603
and you still haven't spoken to us
about your plans.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.313
We have to get our ducks in a row, sir,
and we're hoping--

05:58.441 --> 06:01.274
Senator, you wanna talk about the future
and I wanna talk about the present.

06:01.403 --> 06:04.145
This bill should be our priority
right now.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.897
| appreciate that, sir.

06:06.032 --> 06:09.115
You want our green light,
you'll need some movement from the GOP.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.250
Did that just happen?

06:15.375 --> 06:18.458
Yeah. She's using the DOD budget as leverage
to bring you into the fold.

06:18.587 --> 06:19.577
It's not gonna work.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.501
If we can't get her to compromise,
we'll get Senator Feller move.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.923
Mark it down.
The race for the presidency just started.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.922
-His expression of interest--
-It was a proclamation of disinterest.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.514
-Sixteen months is a long time...
-An eon.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.975
-...except in a presidential campaign.
-Nope.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.606
-So it begins.
-Yeah.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.315
[Trey] Kendra?

06:52.287 --> 06:53.118
Kendra?

07:16.686 --> 07:17.517
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait!

07:18.146 --> 07:20.137
-It's me. You okay?
-[panting] Yeah.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.229
-[Trey] It's me.
-Okay.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.689
-[Trey] You all right?
-Yeah.

07:23.234 --> 07:24.816
Just take this. Okay.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.030
[Kendra panting]

07:30.158 --> 07:32.149
[theme music playing]

07:41.336 --> 07:43.543
[Tom] What matters is that
you're both all right.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.914
-Kendra, do you need anything else?
-I'm fine. Thank you, sir.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.333
[door opens]

07:49.469 --> 07:51.426
Mr. President, this is Detective Pineda.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.090
[Tom] Detective, what do you know?

07:53.223 --> 07:55.510
Not much, sir.
We're still canvassing the scene.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.428
Ms. Daynes, if you could take us through it.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.268
| was getting ready for work.
| heard a sound.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.684
| was expecting Trey... Mr. Kirkman.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.932
And, um... then I heard glass shattering.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.935
| must've got there a few minutes
after whoever did this left.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.561
You'd just arrived?

08:09.698 --> 08:13.191
No, I was there, but then I left.
| came back for my wallet.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.072
Do you think that this was a burglary?

08:16.204 --> 08:17.615
No, sir, nothing was taken.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.239
| consider it an attack
on the White House.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.208
-Detective, run everything through Mike.
-Yes, sir.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.202
We'll keep the circle on this
as tight as possible.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.079
Ms. Daynes, we'll need to get
a full statement.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.422
Thank you. Excuse me for one moment.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.541
Trey.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.799
| Know what you're gonna say.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.342
Firstly, thank God you weren't hurt.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.761
Is that it?

08:40.562 --> 08:41.893
Why were you doing there?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.642
Kendra and I were at that Kennedy Center thing.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.812
We got to talking, got sangria
at that tapas joint and--

08:47.944 --> 08:51.778
Trey, Kendra is part of my staff.
| cannot allow that to be compromised.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.901
| hope you understand.

08:55.035 --> 08:55.866
| get it.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.534
Okay, thanks.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.199
Sit tight. Mike'll wanna talk to you.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.620
Kendra, I'm so sorry.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.335
-You know where my mind keeps going?
-Where?

09:06.463 --> 09:08.500
Every hang-up I've had
in the last six months,

09:08.631 --> 09:11.009
every time something got lost in the mail.

09:11.134 --> 09:15.799
My mind would be going there, too.
But it doesn't mean there's a connection.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.344
| know Ritter is chasing down every lead
but it's my home.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.467
What if they'd found me?

09:21.603 --> 09:25.471
Let's talk about something else,
something that is none of my business.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.686
-Let's not.
-What? It's Trey. It's a big deal.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.070
[whispering] It is a big deal.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.278
Three months since I've been with anyone,
and I manage to hook up with Kirkman's brother

09:33.406 --> 09:35.147
right before someone
nearly Patty Hearsts my ass.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.364
Yeah, the timing's not great.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.359
If I didn't have bad timing,
| wouldn't have timing at all.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.862
-Think this could be a thing?
-It was one night.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.032
It could be another one.

09:42.165 --> 09:45.283
He's smart and cute.
And you know where to find each other.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.284
Yeah, I'll be in the bathroom
with a baseball bat,

09:47.420 --> 09:49.286
and he'll be trying to bash me
with a candlestick.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.538
It's the beginning
of every great love story.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.336
Take the day if need be.
No one expects you to be here.

09:54.469 --> 09:57.302
It's what I expect of myself.
I'm an advocate, not a victim.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.092
-I won't let anything change that.
-[Emily] Okay.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.226
[Lyor] Your title would be Special Prosecutor.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.139
Not interested.

10:05.772 --> 10:06.887
It's a high-profile post.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.263
[West] For an errand boy.

10:08.399 --> 10:11.266
-You'll be a Justice Department appointee.
-Justice answers to the president.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.563
You'll have a mandate.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.027
Complete independence.
The president gives you his word.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.067
My only agenda would be to find the truth.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.692
I'll take that as far as it goes.
He has to know that.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.865
-When can you start?
-Immediately.

10:22.455 --> 10:26.699
Good. The important thing is to avoid
even the appearance of impropriety,

10:26.835 --> 10:29.247
so no coordination with the White House,
none whatsoever.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.040
You answer only to the Attorney General.

10:31.172 --> 10:34.255
| agree, which is why I need you
to do one thing for me.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.465
Yeah, what's that?

10:36.219 --> 10:37.050
Leave.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.552
You realize you were played, right?
The guy you attacked worked for Valeria.

10:47.063 --> 10:50.146
All you're getting closer to
is getting yourself locked up.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.731
What are you doing anyway?

10:52.235 --> 10:54.727
[sighs] She killed Damian, Aaron.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.776
-She can't get away with it.
-You don't know if she's in the country.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.285
Even if she were,
you're a private citizen now.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.447
You don't have cover
for your shenanigans anymore.

11:02.579 --> 11:05.287
-Why are you here?
-My middle name is cover.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.371
[laughs]

11:06.499 --> 11:08.001
There's this other thing.

11:08.585 --> 11:09.450
What do you need?

11:09.586 --> 11:12.920
Ethan West has been appointed
special counsel to look into Moss.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.456
He's conducting interviews.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.424
-You need me to talk to him?
-[Aaron] Yeah.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.467
[West] So, you investigated
former president Moss for murder?

11:22.599 --> 11:24.806
Yes, for the killing of
a British member of parliament.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.095
He was exonerated, right?

11:26.227 --> 11:28.389
He was, but he still obstructed justice

11:28.521 --> 11:31.229
by lying about his relationship
to the victim to investigators.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.815
-Was he charged for that?
-No.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.900
Was Secretary Moss a suspect
in your hacking investigation?

11:36.529 --> 11:37.519
Yes.

11:37.655 --> 11:38.736
But not the culprit?

11:39.449 --> 11:42.987
No. I don't know what you're asking,
because it was my understanding

11:43.119 --> 11:46.237
Moss was being investigated
for leaking classified information.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.455
My charter is to investigate
all of the Secretary's alleged wrongdoing.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.626
-Yours is to cooperate.
-That's correct.

11:52.754 --> 11:56.247
-I'm here to answer any questions you have.
-Good, let's carry on.

11:58.301 --> 11:59.962
[Emily] Thank you for coming, senators.

12:00.720 --> 12:05.089
We have spent billions and billions
of dollars developing the F44,

12:05.225 --> 12:07.011
only to be met with delay after delay.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.180
Simply throwing more money at it
is a bad investment.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.178
You won't say that
when we roll the plane out.

12:11.314 --> 12:14.602
Next to nuclear power, it'll be the greatest
deterrent this country's ever known.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.190
Senator Crowell doesn't agree.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.184
[Feller] Well, she's wrong.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.527
We don't have to spend money
taking care of our soldiers

12:19.656 --> 12:21.613
if we stop wars from starting
in the first place.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.527
[Tom] You wanna know
where I stand on this?

12:23.660 --> 12:25.571
We had a deal and now we don't.
It's unacceptable.

12:25.703 --> 12:26.864
[Feller] I understand
the frustration, sir.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.907
You're trying to wrangle two parties.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.286
Maybe it would be better
if you only had to wrangle one.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.283
Excuse me?

12:34.003 --> 12:37.871
General election, GOP needs a candidate.
You would make a fine one.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.339
| don't know what's in the water
around this place lately,

12:40.468 --> 12:43.051
but I'm not drinking it. Senator,
we're here to talk about the bill.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.761
-Mr. President--
-[Tom] If the election were tomorrow,

12:44.889 --> 12:47.176
| would not run as a Republican
nor a Democrat.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.221
You are fiscally conservative, strong
on defense. We can work with the rest.

12:50.353 --> 12:53.015
-Senator, please.
-The country needs your leadership.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.525
If you're ready to lead,
you need the right team behind you.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.311
We're not here to talk
about my political future.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.401
We're here to talk about the military
spending bill. So why don't we do that?

13:00.530 --> 13:01.895
And you have our position.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.864
If you want a deal,
bring Senator Crowell around.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.194
[Tom sighs]

13:10.415 --> 13:14.033
How the hell did we get to this place
where both parties are asking me to lead?

13:14.168 --> 13:15.670
One of the parties
is circling a candidate,

13:15.795 --> 13:17.206
but they'd rather back the incumbent.

13:17.338 --> 13:20.080
And the other party caught wind of it.
It's a feeding frenzy.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.502
And you're the meal, sir.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.671
This talk of elections
is too big of a distraction.

13:23.803 --> 13:28.138
We need to make it perfectly clear, to both
parties, that I'm inflexible on this issue.

13:29.684 --> 13:32.676
[cell phone ringing]

13:38.901 --> 13:41.154
[ringing continues]

13:43.573 --> 13:47.692
Hi, Trey. I'm so sorry, but it's not
a good time to talk right now.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.943
[man over cell phone] You have
a beautiful home, Ms. Daynes.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.457
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to tell you in person.

13:52.582 --> 13:53.447
Who is this?

13:53.583 --> 13:55.574
[man] I need you to look into
an unsolved murder.

13:55.710 --> 13:58.793
Lewis Garren, shot to death in 2008,
and nobody cares.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.457
| wanna know who this is.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.957
[man] Lewis Garren.
Look into who killed him.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.175
Or next time,
I'll do more than mess up your place.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.098
| was an AUSA back then,
but I didn't work the Garren case.

14:19.233 --> 14:22.476
The file says that a Gabe Herlihy
was a person of interest.

14:22.612 --> 14:23.818
Then the trail went cold.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.904
Herlihy. I tried him
for a different murder: Pete Archer.

14:27.033 --> 14:30.321
But we cut Herlihy a deal in order
to finger a cartel. Witness protection.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.660
That's why the FBI couldn't hang
the Garren murder on him.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.120
He was already in witness protection.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.501
Why break into my place?
| had nothing to do with Garren.

14:36.626 --> 14:37.991
My guess is Garren
is a stalking horse.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.788
-Why?
-Garren was a dirtbag,

14:39.921 --> 14:42.629
with no next of kin.
Nobody would want his murder avenged.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.122
That leaves Pete Archer.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.298
What can you tell us about him?

14:46.427 --> 14:48.634
His family was devastated
we let Herlihy skate.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.172
Mom committed suicide.
Dad went into a grief spiral.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.141
Last I heard, Pete's brother Mickey
was circling the drain.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.852
Herlihy can't be prosecuted
for Pete Archer, right?

14:57.980 --> 15:00.768
Not per the terms of his deal, no,
but he still can for Garren.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.686
We never officially gave him
immunity for that.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.275
Something the Archers might know.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.478
We need to look into them.

15:18.793 --> 15:19.658
-[Hannah] Hey, Chuck.
-Aaah!

15:22.755 --> 15:23.836
Hannah.

15:24.674 --> 15:27.041
| can't help you if you're not working
for the White House.

15:27.176 --> 15:30.043
Relax. I need a sounding board, okay?
Not a lecture.

15:30.179 --> 15:33.342
So, I'm trying to hunt down Valeria,
but she got the jump on me.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.136
She knows her enemy.
She knew you'd come for her.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.385
She double-crossed the Russians
by working for Dax Minter.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.058
Which means if the Russians find her,
they will Kill her.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.602
So instead of skipping town,
she tries to get me arrested?

15:45.194 --> 15:47.686
She obviously wants you
out of commission, Hannah.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.321
Yeah, but why?

15:52.285 --> 15:54.196
Hey, nice talking to you.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.953
This was a great...

15:58.291 --> 15:59.497
...heart attack.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.413
Okay, just for fun, I'll give one last word

16:02.545 --> 16:05.378
to the youngest spelling bee champion
in this nation's history.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.214
This is a tough one. Soubrette.

16:08.342 --> 16:14.088
Soubrette. S-O-U-B-R-E-T-T-E. Soubrette.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.931
-She's right again.
-[all exclaiming]

16:17.059 --> 16:19.926
That's amazing. Congratulations.
Congratulations.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.678
Thank you, pool. Appreciate it.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.475
Mr. President, are you running?

16:23.608 --> 16:24.723
Only from you.

16:24.859 --> 16:29.148
What about reports you refused overtures
to join the Republicans or Democrats?

16:29.280 --> 16:31.442
I'm a registered Independent.
Nothing has changed.

16:31.574 --> 16:32.609
No thought of re-election?

16:32.742 --> 16:35.905
The only thing I'm thinking right now
is about the DOD budget

16:36.579 --> 16:40.698
that's languishing because Senators Crowell
and Feller have decided to play politics.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.370
So I'm inviting them and
their respective parties to come back to work

16:43.503 --> 16:45.289
and do their jobs.
Thank you, everybody, thank you.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.661
-Sir, one follow-up.
-[reporters clamoring]

16:46.797 --> 16:47.753
[reporter] A follow-up, sir.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.750
Did the president call out the Speaker
and minority leader

16:51.886 --> 16:53.797
-in front of the entire press pool?
-Yup.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.420
How do you spell catastrophe?

16:59.101 --> 17:01.229
[anchor on TV] Swift reaction
from congressional leadership

17:01.354 --> 17:02.560
to the president's accusations

17:02.688 --> 17:06.396
both parties are politicizing
the issue of America's security.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.983
-They're taking your words out of context.
-Not the first time.

17:09.111 --> 17:12.729
They're just getting started, sir.
You really poked the bear this time.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.106
You poked the bear,
the donkey, the elephant.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.574
You pissed off the whole zoo.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.818
Which will make a deal on DOD-funding
harder to reach.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.195
If the microscope is on me,
it's on the leadership, too.

17:21.332 --> 17:22.242
Sir...

17:23.084 --> 17:24.744
-Can I be frank?
-When are you not?

17:24.877 --> 17:27.084
The real governance question
isn't whether you'll run.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.829
It's whether Washington thinks you'll run.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.252
And if they know you're not,
you're a lame duck.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.000
| haven't made my decision.

17:33.135 --> 17:36.048
De facto, you have.
The defense bill is a litmus test, sir.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.421
You used it to thumb your nose
at both parties.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.798
Which means they're gonna move on.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.972
It's harder to govern
when Congress thinks you don't want to.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.971
Look, sir, you don't have to declare.
You can just affiliate.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.689
Leave open the possibility
you want to run.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.024
If I decide to run,
I'm doing it as an Independent.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.529
Not credibly, sir.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.816
The last Independent to win
the White House was George Washington

17:53.948 --> 17:56.030
and he'd won a little thing
called the Revolutionary War.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.651
Thank you for your counsel, but
I'm not gonna affiliate myself with any party

17:59.787 --> 18:02.575
-just to pass a bill.
-Then we're out of options.

18:02.707 --> 18:06.826
Then we better find some, and fast,
because this legislation needs to pass.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.165
I'll put out a statement
that the president

18:10.298 --> 18:12.710
-has the utmost respect for both parties.
-No.

18:12.842 --> 18:16.210
It's time to play offense, not defense.
Be critical. Take them to task.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.837
We need to be proactive to get
our legislative initiative back on track.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.305
Which is why I'm gonna find out
who our mystery candidate is.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.640
[Seth] How'll that help us?

18:22.768 --> 18:25.476
If I can take the shine off him,
we'll return to the status quo,

18:25.605 --> 18:27.312
focusing on the DOD bill
and the president's agenda.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.351
For how long?
The election's in 16 months.

18:29.483 --> 18:33.067
-Both parties'll eventually move on.
-And our guy and our agenda are toast.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.402
[Aaron] Why does a special prosecutor
wanna talk to me?

18:35.531 --> 18:37.363
[West] There are allegations
that President Moss

18:37.491 --> 18:39.152
compromised this
administration's security.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.322
They're facts, sir, not allegations.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.572
-Let's focus on one fact: the NASA hack.
-I'm familiar with it.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.665
Moss back channeled with the Russians
without the president's authorization?

18:47.793 --> 18:49.579
Yes, he promised Ambassador Pavlov

18:49.712 --> 18:52.875
the US would not investigate
Russia's involvement with Icarus Astrotech

18:53.007 --> 18:56.125
if Moscow would cooperate
in saving the space station.

18:56.719 --> 18:57.880
How did you learn this?

18:58.012 --> 19:01.846
Hannah Wells confirmed
Moss' shadow diplomacy.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.261
He lied to her during the course
of her investigation.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.600
Hannah Wells. There's that name again.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.346
-She works a lot for the White House?
-Yes, she was detailed here.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.723
Did she find anything
that unambiguously points

19:11.859 --> 19:13.441
to crimes Moss committed?

19:13.569 --> 19:17.062
-Well, that's for you to decide, isn't it?
-[West] So it is.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.072
Let's go through my list of malfeasance.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.238
-See if we can shed some light on it.
-All right.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.701
[Hannah] Chuck, I know why Valeria
wanted me out of the way.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.622
So she could toss my condo.
The place is completely ransacked.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.665
-Anything gone?
-[Hannah] / don't know.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.881
There's nothing here to take.
What was she looking for?

19:37.009 --> 19:39.876
Funny coincidence: Damian's apartment
was broken into a few days ago.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.631
-You didn't think to tell me that?
-You don't work here anymore.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.928
Forget it. What was missing
from Damian's place?

19:46.060 --> 19:47.425
Nothing, we'd already cleaned it out.

19:47.561 --> 19:50.553
So, she decided to toss my place,
thinking it might be here.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.931
-That'd be my guess.
- Valeria gets burned.

19:53.067 --> 19:57.436
Russia's trying to kill her. What could
Damian have that would help her?

19:57.571 --> 20:00.700
Maybe something she could trade Moscow
in exchange for her life.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.486
Where are Damian's personal effects?

20:02.618 --> 20:06.236
Evidence lockup, secure facility.
Don't worry. Valeria can't get in.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.117
Maybe I can.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.586
Press release is out,
criticizing both parties

20:15.715 --> 20:18.833
-for dragging their feet on the DOD budget.
-And not supporting our soldiers. Good.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.801
See? We changed the narrative.
It's not Kirkman failing the system--

20:21.929 --> 20:24.011
-It's the system failing him. How'd it go?
-[Aaron] Hard to say.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.632
West was all over
Hannah's investigation into Moss.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.179
Wonderful. It means he's digging in,
looking to buttress his case.

20:29.311 --> 20:32.178
| hear Moss will be at the questioning,
and he won't take the Fifth.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.521
No, he's too proud for that.
That means he'll hang himself.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.482
-Seth, wanna get a press release ready?
-No.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.602
Lyor, the former president getting indicted
is no cause for celebration.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.525
Who's celebrating?
"It is with a heavy heart

20:41.657 --> 20:43.193
the administration acknowledges the need

20:43.325 --> 20:45.908
to hold our elected officials accountable,
even former presidents."

20:46.036 --> 20:49.279
-So, celebrating.
-The best day ever. [chuckles]

20:52.084 --> 20:54.576
I'm pleased you've agreed
to answer my questions, President Moss.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.794
Against the advice of counsel.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.380
-But I have nothing to hide.
-[West] Then I'll cut to the chase.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.419
Did you leak classified information
to the press?

21:04.472 --> 21:05.212
No.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.554
The negotiations between
East and West Hun Chiu?

21:07.683 --> 21:09.970
Yes, President Lee
did disclose them to me,

21:10.102 --> 21:12.184
but all I did was pass
that information along.

21:12.313 --> 21:14.350
The subpoena the First Lady received
in the Icarus Astrotech--

21:14.482 --> 21:16.814
The mere fact she was subpoenaed
was not confidential.

21:17.443 --> 21:21.562
The items requested by the subpoena
may have been, but I did not disclose them.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.233
The White House's
internal ethics investigation?

21:23.365 --> 21:25.026
Was not a classified matter.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.909
Surely, you can do better.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.903
What about your obstruction
in the Charlotte Thorn case?

21:30.039 --> 21:32.326
-Lying to investigators.
-Well, I did not lie.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.575
| admit I could've been more forthcoming,

21:35.711 --> 21:40.171
but President Kirkman deemed
my behavior unworthy of prosecution.

21:40.299 --> 21:44.543
Now, if you think it is,
| will use his words as my defense.

21:44.678 --> 21:45.839
| did nothing wrong.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.928
For an innocent guy,
you arouse a lot of suspicion.

21:48.057 --> 21:51.391
Yes, and you might want to ask yourself
why that is.

21:52.645 --> 21:57.230
Why the president sicked his personal
guard dog, Hannah Wells, on me...

21:57.358 --> 21:59.440
over and over again.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.524
Why did he do that?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.235
Animus, jealousy, take your pick.

22:02.905 --> 22:06.648
All I can tell you is that
| will not disavow anything I've done.

22:08.035 --> 22:12.245
And if I need to go to court
to vindicate my reputation, I will.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.243
[Cornelius] I appreciate you taking
the time to see me, Tom.

22:18.712 --> 22:21.875
Meeting with an enemy
is a civilized thing to do.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.259
You think I'm the enemy?

22:23.384 --> 22:26.172
Advocating for a special counsel
doesn't make you a friend.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.094
I've done nothing wrong.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.260
Well, if you've done nothing wrong,
you've nothing to fear.

22:31.392 --> 22:34.305
Cooperate with the investigation,
it should be over in a moment.

22:34.436 --> 22:39.021
But it won't be, no.
No, this is just the beginning.

22:39.942 --> 22:42.809
Special counsel is a Pandora's box.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.982
You're a student of history.
You should know that.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.025
I'm not gonna fire him, Cornelius.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.488
He should never have been appointed.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.233
You and I both know the truth.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.949
-And you're gonna be held accountable.
-[Cornelius] Yes.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.286
Yes, I am gonna be held accountable, Tom.

22:59.712 --> 23:00.793
And so are you.

23:02.464 --> 23:07.459
Because if I'm charged with anything,
you know what my defense will be?

23:07.595 --> 23:09.302
I've got a pretty good idea.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.262
You will be my defense.

23:12.683 --> 23:15.550
| was protecting the country
from Tom Kirkman,

23:16.228 --> 23:18.970
his inexperience, his recklessness.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.223
Your name will be my refrain,

23:22.151 --> 23:23.107
my psalm,

23:23.819 --> 23:24.775
my salvation.

23:24.904 --> 23:28.147
And you think that that's somehow
supposed to scare me?

23:29.158 --> 23:31.820
| think it's supposed
to make you see reason.

23:32.661 --> 23:37.030
Two presidents going after each other?
You think that's good for the republic?

23:37.166 --> 23:38.327
[Tom] That's what you're doing here.

23:38.459 --> 23:41.793
You're going to save the republic now.
How noble of you.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.003
I've come here to talk common sense.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.965
But I see you're past that.

23:49.345 --> 23:54.260
Cornelius, you and I have very different
ideas about what's good for this country.

23:54.391 --> 23:57.179
[Cornelius] Yes, but going after
both political parties?

23:58.187 --> 23:59.427
A former president?

24:01.023 --> 24:03.811
If you really think that's what's best
for this country,

24:04.860 --> 24:06.521
you shouldn't be sitting in that chair.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.360
But I am.

24:11.492 --> 24:12.573
[inhales sharply]

24:12.701 --> 24:14.283
Good luck, Cornelius.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.204
[door opens and closes]

24:28.008 --> 24:30.841
[Fred] You're talking about a 20-year-old case.
Let me get this straight.

24:30.970 --> 24:34.838
You're saying my son Mickey
is a suspect in a break-in?

24:35.683 --> 24:38.220
And you think he followed it up
with a threatening phone call?

24:38.352 --> 24:41.686
We just need to find him and ask him
some questions. That's all.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.896
| have no idea where Mickey is.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.850
We haven't spoken in weeks.

24:46.986 --> 24:51.446
| spend most of my time in chemo,
not keeping tabs on my son.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.110
Well, we're worried about him, sir.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.701
Because his red pickup
was seen near Ms. Daynes' home.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.074
[Mike] Right around the time
it was broken into.

24:59.206 --> 25:01.573
If Mickey was involved
and we have to find him,

25:02.167 --> 25:03.578
it might not go well for him.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.747
Why is she here?

25:05.879 --> 25:07.131
To make a personal appeal, sir.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.918
| know what Pete's murder
has done to your family.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.757
What you did to my family.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.761
By giving that animal Herlihy
witness protection.

25:15.889 --> 25:19.757
Yes. And I'm sorry that
Pete's killer wasn't prosecuted.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.725
And I'm sorry you're sick.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.935
Maybe he's trying to get justice
before it's too late.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.309
| don't want any more harm
to come to your family,

25:30.446 --> 25:32.938
-so if Mickey did break into my place--
-He didn't.

25:33.407 --> 25:36.115
| won't press charges. I'll get him help.

25:36.785 --> 25:37.775
[Fred] Help?

25:40.456 --> 25:42.322
| know what kind of help you're good for.

25:42.458 --> 25:45.496
You did nothing to bring Pete's killer
to justice.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.415
And now, you're coming after my other son.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.879
Mr. Archer, I'd think hard
about Ms. Daynes' offer,

25:51.008 --> 25:52.373
which goes against my advice.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.460
Tell us where Mickey is.
Let us bring him in.

25:57.306 --> 26:01.015
| want you all out of my house. Now.

26:01.143 --> 26:04.261
[Pineda] Mickey Archer has no
phone number, no known address.

26:04.772 --> 26:06.934
-We don't have a lead.
-[Mike] Yeah, we do.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.103
You see that picture
Ms. Daynes was looking at?

26:09.234 --> 26:11.350
-What about it?
-Duckwall Bait & Tackle.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.353
It's a little fishing village
in West Virginia.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.856
It's pretty out of the way.
Good place to go fishing.

26:15.991 --> 26:19.074
Or disappear. Let's see
if we can reel Mickey Archer in.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.281
[Mike] That's Archer's red pickup
over there.

26:40.849 --> 26:44.012
[chainsaw whirring]

26:56.698 --> 26:58.439
-Secret Service.
-[Mickey] Oh, yeah.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.532
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.026
Mickey Archer?

27:12.381 --> 27:13.291
[gun firing]

27:30.482 --> 27:32.189
[panting]

27:38.240 --> 27:39.230
[gun fires]

27:45.038 --> 27:46.415
[panting]

28:00.095 --> 28:01.802
We searched Mickey Archer's trailer.

28:01.930 --> 28:05.889
There were reams of material
on the Garren killing, pretty obsessive.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.055
He was trying to make a case
against Herlihy.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.598
Until he ran out of patience.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.313
His father only has a few months to live

28:12.441 --> 28:14.682
and Mickey figured
Ms. Daynes could speed things up.

28:14.818 --> 28:17.435
Kendra, I'm sorry it ended this way,
but I'm glad you're okay.

28:17.571 --> 28:18.936
Thank you, sir.

28:24.912 --> 28:28.496
I've been back channeling with
the leadership about the defense bill.

28:28.624 --> 28:29.955
Their positions have hardened.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.542
-Meaning if I don't pick a side--
-[Lyor] You're gonna be the fall guy,

28:33.670 --> 28:35.957
especially if we can't pass legislation.

28:36.089 --> 28:39.627
Sir, going it alone
is finally taking its toll.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.510
| think you need to pick a party,
Mr. President.

28:43.639 --> 28:44.629
If I don't?

28:45.098 --> 28:48.762
Then we stumble to the finish line,
with no allies and no leverage.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.761
Bring the leadership back up here.
We've got a decision to make.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.137
Yes, sir.

28:56.068 --> 28:59.151
-It appears that we are at an impasse.
-Yes, sir.

28:59.279 --> 29:02.362
We have real differences
with the majority on this legislation.

29:02.491 --> 29:06.200
Yes, I know. Differences that we've spent
months working out together,

29:06.328 --> 29:09.161
until you both tried
and leverage me for political gain,

29:09.289 --> 29:12.452
at the expense of the men and women
who fight and die for us,

29:12.584 --> 29:15.542
who allow us to sit here in this office
and play God with their lives,

29:15.671 --> 29:17.161
telling them which guns they can use,

29:17.297 --> 29:18.913
planes they can fly,
medicines they can get.

29:19.049 --> 29:19.959
Mr. President--

29:20.092 --> 29:23.710
Senators, I have no intention
of joining either of your parties.

29:23.845 --> 29:26.098
When declared myself an Independent,
| meant it.

29:26.848 --> 29:29.715
It's that very independence
that's given me credibility.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.979
Respectfully, sir,
you'll have less if you go it alone.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.095
Perhaps, but not today.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.347
My staff has drawn up a final bill,

29:36.483 --> 29:39.100
one that reflects the bipartisan work
we did together.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.852
And both of your parties will endorse it.

29:41.989 --> 29:42.899
And if we don't?

29:43.031 --> 29:45.864
| will take whatever political capital
| have left

29:45.993 --> 29:47.700
and I will make my case to the people.

29:47.828 --> 29:51.412
| will tell them that I believe
partisanship is ruining this country,

29:51.540 --> 29:53.907
and that their representatives
are more interested

29:54.042 --> 29:55.578
in keeping their power
than serving the people

29:55.711 --> 29:56.917
and the soldiers that defend them.

29:57.045 --> 30:00.128
Everyone in your caucuses will have copies
of this by the end of the hour.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.968
| suggest you get your people
to fall in line.

30:03.927 --> 30:04.792
Thank you.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.684
[reporter on TV] In a stunning win
for the White House,

30:14.813 --> 30:16.724
both parties' senate leadership...

30:16.857 --> 30:17.813
Hey, come on in.

30:17.941 --> 30:20.524
[reporter] ...have endorsed
Kirkman's sweeping defense bill.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.359
-The unexpected development...
-Congratulations.

30:22.487 --> 30:25.070
Thank you very much. How are you doing?

30:25.741 --> 30:27.482
Better. Now that this is all over.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.404
What is it?

30:30.537 --> 30:32.574
| hope this thing with Kendra isn't over.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.947
Trey, I thought I made myself
perfectly clear.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.575
Tom, do you think
I'm gonna embarrass you?

30:37.711 --> 30:39.952
That I'm gonna hook up
with a member of your senior staff

30:40.088 --> 30:41.203
and then blow her off?

30:41.340 --> 30:43.047
| think you have a history with that.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.712
Yeah, one I've spent a lot of time
trying to live down,

30:45.844 --> 30:48.302
but I can't do that unless you let me up.

30:48.430 --> 30:50.797
Trey, this isn't a joke.
Optics are everything here.

30:50.932 --> 30:54.266
| like her, Tom,
not just as a notch on my belt,

30:54.394 --> 30:56.010
but as someone I wanna get to know.

30:56.605 --> 30:59.518
All those meetings
for Alex's foundation I pressed for?

31:00.442 --> 31:02.058
That was so I could see her.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.229
[sighs]

31:05.614 --> 31:06.445
Really?

31:07.616 --> 31:08.447
Yeah.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.119
| think you should tell her that.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.245
[knock at door]

31:20.754 --> 31:21.789
How you doing?

31:21.922 --> 31:22.787
Good.

31:23.298 --> 31:26.416
And by good, you mean bad.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.804
[Kendra] I was an AUSA for six years.

31:28.929 --> 31:31.421
All I ever worried about
was my conviction rate.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.809
Like any decent prosecutor.

31:33.934 --> 31:35.595
So I gave Herlihy a pass on Pete Archer

31:35.727 --> 31:38.435
so he could help me make
a half a dozen cases, and he did.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.429
-The greater good.
-[Kendra] Not for the Archers.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.101
The mom took her own life.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.646
Both of the sons are dead.

31:45.654 --> 31:49.318
And the dad is really sick.
There's no justice.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.826
And I feel like...

31:53.078 --> 31:56.070
the last place in the world I wanna go tonight
is my own home.

31:56.206 --> 31:57.822
So crash on my couch.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.955
You'll wake up with a backache so bad,
you won't be able to think of anything else.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.293
[chuckles]

32:04.089 --> 32:05.830
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.174
I'll go home and get a couple of things.

32:09.302 --> 32:12.431
| will go get your stuff. The idea is
to keep you away from home, right?

32:12.556 --> 32:14.843
-I'll go right after work.
-You're sure?

32:15.600 --> 32:16.465
Keys.

32:19.187 --> 32:20.018
[Kendra] Thanks, Emily.

32:29.698 --> 32:32.065
-What do you want?
-Five minutes.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.110
To do what?

32:33.702 --> 32:35.534
To go through Damian's
personal belongings.

32:37.539 --> 32:39.325
Hannah, you know I can't let you do that.

32:39.958 --> 32:40.868
Why not?

32:41.001 --> 32:44.164
We keep having this conversation.
You don't work for the White House.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.082
You're on a leave of absence.
It's your choice.

32:46.214 --> 32:46.999
| know.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.920
Even if you were credentialed,
it's just personal belongings.

32:50.051 --> 32:52.759
FBI's been all over it.
There's no evidence of anything.

32:52.888 --> 32:55.926
Damian died in my arms.
| didn't get to say goodbye.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.183
| never do.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.302
I'm not looking for evidence, Aaron.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.053
| need closure.

33:08.904 --> 33:11.692
Five minutes, Hannah. No more.

33:12.574 --> 33:13.530
Thanks, Aaron.

33:29.883 --> 33:32.250
"See you at our spot"?

33:32.886 --> 33:34.502
Why would you keep this?

34:19.933 --> 34:21.969
[Damian] Hannah, if you're watching this,

34:23.143 --> 34:24.100
then I'm dead.

34:25.730 --> 34:29.598
I need you to know what I was trying
to hand you that night, on the bridge.

34:30.985 --> 34:34.445
Chelsea, 842 Hammersmith Lane,
Apartment 6B.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.524
That's the address of my daughter Amy
in London.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.822
Because if I'm dead, Valeria will come
for her to close the loop,

34:42.664 --> 34:45.952
because Russia will think that Amy
knows something that she shouldn't.

34:46.083 --> 34:50.328
But all Amy knows is what it's like
to be a 16-year-old girl with no mom

34:50.463 --> 34:53.922
and a father she thinks [sniffles]
is in the foreign service.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.841
A father who, I suppose, is now gone.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.759
| guess it doesn't really
matter now, but...

35:03.310 --> 35:05.517
| want you to know something,
as well, Hannah.

35:07.314 --> 35:10.682
| really wish things had worked out
differently between us. [chuckles]

35:12.360 --> 35:16.445
But if I mattered to you,
even just a little bit,

35:18.199 --> 35:19.860
please do this for me, okay?

35:21.369 --> 35:22.825
Please protect my daughter.

35:23.705 --> 35:26.288
[inhales sharply]
There's no one else I can trust.

35:27.208 --> 35:30.951
842 Hammersmith Lane, Apartment 6B.
That's where you'll find her.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.879
| need a ticket
to London Heathrow tonight.

35:48.396 --> 35:51.138
-I'm hearing they caught the guy.
-[chuckles]

35:52.567 --> 35:54.433
Hi. Excuse me. Yeah.

35:54.569 --> 35:58.153
He tried to shoot his way out,
which didn't end well for him, but...

35:58.281 --> 36:01.364
The guy who's at the root of it all,
Gabe Herlihy,

36:01.493 --> 36:02.983
he's coming in for questioning.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.575
-No immunity?
-[Kendra] No.

36:05.246 --> 36:08.375
Herlihy killed Garren before he went
into witness protection,

36:08.500 --> 36:11.208
which means he lied,
and lying voids his immunity deal.

36:11.836 --> 36:14.089
Good, then you get
to put an end to all this.

36:15.882 --> 36:20.251
Listen, I wanna talk to you
about... last night.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.193
| wanted to apologize.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.772
I'm not really big on follow-up.

36:42.450 --> 36:43.952
I'm sorry if you feel used.

36:44.703 --> 36:45.488
Used?

36:45.620 --> 36:49.409
Well, that's just my MO.
| don't really date.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.621
When I meet someone I actually like,

36:54.295 --> 36:55.456
| tend to screw it up.

36:57.632 --> 36:58.463
Did 17?

36:59.134 --> 37:00.420
Well, I'm wounded.

37:01.803 --> 37:03.760
Being taken advantage of for my body,

37:03.888 --> 37:04.798
-it's just...
-[chuckles]

37:05.598 --> 37:06.929
It's getting so old.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.633
How can I make it up to you?

37:11.813 --> 37:12.974
Dinner this weekend?

37:13.481 --> 37:16.894
Only if we skip the tequila this time
and the home invasion.

37:17.026 --> 37:18.437
Uh, it's a date.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.105
Seth, slow down. Start over.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.824
The mystery candidate,
it's Cornelius Moss.

37:25.952 --> 37:28.535
- I got it from a reliable source.
-[chuckles] Wow.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.449
So he's gonna run for president again?

37:30.582 --> 37:32.698
| knew he was trying to get back
in the game.

37:32.834 --> 37:35.451
When you snubbed both parties,
his stock rose.

37:35.587 --> 37:38.045
There's a million reasons
you don't want Moss to run.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.663
He'd be a formidable adversary.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.587
His candidacy puts a cloud
over the special counsel's investigation.

37:42.719 --> 37:43.550
[knock at door]

37:43.678 --> 37:46.636
-Mr. President, he's here.
-Thank you. I'll be right there.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.803
He'll use his platform
to attack your administration, sir.

37:50.852 --> 37:53.344
| can't control what Moss does
or when he does it.

37:54.105 --> 37:58.269
All I can do is what I think is right.
We'll handle it.

37:59.319 --> 38:01.811
Let justice be done
though the heavens may fall.

38:01.946 --> 38:02.981
[Lyor] They're gonna fall,

38:03.114 --> 38:05.822
unless West gets to Moss
before Moss gets to a microphone.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.571
[Tom] Mr. West, thank you for waiting.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.239
[West] Thank you for the time, sir.

38:10.371 --> 38:13.864
I'm nearly ready to issue my preliminary
findings. I just have a few questions.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.661
And I am at your disposal.

38:15.794 --> 38:19.253
Hannah Wells,
she worked in the White House?

38:19.380 --> 38:21.667
Yes, she was reassigned here
shortly after the Capitol bombing.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.758
There were facets in the FBI that were
interfering with her investigation.

38:24.886 --> 38:26.502
Then-acting director Foerstel and |

38:26.638 --> 38:28.379
believed this was the best way
to protect her.

38:28.515 --> 38:30.176
She was your Swiss Army knife, right?

38:30.308 --> 38:32.766
You had her drop off money
to rebels in Kunami.

38:32.894 --> 38:36.228
If by Swiss Army knife,
you mean that she was versatile, yes.

38:36.356 --> 38:39.348
And, yes, I had her deliver funds
to rebel forces in Kunami.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.896
And to investigate Secretary Moss'
alleged obstruction in--

38:42.028 --> 38:44.110
No, we were in a state of war.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.606
Mr. West, you don't have
the security clearance

38:46.741 --> 38:47.981
to continue this discussion.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.278
As I understood it,

38:49.410 --> 38:51.788
you're here to investigate
Moss' wrongdoings.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.120
-Well, I investigated President Moss.
-And?

38:54.249 --> 38:58.208
| found evidence of bad judgment,
narcissism, pettiness.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.452
-But those things aren't crimes.
-And his classified leaks?

39:00.588 --> 39:03.080
| can't prove he leaked
just 'cause you said he did.

39:03.216 --> 39:06.584
He leaked classified information
to undermine my potential candidacy.

39:07.220 --> 39:08.255
How do you know that?

39:08.388 --> 39:10.470
An internal investigation
conducted by my staff.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.135
Mr. West, motive matters.

39:13.268 --> 39:16.260
Yes, it does.

39:16.938 --> 39:20.397
You deployed Hannah Wells to find dirt
on a man you knew was a political opponent.

39:20.525 --> 39:21.686
That is absolutely not true.

39:21.818 --> 39:24.276
She conducted warrantless searches,
unlawful surveillance.

39:24.404 --> 39:25.519
Where the hell is this going?

39:25.655 --> 39:28.397
| have probable cause to believe
you were part of a criminal conspiracy.

39:28.533 --> 39:30.524
I'll have to notify the Attorney General
of my findings.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.651
Okay, this discussion is over.

39:32.787 --> 39:35.745
And I'm not talking with you again
without White House counsel.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.286
That may be the first thing we agree upon,
Mr. President.

39:41.296 --> 39:46.462
I had the honor of serving
this great country as its 44th president.

39:46.593 --> 39:49.881
Since that time,
we have suffered a crisis of leadership.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.929
And though I never intended
to run for office again,

39:53.057 --> 39:56.550
when my country needs me,
[ answer the call.

39:56.686 --> 39:59.428
Today, I am proud and humble

40:00.106 --> 40:03.064
to announce my candidacy
for the Republican nomination

40:03.192 --> 40:05.479
for president of this great nation.

40:05.987 --> 40:10.322
Cornelius Moss, the once
and future president of the United States!

40:10.783 --> 40:15.323
Moss was right. I opened Pandora's box.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.822
But we don't know
what's going to come out of it.

40:17.957 --> 40:21.541
Ethan West is going to forward
his findings to the Attorney General.

40:21.669 --> 40:24.457
It's not clear a sitting president
can be indicted for anything.

40:24.589 --> 40:25.954
[Emily] That's not the point.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.297
An indictment would precipitate
a constitutional crisis.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.008
And cripple your presidency.

40:30.136 --> 40:33.674
And end thoughts of a second term,
assuming you had thoughts.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.557
[sighs] I want you all
to do something for me.

40:41.689 --> 40:42.520
[Seth] Yes, sir.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.185
Go home.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.185
Get a good night's sleep,
'cause you're gonna need it.

40:49.322 --> 40:52.155
We'll be back here first thing tomorrow.
You know why?

40:52.784 --> 40:53.694
Why, sir?

40:54.369 --> 40:55.825
"Cause we're gonna do our jobs.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.321
We'll keep doing them
until someone makes us stop.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.495
Thank you, all of you.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.261
-Gabe Herlihy is dead.
-What?

41:22.397 --> 41:25.059
He was being brought into the FBI
for questioning and a sniper got him.

41:25.191 --> 41:26.852
We got a snatch
of the shooter's license plate.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.896
-Car came back to Fred Archer.
-The dad.

41:29.028 --> 41:31.520
We don't think he and Mickey
were trying to bring Herlihy to justice.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.693
They were trying to flush him out
of witness protection

41:33.825 --> 41:36.317
-so they could Kill him.
-You need to be under 24-hour protection.

41:36.452 --> 41:37.408
You can't go home.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.032
Emily.

41:43.876 --> 41:45.742
[cell phone ringing]

41:48.214 --> 41:49.716
Girl, you have more shoes than I do.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.002
[gun fires]

41:51.592 --> 41:52.582
Emily!

41:54.679 --> 41:55.544
Emily!
