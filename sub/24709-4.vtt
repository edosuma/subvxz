WEBVTT

00:30.905 --> 00:32.157
WHAT YOU GOT?

00:32.240 --> 00:33.783
LOCAL STREET JUNKIE.
CAUGHT A COUPLE
IN THE CHEST.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.910
HAD A COUPLE OF RUN-INS
WITH HIM. NAME'S
JOHNNY SOMETHING.

00:35.994 --> 00:41.291
JEEZ. LOOKS LIKE
THEY BEAT HIM WITH
A BAG OF DOORKNOBS FIRST.

00:41.374 --> 00:42.834
Simone:
ANYONE ON THE STREET?

00:43.418 --> 00:44.794
NAH.

00:44.878 --> 00:48.631
Sipowicz:
RECEIPT FROM A CLINIC
FOR A JOHN BRADFORD.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.260
HELLO.

00:52.343 --> 00:53.553
HELLO!

01:02.312 --> 01:04.355
Sipowicz:
YEAH, MORNIN'.

01:04.439 --> 01:06.149
I'M MRS. TRUMBULL.
CYNTHIA.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.609
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE DEAD MAN,

01:07.692 --> 01:09.360
BUT I DON'T WANT
THOSE POLICEMEN
RECORDING ME.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.821
YEAH, WELL,
THEY WOULDN'T BE
RECORDING YOU.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.323
YES, THEY WOULD.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.784
THEY WEAR
ALL THAT EQUIPMENT
ON THEIR BELTS.

01:15.867 --> 01:19.329
I MEAN, THEY PUT
A BUG IN MY APARTMENT,
THEY TAPPED MY PHONE...

01:19.412 --> 01:21.331
ARE YOU INSPECTORS?

01:21.414 --> 01:22.791
I THINK...ARE YOU?

01:22.874 --> 01:26.753
I MEAN,
YOU'RE JUST HERE
BECAUSE OF THE DEAD MAN.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.254
THAT'S YOUR SPECIALTY?

01:28.338 --> 01:29.798
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

01:29.881 --> 01:30.840
WELL, I WANT
TO MAKE IT CLEAR

01:30.924 --> 01:32.383
THAT I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.135
WELL, NOBODY'S SAID
THAT YOU'RE A SUSPECT
HERE, CYNTHIA.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.512
IT'S A RELIEF
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT,

01:35.595 --> 01:37.305
BECAUSE I WAS NOT
ON THE ROOF
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

01:37.388 --> 01:38.807
I'M NOT INVOLVED
IN THIS.

01:38.890 --> 01:41.142
YOU--YOU MEAN THE STREET,
DON'T YOU, NOT THE ROOF?

01:41.226 --> 01:42.811
I MEAN THE ROOF.
IT HAPPENED ON THE ROOF.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.480
WHY, HE--HE FELL DOWN
ONTO THE SIDEWALK.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.440
I SAW THE MAN
DRAGGING HIM UP
THE BACK STAIRS.

01:47.524 --> 01:48.983
I HEARD THE NOISE,
AND I LOOKED OUT
THE DOOR,

01:49.067 --> 01:50.610
THEN I HEARD THE SHOTS
UP ON THE ROOF.

01:50.693 --> 01:53.363
HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE
THE TWO OF THEM GOT
TO THESE BACK STAIRS?

01:53.446 --> 01:54.614
WELL, JUST THROUGH
THE TAVERN.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.783
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY OUT
BESIDES MY BACK DOOR.

01:56.866 --> 01:59.160
COULD YOU SAY
WHAT THE ONE MAN
DRAGGING THE OTHER ONE
LOOKED LIKE?

01:59.244 --> 02:00.245
WELL, HE WAS BURLY,
YOU KNOW?

02:00.328 --> 02:01.371
BARREL-CHESTED,
WITH A BEARD

02:01.454 --> 02:02.372
AND A LITTLE
SQUASHED NOSE.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.832
HE WAS REAL
MEAN-LOOKING.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.166
BUT HE KNOWS
I SAW HIM,

02:05.250 --> 02:06.334
SO NOW HE'LL WANT
TO KILL ME.

02:06.417 --> 02:07.460
WELL,
DON'T ASSUME THAT.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.504
I WON'T BE ABLE
TO GO OUT.

02:09.587 --> 02:11.256
MAYBE YOU'D FEEL BETTER
STAYING WITH FAMILY MEMBERS,

02:11.339 --> 02:12.674
IF YOU GOT ANY, CYNTHIA.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.843
I'VE GOT A NEPHEW,
BUT ALL OF HIS SOCKETS
ARE BUGGED.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.887
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
LOOKED OUT THE DOOR.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.682
I MEAN, IT--IT'S ALWAYS,
ALWAYS IT'S--IT'S

02:20.765 --> 02:22.767
CONSTANTLY INTERFERING
EVEN MY THOUGHTS.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.185
I MEAN, IT JUST--
IT--IT--

02:24.269 --> 02:25.854
IT JUST NEVER
LETS UP.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.522
YEAH, BUT YOU SEE,
CYNTHIA,

02:27.605 --> 02:29.357
WITH ALL THIS
INTERFERENCE THAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

02:29.440 --> 02:31.401
YOU WERE REALLY BRAVE
TO COME AND TALK TO US.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.822
WELL, I'M GONNA GO
LOCK MYSELF UP
REAL GOOD NOW.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.408
ALL RIGHT. WE'LL WALK YOU
TO YOUR APARTMENT. COME ON.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.617
ALL RIGHT.

02:46.749 --> 02:47.792
Sipowicz:
THERE YOU GO.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.544
THANK YOU.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.004
MORNING.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.215
SORRY, WE DON'T HAVE
A P.A.A. TODAY.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.300
P.A.? I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.802
AH, IT DON'T MATTER.
COME ON IN.

04:20.885 --> 04:21.844
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

04:22.053 --> 04:22.971
TREVOR BOTSFORD.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.931
I'M DETECTIVE MARTINEZ.

04:25.014 --> 04:25.974
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

04:26.057 --> 04:27.100
I WAS HELD UP.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.352
I REPORTED IT LAST NIGHT
TO A POLICEMAN.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.562
HE TELL ME TO COME IN
THIS MORNING AND TALK
TO A DETECTIVE.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.273
BOSS SAYS
I GOT TO DO IT.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.565
WHAT TIME THIS HAPPEN?

04:34.649 --> 04:35.692
ABOUT 4:00 THIS MORNING.

04:35.775 --> 04:36.776
I'M A CAB DRIVER.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.361
I'VE DONE WITH MY SHIFT.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.363
I WAS GONNA
DROP THE CAB OFF

04:40.446 --> 04:41.406
FOR THE NEXT MAN
TO DRIVE IT.

04:41.698 --> 04:45.034
I--I--I NOTICED
THIS BROWN CAR FOLLOWING ME.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.870
I GET TO WHERE I'M GOING,
AND IT STOPS HALF A BLOCK
BACK.

04:48.162 --> 04:49.539
I GET OUT, AND THERE HE IS.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.166
HE GOT A GUN.
HE TAKE MY MONEY--

04:52.250 --> 04:53.751
EVERYTHING I MAKE
DRIVING ALL NIGHT--

04:53.835 --> 04:55.044
AND THEN HE RUN BACK
TO HIS CAR.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.379
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

04:56.462 --> 04:57.588
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.716
HE WAS WEARING ONE
OF THEM BLUE WOOL CAPS

04:59.799 --> 05:01.718
WITH THE EYEHOLES
CUT OUT.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.386
PROBABLY ONE OF THEM
GYPSY DRIVERS.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.096
WHY DO YOU THINK
IT WAS A GYPSY?

05:05.179 --> 05:07.390
THAT KIND OF BEAT-UP CAR
IT LOOKED LIKE.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.726
CAN YOU TELL ME
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM--

05:09.809 --> 05:10.768
THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN?

05:10.852 --> 05:13.313
MAYBE BROWN, UH,
IT WAS NIGHT.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.314
HOW DID HE SOUND?

05:14.397 --> 05:15.398
HE SOUND DIFFERENT.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.191
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LIKE AN ACCENT?

05:17.275 --> 05:18.443
UH...YEAH, MAN.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.736
WHAT KIND OF ACCENT?

05:20.028 --> 05:21.696
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
DIFFERENT.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.449
WHEN DID YOU FIRST
NOTICE HIM FOLLOWING YOU?

05:24.532 --> 05:28.077
MAYBE WHEN I'M LEAVING
THE GAS STATION.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.454
WHEREABOUTS
IS THAT STATION?

05:29.537 --> 05:30.830
DOWN AT HOUSTON
AND BOWERY.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.623
I THINK A COUPLE OF OTHER
CAB DRIVERS GOT ROBBED

05:32.707 --> 05:34.751
AFTER GASSING UP
AT THAT STATION.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.461
I HEAR ABOUT THAT.

05:36.753 --> 05:37.837
CAN I GO NOW?

05:39.964 --> 05:41.841
Medavoy: ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN GO,

05:41.924 --> 05:42.967
BUT WRITE YOUR, UH,
PHONE NUMBER ON...

05:43.051 --> 05:44.093
Fancy: HEY...

05:44.177 --> 05:45.303
SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE
OUT THERE?

05:45.386 --> 05:48.389
SOME STREET CHARACTER
GOT WHACKED AND FELL

05:48.473 --> 05:50.224
OR WAS PUSHED OFF A ROOF.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.601
COP HAD SEEN HIM AROUND.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.019
THOUGHT HE WAS
PROBABLY DEALING.

05:53.102 --> 05:54.562
ANYTHING TO WORK WITH?

05:54.645 --> 05:56.481
WE GOT A WITNESS
LIVES IN THE BUILDING.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.899
SAID SHE COULD PICK OUT
THE SHOOTER

05:57.982 --> 05:59.400
IF WE GIVE HER
SOMEBODY TO LOOK AT.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.153
SOMETHING WRONG?

06:02.236 --> 06:04.572
SHE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A HEAD CASE.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.366
WHAT, IS SHE PSYCHOTIC?

06:06.657 --> 06:08.493
AH, STRANGE.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.244
HOW STRANGE?

06:10.328 --> 06:11.537
NERVOUS.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.539
YEAH, SHE'S NERVOUS.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.124
TOO NERVOUS
TO TESTIFY?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.543
SHE'LL BE FINE.

06:17.752 --> 06:18.836
THERE'S A BAR DOWNSTAIRS.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.046
WITNESS SAYS
IT WAS OPEN AT THE TIME,

06:20.171 --> 06:21.339
BUT IT WAS CLOSED
WHEN WE GOT THERE.

06:21.422 --> 06:24.050
WE CALLED THE OWNER AT HOME.
HE'S COMING IN.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.386
SO HE CLOSED THE BAR
AFTER THE MURDER, HUH?

06:26.469 --> 06:28.388
GUESS HE'S NERVOUS,
TOO.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.767
UH, IN THAT
NURSERY RHYME,

06:32.892 --> 06:33.976
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS:

06:34.102 --> 06:35.686
<i>POP GOES THE WEASEL?</i>

06:35.937 --> 06:37.939
WELL, WHAT?

06:38.022 --> 06:40.024
YOU KNOW,
POP GOES THE WEASEL.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.026
I'M ASKING IF YOU
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.027
THE MONKEY
CHASES THE WEASEL.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.195
POP GOES THE WEASEL.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.531
YEAH. DOES HE KILL IT?

06:46.781 --> 06:50.034
"POP,"
LIKE IN THE STREET?

06:50.118 --> 06:52.703
NAH, IT'S--IT'S
AN OLD NURSERY RHYME.

06:52.787 --> 06:53.996
IT CAN'T BE
THAT KIND OF POP.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.207
I WAS SINGING IT TO THEO
IN THE TUB.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.875
YOU KNOW,
BAH DEE-DAH DAH,

06:57.959 --> 07:01.546
POP GOES--AND I START
WONDERING, WHAT THE HELL
AM I TALKING ABOUT?

07:01.629 --> 07:02.755
WHAT DID SYLVIA SAY?

07:02.839 --> 07:04.715
SHE DON'T KNOW.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.260
BUT HER BACKGROUND'S
GREEK.

07:14.475 --> 07:18.563
UH, I'M NAOMI REYNOLDS,
A TEMPORARY CIVILIAN AIDE.

07:18.646 --> 07:19.981
ARTHUR FANCY.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.732
LIEUTENANT IN COMMAND
OF THE SQUAD.
HOW DO YOU DO?

07:21.816 --> 07:23.401
HOW DO YOU DO, ARTHUR?

07:23.484 --> 07:25.570
SO I GATHER
YOU WERE HELD UP.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.738
THE TRANSIT PEOPLE
CALLED YOU?

07:27.822 --> 07:29.991
YOU MEAN, YOU WERE
ACTUALLY ROBBED
ON YOUR WAY TO WORK?

07:30.074 --> 07:32.660
A WOMAN WAS CRYING
ON THE SUBWAY, AND I
WENT TO HELP HER.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.537
I WAS PATTING HER ARM
AND SO FORTH

07:34.620 --> 07:35.997
BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME
SHE'D BEEN ROBBED,

07:36.080 --> 07:40.001
BUT COME TO FIND OUT
WHEN SHE GOT UP,
SHE'D ROBBED ME.

07:40.084 --> 07:41.752
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU WERE LATE.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.671
WELL, I LOST MY WATCH
AND MY GRADUATION RING,

07:43.754 --> 07:47.008
SO I WAS FILING
A 61 REPORT WITH
THE TRANSPORTATION POLICE.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.343
WELL, THAT'S A LOUSY THING
TO HAVE HAPPEN, NAOMI,

07:49.427 --> 07:51.929
BUT I GATHER YOU DO WANT
TO WORK YOUR SHIFT.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.431
YES, I DO.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.682
I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

07:54.765 --> 07:56.350
OK. SO THIS
IS YOUR DESK.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.895
YOUR BIG RESPONSIBILITIES
ARE THE PHONES,

07:58.978 --> 08:01.230
TRACKING MESSAGES
FOR THE DETECTIVES,

08:01.314 --> 08:02.690
AND RECEIVING CIVILIANS.

08:02.773 --> 08:03.774
HMM. THIS IS
THE CATCHING AREA.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.026
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
EXACTLY.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.277
BEING AS
YOU'RE TEMPORARY,

08:06.360 --> 08:07.778
I WON'T LOAD YOU DOWN
ABOUT FILING.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.031
OH, I'VE DONE VOLUNTEER
FOR SEVERAL DAYS AT THE 2-7

08:10.114 --> 08:11.824
WHILE WAITING
FOR AN ASSIGNMENT,

08:11.908 --> 08:13.951
SO I HAVE
SOME FAMILIARITY.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.412
WELL, THAT SHOWS
A LOT OF INITIATIVE.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.372
I KNOW ABOUT THE 61s,

08:18.456 --> 08:19.749
EVEN BEFORE MY OWN
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE,

08:19.832 --> 08:21.584
AND THE DETECTIVE
FOLLOW-UP FILES.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.835
Fancy:
VERY GOOD.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.088
MAY I HELP YOU,
SIR?

08:26.172 --> 08:27.590
YEAH. HOWARD EDGAR.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.175

DETECTIVE SIMONE.

YEAH. HE'S IN
THE COFFEE ROOM.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.221
LET ME TAKE YOU THERE,

HOW DO YOU DO, ANDY?

08:55.409 --> 08:57.787
EXCUSE ME.
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.580
Simone: GOOD

08:59.664 --> 09:00.957
Howard:
WHO MAKES THE COFFEE?

09:01.040 --> 09:03.167
WHOEVER'S CLOSEST
TO THE MACHINE.
DON'T YOU LIKE IT?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.126
OH, NO, IT'S OK.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.379
Sipowicz:
COME ON, SIT DOWN.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.007
YOU, UH, GO TO YOUR BAR
THIS MORNING, HOWIE?

09:10.091 --> 09:11.884
UH, NO. I HAVEN'T
OPENED UP YET.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.010
HE DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.512
HE DON'T KNOW
WHY HE'S HERE.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.055
NO, I DON'T.

09:18.099 --> 09:21.561
THERE WAS A DEAD MAN
NAMED JOHN BRADFORD
IN FRONT OF YOUR BAR.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.354
HE WAS SHOT,
FELL OFF THE ROOF.

09:23.437 --> 09:24.522
NO, I DON'T KNOW.

09:24.605 --> 09:25.523
WOULD IT STARTLE YOU

09:25.606 --> 09:27.024
WE GOT A WITNESS
THAT PUTS THE SHOOTER

09:27.108 --> 09:30.027
DRAGGING BRADFORD
RIGHT THROUGH
YOUR ESTABLISHMENT?

09:30.111 --> 09:31.362
USED THE BACK STAIRS
TO GET TO THE ROOF.

09:31.445 --> 09:32.697
DO YOU NEED ME
TO DRAW YOU A MAP

09:32.780 --> 09:34.073
HOW THE ONLY WAY
TO THEM STAIRS

09:34.156 --> 09:35.658
IS FROM INSIDE
THE BAR?

09:35.741 --> 09:37.118
YOU GOT
TO UNDERSTAND, GUYS,

09:37.201 --> 09:39.453
I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE A LIVING
IN A TOUGH BUSINESS.

09:39.537 --> 09:40.997
I DON'T WANT
ANY TROUBLE. I DON'T
WANT TO GET HURT.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.415
I GOT TO DEAL WITH
ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.375
WHAT, ARE YOU
AFRAID OF THIS GUY?
WE'LL LOCK HIM UP.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.710
JUST GIVE US A NAME.

09:45.793 --> 09:46.877
I--I DON'T KNOW HIM.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.588
GIVE ME A BREAK HERE,
GUYS.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.214
YOU KNOW THE GRIEF
I COULD GET?

09:50.298 --> 09:53.009
HOW ABOUT BEING CLOSED DOWN?
HOW ABOUT SOME
OF THAT GRIEF, HUH?

09:53.092 --> 09:54.385
YOU EVER READ
YOUR LICENSE APPLICATION?

09:54.468 --> 09:57.054
YOU'RE REFUSING TO ASSIST
IN A POLICE INVESTIGATION.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.557
I'M NOT REFUSING.
I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.226
WHO ELSE DID HE TALK TO
BESIDES BRADFORD WHEN
HE WAS IN THE BAR TODAY?

10:02.310 --> 10:05.605
HE TALKED TO THIS BOOKIE
WHO COMES IN ALL THE TIME
TO COLLECT--STEVE.

10:05.688 --> 10:06.856
THEY HAD A LONG TALK.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.149
THEY WERE FRIENDS?

10:08.232 --> 10:09.734
STEVE'S FULL OF CRAP.
HE TALKS TO EVERYBODY.

10:09.817 --> 10:10.735
STEVE GOT A LAST NAME?

10:10.818 --> 10:11.944
RICHARDS.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.154
STEVE RICHARDS?

10:13.237 --> 10:15.615
THAT HALF-WIT HUSTLER
THAT NEVER SHUTS UP?

10:15.698 --> 10:16.907
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.
HE CAME INTO SOME MONEY.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.118
HE WENT INTO BUSINESS
FOR HIMSELF MAKING BOOK.

10:19.201 --> 10:23.164
EXCEPT 80% OF THE TIME
HE DOESN'T PAY.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.082
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP
MY NAME OUT OF THIS,
RIGHT?

10:25.166 --> 10:27.126
IT'S TOP OF MY LIST
OF CONCERNS, HOWIE.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.502
YOU GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.754
SAY, HOWIE...

10:29.837 --> 10:31.922
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
POP GOES THE WEASEL MEANS?

10:32.006 --> 10:33.257
W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:33.341 --> 10:35.092
THE NURSERY RHYME.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.594
AROUND AND AROUND
THE MULBERRY BUSH,

10:36.677 --> 10:37.803
THE MONKEY
CHASED THE WEASEL.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.055
THE MONKEY THOUGHT
'TWAS ALL IN FUN.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.598
POP GOES THE WEASEL.

10:40.681 --> 10:44.101
YEAH, I TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING I KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT BAR.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.936
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.403
I-ISN'T IT
THE COBBLER'S BENCH

10:54.487 --> 10:55.571
WHERE THE MONKEY
CHASES HIM?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.448
NO, NO, IT-IT'S
THE MULBERRY BUSH.

10:57.531 --> 10:58.949
MY CONCERN IS,

10:59.033 --> 11:00.326
DOES HE KILL HIM,
THE--THE WEASEL?

11:00.409 --> 11:02.119
I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT POP MEANS.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.121
WHAT'S
THE MORAL OF THE STORY
I'M TELLING MY KID?

11:04.205 --> 11:05.915
WE DON'T KNOW.
WE GREW UP OK.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.000
THAT'S DEBATABLE, TOO.

11:22.723 --> 11:25.309
WE, UH, CHECKED OUT
THAT GAS STATION, LIEU.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.769
THE ATTENDANT SAYS, UH,

11:26.852 --> 11:28.896
THERE WAS A BROWN CAR
HANGING AROUND
EARLY THIS MORNING.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.815
HE--HE TOOK DOWN
THE LICENSE NUMBER.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.818
SAID HE THOUGHT IT
MIGHT BE A GYPSY CAB.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.820
UH, CAR BELONGS TO...

11:35.903 --> 11:37.321
"RAVEEN BHANJI."

11:37.405 --> 11:40.282
WE, UH, WE LEFT WORD

11:40.366 --> 11:42.493
SO WHEN THE CAR
WAS SEEN AT THE STATION,

11:42.576 --> 11:43.869
WAS THAT AROUND THE TIME
OF THE ROBBERY?

11:43.953 --> 11:45.287
YEAH, IT SEEMS LIKE IT.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.414
HEY, UM, BOBBY,

WHERE THE CABBIES GAS UP
AFTER THEIR SHIFTS ARE OVER,

11:56.716 --> 11:59.343
SO THE PERP COULD FIGURE
THEY'RE DRIVING OUT OF THERE
WITH A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY--

11:59.427 --> 12:00.845
A WHOLE NIGHT'S EARNINGS.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.596
A GYPSY CAB DRIVER
WOULD KNOW THAT,
WOULDN'T HE?

12:02.680 --> 12:04.724
AH, DOG EAT DOG, HUH?

12:09.979 --> 12:11.021

QUITE A WOMAN,

12:52.396 --> 12:54.231
ALTHOUGH THIS FELLA'S
PERFECTLY NICE.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.816

THAT IS CORRECT.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.170
I MEAN, THE FAMILY--

13:16.253 --> 13:17.630
ACTUALLY, THEY WERE
VERY THOUGHTFUL,
VERY GENEROUS.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.507
BUT AFTER ALL,
YOU KNOW, WHAT
IS A LIFE WORTH?

13:19.590 --> 13:21.050
I ASK YOU, RIGHT?

13:21.133 --> 13:23.344

13:38.859 --> 13:41.278
NO, WE'RE NOT INTERESTED

13:41.362 --> 13:43.948
UNLESS YOU DON'T WANT

13:44.031 --> 13:45.407
THEN WE'RE
VERY INTERESTED.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.285
MM-HMM. I UNDERSTAND.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.829
WELL, PLEASE...

13:51.372 --> 13:52.748

13:52.832 --> 13:55.209
WE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
A BARREL-CHESTED GUY

13:55.292 --> 13:56.961

14:00.881 --> 14:02.258
I'D RATHER NOT
DISCUSS HIM.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.801
WHY,
WHAT'S THE MATTER,

14:03.884 --> 14:05.219
YOU AFRAID OF HIM?

14:05.302 --> 14:07.763
I DON'T MIND SAYING I'M
A LITTLE INTIMIDATED,
YES.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.807
ALSO, I DON'T
KNOW NOTHING, OK?

14:09.890 --> 14:11.642
I LEFT PRIOR TO
ANYTHING OCCURRING,

14:11.725 --> 14:13.060
IF ANYTHING ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW, DID.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.478

END OF YOUR INVOLVEMENT.

14:16.772 --> 14:17.690
NO TESTIMONY?

14:17.773 --> 14:18.774
NO.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.487
HIS NAME'S BEAR.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.446

14:24.530 --> 14:25.906
IT'S HIS STREET NAME.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.284

14:28.367 --> 14:29.743
YOU'RE LOOKING
ON THIS BAD GUY?

14:29.827 --> 14:31.787
REAL HEAVY.

14:31.871 --> 14:36.250
WHICH ACTUALLY SUGGESTS
THE POSSIBILITY OF
PERSONAL REMUNERATION,

14:36.333 --> 14:39.795
BUT LET'S JUST
HANG THAT ON A HOOK
FOR THE TIME BEING.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.796
OK.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.257
BEAR'S NAME
IS FRANCIS DONAHUE.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.967
HE WHOLESALES COKE.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.260

ON THE STREET.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.803
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD,
THAT'S ALL.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.471

MAYBE WE COULD TAKE
THAT OTHER SUBJECT
OFF THE HOOK,

15:11.744 --> 15:14.038
MAYBE HAVE
A LITTLE DISCUSSION
ABOUT THAT.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.709

YOU KNOW, I PAID MONEY
TO BRING HIM
TO THIS COUNTRY,

17:19.371 --> 17:21.790
AND HE CAN'T
HOLD A JOB.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.293
IT'S NOT BEEN
EASY FOR ME.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.836
YOUR BROTHER
EVER BEEN IN TROUBLE
WITH THE LAW?

17:25.919 --> 17:28.714
I'M ASHAMED.
HE WAS ARRESTED FOR
STEALING IN THIS COUNTRY

17:28.797 --> 17:31.008
SOON AFTER HE ARRIVED.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.010
MY BROTHER
DRINKS TOO MUCH.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.095
HE OWN A GUN?

17:35.179 --> 17:36.096
YES.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.140
HE BOUGHT A GUN
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.892
WHERE HE LIVES
HE DOESN'T FEEL SAFE.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.935
WELL, WE THINK HE, UH,
MIGHT HAVE BEEN DOING

17:42.019 --> 17:43.520
SOME THINGS HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN DOING
WITH THAT GUN.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.647
HE'S ROBBED SOMEONE?
WE DON'T KNOW.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.150
BUT YOU'RE RUNNING A RISK
LETTING HIM USE YOUR CAR.

YOU'RE RUNNING A RISK.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.364
WE NEED
TO ASK YOUR BROTHER
A FEW QUESTIONS.

LET ME HAVE HIS ADDRESS.

OF DOGGING PEOPLE?

18:35.989 --> 18:37.741

IT DON'T MEAN NOTHING.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.293
AND WHAT IF I SAY NO?

18:48.377 --> 18:50.754
THEN WE GOT TO GO
TO YOUR PROBATION OFFICER.

A LONG DELAY?

23:28.115 --> 23:29.282
NOT IF YOU CAN BELIEVE

23:29.366 --> 23:30.784
I DON'T BELIEVE
ANY LARGE COMPANY,

23:30.867 --> 23:32.369
AND I'M QUITE CERTAIN
HE SAW ME THROUGH THE GLASS.

23:32.452 --> 23:33.954

IS IMPOSSIBLE.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.373

24:08.655 --> 24:11.408
MR. DONAHUE'S NOT
THE VOLUNTEERING TYPE.

24:11.491 --> 24:12.909
I'D LIKE

24:12.993 --> 24:14.536
SIT DOWN AND WAIT.

24:14.619 --> 24:18.165

24:29.509 --> 24:30.927
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

24:31.011 --> 24:32.721
THAT MAN WE WALKED PAST
IS VERY SINISTER.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.765
HE KNEW ABOUT EVENTS
BEFORE THEY'D OCCURRED.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.184
WE CAN TAKE YOU
ANOTHER WAY OUT.

24:37.267 --> 24:40.270

35:56.154 --> 35:57.655
Sipowicz: GET DOWN!
GET ON THE GROUND!
GET DOWN THERE!

35:57.738 --> 35:59.615
CUFF 'EM.
Doug: ALL RIGHT.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.075
MY HEART'S
BEATING ALL CRAZY.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.952
AN AMBULANCE
IS ON THE WAY.
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.

36:03.035 --> 36:05.913
I TOLD YOU THEY
WERE GONNA KILL ME.
I--I--I--I KNEW

36:05.997 --> 36:07.665
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT THEY WERE
PLANNING.

36:07.748 --> 36:10.626
I'M ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED
THAT YOU ARE HAVING
A HEART ATTACK RIGHT NOW,

36:10.710 --> 36:12.503
BUT WE JUST NEED TO GET YOU
OUT ON THE STREET. OK?

36:12.587 --> 36:14.172
OHH!

36:14.255 --> 36:15.590
CARRY ME.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.426
YEAH. HERE.

36:19.927 --> 36:22.013
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

36:22.096 --> 36:24.140
THE DOCTORS
WILL PULL YOU
THROUGH THIS.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.516
YOU JUST TRY
TO STAY CALM.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.642
NO, NO. IT'S TOO LATE.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.186
I'VE BEEN IN THERE
TOO LONG.

36:28.269 --> 36:30.605
THAT ROOM'S A POOL OF
BACKED-UP ELECTRICITY.

36:43.451 --> 36:45.369
15 TO 25, TIM.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.537
KIDNAPPING THAT WOMAN.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.539
I TOLD YOU WE JUST
STOPPED AT THAT PLACE.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.458
OH? SHE PUT YOU
GRABBING HER UP.

36:50.541 --> 36:52.168
THAT WOMAN'S
LOST HER MARBLES.

36:52.251 --> 36:54.295
MMM. SO AFTER
YOU FOUND HER

36:54.378 --> 36:57.340
AT THIS PLACE THAT
YOU JUST HAPPENED
TO STOP BY,

36:57.423 --> 36:59.508
YOU FIGURED
YOU'D STRIKE UP
A CONVERSATION.

36:59.592 --> 37:01.636
WORK OUT HOW TO HELP HER,
THAT'S RIGHT.

37:01.719 --> 37:05.890
TIM, THE DOOR'S OPEN
FOR YOU TO WALK
ON A MAJOR FELONY,

37:05.973 --> 37:09.101
AND YOU ARE STICKING
TO A CHILDISH,
FOOLISH STORY.

37:09.185 --> 37:11.687
WHICH OPEN DOOR
WOULD THAT BE?

37:11.771 --> 37:13.814
DID BEAR DONAHUE SAY
GRAB THIS WOMAN UP?

37:13.898 --> 37:15.483
HE TELL YOU ABOUT
THE MURDER HE DID

37:15.566 --> 37:17.777
ON THE ROOF
ABOVE HOWIE'S BAR?

37:19.445 --> 37:20.321
EH.

37:20.404 --> 37:21.864
I'D GET A WALK?

37:21.948 --> 37:23.241
YOU WOULD HAVE
TO TESTIFY.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.329
D.A. PROBABLY DON'T WANT
TO PUT THAT CRAZY WOMAN
ON THE STAND, RIGHT?

37:36.587 --> 37:38.839
HERE'S OUR SITUATION, DOUG.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.967
I DON'T GET YOUR BUDDY
BEAR LOCKED UP,

37:41.050 --> 37:43.511
I GOTTA ENGAGE WITH HIM
IN A ROOFTOP STRUGGLE
TO THE DEATH,

37:43.594 --> 37:45.930
AND HE CAN SQUASH ME
LIKE A BUG.

37:46.013 --> 37:49.183
NOW YOU SEE HOW THAT PUTS YOU
IN SOMEWHAT OF A BIND?

37:49.267 --> 37:51.435
HE CALLED ME,
AND HE ASKED ME
TO MAKE SOME CALLS.

37:51.519 --> 37:52.812
THAT'S MY COMPLETE,
ENTIRE INVOLVEMENT.

37:52.895 --> 37:54.021
WHO'D HE ASK YOU TO CALL?

37:54.105 --> 37:55.189
ETKIN, HIS LAWYER.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.607
DEVLIN?
YEAH, DEVLIN.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.985
WHO'S ETKIN?
UM, MY LAWYER ON
SOMETHING ELSE.

37:59.068 --> 38:01.028
DID YOU JUST
PISS YOURSELF?

38:01.112 --> 38:02.989
YOU'RE SCARING
MY WITS OUT.

38:03.072 --> 38:04.657
WHO TOLD YOU
TO GRAB THAT WOMAN?

38:04.740 --> 38:06.993
ETKIN SAID BEAR HOPED
SHE WOULDN'T SHOW
AT THE HEARING.

38:07.076 --> 38:08.661
DEVLIN SAID THAT?

38:08.744 --> 38:10.830
YEAH. WE KNEW
WHAT THAT MEANT.

38:16.502 --> 38:18.421
SO HOW'D YOUR SHIFT
GO, NAOMI?

38:18.504 --> 38:21.716
I'VE ENJOYED IT.
I ADMIRE THE WORK
THAT GOES ON HERE.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.509
MY GUY SAYS
THAT SHYSTER SCUMBAG

38:23.592 --> 38:25.052
DELIVERED THE MESSAGE
TO GRAB HER UP.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.053
YEAH, HUH?

38:26.137 --> 38:27.513
YEAH. DEVLIN TOLD
THIS IDIOT,

38:27.596 --> 38:28.806
"BEAR WOULD BE
VERY HAPPY

38:28.889 --> 38:30.057
THAT WOMAN
DON'T SHOW UP
AT THE HEARING."

38:30.141 --> 38:32.143
THAT SOUND LIKE
A KIDNAP REQUEST
TO YOU?

38:32.226 --> 38:33.144
Diane: HEY.

38:33.227 --> 38:34.395
HOW'S CYNTHIA?

38:34.478 --> 38:37.064
DOCTOR SAYS SHE'S GOT
A HEART LIKE A HORSE.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.566
SO SHE DIDN'T
HAVE AN ATTACK?

38:38.649 --> 38:40.026
NO, I GUESS SHE
JUST PANICKED.

38:40.109 --> 38:41.819
I THOUGHT THE TIME
SHE'D HAVE THE ATTACK

38:41.902 --> 38:44.322
WAS WHEN THEY PUT STICKUM
PADS ON HER AND HOOKED
HER UP TO THE EKG.

38:44.405 --> 38:47.742
PROBABLY THOUGHT
THEY WERE PART OF SOME
INTERPLANETARY CONSPIRACY.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.535
IS THAT WOMAN ALL RIGHT?

38:49.618 --> 38:50.745
YEAH.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.246
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOUR HUMP FELLOW LAWYER

38:52.330 --> 38:53.664
RELAYED THE ORDER
TO GRAB HER UP.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.750
I THOUGHT WE SORT OF
INFERRED THAT GOING IN.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.585
OH, OH, WE DID?
WE INFERRED THAT?

38:57.668 --> 38:59.253
GOOD WORK.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.756
YOU ACTUALLY GONNA
KEEP YOUR WORD ON
NOT CHARGING DEVLIN?

39:01.839 --> 39:03.007
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ,

39:03.090 --> 39:04.425
WE GO TO BAT ON THE COKE

39:04.508 --> 39:06.052
THAT "FELL OUT OF"
HIS BRIEFCASE,

39:06.135 --> 39:08.262
DEVLIN'S GONNA MAKE THE TRIAL
ABOUT YOUR RECORD

39:08.346 --> 39:10.348
FOR FABRICATION AND
ILLEGAL SEIZURE OF EVIDENCE.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.725
NOW, ARE YOU SURE THAT'S
SOMEWHERE YOU WANT TO GO?

39:12.808 --> 39:14.185
HI.
HI, JILL.

39:14.268 --> 39:15.936
HOW'S IT GOING?

39:16.020 --> 39:17.355
WHERE'D THE LAST ROUNDS
COME FROM?

39:17.438 --> 39:18.856
OH, A.D.A. COHEN HERE'S

39:18.939 --> 39:21.233
WORKING OUT THE SKATE
FOR A COKEHEAD LAWYER
PAL OF HIS

39:21.317 --> 39:23.027
WHO WAS JUST INVOLVED
IN A KIDNAP.

39:23.110 --> 39:24.362
I'M WORKING OUT THE SKATE
BECAUSE I SAID I WOULD

39:24.445 --> 39:26.906
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE INFORMATION
THAT BROUGHT HER BACK.

39:26.989 --> 39:28.324
YEAH, YEAH, YOU WOULDN'T
WANT TO CATCH YOURSELF

39:28.407 --> 39:30.701
FIBBING TO AN UPSTANDING
GUY LIKE THAT.

39:30.785 --> 39:33.537
SO, IF I KEEP MY WORD,
THAT MAKES ME AN ASSHOLE.

39:33.621 --> 39:35.915
RIGHT, DETECTIVE?
AND IF I BREAK IT
LIKE YOU WANT ME TO,

39:35.998 --> 39:38.125
MAKE MYSELF A LIAR,
THEN I'M JUST RUNNING
TRUE TO FORM.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.461
THAT'S RIGHT.
TWIST EVERYTHING
INTO A KNOT.

39:42.505 --> 39:45.341
I TRIED TO HELP GET
THAT WOMAN BACK SAFE.

39:46.759 --> 39:48.552
WHEN'D HE GET
SO SENSITIVE?

39:55.976 --> 39:57.937
HI.
HI.

39:58.020 --> 40:00.689
WAIT 40 SECONDS, YOU CAN
BE THE FIRST DETECTIVE
ON THE 4:00-TO-1:00

40:00.773 --> 40:02.483
YOU'RE NOT
A JERK.
TO CALL ME A JERK.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.402
THEY OUGHT TO
REWRITE ALL THOSE
ORIENTATION TALKS,

40:04.485 --> 40:06.237
HOW MY JOB AND YOURS
ARE ALLIED.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.738
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, LEO.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.073
YOU'RE SMART,
YOU'RE GOOD-LOOKING,

40:09.156 --> 40:10.366
YOU GOT A BIG FUTURE.

40:10.449 --> 40:13.077
ON THE DAYS HE'S FEELING
REAL GOOD ABOUT HIMSELF,

40:13.160 --> 40:15.329
ANDY SIPOWICZ MIGHT
FIGURE HE'S SMART.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.084
THE TRUTH IS,

40:20.167 --> 40:23.254
THE ONLY DETECTIVE WHOSE
OPINION I CARE ABOUT...

40:23.337 --> 40:24.922
IS SITTING NEXT TO ME.

40:25.005 --> 40:26.757
SHE THINKS YOU'RE OK.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.509
YEAH?

40:28.592 --> 40:31.345
WELL, I JUST WISH
SHE'D GET OFF
4:00-TO-1:00s.

40:37.184 --> 40:39.728
SO YOUR GUYS
ARE WRITING?

40:39.812 --> 40:41.939
I DON'T THINK CYNTHIA'S
GONNA HAVE TO TESTIFY.

40:42.022 --> 40:44.108
BOTH THESE GUYS, THEY'RE
ROLLING ON BEAR PRETTY GOOD.

40:44.191 --> 40:45.943
PROBABLY A GOOD THING.
A LOT OF TIMES A JURY

40:46.026 --> 40:48.404
WILL TAKE A WITNESS
IN A STRAITJACKET
THE WRONG WAY.

40:48.487 --> 40:49.780
YEAH.

40:49.864 --> 40:50.781
GOOD NIGHT, NAOMI.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.283
GOOD NIGHT, LIEUTENANT.

40:52.366 --> 40:55.411
I REALLY APOLOGIZE
FOR BEING OVERFAMILIAR.

40:55.494 --> 40:57.288
OH, I MEANT TO
COME BACK AND EXPLAIN.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.956
CORRECTING YOU THAT WAY?
I WAS JUST TRYING

40:59.039 --> 41:01.459
TO DRAW
THAT LAWYER'S ATTENTION
AWAY FROM THE WITNESS.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.837
THINGS IN NEW YORK
ARE SO RARELY JUST
AS THEY APPEAR.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.922
YEAH, WELL,
GOOD NIGHT.

41:07.006 --> 41:09.216
GOOD NIGHT, LIEUTENANT.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.135
JERSEY'S LIKE THAT,
TOO.

41:11.218 --> 41:14.555
WANNA GO SEE HOW
DOPEY AND DOPEY
ARE DOING?

41:14.638 --> 41:15.639
YEAH.

41:19.101 --> 41:22.271
UH, THE LIBRARY FAXED ME
ABOUT THAT NURSERY RHYME

41:22.354 --> 41:23.689
YOU WERE INTERESTED IN,
DETECTIVE.

41:23.772 --> 41:26.984
SEEMS THERE'S NO REAL ANSWER
WHAT THAT WEASEL'S UP TO.

41:27.067 --> 41:29.069
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU,
LOOKING TO FIND OUT.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.988
YEAH, I APPRECIATE THAT.

41:34.158 --> 41:36.827
WELL, THAT'S THE END
OF MY ASSIGNMENT.

41:36.911 --> 41:40.581
I WILL HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL
IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.124
OK, NAOMI.
GOOD NIGHT.

41:42.208 --> 41:43.792
TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

41:43.876 --> 41:45.127
GOOD NIGHT.

41:52.468 --> 41:54.053
HOW COME
SHE'S NOT LEAVING?

41:54.136 --> 41:56.138
I GUESS
SHE LIKES THE JOB.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.725
LOOK AT ALL THESE
ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS

41:59.808 --> 42:00.935
WHAT THE WEASEL'S
POPPING ABOUT.

42:01.018 --> 42:03.270
YOU KNOW,
SOME MYSTERIES
JUST DON'T SOLVE.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.856
MAYBE THEY SHOULD
HAVE A RATING,
LIKE FOR THE TV--

42:05.940 --> 42:08.526
THE CONTENTS OF THIS STORY
AREN'T 100% CLEAR.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.152
EVERYBODY'S ON THEIR OWN.
