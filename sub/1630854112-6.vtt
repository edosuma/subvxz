Oh, oh, hey, honey.

10:35.861 --> 10:36.951
<i> You having fun down there?</i>

10:36.970 --> 10:38.361
It's been pretty cool,
except they want

10:38.380 --> 10:40.213
to catch an alien,
and Mom won't let them.

10:40.365 --> 10:42.623
Well, I'm sure your mom
has her reasons for that.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.100
Hitu, don't!

10:46.705 --> 10:47.962
Aah!

10:47.981 --> 10:49.555

YIM:
Barry, Nina,
I want you to start

11:12.321 --> 11:14.898
at the southwest corner
and work your way up.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.341
-Hey. Captain Nash, 118.
-Byron Yim.

11:16.492 --> 11:18.677
-I'm the captain here on campus.
-What's your status?

11:18.828 --> 11:20.345
YIM:
Evacuation's in process.
Damage seems

11:20.496 --> 11:21.846
to be confined
to one of the labs

11:21.998 --> 11:23.756
on the southeast corner
of third floor.

11:23.909 --> 11:25.666
We don't know exactly what might
have gone wrong at this point.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.168
-Where do you need us?
-Split our manpower.

11:27.262 --> 11:28.928
PFD will clear the rest
of the building

11:29.022 --> 11:31.172
while your team contains
any fires at the origin

11:31.266 --> 11:33.416
and sweeps for casualties
from the initial blast.

11:33.418 --> 11:36.861
Copy that. All right, guys,
suit up. We're heading inside.

11:37.013 --> 11:39.088
Isn't this where Karen works?

11:39.182 --> 11:41.591
-Yep.
-Do you guys think Hen knows?

11:41.609 --> 11:43.326
Yep.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.449
-Oh...
-Mama!

11:49.543 --> 11:51.100
Are you okay?

11:51.119 --> 11:52.711
I-I'm okay, but Mom
didn't come out with us.

11:52.862 --> 11:55.755
I didn't want to leave,
but Zainab said we had to go.

11:56.699 --> 11:57.623
It's okay.

11:57.776 --> 12:00.135
It was the right thing to do.

12:00.795 --> 12:02.536
She was in the lab?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.872
-I think so.
-Okay.

12:04.966 --> 12:08.876
I'm gonna go inside
and find Mama, okay?

12:08.895 --> 12:11.312
You stay with Zainab.

12:14.309 --> 12:16.383
-What do we know?
-Not much. We're headed

12:16.461 --> 12:19.571
inside now to put out some fires
and look for survivors.

12:19.798 --> 12:20.980
Okay. I'll suit up.

12:21.132 --> 12:22.907
Hen, no,
you're not going inside.

12:23.134 --> 12:26.060

Of course I am.

-KAREN: You okay?
-I fell, hurt my leg.

23:13.634 --> 23:15.375
-BUCK: Can you stand?
-I hit my head.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.228
I could only make it in here.

23:17.379 --> 23:19.880
I tried to get up,
but I'm... I'm too dizzy.

23:19.974 --> 23:21.882
Okay, I'm gonna carry you out,

23:21.901 --> 23:24.460
and the paramedics outside
will take a look at you, okay?

23:24.478 --> 23:26.887
All right.
Just get in here.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.464
-Okay...

<i> ATHENA:</i>

23:30.468 --> 23:32.743
-Go for Captain Nash.
<i> -We have a young man</i>

23:32.895 --> 23:35.304
out front who seems to have been
in one of those labs.

23:35.306 --> 23:37.081
-Wait, wait, wait. Stop.
<i> -He's got on a white</i>

23:37.308 --> 23:38.416

<i> Hen is working on him now.</i>

23:42.830 --> 23:44.146
<i> He kept trying to warn us.</i>

23:44.165 --> 23:46.757
Athena, what did he say?

23:46.984 --> 23:51.262
He said,
"Coolant, danger, warn them."

23:52.990 --> 23:54.265
The clean room.

23:54.492 --> 23:55.916
Bobby, you need to get
to the clean room lab

23:56.010 --> 23:57.435
and make sure
nobody opens that door.

23:57.662 --> 23:59.662

23:59.680 --> 24:02.773
<i> on the combustion systems</i>

24:02.925 --> 24:05.759
An infusion of oxygen will cause
a dangerous fluctuation.

24:05.778 --> 24:06.944
What does that mean, Karen?

24:07.113 --> 24:11.115
The room is a bomb
and the door is the fuse.

24:12.118 --> 24:15.177
Copy that. Soon as you can
get her out, you move.

24:15.196 --> 24:17.455
You do not wait for me.
All right, Karen, talk to me.

24:17.682 --> 24:19.014
Where am I going?

24:19.033 --> 24:20.791
I'm trying
to do a blind intubation,

24:20.943 --> 24:23.777
but I... I can't see the cords.

24:24.689 --> 24:27.298
I need you to put pressure
on the cricoid.

24:27.525 --> 24:28.299
Right here.

24:28.526 --> 24:30.784
-The-the what?
-Adam's apple.

24:30.878 --> 24:32.786
Then half an inch below.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.454
You put pressure there.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.198
Good.
Okay, let's try this again.

24:36.291 --> 24:39.718
Cricoid pressure.
Now work and release.

24:39.870 --> 24:42.721
There's just too much blood.
I can't see a thing.

24:42.873 --> 24:44.464
Mm-mmm. I'm gonna
try to do one more thing,

24:44.484 --> 24:46.725
and if that doesn't work,
we're gonna have to trach him.

24:46.877 --> 24:48.444
I need a bougie.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.452
One down, one to go.

24:59.557 --> 25:01.081

Yeah, Eva was, uh...
pretty sketchy

26:17.835 --> 26:20.327
with the details
on the father, but she's...

26:21.322 --> 26:23.038
...definitely pregnant.

26:23.899 --> 26:25.974
Definitely looking at about

26:25.993 --> 26:27.976
at least three to five years
in prison...

26:27.995 --> 26:31.422
I don't understand.
Why would she call you?

26:34.093 --> 26:37.469
Well, she wants me
to take the baby.

26:38.823 --> 26:40.764
To adopt him.

26:42.526 --> 26:44.310
It's a boy.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.188
(scoffs)
Wow.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.692
That's a hell of an ask.

26:53.428 --> 26:56.697
How did she react
when you said no?

27:01.269 --> 27:02.328
Hen.

27:03.772 --> 27:05.664
You told her no, right?

27:07.685 --> 27:11.520
I... I-I didn't say yes.

27:11.613 --> 27:13.780
(scoffs)
But...

27:13.874 --> 27:16.091
you didn't say no.

27:17.136 --> 27:20.971
After everything
that woman did to you...

27:21.198 --> 27:22.956
Why would you even
take the call?

27:23.125 --> 27:24.366
What?

27:24.459 --> 27:27.127
"An inmate is calling from
blah-blah wherever..."

27:27.146 --> 27:28.387
You knew it was her

27:28.539 --> 27:30.205
and you chose
to accept the call.

27:30.298 --> 27:33.642
Yeah, she doesn't
have anybody else, Karen.

27:34.436 --> 27:38.072
She doesn't have you either.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.116
Or least she's not supposed to.

27:42.310 --> 27:44.328
I thought we were building
a life together.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.498
We are.

27:47.649 --> 27:48.815
We're here.

27:48.909 --> 27:50.859
In this house.

27:50.911 --> 27:52.670
And we have all this space...

27:52.821 --> 27:56.415
That you want to fill
with your ex-girlfriend's kid.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.008
Do you know
how insane that sounds?

27:58.160 --> 28:01.161
Can you put your jealousy
aside for one minute?!

28:01.329 --> 28:03.572
This it's jealousy, Hen.

28:03.590 --> 28:04.998
You always said

28:05.092 --> 28:08.102
that you regretted not taking
a stand with Eva earlier.

28:08.762 --> 28:10.579
Well, this is me.

28:10.597 --> 28:12.314
Taking a stand.

28:13.767 --> 28:16.443
You need to tell her no.

28:18.698 --> 28:21.115
And what if I can't?

28:27.022 --> 28:28.414
HEN:
I don't know.

28:30.100 --> 28:32.768
It's so messy and complicated.

28:32.786 --> 28:35.195
We bought a damn house together.

28:35.363 --> 28:37.439
I never imagined
that I'd need a lawyer

28:37.458 --> 28:39.383
to break up with my girlfriend.

28:39.534 --> 28:41.201
(short chuckle)

28:41.220 --> 28:43.870
Hen, I know you don't
want to hear this, but...

28:43.964 --> 28:46.798
This is not about Eva.

28:46.951 --> 28:49.801
Not in the way
that you think it is.

28:49.954 --> 28:52.396
Okay, so, how is it?

28:53.733 --> 28:55.715
(sighs)

28:55.735 --> 28:57.309
Eva's using--

28:57.461 --> 29:01.905
it didn't come from
a recreational place.

29:02.132 --> 29:04.132
The wounds she was
trying to block out

29:04.151 --> 29:07.135
are old and deep.

29:07.154 --> 29:08.487
I couldn't heal her

29:08.622 --> 29:10.080
and I couldn't save her.

29:10.232 --> 29:11.656
But you can save the kid.

29:11.809 --> 29:17.129
Feels like someone in this story
should get a happy ending.

29:18.257 --> 29:21.741
Zainab, thanks
for looking after Denny.

29:21.819 --> 29:23.243

-(chuckling)

34:46.085 --> 34:47.733
Oh, thank God.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.378
We were so worried about you.

34:51.573 --> 34:53.498
Uh, is...

34:53.592 --> 34:55.717
is everyone okay?

34:57.321 --> 35:01.640
-Hitu. Uh, my team?
-Yeah, yeah.

35:02.826 --> 35:05.009
Alvin and-and Hitu--

35:05.162 --> 35:06.919
they'll-they'll need
some time to heal,

35:07.013 --> 35:07.938
but they're gonna to be okay.

35:08.089 --> 35:10.181
Oh, yeah?

35:10.334 --> 35:11.666
And-and everyone else, they...

35:11.685 --> 35:14.853
they got out with
minor scrapes and burns.

35:14.929 --> 35:16.671
And Zainab, she's...

35:16.690 --> 35:18.990
she's in the waiting room.

35:19.860 --> 35:23.328
She was so concerned about you.

35:28.352 --> 35:29.626
Victor?

35:30.629 --> 35:32.020
I'm sorry.

35:32.038 --> 35:34.356
-He died in the initial blast.
-Oh, God.

35:34.358 --> 35:36.716
-I'm so sorry.
-Oh, God.

35:38.620 --> 35:39.878
Denny?

35:39.972 --> 35:42.547
Denny-- what did he see?

35:42.699 --> 35:44.716
He's fine. He's fine.

35:44.885 --> 35:49.187
He's fine. He's sleeping over
at Toni's till we're back home.

35:50.540 --> 35:52.816
Was he scared?

35:52.967 --> 35:56.486
Just worried about you.

35:56.713 --> 35:58.321
We all were.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.382
Right.

36:00.475 --> 36:02.993
I thought I'd lost you.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.163
(laughs)

36:06.331 --> 36:07.647
Nope.

36:07.724 --> 36:10.000
Still here.

36:10.227 --> 36:12.335
(both laughing)

36:15.565 --> 36:17.065
(Karen groans)

36:17.083 --> 36:19.492
I asked the nurse to, uh...

36:19.511 --> 36:24.072
to give me some kind of a cot
or something so that I could...

36:24.090 --> 36:26.074
stay here with you tonight.

36:26.092 --> 36:28.501
No. Go home.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.336
No, Karen. I'm not...

36:30.430 --> 36:32.338
Denny...

36:32.357 --> 36:33.732
needs you.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.194
He comes first.

36:53.528 --> 36:55.453
Mama?

36:55.547 --> 36:57.939
Oh, hey.

36:58.108 --> 37:00.366
Hey, sweetie.
You couldn't sleep?

37:00.460 --> 37:01.609
No.

37:01.703 --> 37:03.887
When's Mom coming home
from the hospital?

37:04.948 --> 37:09.559
I think it's gonna be at least
another day or two before that.

37:09.786 --> 37:11.228
But she's okay, right?

37:11.396 --> 37:14.305
Oh, yeah, she's gonna be fine.

37:14.399 --> 37:18.068
Little bit of rest
and she'll be back to herself.

37:18.219 --> 37:20.320
I was really scared.

37:22.074 --> 37:24.324
I'm glad you were there
to save her.

37:26.470 --> 37:27.661
Me too.

37:29.139 --> 37:32.582
Okay.
You want some cocoa?

37:32.692 --> 37:33.975
Yeah.

37:34.068 --> 37:36.311
You get the cups
and I'll get the milk started.

37:36.404 --> 37:37.671
Okay.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.486
(cupboard opens)

37:44.504 --> 37:46.263
(cupboard closes)

38:08.678 --> 38:10.704
Mama? You coming?

38:14.626 --> 38:18.378
Yeah.
I'm coming.

38:36.873 --> 38:38.723
(baby cooing)

38:39.967 --> 38:42.727
Are we supposed to take him
out of the carrier?

38:42.804 --> 38:44.395
Uh...

38:44.489 --> 38:47.657
Feels weird to have him
on the coffee table.

38:47.809 --> 38:49.734
You know, I don't....

38:49.828 --> 38:51.661
He doesn't seem to mind.

38:51.888 --> 38:54.556
I mean, or we could
call your mom and-and ask her.

38:54.558 --> 38:55.740
No, no.

38:55.892 --> 38:57.316
She will take that
as an invitation,

38:57.336 --> 39:00.170
and we will not be rid of her
until he leaves for college.

39:00.397 --> 39:01.746
(giggling)

39:01.898 --> 39:03.398
We can figure this out together.

39:03.491 --> 39:04.399
Yeah.

39:04.417 --> 39:05.900
(coos)

39:05.919 --> 39:09.662
-(phone dings)
-And with the help of Google.
-Yes. Yes.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.349
-(cooing)
-Google.

39:12.500 --> 39:15.143
Okay.

39:17.522 --> 39:18.671
Hey.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.415
-It's official.
-What?

39:20.433 --> 39:23.860
Senate votes 63 to 31 to repeal
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell."

39:24.087 --> 39:26.196
-(chuckling)
-(gasps)

39:26.347 --> 39:27.680
-Finally.
-So, what--

39:27.774 --> 39:30.425
does this mean I'm about
to be living with an astronaut?

39:30.443 --> 39:31.701
Oh...

39:31.928 --> 39:33.261
Do you have any idea

39:33.354 --> 39:34.946
what that would entail?

39:35.098 --> 39:36.581
There's no way I can do that
with a baby.

39:36.766 --> 39:39.434
But Karen, this was your dream.

39:39.452 --> 39:41.086
It was.

39:42.196 --> 39:44.130
Now I have a new one.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.633
Here on Earth.

39:47.794 --> 39:49.761
With you.

39:51.038 --> 39:52.780
And Denny.

39:52.799 --> 39:56.041
-(Denny crying)
-Oh. Uh...
-Oh, oh, all right.

39:56.136 --> 39:58.544
-I-I'll grab the bottle.
-I'll grab the baby.

39:58.638 --> 39:59.971
-Okay.
-See?

40:00.123 --> 40:01.689
Teamwork.

40:03.551 --> 40:05.276
We got this.

40:07.480 --> 40:09.964
-HEN: All right, easy.
-(grunts)

40:10.133 --> 40:11.699
Slowly.

40:12.802 --> 40:13.743
-Oh...
-Here we are.

40:13.970 --> 40:15.912
We got you set up on the couch.

40:16.063 --> 40:17.472
We made you a little
recovery room

40:17.490 --> 40:20.733
-(chuckling)
-so that you don't
have to get up

40:20.827 --> 40:22.752
and move around as much.

40:22.979 --> 40:24.421
Hen, I'm fine.

40:24.648 --> 40:26.071
You are not fine,

40:26.091 --> 40:28.908
and don't try to argue
with me about it.

I-I'm gonna be back

41:29.395 --> 41:32.730
-You don't have to quit...
-Listen, someone told me,

41:32.882 --> 41:36.067
recently, that my life
as I knew it

41:36.219 --> 41:38.995
was gonna change completely.

41:40.165 --> 41:44.726
Oh, okay.
But we knew that, didn't we?

41:44.819 --> 41:46.911
I'm not sure I did.

41:47.063 --> 41:48.746
I mean, I was-I was dreaming

41:48.898 --> 41:50.656
of being a doctor,
but I don't think

41:50.750 --> 41:52.491
I really considered the reality

41:52.660 --> 41:54.736
of what I'd have to give up

41:54.829 --> 41:56.161
or miss out on.

41:56.181 --> 41:59.090
Being a firefighter,
being a mom,

41:59.242 --> 42:01.059
being your wife?

42:01.928 --> 42:03.728
That's what matters to me.

42:05.081 --> 42:07.431
Grammy helped me
make you a cake.

Are you gonna hug me
every time I come into the room?

42:16.868 --> 42:19.093
Yes.
Yes, I am.

42:19.186 --> 42:22.430
Did Mama tell you she's gonna
be a firefighter again?

42:22.523 --> 42:24.574
Oh...

42:24.726 --> 42:26.692
Yeah, she did.

42:26.786 --> 42:28.527
How do you feel about that?

42:28.547 --> 42:30.454
I think her uniform's
cooler than scrubs.
