WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:01.902
Last time on
Make It Pop...

00:01.935 --> 00:03.337
Are you asking me to
be your girlfriend?

00:03.371 --> 00:06.774
I've got a new title for your
show. The Sun Hi Also Rises!

00:06.807 --> 00:07.775
The curse!
It's real!

00:07.808 --> 00:09.243
What are we gonna do!?

00:09.277 --> 00:11.079
We should put our
feeling on hold.

00:11.112 --> 00:14.115
Caleb and I hung a giant ball
of luck from the ceiling.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.150
(snapping, falling)

00:16.184 --> 00:16.717
Ahhh!

00:16.750 --> 00:20.254
(KERASH!!!!)

00:20.288 --> 00:21.122
(exhales)

00:21.155 --> 00:22.690
That "good luck"
ball almost crushed us!

00:22.723 --> 00:25.526
I guess the good luck is
that it didn't crush us.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.461
Are you okay?

00:27.495 --> 00:30.131
Yes, you know
this makes for

00:30.164 --> 00:32.166
a perfect story about
our first kiss.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.534
One for the
movies.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.569
Where I plan to
play a featured role.

00:35.603 --> 00:36.804
(giggles)

00:38.106 --> 00:38.806
Valerie: URGH!

00:38.839 --> 00:41.609
*

00:41.642 --> 00:43.411
What was that?

00:43.444 --> 00:44.745
Ever since you
kissed me,

00:44.778 --> 00:46.714
I haven't heard anything
but your voice.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.182
Should I have
that checked?

00:48.216 --> 00:49.650
*

00:49.683 --> 00:52.720
Then he saved me from
the good luck ball!

00:52.753 --> 00:54.088
And then...

00:54.122 --> 00:55.823
we kissed.

00:55.856 --> 00:56.857
You kissed Jared?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.392
Like, four times!

00:58.426 --> 01:00.861
And at an average of
6.7 seconds per kiss,

01:00.894 --> 01:02.663
that's 26.8 seconds!

01:02.696 --> 01:04.598
Almost half a minute!

01:04.632 --> 01:05.566
(giggles)

01:05.599 --> 01:07.401
(happy sigh)

01:07.435 --> 01:08.736
Only person
in the world

01:08.769 --> 01:11.205
who'd turn a first kiss
into a math equation.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.407
Who would've thought
out of the three of us

01:13.441 --> 01:15.243
she'd be the first
to kiss someone?

01:15.276 --> 01:16.410
Makes sense.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.845
Like who
would I kiss?

01:17.878 --> 01:19.547
Caleb?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.882
That's a laugh.

01:21.915 --> 01:22.750
Ahhhh!!

01:22.783 --> 01:24.585
Augh!

01:24.618 --> 01:26.420
Good, you're here!

01:26.454 --> 01:27.488
Of course
I'm here.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.789
I have nothing
to hide.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.192
Um, I meant all
of you guys.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.293
I knew that!

01:32.326 --> 01:33.227
Continue.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.328
I composed some new
music for the play.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.864
Mr. Stark just needs
to sign off on it

01:36.897 --> 01:38.566
but I can't find
him anywhere.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.801
Because he's gone to
Broadway to star in

01:40.834 --> 01:43.171
"I Ruined Sun Hi's
Life: The Musical!"

01:43.204 --> 01:45.239
The next time I do
something selfless,

01:45.273 --> 01:48.342
I'm gonna make sure there's
something in it for me!

01:48.376 --> 01:49.743
Selfless selfie!

01:49.777 --> 01:50.911
(shutter snapping)

01:50.944 --> 01:52.146
Focus.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.915
With Mr. Stark gone, Ms. Diona's
gonna try to cancel the play.

01:54.948 --> 01:55.649
(dreamy sigh)

01:55.683 --> 01:57.285
Jared will know
what to do.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.321
Jared's a play-wrecker
from way back!

02:00.354 --> 02:03.391
No, he's ambitious,
creative and a visionary.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.693
Can you fault
him for that?

02:05.726 --> 02:06.860
It's official.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.296
We've lost her, folks.

02:08.329 --> 02:11.199
*

02:11.232 --> 02:13.201
And then
they kissed!

02:13.234 --> 02:15.169
They kissed?

02:15.203 --> 02:17.305
Was it smushy?

02:17.338 --> 02:18.439
What!?

02:18.472 --> 02:21.442
Smushy.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.643
No, Heather.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.413
I don't know, because 'smushy'
is not a word that exists.

02:25.446 --> 02:28.349
I'm pretty sure I
read it somewhere,

02:28.382 --> 02:30.584
or maybe it
was 'slushie'?

02:30.618 --> 02:33.487
Yeah, I'm pretty
sure it was slushie...

02:33.521 --> 02:36.190
How did you make
it to senior year?

02:36.224 --> 02:38.292
I copied a lot of
people's homework.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.527
It took a village.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.594
Exactly.

02:40.628 --> 02:43.797
So if you expect to
graduate, show some loyalty.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.566
I'm here to serve.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.968
Shakespeare said that.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.870
Or maybe it was
a waitress.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.473
I always get those
two confused.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.809
So what are we going to do
about those two lovebirds?

02:55.843 --> 02:56.977
I'll think of something.

02:57.010 --> 03:01.515
But, as always, my beauty
and charm will win the day.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.416
(screams)

03:02.450 --> 03:02.983
(giggles)

03:03.016 --> 03:03.984
* Make it pop,

03:04.017 --> 03:05.986
* Woo, woo

03:06.019 --> 03:07.388
* Make it pop,

03:07.421 --> 03:10.491
* Woo Woo,

03:10.524 --> 03:13.327
* I can't wait,
No I can't wait. *

03:13.361 --> 03:15.996
* No, I can't wait,
no I can't wait. *

03:16.029 --> 03:17.598
* So make it pop,

03:17.631 --> 03:19.833
* We're bout to,
We're bout to blow, *

03:19.867 --> 03:21.435
* Wait till we drop,

03:21.469 --> 03:23.437
* Oh yeah, we're
Ready to go *

03:23.471 --> 03:24.472
* Ain't gonna stop,

03:24.505 --> 03:26.840
* When is it time
for the show *

03:26.874 --> 03:29.743
* We make it, you make
it, they make it *

03:29.777 --> 03:32.580
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop *

03:32.980 --> 03:34.081
(bell rings)

03:34.114 --> 03:37.351
Today, you'll be participating
in a parenthood project.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.720
I teach this
workshop every year!

03:39.753 --> 03:43.957
In pairs, you'll be given an
egg to treat as your own baby.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.959
(groans)

03:45.993 --> 03:47.428
I'm not good
with eggs.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.563
So fragile and
easily broken.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.365
I can't relate
to them.

03:51.399 --> 03:54.668
This is about knowing that
you can care for others,

03:54.702 --> 03:57.405
which will
serve you well.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.740
Caring for others has
not served me well.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.443
Remember what happened
the last time I cared?

04:02.476 --> 04:04.678
These eggs will get a
TV show before me...

04:04.712 --> 04:06.780
Conversely, those who
break their eggs

04:06.814 --> 04:08.716
will be docked
major points.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.819
And that my friends,
is no yolk.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.721
(laughs)

04:13.754 --> 04:14.955
I crack me up.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.591
Oh I did it again.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.826
(class groaning)

04:18.859 --> 04:22.563
Everyone, your eggs and reports
are due back here at three!

04:22.596 --> 04:23.597
Sun Hi--

04:23.631 --> 04:25.433
--you will be working
with Dylan.

04:25.466 --> 04:26.334
Great.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.000
Mr. Chatty.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.669
Should be fun.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.871
I hope the egg
gets my personality.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.741
That attitude just made you the
proud parents of quadruplets.

04:33.774 --> 04:34.708
Here you go.

04:34.742 --> 04:35.976
Quadruplets?

04:36.009 --> 04:36.877
Careful, Ms. Song.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.679
I can make it quints.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.513
(outraged gasp)

04:42.450 --> 04:44.685
And you'll be
working alone, Corki.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.687
What? Why?

04:46.720 --> 04:49.723
Because sometimes, even a smart
attractive woman ends up alone,

04:49.757 --> 04:52.426
eating ice cream in her
apartment on a Saturday night

04:52.460 --> 04:55.929
wondering if she devoted
too much time to her career.

04:55.963 --> 05:00.401
And we have an odd
number of students.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.470
So I have to be
a single mother?

05:02.503 --> 05:04.505
That's the hardest
job there is!

05:04.538 --> 05:05.706
You're gonna
be great.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.844
Ah. Jodi, you'll be
working with Caleb.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.546
Awesome!

05:12.580 --> 05:15.916
Um, I mean,
whatever.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.951
Yeah, totally.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.687
What... ever.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.455
I'm glad you're
equally indifferent.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.692
Heather, you will be
working with Jared.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.829
Actually I believe
Heather will be

05:28.862 --> 05:31.399
handing her parental
rights over to me.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.634
She's an unfit
egg mother.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.968
Or so they say.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.370
They do?

05:36.404 --> 05:37.871
Who said that?!

05:38.806 --> 05:42.810
Ohhhhhhhh, right.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.545
What she said.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.880
Awwww. It's perfect.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.816
Just like Jared.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.452
And me.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.554
(bell rings)

05:53.587 --> 05:57.458
Jodi: Okay, let's
take it from the top.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.459
*

05:58.492 --> 06:05.699
* Everybody's searching
for the same light, *

06:05.733 --> 06:13.073
* Wishing on a dream
inside their hearts, *

06:13.106 --> 06:19.513
* Let's go, let's find a
spark we can ignite, *

06:19.547 --> 06:28.589
* Together, together

06:28.622 --> 06:38.632
*

06:38.666 --> 06:44.772
*

06:44.805 --> 06:46.807
* All around the world,

06:46.840 --> 06:48.976
* People looking for love.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.744
* All around the world,

06:50.778 --> 06:52.446
* All around the world,

06:52.480 --> 06:54.982
* Yeah, all around the world

06:55.015 --> 06:56.617
* Looking for love,

06:56.650 --> 07:00.821
* Looking for love,

07:00.854 --> 07:08.228
* So many of us wanna
make a difference. *

07:08.261 --> 07:15.936
* United we can turn
it all around. *

07:15.969 --> 07:22.610
* We need to feed the flame
and make it stronger, *

07:22.643 --> 07:33.086
* Together, together,

07:33.120 --> 07:40.694
* Wherever we go, whatever
we dream, it's somewhere *

07:40.728 --> 07:48.201
* We're hoping to find, we know
in our minds, it's out there *

07:48.235 --> 07:55.776
* Ooooh ooooh...

07:55.809 --> 08:06.720
* Yeaaah, yeaaah....

08:06.754 --> 08:08.856
* All: All around the world

08:08.889 --> 08:10.791
* People looking for love,

08:10.824 --> 08:12.660
* All around the world,

08:12.693 --> 08:14.194
* All around the world,

08:14.227 --> 08:18.832
* All around the world,
Looking for love, *

08:18.866 --> 08:20.534
* Looking for love.

08:20.568 --> 08:21.869
* Yeah, yeah

08:21.902 --> 08:24.104
* All around the world

08:26.640 --> 08:30.177
Jared, let's spend some
quality family time together.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.879
You can't put
it in there!

08:31.912 --> 08:33.947
Do you want to
scramble our baby?

08:33.981 --> 08:35.549
It's an egg.

08:35.583 --> 08:36.817
Oh!

08:36.850 --> 08:42.556
*

08:42.590 --> 08:43.957
Okay.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.192
Let's name
our baby.

08:45.225 --> 08:48.028
How about
Jared Junior?

08:48.061 --> 08:51.732
Well, it is a
hero's name,

08:51.765 --> 08:54.868
but I wouldn't want anyone
getting us confused.

08:54.902 --> 08:58.038
Better go with
Jaredina.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.608
(giggles)

09:01.008 --> 09:03.110
I wonder what
Corki named her baby.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.211
Probably something
classic.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.278
(groans)

09:05.312 --> 09:06.413
I should go
ask her.

09:06.446 --> 09:10.250
I mean it must be hard raising
a little one on your own.

09:12.152 --> 09:16.790
They're eggs,
Jared!! Eggs!!

09:16.824 --> 09:19.259
Guess this is our chance
to see if we're compatible.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.328
It's weird to go
from our first kiss

09:21.361 --> 09:23.764
to raising an egg
in just a few days.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.134
Aww, he has your
oval shaped head.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.169
And your smooth
complexion.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.771
He'll probably
become a musician.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.640
Or a fashion mogul.

09:32.673 --> 09:38.345
*

09:38.378 --> 09:40.614
Noooooooooo!

09:40.648 --> 09:45.753
*

09:47.855 --> 09:48.656
(relieved sigh)

09:48.689 --> 09:50.991
But he might be kind
of a klutz, too.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.259
I don't mind
a klutz--

09:52.292 --> 09:54.327
as long as he can
survive our parenting.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.865
*

09:57.898 --> 09:59.199
(horrified gasp)

09:59.232 --> 10:00.968
You're eating one
of our babies?

10:01.001 --> 10:02.169
You monster!

10:04.037 --> 10:07.174
Phewph. Okay.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.642
So our babies' names are

10:08.676 --> 10:12.913
Sun Hi 1, Sun Hi 2,
Sun Hi 3 and Rihanna.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.382
After my
grandmother.

10:15.415 --> 10:18.886
Don't you even care
about our egg babies?

10:18.919 --> 10:22.956
Dylan, monks who have vowed
silence are chattier than you!

10:22.990 --> 10:25.292
How did I ever have
egg babies with you?

10:25.325 --> 10:26.426
Oh my gosh.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.362
*

10:29.396 --> 10:30.864
Ms. Donia:
Attention please.

10:30.898 --> 10:33.066
We've had our
first egg casualty.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.970
Karen and Bethany dropped their
egg while running to class.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.305
Shameful.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.841
Hey honey, how about
we get a sitter

10:40.874 --> 10:42.109
and go out
somewhere alone?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.111
I can't trust
anyone with our egg

10:44.144 --> 10:45.345
after hearing
news like that!

10:45.378 --> 10:46.379
Right...

10:48.381 --> 10:50.884
Meifeng is what
Corki named her baby.

10:50.918 --> 10:53.120
It means
beautiful wind.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.855
Breathtaking.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.424
Hello. I'm the head
of the Spirit Squad!

10:57.457 --> 10:58.325
You couldn't
possibly prefer

10:58.358 --> 11:01.061
a ninth grader over your
gorgeous egg wife.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.864
Valerie, this is
just pretend.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.699
What I have with
Corki is real.

11:05.733 --> 11:08.135
Real? I think it's time
someone told Corki

11:08.168 --> 11:09.870
just how real your
feelings are.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.705
Wait, Valerie, what
are you doing?

11:12.439 --> 11:13.406
Corki.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.341
Hi.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.143
I couldn't help but
notice you and Jared

11:16.176 --> 11:19.880
making googly eyes at each
other all the time--

11:19.913 --> 11:22.382
Oh um, we were just getting
to know one another.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.785
Yeah well, before you make
everyone around you barf,

11:24.818 --> 11:26.219
you may wanna
know the reason

11:26.253 --> 11:28.221
as to why he's hanging
out with you.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.456
Corki, don't
listen to her--

11:29.489 --> 11:30.690
To win a bet, Corki!

11:30.724 --> 11:33.260
His pals bet that he
couldn't get the next girl

11:33.293 --> 11:35.495
who walked in the
school to fall for him.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.264
That girl was you.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.365
What?

11:38.398 --> 11:40.067
...A bet?

11:40.100 --> 11:41.034
Yes!

11:41.068 --> 11:43.370
And everyone
knows.

11:43.403 --> 11:48.075
Well, everyone important --
not you or your little friends.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.843
Anyhoo, he won.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.746
That little kiss I
saw sealed the deal.

11:52.780 --> 11:56.316
*

11:57.084 --> 11:59.052
*

11:59.086 --> 11:59.953
Is it true?

12:03.323 --> 12:05.025
I was a bet?

12:05.058 --> 12:05.859
No!

12:05.893 --> 12:07.961
Well, yes, but I--

12:07.995 --> 12:16.870
*

12:16.904 --> 12:20.273
See? Corki finally knowing
that will set you free.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.142
Free to date other
people, that is.

12:22.175 --> 12:25.412
*

12:25.445 --> 12:26.947
Okay Sweetie.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.115
See you later!

12:28.148 --> 12:29.316
*

12:29.349 --> 12:34.187
(crying)

12:34.221 --> 12:35.488
I told you.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.925
Senior guys can't
be trusted.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.828
But I never imagined it
would be as bad as this.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.229
We're so
sorry, Corki.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.864
(crying)

12:43.897 --> 12:46.566
(phone ringing)

12:46.599 --> 12:50.403
(crying)

12:50.437 --> 12:51.071
Wow.

12:51.104 --> 12:51.872
Not answering
her phone.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.874
That's how you
know this is bad.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.308
What are we
going to do?

12:55.342 --> 12:57.044
(Corki crying)

12:57.077 --> 13:00.313
*

13:00.347 --> 13:07.520
* Yeah yeah, oooh.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.891
* Remember when we
first met, that moment, *

13:10.924 --> 13:15.595
* I looked at you and I
knew that this was it,*

13:15.628 --> 13:18.131
* Oh oh,

13:18.165 --> 13:21.401
* I know you saw right
through me, and clearly, *

13:21.434 --> 13:25.873
* We felt something that
words could not describe, *

13:25.906 --> 13:28.341
* We both saw the signs.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.178
* The way you'd
talk to me, talk to me, *

13:31.211 --> 13:33.246
* and take a
walk with me, *

13:33.280 --> 13:39.386
* I'd been waiting for this
for so long, yeah, yeah. *

13:39.419 --> 13:42.022
* The way you held
me, and told me, *

13:42.055 --> 13:43.490
* one more
dance maybe, *

13:43.523 --> 13:47.995
* Remember how I felt
it oh so strong, *

13:48.028 --> 13:50.998
* I could not
believe it, *

13:51.031 --> 13:56.236
* I will be here,
right by your side, *

13:56.269 --> 14:01.008
* All I can do, is
watch over you, *

14:01.041 --> 14:06.146
* Oh I don't know if
you feel the same, *

14:06.179 --> 14:09.316
* Still I'm
wondering now, *

14:09.349 --> 14:11.919
* Baby do you
know my name, *

14:11.952 --> 14:15.055
* Nowadays you pass
me on my street, *

14:15.088 --> 14:19.259
* but you don't
realize I'm watching you, *

14:19.292 --> 14:22.229
* I'm not getting
through, *

14:22.262 --> 14:26.633
* How can I get to tell you,
show you, I still love you, *

14:26.666 --> 14:29.269
* How can I make you
make you see, *

14:29.302 --> 14:32.072
* You should be sorry,

14:32.105 --> 14:33.473
* Woooaaaah,

14:33.506 --> 14:35.909
* Ooh yeah.

14:35.943 --> 14:40.313
* Baby can you see it, the
starry sky is above you, *

14:40.347 --> 14:44.217
* I just wanna hold you,
and take you on a ride, *

14:44.251 --> 14:46.386
* Ooh yeah.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.989
* Wish that you
could feel it, *

14:49.022 --> 14:50.991
* I got this feeling
inside me, *

14:51.024 --> 14:52.492
* I'm going crazy,

14:52.525 --> 14:57.430
* You make me wanna fly,

14:57.464 --> 14:59.166
* You were
right there, *

14:59.199 --> 15:00.167
* Right there

15:00.200 --> 15:01.668
* Right by my side,

15:01.701 --> 15:02.469
* My side,

15:02.502 --> 15:04.938
* You were sweet
and so true, *

15:04.972 --> 15:05.905
* So true,

15:05.939 --> 15:08.341
* I was crushin'
on you, oh, *

15:08.375 --> 15:13.246
* We had it all
what can I say, *

15:13.280 --> 15:15.515
* But it's all over now,

15:15.548 --> 15:19.386
* Boy you don't even
know my name. *

15:22.589 --> 15:24.424
Thanks guys.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.993
You're the best.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.094
(knocking)

15:27.127 --> 15:28.028
Who is it?

15:28.061 --> 15:30.063
Corki! Please, I've
got to talk to you!

15:30.097 --> 15:31.531
Go away, Jared.

15:31.564 --> 15:32.732
You nasty...

15:32.765 --> 15:33.633
bet maker...

15:33.666 --> 15:35.568
Who...

15:35.602 --> 15:37.370
I'm so bad at this!

15:37.404 --> 15:38.605
We'll handle it.

15:38.638 --> 15:42.042
*

15:42.075 --> 15:44.177
I'd tell you
to beat it,

15:44.211 --> 15:46.179
but I don't want to
traumatize your egg.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.248
I'm not leaving
until I talk to her.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.050
Then you'll be
waiting for a while.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.352
'Cause Corki has everything
she needs in that room

15:52.385 --> 15:54.454
and the one thing
she doesn't...

15:54.487 --> 15:56.323
...outside of it.

15:56.356 --> 15:56.990
That's you.

15:57.024 --> 15:57.757
Oh!

15:57.790 --> 16:00.393
*

16:00.427 --> 16:01.294
I know.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.662
*

16:02.695 --> 16:03.730
I can't
believe Jared.

16:03.763 --> 16:04.864
Yeah...

16:04.897 --> 16:06.766
Pretending to be interested
in Corki just to win a bet.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.101
Yep. Totally.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.470
Are you even
listening to me?

16:10.503 --> 16:11.804
Sort of.

16:11.838 --> 16:14.074
But I'm also journaling
about our egg's future.

16:14.107 --> 16:17.077
Do you see piano or
drum lessons as an option?

16:17.110 --> 16:18.845
I'm talking about
Jared and Corki.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.481
I'm just trying to do
what's right for our egg.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.416
It's an egg!

16:23.450 --> 16:25.118
Kids can be
sensitive to tone.

16:25.152 --> 16:25.985
(scoffs)

16:29.922 --> 16:31.158
*

16:31.191 --> 16:35.462
Um, why do you have two cartons
full of "kids" in your backpack?

16:35.495 --> 16:38.631
I, ah, kinda
broke a few...

16:38.665 --> 16:40.633
two dozen of
them actually.

16:40.667 --> 16:41.968
I kept needing
replacements.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.036
Two dozen?

16:43.070 --> 16:44.037
I'm clumsy! And...

16:44.071 --> 16:47.040
I didn't want you to be
disappointed in me.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.875
That's cheating! Ugh!

16:48.908 --> 16:51.411
They must be putting
something in the water here

16:51.444 --> 16:54.013
that turns every guy at
school into a total doofus!

16:54.047 --> 16:56.583
*

16:56.616 --> 16:58.418
You shouldn't have
had to hear that.

16:58.451 --> 16:58.885
(yelps)

17:05.958 --> 17:07.494
Hello, baby.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.861
(lullaby playing)

17:08.895 --> 17:11.931
Please only play the
babies XO-IQ's music.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.067
They'll develop
great taste,

17:14.101 --> 17:17.937
and when you're old enough, you
can be my back-up dancers.

17:17.970 --> 17:22.842
You love to listen, and I have
so many awesome things to say.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.011
I think we're a
pretty good team.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.746
Don't you?

17:26.779 --> 17:28.881
Finally a guy
who gets me.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.984
*

17:32.018 --> 17:34.521
(camera shutter)

17:34.554 --> 17:35.788
Selfie with a boy.

17:35.822 --> 17:36.856
Weird.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.758
Ms. Diona: Attention, please.

17:38.791 --> 17:42.662
I'm disappointed to inform
you of sixteen new casualties.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.965
Seriously-- who brings
eggs to football practice?

17:45.998 --> 17:47.734
See you in the
auditorium shortly.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.604
I think if you aren't
ready to have eggs,

17:51.638 --> 17:53.573
you shouldn't be
in this workshop.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.508
Or the
breakfast line.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.644
Stop avoiding
me, Jared!

17:57.677 --> 17:59.846
Our egg can't
have a deadbeat dad!

18:01.914 --> 18:03.716
Corki! I've been looking
everywhere for you!

18:03.750 --> 18:05.485
We need to talk.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.086
You've done
enough, Jared.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.221
Or not enough.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.990
I can't remember which one
is wrong in this scenario.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.725
She doesn't want
to see you.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.162
I can handle this.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.463
Caleb: Jodi, wait!

18:16.496 --> 18:17.397
I can't trust you.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.966
You passed off a fake
as our egg, what next?

18:19.999 --> 18:22.569
A fake Caleb that does
stuff you don't want to?

18:22.602 --> 18:23.270
Jodi, please!

18:23.303 --> 18:24.837
Can we not just
go back to

18:24.871 --> 18:26.906
the way things were
when we first kissed?

18:26.939 --> 18:30.510
*

18:30.543 --> 18:31.544
You kissed Caleb?

18:31.578 --> 18:32.945
Dude, you should
really think about

18:32.979 --> 18:35.548
what you're going to
say before you say it.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.216
You and Caleb?

18:36.249 --> 18:38.117
You and Jodi?

18:38.151 --> 18:40.153
You can talk?

18:40.187 --> 18:41.087
Caleb: Yeah.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.189
We kissed.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.458
We're... a thing.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.493
Ew.

18:49.196 --> 18:53.166
I'm still mad at you,
you egg-breaking...

18:53.200 --> 18:55.502
Gosh, I'm bad
at this too!!!

18:55.535 --> 18:57.103
Corki, you have
to listen to me.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.771
I'm desperate...

18:58.805 --> 19:01.541
This is a totally
new experience for me!

19:01.574 --> 19:02.074
(sighs)

19:02.108 --> 19:05.678
Leave. Me. Alone.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.214
*

19:07.247 --> 19:08.581
Okay, there
was a bet.

19:08.615 --> 19:11.251
But... I didn't know you
then like I do now.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.619
I really like you.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.587
Somebody's trying to
win the drama award!

19:16.022 --> 19:16.923
What?

19:16.956 --> 19:18.991
There are more important
things than my ego.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.493
You're one of them!

19:20.527 --> 19:22.929
You're sweet and kind--

19:22.962 --> 19:24.931
Sun Hi: And
smart and loyal,

19:24.964 --> 19:30.002
and has the most amazing
and beautiful friend.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.138
What? Corki gets all
this attention,

19:32.171 --> 19:34.207
I can't sneak a little
in for myself?

19:36.409 --> 19:39.279
I wasn't tracking you
down to forgive me.

19:39.312 --> 19:43.049
It was to tell you I
understand if you don't.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.385
What I did was
inexcusable.

19:45.418 --> 19:48.020
Is there anything I can
do to change your mind?

19:48.054 --> 19:51.624
*

19:51.658 --> 19:52.625
(splat!)

19:52.659 --> 19:55.161
*

19:55.194 --> 19:57.029
That helped
a little.

19:57.397 --> 20:00.199
Hey! Don't egg the
father of my egg!

20:00.233 --> 20:01.668
*

20:01.701 --> 20:02.502
(gasps)

20:02.535 --> 20:03.270
(splat!)

20:03.303 --> 20:09.075
*

20:09.108 --> 20:12.044
Valerie Graves, you have been
nothing but horrible to me

20:12.078 --> 20:14.314
and my friends since the
first day of school.

20:14.347 --> 20:19.151
You are vindictive and
manipulative and mean.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.020
(splat!)

20:21.053 --> 20:21.688
(squeals)

20:21.721 --> 20:24.591
*

20:24.624 --> 20:27.059
You can't do
that to me!

20:27.093 --> 20:30.663
She can and she did.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.098
You're forgiven!

20:32.131 --> 20:33.165
*

20:33.199 --> 20:34.100
(squeals)

20:34.133 --> 20:41.007
*

20:41.040 --> 20:42.975
(screaming)

20:43.009 --> 20:45.378
(laughing)

20:45.412 --> 20:52.184
(screaming and laughing)

20:52.218 --> 21:03.296
*

21:05.532 --> 21:07.400
Uh oh.

21:07.434 --> 21:10.169
We'll have this place sparkling
in time for the musical.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.038
Oh, it will be
sparkling,

21:12.071 --> 21:15.408
but as far as I'm
concerned, Oz is history.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.410
The play's in four days.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.312
I mean, where's Stark?

21:19.346 --> 21:21.180
Pursuing his own dreams?

21:21.213 --> 21:23.215
But-- we can
put on the show!

21:23.249 --> 21:25.151
Ms. Diona, everything
will be fine...

21:25.184 --> 21:27.019
We have time.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.155
And it will seem
like even more time

21:29.188 --> 21:31.123
when you're sitting
in detention.

21:31.157 --> 21:32.124
*

21:32.158 --> 21:33.225
Now get to work!
