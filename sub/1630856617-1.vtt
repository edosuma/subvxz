Hey, Jake? Lead the crew

Keep your heads

We don't know what

Hate to ask you this, but...

11:41.500 --> 11:43.069
can you pull some strings,

11:43.135 --> 11:45.671
check and see if Bode's okay
after the earthquake?

11:46.905 --> 11:48.006
Cole, you good?

11:48.074 --> 11:49.241
Yeah.

11:49.308 --> 11:50.376
It's them I'm worried about.

11:51.477 --> 11:52.945
Wife and kids are in Stockton.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.419
Yo, what are you doing?

11:58.317 --> 12:00.419
Checking on my family.

12:00.486 --> 12:01.921
The quake.

12:01.987 --> 12:03.722
It was 6.7.

12:03.789 --> 12:05.958
Epicenter is
right outside your hometown.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.593
Why do you know where I'm from?

12:07.660 --> 12:09.595
Did my due diligence, Leone.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.665
You think I would peacefully
cell up with a snitch?

12:12.731 --> 12:14.433
I heard you took the fall

12:14.500 --> 12:16.202
for something you didn't do
to spring a friend.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.105
Goes a long way
in my book.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.941
(sniffs)
Yeah, well,

12:22.006 --> 12:24.276
Freddy never should have been
locked up to begin with.

12:24.343 --> 12:26.779
And I never should have
been back in my hometown.

You got kids?

No.

12:50.035 --> 12:51.570
Oh.

12:51.636 --> 12:53.606
Ah, the cell circuits
are jammed.

12:53.672 --> 12:55.774
My texts aren't going through.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.510
You're worried about Cara.

12:57.576 --> 12:58.944
Mm-hmm.
Especially Gen.

12:59.011 --> 13:00.479
She must be freaked.

13:00.546 --> 13:04.150
You interested in a tough lesson
from a grizzly former captain?

13:04.216 --> 13:06.018
Ah, you're not too grizzly.

13:06.085 --> 13:08.587
You can't let worry
for your own family

13:08.654 --> 13:10.823
distract you from
saving someone else's.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.826
Or keeping your crew safe
so they can get home to theirs.

13:15.027 --> 13:17.196
It's a lot of
responsibility, my guy.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.669
I'm just grateful
Vince took me in at 42.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.471
I mean, not many stations wanted

13:25.538 --> 13:27.940
the demoted captain who nearly
let drugs ruin Three Rock.

13:28.006 --> 13:29.542
You know?

13:33.179 --> 13:35.114
Manny,
before Bode's false confession

13:35.181 --> 13:36.682
opened the whole thing up again,

13:36.749 --> 13:39.118
you were cleaning up
Three Rock.

13:40.085 --> 13:42.655
Eve's doing one hell of a job,
but...

13:42.721 --> 13:44.690
you would have, too.

13:44.756 --> 13:47.493

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

JAKE: Greencrest,
Engine 1591 on scene

14:02.241 --> 14:03.876
at the Rancho Sequoia
campground.

14:03.943 --> 14:05.910
Road access is
totally blocked.

14:05.977 --> 14:08.179
Greencrest,

14:08.247 --> 14:11.784
Battalion 1508 assuming
Rancho Sequoia I.C.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.953
This road is
completely compromised,

14:14.019 --> 14:15.321
and it's our only way
in or out.

14:15.386 --> 14:16.722
VINCE:
That's what you see.

14:16.789 --> 14:17.723
What do we need, Cap?

14:17.790 --> 14:19.225
All right, listen up.

14:19.291 --> 14:20.392
We're going foot mobile.

14:20.459 --> 14:22.394
Grab water packs
and extinguishers.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.964
I want anyone in there out,
walking or carried.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.233
Collection Point's right
back here, and Greencrest,

14:27.299 --> 14:30.002
we need Three Rock
to come clear this road now.

14:30.069 --> 14:32.438
(siren wailing,
engine revving)

14:36.208 --> 14:37.543
Listen up, Three Rock!

14:37.610 --> 14:40.579
An earthquake and a fire
is worth calling home about.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.915
You follow my orders,
I'll see to it

14:42.982 --> 14:45.384
you get back to camp safe
so you can make those calls.

14:45.451 --> 14:49.255
We got downed trees blocking
access to campground fire.

14:49.321 --> 14:51.624
Fires are named
after where they ignited,

14:51.690 --> 14:53.692

14:53.759 --> 14:55.861
welcome to the Rancho Sequoia.

Help! Help!

Hey.

15:00.532 --> 15:01.934

15:03.335 --> 15:04.270

Please!

15:04.336 --> 15:06.672
Anybody? (crying)

15:07.673 --> 15:10.776
Help! Over here!

15:10.843 --> 15:13.112
Mullie, Robins,
let's get 'em out of there.

15:13.178 --> 15:14.346
Jake, Manny, on the fire.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.781
Copy, Chief.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.383
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

15:17.449 --> 15:18.550
This way.

15:18.617 --> 15:19.785
JAKE:
Greencrest,

15:19.852 --> 15:22.021
we have one
partially involved RV

15:22.087 --> 15:24.290
with a 20 by 20 spot
in the grass,

15:24.356 --> 15:26.191
moderate rate of spread.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.793
WOMAN: Ooh!

15:26.258 --> 15:27.793
VINCE: Tell me.
Tell me what happened.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.928
WOMAN:
(whimpers) Our son!

15:29.995 --> 15:32.131
Our son!

15:29.995 --> 15:32.131
Your son--
Is he still in there? Is...?

15:32.197 --> 15:34.133
Is anybody in there?

15:32.197 --> 15:34.133
No. No. No.

15:34.199 --> 15:35.634
He's at school.

15:35.701 --> 15:38.804
When the earthquake stopped,
I jumped into the driver's seat

15:38.871 --> 15:40.806
to get to my son.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.809
But I didn't realize how bumpy
the roads would be. The-the...

15:43.876 --> 15:46.078
the stove was still on,
and the curtains caught fire.

15:46.145 --> 15:48.247
I need a medic
with an intubation kit at CCP.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.282
You said this started
with a stove fire?

15:50.349 --> 15:51.684
A propane stove?

15:51.750 --> 15:53.118
Yes.

15:53.185 --> 15:55.020
Landon was making
me pancakes.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.424
(indistinct radio chatter)

15:59.925 --> 16:02.828
We got a propane cylinder
inside that box on fire, Jake.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.930
It's surrounded
by dry brush and dead leaves.

16:04.997 --> 16:07.099
VINCE (over radio):
That camper's basically

16:07.166 --> 16:09.802
a bomb covered in tinder
with a lit fuse.

16:10.836 --> 16:13.105
When our only tools are
water packs and extinguishers.

16:13.172 --> 16:14.273
(sighs)

16:14.340 --> 16:15.507
Great.

16:15.574 --> 16:17.643
Let's go, guys!

16:17.710 --> 16:19.211
Knock this down!

16:20.746 --> 16:22.281
(distant chatter and shouting)

16:24.917 --> 16:26.185
You may not have kids,

16:26.251 --> 16:27.419
but I'll be damned
if you don't have a woman,

16:27.486 --> 16:28.921
she writes you
a stack that thick.

16:28.987 --> 16:30.589
What's her name?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.224
Gabriela.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.296
I'm staying in here
for her more than anyone else.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.265
When I was at Three Rock,

16:40.332 --> 16:42.301
we couldn't stay away
from each other.

16:44.269 --> 16:46.372
Sounds like
me and the mother of my kids.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.241
Love of my life.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.810
Well, I don't want
to be the love of hers.

16:51.877 --> 16:53.979
She deserves better.

16:55.881 --> 16:58.717
Our son--
his name's Tommy--

16:58.784 --> 17:01.153
we wrote him an earthquake
letter for school,

17:01.220 --> 17:02.888
in case the big one hits.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.057
Yeah. I've written
a couple of those myself.

17:05.124 --> 17:06.725
WOMAN 2: Hello?
Is someone out there?

17:06.792 --> 17:08.260
We need help, please!

17:08.327 --> 17:10.561
This is Chief Leone.
I'm with Cal Fire.

17:10.629 --> 17:11.730
MAN:
Over here!

17:11.797 --> 17:14.532
If you can walk,
come to the sound of my voice.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.569
If you cannot, just yell out,
We'll come to you.

17:17.636 --> 17:20.406
JAKE:
Chief, I hate to tell you,
but this fire's

17:20.472 --> 17:22.907
eating combustibles faster
than we can contain it.

17:22.975 --> 17:26.011
Look, we stay on this fire,
and this propane cylinder blows,

17:26.078 --> 17:27.746
I'm putting the crew at risk.

17:27.813 --> 17:29.548
But if we switch to defensive,

17:29.615 --> 17:32.084
step back
and brace for the explosion,

17:32.151 --> 17:33.719
the rate of fire spread
will skyrocket.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.587
And we still have
no hose access.

17:35.654 --> 17:37.656
Life first, land next.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.359
You know what call to make.
You just got to make it, Cap.

17:40.426 --> 17:43.028
Copy, Chief. Going defensive.

17:43.095 --> 17:45.196
All right, everybody, get back!

17:45.263 --> 17:46.665
This camper can blow any moment!

17:46.732 --> 17:48.267
Get back! Let's go!

17:48.333 --> 17:50.035
Move! Move!

17:48.333 --> 17:50.035
(overlapping chatter)

17:50.102 --> 17:52.070
Let's go! Get back!

18:02.513 --> 18:03.449
VINCE:
Anybody hurt?

18:03.515 --> 18:05.384
JAKE:
All clear.

18:05.451 --> 18:06.752
Nice call, Cap.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.788
EVE:
Morgan? Morgan?!

18:09.855 --> 18:11.323
Hey, careful with the tension
on the next one.

18:11.390 --> 18:12.791
MANNY:
Hey, where's Beck?

18:12.858 --> 18:14.126
He's a wizard on the blade.

18:14.193 --> 18:15.127
I had to send him
back to prison.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.462
You're kidding me.

18:16.528 --> 18:18.230
Is this some kind
of captain power trip for you?

18:18.297 --> 18:20.965
Sending Beck back to prison
had nothing to do with me.

18:21.032 --> 18:22.634
Yeah, right.

18:21.032 --> 18:22.634
I...

18:22.701 --> 18:24.236
(siren wailing)

18:24.303 --> 18:26.338
(indistinct radio chatter)

18:28.640 --> 18:29.808
All right, the
ambulance has arrived.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.077
Everybody make a path!
Let's go!

18:33.879 --> 18:35.314
All right,
where's our patient?

18:35.380 --> 18:37.648
This way, Perez.

18:37.715 --> 18:39.218
What do we got?

18:39.284 --> 18:40.919
VINCE:
40-year-old male, RV fire.

18:40.986 --> 18:42.921
This patient's priority
for transport.

18:42.988 --> 18:45.257
Perez, start the intubation.

18:45.324 --> 18:48.660
Chief, Bode's safe,
after the earthquake.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.262
My cousin's a C.O.

18:50.329 --> 18:51.830
I knew you'd be worried,
so I made a call.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.565
Thank you, brother.

18:56.167 --> 18:57.603
Let me see.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.443
Circumferential
third-degree burns

19:04.510 --> 19:06.645
to the entire
chest and abdomen.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.146
Let's get him out of the
elements and into the ambo.

19:08.213 --> 19:09.281
Let's go.

19:09.348 --> 19:11.617
(garbled radio transmission)

19:11.683 --> 19:13.285
<i>(lock buzzes, latch clicks)</i>

19:13.352 --> 19:14.619
MAN (over loudspeaker):
Chow.

19:17.689 --> 19:19.725
(indistinct crowd chatter)

19:27.766 --> 19:30.369
(grunting)

19:30.435 --> 19:31.703
This is for Sleeper.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.205
(grunting)

19:33.272 --> 19:35.140
(Bode groans)

19:33.272 --> 19:35.140
GUARD (over loudspeaker):
Fight!

19:35.207 --> 19:37.109
Fold in! Fold in!

19:37.175 --> 19:38.277
(groaning)

19:38.343 --> 19:40.045
(indistinct shouting)

19:40.112 --> 19:42.114
(Bode groans)

19:49.388 --> 19:50.656
Yo, Bode!
You were right behind me.

19:50.722 --> 19:51.924
What the hell happened?

19:50.722 --> 19:51.924
No, no, no, no! No, you--

19:51.990 --> 19:53.759
you don't want them
to see you helping me.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.427
Yeah, it's too late.

19:55.494 --> 19:58.330
(panting)

19:58.397 --> 20:00.098
GABRIELA:
Pulse ox is 67.

20:00.165 --> 20:01.633
His lungs need
some breathing room.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.002
We cut
to release the constriction.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.705
Are you doing an
escharotomy in the field?

20:06.772 --> 20:08.173
No.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.273
You are.

20:09.340 --> 20:10.609
You've practiced this.

20:10.676 --> 20:12.277
On a cadaver.

20:12.344 --> 20:14.346
Nothing prepares you
for your first fire, right?

20:14.413 --> 20:16.181
The only way
to really learn that,

20:16.248 --> 20:18.717
or this, is in the field.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.185
You learned this in the field?

20:20.252 --> 20:21.987
Yeah. Surrounded by gunfire
in Afghanistan.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.821
(rhythmic beeping)

20:23.888 --> 20:26.358
It doesn't have to be pretty,
it just has to save his life.

20:27.326 --> 20:28.859
No pressure.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.700
(rhythmic beeping)

20:34.766 --> 20:38.436
Cut from the clavicle down the
midaxillary line bilaterally.

20:38.503 --> 20:40.806
One, two centimeters deep.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.709
Okay.

20:48.513 --> 20:49.715
Okay.

20:53.619 --> 20:56.154
Now connect the lines
to make an "H."

21:02.127 --> 21:03.328
Okay.

21:05.230 --> 21:07.933
(rhythmic beeping)

21:05.230 --> 21:07.933
Chest is expanding.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.003
Pulse ox
is improving.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.405
It's working.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.407
I did it.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.509
Don't sound so surprised.

21:17.576 --> 21:19.378
I'm not.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.515
(indistinct radio chatter)

21:27.786 --> 21:29.755
Busy day for you,
I imagine,

21:29.821 --> 21:31.423
D.C. Leone.

21:31.490 --> 21:34.359
Well, you know me. Anything
to boss around my big bro.

21:35.494 --> 21:37.029
Look who I caught hitchhiking.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.864
(vehicle door closes)

21:40.666 --> 21:42.034
A kidney and a ride.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.435
I think you're gonna owe me

21:43.502 --> 21:45.369
a really nice
Christmas present this year.

21:46.838 --> 21:48.173
When did you get back?

21:48.240 --> 21:50.208
I wanted to surprise you.

21:50.275 --> 21:51.542
I'm surprised.

21:51.609 --> 21:54.713
Road's clear! Let's go!

21:54.780 --> 21:56.448
All right, here we go.

21:56.515 --> 21:58.183
Let's get these engines moving,
all right?

21:58.250 --> 21:59.384
We got a fire to put out

21:59.451 --> 22:01.086
and a path to do it in finally.
Let's go!

22:02.119 --> 22:03.888
Bet you really wanted
to give that order, didn't you?

22:03.955 --> 22:05.290
No.

22:05.357 --> 22:08.393
I did not. I am not Division
Chief right now. You are.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.096
Well, just interim,
until you're back.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.263
Put me on nozzle.

22:12.330 --> 22:14.465
Your husband is I.C. here,

22:14.532 --> 22:16.368
firefighter, not me.

22:17.569 --> 22:19.471
Yeah, go ahead.

22:19.538 --> 22:21.573
Thank you!

22:21.640 --> 22:24.743
The hospital is overflowing
so I set up triage at 42.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.478
I need you
to run it for me, yeah?

22:26.545 --> 22:28.346
And Vin,

22:28.413 --> 22:30.148
Bode's okay.

22:30.215 --> 22:32.217
There was a few
prison earthquake injuries.

22:32.284 --> 22:33.585
He's wasn't one of 'em.

22:33.652 --> 22:35.821
Yeah, I know. I heard.
Thank you.

22:35.887 --> 22:37.723
Yeah.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.157
Did Sharon even...

22:40.225 --> 22:41.760
even ask about him?

22:46.164 --> 22:47.833
COLE:
Go to the infirmary,
tell the warden

22:47.898 --> 22:50.234
that Sleeper put a hit on you.
It could be your ticket out.

22:50.302 --> 22:52.704
A ticket to what?
Protective Custody yard?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.974
Then I'll really be seen
as a snitch.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.009
(panting)

22:58.076 --> 23:00.412
(straining, groaning)

23:00.479 --> 23:02.881
(panting)

23:02.948 --> 23:05.684
Hey, hand me--
hand me some clean socks.

23:05.751 --> 23:07.285
Here.

23:13.525 --> 23:15.794
(gasping) I...

23:15.861 --> 23:18.163
I need a needle
and thread.

23:42.754 --> 23:43.821
COLE:
Friggin' TikTok.

23:43.888 --> 23:46.157
Everybody thinks
they're a doctor now.

23:47.292 --> 23:49.394
I didn't learn this
on the Internet.

23:49.461 --> 23:51.163
I learned it from my mom.

23:58.637 --> 24:01.173
(grunts)

23:58.637 --> 24:01.173
(indistinct chatter)

24:01.239 --> 24:03.340
I don't know what
I'm more shocked to see,

24:03.407 --> 24:05.042
the engine finally arriving

24:05.109 --> 24:06.845
or Sharon Leone
back in the flesh.

24:06.912 --> 24:08.847
I know, it's like
seeing a ghost, right?

24:08.914 --> 24:12.083
Yeah, yeah, nice
to see you, too.

24:12.150 --> 24:13.518
You can stop
staring now.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.520
You got this fire
to fight.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.422
Where's your chief's helmet?

24:17.489 --> 24:19.657
Where's your captain's helmet?

24:20.759 --> 24:22.694
Looks better on
Jake anyway.

24:22.761 --> 24:24.229
Jake made captain?

24:24.296 --> 24:25.696
Congratulations.

24:25.763 --> 24:27.766
Yeah, yeah.

24:27.833 --> 24:29.701
It's been a big couple of months
since you've been gone.

24:29.768 --> 24:31.536
Yeah, it has.

24:37.175 --> 24:39.444
Um, hi.

24:39.511 --> 24:41.012
You beat me back.

24:41.079 --> 24:42.614
Hi. Uh, fire's out.

24:42.681 --> 24:43.949
I didn't want
to stay for mop-up

24:44.015 --> 24:45.750
'cause I thought
I could be of more use here,

24:45.817 --> 24:47.352
but we're out of 4x4s.

24:55.927 --> 24:56.962
Shar.

24:57.028 --> 24:58.463
Wha...

24:58.530 --> 24:59.931
Y...

24:59.998 --> 25:01.766
You go away for
a couple of weeks

25:01.833 --> 25:03.702
to join the Pine fire,
and I was...

25:03.768 --> 25:05.136
I was happy for you,

25:05.203 --> 25:06.972
taking your
new kidney out

25:07.038 --> 25:08.473
for a test drive.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.475
And you're finally back,

25:10.542 --> 25:13.078
and you want to talk about 4x4s?

25:14.045 --> 25:15.313
There's work to do.

25:15.380 --> 25:16.481
My patient today,

25:16.548 --> 25:17.983
her RV burned to the ground.

25:18.049 --> 25:20.085
Her husband's in the ICU.

25:20.151 --> 25:21.720
All she cares about is her kid.

25:22.888 --> 25:25.590
Tried to drive through an
earthquake to get to him.

25:28.226 --> 25:30.328
Our kid's in prison.

25:30.395 --> 25:32.196
You don't want
to ask how he is?

25:32.263 --> 25:34.833
He's dealing with
the consequences of his actions.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.868
A year ago, you would have
said that was a good thing.

25:36.935 --> 25:40.005
A year ago, you were visiting
him every chance you got.

25:40.071 --> 25:42.140
And how'd that
work out for him, Vince?

25:42.207 --> 25:43.642
I was so enmeshed with our son,

25:43.708 --> 25:45.510
I enabled him
all the way back to prison.

25:45.577 --> 25:47.345
I had to go visit Bode
with Manny.

25:47.412 --> 25:49.013
Not you, Manny.

25:49.080 --> 25:52.617
Had to ask Luke
to check on him for me.

25:52.684 --> 25:54.286
And I haven't slept in months.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.856
I know exactly how you feel.

26:02.093 --> 26:04.529
Well, you were right.

26:04.596 --> 26:06.965
There's work to do.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.440
Hey, you got a minute?

26:19.978 --> 26:22.247
GABRIELA:
Did you see that ER doc's face

26:22.314 --> 26:23.715
when he saw the escharotomy?

26:23.782 --> 26:25.317
He was, like, "Who did this?"

26:25.383 --> 26:27.085
Yeah, I don't think
he liked when I said

26:27.152 --> 26:28.553
medics do
everything doctors do

26:28.619 --> 26:30.555
but without
the egos and BMWs.

26:30.622 --> 26:33.657
Mm-mmm. That made
his forehead vein angry.

26:33.725 --> 26:36.261
Chief, put us to work.

26:36.328 --> 26:37.595
The sooner
I complete my hours,

26:37.662 --> 26:38.596
the sooner I become

26:38.663 --> 26:39.965
a certified
medic firefighter.

26:40.031 --> 26:42.200
Right, and the sooner
you're back at 42

26:42.267 --> 26:43.635
where you belong, full time.

26:43.702 --> 26:46.171
DIEGO:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Chief.
58 has an ambulance.

26:46.237 --> 26:47.405
Do you have an ambulance?

26:47.472 --> 26:50.842
Well, 42 has "Leone mud," so...

26:50.909 --> 26:52.510
(laughs)

26:50.909 --> 26:52.510
For now,
go ahead.

26:52.577 --> 26:55.046
Take 30. You earned it.

26:52.577 --> 26:55.046
Okay.

26:57.482 --> 26:59.517
LUKE:
Yeah, copy that. Keep me posted.

27:02.387 --> 27:04.556
You know, typically,
when the division chief

27:04.622 --> 27:07.258
invites you out for drinks
to celebrate making captain,

27:07.325 --> 27:08.593
you say yes.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.263
Okay? Or at least
get back to him.

27:12.330 --> 27:13.865
Beginning to think
you didn't like me.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.467
No, no, it's not that, Chief.

27:15.532 --> 27:16.935
I'm just...

27:17.002 --> 27:18.903
It's just a little hard
to accept congrats for a job

27:18.970 --> 27:20.438
I got because
my friend got demoted

27:20.505 --> 27:22.107
and my other friend
is in prison, so...

27:22.173 --> 27:23.407
Feels kind of dirty, huh?

27:23.475 --> 27:24.476
A little bit.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.476
Yeah.

27:24.542 --> 27:25.777
Manny always thought

27:25.844 --> 27:27.145
I was gunning for his job,

27:27.212 --> 27:28.446
and now
I have it.

27:28.513 --> 27:29.881
Yeah, well,
I was openly campaigning

27:29.948 --> 27:31.383
for Sharon's job
and now I have it.

27:31.449 --> 27:32.751
Although giving her a kidney

27:32.817 --> 27:33.952
definitely helped
with the guilt.

27:34.019 --> 27:35.754
You could try that.

27:36.955 --> 27:39.290
The way we got
here sucked.

27:39.357 --> 27:40.458
But that doesn't mean
we can't do some good

27:40.525 --> 27:41.593
while we're here, right?

27:44.095 --> 27:46.196
Cheers.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.201
(indistinct conversations)

27:50.268 --> 27:51.369
We just
gave a man

27:51.436 --> 27:53.304
the ability to
breathe again, Diego.

27:53.371 --> 27:54.472
It never gets old,

27:54.539 --> 27:56.808
giving people a chance
at another day,

27:56.875 --> 27:59.644
to tell their kids
they love them,

27:59.711 --> 28:02.113
to pop the question,

28:02.180 --> 28:05.383
to do whatever it is they've
been putting off because...

28:05.450 --> 28:07.484
everyone thinks
they'll live forever.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.893
You know,
ever since we met...

28:16.428 --> 28:18.596
...I'm all about
living in the now.

28:18.663 --> 28:19.763
Come here.

28:28.273 --> 28:30.708
Happy four-month anniversary.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.578
Happy anniversary.

28:42.253 --> 28:43.788
Things with Bode are bad.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.690
How bad?

28:45.757 --> 28:48.159
What if telling him
he's a father today

28:48.226 --> 28:50.128
is the difference
between life and death?

28:53.364 --> 28:56.034
Cara, I was Gen's age
when my dad died.

28:56.101 --> 28:58.203
What if Bode
is her father?

28:58.269 --> 29:00.371
I mean...

29:00.438 --> 29:02.540
shouldn't she at least

29:02.607 --> 29:05.877
get the option to know him
before it's too late?

29:07.212 --> 29:09.481
Hey, baby, listen,
I-I don't want to push you.

29:09.547 --> 29:11.216
I don't, but...

29:11.282 --> 29:14.119
today, as soon as possible,

29:14.185 --> 29:16.154
might be our last window
to save him.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.996
I'll use this one right here
to hit Sleeper's boy.

29:25.063 --> 29:26.931
This one's
for Sleeper.

29:26.998 --> 29:28.299
It's got to
be tonight.

29:37.308 --> 29:39.344
Vivienne.

29:39.410 --> 29:41.346
That was
my mom's name.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.414
What happened?

29:43.481 --> 29:45.583
She died.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.185
Heart attack.

29:49.254 --> 29:52.090
But if you
ask my Pops,

29:52.157 --> 29:55.160
she died of
a broken heart over me.

29:57.162 --> 29:58.696
Can't imagine.

29:58.763 --> 30:00.698
You might be about to live it.

30:04.669 --> 30:06.771
Your, uh, your phone.

30:06.838 --> 30:08.206
Can I make a call?

30:10.975 --> 30:12.944
Lucky for you,

30:45.610 --> 30:46.878

at fire camp.

to promise me that

30:48.313 --> 30:50.215

my parents when I'm gone.

30:50.281 --> 30:52.116
Bode, you have
a life here in Edgewater.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.285

for one call...

30:54.352 --> 30:56.387

30:54.352 --> 30:56.387
BODE: ...and I called you.

30:56.454 --> 30:58.056

What's going on?

31:04.195 --> 31:05.230

Let me talk to him.

31:05.296 --> 31:06.331
Hold on.

31:07.932 --> 31:09.901

to captain the crew.

42:42.293 --> 42:44.495
