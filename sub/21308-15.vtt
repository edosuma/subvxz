WEBVTT

00:48.855 --> 00:50.275
Attention, Quest Buy shoppers,

00:50.275 --> 00:52.235
Quest Buy is proud to host

00:52.235 --> 00:54.615
Quest Buy's 10,000th annual

00:54.615 --> 00:57.235
Squire Blowout, or whatever.

00:57.235 --> 01:00.195
Marco, this is gonna be
so much fun!

01:00.195 --> 01:01.985
Just a squire and his knight

01:01.985 --> 01:05.855
shopping, pop-locking,
shop-locking.

01:05.855 --> 01:07.235
You know,
you feel me, bro.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.775
I know that looked like it hurt.

01:08.775 --> 01:11.355
Oh, it did,
but I'll feel better

01:11.355 --> 01:13.945
as soon as we find
this little beauty

01:13.945 --> 01:16.155
from the Quest Buy catalog.

01:16.155 --> 01:17.615
I've always wanted one!

01:17.615 --> 01:20.815
Sorry, Star, but that's
not on the list.

01:20.815 --> 01:25.115
Boom!

01:25.115 --> 01:27.275
BABY-MAN:
Wow, that's so organized.

01:27.275 --> 01:30.485
Look, it's got coupons
attached to it.

01:30.485 --> 01:31.695
I like a coupon.

01:31.695 --> 01:33.905
Hey, guys.

01:33.905 --> 01:36.445
Oh, hey, man.
I dig your list.

01:36.445 --> 01:38.905
Thanks.
It's every sale item
of the Squire Blowout

01:38.905 --> 01:40.905
grouped together
by aisle and availability.

01:40.905 --> 01:42.855
I called ahead to check
the inventory on each item.

01:42.855 --> 01:44.115
That's cool.

01:44.115 --> 01:46.235
A great squire is
an organized squire.

01:46.235 --> 01:47.315
That's what I always say.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.565
Uh, great.

01:49.565 --> 01:51.355
Squire!

01:51.355 --> 01:53.065
I'm Higgs.
That's Baby-Man.

01:53.065 --> 01:54.815
- Hey!
- And the old guy

01:54.815 --> 01:56.525
- is Old Guy.
- I'm old!

01:56.525 --> 01:57.525
- I'm M--
- He's Marco.

01:57.525 --> 01:59.115
This is his first blowout.

01:59.115 --> 02:01.525
Really? Huh.
I would've thought
you a veteran

02:01.525 --> 02:02.695
with that fancy
list of yours.

02:02.695 --> 02:04.855
Nope.
I don't know anything at all.

02:04.855 --> 02:05.905
Heh, nice.

02:05.905 --> 02:08.315
Well, welcome to the
community, Marco.

02:08.315 --> 02:10.615
- I'm honored.
- I'm honored.

02:10.615 --> 02:12.815
Oh, uh, just a little
squire to squire advice,

02:12.815 --> 02:14.905
equipping your knight
and making them look good

02:14.905 --> 02:16.735
is gonna be your
most important task.

02:16.735 --> 02:18.735
So you wanna get to
the good stuff fast.

02:18.735 --> 02:20.155
The shelves
clear out quickly.

02:20.155 --> 02:21.565
I plan on it.

02:21.565 --> 02:23.445
So, where are
y'alls knights at?

02:23.445 --> 02:24.905
Oh, they're over there.

02:24.905 --> 02:27.775
That's Lady Whosits.
Baby-Man's knight.

02:30.775 --> 02:35.065
And Old Man's knight,
Sir Dashing of Muzzleton.

02:37.695 --> 02:38.775
Call me.

02:38.775 --> 02:40.615
And this is my knight,

02:40.615 --> 02:42.195
Sir Stabby.

02:43.945 --> 02:46.775
Higgs, I am in need
of a wet wipe.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.905
Oh, cool.

02:48.905 --> 02:51.355
Duty calls.
See you at the starting line.

02:51.355 --> 02:53.565
- Nerd.
- Okay.

02:53.565 --> 02:55.855
Did she just
call me a nerd?

02:55.855 --> 02:57.235
No.

02:57.235 --> 03:00.855
Endearing nerd
or something.

03:00.855 --> 03:02.025
You know.
I don't know.

03:02.025 --> 03:05.485
Come on,
let's get a cart.

03:05.485 --> 03:08.275
My lady, choose your steed.

03:08.275 --> 03:14.275
No. No.
Oh, in your dreams.

03:14.275 --> 03:17.275
Giddy up, horsey!

03:17.275 --> 03:18.775
Whee!

03:18.775 --> 03:20.155
All right, here we go, boy!

03:20.155 --> 03:21.615
Hi-ho, rainbow!

03:23.195 --> 03:26.695
Attention, Quest Buy shoppers,

03:26.695 --> 03:29.655
the 10,000th annual
Squire Blowout

03:29.655 --> 03:33.775
is starting in... now minutes.

03:33.775 --> 03:35.905
- Go!

03:35.905 --> 03:37.235
Go, go, go!

03:37.235 --> 03:38.235
Marco, giddy up!

03:38.235 --> 03:39.565
- Whee!
- Aah!

03:39.565 --> 03:43.275
Marco, I think
something's wrong

03:43.275 --> 03:45.065
with the wheels!

03:45.065 --> 03:47.485
Whoa! Ah.

03:48.485 --> 03:50.985
Here's my bolt, losers!

03:50.985 --> 03:52.985
Thanks for the head start!

03:52.985 --> 03:54.815
What?

03:54.815 --> 03:56.985
That old guy
sabotaged our cart.

03:56.985 --> 03:59.855
They're gonna get
all the good items before us!

03:59.855 --> 04:02.695
Marco, it's all good.

04:02.695 --> 04:03.905
We'll get the good stuff.

04:03.905 --> 04:05.155
Let's just try to have fun.

04:07.985 --> 04:10.655
See, fun!
Now, let's go!

04:10.655 --> 04:13.445
I am buying everything!

04:13.445 --> 04:14.735
Whoo-hoo!

04:14.735 --> 04:16.065
Okay, what is
item number one?

04:16.065 --> 04:17.855
Item number one is,
uh, a chest plate.

04:17.855 --> 04:19.275
We need a chest plate.

04:19.275 --> 04:20.445
It's on aisle
eight point nine.

04:20.445 --> 04:21.655
Eight point nine,
got it.

04:21.655 --> 04:23.525
Yee-haw!

04:25.155 --> 04:26.525
Got mine!

04:26.525 --> 04:30.065
I got mine.

04:30.065 --> 04:31.905
I goo-goo got mine.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.485
Hey, there's one left.

04:33.485 --> 04:35.485
Almost forgot.

04:35.485 --> 04:37.905
Have fun wearing my face.

04:37.905 --> 04:39.485
Ha ha!

04:39.485 --> 04:42.315
That Baby-Man ruined
the last chest plate.

04:42.315 --> 04:44.905
I knew those squires
were up to something.

04:44.905 --> 04:47.115
They don't want me
to have the good stuff.

04:47.115 --> 04:49.905
- Marco, I don't--
- Yes, I see it now.

04:49.905 --> 04:51.235
I think you're making them out--

04:51.235 --> 04:53.525
I've got it!
We'll outsmart them.

04:53.525 --> 04:55.275
We'll just go out of order.

04:55.275 --> 04:56.735
That way we can get ahead.

04:56.735 --> 04:58.155
Marco, chill.

04:58.155 --> 05:00.565
I don't even wear chest plates.

05:00.565 --> 05:02.855
I just wanna
salvage my plan, that's all.

05:02.855 --> 05:06.275
A great squire
is an organized squire.

05:10.525 --> 05:13.735
Yes! We've beat
the other squires to it.

05:13.735 --> 05:15.945
I want that one!

05:17.115 --> 05:18.905
Uh, oh, uh.

05:18.905 --> 05:22.065
Actually, Star, I did
the research on these guys,

05:22.065 --> 05:23.735
and it came down to these two.

05:23.735 --> 05:25.065
They each ranked highest
in their class

05:25.065 --> 05:27.485
on safety, growth rate,
a knight horse power.

05:27.485 --> 05:29.025
This one comes with an airbag.

05:29.025 --> 05:30.275
So either of these
should be good.

05:30.275 --> 05:32.355
Oh, okay.

05:32.355 --> 05:35.695
Well, I guess the airbag one.

05:35.695 --> 05:37.905
- Good choice.

05:39.735 --> 05:41.525
Okay, since we're right near
the dragon repellant,

05:41.525 --> 05:42.985
I think we should--

05:47.445 --> 05:49.155
Hey, that's our
starter horse!

05:49.155 --> 05:51.195
What?
I didn't take your horse.

05:51.195 --> 05:54.155
I just saw you take it.
Now give it back.

05:54.155 --> 05:57.115
Higgs, did you take
their starter horse?

05:57.115 --> 05:59.155
No, siree.
Unh-unh.

05:59.155 --> 06:02.025
Are you calling my squire
a liar?

06:02.025 --> 06:04.735
Uh, yes?

06:04.735 --> 06:06.695
If you're calling
my squire a liar...

06:06.695 --> 06:09.775
- Oh, whoa!
- Then you're calling me a liar!

06:09.775 --> 06:11.905
Ugh, whatever, stabby dude.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.115
Take the horse.
We don't need it.

06:13.115 --> 06:17.155
Very well.

06:19.945 --> 06:20.985
Can you believe her?

06:20.985 --> 06:22.485
It's all right, Marco.

06:22.485 --> 06:25.065
I'll just pick out
another... one.

06:25.065 --> 06:28.655
Ha ha!
Peace!

06:28.655 --> 06:30.195
Are you serious?

06:30.195 --> 06:32.355
It's okay, Marco.

06:32.355 --> 06:34.775
Listen, let's just
get back to your list.

06:34.775 --> 06:35.905
Look, look, look, look, look.

06:35.905 --> 06:37.065
There's the dragon repellant.

06:37.065 --> 06:38.615
We need that, right?

06:38.615 --> 06:40.695
Yeah.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.065
Ugh, yep,
that's the stuff.

06:47.065 --> 06:48.485
HIGGS:
Yoo-hoo!

06:51.155 --> 06:54.445
- Oh, no.

06:54.445 --> 06:56.615
( dragons growling,
Marco screaming )

06:56.615 --> 06:58.985
Apparently, we've got dragons

06:58.985 --> 07:03.235
on aisle 14.2... again.

07:03.235 --> 07:06.155
Shoo. Shoo.

07:06.155 --> 07:08.275
This is not my department.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.655
Uh, please get off.

07:16.065 --> 07:17.355
Uh, whoopsie.

07:17.355 --> 07:18.815
Did you mean to get this one?

07:18.815 --> 07:22.815
Easy mistake.
They look so similar.

07:24.565 --> 07:27.235
You wanna tell me why
you're being such a jerk?

07:27.235 --> 07:30.445
Listen, wannabe, you think
it's easy being a squire?

07:30.445 --> 07:34.275
All of my waking hours
I'm weaving chain mail,
sharpening swords.

07:34.275 --> 07:36.025
I'm always at my knight's
beck and call.

07:36.025 --> 07:39.025
I've even learned how to
polish armor in my sleep.

07:39.025 --> 07:41.025
But what did you do
to earn this job?

07:41.025 --> 07:43.445
Oh, nothing.
It was handed to you

07:43.445 --> 07:45.315
because you're the
princess' boyfriend.

07:45.315 --> 07:47.525
What? I'm not her boyfriend.

07:47.525 --> 07:49.155
Interesting.

07:49.155 --> 07:52.775
Guess it was handed to you
out of pity, then, huh?

07:52.775 --> 07:54.565
Star!

07:54.565 --> 07:56.985
- Marco!
- I'm here, Star.

07:56.985 --> 07:58.905
- Under the dragon butt.
- Oh.

07:58.905 --> 08:01.065
Scram, lizard.
Sk-Sk-Skidaddle!

08:01.065 --> 08:03.945
Well, I think
that's enough fun
for one squire.

08:03.945 --> 08:05.525
What say we call it
a day, Marco?

08:05.525 --> 08:07.065
The sale's almost over,
anyway.

08:07.065 --> 08:10.235
No! There's still
one thing left
on my list, Star.

08:10.235 --> 08:12.815
Armor wax.
There's just one bottle left.

08:12.815 --> 08:14.275
I called ahead to check.

08:14.275 --> 08:16.655
We have to get it
before those other squires.

08:16.655 --> 08:18.405
Uh, Marco, no offense,

08:18.405 --> 08:20.115
but you're looking
kinda sweaty.

08:20.115 --> 08:21.615
Like sweatier than usual.

08:21.615 --> 08:23.155
Hey, maybe let's just,
you know--

08:23.155 --> 08:25.775
- Mount the cart!
- Okay!

08:31.445 --> 08:32.445
Don't let them get that!

08:42.025 --> 08:44.195
Marco!

08:44.195 --> 08:46.485
Aah!
Oh, that's it!

08:46.485 --> 08:48.115
Aah!

08:48.115 --> 08:50.235
Aah!

08:55.355 --> 08:57.905
Yes!

09:00.405 --> 09:03.155
- Marco!

09:05.195 --> 09:07.905
Oh, I didn't trip her
that hard.

09:07.905 --> 09:10.155
What? She's faking it.

09:10.155 --> 09:12.195
Here.

09:12.195 --> 09:13.525
Ha, ha-ha!

09:13.525 --> 09:15.315
Thanks for the wax, losers!

09:15.315 --> 09:16.735
Let's check out.

09:16.735 --> 09:20.615
Dude, you have
got to chill.

09:20.615 --> 09:22.195
What

09:22.195 --> 09:24.735
I'm just trying to get you
the best stuff.

09:27.195 --> 09:29.275
I'm sorry.

09:29.275 --> 09:31.115
I just really wanted
to show everyone

09:31.115 --> 09:33.695
that I was truly worthy
of being your squire.

09:33.695 --> 09:36.315
But maybe I'm not
cut out for this.

09:36.315 --> 09:39.315
Why did you appoint me
as your squire
in the first place?

09:39.315 --> 09:40.775
I'm terrible at it.

09:40.775 --> 09:41.945
I didn't get you any gear,

09:41.945 --> 09:43.525
and you're gonna
look like a joke

09:43.525 --> 09:45.275
in front of all
the other knights.

09:48.695 --> 09:51.235
Okay, first of all,
I am a princess.

09:51.235 --> 09:53.235
So I'm gonna look great
no matter what.

09:53.235 --> 09:56.315
Second, I knew how excited you
were about coming back to Mewni

09:56.315 --> 09:58.115
so I bent the rules a little.

09:58.115 --> 10:00.155
I'm a princess,
not a knight.

10:00.155 --> 10:02.195
I don't need the stuff
actual knights need.

10:02.195 --> 10:04.155
I've got, like,
a magic wand.

10:04.155 --> 10:06.025
The whole point
of making you my squire

10:06.025 --> 10:07.235
was so we could
hang out again

10:07.235 --> 10:08.735
and just do silly stuff.

10:08.735 --> 10:11.355
Attention, Quest Buy shoppers,

10:11.355 --> 10:12.985
only one minute remains

10:12.985 --> 10:15.985
in this year's
Squire Blowout sale.

10:15.985 --> 10:17.695
All right, come on.

10:17.695 --> 10:19.315
Huh? But wait, wait, wait.

10:19.315 --> 10:21.275
Marco, I just told you
I don't need the--

10:21.275 --> 10:22.525
I know, I know.

10:22.525 --> 10:24.195
Come on.

10:25.235 --> 10:29.855
Got you this
really shiny shield.

10:29.855 --> 10:31.855
Not shiny enough.

10:34.405 --> 10:38.195
It's beautiful!

10:38.195 --> 10:41.315
Hey, Marco, I challenge you
to a duel...

10:41.315 --> 10:43.275
A duel of silliness!

10:43.275 --> 10:45.405
I accept your challenge!

10:49.525 --> 10:51.065
Hey, what do they think
they're doing?
