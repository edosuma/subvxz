WEBVTT

00:24.894 --> 00:28.158
[light dramatic music]

00:46.959 --> 00:49.049
- [David] Abby, why?

00:49.136 --> 00:51.877
Speak to me, Abby, why
are you doing this to me?

00:51.964 --> 00:54.445
What do you want from me?

00:54.532 --> 00:55.359
Abby!

00:56.708 --> 00:59.233
- [Woman] David, David, David.

01:00.364 --> 01:03.367
[branches crunching]

01:12.550 --> 01:14.248
- You want me?

01:14.335 --> 01:15.727
Come and get me!

01:15.814 --> 01:18.513
[dramatic music]

01:54.766 --> 01:58.466
- [Man] What if we knew
that was God was real?

02:01.860 --> 02:03.688
[door creaking]

02:03.775 --> 02:06.343
[bat thudding]

02:10.652 --> 02:15.439
[light music]
[Abby laughing]

02:40.856 --> 02:43.380
- [Man] Wake up, David.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.643
It's time to get moving.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.123
- [Woman] David.

02:53.434 --> 02:56.088
- [David] Abby, I dreamt
about you again last night.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.744
It's day 75 and I'm no
closer to figuring out

02:59.831 --> 03:01.703
what happened to you.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.662
They continue to point their
finger at me and say I did it,

03:04.749 --> 03:08.318
and with Charlie missing, I
can't convince them otherwise.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.407
It's easy for them
to blame me, though.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.366
It makes sense.

03:12.453 --> 03:15.630
They say you two were having
an affair, but this is a lie.

03:15.717 --> 03:16.544
It has to be.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.026
They don't know me,

03:22.506 --> 03:24.116
and they certainly
don't know you.

03:32.124 --> 03:34.605
As they press me and I
deal with their antics,

03:34.692 --> 03:37.260
attempts to break me
and force me to crack,

03:37.347 --> 03:40.002
I rely on my abilities to
put the pieces together

03:40.089 --> 03:41.003
and figure it out.

03:43.745 --> 03:46.704
There are moments though,
where I see myself falling into

03:46.791 --> 03:49.794
a dark abyss so deep, that
eventually it will be impossible

03:49.881 --> 03:53.581
to find my way back,
and as the light fades,

03:53.668 --> 03:55.539
I feel the darkness consume me.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.283
[radio chiming]

04:00.370 --> 04:03.765
- [Announcer] Conspiracy Radio.

04:03.852 --> 04:06.158
- [Jimmy] Let me
get this straight,

04:06.246 --> 04:09.988
the Devil is very much alive
and he's living amongst us?

04:11.468 --> 04:12.948
- [Perez] Well, that
depends on your perspective.

04:13.035 --> 04:15.646
- [Jimmy] Oh that's
such a crock, though.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.258
I mean don't you think, I
mean this spiritual battle,

04:18.345 --> 04:22.087
a fight between good
and evil, God, Creation.

04:22.174 --> 04:24.829
Don't you think that this
is just a ploy against us

04:24.916 --> 04:26.657
that's set up by
organized religion?

04:26.744 --> 04:28.964
- [Perez] I'm not about
organized religion.

04:29.051 --> 04:32.707
Um, I am completely about
something different, Mr. Jones.

04:32.794 --> 04:36.406
- [Jimmy] Anyway, well first
off, Jimmy, just call me Jimmy.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.016
And also I hope
I didn't come off

04:38.103 --> 04:39.757
like I was antagonizing you.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.106
I am just really
curious about this

04:41.193 --> 04:42.630
fight between good and evil,

04:42.717 --> 04:44.371
and it seems very
black and white to me.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.243
- [Perez] No, what you or
I cannot deny that there

04:47.330 --> 04:49.506
is good and evil in this world.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.901
There is light and
there is darkness.

04:52.988 --> 04:56.774
In between, there
is nothing else.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.298
It's either or.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.212
We as a human race
continue to ignore this

05:00.300 --> 05:04.086
and have convinced
ourselves of this gray area,

05:05.609 --> 05:07.481
but that's not the truth.

05:07.568 --> 05:09.221
- [Jimmy] Well that
was very well said

05:09.309 --> 05:12.660
and I might have a point
to counteract with that.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.488
Let's take a quick
break and listen

05:14.575 --> 05:17.621
to a phenomenal
band Old Man Canyon.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.669
- [David] Perez is right.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.279
There is no gray area.

05:23.366 --> 05:25.281
There only is or isn't.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.762
What we do and what we don't do.

05:27.849 --> 05:30.112
Take Detective
Parks for instance.

05:30.199 --> 05:33.724
He sits there and watches
me day after day after day,

05:33.811 --> 05:36.248
like he's expecting
me to slip up.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.599
Maybe if I was guilty I would.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.994
The only thing I am guilty
of is not telling you

05:43.081 --> 05:45.214
every day how much I love you.

05:45.301 --> 05:48.043
Guilty of not doing
enough to keep you safe.

05:51.742 --> 05:54.266
Believe me, I'm doing
everything I can

05:54.354 --> 05:58.836
to prove my innocence, but
each day has its challenges.

05:58.923 --> 06:01.448
While the detectives spend
their time playing mind games

06:01.535 --> 06:03.885
and hoping that
eventually I'll break,

06:03.972 --> 06:07.018
I spend my time investigating
the university's involvement.

06:20.554 --> 06:23.905
Say for a moment that you and
Charlie were having an affair.

06:23.992 --> 06:26.560
I don't know if I
would resort to murder.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.083
I have never lifted my hand

06:28.170 --> 06:30.738
to another human
being my entire life.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.696
I don't think I'm
capable of violence.

06:33.915 --> 06:35.351
I have witnessed
enough death in my time

06:35.438 --> 06:37.788
to know that nothing
is solved by it.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.312
- And you didn't know if
anyone was comin' to visit?

06:42.706 --> 06:44.055
How do you think this looks?

06:47.581 --> 06:48.625
Are you admitting it?

06:51.106 --> 06:52.150
- Parks, take a walk.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.721
- You went fishing, right?

06:58.896 --> 06:59.723
You catch anything?

07:01.638 --> 07:04.336
[Parks chuckling]

07:06.643 --> 07:08.819
- Mr. Harris, my
partner's just trying

07:08.906 --> 07:10.821
to put together the pieces.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.302
You say you come back,
there was a broken mug.

07:13.389 --> 07:14.869
The chair is flipped
over and your wife

07:14.956 --> 07:16.871
is no where to be seen.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.525
So you go out looking for her,

07:18.612 --> 07:20.918
yet you don't call us
for a number of hours.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.793
Now given what you
do for a living,

07:25.880 --> 07:27.447
how do you think that sounds?

07:27.534 --> 07:31.059
- I get it, things happen,
people fall in love,

07:31.146 --> 07:32.843
especially when they
work as close together

07:32.930 --> 07:34.236
like you and Charlie did.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.935
Suggesting you and
Charlie having an affair

07:38.022 --> 07:42.592
is too convenient, too obvious
and not to mention cliche.

07:42.679 --> 07:45.726
But I wonder if people knew
how different you both were.

07:45.813 --> 07:48.076
Sure, maybe you believed
in the same things;

07:48.163 --> 07:50.948
helping others, making a
difference in the world,

07:51.035 --> 07:53.255
not to mention
your faith in God.

07:53.342 --> 07:56.650
And even though you wanted
to accomplish the same thing,

07:56.737 --> 07:58.173
you didn't always
see eye to eye.

07:58.260 --> 07:59.217
[phone buzzing]

07:59.304 --> 08:01.872
[muffled music]

08:08.879 --> 08:10.141
Hello, Dad.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.448
- [Henry] Hi, son.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.058
You got me on that
speaker again?

08:15.451 --> 08:17.061
How many times do
I have to tell you?

08:17.148 --> 08:18.236
They may be listening.

08:21.936 --> 08:22.806
- What do you want?

08:24.068 --> 08:25.809
- I wanna know how
you're doing today.

08:28.420 --> 08:29.726
- Just wanted to welcome
- You feel like company?

08:29.813 --> 08:30.901
- [Jimmy] Everyone
back to the program.

08:30.988 --> 08:32.686
- Do I have a choice?

08:32.773 --> 08:34.252
- Of course you do.
- Or if you're just tuning in

08:34.339 --> 08:35.732
we are here with renowned

08:35.819 --> 08:37.212
- Come on.
- Author and Harvard professor

08:37.299 --> 08:38.909
Perez Valentino.
- Your mom made brownies.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.955
- [Jimmy] In his five part
series on his new book--

08:41.042 --> 08:44.741
- So I don't have a choice.

08:44.828 --> 08:47.091
As you wish.
- This is about faith.

08:47.178 --> 08:51.269
And I'm really curious about
- Great, see you in an hour.

08:51.356 --> 08:53.968
- [Jimmy] Your opinion
of the afterlife.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.538
- [Perez] I think the essence
of our faith, is love.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.584
I think where we
[light somber music]

09:01.671 --> 09:03.499
fall of the rails is
linked to our faith

09:03.586 --> 09:05.588
and money and material objects;

09:05.675 --> 09:10.593
shoes, cars, televisions,
television devices, T.V. shows,

09:13.074 --> 09:17.513
news, propaganda, and we
get away from our movies--

09:17.600 --> 09:19.123
- [David] Detective Parks
and Gaines are not paying

09:19.210 --> 09:21.473
close enough attention
to the university

09:21.561 --> 09:23.954
and their involvement
in your death.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.783
They have to know more
than they're letting on.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.350
- [Perez] We, whose
fact of authorities.

09:28.437 --> 09:29.960
- [David] Whatever you
two were working on

09:30.047 --> 09:32.397
caused you to keep
secrets from me.

09:32.484 --> 09:33.877
What was so important
that you felt

09:33.964 --> 09:35.879
that you had to hide it from me?

09:35.966 --> 09:38.012
That you felt you
couldn't say something?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.103
You don't think I noticed how
on edge you were at times?

09:42.190 --> 09:43.887
Something must have
happened between you

09:43.974 --> 09:46.673
and the board of directors
that made you nervous enough

09:46.760 --> 09:48.979
that you felt you
couldn't talk to me.

09:49.066 --> 09:52.330
If you couldn't trust me,
then who could you trust?

09:53.549 --> 09:55.072
- [Perez] Intuition.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.944
- Hey, I got a package
for a David Harris.

09:58.075 --> 10:01.383
- [Perez] Fly south for
the winter to make warm.

10:01.470 --> 10:05.343
How do they know to fly south
rather than stay, intuition.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.737
It's something that
humans have inside of them

10:08.956 --> 10:09.565
that we've had and
continually had since

10:11.915 --> 10:13.003
the beginning of
time, since existence.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.920
[doorbell ringing]

10:17.007 --> 10:21.098
We deny that fact of the
thing that all tribunes

10:21.185 --> 10:25.363
that modern living has in
the heat of the furnace.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.324
- [Henry] You gotta eat.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.588
- [David] Come on in.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.329
- I wanna whip up
something special,

10:34.416 --> 10:36.723
you wanna invite your
friend in and feed him too?

10:36.810 --> 10:37.593
- Let him starve.

10:39.813 --> 10:40.901
- That's not very nice.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.904
- [Jimmy] Convert you.

10:43.991 --> 10:47.081
[muffled radio talking]

10:51.433 --> 10:52.260
- How'd you sleep?

10:54.262 --> 10:56.612
- [David] I don't sleep.

10:56.699 --> 11:00.964
- Your mom sends her
love and brownies.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.185
- How is she doin'?

11:04.272 --> 11:06.013
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.318
- Your mom's a survivor.

11:10.539 --> 11:11.975
She's not who I'm worried about.

11:19.156 --> 11:20.723
You kids need a father, David.

11:23.073 --> 11:24.248
They're not doin' too good.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.599
This has gone on too long.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.992
You need to do something.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.300
- [David] What?

11:32.387 --> 11:34.215
- Do you think I'm
just gonna stand around

11:34.302 --> 11:36.043
and watch you throw
your life away?

11:36.130 --> 11:37.871
That's not gonna happen, bud.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.399
- [David] Tell 'em I love 'em.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.444
- You tell 'em.

11:47.794 --> 11:48.664
That's your job.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.014
That's your sole purpose.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.026
- They're comin' for me, dad.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.813
It's just a matter of
time, but they're comin'.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.209
- I know, Martin
called me this morning.

12:12.296 --> 12:14.037
[David chuckling]

12:14.124 --> 12:15.560
- Is that why you're here?

12:20.130 --> 12:21.044
- Yes and no.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.832
Okay, mostly yes.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.792
But I thought maybe we
could work on this together.

12:29.879 --> 12:30.837
Get it figured out.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.143
We know we don't have much time.

12:35.189 --> 12:37.800
Have you been able to
make any kind of progress?

12:37.887 --> 12:39.193
- None.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.978
I mean, my mind's
not workin' right.

12:43.284 --> 12:44.764
I can't think straight.

12:46.069 --> 12:49.290
I mean, I try, I try to
put the pieces together,

12:49.377 --> 12:50.552
but they don't seem to fit.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.079
Maybe they're right.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.256
- What are you saying?

13:00.997 --> 13:01.737
David.

13:02.782 --> 13:03.957
- Maybe it's that simple?

13:06.263 --> 13:08.178
Maybe they were
having an affair.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.659
- Don't you dare.
- What!

13:10.746 --> 13:12.095
It makes sense, doesn't it?

13:13.314 --> 13:15.403
The secret meetings?

13:15.490 --> 13:16.708
Coming home late at night?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.623
- Enough!

13:18.710 --> 13:21.801
I'm not gonna stand here and
watch you go down that road.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.759
You know what it's like
when you're working

13:23.846 --> 13:25.630
on something that's important.

13:27.415 --> 13:29.460
Abby was a good woman.

13:29.547 --> 13:32.333
Abby was a great wife.

13:32.420 --> 13:35.858
Don't you dare, not
even for a moment,

13:35.945 --> 13:38.426
allow anyone to
sully her reputation.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.780
- What am I gonna do?

13:44.867 --> 13:47.914
[light dramatic music]

13:48.001 --> 13:49.654
- I don't know.

13:49.741 --> 13:52.701
Maybe start at the end,
work your way backwards.

13:52.788 --> 13:57.271
- I've done that over
and over and over again.

13:59.273 --> 14:02.232
- David, you're a bright man,

14:02.319 --> 14:04.539
but you're also very sensitive.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.196
You can't allow your emotions

14:09.283 --> 14:11.763
to control your thought process.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.898
It's like you almost
have to stand outside

14:15.985 --> 14:18.161
of the circumstance
that you're in,

14:18.248 --> 14:22.513
in order to see a bigger,
more global picture.

14:25.952 --> 14:26.735
- I have been.

14:28.302 --> 14:31.305
That's what I don't
think you understand.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.219
I have.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.885
- How do you like your eggs?

14:48.626 --> 14:52.326
We're not gonna be able to
solve this on an empty stomach.

14:56.634 --> 14:59.289
- Scrambled, like my brains.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.210
- But I wanna stay with you.

15:08.516 --> 15:12.215
- [David] Oh, sweetie,
I know, but you can't.

15:14.348 --> 15:15.915
- But you need me,
I can help you.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.918
- [David] Look, I know
that it seems that way,

15:19.005 --> 15:21.094
but daddy just needs to
be alone right now, okay?

15:23.400 --> 15:24.227
Okay?

15:27.404 --> 15:29.798
- [Henry] What, you're
not gonna finish that?

15:29.885 --> 15:30.668
- No, I'm good.

15:32.105 --> 15:33.454
- Well, you hardly touched it.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.673
Come on, you need to eat.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.257
[light dramatic music]

16:01.656 --> 16:02.526
- Charlie.

16:05.007 --> 16:08.576
He had a brilliant mind and
he had this ability to see

16:08.663 --> 16:11.840
things from a different
perspective, beyond science.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.800
There was something
special about him.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.543
He had all these theories
on life's creation.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.502
He told me he wanted
to scientifically

16:21.589 --> 16:23.721
prove that God was real.

16:23.808 --> 16:26.550
Said it would end all
war, can you believe it?

16:26.637 --> 16:27.551
- You gotta go.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.468
- Hm, what?

16:31.555 --> 16:33.949
- [David] Lock the
door on your way out.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.298
- What, David?

16:40.477 --> 16:43.002
[door slamming]

16:45.656 --> 16:48.703
- If Charlie's alive
and gone into hiding,

16:48.790 --> 16:51.097
then I'm gonna need some
help to draw him out.

16:57.625 --> 16:58.495
You hungry?

17:06.242 --> 17:08.810
Come on, let me make
you something to eat.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.467
Why aren't you guys
looking for Charlie?

17:13.554 --> 17:14.511
- Oh, we are.

17:14.598 --> 17:15.904
Around the clock.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.342
Where did you hide the body?

17:23.477 --> 17:25.174
[David chuckling]

17:25.261 --> 17:26.828
- Oh, you guys
don't quit, do you?

17:28.395 --> 17:29.526
I didn't kill my wife.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.050
I didn't kill Charlie.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.442
- Keep tellin' yourself that.

17:34.662 --> 17:39.580
- You know, your insults,
they're not gonna work on me.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.451
- Ah, that's right,
you know the game.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.066
- [David] So why aren't
you looking for him?

17:48.676 --> 17:51.244
- Mr. Harris--
- David, call me David.

17:52.593 --> 17:56.423
- Mr. Harris, I'm not
here to be your friend.

17:56.510 --> 17:57.424
I'm here in pursuit
of the truth.

17:57.511 --> 17:58.425
- [David] Me, too.

17:58.512 --> 18:01.384
[Parks groaning]

18:02.385 --> 18:03.125
All right.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.128
I'll talk, you listen.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.526
So we know that Abby
and Charlie were working

18:12.613 --> 18:14.702
on something groundbreaking
for the university.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.705
- We looked into that.

18:17.792 --> 18:22.013
- [David] I know, but it
must have been so big that

18:22.927 --> 18:24.190
the university got scared

18:24.277 --> 18:25.408
and they needed to
put a lid on it.

18:26.322 --> 18:28.019
- Go on.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.674
- [David] See, if we could,
if we could find out what

18:30.761 --> 18:32.633
it was they discovered,
then we could figure out

18:32.720 --> 18:35.592
who killed Abby, who
really killed her

18:35.679 --> 18:37.507
and we can draw
Charlie out of hiding.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.859
- Yeah, Gaines
warned me about you.

18:43.034 --> 18:45.036
Said you were too smart
for your own good.

18:47.082 --> 18:50.259
We talked to everyone we
needed to at the university.

18:50.346 --> 18:53.175
They said Charlie quit, they
have his resignation letter

18:53.262 --> 18:55.351
so you can toss that
theory right out the door--

18:55.438 --> 18:57.005
- [David] They're lying.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.833
Anyone can fabricate a letter.

18:59.747 --> 19:01.357
You know that.

19:01.444 --> 19:03.925
- You've been cooped up
in here way too long.

19:04.012 --> 19:05.274
Hasn't done you any good.

19:07.537 --> 19:09.409
- Its given me time;

19:09.496 --> 19:12.194
time to think and put
the pieces together.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.631
I'm on to something here,
and you need to go back

19:14.718 --> 19:16.851
to the university and
you need to look harder.

19:16.938 --> 19:20.550
- Mr. Harris, you're
starting to panic

19:20.637 --> 19:22.726
because you realize the
truth is about to come out.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.294
So all of this, I get.

19:27.557 --> 19:30.865
- [David] If Charlie's
dead, then where's his body?

19:30.952 --> 19:32.736
- I don't know, you tell me.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.303
- [David] I don't know!

19:34.390 --> 19:36.087
- I don't believe you.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.525
You read a lot of
conspiracy books.

19:38.612 --> 19:39.526
I've even caught that
station you listen

19:39.613 --> 19:41.180
to when I've come in here.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.790
- [David] It's on just
for background noise.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.705
- Yeah, right, but you've
been here a long time,

19:44.792 --> 19:47.490
and that doesn't do someone
in your condition any good.

19:52.756 --> 19:53.670
It's sad.

19:55.716 --> 19:56.978
I think a psychologist
would call this

19:57.065 --> 19:58.458
post traumatic syndrome.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.722
You know, a lot of
the vets coming back

20:01.809 --> 20:03.071
from the war have it.

20:04.725 --> 20:07.380
'Cause killing someone is
not an easy thing to do.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.035
Killing two, that
must be even harder.

20:14.909 --> 20:19.870
[fist thudding]
[suspenseful music]

20:38.628 --> 20:41.240
[dramatic music]

20:57.778 --> 20:58.474
- Abby?

21:25.849 --> 21:26.633
Abby?

21:38.122 --> 21:40.995
[muffled whispers]

21:51.875 --> 21:53.007
Abby?

21:53.094 --> 21:53.834
Abby?

21:57.185 --> 21:58.621
Abby, wait.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.075
- [Gaines] Parks, you there?

22:18.162 --> 22:20.426
If you're there, Parks, pick up.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.645
Hey, Parks, I got
coffee, pick up.

22:22.732 --> 22:23.690
We're still waiting
on the warrant,

22:23.777 --> 22:26.040
so do not go inside.

22:26.127 --> 22:29.086
[suspenseful music]

22:48.410 --> 22:50.194
- [Parks] Yeah,
you're in for it now.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.372
What are you gonna do, run?

22:58.855 --> 23:02.685
- You try explaining this
one to your superiors.

23:09.257 --> 23:11.955
[dramatic music]

23:24.533 --> 23:27.667
[door slamming]

23:27.754 --> 23:31.714
[knocking on door]
- Mr. Harris.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.064
Mr. Harris, open the door.

23:37.328 --> 23:40.549
[tapping on glass]

23:40.636 --> 23:42.943
Come on, let's talk.

23:43.030 --> 23:46.816
Hey, where's Parks?

23:46.903 --> 23:49.515
Open the door, Mr. Harris.

23:49.602 --> 23:54.520
Can you open the door?
[dramatic music]

24:01.875 --> 24:04.181
- Hey, he went
out the back door!

24:24.941 --> 24:25.681
- Mr. Harris.

24:27.857 --> 24:28.902
Get off the fence.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.294
Get down.

24:30.381 --> 24:31.252
Get off the fence.

24:32.383 --> 24:34.298
David, get down, come on.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.475
David, don't run.

24:36.562 --> 24:37.345
David.

25:08.245 --> 25:09.072
- He took my gun.

25:10.683 --> 25:11.466
- Seriously?

25:14.295 --> 25:15.296
[key clanging]

25:15.383 --> 25:16.340
What the hell happened?

25:19.953 --> 25:21.781
- I didn't think
he had it in him.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.219
- Well apparently, he
did, what'd you say?

25:29.136 --> 25:29.919
Jeez, let me do that.

25:31.051 --> 25:31.834
- I'm right handed.

25:34.968 --> 25:36.099
- Yeah, we'll call it in.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.146
Here, leave that on.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.161
- Hi, Mr. Harris.
- Hi.

25:54.248 --> 25:55.945
- It's good to see you.

25:56.032 --> 25:57.817
- You too.

25:57.904 --> 25:58.948
- Tea, water?

25:59.035 --> 25:59.862
- Uh.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.473
- Sorry to hear about your wife.

26:04.127 --> 26:05.564
- Thanks.

26:05.651 --> 26:06.956
- Do you want a menu?

26:07.043 --> 26:08.784
- I'm okay right now.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.133
Do you have a phone I can use?

26:10.220 --> 26:11.570
- Yeah, come with me.
- Okay.

26:24.844 --> 26:28.761
Ah, 555-525-5151.

26:34.201 --> 26:34.941
[dramatic music]

26:35.028 --> 26:36.464
What have I done?

26:36.551 --> 26:38.074
This is not good.

26:38.161 --> 26:39.685
I can't believe I hit him.

26:39.772 --> 26:44.690
And you, you're, I saw
your lifeless body.

26:45.952 --> 26:46.909
They found you at the
bottom of a ravine.

26:48.041 --> 26:49.129
Dead people aren't
supposed to appear

26:49.216 --> 26:50.521
in front of you like that,

26:51.435 --> 26:52.915
they're supposed to stay dead.

26:54.177 --> 26:55.352
What's happening to me?

26:55.439 --> 26:57.833
[phone ringing]

26:57.920 --> 26:58.921
- [Melissa] Harris,
Carter, and McGill,

26:59.008 --> 27:00.096
how can I direct your call?

27:00.183 --> 27:01.707
- Yeah, Martin Carter, please.

27:03.796 --> 27:05.711
- Uh, Mr. Carter is with
some clients right now.

27:05.798 --> 27:07.800
- Melissa, it's me, David.

27:08.844 --> 27:09.976
I need to talk to him.

27:10.063 --> 27:11.020
- Oh, my God, David.

27:11.107 --> 27:12.195
Are you okay?

27:12.282 --> 27:13.022
Stay on the line.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.944
[sighs]

27:29.691 --> 27:32.259
[phone ringing]

27:37.351 --> 27:39.353
- David, where the hell are you?

27:40.702 --> 27:41.921
- I can't say.

27:42.008 --> 27:43.400
- Of course you can.

27:43.487 --> 27:45.054
Tell me where you are,
I'll come get you.

27:45.141 --> 27:48.231
- No, Martin, no.

27:48.318 --> 27:49.102
- David.

27:50.799 --> 27:52.192
David, this isn't
how we do things.

27:52.279 --> 27:53.149
You know that.

27:53.236 --> 27:54.324
- I saw her, Martin.

27:54.411 --> 27:55.151
- [Martin] You saw who, David?

27:55.238 --> 27:56.022
- I saw Abby.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.072
- All right.

28:05.248 --> 28:05.988
All right, buddy.

28:08.643 --> 28:09.426
Let me help you.

28:12.908 --> 28:13.996
Now tell me where you are.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.829
[dial tone buzzing]

28:26.356 --> 28:29.403
[phone beeping]

28:29.490 --> 28:30.404
Henry, it's Martin.

28:31.666 --> 28:33.015
We have a problem.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.759
[door slamming]

28:37.846 --> 28:38.804
- [Man] Two, please.

28:40.240 --> 28:43.025
- [David] Those
two, who are they?

28:43.112 --> 28:46.942
They aren't FBI
or CIA or the mob.

28:47.029 --> 28:50.119
That pin, they're
with the school.

28:50.206 --> 28:51.773
That's it.

28:51.860 --> 28:54.471
They're sending people
after me, aren't they?

28:54.558 --> 28:56.560
And I can't believe
I told Martin.

28:56.647 --> 28:58.301
That wasn't very smart.

28:58.388 --> 29:01.043
He's crazy if he thinks
I'm gonna turn myself in.

29:03.219 --> 29:04.525
- [Man] What's he doing?

29:04.612 --> 29:05.787
- Writing, he's writing.

29:07.571 --> 29:08.877
- [Man] Anything else?

29:08.964 --> 29:10.357
- [David] I have
to watch myself.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.185
Every move I make
has to be calculated.

29:12.272 --> 29:14.187
- [Man] Nobody else is with him?

29:14.274 --> 29:15.057
- By himself.

29:15.144 --> 29:16.667
Single plate.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.278
- [David] What kinda
trouble were you in, Abby?

29:18.365 --> 29:19.627
What do they want with me?

29:19.714 --> 29:21.455
- Would you like a refill?

29:21.542 --> 29:23.936
Are you sure you don't
want a second cup?

29:24.023 --> 29:24.763
It's free.

29:27.113 --> 29:29.115
[giggling]

29:36.165 --> 29:37.123
[snapping]

29:37.210 --> 29:37.950
- Mr. Harris?

29:39.473 --> 29:41.257
Mr. Harris?

29:41.344 --> 29:43.825
You zoned out
there for a second.

29:43.912 --> 29:45.305
You okay?

29:45.392 --> 29:47.089
You sure you don't
want something to eat?

29:47.176 --> 29:51.528
Mr. Harris, Mr. Harris.
[suspenseful music]

29:58.884 --> 30:02.104
[light dramatic music]

30:31.568 --> 30:33.179
- [Henry] Chloe, come on inside.

30:33.266 --> 30:35.094
It's time to eat.

30:35.181 --> 30:36.922
Come on in, let's
get washed up, hon.

30:45.104 --> 30:47.541
[somber music]

31:17.397 --> 31:18.137
- Abby?

31:30.149 --> 31:30.889
Abby?

33:04.547 --> 33:07.072
[David sighing]

My wife is dead,

All I have to do is
prove my innocence.

50:34.509 --> 50:36.685

me no other choice.
