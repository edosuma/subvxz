00:55.848 --> 00:57.558
Thank you.

(burping): You're welcome.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.103
(laughing)

01:02.145 --> 01:03.146
Hal.

01:03.188 --> 01:06.107
(burping):

01:03.188 --> 01:06.107
All right, boys, that's enough.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.067
(laughing)

(breaking wind)

01:10.863 --> 01:12.197
(all laughing)

01:12.239 --> 01:13.615
Do you think for once

01:13.657 --> 01:16.117
we could have a civilized

01:13.657 --> 01:16.117
conversation during dinner,

01:16.159 --> 01:18.161
free of sound effects?

01:18.203 --> 01:20.748
Your mother's right. I don't

01:18.203 --> 01:20.748
think it's asking too much

01:20.789 --> 01:22.624
for us to have some

01:20.789 --> 01:22.624
nice dinner conversation.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.423
Malcolm, how was school today?

01:29.464 --> 01:31.008
History class was cool.

01:31.050 --> 01:32.217
Really? Tell us about it.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.552
Jimmy Perkins

01:32.259 --> 01:33.552
kicked the crap

01:33.594 --> 01:36.137
out of Fred Nason right

01:33.594 --> 01:36.137
outside our window.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.806
REESE: He beat up Fred Nason?

01:36.179 --> 01:37.806
That dude's huge.

01:37.848 --> 01:38.933
I know! I couldn't

01:37.848 --> 01:38.933
believe it.

01:38.974 --> 01:39.975
Fred knocked Jimmy's hat off,

01:40.017 --> 01:41.643
and Jimmy turned and

01:40.017 --> 01:41.643
punched him in the face,

01:41.685 --> 01:43.144
like, five times in a row

01:41.685 --> 01:43.144
in, like, a second.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.064
Fred fell in the bush

01:43.186 --> 01:45.064
and then he just started

01:45.146 --> 01:46.147
hitting him and hitting

01:45.146 --> 01:46.147
him and hitting him.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.357
It was awesome.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.150
Jimmy Perkins is crazy.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.819
It's like I've always

01:49.192 --> 01:50.819
told you boys--

01:50.861 --> 01:52.153
crazy beats big every time.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.155
(breaking wind)

01:54.197 --> 01:57.409
(laughing)

01:57.451 --> 01:58.577
(laughter stops)

02:03.665 --> 02:08.169
So, how was your day, dear?

02:08.211 --> 02:09.254
Hey, Eric, it's Francis.

02:09.296 --> 02:10.255
How's Alaska?

02:10.297 --> 02:11.590
Francis, where are you?

02:11.632 --> 02:14.051
You were supposed to be here

02:11.632 --> 02:14.051
two weeks ago.

02:14.093 --> 02:15.385
I know, but no one

02:14.093 --> 02:15.385
will pick me up.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.805
I ran out of money and had to

02:15.427 --> 02:17.805
work tarring roofs for a week.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.180
Apparently there's

02:17.846 --> 02:19.180
a serial killer

02:19.222 --> 02:20.599
loose in Idaho

02:19.222 --> 02:20.599
who looks just like me.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.017
You'd better get here soon.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.685
I don't know how much longer

02:22.059 --> 02:23.685
they'll hold the job.

02:23.727 --> 02:24.853
I'm almost there.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.188
Listen, do I take

02:24.895 --> 02:27.188
the Provincial Highway 99

02:27.230 --> 02:29.608
or do I take the 27

02:27.230 --> 02:29.608
to Provincial Highway 12?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.026
What? Where are you?

02:31.068 --> 02:32.193
I'm close to British Columbia.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.278
I'm in Bellingham, Washington.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.864
Francis, you're still

02:33.320 --> 02:35.864
2,000 miles away.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.825
What? No way.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.825
I got to be near Alaska.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.452
I just exchanged all my money

02:37.866 --> 02:40.452
for Alaskan dollars.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.204
There's no such thing

02:40.494 --> 02:43.204
as Alaskan dollars.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.248
Sir!

02:47.501 --> 02:49.920
Are you almost

02:47.501 --> 02:49.920
finished with that?

02:49.962 --> 02:52.213
What have you got in mind?

02:52.255 --> 02:55.050
I need you to watch the boys

02:52.255 --> 02:55.050
next Tuesday night.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.426
I've joined a book club.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.219
Oh, Lois,

02:56.468 --> 02:58.219
you don't want to do that.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.222
I joined a record club once,

02:58.261 --> 03:01.222
and they hounded me for years.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.850
It's not that

03:01.264 --> 03:02.850
kind of a club, Hal.

03:02.891 --> 03:06.812
This is women from school--

03:02.891 --> 03:06.812
adults-- discussing books.

03:06.854 --> 03:07.646
Oh.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.897
I live in a house

03:08.939 --> 03:10.107
filled with boys.

03:10.149 --> 03:10.941
I listen to boy talk

03:10.983 --> 03:12.026
and boy noises.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.485
I need to spend some time

03:12.067 --> 03:13.485
with females.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.486
Mm-hmm.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.446
Whenever I see them

03:14.528 --> 03:16.446
at the PTA meetings,

03:16.488 --> 03:19.658
they always invite me to do

03:16.488 --> 03:19.658
things with them and I never go.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.617
Mm-hmm, yeah.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.244
I need to do this for my sanity.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.873
Yeah.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.873
Hee-hee-hee-hee, yes.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.500
Yeah.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.500
Are you even

03:25.914 --> 03:28.500
listening to me?

03:28.542 --> 03:30.127
Of course I am.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.294
Here's what I think:

03:31.336 --> 03:33.463
this book club is

03:31.336 --> 03:33.463
a great idea, Lois.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.757
It's about time you did

03:33.505 --> 03:35.757
something like this.

03:35.799 --> 03:38.426
You have a brilliant

03:35.799 --> 03:38.426
and beautiful mind

03:38.468 --> 03:39.678
that needs challenging.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.723
I just hope those other

03:39.720 --> 03:42.723
women can keep up with you.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.767
Now, make a wish.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.272
Okay, I left the phone number

03:49.312 --> 03:51.272
on the counter.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.900
The dishes are soaking

03:51.314 --> 03:52.900
in the sink.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.526
I took the batteries

03:52.941 --> 03:54.526
out of the remote

03:54.568 --> 03:56.277
and I put them

03:54.568 --> 03:56.277
in the smoke detector--

03:56.319 --> 03:57.487
just for tonight.

03:57.529 --> 03:58.780
Would you relax, honey?

03:58.822 --> 03:59.948
You're off the clock.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.117
This is supposed to

03:59.990 --> 04:02.117
be your night out.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.326
Just enjoy yourself, huh?

04:03.368 --> 04:04.285
Stop worrying.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.285
Yeah, Mom.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.285
Have fun.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.121
Oh, oh, oh.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.122
Uh, remember to take

04:07.164 --> 04:08.916
the garbage cans

04:07.164 --> 04:08.916
to the curb tonight.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.333
Would you please

04:08.957 --> 04:10.333
stop worrying?

04:10.375 --> 04:11.501
Just go have some fun.

04:11.543 --> 04:12.544
Now?

04:12.586 --> 04:16.965
No. Let's let Mom

04:12.586 --> 04:16.965
get a few blocks away.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.383
Right. This could

04:17.007 --> 04:18.383
be a trick.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.301
What are you guys

04:18.425 --> 04:20.301
talking about?

04:20.343 --> 04:22.596
We've got some fireworks

04:20.343 --> 04:22.596
buried in the backyard.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.806
We're going to dig them up

04:22.637 --> 04:24.806
while Mom's gone.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.307
Tracy Hines is having a party

04:26.349 --> 04:27.893
tomorrow night and

04:26.349 --> 04:27.893
we're not invited.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.729
Our justice will be swift

04:27.935 --> 04:30.729
but fair.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.022
We'll be fine!

04:32.064 --> 04:34.357
Okay, I don't want

04:32.064 --> 04:34.357
to screw this up.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.317
Lois needs time to herself.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.112
She deserves a night out.

04:38.153 --> 04:41.698
She'll have a great time

04:38.153 --> 04:41.698
and then come home all happy.

04:41.740 --> 04:45.244
I just have to somehow

04:41.740 --> 04:45.244
keep the boys under control.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.328
Oh, what am I talking about?

04:45.285 --> 04:47.328
They're good kids.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.330
What am I talking about

04:47.370 --> 04:49.330
"what am I talking about"?

04:49.372 --> 04:51.374
They're monsters!

04:51.416 --> 04:53.710
They'll destroy everything

04:51.416 --> 04:53.710
and then ruin Lois's night,

04:53.752 --> 04:57.172
and then, then she'll feel

04:53.752 --> 04:57.172
like we can't be trusted

04:53.752 --> 04:57.172
on our own.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.424
She'll never want to have

04:57.214 --> 04:59.424
a night out again,

04:59.466 --> 05:01.218
and it will all be my fault!

05:01.260 --> 05:03.344
We're going out back.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.638
You're not going anywhere.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.140
You're going to stay

05:06.181 --> 05:08.349
in your room all night

05:06.181 --> 05:08.349
with the door shut! Now go!

05:08.391 --> 05:10.351
Go!

05:12.395 --> 05:14.940
Mmm. This cheddar is wonderful.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.024
It is good.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.359
So, I really

05:16.066 --> 05:18.359
liked the book.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.778
Really?

05:19.820 --> 05:22.322
Oh, Karen, let's have

05:19.820 --> 05:22.322
some more of that wine.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.533
I like the way

05:24.241 --> 05:25.533
the author shifted

05:25.575 --> 05:27.452
the voice of the narrator

05:25.575 --> 05:27.452
from character to character.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.288
Oh...

05:29.329 --> 05:31.999
well, I'll just have to

05:29.329 --> 05:31.999
take your word on that.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.875
I didn't really read the book.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.252
Oh.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.838
Was anyone else confused

05:35.294 --> 05:37.838
by those flashbacks?

05:40.841 --> 05:43.802
Am I the only one

05:40.841 --> 05:43.802
who read the book?

05:43.844 --> 05:48.598
Actually, Lois, we don't make it

05:43.844 --> 05:48.598
mandatory to read the book.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.391
What?

05:48.640 --> 05:50.391
I mean, we're all busy.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.811
But that shouldn't

05:50.433 --> 05:52.811
prevent us

05:52.853 --> 05:54.896
from enjoying a

05:52.853 --> 05:54.896
relaxing evening

05:54.938 --> 05:56.982
every once in a while.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.818
Lois, don't you feel you deserve

05:59.860 --> 06:02.612
one night away

05:59.860 --> 06:02.612
from the bickering,

06:02.654 --> 06:05.115
the yelling

06:02.654 --> 06:05.115
and the TV blaring?

06:05.157 --> 06:06.407
Away from all

06:06.449 --> 06:08.409
the stupid little problems

06:08.451 --> 06:12.039
that can't seem to be solved

06:08.451 --> 06:12.039
without you?

06:15.334 --> 06:17.044
Little more.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.725
Oh, thank you.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.352
Thank you for stopping.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.103
Oh, glad to.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.103
My name's Roy.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.064
I'm Francis.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.064
God, it's freezing out there.

06:37.105 --> 06:40.108
I've been standing in that same

06:37.105 --> 06:40.108
stretch of road for six hours.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.944
People were actually flipping

06:40.150 --> 06:42.944
me off as they drove past me.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.821
Why would they do that?

06:44.863 --> 06:46.823
So, how far you going?

06:46.865 --> 06:48.116
Mamu.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.243
I'm going up to Green River.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.535
I can take you almost

06:49.284 --> 06:50.535
the whole way.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.162
Oh, my God, really?

06:52.204 --> 06:55.874
It's taken me the last

06:52.204 --> 06:55.874
three days to get 20 miles.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.458
(choking up):

06:55.916 --> 06:57.458
Thank you.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.501
You okay?

06:58.543 --> 07:00.712
Yeah. It's just...

07:00.754 --> 07:03.131
people aren't very nice.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.465
You want some coffee?

07:04.507 --> 07:07.094
Yes.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.512
And when I was leaving,

07:09.554 --> 07:12.099
my mom and I are yelling

07:09.554 --> 07:12.099
and screaming at each other

07:12.140 --> 07:14.642
and she's still finding

07:12.140 --> 07:14.642
the time to tell the cab driver

07:14.684 --> 07:16.477
which route to take

07:14.684 --> 07:16.477
to the bus station.

07:16.519 --> 07:17.938
She's a total control freak.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.189
She sounds like

07:17.979 --> 07:19.189
she's afraid.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.108
What would my mom

07:19.231 --> 07:21.108
have to be afraid of?

07:21.149 --> 07:22.650
Well, she could be afraid

07:22.692 --> 07:24.986
that if she doesn't control

07:22.692 --> 07:24.986
every aspect of her life

07:25.028 --> 07:27.114
or the lives of the

07:25.028 --> 07:27.114
people she cares about,

07:27.155 --> 07:28.698
that horrible things

07:27.155 --> 07:28.698
will happen.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.367
Like what horrible things?

07:30.409 --> 07:31.910
Well, maybe her oldest son

07:31.952 --> 07:33.954
moving 5,000 miles

07:31.952 --> 07:33.954
away from her?

07:33.995 --> 07:36.206
All right, you got me there.

07:36.248 --> 07:37.791
You're pretty smart.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.960
Well, I'm on the road

07:37.832 --> 07:39.960
18 hours a day.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.503
Gives me a lot of time

07:40.001 --> 07:42.503
to think about things,

07:42.545 --> 07:45.299
about people, why they

07:42.545 --> 07:45.299
do the things they do.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.426
I'm kind of a wannabe

07:45.340 --> 07:47.426
psychiatrist.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.386
Well, I'm just glad

07:47.467 --> 07:49.386
to finally be out of it.

07:49.428 --> 07:51.179
I got a line

07:49.428 --> 07:51.179
that I'm not going to cross

07:51.221 --> 07:53.598
and if anyone tries to push me

07:51.221 --> 07:53.598
across it, I'm gone.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.599
Well, sure,

07:54.641 --> 07:56.559
everybody's got a line.

07:56.601 --> 07:59.520
But what's interesting is,

07:56.601 --> 07:59.520
everyone's line is different.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.563
Sometimes it moves.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.108
I mean, look at your

08:00.605 --> 08:03.108
situation right here.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.527
It is freezing cold, there's

08:03.150 --> 08:06.527
no other cars on the road.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.988
Hypothetically, if I said

08:08.029 --> 08:09.530
"Put on a curly, red wig

08:09.572 --> 08:11.532
or I'll throw you

08:09.572 --> 08:11.532
out of the truck,"

08:11.574 --> 08:14.535
are you really going to go

08:11.574 --> 08:14.535
back out into the cold?

08:14.577 --> 08:16.037
Yeah, but that's ridiculous.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.498
You can't use a silly example

08:16.079 --> 08:18.498
like that to prove...

08:19.791 --> 08:21.418
You're kidding.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.089
Okay, okay.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.929
You haven't made a sound

08:30.885 --> 08:32.929
in a half an hour!

08:32.971 --> 08:34.264
What's going on in here?

08:34.306 --> 08:36.016
Nothing.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.016
I expect perfect behavior

08:36.057 --> 08:37.558
out of you boys tonight.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.561
Trust me, if you try anything--

08:37.600 --> 08:40.561
anything at all--

08:40.603 --> 08:44.316
I will be on you like

08:40.603 --> 08:44.316
a rainbow on an oil slick!

08:48.611 --> 08:51.823
Okay, this is good.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.658
You sent them a message.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.161
Fired a shot across their bow.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.579
Now they know who's in charge.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.831
Maybe I was too harsh.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.208
If the boys push back,

09:01.249 --> 09:03.584
they might do something

09:01.249 --> 09:03.584
ten times worse

09:03.626 --> 09:05.379
and spoil everything for Lois.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.588
Don't go soft.

09:07.630 --> 09:11.634
All these boys understand

09:07.630 --> 09:11.634
is the iron fist.

09:11.676 --> 09:15.096
No. I need to get them

09:11.676 --> 09:15.096
on my side.

09:15.138 --> 09:18.599
Dewey, you be lookout

09:15.138 --> 09:18.599
while we dig up the fireworks.

09:18.641 --> 09:19.893
What's going on with Dad?

09:19.934 --> 09:21.061
I don't know.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.188
Maybe he's dealing

09:21.102 --> 09:23.188
with something at work.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.647
I hope he's

09:23.230 --> 09:24.647
going to be okay.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.607
At his age, carrying around

09:24.689 --> 09:26.607
that kind of tension

09:26.649 --> 09:27.608
can't be good for you.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.444
Whoa! Dad's here.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.572
Who wants ice cream?

09:33.948 --> 09:37.618
So, I come home

09:33.948 --> 09:37.618
after working a ten-hour shift

09:37.660 --> 09:38.870
and I see my boys,

09:38.912 --> 09:40.621
and they're

09:38.912 --> 09:40.621
covered with grass

09:40.663 --> 09:42.874
and they're covered with

09:40.663 --> 09:42.874
paint, and they look at me

09:42.916 --> 09:45.001
and you know what

09:42.916 --> 09:45.001
all they can say is?

09:45.043 --> 09:46.711
"Where's dinner?"

09:46.753 --> 09:47.628
Oh, yeah.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.713
Oh, yeah.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.507
Too much is

09:48.755 --> 09:50.507
expected of us.

09:50.549 --> 09:53.427
Well, our society

09:50.549 --> 09:53.427
is just so screwed up.

09:53.468 --> 09:57.097
30 years ago, you could just

09:53.468 --> 09:57.097
at least pick something

09:57.138 --> 09:58.223
and go with it.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.641
A housewife,

09:58.265 --> 10:00.641
a career woman, sex slave.

10:00.683 --> 10:04.645
But now you're supposed to do

10:00.683 --> 10:04.645
everything, and it's impossible!

10:04.687 --> 10:07.023
Unless you're

10:04.687 --> 10:07.023
Lillian Miller.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.066
Oh, yeah.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.650
You know, if it

10:08.108 --> 10:09.650
weren't for me,

10:09.692 --> 10:10.818
my family would be naked,

10:10.860 --> 10:12.571
living in trees,

10:10.860 --> 10:12.571
eating berries.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.115
I mean, do they appreciate

10:12.612 --> 10:15.115
what I do for them? No!

10:15.156 --> 10:16.324
No.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.451
Lillian Miller's family

10:17.492 --> 10:19.369
just surprised her

10:17.492 --> 10:19.369
with a trip to Spain.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.370
Really? No kidding.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.662
You know, the other day

10:21.704 --> 10:23.498
I discovered a two-

10:21.704 --> 10:23.498
inch long hair

10:23.540 --> 10:24.832
growing out of my shoulder.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.834
I mean, how long

10:24.874 --> 10:26.834
has that been there?

10:26.876 --> 10:30.171
I don't even have time

10:26.876 --> 10:30.171
to put myself together

10:26.876 --> 10:30.171
in the morning.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.672
Lillian Miller...

10:31.714 --> 10:36.136
brought 20 homemade cakes

10:31.714 --> 10:36.136
to the school bake sale.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.679
I had those.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.349
They were delicious.

10:41.391 --> 10:46.313
The woman just cooks like a god,

10:41.391 --> 10:46.313
but she never puts on a pound.

10:46.354 --> 10:50.066
You can't be 45

10:46.354 --> 10:50.066
and still be a size two.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.693
That's children sizes.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.693
That's for children!

10:52.735 --> 10:53.694
And Lillian!

10:53.736 --> 10:54.695
Yeah.

10:54.737 --> 10:55.614
You know, ladies,

10:55.655 --> 10:57.365
I just realized something.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.742
Society isn't the thing

10:57.407 --> 10:59.742
that's making us miserable.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.578
I mean, hell, we're society.

11:01.620 --> 11:02.703
Uh-huh, yeah.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.414
No, no.

11:04.456 --> 11:07.959
Every single one of our

11:04.456 --> 11:07.959
problems can be traced back

11:08.001 --> 11:10.711
to that tight-assed,

11:08.001 --> 11:10.711
overachieving,

11:10.753 --> 11:15.925
marathon-running,

11:10.753 --> 11:15.925
master chef,

11:10.753 --> 11:15.925

Oh, you're welcome, Dewey.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.220
Don't worry about this mess.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.220
I'll take care of it.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.721
Boys, just sit there

12:00.261 --> 12:02.721
and... relax.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.601
All right,

12:03.806 --> 12:06.601
what the hell is going on?

12:06.643 --> 12:07.768
I'm not sure, but I think

12:07.810 --> 12:08.936
he's feeling guilty

12:07.810 --> 12:08.936
about something.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.813
Maybe we can exploit it.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.691
How?

12:10.855 --> 12:12.691
Why don't we send

12:10.855 --> 12:12.691
Dewey in there crying

12:12.731 --> 12:14.775
about the train set

12:12.731 --> 12:14.775
Mom put in the attic?

12:14.817 --> 12:16.444
Mom didn't put a train set

12:14.817 --> 12:16.444
in the attic.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.613
Exactly. When he's up

12:16.486 --> 12:18.613
there trying to find it,

12:18.655 --> 12:20.073
you and I can dig up

12:18.655 --> 12:20.073
the fireworks

12:20.114 --> 12:21.032
before mom gets home.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.783
Dewey, we need you to cry.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.952
But it's got to be the

12:22.825 --> 12:24.952
right kind of crying.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.663
Not sobbing,

12:24.994 --> 12:26.663
more of a whiny sound

12:26.705 --> 12:27.788
with a penetrating quality.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.791
Give me a moment.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.252
Okay, that was a good idea.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.878
The boys are happy.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.838
I think you've got them

12:33.920 --> 12:35.838
motivated to behave themselves,

12:35.880 --> 12:37.798
and, and Lois is,

12:35.880 --> 12:37.798
is going to see

12:37.840 --> 12:39.967
that I can handle them

12:37.840 --> 12:39.967
without her.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.052
Are you kidding me?

12:41.094 --> 12:42.803
You've gone soft.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.847
You've totally

12:42.845 --> 12:44.847
lost the boys' respect.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.474
Lois isn't going to like this.

12:46.516 --> 12:47.684
Come on.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.102
They're under control.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.729
But what if they aren't?

12:50.769 --> 12:52.522
What if they're

12:50.769 --> 12:52.522
just pretending to behave

12:52.564 --> 12:53.814
so they can set you up?

12:53.856 --> 12:55.191
(dishes clanging)

12:55.233 --> 12:56.901
You've got to

12:55.233 --> 12:56.901
occupy these boys,

12:56.943 --> 12:59.613
keep them so busy,

12:56.943 --> 12:59.613
they don't have time

12:56.943 --> 12:59.613
to get in trouble.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.905
How am I going

12:59.654 --> 13:00.905
to keep them busy?

13:00.947 --> 13:02.823
Well, you'd better

13:00.947 --> 13:02.823
find a way.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.451
(Dewey crying)

13:04.492 --> 13:05.826
Dad, Dewey really

13:04.492 --> 13:05.826
wants you to...

13:05.868 --> 13:08.413
Boys, let's spend a

13:05.868 --> 13:08.413
little time together.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.331
We can, uh... Ah!

13:08.455 --> 13:10.331
I know, I know!

13:10.373 --> 13:11.916
We can, uh, do

13:10.373 --> 13:11.916
some calisthenics.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.461
What?

13:11.958 --> 13:14.461
Come on, you boys

13:11.958 --> 13:14.461
love to exercise.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.837
But I just ate

13:14.502 --> 13:16.837
a ton of ice cream.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.465
All the more reason.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.840
You are starting to get

13:18.506 --> 13:19.840
a little flabby. Come on.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.842
(laughing)

13:21.884 --> 13:23.470
I'm too full.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.930
Well, when you start moving,

13:23.511 --> 13:25.930
you'll feel better!

13:25.972 --> 13:27.848
Let's go! One, two.

13:27.890 --> 13:28.642
One, two.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.602
One, two.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.564
Stupid, stupid.

13:34.606 --> 13:35.856
It was a terrible idea.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.525
It was a great idea.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.778
A great idea

13:37.567 --> 13:39.778
poorly executed.

13:39.818 --> 13:42.863
Terrible idea,

13:39.818 --> 13:42.863
terrible execution.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.865
Why don't you just lock

13:42.905 --> 13:44.865
them in the bathroom

13:44.907 --> 13:47.452
till Lois gets home,

13:44.907 --> 13:47.452
and be done with it?!

13:47.494 --> 13:49.162
(laughter)

13:49.203 --> 13:51.956
Shh!

13:51.998 --> 13:53.124
Look at that house.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.833
It's perfect.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.379
No, no, no!

13:58.421 --> 14:00.757
We didn't come here

13:58.421 --> 14:00.757
for mindless vandalism.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.967
We came to screw

14:00.799 --> 14:02.967
up her car.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.177
Let's see how she feels

14:04.218 --> 14:06.387
when she's ten minutes

14:04.218 --> 14:06.387
late for carpool

14:06.429 --> 14:07.930
like a real person.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.808
She probably

14:07.972 --> 14:09.808
won't even be able

14:09.848 --> 14:11.976
to get out of bed

14:09.848 --> 14:11.976
in the morning.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.145
Yeah, this time next year

14:14.187 --> 14:16.272
she's going to be

14:14.187 --> 14:16.272
living in a trailer

14:16.314 --> 14:18.899
with a little ceramic donkey

14:16.314 --> 14:18.899
in the front yard.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.276
(laughing)

14:20.318 --> 14:21.861
Oh, shh!

14:26.407 --> 14:28.618
Shh!

14:31.538 --> 14:34.290
She's wearing pearls

14:31.538 --> 14:34.290
to make cookies?

14:34.332 --> 14:35.625
Doilies?

14:35.667 --> 14:38.002
What kind of a monster

14:35.667 --> 14:38.002
is this woman?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.839
Oh, God, those

14:38.044 --> 14:40.839
cookies smell good.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.549
Let's kill her

14:40.880 --> 14:42.549
and eat them.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.551
Karen...

14:44.592 --> 14:46.886
why don't you go

14:44.592 --> 14:46.886
stand guard?

14:49.013 --> 14:50.139
Come on.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.641
(snickering)

14:51.683 --> 14:53.267
Shh! Shh!

14:56.979 --> 14:58.439
(stifled laughter)

14:58.481 --> 15:00.400
(laughing)

14:58.481 --> 15:00.400
Shh!

15:00.441 --> 15:02.443
(laughing)

15:05.029 --> 15:06.823
Ooh.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.950
One of us should probably

15:06.865 --> 15:09.950
know something about cars.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.119
Ah, doesn't matter, just

15:09.992 --> 15:12.119
pull some of the wires.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.788
Let's get out of here.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.456
(screaming laughter)

15:15.498 --> 15:17.917
(laughing hysterically)

15:18.835 --> 15:19.960
Karen, Karen.

15:20.002 --> 15:20.961
You got to stop.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.046
Karen.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.964
You got to settle down.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.217
Whoa!

15:26.259 --> 15:27.385
Karen, why don't you see

15:27.427 --> 15:30.012
if you can say

15:27.427 --> 15:30.012
the alphabet backwards.

15:30.054 --> 15:33.266
Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q

15:33.307 --> 15:36.977
P, O, N, M, L, K, J, I,

15:33.307 --> 15:36.977
H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.229
(giggling)

15:38.271 --> 15:40.231
I've been pulled over

15:38.271 --> 15:40.231
a few times.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.650
Hey! Lillian's gone.

15:42.692 --> 15:43.943
What do you mean

15:42.692 --> 15:43.943
Lillian's gone?

15:45.278 --> 15:46.279
(gasping)

15:47.488 --> 15:48.989
Run!

15:49.031 --> 15:53.202
(screaming)

15:55.872 --> 15:58.332
(screaming continuing)

16:17.685 --> 16:20.521
This is a pointless exercise.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.521
You haven't proven a thing.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.398
You certainly haven't determined

16:20.563 --> 16:22.398
what my limits are.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.733
None of this

16:22.440 --> 16:23.733
has bothered me.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.026
And if you think it has,

16:23.775 --> 16:26.026
the joke is on you.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.070
Clench.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.955
That's the third time

16:36.996 --> 16:38.331
he drove

16:36.996 --> 16:38.331
down that alley.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.124
He knows we're in here.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.626
This is gross.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.086
I can't believe

16:41.668 --> 16:44.086
I'm wearing open-toed shoes.

16:44.128 --> 16:48.048
(crying):

16:44.128 --> 16:48.048
I can't believe I'm hiding

16:44.128 --> 16:48.048
from the cops in a Dumpster.

16:48.090 --> 16:52.052
I just wanted to

16:48.090 --> 16:52.052
talk about books.

16:52.094 --> 16:56.349
Oh, and it was

16:52.094 --> 16:56.349
such a good book, too.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.727
The foreshadowing was effective

16:56.390 --> 16:59.727
without being heavy-handed,

16:59.769 --> 17:01.646
the characters were, were flawed

17:01.688 --> 17:03.105
but compelling,

17:03.147 --> 17:05.859
and the entire story

17:03.147 --> 17:05.859
was brimming with insight

17:05.900 --> 17:09.153
(choking up):

17:05.900 --> 17:09.153
into the human condition.

17:09.195 --> 17:12.072
But how did you even

17:09.195 --> 17:12.072
find time to read it?

17:12.114 --> 17:14.116
Your family sounds

17:12.114 --> 17:14.116
so horrible.

17:14.158 --> 17:17.077
I was lying.

17:17.119 --> 17:21.374
I made all that stuff up

17:17.119 --> 17:21.374
so that I would fit in.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.084
They're wonderful.

17:24.126 --> 17:28.088
I mean, they're idiots,

17:24.126 --> 17:28.088
but at least they try.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.174
They wanted me to have

17:28.130 --> 17:30.174
this nice evening,

17:30.216 --> 17:31.926
and look what

17:30.216 --> 17:31.926
I did with it.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.095
What are you doing?

17:35.137 --> 17:36.138
You'll see.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.391
Go home to your family

17:36.180 --> 17:38.391
and hug them for me.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.726
They sound wonderful.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.478
Hi, piggies!

17:42.520 --> 17:44.605
Over here!

17:44.647 --> 17:46.357
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.108
(grunting)

17:48.150 --> 17:49.151
(squeals)

17:51.320 --> 17:52.739
Come on!

17:52.780 --> 17:54.824
Show me what you got!

17:56.200 --> 18:00.371
Am I supposed to be afraid

17:56.200 --> 18:00.371
of an electric shaver?

18:00.413 --> 18:02.373
(Taser buzzes,

18:00.413 --> 18:02.373
Karen screams)

18:04.333 --> 18:06.627
NARRATOR:

18:04.333 --> 18:06.627
It's lighter

18:04.333 --> 18:06.627
than most other minerals...

18:06.669 --> 18:09.380
Why is he making us watch

18:06.669 --> 18:09.380
a documentary about salt?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.549
Would you rather still be locked

18:09.422 --> 18:11.549
in the bathroom?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.927
Or be chased by

18:11.591 --> 18:13.927
the hug monster?

18:13.968 --> 18:16.387
Will you just

18:13.968 --> 18:16.387
do something?

18:13.968 --> 18:16.387
I'm trying.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.057
But every time we make a move,

18:16.429 --> 18:19.057
he's two steps ahead of us.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.140
He's impossible to predict.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.226
At least with Mom,

18:20.182 --> 18:22.226
you get a little consistency.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.520
But Dad's operating

18:22.268 --> 18:24.520
on a whole other plane.

18:24.562 --> 18:25.605
(sighs)

18:25.646 --> 18:29.108
Hey, they put salt

18:25.646 --> 18:29.108
on French fries.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.652
Ground them.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.404
Cut off their

18:31.694 --> 18:33.404
food supply.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.364
They just need love.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.116
Give them the belt.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.536
(small Hals talking)

18:40.578 --> 18:43.122
(all talking at once)

18:47.293 --> 18:49.879
These are precious years!

18:49.921 --> 18:51.839
Get in the car and go.

18:51.881 --> 18:55.134
(all talking at once)

19:05.227 --> 19:08.606
Shut up!

19:09.899 --> 19:12.401
Okay, that's it.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.448
I am going to take a bath.

19:17.490 --> 19:21.243
I'm asking you boys

19:17.490 --> 19:21.243
one last time to behave.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.411
Not for me

19:22.453 --> 19:24.204
but for your mother.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.499
After all she does for you,

19:26.540 --> 19:28.417
one night of peace

19:26.540 --> 19:28.417
shouldn't be too much

19:28.459 --> 19:30.044
to ask for.

19:30.086 --> 19:34.173
So if you love her,

19:30.086 --> 19:34.173
you will do this for her.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.017
Wow, Francis,

19:44.058 --> 19:45.893
I've never had anyone

19:44.058 --> 19:45.893
empty the box before.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.227
I'm out of props.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.228
You know,

19:47.269 --> 19:48.228
I wasn't on board

19:48.270 --> 19:49.856
with your little

19:48.270 --> 19:49.856
experiment at first,

19:49.897 --> 19:50.940
but I got to admit,

19:50.982 --> 19:52.817
I learned a lot

19:50.982 --> 19:52.817
about myself tonight.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.694
I mean, who am I

19:52.859 --> 19:54.694
to judge other people

19:54.735 --> 19:56.236
for the choices they make?

19:56.278 --> 19:57.321
You know, for now on

19:57.363 --> 19:59.239
I'm going to be a little

19:57.363 --> 19:59.239
more understanding

19:59.281 --> 20:00.700
and a lot more humble.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.660
You want to stop

20:00.741 --> 20:02.660
for some dinner?

20:02.702 --> 20:05.163
What, like this?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.122
Sure.

20:06.164 --> 20:08.166
Why not like this?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.959
Have you ever thought

20:08.207 --> 20:09.959
about writing a book?

20:10.001 --> 20:12.211
Because I'm sure there's

20:10.001 --> 20:12.211
a lot of people...

20:10.001 --> 20:12.211
Hey, Myrna.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.382
What time's the pageant?

20:20.302 --> 20:22.262
Fluffy's collar?

20:22.304 --> 20:24.264
Mom said he ran away.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.558
Get out of there, Dewey.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.103
Tracy really

20:26.809 --> 20:29.103
should have invited us.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.271
This is what people get

20:29.145 --> 20:31.271
for being rude.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.149
Okay, we'll hide these

20:31.313 --> 20:33.149
in the closet tonight.

20:33.191 --> 20:34.775
When we get out,

20:33.191 --> 20:34.775
we'll cover up the hole,

20:34.817 --> 20:35.776
and by the time Mom's home,

20:35.818 --> 20:37.195
we'll be in bed

20:35.818 --> 20:37.195
sleeping like babies.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.278
LOIS:

20:37.236 --> 20:38.278
Boys!

20:38.320 --> 20:40.990
Fireworks?!

20:41.032 --> 20:43.201
Fireworks?!

20:43.242 --> 20:45.119
(grunting)

20:45.161 --> 20:47.496
How did she...?

20:45.161 --> 20:47.496
I don't know.

20:47.538 --> 20:50.208
You boys are in so much trouble.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.292
I can't leave you

20:50.249 --> 20:52.292
alone for a second!

20:52.334 --> 20:53.377
I guess next time I go out,

20:53.419 --> 20:55.337
I'll have to chain you

20:53.419 --> 20:55.337
to the floor.

20:55.379 --> 20:58.925
We tell you to behave,

20:55.379 --> 20:58.925
and you don't even

20:55.379 --> 20:58.925
pretend to listen!

20:58.966 --> 21:00.968
You might as well

20:58.966 --> 21:00.968
cut off your ears

21:01.010 --> 21:03.221
and throw them in the trash

21:01.010 --> 21:03.221
for as little as you use them.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.556
You are grounded

21:03.262 --> 21:05.556
for the next month!

21:05.598 --> 21:07.183
OFFICER:

21:05.598 --> 21:07.183
Get down on the ground

21:07.225 --> 21:08.684
with your hands

21:07.225 --> 21:08.684
behind your head!

21:08.726 --> 21:10.895
And while you're

21:08.726 --> 21:10.895
being punished,

21:10.937 --> 21:15.315
I hope your friends

21:10.937 --> 21:15.315
are doing all sorts of fun stuff

21:15.357 --> 21:18.318
because you won't

21:15.357 --> 21:18.318
be doing any of it!

21:18.360 --> 21:20.320
You are going to suffer!

21:20.362 --> 21:21.781
No TV!

21:21.822 --> 21:23.574
Oh, I should get out there.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.574
No visitors!

21:23.616 --> 21:25.118
Nah, you'd just screw it up.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.120
Good call.
