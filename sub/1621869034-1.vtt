WEBVTT

00:04.831 --> 00:06.465
Yo, Matt.

00:06.498 --> 00:07.834
It's crazy, man.

00:07.867 --> 00:10.335
We're really making this happen.

00:10.369 --> 00:12.270
Uh, this scene right here,
I'm gonna need you to...

00:12.304 --> 00:14.206
You guys, you know,
you're talking on the beach,

00:14.239 --> 00:15.875
you're chillin', you're vibin'.

00:17.710 --> 00:20.178
Man, y'all realize this is
our last year of college.

00:20.212 --> 00:23.615
After this, we gotta get jobs,
pay for student loans.

00:23.650 --> 00:25.550
It never goes away.

00:25.584 --> 00:27.419
Dude, we're on spring break
right now.

00:27.452 --> 00:28.387
We're in paradise,

00:28.420 --> 00:30.222
and we should be having
the time of our lives,

00:30.255 --> 00:31.791
instead of listening to you
talking some depressing

00:31.824 --> 00:32.892
after-school bullshit.

00:32.925 --> 00:36.294
You way too young to be having
some midlife crisis.

00:36.328 --> 00:38.831
I hear what you're saying,
but the thing is, yo,

00:38.865 --> 00:41.600
we're young and we're trying
to have some fun.

00:41.634 --> 00:43.670
So, see those hunnies
back there?

00:43.703 --> 00:46.271
Let's kinda go over that way
and talk about this later?

00:46.304 --> 00:47.539
All right?

00:51.510 --> 00:52.745
And cut.

00:53.913 --> 00:54.781
Woo!

00:54.814 --> 00:57.750
- Aw, come on, Ced...
- Matthew Hillard,

00:57.784 --> 01:00.687
the next big thing out here
makin' it happen!

01:00.720 --> 01:02.989
We on the set
of your first feature film, man,

01:03.022 --> 01:03.956
Life's A Beach.

01:03.990 --> 01:06.291
Talk to the people,
all your future fans.

01:06.324 --> 01:08.928
- What you want 'em to know?
- Man, I don't know, man.

01:08.961 --> 01:12.497
I'm just out here
living my dreams, man, you know?

01:12.531 --> 01:15.500
I want all y'all to do
the same thing too, aight?

01:15.534 --> 01:16.903
Live out your dreams.

01:50.502 --> 01:52.471
Day 470.

01:56.976 --> 01:59.311
Sometimes I, um,

01:59.344 --> 02:03.448
feel like Tom Hanks
in Cast Away,

02:03.482 --> 02:05.785
or Matt Damon
in The Martian,

02:05.818 --> 02:07.820
or...

02:07.854 --> 02:10.522
Chris in Into the Wild.

02:10.555 --> 02:13.458
What was that guy's deal, man?

02:13.492 --> 02:17.864
The wilderness is just not
a safe place to be.

02:17.897 --> 02:22.802
But I'm not in the wild,
I'm just...

02:22.835 --> 02:26.571
I'm just at my house,
and it's... it's just crazy.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.842
I could always
just do this, right?

02:29.876 --> 02:32.044
Okay.

02:34.781 --> 02:36.048
Hey, everyone.

02:36.082 --> 02:39.451
It's me, Matt, and I'm back.

02:39.484 --> 02:42.354
I just... I just want to update
everyone on the progress

02:42.387 --> 02:44.724
of my new movie,
Home Improvement.

02:44.757 --> 02:47.827
Or Honey, I'm Home.

02:47.860 --> 02:49.361
Or It's Good to Be Home.

02:49.394 --> 02:50.830
I'm still... I'm still working
on the title.

02:50.863 --> 02:54.533
Uh, let's see,
we got a few comments here.

02:54.566 --> 02:57.937
IllJ says, "Matt, I support
your creative spirit.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.337
Keep up the good work."

02:59.371 --> 03:00.773
IllJ, I'm on it.

03:00.807 --> 03:02.842
Um, PrettyPink says,

03:02.875 --> 03:05.945
"Matt, when will you go back
to making real movies?"

03:05.978 --> 03:09.816
Uh, hey, PP, I, um,

03:09.849 --> 03:13.518
I am making a real movie,
it's just from home.

03:13.552 --> 03:15.554
Uh, yeah...

03:15.587 --> 03:17.556
EverDark says,

03:17.589 --> 03:19.926
"Fuck you, Matt,
you're a phony."

03:19.959 --> 03:22.628
Um... okay.

03:22.662 --> 03:25.131
Uh, and HappyGuy says,

03:25.164 --> 03:28.701
"Matt, you should kill
yourself."

03:28.734 --> 03:31.570
Don't think I will,
but okay.

03:31.603 --> 03:34.674
I think... I think we're, uh,
we're good for today there.

03:34.707 --> 03:35.975
Okay.

03:38.878 --> 03:40.579
Okay.

03:40.612 --> 03:43.582
Time to write.

03:43.615 --> 03:45.117
Or not.

03:51.757 --> 03:54.060
And I'm broke,
I don't have a lot of money.

03:54.093 --> 03:56.428
Like if I cheat on my girl now

03:56.461 --> 03:58.898
and she decides
to bust my car windows,

03:58.931 --> 04:01.033
that's it,
I don't have car windows.

04:02.034 --> 04:05.872
I gotta put a trash bag
on my car as a window.

04:05.905 --> 04:07.740
Not even a clear one,
like a white bag,

04:07.773 --> 04:08.808
I gotta rip it off...

04:14.546 --> 04:15.882
No!

04:15.915 --> 04:18.117
We lost Bobby!

04:18.150 --> 04:19.919
Damn it!

04:30.897 --> 04:32.665
Okay.

04:32.698 --> 04:34.566
Time to write.

04:41.741 --> 04:44.476
Babe, I'm home.

04:44.509 --> 04:45.978
Babe?

04:53.618 --> 04:54.887
Hey there, you.

04:54.921 --> 04:56.222
How was your day?

04:56.255 --> 04:58.590
Uh, it was rough, honestly.

04:58.623 --> 04:59.859
But you know what they say.

04:59.892 --> 05:01.127
Hopefully tomorrow's better,
right?

05:01.160 --> 05:03.595
You maybe wanna talk about it,
or...

05:03.629 --> 05:05.530
Sure, why not?

05:05.563 --> 05:07.667
So, I go into work
and I punch into the clock,

05:07.700 --> 05:09.235
and I have to deal
with these idiot customers

05:09.268 --> 05:10.937
who are like,
"How does this look on me?

05:10.970 --> 05:12.638
Does this make me look fat?"

05:12.672 --> 05:14.674
And the answer is, "Yes, ma'am,
it makes you look fat

05:14.707 --> 05:16.742
because you are fat."

05:16.776 --> 05:17.910
- Right.
- And Brittany...

05:17.944 --> 05:19.745
Oh my gosh, babe, Brittany

05:19.779 --> 05:22.715
gets on my nerves so bad!

05:22.748 --> 05:25.685
Literally, everything's just
so happy all the time with her.

05:25.718 --> 05:26.852
And then I go
to my acting class,

05:26.886 --> 05:29.789
we learn the same thing
over and over and over again,

05:29.822 --> 05:32.191
and then I go to my audition
and it ends with, "Thanks,

05:32.224 --> 05:35.493
we'll call you,"
and they never do.

05:35.527 --> 05:38.030
And I'm just starving,
so I'm just gonna throw on

05:38.064 --> 05:40.666
some clothes
and get some food.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.101
Damn.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.170
Yeah, that... that sounds
really rough.

05:46.305 --> 05:49.041
And a lot like a monologue.

05:49.075 --> 05:51.609
But why... why you gotta go out
though?

05:51.644 --> 05:53.511
Right, why don't you
just stay in with me?

05:53.545 --> 05:55.613
We could, uh,
order some takeout,

05:55.648 --> 05:57.216
you know,
could Netflix and chill.

05:57.249 --> 05:58.951
Netflix and chill,
that's all you ever do

05:58.985 --> 06:00.886
is Netflix and chill,
play videogames,

06:00.920 --> 06:02.221
Netflix and chill some more,

06:02.254 --> 06:03.689
and that's why
you're getting fat.

06:03.723 --> 06:05.858
I'm not getting fat!

06:05.891 --> 06:08.260
What... we both know
I have a high metabolism,

06:08.294 --> 06:10.029
and I do CrossFit.

06:10.062 --> 06:13.065
And you and I both know
I don't just sit around all day

06:13.099 --> 06:14.934
and watch TV
and play videogames.

06:14.967 --> 06:16.635
I'm working hard on my movie.

06:20.840 --> 06:21.974
Samantha, come on,
wait a minute!

06:22.008 --> 06:23.608
- Look, look...
- What, what is it?

06:23.642 --> 06:26.112
Look, I just ordered
your favorite shrimp linguini,

06:26.145 --> 06:28.114
all right, we can watch
whatever you wanna watch,

06:28.147 --> 06:29.715
I'll even give you a foot rub.

06:31.684 --> 06:34.320
- A foot rub does seem tempting.
- Come on.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.988
No, no, I gotta go,
I have stuff to do.

06:36.022 --> 06:37.589
But where are you
rushing off to?

06:37.622 --> 06:38.724
You've been gone all day.

06:38.758 --> 06:40.059
To go hang out
with friends, Matt,

06:40.092 --> 06:42.128
something you don't know about
'cause you don't have any,

06:42.161 --> 06:43.763
- do you?
- I do.

06:43.796 --> 06:46.065
You do, who?

06:46.098 --> 06:47.233
Cedric's my friend.

06:47.266 --> 06:51.237
Cedric, the guy who helped you
produce your first film?

06:52.738 --> 06:53.839
Okay, all right.

06:53.873 --> 06:56.075
When's the last time you spoke
with Cedric, Matt?

06:56.108 --> 06:59.145
Uh...

06:59.178 --> 07:00.746
Huh?

07:00.780 --> 07:02.114
Exactly.
Wanna know why?

07:02.148 --> 07:04.150
Because he became
a big Hollywood producer

07:04.183 --> 07:05.951
while you became
this little hermit thing.

07:05.985 --> 07:06.886
And you know what,
another thing,

07:06.919 --> 07:08.586
I should've been
in that dag-gone movie.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.122
- Oh, here we go.
- Yeah, here we go again.

07:10.156 --> 07:11.223
We had just started dating.

07:11.257 --> 07:13.659
I didn't even know
you wanted to be an actress.

07:13.692 --> 07:14.760
How could you not know?

07:14.794 --> 07:18.064
I was a model, obviously
I wanted to be an actress.

07:18.097 --> 07:19.832
You know what,
I'm not doing this with you.

07:19.865 --> 07:22.968
- I gotta go.
- Samantha! Can you at least...

07:23.002 --> 07:24.602
What?

07:24.637 --> 07:26.705
Can you please take out
the trash

07:26.739 --> 07:28.941
before you... before you go?

07:32.178 --> 07:33.946
Come on!

07:44.190 --> 07:45.925
What the fuck?

07:51.230 --> 07:54.100
Matt, what are you doing
with my phone?

07:55.367 --> 07:57.670
Better question:

07:57.703 --> 07:59.672
Why is this on here?

08:02.208 --> 08:03.909
I don't remember
a man that big.

08:03.943 --> 08:05.077
- What?
- Huh?

08:05.111 --> 08:07.413
Are you being serious right now?

08:10.316 --> 08:11.917
No! Babe, no!

08:11.951 --> 08:12.985
This is a...

08:13.953 --> 08:14.753
This is a joke.

08:14.787 --> 08:16.422
Is this guy's dick
the punchline?

08:16.455 --> 08:17.690
'Cause I'm not laughing.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.662
You know what?

08:23.696 --> 08:24.997
You're right.

08:26.232 --> 08:29.068
You're so right,
you're so right.

08:33.105 --> 08:35.708
It's just that this weirdo
is, you know,

08:35.741 --> 08:38.811
sending me pictures
of his really huge dick,

08:38.844 --> 08:39.745
and...

08:41.013 --> 08:43.215
He just makes me feel violated,
you know?

08:43.249 --> 08:44.917
I feel violated right now.

08:44.950 --> 08:47.153
Samantha, Samantha.

08:47.186 --> 08:49.989
You seriously can't be trying
to get me to sympathize for you

08:50.022 --> 08:52.391
with those fake-ass
Paula Patton tears of yours.

08:55.261 --> 08:57.897
Okay. All right.

08:57.930 --> 09:00.399
So what do you wanna hear,
that I cheated on you?

09:00.432 --> 09:02.067
No, not really!

09:02.101 --> 09:04.870
Well, I did. Sorry.

09:04.904 --> 09:06.472
Not sorry.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.807
Why, Samantha?

09:08.841 --> 09:10.709
Wait, haven't I been good
to you?

09:10.743 --> 09:12.745
No! Not at...
are you serious?

09:12.778 --> 09:14.079
You haven't taken me out
in forever.

09:14.113 --> 09:15.915
No trips, no shopping,
no nothin',

09:15.948 --> 09:17.116
not that you could
'cause I'm sure

09:17.149 --> 09:19.285
that Life's A Beach money
has gots to be gone by now.

09:19.318 --> 09:21.287
- Sam.
- And you know what else?

09:21.320 --> 09:23.756
You haven't been, you know,

09:23.789 --> 09:25.457
satisfying me,

09:25.491 --> 09:26.926
you know, in the manly ways.

09:26.959 --> 09:30.029
Okay, that was like
the last couple of times.

09:30.062 --> 09:33.065
Okay, and I told you,
I've... I've had a lot on my mind.

09:33.098 --> 09:35.334
The pressure
of making this film.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.436
You... Matt, oh my gosh.

09:37.469 --> 09:38.871
Listen to me.

09:38.904 --> 09:40.739
There is no film, okay?

09:40.773 --> 09:41.807
There's no film.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.109
There's just you in this house

09:44.143 --> 09:46.045
afraid to go outside
and make shit happen.

09:46.078 --> 09:47.112
That's what there is.

09:47.146 --> 09:48.881
Give me my damn phone.

09:48.914 --> 09:50.082
Samantha, come on!

09:50.115 --> 09:51.283
Hey, wait!

09:51.317 --> 09:52.785
Wait, why are you leaving?

09:52.818 --> 09:54.086
Can we at least just talk?

09:54.119 --> 09:55.287
You wanna talk?

09:55.321 --> 09:57.056
You wanna work things out?

09:57.089 --> 09:59.291
Then come out here
and show me, Matt.

09:59.325 --> 10:01.227
Show me that you really want me.

10:01.260 --> 10:04.330
Samantha, I do want you.

10:05.531 --> 10:07.466
Then come show me.

10:07.499 --> 10:08.867
Come outside.

10:15.241 --> 10:17.142
Ooh.

10:17.176 --> 10:20.446
You know what, I knew it,
I am so done, Matthew.

10:20.479 --> 10:22.881
No, Samantha, come on!

10:24.383 --> 10:25.884
Fuck.

10:37.162 --> 10:38.864
The bin is just in the back.

10:38.897 --> 10:41.867
I could give you a tip. It's...

10:41.900 --> 10:44.069
It's literally down the side...

10:44.103 --> 10:46.472
That's cool, man.

10:46.505 --> 10:49.541
Hey, bro, hey,
no five stars for you.

10:53.279 --> 10:56.282
Man, forget you, Sarah!

10:56.315 --> 11:00.119
How could you leave Peter
for a rock star, man?

11:01.353 --> 11:02.388
Fucked up.

11:06.258 --> 11:08.294
Wait.

11:08.327 --> 11:11.330
Wait, did she leave me
for a rock star?

11:15.334 --> 11:18.604
Oh, man, this is her favorite.

11:23.075 --> 11:25.344
It's so good.

11:52.438 --> 11:55.407
This'll make
for some really good footage.

12:08.954 --> 12:11.190
Hey, Dave, uh,

12:11.223 --> 12:14.059
I don't recall requesting
any maintenance or anything.

12:14.093 --> 12:15.294
Maintenance?

12:15.327 --> 12:16.528
That's funny.

12:16.562 --> 12:18.964
Then how can I help you?

12:18.997 --> 12:20.165
Uh, the better question is,

12:20.199 --> 12:24.036
how can you help yourself
not get kicked out this bitch?

12:24.069 --> 12:25.571
I don't understand.

12:25.604 --> 12:26.905
Maybe this'll help.

12:29.241 --> 12:32.010
A three-day pay or quit?

12:32.044 --> 12:33.078
No.

12:33.112 --> 12:34.647
No, this doesn't make any sense.

12:34.681 --> 12:36.081
I just paid my rent.

12:36.115 --> 12:37.483
Yeah, with a check that bounced,

12:37.516 --> 12:39.218
like you'll have to do
very soon.

12:39.251 --> 12:41.220
I'm not leaving my place, man.

12:41.253 --> 12:44.623
Look, look, I'ma take care
of this right now, all right?

12:44.657 --> 12:46.191
Just, hold up.

12:49.294 --> 12:51.964
Here, man.

12:54.166 --> 12:56.301
Man, I'm not taking this, man!

12:56.335 --> 12:58.904
You got three days,
three motherfucking days.

13:01.674 --> 13:02.642
Wow.

13:04.410 --> 13:06.145
Okay.

13:09.148 --> 13:12.151
It's cool, it's cool.

13:12.184 --> 13:16.121
It's just more motivation for me
to make this film happen, right?

13:16.155 --> 13:19.358
Okay, so let's finish up
this script.

13:23.262 --> 13:25.230
It's almost done.

13:25.264 --> 13:28.167
Might as well just start
casting it, right?

13:28.200 --> 13:29.435
Okay.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.639
Steve...

13:32.672 --> 13:34.339
He could work.

13:34.373 --> 13:35.574
Yeah.

13:36.643 --> 13:38.076
Okay.

13:45.050 --> 13:46.351
Hey, Steven.

13:46.385 --> 13:48.120
It's, uh, Matt Hillard.

13:49.455 --> 13:50.723
Hey.

13:50.757 --> 13:52.725
Hey, Steven,
thank you so much, man,

13:52.759 --> 13:54.661
for coming by
on such short notice.

13:54.694 --> 13:56.763
Just Steve,
and it's all good, man.

13:56.796 --> 13:58.096
I love acting.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.732
I mean, it means
everything to me.

13:59.766 --> 14:00.999
It's life.

14:01.033 --> 14:02.434
That's great!

14:02.468 --> 14:04.737
Let's, um, let's get
to auditioning then.

14:04.771 --> 14:06.673
All right.

14:06.706 --> 14:08.607
Right.

14:08.641 --> 14:10.476
I'm sorry I don't have
any sides.

14:10.509 --> 14:12.578
I'm still finishing up
the script, but, uh,

14:12.611 --> 14:15.280
you can do like a monologue
if you have one.

14:16.683 --> 14:17.750
I got you, buddy.

14:17.784 --> 14:19.151
Okay, cool.

14:19.184 --> 14:21.320
- Here goes everything.
- All right.

14:22.387 --> 14:24.056
So you wanna mess with me, pal?

14:24.089 --> 14:26.558
Okay, how about I snatch
your eyes out,

14:26.592 --> 14:28.795
cram 'em down your throat,
and have you choke on them?

14:28.828 --> 14:30.496
You little punk pussy bitch!

14:32.331 --> 14:34.466
Scene, and scene,
scene, scene.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.534
Steven, scene.

14:37.402 --> 14:40.072
Okay, yeah, wow.

14:40.105 --> 14:41.306
So, do I get the part?

14:41.340 --> 14:43.509
Um...

14:43.542 --> 14:46.245
what was that from?

14:46.278 --> 14:48.213
Well, when I was
in the psych ward,

14:48.247 --> 14:50.282
shit got real.

14:50.315 --> 14:53.285
Okay.

14:53.318 --> 14:55.487
- I'll call you.
- You better, man.

14:55.521 --> 14:59.458
Otherwise I'll come back
and stab you in the head.

15:04.396 --> 15:05.597
Oh, shit.

15:14.606 --> 15:15.607
Ced?

15:15.642 --> 15:17.744
Matthew Hillard.

15:17.777 --> 15:18.845
What up, man?

15:18.878 --> 15:20.412
Man, what's up?

15:20.445 --> 15:22.381
It's been a long time.

15:22.414 --> 15:24.182
Way too long.

15:24.216 --> 15:25.752
I heard you, uh,

15:25.785 --> 15:28.554
you're working on some type
of home video,

15:28.587 --> 15:30.757
movie type of thing?

15:30.790 --> 15:33.125
Yeah, yeah, it's, uh,

15:33.158 --> 15:35.427
a little bit of like
a little passion project,

15:35.460 --> 15:36.796
you know, something like that.

15:38.564 --> 15:42.835
Yeah, uh, passion projects
are cool, Matt, they really are,

15:42.869 --> 15:45.237
but they don't pay the bills.

15:45.270 --> 15:46.873
You know what does though,
right?

15:46.906 --> 15:50.142
I don't know, uh,
comic book movies?

15:50.175 --> 15:51.744
Okay, well, those pay
for everything,

15:51.778 --> 15:55.447
but what I'm talking about,
Matt, is sequels.

15:55.480 --> 15:59.719
- Sequels?
- Sequels.

15:59.752 --> 16:01.788
Wait, you calling
to talk to me about the...

16:01.821 --> 16:04.423
You're goddamn right I am, Matt.

16:04.456 --> 16:06.859
Life's A Beach 2.
Let's do it, what you think?

16:07.559 --> 16:09.494
Man, I can't afford this,

16:09.528 --> 16:11.563
to fund another feature
right now, man.

16:11.597 --> 16:13.332
I am so happy you said that

16:13.365 --> 16:15.534
because this time,
you wouldn't have to.

16:15.567 --> 16:18.604
A studio wants to finance it
for us, Matt.

16:18.638 --> 16:20.339
All we gotta do now

16:20.372 --> 16:22.441
is attach you
as the writer and director.

16:22.474 --> 16:24.242
But hey, this deal, man,

16:24.276 --> 16:25.812
it's off the table
in a few weeks, man.

16:25.845 --> 16:27.179
We gotta close it soon.

16:27.212 --> 16:30.616
Nah, I can't do it, man.

16:30.650 --> 16:32.284
Nah, I can't do it.

16:32.317 --> 16:34.620
Still refusing to walk
out the door, ain't you, Matt?

16:36.455 --> 16:40.292
It's just, I got...
I got this other project, man.

16:40.325 --> 16:43.328
This... this whole breakup thing
with me and Samantha...

16:43.362 --> 16:46.431
I can't even focus
on all that right now, man.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.533
I'm trying to figure
all this out.

16:48.567 --> 16:50.268
You know what, Matt?

16:50.302 --> 16:52.537
Say no more, um,
how about I just stop by

16:52.571 --> 16:54.206
and we can talk about it
in person?

16:54.239 --> 16:55.808
I don't know,
I don't think that's...

16:55.842 --> 16:57.677
Yeah, man, I'll see you
in an hour, we good.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.277
No, no, man...

16:59.311 --> 17:02.649
Matt, I'll see you
in like 20 minutes, my brother.

17:04.216 --> 17:06.686
I'll stand here,

17:06.719 --> 17:08.955
look over here.

17:17.630 --> 17:19.398
Hey, Ced.

17:20.432 --> 17:21.600
What's goin' on here?

17:21.634 --> 17:23.870
What's goin' on...

17:23.903 --> 17:25.537
is a party, man,

17:25.570 --> 17:27.606
and I'm here...

17:27.640 --> 17:29.876
Mmm, well, uh,

17:29.909 --> 17:33.578
we're here to celebrate
the return of Matthew Hillard,

17:33.612 --> 17:35.480
filmmaker extraordinaire, baby!

17:35.514 --> 17:37.282
Life's A Beach 2,
don't leave me hanging!

17:37.315 --> 17:40.285
Now's... now's not
a really good time, so...

17:40.318 --> 17:41.286
Loosen up, man.

17:41.319 --> 17:42.789
Ladies, make your way inside.

17:42.822 --> 17:44.556
Make yourself at home,
make a sandwich,

17:44.589 --> 17:45.992
whatever you wanna do.

17:46.025 --> 17:47.727
Ooh!

17:47.760 --> 17:49.361
I already got an erection.

17:49.394 --> 17:50.630
Let's do it!

17:54.767 --> 17:56.401
This is better than Hennessy.

17:56.435 --> 17:57.670
This is crazy.

17:58.838 --> 18:01.908
Uh, Matthew, my boy.

18:01.941 --> 18:02.875
Uh...

18:03.976 --> 18:05.745
So, about this sequel.

18:05.778 --> 18:07.312
Ced, man, I already told you,

18:07.345 --> 18:08.580
- dude, I'm not...
- You wanna do it, right?

18:08.613 --> 18:10.282
No, I'm not trying
to do that right now.

18:10.315 --> 18:11.516
Because of this other project?

18:11.550 --> 18:12.819
What's... what's it even called?

18:14.352 --> 18:17.456
I'm still working on the title.

18:17.489 --> 18:19.391
Where's the script?
Let me read it.

18:19.424 --> 18:21.560
I'm still...
I'm still working on it.

18:22.594 --> 18:24.563
Have you cast any actors?

18:25.597 --> 18:29.434
Due to a recent turn of events,

18:29.468 --> 18:33.472
I've, uh, I've decided to just
play all the parts myself.

18:37.076 --> 18:39.712
Matt, I'm not gonna lie to you,
dawg, that sounds awful.

18:40.479 --> 18:42.280
You're better than that, Matt.

18:42.314 --> 18:44.616
Come on, man, you need to be
making real money,

18:44.650 --> 18:46.551
making real movies,

18:46.585 --> 18:48.988
and gettin' a whole lot of this.

18:49.021 --> 18:50.923
Damn, you smell good.

18:50.957 --> 18:54.060
Listen, Matt,
you've always deserved better

18:54.093 --> 18:55.928
than that big-forehead-havin',

18:55.962 --> 18:58.865
weird chin,
stank-attitude-havin'...

18:58.898 --> 19:01.033
All right, Ced, Ced,
that's enough, man.

19:01.067 --> 19:03.401
That's enough, I'm not...
I'm not doing the project,

19:03.435 --> 19:08.007
all right, and it's way more
than me not...

19:08.040 --> 19:09.608
you know... want...

19:09.642 --> 19:11.409
You ever seen Clerks II?

19:12.410 --> 19:13.946
I don't think anybody's seen
Clerks II.

19:13.980 --> 19:15.580
My point exactly, man.

19:15.614 --> 19:17.650
It's like a bad night out
with your friends

19:17.683 --> 19:19.051
that you just wish
never happened

19:19.085 --> 19:20.585
so no one talks about it.

19:21.988 --> 19:23.890
What the fuck
is he talking about?

19:23.923 --> 19:26.893
Listen, Matt, fuck Clerks II,
you understand?

19:26.926 --> 19:29.695
We are talking about
Life's A Beach 2, man.

19:30.963 --> 19:33.032
What we made together,
think about it, right?

19:33.065 --> 19:34.700
Martin is on the beach, right,

19:34.734 --> 19:36.102
contemplating getting married

19:36.135 --> 19:38.037
and everything that comes
with the married life, man,

19:38.070 --> 19:40.039
and if he really wants
to jump the broom or not.

19:40.072 --> 19:42.108
Matt, it's genius,
let's make millions!

19:43.009 --> 19:45.878
So, uh, when are
we gonna get to the sex?

19:45.912 --> 19:48.380
Because I have other clients
to see.

19:48.413 --> 19:50.482
Wait, sex?

19:50.515 --> 19:53.920
It wasn't part
of the original package,

19:53.953 --> 19:55.587
but, um...

20:00.693 --> 20:01.828
Are you serious?

20:01.861 --> 20:04.997
Oh, yeah, that's my specialty.

20:05.031 --> 20:06.431
Oh.

20:06.464 --> 20:07.399
We can talk, I know.

20:07.432 --> 20:09.702
- Excuse me, Boo, I gotta...
- Let me do this.

20:09.735 --> 20:11.637
Bitch, you gotta move now,
all right, come on.

20:11.671 --> 20:13.706
I already know,
you gotta have it too.

20:14.941 --> 20:17.109
- Hey, Ced.
- Hmm?

20:17.143 --> 20:19.946
Please tell me you didn't just
bring hookers into my house.

20:19.979 --> 20:23.415
Come on, man, I wouldn't bring
hookers in your house.

20:23.448 --> 20:24.884
I brought escorts.

20:24.917 --> 20:26.085
There's a difference!

20:26.118 --> 20:27.419
Man, what were you thinking?

20:27.452 --> 20:29.922
Man, I'm thinking that I gotta
get you outta this damn house

20:29.956 --> 20:31.556
and back out there,
back in the game,

20:31.590 --> 20:32.959
doing what you love to do, man.

20:32.992 --> 20:34.459
And don't say you don't miss it.

20:34.492 --> 20:35.928
In college,
all you talked about was

20:35.962 --> 20:37.930
how I was gonna be Brian Grazer
to your Ron Howard.

20:37.964 --> 20:38.931
I know.

20:38.965 --> 20:40.733
- People change.
- I know, Matt,

20:40.766 --> 20:42.534
and I get that, bro,
I really do.

20:42.567 --> 20:44.670
I sympathize with everything
you've been through.

20:44.704 --> 20:47.707
It's hard, but you can't
let that stop you, dawg.

20:47.740 --> 20:49.642
- You can't.
- Dude, I appreciate

20:49.675 --> 20:51.509
the pep talk, man,
I really do,

20:51.543 --> 20:53.511
but I just...
I think you should go, man.

20:53.545 --> 20:55.781
I got a movie to make happen.

20:55.815 --> 20:56.983
I already paid 'em.

20:58.516 --> 20:59.517
Let's do it.

21:00.853 --> 21:02.621
Mmm.

21:02.655 --> 21:03.723
Want some?

21:05.992 --> 21:08.194
What the fuck? No! No!

21:08.227 --> 21:10.196
Y'all gotta go, that's enough.
Cedric, handle that.

21:10.229 --> 21:11.797
- They're playing around.
- They're not playing!

21:11.831 --> 21:13.465
Y'all can't be doing this
right now.

21:13.498 --> 21:14.634
No!

21:14.667 --> 21:15.801
Where are you going?

21:15.835 --> 21:17.203
Hey, come on, ladies,
we gotta go.

21:17.236 --> 21:18.871
Matt, oh, what, you got
some nasty cyber...

21:18.905 --> 21:20.873
- Matt?
- No, man, this is my mom.

21:20.907 --> 21:22.041
Oh, tell her I said hi.

21:22.074 --> 21:24.476
- Wait, where y'all goin'?
- One sec, Ma, one sec.

21:24.509 --> 21:25.510
Hey, Ms. Hillard.

21:25.543 --> 21:26.812
Listen, Matt, Life's A Beach 2...

21:26.846 --> 21:28.014
What the hell is this?

21:28.047 --> 21:29.447
- Matt, no.
- Thank you, thank you.

21:29.481 --> 21:31.483
I'm not no gar...
hey, this is a new blazer!

21:31.516 --> 21:34.153
Matt, baby,
are you having a party?

21:34.186 --> 21:36.989
- What's wrong?
- Hey, no, yes, yes, no.

21:37.023 --> 21:39.859
I mean, no, Cedric...
Cedric brought some girls over,

21:39.892 --> 21:41.827
things got a little bit crazy.

21:41.861 --> 21:44.063
Cedric, that boy
ain't nothing but a womanizer.

21:44.096 --> 21:45.998
I don't even know why
you hang out with him.

21:46.032 --> 21:47.934
To make movies, Ma.

21:47.967 --> 21:49.969
We made movies together.

21:50.002 --> 21:51.603
Yeah, well, you don't make
movies anymore,

21:51.637 --> 21:53.072
so there's no need
to hang out, right?

21:53.105 --> 21:56.676
Which brings me
to my next point.

21:56.709 --> 21:58.978
Baby, what are you doing
for money these days?

21:59.011 --> 22:00.612
I don't understand
what's happening.

22:00.646 --> 22:04.482
I'm... I'm still making movies,
Ma, okay?

22:04.516 --> 22:07.485
I mean, I'm... I'm working
on one right now, anyway.

22:07.519 --> 22:09.221
You know what I think
you should do?

22:09.255 --> 22:11.857
I think you should go out
and make a movie

22:11.891 --> 22:14.559
like a real director, you know,
like that Mr. Spielberg.

22:14.592 --> 22:16.862
- Like Steven Spielberg?
- He is very good.

22:16.896 --> 22:20.766
And everybody likes his movies,
so you should be like that.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.135
I am a real director, Ma.

22:23.169 --> 22:25.004
I'm just trying
something different.

22:25.037 --> 22:26.238
If you say so.

22:26.272 --> 22:28.174
- Did you get the box?
- Yes, I did.

22:28.207 --> 22:30.542
- Did you open it?
- No, I didn't.

22:30.575 --> 22:33.012
- Are you gonna open it?
- I don't know, Ma.

22:33.045 --> 22:36.816
Matt, I know you don't want
to hear this,

22:36.849 --> 22:39.719
but I really think you need some
professional help, sweetheart.

22:39.752 --> 22:42.254
I... I don't need any help, Mom.

22:42.288 --> 22:45.992
I think you do, so now listen,
now just talk to me for a second

22:46.025 --> 22:48.560
because, see,
I've been reading my books,

22:48.593 --> 22:52.765
and they say you either need
a therapist or some drugs,

22:52.798 --> 22:54.967
and you know Mommy
does not do drugs

22:55.001 --> 22:57.303
and I don't want you
doing drugs...

22:57.336 --> 23:00.106
Clearly the only path
is therapist.

23:00.139 --> 23:02.008
Have you thought about that?

23:02.041 --> 23:05.211
There's a big world
out there, baby.

23:05.244 --> 23:09.148
There's butterflies
and fish and trees

23:09.181 --> 23:12.051
and everything that you haven't
seen in a very long time,

23:12.084 --> 23:13.986
and I just want you
to experience the world,

23:14.020 --> 23:18.858
and also, Samantha, your girl,
she's not gonna hang around

23:18.891 --> 23:21.827
and wanna sit in the house
all day with you.

23:21.861 --> 23:23.863
Yeah, um...

23:23.896 --> 23:26.265
Yeah, we broke up.

23:26.298 --> 23:28.801
I wonder why.

23:28.834 --> 23:30.202
So it's my fault?

23:30.236 --> 23:32.772
I'm just saying, no woman
wants to sit in the house

23:32.805 --> 23:35.007
and eat bad Chinese food
and have sad-ass foot massages,

23:35.041 --> 23:37.209
and that's all you got to offer
right now, sweetheart.

23:37.243 --> 23:40.646
Look, you need to expand
your horizons, go out,

23:40.679 --> 23:43.716
find some career opportunities
and make it happen for her.

23:43.749 --> 23:45.117
You want to keep your girl,
don't you?

23:45.151 --> 23:46.584
Oh my God, Ma, for real?

23:46.618 --> 23:48.320
- Okay, then let's make it...
- Angela!

23:48.354 --> 23:49.889
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Baby!

23:49.922 --> 23:51.290
Yes! Sorry, hang on.

23:51.323 --> 23:53.726
That's room service,
sweetheart, and, um...

23:53.759 --> 23:56.796
Oh, wow, the, um,
the food looks...

23:56.829 --> 23:58.097
really delicious.

23:58.130 --> 23:59.999
Um, Mommy's gonna...

24:00.032 --> 24:02.134
Mommy's gonna call you back,
okay, baby?

24:02.168 --> 24:03.135
All right.

24:04.970 --> 24:06.772
Fuck this.

24:17.650 --> 24:19.185
Intruder, intruder!

24:20.286 --> 24:21.887
Who the hell are you?

24:21.921 --> 24:23.122
Get off!

24:29.662 --> 24:31.063
Wait a minute.

24:32.965 --> 24:34.633
This ain't my place.

24:34.667 --> 24:35.835
No, man!

24:35.868 --> 24:37.736
No, this is not your place, man!

24:37.770 --> 24:39.638
This is mine! So get out!

24:39.672 --> 24:42.741
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.

24:42.775 --> 24:46.145
I'm smokin' a whole lot of weed
and it's got me trippin'.

24:46.178 --> 24:49.048
Well, trip the fuck
outta my place, man!

24:49.081 --> 24:52.818
Okay, all right, just give me
a second to compose myself, man.

24:52.852 --> 24:54.286
What are you doin', man?

24:54.320 --> 24:56.155
I was smokin'...

24:56.188 --> 24:59.892
I smoked some of that purple
OG Yoda kush.

24:59.925 --> 25:02.862
It was all in the bushes,
it's jungle booty.

25:02.895 --> 25:04.997
Like a goddamn safari in there.

25:05.030 --> 25:07.133
Okay, man, I don't...
I don't want to hear

25:07.166 --> 25:08.400
about all that, all right?

25:08.434 --> 25:10.236
I just... I just need you to go.

25:10.269 --> 25:12.371
Feel like a Black Tarzan
swingin' in and out...

25:12.404 --> 25:14.440
All right, I don't...
I don't want to hear about that.

25:14.473 --> 25:16.242
I need you to go.

25:16.275 --> 25:18.144
Like, right now.

25:18.177 --> 25:20.779
Okay, all right,
just hold on, my dude.

25:20.813 --> 25:22.214
Just wait a second, okay?

25:22.248 --> 25:23.883
I'm like...

25:23.916 --> 25:26.919
I'm leaving...

25:26.952 --> 25:29.221
Do I know you, man?

25:29.255 --> 25:31.657
You look mad familiar.

25:32.725 --> 25:35.694
You... you an actor?

25:38.898 --> 25:40.432
Yeah, sort... sorta.

25:42.067 --> 25:43.836
I did this movie
a while back,

25:43.869 --> 25:45.905
I wrote and I directed.

25:45.938 --> 25:47.873
It's called Life's A Beach.

25:47.907 --> 25:51.377
Oh, word, that is you!

25:51.410 --> 25:53.979
Yo, that's my joint!

25:54.013 --> 25:56.048
It's, uh, uh,

25:56.081 --> 25:59.018
Clerks at the Beach,
is what they call it, right?

25:59.051 --> 26:01.187
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

26:01.220 --> 26:02.755
Yeah, it was...

26:02.788 --> 26:03.956
it was like a, um,

26:03.989 --> 26:05.958
like a little inspiration
for the film.

26:05.991 --> 26:09.128
I just wanted to do something
like outside, you know,

26:09.161 --> 26:10.829

26:10.863 --> 26:12.998

got the beach.

26:13.032 --> 26:14.767
All them booties up in there.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.937
- Yeah, man!
- One hell of a view, Jack.

26:19.338 --> 26:22.041
You know, I do...
I do writing too.

26:22.074 --> 26:23.509
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

26:23.542 --> 26:27.446
Man, come and sit down,
man, have a seat.

26:27.479 --> 26:29.281
Yeah, so like I said, you know,

26:29.315 --> 26:31.283
I, you know,

26:31.317 --> 26:34.320
you know, started off
doing stand-up.

26:34.353 --> 26:36.188
Wait, Norman Reed?

26:36.222 --> 26:37.756
That is I.

26:37.790 --> 26:39.258
Oh, shit, man!

26:39.291 --> 26:42.228
Me and my boys, we used to...
we used to come watch you

26:42.261 --> 26:44.230

doing this for a minute.

26:44.263 --> 26:47.433
Yeah, I have, yeah,
I've been doin' it for a minute,

26:47.466 --> 26:49.468
but I ain't, like, you know,

26:49.501 --> 26:51.904
I ain't like prosper
and blow up...

26:51.937 --> 26:53.472
- Right, right.
- ...the way I intended.

26:53.505 --> 26:57.243
So I just started, you know,
got into writing stuff,

26:57.276 --> 26:59.245

- What'd you write, man?

26:59.278 --> 27:02.248

you know.

27:02.281 --> 27:06.151
You ever hear of, uh,
Stick 'Em Up?

27:06.185 --> 27:07.419
- No.
- You never heard of that?

27:07.453 --> 27:09.555
- No.
- Crime drama.

27:09.588 --> 27:12.124
It's about this dude,
he be robbing people,

27:12.157 --> 27:15.527
he robbed the rich
and give to the poor.

27:15.561 --> 27:17.529
Poor, mainly him though.

27:17.563 --> 27:19.498
Oh, it's like...
like Robin Hood.

27:19.531 --> 27:22.501
Yeah, yeah, something...

27:22.534 --> 27:26.305
And then, you ever hear

27:26.338 --> 27:27.373
You heard of that?

27:27.406 --> 27:29.908
- You wrote that?
- No, no, I didn't write that,

27:29.942 --> 27:31.844
but I wrote something
similar to it,

27:31.877 --> 27:35.080

Little Miss Goodfoot.

27:35.114 --> 27:37.483

27:58.638 --> 28:01.974

28:57.596 --> 28:59.632
- I don't know, man.
- No, I'm just sayin'.

28:59.666 --> 29:01.233
Look, if you're worried
about bread,

29:01.266 --> 29:02.501
you ain't gotta pay me a dime.

29:02.534 --> 29:04.503
Just let a brother
get a little shine,

29:04.536 --> 29:07.272
that's all I ask,
just a little shine, playboy.

29:07.306 --> 29:10.142
- All right.

29:10.175 --> 29:13.479

I don't want no bread from you.

29:13.512 --> 29:14.781

29:14.814 --> 29:19.485
Well, it's... it's still just

29:21.654 --> 29:24.423
I mean, yeah, I mean,
we can talk about that.

29:24.456 --> 29:25.924
It's all good.

29:25.958 --> 29:28.227
Okay, yeah, cool.

29:28.260 --> 29:30.295
- That's what's up.
- Yeah.

29:31.597 --> 29:33.332
All right, there it is.

29:35.401 --> 29:36.669

- My room is... yeah.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, it sure is,

29:39.571 --> 29:40.372
it sure is.

29:40.406 --> 29:42.307
I think yours is
on the other side.

29:42.341 --> 29:44.076
- Yeah, nice bed set though.
- Thank you.

29:44.109 --> 29:46.278
Yeah, that IKEA shit dope.

30:01.026 --> 30:04.029
Um, can I help you?

30:04.062 --> 30:06.298
Matthew Hillard, I take it?

30:06.331 --> 30:07.533
Yeah?

30:08.567 --> 30:09.968
Um... you, uh,

30:10.002 --> 30:11.603
you here for like a signature?

30:11.638 --> 30:14.373
Are you doing like an interview
on me or something?

30:14.406 --> 30:16.108
No, my name is Lisa Cole.

30:16.141 --> 30:18.043
I'm here because
your mother hired me

30:18.076 --> 30:20.012
to help you
with your condition.

30:20.045 --> 30:22.514
Oh, no, I don't...
I don't have a condition.

30:22.548 --> 30:24.983
Yeah, so I don't...
I don't need any help.

30:25.017 --> 30:26.452
So you can just go, yeah.

30:26.485 --> 30:28.520
- Okay, sorry to bother you.
- No worries.

30:28.554 --> 30:30.289
I'm sorry you wasted your time.

30:30.322 --> 30:32.725
It's just that your mom
had purchased this package deal,

30:32.759 --> 30:33.726
and I'd really hate

30:33.760 --> 30:35.762
to just, you know,
take her money like that.

30:35.795 --> 30:38.030
Then just give it back.

30:38.063 --> 30:39.998
I can't just give it back.

30:40.032 --> 30:43.035
There's a no-refund policy,
so, sorry.

30:43.068 --> 30:44.704
But I know that if it was my mom

30:44.737 --> 30:46.305
who spent $3,000...

30:46.338 --> 30:47.707
Wait, hold up, 3,000?

30:47.740 --> 30:50.275
Of her personal, hard-earned
retirement savings...

30:50.309 --> 30:52.277
Okay, all right, all right.

30:52.311 --> 30:54.213
Damn, um...

30:54.246 --> 30:56.482
yeah, yeah, um,

30:56.515 --> 30:57.684
yeah, come on in,

30:57.717 --> 31:02.154
but just so you know,
I don't... I don't have a problem.

31:02.187 --> 31:04.323
Okay, fill that out.

31:05.324 --> 31:07.459
What the fuck?

31:11.798 --> 31:14.801
You... do you want some water
or some snacks or something?

31:14.834 --> 31:17.302
Oh, no, I'm fine,
but thanks for offering.

31:17.336 --> 31:18.303
Yeah.

31:21.841 --> 31:23.475
You should've took the snacks

31:23.509 --> 31:26.044
'cause you're not gonna get
anything else outta me.

31:26.078 --> 31:29.081
I pretty much put my whole life
down on those papers.

31:29.114 --> 31:30.683
Um, it's fine.

31:30.717 --> 31:33.252
I just want us to address
your condition

31:33.285 --> 31:35.053
so we can work
towards resolving it.

31:35.087 --> 31:36.756
Yeah, I don't...
I don't have a condition.

31:36.789 --> 31:38.557
I'm just fine.

31:38.590 --> 31:41.059
Okay, well, after speaking
with your mother

31:41.093 --> 31:43.128
and reviewing
your questionnaire,

31:43.161 --> 31:44.463
it's just as I figured.

31:44.496 --> 31:46.064
You suffer from agoraphobia,

31:46.098 --> 31:48.300
which is a fear of going outside

31:48.333 --> 31:49.802
due to trauma and loss.

31:49.836 --> 31:53.105
It affects 1.7%
of Americans in the U.S.

31:53.138 --> 31:56.208
This is your condition.

31:56.241 --> 31:59.111
Yeah, no, I don't...
I don't have agora...

31:59.144 --> 32:00.780
whatever it is you just said.

32:00.813 --> 32:02.782
I... I choose not to go outside.

32:02.815 --> 32:05.284
Just say it.

32:05.317 --> 32:08.353
"I can do it."

32:09.856 --> 32:11.791
Yeah, I don't think
this is gonna work.

32:16.261 --> 32:18.665
Because you don't think
that I can help.

32:22.869 --> 32:25.304
I really want to help people,

32:25.337 --> 32:27.774
and I try really hard
to help people,

32:27.807 --> 32:30.810
but, you know,
maybe I just suck at this.

32:30.843 --> 32:32.210
No, no, no, no, no, no.

32:32.244 --> 32:33.680
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:33.713 --> 32:35.682
You can help me, all right?

32:35.715 --> 32:37.249
It's okay.

32:42.521 --> 32:43.890
What the fuck is goin' on?

32:45.490 --> 32:46.893
I'm consoling my new friend,

32:46.926 --> 32:48.493
she was...
we're sitting here talking...

32:48.527 --> 32:50.329
we're talking about some stuff.

32:50.362 --> 32:51.496
Stuff?

32:52.699 --> 32:54.600
I've been gone
for less than 48 hours,

32:54.634 --> 32:56.803
and you're already hooking up
with somebody else.

32:56.836 --> 32:59.237
You... you hooked up
with someone else

32:59.271 --> 33:01.273
before we even broke up.

33:01.306 --> 33:03.542
Who is he, Sam?

33:03.575 --> 33:05.444
Is he a rock star?

33:05.477 --> 33:06.646
No.

33:06.679 --> 33:09.514
He's an actor,
if you must know.

33:09.548 --> 33:11.350
And you know what,
we met at an audition,

33:11.383 --> 33:12.852
and he took me out

33:12.885 --> 33:16.288
and made me feel
wanted and special,

33:16.321 --> 33:17.690
and, you know,
some other things

33:17.724 --> 33:19.291
I'm sure you can figure out
from the picture.

33:19.324 --> 33:21.928
- You're disgusting, Sam.
- You're pathetic.

33:22.962 --> 33:24.664
So, how'd you two meet?

33:24.697 --> 33:26.766
You know,
since he don't go outside.

33:26.799 --> 33:29.301
Oh... is she an escort?

33:29.334 --> 33:32.270
Have you been talking to Cedric?

33:32.304 --> 33:33.873
Okay, so I hate to intrude,

33:33.906 --> 33:35.642
but it sounds like you two
need to take...

33:35.675 --> 33:38.176
Can you please shut up?
Ain't nobody talking to you.

33:38.210 --> 33:40.278
All right, Sam, you don't
gotta talk to her like that.

33:40.312 --> 33:41.914
Okay, first of all,
I can talk to whoever I want,

33:41.948 --> 33:44.449
however I want,
when I want to, and nobo...

33:44.483 --> 33:45.685
One second, hold on one second.

33:45.718 --> 33:46.819
Hello?

33:46.853 --> 33:48.220
Hi!

33:48.253 --> 33:49.889
Mm-hmm.

33:49.922 --> 33:52.692
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah,
I'm on my way.

33:52.725 --> 33:54.426
Thank you.

33:54.459 --> 33:55.962
That was my agent.

33:55.995 --> 33:58.430
I have an audition to go to.

33:58.463 --> 34:01.768
I'll be back
to get my things though.

34:01.801 --> 34:03.936
Or I could just leave 'em
outside for you.

34:03.970 --> 34:05.872
Or burn them!

34:09.809 --> 34:12.611
I have no idea
how she has an agent.

34:12.645 --> 34:15.748
She has never booked
anything ever.

34:17.416 --> 34:18.718
Thanks for sticking up for me.

34:18.751 --> 34:20.385
Yeah, no problem.
Where were we?

34:20.419 --> 34:22.220
Me trying to help you.

34:22.254 --> 34:23.890
Yeah, let's do that,
let's do that.

34:23.923 --> 34:25.590
Okay, so, we're gonna start off

34:25.624 --> 34:27.960
with some breathing
and visualization exercises,

34:27.994 --> 34:29.428
so get comfortable.

34:29.461 --> 34:30.630
All right.

34:32.031 --> 34:34.266
Okay, now close your eyes.

34:34.299 --> 34:35.835
Take deep breaths.

34:38.004 --> 34:39.604
And one more.

34:43.442 --> 34:45.645
Now visualize
what you fear the most.

34:45.678 --> 34:47.914
Oh, no, I don't think
I wanna do that.

34:47.947 --> 34:49.916
- Okay, okay, too soon?
- Yeah.

34:49.949 --> 34:52.819
Okay, um,
we'll get there in time.

34:52.852 --> 34:54.419
Okay.

34:54.453 --> 34:55.855
You mind walking me to my car?

34:57.522 --> 35:00.459
I'm... I'm usually more
of a gentleman,

35:00.492 --> 35:03.395
but, uh, I hurt my leg, so...

35:06.032 --> 35:07.599
Okay.

35:10.402 --> 35:12.038
- Maybe next time.
- Yeah.

35:12.071 --> 35:13.305
Oh, God!

35:16.008 --> 35:17.309
Thank you.

35:22.915 --> 35:24.616
You're gonna be okay, Matt.

35:24.650 --> 35:25.952
It's gonna be okay.

35:25.985 --> 35:28.386
I'm gonna help you, I promise.

35:57.750 --> 36:01.854
"Agoraphobia
is an anxiety disorder."

36:07.827 --> 36:08.961
Hey, what's up, Ced?

36:08.995 --> 36:10.930
My man. What up, boy?

36:10.963 --> 36:15.802
Man, just... over here
doing some research.

36:15.835 --> 36:18.638
Oh, um, I got
a new writing partner.

36:18.671 --> 36:21.107
A writing partner? Who?

36:21.140 --> 36:23.810
Um, stand-up comedian
Norman Reed.

36:23.843 --> 36:26.078
You remember from
the Shaking Martini

36:26.112 --> 36:27.146
back in the day?

36:27.180 --> 36:29.816
- That guy's a writer?
- That's what he said.

36:29.849 --> 36:31.851
People say a lot of things,
Matt, listen,

36:31.884 --> 36:35.721
we got this deal on the table,
bro, okay?

36:35.755 --> 36:38.724
Big money we're talkin' about
right now.

36:38.758 --> 36:42.094
I told you, I'm focused on
making my film right now, man.

36:42.128 --> 36:44.831
I got the new writing partner.

36:44.864 --> 36:47.733
I'ma be rehearsing soon,
we're gonna start filming soon.

36:47.767 --> 36:49.802
I'm sorry, man, I just...

36:49.836 --> 36:51.838
I'm not doing the sequel.

36:51.871 --> 36:53.405
You know what, listen.

36:53.438 --> 36:55.507
I'll call you next week,
you know,

36:55.540 --> 36:58.010
we'll figure it all out
because I know your schedule

36:58.044 --> 37:00.412
is just busy right now,
and me too,

37:00.445 --> 37:01.914
so we'll talk about it
next week.

37:02.882 --> 37:05.117
All right.

37:05.151 --> 37:08.855
If the director of Tangerine
can do it,

37:08.888 --> 37:11.657
so can I.

37:11.691 --> 37:14.026
So that's how
you wanna play it, huh?

37:18.164 --> 37:19.632
I'm from the streets,

37:19.665 --> 37:21.566
and that's how we play it
over here, homie.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.069
Just because you're
from the streets

37:23.102 --> 37:25.938
don't mean you can't elevate
higher, my brother.

37:25.972 --> 37:28.573
As long as we in this land

37:28.607 --> 37:30.408
where they made us slaves,

37:30.442 --> 37:33.478
we ain't ever gonna be free!

37:38.651 --> 37:41.921
So that's how
you wanna play it, huh?

37:41.954 --> 37:45.691
I'm from the streets,
and that's how we...

37:45.725 --> 37:48.995
Clearly I gotta do
some rehearsing.

37:54.667 --> 37:56.702
Hey, Ma, what's up?

37:56.736 --> 38:01.674
Baby, I am just treating myself
to a luxurious, fantastic bath.

38:01.707 --> 38:02.975
It's gonna be awesome.
You know what?

38:03.009 --> 38:04.644
You should treat yourself
more often too.

38:04.677 --> 38:05.912
You should...
Are you okay, baby?

38:05.945 --> 38:09.849
Yeah, I'm just... I'm, uh,
I'm having some complications

38:09.882 --> 38:11.017
with the new movie.

38:12.251 --> 38:13.886
Ma, why did you...

38:13.920 --> 38:17.657
why did you hire me a therapist
and not tell me?

38:17.690 --> 38:19.926
- Huh?
- The therapist, Lisa.

38:19.959 --> 38:22.094
- Oh.
- Ma, I told you already,

38:22.128 --> 38:24.230
I don't need any help, okay?

38:24.263 --> 38:25.831
I'm good.

38:25.865 --> 38:26.999
Baby, I am so sorry.

38:27.033 --> 38:30.568
I didn't mean to intrude,
I just wanted to help you.

38:30.602 --> 38:31.804
Okay?

38:31.837 --> 38:34.140
Are you... are you okay?
Are you getting better?

38:34.173 --> 38:35.675
Is it helping?

38:35.708 --> 38:37.009
Yeah, yeah.

38:37.043 --> 38:38.177
A little bit.

38:39.979 --> 38:41.814
Well, that's good, right?

38:41.847 --> 38:44.016
I mean, soon you'll be able
to go outside

38:44.050 --> 38:45.851
and make real movies again.

38:45.885 --> 38:48.854
Ma, I am making
a real movie, Ma, I'm...

38:48.888 --> 38:50.189
You know, I don't...

38:50.222 --> 38:52.258
I don't have time for this
right now, all right?

38:52.291 --> 38:54.760
I just wanna let you know,
Mommy's so proud of you.

38:54.794 --> 38:57.263
And I love you so much. Okay?

38:57.296 --> 38:58.898
Do you love... wait.

39:00.066 --> 39:02.134
Sorry, baby, um,

39:02.168 --> 39:05.570
Mommy's gotta go, but, uh,
I will call you back, okay?

39:06.604 --> 39:07.605
I love you, baby.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.241
I gotta...

39:24.056 --> 39:25.623
Samantha,
what are you doing here?

39:25.658 --> 39:27.693
Well, I originally came
to get the rest of my things

39:27.727 --> 39:29.161
until my friend calls
and tells me

39:29.195 --> 39:30.629
that you're doing this?

39:30.663 --> 39:32.064
What the hell?

39:32.098 --> 39:33.833
I should've been
the first person you called

39:33.866 --> 39:35.001
when you decided
to do this, Matt.

39:35.034 --> 39:36.869
No, I didn't decide
to do anything.

39:36.902 --> 39:39.171
It's the Hollywood Reporter,
they don't print lies.

39:39.205 --> 39:41.173
You're doing Life's A Beach 2,
and I want in.

39:41.207 --> 39:42.441
But I'm not!

39:42.475 --> 39:46.112
Aight, and even if I was, why
would I put you in the movie?

39:46.145 --> 39:48.047
Because you love me, duh.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.548
But you cheated on me.

39:52.785 --> 39:54.720
Let's, you know...

39:54.754 --> 39:58.891
leave that in the past
and focus on the here and now.

40:00.026 --> 40:02.161
- The here and now...
- Mm-hmm.

40:02.194 --> 40:03.996
...is you getting your stuff

40:04.030 --> 40:07.299
that I already have packed
and ready for you

40:07.333 --> 40:09.001
and leaving me alone.

40:11.237 --> 40:13.005
Fine.

40:13.039 --> 40:15.307
I'll get my stuff and I'll go,

40:15.341 --> 40:19.145
but I'm not giving up
on us getting back together

40:19.178 --> 40:21.013
and me being a star.

40:21.047 --> 40:23.015
It's not happening.

40:24.817 --> 40:25.918
We'll see.

40:30.956 --> 40:33.259
Lord, please give my penis
the strength to resist

40:33.292 --> 40:35.261
this thirsty she-devil.

40:40.299 --> 40:42.034
So I'll, uh...

40:48.040 --> 40:49.742
...see you around, big boy.

40:54.847 --> 40:56.682
Oh, fuck me.

41:01.987 --> 41:03.289
Who is it?

41:03.322 --> 41:04.757
It's me, Dave, open up.

41:06.926 --> 41:08.160
What now, Dave?

41:08.194 --> 41:11.997
What now is the next step to me
kicking you the fuck outta here.

41:12.031 --> 41:13.699
This is for you.

41:13.732 --> 41:15.000
An eviction notice?

41:15.034 --> 41:17.103
Yeah, a motherfucking
eviction notice.

41:17.136 --> 41:18.838
You've been
motherfucking notified

41:18.871 --> 41:20.372
that I'm evicting
your bitch ass.

41:20.406 --> 41:21.807
This... this is crazy.

41:21.841 --> 41:23.809
I can just grab my checkbook
right now.

41:23.843 --> 41:25.678
- We can settle this.
- Are you serious?

41:25.711 --> 41:27.146
Fuck your checkbook.

41:27.179 --> 41:29.682
Fuck you,
you broke-ass motherfucker.

41:29.715 --> 41:32.351
Like, ooh, I can't wait
to kick you the fuck outta here.

41:32.384 --> 41:33.786
You so outta here!

41:39.391 --> 41:41.694
Hey, man, why did you put
that information

41:41.727 --> 41:44.096
about me doing the sequel
to Life's A Beach in the trades?

41:44.130 --> 41:47.099
Because I know you really want
to do the film,

41:47.133 --> 41:49.235
and you know you really want
to do the film.

41:49.268 --> 41:50.436
Me putting that info out, man,

41:50.469 --> 41:52.738
that's just your boy pushing you
in the right direction.

41:52.771 --> 41:54.807
Okay, okay, let...

41:54.840 --> 41:57.676
let's just say... let's just say
that I wanna do it,

41:57.710 --> 42:00.913
and I'm not saying that I do.

42:00.946 --> 42:03.382
How does that work with me
not being able to go outside?

42:03.415 --> 42:05.451
Matt, man, I don't know, okay?

42:05.484 --> 42:07.419
You take a look in the mirror
and you say,

42:07.453 --> 42:10.289
"Yo, I wanna make a movie,
I wanna make some money,

42:10.322 --> 42:12.758
I wanna go get a woman
who won't leave me,"

42:12.791 --> 42:14.426
and then you take your ass
out the house

42:14.460 --> 42:15.861
and you go do it, Matt.

42:15.895 --> 42:17.363
I don't know, man,
I'm not a shrink.

42:17.396 --> 42:19.732
- You figure it out.
- Dude, I'm trying, Ced.

42:19.765 --> 42:25.004
Matt, trying is for little kids
and for losers.

42:25.037 --> 42:26.839
You're a winner, man.

42:26.872 --> 42:28.240
Come on, Matt.

42:28.274 --> 42:31.043
Just make it happen.

42:31.076 --> 42:33.145
Come on, bro.

42:37.950 --> 42:40.219
Come on, baby, we're gonna be
late for the movie.

42:40.252 --> 42:41.820
Baby, I'm trying
to make a movie,

42:41.854 --> 42:43.455
you're trying to see a movie.

42:43.489 --> 42:45.191
And did you check into rehab?

42:49.061 --> 42:53.499
Day 480...

42:53.532 --> 42:56.435
and, uh,

42:56.468 --> 43:01.240
feels like I could be close
to, um...

43:01.273 --> 43:07.346
going back outside
and making films again.

43:07.379 --> 43:08.981
That'd be crazy, right?

43:10.916 --> 43:14.186
Speaking of,
let's see what's up

43:14.220 --> 43:18.490
with the other humans
in the outside world, right?

43:18.524 --> 43:21.060
Okay.

43:21.093 --> 43:22.761
Hey, guys, I'm back.

43:22.795 --> 43:25.231
Let's do some more comments,
all right?

43:25.264 --> 43:28.000
Uh, let's see, um,

43:28.033 --> 43:31.036
PJButter says,
"About damn time

43:31.070 --> 43:33.205
you get back to making
the magic happen."

43:33.239 --> 43:36.542
Uh, SusieQ says,
"I love you, Matt,

43:36.575 --> 43:40.913
and I can't wait to see
your new movie in theaters."

43:40.946 --> 43:42.781
SteveTheStabber says,

43:42.815 --> 43:44.984
"I'd better be in your film
or else."

43:46.819 --> 43:48.554
What the hell?

43:51.156 --> 43:54.526
I am gonna make this happen,
you guys.

43:54.560 --> 43:55.928
Okay.

43:59.598 --> 44:01.433
Hey, Norman, what's up, man?

44:01.467 --> 44:04.036
Don't "what's up" me.

44:04.069 --> 44:05.938
Are you mad at me?

44:05.971 --> 44:07.439
Hell yeah, I'm mad at your ass.

44:07.473 --> 44:09.408
How you gonna do the sequel
to Life's A Beach

44:09.441 --> 44:10.943
without even telling me
about it?

44:10.976 --> 44:12.444
I didn't tell you or anyone

44:12.478 --> 44:14.513
because I didn't even know
if I was doing it or not.

44:14.546 --> 44:16.382
All right, I still don't know.

44:16.415 --> 44:18.384
My producer's trying
to persuade me to do it

44:18.417 --> 44:20.452
'cause the studio wants
to pay him to make it.

44:20.486 --> 44:22.221
Now I'm even more mad
at your ass!

44:22.254 --> 44:24.390
How you not gonna do
the sequel with the studio

44:24.423 --> 44:25.924
and get me involved
with the shit?

44:25.958 --> 44:27.059
I'm sorry, man!

44:27.092 --> 44:28.394
I'm trying to do
something different

44:28.427 --> 44:29.561
with this film I'm making.

44:29.595 --> 44:31.430
Something different with the...

44:31.463 --> 44:34.166
You talking about the film
where you in here by yourself

44:34.199 --> 44:35.467
with your own thoughts?

44:35.501 --> 44:36.969
That film you talking about?

44:37.002 --> 44:38.404
Yes, that one.

44:38.437 --> 44:40.906
You out your motherfuckin' mind!

44:40.939 --> 44:43.242
I think it has potential, man.

44:43.275 --> 44:45.377
And you told me
you would help me with it.

44:45.411 --> 44:49.248
I... I... I will help...

44:49.281 --> 44:51.150
Let me... let me see
the bullshit-ass script

44:51.183 --> 44:52.885
real quick and see
what you working with.

44:52.918 --> 44:54.486
Goddamn it.

44:54.520 --> 44:58.057
...we in this land
where they made us slaves,

44:58.090 --> 45:02.394
we ain't ever gon' be free!

45:02.428 --> 45:05.964
What in the entire fuck is this?

45:05.998 --> 45:07.599
You don't like it?

45:07.634 --> 45:09.568
I don't even know
what the fuck it is not to like.

45:09.601 --> 45:11.503
It makes no sense whatsoever.

45:11.537 --> 45:14.540
No, I was... I was trying to,
you know, film a movie

45:14.573 --> 45:16.643
that takes place at my house.

45:16.676 --> 45:18.544
Interesting, right, so I just...

45:18.577 --> 45:21.447
I created, like,
all these crazy scenarios

45:21.480 --> 45:23.315
and crazy characters.

45:23.349 --> 45:27.119
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
this shit is wack as fuck, no.

45:27.152 --> 45:29.188
You gotta make this sexy
and make it cool

45:29.221 --> 45:30.956
and exciting and shit.

45:30.989 --> 45:33.392
Look, check this out,
so you got this woman, right?

45:33.425 --> 45:35.394
She fine as hell, right,
and she's in this kitchen

45:35.427 --> 45:38.030
cooking, right,
and she cooking naked,

45:38.063 --> 45:39.264
but she cooking, like,
frying something,

45:39.298 --> 45:41.166
and then the grease pop on her,

45:41.200 --> 45:43.402
and make her shake,
she knock the skillet over

45:43.435 --> 45:45.638
into the fire,
now there's fire everywhere

45:45.672 --> 45:48.107
- and she gotta try to escape...
- No, I don't... I don't know

45:48.140 --> 45:49.441
about the fire thing.

45:49.475 --> 45:51.410
That sounds, like, dangerous.

45:51.443 --> 45:53.212
Oh, nah, nah, nah,
you gotta think Hollywood,

45:53.245 --> 45:55.147
brother, like,
they don't use real fire.

45:55.180 --> 45:57.049
Nobody in Hollywood
uses real fire,

45:57.082 --> 45:59.585
- just it's fake fire.
- No, none of that in this movie.

45:59.618 --> 46:02.254
- Okay.
- It's just... it takes place here,

46:02.287 --> 46:04.189
and like none of the characters
even leave the house, so.

46:04.223 --> 46:07.259
Okay, that's cool, that's cool...
okay, check this out, look.

46:07.292 --> 46:09.361
So, it's these bums,
right, and they...

46:09.395 --> 46:11.563
and they like martial artists,

46:11.597 --> 46:13.932
but people don't know,
and they be like, like,

46:13.966 --> 46:15.434
fucking with them on the street,

46:15.467 --> 46:18.003
and they be folding
these motherfuckers,

46:18.036 --> 46:20.339
like with, like,
these moves that they got,

46:20.372 --> 46:22.341
like... like the cardboard,

46:22.374 --> 46:25.978
- and the shopping cart.
- Yeah, that sounds ridiculous.

46:26.011 --> 46:29.314
So, just that doesn't even
make any sense.

46:29.348 --> 46:32.518
Oh, no,
this motherfucker's ridiculous.

46:32.551 --> 46:35.587
What you need to be working on
is the sequel to Life's A Beach,

46:35.621 --> 46:37.156
instead of writing
this bullshit.

46:37.189 --> 46:39.258
I'm still working on it,
it's gonna get better,

46:39.291 --> 46:41.093
I'm just focusing
on this right now, so.

46:41.126 --> 46:43.529
You still don't get it.

46:43.562 --> 46:46.298
No, you burn this motherfucker,

46:46.331 --> 46:48.267
like, I will give you
the lighter fluid

46:48.300 --> 46:50.202
and the matches
to burn this motherfucker.

46:50.235 --> 46:52.604
I don't ever wanna see
this shit ever again.

46:52.639 --> 46:54.206
This shit is sickening,
do you hear me?

46:54.239 --> 46:56.508
So, like,
actual lighter fluid?

46:56.542 --> 46:59.445
I'm talking...
real fire this time.

46:59.478 --> 47:00.713
- Real this time?
- You get what I'm saying?

47:00.747 --> 47:03.015
Burn this
with real fire this time.

47:03.048 --> 47:05.584
- Okay.
- All this talk about burn,

47:05.617 --> 47:07.219
I'm ready to smoke.

47:07.252 --> 47:08.520
Shit.

47:08.554 --> 47:10.222
That's what I think
I'm gonna go do.

47:10.255 --> 47:12.024
I'm gonna smoke a little bit.

47:12.057 --> 47:15.360
Now, if you wanna
go clear your head,

47:15.394 --> 47:17.262
and go see some real titties,

47:17.296 --> 47:20.132
and, uh...

47:20.165 --> 47:22.735
Yeah, I'm... I'm good.

47:22.769 --> 47:24.704
- Maybe another time we can...
- Nah, nah,

47:24.737 --> 47:27.339
you need to see these, though,
these is real titties, like...

47:27.372 --> 47:29.676
Yeah, I'm... I know
you're not a fan of this,

47:29.709 --> 47:32.277
but I'm just gonna
focus on that

47:32.311 --> 47:35.614
and try to fix it up
a little bit.

47:35.648 --> 47:38.517
If you keep working on this,
I promise you,

47:38.550 --> 47:40.352
your life
is gonna be a disaster.

47:40.385 --> 47:42.588
- Okay.
- Okay.

47:48.761 --> 47:51.330
You brought me a plant.

47:51.363 --> 47:53.298
That's so thoughtful of you.

47:53.332 --> 47:55.234
It's something from the outside.

47:58.136 --> 48:00.707
Like, I kinda already have one,
but that's... it's cool,

48:00.740 --> 48:03.743
it's beau... it's beautiful,
thank you.

48:03.776 --> 48:07.647
Well, I have
something else for you, too.

48:10.382 --> 48:12.752
Close your eyes, feel the sand.

48:12.785 --> 48:15.254
Okay.

48:19.291 --> 48:21.093
How do you feel?

48:25.397 --> 48:27.366
Free.

48:33.806 --> 48:36.241
So what did you think of?

48:36.275 --> 48:39.411
A place I miss very much.

48:39.444 --> 48:41.113
The beach,

48:41.146 --> 48:43.650
because life's a beach, right?

48:46.151 --> 48:47.720
Wait, you've seen my movie?

48:47.754 --> 48:50.289
Yeah, it's one of my favorites.

48:50.322 --> 48:52.792
But you acted like
you didn't know who I was.

48:52.825 --> 48:54.861
Because I wanted
to be professional,

48:54.894 --> 48:57.362
and not come off like a groupie.

48:57.396 --> 48:59.164
I see.

48:59.197 --> 49:02.467
So, the meditation worked.

49:02.501 --> 49:05.337
Now, are you ready
to talk about what happened

49:05.370 --> 49:07.205
- that caused your...
- Condition?

49:07.239 --> 49:10.108
Nah, no, fuck that.

49:10.142 --> 49:12.779
'Kay, well, just so you know,

49:12.812 --> 49:16.181
you overcoming your fear
enables you to empower others

49:16.214 --> 49:19.318
to be inspired by your victory.

49:19.351 --> 49:22.487
Kinda sound like
a really wordy fortune cookie.

49:24.222 --> 49:26.625
Well, thanks, I guess.

49:26.659 --> 49:30.228
I love Chinese food, so it was
most definitely a compliment.

49:32.799 --> 49:35.601
So, would you wanna
talk about your break up?

49:35.635 --> 49:39.137
I mean, you guys
did break up, right?

49:39.171 --> 49:40.807
Yeah.

49:42.608 --> 49:43.910
So, how are you handling that?

49:43.943 --> 49:46.545
I don't really
wanna talk about that.

49:46.578 --> 49:48.781
I mean, when does anybody
ever really wanna

49:48.815 --> 49:51.483
talk about their break up?

49:51.516 --> 49:53.452
I get it.

49:53.485 --> 49:56.221
And I've been through
a lot of really bad break ups,

49:56.254 --> 49:58.390
and I don't wanna
talk about 'em either.

50:00.359 --> 50:02.895
You know, and I just
sit and think about 'em,

50:02.929 --> 50:06.531
and how I'm all alone.

50:06.565 --> 50:08.300
Sometimes it makes me wanna cry.

50:11.236 --> 50:12.905
Wait, are you
really crying right now?

50:12.939 --> 50:14.941
Or is this... is this just an act?

50:16.843 --> 50:20.379
No, it's... it's my condition.

50:20.412 --> 50:21.914
Your condition?

50:21.948 --> 50:26.686
Yeah, I suffer from
emotional hypersensitivity.

50:26.719 --> 50:28.788
What the hell is that?

50:28.821 --> 50:31.590
It's when you're
overly sensitive

50:31.623 --> 50:34.559
and emotionally fragile.

50:34.593 --> 50:38.430
The symptoms are more extreme
emotional responses,

50:38.463 --> 50:39.966
and a heightened sense
of self awareness

50:39.999 --> 50:43.402
compared to others.

50:43.435 --> 50:45.638
And I thought about all that
and was like,

50:45.672 --> 50:47.272
"Make a perfect therapist."

50:48.975 --> 50:50.977
Well, I should be going.

50:51.010 --> 50:54.212
I have to go see my therapist.

50:54.246 --> 50:56.481
Thank you.

51:09.528 --> 51:12.330
- Hey, Ced.
- Matt, what the fuck?

51:12.364 --> 51:15.001
- Where you been, bro?
- I've been going through a lot

51:15.034 --> 51:16.669
- lately, man.
- I know it's hard

51:16.703 --> 51:18.503
to jump back in the ring
after everything that happened,

51:18.537 --> 51:20.940
but you gotta do this, man.

51:20.973 --> 51:24.409
I get it, I get it,
and I appreciate the push, man,

51:24.443 --> 51:26.311
and I'm working on it.

51:26.344 --> 51:29.782
All right, so just give me
the info for the meeting

51:29.816 --> 51:31.651
- and I will be there.
- Matt, I knew

51:31.684 --> 51:33.786
you was gonna come through.

51:33.820 --> 51:36.656
That's what I'm talking about,
all right look, um,

51:36.689 --> 51:39.424
the meeting's coming up
real soon, man, okay, real soon.

51:39.458 --> 51:42.594
- I'm counting on you.
- Yeah, no, no, no, I got you.

51:42.627 --> 51:46.331
My boy, all right, let's do it.

51:46.364 --> 51:48.233
All right.

52:18.664 --> 52:21.667
Hey there, Matt, what the fuck
is up with that call back?

52:21.701 --> 52:23.770
Hey, Matt.

52:23.803 --> 52:27.305
Oh, let me inside
so I can stab you in the head!

52:27.339 --> 52:28.674
You're fucking dead!

52:28.708 --> 52:30.575
You fucking lying cocksucker!

52:32.511 --> 52:34.546
Don't let me catch you
in the streets, fucker.

52:34.579 --> 52:36.983
You're a fucking dead man.

52:37.016 --> 52:39.652
Do you hear me, Matt?

53:04.911 --> 53:06.611
Have you been in bed all day?

53:06.646 --> 53:07.947
I have to pee.

53:07.980 --> 53:09.882
Oh, you have a Skype call
coming in.

53:11.918 --> 53:13.686
Hi, Matt.

53:13.719 --> 53:16.889
Hi, baby, how are you?

53:16.923 --> 53:18.356
Hey, I just wanted
to check on you

53:18.390 --> 53:20.358
and see how you're doing.

53:20.392 --> 53:22.594
You know what, Lisa says
you're making progress.

53:22.627 --> 53:25.898
Yeah, Ma, I can't really
talk about that right now.

53:25.932 --> 53:27.900
You don't look so good,
are you okay?

53:27.934 --> 53:29.869
Yeah, Ma, Lisa's actually here.

53:29.902 --> 53:31.037
That's... she just went
to the bathroom,

53:31.070 --> 53:32.470
that's why I answered.

53:32.504 --> 53:33.906
Yeah, I gotta go, Ma.

53:33.940 --> 53:35.675
Okay, okay, that's okay, okay.

53:35.708 --> 53:38.010
- I love you, I love you.
- All right, I love you too, Ma.

53:40.412 --> 53:42.815
Sorry about that, I've been
drinking a lot of water,

53:42.849 --> 53:44.750
and haven't had
a cry in a while,

53:44.784 --> 53:47.053
so been having to pee a lot.

53:47.086 --> 53:49.421
Is, uh... is oversharing

53:49.454 --> 53:52.424
one of the symptoms
of your condition?

53:52.457 --> 53:54.126
I mean, it wasn't on
the original list.

53:57.163 --> 53:59.799
So, anything new
you wanna talk about?

53:59.832 --> 54:01.433
It's...

54:01.466 --> 54:03.636
It's just right...
right when you think

54:03.669 --> 54:06.138
everything is gonna be okay,

54:06.172 --> 54:08.440
something happens,

54:08.473 --> 54:11.376
and it's just like,
"Nope, not happening."

54:12.778 --> 54:15.081
What happened?

54:15.114 --> 54:16.983
Motherfuckers be crazy.

54:19.185 --> 54:22.587
I don't get it, did someone
try to do something to you?

54:22.621 --> 54:24.690
Well, some... some...
someone is always,

54:24.724 --> 54:27.827
always trying to do
something to someone,

54:27.860 --> 54:30.930
because... because there's a lot
of crazy people out there.

54:30.963 --> 54:34.634
You want me to go out there
so I can die.

54:34.667 --> 54:37.535
I don't want you to go
out there so you can die.

54:37.569 --> 54:39.038
I want you to go out there
so you can live.

54:39.071 --> 54:41.606
- I thought you wanted that, too.
- Oh, no, I do wanna live,

54:41.641 --> 54:44.110
and that's exactly
what I'm doing right here,

54:44.143 --> 54:46.045
just safe and sound.

54:46.078 --> 54:47.545
No, you're not.

54:47.579 --> 54:49.081
This is not life, Matt.

54:49.115 --> 54:50.917
You do know that, right?

54:50.950 --> 54:52.919
Why am I sitting here
arguing with you?

54:52.952 --> 54:54.687
Lisa, I'm... I'm sorry.

54:54.720 --> 54:56.756
This... this just
isn't gonna work.

54:56.789 --> 54:59.792
All right, I just... I think
maybe you should just go.

54:59.825 --> 55:02.560
You don't think
this is gonna work?

55:02.594 --> 55:04.897
'Cause I really believe
that we're making progress.

55:04.931 --> 55:06.832
I told your mother

55:06.866 --> 55:08.234
that we were making progress.

55:08.267 --> 55:10.169
Please don't make me out
to be a liar.

55:10.202 --> 55:12.104
Please don't... don't cry.

55:12.138 --> 55:14.707
I'm not, I'll just go.

55:14.740 --> 55:16.042
Come on.

55:16.075 --> 55:18.476
No, thank you, I will be fine.

55:28.254 --> 55:30.622
Yo, Matt, what's going on, man?

55:30.656 --> 55:32.058
The clock is ticking.

55:32.091 --> 55:33.591
Stop dicking around
and call me back, bro.

55:33.625 --> 55:36.095
We gotta make this deal happen.

55:38.230 --> 55:40.565
Matt, I've been trying
to FaceTime with you,

55:40.598 --> 55:43.169
but you haven't been logging on
and answering my calls.

55:43.202 --> 55:45.738
Is everything okay?

55:45.771 --> 55:49.008
Hi, Matt, just calling to see
how you're holding up,

55:49.041 --> 55:51.711
and to say you do have
the strength to face your fears

55:51.744 --> 55:53.679
and get back out there.

55:53.713 --> 55:55.681
If you need someone to talk to,

55:55.715 --> 55:56.983
I'm here for you.

56:00.319 --> 56:01.821
Hey, babe.

56:12.564 --> 56:14.100
So, uh,

56:14.133 --> 56:16.534
you gonna tell me
what's going on with you?

56:18.337 --> 56:19.939
No.

56:23.242 --> 56:24.844
You know you can do
whatever you wanna do

56:24.877 --> 56:26.278
whenever you wanna do it?

56:30.683 --> 56:33.285
I heard the stories about you,

56:33.319 --> 56:36.088
and I get it, that was some
fucked up shit that went down.

56:38.090 --> 56:39.692
- But that's life.
- Look, I don't...

56:39.725 --> 56:41.794
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Fine, yeah,

56:41.827 --> 56:45.563
you ain't gotta talk about it.

56:45.597 --> 56:49.135
So, what you gonna do,
just let your life go by?

56:49.168 --> 56:50.669
Yep.

56:50.703 --> 56:52.204
Mm-hm.

56:54.373 --> 56:56.776
You can't do that.

56:56.809 --> 56:58.911
You got to get up, get out,

56:58.944 --> 57:00.980
and make something happen
for yourself.

57:03.082 --> 57:05.351
And when you succeed,

57:05.384 --> 57:07.219
I want 10 percent
of everything you get.

57:07.253 --> 57:09.055
Okay.

57:11.390 --> 57:14.360
Now, you get up and you get
your shit together,

57:14.393 --> 57:17.329
before I make it 15 percent.

57:17.363 --> 57:19.632
Oh, you gonna roll your eyes
over 20 percent?

57:21.400 --> 57:23.869
Better be happy
and give me that 25 percent.

57:23.903 --> 57:26.005
Thank you, okay.

57:26.038 --> 57:27.605
Tripping over 30 percent.

57:27.640 --> 57:29.607
It's not... like,
we're not even negotiating

57:29.642 --> 57:31.010
- or anything.
- 35.

57:47.927 --> 57:49.395
Oh, no, Samantha,
why are you here?

57:49.428 --> 57:51.630
- You already got all your stuff.
- No, I didn't.

57:51.664 --> 57:53.299
I checked, you did.

57:53.332 --> 57:55.134
Well, you're mine, too,

57:55.167 --> 57:59.672
so I came back...
for you.

57:59.705 --> 58:01.941
I'm not really trying
to do this with you right now,

58:01.974 --> 58:03.809
or ever again.

58:03.843 --> 58:06.779
We're over, Samantha.

58:11.817 --> 58:13.252
Are you sure
you don't wanna get that?

58:13.285 --> 58:14.753
Mm-mm.

58:14.787 --> 58:17.890
Could be an audition,
maybe even a call back.

58:17.923 --> 58:20.192
This could be your big break.

58:20.226 --> 58:22.161
My big break is right
in front of my face.

58:24.096 --> 58:26.265
That's typical.

58:26.298 --> 58:28.934
All this is just about
you getting what you want.

58:28.968 --> 58:30.836
Matt, what I want

58:30.870 --> 58:32.438
is a second chance,

58:32.471 --> 58:34.240
and I think after everything
I've been through with you,

58:34.273 --> 58:35.841
I deserve it.

58:35.875 --> 58:38.944
I... I didn't force you to stay.

58:38.978 --> 58:40.913
I... I'm sorry

58:40.946 --> 58:43.282
that I was so fucked up
'cause I experienced

58:43.315 --> 58:46.051
some really fucked up shit,
but you could've walked away

58:46.085 --> 58:49.421
- at any time.
- Okay, but I didn't want to.

58:49.455 --> 58:51.390
I loved you,

58:51.423 --> 58:54.994
and I wanted to be there
for you, and I fucked up.

58:55.027 --> 58:56.328
All right, but,

58:56.362 --> 58:58.864
baby, who cares?

58:58.898 --> 59:00.900
I can change, you can change.

59:00.933 --> 59:03.068
We can have a fresh, new start,
we can be that power couple

59:03.102 --> 59:06.305
we always thought we could be,
you know, like Will and Jada.

59:06.338 --> 59:07.740
- No.
- Yeah.

59:15.514 --> 59:17.249
Fuck it.

59:20.186 --> 59:22.755
- No, Samantha, no.
- What?

59:22.788 --> 59:25.124
- No, this is not happening.
- No?

59:25.157 --> 59:27.726
You know, I know you're used to
getting your way all the time,

59:27.760 --> 59:30.329
- but not this time.
- Not this time?

59:30.362 --> 59:32.131
Oh, shit.

59:35.868 --> 59:38.237
- Look, Samantha, listen.
- Hm, what?

59:41.907 --> 59:43.209
Baby, don't worry about that,
just forget about it.

59:43.242 --> 59:44.743
It's just me and you,
just focus on me.

59:44.777 --> 59:46.278
I'll be right there.

59:46.312 --> 59:49.248
Okay, seriously, get off.

59:51.850 --> 59:53.152
Hey.

59:53.185 --> 59:55.254
Chris, what are you doing here?

59:55.287 --> 59:57.089
Didn't I tell you
to wait in the car?

59:57.122 --> 59:59.191
And I was, but I got
a call from my agent

59:59.225 --> 1:00:01.427
about a last-minute audition.

1:00:01.460 --> 1:00:03.195
What the hell is going on here?

1:00:03.229 --> 1:00:04.830
I thought you said that
you were picking up something

1:00:04.863 --> 1:00:06.465
from your parents,
and what's with this text

1:00:06.498 --> 1:00:08.867
about I can just leave?

1:00:08.901 --> 1:00:10.169
And who is this guy?

1:00:12.037 --> 1:00:14.039
Chris, is it?

1:00:14.073 --> 1:00:16.442
Yeah, and you are?

1:00:16.475 --> 1:00:18.744
Matt Hillard.

1:00:20.546 --> 1:00:24.383
Wait, writer and director
of Life's A Beach?

1:00:24.416 --> 1:00:25.951
That's me.

1:00:25.985 --> 1:00:27.419
Holy shit.

1:00:27.453 --> 1:00:30.522
Yo, that is my shit,
I fucking love that movie, man,

1:00:30.556 --> 1:00:33.926
and word is... word is
you're doing a sequel.

1:00:33.959 --> 1:00:35.861
All right, if you are,
I gotta get in on an audition

1:00:35.894 --> 1:00:37.930
for that, right, because...

1:00:37.963 --> 1:00:40.366
Wait, is... is that
what this is about?

1:00:40.399 --> 1:00:43.002
You were trying to come
audition for him on the low?

1:00:43.035 --> 1:00:45.371
That's exactly
what this is about.

1:00:45.404 --> 1:00:49.475
Yeah, I, um,
just didn't wanna tell you

1:00:49.508 --> 1:00:51.443
unless I got the part.

1:00:51.477 --> 1:00:54.813
Babe, how you just
gonna try to sneak

1:00:54.847 --> 1:00:57.850
and get this opportunity
on the low by yourself?

1:00:57.883 --> 1:01:00.419
I thought we were
in this together.

1:01:00.452 --> 1:01:03.122
I mean, this isn't you trying
to sleep your way in, is it?

1:01:03.155 --> 1:01:06.392
No, no, I'm not
that kind of person.

1:01:06.425 --> 1:01:09.328
I wanna make it on my talent
and my talent alone.

1:01:09.361 --> 1:01:10.829
- Okay.
- You know?

1:01:10.863 --> 1:01:13.132
Well, Matt,
did she get the part?

1:01:13.165 --> 1:01:14.967
Hey, can I audition,
too, actually,

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.436
- 'cause I got chops.
- No, not... I don't know, man.

1:01:17.469 --> 1:01:20.039
I don't... I... you know, I gotta
consult with my producers,

1:01:20.072 --> 1:01:21.974
my casting director,
you know how it is.

1:01:22.007 --> 1:01:25.010
Oh yeah, okay, but hey, look,

1:01:25.044 --> 1:01:27.980
- don't forget about me, man.
- No.

1:01:29.615 --> 1:01:32.251
Okay, but seriously, Sam,
I gotta get to this audition.

1:01:32.284 --> 1:01:34.453
- Let's go.
- Hey, Chris, can we...

1:01:34.486 --> 1:01:36.455
can we get a quick minute?

1:01:38.590 --> 1:01:40.993
It's fine, yeah, yeah.

1:01:41.026 --> 1:01:42.461
But, Sam, if you're not in
the car in five minutes,

1:01:42.494 --> 1:01:45.397
I'm out, all right,
and yo, Matt,

1:01:45.431 --> 1:01:46.899
I'm glad you're back.

1:01:46.932 --> 1:01:48.233
- Keep doing your thing, man.
- Yes, sir.

1:01:48.267 --> 1:01:50.502
- Keep doing your thing.
- Yes, sir.

1:01:50.536 --> 1:01:52.104
Matt Hillard.

1:01:58.210 --> 1:02:01.347
I knew that you still loved me.

1:02:03.115 --> 1:02:04.983
That's just it,

1:02:05.017 --> 1:02:06.618
I don't.

1:02:06.653 --> 1:02:08.620
Bullshit.

1:02:08.655 --> 1:02:10.389
Why would you just
cover for me then?

1:02:10.422 --> 1:02:13.959
'Cause I didn't want that guy
to feel what I felt.

1:02:13.992 --> 1:02:16.195
Maybe, maybe
I just want you to see

1:02:16.228 --> 1:02:18.997
how fucked up you really are,

1:02:19.031 --> 1:02:21.033
and unless you
completely change,

1:02:21.066 --> 1:02:23.268
you just gonna keep
fucking things up

1:02:23.302 --> 1:02:26.338
for yourself and everyone else.

1:02:26.372 --> 1:02:28.507
Fuck you, Matt.

1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:32.144
Samantha, I really think
you should get some help.

1:02:32.177 --> 1:02:34.179
Like professional help.

1:02:34.213 --> 1:02:36.448
I should get some help?

1:02:36.482 --> 1:02:38.183
You, of all people,
are telling me

1:02:38.217 --> 1:02:40.452
I should get some help,
that I'm crazy?

1:02:40.486 --> 1:02:43.489
Right, you're right.

1:02:43.522 --> 1:02:46.225
I'm crazy for thinking that
you could ever make me happy.

1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:50.429
Fuck this.

1:02:50.462 --> 1:02:53.098
And fuck you, too, Matt.

1:03:10.382 --> 1:03:13.118
I really appreciate
you stopping by.

1:03:13.152 --> 1:03:15.421
I've been meaning
to call you and apologize

1:03:15.454 --> 1:03:17.222
for what happened last time.

1:03:18.758 --> 1:03:20.492
Just wanted to make sure
that you were okay,

1:03:20.526 --> 1:03:22.695
and it's cool.

1:03:22.729 --> 1:03:24.363
I'm sure that with everything
that you've been going through,

1:03:24.396 --> 1:03:26.165
it's just a lot to deal with.

1:03:26.198 --> 1:03:28.534
No, it is, but that's...

1:03:28.567 --> 1:03:32.104
that's no excuse.

1:03:32.137 --> 1:03:34.973
So, how you been?

1:03:35.007 --> 1:03:36.709
Up and down.

1:03:36.743 --> 1:03:39.746
You know, um,

1:03:39.779 --> 1:03:42.649
I... I do feel like
we were making progress.

1:03:44.316 --> 1:03:48.253
Then, um...
then something happened.

1:03:48.287 --> 1:03:50.422
What happened?

1:03:50.456 --> 1:03:52.291
I don't really
wanna talk about it.

1:03:54.661 --> 1:03:57.029
Did you fall off a cliff?

1:03:57.062 --> 1:04:00.265
- No.
- Get hit by a car?

1:04:00.299 --> 1:04:03.101
- No.
- Shot in the line of duty?

1:04:03.135 --> 1:04:04.603
No.

1:04:04.637 --> 1:04:08.240
So, what is it?

1:04:08.273 --> 1:04:10.609
I just don't wanna
talk about it, I'm sorry.

1:04:10.643 --> 1:04:13.178
So, clearly I'm failing at this,
so I'm just gonna go.

1:04:13.212 --> 1:04:15.547
No, all right, okay,
I'm... I'm sorry.

1:04:19.719 --> 1:04:22.387
All right, I... I had this guy

1:04:22.421 --> 1:04:25.190
audition for my movie.

1:04:25.224 --> 1:04:26.726
Steven Vendetti.

1:04:29.127 --> 1:04:33.398
And he came by my place recently
and he threatened me.

1:04:33.432 --> 1:04:36.368
If he wasn't a threat anymore,
would that help you?

1:04:36.401 --> 1:04:38.437
Yeah, yeah.

1:04:38.470 --> 1:04:40.138
Yeah, that... that would...

1:04:40.172 --> 1:04:42.474
Yeah, that'd make me feel
a lot safer actually.

1:04:44.409 --> 1:04:46.713
Yeah, I could,
I don't know, like...

1:04:46.746 --> 1:04:49.414
Could what?

1:04:49.448 --> 1:04:51.583
Get back to making movies again.

1:04:51.617 --> 1:04:53.218
I don't know, like,

1:04:53.252 --> 1:04:56.255
take a stroll maybe.

1:04:56.288 --> 1:04:58.090
Outside.

1:04:59.859 --> 1:05:02.327
With you.

1:05:08.300 --> 1:05:09.434
What is it, is it my breath?

1:05:09.468 --> 1:05:12.404
Uh, no, I just have to pee,

1:05:12.437 --> 1:05:14.206
but all this sounds
really great, Matt.

1:05:14.239 --> 1:05:16.241
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, okay.

1:05:22.614 --> 1:05:24.851
You know what, I'm gonna go.

1:05:24.884 --> 1:05:27.152
- Are you okay?
- No.

1:05:27.185 --> 1:05:28.520
I'm just gonna leave,
and you should

1:05:28.554 --> 1:05:30.556
probably clean up,
your place is a mess right now.

1:05:30.589 --> 1:05:32.424
Wait, I'm confused, I thought
you said you had to pee.

1:05:32.457 --> 1:05:35.594
I do, I mean, I did,
but now I'm gonna go.

1:05:35.627 --> 1:05:37.764
- Wait, are you crying?
- It's my allergies.

1:05:37.797 --> 1:05:39.331
Wait, it's not your emotional
hypersensitivity thing?

1:05:39.364 --> 1:05:41.466
- No, allergies.
- Wait, Lisa, come on.

1:05:41.500 --> 1:05:43.268
What did... what did I do?

1:05:59.618 --> 1:06:01.721
Oh, fuck.

1:06:07.225 --> 1:06:09.862
Hey, you've reached Lisa,
leave a message.

1:06:09.896 --> 1:06:11.698
Lisa, Lisa,

1:06:11.731 --> 1:06:14.767
please come back, please,
I... I can explain everything,

1:06:14.801 --> 1:06:17.135
just... or just call me.

1:06:17.169 --> 1:06:18.570
Please.

1:08:04.443 --> 1:08:06.311
To my son.

1:08:06.344 --> 1:08:08.748
You're 18 years young this day,

1:08:08.781 --> 1:08:11.984
and your life is just
really starting to begin.

1:08:12.018 --> 1:08:13.820
Now, I know there's a lot
of things that you wanna do,

1:08:13.853 --> 1:08:17.990
and despite all the challenges
that you may endure,

1:08:18.024 --> 1:08:20.827
I still support you, son.

1:08:20.860 --> 1:08:23.395
Just when you make it big,
please retire me

1:08:23.428 --> 1:08:25.965
and your mother.

1:08:25.998 --> 1:08:28.835
And no matter
what happens in life, son,

1:08:28.868 --> 1:08:31.470
keep following your dreams.

1:08:31.503 --> 1:08:33.740
Love, your Dad.

1:08:51.389 --> 1:08:54.359
We always did
have the good stuff.

1:09:36.401 --> 1:09:40.305
Day 498.

1:09:42.742 --> 1:09:44.777
And, um,

1:09:44.811 --> 1:09:48.047
it seems like I was almost free,

1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:49.916
but nope.

1:09:49.949 --> 1:09:51.751
No.

1:09:51.784 --> 1:09:54.720
No, this place... this place
is gonna be the place

1:09:54.754 --> 1:09:58.724
I'm gonna be at until
Dave's punk ass kicks me out.

1:10:02.829 --> 1:10:06.866
Man, I... I fucking hate
that guy, man.

1:10:11.838 --> 1:10:13.639
But, I love Lisa.

1:10:15.574 --> 1:10:18.978
And she left me, she left me
because of Samantha.

1:10:22.414 --> 1:10:24.616
That woman is out of my life

1:10:24.650 --> 1:10:28.120
and she's still ruining it.

1:10:28.154 --> 1:10:29.822
What?

1:10:29.856 --> 1:10:32.490
That is some really bad juju.

1:10:35.695 --> 1:10:37.596
And my mom... my mom
tried to help me,

1:10:37.630 --> 1:10:40.532
but it doesn't fucking matter.

1:10:40.565 --> 1:10:43.401
Nothing matters.

1:10:43.435 --> 1:10:45.137
Doesn't matter.

1:10:45.171 --> 1:10:47.372
Except my dreams.

1:10:49.809 --> 1:10:52.945
But now all I'm living
are these nightmares.

1:10:52.979 --> 1:10:56.414
I got... I'm living a nightmare.

1:11:01.053 --> 1:11:03.856
And Cedric, man,
I'm letting Cedric down.

1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:17.703
Oh.

1:11:17.737 --> 1:11:20.206
Oh, this motherfucker.

1:11:20.239 --> 1:11:22.208
Oh, Dave.

1:11:22.241 --> 1:11:24.744
Hey, what the hell do you want?

1:11:24.777 --> 1:11:27.512
Hey, man, actually I heard
that you were doing a movie,

1:11:27.545 --> 1:11:28.981
a sequel to a movie
you did before

1:11:29.015 --> 1:11:30.615
- that was a big hit.
- Oh, you did?

1:11:30.650 --> 1:11:31.984
Like, yeah, it's all over
the Twitter, man.

1:11:32.018 --> 1:11:34.419
Oh, is it, and?

1:11:35.988 --> 1:11:37.555
Been hitting that bottle
kinda hard, haven't you?

1:11:37.589 --> 1:11:40.159
Oh, I've been
hitting the bottle kinda hard,

1:11:40.192 --> 1:11:42.028
and if I have?

1:11:42.061 --> 1:11:44.496
- Hey, man, whatever feels right.
- Right.

1:11:44.529 --> 1:11:46.732
But, look, I was thinking
with you doing this movie,

1:11:46.766 --> 1:11:48.701
you gotta be getting paid,
so you think you'll

1:11:48.734 --> 1:11:50.836
have that rent check
any time soon?

1:11:50.870 --> 1:11:52.939
Mm, mm, mm.

1:11:55.641 --> 1:11:57.076
No.

1:11:57.109 --> 1:11:59.679
No, I don't have it, but,

1:11:59.712 --> 1:12:02.480
when I do,

1:12:02.514 --> 1:12:03.849
- you have it.
- Okay.

1:12:03.883 --> 1:12:05.583
Hey, look, man, that's cool,
'cause look,

1:12:05.617 --> 1:12:07.753
I would hate to have to evict
a big superstar like you.

1:12:07.787 --> 1:12:09.889
- Exactly, you can't.
- But, you know what?

1:12:09.922 --> 1:12:11.958
Speaking of superstars,
in addition to being

1:12:11.991 --> 1:12:13.793
a property manager,
I do a little bit of acting.

1:12:13.826 --> 1:12:15.728
Oh, wow.

1:12:15.761 --> 1:12:17.997
Yo.

1:12:18.030 --> 1:12:19.665
Fuck no.

1:12:19.699 --> 1:12:21.901
- Oh.
- No.

1:12:24.704 --> 1:12:27.106
Hey, but if you change
your mind, man, let me know.

1:12:27.139 --> 1:12:28.741
I got your back, Matt.

1:12:28.774 --> 1:12:30.242
Life's A Beach.

1:12:30.276 --> 1:12:31.877
Motherfucker.

1:12:35.081 --> 1:12:37.249
Go away, Dave!

1:12:37.283 --> 1:12:41.153
Okay, I don't have your money,
and you can't audition!

1:12:41.187 --> 1:12:43.823
And I hate you!

1:12:43.856 --> 1:12:46.993
Hi, baby, it's me, it's Mommy.

1:12:47.026 --> 1:12:49.128
- Mom, is that you?
- Yes.

1:12:49.161 --> 1:12:51.230
Can you please open the door?

1:12:53.933 --> 1:12:56.702
Mom, hey, Mom.

1:12:56.736 --> 1:12:58.804
Oh, wow.

1:12:58.838 --> 1:13:00.906
- You look terrible.
- Well, Mom,

1:13:00.940 --> 1:13:04.710
I finally opened the box,
and look what I found.

1:13:04.744 --> 1:13:06.912
Are you proud of me
that I finally opened it?

1:13:06.946 --> 1:13:08.647
- Yeah.
- I finally did it.

1:13:08.681 --> 1:13:10.282
Give me this.

1:13:10.316 --> 1:13:12.151
You need to sit down.

1:13:13.853 --> 1:13:15.755
Really?

1:13:15.788 --> 1:13:17.189
Babe.

1:13:17.223 --> 1:13:18.924
Oh, God.

1:13:18.958 --> 1:13:21.961
You smell like
a street corner wino.

1:13:21.994 --> 1:13:23.696
You know the last time
we talked, you said

1:13:23.729 --> 1:13:27.199
- you were getting better.
- I was.

1:13:27.233 --> 1:13:31.070
And it just all...
it just all went to hell.

1:13:31.103 --> 1:13:33.639
I can see that.

1:13:33.672 --> 1:13:34.907
Baby, I've been
calling Lisa on her phone

1:13:34.940 --> 1:13:36.642
and she's not answering.

1:13:36.675 --> 1:13:38.811
I'm calling you on your phone,
you're not answering.

1:13:38.844 --> 1:13:41.180
I wanna know what's happening,
I mean, is she helping you,

1:13:41.213 --> 1:13:44.316
- is she getting you better?
- I love her.

1:13:44.350 --> 1:13:45.985
- I love her, Mom.
- Who?

1:13:46.018 --> 1:13:47.619
Lisa.

1:13:47.653 --> 1:13:48.988
Oh, no, baby, no.

1:13:49.021 --> 1:13:51.257
You can't love your therapist.

1:13:51.290 --> 1:13:53.092
That's unethical,
and quite frankly,

1:13:53.125 --> 1:13:54.727
- it's just plain...
- Well, you can't help

1:13:54.760 --> 1:13:57.263
who you love, Mom.

1:13:57.296 --> 1:13:59.065
God.

1:13:59.098 --> 1:14:02.968
Baby, I brought Lisa in
to help you get your life back.

1:14:03.002 --> 1:14:04.970
To get you back to doing
the things that you love,

1:14:05.004 --> 1:14:06.906
and to get you out of this house
to see the world.

1:14:06.939 --> 1:14:10.242
I... I am not going anywhere.

1:14:10.276 --> 1:14:13.312
I'm... I'm staying right here

1:14:13.345 --> 1:14:15.381
till fucking Dave evicts me.

1:14:15.414 --> 1:14:17.950
- Evicts you?
- I gotta get money,

1:14:17.983 --> 1:14:20.352
and I gotta get Lisa back.

1:14:20.386 --> 1:14:22.321
Baby,

1:14:22.354 --> 1:14:24.690
you have a problem.

1:14:24.723 --> 1:14:26.992
You can't do this alone.

1:14:27.026 --> 1:14:29.328
Now, I know
your father isn't here,

1:14:29.361 --> 1:14:32.798
- but if he were here...
- Yeah, but he's not here,

1:14:32.832 --> 1:14:34.166
Mom.

1:14:36.102 --> 1:14:37.837
He's not here.

1:14:39.805 --> 1:14:41.941
Oh.

1:14:41.974 --> 1:14:44.777
He's not here.

1:14:54.019 --> 1:14:56.755
Hey, congratulations, fellas.

1:14:56.789 --> 1:14:58.124
I am so proud of you guys.

1:14:58.157 --> 1:14:59.992
Hey, a little toast
to your success.

1:15:00.025 --> 1:15:02.661
- Yeah.
- Uh, to your future endeavors

1:15:02.695 --> 1:15:05.030
in storytelling
and changing lives.

1:15:05.064 --> 1:15:06.832
- Woo.
- And getting paid.

1:15:06.866 --> 1:15:08.200
- All right, there we go.
- I like that.

1:15:08.234 --> 1:15:09.435
Dennis, what are you
doing here, man?

1:15:09.468 --> 1:15:11.237
Shut up, asshole!

1:15:11.270 --> 1:15:14.340
After 10 years, 10 years,

1:15:14.373 --> 1:15:17.343
- and you fire me?
- Dad, what's going on?

1:15:17.376 --> 1:15:19.311
- You ruined my life.
- Okay, look, look,

1:15:19.345 --> 1:15:21.881
Dennis, let's just
talk about it, huh?

1:15:21.914 --> 1:15:24.183
- Whoa, yo!
- Yo, yo, man, don't...

1:15:24.216 --> 1:15:26.986
- No, no!
- Oh, my God!

1:15:27.019 --> 1:15:29.288
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

1:15:29.321 --> 1:15:31.824
Dad, no!

1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:36.328
Fuck it.

1:15:39.431 --> 1:15:42.701
This lunatic just
came out of nowhere

1:15:42.735 --> 1:15:45.871
on my graduation day
and he took my dad away,

1:15:45.905 --> 1:15:49.341
and I was so angry

1:15:49.375 --> 1:15:51.076
that I couldn't
do anything about it.

1:15:51.110 --> 1:15:53.979
I... I couldn't stop it.

1:15:56.282 --> 1:15:59.318
And slowly but surely,
I just saw the outside world

1:15:59.351 --> 1:16:03.022
and I just...

1:16:03.055 --> 1:16:05.491
I couldn't do it anymore.

1:16:05.524 --> 1:16:07.459
Every time I would go outside,

1:16:07.493 --> 1:16:09.828
I'd just see him there

1:16:09.862 --> 1:16:12.798
and just dead.

1:16:12.831 --> 1:16:14.400
I know, I know, babe.

1:16:14.433 --> 1:16:16.869
I know this has been
hard on you.

1:16:16.902 --> 1:16:18.938
It's been hard on me, too.

1:16:18.971 --> 1:16:21.240
But look at me, look,
this is not what your father

1:16:21.273 --> 1:16:22.841
would've wanted for you.

1:16:24.777 --> 1:16:27.413
But I'm sure he wanted to live,

1:16:27.446 --> 1:16:30.783
and so do I, it's just
this is why I stay inside

1:16:30.816 --> 1:16:32.885
- where it's safe.
- Listen to me, okay?

1:16:36.088 --> 1:16:38.757
When your father died,

1:16:38.791 --> 1:16:42.061
I cried so much and for so long,

1:16:42.094 --> 1:16:44.296
I didn't have any tears
left to cry.

1:16:46.365 --> 1:16:48.234
And then you dealing
with your condition,

1:16:48.267 --> 1:16:50.002
you couldn't come and see me.

1:16:52.338 --> 1:16:55.374
And I was in pain
and I was alone,

1:16:55.407 --> 1:16:58.043
and I knew I needed help.

1:16:58.077 --> 1:17:01.113
So, I found a group therapy,

1:17:01.146 --> 1:17:03.816
and... and also,
it's where I met Roy,

1:17:03.849 --> 1:17:06.285
and Roy has been a blessing.

1:17:06.318 --> 1:17:08.520
He's been taking me places
and making me feel...

1:17:08.554 --> 1:17:11.857
Wait, you're cheating on Dad?

1:17:11.890 --> 1:17:13.392
No.

1:17:13.425 --> 1:17:15.894
Listen, I can't
cheat on your father.

1:17:15.928 --> 1:17:18.063
Your father is gone,

1:17:18.097 --> 1:17:20.899
and the sooner you realize that,

1:17:20.933 --> 1:17:22.801
the sooner you'll be able
to get out there and live again.

1:17:22.835 --> 1:17:25.904
No, no.

1:17:25.938 --> 1:17:29.241
No, this is where I belong,
this is where it's safe.

1:17:29.275 --> 1:17:30.809
No, baby, Matt, Matt.

1:17:30.843 --> 1:17:33.078
No, Mom, please, just...

1:17:33.112 --> 1:17:34.446
just... it's fine.

1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:37.283
Just... just go...
just go be with Ray.

1:17:37.316 --> 1:17:39.084
- Roy.
- I don't care.

1:17:39.118 --> 1:17:41.053
He's not Dad.

1:17:41.086 --> 1:17:43.589
All right, just... just go...

1:17:43.622 --> 1:17:47.159
go on your trips
and just have a good time.

1:17:47.192 --> 1:17:48.894
- Mom, please.
- But listen...

1:17:48.927 --> 1:17:50.929
Mom, no, but nothing.

1:17:50.963 --> 1:17:53.532
Just...

1:17:53.565 --> 1:17:56.035
Just please leave.

1:17:56.068 --> 1:17:57.536
Please.

1:18:00.239 --> 1:18:02.308
I love you,

1:18:02.341 --> 1:18:04.076
and I'm here for you

1:18:04.109 --> 1:18:07.313
no matter what, okay?

1:18:07.346 --> 1:18:09.348
Come here.

1:18:19.458 --> 1:18:21.327
Yo, I'm coming!

1:18:21.360 --> 1:18:23.162
God.

1:18:23.195 --> 1:18:25.331
Just fucking hold your horses.

1:18:29.068 --> 1:18:32.137
Hey, man, what's up?

1:18:32.171 --> 1:18:33.539
What's up is
every time I see you

1:18:33.572 --> 1:18:35.541
you starting to look
more and more fucked up.

1:18:42.281 --> 1:18:45.484
They should make a bottle
of whiskey that refills itself.

1:18:47.286 --> 1:18:50.255
- That would be awesome.
- Yeah.

1:18:50.289 --> 1:18:52.424
Give me that.

1:18:54.126 --> 1:18:57.129
Ugh, my head is killing me.

1:18:57.162 --> 1:19:00.065
I see why you didn't wanna
go to the tittie bar.

1:19:00.099 --> 1:19:03.268
You would've got drunk and tried
to touch all the titties.

1:19:05.104 --> 1:19:07.272
And they got
a real strict policy about that.

1:19:07.306 --> 1:19:10.075
- Yeah, I know about the policy.
- Get your ass rolled out.

1:19:10.109 --> 1:19:12.144
Please, believe you me, I know.

1:19:13.545 --> 1:19:15.514
I did not take you
for an alcoholic.

1:19:15.547 --> 1:19:17.349
I'm not an alcoholic.

1:19:19.318 --> 1:19:20.986
But I'm an agoraphobic.

1:19:22.689 --> 1:19:24.890
One who has sex with frogs?

1:19:26.492 --> 1:19:29.061
No, I think that's an ecosexual.

1:19:29.094 --> 1:19:31.698
Oh, right.

1:19:31.731 --> 1:19:33.700
Well,

1:19:33.733 --> 1:19:35.501
seeing you all drunk,

1:19:35.534 --> 1:19:38.638
and out your mind,
and fucked up,

1:19:38.671 --> 1:19:41.708
started reminding me of myself
and how I used to be.

1:19:41.741 --> 1:19:44.644
Losing my mind,
lost women, lost money,

1:19:44.677 --> 1:19:46.545
lost opportunity.

1:19:46.578 --> 1:19:49.281
Lost all that shit.

1:19:49.314 --> 1:19:52.351
But one good thing
came out of it.

1:19:52.384 --> 1:19:53.619
What's that?

1:19:55.487 --> 1:19:58.123
It's part of me.

1:19:58.157 --> 1:20:00.660
Script about my life.

1:20:00.693 --> 1:20:02.695
About how I used to get
all fucked up and drunk,

1:20:02.729 --> 1:20:05.998
and losing my mind.

1:20:06.031 --> 1:20:08.367
Like, I went to AA, and...

1:20:08.400 --> 1:20:10.703
and I turned it all around
and got it back together.

1:20:14.473 --> 1:20:17.242
Sound like a Disney movie.

1:20:17.276 --> 1:20:20.045
You can call it
whatever you wanna call it.

1:20:20.078 --> 1:20:21.980
I was just hoping that
maybe you could use it

1:20:22.014 --> 1:20:25.350
to get your life back on track.

1:20:29.121 --> 1:20:31.523
You know, that's...

1:20:31.557 --> 1:20:34.092
that's why I did Life's A Beach.

1:20:35.594 --> 1:20:37.496
It just...

1:20:37.529 --> 1:20:40.432
felt so real.

1:20:40.466 --> 1:20:43.101
You know, me and my boys, we...

1:20:43.135 --> 1:20:47.039
we had just finished up
our last year of grad school,

1:20:47.072 --> 1:20:49.608
went on this beach vacation,
just scared.

1:20:49.642 --> 1:20:51.510
We didn't know
what was gonna happen next.

1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:56.181
So, I just wanted to document
the whole thing, you know?

1:20:56.215 --> 1:20:59.585
Just show these four guys

1:20:59.618 --> 1:21:01.353
trying to figure out their life,

1:21:01.386 --> 1:21:03.522
and I don't know,

1:21:03.555 --> 1:21:05.123
maybe somebody in the same boat

1:21:05.157 --> 1:21:08.193
could look at them and say,

1:21:08.227 --> 1:21:09.995
"Hey, I'm not alone."

1:21:12.598 --> 1:21:14.801
Well,

1:21:14.834 --> 1:21:18.303
looks like my work here is done.

1:21:18.337 --> 1:21:21.206
And on that note, I'm out, kid.

1:21:23.676 --> 1:21:25.244
You make it happen, all right?

1:21:25.277 --> 1:21:27.780
Make me proud.

1:21:27.814 --> 1:21:30.082
Um, you wouldn't happen to have

1:21:30.115 --> 1:21:33.285
any quarters,
like a roll of quarters?

1:21:33.318 --> 1:21:35.354
I gotta wash
a couple comforters.

1:21:35.387 --> 1:21:37.256
Nah, no, Norman,

1:21:37.289 --> 1:21:39.091
- I don't have no...
- No quarters?

1:21:39.124 --> 1:21:40.425
I don't have any quarters, man.

1:21:40.459 --> 1:21:43.061
Okay, that's all right.

1:21:43.095 --> 1:21:45.063
Maybe you can do something
with that script

1:21:45.097 --> 1:21:47.499
and get me a washer.

1:22:19.398 --> 1:22:21.734
That was actually really good.

1:22:40.319 --> 1:22:41.854
I can do this.

1:22:43.422 --> 1:22:45.123
You can do this, baby.

1:22:45.157 --> 1:22:47.292
I'm going outside.

1:22:47.326 --> 1:22:48.828
Let's go, man.

1:22:48.861 --> 1:22:51.196
You got this, man, let's go.

1:22:51.229 --> 1:22:53.733
You can do this.

1:22:53.766 --> 1:22:55.702
It's all good.

1:22:55.735 --> 1:22:57.837
All right.

1:23:09.247 --> 1:23:10.515
Do it.

1:23:10.549 --> 1:23:11.684
I can do it.

1:23:11.718 --> 1:23:14.252
I can do this.

1:23:14.286 --> 1:23:15.554
I can do it.

1:23:21.961 --> 1:23:23.528
I can do it.

1:23:25.297 --> 1:23:26.933
I can do it.

1:23:26.966 --> 1:23:28.367
I can do it.

1:23:31.871 --> 1:23:33.338
I can do this.

1:23:34.974 --> 1:23:36.909
I can do it.

1:23:46.953 --> 1:23:50.389
I can't do it, I can't do this,
I'm not doing it.

1:23:50.422 --> 1:23:53.358
Hey, I need you.

1:23:53.392 --> 1:23:54.694
It's an emergency.

1:24:02.267 --> 1:24:04.536
- You came.
- You said it was an emergency.

1:24:04.569 --> 1:24:06.471
So, what's the emergency?

1:24:06.505 --> 1:24:08.240
Please, come in.

1:24:09.842 --> 1:24:12.344
After I read Norman's script,
I was like,

1:24:12.377 --> 1:24:14.379
"I could do this."

1:24:14.413 --> 1:24:16.581
Right, so I...
I made my way to the door,

1:24:16.615 --> 1:24:19.418
and...

1:24:19.451 --> 1:24:21.988
I couldn't do it.

1:24:22.021 --> 1:24:24.556
Sorry to hear that, Matt.

1:24:24.589 --> 1:24:26.625
- That's it?
- Yeah.

1:24:28.293 --> 1:24:29.962
That's all I'm gonna get?

1:24:29.996 --> 1:24:33.265
- It's all I got.
- Yeah, I get it.

1:24:33.298 --> 1:24:35.735
Probably still mad
about the panties thing.

1:24:35.768 --> 1:24:37.436
It's not like we're a thing,

1:24:37.469 --> 1:24:39.471
and we shouldn't be,
you're my patient.

1:24:39.504 --> 1:24:41.874
So, whosever panties those were,

1:24:41.908 --> 1:24:44.509
be it your ex,
or a groupie, or an actress

1:24:44.543 --> 1:24:48.346
- trying to get a part.
- Or in my case, all the above.

1:24:48.380 --> 1:24:49.716
What?

1:24:51.583 --> 1:24:54.854
Samantha did come by
and she tried to seduce me.

1:24:54.887 --> 1:24:58.390
It's probably just
to get a role in my movie.

1:24:58.423 --> 1:25:00.358
Of course.

1:25:00.392 --> 1:25:03.295
Um, I didn't wanna
be away from the world.

1:25:03.328 --> 1:25:05.564
I didn't wanna be all alone.

1:25:05.597 --> 1:25:07.667
But you're not all alone.

1:25:07.700 --> 1:25:10.670
You have your fans,
your friends, your family.

1:25:12.571 --> 1:25:14.239
And you even have me.

1:25:17.877 --> 1:25:20.747
- I do.
- Yeah.

1:25:20.780 --> 1:25:23.281
Thank you.

1:25:23.315 --> 1:25:24.984
Are you ready
to get to this meeting?

1:25:26.719 --> 1:25:28.888
- No.
- What else is there?

1:25:30.690 --> 1:25:34.392
I saw my father...

1:25:34.426 --> 1:25:37.329
saw my father die
right in front of me.

1:25:40.900 --> 1:25:44.904
Just some crazy person, just...

1:25:44.937 --> 1:25:46.739
ended his life.

1:25:49.876 --> 1:25:52.310
I can't get past that.

1:25:52.344 --> 1:25:54.379
I see it over and over
and over again

1:25:54.412 --> 1:25:56.048
every time I try to go outside.

1:25:58.785 --> 1:26:02.054
Admitting that was big.

1:26:02.088 --> 1:26:04.657
But you know what's
more powerful than fear?

1:26:06.859 --> 1:26:07.994
Love.

1:26:10.529 --> 1:26:12.965
So, I want you
to close your eyes,

1:26:12.999 --> 1:26:17.069
and picture all the things
and people you love,

1:26:17.103 --> 1:26:19.872
and let that set you free.

1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:22.607
What do you see?

1:26:22.642 --> 1:26:26.012
I see Cedric and I back on set
making movies again.

1:26:26.045 --> 1:26:27.814
Sounds awesome.

1:26:30.615 --> 1:26:33.418
I see you and me running
hand in hand on the beach.

1:26:35.087 --> 1:26:37.757
I see us at our wedding.

1:26:37.790 --> 1:26:41.459
Big house, bunch of
little rug rats running around.

1:26:41.493 --> 1:26:43.495
- Okay, that's a bit...
- Yeah, you right, I'm sorry,

1:26:43.528 --> 1:26:45.998
that's too soon.

1:26:48.935 --> 1:26:50.837
Thank you.

1:26:53.873 --> 1:26:55.007
I think I'm ready
to get out there

1:26:55.041 --> 1:26:57.009
and make things happen.

1:26:59.045 --> 1:27:01.747
And I'll be right here
by your side.

1:27:12.091 --> 1:27:13.592
Matt, what's going on?

1:27:15.695 --> 1:27:17.997
- I can't do this.
- Are you serious?

1:27:18.030 --> 1:27:19.966
No, no, no, I... I can do this.

1:27:22.500 --> 1:27:24.637
I just gotta do
something else first.

1:27:29.108 --> 1:27:33.012
Today is day 500.

1:27:33.045 --> 1:27:36.849
So, it's 500 days
since I've been outside.

1:27:38.818 --> 1:27:40.987
That's a long-ass time.

1:27:41.020 --> 1:27:43.890
Um.

1:27:43.923 --> 1:27:45.758
I'm surprised
I didn't lose my mind.

1:27:47.660 --> 1:27:50.663
But it was with your support

1:27:50.696 --> 1:27:52.832
and the help of some
really amazing people and...

1:27:55.201 --> 1:27:58.570
...and a very special woman

1:27:58.603 --> 1:28:00.973
that I'm finally ready
to go out there

1:28:01.007 --> 1:28:04.176
and face my fears, and get back
to doing what I love.

1:28:04.210 --> 1:28:06.012
Now, I suffer from agoraphobia.

1:28:08.214 --> 1:28:09.916
And you may be suffering
from something, too,

1:28:09.949 --> 1:28:11.918
but just... just know that
whatever that something is,

1:28:11.951 --> 1:28:13.618
you can overcome it.

1:28:13.653 --> 1:28:17.056
You know, it took me some...
some much needed time,

1:28:17.089 --> 1:28:19.992
a lot of therapy, and just
me getting my shit right,

1:28:20.026 --> 1:28:21.994
but...

1:28:22.028 --> 1:28:23.763
but I'm better now.

1:28:25.932 --> 1:28:27.599
I'm ready to go out there
and just live

1:28:27.633 --> 1:28:30.535
a happy, fulfilling life.

1:28:30.568 --> 1:28:33.773
And with that said,
hello, world.

1:28:33.806 --> 1:28:35.473
I'm back,

1:28:35.507 --> 1:28:37.609
and I love you guys, too.

1:28:37.643 --> 1:28:40.079
I am so proud of you.

1:28:40.112 --> 1:28:41.914
I couldn't have done this
without you.

1:28:54.060 --> 1:28:57.196
- Think I'm ready now.
- Let's do it.

1:28:57.229 --> 1:28:58.898
Let's go.

1:29:26.726 --> 1:29:28.626
Okay.

1:29:31.163 --> 1:29:33.132
So, Matt, Dining Indoors
is based on

1:29:33.165 --> 1:29:35.234
your real-life experience
of suffering

1:29:35.267 --> 1:29:38.137
- and overcoming agoraphobia?
- Yeah, that's correct.

1:29:38.170 --> 1:29:39.839
And you know what, I went to
the studio about this idea.

1:29:39.872 --> 1:29:41.974
I just... I'd let 'em know
how much I wanted

1:29:42.008 --> 1:29:45.111
to really help people
overcome their traumas.

1:29:45.144 --> 1:29:48.981
So, uh, thankfully
they believed in my visions.

1:29:49.015 --> 1:29:50.850
Yeah.

1:29:50.883 --> 1:29:53.085
And cut us a big-ass check.

1:29:53.119 --> 1:29:54.787
I just got a Gucci belt.

1:30:11.270 --> 1:30:13.239
Baby, hey.

1:30:13.272 --> 1:30:14.840
Look at you,
I'm so proud of you.

1:30:14.874 --> 1:30:17.176
- Thank you, Ma.
- And I want you to meet Roy.

1:30:17.209 --> 1:30:18.878
Hey, man, what's good, man?

1:30:18.911 --> 1:30:19.945
We're not there...
we're not there yet?

1:30:19.979 --> 1:30:22.748
- Nah, man, no.
- Okay.

1:30:30.823 --> 1:30:32.658
- You did your thing, brother.
- You got next, bro.

1:30:32.691 --> 1:30:35.027
Oh, oh, I got next now,
I'm on tour right now.

1:30:35.061 --> 1:30:36.762
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, getting my life...

1:30:36.796 --> 1:30:38.931
After you got your life
together, why not get mine?

1:30:38.964 --> 1:30:40.132
- Hey, there you...
- You know, so I'm on tour.

1:30:40.166 --> 1:30:41.700
- Right.
- Got my lady back.

1:30:41.734 --> 1:30:43.269
- I gotta go.
- Her son moved out.

1:30:43.302 --> 1:30:45.004
- That's good, I'm gonna...
- So, I gotta deal with him.

1:30:45.037 --> 1:30:46.972
- No, I gotta go and, uh...
- Oh, okay, okay, well,

1:30:47.006 --> 1:30:48.606
- I'll call you...
- Hey.

1:31:37.990 --> 1:31:39.692
Hey, good job today.

1:31:39.725 --> 1:31:41.193
Cool, awesome, thank you.

1:31:41.227 --> 1:31:43.896
I think I smell a hit, man.

1:31:43.929 --> 1:31:46.732
- Great job, you made it happen.
- Thank you, thank you.
