00:00.609 --> 00:03.495
That bit. That's better.

00:03.562 --> 00:07.198
Nasty bit. I don't like that bit, either.

00:07.267 --> 00:08.166
There we are.

00:09.937 --> 00:11.670
Yes.

00:44.638 --> 00:46.204
Hi!

00:46.273 --> 00:48.273
Hi. Oh, you're chipper.

00:49.476 --> 00:50.742
Oh, ew, Mom.

00:50.811 --> 00:52.544
Don't smell me. You're so creepy.

00:52.612 --> 00:53.578
Sorry.

00:54.948 --> 00:56.247
Uh, Harvey's over.

00:56.316 --> 00:57.983
Oh. He is?

00:58.051 --> 01:00.385
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

01:00.454 --> 01:02.087
Does he want to stay for dinner?

01:02.155 --> 01:03.388
I'm making.

01:03.457 --> 01:05.657
Um, I don't know.

01:05.726 --> 01:06.992
Well,

01:07.060 --> 01:08.360
he could be out here

01:08.428 --> 01:10.028
helping us with the groceries, maybe.

01:10.097 --> 01:11.262
- Oh, no, Mom. It's fine.
- Don't you think?

01:11.331 --> 01:13.999
No, we got it. We're strong,

01:14.067 --> 01:16.001
independent women.

01:20.140 --> 01:22.607
Hey, Harvey. Hi.

01:22.676 --> 01:24.843
Something wrong with your bones?

01:24.911 --> 01:26.044
The way you're laying there,

01:26.113 --> 01:27.178
I should call someone, right?

01:27.247 --> 01:30.115
Ha ha! I'm just kidding.

01:30.183 --> 01:32.117
Anyway, you must be exhausted.

01:32.185 --> 01:33.952
You look completely exhausted.

01:34.021 --> 01:35.787
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah.

01:35.856 --> 01:38.757
Oh, no. We got these. That's fine.

01:38.825 --> 01:42.427
Uh, so, Harvey, would you
like to stay for dinner?

01:42.496 --> 01:44.863
Uh, yeah, sure. That would be sweet.

01:44.931 --> 01:46.464
All right. Cool.

01:46.533 --> 01:48.533
Okay, Mom, we're going to go upstairs now.

01:48.602 --> 01:51.102
No, no, no, no, no, baby. Stay down here.

01:51.171 --> 01:52.971
Oh, no, Mom, seriously. We're
just going to do homework.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.573
No, no, no, no, no. Come
help me with the groceries.

01:55.642 --> 01:57.108
No. It's cool. I'll wait.

01:57.177 --> 01:59.077
You want to help me cook?

01:59.146 --> 02:00.712
Oh, no, Mom. We have a lot of homework.

02:18.331 --> 02:19.564
That's great.

02:19.633 --> 02:20.965
What is that?

02:21.034 --> 02:23.868
Just messing around, something.

02:25.505 --> 02:27.806
Hey, can I borrow you for a minute?

02:27.874 --> 02:29.307
Yeah. Sure.

02:29.376 --> 02:31.242
Cool. Step into my office.

02:31.311 --> 02:34.079
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Come on down.

02:34.147 --> 02:36.247
Don't worry about it. I'm
just going to talk to him.

02:36.316 --> 02:38.283
No, Mom, this is... No,
that's kind of weird.

02:38.351 --> 02:39.951
- It's cool.
- No, no, no, Mom.

02:40.020 --> 02:41.352
- It's all right, baby.
- Mom, this is really...

02:43.190 --> 02:44.322
Mom?

02:44.391 --> 02:45.790
Whew.

02:45.859 --> 02:47.158
- Mom!
- Have a seat.

02:47.227 --> 02:48.660
- Mom!
- Okay.

02:48.728 --> 02:51.096
Mom! Um, no, no no! This is so weird!

02:51.164 --> 02:53.098
- Mom, please!
- I don't mean to scare you.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.966
- Mom!
- I'm not scared.

02:55.035 --> 02:56.768
Mom! Mom!

02:56.837 --> 02:58.002
- You know what?
- Mom!

02:58.071 --> 02:59.471
Come down here. It's quieter.

02:59.539 --> 03:01.139
- Mom! Mom, no!
- It's all right.

03:01.208 --> 03:02.607
I'm not going to murder you.

03:02.676 --> 03:04.042
Mom!

03:04.111 --> 03:05.443
- Uh...
- Yeah. Go on in there.

03:05.512 --> 03:06.878
It's just the laundry room. Yeah.

03:06.947 --> 03:07.946
Mom!

03:08.014 --> 03:09.981
Oh. Great.

03:10.050 --> 03:13.017
There you go. You sit.

03:13.086 --> 03:15.720
Okay, Harvey,

03:15.789 --> 03:17.522
you have to understand

03:17.591 --> 03:20.158
that I'm Mom, Dad, and
the cops around here,

03:20.227 --> 03:22.127
and you seem like a nice kid,

03:22.195 --> 03:23.795
but the first time I ever met you,

03:23.864 --> 03:25.697
you lied right to my face.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.399
Wait. What?

03:28.468 --> 03:31.569
Yeah. It was when Max and Tyler were here

03:31.638 --> 03:33.872
and they asked me if you could sleep over,

03:33.940 --> 03:37.075
and they said, "It's okay.
Harvey is gay. Ask him."

03:37.144 --> 03:38.409
And I asked you,

03:38.478 --> 03:40.411
and you turned to me
with your adorable face,

03:40.480 --> 03:42.480
and you said, "Yeah, I'm totally gay."

03:44.151 --> 03:47.018
Yeah, they told me to
say those things, so...

03:47.087 --> 03:48.419
Okay. That's even worse.

03:48.488 --> 03:50.321
So be that as it may,

03:50.390 --> 03:53.158
you lied right to my face
straight out of the gate.

03:53.226 --> 03:55.827
Wait. Do you want me to be gay?

03:55.896 --> 03:57.028
I... I don't... I don't get it.

03:57.097 --> 03:58.530
I don't care what you are.

03:58.598 --> 04:00.698
Gay guys can sleep in
my daughter's room naked,

04:00.767 --> 04:02.834
but straight guys and liars don't get to.

04:02.903 --> 04:05.937
My daughter has never had, like,

04:06.006 --> 04:08.773
a kind of relationship
with a guy before thing,

04:08.842 --> 04:11.242
so I would suggest

04:11.311 --> 04:15.747
that you guys just work
on the friendship, okay?

04:15.815 --> 04:18.048
You can come over. I'll cook for you.

04:18.118 --> 04:19.684
You guys could do homework.

04:19.753 --> 04:22.387
It may help her focus. It may help you.

04:22.455 --> 04:23.955
Another little thing.

04:24.024 --> 04:26.057
I don't want you to smoke
or drink around my daughter.

04:26.126 --> 04:27.959
I don't want you to smoke or drink period,

04:28.028 --> 04:31.596
but if you do, I want you to lie
to my daughter that you don't.

04:31.665 --> 04:33.431
And one last thing.

04:33.500 --> 04:39.204
That should go nowhere
near my daughter. Okay?

04:39.272 --> 04:41.206
Do we understand each other?

04:41.274 --> 04:43.942
Let's hug it out. Okay?

04:44.010 --> 04:45.410
Come here.

04:45.478 --> 04:47.412
Good job. You did good.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.714
That wasn't so scary. Okay!

04:49.783 --> 04:51.649
Honey, you can't.

04:51.718 --> 04:53.084
What? What can't?

04:53.153 --> 04:54.319
You can't point

04:54.387 --> 04:56.287
at a 15-year-old
boy's dick.

04:56.356 --> 04:58.122
I just pointed.

04:58.191 --> 04:59.824
I don't want his
15-year-old dick

04:59.893 --> 05:01.793
pointing at my
15-year-old daughter.

05:01.861 --> 05:03.494
That was the point of that point.

05:03.563 --> 05:05.396
Oh, my God.

05:05.465 --> 05:08.800
You sequestered a minor in a room forcibly

05:08.868 --> 05:11.135
and pointed at his penis.

05:11.204 --> 05:13.671
Do you know how close to jail you are?

05:13.740 --> 05:17.642
Oh. Well, sorry.

05:17.711 --> 05:19.177
Not really sorry.

05:19.246 --> 05:23.014
Three people told me
that loved my skirt today,

05:23.083 --> 05:26.618
and I told them I'm a thrift shop addict.

05:27.821 --> 05:30.588
Anyway, just so you know,

05:30.657 --> 05:33.157
I went to see my hand doctor today...

05:33.226 --> 05:35.293
or actually, was it yesterday?

05:35.362 --> 05:37.495
and he gave me a shot,

05:37.564 --> 05:38.863
and it helped a lot.

05:38.932 --> 05:41.633
So obviously I'm not allergic to it.

05:41.701 --> 05:43.468
Did I tell you this already?

05:43.536 --> 05:45.536
Phyl, you should go home now.

05:45.605 --> 05:48.873
I know. I eat so slowly,
it drives her crazy.

05:48.942 --> 05:51.175
- This is delicious.
- It sure was.

05:51.244 --> 05:54.012
And you know what, dear? I
will come and sit with you.

05:54.080 --> 05:59.217
Ah. So are you getting
Sam some more work lately?

05:59.286 --> 06:01.286
Because I read this book...

06:01.354 --> 06:04.155
...and there was a project... Oh. Sorry.

06:04.224 --> 06:05.657
- Time for me to go.
- Hmm.

06:05.725 --> 06:06.958
This was delicious.

06:07.027 --> 06:08.626
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

06:08.695 --> 06:10.261
I'm so lucky.

06:11.431 --> 06:13.364
Okay. I'll clean.

06:13.433 --> 06:15.533
Thank you very much. Glad you liked it.

06:15.602 --> 06:16.634
I did like it.

06:16.703 --> 06:17.802
Can I have some candy now?

06:17.871 --> 06:18.803
I think you can.

06:18.872 --> 06:20.204
Darling,

06:20.273 --> 06:23.041
oh, you've got such beautiful skin.

06:23.109 --> 06:24.742
Let me see your teeth.

06:24.811 --> 06:27.178
Did your mommy make
your dentist appointment?

06:27.247 --> 06:28.379
- Did you?
- Phyl.

06:28.448 --> 06:29.714
- I know.
- Night-night.

06:29.783 --> 06:30.915
- Night-night.
- Ta-ra.

06:30.984 --> 06:33.051
- Ta-ra-ra-boom-dee-ay.
- Bye.

06:33.119 --> 06:34.385
Can I have some?

06:34.454 --> 06:35.987
Yeah.

06:36.056 --> 06:38.189
You guys can have, like, one more piece.

06:38.258 --> 06:39.324
Ohh.

06:39.392 --> 06:40.358
Can Rory have...

06:40.427 --> 06:41.392
- Mm-hmm.
- Kit-Kat?

06:41.461 --> 06:42.527
Yeah, there's no nuts.

06:42.595 --> 06:45.063
"Two is the beginning of the end."

06:45.131 --> 06:47.332
Mama, no offense,

06:47.400 --> 06:49.667
but you're kind of mean to Gran.

06:49.736 --> 06:53.705
Oh. Honey, you're going
to be mean to me, too.

06:53.773 --> 06:56.240
Your sisters already are.

06:56.309 --> 06:59.077
In fact, I need you to
be mean to me when I'm old

06:59.145 --> 07:00.411
so I don't feel so bad

07:00.480 --> 07:03.681
about how mean I am to
your grandmother now.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.217
Was Gran mean to her mom?

07:06.286 --> 07:07.618
I don't think so.

07:07.687 --> 07:09.687
I think I started it.

07:18.031 --> 07:20.198
"Of course they lived at 14.

07:20.266 --> 07:23.041
Until Wendy came, her
mother was the chief one."

07:26.136 --> 07:27.709
Don't you think? It might be...

07:27.764 --> 07:29.796
Oh! What the hell!

07:29.865 --> 07:32.733
Oh, my God, Mom.

07:32.801 --> 07:34.535
You freaked.

07:34.603 --> 07:36.603
That's not funny.

07:36.672 --> 07:39.439
A person could get injured,
and they could sue you.

07:39.508 --> 07:41.708
Nan, Mom's not going to
sue me. It's just a coat.

07:41.777 --> 07:43.043
I sued my mother.

07:43.112 --> 07:44.144
Mom.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.345
Goodbye.

07:47.116 --> 07:49.449
- Ooh.
- Are you okay?

07:49.518 --> 07:52.386
You know, she keeps doing
that to me on purpose.

07:52.454 --> 07:54.988
Okay, this shit is on now!

07:55.057 --> 07:58.992
I'm going to get her back. Ho-ho! Yes.

07:59.061 --> 08:00.761
Mama, what are you going to do?

08:00.829 --> 08:01.828
Mom, I'm scared.

08:01.897 --> 08:03.664
No, baby. Don't you be scared.

08:03.732 --> 08:05.933
I'm only playing. Mom
and Frankie are in a game.

08:06.001 --> 08:06.833
We're going to scare each other.

08:06.902 --> 08:07.935
Oh, can I be in it?

08:08.003 --> 08:08.969
Can I help scare her?

08:09.038 --> 08:10.504
Sure.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.272
But not too scary, though, right?

08:12.341 --> 08:14.174
Well, I really want to scare her, though.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.343
But I don't want it to be too scary.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.012
Well, then maybe you
could just let Mama do it.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.414
But I want to be in it.

08:20.482 --> 08:22.349
Okay, let's not worry about it right now.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.084
Just go get your stuff together.

08:24.153 --> 08:25.452
Wait. Why?

08:25.521 --> 08:26.587
Because you're going to Pepper's house.

08:26.655 --> 08:27.487
Remember?

08:27.556 --> 08:28.622
What?

08:28.691 --> 08:29.856
You're sleeping over.

08:29.925 --> 08:30.857
You're going to paint her room.

08:30.926 --> 08:33.025
Oh, shit, I forgot.

08:35.397 --> 08:36.363
Duke.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.597
I'm sorry, Mama.

08:37.666 --> 08:39.265
I didn't mean to say that.

08:39.335 --> 08:41.434
- I don't know...
- My baby.

08:41.503 --> 08:43.470
Your first swear.

08:43.539 --> 08:46.440
I wish Uncle Modie was here

08:46.508 --> 08:48.709
- because he would tickle you!
- Oh, no!

08:48.777 --> 08:50.344
- He would tickle you!
- Oh, no!

08:50.412 --> 08:53.814
And he would wash your mouth out with soap!

08:53.882 --> 08:58.385
Okay. I am about to scare
the shit out of you, Frankie.

08:59.688 --> 09:01.555
Frankie, baby,

09:01.624 --> 09:03.490
remember you told me to tell you

09:03.559 --> 09:05.692
if I ever saw a big coyote?

09:05.761 --> 09:08.729
There's a huge one outside. Get your phone.

09:08.797 --> 09:10.130
Frankie.

09:11.867 --> 09:13.433
Whoo. Boo!

09:14.770 --> 09:15.869
Oh, my God, Mom.

09:15.938 --> 09:17.704
That so didn't scare me at all.

09:17.773 --> 09:19.873
Was there even really a coyote out there?

09:19.942 --> 09:20.907
No.

09:20.976 --> 09:23.076
Mom, you're so lame.

09:24.246 --> 09:25.812
Turn the lights on.

09:25.881 --> 09:28.615
Okay, fine. I'll turn the lights on.

09:31.754 --> 09:34.388
Look. The power's out.

09:34.456 --> 09:37.224
Okay, Mom? Don't.

09:37.292 --> 09:38.659
I know what you're doing.

09:38.727 --> 09:40.260
What?

09:40.329 --> 09:42.696
Try the switch yourself.

09:42.765 --> 09:43.797
Here.

09:45.134 --> 09:46.366
You're doing this

09:46.435 --> 09:48.368
because I said you're not fun anymore.

09:48.437 --> 09:50.037
Really?

09:50.105 --> 09:52.439
- I don't even remember that!
- Oh!

09:52.508 --> 09:54.341
Aah! Aah!

09:54.410 --> 09:55.942
- You...
- Yeah!

09:56.011 --> 09:58.578
No! No! No!

09:58.647 --> 10:00.914
I can scare you!

10:00.983 --> 10:02.349
- Yeah!
- You didn't.

10:02.418 --> 10:04.017
You're gonna pay!

10:04.086 --> 10:05.052
You're gonna pay!

10:05.120 --> 10:06.753
- Oh!
- Oof!

10:09.358 --> 10:10.691
- No!
- Yes!

10:10.759 --> 10:13.193
And she's down!

10:13.262 --> 10:14.594
No!

10:14.663 --> 10:17.898
Yes! Yes! Ha!

10:17.966 --> 10:18.832
Ow!

10:20.102 --> 10:22.035
Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow ow!

10:22.104 --> 10:23.870
T.O. T.O., T.O., T.O.

10:23.939 --> 10:26.640
T.O. Frankie, T.O. Ow, ow, ow!

10:26.709 --> 10:29.242
T.O. T.O. I hurt my foot.

10:29.311 --> 10:32.045
I hurt my foot, seriously. Get off.

10:32.114 --> 10:33.980
Frankie, get off!

10:35.317 --> 10:36.983
You're so dramatic.

10:38.454 --> 10:39.853
I'm not dramatic.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.892
Oh. That was fun. It was really fun.

10:45.961 --> 10:48.462
I'm sorry. I need ice.

10:48.530 --> 10:49.563
- I need ice.
- Whatever, Mom.

10:49.631 --> 10:51.131
We can't ever have any fun.

10:52.367 --> 10:53.633
That was fun.

10:53.702 --> 10:55.602
I said it. We were having fun.

10:55.671 --> 10:56.470
Uhh!

10:56.538 --> 10:58.972
Yeah. Hey, if it was Duke,

10:59.041 --> 11:01.641
you wouldn't even bat an eyelash.

11:01.710 --> 11:03.643
That's disgusting.

11:03.712 --> 11:05.846
And Max gets away with everything.

11:05.914 --> 11:07.114
That's not true.

11:07.182 --> 11:09.149
Today sucked.

11:09.218 --> 11:11.518
I fu..in' hate Jordan and Missy.

11:11.587 --> 11:14.588
I'm so over it. And I don't
even want to be saying this,

11:14.656 --> 11:17.758
but Miss Giovanetti threw me
out of the classroom today.

11:17.826 --> 11:19.159
I was one minute late,

11:19.228 --> 11:21.361
and she made me leave
and stand in the hallway.

11:21.430 --> 11:24.631
Baby, that sounds really hard,
and I'll write to your teacher,

11:24.700 --> 11:26.933
but I need ice.

11:27.002 --> 11:28.769
Whatever, Mom.

11:28.837 --> 11:30.670
Thanks for caring.

11:30.739 --> 11:32.439
Nobody ever gives a shit about me

11:32.508 --> 11:33.607
and what happens to me.

11:39.832 --> 11:42.645
How many feet are there in a fathom?

11:45.099 --> 11:48.634
What type of animal was
inside <i>Sputnik 2</i>

11:48.703 --> 11:52.338
when launched into orbit in 1957?

11:52.407 --> 11:54.907
- Hi, Jackie.
- Come on, Jackie.

11:54.976 --> 11:57.310
Just to warn you, it's Trivia Night.

11:57.378 --> 11:59.645
I know. Frankie's teacher
told me to meet her here.

11:59.714 --> 12:00.880
I'm excited.

12:00.949 --> 12:02.548
So you're going to team up with him?

12:02.617 --> 12:05.718
Um, I didn't know it was a team thing,

12:05.787 --> 12:08.154
but, uh, I guess.

12:09.657 --> 12:12.058
This is just like a vodka pineapple...

12:12.126 --> 12:13.893
Try some. It'll put hair on your chest.

12:13.962 --> 12:16.062
See, I don't need any more of those.

12:16.130 --> 12:18.731
Hi. Are we interrupting something?

12:18.800 --> 12:20.867
We won't wait up.

12:20.935 --> 12:22.034
- I know.
- It's insane.

12:22.103 --> 12:23.269
All I'm saying

12:23.338 --> 12:25.438
is that Mr. Fields is an adorable,

12:25.506 --> 12:28.341
very married "I wouldn't
want to do anything with him,

12:28.409 --> 12:30.376
but I want to all the time" kind of way.

12:30.445 --> 12:33.246
I just love him, and I'm
always looking for an excuse

12:33.314 --> 12:34.881
to, like, have a meeting with him.

12:34.949 --> 12:37.917
Yeah. Those "Paper
Chase" jackets he wears...

12:37.986 --> 12:40.286
elbow patches, corduroy... I swoon.

12:40.355 --> 12:42.121
I know. I knew I loved you.

12:42.190 --> 12:44.457
I love you. Oh, my God.

12:44.525 --> 12:47.026
I can't believe it. I
wasn't going to come here.

12:47.095 --> 12:49.795
I'm so glad. I mean, this is really fun.

12:49.864 --> 12:52.265
Sam, I have to tell you

12:52.333 --> 12:56.302
that Frankie is incredible.

12:56.371 --> 12:58.204
- Really?
- Oh, my God, Sam.

12:58.273 --> 12:59.939
I've been teaching for years,

13:00.008 --> 13:01.974
and you just go from year to year,

13:02.043 --> 13:04.210
and the kids kind of blend together.

13:04.279 --> 13:06.612
But your Frankie... Sam...

13:06.681 --> 13:09.282
- Tell me.
- I feel so connected to her.

13:09.350 --> 13:11.284
She amazes me every day...

13:11.352 --> 13:14.120
the way she writes, the way she thinks.

13:14.188 --> 13:17.056
She's seriously gifted, very, very gifted.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.225
I know. I know it.

13:19.294 --> 13:20.960
But to hear you say it?

13:21.029 --> 13:23.663
And you know I have three,
and she just gets buried...

13:23.731 --> 13:25.064
Absolutely, absolutely.

13:25.133 --> 13:27.433
Sam, I know that you know me

13:27.502 --> 13:28.901
as just an art teacher at...

13:28.970 --> 13:31.938
No, no, no, no, no. We sistas now.

13:32.006 --> 13:33.739
Oh, my God. Really?

13:33.808 --> 13:36.175
Yeah. You're Frankie's school mom.

13:36.244 --> 13:38.511
Ah, Sam! You're making me so effing happy.

13:38.579 --> 13:40.179
But seriously, though, Trieste,

13:40.248 --> 13:42.148
this is making me so happy

13:42.216 --> 13:44.984
because Frankie really needs...

13:46.187 --> 13:47.520
It's true.

13:47.588 --> 13:50.456
She's amazing, and I just wish

13:50.525 --> 13:54.126
that I had all day to guide her.

13:54.195 --> 13:57.964
Yeah, Frankie does need
specific and special attention,

13:58.032 --> 13:59.265
and I want to give that to her.

14:00.868 --> 14:03.302
Jesus. What a relief.

14:03.371 --> 14:06.439
You know, public school
was just not good for her,

14:06.507 --> 14:07.940
not good.

14:08.009 --> 14:10.543
She just... She got left high and dry,

14:10.611 --> 14:12.178
and I'm a piece of shit.

14:12.246 --> 14:14.513
You know, my contract is
up at the end of the year.

14:14.582 --> 14:16.782
Oh. What?

14:16.851 --> 14:17.850
Yeah.

14:17.919 --> 14:19.852
You mean the school year?

14:19.921 --> 14:22.488
No, this calendar year after Xmas.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.490
What? Why?

14:24.559 --> 14:26.559
You know, I was just thinking

14:26.627 --> 14:28.394
I can really be there for Frankie

14:28.463 --> 14:29.795
after I leave school.

14:29.864 --> 14:31.731
I could be her private tutor,

14:31.799 --> 14:33.466
really shape her education,

14:33.534 --> 14:35.201
because I think she needs that.

14:35.269 --> 14:38.404
Oh. Yeah. Would that be part of...

14:38.473 --> 14:41.707
I just feel so close to you and to Frankie,

14:41.776 --> 14:43.542
and I just want to help.

14:43.611 --> 14:46.078
I want to help you, Sam.

14:46.147 --> 14:48.681
I also have always wanted

14:48.750 --> 14:50.816
to do something in the
entertainment industry,

14:50.885 --> 14:53.352
and I could maybe be, like,

14:53.421 --> 14:56.055
be your assistant. Something.

14:56.124 --> 14:58.858
And Frankie told me you have an extra room.

14:58.926 --> 15:02.061
This could be such a
win-win for all of us.

15:02.130 --> 15:04.230
Also, I love to cook,

15:04.298 --> 15:05.898
and I know you love to cook.

15:05.967 --> 15:08.000
I love to eat, too, so...

15:08.069 --> 15:10.369
Homework before anything else.

15:10.438 --> 15:11.771
I know.

15:11.839 --> 15:13.439
What are those?

15:13.508 --> 15:14.440
Ooh.

15:14.509 --> 15:17.510
They're all for Nan.

15:17.578 --> 15:18.878
What?

15:18.946 --> 15:20.413
That's what they say.

15:20.481 --> 15:21.514
Hang on. Hang on.

15:21.582 --> 15:22.882
I want to ask you something

15:22.950 --> 15:24.083
before you go inside.

15:24.152 --> 15:26.352
It's about your teacher Trieste.

15:28.823 --> 15:30.256
What? What?

15:31.626 --> 15:33.626
Trieste is kind of a psycho.

15:34.929 --> 15:37.930
Uh, stalkery, I mean.

15:37.999 --> 15:40.933
No offense, just she's a freakhole.

15:41.002 --> 15:42.301
Huh.

15:42.370 --> 15:43.569
What about her?

15:43.638 --> 15:45.304
- Nothing.
- Okay.

15:45.373 --> 15:47.373
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

15:47.442 --> 15:48.474
What?

15:48.543 --> 15:50.543
Can you take these to Nan's?

15:50.611 --> 15:52.578
Why can't you?

15:52.647 --> 15:54.113
Come on, man.

15:57.018 --> 15:58.584
Mom.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.486
Did you have packages

16:00.555 --> 16:03.456
delivered to my house on purpose?

16:03.524 --> 16:04.757
Because that's not cool.

16:04.826 --> 16:06.158
Nan?

16:06.227 --> 16:08.894
I mean, there's, like,
a shit-ton of boxes...

16:08.963 --> 16:10.296
Oh, my God. Mom!

16:11.833 --> 16:13.466
Mom? Mom.

16:13.534 --> 16:15.634
Mo... N... Mom.

16:15.703 --> 16:16.836
Phyl?

16:16.904 --> 16:18.237
Phyl!

16:18.306 --> 16:21.340
I got you!

16:26.214 --> 16:28.280
Look at her face.

16:28.349 --> 16:30.249
She's so mad.

16:32.186 --> 16:34.286
She's so mad because I got her

16:34.355 --> 16:36.889
and she can't scare me.
Never has been able to.

16:40.261 --> 16:42.161
Nan, you're crazy.

16:42.230 --> 16:44.130
I'm not, dear one.

16:44.198 --> 16:45.764
I'm staying sharp, that's all,

16:45.833 --> 16:48.767
just staying sharp. Now come with me

16:48.836 --> 16:52.037
because I want you to choose a watch

16:52.106 --> 16:53.772
and I've got so many,

16:53.841 --> 16:55.374
and I want you to have one.

16:55.443 --> 16:57.309
Thank you, Nan.

16:57.378 --> 16:59.178
That's very nice.

16:59.247 --> 17:01.147
Oh, I know exactly which one I want.

17:01.215 --> 17:02.481
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

17:02.550 --> 17:04.450
Well, because I like
the one with the velvet.

17:04.519 --> 17:06.785
- Do you?
- Mm, sort of, but I...

17:06.854 --> 17:08.186
The velvet strap.

17:10.023 --> 17:11.457
This looks really good.

17:11.502 --> 17:13.665
You should wear this every day, I think.

17:13.752 --> 17:15.652
Mom, I need a broom.

17:15.721 --> 17:17.387
What for? You're being Elvis.

17:17.455 --> 17:19.156
No, I'm changing it, so I need a broom.

17:19.223 --> 17:20.723
You're changing your costume again?

17:20.791 --> 17:22.291
Mama, I want to change mine.

17:22.361 --> 17:24.461
No way. You're my Cher.

17:24.530 --> 17:25.795
Mom, where's a broom?

17:25.864 --> 17:27.564
What are you being, a witch?

17:27.633 --> 17:30.233
No, I'm going to be a useless
housewife from the '50s.

17:30.302 --> 17:32.035
Ha! I love that!

17:32.104 --> 17:34.704
Mama, do we need to go to
the guy next door again?

17:34.773 --> 17:36.806
Last year he gave us
the dental kind of candy.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.308
Oh, he's an asshole.

17:38.377 --> 17:39.576
He's a shit.

17:39.645 --> 17:41.211
My baby,

17:41.280 --> 17:43.547
all grown-up potty mouth.

17:43.615 --> 17:45.315
Mom, what are you talking about?

17:45.384 --> 17:47.717
Well, can you believe she says "shit" now?

17:47.786 --> 17:49.419
Mom, she's been saying that for years,

17:49.488 --> 17:51.521
just not around you.

17:51.590 --> 17:53.924
- Serious?
- Yeah, she says everything.

17:53.992 --> 17:54.991
No.

17:55.060 --> 17:56.726
Hey, Max, hurry up!

17:56.795 --> 17:58.228
We're leaving soon!

17:58.297 --> 17:59.429
I'll go get her.

17:59.498 --> 18:00.564
You guys finish getting ready.

18:00.632 --> 18:01.765
I'm going to get you a broom.

18:05.771 --> 18:07.604
You're a shit.

18:10.609 --> 18:11.575
Honey...

18:11.643 --> 18:13.343
What?

18:14.613 --> 18:16.112
Uhh, is it Harvey?

18:17.749 --> 18:18.748
What?

18:22.187 --> 18:25.088
Oh, God, what a dick.

18:25.157 --> 18:26.356
Baby.

18:27.626 --> 18:29.759
I'm such a loser!

18:29.828 --> 18:32.462
No. Harvey is a loser.

18:32.531 --> 18:34.431
I'm telling you, I know losers,

18:34.499 --> 18:38.034
and I could smell the loser
on him from a mile away, honey.

18:39.438 --> 18:41.438
No, it hurts, Mom!

18:42.641 --> 18:44.274
And I really like him.

18:45.944 --> 18:48.645
And... And everybody knows.

18:50.349 --> 18:53.383
And he's making fun of me with everybody!

18:53.452 --> 18:57.821
Oh, shit. Honey, I'm really sorry.

18:59.191 --> 19:00.557
Do you want to go trick or treating

19:00.626 --> 19:02.158
with me and your sisters?

19:06.298 --> 19:08.898
No. That's stupid.

19:08.967 --> 19:12.802
Baby, I get it. I get it.

19:12.871 --> 19:14.671
That would have picked
you up a few years ago,

19:14.740 --> 19:17.307
but I just... I don't know
what to say. I'm sorry.

19:17.376 --> 19:20.677
I used to have really
good Mommy toolbox for you,

19:20.746 --> 19:25.081
and now you're a real person,
and your heart is broken,

19:25.150 --> 19:27.984
and I wish I had an easy thing for that,

19:28.053 --> 19:30.186
but nobody does, baby.

19:32.224 --> 19:35.392
I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm really sorry.

19:38.030 --> 19:40.130
I've been a total bitch lately.

19:40.198 --> 19:43.633
That's okay. I can take it.

19:43.702 --> 19:45.101
That I can do for you.

19:48.507 --> 19:49.773
What's going on?

19:49.841 --> 19:51.141
Get out!

19:51.209 --> 19:52.642
What happened?

19:52.711 --> 19:57.013
Frankie, can you please
take Duke trick or treating?

19:57.082 --> 19:58.481
You're not coming?

19:58.550 --> 20:01.851
No. I'm going to stay home with Max.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.553
You guys go.

20:03.622 --> 20:05.255
I'm staying home, too.

20:06.458 --> 20:08.024
Honey, we both can't stay.

20:08.093 --> 20:09.392
Somebody has to take Duke.

20:09.461 --> 20:11.328
I don't care about candy.

20:11.396 --> 20:14.197
Can we stay home and watch scary movies?

20:14.266 --> 20:15.699
You want to?

20:15.767 --> 20:16.933
Yeah.

20:20.238 --> 20:21.838
You want us to stay home with you

20:21.907 --> 20:23.673
and watch scary movies

20:23.742 --> 20:26.042
while you cry about this stupid boy?

20:31.316 --> 20:32.549
Yeah.

20:32.617 --> 20:33.717
Okay.

20:33.785 --> 20:35.552
Oh, Mom, by the way,

20:35.620 --> 20:37.187
have you talked to Trieste lately?

20:37.255 --> 20:38.555
What?

20:38.623 --> 20:39.923
Well, I mean, I don't know.

20:39.991 --> 20:42.158
Just you brought her up the other day.

20:42.227 --> 20:45.061
Um, what the hell... Wait.

20:45.130 --> 20:46.496
What?

20:46.565 --> 20:48.098
Did you tell her

20:48.166 --> 20:49.566
that she could live with us

20:49.634 --> 20:52.035
and be your permanent tutor and person?

20:52.104 --> 20:53.903
Yes.

20:53.972 --> 20:56.206
Why on the planet

20:56.274 --> 20:57.874
would you tell somebody
something like that?

20:57.943 --> 21:02.712
Mom, Mom, I told her to
pretend to be a stalker.

21:02.781 --> 21:04.948
Did I get you or what?

21:05.016 --> 21:07.250
Oh, my God.

21:07.319 --> 21:09.185
What, Mom?

21:09.254 --> 21:11.921
- You little shit fink.
- Hey! No!

21:11.990 --> 21:13.423
- I can't believe you!
- Get off! Hey!

21:13.492 --> 21:15.058
I completely believed her.

21:15.127 --> 21:16.893
Yeah because she's a great actress.

21:16.962 --> 21:18.294
I think I got her fired.

21:18.363 --> 21:19.429
Ohh!

21:19.498 --> 21:20.730
Aah!

21:20.799 --> 21:23.366
What the hell!

21:23.435 --> 21:25.435
Hey! Ow!

21:25.504 --> 21:27.070
Don't hurt the angel!

21:27.139 --> 21:28.772
She's sad right now.

21:28.840 --> 21:29.739
Ow!

21:29.808 --> 21:31.307
She's sad right now.

21:32.511 --> 21:34.411
- Happier than me!
- Ow!

21:35.305 --> 21:41.398
