-Would anyone like a canape?
-No, Gertie, it's 2:00 in the morning.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.867
I would like a drink, though.

Thank you all for coming.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.208
I couldn't sleep,

that means you can't sleep either.

I've thought a lot about what the right
thing to do is regarding this picture.

And I refuse to let anybody
say a woman bankrupted her studio

00:55.430 --> 00:58.016
on a bad bet
because she followed her heart.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.393
We are not casting Camille Washington.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.229
The picture we're making is <i>Peg,</i>

01:04.647 --> 01:06.816

01:06.900 --> 01:10.153
-[Lon] It's the prudent move, Mrs. Amberg.
-No it isn't, it's wrong.

01:10.236 --> 01:13.573
Avis, the fact that you are
the first female in history

01:13.656 --> 01:16.576
to run a studio is exactly why
you should cast Camille.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.705
Walt Disney?
What did he put out last year?

01:20.830 --> 01:24.167
<i>Song of the South,</i>
a movie where slaves were so happy,

01:24.292 --> 01:26.586
they didn't even want to leave
the plantation.

01:26.669 --> 01:28.463
People are sick of this shit, Avis.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.298
Look at all the folks
that came out and picketed.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.342
[Avis] I was one of them.
I hated that movie.

01:32.425 --> 01:36.387
-It's a racist piece of trash.
-Then you understand that this town

01:36.513 --> 01:38.389
needs a swift kick in the pants.

01:38.473 --> 01:42.435
Maybe it takes a woman to show
there are other ways to make movies.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.897
Let's cut to the chase here.
What are you risking, really?

01:45.980 --> 01:47.816

01:47.899 --> 01:49.609
Yes, Lon, we all get that.

01:49.692 --> 01:52.779
No, I'm serious.
What are you risking personally?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.572
Ace is clearly not in good health.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.700
If he wakes up, finds out what you did,
divorces you, you still get half.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.745
Either way, Avis, you're fine.

02:01.538 --> 02:04.332
Look, that is a Gauguin, right?

02:04.582 --> 02:09.337
You could just sell that and live
comfortably until the day you die.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.880
And when that day comes,

02:10.964 --> 02:14.259
you could look back on your life
knowing you did the right thing.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.177
But if you don't do it,

02:16.636 --> 02:19.180
how many more years is it going to take

02:19.264 --> 02:22.517
before a colored actress
gets a goddamn lead in a movie?

12:07.518 --> 12:10.438
Every theater owner
in the state of Alabama...

12:12.022 --> 12:15.276
has now pulled <i>All Hands on Deck.</i>

12:15.359 --> 12:18.904
The picture will not recoup its budget,
though it might not have anyway.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.531
It's a terrible picture.

12:20.614 --> 12:23.159
I should probably take this time
to mention that

12:23.242 --> 12:26.412
Camille and I received
two very interesting telephone calls.

12:26.495 --> 12:31.792
The first was from Hattie McDaniel
saying congratulations.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.086
The second was...

12:34.170 --> 12:35.713
well, it was not so nice.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.673
[phone rings]

12:38.132 --> 12:40.217
You get on a bus to Los Angeles,

12:40.342 --> 12:42.845
you come to my house,
and you say that to my face.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.180
Now fuck off!

12:44.263 --> 12:45.556
[slams receiver]

12:45.890 --> 12:46.974
[crying]

12:48.434 --> 12:50.186
Who was that? What happened?

12:52.021 --> 12:54.482
-I presume he called her--
-Yes.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.275
He did.

12:58.652 --> 13:01.071
We'll move you onto the lot
while we're filming.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.115
You can take one of the bungalows.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.326
You will have full-time security.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.120
-Thank you, Mrs. Amberg.
-[Avis] We're moving forward.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.498
I will not be bullied.

13:14.460 --> 13:18.923
However, it is now clear that <i>Meg</i>
will not run in every theater.

13:19.006 --> 13:22.927
If we're to break even on this movie,
we have to do it on the cheap,

13:23.010 --> 13:24.178
all across the board.

13:24.762 --> 13:28.140
So, as we fill out the cast,
we use homegrown talent.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.936
Now, what roles still need to be filled?

13:32.436 --> 13:35.022
-Here she comes.
-She's gonna be...

13:36.398 --> 13:37.817
Here she is.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.697
-Hello, Jeanne, dear.
-Hello.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.282
-So nice to see you.
-Let's sit.

13:45.866 --> 13:47.952
Yes. Thank you, Avis,
for inviting me here.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.078
[Avis] Jeanne.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.582
-Well...
-Well, is it good news or bad news?

13:53.666 --> 13:54.583
[chuckles]

13:54.667 --> 14:00.214
I-- I had heard through the grapevine
that I might be up for a nice part in <i>Peg</i>

14:00.297 --> 14:02.424
and that now it's <i>Meg.</i>

14:02.508 --> 14:04.301
Jeanne, you know I think the world of you,

14:04.385 --> 14:06.387
which is why I wanted
to tell you this personally.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.639
Oh, God, yes, it's-- it's bad news.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.474
We were considering you
for a role in <i>Meg,</i>

14:10.558 --> 14:12.142
but we're going in a different direction.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.645
You're just not right
for that particular role.

14:16.856 --> 14:17.982
All right.

14:18.107 --> 14:21.402
Well... I appreciate you letting me know.

14:21.485 --> 14:24.238
All right. That's it?
You're not gonna put up a fight?

14:24.321 --> 14:27.575
What would you have me say?
Avis, cast me or I'll kill myself?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.743
I mean, this is your studio.

14:29.827 --> 14:33.831
You can cast whoever you want,
I'm just lucky to still be on contract.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.457
[Avis] Well, that's my point.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.626
Please sit down, you're making me nervous.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.629
Avis and I have thought a lot about you,
Jeanne.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.259
I know you feel neglected.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.386
You're a great actress.

14:47.469 --> 14:51.181
You're respected all across town,
but you've never really broken through,

14:51.432 --> 14:54.351
and here you are under contract,
just spinning your wheels.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.228
So you're going to fire me?

14:56.645 --> 14:57.563
No.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.648
I'm giving you a picture.

14:59.982 --> 15:04.778
A role that will finally do you justice
and take you to that next level.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.323
A juicy role that could win you the Oscar.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.951
I-- Is this is some kind of trick?

15:11.035 --> 15:12.161
No.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.039
It's not? But...

15:15.122 --> 15:16.832
-Is it Helen Keller?
-No.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.295
How would you like to play Lee Miller
in the Lee Miller biography?

15:21.378 --> 15:23.213
-Yes.
-[chuckling]

15:24.006 --> 15:26.091
I-- I actually don't know who she is.

15:26.175 --> 15:31.013
-Well, she was one of Man Ray's models.
-Then she became a war photographer.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.516
Thank you.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.938
I'm so moved that you would do
such a thing for me.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.024
That you would see me...

15:42.942 --> 15:45.110
and what I might be able to do.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.155
Thank you.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.034
-Wonderful, Jeanne.
-[Jeanne chuckles]

15:52.117 --> 15:53.661
[door jingling]

15:57.122 --> 15:59.333
Don't let Henry Willson
see you eating that.

16:03.754 --> 16:04.797
What's going on?

16:06.507 --> 16:10.552
I told myself if I got the part in your
movie I'd treat myself to some ice cream.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.764
I felt so down today, I thought,

16:13.847 --> 16:16.725
what the hell, I should treat myself
for trying, you know?

16:18.477 --> 16:20.104
I did the best I could. 

16:20.854 --> 16:23.023
Maybe if I just treat myself
every time I do that,

16:23.107 --> 16:26.026
-something will come of it.
-I'm glad you're treating yourself, Rock.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.197
Because you got a part in the movie.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.117
What?

16:33.534 --> 16:35.744
Now, it ain't much,
it's just a couple lines.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.080
You're gonna be a gas station attendant,
which...

16:38.497 --> 16:39.832
-Wha--?
-...is ironic.

16:39.915 --> 16:42.042
But you come back
in a dream sequence, too.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.169
-You ain't pulling my leg, are you?
-No!

16:44.253 --> 16:45.796
Congratulations, Rock.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.674
-[chuckles]
-Thank you so much, Archie.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.844
It's all coming true,
just like we had said.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.013
Yeah, I guess so.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.598
[chuckling]

17:00.894 --> 17:02.229
[man] What's the damage?

17:02.312 --> 17:05.315
Well, um,
you've gone up two trouser sizes,

17:05.399 --> 17:08.485
and your biceps are two inches smaller.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.904
-Jesus Christ.
-[man] That can't be right.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.449
I've been watching what I eat, Henry.
Just like we talked about.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.784
Uh-huh. And what exactly
have you been eating?

17:15.868 --> 17:18.495
Well, I live right down the street
from Pink's Hot Dogs, right?

17:18.871 --> 17:20.539
-Protein!
-Fuck me in the ass.

17:20.664 --> 17:24.084
You've got to be kidding. All that fat?
Do you know what, Guy Madison?

17:24.168 --> 17:28.380
If I had a gun, I would take it out
right now and blow my head off.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.300
Wait, but since we talked
about me trimming down a bit...

17:31.842 --> 17:33.343
I don't get those anymore.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.763
I just get milkshakes.

17:36.472 --> 17:38.807
How many milkshakes do you drink in a day,
Guy?

17:39.349 --> 17:40.893
I don't know. Maybe three?

17:40.976 --> 17:43.187
Phyllis, go down the street
and buy me a gun

17:43.270 --> 17:45.898
so I can stick it in my mouth
and end it all right now.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.775
-I'll trim down, I promise!
-You bet your ass

17:47.858 --> 17:49.735
you're gonna trim down.
Now get the fuck out of my office

17:49.818 --> 17:52.321
and go eat a fucking cobb salad
for once in your life.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.739
[Guy] I'm very sorry, sir.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.701
How is this my fucking life, Phyllis?

17:58.494 --> 18:01.538
Why is it that every one of my clients,
I got to be their fucking daddy?

18:01.663 --> 18:04.541
I gotta spoon-feed every one of these
thick fucking meatheads.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.710
They can't wipe their shitty asses
without me.

18:06.960 --> 18:07.961
Why is that?

18:09.546 --> 18:10.672
[Henry exhales]

18:11.590 --> 18:12.800
Well, sir...

18:13.133 --> 18:16.512
I think with these good-looking boys,
they get infantilized at an early age.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.182
Their parents don't raise them right.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.727
That's very astute, Miss Gates.

18:25.687 --> 18:26.772
That'll be all.

18:27.064 --> 18:27.940
Yes, sir.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.154
Oh, um...

18:34.571 --> 18:36.615
Rock Hudson is here to see you,
Mr. Willson.

18:36.698 --> 18:37.616
[under breath] Oh, God.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.118
-Yeah, send him in.
-Okay.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.664
Mmm.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.290
[knock at door]

18:47.501 --> 18:51.255
Why are you smiling like that?
It's four lines.

18:51.338 --> 18:54.842
Well, yeah, but it's four lines
in a major motion picture, Henry!

18:54.925 --> 18:56.385
-Uh, you know what, Rock?
-[chuckling]

18:56.468 --> 18:59.388
Let me pull you back down to the surface
of planet Earth for a moment, okay?

18:59.471 --> 19:02.099
Your screen test was
a fucking embarrassment,

19:02.182 --> 19:05.519
and the only reason they gave you a part
was because they felt sorry for you.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.566
Yeah, but...
but it's got to mean something, Henry.

19:10.774 --> 19:14.194
We still have a major problem, Rock,
and the problem is twofold.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.863
One: you cannot act,

19:15.946 --> 19:19.032
which would be fine if you could just
stand quietly in front of the camera

19:19.116 --> 19:19.950
and smile.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.661
But you can't because, number two,
your teeth are crooked.

19:22.744 --> 19:24.913
The spacing? That haunts my dreams.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.874
Those are not movie star teeth.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.334
Really?

19:29.877 --> 19:30.711
Yeah.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.881
So you know what you and me
are gonna do right now? Hm?

19:33.964 --> 19:36.466
I am gonna walk you down to the dentist,

19:36.550 --> 19:38.635
I am going to sit you in his chair,

19:38.719 --> 19:42.806
and I am gonna hold you by the hand
while he makes your teeth perfect, got it?

19:42.890 --> 19:46.143
We're gonna take the leap
into leading-man territory.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.314
Henry, I'm-- I'm afraid of dentists.

19:52.524 --> 19:53.483
No shit.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.576
Henry!

20:02.659 --> 20:03.660
[elevator dings]

20:03.785 --> 20:05.287
[man] Dan Seeley, transportation.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.039
[man 2] Gregory Hall, lead gaffer.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.582
Carl Williams, grip department.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.209
And I'm Raymond Ainsley, the director.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.085
Let's make a picture called <i>Meg.</i>

20:17.466 --> 20:19.468
I don't know why you're all applauding,

20:20.302 --> 20:22.429
I've asked for budgets
from all departments,

20:22.512 --> 20:24.723
and every one of you is over.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.809
One hundred thousand dollars over,
to be specific.

20:27.893 --> 20:31.438
Until you all come in on budget,
this film is not going to get made,

20:31.521 --> 20:34.316
so I would hold the applause
if I were you.

20:34.399 --> 20:38.320
I think that number might reflect
what we may need

20:38.445 --> 20:40.864
to make this picture
the way I want to make it.

20:40.948 --> 20:44.243
With all due respect, Mr. Ainsley,
you don't know what you need.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.996
Greens department, $30,000.

20:48.080 --> 20:53.669
Do you think plants waving in
the background warrants 10% of the budget?

20:53.752 --> 20:57.923
No, um, Mr. Samuels...
I can get that down.

20:58.548 --> 20:59.716
[Dick] Hair.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.927
I mean, what the fuck, Sharon?

21:02.010 --> 21:05.514
Well, okay, yes, that number reflects
four stylists most days.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.182
How about just one? What's that number?

21:07.266 --> 21:08.517
Yes, that's...

21:09.434 --> 21:11.186
That's a much smaller number.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.480
-I'll get into it.
-[Dick] Good.

21:13.563 --> 21:16.566
Before I forget, let's have a working
dinner. I want to go over the script.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.778
Sure. I thought you said the script
was in good shape.

21:19.861 --> 21:22.406
It is. "Good" can always be "better."

21:23.615 --> 21:24.908
All right?

21:30.998 --> 21:33.792
He just never ceases to dazzle,
that Richard.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.128
Such a natural leader.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.672
So exacting, you know?

21:39.673 --> 21:43.385
This is a man who believes that
greatness comes from refinement.

21:43.468 --> 21:46.138
-You're in love with him, aren't you?
-No.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.848
There's nothing wrong with that.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.684
Ask him out on a date. See what he says.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.520
Avis, I-- I've forgotten how.

21:53.603 --> 21:57.649
You know, the last man I went
on a date with was Lon Chaney.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.359
Lon Chaney? Jesus, Ellen.

21:59.776 --> 22:03.530
Besides, you know, I...
I just love my studio life.

22:03.613 --> 22:04.489
I love it.

22:04.573 --> 22:10.203
I work my tail off and I leave here
every evening... satisfied.

22:10.287 --> 22:13.498
I am content to spend my evenings
reading scripts

22:13.582 --> 22:17.210
and munching on stupid Ritz crackers
by the fireside.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.462
Listen to you!

22:18.545 --> 22:22.341
Wouldn't it be nice to cuddle up at night
to someone you love?

22:23.008 --> 22:25.052
Well, of course it would be, but...

22:28.388 --> 22:29.973
Is Richard the one?

22:30.474 --> 22:31.516
You know...

22:33.226 --> 22:35.520
he is the subject of occasional rumors.

22:36.271 --> 22:39.232
Yes, I've heard that he's a certain way,
but I've never seen it.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.693
-No.
-After all these years, wouldn't we know?

22:41.777 --> 22:43.779
Yes, I mean, you'd think we would.

22:45.655 --> 22:46.823
How about this...

22:48.533 --> 22:50.202
-The Lee Miller script...
-Mm-hmm.

22:50.285 --> 22:52.537
You tell him you
want to talk through some casting ideas.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.247
-Mm-hmm.
-Make him dinner,

22:54.331 --> 22:57.209
and after a few drinks,
make your move.

22:58.835 --> 22:59.878
Oh, God.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.464
Oh, what if he were just horrified?

23:02.547 --> 23:03.882
No. I-- I really, I...

23:03.965 --> 23:06.676
I, honestly-- I don't think
I would survive the embarrassment.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.888
Ellen, the last thing I want
is for you to get hurt,

23:10.555 --> 23:13.308
but you've been standing
on the precipice forever.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.230
[laughing]

23:18.438 --> 23:20.524
Oh, God. Don't laugh.

23:21.608 --> 23:22.651
Stop it.

23:23.318 --> 23:24.820
Oh, my God.

23:25.612 --> 23:28.115
I'm Claire Wood, I play Sarah Wadsworth.

23:29.533 --> 23:33.537
Hi, Jack Castello.
I play Sam Harrington, the romantic lead.

23:34.371 --> 23:37.666
Hi, I am Camille Washington
and I play Meg Ennis.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.420
I am Anna May Wong.

23:44.714 --> 23:45.757
Thank you.

23:46.967 --> 23:51.513
I also never believed I would be sitting
at one of these tables again.

23:52.973 --> 23:56.226
I am very happy to be playing
the role of Caroline.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.814
And I'm Archie Coleman, screenwriter.

24:06.236 --> 24:09.990
All right, that's everyone.
Let's dive right in, shall we? <i>"Meg...</i>

24:11.116 --> 24:13.285
screenplay by Archie Coleman."

24:14.911 --> 24:17.581
"Interior, Broadway theater, night.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.500
The curtain opens on the Broadway play.

24:20.584 --> 24:23.336
In the audience,
we see a young woman of color, Meg,

24:23.420 --> 24:25.088
seated in the front row.

24:25.505 --> 24:27.340
Applause as Caroline Lee walks on stage.

24:27.424 --> 24:30.218
She takes a bow and locks eyes
with the girl in the front row.

24:31.219 --> 24:34.598
A moment, then the play begins
as camera holds on Meg's face.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.641
A stage actress speaks to Caroline."

24:36.725 --> 24:37.893
How long have you been here?

24:38.351 --> 24:39.561
I just came in.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.980
-What do you want?
-I don't want anything.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.815
I was told to wait at this place.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.817
"The audience laughing all around her,

24:45.901 --> 24:49.488
[fading] Meg just stares as we cut
to exterior, stage door, night...

24:49.613 --> 24:53.783
The crazed look now absent from her eyes,
Meg stares up in awe

24:53.867 --> 24:57.913
at the Hollywoodland sign in front of her,
struck by its majesty."

24:57.996 --> 24:59.706
[Camille] There you are, old friend.

25:00.248 --> 25:02.209
Somehow I always knew
it would end up this way.

25:02.292 --> 25:03.376
[Archie] "Dissolve to:

25:03.960 --> 25:06.046
Meg's hands grasp the scaffolding

25:06.129 --> 25:08.924
as she climbs up the backside
of the enormous H.

25:09.382 --> 25:12.511
As she reaches the top,
wind whipping her hair,

25:12.594 --> 25:15.555
her eyes welling with tears,
she spots Sam

25:15.639 --> 25:17.265
emerging from the shadows below."

25:17.349 --> 25:19.351
Sam, what are you doing here?

25:19.935 --> 25:23.021
Leave me alone, this is my destiny,
mine and mine alone.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.774
[Jack] Meg, I won't let you do it.

25:26.316 --> 25:29.569
You know I love you and you know
I won't let you throw it all away.

25:29.653 --> 25:32.572
I can't, Sam.
I can't! I can't do it anymore.

25:32.864 --> 25:35.575
[Archie] "Close on Meg's foot as it slips.
She catches herself."

25:35.659 --> 25:38.245
[Jack] What did you tell me
about killing yourself?

25:38.328 --> 25:41.831
When all those Wall Street so-and-so's
lost their fortunes and ended it all,

25:42.290 --> 25:45.835
you said, "Sam, they picked a long-term
solution to a short-term problem."

25:45.961 --> 25:47.879
Well, that's what you're doing now, Meg. 

25:48.421 --> 25:49.464
Goodbye, Sam.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.174
Goodbye to it all.

25:52.425 --> 25:53.510
I'm so sorry.

25:54.135 --> 25:56.888
"Meg jumps from the sign. As she falls--"

25:56.972 --> 25:59.933
-No!
-"Sam falls to his knees, weeping."

26:00.016 --> 26:02.143
[Jack] Meg! Meg, why! Why?

26:02.602 --> 26:04.145
Why couldn't I save you? 

26:04.312 --> 26:09.067
[Archie] "Close on Meg, her body twisted
and lifeless at the foot of the H.

26:09.150 --> 26:10.735
Her eyes open,

26:10.819 --> 26:13.863
staring up at the moonless night
full of stars,

26:13.947 --> 26:17.200
camera cranes up and pans out
to the city lights of Hollywood below

26:17.284 --> 26:21.663
as the wail of a distant police siren
echos into the night

26:22.414 --> 26:23.999
as we cut to black.

26:24.541 --> 26:25.584
The end."

26:34.342 --> 26:36.469
Bravo, everybody. How about that, huh?

26:37.304 --> 26:38.888
Um, thank you very much.

26:38.972 --> 26:39.931
Wonderful work.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.019
Let's take five,
and then we'll start rehearsing.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.609
Camille, that was...

26:51.818 --> 26:54.321
-That was fantastic.
-[Camille] Thank you.

26:54.404 --> 26:57.282
So were you, I mean, it's actually--
it's a really good part.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.659
That ending, though.
It breaks your heart, doesn't it?

27:01.995 --> 27:06.583
I just wonder, aren't people going to know
ahead of time how it ends, though?

27:07.083 --> 27:08.460
That she kills herself?

27:09.878 --> 27:11.087
Fill her up, ma'am?

27:11.671 --> 27:12.631
Fill her up, ma'am?

27:12.714 --> 27:15.759
Of course I'd give directions
to a pretty gal like you.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.762
Just head up to Franklin Avenue,
take a left, and shoot up Beachwood Drive.

27:18.845 --> 27:22.223
You'll see the Hollywoodland sign
at the top of the hill, big as anything.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.975
-Hey. Hey, Rock.
-Big as anything!

27:24.059 --> 27:26.269
You-- you look different.
You get a haircut or something?

27:26.561 --> 27:28.271
-No.
-Looks great, whatever it is.

27:28.396 --> 27:30.982
Listen, I wanted to tell you,
boy, are you terrific!

27:31.232 --> 27:33.360
You really think so? I wasn't overacting?

27:33.443 --> 27:36.446
No, no. It was great.
Very natural sounding.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.698
Well, thanks, Jack.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.368
You, too. You're gonna be a real star,
you know.

27:41.493 --> 27:42.327
[Jack scoffs]

27:42.410 --> 27:45.955
No, you are. I'm just happy to feel
like a part of something.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.582
Like I got a family, you know?

27:48.041 --> 27:49.959
Yeah, I know what you mean.

27:50.877 --> 27:52.003
It's nice, ain't it?

27:53.046 --> 27:55.298
Yeah. That ending, though, it's...

27:55.715 --> 27:56.883
It's real sad.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.387
You know, I keep whispering
under my breath,

28:00.553 --> 28:01.763
"Don't do it, Meg.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.390
Don't do it."

28:03.598 --> 28:04.933
Yeah, but...

28:05.558 --> 28:08.478
you know, that's what happened,
so, that sort of...

28:08.770 --> 28:09.979
No way around it, you know?

28:11.356 --> 28:12.482
-Yeah.
-[Raymond] <i>I mean...</i>

28:12.565 --> 28:14.067
-[Archie] Camille.
-[Raymond] Wonderful.

28:14.150 --> 28:16.569
-And Anna May Wong, she was fantastic.
-[Dick] Mm-hmm.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.364
She's only in a couple of scenes,
but it just kind of worked.

28:20.115 --> 28:20.990
Good. Good.

28:21.658 --> 28:26.204
All right, let's just do a page turn,
and I'll tell you my thoughts as we go.

28:26.746 --> 28:28.289
First thing, page three.

28:29.457 --> 28:31.584
Meg meets Caroline Lee at stage door.

28:32.293 --> 28:34.379
Why? What's this scene saying?

28:35.088 --> 28:39.217
Well, uh, she's meeting this Broadway star
who becomes her idol.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.385
Mm-hmm.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.887
That's very important.
I don't want to change that.

28:43.304 --> 28:47.308
I've gone page by page with writers
through hundreds of scripts,

28:47.434 --> 28:51.312
and the instinct,
especially for a young writer,

28:51.396 --> 28:54.774
is to get defensive.
When I have a question about something,

28:54.858 --> 28:57.527
it means that there's something
that's not there,

28:57.610 --> 29:01.865
something that you might
do well to flesh out.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.283
Yes?

29:04.117 --> 29:07.537
As for the scene on page three...

29:08.455 --> 29:11.750
Uh, Caroline has just finished the play,
and she's alcoholic, yes?

29:11.833 --> 29:13.710
Which means that she's probably
had a drink.

29:13.793 --> 29:15.920
And Meg, when she meets her,

29:16.296 --> 29:18.506
might smell it on her breath,
wouldn't she?

29:24.512 --> 29:26.639
Yeah. Yeah, it's--

29:27.098 --> 29:29.267
Yeah. That's actually a really good idea.

29:29.350 --> 29:31.144
[Dick] Okay, scene in the gas station.

29:31.227 --> 29:33.229
Let's put this in the bar,
make Rock the bartender.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.440
He still tells her
how to get up to the sign...

29:35.523 --> 29:37.442
Okay. Final scene.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.653
This girl that we've spent
the whole movie rooting for

29:40.737 --> 29:42.697
jumps off the Hollywoodland sign.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.616
Kills herself. Credits roll.

29:44.699 --> 29:45.950
-[Raymond] Right.
-[Archie] Yeah.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.495
What are we saying here?

29:49.871 --> 29:50.955
[Archie] Um...

29:51.456 --> 29:52.665
Well...

29:52.749 --> 29:53.792
it's...

29:56.336 --> 29:57.587
To me, it's like...

29:58.797 --> 29:59.964
It's as if she was...

30:00.381 --> 30:01.508
[Archie grunts]

30:02.342 --> 30:03.843
-It's sad.
-It's sad.

30:03.927 --> 30:05.428
[Archie] That's kind of the point.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.722
-You know, like Meg is a stand-in...
-[Dick] Mm-hmm.

30:07.806 --> 30:11.684
...for all of the thousands and thousands
of people that come to this town.

30:12.435 --> 30:15.063
Now, they come here with their dreams,
and those dreams are dashed.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.648
-They come--
-Okay, so she's a stand-in

30:16.731 --> 30:19.317
for countless other girls.
It's a trope, really.

30:19.442 --> 30:22.445
She's this troubled white girl
who's so beaten down

30:22.529 --> 30:24.948
that she decides to end it all, right?

30:27.742 --> 30:31.621
-But... she isn't white anymore.
-Exactly.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.957
So it's no longer a trope.

30:34.040 --> 30:37.168
Instead, it's a new story
about a colored girl who...

30:37.252 --> 30:41.631
worked and worked and worked,
and she never got the career she deserved,

30:42.507 --> 30:45.385
so she decides to stop fighting
and end it all.

30:45.468 --> 30:47.554
That's-- that's troubling to me.

30:48.596 --> 30:52.559
This picture starts with a young Meg
looking up at a stage.

30:53.518 --> 30:57.856
Well, what are we saying
to a young colored girl looking up at Meg,

30:57.939 --> 30:59.566
up there on the screen?

30:59.774 --> 31:02.318
Oh, fight for a while, but then give up.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.280
Mmm.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.323
What if she doesn't jump?

31:11.452 --> 31:13.746
What if she climbs back down?

31:14.289 --> 31:16.207
She takes her boyfriend's hand...

31:16.541 --> 31:18.877
and we know she's gone to the brink,
but...

31:19.377 --> 31:20.545
she survived it.

31:22.171 --> 31:24.674
-She gonna be all right.
-[Raymond] That's a...

31:25.758 --> 31:27.552
that's a very different movie.

31:27.635 --> 31:28.928
It's a better movie.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.063
[Ellen] Is he in? I just need a word.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.190
Uh, sorry to interrupt, Dick.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.568
Have you got anything on the books
for Friday night?

31:43.651 --> 31:44.861
I don't think so, why?

31:44.986 --> 31:48.239
Well, Avis is pounding on
the Lee Miller script for Jeanne Crandall.

31:48.323 --> 31:52.201
I know you're working with the writer,
but that picture has about 100 characters.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.828
Come over to the house Friday.

31:53.912 --> 31:57.081
I'll cook us up something,
and we can steal a march on the casting.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.250
-Okay. What time?
-Say, 8:00?

31:59.792 --> 32:00.919
-Good.
-Good.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.630
Um... Avis needs to see you both.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.340
She said it's urgent.

32:05.423 --> 32:06.382
[Ellen] Mm.

32:09.135 --> 32:11.387
[Dick] Well, this isn't good.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.973
So, we're sure
<i>Tattletale Magazine</i> has this.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.059
Yes, Ellen,
I just got off the phone with them.

32:16.142 --> 32:17.644
They're running it on Friday.

32:17.727 --> 32:19.604
And what exactly are they running?

32:20.146 --> 32:21.105
I was, uh...

32:22.357 --> 32:23.775
arrested for...

32:23.983 --> 32:25.777
[voice trembling] ...um, solicitation.

32:26.402 --> 32:30.156
I was working at the gas station,
and I didn't know she was vice squad.

32:30.239 --> 32:31.908
[Ellen] Oh, dear.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.993
[shuddered breathing] I'm sorry, I just...

32:34.077 --> 32:37.455
I knew it was wrong,
and now it's ruining everything, and...

32:39.374 --> 32:40.625
You all took a chance on me.

32:40.708 --> 32:43.252
-Hush now, come on.
-No, I'm so sorry, Mrs. Amberg.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.504
You must hate me.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.255
Please stop crying.

32:47.340 --> 32:48.299
I don't hate you.

32:50.134 --> 32:51.219
I myself have...

32:52.929 --> 32:56.224
Well, you know, I've been known
to frequent that station.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.768
I'm surprised I never saw you there.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.063
Well, it's out there now.

33:02.188 --> 33:04.649
[Avis] Why does anyone even care?

33:04.732 --> 33:06.150
[shouts] This fucking town!

33:06.234 --> 33:08.069
I think we know who we have to call.

33:08.152 --> 33:09.988
-I already did.
-Sorry I'm late.

33:10.071 --> 33:13.157
Should have taken Fountain.
So, what are we looking at here?

33:13.241 --> 33:14.534
Mugshot is on the table.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.828
Vice squad picked him up for solicitation.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.250
Jack?

33:23.167 --> 33:24.585
Jack Castello.

33:25.044 --> 33:27.296
-Henry Willson.
-Hi.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.465
We met at George's party. George Cukor?

33:30.091 --> 33:31.092
Yeah, I remember.

33:31.217 --> 33:34.846
[Henry] Oh, yeah.
We had a long talk about morality. 

33:34.929 --> 33:37.515
So, this is... [chuckles]

33:37.598 --> 33:39.684
This is ironic.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.646
I know who did this.

33:44.230 --> 33:46.441
Dean Wharton, freelance reporter.

33:46.774 --> 33:48.359
How do you know that?

33:48.443 --> 33:51.029
Honey, I got a finger
in every stink hole in town.

33:51.446 --> 33:55.742
You see, Dean Wharton has something in
common with the publisher of <i>Tattletale.</i>

33:55.825 --> 33:58.661
They don't like Jews
and they don't like women.

33:58.745 --> 34:01.247
So, probably not big fans
of you running this studio.

34:01.956 --> 34:04.709
Look, I'll quit. I'll move back home,
you can recast the picture.

34:04.792 --> 34:05.710
Shut up.

34:08.296 --> 34:09.589
Leave it to Uncle Henry.

34:09.672 --> 34:10.923
I'll need a week.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.051
They're going to print on Friday.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.681
Well, then, you'll owe me big, won't you?

34:19.724 --> 34:22.852
[Raymond] Oh boy, what do you know
about that? Hey, fellas.

34:23.144 --> 34:24.896
[Sam] So, what do you think?

34:24.979 --> 34:26.189
It's fantastic.

34:26.689 --> 34:27.774
Is that what it looked like?

34:27.857 --> 34:31.402
Yeah. In '24 the sign was
a little weathered, but, uh, still new,

34:31.486 --> 34:34.280
nothing like it is now.
We couldn't build the whole thing, so...

34:34.447 --> 34:37.492
this'll pretty much play
when she's standing up at the top

34:37.742 --> 34:39.702
and then the reverse of Sam screaming,
"No!"

34:40.078 --> 34:41.496
and falling to his knees crying,

34:41.579 --> 34:43.873
and then the tilt up to the city lights.

34:44.749 --> 34:45.917
Yeah, I like that.

34:48.544 --> 34:51.339
I got a location right in front
of Griffith Observatory.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.716
Great, great views of the city.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.384
[Raymond] Uh-huh. And, uh...

34:56.219 --> 34:57.345
Wait, hang on...

34:57.428 --> 34:59.388
Uh, how does she climb up?

34:59.472 --> 35:01.432
[Sam] Well, Peg Entwistle used a ladder.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.643
I mean, the script says
she climbs up the scaffolding.

35:03.726 --> 35:06.270
-That's right, so where's the scaffolding?
-[Sam] Well...

35:06.354 --> 35:07.355
But she used a ladder.

35:07.605 --> 35:09.232
I just figured budget, as it is,

35:09.315 --> 35:11.150
you get a tight shot of a hand
grabbing a rung,

35:11.234 --> 35:13.194
-then cut to her standing up at the top.
-[Raymond] Yeah.

35:13.277 --> 35:15.488
Uh, that's not exactly the most
dramatic choice, is it?

35:16.614 --> 35:18.991
And-- and how's she supposed
to climb down?

35:19.075 --> 35:20.493
-Doesn't she jump?
-[Raymond] No.

35:20.576 --> 35:22.995
No, she doesn't jump.
We're changing that.

35:23.079 --> 35:25.665
She decides not to jump,
and then she climbs down,

35:25.748 --> 35:28.793
and I didn't think that'd be an issue,
because I thought there'd be scaffolding.

35:28.876 --> 35:31.629
How's she supposed to climb down now?
What am I supposed to do?

35:31.712 --> 35:32.964
How am I supposed to shoot that?

35:33.047 --> 35:35.675
What? She went up there,
and she throws a rope ladder off

35:35.758 --> 35:38.219
-and climbs down the front of the sign?
-Yeah, that'll work.

35:38.302 --> 35:41.848
No, it won't work, Sam,
'cause she went up there to kill herself.

35:42.265 --> 35:45.768
She didn't just bring a goddamn
rope ladder with her in her purse!

35:46.102 --> 35:48.563
We need to shoot both sides of the sign,

35:48.646 --> 35:50.982
and there needs to be scaffolding
that she can both climb up

35:51.065 --> 35:52.233
and climb down safely.

35:52.316 --> 35:57.780
And the camera cannot point
at this bare section of the sound stage.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.115
Somebody's gotta dress this.

35:59.198 --> 36:01.033
-No, but see, Mr. Ainsley...
-[Raymond sighs]

36:01.117 --> 36:04.245
Look, building this sign took
every penny in my budget.

36:04.328 --> 36:07.456
I mean, you're talking about,
I don't know,

36:07.540 --> 36:10.084
$25,000 to change it.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.169
Fine.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.796
We don't really have a choice.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.968
Just fix it! You two, come on.

36:26.517 --> 36:27.602
Hello.

36:28.352 --> 36:30.521
Mickey, I am so sorry I'm late.

36:30.605 --> 36:31.856
Hi, how are you doing?

36:32.899 --> 36:33.983
I tell you,

36:34.609 --> 36:35.610
one of my clients...

36:35.902 --> 36:39.739
he finds a wart on his knob.
Turns out he's got syphilis.

36:39.822 --> 36:41.324
I had to take him to the doctor.

36:41.407 --> 36:43.784
You know, they say you got
to get penicillin for that.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.620
-[Henry] That's what I hear.
-I had the drip once.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.288
-That right?
-After a while, it went away.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.123
Oh, that'd be nice.

36:49.415 --> 36:50.625
What can I get you gentlemen?

36:50.708 --> 36:53.836
Can we get two bowls of spaghetti,
a Creme de Menthe for myself

36:53.920 --> 36:55.963
and a glass of Lambrusco
for the gentleman.

36:57.423 --> 36:58.382
I get that right?

36:58.549 --> 37:00.343
-You got a good memory.
-Yeah.

in the midst of all that horror
