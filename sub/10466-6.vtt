LOOK, MOMMY!

00:06.093 --> 00:08.095
OH, BAILEY,
WILL YOU SWING ME?

00:08.095 --> 00:11.098
PUT IT UP JUST FOR
THE NATMEISTER.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.925
OK, THERE'S GOT
TO BE ANOTHER SHOE,

00:12.925 --> 00:14.231
SIZE 13.

00:14.231 --> 00:16.277
GOING TO DROP IT
RIGHT ON MY HEAD.

00:16.277 --> 00:18.844
WHAT?
I FOUND IT IN
THE BASEMENT.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.237
HIGHER, BAILEY.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.111
HEY, NAT,

00:24.111 --> 00:25.460
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL BAILEY

00:25.460 --> 00:27.114
WHAT YOU GET TO DO
TOMORROW NIGHT?

00:27.114 --> 00:29.072
SLEEP OVER AT
MADELINE'S HOUSE.

00:29.072 --> 00:31.683
SO MOMMY CAN COOK
DINNER FOR YOU.

00:31.683 --> 00:33.294
REALLY?
NAT!

00:33.294 --> 00:36.471
IS THAT THE PART
I WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO SAY?

00:36.471 --> 00:38.081
YEP. BUT,
HEY, IT'S OK.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.474
IT'S OK, SWEETIE.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.476
UM, I WAS GOING TO--

00:41.476 --> 00:43.869
UH, IF YOU'RE FREE?

00:43.869 --> 00:44.957

00:44.957 --> 00:47.351
ARE YOU ASKING ME OUT?

00:47.351 --> 00:48.700
TOMORROW?

00:48.700 --> 00:50.311
YOU WANNA?

00:51.573 --> 00:53.357
TOMORROW.

00:53.357 --> 00:54.837
YEAH, I--

00:56.143 --> 00:57.535
I WANNA.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.325
HIGHER, BAILEY, HIGHER.

01:10.592 --> 01:13.160
"BICENTENNIAL SURF
AND TURF SPECIAL FOR 2

01:13.160 --> 01:14.857
ONLY 17.76."

01:16.380 --> 01:17.947
SAVE OR TOSS?

01:17.947 --> 01:19.601
GOT TO BE BRUTAL.

01:19.601 --> 01:20.993
ONE FOR
THE SCRAPBOOK,

01:20.993 --> 01:22.517
THE REST TO
THE RECYCLER.

01:22.517 --> 01:23.996
FUNNY HOW THINGS WORK OUT.

01:23.996 --> 01:26.608
I MEAN, MY GRANDPARENTS
ACTUALLY BROUGHT ME HERE

01:26.608 --> 01:27.957
WHEN I WAS A KID.

01:27.957 --> 01:30.002
AND NOW, HERE WE ARE.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.613
SMALL WORLD, HUH?

01:31.613 --> 01:34.094
OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW,
I PROBABLY EVEN SAW YOU.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.052
ISN'T THAT WEIRD
TO THINK ABOUT,

01:36.052 --> 01:38.010
THAT WHOLE SHIPS
IN THE NIGHT THING?

01:38.010 --> 01:39.621
HOW 2 PEOPLE
WHO HAVE NEVER MET,

01:39.621 --> 01:41.013
BUT ARE DESTINED TO MEET,

01:41.013 --> 01:42.972
MIGHT'VE ALMOST MET
SEVERAL TIMES.

01:42.972 --> 01:44.626
AND THEN, WELL,
ONE THING LEADS
TO ANOTHER.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.628
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN--

01:46.628 --> 01:49.196
THEY'RE LOCKED
IN A STOREROOM?

01:49.196 --> 01:50.849
YOU MEAN WE'RE TRAPPED?

01:50.849 --> 01:52.460
THE WORKERS
WILL LET US OUT.

01:52.460 --> 01:53.983
WAIT.
WAIT JUST A SECOND.

01:53.983 --> 01:57.421
WHAT IF
WE WERE TRAPPED?

01:57.421 --> 01:58.727
BUT WE'RE...

02:04.298 --> 02:05.386
TRAPPED.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.518
DEFINITELY TRAPPED.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.139
GREAT, BUT,

02:19.139 --> 02:22.098
UM, WHAT ABOUT,
YOU KNOW.

02:22.098 --> 02:23.795
'CAUSE I DON'T ACTUALLY
CARRY ONE IN MY WALLET.

02:23.795 --> 02:24.840
I DO.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.755
SINCE OUR THIRD DATE.

02:26.755 --> 02:28.322
WELL, SHOOT ME,

02:28.322 --> 02:30.628

03:10.755 --> 03:13.454
OK, I--I THINK
I HAVE AN ANSWER.

03:13.454 --> 03:15.064
WAS THERE A QUESTION?

03:15.064 --> 03:17.414
WELL, TO WHAT
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.416
DUH.
ABOUT TO KILL
A MOCKINGBIRD.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.766
SO ANYWAY, I REREAD
IT LAST NIGHT AND--

03:21.766 --> 03:23.768
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:23.768 --> 03:26.989

LAST NIGHT?

03:26.989 --> 03:28.556
OK, I SKIMMED.
ANYWAY--

03:28.556 --> 03:30.079
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:30.079 --> 03:31.994
BEFORE YOU GET ME
ALL INTERESTED,

03:31.994 --> 03:33.517
I CAN'T DO THIS TODAY.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.215
BUT WE DO THIS
EVERY DAY.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.825
I KNOW.

03:36.825 --> 03:39.088
BUT MY DAD SAT ME DOWN
LAST NIGHT,

03:39.088 --> 03:41.046
AND HE SAID THAT
I HAD TO GET A JOB, SO...

03:41.046 --> 03:43.048
A JOB?YEAH.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.137
I HAVE AN INTERVIEW
AT THE SHOE SHACK.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.791
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.489
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE, LIKE,

03:48.489 --> 03:50.012
WORKING EVERY DAY
AFTER SCHOOL?

03:50.012 --> 03:51.013
PRETTY MUCH.

03:51.013 --> 03:53.320
SO, I MEAN,

03:53.320 --> 03:55.974
MAYBE WE CAN E-MAIL
OR SOMETHING.

03:57.411 --> 03:58.760
CIAO.

04:03.112 --> 04:04.592
CIAO.

04:04.592 --> 04:05.810
WHAT IS THIS STUFF?

04:05.810 --> 04:07.072
SUSHI.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.291
THE CHEF CALLS IT
ISHY MISHY.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.466
I CALL IT GROSS.

04:09.466 --> 04:10.859
SINCE WHEN ARE
WE JAPANESE?

04:10.859 --> 04:12.556
Charlie:
IT'S ONE APPETIZER.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.166
I GOT TO TRY SOME NEW THINGS
FOR THE REOPENING.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.385
I DON'T KNOW,
I KIND OF LIKE IT.

04:15.385 --> 04:16.778
YOU GUYS JUST
DON'T APPRECIATE

04:16.778 --> 04:18.606
REAL GOURMET COOKING,
YOU KNOW THAT?

04:18.606 --> 04:19.868
I'D APPRECIATE IT
MORE IF IT WAS
ACTUALLY COOKED.

04:19.868 --> 04:21.261
HEY, CHARLIE,

04:21.261 --> 04:23.306
YOU'RE PROBABLY
GOING TO BE HIRING

04:23.306 --> 04:26.091
SOME BUSBOYS OR
DISHWASHERS WHEN
YOU OPEN, RIGHT?

04:26.091 --> 04:27.963
NOT REALLY.
IT'S COVERED.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.921
HEY, DON'T EAT ALL
THE ISHY MISHY.

04:29.921 --> 04:32.097
TRY THE, UH,

04:32.097 --> 04:33.229

ROLLS.

04:33.229 --> 04:35.187
SORRY, I DON'T DO SEAWEED.

04:35.187 --> 04:37.146
YOU'VE GOT RICE
IN YOUR HAIR.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.408
I DO?

04:38.408 --> 04:40.454
MM-HMM.THAT'S WEIRD.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.673
HEY, CHARLIE,
THIS REOPENING THING.

04:42.673 --> 04:45.720
IS THAT JUST FOR FAMILY
OR CAN WE INVITE SOMEBODY?

04:45.720 --> 04:48.113
WHAT, YOU HAVE TO ASK
TO BRING SARAH?

04:48.113 --> 04:51.116
HEY, WHO ATE ALL THE SAUCE?

04:51.116 --> 04:53.858
OH, I'M SORRY.
IT WAS GOOD.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.686
Bailey: ACTUALLY,
UM, I WAS GOING TO--

04:55.686 --> 04:57.384
AS I WAS SAYING,
ARE YOU SURE

04:57.384 --> 04:58.994
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BE HIRING
ANY PART-TIMERS?

04:58.994 --> 05:00.691
YOU LOOKING
FOR A JOB, CLAUD?

05:00.691 --> 05:02.563
FOR A FRIEND.
I WAS GOING TO
TELL YOU GUYS--

05:02.563 --> 05:03.912
GRIFFIN'S
CLEAN UP GUY
JUST QUIT.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.435
YOU CAN
USE SOMEONE,
RIGHT, GRIFFIN?

05:05.435 --> 05:07.655
I GUESS SO.REALLY?

05:07.655 --> 05:09.439
'CAUSE YOU COULD
HIRE THIS GUY, GRIFFIN.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.962
HIS NAME'S REED ISLEY,

05:10.962 --> 05:12.964
AND HE'S SMART AND CUTE.

05:12.964 --> 05:15.184
WELL, NOT THAT CUTE
WOULD BE ANY REASON
TO HIRE HIM, BUT--

05:15.184 --> 05:16.707
Julia: CUTE?
REED ISLEY?
HE'S A SENIOR.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.709
HE'S, LIKE,
SOME BIG,
DUMB JOCK.

05:18.709 --> 05:19.928
HE'S NOT DUMB.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.495
YOU HAVE A CRUSH
ON REED ISLEY?

05:21.495 --> 05:22.713
NO. NO.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.628
HE'S JUST A FRIEND.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.848
Julia: UH-HUH.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.458
SAVE SOME FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.504
WANT SOME MORE OF THIS?

05:30.504 --> 05:32.375
Julia:
HE DOES NOT HATE YOU.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.116
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THE GUY'S SAID
5 WORDS TO ME

05:34.116 --> 05:35.900
THE WHOLE TIME
I'VE KNOWN HIM.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.337
4 WERE BEFORE
WE GOT MARRIED.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.642
AND HE MAKES ME
SIT AT THE KIDS
TABLE.

05:38.642 --> 05:39.861
HE DIDN'T MAKE YOU.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.732
"YOU'RE SITTING
HERE, GRIFFIN."

05:41.732 --> 05:43.908
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
WE'RE MARRIED, FOR GOD SAKE.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.736
HE LETS
HIS GIRLFRIEND
SIT AT THE BOOTH.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.434
YOU WANT TO SIT
AT THE BOOTH?

05:47.434 --> 05:49.131
NEXT TIME, WE'LL TRADE.
YOU CAN SIT AT THE BOOTH.

05:49.131 --> 05:51.002
THAT IS NOT
THE POINT,
ALL RIGHT?

05:51.002 --> 05:52.569
UNLESS HE'S YELLING
AT ME FOR EATING
TOO MUCH FOOD,

05:52.569 --> 05:54.049
THE GUY ACTS LIKE
I'M NOT EVEN AROUND.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.572
HE HATES THE FACT
THAT WE'RE MARRIED.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.574
WHAT? THAT'S NOT--

05:57.574 --> 06:00.403
GRIFFIN, CHARLIE
JUST HAS A LOT GOING ON
RIGHT NOW, THAT'S ALL.

06:00.403 --> 06:01.926
HE'S GOT CLAUDIA,

06:01.926 --> 06:03.450
HE'S GOT OWEN,
AND THE RESTAURANT.

06:03.450 --> 06:06.235
AND US, JULE.
HE'S ALSO GOT US.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.846
WE'RE PART OF
THIS FAMILY, TOO.

06:08.846 --> 06:10.848
YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY SAD?

06:10.848 --> 06:12.850
BESIDES BASICALLY
EVERYTHING, YOU MEAN?

06:12.850 --> 06:14.852
IT'S JUST IT'S SAD
THAT THE TWO OF YOU

06:14.852 --> 06:16.463
HAVEN'T GOTTEN
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.639
BECAUSE
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
A LOT ALIKE.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.205
YOU KNOW,
HE LIKES SPORTS.

06:20.205 --> 06:21.206
YOU LIKE SPORTS.

06:21.206 --> 06:22.643
HE LIKES MUSIC.

06:22.643 --> 06:24.253
YOU LOVE MUSIC.

06:24.253 --> 06:25.950
YOU GUYS HAVE
A LOT IN COMMON.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.256
YOU DO.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.344
Charlie:
THE GUY'S A LOSER.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.868
CHARLIE.

06:30.868 --> 06:33.218
OK, OK, IT'S NOT
THAT HE'S A LOSER.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.655
IT'S JUST--

06:34.655 --> 06:36.439
THAT HE MARRIED
YOUR SISTER?

06:36.439 --> 06:38.485
WELL, YEAH.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.878
I THINK THAT'S
THIS HUGE MISTAKE, SO--

06:40.878 --> 06:42.880
WHY? THEY SEEM LIKE
A CUTE COUPLE.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.491
UH-UH. WE SEEM LIKE
A CUTE COUPLE.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.580
THEY SEEM LIKE A DISASTER
WAITING TO HAPPEN.

06:46.580 --> 06:47.755
DO ME A FAVOR, OK?

06:47.755 --> 06:49.496
WHEN YOU GET
HOME TONIGHT,

06:49.496 --> 06:52.803
SIT DOWN AND WRITE
100,000 GAZILLION
TIMES,

06:52.803 --> 06:54.805
"I WILL LIGHTEN UP.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.067
I WILL..."

07:09.341 --> 07:10.778
CHARLIE?

07:13.171 --> 07:15.173
WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

07:15.173 --> 07:17.785
IT'S NOTHING.
I'M SORRY.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.961
I THOUGHT I JUST SAW
SOMEBODY THAT I KNOW.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.876
I MEAN, KNEW.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.449
CHARLIE,
YOU'RE ALL PALE.

07:36.368 --> 07:38.545
OH.
OH, HEY, UM,

07:38.545 --> 07:40.416
7 NEEDS YOU
TO PUT IN A DIMMER.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.026
I FIGURED
YOU HAD TO REPLACE
THE SWITCH ANYWAY.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.506
IT COSTS MORE, BUT--

07:43.506 --> 07:45.508
YOU KNOW HOW TO PUT
IN A DIMMER, RIGHT?

07:45.508 --> 07:48.206
IF IT MEANS EXTRA MONEY,
I'LL LEARN.

07:48.206 --> 07:49.817
AND HANK CALLED
AND SAID

07:49.817 --> 07:51.209
THAT WE SHOULD
GO AHEAD AND
CLEAN OUT

07:51.209 --> 07:52.863
THAT STORAGE BIN
IN THE BASEMENT.

07:52.863 --> 07:55.736
I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE COULD DO THAT
TOMORROW NIGHT.

07:55.736 --> 07:56.954
OOH.

07:56.954 --> 07:58.303
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:58.303 --> 07:59.957
HOW ABOUT SATURDAY?

07:59.957 --> 08:01.959
'CAUSE TOMORROW'S
NOT GOOD FOR ME.

08:04.701 --> 08:06.050
REALLY.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.312
WHY NOT?

08:07.312 --> 08:09.097
'CAUSE I GOT A--

08:09.097 --> 08:11.360
I GOT THIS THING.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.709
THING?

08:12.709 --> 08:14.929
YEAH. IT'S...

08:14.929 --> 08:16.931
A LANGUAGE LAB...

08:16.931 --> 08:17.932
THING.

08:17.932 --> 08:20.891
ANYWAY, YOU LOOK NICE.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.589
WHERE YOU GOING?

08:22.589 --> 08:26.723
OH, WELL, I'VE GOT
THIS LANGUAGE LAB...

08:26.723 --> 08:27.985
THING.

08:36.733 --> 08:39.562
CHARLIE, ARE YOU NUTS?

08:39.562 --> 08:43.000
WHY? WHY WOULD
YOU ASK ME THAT?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.002
'CAUSE YOU'RE
PUTTING CLEAN DISHES

08:45.002 --> 08:46.569
IN THE DISHWASHER.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.532
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.534
OK, I KNOW YOU, CHARLIE.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.147
SPILL.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.888
ALL RIGHT.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.065
FIRST OF ALL,

09:04.065 --> 09:07.329
THINGS ARE GOING
REALLY GREAT FOR ME,
ALL RIGHT?

09:07.329 --> 09:09.026
I REALLY LIKE NINA.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.855
SHE'S, LIKE,
THIS COMPLETELY
PERFECT WOMAN.

09:11.855 --> 09:12.943
WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT.

09:12.943 --> 09:13.944
AND SHE'S GREAT.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.293
AND WE'RE GREAT.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.991
THINGS ARE GREAT.

09:16.991 --> 09:19.428
ONLY...

09:19.428 --> 09:22.039
TONIGHT,
I'M KISSING NINA,

09:22.039 --> 09:24.041
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

09:24.041 --> 09:25.826
LIKE, OUT OF NOWHERE,

09:25.826 --> 09:27.262
I SAW KIRSTEN.

09:27.262 --> 09:29.003
REALLY? I MEAN,
ARE YOU SURE?

09:29.003 --> 09:30.439
WELL, YEAH.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.441
I MEAN, NO, OF COURSE
I'M NOT SURE.

09:32.441 --> 09:35.096
BECAUSE IT COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN HER.
IT WASN'T HER.

09:35.096 --> 09:37.925
IT WAS JUST SOMEBODY
THAT LOOKED KIND OF LIKE HER.

09:37.925 --> 09:40.101
AND THAT'S
A PROBLEM BECAUSE...

09:40.101 --> 09:42.669
HERE I AM WITH NINA,
AND I'M LOVING THAT.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.106
AND THEN I START
HALLUCINATING.

09:45.106 --> 09:48.457
AND MAYBE THAT MEANS
I'M STILL HUNG UP
ON KIRSTEN.

09:48.457 --> 09:51.721
OR THAT I'M NOT REALLY
READY TO MOVE ON.

09:53.201 --> 09:56.857
WHAT DOES IT SAY
ABOUT NINA

09:56.857 --> 09:59.599
IF I'M SEEING KIRSTEN?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.470
I DON'T KNOW.

10:01.470 --> 10:04.429
BUT NOW YOU'RE
PUTTING DIRTY DISHES

10:04.429 --> 10:06.040
IN THE CABINETS.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.000
AND REMEMBER:

10:10.000 --> 10:12.873
Everyone: IT WORKS
IF YOU WORK IT.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.094
YOU READY?

10:17.094 --> 10:18.748
I GOT TO GO
PICK UP NAT.

10:18.748 --> 10:20.097
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:20.097 --> 10:22.099
I'M GOING TO CATCH
THE MUNI HOME.

10:22.099 --> 10:24.101
MY SPONSOR'S ACTING
LIKE HE MISSES ME.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.277
OK.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.932
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
KISS YOU HERE.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.064
SAVE IT FOR TOMORROW.

10:30.064 --> 10:30.934
OK.

10:37.071 --> 10:39.508
SO, BAILEY,
HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

10:39.508 --> 10:41.510
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE
I'VE SPONSORED
PEOPLE BEFORE,

10:41.510 --> 10:43.120
BUT THEY CALL,
YOU KNOW?

10:43.120 --> 10:45.122
AND YOU,
YOU DON'T CALL
FOR, LIKE, A WEEK.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.950
SO, ME, I WORRY.
AND SO, I CALLED.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.735
JOHN, I APPRECIATE THAT,
MAN.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.520
BUT THE REASON THAT
I HAVEN'T CALLED YOU

10:51.520 --> 10:54.088
IS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
REALLY NEEDED TO.

10:54.088 --> 10:57.047
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
IS REALLY GOING GREAT
FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.309
I'M REALLY DOING GREAT.

10:58.309 --> 10:59.354
SCHOOL, WORK.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.095
TOTALLY MANAGEABLE.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.227
'CAUSE, UH,
YOU'RE COMING UP
ON 6 MONTHS.

11:03.227 --> 11:05.621
AND I REMEMBER HOW
I WAS AT 6 MONTHS.

11:05.621 --> 11:09.581
I HAVE NEVER FELT BETTER
IN MY LIFE, MAN, I SWEAR.

11:09.581 --> 11:12.367
'CAUSE I MET SOMEBODY.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.717
AND SHE'S GREAT.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.632
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

11:16.632 --> 11:18.852
NOW IT'S LIKE
I'VE GOT THIS WHOLE NEW,

11:18.852 --> 11:22.072
REALLY, REALLY GREAT REASON
TO WANT TO STAY SOBER.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.468
WHAT?

11:26.468 --> 11:30.080
LOOK, UH, IT'S NOT
ONE OF THE 12 STEPS,

11:30.080 --> 11:33.214
BUT YOUR FIRST YEAR,
A.A. REALLY DISCOURAGES

11:33.214 --> 11:35.825
GETTING INVOLVED IN
A NEW RELATIONSHIP.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.392
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.917
BAD IDEA?

11:40.917 --> 11:42.527
MORE PEOPLE FALL OUT
FOR RELATIONSHIP ISSUES

11:42.527 --> 11:44.051
THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.444
IT IS, LIKE,
THE SINGLE BIGGEST EXCUSE.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.620
YOU HAVE AN ARGUMENT:
EXCUSE TO DRINK.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.666
SHE CHEATS ON YOU:
YOU HIT THE BOTTLE.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.276
YOU BREAK UP,
FORGET IT.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.148
YOU ARE ON A BENDER.JOHN--

11:54.148 --> 11:55.976
THERE'S TOO MANY
EXCUSES.

11:55.976 --> 12:01.111
HOW MANY REALLY
GREAT RELATIONSHIPS
HAVE YOU BEEN IN?

12:01.111 --> 12:02.765
I MEAN, RELATIONSHIPS

12:02.765 --> 12:04.854
WHERE THERE'S
NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

12:06.638 --> 12:09.685
AND I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING GREAT NOW.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.078
BUT CAN YOU GUARANTEE

12:11.078 --> 12:12.644
NOTHING'S GOING
TO GO WRONG?

12:12.644 --> 12:14.037
WELL, NO, I CAN'T.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.473
BUT...

12:17.432 --> 12:19.434
LOOK, JOHN,
IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE LIKE THAT, OK?

12:19.434 --> 12:21.044
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.654
SHE IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.395
AND YOUR SOBRIETY ISN'T?

12:24.395 --> 12:25.570
YOU DON'T CALL.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.659
AND THEN YOU TELL ME

12:27.659 --> 12:30.097
IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'VE GOT THIS
WOMAN IN YOUR LIFE.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.621
NOW, THAT MEANS
YOU'RE USING HER
INSTEAD OF A.A.

12:32.621 --> 12:35.972
AND YOU STOP
USING THE PROGRAM
FOR WHATEVER REASON,

12:35.972 --> 12:37.844
YOU'RE HEADING
FOR A FALL.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.326
YOU ARE HEADING
FOR A FALL, BAILEY.

13:04.261 --> 13:05.654
KIRSTEN.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.830
CHARLIE.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.092
IT'S REALLY YOU.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.354
OH, WOW.

13:10.354 --> 13:11.703
I DIDN'T--

13:11.703 --> 13:13.096
I MEAN--

13:13.096 --> 13:15.142
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND--

13:15.142 --> 13:17.840
AND I--I COULDN'T NOT
LOOK AT THE HOUSE.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.189
WHAT ARE YOU--

13:20.277 --> 13:21.626
WOW.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.325
YOU--ARE YOU OK?

13:24.325 --> 13:25.979
YOU--YOU LOOK GREAT.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.719
YEAH, I'M GOOD.

13:27.719 --> 13:30.853
AND I'M NOT NUTS.

13:30.853 --> 13:33.682
I THOUGHT
I SAW YOU OUTSIDE
THE ROOSEVELT.

13:33.682 --> 13:36.859
YEAH, UM,
I'M STAYING THERE.

13:36.859 --> 13:40.515
HOW LONG ARE YOU
IN TOWN FOR?

13:40.515 --> 13:42.734
UH, WELL, ACTUALLY,

13:42.734 --> 13:44.258
UM, THAT'S KIND OF--

13:44.258 --> 13:45.999
I'M, UM--

13:45.999 --> 13:49.437
I'M MOVING BACK,
ACTUALLY.

13:49.437 --> 13:52.135
YOU'RE MOVING BACK.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.051
WERE YOU GOING
TO CALL ME?

13:55.051 --> 13:58.054
OK, THE FLAT'S ON POST.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.708
THE LANDLORD'S THERE NOW.

13:59.708 --> 14:02.711
THERE ARE 2 OTHER PEOPLE
INTERESTED, SO IF WE WANT--

14:02.711 --> 14:04.017
OH, OH.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.801
I'M SORRY. HELLO.

14:05.801 --> 14:06.846
HI.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.586
I HATE TO INTERRUPT,

14:08.586 --> 14:09.849
BUT THIS GUY SAYS
HE'S GOT TO LEAVE
IN 15.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.502
SO IF WE WANT
TO GET THERE--

14:11.502 --> 14:14.244
CAN I SEE YOU
FOR DINNER
OR SOMETHING?

14:14.244 --> 14:16.029
'CAUSE
I'D REALLY LIKE
TO TALK, SO...

14:16.029 --> 14:19.641
DID I SAY 15 MINUTES?

14:19.641 --> 14:20.860
YEAH.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.513
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.864
UM, JUST CALL THE HOTEL.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.908
IT'S ROOM 414.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.389
414. OK.

14:37.702 --> 14:40.270
HEY, DIMPLE BOY.HEY.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.706
MMM, THAT'S TIMING.
I NEED A PACK ANIMAL.

14:41.706 --> 14:42.925
SURE.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.100
MY PLANETS
ALIGNED TODAY.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.362
MY BOSS, HE HAD
TO GO OUT OF TOWN,

14:45.362 --> 14:46.886
SO I WAS ABLE TO
SNEAK AWAY EARLY.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.932
YOU ARE IN FOR A TREAT,
YOU KNOW THAT?

14:49.932 --> 14:52.021
UM, ANNIE--YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:52.021 --> 14:53.718
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO HOLD THIS ONE
BY THE BOTTOM.

14:53.718 --> 14:54.937
IT'S GOT CANS.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.896
ANNIE, WE KIND OF--

14:56.896 --> 14:59.942
THERE'S SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.857
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

15:01.857 --> 15:06.166
MY SPONSOR THINKS
THIS IS A BAD IDEA,

15:06.166 --> 15:08.820
US GETTING INVOLVED
LIKE THIS.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.913
BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY
6 MONTHS.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.175
YEAH.

15:15.175 --> 15:19.309
AND THAT KIND OF
HAS TO COME FIRST.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.790
YOU KNOW, MY SOBRIETY.

15:21.790 --> 15:24.967
I SPENT ALL LAST NIGHT
AND ALL DAY TODAY

15:24.967 --> 15:27.274
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WAYS TO MAKE THIS WORK.

15:27.274 --> 15:29.319
AND THEN I REALIZED

15:29.319 --> 15:33.367
THAT THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I USED TO DO
WITH MY DRINKING.

15:33.367 --> 15:36.936
BUT A.A. WORKS.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.894
WE'RE, LIKE,
PROOF OF THAT.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.940
AND IF THIS IS A RULE,
THEN--

15:40.940 --> 15:43.899
THEN THERE HAS TO BE
A GOOD REASON FOR IT.

15:43.899 --> 15:47.468
SO FOR NOW...

15:49.165 --> 15:53.169
CAN WE JUST...
NOT?

15:53.169 --> 15:55.998
CAN WE JUST KEEP THINGS
THE WAY THEY ARE

15:55.998 --> 15:57.913
WITH US BEING FRIENDS?

16:00.002 --> 16:01.830
WELL, I GUESS I--

16:03.353 --> 16:06.008
I GUESS I COULD
FREEZE THE LASAGNA.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.358
AND IT COULD BE
DINNER FOR ME
AND NAT

16:08.358 --> 16:10.012
FOR, LIKE,
A WEEK, SO...

16:10.012 --> 16:11.448
WHAT?

16:11.448 --> 16:16.801
ANNIE, HEY, WE CAN STILL
DO STUFF TOGETHER.

16:16.801 --> 16:20.370
I MEAN, THAT'S PART
OF BEING FRIENDS.

16:20.370 --> 16:21.415
RIGHT?

16:23.939 --> 16:25.288
THIS--THIS IS NOT--

16:25.288 --> 16:27.508
I JUST WANT TO HAVE
DINNER WITH HER,

16:27.508 --> 16:29.118
SO WE CAN TALK.

16:29.118 --> 16:32.295
PLEASE DON'T BE
THREATENED BY THIS.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.905
I DON'T KNOW
HOW NOT TO BE.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.603
I MEAN, FROM
EVERYTHING YOU SAID,

16:35.603 --> 16:36.952
SHE WAS IT.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.867
SHE WAS YOUR ONE,
GREAT, TRUE LOVE.

16:38.867 --> 16:39.868
WHAT?

16:39.868 --> 16:41.435
YOU KNOW THAT THEORY.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.959
THAT WE ALL HAVE ONE,
GREAT, TRUE LOVE.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.656
AND THAT THE REST
ARE EITHER,

16:45.656 --> 16:46.962
I DON'T KNOW,
PRACTICE

16:46.962 --> 16:48.703
OR POOR SUBSTITUTES

16:48.703 --> 16:51.445
OR ALSO RANS.THAT'S NOT--

16:51.445 --> 16:54.100
THAT PART OF OUR
LIVES, IT'S OVER.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.451
OK? ONLY WE REALLY
NEVER GOT A CHANCE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.061
I LEFT HER IN CHICAGO,

16:59.061 --> 17:01.194
AND THAT WAS
THE LAST TIME
WE EVEN SPOKE.

17:01.194 --> 17:03.239
AND I FEEL LIKE
WE NEED TO,

17:03.239 --> 17:06.416
YOU KNOW,
HAVE AN ACTUAL
CONVERSATION.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.984
YOU MEAN,
YOU WANT CLOSURE.

17:08.984 --> 17:11.073
YEAH, I THINK SO.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.988
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING FOR US, NINA.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.424
I'M WITH YOU NOW.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.078
THIS IS JUST SOMETHING

17:16.078 --> 17:18.907
I KIND OF HAVE
TO DEAL WITH.

17:18.907 --> 17:21.083
HEY.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.042
JULIA'S NOT HERE.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.826
ANYWAY,
IT'S JUST TONIGHT.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.654
YEAH, YEAH, I, UH--

17:26.654 --> 17:29.352
I WAS JUST SORT OF
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.877
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:32.877 --> 17:35.054
I SHOULD LEAVE ANYWAY.WAIT A MINUTE.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.447
NO, IT'S FINE, REALLY.
I'M FINE.

17:37.447 --> 17:40.842
JUST CALL ME
WHEN YOU'RE CLOSED

17:40.842 --> 17:42.539
OR WHATEVER.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.849
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

17:47.849 --> 17:50.504
A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON.

17:50.504 --> 17:51.809
WHAT'S UP?

17:52.897 --> 17:54.421
NOTHING. I JUST--

17:54.421 --> 17:55.944
JUST--

17:55.944 --> 17:57.946
HOW ABOUT THOSE
49ers, HUH?

17:57.946 --> 18:00.035
DID YOU CATCH
THE GAME LAST NIGHT?

18:00.035 --> 18:02.037
WHAT?

18:02.037 --> 18:03.604
NO, I WAS HERE.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.388
YEAH, HI.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.695
I NEED TO MAKE
DINNER RESERVATIONS
FOR TONIGHT.

18:07.695 --> 18:10.654
2 AT 7:00
AT A QUIET TABLE.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.482
NO, NO, NOT ROMANTIC,

18:12.482 --> 18:14.223
JUST QUIET.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.007
COULD YOU CHECK?

18:16.007 --> 18:17.226
THIS THING'S
PRETTY COOL.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.227
DOES IT WORK?

18:18.227 --> 18:19.924
NOT FOR, LIKE, 20 YEARS.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.752
THE SALVAGE GUYS ARE
GOING TO HAUL IT OFF.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.319
YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.147
THIS WOULD LOOK
REALLY COOL
IN THE BAR.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.714
I MEAN, WHY DON'T
YOU LET ME FIX IT?

18:26.714 --> 18:28.498
IF YOU WANT.

18:28.498 --> 18:30.631
YEAH, YEAH,
WE CAN DO 7:30.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.067
GREAT.

18:32.067 --> 18:35.026
UH, THE NAME IS SALINGER.

18:35.026 --> 18:37.072
NO, NO, I MEAN,
I JUST--

18:37.072 --> 18:38.508
I MEAN, THANKS.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.510
THIS REALLY
HELPS ME OUT.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.077
IT HELPS ME OUT,
TOO.

18:42.077 --> 18:44.123
I--I MEAN, GRIFFIN.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.776
IT HELPS
GRIFFIN OUT.

18:47.996 --> 18:51.173
SALINGER, CAN I
ASK YOU SOMETHING?

18:51.173 --> 18:53.132
SOMETHING
KIND OF PERSONAL?

18:53.132 --> 18:54.785
PERSONAL?

18:54.785 --> 18:58.224
REED, REED, YOU CAN
ASK ME ANYTHING.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.790
LET'S SAY,
HYPOTHETICALLY,

18:59.790 --> 19:01.227
THERE'S THIS GUY, RIGHT?

19:01.227 --> 19:03.490
AND HE LIKES THIS GIRL.

19:03.490 --> 19:06.188
BUT THE GUY'S FRIENDS
THINK HE'S NUTS FOR
LIKING THIS GIRL.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.538
SHOULD HE STILL
ASK HER OUT?

19:08.538 --> 19:10.192
HYPOTHETICALLY, I MEAN.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.542
HYPOTHETICALLY...

19:12.542 --> 19:14.805
ARE YOU THE GUY?

19:14.805 --> 19:16.764
W-WHAT?

19:16.764 --> 19:18.635
WELL, NO. I MEAN...

19:21.160 --> 19:23.423
OK, YEAH, I'M THE GUY.

19:23.423 --> 19:26.687
WELL, THEN, UH, IT--

19:26.687 --> 19:29.211
IT SORT OF DEPENDS.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.734
I MEAN, UH--

19:30.734 --> 19:33.737
WHY DO YOUR FRIENDS
THINK YOU'RE NUTS?

19:33.737 --> 19:36.044
WELL, YOU KNOW, SHE'S--

19:36.044 --> 19:37.698
SHE'S NOT A SENIOR.

19:37.698 --> 19:39.047
SHE'S YOUNGER THAN ME.

19:39.047 --> 19:40.527
IS THAT STUPID?

19:40.527 --> 19:43.007
I MEAN, LIKE THAT
SHOULD EVEN MATTER.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.096
IF YOU CAN TALK
TO SOMEBODY,

19:45.096 --> 19:48.143
AND YOU FEEL THIS,
YOU KNOW, THIS CONNECTION,

19:48.143 --> 19:50.580
THEN WHO REALLY CARES
ABOUT AGE, RIGHT?

19:50.580 --> 19:52.495
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.497
I MEAN,
WHAT'S A YEAR OR 3?

19:54.497 --> 19:57.065
AGE IS SO NOT IMPORTANT.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.502
SO, YOU THINK
I SHOULD JUST SAY
THE HELL WITH IT

19:59.502 --> 20:01.156
AND ASK HER OUT?

20:01.156 --> 20:03.376
THE HELL WITH IT.
ASK HER OUT.

20:03.376 --> 20:04.377
HUH.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.031
MAYBE I WILL.

20:10.513 --> 20:13.734
Julia: SO,
SHE'S BEEN HERE
ALL AFTERNOON?

20:13.734 --> 20:16.084
Griffin: YEAH.
KIND OF CUTE, HUH?

20:16.084 --> 20:18.129
OR PATHETIC.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.479
AH, SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.132
HE SEEMS PRETTY COOL, TOO.

20:21.132 --> 20:22.525
QUIT OBSESSING.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.440
COME HERE AND
HOLD THIS WIRE FOR ME.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.181
I DON'T KNOW.

20:26.181 --> 20:28.096
IT'S JUST
PRETTY OBVIOUS
WHAT'S GOING ON.

20:28.096 --> 20:29.967
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO SEE HER GET HURT.

20:31.142 --> 20:32.709
OH, DAMN IT.

20:32.709 --> 20:36.147
YOU SURE YOU CAN
FIX THIS THING?

20:36.147 --> 20:38.367
YEAH, OF COURSE
I CAN FIX IT.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.151
YOU WERE WORKING ON IT
WHEN I STOPPED BY FOR
LUNCH.

20:40.151 --> 20:41.849
AND YOU'RE WORKING
ON IT NOW.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.720
I CAN FIX IT, ALL RIGHT?

20:43.720 --> 20:45.374
IT'S NOT LIKE
IT'S THAT CRUCIAL.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.333
IF YOU CAN'T FIX IT,
CHARLIE WILL UNDERSTAND.

20:47.333 --> 20:50.074
I CAN FIX IT, JULIA.

20:50.074 --> 20:51.337
I WANT TO.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.562
YOU, UM, DIDN'T
EAT TOO MUCH.

21:00.955 --> 21:02.522
NOT VERY HUNGRY.

21:35.119 --> 21:36.120
WHAT?

21:36.120 --> 21:37.034
WHAT?

21:46.566 --> 21:48.916
ANYWAY...

21:48.916 --> 21:51.135
WELL...

21:51.135 --> 21:52.746
THAT'S DONE, HUH?

21:52.746 --> 21:54.356
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.315
SO, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.665
YOU WANT TO WATCH
SOME TV?

21:58.665 --> 22:00.144
OR WHATEVER YOU WANT.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.930
YEAH, YEAH.

22:06.412 --> 22:10.198
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:10.198 --> 22:13.244
I DON'T OFTEN GET
A NIGHT ALONE.

22:13.244 --> 22:15.029
WITHOUT NAT, I MEAN.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.857
SO, IF IT'S OK,

22:16.857 --> 22:19.381
I--I THINK
I MIGHT JUST,

22:19.381 --> 22:22.732
WELL, TAKE A BATH
AND EAT A PINT OF
ROCKY ROAD

22:22.732 --> 22:24.299
OR SOMETHING.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.301
SO, YOU MIND?

22:26.301 --> 22:28.608
NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.183
A.A. TOMORROW?

22:39.183 --> 22:41.316
TRUST ME, I'LL BE THERE.

22:41.316 --> 22:43.753
NIGHT.

22:43.753 --> 22:44.624
NIGHT.

22:55.983 --> 22:58.028
SO, UM...

22:58.028 --> 23:00.727
DID YOU FIND
A NEW PLACE?

23:00.727 --> 23:02.816
MM-MMM, NOT YET.

23:02.816 --> 23:05.471
UM, THE FLAT WAS...

23:06.820 --> 23:08.038
DAMP.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.263
HOW'S YOUR SALAD?

23:15.263 --> 23:20.050
UM, WELL, THE ENDIVE

23:20.050 --> 23:23.402
AND THE, UH,
BALSAMIC'S PERFECT.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.491

CHARLIE.

23:28.624 --> 23:29.886
I, UH--

23:29.886 --> 23:31.758
I GOT MARRIED.

23:40.288 --> 23:42.072
EXCUSE ME?

23:42.072 --> 23:44.031
2 MONTHS AGO.

23:44.031 --> 23:46.816
THAT'S WHY
I'M MOVING BACK,
ACTUALLY...

23:48.514 --> 23:49.906
BECAUSE, WELL--

23:49.906 --> 23:51.821
AHEM--

23:51.821 --> 23:52.866
BECAUSE MY...

23:52.866 --> 23:55.129
HUSBAND IS A DOCTOR,

23:55.129 --> 23:57.218
AND, HEH, HE'S, UM,

24:00.656 --> 24:04.094
AND HE'S STILL
IN CHICAGO, BUT, UM,

24:04.094 --> 24:05.313
I CAME OUT EARLY

24:05.313 --> 24:07.794
SO I COULD
FIND US A PLACE,

24:07.794 --> 24:09.926
SO...

24:11.058 --> 24:12.059
OH, GOD.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.452
UM...

24:13.452 --> 24:14.365
I'M MARRIED.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.456
YEAH.

24:22.112 --> 24:24.027
I MEAN, UM...

24:24.027 --> 24:26.029
I WAS RELUCTANT
TO TELL YOU,

24:26.029 --> 24:28.249
BECAUSE--WELL, BECAUSE
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW

24:28.249 --> 24:30.294
WHAT THAT MEANT FOR YOU.

24:30.294 --> 24:33.602
AND IT'S--IT'S
NOT SOME--SOME
CRAZY THING THAT I DID,

24:33.602 --> 24:37.127
'CAUSE I KNOW
THAT I--I MADE SOME
PRETTY WEIRD CHOICES,

24:37.127 --> 24:40.522
YOU KNOW,
RIGHT AFTER YOU AND I
ALMOST GOT MARRIED.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.700

24:53.666 --> 24:56.277
ANYWAY, I--I RAN
INTO HIM LAST YEAR

24:56.277 --> 24:58.061
AFTER YOU WERE
IN CHICAGO,

24:58.061 --> 24:59.933
AND WE...

24:59.933 --> 25:03.502
WELL, ONE THING SORT OF
LED TO ANOTHER, AND...

25:03.502 --> 25:05.373

SO...

25:40.364 --> 25:41.409
HEH.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.892
EVERYTHING
WORKED OUT OK.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.763
LOOKS LIKE.

25:52.072 --> 25:52.942
[DEEP SIGH]

25:56.163 --> 25:58.295
HEH.OK,

MAILING LIST IS DONE.

25:59.993 --> 26:03.300
YOU CAN TELL HIM
HE OWES ME LIKE $100,000.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.650
WHO'S THAT FOR?

26:04.650 --> 26:06.695
DID YOU GET A GIFT

IT'S NOT.

26:19.969 --> 26:21.797

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:23.799 --> 26:25.932
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?COME ON, CLAUD.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.934
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE
A MONSTER CRUSH ON HIM,

26:27.934 --> 26:29.326
AND HE'S 3 YEARS OLDER,

26:29.326 --> 26:30.850
AND IT'S NEVER
GONNA WORK OUT.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.373
WHY PUT YOURSELF
THROUGH THIS?

26:32.373 --> 26:34.984
WHO DIED AND
MADE YOU DEAR ABBY?

26:34.984 --> 26:37.117
I MEAN, LIKE

27:02.490 --> 27:05.014
MAYBE IT'LL LET UP.MAYBE.

27:05.014 --> 27:08.017

MAKE A RUN FOR IT.

27:08.017 --> 27:09.845

27:09.845 --> 27:11.891

27:39.570 --> 27:40.528
HUH.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.926
MAYBE IT'LL BLOW OVER SOON.

27:49.319 --> 27:50.233
MAYBE.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.299
I JUST...

28:12.299 --> 28:14.301

28:16.782 --> 28:17.870
NO. THAT'S NOT IT.

28:17.870 --> 28:19.436
IF I WAS JEALOUS--

28:19.436 --> 28:21.874
I MEAN, I'D HATE MYSELF
IF I WAS JEALOUS.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.310

28:29.011 --> 28:30.447

28:30.447 --> 28:32.449
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IF IT HELPS,

28:32.449 --> 28:34.669

I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT,

28:36.366 --> 28:38.717

SOME MAJOR TRAUMA TOGETHER.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.763
ONLY NOW IT SEEMS
LIKE WHATEVER YOU HAD
MEANS, LIKE, NOTHING,

28:41.763 --> 28:43.983
AND--AND SHE'S
MOVED ON NOW,

28:43.983 --> 28:46.855
AND SHE--SHE'S MARRIED
TO SOME REALLY GREAT
PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGEON,

28:46.855 --> 28:49.336
AND I CAN SEE
HOW THAT WOULD UPSET YOU.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.904
YOU HAD TO THROW IN
PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGEON.

28:51.904 --> 28:53.079
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:53.079 --> 28:55.603

IT'S NOT

40:27.468 --> 40:29.209
NOT ENOUGH,

40:29.209 --> 40:31.690
BUT WE CAN SNEAK
BACK HERE AFTER DINNER.

40:33.692 --> 40:35.258
HEY, CHARLIE.

40:35.258 --> 40:36.172

40:39.306 --> 40:41.134
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

40:54.930 --> 40:57.237
ALL I'M SAYING IS
IF HE DIDN'T WANT ME
HERE BEFORE,

40:57.237 --> 40:59.326
HE SURE AS HELL ISN'T
GONNA WANT ME HERE NOW.

40:59.326 --> 41:01.067
GRIFFIN, HE SAID
ON THE PHONE

41:01.067 --> 41:02.895
TO MAKE SURE
YOU WERE HERE.

41:02.895 --> 41:04.897
WHY, SO HE COULD
POISON ME? UH-OH.

41:04.897 --> 41:05.898
HEY, HEY!

41:05.898 --> 41:07.900
HEY.YOU'RE HERE.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.771

41:32.272 --> 41:35.797

41:35.797 --> 41:38.234

43:04.146 --> 43:05.713
THEY'RE
ALREADY MARRIED.

43:05.713 --> 43:07.062

43:23.078 --> 43:26.473

43:26.473 --> 43:27.474
Waiter: SALINGER.

43:27.474 --> 43:29.563
PARTY OF 7.

43:29.563 --> 43:32.044
THAT SOUNDS
KIND OF WEIRD,

43:32.044 --> 43:34.960
BUT I GUESS
IT MAKES THESE
MENUS RIGHT.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.701

Bailey: YEAH.

43:54.414 --> 43:56.808
WOW, CHARLIE,

43:56.808 --> 43:58.418
ONE OF THOSE
EXPANDING TABLES.

43:58.418 --> 44:01.160
WE HAD TO MAKE ROOM
FOR GRIFFIN, RIGHT?

44:01.160 --> 44:03.205

FOLDS OUT, TOO,

44:03.205 --> 44:05.991

44:07.079 --> 44:07.949
SHOVE OVER.
