<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries...

00:02.635 --> 00:05.742
Seems our dead guy Harvey was
friends with the sirens back in 1790.

00:05.745 --> 00:08.614
Turns out, he was related to
a family from Mystic Falls.

00:08.617 --> 00:09.609
MATT: <i>I got a question for you.</i>

00:09.611 --> 00:11.277
I need you to tell me what this is.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.112
It's a cipher device
used for code-breaking.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.591
When the door between
this world and Cade's

00:15.594 --> 00:16.583
gets cracked open,

00:16.585 --> 00:17.750
it wipes out everything.

00:17.752 --> 00:19.152
SELINE: <i>All you got to do is make sure</i>

00:19.154 --> 00:20.687
<i>that bell rings 12 times.</i>

00:20.689 --> 00:23.957
CADE: <i>The task I gave both
of you was kill 100 people</i>

00:23.959 --> 00:25.225
or kill your brother's girl.

00:25.227 --> 00:26.259
Stefan chose option "B."

00:26.261 --> 00:27.727
Elena's in upstate New York.

00:27.729 --> 00:28.862
<i>That's where Bonnie hid her.</i>

00:28.864 --> 00:29.996
Leave Elena out of this.

00:29.998 --> 00:31.030
Enzo?

00:33.115 --> 00:34.448
[Bonnie screams]

00:34.451 --> 00:36.069
Why do you care what happens to Elena?

00:36.071 --> 00:37.403
You're gonna be dead anyway.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.805
You're gonna be human.

00:38.807 --> 00:40.106

Matt?

01:41.503 --> 01:43.791
How'd you get in here?

01:45.840 --> 01:47.173
Are you okay?

01:47.175 --> 01:49.275
No.

01:49.277 --> 01:51.678

Bonnie!

[crying]

02:19.808 --> 02:22.055
Bonnie, hey, what's wrong?

02:22.058 --> 02:23.958
Is she still alive?

02:26.381 --> 02:27.880
Bonnie, talk to me.

02:27.882 --> 02:29.382
She's okay.

02:29.384 --> 02:31.184
Elena's okay.

02:31.186 --> 02:32.852
Well, those aren't tears of joy, Bon.

02:32.854 --> 02:34.520
What is wrong?

02:35.590 --> 02:37.623
He's gone.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.960
Enzo's gone.

02:40.962 --> 02:43.529
What?

02:45.633 --> 02:47.266
He's dead.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.035
Your brother killed him.

02:52.307 --> 02:53.973
Listen to me, Bonnie.

02:53.975 --> 02:56.075
I am on my way, okay?

02:56.077 --> 02:57.343
No!

02:57.345 --> 02:58.845
Stay away!

02:58.847 --> 03:00.246
Stay away from me.

03:00.248 --> 03:03.549
Not until I know you're safe.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.184
I'll deal with Stefan.

03:07.055 --> 03:08.521
I already did.

03:08.523 --> 03:09.922
What do you mean?

03:09.924 --> 03:12.091
I gave him the cure.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.352
He's human now.

03:21.169 --> 03:24.037
[panting]

03:24.039 --> 03:25.271
No!

03:36.084 --> 03:38.184
[phone ringing]

03:43.992 --> 03:45.625
I'm here.

03:45.627 --> 03:47.894
Stefan, thank God.

03:47.896 --> 03:52.231
I talked to Damon, and I
know what happened to Enzo.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.134
Bonnie... she must be...

03:55.136 --> 03:57.503
I don't even know what to say.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.639
I don't know how I can...

03:59.641 --> 04:02.341
Every time I close my eyes,

04:02.343 --> 04:05.078
I see it play out over
and over again in my head.

04:05.080 --> 04:09.082
And every time I open them, I
see Enzo's blood on my hands.

04:09.084 --> 04:11.317
Just please come home.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.486
I can't do that.

04:13.488 --> 04:14.821
Well, I'm not letting you run.

04:14.823 --> 04:16.755
Okay? So just tell me where you are.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.990
I'm coming to get you.

04:17.992 --> 04:19.425
No.

04:19.427 --> 04:22.261
I can't face you, and
I can't face Bonnie.

[siren wailing]

04:23.965 --> 04:25.932
Damn it.

04:25.934 --> 04:27.300
I'm being pulled over.

04:27.302 --> 04:28.935
Stefan...

04:33.408 --> 04:34.574
[siren stops]

04:44.686 --> 04:46.919
Hands where I can see 'em!

04:46.921 --> 04:48.955
Step out of the car, now!

04:56.364 --> 04:57.964
[handcuffs clicking]

04:57.966 --> 05:00.166
CAROLINE: Stefan?

05:00.168 --> 05:01.801
Stefan!

05:01.803 --> 05:02.768
Stefan?

05:03.805 --> 05:05.771
I didn't even know you were in town.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.541
Yeah, well, Dorian needed
my help with something.

05:08.543 --> 05:11.310
Looks like he wasn't the only one.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.312
So what the hell happened?

05:13.314 --> 05:15.481
I don't know, but I'm telling you,

05:15.483 --> 05:18.284
I could feel the heat from the flames...

05:18.286 --> 05:21.120
hear the screams of all
those people burning.

05:21.122 --> 05:22.753
Are you sure it wasn't just a nightmare?

05:22.756 --> 05:24.654
You know, your mind
trying to work out that

05:24.657 --> 05:27.593
you almost rang the bell
and burned down Mystic Falls?

05:27.595 --> 05:29.562
No, Ric, this was different.

05:29.564 --> 05:31.898
It was like I was actually there.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.566
DORIAN: Maybe you were.

05:33.568 --> 05:36.536
And I don't think this
is just colonial bling.

05:36.538 --> 05:39.305
Based on the time period
and the local coven activity,

05:39.307 --> 05:41.207
I think this could be a witch talisman

05:41.209 --> 05:44.477
that's somehow tied to
the Maxwell bloodline.

05:44.479 --> 05:46.913
Maybe those weren't nightmares.

05:46.915 --> 05:48.981
Maybe they were memories.

05:48.983 --> 05:50.183
How is that even possible?

05:50.185 --> 05:51.317
ALARIC: Well, I've heard of

05:51.319 --> 05:52.418
Latvian witches using
something like that

05:52.420 --> 05:53.795
to contact the dead.

05:53.798 --> 05:55.398
You know, a way to create a psychic link

05:55.400 --> 05:57.156
between the living and their ancestors.

05:57.158 --> 05:58.691
Yeah, and that might
explain how you slept-walked

05:58.693 --> 05:59.725
your way into those tunnels.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.727
Okay, then who am I linked to?

06:01.729 --> 06:03.496
[cell phone rings]

06:03.498 --> 06:06.532
- If I had to guess...
- Hey.

06:06.534 --> 06:09.035
...I'd say the skeleton we
found in the artifact room.

06:09.037 --> 06:11.502
Some of the things you saw, he saw, too.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.339
He wrote about them in his journal.

06:13.341 --> 06:16.049
There are references to working
with a coven of Bennett witches.

06:16.052 --> 06:17.810
- Bennett?
- Yeah.

06:17.812 --> 06:20.713
I wonder if Bonnie would
know something about this.

06:20.715 --> 06:22.548
[phone beeps]

06:23.751 --> 06:25.785
Everything okay?

06:27.055 --> 06:28.754
No.

06:31.226 --> 06:33.759
No, it's...

06:33.761 --> 06:35.895
it's bad.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.773
[cell phone ringing]

06:48.643 --> 06:50.776
[phone beeps]

06:50.778 --> 06:52.411
He hasn't come back.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.579
That's because he's on his way

06:53.581 --> 06:55.932
to Rockland County Police Department.

06:55.935 --> 06:57.450
He's been arrested.

06:57.452 --> 06:58.918
Okay. That's good.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.087
In what world is that good?

07:01.089 --> 07:02.588
One where Stefan's human.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.290
His emotions are back.

07:04.292 --> 07:06.559
The memories of every drop
of blood he's ever spilled

07:06.561 --> 07:09.061
are gonna be doing a
square dance in his head.

07:09.063 --> 07:11.330
It's best he's not alone
with all this right now.

07:11.332 --> 07:13.766
I'll meet you there.

07:13.768 --> 07:15.501
You talk to Bonnie?

07:18.091 --> 07:20.339
I've left so many messages.

07:20.341 --> 07:22.608
She just won't answer her
phone... I don't get it.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.543
Sure you do.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.845
Think about it.

07:25.847 --> 07:29.482
Can you blame her?

07:29.484 --> 07:31.917
I'll call you when I'm close.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.119
[phone beeps]

07:35.690 --> 07:37.690
Forgive me.

07:37.692 --> 07:40.140
I let myself in.

07:40.143 --> 07:43.195
I came to offer my condolences.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.765
I'm sorry for your loss.

07:45.767 --> 07:47.366
I doubt that,

07:47.368 --> 07:49.235
seeing you're the reason Enzo's dead.

07:49.237 --> 07:50.736
I was referring to your brother.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.306
Our deal was for two

07:53.308 --> 07:54.640
immortal souls.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.310
Your friends found a loophole
when they made Stefan human,

07:57.312 --> 07:59.478
rendering our agreement null and void.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.547
You and your brother are now free.

08:01.549 --> 08:04.216
Well, if you're making house calls,

08:04.218 --> 08:06.285
I'm guessing it's not that easy.

08:06.287 --> 08:09.722
While you remain immortal,

08:09.724 --> 08:11.557
Stefan does not.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.959
Which means I'm free to end his life

08:13.961 --> 08:17.363
and recall his soul to
the fiery pits of my world

08:17.365 --> 08:19.198
whenever I choose.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.352
I'm thinking he should die at midnight.

08:21.355 --> 08:23.135
And the fact that
you're waiting tells me

08:23.137 --> 08:24.870
you want something more than Stefan.

08:26.307 --> 08:28.808
In fact, there is.

08:28.811 --> 08:30.809
I've taken an interest

08:30.812 --> 08:32.745
in local history.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.847
There's an 18th-century journal
written by Ethan Maxwell.

08:35.850 --> 08:38.616
I believe your friend, the
occult studies professor,

08:38.619 --> 08:40.119
has come into possession of it.

08:40.121 --> 08:42.488
That what you want? Hmm?

08:42.490 --> 08:44.056
A dusty old book?

08:44.058 --> 08:46.158
It's a small price to
pay for allowing Stefan

08:46.160 --> 08:48.761
to live out the remainder
of his human life,

08:48.763 --> 08:51.664
before he returns to me.

08:51.666 --> 08:53.499
Do we have a deal?

09:05.561 --> 09:07.827
[door buzzes]

09:12.292 --> 09:14.926
So who's Olivia Hayden?

09:19.274 --> 09:21.641
Waitress,

09:21.643 --> 09:24.344
working her way through college.

09:25.457 --> 09:27.948
Till you nearly decapitated her.

09:27.950 --> 09:30.483
How about Javier Ruiz?

09:30.485 --> 09:34.220
Pharmacist. Wife. Kid on the way.

09:36.351 --> 09:38.425
Kelly Parks.

09:38.427 --> 09:40.627
Robert Lansu.

09:41.463 --> 09:42.963
Tanya Handelman.

09:42.965 --> 09:45.225
Jeffrey Li.

09:45.228 --> 09:46.999
The system connected your fingerprints

09:47.002 --> 09:50.003
to 32 murders in the last two months.

09:50.005 --> 09:53.173
You sure you don't have
anything to say about that?

09:55.877 --> 09:58.044
[tea kettle whistling]

10:00.482 --> 10:02.749
ENZO [whispering]: <i>Bonnie.</i>

10:04.446 --> 10:06.286
<i>Bonnie Bennett.</i>

10:06.288 --> 10:08.788
<i>Help me.</i>

10:08.790 --> 10:09.789
<i>Bonnie.</i>

10:09.791 --> 10:10.991
Enzo?

[knock on door]

10:15.197 --> 10:16.663
[whistling stops]

10:22.938 --> 10:24.537
Mom?

10:24.539 --> 10:25.869
[whispers]: Bonnie.

10:30.751 --> 10:33.060
Caroline called me.

10:34.548 --> 10:36.883
She told me what happened.

10:36.885 --> 10:39.953
I'm sorry.

10:39.955 --> 10:42.222
She said you didn't want to talk to her,

10:42.224 --> 10:44.557
and... she's hoping

10:44.559 --> 10:47.494
maybe you'll... talk to me?

11:00.308 --> 11:01.708
[sniffles]

11:06.415 --> 11:07.681
[exhales]

11:07.683 --> 11:09.015
[door buzzes]

11:09.604 --> 11:12.047
My apologies, Mr. Salvatore.

11:17.626 --> 11:20.126
You're free to go.

11:21.197 --> 11:24.664
Thank you. Please notify all
the other agents and officers

11:24.666 --> 11:27.233
this was all a terrible mix-up.

11:44.553 --> 11:46.886
What is all this?

11:46.888 --> 11:48.488
This is me.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.925
No. This is Cade.

11:51.927 --> 11:54.594
He made you do all this.

11:54.596 --> 11:57.063
And he's gonna expect me to continue.

11:57.065 --> 11:59.165
I made a deal.

12:02.537 --> 12:03.837
The deal's off.

12:03.839 --> 12:05.939
What do you mean?

12:05.941 --> 12:10.643
You're human, and
you're of no use to him.

12:10.645 --> 12:13.913
He's giving you until midnight,
and then he wants you dead.

12:15.717 --> 12:17.951
But don't worry.

12:17.953 --> 12:19.686
Damon's on it.

12:24.260 --> 12:25.826
Bonnie's not picking up.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.929
I've tried her five times.

12:30.899 --> 12:32.799
What are you doing here?

12:32.801 --> 12:35.835
I need to borrow a book,
the Maxwell family tell-all.

12:35.837 --> 12:37.937
I'm guessing it's been
out of print for a while.

you show up looking for it.

until you say the words.

37:31.178 --> 37:34.412
Well, regardless of how that goes,

37:34.414 --> 37:37.249
I just wanted to say thank you...

37:37.251 --> 37:39.184
for saving my life.

37:40.621 --> 37:42.354
No, that...

37:42.356 --> 37:45.490
that's no big deal.

37:45.492 --> 37:47.759
I do that 'cause it's Tuesday.

37:47.761 --> 37:50.962
Still, it gave me the chance to...

37:50.964 --> 37:52.798
undo all the damage that I've done.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.166
Yeah.

37:54.168 --> 37:57.302
I've got some undoing of my own to do.

38:00.805 --> 38:04.073
Do you think that
there's a chance for us?

38:06.367 --> 38:08.200
For redemption?

38:14.433 --> 38:16.500
Absolutely.

38:19.827 --> 38:21.359
Get to it.

38:35.275 --> 38:36.408
Hey, Dorian.

38:36.410 --> 38:38.155
So, I'm, uh, so sorry

38:38.158 --> 38:39.444
it got crazy around here today.

38:39.446 --> 38:41.530
What was it you needed my help with?

38:46.486 --> 38:48.954
You know what, it can
wait till tomorrow.

38:48.956 --> 38:52.157
Looks like you have
bigger things to deal with.

39:00.576 --> 39:04.378
Do you have any idea what you've done?

39:04.381 --> 39:06.771
Yeah.

39:06.773 --> 39:09.374
I saved my brother, Ric.

39:09.376 --> 39:10.742
No apologies.

39:10.744 --> 39:13.478
He's human,

39:13.480 --> 39:15.714
and if I'm lucky, I have
about 80 something years

39:15.716 --> 39:16.982
to make peace with the fact

39:16.984 --> 39:18.717
that he's gonna die one day.

39:18.719 --> 39:21.486
All I could do was make
sure that day wasn't today.

39:21.488 --> 39:24.256
Why do you only seem to care
about loss when it's your own?

39:24.258 --> 39:27.893
Because... say it with
me, Ric... I'm selfish.

39:27.895 --> 39:31.029
You have absolutely no idea...

39:31.031 --> 39:33.131
how important that journal was.

39:33.133 --> 39:34.666
I'm gonna take a shot and say

39:34.668 --> 39:37.170
that it was an instruction
manual to kill Cade.

39:37.173 --> 39:40.071
Oh, so you knew? And you
gave it to him anyway.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.908
Yup. Because I know how it ends.

39:44.611 --> 39:46.011
Come on.

39:46.013 --> 39:48.313
Grab your blindfold and your headphones.

40:00.794 --> 40:02.727
[exhales]

40:05.730 --> 40:07.930
[Taser crackles, Stefan grunts]

40:11.772 --> 40:13.405
DAMON: <i>Sybil sure loved</i>

40:13.407 --> 40:15.573
to hear herself talk.

40:15.575 --> 40:17.238
But...

40:17.241 --> 40:20.345
in all that blathering,
she did mention that she had

40:20.347 --> 40:22.447
an insurance policy against Cade.

40:23.949 --> 40:25.754
I'm betting this is it.

40:28.655 --> 40:31.556
Oh, yeah? How sure are you?

40:31.558 --> 40:33.458
60/40.

40:33.460 --> 40:35.126
But a relic of Cade's creation,

40:35.128 --> 40:38.229
that is the means to destroy him?

40:38.231 --> 40:40.665
Now, that has a certain poetry to it.

40:41.401 --> 40:43.435
Ah.

40:43.437 --> 40:45.270
Admit it.

40:45.272 --> 40:47.105
I did pretty good.

40:50.510 --> 40:53.411
Now... [sighs] you got to
have a bottle of bourbon

40:53.413 --> 40:55.080
stashed in here somewhere.

40:55.082 --> 40:57.006
I say we grab that,

40:57.009 --> 40:58.912
exchange a few half-assed apologies

40:58.915 --> 41:02.153
for all the crappy things
we've done to each other...

41:02.155 --> 41:04.789
and make a plan to kill the devil.

41:06.126 --> 41:08.393
Yeah, sorry to interrupt.

41:09.914 --> 41:13.649
But what if I told you
I had a better idea?
