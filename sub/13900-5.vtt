00:04.170 --> 00:04.580
[O'Brien] I know I'd personally

00:05.750 --> 00:06.880
like to have her
back on full duty.

00:06.920 --> 00:07.960
She seems ready.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.670
What do you think, Dr Ronan?

00:09.710 --> 00:12.510
Sergeant Bennett
was buried alive.

00:12.550 --> 00:12.880
She almost died.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.180
I would never think that she
would be recovered by now.

00:16.220 --> 00:19.350
She's experiencing panic
attacks and emotional distress.

00:19.390 --> 00:21.430
But your report says she's
been responding to treatment.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.440
And making signs of
steady progress.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.610
Look, I know you need bodies
on the street.

00:26.650 --> 00:28.190
I just think that Leslie-

00:28.230 --> 00:29.860
You mean to say,
Sergeant Bennett.

00:31.940 --> 00:33.400
She needs more time with me.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.240
There's a chance she's
a risk to herself.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.950
And to the safety of others.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.290
Thank you doctor. This
has been very helpful.

00:40.330 --> 00:40.660
We'll review your notes.

00:41.830 --> 00:43.370
And we'll keep you posted
on her status.

00:44.960 --> 00:45.960
Um.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.380
There is one other thing.

00:47.420 --> 00:47.670
Yes?

00:48.630 --> 00:50.550
There's a man in
Leslie's life.

00:50.590 --> 00:52.210
I think he's a risk to
her recovery.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.430
And who might that be?

00:54.340 --> 00:54.680
[Jake] Oh come on, David.

00:56.300 --> 00:57.930
[David] It's Judge Purcell,
Jake. Or did you forget that?

00:57.970 --> 00:58.930
[Jake] How could I? You keep
reminding me

00:58.970 --> 00:59.930
every thirty seconds.

00:59.970 --> 01:00.270
[Walter] Judge Purcell.

01:01.470 --> 01:02.480
All we're looking for
is an adjournment.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.230
I can't do anything for you.

01:04.270 --> 01:06.980
Me being involved would be
a conflict of interest.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.650
See? I told you, Walter.
This is about Nikki.

01:08.690 --> 01:10.610
So what? You're married to my
ex-wife, okay?

01:10.650 --> 01:12.280
Get over it. I'm sure she has.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.450
Uh, yeah. I'm about to get
appointed to the bench.

01:14.490 --> 01:14.820
And you're going to
jail for life.

01:16.280 --> 01:16.570
I think she's pretty good
with the current situation.

01:18.070 --> 01:21.120
Look. I just need my trial
delayed for a little while.

01:21.160 --> 01:21.490
That's all.

01:22.790 --> 01:23.910
And we're sure we're
gonna find some evidence.

01:23.950 --> 01:24.870
And it's gonna clear Jake.

01:24.910 --> 01:25.210
[David]
Hilarious.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.500
Would you stop being
such a dick, please?

01:27.540 --> 01:28.580
And try and help us?

01:28.630 --> 01:28.920
I don't like you, Jake.

01:30.130 --> 01:30.420
Really? You didn't make
that clear to me.

01:31.380 --> 01:31.630
Did he make it
clear to you?

01:32.760 --> 01:32.960
Because I wasn't
getting that from him.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.680
Does it really look like Jake is
somebody capable

01:35.720 --> 01:37.380
of killing someone?

01:37.430 --> 01:39.090
[David]
No, it doesn't.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.350
But the trial goes ahead as
scheduled in one month.

01:41.390 --> 01:44.180
David, look. Judge Purcell,
whatever.

01:44.220 --> 01:45.930
I know there's footage
out there-

01:45.980 --> 01:48.480
proving Blake Brogan killed
the mayor, not me.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.520
I need some time to
find it, please.

01:50.560 --> 01:50.900
Dead mayors tend to make

01:52.110 --> 01:53.690
the wheels of justice
move faster, Jake.

01:53.730 --> 01:55.400
Bye now.

01:57.490 --> 01:58.820
Hey, Chachi.

01:58.860 --> 02:01.740
Chachi! Get your hands
off the car!

02:01.780 --> 02:04.950
Man, you love this car,
Jake, huh?

02:06.330 --> 02:09.500
I wonder where it'll end up
when you're in jail.

02:09.540 --> 02:09.880
Clyde, what are you
doing here?

02:11.040 --> 02:11.290
We're kinda in the middle
of something.

02:12.380 --> 02:15.300
I had a cool car
too. Remember Jake?

02:15.340 --> 02:16.340
Back in high school.

02:16.380 --> 02:17.930
You borrowed it.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.640
And you killed it.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.010
First of all, it wasn't
a cool car.

02:21.050 --> 02:21.350
Second of all,
I didn't kill it.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.850
You did when you didn't put
any oil in the car.

02:24.890 --> 02:26.850
Cars, they kinda need oil,
Clyde.

02:26.890 --> 02:28.100
It was a bit of a loser move.

02:28.140 --> 02:29.060
[Walter]
Jake -

02:29.100 --> 02:32.650
I am not a loser, Jake.

02:32.690 --> 02:35.230
I got a new job.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.780
And things are going pretty
well for me these days.

02:37.820 --> 02:40.610
You, on the other hand, are
on your way to jail.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.490
A life sentence for murder.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.620
Looks like the balance from
high school has been restored.

02:46.660 --> 02:47.790
You're the loser.

02:47.830 --> 02:49.710
Yes, b'y, I knows now.

02:49.750 --> 02:52.960
Wait a minute, Jake. You gotta
talk to me. That's the rules.

02:53.670 --> 02:54.670
Jake.

02:55.090 --> 02:56.170
Clyde!

02:58.670 --> 02:59.630
Oh!

02:59.680 --> 03:00.550
[thud]

03:02.430 --> 03:03.430
Owww!

03:04.140 --> 03:05.310
Oh my neck.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.020
Aw Jake!

03:08.060 --> 03:09.770
What are you trying to
do to me?

03:09.810 --> 03:11.350
Ahhh!

03:11.400 --> 03:12.310
Am I dead?

03:12.350 --> 03:13.360
What do you mean?

03:13.400 --> 03:13.690
Clyde. It wasn't my fault.

03:14.900 --> 03:15.190
I'm not the one who told you
to jump out

03:16.280 --> 03:17.900
in the middle
of friggin' traffic.

03:17.940 --> 03:20.900
You'll pay for this, Jake.
I swear to God.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.490
I've been trying to
tell you-

03:22.530 --> 03:24.780
Clyde is your new bail
supervisor, you idiot.

03:25.660 --> 03:27.330
[Clyde]
And you and me-

03:27.370 --> 03:29.660
We've got scores to settle.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.400
[Leslie]
Did I have a choice?

04:00.570 --> 04:01.570
That was a joke.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.570
I'm happy to help.

04:03.610 --> 04:03.910
Great.

04:04.950 --> 04:05.240
Because I wanted to
let you know

04:06.620 --> 04:08.200
I'm putting you back on active
cases immediately.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.540
Well, what can I say?
That's great news.

04:10.580 --> 04:11.870
With conditions.

04:11.910 --> 04:12.210
To be honest-

04:13.790 --> 04:15.460
I'll do pretty much anything
to get back to the real work.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.380
I'm kinda losing my mind of
boredom out there.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.210
You coming back has to
be probationary.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.880
Doctor Ronan wants to
continue to see you-

04:21.920 --> 04:24.090
Until he signs off on
this completely.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.760
He hasn't signed off?

04:25.800 --> 04:26.350
No.

04:27.470 --> 04:28.430
My advice is, you
cooperate with him.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.230
Show his that you're ready to
come back to work

04:31.270 --> 04:31.600
and that what happened

04:32.560 --> 04:33.520
to you won't
affect that work.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.480
Which leads me to
my condition.

04:37.940 --> 04:39.860
Stop investigating
Blake Brogan.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.780
I know you went to see
him in prison.

04:41.820 --> 04:43.860
Brogan's the man who
tried to kill me.

04:43.900 --> 04:45.740
And framed Jake for a
murder he didn't commit.

04:45.780 --> 04:47.280
What do you expect me to do?

04:47.320 --> 04:50.040
Don't pursue this case against
Jake Doyle, Les.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.080
That's an order.

04:51.120 --> 04:51.410
Inspector.

04:52.870 --> 04:54.460
I have reason to believe there
was a mole in the RNC.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.290
Is that what this is?
This Starlight Electric-

04:57.330 --> 04:59.040
you had Sergeant
Hood checking into?

04:59.090 --> 05:00.420
Yes. Somebody had
the authorization

05:00.460 --> 05:00.670
to be in our offices.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.420
And was feeding
information to Brogan.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.470
You need to drop it.

05:04.510 --> 05:04.720
What?

05:06.140 --> 05:07.510
It's off your plate. Okay.
Listen to me carefully.

05:07.550 --> 05:09.140
You are not
investigating Blake Brogan

05:09.180 --> 05:11.180
or trying to clear Jake Doyle.

05:11.220 --> 05:13.770
It's really important that
you hear me on this.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.230
Do you?

05:16.400 --> 05:19.110
Of course I do. Yes.

05:24.610 --> 05:24.950
[Benny] So wait.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.660
You ran him over?
Clyde Cowley.

05:27.700 --> 05:27.950
[Christian]
I remember him.

05:29.410 --> 05:31.330
He used to beat you up in high
school all the time, eh?

05:31.370 --> 05:32.580
Clyde never beat me up.

05:32.620 --> 05:33.950
[Benny]
Oh yes he did.

05:34.000 --> 05:34.250
Three times every recess.

05:35.710 --> 05:39.290
They used to have this thing.
A fight on sight clause.

05:39.330 --> 05:41.210
And Jake ran the man over.

05:41.250 --> 05:41.500
Unbelievable!

05:42.710 --> 05:44.880
Boom! His back is shagged.
He's pissed man,

05:44.920 --> 05:45.260
[Christian]
Only Jake-

05:46.550 --> 05:48.220
would get his full time bail
cop hit by a car.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.260
How was I supposed to know
that Clyde Cowley had a new-

05:52.310 --> 05:54.810
You know what? Shag all a ye.
I don't need to explain myself.

05:54.850 --> 05:55.940
Okay. I'm out.

05:55.980 --> 05:56.230
No seriously.

05:57.810 --> 06:00.020
Why were you and Clyde such
bitter enemies in school anyway?

06:00.060 --> 06:02.230
And I remember him shagging
you a bunch of times too.

06:02.270 --> 06:03.320
Shoving you in the locker.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.280
No. Who's bid is it?

06:05.320 --> 06:05.570
I think it's mine.

06:06.650 --> 06:08.610
You're a magnet for
trouble Buttons.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.030
Oh yes, b'y. And you're the
picture of innocence.

06:11.070 --> 06:13.040
I just realized I have no idea
how to play this game.

06:13.080 --> 06:13.370
How many cards you got?

06:14.500 --> 06:14.830
Where'd the hooch come
from, anyways?

06:15.790 --> 06:16.660
[Christian]
Special occasion.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.870
I'm getting married.

06:17.920 --> 06:18.870
Her name is Ruby.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.000
And she's amazing.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.710
Congratulations, man.

06:21.750 --> 06:22.040
Wow Jake.

06:23.050 --> 06:23.250
Must have
been hard living in your

06:24.170 --> 06:25.670
brother's shadow all the time.

06:25.710 --> 06:27.260
That bottle is a mortgage
payment.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.800
Looks like a fine old drink.

06:33.010 --> 06:34.560
It checks out.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.350
Money's good for me. Oh,
speaking of mortgage payments.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.270
That's for you, Dad.

06:41.310 --> 06:42.730
[Benny]
What?

06:42.770 --> 06:44.440
Look at the money
oozing out of buddy.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.740
What do you expect
me to do with this?

06:46.780 --> 06:48.150
You got too much pride
to take it?

06:48.200 --> 06:48.530
[Benny] I got no pride.
I'll take it.

06:49.950 --> 06:50.240
I would like to point out, I
have never been paid.

06:51.660 --> 06:53.580
I've never been paid either.
And I need new slacks.

06:53.620 --> 06:54.410
I needs a new retainer.

06:55.330 --> 06:57.120
Where'd that money come from?

06:57.160 --> 06:59.160
Forget it then.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.290
How's the murder case, Jake?

07:01.330 --> 07:03.460
If Walter doesn't find me some
new evidence soon-

07:03.500 --> 07:03.750
He's screwed.

07:05.210 --> 07:07.550
The only man to clear his name
is rotting away in jail.

07:08.550 --> 07:08.880
I got an idea.

07:10.220 --> 07:11.760
Why don't you just go beat the
truth out of him.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.970
[laughter]

07:14.010 --> 07:15.680
You know what?
Screw all of you.

07:15.720 --> 07:16.640
I'm out.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.560
Come on Jake!

07:17.600 --> 07:17.980
Sit down!

07:19.270 --> 07:20.850
You could run him over with
your car instead.

07:21.940 --> 07:22.900

07:26.730 --> 07:27.070
[Tinny] Sergeant.

07:28.690 --> 07:31.110
Here's a list of our contract
works with Starlight Electrical.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.660
Keep it down, constable.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.620
Ray Bailer.

07:34.660 --> 07:34.910
Should I know that name?

07:36.120 --> 07:38.200
He was working the night
Brogan grabbed me.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.790
Brogan had a mole in the RNC.
I think it was this-

07:39.830 --> 07:41.710
electrician named Ray Bailer.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.040
You think he's the guy that
wiped the computer

07:43.080 --> 07:44.080
after it was put in Evidence?

07:44.130 --> 07:45.590
Possible.

07:45.630 --> 07:45.920
Alright.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.010
So we know that computer
may have had

07:48.050 --> 07:48.260
info on it to clear Jake.

07:49.550 --> 07:52.010
The video footage of Brogan
killing Clarke.

07:52.050 --> 07:54.140
Find anything you can
on Ray Bailer.

07:54.180 --> 07:55.510
And remember, Tinny-

07:55.550 --> 07:58.020
Keep it between us.
I know.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.360
You gotta be kidding me.

08:13.490 --> 08:15.160
I mean, I know I'm gonna
see a lot of you

08:15.200 --> 08:16.120
when you move back in here.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.330
But -

08:18.700 --> 08:20.750
It's nice to see you.

08:20.790 --> 08:23.370
You look terrible.
Are you okay there?

08:23.420 --> 08:26.040
Thank you. Thank
you for your concern.

08:26.080 --> 08:29.800
It's funny. Normally
when fellas go after cops -

08:29.840 --> 08:32.470
They end up as heroes in the
joint. But you-

08:32.510 --> 08:35.010
From what I've heard, have
spent three visits

08:35.050 --> 08:36.600
in the infirmary in the
last eighteen days?

08:36.640 --> 08:39.100
Arts and Crafts got
a bit spirited.

08:39.140 --> 08:41.810
Bit of time in Solitary as
well. Let me guess.

08:41.850 --> 08:44.520
Trying to avoid getting
shivved in the night.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.690
Leslie paid me a visit
recently.

08:46.730 --> 08:49.820
She looks good, I gotta say.
Real air about her.

08:51.530 --> 08:54.700
Guess that happens when you
get buried live, huh, Jake?

08:59.120 --> 09:02.910
Do you wanna hear my
offer or not?

09:02.960 --> 09:05.750
Your offer. Your offer.

09:05.790 --> 09:08.590
How delusional are you? What
could you possibly offer me?

09:08.630 --> 09:10.550
I need the
security camera footage

09:10.590 --> 09:12.210
proving that you killed Clarke.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.470
And I didn't.

09:14.880 --> 09:19.600
[laughing] Well, I did not
expect you to say that.

09:20.890 --> 09:22.350
You know where it is. Tell me.

09:22.390 --> 09:24.520
And I'll get you some
protection.

09:24.560 --> 09:24.810
You know what?

09:26.100 --> 09:27.190
You should worry about
securing your own muscle

09:27.230 --> 09:28.270
for when you get back in here.

09:28.310 --> 09:28.610
'Cause you're gonna need it.

09:30.110 --> 09:30.320
Brogan, you're gonna be in
here until the day you die.

09:31.820 --> 09:33.570
And from the looks of things,
that could be tomorrow.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.240
So. Tick.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.740
Tock, bellhead.

09:40.160 --> 09:43.080
I want out of general
population into segregation.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.920
Give me the information that
I need quickly.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.540
Because my power of persuasion

09:48.580 --> 09:50.750
only works when
I'm on this side of freedom.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.090
Do you understand?

09:54.970 --> 09:56.550
Theo DaCosta.

09:56.590 --> 09:58.050
He worked for me.

09:58.090 --> 10:00.100
He's got what you want
on a hard drive.

10:01.010 --> 10:02.930
If you can track him down, Jake.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.140
Tick tock.

10:10.650 --> 10:13.070
So did you get that intel I
needed on DeCosta?

10:13.110 --> 10:15.110
[Rose] DaCosta worked for
Brogan's construction company.

10:15.150 --> 10:16.110
As a site foreman.

10:16.150 --> 10:17.320
Brogan took your deal?

10:17.360 --> 10:17.660
I dunno. We'll see.

10:18.950 --> 10:20.410
How do we even know DaCosta
has the footage

10:20.450 --> 10:20.740
and Brogan isn't playing us?

10:22.280 --> 10:24.750
Well, we don't. But it's the
only play that we have.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.000
I got an address for DaCosta,

10:26.040 --> 10:27.120
Good. Text it to me.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.710
You want me to come with you?

10:28.750 --> 10:30.630
No, Just keep an eye on
that brother of mine.

10:30.670 --> 10:32.710
He's spending money like he's
got a hole in his hand.

10:32.750 --> 10:33.670
Gotta go.

10:33.710 --> 10:34.670
Bye.

10:35.710 --> 10:36.630
He's right.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.720
About?

10:37.760 --> 10:38.800
Christian's up to something.

10:38.840 --> 10:39.140
Or into something.

10:40.590 --> 10:40.890
Either way, I'm sure we're
gonna get dragged into it.

10:42.430 --> 10:44.140
And by then it will be too
late to do anything about it.

10:44.180 --> 10:44.350
Why don't we poke around?

10:45.640 --> 10:46.890
Just see if there's anything
going on, okay?

10:46.930 --> 10:48.230
We can ease that
handsome mind of yours.

10:48.270 --> 10:48.560
Yes. Let's.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.020
Do you think it's too late
to put the lot of them

10:51.060 --> 10:52.190
up for adoption?

10:52.230 --> 10:54.440
[laughs]

10:55.360 --> 10:57.150
How are you doing?
You okay?

10:57.190 --> 10:59.860
He says, all worried,
all of a sudden.

10:59.900 --> 11:01.610
Now that he knows I'm
controlling his freedom.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.780
I'm confused. I thought
that you and I-

11:03.830 --> 11:05.950
We got past all that
tension between us.

11:05.990 --> 11:06.330
Well you thought-

11:07.410 --> 11:07.750
Almost paralyzing me
would do that.

11:09.370 --> 11:11.080
I didn't almost paralyze you.
You jumped out in the traffic.

11:11.120 --> 11:11.420
That's your own fault.

11:12.420 --> 11:14.340
It's just like old
times, Jake.

11:14.380 --> 11:15.500
I'm back on top.

11:15.550 --> 11:18.470
And you're down there.

11:19.340 --> 11:20.510
Below me.

11:21.090 --> 11:22.720
Underneath me.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.680
That sounds like kind of
a sex thing.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.890
You didn't mean that to
be a sex thing.

11:26.930 --> 11:27.270
It's not a sex thing.

11:28.430 --> 11:29.980
You've broken the
rules of your release.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.100
Most notably consorting
with known felons.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.560
You were just in a prison,
were you not?

11:34.610 --> 11:35.730
I was visiting someone
in prison.

11:35.770 --> 11:37.230
I have power over you again

11:38.820 --> 11:42.950
I can stay awake all day with
the help of my medications.

11:42.990 --> 11:44.570
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I gotta go.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.410
How does it feel Jake?
I wanna know.

11:47.450 --> 11:49.330
I really really do.

11:49.370 --> 11:51.330
How does it feel?

11:51.370 --> 11:52.750
B'y, you're not making any
sense, buddy.

11:52.790 --> 11:54.420
You're just a murder face.

11:54.460 --> 11:56.540
Enjoy your freedom while you
can, buddy, because

11:56.590 --> 11:59.210
I guarantee you - this is my
personal guarantee-

11:59.260 --> 12:01.590
that you won't have
it for long.

12:01.630 --> 12:02.930
Son of a-

12:02.970 --> 12:04.550
Bitch.

12:15.150 --> 12:15.440
So.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.360
They put me back on active
cases today.

12:19.820 --> 12:22.570
Well, that's great news. Is it
great news?

12:22.610 --> 12:24.950
What do you think?
There's a condition, though.

12:24.990 --> 12:26.830
I gotta stay away from anything
that has to do with

12:26.870 --> 12:28.330
Brogan or you.

12:28.370 --> 12:30.450
That's actually good.
That makes sense.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.960
So, officially, that's what
I'll do.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.670
But, unofficially -

12:33.710 --> 12:35.000
No, no, Leslie.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.670
Brogan is my problem
now, not yours.

12:36.710 --> 12:37.040
He tried to kill me, Jake.

12:38.630 --> 12:40.590
I don't care if he's still in
jail. This is far from over.

12:40.630 --> 12:40.840
I just-

12:42.130 --> 12:43.840
I don't want you to put
yourself in a situation-

12:43.880 --> 12:45.390
where you could get
hurt again.

12:52.140 --> 12:53.850
Okay. Well get the hell
out of here.

12:53.890 --> 12:55.600
Because if O'Brien sees me
talking to you-

12:55.650 --> 12:57.310
she'll murder me. Go.

13:03.780 --> 13:04.990
Jake.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.950
In visiting your girlfriend?

13:07.990 --> 13:09.870
No, actually. I-

13:09.910 --> 13:11.540
I just miss
the place.

13:11.580 --> 13:14.040
I missed you, really.
I just missed you.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.540
You realize every time you
go near her-

13:15.580 --> 13:17.210
you just keep dragging
her down further.

13:18.130 --> 13:21.050
Sadly, yes I do.

13:21.090 --> 13:21.420
On the up and up -

13:22.800 --> 13:23.010
I just want to tell you that
if she's seen to be

13:24.420 --> 13:26.220
helping you in any way,
it's gonna be bad for her.

13:26.260 --> 13:30.060
I appreciate that. I mean, the
intel, for you telling me.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.220
So, thanks.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.890
Do her a favor.

13:33.930 --> 13:35.560
Just stay away while you're the
number one suspect

13:35.600 --> 13:36.850
in a murder trial.

13:37.690 --> 13:39.190
You think you can do that?

13:39.230 --> 13:41.650
I'll do my best.

13:41.690 --> 13:44.650
I didn't kill him, by the way.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.030
If you care.

13:52.490 --> 13:53.950
Keep an eye on Leslie.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.790
Let me know if she
goes near Doyle.

13:55.830 --> 13:57.210
Sure thing, Skipper.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.210
Ray Bailer's dead.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.380
Close the door.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.260
- When?
- Last year.

14:08.300 --> 14:10.010
Well he's obviously
not our mole.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.720
Check his union credentials
and employee file.

14:22.020 --> 14:22.320
Well now.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.780
He's in good standing and his
dues are up to date.

14:25.820 --> 14:27.860
Pretty diligent for
a dead guy.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.240
What are you thinking?

14:29.280 --> 14:31.120
Someone's pretending to
be Ray Bailer.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.740
Either to get access
to the Station

14:32.780 --> 14:35.250
or cover their tracks or both.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.210
So this is the resort
we're thinking of.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.540
I mean,
I don't know if I'd marry Des

14:41.580 --> 14:43.920
but a week in Cuba
is a week in Cuba.

14:44.960 --> 14:45.260
What's up?

14:46.380 --> 14:47.970
Constable, I know
what you're up to.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.220
Boss has got her eye on you.

14:50.260 --> 14:51.220
Watch it.

14:51.260 --> 14:51.430
You're spying on me.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.060
No. I'm telling you she
asked me to spy.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.600
Keep your head up.
Both of you.

15:02.520 --> 15:06.650
So this Theo DaCosta? He worked
for Brogan for a long time.

15:06.690 --> 15:08.490
And this is his last known
address right here.

15:08.530 --> 15:09.450
Now.

15:09.490 --> 15:12.200
There is a deadly

15:12.240 --> 15:14.030
pizza spot just around
the corner.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.160
Why don't I hop out, get us a
couple of slices, hey b'y.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.710
Jake we've been sitting here
for ages, b'y. I'm gut founded.

15:19.750 --> 15:20.000
Now if you don't feed me soon,

15:21.290 --> 15:21.500
this is gonna turn into
a hostage situation.

15:22.750 --> 15:23.040
-Do you want that?
-Does he have a record?

15:24.460 --> 15:26.170
No. Theo's clean. No record.
No criminal activity.

15:26.210 --> 15:27.460
But he's Brogan's right
hand man.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.260
Yeah. Like me to you. Except-

15:29.300 --> 15:31.010
I'm left handed and
you hates me.

15:32.180 --> 15:34.050
Looks like his mail's
been piling up.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.310
Oh yeah, right.
The rental agency-

15:36.350 --> 15:40.140
They put up a virtual walk
through of the place.

15:40.180 --> 15:42.060
So it's been empty for
a while. But-

15:42.100 --> 15:45.770
It's hard to tell, actually,
if anyone's been living there.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.070
Unbelievable.

15:47.110 --> 15:47.360
Clyde!

15:48.900 --> 15:51.280
Just go steal some mail or
something. I'll deal with Clyde.

15:54.530 --> 15:56.580
Clyde. I can see you.

15:58.250 --> 15:58.450
Can I help you?

15:59.370 --> 16:00.710
What are you doing here, Jake?

16:00.750 --> 16:03.370
I could ask you the
same question.

16:03.420 --> 16:06.210
Where'd you get that
leather jacket?

16:06.250 --> 16:08.090
I've had this since
high school.

16:08.130 --> 16:09.550
Remember?

16:09.590 --> 16:10.720
No. In high school
I'm pretty sure you had

16:10.760 --> 16:12.630
a suede fringe coat.

16:14.260 --> 16:15.350
Wait a minute.

16:15.390 --> 16:16.640
Are you stalking me, Clyde?

16:16.680 --> 16:17.180
No.

16:18.220 --> 16:20.020
I don't stalk the
people that I -

16:20.060 --> 16:23.690
Stop following me. If you wanna
talk to me, make an appointment.

16:23.730 --> 16:26.020
Set a time and place-

16:26.060 --> 16:26.400
What are you doing?

16:27.650 --> 16:29.690
You owe me Jake. You
owe me a vintage car.

16:29.730 --> 16:31.240
An 'eighty four Dodge Camero.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.280
This may not be it. But it'll
have to do.

16:33.320 --> 16:36.080
You drove a friggin' Chevette.
You didn't have a Camero.

16:44.620 --> 16:45.540
Are you following me?

16:45.580 --> 16:46.750
What?

16:46.790 --> 16:47.840
No. I wasn't
following you.

16:47.880 --> 16:48.170
Why would I follow you?

16:49.380 --> 16:49.710
You're a pretty girl.
But if I followed-

16:50.880 --> 16:52.510
a pretty girl, that'd
be pretty creepy.

16:52.550 --> 16:55.050
Plus, I'm in a very serious
relationship right now.

16:55.090 --> 16:57.430
And I think we might be
together a long time.

16:57.470 --> 16:59.220
- I'm thinking marriage.
- [punch]

16:59.260 --> 17:00.640
Ah! Why would you do that?

17:00.680 --> 17:01.020
Gimme that!

17:01.850 --> 17:02.140
- Just stop that!
- Ow.

17:03.350 --> 17:05.020
- Let go of my keys.
- You can't do this.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.060
Let go of my keys or I
wouldn't have to.

17:07.110 --> 17:08.020
[punch]

17:08.070 --> 17:08.980
Arrgh!

17:09.020 --> 17:09.230
No, no!

17:10.480 --> 17:11.940
You need to respect my new
position, Jake.

17:11.980 --> 17:14.280
And you are a murderer. Ow,
ow, ow, ow!

17:14.320 --> 17:18.490
Oooh! Oh Jake! This hurts.

17:18.530 --> 17:20.410
Jake. Jake!

17:20.450 --> 17:21.830
Jake! This hurts!

17:21.870 --> 17:22.790
No. No.

17:22.830 --> 17:23.790
[punch]

17:23.830 --> 17:25.080
Oh!

17:25.120 --> 17:26.420
Arrgh.

17:29.290 --> 17:29.630
Who are you?

17:30.800 --> 17:32.880
Go dust your face for
my finger prints.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.220
Ah! She hits, Jake!

17:41.890 --> 17:43.350
Good job. You got a
phone bill.

17:43.390 --> 17:44.730
This might be the
concussion talking,

17:44.770 --> 17:47.350
but I think she's a Chevalier.

17:47.770 --> 17:48.810
Arrgh!

17:48.860 --> 17:50.570
Clyde!

17:54.490 --> 17:55.400
Clyde!

18:06.710 --> 18:07.920
Doctor.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.710
What are you doing here?

18:09.750 --> 18:12.920
I was just walking by, and I
saw your car. So, I mean -

18:12.960 --> 18:14.340
I thought it was your car.

18:14.380 --> 18:17.430
Figured I'd stop. Say hi.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.180
I hear your superiors
think you're ready.

18:21.050 --> 18:22.100
I'm back on active duty.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.390
Although I hear you have some
concerns about that.

18:25.430 --> 18:28.850
It's not unusual for me to
recommend a probationary period-

18:28.900 --> 18:29.980
upon your return.

18:30.020 --> 18:31.900
When does this probation end?

18:31.940 --> 18:34.980
I think that you're ready.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.860
It's all up to you
now, Leslie.

18:36.900 --> 18:39.610
How this transition goes.

18:39.660 --> 18:43.080
Am I being analyzed right now
or is this something else?

18:43.120 --> 18:44.160
Meaning?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.370
It's a little odd, isn't it?

18:45.410 --> 18:47.000
Waiting by my car?

18:48.460 --> 18:49.870
I'm not breaking
any professional

18:49.920 --> 18:51.380
code of conduct or anything.

18:52.590 --> 18:53.590
I'm just-

18:53.630 --> 18:55.880
reaching out.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.630
Right. I just feel it may look
a little peculiar.

18:58.670 --> 18:58.840
I think your
destructive behavior

19:00.340 --> 19:02.800
trumps the optics of me
chatting with you on the street.

19:03.680 --> 19:04.680
Pardon me?

19:04.720 --> 19:06.140
Jake Doyle.

19:06.180 --> 19:08.100
You're association with him

19:08.140 --> 19:11.150
is putting
your rehabilitation in jeopardy.

19:11.190 --> 19:15.530
And it's important you know how
strongly I feel about that.

19:22.450 --> 19:27.330
[phone rings]

19:27.370 --> 19:27.620
Yeah.

19:28.710 --> 19:29.000
[Tinny] Serge, I got something.

19:30.540 --> 19:32.250
There's an active cell phone
in Ray Bailer's union file.

19:32.290 --> 19:34.880
And it's pinging from a motel
in British Square.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.380
That could lead me
right to the person

19:36.420 --> 19:38.090
who's pretending
to be Mr. Bailer.

19:38.130 --> 19:39.380
Nice work, Tinny.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.260
[Des] You stole a bail
officer's car?

19:46.310 --> 19:49.180
Can you see how that wouldn't
be good for you?

19:49.220 --> 19:52.350
He stole mine first. And I
need you to find my car, Des.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.900
So please. Just find it.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.440
I will b'y. But I gotta say,

19:55.480 --> 19:57.150
this is a nice
little car, actually.

19:57.190 --> 19:58.990
And it's from this
century, Jake.

19:59.030 --> 20:00.110
What's in the mail?

20:00.150 --> 20:03.240
It's Dacosta's phone bill.

20:05.410 --> 20:07.200
And you know, I can use
this computer -

20:07.240 --> 20:10.080
'Cause cops use this to ping
cell phones, right?

20:10.120 --> 20:13.000
In that case, Clyde, thank you
for switching cars with me.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.630
Oh my God. You know, I gotta
say, that bike woman-

20:15.670 --> 20:17.300
She can really punch.

20:17.340 --> 20:18.710
You okay? Did she hurt you?

20:18.760 --> 20:20.970
Just my pride. And my body.

20:21.010 --> 20:22.550
But other than that.

20:22.590 --> 20:24.680
[Jake] So she's with
the Chevaliers.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.180
You think it's a
coincidence that a

20:26.220 --> 20:27.640
biker shows up
to Dacosta's house.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.520
And is looking for his mail?

20:29.560 --> 20:30.930
I got an address.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.690
We got Dacosta.
Turn here. Turn here!

20:38.020 --> 20:40.150
Theo Dacosta. I think
it's time.

20:40.190 --> 20:40.860
[screaming]

20:42.070 --> 20:44.490
[DaCosta] What are you
doing? Get off me!

20:47.120 --> 20:49.620
Jake I can see his privates. I
can see his private parts.

20:49.660 --> 20:50.790
Des.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.000
Des!

20:53.040 --> 20:53.960
What?

20:54.000 --> 20:55.370
I think you got him.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.920
Can you let the man get
dressed?

20:56.960 --> 20:58.670
Unless you want to leave
him like this.

20:58.710 --> 20:59.500
[Leslie]
Jake?

21:00.710 --> 21:03.090
What's Des doing fighting
with a naked man?

21:04.510 --> 21:06.510
It was a thing we
were doing for charity.

21:09.140 --> 21:09.430
[Mal] I don't know, Rose.

21:10.520 --> 21:10.720
I feel bad about this.
It's wrong.

21:11.890 --> 21:13.230
Does it feel worse than
being lied to?

21:13.270 --> 21:14.690
Well.

21:14.730 --> 21:16.650
I suppose when you
look at it that way.

21:16.690 --> 21:18.610
[Rose] I spoke to
someone at his firm.

21:18.650 --> 21:20.150
I'm genuinely afraid to ask.

21:20.190 --> 21:21.440
It turns out they fired him.

21:21.480 --> 21:22.400
Why?

21:22.440 --> 21:23.940
That I don't know.

21:23.990 --> 21:25.860
So the money is some kind
of severance.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.160
You'd think. Except he was
axed over a year ago.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.080
A year? What's he been
doing up since then?

21:30.120 --> 21:32.120
Who knows, but the way he's
been tossing cash around-

21:32.160 --> 21:33.830
it'd have to be one hell of a
severance

21:33.870 --> 21:35.960
to sustain him this long.

21:36.000 --> 21:36.290
[Mal]
I hope it's not drugs.

21:37.710 --> 21:40.380
For the love of God, please
don't let it be drugs.

21:40.420 --> 21:42.510
I don't think that's his bag
anymore, honey.

21:45.670 --> 21:47.680
So you think that Dacosta's
your mole in the RNC?

21:49.350 --> 21:51.890
That's how they knew where to
grab me the night I gut buried.

21:51.930 --> 21:54.640
He stole the identity of a
dead union electrician named

21:54.680 --> 21:56.350
Ray Bailer to get access.

21:56.390 --> 21:57.480
[Des] Let's get outta here b'ys.

21:57.520 --> 21:58.650
I can't find anything.

21:58.690 --> 22:00.440
Des.

22:00.480 --> 22:03.280
This is gonna hurt, alright.
It's gonna be real quick.

22:03.320 --> 22:03.570
Sorry.

22:05.030 --> 22:08.530
Hi Theo. I'd like you to meet
Sergeant Leslie Bennett.

22:08.570 --> 22:11.410
I know who she is.

22:11.450 --> 22:13.790
Of course you do.

22:13.830 --> 22:17.120
We need the footage of Brogan
killing the mayor.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.210
I told you. I don't work for
Brogan anymore.

22:19.250 --> 22:22.090
I don't care. We need the file
that you took from his laptop-

22:22.130 --> 22:23.340
when it was in Police custody.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.590
We can do this
one of two ways.

22:25.630 --> 22:27.260
Either you give us
the footage.

22:27.300 --> 22:30.600
Or, I shoot you in
the kneecaps.

22:30.640 --> 22:30.890
You just
gonna stand there?

22:31.970 --> 22:32.260
And let her shoot me
in the kneecaps?

22:33.680 --> 22:35.180
You delivered her to the man
who buried her alive.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.770
So I'd say you have it coming.

22:36.810 --> 22:37.770
You're not gonna shoot me.

22:37.810 --> 22:38.100
You're a cop.

22:39.270 --> 22:39.650
You wanna put that
theory to the test?

22:40.730 --> 22:42.360
Give my friend what
he's asking for.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.320
Look, I told you. I don't
know about any video.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.820
[knocking on door]

22:45.860 --> 22:47.950
In here!
[muffled]

22:47.990 --> 22:48.280
You expecting someone?

22:49.490 --> 22:52.160
Yeah. That would be my
Protective Detail.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.240
You idiots are screwed now.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.870
What? What did you say.

22:54.910 --> 22:57.250
My Detail. I'm a
protected witness.

22:57.290 --> 22:58.830
In here! Help me!

22:58.870 --> 23:00.080
[knocking]
Open the door!

23:01.420 --> 23:02.840
[Des] B'ys? I think it's time
to go, alright?

23:02.880 --> 23:03.170
There's a window in
the bathroom.

23:04.550 --> 23:05.880
I'm sorry about all the weird
stuff that we did.

23:05.920 --> 23:06.800
Let's go.

23:06.840 --> 23:09.300
[banging]

23:10.090 --> 23:12.510
DaCosta! Open the door!

23:24.860 --> 23:26.900
Jake!

23:26.940 --> 23:28.320
I'm onto you.

23:32.490 --> 23:34.530
- Clyde! Watch out!
- Get down!

23:34.580 --> 23:36.040
- Arrgh!

23:36.080 --> 23:38.040
[gunshots]

23:38.080 --> 23:39.000
Shots fired.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.500
I'm on the scene. There
are two officers down.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.300
[machine gun fire]

24:03.440 --> 24:04.730
Come on, Buddy.

24:07.230 --> 24:08.440
You're gonna be okay.

24:09.110 --> 24:10.530
DaCosta's gone.

24:12.950 --> 24:15.030
And we're screwed.

24:17.370 --> 24:18.830
[O'Brien] Was I not
crystal clear?

24:19.450 --> 24:19.660
You were clear.

24:20.580 --> 24:20.870
And yet you went ahead and did

24:22.080 --> 24:23.500
the exact opposite of what
I said anyway.

24:23.540 --> 24:25.210
If I had known DaCosta
was being held.

24:25.250 --> 24:26.710
I never would have
burst in there.

24:26.750 --> 24:28.380
It wasn't intentional.

24:28.420 --> 24:30.050
This is a personal case
for you, Leslie.

24:30.090 --> 24:31.920
Everything you do is
intentional.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.220
I told you there was a mole.

24:33.260 --> 24:34.720
I told you I would
take care of it.

24:34.760 --> 24:35.100
Were you going to?

24:36.550 --> 24:38.060
'Cause I felt like I was being
dismissed out of hand

24:38.100 --> 24:38.310
regardless of the facts.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.930
And the fact is, that Ray
Bailer and Theo DaCosta

24:41.980 --> 24:43.060
are one and the same.

24:43.100 --> 24:44.650
It's all tied to Blake Brogan.

24:44.690 --> 24:45.900
And I wasn't wrong.

24:45.940 --> 24:47.480
So was proving you were right-

24:47.520 --> 24:48.940
on a case you'd been
removed from

24:48.980 --> 24:50.900
worth the shooting of
three officers?

24:50.940 --> 24:54.410
Two of them being Feds who
are in critical condition.

24:54.450 --> 24:56.370
Plus one of the key witnesses
is missing.

24:56.410 --> 24:56.740
Am I on defense?

24:57.740 --> 24:58.790
I saved the lives
of those cops.

24:58.830 --> 24:59.160
If I wasn't there -

25:00.450 --> 25:00.660
The point is, you weren't
supposed to be there

25:02.160 --> 25:03.920
in the beginning. So whatever
good you think you did,

25:03.960 --> 25:05.380
is completely irrelevant.

25:08.500 --> 25:08.800
Am I to assume that

25:10.130 --> 25:11.340
what happened at the motel
includes Jake Doyle?

25:11.380 --> 25:11.670
I don't know where Jake is.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.680
And what I did has nothing to
do with him.

25:14.720 --> 25:17.100
Under the circumstances, I find
that very hard to believe.

25:18.010 --> 25:19.010
I did this-

25:19.060 --> 25:21.310
On my own, for me.

25:21.350 --> 25:23.350
That is exactly the
problem, Leslie.

25:24.770 --> 25:28.480
You cannot drag this entire
Station through the mud.

25:28.520 --> 25:30.020
And put a microscope on them-

25:30.070 --> 25:32.030
Just for you.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.410
Listen. Brogan is behind bars-

25:36.450 --> 25:39.990
for a very long time.
And you put him there.

25:40.030 --> 25:41.700
When is that gonna be enough?

25:41.740 --> 25:43.700
When everyone involved
in this is exposed.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.670
Brogan's the one in prison. But
he's not the only player here.

25:46.710 --> 25:47.880
Listen to me.

25:47.920 --> 25:50.630
I am not shagging around here.

25:50.670 --> 25:53.760
You could be facing charges of
tampering with a witness.

25:53.800 --> 25:56.050
And obstruction of justice.

25:56.090 --> 25:56.380
Do you know how long the Feds

25:57.550 --> 25:58.800
have been working
on the Chevaliers' case?

25:59.640 --> 25:59.890
And how long do you think-

26:01.310 --> 26:02.720
it's gonna take Internal
Affairs to come swooping in

26:02.770 --> 26:04.520
to rake my ass over the coals-

26:04.560 --> 26:07.190
Because I've lost control of
one of my officers?

26:09.400 --> 26:11.570
Maybe Dr. Ronan was right.
You need more time.

26:11.610 --> 26:11.940
With all due respect-

26:13.280 --> 26:15.610
I think Dr. Ronan's intentions
are questionable.

26:15.650 --> 26:17.740
You're gonna put him on
your hit list too?

26:19.410 --> 26:21.370
I think it's best for everyone
if you stand down.

26:21.410 --> 26:22.740
Wait. What does that mean?

26:22.790 --> 26:24.580
You're suspended until
further notice.

26:26.210 --> 26:29.210
And before you make this worse
with some indignant response-

26:29.250 --> 26:32.460
You understand that
I gave you a chance.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.340
You screwed it up.

26:35.420 --> 26:36.630
You can leave.

26:48.940 --> 26:49.690
[Jake] Hi there.

26:50.810 --> 26:53.110
Clyde. I woulda
brought you flowers.

26:53.150 --> 26:54.980
But they didn't have
any dead ones.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.690
I'll repay you-

26:56.740 --> 26:58.570
When I visit you at
Her Majesty's.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.870
Which will
be very soon.

27:01.910 --> 27:04.290
Because the second I get out
of here, Jake-

27:04.330 --> 27:06.250
I'm bringing you in.

27:06.290 --> 27:07.710
That is a fact.

27:07.750 --> 27:08.750
That's not gonna happen.

27:08.790 --> 27:09.750
Ahhh!

27:10.460 --> 27:11.750
I'm lying here-

27:11.790 --> 27:14.210
With a friggin'
bullet hole in me, Jake.

27:14.250 --> 27:15.920
Your fault.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.300
My fault?

27:18.340 --> 27:20.590
You're the one who
stole my car-

27:20.630 --> 27:22.010
on a day that the Bikers just

27:22.050 --> 27:23.850
happened to be
keeping tabs on me.

27:23.890 --> 27:24.180
Bikers?

27:25.680 --> 27:25.890
Yeah, they started following
you, thinking you were me.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.350
Likely because you were wearing
this cheap little Randy River-

27:30.400 --> 27:31.730
jacket.

27:31.770 --> 27:33.400
What are you doing?
Get out of it!

27:33.440 --> 27:34.980
I hate to tell ya, Pally.

27:35.020 --> 27:36.980
But you're the one who started
the shoot-out.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.190
Way to go, Wyatt Earp.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.240
Ah, thank you.

27:41.780 --> 27:44.330
My jacket.

27:44.370 --> 27:44.740
Jake!

27:45.580 --> 27:45.870
That's my jacket,
Jake!

27:47.120 --> 27:49.830
There better still be oil in
my car, Clyde.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.460
Oh. Almost forgot.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.090
Here's your keys.

27:55.130 --> 27:57.170
Arrgh!

27:57.210 --> 28:00.590
Sit back. Buddy, relax. You've
had a hard day.

28:00.630 --> 28:02.800
But you might wanna consider
a new line of work.

28:02.840 --> 28:03.970
Owww!

28:08.730 --> 28:09.640
Jake!

28:11.730 --> 28:13.270
Ahhh.

28:16.610 --> 28:16.820
Did you get anything Des?

28:18.480 --> 28:22.490
Aside from flashbacks? 'Cause I
just saw a lot of people shot.

28:22.530 --> 28:22.910
I know honey.

28:24.030 --> 28:25.120
But did DaCosta have
something useful?

28:25.160 --> 28:26.030
No. No hard drive.

28:26.080 --> 28:26.330
Oh great. Now what?

28:27.620 --> 28:30.200
[Mal] So DaCosta had a Federal
detail with him?

28:30.250 --> 28:33.120
Turns out he's a witness in
some big Federal trial.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.290
[Des] The Chevaliers are in the
middle of a huge

28:35.330 --> 28:36.840
organized crime
case right now.

28:36.880 --> 28:37.170
[Rose]
If DaCosta's

28:38.170 --> 28:38.510
testifying
against the bikers-

28:39.840 --> 28:41.420
Why did Brogan send you to him
go get the video?

28:41.470 --> 28:41.800
The only thing I can
think of is that-

28:43.380 --> 28:45.090
he was in bed with the Bikers
long before he went to jail.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.010
Extortion, contract
rigging, all that good stuff.

28:47.050 --> 28:49.260
This is why the Bikers are
laying into Brogan.

28:49.310 --> 28:51.930
They knew DaCosta is a rat and
they're taking it out on Brogan.

28:51.980 --> 28:52.310
Exactly.

28:53.390 --> 28:55.190
So Brogan sends you
after DeCosta-

28:55.230 --> 28:57.150
Hoping that you'll hand over
the location to the Bikers.

28:57.190 --> 28:57.480
[phone rings]

28:58.940 --> 29:00.400
Smart, actually, because then
DaCosta can't testify.

29:00.440 --> 29:02.820
And then Brogan won't be
murdered in return.

29:02.860 --> 29:03.900
Hello?

29:03.950 --> 29:04.200
[Taylor] Doyle, man.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.620
You can't be at
what you're at.

29:06.660 --> 29:08.080
Taylor Gossard.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.580
Please don't tell me that you're
wasting

29:09.620 --> 29:11.330
your one phone call on me.

29:11.370 --> 29:12.910
Look. Just frig off with-

29:12.960 --> 29:15.290
the nonsense you got
going on, okay?

29:15.330 --> 29:16.920
And leave well enough alone.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.590
You're out of your depth.

29:18.630 --> 29:20.420
Now, I'm warning you
as a favor.

29:20.460 --> 29:22.300
That's very kind of you.
Let me guess.

29:22.340 --> 29:26.180
You're the new communications
officer for the Chevaliers now?

29:26.220 --> 29:28.600
You heard me. Back off.

29:28.640 --> 29:28.930
I won't be telling you again.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.600
[Mal] The threats are starting
to roll in now, aren't they?

29:32.640 --> 29:34.850
Sounds like Taylor's playing
with the cool kids.

29:34.890 --> 29:36.480
Do we really think there's a

29:36.520 --> 29:37.770
video of some kind out there?

29:37.810 --> 29:39.110
I don't know.

29:39.150 --> 29:40.570
More bad news for Brogan.

29:40.610 --> 29:42.360
He's running out of options.
Let's go.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.860
-Okay.
-You're not coming with me.

29:43.900 --> 29:44.780
Okay.

29:50.620 --> 29:51.330
[Mal] Where are you coming from?

29:52.370 --> 29:54.460
I just popped down
to Water Street,

29:54.500 --> 29:56.120
Signed Ruby and me up for-

29:56.170 --> 29:57.380
a wedding registry.

30:00.130 --> 30:01.130
What's this?

30:01.170 --> 30:02.460
And son-
I don't mind-

30:02.500 --> 30:03.840
playing dumb,
up to a point.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.470
But come on.

30:05.510 --> 30:05.720
Where'd you get it?

30:06.800 --> 30:08.090
I'm not in trouble
like you think.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.430
It's a partial payment
for a job.

30:11.350 --> 30:11.680
Does the job in question have

30:12.810 --> 30:13.140
anything to do with
money laundering?

30:14.430 --> 30:16.270
Because that qualifies as
trouble. Especially-

30:16.310 --> 30:17.600
if you're being
investigated for it.

30:17.650 --> 30:18.810
Investigated, yeah.

30:18.850 --> 30:20.440
I was never charged.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.820
Some cops asked a few
questions about some-

30:22.860 --> 30:23.150
acquaintances.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.700
You still working for
a law firm?

30:25.740 --> 30:25.950
Yes!

30:26.860 --> 30:29.030
What I did is barely illegal.

30:29.070 --> 30:32.200
I worked at a firm.
I just did things. I used my-

30:32.240 --> 30:32.540
skills for
things.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.450
[Mal] Helping gamblers
and loan sharks move

30:35.500 --> 30:37.290
money from point A to point B.

30:37.330 --> 30:38.250
Clients for your firm.

30:38.290 --> 30:38.630
You're a Bag Man.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.250
You told me years ago you'd
left that behind.

30:41.290 --> 30:42.840
I prefer to think of myself as

30:42.880 --> 30:44.840
legally skilled
financial consultant.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.470
Every law firm's got a

30:46.510 --> 30:47.430
guy like me. I'm good at it,

30:48.680 --> 30:49.930
Does any of this have
anything to do with

30:49.970 --> 30:51.050
the reason you came home?

30:51.100 --> 30:51.390
More to the point,

30:52.470 --> 30:53.350
will any of
this follow you home?

30:53.390 --> 30:53.680
No! I promise you.

30:55.100 --> 30:56.480
In some ways, it's no
different than what you do.

30:56.520 --> 30:57.940
Anyway, I'm out of
that game now.

30:57.980 --> 30:59.980
I am. Look, Dad.

31:00.020 --> 31:04.480
But this is the last time.
For good.

31:05.650 --> 31:07.200
I gotta think about Ruby now.

31:13.280 --> 31:14.990
The Bikers got your
boy DaCosta.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.370
Where's the hard drive?

31:16.410 --> 31:17.710
According to him -

31:17.750 --> 31:19.210
It doesn't
exist.

31:19.250 --> 31:21.170
You were supposed to get me
the drive, Jake.

31:21.210 --> 31:22.540
I need it.

31:22.590 --> 31:24.590
You need it?

31:26.090 --> 31:27.470
I need it.

31:28.590 --> 31:31.840
DaCosta's lying.
There is a hard drive.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.550
He has it. So go and get it.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.850
Why do I get a feeling
that this hard drive

31:35.890 --> 31:37.270
is not gonna help me at all?

31:37.310 --> 31:38.430
What's on it?

31:38.480 --> 31:41.480
And why do you want it so bad?

31:44.190 --> 31:48.360
You find me that drive. And I
will confess. You go free. Okay?

31:48.400 --> 31:50.070
Just hurry up.

31:53.160 --> 31:54.990
It's my life for
your life Jake.

31:55.030 --> 31:58.040
It might be the only shot
either of us have left.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.080
[buzz]

32:06.000 --> 32:06.670
Buttons.

32:08.300 --> 32:11.380
If I get Brogan the hard drive,
he says that he'll confess.

32:11.430 --> 32:11.720
Do you believe that?

32:12.840 --> 32:14.760
No. But I still gotta
find DaCosta.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.760
If the Bikers haven't killed
him already.

32:16.810 --> 32:19.520
Hey Jake, I know you're not
used to the good stuff. But-

32:19.560 --> 32:20.690
Drink?

32:22.270 --> 32:25.110
What's with him and all the
free flowing cash these days?

32:25.150 --> 32:25.900
It's a long story.

32:26.570 --> 32:28.320
You got a visitor.

32:29.650 --> 32:30.950
Hi.

32:31.610 --> 32:32.570
Hi.

32:34.740 --> 32:35.870
You okay?

32:35.910 --> 32:36.950
Suspended.

32:36.990 --> 32:37.910
Oh no.

32:37.950 --> 32:38.200
It's just as well.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.620
Let some of this
craziness blow over.

32:40.660 --> 32:42.750
Leslie, you shouldn't be
here with me.

32:42.790 --> 32:44.000
What if someone sees you?

32:44.040 --> 32:44.460
I don't care.

32:45.420 --> 32:47.420
Just take me up
now. Please.

32:49.710 --> 32:51.420
I knew I'd find you here.

32:53.090 --> 32:55.470
Is that because you're
psychic? Or a stalker?

32:55.510 --> 32:57.260
'Cause my gut tells me
it's the latter.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.770
I see nothing I said has
gotten through to you.

33:00.810 --> 33:02.060
I'm just so disappointed.

33:02.100 --> 33:02.390
I'm sorry to hear that.

33:03.890 --> 33:06.480
I suppose that's something
you'll have to work through.

33:06.520 --> 33:08.150
Leslie, this is all happening

33:08.190 --> 33:11.070
because I am
someone who actually

33:11.110 --> 33:13.200
has your best interest at heart.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.660
[Jake]
Hey.

33:14.700 --> 33:14.990
Doctor Creep Show.

33:16.530 --> 33:18.830
Do you show all of your patients
this kind of special care?

33:18.870 --> 33:19.870
Or-

33:19.910 --> 33:20.410
Jake.

33:21.580 --> 33:21.870
You know, you're the
real problem here.

33:23.460 --> 33:28.630
So maybe it might be a good
idea if you just stayed quiet.

33:28.670 --> 33:30.590
Or. Another suggestion-

33:31.880 --> 33:34.260
I could toss you out over
them stairs outside.

33:34.300 --> 33:37.140
And believe me. They're a lot
more dangerous than they look.

33:37.180 --> 33:37.930
Jake.

33:38.970 --> 33:39.220
You don't know
anything about me.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.020
And you're crossing way too many
lines for my comfort level.

33:43.060 --> 33:45.100
And you need to
cooperate with me.

33:45.140 --> 33:47.690
Otherwise I'm make it abundantly
clear in your status report.

33:47.730 --> 33:50.570
Is any of this worth losing
your job over?

33:50.610 --> 33:51.860
Sergeant?

33:51.900 --> 33:54.280
I could ask you the same
question.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.320
Well, you file a formal
complaint.

33:59.370 --> 34:02.330
If that's how you feel. But-

34:02.370 --> 34:04.460
It'll only serve to
back up the notes I made

34:04.500 --> 34:05.410
in our previous sessions.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.380
So. Fair warning.

34:11.630 --> 34:12.800
You okay?

34:12.840 --> 34:14.840
Upstairs. Now.

34:17.930 --> 34:21.510
Are you sure that you're,
you know, okay?

34:21.560 --> 34:22.680
Yeah.

34:22.720 --> 34:24.560
I'm very okay.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.850
And I'm about forty two seconds,
I'm gonna be a whole lot better.

34:27.890 --> 34:31.690
Well, forty two seconds.
That's a lot of seconds.

34:31.730 --> 34:33.150
I just wanna keep your
expectations low.

34:41.830 --> 34:42.790
[Leslie] Morning.

34:44.120 --> 34:46.000
Get out of bed, you lazy arse.

34:48.170 --> 34:49.330
What are you doing?

34:49.370 --> 34:50.790
Looking for the hard drive.

34:50.830 --> 34:52.210
It has to be
at DeCosta's.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.130
So I opened
up the old-

34:54.170 --> 34:56.260
Real Estates Virtual Tour thing.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.510
I can't stop
looking at it.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.260
It went back on the market
pretty quick

35:01.300 --> 35:03.050
when he went into Witness
Protection.

35:03.100 --> 35:05.100
He needed to get out of
there in a hurry.

35:05.140 --> 35:07.140
And he wouldn't have time to
take everything with him.

35:08.980 --> 35:10.400
Wait.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.360
That lamp's skipping
an outlet.

35:14.360 --> 35:15.610
So it is.

35:16.900 --> 35:19.820
You know,
people have those fake outlets

35:19.860 --> 35:21.620
in their walls to hide stuff in.

35:21.660 --> 35:23.030
It's cheaper than a safe.

35:23.080 --> 35:23.370
DaCosta's an electrician.

35:24.950 --> 35:26.870
It would be nudding for him to
put one of those on a wall.

35:27.620 --> 35:28.830
Should I call this in?

35:28.870 --> 35:29.920
Have someone look into it?

35:29.960 --> 35:30.250
No, no. We need more proof.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.250
If we're wrong, you're likely
to get kicked off the Force.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.630
I got a better idea.

35:51.600 --> 35:52.480
Hey.

35:55.270 --> 35:56.730
Screw you.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.320
Arrgh.

35:59.820 --> 36:01.740
Answer my questions
by nodding.

36:01.780 --> 36:03.240
Is there anyone else in
the house?

36:04.200 --> 36:05.080
Are you sure?

36:06.910 --> 36:07.910
Can you walk?

36:09.790 --> 36:11.460
I'll take him outside.

36:14.290 --> 36:14.590
Turn around.

36:15.670 --> 36:16.920
Put your hands where I
can see em.

36:16.960 --> 36:17.340
Leslie!

36:18.460 --> 36:19.380
Find the hard drive.
I'll get DaCosta.

36:54.500 --> 36:55.630
So close.

36:55.670 --> 36:57.380
What the hell are you doing?

36:57.420 --> 36:58.880
Give me the drive.

36:58.920 --> 36:59.880
Now.

37:05.470 --> 37:07.390
And don't think about
following me.

37:07.430 --> 37:09.970
Because there will be
consequences.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.020
Okay? So just leave me alone!

37:12.060 --> 37:13.770
[gun cocks]

37:13.810 --> 37:14.940
Freeze, you Dirtbag.

37:14.980 --> 37:15.980
[bang]

37:16.020 --> 37:17.150
Ohh!

37:17.190 --> 37:18.110
Clyde!

37:19.070 --> 37:19.940
Ahhhh!

37:21.150 --> 37:22.110
Clyde. You okay?

37:22.150 --> 37:23.070
I'm shot.

37:24.150 --> 37:27.330
Jake, I'm shot.
Twice in two days.

37:28.280 --> 37:28.620
Jake.

37:29.620 --> 37:30.450
You'll be alright, Pally.
Breathe.

37:30.490 --> 37:31.660
Okay, breathe.

37:35.040 --> 37:37.330
I think you were just grazed
across your ear.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.630
I think you're gonna be okay.

37:39.380 --> 37:40.550
He's right there.

37:45.720 --> 37:46.890
I got him.

37:48.510 --> 37:51.470
If you hadn't pushed him,
he would have killed me.

37:53.140 --> 37:57.610
Oh Jake. You saved my life.

38:05.860 --> 38:07.030
How about that?

38:10.990 --> 38:11.290
-[Jake] Des.
-[Des] What?

38:12.620 --> 38:14.500
-What is all this?
-It's financial information.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.290
This proves that Brogan was
working with the Chevaliers

38:16.330 --> 38:18.080
when he had the contract to
renovate the airport.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.880
Brogan and the Bikers-
They were rigging bids.

38:19.920 --> 38:23.050
They were taking kickbacks.
Bringing in contraband.

38:23.090 --> 38:25.050
These files bury
the Chevaliers.

38:25.090 --> 38:25.380
[Des] No wonder DaCosta
hid this so well.

38:26.970 --> 38:29.050
[Jake] It would have be only
evidence he had against them.

38:29.090 --> 38:32.180
Upside, we got all kinds of
evidence against Brogan.

38:32.220 --> 38:34.850
Downside, we got nothing
that clears you.

38:34.890 --> 38:36.270
So what now?

38:36.310 --> 38:38.310
Now it's time for
Brogan to pay up.

39:02.590 --> 39:03.550
No, no, no!

39:04.170 --> 39:05.170
Guard!

39:06.380 --> 39:09.430
[coughing]

39:09.470 --> 39:10.340
Guard!

39:12.390 --> 39:13.310
Tough luck, Jakie.

39:13.350 --> 39:14.520
I'll see you soon.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.690
[gasping for breath]

39:18.730 --> 39:20.060
[laughs]

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
I don't know what I'm
gonna do with you.

39:42.290 --> 39:44.590
I just wanted to get him
put back into custody.

39:45.710 --> 39:47.420
Thanks for lifting my
suspension.

39:47.460 --> 39:49.090
I'm sure getting DaCosta back
counts for something.

39:49.130 --> 39:51.340
But I gotta say,
it wasn't my call.

39:51.930 --> 39:52.850
Who's was it?

39:52.890 --> 39:53.640
Top Brass.

39:54.430 --> 39:54.970
Why would they do that?

39:56.180 --> 39:58.230
Don't get me wrong.
I'm happy they did.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.980
But, you can't expect to do

40:00.020 --> 40:01.230
whatever you want around here.
And not-

40:01.270 --> 40:01.980
face consequences.

40:02.850 --> 40:04.320
What are you talking about?

40:05.270 --> 40:05.520
Between you and me,

40:07.110 --> 40:10.030
I suspect I. A. are the ones who
put you back on active duty.

40:10.070 --> 40:11.820
Why would I. A. request that?

40:11.860 --> 40:12.620
Don't know.

40:13.320 --> 40:13.570
But I will say this.

40:14.950 --> 40:17.290
Brace yourself. Because if
they're sniffing around.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.210
It's not good news.

40:20.750 --> 40:22.210
One more thing.

40:22.250 --> 40:23.750
No more trips to Dr. Ronan.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.050
Training wheels are off.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.140
[Rose] Penny for your thoughts?

40:38.680 --> 40:40.350
Dollar for your body.

40:40.390 --> 40:43.400
I'd say it's only worth about
fifty cents these days.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.650
Brogan was Jake's only
way out of this.

40:48.690 --> 40:48.980
I'm serious, Rose.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.570
I don't know if I can help
him. I really don't.

40:52.610 --> 40:54.570
I can't say for certain-

40:54.610 --> 40:56.120
We're ever going to get to
the bottom of this.

40:56.160 --> 40:56.410
All we can do is try.

40:57.450 --> 40:59.120
I'm just resigning
myself to having

40:59.160 --> 41:01.080
one son who
loves being a criminal.

41:01.120 --> 41:04.210
And the other being
mistaken for one.

41:05.750 --> 41:06.000
[Christian]
Okay.

41:07.130 --> 41:08.500
I want you to
hear a couple of things.

41:08.550 --> 41:11.800
One. I'm done with
the old life.

41:11.840 --> 41:12.050
I sent back the cash.
And that job

41:13.220 --> 41:14.640
I was doing for
that firm- it is done.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.720
I'm over it.

41:15.760 --> 41:16.720
And-

41:16.760 --> 41:17.100
And broke, I take it.

41:18.010 --> 41:19.640
Yeah. I'm
gonna get to that.

41:19.680 --> 41:20.600
And two -

41:22.890 --> 41:23.310
Meet Ruby.

41:24.940 --> 41:27.860
It's so nice to meet you. I've
heard so much about both of you.

41:28.270 --> 41:29.270
Hi.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.400
Lovely to meet you.

41:30.440 --> 41:31.360
This is my-

41:31.400 --> 41:32.400
Hi.

41:32.440 --> 41:32.780
Wife to be.

41:33.820 --> 41:34.410
Which brings me to
number three.

41:35.530 --> 41:37.990
We decided to get married
right away.

41:38.030 --> 41:40.290
A fresh start for all of us.

41:40.330 --> 41:43.660
-[Jake] Wow.
-Hey Buttons.

41:43.710 --> 41:46.540
Come here and meet
a real woman.

41:46.580 --> 41:49.000
Ah, Ruby. This is
my brother Jake.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.380
It's nice to meet you.

41:51.420 --> 41:53.170
I'm looking forward to
getting to know you.

41:53.220 --> 41:53.590
Me too.

41:54.930 --> 41:57.430
So we're gonna get hitched as
soon as possible.

41:57.470 --> 41:59.100
We're ready.

41:59.140 --> 42:00.760
Why waste another minute?

42:00.810 --> 42:03.980
Yeah, it's so great. Really,
right honey? It's great.

42:04.020 --> 42:06.480
[Jake] Well done.
She's gorgeous.

42:07.440 --> 42:08.610
[Clyde]
Jake!

42:12.230 --> 42:13.860
Clyde. What are you doing
here?

42:13.900 --> 42:14.150
All that stuff
you were into.

42:15.570 --> 42:17.740
The Bikers, the whole thing.
Everything we did today.

42:17.780 --> 42:19.320
Oh, like saving your
life. Listen.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.200
Me never seeing you will
be thanks enough.

42:21.240 --> 42:21.580
Sorry.
I can't do that.

42:22.740 --> 42:25.160
I appreciate that you did
that. I do. But-

42:25.200 --> 42:27.920
The bad news is, I
kind of filed the paperwork

42:27.960 --> 42:30.790
to bust you before I
came over there.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.090
Well, unfile it.

42:32.130 --> 42:35.090
Yeah, I can't do that.

42:36.010 --> 42:36.260
So what are you saying, Clyde?

42:37.590 --> 42:38.930
You're planning on sending me
back to prison?

42:38.970 --> 42:39.850
Well-

42:41.220 --> 42:43.430
I managed to come up
with a bit of a compromise.

42:47.600 --> 42:47.900
Jake Doyle.

42:49.020 --> 42:51.770
I am placing you under
house arrest.
