I DON'T KNOW,

01:02.353 --> 01:03.480
WHAT I'M GETTING
FOR MY BIRTHDAY?

01:03.563 --> 01:04.897

- THE PREDICTACATOR, BOB.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.329
IT WAS SITTING RIGHT HERE.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.831
- UH, ALL I SAW
WAS A PINK DONUT,

01:21.915 --> 01:24.000
WHICH, HEH,
TASTED A LITTLE WEIRD.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.168
WAS IT GLUTEN FREE
OR SOMETHING?

01:25.251 --> 01:28.338
- BOB, YOU JUST ATE--
- BREAKFAST FOR DINNER!

01:28.421 --> 01:30.840
[laughs] HEY, YOU PUT A DONUT
IN FRONT OF ME,

01:30.924 --> 01:32.926

01:36.763 --> 01:37.680
DID YOU SEE IT--
DID YOU SEE IT COMING?

01:37.764 --> 01:40.350
- TEN YEARS
OF PAINSTAKING RESEARCH,

01:40.433 --> 01:41.851
AND IT ENDS UP DISSOLVING AWAY
IN BOB'S BELLY.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.187
- YOU'RE TAKING IT WELL.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.773
- BAAAAH!

01:46.856 --> 01:48.149
- KINDA WELL.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.275

01:54.447 --> 01:56.241
COLOR ME DISAPPOINTED, BOB.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.159
I WAS GOING TO MAKE A FORTUNE
OFF THAT THING.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.327
- AWW, LINK.
- WHAT?

01:59.410 --> 02:00.537

02:05.375 --> 02:07.544
- THAT TANK HUGGED YOU
PRETTY HARD.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.878
- "HUGGING" ISN'T THE WORD
I'D USE, BOB.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.005
IT WAS--AAH!
JUST LIKE YOU PREDICTED!

02:11.089 --> 02:13.591
- MAYBE IT WAS JUST
A COINCIDENCE?

02:13.675 --> 02:14.509
- NO WAY.

02:14.592 --> 02:15.718
IT WAS THE REAL
PSYCHIC DEAL.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.762
COME ON, BUDDY.

02:31.651 --> 02:32.902
NO, WAIT!
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.153
OKAY, MAYBE I DO.
NO! DON'T TELL ME!

02:34.237 --> 02:35.405

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

02:57.552 --> 03:01.180
BOB CAN ONLY PREDICT THE FUTURE
FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.226
LIKE--LIKE A BEDAZZLED CUPCAKE

05:52.310 --> 05:55.688
NOT A VIDEO GAME

- YOU SAID YOU LIKED
<i>MAX MAYHEM 8: ULTIMATE MAYHEM.</i>

06:00.068 --> 06:01.110

WITH IT.

06:39.649 --> 06:40.274

06:40.358 --> 06:43.319
OH, ALL-SEEING BOB...

06:43.402 --> 06:46.155
DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU COULD PREDICT
THE TRAPS FOR ME?

06:46.239 --> 06:49.200
- I TOTALLY SEE ME DOING THAT!

06:49.283 --> 06:50.993
- EXCELLENT.
[chuckles]

06:51.077 --> 06:53.663
MAKE WAY FOR KING COVERTON
THE FIRST,

06:53.746 --> 06:55.957
RULER OF THE PLANET EARTH!

06:56.040 --> 06:57.333
WHICH I MAY RENAME
"COVERTOWN."

06:57.416 --> 06:59.377
COVERTON?
- NO, COVERTOWN.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.171

07:06.884 --> 07:10.054
LET'S JUST GET
THIS CORONATION STARTED.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.013
NOW, YOU'LL WARN ME
BEFORE I--

07:11.097 --> 07:13.516
- FREEZE!

07:13.599 --> 07:15.059
- [shuddering]

07:15.143 --> 07:17.603
- "RAY" IS THE NEXT WORD
I WAS GOING TO SAY.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.939
A FREEZE RAY
IS GOING TO HIT YOU.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.692
CURSE MY DRAMATIC...

07:22.775 --> 07:24.652
PAUSES!

07:24.735 --> 07:25.987
- [groaning]

07:26.070 --> 07:28.114
YES.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.533
CURSE THEM.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.535
[grunts]

07:32.618 --> 07:35.872
PERHAPS I WASN'T
CLEAR, BOB.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.999
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
ABOUT THE TRAPS,

07:38.082 --> 07:41.085
ALL THE TRAPS,
<i>BEFORE</i> THEY HAPPEN.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.378
GOT IT?
- GOT IT!

07:42.461 --> 07:45.548
WELL, YOU GOT THE FREEZE RAY--
YOU SAW THAT ONE.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.425
THEN THE FLOOR DROPS OUT.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.218
THEN, IT'S JUST ME,
BUT I WOULD NOT INHALE

07:49.302 --> 07:51.762
THAT BLAST OF KNOCK-OUT GAS.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.098
- AND THAT'S IT?

07:54.182 --> 07:55.641
- PRETTY MUCH.

07:55.725 --> 07:56.225
- EXCELLENT.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.603
LET'S BEGIN.

07:58.686 --> 07:59.896
FREEZE RAY DODGED.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.314
- NOW THE FLOOR DROPS.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.566
- WHAT NEED HAVE I OF A FLOOR
WHEN I HAVE MY HOVER--

08:03.649 --> 08:05.234
[screaming]
- OHH!

08:05.318 --> 08:07.737
FORGOT ABOUT
WHATEVER THAT THING IS.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.406
I SINCERELY MEAN IT
WHEN I SAY "WHOOPS."

08:10.489 --> 08:14.285
- [grunting and panting]

08:14.368 --> 08:15.578
ANYTHING ELSE?

08:15.661 --> 08:17.496
- I WOULDN'T BREATHE
THAT KNOCK-OUT GAS.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.956
- RIGHT!

08:21.792 --> 08:22.919
PPUHH!

08:23.002 --> 08:25.254
- PERSONALLY,
I THINK IT'S MUCH WORSE

08:25.338 --> 08:26.797
THAN
THE PUKE-YOUR-GUTS-OUT GAS.

08:26.881 --> 08:27.298
- PUKE-MY-WHAT?

08:27.381 --> 08:29.300

- UHH! WE'RE CROSSING
THAT BORDER INTO BONKERS...

20:27.601 --> 20:31.355
- ALL OF THIS IS JUST ANOTHER
COMMERCIAL FOR CHICKY Ds.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.814
HEH.
DIDN'T CORPORATE TELL YOU?

20:32.898 --> 20:33.315
[laughs, slurps soda]

20:36.860 --> 20:38.779

21:08.433 --> 21:10.185
CHICK-EE-DEE IS VANQUISHED.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.311
- [slurps]

21:11.395 --> 21:14.022
- UGH. THIS WAS GOOD
RAGMA'THOOTH.
