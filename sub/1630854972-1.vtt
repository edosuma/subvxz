"The President could sense

00:41.850 --> 00:43.310
the arrival
of his Chief of Staff

00:43.510 --> 00:47.050
from the slight breeze
the door makes when opened,

00:47.250 --> 00:49.360
and the President
wished he would knock,

00:49.560 --> 00:51.930
and the Chief of Staff thought,

00:52.130 --> 00:55.100
"I'm not the kind of guy
who knocks and waits,"

00:55.300 --> 00:59.240
and the President thinks,
"I wish he would wait,"

00:59.440 --> 01:01.200

01:17.370 --> 01:18.520
Any comments?

01:18.720 --> 01:20.340
I loved it.

01:21.690 --> 01:23.260
[Hank]
That's one "I loved it."

01:23.460 --> 01:25.380
How about
any constructive criticisms?

01:27.300 --> 01:29.790
Going once, twice...

01:29.990 --> 01:31.050
Moving on.

01:31.250 --> 01:32.390
I mean, you could--
you could say something.

01:34.350 --> 01:36.580
I've given you
my thoughts before.

01:36.780 --> 01:38.750
Just have a glance
at your last story

01:38.950 --> 01:40.320
or the one before that, okay?

01:40.520 --> 01:41.410
Jen, do you want to read?

01:41.610 --> 01:42.800
It might spark some discussion

01:43.000 --> 01:45.010
if you offered something
out loud.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.240
I don't think so.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.230
It could.

01:50.410 --> 01:51.680
[grumbles]

01:51.880 --> 01:54.370
Could you, please,
just for once, say something?

01:55.980 --> 01:58.380
Workshops like this are based
on the idea of peer review.

01:58.580 --> 02:00.210
Guided review.

02:00.410 --> 02:01.600
I'm trying to guide.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.430
Jen?

02:03.630 --> 02:05.910
Professor, I don't mean
to gang up on you,

02:06.110 --> 02:08.480
but you should know,

02:08.680 --> 02:11.000
besides calling our names
to read,

02:11.200 --> 02:13.390
you've barely said anything
in an hour and a half.

02:16.350 --> 02:18.270
Well, I couldn't help
but notice

02:18.470 --> 02:19.800
a wandering point of view

02:20.000 --> 02:22.450
within, basically,
structureless sentences.

02:22.650 --> 02:24.760
No, my point of view
doesn't wander.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.540
Well, it switches mid-sentence

02:27.740 --> 02:29.240
from the President
to the Chief of Staff,

02:29.440 --> 02:30.630
then back, then back--

02:30.830 --> 02:32.500
Yeah, on purpose.

02:32.700 --> 02:34.680
Well, you risk
distancing the reader.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.760
I happen to think
that risk is worth the reward.

02:39.150 --> 02:40.120
What's the reward?

02:40.320 --> 02:41.210
Okay, um...

02:41.410 --> 02:43.120
the reward is I'm--

02:43.320 --> 02:45.430
I'm exposing the flow

02:45.630 --> 02:48.250
of different
collected consciousness.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.350
You know?

02:50.550 --> 02:52.260
I'm calling it
ultra-omniscience.

02:52.460 --> 02:53.740
That's a cool word.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.660
Did anyone else care

02:55.860 --> 02:57.310
that the President
and Chief of Staff

02:57.510 --> 02:59.360
seem to be responding
to each other's thoughts

02:59.560 --> 03:01.790
without speaking,

03:01.990 --> 03:03.320
in a way that isn't...

03:03.520 --> 03:04.670
possible?

03:04.870 --> 03:06.150
I mean,
I'm just gonna say it again,

03:06.350 --> 03:07.580
I loved it,

03:07.780 --> 03:09.320
and you made my shortlist
for the Pulitzer.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.500
You don't get to make
a short list

03:11.700 --> 03:12.720
for someone else's award.

03:12.920 --> 03:13.850
Yeah, look, okay,

03:14.050 --> 03:14.810
responding
to each other's thoughts,

03:15.010 --> 03:16.160
it's not a mistake.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.460
[Hank] It certainly was.

03:17.660 --> 03:19.030
Let's put aside
the multiple points of view

03:19.230 --> 03:20.030
and the wandering tense

03:20.230 --> 03:21.340
and the conversations

03:21.540 --> 03:23.290
that seem to happen
via telepathy.

03:23.490 --> 03:24.430
Even put aside

03:24.630 --> 03:25.640
the Chief of Staff's
necrophilia.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.510
Okay, well,
then there's no story.

03:26.710 --> 03:27.600
Do you know what I mean

03:27.800 --> 03:28.560
when I say
"distance the reader"?

03:28.760 --> 03:29.650
Of course I do,

03:29.850 --> 03:31.300
but that's my choice to make,

03:31.500 --> 03:32.960
as it is every writer's,

03:33.160 --> 03:36.310
as it was, um, Chaucer's choice,
you know,

03:36.510 --> 03:38.610
whose writing I actually find
really distancing.

03:38.810 --> 03:40.050
Yeah, well, less so

03:40.250 --> 03:41.700
because he was writing
in Middle English,

03:41.900 --> 03:44.450
and it's a tricky thing,
comparing yourself to Chaucer.

03:44.650 --> 03:46.800
Yeah, but we don't know
that I'm not the next Chaucer.

03:47.000 --> 03:47.840
We do know.

03:48.040 --> 03:48.800
All due respect,

03:49.000 --> 03:49.930
you would not know.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.700
All due respect,
a cat would know.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.670
Your only novel

03:54.870 --> 03:55.880
isn't even available
at your own campus bookstore.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.290
You-- you're here.

03:59.490 --> 04:00.810
You're here.

04:01.010 --> 04:03.070
The main piece of evidence
is that you are here.

04:03.270 --> 04:04.420
The fact that you're here

04:04.620 --> 04:06.160
means you didn't try very hard
in high school,

04:06.360 --> 04:09.340
or, for whatever reason,
you showed very little promise.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.300
Did that sound harsh?

04:10.500 --> 04:11.860
I'll tell you what.

04:12.060 --> 04:13.130
I'll smile
through the rest of this.

04:13.330 --> 04:14.650
You are here,

04:14.850 --> 04:17.300

at this middling college

04:17.500 --> 04:18.570
in this sad, forgotten town

04:18.770 --> 04:20.180
was some bizarre anomaly,

04:20.380 --> 04:22.310
and you do have
the promise of genius,

04:22.510 --> 04:24.220
which I'll bet a kidney
that you don't,

04:24.420 --> 04:27.310
it will never surface.

04:27.510 --> 04:31.670
I am not a good enough writer
or writing teacher

04:31.870 --> 04:32.710
to bring it out of you.

04:32.910 --> 04:34.890
And how do I know that? How?

04:35.090 --> 04:39.370
Because I, too, am here,

04:39.570 --> 04:41.550

late last night?

06:26.590 --> 06:28.780
I mean,
it isn't really working late

06:28.980 --> 06:30.390
just because it's after
you've gone to sleep.

06:31.780 --> 06:32.960
Yeah, well,
I'm a college professor,

06:33.160 --> 06:35.220

is late.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.850
Why did you buy
so many bananas?

06:55.050 --> 06:56.070
They're going to go bad,
you know.

06:56.270 --> 06:58.290
Just to piss you off.

06:58.490 --> 06:59.680
[phone buzzing]

07:04.510 --> 07:06.390
I think you should just keep up
with the solitary misery,

07:06.590 --> 07:08.470
and, like, don't change a thing.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.260
Who isn't miserable, huh?

07:11.460 --> 07:13.830
Being an adult is 80% misery.

07:14.030 --> 07:15.740
No, I think you're at 80.

07:15.940 --> 07:17.620
The rest of us
hover around 30 to 40.

07:17.810 --> 07:18.700

Nobody is at 30.

Well, then,

I always wanted to be a writer.

09:00.610 --> 09:01.500

09:01.700 --> 09:03.190
I wrote my first novel.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.320
Whenever I get down on myself,
I read it.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.330
It helps me remember
what I'm meant to do.

I'll say anything I want.

11:21.010 --> 11:22.820
I can't be canceled,
I have tenure.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.470
[Gracie] You're an ass.

11:24.670 --> 11:25.650
This is because of you

11:25.850 --> 11:27.390
and your childish outburst
in class.

11:27.590 --> 11:28.340
[Paul] No, no, no, no, no.

11:28.540 --> 11:30.040
It was inspired by him.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.740
It was my idea.

11:31.940 --> 11:33.310
I want recognition.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.570
[speaking in French]
<i>"A partir du moment</i>

11:34.770 --> 11:36.440
<i>ouù l'absurdité est reconnue,</i>

11:36.640 --> 11:37.920
<i>elle devient une passion."</i>

11:38.120 --> 11:39.350
Camus.
It means--

11:39.550 --> 11:40.490
Did you not get my email?

11:40.690 --> 11:42.660
I got a lot of emails
this morning.

11:42.860 --> 11:44.750
I'll bet you did, Peckerhead.

11:44.950 --> 11:46.190
- [Gracie] Read your email.
- [Hank] Why?

11:46.390 --> 11:48.100
Rourke submitted
a new course request

11:48.300 --> 11:50.670
to the school website
for public evaluation--

11:50.870 --> 11:54.070
"The Accidental Wisdom
of Mediocre Regional Writers".

11:54.260 --> 11:55.680
He put me on the syllabus!

11:55.880 --> 11:57.190
Are you not regional?

11:59.450 --> 12:01.640
Your choice to insult us all,

12:01.840 --> 12:03.990
especially in an open forum,

12:04.190 --> 12:05.420
it's simply incorrect.

12:05.620 --> 12:07.210
We have no shortage
of worthy scholars

12:07.410 --> 12:08.250
and published authors.

12:08.450 --> 12:09.250
[Hank] Name one.

12:09.450 --> 12:10.210
I'll name two--

12:10.410 --> 12:12.300
myself...

12:12.500 --> 12:13.290
and perhaps Billie.

12:14.950 --> 12:16.350
My book of sonnets
on Jonathan Swift

12:16.550 --> 12:18.700
has become the benchmark

12:18.900 --> 12:21.180
in early-feminist,
18th-century response poetry.

12:21.380 --> 12:23.270
You are deliberately trying

12:23.470 --> 12:24.840
to invalidate
the last decade of my career.

12:25.030 --> 12:25.970
[Paul] Decade?

12:26.170 --> 12:28.530
That book came out
25 years ago,

12:28.730 --> 12:30.060
and I remember it distinctly,

12:30.260 --> 12:32.190
because the first email
I ever got

12:32.390 --> 12:34.500
was a bill mistakenly sent
from your self-publisher.

12:34.700 --> 12:37.060
Nobody was brave enough
to publish that book.

12:37.260 --> 12:38.410
It was ahead of its time.

12:38.610 --> 12:39.550
Maybe you should have waited.

12:39.740 --> 12:40.720
- You--
- Ow!

12:40.920 --> 12:42.900
Oh, shit! Shit.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.410
Let go of the notebook.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.510
But it has original work in it.

12:47.710 --> 12:49.030
Not if it's yours.

12:49.230 --> 12:49.900
- You--
- Ow!

12:50.100 --> 12:50.980
Oh!

12:52.160 --> 12:53.340
- Ew!
- [Gracie] Oh, god, I'm sorry.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.600
I...

12:54.800 --> 12:57.260
I-I...

12:57.460 --> 12:58.740
I-I didn't--
I didn't mean to.

12:58.940 --> 12:59.780
I... Are you...?

12:59.980 --> 13:01.310
Going to sue?

13:01.510 --> 13:04.310
Yes! I want every penny
from the sale of those poems.

13:04.510 --> 13:07.270
You can put all of them
in this tiny pocket.

13:07.470 --> 13:09.660
[ <i>"Yulelé"</i>
by Eduardo Mateo playing]

13:09.860 --> 13:12.400
Jill from Jacob Rose's office
called again?

13:12.600 --> 13:14.010
Dean Rose would like
to see you right away?

13:14.210 --> 13:15.710
Tell them I have a class.

13:15.910 --> 13:17.240
I said that?

13:17.430 --> 13:18.890
She said right after class?

13:19.090 --> 13:20.800
Oh. Then I have another class.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.680
Then I said that?

13:22.880 --> 13:24.160
Then she said

13:24.350 --> 13:26.100
that it better not be
racquetball with Tony?

13:27.450 --> 13:28.680
And then I said,

13:28.880 --> 13:30.070
"Have you ever been asked
to cover for your boss

13:30.270 --> 13:31.290
when he was doing something

13:31.490 --> 13:33.120
he didn't want
people to know about?"

13:33.320 --> 13:34.770
Then she got real quiet.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.210
Hey, Daniel.

13:40.410 --> 13:42.780
I hope you brought
enough vape pens for everyone.

13:42.980 --> 13:43.830
[rapid footsteps approaching]

13:44.030 --> 13:45.520
Did you just run?

13:45.720 --> 13:46.830
[exhales]

13:47.030 --> 13:48.440
Are you ready to handle
this Calvin situation?

13:48.640 --> 13:51.430
You shouldn't be so excited
about expelling a kid.

13:54.180 --> 13:56.320
He disrupts my class,
he throws things--

13:56.520 --> 13:57.880
Don't talk about
how disruptive my son is

13:58.080 --> 13:59.800
when it's your job
to control your class.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.450
No. It's my job to teach,

14:02.650 --> 14:04.060
and I can't do my job

14:04.260 --> 14:06.070
if I'm spending 80% of my energy
trying to control her kid--

14:06.270 --> 14:08.420
Do you know that most chocolate
has vegetable oil in it?

14:08.620 --> 14:09.410
Or even animal fat?

14:10.410 --> 14:11.940
Lily, please.

14:12.140 --> 14:12.940
Look, we're here
to talk about Calvin

14:13.140 --> 14:14.120
and what to do

14:14.320 --> 14:14.950
at this important juncture
in his life,

14:15.140 --> 14:16.770
but first, just hear me out.

14:16.970 --> 14:19.560
France regulates chocolate.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.170
They don't allow anything
but pure cocoa liquor,

14:22.370 --> 14:24.820
which is what gives chocolate
its rich, delicious flavor.

14:25.020 --> 14:26.740
France, by law,

14:26.940 --> 14:29.350
says that there must be
at least 40%,

14:29.550 --> 14:30.570
but that's not nearly
good enough

14:30.770 --> 14:32.000
for La Maison du Chocolat.

14:33.220 --> 14:36.140
This was flown in
from France last week,

14:36.340 --> 14:37.520
and I'd like to share
some of it with you.

14:44.180 --> 14:45.450
Before you eat it,

14:45.650 --> 14:47.530
I want you to, um,
feel it in your hand.

14:48.970 --> 14:50.360
Just, like,
feel the weight of it.

14:51.540 --> 14:53.110
And then,
place it on your tongue,

14:53.310 --> 14:54.280
and keep it there.

14:56.890 --> 14:57.890
Let it melt in your mouth.

14:58.980 --> 15:01.030
It's amazing, right?

15:01.230 --> 15:02.510
Michelle,
you're an excellent teacher.

15:02.710 --> 15:04.380
And you are clearly
a loving and caring mother.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.170
Look, you want Calvin
expelled from school,

15:07.370 --> 15:09.300
that's not feasible,

15:09.500 --> 15:11.690
but he doesn't have to take
biology this year.

15:12.910 --> 15:13.690
He could make it up
in summer school.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.750
I feel a little manipulated
by this delicious chocolate.

15:17.950 --> 15:18.910
Yeah, I feel the same.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.220
There's common ground.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.240
I liked what you said.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.500
This place sucks.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.140
It should be shut down.

15:38.580 --> 15:39.770
Hey, Jill.

15:39.970 --> 15:41.250
He said he'd like you
to read this,

15:41.450 --> 15:42.500
and then go right in.

15:45.980 --> 15:47.210
Polite note.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.780
May I keep this
for my collection of memorabilia

15:49.980 --> 15:52.130
of times when people
were being polite to me,

15:52.330 --> 15:54.090
only to be setting
a trap of some sort?

15:54.290 --> 15:55.920
I don't think it matters.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.350
Well, nothing matters.

15:57.550 --> 15:58.960
That can't be our standard.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.180
It tells me a lot
that you drove all this way.

16:01.380 --> 16:02.400
I appreciate that.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.400
You take it seriously.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.840
Because, guess what?

16:05.040 --> 16:06.060
I take it seriously,
and we should take it seriously.

16:06.260 --> 16:08.320
Are we upset?
You betcha.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.280
But what you have to understand

16:09.480 --> 16:11.670
is that Hank is going through

16:11.870 --> 16:14.720
a rough patch
with his diverticulitis.

16:14.920 --> 16:18.200
Infected and inflamed pouches
bulging from his colon.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.070
Complete bowel Armageddon.

16:21.270 --> 16:23.550
Is it an excuse?
No, of course not.

16:23.750 --> 16:24.940
Of course it isn't.

16:25.140 --> 16:27.120
He may not take that out
on your son,

16:27.320 --> 16:29.250
and everyone agrees with that,

16:29.450 --> 16:30.380
especially Hank.

16:32.810 --> 16:34.600
So we're on the same page.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.610
Bowel Armageddon?
Really?

16:37.810 --> 16:39.700
Hank, this article,
this is bad.

16:39.900 --> 16:41.470
I'm sure
they twisted my words.

16:43.350 --> 16:44.400
Oh.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.480
No, that's
pretty much verbatim.

16:48.570 --> 16:50.270
Well, they were
ganging up on me.

16:50.470 --> 16:51.360
They don't mention that.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.280
Every phone call
I've had today?

16:53.480 --> 16:55.500
Board members demanding that
I kick your butt off campus.

16:55.700 --> 16:56.760
Maybe you explain to them

16:56.960 --> 16:58.630
just how powerless
your position really is?

16:58.830 --> 16:59.670
I think they'll understand.

16:59.870 --> 17:00.980
I wish I could.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.110
It would make my life
a whole lot easier.

17:02.310 --> 17:04.240
Well, I think
it's a good thing.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.680
I put it out there.

17:05.880 --> 17:07.730
Maybe Railton
can become a beacon,

17:07.930 --> 17:10.820
a refuge now for
really, really lazy students.

17:11.020 --> 17:13.690
Just apologize
to the kid and his parents,

17:13.890 --> 17:15.170
make this go away.
I don't need this today.

17:15.370 --> 17:16.780
No, I am not apologizing.

17:16.980 --> 17:19.350
I mean, unless you name
a building after me--

17:19.550 --> 17:20.830
and not a dorm.

17:21.030 --> 17:23.570
I don't want any of these idiots
sleeping in my building.

17:23.770 --> 17:24.660
[Jill] Jacob?

17:24.860 --> 17:26.140
The President's on.

17:26.340 --> 17:27.660
You tell him I'm not sorry.

17:27.860 --> 17:29.010
Hank!

17:29.210 --> 17:30.710
This is not about
you and your little situation.

17:30.910 --> 17:32.660
I'll take it
in the conference room.

17:32.860 --> 17:33.840
Please tell
the William-Stevenses

17:34.040 --> 17:35.050
that I'll be back momentarily.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.370
Did Gracie really deserve
all that teasing?

17:43.570 --> 17:44.760
[Hank] "Deserve".

17:44.960 --> 17:47.200
You don't still believe
in "deserve", do you?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.720
It's an unfair world,

17:48.920 --> 17:50.850
I'm not going to even things up
with a few kind acts.

17:52.940 --> 17:55.300
You know...

17:55.500 --> 17:56.380
tenure doesn't mean

17:56.580 --> 17:57.690
you can't get smacked
in the face.

17:57.890 --> 18:00.520
No, it just means
I can never, ever be fired.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.040
It doesn't mean that, either.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.560
It kinda feels like it.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.180
So you're trying to get fired
with no hope of success?

18:07.380 --> 18:08.530
You think I'm trying
to get fired?

18:08.730 --> 18:11.090
Did you apologize to the kid?

18:11.290 --> 18:12.560
For what?

18:14.610 --> 18:15.750
You don't think
this has anything to do

18:15.950 --> 18:16.880
with that article

18:17.080 --> 18:18.060
you're pretending
not to carry around?

18:18.260 --> 18:19.580
I'm not carrying
anything around.

18:19.780 --> 18:20.710
No?

18:20.910 --> 18:21.800
So if I just--

18:22.000 --> 18:23.280
No, no!

18:23.480 --> 18:24.630
It might be there.

18:24.830 --> 18:25.930
I don't know.

18:27.970 --> 18:28.890
My father retires.

18:30.190 --> 18:31.160
It's a major thing.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.330
Big enough

18:32.530 --> 18:33.590
for the biggest newspaper
in the country

18:33.790 --> 18:35.070
to put it on the cover
of the arts section.

18:35.270 --> 18:36.240
Good for him.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.250
Also, I find out about it

18:39.450 --> 18:41.560
from the cover
of the arts section.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.870
Good for me.

18:44.070 --> 18:45.390
And this makes you feel...?

18:45.590 --> 18:46.420
Nothing.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.570
And that outburst in class?

18:48.770 --> 18:50.170
Was unrelated.

18:51.390 --> 18:52.480
In fact, it felt good.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.490
I told the truth.

18:54.680 --> 18:55.620
I think I inspired myself.

18:55.820 --> 18:57.750
To tell the truth more?

18:57.950 --> 18:58.780
That's not good.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.490
To work on my novel.

19:01.690 --> 19:04.060
Oh, great!

19:04.260 --> 19:06.020
Well, I love it when you start
your second novel.

19:06.220 --> 19:09.230
It's usually a wonderful time
in our marriage.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.280
How was your day?

19:15.370 --> 19:16.810
[Lily] Julie's coming over.

19:17.010 --> 19:18.420
I don't know why.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.290
[ <i>"Jumping Strings"</i>
by Paolo Andriotti playing]

19:20.490 --> 19:21.640
[Hank, thinking] <i>I know why.</i>

19:21.840 --> 19:23.120
<i>It's these damn kids.</i>

19:23.320 --> 19:26.300
<i>They don't hate their parents--</i>

19:26.500 --> 19:28.130
<i>at least not enough</i>

19:28.330 --> 19:30.130
<i>to never ask them</i>
<i>for anything again.</i>

19:30.330 --> 19:31.470
Yeah, I got it.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.390
<i>The trouble is,</i>

19:34.590 --> 19:36.530
<i>my generation of parents--</i>

19:36.730 --> 19:40.400
<i>we can't let our kids feel</i>
<i>any pain in any way.</i>

19:40.600 --> 19:42.790
<i>It's a sick cycle,</i>

19:42.990 --> 19:44.400
<i>but to stop,</i>

19:44.600 --> 19:46.670
<i>that would take</i>
<i>courage and conviction.</i>

19:46.870 --> 19:49.540
No. No way.
It's your turn.

19:49.740 --> 19:51.540
I can't ask my mother for money
twice in six months.

19:51.740 --> 19:52.500
I can't do that.

19:52.700 --> 19:53.590
Why not?

19:53.790 --> 19:54.630
She just became
a general manager.

19:54.830 --> 19:56.200
Yeah, of a Circle K!

19:56.400 --> 19:57.670
- It's not fair!
- Fine!

19:59.500 --> 20:00.860
I know my dad.

20:01.060 --> 20:02.290
He's gonna hold this against me.

20:02.490 --> 20:03.470
Well, your mom's the one

20:03.670 --> 20:04.900
who handles
all the finances, right?

20:05.100 --> 20:05.990
He's probably
not even going to notice

20:06.190 --> 20:07.030
that she lent us the money.

20:08.110 --> 20:09.170
That's true.

20:09.370 --> 20:10.770
He doesn't notice anything.

20:13.510 --> 20:15.480
When she gave me
our Cancun money,

20:15.680 --> 20:16.780
she said
if I borrowed money again,

20:16.980 --> 20:19.530
she'd make me sit down
and learn Quicken.

20:19.730 --> 20:20.750
Which isn't me, you know?

20:20.940 --> 20:22.530
I know...

20:22.730 --> 20:23.700
I know.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.050
It's gotta be my dad.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.720
It's about respect.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.460
Gracie, why does this stuff
still bother you?

20:38.660 --> 20:39.850
You know who he is.

20:40.050 --> 20:41.200
Why something is wrong

20:41.400 --> 20:43.240
isn't relevant
to making it right.

20:44.630 --> 20:45.860
I can't do anything about it.

20:46.060 --> 20:46.950
Of course not.

20:47.140 --> 20:48.250
Hank's chair of the department.

20:48.450 --> 20:50.340
Course review
falls under his purview.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.690
As long as he's chair,

20:52.890 --> 20:54.870
there can't be
any serious action

20:55.070 --> 20:56.560
taken against him
or anyone else.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.130
"As long as he's chair"?

20:58.330 --> 20:59.180
Seriously?

20:59.370 --> 21:00.910
Hank's your problem, too.

21:02.730 --> 21:05.390
I mean,
there is a person there.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.270
There was a time
you couldn't resist me.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.010
No one could.

21:20.490 --> 21:22.070
Excuse the interruption.

21:22.270 --> 21:23.760
The president's office
said to let you know

21:23.960 --> 21:25.550
that he explained the urgency
of the situation

21:25.750 --> 21:26.720
to the board chair,

21:26.920 --> 21:28.590
and the trustees
will convene next week.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.080
When you find out when it is,

21:31.280 --> 21:32.430
please clear that day.

21:32.630 --> 21:33.680
[Jill] Will do.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.740
This isn't about
hitting Hank with the notebook?

21:40.940 --> 21:41.780
Because he--

21:41.980 --> 21:44.660
he walked into it a bit.

21:44.850 --> 21:47.960
One day, I'm going to meet
an English professor

21:48.160 --> 21:49.270
who understands that the world

21:49.470 --> 21:51.920
is full of lots of people
and ideas...

21:52.120 --> 21:53.750
You could just say yes or no.

21:53.950 --> 21:55.130
There's no need to be insulting.

21:56.660 --> 21:58.230
Is it about
Rourke's new course?

21:58.430 --> 21:59.230
Oh, my god.

22:02.750 --> 22:03.980
[Gracie] <i>I'm telling you guys,</i>

22:04.180 --> 22:05.980
<i>this is the best thing</i>
<i>for our department.</i>

22:06.180 --> 22:08.200
Gracie, this is very serious,

22:08.400 --> 22:09.680
and I have to say,

22:09.880 --> 22:12.730
we don't feel comfortable
plotting behind Hank's back.

22:12.930 --> 22:14.210
This is a good idea.

22:14.410 --> 22:15.460
Okay. Let's see
what we can get.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.730
<i>This isn't something</i>
<i>we should take lightly,</i>

22:19.930 --> 22:22.300
<i>and it is the best thing</i>
<i>for the students, too.</i>

22:22.500 --> 22:23.740
Gosh, Gracie,

22:23.940 --> 22:26.170
it seems like a lot of risk
for not a lot of reward.

22:26.370 --> 22:29.830
<i>Okay, if you support</i>
<i>Hank's de-chairing,</i>

22:30.030 --> 22:31.950
<i>I'll switch places with you</i>
<i>on the sabbatical waitlist.</i>

22:35.650 --> 22:38.010
[train whistle blowing]

22:38.210 --> 22:41.140
[phone buzzing]

22:44.790 --> 22:46.140
Hank, your phone.

22:51.630 --> 22:53.030
Yeah?

22:53.230 --> 22:54.680
[Billie] <i>Hello, Spanky.</i>

22:54.880 --> 22:55.900
Billie.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.160
How drunk are you?

22:57.360 --> 22:59.160
Plenty, but it's none of
your damn business,

22:59.360 --> 23:00.120
you son of a bitch.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.340
Hey, did you write

23:01.540 --> 23:03.040
that recommendation
for my daughter?

23:03.240 --> 23:04.390
I will.

23:04.590 --> 23:06.690
<i>You will not.</i>

23:06.890 --> 23:08.220
<i>I don't want Meg living</i>

23:08.420 --> 23:09.130
<i>this damn life</i>

23:09.330 --> 23:10.860
in this damn town.

23:12.950 --> 23:15.180
Ugh. What do you know
about raising a kid?

23:15.380 --> 23:16.350
You didn't even have a dad.

23:17.610 --> 23:18.840
I did.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.530
<i>You were in diapers</i>
<i>when that shithead left.</i>

23:20.730 --> 23:22.190
I was 14.

23:22.390 --> 23:24.490
<i>You didn't even send</i>
<i>your daughter to college.</i>

23:24.690 --> 23:25.930
<i>What the hell is her name?</i>

23:26.130 --> 23:28.400
I'd prefer you didn't
bring up my daughter.

23:33.490 --> 23:34.770
Billie?

23:34.960 --> 23:35.970
You there?

23:37.500 --> 23:39.330
<i>How come you always</i>
<i>let me talk to you like this?</i>

23:43.500 --> 23:46.390
Look, just don't write
the recommendation,

23:46.590 --> 23:47.560
even though who knows

23:47.760 --> 23:48.900
what it's gonna be worth
after tomorrow.

23:50.550 --> 23:51.520
Tomorrow?

23:51.720 --> 23:52.900
What happens tomorrow?

23:54.210 --> 23:55.690
So you're gonna be de-chaired?

23:57.170 --> 23:58.310
And then what does that mean?

23:58.510 --> 23:59.620
[Hank] De-chaired.

23:59.820 --> 24:01.180
I think

24:01.380 --> 24:03.090
it's an outpatient procedure
these days.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.750
Well, if I'm no longer chair,

24:06.950 --> 24:09.540
it's easier to fire me,

24:09.740 --> 24:12.980
and if I get fired,

24:13.180 --> 24:15.450
that's the end
of my academic career.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.060
You're smiling.

24:23.670 --> 24:24.850
Am I?

24:27.550 --> 24:29.560
Is that, um, opportunity

24:29.760 --> 24:30.910
for you to be

24:31.110 --> 24:33.770
assistant head of school
at Arlyle still possible?

24:34.950 --> 24:35.770
Seriously?

24:38.560 --> 24:39.950
Um...

24:41.560 --> 24:44.360
I mean, that was months ago,
so I don't...

24:44.560 --> 24:45.620
I don't know.

24:45.820 --> 24:47.050
I mean...

24:47.250 --> 24:48.440
Yeah, I could ask.

24:50.610 --> 24:51.620
New York.

24:52.750 --> 24:54.630
God.

24:54.830 --> 24:56.140
Could it finally be time?

24:58.580 --> 25:00.930
MOMA, instead of Roger's Art.

25:02.580 --> 25:04.330
Peter Luger's
instead of Outback.

25:04.530 --> 25:05.980
Mm...

25:08.200 --> 25:09.940
I mean, we'd be a little close
to your father.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.640
It's a city
of eight million people.

25:13.770 --> 25:15.690
I think I can avoid him.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.780
I don't know.

25:17.980 --> 25:19.820
We saw Catherine Keener twice.

25:24.210 --> 25:25.350
Do you know you make a move

25:25.550 --> 25:28.400
every time I say
"Catherine Keener"?

25:28.600 --> 25:30.520
Keep saying it,
see what it gets you.

25:43.010 --> 25:43.850
[phone buzzing]

25:44.050 --> 25:45.550
Yes?

25:45.750 --> 25:47.770
[woman] <i>Hi. Am I speaking</i>
<i>with Professor Devereaux Jr.?</i>

25:47.970 --> 25:49.030
Just Professor Devereaux.

25:49.230 --> 25:50.550
I've never had any confusion.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.640
<i>Yes. Hello,</i>
<i>Professor Devereaux.</i>

25:52.840 --> 25:54.640
<i>This is Marnie Cole</i>
<i>from your father's office.</i>

25:57.810 --> 26:00.550
<i>Um, I hate to bother you</i>
<i>like this, but...</i>

26:01.770 --> 26:03.130
Yeah?

26:03.330 --> 26:04.520
<i>Stephanie asked me to call</i>

26:04.720 --> 26:06.050
<i>and let you know</i>
<i>that she has left your father.</i>

26:06.250 --> 26:07.700
Stephanie?
Is that the maid?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.270
<i>She's his wife.</i>

26:09.470 --> 26:13.050
Uh, okay, well, I guess
he'll have to get a third wife.

26:13.250 --> 26:14.660
<i>Well, that was his third wife.</i>

26:14.860 --> 26:17.010
Well, I wish her well then.

26:17.210 --> 26:20.320
<i>So, it's not an ideal time</i>
<i>for him to be alone.</i>

26:20.520 --> 26:22.410
<i>I think</i>
<i>maybe he could use some help.</i>

26:22.610 --> 26:24.370
Marnie, um, I'm sorry.

26:24.570 --> 26:25.890
In the future,

26:26.090 --> 26:27.760
could you leave
messages like this

26:27.960 --> 26:29.770
with my assistant
in my office, okay?

26:29.970 --> 26:31.420
'Cause this is
my personal cell.

26:31.620 --> 26:34.160
This is only for friends
and work and family

26:34.360 --> 26:35.820
and marketing calls.

26:36.020 --> 26:37.430
Okay? You have
that other number?

26:37.630 --> 26:40.170
<i>I do, but he is your family.</i>

26:40.370 --> 26:41.820
Well, then he can call me.

26:42.020 --> 26:43.730
<i>That would be</i>
<i>the first time in 15 years.</i>

26:47.380 --> 26:49.700
I'm submitting
an alternate budget.

26:49.900 --> 26:50.870
Good.

26:51.070 --> 26:53.040
The first one was so boring.

26:57.090 --> 26:59.190
Could you run
the freshman requirements

26:59.390 --> 27:03.840
and service a major
with five professors, or...

27:04.040 --> 27:06.230
or four professors
and add a few more adjuncts?

27:07.880 --> 27:09.720
I need an answer
or I'm just gonna guess.

27:09.920 --> 27:10.720
Oh...

27:10.920 --> 27:12.770
this is fun.

27:12.970 --> 27:14.670
I like that we do this
every year.

27:15.850 --> 27:16.860
You know,
we could skip the stage

27:17.060 --> 27:17.810
where you threaten cuts

27:18.010 --> 27:18.860
and jump right to the part

27:19.060 --> 27:20.250
where you give me
my full budget.

27:20.450 --> 27:22.210
I've got
a fantasy pickleball league

27:22.410 --> 27:23.250
that's heating up.

27:23.450 --> 27:24.770
I don't have time for this.

27:26.860 --> 27:28.030
What?

27:30.300 --> 27:32.220
Jacob, what is it?

27:32.420 --> 27:33.660
You may have noticed

27:33.860 --> 27:36.920
that half the schools
in the country are broke.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.140
I noticed they're going out
to dinner less often.

27:39.340 --> 27:41.450
Well, think about

27:41.650 --> 27:44.270
what you can pull off
with three fewer professors.

27:48.310 --> 27:50.620
If I'm still chair in an hour,
I'll do that.

27:56.540 --> 27:58.640
Uh, first of all,

27:58.840 --> 28:00.070
I'd like to, um,

28:00.270 --> 28:01.160
I'd like to point out that,

28:01.360 --> 28:02.820
although I am
completely agnostic

28:03.020 --> 28:04.820
as to the outcome of the vote
that's about to take place--

28:05.020 --> 28:06.170
Paul, can you join us?

28:06.370 --> 28:08.430
Thank you. Thank you.

28:08.630 --> 28:10.480
Um, I was asked...

28:10.670 --> 28:11.480
by Dean Rose--

28:11.680 --> 28:13.090
Yeah, right.

28:13.290 --> 28:15.510
...to call this meeting
and motion for a vote.

28:21.650 --> 28:24.140
I heard that there was a vote
to remove me as chair.

28:24.340 --> 28:26.140
I just--
I didn't want to miss it.

28:26.340 --> 28:27.540
Jesus, Billie.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.180
Oh, what's
the goddamned difference?

28:36.710 --> 28:39.640
So, um,
Professor Wheemer has agreed

28:39.830 --> 28:40.810
to run the proceedings.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.160
I didn't really.

28:42.360 --> 28:43.680
[Billie] Weiner?

28:43.880 --> 28:44.680
She's not a professor.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.030
She shows movies.

28:46.230 --> 28:47.380
How is that teaching?

28:47.580 --> 28:48.690
She's a projectionist.

28:48.890 --> 28:50.780
Okay, it's "Wheemer"
with an "M",

28:50.980 --> 28:53.520
and I don't want to be running
these proceedings.

28:53.720 --> 28:54.690
I shouldn't.

28:54.890 --> 28:56.040
It's not fair.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.350
People around the world

28:57.550 --> 28:58.830
don't have access
to free speech,

28:59.030 --> 29:00.740
and I should just feel free

29:00.940 --> 29:03.830
to go on about calls
and recounts and whatnot?

29:04.030 --> 29:05.270
It's obscene.

29:05.470 --> 29:06.960
Okay, thanks, we got it.
Go, now.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.540
Okay, we're here
for a no-confidence vote

29:11.740 --> 29:13.320
for the chair of the department,

29:13.520 --> 29:14.890
for certain events

29:15.090 --> 29:16.500
that have transpired
over the past few days,

29:16.700 --> 29:20.750
and how he's conducted himself
in regards to those events.

29:22.410 --> 29:23.720
Would the accused

29:23.920 --> 29:24.850
like to say anything
in his defense before the vote?

29:25.050 --> 29:26.810
The accused?

29:27.010 --> 29:28.160
It was a good flick.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.080
Jodie Foster.
She won an Oscar for that film.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.820
We watch it in
my gender-analysis film class.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.120
New Bedford Chamber of Commerce
hated that movie.

29:34.320 --> 29:35.080
It killed
the Moby Dick tours.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.430
Okay, can we please--?

29:36.630 --> 29:40.030
Yes, the accused
would like to make a statement.

29:43.300 --> 29:45.270
The kid that I yelled at...

29:45.470 --> 29:46.750
okay...

29:46.950 --> 29:48.620

30:10.750 --> 30:11.640
"Aye" means "yes".

30:11.840 --> 30:12.810
Can you just say yes?

30:14.070 --> 30:15.210
[Emma] Short answer,
yes with caveats.

30:15.410 --> 30:16.780
It requires a vote.

30:16.980 --> 30:17.910
You can make that motion,

30:18.110 --> 30:19.650
but not until
a call for new business.

30:19.850 --> 30:21.520
And I assume
you can get it seconded.

30:21.720 --> 30:24.570
I second the motion
that "aye" means "yes".

30:24.770 --> 30:26.920
Well, there hasn't been
a call for new business.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.270
