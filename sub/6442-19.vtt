00:11.300 --> 00:12.767
Where is he?

00:12.935 --> 00:14.562
Out there.

00:14.804 --> 00:16.897
If anyone approaches,
he becomes hysterical.

00:17.073 --> 00:19.701
He claims he's protecting
his brother, Julian.

00:20.676 --> 00:22.803
Thank you. I'll handle this,
Mr. Woodruff.

00:22.979 --> 00:25.777
-Mr. Luthor--
-He's my son.

00:52.308 --> 00:54.640
Lex?

01:01.284 --> 01:03.445
Lex.

01:03.619 --> 01:06.952
If this is an attempt to get
yourself expelled, it's not gonna work.

01:09.392 --> 01:11.758
You'll wake the baby.

01:12.261 --> 01:14.456
Lex, Julian's gone.

01:15.898 --> 01:17.923
He's right here.

01:18.100 --> 01:21.263
I found him inside of my dorm, crying.

01:21.837 --> 01:24.465
I told him I'd never let
anyone hurt him again.

01:24.640 --> 01:28.667
Julian is dead, Lex. We both know why.

01:28.844 --> 01:32.302
You have to come
to terms with that. Now!

01:32.481 --> 01:36.383
-No, leave us alone!
-No, Lex! What are you doing?

01:36.552 --> 01:37.985
Just go home!

01:38.154 --> 01:41.555
-Lex, come down off that ledge.
-Stay away from us!

01:41.724 --> 01:44.852
Stop this, Lex. Get down. Now!

01:45.027 --> 01:47.860
-Julian needs me!
-Lex! No!

01:51.167 --> 01:52.998
Julian!

01:53.169 --> 01:54.830
Julian!

01:56.339 --> 01:57.966
Lex!

01:58.140 --> 02:00.904
-Stop it, Lex!
-Julian!

02:02.078 --> 02:04.546
Julian! Julian!

02:08.684 --> 02:10.151
Lex!

02:16.826 --> 02:18.919
Lex, what were you doing?

02:21.964 --> 02:23.591
Where am l?

03:23.959 --> 03:25.790
Hope I'm not interrupting.

03:25.961 --> 03:28.862
Chloe told me
you were farm-bound all week.

03:29.298 --> 03:32.665
Yeah, my dad's cardiologist sent him
to Metropolis for some more tests...

03:32.835 --> 03:35.827
-...so I'm pulling double duty.
-I thought he was getting better.

03:36.005 --> 03:38.940
He is, but when your heart's been
through something like that...

03:39.108 --> 03:41.736
...the scars just don't
magically disappear.

03:42.611 --> 03:43.942
No.

03:44.113 --> 03:45.944
No, I guess they don't.

03:47.750 --> 03:52.619
But I'm sure you didn't come all this way
just to admire my stall-mucking abilities.

03:54.924 --> 03:57.392
I think there's something wrong with Lex.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.529
I was dropping off the Talon payroll...

04:00.696 --> 04:05.633
...and I found him out on the ledge,
screaming for someone named Julian.

04:10.372 --> 04:11.771
What is it, Clark?

04:16.077 --> 04:19.377
Julian was the name
of Lex's baby brother.

04:19.548 --> 04:22.072
He died of SlDS when Lex was a kid.

04:22.985 --> 04:25.044
Did he give you any kind of explanation?

04:25.521 --> 04:27.045
No.

04:28.290 --> 04:30.121
He shrugged it off as a bad dream.

04:31.794 --> 04:34.319
Last time Lex had a breakdown...

04:34.497 --> 04:39.127
...I found him over there, singing a lullaby
to a blanket he thought was Julian.

04:41.770 --> 04:43.397
Well, maybe he's had a relapse.

04:44.406 --> 04:46.874
Whatever it is,
you better stay clear for a while.

04:47.042 --> 04:48.737
Clark, he's my friend.

04:49.345 --> 04:52.542
The last time Lex went off the deep end,
you got trampled by a horse.

04:52.715 --> 04:55.206
-Lex didn't mean to hurt me.
-But he did.

04:55.384 --> 04:58.945
And I promised myself
I wouldn't let that happen again.

05:02.258 --> 05:03.850
I'll talk to him.

05:08.497 --> 05:12.831
Well, tell him I'm on my way and he needs
to clear his schedule for the afternoon.

05:17.573 --> 05:21.270
Lana told you about my
nocturnal adventure, didn't she?

05:21.544 --> 05:25.446
I could see I spooked her,
and that usually sends her running to you.

05:26.148 --> 05:27.911
Are you okay?

05:28.217 --> 05:31.209
Well, I haven't lost my mind, Clark,
if that's what you mean.

05:32.488 --> 05:35.855
I just indulged in a little
harmless sleepwalking, that's all.

05:37.359 --> 05:39.919
Lex, you were on a ledge,
yelling Julian's name.

05:40.095 --> 05:42.063
You could've killed yourself.

05:44.233 --> 05:47.532
You know, when I found you asleep
in the middle of Route 8 last year...

05:47.703 --> 05:50.570
...I don't remember questioning
your mental health.

05:55.911 --> 05:59.210
I hadn't just spent seven weeks
at Belle Reve.

06:02.851 --> 06:05.285
According to my doctors, I'm cured.

06:05.454 --> 06:09.288
But apparently a clean bill of health
isn't good enough for Clark Kent.

06:12.928 --> 06:15.192
I can take care of myself.

06:45.294 --> 06:48.058
These nightmares
are becoming more frequent.

06:48.230 --> 06:49.993
They're not nightmares, Lex.

06:50.165 --> 06:52.963
They're spontaneous memories.

06:53.135 --> 06:54.762
Look, Dr. Garner...

06:54.937 --> 06:58.896
...whatever you call them,
they're starting to impact my waking life.

06:59.708 --> 07:04.168
The electroshock therapy
atrophied this part of your brain.

07:04.346 --> 07:07.577
These memories are the equivalent
of a muscle spasm.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.843
They indicate that
the treatment's working.

07:10.152 --> 07:11.744
Doctor.

07:11.987 --> 07:15.684
I didn't come to you to relive
repressed childhood traumas.

07:15.858 --> 07:18.986
If you're concerned,
we can stop at any time.

07:23.966 --> 07:26.230
The choice is yours.

07:41.116 --> 07:42.777
Run scan.

07:50.893 --> 07:52.554
Sequencing.

07:52.728 --> 07:55.253
Just relax, Lex.

07:55.964 --> 07:59.900
Close your eyes and open
the door to your mind.

08:00.335 --> 08:03.099
Think about your father.

08:03.472 --> 08:05.872
Take us back to where we left off.

08:14.349 --> 08:16.340
Where are you now?

08:17.119 --> 08:19.883
My 1 2th birthday party.

08:23.158 --> 08:24.648
Lex?

08:35.938 --> 08:39.203
I'm sorry, son, that your...

08:39.374 --> 08:44.107
...friends didn't get to see the beautiful
party that your mother planned for you.

08:44.279 --> 08:47.112
I told you nobody would come.

08:47.716 --> 08:49.616
Everybody hates me.

08:50.119 --> 08:51.484
That's not true.

08:58.894 --> 09:00.418
Lex.

09:01.396 --> 09:03.023
Lex.

09:06.635 --> 09:08.535
They're jealous, Lex.

09:08.704 --> 09:11.172
You're a Luthor, and you're....

09:11.807 --> 09:13.274
You're--

09:15.043 --> 09:20.572
You're special, and it's always gonna
be difficult for others to accept that.

09:24.887 --> 09:26.548
I....

09:31.593 --> 09:33.424
Lex, here.

09:33.595 --> 09:39.261
Your mother wanted to give you this
in person, but she's resting, so....

09:39.835 --> 09:41.097
Is she okay?

09:44.072 --> 09:46.165
She seemed so sad.

09:46.708 --> 09:48.767
No. No, she's....

09:48.944 --> 09:52.141
She's just tired, that's all.

09:52.314 --> 09:55.181
This pregnancy's been very difficult
for her...

09:55.350 --> 10:00.219
...but once the baby comes,
I know she'll be as excited as we are.

10:00.389 --> 10:01.879
Here.

10:10.432 --> 10:12.366
It's just an old box.

10:13.602 --> 10:15.399
No, no. It's much more than that.

10:15.571 --> 10:20.668
This box was forged
from the armor of St. George.

10:20.843 --> 10:22.834
-The dragon slayer?
-That's right.

10:23.011 --> 10:25.309
According to the legend, St. George...

10:25.480 --> 10:29.109
...was fighting a particularly
fierce dragon.

10:29.284 --> 10:32.879
The battle between them
had raged on for days...

10:33.055 --> 10:36.149
...and St. George
was losing his strength...

10:36.625 --> 10:37.887
...and his faith.

10:38.260 --> 10:41.320
So he took a piece of broken armor...

10:41.496 --> 10:44.431
...and he made it into this box.

10:44.600 --> 10:49.731
Inside it, he put all his doubts
and his fears...

10:50.706 --> 10:54.039
...and then he went out to face
the dragon again.

10:54.209 --> 10:56.336
-Without any armor?
-Yeah.

10:56.511 --> 11:01.005
But when the dragon saw St. George
coming to do battle with him again...

11:01.183 --> 11:03.515
...it hesitated and drew back.

11:03.685 --> 11:09.214
And in that moment, St. George plunged
his sword into the dragon's heart...

11:10.759 --> 11:12.420
...and it fell dead.

11:14.062 --> 11:16.496
So when people are cruel to you...

11:16.665 --> 11:19.225
...you take all your fears
and your doubts...

11:19.401 --> 11:23.064
...you put them in here,
in this box...

11:23.238 --> 11:25.570
...and then you lock it.

11:26.742 --> 11:29.973
Then you'll find that you're....

11:30.479 --> 11:33.039
You're stronger than you think you are.

11:50.999 --> 11:52.261
Bring him up.

11:52.434 --> 11:54.095
That was a good session, Lex.

11:54.269 --> 11:55.998
We're making progress.

12:26.435 --> 12:29.199
What are you doing with Dr. Garner, Lex?

12:29.471 --> 12:31.371
I thought I told you to stay out of this.

12:31.540 --> 12:34.532
Lex, you know what he did to Molly.
And to Ryan.

12:34.977 --> 12:37.775
-Lex, he's dangerous.
-I don't have to explain myself to you.

12:37.946 --> 12:39.277
Yes, you do, Lex.

12:39.448 --> 12:42.008
I can't understand why my
best friend keeps lying to me.

12:42.184 --> 12:44.209
What if you lost seven weeks of your life?

12:46.855 --> 12:48.948
That's what this is about.

12:49.391 --> 12:52.918
Clark, if I could retrieve those memories,
they would give me the answers...

12:53.095 --> 12:55.256
...to the questions
that have been plaguing me.

12:55.430 --> 12:57.694
But Dr. Garner knows no boundaries, Lex.

12:57.866 --> 13:00.494
If you get caught up in his research,
it could kill you.

13:00.669 --> 13:02.500
I don't care.

13:02.738 --> 13:05.070
I'm gonna remember everything.

13:30.565 --> 13:34.001
When I got your call, I was shocked.

13:34.169 --> 13:37.764
I couldn't imagine why you would
want to see me.

13:39.541 --> 13:43.739
Lex is using a highly experimental
procedure at Summerholt lnstitute.

13:45.180 --> 13:48.047
He's trying to retrieve
the memories he forgot.

13:51.119 --> 13:55.180
Mr. Luthor, you're the only one powerful
enough to shut Summerholt down.

13:55.357 --> 14:00.795
Well, I'm flattered by your rather
naive view of my business prowess...

14:01.096 --> 14:04.793
...but why do you think I would resort
to behaving like a thug?

14:06.835 --> 14:10.066
Because I don't think you really want
Lex to remember what he forgot.

14:12.174 --> 14:15.405
No one cares more about Lex's
mental health than I do, Clark...

14:15.577 --> 14:19.911
...but it's not my prerogative to stop him
from regaining those lost memories.

14:24.086 --> 14:27.351
Even if he uncovers the truth
about his grandparents' death?

14:30.225 --> 14:31.624
You know, Clark...

14:31.793 --> 14:36.093
...I always thought that your parents'
corn-fed hokum had made you weak...

14:36.264 --> 14:40.633
...but clearly, I have underestimated
your dark side.

14:41.503 --> 14:43.664
I'm trying to save my friend.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.473
No, you're not.

14:46.641 --> 14:51.442
You came here trying to strong-arm me
under the guise of concern for Lex.

14:51.613 --> 14:54.605
But it's you who doesn't want
him to regain his memory.

14:54.783 --> 14:56.717
That's not true.

15:01.490 --> 15:04.015
I know your secret, Clark.

15:04.793 --> 15:07.785
I know your secret, Clark.

15:14.102 --> 15:17.833
You want Lex to stop this highly
dangerous therapy?

15:21.042 --> 15:24.102
I suggest you start telling the truth.

15:33.455 --> 15:35.218
What brings you to Smallville, Dad?

15:36.091 --> 15:38.889
Find more evidence of little green men
in the Kawatche Caves?

15:40.128 --> 15:44.360
Another one of your extracurricular
activities has been brought to my attention.

15:45.901 --> 15:49.894
Your excursions
to the Summerholt lnstitute.

15:51.173 --> 15:53.835
-Where did you hear that?
-Your good friend Clark.

15:57.279 --> 16:01.716
SummerhoIt's
a highly respected institution.

16:01.883 --> 16:03.145
Respected?

16:03.318 --> 16:08.984
Lex, this Garner character operates
on the outer fringes of accepted science.

16:09.157 --> 16:11.557
Well, then you should feel right at home.

16:15.263 --> 16:16.662
Lex...

16:16.831 --> 16:19.561
...your mind is still very fragile.

16:20.001 --> 16:25.200
Why would you risk jeopardizing your sanity
for the sake of a few lost memories?

16:26.474 --> 16:29.034
What's wrong, Dad?

16:29.211 --> 16:30.838
You....

16:31.012 --> 16:33.503
You're afraid of what
I'm gonna remember?

16:33.682 --> 16:36.879
Because so far,
it's been very illuminating.

16:38.820 --> 16:40.412
Lex.

16:40.989 --> 16:43.753
It's foolish for you to go on
with this treatment.

16:43.925 --> 16:47.588
-lt could trigger another psychotic break.
-Look, that's--

17:12.621 --> 17:15.988
Would you get something
to clean that up, please, Mary?

17:16.156 --> 17:18.352
Yes, Mr. Luthor.

17:18.526 --> 17:19.925
No, let me have Julian.

17:22.731 --> 17:25.858
Yes. Yes.

17:26.034 --> 17:28.332
Oh, look at his eyes.

17:30.138 --> 17:34.006
How he looks at you.
Oh, my. Look at that.

17:34.175 --> 17:35.802
Lillian, he's like a prince.

17:35.977 --> 17:38.275
I don't want to hold him.

17:39.447 --> 17:45.044
Lillian, it's unnatural for a mother not
to want to bond with her child. Please.

17:47.022 --> 17:51.618
I will not let you inflict psychological scars
on my children.

17:51.793 --> 17:54.819
That's why they have you, Lionel.

17:56.798 --> 17:58.993
No, you don't mean that, Lillian.

17:59.234 --> 18:01.634
I told you I didn't want
any more children.

18:01.803 --> 18:04.601
I see how you treat Alexander...

18:04.773 --> 18:06.536
...chipping away at his spirit.

18:06.808 --> 18:08.969
Because you have made him weak.

18:09.277 --> 18:11.745
-You'll pit these boys against each other.
-No.

18:11.913 --> 18:14.473
Make them fight for your affection.

18:14.649 --> 18:17.345
I won't let you turn them into monsters.

18:17.519 --> 18:19.248
I want a divorce, Lionel.

18:19.721 --> 18:24.920
Lillian, these threats, these constant
threats of yours are tiresome.

18:25.093 --> 18:27.618
I allowed Lex to come home
for your sake.

18:27.796 --> 18:31.163
Now, you're going to start to try.

18:31.333 --> 18:33.927
Lillian, try.

18:34.836 --> 18:37.771
Try. That's it.

18:40.575 --> 18:44.011
The four of us are going to be a family.

18:45.747 --> 18:48.511
All right, I'm going to give Mary
the night off.

18:48.683 --> 18:53.347
I think you need some time alone
with your son.

19:09.337 --> 19:10.929
Lex?

19:14.576 --> 19:16.168
Lex? What--?

19:18.146 --> 19:19.579
Lex.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.115
Lex, what are you doing?

19:30.392 --> 19:35.694
-Dad, it was an accident.
-Lex, what are you talking about?

19:52.313 --> 19:54.008
Hello, son.

19:54.315 --> 19:57.216
What are you two boys up to, huh?

20:02.090 --> 20:03.751
Lex?

20:09.898 --> 20:12.128
He wouldn't stop crying.

20:12.700 --> 20:15.828
I tried to rock him, and then....

20:20.775 --> 20:22.936
You have to believe me.

20:24.512 --> 20:26.503
What have you done, Lex?

20:30.852 --> 20:32.217
What...?

20:38.793 --> 20:40.727
What have you done?

21:01.349 --> 21:02.839
What have you done?

21:04.586 --> 21:07.054
What have you done?!

21:10.458 --> 21:12.926
Lex. Son?

21:13.094 --> 21:15.460
-What happened?
-I don't know. We were talking...

21:15.630 --> 21:18.190
...you went into a catatonic state and--

21:18.366 --> 21:21.858
-I'll call a doctor, all right?
-Don't bother. I'm fine. I'm fine.

21:31.012 --> 21:34.106
This is a side effect of your treatment,
isn't it?

21:37.285 --> 21:39.947
-You're playing with fire, son.
-Stop it!

21:42.824 --> 21:46.521
You only care about preventing me
from getting back those seven weeks.

21:46.694 --> 21:49.162
I've got nothing to hide from you, Lex.

21:49.330 --> 21:53.790
You spend too much time living
in the past. Start looking to the future.

21:53.968 --> 21:54.957
Get out.

21:55.336 --> 21:58.100
-That's always been your weakness.
-Get out!

22:12.220 --> 22:14.211
I love you too, sweetheart.

22:14.389 --> 22:16.152
Okay, bye.

22:16.324 --> 22:19.851
I just spoke to your dad. He's well,
but they want him to stay an extra day.

22:20.028 --> 22:21.495
Did you tell him about Lex?

22:21.663 --> 22:25.565
I thought it better to keep that under wraps
until it looks like more of a threat.

22:25.733 --> 22:28.293
Unfortunately,
I'm afraid that time has come.

22:28.469 --> 22:30.630
Excuse the intrusion, the door was open.

22:30.805 --> 22:32.102
What are you doing here?

22:34.576 --> 22:38.512
Clark didn't tell you?
He came to see me.

22:42.450 --> 22:46.216
Your son has always had...

22:46.554 --> 22:48.488
...a penchant for secrecy.

22:50.358 --> 22:52.519
Mom, can you give us a minute?

22:53.127 --> 22:54.526
Sure.

22:56.731 --> 22:58.062
Martha, l--

22:58.232 --> 23:00.393
Would you...

23:00.568 --> 23:03.002
...give my best wishes to your--?
To Jonathan.

23:03.171 --> 23:09.599
I'm sure it must be a challenge for him
to run the farm in his weakened condition.

23:09.777 --> 23:13.474
Don't worry about Jonathan, he'll be fine.

23:14.616 --> 23:18.347
His strength of character
will see us through anything.

23:24.492 --> 23:26.619
I miss your sage advice, Martha.

23:28.262 --> 23:32.824
There's always a job waiting for you if you
ever want to come back to LuthorCorp.

23:45.446 --> 23:48.745
Thank you, Clark, for letting me know
what Lex has been up to.

23:48.916 --> 23:52.181
Unfortunately, our collective
meddling has...

23:52.353 --> 23:54.913
...convinced him to accelerate
the whole process.

23:55.456 --> 23:57.686
But he could seriously hurt himself.

23:57.859 --> 24:01.420
I know, but he's an adult, Clark...

24:02.063 --> 24:05.226
...and people have to make
their own mistakes sometimes...

24:05.400 --> 24:08.892
...before they realize they've gone down
the wrong path.

24:09.270 --> 24:12.535
What if he doesn't?
What if he comes out of this a vegetable?

24:14.609 --> 24:17.942
Well, then I'll have no choice...

24:19.414 --> 24:25.080
...but to have him committed again
to Belle Reve. This time permanently.

24:28.056 --> 24:29.717
Where is he?

24:37.498 --> 24:39.125
Where's Lex?

24:39.567 --> 24:41.865
How did you get in here?
I'm calling security.

24:42.036 --> 24:45.096
If he continues his experiments,
his father will have him institutionalized.

24:45.273 --> 24:47.833
Lex is well aware of the risks.

24:50.912 --> 24:54.643
What's the matter, Mr. Kent?
You're not looking well.

24:55.249 --> 24:57.683
You have to stop what you're doing.

25:06.728 --> 25:10.186
You've always been intrigued
with my research.

25:10.531 --> 25:15.093
And now you're going to have
the opportunity to be a part of it.

25:17.205 --> 25:18.900
Strip him.

25:42.296 --> 25:44.093
The mouse took the bait.

25:45.366 --> 25:50.326
All right. Now I've delivered my end
of the deal, I expect you to live up to yours.

25:51.038 --> 25:54.337
Lex will never undergo another
treatment at Summerholt.

25:54.509 --> 25:58.946
Now we can put your talents to use
on a far more interesting project.

26:00.681 --> 26:05.141
I want us to begin studying Clark Kent...

26:06.187 --> 26:07.677
...immediately.

26:38.586 --> 26:39.814
We're ready.

26:39.987 --> 26:42.012
I'll feed you the questions, all right?

26:42.190 --> 26:45.591
I want to know the truth
about Clark Kent.

26:47.128 --> 26:49.187
Where does he come from?

27:00.708 --> 27:01.936
I'm here to see Dr. Garner.

27:02.109 --> 27:05.636
Dr. Garner left word with your assistant.
Your session's been canceled.

27:05.813 --> 27:08.543
I got the message.
I wanna speak with him personally.

27:09.116 --> 27:12.108
Well, I'm afraid he's off-site
at a seminar.

27:16.324 --> 27:18.087
Thank you.

27:29.503 --> 27:31.164
Lex, I'm in a meeting.

27:31.339 --> 27:35.036
At Summerholt? Is that why Dr. Garner
canceled my session?

27:35.676 --> 27:37.166
I don't have time for this now.

27:37.345 --> 27:40.872
Then you better make time
because my treatment worked.

27:41.382 --> 27:43.816
I remember everything.

27:47.088 --> 27:49.886
-Where are you?
- You know where I am, Dad.

27:54.295 --> 27:58.254
I have to solve a problem.
Wait till I get back.

28:01.535 --> 28:03.969
Lower him into the tank.

28:04.372 --> 28:05.805
I'm not waiting for anyone.

28:24.158 --> 28:28.026
Clark, I need you to relax.

28:28.796 --> 28:31.492
Take me back to your earliest memory.

28:32.266 --> 28:34.166
Where did you come from?

28:42.877 --> 28:44.902
Put him inside, Lara.

28:45.079 --> 28:47.206
Our time has passed.

28:47.381 --> 28:49.349
The hourglass is empty.

28:49.517 --> 28:52.315
What if they don't love him?

28:52.687 --> 28:56.384
Lara, his destiny is set...

28:56.691 --> 28:58.818
...as is ours.

28:59.260 --> 29:02.195
Goodbye, my sweet Kal-El.

29:22.883 --> 29:27.081
Lara! Lara!

29:27.421 --> 29:29.389
Who's Lara, Clark?

29:31.325 --> 29:32.986
Why isn't he responding?

29:33.160 --> 29:36.755
I'm not sure, doctor, but he's having
some sort of reaction to the solution.

29:37.965 --> 29:39.830
-Lara!
-We need to pull him out.

29:40.001 --> 29:41.764
No. He hasn't told us what we want.

29:41.936 --> 29:44.234
Lara!

29:44.405 --> 29:45.736
Lex?

29:47.408 --> 29:50.536
Lex, what's so urgent that you needed
to call me out of a meeting?

29:50.711 --> 29:52.042
What's the problem, son?

29:52.213 --> 29:53.737
I don't know, Dad.

29:53.914 --> 29:55.939
But the fact that you
co-opted Dr. Garner...

29:56.117 --> 29:59.644
...tells me that you really are scared
of the memories I could recover.

30:00.087 --> 30:01.850
What did you give him?

30:06.027 --> 30:07.358
Shut it down!

30:19.140 --> 30:22.701
-What the hell was that?
-The alarm in the memory well was triggered.

30:23.711 --> 30:26.805
Looks like I'm not the only one
playing with fire.

30:28.249 --> 30:29.910
Lex. Lex?

30:31.786 --> 30:33.219
Lex!

31:14.795 --> 31:16.126
Clark.

31:21.168 --> 31:24.695
-Lex, help me.
-I'm gonna get you out of here.

32:00.641 --> 32:03.041
I wanted to see how you were feeling.

32:03.777 --> 32:06.644
-You looked pretty messed up.
-Yeah, I'll survive.

32:10.951 --> 32:13.419
What were you doing
at Summerholt, Clark?

32:15.389 --> 32:17.983
I was trying to save my friend
from making a big mistake.

32:18.159 --> 32:20.127
That was your opinion.

32:20.294 --> 32:23.320
I told you to let it go,
but you kept pursuing it.

32:23.497 --> 32:25.362
You even involved my father.

32:27.134 --> 32:30.069
Believe me, he's the last person
I'd ask for help...

32:30.237 --> 32:34.071
-...but I didn't have any other options.
-He betrayed you, Clark.

32:34.241 --> 32:37.733
He stopped my sessions with Garner
by offering you up as a lab rat.

32:40.247 --> 32:44.081
I've tried to keep my father away
from you, but he's obsessed.

32:44.985 --> 32:48.819
If I'd got back those seven weeks,
I could have finally stopped him.

32:48.989 --> 32:51.651
Maybe, Lex,
or maybe you'd make it worse.

32:54.361 --> 32:58.457
You always tell me how you don't want
to turn into your father, and I believe that...

32:58.632 --> 33:01.999
...but the more you two go at each other,
the more like him you become...

33:02.169 --> 33:03.932
...and the more people get hurt.

33:09.009 --> 33:11.807
I will never become my father.

33:12.780 --> 33:16.739
I would never sacrifice you or anybody
I cared about to bring him down.

33:27.294 --> 33:28.886
Lex...

33:29.396 --> 33:32.126
...why does your father
hate you so much?

33:38.272 --> 33:40.570
Take care of yourself, Clark.

34:24.118 --> 34:25.779
Mom?

34:27.588 --> 34:29.248
Mom?

34:42.335 --> 34:44.304
What did you do?

34:45.606 --> 34:48.574
Don't wake the baby. He's sleeping.

34:58.585 --> 35:00.018
No.

35:00.387 --> 35:02.548
No.

35:06.493 --> 35:08.120
What about Dad?

35:10.364 --> 35:13.026
It's nothing to worry about, sweetheart.

35:14.935 --> 35:17.995
Julian's happy now.

35:37.257 --> 35:38.554
No.

35:48.635 --> 35:51.934
Lex? Are you all right?

35:53.574 --> 35:55.007
Yeah.

35:55.642 --> 35:57.337
Yeah, I'm fine.

36:13.460 --> 36:16.827
I see once again you managed to walk away
from a major debacle unscathed.

36:21.268 --> 36:25.762
I was only there at Summerholt,
Lex, because...

36:26.607 --> 36:28.131
...I was concerned about you.

36:29.977 --> 36:31.308
And Clark.

36:33.714 --> 36:35.705
I was as shocked as you were
to find out...

36:35.883 --> 36:38.852
...that Dr. Garner was holding him there
against his will.

36:40.988 --> 36:43.582
In yesterday's melee,
I didn't get a chance to tell you...

36:43.757 --> 36:47.215
-...about a repressed memory I recovered.
-Oh, Lex.

36:47.394 --> 36:49.259
Don't worry, Dad...

36:50.364 --> 36:53.492
...it wasn't about those seven weeks.

36:56.804 --> 36:58.237
It was about Julian.

37:02.242 --> 37:03.834
Yes, well...

37:04.011 --> 37:10.007
...we put that tragedy
behind us years ago, didn't we?

37:11.685 --> 37:13.243
I didn't kill him.

37:21.094 --> 37:24.063
Lex, I understand that you need...

37:24.231 --> 37:27.325
...to excuse your behavior, but l....

37:29.870 --> 37:34.933
I saw you, Lex.
I saw you standing over Julian's crib.

37:35.843 --> 37:38.311
It's the past. It's history.

37:45.586 --> 37:47.451
Mom did it.

37:51.792 --> 37:53.657
I walked in and I found her.

37:57.731 --> 38:00.199
-That's what I repressed.
-Don't you dare.

38:00.367 --> 38:03.029
I won't let you desecrate
your mother's memory like that.

38:03.203 --> 38:05.763
I don't blame her. I blame you.

38:05.939 --> 38:07.406
What are you talking about?

38:07.574 --> 38:09.599
Your mother loved Julian.
She would never--

38:09.776 --> 38:13.405
She wasn't capable of murdering
her own child. She loved him.

38:13.580 --> 38:17.880
Loved him so much she couldn't subject him
to your particular brand of parenting.

38:25.592 --> 38:27.457
All right, Lex...

38:27.628 --> 38:29.289
...why would you take the blame...

38:29.463 --> 38:33.957
-...for your brother's death?
-Because I was your sole remaining heir.

38:34.935 --> 38:37.904
I knew you wouldn't let anything
happen to me.

38:39.706 --> 38:41.230
But Mom...

38:42.709 --> 38:45.769
...she would be the lamb to the slaughter.

39:03.196 --> 39:04.629
I....

39:06.900 --> 39:09.061
If I'd known-- lf....

39:10.003 --> 39:12.972
-lf I'd seen....
-What?

39:15.142 --> 39:18.771
Things would've been...

39:21.882 --> 39:23.782
...so different between us.

39:31.592 --> 39:33.423
Yes, Dad.

39:36.630 --> 39:39.190
You might have actually loved me.

39:41.969 --> 39:43.334
No.

39:43.837 --> 39:45.429
No.

39:46.473 --> 39:47.963
I--

40:25.812 --> 40:29.976
You barely said anything about what
happened at Summerholt.

40:34.221 --> 40:36.553
Don't worry, Mom, my secret's still safe.

40:42.462 --> 40:43.895
Well....

40:45.532 --> 40:48.865
I'll be in the house if you want to talk.

40:56.176 --> 40:57.905
Lara...

41:02.015 --> 41:05.178
...is my biological mother's real name.

41:07.254 --> 41:09.449
How did you know that?

41:10.023 --> 41:13.424
When I was in the tank,
I saw my earliest memory.

41:14.261 --> 41:16.422
She was putting me in the ship.

41:19.366 --> 41:22.358
Her only fear was that
no one would love me.

41:25.806 --> 41:29.537
I can't imagine the agony of putting
my son in a lifeboat...

41:29.710 --> 41:32.304
...and sending him across the stars.

41:38.919 --> 41:41.649
Because of Jor-El, I always thought...

41:42.889 --> 41:46.450
...that my biological parents were monsters,
but she wasn't.

41:50.530 --> 41:53.294
I just can't believe I forgot about her.

41:54.401 --> 41:56.301
You didn't, Clark.

41:57.237 --> 41:59.205
Your first word was "Lara."

42:01.575 --> 42:04.942
Your father and I could never figure out
what it meant.

42:05.112 --> 42:07.080
Now we know.

42:11.952 --> 42:14.216
I wish she could have met you.

42:14.988 --> 42:17.513
To see what a great mom I have.

42:20.026 --> 42:22.085
She knows, Clark.

42:23.296 --> 42:25.821
A mother's love never dies.
