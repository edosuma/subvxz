10:44.461 --> 10:46.461
MAN:
It's probably fake.

10:46.496 --> 10:48.363
Look...

10:48.398 --> 10:51.466
there's gonna be a lot of
attention on this one, Chloe.

10:51.501 --> 10:53.434
I wouldn't pick at it too hard.

10:53.470 --> 10:55.069
Not after Palmetto Street.

10:55.105 --> 10:58.206
I asked for this case
because of Palmetto Street, Dan.

10:59.364 --> 11:02.377
So, anyway, any witnesses?

11:02.412 --> 11:05.179
LUCIFER:
Lucifer Morningstar.

11:05.215 --> 11:07.849
"Lucifer
Morningstar"?

11:07.884 --> 11:10.885
Is that, uh,
a stage name or something?

11:10.920 --> 11:12.754
(chuckles)
God-given, I'm afraid.

11:12.789 --> 11:13.988
You know,

11:14.024 --> 11:15.056
you look familiar.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.324
Have we met before?

11:16.359 --> 11:19.060
Yeah, five minutes ago.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.294
And I'm asking the questions.

11:20.330 --> 11:23.031
Talk to me about your
relationship with the victim.

11:23.066 --> 11:25.466
Well, she used to work here
a few years back.

11:25.502 --> 11:27.969
I would occasionally
accompany her while she sang.

11:28.004 --> 11:31.406
Then she became a big star and
someone decided to end her life.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.673
Do you know the shooter?

11:32.709 --> 11:34.876
No, but we did have
an interesting little chat

11:34.911 --> 11:36.911
just before he kicked off.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.047
I asked him why he did it.

11:39.082 --> 11:41.099
Huh, like to play cop, do you?

11:41.134 --> 11:41.816
(laughs)

11:41.851 --> 11:44.018
No, I just like to play
in general, Detective.

11:44.054 --> 11:45.787
What about you?

11:45.822 --> 11:48.856
So, you had a conversation
with a dead guy?

11:48.892 --> 11:50.158
Oh, no, he wasn't quite dead.

11:50.193 --> 11:51.934
His soul hadn't
crossed the threshold.

11:52.796 --> 11:55.129
I see.
Did he tell you why he did it?

11:55.165 --> 11:56.998
Why, money, of course.

11:57.033 --> 11:59.267
You humans, you love your money,
don't you?

11:59.302 --> 12:00.902
Yes.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.270
Yes, we do.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.405
And, uh, what planet
are you from... London?

12:04.441 --> 12:05.640
(laughs)

12:05.675 --> 12:08.176
Yes, he also said,
"I just pulled the trigger."

12:08.211 --> 12:10.578
Now, don't you think
that's interesting?

12:10.613 --> 12:12.680
Delilah was shot to death
by a drug dealer.

12:12.715 --> 12:15.683
And looks like Delilah herself
kept the guy pretty busy.

12:15.718 --> 12:18.252
You know, it's sad, it's ugly,
but it's not rocket science.

12:18.288 --> 12:20.121
Something probably
went south between them.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.089
She gets riddled with bullets,

12:21.124 --> 12:23.391
and a nice little act of God
takes him out.

12:23.426 --> 12:25.460
You know, it doesn't work
like that, Detective.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.361
It's quite a neatly wrapped
little present

12:27.397 --> 12:28.896
for the LAPD, don't you think?

12:28.932 --> 12:30.698
Why don't you tell me something?

12:30.733 --> 12:32.166
How does she end up

12:32.202 --> 12:33.434
dying in a hailstorm of bullets,

12:33.470 --> 12:35.203
and you get away
without a scratch?

12:35.238 --> 12:36.971
I think that's interesting.
Don't you?

12:37.006 --> 12:38.272
The benefits of immortality.

12:38.308 --> 12:39.407
"Immortality."

12:39.442 --> 12:40.441
Mm, of course, uh,

12:40.477 --> 12:42.376
you spell that
with one or two M's?

12:42.412 --> 12:43.711
I always forget.

12:43.746 --> 12:46.280
What will your corrupt little
organization do about this?

12:46.316 --> 12:48.483
Excuse me?

12:48.518 --> 12:49.984
Will you find
the person responsible?

12:50.019 --> 12:51.085
Will they be punished?

12:51.121 --> 12:52.653
Will this be a priority for you?

12:52.689 --> 12:54.322
Because it is for me.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.957
You got some balls
on you, pal.

12:55.992 --> 12:58.292
Oh, thank you very much, but
they're really quite average.

12:58.328 --> 12:59.594
I bet.

12:59.629 --> 13:01.429
Now, are you sure
that we haven't met?

13:01.464 --> 13:03.698
I could swear
I've seen you naked.

13:03.733 --> 13:04.632
Have we had sex?

13:06.136 --> 13:07.935
We're done here.

13:07.971 --> 13:08.836
Uh, Detective, wait!

13:08.872 --> 13:10.304
Someone out there
needs to be punished.

13:10.340 --> 13:12.840
- We're not done.
- Yeah. Yeah, we are.

14:03.631 --> 14:04.863
How did you get in here?

14:04.899 --> 14:06.065
Yeah, and quite a lavish one

on the outs.

14:08.602 --> 14:10.169
You do remember me, don't you?

14:10.204 --> 14:11.704
Yeah, yeah, I remember you.

14:11.739 --> 14:14.173
Now, what do you want?
I'm a little busy.

14:14.208 --> 14:16.442
Well, I can't believe
that you're getting married

14:16.477 --> 14:19.111
the day after your ex-fiancée
and once brightest star

14:19.146 --> 14:20.879
was murdered in cold blood.

14:20.915 --> 14:22.381
JIMMY: Yeah,
that's very sad.

14:22.416 --> 14:24.483
But you know what,
she ruined my wedding once.

14:24.518 --> 14:26.185
I'm not about to let
that happen again.

14:26.220 --> 14:27.853
It's hard to be rejected,
isn't it, Jimmy?

14:27.888 --> 14:29.121
Twice.
(chuckles)

14:29.156 --> 14:30.289
JIMMY:
What?

14:30.324 --> 14:31.924
Well, you tried
to get her back recently.

14:31.959 --> 14:33.726
I mean, I'd kill someone
if they denied me once.

14:33.761 --> 14:35.027
Not that that's possible.

14:35.062 --> 14:37.830
So, come on,
what do you say, Jimbo, huh?

14:37.865 --> 14:39.398
Did you want her dead?

14:39.433 --> 14:42.234
Look, stop looking at me
that way, you freak.

14:42.269 --> 14:44.303
I am not playing that
mind game with you.

14:44.338 --> 14:45.471
No, of course not!

14:45.506 --> 14:46.872
I was furious and
I was humiliated

14:46.907 --> 14:49.174
when she dumped me,
but I think, I-I think

14:49.210 --> 14:50.876
I've rebounded pretty well.

14:50.911 --> 14:53.045
Yes, clearly.
Respect.

14:53.080 --> 14:54.947
JIMMY: Should go
play your mind games

14:54.982 --> 14:56.081
with 2Vile.

14:56.117 --> 14:57.750
- The rapper?
- Come on.

14:57.785 --> 14:59.551
Delilah dumped me
for that lunatic.

14:59.587 --> 15:00.853
They were always fighting.

15:00.888 --> 15:02.187
He slapped her
around a bunch.

15:02.223 --> 15:04.723
He surrounds himself with
gun-toting morons 24-7.

15:04.759 --> 15:06.692
He is the real deal.

15:06.727 --> 15:08.560
Right.

15:09.497 --> 15:10.763
Sorry, how rude.

15:10.798 --> 15:12.664

15:23.611 --> 15:25.044
I can't believe
I just said that.

15:25.079 --> 15:26.879
LUCIFER: Oh, no, no, no.
Let's be honest here.

15:26.914 --> 15:28.881
I mean, you're not
marrying this human stain

15:28.916 --> 15:30.916
'cause you're actually
in love with him, right?

15:30.951 --> 15:32.284
- God no.
- No.

15:32.319 --> 15:33.419
Right.

15:33.454 --> 15:34.887
(claps)
Well, I should get going.

15:34.922 --> 15:36.221

16:42.256 --> 16:45.424
What, you don't like hip-hop?

16:45.459 --> 16:46.925
No, I most certainly do not.

16:46.961 --> 16:49.728
Well, that offends me.

16:51.732 --> 16:54.166
You have a problem
with black people?

16:54.201 --> 16:55.367
No, not in the slightest.

16:55.402 --> 16:56.468

- And when I say

16:58.239 --> 16:59.705

I mean <i> your</i> music.

16:59.740 --> 17:01.440
Not the music made
by other black people.

17:01.475 --> 17:04.476
Without the blues, there'd be
no devil's music whatsoever.

17:04.512 --> 17:06.478
There are, of course,
many giants in the field.

17:06.513 --> 17:08.046

am I being clear?

17:08.082 --> 17:09.615
(chuckles) Yeah, you're
being clear all right.

17:09.650 --> 17:11.717
- Good.

to get yourself killed.

Yes, well, don't waste
your munitions... I'm immortal.

17:19.693 --> 17:21.193
Tell me about Delilah.

17:21.228 --> 17:23.028
You ain't seen the news?

17:23.063 --> 17:24.829
Bitch is dead.

17:26.634 --> 17:28.233
(others gasping, murmuring)

17:28.269 --> 17:30.269
(gunshots)

17:31.972 --> 17:33.338
Don't shoot, you idiot!

17:34.575 --> 17:36.542
- I didn't kill her.
- Why should I believe you?

17:36.577 --> 17:38.243
Because I loved the girl.

17:38.279 --> 17:40.279
People sometimes kill people
with whom they're in love.

17:40.314 --> 17:42.181
The heart's mysterious.

17:42.216 --> 17:43.949
- So I'm told.
- Ain't like that.

17:43.984 --> 17:46.318
Girl made me crazy!

17:46.353 --> 17:47.553
Women can do that.

17:47.588 --> 17:49.188
Doesn't mean you should
beat them up, does it?

17:49.223 --> 17:50.689
We worked that out
a long time ago.

17:50.724 --> 17:53.923
I hit her once 'cause I found
out she was cheating on me.

18:00.634 --> 18:01.800
All right.

18:01.835 --> 18:03.101
With whom?

18:03.137 --> 18:04.436
I don't know.
I don't know.

18:04.471 --> 18:05.837
She wouldn't tell me,
all right?

18:05.873 --> 18:07.139
Said it was a big secret,

18:07.174 --> 18:09.608
some-some, uh, rich married guy.

18:09.643 --> 18:11.510
Well, does she have a friend
that she might've confided in?

18:11.545 --> 18:12.844
She didn't trust no one, man.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.413
Uh, uh, her therapist.

18:14.448 --> 18:16.215
Her therapist is probably
the only one who knows.

18:16.250 --> 18:18.283
She-she's some, uh, uh,
Dr. Linda

18:18.319 --> 18:19.418
in-in Beverly Hills.

18:19.453 --> 18:21.687
Saw her, like,
five times a week on the DL.

18:21.722 --> 18:23.589
Used a fake name, everything.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.791
Oh, did she now?

18:25.826 --> 18:28.527
Well, thank you for your time.

18:28.562 --> 18:31.063
CHLOE:
LAPD! Guns down.

18:31.098 --> 18:32.197
On the floor, down!

18:32.233 --> 18:33.665
You two against the wall.

18:33.701 --> 18:36.134
Detective, welcome to the party.

18:36.170 --> 18:37.736
Grab the bucket,
collect the guns.

18:37.771 --> 18:39.638
Now!

18:39.673 --> 18:41.573
You sly dog,
you did listen to me.

18:41.609 --> 18:42.574
I ran the dead guy's cell phone.

18:42.610 --> 18:43.842
2Vile was the last person
he called.

18:43.877 --> 18:45.811
Come on, man.

18:45.846 --> 18:47.980
What I find
highly interesting

18:48.015 --> 18:49.915
is how you made the
connection on your own.

18:49.950 --> 18:51.617
Well, I've been busy, my dear.

18:52.519 --> 18:53.719
Talk to me about Delilah.

18:53.754 --> 18:55.787
We've been over that one,
Detective.

18:55.823 --> 18:57.322
And why you called
the shooter

18:57.358 --> 18:58.790
two days before
she was murdered.

18:58.826 --> 19:01.560
Fine. Yeah, I called Eddie
'cause he hooks me up sometimes.

19:01.595 --> 19:02.961
He met Delilah through me.

19:02.997 --> 19:05.197
Whatever.
Don't make me a killer, do it?

19:05.232 --> 19:07.799
No, but it does
make you a suspect.

19:07.835 --> 19:10.168
What, so everyone on Eddie's
phone's a suspect?

19:10.204 --> 19:11.403
Are you joking?

19:11.438 --> 19:13.905
You gonna drag
half of Hollywood downtown.

19:13.941 --> 19:15.674
Be like the Oscars or something.

19:15.709 --> 19:18.076
Wait, aren't you
that chick from that film?

19:18.112 --> 19:19.611
Hmm, what's this?
What film?

19:19.647 --> 19:20.748
You used to be an actress
or something, right?

19:20.783 --> 19:21.553
Yeah.

19:21.588 --> 19:23.415
That teen movie...
I forget what it's called.

19:23.450 --> 19:26.118
Of course.
<i>Hot Tub High School.</i>

19:26.153 --> 19:27.419
That's where
I know you from.

19:27.454 --> 19:29.021
Let's just stick to my
questions, shall we? So...

19:29.056 --> 19:30.255
The one with
the famous nude scene,

19:30.291 --> 19:31.456
coming out of the hot tub!

19:31.492 --> 19:33.358
It was, like, a complete
<i>Fast Times</i> rip-off.

19:33.394 --> 19:34.926
She was, like,
the new Phoebe Cates!

19:34.962 --> 19:36.395
Thanks, I appreciate that.

19:36.430 --> 19:37.429
That was quite a nude scene.

19:37.464 --> 19:38.630
I have far too many bullets

19:38.666 --> 19:40.032
in this thing
for you to still be talking.

19:40.067 --> 19:41.933
You, we need to have a
conversation right now.

19:41.969 --> 19:43.402
LUCIFER: That's a waste
of time, Detective.

19:43.437 --> 19:45.304
I've just threatened his life...
he's not our guy.

19:45.339 --> 19:46.605
He would've said, trust me.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.774
You did what?

19:48.809 --> 19:50.909
Yeah, isn't that illegal?

19:50.944 --> 19:52.678
Uh, little bit, yeah.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.046
You stay put.

19:54.081 --> 19:55.247
You, you're coming with me.

19:55.282 --> 19:56.848
What? Ooh.
(laughs)

19:56.884 --> 19:58.583
With pleasure.

19:58.619 --> 20:00.452
At least, perhaps now,
you'll listen to me.

20:00.487 --> 20:02.788
Although, I'm not quite sure
why I'm being arrested.

20:02.823 --> 20:05.223
Because you're interfering
with a police investigation.

20:05.259 --> 20:07.693
You've broken I can't
even count how many laws.

20:07.728 --> 20:08.860
And you pissed me off.

20:08.896 --> 20:10.395
Right, I can get
out of these, you know?

20:10.431 --> 20:11.663
Funny.

20:13.100 --> 20:15.200
How'd you do that?

20:15.235 --> 20:16.501
(sighs)
Come on, we're wasting time.

20:16.537 --> 20:18.303
We should be out there
solving a homicide

20:18.339 --> 20:20.205
and punishing those responsible.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.606
"We"?
You're insane.

20:21.642 --> 20:23.575
I'm taking you in.
Get in the car.

20:23.610 --> 20:24.743
No, that's boring.

20:24.778 --> 20:25.911
Not to mention pointless.

20:25.946 --> 20:28.113
Come on, I'll help you.
It'll be fun.

20:28.148 --> 20:29.748
How could you possibly help me?

20:29.783 --> 20:31.016
I have a certain skill set.

20:31.051 --> 20:33.085
I can be very persuasive
with people

20:33.120 --> 20:35.520
and tend to see things
that others cannot.

20:35.556 --> 20:37.289
So, you're psychic or something?

20:37.324 --> 20:39.758
No, I can't read people's minds.
I'm not a Jedi.

20:39.793 --> 20:41.326
People just like
to tell me things.

20:41.362 --> 20:43.095
Hmm, just-just tell you things?

20:43.130 --> 20:44.763
Just confess their sins,
just like that?

20:44.798 --> 20:45.864
No, not their sins.

20:45.899 --> 20:47.332
I have no power
over people's sins.

20:47.368 --> 20:49.034
I actually get
a bad rap for that.

20:49.069 --> 20:50.235
I have the ability

20:50.270 --> 20:52.771
to draw out people's
forbidden desires.

20:52.806 --> 20:54.072
The more simple the human,

20:54.108 --> 20:55.273
the easier it is.

20:55.309 --> 20:56.675
The more complex,
the more challenging

20:56.710 --> 20:58.176
and exciting, really.

20:58.212 --> 21:00.612
But no, the actual sins,
the sins are on you people.

21:00.647 --> 21:02.114
"You people"?

21:02.850 --> 21:04.149
I got it.

21:04.184 --> 21:05.784
I got it! The name?

21:05.819 --> 21:07.018
The whole Lucifer thing?

21:07.054 --> 21:08.987
And desire's, like,
your superpower.

21:09.022 --> 21:11.423
Mm, it's more like
a gift from God really.

21:11.458 --> 21:13.658
Okay, look.

21:13.694 --> 21:16.094
Tell me, Detective,

21:16.130 --> 21:19.264
what do you desire more than
anything else in this life?

21:19.299 --> 21:22.134
This is it?
This is your big trick?

21:28.108 --> 21:29.708
(sighs)

21:29.743 --> 21:32.010
I guess,
when I was a little girl,

21:32.045 --> 21:35.781
I... always wanted to be a cop
like my daddy,

21:35.816 --> 21:40.018
so that... that one day
I could help people and...

21:40.053 --> 21:42.491
and be taken seriously...

21:42.601 --> 21:46.091
...when I say to shut up
and get in the damn car.

21:50.230 --> 21:52.497
You're not, like, a Jedi
or something, are you?

21:52.533 --> 21:54.599
Get in the car.

21:54.635 --> 21:55.934
No, no, no, no, no.
Look.

21:55.969 --> 21:57.102
I know something you don't know.

21:57.137 --> 21:58.870
Really? What's that?

21:58.906 --> 22:00.472
Won't say unless you
take me with you on this.

22:00.507 --> 22:03.975
Please, come on.
I got to 2Vile, didn't I?

22:04.011 --> 22:05.710
Why do you care
about this so much?

22:05.746 --> 22:06.945
About Delilah?

22:08.849 --> 22:12.117
Look, I just... I just do.

22:12.152 --> 22:13.785
Look, if I hadn't meddled
with her career,

22:13.821 --> 22:16.121
maybe she wouldn't
have died.

22:16.156 --> 22:17.122
Okay.

22:17.157 --> 22:18.657
Okay, fine...
but if this

22:18.692 --> 22:20.625
little clue thing of yours
doesn't pan out,

22:20.661 --> 22:23.028
these are going back on,
and they're gonna stay on.

22:23.063 --> 22:24.765
Is that a promise?

22:33.548 --> 22:35.045
CHLOE: <i>Yeah, therapist
in Beverly Hills</i>

22:35.080 --> 22:36.213
<i>with the first name Linda.</i>

22:36.248 --> 22:37.681
See if Delilah
was a client.

22:37.716 --> 22:38.982
Ah-ah, actually,
she had a pseudonym,

22:39.017 --> 22:40.217
which I also
happen to know.

22:40.252 --> 22:41.651
I'm quite good
at this, aren't I?

22:41.687 --> 22:44.421
- Uh, Penny Lane.
- Okay.

22:44.456 --> 22:46.656
Delilah may have gone
by Penny Lane. Thanks.

22:49.765 --> 22:51.161
Don't look so smug.

22:51.196 --> 22:52.195
Nothing's
panned out yet.

22:52.231 --> 22:53.430
No, no, no, it's not that.

22:53.465 --> 22:55.131
It's just that I knew
that I recognized you.

22:55.167 --> 22:56.800
Right.

22:56.835 --> 22:58.468
Right, you've seen my boobies.

22:58.503 --> 22:59.436
It's exciting.

22:59.471 --> 23:00.503
What, are you 12?

23:00.539 --> 23:01.638
So is the, uh... is the movie

23:01.673 --> 23:03.440
why you've got such
a chip on your shoulder?

23:04.676 --> 23:05.909
Uh, it's low on the list

23:05.944 --> 23:07.844
- of things I have to live down, I guess.
- Right.

23:07.879 --> 23:10.146
Attractive female cop
struggling to be taken seriously

23:10.182 --> 23:11.815
in a man's man's world...
that it?

23:11.850 --> 23:14.484
Yeah, something like that.

23:14.519 --> 23:15.819
Well, they're
threatened.

23:15.854 --> 23:18.755
You're clearly smart
and have notable instincts.

23:18.790 --> 23:20.819
Ignore them. Trust yourself.

23:21.526 --> 23:22.826
(cell phone rings)

23:22.861 --> 23:25.495
Detective Decker.

23:25.530 --> 23:26.796
All right,
text it to me.

23:26.832 --> 23:28.331
Thanks.

23:28.367 --> 23:29.899
What's that?

23:29.935 --> 23:30.965
(sighs)

23:31.000 --> 23:32.869
What you were
saying stands up.

23:32.904 --> 23:34.170
There's a Penny
Lane who sees

23:34.206 --> 23:35.905
a Dr. Linda Martin
in Beverly Hills.

23:35.941 --> 23:38.141
Excellent.
I'll clear my schedule.

23:38.176 --> 23:39.337
(cell phone rings)

23:39.372 --> 23:40.477
Ooh, someone's popular.

23:40.512 --> 23:41.511
Please stop talking.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.313
Hello.

23:43.348 --> 23:45.412
What? You're kidding me.
Is she okay?

23:46.518 --> 23:48.385
Oh, of course he's not there.

23:48.420 --> 23:49.719
Thanks.

23:49.755 --> 23:51.755
We got to make
a pit stop.

23:51.790 --> 23:52.856
What?
No, absolutely not.

23:52.891 --> 23:55.325
My kid got into a fight.
I got to pick her up.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.027
What, can't she get
herself home?

23:57.062 --> 23:58.361
She's seven.

23:58.397 --> 23:59.863
Look, I'm not here
to help you run errands.

23:59.898 --> 24:01.364
I'm here to help you
solve a homicide.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.166
Really?

24:05.270 --> 24:08.204
("Sinister Kid"
by the Black Keys playing)

24:14.346 --> 24:15.512
CHLOE:
<i>All right.</i>

24:15.547 --> 24:17.080
Wait here.

24:17.115 --> 24:18.381

24:58.924 --> 25:01.324
Oh, dear, what will
become of me?

25:01.360 --> 25:03.393
My mother is
a police officer.

25:03.428 --> 25:05.128
She could arrest you.

25:05.163 --> 25:06.156
(lighter snaps shut)

25:06.191 --> 25:09.328
Oh, I think I might
know your mother.

25:09.363 --> 25:10.433
What's your name?

25:10.469 --> 25:12.135
Lucifer.

25:12.170 --> 25:13.937
(whispering):
Like the Devil?

25:13.972 --> 25:15.705
Exactly.

25:15.741 --> 25:19.642
My name's Beatrice, but
everybody calls me Trixie.

25:19.678 --> 25:21.644
That's a hooker's name.

25:21.680 --> 25:22.979
What's a hooker?

25:23.014 --> 25:24.948
Ask your mother.

25:24.983 --> 25:27.951
So... why are you
in trouble?

25:27.986 --> 25:30.120
See that girl
over there?

25:30.894 --> 25:32.722
She was bullying me.

25:32.758 --> 25:34.391
She created a fake
Snapchat account

25:34.426 --> 25:36.025
and used it to
make fun of me.

25:36.061 --> 25:40.663
So... I kicked her in the
no-no-touch-touch square.

25:42.134 --> 25:44.134
Oh. Oh, I see.

25:44.169 --> 25:47.036
Well played.

25:47.072 --> 25:48.505
Well played, indeed.

25:51.710 --> 25:53.449
Hello, mean girl.

25:54.579 --> 25:56.946
Did you know there's a
special section of Hell

25:56.982 --> 25:58.081
reserved for bullies?

25:58.116 --> 26:00.450
So have fun.

26:02.059 --> 26:03.492
(screams)

26:06.825 --> 26:07.991
What did you do?

26:08.026 --> 26:09.959
Oh...

26:09.995 --> 26:12.896
I just think someone's feeling
a little guilty.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.691
(school bell rings)

26:21.239 --> 26:22.672
Hi, Daddy.

26:22.707 --> 26:24.007
Hi, munchkin.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.175
CHLOE: Wow, shocker,
you're late.

26:25.210 --> 26:26.342
Come on, give
me a break.

26:26.378 --> 26:27.644
I'm putting
a case to bed.

26:27.679 --> 26:29.145
Right, like I'm not
working a case, too.

26:29.181 --> 26:31.781
Oh, yeah, the one
you tried to steal from me.

26:31.817 --> 26:33.216
You mean the open and shut one.

26:33.251 --> 26:36.252
You did open and shut it, right?

26:36.288 --> 26:38.121
I'm being diligent, Dan.
It's a high-profile case.

26:38.156 --> 26:39.956
Exactly, which is why you
need to be smart about it.

26:39.991 --> 26:41.891
She is smart.
You're the dimwit.

26:41.927 --> 26:44.961
Perhaps you should refrain from
arguing in front of the child.

26:44.996 --> 26:46.129
It's unbecoming.

26:47.432 --> 26:49.499
I don't know whether to laugh
or to shoot you.

26:49.534 --> 26:51.434
Surprise me.

26:51.470 --> 26:53.058
Isn't he funny, Daddy?

26:53.677 --> 26:55.538
CHLOE: Hey, can you, uh,
drop Trix at my mom's?

26:55.574 --> 26:57.040
We got to go. Thank you.

26:57.075 --> 26:59.142
Trixella, give
Mommy a kiss.

26:59.177 --> 27:01.044
I love you so much.

27:01.079 --> 27:02.779
Good job standing up
to the mean girl.

27:02.814 --> 27:04.147
Thanks, Mommy.

27:04.182 --> 27:06.082
What's a hooker?

27:09.287 --> 27:11.354
Daddy will tell you.

27:15.494 --> 27:16.759
Bye, Lucifer.

27:16.795 --> 27:18.261
It was nice meeting you.

27:19.397 --> 27:20.897
CHLOE:
Hmm.

27:20.932 --> 27:22.232
Think she likes you.

27:22.267 --> 27:24.909
Of course she does...
what's not to like?

27:36.661 --> 27:39.128
Was your offspring
planned or a mistake?

27:40.798 --> 27:42.131
Planned, sort of.

27:42.166 --> 27:43.566
Really?

27:43.601 --> 27:45.234
'Cause I've never understood
the human desire to procreate.

27:45.270 --> 27:47.036
That's probably
a good thing.

27:47.071 --> 27:48.771
I mean, children are
hideous little creatures,

27:48.806 --> 27:50.139
terrible, taxing burdens.

27:50.174 --> 27:52.241
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

27:52.277 --> 27:53.976
Oh, um, yours is fine.

27:54.012 --> 27:56.379
I mean, you know,
nothing to crow about,

27:56.414 --> 27:57.913
but nothing to be too
embarrassed about, either,

27:57.949 --> 27:59.048
so that's quite good, isn't it?

27:59.083 --> 28:02.018
Are you at all aware
of how dickish you sound?

28:02.053 --> 28:03.185
No.

28:04.289 --> 28:07.356
Speaking of dicks...

28:07.392 --> 28:08.824
why was that ex-husband of yours

28:08.860 --> 28:10.845
pressuring you
to close the case?

28:11.817 --> 28:13.417
No reason.

28:14.999 --> 28:16.266
Strange.

28:16.301 --> 28:18.445
Yes, you are.

28:19.292 --> 28:21.104
Did my father send you?

28:21.139 --> 28:22.538
(door opens)

28:22.573 --> 28:25.274
Okay, Detectives,
I'll see you now.

28:25.310 --> 28:26.709
CHLOE:
Thank you.

28:26.744 --> 28:28.244
Oh. "Detectives."

28:29.614 --> 28:31.247
CHLOE: Dr. Martin,
I'd like to ask you

28:31.282 --> 28:33.082
a few questions
about Delilah.

28:37.689 --> 28:40.189
You're thinking
about it, aren't you?

28:40.224 --> 28:41.357
What?

28:41.392 --> 28:42.558
Yes, I wouldn't
recommend it.

28:42.593 --> 28:43.859
I'm like walking heroin.

28:43.895 --> 28:45.861
Very habit-forming.
It never ends well.

28:45.897 --> 28:46.962
(sighs)

28:46.998 --> 28:49.598
I'm sorry, do... do you two
know each other?

28:49.634 --> 28:51.267
No, no, but I know that look.

28:51.302 --> 28:54.203
I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:55.139 --> 28:56.472
That is interesting

28:56.507 --> 28:59.208
'cause... you don't
look at me that way.

28:59.243 --> 29:01.243
- What way?
- With carnal fascination.

29:01.279 --> 29:02.645
That's 'cause
it doesn't exist.

29:02.680 --> 29:04.847
No, you see, that's just it...
with most women, it does.

29:04.882 --> 29:06.649
I tend to appeal to the
dark, mischievous hearts

29:06.684 --> 29:09.885
in all of you, but
you, Detective,

29:09.921 --> 29:12.054
you seem oddly
immune to my charms.

29:12.090 --> 29:15.091
Referring to them as "charms,"
I think, is a bit of a stretch.

29:15.126 --> 29:16.726
Truth be told,
I find you repulsive.

29:16.761 --> 29:18.427
Like, on a
chemical level.

29:18.463 --> 29:19.628
That's fascinating.

29:20.912 --> 29:22.398
LUCIFER:
Now, tell me, Linda...

29:22.433 --> 29:23.999
You say it's fascinating,

29:24.035 --> 29:27.069
and yet I can see that it
disturbs you, doesn't it?

29:27.105 --> 29:29.538
Deeply.

29:29.574 --> 29:31.140
CHLOE:
Dr. Martin,

29:31.175 --> 29:33.476
we know that, um, Delilah was
having a clandestine affair

29:33.511 --> 29:35.311
with a wealthy married man,
so if you just

29:35.346 --> 29:37.413
tell us his name,
we will be on our way.

29:37.448 --> 29:39.315
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

29:39.350 --> 29:41.083
Oh, she's one of
the complex ones.

29:41.119 --> 29:42.318
Linda,

29:42.353 --> 29:44.920
darling, why don't
you tell me? Hmm?

29:44.956 --> 29:46.078
Well, I can't.

29:46.113 --> 29:47.123
(Lucifer chuckles)

29:47.158 --> 29:49.558
I want to, but I can't.

29:49.594 --> 29:50.659
(laughs)

29:50.695 --> 29:52.995
(laughing):
Oh, you're the devil.

29:53.030 --> 29:55.297
(chuckles)
Correct.

29:55.333 --> 29:56.966
Now, come on, Dr. Martin.

29:57.001 --> 29:58.334
I know you want to.

29:58.369 --> 30:01.604
Oh, man, and it's really,
really juicy, too.

30:01.639 --> 30:02.772
Ooh, I bet it is.

30:02.807 --> 30:04.073
No, I can't.

30:04.108 --> 30:05.408
What did you do to her?

30:05.443 --> 30:06.375
Did you roofie her?

30:06.411 --> 30:07.410
Oh, no, it's
not her fault.

30:07.445 --> 30:08.778
She's just
reacting to me.

30:08.813 --> 30:11.147
Just watch
and learn, okay?

30:11.182 --> 30:12.415
Right, the answer is yes,

30:12.450 --> 30:14.784
we can take a trip
to pound town if we must,

30:14.819 --> 30:18.754
but first, you're gonna have
to tell us, Linda, okay?

30:18.790 --> 30:20.456
(moaning):
Um...

30:20.491 --> 30:23.025
(chuckles)

30:23.060 --> 30:27.623
Okay... (chuckles)
it's Grey Cooper.

30:27.658 --> 30:28.765
Grey Cooper?

30:28.800 --> 30:29.732
Seriously?

30:29.767 --> 30:31.200
That is juicy.

30:31.235 --> 30:32.468
Grey Cooper, the actor?

30:32.503 --> 30:34.069
The one who's married
to Amanda what's-her-chops?

30:34.105 --> 30:35.404
Yeah, yeah.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.206
Oh, no,
he's horrible.

30:37.241 --> 30:40.761
So square-jawed,
so handsome, so vanilla.

30:40.796 --> 30:42.478
Oh, I'm really quite
disappointed in Delilah.

30:42.513 --> 30:46.015
That's truly terrible taste
in the opposite sex.

30:46.050 --> 30:47.450
Thank you very
much, Dr. Martin.

30:47.485 --> 30:48.451
We'll be in touch.

30:48.486 --> 30:49.752
All right,
we got to go.

30:49.787 --> 30:51.353
Yes, of course,
but I... I made a deal,

30:51.389 --> 30:53.289
so I'm gonna have to hold up
my end of the bargain.

30:53.324 --> 30:55.391
You wouldn't mind
waiting outside?

30:55.426 --> 30:56.992
Are you seriously talking

30:57.028 --> 30:58.694
about having sex
with her right now?

30:58.729 --> 31:00.896
- Well, it won't take long.
- I do yoga.

31:01.833 --> 31:05.634
Hot... yoga.

31:05.670 --> 31:08.304
I'm freakishly flexible.

31:08.339 --> 31:09.772
Want to see?

31:12.310 --> 31:13.876
Wow!

31:15.646 --> 31:17.580
(chuckles)

31:17.615 --> 31:20.316
I really tried
to keep that one in.

31:20.351 --> 31:23.018
Well, you tried...
that's what matters.

31:23.054 --> 31:24.453
Uh, look,
I'm really sorry,

31:24.489 --> 31:26.455
but I'm gonna have
to take a rain check.

31:26.491 --> 31:27.590
I will be back, okay?

31:27.625 --> 31:28.824
I certainly hope so.

31:29.727 --> 31:31.994

32:10.434 --> 32:12.434
We need to speak
with Mr. Cooper.

32:14.977 --> 32:18.073
God, Delilah, yeah,
heard about that this morning.

32:18.109 --> 32:19.141
I can't believe it.

32:19.176 --> 32:21.510
We did a movie
together last year.

32:21.546 --> 32:22.545
Got pretty close.

32:22.580 --> 32:24.680
- Lovers?
- Friends.

32:24.715 --> 32:26.248
Friends who were lovers?

32:26.284 --> 32:27.383
CHLOE:
Settle down.

32:27.418 --> 32:28.684
I'll handle
the questions.

32:28.719 --> 32:30.619
Mr. Cooper, when did you last
have contact with Delilah?

32:30.655 --> 32:32.154
Well, actually, I just
have one more question

32:32.189 --> 32:33.756
before you proceed
with the boring ones.

32:33.791 --> 32:36.358
Tell me, Mr. Cooper,

32:36.394 --> 32:38.627
what do you want more
than anything in this world?

32:38.663 --> 32:40.663
What's your deepest,
darkest desire?

32:40.698 --> 32:43.933
You close your eyes,
what do you see?

32:43.968 --> 32:48.470
I'm the president of the
United States of America.

32:48.506 --> 32:49.705
Ha!

32:50.863 --> 32:52.808
Well, who's the Devil now, eh?

32:52.843 --> 32:54.777
Those are some pretty big
aspirations there,

32:54.812 --> 32:57.279
- Mr. Cooper.
- (chuckles) Well, after the acting

32:57.315 --> 32:59.148
- and stuff.
- No need

32:59.183 --> 33:01.550
to be embarrassed. Hell,
if Arnold can do it, right?

33:01.586 --> 33:02.572
- (chuckles)
- Now, you wouldn't

33:02.607 --> 33:03.486
want any nasty secrets

33:03.521 --> 33:05.054
screwing that up for you,
though, would you?

33:05.089 --> 33:06.622
Is there a point to this?

33:06.657 --> 33:09.024
Mr. Cooper, were you having
an affair with Delilah?

33:09.060 --> 33:10.059
AMANDA:
Honey!

33:10.094 --> 33:11.560
Have you been
getting my texts?

33:11.596 --> 33:12.962
I thought they were
breaking you for lunch

33:12.997 --> 33:14.563
like a half hour ago.

33:15.466 --> 33:16.465
What's going on?

33:16.500 --> 33:18.968
These people are detectives.

33:19.003 --> 33:19.969
Real ones?

33:20.004 --> 33:22.071
We have some questions
about Delilah.

33:22.106 --> 33:24.173
Oh. Oh. Yes, it's so sad.

33:24.208 --> 33:26.343
Yeah. Very sad.

33:26.644 --> 33:28.547
Your watch,
where'd you get that?

33:28.846 --> 33:30.312
Oh, it's a prop.

33:30.348 --> 33:31.347
AMANDA:
No, that's the one

33:31.382 --> 33:32.314
Delilah gave you, isn't it?

33:32.350 --> 33:33.682
For <i> Time Will Tell?</i>

33:33.718 --> 33:36.118
GREY: Right.
That's the movie

33:36.153 --> 33:38.387
that we did.
It was a wrap gift.

33:38.422 --> 33:40.723
(chuckles)
Yeah. She buy a $10,000 watch

33:40.758 --> 33:42.291
- for the whole crew?
- Uh, no.

33:42.326 --> 33:44.493
Just me, as far as I know.

33:44.528 --> 33:46.829
'Cause we were,
you know,

33:46.864 --> 33:48.430
costars and everything.

33:48.466 --> 33:50.766
You know, you're gonna have
to get much better at lying

33:50.801 --> 33:52.134
if you want to be president.

33:52.169 --> 33:54.370
I know, right?

33:54.405 --> 33:56.952
So you were sleeping
with her, then, yeah?

33:57.545 --> 34:00.494
- Oh, yeah. (chuckles)
- (laughing)

34:05.316 --> 34:07.116
Crap. I just said that
in front of people.

34:07.151 --> 34:08.717
Whatever.
It's not like I didn't know.

34:08.753 --> 34:10.485
God, you are a
terrible liar.

34:10.521 --> 34:11.754
And actor, by the way.

34:11.789 --> 34:13.121
- You knew?
- Of course.

34:13.157 --> 34:16.659
Why else do you think I've been
sleeping with Bobby?

34:16.694 --> 34:17.826
Are you serious?

34:17.862 --> 34:19.762
Oh, yeah. And it is good.

34:19.797 --> 34:22.331
Mmm. I climb that man
like a tree.

34:22.366 --> 34:23.297
Right, Bobby?

34:23.333 --> 34:25.034
GREY:
My bodyguard?

34:25.069 --> 34:26.902
What a cliché.

34:26.937 --> 34:29.004
Oh, I'm a cliché?
Well, you're a dick.

34:29.040 --> 34:30.172
Oh, boy.

34:31.542 --> 34:33.242
- Hey, guys...
- Come on!

34:33.277 --> 34:35.777
Hey, guys. Arrest them.

34:35.813 --> 34:38.047
- Seriously?
- (grunting)

35:05.430 --> 35:07.063
That can't be a coincidence.

35:07.098 --> 35:11.768
Maybe Delilah gave him one, too,
like kind of a go-to gift. I...

35:11.803 --> 35:13.236
Well, that would imply
she was actually

35:13.271 --> 35:14.337

That's three other maggots

Yeah. I suppose you got a point.

35:35.393 --> 35:37.160
You tell me, Detective.

35:37.195 --> 35:39.529
I mean, despite
your proclaimed revulsion,

35:39.564 --> 35:42.131
you can't deny that
there's a connection between us.

35:42.167 --> 35:45.201
Tell me, what do
you actually want?

35:45.236 --> 35:48.204
You mean what do I desire
more than anything else

35:48.239 --> 35:49.572
- in this life?
- Yes.

35:56.948 --> 35:58.448
I don't know.

35:58.483 --> 36:00.149
What-what I told you's true.

36:00.185 --> 36:03.286
I-I really do want
to help people.

36:04.189 --> 36:05.822
My father was a cop.

36:05.857 --> 36:07.356
He was a great cop.

36:07.392 --> 36:09.125
My mother was an actress.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.626
Really cheesy one.
(chuckles)

36:10.662 --> 36:13.830
I tried the acting thing.
I took off my top.

36:13.865 --> 36:16.365
Wasn't really contributing
to the betterment of society.

36:16.401 --> 36:18.501
I disagree. I love that movie.

36:18.536 --> 36:19.769
(chuckles)

36:19.804 --> 36:20.837
So I quit.

36:20.872 --> 36:22.538
Decided to become a cop
like my dad

36:22.574 --> 36:25.208
and, uh, dealt with the whole
<i>Hot Tub High School</i> thing,

36:25.243 --> 36:26.876
until, um,

36:26.911 --> 36:29.078
I became a detective
and found a whole new way

36:29.113 --> 36:31.447
- to ostracize myself.
- Ah, the...

36:31.483 --> 36:33.950
reason your ex-maggot
was pressuring you

36:33.985 --> 36:35.585
to close this?

36:35.620 --> 36:37.153
Yeah. Yeah.

36:37.188 --> 36:39.355
Exactly. There was a case,

36:39.390 --> 36:42.191
a shooting on Palmetto Street
where a cop was shot,

36:42.227 --> 36:44.460
and I saw it differently
than pretty much everyone

36:44.496 --> 36:46.596
in my department,
including my ex.

36:46.631 --> 36:48.297
And I stuck
my neck out,

36:48.333 --> 36:50.399
and it backfired.

36:50.435 --> 36:52.468
And, uh, now...

36:52.504 --> 36:55.204
(chuckles)
no one wants to work with me.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.206
Well, I'm available.

36:58.681 --> 37:00.409
Too bad your little protégé

37:00.445 --> 37:01.744
isn't around
to collect the check.

37:01.779 --> 37:03.045
REPORTER:
The soundtrack album

37:03.081 --> 37:04.347
for the movie <i> Time Will Tell</i>

37:04.382 --> 37:07.083
has reached number 15
on the Billboard charts

37:07.118 --> 37:08.851
and is still climbing.
Song and record sales...

37:08.887 --> 37:10.219
Oh, wow.

37:11.222 --> 37:12.688
What?

37:14.025 --> 37:16.726
Delilah didn't give that watch
to the drug dealer.

37:21.649 --> 37:24.133
♪ Got a heavy load,
sometimes I wonder... ♪

37:24.169 --> 37:25.160
- Stop, stop, stop!
- (music stops)

37:25.195 --> 37:28.052
What is it? You got a gerbil in
your throat? What's going on?

37:29.941 --> 37:31.107
Hello, Jimmy.

37:31.142 --> 37:32.842
Really?

37:32.877 --> 37:34.477
How's the album sales doing?

37:34.512 --> 37:35.811
What album?

37:35.847 --> 37:38.114
Soundtrack to <i> Time Will Tell,</i>
which you produced.

37:38.149 --> 37:41.584
Whitney Houston hit the top ten
for album sales after her death.

37:41.619 --> 37:43.553
Michael Jackson hit
the stratosphere.

37:43.588 --> 37:46.556
Not sure you'll achieve such
heights having Delilah killed,

37:46.591 --> 37:49.792
but that sure is a boatload of
royalty checks headed your way.

37:49.827 --> 37:53.296
Guess you really
needed the cash, huh?

37:53.331 --> 37:56.566
Which is why you had to pay
the shooter with your watch.

37:56.601 --> 37:58.868
The watch Delilah gave you.
Now, that's just sick.

37:58.903 --> 38:00.636
But then you are, so...

38:02.040 --> 38:03.562
(gun clicks)

38:03.597 --> 38:04.807
Hey, Jimmy?

38:04.842 --> 38:06.309
I made her,
and she ruined me.

38:06.344 --> 38:09.278
She humiliated me.
She owes me.

38:09.314 --> 38:11.809
You're not God, Jimmy.
You didn't make her.

38:12.076 --> 38:13.482
But you did destroy her.

38:13.518 --> 38:15.384
So I'm gonna punish you.

38:15.420 --> 38:18.054
You back off,
you freak. I mean it.

38:18.089 --> 38:20.323
I am not going to jail
for that bitch. No chance.

38:20.358 --> 38:21.691
Listen to him,
Lucifer. Back off.

38:21.726 --> 38:23.759
I told you, it's fine.
I'm immortal.

38:26.364 --> 38:28.664
Why did you do that?

38:28.700 --> 38:30.733
- He was gonna kill you.
- No, no, no,

38:30.768 --> 38:33.669
no, no, no. You just...
you just let him off too easy.

38:33.705 --> 38:35.738
He needs to pay!
He needs to suffer!

38:35.773 --> 38:37.373
He needs to feel the pain,

38:37.408 --> 38:39.842
- not escape it!
- Don't worry.

38:39.877 --> 38:42.244
I'm sure where he's going,
the pain's coming.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.080
No. No, it's not, actually.

38:44.115 --> 38:46.215
And you know why?
Because I'm here and he's...

38:46.250 --> 38:48.451
- (gunshots)
- (gasps)

38:53.391 --> 38:54.890

38:54.926 --> 38:57.593
Chloe.

38:57.629 --> 38:58.861
(gasping)

38:58.896 --> 39:01.631
(weakly):
I don't want to die.

39:01.666 --> 39:04.367
I won't let you.

39:05.803 --> 39:08.510
Your father will just have
to wait for you.

39:09.240 --> 39:11.741
- (gunshots)
- (groaning)

39:13.285 --> 39:16.345
Just... give me one second.

39:16.381 --> 39:19.215
(gunshots)

39:22.286 --> 39:23.386
(grunts)

39:23.421 --> 39:24.620
JIMMY:
No, please! No, no,

39:24.656 --> 39:26.756
please! Please.

39:26.791 --> 39:29.225
Please don't kill me.

39:29.260 --> 39:30.559
Oh, Jimmy.

39:32.563 --> 39:34.263
You're gonna wish
that's all

39:34.298 --> 39:36.999
- I did to you.

39:51.516 --> 39:52.882
LUCIFER:
Well,

39:52.917 --> 39:55.685
look who's back.

39:57.989 --> 39:59.789
(groans)

40:02.160 --> 40:04.393
How long have I been out?

40:04.429 --> 40:07.396
(sighs)
Three years.

40:08.299 --> 40:09.598
What?

40:09.634 --> 40:10.866
(chuckling)

40:12.770 --> 40:14.370
You're such an ass.

40:14.405 --> 40:16.539
- Thank you.
- Oh, God.

40:19.847 --> 40:21.963
He was firing at you.

40:22.373 --> 40:24.059
Why aren't you...

40:24.182 --> 40:26.041
more dead?

40:26.076 --> 40:28.384
You're having a very hard time
with the immortal thing,

40:28.419 --> 40:30.519
aren't you?

40:30.555 --> 40:32.088
(sighs)

40:33.391 --> 40:35.491
- What happened with Jimmy?
- Jimmy?

40:35.526 --> 40:37.960
Jimmy got what he deserved.

40:37.995 --> 40:39.895
Hmm?

40:41.199 --> 40:43.666
Well, I'm pretty sure
I'd be dead

40:43.701 --> 40:45.201
if you hadn't helped me,
so...

40:45.236 --> 40:47.336
thank you.

40:47.371 --> 40:49.271
Sorry, what was that?
That last bit.

40:49.307 --> 40:51.373
I didn't quite
get that.

40:52.243 --> 40:54.143
Thank you.

40:55.079 --> 40:57.179
You're welcome.

40:57.215 --> 40:58.981
And, besides, you know,

40:59.016 --> 41:02.182
you're far too interesting
to let die.

41:02.520 --> 41:04.754
You saved my life
because I'm interesting?

41:04.789 --> 41:06.889
Wildly irritating as well,
but yes.

41:06.924 --> 41:08.124
(chuckles softly)

41:10.428 --> 41:11.594
So what now?

41:11.629 --> 41:13.195
Well, I mean,
I've obviously proven myself

41:13.231 --> 41:14.597
to be an invaluable
crime-fighting tool.

41:14.632 --> 41:17.032
You're a pariah
in the department.

41:17.068 --> 41:18.200
I think this could be the start

41:18.236 --> 41:19.335
of a beautiful friendship.
Don't you?

41:19.370 --> 41:21.470
Who the hell are you?

41:21.506 --> 41:23.739

41:28.613 --> 41:30.613
Um, just... Why don't you save

41:30.648 --> 41:32.448
some of this unpleasantness
for your mother, yeah?

41:33.751 --> 41:35.718
- Sorry.
- Oh.

- God.
- Are you hurt?

41:37.922 --> 41:39.121
I'm okay.

41:39.157 --> 41:40.823
LUCIFER: Right.
Well, I'd stay for

41:40.858 --> 41:42.958
the family reunion,
but it's giving me terrible IBS.

41:42.994 --> 41:45.528
So, look forward
to seeing you soon, Chloe.

41:45.563 --> 41:47.530

I strongly suggest you do
what I told you to do

42:28.339 --> 42:29.738
