WEBVTT

00:03.068 --> 00:04.172
- Adrenaline...

00:06.137 --> 00:07.068
Money...

00:07.137 --> 00:08.275
- I am Derek Roman.

00:08.344 --> 00:09.724
I need to choke
on the dollar signs.

00:09.793 --> 00:11.172
- Power...

00:11.241 --> 00:12.896
- The last person I fired
wound up in a ditch,

00:12.965 --> 00:14.206
so good luck to you.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.034
- Mr. Roman,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.965
- I'm accepting the EVP job.

00:18.034 --> 00:18.965
- Sex...

00:23.103 --> 00:24.655
On this court,

00:24.724 --> 00:26.344
you can have it all.

00:26.413 --> 00:28.034
The feeling is indescribable.

00:28.103 --> 00:30.862
- I put my agents on sniffing
around for a new deal,

00:30.931 --> 00:32.034
the Miami bid.

00:32.103 --> 00:33.482
- I'm the owner of the team.

00:33.551 --> 00:35.586
And right now,
you are the team.

00:37.379 --> 00:39.379
- Winning a spot
on this floor is hard.

00:39.448 --> 00:41.724
- I'm terrified of being alone.

00:41.793 --> 00:44.000
I can maybe take you in
for a little bit.

00:45.206 --> 00:46.310
- We've come a long way.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.310
- Keeping it? Well,

00:48.379 --> 00:49.655
that's a whole lot harder.

00:49.724 --> 00:51.103
- Congratulations, Kyle.

00:51.172 --> 00:52.758
You're the new captain
of the Devil Girls.

00:54.827 --> 00:56.793
Devils Nation...

00:56.862 --> 00:58.310
Rise up.

01:24.310 --> 01:25.931
Hello, bitches.

01:52.034 --> 01:55.034
- I'm sure you have more
important things to do, Jelena,

01:55.103 --> 01:57.000
owning the team and all.

01:57.068 --> 02:00.551
- The Devil Girls are
a direct reflection of me.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.896
That reflection
will be flawless.

02:03.965 --> 02:07.793
Actually, I do
have some work to do.

02:07.862 --> 02:09.413
But I'll be back.

02:09.482 --> 02:11.068
- Lookin' forward.

02:12.689 --> 02:15.310
- Let's go.
- Alisha, you're up, darling.

02:18.379 --> 02:20.103
- Don't talk to him.

02:22.482 --> 02:24.586
You have fun?
- Yeah.

02:24.655 --> 02:26.965
- I'll just take of this
right here, okay?

02:27.034 --> 02:28.517
- Sure.
- All right.

02:29.827 --> 02:31.379
- Kyle Hart!

02:31.448 --> 02:33.103
You went from
headlining the Foxhole

02:33.172 --> 02:34.448
to captain of the Devil Girls!

02:34.517 --> 02:36.586
Your split is my shit.

02:36.655 --> 02:38.413
- What is your name, darling?

02:38.482 --> 02:40.275
- Jamie.
I drove from Chicago

02:40.344 --> 02:41.482
just for these tryouts.

02:41.551 --> 02:43.000
- That's quite the drive.

02:43.068 --> 02:44.413
- I couldn't pass up
the opportunity.

02:44.482 --> 02:46.655
I'm a hustler, just like you.

02:47.896 --> 02:49.482
- And Jelena Howard
and Ahsha Hayes!

02:49.551 --> 02:51.827
With them not on the team
anymore, this is my--

02:51.896 --> 02:53.275
- Next!

03:03.724 --> 03:06.827
- How's Ahsha?
Has she said anything?

03:06.896 --> 03:08.655
- Not a word.

03:10.344 --> 03:11.793
Sloane's with her.

03:11.862 --> 03:15.379
- Yeah, that's more than
I can say for some people.

03:17.275 --> 03:19.689
- She'll talk when she's ready.

03:19.758 --> 03:21.586
- As for Derek...

03:21.655 --> 03:23.413
When I find him, damn sure

03:23.482 --> 03:25.206
I'm gonna get some answers.

03:47.724 --> 03:50.206
- Excuse me, what's the
fastest way to the court?

03:50.275 --> 03:51.965
- That-a-way.
- Oh...

03:52.034 --> 03:53.965
I owe you my life.
- I'll collect it.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.620
- Last season was a disaster.

04:09.689 --> 04:11.551
FEMA showed up
at the All-Star break.

04:11.620 --> 04:14.034
When you lose your A-team,
you're gonna lose,

04:14.103 --> 04:16.068
period.

04:16.137 --> 04:17.896
We had no Derek,

04:17.965 --> 04:19.689
no Zero...

04:22.862 --> 04:24.689
I've still got one
of my A-Team.

04:24.758 --> 04:26.689
My EVP.

04:26.758 --> 04:29.275
You've been impressive
as hell, Jude.

04:29.344 --> 04:32.862
Loyal to the Devils
when others weren't.

04:32.931 --> 04:34.413
- That might be
the first compliment

04:34.482 --> 04:35.793
you've given me
in a year and a half.

04:37.275 --> 04:38.482
That's the only compliment

04:38.551 --> 04:39.655
I've given anyone
in a year and a half.

04:41.896 --> 04:43.655
- We'll get back
to where we were.

04:43.724 --> 04:47.000
- You bet your tight
white ass we will.

04:47.068 --> 04:49.689
- Let's go, Fahey.
I want to see some hustle!

04:49.758 --> 04:53.241
There we go!
That'll do it!

04:53.310 --> 04:55.758
Move, move, move!
- Coach!

04:55.827 --> 04:57.620
I am so, so sorry.

04:57.689 --> 04:59.379
Look, my Maserati
almost exploded

04:59.448 --> 05:01.000
on the 405.
It's new, all right?

05:01.068 --> 05:02.931
It has a seventh gear, and I
didn't even know cars had--

05:03.000 --> 05:05.379
- I'm well-known
for being super forgiving

05:05.448 --> 05:06.793
for rolling in late,

05:06.862 --> 05:08.655
especially when it comes
to rookies

05:08.724 --> 05:11.103
who blow their first paycheck
before they even earn it.

05:15.931 --> 05:17.413
Let's go.

05:17.482 --> 05:18.620
Let's go!

05:20.275 --> 05:22.068
There you go, use the glass!

05:24.758 --> 05:27.551
Anybody wanna tell the rookie
we got a locker room?

05:38.689 --> 05:40.724
- I'm not talking
to reporters right now.

05:40.793 --> 05:43.827
- Honey, do reporters
dress like this?

05:43.896 --> 05:47.000
Just give me five minutes
and I'm gone.

05:47.068 --> 05:49.965
Or I'll come back
every day forever.

05:50.034 --> 05:51.310
Name's Kyle Hart,

05:51.379 --> 05:52.931
captain of the Devil Girls.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.310
I know who you are.

05:54.379 --> 05:56.758
Everyone in America
knows who you are, London.

05:56.827 --> 05:57.862
- Okay, bye.

05:57.931 --> 05:59.413
- Wait!

05:59.482 --> 06:00.758
What I don't know
is why you're still

06:00.827 --> 06:03.172
holed up in your house
months later.

06:03.241 --> 06:04.620
Especially when Pastor Curtis

06:04.689 --> 06:07.103
is out in public
with his famous friends.

06:07.172 --> 06:09.172
And his wife.

06:11.689 --> 06:13.482
- Because he wasn't
the one dragged

06:13.551 --> 06:14.655
by every late night host

06:14.724 --> 06:16.379
and gossip rag in the country!

06:16.448 --> 06:18.103
I was humiliated!

06:18.172 --> 06:19.206
I had a career!

06:19.275 --> 06:21.379
And now, I'm just a whore

06:21.448 --> 06:23.448
that took down a mega-church.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.413
"The Home Wrecker
in the House of God."

06:25.482 --> 06:26.724
- One more sex scandal

06:26.793 --> 06:29.206
where it's the woman
who's crucified.

06:29.275 --> 06:31.310
- It wasn't sex.

06:31.379 --> 06:33.517
I loved him!

06:33.586 --> 06:35.724
- You were the best
choreographer working.

06:35.793 --> 06:37.241
That's what you were
famous for first.

06:37.310 --> 06:38.448
That's who I came to see.

06:38.517 --> 06:39.551
We're having tryouts.

06:39.620 --> 06:41.172
I want you in them.

06:41.241 --> 06:45.206
- So you want me to audition
for the Devil Girls?

06:46.724 --> 06:48.448
Captains don't usually
go out and recruit,

06:48.517 --> 06:51.965
but I'm not
your typical captain.

06:52.034 --> 06:54.655
I want the best,
and you're the best.

06:54.724 --> 06:55.758
- Look, I'm not looking to put

06:55.827 --> 06:57.103
myself back in the spotlight.

06:58.551 --> 07:00.275
Shame is overrated.

07:00.344 --> 07:02.413
Think about it.

07:02.482 --> 07:04.862
Tryouts are at Devils Arena.

07:04.931 --> 07:07.034
If anyone gives you any crap,

07:07.103 --> 07:09.275
you send them to me.

07:47.689 --> 07:49.965
- I heard you were in town.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.517
- I don't blame you
for being anywhere but Miami.

08:01.586 --> 08:02.724
Considering how
you finished your season there,

08:02.793 --> 08:03.862
you might not be too popular

08:03.931 --> 08:06.206
with your teammates right now.

08:06.275 --> 08:08.379
To dominate so completely

08:08.448 --> 08:10.344
all season...

08:10.413 --> 08:12.000
And then go so wildly

08:12.068 --> 08:14.241
off the rails in post...

08:14.310 --> 08:16.137
Showing up at all the parties

08:16.206 --> 08:19.137
at the clubs till 3:00 a.m.

08:19.206 --> 08:22.172
Or are they not the ones
you're hiding from?

08:25.655 --> 08:27.344
Where is your wife?

08:29.344 --> 08:30.793
- You want one?

08:30.862 --> 08:32.310
- It's 9:00 in the morning.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.620
- I'll put
cream and sugar in it.

08:34.689 --> 08:36.206
- If I know you're here,

08:36.275 --> 08:38.517
it can't be too long
before Ahsha shows up.

08:40.103 --> 08:42.482
She could be
on her way here right now.

08:42.551 --> 08:45.620
- Don't count on it.

08:54.724 --> 08:56.965
- What happened to you?

09:00.931 --> 09:02.793
Well...

09:02.862 --> 09:04.862
The new season
is about to start.

09:04.931 --> 09:06.758
You're going to have to
go back to Miami,

09:06.827 --> 09:09.310
and face everyone eventually.

09:09.379 --> 09:10.793
You're fast on the court

09:10.862 --> 09:14.241
but even you can't outrun this.

09:20.068 --> 09:22.000
- No, just make sure
it's within the bounds

09:22.068 --> 09:24.310
of what we're
doing here, okay?

09:24.379 --> 09:25.551
- Commissioner Matthews.

09:25.620 --> 09:26.689
My name is Eve.

09:26.758 --> 09:28.000
I want to talk to you about

09:28.068 --> 09:29.793
the liaison position
in your office.

09:29.862 --> 09:31.241
- I've done my interviews.

09:31.310 --> 09:33.068
- You haven't,

09:33.137 --> 09:35.551
because you
haven't interviewed me yet.

09:40.655 --> 09:44.068
- Let's see.

09:44.137 --> 09:46.068
Choate...

09:46.137 --> 09:48.482
Wharton...

09:48.551 --> 09:49.896
Your resume
is better than mine,

09:49.965 --> 09:52.172
and I run
the whole damn league.

09:52.241 --> 09:53.448
Um...

09:53.517 --> 09:56.172
Wait a minute.

09:56.241 --> 09:58.000
Is that true?

09:58.068 --> 09:59.827
- Eve Vincent.

09:59.896 --> 10:01.551
I'm Olivia and Chase's
daughter.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.517
It doesn't matter
what's on there.

10:06.586 --> 10:08.896
My resume's missing one thing,

10:08.965 --> 10:11.000
and that's working for you,

10:11.068 --> 10:12.793
the Warren Matthews.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.275
- And you know about my ego.

10:15.344 --> 10:17.034
You do your research.

10:17.103 --> 10:20.517
- The person who's going to
be your liaison with the teams

10:20.586 --> 10:21.862
needs to know each and every

10:21.931 --> 10:23.793
personality
they're dealing with.

10:23.862 --> 10:25.931
And if you want something,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.241
knows how you're gonna get it

10:28.310 --> 10:30.620
before walking into the room.

10:30.689 --> 10:33.448
- You're just like your mother.

10:33.517 --> 10:34.655
- So I have the job?

10:37.379 --> 10:38.482
- You have the interview.

10:41.068 --> 10:42.862
- What do you think?

10:42.931 --> 10:45.482
- The booth needs
more soundproofing.

10:45.551 --> 10:47.620
If I hear her mouth,
I'm boarding the doors

10:47.689 --> 10:49.517
with her inside.

10:52.310 --> 10:54.241
Now.

10:55.517 --> 10:57.517
- Bitch.
- Hag.

10:58.827 --> 11:02.034
- I love this color on you.

11:02.103 --> 11:04.344
- You know, I wish you wouldn't
poke the dragon.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.310
- That was flirtation.

11:06.379 --> 11:07.482
Besides, Jelena's not going to

11:07.551 --> 11:09.103
raise one of her
little elfin hands

11:09.172 --> 11:11.724
to the owner of the network
that carries her games.

11:13.931 --> 11:15.413
- That divorce settlement

11:15.482 --> 11:17.103
was quite the pinata for you.

11:17.172 --> 11:19.482
- It was!

11:19.551 --> 11:20.931
One whack at your dad,

11:21.000 --> 11:22.724
and all these fun
trinkets fell out,

11:22.793 --> 11:24.620
but I earned
Inside Sports Network.

11:24.689 --> 11:26.482
- Your love of sports
is legendary.

11:26.551 --> 11:27.758
- I love ratings

11:27.827 --> 11:29.586
and swinging a big purse.

11:29.655 --> 11:31.344
- Well, thank you

11:31.413 --> 11:32.517
for swinging us airtime

11:32.586 --> 11:34.275
to debut the new Devil Girls.

11:34.344 --> 11:35.517
Going live worldwide

11:35.586 --> 11:37.413
for the first dance
is gonna be huge.

11:37.482 --> 11:39.551
- I'd do anything for you.

11:39.620 --> 11:41.241
You're my guy.

11:41.310 --> 11:42.517
- So giving you this on-site

11:42.586 --> 11:43.931
broadcast booth in exchange

11:44.000 --> 11:45.827
wasn't necessary?
- No.

11:45.896 --> 11:48.103
It was very necessary.

11:49.379 --> 11:50.793
How are you?

11:52.793 --> 11:55.517
Jude, you need to shake
yourself out of it.

11:57.482 --> 11:59.448
- I don't know how.

11:59.517 --> 12:00.965
- Okay, fine.

12:01.034 --> 12:02.724
I'll shake you out of it.

12:35.034 --> 12:36.275
- Yes!

12:36.344 --> 12:37.551
Go Jamie!

12:37.620 --> 12:38.931
Go girl!

12:45.758 --> 12:48.034
- It's London Scott.

12:48.103 --> 12:49.620
- Put your eyes
back in your head,

12:49.689 --> 12:51.379
or I'll put 'em back for you.

12:53.241 --> 12:54.551
Did you warm up?

12:54.620 --> 12:56.103
- No, I thought
I'd just warm up

12:56.172 --> 12:57.482
right here in front
of these rubberneckers.

12:58.931 --> 13:00.517
- Okay, then.

13:00.586 --> 13:02.103
You're up.

13:14.275 --> 13:16.206
- Make every
minute worth it, baby.

13:16.275 --> 13:18.620
This is for Usher, baby.
Watch this.

13:54.448 --> 13:56.000
What?

14:30.206 --> 14:31.689
- Lord Jesus,
please don't make me

14:31.758 --> 14:33.689
go ham on one of these girls.

14:33.758 --> 14:36.448
- Direct line to God, huh?

14:36.517 --> 14:38.620
Didn't really help you before,
did it?

14:38.689 --> 14:40.206
- The last person that tried me

14:40.275 --> 14:42.931
wound up wearing their teeth
as a necklace.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.172
- Not in a joking
about it phase.

14:45.241 --> 14:46.517
Copy that.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.448
I'm surprised you'd
show your face here.

14:48.517 --> 14:50.517
- This bitch want
a set of matching earrings.

14:50.586 --> 14:52.137
- No, no.

14:52.206 --> 14:55.482
I'm saying Nicki, Drake, Wayne,

14:55.551 --> 14:56.931
they came to you.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.620
I'm just surprised you'd
want to be in a group.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.724
- I've had enough attention.

15:00.793 --> 15:03.482
- Oh, there's no such thing.

15:03.551 --> 15:05.758
I guess that's what happens
when your dad sticks around

15:05.827 --> 15:07.551
long enough for the baby photo.

15:07.620 --> 15:09.758
Well, he can see me on TV
and choke on his tongue.

15:09.827 --> 15:11.862
- Wow.

15:11.931 --> 15:14.034
And I thought
I had rage issues.

15:14.103 --> 15:16.448
- Well, the medication helps.

15:22.827 --> 15:24.827
- Derek!

15:24.896 --> 15:26.793
- Word travels fast.

15:26.862 --> 15:29.448
- You travel faster.

15:29.517 --> 15:30.655
You're everywhere!

15:30.724 --> 15:33.931
Except in Miami
with my daughter!

15:34.000 --> 15:35.655
- Sloane's there.

15:35.724 --> 15:37.758
- Yeah, Ahsha
won't talk to her.

15:37.827 --> 15:39.689
She won't tell us
what happened.

15:41.862 --> 15:44.448
You reverted to type.

15:44.517 --> 15:46.896
Party boy Derek.

15:46.965 --> 15:48.034
There's only
one problem with that:

15:48.103 --> 15:50.482
You married my daughter!

15:52.379 --> 15:53.862
I trusted you

15:53.931 --> 15:55.758
with my most prized possession,

15:55.827 --> 15:57.482
and this is what
you do with it?

16:00.517 --> 16:02.586
Derek...

16:02.655 --> 16:05.517
Go home.

16:05.586 --> 16:06.793
Fight for her.

16:06.862 --> 16:08.931
You've had your
ups and downs before.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.551
You bounce back!

16:10.620 --> 16:11.758
You still have a chance!

16:11.827 --> 16:13.137
- We're divorced.

16:17.931 --> 16:19.793
- You had to do
something pretty awful.

16:19.862 --> 16:22.137
- I'm the one that filed.

16:24.241 --> 16:26.379
- That doesn't make any sense.

16:27.793 --> 16:29.103
- Go home, Pete.

16:29.172 --> 16:31.551
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

16:31.620 --> 16:32.896
Not till you tell me...

16:32.965 --> 16:35.068
What could Ahsha
possibly have done?

16:35.137 --> 16:37.965
- Got pregnant.

16:38.034 --> 16:39.689
- Ahsha's pregnant?
- Was.

16:39.758 --> 16:42.793
It didn't fit with her career
track, so she got rid of it.

16:45.551 --> 16:47.448
- I had no idea she--
- Me neither.

16:47.517 --> 16:49.103
She didn't tell me
till it was too late.

16:49.172 --> 16:50.896
She cut me out completely.

16:50.965 --> 16:53.000
Sound familiar?

16:56.482 --> 16:58.000
- I gotta go.

16:58.068 --> 16:59.586
- Look, Pete...

17:08.344 --> 17:10.931
- You need to eat, sleep,
and breathe these steps.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.206
This is the choreography
you're going to be doing

17:12.275 --> 17:15.034
when the final 14
go live worldwide.

17:15.103 --> 17:17.103
- Wait, live worldwide?

17:17.172 --> 17:19.517
- Right, I fast-passed you.

17:19.586 --> 17:21.413
You didn't get
the big announcement.

17:21.482 --> 17:22.793
As soon as our new team
is elected,

17:22.862 --> 17:24.310
we are going live on ICN.

17:24.379 --> 17:26.241
Our first dance is gonna
be seen around the world.

17:26.310 --> 17:29.137
- But that's so public...

17:29.206 --> 17:30.517
- You're not trying out

17:30.586 --> 17:32.379
for the Jacksonville
Thunderbolts, darling.

17:32.448 --> 17:35.241
The Devil Girls will be in
the spotlight all season long.

17:36.896 --> 17:39.586
- What's she doing here?

17:39.655 --> 17:41.000
- She has a name.

17:41.068 --> 17:42.413
- She also has a reputation.

17:42.482 --> 17:44.172
- Look who's talking.

17:44.241 --> 17:46.482
- I was never a sketch
on "Saturday Night Live".

17:46.551 --> 17:48.000
- I never took a bullet.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.310
- I'm gonna ask you to just go
right over there.

17:50.379 --> 17:52.965
Okay.

17:53.034 --> 17:54.586
She just showed up.

17:54.655 --> 17:57.551
- We don't need that kind
of publicity, Kyle.

17:57.620 --> 17:58.758
Get rid of her.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.103
- I'm on it.

18:04.724 --> 18:06.137
- I am not asking you to date.

18:06.206 --> 18:08.482
I am asking you to bone.

18:08.551 --> 18:10.413
Something, anything!

18:10.482 --> 18:11.965
This plant!

18:12.034 --> 18:13.793
- I could've been married
by now.

18:13.862 --> 18:15.344
- It was a beautiful ring.

18:15.413 --> 18:17.724
- Too bad he couldn't
accept it.

18:17.793 --> 18:20.413
- He couldn't accept a lot
about the relationship.

18:21.586 --> 18:24.482
Zero's on his own path.

18:24.551 --> 18:25.586
But you both tried.

18:25.655 --> 18:27.827
You had an amazing
experience together.

18:27.896 --> 18:29.689
He's the guy you came out with.

18:29.758 --> 18:30.793
He's always going to have

18:30.862 --> 18:33.034
a special place in your heart.

18:33.103 --> 18:36.068
But now, you need to move on.

18:36.137 --> 18:38.137
- You know, I'm fine
the way I am.

18:38.206 --> 18:39.965
Some people aren't
meant to date.

18:40.034 --> 18:41.448
Some people are meant
to be alone.

18:41.517 --> 18:43.241
- Oh, Jesus.

18:43.310 --> 18:45.551
We need shots immediately.

18:45.620 --> 18:46.724
It doesn't matter what.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.172
Line 'em up five deep.

18:57.758 --> 19:00.965
- Oh, check out the threads!

19:01.034 --> 19:03.034
They pimp like that at UCLA?

19:03.103 --> 19:04.034
- Well, you know,
I'm just trying

19:04.103 --> 19:05.517
to keep up with you guys.

19:05.586 --> 19:07.931
- All right. You got
that same style on the court?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.068
I've never seen you play.

19:09.137 --> 19:10.448
- You don't watch college ball?

19:10.517 --> 19:12.896
- I do.

19:12.965 --> 19:14.379
- That's Marcus Lowe's brother.

19:14.448 --> 19:16.137
- Oh, your brother
was a legend.

19:16.206 --> 19:17.482
And le artiste.

19:17.551 --> 19:19.758
The greatest player
to never play the game.

19:19.827 --> 19:21.172
- He played.

19:21.241 --> 19:23.068
- Sorry, man,
you know what I mean.

19:23.137 --> 19:24.482
What a loss.

19:24.551 --> 19:27.034
What was it like to play
with Marcus growing up?

19:27.103 --> 19:29.137
- I learned everything
from him.

19:29.206 --> 19:30.620
- It's a shame
what happened to him.

19:30.689 --> 19:32.448
We had the number one
draft pick his year.

19:32.517 --> 19:34.517
Would've been amazing
to play with that guy.

19:34.586 --> 19:36.344
- Sure.

19:39.689 --> 19:41.034
- What about that guy?

19:41.103 --> 19:43.482
- All right, A., stop pointing.

19:43.551 --> 19:46.241
And B., he's got a woman
hanging off him.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.517
I'm not trying to go down
that road again.

19:48.586 --> 19:50.896
- You have a problem
with everyone.

19:50.965 --> 19:53.379
- It's not that easy.

19:53.448 --> 19:56.000
- It actually is that easy.

19:56.068 --> 19:57.827
Look at all the crap
I went through.

19:57.896 --> 19:59.344
Now I'm out there

19:59.413 --> 20:01.103
and having the time of my life.

20:01.172 --> 20:03.068
You need to do that!

20:03.137 --> 20:04.931
I'm telling you, it is great

20:05.000 --> 20:05.931
on the other side.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.241
Come on and join me.

20:11.827 --> 20:14.103
That's my car.

20:18.172 --> 20:20.034
If you don't bang
someone tonight,

20:20.103 --> 20:21.931
I'm gonna cut off your junk

20:22.000 --> 20:24.517
with something dull and rusty.

20:47.379 --> 20:49.000
- Oh!

20:49.068 --> 20:51.034
- You got this, right, rookie?

20:51.103 --> 20:53.034
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:53.103 --> 20:55.137
Fellas, it's on me.

20:55.206 --> 20:56.758
I got this.

20:56.827 --> 20:59.655
- My man.

21:06.413 --> 21:08.965
- What position do you play?

21:09.034 --> 21:11.862
- I'm a rookie.

21:11.931 --> 21:14.655
- Well, hopefully
not everywhere.

21:56.344 --> 21:58.586
- I need to see some ID, man.

21:58.655 --> 21:59.931
Whoa, okay, man.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.586
Just take it, just take it.
- The drawer too!

22:01.655 --> 22:03.448
- All right, all right,
all right, all right, man.

22:03.517 --> 22:06.275
- A Seattle cap? Seriously?
- Shut up!

22:06.344 --> 22:07.586
- I'm not saying
they're a bad team.

22:07.655 --> 22:09.344
I'm saying
they're a horrible team!

22:09.413 --> 22:11.344
Pick a different city,
pick a different sport!

22:11.413 --> 22:13.103
- Are you serious?

22:13.172 --> 22:15.206
I've got a gun!
- There's football,

22:15.275 --> 22:17.413
basketball,
ever heard of snooker?

22:17.482 --> 22:18.827
It's like billiards but with

22:18.896 --> 22:20.413
more balls and more British.
- Hurry up!

22:20.482 --> 22:22.068
- All right, man,
just calm down.

22:22.137 --> 22:24.137
- It takes a lot of balls to
say snooker's a sport anyway.

22:24.206 --> 22:25.413
The Olympics doesn't
recognize it,

22:25.482 --> 22:27.034
but what do they know?

22:27.103 --> 22:29.275
They used to give medals
for solo synchronized swimming!

22:29.344 --> 22:30.793
I mean, what is that?

22:30.862 --> 22:32.172
Someone said if you can smoke
while playing--

22:33.241 --> 22:35.758
Oh!

22:35.827 --> 22:38.482
What the hell, man?
- Oh my God.

22:38.551 --> 22:39.827
- I wasn't gonna shoot anybody!

22:39.896 --> 22:42.172
- You didn't, he did.
- I am so sorry.

22:42.241 --> 22:43.310
- You made me go on forever,

22:43.379 --> 22:44.379
and when you finally jump in,

22:44.448 --> 22:46.310
this is what you do?

22:46.379 --> 22:48.517
Holy shit!

22:52.517 --> 22:54.103
I still have use of my arm,

22:54.172 --> 22:55.620
thank you.
- Sorry.

22:55.689 --> 22:57.896
Just wanted
to make sure you get home okay.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.344
Oh, here.

23:04.275 --> 23:07.172
Got these at
the hospital vending machine.

23:07.241 --> 23:09.931
You couldn't decide which one
you wanted at the liquor store,

23:10.000 --> 23:11.965
so...

23:12.034 --> 23:14.241
I got you both.

23:16.827 --> 23:19.379
- Why are you here?

23:20.689 --> 23:22.724
- I told you.

23:24.206 --> 23:25.827
- If you're gonna kiss me,
kiss me.

23:27.931 --> 23:29.551
I wasn't gonna kiss you.

23:41.551 --> 23:43.241
- Ah-ah!
- Sorry.

23:43.310 --> 23:45.000
- I didn't say stop.

24:30.482 --> 24:32.379
- Coach Davenport?

24:32.448 --> 24:34.931
- Hi, have we met?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.448
- Not officially.

24:36.517 --> 24:39.000
I work for the League in
Commissioner Matthews' office.

24:39.068 --> 24:40.413
Eve Vincent.

24:40.482 --> 24:42.448
- Vincent.

24:42.517 --> 24:44.758
That's a popular name
around here.

24:44.827 --> 24:48.689
- My parents made
quite the names for themselves.

24:48.758 --> 24:51.448
I'm Olivia
and Chase's daughter.

24:51.517 --> 24:54.172
- Olivia and Chase
don't have a daughter.

24:55.896 --> 24:57.724
Then those checks
to my boarding schools

24:57.793 --> 25:00.551
and high-priced nannies
were a big mistake.

25:02.206 --> 25:04.655
May I?
- Uh... Sure!

25:04.724 --> 25:05.448
Yeah.

25:06.689 --> 25:09.551
- My parents didn't feel

25:09.620 --> 25:11.448
this was the
safest place for me,

25:11.517 --> 25:14.965
with Oscar Kinkade
roaming the halls.

25:17.137 --> 25:18.620
- Wow.

25:18.689 --> 25:21.517
Olivia and Chase had a kid

25:21.586 --> 25:23.241
no one knew about.

25:23.310 --> 25:25.758
- So did you, right?

25:27.413 --> 25:29.172
Sorry, I didn't mean to--

25:29.241 --> 25:32.034
- No, it's okay.

25:32.103 --> 25:35.103
Sorry about Olivia.

25:35.172 --> 25:37.448
And Chase.

25:40.482 --> 25:44.724
Must be something
being around here.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.448
- A lot of bad happened here.

25:46.517 --> 25:48.655
But a lot of good.

25:48.724 --> 25:51.724
This was the place
of their greatest glory.

25:53.034 --> 25:55.172
Being here...

25:55.241 --> 25:58.068
Makes me feel...

25:58.137 --> 26:00.206
I don't know.

26:00.275 --> 26:02.310
Closer to them.

26:02.379 --> 26:03.655
Two scotch on the rocks.

26:03.724 --> 26:06.482
- I don't drink, actually.

26:06.551 --> 26:08.724
- Oh, sorry.

26:08.793 --> 26:10.344
You looked like you
could've used one.

26:12.103 --> 26:15.172
- Especially when I
brought up your daughter.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.034
What's she like?

26:17.103 --> 26:19.965
- Like her mother.

26:20.034 --> 26:22.896
They're a lot alike
in a lot of ways.

26:25.827 --> 26:26.793
- Well...

26:26.862 --> 26:29.448
You're clearly a great guy,

26:29.517 --> 26:31.482
one I look forward
to working with.

26:31.551 --> 26:33.965
Have a good night.

27:26.172 --> 27:27.689
- You leaving so soon?

27:27.758 --> 27:29.379
- I left my number
on the nightstand.

27:38.034 --> 27:41.137
- This is $20,000.

27:41.206 --> 27:43.586
You know I'm a player, right?

27:43.655 --> 27:45.344
- I also saw how you looked
at that bar bill

27:45.413 --> 27:46.724
your boys left you.

27:46.793 --> 27:48.586
I thought you could use it.

28:02.275 --> 28:05.068
- Cameras are getting set up
outside as we speak.

28:05.137 --> 28:06.482
The names I call, haul ass

28:06.551 --> 28:08.034
into uniforms, hair, and makeup

28:08.103 --> 28:09.586
'cause we going live!

28:11.620 --> 28:13.448
Has anyone seen London?

28:17.482 --> 28:19.827
Listen up!

28:19.896 --> 28:21.206
Peyton!

28:23.068 --> 28:24.931
Welcome back.

28:25.000 --> 28:25.931
Denver.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.344
Mary-Beth.

28:27.413 --> 28:29.034
Christine.

28:29.103 --> 28:30.034
Alicia.

28:30.103 --> 28:31.310
Harper.

28:34.172 --> 28:35.931
Jamie.

28:37.586 --> 28:39.172
Congratulations.

28:45.724 --> 28:49.103
Romy!
That's right, OG.

28:57.931 --> 29:01.000
- Is it too late?
- It is.

29:02.379 --> 29:04.068
You're relieved.

29:04.137 --> 29:05.827
- I am.

29:05.896 --> 29:07.310
But...

29:07.379 --> 29:08.827
- But what?

29:08.896 --> 29:11.862
- It just doesn't feel the way
I thought it would feel.

29:13.931 --> 29:16.275
I've been in a hole for months.

29:16.344 --> 29:18.482
A shut-in!

29:18.551 --> 29:20.448
I liked having
a place to come to

29:20.517 --> 29:22.448
to do what I loved!

29:22.517 --> 29:24.620
What I still love.

29:28.793 --> 29:31.275
Hell, why am I
crying about this?

29:31.344 --> 29:33.586
- You tell me.

29:33.655 --> 29:35.413
- Because I just realized

29:35.482 --> 29:36.724
how bad I wanted this.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.241
I just let it go.

29:44.310 --> 29:45.655
- You didn't.

29:45.724 --> 29:48.206
You're number 14.

29:48.275 --> 29:49.206
- But I thought you said--

29:49.275 --> 29:51.586
- I say a lot of things.

29:51.655 --> 29:54.000
But I needed to hear
you say that.

29:55.206 --> 29:56.551
You better get changed!

29:56.620 --> 29:58.172
You're about to go worldwide!

29:58.241 --> 29:59.724
Again.

30:06.620 --> 30:10.068
- Looking good, girls.

30:10.137 --> 30:12.965
- It feels good.

30:13.034 --> 30:14.448
What?

30:14.517 --> 30:16.241
- I thought you were out.

30:16.310 --> 30:17.620
- Well, you look disappointed.

30:20.517 --> 30:22.103
- Not at all.

31:52.793 --> 31:54.620
Ooh!

32:12.000 --> 32:14.517
- Everybody...

32:21.379 --> 32:22.310
- Oh, that was incredible.

32:22.379 --> 32:24.275
Was that hot enough for you?

32:26.206 --> 32:28.586
- Kyle.
- You're welcome.

32:28.655 --> 32:31.551
- I thought I told you
to dump her.

32:34.137 --> 32:35.517
- That's it.

32:35.586 --> 32:37.551
I've had it!
This is my job!

32:37.620 --> 32:39.758
Either you let me do it,
or find someone else who will.

32:41.586 --> 32:43.724
- Okay.

32:43.793 --> 32:45.551
The Devil Girls are all yours.

32:47.551 --> 32:50.310
- Oh, good.

32:50.379 --> 32:51.931
Well...

32:52.000 --> 32:54.724
I'm doing two jobs,
captain and director,

32:54.793 --> 32:56.758
so I should be getting
a way bigger salary.

32:56.827 --> 32:58.758
Double even!

32:58.827 --> 33:01.482
- You got it.

33:01.551 --> 33:03.586
Double pay for Kyle.

33:03.655 --> 33:06.793
But if anything goes wrong,

33:06.862 --> 33:09.482
including blowback on this one,

33:09.551 --> 33:10.896
you'll lose it all.

33:10.965 --> 33:13.275
Kiss your cash
and your autonomy goodbye.

33:14.724 --> 33:16.310
Congrats on a great night.

33:37.655 --> 33:40.482
Miguel, I have something
to tell you.

33:40.551 --> 33:43.724
And I can't put it off anymore.

33:45.517 --> 33:47.068
I've been taking care of you

33:47.137 --> 33:48.758
since your mom passed.

33:48.827 --> 33:51.206
Longer than we thought.

33:51.275 --> 33:53.103
And...

33:53.172 --> 33:56.862
I thought it might
not be a bad idea

33:58.000 --> 34:01.241
if at some point,
we made it...

34:01.310 --> 34:03.551
Permanent.

34:03.620 --> 34:07.931
If someday you wanted to,

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
and that someday is coming up.

34:11.068 --> 34:13.310
- You want to adopt me?

34:14.724 --> 34:17.620
- Only if you want me to.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.758
I mean...

34:19.827 --> 34:21.586
I'm not easy,

34:21.655 --> 34:23.586
but neither are you.

34:23.655 --> 34:25.344
I'm insulting a child.

34:27.724 --> 34:29.620
Listen,

34:29.689 --> 34:31.551
it's okay.

34:31.620 --> 34:33.517
Whatever you want to do.

34:33.586 --> 34:35.000
I won't be upset.

34:39.827 --> 34:41.965
Okay, are you...

34:42.034 --> 34:44.000
You sure?
- Yeah.

34:46.655 --> 34:48.586
- Yeah.

34:50.137 --> 34:52.344
- I'm so sorry
I had to call you here.

34:52.413 --> 34:54.827
You were his closest family
in the area.

35:03.758 --> 35:06.448
- Is this Pete Davenport?

35:09.000 --> 35:10.551
He died on impact.

35:10.620 --> 35:14.517
His blood alcohol was .28.

35:14.586 --> 35:16.551
- He was drinking?

35:16.620 --> 35:18.448
- Mm.

35:32.896 --> 35:34.724
- Pete was one
of the most enduring

35:34.793 --> 35:36.000
personalities in the game.

35:36.068 --> 35:38.758
He gave everything.
As a player,

35:38.827 --> 35:40.379
as a coach,

35:40.448 --> 35:42.896
and as a man.

35:42.965 --> 35:45.344
The League couldn't be prouder.

35:45.413 --> 35:47.586
Or more grateful.

35:56.206 --> 35:57.620
- What you said was beautiful.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.448
- Thanks.

35:59.517 --> 36:01.137
I heard who you were.

36:01.206 --> 36:02.758
I worked with your mother.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.137
- I know.

36:04.206 --> 36:05.862
Those were some
of her best years.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.482
- Did she say that?

36:07.551 --> 36:08.896
- No.

36:08.965 --> 36:11.241
She said other things
about you.

36:12.586 --> 36:14.448
- Well...

36:14.517 --> 36:16.689
It was a shame,
what happened to her.

36:16.758 --> 36:20.000
- At least you got through
this eulogy without laughing.

36:21.275 --> 36:23.655
Excuse me.

36:29.103 --> 36:32.137
- I'm gonna take Lionel home.

36:32.206 --> 36:35.448
- Go. I'll answer
any questions.

36:52.137 --> 36:54.551
- You should know better
than to keep secrets from me.

36:55.206 --> 36:56.655
- What are you talking about?

36:56.724 --> 36:58.827
- You can't go back to Miami.

36:58.896 --> 37:00.620
You're not welcome in Miami.

37:00.689 --> 37:02.793
You took such
a giant dump there

37:02.862 --> 37:04.689
that they cancelled
your contract

37:04.758 --> 37:06.413
and banned you from the arena.

37:06.482 --> 37:08.689
You lost your wife,
and you lost your job.

37:08.758 --> 37:11.931
- Careful doing your
victory lap in those heels.

37:14.034 --> 37:16.448
- I didn't come in here
to do a victory lap.

37:17.965 --> 37:20.551
I came with an offer.

37:20.620 --> 37:22.689
Come back to the Devils.

37:22.758 --> 37:25.827
I don't have all the money
in the world to give you,

37:25.896 --> 37:28.655
but you're not
worth all the money.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.931
People have forgotten
who Derek Roman is.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Including you.

37:35.068 --> 37:36.000
And honestly,

37:36.068 --> 37:38.034
I don't see him either.

37:38.103 --> 37:40.586
If you are going to find him,

37:40.655 --> 37:42.689
it's gonna be here.

37:44.448 --> 37:47.482
Think about it.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.586
- Noah?

37:54.655 --> 37:56.034
What are you doing here?

37:56.103 --> 37:58.482
- I'm the new
sideline reporter for ISN.

37:58.551 --> 38:00.827
What are you doing here?

38:01.793 --> 38:04.896
- I'm the Executive
Vice President of the team.

38:21.413 --> 38:23.137
- If I didn't know any better,

38:23.206 --> 38:24.965
I'd say you were trying
to show me up in that dance.

38:25.034 --> 38:26.517
- Well,
if I didn't know any better

38:26.586 --> 38:28.724
I'd say you didn't want me
in here at all.

38:33.931 --> 38:36.068
- I'm no pushover.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.758
- I'm no pushover either.

39:00.206 --> 39:02.344
- Everyone was there

39:02.413 --> 39:04.689
for Pete Davenport today.

39:07.241 --> 39:09.448
He wasn't there for Dad.

39:11.275 --> 39:13.965
No one was there for you.

39:14.034 --> 39:17.034
Jelena Howard.

39:17.103 --> 39:20.965
Oscar Kinkaid.

39:21.034 --> 39:23.620
Not a single person

39:23.689 --> 39:25.620
in Devils Arena.

39:28.862 --> 39:31.068
I will be

39:31.137 --> 39:32.655
when I take each

39:32.724 --> 39:34.586
and every one of them down.

39:38.862 --> 39:40.931
Everyone who hurt you.

39:44.034 --> 39:46.172
Who kept me from you.

39:49.482 --> 39:52.241
When I'm done,

39:52.310 --> 39:54.758
there won't be a Devils left.

40:00.241 --> 40:02.724
Cheers, Pete.

40:06.793 --> 40:08.965
- Next time on
"Hit the Floor"...

40:09.034 --> 40:10.517
- Jeremy?
- Hey, Derek.

40:10.586 --> 40:12.103
- At some point, you need
to accept when it's game over.

40:12.172 --> 40:13.482
- If I haven't won,
then it's not game over.

40:13.551 --> 40:14.551
- London.

40:14.620 --> 40:15.896
- Curtis,
what are you doing here?

40:15.965 --> 40:17.275
- I am gonna have
to write two checks

40:17.344 --> 40:18.482
for the size of that thing.

40:18.551 --> 40:20.310
- Hail Derek Roman!

40:20.379 --> 40:22.758
The emperor has returned!

40:22.827 --> 40:25.137
- Hello, didn't know
anyone was in here.

40:25.206 --> 40:26.344
- I know all about you.

40:26.413 --> 40:27.655
- Don't believe
everything you hear.

40:27.724 --> 40:28.896
- Couldn't agree more.

40:28.965 --> 40:30.586
- I am a walking hot mic.

40:30.655 --> 40:32.827
It's either a fire
you're willing to play with,

40:32.896 --> 40:33.827
or it's not.

40:33.896 --> 40:37.896
- Fire!
