- Where's the journal?

00:04.672 --> 00:07.441
- I thought you had it.
- If I had it, would I be here?

00:07.541 --> 00:08.742

not important anymore.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.187
Hoyt.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.888
We got a body down
by the Chimney Rocks.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.691
It's Luke.

00:23.791 --> 00:27.395
When you hired us, you failed
to mention Avery McCallister.

00:27.495 --> 00:31.365
Luke told me that he and Paige
had $15 million in crypto.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.701
That old burned-out
truck Dad said he sold?

00:33.801 --> 00:34.902

all worked up.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.105
Nope. This has.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.372
That's your cousin Bryan.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.141
There was a hospital bracelet also.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.076
You didn't tell me the SEC
is investigating you.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.777
- Oh.
- Is it true?

00:43.877 --> 00:47.615
Luke said the seed phrase words
were highlighted on two pages.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.550
Damn it.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.985
- Where exactly?
- Right around here.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.622
My dad saw your man in the woods
around those parts.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.257
Okay. Let's go.

00:56.357 --> 01:00.060
Walter. The sheriff's department
is coming for you. Run!

01:00.161 --> 01:02.463

just to the edge of the woods.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.931

something we can call you?

01:39.867 --> 01:41.869

01:41.969 --> 01:43.771

01:46.407 --> 01:48.376
were guests at

02:02.390 --> 02:05.526
Okay.
His name was Luke.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.329

10:39.006 --> 10:40.741
Okay.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.142
Time to go.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.177
Found a body in Pine Tree Park.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.413
Okay.
Well, just be careful.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.848
Always am.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.728
So, the caller said
that they found a body?

11:00.828 --> 11:01.829
Yep.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.865
Any chance we get lucky
and it's just somebody sleeping?

11:11.171 --> 11:12.439
Up there!

11:18.445 --> 11:20.680
Something tells me no.

11:27.620 --> 11:30.958
We're meeting Maya Baker,
the wife of the parachutist.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.293
Worst part of the job, isn't it?

11:33.393 --> 11:34.594
Notifying next of kin.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.464
I'm not a fan of this part, either.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.598
Mm-hmm.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.302
Hey, Pops, what do you got?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.905
Forensics just got done
with Brett Baker's parachute.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.107
The lines are a mess.
And get this--

11:47.207 --> 11:48.708
one of them was cut.

11:50.277 --> 11:53.446
Really?
Well, that changes things.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.048
Um, all right, thanks.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.984
You got it, boss.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.787
Looks like we might have
ourselves a homicide, Hoyt.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.971
Brett did these drop-in events
as a stunt.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.607
H-He was supposed to be
at Lake Helena today.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.742
Some kind of
gender-reveal party.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.511
Was that the cowboy costume?

12:24.611 --> 12:26.346
Part of the gig.

12:27.180 --> 12:30.250
I can't believe this.
Brett was murdered?

12:30.350 --> 12:32.485
We think that somebody may
have tampered with his chute.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.187
What did he do before this?

12:34.287 --> 12:36.756
He used to be a smokejumper.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.625
Brett loved doing it.

12:38.725 --> 12:42.695
He just, um...
had to quit, I guess.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.364
How come?

12:44.464 --> 12:47.667
Brett was going through
a really rough patch.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.804
His best friend died
on a fireline.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.539
And Brett watched him burn.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.708
What was his friend's name?

12:55.809 --> 12:57.210
Dave Ludwig.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.146
It was ruled as an accident,

12:59.246 --> 13:01.481
but Brett took it really hard.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.050
He blamed himself.

13:04.651 --> 13:07.520
Yeah, I know how that goes.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.860
Anybody else hold it
against him?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.462
Dave's father, Frank.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.164
He's the fire squad leader,

13:17.264 --> 13:19.967
so it was pretty tough
for Brett to stick around.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.035
Frank blamed his son's death
on Brett?

13:22.836 --> 13:24.304
Yeah.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.844
Enough to want him dead?

13:35.682 --> 13:37.918
♪ Desperate and dangerous

13:38.018 --> 13:40.854
♪ A gun in my hand

13:42.389 --> 13:46.159
♪ Armed to the teeth

13:46.259 --> 13:48.095
♪ To fight authority

13:48.195 --> 13:50.931
Isn't there a less... public
place we could do this?

13:51.031 --> 13:53.366
Two old friends
grabbing a drink.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.568
Huh? Sit.

13:57.404 --> 14:00.107
And tell me
how our work is going.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.209
We've given you a week.
Where's the money?

14:02.309 --> 14:04.177
The account's heavily encrypted.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.612
Ah.

14:05.712 --> 14:06.947
Program requires
a lot of man-hours.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.249
Well, lucky or you,
I'm extending your deadline.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.350
You've got 24 hours.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.451
That isn't enough.

14:12.119 --> 14:14.187
Do whatever you need to do,

14:14.287 --> 14:16.089
and you will get the million
you were offered.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.625
A generous finder's fee

14:18.725 --> 14:21.228
seeing that the money belongs
to us in the first place.

14:21.328 --> 14:22.930
The pages you stole...

14:26.099 --> 14:28.768
We wouldn't be here...

14:28.868 --> 14:30.870
if I hadn't stolen those pages.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.973
They'd be
in a police evidence bag,

14:33.073 --> 14:34.874
out of your grasp.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.216
Avery.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.617
I know you've had
business troubles.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.819
Liquidity issues.
Nothing more.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.755
Tell yourself whatever you want.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.757
Just know that if you fail,
in the middle of the night,

14:50.857 --> 14:55.228
a man will enter your house,
and you will wake up alone.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.966
Carla and Emily.
Gas, maybe.

14:59.066 --> 15:03.003
Or a long, thin wire pushed in
through the corner of the eye.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.411
Move fast.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.017
See you soon.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.996
See, it doesn't look
like it, but this right here--

15:29.096 --> 15:31.164
that's the same model.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.866
Oh. Oh, I see.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.335
Can I help you?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.004
- In the middle of training.
- Hey, there.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.671
Lewis and Clark County
Sheriff's Department.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.373
I'm Sheriff Arlen.
This here's Deputy Hoyt.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.109
Looking for
a, uh, Frank Ludwig.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.044
Oh, he's right behind you.
Word to the wise--

15:44.144 --> 15:48.448
he just quit smoking, so I think
I would watch your step.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.484
- Hey, there.
- Is that Texas I hear?

15:51.584 --> 15:53.120
Long way from home, cowboy.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.487
Sheriff Arlen.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.389
Oh, apologies, Sheriff.
I was just bustin' ya.

15:56.489 --> 15:57.724
What brings you out?

15:57.824 --> 15:59.326
Do you mind if we take
a little walk?

15:59.426 --> 16:01.628
Sure.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.297
We're here about Brett Baker.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.966
Yeah, I heard about that.
It's a terrible thing.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.235
So you know already?

16:08.335 --> 16:09.569
Jumpers are a tight community.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.238
Did you hear he was murdered?

16:11.338 --> 16:13.206
- What?
- Murdered.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.807
Somebody messed with his chute.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.243
Aw, hell.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.245
We spoke to his wife today.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.981
She says that you blamed Brett
for your son's death.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.550
Do you want to tell us
about that?

16:28.555 --> 16:30.157
I mean, what's there to say?

16:30.257 --> 16:32.559
My boy got caught on
the wrong side of a fire break.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.261
I'm sorry to hear that.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.828
And you think that
that's Brett's fault?

16:36.896 --> 16:39.232
Look, my son had just died.
I barely had a body to bury.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.668
So, yeah, I might have come down
a little hard on Brett,

16:41.768 --> 16:43.736
said some things in the
aftermath I'm not proud of.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.572
Enough to chase him
off the job?

16:46.339 --> 16:48.575
We parachute into the middle of
forest fires to put them out.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.843
When guys make mistakes,
people end up dead.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.845
- So you do blame Brett.
- You son of a bitch.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.447
- You come in here
and accuse me--
- Whoa, whoa, easy!

16:54.547 --> 16:56.049
Why don't we just, you know,
dial it down a little bit?

16:56.149 --> 16:57.517
Thanks, Coop.
I'm good.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.353
So you think I had it out
for one of my former jumpers

17:00.453 --> 17:02.355
and I sent him to his death?
Get real, Sheriff.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.857
You need anything else,
you talk to my lawyer.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.542
The good Samaritan.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.946
Yeah. Sure.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.717
My name's Cassie.
What's yours?

17:30.817 --> 17:32.619
I know who you are.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.587
Well, I had to try.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.289
How can I help you if
I don't know what to call you?

17:36.389 --> 17:39.159
Oh, come on, now.
No one can help me.

17:39.259 --> 17:43.730
Not even a...
good Samaritan like you.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.935
The police think you killed
Mark, Mary, Luke, and Paige.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.070
Me, I'm not so sure.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.572
Here's what I know.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.776
That day we met on the road,

17:56.876 --> 17:58.845
you had Mark Woodman's body
under a tarp

17:58.945 --> 18:00.580
in the back of that Suburban.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.517
It was not a question.
I know you did.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.854
We found the figurine
you put in his pocket

18:07.954 --> 18:11.824
before you left him-- and
the others inside your cabin.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.362
Now, Mark was
the backpacker we found.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.164
He fell.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.433
Or at least that's what
I told his parents.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.935
Go on.

18:23.035 --> 18:26.706
What's bothering me
is why you moved the body.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.040
Did someone tell you to?

18:33.580 --> 18:35.648
You know, Mark's parents
are in a lot of pain,

18:35.748 --> 18:37.016
and they just want
to know what happened.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.050
I didn't kill him.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.629
People always think
the worst of me.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.999
You moved his body...

18:53.099 --> 18:57.304
and you left one of your
figurines for us to find.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.808
Tell me about the figurines.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.178
They were meant for protection

19:05.278 --> 19:08.415
for what happens when they
pass over, that they...

19:11.918 --> 19:13.586
...they have a friend with them.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.055
They didn't find one
on Mary or Luke.

19:17.424 --> 19:18.658
They didn't need protection?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.494
Not from me.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.198
And that is what you're asking,
isn't it?

19:25.298 --> 19:27.900
I guess I'm just
a little confused.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.339
Is this one of Paige?

19:32.439 --> 19:34.674
Why do you still have it?

19:34.774 --> 19:36.843
And if these are
for protecting people,

19:36.943 --> 19:38.845
why did you confess
to murdering her?

19:50.156 --> 19:52.425
- Veggie burger for you.
- Thank you.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.294
Go ahead, waste your time.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.267
We need to figure out
our next move.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.769
Like I told you--
there is no next move.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.070
Luke and Paige are dead.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.639
We had a job.
It's done.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.641
No, but the money
is still out there!

20:08.741 --> 20:10.209
Avery was onto it.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.312
I bet he has
those journal pages.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.781
Doesn't matter without Paige.
That's what Luke said.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.053
Howdy.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.091
How's the pie here?

20:25.191 --> 20:27.327
It's better than what you serve
at the campground.

20:27.427 --> 20:30.297
I'll be the judge of that.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.099
Oh, don't look so surprised.

20:33.199 --> 20:36.336
- I told you I had my eye on you.
- Yeah?

20:36.436 --> 20:39.472
Well, you'd better be careful--
someone might cut it out.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.074
Your eye.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.176
You'd do well to mind
your manners, son.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.114
- Sorry.
- How can I help you?

20:48.214 --> 20:49.482
I know you two
were up at my camp

20:49.582 --> 20:50.950
looking for Paige and Luke.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.852
What I want to know is, is why.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.755
Luke and Paige are dead.
They caught the guy.

20:55.855 --> 20:56.956
Mountain freak.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.925
Is that a fact?

20:59.025 --> 21:01.494
Well, yes, Luke is dead.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.796
Arrow to the neck.
Poor thing.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.264
And Mary.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.700
But the "mountain freak,"
as you call him,

21:07.800 --> 21:10.169
says he killed Paige,
yet there's no body.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.439
Is there a point to all this?

21:12.539 --> 21:15.141
Yes, there is.
I've got a business to run,

21:15.241 --> 21:17.109
and I need to know what happened
up in those woods

21:17.209 --> 21:19.045
so I can protect my campers.

21:19.145 --> 21:21.348
Please.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.550
What are you really doing here?

21:23.650 --> 21:27.354
What if I told you that
I think Paige is still alive?

21:31.257 --> 21:33.125
I'd say you have my attention.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.227
Hm.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.180
All right, so,
we've got a dead cowboy,

21:54.280 --> 21:56.248
we got a tampered chute,
we got a dysfunctional

21:56.349 --> 21:58.050
smokejumping unit
with baggage.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.387
Nice and clean when
you lay it out like that.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.326
You went at Frank pretty hard.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.696
Is there something
you want to tell me?

22:09.796 --> 22:11.431
People make mistakes.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.999
It's up to leaders
to navigate them.

22:14.266 --> 22:15.902
What about
the other smokejumpers?

22:16.002 --> 22:18.905
I mean, the other recruits don't
really make sense, you know?

22:19.005 --> 22:21.107
Maybe.

22:21.207 --> 22:22.609
Maybe not.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.712
This is Frank's number two.
We met him earlier.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.580
Cooper.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.682
Might be worth looking into.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.350
Hey.

22:31.451 --> 22:32.952
So, we got something.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.854
Turns out there were
a handful of reported thefts

22:34.954 --> 22:36.255
last fire season.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.790
Wait. Are you telling me
that-- that dirtbags

22:37.890 --> 22:39.526
wait until the neighborhoods
are evacuated,

22:39.626 --> 22:41.093
then they go in and
they fill their pockets?

22:41.193 --> 22:43.262
Yeah, I know. It happens
every fire season here.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.731
- Wow.
- Yeah, well,

22:44.831 --> 22:46.433
these ones right here

22:46.533 --> 22:49.201
accused Frank's
smokejumper unit directly.

22:49.301 --> 22:50.903
And, of course,
that's not all.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.973
Our victim, Brett Baker,
started renting a storage unit

22:54.073 --> 22:56.576
outside of town right about
the time of the accusations.

22:59.078 --> 23:02.148
Let's do this.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.051
Wait.
Why don't you just do LASIK?

23:05.151 --> 23:06.318
'Cause I have a flat eyeball.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.054
- What?!
- I know!

23:08.154 --> 23:09.989
Hey. Look who's here!

23:10.089 --> 23:13.593
Yikes. Is, uh, Denise telling
you all about her UFO theory?

23:13.693 --> 23:15.462
She is.
We're not alone.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.996
- Mnh-mnh.
- Wow.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.231
So you're fitting right in.
This is great.

23:19.331 --> 23:20.467
So how'd it go with that guy?

23:23.736 --> 23:25.572
Why don't I go make us some tea?

23:25.672 --> 23:28.340
Uh, yes. Oh, one sugar, please.
Thank you!

23:29.642 --> 23:32.779
- You hate tea.
- I know. So?

23:32.879 --> 23:34.647
So, I talked to our mystery man
about his little figurines,

23:34.747 --> 23:36.616
and he said he made them
for protection.

23:36.716 --> 23:37.650
Pretty funny way

23:37.750 --> 23:39.018
- to protect people.
- Yeah.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.153
So, the carved hearts
in the figurines,

23:41.253 --> 23:42.522
what did he say about that?

23:42.622 --> 23:43.823
Nothing.
He just shut down.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.925
But they have to be connected
to the Bleeding Heart Murder.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.359
Yeah, maybe.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.128
I mean, he at least
knows about it.

23:49.228 --> 23:52.599
We just need to figure out
who the hell this guy is.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.806
Brett rented a unit here--
didn't even tell his wife, huh?

23:59.906 --> 24:01.508
- Uh-huh.
- Hm!

24:02.274 --> 24:05.011
Sheriff's Department!
Hello?!

24:08.280 --> 24:09.281
Hoyt.

24:12.318 --> 24:13.986
He's gone.
Call it in.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.387
Jesus.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.390
I need units to
the Carroll Valley Storage.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.561
Hey. Look.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.967
He's still here.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.894
Sheriff's Department!
Don't move!

24:55.828 --> 24:57.564
Cut him off.

24:58.765 --> 25:00.499
Stop!

25:06.806 --> 25:08.575
Hey! Stop!

25:14.614 --> 25:16.015
Police!

25:16.115 --> 25:18.084
Stop right there!

25:25.491 --> 25:27.860
Dammit.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.397
All right. Let's go see
what they were after.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.771
Wow.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.240
Well, looks like we got
ourselves a little drop stash.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.542
If this is from
the fire-season theft,

25:43.643 --> 25:45.745
someone had to orchestrate this.

25:45.845 --> 25:48.615
Yeah, someone who's looking
to get their stash back.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.382
Or cover it up.

25:55.487 --> 25:56.623
Hiya, Frank.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.729
Anybody care to clue me in
as to why I'm here?

26:02.829 --> 26:05.598
We found a storage unit
that Brett rented in secret.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.600
Good for Brett.
Why do I care?

26:07.700 --> 26:10.436
It was full of stolen goods--
cash, jewelry.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.605
You son was
the notification contact.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.506
I don't understand.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.976
We have reason to believe
that your crew may be involved

26:17.076 --> 26:19.245
with a robbery ring
from last fire season.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.147
My guys are out there
saving lives

26:21.247 --> 26:22.949
and you think
they're robbing houses.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.283
Don't play dumb with us, Frank.

26:24.383 --> 26:26.352
Those homes are evacuated
in chaos.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.788
Lots of valuables
are left unattended.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.422
My son was a hero.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.659
And I'm not gonna sit here
and have you drag him

26:32.759 --> 26:34.093
or any of my crew
through the muck!

26:34.193 --> 26:35.427
Where were you
last night, Frank?

26:35.527 --> 26:37.096
Cleaning up a brush fire
on the ridge.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.530
And you can check me on that!

26:39.666 --> 26:41.768
Now, am I done here?!

26:46.973 --> 26:49.441
We'll call you.

26:51.644 --> 26:54.046
Well... that went smoothly.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.614
All right, if Frank
does have an alibi,

26:55.715 --> 26:57.483
that means somebody else
was at that unit last night,

26:57.583 --> 26:59.185
somebody who knows
what's in there.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.153
What are you thinking?

27:02.188 --> 27:03.956
Well, I hate to say it, but...

27:04.056 --> 27:05.825
I think Frank
might still be useful.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.399
Carla. Come in.
How are you?

27:13.499 --> 27:14.801
- Mm.
- Ohh.

27:14.901 --> 27:15.902
- Please, please. Come, come.
- Thank you.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.804
- Mm-hmm. Please.
- Okay.

27:17.904 --> 27:19.205
Well, what's this big emergency?

27:19.305 --> 27:20.873
Um...

27:21.841 --> 27:23.910
Wow. You move your
whole office in here or...

27:24.010 --> 27:25.344
- Oh.
- ...what?

27:25.444 --> 27:27.079
Oh, that's nothing. Um...

27:27.179 --> 27:28.547
Thanks for coming.
How are you?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.549
I'm fine. Um...

27:30.649 --> 27:33.319
Is this about your money problem
with the SEC?

27:33.419 --> 27:37.223
Oh. Uh...
I have this idea.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.992
I found this lovely
little Airbnb

27:40.092 --> 27:42.328
just outside of town--
charming little cottage.

27:42.428 --> 27:45.264
It's got llamas
and a hot tub.

27:45.364 --> 27:48.901
And I was thinking that, um,
you know, maybe we could, um,

27:49.035 --> 27:52.171
go away, as a family,
to make things right.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.006
Oh, I don't have to go
just yet.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.743
I mean, you can go up there
with Emily and, uh, you know,

27:56.843 --> 27:59.045
have some alone time,
kick back, and, uh,

27:59.145 --> 28:02.214
I'll join you after I finish up
with some work here.

28:02.314 --> 28:03.716
What do you say?

28:03.816 --> 28:05.051
No.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.054
Carla, please.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.289
This is a really--

28:10.389 --> 28:12.391
This is a really tough time
for all of us.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.526
Well, I can't just
take off of work, Avery,

28:14.626 --> 28:16.528
and just pull Emily
out of town again.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.198
Well, I've already booked it,

28:19.298 --> 28:21.300
and it is
a non-refundable deposit, so--

28:21.400 --> 28:24.036
Well, that is not my problem.

28:26.572 --> 28:29.141
Please, Carla.

28:29.241 --> 28:31.110
I'm really trying here.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.880
Harder than you realize.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.283
This is gonna go the way
it's gonna go, Avery.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.051
You lied to me.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.333
- I see it.
- Right there.

28:54.433 --> 28:55.601
- I guess I see it.
- Morning!

28:56.769 --> 28:58.337
- Hey!
- Hey.

28:58.437 --> 28:59.939
We didn't scare you away.

29:00.039 --> 29:02.574
Not yet.
Even brought some doughnuts.

29:02.674 --> 29:05.477
Not to stereotype or anything.
'Cause cops.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.479
Oh, uh, are we cops?

29:07.579 --> 29:09.748
Not that I remember, but
if they're glazed, I'm cool.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.855
So, is there anything new

29:15.955 --> 29:17.423
on the Bleeding Heart Murder?

29:17.523 --> 29:19.191
Hm.

29:19.291 --> 29:23.095
It's a cold case with no direct
connection to the guy we found.

29:23.195 --> 29:26.265
Still looking for a link in the
evidence logs from the cabin.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.500
Oh, cool idea.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.303
Maybe the guy had some
other keepsakes up there.

29:31.403 --> 29:34.974
- Go on.
- I mean, my mom still keeps

29:35.074 --> 29:37.209
her old wedding dresses
hanging up in her closet.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.011
Yes, plural.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.648
Something I've learned about
relationships from my podcast--

29:42.748 --> 29:45.517
people keep sentimental things
in sentimental places.

29:50.589 --> 29:51.991
Maybe I missed something.

30:19.085 --> 30:21.020
Sunny.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.189
- We've been over this.
- I don't care.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.858
He's my boy,
and I want to see him.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.759
Well.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.529
You'd be giving us up.
And you made a promise.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.731
I'm his mother!
He needs me!

30:32.831 --> 30:35.334
And you don't get to
tell me what to do!

30:38.537 --> 30:39.906
Cormac.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.340
What is this, huh?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.109
What were you doing
at the diner?

30:44.877 --> 30:46.278
What are you talking about?

30:46.378 --> 30:48.547
Ask her.
Meeting Tonya and Donno.

30:48.647 --> 30:52.051
Somebody mind telling me
what's going on here?

30:52.151 --> 30:53.252
I went to see them.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.254
What for?

30:55.354 --> 30:57.589
'Cause I wanted to know what
happened to Luke and Paige.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.126
Son, will you give us a minute?
I need to talk to your mother.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.727
I'm not going anywhere.

31:01.827 --> 31:05.197
Mom, I'm only gonna ask you
this one more time.

31:05.297 --> 31:08.434
And this time, I'd like you
to be honest with me.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.103
- Now, son, I told you--
- The guy in the cabin.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.439
I have an idea who he is,

31:13.539 --> 31:16.075
but I need to hear you say it.

31:16.175 --> 31:19.078
I know he's not my cousin Bryan.

31:19.178 --> 31:20.746
Who is he?

31:21.613 --> 31:22.915
Tell him, Sunny.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.317
We might as well lance
this poisonous boil

31:25.417 --> 31:26.885
so we can get back to normal.

31:30.722 --> 31:31.890
Okay.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.294
His name's Walter.

31:37.930 --> 31:38.998
He's your brother.

31:46.805 --> 31:48.907
He's not yours.

31:49.008 --> 31:52.278
God, no. No.
He's not.

31:52.378 --> 31:53.912
But I knew.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.948
Then who?

31:58.084 --> 32:00.352
A man passing through town.

32:00.452 --> 32:03.489
I was young.
I made a mistake.

32:03.589 --> 32:06.658
And I've been living with
that mistake for a long time.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.427
I tried to raise him
on my own.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.097
I tried. I really did.
But I couldn't.

32:11.197 --> 32:15.968
I left him at the church.
Safe surrender.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.770
I couldn't imagine
a colder, sadder place

32:18.870 --> 32:21.273
for a little baby to be
than in my arms.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.775
If you gave him up,
why is he here?

32:25.177 --> 32:30.049
Tell him, Sunny.
Just... tell him everything.

32:39.458 --> 32:44.530
Walter wound up with a family
that treated him really bad.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.533
They hurt him.

32:47.633 --> 32:51.370
I had a second chance to give
him what I never could before.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.639
I was gonna be a mother to him.

32:53.739 --> 32:56.075
So I hid him away.

32:56.175 --> 32:59.145
And at least I gave him
a safe place to call home.

32:59.245 --> 33:00.912
I protected him!

33:01.013 --> 33:03.749
I have a brother.

33:04.983 --> 33:08.087
And you've lied to me
all these years.

33:08.187 --> 33:09.221
Yes, you do.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.324
Yes, I did. I know that.

33:12.424 --> 33:15.194
I was wrong.

33:15.294 --> 33:16.928
But I did it for a reason.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.864
They think he killed
those people, right?

33:18.964 --> 33:22.501
Yeah, they think he did, but
I don't think that's the truth.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.104
He confessed to it, and
they found blood in his cabin.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.738
That was the backpacker's blood.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.374
It was Paige's blood.

33:28.474 --> 33:29.508
What?

33:29.608 --> 33:30.742
Cassie told me.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.578
Maybe now you'll believe me.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.380
Walter did it, Sunny.

33:34.480 --> 33:38.950
You just need to accept it and
figure out a way to say goodbye.

33:39.051 --> 33:40.519
You got what you wanted, son.

33:40.619 --> 33:44.356
Now, I'm begging you--
do not blow up this family.

33:44.456 --> 33:47.393
We spent damn near 20 years
covering this secret.

33:47.493 --> 33:50.062
Don't make it for nothing.

33:50.162 --> 33:51.697
He's a killer.

33:51.797 --> 33:54.066
You've-- You've
let him roam free.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.368
People would be alive
if it weren't for you.

33:56.468 --> 34:00.206
Whatever we did, it's over.

34:00.306 --> 34:01.873
Nothing we can take back, son.

34:01.973 --> 34:03.309
Nothing.

34:04.876 --> 34:08.747
Most of life's about what
you're willing to live with.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.568
Evening, Frank.

34:29.668 --> 34:31.903
I was worried the cops would've
picked you clean by now.

34:33.305 --> 34:36.007
They found a bunch of
stolen cash and jewelry.

34:36.108 --> 34:38.244
Mentioned the theft accusations
from last season.

34:38.344 --> 34:41.813
I know what you've been doing,
Coop, with Brett and my son.

34:41.913 --> 34:42.848
Frank, I don't know
what you--

34:42.948 --> 34:44.583
You gotta read me in here.

34:47.819 --> 34:50.156
I need you to be honest with me.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.492
Did you kill Brett?

34:56.094 --> 34:59.131
Brett was a liability,
a disloyal loose end.

34:59.231 --> 35:00.466
What about my son?

35:02.434 --> 35:04.035
Your son died in a fire,

35:04.136 --> 35:06.772
and it was all Brett's fault.

35:06.872 --> 35:09.641
I did us both a favor
by killing him.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.943
You know what I think?

35:12.043 --> 35:13.812
I think my boy
had a change of heart

35:13.912 --> 35:15.547
and went against you
and your little plan.

35:15.647 --> 35:18.317
And I think you killed him
up there to keep his mouth shut!

35:18.417 --> 35:21.220
- No, Frank, no.
- I know. And so do they.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.789
What the hell did you do, Frank?

35:23.889 --> 35:25.491
Are you wearing a wire?

35:25.591 --> 35:27.125
He's burned.
We gotta move.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.195
All units, we're moving in.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.398
- Frank!
- Hey!

35:32.498 --> 35:34.333
You killed my son!

35:35.767 --> 35:37.836
Stop it.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.238
Stop.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.240
We could've finished
this last night,

35:41.340 --> 35:45.244
but you had to go back
for the stolen goods, huh?

35:45.344 --> 35:47.379
Help me.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.886
He killed my son.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.588
I know.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.191
Come on.

36:59.851 --> 37:02.087
Goodbye, my sweet boy.

37:02.187 --> 37:04.823
Lord, please take care of him.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.963
Hello?

37:49.935 --> 37:52.037
Hello?

37:54.540 --> 37:55.774
Anybody here?

38:04.916 --> 38:05.951
Hello?

38:35.914 --> 38:37.916
What the hell is this?

38:44.590 --> 38:47.493
Oh! You just missed
the shooting star!

38:47.593 --> 38:48.727
Here you go.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.261
Nice. Thank you.

38:50.362 --> 38:52.398
Yeah. One of many.

38:53.532 --> 38:54.833
You okay?

38:59.371 --> 39:01.106
I was just thinking about today.

39:02.207 --> 39:04.209
You know, Frank would've
done anything for his son.

39:04.309 --> 39:07.012
I mean anything.
No matter what.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.615
I would do anything for mine.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.517
And you would do anything
for Emily.

39:11.617 --> 39:14.052
Yeah, that's just it.

39:14.152 --> 39:16.588
It just doesn't feel like
I'm there for her.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.090
She found a dead body, Jenny.

39:19.190 --> 39:23.294
And that stepfather of hers
is... questionable at best.

39:23.395 --> 39:26.064
And I just-- I don't-- I don't
know what to do about it.

39:26.164 --> 39:27.633
I don't like that.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.238
Emily's a good kid.

39:33.338 --> 39:35.574
She's strong.

39:35.674 --> 39:38.710
She is strong because you
and Carla taught her to be.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.211
Just...

39:41.747 --> 39:43.314
...give yourself a break.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.885
For movie night.
At least.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.253
Yeah. All right.

39:48.353 --> 39:49.821
Cheers.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.823
Speaking of, where is Cassie?
Did she get lost?

39:51.923 --> 39:53.659
Uh, I don't know.

39:53.759 --> 39:56.294
She could be distracted
by a certain someone.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.897
Who? Cormac? Ooh!

39:58.997 --> 40:00.466
You got some juicy details
you want to share?

40:00.566 --> 40:02.501
Ooh. I don't know.
Are we jealous?

40:02.601 --> 40:03.969
No, but interested.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.136
What's happening?

40:05.236 --> 40:08.106
- Oh, speak of the devil.
- Hey.

40:08.206 --> 40:10.141
How'd it go
with our mystery man?

40:10.241 --> 40:12.277
It's not a mystery anymore.

40:12.377 --> 40:14.580
What?

40:17.348 --> 40:19.017
His name's Walter.
