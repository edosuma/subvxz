00:01.000 --> 00:03.702
<i>Previously on pretty little liars... I've
gotten careful, em. Really good at this.</i>

00:08.146 --> 00:10.327
<i>She was driving that night, guys.
I remembered.</i>

00:10.506 --> 00:13.341
You have to promise not to tell.
That you can see?

00:13.376 --> 00:16.478
I am still a target. You owe it to me.
All of you!

00:19.348 --> 00:23.318
My mom was in a car accident. She felt like
someone was trying to run her off the road.

00:23.352 --> 00:24.553
Are you Emily fields?

00:24.587 --> 00:26.655
Yes.
I'm Maya's cousin Nate.

00:26.689 --> 00:29.291
What was my mother doing here?
I can't talk.

00:29.325 --> 00:30.692
My new attorney
made me promise.

00:30.726 --> 00:33.528
It's Lucas. What is he
doing out so late? Shh!

00:33.563 --> 00:35.664
There's no more "a,"
so why are you lying to me now?

00:35.698 --> 00:39.434
I feel like I only exist in half of your life.
I'm done, Hanna.

00:39.469 --> 00:40.663
What do you think
Mona said to wilden?

00:40.783 --> 00:44.410
If she knows that we were at Ali's grave
that night... we would be in jail right now.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.747
I thought Hanna was
joining us for dinner.

00:52.782 --> 00:54.783
Hanna hasn't eaten
since Tuesday.

00:54.817 --> 00:57.319
Should we grab a pizza
and go over there?

00:57.353 --> 00:58.753
No unless the topping is Caleb.

00:58.788 --> 01:02.257
If you guys want to to see her,
can you just go without me?

01:02.291 --> 01:05.393
I already feel bad enough that
I convinced her to tell Caleb.

01:05.428 --> 01:08.263
With or without you
she was backed into a corner.

01:08.297 --> 01:10.565
This "A" does not feel like a
high school girl playing games.

01:10.600 --> 01:14.636
Well, if you figure out those
rules, can you tell the rest of us?

01:14.670 --> 01:17.539
You know what? I'm not really hungry.
Me either.

01:17.573 --> 01:19.407
My stomach's in a knot.

01:19.442 --> 01:20.675
So's my neck.

01:20.710 --> 01:22.644
I haven't been able
to brush the back of my head

01:22.678 --> 01:24.613
in, like, a year and a half.
Spence,

01:24.647 --> 01:26.481
don't let en freak you out.

01:26.516 --> 01:29.451
If the police really knew that we
were lying about the lake house...

01:29.485 --> 01:32.320
not just the lake house. What about
the negatives of that picture,

01:32.355 --> 01:34.456
Ali's missing body, all the
things we buried with her...

01:34.490 --> 01:36.291
any of that could
get us arrested.

01:36.325 --> 01:38.360
It's my neck again.

01:50.473 --> 01:52.474
Are they going to Jenna's?
Garrett's.

01:52.508 --> 01:56.578
Well, who else lives in his
house besides his parents?

01:56.612 --> 01:58.647
I don't think they've been
outside since he was arrested.

01:58.681 --> 02:02.350
Having a son in jail for two
murders might keep you indoors.

02:08.657 --> 02:12.561
That's his mom.
That's Mrs. Reynolds.

02:18.734 --> 02:20.569
You guys.
What? What is it?

02:20.603 --> 02:22.537
What? What?
Over there.

02:22.572 --> 02:25.473
There was a hoodie watching.

02:25.508 --> 02:27.709
What are you saying? You think
"A" was out here watching us?

02:27.743 --> 02:30.645
Are you sure? Why would "A"
care about Garrett's mother?

02:30.680 --> 02:34.282
Maybe "A" wanted her
out of the house.

02:36.652 --> 02:39.487
<i># Got a secret</i>
<i>can you keep it #</i>

02:39.522 --> 02:42.290
<i># swear this one you'll save</i>

02:42.325 --> 02:44.492
<i># better lock it</i>
<i>in your pocket #</i>

02:44.527 --> 02:47.362
<i># taking this one</i>
<i>to the grave #</i>

02:47.396 --> 02:52.300
<i># if I show you then I'll know</i>
<i>you won't tell what I said #</i>

02:52.335 --> 02:54.536
<i># 'cause two can</i>
<i>keep a secret #</i>

02:54.570 --> 02:57.372
<i># if one of them is dead</i>

03:00.543 --> 03:02.611
here's your bright-eye.

03:02.645 --> 03:05.513
Oh. Thank you.

03:05.548 --> 03:08.516
And the world's biggest bear claw.
What's in here?

03:08.551 --> 03:11.353
They had that Turkey baguette
on the menu that you love.

03:11.387 --> 03:13.255
You got me two of them.

03:13.289 --> 03:15.624
And... Roasted veggies
and pickles.

03:15.658 --> 03:17.425
Pickles come with.

03:17.460 --> 03:18.660
Ah. Well, let me...

03:18.694 --> 03:20.528
oh, no.
It's my treat.

03:20.563 --> 03:23.398
What? You'll have
something for later.

03:24.533 --> 03:27.469
Okay, you have one lime
in your fridge. One.

03:27.503 --> 03:29.437
And it's growing fur.

03:29.472 --> 03:31.239
Thank you, I appreciate it,

03:31.274 --> 03:32.641
but you don't have to feed me.

03:32.675 --> 03:35.543
I have my savings,
my tutoring gigs...

03:35.578 --> 03:37.679
I'm fine. Really.
It's just a Turkey...

03:37.713 --> 03:39.614
it's not necessary.

03:39.649 --> 03:42.550
I have to get going.
I have an interview at 8:30.

03:55.298 --> 03:57.332
Hey!

03:57.366 --> 03:59.467
Hello? Still want a ride?
Yeah.

03:59.502 --> 04:01.670
Please, just
give me back my stuff!

04:16.652 --> 04:18.386
Paige?

04:20.488 --> 04:22.457
Hey, Emily. What's up?

04:22.491 --> 04:24.359
I've been meaning to call you.

04:24.393 --> 04:26.494
You have? Why?

04:26.529 --> 04:28.496
I was wondering if you
were free tomorrow night.

04:28.531 --> 04:31.666
For? I got tickets to see
the Katy Perry movie.

04:31.701 --> 04:35.437
Hanna's a big fan,
other stuff going on. Ot

04:35.471 --> 04:37.472
boy stuff.
Oh.

04:37.506 --> 04:40.442
Come on, a behind-the-scenes
look at miss firework.

04:40.476 --> 04:41.710
Don't you want to know
what makes her sizzle?

04:41.744 --> 04:43.745
It'll l be fun. You in?

04:45.648 --> 04:47.415
I guess.

04:47.450 --> 04:48.683
I haven't heard from you since...

04:48.718 --> 04:51.353
I know. I've had a ton
of makeup tests to do,

04:51.387 --> 04:52.787
and senior year's been
kicking my butt.

04:55.424 --> 04:57.325
If you don't want to go...
no, I do.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.693
That's not it.

04:58.728 --> 05:00.662
I just thought
you were avoiding me.

05:00.696 --> 05:03.531
I wasn't avoiding you.

05:03.566 --> 05:06.701
M-maybe I was,
but not intentionally.

05:06.736 --> 05:09.537
I've just been
going through a lot

05:09.572 --> 05:11.606
and needed to figure
some stuff out.

05:14.310 --> 05:15.643
Okay. Let's do it.

05:15.678 --> 05:18.279
Fresh start, right?
Yeah.

05:18.314 --> 05:20.548
You said tomorrow night?

05:24.587 --> 05:26.421
You haven't heard?

05:26.455 --> 05:29.424
She had more surgery
before school.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.526
She can see again.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.362
I'm happy for her.
It's pretty amazing.

05:34.397 --> 05:37.565
Mrs. Welch was slobbering
all over her in the parking lot.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.335
Text me deets about Katy Perry.

05:40.369 --> 05:41.736
See you tomorrow.

05:44.607 --> 05:47.642
Congratulations.
Thanks.

05:47.676 --> 05:49.744
Yeah, we're just gonna...

05:56.552 --> 05:59.287
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

05:59.321 --> 06:00.655
What are <i>you still doing here?</i>

06:00.689 --> 06:02.590
I'm the mother.
I get an answer first.

06:02.625 --> 06:06.428
I don't feel well.

06:10.733 --> 06:13.301
Have you heard from Caleb?

06:14.570 --> 06:16.504
Do we know how his mother is?

06:16.539 --> 06:19.607
I would if he'd respond
to my texts.

06:19.642 --> 06:22.610
Listen, I know you two
left things unresolved.

06:22.645 --> 06:25.480
It's resolved.
He left me.

06:27.750 --> 06:31.319
Hanna, that's just
for right now.

06:31.353 --> 06:34.722
Okay? You don't know
what the future might hold.

06:34.757 --> 06:37.492
But the future's not gonna
hold much of anything

06:37.526 --> 06:40.528
if you don't get an education.
You need to go to school.

06:44.733 --> 06:47.368
Do you have plans tomorrow?

06:47.403 --> 06:49.304
Uh... Yeah.

06:49.338 --> 06:53.274
I'm going to listen to every sad song
I've ever downloaded, on repeat.

06:53.309 --> 06:56.377
My boss volunteered
the bank staff to help out

06:56.412 --> 06:58.313
at a rummage sale
at the church.

06:58.347 --> 07:00.281
We're still short
a couple of people.

07:00.316 --> 07:02.617
Oh, no, please don't.
It'll be fun.

07:02.651 --> 07:05.553
You can help sort the clothes.
You love clothes. <i>New</i> clothes.

07:05.588 --> 07:07.655
Really?

07:11.427 --> 07:14.395
Fine. Send me to church.

07:15.698 --> 07:17.699
Hanna.

07:17.733 --> 07:20.435
Gonna go to school
wearing that?

07:20.469 --> 07:22.704
Whatever.

07:22.738 --> 07:24.472
Right.

07:38.754 --> 07:41.489
What happened to
keeping a low profile?

07:41.524 --> 07:43.458
Staying blind
because she's a target?

07:43.492 --> 07:45.426
Look at her.
How can you miss her?

07:45.461 --> 07:48.329
She's been gliding around school
all day like a Thanksgiving float.

07:48.364 --> 07:50.331
We should say something to her.
No. Wait.

07:50.366 --> 07:54.402
Did you get Aria's text about Lucas and the photo studio?
Yeah. What was that about?

07:54.436 --> 07:57.305
Aria says that she knows the
photographer who owns the studio,

07:57.339 --> 08:00.275
and it's on the same block where she
and Hanna saw Lucas on that night.

08:00.309 --> 08:02.610
So now we think Lucas took
the photos in the graveyard?

08:02.645 --> 08:05.413
Well, maybe, but then why was
he pounding to get in there?

08:05.447 --> 08:08.383
I can't think about this now.
I have a calculus test.

08:08.417 --> 08:10.552
Wait, em.
There's something else.

08:10.586 --> 08:15.223
My mom left her tablet
out on the table this morning.

08:15.257 --> 08:18.259
What is this?
They're letting Garrett out.

08:18.294 --> 08:21.629
To see his mother. It's called
compassionate furlough.

08:21.664 --> 08:24.599
What has he done to deserve compassion?
She's probably really sick.

08:24.633 --> 08:27.435
So basically they're giving him
a get-out-of-jail-free card?

08:27.469 --> 08:31.606
This just might be his last time to say goodbye to her.
At least he <i>gets</i> a chance.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.243
Do you want to talk about this later?
What's there to talk about?

08:35.277 --> 08:37.544
We have no power... who
cares what we think? I do.

08:37.580 --> 08:41.448
What if "A" put Garrett's mom in the
hospital to get Garrett out of jail?

08:41.482 --> 08:45.253
Maybe the plan is to meet up with the
person who's really helping him.

08:45.287 --> 08:48.489
It would explain what Aria saw
hiding in the shadows last night.

08:48.524 --> 08:52.694
Em, Mona might not be the only person
in rosewood who owns a black hoodie.

08:52.728 --> 08:55.463
Don't look. She's coming over here.
Who?

08:55.497 --> 08:58.266
The float. She's carrying
something. Envelopes.

08:58.300 --> 09:01.202
What's in them?
Anthrax.

09:01.236 --> 09:04.639
Hi. Here's one for you,
and one for you.

09:04.673 --> 09:07.542
I haven't seen Aria or Hanna. Can
I trust that you'll pass them on?

09:07.576 --> 09:10.578
What is this?
Oh, they're invitations.

09:10.613 --> 09:13.581
It's my birthday. And you
recovered just in time.

09:13.616 --> 09:16.384
The doctors say
it's a positive outcome.

09:16.418 --> 09:19.520
No. What the hell
is <i>this</i> Jenna?

09:19.555 --> 09:22.223
I thought you needed protection.
We had a deal.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.359
Well, this is the new deal:

09:24.393 --> 09:28.463
I feel a lot safer when I'm in
charge of what happens to me.

09:28.497 --> 09:30.398
Hope to see you at the party.

09:42.771 --> 09:44.839
Can you take
a pot of decaf over to the alcove?

09:44.874 --> 09:47.509
Oh, and please tell me
you're free tomorrow night.

09:47.543 --> 09:48.710
Why?

09:51.947 --> 09:53.882
The guest list keeps expanding,

09:53.916 --> 09:55.884
so might need you to work
this birthday party.

09:55.918 --> 09:58.486
Well, I can't, because
I'm on the guest list.

09:58.521 --> 10:01.489
Oh. That's perfect. You're
already gonna be here anyway.

10:01.524 --> 10:03.758
How often do you get paid
to go to a party?

10:03.792 --> 10:05.860
But I wasn't gonna come
because I have other plans.

10:05.895 --> 10:09.664
Well, they better include showing
up here and keeping your job.

10:13.903 --> 10:17.639
I thought I put the
quinceanera photos in this book.

10:17.673 --> 10:18.973
I need a sherpa.

10:19.008 --> 10:21.609
Oh. Thanks, Emily.
Have you met Laurel?

10:21.644 --> 10:22.877
She's taking the pictures
at my party.

10:22.912 --> 10:25.647
Laurel tuchman,
this is Emily fields.

10:25.681 --> 10:27.916
We are...
Friends from school.

10:27.950 --> 10:29.951
Cool. Listen,
I'm sorry for the mess,

10:29.985 --> 10:33.521
I always take up extra space.

10:33.556 --> 10:36.558
Oh, no, no. Any more caffeine and
my hair will straighten itself.

10:36.592 --> 10:39.527
This is decaf.
Oh, well, then pour away.

10:39.562 --> 10:43.631
Emily, would you mind just closing
the curtain a little bit?

10:43.666 --> 10:45.633
The light is still too much.

10:45.668 --> 10:47.569
Sure.

10:49.038 --> 10:51.973
Normally I would have had
my assistant send all this over,

10:52.007 --> 10:53.708
but I just got rid of him.

10:53.742 --> 10:55.910
Don't hire a thief.
What happened?

10:55.945 --> 10:57.979
Well, it's a long story.

10:58.013 --> 11:00.582
He was stealing supplies,
developing his own work.

11:00.616 --> 11:03.718
Then he had the nerve to come back
and demand I give him his negatives.

11:03.752 --> 11:05.787
I told him, "listen,
anything you left,

11:05.821 --> 11:07.956
it belongs to me until
you pay me what you owe me."

11:07.990 --> 11:09.824
You know what's
going on, right?

11:09.858 --> 11:11.726
They're letting Garrett out.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.962
He's gonna be free, walking
down the street. Not really.

11:13.996 --> 11:16.631
He'll be handcuffed, Nate.
There'll be a guard with him...

11:16.665 --> 11:17.799
since the court is
gonna be so generous,

11:17.833 --> 11:20.802
how about they grant me
permission to... Nate, stop.

11:20.836 --> 11:23.605
Why aren't you angry?

11:23.639 --> 11:25.707
I was. I am.

11:25.741 --> 11:28.710
Look, I know he took away
someone we both love,

11:28.744 --> 11:30.778
but he's about to lose
someone he loves, too.

11:30.813 --> 11:32.547
So what?

11:32.581 --> 11:35.683
He doesn't deserve to see the
sky or breathe fresh air again.

11:35.718 --> 11:37.885
I <i>kn</i> i'm with you on this, okay?

11:37.920 --> 11:41.689
But you have to let things play
out the way they're meant to be.

11:43.559 --> 11:45.526
I'm on the clock,
I have to get back to work.

11:45.561 --> 11:47.862
Can you just
hang out here for a bit?

12:00.676 --> 12:02.810
<i>You bought him groceries?</i>

12:02.845 --> 12:04.712
It was not groceries.
It was two sandwiches.

12:04.747 --> 12:06.648
And believe me,
I'm still paying for it.

12:06.682 --> 12:07.915
You should have seen
the look he gave me.

12:07.950 --> 12:10.652
Well, he's your boyfriend,
Aria, he's not a baby squirrel.

12:10.686 --> 12:13.454
Just trying to do the right thing.
Totally wrong.

12:13.489 --> 12:14.889
I've been there, done that.

12:14.923 --> 12:18.593
Every time you baby-squirrel ezra
you're taking away his nuts.

12:18.627 --> 12:20.662
You did not just say that.

12:20.696 --> 12:24.632
I did. But I don't think
that I meant to.

12:24.667 --> 12:27.669
Is that Emily?

12:27.703 --> 12:30.838
Ezra.
Did he find his nuts?

12:30.873 --> 12:32.874
Ha.

12:32.908 --> 12:36.544
He just got an invitation
to Jenna's birthday party.

12:36.578 --> 12:38.846
Wait. Now <i>Fitz</i> is invited?

12:38.881 --> 12:43.718
Yeah. Apparently Jenna wants to see her
favorite teacher for the first time.

12:43.752 --> 12:47.922
What the hell is she up to?

12:47.956 --> 12:51.492
Spencer, how are you able to
write a paper during all this?

12:51.527 --> 12:53.861
I'm not. I'm breaking and entering
into my mom's email account.

12:53.896 --> 12:57.532
Why? Because I want to see what
time Garrett's being released.

12:57.566 --> 12:59.867
You want to stand outside
the hospital and protest?

12:59.902 --> 13:03.671
No. I want to be inside, so I
can see who he's <i>real</i> visiting.

13:03.706 --> 13:05.807
And my guess is that face
is gonna be a lot easier to read

13:05.841 --> 13:08.776
under hospital lights
than a street lamp.

13:10.946 --> 13:13.848
Okay, great. Thanks.

13:13.882 --> 13:17.719
They said we could use the Katy Perry
movie tickets next weekend instead.

13:17.753 --> 13:20.621
I'm so embarrassed. I invite you to
do something, and then I cancel.

13:20.656 --> 13:23.558
I'm sure it will be
just as fun in seven days.

13:23.592 --> 13:26.494
Besides, I get to see you
tomorrow night anyway.

13:26.528 --> 13:28.730
Yeah. Wearing this.

13:28.764 --> 13:31.666
You bought a clip-on tie?

13:31.700 --> 13:34.669
Kevin said the birthday girl
was set on a certain look.

13:34.703 --> 13:36.838
Fourth grade student council?

13:41.543 --> 13:44.612
I'm not even sure how this works.
Can I help?

13:54.590 --> 13:56.524
This is harder than it looks.

13:58.894 --> 14:00.561
You know what,
this is too short.

14:00.596 --> 14:03.498
I have a real tie that I wore
to a costume party.

14:03.532 --> 14:05.833
Can you check that cabinet
and see if it's in there?

14:05.868 --> 14:07.568
Sure.

14:12.474 --> 14:15.543
So, were you surprised that
Jenna invited you to this?

14:15.577 --> 14:18.746
Kind of.
We're not exactly chummy.

14:18.781 --> 14:22.583
We were lab partners once,
but she sorta scared me.

14:26.622 --> 14:27.889
Is this yours?

14:27.923 --> 14:29.824
What?

14:31.794 --> 14:34.695
Careful, em.
They're already pretty strong.

14:37.766 --> 14:40.802
Oh, yeah. I...
I forgot that was in there.

14:40.836 --> 14:43.671
It's nice.
It's a mistake.

14:43.705 --> 14:46.707
I meant to toss it, but I was afraid
my mom would find it in the garbage.

14:46.742 --> 14:49.677
There's still something in it.
Paige,

14:49.711 --> 14:51.579
if you want it, it's yours.

14:51.613 --> 14:53.781
Really. I'm done with that.

15:01.623 --> 15:04.759
You sure you don't need a lift?
It's not out of the way.

15:04.793 --> 15:07.795
No, I'm good. I still have a few
things to take care of here.

15:07.830 --> 15:09.630
I will see you tomorrow.

15:09.665 --> 15:12.733
Hmm. Must be great
to say that and mean it.

15:12.768 --> 15:14.669
Take care.
Thanks.

15:21.944 --> 15:24.645
That's beautiful.

15:24.680 --> 15:25.813
Thanks.

15:28.684 --> 15:31.485
Are you
an architecture student?

15:32.654 --> 15:34.755
We'll see.
Maybe someday.

15:34.790 --> 15:38.893
Do you ever...
Draw people?

15:38.927 --> 15:41.529
I have.

15:41.563 --> 15:44.866
But, uh, tend to look
more like buildings.

15:47.502 --> 15:49.871
Well, I'm impressed.

15:53.775 --> 15:57.545
Well, where is my invitation?
I want to at least see it.

15:57.579 --> 15:59.513
Are you coming from yoga?
No, home.

15:59.548 --> 16:01.849
Why are you dressed like that?
Because, Spencer,

16:01.884 --> 16:05.753
I'm too depressed to work a
zipper, all right? Get over it.

16:05.787 --> 16:07.555
Who's she talking to?

16:07.589 --> 16:09.624
Emily, who apparently
has to work Jenna's party.

16:09.658 --> 16:11.525
Seriously?

16:11.560 --> 16:13.828
Well, I can beat that.

16:13.862 --> 16:18.799
I have to spend my Saturday night sorting
out velour track suits at church.

16:18.834 --> 16:21.769
Why? My mom found out
that I cut school,

16:21.803 --> 16:24.405
and now she signed me up
for a triple shift.

16:24.439 --> 16:27.575
If you thought
I was depressed before...

16:27.609 --> 16:29.777
It gets weirder.
What's up?

16:29.811 --> 16:31.445
Hey, han, how are you feeling?

16:31.480 --> 16:33.714
I don't think
I've seen you in sweats...

16:33.749 --> 16:36.651
she can't work a zipper. Just move on.
What did Emily say?

16:36.685 --> 16:39.520
So, Paige is invited
to the party too,

16:39.554 --> 16:42.423
and now Laurel tuchman is shooting it.
Laura tucks-what?

16:42.457 --> 16:43.691
Laurel. Tuchman.

16:43.725 --> 16:45.559
The photographer that I took
a class from last summer.

16:45.594 --> 16:48.429
Go on.
Well, Emily may have overheard

16:48.463 --> 16:50.765
why Lucas was banging
on that door.

16:50.799 --> 16:54.769
Laurel fired her assistant because he was
using the studio to develop his own prints.

16:54.803 --> 16:56.570
And now he wants the negatives.

16:56.605 --> 16:58.606
Where are you going with this?

16:58.640 --> 17:01.475
To an open grave
that he took pictures of.

17:01.510 --> 17:04.612
And you think Lucas
dug it up by himself?

17:04.646 --> 17:07.415
The kid can barely lift
his chemistry book.

17:07.449 --> 17:09.583
Well, he's tall enough to reach
the pedals on a backhoe.

17:09.617 --> 17:11.419
Let's just stay with Jenna,
all right?

17:11.453 --> 17:13.654
That's who Emily remembers
driving that car that night.

17:13.689 --> 17:15.756
Why can't she be it?
They can <i>all</i> be it.

17:15.790 --> 17:17.491
Spencer's right.

17:17.526 --> 17:20.428
Why is Garrett being released
the same night of Jenna's party?

17:20.462 --> 17:22.797
Exactly. What is
the purpose of this party?

17:22.830 --> 17:24.732
Is it really to celebrate
Jenna's birthday,

17:24.766 --> 17:26.567
or is it just to get us
all in the same room

17:26.601 --> 17:28.502
so she can drop
a vat of pig blood on us?

17:28.537 --> 17:29.804
She's not dropping
anything on me.

17:29.838 --> 17:31.672
I won't be there.
No one will.

17:31.707 --> 17:34.408
Who wants to go to
that stupid party anyways?

17:34.443 --> 17:36.644
Me.

17:47.462 --> 17:48.696
Oh! Am I done?

17:48.730 --> 17:50.364
You've been here
barely an hour.

17:50.399 --> 17:51.732
That can't be true.

17:51.767 --> 17:54.535
Just think of it as
the school day you missed.

17:54.569 --> 17:56.404
Have you eaten anything?
No.

17:56.438 --> 17:59.540
That bra over there
kind of put me off my feed.

17:59.574 --> 18:02.676
They just put some food out.
I'll see what I can find you.

18:11.386 --> 18:12.686
I can't vouch
for the egg salad,

18:12.721 --> 18:16.424
Four stars.

18:16.458 --> 18:18.659
Hmm.
Thanks for the tip.

18:18.693 --> 18:21.662
Here.
Thanks.

18:21.696 --> 18:23.464
You on your way out?

18:23.498 --> 18:27.301
I finished my shift earlier. I just
came back to check on my daughter.

18:27.335 --> 18:28.502
Who's your daughter?

18:28.537 --> 18:31.572
Hanna marin.
She's sorting clothes.

18:31.606 --> 18:34.475
Oh, right. Yeah. She's a
terrific worker. Yeah.

18:36.511 --> 18:39.413
Um, maybe I'm thinking
of somebody else.

18:39.448 --> 18:41.415
Yeah, maybe I am too.

18:41.450 --> 18:44.485
You're with the group from
the bank, right? I am.

18:44.519 --> 18:47.521
Yeah, this is an important
cause for my boss.

18:47.556 --> 18:49.557
We volunteer every year.

18:49.591 --> 18:52.726
Well, we're grateful to have
as many hands as possible.

18:52.761 --> 18:57.598
I'm still new here, so just
trying to get acquainted.

18:57.632 --> 19:01.569
Well, you're name-tag
says "volunteer coordinator."

19:01.603 --> 19:05.639
That's more than acquainted;
That's committed... Ted.

19:05.674 --> 19:08.642
Jumpin' in with both feet,
I guess.

19:08.677 --> 19:12.346
Good way to meet people...
Ashley.

19:12.380 --> 19:15.216
So is splitting a cookie
with a stranger.

19:15.250 --> 19:18.552
We're not strangers...
we split a cookie.

19:21.356 --> 19:23.657
What does that make us
if we split another?

19:23.692 --> 19:25.459
Married?

19:27.362 --> 19:29.530
Not yet, but I will.

19:29.564 --> 19:32.299
If I can just bump into her,
I will get some answers

19:32.334 --> 19:34.235
about what Lucas was
really doing in that studio.

19:34.269 --> 19:35.569
Spence, I gotta go.

19:35.604 --> 19:37.271
What are you doing?

19:37.305 --> 19:39.406
You leave my lime alone.

19:39.441 --> 19:42.576
I was just going to pet it.
You could do that,

19:42.611 --> 19:46.280
or we could head over to new
hope and hang out before dinner.

19:46.314 --> 19:48.616
We're going to dinner in new hope?
Yeah, is that a problem?

19:48.650 --> 19:50.684
No... No.

19:50.719 --> 19:55.389
I just thought that we would go somewhere
around here so we could stop by Jenna's party.

19:55.423 --> 19:57.258
I thought
I mentioned that to you.

19:57.292 --> 20:00.294
You did, but I... I didn't
think you were serious.

20:00.328 --> 20:02.496
I don't have to go to that
party, and neither do you.

20:02.531 --> 20:05.466
I know I don't,
but I'd like to.

20:05.500 --> 20:09.270
Really? Given
your history with her?

20:09.304 --> 20:11.372
History.

20:11.406 --> 20:13.674
You were the first one
to say that, anyway.

20:13.708 --> 20:16.644
Look, it's incredible
what she's gone through,

20:16.678 --> 20:19.647
and if she wants to
include me... us...

20:19.681 --> 20:23.350
it's the least we can do
to be there.

20:26.388 --> 20:27.588
That's it. I can't wait.

20:27.622 --> 20:30.324
Wait for what?

20:31.593 --> 20:33.527
This.

20:34.729 --> 20:36.630
Open it.

20:43.572 --> 20:46.273
They don't make
these cameras anymore,

20:46.308 --> 20:50.277
and it's kind of indestructible,
so it probably still works.

20:50.312 --> 20:52.580
But...
but nothing.

20:55.350 --> 20:56.717
You're welcome.

21:01.723 --> 21:03.490
Thank you.

21:10.332 --> 21:13.400
Come on.
Let's go to a party.

21:24.346 --> 21:26.380
Okay,
so he's finally

21:26.414 --> 21:29.516
chosen some flowers,
which are hideous and tacky

21:29.551 --> 21:31.385
and mostly carnations,

21:31.419 --> 21:33.254
but there's not really
much selection around here.

21:33.288 --> 21:34.555
Is he handcuffed at least?

21:34.589 --> 21:36.657
<i>Yeah. And he has</i>
<i>two guards with him.</i>

21:38.360 --> 21:41.295
Hold on.
<i>What's happening?</i>

21:41.329 --> 21:44.598
He's writing a note
for the flowers.

21:51.573 --> 21:53.340
Why would he be doing that?

21:53.375 --> 21:55.676
So she'll know
who they're from.

21:55.710 --> 21:59.380
His mom is in a coma. She's
not doing a lot of reading.

21:59.414 --> 22:00.547
<i>I gotta go.</i>

22:00.582 --> 22:02.416
Fine.

22:03.618 --> 22:06.320
Uh, I'll call you later.
Bye, dad.

22:06.354 --> 22:08.255
I get it.

22:08.290 --> 22:11.592
He's despicable and he's hurt
people who were close to you.

22:11.626 --> 22:13.727
But his mother's dying.
That's her son.

22:13.762 --> 22:17.665
So two guards weren't enough?
They had to send you too?

22:17.699 --> 22:20.668
I've still got a missing body to find.
It's my job, not yours.

22:20.702 --> 22:23.404
What are you looking for?

22:23.438 --> 22:27.374
I'm just here to pick up
the... Test results

22:27.409 --> 22:29.610
of my field hockey physical.

22:29.644 --> 22:33.681
You know what? You used
to be a much better liar.

23:10.552 --> 23:12.286
Nice tie.

23:12.320 --> 23:15.589
Thanks.
I can't wait to take it off.

23:15.623 --> 23:18.459
When you do, can you wrap it for me?
I forgot to bring a gift.

23:18.493 --> 23:20.294
I'm glad you're here.

23:20.328 --> 23:23.530
I wanted to make sure this night
wasn't a complete bust for you.

23:28.436 --> 23:30.437
Who's that?

23:30.472 --> 23:31.705
Nate.

23:31.740 --> 23:33.640
M-Maya's cousin.

23:36.478 --> 23:38.278
I'll take that.

23:38.313 --> 23:39.780
I'll be right back.

24:15.350 --> 24:18.619
You've been here a while.
You want to take a break?

24:18.653 --> 24:20.421
Can I be done?

24:20.455 --> 24:24.358
You could, but if you're
taking that jacket with you...

24:24.392 --> 24:27.261
Oh. No, I was
gonna buy that.

24:27.295 --> 24:30.330
Here. Do I pay you?
I only have a twenty.

24:30.365 --> 24:32.599
I'll get your receipt.

24:32.634 --> 24:36.670
Wait. Um, do you know where this
last box of clothes came from?

24:36.704 --> 24:38.605
I don't.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.341
Why? Does it matter?

24:41.376 --> 24:43.644
No. I was just curious.

24:52.620 --> 24:56.423
Em, call me. I'm still at the
church, and I just found...

24:58.426 --> 25:01.361
I thought that you and Spencer
got rid of all of your clothes...

25:01.396 --> 25:03.597
the gray jacket
from that night?

25:03.631 --> 25:07.267
It just came out of a donation box.
Why is it here?

25:19.344 --> 25:21.378
Nate. What are you...

25:21.413 --> 25:23.447
I was hoping you were
gonna be working tonight.

25:23.481 --> 25:26.350
Were you invited to this?
Last minute invitation.

25:26.384 --> 25:29.320
I met Jenna here
yesterday afternoon.

25:29.354 --> 25:31.752
I figure it was either come to
this or sit in my empty apartment

25:31.777 --> 25:33.210
and punch holes in the wall.

25:35.306 --> 25:37.507
Truth is, I don't know
how long I'll stay.

25:37.541 --> 25:38.675
I'm not in the mood to party.

25:38.709 --> 25:43.446
But I gotta say,
she's pretty intriguing.

25:43.481 --> 25:46.349
Why?
What did she tell you?

25:46.383 --> 25:49.686
Enough to get me
to buy a new shirt.

25:49.720 --> 25:52.489
I want to know more.
No, you don't.

25:52.523 --> 25:55.425
What does that mean?
Nothing.

25:55.459 --> 25:58.328
I should probably pass these
around before they dry out.

25:58.362 --> 25:59.696
What are those?

25:59.730 --> 26:01.564
Dried out.

26:21.652 --> 26:24.554
Hi!
You made it.

26:24.588 --> 26:28.458
I was... Flattered
for the invitation.

26:28.492 --> 26:30.426
We both were.

26:31.629 --> 26:33.263
Happy Birthday.

26:34.498 --> 26:36.299
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to stare.

26:36.333 --> 26:39.469
I'm just still adjusting and
trying to match faces in reality

26:39.503 --> 26:42.605
to the ones
that I saw in my head.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.375
No, it must be overwhelming.

26:45.409 --> 26:47.243
Is that Laurel tuchman?

26:47.278 --> 26:49.546
She's the photographer
I took a class from last summer.

26:49.580 --> 26:52.282
She's amazing. I didn't want
to leave it to amateurs.

26:52.316 --> 26:56.286
I wanted someone who could
record every single moment.

26:58.322 --> 27:00.523
I'm gonna go say hi.
I'll be right back.

27:00.558 --> 27:03.226
Laurel?
Hey, Aria.

27:03.260 --> 27:05.562
This girl's got some classy friends.
How ya doin'?

27:05.596 --> 27:07.597
I'm good. Yeah,
I'm still taking pictures.

27:07.631 --> 27:12.535
Actually, my boyfriend, he just gave me
this vintage camera. It's a roliflex.

27:12.570 --> 27:15.572
God, nice boyfriend.
When I was I high school.

27:15.606 --> 27:18.208
I couldn't afford
a pinhole and a light bulb.

27:18.242 --> 27:20.510
Oh, he's not in high school.

27:20.544 --> 27:22.545
Are those expensive?

27:22.580 --> 27:26.449
Honey, if it works, he must have
dropped a precious penny on it.

27:26.483 --> 27:29.285
Listen, I'd love to stay and
chat, but I gotta keep snapping.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.486
I'm flying solo.

27:30.521 --> 27:33.523
Are you here alone without an assistant?
Don't ask.

27:33.557 --> 27:35.525
I'm in the market if you know
anyone who's interested.

27:35.559 --> 27:38.194
I'm interested.
Really?

27:38.229 --> 27:40.396
Yeah. Well, call me on Monday.
Hopefully by then

27:40.431 --> 27:42.599
I'll have gotten rid of
what's left of the old one.

27:42.633 --> 27:45.268
Is he still there?
Well, just his camera bag.

27:45.302 --> 27:48.404
I'm holding it hostage till he gets
mommy and daddy to write me a check.

27:53.410 --> 27:55.578
Hey!
Need some help?

27:55.613 --> 27:59.482
I wish, but you can't. My manager
sees me hanging, he'll freak out.

27:59.516 --> 28:03.219
He wasn't upset you were hanging
out with Maya's cousin?

28:03.254 --> 28:04.320
Nate?

28:04.355 --> 28:06.289
No, we weren't hanging out.

28:06.323 --> 28:07.457
We were just...

28:09.193 --> 28:10.426
it's complicated.

28:11.495 --> 28:13.396
Hey!

28:13.430 --> 28:16.432
Hi, Paige.
Hi.

28:16.467 --> 28:19.335
What's up?

28:19.370 --> 28:21.170
Nothing. We'll talk later.

28:21.205 --> 28:22.338
You know, I'm leaving.

28:22.373 --> 28:24.207
I shouldn't really
be back here anyway.

28:24.241 --> 28:25.508
It's a no-friend zone.

28:30.681 --> 28:32.515
What are you looking for?

28:32.549 --> 28:34.417
Laurel's equipment.
She said it was back here.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.452
Yeah, it's right there.

28:41.292 --> 28:42.625
What are you doing?

28:42.660 --> 28:44.494
What are you doing?!

28:44.528 --> 28:46.596
I'm getting into
her studio tonight.

28:56.240 --> 28:58.308
Toby. Hey,
what are you doing here?

28:58.342 --> 29:00.576
Your parents were on
their way out. They let me in.

29:05.582 --> 29:07.483
What's wrong?

29:07.518 --> 29:11.254
I thought that by getting
my own place above the brew

29:11.288 --> 29:13.556
that I could escape
my screwed-up family.

29:13.590 --> 29:17.560
Right. And it does not help when they
throw birthday parties right below you.

29:19.496 --> 29:22.265
Do your parents expect you
to make an appearance

29:22.299 --> 29:24.600
at this
coming-out-of-the-dark party?

29:24.635 --> 29:26.502
They can expect all they want.

29:26.537 --> 29:29.205
I'll wait for the
she's-leaving-rosewood party.

29:29.239 --> 29:31.607
I'm gonna throw you that party.

29:31.642 --> 29:34.243
Are you okay with me
barging in like this?

29:34.278 --> 29:37.347
I mean, did you have plans?

29:37.381 --> 29:40.183
I, um, I did, actually.

29:40.217 --> 29:42.652
I just have this really big
French test coming up.

29:42.686 --> 29:45.555
I have to read
that massive book.

29:45.589 --> 29:49.225
Which means that
you should totally stay.

29:49.259 --> 29:52.428
Good. That's what
I was hoping you'd say.

29:55.265 --> 29:57.600
Toby...

29:57.634 --> 30:01.337
How is it possible that you
and I are the only two people

30:01.372 --> 30:03.406
that know that Jenna
was faking for so long?

30:03.440 --> 30:06.542
I think most people want to
buy into a happy ending.

30:06.577 --> 30:09.545
Yeah, but your parents...
how did she fool them?

30:09.580 --> 30:12.315
I mean, they were living
in the same house.

30:12.349 --> 30:14.550
Did they just not notice
that she was able to see?

30:14.585 --> 30:16.452
Did she sleep with
her sunglasses on?

30:16.487 --> 30:18.421
She told my parents
a few weeks ago

30:18.455 --> 30:22.525
that she started seeing shadows over
the summer, and then blurry figures.

30:22.559 --> 30:25.595
And they just bought that she didn't mention
this in her letters home from camp?

30:25.629 --> 30:27.597
She said
she was scared...

30:27.631 --> 30:30.466
scared that it might
suddenly go back to darkness

30:30.501 --> 30:33.569
and she'd have to live with
everyone pitying her even more.

30:33.604 --> 30:35.505
Wow.

30:35.539 --> 30:38.374
It's so weird.

30:38.409 --> 30:39.675
What?

30:39.710 --> 30:42.612
That the most honest person
I know has to share parents

30:42.646 --> 30:45.415
with the most deceitful
person in this town.

30:46.617 --> 30:49.385
Hey...

30:49.420 --> 30:51.587
Can we not discuss that person?

31:06.470 --> 31:08.337
Hey, where have you been?

31:08.372 --> 31:10.440
Bathroom.
Everything okay?

31:10.474 --> 31:11.507
You kind of
ditched me back there.

31:11.542 --> 31:14.243
With Jenna.
So can we go?

31:14.278 --> 31:16.245
No. I don't want to be rude.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.648
Jenna can see now, she'll
know we left before the cake.

31:18.682 --> 31:21.584
We are not staying for cake.
We have a dinner reservation.

31:21.618 --> 31:26.255
Just a couple more minutes.
Emily had to tell me something.

31:38.635 --> 31:40.736
Can you wait one second?

31:43.307 --> 31:44.707
What are you doing?!

31:44.741 --> 31:47.376
Looking for a coconut.

31:47.411 --> 31:50.513
These vanilla ones are gross.
Would you please stop?

31:50.547 --> 31:52.315
I'm gonna stop
till I find a coconut.

31:52.349 --> 31:54.350
Paige. Can I get you some coffee?
Is she drunk?

31:54.384 --> 31:56.586
No, I'm not drunk, I'm hungry.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.688
And your cupcakes
taste like old pennies.

31:58.722 --> 32:01.357
Paige, you and I... oh. Really?

32:01.391 --> 32:02.558
Finally, you have time for me?

32:02.593 --> 32:05.228
All right, let's dance.
Let's dance.

32:05.262 --> 32:07.296
I can't dance right now.
I'm working.

32:07.331 --> 32:09.465
Fine. I'll dance
by myself.

32:14.438 --> 32:16.205
Are you okay?

32:16.240 --> 32:18.407
Are you okay? Oh, my gosh.

32:18.442 --> 32:20.476
Can somebody get some ice, please?
Everybody back up.

32:20.511 --> 32:23.312
Are you okay?
Don't move. Be careful.

32:23.347 --> 32:24.480
Is she one of your friends?
Yes.

32:24.515 --> 32:26.249
We should get her out of here.

32:26.283 --> 32:27.416
Okay, come on.

32:41.826 --> 32:43.827
Hanna.

32:43.861 --> 32:45.696
Hey. Where's Paige?

32:45.730 --> 32:48.932
Getting stitches.
Um, this is Nate,

32:48.966 --> 32:52.936
Maya's cousin. Hi. Hey.

32:52.970 --> 32:55.605
Nate, would you mind
getting us some coffee?

32:55.640 --> 32:56.907
They said it was
gonna be a while.

32:56.941 --> 32:58.775
Yeah.
Thanks.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.646
I thought Spencer was here.
She was.

33:02.680 --> 33:05.682
She bumped into wilden
and he scared her off.

33:09.487 --> 33:10.687
This was at the church?

33:10.722 --> 33:12.489
Is it yours?

33:12.523 --> 33:15.959
Mine had a rip in the pocket
that I sewed with a pink...

33:17.595 --> 33:19.463
thread.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.465
This is mine.

33:21.499 --> 33:22.899
Well, it hasn't been
anywhere near a fire.

33:22.934 --> 33:24.801
How did this get
to the rummage sale?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.837
That can't be a coincidence.

33:26.871 --> 33:29.706
Spencer was right... this "A"
definitely has an agenda.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.475
When did you take it off
that night?

33:31.509 --> 33:32.843
Because you didn't have it on
at the graveyard, Emily.

33:32.877 --> 33:34.711
When we found you
you were shivering.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.880
I know I wore it to Spencer's house.
That's all I remember.

33:36.914 --> 33:38.615
Did you have it in Jenna's car?

33:38.649 --> 33:40.684
Did you leave it there?

33:40.718 --> 33:44.755
Because if she's our pal now, why
didn't she just give it back to you?

33:44.789 --> 33:46.890
I don't know. Maybe...

33:46.924 --> 33:49.659
Maybe Jenna wasn't the only
person I saw that night.

33:55.833 --> 33:57.667
It's my mom.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.569
I've got to
get back to the church

33:59.604 --> 34:02.739
or I'll be sorting old panty
hose for the rest of my life.

34:07.478 --> 34:09.513
Hey.
Where's your friend?

34:09.547 --> 34:11.447
Uh, she had to go meet her mom.

34:11.482 --> 34:12.916
Forgot to ask how you take it.

34:12.949 --> 34:14.618
Put cream in both of 'em.

34:14.652 --> 34:15.819
Thanks.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.688
Oh. Can I help you?

34:52.723 --> 34:55.492
Oh. Yeah, I-I was just
looking for Emily.

34:55.525 --> 34:57.594
She took her friend
to the hospital,

34:57.628 --> 34:59.830
and left me holding
all of the cupcakes.

34:59.864 --> 35:02.599
I'm sure she's gonna be back.
I'm not.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.671
Excuse me.

35:07.705 --> 35:09.639
Aria. What is going on?

35:09.674 --> 35:13.510
Uh... Someone said that they just
put out some stuffed mushrooms.

35:13.544 --> 35:15.579
I don't want a mushroom.
I want a dinner.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.647
I know.
And we will leave soon.

35:17.682 --> 35:19.850
Are we hanging out here because
you don't want to have this meal?

35:19.884 --> 35:22.886
I can afford to
take you <i>dinner,</i> Aria.

35:22.920 --> 35:26.723
It's not necessary. You just
bought me an expensive camera.

35:26.757 --> 35:28.592
What does that
have to do with it?

35:28.626 --> 35:30.760
You're spending money that you don't have.
I do have it.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.864
I chose the restaurant in new hope
because I wanted to celebrate.

35:33.898 --> 35:36.867
Celebrate what?
The job I got today.

35:36.901 --> 35:39.669
You got that editing job?
Why didn't you <i>tell</i> me?

35:39.704 --> 35:40.937
I thought it'd be nicer
at a private table

35:40.972 --> 35:44.007
where we're not surrounded
by people with silly hats.

35:47.578 --> 35:48.712
Oh, crap!

35:48.746 --> 35:50.747
Everything okay?
It's all wet!

35:50.781 --> 35:53.517
I don't have one
dry memory card!

35:53.551 --> 35:55.819
Who's been using my equipment
as a coaster?!

35:55.853 --> 35:58.722
I could run to your studio
and grab you a couple more.

35:58.756 --> 36:00.557
I can't ask you to do that.

36:00.591 --> 36:03.593
You're not asking, I'm offering.
Where are your keys?

36:06.731 --> 36:09.766
You're a doll.
And you're officially hired.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.635
Tell her to take the job.

36:13.905 --> 36:15.872
Okay. Her studio's down the
street, and we'll be right back.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.808
I'll call the restaurant and cancel
the reservation. No, don't. Please.

36:18.843 --> 36:23.480
Just call them up, ask them to
hold it for a little bit longer.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.549
I will be right back.

37:30.615 --> 37:31.748
Lucas.

37:31.782 --> 37:34.517
I need to get inside.

37:34.552 --> 37:36.620
Uh, studio's closed.

37:36.654 --> 37:38.922
Leave the door open
and walk away.

37:38.956 --> 37:41.691
I can't do that.

37:41.726 --> 37:43.960
Then drop the keys
and let me find them.

37:47.932 --> 37:50.767
Lucas, get out of my way.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.575
Aria.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.877
Lucas.
What's going on?

38:03.481 --> 38:04.914
Is everything okay here?

38:07.618 --> 38:09.519
Did you get what you needed?

38:15.593 --> 38:17.661
Mind if I ask you a question?

38:18.896 --> 38:22.599
Is Paige just a friend,
or something more?

38:24.535 --> 38:25.802
We dated for a while.

38:25.836 --> 38:29.606
Was that before Maya, or after?

38:31.575 --> 38:33.843
It was kind of in between.

38:38.849 --> 38:40.650
I'll be right back.

38:40.685 --> 38:43.553
You get my text?

38:43.587 --> 38:46.489
Why do you think I'm here?
Let's go upstairs. I can't.

38:46.524 --> 38:47.957
Nate's here and Paige is
coming out any moment.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.660
But if wilden left that
probably means Garrett left too

38:50.695 --> 38:53.797
and we have to see what's on the
card he stuck in those flowers.

38:56.600 --> 38:57.767
Hey! Garrett!

38:57.802 --> 38:59.502
No! Nate, stop!

38:59.537 --> 39:01.705
Hey! Get off me!

39:01.739 --> 39:03.440
Let me go!

39:03.474 --> 39:04.941
Get off!

39:15.815 --> 39:18.450
Hey.

39:18.485 --> 39:19.818
You didn't have to stay.

39:19.853 --> 39:22.621
I wanted to. You were
in there for a long time.

39:22.656 --> 39:26.659
They gave me a few stitches,
and they wanted to run a test.

39:26.693 --> 39:30.663
Why? I told the doctor how
little I had to drink,

39:30.697 --> 39:32.765
and he wanted to do
a tox screen.

39:32.799 --> 39:35.567
Turns out I wasn't
messed up from the alcohol.

39:35.602 --> 39:36.902
What do you mean?

39:36.936 --> 39:40.606
There were traces
of milizopam in my system.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.508
It's a sleeping pill.

39:42.542 --> 39:45.611
The doctor asked if I set
my cup down at any point

39:45.645 --> 39:47.813
or drank from someone else's.

39:47.847 --> 39:49.815
Honestly, who knows?

39:49.849 --> 39:53.686
It's such a blur.
I don't remember anything.

39:53.720 --> 39:56.588
I need
to call my parents.

39:56.623 --> 39:58.957
My dad's gonna want to
talk to the doctor.

40:01.528 --> 40:03.495
Here.

40:03.530 --> 40:05.664
I don't want that on me
when they get here.

41:28.681 --> 41:31.583
<i>Are you home yet?</i>

41:31.618 --> 41:33.519
I'm still at ezra's.
He's in the shower.

41:33.553 --> 41:34.753
Call me when you get home.

41:34.788 --> 41:36.922
That might be a while.

41:36.956 --> 41:38.857
<i>Why?</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

41:38.892 --> 41:41.860
Well, I basically ditched him
at Jenna's party,

41:41.895 --> 41:44.563
so I'm trying
to smooth the waters.

41:44.597 --> 41:45.998
Have you looked
at the negatives yet?

41:46.032 --> 41:49.668
I'm doing it now.
It's my first chance.

41:49.702 --> 41:52.538
<i>What are you typing?</i>
<i>I'm looking up milizopam.</i>

41:52.572 --> 41:55.007
Is Paige gonna be okay?
<i>She'll be fine</i>

41:55.041 --> 41:57.910
until she realizes the drugs
came from my flask.

41:57.944 --> 41:58.977
<i>It looks like</i>

41:59.012 --> 42:01.547
these first two rolls
are just yearbook stuff.

42:01.581 --> 42:05.918
"Milizopam. A strong sedative
prescribed for sleep disorders.

42:05.952 --> 42:10.722
Also used to subdue aggressive
patients and inmates."

42:10.757 --> 42:12.691
Go on.

42:12.725 --> 42:15.527
<i>There's a list of side effects</i>
<i>when mixed with alcohol.</i>

42:15.562 --> 42:19.465
Memory loss.

42:19.499 --> 42:22.835
You were totally screwed with.

42:22.869 --> 42:25.771
Was that flask ever
out of your sight that night?

42:25.805 --> 42:27.739
It was probably in there
before I got to Spencer's.

42:27.774 --> 42:31.677
Yeah, but why just you?
Why weren't we all drugged?

42:31.711 --> 42:33.779
<i>Maybe that was the plan, Aria.</i>

42:33.813 --> 42:35.781
Lucky I wasn't in the mood
to share that night.

42:38.518 --> 42:39.751
Em...

42:39.786 --> 42:42.754
Does it say anything about
what those pills look like?

42:43.957 --> 42:46.592
"Light blue and oval-shaped."

42:46.626 --> 42:47.960
With the letters m-z-m
on them?

42:47.994 --> 42:50.762
Yeah. How'd you know?

42:52.899 --> 42:55.801
I'm holding three of them...

42:55.835 --> 42:58.871
And they were in
Lucas's camera bag.

43:28.889 --> 43:33.263
