WEBVTT

00:00.003 --> 00:02.003
_

00:02.004 --> 00:04.070
Right, that there.

00:04.072 --> 00:06.094
There y'are.
HE SIGHS

00:06.096 --> 00:09.038
It's tatty, it looks terrible.

00:09.039 --> 00:13.038
So would you if you'd been up and
down all those chimneys.

00:13.039 --> 00:17.010
Actually, it were tatty
when Arkwright bought him, but...

00:17.012 --> 00:18.033
I know.

00:18.036 --> 00:21.010
I know, the price was right. Mm-hmm.

00:21.012 --> 00:22.089
It's lost an eye.

00:22.091 --> 00:24.047
Only temporarily.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.026
Now it's cross-eyed.

00:34.027 --> 00:37.027
ERIC: Hey, mind me foot.

00:38.043 --> 00:39.091
Hey up.

00:43.095 --> 00:45.048
Where you going with that?

00:46.048 --> 00:49.061
Somewhere quiet,
free from nosy neighbours.

00:49.064 --> 00:52.073
Say hello to our new fitness regime.

00:52.076 --> 00:56.018
Where we can develop muscles
that will be irresistible to the

00:56.020 --> 00:58.002
female of the species.

00:58.003 --> 00:59.066
Even wives.

00:59.067 --> 01:01.042
Especially wives.

01:01.043 --> 01:04.013
We're in search
of domestic happiness.

01:04.016 --> 01:05.081
He means fun.

01:05.084 --> 01:08.066
That too. We're
going to surprise 'em.

01:08.067 --> 01:10.025
Today trampoline, tomorrow...

01:10.028 --> 01:11.073
HE INHALES

01:11.075 --> 01:13.073
...Mr Wonderful.

01:13.075 --> 01:16.073
Let's see how they feel about
living with Mr Six-Pack.

01:16.075 --> 01:19.069
And for this you get
out of a warm bed, do you?

01:19.072 --> 01:22.057
Warm? She wears bed socks.

01:22.060 --> 01:24.090
How tropical is that?

01:24.091 --> 01:26.084
C'mon. Oh...

01:46.096 --> 01:50.039
HE YAWNS

01:54.084 --> 01:56.003
Oh.

02:01.084 --> 02:05.040
HE HUMS A TUNE

02:17.003 --> 02:19.062
All right, all right, if you insist.

02:19.063 --> 02:21.078
Right.

02:21.079 --> 02:23.032
That one don't go in there.

02:29.072 --> 02:31.066
HE YAWNS

02:31.068 --> 02:33.997
You've got a hole in your face.
Where?

02:34.000 --> 02:37.021
Underneath your nose,
it looks like the Channel tunnel.

02:37.024 --> 02:40.081
Yeah. Well, look what time it is,
I'm entitled to yawn.

02:40.084 --> 02:42.042
Listen, I want you awake and alert,

02:42.043 --> 02:44.090
you're going to be looking after
the shop for an hour.

02:44.091 --> 02:47.081
I can manage.
Not as well as if I had a rise.

02:47.084 --> 02:51.002
But relax, I'm awake.

02:51.003 --> 02:53.090
You call that awake, do you?

02:53.091 --> 02:55.062
Come here. What?

02:55.063 --> 02:57.033
Let me have a look, let me see.

02:57.036 --> 02:59.043
Stay there, let's have a look.

03:01.003 --> 03:04.092
I can see through here what you
were doing last night.

03:06.096 --> 03:09.002
Good grief, no wonder you're tired.

03:09.003 --> 03:10.062
Oh, dear.

03:10.063 --> 03:12.066
Hey, I were
home early last night.

03:12.068 --> 03:16.038
Anyway, if you daren't leave me in
charge, why don't I go for the tree?

03:16.039 --> 03:20.066
No, because you'll come back
with some clapped out twig.

03:20.068 --> 03:22.068
I want a tree...

03:34.096 --> 03:37.062
I want a tree that he
would've chosen.

03:37.063 --> 03:42.018
I want a tree that says,
"Arkwright chose this."

03:42.020 --> 03:47.031
Or more accurately it would be,
"Arkwright ch-ch-ch-ch-chose it."

03:51.091 --> 03:55.027
Mm, oh heck. Who left those there?

04:00.024 --> 04:01.063
Ho!

04:03.063 --> 04:06.087
Anybody seen a reindeer
called Golicky Gill?

04:08.036 --> 04:09.086
You get dafter.

04:09.087 --> 04:11.997
HE LAUGHS

04:12.000 --> 04:14.021
Our Madge doesn't do Christmas.

04:14.024 --> 04:17.017
She thinks mistletoe
is a foot disease.

04:17.019 --> 04:19.000
Ho, ho, ho.

04:20.076 --> 04:25.024
Guess who's coming down Madge's
chimney with a secret admirer?

04:26.091 --> 04:31.045
If it's that dozy Gastric,
he can run up his own chimney.

04:31.048 --> 04:34.997
Well you'd better not hang about,
Madonna's been after him,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.066
you know, sending
him autographed pictures.

04:38.067 --> 04:41.045
Does he know she's probably
no good at gravy?

04:41.048 --> 04:42.067
Oh.

04:43.091 --> 04:47.045
Come away, you'll be
as daft as the men round here.

04:47.048 --> 04:50.088
Oh, I like daft,
makes me feel at home.

04:52.019 --> 04:54.005
Welcome home, Mavis.

04:54.007 --> 04:55.093
Mm-mm.

04:55.096 --> 04:57.053
Thank you, Granville.

04:57.055 --> 04:59.079
MADGE MUTTERS

05:01.064 --> 05:03.096
SHE HISSES

05:08.016 --> 05:10.069
Don't forget that
loaf for Mrs Mottishaw.

05:10.072 --> 05:12.045
Mm-hmm, engraved on my mind.

05:12.048 --> 05:15.029
And don't let more than
two kids in at once.

05:15.031 --> 05:16.062
How do you arrange that?

05:16.064 --> 05:19.043
Well you belt the first two
and the third one stays outside.

05:21.043 --> 05:25.089
Oh and keep your eye on
that Mr Faucet, he brings mice in.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.077
How do you mean,
"He brings mice in"?

05:27.079 --> 05:30.048
I don't know how he does it
but he brings mice in.

05:31.096 --> 05:33.081
BELL RINGS

05:33.084 --> 05:35.014
Good morning, Eric.

05:35.016 --> 05:36.028
Is it?

05:37.096 --> 05:39.040
I must've missed it.

05:40.096 --> 05:43.002
Well, good morning anyway, Eric.

05:43.004 --> 05:46.997
Well, not for me,
she's in a foul mood.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.081
She found three grey hairs.

05:51.040 --> 05:54.060
That's the closest to
excitement we've got all year.

05:57.064 --> 06:01.045
Although, wait
until she sees the new...

06:01.048 --> 06:02.089
HE INHALES

06:02.091 --> 06:04.019
...Mr Wonderful.

06:11.060 --> 06:12.086
It's a work in progress.

06:12.088 --> 06:14.093
Yeah, yeah.

06:14.096 --> 06:16.029
Anyway, where we going?

06:16.031 --> 06:18.053
We're going to get a tree.

06:18.055 --> 06:21.065
How big a tree?
It's only a small van.

06:21.067 --> 06:24.004
It's only a small tree. Now c'mon.

06:28.052 --> 06:31.077
Hey, if that Mrs Alison comes in,
start coughing,

06:31.079 --> 06:34.066
that should start her off.
Once she gets started,

06:34.067 --> 06:36.069
she'll be a pushover for that cough

06:36.072 --> 06:39.007
syrup we're trying to get rid of.
HE LAUGHS

06:45.028 --> 06:46.062
Now what?

06:46.064 --> 06:49.005
There's some of yesterday's
scones out there,

06:49.007 --> 06:53.005
now if you wrap them tightly
in a wet tea towel and spin them

06:53.007 --> 06:56.016
round your head a few times,
they come out as good as new.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.036
Right, tightly mind, tightly.

07:04.064 --> 07:07.072
You don't want them, you know,
bouncing about, do you?

07:23.076 --> 07:25.009
Hey, what you doing?

07:25.012 --> 07:28.065
I'm confiscating your phone,
give your Leroy a break.

07:28.067 --> 07:30.029
A break?

07:30.031 --> 07:33.090
Have you seen all that young totty
that hangs round his neck?

07:33.091 --> 07:35.040
I have noticed that.

07:37.031 --> 07:38.090
Here. Mm?

07:38.091 --> 07:40.053
Why don't you nag him a bit?

07:40.055 --> 07:42.096
In fact, make it a lot.

07:51.072 --> 07:53.077
I do love a girl in uniform.

07:53.079 --> 07:55.048
So did your uncle.

07:59.091 --> 08:02.076
ENGINE REVS
GEARS CREAK

08:13.055 --> 08:15.019
TILL RINGS

08:21.096 --> 08:24.026
He only comes home at weekends.

08:24.028 --> 08:27.997
It's a good job he doesn't pop back
home on Wednesday nights.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.014
Oh, really?
What happens on Wednesday nights?

08:31.016 --> 08:33.086
Well, if I were inclined to gossip,

08:33.087 --> 08:36.057
I could tell you stuff
that would make your ears curl.

08:36.058 --> 08:40.073
Mrs Hussein, we all know that
you're not one to gossip.

08:40.076 --> 08:43.042
Thank you. But...

08:43.043 --> 08:45.086
At this very moment in time,
you're really well

08:45.087 --> 08:49.008
placed for an ear that is
ready to be curled.

08:50.043 --> 08:51.086
It's a nice ear.

08:51.087 --> 08:53.057
Oh, came with the face.

08:53.059 --> 08:55.072
SHE LAUGHS

08:57.024 --> 09:00.057
Well, I suppose I could tell ya,
in confidence naturally.

09:00.059 --> 09:02.018
Oh, naturally.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.043
Well...

09:06.043 --> 09:09.053
Every Wednesday afternoon
you can see the preparations.

09:09.056 --> 09:11.029
Go on, go on. I'm hooked.

09:11.032 --> 09:14.086
You can hear her singing,
hair in curlers,

09:14.087 --> 09:17.057
who sings with their
hair in curlers?

09:17.059 --> 09:19.042
Oh, no, I'll have
to pass on that one.

09:19.043 --> 09:20.087
It gets worse...

09:22.015 --> 09:23.081
Every Wednesday afternoon?

09:23.083 --> 09:26.086
According to Mrs Hussein and
she lives opposite.

09:26.087 --> 09:29.029
Hair in curlers,
Wednesday afternoon.

09:29.032 --> 09:31.053
You can't argue
with evidence like that.

09:31.056 --> 09:33.057
It's him you feel sorry for.

09:33.059 --> 09:37.001
Oh, be honest, girl,
it's us we feel sorry for.

09:37.004 --> 09:39.364
How long since you were in curlers
on a Wednesday afternoon?

09:41.043 --> 09:44.070
I daren't think.
Where does the time go?

09:44.072 --> 09:46.066
Still, it hasn't
taken you much time

09:46.067 --> 09:49.001
to stamp your authority on this
new little job of yours.

09:49.004 --> 09:51.015
You can't have them
doing as they like.

09:52.096 --> 09:56.024
CAR HORNS BEEP

10:03.072 --> 10:05.073
All right. Thank you, Steve.

10:05.076 --> 10:07.032
And the other one.

10:11.052 --> 10:13.081
It's too big. It's magnificent.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.038
But too big.

10:15.039 --> 10:18.052
No, it's your imagination
that's too small, Eric.

10:20.056 --> 10:22.015
Put it in the back of the van.

10:24.039 --> 10:27.009
Out? What's he doing out?

10:27.011 --> 10:29.073
He's gone to fetch a tree,
Mrs Featherstone,

10:29.076 --> 10:31.094
but I'm sure I'll be able
to assist you.

10:31.096 --> 10:35.042
I must confess, Leroy, to not
being entirely happy with

10:35.043 --> 10:40.008
the idea of your generation handling
a mature person's daily calories.

10:42.048 --> 10:45.001
I find that young people tend
to maintain the highest

10:45.004 --> 10:47.038
standards of personal hygiene,
Mrs Featherstone.

10:47.039 --> 10:49.052
Yes, but they share it about so.

10:50.091 --> 10:54.038
You see, I've seen you covered
in wall-to-wall trollop

10:54.039 --> 10:55.087
on numerous occasions.

10:58.028 --> 11:02.049
A close observer would've
seen me struggling to resist.

11:02.052 --> 11:04.046
I was a Girl Guide, Leroy,

11:04.048 --> 11:08.011
we had to light our fires by
rubbing two sticks together.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.072
Got some nice ham on the bone.

11:17.096 --> 11:20.039
That is not the image
I want to leave with.

11:21.091 --> 11:25.001
Now, are your mince pies wrapped?

11:25.004 --> 11:28.086
Very snugly, Mrs Featherstone,
in their own boxes.

11:28.087 --> 11:32.024
Don't, I had three
husbands went that way.

11:37.028 --> 11:39.043
TYRES SCREECH

11:48.008 --> 11:50.022
At last, what kept ya?

11:50.024 --> 11:51.057
Where's Eric?

11:51.059 --> 11:56.046
Well, he's in here somewhere,
otherwise the tree has been driving.

11:56.048 --> 12:00.018
I had to take over,
it were going too fast.

12:00.019 --> 12:02.086
Can somebody open this door?

12:02.087 --> 12:05.011
Well, go on. Go and open his door.

12:12.056 --> 12:13.076
Get me out.

12:17.052 --> 12:18.090
Are you pushing it?

12:18.091 --> 12:21.022
Yes! Yeah.
We're pushing at our end. Ow!

12:21.024 --> 12:22.077
Well, right, right.

12:22.080 --> 12:25.033
On the count of three, yeah?

12:25.036 --> 12:26.998
One, two...

12:27.000 --> 12:29.036
HE GRUNTS

12:34.004 --> 12:35.028
Three.

12:39.019 --> 12:41.081
LAUGHING: Merry Christmas, Eric.

12:41.084 --> 12:45.033
You think you ought to help but
you don't really feel qualified.

12:45.036 --> 12:49.008
It's the only time they put some
real feeling into their dancing.

12:52.036 --> 12:55.033
They deserve the occasional pain,
especially there,

12:55.036 --> 12:59.001
it's the only time they regard it
with any sense of responsibility.

12:59.004 --> 13:01.025
LAUGHING: Well, it's no
use approaching them

13:01.028 --> 13:03.087
till they've finished
their fancy footwork.

13:06.087 --> 13:09.090
I've always maintained
they're not good with pain.

13:09.091 --> 13:12.029
Well, not there anyway.

13:12.032 --> 13:16.018
Still, it's the last place you
expect to find a Christmas tree.

13:16.019 --> 13:18.090
THEY LAUGH

13:18.091 --> 13:20.090
THEY TALK OVER EACH OTHER

13:20.091 --> 13:24.049
No, you go there and give it a...
Now... What?

13:24.052 --> 13:26.073
Did you have to get one this size?

13:26.076 --> 13:28.070
It was a snip.

13:28.072 --> 13:31.057
I think I've just been
given the snip.

13:31.059 --> 13:33.038
Oh, hello, Mrs Wilson.

13:33.039 --> 13:35.038
No, no, we're not closed, love, no.

13:35.039 --> 13:38.063
Come in. Just keep going.
Don't you worry about your hat.

13:44.052 --> 13:46.014
And how are you today, Mrs Wilson?

13:46.015 --> 13:48.008
It's always a pleasure to see you.

13:51.076 --> 13:55.022
Leroy, your end is too low.
Now, come on. Lift it up, will you?

13:55.024 --> 13:56.033
I'm trying!

13:56.036 --> 13:58.053
Are you lifting? Push!
Yeah, of course I'm lifting.

13:58.056 --> 14:00.086
Oh... Let it go, let it go.

14:00.087 --> 14:02.042
Oh!

14:02.043 --> 14:03.080
Oh.

14:04.096 --> 14:07.066
It's no good, we're going to
have to cut something off.

14:07.067 --> 14:09.070
Story of my life.

14:09.072 --> 14:12.029
You won't be saying that
when you come to me

14:12.032 --> 14:16.014
for my help with your
problems with your wife.

14:16.015 --> 14:19.024
Leroy, go and get
the keys to the yard gate.

14:24.076 --> 14:26.077
What can a grocer do about my wife?

14:26.080 --> 14:28.053
Oh...

14:28.056 --> 14:33.998
Eric, your small shopkeeper is,
well, he's plugged into generations

14:34.000 --> 14:39.019
of folk wisdom, including the
secret ways into a woman's heart.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.057
Your medieval monarch wouldn't go
anywhere without his grocer

14:44.059 --> 14:46.022
to read the omens.

14:46.024 --> 14:48.086
I don't want to hear anything
about animal intestines.

14:48.087 --> 14:50.053
No, no, no, no.

14:50.056 --> 14:53.029
These were progressive grocers,

14:53.032 --> 14:55.028
they used to read the, um...

14:56.076 --> 14:58.081
...runes.

14:58.084 --> 15:03.018
You see, the fact of the matter
was that it was mistranslated

15:03.019 --> 15:08.038
from the Anglo-Saxon, it
should've been translated as...

15:08.039 --> 15:09.083
prunes.

15:11.087 --> 15:16.072
Your medieval grocer used
to read the prunes.

15:22.056 --> 15:24.048
You see, it's all in the wrinkles.

15:29.072 --> 15:34.011
The secret of life is
hidden in the wrinkles.

15:38.019 --> 15:40.094
Take half a pound for the wife,

15:40.096 --> 15:44.019
but keep her locked up
until the effects wear off.

15:47.084 --> 15:51.011
That tree took
some shifting, didn't it?

15:52.036 --> 15:54.094
I told you it was too big.
Oh, it's enough of that.

15:54.096 --> 15:56.076
I told you, the price was right.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.049
CHUCKLING: Oh, dear.

16:01.052 --> 16:03.070
I'd forgotten we'd got these,

16:03.072 --> 16:07.033
Dr Proctor's Pick Me Up
for Upset Stomachs.

16:07.035 --> 16:09.998
We should forget them again,
they never sold,

16:10.000 --> 16:14.009
they taste too foul, they taste
like a weight lifter's underwear.

16:14.011 --> 16:19.053
Oh, no, this is the Christmas season,
Leroy, people overindulge,

16:19.056 --> 16:22.039
they'll be in need
of a good pick me up.

16:25.032 --> 16:26.049
Oh.

16:26.052 --> 16:31.094
Ah, Mavis, now this here is
a talking Father Christmas,

16:31.096 --> 16:36.038
if you'd like to press just there
he'll have a message for you.

16:36.039 --> 16:39.025
HE MAKES A GURGLING NOISE

16:39.028 --> 16:43.005
When in doubt, say yes.

16:43.008 --> 16:45.053
I can do that, what's the question?

16:45.056 --> 16:47.090
Now that depends upon your Madge.

16:47.091 --> 16:51.062
Oh, she thinks I'm unreliable,
lose something once

16:51.063 --> 16:55.053
and they never forget.
It was Marks and Spencer's.

16:55.056 --> 16:58.094
It's not as if I forgot and
left Auntie Mary in Pound Saver.

16:58.096 --> 17:00.090
Oh.
HE LAUGHS

17:00.091 --> 17:02.073
Yes, well, there are a few people

17:02.076 --> 17:05.066
that you would like to
forget, you know. (Go on.)

17:05.067 --> 17:08.066
I went back for her, same day.

17:08.067 --> 17:12.082
I often dream about
your Madge, you know,

17:12.084 --> 17:17.036
emigrating to somewhere where
the men are short-sighted.

17:18.076 --> 17:20.028
Anyway, what can I get you?

17:21.079 --> 17:27.040
There, you see, you've done it now.
You made me lose concentration.

17:27.044 --> 17:29.076
Oh, ha, take your time.

17:31.019 --> 17:35.041
Has your Madge ever thought
about taking up dangerous sports?

17:35.044 --> 17:39.018
Oh, she's never said.
All I know is she's set her

17:39.019 --> 17:43.013
face against Christmas, she won't be
coming to see your tree tonight.

17:43.016 --> 17:46.013
Oh, well, that means you'll be
coming on your own, eh?

17:46.016 --> 17:48.018
Oh, I can't come.

17:48.019 --> 17:51.029
Well, I wouldn't enjoy it if she's
stuck up there in her bedroom.

17:51.031 --> 17:53.069
HE SIGHS
It'd make me feel rotten.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.077
Save us a teacake, will ya?
DOG BARKS

17:55.079 --> 17:57.094
Yes, I'll leave it just
there by the door,

17:57.096 --> 17:59.092
you can snatch it on your way back.
Whoa!

18:03.064 --> 18:07.054
Why can't he get a smaller dog,
or let it pull him in a cart?

18:07.056 --> 18:12.069
I think it's a Tarzan thing, you
know, man against the savage beast.

18:12.071 --> 18:15.034
Mm, which brings me
back to your Madge.

18:15.036 --> 18:18.049
Oh, I wish she'd relax
and have a good laugh.

18:18.051 --> 18:22.029
Oh, needs a laugh, eh?

18:22.031 --> 18:23.084
I know just the man.

18:28.087 --> 18:31.077
What are we doing for Christmas?

18:31.079 --> 18:32.096
Forget it.

18:34.016 --> 18:35.049
Oh, as much fun as that?

18:35.051 --> 18:37.998
We've got your mum and mine
on Christmas Day

18:38.000 --> 18:40.013
and we've got me
brother Boxing Day.

18:40.016 --> 18:42.029
Your brother? What? Again?

18:42.031 --> 18:44.046
He's all alone, Eric.

18:44.048 --> 18:47.013
What happened to misery
loving company?

18:47.016 --> 18:49.079
Oh, lighten up,
look at the face on ya.

18:52.096 --> 18:55.029
MUMBLING: What did you
get for Christmas, Eric?

18:55.031 --> 18:56.113
Her mother and her brother.

19:05.064 --> 19:07.998
Dr Proctor's Pick Me Up?

19:08.000 --> 19:11.034
I should need picking up
if I drank this.

19:11.036 --> 19:15.031
Oh, well, please yourself.
It's better than trampolining anyway.

19:17.003 --> 19:20.054
Frank Sinatra used to drink
this by the bucket-load.

19:20.056 --> 19:23.066
He said it helped him
through the high notes,

19:23.067 --> 19:27.009
that and... all them women, mm.

19:27.011 --> 19:28.094
This is one of your stories.

19:28.096 --> 19:30.021
Mm? I don't believe it.

19:30.023 --> 19:32.018
Well, if you had that many women,

19:32.019 --> 19:34.074
you would need some help,
wouldn't you, eh?

19:34.076 --> 19:37.086
I've only got one
and I still need help.

19:37.087 --> 19:39.096
Yeah, there you go then.

19:42.003 --> 19:45.039
It says here, "For upset stomachs."

19:47.079 --> 19:50.057
It doesn't say anything about...

19:50.059 --> 19:52.082
HE WHISTLES

19:52.084 --> 19:55.029
You know.

19:55.031 --> 19:58.006
Well, of course it doesn't say
anything about...

19:58.008 --> 19:59.076
HE TRIES TO WHISTLE

20:02.000 --> 20:06.009
They put that on the label,
they'd get arrested, wouldn't they?

20:06.011 --> 20:09.006
Is there a money back
guarantee if it fails to...?

20:09.008 --> 20:10.998
HE WHISTLES

20:11.000 --> 20:15.066
Fails? This can't fail.
This is wisdom of the ages, this.

20:15.067 --> 20:19.074
This goes back long before
Dr Proctor. That...

20:19.076 --> 20:22.016
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

20:23.048 --> 20:27.029
Dr Proctor stole this recipe.

20:27.031 --> 20:28.077
Were he a crook?

20:28.079 --> 20:30.036
He was an opportunist.

20:31.051 --> 20:35.086
You see, he stumbled on this
formula when he was excavating

20:35.087 --> 20:39.096
a tomb in the Valley of the Kings
just outside Pontefract.

20:46.072 --> 20:50.061
Valley of the Kings is not
just outside Pontefract.

20:50.064 --> 20:52.006
No, you're right,

20:52.008 --> 20:54.000
it's nearer Wakefield, isn't it?

21:08.071 --> 21:10.041
All right.

21:10.044 --> 21:15.066
Now this very evening, Madge,
who is deeply attracted to you...

21:15.067 --> 21:20.087
Give over. When she sees me,
she goes, "Eurgh!"

21:22.064 --> 21:25.069
...who is deeply attracted to you,

21:25.071 --> 21:30.001
is up there in her bedroom at
this moment, miserable.

21:30.003 --> 21:33.057
What she needs is, she needs
someone to give her a giggle,

21:33.059 --> 21:36.051
make her laugh, you know,
pull funny faces.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I dunno if I can do funny faces.

21:42.011 --> 21:44.044
Oh, come on, you've got a good start.

21:46.036 --> 21:50.096
No, you see, if you make her laugh
you're halfway to romance.

21:54.039 --> 21:56.026
What about the other half?

21:56.028 --> 22:00.013
No. Now listen, you've got to
get yourself psyched up, you see,

22:00.016 --> 22:04.046
because it's not only your romance
that's riding on this,

22:04.048 --> 22:08.029
it's my love life as well.
So you've got to make an effort.

22:08.031 --> 22:10.021
Effort?

22:10.023 --> 22:13.006
I mean... have some fun!

22:13.008 --> 22:15.059
Now, come along, it's fun time.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.079
Let that set, Gastric.

22:20.003 --> 22:25.077
If Madge won't come to Christmas,
then Christmas has to come to Madge.

22:25.079 --> 22:27.998
I've never been on a trampoline.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.013
Oh, there's nothing to it.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.066
It's the next best thing to flying.

22:32.067 --> 22:34.049
Maybe not to landing.

22:34.051 --> 22:35.998
Don't worry about...

22:36.000 --> 22:37.054
HORN BEEPS
Ah! Ah!

22:37.056 --> 22:39.026
Hey, watch it!
HORN BEEPS

22:39.028 --> 22:41.021
Move it around.

22:41.023 --> 22:43.006
Hey! Road hog.

22:43.008 --> 22:44.086
All right, c'mon.

22:44.087 --> 22:46.079
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!

22:48.076 --> 22:50.074
Do you mind?
HORN BEEPS

22:50.076 --> 22:54.038
Let's get this thing out of
the middle of the road, would you?

22:54.039 --> 22:56.057
Going to get run over.

22:56.059 --> 22:57.084
Shh, keep quiet.

23:01.023 --> 23:03.061
Ah. What are you doing?

23:03.064 --> 23:06.006
The beard, the beard's fast.

23:06.008 --> 23:08.046
No, don't pull it,
you'll pull me face off.

23:08.048 --> 23:10.086
That glue's really sticky.

23:10.087 --> 23:12.066
Keep your voice down. I'm in pain!

23:12.067 --> 23:14.082
Yeah, but being
really brave about it.

23:14.084 --> 23:16.029
Look, she's in.

23:16.031 --> 23:21.009
Never mind about the beard,
she needs to see his face anyway.

23:21.011 --> 23:23.046
TEARING
Ah! Ah!

23:23.048 --> 23:24.077
Oh! Ah!

23:24.079 --> 23:27.038
Shh! Shh, quiet. Shh!

23:27.039 --> 23:28.094
Will you be quiet?

23:28.096 --> 23:32.061
Quiet? That's the closest
shave I've had for a while.

23:32.064 --> 23:35.061
It's a good job you didn't
get your trousers fast.

23:35.064 --> 23:38.001
Now, don't stand
there looking at it,

23:38.003 --> 23:42.009
climb aboard,
feel the weightlessness.

23:42.011 --> 23:43.089
Enjoy yourself.

23:43.092 --> 23:45.998
How am I supposed to get up there?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.021
Oh, for heaven's sake,

23:48.023 --> 23:51.077
they never had this trouble with
the astronauts, did they?

23:51.079 --> 23:54.021
Right, just...
Come on, we'll give you a hand.

23:54.023 --> 23:57.034
Oh, me leg! Oh, me leg.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.076
Oh! Me leg! Put this one...

24:02.016 --> 24:06.076
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Leroy, go and get the steps, will ya?

24:27.084 --> 24:29.998
It won't stand still.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.077
Keep your voice down,
this is supposed to be a surprise!

24:33.079 --> 24:35.087
It is for me, I tell you.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.034
Get a grip, man, will ya?
Find your balance.

24:40.036 --> 24:41.069
Then what?

24:41.072 --> 24:44.026
Then you keep jumping,
that's right, then you get higher

24:44.028 --> 24:47.082
and higher and higher and
higher, you see.

24:47.084 --> 24:50.013
Good.
HE GRUNTS

24:50.016 --> 24:52.009
That's it, go on.
Jump up and down now.

24:52.011 --> 24:54.018
There, that's it.

24:54.019 --> 24:56.018
That's it! Go on, jump.

24:56.019 --> 24:57.048
Ah!

24:59.019 --> 25:00.056
Ow.

25:02.048 --> 25:05.092
You're going to have to get
more power behind it.

25:06.096 --> 25:08.048
Get bigger jumps.

25:22.071 --> 25:25.001
HE ROARS

25:25.003 --> 25:27.008
HE SHRIEKS

25:31.084 --> 25:34.087
LOUD CRASH
SHE LAUGHS

25:44.031 --> 25:47.044
THEY CHATTER

25:53.096 --> 25:57.057
I rescued my second
husband from a trampoline,

25:57.059 --> 26:00.009
her name was Sonia or
something equally bizarre.

26:00.011 --> 26:03.001
I warned him, she'd been jumped on
more times than I've had hot...

26:03.003 --> 26:07.041
Now then, Delphine,
put your claws away, it's Christmas.

26:07.044 --> 26:09.021
I'm sure she was harmless.

26:09.023 --> 26:10.054
Possibly...

26:10.056 --> 26:11.084
when not horizontal.

26:20.003 --> 26:22.084
Cyril has been telling me
you've got this stuff?

26:24.003 --> 26:26.008
Oh, Dr Proctor's Pick Me Up?

26:27.079 --> 26:29.021
Well, does it work on females?

26:29.023 --> 26:34.006
Well, it's fine for females,
it's for any upset stomachs.

26:34.008 --> 26:36.038
He never said anything about
upset stomachs.

26:36.039 --> 26:40.092
Oh, you mean the side effects?

26:43.016 --> 26:44.061
I'll take half a dozen.

26:44.064 --> 26:46.031
Good man. Good thinking.

26:49.084 --> 26:51.034
Ready when you are, Granville.

26:51.036 --> 26:53.021
Ready for what, Mrs Featherstone?

26:53.023 --> 26:56.038
Your mistletoe mince pies,
save me a dozen.

26:56.039 --> 26:58.048
I'll be in when you deliver.

27:12.084 --> 27:14.029
What you looking for?

27:14.031 --> 27:17.076
The mince pies,
we've got to destroy them.

27:18.087 --> 27:20.034
No, no.

27:20.036 --> 27:24.057
If anybody asks,
you tell them we've sold out.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.046
We have sold out.

27:26.048 --> 27:29.041
HE SIGHS HAPPILY

27:29.044 --> 27:31.044
Oh, Merry Christmas, Leroy.

27:35.044 --> 27:37.087
DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE

27:39.076 --> 27:44.034

a window is not something

'you see everyday.
