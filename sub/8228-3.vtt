WEBVTT

00:00.434 --> 00:03.268
Isode of "Mythbusters"...

00:03.270 --> 00:05.738
Ooh, that had some bass to it.

00:05.740 --> 00:08.240
We're asking if you combine
The right person...

00:08.242 --> 00:10.809
What do you think of the shirt?
With the right diet...

00:10.811 --> 00:12.578
To squeezing beefers.

00:12.580 --> 00:17.016
And the right circumstance,
Do you end up with an explosion?

00:17.018 --> 00:19.885
Could a malodorous
Sleeping bag backfire...

00:19.887 --> 00:21.620
Which fart do you fear more?

00:21.622 --> 00:23.288
Jon, yeah.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.591
Spark a campsite calamity?

00:26.961 --> 00:28.494
Then... One...

00:28.496 --> 00:30.496
Ooh! Heads up.

00:30.498 --> 00:33.165
Can a damaged
Domestic appliance...

00:33.167 --> 00:36.402
yeah.

00:36.404 --> 00:39.204
Really wreak havoc
On an innocent r.V.?

00:39.206 --> 00:41.740
When that water heater
Goes, and it will,

00:41.742 --> 00:42.975
I think it will cut a perfect.

00:42.977 --> 00:45.544
Cookiecutter shape
Right through that r.V.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.147
You know when brian puts his
Gloves on, it's business time.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.681
- Time to fire it up.
- Yeah.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.611
our first fable
Unfolds in a mythical location.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.113
That we like to call...

01:21.115 --> 01:22.848
Twin cheeks.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.316
Let's just get this
Out of the way.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.919
And explain what a dutch oven is
For those of you who don't know.

01:26.921 --> 01:29.221
A dutch oven is when
You're lying in bed.

01:29.223 --> 01:31.390
At the end of the day, nice and
Relaxed next to your partner,

01:31.392 --> 01:33.826
And all of a sudden you're like,
"What is that?"

01:33.828 --> 01:35.828
And they pull the bed sheets
Over your head,

01:35.830 --> 01:38.997
Forcing you to wallow
In their perfume.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.599
The story goes.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.035
That after sharing
A hearty campfire meal,

01:43.037 --> 01:46.338
A couple retire to their tent
And a double sleeping bag.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.074
The man lets off
A dutch oven blowout...

01:49.076 --> 01:51.443
Just as she lights a cigarette,

01:51.445 --> 01:54.980
And a practical joke ends
In camping catastrophe.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.051
It's the kind of
Bonding behavior.

01:59.053 --> 02:01.120
You'd think would
Ruin the romance.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.889
But could it actually
Stoke the fire?

02:05.292 --> 02:07.359
The only way to really
Test this myth,

02:07.361 --> 02:08.994
We're going to have
To collect some farts.

02:08.996 --> 02:10.294
And have them analyzed.

02:10.297 --> 02:13.732
You know, no one's going to
Donate their farts to us,

02:13.734 --> 02:16.802
So we're going to have
To collect our own.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.904
No problem. Pull my finger.

02:20.541 --> 02:21.773
The guys know.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.709
Their bottom burps
Are flammable,

02:23.711 --> 02:26.311
But it's worth finding out
If one or the other.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.181
Has more explosive potential.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.716
You've been thinking
About this, haven't you?

02:30.718 --> 02:32.384
I have.

02:32.386 --> 02:36.155
In fact, jon's given this
A lot of thought.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.090
You ever see those waders
That they go,

02:38.092 --> 02:39.958
You know, fly fishing with?
Yeah.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.394
They're waterproof, right? So...

02:42.396 --> 02:44.696
To brian's bemusement,
Jon whips up a blueprint.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.799
Of his patented fly fishing
Flatulence pants.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.902
Seal it up there so there's
No weird air pockets.

02:49.904 --> 02:53.005
Or anything like that,
And then bob is your uncle.

02:53.007 --> 02:56.175
That is awfully Impressive, jon.

02:56.177 --> 02:58.577
I think I'm going to take
A different route.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.212
Than you, though.

03:00.214 --> 03:04.449
And that would be
The... ahem... direct route.

03:04.451 --> 03:09.354
Insert tube a into slot b
Allowing access to bag c.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.790
That's enough said.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.360
Hope we got lube.

03:19.066 --> 03:22.501
Our next fable asks,
Can a quakeandshake.

03:22.503 --> 03:25.204
Turn a water heater
Into a rocket?

03:25.206 --> 03:27.873
This is a myth
Of successive disasters.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.908
First, the tremor.

03:29.910 --> 03:33.078
A longneglected water heater
Is badly shaken.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.581
And goes horizontal.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.149
The already damaged heater.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.650
Starts building pressure...

03:38.652 --> 03:40.852
Resulting in
A catastrophic failure.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.956
And a 700pound torpedo.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.058
The steampowered missile
Punctures the wall.

03:46.060 --> 03:49.094
Before blasting a hole
Through an r.V. Outside.

03:49.096 --> 03:52.397
Unlikely occurrence or genuine
Cause for concern?

03:58.439 --> 04:00.205
Man, this is going
To be awesome.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.074
I know, right? There's nothing
More "Mythbusters".

04:02.076 --> 04:04.743
Than turning a household
Appliance into a rocket.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.911
- Right?
- All right.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.379
So how are we going
To test this?

04:07.381 --> 04:09.982
We're going to fire a water
Tank torpedo through an r.V.

04:09.984 --> 04:12.184
Love it.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.552
I think we should start with
The specific circumstances.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.954
Of this myth and test the
Orientation of the water heater.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.223
Like horizontal versus vertical?
Exactly.

04:18.225 --> 04:20.524
See how that effects
The mechanics of the launch.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.494
What do you say we start
With some water bottle rockets.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.062
And see how those go?

04:24.064 --> 04:26.565
Brian, you had me at rockets.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.134
Whoa!

04:29.136 --> 04:31.003
Brian and jon have
Already dabbled.

04:31.005 --> 04:34.039
With rocket water heaters
In the "Search" finale...

04:34.041 --> 04:36.975
When a mythical prisoner.

04:36.977 --> 04:40.245
Made his unconventional
Bust for freedom.

04:40.247 --> 04:43.582
Yes! It worked!

04:43.584 --> 04:46.018
Filling a vessel 3/4 with water.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.987
Not only gives maximum
Explosive potential,

04:48.989 --> 04:53.392
It also minimizes the chance of
Prematurely rupturing the tank.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.730
So they're using the same ratio
For their smallscale tests.

04:58.732 --> 04:59.998
With bottle rockets.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.702
Powered by 40 p.S.I.
Of compressed air.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.137
So out here we're
Going to figure out.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.172
If there's a difference
Between a vertical launch.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.974
And a horizontal launch,

05:08.976 --> 05:10.976
Because this is what
The myth is about, right?

05:10.978 --> 05:12.477
Perfect.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.913
The first firing aims
Straight for the skies.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.082
- Ready to fire!
- Get back here.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.884
All right. Water bottle rocket.

05:18.886 --> 05:22.954
Vertical test
In three, two, one.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.157
- Ooh! Heads up.
- Watch out.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.492
Here we go.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.262
I always enjoy those, man.
That was very nice.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.266
Okay, let's take a look
At that high speed.

05:34.268 --> 05:35.667
Ooh!

05:35.669 --> 05:38.603
That's such a beautiful launch.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.572
That's about 39 Feet per second.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.075
Hey, that's not bad.

05:43.077 --> 05:45.944
So what changes
In a horizontal launch?

05:45.946 --> 05:49.214
For one thing, there's a major
Shift in the ballast.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.316
Come take a look at this.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.985
Right now the air is sitting
On top of the water this way,

05:53.987 --> 05:55.554
But before when
We launched it vertically,

05:55.556 --> 05:57.422
It was sitting this way.

05:57.424 --> 05:59.591
So we want to see if the change
In orientation affects.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.561
How much pressure we get
And also how fast it will go.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.529
Charging it up.

06:04.531 --> 06:05.964
That's good.

06:05.966 --> 06:10.902
Horizontal bottle rocket test
In three, two, one.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.608
That was energetic.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.744
To see just how energetic,

06:18.746 --> 06:20.078
It's off to the high speed.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.149
So all the water Is down...

06:24.151 --> 06:25.317
Right. But look.

06:25.319 --> 06:26.651
As it begins to accelerate...

06:26.653 --> 06:28.186
The force of the
Acceleration drives.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.722
All the water to the back.
That's awesome.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.725
So it's kind of acting like
A normal vertical launch.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.660
After about 8 inches there.

06:35.662 --> 06:39.998
Okay, and it looks like it is
61 feet per second.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.733
That's faster than
The vertical launch.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.536
I think that's real
Interesting for the myth.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.438
Without gravity Holding it back,

06:46.440 --> 06:51.810
The rocket packs even more of
A punch fired horizontally.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.846
We launched both our water
Heater bottles at 40 p.S.I.

06:54.848 --> 06:58.517
Our vertical one went up
At 39 feet per second.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.986
Our horizontal,
61 feet per second.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.521
That was unexpected.

07:02.523 --> 07:05.657
That looks really good
For our water heater myth.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.292
And that's
A green light to proceed.

07:07.294 --> 07:10.562
To seriously mangling some
Household hardware.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.797
Yeah, I think it's actually
Time we fired.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.298
Some real water heaters. Yeah.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.839
, Some real water heaters.
Igniting flammable gas.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.074
Has been
A "Mythbusters" hallmark.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.214
But this time around,
It's more personal.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.950
- God, I...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

07:31.952 --> 07:33.819
Can a dutch oven be deadly?

07:33.821 --> 07:36.087
We're asking if you combine
The right person...

07:37.090 --> 07:39.791
With the right diet...

07:39.793 --> 07:44.062
And the right circumstance,
Do you end up with an explosion?

07:44.064 --> 07:46.364
That's the myth, and that's
What we're going to test.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.999
First up,

07:48.001 --> 07:50.635
They need to wrangle
Some rump rippers.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.571
Jon's building
A fishing pants filter.

07:53.874 --> 07:56.041
Let's just say it's
An intricate interplay.

07:56.043 --> 07:59.478
Of hoses, pipes and holes.

07:59.480 --> 08:03.014
And voilà, we've got a fresh
Bag of my backdoor breeze.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.383
Now I've just got to
Fill it with water.

08:05.385 --> 08:08.220
And in the true spirit
Of exploiting useful things.

08:08.222 --> 08:10.155
In ways never intended...

08:13.494 --> 08:15.227
Ooh!

08:15.229 --> 08:19.264
Jon's using waterproof
Pants to hold in the h2o.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.299
The whole idea of this
Is that the wind

08:21.301 --> 08:23.435
I eventually pass
Gets trapped in the water.

08:23.437 --> 08:25.036
Then it bubbles up
For collection.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.939
That way I get a pure fart
With no outside contaminants.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.008
Well, that's the theory anyway.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.409
I'm afraid...

08:32.412 --> 08:34.546
Of what I've become.

08:34.548 --> 08:38.015
I was concerned the tube
Was the bad choice.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.851
You'll never Catch me, brian!

08:39.852 --> 08:41.486
After walking around a bit,

08:41.488 --> 08:44.956
Jon finds a flaw
In his flatulence catchers.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.491
Whoo!

08:46.493 --> 08:49.427
The more water they add,
The more they stretch.

08:49.429 --> 08:52.864
Just go from the foot and wrap
Tape as tight as you can.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.400
Because I feel like this thing
Is going to give out soon.

08:55.402 --> 08:59.504
This is the funniest thing I've
Done in my entire life, jon.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.273
Okay.

09:01.275 --> 09:03.608
I honestly didn't think these
Things would stretch very much,

09:03.610 --> 09:05.310
But they did,
And so that's why I had

09:05.312 --> 09:09.614
Brian squeeze me into the pants,
Or squeeze the pants into me,

09:09.616 --> 09:11.116
And I think we
Solved our problem.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.518
Except it's a little wet.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.087
So they're all set
To harvest some bubbles...

09:16.089 --> 09:17.222
- jon.
- Yeah?

09:17.224 --> 09:19.190
The gas station's ready.
Come fuel up.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.459
Once the furnace
Is properly stoked.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.094
Ooh, nice!

09:23.096 --> 09:24.996
We got quite the spread.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.865
Can we just start eating?
Eat away, my friend.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.533
Dude!

09:28.535 --> 09:29.935
There we go. Yeah.

09:31.438 --> 09:34.306
People naturally produce varying
Amounts of methane and hydrogen.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.575
As flammable gasses
In their farts,

09:36.577 --> 09:38.143
But we can influence that.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.679
Meat for the methane.
Fiber for the hydrogen.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.114
We'll throw in some co2
To increase the volume.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.382
To squeezing beefers.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.951
Yeah. Cheers.

09:45.953 --> 09:49.020
I love to eat, so the fact
That I'm doing it for science.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.423
Just makes it all that
Much more delicious.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.425
- How's the wings?
- It's actually really good.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.026
All the things that
Help me crank out.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.362
Those sweet, Sweet air tulips.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.897
There you go.

09:58.899 --> 10:02.300
Although we pass gas
On average 14 times a day...

10:02.302 --> 10:03.501
Nothing still.

10:03.503 --> 10:06.404
Few have the talent
To do it on cue.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.139
Exercise can help.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.908
Brian, brian, brian,
Brian, brian, brian.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.576
Come here real quick.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.111
I have a gift for you.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.446
Wait.

10:15.849 --> 10:18.149
That's a small one,
But it's a start.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.652
It's a start, man. It's working.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.153
It sure is.

10:22.155 --> 10:25.223
Within the hour, they've both
Baked enough brownies.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.258
For a professional analysis.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.995
It doesn't look like much, but
That's a good volume of fart.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.364
Even though they just
Ate the same food,

10:32.366 --> 10:34.633
They're about to discover
That one sample.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.935
Is fundamentally
Far more flammable.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.004
All right. Got to get
These off to the lab.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.905
Yeah, handle with care.

10:44.277 --> 10:47.479
If launching domestic
Water heaters has taught us.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.980
Anything over the years...

10:50.484 --> 10:54.085
I see a hole in the roof, man!

10:54.087 --> 10:57.422
It's that it's best done
In wide open spaces.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.990
Here it comes.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.225
I never get tired of that.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.332
Brian and jon have located
A prime piece of acreage.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.234
That should fit the bill.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.673
This place looks tailormade
For launching water heaters.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.174
Yeah, real nice.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.477
But before going full scale,
They've decided to field test.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.579
A smaller 12gallon heater.

11:21.581 --> 11:24.082
What did we get?
What did we get?

11:24.084 --> 11:25.717
Yeah, a water heater!

11:25.719 --> 11:28.987
First, it's off with the
Primary failsafe features,

11:28.989 --> 11:31.523
The thermostat and
The pressurerelease valve.

11:31.525 --> 11:32.991
Yeah.

11:32.993 --> 11:36.528
It's been standard practice for
Every water heater myth to date,

11:36.530 --> 11:38.963
Replacing the safeties
With gauges.

11:38.965 --> 11:42.333
To track the tank's
Vital statistics.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.768
So when we launch
This water heater,

11:43.770 --> 11:45.136
We're going to want
To do the same thing.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.706
By keeping track of temperature
With this thermocouple.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.641
And pressure with
This pressure transducer.

11:49.643 --> 11:51.676
Should we set the thermostat.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.611
On very hot or crazy hot?

11:55.816 --> 11:58.316
Once the tank's
Filled to the magic 3/4 mark...

11:58.318 --> 12:00.218
All right. Wiring's set.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.054
It's good to blow.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.689
Well, all the heavy
Lifting is done.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.958
All we have to do now
Is wait and, you know,

12:06.960 --> 12:08.827
These things take a long,

12:08.829 --> 12:10.428
Long time to build
Pressure and blow,

12:10.430 --> 12:11.863
So I'm going to leave That you.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.298
I'm going to go back to the shop
And start building.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.733
Our tipping rig. You sure?

12:14.735 --> 12:16.534
Yeah, just bring back some
Beautiful highspeed footage.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.604
- Absolutely.
- All right. Good luck.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.942
With jon back at the workshop,
It's all up to brian.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.810
To give this midscale missile.

12:25.812 --> 12:28.079
Its very best shot.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.082
Remember, this myth's about
The water heater in the garage.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.917
Being knocked over
By an earthquake,

12:32.919 --> 12:36.321
Launching horizontally
And blasting a hole in an r.V.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.757
We've got our water heater in
Its horizontal launch position.

12:38.759 --> 12:39.924
Ready to go.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.826
Temperature
And pressure sensors in.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.928
All plumbed up, Just the wiring.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.396
So in order to get some data,

12:45.398 --> 12:46.965
We've set up our Highspeed scale.

12:46.967 --> 12:50.401
So we can track both the
Velocity and the trajectory.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.906
When it's all set,
Brian retreats to the bunker.

12:54.908 --> 12:58.376
For what could be
A very long wait.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.445
When we first start
Energizing our water heater,

13:00.447 --> 13:03.047
We see a really slow
Buildup of pressure,

13:03.049 --> 13:06.551
And what we're seeing is the
Water converting into steam,

13:06.553 --> 13:09.020
Filling that air gap,
And that steam in the air gap.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.955
Is where the pressure
Comes from.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.124
The pressure,
It's getting to me!

13:13.126 --> 13:16.027
And that pressure is 43 p.S.I.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.796
As the heating water expands,

13:17.798 --> 13:20.398
There's increasingly
Less space for the steam,

13:20.400 --> 13:22.734
And so the slow rise
In pressure.

13:22.736 --> 13:24.569
Brian knows it's not
Likely to blow.

13:24.571 --> 13:28.873
Till the pressure hits at least
320 pounds per square inch,

13:28.875 --> 13:30.542
And that's still a ways off.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.644
I wonder if jon's having
As much fun building.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.679
As I am out here.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.449
And then there'll
Be a thing here.

13:38.451 --> 13:42.387
And a rope will go<I> whoop!</I>

13:42.389 --> 13:46.758
Seems he is.
Chalk that up to prebuild buzz.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.426
This myth requires that we tip.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.930
A almostreadytoexplode
Water heater on its side,

13:51.932 --> 13:53.731
And as hilarious
As it would be for me.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.534
And brian to run out there
And tip it over by hand,

13:56.536 --> 13:59.137
For obvious safety reasons
We're not going to do that.

13:59.139 --> 14:03.341
So instead, I'm going
To build a rig.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.009
Water heater teeter.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.145
All right. Up top, brian.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.950
With a filled
65gallon water heater.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.619
Weighing upwards of 700 pounds,

14:14.621 --> 14:17.622
The tipping rig needs to be
As sturdy as jon can make it.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.824
This will be the platform
Our water heater sits on,

14:19.826 --> 14:22.927
So when it's about to explode,
We'll collapse the legs in,

14:22.929 --> 14:24.229
Swing the platform down,

14:24.231 --> 14:26.331
Transforming it
Into our launch pad.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.566
That will direct the water
Heater right into the r.V.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.641
back in the bunker,
The pressure is building.

14:38.812 --> 14:40.912
Any moment now.

14:45.318 --> 14:48.186
Wow!

14:48.188 --> 14:50.588
Holy.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.224
That was powerful.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.159
And that was An understatement.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.996
It was more like
A bomb going off.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.598
You have your temperature
Up at 420 degrees,

15:00.600 --> 15:04.269
We get up to 335 p.S.I.
And then, boom!

15:04.271 --> 15:08.673
It hits you
In the chest so solid.

15:08.675 --> 15:12.243
But it did launch,
Which is great for the myth.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.945
Now we've just go to figure out
Where the tank is.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.647
And see how fast
It went on high speed.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.118
Any doubts that
A horizontal water heater.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.521
Could go the distance
Have just been blown away.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.625
There it is.

15:27.627 --> 15:31.963
Hit at the bottom of that hill,
Slid along, cartwheeled up some,

15:31.965 --> 15:34.499
Bounced off the top
Through a whole bunch of trees,

15:34.501 --> 15:37.368
Landing about 50 feet from
The top of the hill right here.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.140
It's not every home appliance
That can launch itself.

15:42.142 --> 15:46.444
The length of three
Football fields and up a hill.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.047
That's incredible.

15:49.049 --> 15:52.483
Seems the myth is
On track, and what a track.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.159
To test the myth seems the myth
is On track, and what a track.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.194
Of the exploding dutch oven,

16:03.196 --> 16:05.029
Jon and brian Have each captured.

16:05.031 --> 16:08.366
Some sample exhaust fumes
For expert analysis.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.735
We've got your farts.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.371
And the rather
Comprehensive results are in.

16:13.373 --> 16:16.307
I don't know if I gave you
This much gas to analyze.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.143
Val mallari
Of air technology laboratories.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.379
Normally tests things like
Landfill emissions.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.847
For the e.P.A.,

16:22.849 --> 16:25.149
So breaking down
A couple of butt blasts.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.417
Is a relative breeze.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.752
How did you do, brian?

16:27.754 --> 16:32.657
I got 4.8% hydrogen
And .01, so almost no methane.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.226
- How about you?
- Wow, really? Let's see.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.862
Hydrogen... 17% by volume.

16:39.165 --> 16:43.034
And methane... 4.4%.

16:43.036 --> 16:46.537
It looks a lot like a landfill
Gas sample, actually.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.006
There we go.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.641
That sounds like
An accomplishment to me.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.144
Methane and hydrogen
Are the two key.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.179
Combustible gasses
In flatulence.

16:55.181 --> 16:58.349
The balance of one to the other
Can differ widely,

16:58.351 --> 17:01.119
Most likely due to the
Different types of bacteria.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.653
Found from gut to gut.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.356
So, as a professional,
I want to ask you,

17:05.358 --> 17:07.657
Which fart do you fear more?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.961
Jon, yeah. Yeah, def...

17:09.963 --> 17:11.762
We had to dispose of it
Differently than yours.

17:11.765 --> 17:13.131
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.799
This amount of data
Is fantastic.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.468
It gives us that baseline
We need to really see.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.304
What sort of dumptype mixture
We need for the explosion here.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.707
- Thank you.
- Yeah, my pleasure. Thank you.

17:22.709 --> 17:27.211
That's a perfect cue
To start blowing things up,

17:27.213 --> 17:28.780
Filled with different mixtures.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.882
Of noxious vapors.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.184
So we have your baseline
And my baseline to start with,

17:33.186 --> 17:35.953
So we'll need some kind of rig
To measure and dispense gas.

17:35.955 --> 17:39.457
Mix them within that range and
Get the biggest fart possible.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.626
The need for precision
Is paramount,

17:41.628 --> 17:45.963
And this is where
Jon comes into his own.

17:45.965 --> 17:49.400
His custom gas delivery device
Is even more complex.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.769
Than his fartcatching
Water pants.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.137
Here's how it works.

17:53.139 --> 17:55.406
We start by taking
These two tanks.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.908
And filling our
Reservoir balloons.

17:56.910 --> 18:00.011
Respectively with
Hydrogen and methane.

18:00.013 --> 18:04.115
Then we come over to the valve,
Open one that allows me.

18:04.117 --> 18:08.019
To draw one of the gasses
Into the chamber.

18:08.021 --> 18:10.655
Then we can close off
The gas valve.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.723
And open the one
To our target balloon.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.526
Where I can then...

18:15.528 --> 18:18.162
Fill it up here.

18:18.164 --> 18:20.865
And when we're all ready,
We'll just take it, tie it off,

18:20.867 --> 18:23.935
Over to the high speed
And... Measure the boom.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.673
As for getting The ratios right,

18:28.675 --> 18:30.508
Well, brian's done the math.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.477
I've looked at our two reports.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.679
Mine basically has
Trace methane,

18:34.681 --> 18:37.248
Such little amounts that
They don't even interact.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.516
- Okay.
- So we're going to do

18:38.518 --> 18:40.785
100% hydrogen For my balloon.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.121
Yours is about
A fourtoone ratio,

18:43.123 --> 18:46.057
So we'll do four parts hydrogen
To one part methane.

18:46.059 --> 18:47.758
Here we go.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.228
It's all hands to the pumps
As both balloons.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.430
Are filled
With surrogate steamers.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.901
- Hydrogen four.
- There you go.

18:56.903 --> 18:59.737
Watching explosions is fun,
But we need to collect data,

18:59.739 --> 19:02.440
Which is why we have this
Radial highspeed scale.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.041
So that when we ignite our gas,

19:04.043 --> 19:07.111
We can measure the speed
And the size of the explosion.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.546
All right.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.282
Igniter at the ready
And blast screen in place,

19:11.284 --> 19:13.551
They'll burst
Brian's balloon first.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.854
Brian fart that's 100% hydrogen.

19:16.856 --> 19:20.391
In three, two, one.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.829
Ooh, that had some Bass to it.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.832
- Pretty good.
- Very nice.

19:27.834 --> 19:31.469
Let's see if your little
Gas blast is any better.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.505
Will more methane
Result in more mayhem?

19:34.507 --> 19:37.275
We're about to find out.
All right.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.777
Jon's gas ratio...
Methane to hydrogen.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.412
Is one to four.

19:41.414 --> 19:44.815
In three, two, one.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.819
That's a little bigger looking.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.855
It makes me proud.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.356
Didn't have the bass
To it, though.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.292
Really?
I don't know. I didn't feel it.

19:54.294 --> 19:57.929
To best appreciate
The explosive art of the fart,

19:57.931 --> 19:59.463
It's off to the high speed.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.832
Brian's blast is first.

20:01.834 --> 20:05.536
That's beautiful.
So majestic for a fart.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.907
Let's switch over
To my gaseous balloon.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.677
Jon's methane mix
Is just as majestic...

20:12.679 --> 20:15.012
- that's pretty cool.
- That's beautiful.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.215
Which isn't helping them
Dial this one in.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.983
They look more or less The same.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.451
I think we're missing The oxygen.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.120
That would be
In the sleeping bag, the air.

20:23.122 --> 20:25.756
Adding oxygen to each of
The samples makes sense,

20:25.758 --> 20:28.092
And it just might have
A more pronounced effect.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.660
On one than the other,

20:29.662 --> 20:32.730
So it's time to add
Fuel to this fire.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.733
So this one is 50% hydrogen,

20:35.735 --> 20:38.302
And then there's 50% air.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.104
It's the brian
Dutch oven balloon.

20:40.106 --> 20:44.308
In three, two, one.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.614
In three, two, one.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.215
Of the earthquake
Water heater...

20:51.217 --> 20:53.251
Wow!

20:53.253 --> 20:57.688
Our diligent duo
Briefly went solo.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.358
Jon built a solid
Steel heater teeter.

21:03.062 --> 21:07.265
And brian made
A 12gallon tank torpedo.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.267
We found an impact point.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.801
Wow!

21:10.803 --> 21:14.805
Now the team's
Reunited to swap notes.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.707
- Hey, jon.
- Here, hold this.

21:16.709 --> 21:17.875
This is fantastic.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.478
It's a mighty solid piece
Of construction,

21:20.480 --> 21:23.481
But after hearing brian's
Tale from the test site...

21:23.483 --> 21:24.649
Boom!

21:24.651 --> 21:26.584
Everything's just gone
In a blink.

21:26.586 --> 21:29.854
Your rig is in shambles.

21:29.856 --> 21:32.657
And seeing The high speed...

21:32.659 --> 21:34.225
That's it, yeah.

21:34.227 --> 21:37.028
Jon's suddenly not sure
It's solid enough.

21:37.030 --> 21:39.063
My old rig looks like someone
Took my tinfoil.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.666
From a sandwich and went... <i>buh.</i>

21:41.668 --> 21:43.467
And so I'm looking
At my fullscale rig,

21:43.469 --> 21:45.836
And this is 2by2
Quarterinch box steel.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.506
That I've seen survive
Explosions before,

21:48.508 --> 21:52.209
And I'm wondering if I'm just
Feeding the larger water heater.

21:52.211 --> 21:53.711
A bigger ball of tinfoil.

21:59.218 --> 22:00.718
Given the explosion
Will generate.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.788
Almost 100,000 pounds of force,

22:03.790 --> 22:05.823
Jon has grounds for concern.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.693
Still, they decide the rig
Should hold together.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.494
And it's time to go full scale.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.130
That smallscale test Was insane.

22:13.132 --> 22:17.268
In 3 feet, the water heater
Got up to 320 miles an hour.

22:17.270 --> 22:20.404
If you think about it, sound
Moves at 770 miles an hour,

22:20.406 --> 22:21.906
So this water heater was moving.

22:21.908 --> 22:24.075
Just under half
The speed of sound.

22:25.578 --> 22:28.312
But as it took off,
It went vertical.

22:28.314 --> 22:31.682
D remember, this myth is about
Punching a hole in that r.V.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.418
but before the r.V.,
It needs to burst clean.

22:34.420 --> 22:38.122
Through the side of a building.

22:38.124 --> 22:41.792
So here, in the middle
Of nowhere...

22:41.794 --> 22:43.961
Facing that way. That way?

22:43.963 --> 22:48.199
The crew pulls together for
An oldfashioned garage raising.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.935
- Keep it vertical.
- Ooh, what's that jiggling?

22:50.937 --> 22:53.270
That's an earthquake, jon.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.807
This is no flimsy prop.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.509
The structure itself
Should stand up.

22:58.511 --> 23:01.479
To at least a midranged tremor.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.581
- Very nice.
- -very nice.

23:07.320 --> 23:10.287
The key component
Is jon's drop rig,

23:10.289 --> 23:12.590
And it looks like
They've done their homework.

23:12.592 --> 23:13.958
It's a perfect fit.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.227
No, you're good. Just drop it.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.762
What do you think, brian?

23:17.764 --> 23:19.563
It's a beast of a stand, man.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.265
- You want a quick demo?
- Please.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.601
- Okay, so...
- am I safe here?

23:23.603 --> 23:27.071
You might want to just
Take a step outside.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.173
That's beautiful, man.

23:29.175 --> 23:32.109
Their attention to detail
Is more than impressive.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.577
Gently.

23:33.579 --> 23:37.448
Craftsmanship? Not so much.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.550
That worked great, jon.

23:39.552 --> 23:41.619
Well, good thing this house
Is about to blow up.

23:44.390 --> 23:46.157
I ruined our cabin!

23:47.727 --> 23:50.161
And if the myth
Really is on the level...

23:50.163 --> 23:51.729
<i>straighten her up.</i>

23:51.731 --> 23:54.899
A muchloved motor home
Might go the same way.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.901
This is the family r.V.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.602
We've had it for generations.

23:58.604 --> 24:03.407
It was my greatgreatgreat-
Greatgreatgreatgrandpapa's.

24:03.409 --> 24:06.510
He bought it brand new,
And we love this thing dearly.

24:06.512 --> 24:08.412
Last on stage
Is the star of this.

24:08.414 --> 24:10.014
Shaky domestic drama.

24:10.016 --> 24:13.284
It's as big as brian and,
When filled with water,

24:13.286 --> 24:15.786
Weighs more than two
Upright pianos.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.455
- Will this fit through the door?
- I don't know.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.823
- Here we go.
- We might have to rotate.

24:18.825 --> 24:19.957
Slightly for me.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.192
Ooh, nice.

24:21.194 --> 24:23.027
There we go.

24:23.029 --> 24:26.330
Like a glove.

24:26.332 --> 24:28.699
- We're in.
- Okay, let's tilt it up.

24:28.701 --> 24:31.335
Yeah.

24:31.337 --> 24:32.770
Here we go.

24:36.476 --> 24:39.677
This is our water heater
Earthquake rig all set up.

24:39.679 --> 24:43.113
Water heater, stand,
And emergency release valve.

24:43.115 --> 24:45.349
So when it's about ready
To blow, brian and I.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.551
Will pull the string,
Kicking the leg in,

24:47.553 --> 24:49.787
Causing this whole tower
To go boom!

24:51.257 --> 24:53.157
The planning so far
Has been flawless,

24:53.159 --> 24:55.493
But the same can't be said
For the heater.

24:55.495 --> 25:01.131
It's been deliberately doctored
To be highly unstable.

25:01.133 --> 25:02.633
One thing the mythbusters know.

25:02.635 --> 25:05.135
Is when these things
Get squirrelly...

25:07.006 --> 25:09.807
Mayhem is just moments away.

25:15.114 --> 25:19.817
To get the best gas ratio
For an explosive dutch oven,

25:19.819 --> 25:22.319
The guys are comparing
Their own flank fissures.

25:22.321 --> 25:26.056
It looks a lot like a landfill
Gas sample, actually.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.525
Here we go.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.860
They know oxygen has
To be part of the mix...

25:29.862 --> 25:32.596
It makes me proud.

25:32.598 --> 25:35.599
So they've added
Air to brian's hydrogen.

25:35.601 --> 25:38.402
So this one is 50% hydrogen.

25:38.404 --> 25:40.938
And then there's 50% air.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.773
It's the brian dutch oven
Balloon.

25:42.775 --> 25:46.510
Three... Two... One.

25:48.548 --> 25:49.647
Ooh.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.651
That was better.

25:53.653 --> 25:54.919
Adding air.

25:54.921 --> 25:57.288
Gave a bigger boom
To brian's butt breeze.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.056
So how will jon's fare?

25:59.058 --> 26:01.325
One methane, four hydrogen,

26:01.327 --> 26:02.960
And five air.

26:02.962 --> 26:05.262
In three, two, one.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.967
That was pretty good.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.436
Both blasts are impressive,

26:12.438 --> 26:15.005
But they've noted one
Critical difference...

26:15.007 --> 26:15.906
The speed.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.342
Ooh.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.144
It looks like yours
Was about half a second...

26:21.080 --> 26:23.614
And mine was about
Half of half of a second.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.149
- So like a quarter?
- Yeah.

26:25.151 --> 26:28.485
Okay, so that means that your
Fart was more of a explosion.

26:28.487 --> 26:29.954
And mine was kind of a burn...
yeah.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.655
And the myth says explosion.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.857
It's a personal setback for jon,

26:33.859 --> 26:37.261
But he needs to remember
There's no "I" in fart.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.495
When I got the lab results back.

26:38.497 --> 26:40.197
And I saw those high peaks
In my fart results,

26:40.199 --> 26:42.666
I thought that my farts
Would be more explosive,

26:42.668 --> 26:45.369
But it turns out
Brian's hydrogen fart.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.204
Burns twice as fast,

26:47.206 --> 26:48.906
Which makes it closer
To an explosion.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.674
Which is what
The myth calls for.

26:50.676 --> 26:53.777
So although
Jon's methane had a longer burn,

26:53.779 --> 26:58.315
It looks like brian's hydrogen-
Heavy sample is the way to blow.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.084
Now it's time for
The containment device...

27:00.086 --> 27:01.318
A sleeping bag.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.287
Now, sleeping bags
Aren't airtight.

27:03.289 --> 27:07.057
We need to test just to see
How much gas it might leak.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.258
To find out how much gas.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.727
We're leaking
From our sleeping bags,

27:09.729 --> 27:11.362
We have a fun new toy
In the shop.

27:11.364 --> 27:14.465
It's a thermal imaging camera
Except, unlike other ones,

27:14.467 --> 27:18.469
It allows us to see gasses
That are otherwise invisible.

27:18.471 --> 27:19.670
Ooh, I see it.

27:19.672 --> 27:20.771
Where's it coming from?

27:20.773 --> 27:23.007
It's coming from that
Back corner.

27:23.009 --> 27:25.943
Come take a look, jon. It's kind
Of coming from the whole thing.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.745
- You see all the vapor...
- ooh!

27:27.747 --> 27:29.813
Coming off from everywhere.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.349
As suspected,
A standard sleeping bag.

27:32.351 --> 27:35.085
Leaks somewhat from the zip
And the seams,

27:35.087 --> 27:37.388
But there might be
A simple solution.

27:37.390 --> 27:39.990
It's that cold country
Camping essential...

27:39.992 --> 27:41.191
The space blanket.

27:41.193 --> 27:43.827
Ooh, shiny!

27:43.829 --> 27:46.697
Technically,
This stuff is called bopet,

27:46.699 --> 27:49.566
And, believe me,
That's the condensed version.

27:49.568 --> 27:53.570
Okay, let's just put it right
Where the butt would be.

27:53.572 --> 27:55.706
- Zip him up, brian.
- All right.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.341
- Ready?
- Yeah, let's see some gas.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.009
Okay.

27:59.011 --> 28:02.713
Where do you see it?

28:02.715 --> 28:04.815
Actually, I'm not
Seeing anything.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.250
Come take a look.

28:06.252 --> 28:07.851
There's no doubt
The space blanket.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.586
Limits the leakage.

28:09.588 --> 28:12.356
It's now time to gather
Their camping supplies.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.791
And put this myth to bed.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.025
You're taking all
The sheets, bro.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.627
You always do this.

28:18.798 --> 28:22.166
The campsite they've
Chosen is strictly no pets...

28:22.168 --> 28:24.735
Welcome to camp tootalotee.

28:24.737 --> 28:25.903
And for that,

28:25.905 --> 28:27.671
Bo should be counting
Her blessings.

28:27.673 --> 28:30.674
Three... Two... One.

28:37.483 --> 28:38.816
Licate the myth.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.318
Of an r.V.-puncturing
Water heater torpedo,

28:41.320 --> 28:44.388
The guys have painstakingly
Set the scene.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.257
One thing they can't
Reproduce is an earthquake...

28:47.259 --> 28:48.792
Yeah.

28:48.794 --> 28:51.261
So jon's built a steel frame
To topple the heater.

28:51.263 --> 28:55.099
Deployed by a very long rope
That he'll pull from the bunker.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.835
So when it's ready,
It's going to go...

28:57.837 --> 28:59.136
Then it's anyone's guess.

28:59.138 --> 29:02.339
When all hell might break loose.

29:03.676 --> 29:04.875
For this myth to be confirmed,

29:04.877 --> 29:06.744
The water heater needs
To destroy the garage.

29:06.746 --> 29:09.446
And leave a big hole In our r.V.

29:09.448 --> 29:10.748
What's my prediction?

29:10.750 --> 29:12.583
Well, I think the water heater
Is going to teeter,

29:12.585 --> 29:15.119
Topple over,
Then explode like a rocket.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.887
But will it blast
Through the r.V.?

29:16.889 --> 29:18.455
I'm not so sure.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.057
I mean, it's thin metal up top,

29:20.059 --> 29:21.291
But what it will
Really depend on.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.961
Is the trajectory
Of the water heater.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.283
- It's time to fire it up?
- Yeah.

29:26.799 --> 29:29.533
My prediction is
Massive amounts of destruction.

29:29.535 --> 29:32.169
No organized, little,
Beautiful hole for this myth,

29:32.171 --> 29:35.072
But instead just glorious boom.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.107
We saw so much energy
On the small scale,

29:37.109 --> 29:41.011
I imagine the house and the r.V.
Are just going to be gone.

29:41.013 --> 29:43.814
With the generator cranked up,

29:43.816 --> 29:46.750
The guys retreat to
The safety of the bunker.

29:46.752 --> 29:49.353
How long do you think it's going
To take this thing to be ready?

29:49.355 --> 29:51.188
I'd go with an hour.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.422
- An hour?
- Yeah.

29:52.424 --> 29:55.759
I'm going to go an hour
And 15 minutes.

29:55.761 --> 29:57.728
All right.
Loser cleans up the mess?

29:57.730 --> 29:59.429
- Deal.
- All right.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.131
But as the minutes tick by,

30:01.133 --> 30:03.734
It looks like they've
Both lost the bet.

30:03.736 --> 30:05.502
All right. Heads up.

30:05.504 --> 30:10.174
319 degrees fahrenheit
And 129 p.S.I.

30:10.176 --> 30:15.112
And it's been an hour
And 17 minutes.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.751
245.

30:20.753 --> 30:22.252
They both know the plan...

30:22.254 --> 30:26.123
You know when brian puts his
Gloves on, it's business time.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.291
But when the time comes.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.259
To send the heater horizontal...

30:29.261 --> 30:30.961
All right. 280 p.S.I.

30:30.963 --> 30:33.497
I'm pulling the slack.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.734
Come on, slack.

30:37.736 --> 30:39.970
There's a major
Snag right off the bat.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.305
- You've got to go.
- I'm going to go.

30:41.307 --> 30:44.508
- We're getting up to burst.
- I'm going to go.

30:44.510 --> 30:45.409
The rope that was meant.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.311
To collapse the rig's legs.

30:47.313 --> 30:50.781
Is so long that the whole crew
Is needed to take up the slack.

30:50.783 --> 30:52.916
- Is it going?
- We're getting close now.

30:52.918 --> 30:54.451
We might have
A vertical water heater.

30:54.453 --> 30:55.686
Nope.

30:58.290 --> 31:01.058
If the heater stays
Upright and still explodes...

31:01.060 --> 31:03.660
Grab...

31:03.662 --> 31:06.563
They'll have blown
It in the worst possible way.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.732
What the? Pull, tommy.

31:13.873 --> 31:16.173
It's seldom the guys are forced
To put their,

31:16.175 --> 31:19.509
Butts on the line
To test a myth.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.812
That's a small one,
But it's a start.

31:21.814 --> 31:24.648
And now, after
Exhaustive preparations...

31:26.285 --> 31:27.384
That was better.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.186
They're ready to rumble.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.954
We're ready to find a location,

31:30.956 --> 31:34.091
Build a campsite
And test this myth.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.500
This sleeping bag
Is getting heavy.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.869
Almost there.

31:45.871 --> 31:48.405
We've just got to get to
The top of that mountain.

31:54.647 --> 31:56.947
Welcome to camp tootalotee.

31:56.949 --> 31:58.582
This is where
We're going to test the myth.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.751
Of the deadly dutch oven.

32:00.753 --> 32:02.452
We know what gas
We're going to use.

32:02.454 --> 32:03.921
We have a containment device.

32:03.923 --> 32:04.955
Now we just need to see.

32:04.957 --> 32:07.891
If buster
And his chainsmoking girlfriend.

32:07.893 --> 32:10.093
End up blowing the place up.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.863
That's right.
To properly test the myth,

32:12.865 --> 32:16.733
They've roped in buster
And his special someone.

32:16.735 --> 32:20.270
They start with
A cozy space blanket...

32:20.272 --> 32:21.271
It's done.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.673
Let's zip 'em up.

32:22.675 --> 32:25.342
And then
A sleeping bag made for two.

32:25.344 --> 32:26.910
Into the tent.

32:26.912 --> 32:28.078
Well, yeah. Okay.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.682
He kind of Looks smug about it.

32:31.684 --> 32:32.950
Not for long.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.554
According to the magazine
"Scientific american,".

32:37.556 --> 32:40.891
A good size fart is
About 1.3 fluid ounces of gas.

32:40.893 --> 32:43.393
With the space blanket liner
In that sleeping bag.

32:43.395 --> 32:44.761
And assuming
Our mythical camper's.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.463
Been tooting all night long,

32:46.465 --> 32:50.133
That sleeping bag's packing
About 13 fluid ounces of gas.

32:50.135 --> 32:53.603
Let's get This bag plugged up.

32:53.605 --> 32:56.206
Based on brian's
Explosive farts, the primary gas.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.775
We'll be using is hydrogen
Plus a little bit of oxygen.

32:58.777 --> 33:01.545
To simulate the natural
Composition of a fart.

33:01.547 --> 33:02.679
What do I think's
Going to happen?

33:02.681 --> 33:03.847
Well, we'll definitely
Get combustion,

33:03.849 --> 33:06.116
But will we get an explosion?

33:06.118 --> 33:07.551
That remains to be seen.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.419
All right. Let's tuck him in.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.521
Of all the things
That could go wrong.

33:11.523 --> 33:12.856
On a camping trip,

33:12.858 --> 33:15.092
This would seem to be
One of the least likely.

33:15.094 --> 33:17.461
All right.
We better get to the bunker.

33:17.463 --> 33:20.564
But could a dutch oven
Really be lethal?

33:20.566 --> 33:22.599
- You ready for this?
- Heck, yeah. Let's do this.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.836
All right. An entire night's
Worth of backfires loaded up.

33:25.838 --> 33:27.270
Igniters ready to go.

33:27.272 --> 33:29.539
Deadly dutch oven
Realistic fart test.

33:29.541 --> 33:30.507
Dude, this is nuts.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.876
All right. In three, two, one.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.051
We're getting close now. All right.
In three, two, one.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.586
We might have
A vertical water heater.

33:42.588 --> 33:43.787
Nope.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.722
Back on
The water heater rocket range,

33:45.724 --> 33:48.725
Things are definitely
Not going according to plan.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.694
Help me out, brian, With this.

33:50.696 --> 33:53.063
With the pressure
At 280 and climbing,

33:53.065 --> 33:54.731
Jon's simple trip rope.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.967
Has failed to bring
The water heater down.

33:56.969 --> 33:58.735
Can y'all help pull for jon?

33:58.737 --> 34:00.470
It could blow any second,

34:00.472 --> 34:02.639
So the entire crew
Leaps into action.

34:02.641 --> 34:05.208
What the? Pull, tommy.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.476
Okay.

34:09.581 --> 34:12.581
Finally, the rope trips the rig,

34:12.583 --> 34:15.452
But their problems aren't over.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.687
The pressure suddenly drops.

34:17.688 --> 34:19.121
Our pressure dropped.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.561
God.

34:25.864 --> 34:28.431
We're thinking at
This point, maybe, just maybe,

34:28.434 --> 34:30.266
There's some kind
Of rupture in the tank.

34:30.268 --> 34:32.702
A small rupture could
Spell disaster...

34:32.704 --> 34:34.704
299.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.039
But before long,

34:36.041 --> 34:39.009
The pressure is
Back on the rise.

34:39.011 --> 34:41.244
300 p.S.I.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.815
in less than a minute,
They're back on track.

34:44.817 --> 34:47.951
302.

34:47.953 --> 34:50.587
Temperature is 268 degrees
Fahrenheit.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.127
Holy crap.

35:00.799 --> 35:04.334
<i>That</i> was intense.

35:08.474 --> 35:09.539
One part of the prediction.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.541
Is resoundingly confirmed.

35:13.712 --> 35:16.580
The garage took
A cataclysmic hit.

35:16.582 --> 35:19.149
That just about
Knocked me on my ass.

35:19.151 --> 35:20.550
But what about the myth?

35:20.552 --> 35:25.455
Well, my question is is there
A hole through the r.V.?

35:25.457 --> 35:28.959
- Good blast radius.
- The door's already open.

35:28.961 --> 35:31.194
- Whoa!
- Ha!

35:31.196 --> 35:33.063
Look at that destruction.

35:33.065 --> 35:36.366
Sure enough, it's
A san andreassized shakeup,

35:36.368 --> 35:39.336
But there's one or two
Aftershocks to come.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.238
I mean, the bottom
Just blew off perfectly.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.439
Just<I> swoonk!</I>

35:43.775 --> 35:45.509
It went through
The wall at floor level.

35:45.511 --> 35:49.012
Just like in the myth,
But the r.V., while damaged,

35:49.014 --> 35:53.316
Isn't sporting the air vent
The myth called for.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.652
I mean, that's the start
Of a punched hole,

35:55.654 --> 35:57.387
But even where
It punched a hole,

35:57.389 --> 35:59.422
It doesn't look
Very round to me.

35:59.424 --> 36:00.824
Wow!

36:00.826 --> 36:03.527
It's like when you try to smash
A can on your head,

36:03.529 --> 36:06.029
But you don't quite succeed,
And it just goes thunk.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.698
How's buster doing?
He's just watching tv.

36:08.700 --> 36:11.034
He's fine.

36:11.036 --> 36:12.969
Fact is,
Their water heater torpedo.

36:12.971 --> 36:16.072
Ran smackdab
Into the r.V.'s chassis.

36:16.074 --> 36:19.876
That's where this myth
Hit a solid steel speed bump.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.745
The water heater shot
Through the wall,

36:21.747 --> 36:23.427
Which, if you remember,
We built to code...

36:25.017 --> 36:28.718
But then hit the chassis, which
Stopped it dead in its tracks.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.880
Buster didn't even notice.
Didn't even spill his drink.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.393
So... What do you say?

36:36.395 --> 36:38.795
Well, we got everything to
Happen as per the myth, right?

36:38.797 --> 36:41.031
The water heater fell over.
It failed catastrophically,

36:41.033 --> 36:43.133
And it slid all the way
Across the ground.

36:43.135 --> 36:45.435
Yeah, but with the garage
Perfectly level with the r.V.,

36:45.437 --> 36:46.903
That doesn't mean Busted for me.

36:46.905 --> 36:49.539
Yeah. If the mythical r.V.
Just sat a little bit lower.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.575
Or the water heater actually
Veered a little bit higher,

36:51.577 --> 36:54.844
We would have had a perfect hole
In one side and out the other.

36:54.846 --> 36:57.948
So I'd say it's plausible,
And you know what that means.

36:57.950 --> 37:00.383
Prime candidate for
Our firstever revisit?

37:00.385 --> 37:03.053
Yeah, but I think we're
Going to need a new r.V.

37:03.055 --> 37:04.654
Nah, That'll buff right out.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.856
- You think so?
- Yeah, I know a guy.

37:06.858 --> 37:10.160
All right. Let's,
Let's get outta here.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.773
Back at camp tootalotee,

37:23.775 --> 37:26.309
The guys are all set
To cut the cheese.

37:26.311 --> 37:28.311
Will adding a spark to a fart.

37:28.313 --> 37:30.947
Ruin the romance
And the campsite?

37:30.949 --> 37:33.183
Deadly dutch oven
Realistic fart test.

37:33.185 --> 37:36.086
Dude, this is nuts. All right.
In three...

37:36.088 --> 37:37.621
Two...

37:37.623 --> 37:38.623
One!

37:40.425 --> 37:42.859
And... Nothing just happened.

37:42.861 --> 37:45.929
- I mean, did the igniter work?
- Yeah, it worked.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.964
I guess that's kind of
What I expected.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.100
I thought there'd be, like,
A flame or a whoosh,

37:50.102 --> 37:52.836
But I guess we didn't have
Enough volume for an explosion.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.704
You know what that means,
Though, right?

37:54.706 --> 37:56.806
We go from full scale
To ridiculous scale?

37:56.808 --> 37:58.642
Yeah, that's exactly
The right answer.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.411
Never let it be said our boys.

38:01.413 --> 38:02.612
Don't do their homework.

38:04.650 --> 38:05.849
Back in the shop,

38:05.851 --> 38:07.984
They ran tests
With beanbag pellets...

38:07.986 --> 38:10.226
Make sure you're getting
All the nooks and crannies, jon.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.691
To find out
The exact cubic capacity.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.393
Of an occupied sleeping bag.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.795
It looks like
It's actually 10 cubic feet.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.797
That's perfect.

38:20.799 --> 38:21.998
That's the equivalent.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.834
Of almost a thousand
Booty bombs.

38:24.836 --> 38:28.138
There's still no guarantee
All that gas will go boom,

38:28.140 --> 38:31.308
But it's sure worth finding out.

38:31.310 --> 38:33.076
All right. We're set.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.544
So it's time to Fill the bags?

38:34.546 --> 38:36.413
- Yeah.
- So with these regulators,

38:36.415 --> 38:38.481
It's about 10 minutes
Of hydrogen.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.382
Correct.

38:39.384 --> 38:42.319
Go.

38:42.321 --> 38:44.654
Hopefully this wind
Doesn't pick up or else,

38:44.656 --> 38:47.223
You know,
Mess with our<I> explosion.</I>

38:47.225 --> 38:49.459
The wrong type of wind
For this myth.

38:51.930 --> 38:54.764
We're just seconds away from
Taking this myth over the top,

38:54.766 --> 38:58.001
And my prediction is destruction
On a massive scale.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.636
I'm talking about goodbye, tent,

38:59.638 --> 39:00.937
Goodbye, sleeping bag,

39:00.939 --> 39:04.207
And most likely, goodbye,
Buster's lady friend's hair.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.577
- All right, brian. You ready?
- Yeah.

39:07.579 --> 39:10.080
"What would it take?" test.

39:10.082 --> 39:12.949
In three...

39:12.951 --> 39:15.118
Two...

39:15.120 --> 39:16.453
One!

39:20.025 --> 39:21.591
That was a heck of a fart.

39:26.298 --> 39:27.530
It sure was...

39:28.900 --> 39:31.067
And another good reason
To give up smoking.

39:35.974 --> 39:37.540
Let's just assess.

39:37.542 --> 39:40.210
It ruined our tent
And the sleeping bag.

39:40.212 --> 39:42.178
I was kind of going,
Where did the fluff come from?

39:42.180 --> 39:45.014
I didn't realize until just now
It was the sleeping bag.

39:46.451 --> 39:49.018
- Did it just tear it open?
- It's all over there.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.620
This is fantastic.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.089
And I like this.

39:53.091 --> 39:55.792
We put the gas lines
By the exit,

39:55.794 --> 39:58.361
And that's where the burn was.

39:58.363 --> 40:00.730
This used to be hair but now
It's a helmet...

40:00.732 --> 40:02.899
A plastic helmet.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.134
No.

40:06.538 --> 40:07.971
If you look at it,
The only parts of him.

40:07.973 --> 40:10.774
That actually survived
Unscathed by this.

40:10.776 --> 40:13.710
Were his head and his arm
Holding down the blanket.

40:13.712 --> 40:15.445
Are you ready
For the high speed?

40:15.447 --> 40:17.013
I can't wait.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.323
That explosion expands
Fast enough.

40:27.325 --> 40:30.894
That it shreds The sleeping bag.

40:30.896 --> 40:34.864
It's fire and fluff And chaos.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.299
Wow, that's beautiful.

40:36.301 --> 40:37.400
In some weird way, That was one.

40:37.402 --> 40:39.068
Of the prettiest explosions
I've seen.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.474
And it was
A bona fide explosion.

40:47.112 --> 40:50.580
The high speed clearly shows
The destructive shockwave.

40:52.818 --> 40:55.785
That was A ruthless booty bomb.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.921
Blew the lid
Right off that dutch oven.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.324
That was pretty nuts.

41:01.326 --> 41:04.694
I mean, they sustained
Significantly more damage.

41:04.696 --> 41:07.597
Than I thought they would.
So what do you think?

41:07.599 --> 41:08.765
How do you want to call it?

41:08.767 --> 41:10.333
Well, it's really
A matter of volume.

41:10.335 --> 41:12.168
Considering no human
I know can backfire

41:12.170 --> 41:14.737
10 cubic feet of gas,
Let alone 1,

41:14.739 --> 41:16.506
I'm going to have
To say it's busted.

41:16.508 --> 41:18.775
But if you're a giant
With a stomach flu,

41:18.777 --> 41:20.610
Then you're going
To want to be careful.
