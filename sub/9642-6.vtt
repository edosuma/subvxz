WEBVTT

00:02.125 --> 00:03.708
Morning, sweetie.

00:03.708 --> 00:06.583
Are you ready to go to our
favorite breakfast place,

00:06.583 --> 00:08.416
Nuttin' But Flapjacks?

00:08.416 --> 00:11.458
It's the only good reason
to get up before noon, Daddy.

00:11.458 --> 00:13.625
Why do you guys
even like that place?

00:13.625 --> 00:15.583
It truly is
nothing but flapjacks.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.416
You have to bring your own
butter and syrup.

00:20.625 --> 00:24.333
Because it is our monthly
father/daughter tradition.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.416
And we use the leftover
pancakes to make masks,

00:26.416 --> 00:27.875
and scare people
on the subway.

00:27.875 --> 00:30.000
That's right. Arrgh!

00:30.000 --> 00:32.958
You guys are the
pancake-faced monsters?

00:33.875 --> 00:37.125
Hey guys, look
what Max is wearing.

00:37.125 --> 00:39.000
Take your jacket off
and show 'em.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.500
No, Mom.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.208
Come on.
Isn't it bad enough

00:42.208 --> 00:44.583
that I'm trapped inside
this little girl body

00:44.583 --> 00:46.708
that doesn't even
burp on command?

00:48.291 --> 00:51.416
Max, I'm sorry Justin
turned you into a little girl.

00:51.416 --> 00:53.250
You did this to me, too.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.083
And let me tell you,
it feels great

00:55.083 --> 00:56.958
not being the only one
in trouble for once.

00:58.458 --> 01:01.416
I dug out my favorite
Alex-little-girl clothes,

01:01.416 --> 01:03.083
and they fit perfectly.

01:03.083 --> 01:05.375
Oh, come on, show them!

01:09.708 --> 01:11.750
Ohh!

01:11.750 --> 01:14.250
I remember Alex
in this outfit.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.083
You're even cuter
than she was.

01:19.208 --> 01:20.750
I don't see it.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.458
Aww.

01:23.458 --> 01:27.583
You're so little, with
the ooh, and the... aww!

01:27.583 --> 01:31.458
She's just so huggable!

01:33.208 --> 01:35.000
Wow, they really
seem to miss

01:35.000 --> 01:37.125
having a little girl
in the house.

01:37.125 --> 01:39.291
I'm the little girl
in the house, OK?

01:39.291 --> 01:40.833
My dad and I
are about to go

01:40.833 --> 01:43.333
on our father/daughter
pancake breakfast.

01:43.333 --> 01:46.000
Ho! Look at the
pouty face.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.500
Mmm!

01:47.500 --> 01:49.875
Come on, Max, let's go
get some breakfast,

01:49.875 --> 01:53.333
and have a man to boy-
trapped-in-a-little-girl talk.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.291
Let's go.

01:55.291 --> 01:58.416
But, Dad, what about
our pancake breakfast?

01:58.416 --> 01:59.875
We'll do it next month.

02:03.166 --> 02:06.750
Alex, I think you're being
replaced as Daddy's little girl.

02:06.750 --> 02:10.750
Please.
I am Daddy's little girl.

02:10.750 --> 02:13.875
That is Daddy's little freak.

02:16.458 --> 02:22.875

03:07.458 --> 03:09.166
OK, Alex, check it out.

03:09.166 --> 03:12.583
I found one of my
old outfits for Max.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.125
Harper, what are you doing?

03:14.125 --> 03:15.708
He's cute enough already.

03:15.708 --> 03:18.000
Do you think that'll
fit me though?

03:19.333 --> 03:20.875
Well, look who
just made herself

03:20.875 --> 03:24.000
a peanut butter
and jealous sandwich.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.833
I'd be upset, but you know I
don't make my own sandwiches.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.583
Hey, Max, it's your turn
to clean the fryer. Get on it.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.583
- Fine.
- Oh.

03:34.583 --> 03:38.750
Alex, he's just
a little girl.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.875
You do it.

03:40.875 --> 03:45.000
Yeah, I'm a little girl.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.458
I can't clean a fryer.

03:47.458 --> 03:50.875
I probably can't do
a lot of things anymore.

03:50.875 --> 03:52.500
- Right, Daddy?
- Oh...

03:56.083 --> 03:58.583
He's doing to you exactly
what you used to do to me.

03:58.583 --> 04:00.375
Hmm, looks like
the little girl shoe

04:00.375 --> 04:04.583
is on the other foot,
and it fits well.

04:04.583 --> 04:06.583
All right, Harper.

04:06.583 --> 04:08.458
Let me go teach you
how to clean the fryer.

04:08.458 --> 04:09.583
Wait, why me?

04:09.583 --> 04:11.125
Because I'm too busy
being jealous.

04:13.458 --> 04:16.291
See, Max? It's not so bad
being a little girl.

04:16.291 --> 04:17.833
I got you out of
your chores.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.583
OK, what do you
want to do next?

04:19.583 --> 04:22.291
Well, I want to go
to my karate class,

04:22.291 --> 04:24.958
but I can't go down there
with these little hands.

04:24.958 --> 04:27.083
I mean, they look like
they belong on a squirrel.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.708
You can still go down.

04:29.708 --> 04:31.416
Just tell them you're
a new student.

04:31.416 --> 04:32.583
Justin'll take you.

04:32.583 --> 04:35.583
No, I can't, Dad.
That's a bad part of town.

04:35.583 --> 04:36.875
Not a good idea.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.750
Seriously, dude?

04:38.750 --> 04:41.291
Come on, I'll hold your hand
if it makes you feel better.

04:41.291 --> 04:43.583
Well, you don't need to
hold my hand, little miss,

04:43.583 --> 04:46.291
because I have a panic button
on my keychain.

04:47.833 --> 04:50.708
Hey Justin, what's up?

04:50.708 --> 04:52.708
Who's this
cute little girl?

04:52.708 --> 04:56.416
What cute little girl?
Oh, that cute little girl.

04:56.416 --> 04:59.000
Well, uh,
this is our cousin...

04:59.000 --> 05:01.583
From North Dakota.

05:01.583 --> 05:04.875
She lives with us now.

05:04.875 --> 05:07.458
Because her parents
went on a long trip...

05:07.458 --> 05:09.458
To South Dakota.

05:09.458 --> 05:12.125
OK, I just wanted
to know her name.

05:12.125 --> 05:14.000
- Max.
- ...ine.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Maxine is her name.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.500
Maxine?! Come on,
that's such a girly name.

05:19.500 --> 05:23.000
Yes, it is.
For a little girl.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.333
We gotta go.

05:25.333 --> 05:29.000
Maxine. That sounds
an awful lot like Max,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.208
which makes me wonder
why he's not here right now.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.708
Oh, for the love
of truth and justice,

05:32.708 --> 05:35.208
don't you and Harper have some
clogging shindig to go to?

05:35.208 --> 05:39.708
It's called the
Gaelic Clog Dancing Exhibit
and Luncheon.

05:39.708 --> 05:41.500
D'uh!

05:41.500 --> 05:44.500
Oh, my gosh,
I was right?

05:44.500 --> 05:46.875
And I don't want to miss
a minute of it. Come on.

05:46.875 --> 05:48.625
Uh, Harper,

05:48.625 --> 05:51.375
you have to make sure
that Zeke stays away from here

05:51.375 --> 05:54.708
until we figure out how to
turn Maxine back into Max.

05:54.708 --> 05:56.708
OK, but it's not
gonna be easy.

05:56.708 --> 05:59.375
He really loves
hanging out here.
Watch.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.000
Hey, what's taking so long?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.166
The sooner we leave,
the sooner we can

06:02.166 --> 06:03.750
come back here
and hang out!

06:21.333 --> 06:24.958
- Hello, meditating man.
- Shh!

06:24.958 --> 06:26.625
This is Maxine.

06:26.625 --> 06:28.708
Shh!

06:28.708 --> 06:31.083
She'd like to sign up
for one of your classes.

06:31.083 --> 06:34.458
In my dojo, we do not
sign up for class,

06:34.458 --> 06:38.000
we become... the class.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.208
Class?
There is no one here.

06:43.208 --> 06:47.416
Regardless, can Maxine
become the class?

06:47.416 --> 06:50.000
Of course.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.583
After she proves she is worthy.

06:51.583 --> 06:55.000
- Please take off your...
- shoes.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.750
It's a dojo, dude.

07:00.291 --> 07:02.083
Don't call me "dude."

07:02.083 --> 07:06.416
Whoo! You still
have Max's feet.

07:06.416 --> 07:09.000
Thanks for noticing
my foot stink.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.625
I call it "fink."

07:10.625 --> 07:13.166
My hours of meditation

07:13.166 --> 07:17.125
prevent me from smelling
that... fink.

07:20.833 --> 07:23.250
Now, remember, Maxine,

07:23.250 --> 07:26.333
karate is not a way to fight,

07:26.333 --> 07:29.458
but a means to find
inner peace, as I have.

07:29.458 --> 07:32.333
Please demonstrate
where karate is in you.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.833
Would you mind helping?

07:36.625 --> 07:39.125
I, uh, I don't fight girls.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.291
It's not
something that I do.

07:41.291 --> 07:43.000
If you and I
were to throw down...

07:43.000 --> 07:44.375
I know you got
a black belt...

07:44.375 --> 07:46.458
Whoa! Hey!

07:47.708 --> 07:51.416
Yes! A little girl kicking butt?

07:51.416 --> 07:54.291
Gotta love that!

07:54.291 --> 07:56.000
Let's see what else you got.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.833
Where is your
inner peace, meditation man?!

08:01.458 --> 08:04.458
And I call this last move,

08:04.458 --> 08:07.625
"payback for
naming me Maxine."

08:13.000 --> 08:15.458
Yes!

08:15.458 --> 08:19.958
I don't know what's worse.
The fink or the pain.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.333
Thanks for taking me to
the clogging festival, Zeke.

08:31.333 --> 08:32.333
No problem.

08:32.333 --> 08:35.333
Sorry you took
that clog to the nog.

08:35.333 --> 08:37.375
That's why they have that
yellow line around the dancers.

08:37.375 --> 08:39.208
You shouldn't have
stepped on it.

08:39.208 --> 08:40.458
No, wait! Stop!

08:40.458 --> 08:42.458
Yeah, you can't go in there.

08:42.458 --> 08:45.000
Why not? We always hang out
at the sub shop.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.708
Well, maybe we should
try something new,

08:46.708 --> 08:49.583
like hanging out
at the produce stand.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.083
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

08:51.083 --> 08:53.458
Mr. Chung doesn't like it
when I buy one grape at a time.

08:53.458 --> 08:56.458
And why
should I overeat?

08:56.458 --> 08:58.333
Wait, stop!

08:58.333 --> 08:59.458
It's closed.

09:03.208 --> 09:06.125
Now it's closed.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.750
No, no, no! Stop!
You really can't go in there.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.125
Why not?

09:12.125 --> 09:14.250
Because...
Because, um...

09:14.250 --> 09:16.250
Mr. and Mrs. Russo hate you!

09:17.375 --> 09:20.833
What?
They hate me?

09:20.833 --> 09:23.250
Are you sure?

09:23.250 --> 09:25.583
Aw, of course,
you're sure!

09:25.583 --> 09:28.125
Why would you say it
if it wasn't true?

09:29.583 --> 09:31.708
Wait, Zeke!
Come back!

09:31.708 --> 09:34.583
It's family church camp
all over again!

09:47.750 --> 09:50.625
Alex, is that shirt

09:50.625 --> 09:53.333
the lady bug skirt
you wore to kindergarten?

09:53.333 --> 09:56.500
Oh, is it? Huh!

09:56.500 --> 09:58.875
I just found it in my closet
and casually threw it on.

09:58.875 --> 10:02.458
Mija,I know
a lot of women

10:02.458 --> 10:04.166
that dress too young
for their age,

10:04.166 --> 10:05.750
and it's... it's gross.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.458
Wait a second.

10:09.458 --> 10:12.416
You're making your father's
favorite sandwich, huh?

10:12.416 --> 10:15.250
And wearing clothes
from when you were little.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.833
Are you trying to
get his attention?

10:17.833 --> 10:19.250
No.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.291
And I'd prove it,
except I'm in a hurry.

10:21.291 --> 10:23.333
Dad's not gonna love me more
if his sandwich is cold.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.333
Hey, Daddy.
I made you a sandwich.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.875
And, I put six meatballs
in there.

10:29.875 --> 10:32.833
Ohh! I'm impressed.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.250
Mmm!

10:36.250 --> 10:38.708
That is delicious!

10:38.708 --> 10:40.958
- Thank you, sweetie.
- Mm-hmm.

10:45.208 --> 10:47.833
Guess what happened
at karate today, Dad.

10:47.833 --> 10:51.083
I used my stinky feet to
rearrange Justin's face.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.958
Smell his face.

10:52.958 --> 10:57.000
Oh, there's nothing cuter than
a little girl kicking butt.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.750
That's what the sensei said.
What is so cute about that?

11:01.958 --> 11:05.583
I can't help it if people
think I'm cute.

11:05.583 --> 11:08.708
Watch how I
make it work for me.

11:08.708 --> 11:11.958
- So...
- Oh, thank you.

11:11.958 --> 11:16.166
Daddy, do you want to take
me out for some ice cream?

11:16.166 --> 11:17.875
Sure, I'm not
doing anything.

11:17.875 --> 11:19.750
But, Daddy,
you didn't finish

11:19.750 --> 11:22.000
this very delicious sandwich
I made you.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.583
I've lost my appetite.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.583
It kind of smells like
Justin's face in here.

11:27.583 --> 11:30.583
Come on, sweetie.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.750
All right, that's it.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.333
Max is replacing me
as Daddy's little girl,

11:35.333 --> 11:36.875
and I'm not gonna let him
get away with it.

11:36.875 --> 11:38.583
Dad didn't even care
that that little girl

11:38.583 --> 11:42.375
showed me parts of my body
I can only see with a mirror.

11:46.166 --> 11:49.833
So... may I take your order?

11:49.833 --> 11:52.291
Is Mom wearing one of
your skirts as a shirt?

11:52.291 --> 11:56.875
Yeah, I don't know where
she got that idea from.

12:02.166 --> 12:03.166
Zeke?

12:04.416 --> 12:06.458
What are you doing here?

12:06.458 --> 12:08.375
Oh, just making breakfast
for the Russos

12:08.375 --> 12:10.333
to get them to stop
hating me.

12:11.875 --> 12:16.458
Oh, good morning,
Mr. and Mrs. Russo!

12:16.458 --> 12:17.708
Some breakfast?

12:17.708 --> 12:20.750
- Yes, enjoy.
- Oh, um...

12:20.750 --> 12:23.875
Thanks, Zeke.
It's, uh, a surprise.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.708
Oh, look at that.

12:25.708 --> 12:28.416
There's ketchup with
my potatoes. Fancy.

12:28.416 --> 12:31.291
Oh, no, the ketchup's
mixed in with the eggs!

12:31.291 --> 12:33.708
I am a failure!

12:33.708 --> 12:36.166
Zeke, are you all right?

12:36.166 --> 12:38.458
Of course I'm not all right!
You guys hate me.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.875
Harper told me everything.

12:41.583 --> 12:45.958
Harper, can we talk
over here, please?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.958
What is Zeke doing here?

12:49.958 --> 12:51.958
You were supposed to
keep him away from Maxine.

12:51.958 --> 12:54.125
I tried, but he
wouldn't give up.

12:54.125 --> 12:57.583
And I kind of panicked and
told him that you guys hate him.

12:58.875 --> 13:01.583
Zeke...

13:01.583 --> 13:03.583
...listen.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.458
There's been
a misunderstanding.

13:05.458 --> 13:07.166
Huh.

13:07.166 --> 13:11.125
We do not hate you.

13:11.125 --> 13:14.333
Of course, you hate me.
And I figured out why.

13:14.333 --> 13:17.000
I'm a taker. I just come in
and take, take, take.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.375
I need to be a giver.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.583
Which is why
I made you breakfast...

13:20.583 --> 13:23.000
...from food that
I took from you.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Dang it, aw!

13:25.000 --> 13:26.833
Now, I hate me.

13:26.833 --> 13:29.250
That's it.
I'm not gonna leave here

13:29.250 --> 13:31.250
until I get you all
to like me.

13:35.125 --> 13:38.125
Oh. What's up, Zekester?

13:38.125 --> 13:41.458
Max used to call me that.
Where is Max anyway?

13:41.458 --> 13:46.208
We've got to get Maxine
to karate practice.

13:46.208 --> 13:47.833
Oh, ho, ho.
I get it.

13:47.833 --> 13:50.208
The old
"karate practice" excuse.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.625
Come on, Harper,
come with us.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.333
Who knows what
you'll tell Zeke next?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.708
But I'm still in my pajamas.
Oh! What am I saying?

13:56.708 --> 13:59.000
I wore a rack of lamb hat
the other day.

14:00.375 --> 14:01.833
Aw, this is worse
than I thought!

14:01.833 --> 14:05.000
I'm driving you away
from your own home!

14:05.000 --> 14:07.375
Oh, man!

14:09.291 --> 14:12.291
Alex, there's nothing in
these books to change Max back.

14:14.333 --> 14:17.875
- What are you doing?
- This fly is driving me crazy.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.708
Just use the flyswatter spell.

14:19.708 --> 14:21.833
What?! There is
a spell for that?

14:21.833 --> 14:23.708
There's a spell for everything
except how to change

14:23.708 --> 14:25.500
our little brother
back into himself.

14:28.875 --> 14:30.000
Fly swat now rot.

14:32.416 --> 14:34.875
That was awesome!

14:34.875 --> 14:37.166
Ew,
there's fly guts.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.708
Get it off me.

14:38.708 --> 14:40.583
I don't know what to do, Alex.

14:40.583 --> 14:42.166
There's nothing in
any of these books

14:42.166 --> 14:44.500
that says anything about
reversing what we did to Max.

14:44.500 --> 14:48.625
Reverse? Well, then,
that's what we should do.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.333
Do the spells,
but in reverse.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.833
I'll do the spell you did,
and you do the spell I did.

14:52.833 --> 14:55.333
No, I don't know.
Colliding spells
can be unpredictable.

14:55.333 --> 14:58.208
He could end up as
something gross, like a...

14:58.208 --> 14:59.333
...ogre.

15:01.416 --> 15:02.500
I'm cool with that.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.416
I am too, let's do it.

15:09.958 --> 15:11.875
- Zeke!
- Hey, guys!

15:11.875 --> 15:14.708
Just helping your parents out
with the laundry.

15:14.708 --> 15:17.458
Hey Justin, these Captain
Jim Bob Sherwood boxers

15:17.458 --> 15:19.416
look like they've seen
their last mission.

15:19.416 --> 15:22.833
I have been
looking for those!

15:28.000 --> 15:29.625
Alex...

15:29.625 --> 15:31.416
If Zeke is here
when Maxine gets home,

15:31.416 --> 15:33.083
we won't be able to
cast the spell on her.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.333
Are you guys
whispering about me?

15:35.333 --> 15:38.083
No, no.

15:38.083 --> 15:41.416
Oh, I get it. You guys
don't want me here, either.

15:41.416 --> 15:42.708
You hate me, too!

15:42.708 --> 15:44.875
I don't hate you.
We're buddies.

15:44.875 --> 15:46.750
Oh, buddies?

15:46.750 --> 15:49.458
I thought
we were best friends.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.125
Now we're downgraded
to buddies?

15:51.125 --> 15:53.291
That's it.

15:53.291 --> 15:56.125
I'm not leaving here until
I get you all to like me.

15:58.458 --> 16:02.958
Well, I'm not gonna like you
until you leave.

16:05.416 --> 16:07.958
I'm at a crossroads here.

16:07.958 --> 16:09.500
Wait, I know!

16:09.500 --> 16:11.833
I'll win you guys over
with a song from my heart.

16:11.833 --> 16:14.000
That's really not necessary.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.583
♪ We were the best of friends
you and I ♪

16:17.583 --> 16:19.083
♪ Yeah, yeah ♪

16:19.083 --> 16:21.458
♪ You miss me
I love you so much ♪

16:21.458 --> 16:23.083
New plan.
We go to the dojo

16:23.083 --> 16:24.708
and cast the spell
on Maxine there.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.291
♪ Why don't you
Why don't you ♪

16:26.291 --> 16:27.750
♪ Love me anymore? ♪♪

16:27.750 --> 16:29.375
Go, go!

16:34.291 --> 16:38.625
Ho, ho, ho! Great
technique, Maxine. Good job.

16:38.625 --> 16:41.125
OK, who's next?

16:41.125 --> 16:42.375
Hmm?

16:43.375 --> 16:44.500
You.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.875
Oh, see, I'm not
in the class.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.083
These are just pajamas.

16:50.083 --> 16:54.500
That look an awful lot
like a karate uniform.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.000
You are the chosen one.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.125
OK, just so we're clear,

17:02.125 --> 17:03.375
the only reason
I'm putting this on

17:03.375 --> 17:05.833
is 'cause it
matches my outfit, so...

17:05.833 --> 17:07.458
Begin your journey.

17:07.458 --> 17:09.458
No, no, wait!

17:15.333 --> 17:17.416
Yeah!

17:17.416 --> 17:18.958
That's Daddy's little girl!

17:20.333 --> 17:24.458
I hope the sensei doesn't
mistake me for a young student.

17:24.458 --> 17:25.875
Yeah.

17:27.583 --> 17:29.583
There she is.

17:29.583 --> 17:31.708
Shoes!

17:31.708 --> 17:33.875
Actually, it's a sandal that
could be mistaken as a heel.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.500
Come on!

17:38.083 --> 17:40.208
What are you guys
doing here?

17:40.208 --> 17:43.000
We rushed over here
because we think we have
a way to change you back.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.750
Really? OK, let's do it.

17:45.750 --> 17:48.750
'Cause Mom wants me to get
my ears pierced later,

17:48.750 --> 17:52.750
and I'm starting
to like the idea.

17:52.750 --> 17:55.000
Hippety hop,
let go of my top.

17:58.458 --> 18:02.000
- No, this can't be.
- We made it worse.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.000
Pigtails?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.291
Lollipop!

18:08.291 --> 18:11.833
You didn't change
me back, you made me cuter.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.125
Get ready.

18:15.125 --> 18:18.875
Because "Maxine" is gonna be
your cutest nightmare.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.416
Ever.

18:23.583 --> 18:26.250
Hi, Mommy! Hi, Daddy!

18:29.250 --> 18:31.458
There she is.

18:31.458 --> 18:34.333
Our little girl gets
cuter by the minute!

18:34.333 --> 18:36.291
The pigtails are
adorable, honey!

18:38.458 --> 18:42.166
Our next match is
Maxine versus Lilly Bell.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.833
Oh, no. I'd rather
tangle it up

18:44.833 --> 18:46.208
with one of those guys.

18:48.833 --> 18:51.625
I don't even have...
I don't fight girls.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.208
You do now.

18:59.708 --> 19:04.583
I got a butt concussion!

19:06.208 --> 19:08.416
Someone should
squash her like a bug.

19:08.416 --> 19:09.958
A fly is a bug, right?

19:09.958 --> 19:11.458
- Yeah.
- Got it.

19:11.458 --> 19:12.458
Fly swat now rot.

19:19.875 --> 19:22.833
Swat! Swat! Swat! Swat!

19:24.375 --> 19:25.708
Swat! Swat! Swat! Swat!

19:44.708 --> 19:46.000
Yes!

19:46.000 --> 19:48.875
Yes!
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:48.875 --> 19:53.291
that's a little something
I like to call ka-ra-tay.

19:56.250 --> 19:58.208
How can you do that
to a little girl?

19:58.208 --> 20:00.208
She is not a little girl!

20:01.375 --> 20:04.208
I know she looks like
a little girl, OK,

20:04.208 --> 20:05.875
but she's not. Nope.

20:05.875 --> 20:06.875
And...
And there are...

20:06.875 --> 20:08.625
Whoo, you are upset.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.708
Shoes on the mat!

20:12.708 --> 20:16.708
Maxine, honey?
Are you OK?

20:16.708 --> 20:18.416
She's still a little groggy.

20:18.416 --> 20:20.625
Wait, hand me
one of her shoes.

20:23.833 --> 20:25.166
I'm good!

20:25.166 --> 20:28.875
All right. She's OK,
everybody. She's OK!

20:32.708 --> 20:34.333
I'm glad your little girl's OK.

20:47.583 --> 20:49.875
Hey, Alex, can we talk?

20:49.875 --> 20:53.291
Why? Maxine in bed already?

20:53.291 --> 20:55.125
OK, look.

20:55.125 --> 20:58.250
I'm sorry for getting
so caught up with Maxine.

20:58.250 --> 21:03.708
It's just because
she reminded me of you.

21:06.958 --> 21:08.833
I'm sorry I got jealous.

21:08.833 --> 21:11.875
It's just seeing Max
as a little girl

21:11.875 --> 21:14.833
makes me realize
that I'm not anymore.

21:14.833 --> 21:19.833
Hey, you're always gonna be
my little girl, sweetie.

21:19.833 --> 21:22.583
Thanks, Daddy.

21:22.583 --> 21:25.000
Look what I got.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.125
Pancakes!

21:27.125 --> 21:29.625
That's awesome!

21:29.625 --> 21:32.458
Hey, guys,
what's going on up here?

21:32.458 --> 21:34.291
We're pancake-faced monsters!

21:34.291 --> 21:36.166
We want syrup!

21:43.083 --> 21:44.500
Zeke, the Russos told me

21:44.500 --> 21:46.958
they have something
they want to tell you.

21:46.958 --> 21:50.333
Zeke, we did hate you.

21:50.333 --> 21:52.333
I knew it.
Why are you doing this?

21:52.333 --> 21:55.375
But you won us back.

21:55.375 --> 21:58.125
You're back in,
best friend.

21:58.125 --> 22:01.125
Oh, man, yes!
I knew I could do it!

22:01.125 --> 22:03.500
You know what
won us over?

22:03.500 --> 22:04.875
Your song.

22:04.875 --> 22:09.000
You should sing it
for Maxine.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.875
No, I don't think so.

22:10.875 --> 22:13.958
Well, think again.
It goes like this.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.875
-♪ You liked me ♪
- Stop.

22:15.875 --> 22:18.000
-♪ I liked you ♪
- Oh, my God. Stop! Stop!

22:18.000 --> 22:19.833
♪ We were the best of friends ♪

22:19.833 --> 22:21.958
♪ Best of friends ♪

22:21.958 --> 22:23.708
♪ Best of friends
You and I ♪

22:23.708 --> 22:26.833
♪ You and I
Everybody together ♪♪
