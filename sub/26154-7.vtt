00:09.009 --> 00:11.302
-[watch ticking]
-[woman humming]

00:12.387 --> 00:14.931
-I know, I know.
-I'm just glad you showed up.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.850
The waitstaff was starting
to get suspicious.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.060
See? I'm not a liar! I do have a wife!

00:19.144 --> 00:22.772
-All right. You're trying to embarrass me.
-And I did. And now I'm fine.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.858
-Hi, you.
-Hi, you. [kisses]

00:24.941 --> 00:26.234
Long day at the office?

00:26.317 --> 00:27.986
-I lost them, Indira.
-No.

00:28.069 --> 00:30.196
In all my years of corporate mediation,

00:30.280 --> 00:33.700
I've never been unable to resolve
a dispute before it goes to arbitration.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.994
I'm Mary-Beth, the Mediating Maven.

00:36.077 --> 00:38.538
I'm sure you helped them
in ways you'll never even know.

00:38.621 --> 00:42.417
-I-- Don't therapize me.
-[chuckles] But you're so easy!

00:42.625 --> 00:44.377
You make me feel like
I'm actually good at it.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.545
What's going on with you?

00:45.628 --> 00:47.172
-It's been a tough week.
-Tell me.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.089
Mm...

00:48.173 --> 00:50.759
-I shouldn't talk about my clients.
-Come on.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.887
What if you changed all the names
and identifying characteristics?

00:54.304 --> 00:57.140
Okay. This is a story about...

00:57.432 --> 01:02.854
Bo... Bo... BoBo, the Angsty Zebra.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.939
[theme music playing]

01:57.700 --> 01:59.661
-[writing]
-[Indira]  So, it all started on Monday.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.496
I was in a session with Diane--

02:01.579 --> 02:02.789
...a! Diana.

02:02.872 --> 02:04.833
[Mary-Beth]  Like Diana,
Princess of Whales?

02:04.916 --> 02:06.000
[Indira]  Exactly.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.044
It's just so tough
being Princess of Whales.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.088
Like, I can't be all things to all whales.

02:10.171 --> 02:11.339
-You're deflecting.
-I'm not!

02:11.422 --> 02:13.007
Let's talk about the BoBo tape.

02:13.341 --> 02:14.259
What's the BoBo tape?

02:14.342 --> 02:16.928
She recently came into possession
of an audiotape

02:17.011 --> 02:20.181
of her friend and co-worker,
BoBo, the Angsty Zebra.

02:20.557 --> 02:24.561
[BoBo]  On the boat. There was a girl.
In New Mexico.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.857
And she trusted me. Also, I'm a zebra.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.317
-What girl is he talking about?
-I don't know.

02:31.401 --> 02:35.697
"Girl" sounds young, right? [scoffs]
Whatever it is, it's gotta be bad,

02:35.780 --> 02:38.449
because, otherwise,
why wouldn't he tell me?

02:38.533 --> 02:41.077
Diana, you are not responsible
for the dysfunction of others.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.996
I actually explore this in my book,

02:43.079 --> 02:45.123
Are You Responsible
For The Dysfunction of Others?

02:45.206 --> 02:46.749
Spoiler alert: You're not!

02:46.833 --> 02:50.211
I just wish I could talk to him about it,
but he's like an open sore.

02:50.378 --> 02:54.048
Attention! As some of you
might have heard, my mom died recently.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.300
I know you're very concerned,

02:55.383 --> 02:57.468
but I wanna let you know
it will not affect my work.

02:57.552 --> 03:01.222
I'm here, and I'm doing fine.
I just want to focus on the show.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.225
So, please treat this like any other day,
and be extra-nice to me

03:04.309 --> 03:07.478
because I am a famous actor,
not because my mom died.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.023
[all murmuring]

03:10.106 --> 03:11.232
Thank you. Good.

03:11.316 --> 03:14.861
Yes, that's what I'm looking for.
Just go about your business.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.030
That's good 'cause I don't want to talk
about my mom.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.073
Hmm. [grunts]

03:19.157 --> 03:22.952
-Hey. Did you hear my mom died?
-Yeah. But you don't wanna talk about it.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.079
No. Pretty weird she died, though, huh?

03:25.163 --> 03:28.583
-Do you want to talk about it?
-No. I'm just saying it's weird.

03:28.666 --> 03:32.170
-BoBo. I am so sorry.
-And I so don't wanna talk about it.

03:32.253 --> 03:35.298
Obsessed with my mom much?
You're the one with issues.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.507
Uh...

03:36.674 --> 03:39.510
I feel like he wants me to comfort him,
but I'm still angry.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.971
Maybe you could both use some space
from each other.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.349
Why don't you tell him you need
to focus on your work?

03:44.432 --> 03:46.559
What work?
Flippy won't let me do anything.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.770
[dolphin voice]

03:49.103 --> 03:51.397
Flippy? Are you okay?

03:51.481 --> 03:52.899
[squeaking]

03:57.987 --> 04:00.990
Hey, what are we filming today?
Why is there a submarine set?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.909
[squeaking continues]

04:02.992 --> 04:04.827
[Diana] Interior sub?

04:07.372 --> 04:08.706
Why didn't you just write "way"?

04:11.292 --> 04:15.213
Okay. So, now we just need
to come up with a scene

04:15.296 --> 04:16.798
that takes place in a submarine.

04:22.595 --> 04:23.596
Okay.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.600
-Ah!
-Did you hear my mom died?

04:28.059 --> 04:29.936
[Indira] How about this?
If he wants to talk,

04:30.019 --> 04:31.354
and you aren't can't confront him,

04:31.437 --> 04:33.773
tell him your  therapist  says
you need space.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.652
That's where I went wrong.
I inserted myself into her story.

04:37.735 --> 04:40.822
Don't beat yourself up.
Remember what Doctor Janet said?

04:41.030 --> 04:43.032
[bells in accordance to stick]

04:44.325 --> 04:47.328
Tell me about your day.
You had a tough workplace mediation?

04:47.412 --> 04:51.291
Whoo! The problem with these two
is they don't just work together.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.042
They also live together.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.920
[grunting]

04:56.004 --> 04:57.297
What a beautiful morning!

04:57.380 --> 04:58.798
[Indira] Wait, wait,, wait. Hold on.

04:59.048 --> 05:03.511
If your story can have Princess Diana,
why can't mine have Emperor Finger-Face?

05:03.594 --> 05:06.889
It's not actually Princess Diana.
She's just named Diana.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.599
I've been picturing Princess Diana.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.936
Okay, fine. Tell me what happened
with Emperor Finger-Face.

05:12.020 --> 05:17.108
He lived in the same apartment
as a Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning

05:17.191 --> 05:18.609
in the shape of a woman.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.278
Good morning, Emperor Finger-Face!

05:20.361 --> 05:24.073
Good morning to you,
Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning!

05:24.157 --> 05:25.742
-See you tonight?
-Afternoon.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.578
I wanna talk to you,
so I set a meeting through your assistant.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.164
-Have you seen my keys?
-Butter tray in the fridge.

05:31.247 --> 05:34.083
I think I put them there
during one of my night terrors.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.128
I don't have time to go to the kitchen.
I'll just hotwire my car.

05:37.211 --> 05:40.590
-Hey, did you eat breakfast?
-No time for meals.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.800
I just grab whatever I can,
whenever I can.

05:42.884 --> 05:43.801
Hold on.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.219
I know you're a gal on the go,

05:45.303 --> 05:48.556
but even tangled fogs of pulsating
yearning need to eat right.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.058
I'll get something on set.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.810
Pinky swear? [horn] Ow! I poked my face!

05:53.102 --> 05:55.104
I feel I'm having a hard time
following the story

05:55.188 --> 05:57.065
because of how weird
you made the characters.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.901
The important thing is that these two
have been living together

05:59.984 --> 06:02.403
for almost a year with virtually no drama.

06:02.487 --> 06:05.948
In some ways, it's the most functional
relationship either have ever been in!

06:06.032 --> 06:08.201
Oh, okay. I guess that's not that weird.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.912
Great! Now, back to the story
of the fog and the hand!

06:11.329 --> 06:14.665
-So. What can I do you for?
-I have no workspace on set.

06:14.749 --> 06:18.836
I was hoping we could allocate some money
to get me an office.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.548
Oh, look, here's the exact paperwork
you need all filled out and ready to go.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.092
-Okay.
-Just needs your signature.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.636
-Let me retrieve my pen.
-Marvelous!

06:26.719 --> 06:30.431
Yep, I am currently gripping my pen
inside my jacket.

06:30.515 --> 06:34.310
Now to just pull it out
and sign this document.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.395
Just goes to show,

06:35.478 --> 06:37.772
you get what you need
if you pull the right strings.

06:38.022 --> 06:38.981
Strings?

06:39.232 --> 06:41.692
-[gasps] It was you!
-What was me?

06:41.776 --> 06:46.197
The last string cheese in the apartment,
I was saving it. And you took it!

06:46.280 --> 06:48.825
And now you want me to give you an office?

06:48.908 --> 06:50.785
What?! I didn't take your cheese.

06:50.868 --> 06:54.497
Uh-oh, are we having
a work-related conflict?

06:54.580 --> 06:58.793
This feels like more of a
you-crashing-on-my-couch-related conflict.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.212
When I started here,
I signed a contract that said,

07:01.295 --> 07:05.258
all intra-office disputes
must be resolved via mediation,

07:05.341 --> 07:08.678
or failing that, forced arbitration.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.263
Ugh!

07:10.680 --> 07:12.557
So, then I-- You're not eating.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.601
I just-- I keep thinking
about BoBo the Zebra.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.187
Okay, what happened next with BoBo?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.689
Well, he wanted to get back to work,

07:19.772 --> 07:23.109
but since Flippy had writer's block,
there was nothing for the actors to do.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.902
How is there nothing to shoot?

07:24.986 --> 07:28.156
So, what, I just have to wait around,
and be alone with my thoughts? Gross.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.908
When I was on  The Murder-Stoppers.
we had to shut down production

07:30.992 --> 07:33.161
because Nick Nolte wouldn't come out
of his trailer.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.455
He wasn't even on the show!
He was in one of our trailers,

07:35.538 --> 07:38.124
-and we couldn't get him out!
-Is it hard to write a script, Gino?

07:38.207 --> 07:40.460
"Oh, I'm Philbert, bang, bang.
I'm a tough guy.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.212
My wife is dead! Did I kill her?
Who knows? I'm cool."

07:43.296 --> 07:45.214
That was pretty good.
Can we just roll on that?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.049
When there's something to shoot,
we'll shoot.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.219
Meanwhile, you wanna go bang one out
in your trailer? I'll get my diaphragm.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.638
Nah, I'd just be thinking about
my dead mom the whole time,

07:52.722 --> 07:54.056
which would either ruin it or--

07:54.140 --> 07:56.642
Oh, God, what if it makes it better?
I don't wanna know that.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.769
-You want me to just get you some pie?
-No.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.063
-Yes.
-Okay, big guy.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.148
[BoBo sighs]

08:02.231 --> 08:05.526
-[sympathetic voice] Hey, buddy.
-Hey, Mr. Chocolate-Hazelnut-Spread.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.195
Really sorry about your mom.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.405
No, it's fine. I'm fine. It's really fine.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.992
It must be so hard to lose a loved one.
I, for one, never have.

08:13.075 --> 08:14.494
You've never lost a loved one?

08:14.577 --> 08:17.205
-When my mom got old, she moved to a farm.
-What?

08:17.288 --> 08:19.832
In the country, where she could have
plenty of room to run free.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.751
Why would she wanna run around
if she's old?

08:21.834 --> 08:23.794
You know,
I never really questioned the logic.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.214
My brother set it up.
I haven't been able to visit,

08:26.297 --> 08:28.633
but everyone in my family
goes to that farm eventually.

08:28.716 --> 08:32.094
-Oh, dude, your mom's dead.
-What? No. She's at a farm.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.597
After a prolonged bout of Parkinson's.
A farm.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.475
Where they don't have telephones,
or the internet, and... Oh, my God.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.810
She's dead. My mom is dead!

08:39.894 --> 08:41.270
-[sobbing]
-Whoa!

08:41.354 --> 08:42.438
[BoBo groans]

08:42.522 --> 08:43.689
Oh, there... There, there.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.857
[Flippy squeaking]

08:44.982 --> 08:47.527
-What's going on with this submarine?
-My therapist doesn't want me

08:47.610 --> 08:48.528
talking to you!

08:48.611 --> 08:51.197
-What?
-My therapist, Dr. Indira,

08:51.280 --> 08:53.783
says it would be good
if you gave me some space.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.160
-Why would she say that?
-Don't know. I'm just the client.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.621
-Her call, not mine. I should go.
-Uh...

08:58.704 --> 09:02.124
Everybody? My dear mother
has transcended this plane.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.876
-[all] Aw.
-I am incredibly fragile

09:03.960 --> 09:05.920
and could use all the support I can get,

09:06.003 --> 09:08.256
so if everyone could pay
a lot of attention to me,

09:08.339 --> 09:10.424
and ask me a lot of questions
about my mother,

09:10.508 --> 09:12.260
and maybe tell me stories
about your mothers,

09:12.343 --> 09:14.470
I think that would really make me
feel a lot better.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.055
Sure, Mr. Chocolate-Hazelnut-Spread!

09:16.138 --> 09:19.100
-[man] So sorry for your loss.
-This is a very healthy way to grieve.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.017
-[applause]
-Ugh.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.438
So, a brief recapitulation:

09:24.522 --> 09:27.692
this is not a room
for repudiation or condemnation

09:27.775 --> 09:30.528
over string cheese
appropriation accusations.

09:30.611 --> 09:34.323
Mediation is an invitation
for open conversation,

09:34.407 --> 09:37.827
frustration de-escalation,
and exchange of information,

09:37.910 --> 09:39.287
which, in summation,

09:39.370 --> 09:43.374
removes any justification for litigation
involving this corporation.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.585
Nobody was going to litigate anything.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.462
That's fabulous,
because you legally cannot.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.674
Now, tell me about your journey
into the woods of conflict.

09:51.757 --> 09:55.219
Well, this very Wednesday, October 24th,

09:55.303 --> 09:59.807
I was excited to come home
to some string cheese. The very last one.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.726
I'd been saving it all week.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.145
-All week until Wednesday?
-That is correct.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.564
I measure my weeks Thursday to Wednesday.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.899
-Why would you--
-Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning?

10:08.983 --> 10:10.818
Emperor Finger-Face has the floor.

10:10.901 --> 10:11.986
I was gonna melt it down

10:12.069 --> 10:14.697
and then sculpt it
into a Mozzarella Cinderella!

10:14.780 --> 10:18.034
But when I got home,
my string cheese was gone!

10:18.117 --> 10:19.327
Doesn't mean I took it.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.621
Tangled Fog, watch yourself.
Or I'll turn on this fan.

10:21.829 --> 10:25.583
Well, this morning you said yourself
that when it comes to eating,

10:25.666 --> 10:29.420
-you just grab whatever you can.
-Can we use "I" statements?

10:29.503 --> 10:31.505
[shouts] Ai, ai, ai! You took my cheese!

10:31.589 --> 10:34.258
You probably ate it yourself
during one of your night terrors!

10:34.342 --> 10:36.761
We know you opened the fridge.
You put my keys in there.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.471
I can't eat while I'm terrified.

10:38.554 --> 10:42.642
That's why I'll never know
the delicious crunch of Count Chocula.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.810
-[shudders]
-That still doesn't mean I took it.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.729
-You will both have a chance to--
-Come on!

10:46.812 --> 10:50.358
We both know you drift around
the apartment like you own the place.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.985
-It's my apartment!
-[shouts and thumps] And it's my cheese!

10:53.069 --> 10:54.236
Oh, boy.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.363
[tires screech]

10:56.822 --> 10:58.908
-[grunts] Who do you think you are?
-[gasps] Uh...

10:58.991 --> 11:00.660
-I'm Dr. Indir--
-I know who you are!

11:00.743 --> 11:02.912
You know how many therapists
there are named Indira?

11:02.995 --> 11:05.122
Google filled in your last name for me.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.375
Why did you tell Diana
that she needed space from me?

11:07.458 --> 11:08.751
Would you like to have a seat?

11:08.834 --> 11:11.420
No, I don't wanna "have a seat,"
and here's why.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.464
Therapists are manipulative leeches...

11:16.050 --> 11:19.470
So, when Jerry Lewis
mistook me for the valet,

11:19.553 --> 11:22.682
he was carrying so much pain
I could never fathom.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.100
-Mm...
-And that realization

11:24.183 --> 11:28.145
allows me to forgive.
Not for his sake, but for mine.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.231
-Mm-hmm.
-Wow. How long was I talking?

11:30.314 --> 11:33.317
I hope that was cathartic for you.
You wanna come back same time tomorrow?

11:33.401 --> 11:38.489
Wait a minute, I see what's going on here.
Are you... my new best friend?

11:38.698 --> 11:39.949
[sighs] Uh...?

11:40.991 --> 11:44.120
Ugh, I'm sorry, I feel like I'm hogging
all the conversation.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.455
There's definitely more to your story
than mine.

11:46.539 --> 11:50.209
Mine's more like a secondary story.
A B-story, if you will.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.753
I have a feeling it will continue
to offer a light alternative,

11:52.837 --> 11:54.839
as my story gets increasingly serious.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.717
Let's continue to switch back and forth
between our stories,

11:57.800 --> 11:59.677
pausing at their most interesting moments.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.179
That feels like the most natural way
to have a conversation.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.056
Well, while I was talking to BoBo,

12:04.140 --> 12:05.933
Diana was trying to keep things together

12:06.016 --> 12:07.435
-on set.
-I thought it was my turn.

12:07.768 --> 12:11.480
-[gasps] Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
-[Diana] Okay, cut?

12:11.564 --> 12:14.358
-[buzzer blares]
-Why is Sassy saying "Oh, my God?"

12:14.442 --> 12:16.277
I just figured,
we've got all these people here,

12:16.360 --> 12:17.778
we might as well film some stuff.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.656
Presumably something shocking will happen,
and then if it does,

12:20.740 --> 12:23.200
we have a shot of you saying,
[mimics Gino] "Oh, my God!"

12:23.284 --> 12:25.202
-Makes sense.
-Diana, can I talk to you for a sec?

12:25.286 --> 12:27.705
I know you're going through something,
and need boundaries,

12:27.788 --> 12:29.123
but this isn't personal,

12:29.206 --> 12:30.374
-it's about the show.
-Ah!

12:30.750 --> 12:32.084
[Diana grunts, sighs] What is it?

12:32.168 --> 12:33.544
I lied. It's a 100% personal.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.379
-What?
-But it's good! You're gonna like this.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.131
-Remember you said you needed space?
-Yes.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.216
When you told me that,
I didn't take it well.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.718
-Uh...
-But I made a new friend,

12:40.801 --> 12:43.012
-so everything is good now.
-Oh. Well, that's great.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.930
I'm glad you think so because, fun twist,

12:45.014 --> 12:46.182
-it's Dr. Indira.
-What?

12:46.265 --> 12:49.059
I'm seeing Dr. Indira now, as a friend.
Dr. Indira's my new friend.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.102
-No.
-What?

12:50.186 --> 12:53.063
It's great that you would wanna talk
to someone, and you should!

12:53.147 --> 12:56.108
But she's mine.
I really need her to just be mine.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.986
-Can you understand that?
-[sighs] Yeah.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.910
Diana asked me not to be friends with you,
so out of respect for her,

13:05.993 --> 13:10.206
I think it's best that I continue
seeing you behind her back.

13:10.414 --> 13:13.167
We can still do our lunchtime hang outs,
but to cover our tracks,

13:13.250 --> 13:15.169
I'll compensate you
for your time on the books.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.629
Ιt'll seem as if you have a client.

13:16.712 --> 13:19.548
And, to be safe, we should invoke
a therapist-to-friend confidentiality.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.466
How's that sound?

13:23.302 --> 13:26.514
So, in my dreams, I'm Philbert,
and sometimes when I wake up,

13:26.597 --> 13:28.808
I don't know if I'm Philbert or if I'm me,

13:28.891 --> 13:30.726
-or if I'm still dreaming.
-[watch beeping]

13:30.810 --> 13:33.479
Oh, that's our time of friendship hour.

13:33.562 --> 13:37.107
I'm just so glad that I can help break up
your day of listening to whiny babies

13:37.191 --> 13:39.151
with some entertaining lunchtime convo.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.695
Should I have told him
what we were doing was therapy?

13:41.779 --> 13:43.948
On some level, he must have known
what was going on.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.199
What I don't understand is,

13:45.282 --> 13:47.785
if you knew Diana asked him
not to see you--

13:47.868 --> 13:51.121
I'm a therapist. A doctor heals.
A DJ spins.

13:51.205 --> 13:54.750
Jessica Chastain takes whatever gig
Amy Adams says no to.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.126
My job is to listen.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.337
And at that moment,
BoBo needed someone to listen.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.630
I know the feeling.

13:59.922 --> 14:03.425
Okay, we've been going back and forth
for two hours.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.804
Can we take a break?
I gotta use the bathroom. If I even can!

14:06.887 --> 14:10.057
Maybe it's just another hand down there!
Guess I'll find out!

14:10.432 --> 14:12.601
Why not just say you took the cheese?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.770
-Because I didn't.
-You want an office, right?

14:14.854 --> 14:18.065
There's nothing wrong with telling
a small lie to avoid a fight.

14:18.148 --> 14:21.861
I do it all the time with my wife,
Doctor, uh, Underwear.

14:22.236 --> 14:25.239
-Heh?
-I love your new hairstyle, honey.

14:25.948 --> 14:30.160
-Did you not like my new hairstyle?
-Oh! Um... Back to my story...

14:30.411 --> 14:32.788
All you have to do
is tell Emperor Finger-Face

14:32.872 --> 14:34.081
what he wants to hear.

14:34.164 --> 14:37.710
Fifty-nine cents worth of edible string
for a brand-new office?

14:37.793 --> 14:38.878
Wouldn't you take that deal?

14:39.336 --> 14:43.966
So, turns out I can use the bathroom,
but it comes out in tiny cubes!

14:44.049 --> 14:46.677
Hey. I took the string cheese.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.512
Ha, ha! I knew it!

14:48.596 --> 14:52.683
Wonderful. So, she can replace the cheese
and you'll give her an office. We did it!

14:52.766 --> 14:54.768
Great! Let me just grab my pen.

14:54.852 --> 14:59.023
-But even if I did take the cheese--
-Which you just admitted you did!

14:59.106 --> 15:00.065
Would I be in the wrong?

15:00.149 --> 15:03.110
I mean, it is kind of a "fair game food,"
don't you think?

15:03.193 --> 15:05.029
-What?
-It's not like it's a sandwich.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.448
Some foods are just widely understood
to be up for grabs.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.033
-No. You guys.
-[Finger-Face] Okay.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.994
Well, then let's make a list
of fair game foods.

15:12.077 --> 15:17.291
Grapes. Fair game. Eggs. Fair game.
An unsliced pie. Not fair game.

15:17.374 --> 15:21.921
A sliced pie. Fair game.
The last slice. Not fair game.

15:22.004 --> 15:25.299
Then let's also make a list
of what's fair game to me in my apartment.

15:25.382 --> 15:28.594
Oh, that's right, everything,
you literal knucklehead.

15:28.677 --> 15:33.223
Oh, ho-ho!
That's a solid diss coming from a gas.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.559
Please, you two,
we can still reach an agreement.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.687
I don't know. I think this might go
beyond simple mediation.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.106
-No!
-Damn it, we're going to arbitration!

15:41.190 --> 15:43.984
[shouts]  Nooooooooooo!

15:44.818 --> 15:49.865
Hey, Flippy. I got everyone saying,
"Oh, my God." How's it going in here?

15:49.990 --> 15:55.287
"Interior sub. Philbert. Philbert.
Flap, flap, flippy, flap. Fart. Barf.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.705
Barf me a river, fartbag."

15:56.789 --> 15:58.290
[squeaking]

15:58.374 --> 16:00.376
What's going on in here?

16:00.459 --> 16:01.710
[squeaking continues]

16:03.879 --> 16:05.172
If it relieves any pressure,

16:05.255 --> 16:07.716
I don't know that everyone thinks
you're a brilliant genius.

16:09.551 --> 16:10.678
I think we need to simplify.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.681
Let's start with Fritz.
Is he a ghost or is he not a ghost?

16:14.765 --> 16:16.850
Can't he just be a ghost?

16:17.977 --> 16:22.147
So, why is Philbert seeing a ghost?
Maybe he feels haunted?

16:22.231 --> 16:25.442
And Fritz represents that?
What is haunting Philbert?

16:26.485 --> 16:30.823
That's great. But also...
Maybe something involving a submarine?

16:33.117 --> 16:34.076
You keep thinking.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.412
Hey, are we about to shoot something?

16:36.495 --> 16:38.706
I'm meeting a friend for lunch.
You don't know her.

16:38.789 --> 16:39.873
It's gonna be a while still.

16:39.957 --> 16:43.585
Flippy is working through his "process."
And I am helping.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.837
Sounds good. Just remember,

16:44.920 --> 16:47.339
you are not responsible
for the dysfunction of others.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.465
What?

16:48.549 --> 16:50.217
I'm just saying don't let him
get you down.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.678
Where did you hear that?
About the dysfunction of others?

16:52.761 --> 16:55.139
I don't know. Just around.
It's a thing people say.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.140
[Diana] Mm...

16:56.223 --> 16:58.350
Hey, are we gonna get new pages today
or what?

16:58.600 --> 17:00.811
W-w-wait, did you say "Princess Carolyn"?

17:00.894 --> 17:03.772
I'm sorry, "Priscilla Crustacean."

17:04.023 --> 17:05.858
Vamanos,  on the pages, okay?

17:05.941 --> 17:08.944
I've been here all day today,
Wednesday, October 24th,

17:09.028 --> 17:12.281
waiting for something to shoot.
Andele, andele, andele!

17:12.531 --> 17:16.076
I think your Priscilla Crustacean
is the same person

17:16.160 --> 17:19.830
as my Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning
in the shape of a woman!

17:19.913 --> 17:22.833
And if she was on set all day
Wednesday, that means--

17:22.916 --> 17:25.210
Bu-- Hold on,
I'm getting to the juicy part.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.130
As soon as I get the thing,
I don't want it anymore.

17:28.213 --> 17:31.383
It feels cheap.
So, no, I wouldn't like a bottle of water.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.135
-[Diana grunts]
-Emotionally naked!

17:33.218 --> 17:34.762
-I knew it!
-Diana! Let me explain.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.139
How long has he been your client?

17:37.222 --> 17:38.098
-Not a client.
-Three--

17:38.182 --> 17:40.225
Days. Friends for three days.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.352
I asked you not to see her.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.397
I asked for one part of my life
that I could have to myself.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.608
News flash, you're not the only one
going through shit.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.109
Maybe if I could talk to you,

17:49.193 --> 17:51.028
I wouldn't need to be looking
for other friends.

17:51.111 --> 17:54.114
Diana, is there anything you'd like
to discuss with BoBo?

17:54.198 --> 17:56.408
We can do it right here.
This is a safe space.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.161
No. This doesn't feel
like a safe space anymore.

17:59.244 --> 18:02.331
I can't keep coming here
if I know you're also seeing him.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.919
Then it sounds like
our time together is done.

18:07.002 --> 18:07.836
What?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.630
You're setting a boundary.It is good.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.548
Go forth with the tools I've given you.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.218
Live your life, Diana.
Like a candle in the wind.

18:14.301 --> 18:17.221
-I can't believe this is happening.
-I think BoBo needs me more.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.139
-Would you like validation?
-No.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.601
Your validation is worthless to me now.
You two deserve each other.

18:22.768 --> 18:23.602
[grunts]

18:24.728 --> 18:27.189
Oh, you meant parking validation.
I actually would like that.

18:27.856 --> 18:31.777
Wow, I can't believe you chose BoBo
over your client of seven years.

18:31.860 --> 18:32.694
At a certain point,

18:32.778 --> 18:35.906
I can't hold myself responsible
for other people's dysfunction.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.158
I mean, that is kind of your job.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.869
But at least now you can help
the Angsty Zebra, right?

18:40.953 --> 18:42.079
Well...

18:42.287 --> 18:45.165
-Okay. Now for the real work to begin.
-Real what now?

18:45.249 --> 18:47.501
You did the hard part,
admitting you need help.

18:47.584 --> 18:48.418
Did I admit that?

18:48.502 --> 18:51.171
And now comes the even harder part,
getting the help.

18:51.255 --> 18:54.424
-Let's talk about your mother.
-You know what? This has been great.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.552
I got what I wanted
and I made so much progress!

18:56.635 --> 18:58.137
So, I think I'm done?

18:58.220 --> 18:59.221
-Yes. You did it!
-I--

18:59.304 --> 19:02.307
You changed my stripes!
Dr. Indira, you're great at your job!

19:02.391 --> 19:04.601
-Goodbye forever.
-W-w-w-wait!

19:04.852 --> 19:07.604
I can't believe I lost two clients
in one day.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.189
You're focusing on the negative.

19:09.273 --> 19:12.568
I'm sure you helped them
in ways you'll never know.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.949
This area's all mine.
This is fair game. Ya see the line?

19:19.032 --> 19:20.367
What about popcorn?

19:20.450 --> 19:23.453
Popped is mine. Unpopped is fair game.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.872
-[ringtone playing]
-[phone beeps]

19:24.955 --> 19:26.039
-Hello?
-[Mary-Beth]  Todd.

19:26.123 --> 19:29.835
Princess Carolyn was on set all day,
the day of the string cheese theft.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.045
She was not home
when the cheese went missing,

19:32.129 --> 19:36.758
rendering any arbitration agreement made
under those conditions null and void.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.011
Whoa! Thanks a lot, Mary-Beth.

19:39.094 --> 19:42.764
Just doing my job, kid.
A doctor heals. A DJ spins.

19:42.848 --> 19:46.560
Bryce Dallas Howard takes the gigs,
Jessica Chastain says no to.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.604
And Mary-Beth mediates.

19:49.062 --> 19:52.024
So, it sounds like
you didn't take my string cheese.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.442
That's what I've been saying!

19:53.567 --> 19:56.778
I don't even know why we had to go through
corporate mediation in the first place!

19:56.904 --> 19:59.489
I guess I just wanted it to be
a workplace dispute,

19:59.573 --> 20:02.284
because I thought if you knew
it was a roommate dispute,

20:02.367 --> 20:03.619
you might kick me out.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.413
I'm not gonna kick you out.
I like having you around.

20:06.496 --> 20:07.706
Oh, really?

20:07.789 --> 20:09.833
Who else would I get to keep my keys cold?

20:09.917 --> 20:12.169
You know, I have this job now.

20:12.252 --> 20:17.216
Maybe I could start paying,
I believe it's pronounced "roaunnt?"

20:17.299 --> 20:19.468
Rent? Well. That's a great idea.

20:19.551 --> 20:23.597
But I also need my own space.
Which is why I wanted that office.

20:23.680 --> 20:27.768
Well, then, let's get you that office.
I just need to grab my pen.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.230
-Hey!
-Ugh!

20:32.981 --> 20:39.238
Hey. I want to apologize...
for my behavior at Dr. Indira's.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.864
-Don't worry about it.
-She was right.

20:40.948 --> 20:44.534
You need her more than I do.
And I think she can really help you.

20:44.618 --> 20:45.535
Help with what?

20:45.619 --> 20:47.871
I was looking for someone
to hang out with during my lunch.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.998
I didn't want some
psycho-babbling quack job

20:50.082 --> 20:52.125
telling me to get in touch
with my feelings.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.461
-Who needs that?
-I do. I need that.

20:54.544 --> 20:57.297
You don't anymore!
She said it herself, you're fixed!

20:57.381 --> 20:58.799
And then after you left, I was like,

20:58.882 --> 21:01.301
"Hey, if Diane doesn't need this,
I don't need this."

21:01.385 --> 21:02.219
Wait, you quit?

21:02.302 --> 21:05.013
Yeah, I'm not someone therapy works on.
I might be too smart.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.891
Oh, my God. You haven't changed at all.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.060
Whoa, whoa.
Diane, no, no. I'm not the problem here.

21:10.143 --> 21:12.729
None of this would have happened
if I felt like I could talk to you,

21:12.813 --> 21:14.523
my friend, after my mother died.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.025
So, would you like to talk
about your mother?

21:17.109 --> 21:18.986
No, I'm just saying as an example.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.737
Why do you bring things back to my mother?

21:20.821 --> 21:22.447
I can't keep playing this game with you.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.200
You say you wanna get better
and you don't know how.

21:25.284 --> 21:29.162
Well, here's me, your friend,
telling you how: get therapy.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.998
Otherwise, don't waste my time.

21:31.081 --> 21:34.501
Uh, you heard Dr. Indira.
She said we don't need her.

21:34.584 --> 21:35.752
She said I don't need her!

21:35.836 --> 21:37.796
I know, but you're just as screwed up
as I am.

21:37.879 --> 21:40.757
-So, if--
-I am not as screwed up as you are.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.176
Diane, it's me. Come on. We're the same.

21:43.260 --> 21:46.513
[gasps] We are not the same!

21:47.264 --> 21:48.223
-[Diane grunts]
-Whoa.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.058
-[Diane huffs, hums]
-[typing]

21:50.434 --> 21:51.268
Whoa.

21:51.351 --> 21:55.689
That's good stuff. We're doing it, Diane.
We're doing it!

21:57.107 --> 21:59.651
I wanna thank everyone
for being so kind this week.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.403
Losing a mother is not easy,

22:01.486 --> 22:05.615
but I am so lucky to have
the support system of my Philbert family.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.784
You know who I really feel bad for
is my dad.

22:07.868 --> 22:12.205
He's out on that farm all by himself,
and-- Oh, my God. My dad is dead!

22:12.289 --> 22:14.249
-[all] Aw.
-Cheer up, everyone!

22:14.333 --> 22:16.460
-We got new pages!
-All right!

22:16.543 --> 22:19.379
We're gonna film in the living room
with Philbert and Sassy Malone first.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.465
We're moving into the submarine
for the flashback.

22:21.548 --> 22:23.884
No time to learn lines.
We gotta make up for the lost days,

22:23.967 --> 22:26.386
so we're gonna put the whole thing
on cue cards. Let's go!

22:26.470 --> 22:28.180
-All right, everybody stand back.
-[murmus]

22:28.263 --> 22:30.265
[sobbing]

22:30.349 --> 22:31.808
We need lights on the living room!

22:31.892 --> 22:33.435
And action!

22:33.560 --> 22:35.479
Tell me what happened
in the submarine, Philbert.

22:35.562 --> 22:39.149
We were doing a routine
submarine sting operation.

22:39.232 --> 22:40.359
Things got outta hand.

22:40.442 --> 22:44.654
-Hey. Who do you work for?
-Well, I sure as hell don't work for tips.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.031
-[chuckles]
-[men gasping]

22:46.114 --> 22:48.075
Okay. Hey, Fritz. Be cool. Everybody cool.

22:48.158 --> 22:52.162
We are in a pressurized submarine
in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.538
Mm.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.290
Easy... [inhales]

22:55.707 --> 22:57.376
-[all gasping, grunting]
-[gunfire]

22:59.753 --> 23:02.422
-Oh, my God! You killed them all?
-We had to.

23:02.631 --> 23:03.673
These poor guys.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.885
I wonder if they had kids,
families who will never know--

23:06.968 --> 23:08.678
Can you just say the lines, please?

23:08.970 --> 23:10.472
Barf me a river, fartbags.

23:10.597 --> 23:12.265
We gotta make this look like an accident.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.768
You grab the contraband,
I'll set up the explosives. [panting]

23:14.851 --> 23:17.229
[BoJack]  I went to the room
where they were keeping the stuff.

23:18.939 --> 23:21.608
-Only there was no stuff.
-Oh, my God!

23:21.691 --> 23:25.404
There was a girl there.
She couldn't have been older than 17.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.321
Bring in the girl!

23:26.405 --> 23:27.447
What? What is this?

23:27.531 --> 23:29.616
Keep going! We gotta get this tonight!

23:30.117 --> 23:30.992
[Gina]  A girl?

23:31.076 --> 23:34.496
[BoJack]  They weren't smuggling drugs.
They were smuggling... her.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.290
-Hey. Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine. Just do the scene.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.042
[Bojack]  I told her
it was going to be okay.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.877
And... she kissed me.

23:40.961 --> 23:41.920
Wha--?

23:42.003 --> 23:43.839
What did you do to her, Philbert?

23:43.922 --> 23:45.590
Nothing. Like I said, she kissed me.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.717
-Kiss her back.
-What?

23:47.801 --> 23:49.511
We need to get you kissing her back.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.846
-What?
-Kiss me, you idiot.

23:51.012 --> 23:51.888
Kiss her!

23:51.972 --> 23:53.014
[both moaning]

23:54.099 --> 23:56.518
This whole thing is gonna blow.
We gotta bounce, friendo.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.146
If Fritz hadn't come,
what would you have done with the girl?

23:59.229 --> 24:01.356
[Bojack] Part of me is sure
I couldn't go through.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.191
But another part knows that's a lie.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.860
-We can't just leave her.
-[whimpering]

24:04.943 --> 24:06.319
Use your brain, Philbert!

24:06.403 --> 24:08.738
Malone, you gotta believe me.
I'm a good guy.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.740
If I'd known she was there,
I never would've--

24:10.824 --> 24:12.534
-Tell me what happened.
-I'll be back.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.703
-You wait right here.
-Come on, loverboy.

24:15.954 --> 24:19.291
You kissed a young girl
and then left her to die.

24:19.374 --> 24:21.960
I'm a good guy.
I didn't know that she was--

24:22.043 --> 24:23.753
You have to understand, I'm a good guy.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.131
-She trusted you.
-How do you make something right

24:26.214 --> 24:29.926
when you've made it so wrong,
you can never go back?

24:30.093 --> 24:31.928
How did you come up with all this?

24:32.012 --> 24:35.223
It's a story I heard once.
I just changed all the names.

24:35.390 --> 24:37.309
I'll never forget that night on The...

24:38.351 --> 24:40.103
U.S.S. New Mexico.

24:40.187 --> 24:41.646
Why are you telling me all this?

24:41.938 --> 24:43.899
It's just good to have someone to talk to.

24:44.524 --> 24:45.442
[Flip] Cut!

24:45.525 --> 24:48.111
-[buzzer blares]
-Amazing! I'm a genius!

24:52.908 --> 24:55.243
[music playing]
