WEBVTT

00:10.190 --> 00:13.660
The living
don't stand a chance here.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.130
I feel like
we're being watched.

00:15.230 --> 00:16.600
- You do.
- Yes.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.100
I feel like he would
hunt me down and kill me.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.940
I had a couple cases
of beer.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.270
Right after I left the room,
they fell.

00:24.370 --> 00:27.280
There's also, like, a lot
of sex and bad --

00:27.380 --> 00:28.680
it's so bad.

00:28.780 --> 00:29.980
A lot of times,

00:30.080 --> 00:32.180
these women would get
black market abortions.

00:32.280 --> 00:37.020
This man was a killer.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.750
I just hear death.

00:38.860 --> 00:41.020
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.760
God.

00:42.860 --> 00:44.930
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

00:45.030 --> 00:46.090
I see dead people.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.300
Her face was all demonic.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.100
I speak to dead people...

00:49.200 --> 00:52.000
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

00:52.100 --> 00:53.400
...and they speak to me.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.370
- What is he trying to do?
- Kill them.

00:55.470 --> 00:58.070
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

00:58.180 --> 00:59.970
Something happened.
Bam. Bam. Bam.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.140
I rely on my partner.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.680
I'm Steve Di Shiavi.

01:02.780 --> 01:04.950
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:05.050 --> 01:06.410
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

01:06.520 --> 01:10.020
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.920
- They're everywhere.
- It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.020 --> 01:14.720
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

01:14.830 --> 01:17.090
But Steve and I
never speak...

01:17.190 --> 01:19.160
We never communicate
during an investigation...

01:19.260 --> 01:20.430
...until the very end...

01:20.530 --> 01:22.030
Is this dead guy
doing that to her?

01:22.130 --> 01:23.830
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:23.930 --> 01:26.000
That's it.

01:26.100 --> 01:27.900
...or time to get out.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.270
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon. Yeah.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

01:43.920 --> 01:46.250
I'm in Paso Robles, California.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.720
It's halfway between LA
and San Francisco.

01:48.830 --> 01:50.730
I got a call
from a guy named Ron.

01:50.830 --> 01:53.190
Now, he owns a historic bar
in town,

01:53.300 --> 01:56.530
but activity's so bad employees
are quittin'

01:56.630 --> 01:58.970
and regular customers
are staying away.

01:59.070 --> 02:01.600
The last thing he wants to do
is shut the place down,

02:01.710 --> 02:03.100
but if Amy and I can't help,

02:03.210 --> 02:05.210
that's exactly what
he's gonna have to do.

02:09.250 --> 02:11.550
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the area

02:11.650 --> 02:14.580
of anything that might
influence her findings.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.990
This is a large space with a lot
of artwork and signs

02:18.090 --> 02:19.690
that need to be covered.

02:19.790 --> 02:21.690
When I'm finished,
the location'll be ready

02:21.790 --> 02:23.560
for tonight's walk.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.700
Boy. I don't like this.

02:35.810 --> 02:37.740
So there's a female.

02:37.840 --> 02:41.810
I got...
really creeped out by her.

02:41.910 --> 02:44.480
She's almost...

02:44.580 --> 02:48.020
like, a <i> real</i> shadow person,

02:48.120 --> 02:49.920
but she's a dead person.

02:51.620 --> 02:55.320
After she died,
she plucked out her eyes

02:55.430 --> 03:00.090
because she didn't wanna
see anymore.

03:00.200 --> 03:04.630
She made her face just a skull

03:04.730 --> 03:06.700
so that other dead people, like,

03:06.800 --> 03:09.340
around here and around town

03:09.440 --> 03:11.010
call her "The Reaper."

03:12.580 --> 03:16.110
She definitely makes me
very uncomfortable.

03:16.210 --> 03:20.010
She is very angry.
She's bent on revenge.

03:26.990 --> 03:28.260
So, Ron, when we spoke
on the phone,

03:28.360 --> 03:29.260
you sounded pretty upset

03:29.360 --> 03:30.690
about the things
that are happening here.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.030
I mean,
what the hell's going on?

03:32.130 --> 03:34.000
I'm hearing things
from my employees.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.200
I'm hearing things
from my customers.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.800
Something's happening.

03:37.900 --> 03:39.100
I'm not sure what it is,

03:39.200 --> 03:41.040
but whatever it is, I need
to get it taken care of

03:41.140 --> 03:43.300
before somebody actually
does get hurt.

03:43.410 --> 03:45.970
Okay. Tell me, what -- what are
things that are going on here?

03:46.080 --> 03:48.310
Well, my customers and employees
are telling me

03:48.410 --> 03:52.650
they're hearing noises,
they're seeing apparitions.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.720
Things are moving around,

03:54.820 --> 03:58.290
and it's gettin'
physical, so...

03:58.390 --> 04:00.390
Sounds like this is
all happening to other people.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.390
Actually, I have seen
a few things myself.

04:03.490 --> 04:04.890
Okay. Like what?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.160
One of them was,
I was --

04:06.260 --> 04:08.300
I was standing
at the end of the bar

04:08.400 --> 04:10.870
and just looking down
the bar,

04:10.970 --> 04:16.000
and I saw this shot glass
go from here to here.

04:16.110 --> 04:18.839
The second thing was
by my coffee machine over there,

04:18.940 --> 04:20.240
I had a jar

04:20.339 --> 04:24.380
that literally went over the top
of some wine glasses

04:24.480 --> 04:25.910
and just went off
on the ground.

04:26.020 --> 04:28.120
Was anybody around
to knock it over?

04:28.220 --> 04:29.320
No.

04:29.420 --> 04:31.420
Why don't you just
sell it and walk away?

04:31.520 --> 04:33.660
Well, one reason
is because my mom

04:33.760 --> 04:35.760
started this place
45 years ago,

04:35.860 --> 04:37.860
and, you know, and I took it
over about 5 years ago,

04:37.960 --> 04:40.330
and I wanna keep it going
for her.

04:40.430 --> 04:41.600
There's also another reason.

04:41.700 --> 04:44.330
It's kind of like a mainstay
in this town.

04:44.430 --> 04:48.440
It's one of the oldest buildings
in Paso Robles.

04:48.540 --> 04:50.770
There's a lot of weird things
happening around here.

04:50.870 --> 04:52.140
I need some help.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.810
I need to know what it is
and I need to get rid of it.

04:54.910 --> 04:56.640
Okay.

04:58.850 --> 05:01.750
It doesn't feel very right.

05:05.090 --> 05:06.950
It doesn't feel right.

05:07.060 --> 05:09.890
The shadow woman
is like a hunter.

05:09.990 --> 05:13.330
Her voice sounds like...

05:13.430 --> 05:15.160
death.

05:15.270 --> 05:17.930
Like, if you hear it,
like, she's coming for you.

05:18.030 --> 05:20.870
You get that cold down --
all the way down,

05:20.970 --> 05:24.110
like, from the neck
and all the way down.

05:26.380 --> 05:28.940
So she can get
physically violent here.

05:29.050 --> 05:32.310
I know, too, she definitely
follows somebody

05:32.420 --> 05:34.920
and has, tried to,

05:35.020 --> 05:38.050
harm them, in their homes

05:38.150 --> 05:40.150
on several occasions.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.090
So why'd you bring me
in here?

05:46.200 --> 05:48.900
Well, I've had many reports
of things happening in here.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.170
Okay. Did you ever see
any of this stuff?

05:51.270 --> 05:55.870
No, I never did, so I decided
I'd stick some cameras in here.

05:55.970 --> 05:57.340
All right.
Did you catch anything?

05:57.440 --> 05:59.170
I did.

06:01.080 --> 06:05.150
I had a couple cases of beer
just went off the stack

06:05.250 --> 06:09.420
right after I left the room,
and they fell.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.150
We're in California. You sure
it wasn't an earthquake?

06:11.250 --> 06:12.920
Yeah, I'm sure because if
it was an earthquake,

06:13.020 --> 06:14.860
half of my storeroom
would've been on the floor.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.630
And I can't figure out
how the hell this...

06:17.730 --> 06:18.960
This could be dangerous.

06:19.060 --> 06:20.630
Yes. Yes.

06:20.730 --> 06:21.960
Anything else going on
in this room?

06:22.070 --> 06:23.700
I had an employee workin'
back here in the bar,

06:23.800 --> 06:26.300
and she was looking
over in that corner.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.040
There was about
an 8, 10-inch knife

06:28.140 --> 06:30.740
laying on a tray,
and the knife just went...

06:30.840 --> 06:32.510
Like that.

06:32.610 --> 06:34.310
And it missed her by...

06:34.410 --> 06:35.540
It could've been worse,

06:35.650 --> 06:37.710
and we just lucked out
on that one, I think.

06:37.810 --> 06:40.050
Yeah. She could've gotten
seriously hurt.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.520
The shadow woman,
she's physically capable

06:44.620 --> 06:45.920
of hurting people.

06:46.020 --> 06:48.390
- How?
- She runs around with a knife.

06:51.730 --> 06:53.490
Maybe they feel sharp pains
or something.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.560
I don't know.

06:55.670 --> 06:58.630
She also attacked people
in their throat area.

06:58.740 --> 07:01.840
She's so creepy.
She's so **** creepy.

07:01.940 --> 07:05.670
And she's, like,
really freaking the **** out.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.080
She's hurtin' me.

07:12.180 --> 07:14.150
Ay. She's hurtin' me.

07:20.620 --> 07:22.460
So, Ron, what's the story
with the second floor here?

07:22.560 --> 07:24.360
The history is it used
to be a brothel,

07:24.460 --> 07:26.160
but I use it strictly now
for my customers

07:26.260 --> 07:29.660
as a place to rest when they've
had too much to drink.

07:29.770 --> 07:31.270
All right. So is anything
going on up here?

07:31.370 --> 07:32.470
Some people have told me

07:32.570 --> 07:35.070
about somebody was hanging
from the ceiling.

07:35.170 --> 07:39.010
All right. So, how did they
describe this thing to you?

07:39.110 --> 07:41.610
They told me that
they saw something hanging

07:41.710 --> 07:43.440
or like they were holding on
to the ceiling.

07:43.550 --> 07:44.850
And they -- they --
they described him

07:44.950 --> 07:46.950
as like a mannequin
or like a person.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.320
Okay. Anything else?

07:48.420 --> 07:50.120
I had a couple
from down South.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.890
When they came back down,
I noticed the lady was,

07:52.990 --> 07:55.320
like, 5, 6 shades lighter.

07:55.430 --> 07:56.420
And I was like,
"What the heck?"

07:56.530 --> 07:57.660
I said, "What'd you guys do
up there?"

07:57.760 --> 07:59.390
And the wife,

07:59.500 --> 08:01.130
just out of nowhere, said,
"It grabbed my butt.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.960
It grabbed my butt," and that's
all she could say, was,

08:03.070 --> 08:04.730
"It grabbed my butt."

08:04.830 --> 08:06.970
I have a camera
that's up here in the corner.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.540
Well, I thought,
Okay, let me check and see

08:08.640 --> 08:13.140
if it's in that camera,
and by golly, I found something.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.340
I did keep the video
of that one.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.550
Wow.
Something touched her

08:21.650 --> 08:24.450
because you can tell by
her reaction that's not acting.

08:27.490 --> 08:29.760
You know, most of the time,
I get photos,

08:29.860 --> 08:31.930
and I look at them
with a...

08:32.030 --> 08:34.299
You know, like, "Hey,
any photo can be doctored."

08:34.400 --> 08:35.730
Right. Right.

08:35.830 --> 08:39.630
But unless you got some tech guy
that can fix video like this,

08:39.740 --> 08:41.700
this is some pretty compelling
evidence you got.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.570
- Yes.
- If Amy suggested

08:43.669 --> 08:45.410
that you should leave,
how would you take that?

08:45.510 --> 08:46.670
It'd be pretty tough.

08:46.780 --> 08:50.180
This has been in my family
for 45 years.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.650
I don't wanna get rid of it,
and I will do whatever it takes.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.080
Okay.

08:57.220 --> 09:01.390
The shadow woman,
she's also able to jump people,

09:01.490 --> 09:04.330
living people
who are sensitives.

09:11.370 --> 09:13.570
The shadow woman is up here.

09:16.410 --> 09:18.270
She kind of goes in between

09:18.370 --> 09:21.410
where the ceiling
and the walls meet,

09:21.510 --> 09:23.010
and then she'll
spread herself out,

09:23.110 --> 09:25.750
and she can put her face
and her arms down.

09:28.320 --> 09:32.290
I feel like this is a very,
very, very bad thing.

09:32.390 --> 09:33.490
Like, I feel panicked.

09:57.980 --> 09:59.050
So, Kim,
I was talking to Ron.

09:59.150 --> 10:01.320
He said you worked here,
but you recently left.

10:01.420 --> 10:03.480
Yes, I did.
Okay. How long
did you work here?

10:03.590 --> 10:04.920
Almost 7 years.

10:05.020 --> 10:07.390
Why'd you leave?
I'm curious.

10:07.490 --> 10:12.730
I think the paranormal activity
is becoming more, um,

10:12.830 --> 10:15.600
direct, more violent.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.970
For my safety,
I had to go.

10:19.070 --> 10:20.500
So now Ron mentioned
to me about,

10:20.600 --> 10:23.040
customers havin'
experiences up here.

10:23.140 --> 10:25.870
Now have they told you
the same thing?

10:25.980 --> 10:27.170
Yes, many, many times.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.410
I have customers that refuse
to come back up here.

10:30.510 --> 10:32.910
There are customers
that have been so scared

10:33.020 --> 10:35.350
that they will not return
to the saloon.

10:35.450 --> 10:38.390
Okay. So what have you seen
or experienced?

10:38.490 --> 10:40.220
Anything that you can
tell me about?

10:40.320 --> 10:42.490
Yes.
We have a vacuum upstairs

10:42.590 --> 10:46.190
that was moving up here
in the hallway,

10:46.300 --> 10:50.230
but the electrical cord
was wrapped all the way around.

10:50.330 --> 10:53.100
It was moving freely,
as if somebody was vacuuming.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.470
So you didn't see anybody
holding it.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.840
There was nobody holding it.

10:55.940 --> 10:57.640
There was nobody up here.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.940
That scared me.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.910
That convinced me.

11:01.010 --> 11:02.210
Okay. Anything else?

11:02.310 --> 11:06.110
There is a presence
that you feel

11:06.220 --> 11:08.350
when you come into
this place.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.480
You always feel
like you're being watched.

11:10.590 --> 11:12.250
I won't stay up here.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.550
By doing that,

11:13.660 --> 11:15.690
I'm challenging or welcoming
something to happen to me.

11:15.790 --> 11:17.890
Are you feeling
any of that now?

11:17.990 --> 11:19.360
I feel like
we're being watched.

11:19.460 --> 11:20.430
- You do?
- Yes.

11:20.530 --> 11:22.730
There is an energy
in this building.

11:22.830 --> 11:25.570
By coming up here,
I become a target.

11:25.670 --> 11:27.440
Okay.

11:29.270 --> 11:32.940
There's, like, somebody saying,
"I know you. You know me."

11:33.040 --> 11:37.480
"I know you. You know me."
"I know you. You know me."

11:37.580 --> 11:39.180
And this is a dead person.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.380
He's like, "I know you.
We've met."

11:41.480 --> 11:42.950
Yeah, I don't like him.
I don't like him.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.850
There's something wrong.

11:44.950 --> 11:46.650
I'm feeling pain right here...

11:46.760 --> 11:48.760
and right into my throat.

11:48.860 --> 11:50.490
It feels like I'm being stabbed.

11:53.330 --> 11:55.830
My leg -- I feel like
I'm being stabbed there.

11:55.930 --> 11:58.430
Who is this person?
I don't know.

11:58.530 --> 12:01.640
He's crazy, totally insane.

12:01.740 --> 12:05.310
I don't like this.
I feel threatened.

12:05.410 --> 12:09.710
I fe-- I don't feel safe at all
with this person.

12:09.810 --> 12:13.410
He thinks, like, I'm -- like I'm
ratting on him or something.

12:13.520 --> 12:16.320
I'm thinking that he can
probably do a lot of bad things,

12:16.420 --> 12:18.620
like, really, really ****
bad things.

12:18.720 --> 12:19.890
Like, I feel like -- like --
like he would

12:19.990 --> 12:21.490
hunt me down and kill me.

12:21.590 --> 12:23.460
He's totally crazy.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.130
My God, like,
totally **** out there.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.230
After meeting with Kim,
I started talking

12:31.330 --> 12:34.640
to other employees and customers
of the Pine Street Saloon...

12:34.740 --> 12:36.500
I witnessed,

12:36.610 --> 12:38.510
for the first time
in my life,

12:38.610 --> 12:40.470
a full apparition.

12:40.580 --> 12:42.580
I even verbalized
to my friends,

12:42.680 --> 12:44.810
"Are my eyes deceiving me
right now?"

12:44.910 --> 12:46.810
...and everyone --
and I mean <i> everyone,</i>

12:46.920 --> 12:48.280
had experiences to share.

12:48.380 --> 12:49.880
All right.
So, you heard footsteps.

12:49.990 --> 12:51.290
What else is going on?

12:51.390 --> 12:53.050
Objects, you know,
being thrown.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.760
That's a little strange.

12:54.860 --> 12:57.120
Once I noticed
the activity here,

12:57.230 --> 13:01.100
things started happening
at my own home as well.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.730
With all the stories
I'm hearing,

13:02.830 --> 13:04.630
I'm surprised
Ron's still in business.

13:04.730 --> 13:06.870
The mirror up there
just, like, psh.

13:06.970 --> 13:08.240
Like, if I would've been
sitting there,

13:08.340 --> 13:09.670
my face would've
been cut up.

13:09.770 --> 13:11.540
And I went, "What the hell?"

13:11.640 --> 13:13.410
One night,
I was sitting on the bed

13:13.510 --> 13:15.840
when I looked up and seen
somebody goin' into the room.

13:15.950 --> 13:17.180
So what you saw
was an apparition?

13:17.280 --> 13:19.380
Yes. He -- he was
a little creepy, you know?

13:19.480 --> 13:21.050
I even looked away,
and when I looked back,

13:21.150 --> 13:23.220
he was still looking at me.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.520
There's something here.

13:24.620 --> 13:27.190
There's definitely --
There's something here.

13:30.160 --> 13:36.260
I feel like the man
knows everything.

13:36.370 --> 13:39.700
He can, like, hurt you

13:39.800 --> 13:42.640
and, like, control you,

13:42.740 --> 13:45.970
and you can't escape from him.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.310
You can't hide.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.610
Like, he just owns you.

13:51.350 --> 13:54.320
He can mess with your mind.

13:54.420 --> 13:56.780
You feel like you need to run,
you need to get out of here.

13:58.790 --> 14:00.890
You would feel frightened.

14:00.990 --> 14:05.060
You would feel panicked,
scared.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.830
He's gonna find you
and he's gonna get you.

14:07.930 --> 14:12.570
He can manipulate them
and brainwash them.

14:14.740 --> 14:17.240
People would have
nervous breakdowns.

14:17.340 --> 14:19.640
They would be very sick.

14:19.740 --> 14:24.140
They would have a lot
of physical attacks on them.

14:27.780 --> 14:29.780
Living don't stand
a chance here.

14:29.890 --> 14:32.320
Just, they don't
**** stand a chance.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.430
So the minute
I get to a location,

14:47.540 --> 14:50.640
I reach out to journalists,
local cops, genealogists,

14:50.740 --> 14:53.210
anybody that can help me
with my case.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.180
I just got a call back
from a local reporter

14:55.280 --> 14:57.240
who says the original owner
of the property

14:57.350 --> 15:00.710
has a story so colorful
it should be made into a movie.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.660
So, Peggy, I appreciate
you helping me with this.

15:09.760 --> 15:10.820
But let me ask you.

15:10.930 --> 15:12.090
Why'd you bring me
all the way up here?

15:12.190 --> 15:14.560
Well, this is a winery now,
but this property

15:14.660 --> 15:17.200
was actually owned originally
by the Blackburns

15:17.300 --> 15:19.070
that had the property
that you are investigating.

15:19.170 --> 15:22.040
It was two brothers,
James and Daniel.

15:22.140 --> 15:24.770
When did they get here, and how
much property did they have?

15:24.870 --> 15:29.280
1857, they bought 26,000 acres
of what became Paso Robles.

15:29.380 --> 15:31.250
And they split it evenly
between the two of them,

15:31.350 --> 15:33.350
13,000 acres each.

15:33.450 --> 15:35.850
Daniel went ahead
and took the portion

15:35.950 --> 15:39.120
that actually is now
the, um, Pine Street Saloon.

15:39.220 --> 15:40.790
Okay. So what do we know
about him?

15:40.890 --> 15:43.290
Daniel was kind of
the dominant brother.

15:43.390 --> 15:47.130
He was a very ambitious man
and he was a clever man.

15:47.230 --> 15:48.460
And to protect his property,

15:48.560 --> 15:51.070
he had himself
appointed sheriff.

15:51.170 --> 15:54.770
He actually even had a vigilante
group that he directed.

15:54.870 --> 15:58.110
They had 200 deputies
that were charged primarily

15:58.210 --> 16:02.380
with removing Native Americans
and Mexicans from the property.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.710
And very sadly,

16:03.810 --> 16:06.750
a lot of people were killed
by this vigilante group.

16:06.850 --> 16:08.120
Now, Peggy, you said
this guy Daniel had

16:08.220 --> 16:09.550
a pretty rough time with things
while he was here.

16:09.650 --> 16:11.390
Yes, he did. He --

16:11.490 --> 16:13.950
he had married a woman
named Cecelia Dunn,

16:14.060 --> 16:16.460
and this is her later
in life, of course.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.090
And they had three children.

16:18.190 --> 16:19.960
And in 1871,

16:20.060 --> 16:22.230
she was in a carriage
with the three children,

16:22.330 --> 16:24.500
and something spooked
the horse,

16:24.600 --> 16:26.800
and, their
1- year-old daughter Jenny

16:26.900 --> 16:29.340
was thrown out
of the carriage.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.870
A soapbox flew out
of the carriage

16:31.970 --> 16:33.540
and struck her in the head...

16:33.640 --> 16:35.140
and it killed her instantly.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.510
- This was a 1-year-old?
- Yes.

16:36.610 --> 16:38.380
That's pretty tragic,
especially the way it happened.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.550
Yes.

16:39.650 --> 16:40.710
All right, so, Peggy,
when did they get around

16:40.820 --> 16:42.120
to building the saloon
I'm investigating?

16:42.220 --> 16:45.050
They built it approximately
in the mid-1880s.

16:45.150 --> 16:46.850
So what happened after that?

16:46.960 --> 16:48.590
Around the mid-1890s,

16:48.690 --> 16:50.960
Daniel Blackburn's health
started to fail,

16:51.060 --> 16:54.800
and he passed away in 1901.

16:54.900 --> 16:56.000
Even in his death,

16:56.100 --> 16:58.430
there were legal problems
over the property.

16:58.530 --> 17:01.140
- And what happened?
- Daniel's widow, Cecelia,

17:01.240 --> 17:02.640
had been left
all the property,

17:02.740 --> 17:05.569
but he didn't leave anything
to the two sons.

17:05.670 --> 17:07.339
And, within a year or so,

17:07.440 --> 17:10.940
the two sons turned around
and sued their own mother.

17:11.050 --> 17:12.480
Now according
to this article,

17:12.579 --> 17:15.720
Daniel Blackburn actually was
mentally incompetent.

17:15.819 --> 17:17.050
That's what the court found.

17:17.150 --> 17:19.550
They did win the lawsuit,

17:19.660 --> 17:22.619
and that was the end
of the saga of the Blackburns.

17:28.300 --> 17:31.470
The creepy guy
is really dangerous.

17:31.570 --> 17:34.940
Like, he feels, like, ownership.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.670
I was seeing...

17:36.770 --> 17:41.510
something actually
about a horse accident,

17:41.610 --> 17:44.650
and it killed the rider.

17:44.750 --> 17:50.350
I feel like this man
was a killer.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.320
There's victims around him.

17:56.430 --> 17:58.660
There's victims.
Like, I feel like --

17:58.760 --> 18:01.560
like this man is,
like, unhinged.

18:01.660 --> 18:06.400
He can hurt you and, like,
control you.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.570
It's so scary.

18:10.670 --> 18:13.440
There's something
about a code of silence.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.880
You can't hide.
You can't escape from him.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.580
Like, he just owns you.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.390
So Ron mentioned
the upstairs area of this hotel

18:30.490 --> 18:31.960
used to be a brothel.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.130
Turns out it's true.

18:34.230 --> 18:36.130
I'm on my way to meet
with a local crime writer

18:36.230 --> 18:39.300
who says the conditions
were absolutely horrible.

18:46.110 --> 18:47.740
So, Skye, thanks for
helping me out with the case.

18:47.840 --> 18:48.940
I appreciate that.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.440
We can assume then
that Ron's right

18:50.550 --> 18:53.280
and upstairs might've been
a boarding house or a brothel.

18:53.380 --> 18:56.020
Yes. It was kind of
widely known, um,

18:56.120 --> 18:58.150
that a lot of the bars had
these sort of operations

18:58.250 --> 18:59.320
that were happening upstairs.

18:59.420 --> 19:01.090
Um, they were called
boarding houses.

19:01.190 --> 19:03.360
That was the code word,
the kind of cover word.

19:03.460 --> 19:06.190
They would operate above bars
like Pine Street.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.700
Okay, so when would this
have been going on?

19:08.800 --> 19:11.330
It started in, like,
the late 1800s,

19:11.430 --> 19:13.070
and then into
the 21st century.

19:13.170 --> 19:16.200
There was a real boom,
with the prostitution trade,

19:16.310 --> 19:17.540
around World War I

19:17.640 --> 19:20.670
because there was a large influx
of military personnel.

19:20.780 --> 19:22.510
Now I did a lot of cases
with these brothels,

19:22.610 --> 19:24.180
and I know the conditions
were horrible.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.610
Did that happen here?

19:25.710 --> 19:29.080
The conditions were terrible,
a lot of drugs and drinking.

19:29.190 --> 19:31.290
And a lot of times,
they would abuse the women,

19:31.390 --> 19:32.420
beat the women.

19:32.520 --> 19:34.620
Then, of course,
it was not sanitary.

19:34.720 --> 19:37.390
They didn't have access
to good medical care,

19:37.490 --> 19:40.160
so a lot of times,
these women would get pregnant

19:40.260 --> 19:43.230
and have to get
black market abortions.

19:47.100 --> 19:50.070
There's these people,
they seem young.

19:50.170 --> 19:53.170
Like, I'm just seeing,
like, people on drugs,

19:53.280 --> 19:56.110
strung out, partying.

19:58.380 --> 20:01.280
Drugs, drugs, drugs. Okay.
I feel like I'm on drugs.

20:03.890 --> 20:06.290
There's also, like,
a lot of sex going on,

20:06.390 --> 20:07.920
like, a lot of sex.

20:08.020 --> 20:11.120
It's, like, so thick and bad.

20:11.230 --> 20:13.860
It's so bad.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.630
They're bad people.

20:16.730 --> 20:18.130
I don't like it.

20:18.230 --> 20:20.100
I don't know how anybody
could, like, for 1 minute,

20:20.200 --> 20:21.670
be up here and be okay.

20:23.510 --> 20:24.640
All right, so these girls

20:24.740 --> 20:26.010
that had to get
these illegal abortions,

20:26.110 --> 20:27.670
was there a doctor
in town they went to?

20:27.780 --> 20:29.880
Well, actually,
there was a gentleman named,

20:29.980 --> 20:32.710
Christian Thomas
who was a bartender

20:32.820 --> 20:36.980
who moonlighted as,
an illegal abortionist.

20:37.090 --> 20:38.150
What?

20:38.250 --> 20:40.220
So I actually have a photo
of Thomas.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.760
That's him there.

20:41.860 --> 20:44.760
He actually worked in a place
called Lyle's Cocktail Lounge

20:44.860 --> 20:46.930
about 300 yards away
from Pine Street.

20:47.030 --> 20:49.660
All right. So where'd this guy
do these abortions?

20:49.770 --> 20:52.330
He would bring his clients
back to his apartment,

20:52.430 --> 20:53.870
which was
right around the corner.

20:53.970 --> 20:55.670
We actually have
a picture of it as well.

20:55.770 --> 20:58.510
So that was the room where
he would do the procedures.

20:58.610 --> 21:00.640
So this is where
these poor girls were going.

21:00.740 --> 21:02.540
Do we have any idea
how many he performed?

21:02.650 --> 21:03.910
He admitted to 12.

21:04.010 --> 21:07.350
Okay, you said he admitted
to doing 12 abortions.

21:07.450 --> 21:09.780
So what happened?
Did he get caught?

21:09.890 --> 21:12.250
In, -
So September 1, 1953,

21:12.350 --> 21:16.390
he had a client, um,
that he botched the procedure,

21:16.490 --> 21:17.720
and she ended up dying.

21:17.830 --> 21:20.160
Okay. So what do we know
about the victim?

21:20.260 --> 21:21.660
Her name was
Virginia Grider.

21:21.760 --> 21:24.460
This is a picture of her.
She was 30 years old.

21:24.570 --> 21:26.330
She was actually
from San Francisco.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.100
Does he go to jail?
What's the story?

21:28.200 --> 21:29.870
Thomas was arrested,

21:29.970 --> 21:32.740
and later found guilty
of second degree murder.

21:35.580 --> 21:37.280
She's still out here.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.680
Who?

21:38.780 --> 21:40.350
The shadow woman.

21:40.450 --> 21:42.580
No one helped her.

21:42.690 --> 21:48.020
She feels like she was, like,
a younger person when she died.

21:48.120 --> 21:51.760
But she's from the '20s or '30s.

21:51.860 --> 21:55.130
And I did keep seeing a knife,

21:55.230 --> 21:57.700
so I don't know
if she was stabbed by a knife.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.830
She says, "I was not a whore,"

21:59.940 --> 22:01.870
but I think she was murdered.

22:01.970 --> 22:04.240
Very disturbing.

22:09.350 --> 22:10.740
If you need us to investigate

22:10.850 --> 22:12.650
unexplained activity
in your home,

22:12.750 --> 22:15.520
go to the "Dead Files" page
at travelchannel.com.

22:15.620 --> 22:17.350
Click on "Help me, Dead Files!"
to submit your story,

22:17.450 --> 22:18.620
and we'll help if we can.

22:26.230 --> 22:29.130
So far I know Ron's bar
was home to a brothel,

22:29.230 --> 22:31.570
and his property used to be
owned by a ruthless sheriff

22:31.670 --> 22:34.970
who was behind several
vigilante murders.

22:35.070 --> 22:37.200
But I need to see
if there's anything more.

22:38.610 --> 22:40.210
Searching through old records,

22:40.310 --> 22:42.680
I find a man
named William Crawford.

22:42.780 --> 22:44.640
Turns out, he was found dead

22:44.750 --> 22:46.810
right outside
the Pine Street Saloon.

22:49.020 --> 22:50.750
I'm on my way
to meet with a local lieutenant

22:50.850 --> 22:53.390
who says this case
was truly bizarre.

22:58.730 --> 23:01.130
So what can you tell me
about William Crawford's case?

23:01.230 --> 23:04.870
July 4, 1947,
he was dead on the doorstep,

23:04.970 --> 23:08.700
on the back porch actually,
of -- of the hotel.

23:08.800 --> 23:09.700
What were the circumstances?

23:09.810 --> 23:12.070
Mr. Crawford was
a 60-year-old ranch hand

23:12.170 --> 23:13.910
that was living
in an upstairs room,

23:14.010 --> 23:15.680
and he'd been drinking
all night long.

23:15.780 --> 23:17.510
So he was found
by some of the dishwashers

23:17.610 --> 23:20.180
that were working at the hotel
the next morning.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.480
They thought
he was passed out,

23:21.580 --> 23:23.480
so they called the police
to come and investigate.

23:23.590 --> 23:25.090
- Okay.
- So when they got there,

23:25.190 --> 23:27.620
what they found was
that he was actually dead.

23:27.720 --> 23:29.960
He died from an injury
to the back of his head.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.830
All right, so what do we think
happened with this guy?

23:31.930 --> 23:33.690
So we think he got
locked out of his room.

23:33.800 --> 23:38.570
He was drunk the night before,
ended up on the back porch,

23:38.670 --> 23:39.900
tried to climb up,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.340
probably slipped off the ladder,
and injured himself.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.740
They ultimately did the,
the coroner's investigation

23:45.840 --> 23:47.870
that he had a,
fractured skull

23:47.980 --> 23:49.240
on the back of his head,

23:49.340 --> 23:50.980
and he died of
a brain hemorrhage.

24:03.690 --> 24:06.130
Ew.

24:06.230 --> 24:07.590
Like, some guy,

24:07.700 --> 24:11.000
like, rolling around
on the floor crawls up to me.

24:11.100 --> 24:14.030
He thinks he's still alive.

24:14.140 --> 24:15.770
Can you see who this is?

24:22.040 --> 24:23.710
Did this guy jump you?

24:23.810 --> 24:25.510
Yes...

24:28.150 --> 24:29.580
I can't even think straight,

24:29.690 --> 24:33.620
Like...so messed up my head.

24:34.860 --> 24:39.090
I feel like...
I feel very confused.

24:39.190 --> 24:41.730
I feel like I'm drunk.

24:41.830 --> 24:44.460
I have this weird...

24:44.570 --> 24:47.000
very weird taste in my mouth.

24:47.100 --> 24:48.540
My teeth hurt.

24:48.640 --> 24:51.710
Somebody broke their teeth.

24:51.810 --> 24:53.640
My head, my head.

24:53.740 --> 24:56.580
My neck hurts.
My neck hurts..

24:56.680 --> 24:58.610
I see, like, blood on my hands.

25:00.520 --> 25:04.820
I feel like I'm yelling
or screaming inside,

25:04.920 --> 25:07.220
and then there's blood
everywhere.

25:07.320 --> 25:09.220
Seems like he wants help.

25:14.260 --> 25:16.160
Is he making you move
like that?

25:16.270 --> 25:20.070
He can make you move,
like a doll.

25:20.170 --> 25:23.540
Do you know if this is something
he does to others?

25:23.640 --> 25:25.140
Yes.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.610
Is this something that could be
dangerous to the living?

25:27.710 --> 25:29.380
Yeah.

25:29.480 --> 25:32.250
Like, you could have, like,
a heart attack, I think.

25:33.620 --> 25:35.120
All right,
I gotta get out of here.

25:35.220 --> 25:36.520
Okay.

25:36.620 --> 25:39.620
Getting out of here.
I'm going now. I'm leaving.

25:46.760 --> 25:49.330
I saw several dead people
during my walk,

25:49.430 --> 25:51.400
but the shadow woman
who can jump people

25:51.500 --> 25:53.630
concerns me the most.

25:53.740 --> 25:59.510
She's spread out
over the entire...ceiling,

25:59.610 --> 26:02.680
but her face
is just a skull.

26:02.780 --> 26:06.110
Her arms are coming down,

26:06.210 --> 26:10.250
and they're coming
for my throat.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.290
Amy, is this what you saw?

26:17.390 --> 26:18.990
Yes.

26:38.310 --> 26:41.080
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:41.180 --> 26:42.480
we're ready
to reveal our findings

26:42.580 --> 26:46.050
to each other and our clients
for the first time.

26:46.150 --> 26:47.890
So, Amy,
I want you to meet Ron.

26:47.990 --> 26:50.060
He's owned this place
for the last 5 years.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.360
The activity is so bad here

26:51.460 --> 26:54.490
that he's having a hard time
keeping employees,

26:54.600 --> 26:56.000
Kim being one of 'em.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.230
She quit a few months ago

26:57.330 --> 26:58.830
because she thought she was
in danger.

27:00.370 --> 27:02.740
Ron doesn't even know if it's
safe for anybody to be here,

27:02.840 --> 27:05.540
but he's determined to keep
the doors open for one reason --

27:05.640 --> 27:06.710
his mom.

27:06.810 --> 27:08.710
She ran this place for 40 years,

27:08.810 --> 27:12.680
and Ron is not gonna let
the paranormal ruin her legacy.

27:12.780 --> 27:15.980
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's happening here,

27:16.080 --> 27:18.990
I'm gonna have her
describe her walk for us.

27:19.090 --> 27:23.660
There's three deceased
individuals here

27:23.760 --> 27:26.690
that I'm most concerned
about.

27:26.800 --> 27:30.630
The first individual
was a woman

27:30.730 --> 27:34.170
that I met
when I was out back.

27:34.270 --> 27:36.740
And the thing
that unsettled me about her

27:36.840 --> 27:40.810
was that she looks so much

27:40.910 --> 27:44.680
like a real shadow person.

27:44.780 --> 27:47.550
It was extremely unnerving
for me.

27:47.650 --> 27:50.250
And after she died,
she said to me

27:50.350 --> 27:51.920
that she didn't wanna see
anymore,

27:52.020 --> 27:55.220
so she actually
plucked her eyes out,

27:55.320 --> 27:58.220
and then her face
became a skull.

28:00.830 --> 28:04.430
I- I do feel like she could
be dangerous, um,

28:04.530 --> 28:06.230
to the living here.

28:06.330 --> 28:07.700
She goes after necks,

28:07.800 --> 28:10.540
like, grabbing people
and poking at their throats.

28:10.640 --> 28:12.140
She's very disturbed.

28:12.240 --> 28:15.210
She carries a-a knife
with her.

28:17.550 --> 28:20.080
I think she wants
to kill people with the knife.

28:22.820 --> 28:26.190
I had a experience with one
of my employees in my back bar.

28:26.290 --> 28:28.690
She was looking over this way,

28:28.790 --> 28:31.620
and the knife was
on the other side,

28:31.730 --> 28:34.160
and then it just went
off the shelf.

28:34.260 --> 28:37.400
And so she turns around
and looks and looks at it

28:37.500 --> 28:39.270
for about a minute
and just takes off running.

28:39.370 --> 28:41.330
- Wow.
- Yeah.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.600
Now Ron here is a skeptic...

28:43.710 --> 28:44.970
...because he doesn't have
many experiences

28:45.070 --> 28:46.840
except for the couple things
he's seen.

28:46.940 --> 28:49.780
But you got so many complaints
from customers and employees,

28:49.880 --> 28:52.850
you decided to put in cameras.

28:52.950 --> 28:54.950
I gotta show you something
that's pretty compelling.

28:55.050 --> 28:58.920
There's a backroom here
where they keep, um, stock.

28:59.020 --> 29:00.790
There's Ron.

29:04.490 --> 29:06.360
Wow.

29:06.460 --> 29:07.590
I thought maybe
with the weight, you know,

29:07.700 --> 29:09.000
top heavy
and all this other stuff,

29:09.100 --> 29:10.860
but it wasn't.

29:13.640 --> 29:16.100
My God.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.170
So is this woman responsible
for all the stuff

29:18.270 --> 29:19.670
that's moving around down here?

29:19.780 --> 29:21.040
Yes.

29:21.140 --> 29:23.640
So is it possible that
knife thing might've been her?

29:23.750 --> 29:26.010
Yeah.
I would think if...Yeah.

29:26.110 --> 29:29.580
I mean, she's all about
the knife, so...
Yeah.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.020
I did have a sketch
done of her,

29:33.120 --> 29:34.950
and it's from
the point of view of someone

29:35.060 --> 29:37.960
seeing her hanging
from the ceiling.

29:38.060 --> 29:39.160
What?

29:39.260 --> 29:41.330
Hold on a second.

29:47.540 --> 29:49.440
Wait till you see this.

29:49.540 --> 29:51.640
- Wow.
- Wow.

29:58.650 --> 30:00.050
Wow.

30:00.150 --> 30:01.750
Eyes are creepy.

30:01.850 --> 30:03.020
About 4, 5 years ago,

30:03.120 --> 30:05.690
rooms 2 and 3 had
two people in each room.

30:05.790 --> 30:07.050
I asked them how their stay was,

30:07.160 --> 30:08.420
and they said,
"Yeah, everything was great,

30:08.520 --> 30:10.820
except we saw this mannequin
hanging from the ceiling."

30:10.930 --> 30:13.190
****.

30:13.300 --> 30:14.930
- Can I flip this?
- You can flip that.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.630
It just creeps me out.

30:16.730 --> 30:19.000
Yeah.

30:19.100 --> 30:21.300
Any clue about her in life?

30:21.400 --> 30:25.070
I got that she died young.

30:25.170 --> 30:29.140
I think she died
in the '20s or '30s.

30:29.240 --> 30:31.340
I wasn't certain
if she killed herself

30:31.450 --> 30:33.380
or if she was murdered.

30:33.480 --> 30:34.910
But I saw her holding
a knife,

30:35.020 --> 30:37.580
so I think she might've
been killed with one.

30:37.690 --> 30:41.120
She kept saying
that she's not a whore,

30:41.220 --> 30:43.160
nobody cared about her,
nobody helped her,

30:43.260 --> 30:46.390
and that she's angry
and she wants revenge.

30:46.490 --> 30:47.690
So she's got a knife.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.030
She died young and she told you,
"I'm not a whore."

30:50.130 --> 30:51.200
Yeah.

30:51.300 --> 30:52.930
I mean, this could be
a long shot.

30:53.030 --> 30:56.240
There was a guy named
Christian "Tommy" Thomas,

30:56.340 --> 30:57.740
who was a bartender

30:57.840 --> 31:00.470
that performed illegal abortions
right here in town

31:00.580 --> 31:02.440
from the '30s to the '50s.

31:02.540 --> 31:04.310
Actually got a photo of him.
He's pretty...

31:06.150 --> 31:07.880
- God.
- Ew.

31:07.980 --> 31:10.050
- That's creepy.
- Really?

31:11.850 --> 31:14.220
Now I got a photo here
of his apartment

31:14.320 --> 31:16.820
where he actually did
these abortions.

31:16.930 --> 31:19.130
As you can see, it's the most
unsanitary-looking place

31:19.230 --> 31:22.260
you can find.
- My.

31:22.360 --> 31:25.230
Now, of course, abortions
were illegal back then,

31:25.330 --> 31:28.570
and he, um, was
the only game in town.

31:28.670 --> 31:32.140
On September 1, 1953,
a woman named Virginia Grider

31:32.240 --> 31:35.540
came to Paso Robles
looking for Thomas.

31:35.640 --> 31:36.680
This is her.

31:36.780 --> 31:38.080
She was from the Bay Area,

31:38.180 --> 31:40.450
and her husband drove her
down here to do it.

31:40.550 --> 31:43.450
But the abortion was botched...

31:43.550 --> 31:45.250
and she died.

31:45.350 --> 31:47.620
- Wow.
- Thomas was arrested.

31:47.720 --> 31:48.990
He plead guilty.

31:49.090 --> 31:53.290
He had a sentence of 5 years to
life, and he did 5 years.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.130
Sad.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.370
Okay, so what else?

32:02.470 --> 32:05.070
I ended up in the attic,

32:05.170 --> 32:09.380
and I had a very negative
experience up there with a male.

32:09.480 --> 32:11.310
I didn't even understand
what was happening,

32:11.410 --> 32:13.350
but he just got me good.

32:13.450 --> 32:18.520
He jumped me, which means
he literally went into my body.

32:18.620 --> 32:21.090
And I think that
he's extremely good at --

32:21.190 --> 32:23.860
at doing this,
which makes me nervous

32:23.960 --> 32:29.200
because I think that he could
affect living people.

32:29.300 --> 32:33.070
He can make you move,
like a doll.

32:36.300 --> 32:37.600
I can't even think straight.

32:37.710 --> 32:41.610
Like...so messed up my head.

32:44.080 --> 32:47.850
Somebody could have
a heart attack.

32:47.950 --> 32:50.450
Any idea who this guy
might've been that jumped you?

32:50.550 --> 32:51.620
What I was able to get

32:51.720 --> 32:54.890
was that he is stuck
in his death state,

32:54.990 --> 32:57.690
which might indicate

32:57.790 --> 33:01.190
that he died suddenly.

33:01.300 --> 33:03.200
I had incredible neck pain,

33:03.300 --> 33:06.000
and then my mouth,
my teeth,

33:06.100 --> 33:08.570
in particular,
felt very strange.

33:08.670 --> 33:11.070
I felt drunk, confused.

33:11.170 --> 33:12.510
There was blood everywhere,

33:12.610 --> 33:16.340
and I know
that he wants help.

33:16.440 --> 33:17.880
He wants out.

33:17.980 --> 33:21.210
Now listen, a lot of people
have come through this place,

33:21.320 --> 33:22.650
so it could be anybody.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.490
But when you talk
about somebody dying suddenly,

33:25.590 --> 33:28.550
teeth smashed in, drunk,
one person comes to mind.

33:28.660 --> 33:30.860
Um, on July 4th, 1947,

33:30.960 --> 33:32.660
there was
a 60-year-old farm hand

33:32.760 --> 33:36.100
by the name of William Crawford
that was staying upstairs.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.770
He was drinking at the bar.
He was hammered.

33:38.870 --> 33:41.170
According to witnesses, left,

33:41.270 --> 33:42.740
tries to get into his room,
he's locked out.

33:42.840 --> 33:45.470
And at that time, there was
a ladder that went upstairs.

33:45.570 --> 33:48.270
They surmised that he fell
trying to get into his room.

33:48.380 --> 33:50.710
He had a fractured skull,
teeth caved in,

33:50.810 --> 33:52.410
the whole nine yards.

33:52.510 --> 33:54.850
Now does this sound
like the guy who jumped you?

33:54.950 --> 33:56.950
- Yeah. I know it was him.
- Okay.

34:01.390 --> 34:02.690
All right, what else?

34:02.790 --> 34:07.790
Okay, so...
on the second floor,

34:07.900 --> 34:10.400
the residual energy up there
was so strong,

34:10.500 --> 34:12.800
it was physically
making me sick.

34:12.900 --> 34:14.100
Wow.

34:14.199 --> 34:17.270
And I don't think that
living people would be able

34:17.370 --> 34:21.670
to stay up there for very long
and feel comfortable.

34:21.780 --> 34:23.280
I was seeing,

34:23.380 --> 34:26.080
people, like, dancing,
singing, drinking,

34:26.179 --> 34:27.409
doing drugs,

34:27.520 --> 34:29.679
some people
being strung out.

34:29.780 --> 34:33.389
Um, I saw a lot of,
sex happening.

34:36.560 --> 34:37.719
Well, when I spoke with Ron,

34:37.830 --> 34:39.830
he said that there might've
been a bordello

34:39.929 --> 34:41.360
or a brothel upstairs.

34:41.460 --> 34:43.260
So I checked it out,
and you were right.

34:43.360 --> 34:44.429
- Really?
- Really?

34:44.530 --> 34:46.030
- Yeah.
- It was a bordello?

34:46.130 --> 34:49.969
From the 1800s all the way
up into the 1920s and '30s.

34:50.070 --> 34:51.739
Girls were working here
and exposed to drugs,

34:51.840 --> 34:53.070
alcohol, and violence.

34:53.170 --> 34:54.340
- Right.
- You know...

34:54.440 --> 34:55.980
Wow.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.510
So the thing about
the second floor

34:58.610 --> 35:03.820
was that I encountered
a male.

35:03.920 --> 35:06.450
And then I felt, like,
this deep sadness,

35:06.550 --> 35:09.420
and I felt that he was
experiencing a lot of loss.

35:09.520 --> 35:12.660
And this upset him greatly.

35:12.760 --> 35:18.100
I was seeing something actually
about a horse accident,

35:18.200 --> 35:20.770
and it killed the rider.

35:20.870 --> 35:21.930
I absolutely think

35:22.040 --> 35:24.740
that this individual is
completely insane.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.410
I felt that he had
killed people,

35:27.510 --> 35:30.580
and/or had individuals
do this for him.

35:30.680 --> 35:32.280
The thing about
this place

35:32.380 --> 35:34.880
is that he feels
a sense of ownership.

35:34.980 --> 35:36.920
Like, anywhere
this person's ever been,

35:37.020 --> 35:40.390
he feels like he owns
that space and time.

35:40.490 --> 35:42.820
So the guy says he feels
ownership of the place,

35:42.920 --> 35:44.360
killed people,
and had mental problems.

35:44.460 --> 35:45.560
Yeah.

35:45.660 --> 35:49.300
Okay, there is somebody
that it could be.

35:49.400 --> 35:50.860
Now his name
was Daniel Blackburn.

35:50.970 --> 35:52.130
I got a photo of him.

35:52.230 --> 35:56.440
Um...this is him right here.

35:56.540 --> 35:59.010
Wow.

35:59.110 --> 36:01.910
His eyes are
kind of creepy.

36:02.010 --> 36:04.280
Now Daniel was
a wealthy investor

36:04.380 --> 36:06.080
who owned 26,000 acres
of land here,

36:06.180 --> 36:07.810
including your property.

36:07.920 --> 36:11.050
You said the guy either killed
people or had them killed.

36:11.150 --> 36:13.190
So when he came into town,

36:13.290 --> 36:16.620
he formed a vigilante group
of about 200 men,

36:16.720 --> 36:19.790
and he basically got rid
of all the Mexicans

36:19.890 --> 36:21.230
and all the Native Americans
that were here...

36:21.330 --> 36:22.500
And displaced them.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.230
More than likely,
he just killed a lot of them.

36:24.330 --> 36:25.360
Wow.

36:25.470 --> 36:27.670
And you said he was upset
about a loss.

36:27.770 --> 36:30.570
Blackburn's wife was
in a horse and carriage

36:30.670 --> 36:33.370
with their 1-year-old
when the baby was

36:33.470 --> 36:36.780
tossed out from the horse,
getting spooked,

36:36.880 --> 36:38.780
and the baby died.

36:38.880 --> 36:41.050
Now you said
he was mentally unwell.

36:41.150 --> 36:43.450
Check out this article.
It's pretty interesting.

36:45.650 --> 36:46.890
After his death,

36:46.990 --> 36:49.520
courts decided that Blackburn
was mentally incompetent

36:49.620 --> 36:50.790
at the end of his life,

36:50.890 --> 36:54.790
and, he wasn't of sound mind
to make a will.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.200
Now you're the only one that
got a look at him.

36:56.300 --> 36:57.900
What do you think?

36:58.000 --> 37:00.900
I'm not sure
if it's him or not.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.370
The only thing is --
is the eyes.

37:03.470 --> 37:05.570
Like, the eyes,

37:05.670 --> 37:10.310
'cause he had light eyes
and he had thick brows.

37:10.410 --> 37:13.880
His energy
was extremely terrifying.

37:13.980 --> 37:16.620
I got that he was
a telepath.

37:16.720 --> 37:19.150
Telepaths are able to,

37:19.250 --> 37:23.260
really
heavily influence people.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.760
You can't escape from him.

37:25.860 --> 37:28.230
You can't hide.

37:28.330 --> 37:30.300
He can mess with your mind.

37:30.400 --> 37:33.130
You feel like you need to run,
you need to get out of here.

37:33.230 --> 37:35.700
He's gonna find you
and he's gonna get you.

37:37.140 --> 37:40.810
You do feel a sense of panic
and anxiety upstairs,

37:40.910 --> 37:43.510
from all of
this negative energy.

37:43.610 --> 37:44.840
Everybody said
they had the feeling

37:44.950 --> 37:47.150
of being watched up there.
- Yes. Yes.

37:47.250 --> 37:51.420
There are some people
who will not return up there.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.750
A year, year and a half ago,

37:52.850 --> 37:54.750
I had a couple from out of town
that wanted to see

37:54.860 --> 37:56.590
the architecture
of the building upstairs.

37:56.690 --> 37:57.820
And when they came back,

37:57.930 --> 37:59.790
the next thing
the woman said was,

37:59.890 --> 38:02.430
"It grabbed my butt," and that's
all she could say was,

38:02.530 --> 38:04.100
"It grabbed my butt."

38:04.200 --> 38:06.570
And I actually have it on video.

38:06.670 --> 38:07.970
Wow.

38:08.070 --> 38:10.500
Let me show Amy
what we're talking about.

38:10.610 --> 38:11.800
So the husband's
just, like, you know,

38:11.910 --> 38:13.210
I'm going in first, take a look.

38:13.310 --> 38:14.270
He's not paying attention
to her.

38:14.380 --> 38:16.380
And all of a sudden, bam.

38:19.180 --> 38:21.650
- Wow.
- Yeah.

38:21.750 --> 38:25.080
My concern would be
being influenced

38:25.190 --> 38:27.290
over a long period of time.

38:27.390 --> 38:29.320
You could have
nervous breakdowns,

38:29.420 --> 38:31.090
get physically attacked.

38:31.190 --> 38:34.790
Eventually, people could
get killed here.

38:34.900 --> 38:36.700
Is there any place safe
in this building?

38:36.800 --> 38:39.970
No. No, not right now.

38:40.070 --> 38:42.770
Living don't stand a chance
here.

38:42.870 --> 38:46.570
There's something pretty much
in every nook and cranny.

38:46.670 --> 38:47.940
Wow.

38:48.040 --> 38:50.640
Wow is right.

38:50.750 --> 38:52.880
I didn't realize
there was that much going on.

38:52.980 --> 38:54.210
I mean, I...

38:54.320 --> 38:57.080
I love this bar.

38:57.190 --> 38:59.620
There's something special
about this place

38:59.720 --> 39:02.590
and everybody here.

39:02.690 --> 39:05.390
I put my heart and soul
in this place, and -- and...

39:05.490 --> 39:08.590
the...
****

39:27.180 --> 39:28.510
So, Ron,
I know you were adamant

39:28.620 --> 39:30.380
about keeping the doors open
to honor your mom

39:30.490 --> 39:32.990
and all the hard work
she put into this place,

39:33.090 --> 39:36.160
but after hearing what Amy said
about what's going on here,

39:36.260 --> 39:38.360
you're lucky
nobody's gotten hurt.

39:38.460 --> 39:41.490
But I know you wanna fight this,
so I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

39:41.600 --> 39:44.730
to see if there's any way
you can make this place safe.

39:46.770 --> 39:50.370
Let me start with the male
up in the attic, Mr. Crawford.

39:50.470 --> 39:51.840
He wants help.

39:51.940 --> 39:55.410
He wants help,
so you need a medium

39:55.510 --> 39:59.750
who is going to move
Mr. Crawford on.

39:59.850 --> 40:03.080
The female...Okay,
so I wanna give her a chance.

40:03.180 --> 40:04.750
I wanna give her
a fair shot.

40:04.850 --> 40:08.520
So on another day,
you have a female medium come,

40:08.620 --> 40:13.390
work some issues out,
and then move on.

40:13.490 --> 40:15.490
If she doesn't go,

40:15.600 --> 40:18.860
then I want you to contact
a demonologist.

40:21.870 --> 40:24.470
And what the demonologist
will do

40:24.570 --> 40:27.910
is basically do
an exorcism.

40:28.010 --> 40:29.810
Wow.

40:29.910 --> 40:33.650
Also, you need
a Reiki master.

40:33.750 --> 40:35.880
This is
very, very important.

40:35.980 --> 40:39.750
This person would come
two times per month

40:39.850 --> 40:41.690
for 6 months...
- Whoa.

40:41.790 --> 40:45.120
...to remove
all of the residual energy

40:45.230 --> 40:48.060
that has collected upstairs.

40:48.160 --> 40:51.330
And that's...
Yeah, that's a beast.

40:51.430 --> 40:52.870
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

40:52.970 --> 40:54.900
So if the Reiki master comes in

40:55.000 --> 40:58.040
and is able to get rid
of all that residual stuff...
Yes.

40:58.140 --> 41:00.970
...the creepy guy
will go along with it.
Yes.

41:01.080 --> 41:02.070
Yes.

41:02.180 --> 41:04.380
It'll be <i> very</i> quiet here.

41:07.420 --> 41:08.450
Yeah.
- Sorry.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.380
No, it's okay.

41:10.490 --> 41:11.880
You gotta be relieved.

41:11.990 --> 41:14.220
Yes. Yes.

41:14.320 --> 41:15.990
You gonna take Amy's advice?

41:16.090 --> 41:18.890
- Yeah.
- Whatever it takes. Yes.

41:18.990 --> 41:20.230
If they can
clear things up here,

41:20.330 --> 41:22.730
would you come back to work?
- Yes.

41:22.830 --> 41:24.460
I do it because I love it.

41:24.570 --> 41:27.500
It's an honor to work here

41:27.600 --> 41:29.540
and to serve
the people in here.

41:32.070 --> 41:33.540
Ron has a lot of work to do
if he wants

41:33.640 --> 41:36.680
to keep his employees and guests
out of harm's way,

41:36.780 --> 41:39.480
but with the help of a medium
and a Reiki master,

41:39.580 --> 41:40.910
the dead will move on,

41:41.020 --> 41:43.320
and Ron will be able to keep
this restaurant in his family

41:43.420 --> 41:46.050
for generations to come.
