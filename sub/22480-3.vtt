all the major organs.

34:20.695 --> 34:22.216
Pin a medal on Mac.

34:25.362 --> 34:26.443
Either...

34:28.616 --> 34:30.956
...he meant to do the least
amount of damage possible...

34:33.391 --> 34:36.239
...or you just got lucky.
It's up to you, Sergeant.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.875
Hey, how about you just shut up
and give me something for the pain?

34:45.577 --> 34:49.538
- Ma'am.
- Lowry knows we're closing in on her.

34:49.539 --> 34:51.397
We run the risk of her
going ghost and disappearing.

34:51.398 --> 34:54.422
Well, I would assume that McAllister is
intent on stopping that from happening.

34:54.422 --> 34:59.120
So I hear. It is a great shot.

34:59.121 --> 35:00.613
Yeah. Thanks.

35:02.342 --> 35:03.750
You did the right thing.

35:03.751 --> 35:06.203
Ultra have contacts right
across the city... police,

35:06.204 --> 35:09.480
government departments... possibly
why Jane is using them to find

35:09.481 --> 35:12.200
her target and when they do,
we need McAllister on hand

35:12.212 --> 35:13.588
to grab the target first.

35:13.589 --> 35:17.669
Except like you said, Lowry is on
to us and Rosa is suspicious as hell.

35:18.874 --> 35:20.604
Ma'am, it is a matter of
time before they work out

35:20.605 --> 35:22.731
that Mac is dirty and when they do,

35:22.732 --> 35:25.812
this will be nothing compared
to what they do to him.

35:44.689 --> 35:47.471
Magyar Ultra and Mac mobile. Following.

36:13.113 --> 36:16.012
Looks like we're crossing the
river to the first district.

36:16.013 --> 36:17.178
Copy.

36:17.179 --> 36:20.709
Remember Magyar Ultra need
to find Ilias Zarin for us.

36:22.006 --> 36:25.181
We cannot let Lowry have her man.

36:25.182 --> 36:28.480
Whoever he is, he's bad news.

36:58.608 --> 37:01.329
- Mac just went in.
- If they move, you need to be on them.

37:01.330 --> 37:03.610
- Wyatt and I will get eyes inside.
- Copy.

37:04.027 --> 37:06.222
- Real covert, cowboy.
- Tsk.

Target's in vehicle making a break
for it. Mac, Rosa, Josef following.

40:43.501 --> 40:47.257

You're going to shoot me?

something off about him.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.789
