00:15.370 --> 00:17.420
He's waking up. He's coming to.

00:23.910 --> 00:25.390
We need to talk.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.890
How the hell did he survive Ruskov's ship?

00:29.890 --> 00:31.740
He managed to grab a life raft.

00:31.750 --> 00:33.130
Washed up on the Florida coast,

00:33.130 --> 00:35.390
where a group of American survivors took him in.

00:35.390 --> 00:38.500
I don't suppose he told them that he was contagious.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.230
No.

00:39.690 --> 00:42.510
After that, he moved from camp to camp, taking what he needed.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.180
It was either fate or bad luck that led him to the immunes.

00:45.180 --> 00:48.290
And the labs? Did he lead the Ramseys to Dr. Hunter?

00:48.370 --> 00:49.470
He wouldn't say.

00:49.810 --> 00:51.070
At least, not to me.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.550
So what are you gonna do with him?

00:53.550 --> 00:54.990
I haven't decided yet.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.300
And he only made one request.

00:57.590 --> 00:58.970
He wants to speak to you.

00:58.970 --> 01:00.530
No. It's not gonna happen.

01:00.530 --> 01:02.360
You said you were having trouble nebulizing the vaccine.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.030
- Absolutely not. - ‭He started it.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.360
The primordial started it.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.370
He perpetuated it, weaponized it.

01:07.370 --> 01:08.880
I have his blood samples.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.390
Once I see what happens to the rats,

01:10.400 --> 01:12.330
I'll be able to find the stability sequence he used

01:12.330 --> 01:13.890
to bind his D.N.A. to the virus.

01:13.890 --> 01:16.720
That will be the sum total of his usefulness.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.070
You said that can take months.

01:18.070 --> 01:21.100
- Captain -- - He killed my wife,

01:22.190 --> 01:24.110
and I was able to talk to him.

01:25.580 --> 01:27.810
So unless you have a better idea...

01:35.720 --> 01:37.260
I know he's a snake,

01:37.660 --> 01:41.290
but if he can help, you have to talk to him.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.160
Come in.

02:23.290 --> 02:24.460
Mr. President.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.850
How are you feeling this morning?

02:28.410 --> 02:30.600
I better get my sea legs soon.

02:31.430 --> 02:32.810
You ready to meet the crew?

02:35.300 --> 02:37.130
And what exactly is expected of me?

02:37.140 --> 02:40.390
Am I to make battle decisions?

02:40.770 --> 02:42.540
You'll be consulted on relevant matters,

02:42.540 --> 02:44.260
anything that falls under the executive branch

02:44.260 --> 02:46.550
or anything pertaining to national security --

02:46.590 --> 02:49.610
which, given the circumstances, that's just about everything.

02:54.610 --> 02:56.770
He's not ready -- not yet, at least.

02:56.930 --> 02:59.410
He's come a long way in a short time, sir.

02:59.410 --> 03:01.400
And I want you to get him the rest of the way there.

03:01.600 --> 03:02.730
Be his guide, his preacher,

03:02.730 --> 03:03.480
his father, his friend --

03:03.480 --> 03:05.380
- whatever he needs. - ‭Aye, sir.

03:08.310 --> 03:10.870
Kathy, do you think I could borrow some condensed milk?

03:10.870 --> 03:13.370
Sounds like you're making cheesecake again.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.280
...at, uh, 30 degrees...

03:16.280 --> 03:19.140
Hey, y'all. Does anybody have extra diapers?

03:19.140 --> 03:20.890
I can't believe how normal it all sounds,

03:20.890 --> 03:23.060
like a functioning community.

03:23.590 --> 03:25.730
Sounds like the president's intel's good.

03:25.950 --> 03:27.800
New Orleans may be the safe place to go.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.390
And there's been no word about an immune army gathering.

03:30.390 --> 03:31.980
Nothing about immunes at all.

03:31.980 --> 03:32.910
Well, if they think we're listening,

03:32.910 --> 03:34.800
they might be communicating another way.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.420
Bullet missed all my major organs.

03:39.420 --> 03:42.490
Perhaps I have nine lives. Like a cat, no?

03:43.280 --> 03:44.630
More like a cockroach.

03:57.550 --> 03:58.970
Dr. Scott.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.600
- You wanted to see me. - ‭Yes.

04:03.700 --> 04:06.980
Well, I mean, it seems congratulations are in order.

04:08.090 --> 04:09.310
You found a cure.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.280
Well, I'd be lying if I said that it was easy. ‭

04:12.520 --> 04:13.350
Well...

04:15.640 --> 04:18.870
And strictly scientifically speaking,

04:18.930 --> 04:21.329
I found your work to be rather impressive,

04:21.329 --> 04:25.050
the way you fused your D.N.A. to the virus.

04:25.050 --> 04:26.390
If nothing else...

04:28.670 --> 04:30.000
It was elegant.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.630
Thank you.

04:32.380 --> 04:34.340
It was never my intention to spread it.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.930
It's important you know that.

04:38.710 --> 04:42.570
Niels, I've been working on this idea of nebulizing the cure,

04:42.570 --> 04:44.950
and I'm having a little bit of trouble,

04:45.240 --> 04:49.620
so I was just wondering if you'd be at all curious to...

04:50.920 --> 04:52.870
take a look at my research.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.740
So you wanna hear about the life of a gun for hire.

05:00.740 --> 05:03.540
Yeah. Capping oil wells in Kuwait.

05:03.790 --> 05:05.920
Babysitting third-world princes.

05:05.970 --> 05:08.170
Wow. I mean, you even have a worst?

05:08.170 --> 05:10.820
Oh, he was at Gitmo for 18 months.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.420
‭Yeah, I got my stories and the scars to prove it.

05:14.460 --> 05:15.330
Ah. Give me some of that.

05:15.330 --> 05:17.420
I'd show you, but there's a lady present.

05:17.780 --> 05:18.580
Big talker.

05:18.580 --> 05:20.670
All right, sweetheart, what's the worst you ever seen?

05:20.710 --> 05:21.910
You call me "Sweetheart" again,

05:21.910 --> 05:24.480
I'll make you eat that pathetic pair of 9s you're holding.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.320
You'll never know.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.380
Hang on.

05:28.540 --> 05:30.790
Answer his question. Worst story ever.

05:32.940 --> 05:35.710
What makes one war worse than another?

05:36.220 --> 05:37.600
Death is death.

05:39.190 --> 05:40.370
Bet you're a riot at parties.

05:40.370 --> 05:42.150
Oh, don't even get her started.

05:42.540 --> 05:43.430
Raise you 5.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.690
Okay. We raise.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.250
What do you think, Burk?

05:49.170 --> 05:50.690
Do I have the goods?

05:54.910 --> 05:56.850
And what am I looking at here?

05:56.880 --> 06:01.020
This is the vaccine compound before nebulization,

06:01.490 --> 06:05.620
and here it is after it's been sprayed into the air.

06:05.620 --> 06:07.120
Yeah, it falls apart.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.370
Have you tried reducing the particle size?

06:09.620 --> 06:10.720
I've considered it,

06:10.720 --> 06:13.080
but then it wouldn't be heavy enough to drop into the lungs.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.080
And you're sure the physics are sound?

06:16.080 --> 06:18.430
Dr. Hunter worked it out.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.130
Julius hunter.

06:21.780 --> 06:23.780
You must have heard of him, from Palm Coast.

06:23.930 --> 06:27.290
Um, only by, uh, reputation.

06:29.610 --> 06:32.460
I've thought about adding an extra component

06:32.470 --> 06:35.900
to the outer coat to prevent the vaccine from drying out.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.580
Yeah, it would need to be...

06:37.690 --> 06:39.550
particularly resilient.

06:39.730 --> 06:40.820
Precisely.

06:41.330 --> 06:42.950
Well, what about anthrax, you know?

06:42.950 --> 06:46.510
It's strong enough to survive for decades in any environment.

06:46.510 --> 06:50.270
One epidemic at a time, Niels.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.530
Right, right. Probably best.

06:52.710 --> 06:55.360
What we need is an environment

06:55.480 --> 06:58.160
that's been untouched by the pandemic

06:58.170 --> 06:59.590
and yet severe enough

06:59.590 --> 07:02.780
to promote adaptive activity in bacteria.

07:04.370 --> 07:05.490
How about water?

07:07.600 --> 07:09.440
That's just what I was thinking.

07:13.340 --> 07:14.580
Mussels?

07:14.980 --> 07:18.330
Freshwater mussels, to be exact.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.980
Mussels carry bacteria,

07:20.980 --> 07:23.090
and in order to survive harsh environments,

07:23.090 --> 07:24.470
the bacteria adapts.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.660
To do this, it protects itself

07:26.660 --> 07:29.700
with a sort of intracellular suspended-animation chamber

07:29.700 --> 07:30.410
called spores.

07:30.420 --> 07:33.400
Now if I could get my hands on some of those spores,

07:33.410 --> 07:35.770
I could add their proteins to the outer coat of the cure,

07:35.770 --> 07:37.540
making it hardy enough to survive

07:37.540 --> 07:39.530
the nebulization process.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.010
This is Niels' bright idea, right?

07:41.010 --> 07:41.930
No, it's mine, actually.

07:41.930 --> 07:45.860
I led him to it, and he... he played ball.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.670
So we find you a bunch of mussels,

07:48.670 --> 07:51.200
and you'll be able to aerosolize the cure?

07:51.200 --> 07:54.930
Not quite. I still need Niels' stability sequence.

07:54.930 --> 07:57.100
- Which he hasn't given you. - I haven't asked him yet.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.170
And if he doesn't give it up?

07:58.170 --> 07:59.790
Well, then I'll have to do it the slow way,

07:59.790 --> 08:02.780
by which time millions more people will be dead.

08:02.780 --> 08:06.710
But for right now, I really need those mussels.

08:11.180 --> 08:13.290
So where exactly do we find them?

08:24.270 --> 08:26.070
The closest freshwater lake is here, sir.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.940
St. Andrew bay, about a mile inland.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.530
Good. We'll get the mussels and be back by sundown.

08:30.660 --> 08:32.549
I want this ship close to shore,

08:32.789 --> 08:35.200
somewhere the sub can't and won't dare go.

08:35.500 --> 08:38.190
O.O.D., recommend course 3-4-7.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.919
Very well. Helm, right...

08:39.929 --> 08:41.030
T.A.O., bridge.

08:42.120 --> 08:42.780
‭T.A.O.

08:42.780 --> 08:44.650
I want the all-clear for our landing party.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.040
Anything on subsurface search?

08:46.050 --> 08:47.230
Negative, sir. All's quiet.

08:47.230 --> 08:48.180
We can support the landing party

08:48.190 --> 08:50.060
with the .50 cals and the 25-mike-mike.

08:50.110 --> 08:52.550
- CIWS is in air ready. ‭- Very well.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.730
Attention on deck!

09:09.990 --> 09:10.890
At ease.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.780
This is the finest messdecks afloat.

09:14.780 --> 09:17.200
If you can dream it up, our chefs can whip it up.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.360
Mr. President.

09:18.710 --> 09:21.790
Bernie Cowley, culinary specialist second class.

09:21.870 --> 09:23.950
I'm happy to prepare anything for you.

09:24.270 --> 09:26.510
Gosh, um, I don't know.

09:27.420 --> 09:28.520
What did you have for lunch?

09:28.520 --> 09:30.760
Oh, you don't want my diet, Mr. President.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.000
Nothing but grilled vegetables as of yet.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.040
But for you, name it.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.580
Well, uh, let me see.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.230
I got prime rib, chicken cordon bleu.

09:42.590 --> 09:45.440
Well, it, uh, it all sounds so -- so very good.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.110
I just...I don't know where to start.

09:47.110 --> 09:49.440
Mr. President. Sorry to interrupt.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.520
Uh, Lieutenant Mejia, ship's navigator.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.010
We're honored to have you aboard, sir.

09:53.150 --> 09:55.180
Just wanted to tell you I'll do whatever I can

09:55.180 --> 09:56.940
to make this ride as smooth as possible.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.760
Actually just came down here to say hello to everyone.

10:08.770 --> 10:11.100
I-I think we have to get to that briefing now, don't we?

10:12.270 --> 10:13.200
Yes, sir.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.010
I'm walking around a ship full of 20-year-olds

10:37.010 --> 10:39.150
who know exactly what they're doing at all times,

10:39.260 --> 10:41.840
on a mission to save a country that's barely recognizable.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.480
And me, Mr. President,

10:43.630 --> 10:45.600
I can't figure out what to eat for lunch.

10:46.900 --> 10:49.990
Sir, how many people did you have working under you

10:49.990 --> 10:51.650
when you were secretary of H.U.D?

10:51.940 --> 10:54.050
I know where this is going, Master Chief,

10:54.400 --> 10:56.440
but the last time I made a decision...

10:56.440 --> 10:59.430
The last time you made a decision was yesterday, sir,

11:00.090 --> 11:01.940
when you decided to move forward.

11:02.910 --> 11:04.210
And I'll tell you this --

11:04.340 --> 11:07.970
the Navy's been studying leadership since 1775.

11:07.970 --> 11:09.600
Between the Captain, the X.O., and myself,

11:09.600 --> 11:11.740
we have 67 years' experience.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.910
Leaders aren't born. They're made.

11:14.020 --> 11:15.960
And we all believe in you, sir.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.940
Just give yourself time.

11:28.120 --> 11:31.100
I'd like to have a plan as to how

11:31.100 --> 11:35.410
we'll engineer the spore protein into the vaccine

11:35.410 --> 11:37.050
once the mussels arrive.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.380
I was thinking perhaps a stabilizer,

11:39.460 --> 11:40.950
very much like the one that you used

11:40.950 --> 11:43.150
to bind your D.N.A. to the virus.

11:43.150 --> 11:45.860
Ah. The real reason I'm here.

11:46.370 --> 11:49.440
You know that viruses don't like to be tinkered with.

11:49.470 --> 11:52.370
They'll loop out any added foreign genes,

11:52.370 --> 11:53.520
and somehow, Niels,

11:53.520 --> 11:56.720
you managed to sidestep the recombination process.

11:56.730 --> 11:59.740
Yeah, well, it was so long ago, you know,

11:59.740 --> 12:01.740
and I tried so many.

12:02.530 --> 12:04.850
I mean, honestly, Rachel,

12:04.850 --> 12:06.800
who can remember these things?

12:07.280 --> 12:09.020
You know that I took samples of your blood

12:09.020 --> 12:10.320
while you were recovering.

12:10.340 --> 12:11.620
You're not really gonna make me

12:11.620 --> 12:14.120
truffle this out myself, are you?

12:16.080 --> 12:17.490
Someone special?

12:29.210 --> 12:30.690
No, not particularly.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.340
It's an old computer.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.100
Never got around to changing the screen saver --

12:34.100 --> 12:36.170
He is a handsome fellow, no?

12:37.650 --> 12:40.120
So what I'm mostly interested is the chiralit--

12:40.120 --> 12:42.190
Doesn't really seem like your type, though.

12:42.190 --> 12:45.180
Not much going on upstairs.

12:45.330 --> 12:48.630
I suspect that you tired of him quickly.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.320
You see, I remember this about you.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.450
Dr. Rachel Scott --

12:54.940 --> 12:58.280
always the smartest person in the room,

12:58.720 --> 13:03.240
The unstoppable force in search of her immovable object.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.650
Am I right?

13:21.820 --> 13:23.530
All right, perimeter sweep first.

13:23.530 --> 13:24.830
Check for survivors.

13:24.980 --> 13:26.010
Once the Marina's secure,

13:26.010 --> 13:28.250
we look for keys to something with wheels.

13:39.540 --> 13:40.620
We got a runner!

14:06.240 --> 14:07.940
United States Navy!

14:08.310 --> 14:10.200
Come on out! I'm not gonna hurt you!

14:24.050 --> 14:25.790
It's okay. You're okay.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.250
You can take off your mask. I'm not sick.

14:33.760 --> 14:34.730
Neither are we.

14:41.610 --> 14:43.840
Hey. Easy.

14:44.220 --> 14:45.470
All right, easy.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.280
Nobody has to die today.

14:48.330 --> 14:51.140
That's right. You're worth more alive than dead, anyway.

14:57.260 --> 14:58.320
Hold your fire!

14:59.360 --> 15:02.300
- Don't be stupid, kid. - Ray! What do we do now?

15:05.460 --> 15:06.150
Ray.

15:06.940 --> 15:07.980
Put the guns down.

15:08.620 --> 15:09.450
Ray!

15:11.340 --> 15:12.630
Lower your weapons.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.450
Come on. Back against the wall.

15:21.620 --> 15:22.740
We're not gonna hurt you.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.570
What did you mean when you said

15:25.570 --> 15:27.220
we're worth more alive than dead?

15:34.530 --> 15:35.790
Wolf and Cruz went to the lake

15:35.790 --> 15:37.140
to gather the mussels for Dr. Scott.

15:37.140 --> 15:38.410
They should be back soon.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.600
And they won't tell you who set the bounty?

15:40.600 --> 15:43.420
No, sir. It's gotta be the immunes, right?

15:51.140 --> 15:52.700
I understand you're the man.

15:56.780 --> 15:57.470
Tom Chandler,

15:57.470 --> 15:59.580
captain, U.S.S. Nathan james.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.610
Ray Diaz. Sophomore.

16:07.060 --> 16:07.890
What's this?

16:08.060 --> 16:09.690
It's what leaders give each other.

16:09.790 --> 16:13.450
You find yourself in a Navy bar, and of legal age,

16:14.100 --> 16:15.540
that'll earn you a free drink.

16:17.020 --> 16:19.600
There's no Navy, no law, and no bars.

16:19.650 --> 16:22.770
Other than that, this will really come in handy.

16:25.270 --> 16:26.390
Cut 'em loose.

16:29.700 --> 16:31.590
Let's you and I have a talk.

16:53.210 --> 16:54.310
These are good.

16:55.570 --> 16:56.400
You mind?

17:00.590 --> 17:02.740
My son's a huge comic book fan --

17:02.740 --> 17:04.450
goes to conventions, whole nine yards.

17:04.450 --> 17:05.359
Not anymore.

17:11.540 --> 17:12.839
So what's his story?

17:14.369 --> 17:15.569
During the outbreak,

17:16.510 --> 17:19.190
he crashes his car trying to save a town from the virus.

17:19.609 --> 17:22.020
Wakes up, realizes he has superpowers,

17:22.030 --> 17:24.030
but can't remember who he is.

17:25.220 --> 17:27.760
He uses his powers to help stranded people get home,

17:28.950 --> 17:30.790
even though he can't go home himself.

17:39.690 --> 17:40.950
And where are your parents?

17:41.550 --> 17:42.730
Dead, we assume.

17:43.080 --> 17:46.340
We were at the summer camp up the coast when the virus hit.

17:48.630 --> 17:50.750
One by one, counselors bolted,

17:50.760 --> 17:52.450
trying to get to their own families.

17:52.450 --> 17:53.910
We stayed until we ran out of food,

17:53.910 --> 17:55.770
and no one ever came for us.

17:57.150 --> 17:58.950
And the bounty on my people?

18:02.940 --> 18:05.170
A few days ago, these dudes in trucks showed up.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.460
- Were they American? - Yeah, of course.

18:07.590 --> 18:08.650
They said, uh,

18:09.220 --> 18:11.760
the Navy was going around offering the cure,

18:12.630 --> 18:14.860
and really they were injecting people with the virus.

18:15.430 --> 18:17.410
- You believed 'em? - Didn't surprise me.

18:17.410 --> 18:19.420
There's all kinds of conspiracies going around --

18:20.150 --> 18:22.390
that the government was behind the plague in the first place.

18:22.410 --> 18:24.000
Anyways, it doesn't matter what I believe.

18:24.010 --> 18:25.610
- They were offering food. - ‭And guns.

18:25.610 --> 18:28.200
Look, man, nothing against you and your people,

18:28.330 --> 18:29.470
but I got mouths to feed.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.760
Well, there is no conspiracy,

18:32.010 --> 18:33.520
and we do have the cure.

18:34.710 --> 18:37.840
Matter of fact, we have enough doses for every one of you.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.440
What I need from you

18:40.100 --> 18:42.330
is help finding these bounty hunters.

18:42.810 --> 18:43.620
If the cure is real,

18:43.620 --> 18:45.220
then what do these people have against you?

18:45.220 --> 18:48.220
They're a cult, naturally immune to the virus.

18:48.220 --> 18:52.460
They see the cure as a threat to their beliefs.

18:52.780 --> 18:54.240
If you help us,

18:54.240 --> 18:55.950
we'll bring you aboard our ship,

18:56.860 --> 18:58.790
find you a safer place to settle.

19:07.390 --> 19:08.960
I mean, how do we know if we can trust these guys?

19:08.960 --> 19:09.870
What else are we gonna do?

19:09.870 --> 19:10.650
Come on.

19:13.950 --> 19:16.070
Permission to speak freely, Captain?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.510
I don't like putting these kids in the middle of our fight.

19:22.510 --> 19:24.810
They're already in the middle of it, Lieutenant.

19:24.810 --> 19:26.380
Immunes saw to that.

19:26.390 --> 19:28.680
Rest assured they'll be on the ship and out of harm's way

19:28.680 --> 19:31.320
- as soon as possible. - What about reprisals?

19:31.320 --> 19:33.080
We don't know how far the immunes have spread.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.890
Dropping them somewhere else now could be just as dangerous.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.210
We have the mussels, Captain.

19:39.690 --> 19:40.270
We should leave now

19:40.270 --> 19:42.710
before the immunes ever find out we were here.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.420
We're over 300 miles away from their camp in Florida,

19:45.420 --> 19:47.140
and yet somehow their reach stretches here.

19:47.140 --> 19:49.210
We have to find out how they're doing this.

19:52.110 --> 19:54.130
It's a deal. You give us food and shelter,

19:54.130 --> 19:55.680
we'll give you the bounty hunters.

19:57.730 --> 19:58.470
Good.

19:58.710 --> 19:59.930
Only one condition.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.020
I stay and fight with you.

20:03.590 --> 20:04.830
Absolutely not.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.040
In six months,

20:06.120 --> 20:08.370
I'll be old enough to enlist and fight alongside you.

20:08.370 --> 20:10.000
Besides, you can't do this without me.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Nobody knows this place better than I do.

20:12.270 --> 20:13.240
And you still need me to tell you how

20:13.240 --> 20:14.500
to signal the bounty hunters.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.650
Give me the lay of the land.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.760
How can she work with that creature?

20:42.440 --> 20:43.550
I can't even look at him

20:43.550 --> 20:45.910
without seeing my brother dead in my arms.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.180
I'm just praying he does something stupid

20:48.470 --> 20:49.890
so I can shoot him.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.340
So this is the spore sequence right here.

20:52.630 --> 20:55.480
Fascinating, isn't it? The way it's regulated.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.320
This bacteria -- when it needs to turn into a spore,

20:58.320 --> 21:00.060
it uses D.N.A. scissors.

21:00.060 --> 21:01.380
D.N.A. scissors.

21:01.380 --> 21:04.060
Yeah, I've heard of this. This is like a crispr system.

21:04.060 --> 21:05.080
Exactly.

21:05.080 --> 21:05.870
So we'll use this

21:05.870 --> 21:08.130
to add the spore protein into the vaccine.

21:08.130 --> 21:11.440
Of course, we'll still need something to hold it in place.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.860
I don't remember the stability sequence.

21:14.870 --> 21:15.370
I don't.

21:15.370 --> 21:18.120
I told you, I wish I did. I don't.

21:26.870 --> 21:27.850
‭Come in.

21:31.370 --> 21:32.670
You wanted to see me, sir?

21:32.810 --> 21:34.920
I understand the mission on land is going well.

21:35.550 --> 21:37.820
I may drop by the combat center to watch for myself,

21:37.820 --> 21:39.300
If, uh, that's all right.

21:39.300 --> 21:41.170
Of course, Mr. President.

21:43.850 --> 21:45.130
Anything else, sir?

21:46.070 --> 21:47.690
The intel you found at the white house --

21:47.690 --> 21:49.020
I'd like you to bring it to me,

21:49.020 --> 21:51.310
along with any debriefs related to the immunes.

21:53.490 --> 21:55.710
Absolutely, Mr. President.

22:22.370 --> 22:23.430
All yours.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.140
That's the only road in.

22:34.010 --> 22:36.240
There's a perch right there you can scout from.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.040
You'll see them long before they see you.

22:39.940 --> 22:42.490
Look, these guys are packing some major firepower.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.010
They had guns I didn't know existed,

22:44.010 --> 22:45.250
and I play a lot of video games.

22:45.250 --> 22:46.530
Well, we don't have to worry about that.

22:46.540 --> 22:48.970
We're bringing a navy ship to a gunfight.

22:50.580 --> 22:52.820
We need intel, which means we'll need prisoners.

22:52.820 --> 22:54.030
Copy that.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.760
Hey, Tex, have you ever killed anyone?

23:13.920 --> 23:14.960
Yeah, I have.

23:15.610 --> 23:16.880
Cool.

23:17.790 --> 23:18.960
No, it isn't, squirt.

23:21.320 --> 23:22.020
Ask him, Jake.

23:22.020 --> 23:23.190
Yeah, I got it, cody.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.500
Hey, uh, we were wondering,

23:26.890 --> 23:29.650
maybe you could ask the captain if he'd let us stay and fight.

23:30.310 --> 23:31.430
He said yes to Ray.

23:35.140 --> 23:36.200
Not a chance.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.830
Scat teams are manned and ready, sir.

23:47.830 --> 23:49.650
- CIWS? - ‭Set to auto-fire on.

23:49.650 --> 23:50.630
What's the status of the RHIBs?

23:50.630 --> 23:53.020
Loading PAX now and will notify when inbound.

23:53.330 --> 23:54.560
Music to my ears.

23:55.250 --> 23:56.280
Watch your step.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.050
- Be careful. - I got the rest of us loaded up on the other boat.

23:59.050 --> 24:00.980
All right, thanks, Jake. Everybody's accounted for.

24:00.980 --> 24:03.050
- Good to go. ‭- Good job.

24:06.350 --> 24:07.450
Let's go.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.120
It's been three whole days.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.810
Niels' blood's been coursing through their veins.

24:22.810 --> 24:24.160
How the hell are they still alive?

24:24.160 --> 24:26.180
The virus has to be somewhere in his body.

24:26.180 --> 24:28.390
He was using it to poison those teddy bears.

24:28.780 --> 24:30.690
The virus must have adjusted inside of him,

24:31.300 --> 24:33.960
migrated exclusively to his lungs.

24:33.960 --> 24:36.530
That's why he's so contagious.

24:36.550 --> 24:38.280
Probably happened months ago, at the beginning.

24:38.280 --> 24:39.830
Then it's hiding out in there,

24:39.950 --> 24:41.390
below the radar of his immune system,

24:41.400 --> 24:43.210
along with his stability sequence.

24:43.210 --> 24:44.960
Which he may not even remember.

24:44.960 --> 24:48.220
Oh, he remembers. It's his shining bloody achievement.

25:00.850 --> 25:02.050
How are you feeling?

25:02.100 --> 25:04.930
Uh, your doctor here thinks I need rest,

25:04.930 --> 25:08.210
But, uh, I'm actually anxious to get back to work.

25:09.910 --> 25:11.140
Can we have a moment?

25:16.440 --> 25:19.930
I've identified the conserved core sequence

25:19.930 --> 25:21.340
in your stabilizers.

25:22.250 --> 25:23.250
You have?

25:23.250 --> 25:25.470
I recognized the same 20-base pair

25:25.470 --> 25:26.930
on both sides of the virus.

25:26.930 --> 25:29.550
The odds of that happening in nature, as we both know,

25:29.550 --> 25:31.950
are next to impossible.

25:31.990 --> 25:36.080
So, I took that as your brilliant handiwork.

25:37.990 --> 25:41.750
Well, you've eliminated a few trillion possible combinations.

25:46.650 --> 25:48.750
Can I ask you something?

25:49.730 --> 25:50.720
Yeah.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.100
I just think about what you went through,

25:56.030 --> 25:58.360
working to find the cure

25:58.360 --> 26:00.680
and fighting your own infection

26:00.680 --> 26:04.360
and the self-imposed quarantine on the Vyerni,

26:04.590 --> 26:07.800
literally isolated, with no human contact,

26:07.800 --> 26:09.390
in this bubble, and...

26:12.550 --> 26:14.550
I guess what I'm asking is...

26:17.890 --> 26:19.260
Do you ever get lonely?

26:21.030 --> 26:22.260
Yeah.

26:24.310 --> 26:26.780
God, I know my situation isn't nearly as difficult,

26:26.780 --> 26:27.850
but...

26:29.520 --> 26:31.410
There are sometimes on this ship --

26:34.140 --> 26:36.780
well, no one who understands me and this...

26:37.170 --> 26:38.830
unsolvable puzzle.

26:40.130 --> 26:41.380
and now, being...

26:44.120 --> 26:46.600
so close to the very mind that created it.

26:56.620 --> 26:57.830
Perhaps you were right.

27:00.170 --> 27:03.500
Perhaps my immovable object is closer than I thought.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.130
It's the three-prime end.

27:16.780 --> 27:18.390
Pardon?

27:18.960 --> 27:22.120
The, um, conserved core element you found,

27:22.120 --> 27:24.690
it's the very end of the stabilizer sequence.

27:25.320 --> 27:28.170
You just go upstream from there,

27:28.170 --> 27:30.200
and the entire sequence is yours.

28:04.790 --> 28:05.990
Status report.

28:06.950 --> 28:07.890
Green's good to go.

28:07.890 --> 28:09.540
Hired gun ready and waiting.

28:09.540 --> 28:11.280
- Taylor - Rock and roll.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.520
Burk and Bivas, good to go.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.610
CIC standing by to support, sir.

28:16.630 --> 28:17.630
All right, Ray.

28:18.150 --> 28:19.070
This is it.

28:19.630 --> 28:22.130
So how are you supposed to signal the bounty hunters?

28:30.930 --> 28:32.730
- What the hell are you doing?! - Come on, I hand this to you,

28:32.740 --> 28:33.960
I'm on the next ride back to your ship

28:33.970 --> 28:35.230
and you start the party without me.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.660
You can't bench me now.

28:37.740 --> 28:38.800
Watch me!

28:42.090 --> 28:43.850
Now, I don't plan to lose this fight,

28:43.850 --> 28:45.760
but this door opens, and it ain't me,

28:45.860 --> 28:47.630
tell those assholes you shot the flare

28:47.630 --> 28:49.290
and try to collect the bounty.

28:49.290 --> 28:50.850
Bad move, Ray.

28:55.260 --> 28:56.560
Hey! Come on!

29:03.570 --> 29:05.680
All teams be aware, Ray is still on land.

29:05.690 --> 29:08.180
I say again, Ray is still on land.

29:08.200 --> 29:09.670
He's locked in the trailer.

29:22.980 --> 29:24.780
Guests of honor are arriving.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.000
Come on, kids.

29:52.070 --> 29:53.130
Hey, where's Cody?

29:55.240 --> 29:56.490
He wanted to stay and fight.

29:56.910 --> 29:58.560
And you let him? You let him?!

30:00.160 --> 30:01.890
Captain, Cody wasn't on the RHIBs.

30:01.890 --> 30:04.120
- Jake covered for him. - I'm Oscar Mike.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.510
Gotta go find Cody.

30:18.790 --> 30:21.350
Captain is out of pocket. Keep an eye out.

30:21.370 --> 30:24.210
Can we get a fix on them? Can we triangulate?

30:24.980 --> 30:25.990
‭Cody!

30:28.610 --> 30:31.450
Burk, I read two tangos falling back up the road.

30:32.260 --> 30:34.010
We'll try to capture them alive!

30:36.200 --> 30:37.210
Cody!

30:38.280 --> 30:40.960
25 mike-mike has hostiles in range.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.920
Batteries release mount 2-5-2.

30:43.100 --> 30:45.200
T.A.O., prepare mount 5-1 for fire support.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.160
Aye, sir.

30:46.610 --> 30:48.020
Cody!

30:59.150 --> 31:00.490
Clear to move, Captain.

31:02.290 --> 31:04.260
- Tangos captured. - Copy that.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.340
Guys, I'm taking heavy gunfire up here.

31:08.340 --> 31:10.480
Hostiles are 20 yards north of my whiskey.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.310
Give me a fire-control solution and engage.

31:12.310 --> 31:14.740
Cobra team, stand by for one round inbound.

31:35.140 --> 31:36.320
Can't find Cody anywhere.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.250
Look in the cannery. That's his go-to spot.

31:38.250 --> 31:39.430
Surface, T.A.O.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.820
Adjust 10 yards east. Fire one round.

31:57.600 --> 31:58.570
Cody?

32:30.730 --> 32:31.600
Gotcha.

32:32.090 --> 32:33.790
Bosses want you alive...

32:34.600 --> 32:36.140
unless you put up a fight.

32:37.090 --> 32:38.060
Please?

32:38.750 --> 32:40.000
Put up a fight.

33:09.960 --> 33:11.490
Tangos neutralized.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.640
We have prisoners as requested.

33:14.780 --> 33:17.570
Repeat, tango is neutralized.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.590
Find what you were looking for?

33:59.320 --> 34:00.370
The mussels.

34:00.500 --> 34:03.190
Oh, y-yes. They were a tremendous help.

34:03.570 --> 34:04.440
Thank you.

34:05.070 --> 34:07.090
And I'm sorry to hear about the boy.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.679
And what about Niels?

34:09.739 --> 34:12.520
I think we're on the verge of a real breakthrough.

34:14.679 --> 34:17.310
Well, then don't let me slow you down.

34:22.150 --> 34:24.730
Can't blame the Captain for what happened to Cody.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.520
I can't blame anyone. That's the point.

34:27.560 --> 34:28.750
- Hey. - ‭What?

34:28.920 --> 34:30.000
What do you want from me?

34:33.630 --> 34:34.409
Nothing.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.100
Never mind.

34:37.639 --> 34:38.380
Okay.

34:45.020 --> 34:47.260
I was stationed in the west bank for three years,

34:47.290 --> 34:48.650
another two in Gaza.

34:50.590 --> 34:53.020
Thought I'd seen everything.

34:55.139 --> 34:57.260
Then this pandemic broke out.

34:59.430 --> 35:00.330
And I thought,

35:00.330 --> 35:03.620
you know, maybe now we have this common enemy.

35:04.970 --> 35:08.890
We even have this cure that we want to give to people.

35:09.860 --> 35:13.790
Maybe, just maybe, we'll stop killing each other.

35:16.540 --> 35:18.100
But nothing's changed.

35:21.330 --> 35:22.440
It's all the same.

35:30.150 --> 35:32.030
We captured three immunes.

35:32.350 --> 35:33.980
They were all carrying these.

35:37.870 --> 35:39.800
You ever see any of Ramsey's people use one?

35:39.800 --> 35:41.680
I didn't realize cell towers were up and running.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.130
They're not, Mr. President.

35:43.130 --> 35:45.000
We haven't picked up a signal in months,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.960
and none of these phones have a single call or text.

35:48.140 --> 35:50.540
But they were charged. They're using them somehow.

35:50.540 --> 35:53.530
You said they were trying to set up a communication network.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.710
- This must be it. - Our techs are on it.

35:56.900 --> 35:58.470
Meantime, we're gonna lean on our prisoners,

35:58.470 --> 36:00.180
see what else we can get out of 'em.

36:02.090 --> 36:03.350
This is good work.

36:05.320 --> 36:08.240
But if we're gonna win this war, we need a plan.

36:09.490 --> 36:10.940
First order of business --

36:10.940 --> 36:13.870
show our fellow Americans that we aren't the bad guys,

36:13.870 --> 36:16.270
despite the lies that Sean Ramsey's spreading.

36:16.450 --> 36:19.500
Once in New Orleans, we inoculate the survivors.

36:19.500 --> 36:22.510
We make it clear that the American government is back

36:22.620 --> 36:24.160
and that we're on their side.

36:27.030 --> 36:30.620
The survivors most likely are living offshore on boats.

36:30.660 --> 36:32.380
We need an evacuation plan

36:32.460 --> 36:34.140
in case the Ramseys are closing in.

36:35.170 --> 36:38.040
By now, those boats may have exhausted their fuel supplies,

36:38.650 --> 36:41.870
so I suggest that we stockpile fuel from local stations...

36:57.820 --> 37:01.130
We got some intel on a safe zone not far from here.

37:04.350 --> 37:07.110
Could be a good place for you and your people to resettle.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.190
Helo's warming up.

37:10.970 --> 37:12.390
I was gonna check it out.

37:14.510 --> 37:15.800
Wanna take a ride?

37:23.740 --> 37:26.140
I knew Cody was amped up to join the fight.

37:26.420 --> 37:27.640
He never would have stayed behind

37:27.640 --> 37:29.420
if I'd gone along like you said.

37:33.450 --> 37:34.900
There's an old saying.

37:37.780 --> 37:40.570
"Anyone can hold the helm when the sea is calm."

37:43.380 --> 37:46.130
Being a leader is not about being perfect.

37:47.740 --> 37:52.030
It's about weathering the storm and carrying on.

38:02.600 --> 38:03.820
I just wanna go home.

38:05.610 --> 38:06.760
I know, son.

38:11.010 --> 38:12.100
We all do.

38:15.420 --> 38:16.310
Feel better?

38:17.170 --> 38:18.180
Yes. Thank you.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.450
My arm was really bruising.

38:21.130 --> 38:23.160
You know, there was much times on the Vyerni

38:23.170 --> 38:26.370
when I thought about a moment like this.

38:27.910 --> 38:32.040
- Did you? - Well, I must admit, we're quite a team, you and I.

38:32.040 --> 38:35.120
A team with cause for celebration.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.180
We solved our nebulizing problem.

38:37.290 --> 38:38.720
Yes. Well, I mean,

38:38.720 --> 38:41.450
we still need to find a factory somewhere

38:41.450 --> 38:43.490
we can mass-produce the powder.

38:43.510 --> 38:45.440
And we need planes, lots of planes.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.800
You know, I always wanted to get my pilot's license.

38:47.800 --> 38:50.610
Actually, we don't have need for any of that --

38:50.950 --> 38:52.140
No planes,

38:52.670 --> 38:54.010
no factories,

38:54.240 --> 38:55.560
no powder even.

38:55.800 --> 38:56.430
I don't understand.

38:56.430 --> 38:58.900
How do you want to spread the vaccine?

38:58.900 --> 39:00.490
Well, if you think about it,

39:00.490 --> 39:03.130
you were able to kill 5 billion people

39:03.130 --> 39:05.080
- simply by breathing. - I...

39:05.080 --> 39:08.080
So the key to transmission lies within you.

39:08.660 --> 39:13.160
If I could teach healthy lungs to hold and reproduce the cure

39:13.160 --> 39:16.430
the same way yours do with the virus, well, then I could...

39:16.430 --> 39:18.620
You could make the cure contagious.

39:18.860 --> 39:20.250
Of course, the trick would be understanding

39:20.250 --> 39:22.060
just how your body does it,

39:22.100 --> 39:24.650
to be able to compare the D.N.A. sequence change

39:24.650 --> 39:26.860
between yours and the primordial.

39:28.250 --> 39:29.730
You have my blood samples.

39:29.730 --> 39:30.720
I do. ‭

39:31.050 --> 39:33.160
The problem is, is the virus.

39:33.550 --> 39:36.940
It resides exclusively in your lungs, as we both know.

39:36.940 --> 39:38.700
That's the reason why it's so contagious.

39:38.700 --> 39:41.070
So, what do we do? You wanna to take a biopsy?

39:41.070 --> 39:43.040
No. No, no. No.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.650
See, that wouldn't work, because it's likely

39:44.650 --> 39:47.290
in the deepest recesses of your lungs,

39:47.490 --> 39:50.460
mixed in with thousands of other innocuous viruses,

39:50.460 --> 39:55.430
so what I'm gonna need to do is just flush out the poisonous one.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.430
Flush it out? How?

39:58.430 --> 40:01.140
Well, you remember those brilliant little D.N.A. scissors?

40:01.380 --> 40:04.160
Well, they're not only capable of adding a gene.

40:04.160 --> 40:05.440
They can also remove one.

40:05.440 --> 40:08.260
So I'm gonna undo what you did.

40:09.010 --> 40:10.730
I'm gonna separate your gene

40:11.020 --> 40:14.620
from the virus inside your body.

40:16.380 --> 40:18.150
I'm sorry, but that would never work.

40:18.150 --> 40:19.900
Well, yes, actually it will,

40:19.900 --> 40:22.850
if they have identical stability sequences on either side,

40:22.850 --> 40:23.920
and...

40:27.080 --> 40:28.410
you gave me yours.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.580
That would kill me.

40:32.930 --> 40:34.950
The gene would be liberated,

40:35.160 --> 40:37.310
and the virus would explode out of your lungs

40:37.310 --> 40:38.880
and into the rest of your body,

40:38.880 --> 40:39.900
and, well...

40:42.930 --> 40:44.870
there's just so much of it.

40:46.370 --> 40:48.960
If you think I would just allow you to --

40:48.960 --> 40:50.860
I mean, you are completely insane!

40:50.860 --> 40:52.430
I've already done it, Niels.

40:55.260 --> 40:57.350
The virus is doing its work as we speak.

41:10.420 --> 41:11.550
What's going on in there?

41:11.990 --> 41:15.250
The people on this ship will sleep better tonight,

41:15.250 --> 41:17.200
knowing that it died with you.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.330
Dr. Scott, are you all right?

41:18.330 --> 41:19.480
I helped you.

41:20.390 --> 41:21.330
Yes, you did.

41:25.300 --> 41:27.680
- Dr. Scott! - You're gonna help all of us.
