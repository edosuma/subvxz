WEBVTT

00:18.750 --> 00:20.625
You talked to the head of homicide?

00:22.291 --> 00:26.958
Yeah, they found another chestnut man
with Kristine's prints on it.

00:30.083 --> 00:31.125
It makes no sense.

00:31.708 --> 00:33.000
Why leave a chestnut--

00:33.083 --> 00:36.500
I don't know.
They say it's a weird form of harassment.

00:39.375 --> 00:40.708
How's Steen taking it all?

00:41.458 --> 00:43.500
We'll be okay. We make a great team.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.833
Let me know if you need to talk.

00:50.083 --> 00:50.916
I'm here.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.875
That's nice of you, Frederik. Thanks.

01:02.708 --> 01:09.458
SEARCH FOR KRISTINE HARTUNG ABANDONED

01:11.916 --> 01:13.375
WHERE WAS SHE TAKEN?

01:13.458 --> 01:16.208
COMING HOME FROM TENNIS
WHEN MURDERER STRUCK

01:34.875 --> 01:35.708
Hi, honey.

01:36.708 --> 01:37.541
Hi.

01:40.666 --> 01:41.875
Did you have a nice day?

01:43.208 --> 01:44.041
It was okay.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.333
Where's Dad? Did you not have dinner yet?

01:49.541 --> 01:52.541
No. He's been in his office all afternoon.

01:54.625 --> 01:57.291
It's probably
the new construction project.

01:57.375 --> 02:00.041
You're probably right.
He said not to come in.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.166
What's all this?

02:15.291 --> 02:17.291
I need to review everything again.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.208
What if Gustav came in and saw it?

02:25.875 --> 02:27.208
How would that affect him?

02:30.583 --> 02:32.583
I know you're still drinking.

02:32.666 --> 02:34.208
I've stopped drinking.

02:37.166 --> 02:38.500
You have to stop this too.

02:42.125 --> 02:43.041
For Gustav's sake.

02:44.375 --> 02:45.250
And ours.

02:47.416 --> 02:48.875
I can't hide how I'm feeling.

02:51.041 --> 02:51.875
Yes, you can.

02:52.791 --> 02:55.666
-I do it every day. You can do it too.
-But I won't.

02:56.416 --> 02:59.458
There are so many oddities.
The fingerprints are odd.

02:59.541 --> 03:01.083
-The--
-You didn't pick her up.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.875
-That's why.
-You didn't pick her up either.

03:06.458 --> 03:08.500
-Not even once.
-But you promised!

03:24.583 --> 03:25.416
Sorry.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.208
Sorry, honey.

03:30.666 --> 03:33.208
Just promise me you'll take it all down.

04:26.541 --> 04:30.166
THE CHESTNUT MAN

04:33.666 --> 04:35.458
Did they light the lanterns yet?

04:35.541 --> 04:38.875
<i>You bet. It looks like</i>
<i>a Chinese lantern festival.</i>

04:39.416 --> 04:40.583
<i>I wish you'd seen it.</i>

04:40.666 --> 04:42.333
-I know.
-<i>I'm sorry you missed it.</i>

04:43.708 --> 04:45.000
Is she there?

04:45.083 --> 04:48.250
<i>You know what? She's not really</i>
<i>in the mood to speak to you.</i>

04:49.750 --> 04:51.875
Okay, but would you tell her--

04:51.958 --> 04:54.750
<i>And she's asking to have her ears pierced.</i>

04:54.833 --> 04:58.458
-No, of course<i> </i>she can't.
-<i>I have to go, bye!</i>

05:02.708 --> 05:05.125
-We've reported him missing.
-Good.

05:05.791 --> 05:06.958
Could he be the murderer?

05:07.041 --> 05:10.375
No, he has an alibi for
when Anne Sejer-Lassen was killed, but…

05:12.250 --> 05:13.166
Follow me, please.

05:18.375 --> 05:21.791
We responded to an anonymous report
that the boy was being neglected.

05:21.875 --> 05:24.208
We found a hidden basement built by Hauge.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.750
We also found his laptop
and are accessing it now.

05:26.833 --> 05:27.666
Are you okay?

05:28.333 --> 05:29.291
I'm fine, thanks.

05:30.958 --> 05:33.625
The room and the hatch
to the room are soundproof.

05:35.208 --> 05:38.541
It's all built under the grate.
I've never seen anything like it.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.458
I sent samples of the fibers to the lab.

05:41.541 --> 05:44.375
We'll dust for prints
to see who's been down here.

05:45.166 --> 05:48.083
Thulin? I've accessed Hauge's laptop.

05:54.666 --> 05:57.125
The folders are named according to months.

06:13.083 --> 06:13.916
<i>Magnus?</i>

06:15.791 --> 06:16.916
<i>Magnus, are you ready?</i>

06:17.875 --> 06:19.500
<i>This'll be great fun, I promise.</i>

06:23.208 --> 06:25.375
<i>You don't want to upset Mom, right?</i>

06:27.041 --> 06:30.041
<i>Good boy. Let's take off your vest, okay?</i>

06:32.958 --> 06:34.791
<i>Yes. You're doing great.</i>

06:36.250 --> 06:37.333
<i>You're a good boy.</i>

06:38.041 --> 06:39.458
<i>A really good boy, Magnus.</i>

06:40.333 --> 06:41.416
<i>And you're beautiful.</i>

06:42.916 --> 06:44.041
<i>Magnus, I love you.</i>

07:12.958 --> 07:15.750
It makes you want to kill the stepdad.

07:15.833 --> 07:16.708
Not his mom.

07:18.750 --> 07:22.541
His mom found out something was wrong.
That's why she changed the locks.

07:26.750 --> 07:30.000
If someone anonymous reported it
and killed Laura Kjær

07:30.083 --> 07:32.125
because he believed her to be a bad mom…

07:35.750 --> 07:37.500
why then kill Anne Sejer-Lassen?

07:37.583 --> 07:40.625
Maybe the murderer believed her
to be a bad mom too.

07:41.791 --> 07:45.083
But why? She was packing
and getting ready to leave her husband.

07:56.250 --> 07:59.208
<i>The blood we found between the floorboards</i>
<i>at the Sejer-Lassens,</i>

07:59.291 --> 08:01.166
did it belong to the daughter?

08:01.250 --> 08:02.083
<i>Yes.</i>

08:02.166 --> 08:08.125
We also found the sister's blood
in the bathroom and conservatory.

08:08.208 --> 08:10.791
It's all in the report. Why?

08:10.875 --> 08:13.791
<i>I think the girls</i>
<i>are a little too accident-prone.</i>

08:14.458 --> 08:17.000
-No, I don't think--
<i>-Thanks, I've got to go.</i>

08:18.500 --> 08:21.333
We need the medical records
for the Sejer-Lassen girls.

08:27.750 --> 08:30.208
The hospital in Gentofte,
broken collarbone.

08:31.875 --> 08:32.833
Broken nose.

08:34.666 --> 08:36.708
Don't look at me. Look at the pictures.

08:38.083 --> 08:42.625
And here, the ER at the central hospital
in Copenhagen, when you lived there.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.500
Fell down the stairs.

08:46.250 --> 08:49.916
-It wasn't me. It was an accident.
-We know what you did to your kids.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.041
The question is, "Who else knew?"

08:56.666 --> 09:00.291
The Prosecution Service will charge you
with abusing your children.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.291
You may never see your girls again.
Do you understand?

09:09.791 --> 09:11.125
I love my kids, all right?

09:11.208 --> 09:12.208
I do.

09:12.875 --> 09:13.708
Who knew?

09:15.291 --> 09:16.833
Your wife knew about it.

09:18.041 --> 09:20.666
Or she had at least started to suspect it.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.833
I tried to get help.
I spoke to someone after the report.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.208
Which report?

09:37.291 --> 09:38.500
To the local authorities.

09:38.583 --> 09:41.916
A social worker came to see us,
but I had my lawyer make it go away.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.875
-That was the end of it.
-The local authority of Gentofte?

09:44.958 --> 09:45.791
Of Copenhagen.

09:46.541 --> 09:47.625
From before we moved.

09:49.333 --> 09:52.375
I asked if there was a report,
but the social worker said no.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.375
Who reported it?

09:57.708 --> 09:59.291
I don't know. It was anonymous.

10:05.250 --> 10:06.500
Sure, okay. No.

10:07.083 --> 10:09.291
Well, that's a pain in the ass.
Thanks a lot.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.250
What did they say?

10:13.041 --> 10:15.333
Social services
can't help us until tomorrow.

10:15.416 --> 10:18.541
-And they want to see a warrant.
-I'll get it.

10:19.208 --> 10:21.916
-And all's fine with the car?
-Yes. You can borrow it.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.333
Thanks for helping me out of that hole.

10:37.666 --> 10:38.500
Hi.

10:39.208 --> 10:41.291
-I thought I'd just stop by.
-Yes.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.208
Are you off now?

10:43.083 --> 10:44.750
-Yes, I am.
-Hi.

10:45.666 --> 10:46.708
-Hi.
-Sebastian.

10:46.791 --> 10:48.625
Hess. He's my…

10:49.625 --> 10:50.458
partner.

10:58.708 --> 11:00.291
Could I borrow that key?

11:10.958 --> 11:13.500
-Where is she?
-Sleeping over at Aksel's.

11:13.583 --> 11:16.833
What a shame.
I was looking forward to seeing her.

11:16.916 --> 11:19.833
-Yes.
-But it does have its advantages.

11:19.916 --> 11:22.583
That extra time, just the two of us.

11:22.666 --> 11:25.541
-You took off last time.
-Yes, I'm sorry.

11:26.833 --> 11:30.708
Do you know what? I'm tired.
I'm not really in the mood for…

11:30.791 --> 11:32.750
We don't have to do anything.

11:32.833 --> 11:36.875
We can just sit here quietly
with a glass of wine and just hang out.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.125
I'm dreaming a little
of us going away for a weekend.

11:47.208 --> 11:50.583
No, thanks. I'm not going anywhere.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.833
Do you know what my job involves?

11:52.916 --> 11:57.791
-No, you're not allowed to tell me.
-What do you want from me?

11:59.041 --> 12:00.041
What do you mean?

12:01.333 --> 12:04.791
Do you dream of having a toothbrush here
or of me meeting your mom?

12:06.541 --> 12:08.000
Do you think that's my dream?

12:08.875 --> 12:11.583
I think it's only natural to dream

12:11.666 --> 12:15.250
about moving in with your girlfriend
and have kids of your own.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.333
Of course. I get that.

12:19.583 --> 12:21.500
I don't think
I can give you what you want.

12:26.083 --> 12:27.541
You can't, or you won't?

12:37.083 --> 12:38.375
What the hell's going on?

12:40.375 --> 12:42.416
Is it that loser down there in the car?

12:45.791 --> 12:46.625
Then what?

12:48.375 --> 12:49.625
Could you leave, please?

12:53.833 --> 12:58.958
Seriously? All I'm doing
is letting your precious job dictate

12:59.041 --> 13:01.208
when, where, and how we meet.

13:13.833 --> 13:16.291
You know what?
You're a fucking cold bitch.

13:16.916 --> 13:18.583
You just want to be on your own.

14:36.666 --> 14:37.916
There you are!

14:38.791 --> 14:40.000
You work too damn hard.

14:41.291 --> 14:44.541
This is Rizwan,
the estate agent I told you about.

14:45.708 --> 14:49.041
I wanted him to see the apartment
so he can give you a good price.

14:50.416 --> 14:52.416
-Sure.
-Think about it.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.000
He's ten percent above market.

14:54.791 --> 14:55.791
See you later.

14:56.625 --> 14:59.166
By the way,
I popped the sander in your apartment.

15:02.000 --> 15:02.833
Thank you.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.333
WEDNESDAY, 14 OCTOBER

15:05.416 --> 15:10.041
<i>The murders of 37-year-old dental nurse</i>
<i>Laura Kjær from Husum</i>

15:10.125 --> 15:13.583
<i>and 36-year-old</i>
<i>Anne Sejer-Lassen from Klampenborg</i>

15:13.666 --> 15:17.375
<i>have sparked rumors of a possible</i>
<i>connection between the killings.</i>

15:17.458 --> 15:19.500
<i>The murders happened a few days apart,</i>

15:19.583 --> 15:23.166
<i>and anonymous sources claim</i>
<i>the murders bear certain resemblances</i>.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.500
-<i>The police have no comment…</i>
-Are you ready?

15:25.583 --> 15:27.500
<i>…on whether it's the same perpetrator.</i>

15:28.416 --> 15:29.541
Where are we going?

15:29.625 --> 15:32.875
Bukke is finalizing the last amendments
in the conference room.

15:32.958 --> 15:34.208
He's finally caved.

15:34.291 --> 15:37.583
Great. You go ahead.
I need to talk to Liv.

15:39.125 --> 15:42.166
Liv, did the head of homicide
try to reach me again?

15:42.250 --> 15:46.083
No. But I know
the police contacted social services.

15:46.875 --> 15:47.708
Why?

15:48.416 --> 15:49.250
I don't know.

15:49.875 --> 15:53.500
I asked the local authority
for some statistics this morning.

15:53.583 --> 15:56.708
The whole department was
at a standstill because of a warrant.

15:57.208 --> 15:58.916
-A warrant?
-Yes.

16:00.375 --> 16:01.791
-Hi, Liv.
-Hi.

16:05.208 --> 16:08.166
-Do you have a minute?
-Sure, I'll be right there.

16:09.791 --> 16:13.958
-I'm quite busy.
-Yes, of course.

16:14.833 --> 16:17.708
You left your keys on the kitchen counter.

16:20.416 --> 16:21.250
Thank you.

16:29.416 --> 16:31.166
-Steen, what--
-I thought about it.

16:31.708 --> 16:33.666
What you said yesterday. About Gustav.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.583
I think you're right.

16:38.250 --> 16:39.583
We do need to protect him.

16:45.291 --> 16:48.333
So I'm going to stop…

16:52.500 --> 16:54.500
We're off to the cinema later.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.541
That sounds nice.

16:59.125 --> 17:00.708
I wish I could join you.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.083
Do you know what…

17:03.916 --> 17:05.791
Maybe I can reschedule some meetings.

17:08.166 --> 17:12.083
Let me check.
We could grab burgers beforehand?

17:16.875 --> 17:18.791
Let me know if you can make it.

17:19.375 --> 17:20.208
Sure.

17:20.791 --> 17:21.791
I'll call you later.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.708
See you later.

17:43.208 --> 17:46.583
When we spoke yesterday,
the system crashed, so I couldn't--

17:46.666 --> 17:50.375
No. You said no report was made
regarding the Sejer-Lassen girls.

17:50.458 --> 17:52.708
-No, you misheard.
-Here's what I think.

17:52.791 --> 17:57.333
You saw a file from the hospital when
you entered the social security numbers.

17:57.416 --> 18:00.708
You hadn't followed up,
so you panicked, because the mom is dead.

18:01.375 --> 18:02.375
You made a mistake.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.458
I'm really sorry
if we held up the investigation.

18:06.125 --> 18:10.666
But I assure you that our social workers
are working hard to clear the paperwork.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.666
Yes. And we visited the family--

18:12.750 --> 18:17.166
Don't apologize to me, apologize to
the girls who took the beatings.

18:17.250 --> 18:19.083
-And the abused boy.
-Do you have a sec?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.625
Yes, because this is pointless.

18:22.833 --> 18:25.125
I've compared the two reports.

18:25.708 --> 18:29.750
The one against Laura Kjær
with the one against Sejer-Lassen.

18:33.125 --> 18:35.125
SELFISH WHORE

18:39.125 --> 18:41.708
"You selfish whore.
You should know better."

18:41.791 --> 18:43.916
-The same language repeats.
-Exactly.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.041
If the murderer sent two reports
against women, who were then killed,

18:49.416 --> 18:51.708
he may already
have reported his next victim.

18:55.166 --> 18:56.291
Hey, you two.

18:56.375 --> 19:00.500
We need all anonymous reports of neglect
and child abuse for the past year.

19:00.583 --> 19:03.166
Only reports
where you deemed it unnecessary to act.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.750
-Get to it.
-Of course.

19:20.291 --> 19:21.125
What…

19:21.875 --> 19:23.958
-What is this?
-The reports we asked for.

19:24.916 --> 19:27.916
We need more manpower
to quickly get through all of it.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.166
Thomsen, make sure you handle that.

19:30.250 --> 19:31.583
Let me know what you find.

19:32.666 --> 19:34.625
We need to speak to Rose Hartung again.

19:37.083 --> 19:38.458
Why? Is there any news?

19:38.541 --> 19:43.083
No, but the murderer is very likely
behind the anonymous reports.

19:44.166 --> 19:47.208
He killed two women
for being irresponsible mothers

19:47.291 --> 19:50.208
and left Kristine Hartung's prints
at the crime scenes.

19:50.291 --> 19:52.916
It's a direct nod to the minister.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
-I don't think she knows anything else.
-We need to be sure though.

19:58.875 --> 20:00.333
Let me tell you something.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.416
I lived in their living room
for three months.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.750
I saw the parents go from hope
to deep despair every single day.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.166
-I'm not putting them through that again.
-No.

20:13.333 --> 20:16.291
But it wouldn't be nice
if you were wrong either, would it?

20:18.583 --> 20:20.583
I'm not wrong, Hess.

20:30.083 --> 20:33.625
"HE PISSES HIS PANTS IN FEAR
WHEN SHE SAYS THINGS LIKE…"

20:41.958 --> 20:46.166
"…I'VE SEEN THE BITCH
GRAB AND SHAKE HER BOY IN THE PLAYGROUND."

20:55.041 --> 20:57.208
"…DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR KIDS."

21:08.791 --> 21:09.791
How far did you get?

21:11.208 --> 21:13.791
Nobody's using the phrase "selfish whore"

21:13.875 --> 21:16.875
or "she should know better",
as the other reports said.

21:16.958 --> 21:19.041
Why did you pick those? Can I see?

21:19.125 --> 21:20.125
Sure.

21:20.208 --> 21:24.166
The authorities found nothing on Kjær
or Sejer-Lassen, but the kids were harmed,

21:24.250 --> 21:27.208
so I tried to find cases
where the authorities got it wrong.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.083
I picked the same five files.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.333
The families are very dysfunctional.

21:39.083 --> 21:40.750
It's still completely impossible.

21:42.291 --> 21:43.416
It makes no sense.

21:45.333 --> 21:46.625
Why not just kill them?

21:47.375 --> 21:49.041
Why bother to report them first?

21:50.458 --> 21:53.375
Maybe he gave the authorities
a last chance to intervene,

21:53.458 --> 21:54.625
but they never did.

21:58.625 --> 22:01.083
-What if he changed his writing style?
-Huh?

22:03.708 --> 22:07.000
If you were the murderer
and wrote the first two reports

22:07.083 --> 22:09.333
knowing the police
were looking for a third,

22:10.791 --> 22:11.958
how would you write it?

22:12.041 --> 22:14.833
The LIX is low in both reports.

22:14.916 --> 22:20.500
If we presume
that the murderer wants to confuse us,

22:20.583 --> 22:23.583
then at least
two of the five reports stick out.

22:25.208 --> 22:29.541
They're well-written, well-phrased
and without spelling mistakes or typos.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.500
Which one is the most well-written?

22:35.166 --> 22:36.083
Jessie Kvium's.

22:37.625 --> 22:41.041
"Jessie Kvium, 24,
single mom to daughter Olivia, aged six."

22:41.125 --> 22:42.875
<i>"No contact with the dad."</i>

22:42.958 --> 22:46.958
<i>Report says she's often intoxicated,</i>
<i>even when the daughter is there.</i>

22:47.041 --> 22:51.375
<i>The neighbors often complain</i>
<i>about guests and loud music till late.</i>

22:55.958 --> 23:00.416
Bend, and stretch…

23:00.500 --> 23:02.541
And bend. Crossing our hands.

23:05.041 --> 23:06.583
In and out…

23:11.000 --> 23:14.291
That's great! In and out…

23:14.375 --> 23:18.458
Hands on your hips, and side to side…

23:19.250 --> 23:20.125
Arms up!

23:20.208 --> 23:22.333
-…giant infinity pool.
-Yes.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.125
But they can't do anything.
We go back, pack everything up and--

23:26.208 --> 23:27.791
-Hi, Nikolaj.
-Hi.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.833
So even if it wasn't the plan…

23:30.916 --> 23:33.500
What else do you want
other than to lounge by the pool?

23:33.583 --> 23:35.625
I really recommend it.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.666
Did you make
the parent-teacher meeting on Friday?

23:40.458 --> 23:42.000
No, my wife dealt with it.

23:43.250 --> 23:48.750
Actually, I wanted to chat to you
about the class culture. It's important.

23:52.125 --> 23:53.458
Would you excuse me?

24:38.791 --> 24:40.958
That was the last time. Got it?

24:41.791 --> 24:42.916
I'm married.

24:43.541 --> 24:45.625
And don't follow me, goddammit.

24:54.500 --> 24:57.291
Fuck you, you smug clown!

24:57.375 --> 25:00.333
You can stick your fucking Audi
where the sun doesn't shine.

25:05.375 --> 25:06.583
Fucking door. Hello!

26:30.541 --> 26:33.291
How do we know that she's the next victim?

26:34.666 --> 26:36.583
Your plan sounds pretty risky.

26:37.333 --> 26:40.083
We don't know, but she's our best bet.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.750
Looking at the time
between the first two killings,

26:42.833 --> 26:44.375
there's no time to waste.

26:44.458 --> 26:47.000
What are you trying to tell me?

26:47.541 --> 26:49.583
That there's a creepy stalker out there?

26:51.041 --> 26:53.625
We need to find out who sent that report.

26:53.708 --> 26:57.166
-I told you it was a mom at school.
-We don't think so.

26:57.250 --> 26:59.750
It's fucking hard
to have the authorities on your ass.

26:59.833 --> 27:00.875
Listen to me.

27:00.958 --> 27:04.458
If there's any truth to this,
your life may be in danger. Got it?

27:04.541 --> 27:05.458
There isn't.

27:11.708 --> 27:15.458
You said you felt like
someone followed you.

27:16.375 --> 27:17.750
-In the mall.
-Under it.

27:18.583 --> 27:19.500
In the basement.

27:21.041 --> 27:22.041
Tell me how it felt.

27:22.541 --> 27:24.916
-I told that other one. The woman.
-Tell me.

27:26.666 --> 27:29.583
I heard footsteps.
They stopped whenever I stopped.

27:30.375 --> 27:33.333
-Did you see anything?
-No. I told you that.

27:33.416 --> 27:34.250
It was dark.

27:34.875 --> 27:36.708
What were you doing in the basement?

27:51.541 --> 27:53.750
So? Are we barking up the wrong tree?

27:55.333 --> 27:56.750
I think she might be next.

27:56.833 --> 27:59.000
The authorities say she's an alcoholic.

27:59.083 --> 28:02.666
Meetings with school. Teachers alleging
she's neglecting her daughter.

28:02.750 --> 28:06.083
And she believed
she was being followed at the mall.

28:06.166 --> 28:07.125
Boss, take a look.

28:08.291 --> 28:09.416
We may have a problem.

28:10.583 --> 28:12.916
BREAKING: IS KRISTINE HARTUNG ALIVE?

28:13.000 --> 28:14.208
For fuck's sake!

28:15.000 --> 28:17.166
Nylander, what do you think?

28:19.458 --> 28:20.541
How long do you need?

28:23.250 --> 28:26.375
Boss, the reporters are asking
for a statement on the murders.

28:26.458 --> 28:29.000
-What do I tell them?
-"No comment."

28:30.416 --> 28:31.958
May I have your attention?

28:38.416 --> 28:39.458
<i>Gustav?</i>

28:40.750 --> 28:41.583
Are you coming?

28:42.208 --> 28:45.333
-We need to buy some candy.
-Sure. What about Mom?

28:47.750 --> 28:50.291
She couldn't make it after all. Sorry. So…

28:52.583 --> 28:53.791
It'll just be us guys.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.708
Hi. Sorry to disturb you.

29:05.791 --> 29:07.000
Steen Hartung?

29:07.500 --> 29:11.458
Sorry for just showing up,
but I did try to call you a few times.

29:11.541 --> 29:14.750
I'm Niels Davidsen, <i>Background </i>reporter.
Do you have a comment?

29:15.625 --> 29:16.708
A comment on what?

29:16.791 --> 29:19.375
In connection
with the murders of two women,

29:19.458 --> 29:22.125
we've heard rumors of some fingerprints.

29:22.208 --> 29:23.375
I've heard nothing.

29:23.458 --> 29:27.250
Your daughter's prints
are being connected to two murders.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.208
According to our police source.

29:29.291 --> 29:32.541
-I don't know anything.
-It makes you wonder if she's still alive.

29:35.416 --> 29:37.333
Could you come to the studio tonight?

29:38.375 --> 29:40.625
My son and I are going to the cinema.

29:40.708 --> 29:42.083
-Please leave.
-Steen…

29:59.250 --> 30:00.166
Dad, who was it?

30:04.250 --> 30:05.083
Dad, who was it?

30:06.416 --> 30:07.541
Nobody.

30:21.916 --> 30:22.833
Get the glue.

30:23.500 --> 30:26.166
-Where it is?
-Wherever we keep the glue, all right?

30:28.333 --> 30:29.666
Just get the fucking glue!

30:31.958 --> 30:33.625
-I'm going to Victor's.
-Gustav.

30:34.958 --> 30:35.791
Gustav.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.291
Could you move your homework?

30:55.958 --> 30:58.708
-How long will you be gone?
-I told you that.

31:00.625 --> 31:01.833
Could you set the table?

31:06.125 --> 31:08.625
-You didn't make the lantern party.
-No.

31:10.333 --> 31:12.916
Why can't Sebastian
just be here sometimes?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.208
We've got Grandpa.

31:15.041 --> 31:18.250
And don't ask him
about piercing your ears. Ask me.

31:18.333 --> 31:19.375
Do you hear me?

31:20.125 --> 31:21.500
It's a really bad idea.

31:22.333 --> 31:27.208
-You could rip your earlobe--
-But I made Sebastian some drawings.

31:27.291 --> 31:29.875
You said he could come over.

31:29.958 --> 31:32.041
But we're not together anymore.

31:32.125 --> 31:35.416
We're good friends,
but we're not boyfriend and girlfriend.

31:35.500 --> 31:38.458
I know, but he'll
still come for sleepovers, right?

31:38.541 --> 31:39.750
No, he won't. It's over.

31:40.583 --> 31:43.666
-Why did you break up?
-That's none of your business.

31:43.750 --> 31:46.958
-Yes, it really is!
-No, this is a grownup thing.

31:47.041 --> 31:49.500
-Fucking grownup things.
-We don't use that language!

31:50.416 --> 31:52.250
How do you know? You're never here.

31:53.875 --> 31:55.708
Could you open the door for Grandpa?

32:08.500 --> 32:10.875
It's not him.
It's someone from your shitty job.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.000
I just wanted to go over the basics
before we leave.

32:17.791 --> 32:20.000
-Sorry, it's dinnertime.
-That's okay.

32:20.625 --> 32:22.958
-The place is set for my grandpa.
-Le, stop it.

32:23.041 --> 32:26.416
-I'll take a walk.
-No, wait.

32:28.625 --> 32:29.625
Eat your vegetables.

32:33.291 --> 32:35.125
-Would you like more?
-No, thank you.

32:36.500 --> 32:37.791
It was really nice.

32:40.125 --> 32:40.958
You're lying.

32:43.666 --> 32:45.625
Grandpa is coming, so get ready.

32:59.583 --> 33:01.375
It's not my real grandpa.

33:02.333 --> 33:05.083
He's helping my mom
because she doesn't have parents.

33:09.208 --> 33:10.541
You've two different eyes.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.208
Yes, I do. That's right.

33:16.250 --> 33:17.750
Is that a budgie?

33:21.541 --> 33:22.416
Do you have kids?

33:23.708 --> 33:24.541
No.

33:26.375 --> 33:27.291
A wife?

33:28.541 --> 33:29.375
No.

33:31.166 --> 33:34.250
-Are you not good at having a girlfriend?
-Yes, I am.

33:35.333 --> 33:36.958
But my wife died.

33:39.208 --> 33:40.250
How did she die?

33:43.125 --> 33:45.208
-You don't want to hear that.
-I do.

33:51.708 --> 33:52.583
She…

33:56.333 --> 33:57.166
She…

33:57.666 --> 34:00.833
There was a fire where we lived.

34:03.083 --> 34:06.833
We'd just moved in,
and there was some illegal wiring.

34:07.666 --> 34:09.083
I think…

34:10.875 --> 34:13.083
I wasn't at home. But she was.

34:18.291 --> 34:21.875
If there's a fire here,
I'd run out as fast as I could.

34:26.291 --> 34:27.375
I feel sorry for you.

34:29.958 --> 34:31.916
-Why don't you go and watch TV?
-Okay.

34:39.166 --> 34:41.625
-Let's go over the plan.
-Yes, let's.

34:48.500 --> 34:49.666
Where does Jessie live?

35:17.666 --> 35:20.666
<i>We've got Kvium's car.</i>
<i>Englandsvej 17. Over.</i>

35:36.083 --> 35:39.666
<i>Kvium and her daughter are moving</i>
<i>towards East Block 18 on foot. Over.</i>

35:57.958 --> 36:01.500
<i>Kvium arriving at her apartment.</i>
<i>6th floor. Hess, over.</i>

36:38.791 --> 36:40.166
<i>…disappeared last fall.</i>

36:40.250 --> 36:42.541
<i>Police have found</i>
<i>the prints of Kristine Hartung,</i>

36:42.625 --> 36:46.000
<i>who was presumed dead last year.</i>

36:46.083 --> 36:48.458
<i>The police have no comments</i> <i>on the rumors</i>

36:48.541 --> 36:53.291
<i>and state</i> <i>that the case was solved</i>
<i>and that, in addition to the evidence,</i>

36:53.375 --> 36:56.791
<i>they also have a full confession</i>
<i>from Linus Bekker…</i>

36:57.875 --> 37:00.666
<i>-I'm in position.</i>
-We're ready and in position.

37:00.750 --> 37:03.125
If he turns up, we'll see him.

37:03.208 --> 37:04.291
<i>Bloody hell.</i>

37:04.375 --> 37:05.208
<i>What is it?</i>

37:05.291 --> 37:06.416
<i>…Kristine. Good night.</i>

37:06.500 --> 37:09.041
-Steen Hartung's on TV.
-<i>Good evening.</i>

37:09.125 --> 37:12.750
<i>Two murder investigations</i>
<i>involving Kristine's fingerprints.</i>

37:13.750 --> 37:16.375
<i>-That must be overwhelming…</i>
-I just heard--

37:16.458 --> 37:19.666
<i>-Do you think Kristine is alive?</i>
<i>-Yes. I think she might be.</i>

37:20.916 --> 37:23.041
<i>It must be a huge shock--</i>

37:23.125 --> 37:25.708
<i>That's why I want to appeal to people.</i>

37:25.791 --> 37:27.125
<i>If anyone knows anything,</i>

37:27.208 --> 37:31.125
<i>if you've seen anything involving</i>
<i>our daughter, contact the police.</i>

37:31.208 --> 37:32.958
<i>-</i>Where is Vogel?
-<i>It's not too late.</i>

37:34.500 --> 37:35.666
<i>If you took Kristine…</i>

37:35.750 --> 37:41.083
<i>-</i>Find him now!
<i>-Please bring her back to us.</i>

37:42.333 --> 37:44.833
<i>-</i>When did you set this up?
-We didn't.

37:44.916 --> 37:48.125
<i>-She doesn't deserve this.</i>
-Rosa, this will have consequences.

37:48.208 --> 37:51.000
<i>Kristine deserves to be with her friends.</i>

37:52.125 --> 37:53.916
-<i>Go to school.</i>
<i>-</i>Liv Christiansen.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.458
<i>She deserves to be with her family,</i>
<i>to return to her life.</i>

37:57.541 --> 37:59.041
It's the minister of justice.

37:59.125 --> 38:01.666
<i>What would you say</i>
<i>to Kristine if she's watching?</i>

38:01.750 --> 38:02.958
<i>We miss you.</i>

38:07.708 --> 38:09.541
<i>We won't give up until we find you.</i>

38:31.875 --> 38:32.708
Where's Gustav?

38:33.833 --> 38:34.666
He's asleep.

38:35.916 --> 38:37.500
He's completely broken.

38:45.041 --> 38:45.958
I didn't mean to--

38:46.041 --> 38:49.625
Most nights I can't sleep,
because I think I can hear her.

38:50.958 --> 38:54.708
Every time I look out of the window,
I see her on the garden swing.

38:57.125 --> 38:58.708
I hear her laughter in the car.

39:00.666 --> 39:03.000
I can feel her warm hands as I held them

39:03.083 --> 39:05.333
when she was in the hospital
for her appendix.

39:09.125 --> 39:09.958
Rosa.

39:12.625 --> 39:14.375
I wouldn't have done this…

39:16.958 --> 39:19.333
if I didn't believe it
with all of my heart.

39:26.166 --> 39:27.250
I can feel her.

39:28.541 --> 39:29.875
I know she's out there.

39:38.041 --> 39:38.875
Honey.

39:40.583 --> 39:41.416
Honey.

39:42.208 --> 39:43.291
Can't you feel her?

40:11.333 --> 40:13.958
<i>Nothing near the entrance. Over.</i>

40:33.625 --> 40:35.250
<i>-Anything?</i>
-What's up?

40:35.333 --> 40:38.250
-Why are you turning off the lights?
-<i>"Jessie" is going to bed.</i>

40:39.875 --> 40:40.833
How about you guys?

40:42.833 --> 40:44.333
Not a peep.

40:46.208 --> 40:48.416
We don't know if he'll strike tonight.

40:50.375 --> 40:52.166
We're going to look like fools.

40:52.791 --> 40:56.000
-You will, mainly. This was your idea.
<i>-Yes.</i>

41:01.791 --> 41:03.000
<i>By the way…</i>

41:04.541 --> 41:05.625
I…

41:07.291 --> 41:09.166
I'm sorry about your wife.

41:14.333 --> 41:17.333
-Your daughter's a bright one, huh?
<i>-Yes.</i>

41:18.541 --> 41:22.291
<i>It's mainly down to her,</i>
<i>and to her grandpa of course.</i>

41:24.375 --> 41:29.041
-She mentioned he helps out sometimes.
-<i>That's an understatement.</i>

41:30.125 --> 41:33.750
It started when Aksel
and his wife took care of me years ago.

41:34.583 --> 41:37.625
<i>-How come?</i>
-I wasn't in the best of places…

41:39.291 --> 41:41.416
Since then,
he's been there for both of us.

41:45.791 --> 41:49.500
-And her dad?
<i>-He's not even worth mentioning.</i>

41:52.583 --> 41:55.083
That's why I want to transfer to NC3.

41:59.583 --> 42:00.708
<i>To give you more time?</i>

42:01.958 --> 42:05.708
Too many nightmares and too little sleep.
It's hard to filter it all out.

42:06.833 --> 42:10.416
<i>Yes, but that's also the reason</i>
<i>why you are good at your job.</i>

42:11.208 --> 42:12.041
Perhaps.

42:14.083 --> 42:17.833
<i>The male who was smoking</i>
<i>is moving towards the entrance. Over.</i>

42:19.666 --> 42:21.708
<i>Do you have a description? Jansen, over.</i>

42:22.750 --> 42:26.291
<i>No, he's wearing a hoodie.</i>
<i>Medium height, slender. Over.</i>

42:28.208 --> 42:29.166
Hess, what's up?

42:33.875 --> 42:36.416
<i>Someone snuck in though the entrance.</i>
<i>Go to radio.</i>

42:39.833 --> 42:42.375
<i>Bravo, confirm if he's armed.</i>
<i>Jansen, over.</i>

42:50.833 --> 42:52.750
<i>Fourth floor. Bravo, over.</i>

43:03.666 --> 43:05.375
<i>Fifth floor. Bravo, over.</i>

43:08.250 --> 43:10.291
Thulin, he's on your floor. Over.

43:15.708 --> 43:17.666
<i>He's passing the apartment. Hess, over.</i>

43:36.541 --> 43:39.458
<i>He's turning around.</i>
<i>Bravo, ready. Hess, over.</i>

43:44.000 --> 43:45.125
<i>Bravo, go ahead.</i>

44:09.208 --> 44:12.041
<i>-</i>Stay still!
-What the hell are you doing? Let go!

44:12.125 --> 44:15.291
I haven't done anything. I haven't done…

44:15.375 --> 44:17.208
Nikolaj Møller, Mantuavej 76.

44:17.875 --> 44:20.041
-What do you want?
-I wanted to talk to Jessie.

44:20.125 --> 44:21.208
What about?

44:21.291 --> 44:22.916
-She texted me.
-Texted?

44:24.250 --> 44:25.083
Pin?

44:25.583 --> 44:27.583
-The pin for your mobile?
-2003.

44:28.166 --> 44:29.583
What the hell is going on?

44:30.625 --> 44:33.291
"Come to my place,
or I'll send these to your wife."

44:33.375 --> 44:35.958
She's blackmailing me.
I wanted to frighten her.

44:36.041 --> 44:36.875
Shut up.

44:43.666 --> 44:44.875
Who filmed them?

44:46.125 --> 44:47.833
The text is from a blocked number.

44:48.750 --> 44:49.750
Half an hour ago.

44:50.791 --> 44:54.875
-Who's with Jessie?
-Ricks. In a cottage she borrows.

45:02.791 --> 45:03.625
What's up?

45:03.708 --> 45:05.333
Can we go home soon?

45:05.416 --> 45:06.291
No.

45:09.875 --> 45:10.708
Get some sleep.

45:12.833 --> 45:15.708
-Where's the other cop?
-He's grabbing pizzas.

45:16.916 --> 45:20.125
And meanwhile,
you're spending some time on PornHub?

45:25.750 --> 45:26.875
So what if I am?

45:31.333 --> 45:32.166
What the hell?

45:36.250 --> 45:37.083
Stay here.

46:35.583 --> 46:36.416
<i>Hello?</i>

46:39.750 --> 46:40.750
Where are you?

46:50.416 --> 46:51.291
Is anybody there?

47:07.958 --> 47:08.791
Olivia?

47:10.916 --> 47:11.750
Honey?

47:38.833 --> 47:39.708
Mom?

47:43.791 --> 47:45.666
Mom, I'm thirsty.

47:47.958 --> 47:48.791
Jessie!

47:50.625 --> 47:52.875
Hi, Olivia. Don't worry, don't be scared.

47:52.958 --> 47:54.458
I'm Mark. I'm with the police.

47:54.541 --> 47:57.000
-Do you know where your mom is?
-No.

47:57.083 --> 47:57.916
Jansen?

47:59.333 --> 48:00.166
Ricks.

48:02.916 --> 48:04.000
Oh God, no!

48:06.666 --> 48:08.125
Ambulance. Now!

48:12.541 --> 48:13.375
Jessie!

48:19.375 --> 48:20.208
Hess.

48:51.333 --> 48:52.625
I'll get the others.

48:56.208 --> 48:57.041
Hess.

48:58.250 --> 48:59.083
Hess.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.125
Jansen, over here.
