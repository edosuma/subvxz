WEBVTT

00:11.575 --> 00:16.175
Tonight, the brighter,
whiter way to ruin your underpants.

00:16.175 --> 00:19.815
How much lorry-ing
can you get for £5,000?

00:21.575 --> 00:25.096
And Michael Parkinson has a go
in tu' reasonably priced car.

00:30.895 --> 00:33.055
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:33.055 --> 00:35.615
Hello! Hello and welcome!

00:35.615 --> 00:36.736
Hello!

00:36.736 --> 00:42.016
Thank you so much, thank you and
welcome to a brand new series.

00:42.016 --> 00:47.375
Now, in this series we thought
we'd aim it at a slightly
more mature, older audience,

00:47.375 --> 00:52.175
so we did a thing on why beige
is the right colour for your car.

00:52.175 --> 00:55.776
Erm, we did... I went on a coach
tour of North Wales.

00:55.776 --> 01:02.855
And then, and then we found out
the BBC is putting us up against
Strictly Come Sequins.

01:02.855 --> 01:04.935
The same time, on the other side!

01:04.935 --> 01:07.976
Now, everyone over the age of 85
is gonna be watching that,

01:07.976 --> 01:13.975
so we had to throw all our hard
work away, and literally,
yesterday morning, begin again.

01:13.975 --> 01:17.415
Here comes a taster now of what
we've been able to cobble together.

01:19.216 --> 01:21.696
Blinkers on, and off we go!

01:22.655 --> 01:24.336
Aagh! Ha-ha!

01:25.936 --> 01:26.976
Wow! This is great!

01:28.615 --> 01:30.695
Right, San Tropez.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.456
Please can I go home?

01:35.456 --> 01:36.656
No!

01:37.696 --> 01:38.736
Go, go, go!

01:44.256 --> 01:47.655
Come o-o-o-on!

01:47.655 --> 01:49.135
Check it out!

01:51.535 --> 01:53.655
Forward into the pages of history!

01:58.415 --> 01:59.736
This is important work.

02:00.896 --> 02:02.855
Stig's Communist cousin.

02:07.375 --> 02:09.136
Goodbye, Mr May!

02:10.255 --> 02:11.856
It's Hakkinen!

02:13.616 --> 02:15.496
Now, I'm just utterly lost.

02:19.936 --> 02:21.336
Back to the studio.

02:21.336 --> 02:22.855
Hey, that's my line!

02:22.855 --> 02:24.016
ALL LAUGH

02:24.016 --> 02:25.456
APPLAUSE

02:25.456 --> 02:26.536
Not bad, hey?

02:26.536 --> 02:28.376
All that in 24 hours.

02:30.615 --> 02:34.495
So anyway, that's
what's coming up in the series.

02:34.495 --> 02:38.976
Now, let's get on with tonight,
has bought Volkswagen,

02:38.976 --> 02:42.536
and as a result every hedge
in the world has gone bust.

02:42.536 --> 02:45.856
I've no idea what any of that means,
but I do understand this,

02:45.856 --> 02:53.335
it is the GTII, it's a lightweight,
stripped out, hardcore two-wheel
drive version of the Turbo.

02:53.335 --> 02:55.976
And I've been out on the track
to see what it's like.

02:57.095 --> 03:03.696
Aaaaaaagh!

03:05.496 --> 03:07.576
Aaaaaaagh!

03:07.576 --> 03:10.735
Aaaaaaagh!

03:14.735 --> 03:18.216
And that concludes
my road test of the GTII.

03:18.216 --> 03:19.215
It's terrifying.

03:21.775 --> 03:25.736
Which is why, if I wanted
a really fast two-seater,

03:25.736 --> 03:28.495
I'd get one of these.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.074

03:39.376 --> 03:43.335
Some people have said
in the last year or so
that the Lamborghini Gallardo

03:43.335 --> 03:47.016
is just an Audi R8 with a fancy name
and a bigger price tag.

03:48.776 --> 03:54.496
Not any more it isn't.

03:54.496 --> 04:00.016
This new model,
daintily called the LP560-4,

04:00.016 --> 04:02.976
looks pretty much
the same as the old model.

04:02.976 --> 04:07.255
But it's 20 kilograms lighter,
and more powerful.

04:14.296 --> 04:17.894
It now has a 5.2-litre V10,

04:17.894 --> 04:22.296
which produces 552 horsepowers.

04:25.855 --> 04:32.176
That means this streak of
white lightning is faster even
than the old Gallardo Super Legera.

04:32.176 --> 04:35.016
It's faster, too,
than a Ferrari Scuderia.

04:45.775 --> 04:50.935
That thing has launched control,
you put it in first, built the
boost up to 13lb per square inch,

04:50.935 --> 04:56.215
dump the clutch, and you're off.
This has something
called thrust control.

04:56.215 --> 05:02.136
I think that sounds like the hero
in an airport thriller -
Thrust Control.

05:02.136 --> 05:05.536
What you do, put it in Corsa,
which means...something.

05:05.536 --> 05:09.136
Turn off the traction control,
like so.

05:09.136 --> 05:11.455
Left foot on the brake,
build the revs up...

05:22.416 --> 05:23.375
Oh, my God!

05:26.256 --> 05:27.656
Wow!

05:30.456 --> 05:32.295
That's so fast.

05:49.735 --> 05:55.136
So, the Lamborghini is faster,
and it's nicer to drive as well.

05:56.135 --> 05:59.616
In a corner, the GTII
was all over the place,

05:59.616 --> 06:01.696
the wheel was bucking and riding,

06:01.696 --> 06:05.536
the back end was playing hopscotch,
the front end was pitter-pattering.

06:09.455 --> 06:11.215
Look at it!

06:13.135 --> 06:16.856
I can see it here, look, following
me around on this rear-view camera,

06:16.856 --> 06:23.176
it's like being chased
around by a turbocharged,
newly-born albino smoking horse!

06:30.655 --> 06:35.736
Don't get me wrong,
this is still very Lamborghin-ish.

06:35.736 --> 06:36.936
Loud, big grunt...

06:40.096 --> 06:44.855
But behind the shouty,
get out of my way exterior

06:44.855 --> 06:49.336
beats the heart of
a big four-wheel-drive softie.

06:50.496 --> 06:56.535
I'm not kidding, anyone could get
into this and drive it very fast
straight away, no problem at all.

07:10.776 --> 07:14.055
MUSIC: THE ARCHERS THEME

07:37.575 --> 07:38.696
Drawbacks?

07:38.696 --> 07:40.936
You have to have
the flappy paddle gear box,

07:40.936 --> 07:43.695
which is annoying some of the time.

07:43.695 --> 07:45.816
Like for instance
when you're parking.

07:45.816 --> 07:50.095
But the option is
the six-speed manual,
which comes with the clutch pedal,

07:50.095 --> 07:52.775
and that means there's nowhere to
put your left foot.

07:52.775 --> 07:54.455
And that's annoying all the time.

07:59.336 --> 08:01.056
So far as styling's concerned,

08:01.056 --> 08:06.696
the GTII is just
a squashed Volkswagen Beetle
with a wing on the back.

08:13.495 --> 08:18.016
The Lamborghini on the other hand
will probably go down
in automotive history

08:18.016 --> 08:21.496
as one of the all-time
great-looking cars.

08:26.255 --> 08:29.455
Especially with its
pointy new Reventon-style nose.

08:31.496 --> 08:37.056
They say this new shape is much less
damaging to any pedestrians
you might hit.

08:37.056 --> 08:39.256
But, if I were a pedestrian,

08:39.256 --> 08:41.856
and I saw one of these
things coming, I'd just go...

08:47.296 --> 08:52.896
As I see it, there's just one
drawback to this low-riding Lambo.

08:52.896 --> 08:57.935
At £147,000, it's even more
expensive than a loaf of bread.

08:59.656 --> 09:03.335
So, it's your choice, really.
You can have a dog.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.375
Aaarrghhh!

09:09.296 --> 09:13.016
Or a car that can be driven by one.

09:20.056 --> 09:27.055
How can you not like the GTII,
you great, fat, balding, useless,

09:27.055 --> 09:32.896
hopeless, bandy-legged bubble head,
pointless, talentless, gutless,

09:32.896 --> 09:36.496
cowardly, witless lump
of suede shoe-wearing

09:36.496 --> 09:38.656
daft-jean wearing idiocy?

09:38.656 --> 09:41.615
I knew you were gonna say that.
All of that?

09:41.615 --> 09:44.896
So I've decided that we're gonna
settle this on the track, OK?

09:44.896 --> 09:48.136
That means handing these cars
over to our tame racing driver.

09:48.136 --> 09:52.256
Some say that he sleeps inside out.

09:54.536 --> 09:58.816
And that he once had full sex with
Russell Brand's answering machine.

10:03.975 --> 10:05.335
All we know is,

10:05.335 --> 10:06.895
he's called The Stig!

10:06.895 --> 10:10.735
And he's off! Just a hint of
wheelspin, but then it digs in,

10:10.735 --> 10:13.096
this thing really is
ferocious off the line.

10:13.096 --> 10:16.416
The green Lambo here, Stig
trying to mount the white one!

10:16.416 --> 10:19.936
Very composed through
the first corner,

10:19.936 --> 10:21.856
like to see the Porsche try that!

10:21.856 --> 10:23.855
BEEPING

10:26.656 --> 10:29.856
Yes, Stig appears to have
started listening to Morse code,

10:29.856 --> 10:32.616
very strange, or maybe
it's him making that noise!

10:32.616 --> 10:35.256
Belts it through Chicago.
Now, Hammerhead...

10:35.256 --> 10:38.735
Four-wheel drive, of course,
that should keep it tidy.

10:38.735 --> 10:41.056
Yes, it does!
Not a hint of understeer,

10:41.056 --> 10:44.096
just a wall of that V10 noise.

10:44.096 --> 10:46.215
BEEPING
And Morse code.

10:50.575 --> 10:52.096
Now, Follow-through.

10:52.096 --> 10:57.376
Look at that, he's having to use
a flick of opposite lock,
Stig's really going for it!

10:57.376 --> 11:01.975
Steps out again after
the tyres, steady on,
you Morse-crazed mentalist!

11:01.975 --> 11:06.295
Two corners left, still working
hard, only Gambon to go now.

11:06.295 --> 11:09.415
Look at this! Here he comes,
he just glides it through,

11:09.415 --> 11:11.056
and across the line!

11:12.175 --> 11:17.416
The Lamborghini did it in 1.19.5,

11:17.416 --> 11:20.015
that's quicker
than the Scuderia, I said.

11:20.015 --> 11:21.216
Now let's do the news.

11:21.216 --> 11:23.816
No, no, no! Very good,
but what about the Porsche?

11:23.816 --> 11:27.656
No, what did the Porsche do it in?
I don't think anybody's interested.

11:27.656 --> 11:30.895
It was faster, wasn't it?

11:30.895 --> 11:33.255
What time did the GTII manage?

11:33.255 --> 11:35.336
Tell me the time for the Porsche.

11:35.336 --> 11:36.496
It's caught fire.

11:36.496 --> 11:41.496
I don't know how that happened, it's
literally spontaneously combusted!

11:42.816 --> 11:44.695
Where does it go on the board?

11:44.695 --> 11:46.576
Can't see any more.

11:46.576 --> 11:49.176
It was an hour. An hour?

11:49.176 --> 11:53.176
Yeah, I'm sorry, mate, that's it.

11:53.176 --> 11:54.976
That is pathetic!

11:54.976 --> 11:58.856
It has come to this,
let's do the news, as I said.

11:58.856 --> 12:02.255
Right, the news. And of course we
have been off the air for a while.

12:02.255 --> 12:05.335
God, he's such a child.
Yes, where is he, anyway?

12:05.335 --> 12:09.856
I don't know, in the audience
flicking people's ears and blaming
people... Excuse me. Hi.

12:37.016 --> 12:39.496
What a man. What a man!

12:42.256 --> 12:43.416
Or...

12:43.416 --> 12:46.296
Ah!

12:46.296 --> 12:48.096
Twice on the trot!

12:48.096 --> 12:51.455
Still, never mind, Lewis,
next year, third time lucky.

12:51.455 --> 12:54.976
But why do we record this
on a Wednesday? I've no idea.

12:54.976 --> 12:57.055
If we did it on a Sunday,
we'd know by now.

12:57.055 --> 13:00.016
world. I'll tell you what,

13:00.016 --> 13:05.176
if we recorded on a Sunday, we'd
know who won Strictly Come Dancing,
and then we could tell everybody.

13:05.176 --> 13:10.816
Now, OK, there has been
a financial crisis.

13:10.816 --> 13:14.136
Is it the first time
you've heard of it?

13:14.136 --> 13:18.335
What happened in essence as far
as I could work out is
because we were off the air,

13:18.335 --> 13:22.856
everyone got bored,
so banks started lending money
they hadn't got to other banks

13:22.856 --> 13:28.095
that gave the non-existent money
to Mexicans in southern California
who couldn't pay it back.

13:28.095 --> 13:30.695
Now as a result
your cars are all worthless. Yeah.

13:30.695 --> 13:36.056
I think what I've done there
is summarised the financial crisis
quite well. You done it nicely.

13:36.056 --> 13:40.375
I was having dinner with a man.
We were talking about
the financial problems,

13:40.375 --> 13:45.015
and he said he bought a Volkswagen
Phaeton, the five-litre V10.

13:45.015 --> 13:49.736
He paid £60,000 for it, 18
months ago, just been offered 17.

13:49.736 --> 13:57.175
Ow! That's £85 a day
depreciation on a Volkswagen.
You're gonna feel that.

14:02.416 --> 14:03.776
I can beat that. Really?

14:03.776 --> 14:09.975
Yes, the Aston Martin V8 Vantage,
a nice one, £88,000, list price...

14:09.975 --> 14:12.576
We know somebody who's got one
of these, actually.

14:12.576 --> 14:15.815
Yeah, we do, it's, erm,
hang on, er...

14:15.815 --> 14:19.256
Oh, no! It's the Clarksons!
That's it, I knew somebody...

14:19.256 --> 14:22.215
I'm not going to enjoy this, am I?
No, do carry on, please.

14:22.215 --> 14:25.335
A car just like yours...
The one you've got.

14:25.335 --> 14:30.735
It was £88,000 new, with
a few extras on it, guess how much
that was worth a year later?

14:30.735 --> 14:33.856
What? £44,000.
Half its value gone.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.016
Halved its va...?
Anyone here got a V8 Vantage?

14:39.016 --> 14:43.136
Well, you're all
better off as a result.

14:43.136 --> 14:45.416
Has anybody here got a Vanquish?

14:45.416 --> 14:48.976
Here? Yeah. No, cos they're here,
James. That's very true.

14:48.976 --> 14:52.855
That's even worse, that's £175,000 -

14:52.855 --> 14:56.055
guess how much that car was worth
after 10,000 miles?

14:56.055 --> 14:57.816
Guess how much he got. No idea.

14:58.135 --> 14:59.536
£50,000.

14:59.536 --> 15:02.575
That's 125 grand in 10,000 miles!

15:02.575 --> 15:08.535
So that means if his nearest shop
is two miles away, if he pops out
for a pint of milk,

15:08.535 --> 15:10.696
that's 50 quid. Yes.

15:10.696 --> 15:13.535
£50 for a pint...?

15:13.535 --> 15:20.615
That's £50 in depreciation,
that doesn't include, you know, tyre
wear, petrol, insurance, milk...

15:20.615 --> 15:24.976
You see, I get my milk from the
back of a cow, it's much cheaper.

15:24.976 --> 15:27.296
From the back of a c...?
That's not milk.

15:27.296 --> 15:28.736
LAUGHTER

15:28.736 --> 15:30.135
Under a cow.

15:30.135 --> 15:32.816
It's not just Astons.

15:32.816 --> 15:36.175
Mercedes Benz CL 600,
the big coupe...

15:36.175 --> 15:39.416
Yes. 2004, how much do you think
it was worth then?

15:39.416 --> 15:44.976
Well it depends on a million things,
like, is it baby diarrhoea brown?

15:44.976 --> 15:46.216
No, it's black.

15:46.216 --> 15:49.696
Has it done a million miles?
No, it's done 30,000 miles.

15:49.696 --> 15:54.736
Four-year-old, they're 100 grand,
those things. About four years
ago, about 100 grand? Yep.

15:54.736 --> 15:58.575
So £100,000,
four years old, 30,000 miles,

15:58.575 --> 16:03.335
in black, with extras, 50? 55.

16:03.335 --> 16:05.776
16. 60? 16.

16:05.776 --> 16:10.055
16,000? He got £16,000 for it.
For a hundred grand car?

16:10.055 --> 16:11.896
I'd have given him a 16 and a half.

16:11.896 --> 16:13.376
I'd have gone 17.

16:13.376 --> 16:15.735
Are you watching?

16:15.735 --> 16:18.775
How do you feel now?
Yeah, you sold it cheap!

16:18.775 --> 16:21.336
I'll tell you exactly
what's happened here,

16:21.336 --> 16:26.696
Since 1993, the whole world
of flash cars has been
playing musical chairs,

16:26.696 --> 16:31.496
and the music has just stopped,
so whatever colour you've got now,
or house, that's it for life.

16:33.016 --> 16:37.376
James, bad news, the Dacia Sandero.

16:37.376 --> 16:41.616
The what? The Dacia Sandero
is not coming to the UK.

16:41.616 --> 16:42.776
Oh!

16:42.776 --> 16:44.136
AUDIENCE: Oh!

16:44.136 --> 16:46.255
Now, er, British car...

16:47.415 --> 16:51.496
British sports car makers,
heroic chaps in sheds,
they've always been able to

16:51.496 --> 16:54.816
pretty much melt your heart
with their creativity,

16:54.816 --> 17:00.776
with the fantastic swooping curves
of an E-Type Jaguar
or an Aston Martin DB7.

17:00.776 --> 17:03.176
And now, there's
a new British sports car.

17:03.176 --> 17:04.695
And here it is.

17:04.695 --> 17:05.776
Good grief!

17:05.776 --> 17:09.896
Is that a car or the shed he
built it in with some wheels?

17:09.896 --> 17:17.815
It's the Jet Stream SC250,
it costs you £30,000,
and it's made in Cornwall.

17:17.815 --> 17:19.375
Is it made out of tin?

17:19.375 --> 17:20.496
No.

17:20.496 --> 17:22.694
Clotted cream? Strawberry wheels...

17:22.694 --> 17:27.096
Does it spend every night
on Harlyn Bay trying to snog
public school girls?

17:27.096 --> 17:28.695
While smoking marijuana?

17:29.336 --> 17:34.776
None of these jokes are
working with this audience,
but they are in my house.

17:34.776 --> 17:35.695
I know what you mean! Yes.

17:35.695 --> 17:45.416
Actually, I have to say,
I do feel for the poor bloke
who's launched this,

17:45.416 --> 17:49.936
Are you saying all British sports
car manufacturers who
optimistically set up in a shed

17:49.936 --> 17:53.335
and think they can do better than
Porsche go bust? What, like TVR?

17:53.335 --> 17:54.895
Yes. Marcos? Yes.

17:54.895 --> 17:57.416
Yes. Yes. Yes.

17:59.736 --> 18:02.976
Ginetta. No!
Are Ginetta still going? They are.

18:02.976 --> 18:05.335
Well, there's hope for him yet!

18:05.335 --> 18:10.175
Erm, a really good report
in the papers this week,

18:10.175 --> 18:14.816
and in Shropshire, somebody went
to one of those speed cameras,

18:14.816 --> 18:18.016
put a tyre over it, a blanket over
the top of the whole ensemble

18:18.016 --> 18:20.616
then poured petrol on it
and set it alight.

18:20.616 --> 18:24.455
The fire brigade spokesman said
it was "a deliberate attack".

18:24.455 --> 18:31.536
Now listen, a lot of, in the current
financial crisis, a lot of people
won't be going on holiday next year

18:31.536 --> 18:35.095
to the Caribbean, or indeed
anywhere even remotely exotic.

18:35.095 --> 18:38.496
But don't worry because I think I've
come up with a solution for you.

18:38.496 --> 18:40.695
Check it out. Good grief!

18:41.815 --> 18:47.695
It's a company in the Isle of Wight
that's modified a Citroen
by fitting it with a hat. Yeah.

18:47.695 --> 18:50.535
Do you know, it cost £19,000?

18:50.535 --> 18:55.896
What's that, is that a window,
or do you sort of unzip it, climb in,
and put your head through it?

18:55.896 --> 18:58.496
Look, I've come as a Citroen!

18:58.496 --> 19:00.736
It's like one of those things
at Pontin's -

19:00.736 --> 19:04.375
go on, kids, stick your face through
the Citroen. At £19,000.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.895
For a Citroen costume!

19:06.895 --> 19:10.216
And it only has one bed. Well,
he's not gonna have a friend, is he?

19:10.216 --> 19:11.416
No.

19:11.416 --> 19:13.295
You won't need two!

19:14.696 --> 19:18.656
Lorry drivers - they're
always telling us they
have got a very hard job.

19:18.656 --> 19:24.136
As far as we can work out,
they go to work, sit down
and then go home again.

19:24.136 --> 19:25.855
Yeah. How hard can that be?

19:25.855 --> 19:31.456
To find out, the producers gave
us each £5,000 and told us to use

19:31.456 --> 19:38.416
our extensive knowledge of
lorries and lorrying to try and buy
the best trucks we could find.

19:38.416 --> 19:41.335
Then we were told to report to our
test track where we would find out

19:41.335 --> 19:44.496
what it's actually
like to be a lorryist.

19:53.935 --> 19:56.695
No, the purple one was
biscuit and raisin. No.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.695
Yes, it had little bits of biscuit
in it. The blue was the original.

19:59.695 --> 20:02.456
Blue has nothing extra.
Yes, that was. Just chocolate.

20:02.456 --> 20:04.175
And then they did the pink one,
which was only.. EH?

20:04.175 --> 20:06.376
They never did a pink one! They did.

20:06.376 --> 20:10.255
It was called It's For Girls and they
only sold it on the Isle of Man.
Not a lot of people know that.

20:11.856 --> 20:16.255
At exactly 9.14,
the lorries turned up.

20:16.255 --> 20:21.975
Brilliant. Good.

20:26.575 --> 20:33.456
Using our massive knowledge of HGVs,
we set about explaining why we bought
what we'd bought.

20:33.456 --> 20:37.175
May, which one's yours?

20:37.175 --> 20:44.656
Scania D94. This is the sleeper cab,
which has got the extra bit on
the back where you can sleep.

20:44.656 --> 20:49.456
They also did it as a day cab,
which didn't have that bit
so you couldn't sleep in it.

20:51.616 --> 20:54.256
He doesn't know anything.

20:54.256 --> 20:56.056
What colour is it, James?

20:56.056 --> 20:58.135
What have you got then? A lorry.

20:58.135 --> 20:59.816
What sort? A big one.

20:59.816 --> 21:10.135
Clearly. It's a Renault.

21:10.135 --> 21:16.816
the engine, so it has a flat floor
and that means...

21:16.816 --> 21:19.456
The floor's flat.
.. it's easier to fit the carpet.

21:19.456 --> 21:22.175
Come on, Hammond.
Show me what you've got.

21:22.175 --> 21:24.216
I have this. What is it?

21:24.216 --> 21:30.616
It's an Erf. This was hopeless. So
we resorted to our lorry crib sheets.

21:30.616 --> 21:32.056
Has yours got...

21:34.856 --> 21:36.655
Is all this just my lorry?

21:36.655 --> 21:40.136
12 litre straight six. Go.

21:40.136 --> 21:44.776
11 litres. It's not as big
but it's still pretty big.

21:44.776 --> 21:47.936
Nine litres. The thing is...

21:47.936 --> 21:49.856
Did you just buy a shed?

21:49.856 --> 21:52.816
Yours is tiny.
It is ridiculously small.

21:52.816 --> 21:55.696
That's a Caterham of the lorry
world. Right. And the point
of that is?

21:55.696 --> 21:59.296
Well, there's bound to be a speed
test. You think your lightweight
11 litre lorry...

21:59.296 --> 22:02.016
It's a Lotus lorry. Yeah.

22:05.496 --> 22:08.735
No, not that. In less developed
countries, such as Australia

22:08.735 --> 22:12.296
and America, people like to decorate
and personalise their lorries.

22:12.296 --> 22:16.856
You will now go away and do the same.

22:16.856 --> 22:19.096
I'm gonna need a hell
of a lot of paint.

22:25.256 --> 22:28.216
Once our lorries had been
redecorated, we were told to meet at

22:28.216 --> 22:32.615
Top Gear's secret Alpine
test location in Bedfordshire.

22:38.056 --> 22:42.376
Richard had tried to make his
lorry look more American by
fitting a bonnet,

22:42.376 --> 22:44.976
which was actually a dog kennel.

22:44.976 --> 22:48.456
James had gone for a gay
and friendly Indian look.

22:50.015 --> 22:56.496
And I hadn't. Damn it.

22:56.496 --> 23:00.816
So, time for the next challenge.

23:00.816 --> 23:03.576
What matters to lorry drivers?
Murdering prostitutes...

23:03.576 --> 23:06.615
And fuel economy. Load. Breakfast.

23:06.615 --> 23:12.335
You must now demonstrate
your lorry driving skills by

23:12.335 --> 23:16.296
power sliding your trucks around...

23:16.296 --> 23:18.976
I presume it is that skid pad.

23:18.976 --> 23:22.455
What is the point? You can't power
slide lorries anyway. Technically,
you can't power slide anything.

23:22.455 --> 23:29.496
To prove that it's possible you
will now watch a demonstration
by our tame racing driver.

23:29.496 --> 23:35.856
Some say that his favourite
all-time tune is Forever
Autumn by Justin Hayward

23:35.856 --> 23:40.855
and that he has the world's
largest collection of
pornographical material.

23:40.855 --> 23:46.536
All we know is, he's not The Stig
but he is The Stig's lorry-driving
cousin.

23:46.536 --> 23:53.736
# On the highway to hell
On the highway to hell...

23:53.736 --> 23:55.456
# Look, he's got the lorry
driver's suntan.

23:55.456 --> 23:56.935
Oh, sunburn. I see, yes.

23:59.735 --> 24:02.975
He's really as
big as the American Stig.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.576
Rig Stig.

24:06.935 --> 24:10.416
Rig Stig climbed into
his tuned man and set off.

24:12.736 --> 24:16.056
Look at that! That's fantastic.

24:17.855 --> 24:21.976
I love the smell of burning rubber
in the morning when it is
coming off that.

24:21.976 --> 24:24.175
That is power sliding now.

24:24.175 --> 24:25.775
He's doing a doughnut!

24:31.776 --> 24:33.256
Run for your lives!

24:39.855 --> 24:42.736
James, what do you reckon?
You can do that?

24:42.736 --> 24:45.655
Piece of cake.

24:45.655 --> 24:48.575
Gingerly, we hit the skid pan.

24:48.575 --> 24:54.055
This strip I've put here, I
can't really see where I'm going.

24:54.055 --> 25:00.576
Take the outside line
second gear high range.

25:00.576 --> 25:04.296
Power sliding is easy in a car.
Turn in, no power on.

25:07.696 --> 25:09.495
That's not gone as well as I'd hoped.

25:09.495 --> 25:11.895
Here we go. A slide.

25:11.895 --> 25:14.735
Come on, you're a racing truck.
This is what you should be good at.

25:14.735 --> 25:17.135
Oh, my bonnet ...
I've driven over my own bonnet.

25:21.976 --> 25:24.776
Left foot braking,
there's the answer.

25:27.616 --> 25:30.775
That didn't work,
so I gave it more welly.

25:30.775 --> 25:32.695
And that really didn't work. No, no!

25:38.496 --> 25:40.056
Yeah, I'll do some of that.

25:44.416 --> 25:46.776
It doesn't work.

25:46.776 --> 25:49.176
Meanwhile, in the Renault...

25:49.176 --> 25:51.735
Come on! Spin!

25:51.735 --> 25:53.576
Ow!

26:08.015 --> 26:11.816
Lorry driving, it turns out, is
quite a lot harder than I thought.

26:11.816 --> 26:16.216
Have you done something to
your leg as well? Yeah, the
gear lever's gone up my arse.

26:16.216 --> 26:21.615
After the gear lever had been
removed from Jeremy's bottom,
we moved on to the next challenge.

26:21.615 --> 26:25.015
I've lost the suspension linkages.

26:25.015 --> 26:26.616
On your leg? No, on the lorry.

26:26.616 --> 26:28.815
You will now drive to
Milbrook's High Speed Bowl.

26:28.815 --> 26:31.375
You see!
I told you there'd be a speed test.

26:31.375 --> 26:37.256
But, first, you must hitch up
a trailer and get there via the
Alpine handling course.

26:37.256 --> 26:40.215
That's hundreds of miles. No.

26:40.215 --> 26:42.415
It's here, you idiot.
It's just over there.

26:45.376 --> 26:49.455
This is where car makers test
the handling of their new models.

26:49.455 --> 26:54.295
It's also where James Bond rolled
his Aston Martin in Casino Royale.

26:56.655 --> 26:58.376
In a car, it is huge fun.

26:58.376 --> 27:00.815
In a lorry ...

27:00.815 --> 27:02.616
it probably isn't.

27:02.616 --> 27:06.855
From the moment you arrive at
the Alpine course, you have
three minutes to get round.

27:06.855 --> 27:10.936
You will also need to drive smoothly
because your trailer
is full of valuables.

27:10.936 --> 27:14.095
Valuables? Valuables?

27:14.095 --> 27:15.775
They weren't kidding.

27:17.575 --> 27:23.256
Richard's trailer contained a car
that hadn't been fastened down.

27:23.256 --> 27:26.855
Mine contained an enormous
wedding-cake.

27:28.536 --> 27:32.416
And in Jeremy's , there was
some straw, which didn't seem

27:32.416 --> 27:37.736
so bad but at the other end
there was an electric fire.

27:41.256 --> 27:44.056
First though, we had to get the
trailers attached to our lorries.

27:44.056 --> 27:47.056
Where's my truck?

27:47.056 --> 27:51.735
There's no back window.
I don't see why this needs
to be all that difficult.

27:51.735 --> 27:54.295
Which way is that now?
So I need to get that ...

27:56.375 --> 28:02.775
Hammond, being familiar with
farmyard machinery, was confident
of a quick hitch up. Easy.

28:02.775 --> 28:04.936
Us two, however ...

28:04.936 --> 28:06.496
Well, where does that go?

28:10.575 --> 28:12.895
Didn't think this would
be difficult and it's not.

28:16.656 --> 28:19.055
It's done.
The space between the cab...

28:19.055 --> 28:20.976
Yours is done?

28:20.976 --> 28:24.695
Yeah. If a lorry driver can do that,
why isn't he a brain surgeon?

28:24.695 --> 28:27.415
Scale. You know how he's finished...

28:27.415 --> 28:28.975
Hi.

28:28.975 --> 28:31.255
You're looking smug.

28:31.255 --> 28:36.856
Eventually, some men came to
help James and I, which gave
me a chance to mend my window.

28:36.856 --> 28:39.376
Why are you doing that?
Because I can't see where I'm going.

28:39.376 --> 28:41.456
Didn't you think of that when you
put it on? No.

28:43.936 --> 28:45.856
Finally, we were ready to go.

28:49.736 --> 28:51.656
Away we go.

29:00.335 --> 29:04.656
You know the, "I've done it,
I've finished" - you know that bit?

29:04.656 --> 29:06.255
Maybe the pin's broken.

29:06.255 --> 29:08.136
No.

29:08.136 --> 29:11.336
It could just be a faulty
bracket that holds the... No.

29:14.455 --> 29:16.136
OK, you're in there.

29:16.136 --> 29:19.096
Eventually,
we were ready to go again.

29:19.096 --> 29:20.776
Sorry about that.

29:20.776 --> 29:22.415
Right, we're off.

29:30.616 --> 29:33.416
Forgive me for saying this,
but how hard can it be?

29:36.816 --> 29:39.096
Can somebody bring the forklift back?

29:39.096 --> 29:41.015
So, third time lucky.

29:41.015 --> 29:42.776
This is brilliant.

29:45.136 --> 29:53.655
Oi! It was just over a mile from the
hitching point to the Alpine course,

29:53.655 --> 29:58.415
but that was enough to give
us a taste of what it's like
to be a real lorry-driver.

29:58.415 --> 30:02.776
For starters, there's
the sheer number of gears.

30:02.776 --> 30:05.856
First, into first and a half. Second.

30:05.856 --> 30:10.495
Two and a half. In a car, you can
go from 1000 rpm to seven or 8000.

30:10.495 --> 30:13.736
In this, its 1200 to 1500.

30:13.736 --> 30:16.376
And then you have to change gear.
300 revs.

30:16.376 --> 30:18.576
Get in!

30:18.576 --> 30:20.615
Get in!

30:20.615 --> 30:26.976
And when you finally reach
18th gear, you get carved up
and you have to start all over again.

30:26.976 --> 30:30.216
Now I've just been overtaken by
someone who has now slowed down.

30:30.216 --> 30:32.095
Don't stop!

30:36.696 --> 30:39.495
That's the car.
Why can't it just be...?

30:39.495 --> 30:43.695
Somebody get a move on up there. If
I have to start from the beginning
of my gears again, I'll kill myself.

30:47.136 --> 30:49.216
First, first and a half.

30:49.216 --> 30:52.896
Just let the lorry go,
always let the lorry go.

30:52.896 --> 30:59.215
Because this is a hard job and I'm
not just saying that to win favour
with lorry drivers, it's a hard job.

30:59.215 --> 31:00.815
Change gear, change gear,
change gear, check your mirrors,

31:00.815 --> 31:03.335
murder a prostitute, change
gear, change gear, murder.

31:06.976 --> 31:09.736
Still, because I'd removed some of
my stealth paint,

31:09.736 --> 31:13.015
I could at least
see where it was going. Sort of.

31:14.616 --> 31:16.616
What's that noise?

31:23.495 --> 31:27.495
Jez is making a right hash of that.
You clipped a car.

31:27.495 --> 31:29.175
Whose car?

31:29.175 --> 31:31.136
Don't know but they will notice.

31:31.136 --> 31:38.215
We then took a wrong turn
and ended up on a road where
they test vehicle suspension.

31:38.215 --> 31:42.695
That wasn't such a problem
for me in my sprung cab.

31:42.695 --> 31:44.415
But as for Hammond...

31:44.415 --> 31:47.255
I'm worried I may be
bounced out of the cab.

31:47.255 --> 31:51.536
Eventually, we arrived at the
start of the Alpine course,

31:51.536 --> 31:55.775
which also meant our
first encounter with a hill.

31:57.936 --> 32:00.055
Jeremy, you've only got two feet.

32:00.055 --> 32:03.856
Every time I come off the brake
in order to get on to the throttle,

32:03.856 --> 32:06.416
which you have to do,
it rolls backwards.

32:08.096 --> 32:09.976
About eight inches.

32:09.976 --> 32:14.216
Try using the handbrake like you
would in, oh, I don't know, a car.

32:21.295 --> 32:23.776
The twists and turns of the
Alpine course were waiting for us

32:35.376 --> 32:37.855
Get in gear! Come on. No, no.

32:41.855 --> 32:43.296
Yes!

32:44.215 --> 32:48.975
It's a drag race between
me and Captain Slow. Come on, Magnum.

32:48.975 --> 32:53.536
Oh God. Plainly, in the heat
of battle, James and Jeremy

32:53.536 --> 32:56.775
about their delicate cargoes.

32:56.775 --> 32:59.736
Clarkson's got the inside line.

32:59.736 --> 33:02.295
It's getting a bit narrow here. No.

33:06.895 --> 33:09.536
Oh Lord. Yes! I've got Slow.

33:09.536 --> 33:15.456
After my poor start, I too had
little concern for my precious load.

33:15.456 --> 33:19.456
It sounds like a charging
rhino running up and down
the trailer behind me.

33:22.576 --> 33:25.815
Back at the front, Slow
was refusing to give in.

33:25.815 --> 33:28.095
That's close.

33:30.256 --> 33:32.735
I'm going to take him here.
I've got a plan.

33:34.295 --> 33:37.455
I can't turn in that.

33:37.455 --> 33:39.495
You weren't ready for that, Slow!

33:42.456 --> 33:44.335
Down a bit of a hill. Carry some...

33:44.335 --> 33:45.935
Woah, woah!

33:53.695 --> 33:55.936
That was...
I didn't want to do what I just did.

33:55.936 --> 33:58.696
I'm in the lead!

33:58.696 --> 34:04.256
Unfortunately in all the excitement,
I forgot to change down for the steep
hill.

34:07.255 --> 34:08.936
No!

34:08.936 --> 34:11.335
No! It's dying on me. No! No! No!

34:17.135 --> 34:18.735
You! It does understeer, this lorry.

34:24.054 --> 34:26.176
Right, got to change ratios.

34:26.176 --> 34:28.216
Next box, there you go.

34:29.536 --> 34:31.534
Get a go in these things and
suddenly you start to feel just how
much power they have got to give.

34:42.215 --> 34:44.456
Yeah! Snap gear changes.

34:45.896 --> 34:51.136
Captain Clumsy had severed
my air lines and all the
brakes were jammed on.

34:51.136 --> 34:56.656
I absolutely hope James May wakes
up in the morning and 10,000
insects are in his underpants.

34:58.615 --> 35:00.016
HE LAUGHS

35:02.016 --> 35:05.855
In exactly just over three minutes,
I was the first to finish.

35:05.855 --> 35:08.735
HE LAUGHS
Now let's have a look at my cake.

35:13.295 --> 35:14.295
Ah...

35:16.215 --> 35:18.295
That's what he hit.

35:18.295 --> 35:22.376
He is the clumsiest man
in the known world.

35:22.376 --> 35:25.375
I'll just straighten it up a bit.

35:28.936 --> 35:33.456
Hammond, meanwhile, was just
crossing the finishing line.

35:33.456 --> 35:38.775
I'll be honest, I think
the headlamps, tail-lamps,
because I heard a clunk at that end,

35:38.775 --> 35:41.616
and then a clunk at that end and
then a lot more clunks

35:41.616 --> 35:44.416
and then it stopped and got smoother
and smoother.

35:44.416 --> 35:47.695
Headlights are going to be
smashed to bits. I daren't look.

35:47.695 --> 35:50.216
Yes, I know, it's bad, I'm sorry.

35:50.216 --> 35:51.495
It's worse than that.

35:52.695 --> 35:56.256
I was now on the move again
and flying.

35:56.256 --> 35:57.976
Now come on, up the hill.

36:00.336 --> 36:02.016
Is that bad for my points?

36:02.016 --> 36:03.616
Yeah.

36:03.616 --> 36:05.376
More to the point, where is it?

36:06.215 --> 36:07.656
I don't know.

36:07.656 --> 36:09.416
Then Jeremy arrived.

36:11.215 --> 36:12.855
Fire!

36:12.855 --> 36:14.536
You're on fire!

36:14.536 --> 36:18.456
Have we got the next challenge,
lads? How can we be this rubbish?

36:22.135 --> 36:25.416
This is totally...
So, anyway, how was your car?

36:25.416 --> 36:27.856
Car's interesting. Stolen.

36:27.856 --> 36:31.256
That's what it is, I've just
thought of it now, stolen.

36:31.256 --> 36:34.856
The damnedest thing.
That is actually quite bad now.

36:34.856 --> 36:37.495
It is, that's on fire.

36:37.495 --> 36:39.016
Yeah.

36:39.016 --> 36:40.495
APPLAUSE

36:45.016 --> 36:50.176
OK, we're going to put that out
and pick it up later on,

36:50.176 --> 36:54.016
but now...now we've got to move on.

36:54.016 --> 36:57.056
My guest tonight is from Yorkshire.

36:57.056 --> 36:58.656
CHEERING

36:58.656 --> 37:03.735
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome our Star In The
Reasonably Priced - my arse,

37:03.735 --> 37:08.095
it cost a fortune, that thing! -
Car, Sir Michael Parkinson.

37:12.135 --> 37:15.015
How are you?

37:15.015 --> 37:18.575
CHEERING
A legend has come among us.

37:18.575 --> 37:20.215
Have a seat.

37:20.215 --> 37:24.375
Have a seat.
APPLAUSE CONTINUES

37:26.616 --> 37:31.456
I'm a bit nervous about this one.
I bet you are(!) When was the last
time you were nervous?

37:31.456 --> 37:36.776
Well, the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the
interview world is setting
being interviewed by young Luke.

37:36.776 --> 37:39.576
It's easier being interviewed,
let me tell you.

37:39.576 --> 37:43.976
I don't know about that. You've
obviously never interviewed yourself.

37:43.976 --> 37:48.175
It's the funniest thing, when I said
you were from Yorkshire there - did
you hear? -

37:48.175 --> 37:49.855
everyone was like, "Wah-hay!"

37:49.855 --> 37:54.415
Well, not everyone, but you don't get
that with Nottinghamshire?
Nor Leicestershire.

37:54.415 --> 37:57.775
Our guest tonight
is from Leicestershire.
SOMEONE BOOS

37:57.775 --> 38:02.216
Are you still proud
of being a Yorkshireman?
I love being a Yorkshireman.

38:02.216 --> 38:04.896
Why do you live in Maidenhead?

38:04.896 --> 38:09.295
The same reason you live
down here - because the BBC
isn't up in Yorkshire.

38:09.295 --> 38:12.495
If the BBC was in Doncaster,
I might never have moved.

38:12.495 --> 38:15.295
I think I might.
LAUGHTER

38:15.295 --> 38:19.016
It's that sort of
whole Yorkshire thing.

38:19.016 --> 38:22.615
We could do it for hours, "Oh, my
dad were poorer than your dad."

38:22.615 --> 38:25.176
It's a Monty Python sketch.
It is, absolutely.

38:25.176 --> 38:29.935
"My dad, 14 years old,
left school, bronchitis, consumption,

38:29.935 --> 38:33.376
"diphtheria, got a job as a butcher's
boy, worked 27 hour a day,

38:33.376 --> 38:36.456
"and paid butcher for permission
to come to work," etc.

38:36.456 --> 38:39.576
But your dad was the same,
from what I hear? He was a miner.

38:39.576 --> 38:41.256
He loved being a Yorkshireman.

38:41.256 --> 38:45.576
He was very proud of being
a Yorkshireman. And he said

38:45.576 --> 38:48.455
I'd been doing
the talk show for about 10 years -

38:48.455 --> 38:50.816
he said "You've had a good time,
eh, lad?"

38:50.816 --> 38:53.815
I said, "I've had a wonderful time."
"Made a bob or two?"

38:53.815 --> 38:59.336
I said, "I have." "And you've met
all them lovely birds and all that
stuff." I said, "I have."

38:59.336 --> 39:04.855
He said, "Think on, though, good as
that might be, it's not like playing
for Yorkshire at cricket, is it?"

39:04.855 --> 39:08.495
And of course, in his view, that
defined immortality, not fame.

39:08.495 --> 39:11.816
Anybody who's appeared on
television is merely famous.

39:11.816 --> 39:16.175
Those days, if you've played
for Yorkshire, wore the white rose,
you're immortal.

39:16.175 --> 39:18.375
He walked, didn't he,
to go and see them?

39:18.375 --> 39:22.095
No, his grandad...his father,
my grandad, walked to Leeds.

39:22.095 --> 39:25.095
From Barnsley?
From Barnsley. Which is 30 miles.

39:25.095 --> 39:29.576
It was, but he only left the village
once in his entire lifetime
to go to the seaside.

39:29.856 --> 39:31.656
Now, my granny, when she died,

39:31.656 --> 39:35.296
she'd never set foot outside
the borough of Doncaster.

39:35.296 --> 39:41.016
By gum. I don't know. Never once.
My father was 66 or seven

39:41.016 --> 39:43.615
before he went on an aeroplane.

39:43.615 --> 39:49.176
And when I got a bit of money, we
decided we'd send him and my mother,

39:49.176 --> 39:51.296
she'd never been away before,
on an aeroplane.

39:51.296 --> 39:55.175
So we arrived at British Airways and
we were going to fly them off,
first class, look after him.

39:55.175 --> 39:58.656
Right, when they came back two weeks
later I said, "What's the matter?"

39:58.656 --> 40:00.736
She said, "Your father, it's silly.

40:00.736 --> 40:02.735
"He just lets me down."

40:02.735 --> 40:04.335
I said, "What's the story?
Calm down."

40:04.335 --> 40:07.175
She said, "We got on the airplane,
as soon as we left, this nice

40:07.175 --> 40:11.935
young man came along and said,
'Would you like a drink?' He said
'Yes, I'd like a pint of bitter.'"

40:11.935 --> 40:15.176
First class? First class.

40:15.176 --> 40:19.936
They said, "Sorry, we don't
serve bitter, Mr Parkinson, on
this airplane." "Don't serve bitter?

40:19.936 --> 40:22.176
"What kind of plane is this?" The
man said, "But you don't understand.

40:22.176 --> 40:25.455
"Champagne?"
"I can't afford champagne."

40:25.455 --> 40:28.816
The man said, "No, you don't
understand, Mr Parkinson,
it's free." "Free?"

40:28.816 --> 40:30.775
says my old man, "Bring it on."

40:30.775 --> 40:34.575
My mother said, "Do you know,"
she said, "he got so drunk

40:34.575 --> 40:38.376
"that after his meal he offered
to wash up."

40:38.376 --> 40:40.416
Seriously?

40:40.416 --> 40:42.136
That's wonderful.

40:42.136 --> 40:48.576
Now I know and respect you,
more actually than a chat
show, as a journalist.

40:48.576 --> 40:52.455
That's where you began, on the local
newspapers in Mexborough, wasn't it?

40:52.455 --> 40:56.695
Actually, I was a district man.
I covered a nest of pit villages

40:56.695 --> 40:59.536
in Royston and Cuddeth
and all round there.

40:59.536 --> 41:05.895
Do you think that sets you up,
being a hack, for being the
chat show legend that you became?

41:05.895 --> 41:08.616
Everything I've ever done
has been informed by that

41:08.616 --> 41:11.055
training that I did, by the
apprenticeship that I served.

41:11.055 --> 41:14.976
When I look back of my life,
writing my autobiography
as I have been doing, I've been

41:14.976 --> 41:18.375
amazed that there is a common thread
through it, and that's journalism.

41:18.375 --> 41:23.855
It's my love of journalism,
it's the fascination I had for
the job and still have for the job.

41:23.855 --> 41:28.015
Now the chat show now, obviously
this week, there's all sorts of

41:28.015 --> 41:30.056
issues around chat shows,
but let's put it this way.

41:30.056 --> 41:36.256
There are fewer chat shows
on the television now than
there were last week. This is true.

41:36.256 --> 41:43.576
Do you think, leaving that aside,
that it's kind of had its day now?

41:43.576 --> 41:45.735
No, I don't think it's had its day.

41:45.735 --> 41:49.056
I think that the people
who run television decided

41:49.056 --> 41:53.496
that the conversational kind of chat
show which we're having now, which
my show is based on, that's gone.

41:53.496 --> 41:56.775
I reckon they think
that's as dead as a dodo.

41:56.775 --> 42:02.415
And the only way it's going to
survive in their mind is by doing
the show that Jonathan does or...

42:02.415 --> 42:05.215
Did.
LAUGHTER

42:05.215 --> 42:10.816
It's a show based on comedy, with a
guy who's happy to play a major part

42:10.816 --> 42:13.536
in it, which is the antithesis,
really, of doing an interview.

42:13.536 --> 42:16.696
If you do an interview,
you the interviewer, subjugate
yourself to allow that other person

42:16.696 --> 42:20.015
in front of you
to actually blossom if possible.

42:20.015 --> 42:26.336
Don't you think that these days,
let's say when you left to show,
finished recording, if the guests

42:26.336 --> 42:31.735
hadn't been very interesting,
it was kind of their fault and their
problem. I never took that view.

42:31.735 --> 42:34.615
I always thought if it was
a bad interview it was my fault.

42:34.615 --> 42:36.615
Really? Without a doubt.
So Meg Ryan...?

42:36.615 --> 42:41.176
Meg Ryan was my fault.
No, Meg Ryan wasn't an interview,
it was a car crash, for God's sake!

42:41.176 --> 42:46.416
And of course when that happened
with her, and God knows why she was
in that kind of mood, I don't know,

42:46.416 --> 42:51.415
but the fact of the matter is, the
drama of it, the discomfort of it,
is what they love to see.

42:51.415 --> 42:53.695
They love to see the host
getting it in the neck like that.

42:53.695 --> 42:55.695
It's kill the quarterback time. You?

42:55.695 --> 42:58.135
Yeah. But you don't think
it was your fault?

42:58.135 --> 43:01.816
It wasn't my fault, no,
but I was responsible for it

43:01.816 --> 43:04.696
and I could have handled it
differently.

43:04.696 --> 43:07.296
Really? I think so.

43:07.296 --> 43:10.695
When I said to her,
"You've been a journalist,
what should I do now?"

43:10.695 --> 43:12.696
She said, "Wrap it up." I didn't.

43:12.696 --> 43:14.735
LAUGHTER

43:14.735 --> 43:17.016
Because these days, people in
the public eye, you might

43:17.016 --> 43:22.615
call them celebrities, they get
every aspect of their lives turned
over every day by Heat magazine and

43:22.615 --> 43:27.215
the tabloid newspapers and so on
and they don't have much to give
and actually don't want to give.

43:27.215 --> 43:31.296
The only way you'll get
people half the time to come

43:31.296 --> 43:33.976
Which is, sorry to ask this,

43:33.976 --> 43:38.055
but how did you deal with the you've
got to... Get rid of it up top.

43:38.055 --> 43:41.175
Get rid of the plugging up top?
Get it in the intro.

43:42.736 --> 43:47.095
I wondered when this might happen.
I'm trying to think of a... this.

43:47.095 --> 43:50.216
What you do, you do an intro.

43:50.216 --> 43:54.576
You do an intro? It's a bit
late now, I've done the intro.

43:54.576 --> 43:57.455
Then wait for me to say,
"What is that you have there?"

43:57.455 --> 44:01.816
I'll tell you what it is, Michael,
it's your CD. Thank you.

44:01.816 --> 44:05.576
What's it called, Jeremy?
It's called My Life In Music.

44:05.576 --> 44:09.535
And what's it about?
Well, I tell you what...
LAUGHTER

44:09.535 --> 44:14.136
You see, this is literally
the master I'm learning from here.

44:14.136 --> 44:17.296
It's the music that was
on the show and on my radio show

44:17.296 --> 44:21.735
and it's some of the people,
all the people we had on the show.

44:21.735 --> 44:25.536
And it's also people we discovered -
Michael Buble and people like that.

44:25.536 --> 44:27.616
It reflects my love of music,
the other thing

44:27.616 --> 44:31.496
you would know about Yorkshire
is the tradition of music there.

44:31.496 --> 44:34.376
There isn't one brass band on here.
There's a big band.

44:34.376 --> 44:36.535
Can we just move it on
to cars, if you don't mind?

44:36.535 --> 44:39.376
Was that OK? Very smooth segue.

44:39.376 --> 44:41.575
I see you as a Jag man.

44:41.575 --> 44:44.136
I've had a Jag or two.

44:44.136 --> 44:46.735
I've got a Merc at present.
Which one? S500.

44:46.735 --> 44:51.496
That's worth about a tenner.
LAUGHTER

44:51.496 --> 44:55.735
Why did you switch to the Merc?
I felt like it. They've got
more room in the back, too.

44:55.735 --> 44:58.336
I've got a driver now. Oh, driver.

44:58.336 --> 45:01.296
What would your dad say?
I don't like driving.

45:01.296 --> 45:04.015
Do you not? No, it's boring,
For Christ's sake, it's awful.

45:04.015 --> 45:07.495
It's really, really boring.

45:07.495 --> 45:09.336
This is a man who likes cricket.

45:11.136 --> 45:13.176
I like being driven to cricket.

45:13.176 --> 45:18.575
Now, look, your lap,
you're here obviously to drive
a reasonably priced car.

45:18.575 --> 45:22.296
Now then, how did we do?
Well, you're 73 years old now.

45:22.296 --> 45:25.856
Most people at your age are
watching Strictly Come Dancing.

45:25.856 --> 45:26.896
LAUGHTER

45:29.175 --> 45:31.255
Shall we have a look at the lap?
Play the tape.

45:36.696 --> 45:41.375
Start scared and end up wanting
to be like the Stig, stay down here.

45:41.375 --> 45:45.775
You're mumbling, that a man at
peace with himself, when he mumbles.

45:46.856 --> 45:50.736
A tidy line through there,
got to be honest. Very tidy.

45:54.456 --> 45:58.816
Can't see anything wrong with that.
Look at that. That's not bad at all.

45:58.816 --> 46:01.896
A big, curly bend.

46:01.896 --> 46:05.255
Curly bend?
This is the world-famous Hammerhead.

46:05.255 --> 46:07.696
And you are doing it...

46:07.696 --> 46:11.455
Well, about as perfectly
as I've ever... There you are.

46:11.455 --> 46:14.296
Here we go, flat through here.

46:14.296 --> 46:17.496
Oh, yeah. And across the skiddy bit.
I love these two bits.

46:17.496 --> 46:21.575
Whee! Close to the tyres,
he moved the tyres!

46:23.976 --> 46:28.056
Look at that, you've got the second
to last corner worked out nicely.

46:28.056 --> 46:32.056
We're in 16 by 9 as we go
across the line. And there we are.

46:32.056 --> 46:33.655
CHEERING

46:42.095 --> 46:46.816
More fun than Meg Ryan?
Much more, most fun I've ever
had on television. Really?

46:46.816 --> 46:52.096
Yeah. So here we are, here are the
people, all of whom you will have
met, I'm sure and interviewed. Yes.

46:52.096 --> 46:54.855
Where do you think
you might have come?

46:54.855 --> 47:00.536
Well, I think bottom half, I think
between Ray Winstone and Alan Carr.
No.

47:00.536 --> 47:02.896
No? Higher? Oh, yeah.

47:02.896 --> 47:05.776
Did I beat Billie Piper?

47:05.776 --> 47:07.855
Did you beat Billie Piper?
And James Blunt?

47:07.855 --> 47:09.696
No, I'll tell you what you did.

47:11.296 --> 47:12.976
A...

47:14.055 --> 47:18.295
1:49:4

47:18.295 --> 47:20.295
and that means you are

47:21.895 --> 47:23.496
there.

47:29.175 --> 47:32.775
Quicker than Ronnie Wood.
I've beaten your great hero,
Michael Gambon.

47:32.775 --> 47:34.495
You never interviewed him, did you?

47:34.495 --> 47:37.576
He wouldn't do it. He did it
for you. We've had him twice.

47:37.576 --> 47:41.335
I know you have. Mind you,
I tell you what, in the absence of

47:41.335 --> 47:43.936
a chat show on BBC One
for the forthcoming few weeks,

47:43.936 --> 47:46.455
you should see our guest list
for the rest of the year!

47:46.455 --> 47:49.256
Michael, it's been an absolute joy.

47:49.256 --> 47:52.896
I'm nervous as hell all the way
through but you've been a superstar.

47:52.896 --> 47:55.495
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sir Michael Parkinson.

47:55.495 --> 47:57.816
CHEERING

48:04.495 --> 48:08.296
Now, earlier, the three of us
had used

48:08.296 --> 48:13.776
our extensive knowledge of lorrying
to buy HGVs and it wasn't going well.

48:13.776 --> 48:19.496
especially for Jeremy,
who'd ended up with a gear lever in
his bottom and his truck on fire.

48:19.496 --> 48:22.656
Still, we rejoin the action
after we'd addressed those issues.

48:24.256 --> 48:27.335
My lorry was in a pretty poor state.

48:27.335 --> 48:32.095
Despite this, the producers threw us
straight into the next challenge.

48:32.095 --> 48:35.335
"Since you've now had
some practice at lorrying,

48:35.335 --> 48:37.615
and you are coming on well..."

48:37.615 --> 48:40.336
I think we are. I'm not.

48:40.336 --> 48:44.055
"We shall now see
whose lorry is the fastest.

48:44.055 --> 48:47.056
"To do this, you will have
to take the limiters off."

48:47.056 --> 48:50.856
I was going to say, they're
all limited to 56, aren't they?

48:50.856 --> 48:55.216
Half an hour later,
the limiters had been deactivated.

48:55.216 --> 49:00.496
I'm going to drive this ruined,
ancient, burned lorry around here

49:00.496 --> 49:04.695
faster than Her Majesty's
government deem to be safe.

49:06.016 --> 49:11.496
The venue for this hairbrain test
was the fearsome two-mile bowl.

49:11.496 --> 49:16.455
But Hammond, in his Caterer
was relishing the challenge.

49:16.455 --> 49:19.255
This is my sports trucks territory!

49:19.255 --> 49:25.015
However, my lightened convertible
Magnum wasn't hanging around either.

49:25.015 --> 49:31.936
My 12-litre Magnum
has splashed the 9-litre Scalia
and splashed it enormously!

49:33.815 --> 49:36.535
I'm doing 60. Eat my Magnum!

49:36.535 --> 49:37.656
Yeah!

49:37.656 --> 49:41.816
Things were less exciting
in James's world.

49:41.816 --> 49:44.496
59 1/2 miles an hour.

49:46.496 --> 49:48.695
'I was staggered by
the speed of my Magnum!'

49:48.695 --> 49:52.456
I'm going 70 miles an hour
in a lorry!

49:52.456 --> 49:56.295
But then, Hammond found another gear.

49:56.295 --> 49:58.735
Ha!

49:58.735 --> 50:01.496
I'm on the way to 75 now.

50:01.496 --> 50:04.935
So my lorry is, what's the word?

50:04.935 --> 50:08.935
It's faster, your GTI lorry is quick.

50:12.055 --> 50:16.855
We continue to pound round until
eventually we hit our top speeds.

50:16.855 --> 50:18.695
80 miles an hour!

50:18.695 --> 50:21.416
64.6.

50:21.416 --> 50:24.095
Hammond, though, was touching 90.

50:24.095 --> 50:25.696
Yeah, thank you!

50:25.696 --> 50:30.335
But then we received instructions
that we had to stop.

50:31.656 --> 50:36.736
Oh, cock! The cameramen
retreated to a safe distance.

50:39.256 --> 50:43.575
Brake too gently you won't pull up,
brake too hard, you'll lock up

50:43.575 --> 50:46.895
the trailer's rear wheels,
you'll jack-knife and roll.

50:46.895 --> 50:49.576
Well, I'd rather not
do either of those.

50:49.576 --> 50:55.696
In fact, James discovered
there is a terrifying
third way of stopping a big lorry.

51:02.975 --> 51:05.295
Was it really that frightening?

51:05.295 --> 51:08.295
Yes. We've got another challenge.

51:08.295 --> 51:12.735
I'm not interested. No, you will be.

51:12.735 --> 51:15.616
It says, "You now have
to do a hill start.

51:15.616 --> 51:18.295
"This is a test of driving
precision."

51:18.295 --> 51:24.375
It is, James, you've got to balance
your handbrake, you clutch, your
throttle. You love all that stuff.

51:24.375 --> 51:26.415
Yeah, precision.

51:26.415 --> 51:30.575
And it says "The winner will
receive a year's supply of
gentlemen's literature."

51:32.896 --> 51:35.856
FLUSHING

51:36.736 --> 51:39.056
We're back. We're back as a team.

51:39.056 --> 51:44.856
The literature in question
was all very exciting,
but the hill start was even better.

51:44.856 --> 51:49.015
Our trucks would be placed on a
slope and then, to focus our minds,

51:49.015 --> 51:52.056
items close to our hearts
would be placed behind them.

51:52.056 --> 51:55.896
In Jeremy's case,
we went for his beloved drum-kit.

51:55.896 --> 52:00.175
Are you scared? On the drums,
Jeremy Clarkson's lorry.

52:00.175 --> 52:01.975
Very much on the drums.

52:01.975 --> 52:04.096
I'm very fond of my drum-kit.
Drum roll...

52:04.096 --> 52:05.736
Backwards down the hill!

52:05.736 --> 52:07.975
Shut up.

52:07.975 --> 52:10.215
Mirror. I think he's
taking it very seriously.

52:10.215 --> 52:13.095
Come on. Get on with it, Clarkson!

52:13.095 --> 52:20.376
'The fate of my drum-kit rested
on me being strong enough to
engage the Renault's crawler gear.'

52:20.376 --> 52:23.015
This is it. The moment.

52:24.216 --> 52:27.055
Aw... Aw...

52:27.055 --> 52:32.775
The one thing the Renault Magnum
can do is a hill-start.

52:32.775 --> 52:35.375
Now, we're not petty, but...

52:41.655 --> 52:43.775
He just clipped it on the way back.

52:43.775 --> 52:47.375
Mate, so close.
I know, you must have...

52:47.375 --> 52:49.176
It never moved an inch.

52:49.176 --> 52:51.576
You've smashed my drum-kit up.

52:51.576 --> 52:53.695
You've smashed my drum-kit up!

52:56.455 --> 53:04.176
'Never mind, Hammond was next and
I would strike down upon him with
great vengeance and furious anger.'

53:04.176 --> 53:06.216
I think he's going to
be quite cross with us.

53:06.216 --> 53:10.776
Have you seen what he's
done to the number plate?

53:10.776 --> 53:13.935
Oh, for God's sake.
Personal plates. He is such a pikey.

53:13.935 --> 53:17.616
No! Well, it was your dog or that.

53:17.616 --> 53:21.015
Evil BLEEP!

53:21.015 --> 53:24.935
My lorry didn't have a crawler gear.

53:24.935 --> 53:27.816
Ooh! Ah...!

53:32.335 --> 53:35.056
Do you want to use it as a chock?

53:35.056 --> 53:37.015
No! I can't do it!

53:37.015 --> 53:38.536
Do you want to give in?

53:38.536 --> 53:40.775
Yes. OK, he's giving in.

53:40.775 --> 53:43.255
May, it's your turn.

53:43.255 --> 53:47.335
Thanks to James's extended lavatory
break, it was now getting dark.

53:47.335 --> 53:50.016
But there was no
way we were going to stop.

53:50.016 --> 53:55.295
We've been round to James's house and
we've relieved him of his prized
grand piano. Are you joking?

53:55.295 --> 54:00.415
No. Sadly though, even before the
test began, there was an issue.

54:04.776 --> 54:08.976
Don't film that. Just don't film.
Let's film something over here.

54:08.976 --> 54:12.416
What's more, our repair
job wasn't brilliant.

54:12.416 --> 54:19.776
When he finds that his precious
piano is propped up by a mountain of
pornography, he is going to go ape.

54:19.776 --> 54:22.176
OK, May, let it rock.

54:24.376 --> 54:29.296
He'll be very good at this.
He likes this sort of thing.
See look, feeling the power.

54:29.296 --> 54:31.015
Jeremy...

54:38.855 --> 54:40.936
Run. Yes, run away.

54:40.936 --> 54:44.176
Keep the porn! You can have that.

54:44.176 --> 54:47.575
'We hoped that would be that,
but no.'

54:47.575 --> 54:54.336
The producers said we had to meet up
at the Top Gear test track the next
day for one final challenge.

54:56.335 --> 55:01.855
It says, "This is a test of speed,
braking and toughness all and one.

55:01.855 --> 55:08.176
"You must accelerate to 56 miles an
hour, drive through an obstacle and
then stop as quickly as possible.

55:08.176 --> 55:14.575
"Whoever does that in the
shortest distance will win
a year's supply of pies."

55:14.575 --> 55:17.335
What do they mean by obstacle?

55:18.936 --> 55:20.376
Doesn't say.

55:22.296 --> 55:23.855
What sort of pies?

55:23.855 --> 55:28.856
We really did have no idea
what sort of obstacles
we'd be driving through.

55:28.856 --> 55:32.135
But we could see the windscreens
were being heavily fortified

55:32.135 --> 55:35.376
with mesh,
so it probably wouldn't be balloons.

55:37.575 --> 55:42.536
And so, with a sense of trepidation,
I lined up on the start line
and set off.

55:45.536 --> 55:49.936
30, 35, come on.

55:49.936 --> 55:54.415
I bet Hammond's pissing himself,
but think of his book's sales.
They're massive.

55:54.415 --> 55:58.896
Come on, build, build, build.
He hasn't got long to write it.

56:02.416 --> 56:04.096
Here we go. This might hurt.

56:30.016 --> 56:34.216
My truck had taken a wallop,
but the distance covered
was extremely short.

56:34.216 --> 56:36.656
This annoyed my colleagues.

56:38.496 --> 56:40.975
I don't think that's fair. What?

56:40.975 --> 56:43.735
Well, he had a huge structure
that will have slowed him down,

56:43.735 --> 56:46.856
so therefore his stopping
difference will have been less.

56:46.856 --> 56:51.616
So if my obstacle is very solid,
I'll just stop. And you'll win.
You'll be killed, but you'll win.

56:51.616 --> 56:56.135
It hardly slowed me.
Rubbish! No, I needed...

56:56.135 --> 57:00.176
Rubbish, you were barely moving
coming out of the other side of that.

57:00.176 --> 57:05.095
Hoping for a more solid impact
than Hammond's, I began to roll.

57:05.095 --> 57:08.295
Oh, my Lord. I'm glad I'm not
in his lorry now.

57:08.295 --> 57:09.616
Here it comes.

57:18.216 --> 57:20.335
Bracing, bracing.

57:34.376 --> 57:37.375
After the crash,
my friends were deeply concerned.

57:37.375 --> 57:40.616
He's woken up stuck in a
lorry cab with five firemen.

57:44.176 --> 57:47.336
Sadly, my lorry had travelled 40
yards further than the airfield,

57:47.336 --> 57:51.616
even though I'd taken out
600 office water coolers.

57:51.616 --> 57:56.215
If you were going to have a meeting
in an office somewhere, I'm sorry,
I've just spoiled it for you.

57:56.215 --> 57:57.856
Here we go.

57:57.856 --> 58:01.415
So now, only the mighty
Magnum could beat Hammond.

58:01.415 --> 58:03.415
This isn't fair.

58:03.415 --> 58:06.496
That'll slow him much
better than my stupid building.

58:14.535 --> 58:16.536
Have we had lunch?

58:19.695 --> 58:21.015
Hard down...

58:21.015 --> 58:22.575
Here we go!

58:37.615 --> 58:38.895
Ah!

58:38.895 --> 58:40.576
Ah!

58:40.576 --> 58:42.255
Ah!

58:42.255 --> 58:48.056
'The impact was a bit nasty,
but before seeking medical attention,
there was some arguing to be done.'

58:48.056 --> 58:52.736
You may have beaten me there, and
if you did that's just because you
had a better obstacle than I had.

58:52.736 --> 58:56.095
Rubbish! You had a brick wall, I had
wooden walls. Measure it. Let's
measure it.

58:56.095 --> 58:58.735
I tell you, I promise you...

58:58.735 --> 59:01.615
Ow, this actually really hurts.

59:06.016 --> 59:10.935
See, how many lorries are trashed
on that Strictly Come Dancing
thing? None.

59:10.935 --> 59:17.815
Now, we should explain, the impact
that I had there was pretty severe.

59:17.815 --> 59:23.176
My ankle burst where the
clutch pedal went through it,
my head was dislodged from my spine.

59:23.176 --> 59:26.775
And really, we've ended
up with a Top Gear top tip.

59:26.775 --> 59:30.376
If you are a lorryist and you're
going to have an accident

59:30.376 --> 59:34.336
and there's a choice of something
to hit, avoid anything with bricks
in it.

59:34.336 --> 59:38.456
Always swerve and go for the
big pile of mineral water.
Yes, that's a safer bet.

59:38.456 --> 59:40.416
Anyway, we have done a scoreboard.

59:40.416 --> 59:44.376
It's hopeless to be honest
and massively complicated,

59:44.376 --> 59:46.576
but the upshot of it is this...

59:46.576 --> 59:49.615
I got 60 points.

59:49.615 --> 59:54.695
Hammond, you got minus 25.

59:54.695 --> 59:57.056
And Jeremy, you got...

59:57.056 --> 01:00:02.976
A gear lever in his bottom. A gear
lever in his bottom and minus 3,560.

01:00:06.856 --> 01:00:10.135
Why did I get that? You just did.

01:00:10.135 --> 01:00:11.856
Whatever. We have proved...

01:00:11.856 --> 01:00:13.815
we have proved

01:00:13.815 --> 01:00:19.336
that the Scania P94D
is the best truck in Britain today.

01:00:19.336 --> 01:00:23.856
And next week we have more lorries
on, in fact, because we've been to
America to test some muscle cars.

01:00:23.856 --> 01:00:26.375
So we'll see you then,
unless of course

01:00:26.375 --> 01:00:30.056
you're all watching the sequinned
has-beens on the other side.

01:00:30.056 --> 01:00:31.456
Take care, good night.

01:00:37.936 --> 01:00:41.016
