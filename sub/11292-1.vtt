00:38.931 --> 00:40.633
Make a wish.

00:40.666 --> 00:41.867
You got one?

00:41.901 --> 00:47.574
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Ready?

00:47.606 --> 00:48.674
Yes.

00:53.045 --> 00:55.948
So, we are almost at Joshua Tree

00:55.981 --> 01:00.754
and the excitement level
in the car is off the charts.

01:00.787 --> 01:02.055
Right, guys?

01:04.090 --> 01:06.892
Yep. Off the charts.

01:06.925 --> 01:10.963
And I probably shouldn't
be filming this while driving.

01:10.996 --> 01:14.668
So, Megan, any last words?

01:21.808 --> 01:23.043
Wait a second.

01:25.945 --> 01:27.881
No, no, no.

01:32.385 --> 01:37.958
<i>I'm always chasing rainbows</i>

01:40.225 --> 01:47.633
<i>Waiting to find
a little bluebird</i>

01:47.666 --> 01:51.605
<i>In vain</i>

02:58.137 --> 03:01.074
Locate Fila virus survivors.

03:01.107 --> 03:07.681
Administer mosquito.
Red retrieve. Black leave.

03:07.714 --> 03:10.450
Locate Fila virus survivors.

03:10.482 --> 03:17.189
Administer mosquito.
Red retrieve. Black leave.

03:17.222 --> 03:20.893
Locate Fila virus survivors.

03:20.927 --> 03:26.900
Administer mosquito.
Red retrieve. Black leave.

03:26.901 --> 03:29.190
<i>Subrip:
Pix</i>

03:29.191 --> 03:34.086
<b>PANDEMIC</b>

03:34.506 --> 03:37.076
<i>So, you deploy in seven.</i>

03:38.276 --> 03:40.746
Your team has to be en route
by first light,

03:40.780 --> 03:42.482
- so we have to do a rapid fire brief.
- Yes, sir.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.883
Well, everything in the command
is coded by uniform.

03:44.917 --> 03:46.986
The navigators wear green.
The drivers wear gray.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.788
The gunners are camo.
The doctors are in tan.

03:49.822 --> 03:51.057
There's one of each
on every team.

03:51.089 --> 03:54.827
Now, you've been
assigned Unit 730-A.

03:54.861 --> 03:57.062
Say hello to your
new best friend.

03:57.095 --> 03:58.931
It's time to suit up.

04:04.936 --> 04:08.774
So, have you...

04:08.808 --> 04:10.110
Have you seen what's out there?

04:10.142 --> 04:13.880
- I mean outside the gate?
- Not lately.

04:13.913 --> 04:16.216
I have a rational fear of dying.

04:16.248 --> 04:18.317
What's been happening
is that the extraction teams

04:18.351 --> 04:20.853
have been bringing back the
infected with the uninfecteds.

04:20.887 --> 04:24.224
So, we've embedded a doctor with each
team to do the testing in the field,

04:24.257 --> 04:27.861
because one slip up could
bring the whole compound down.

04:27.894 --> 04:32.966
So, the doctor's job, your job, is
to make sure that doesn't happen.

04:32.998 --> 04:37.169
This goes up and over.

04:37.202 --> 04:38.772
How's it feel?

04:45.277 --> 04:47.112
Heavy.

04:47.146 --> 04:50.049
We received this transmission
from Dr. Ward.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.918
<i>Control, this is Dr. Ward.</i>

04:51.950 --> 04:55.320
<i>We came across 98 uninfected
at Saint Mary's supply drop.</i>

04:55.353 --> 04:58.390
<i>Forty=six are accompanying us.
We need to send...</i>

04:58.423 --> 05:01.471
And it just cuts out.
No more communication.

05:01.472 --> 05:02.995
We don't know where Ward is.

05:03.029 --> 05:07.332
Now, we presume that the remaining
52 uninfected are barricaded

05:07.365 --> 05:09.902
inside Saint Mary's
prep downtown.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.570
Your mission
is to get down there,

05:11.603 --> 05:14.841
retrieve this virus and bring
it back to the compound.

05:14.873 --> 05:16.909
You'll be with Team 314.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.978
- The navigator'll have the details.
- Yes, sir.

05:19.010 --> 05:22.047
Okay, here's a geographic illustration
of where the virus started.

05:25.284 --> 05:30.055
And here's where we are now.
I'll take that back.

05:30.089 --> 05:33.059
Okay, so the camera
stays on at all times.

05:33.091 --> 05:36.228
The information we've recorded has
been invaluable in the fight.

05:36.262 --> 05:39.199
I'm gonna check your kit, okay?

05:39.231 --> 05:40.999
You don't need this.

05:41.033 --> 05:43.102
All communication will be
through the suit transmitter.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.971
Sir, in New York
we took extra phones.

05:45.003 --> 05:47.974
No exceptions.
Understood, doctor?

05:48.007 --> 05:48.908
Yes, sir.

05:48.909 --> 05:51.611
Great. Okay. Stay here.
We're gonna check the seal.

05:51.644 --> 05:53.980
You have three minutes
till departure.

05:57.082 --> 06:00.085
All right,
raise your hands and rotate.

06:07.026 --> 06:09.896
Clear.
Light and radio check.

06:09.928 --> 06:11.196
Night vision activated.

06:11.229 --> 06:13.031
Helmet light?

06:13.065 --> 06:14.834
No, right side.

06:15.935 --> 06:17.404
Helmet light off.

06:18.471 --> 06:20.139
And radio?

06:20.171 --> 06:23.075
<i>Left, right. Left right.</i>

06:23.108 --> 06:25.043
Radio is functional.

06:25.077 --> 06:27.312
That building over there,
that's Quarantine A.

06:27.346 --> 06:30.283
When you return, the survivors
are brought there for isolation.

06:30.315 --> 06:32.217
What's in there?

06:32.250 --> 06:35.020
That's where you bring the survivors.
That's all you need to know.

06:35.053 --> 06:38.123
This is Quarantine B.

06:38.156 --> 06:40.659
This is where the infected
are brought for research.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.962
Now, we've separated
the infected into five types.

06:42.995 --> 06:44.930
I... I'm sorry. You said five?

06:44.964 --> 06:50.168
Level 1, flu-like symptoms.
Initially mistaken for Ebola.

06:50.202 --> 06:53.139
This is Level 2,
the hemorrhaging begins.

06:53.171 --> 06:55.614
Level 3, patient secrets
a black necrotic blood

06:55.615 --> 06:57.243
from prolonged
internal hemorrhaging,

06:57.276 --> 07:02.315
brain damage from blood loss, confusion
from high fever, extreme aggression.

07:02.348 --> 07:04.384
- And here's Level 4.
- Help us.

07:04.416 --> 07:05.517
Please.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.286
This is the interesting stage,

07:07.320 --> 07:09.988
the hibernation stage.
Kinda like suspended animation.

07:10.022 --> 07:14.493
Comatose, unresponsive. The heart
eventually stops, or so we thought.

07:14.526 --> 07:18.298
But it actually slows so that
it's virtually untraceable.

07:18.330 --> 07:20.465
Look at these two.
They come together in love,

07:20.498 --> 07:25.137
but the first one to wake up will
kill the other one and not know why.

07:25.171 --> 07:29.142
We were euthanizing Level 4's, but
we ran outta potassium chloride.

07:29.175 --> 07:32.412
And that's when we discovered
a second incubation. Follow me.

07:32.445 --> 07:35.714
Wait. We only diagnosed
four levels of infection.

07:35.748 --> 07:38.482
Yeah. Well,
no wonder New York fell.

07:38.483 --> 07:42.154
Okay, now...

07:42.187 --> 07:47.026
Do not step off
the yellow line. Repeat that.

07:47.058 --> 07:48.361
Do not step off the yellow line.

07:48.394 --> 07:50.130
Okay.

07:53.531 --> 07:57.402
Level 5,
severe brain damage.

07:57.435 --> 08:01.306
The Fila virus has mutated
into a rabid state.

08:02.474 --> 08:04.309
The patient becomes
extremely violent

08:04.342 --> 08:07.412
and will attack
and kill anything it encounters,

08:07.445 --> 08:08.513
even its own family.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.418
Help me!
Somebody, please, help me!

08:13.449 --> 08:14.587
I told you
to stay on the yellow line!

08:26.297 --> 08:29.469
Listen, you drop your guard for one
second and they will kill you.

08:29.502 --> 08:32.070
We can't have that, doctor,
you're too valuable.

08:36.107 --> 08:38.277
- Jesus.
- What are they doing?

08:40.111 --> 08:42.015
You're shooting them?

08:42.047 --> 08:45.050
Yeah, that's the way it is.
Look, we're not proud of it,

08:45.084 --> 08:47.320
but humanity left this city
a long time ago.

08:47.353 --> 08:49.188
I thought that was
all we had left.

08:49.220 --> 08:51.323
This is an uphill battle we're
fighting and we are losing.

08:51.357 --> 08:52.625
Now, I know you worked
a long time in the lab.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.226
Now, if you can't make it...

08:54.259 --> 08:57.362
New York wasn't a cake walk.
I survived there.

08:57.396 --> 09:01.401
I made it here.
I can handle it.

09:01.434 --> 09:03.136
Good.

09:39.472 --> 09:41.374
It's time to move.

10:03.429 --> 10:05.264
- Is your radio off?
- Yes, sir.

10:05.296 --> 10:06.632
This is between you and me.

10:06.665 --> 10:10.303
You're the only one with
CDC credentials on the team.

10:10.335 --> 10:13.371
Now, while the gunner has tactical
command, you're in charge.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.575
Now, if you become infected,
keep it to yourself.

10:15.608 --> 10:18.511
Don't tell anyone. And when you
return, you'll be taken care of.

10:18.544 --> 10:22.148
With antitoxins,
Level 1 is treatable.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.583
That applies to you
and you alone.

10:23.616 --> 10:25.885
If another member
of the team gets infected,

10:25.917 --> 10:28.220
you leave
by any means necessary.

10:28.253 --> 10:32.425
Now, we stayed strong for 33 days.
New York fell. We don't have to.

10:32.458 --> 10:36.262
- Now, state your mission.
- Extraction. Saint Mary's Prep.

10:36.295 --> 10:41.367
Eighty-nine Fila virus survivors.
Locate. Administer mosquito.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.337
- Red retrieve. Black...
- If the blood test is positive?

10:44.369 --> 10:45.637
We leave them behind.

10:45.671 --> 10:51.143
Without exception.
Hey, Lauren, good luck.

10:51.176 --> 10:53.245
Thank you, sir.

10:56.714 --> 10:59.384
Sir?

10:59.417 --> 11:03.221
...I was just wondering if we
have any new information

11:03.254 --> 11:06.424
about, Team 313.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.528
No. Sorry.

11:09.728 --> 11:11.664
- Sir?
- Yeah?

11:11.696 --> 11:14.200
Permission to search for 313?

11:14.233 --> 11:16.569
Turn your radio on.
Listen up, everyone.

11:16.602 --> 11:19.372
This is Dr. Greer.
Stay in the designated group.

11:19.405 --> 11:23.242
Do not deviate to look for
family and friends. Stay strong.

11:23.275 --> 11:25.745
Snatch the survivors.
Get home safe.

11:25.777 --> 11:27.312
Greer out.

11:28.446 --> 11:30.482
You the doc on my 314?

11:30.516 --> 11:34.252
...yes, I...
I'm Dr. Lauren Chase.

11:34.286 --> 11:38.190
You look fresh.
You got red on you, man.

11:38.224 --> 11:41.493
You already bringing bad luck and
we ain't even out the gate yet.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.429
Let's get this over with.

11:52.238 --> 11:55.641
- So, you're the navigator?
- I am. I'm Denise.

11:55.674 --> 12:00.279
Right. Dr. Chase. Mind
if I take a look at the route?

12:00.311 --> 12:04.683
Sure thing. I laid out three routes
based on unobstructed roads.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.389
Let's, let's try Number 2.

12:10.421 --> 12:12.224
Okay.

12:12.257 --> 12:14.826
Hey, Doc, why don't you focus
on doing your own job?

12:14.859 --> 12:18.496
- Let us do ours.
- Hey, ignore him.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.333
We're very happy
to have you on board.

12:20.366 --> 12:21.601
Thank you.

12:21.633 --> 12:23.202
Okay.

12:41.552 --> 12:44.224
Good morning, doctor.

12:48.560 --> 12:53.465
We need you stand watch in the rear
when we get through the tunnel.

12:53.498 --> 12:56.368
This is for me? I...
I'd rather stay back here

12:56.401 --> 12:57.836
and do my work
if that's possible.

12:57.869 --> 12:59.804
We need everyone. Here.

12:59.838 --> 13:02.642
Take it. Take it.

13:05.777 --> 13:07.747
You ever play Whac-A-Mole?

13:07.780 --> 13:10.616
Yeah.

13:10.648 --> 13:12.751
Okay, good.
Then you understand the concept.

13:12.785 --> 13:16.622
If a mole pokes his head in,
you whack 'em right back out.

13:16.655 --> 13:19.625
Just try to think of it
as a game. It'll help.

13:19.657 --> 13:22.360
If you feel like you're in
trouble, just yell out.

13:22.393 --> 13:27.532
All right.
Wheeler, let's do it.

14:22.554 --> 14:25.391
Bus 314 ready for transport.

14:25.424 --> 14:31.764
Open in five,
four, three, two...

14:31.796 --> 14:34.399
Remember. It's just a game.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.870
My God.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.466
...that clear.

15:14.772 --> 15:17.642
Gunner,
get your ass up here, man.

15:19.777 --> 15:21.613
Let me in. Let me in.

15:21.647 --> 15:23.882
- Fuckin' shoot him.
- I'll break the windshield.

15:23.916 --> 15:25.966
What the fuck
do you think he's doin'?

15:25.967 --> 15:27.453
All right, open the damn door.

15:30.689 --> 15:33.526
- Keep it steady.
- You fuckin' crazy?

15:45.938 --> 15:48.574
Fuck. Somebody get Gunner.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.645
Slow down. You're too fast.

15:52.677 --> 15:56.614
Naw, keep goin'. Don't stop.
Come on. Pull me back in.

15:59.951 --> 16:02.520
No!

16:02.554 --> 16:05.024
Denise, help me!

16:29.046 --> 16:30.782
Close the door.

16:30.815 --> 16:33.752
Hey, help me.

17:13.858 --> 17:19.866
Are we clear?
I said, are we clear?

17:26.604 --> 17:28.007
Gunner?

17:37.682 --> 17:39.617
We're clear.

17:39.651 --> 17:41.053
Thanks.

17:54.600 --> 17:58.571
That wasn't a game.

17:58.603 --> 18:03.776
No, it's not. So, next
time, do us all a favor.

18:03.808 --> 18:06.077
Fight back
like your life depends on it.

18:10.082 --> 18:11.816
Hey, weren't we supposed
to turn there?

18:11.850 --> 18:13.886
The designated route
takes us through Sherman Oaks.

18:13.919 --> 18:15.921
Jesus.
How fuckin' green are you?

18:15.953 --> 18:17.922
Tell me somethin', you're not
familiar with the suburbs?

18:17.956 --> 18:22.761
- I was in Manhattan.
- But you have seen Level 5's, right?

18:22.794 --> 18:25.730
I've seen one... today.

18:25.764 --> 18:29.668
Well, imagine hundreds of 'em
and they all got eyes for you.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.603
That's what you
get in the suburbs.

18:31.636 --> 18:33.071
I'm sure it's fine.

18:33.104 --> 18:35.007
They're not gonna send us
through there if it's dangerous.

18:35.039 --> 18:38.009
In downtown, all we have to deal
with are Level 2's and 3's.

18:38.043 --> 18:40.713
Roaming the streets in gangs,
armed.

18:40.746 --> 18:42.982
She's got a point.
I say we park this bitch, chill.

18:43.015 --> 18:44.950
Then head back
in like a few hours.

18:44.982 --> 18:46.818
Tell Greer we didn't find shit.

18:46.852 --> 18:52.024
No, we have our destination. We're
going downtown to Saint Mary's.

18:52.056 --> 18:54.660
That's where 313
made their last call.

18:54.692 --> 18:58.963
Where the fuck is 313? Alls we
bringin' back are corpses, man.

18:58.997 --> 19:02.901
Listen, Saint Mary's
is a supply drop.

19:02.933 --> 19:06.738
Do you wanna eat?
Does everyone want to eat?

19:06.771 --> 19:09.874
You heard Greer. We stick to
the designated route.

19:11.677 --> 19:13.178
I am the Commanding Officer,

19:13.210 --> 19:15.079
and I say we're going
through Sherman Oaks.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.416
If you wanna
follow Greer's plan, go ahead.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.218
Be my guest.
Go out and steal a car.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.987
But if you wanna stay alive,
then you stay with us.

19:22.019 --> 19:25.825
And we're not goin' through
any suburbs. That's final.

19:29.061 --> 19:32.698
Hey. We're just
changing the route.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.199
We're not changing the plan.
I promise.

19:34.231 --> 19:36.768
What's 313?

19:36.802 --> 19:38.111
Another team.

19:38.112 --> 19:42.041
They went to Saint Mary's on a
supply run, came across the survivors.

19:42.074 --> 19:47.179
But 313 never made it back.
His wife was their gunner.

19:47.211 --> 19:49.848
Greer played me
the tape from your doctor.

19:57.889 --> 20:01.035
Okay, you're gonna try to get on
this freeway here on the onramp.

20:01.036 --> 20:02.862
Just be careful.

20:11.036 --> 20:14.806
No. Pick up.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

20:16.141 --> 20:18.744
<i>It's about time you called.</i>

20:18.776 --> 20:21.279
Too bad I'm not here.
So leave a message.

20:24.815 --> 20:26.719
There's no use for it.

20:28.253 --> 20:31.257
We use our
suit transmitters for com.

20:33.257 --> 20:35.760
Get back in your seat.

21:03.955 --> 21:05.824
Where is everybody?

21:05.856 --> 21:07.091
There aren't many left alive,

21:07.124 --> 21:08.926
but most of them
stick around churches.

21:08.959 --> 21:11.796
But parking garages, they treat
those things like roach motels.

21:11.830 --> 21:14.800
They're not roaches.
They're starving and scared.

21:14.833 --> 21:16.736
Fuck this.

21:17.835 --> 21:19.904
Don't worry.
I'll put it back on.

21:19.938 --> 21:23.307
You said you were in Manhattan.
Is that where you're from?

21:23.341 --> 21:26.078
No, I'm from here.
I was moved to New York

21:26.111 --> 21:27.979
to be part of a team
working on the vaccine.

21:28.013 --> 21:29.915
Can you tell us how it's going,
finding a cure and all?

21:29.948 --> 21:32.985
We've made some promising
breakthroughs with antitoxins.

21:33.017 --> 21:38.222
We've extracted the contaminant
from the defective cells.

21:38.256 --> 21:39.992
We feel very confident...

21:40.025 --> 21:42.795
Ain't nobody even figured out
what caused this shit-fest, man.

21:42.827 --> 21:44.930
And we countin' on these same
fuckin' idiots to save us.

21:44.962 --> 21:46.130
I heard it was in the water.

21:46.163 --> 21:47.999
There were lice
and Ebola mutations,

21:48.033 --> 21:50.803
brain parasites, the rapture.
I've heard 'em all.

21:50.835 --> 21:53.238
What about you guys?
You from LA?

21:53.270 --> 21:57.108
- I lived in the valley with my son.
- Is he back at the compound?

21:57.142 --> 22:02.782
This is Josh. He passed before
the virus hit, of leukemia.

22:07.318 --> 22:10.888
I'm sorry.

22:10.921 --> 22:14.892
It doesn't what we did before.
It only matters what we do now.

22:14.926 --> 22:18.831
Bullshit. Look at you
tryin' to act all tough.

22:18.863 --> 22:22.133
- He was a traffic cop.
- Go head. Keep talkin'.

22:22.167 --> 22:23.914
That piece might make
you feel safe,

22:23.915 --> 22:26.038
but you need it. Anybody
can pull a trigger.

22:26.071 --> 22:28.006
- You're just Greer's bitch.
- Wheeler?

22:28.038 --> 22:30.308
Nah, nah, no. Let this
jerkoff say what he wants.

22:30.342 --> 22:32.143
- Put that down. I'll say a lot more.
- Yeah.

22:32.177 --> 22:35.046
Y'all didn't ask me shit,
but I'll tell you anyway.

22:35.080 --> 22:40.285
Forty-two, 92, seven off.
I call this work release.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.187
- You're a felon.
- That scare you?

22:43.220 --> 22:46.959
No. We all do
whatever it takes to survive.

22:46.991 --> 22:51.229
For some of us, this may be
one last opportunity.

22:51.263 --> 22:53.432
Yeah. For what?

22:57.969 --> 22:59.971
A second chance.

23:01.672 --> 23:05.076
Please stop! Please...

23:05.110 --> 23:09.915
Help me. Please stop.

23:16.353 --> 23:19.091
What the fuck is this?

23:19.123 --> 23:20.992
- She doesn't look sick.
- Please...

23:22.393 --> 23:24.997
All right, get what you need.

23:25.029 --> 23:27.331
- I'm not sick. Please!
- Man.

23:27.364 --> 23:30.001
What are you doin'?
Get your tools. Your tools.

23:30.035 --> 23:32.170
Shit.

23:32.202 --> 23:35.106
Get me out of here, please!

23:35.140 --> 23:36.941
Let's go, doctor!

23:41.011 --> 23:42.248
Open the door.

23:47.218 --> 23:49.121
Please get me out of here.

23:49.153 --> 23:51.289
I'm not...
Please get me out of here.

23:51.323 --> 23:54.392
All right, ma'am. Just take it easy.
We're gonna take care of you.

23:54.426 --> 23:57.029
- I'm not sick.
- Just relax. Just relax.

23:57.062 --> 24:00.032
Please. We have to get
out of here. I'm not sick.

24:00.065 --> 24:02.934
Doc, what the hell
are you doin'? Come on.

24:02.968 --> 24:04.436
Check and see if she's infected.
Let's go.

24:04.469 --> 24:07.506
We have to get out of here now.
We have to get out of here now!

24:07.538 --> 24:09.507
We will, ma'am.
You have to calm down now.

24:09.540 --> 24:12.410
I'm not sick. I'm not sick.
I'm not...

24:12.443 --> 24:16.213
Come on. What are you doin'?
Making sure this, this test...

24:16.247 --> 24:19.084
Doctor, what are you doin'?
Give it to me. Give it to me.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.989
- Here.
- I'm not sick, please.

24:25.023 --> 24:27.959
All right, listen, just,
just turn around. Turn around.

24:30.362 --> 24:32.197
Come on, Doctor.

24:34.032 --> 24:38.170
Talk to me, Doctor.
How she doin'?

24:38.202 --> 24:40.137
She's not infected.

24:40.171 --> 24:42.207
She's not infected.
We can take her with us.

24:42.239 --> 24:44.175
Let's get her on the bus.
Let's go!

24:46.177 --> 24:49.348
Gunner, she's, she's stuck.
She's what? What?

24:49.381 --> 24:52.184
- Please...
- She's stuck. Gunner, she's stuck.

24:52.217 --> 24:53.752
She's, she's taped
to the grate. I...

24:53.785 --> 24:55.219
- Please, don't let me die.
- Doctor...

24:57.221 --> 24:58.323
- Get back on the bus!
- Please!

24:58.355 --> 25:00.025
It's a trap. It's a trap.

25:05.529 --> 25:09.100
- Get on the bus!
- All right, let's go. Let's go.

25:14.338 --> 25:16.174
Open the door.

25:48.405 --> 25:50.575
Come on, come on,
you can make it. Grab my hand.

25:50.607 --> 25:52.476
Wheeler, slow down.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.278
Can't!

25:57.082 --> 25:59.151
You're gonna shoot Gunner!

25:59.183 --> 26:01.185
Shoot, damn it, shoot.

26:01.219 --> 26:03.322
Shit!

26:06.391 --> 26:09.260
Run, you mutherfucker, run!

26:12.564 --> 26:16.267
He's in! He's in! He's in!

26:16.301 --> 26:18.403
Never again, you hear me.

26:18.436 --> 26:21.573
You learn your ass
to run like the rest of us.

26:21.605 --> 26:23.141
Is it over?

26:23.173 --> 26:25.076
What are you doing?

26:25.110 --> 26:26.378
Listen to me.

26:26.411 --> 26:29.247
You better start fightin' back
or you gonna get us all killed,

26:29.279 --> 26:32.249
and I'm not lettin' that happen.
You understand me?

26:32.283 --> 26:35.734
Now, you go to Denise and then
you fix my goddamn shoulder.

26:35.735 --> 26:37.589
Now do your damn job!

26:44.328 --> 26:46.163
How could they do that?

26:46.197 --> 26:51.169
Everybody has their limit.

26:51.201 --> 26:53.704
Think of it like
being underwater.

26:53.738 --> 26:57.609
Holding your breath, you're fine,
but once you reach a certain point,

26:57.642 --> 27:00.546
you'll do anything
to get back on top.

27:15.626 --> 27:18.529
Did they
train you for the field?

27:18.563 --> 27:23.401
- Yes, extensive.
- Where'd you practice before this?

27:23.433 --> 27:24.702
What?

27:24.736 --> 27:29.908
You are a doctor.
So, where did you practice?

27:29.940 --> 27:32.643
Lab technician,
11 years with the CDC.

27:32.677 --> 27:36.148
I was chosen to lead this team
because I am qualified to do so.

27:39.350 --> 27:41.719
I got it. Thank you, doctor.

28:21.526 --> 28:25.330
We're less than two miles to the
school. Let's hope we're not too late.

28:27.699 --> 28:29.567
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

28:29.601 --> 28:33.305
Those people that attacked us,
what do they want?

28:33.337 --> 28:36.641
Get various supplies,
a way back in, food.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.642
Are you the suburbs are as bad?

28:38.676 --> 28:43.315
The suburbs still look nice.
Don't let that fool you.

28:43.347 --> 28:46.784
- Did you have family here?
- My husband and my daughter.

28:49.453 --> 28:51.289
Did they make it out?

28:53.790 --> 28:57.695
I haven't heard from them
since all of this started.

28:57.728 --> 29:01.032
If the outbreak had
happened a couple of days

29:01.033 --> 29:03.235
different on either
end, I would've...

29:05.503 --> 29:07.572
I should've been there.

29:07.604 --> 29:10.507
Two point five billion dead
and he still believes in God.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.543
There's one theory
you can cross off.

29:12.576 --> 29:15.814
The rapture would've
sucked his dumb ass right up.

29:15.846 --> 29:18.583
Shouldn't you ask him to stop
and check for uninfected?

29:18.615 --> 29:19.560
We're not stopping.

29:19.561 --> 29:21.452
They're trying to
preserve the population.

29:21.486 --> 29:24.177
Please. Greer could give
two shits about these people.

29:24.178 --> 29:25.523
We're pickin' up guinea pigs.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.726
You really think
it's conspiracy shit?

29:27.758 --> 29:30.594
Once the docs run outta people
to try their new vaccines on,

29:30.628 --> 29:34.399
they'll turn to us. Am I wrong?

29:34.431 --> 29:36.500
What am I asking you for?
You don't know shit.

29:36.534 --> 29:39.638
If we get back,
ask Greer about Quarantine A,

29:39.671 --> 29:42.274
about what he plans to do
with these survivors.

29:42.306 --> 29:43.674
He'll tell you I'm right.

29:43.709 --> 29:47.478
The only thing I'm stoppin' for
is Denny's. I am fuckin' starvin'.

29:47.511 --> 29:49.380
Isn't there food
at the compound?

29:49.413 --> 29:51.583
No, not for us.
We have to earn our keep.

29:51.615 --> 29:54.952
I've hardly eaten in days,
but it could be worse.

29:54.953 --> 29:56.621
Most of them die of starvation.

29:56.653 --> 30:00.624
Not all of us live in the
first-class camp, Dr. Chase.

30:00.658 --> 30:02.526
- Shit. Stop the bus!
- Dude, you see somethin'?

30:02.559 --> 30:03.761
Yeah. Stop the bus.

30:03.795 --> 30:05.397
I'm gonna take a lap
around the block.

30:05.430 --> 30:07.599
Make sure this ain't no trap.

30:07.632 --> 30:12.370
Either this bus stops moving
or you stop moving.

30:12.402 --> 30:15.339
Stop the bus.

31:47.532 --> 31:51.536
My God. Sorry.

32:49.559 --> 32:52.796
Help me! Please... help me.

32:52.830 --> 32:54.966
Get off me.

32:59.769 --> 33:02.539
- Grab her.
- My God.

33:31.869 --> 33:33.572
Thanks.

33:41.645 --> 33:44.715
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

33:44.748 --> 33:46.718
Where the hell were you?

33:46.750 --> 33:49.653
I'm the only one who knows how to drive
this bitch. I ain't riskin' shit.

33:49.687 --> 33:51.790
Did you find anything inside?

33:58.596 --> 34:03.134
Hey, the school's like
three blocks from here, so,

34:03.167 --> 34:05.670
I'm gonna keep us movin'. Cool?

34:05.703 --> 34:07.572
Yeah.

34:20.685 --> 34:23.522
I'm sorry about your wife.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.889
Have...

34:28.592 --> 34:33.098
Have you ever
heard of infecteds...

34:36.033 --> 34:38.036
...eating people?

34:39.703 --> 34:44.074
No. Why?

34:46.777 --> 34:49.047
Did you see something?

35:01.692 --> 35:02.960
We're here.

35:12.136 --> 35:13.872
Shall we?

35:15.006 --> 35:16.875
Let's do it.

35:19.176 --> 35:21.145
Open the door.

35:31.922 --> 35:34.960
Fuckin' sauna in here.
I can't see shit.

36:22.739 --> 36:24.908
Well,
it looks like nobody's home.

36:32.783 --> 36:34.685
Maybe they all left.

36:49.966 --> 36:53.171
Yes. Yes. Yeah,
somebody help me push this.

36:59.143 --> 37:05.315
Yeah, baby. Jackpot. My God.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.084
Wheeler, you can't
take your helmet off.

37:07.118 --> 37:09.053
What's it matter?
It's not like it's airborne.

37:09.085 --> 37:11.189
We have to keep going. We have
to keep looking for survivors.

37:11.221 --> 37:14.057
Fuck that, nurse.
Don't you wanna eat?

37:14.091 --> 37:15.727
I'll help you look.

37:15.759 --> 37:17.794
- Yeah.
- Don't go far.

37:17.828 --> 37:18.896
Yo!

37:21.765 --> 37:27.171
They got raspberry.
Shit. They got steak. What?

37:31.274 --> 37:33.310
Yo, can I ask you somethin'?

37:35.111 --> 37:36.980
What you think of the doc?

38:04.241 --> 38:06.244
Please...

38:07.844 --> 38:09.180
Shit.

38:13.283 --> 38:17.187
I'm gonna check out a few more of these
rooms. You go ahead. I'll catch up.

38:17.221 --> 38:18.923
Okay.

39:59.689 --> 40:02.192
Please, pick up.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.960
Megan?

40:03.993 --> 40:05.962
Megan, sweetheart, is that you?

40:05.995 --> 40:07.198
Mom?

40:07.230 --> 40:09.366
Hi. Hi, baby. How are you?

40:09.399 --> 40:11.401
Mom, is that you?

40:11.435 --> 40:14.471
Yes. Yes, it's me.
I'm here. Are, are you okay?

40:14.504 --> 40:16.207
Where are you?
Are, are you at the house?

40:16.239 --> 40:19.276
<i>- Yeah.
- Why haven't you been answering?</i>

40:20.511 --> 40:23.381
Dad said to only turn
it on once a day.

40:24.515 --> 40:28.453
Where is your father?
Is he there?

40:30.286 --> 40:33.957
He left to find help.

40:33.991 --> 40:35.993
I'm scared. Please.

40:36.026 --> 40:38.930
I know, baby. I know you are,
but you're doing great. Okay?

40:38.962 --> 40:41.498
I want you to listen to me.
I'm coming to get you.

40:41.531 --> 40:45.268
I'm gonna be there very soon, and
I love you more than anything.

40:45.301 --> 40:48.305
So, you stay put and I'm gonna
be there soon, okay.

40:48.339 --> 40:51.009
Megan?

40:53.009 --> 40:54.411
Megan?

40:57.047 --> 40:59.183
- Shit.
- You all right?

41:00.317 --> 41:02.286
Yeah.

41:02.319 --> 41:04.322
You call for us?

41:04.355 --> 41:06.491
I found something.

41:08.591 --> 41:10.494
Let's go.

41:17.201 --> 41:19.737
- What?
- Here.

41:19.770 --> 41:21.205
All right.

41:25.174 --> 41:27.444
It's barricaded
from the inside.

42:13.156 --> 42:14.524
Hello?

42:17.560 --> 42:20.597
It's okay.
I won't hurt you.

42:24.567 --> 42:27.004
Where are the others?

42:40.084 --> 42:43.388
Is, is that your child?

42:50.326 --> 42:53.430
Please. Take it.

42:54.297 --> 42:56.167
Please take it.

42:56.200 --> 43:00.136
- Stand back, ma'am. Step back.
- Put your gun down.

43:00.169 --> 43:04.174
Put it down.
It's okay. It's okay.

43:04.207 --> 43:06.376
We're not gonna hurt you.
It's okay. It's okay.

43:06.410 --> 43:09.613
Are there other people
here with you?

43:09.645 --> 43:12.283
Just take him, please.
He's not infected.

43:12.315 --> 43:17.154
That's great. I'm gonna have to give him
a blood test to, to make sure, okay.

43:17.187 --> 43:19.390
But he's not infected. Take him.

43:19.422 --> 43:23.093
I, I know. Just, just, just put
him down right in front of you.

43:32.569 --> 43:34.471
His name's Jeffrey.

43:39.509 --> 43:42.412
He, he cries a lot,
but it'll pass.

43:42.446 --> 43:47.618
I'm sorry.
I, I can't take him.

43:47.651 --> 43:52.123
But, but you have to.
He can't stay here.

43:52.156 --> 43:56.460
You have children?
He's all I have left.

43:56.493 --> 43:59.363
I'm so sorry. I can't take him.

43:59.395 --> 44:00.418
But you said you'd take him.

44:00.419 --> 44:02.466
It's okay. We can, we
can come back for him.

44:02.498 --> 44:03.667
Are, are there
other people here with you?

44:03.700 --> 44:05.602
But you're here now.
Take him now.

44:05.636 --> 44:07.671
Lower your fuckin' voice.

44:09.640 --> 44:12.475
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

44:12.509 --> 44:14.678
- Take him.
- We have to go now.

44:14.710 --> 44:19.250
Please. Take him!
Take him. Take him!

44:33.529 --> 44:38.136
How many you kill today?
This ain't no different.

44:42.538 --> 44:46.544
Let's go. Come on.
We're leaving. Let's go.

44:47.777 --> 44:49.580
Now.

44:59.355 --> 45:02.660
Denise?
What the fuck are you doing?

45:02.692 --> 45:04.761
We have to finish this.

45:05.696 --> 45:08.232
Help me, Gunner.

45:08.265 --> 45:10.301
- Please. Please.
- All right, all right, all right.

45:10.334 --> 45:12.203
Move aside. Move.

45:34.390 --> 45:36.359
Holy shit.

45:41.431 --> 45:43.367
We're too late.

45:55.544 --> 45:59.450
What a fuckin' waste.
You wanna check 'em, doc?

46:00.750 --> 46:06.790
No. You heard Denise.
Mission's over. We should go.

46:17.500 --> 46:19.303
Fuck is that?

46:22.471 --> 46:24.341
Run. Run.

46:29.578 --> 46:32.382
Get those doors closed!

46:33.750 --> 46:36.687
Denise, get somethin' to keep
these doors closed.

46:43.593 --> 46:47.698
- Come on, goddamn it. Feel it.
- Gunner...

46:47.730 --> 46:51.502
All right, come on.
Let's move, move, move.

46:51.535 --> 46:55.506
We need to get to
the bus now. Fuck this.

47:45.489 --> 47:47.624
We can't jump from here.
We'll break our legs.

47:47.656 --> 47:49.626
I don't care. Open the window.

47:52.495 --> 47:53.596
You can't open it?

47:53.631 --> 47:56.600
- Wheeler they're nailed shut.
- Move damn it. Move.

48:01.004 --> 48:04.808
Take this. You got it?

48:06.877 --> 48:08.579
Okay.

48:18.422 --> 48:19.690
Gunner!

48:19.723 --> 48:22.558
Go. I'll be
right behind you. Go.

49:01.897 --> 49:03.933
My God.

49:05.634 --> 49:07.203
- Give me the gun.
- What? No.

49:07.236 --> 49:09.639
- Give it to me!
- Why? So you can leave us?

49:09.672 --> 49:16.513
- Fine. Fucking die with it.
- Wheeler? Shit.

49:16.546 --> 49:17.781
You okay?

49:21.785 --> 49:23.654
Let's go.

49:28.825 --> 49:30.727
Where do we go?

49:30.759 --> 49:34.064
I don't know. Come on.
You'll catch your breath later.

49:40.904 --> 49:43.540
- You have a cellphone?
- No. Call the control center.

49:43.573 --> 49:44.942
How do I do that?

49:47.277 --> 49:50.948
Hello?
Control, this is Dr. Chase, 314.

49:50.980 --> 49:54.551
Is anybody there? Hello?

49:54.584 --> 49:56.819
This is Team 314.
Is anybody there?

49:56.852 --> 49:59.822
We must be outta range. How we
gonna get back to the compound?

49:59.855 --> 50:01.825
It's too far to walk back.

50:01.857 --> 50:04.060
We need to find a place to hide until
Dr. Greer sends out the next team.

50:04.093 --> 50:06.696
How long will that take?
I can't wait.

50:06.730 --> 50:08.966
We don't have a choice.
It's almost dark.

50:08.998 --> 50:10.801
They'll be ten times
as many of them.

50:10.834 --> 50:12.736
Pull it together. Let's go.

50:26.049 --> 50:27.985
Why can't we just
take one of these?

50:28.018 --> 50:30.855
Because the X's mean
the gas is sucked out.

50:32.154 --> 50:34.857
- How many bullets do you have left?
- Two.

50:34.890 --> 50:40.730
You might wanna save them.
For us.

50:47.571 --> 50:50.641
Shit. I think someone's coming.

50:54.743 --> 50:57.847
- The van over there.
- Okay.

51:36.953 --> 51:40.190
Fucking starving.

51:40.223 --> 51:42.359
We're moving to the next block.

51:42.392 --> 51:44.127
Almost gone.

52:20.930 --> 52:22.933
His feet...

52:50.794 --> 52:55.866
I think they're gone.
Are you all right?

52:55.899 --> 52:58.868
Yeah. Let's go.

53:36.071 --> 53:37.740
What was his name again?

53:37.774 --> 53:41.210
Josh.
He would've been eight.

53:42.879 --> 53:46.950
I told you maybe he was
lucky not to see all this.

53:46.982 --> 53:49.919
That's the lie I tell myself.
I want his clothes.

53:49.953 --> 53:56.226
I want his smell. I want his room. I
want him, not this fucking picture.

53:59.094 --> 54:05.334
Denise, I spoke with my
daughter. She's alive.

54:05.368 --> 54:09.038
My God, Lauren.
I don't know what to say.

54:09.071 --> 54:11.874
How long do you think it will take
for them to send another team?

54:11.908 --> 54:13.810
Maybe a day or a week,
but they will.

54:13.843 --> 54:15.879
- We just have to wait here together.
- What do you mean?

54:15.911 --> 54:18.247
They're not gone let me back into the
compound without you or the bus.

54:18.281 --> 54:20.016
- Yes, they will.
- No, Wheeler was right.

54:20.049 --> 54:22.319
They don't care about us.
I need you.

54:22.352 --> 54:26.089
But I can't wait. Dr. Greer said they
were gonna stop sending teams out,

54:26.122 --> 54:27.924
that they were gonna lock
the doors and wait it out.

54:27.957 --> 54:30.826
No, you're a doctor.
They will come for you.

54:30.859 --> 54:34.163
No. Not if they...

54:36.198 --> 54:38.101
What?

54:40.102 --> 54:42.205
Dr. Chase?

54:44.174 --> 54:50.013
If you could get Josh back,
wouldn't you do whatever

54:50.046 --> 54:52.948
it takes no matter
the consequences?

54:52.982 --> 54:55.384
I can save my daughter.

54:55.417 --> 54:59.855
I thought she was dead,
but she's alive.

54:59.888 --> 55:04.294
And they won't, they won't be
coming for me, not if they know...

55:04.326 --> 55:07.131
If they know what? What?

55:12.301 --> 55:18.975
- Lauren?
- I'm not... I'm not Lauren Chase.

55:21.176 --> 55:22.822
What do you mean?

55:22.823 --> 55:26.115
I came to the compound
on an extraction.

55:26.149 --> 55:27.917
I'm not a doctor.

55:27.951 --> 55:30.887
No, I saw you.
You were with Greer. I saw...

55:30.919 --> 55:36.325
I stole this from a doctor I
found in the street in New York.

55:36.359 --> 55:38.328
Dr. Chase.

55:40.395 --> 55:43.332
- My name's Rebecca Thomas.
- Why are you telling me this?

55:43.366 --> 55:45.936
Because I thought
you should know.

55:45.968 --> 55:49.011
I was on a business
trip when the outbreak

55:49.012 --> 55:51.040
hit and I should've
come right back,

55:51.073 --> 55:52.942
but they told me everything
was gonna be okay.

55:52.975 --> 55:55.211
And I believed them. And then
they told me I couldn't leave.

55:55.245 --> 55:56.880
They told me my family was gone.

55:56.913 --> 55:58.315
You put all of
our lives in danger.

55:58.348 --> 56:02.052
Gunner is dead because of you.
How could you do this?

56:02.085 --> 56:03.453
How could you be so selfish?

56:03.486 --> 56:05.422
I did everything I could
to get back into the city.

56:05.455 --> 56:08.959
The only way was to pretend
I was somebody else.

56:08.991 --> 56:12.328
I lost my family once,
because I didn't do anything,

56:12.361 --> 56:17.066
because I trusted that someone
else would bring them back to me.

56:17.100 --> 56:20.103
Now, I'm sorry
that I lied to you,

56:20.136 --> 56:22.973
but I need to go my
family and I need to go now.

56:23.006 --> 56:25.975
You can't go. We don't have Gunner.
We don't have a bus.

56:26.009 --> 56:28.978
If Josh were alive...

56:29.011 --> 56:33.216
...and you knew that he didn't
have a week, you would go to him

56:33.248 --> 56:36.118
You, you, you would,
you would try no matter what.

56:36.152 --> 56:40.490
Before when you wanted to change
the route to Sherman Oaks,

56:40.522 --> 56:43.993
- that's where your family is, right?
- It's close.

56:44.027 --> 56:46.329
All right.
I'm gonna go with you.

56:46.361 --> 56:49.665
- You don't have to.
- No, you're right.

56:49.698 --> 56:52.001
If Josh was still alive,
I would've done the same thing.

56:52.035 --> 56:55.372
Besides if they haven't realized
you're lying, you're my only way back.

56:59.075 --> 57:03.379
Okay. Let's see if this place
has water and weapons.

58:37.406 --> 58:40.776
I, I can't see it.
Can't. Denise?

59:47.710 --> 59:50.147
Where did it go? Did you see it?

01:00:09.464 --> 01:00:11.867
Help me. Help me.

01:00:11.901 --> 01:00:13.870
- I can't see it.
- Hit it! Hit it!

01:00:13.902 --> 01:00:16.506
I can't. Denise?

01:00:23.379 --> 01:00:25.114
You came back.

01:00:26.515 --> 01:00:28.384
I ain't dyin' a virgin.

01:00:31.286 --> 01:00:33.355
What took you so long?

01:00:33.388 --> 01:00:36.225
Come here.

01:00:36.259 --> 01:00:38.161
Thank God.

01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:44.534
First time I seen
a Level 5 downtown.

01:00:44.567 --> 01:00:46.335
If you ain't gone trust
no one else to touch that,

01:00:46.368 --> 01:00:47.669
how bout you keep it
with next time?

01:00:47.703 --> 01:00:48.738
Where the hell did you go?

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.640
I hid in a bank.
Retirement plan.

01:00:51.674 --> 01:00:53.476
I saw y'all run up in here.
But did you talk to the doc?

01:00:53.509 --> 01:00:55.378
No response from the compound.

01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:57.212
I'm talking about the doc here.

01:00:57.245 --> 01:00:59.748
- Another team?
- No, he's locked up in some hospital.

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:01.484
I told him I'd find you
and call him.

01:01:01.517 --> 01:01:04.353
He didn't even believe
I was with the team. Turn it on.

01:01:05.654 --> 01:01:08.323
This is Dr. Chase.

01:01:08.357 --> 01:01:11.628
Is there a doctor out there
who spoke with my driver?

01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:19.468
Hello? Dr. Chase?

01:01:19.502 --> 01:01:23.239
Yes, Dr. Lauren Chase,
extraction team 314.

01:01:23.272 --> 01:01:24.507
Thank God.

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.708
Told you I wasn't lyin',
mutherfucker.

01:01:25.741 --> 01:01:27.210
My name is Dr. Ward.

01:01:27.243 --> 01:01:28.710
<i>I have eight survivors with me.</i>

01:01:28.743 --> 01:01:30.279
Can you rescue us?

01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:33.348
Ward... are you
the doctor from 313?

01:01:33.381 --> 01:01:37.219
<i>- That's right.
- It was his voice on the call that Greer played me.</i>

01:01:37.252 --> 01:01:39.254
We were on an extraction
to Saint Mary's.

01:01:39.288 --> 01:01:40.623
We lost our vehicle
in the process.

01:01:40.656 --> 01:01:42.392
We have one.

01:01:42.424 --> 01:01:44.259
<i>Does your driver know how
to hotwire an ambulance?</i>

01:01:44.292 --> 01:01:45.495
Fuck yeah.

01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:47.330
Good. We're in the
Presbyterian Hospital.

01:01:47.363 --> 01:01:49.533
<i>We'll be waiting for you
in the back entrance.</i>

01:01:53.569 --> 01:01:55.438
That's like three
or four blocks from here.

01:01:57.473 --> 01:01:59.676
You really know how to
hotwire an ambulance?

01:01:59.709 --> 01:02:02.745
Not so bad
having a felon now?

01:02:04.779 --> 01:02:08.718
Yeah. Three blocks. We can run.

01:02:11.486 --> 01:02:13.255
What?

01:02:15.323 --> 01:02:16.825
Shit.

01:02:16.859 --> 01:02:19.261
- I was gonna say.
- What happened?

01:02:19.294 --> 01:02:22.331
In the bank, I saw dude like that.
I killed him, but...

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:23.433
Open it.

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:30.239
- My God.
- It's not bad. I can move, but...

01:02:30.272 --> 01:02:31.607
It can't be that bad yet.
Stitch me up.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.742
She can't.

01:02:35.678 --> 01:02:37.446
We lost our first-aid supplies.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.582
Shit. Then we gotta
get back to the compound.

01:02:39.614 --> 01:02:41.417
Wheeler, they won't
let you back in.

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:44.453
- Those are Greer's orders.
- We are not leaving him.

01:02:46.555 --> 01:02:50.393
- You came back for us. Yes?
- I'm here.

01:02:50.426 --> 01:02:52.828
You chose to go to
the compound and work.

01:02:52.861 --> 01:02:54.463
You could've joined
one of those gangs,

01:02:54.497 --> 01:02:56.332
but you didn't,
because you wanted to help.

01:02:56.364 --> 01:02:59.602
Say it. You wanted to help.
You want a second chance, right?

01:02:59.634 --> 01:03:01.803
Yeah. I do.

01:03:01.837 --> 01:03:03.607
Good.

01:03:05.674 --> 01:03:09.745
We aren't going back
to the compound, not just yet.

01:03:09.779 --> 01:03:12.649
We're gonna go the hospital.
You're gonna get us a car.

01:03:12.681 --> 01:03:16.386
You're gonna drive to my house
and we're gonna save my family.

01:03:16.419 --> 01:03:17.453
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

01:03:17.486 --> 01:03:18.621
My husband and my daughter,

01:03:18.654 --> 01:03:19.856
we're gonna go get them.

01:03:19.888 --> 01:03:22.524
- You know about this?
- I'm going with her.

01:03:22.558 --> 01:03:24.279
We get my family and I
will get you back into the

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.828
compound and have you
treated for the virus,

01:03:25.861 --> 01:03:31.401
but only if you do exactly
what I tell you to. Yes or no?

01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:34.504
You ain't give me a fuckin' choice.
If I do, you're gonna fix this.

01:03:34.536 --> 01:03:35.705
Yes.

01:03:35.738 --> 01:03:37.506
Can you?

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.475
Level 1 infections
can be treated.

01:03:39.507 --> 01:03:43.879
Then, yeah. Fuck yeah. You save
me, I'll save your family.

01:03:43.913 --> 01:03:45.681
Wait. What are you doing?

01:03:45.714 --> 01:03:50.519
You wanna make it to the
hospital, I go ahead of you,

01:03:50.553 --> 01:03:56.592
let you know if it's clear. I'm
already infected, so fuck it, right?

01:03:56.625 --> 01:03:58.695
Are you sure about this.

01:03:58.727 --> 01:04:01.430
What have I got to lose?

01:04:28.556 --> 01:04:30.326
Shit.

01:04:33.895 --> 01:04:35.464
Shit.

01:04:38.167 --> 01:04:39.701
They're gonna kill him.

01:04:39.734 --> 01:04:41.503
Get ready to run.

01:04:44.672 --> 01:04:46.408
Wheeler?

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:56.418
What's happening?

01:05:10.765 --> 01:05:14.469
- Are you okay?
- I think I just shit my pants.

01:05:14.502 --> 01:05:15.837
What happened?

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:18.874
They wanted what I had,
which ain't nothin'.

01:05:18.908 --> 01:05:23.613
So, I said I seen a bus a couple
miles back. I think they bought it.

01:05:23.645 --> 01:05:26.615
- Okay.
- Are we close?

01:05:26.649 --> 01:05:29.486
- It's just around this corner.
- All right, let's go.

01:05:46.569 --> 01:05:47.870
Where is Josh?

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:49.038
What?

01:05:49.071 --> 01:05:51.440
I can't find Josh.

01:05:51.473 --> 01:05:55.510
Bullshit. Bullshit.
Over there.

01:05:55.544 --> 01:05:56.779
- Come on, Denise.
- Josh...

01:05:56.812 --> 01:05:59.681
- Denise, come on!
- Josh.

01:05:59.714 --> 01:06:01.917
Come on, Denise.

01:06:05.553 --> 01:06:07.689
Come on, Denise.

01:06:16.966 --> 01:06:19.801
Doc, she's gone.
Come on. She's gone.

01:06:19.835 --> 01:06:22.238
Denise!

01:07:27.169 --> 01:07:30.105
Denise! Denise!

01:07:32.107 --> 01:07:37.580
No. Please. Please. Please.
I'm hurt. Don't hurt me.

01:07:37.613 --> 01:07:40.015
You're, you're a doctor, right?
Right?

01:07:40.049 --> 01:07:42.785
Please. Please. Please, no. No.

01:07:59.768 --> 01:08:03.940
It's me. It's just me.
You're all right.

01:08:10.045 --> 01:08:13.748
I'm sorry.

01:08:13.782 --> 01:08:17.086
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.756
We gotta go, all right?
Come on.

01:08:44.845 --> 01:08:46.014
I can't hear you!

01:08:48.651 --> 01:08:52.020
- Are you Dr. Chase?
- Yes, I am.

01:08:52.054 --> 01:08:55.992
- Who's he?
- This is my driver. Now let us in.

01:08:56.024 --> 01:08:58.059
No, he's not.
He's one of them.

01:08:58.093 --> 01:08:59.694
Fuck you, man.
I'm the fuckin' driver.

01:08:59.728 --> 01:09:02.796
He's my driver.
You have my word.

01:09:02.831 --> 01:09:04.734
Why isn't he wearing his suit?

01:09:06.001 --> 01:09:07.203
Look, we don't have time
for this right now.

01:09:07.236 --> 01:09:09.171
Prove to me he isn't infected,
both of you.

01:09:09.203 --> 01:09:10.773
Otherwise, no one's coming in.

01:09:10.805 --> 01:09:11.939
Let us in.

01:09:11.974 --> 01:09:14.877
Okay. Wheeler,
can you open my pack.

01:09:23.285 --> 01:09:26.055
See. I'm not infected.

01:09:26.087 --> 01:09:27.889
Now him.

01:09:29.992 --> 01:09:31.627
Okay.

01:09:44.206 --> 01:09:47.243
He's not infected.
Now let us in.

01:09:47.276 --> 01:09:50.078
Meet us down in the garage.

01:09:54.049 --> 01:09:56.719
- You can take one of those.
- This one got gas?

01:09:56.751 --> 01:09:58.927
Yeah. And most
civilians don't even know

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:01.156
where the tank is on
one of those things.

01:10:02.825 --> 01:10:04.126
Are you all from Saint Mary's?

01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:07.696
Yeah. Right after
I contacted the compound,

01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:09.031
our bus was ambushed.

01:10:09.064 --> 01:10:12.000
My whole team perished along
with the rest of the survivors.

01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:16.237
We're all that's left. All right,
clear out the entire cabin.

01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:19.875
We need to fit everyone inside.
Where's the rest of your team?

01:10:19.907 --> 01:10:22.777
Where the fuck do you think?

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:23.879
My apologies.

01:10:23.912 --> 01:10:26.182
Did you hear that?

01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:30.185
All right. Come on. Let's go.
Everybody inside.

01:10:30.219 --> 01:10:31.988
Let's go. Let's go.

01:10:34.089 --> 01:10:35.725
After you.

01:10:40.929 --> 01:10:42.998
What the fuck?

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:44.233
Wheeler?

01:10:46.167 --> 01:10:48.804
- You lied to me!
- Look, Doc.

01:10:48.836 --> 01:10:50.305
- Who are you?
- Dr. Ward, what...

01:10:50.339 --> 01:10:51.974
Answer me. Who are you?

01:10:52.006 --> 01:10:54.210
I already told you.
I'm Dr. Lauren Chase from 314.

01:10:54.242 --> 01:10:56.812
I worked with Dr. Chase.
What have you done with her?

01:10:56.845 --> 01:10:57.420
I...

01:10:57.421 --> 01:10:59.148
We were sent to bring
you all back, doc.

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:01.216
- Answer the question!
- Lower your gun.

01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:05.220
We are all going back
to the compound together.

01:11:05.254 --> 01:11:08.123
Get back. Back!

01:11:14.362 --> 01:11:16.097
At least leave us the gun.

01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:18.800
If I see you in that compound,
I will fuckin' kill you!

01:11:18.834 --> 01:11:21.103
You're infected. You never will.

01:11:27.977 --> 01:11:32.014
Mutherfucker! And I'ma kill you,
you mutherfucker!

01:11:44.827 --> 01:11:46.862
Go, go.

01:11:46.894 --> 01:11:49.831
Just one more second.

01:11:52.835 --> 01:11:55.104
Yes! Come on!

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.376
No!

01:12:19.461 --> 01:12:22.164
You all right?
All your fingers and toes?

01:12:22.197 --> 01:12:26.868
- Yeah, I think so.
- Good. Now, where we goin'?

01:12:45.019 --> 01:12:48.122
So, what's your real name?

01:12:48.156 --> 01:12:50.192
Wheeler, I, I can explain.

01:12:50.224 --> 01:12:53.228
It's cool. Takes a con
to know a con.

01:12:53.261 --> 01:12:56.331
I was onto you way before
the doc blew your cover.

01:12:56.364 --> 01:12:59.068
You didn't know
how to use the mosquito.

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.103
You didn't know how to
wrap Gunner's shoulder.

01:13:01.135 --> 01:13:03.938
But you did fake
that blood test pretty quick.

01:13:03.971 --> 01:13:07.343
I met some grifters in my day,
but you're good.

01:13:07.376 --> 01:13:08.944
You gonna leave me out here?

01:13:08.977 --> 01:13:13.081
No. Your secret's safe.
Just tell me one thing.

01:13:13.114 --> 01:13:15.651
Where'd you learn how to
speak like a doctor?

01:13:15.684 --> 01:13:17.353
Thesaurus.

01:13:20.288 --> 01:13:23.959
Wheeler, I will get you
into the compound.

01:13:23.992 --> 01:13:25.394
I know.

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:32.100
So you just a mama tryin' to get
to her cubs?

01:13:32.134 --> 01:13:35.203
I'm Frederick. Freddie.

01:13:36.004 --> 01:13:37.105
Rebecca.

01:13:37.139 --> 01:13:40.910
Let's just stick with doc.

01:13:44.145 --> 01:13:47.183
Up there,
the one with the garden.

01:13:49.017 --> 01:13:51.953
All right.
I'll keep the engine runnin'.

01:13:51.987 --> 01:13:55.190
If you don't find what you're
lookin' for, say your goodbyes.

01:13:55.223 --> 01:13:57.894
It's more than most got.

01:13:58.359 --> 01:14:00.161
Thank you.

01:14:46.174 --> 01:14:51.113
Megan? Megan?

01:14:54.215 --> 01:14:56.318
Baby, are you here?

01:15:01.555 --> 01:15:07.964
Please, please. Please. Please.
Megan? Megan, it's Mom.

01:15:10.364 --> 01:15:15.103
Megan? My God.
My God.

01:15:16.138 --> 01:15:19.108
Megan? Megan?

01:15:21.209 --> 01:15:23.077
- Stay...
- No, baby.

01:15:23.111 --> 01:15:25.613
Baby, it's me. It's me.

01:15:25.647 --> 01:15:28.417
Mom?

01:15:28.450 --> 01:15:34.023
Come here. Come here.
Come here, sweet...

01:15:34.055 --> 01:15:36.591
Mommy, you came.

01:15:36.625 --> 01:15:39.228
- You're okay.
- You came.

01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:44.098
Of course, I came for you. I told you
I was gonna come for you, didn't I?

01:15:44.131 --> 01:15:46.201
Of course, I came.

01:15:47.469 --> 01:15:50.038
I love you so much.

01:15:53.407 --> 01:15:55.309
Megan, where's Dad?

01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:58.147
He's still not back.

01:15:59.413 --> 01:16:02.216
It's just me.

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:04.118
It's us now, okay.

01:16:04.152 --> 01:16:07.156
- Are we leaving?
- Yes. We have a ride out front.

01:16:07.188 --> 01:16:12.060
I have something for you.
Eat this slowly.

01:16:16.163 --> 01:16:19.300
I'm gonna be right back, okay.
Stay here.

01:16:39.453 --> 01:16:43.125
Baby? Megan?

01:16:43.157 --> 01:16:45.193
Tilt your head
back a little bit.

01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:51.333
It's just a little bit of water.

01:16:54.402 --> 01:16:56.138
What's that?

01:16:56.170 --> 01:16:57.472
It's nothing to
be nervous about.

01:16:57.505 --> 01:17:01.209
I just need to check
your blood. Hold my hand.

01:17:13.287 --> 01:17:14.622
Am I sick?

01:17:17.492 --> 01:17:22.663
No. No, you're not infected.
You're gonna be fine.

01:17:22.697 --> 01:17:25.300
- I am?
- Yes. Everything is gonna be fine.

01:17:25.332 --> 01:17:27.568
No...
I thought for sure that...

01:17:27.602 --> 01:17:31.607
Baby, you haven't eaten in so
long. Of course, you feel sick.

01:17:31.639 --> 01:17:35.576
I'm gonna go to the garage,
I need to grab a few things.

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:39.214
And when I come back, we're
gonna go the safe zone, okay?

01:18:52.453 --> 01:18:55.389
No.

01:18:55.422 --> 01:18:57.492
God, David.

01:19:12.741 --> 01:19:15.778
<i>My name is David Thomas.</i>

01:19:17.612 --> 01:19:20.782
<i>I've locked myself in here
to protect my daughter.</i>

01:19:20.814 --> 01:19:23.818
Whoever you are,
please save her.

01:19:23.852 --> 01:19:27.389
<i>My wife is Rebecca Thomas.</i>

01:19:27.421 --> 01:19:29.224
If you find her...

01:19:34.595 --> 01:19:36.764
...tell her I love her.

01:19:41.368 --> 01:19:46.607
<i>And that I'm sorry. Goodbye.</i>

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.379
David. I'm so sorry.

01:19:50.412 --> 01:19:52.381
Megan's alive.

01:19:52.413 --> 01:19:55.283
And if she's only Level 1,
I can...

01:19:57.786 --> 01:20:02.524
I will save our daughter.

01:20:18.806 --> 01:20:21.876
Fuck me.

01:20:26.547 --> 01:20:28.817
Megan, I've gotta check
something by the window, okay?

01:20:32.386 --> 01:20:33.688
Level 5's.

01:20:35.422 --> 01:20:36.858
What's that sound?

01:20:41.763 --> 01:20:44.366
- What are you doing?
- You need to put this on.

01:20:44.398 --> 01:20:46.834
- What about you?
- Megan, trust me.

01:20:53.575 --> 01:20:55.810
- Here, let me help you.
- Okay.

01:20:55.844 --> 01:20:57.846
Get down.
Put your feet in first.

01:21:00.782 --> 01:21:04.419
- We're gonna have to run, okay.
- Mom, I love you.

01:21:04.452 --> 01:21:09.692
Megan, I love you more than anything.
We're gonna be fine. Let's go.

01:21:13.728 --> 01:21:17.431
We're almost there.
We're almost there.

01:21:18.465 --> 01:21:19.533
Mom?

01:21:19.567 --> 01:21:20.801
- Go!
- Run, Megan! Run!

01:21:20.835 --> 01:21:21.837
Mom?

01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:24.840
Mom? Mom?

01:21:24.872 --> 01:21:28.576
Go. Go, Megan. Up the stairs.
Go upstairs. Hide.

01:21:28.609 --> 01:21:30.411
Mom...

01:21:30.444 --> 01:21:33.915
- Go, Wheeler, go.
- Go, go.

01:21:33.947 --> 01:21:35.416
Mom!

01:21:37.852 --> 01:21:40.421
Megan, run! Run!

01:21:43.491 --> 01:21:45.894
Wheeler! Go, Megan.

01:21:51.733 --> 01:21:54.603
- Fuck. There's too many.
- Okay. Okay. Open the door.

01:21:54.635 --> 01:21:56.537
- What?
- Just do it. Trust me.

01:21:59.541 --> 01:22:02.678
Go to the window.
Megan, open the window!

01:22:03.978 --> 01:22:05.647
Go!

01:22:05.679 --> 01:22:06.847
You have to come with us!

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.716
I know. Fuckin' jump!

01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:10.919
Come on, Megan. Come on.

01:22:38.813 --> 01:22:41.882
He's hurt.

01:22:41.916 --> 01:22:44.019
Help me. We gotta get him
to the front yard.

01:22:44.051 --> 01:22:46.654
Come on... Get up.

01:22:46.688 --> 01:22:49.858
- I can't.
- Get up.

01:22:49.890 --> 01:22:53.027
No...
I'm good.

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:57.665
No more hero shit.
Just get your girl.

01:22:57.698 --> 01:22:59.634
I'm so sorry, Freddie.

01:23:00.801 --> 01:23:02.903
- Run! Run!
- Go. Come on.

01:23:02.937 --> 01:23:05.707
No. Run. Run, Megan.

01:23:07.007 --> 01:23:08.911
It's okay. It's okay. Go.

01:23:10.678 --> 01:23:11.947
It's okay.

01:23:18.952 --> 01:23:22.590
Get in, Megan. Get in. Get in.
Lock the door. Lock the door.

01:23:43.978 --> 01:23:48.817
Baby, it's okay. They're gone.
It's behind us. They're gone.

01:24:24.885 --> 01:24:30.624
Megan? Megan, look at me.
Keep your eyes open, baby.

01:24:30.657 --> 01:24:32.861
Baby, open your eyes.
We're almost there.

01:24:32.894 --> 01:24:36.164
Megan? Megan, stay with me.

01:24:36.197 --> 01:24:38.667
Megan? Megan, please.

01:24:56.384 --> 01:25:00.022
Lord. It's okay.

01:25:05.859 --> 01:25:07.094
There it is.

01:25:37.759 --> 01:25:41.796
Megan, come on, baby. We have
to get out. Okay? Hold on to me.

01:25:46.667 --> 01:25:48.135
Talk to me.

01:25:51.805 --> 01:25:56.143
Megan? Megan?
Get up. Get up. Get up.

01:25:58.011 --> 01:25:59.715
Megan...

01:26:04.818 --> 01:26:09.189
Don't shoot.
Please. Please. Don't shoot.

01:26:09.223 --> 01:26:11.192
I'm Dr. Lauren Chase. Please.

01:26:18.265 --> 01:26:21.135
It's okay. Please.

01:26:21.169 --> 01:26:23.772
Get up here now!

01:26:32.714 --> 01:26:34.815
I love you.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.903
We have an unconscious...
in the rear of the compound.

01:26:55.937 --> 01:26:57.138
<i>What's the code on the suit?</i>

01:26:57.170 --> 01:26:59.006
730-A.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.009
<i>Goddamn it. Are you sure?</i>

01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:02.042
10-4.

01:27:02.076 --> 01:27:03.243
Okay, that's Dr. Chase.

01:27:03.277 --> 01:27:05.080
I need an evac
at the back entrance now!

01:27:05.112 --> 01:27:06.780
Is she still alive?

01:27:06.813 --> 01:27:09.483
She's unconscious, sir.
I think she's infected.

01:27:09.517 --> 01:27:11.486
Bring her to Quarantine A...
for treatment.

01:27:11.519 --> 01:27:14.189
Orders are to keep all infected
outside of the compound.

01:27:14.221 --> 01:27:16.890
<i>I give the orders.
She's the last of the CDC.</i>

01:27:16.924 --> 01:27:18.493
Bring her to Quarantine A!

01:27:18.526 --> 01:27:23.797
Yes, sir. Bringing her in.
Come on.

01:27:23.831 --> 01:27:26.067
Let's move. Let's go.
