00:01.360 --> 00:04.120
(water dripping)

00:14.280 --> 00:16.920
(ominous music)

01:43.960 --> 01:47.180
(doorbell buzzes)

01:47.280 --> 01:49.140
(neighbour speaking in foreign language)

01:49.240 --> 01:52.160
(doorbell buzzing)

01:59.280 --> 02:02.040
(dramatic music)

04:06.440 --> 04:07.980
- [Staff] All right, boss?

04:08.080 --> 04:10.080
- [Emer] Morning, all.

04:15.320 --> 04:18.040
(engine revving)

04:20.120 --> 04:22.640
(tense music)

04:41.320 --> 04:44.000
(tyres screech)

04:48.960 --> 04:50.820
- Main bathroom, top of the stairs.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.020
Master bedroom has an en suite.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.500
So make sure you get to the
top before he starts flushing.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.600
- [Officer] Got it.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.780
(explosion booms)

05:02.880 --> 05:05.380
- [Officer] Go, go, go!

05:05.480 --> 05:07.380
Get down! Get, Get down!

05:07.480 --> 05:09.580
Hands on your heads, stay down!

05:09.680 --> 05:11.680
Don't move.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.460
Kitchen clear!
- Room's clear!

05:14.560 --> 05:16.560
- All clear!
- Clear!

05:22.400 --> 05:24.780
- [Staff] Here we go.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.400
- (clears throat) That
door cost four grand.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.180
You're replacing it.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.300
- Fuck you!
- Keep her in the front room.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.800
- You're fucking paying for it, yeah?

05:34.800 --> 05:37.120
And anything else you break.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.680
- Fuckface.
- Shut the fuck up.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.620
- All right, take it easy.
- Don't touch me!

05:43.720 --> 05:45.700
You're hurting me.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.660
- My name is Detective
Sergeant Emer Berry.

05:47.760 --> 05:48.720
I'm with the Criminal Assets Bureau.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.620
- I want my fucking solicitor.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.100
- I have a warrant, under Section 6

05:52.200 --> 05:54.220
of the Criminal Justice Act 2006,

05:54.320 --> 05:57.180
to execute a search of your
house, garage, and gardens.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.180
We'll be seizing anything

05:58.280 --> 05:59.900
we believe to be the proceeds of crime

06:00.000 --> 06:02.140
or anything purchased
with the proceeds of crime

06:02.240 --> 06:03.940
and any evidence that pertains to such.

06:04.040 --> 06:04.740
- Are you deaf?

06:04.840 --> 06:07.420
I want to call my fucking solicitor.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.460
- We'll be seizing all phones
and electronic devices,

06:09.560 --> 06:11.180
so that'll have to wait.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.280
- Where's your fucking warrant?

06:15.600 --> 06:17.260
- [Emer] This is the original copy,

06:17.360 --> 06:19.360
if you'd like to take a look.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.460
That's your copy.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.560
- We need you downstairs, Emer.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.540
We found another suspect
hiding in the garage.

06:26.640 --> 06:27.940
He's unarmed but aggressive

06:28.040 --> 06:30.980
and refusing to take any
instructions from us.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.480
Says he wants to speak
to the officer in charge.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.240
So maybe if you'd have a word
with him, before we move in.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.500
- Okay.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.120
(baby crying)

06:51.600 --> 06:54.020
I'm Detective Sergeant
Berry, I'm coming in

06:54.120 --> 06:58.480
so stay back from the door
and get down on the ground.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.560
I'm an armed officer,
get down on the ground!

07:07.280 --> 07:08.700
(monkeys chattering)

07:08.800 --> 07:12.400
Jesus!
(officers laughing)

07:14.240 --> 07:16.820
I didn't know it was Bring
Your Kid to Work Day, John.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.920
(officers laughing)

07:20.800 --> 07:25.800
(child babbling)
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.620
Uh, that's my car, you can't take that.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.720
I own that, it's not Darren's.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.600
(tense music)

08:00.960 --> 08:04.560
(cellphone buzzes, chimes)

08:09.560 --> 08:10.820
(cellphone chimes)

08:10.920 --> 08:12.920
- Josh?

08:14.600 --> 08:16.700
This message app just disappeared.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.980
- That shouldn't be happening.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.380
(cellphone chimes)
What the...

08:20.480 --> 08:21.740
Someone's wiping this remotely.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.020
- Can you see who it is?
- I don't think so.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.420
- Try to block them.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.340
- It won't let me shut it down.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.440
- Open up the call log and hold it up.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.980
(camera shutter clicks)
Scroll down.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.180
(camera shutter clicks)
Again.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.540
(cellphone beeping)
- [Josh] Oh, shit.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.260
We're losing them.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.940
- See if there's any
bank apps or any diaries

08:41.040 --> 08:42.460
or anything useful.

08:42.560 --> 08:44.560
- I think they're deleting everything now.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.580
Oh!

08:46.680 --> 08:48.680
It's gone, it's all gone.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.760
(dog barking)

09:04.440 --> 09:06.960
(dog barking)

09:07.960 --> 09:09.380
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Problem?

09:09.480 --> 09:11.140
- It got a scent from the cage.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.020
- [Emer] You sure it's
not doggy monkey issues?

09:14.120 --> 09:18.420
- Could be that, most
definitely got a scent.

09:18.520 --> 09:23.520
- [Emer] Let's open it up.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.120
(mysterious music)

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
- Diamonds.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.680
Unpolished.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.980
(audience applauds)

10:17.080 --> 10:19.880
(up-tempo music)

10:23.440 --> 10:26.440
(audience applauds)

10:51.640 --> 10:54.700
(pedestrian speaking in foreign language)

10:54.800 --> 10:57.480
(tyres screech)

11:04.800 --> 11:07.560
(elevator beeps)

11:22.320 --> 11:24.920
(upbeat music)

11:36.800 --> 11:39.880
(audience applauds)

11:44.960 --> 11:48.280
(hooded figure panting)

12:05.640 --> 12:09.040
(moves into tense music)

12:16.440 --> 12:19.280
(explosion booms)

12:22.800 --> 12:25.800
(debris clattering)

12:37.000 --> 12:39.920
(victims shouting)

12:47.680 --> 12:50.240
(sombre music)

13:14.920 --> 13:19.600
(reporter speaking in foreign language)

14:00.440 --> 14:03.240
(ship horn blows)

14:10.880 --> 14:11.980
(car alarm chirps)

14:12.080 --> 14:16.480
(staff speaking in foreign language)

14:21.640 --> 14:24.180
- [Staff] Captain Koshinen
is waiting upstairs for you.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.280
- Oh, good, thank you.

14:27.560 --> 14:31.960
(staff speaking in foreign language)

14:33.720 --> 14:34.780
(telephone ringing in distance)

14:34.880 --> 14:37.020
Well, if the captain is here
there must be a problem.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.460
- Uh, no.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.460
I brought you a gift.

14:40.560 --> 14:41.340
I was in Cork.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.180
I thought it might be nice to bring you a,

14:43.280 --> 14:45.280
a little taste of home.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.420
- Oh, that's much too generous.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.980
- [Captain] Ah, you take good care of me,

14:50.080 --> 14:51.460
I take good care of you.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.560
- Well, thank you!

14:54.840 --> 14:56.540
Is it too early for a nip?

14:56.640 --> 14:58.660
- It never is.
(Bibi chuckles)

14:58.760 --> 15:00.660
- I saw your ship was in, I
was going to come and see you.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.980
- I saved you the trip, then.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.080
I came in with a purser.

15:07.800 --> 15:08.540
- Well, seeing as you're here,

15:08.640 --> 15:09.740
I wanted to double-check with you

15:09.840 --> 15:11.820
what date you're returning.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.020
- The 27th, I think.
- 27th.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.060
- [Captain] I have the
exact time in my log.

15:16.160 --> 15:16.980
- [Bibi] See you then.

15:17.080 --> 15:17.940
(glasses clink)

15:18.040 --> 15:20.040
- Cheers to you.

15:21.280 --> 15:24.080
(ship horn blows)

15:27.000 --> 15:27.820
- They haven't indicated

15:27.920 --> 15:29.200
whether they're gonna
charge you with anything.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.660
We won't know until they've
gone through all the evidence.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.180
- Some of the stuff they
took, I need it back.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.060
- Unless you can prove it
was something that was bought

15:37.160 --> 15:39.300
with money legally earned,
it won't be returned.

15:39.400 --> 15:42.260
- Um, are they going to
fix the door, at least?

15:42.360 --> 15:44.500
- It was a reinforced door,
and they had a warrant

15:44.600 --> 15:46.540
that allowed them entry to this property.

15:46.640 --> 15:47.540
- They took all our phones.

15:47.640 --> 15:48.780
I need your mobile to make a call.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.100
- Sure, but there will
be an official record

15:51.200 --> 15:53.780
of whoever you're calling on my phone.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.820
- Fuck!

15:55.920 --> 15:58.440
(tense music)

16:23.600 --> 16:25.600
- Thank you.

16:31.160 --> 16:33.760
(keypad beeps)

16:39.800 --> 16:42.620
Good morning, what have we got?

16:42.720 --> 16:43.900
- The translator says

16:44.000 --> 16:46.780
the documents from the
cage are in Flemish.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.420
They're title deeds to
a property in Antwerp.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.820
- Do we have an address?

16:50.920 --> 16:55.980
- Apartment 4, Oostenstraat
53, 2018 Antwerpen.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.080
- [Emer] That's outside our jurisdiction.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.260
Ooh, fancy.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.780
- + It's valued at 1.3 million.

17:05.880 --> 17:07.660
Bought through an Antwerp notary.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.420
- No mortgage.
- When was this?

17:09.520 --> 17:11.540
- [Sean] Little over a year ago.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.060
- Josh, when you went
through his bank accounts,

17:13.160 --> 17:15.020
were there any unusually
large withdrawals?

17:15.120 --> 17:17.020
- Uh, nothing like that amount.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.320
- What about flights to and from Belgium?

17:21.680 --> 17:23.620
So he has luxury apartment in Belgium

17:23.720 --> 17:26.460
and, as far as we know,
didn't view it before buying

17:26.560 --> 17:28.780
or visit afterwards.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.460
That's odd.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.380
And why Antwerp?

17:32.480 --> 17:33.780
I can see someone like Darren Reid

17:33.880 --> 17:37.820
with a pad in Spain or Dubai, but Antwerp?

17:37.920 --> 17:39.420
- He's a drug dealer.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.300
And Antwerp port is a
major hub for smuggling.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.820
- It's also known for its diamonds.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.580
And the two things he
tried hardest to hide

17:46.680 --> 17:50.300
were the diamonds and this apartment.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.380
- Let's see what we can find
out about the apartment.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.940
See is it rented it out,
or is it for personal use?

17:55.040 --> 17:56.380
- If you want to pursue the apartment,

17:56.480 --> 17:58.780
we need to officially contact
the Belgian authorities.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.460
- They're going to be up to
their eyes with that bombing.

18:00.560 --> 18:01.300
- Then we wait,

18:01.400 --> 18:04.300
can't do anything without
Belgian cooperation.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.400
- Okay.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.740
So where are we with the diamonds?

18:08.840 --> 18:10.780
- I left a message with
a broker in Dublin.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.540
I'm hoping they might be
able to give us a valuation.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.540
- It might be better if I
just take them to Antwerp.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.860
The chances are they're from there, too,

18:17.960 --> 18:20.260
and there may be records.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.220
You know you can't go near that apartment

18:22.320 --> 18:23.380
while you're there?

18:23.480 --> 18:25.480
- Not our jurisdiction.

18:44.160 --> 18:48.800
(reporter speaking in foreign language)

19:27.200 --> 19:31.880
(reporter speaking in foreign language)

19:35.880 --> 19:40.360
(Viktor speaking in foreign language)

19:54.280 --> 19:57.200
(insects chirping)

20:06.520 --> 20:08.920
(door thuds)

20:17.560 --> 20:19.560
- Hello.
- Hi.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.100
- Hey, my father called today

20:27.200 --> 20:29.940
to remind me we were
all meeting on Thursday.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.820
He was very, uh,

20:31.920 --> 20:34.280
cloak and dagger about the whole thing.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.320
You know what that was about?

20:37.680 --> 20:39.660
- No.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.140
- What is he even doing in Belgium?

20:42.240 --> 20:44.140
You know it's not a social visit.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.240
- I don't know.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.780
Have you been watching the news coverage

20:52.880 --> 20:54.880
of yesterday's bombing?

20:55.200 --> 20:57.420
- A little, it's awful.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.520
- They're trying to identify a woman.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.740
She worked for me.

21:03.840 --> 21:04.820
- [James] What?

21:04.920 --> 21:06.920
Have you told the police?

21:08.480 --> 21:10.420
- No.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.520
- How come?

21:12.960 --> 21:14.740
- How many companies
will want to work with us

21:14.840 --> 21:17.860
if they think we're linked
to a terrorist attack?

21:17.960 --> 21:20.140
- You're hardly "linked to the attack."

21:20.240 --> 21:22.240
- Well, that's how it will look like.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
We have access to the whole port.

21:25.760 --> 21:28.160
Imagine how useful that
could be to a terrorist.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.500
- I'll cancel the restaurant.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.760
We'll come up with a plan.

21:37.520 --> 21:42.520
(sirens wailing)
(tense music)

22:38.800 --> 22:41.640
(doorbell buzzes)

22:52.360 --> 22:53.380
- [Occupant] Hello?

22:53.480 --> 22:56.160
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, a little.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.900
- I'm here to see my
friend in apartment 2,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.280
but I don't think her intercom is working.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.760
(door buzzing)
Thank you.

23:18.200 --> 23:21.200
(suspenseful music)

24:15.880 --> 24:18.880
(suspenseful music)

24:23.120 --> 24:24.500
(police speaking in foreign language)

24:24.600 --> 24:26.600
I speak English.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.220
I speak English!

24:29.320 --> 24:30.540
English.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.660
I'm a police officer.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.740
I'm a police officer from Ireland.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.100
(handcuffs click)

24:37.200 --> 24:39.220
- Can you prove this?

24:39.320 --> 24:43.160
- My passport and my police
ID are in my bag, there.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.960
(siren wails)

25:13.320 --> 25:15.800
- [Officer] Follow me, please.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.180
- Our Embassy in Dublin

25:49.280 --> 25:51.780
contacted your bosses
to confirm your story.

25:51.880 --> 25:52.820
- Hm.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.860
I bet that went down well.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.140
- Yeah, well, uh, I made it clear

25:57.240 --> 26:00.140
you actually had done us a
favour turning up like that.

26:00.240 --> 26:02.360
- I'm guessing this is about the bombings?

26:04.240 --> 26:08.120
I saw the apartment is a
crime scene, and this is CTU.

26:10.800 --> 26:11.900
- The man who owns the apartment,

26:12.000 --> 26:13.820
what can you tell us about him?

26:13.920 --> 26:16.300
- Darren Reid, Irish drug dealer.

26:16.400 --> 26:20.240
Lots of cash, flash
cars, and a pet monkey.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.620
- Pet monkey, what is that, is that slang?

26:23.720 --> 26:26.760
- No, he owns pet monkeys.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.880
- Okay.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.860
He came to our attention
when his bank tipped us off

26:34.960 --> 26:37.380
about unusual financial behaviour.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.860
Large amounts were passing
through his accounts

26:39.960 --> 26:42.100
that originated from the Philippines.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.780
As far as we know, he bought the apartment

26:43.880 --> 26:47.100
without even seeing it
and has never used it.

26:47.200 --> 26:50.360
None of this is normal for
someone like Darren Reid.

26:53.960 --> 26:57.320
I want to know what he's
doing and seize his assets.

26:58.280 --> 27:01.560
And if we can help each
other, even better.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.480
- Okay.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.660
The suicide bomber who carried out

27:10.760 --> 27:12.100
the attack here in Antwerp,

27:12.200 --> 27:15.100
he stayed in the apartment
the night before.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.200
- Shit.
- Yeah.

27:17.840 --> 27:20.980
We believe this is where he
prepared for the bombing.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.540
We also found the body of a woman

27:22.640 --> 27:24.340
who had been murdered in the bathroom.

27:24.440 --> 27:27.820
May have been his girlfriend
or a co-conspirator.

27:27.920 --> 27:30.460
A neighbour disturbed a number
of men inside the apartment.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.980
They had to leave in a hurry.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.120
We had hoped they may return.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
- But you caught me instead?
- Yeah.

27:40.480 --> 27:44.220
This Darren Reid guy, does he
have any links to terrorism?

27:44.320 --> 27:45.220
- Not that I know of

27:45.320 --> 27:47.620
and certainly not
Islamic terrorist groups.

27:47.720 --> 27:50.040
- We're not sure these
terrorists are Islamic.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.300
- That's not what the news is saying.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.460
- Yeah, well.

27:54.560 --> 27:55.860
CCTV showed the bomber

27:55.960 --> 27:58.320
making the sign of the
cross before detonating.

28:00.360 --> 28:01.900
Your suspect, does,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.220
is he aware that you
know of the apartment?

28:04.320 --> 28:05.620
- Yeah.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.220
We found the deeds during
a raid on his house.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.560
They were hidden with
a quantity of diamonds.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.980
- Like this one?
- Yeah.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.080
There was 47 of them like that.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.380
That's the reason why I'm here.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.480
To find out about the diamonds.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.280
- Follow me, please.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.140
Wait in here, please.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.060
- Thanks for doing this.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.160
What time do you have to be back at?

28:45.080 --> 28:47.780
Uh, when I'll have a moment
I'll help you with the diamonds.

28:47.880 --> 28:49.700
- Can I at least have my phone back?

28:49.800 --> 28:51.580
- Sorry, that's being processed.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.980
- Well, what am I supposed to do here?

28:54.080 --> 28:56.260
- Yeah, well, uh, read a magazine.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.360
I'll send someone over with some coffee.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.740
- [Emer] Thanks!

29:00.840 --> 29:02.580
- In the interest of clarification,

29:02.680 --> 29:05.260
are you here as a husband
or as your wife's lawyer?

29:05.360 --> 29:06.260
- Husband.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.740
I don't believe my wife requires a lawyer.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.840
She couldn't afford me anyway.

29:12.360 --> 29:15.060
- I believe you have
information about the woman

29:15.160 --> 29:17.160
we're trying to identify.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.460
- Her name is Sana Retz.

29:20.560 --> 29:23.260
She worked for my company
for a short while.

29:23.360 --> 29:24.980
- When exactly was this?

29:25.080 --> 29:26.740
- She started about four months ago,

29:26.840 --> 29:29.120
and stayed right up until the other day.

29:30.440 --> 29:32.500
- What exactly does your company do?

29:32.600 --> 29:33.980
- We're ship chandlers.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.020
We service the ships in the port.

29:36.120 --> 29:39.820
Anything they need,
food, cleaning supplies,

29:39.920 --> 29:42.660
electronics, and we provide it.

29:42.760 --> 29:44.900
Sana worked in the warehouse.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.720
- Did she have family or friends?

29:48.760 --> 29:50.760
- Honestly, I, I don't know.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.540
- Since we released that
sketch of her yesterday,

29:54.640 --> 29:56.840
you're the only person
to have come forward.

29:57.720 --> 30:01.080
That is strange if she was
living here and working.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.260
- I suspect Sana was an illegal.

30:06.360 --> 30:10.760
So family or friends might
be reluctant to come forward.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.860
- And what makes you
think she was an illegal?

30:14.960 --> 30:16.820
- Well, she was only with
us for a short period,

30:16.920 --> 30:19.580
but any time we asked
for her work permits,

30:19.680 --> 30:22.460
she always had an excuse.

30:22.560 --> 30:25.240
She either had forgotten
them or lost them.

30:26.840 --> 30:29.180
I had to have a word with
her about it last week.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.220
When she didn't show up for work,

30:30.320 --> 30:35.260
I thought that was why until
I saw her picture on the news.

30:35.360 --> 30:38.740
- How is it you ended up
employing an illegal immigrant?

30:38.840 --> 30:40.180
- I'll remind you, Chief Inspector,

30:40.280 --> 30:42.060
that my wife is here voluntarily

30:42.160 --> 30:44.420
to help you with your investigation.

30:44.520 --> 30:45.980
You want to ask her about anything else,

30:46.080 --> 30:48.400
you can formally invite
her to be interviewed.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.220
- I'm only interested
in catching the people

30:51.320 --> 30:53.320
behind these attacks.

30:55.360 --> 31:00.100
- I saw Sana in a coffee
shop in town asking for work.

31:00.200 --> 31:04.260
We got talking, I liked her,
and I offered her a job.

31:04.360 --> 31:05.500
- So you just offer this woman

31:05.600 --> 31:07.780
you met in a coffee shop a job?

31:07.880 --> 31:10.280
- No, I told you, I spoke with her first.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.540
She told me she had travelled
from Syria with her family.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.640
- She was Syrian?
- Yes.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.420
Her father drowned when the boat capsized

31:20.520 --> 31:23.060
on the crossing from Turkey,
and after they were rescued,

31:23.160 --> 31:25.700
her youngest brother was sent
to a different holding camp.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.920
She'd been trying to trace him for months.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.860
- And you believed all this?

31:30.960 --> 31:32.700
- If I met you and you
told me your life story,

31:32.800 --> 31:35.220
should I suspect you of lying?

31:35.320 --> 31:37.320
Or is that just immigrants?

31:39.720 --> 31:41.740
- You're Irish?

31:41.840 --> 31:43.220
- I was born and brought up in Ireland,

31:43.320 --> 31:45.100
but I have joint Irish
Canadian citizenship

31:45.200 --> 31:47.060
through marriage.

31:47.160 --> 31:49.160
- Do you know a man called Darren Reid?

31:50.560 --> 31:52.560
- No. Why?

32:15.640 --> 32:17.640
- Fucks sake!

32:31.440 --> 32:33.300
- Does your company
deliver all over the port?

32:33.400 --> 32:35.260
- [Bibi] Yeah.

32:35.360 --> 32:38.340
- So, uh, your employees,
they can access anywhere?

32:38.440 --> 32:39.620
- Well, the delivery drivers can,

32:39.720 --> 32:41.620
but Sana only worked nights
here in the warehouse,

32:41.720 --> 32:43.720
so this is all she had access to.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.380
Carolyn, can you please
get Chief Inspector De Jong

32:49.480 --> 32:51.380
the information we have on Sana Retz

32:51.480 --> 32:53.260
and help him with anything else he needs.

32:53.360 --> 32:54.460
- Yes, Mevrouw Melnick.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.460
- I hope you don't mind,
but I have a call scheduled.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.920
- If we need anything
else, we'll let you know.

33:05.840 --> 33:10.840
(Carolyn and officers
speaking in foreign language)

34:04.200 --> 34:06.200
- Are you hungry?

34:07.880 --> 34:10.660
Well, it's kind of a local delicacy.

34:10.760 --> 34:13.640
It's, uh, yep, grey shrimp.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.720
We say "une croquette".

34:19.000 --> 34:21.080
- Basically a fancy fish finger.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.360
- You don't like it?

34:25.400 --> 34:27.800
- I would have liked it
much more two hours ago.

34:28.640 --> 34:31.860
- I'll finish it for you,
I'm as hungry as a horse.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.100
That's true.

34:34.200 --> 34:37.340
So, uh, the Criminal Assets
Bureau, your department,

34:37.440 --> 34:39.440
what is that exactly?

34:39.840 --> 34:42.300
- We target criminals and
seize anything they own

34:42.400 --> 34:45.060
that we believe might be
the proceeds of crime;

34:45.160 --> 34:50.160
houses, cars, cash, bank
accounts, watches, anything.

34:51.080 --> 34:53.260
- So you're like an accountant?

34:53.360 --> 34:55.540
- I'm a police detective.

34:55.640 --> 34:57.640
- Who investigates assets and money?

34:59.400 --> 35:01.900
- I was in Serious Crime
until eight months ago.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.820
And I know that CAB has greater powers

35:03.920 --> 35:06.540
than any other unit I've ever worked in.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.800
We get the targets and their money.

35:10.600 --> 35:13.400
- The accountant squad. (chuckles)

35:15.360 --> 35:17.360
- Passport, please.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.100
Place your right index finger on there

35:20.200 --> 35:21.860
and look into that camera.

35:21.960 --> 35:24.300
(device beeping)

35:24.400 --> 35:27.000
- If you have any dark
secrets, it will show up now.

35:28.480 --> 35:30.940
- Aren't they interested in your secrets?

35:31.040 --> 35:33.520
- It's okay, they already know all mine.

35:42.680 --> 35:43.660
And there's no Kimberley,

35:43.760 --> 35:46.460
it was seized from a criminal in Ireland.

35:46.560 --> 35:47.780
- Mm, without a Kimberley certificate

35:47.880 --> 35:50.140
I cannot tell you where it came from.

35:50.240 --> 35:53.140
But if I had to guess,
I'd probably say Angola.

35:53.240 --> 35:54.980
- And how much is it worth?

35:55.080 --> 35:57.360
- Mm, colours are a good G.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.260
Clarity is excellent,

36:00.360 --> 36:02.940
and there are some
inclusions which I like.

36:03.040 --> 36:06.820
I'd say they're round G 4.18 VVS.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.260
How many did you say there are?

36:08.360 --> 36:10.360
- 47.
- 47.

36:13.360 --> 36:14.660
Well, if they're all like this I would say

36:14.760 --> 36:17.280
they are worth about 600,000, maybe more.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.360
- Thank you.

36:25.080 --> 36:27.880
- If diamonds didn't exist,
criminals would invent them.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.320
So easy to hide and transport.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.500
And turn them into cash
without a paper trail.

36:34.600 --> 36:37.760
The perfect currency for
crime and terrorists.

36:41.160 --> 36:42.700
Your guy had a bag full of diamonds,

36:42.800 --> 36:44.960
and his apartment was
used by my terrorist.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.740
We need to question him.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.840
- I'm sure that could be arranged.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.700
- Getting permission
to interview a suspect

36:52.800 --> 36:55.660
in another jurisdiction
takes more time than I have.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.140
- Well, perhaps I could interview him,

36:57.240 --> 36:59.620
and you can come observe.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.720
Even suggest a line of questioning?

37:03.880 --> 37:05.880
- That would be very helpful.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.420
When you were investigating
this Darren Reid,

37:09.520 --> 37:11.760
did the name Bibi Melnick ever come up?

37:13.360 --> 37:14.180
- No. Why?

37:14.280 --> 37:15.460
(cellphone rings)

37:15.560 --> 37:17.220
- One second.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.320
Yeah? Christian.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.260
Okay.

37:23.360 --> 37:24.940
Uh, I have to go.

37:25.040 --> 37:27.440
You can make your own way
to the airport, right?

37:29.480 --> 37:31.480
- Yeah. Right.

37:34.120 --> 37:36.640
(tense music)

37:37.680 --> 37:42.360
(officers speaking in foreign language)

38:20.760 --> 38:22.760
- Clear!
- Clear!

38:30.960 --> 38:31.840
(officer speaking in foreign language)

38:31.920 --> 38:33.420
- Fuck!

38:33.520 --> 38:38.200
(officers speaking in foreign language)

38:50.960 --> 38:52.960
- All clear.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.420
- Norah, call Judge Martin's
registrar and notify her

38:59.520 --> 39:01.540
that we'll be making an
emergency application

39:01.640 --> 39:03.900
to her first thing in the morning.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.700
Yeah, now.

39:05.800 --> 39:08.780
It's only 9:30. She's
hardly in bed already.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.540
I'll do up the application
when I get home.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.900
Just get us on her list, will you?

39:13.000 --> 39:15.920
(car alarm chirps)

39:19.640 --> 39:21.820
Oh, shit!

39:21.920 --> 39:26.520
Customer number is 3-6-3-3-2-6.

39:27.600 --> 39:31.040
I've got a flat tyre, and
I'm in the airport car park.

39:33.760 --> 39:34.900
Seriously.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
How long?

39:37.360 --> 39:39.360
Is he walking here?

39:39.760 --> 39:42.200
(Emer sighs)

39:47.200 --> 39:50.120
(cellphone chimes)

39:56.560 --> 40:00.160
(aeroplane engine whirring)

40:04.320 --> 40:07.520
(Emer exhales deeply)

40:09.120 --> 40:11.600
(Emer grunts)

40:23.600 --> 40:26.320
(tools clanging)

40:55.440 --> 40:58.560
- Seeing that I was woken
for this, it better be good.

41:00.720 --> 41:03.540
- We are seeking an
order under Section 67,

41:03.640 --> 41:06.260
sub-section 4 of the
Criminal Justice Act 2010,

41:06.360 --> 41:09.620
pertaining to Money Laundering
and Terrorist Financing,

41:09.720 --> 41:12.500
to compel the telecoms
companies listed in Appendix 1,

41:12.600 --> 41:14.260
to provide us with the personal details

41:14.360 --> 41:15.380
of all the account holders

41:15.480 --> 41:18.380
of all the numbers listed in Appendix 2.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.340
We believe the discovery of the deeds

41:20.440 --> 41:21.740
to a property in Antwerp

41:21.840 --> 41:25.240
and diamonds concealed at Mr.
Reid's house are significant.

41:26.280 --> 41:29.060
- These print outs in
Appendix 4 are what exactly?

41:29.160 --> 41:30.740
- They're copies of
photos of the phone log

41:30.840 --> 41:32.220
taken on Mr. Reid's phone.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.660
It was being wiped remotely
when we were seizing it.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.120
This was our only way of
recording the numbers.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.800
- Hm.

41:42.440 --> 41:45.580
You state that the apartment
in Antwerp owned by Mr. Reid

41:45.680 --> 41:47.620
was being used for terrorist activities,

41:47.720 --> 41:51.280
but I don't see any evidence
to support this claim.

41:54.360 --> 41:55.700
- It was where the terrorist

41:55.800 --> 41:58.660
that carried out the
Antwerp bombing was staying.

41:58.760 --> 42:01.500
The Belgian police found
the body of a woman there.

42:01.600 --> 42:04.100
I could seek official
confirmation from Antwerp,

42:04.200 --> 42:06.860
but it is imperative
that this investigation

42:06.960 --> 42:09.420
is not delayed while we wait.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.540
There's an officer coming from

42:10.640 --> 42:12.500
the Belgian Counter
Terrorist Unit tomorrow

42:12.600 --> 42:14.600
to observe our questioning of Reid.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.640
(soft music)

42:53.560 --> 42:55.560
- So I open the app, you
know, to do the exercises,

42:56.120 --> 42:57.740
like every other day,

42:57.840 --> 43:00.800
and Aoife says she doesn't
believe in mindfulness.

43:01.960 --> 43:06.620
And I say, "Mindfulness isn't
like the Tooth Fairy or UFOs,

43:06.720 --> 43:08.740
it exists, how can you not believe in it?"

43:08.840 --> 43:12.000
And she says she thinks
mindfulness is evil.

43:14.280 --> 43:16.280
- That escalated quickly.

43:17.600 --> 43:20.820
- Her theory is that
mindfulness perpetuates the idea

43:20.920 --> 43:23.580
that all our problems are within ourselves

43:23.680 --> 43:27.100
and can be fixed with a few
minutes of meditation every day,

43:27.200 --> 43:29.300
which distracts us from the truth,

43:29.400 --> 43:31.860
which is that the world we're
living in is the real problem

43:31.960 --> 43:33.100
and we're being screwed over

43:33.200 --> 43:36.280
by corporations and
governments all the time.

43:38.080 --> 43:39.820
- Fuck!

43:39.920 --> 43:42.100
She might have a point.

43:42.200 --> 43:44.220
- That's what I thought.

43:44.320 --> 43:46.540
Now that's all I can think of
when I'm doing my exercises.

43:46.640 --> 43:47.940
She's ruined mindfulness for me.

43:48.040 --> 43:50.560
(Emer laughs)

43:53.120 --> 43:55.260
I wouldn't mind, but
the app cost me 15.99.

43:55.360 --> 43:58.180
(Emer laughs)

43:58.280 --> 44:00.280
- Oh, here we go.

44:06.680 --> 44:08.180
Nice car.

44:08.280 --> 44:10.580
- It's a rental, I have the contracts.

44:10.680 --> 44:12.220
- Relax, we're only here to tell you

44:12.320 --> 44:14.020
we'd like to interview you about issues

44:14.120 --> 44:16.540
arising from the search of your property.

44:16.640 --> 44:20.100
Ideally we'd like you to present
to the station voluntarily.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.300
Or, if not, we can issue
a warrant for your arrest.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.500
Up to you.

44:24.600 --> 44:25.580
- When?

44:25.680 --> 44:27.680
- Tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m.

44:30.600 --> 44:33.180
I'd also like to inform you
that a Belgian police officer

44:33.280 --> 44:35.280
will be observing the interview.

44:36.320 --> 44:37.300
- What for?

44:37.400 --> 44:38.660
- The apartment you own in Antwerp

44:38.760 --> 44:40.760
is under their jurisdiction.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.180
- But what's this got to do with them?

44:43.280 --> 44:45.460
It's not an offence to own an apartment.

44:45.560 --> 44:48.040
- We'll discuss all that
at the interview, shall we?

44:58.840 --> 45:00.780
- You see his face when
you mentioned Belgium?

45:00.880 --> 45:02.020
- Yep.

45:02.120 --> 45:04.260
More scared than guilty I'd say.

45:04.360 --> 45:06.360
- Definitely.

45:34.120 --> 45:36.640
(tense music)

46:20.800 --> 46:22.800
- It's me, I need to see you.

46:23.520 --> 46:25.380
(sighs) That's too late.

46:25.480 --> 46:26.780
CAB are hauling me in tomorrow about it.

46:26.880 --> 46:28.700
They're all over the apartment.

46:28.800 --> 46:31.100
No, I won't fucking calm down.

46:31.200 --> 46:34.060
It's not your name that is
on the fucking title deeds.

46:34.160 --> 46:36.060
This is not what I fucking signed up for.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.180
And I'll tell you this now.

46:38.280 --> 46:40.060
I'm not taking the rap for anyone.

46:40.160 --> 46:42.160
That clear?

46:51.760 --> 46:54.760
(ship horn blowing)

46:56.800 --> 46:58.420
(door knocking)

46:58.520 --> 47:00.100
- What is it?

47:00.200 --> 47:02.340
- The port authority just called.

47:02.440 --> 47:04.300
They want you to remain here,

47:04.400 --> 47:05.780
as they're sending over an officer

47:05.880 --> 47:08.900
from their Department of
Security to interview you.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.660
- This is because of what's in the papers?

47:11.760 --> 47:13.760
- Yeah.

47:28.520 --> 47:29.700
- Reid's late.

47:29.800 --> 47:31.300
- Only a few minutes.

47:31.400 --> 47:34.140
- Norah, call his solicitor
and see if he's coming.

47:34.240 --> 47:35.980
- [Right] Right.

47:36.080 --> 47:38.020
- Tell her if she can't
verify his whereabouts,

47:38.120 --> 47:40.740
we'll assume he's absconded
and issue an arrest warrant.

47:40.840 --> 47:43.580
Notify the airports and
ferries immediately.

47:43.680 --> 47:46.060
It's going straight to voice mail.

47:46.160 --> 47:47.780
- Will I get an arrest warrant?

47:47.880 --> 47:49.060
(car horn honks)

47:49.160 --> 47:49.900
- Hang on.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.320
(camera shutter clicks)

47:59.160 --> 48:01.160
It's him.

48:03.520 --> 48:07.200
(motorcycle engine revving)

48:09.760 --> 48:12.280
(tense music)

48:16.880 --> 48:19.200
(gun bangs)

48:20.760 --> 48:23.440
(guns banging)

48:37.160 --> 48:40.160
(suspenseful music)
