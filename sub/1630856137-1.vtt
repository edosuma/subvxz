00:29.375 --> 00:34.750
LAST CALL FOR ISTANBUL

02:43.125 --> 02:47.250
I felt something strange
when I first saw her.

02:47.833 --> 02:49.166
I was bedazzled.

02:51.291 --> 02:55.375
Then the voice inside of me said,
"Mehmet, this is it.

02:55.458 --> 02:58.791
She's the one you've been looking for.
Don't look any further."

03:13.125 --> 03:15.166
If she hadn't come into my life,

03:16.166 --> 03:18.250
I would have been somewhere else now.

04:11.708 --> 04:13.458
-So, someone took my luggage?

04:15.041 --> 04:16.291
Sorry, are you Turkish?

04:18.458 --> 04:22.791
That sounded silly. You just…
You just spoke Turkish.

04:22.875 --> 04:24.125
I saw your suitcase,

04:24.625 --> 04:27.750
but I was with the security,
so, I couldn't get to it.

04:28.375 --> 04:30.083
It's not your fault.

04:31.125 --> 04:33.916
If I lose my suitcase,
I'm finished, totally ruined.

04:34.541 --> 04:38.041
Calm down. Whoever took it
will eventually realize it's not theirs.

04:39.083 --> 04:44.666
Did you have your phone number
or address on it?

04:45.416 --> 04:47.333
My phone and purse are in there.

04:49.458 --> 04:51.333
Does it have a tag on it?

04:52.625 --> 04:53.458
Yes.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.625
-But it's worn.
-May I?

05:02.333 --> 05:03.416
Thank you so much.

05:03.916 --> 05:06.291
My pleasure. We'll find it. Don't worry.

05:09.125 --> 05:09.958
It's ringing.

05:19.625 --> 05:22.125
Answering machine. "Dragon Gift Shop."

05:22.208 --> 05:24.166
Then stuff in Chinese. Didn't get it.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.625
A shop in Manhattan. Close to Chinatown.

05:35.791 --> 05:38.000
How am I supposed to go to Chinatown?

05:38.583 --> 05:41.791
I'm going that way, actually.

05:43.375 --> 05:45.250
Well, somewhere close by.

05:45.333 --> 05:49.000
-I can give you a lift if you like.
-You're going to Chinatown?

05:49.875 --> 05:52.083
Or are you just trying to be helpful?

05:53.166 --> 05:54.833
Does it matter?

05:56.458 --> 05:59.291
No, you've already flown
for hours. Thank you.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.416
-I'll manage.
-I don't mind it.

06:01.500 --> 06:05.875
I'll take you there, we'll sort it out,
and I'll go on my way. No problem.

06:08.916 --> 06:12.416
When I first saw him,
it felt like I'd already known him.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.500
You probably regret crossing paths.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.583
No. I've been in the same situation
a few times.

06:19.916 --> 06:23.583
You know that feeling of,
"I'll have a story with this guy"?

06:23.666 --> 06:24.750
That's how I felt.

06:25.250 --> 06:26.125
Let's go.

06:27.708 --> 06:30.750
Sometimes I wonder
what my life would've been like

06:30.833 --> 06:33.875
if I hadn't met him that day,
hadn't gone with him.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.916
This place feels familiar,
like I've been here before.

07:49.416 --> 07:52.375
Must be the hundreds of films
I've watched.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.875
Yeah, it's normal after watching so many.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.750
-This is the place.
-Is it?

07:59.375 --> 08:03.000
You can try this for sore throat.
It's very effective.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.291
You will see the prices
are all shown there.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.625
Thank God you brought it.

08:14.708 --> 08:15.541
Let me take it.

08:20.958 --> 08:21.791
Fenhua!

08:22.625 --> 08:23.625
What?

08:23.708 --> 08:26.416
-Come here, quick. Hurry!
-What is it?

08:35.458 --> 08:38.250
Give Dad a call. They want their luggage.

08:50.041 --> 08:54.000
Hello? Oh, somebody has brought
your luggage here.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.500
Where are you?

08:56.583 --> 08:59.166
Alright. I'll let them know. Bye.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.166
Now what?

09:12.375 --> 09:14.000
Now we'll go to that hotel.

09:15.666 --> 09:17.750
No, you must be tired. No need.

09:17.833 --> 09:19.458
Nonsense. We came all this way.

09:19.541 --> 09:21.416
I won't leave until we get it.

09:21.916 --> 09:25.250
I'm a bit hungry, though.
Shall we grab something?

09:26.875 --> 09:27.750
Okay.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.958
You can add it to my tab.

09:46.583 --> 09:51.666
I see. You found a good way
to finance your New York trip.

09:53.250 --> 09:58.666
Yeah. I came to New York to con strangers
and make them chase after my luggage.

10:00.125 --> 10:02.416
You don't need to con anyone.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.833
There must be millions of guys here
who'd buy you dinner.

10:05.916 --> 10:07.333
Was that a compliment?

10:07.416 --> 10:09.416
No, of course not.

10:09.916 --> 10:11.666
Are you flirting with me?

10:12.416 --> 10:15.208
-Definitely not. I'm married.
-Oh, good.

10:16.625 --> 10:19.833
-Don't get me wrong. I'm married too.
-All good then.

11:54.625 --> 11:57.125
-You'll stay here?
-What choice do I have?

11:57.208 --> 11:59.875
Are you sure?
We could look for another place.

12:24.125 --> 12:25.875
I should set you free now.

12:25.958 --> 12:28.666
-Thank you so much.
-Yes, time to say goodbye.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.541
Yes, go to your friend.
I kept you too long.

12:32.625 --> 12:36.166
No, it was a pleasure. I should thank you.

12:36.666 --> 12:38.625
Okay. Have fun in New York.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.791
Same. And good luck
with your job interview.

12:42.291 --> 12:43.375
Thank you.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.000
-Nice meeting you.
-Same.

12:47.708 --> 12:49.333
Can I have your phone--

12:49.416 --> 12:52.375
What if he doesn't bring
your suitcase tomorrow?

12:53.666 --> 12:54.750
I don't know.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.750
What do you suggest we do?

13:18.166 --> 13:19.041
Are you sure?

13:20.708 --> 13:25.625
I came all this way. I have to stay
in the room that John Lennon stayed in.

13:50.833 --> 13:54.875
I'll have a drink at the rooftop.
Since she highly recommended it.

13:55.375 --> 13:56.875
Feel free to join.

13:58.125 --> 14:00.083
No, I better not.

14:00.708 --> 14:03.333
-Why?
-I'll get some rest.

14:03.875 --> 14:05.041
Is something wrong?

14:06.666 --> 14:09.666
I mean, New York,
rooftop, having drinks together…

14:11.750 --> 14:12.583
So?

14:15.166 --> 14:16.791
It will be a huge mistake.

14:18.208 --> 14:21.875
What do you mean, a huge mistake?
We'll have drinks, that's all.

14:39.333 --> 14:41.500
Let's say I joined you for a drink,

14:42.333 --> 14:43.833
what would your wife say?

14:45.208 --> 14:46.291
What do you mean?

14:47.708 --> 14:50.541
Is there any reason for my wife
to say something?

14:51.333 --> 14:52.833
I don't know. Is there?

14:54.666 --> 14:55.541
I don't think so.

14:56.958 --> 14:57.791
No.

15:09.083 --> 15:13.041
Rest assured, I'm not a guy
who'd cheat on his wife. Ever.

15:14.708 --> 15:16.458
Big words.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.000
Not if you know yourself.

15:26.083 --> 15:28.750
I seriously don't have
any other intentions.

15:28.833 --> 15:32.875
I'll be upstairs having a drink.
You're welcome to join.

15:39.791 --> 15:41.416
I understand that you don't.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.125
But what if I have?

19:26.666 --> 19:30.083
-Rock star! Drinking water?
-I was just waiting for you.

19:31.291 --> 19:34.458
If I had known you'd dress up,
I would have too.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.916
Where did you get this?

19:36.875 --> 19:38.791
From downstairs. She's amazing.

19:38.875 --> 19:40.958
She sells lost items down there.

19:41.041 --> 19:44.083
-You have to check the stuff she has.
-Great.

19:44.625 --> 19:45.916
You seem happy.

19:46.916 --> 19:49.208
-I'll be even happier once I drink.
-Sure.

20:23.208 --> 20:25.666
So, what is it that you design?

20:26.333 --> 20:27.416
Started with jewelry.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.708
Now I design
hair accessories and bridal headpieces.

20:32.208 --> 20:35.625
I collaborated with a brand in Milan,
then in London.

20:35.708 --> 20:38.583
-And now, here I am.
-So, you're quite good at it.

20:38.666 --> 20:40.875
I don't get this stuff, but still…

20:48.500 --> 20:50.708
I feel like calling you "Ryan."

20:54.041 --> 20:56.583
Okay. Good. That suits me.

20:58.875 --> 21:00.291
What should I call you?

21:15.125 --> 21:17.125
Ryan, why don't we make a deal?

21:18.375 --> 21:20.541
We'll be together until I get my luggage.

21:20.625 --> 21:23.666
We won't meet again.
No calling, no stalking on social media.

21:27.208 --> 21:30.833
-Why are we doing this?
-To have more fun, to get comfortable.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.208
If not, we will overthink this.

21:37.958 --> 21:39.958
Well, you're an interesting woman.

21:43.083 --> 21:43.916
Sorry.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.500
IF YOU'RE FREE, MAY I CALL YOU?
I'M NOT FREE, EDA.

21:54.708 --> 21:56.625
Being phone-free feels great.

21:57.666 --> 21:58.750
You should try it.

22:02.291 --> 22:03.291
Deal.

22:22.083 --> 22:24.416
We've been together for ten years. You?

22:25.083 --> 22:26.458
We've been together…

22:28.458 --> 22:29.833
since college.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.833
-Any children?
-No.

22:34.541 --> 22:36.708
But…

22:38.291 --> 22:40.416
I want kids. I want to be a father.

22:41.625 --> 22:42.583
Do you have any?

22:43.333 --> 22:44.833
I'm not ready yet.

22:45.416 --> 22:49.791
Kids? We can barely manage ourselves.
There are things I'd like to do.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.625
If your husband agrees, it's fine.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.708
Well, I don't know if he agrees.

22:59.250 --> 23:02.458
When you're in a long-term relationship,

23:03.333 --> 23:05.500
you can't tell if it is love or habit.

23:05.583 --> 23:06.875
Do you ever feel that?

23:08.208 --> 23:10.791
If that's what you're saying,
you have a problem.

23:11.875 --> 23:12.708
Why is that?

23:13.333 --> 23:15.333
If you really love someone,

23:17.333 --> 23:19.166
you don't question it.

23:19.708 --> 23:23.041
A relationship is something
that shouldn't be questioned.

23:23.125 --> 23:24.208
If you ask me.

23:24.291 --> 23:27.916
I disagree.
You shouldn't take it for granted.

23:29.333 --> 23:33.333
Haven't you ever gotten sick
of being with the same woman for years?

23:33.416 --> 23:34.250
No.

23:34.875 --> 23:35.875
Come on.

23:38.333 --> 23:42.333
You apparently got sick of it.
Must be why you came to New York alone.

23:42.916 --> 23:47.083
In order to be creative,
I have to ditch that routine.

23:47.166 --> 23:50.958
Exploring a different city,
meeting people.

23:51.916 --> 23:52.916
And I guess…

23:54.625 --> 23:57.416
I feel the need to remember
that I have options.

23:58.666 --> 24:00.041
Why did you come alone?

24:02.375 --> 24:04.333
I came to blow off some steam.

24:04.416 --> 24:06.166
I thought I'd feel good here.

24:07.666 --> 24:10.916
-Let's blow off steam, then.
-Yes! To blowing off steam.

24:20.375 --> 24:22.125
I find fidelity overrated.

24:22.625 --> 24:23.458
You do?

24:24.250 --> 24:27.208
-Haven't you ever cheated on your wife?
-I haven't.

24:29.375 --> 24:30.416
Get it all out.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.750
You won't see me again.

24:51.916 --> 24:53.458
You didn't answer my question.

24:53.541 --> 24:56.166
I did, but you wouldn't take the answer.

25:02.916 --> 25:06.000
You see, if I wanted to cheat,
I wouldn't have gotten married.

25:06.708 --> 25:10.041
If I felt like cheating,
I would get divorced right away.

25:11.333 --> 25:15.708
If you're happy, if you love your partner,
and, most of all, respect them,

25:15.791 --> 25:18.416
cheating is out of the question.
That's it.

25:19.750 --> 25:20.916
What else?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.333
Nothing.

25:23.791 --> 25:27.208
-What do you mean?
-Do you have any other clichés?

25:27.291 --> 25:30.708
"Lovers don't cheat. Cheaters don't love."
Shoot them all.

25:30.791 --> 25:34.041
-Then we can start talking.
-Why would I lie to you?

25:34.125 --> 25:36.750
Exactly. No need to be uptight.

25:37.250 --> 25:40.166
Yeah, theoretically,
no one gets married to cheat.

25:40.250 --> 25:43.666
But there are times
you get bored of yourself, of your job,

25:43.750 --> 25:46.083
of where you live in, of your clothes…

25:47.916 --> 25:51.166
Our relationships don't work
because we fool ourselves.

25:52.541 --> 25:57.625
If we could feel free in a relationship,
we wouldn't feel the need to cheat.

25:58.375 --> 26:00.333
It wouldn't feel like a prison.

26:06.333 --> 26:09.833
Maybe marriage isn't to blame
for all setbacks in a relationship.

26:10.833 --> 26:15.666
What do you think? Maybe it's just easier
to put the blame on others.

26:21.416 --> 26:25.666
Especially if you are
no longer in love with your partner,

26:26.416 --> 26:28.500
and you lack the courage to say it.

26:34.250 --> 26:37.208
Life is too short
to be in a loveless relationship, Ryan.

27:23.958 --> 27:25.500
You smoke?

27:27.291 --> 27:30.208
Sometimes. When I drink. Actually, I quit.

27:34.208 --> 27:35.083
Sure.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.708
The bar should've been here. Look at this.

27:49.291 --> 27:52.416
Remember the Sunday Night Movies
during our childhood?

27:53.875 --> 27:55.791
There was this view of New York.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.166
Wow!

28:31.583 --> 28:33.375
You have a beautiful voice.

28:34.541 --> 28:35.416
Good job.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.083
If you'd like to join us on stage…

28:38.583 --> 28:41.208
-No, that's your thing. Thanks.
-Okay.

28:41.708 --> 28:42.583
No objections.

28:45.375 --> 28:47.750
I used to watch
those films on Sunday nights.

28:49.666 --> 28:54.708
Then it would be bedtime.
I'd go to bed and dream of New York.

28:54.791 --> 28:59.208
I'd say, "When I grow up, I'll go there."
This view felt so vibrant.

29:01.125 --> 29:06.125
I used to think the same for Istanbul.
"One day I'll go there, live there."

29:09.958 --> 29:12.500
The view of the Bosporus is way better.

29:13.750 --> 29:14.708
I love Istanbul.

29:15.416 --> 29:19.500
You can love both Istanbul and New York.
Give New York a shot.

29:19.583 --> 29:25.375
I did, but until now, all I've noticed is
this stench of piss in the streets.

29:25.458 --> 29:26.916
People seem lonely.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.041
-Smell of weed, and sad people.
-Come on.

29:58.208 --> 29:59.583
Let's go by bus.

29:59.666 --> 30:01.375
-By bus?
-Yes. Come on.

30:02.125 --> 30:02.958
Are you sure?

33:23.958 --> 33:27.000
-Wait. I'll be back. Stay there.
-Let's go. Please.

33:55.125 --> 33:56.208
Let's just go!

33:56.875 --> 33:59.500
Son of a bitch! Where is your knife now?

33:59.583 --> 34:01.125
Huh, pimp?

34:18.833 --> 34:22.166
-Don't let go of my hand again.
-And you don't either.

34:50.708 --> 34:52.333
I thought you didn't smoke.

34:56.666 --> 34:57.791
What? Is that mine?

34:58.958 --> 35:00.958
-It was in your pocket.
-My pocket?

35:04.875 --> 35:05.875
No way.

35:08.875 --> 35:12.250
Look at the tricks
you have up your sleeve, Ryan!

35:18.083 --> 35:19.250
What?

35:21.833 --> 35:25.291
Here we go.
Like all of that wasn't enough.

35:45.125 --> 35:47.875
You know you called the guy
"bird shit," right?

35:48.375 --> 35:49.250
"Bird shit?"

35:51.375 --> 35:54.166
Really? Did I call him "bird shit?"

36:05.375 --> 36:07.000
The girls were really hot.

36:09.208 --> 36:11.750
How come they thought I was competition?

36:12.958 --> 36:16.791
Well, they must have felt threatened
by your beauty.

36:20.875 --> 36:23.125
They must have been annoyed.

36:23.208 --> 36:25.458
Since they felt intimidated,

36:26.250 --> 36:29.083
it's no surprise
that they showed their teeth.

36:29.708 --> 36:30.541
Because…

36:31.208 --> 36:32.750
I mean, it makes sense.

36:34.041 --> 36:36.250
Wow! Such compliments!

36:37.500 --> 36:41.583
You started chattering, Ryan.
Is it the adrenaline, or this?

36:45.166 --> 36:46.250
I mean, both.

36:46.333 --> 36:47.500
Let's say both.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.041
Nicely balanced.

36:54.208 --> 36:55.041
So, now what?

36:56.625 --> 36:59.791
Shall we go back?
While we are still in one piece.

37:01.666 --> 37:03.875
-Let's go to the hotel.
-No.

37:04.375 --> 37:07.875
Not to the hotel.
I don't want to remember tonight this way.

37:09.333 --> 37:10.916
How do you want to remember it?

37:13.000 --> 37:14.416
Well, we're in New York.

37:15.416 --> 37:18.375
Two strangers meeting
for the first and last time.

37:19.500 --> 37:22.916
Let's do something different,
something we can't do in Istanbul.

37:38.541 --> 37:40.000
Hear me out now…

37:47.291 --> 37:48.541
Wasn't it great?

39:18.458 --> 39:20.083
-I can't believe you.
-Come.

39:35.583 --> 39:37.416
-I'll go to the restroom.
-Okay.

40:29.666 --> 40:30.833
This is ridiculous.

40:34.583 --> 40:35.416
A drink?

40:44.500 --> 40:47.291
-No way you're doing it.
-Then why are we here?

40:47.375 --> 40:50.416
-Let's leave. I thought we'd just watch.
-You will.

42:40.500 --> 42:41.625
You are really…

42:42.958 --> 42:44.000
I mean, really…

42:44.083 --> 42:46.750
-I just don't get it.
-Ryan, why the face?

42:46.833 --> 42:48.833
-No congratulating?
-It's nothing.

42:48.916 --> 42:52.541
So, you're faking it
with your husband too?

42:52.625 --> 42:55.125
Who said I was faking it?

42:56.458 --> 42:57.875
Come on. Night is young.

44:51.416 --> 44:53.583
I had so much fun. Thank you.

44:55.000 --> 44:55.833
Good night.

47:27.250 --> 47:28.083
Serin?

47:49.250 --> 47:51.291
Serin? What's wrong?

47:55.666 --> 47:56.666
The game is over.

48:23.333 --> 48:24.166
Serin.

48:25.333 --> 48:26.416
-Serin…
-Sir.

49:24.958 --> 49:26.541
EDA ARIKAN

49:35.333 --> 49:36.166
Eda, hi.

49:36.250 --> 49:38.875
Hi, Mehmet. Sorry if I mixed up the times.

49:38.958 --> 49:41.083
-Is it early?
-No, speak. What is it?

49:41.166 --> 49:44.500
I wanted to call you yesterday,
but you were busy.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.625
Anyway, I'm letting you know
the trial date is set.

49:49.291 --> 49:51.333
Next month, the 20th. At Çağlayan.

49:51.416 --> 49:52.833
At 11:30 a.m.

49:52.916 --> 49:54.625
I just called Mehmet too.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.708
It's uncontested, no need for witnesses.

49:58.791 --> 50:01.500
Only the two of you.
It'll take ten, 15 minutes.

50:01.583 --> 50:02.708
Okay, thanks.

50:58.666 --> 51:02.166
When I first saw him,
it felt like I'd already known him.

51:04.416 --> 51:08.375
You know that feeling of, "I'll have
a story with this guy"? That's how I felt.

51:16.041 --> 51:18.041
I froze when I saw her.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.625
Something inside me pulled me towards her.

51:22.958 --> 51:24.875
She even had a boyfriend then.

51:25.458 --> 51:28.333
I didn't care.
I asked her to come with me.

51:29.458 --> 51:34.000
I left my boyfriend and went with him.
I didn't think of anyone or anything.

51:34.500 --> 51:37.041
I didn't answer to anyone.
Including myself.

51:37.583 --> 51:40.708
I went to Mehmet's that night.
We never parted again.

51:44.208 --> 51:46.333
Sometimes I wonder where I'd be now,

51:46.416 --> 51:49.666
what my life would be like
if I hadn't said yes to him that day.

51:57.083 --> 51:58.375
Sometimes I wonder

52:00.166 --> 52:03.583
who I would have become
if she hadn't been in my life.

52:07.708 --> 52:09.333
I am very lucky

52:10.625 --> 52:12.041
to have had her.

52:15.375 --> 52:20.000
The third year of our relationship,
I got accepted to a college in New York.

52:20.083 --> 52:21.416
To study fashion design.

52:22.583 --> 52:24.375
I would have loved to go.

52:24.458 --> 52:26.791
But everything was perfect with Mehmet.

52:27.958 --> 52:28.833
She didn't go.

52:29.708 --> 52:30.875
We were in love.

52:31.833 --> 52:34.791
We couldn't let go of each other
even for a moment.

52:35.958 --> 52:38.416
Why would she go? How could I let her go?

52:43.458 --> 52:44.458
Then…

52:49.833 --> 52:51.666
My dad wants to meet you.

52:54.458 --> 52:55.875
-Your dad?
-Yes.

52:57.291 --> 52:59.166
I think you'll love each other.

53:01.041 --> 53:01.875
Look, son.

53:02.625 --> 53:05.125
She gave up her future for you.

53:05.791 --> 53:08.875
Her life would've been so different
if she'd gone to New York.

53:08.958 --> 53:10.416
She stayed for you.

53:12.208 --> 53:14.791
You need to get your life together.

53:15.333 --> 53:17.541
How long will you keep doing music?

53:18.750 --> 53:20.000
Get a real job.

53:20.541 --> 53:22.291
Be a man who is suitable for Serin.

53:23.250 --> 53:24.083
Okay?

53:27.250 --> 53:29.875
"Be a man who is suitable for Serin."

53:32.416 --> 53:33.333
Honestly…

53:35.041 --> 53:36.875
I felt like a piece of shit.

53:40.583 --> 53:42.333
How would you feel?

54:03.750 --> 54:08.416
We got married in a small ceremony abroad,
accompanied by our close friends.

54:09.458 --> 54:11.666
My parents learned about it later.

54:12.250 --> 54:14.791
We casually got married.

54:27.625 --> 54:28.916
Then I got a job.

54:30.083 --> 54:32.541
Wearing ties, jackets, suits…

54:33.708 --> 54:36.625
With that,
my music career went down the drain.

54:37.833 --> 54:41.500
I could only perform with my buddies
once in a blue moon.

54:42.416 --> 54:43.708
It wasn't the same.

54:44.375 --> 54:45.708
I found a job.

54:48.750 --> 54:51.083
Mehmet was a great support.
I'll give him that.

54:51.708 --> 54:53.041
He got a regular job.

54:53.125 --> 54:55.958
We started a new life.
We were happy and excited.

55:00.125 --> 55:01.666
Everything was magical.

55:01.750 --> 55:05.416
We were so into each other,
we wanted to do everything together.

55:05.500 --> 55:07.583
We made our life decisions

55:08.083 --> 55:09.875
thinking of each other.

55:09.958 --> 55:11.875
We shaped each other's lives.

55:12.875 --> 55:15.916
I guess that's why we're suffering now.

55:17.916 --> 55:20.916
We were both trying to build a career,

55:21.000 --> 55:22.958
but we never neglected each other.

55:24.250 --> 55:26.000
Initially, marriage was nice.

55:26.083 --> 55:29.833
We weren't like those couples
who lose the spark after marriage.

55:29.916 --> 55:33.291
-Don't touch here. Just the sides.
-Okay. I'll shave here.

55:33.375 --> 55:36.416
My mom used to
put me to sleep on my back, so…

55:40.458 --> 55:42.000
You did that on purpose.

55:42.833 --> 55:44.250
Shave it all, then.

55:45.791 --> 55:48.500
Then I started designing for a brand.

55:49.083 --> 55:51.291
More like I attempted to.

55:52.291 --> 55:54.708
She usually gets stressed while working.

55:54.791 --> 55:57.375
She has her own space,
own order of things.

55:57.458 --> 55:58.875
You must never touch it.

55:59.583 --> 56:00.583
Mehmet…

56:18.833 --> 56:19.750
What is this?

56:21.250 --> 56:23.250
I was just checking your website.

56:23.875 --> 56:27.500
I saw some models
that are almost the same as my designs.

56:27.583 --> 56:29.166
Are you aware of this?

56:29.250 --> 56:31.125
Why wasn't I informed?

56:32.208 --> 56:34.875
They are the same.
You just changed the color.

56:35.541 --> 56:38.416
They stole my ideas and fired me.

56:39.041 --> 56:42.000
You have no right to do this.
Where's my share for this?

56:42.708 --> 56:45.291
Fuck off, you fucking idiot!

56:56.083 --> 56:57.791
They are well aware. Great!

57:05.458 --> 57:08.458
That's when I first regretted
not going to New York.

57:15.750 --> 57:19.083
I sent some of my designs
to a place in New York.

57:19.166 --> 57:21.250
I just wanted to try my luck.

57:21.333 --> 57:23.666
I didn't have much hope, but then…

58:01.708 --> 58:05.583
DEAR SERİN YILMAZ, THANK YOU
FOR APPLYING TO VARGAND FASHION STUDIO

58:12.875 --> 58:14.708
She'd applied somewhere in New York.

58:14.791 --> 58:18.708
She was to prepare a collection.
If they liked it, they'd hire her.

58:19.500 --> 58:22.583
She hadn't told me that.
So, I didn't tell her I knew.

58:25.291 --> 58:26.125
I'm home.

58:28.208 --> 58:29.041
Welcome back.

58:40.291 --> 58:41.791
-How are you?
-Fine, dear.

58:46.416 --> 58:47.250
Wait. Sero.

58:51.750 --> 58:54.458
I waited for her to tell me. She didn't.

58:55.916 --> 58:57.833
I was afraid he would say no.

58:58.416 --> 59:01.625
Had he said no, I might not have gone.
He could've convinced me.

59:02.208 --> 59:03.458
My phone was ringing.

59:04.375 --> 59:06.750
We started arguing, fighting.

59:08.125 --> 59:11.000
She challenged everything I said,
acted stubborn,

59:11.500 --> 59:13.416
disagreed with me on everything.

59:28.625 --> 59:29.541
Serin!

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.833
Whenever I went to a photo shoot for work,
he'd get jealous, and we'd argue.

01:00:09.666 --> 01:00:11.166
-Yes?
-Where are you?

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:13.000
At a shoot.

01:00:13.083 --> 01:00:14.458
Still at the shoot?

01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:17.750
I got held up. We're doing my collection.
It's turning out great.

01:00:17.833 --> 01:00:20.666
My instrument.
I'm home, and I can't believe it.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:25.208
I've told you so many times
not to put anything on my instrument.

01:00:25.291 --> 01:00:27.791
I'm very sensitive about this.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.791
You act like you don't know
how sensitive--

01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:33.833
-I'm doing a shoot. Let's talk at home.
-What is this?

01:00:37.125 --> 01:00:38.333
-Unbelievable!
-What?

01:00:38.416 --> 01:00:39.375
Serin?

01:00:43.375 --> 01:00:44.875
-İyi?
-İyi. Yeah.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.041
-Honey, I have to go.
-Who's there?

01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:51.125
-The crew.
-Is it a movie set? What's taking long?

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:56.416
Calm down. Let me finish the shoot.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.750
-We'll talk when I come home.
-Or don't come.

01:00:58.833 --> 01:01:01.708
-You treat this place like a hotel.
-I'm hanging up.

01:01:21.208 --> 01:01:22.500
Look who's here.

01:01:27.458 --> 01:01:29.958
-Please don't do it again.
-What? Am I a sitter?

01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:33.333
-Don't disturb me while I'm working.
-Am I a house sitter?

01:01:33.833 --> 01:01:36.708
What am I at this house? What am I to you?

01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:38.750
What time is it? Who was that?

01:01:38.833 --> 01:01:40.666
What do you want?

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.500
-I worked all day. What do you want?
-What did you drink?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.416
-Wait.
-What did I drink?

01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:50.541
-What do you mean, "Or don't come?"
-Who is that guy?

01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:52.583
What were you doing at this hour?

01:01:55.833 --> 01:01:58.166
I heard him laughing in the background.

01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:01.250
-What should he do? Pick a fight like you?
-How fun--

01:02:03.916 --> 01:02:05.833
Do happy people piss you off?

01:02:05.916 --> 01:02:10.250
You were having fun, so why did you come?
Look at the time. This is a home!

01:02:10.958 --> 01:02:12.000
Who am I to you?

01:02:12.083 --> 01:02:14.500
-Fun is irrelevant. This is my home.
-Just--

01:02:18.791 --> 01:02:19.666
Mehmet…

01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:22.750
Mehmet.

01:02:36.041 --> 01:02:38.250
CANSU - NEW MESSAGE

01:02:38.333 --> 01:02:40.500
HI, I'M BACK
SO, HOW ARE YOU?

01:02:40.583 --> 01:02:41.958
GREAT TO TALK TO YOU

01:02:46.208 --> 01:02:48.958
MEHMET, DO YOU HAVE TIME?
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU

01:02:49.041 --> 01:02:50.916
I WISH YOU WERE THERE YESTERDAY

01:02:52.958 --> 01:02:55.583
PARTY ON FRIDAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN?

01:02:55.666 --> 01:02:58.916
DO YOU THINK THIS DRESS IS GOOD
FOR A WORK MEAL?

01:03:00.458 --> 01:03:01.291
Whoa.

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:23.958
Yes, I'm listening.

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:27.541
I don't want to be accused like this.

01:03:27.625 --> 01:03:30.000
A month and a half ago,
we performed in Kadıköy.

01:03:31.458 --> 01:03:32.666
Yes, in Kadıköy.

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:33.916
You were there too.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.291
You left early.

01:03:35.375 --> 01:03:38.208
If you'd stayed,
you would have met this girl.

01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:41.416
That's all. She came that day,
we ran into each other.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.833
Hadn't seen her for years.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:48.625
Yes. And if I was up to some shit,
I would lock it with a passcode, okay?

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:52.583
There is no secret
where there is no passcode.

01:03:52.666 --> 01:03:55.375
-Check it any time.
-Yeah, you don't even care.

01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:57.958
Honey, should I call the girl? You--

01:03:58.041 --> 01:04:00.250
-So laid-back.
-What? I didn't do anything.

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:03.458
What happened after the gig?
Why is she sending you photos?

01:04:03.541 --> 01:04:06.583
-Want me to be honest?
-What happened after the gig?

01:04:06.666 --> 01:04:08.583
Nothing. What do you think?

01:04:08.666 --> 01:04:10.958
She came, listened, and left.

01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:12.291
-We were--
-Come on!

01:04:12.375 --> 01:04:15.916
-We just talked over the phone. Look--
-What happened after the gig?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.333
-Nothing. I finished my drink.
-She texts you every morning!

01:04:19.416 --> 01:04:22.541
-I dropped her home. She was drunk.
-Dropped her home?

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:24.250
-Yes.
-Good job.

01:04:24.333 --> 01:04:26.458
-This is--
-And? How did you drop her?

01:04:27.125 --> 01:04:28.291
Are you kidding?

01:04:28.375 --> 01:04:31.125
Did I write anything bad in here?

01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:34.041
-Any sign of flirting?
-What did you do after?

01:04:34.125 --> 01:04:37.375
Am I the reason why she sends me
photos of her cleavage?

01:04:37.458 --> 01:04:38.416
Might be into me.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.583
Why has she been sending photos
every morning for a month?

01:04:41.666 --> 01:04:45.250
Are you her stylist? "Good for work?"
Always with three emojis!

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:48.583
-Her--
-She was drunk, and you had a threesome?

01:04:48.666 --> 01:04:50.666
No! I'll be honest with you.

01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:52.791
-There was no sex!
-Honesty? It's over!

01:04:52.875 --> 01:04:58.333
You showed no interest in me.
Everyone deserves occasional affection.

01:04:59.833 --> 01:05:01.583
And it feels nice receiving it.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.250
Why did you take off your ring?

01:05:48.958 --> 01:05:51.333
Mehmet, I've thought about it a lot.

01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:54.666
There's no longer true love between us.

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:56.708
We're not good for each other.

01:05:56.791 --> 01:06:00.791
We're drifting away
in a passionless and dull life.

01:06:00.875 --> 01:06:02.500
It's hard to admit it,

01:06:03.208 --> 01:06:04.458
but that's how it is.

01:06:05.375 --> 01:06:09.083
For you to even think about
texting this woman proves my point.

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:11.250
We can't go on like this.

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:12.750
We shouldn't.

01:06:13.791 --> 01:06:14.916
I mean, I can't.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I'm really sorry.

01:06:16.791 --> 01:06:18.375
I'm writing this letter

01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:21.083
because if we try to talk,
we'll fight again.

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:23.958
We won't listen to or hear each other.

01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:26.958
Defenses, accusations…
I don't have the strength for that.

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:31.541
I don't have the strength
for an unhappy marriage.

01:06:31.625 --> 01:06:32.750
Let's get a divorce.

01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:37.166
That's it. It's that simple for her.

01:06:38.208 --> 01:06:40.000
Just because I texted someone.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000
If Serin texted
with someone from her past,

01:06:46.666 --> 01:06:48.333
how would you feel?

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:06.208
If Mehmet applied for a job abroad
without telling you,

01:07:06.875 --> 01:07:08.291
how would you feel?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.625
I'll ask you something now.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:28.750
Please think carefully before you answer.

01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:35.500
If you met each other today,
would you still fall for each other?

01:07:40.666 --> 01:07:45.166
We are not who we used to be.
Maybe we wouldn't like each other at all.

01:07:46.583 --> 01:07:47.541
Yeah. Who knows?

01:07:49.708 --> 01:07:51.375
Does it matter now anyway?

01:07:51.875 --> 01:07:54.666
We filed for divorce.
We're waiting for a trial date.

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:56.666
This is our last session too.

01:07:59.083 --> 01:07:59.916
Fine.

01:08:02.833 --> 01:08:07.375
Then in this last session,
I'll have one last suggestion for you.

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:09.333
Why would I take your passport?

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:11.083
Hello.

01:08:12.541 --> 01:08:13.375
To the airport.

01:08:17.625 --> 01:08:21.750
When is your job interview in New York?

01:08:21.833 --> 01:08:23.166
Next month.

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:24.625
Perfect.

01:08:25.125 --> 01:08:27.750
Can you go there together, by any chance?

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:34.916
I want you to act like
you've just met each other

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.416
for the very first time.

01:08:37.208 --> 01:08:38.916
I just want to help you.

01:08:39.625 --> 01:08:40.750
Let's go, shall we?

01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:42.208
Please.

01:09:02.791 --> 01:09:05.875
-It will be a huge mistake.
-What do you mean, a huge mistake?

01:09:05.958 --> 01:09:09.541
-Don't let go of my hand again.
-And you don't either.

01:09:12.458 --> 01:09:14.666
I still love you very much, you know.

01:09:15.958 --> 01:09:17.208
I really miss us.

01:09:18.541 --> 01:09:20.708
Me too. Let's just enjoy it.

01:09:52.666 --> 01:09:53.791
Green water.

01:09:53.875 --> 01:09:55.041
With ginger.

01:09:56.541 --> 01:09:58.125
It can cure your hangover.

01:09:58.666 --> 01:10:00.833
-You like this stuff.
-Thank you.

01:10:01.375 --> 01:10:04.625
The alcohol and cigarettes killed me.
Got your suitcase?

01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:06.000
Yes.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.375
-Anything missing?
-No.

01:10:08.875 --> 01:10:09.708
Cool.

01:10:18.416 --> 01:10:19.250
You like it?

01:10:45.791 --> 01:10:47.958
Turns out, the therapist was right.

01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:54.666
Yesterday was good for us.

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:56.541
Yes, I agree.

01:10:59.458 --> 01:11:00.333
We laughed.

01:11:02.833 --> 01:11:04.708
We were cheerful, like we used to be.

01:11:05.583 --> 01:11:09.458
And we talked.
We hadn't talked this much for so long.

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.708
And we didn't fight.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.291
Not with each other, yes.

01:11:17.666 --> 01:11:19.625
-Yeah.
-Does your hand hurt?

01:11:20.458 --> 01:11:21.500
No, it's fine.

01:11:22.875 --> 01:11:25.083
Yesterday, I saw
the old Mehmet in your eyes.

01:11:26.875 --> 01:11:28.208
The Mehmet that wants me.

01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:35.833
Do you recall what she said?

01:11:39.583 --> 01:11:43.416
"If you met each other today,
would you still fall for each other?"

01:11:44.875 --> 01:11:45.708
I would.

01:11:50.291 --> 01:11:53.416
Yeah, I'd fall deeply
for the guy I met yesterday.

01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:01.458
But we didn't meet yesterday.

01:12:07.666 --> 01:12:11.250
-What do you mean?
-I mean, nothing has changed.

01:12:12.208 --> 01:12:15.125
The stuff that brought us here
didn't vanish overnight.

01:12:18.708 --> 01:12:22.125
Last night was one of
the most memorable nights of my life.

01:12:23.125 --> 01:12:26.750
I'm sure that once we're back in Istanbul,
we'll start fighting again.

01:12:26.833 --> 01:12:29.083
We'll ruin each other's lives again.

01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:33.791
I don't want to be that woman.
Grumpy, always yelling.

01:12:34.375 --> 01:12:36.208
I don't like that version of myself.

01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:41.000
Trying to be myself
and us at the same time…

01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:59.416
-I can't give you what you want.
-What did I ask from you?

01:13:00.041 --> 01:13:03.750
-What have I ever wanted from you?
-You said it last night.

01:13:03.833 --> 01:13:05.708
-I don't want a baby.
-Okay.

01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:09.541
-I can't.
-I don't want to live here. I never will.

01:13:10.041 --> 01:13:12.541
Yeah, that's why
we'll set each other free.

01:13:12.625 --> 01:13:14.625
-Is there any other way?
-Thousands.

01:13:15.125 --> 01:13:18.791
I told you yesterday.
What matters is choosing to be together.

01:13:18.875 --> 01:13:22.583
But instead, you're throwing us away
by preferring to live here.

01:13:22.666 --> 01:13:24.791
-Such a shame.
-I'm throwing us away?

01:13:24.875 --> 01:13:26.583
It's all my fault, yeah.

01:13:26.666 --> 01:13:29.125
You want a divorce, I don't.

01:13:29.208 --> 01:13:32.416
-I mean, I didn't.
-You could've supported me.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:36.833
Instead of saying, "I'm here for you,"
you say "Don't. It'll be a shame."

01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:43.416
This is the thing.
When it's about your work, life stops.

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.791
When it's about
what I've dreamed about my whole life,

01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:47.958
I'm selfish.

01:13:48.041 --> 01:13:49.000
My work?

01:13:50.166 --> 01:13:52.500
I gave up myself altogether!

01:13:53.458 --> 01:13:55.666
I'm busting my ass to make you happy!

01:13:56.916 --> 01:13:59.000
And you're planning to move abroad!

01:13:59.083 --> 01:14:02.375
Apparently, that justifies
you cheating on me.

01:14:04.583 --> 01:14:05.750
I didn't cheat.

01:14:06.333 --> 01:14:08.166
You're only fooling yourself.

01:14:08.666 --> 01:14:11.791
We know what would've happened
if I hadn't seen those messages.

01:14:11.875 --> 01:14:15.375
Serin, I did not cheat on you.

01:14:15.458 --> 01:14:17.625
Cheating is not my thing.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.666
Remember, it was you who came to me
when you had a boyfriend.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.000
Get out!

01:14:26.041 --> 01:14:26.875
Will you leave?

01:14:45.625 --> 01:14:47.250
We're getting divorced.

01:14:49.666 --> 01:14:51.875
The date is set, do you realize that?

01:14:51.958 --> 01:14:53.458
It's not child's play.

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.458
-I'll be late to my interview.
-Your interview.

01:14:58.541 --> 01:15:01.375
Your job is more important.
So is this fucking city!

01:15:01.458 --> 01:15:03.791
Everything is more important than me!

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.208
And you say you love me.
I mean, you said so yesterday.

01:15:09.041 --> 01:15:12.750
Yes, I love you,
but I don't want this. Don't you get it?

01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:27.583
Fine.

01:15:31.666 --> 01:15:34.250
I don't want to be with someone
who doesn't want me.

01:19:30.083 --> 01:19:33.583
Serin, this is the first time
I'm writing a letter.

01:19:34.083 --> 01:19:36.791
I don't know if I'll do well,
but I'll try.

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:39.500
You may have a point.

01:19:39.583 --> 01:19:43.208
Maybe I'll explain myself better
than by talking face-to-face.

01:19:43.708 --> 01:19:45.375
You were right.

01:19:45.458 --> 01:19:49.916
Maybe I couldn't be
as good a man as you wanted or deserved.

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:53.666
If I couldn't make you feel
that I support you

01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:56.375
in everything you want to do
or you dream of,

01:19:57.166 --> 01:19:58.000
I'm sorry.

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:02.250
I'm really sorry

01:20:02.333 --> 01:20:06.208
if I made you feel like
I no longer love you or get you

01:20:06.291 --> 01:20:07.708
even just for a day.

01:20:09.833 --> 01:20:14.958
I'm so scared of losing you,
that I'm actually losing you.

01:20:15.916 --> 01:20:19.708
Yes, we both had dreams when we first met,

01:20:19.791 --> 01:20:23.375
and in time,
we had to give up some of them.

01:20:23.458 --> 01:20:27.000
Could we have done better than
blaming each other for it?

01:20:27.083 --> 01:20:27.916
I don't know.

01:20:30.958 --> 01:20:32.541
But one thing I do know is

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:37.041
that the couples who grow old together,
fight too.

01:20:40.083 --> 01:20:43.125
They also get tired and bored,

01:20:43.208 --> 01:20:45.208
and want to give up sometimes.

01:20:46.958 --> 01:20:48.916
There's only one reason they don't.

01:20:49.583 --> 01:20:53.166
Their faith in finding one another
in that home of theirs

01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:56.375
after everything and everyone is gone.

01:20:58.875 --> 01:21:00.125
What I call "home,"

01:21:00.208 --> 01:21:04.750
and you call "love" or "passion," is
actually that faith, don't you think?

01:21:05.666 --> 01:21:07.541
I wanted us to have that faith.

01:21:08.041 --> 01:21:09.166
I wanted it a lot.

01:21:09.875 --> 01:21:13.291
I wish it was us against the world,
shouting "We are one!"

01:21:15.458 --> 01:21:17.791
I really wish we didn't give up.

01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:19.500
Because I…

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.958
I'm still madly in love with you.

01:21:23.333 --> 01:21:24.916
You still have a return ticket.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.125
If you change your mind,
I'll be on that Istanbul flight.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.083
I don't want to settle in another country
behind your back.

01:23:45.166 --> 01:23:46.583
I get your anger. Sorry.

01:23:49.416 --> 01:23:50.583
Got the job?

01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:53.625
I won't accept it.

01:23:54.875 --> 01:23:56.375
Can we not get divorced?

01:24:35.916 --> 01:24:36.750
Come here.

01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:14.958
Unbelievable! Is this a joke?
