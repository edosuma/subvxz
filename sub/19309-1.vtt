00:22.608 --> 00:24.843
[ music ]

01:26.004 --> 01:28.874
Come on, Anton, I'll
race you. Get up!

02:07.279 --> 02:11.283
- Look, they're coming.
-Let's go and tell everyone.

02:17.222 --> 02:21.560
- Connie, I won.
- I knew you would.

02:24.529 --> 02:29.067
- you'll never beat
me, as usual. - What
was the bet this time?

02:29.067 --> 02:33.939
The honor of having
the first dance with
the new Lady Chatterley.

02:57.362 --> 02:59.364
This one's pretty enough...

02:59.364 --> 03:02.868
...but I understand she's
the daughter of an artist.

03:02.968 --> 03:06.838
She's just what Clifford
and this old house needs.

03:06.838 --> 03:11.543
She's alive in the way
the others never could be.

03:24.322 --> 03:29.060
- Necessity knows no law, my
friends. -Politics, politics.

03:29.394 --> 03:35.200
- How to ruin a party:
Invite a German. -Anton,
we're not enemies yet.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.638
- But the situation is serious.
-Please, not this evening.

03:39.638 --> 03:44.643
- Why don't you dance with my
wife? -With pleasure. Excuse me.

04:30.655 --> 04:34.993
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?

04:35.961 --> 04:42.334
I'm sorry to interrupt the
dance, but I'm sure you'll
want to hear the news.

04:42.367 --> 04:47.005
For the last 24 minutes, England
has been at war with Germany.

04:50.942 --> 04:53.612
Let us drink to England.

04:57.349 --> 04:59.417
England.

05:01.386 --> 05:03.622
- England. -England.

05:03.922 --> 05:08.660
- And to Germany, of
course. -To Germany.

05:08.994 --> 05:11.129
- And to England. -Germany.

05:13.632 --> 05:16.268
Goodbye, Auntie.
Look after Connie.

05:16.301 --> 05:19.170
- I shan't be long.
-Goodbye, Hilda.

05:19.471 --> 05:21.706
Goodbye. Goodbye.

05:24.910 --> 05:29.814
- Darling, I'd rather you
didn't come. -Are you sure?

05:41.359 --> 05:45.130
- Cliff, take care of
yourself. -Roberts.

05:48.266 --> 05:51.937
Should be back just in time
for the pheasant season.

05:59.311 --> 06:01.780
Come on, lads!

06:04.516 --> 06:07.385
Go on! Forwards!

06:07.552 --> 06:12.557
Faster! Go on, faster!

06:14.059 --> 06:16.127
Keep the line! Keep the line!

06:16.461 --> 06:19.764
Forwards! Forwards, forwards!

06:19.764 --> 06:22.067
Go on, lads!

06:23.001 --> 06:25.070
Forwards!

06:38.316 --> 06:41.152
This one's still
breathing, Paddy.

08:24.856 --> 08:30.562
"'you can take a seat, Mr.
Worthing.' She looks in
her pocket for a pencil.

08:30.995 --> 08:34.199
'Thank you, Lady Bracknell,
I prefer standing.'

08:34.432 --> 08:36.968
Lady Bracknell,
notebook in hand:

08:37.202 --> 08:41.406
'I feel bound to tell you that
you are not down on my list
of eligible young men...

08:41.406 --> 08:47.278
...but it's the same list
the Duchess of Bolton
has. We work together.

08:48.012 --> 08:51.983
However, I will enter your
name should your answers be...

08:51.983 --> 08:54.853
...what a really affectionate
mother requires.

08:55.253 --> 08:59.958
Do you smoke?' 'yes, I
must admit, I smoke.'

09:00.325 --> 09:02.594
'I am glad to hear it."'

09:02.861 --> 09:07.132
10:30. It's time to
go to bed, darling.

09:15.073 --> 09:18.076
Dear, dear, another day gone.

09:38.663 --> 09:41.633
Thank you, darling,
I can manage.

10:19.237 --> 10:21.706
Good night, Connie.

10:44.229 --> 10:46.197
Good morning.

10:52.570 --> 10:58.610
Fritchley Hall, the home
of Lord and Lady Stewart is
offered for sale in September.

10:58.610 --> 11:03.982
It's rumoured that
Shipley, near Matlock,
may suffer the same fate.

11:05.283 --> 11:08.753
It's as if the whole world
is collapsing around us.

11:08.953 --> 11:10.421
What's that, darling?

11:10.855 --> 11:14.959
They want to sell
Fritchley Hall and Shipley.
- Oh yes. No.

11:15.560 --> 11:18.763
I suppose the one thing
pushes out the other.

11:19.130 --> 11:22.367
But what about us?
Here? This house?

11:23.001 --> 11:26.638
Everything changes
except change itself.

12:08.079 --> 12:11.249
I fancy a cigar is called for.

12:11.582 --> 12:14.786
I can manage. Thank you, Field.

12:17.555 --> 12:21.492
- That will be all for this
evening. -Very good, sir.

12:25.063 --> 12:28.566
I think you're
wonderful, I do, really.

12:28.866 --> 12:32.904
- Why? -The way you
are with Clifford.

12:32.904 --> 12:37.375
I think it's wonderful,
really. Poor boy...

12:37.608 --> 12:41.312
...so crippled as he is.

12:42.814 --> 12:46.784
Not more than half a
man, you might say.

12:47.085 --> 12:50.555
It's the right half
for a woman like me.

12:50.555 --> 12:53.124
He can be so witty
and entertaining.

12:53.124 --> 12:59.964
But for a young wife,
I'm not so sure at all.

13:01.432 --> 13:06.537
- Care for one of mine? -Thank
you, I have one of my own.

13:07.505 --> 13:10.341
I was very young when
I married Richard.

13:10.341 --> 13:15.179
We wanted reform, politics,
all that sort of thing.

13:15.179 --> 13:20.084
And we got it. But ever since
he died, despite the children...

13:20.084 --> 13:24.789
...I feel I've lived
for nothing. It's a
dreadful feeling.

13:24.789 --> 13:30.027
To know you're bound to
die without having the
things you were born for.

13:30.528 --> 13:35.533
Die? Who's going to die?

13:36.067 --> 13:39.837
I've been there and
back. Immortality.

13:40.338 --> 13:46.611
What are we born for? It
seems to me that we are
born for so many things.

13:47.078 --> 13:50.748
Or perhaps we're not
born for anything at all.

13:50.982 --> 13:55.186
It's just a matter of
making up our minds.

13:55.553 --> 13:58.556
- Immortality. -Immortality.

13:58.956 --> 14:03.528
I think women should
experiment more.

14:03.761 --> 14:06.631
Get what you want in your youth.

14:06.864 --> 14:10.001
Nothing is so bad for a
woman getting on in years...

14:10.001 --> 14:13.704
...than the thought
that she's missed.

14:13.971 --> 14:16.207
Good night, dear.

14:16.674 --> 14:21.179
I'm leaving early
in the morning, so I
shan't see you again.

14:22.346 --> 14:25.650
There's nothing so
sad or futile...

14:25.650 --> 14:31.355
...as an elderly woman
possessed by vain regrets.

15:34.218 --> 15:37.088
I am possessed.

15:50.334 --> 15:53.838
Connie, I need to talk to you.

15:54.171 --> 15:56.707
Sit down a moment.

16:00.745 --> 16:04.582
you know, you're the
worst loser, in a sense.

16:04.582 --> 16:08.786
- Darling. - I depend
on you, live on you.

16:08.786 --> 16:11.656
But you're denied a
serious part of life.

16:11.822 --> 16:17.361
The fact you are denied,
it may work inside your
subconscious, harming you.

16:17.728 --> 16:21.566
But you know I need you
as much as you need me.

16:22.300 --> 16:27.204
- you did want me before,
didn't you? -Of course.

16:27.705 --> 16:30.508
I know, and it's bitter.

16:30.942 --> 16:34.912
you see, I don't want
you to feel you've
brought me a sacrifice.

16:36.247 --> 16:40.184
Connie, I must tell you this.
If ever there's a man...

16:40.451 --> 16:45.122
...who you absolutely want
to make love to you...

16:46.190 --> 16:51.429
...take him. Have a
lover if you want to.

16:53.230 --> 16:57.168
Look, a kestrel.

17:00.805 --> 17:04.241
Don't ever forget I love you.

17:08.546 --> 17:12.183
- Hey, come on here.
-Come here, girl.

17:12.316 --> 17:14.752
Come on up. Come on up.

17:17.221 --> 17:22.159
- I'm sorry about the dog, sir.
-Don't worry, she's a good girl.

17:22.493 --> 17:26.530
Look, will you give me a
push back to the house?
- Yes, sir.

17:32.403 --> 17:34.472
- Milady. -Hello.

17:34.672 --> 17:36.974
All right, pull.

18:00.264 --> 18:02.133
Thank you, Mellors.

18:19.083 --> 18:20.918
Thank you, Field.

18:23.454 --> 18:24.922
Clifford?

18:26.390 --> 18:28.526
Do you need some help?

18:30.227 --> 18:34.031
- No, nearly done now.
-How did we do last year?

18:36.067 --> 18:40.971
Not bad, considering. Even
the pheasants sold quite well.

18:41.338 --> 18:45.109
What about the mine?
Shouldn't you open it again?

18:45.109 --> 18:48.112
- I heard that coal--
-Not the right time.

18:48.546 --> 18:50.948
Not the right time at all.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.795
Connie.

19:08.632 --> 19:13.471
It's all right,
darling. Don't worry.

19:33.624 --> 19:36.761
I'm sick and tired of
these records, darling.

19:37.561 --> 19:41.799
- Could you play me something
like you used to?
-What would you like me to play?

19:42.266 --> 19:46.971
Whatever you like. you know the
one. The one you play so well.

19:46.971 --> 19:48.439
All right, then.

20:19.537 --> 20:21.138
Clifford!

20:21.972 --> 20:23.674
Oh, Clifford...

20:24.742 --> 20:26.844
Call for Dr. Christie.

20:33.751 --> 20:35.653
The doctor's on his way.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.662
They're here, milady.

20:45.196 --> 20:47.865
But it's not the
doctor, it's a nurse.

20:56.907 --> 21:00.544
I'm Mrs. Bolton. I came
as quickly as I could.

21:00.544 --> 21:03.814
- Good lord Lady Chatterley,
you look ill too.
- No, I'm fine.

21:03.814 --> 21:08.953
Far from fine. I'll take
a look at him first, then
I'll take a look at you.

21:09.954 --> 21:12.456
I'm fine. I'm fine.

21:14.291 --> 21:17.161
Good afternoon, Sir Clifford.
- Mrs. Bolton.

21:17.161 --> 21:19.730
I'm perfectly all right.
I've told everyone that.

21:19.730 --> 21:24.568
I'll decide, if you don't mind.
What seems to be the trouble?

21:24.568 --> 21:28.239
Nothing new, just the
same old nonsense.

21:28.772 --> 21:33.677
It's my shoulders this time, and
what's left of my damned spine.

21:34.612 --> 21:40.985
- This weather is a godsend.
-Providing we don't get a flood
the way we did in '15.

21:41.018 --> 21:44.088
We won't. It'll clear up
before the weeks out.

21:44.088 --> 21:46.423
Isn't there anything I can do?

21:47.057 --> 21:50.561
- Show me, in case it
happens again. -We'll see.

21:50.561 --> 21:56.934
You can do something, Con.
Go and find out where Mellors is
setting eggs under the birds.

21:56.967 --> 22:00.471
We did well last year. I
want to do even better
this year.

22:00.471 --> 22:03.040
Clifford, that's
not important now.

22:03.340 --> 22:06.844
Fresh air and
healthy activity...

22:06.844 --> 22:10.781
...that's my prescription
for you, milady.

24:34.658 --> 24:37.061
Pain is nothing to be afraid of.

24:37.061 --> 24:41.498
It's just the body's
way of telling us that
something's amiss.

24:43.333 --> 24:45.903
Right, on your back.

24:47.538 --> 24:51.175
Connie, you're back early.
What did Mellors say?

24:51.175 --> 24:52.876
I couldn't find him.

24:52.876 --> 24:56.880
Connie, I can't ask you
to do the simplest thing.

24:58.482 --> 25:00.818
That's for you, milady.

25:01.085 --> 25:04.488
- What is it? -Just
some quinine and herbs.

25:04.488 --> 25:07.658
Hope it's not a love potion.

25:08.125 --> 25:12.729
By the way, Mrs. Bolton is
spending the night. Could you
organize the blue room for her?

25:13.030 --> 25:16.200
- Of course. -Drink up.

25:20.270 --> 25:26.076
you've had a tiring
day, Sir Clifford. you
must get some rest.

25:26.076 --> 25:30.547
- Thank you Mrs. Bolton.
I'll look after my husband.
-Certainly, milady.

25:30.547 --> 25:34.885
- Good night, Sir
Clifford and milady. -Good
night, and thank you.

25:36.854 --> 25:41.291
- Now, what's so funny? -The
Adventures of Hajji Baba.

25:41.558 --> 25:44.995
He's repelled by the naked
faces of English women.

25:45.963 --> 25:47.998
If only they'd
covered their faces...

25:47.998 --> 25:51.468
...what fire of passion
would have run through his body.

25:52.569 --> 25:54.404
That's amusing.

25:55.539 --> 25:59.810
Perhaps it's a pity we never
see anything of
people but their face.

25:59.810 --> 26:05.115
After all, the worst part of
most people is their face.

26:05.115 --> 26:09.486
you mean if we covered our
faces and walked about naked?

26:09.486 --> 26:12.789
Like Renoir. Why not?

26:16.593 --> 26:21.031
And a torso in sculpture is
often so lovely without a head.

26:21.899 --> 26:26.003
- It has a life of
its own. -Perhaps.

26:27.738 --> 26:30.941
Sorry if I was unpleasant
this afternoon.

29:21.511 --> 29:23.547
Good morning, milady.

29:23.714 --> 29:26.817
And the bishop
moves this way, yes?

29:26.817 --> 29:31.722
- That's right, and
the knight moves-- -One
ahead and two diagonally.

29:32.122 --> 29:36.293
you look beautiful. What
are you gonna do today?

29:36.626 --> 29:38.695
Nothing in particular.

29:39.062 --> 29:42.632
If you've nothing better
to do, why not try again?

29:42.866 --> 29:46.970
- Try what? -Find out
about the pheasant's eggs.

29:47.404 --> 29:50.507
- If you want me to.
-Thank you, darling.

29:50.841 --> 29:52.142
There.

29:53.143 --> 29:57.581
- you're very quick.
-That I am, sir.

30:29.513 --> 30:31.681
Excuse me, ma'am.

30:40.791 --> 30:43.126
Quiet. Hey.

30:47.364 --> 30:48.999
Lie down.

30:56.673 --> 30:59.409
- Hello. -Hello.

31:00.043 --> 31:05.148
- What can I do for you?
- Sir Clifford wants to know
when will you set the eggs?

31:05.148 --> 31:09.986
Already started. It's
under control. Be better
than last year, tell him.

31:21.665 --> 31:23.633
- May I? - If you'd like.

31:44.721 --> 31:47.824
- It's very pleasant
here. -you think so?

31:48.225 --> 31:53.930
yes. I shall come here and see
the birds, watch them grow.

31:53.964 --> 31:55.799
Will you, now?

31:57.400 --> 32:00.070
Are there two keys to the hut?

32:03.273 --> 32:07.310
- Do you hear me?
-There's only one key.

32:07.310 --> 32:10.514
- Couldn't you have one
made? -Aye, we could.

32:12.315 --> 32:16.253
Only, why doesn't Sir
Clifford build a little
summerhouse for you?

32:17.220 --> 32:19.856
No, I want to come here and
watch the pheasants hatch.

32:20.223 --> 32:23.860
I have to be on me own, now
that the birds are laying
19 to dozen.

32:23.860 --> 32:28.932
- I shan't interfere. -So, have
you thought birds don't like
strangers around.

32:28.932 --> 32:35.739
-I want a key. When can I have
it? -How many bosses am I to
have round here nowadays anyway?

32:35.739 --> 32:40.810
Then don't make a key. On second
thought, I don't believe I ever
want to be here again.

32:48.552 --> 32:53.290
Clifford? I gave Mellors
your message. What's this?

32:53.290 --> 32:57.627
I've decided to try my hand
again, thinking of Renoir.

32:57.861 --> 33:02.499
- What a good idea. -Of
course, I was never very good.

33:02.799 --> 33:06.002
I wonder what I'll see now,
after all that's happened.

33:06.202 --> 33:10.407
- Well, there's always me.
-If I start on portraits
you'll have to join the queue.

33:10.407 --> 33:13.777
- Mrs. B's already
asked. -How can she?

33:13.777 --> 33:17.514
- She's gonna stay a while.
-Nothing serious, is it?

33:17.514 --> 33:21.585
No, she just thought if she was
here it would free you more.

33:21.585 --> 33:25.221
She'll give me my exercises.
She may as well be on the spot.

33:25.221 --> 33:28.792
- It's marvelous,
isn't it? -Marvelous.

33:31.294 --> 33:34.831
Mrs. Bolton you'll be staying
with us a while. That's good.

33:34.831 --> 33:38.969
I think it's for the best. Did
you find Mr. Mellors today?

33:39.336 --> 33:43.807
I did. He's the most insolent
man I've ever talked to.

33:43.807 --> 33:47.510
He was a defiant little
demon, even when he was a lad.

33:47.911 --> 33:52.949
- You know him, then? -As much
as anyone who knows anyone who
prefers to keep his own company.

33:53.783 --> 33:57.320
I used to think he had a heart,
if anybody could get there.

33:57.587 --> 34:01.324
- A heart. -With most women he
just gets their backs up.

34:01.324 --> 34:02.726
Like he has with you.

34:02.859 --> 34:03.893
- Club. -Ace.

34:03.893 --> 34:07.430
That's a cheat. You can't do
that. You're cheating Mrs. B.
Take a card. Thank you.

34:07.831 --> 34:11.735
No that's you. Alright, my go.
My go. Jack.

34:13.870 --> 34:18.475
- Card change. - I'm
tired. I think I'll go up.

34:18.875 --> 34:20.944
- Good night Mrs. Bolton.
-Good night milady.

34:20.944 --> 34:23.480
- Good night,
darling. -Good night.

34:26.716 --> 34:29.653
- Ten. -Ten.

34:31.421 --> 34:34.591
- Eight and change.
-Change of suit?

34:34.891 --> 34:36.493
- Yes, change of suit.
- What do you want?

34:36.493 --> 34:39.462
- Clubs. -Clubs.

34:46.036 --> 34:50.373
Clifford, I have a problem.
you said I should take a lover.

34:50.373 --> 34:56.780
- Want me to choose for
you, do you? -No, but
what if I have a child?

34:56.813 --> 34:59.616
Would you mind if I had a child?

34:59.949 --> 35:03.453
- If you had whose
child? - I don't know.
Would you mind?

35:03.453 --> 35:06.589
Couldn't you promise it'd
be by the Holy Ghost?

35:06.956 --> 35:09.726
- Would you mind? -Whose child?

35:10.360 --> 35:11.995
But need you ask?

35:12.228 --> 35:15.699
Isn't it the Holy Ghost if
one looks at it that way?

35:16.633 --> 35:20.970
All right, my dear,
breed. It's nature's law.

35:21.671 --> 35:26.209
I trust my son and
heir will have a father
worthy of a baronet.

35:26.476 --> 35:29.279
But I trust your taste,
of course.

35:36.986 --> 35:42.358
- It is a sacrifice for both
of you. -A sacrifice to what?

35:43.026 --> 35:45.328
To God's will.

35:45.762 --> 35:48.465
Can't you come out from
under your pieties...

35:48.465 --> 35:51.835
...and speak to me
as a man to a woman?

35:52.268 --> 35:56.639
- You want me to condone
something you have done? -No.

35:57.607 --> 36:02.178
Perhaps if you look upon
things as a period of trial...

36:02.178 --> 36:05.782
...in time, you
will find your way.

36:08.084 --> 36:11.688
- Good afternoon,
Father. -Good afternoon.

36:23.967 --> 36:26.336
A period of trial.

36:38.248 --> 36:41.217
Keep still, Mrs. B.

36:42.719 --> 36:46.422
This is hard enough without
you fidgeting all the time.

36:55.932 --> 36:59.169
- Oh, it's you. -Not bad.

36:59.402 --> 37:04.007
- Want to play seriously? - If
you like. you'll probably win.

37:04.007 --> 37:06.709
I haven't quite got the
hang of playing this way.

37:07.177 --> 37:10.146
Well, it'll be a
change for me to win.

37:10.847 --> 37:14.350
I hear you did something
rather out of character today.

37:16.186 --> 37:19.189
- Went to church, did you? -Yes.

37:19.489 --> 37:21.257
What on earth for?

37:21.858 --> 37:25.528
I thought I'd book an
appointment with the Holy Ghost.

37:31.334 --> 37:32.969
Milady.

37:36.372 --> 37:37.607
Sit.

37:40.276 --> 37:44.247
- yes, Mellors? -Got
that key for you, milady.

37:44.881 --> 37:48.818
- Was it a lot of trouble?
-No. How could it be?
No trouble.

37:49.319 --> 37:52.455
- Thank you, then. -Come on.

38:04.934 --> 38:07.003
- Good morning darling.
-Morning.

38:07.403 --> 38:10.440
- Morning. -Morning. Am I late?

38:10.673 --> 38:13.843
- Not at all. -Did you
sleep well, milady?

38:13.843 --> 38:17.614
Thank you, Mrs. Bolton. Well,
I'll have some breakfast then.

38:17.981 --> 38:19.616
yes, see you later.

38:50.380 --> 38:52.115
Go in there.

39:01.925 --> 39:04.761
Come on, my little
ones, come on.

39:05.128 --> 39:07.830
Come on, my little
ones, come on.

39:17.907 --> 39:21.144
- Hello. -Hello.

39:39.929 --> 39:42.799
Shame about Sir
Clifford, isn't it Mrs. B?

39:42.799 --> 39:47.603
Fair, young wife and
this land and no children
to pass it on to.

39:47.603 --> 39:52.675
That shows how little you know.
Sir Clifford's getting stronger
all the time.

39:56.579 --> 39:59.148
Thank you, Robert.
That will be all.

40:08.758 --> 40:11.794
My prescription certainly
seems to have worked milady.

40:11.794 --> 40:16.833
- Yes, you've done wonders for
Sir Clifford. - I meant fresh
air, healthy activity.

40:17.233 --> 40:21.204
It's not much of a life for a
woman if her heart never works.

40:21.204 --> 40:21.237
It's not much of a life for a
woman if her heart never works.
There's many who
have no real hearts.

40:21.237 --> 40:24.307
There's many who
have no real hearts.

40:24.474 --> 40:28.978
But if you've got a heart, you
don't want to live for money
and things.

40:29.245 --> 40:30.980
I'm sure you're right.

40:31.247 --> 40:36.352
If there's something about you
makes one say more than one
should, it's because...

40:36.352 --> 40:41.891
...you're a true woman
and a body's heart burns
for you, not against you.

40:41.891 --> 40:44.227
I know you wouldn't do
anything against me.

40:44.227 --> 40:47.797
Neither shall anyone
else if I can help it.

41:04.480 --> 41:05.782
Good girl.

41:07.417 --> 41:09.419
- Hello. -Hello.

41:09.819 --> 41:11.320
You weren't ill then.

41:11.387 --> 41:14.557
No, nurse went away, so I
stayed with Sir Clifford.

41:14.924 --> 41:16.025
I see.

41:18.327 --> 41:23.232
- What lovely, soft creatures.
-Aye, pretty young things.

41:25.201 --> 41:26.836
- There. -Come, baby.

41:31.574 --> 41:35.311
- They don't like me. -Then
we'll find one that does.

41:36.045 --> 41:37.346
Go on.

41:49.492 --> 41:52.128
It's not worth crying for.

42:06.943 --> 42:10.113
There, there.

42:10.279 --> 42:12.315
It's all right.

42:47.517 --> 42:49.752
you're beautiful.

42:50.353 --> 42:53.222
So beautiful.

45:21.871 --> 45:26.175
I'm sorry I'm late. Why don't I
do that today? you're excused.

45:26.175 --> 45:29.045
- Very good, milady.
-What a nice idea.

45:29.045 --> 45:29.078
- Very good, milady.
-What a nice idea.
Want a game in a minute?

45:29.078 --> 45:31.247
Want a game in a minute?

45:32.381 --> 45:35.051
I don't want to beat you again.

45:36.085 --> 45:39.755
you won't today.
I've been practicing.

45:41.891 --> 45:44.694
- Don't go, Mrs. Bolton.
-Excuse me, milady.

45:45.061 --> 45:48.597
- Join us, you're part of
the family now. -Thank you.

45:48.597 --> 45:52.835
- How do you like your tea?
-Very strong, lots of sugar.

45:52.835 --> 45:55.171
Strong, sweet tea.

45:55.838 --> 45:58.240
I got the taste from my husband.

45:58.507 --> 46:02.378
- Is it many years since
he died? - I was 24.

46:02.378 --> 46:06.649
- How awful. -yes, same
age you were widowed, Con.

46:06.649 --> 46:06.682
- How awful. -yes, same
age you were widowed, Con.
Now, we're going to get you
back on your feet, aren't we?

46:06.682 --> 46:11.554
Now, we're going to get you
back on your feet, aren't we?

46:11.921 --> 46:15.224
- Yes Mrs. B. - I don't know
how you lived through it.

46:15.224 --> 46:16.826
I didn't think I could.

46:16.826 --> 46:22.131
The heart makes up for
a lot. I miss him God knows,
but I'll never forget him.

46:22.131 --> 46:25.701
I believe he'd never have left
me, and I'll never leave him.

46:25.701 --> 46:28.170
A lesson to us all, Con.

46:32.108 --> 46:35.144
I mean, that's very
touching, Mrs. B.

46:36.612 --> 46:40.049
- You'll never leave me,
will you Con? -Clifford.

46:40.049 --> 46:44.320
Once a wife in your heart,
always a wife, I say.

46:49.125 --> 46:51.427
Come on, Mrs. B.

46:51.794 --> 46:55.531
- Can't think straight. -Don't
you want to win all my money?

46:55.531 --> 46:55.564
- Can't think straight. -Don't
you want to win all my money?
- It's late. -Don't complain.

46:55.564 --> 46:59.368
- It's late. -Don't complain.

48:02.798 --> 48:04.467
Check.

48:06.602 --> 48:08.337
Very good.

48:09.472 --> 48:14.276
It must be early light now.
you can go to bed if you like.

48:14.276 --> 48:14.310
It must be early light now.
you can go to bed if you like.
Open the curtains before
you leave, would you?

48:14.310 --> 48:18.180
Open the curtains before
you leave, would you?

48:55.317 --> 48:58.220
- Where are you taking all this?
-Sir Clifford's instructions.

48:58.220 --> 49:01.156
- " Bury it in the attic,"
he said. -Where is he?

49:01.156 --> 49:05.528
- Talking to two gentlemen in
the library. -Thank you, Field.

49:06.729 --> 49:11.867
I believe that now is the right
time, but we simply must have
the bits modernized.

49:11.867 --> 49:17.206
Especially the Oakwood Pit.
That we can exploit down to
the last possibility. Once we--

49:17.206 --> 49:22.278
- Good morning, everybody.
-Gentlemen, my wife.

49:23.712 --> 49:24.980
How do you do?

49:24.980 --> 49:28.584
Darling, would you let
us talk in peace? Please!

49:29.118 --> 49:31.120
Now, where were we?

49:32.354 --> 49:34.256
Sit down.

50:14.296 --> 50:17.433
- Have I done
something wrong? -No.

50:18.601 --> 50:21.103
you think you've lowered
yourself with me?

50:21.103 --> 50:22.805
No.

52:33.969 --> 52:36.905
Push! Good. And the other side.

52:37.139 --> 52:39.074
And push, push.

52:39.074 --> 52:42.911
you must strengthen these
shoulders. And rest.

52:46.715 --> 52:51.220
- Do you really think there's
hope? -Do you trust me?

52:52.421 --> 52:56.358
- Yes, Mrs. B.
-Well, then, try again.

52:58.026 --> 53:00.796
Lift and push.

53:00.796 --> 53:02.698
Good, good, good.

53:02.698 --> 53:04.967
And rest. Good.

53:06.168 --> 53:08.937
you're lovely to me.

53:09.404 --> 53:13.509
- So lovely to
touch. -Don't cry.

53:14.576 --> 53:16.845
I read something one day:

53:21.216 --> 53:25.187
" I will experience
everything in life...

53:25.187 --> 53:29.391
...so on the final
journey to my death...

53:29.391 --> 53:33.896
...the nights will not
be haunted by regret."

53:41.303 --> 53:43.605
So no need to cry.

53:43.939 --> 53:47.576
Don't worry, it's
really happiness.

53:58.754 --> 54:00.389
Where are the others?

54:00.522 --> 54:04.626
Sir Clifford is in the library
and asked not to be disturbed.

54:04.626 --> 54:07.830
Mrs. Bolton is taking a nap.

54:08.831 --> 54:12.801
- Well, it will be just
for me, then. -Yes, milady.

54:13.535 --> 54:15.671
This magazine came for you.

54:55.811 --> 54:57.279
Connie.

54:59.548 --> 55:03.285
My darling Connie.
Are you happy?

55:03.285 --> 55:06.521
- Why? -Because you
look so adorable.

55:06.755 --> 55:09.625
I couldn't bear it
if you were unhappy.

55:11.126 --> 55:12.761
So kind.

55:13.095 --> 55:17.499
I honestly think I should have
died. They should have let me.

55:17.733 --> 55:25.040
Clifford, don't. If
something is lost, it
needn't be all lost, need it?

55:25.040 --> 55:28.877
There's no reason for me to
live if nobody else wants
me to live.

55:30.579 --> 55:32.481
Just seeing you there then...

55:32.481 --> 55:37.286
...I thought you'd be
better off if I were
dead. Perhaps you knew it.

55:37.719 --> 55:40.589
I don't want you to die...

55:40.923 --> 55:45.193
...but it is cruel to make me
responsible for your living.

55:48.330 --> 55:51.033
you want to live, don't you?

55:51.767 --> 55:54.369
Darling, I'm sorry.

55:55.103 --> 55:57.506
I'm a real brute.

55:58.607 --> 56:01.476
Don't cry. Don't...

56:02.210 --> 56:04.613
...for my selfish sake.

56:04.913 --> 56:07.316
I'm not worthy of you.

56:13.622 --> 56:15.958
Wait here, Mellors.

56:19.127 --> 56:21.396
What are you doing here?

56:27.803 --> 56:30.305
yes, Mellors, what is it?

56:30.672 --> 56:36.278
I caught a couple of poachers,
sir, with snares and rabbits,
just come dawn this morning.

56:36.278 --> 56:39.548
- Where are they? -Outside, sir.

56:49.124 --> 56:51.893
What should I do about them?

56:52.294 --> 56:54.896
- Prosecute. -yes, sir.

56:54.896 --> 56:57.799
Is it necessary
to prosecute them?

56:58.000 --> 57:02.971
Is it necessary to poach
rabbits? Or anything
else for that matter?

57:05.307 --> 57:08.510
We'd have them all over the wood
if we didn't show them the law.

57:09.144 --> 57:12.714
- you were colliers,
weren't you? -yes, milady.

57:12.848 --> 57:16.051
you see, they're poaching
because they're hungry--

57:16.084 --> 57:18.520
Her ladyship is right.

57:18.820 --> 57:21.757
We won't prosecute. Let them go.

57:23.458 --> 57:26.995
- After you've thrashed
them. -Clifford!

57:33.702 --> 57:38.707
He'll thrash them,
or he'll consider his
employment here ended.

58:34.729 --> 58:36.031
Go on.

58:36.465 --> 58:37.599
Good!

58:58.787 --> 59:00.789
Thank you, Mellors.

59:08.463 --> 59:09.831
Come on, then.

59:45.567 --> 59:48.403
- you're late. - I meant to be.

59:48.937 --> 59:52.607
- Didn't you want me to be here?
- Is it only to be when you want
it to be now?

59:52.607 --> 59:52.641
- Didn't you want me to be here?
- Is it only to be when you want
it to be now?
-Well no, but--
-What happened to those poachers
that doesn't bother you?

59:52.641 --> 59:56.511
-Well no, but--
-What happened to those poachers
that doesn't bother you?

59:56.511 --> 1:00:00.849
- It didn't seem to bother you.
-Should I have disobeyed Sir
Clifford's orders?

1:00:00.882 --> 1:00:03.318
Oh, you would have
beaten them anyway. Here.

1:00:03.318 --> 1:00:03.351
Oh, you would have
beaten them anyway. Here.
- Even so. -Even so, milady.

1:00:03.351 --> 1:00:06.555
- Even so. -Even so, milady.

1:00:12.627 --> 1:00:15.030
Okay, I'm sorry.

1:00:21.703 --> 1:00:24.005
That's enough now.

1:00:27.976 --> 1:00:32.147
-Faster today. A couple more.

1:00:36.785 --> 1:00:38.620
That's good.

1:00:40.288 --> 1:00:43.592
To be honest, when we started...

1:00:43.592 --> 1:00:46.561
...I thought it was hopeless.

1:00:47.462 --> 1:00:50.932
But now I think you can do it.

1:00:52.300 --> 1:00:56.972
- What happens if you
have a child? - I should
like to have a child.

1:01:00.208 --> 1:01:02.611
What about Sir Clifford?

1:01:08.316 --> 1:01:11.653
Clifford talked about it.

1:01:12.187 --> 1:01:15.023
- He wants a son
and heir. -What?

1:01:16.725 --> 1:01:19.561
He knows about me?
- No.

1:01:20.862 --> 1:01:23.398
If you have a child,
you'll tell him?

1:01:23.398 --> 1:01:27.535
If he ever suspects about you,
I'd have to go ride away
somewhere.

1:01:27.535 --> 1:01:28.903
What for?

1:01:32.207 --> 1:01:34.709
I couldn't live without you...

1:01:34.709 --> 1:01:38.380
...but I couldn't live with
him if he knew about you.

1:01:45.186 --> 1:01:49.124
Wouldn't fret if you went away
and never was to see me again?

1:01:49.124 --> 1:01:52.527
Yes, I'd mind. I'd fret.

1:01:52.527 --> 1:01:56.831
- Should you mind?
-Aye, that I would.

1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:11.012
I should like you to lie
one night with me at my
cottage, just for once.

1:02:15.650 --> 1:02:17.619
I must go now.

1:02:36.671 --> 1:02:38.940
Sorry, milady.

1:02:41.409 --> 1:02:44.145
- Where's Sir Clifford?
-In the library.

1:02:44.145 --> 1:02:47.282
- Perhaps he didn't
hear. - I'll tell him.

1:02:47.615 --> 1:02:49.884
- Oh, Milady.
- Yes?

1:03:18.012 --> 1:03:22.317
- Aren't you coming in to
dinner? -Yes, I'm starving.

1:03:22.317 --> 1:03:25.053
I just want to finish
with these plans.

1:03:25.053 --> 1:03:27.722
What is it, the mine?

1:03:28.590 --> 1:03:32.694
I can't father a dynasty.
I can't paint like Renoir.

1:03:32.694 --> 1:03:34.696
It has to be business, Con.

1:03:34.696 --> 1:03:37.966
Immortality must be
the name Chatterley.

1:03:37.966 --> 1:03:40.301
We start with the mine.

1:03:40.902 --> 1:03:43.138
Are you listening to me?
- Yes, yes.

1:03:44.506 --> 1:03:48.676
We'll have to make sacrifices
at first of course, in
income and capital...

1:03:48.676 --> 1:03:50.879
...because we have to
modernize it.

1:03:52.647 --> 1:03:55.049
Good night, Clifford.

1:03:58.653 --> 1:04:01.956
Good night, Con. Sleep well.

1:04:25.246 --> 1:04:27.782
I was scared you
wouldn't come today.

1:04:30.118 --> 1:04:32.987
What do you come to
a fellow like me for?

1:04:32.987 --> 1:04:36.424
Because you can take it
or leave it as you please?

1:04:36.424 --> 1:04:39.194
I saw you once, washing.

1:04:39.494 --> 1:04:43.198
- I thought you
were beautiful. -Me?

1:04:44.032 --> 1:04:47.802
your body was
beautiful. I wanted you.

1:04:47.802 --> 1:04:49.704
My body, beautiful?

1:04:50.071 --> 1:04:53.274
To you? As knows all
the tiptop young fellas?

1:04:53.274 --> 1:04:56.811
- I don't mean handsome.
-Handsome is as handsome does.

1:04:57.145 --> 1:04:59.614
you don't take me
serious, do you?

1:04:59.714 --> 1:05:02.917
What am I to you?
What do your sort say?

1:05:03.017 --> 1:05:04.919
A fucker?

1:05:06.154 --> 1:05:08.456
No, lover.

1:05:08.957 --> 1:05:11.326
you are my lover.

1:05:18.466 --> 1:05:21.402
you wouldn't marry
me if you was free.

1:05:21.769 --> 1:05:23.738
you wouldn't want me to.

1:05:24.072 --> 1:05:26.608
If you weren't
above me, I should.

1:05:26.741 --> 1:05:30.044
But you're above.
you look down on me.

1:05:32.180 --> 1:05:35.283
No, I'm grateful to you.

1:05:37.252 --> 1:05:39.654
And me, I am too.

1:05:39.687 --> 1:05:42.824
This is extra, but
I don't mean this.

1:05:45.927 --> 1:05:47.562
When I wait...

1:05:47.829 --> 1:05:52.233
...I look across the grounds
and you don't come, I say:

1:05:52.333 --> 1:05:54.769
"She wants none
of you today, lad.

1:05:54.802 --> 1:05:58.172
you best hang up your
gun and go home."

1:05:58.206 --> 1:06:00.975
- you think nothing
of me. - I do.

1:06:01.009 --> 1:06:02.877
Not me.

1:06:05.246 --> 1:06:07.882
It's this you enjoy.

1:06:09.784 --> 1:06:11.653
And that's all.

1:06:12.186 --> 1:06:14.088
And that's all.

1:06:25.567 --> 1:06:27.802
No, you're wrong.

1:06:28.136 --> 1:06:30.071
I do love you.

1:06:30.471 --> 1:06:35.443
And I want to sleep with you
in your cottage, and I will.

1:06:36.010 --> 1:06:37.679
When?

1:06:37.779 --> 1:06:41.349
I want you to tell me
my body is beautiful.

1:06:45.753 --> 1:06:49.490
I would be your wife, but
I can't leave Clifford.

1:06:49.624 --> 1:06:53.595
He understands I
need somebody. you.

1:06:53.795 --> 1:06:56.397
Don't you understand I need him?

1:06:56.731 --> 1:06:59.167
What would he say if
he knew it were me?

1:06:59.167 --> 1:07:03.137
I don't know. I'll
never tell him.

1:07:03.204 --> 1:07:07.942
you'd never tell him,
because you know you'd
lose him right enough.

1:07:08.443 --> 1:07:10.912
It's nothing to do with
your class or my class.

1:07:10.979 --> 1:07:15.149
It's got everything to
do with it. Everything.

1:07:16.651 --> 1:07:19.020
Then we'd better say goodbye.

1:07:23.124 --> 1:07:26.894
you've given me more
than I've ever given you.

1:07:28.329 --> 1:07:31.165
you must really hate me.

1:07:32.500 --> 1:07:35.303
I mustn't come here anymore.

1:07:36.237 --> 1:07:38.973
Wait, I don't want you to go.

1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:42.977
Say you'll always come back here
Say something that will keep
until you come back here again.

1:07:43.011 --> 1:07:45.246
What shall I say?

1:07:46.080 --> 1:07:49.350
Say you'll never break
it off between us.

1:07:51.386 --> 1:07:53.588
I never will.

1:07:54.389 --> 1:07:56.658
Then let's make it legal.

1:08:05.667 --> 1:08:09.704
Will you drive your nail into
this tree for good and for all?
- Yes.

1:08:34.862 --> 1:08:39.367
- When will you stay the
night with me? -Soon.

1:09:00.154 --> 1:09:05.226
- What are you doing? - I've
been watching the sunset.

1:09:49.270 --> 1:09:51.239
That's all right.

1:09:52.173 --> 1:09:54.208
Where are you going today?

1:09:54.275 --> 1:09:58.279
I'm going to the woods, see
if the chicks have hatched.

1:10:13.161 --> 1:10:15.930
Can you open the gate for me?

1:10:23.104 --> 1:10:24.906
Thank you.

1:10:28.509 --> 1:10:31.646
Why have you brought him here?
I thought you're to be
my wife in the woods.

1:10:31.646 --> 1:10:33.514
And his in the rest
of the world.

1:10:33.614 --> 1:10:35.817
It was his idea to come here.

1:10:44.258 --> 1:10:45.459
Well, he knows?

1:10:45.459 --> 1:10:48.529
- He can't. -He
must be suspicious.

1:11:00.274 --> 1:11:01.542
Connie!

1:11:01.709 --> 1:11:05.279
you'd better come to the
cottage soon, just in case.

1:11:06.180 --> 1:11:10.051
- Tonight. -Aye, tonight.

1:11:13.888 --> 1:11:18.326
- Connie, where the devil
are you? - I'm coming.

1:11:18.426 --> 1:11:20.094
It's all right.

1:11:20.094 --> 1:11:23.698
I thought I was going
to sink in, that's all.

1:11:31.772 --> 1:11:34.775
Come on. Push, push!

1:11:43.951 --> 1:11:47.321
It's no good. We're stuck.

1:11:49.023 --> 1:11:51.392
Mellors!

1:11:54.929 --> 1:11:57.798
Mellors!

1:12:02.637 --> 1:12:06.173
Mellors. Am I
caught up somewhere?

1:12:08.309 --> 1:12:10.211
I should say you are, sir.

1:12:10.278 --> 1:12:13.748
- Shall I give you a push?
-No, let the motor do it.

1:12:13.781 --> 1:12:15.716
I'll try again.

1:12:22.456 --> 1:12:24.859
Yes, you can push.

1:12:34.101 --> 1:12:36.404
Come on, man, push!

1:12:36.771 --> 1:12:38.472
Push!

1:12:40.775 --> 1:12:42.777
Push, Mellors!

1:12:45.613 --> 1:12:47.581
Come on! Push.

1:12:49.183 --> 1:12:52.320
Come on. Put your
back into it, man.

1:12:52.820 --> 1:12:53.554
Push!

1:12:53.621 --> 1:12:56.424
- Have you got the brake
on, sir? -No, of course not.

1:12:57.291 --> 1:12:59.193
Wait a minute.

1:13:02.563 --> 1:13:04.699
The gears have gone.

1:13:05.199 --> 1:13:07.668
You'll have to
push me in neutral.

1:13:10.104 --> 1:13:12.740
Well, give him a hand, Connie.

1:13:19.347 --> 1:13:23.250
[in French]
It is a shame to be at
the mercy of anyone.

1:13:35.529 --> 1:13:38.065
Mrs. Bolton, can
you send for Newman?

1:13:38.099 --> 1:13:41.602
Don't bother him.
Mellors can carry me.

1:13:41.736 --> 1:13:45.406
- Can't you, Mellors? -Yes, sir.

1:13:52.747 --> 1:13:56.650
Connie, tidy my
chair away, will you?

1:14:02.456 --> 1:14:04.792
Not too heavy am I, Mellors?

1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:14.769
Don't touch those!

1:14:15.269 --> 1:14:17.271
Thanks awfully, Mellors.

1:14:17.838 --> 1:14:19.373
Thank you, sir.

1:14:19.940 --> 1:14:24.178
- Did you enjoy your walk?
-Yes, thank you very much.

1:14:25.513 --> 1:14:28.949
He's really quite a good
sort, don't you think?

1:14:29.717 --> 1:14:32.920
Mrs. B, ask Field to
run me a bath, will you?

1:14:33.921 --> 1:14:38.125
He thinks he's the whole hill
of beans, as the Americans say.

1:14:40.361 --> 1:14:42.396
People like him...

1:14:42.463 --> 1:14:45.866
...even Mrs. Bolton,
nice as she is...

1:14:45.933 --> 1:14:48.502
...they've no real
respect for us.

1:14:48.569 --> 1:14:52.640
For what we've got,
perhaps, not what we are.

1:14:52.706 --> 1:14:56.477
Ought they to? Do we respect
them for what they are?

1:14:56.510 --> 1:14:59.246
What are they, apart
from what they do for us?

1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:02.383
Would you raise a shout
about his immortal soul?

1:15:02.416 --> 1:15:05.986
He's just so much
live human meat.

1:15:06.020 --> 1:15:07.822
Thank you, Mrs. B.

1:15:55.469 --> 1:15:57.371
So you've come, then?

1:15:57.438 --> 1:15:59.273
Obviously.

1:16:07.348 --> 1:16:10.584
Is it all right?
you wanted to come?

1:16:10.818 --> 1:16:13.821
Of course. Otherwise I wouldn't.

1:16:15.656 --> 1:16:17.958
I'm glad you did.

1:16:20.227 --> 1:16:22.997
I'm so glad you did.

1:16:33.941 --> 1:16:36.477
It's cozy in here.

1:16:55.095 --> 1:16:58.566
- They're pretty. -The flowers.

1:17:04.872 --> 1:17:07.741
- So that's what she
looks like. -Who?

1:17:07.841 --> 1:17:10.911
- It is your wife, isn't
it? -How do you know?

1:17:11.178 --> 1:17:13.781
I know a lot about you
one way or another.

1:17:13.948 --> 1:17:16.317
Well, we didn't come
here to talk about her.

1:17:17.651 --> 1:17:21.155
No, but I have to
think about her.

1:17:21.522 --> 1:17:24.358
After all, you must
have liked her once.

1:17:24.491 --> 1:17:29.697
She ran off. She's not my wife
now, so there's an end to it.

1:20:22.870 --> 1:20:24.505
Connie?

1:23:10.137 --> 1:23:12.239
you're crazy.

1:23:12.472 --> 1:23:14.975
you look a figure out
here in the night.

1:23:15.576 --> 1:23:19.880
- Am I still beautiful?
-Aye, under the moon.

1:23:20.113 --> 1:23:23.350
you're more of the
moon than this world.

1:23:24.184 --> 1:23:29.990
The sky is real, the woods
are real, and you are real.

1:23:38.899 --> 1:23:43.604
- I am your wife in the
woods. -Aye, my wife anywhere.

1:23:43.670 --> 1:23:46.039
I never had a wife before.

1:23:46.406 --> 1:23:49.776
I never knew what a
woman was like before.

1:27:47.848 --> 1:27:49.883
It's day.

1:27:51.618 --> 1:27:53.920
We have time.

1:27:57.490 --> 1:28:00.927
Now I know what it's like
to sleep with someone.

1:28:01.061 --> 1:28:04.798
- What? -Nothing.

1:28:08.435 --> 1:28:10.904
I should go now.

1:28:13.673 --> 1:28:16.009
Stay with me.

1:28:19.412 --> 1:28:21.448
It's cold.

1:28:22.382 --> 1:28:25.485
- What's wrong? -What
sort of man am I?

1:28:25.585 --> 1:28:29.756
Running around at the
call of a paralyzed man
and fucking his wife.

1:28:30.757 --> 1:28:34.761
Aye, and you... What sort of
a mate am I for you?
I know you like me but--

1:28:34.794 --> 1:28:36.997
How can you respect
me except for fucking?

1:28:36.997 --> 1:28:42.002
- And almost anyone would
do for that. -Here, no
other man would do for that.

1:28:45.105 --> 1:28:48.375
I can't go among your sort of
people, and you can't come
down to mine.

1:28:48.408 --> 1:28:53.380
- Does it matter all that social
stuff? -Aye, it matters.

1:28:53.980 --> 1:28:55.749
How much?

1:28:56.116 --> 1:28:57.651
This much?

1:28:58.118 --> 1:28:59.920
This much?

1:29:05.225 --> 1:29:07.560
you must go.

1:29:30.450 --> 1:29:33.586
We'll have another
time like this.

1:29:55.108 --> 1:29:56.509
Clifford?

1:30:07.220 --> 1:30:08.922
Clifford.

1:30:09.522 --> 1:30:12.625
you could tell me
it's all untrue.

1:30:13.593 --> 1:30:18.665
"Go ahead, Connie. Take a man if
you wish, only never leave me."

1:30:18.698 --> 1:30:24.671
- A man, Connie, not a
damn-- -Peasant? Slave?

1:30:24.704 --> 1:30:28.274
What if you got pregnant,
milady? Think of that.

1:30:28.775 --> 1:30:30.577
Think of me.

1:30:30.977 --> 1:30:33.279
Think of the future.

1:30:35.181 --> 1:30:40.520
I thought of who it
might be, but that
damned Oliver Mellors....

1:30:40.653 --> 1:30:42.889
Oliver, is it?

1:30:44.891 --> 1:30:48.028
you never even asked his name.

1:30:49.996 --> 1:30:54.801
I've made all the arrangements
for you. I sent a telegram to
your sister...

1:30:54.834 --> 1:30:58.038
...telling her you'll be on the
10:30 train to London...

1:30:58.071 --> 1:31:01.274
...and the 3:30 boat
train on from Victoria.

1:31:03.943 --> 1:31:06.880
We both need time to think.

1:31:13.453 --> 1:31:17.023
- Have a good journey,
milady. -Thank you, Field.

1:31:22.162 --> 1:31:24.364
Could you do something for me?

1:31:24.697 --> 1:31:26.833
Please tell Mellors.

1:32:20.553 --> 1:32:25.658
Darling, if I left my
husband, you can leave yours.

1:32:27.327 --> 1:32:31.564
you've made the first move
with this gamekeeper chap.

1:32:31.631 --> 1:32:36.369
Why are the second, third and
fourth moves so difficult?

1:32:36.469 --> 1:32:40.073
It's not as easy for
me as it is for you.

1:32:40.473 --> 1:32:44.811
I don't like seeing you like
this. I'll make you smile again.

1:32:45.778 --> 1:32:48.448
Can you wait for
me here, please?

1:32:50.950 --> 1:32:54.787
Connie, look what
I've found for you.

1:32:54.988 --> 1:32:56.923
Which one do you want?

1:32:57.624 --> 1:33:02.462
Not for me. Have them
both. I'll see you later.

1:33:43.336 --> 1:33:47.774
Are you listening to me? How can
you stand it here all the time?

1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:52.512
I quite enjoy it here.
It makes my dilemma
seem even more heroic.

1:33:52.545 --> 1:33:57.050
Dilemma? This letter's
arrived for you.

1:33:58.251 --> 1:34:01.354
I hope that it's good news.

1:34:01.788 --> 1:34:03.923
I'll see you in a minute.

1:34:31.918 --> 1:34:34.020
Connie, dear, come on.

1:34:34.721 --> 1:34:36.889
Don't you want to go swimming?

1:35:00.980 --> 1:35:03.549
Honestly, Connie,
you're such a bore.

1:35:03.850 --> 1:35:06.986
Clifford arranges it perfectly
by sending you into exile...

1:35:07.053 --> 1:35:12.725
...and all you do is moon around
doing the exact opposite of what
everyone else wants to do.

1:35:12.792 --> 1:35:15.695
Pregnant women are
allowed the occasional whim.

1:35:16.229 --> 1:35:21.501
- You can't be pregnant.
- I am. I've seen a doctor.

1:35:22.268 --> 1:35:24.771
Absolutely awful.

1:35:25.638 --> 1:35:29.042
Well I think it's the best thing
that ever could of happened.

1:35:29.242 --> 1:35:31.077
Don't be silly.

1:35:31.611 --> 1:35:36.249
- What are we going to
do with you and it?
-Get me back to England.

1:35:59.972 --> 1:36:02.975
- Clifford? -Wait.

1:36:05.278 --> 1:36:08.081
- Welcome back, milady. -Hello.

1:36:09.582 --> 1:36:14.454
Isn't it simply wonderful?
And all Mrs. B's doing.

1:36:17.056 --> 1:36:21.694
My encouragement, perhaps,
Sir Clifford, your will-power.

1:36:39.979 --> 1:36:43.049
Be careful! Are you all right?

1:36:44.517 --> 1:36:48.454
It's the devil of an
effort but really worth it.

1:36:48.921 --> 1:36:52.225
- Going down the mine
was the triumph. -What?

1:36:52.558 --> 1:36:55.995
I wrote you about it.
Didn't you get my letters?

1:36:56.028 --> 1:36:58.431
I wrote you about everything.

1:37:09.342 --> 1:37:11.043
Oliver?

1:37:11.744 --> 1:37:15.948
Milady? Oh, he don't
work here no more.

1:37:16.382 --> 1:37:18.484
Was it anything important?

1:37:18.818 --> 1:37:21.754
No, thank you. I'm sorry
to have troubled you.

1:37:35.001 --> 1:37:40.573
- What's happened to
Mellors? -He's gone. Sir
Clifford dismissed him.

1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:42.442
I see.

1:37:43.342 --> 1:37:45.912
Clifford, you'd better
tell me everything.

1:37:45.978 --> 1:37:47.747
- About what? -Mellors.

1:37:47.814 --> 1:37:49.515
Mellors?

1:37:50.583 --> 1:37:53.920
Connie, I wrote you about it.
It was in my letters.

1:37:53.953 --> 1:37:56.856
I didn't read your blasted
letters. Now tell me everything.

1:37:56.856 --> 1:38:00.059
I thought you didn't answer
them, because of that.

1:38:00.660 --> 1:38:05.331
Then when I heard you were
coming back, I thought
you'd forgiven me.

1:38:05.364 --> 1:38:07.667
Because of what?

1:38:10.136 --> 1:38:11.871
He really didn't want to
stay you know.

1:38:11.871 --> 1:38:16.409
You sent me away, and
you dismissed him.
I can't believe it.

1:38:16.843 --> 1:38:20.546
I didn't want you to
become too fond of him.

1:38:21.647 --> 1:38:24.951
I know what we agreed about
you having a lover...

1:38:25.017 --> 1:38:29.322
...but I did it because
of you, to save you pain.

1:38:29.889 --> 1:38:33.192
After all, we did talk
about a son and heir...

1:38:33.226 --> 1:38:35.728
...and if you'd started to see
too much of him...

1:38:35.761 --> 1:38:38.831
...who knows what sort of little
bastards I'd have to
give my name to.

1:38:38.831 --> 1:38:43.569
- Your name. -Con, surely
you understand my position.

1:38:43.603 --> 1:38:45.705
Clifford, I'm pregnant.

1:38:45.905 --> 1:38:49.775
He's the father, and
your name be damned.

1:39:06.626 --> 1:39:11.430
I tell you, love, work
outside the mine is
getting hard to come by.

1:39:22.875 --> 1:39:26.045
- What are you doing here?
- I just got back today.

1:39:26.078 --> 1:39:29.448
- Did you, now? What
do you want? -Please--

1:39:29.448 --> 1:39:32.818
Look, it can't be the way it
was, so there's an end to it.

1:39:32.852 --> 1:39:35.688
But don't you want me anymore?

1:39:45.464 --> 1:39:47.700
I want to be with you.

1:39:49.635 --> 1:39:52.939
I don't want to miss
you all my life.

1:39:55.174 --> 1:39:59.745
Well if you hate me, how can you
work here and still slave
for the Chatterleys?

1:39:59.779 --> 1:40:01.881
- Have you heard
of Canada? -What?

1:40:01.881 --> 1:40:06.852
Canada, 14 pounds a week when
I get there. I'm working to
earn my fare.

1:40:06.886 --> 1:40:10.289
- You've got to listen to me,
I've got it all planned-- -No.

1:40:10.723 --> 1:40:13.426
How can you like
the likes of me?

1:40:15.227 --> 1:40:19.065
- Oliver, I'm
pregnant. -Damn you.

1:40:19.231 --> 1:40:22.935
So you got what you want, and
Sir Clifford gets a child.

1:40:23.069 --> 1:40:26.606
No, it will have my
maiden name or your name.

1:40:26.639 --> 1:40:30.610
There will be no
other Chatterley.
Clifford will be the last.

1:40:30.743 --> 1:40:33.980
I'll leave him, whether
you come with me or not.

1:40:34.013 --> 1:40:37.883
And where will we go? What
will we do? What will I do?

1:40:38.384 --> 1:40:40.953
You could run your own farm.

1:40:41.821 --> 1:40:45.157
- How? -We could use my income.

1:40:45.825 --> 1:40:47.226
- No.

1:40:47.526 --> 1:40:50.463
Can't you see you
live like a slave?

1:40:50.563 --> 1:40:54.834
- I've made myself free. you can
be too. -I'll not be a kept man.

1:40:54.934 --> 1:40:59.538
And our child, no class. The
best of you, the best of me.

1:40:59.939 --> 1:41:01.674
Do you remember?

1:41:02.141 --> 1:41:06.012
" My nights will not
be haunted by regrets."

1:41:13.586 --> 1:41:19.125
- So you really think
I'm beautiful? -You are.

1:41:23.262 --> 1:41:26.332
- How long to go? -Seven months.

1:41:26.399 --> 1:41:30.202
We'll see, we'll see.

1:41:37.910 --> 1:41:39.578
Connie?
