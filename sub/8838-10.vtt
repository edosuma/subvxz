47:58.835 --> 48:00.587
COME ON.
TRY AND DRINK THIS.

48:00.754 --> 48:03.590
JUST DRINK
A LITTLE BIT.

48:03.757 --> 48:05.842
THERE YOU ARE.

48:06.009 --> 48:08.053
THERE YOU GO.

48:08.220 --> 48:10.514
THERE YOU GO.

48:29.074 --> 48:30.325
I THINK YOU AND ME

48:30.492 --> 48:32.578
BETTER GET A FEW
THINGS STRAIGHT.

48:34.913 --> 48:36.206
I'M STAYING WITH YOU

48:36.373 --> 48:38.500
WHETHER YOU
LIKE IT OR NOT.

48:38.667 --> 48:40.586
DOC SAID IT'S GONNA
TAKE A FEW MONTHS,

48:40.752 --> 48:42.504
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT.

48:42.671 --> 48:44.089
WHEN YOU ARE,
YOU CAN DO

48:44.256 --> 48:45.591
WHAT YOU WANT
WITH YOUR LIFE,

48:45.757 --> 48:49.219
BUT UNTIL THEN,
YOU'RE GOING TO DO
JUST WHAT I SAY.

48:49.386 --> 48:50.721
THAT MEANS YOU'RE
GOING TO REST,

48:50.887 --> 48:53.724
AND YOU'RE GONNA
GET USED TO ME
BEING AROUND.

48:53.890 --> 48:56.727
SEE, RIGHT OR WRONG,
I FEEL RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOU.

48:56.893 --> 48:59.229
I CAN TAKE
A LITTLE BIT OF
GUILT IN MY LIFE,

48:59.396 --> 49:01.481
BUT YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO PUT
ANY MORE ON ME.

49:01.648 --> 49:03.066
WHEN YOU'RE WELL
ENOUGH TO TRAVEL,

49:03.233 --> 49:04.568
I'LL PUT YOU
ON THE STAGE,

49:04.735 --> 49:06.903
AND THAT WILL BE
THE END OF IT.

49:12.576 --> 49:16.330
THE MISSIS SENT OVER
A POT OF SOUP.
I'LL GET YOU SOME.

49:21.752 --> 49:23.420
I AIN'T HUNGRY!

49:26.632 --> 49:28.759
YOU'LL EAT IT.

51:56.740 --> 51:58.408
YEAH.

52:09.169 --> 52:10.879
KAGAN!

52:14.090 --> 52:16.009
KAGAN!

52:25.393 --> 52:27.020
KAGAN!

52:28.855 --> 52:30.273
KAGAN!

52:36.947 --> 52:39.115
[HUMMING]

52:39.282 --> 52:42.828
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU AFRAID I WAS
GOING TO JUMP?

53:21.616 --> 53:24.536
OH, COME ON,
NOW, MR. JAKE.
YOU OWE ME ONE.

53:24.703 --> 53:26.830
PLUS YOU GOT
A WHOLE STABLE OF
FIGHTERS OUT THERE,

53:26.997 --> 53:29.583
AND I'M JUST ASKING
YOU TO, KIND OF,
PUSH ONE MY WAY.

53:29.749 --> 53:31.585
LOOK, HE CAN BE RAW,
JUST AS LONG AS

53:31.751 --> 53:33.336
HE GOT A LITTLE BIT
OF POTENTIAL.

53:33.503 --> 53:36.047
LOOK, MOODY,
I DON'T OWE YOU NOTHING.

53:36.214 --> 53:38.508
AND I AIN'T LAYIN' OFF
ANY FIGHTERS ON YOU

53:38.675 --> 53:39.885
THAT I THINK
I CAN MAKE MONEY WITH.

53:40.051 --> 53:41.428
OH, COME ON, MR. JAKE.

53:41.595 --> 53:43.847
I THOUGHT YOU WAS
A FRIEND OF MINE!

53:44.014 --> 53:45.307
WELL, WE AIN'T.

53:45.473 --> 53:48.101
AND WITHOUT ME AS A FRIEND,
YOU AIN'T GOT NONE.

53:48.268 --> 53:49.561
ALL RIGHT.

53:49.728 --> 53:51.771
LOOK, HE DON'T
HAVE TO BE ONE OF
YOUR GOOD FIGHTERS.

53:51.938 --> 53:55.275
YOU GOT A BOY
OUT THERE THAT CAN
TAKE A PUNCH?

53:55.442 --> 53:57.360
YEAH.

53:57.527 --> 54:00.071
YEAH, IF IT'LL GET YOU
OFF MY BACK.

54:00.238 --> 54:03.199
HEY, MOODY, DIDN'T YOU USED
TO HANDLE JOE KAGAN?

54:03.366 --> 54:04.868
YEAH, A WHILE BACK.

54:05.035 --> 54:06.411
I GOT HIS KID
OUT HERE.

54:06.578 --> 54:08.538
WHAT? COME ON,
NOW, MR. JAKE,

54:08.705 --> 54:10.206
YOU'RE FOOLING ME.

54:10.373 --> 54:13.043
NO, NO. TIM KAGAN.

54:13.209 --> 54:17.964
THAT'S HIM. THAT'S HIM
OVER THERE, IN THE RING.

54:20.759 --> 54:22.177
IS HE ANY GOOD?

54:22.344 --> 54:25.138
WELL, HE'S GOT A LOT
OF GUTS, YOU KNOW,
LIKE HIS OLD MAN,

54:25.305 --> 54:27.641
BUT...NAH,
HE AIN'T GOT IT. HE'S--

54:27.807 --> 54:30.769
HE'S TOO SLOW
AND HASN'T GOT THAT
KILLER INSTINCT.

54:30.936 --> 54:33.980
YEAH, BUT HE'D BE REAL BIG
ON THE HICK CIRCUIT.

54:34.147 --> 54:36.066
WHAT YOU WANT
FOR HIM?

54:37.067 --> 54:39.235
FOR FREE.
HE'S ALL YOURS, SEE?

54:39.402 --> 54:42.739
JUST SO YOU
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T
BOTHER ME ANYMORE.

54:44.032 --> 54:47.702
THANK YOU, MR. JAKE.
THANK YOU KINDLY.

55:08.765 --> 55:11.059
HOLD IT! HOLD IT!
THAT'S ENOUGH.

55:13.228 --> 55:15.689
BOY, THEM SURE ARE
SOME HEAVY PUNCHES.

55:15.855 --> 55:17.065
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

55:17.232 --> 55:18.358
TIM KAGAN.

55:18.525 --> 55:20.151
WHAT? TIM KAGAN?

55:20.318 --> 55:23.446
LORD HAVE MERCY.
MY NAME IS MOODY.

55:23.613 --> 55:25.824
I USED TO HANDLE
YOUR DADDY.

55:30.036 --> 55:32.914
OH, YEAH?
YOU SEEN HIM LATELY?

55:33.081 --> 55:34.958
NO, NOT
FOR A WHILE NOW.

55:35.125 --> 55:36.710
ME NEITHER.

55:45.468 --> 55:48.263
I DO RECALL
YOUR DADDY TELLING
ME HE HAD A BOY.

55:48.430 --> 55:51.599
YEAH? DID HE TELL YOU
THAT HE RAN OUT
ON ME AND MY MA?

55:51.766 --> 55:55.937
HE WROTE HER A COUPLE
OF TIMES, SAID HE WAS
GOING TO SEND SOME MONEY.

55:56.104 --> 55:58.231
NEVER SENT A PENNY.

55:59.357 --> 56:01.985
WELL, I DON'T RECOLLECT
NOTHING ABOUT THAT.

56:02.152 --> 56:06.031
MY MA WORKED IN A LAUNDRY
TILL IT KILLED HER.

56:06.197 --> 56:08.491
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
STOP PUNCHING THAT BAG?

56:08.658 --> 56:11.494
SEE, I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GIVE YOU A BREAK.

56:11.661 --> 56:13.538
HOW?

56:13.705 --> 56:15.457
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
YOU GO WASH UP,

56:15.623 --> 56:19.085
AND THEN WE'LL GO
SOMEPLACE WHERE WE
CAN TALK BUSINESS.

56:20.754 --> 56:22.797
GO ON, NOW, SON.

56:24.507 --> 56:26.134
OK.

56:38.688 --> 56:42.025
OOH! BOY. PLOWING
SURE IS WORK.

56:42.192 --> 56:46.321
FEEL LIKE I
JUST WENT 20 ROUNDS
WITH PADDY O'NEILL.

56:46.488 --> 56:48.448
HA HA!
DID YOU WIN IT?

56:48.615 --> 56:50.533
NO. I NEVER COULD
WHIP THAT IRISHMAN.

56:50.700 --> 56:52.118
HA HA HA!

56:52.285 --> 56:56.539
BUT YOU KNOW,
IT'S, UH, A GOOD
FEELING, THOUGH.

56:56.706 --> 56:58.666
YEAH. I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

56:58.833 --> 57:00.752
IT GETS EVEN BETTER
WHEN YOU SEE THAT CORN

57:00.919 --> 57:02.921
STANDING OVER
THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD.

57:03.088 --> 57:04.714
HOW LONG THAT
GOING TO TAKE?

57:04.881 --> 57:07.675
TOO LONG FOR YOU
TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT.

57:10.178 --> 57:11.679
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

57:11.846 --> 57:15.683
IT MEANS YOU'RE FIT
TO TRAVEL NOW, ANYTIME
YOU WANT TO GO.

57:19.437 --> 57:22.440
YOU, UH, SURE
I'M WELL ENOUGH?

57:22.607 --> 57:25.527
DOC BAKER THINKS SO.
I BET YOU'RE GLAD, TOO.

57:25.693 --> 57:27.779
GET SOME PRIVACY
FOR A CHANGE, HUH?

57:27.946 --> 57:29.572
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
SURE WILL.

57:29.739 --> 57:32.826
MY STOMACH TELLS ME
IT'S TIME FOR SUPPER.
YOU READY?

57:32.992 --> 57:34.619
OH, YEAH.
BE RIGHT IN.

57:34.786 --> 57:37.080
DON'T BE LATE IF YOU
WANT A HOT BISCUIT.

57:37.247 --> 57:38.623
MM.

58:05.608 --> 58:07.819
YOU SURE YOU
WON'T HAVE SOME
MORE, JOSEPH?

58:07.986 --> 58:09.863
OH, NO, MA'AM.
THANK YOU.

58:10.029 --> 58:12.448
YOU SURE CAN
EAT A LOT.

58:12.615 --> 58:13.658
LAURA.

58:13.825 --> 58:14.659
[JOE LAUGHS]

58:14.826 --> 58:16.619
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

58:16.786 --> 58:18.663
YOU CAN BLAME THAT
ON HER FATHER

58:18.830 --> 58:22.250
AND THE GOOD CLEAN AIR
OF WALNUT GROVE.

58:23.459 --> 58:26.171
HAVEN'T FELT THIS GOOD
IN 20 YEARS.

58:26.337 --> 58:27.797
WE'RE GLAD.

58:27.964 --> 58:30.008
AND I OWE Y'ALL A LOT.

58:30.175 --> 58:32.093
COME ON. YOU DON'T
OWE US ANYTHING.

58:32.260 --> 58:34.012
OH, YES, I DO.
I BEEN WELL ENOUGH

58:34.179 --> 58:36.806
TO MOVE ON DOWN THE ROAD
A LONG TIME AGO,

58:36.973 --> 58:40.185
BUT THE TRUTH IS...I...

58:40.351 --> 58:44.439
I LIKE IT HERE.
I'D LIKE TO SETTLE IN...

58:44.606 --> 58:46.149
PERMANENT.

58:47.901 --> 58:50.820
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I THINK I'D BETTER
GIVE YOU SOMETHING

58:50.987 --> 58:52.780
I'VE BEEN HOLDING
FOR YOU.

58:57.243 --> 58:58.870
HERE WE GO.

59:00.205 --> 59:01.456
WHAT'S THIS?

59:01.623 --> 59:02.999
IT'S YOUR MONEY--$50.

59:03.166 --> 59:04.876
I'VE BEEN KEEPING IT
IN A SAFE PLACE.

59:05.043 --> 59:06.669
THAT'S THE PURSE.
IT AIN'T MINE.

59:06.836 --> 59:09.005
LOOK, NO ARGUMENTS.
YOU WANT TO SETTLE IN
HERE, YOU NEED A STAKE,

59:09.172 --> 59:11.007
GET A LITTLE
PIECE OF LAND.

59:11.174 --> 59:12.217
CHARLES, I--

59:12.383 --> 59:14.219
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO
WHAT I SAY, REMEMBER?

59:14.385 --> 59:16.262
BESIDES, I WANT YOU
TO HAVE YOUR OWN PLACE.

59:16.429 --> 59:18.348
I'M TIRED
OF BUNKING WITH YOU.

59:18.514 --> 59:20.475
YOU SNORE, JOSEPH.

59:21.726 --> 59:22.852
THANK YOU.

59:23.019 --> 59:25.521
LISTEN, THAT HARPER FARM
IS FOR SALE.

59:25.688 --> 59:27.148
IT'S A GOOD PIECE OF LAND.

59:27.315 --> 59:29.192
THEY'RE HOLDING THE PAPER
IN THE BANK AT SPRINGFIELD.

59:29.359 --> 59:32.570
IF YOU WANT, WE CAN
RIDE IN THERE NEXT WEEK
AND CLOSE THE DEAL.

59:32.737 --> 59:34.322
YOU BET I WANT.

59:34.489 --> 59:38.243
CAROLINE, I THINK
I'LL HAVE SOME MORE FOOD.

59:38.409 --> 59:40.662
[ALL LAUGHING]

59:55.134 --> 59:56.886
HOW MUCH LONGER
WE GOT?

59:57.053 --> 59:58.930
ABOUT ANOTHER
HOUR OR SO.

59:59.097 --> 1:00:01.224
GETTING A LITTLE
ANXIOUS, ARE YOU?

1:00:01.391 --> 1:00:03.518
I SUPPOSE SO.

1:00:03.685 --> 1:00:07.063
I NEVER HAVE OWNED
ANYTHING IN MY LIFETIME.

1:00:07.230 --> 1:00:10.233
NEVER SETTLED DOWN
ANYWHERE LONG ENOUGH,

1:00:10.400 --> 1:00:13.194
JUST FIGHTING FROM
ONE TOWN TO ANOTHER.

1:00:13.361 --> 1:00:15.822
HOW OLD WERE YOU
WHEN YOU GOT STARTED?

1:00:15.989 --> 1:00:19.158
I HAD MY FIRST MONEY
FIGHT, I WAS 14.

1:00:19.325 --> 1:00:22.120
HAD ME A WHITE
OWNER THEN.

1:00:22.287 --> 1:00:26.416
FOUGHT 10 YEAR SO I
COULD BUY MYSELF FREE.

1:00:26.582 --> 1:00:29.252
DID YOU LIKE IT?
THE FIGHTING, I MEAN?

1:00:29.419 --> 1:00:32.046
YEAH. YEAH, I DID.

1:00:32.213 --> 1:00:36.843
ONLIEST WAY I COULD
HIT A WHITE MAN
AND NOT GET HUNG.

1:00:37.010 --> 1:00:39.095
HA HA HA!

1:00:44.267 --> 1:00:47.937
NEVER DREAMED
BACK THEN I'D END UP
BEING A FARMER.

1:00:48.104 --> 1:00:51.607
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
TO DO IN THIS WORLD
BESIDES FIGHTING.

1:00:53.109 --> 1:00:55.653
SOMEBODY TOLD ME
THAT ONCE.

1:01:21.929 --> 1:01:23.639
THERE'S THE BANK
RIGHT OVER THERE.

1:01:23.806 --> 1:01:26.392
I'LL PUT THE TEAM
UP AT THE LIVERY
AND THEN MEET YOU.

1:01:26.559 --> 1:01:27.643
RIGHT.

1:01:27.810 --> 1:01:29.479
NOW, THE BANK MANAGER'S
NAME'S CARTER.

1:01:29.645 --> 1:01:32.857
YOU CAN GO IN
AND GET STARTED
WITHOUT ME IF YOU WANT.

1:01:33.024 --> 1:01:34.609
I THINK I'LL WAIT.

1:01:34.776 --> 1:01:37.153
I AIN'T SPENT
TOO MUCH TIME IN BANKS.

1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:41.324
ALL RIGHT. SUIT YOURSELF.
JUST BE A FEW MINUTES.

1:02:36.379 --> 1:02:41.175
HOLD IT VERY STEADY,
NOW, MR. KAGAN.

1:02:43.636 --> 1:02:44.554
THANK YOU.

1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:46.055
JUST A FEW MORE
QUESTIONS, MR. KAGAN.

1:02:46.222 --> 1:02:48.558
YES, SIR, JUST
A FEW MORE, BUT WE
DO HAVE A BIG NIGHT.

1:02:48.724 --> 1:02:51.227
MR. MOODY HERE
SAYS YOUR FATHER
WAS A FIGHTER.

1:02:51.394 --> 1:02:52.812
YES, SIR, HE WAS.

1:02:52.979 --> 1:02:54.564
IS THAT WHY
YOU STARTED BOXING?

1:02:54.730 --> 1:02:56.732
I STARTED FIGHTING
'CAUSE WE HAD NO MONEY

1:02:56.899 --> 1:02:58.276
EXCEPT WHAT MY MOM MADE.

1:02:58.443 --> 1:02:59.735
DOES SHE APPROVE
OF YOUR FIGHTING?

1:02:59.902 --> 1:03:02.196
SHE'S DEAD. SHE DIED
WORKING TILL

1:03:02.363 --> 1:03:04.031
SHE COULDN'T
WORK NO MORE.

1:03:04.198 --> 1:03:05.450
I'M SORRY.

1:03:05.616 --> 1:03:06.993
WHY ARE YOU SORRY?

1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:10.163
SHE WAS JUST ANOTHER
NIGGER DOING WHITE
FOLKS' LAUNDRY.

1:03:10.329 --> 1:03:12.081
EASY, NOW.
EASY, NOW, SON.

1:03:12.248 --> 1:03:13.875
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PRINT THAT, SIR.

1:03:14.041 --> 1:03:16.419
YOU KNOW, WHEN A FIGHTER
GETS A LITTLE NERVOUS,
HE MIGHT SAY ANYTHING.

1:03:16.586 --> 1:03:18.212
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FATHER?
WHAT DOES HE THINK

1:03:18.379 --> 1:03:20.173
OF YOUR FOLLOWING
IN HIS FOOTSTEPS?

1:03:20.339 --> 1:03:21.799
[LAUGHS]
I DON'T KNOW.

1:03:21.966 --> 1:03:26.053
I HAVEN'T SEEN
OR HEARD FROM HIM
SINCE I WAS 8 YEARS OLD.

1:03:26.220 --> 1:03:29.140
I SEE. WELL, WHY ARE YOU
FIGHTING LIKE THIS?

1:03:29.307 --> 1:03:30.892
I MEAN,
YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL.

1:03:31.058 --> 1:03:32.894
WHY NOT BOX
IN REGULAR MATCHES?

1:03:33.060 --> 1:03:34.937
MR. MOODY'S TAKING
CARE OF ALL THAT.

1:03:35.104 --> 1:03:38.274
HE'S BRINGING
ME ALONG. I DO
WHAT HE SAYS.

1:03:38.441 --> 1:03:41.277
MATTER OF FACT,
I AM LOOKING OUT
FOR THE BOY'S WELFARE,

1:03:41.444 --> 1:03:44.030
AND AS YOU KNOW, YOU
CAN'T BRING A FIGHTER
ALONG TOO FAST.

1:03:44.197 --> 1:03:45.698
OH, COME ON, NOW,
SIR, THAT'S ENOUGH.

1:03:45.865 --> 1:03:47.783
LOOK, I TELL YOU WHAT.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TELL THE FOLKS

1:03:47.950 --> 1:03:49.785
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ON
ALL COMERS, RIGHT, BOY?

1:03:49.952 --> 1:03:51.287
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
MR. MOODY.

1:03:51.454 --> 1:03:52.622
ALL RIGHT.
I TELL YOU WHAT,

1:03:52.788 --> 1:03:54.123
WHY DON'T YOU GO ON
BACK TO THE HOTEL NOW

1:03:54.290 --> 1:03:55.416
AND GET A LITTLE REST?

1:03:55.583 --> 1:03:58.461
I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF SOME BUSINESS HERE.

1:04:07.470 --> 1:04:10.139
Moody: GENTLEMEN, GENTLEMEN,
TAKING ALL BETS RIGHT HERE.

1:04:10.306 --> 1:04:13.309
YES, SIR. GOT YOU COVERED,
