00:02.100 --> 00:03.500
<i>Torchwood</i>

00:04.100 --> 00:06.300
<i>Outside the Government,
beyond the police.</i>

00:06.900 --> 00:09.900
<i>Fighting for the future
on behalf of the human race.</i>

00:11.100 --> 00:13.900
<i>The 21st century
is when everything changes...</i>

00:14.300 --> 00:17.100
<i>and Torchwood is ready.</i>

00:25.800 --> 00:27.800
<i>Explosive devices...</i>

00:28.400 --> 00:29.400
<i>Snap!</i>

00:36.800 --> 00:38.300
<i>Jack, who's done this?</i>

00:38.335 --> 00:39.765
<i>Captain John Hart.</i>

00:39.800 --> 00:41.500
Jack, what does he want?

00:41.535 --> 00:43.200
<i>Say hi to the family.</i>

00:44.400 --> 00:45.765
No, it can't be.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.600
Been a while since you've
seen your brother, eh, Jack?

00:48.635 --> 00:50.200
Gray?

00:53.600 --> 00:54.965
That bastard John's taken our SUV.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.565
Looks like he's driven it
back to Torchwood.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.765
I'm getting readings of rift activity
all over the city.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.000
Major rift flares at St. Helen's Hospital,
the Police Headquarters

01:03.035 --> 01:05.400
and the Central IT Server Station.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.165
Hey, Andy?

01:07.200 --> 01:09.200
Gwen, you've gotta get here right now!

01:09.235 --> 01:10.565
I'm serious, we need you.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.165
Okay, I'm on my way, all right?

01:12.200 --> 01:15.000
This is him, isn't it? This Captain John,
or whatever he likes to call himself?

01:15.035 --> 01:16.365
Rhys, drop Owen at the hospital.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.000
Tosh, lanto cover the central
server building.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.817
Gwen, the police station.

01:20.852 --> 01:22.600
Then take me to Torchwood.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.800
- Think we're all gonna fit in here?
- Yeah, we're gonna have to.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.200
Jack, these are traps.

01:26.235 --> 01:26.765
So be careful.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.200
You know what he's capable of.

01:28.235 --> 01:29.165
What about you?

01:29.200 --> 01:30.500
I'm gonna go reason with him!

01:30.535 --> 01:31.765
He just tried to kill us.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.200
I was the only one who
could ever control him.

01:34.235 --> 01:35.800
That's why the Time Agency
partnered us.

01:35.835 --> 01:37.765
Did you just say Time Agency?

01:37.800 --> 01:40.400
Don't tell me that's
based in Cardiff too?

01:42.800 --> 01:45.200
<i>Why's he doing this, Jack?
What does he want?</i>

01:45.235 --> 01:47.600
<i>That's what I'm going to
go ask him.</i>

02:09.600 --> 02:13.200
Come on! Sing along!

02:13.235 --> 02:15.165
It's our song!

02:15.200 --> 02:16.565
We don't have a song.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.400
<i>And if we did have a song,
it wouldn't be this song.</i>

02:21.400 --> 02:24.000
You're no fun!

02:26.000 --> 02:27.400
Thank you.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.200
I've been here quite a while,
what kept you?

02:32.235 --> 02:34.200
We all survived.

02:34.400 --> 02:38.600
You know, if you're gonna set an
explosion, you need to be more efficient.

02:38.635 --> 02:44.200
Oh, them, they were just
prototypes, had to test out a theory.

02:45.200 --> 02:48.000
How are they all, the little team?

02:48.035 --> 02:49.965
What do you want?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.800
I want you to know that I love you.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.200
Funny way of showing it.

02:54.235 --> 02:56.365
No, seriously.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.000
You have to understand.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.400
I really do love you.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.600
Because this...

03:21.000 --> 03:22.600
is gonna get nasty.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.400
Cardiff City Police HQ 5:27PM

03:37.800 --> 03:38.365
Andy!

03:38.400 --> 03:41.400
They just appeared out of nowhere,
across the whole building.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.400
They weren't human, least not
like any human I've ever seen.

03:45.435 --> 03:46.765
The station's in shock.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.765
Four most senior officers,
murdered.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.400
Everyone's running round
like headless chickens.

03:50.435 --> 03:52.165
Rhys, what you doing here?

03:52.200 --> 03:54.500
This is a crime scene,
and a confidential crime scene at that.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.800
If what happened here gets out,
there'll be a citywide panic.

03:56.835 --> 03:57.600
Rhys won't go blabbing.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.400
I'm keeping more secrets
than you'd ever believe.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.165
Like what?

04:00.200 --> 04:01.800
Like a Time Agency.
Based in Cardiff!

04:02.000 --> 04:03.565
Oh, it's not based in Cardiff.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.600
Brilliant secret...
I ask, you tell, well done.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.765
Bloody hell. What are they?

04:13.800 --> 04:16.200
Weevils... they live in the sewers.

04:16.235 --> 04:18.165
Tell me you're joking.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.800
- Don't mind if I subdue them, do you?
- Be my guest.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.600
They killed the four
most senior officers.

04:29.635 --> 04:32.200
Almost like it was targeted.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.965
<i>Tosh, report where you are.</i>

04:35.000 --> 04:36.400
<i>Just entering the Central Server.</i>

04:36.600 --> 04:38.800
<i>No sign of rift activity yet.</i>

04:39.000 --> 04:43.800
This building houses servers
for the military, police, NHS,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.600
even looks after the server systems
for the nuclear station at Turnmill.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.917
What problem did they report?

04:49.952 --> 04:52.200
Ghosts in these server stacks.

04:52.235 --> 04:52.965
How's the arm?

04:53.000 --> 04:57.600
Owen gave me industrial strength
painkillers, seems to be doing the trick.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.200
lanto.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.165
<i>Devils! Blasphemers!</i>

05:05.200 --> 05:07.965
<i>Pray to your heathen God.</i>

05:08.000 --> 05:12.600
<i>While in the Lord's name,
we cast you out!</i>

05:22.200 --> 05:25.000
- There we are then.
- Sorted.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.200
<i>Owen, it's Gwen. Do you have
anything to report?</i>

05:29.235 --> 05:31.600
<i>We've got some activity
in the basement.</i>

05:32.400 --> 05:35.400
Coming back from a fag break,
saw the door open and there it is!

05:35.435 --> 05:37.000
Chewing through the cables.

05:37.035 --> 05:39.000
So I locked it in.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.165
What the hell is it?

05:47.200 --> 05:49.000
Short answer? It's an alien.

05:49.035 --> 05:50.317
- Alien?
- Yeah.

05:50.352 --> 05:51.565
It's called a Hoix.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.000
The only profile we have is that it
lives to eat. Doesn't matter what.

05:54.035 --> 05:56.417
Caught one in Barry last
year in a kebab shop,

05:56.452 --> 05:58.800
it went through seven
doner sticks in 20 minutes.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.400
Now, have you got the keys?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.800
- What's that?
- All species sedative.

06:03.835 --> 06:05.600
Now, food. You got anything
it can eat?

06:05.635 --> 06:06.565
Only these.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.000
Right, perfect! Wish me luck.

06:12.200 --> 06:16.165
Hoixie, where are you?

06:16.200 --> 06:19.800
Come on, porkie. Come out,
come out, wherever you are.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.400
There you are. Look what I've got.

06:23.435 --> 06:25.017
They're actually very tasty.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.600
Get a load of one of these.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.965
That's it, good boy, come to me.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.600
Come on, that's it,
try one of these.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.000
You really are quite stupid,
aren't you?

07:03.400 --> 07:06.200
Comms and weapons have been removed,
in case you were wondering.

07:06.235 --> 07:07.565
So no chance of a rescue.

07:07.600 --> 07:13.200
- This is a little extreme, don't you think?
- Oh, what? Suddenly you're anti-bondage?

07:14.600 --> 07:16.000
Why are you here?

07:16.035 --> 07:18.165
Well, see...

07:18.200 --> 07:20.765
<i>now you're interested in me.</i>

07:20.800 --> 07:24.000
It's always the same, nobody
cares until you tie them up.

07:24.035 --> 07:25.765
Number of reasons, actually.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.200
First of all, you were
very rude to me.

07:28.235 --> 07:30.600
- What?
- Very rude indeed.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.400
In front of people
who barely knew me.

07:33.435 --> 07:35.017
You belittled me.

07:35.052 --> 07:36.426
Can't let that go.

07:36.461 --> 07:37.765
You're serious?

07:37.800 --> 07:42.400
Second... you have all of time.

07:42.435 --> 07:42.820
Eternity, essentially.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.165
And you still refused
to spend time with me.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.000
After all we've been through
together, after all I've done for you.

07:49.035 --> 07:50.165
Where's Gray?

07:50.200 --> 07:53.400
What've you done with my brother?

07:55.600 --> 07:58.165
You don't realize.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.000
Actions, ramifications,
ripples in the pond.

08:01.035 --> 08:02.765
It's beyond my control.

08:02.800 --> 08:06.200
- Beyond your control? Please!
- It is.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.200
You need to understand that,

08:08.400 --> 08:11.800
so, localize the rift storms,

08:11.835 --> 08:14.117
a few short sharp shocks...

08:14.152 --> 08:16.400
Don't touch those controls!

08:16.435 --> 08:19.200
Oi, I'm working here!

08:22.200 --> 08:25.965
If you don't want that again,
keep quiet.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.800
So, I think we're ready
to find a vantage point.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.200
Whatever you're planning,
we're gonna stop you.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.200
Okay.

08:42.799 --> 08:45.600
Go on, then. Stop me.

08:46.800 --> 08:51.000
I hope you can, really.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.165
No?

08:55.200 --> 08:59.600
All right, let's go get
ourselves a good view.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.200
What the hell are we doing here?

09:07.235 --> 09:09.600
<i>This is a good view.</i>

09:16.800 --> 09:20.400
I told you, no struggling.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.000
I can make things right with you.

09:23.035 --> 09:24.365
You don't understand.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.800
You can't ever make this right.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.600
<i>Attention...
Torchwood employees!</i>

09:30.800 --> 09:32.000
<i>Evening all!</i>

09:32.200 --> 09:34.800
- Now, stop what you're doing.
- Jack, what's going on, are you okay?

09:34.835 --> 09:36.365
Jack can't come to
the comms right now.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.800
But if you leave a message,
I'll be sure and pass it along.

09:38.835 --> 09:40.517
What've you done to him?

09:40.552 --> 09:42.165
<i>No, no, wrong question.</i>

09:42.200 --> 09:46.200
You should be asking,
what am I about to do to you?

09:47.600 --> 09:49.765
- Put Jack on right now!
- Eye Candy!

09:49.800 --> 09:54.600
That was so masterful, so bossy,
so basically powerless.

09:55.800 --> 09:59.200
Get up to the roofs of your buildings.
Quickly now, spit spot.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.565
- Why?
- Owen!

10:01.600 --> 10:05.565
Cos if you don't,
you'll miss all the fun.

10:05.600 --> 10:09.400
Hold on a minute, do I mean
fun or do I mean carnage?

10:09.435 --> 10:11.317
<i>I get them confused.</i>

10:11.352 --> 10:13.276
Are you running yet?

10:13.311 --> 10:15.200
<i>No dawdling now!</i>

10:15.800 --> 10:18.200
Gwen! Where's she going?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.400
What're you doing?

10:22.600 --> 10:26.800
<i>I'm sorry.
Now... Cardiff!</i>

10:27.800 --> 10:31.600
<i>Isn't it pretty?
Doesn't it twinkle so?</i>

10:33.400 --> 10:35.400
Take a good look.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.800
<i>Remember this...
because it all goes so quick.</i>

10:48.200 --> 10:50.400
Oh, my God...

10:54.200 --> 10:56.200
Gwen?

11:04.400 --> 11:05.800
Oh, God...

11:14.200 --> 11:17.200
You've destroyed the city.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.200
Jack, hold me.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.965
Oh, my God What do we do,
what do we do?

11:24.000 --> 11:29.600
Okay, keep everyone calm, tell them
to get every officer in. RUN!

11:30.600 --> 11:31.565
What've you done?

11:31.600 --> 11:34.800
It's okay. It's all gonna be okay.

11:37.800 --> 11:41.200
Stop! Get off me!

11:44.400 --> 11:46.800
Jack? Jack?
Jack, can you hear me?

11:46.835 --> 11:47.765
Are you there? Jack!

11:47.800 --> 11:50.800
<i>I'm tracking a huge rift flare
over at the castle.</i>

11:52.200 --> 11:56.000
<i>It's been generated by the rift
manipulator at Torchwood.</i>

11:56.035 --> 11:59.400
Tosh, lanto, Owen... are you okay?

11:59.435 --> 12:00.365
Yeah, we're fine.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.500
- Still here.
- Me too.

12:02.535 --> 12:04.565
<i>Good, okay, good.</i>

12:04.600 --> 12:07.765
Tosh, do we have the scale
of the damage on the city?

12:07.800 --> 12:11.700
Fifteen major explosions,
at strategic points across the city.

12:11.735 --> 12:15.667
There's currently a surge in
traffic trying to leave the city

12:15.702 --> 12:19.565
but the explosions have cut off
all major routes in and out.

12:19.600 --> 12:24.800
Landlines, mobile phones and IT networks
all down, TV and radio off air.

12:24.835 --> 12:26.765
- He's completely crippled us, Gwen.
- Shit.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.200
Not wanting to be the harbinger
of doom, but the systems

12:29.235 --> 12:31.565
which serve the nuclear plant
have all gone off-line.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.000
<i>Tosh, lanto, you have to stabilise
the nuclear power station,</i>

12:34.200 --> 12:36.200
make that a priority.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.400
Owen, what's it like at the hospital?

12:38.435 --> 12:39.365
Lost all power.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.600
<i>The backup generators
gave out in the blast.</i>

12:41.635 --> 12:43.800
Every single machine in
this hospital is down.

12:43.835 --> 12:44.965
<i>It's a disaster.</i>

12:45.000 --> 12:47.365
Okay, all of you, listen to me.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.600
We're gonna fix this, and we're
gonna put this city back together,

12:49.635 --> 12:53.000
we're gonna find Jack
and we're gonna punish John.

12:53.035 --> 12:56.600
Now, I need you to be careful. Okay?

13:00.400 --> 13:02.800
Where are you, Jack?

13:03.800 --> 13:05.800
Where are you?

13:27.400 --> 13:28.965
We're safe.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.200
Now, before you do anything
rash, you have to hear...

13:32.235 --> 13:33.800
Take us back now!

13:33.835 --> 13:34.965
No way.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
We have to be this far to
escape the trigger signal!

13:37.035 --> 13:37.565
What?

13:37.600 --> 13:41.000
Look at it! Go on.

13:43.400 --> 13:46.400
It's bonded to my skin.
I can't get it off. Open it.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.200
Ninth generation detonator.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.800
You're a walking bomb!

13:54.600 --> 13:58.200
Add to that a surveillance circuit,
to monitor my every word and action,

13:58.235 --> 14:01.800
and he has me doing
anything I'm told.

14:01.835 --> 14:04.200
Cos if I don't... boom!

14:04.600 --> 14:06.565
I'm not my own man.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.565
I thought you'd see that.

14:07.600 --> 14:11.765
No, you're so self-obsessed you thought
I'd want to blow up the stupid city!

14:11.800 --> 14:17.800
When I could be experiencing seventeen
simultaneous pleasures in the Lotus Nebula!

14:20.400 --> 14:21.965
Oh, no. Just run.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.200
Oh, please, that is the
oldest trick in the book.

14:24.235 --> 14:26.200
<i>Jack?</i>

14:33.600 --> 14:35.400
Gray?

14:36.000 --> 14:39.200
<i>- I never stopped believing.
- Gray, where are you?</i>

14:39.800 --> 14:42.600
I always knew we'd
find each other again.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.600
I'm sorry.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.400
Sorry's not good enough.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.365
Get a shovel.

15:15.400 --> 15:20.400
This was a targeted attack,
designed to cause maximum panic.

15:20.600 --> 15:24.400
Usual emergency procedures
won't cover what's happened here.

15:24.435 --> 15:26.965
This is where we find out
how good we really are.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.600
Cover the whole city,
knock on doors, check on people,

15:30.800 --> 15:34.400
tell people that they are safe
and that it is being dealt with.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.800
Get out there and do your jobs.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
- Bloody impressive, mate.
- She is that, yeah.

15:41.035 --> 15:43.000
Lucky sod.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.800
Go!

15:47.200 --> 15:48.800
It won't work!

15:48.835 --> 15:50.365
Nothing, sorry.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.200
We need to re-start
the Turnmill servers.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.800
What if you can't?

15:55.800 --> 15:58.400
- Then the reactor goes into meltdown.
- Then I'm going up there.

15:59.000 --> 15:59.765
What? lanto!

15:59.800 --> 16:01.565
Look, if we can't fix
the remote servers,

16:01.600 --> 16:04.400
there must be something I can do
on-site to prevent nuclear meltdown.

16:04.435 --> 16:05.565
That could be suicide.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.200
Are we gonna discuss it,
or are we gonna do it?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.400
Okay, but we both go.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.365
I looked for you.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.200
I searched for you for years.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.000
You were my first thought,
every day.

16:24.035 --> 16:25.600
What are you expecting?

16:26.200 --> 16:29.800
A loving reunion? Absolution?

16:30.000 --> 16:35.600
Me to say, "It's okay, brother,
I forgive you. "

16:36.000 --> 16:38.365
<i>Take Gray and keep him safe.</i>

16:38.400 --> 16:41.400
I got to go get your mother. Run!

16:43.000 --> 16:45.800
Those creatures, they lived
to torture.

16:45.835 --> 16:48.565
<i>They kept us just on
the verge of life.</i>

16:48.600 --> 16:53.400
<i>I'd lie there, hemmed in by corpses,
praying to become one.</i>

16:53.800 --> 16:55.565
Because you...

16:55.600 --> 16:58.700
let go... of my hand, remember?

16:58.735 --> 17:01.800
If I could swap with you, I would.

17:01.835 --> 17:03.917
Gray. Gray!

17:03.952 --> 17:05.964
Where's Gray?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.800
Where is he, son?
Where is he?

17:08.835 --> 17:09.964
Gray!

17:10.000 --> 17:12.800
<i>- Remember it again.
- Gray, where are you?</i>

17:14.400 --> 17:20.200
I believed you'd come,
but you never did.

17:21.599 --> 17:24.800
How long before you gave up, hm?

17:24.835 --> 17:27.717
Months? Years? Decades?

17:27.752 --> 17:30.476
What do you want from me?

17:30.511 --> 17:33.255
I want you to suffer.

17:33.290 --> 17:36.000
I want your life.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.400
This is Cardiff.

17:39.435 --> 17:41.800
27AD.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.000
The city will be built here,
over the next 2,000 years.

17:46.035 --> 17:48.517
Your grave will be
the city's foundations.

17:48.552 --> 17:50.965
Your blessing of life
becomes a curse.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.400
Each time you revive,
with a throatful of earth,

17:56.435 --> 17:58.365
each time it chokes you afresh,

17:58.400 --> 18:02.100
and you thrash on the edge
of death, you think of me.

18:02.135 --> 18:05.800
All right, calling a halt now
I can't let you do this.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.200
- Fill the grave.
- No way.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.400
Then the detonator on
your arm gets activated.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.565
What's that?

18:32.600 --> 18:36.600
It's, er, sentimental value.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.165
Skulking, is it?

19:23.200 --> 19:24.400
Still no word from Jack.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.200
Hey, it's gonna be fine.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.200
What if it's not?

19:31.600 --> 19:33.365
What if this is how it all ends?

19:33.400 --> 19:35.800
I can't do this, Rhys.
I'm not up to it.

19:35.835 --> 19:37.400
Rubbish.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.200
Those coppers are out
there now, because of you.

19:41.235 --> 19:44.400
Even if you don't believe
in yourself, they did.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.400
And I do.

19:49.200 --> 19:52.200
You're a bloody hero, Gwen.

19:53.600 --> 19:58.000
So you keep going,
cos we need you.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.200
Will you marry me again?

20:06.000 --> 20:09.165
Gwen, I've got a rift alert
from inside the Hub,

20:09.200 --> 20:11.400
mirroring the pattern from earlier
when Jack disappeared.

20:11.435 --> 20:12.765
D'you think it could be him?

20:12.800 --> 20:16.400
I can't check it out, I've got to get
the Turnmill servers back online.

20:16.435 --> 20:18.200
Tosh, I can't leave the police station.

20:18.235 --> 20:19.917
Yes, you can.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.376
If they need you.

20:21.411 --> 20:23.105
We'll be fine.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.800
Are you sure?

20:25.400 --> 20:27.800
I'll see you when it's all over.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.200
Go!

21:04.200 --> 21:06.000
You took your time.

21:06.035 --> 21:07.800
On your knees!

21:08.200 --> 21:10.800
Honestly, it's just
sex, sex, sex with you people!

21:10.835 --> 21:12.600
Now!

21:15.000 --> 21:17.400
Hands behind your head!

21:18.200 --> 21:21.800
I'm gonna need a really good reason not
to shoot you within the next 20 seconds.

21:21.835 --> 21:23.800
I know where Jack is.

21:23.835 --> 21:24.765
You're lying.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.000
He's buried alive,
somewhere beneath this city.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.017
I came back to help you.

21:28.052 --> 21:29.000
You bombed this city!

21:29.035 --> 21:30.765
Listen to me!

21:30.800 --> 21:32.165
You have to believe me.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.200
It's Gray, Jack's brother,
that's been doing all this.

21:35.235 --> 21:36.565
Don't talk rubbish.

21:36.600 --> 21:41.600
He placed a bomb on me, molecularly
bonded the detonator to my skin,

21:41.635 --> 21:45.400
I had to do what he wanted. Look!

21:46.200 --> 21:49.000
He forced me to bury Jack
and then he freed me,

21:49.035 --> 21:51.965
he told me I could go
anywhere I wanted.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.400
I could've run, but I chose
to come back here.

21:57.600 --> 22:00.200
Why should I trust you?

22:01.800 --> 22:04.000
They were separated as children.

22:04.035 --> 22:05.565
Gray was abducted.

22:05.600 --> 22:10.000
When I found him he was chained
to the ruins of a city

22:10.200 --> 22:15.200
in the Bedlam Outlands...
surrounded by corpses.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.765
He was the only one left.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.500
The creatures had long since gone.

22:21.535 --> 22:24.200
Dunno how long he'd been there.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
He thought I was the rescuing hero.

22:29.800 --> 22:33.200
So, it took me too long to realize

22:33.600 --> 22:38.000
he'd learned terrible things
watching those creatures.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.200
He let me trust him...

22:43.400 --> 22:46.200
The molecules are unbonding.

22:46.235 --> 22:50.000
Just like he promised.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.400
Oh, God.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.200
See? Free man. Apparently.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.600
I didn't have to come back here.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.200
I could've run.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.100
You find Jack, I'll let you live.

23:14.135 --> 23:16.000
- But you'd better be quick.
- Fine.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.200
Toshiko.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.600
<i>I need you to run a trace for
an etheric particle signal NME</i>

23:25.635 --> 23:27.800
<i>transmitting at 200 betacycles.</i>

23:27.835 --> 23:29.565
Gwen, where are you?

23:29.600 --> 23:31.400
What's he doing? Where's Jack?

23:31.435 --> 23:33.200
Trace that signal, we'll find him.

23:33.235 --> 23:34.365
It's okay, Tosh.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.600
I've got him covered.
Just do as he says.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.600
No signals even vaguely
resembling that.

23:39.635 --> 23:40.165
There must be.

23:40.200 --> 23:44.200
That transmitter's guaranteed for five
millennia through three permalayers,

23:44.235 --> 23:45.400
it has to still be transmitting.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.200
<i>If not, we'll never find him.</i>

23:48.235 --> 23:50.800
<i>He'll be buried... forever.</i>

23:54.500 --> 23:56.500
What the hell is that?

24:17.700 --> 24:20.300
Oh, there's weevils loose
in the lower corridors.

24:20.900 --> 24:23.100
Stay there, stay there.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.300
Oh, my God, what's going on,
how did they get out?

24:26.700 --> 24:28.465
It's Gray.

24:28.500 --> 24:32.300
He must be here in the city,
he said he was gonna take Jack's life,

24:32.335 --> 24:34.465
destroy it from the inside out.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.300
A weevil wake-up call
could be just the beginning.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.265
Owen, Gwen, can you hear me?

24:47.300 --> 24:50.500
The streets are flooded with weevils,
they came out of nowhere.

24:51.100 --> 24:54.700
There's no chance we'll get to
the nuclear power station in time.

24:54.735 --> 24:57.100
Manual life support,
get them round the hospital.

24:57.135 --> 24:59.617
lanto, leave it to me.

24:59.652 --> 25:02.100
- I can get there.
- How?

25:02.700 --> 25:05.100
King of the Weevils, remember?

25:19.100 --> 25:22.100
Push, will you! Have none
of you ever been in a scrum!

25:28.700 --> 25:31.100
Bloody hell, how many were there?

25:31.135 --> 25:33.465
It's like Fort Apache the Bronx.

25:33.500 --> 25:36.300
Apart from the fact that there are
savage aliens and we could all die,

25:36.335 --> 25:37.700
it's almost exactly the same, yeah.

25:37.735 --> 25:39.500
Thanks for that.

25:42.700 --> 25:45.100
I am telling you I have
run every scan possible,

25:45.135 --> 25:46.300
there is no signal traceable.

25:46.500 --> 25:49.100
Then try it again, it's got to be there.

25:49.135 --> 25:51.500
Oi, I'm talking to you.

26:00.300 --> 26:03.300
You know you've got a real
pest problem around here.

26:06.300 --> 26:08.500
Oh, God, I'm so pleased
to see you!

26:10.100 --> 26:12.265
Don't start, I'll make
things right, Eye Candy.

26:12.300 --> 26:15.500
Then start by getting those Weevils
down the vaults before they recover.

26:15.535 --> 26:18.100
It takes more than
a bullet to stop them.

26:19.900 --> 26:20.465
- You did what?
- lanto!

26:20.500 --> 26:22.665
- I didn't have a choice!
- There's always a choice.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.900
Okay, can we just get these
Weevils into the cells, please!

26:24.935 --> 26:27.900
If we don't find him, I'll kill you.

26:28.300 --> 26:30.700
Very slowly.

26:31.900 --> 26:33.865
What's happening? Tosh?

26:33.900 --> 26:35.900
Tosh! lanto, my comms are dead.

26:35.935 --> 26:38.100
Gwen?

26:39.300 --> 26:41.465
I let you go.

26:41.500 --> 26:45.100
I gave you one trip,
you could have gone anywhere.

26:45.135 --> 26:47.100
Question of honour.

26:47.135 --> 26:49.300
<i>Gray?</i>

26:50.900 --> 26:52.865
You're Gray, right?

26:52.900 --> 26:54.100
There's no need for this,
we can help you.

26:54.135 --> 26:55.900
Just tell us where Jack is.

26:55.935 --> 26:58.300
His life's mine now.

27:00.900 --> 27:02.265
Where's Jack?

27:02.300 --> 27:04.200
What've you done with him?

27:04.235 --> 27:06.100
What've you done with him?!

27:13.300 --> 27:14.600
What the hell are you doing?
Get the hell out of here!

27:14.635 --> 27:15.900
What the hell are you doing here,
is more like it!

27:16.100 --> 27:17.300
The systems going into meltdown.

27:17.500 --> 27:18.700
A soldier never leaves her post.

27:18.735 --> 27:20.065
Well you can now, okay?

27:20.100 --> 27:21.665
I'm with Torchwood and
we're dealing with this.

27:21.700 --> 27:24.465
Yeah? What d'you know about
nuclear containment structure?

27:24.500 --> 27:27.700
Well, I'm only a lineman, but I'm
presuming if you've run out of power,

27:27.735 --> 27:29.900
then the containment structure
is over pressurised.

27:29.935 --> 27:31.665
The containment spray
and cooling systems

27:31.700 --> 27:34.500
aren't working so the fuel
probably can't be cooled down,

27:34.535 --> 27:35.465
it's overheating.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.665
So sooner rather than later,
there'll be a meltdown

27:37.700 --> 27:40.900
and radioactive material will be
released into the atmosphere. Yeah?

27:40.935 --> 27:43.017
- Roughly?
- Roughly.

27:43.052 --> 27:45.100
Right. You need to go.

27:45.700 --> 27:47.900
Be careful. There are creatures
are there who are lose.

27:47.935 --> 27:49.500
Take this. It's a kind of maze.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.100
It sounds more dangerous
out there than in here.

27:52.135 --> 27:54.500
Yeah, I'd say it's
pretty much even. Go.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.300
Thank you.

28:03.300 --> 28:05.100
Tosh, you're going to have to
help me out here.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.700
I haven't got a bloody clue
of what I'm doing.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.300
<i>Okay...
I don't want you to panic,</i>

28:12.500 --> 28:15.100
but the reactor has already
hit the critical point.

28:15.300 --> 28:18.000
Okay, you're telling me it's
gone into meltdown, aren't you?

28:18.100 --> 28:19.300
And I'm at the eye of the storm.

28:19.335 --> 28:20.700
Yeah, sorry.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.900
Right. Can you fix it?

28:23.300 --> 28:25.900
- Of course I can, I'm brilliant!
- Yeah.

28:26.300 --> 28:30.300
<i>I'm going to try and divert power
from an auxiliary source back to Turnmill.</i>

28:30.700 --> 28:35.600
If that works, I can talk you through
restoring the coolant system.

28:36.100 --> 28:37.500
Right, now...

28:38.900 --> 28:39.900
Tosh!

29:02.300 --> 29:03.100
Help me...

29:04.900 --> 29:05.500
please.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.900
Tosh? Are you there?

29:11.500 --> 29:13.900
I've heard people say,
death is such a waste.

29:17.900 --> 29:19.700
I imagine it more as a relief.

29:20.700 --> 29:22.500
<i>Tosh, do you hear me?
Tosh!</i>

29:22.900 --> 29:24.900
What's it like? How does it feel?

29:26.900 --> 29:29.500
Are you afraid? Are you sad?

29:30.300 --> 29:33.500
<i>You can tell me.
The battle is done.</i>

29:38.300 --> 29:39.700
What's that?

29:54.100 --> 29:56.100
Tosh, talk to me!
I need you help here, babe!

30:04.700 --> 30:06.100
- What's that banging?
- Something's wrong.

30:06.135 --> 30:07.900
Nevermind that, I have an idea.

30:54.300 --> 30:55.100
I forgive you.

30:56.900 --> 30:57.900
How did you survive?

30:59.700 --> 31:01.700
How long since you first discovered it?

31:01.735 --> 31:02.500
3 days now.

31:02.700 --> 31:05.300
Just one signal,
regular as clockwork.

31:05.900 --> 31:11.100
But I haven't told you the best bit,
I can track it to a physical location.

31:11.500 --> 31:12.300
Where?

31:15.700 --> 31:18.500
It's here. 20 feet down,
but it's definitely here.

31:18.700 --> 31:19.700
Start digging.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.500
Please, can we just stop
with the questions?

31:23.900 --> 31:26.065
We found you in a 20-foot grave.

31:26.100 --> 31:28.100
- Do you want us to just accept that?
- Yes, I do.

31:28.300 --> 31:30.500
You supposed to be out there
working for us.

31:30.700 --> 31:31.700
Who gave you this ring?

31:33.100 --> 31:34.700
I have crossed my own timeline.

31:35.300 --> 31:39.700
I can't be allowed to meet myself,
a lot of lives depend on this.

31:39.735 --> 31:41.700
You'll be protecting the future.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.500
That's what you're here for,
isn't it?

31:44.500 --> 31:46.465
And now I need you to
put me in the morgue.

31:46.500 --> 31:50.900
Freeze me, set the alarm to
defrost in 107 years time.

31:53.100 --> 31:54.100
I forgive you, Gray.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.300
Don't you walk away from me.

31:59.100 --> 32:00.900
Don't you walk away from me!

32:04.500 --> 32:06.900
Stop... stop!

32:07.700 --> 32:10.900
I've forgiven you!
I give you absolution.

32:11.300 --> 32:15.300
- Now do the same for me!
- I pray for death!

32:15.700 --> 32:20.900
Those creatures, the things
they did to us, because if you...

32:21.500 --> 32:26.700
the favourite son. The one
who lived, who'll always live.

32:27.700 --> 32:31.900
The only strength I have,
is my hatred for you.

32:36.100 --> 32:37.500
I didn't know.

32:37.900 --> 32:40.100
I didn't realize
until it was too late.

32:40.135 --> 32:43.300
I begrudge you everything.

32:44.100 --> 32:49.900
I want to rip it all from you,
to leave you screaming in the dark.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.900
I will never resolve you.

32:54.100 --> 32:55.900
All of it, it's your fault.

33:21.100 --> 33:21.900
I know.

33:23.700 --> 33:24.500
I know, Gray.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.100
Got it.

33:33.100 --> 33:34.700
- Sorry.
- What've you done?

33:34.900 --> 33:36.500
Recall signal.

33:36.900 --> 33:38.500
Time for all the pests
to return home.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.300
What happend?
Where've they all gone?

33:50.100 --> 33:51.300
Abergavenny?

33:53.100 --> 33:55.900
Tosh! Come on, girl.

34:02.100 --> 34:02.900
Here we go!

34:03.100 --> 34:04.500
All right, you've done it, Tosh.
We've got power.

34:05.900 --> 34:08.500
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

34:08.699 --> 34:09.900
Right, what's going on there?

34:11.900 --> 34:15.300
Just a... machine malfunction.

34:16.100 --> 34:19.100
- Are you hurt?
- Who me? No.

34:19.900 --> 34:22.500
- I'm fine. It's just my arm.
- Okay.

34:23.300 --> 34:25.300
<i>- I'm sortin' out another painkiller.
- Good.</i>

34:33.300 --> 34:33.900
Okay.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.500
Come on, let's do this thing.

34:46.100 --> 34:47.900
- Owen...
- What is it, love?

34:48.100 --> 34:50.300
There's no way
to stop the meltdown.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.100
<i>It's too far gone.</i>

34:53.100 --> 34:54.900
Okay, that is not good, is it?

34:55.300 --> 34:58.500
But some on, Tosh. There's got to be
something, there's allways something.

34:58.700 --> 35:02.900
The only option now is to vent
the flow channels internally.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.300
Vent them where?

35:04.700 --> 35:08.300
The area you are in,
there's a containment building.

35:08.500 --> 35:08.900
Yeah.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.900
<i>Well, instead of
the redundancy program</i>

35:12.100 --> 35:16.900
channel the fuel into that bunker
and instigate permanent lockdown.

35:18.100 --> 35:22.100
Seal the building and the
meltdown will be contained within.

35:23.100 --> 35:24.600
<i>And obviously,
remember to get out.</i>

35:24.700 --> 35:27.000
Yeah, I think
I can remember that bit.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.100
I'll open the system protocol.

35:30.900 --> 35:34.500
You just need to enter
the timeframe and authorize it.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.300
Okay, Tosh. Let's do this thing.

35:38.900 --> 35:40.700
<i>And, er, Tosh...</i>

35:41.700 --> 35:42.700
thank you.

35:44.700 --> 35:46.300
That's what I'm here for.

35:59.100 --> 35:59.700
Jack!

36:02.900 --> 36:03.900
Thank, God!

36:04.700 --> 36:08.100
- We thought we lost you.
- Never... never.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.900
Quite a que for the hugs.

36:10.100 --> 36:12.100
Always has been, always will be.

36:13.900 --> 36:17.100
Nice use of the ring. Thank you.

36:17.500 --> 36:18.700
It's the least I could do.

36:19.100 --> 36:21.300
- Listen, Gray is in the Hub.
- I know.

36:22.100 --> 36:23.500
It's done.

36:29.300 --> 36:30.500
Yes! Rock'n'roll!

36:34.100 --> 36:36.900
Owen...
Owen, get out of there!

36:37.700 --> 36:39.900
There's a power surge
in the system!

36:40.700 --> 36:43.700
When that hits, it'll trigger
an emergency lockdown!

36:52.300 --> 36:56.300
No! Tosh!
Toshiko, I can't get out!

36:58.900 --> 37:00.300
Not like this!

37:02.500 --> 37:03.900
I'm not dying here!

37:04.500 --> 37:06.300
<i>Get me out of here, Tosh!</i>

37:06.335 --> 37:07.065
Get me out of here!

37:07.100 --> 37:09.500
I've died once,
I'm not doing it again!

37:09.535 --> 37:10.865
Where's Jack?

37:10.900 --> 37:12.465
Where's Gwen, lanto, John?

37:12.500 --> 37:14.665
You want to watch
the dead man die again?!

37:14.700 --> 37:17.900
- Owen, just stay calm.
- Oh, why should I do that?

37:17.935 --> 37:19.265
Where's the fun in that?!

37:19.300 --> 37:22.300
I'm gonna rage
my way to oblivion.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.665
- Please stop.
- Why?

37:24.700 --> 37:27.065
Give me one good
bloody reason why!

37:27.100 --> 37:29.700
One good reason why
I shouldn't keep screaming!

37:29.900 --> 37:33.100
Because you're breaking my heart.

37:46.900 --> 37:51.300
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

37:52.300 --> 37:56.300
No, no, no, it isn't.
No, it isn't, love.

37:56.335 --> 37:59.300
Don't you dare go there, Tosh.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.900
I'm really sorry.

38:05.300 --> 38:07.900
What's gonna happen to me, Tosh?

38:09.300 --> 38:11.265
I can't...

38:11.300 --> 38:14.900
Please. Okay, I need to know.

38:23.700 --> 38:28.700
The containment chamber will be
flooded with the irradiated coolant.

38:29.700 --> 38:35.900
Ah, my body will slowly
decompose, as I watch.

38:37.500 --> 38:40.700
- I should've been able to stop it.
- Shh.

38:41.500 --> 38:44.065
Come on, Tosh.

38:44.100 --> 38:48.100
There's no way you could've
anticipated that power spike, come on.

38:50.300 --> 38:54.700
Besides, you've saved my back
so many times in the past.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.500
Right from the moment I joined.

39:01.100 --> 39:06.100
Your second week
I had to cover for you,

39:07.700 --> 39:13.100
pretend I was a medic, cos you
were hung over and unreachable.

39:16.100 --> 39:18.400
What was it, Space Pig?

39:18.435 --> 39:20.700
- Space Pig.
- Yeah.

39:24.900 --> 39:29.100
We never did get that date,
did we, you and me?

39:32.500 --> 39:36.500
We sort of, er,
missed each other.

39:38.500 --> 39:42.100
It was my fault. I didn't...

39:42.500 --> 39:45.500
notice until it was too late.

39:47.900 --> 39:50.300
I'm sorry.

39:53.100 --> 39:55.300
Me too.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.100
It's starting.

40:08.300 --> 40:10.500
Owen...

40:13.500 --> 40:15.900
It's all right.

40:17.300 --> 40:20.100
Really, Tosh.

40:20.900 --> 40:23.700
It's all right.

40:28.500 --> 40:30.300
Oh, God.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.700
Owen...

40:38.500 --> 40:39.900
<i>Owen...</i>

40:50.300 --> 40:53.265
Toshiko? Toshiko?

40:53.300 --> 40:56.100
Gwen, I need help down here!

41:01.900 --> 41:04.900
The nuclear plant at Turnmill.
Owen's there.

41:04.935 --> 41:06.265
Sealed in.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.700
I re-routed the blast.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.500
Couldn't save him.

41:14.700 --> 41:17.900
Tosh? There you go, darling.

41:21.500 --> 41:24.500
Talk to me now, come on.
Hey, Tosh!

42:19.700 --> 42:22.100
<i>And Cardiff city centre
is today recovering</i>

42:22.300 --> 42:25.265
<i>from a series
of devastating explosions.</i>

42:25.300 --> 42:27.300
<i>City leaders say
it's too early to account</i>

42:27.500 --> 42:29.265
<i>for the full scale of the damage</i>

42:29.300 --> 42:31.700
<i>that also saw sightings
of vicious animals</i>

42:31.900 --> 42:34.100
<i>on the streets of the city.</i>

42:41.700 --> 42:43.800
My whole life I was looking for him.

42:43.835 --> 42:45.667
Now I have to lose him all over again.

42:45.702 --> 42:47.465
You cryo-freeze him and then what?

42:47.500 --> 42:50.100
Wake him up in a 100 years
and he's miraculously better?

42:50.135 --> 42:52.465
Cos that's not gonna happen.

42:52.500 --> 42:55.500
Maybe killing him
would be the release he needs.

42:55.535 --> 42:58.700
There has been enough death.

43:01.100 --> 43:03.200
You didn't struggle...

43:03.235 --> 43:05.265
when I buried you.

43:05.300 --> 43:08.900
Like... you were allowing it.

43:08.935 --> 43:11.700
It was my penance.

43:14.900 --> 43:17.900
It's not your fault.

43:58.900 --> 44:01.100
Need help with those rift predictions?

44:01.135 --> 44:03.265
Lot of this planet I haven't seen.

44:03.300 --> 44:05.500
You like it so much,
thought I might take a look.

44:05.535 --> 44:07.700
Maybe see you around.

44:12.500 --> 44:16.100
I'm sorry for your losses.

45:47.100 --> 45:49.900
<i>Okay. So...</i>

45:50.300 --> 45:55.100
<i>if you're seeing this, I guess
it means, I'm... well, dead.</i>

45:55.900 --> 45:57.665
<i>Hope it was impressive!</i>

45:57.700 --> 46:00.900
<i>Not crossing the road or
an incident with a toaster.</i>

46:02.300 --> 46:04.700
<i>I just wanted to say...</i>

46:04.735 --> 46:06.700
<i>it's okay.</i>

46:06.900 --> 46:09.300
<i>It really is.</i>

46:09.900 --> 46:13.500
<i>Jack, you saved me.</i>

46:14.100 --> 46:17.700
<i>You showed me all the wonders
of the universe and...</i>

46:17.735 --> 46:20.265
<i>all those possibilities.</i>

46:20.300 --> 46:23.100
<i>And I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.</i>

46:23.700 --> 46:25.700
<i>Thank you.</i>

46:26.700 --> 46:31.100
<i>And Owen, you never knew...</i>

46:34.700 --> 46:38.300
<i>I love you. All of you.</i>

46:38.900 --> 46:41.300
<i>And...</i>

46:41.500 --> 46:44.500
<i>I hope I did good.</i>

46:54.700 --> 46:57.500
Now we carry on.

47:01.500 --> 47:04.500
I don't think I can, not after this.

47:08.100 --> 47:10.100
You can.

47:12.100 --> 47:14.500
We all can.

47:16.900 --> 47:19.100
The end is where we start from.
