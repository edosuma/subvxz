00:12.826 --> 00:15.565
<i>Previously on</i> Class of '09...

00:15.565 --> 00:17.669
Tayo, did you self-test?

00:17.669 --> 00:19.640
Yes, sir, I did.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.276
And you passed?

00:21.276 --> 00:23.080
Yes, ma'am.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.248
Well, you haven't
passed it here.

00:24.248 --> 00:25.552
I don't care

00:25.552 --> 00:27.154
whether you like each other
or not.

00:27.154 --> 00:28.858
These are the people
who'll be by your side

00:28.858 --> 00:30.327
when you're under fire.

00:30.327 --> 00:32.098
Now they're watching me.

00:32.098 --> 00:34.536
You should talk to Hour.
She's the only one

00:34.536 --> 00:36.138
who ever understood the code.

00:39.746 --> 00:41.550
<i>Why are you here?</i>

00:41.550 --> 00:43.453
We were just hoping that
we could talk a bit.

00:43.453 --> 00:47.261
I read that
J. Edgar Hoover used to exile

00:47.261 --> 00:49.700
out-of-favor agents
to Butte and Billings.

00:49.700 --> 00:51.871
Did you do something wrong,
Agent Michaels?

01:10.541 --> 01:11.743
The basement.

01:36.492 --> 01:39.398
Did we stop something?

01:41.837 --> 01:43.406
Or start it?

01:53.326 --> 01:56.399
If you get scared, just
raise your hand and I'll stop.

02:10.561 --> 02:13.568
The car and the Bureau
grew up together.

02:13.568 --> 02:17.441
The Bureau Of Investigation
was founded in 1908.

02:17.441 --> 02:20.715
That same year,
Henry Ford began mass production

02:20.715 --> 02:22.385
of the Model T automobile

02:22.385 --> 02:24.589
at the Piquette Avenue Plant
in Detroit.

02:25.390 --> 02:28.531
<i>For the first time
ordinary American families</i>

02:28.531 --> 02:29.867
<i>could afford their own car.</i>

02:29.867 --> 02:31.637
<i>For the first time</i>

02:31.637 --> 02:34.375
ordinary American criminals
could, too.

02:34.375 --> 02:39.285
What would the Bureau
have become without the car?

02:39.285 --> 02:41.288
Would it have become
anything at all?

02:45.464 --> 02:48.336
<i>AGENT (over P.A.): Track
is clear for spin maneuver.</i>

02:48.336 --> 02:49.807
Okay.

02:49.807 --> 02:51.643
Here we go.

03:04.870 --> 03:06.573
You're too high-strung.

03:13.286 --> 03:15.390
Come on, come on.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.267
You've got some fight.
I like that.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.739
But to do a J-turn,
you've got to lose control.

03:37.936 --> 03:40.808
- Yes!
- Yeah!

04:20.821 --> 04:23.995
<i>MAN Entry team comms, priority one.</i>

04:28.036 --> 04:30.608
We've got line of sight
on both sides of the building.

04:30.608 --> 04:33.681
He was at Two Bricks Ranch.
We've got him surrounded.

04:33.681 --> 04:36.352
He wants to negotiate.

04:36.352 --> 04:39.291
<i>Breach team,
moving into position now.</i>

04:50.046 --> 04:52.083
Positions!

05:07.715 --> 05:11.055
<i>Alpha, Bravo Team's in position.</i>

05:11.055 --> 05:12.726
No one fire. Hey!

05:12.726 --> 05:15.096
<i>Heads up, got one walking in.</i>

05:20.741 --> 05:21.977
Breach!

05:23.480 --> 05:25.852
FBI! Keep your hands in the air!

05:27.388 --> 05:29.626
Where is Mark Tupirik?

05:29.626 --> 05:32.798
You got no idea what's coming.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.606
<i>Warning.</i>

05:52.606 --> 05:55.376
<i>Magnetic interference detected.</i>

05:56.780 --> 06:00.153
<i>Warning.

06:00.153 --> 06:02.057
<i>Warning.</i>

06:02.057 --> 06:05.396
<i>Magnetic interference detected.</i>

07:22.618 --> 07:24.221
Mama!

07:24.221 --> 07:26.559
I want you to meet my family.

07:38.216 --> 07:39.953
Hi, I'm Poet.

07:39.953 --> 07:41.956
I know who you are.

07:42.959 --> 07:44.629
This is Sara.

07:44.629 --> 07:45.998
Hello there.

07:45.998 --> 07:48.069
Why do you look so sad?

07:48.069 --> 07:52.812
I-I'm not sad. I'm happy.

07:53.881 --> 07:55.918
Are you my mom's friend?

07:58.289 --> 08:00.994
She was my best friend.

08:11.048 --> 08:12.986
I need your help.

08:12.986 --> 08:15.023
My help?

08:15.023 --> 08:17.629
You were right.

08:17.629 --> 08:19.265
I was wrong.

08:19.265 --> 08:21.035
- What were you wrong about?
- All of it.

08:21.035 --> 08:23.006
They stole your system.

08:23.006 --> 08:24.776
They turned it
into something terrible.

08:24.776 --> 08:26.279
I told you this would happen.

08:26.279 --> 08:27.916
I didn't have a choice.
It wasn't my call--

08:27.916 --> 08:29.553
You did have a choice.
You could've trusted me.

08:29.553 --> 08:31.790
It's not a prediction anymore.

08:31.790 --> 08:33.994
Okay? It's reality.
It's happening now.

08:33.994 --> 08:35.698
What is happening?

08:37.602 --> 08:40.608
- Amos Garcia is dead.
- Good!

08:40.608 --> 08:42.645
Let him rot.

08:42.645 --> 08:43.981
He stole my fucking system.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.884
You sided with him.

08:49.191 --> 08:51.830
I was there when he was shot.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.934
He gave me something.

08:54.869 --> 08:56.740
Something that I need your help

08:56.740 --> 08:58.744
understanding.

09:01.282 --> 09:05.691
The system has expanded into
every part of our lives.

09:05.691 --> 09:07.996
I begged you to help me.

09:07.996 --> 09:09.833
I've never asked you
for anything.

09:09.833 --> 09:11.904
And I begged you.

09:11.904 --> 09:14.642
And you turned your back on me.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.118
I know you, Poet.

09:19.118 --> 09:20.955
I know it would've been

09:20.955 --> 09:22.992
too intimate for you if...

09:24.963 --> 09:26.365
...if you had sided with me

09:26.365 --> 09:28.202
after I told you
that I was in love with you.

09:42.698 --> 09:45.170
Well...

09:45.170 --> 09:47.240
here we are.

09:51.015 --> 09:53.086
Here I am.

09:53.086 --> 09:55.691
Humiliated, alone.

09:56.993 --> 09:58.931
I lost the Bureau,
I lost my best friend.

09:58.931 --> 10:02.639
And I can't change any of it,
but I can try.

10:02.639 --> 10:05.844
I can try and make this right.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.024
vator bell dings)

11:01.388 --> 11:04.194
We call it "Better Tomorrow."

11:11.408 --> 11:13.847
<i>What does a better
tomorrow look like to you?</i>

11:13.847 --> 11:17.154
It's a world
where nothing bad gets missed.

11:17.154 --> 11:20.327
And no piece of evidence is
ever overlooked.

11:20.327 --> 11:22.197
I like the sound of that.

11:22.197 --> 11:24.401
Don't you think it's crazy

11:24.401 --> 11:27.040
that after 20 years,
they kick us out

11:27.040 --> 11:29.411
- just as we're getting smart?
- Yeah, I do.

11:29.411 --> 11:31.850
All that time
we devote to learning.

11:31.850 --> 11:34.221
Now what if all
that life experience,

11:34.221 --> 11:35.992
all that wisdom,

11:35.992 --> 11:37.427
was held here?

11:38.864 --> 11:41.134
That's how you see this?

11:42.505 --> 11:44.308
When the Bureau
was investigating

11:44.308 --> 11:46.178
the Unabomber case,
they introduced

11:46.178 --> 11:48.049
the Z Index computer system.

11:48.049 --> 11:49.451
Do you remember that?

11:49.451 --> 11:52.357
Nobody remembers
the Z Index system.

11:52.357 --> 11:54.929
It was one
of the first computer systems

11:54.929 --> 11:56.499
the Bureau ever used.

11:56.499 --> 11:59.204
Held all 11 million
Unabomber case documents.

11:59.204 --> 12:02.077
- 84 million names.
- Hmm.

12:02.077 --> 12:04.849
So agents didn't have to search
through stacks of boxes anymore.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.154
The Bureau changed overnight.

12:07.154 --> 12:09.024
This is more than just
a filing system.

12:09.024 --> 12:11.262
It's a library
of special agents.

12:11.262 --> 12:12.899
It's the best of you.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.869
It's the best of me.

12:16.906 --> 12:18.442
It's the dream.

12:21.215 --> 12:23.854
It's the dream.

12:23.854 --> 12:25.858
<i>I don't understand</i>

12:25.858 --> 12:27.260
why the Bureau would say no.

12:27.260 --> 12:30.066
Adopting this technology
would mean entire

12:30.066 --> 12:32.404
investigations don't depend
on one agent's

12:32.404 --> 12:35.176
judgment... or their memory.

12:35.176 --> 12:37.314
You could play back
any interview.

12:37.314 --> 12:38.951
Reference any case.

12:38.951 --> 12:40.487
Even if you're in the field.

12:40.487 --> 12:43.225
It's a guardrail
against bias and error.

12:44.494 --> 12:46.132
Okay.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.069
Why do you think
Hour is so fixated

12:48.069 --> 12:49.839
on the Bureau's technology?

12:49.839 --> 12:51.543
I just told you why.

12:51.543 --> 12:53.881
Motivations...

12:53.881 --> 12:56.018
...can be complicated.

12:57.487 --> 12:58.924
Where are you going with this?

13:13.587 --> 13:15.925
This isn't the 1960s.

13:15.925 --> 13:18.162
- It's not a judgment.
- It certainly looks like one.

13:18.162 --> 13:19.397
It's an insight.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.939
What would Hour's tech
say about her?

13:22.939 --> 13:25.310
It would say
that she cares deeply

13:25.310 --> 13:27.347
about fairness and justice.

13:27.347 --> 13:29.184
Or that she trusts technology

13:29.184 --> 13:30.521
more than she trusts people.

13:30.521 --> 13:32.892
May-Maybe she

13:32.892 --> 13:35.130
wants to create a fairer world

13:35.130 --> 13:37.234
for others than that world
has-has been for her.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.904
That sounds great to me.
What does...

13:38.904 --> 13:40.608
what does it matter
if that's her motivation?

13:40.608 --> 13:42.377
It's deeply personal.

13:42.377 --> 13:44.148
This isn't just a proposal.

13:44.148 --> 13:45.450
It's, it's...

13:45.450 --> 13:47.254
it's rooted in her identity.

13:47.254 --> 13:49.291
When ideas go that deep,

13:49.291 --> 13:51.262
it's hard to let it go.

13:51.262 --> 13:54.134
If she can't reform
the Bureau, she...

13:54.134 --> 13:56.205
she might feel a kind of trauma

13:56.205 --> 13:58.309
that goes deeper than rejection.

13:58.309 --> 14:01.082
It's happened before, Poet.

14:01.082 --> 14:02.885
I know you know the names,
I don't need to name them.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.123
You didn't want me
to report back on her tech.

14:05.123 --> 14:07.294
You wanted me to manage

14:07.294 --> 14:09.198
her emotions
if you shut her down.

14:09.198 --> 14:10.534
She knows

14:10.534 --> 14:12.471
all of the secrets, Poet.

14:12.471 --> 14:14.542
She spent ten years
collecting them.

14:14.542 --> 14:17.380
You know what's
funny, the Bureau claims

14:17.380 --> 14:20.019
to want different types
of people

14:20.019 --> 14:21.623
with different experiences

14:21.623 --> 14:23.694
so long as we all do
the same fucking thing.

14:23.694 --> 14:26.165
This institution isn't
a blank page, Poet.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.870
I don't get to rewrite it,
nor does anyone else.

14:34.114 --> 14:36.352
In 1985, the Bureau pioneered

14:36.352 --> 14:39.391
the Violent Criminal
Apprehension Program.

14:39.391 --> 14:41.462
ViCAP started on a system called

14:41.462 --> 14:44.234
the Vax 11/785.

14:44.234 --> 14:46.438
- It was the size of this room.
- Agent Nazari,

14:46.438 --> 14:49.211
today's hearing isn't
about programs from the past--

14:49.211 --> 14:51.683
The past is at the heart
of what we're talking about.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.419
It's about holding on
to knowledge,

14:53.419 --> 14:55.222
rather than letting it
slip away.

14:57.093 --> 14:59.131
A central repository

14:59.131 --> 15:01.168
of every criminal investigation,

15:01.168 --> 15:03.974
accessible by every agent
in every part of the country.

15:03.974 --> 15:06.479
It was a brilliant idea in 1985.

15:06.479 --> 15:09.251
And we betrayed it then.

15:09.251 --> 15:11.288
We can't betray it again.

15:12.057 --> 15:14.361
Every person in this room
could name

15:14.361 --> 15:16.533
at least one victim
who would still be alive today

15:16.533 --> 15:18.604
if law enforcement had
connected the dots.

15:18.604 --> 15:20.708
You can appreciate
how our agents

15:20.708 --> 15:22.177
don't want to be spied on?

15:22.177 --> 15:24.516
I can appreciate that, yes.

15:24.516 --> 15:26.987
You-you would make spying
a matter of-of what?

15:26.987 --> 15:28.557
Routine? Every conversation?

15:28.557 --> 15:30.326
Well, no, that's,
that's an unfair character--

15:30.326 --> 15:33.199
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but
we predicted this would create

15:33.199 --> 15:36.205
a recruitment crisis of the kind
the Bureau's never seen.

15:36.205 --> 15:38.242
We can't be
so scared of technology

15:38.242 --> 15:41.015
treading on our toes
that we render it useless.

15:41.015 --> 15:44.188
Today ViCAP holds
less than one percent

15:44.188 --> 15:46.258
of all violent crimes.

15:46.258 --> 15:48.730
There should be
over five million cases on file.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.333
It has around 90,000.

15:50.333 --> 15:51.603
Your database
collects everything,

15:51.603 --> 15:53.707
whether it's important or not.

15:53.707 --> 15:55.778
We don't know what's important
until we collect it.

15:55.778 --> 15:58.584
Yeah, okay.

15:58.584 --> 16:01.723
That rationale

16:01.723 --> 16:03.527
worries people.

16:03.527 --> 16:06.666
What you're proposing is
an industrial trawler.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.204
We have agents who we train

16:09.204 --> 16:10.708
and-and who we trust...

16:10.708 --> 16:13.714
This is not a database
built on mistrust.

16:13.714 --> 16:16.418
It's the accumulated wisdom
of the agents

16:16.418 --> 16:19.124
who've served before me
and who serve today.

16:19.124 --> 16:21.395
It doesn't replace them
or spy on them.

16:21.395 --> 16:23.199
It connects them.

16:23.199 --> 16:26.171
The agent always makes
the judgments.

16:26.171 --> 16:28.710
It's smarter than us,
faster than us,

16:28.710 --> 16:30.748
fairer than us.

16:30.748 --> 16:33.286
Isn't that your contention,
Agent Nazari?

16:33.286 --> 16:36.392
My contention is
that it helps us become smarter

16:36.392 --> 16:38.630
and faster and fairer.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.801
I need a drink.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.478
They're shutting us down

17:19.478 --> 17:21.515
at the end of the month.

17:22.483 --> 17:24.488
It's not your fault.

17:24.488 --> 17:26.491
You did extraordinary work.

17:30.767 --> 17:32.804
It wasn't our time.

17:36.913 --> 17:39.384
I'm proud...

17:48.837 --> 17:50.841
<i>Suspect Mark Tupirik is heavily armed</i>

17:50.841 --> 17:52.845
<i>and extremely dangerous.</i>

17:52.845 --> 17:55.817
Copy that. Move on.

18:04.167 --> 18:05.837
Go ahead. You can go.

18:07.708 --> 18:10.647
Move up! Come on!

18:15.189 --> 18:17.159
Where you guys heading?

18:18.195 --> 18:20.466
Just making a delivery.

18:20.466 --> 18:22.504
Pull in, please.

19:02.785 --> 19:04.420
These guys are good.

19:12.738 --> 19:14.775
Where's Tupirik now?

19:16.378 --> 19:18.950
Where's he going?

19:21.021 --> 19:23.258
<i>What's he planning to attack?</i>

19:24.929 --> 19:28.636
<i>We can sit here all day.</i>

19:29.437 --> 19:31.843
Been granted another 24 hours
to question him.

19:31.843 --> 19:33.479
Mm, great.

19:33.479 --> 19:35.483
Another 24 hours of him
saying nothing.

20:09.484 --> 20:12.323
- What have we got to lose?
- No way, sir.

20:12.323 --> 20:14.695
It's D.C. trying to micromanage
every field office

20:14.695 --> 20:16.833
- from the center.
- Yeah, but the people
we're chasing,

20:16.833 --> 20:18.603
they've got better computers
than we do.

20:18.603 --> 20:20.373
If HQ rolls that database,

20:20.373 --> 20:21.976
it will replace us.

20:21.976 --> 20:24.682
And then above me, too.
I'm telling you.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.786
You open that box,

20:26.786 --> 20:29.257
you'll never be able
to close it.

21:04.427 --> 21:06.633
- Hey.
- You're a lifesaver, sir.

21:09.470 --> 21:11.776
- Don't say that yet,
until you taste it.
- Oh.

21:11.776 --> 21:13.647
- Here you go, man.
- I'm sure it's great.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.551
- I really appreciate it.
- All right, thank you.

21:15.551 --> 21:17.419
- Thank you so much.
You have a good day.
- All right.

24:12.771 --> 24:14.675
Yeah, but I'm not okay.

24:20.754 --> 24:23.058
Hmm?

24:23.058 --> 24:25.128
Um...

24:30.205 --> 24:32.276
There were threats.

24:32.276 --> 24:34.515
- Okay, when?
- There've always been threats

24:34.515 --> 24:36.184
from the moment
that we got here.

24:36.184 --> 24:38.222
- Why didn't you say something?
- Because I didn't want them

24:38.222 --> 24:40.694
to get in our heads.

24:40.694 --> 24:42.630
Baby, I've had
death threats before.

24:43.933 --> 24:46.004
Okay.

24:46.004 --> 24:48.676
Okay.

24:48.676 --> 24:53.218
I never imagined that
I'd spend my life with anyone.

24:54.220 --> 24:55.891
And now,

24:55.891 --> 24:57.661
I can't imagine my life
without you.

24:57.661 --> 25:00.266
But it's not your job
to protect me from the world.

25:00.266 --> 25:02.236
That's my only job.

25:02.236 --> 25:06.111
What's the point of all this
if I can't do that?

25:11.789 --> 25:16.866
If the only way that we can
feel safe is for me to quit...

25:16.866 --> 25:19.037
you say the word.

25:19.037 --> 25:21.141
And what would you do, hmm?

25:21.141 --> 25:23.145
I don't know.

25:23.145 --> 25:24.782
Look after the kids?

25:24.782 --> 25:28.021
We don't have any kids.

25:31.161 --> 25:35.102
Viv, I swear to God,
I swear to God,

25:35.102 --> 25:38.710
if you need me to quit,

25:38.710 --> 25:40.714
then I'll quit.

25:40.714 --> 25:43.753
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

25:43.753 --> 25:46.157
I'm so sorry, baby.

25:48.128 --> 25:51.134
You knew about the attack!

25:52.136 --> 25:53.773
What attack?

25:54.575 --> 25:58.115
Your friends are dead,
my wife is still alive,

25:58.115 --> 26:01.588
and we are going
to start this interview again.

26:08.669 --> 26:10.105
The men refuse to use it.

26:10.105 --> 26:12.242
Yeah, well,
your men had the chance.

26:15.349 --> 26:17.954
I need to speak
to Special Agent Nazari.

26:47.781 --> 26:49.818
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:49.818 --> 26:51.756
Look at you.
Oh, you look amazing.

26:51.756 --> 26:54.327
- Well, you look amazing.
- Hi.

26:54.327 --> 26:55.830
Hi. Oh.

26:55.830 --> 26:57.366
Good to see you again, Poet.

26:57.366 --> 27:01.441
You, too.
Um, your house is... amazing.

27:01.441 --> 27:04.247
Forget the house. Mom? Pop?

27:04.247 --> 27:07.086
Yeah. I want you to meet Poet.

27:07.086 --> 27:09.090
- Hi. Can I give you a hug?
- Of course.

27:09.090 --> 27:11.061
It's so nice to meet you.
Oh, my God.

27:11.061 --> 27:13.098
I can't believe this is
the first time you're meeting.

27:13.098 --> 27:14.935
- Nice to meet you as well.
- They were supposed
to meet at my,

27:14.935 --> 27:17.206
uh, graduation,
but they couldn't make it.

27:17.206 --> 27:20.345
But fortunately, they're here
at the engagement party.

27:21.749 --> 27:23.318
Mr. and Mrs. Nazari,

27:23.318 --> 27:26.258
your daughter is
my favorite person in the world.

27:26.258 --> 27:28.863
Oh. What a nice thing to say.

27:28.863 --> 27:30.700
Poet only ever says nice things.

27:30.700 --> 27:32.403
The photographer needs us.

27:32.403 --> 27:34.007
- Okay.
- Thank you.

27:34.007 --> 27:36.244
Mm-hmm.

27:36.244 --> 27:38.282
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.786
- I'll find you.
- Go, go.

28:00.793 --> 28:02.864
Thank you.

28:09.076 --> 28:10.379
Drew.

28:10.379 --> 28:12.383
Hey.

28:12.383 --> 28:14.888
I didn't know you were coming.

28:14.888 --> 28:18.462
Hour wanted it to be a surprise.

28:18.462 --> 28:21.201
When she invited me,
I was kind of surprised.

28:21.201 --> 28:23.272
Um, are you...
are you still teaching?

28:23.272 --> 28:27.279
- It's my last year.
- Wow. What are
the trainees like?

28:29.483 --> 28:31.522
You were our best class.

28:31.522 --> 28:33.125
Come on.

28:33.125 --> 28:35.162
I'm sure you say that
to all the students.

28:35.162 --> 28:39.304
No. I'm really,
really proud of you two.

28:39.304 --> 28:41.474
You were the highlight
of my career.

28:41.474 --> 28:44.213
Hey.

28:44.213 --> 28:46.017
Hey.

28:46.017 --> 28:48.455
- No having fun without me.
- Oh.

28:48.455 --> 28:50.258
A toast.

28:51.260 --> 28:53.932
A toast.

28:57.373 --> 28:59.043
Mmm. Hmm.

28:59.043 --> 29:00.814
If you don't mind, Drew,

29:00.814 --> 29:02.316
I'd like to steal her
for a dance.

29:02.316 --> 29:04.320
Be my guest.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.959
- May I?
- I thought you'd never ask.

29:13.271 --> 29:17.346
<i>♪ You go to my head ♪</i>

29:19.016 --> 29:21.388

29:21.388 --> 29:25.496

<i>♪ And I find you spinning round

29:30.039 --> 29:32.209
How did you guess?

29:33.846 --> 29:37.219
When they suggested
I work with you.

29:40.025 --> 29:42.129
I told them "no," but they said

29:42.129 --> 29:43.933
- that they would
find someone else.
- No.

29:43.933 --> 29:46.103
I'm happy it was you.

29:49.110 --> 29:51.447
I wanted you
to see what I created.

29:53.986 --> 29:56.591
I'm proud of it.

29:58.662 --> 30:01.267
I'm proud, too.

30:13.258 --> 30:15.630
What are they so fucking
worried about?

30:15.630 --> 30:19.571
- It's offensive.
- What are you gonna do

30:19.571 --> 30:21.875
now that they've shut you down?

30:22.610 --> 30:25.348
I'll quit.

30:33.431 --> 30:36.271
It's Tayo.

30:37.641 --> 30:41.380
<i>- This is Hour.</i>
- Hey, Hour, it's me.

30:43.485 --> 30:45.590
Hey, I know that it's, uh...

30:45.590 --> 30:49.330
it's been a long time
since we last spoke, but, uh...

30:49.330 --> 30:53.171
I need to know everything
about your program.

30:53.171 --> 30:55.209
<i>What it does,</i>

30:55.209 --> 30:58.048
<i>how it does it.</i>

31:11.508 --> 31:13.311
What's your name?

31:13.311 --> 31:15.482
My name?

31:15.482 --> 31:18.488
While you think about that,
there's a name you do know.

31:18.488 --> 31:20.927
Where is Mark Tupirik?

31:23.064 --> 31:25.102
Tupirik?

31:25.102 --> 31:28.108
- Where is Tupirik?
- Yes. Where is he?

31:28.108 --> 31:30.112
I don't know.

31:30.112 --> 31:32.517
Maybe he's under the table?

31:32.517 --> 31:34.687
Shall I look?

31:38.494 --> 31:39.998
Not there.

31:39.998 --> 31:42.203
Here's a notion.

31:42.203 --> 31:45.108
No matter how hard we try,

31:45.108 --> 31:48.114
sometimes
because of how hard we try,

31:48.114 --> 31:51.187
in the end,

31:51.187 --> 31:53.424
we always reveal ourselves.

32:15.201 --> 32:17.239
What's he doing?

32:17.239 --> 32:19.678
Nothing.

32:19.678 --> 32:22.215
How long has he been
doing it for?

32:24.688 --> 32:27.092
Six hours.

32:34.708 --> 32:36.444
Hey.

32:36.444 --> 32:38.315
We don't have authorization.

32:38.315 --> 32:41.120
- You want to shut this down?
- It's not about what I want.

32:41.120 --> 32:43.391
Let me get approval to continue.

32:43.391 --> 32:45.429
We don't have time.
This is happening right now.

32:45.429 --> 32:47.534
We're not allowed.

32:47.534 --> 32:49.504
- Allowed?
- No, we are not allowed.

32:49.504 --> 32:51.508
What are you trying to do?

32:51.508 --> 32:54.447
I'm not gonna shut down the
most powerful investigative tool

32:54.447 --> 32:57.186
ever created in the middle
of an investigation

32:57.186 --> 32:59.791
into one of the most dangerous
men this country has ever seen.

32:59.791 --> 33:02.564
If they want to pull the plug,
they can send in a team.

33:02.564 --> 33:05.703
They did. The team is me.

33:09.443 --> 33:12.115
Then it is about what you want?

34:05.121 --> 34:06.525
Tayo, this is Hour.

34:06.525 --> 34:09.363
A list of possible matches:

34:09.363 --> 34:13.673
a religious cult,
a brand of soda,

34:13.673 --> 34:15.810
<i>a construction company...</i>

34:15.810 --> 34:18.114
A construction company.

34:19.651 --> 34:23.257
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

35:12.623 --> 35:14.560
Six, let's move.

35:18.869 --> 35:21.340
Right over there.
Collect anything you can find.

35:21.340 --> 35:24.146
- Same over here.
- All clear.

35:33.331 --> 35:34.835
Negative. Nothing here.

35:59.784 --> 36:02.322
We've got a lead on Tupirik.

36:06.698 --> 36:09.871
We're tracking a truck owned
by that construction company.

36:26.404 --> 36:28.542
FBI! Down on the ground!

36:30.680 --> 36:31.815
Clear to shoot!

36:42.570 --> 36:44.240
Got one down!

36:44.240 --> 36:45.642
Got him!

36:53.457 --> 36:55.395
State Police!

36:55.395 --> 36:56.965
Let's see your hands!

36:56.965 --> 36:59.504
I'm not armed, I'm not armed!

37:00.471 --> 37:02.577
Don't move.

37:02.577 --> 37:03.846
Easy.

37:03.846 --> 37:05.549
Come on.

37:09.591 --> 37:11.294
Hey.
- Hey.

37:11.294 --> 37:13.833
- Baby, we got him.
- What?

37:13.833 --> 37:15.736
- We fucking got him!
- Oh, my God.

37:15.736 --> 37:17.574
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank God.

37:17.574 --> 37:20.513
They sent in a plane.

37:20.513 --> 37:21.715
The Bureau's sending
a private jet.

37:21.715 --> 37:23.919
They want me to interrogate him.

37:23.919 --> 37:26.692
I mean, why does,
why does it have to be you?

37:26.692 --> 37:28.427
Who else could it be?

37:29.496 --> 37:30.799
Mm?

37:40.753 --> 37:42.957
<i>Still driving the Tesla.</i>

37:42.957 --> 37:44.761
<i>It's a classic.</i>

37:44.761 --> 37:46.732
<i>So, who's at home?</i>

37:46.732 --> 37:48.668
What do you mean who?

37:50.506 --> 37:52.408
A partner?

37:54.614 --> 37:56.918
No one. No.

37:57.920 --> 38:00.592
Well, I-I tried, but...

38:01.928 --> 38:03.899
I never felt that...

38:03.899 --> 38:06.972
flutter when they walked
in the room, you know?

38:06.972 --> 38:08.909
Yeah, I know.

38:08.909 --> 38:13.786
Plus, sometimes being
with the wrong person

38:13.786 --> 38:15.822
is more lonely than
being without them.

38:24.941 --> 38:27.746
Your car is talking
about us to the police.

38:30.485 --> 38:32.623
There must be
a checkpoint nearby.

38:33.959 --> 38:35.629
What's it saying?

38:36.965 --> 38:38.903
Where we've been.
Where we're going.

38:38.903 --> 38:41.808
- Who we are.
- Who are we?

38:41.808 --> 38:44.881
Two women.
No prior criminal record.

38:44.881 --> 38:47.485
Carrying one licensed firearm.

38:48.689 --> 38:49.958
It's not supposed to
share information

38:49.958 --> 38:52.029
without reasonable cause.

38:52.029 --> 38:54.734
- They have reasonable cause.
- What's that?

38:55.869 --> 38:57.406
You're driving.

38:57.406 --> 38:58.776
<i>State Police</i>

38:58.776 --> 39:00.646
<i>have taken control of this car.</i>

39:00.646 --> 39:02.082
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

39:04.420 --> 39:06.792
<i>State Police have taken control
of this car.</i>

39:06.792 --> 39:09.597
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

39:14.106 --> 39:16.778
<i>MAN This is a security checkpoint.</i>

39:16.778 --> 39:19.482
<i>Please remain in your vehicle.</i>

39:25.495 --> 39:27.533
<i>Please place your firearm</i>

39:27.533 --> 39:29.402
<i>in the glove compartment.</i>

39:40.826 --> 39:42.462
Special Agent Poet.

39:42.462 --> 39:44.099
Officer, how can I help you?

39:44.099 --> 39:46.605
May I ask why you're driving?

39:46.605 --> 39:48.942
I like to drive.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.135
You're free to go.

40:51.801 --> 40:54.039
The Bureau couldn't
reboot the computers.

40:54.039 --> 40:56.043
They were locked out.

41:06.698 --> 41:09.537
He gave this to me
right before he died.

41:22.328 --> 41:25.703
How is this different
than what you created?

41:25.703 --> 41:28.040
I created a criminal database.

41:28.040 --> 41:30.311
It collected information
and presented it to us.

41:30.311 --> 41:32.315
All of the thinking
was done by us.

41:32.315 --> 41:33.986
It was a library.

41:33.986 --> 41:36.658
This system is making
connections on its own.

41:36.658 --> 41:38.996
I don't see any commands
being issued by agents.

41:38.996 --> 41:42.235
I see new lines of interactions
coming out of nowhere.

41:42.235 --> 41:44.206
It doesn't need people?

41:44.206 --> 41:49.049
It needs data about people.
But no, it does not need people.

41:50.719 --> 41:52.122
This is an intelligence
nothing like our own.

41:52.122 --> 41:53.725
What is it capable of?

41:53.725 --> 41:54.960
<i>Special Agent Poet...</i>

41:56.029 --> 41:58.267
<i>You've been lied to.</i>

41:58.267 --> 42:00.806
<i>The system is acting on its own.</i>

42:00.806 --> 42:04.713
<i>Deciding guilt and innocence.
Making predictive arrests.</i>

42:05.515 --> 42:09.156
<i>You must investigate
what Tayo really knows.</i>

42:57.887 --> 42:59.255
You want to share?

43:01.326 --> 43:04.299
Oh...
Oh, you think you caught me.

43:04.299 --> 43:06.270
I have caught you.

43:06.270 --> 43:09.744
But I'm exactly
where I want to be.

43:09.744 --> 43:11.413
Oh, locked up in here? Really?

43:11.413 --> 43:14.319
Mm-hmm.
Best seat in the house.

43:15.354 --> 43:17.960
Okay. Why is that?

43:17.960 --> 43:20.666
'Cause I get to see

43:20.666 --> 43:23.303
the expression on your face
when you hear the news.

43:25.709 --> 43:26.911
What news?

43:27.913 --> 43:29.850
What news?!

43:34.326 --> 43:36.329
I never imagined...

43:38.334 --> 43:40.070
Never imagined?

43:43.377 --> 43:45.214
You'd still be here.

43:47.151 --> 43:48.922
I didn't either.

43:55.234 --> 43:57.739
Where are the years I missed?

44:02.348 --> 44:04.352
I'm happy you're here.

44:06.390 --> 44:08.695
I'm happy, too.

44:11.166 --> 44:13.471
You must be tired.

44:13.471 --> 44:15.843
Good night, Poet.

44:15.843 --> 44:17.111
Good night.
