<i>~ Our love affair ~</i>

00:37.481 --> 00:43.149
<i>~ Is a wondrous thing ~</i>

00:43.249 --> 00:46.401
<i>~ That we'll rejoice ~</i>

00:46.824 --> 00:51.823
<i>~ In remembering ~</i>

00:52.120 --> 00:57.412
<i>~ Our love was born ~</i>

00:57.512 --> 01:01.543
<i>~ With our first embrace ~</i>

01:01.965 --> 01:07.664
<i>~ And a page was torn ~</i>

01:07.764 --> 01:11.805
<i>~ Out of time and space ~</i>

01:13.019 --> 01:17.827
<i>~ Our love affair ~</i>

01:17.927 --> 01:22.468
<i>~ May it always be ~</i>

01:22.568 --> 01:27.011
<i>~ A flame to burn ~</i>

01:27.111 --> 01:31.783
<i>~ Through eternity ~</i>

01:31.883 --> 01:36.607
<i>~ So take my hand ~</i>

01:36.707 --> 01:42.645
<i>~ With a fervent prayer ~</i>

01:42.745 --> 01:47.023
<i>~ That we may live ~</i>

01:47.123 --> 01:51.829
<i>~ And we may share ~</i>

01:52.022 --> 01:56.822
<i>~ A love affair ~</i>

01:57.152 --> 02:01.552
<i>~ To remember ~</i>

02:09.916 --> 02:13.573
While the New York Stock Exchange
showed signs of restlessness,

02:13.678 --> 02:16.867
there was little or no uneasiness
on the part of optimists.

02:16.972 --> 02:19.035
Here's good news for you bachelors.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.332
Competition for pretty girls
will definitely be easier

02:22.436 --> 02:26.753
now that Nickie Ferrante, the big
dame hunter, is going out of circulation.

02:26.857 --> 02:29.881
It'll be wedding bells for him at long last.

02:29.986 --> 02:32.342
Mr Ferrante is sailing today from Europe,

02:32.446 --> 02:35.970
and Miss Lois Clarke
will be waiting for him in New York -

02:36.074 --> 02:40.808
Lois and her lovely
600 million bucks. What a deal!

02:40.912 --> 02:45.450
Not only all that lettuce,
but a beautiful tomato too. Wow!

02:46.454 --> 02:48.528
<i>Eccovi una notizia straordinaria.</i>

02:48.632 --> 02:51.869
<i>Nickie Ferrante, il maestro</i>
<i>dell'arte dell'amore...</i>

02:51.973 --> 02:56.121
<i>... e la signorina Lois Clarke,</i>
<i>un'ereditiera americana...</i>

02:56.225 --> 03:00.845
<i>... dell'immensa ricchezza</i>
<i>di 600 milioni di dollari...</i>

03:01.391 --> 03:03.468
<i>600 milioni di dollari!</i>

03:04.061 --> 03:07.096
<i>E in lire italiane, quanti bilioni sarebbero?</i>

03:07.855 --> 03:09.231
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

03:13.653 --> 03:16.895
Here's rather a choice little titbit.

03:16.999 --> 03:22.025
Nickie Ferrante sails tonight
to enter into matrimony

03:22.129 --> 03:25.491
with one of America's industrial nobility.

03:26.710 --> 03:29.112
Rock and gravel, I believe.

03:29.216 --> 03:31.289
It's a Miss Lois...

03:32.925 --> 03:34.325
Clarke.

03:34.767 --> 03:35.767
Yes.

03:37.346 --> 03:38.346
Well.

03:48.024 --> 03:50.396
Well... there you have it.

03:57.579 --> 03:59.656
Signor Ferrante?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.076
Is he on board?

04:17.642 --> 04:19.718
Boy. Here I am.

04:19.935 --> 04:23.215
Signor Ferrante?
I have a telephone call for you from Paris.

04:23.319 --> 04:26.594
Mr Ferrante, would you autograph
this picture, please?

04:26.699 --> 04:29.231
I'm wanted on the telephone. Thank you.

04:33.076 --> 04:36.151
Hello. Yes, this is Ferrante.

04:36.255 --> 04:37.944
Who's calling?

04:38.048 --> 04:40.613
- Put her on.
- You beast.

04:41.168 --> 04:44.039
<i>Hello, Gabriella.</i>

04:44.755 --> 04:48.205
- Don't you talk to me.
- Well, then, why did you call me?

04:48.508 --> 04:52.581
How could you speak of love to me,
say the things you did,

04:52.685 --> 04:54.833
and you about to be married.

04:54.937 --> 04:58.052
Do you remember your words
when I gave you the cigarette case?

04:58.227 --> 05:00.303
Of course, dear. I said...

05:00.813 --> 05:02.428
I said...

05:02.532 --> 05:05.694
Hello! Can you hear me?
I believe we're disconnected.

05:05.989 --> 05:09.109
- We are not disconnected.
- Operator!

05:09.785 --> 05:11.771
Oh, this is a shame.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.575
<i>Hypocrite! I have in my hand a knife.</i>

05:15.291 --> 05:17.746
<i>And I wish it were in your back.</i>

05:18.043 --> 05:22.954
<i>Menteur! Lâche! Dégoûtant!</i>
<i>Tu n'as pas honte?</i>

05:28.053 --> 05:31.749
Well, Mr Ferrante!
My name's Hathaway. Ned Hathaway.

05:31.853 --> 05:34.296
- Really?
- Welcome aboard.

05:34.400 --> 05:39.428
I was wondering if you'd care to join my wife
and my sister and me in a game of bridge?

05:39.532 --> 05:41.981
I'm sorry, Mr Hathaway, but I cheat.

05:42.778 --> 05:44.854
It's an addiction.

05:56.083 --> 05:59.499
I beg your pardon.
I think you have my cigarette case.

06:05.260 --> 06:08.261
I might as well confess. I am a jewel thief.

06:09.014 --> 06:12.430
- I don't believe it.
- I was returning it to the purser.

06:12.559 --> 06:15.054
I found it in the...

06:15.566 --> 06:18.597
Just a moment. How do I know it's yours?

06:18.702 --> 06:22.693
Well. There's an inscription
to me on the inside.

06:26.495 --> 06:28.571
"To Nicolo..."

06:30.624 --> 06:33.238
Don't tell me you're the famous...

06:33.342 --> 06:37.991
Oh, I have read so much
about you in <i>Life</i> and <i>Look</i> and...

06:38.095 --> 06:40.370
Possibly <i>Good Housekeeping?</i>

06:40.474 --> 06:43.503
- Now, may I have my case?
- Just a moment.

06:48.185 --> 06:52.470
This is frightfully intimate. I know
just enough French to be embarrassed.

06:52.574 --> 06:56.599
Could you refine it a little
and tell me in effect what it says?

06:56.703 --> 06:58.771
Well, in effect, it says...

07:00.198 --> 07:07.078
"In memory of three unforgettable nights
aboard <i>La Gabriella."Which</i> is her yacht.

07:08.372 --> 07:10.448
I guess that's you all right.

07:11.835 --> 07:15.500
Tell me, did you write the song
"I'll Never Smile Again"?

07:16.756 --> 07:17.756
No.

07:18.476 --> 07:22.682
But I'm thinking of writing one
called "Moon over <i>La Gabriella".</i>

07:23.934 --> 07:27.684
Do you think it will ever
take the place of night baseball?

07:42.287 --> 07:44.363
Please wait.

07:45.206 --> 07:46.988
I'm in trouble.

07:47.093 --> 07:50.574
I could have told you -
playing around yachts. The poor thing.

07:50.679 --> 07:53.868
- I must talk with someone.
- I'm not very good at that.

07:53.972 --> 07:59.092
- I talk a lot. I've tried to break the habit...
- But you have such an honest face.

07:59.681 --> 08:01.840
- I have?
- I can trust you, can't I?

08:02.851 --> 08:04.882
- Yes, I suppose so.
- Good. Come with me.

08:04.987 --> 08:08.636
The captain has an honest face too.
Why not tell him your troubles?

08:08.740 --> 08:11.347
- Shall we go to your cabin or mine?
- No. Mine.

08:11.451 --> 08:14.610
- Mine's just around the corner.
- Mine's here.

08:17.699 --> 08:19.775
It's not that I'm prudish.

08:20.661 --> 08:24.318
But my mother told me never to enter
a man's room in months ending in "r".

08:24.423 --> 08:26.023
She did?

08:29.712 --> 08:33.844
Oh, well. Your mother's not
only beautiful, she's clever too.

08:34.513 --> 08:37.087
- What is your name?
- Terry McKay.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.842
Terry McKay, and I'm travelling alone.

08:40.946 --> 08:44.428
- Was that what was troubling you?
- Yes.

08:44.532 --> 08:46.600
- May I?
- You may.

08:47.651 --> 08:49.652
Thank you.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.983
I think you can leave it here.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.692
You know, this couldn't be nicer.
You saved my life.

09:00.796 --> 09:04.322
I was bored to death. I hadn't seen
one attractive woman on board.

09:04.426 --> 09:09.621
Isn't that terrible? I was alarmed. I thought
"Don't beautiful women travel any more?"

09:09.725 --> 09:13.300
Then I saw you, and I was saved... I hope.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.632
Tell me. Have you been getting
results with a line like that?

09:21.736 --> 09:24.010
Or would I be surprised?

09:24.114 --> 09:26.387
If you were surprised, I'd be surprised.

09:26.492 --> 09:28.554
That sounds like a nasty crack.

09:28.658 --> 09:32.100
- I could make a few too, if I wanted to.
- I'm sure you could.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.897
- All right. I think I will.
- I'm listening.

09:35.001 --> 09:38.830
Does your fiancée know
the lady of the yacht, Gabriella?

09:39.252 --> 09:41.790
Certainly. She's her best friend.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.833
Chummy little group.

09:48.429 --> 09:51.134
You know, this ship is going much too fast.

09:52.350 --> 09:55.507
We ought to take advantage of every moment.

09:55.610 --> 10:00.303
Don't you think that life should be gay
and bright and bubbly, like champagne?

10:00.408 --> 10:02.969
- I like pink champagne.
- That's the kind I mean.

10:03.073 --> 10:08.018
Is there any reason why this trip
shouldn't be pink champagne?

10:08.123 --> 10:09.123
What?

10:13.373 --> 10:15.173
Oh, dear.

10:19.879 --> 10:22.577
- He wouldn't like it?
- No.

10:22.681 --> 10:24.205
- Husband?
- No.

10:24.310 --> 10:26.377
- He still wouldn't like it?
- No.

10:27.846 --> 10:30.754
Why isn't he travelling with you?

10:30.858 --> 10:33.636
Because he had to go
to Texas on a big merger.

10:34.352 --> 10:39.052
He thought it'd be a good idea if I took
a trip while he consummated this big deal,

10:39.157 --> 10:41.430
because I have no head for business.

10:41.534 --> 10:44.806
It's beyond me how
the more money a corporation loses,

10:44.910 --> 10:48.566
the more it makes,
because of the carry-overs with the write-offs.

10:48.670 --> 10:53.320
The big secret seems to be to merge a sick
corporation with a big, fat healthy one,

10:53.424 --> 10:56.078
- and then everybody gets well.
- Silly, isn't it?

10:56.182 --> 11:01.916
He doesn't think I'm dumb, but he doesn't
think I'm very bright. About things like that.

11:02.020 --> 11:04.956
- It isn't necessary, is it?
- Thank you.

11:05.061 --> 11:07.131
That's all right.

11:08.892 --> 11:11.015
- So he trusts you?
- Implicitly.

11:12.396 --> 11:16.263
- No mistakes? No errors?
- Five faithful years.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.179
Sounds awful, doesn't it? But it's true.

11:20.283 --> 11:22.357
Yes. Well, there you are.

11:23.326 --> 11:25.402
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

11:27.371 --> 11:29.153
I don't...

11:29.258 --> 11:32.823
You could light it from that inscription,
couldn't you?

11:32.927 --> 11:35.411
I like that. I must stay tuned into you.

11:36.924 --> 11:40.330
He's a very lucky fellow.
Must be a remarkable man.

11:40.434 --> 11:46.708
Well, you can imagine how attractive he is
when I can resist so charming a person as...

11:46.813 --> 11:49.015
Yes, yes. I understand.

11:49.895 --> 11:52.267
Well, it was nice, wasn't it?

11:53.273 --> 11:57.571
Oh, well. Well, there's still
deck tennis, shuffleboard, bingo.

11:58.658 --> 12:03.692
- Don't tell me you're embarrassed?
- Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.

12:03.796 --> 12:06.652
- Oh, I <i>am</i> sorry.
- That's all right. Don't apologise.

12:06.756 --> 12:08.903
I do hope it won't affect your ego!

12:09.007 --> 12:13.213
No, please, don't think anything of it.
I'll just take my ego for a walk.

12:13.839 --> 12:16.454
- Unless you'd care to...
- Have dinner with you?

12:16.559 --> 12:18.627
I'd love to.

12:26.144 --> 12:28.214
Here comes my friend Ferrante now.

12:28.318 --> 12:33.061
Mr Ferrante, I'd like to have you meet
my sister, Miss Hathaway, and my wife...

12:41.120 --> 12:46.359
And when you were little, what did
your nurse read to you at bedtime?

12:46.464 --> 12:49.156
- Let me think...
- The memoirs of Casanova?

12:49.260 --> 12:52.033
Every night. And then we'd turn out the light.

12:52.137 --> 12:54.456
- "We"?
- I was only so big.

12:55.050 --> 12:57.248
You must have had a happy childhood.

12:57.353 --> 12:58.626
Ah, yes.

12:59.639 --> 13:02.253
- And women...
- Oh, women.

13:02.358 --> 13:05.346
- You've known quite a few, haven't you?
- I don't know.

13:05.450 --> 13:09.513
- Perhaps "few" is the wrong word.
- Let's say it's not precise.

13:09.618 --> 13:14.987
I beg pardon, Signor Ferrante. Shall
I reserve this table for you every night?

13:16.703 --> 13:18.779
- Why not?
- Thank you.

13:19.831 --> 13:23.570
- Now, where were we?
- I suppose they were all in love with you.

13:23.675 --> 13:26.865
- I doubt it.
- But you haven't had much respect for them.

13:26.969 --> 13:30.415
- On the contrary.
- You've always been fair in your judgments.

13:30.717 --> 13:34.080
I've been more than fair. I idealise them.

13:34.184 --> 13:36.293
Every woman I meet, I put up there.

13:36.398 --> 13:39.383
Of course, the longer I know her,
and the better I know her...

13:39.487 --> 13:41.803
It's hard to keep them up there, isn't it?

13:41.939 --> 13:44.175
Pretty soon, the pedestal wobbles

13:44.279 --> 13:46.350
and then topples.

13:46.902 --> 13:48.978
<i>C'est la vie.</i> Et cetera.

13:50.238 --> 13:52.908
Now, come on. Let's talk about you.

13:54.118 --> 13:56.157
No. Not tonight.

13:56.370 --> 13:58.817
We'll talk about me some other time.

13:58.921 --> 14:02.904
- We've nothing planned for tomorrow.
- Oh, I have.

14:03.009 --> 14:06.453
Oh, no. We'll talk about <i>me</i> tomorrow.

14:16.687 --> 14:20.549
It turned out beautifully, didn't it?
It's really warm.

14:20.654 --> 14:22.654
Thank you.

14:23.695 --> 14:27.186
Now, where were we? You were
going to tell me where you were born.

14:27.290 --> 14:30.447
- That's right. Well...
- Mr Ferrante? Telegram.

14:30.951 --> 14:32.951
Thank you.

14:33.125 --> 14:35.190
Excuse me, Miss McKay.

14:35.295 --> 14:37.154
- Miss McKay?
- Yes?

14:37.258 --> 14:39.570
I have one for you too.

14:39.674 --> 14:41.745
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:42.588 --> 14:44.665
Excuse me, Mr Ferrante.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.728
- From him?
- From her?

15:05.655 --> 15:07.648
Well, where were <i>we?</i>

15:08.491 --> 15:11.521
Well, I was about to tell you where I was born.

15:11.626 --> 15:14.105
And I was born in Boston.

15:14.210 --> 15:16.404
I can hardly wait for you to grow up.

15:16.509 --> 15:19.869
Be patient. I grew up... quickly.

15:20.799 --> 15:25.501
I went to New York, and I got a job singing in
a nightclub from ten to three in the morning.

15:25.605 --> 15:30.965
The manager used to chase me round the
office until four, then... I went home.

15:31.069 --> 15:33.138
- Did he ever...
- Oh, no.

15:33.648 --> 15:37.593
Well, then one evening... <i>he</i> came along.

15:37.697 --> 15:39.768
Oh, this is the fellow.

15:40.195 --> 15:45.321
And he said "You don't
belong in a place like this."

15:45.534 --> 15:49.663
- Really?
- And I said "I don't?"

15:51.999 --> 15:55.400
And then... what?

15:55.679 --> 15:58.119
- What what?
- I thought you said something.

15:58.223 --> 16:02.788
- No, I didn't say anything.
- I'm sorry. But you're right, you know.

16:02.892 --> 16:06.001
He said I belonged in
a penthouse on Park Avenue,

16:06.105 --> 16:09.053
with a breathtaking view of the East River.

16:12.146 --> 16:17.014
- An ideal place for you to improve yourself.
- Yes. So I studied hard.

16:17.118 --> 16:19.390
- Singing?
- And music

16:19.494 --> 16:22.228
and art. Literature.

16:22.333 --> 16:25.354
So that one day you'd make
a perfectly charming wife.

16:25.459 --> 16:27.689
Yes, that was the general idea.

16:27.793 --> 16:30.739
- Anything wrong with that?
- No, no, nothing.

16:30.843 --> 16:32.710
That's what I thought.

16:35.758 --> 16:38.712
Well, that sort of brings us up to date.

16:39.513 --> 16:41.877
Now my life is an open book.

16:41.981 --> 16:44.172
That's only one page.

16:44.276 --> 16:46.344
That's the only page.

16:52.985 --> 16:55.099
I beg your pardon.

16:55.204 --> 16:57.098
Thank you.

16:57.203 --> 16:59.356
- No, no. Bad.
- Wait a minute.

16:59.908 --> 17:03.438
- That's an interesting camera. May I see that?
- Oh, yes.

17:03.543 --> 17:05.614
It's new, isn't it?

17:06.124 --> 17:08.194
Please! Stop!

17:08.299 --> 17:10.614
That's unfortunate, isn't it?

17:10.718 --> 17:12.789
That was not very nice.

17:14.675 --> 17:17.500
- You shouldn't have done that.
- I know.

17:17.604 --> 17:21.878
You know, it's obviously no good
either of us being seen together.

17:21.983 --> 17:26.590
Right or wrong, people will talk, and so...
I guess it had better be goodbye.

17:26.695 --> 17:28.763
- That seems a pity.
- Goodbye.

17:29.607 --> 17:31.843
What's the matter? Are you afraid?

17:31.948 --> 17:33.845
- Of you?
- Yes.

17:33.950 --> 17:34.951
No.

17:35.415 --> 17:40.648
You know, we have several days to go
on this voyage, and I can't stand monotony.

17:40.752 --> 17:43.778
Well, you can always take
long walks in the sunshine.

17:43.882 --> 17:45.952
What'll I do if it rains?

17:48.215 --> 17:50.701
No. It's no good.

17:50.805 --> 17:54.668
- You mean it's particularly no good for you.
- Yes.

17:55.054 --> 18:00.428
Being seen with you is news, and
I don't want to get my picture in the papers.

18:01.979 --> 18:05.219
So, I'll go my way

18:05.324 --> 18:07.723
and you go yours.

18:17.287 --> 18:18.287
Help!

18:20.499 --> 18:23.945
Here. Let me... You're heavy.

18:24.049 --> 18:27.868
- Are you in trouble?
- Yes. Give me a hand, will you? He's heavy.

18:27.972 --> 18:30.367
Come on, chum.

18:30.472 --> 18:32.204
Now, let go.

18:32.309 --> 18:36.792
- Try it the other way round, Dad.
- Thank you. You're a great help.

18:36.897 --> 18:39.088
Well, how'd you come to do that?

18:39.193 --> 18:42.048
I got tangled up.

18:42.152 --> 18:44.851
Couldn't get down?

18:46.109 --> 18:49.726
- You're quite a fellow.
- You're quite a fellow yourself.

18:49.830 --> 18:53.520
- Yes? Why?
- Everybody on the ship's talkin' about ya.

18:53.625 --> 18:57.362
- No kidding. What are they saying?
- I don't know.

18:57.466 --> 19:01.871
Every time they start talkin' about you,
they make me leave the room.

19:05.007 --> 19:07.676
- I don't get it.
- You take over.

19:10.804 --> 19:13.630
You want to watch it, chum.
You might hurt yourself.

19:13.734 --> 19:16.089
When I was little, I fell and broke my leg.

19:16.193 --> 19:18.262
How is it now?

19:18.772 --> 19:23.096
- Well, it's all right, I guess.
- Well, what are you crabbing about?

19:23.200 --> 19:25.271
I'm not crab...

19:26.156 --> 19:27.816
I'm sorry.

19:28.992 --> 19:31.068
Champagne cocktail, please.

19:32.079 --> 19:35.697
- Have you any cigarettes?
- The smoke-room steward, sir.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.153
- Have you got pink champagne?
- Of course.

19:39.258 --> 19:41.328
Let me try a little.

19:46.677 --> 19:48.541
Good evening.

19:48.645 --> 19:51.424
Could I have a champagne cocktail, please?

19:52.892 --> 19:55.517
- Do you have pink champagne?
- Of course.

19:55.649 --> 19:57.649
Thank you.

20:24.220 --> 20:25.420
Hello.

20:32.271 --> 20:34.597
I changed my table to a table for one.

20:35.775 --> 20:37.575
So did I.

20:37.866 --> 20:43.151
Now isn't that a shame, after that delightful
dinner we had together last night?

20:47.703 --> 20:50.151
- Do you speak Gaelic?
- Fluently.

20:50.255 --> 20:52.656
How do you say "Let's get out of here"?

21:01.676 --> 21:03.757
Well, well, well!

21:06.770 --> 21:07.770
Well!

21:55.612 --> 21:58.899
Well, well, well. That's good, isn't it?

22:01.577 --> 22:04.147
This is what's known as fooling the world.

22:04.251 --> 22:08.192
- What'd you say?
- This is called fooling the world.

22:08.297 --> 22:11.324
I can't hear what you're saying.

22:11.428 --> 22:15.886
Who do you think you're hiding from?
Everybody's staring at us. It's awful.

22:21.060 --> 22:24.310
- This is awful. I'm going to leave.
- No, no. Let me.

22:25.524 --> 22:27.324
Sit down.

22:35.033 --> 22:38.896
- Pardon, sir. That's the lady's purse.
- I know. I was just...

22:39.000 --> 22:41.154
No, wait a minute. The last one...

23:18.704 --> 23:20.907
Oh, my, it's a small pool, isn't it?

23:21.012 --> 23:25.131
- You've got my cigarette case.
- Well, not on me.

23:27.051 --> 23:29.542
We've got a five-hour stopover
in Villefranche.

23:29.720 --> 23:33.635
- Yes. Are you going ashore?
- Yes. I'm calling on a lady.

23:33.766 --> 23:37.712
- In every port, huh?
- This happens to be my grandmother.

23:37.816 --> 23:39.881
- Don't you believe me?
- No!

23:39.986 --> 23:43.305
- Would you like to meet her?
- Yes, I'd like to meet her.

23:43.409 --> 23:45.477
Well, you've got a date.

23:46.445 --> 23:48.522
- Surprised?
- All right.

24:07.302 --> 24:11.513
- A present for your little old grandmother?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

24:13.349 --> 24:16.464
Isn't it beautiful down there?

24:16.568 --> 24:19.508
- Yes, but do you want to hear an old joke?
- What?

24:19.613 --> 24:22.726
- If it's so beautiful down there, why...
- Bring me up here?

24:22.860 --> 24:25.013
That's an old joke all right.

24:25.117 --> 24:28.103
You're quite sure your grandmother
isn't an old joke?

24:28.208 --> 24:30.279
Oh, I do wish you'd trust me.

24:57.233 --> 24:59.641
What a divine place.

25:02.280 --> 25:07.314
It's perfect. I'm beginning
to think you <i>have</i> a grandmother.

25:07.419 --> 25:10.828
That's surprising.
I'll try to find her and prove it.

25:26.348 --> 25:28.424
She's not there.

25:33.730 --> 25:37.684
Look. She must be in the chapel.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.116
How are you, fella?

25:54.506 --> 25:59.962
What is it about this place? Something
about it makes you want to whisper.

26:01.012 --> 26:04.209
It's so peaceful here. It's like another world.

26:04.314 --> 26:07.172
Well, it is. It's my grandmother's world.

26:07.276 --> 26:09.550
Do tell me more about her.

26:09.654 --> 26:13.594
My grandfather was in the diplomatic service.
They travelled the world.

26:13.698 --> 26:16.058
When he retired, they came here to live.

26:16.162 --> 26:18.852
He's buried there behind the chapel.

26:18.956 --> 26:21.020
She stayed on to be near him.

26:21.124 --> 26:25.532
She must be waiting, I think impatiently,
for the day she will join him.

26:53.198 --> 26:55.229
<i>Mais pourquoi tu ne m'as pas prévenue?</i>

26:55.333 --> 26:57.483
<i>J'ai voulu te faire une surprise!</i>

27:01.582 --> 27:05.448
<i>- C'est vrai que tu vas te marier?</i>
<i>- Oui, ça en a bien l'air.</i>

27:06.002 --> 27:10.047
<i>- Et toi. Tu rajeunis tous les jours!</i>
<i>- Blagueur!</i>

27:16.764 --> 27:19.516
- Is this the girl?
- No.

27:27.275 --> 27:29.679
Darling, this is Terry McKay.

27:29.783 --> 27:31.477
How do you do?

27:31.582 --> 27:34.443
Janou thought you were the girl
I'm going to marry.

27:35.535 --> 27:38.358
<i>Elle est charmante. Elle me plait beaucoup.</i>

27:38.463 --> 27:41.650
<i>Pardon.</i> I was only saying
I like you very much.

27:41.754 --> 27:44.287
Thank you. I'm glad.

27:44.919 --> 27:48.205
Well, if you will excuse me, I must sit down.

27:49.215 --> 27:51.753
I am longer at my prayers nowadays.

27:53.094 --> 27:55.698
Oh, my knees!

27:55.900 --> 27:57.969
They're as old as I am.

27:58.980 --> 28:02.710
You have the most beautiful place here.

28:02.814 --> 28:03.857
Thank you.

28:03.961 --> 28:09.060
- I think I could stay here for ever.
- <i>Oh, non!</i> You are too young for that.

28:09.164 --> 28:12.193
It is a good place to sit and remember,

28:13.035 --> 28:16.654
but you have still to create your memories.

28:19.375 --> 28:22.866
And the chapel seems so charming.

28:22.970 --> 28:25.365
- Would you like to go in?
- Oh, may I?

28:25.470 --> 28:27.542
<i>- Je vous en prie.</i>
- Thank you.

28:29.387 --> 28:31.463
Oh, Nicolo!

28:34.934 --> 28:39.803
And you, Nicolo. How long is it
since you have been in a chapel?

28:39.907 --> 28:41.302
Well, I...

28:41.406 --> 28:44.141
- Not since you were an altar boy.
- I know.

28:44.246 --> 28:47.598
- Go in. It won't hurt you.
- All right.

28:47.702 --> 28:49.850
- I will prepare the tea.
- Let me help you.

28:49.955 --> 28:52.025
<i>Non, non, non. Vas-y.</i>

30:48.125 --> 30:50.989
<i>Marius! Devinez qui est arrivé.</i>

30:51.093 --> 30:53.838
<i>- Et qui est arrivé, madame?</i>
<i>- Regardez.</i>

30:55.841 --> 30:57.799
<i>Oh, monsieur Nicolas!</i>

31:03.015 --> 31:05.091
<i>Je suis content!</i>

31:07.978 --> 31:10.054
<i>II y a la grand-mère.</i>

31:12.526 --> 31:14.806
- This is Marie.
- Well, hello!

31:14.910 --> 31:17.850
<i>- C'est la dernière?</i>
<i>- Oui, c'est la plus jeune.</i>

31:17.954 --> 31:20.022
<i>- Combien maintenant?</i>
<i>- Sept.</i>

31:20.126 --> 31:22.825
<i>Depuis que vous êtes parti, ça fait trois.</i>

31:23.791 --> 31:26.822
This is my friend Marius.

31:26.926 --> 31:29.783
Marius has had three children
since I last saw him.

31:29.888 --> 31:33.215
Marius says France needs men.

31:33.343 --> 31:35.383
So he has seven daughters.

31:36.637 --> 31:40.046
- Come to see the rest of my family.
- Yes, go along.

31:40.150 --> 31:43.798
- Sure?
- I should like a tête-à-tête with Miss McKay.

31:43.903 --> 31:45.971
Janou, please be kind.

31:46.565 --> 31:48.641
I won't betray you.

31:51.111 --> 31:53.437
- Can I help you?
- Thank you, my dear.

31:54.491 --> 32:00.107
I am glad you are not, like so many young
people nowadays, above a little housework.

32:00.212 --> 32:05.616
There were ten of us in our family. We all had
to do our share, or go to bed without supper.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.826
Oh, what a magnificent room.

32:07.931 --> 32:11.290
Oh, yes. My husband was a great collector.

32:12.009 --> 32:14.085
He loved beautiful things.

32:14.595 --> 32:15.871
Me too.

32:15.975 --> 32:19.212
I should have a housekeeper,
but I have outlived two.

32:19.316 --> 32:22.429
And I'm too old to start
breaking in another one.

32:23.438 --> 32:29.308
Besides, I don't mind telling you -
I had planned only to live till I was 80.

32:29.412 --> 32:35.113
Now I am 82. If I'm not going to die,
I must start saving money for my old age.

32:35.914 --> 32:37.990
You're very wise.

32:41.002 --> 32:43.754
- You like it?
- Yes. It's charming.

32:49.219 --> 32:52.581
- Nickie?
- Yes. He did that a long time ago.

32:52.686 --> 32:55.128
But it's very good!

32:55.232 --> 32:57.301
He is very talented.

32:58.311 --> 33:01.646
Forgive me. You see,
I had no means of knowing.

33:02.317 --> 33:05.437
Unfortunately, he's also very critical.

33:06.154 --> 33:10.310
The artist in him would create.
The critic would destroy.

33:10.415 --> 33:14.399
- As a result, he has done nothing since.
- What a pity.

33:14.503 --> 33:18.162
Besides, he's been too busy
"living", as they call it.

33:20.001 --> 33:22.243
- May I?
- Oh, thank you, my dear.

33:23.505 --> 33:24.705
There.

33:27.342 --> 33:31.257
It has been such a tremendous
excitement for me, this visit.

33:31.806 --> 33:33.882
I am trying to appear calm.

33:34.725 --> 33:39.107
- Don't you think I do pretty well?
- You do wonderfully well.

33:41.778 --> 33:44.235
- There we are.
- Thank you.

33:45.158 --> 33:47.316
I love Nicolo so much.

33:48.619 --> 33:53.947
When he was a small boy,
he charmed us all with his piano playing.

33:54.051 --> 33:56.116
Then he studied painting.

33:56.794 --> 34:00.285
And the worst of it is
he's so good at everything.

34:00.389 --> 34:02.534
A jack of all talents?

34:02.639 --> 34:06.374
Everything comes too easily to him.

34:06.478 --> 34:10.628
He's always attracted by
the art he isn't practising,

34:10.733 --> 34:14.262
the place he hasn't been,
the girl he hasn't met.

34:15.648 --> 34:17.806
Perhaps <i>I shouldn't have met him.</i>

34:19.860 --> 34:22.268
No, my dear. You are different.

34:24.032 --> 34:28.860
I don't mind confessing to you -
I have been worried about him.

34:30.538 --> 34:32.946
- Sometimes I'm frightened.
- Why?

34:34.167 --> 34:40.917
That life will present a bill to Nicolo one day,
and he will find it hard to pay.

34:45.475 --> 34:50.053
But when I see you with him, I feel better.

34:52.149 --> 34:54.097
Me? You do?

34:54.201 --> 34:56.001
Yes, you.

34:57.530 --> 35:00.733
I wish I could share your confidence.

35:01.325 --> 35:06.320
You will have it when you need it.
That is your character.

35:08.249 --> 35:13.919
There is nothing wrong with Nicolo
that a good woman couldn't make right.

35:23.474 --> 35:26.421
I saw Marius's entire family.
Seven daughters!

35:26.525 --> 35:30.637
- I had a nice talk with his wife.
- You should have had a nice talk with him.

35:30.741 --> 35:32.808
And don't sit on my hat.

35:35.362 --> 35:38.695
Tell me, what have you two
been talking about?

35:38.823 --> 35:41.437
- You'd be surprised.
- I'll bet I would.

35:41.541 --> 35:44.647
And I'll bet that Janou did all the talking.

35:44.752 --> 35:48.071
She told me that when you were a boy
and didn't get your own way,

35:48.175 --> 35:51.075
you'd lie on the floor and kick,
and get red in the face.

35:51.179 --> 35:52.579
Really?

35:52.806 --> 35:55.208
You should have winked the other eye.

35:56.262 --> 35:59.631
- What did you say?
- I said you didn't do that any more.

36:00.099 --> 36:01.100
No.

36:02.144 --> 36:06.224
Now, when you don't get your own way,
you just get embarrassed.

36:10.860 --> 36:12.930
Want some tea?

36:13.034 --> 36:15.984
Remind me not to explain that to you later.

36:16.658 --> 36:18.856
Yes, I want some tea.

36:18.961 --> 36:21.028
Janou, I have a gift for you.

36:21.705 --> 36:23.736
Come and see it.

36:23.841 --> 36:27.082
- I am too old for gifts.
- No one's too old for gifts.

36:27.754 --> 36:33.129
- You shouldn't spend your money recklessly.
- It didn't cost much. Let me help you.

36:48.192 --> 36:52.265
- How did you do it?
- I did it from memory.

36:52.369 --> 36:54.369
Thank you.

36:56.368 --> 36:59.986
It is André! My husband.

37:01.164 --> 37:04.703
It's so real. So like him.

37:05.548 --> 37:07.624
What a remarkable face.

37:08.926 --> 37:12.084
- Did you do that from memory?
- Yes.

37:12.189 --> 37:14.417
Do you like it?

37:14.521 --> 37:16.502
It's wonderful.

37:16.607 --> 37:21.642
You know, I painted that a long time ago,
but I hesitated about giving it to you.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.436
I told you he has talent.

37:37.540 --> 37:40.079
- Well, now. For you.
- For me? Thank you.

37:42.212 --> 37:44.212
Thank you.

37:44.965 --> 37:46.365
For me.

37:47.389 --> 37:48.832
Well, now.

37:48.937 --> 37:51.383
I should like to propose a little toast.

37:52.765 --> 37:55.302
I don't quite know how to phrase it.

37:56.059 --> 38:00.556
Well, would it have something
to do with his happy marriage?

38:06.905 --> 38:08.974
Shall we say:

38:09.079 --> 38:13.870
May your voyage home be a pleasant one.

38:17.336 --> 38:19.337
Thank you.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.102
Well, now. I'm afraid
we must be leaving soon.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.521
It has been a good day.

38:45.783 --> 38:49.912
Before we go, you must play the piano for us.

38:51.164 --> 38:54.111
- Come along.
- Please do.

38:54.215 --> 38:56.996
- Look at my hands.
- No excuses. Come along.

39:01.758 --> 39:03.873
Janou was a concert pianist.

39:03.977 --> 39:04.977
Was.

39:05.855 --> 39:08.550
Remember, I was asked to do this.

40:43.374 --> 40:47.973
<i>~ Ce bel amour ~</i>

40:48.805 --> 40:54.318
<i>~ Qui ne peut mourir ~</i>

40:54.418 --> 40:58.726
<i>~ Sera pour nous ~</i>

40:58.826 --> 41:03.587
<i>~ Un doux souvenir ~</i>

41:03.687 --> 41:08.364
<i>~ Promesse ardente ~</i>

41:08.464 --> 41:12.886
<i>~ Du premier baiser ~</i>

41:12.986 --> 41:18.223
<i>~ Qui nous lie tous deux ~</i>

41:18.323 --> 41:22.852
<i>~ Pour I'éternité ~</i>

41:23.124 --> 41:28.124
<i>~ D'un bel amour ~</i>

41:28.671 --> 41:33.085
<i>~ Toujours grandissant ~</i>

41:33.594 --> 41:37.917
<i>~ Qui défiera ~</i>

41:38.017 --> 41:44.062
<i>~ Les épreuves du temps ~</i>

41:44.162 --> 41:49.073
<i>~ Trouvons la joie ~</i>

41:49.173 --> 41:52.696
<i>~ Reste dans mes bras ~</i>

42:08.842 --> 42:11.168
I don't like boat whistles.

42:26.779 --> 42:30.058
Don't you think you should
put this round your shoulders?

42:30.162 --> 42:32.233
Thank you, my dear.

42:34.453 --> 42:36.900
- It's lovely, isn't it?
- You like it?

42:37.005 --> 42:38.696
Yes, I do.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.532
One day, I will send it to you.

42:41.636 --> 42:43.037
Oh, no.

42:43.386 --> 42:45.460
I would like to.

42:56.773 --> 42:59.093
This is as far as I go.

42:59.197 --> 43:02.643
This is the boundary of my small world.

43:08.993 --> 43:11.070
It's a perfect world.

43:13.248 --> 43:15.490
Thank you for letting me trespass.

43:16.543 --> 43:18.143
Goodbye.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.596
Bless you.

43:21.966 --> 43:24.007
Well, <i>au revoir,</i> dear Janou.

43:24.553 --> 43:28.218
I'll come back to see you very soon,
and I'll write often.

43:29.349 --> 43:31.425
- Please do.
- I will.

43:37.356 --> 43:40.608
- Happy thoughts, darling.
<i>- Adieu, mon petit.</i>

44:03.138 --> 44:04.738
Goodbye.

44:31.377 --> 44:35.874
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I called your cabin sev...

44:36.675 --> 44:38.917
You've been crying.

44:43.723 --> 44:45.798
Beauty does that to me.

44:47.352 --> 44:49.089
Nickie, I...

44:49.193 --> 44:51.718
I want to thank you for...

44:51.822 --> 44:55.888
the loveliest and the most
memorable day I've ever known.

44:55.992 --> 44:58.940
You were very sweet
to my little grandmother.

44:59.906 --> 45:03.956
- I'm going to write to her.
- That'll be nice.

45:08.420 --> 45:10.496
Let's walk.

46:03.811 --> 46:05.759
No more tears.

46:05.864 --> 46:08.477
I told you. That's what beauty does to me.

46:20.041 --> 46:22.579
We're heading into a rough sea, Nickie.

46:23.546 --> 46:26.381
I know. We changed our course today.

46:29.467 --> 46:31.543
Shall I see you to your cabin?

46:32.470 --> 46:34.956
I don't think so.

46:35.060 --> 46:37.132
Good night.

47:12.138 --> 47:14.214
Just a moment.

47:19.859 --> 47:23.682
- Why did you come here? It's dangerous.
- We've got a lot to talk about.

47:23.787 --> 47:27.981
I am aware of that, but to be seen
together could be disastrous for us both.

47:28.085 --> 47:31.400
We have some fast thinking to do.
We've created a problem.

47:31.504 --> 47:36.288
Yes, I know, so let's not
complicate it any more.

47:36.667 --> 47:41.368
Being a woman, I'm more cautious and I can
think more clearly when you're not around.

47:41.472 --> 47:45.326
So you go think in your room,
and I'll think in mine...

47:45.430 --> 47:48.132
- All right.
- While we miss each other.

47:50.474 --> 47:53.429
That was very sweet. What you just said.

48:11.496 --> 48:15.570
- Top o' the mornin' to you.
- And the rest of the day to you. Listen...

48:15.674 --> 48:18.115
- Keep moving.
- Oh, dear.

48:18.219 --> 48:20.288
Wait a minute. Don't go away.

48:21.340 --> 48:25.005
- Have you come to any conclusions yet?
- No. Keep moving.

48:26.387 --> 48:27.922
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

48:28.028 --> 48:32.258
- Why don't you telephone more often?
- I'll try, but you know...

48:32.362 --> 48:36.568
- Were you going to say something?
- No, I wasn't going to say anything.

48:37.069 --> 48:40.764
Couldn't we at least eat together?
In your room or my room?

48:40.869 --> 48:43.895
No. The news'd be all round the ship
before we'd had our salad.

48:43.999 --> 48:46.395
I know. The crew talks too, you know.

48:46.499 --> 48:50.991
- Go the other way. You're making me dizzy.
- It'd be better for me also.

48:52.668 --> 48:54.738
Wait a minute. Darling!

48:54.842 --> 48:56.914
Listen, darling, I...

48:58.049 --> 49:00.125
That's odd.

49:05.558 --> 49:08.255
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Is Miss McKay dining?

49:08.360 --> 49:11.966
- Yes, sir. Would you care to join her?
- No, she prefers to dine alone.

49:12.071 --> 49:14.141
She's almost finished.

49:22.158 --> 49:25.022
- Order the bouillabaisse. It's superb.
<i>- Merci mille fois.</i>

49:25.126 --> 49:27.196
<i>- Pas de quoi.</i>
- Oh, shut up.

49:46.688 --> 49:48.288
Come in.

49:48.991 --> 49:51.014
- Hello there!
- Oh, hello, Mr Hathaway.

49:51.119 --> 49:53.318
Miss McKay.

49:53.450 --> 49:55.643
Where's Ferrante?

49:55.747 --> 49:57.770
How should I know?

49:57.875 --> 50:01.229
Come now! A little bird
told me he might be in here.

50:01.333 --> 50:05.236
Really! Don't you think you're being rude?
I haven't seen Mr Ferrante...

50:05.340 --> 50:07.409
Hello, Terry.

50:09.380 --> 50:12.630
- It occurred to me you might like this book.
- I've read it.

50:14.301 --> 50:17.709
I haven't seen you for days.
I thought you must have got off.

50:17.813 --> 50:20.213
Why, no. We haven't docked anywhere.

50:23.478 --> 50:28.344
Well, in case I don't see you again,
Miss McKay, happy landing.

50:28.449 --> 50:32.598
Thank you, Mr Ferrante.
Don't think it hasn't been absolute...

50:32.702 --> 50:36.935
Now, slow down. I'm wondering
if you two would do me a big favour.

50:37.040 --> 50:40.283
- What's that?
- Would you kindly autograph these?

50:46.506 --> 50:49.120
My wife, my sister and I
each bought a different one.

50:49.224 --> 50:51.120
- You bought them?
- From whom?

50:51.224 --> 50:55.671
The ship's photographer. He has
a big display up on the promenade deck.

50:55.775 --> 50:57.841
He's doin' a wholesale business.

50:58.643 --> 51:02.339
Mr Hathaway, we'll have to think
about it. Now, where can I find you?

51:02.443 --> 51:07.056
Well, I'll either be in the cocktail lounge
or, of course, the dining room.

51:07.160 --> 51:09.061
Yes, of course.

51:17.121 --> 51:20.446
- I don't mind that one. It's pretty good.
- Do be serious.

51:20.551 --> 51:25.448
This is dreadful! And after all the pains
we took deceiving everybody.

51:25.552 --> 51:27.956
Yes. I'm particularly sorry for you.

51:30.345 --> 51:34.259
You know, I'm not as sorry as I thought I'd be.

51:35.891 --> 51:39.631
- It was rather silly, hiding like fugitives.
- Yes, I know.

51:39.735 --> 51:43.430
So, to coin a new cliché,
shall we join the others?

51:44.067 --> 51:46.053
Well, all right.

51:46.157 --> 51:48.433
Well, why not? What have we got to lose?

51:48.537 --> 51:51.483
It's the last night. Let's make the most of it.

52:02.590 --> 52:04.993
Hi, Hathaway.

52:05.097 --> 52:10.042
Do me another favour. Let's swap partners.
It's the last night out. Everybody does it.

52:10.147 --> 52:14.184
They do? How nice.
Well, in your case, we'll make an exception.

52:20.650 --> 52:22.726
I don't get that guy.

52:23.862 --> 52:26.271
<i>~ Day by day I'm growing fonder ~</i>

52:27.242 --> 52:29.856
<i>~ Of those tender things you do ~</i>

52:29.960 --> 52:31.735
Nice crossing.

52:31.839 --> 52:33.039
Hello.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.492
- Let's get some air.
- Come on. I'll show you the rudder.

52:38.596 --> 52:40.664
I'll get my coat.

52:42.842 --> 52:46.091
<i>~ May sometimes try to lure me ~</i>

52:54.645 --> 52:57.563
<i>~ Can't you think of something spiteful? ~</i>

52:58.441 --> 53:00.851
<i>~ Something mean that you could do ~</i>

53:02.449 --> 53:05.285
<i>~ Must you be so darn delightful? ~</i>

53:06.829 --> 53:08.905
<i>~ You make it easy to be true ~</i>

53:13.711 --> 53:16.119
Why can't we go on doing this for ever?

53:18.256 --> 53:21.953
- I had a talk with the captain. It won't work.
- It won't?

53:22.057 --> 53:24.460
He said he can't turn the ship around.

53:25.181 --> 53:29.798
He was nice about it, but he said most of
the people want to get home. Isn't that silly?

53:29.902 --> 53:32.047
Well, I can understand his problem.

53:32.151 --> 53:35.482
Cruising around in the ocean
with just the two of us.

53:44.160 --> 53:46.069
<i>~ You make it easy to be true ~</i>

53:52.335 --> 53:59.681
<i>~ And never brought to mind? ~</i>

53:59.781 --> 54:07.210
<i>~ Should auld acquaintance be forgot ~</i>

54:07.314 --> 54:14.570
<i>~ And days of auld lang syne? ~</i>

54:14.670 --> 54:20.121
<i>~ For auld lang syne ~</i>

54:20.752 --> 54:24.612
If you say "A penny for your thoughts"
I'll jump overboard.

54:27.375 --> 54:28.376
Well.

54:29.962 --> 54:32.038
Tomorrow morning: New York.

54:33.299 --> 54:34.299
Yes.

54:36.468 --> 54:38.544
Will he be waiting?

54:49.817 --> 54:51.617
Will she?

54:56.074 --> 54:57.674
Oh, yes.

54:58.126 --> 55:00.194
What makes life so difficult?

55:01.162 --> 55:02.562
People?

55:07.460 --> 55:09.537
Are you in love with him?

55:12.299 --> 55:14.375
I'm not now.

55:17.429 --> 55:20.963
You know, I've never done
a day's work in my whole life.

55:21.067 --> 55:23.554
I know. I've been thinking about that.

55:26.193 --> 55:28.513
- What'd you say?
- I didn't say anything.

55:28.617 --> 55:30.688
- Yes, you did.
- What?

55:32.491 --> 55:36.064
You said I was very fond of expensive things,

55:36.168 --> 55:39.940
furs and diamonds and stuff like that.

55:40.044 --> 55:42.792
- Did I say that?
- Pink champagne.

55:43.752 --> 55:46.866
That's the kind of life
we've both been used to.

55:46.970 --> 55:49.668
It might be a little difficult to...

55:51.135 --> 55:53.343
Do you <i>like</i> beer?

55:54.223 --> 55:56.223
Different.

55:57.184 --> 56:00.102
My father drank beer. In the morning.

56:00.813 --> 56:02.889
He was a beer drinker?

56:04.191 --> 56:06.517
Later in the day, he drank anything.

56:13.158 --> 56:16.777
Winter must be cold
for those with no warm memories.

56:19.583 --> 56:21.741
We've already missed the spring.

56:22.460 --> 56:25.627
Yes. This is probably my last chance.

56:26.927 --> 56:28.727
Mine too.

56:31.015 --> 56:33.092
It's now or never.

56:33.935 --> 56:36.058
Never is a frightening word.

56:37.480 --> 56:40.565
We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by.

56:42.444 --> 56:46.977
- And just because you haven't...
- Worked? Doesn't mean to say I couldn't.

56:47.082 --> 56:49.188
No, of course not.

56:49.292 --> 56:51.354
Suppose I...

56:51.458 --> 56:54.528
It'll take some time,
say six months, to find out if...

56:54.632 --> 56:56.821
- If? If what?
- Well, just suppose...

56:56.925 --> 56:58.993
- Now, be realistic.
- All right.

57:00.129 --> 57:04.175
If I worked hard enough
and long enough, say for six months,

57:05.385 --> 57:07.461
where would you be?

57:08.513 --> 57:10.755
What are you trying to say, Nickie?

57:12.309 --> 57:16.723
I just want to be...
worthy of asking you to marry me.

57:19.316 --> 57:21.937
Nickie, that's just about the nicest...

57:24.237 --> 57:26.269
Your voice cracked.

57:26.373 --> 57:28.987
- That's because I...
- Yes, I know.

57:31.829 --> 57:33.905
I'm going to turn in now.

57:34.543 --> 57:40.049
Do some more rolling and tossing
and thinking about it.

57:41.511 --> 57:43.669
Let me tell you in the morning.

57:46.266 --> 57:48.342
It's going to be a long night.

57:50.353 --> 57:52.428
For me too.

57:58.695 --> 58:02.186
Marriage is a very serious step
for a girl like me.

58:02.290 --> 58:04.358
Yes, I know.

58:12.043 --> 58:15.044
- Do you like children?
- Yes, I do.

58:38.487 --> 58:41.934
- I was so worried that...
- I didn't even have time to get dressed.

58:42.038 --> 58:46.238
- I didn't get to sleep until five!
- I didn't sleep at all.

58:46.342 --> 58:52.410
Now, listen carefully. If everything goes right,
and I mean for both of us, in six months...

58:52.515 --> 58:54.538
Here. I started to write it out.

58:54.642 --> 58:56.914
Should I read it now?

58:57.018 --> 58:58.748
"Darling." That's me?

58:58.852 --> 59:03.335
"You have a date, my beloved. July 1st
at 5 o'clock." But you don't say where.

59:03.439 --> 59:07.296
- You name the place and I'll obey.
- I don't know. I can't think.

59:07.400 --> 59:09.594
The top of the Empire State Building?

59:09.699 --> 59:14.807
Oh, yes! That's perfect. It's the nearest
thing to heaven we have in New York.

59:14.911 --> 59:17.685
The 102nd floor. Don't forget
to take the elevator.

59:17.789 --> 59:19.860
No, I won't.

59:22.830 --> 59:25.618
- If things don't work out...
- Don't talk like that.

59:29.081 --> 59:32.249
- Hold the thought.
- Take care.

01:01:40.979 --> 01:01:43.055
Nickie, darling!

01:01:45.526 --> 01:01:47.308
I'm so glad to see you.

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:52.020
- I'm glad to see you. Was it a good trip?
- Not too bad. Rough in spots, but pleasant.

01:01:52.124 --> 01:01:54.192
Hold it for a picture, please.

01:01:56.578 --> 01:01:59.532
- May I have one too, please?
- Yes. How's this?

01:02:01.959 --> 01:02:04.035
May I have another one, please?

01:02:05.338 --> 01:02:07.369
That's fine. Thank you.

01:02:07.473 --> 01:02:11.930
Excuse me, I have an important appointment.

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:19.097
It's wonderful to have you back.

01:02:20.233 --> 01:02:22.513
It's wonderful to <i>be</i> back, Ken.

01:02:22.618 --> 01:02:24.686
Darling, the car's around here.

01:02:33.621 --> 01:02:36.235
- What's the matter? Shall we get going?
- Yes.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:38.325
- The car's out here.
- Good.

01:02:49.014 --> 01:02:53.972
There's something we must discuss.
Let's go in here where we can be alone.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.512
- What in the world is all this?
- Didn't I mention it?

01:02:58.616 --> 01:03:00.760
The TV people wanted me for an interview.

01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:04.559
I said yes, if they give a donation
to my favourite charity.

01:03:04.696 --> 01:03:08.436
- Do you mind? It's for a good cause.
- I wish you'd let me know.

01:03:08.541 --> 01:03:12.273
I know you! If I'd told you,
I'd never have got you off the ship.

01:03:12.378 --> 01:03:16.572
- Camera one, take close shots.
- Nickie, this is Mr Lewis, who'll interview us.

01:03:16.677 --> 01:03:19.157
- Mr Fulton Q Lewis.
- Robert.

01:03:19.261 --> 01:03:23.203
- Robert Fulton, how do you do?
- No, Robert Q Lewis. Everybody does that.

01:03:23.307 --> 01:03:27.250
You're a little late, Mr Ferrante,
and we've gotta go on the air.

01:03:27.354 --> 01:03:32.256
Just sit yourselves right down here.
I'm going to ask a few questions, and then...

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.800
What about his face? Shiny.

01:03:35.904 --> 01:03:39.056
Would you mind a little make-up?
Harry, just blot it.

01:03:39.161 --> 01:03:41.556
- I'm sorry. It'll be over soon.
- I hope so.

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:46.146
Incidentally, that white shirt.
How about that? Glares.

01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:49.235
- You don't happen to have a blue shirt?
- No, not with me.

01:03:49.339 --> 01:03:51.568
Well, look, don't worry. We'll manage.

01:03:51.672 --> 01:03:54.530
What I'm going to do is ask a few questions

01:03:54.634 --> 01:03:59.035
about how you met,
what your plans are and things like that.

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.120
Make yourselves comfortable.

01:04:01.224 --> 01:04:03.205
Five seconds, Mr Lewis.

01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:07.544
One thing. Watch the camera.
When the red light is on, you're on.

01:04:07.648 --> 01:04:09.718
Yeah? Well, it's on.

01:04:11.062 --> 01:04:15.142
Oh, hello there. Welcome to
another <i>House to House</i> programme,

01:04:16.276 --> 01:04:19.306
<i>brought to you</i>
<i>by the Benton baby-food company.</i>

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:22.987
<i>Remember, Benton's builds better babies.</i>

01:04:23.742 --> 01:04:26.738
<i>Today our cameras are in</i>
<i>the home of Miss Lois Clarke,</i>

01:04:26.842 --> 01:04:29.502
<i>heiress to one of</i>
<i>America's greatest fortunes.</i>

01:04:29.878 --> 01:04:34.705
<i>In just a moment, we'll meet Miss Clarke</i>
<i>and her fiancé, Mr Nickie Ferrante,</i>

01:04:35.008 --> 01:04:38.288
<i>and talk to them about</i>
<i>their wonderful romance,</i>

01:04:38.392 --> 01:04:41.878
<i>which has gotten headlines</i>
<i>in papers all over the country,</i>

01:04:41.982 --> 01:04:47.467
<i>a romance which has captured the</i>
<i>imagination of the whole world. But first...</i>

01:04:47.571 --> 01:04:49.638
Do you think they're in love?

01:04:50.774 --> 01:04:52.844
I wouldn't know, Gladys.

01:04:52.948 --> 01:04:55.141
I can't wait to see that Nickie Ferrante.

01:04:55.246 --> 01:05:01.193
I don't know what the 64 million dollar
question was, but he's got the answer.

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:05.407
Point killer.

01:05:08.044 --> 01:05:10.120
Terry, darling.

01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:24.002
Remind me to ask you later
why your kisses don't seem quite the same.

01:05:24.107 --> 01:05:26.972
Maybe you're just out of practice... I hope.

01:05:28.189 --> 01:05:30.680
We don't need that darn thing on, do we?

01:05:37.203 --> 01:05:41.237
You haven't changed yet.
I thought I gave you plenty of time to...

01:05:41.341 --> 01:05:44.989
Ken, we have so much to talk about.

01:05:45.093 --> 01:05:48.004
I can just think better in this outfit.

01:05:49.424 --> 01:05:53.830
You know, darling, I hoped
the trip would be good for you, but...

01:05:53.934 --> 01:05:56.375
I'm afraid you don't look so well.

01:05:56.479 --> 01:05:59.259
What's the matter? Was it a rough crossing?

01:06:01.436 --> 01:06:03.762
Yes. It was a little.

01:06:05.274 --> 01:06:08.221
You know, Ken, that programme
might have been amusing.

01:06:08.326 --> 01:06:11.902
Lois Clarke and Nickie Ferrante
were about to come on.

01:06:13.909 --> 01:06:17.566
- I'm not interested, but if
it'll entertain you... - Yes, it will.

01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:18.670
OK.

01:06:23.377 --> 01:06:26.822
<i>You must have had some</i>
<i>wonderful experiences in Europe.</i>

01:06:26.926 --> 01:06:29.098
<i>Yes.</i>

01:06:29.198 --> 01:06:31.577
<i>Would you care to expand that statement?</i>

01:06:31.681 --> 01:06:33.681
<i>No.</i>

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:39.888
I forgot Ferrante was on
the same boat with you, wasn't he?

01:06:40.311 --> 01:06:43.019
- Yes, he was.
- Did you meet him?

01:06:45.779 --> 01:06:47.855
Was he charming?

01:06:50.868 --> 01:06:52.944
Fascinating?

01:06:56.374 --> 01:06:58.450
Irresistible?

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.960
I'm sorry.

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:04.917
It wasn't like me. I withdraw that remark.

01:07:06.884 --> 01:07:12.584
<i>Well, tell me, Mr Ferrante, is this</i>
<i>your first experience with connubial bliss?</i>

01:07:12.689 --> 01:07:15.352
<i>Would you mind rephrasing the question?</i>

01:07:16.687 --> 01:07:20.511
<i>He means, is this your first</i>
<i>experience with marriage?</i>

01:07:20.615 --> 01:07:22.816
<i>Yes.</i>

01:07:22.922 --> 01:07:29.072
<i>Good. Do you intend to support</i>
<i>your wife in the manner to which...</i>

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.781
<i>Yes.</i>

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:34.566
- That's very funny.
<i>- Doing what?</i>

01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:37.582
<i>I'm going to begin to paint again.</i>

01:07:38.335 --> 01:07:41.669
<i>That's how I intend to support my wife.</i>

01:07:43.382 --> 01:07:46.751
<i>That's certainly going to</i>
<i>take an awful lot of paint.</i>

01:07:49.888 --> 01:07:52.840
<i>You already have a house</i>
<i>full of masterpieces.</i>

01:07:52.944 --> 01:07:55.763
<i>Yes, we have. I didn't realise you were going...</i>

01:07:55.867 --> 01:07:59.098
<i>- I'm still going to paint.</i>
<i>- Oh, really?</i>

01:07:59.203 --> 01:08:03.517
<i>- I just thought you'd given all that up.</i>
<i>- I know, but I shouldn't have.</i>

01:08:03.622 --> 01:08:08.232
<i>- Well, I'm sure Nickie has all kinds of plans.</i>
<i>- Yes, I have.</i>

01:08:08.337 --> 01:08:11.858
<i>Well, good.</i>
<i>When are you going to be married?</i>

01:08:11.962 --> 01:08:15.320
<i>- We're going to be married as soon as...</i>
<i>- Just a moment, dear.</i>

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:17.625
<i>In six months.</i>

01:08:18.464 --> 01:08:21.916
"Six months"! I'll bet
she never gets him to the altar.

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.337
<i>Six months? Well, good.</i>

01:08:28.442 --> 01:08:31.886
<i>Thank you so much, Miss Clarke,</i>
<i>and you too, Mr Ferrante.</i>

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:34.886
<i>Well, folks, that winds up our interview...</i>

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:36.189
Terry.

01:08:39.404 --> 01:08:42.072
I'd like to ask that question again.

01:08:43.741 --> 01:08:46.149
Did you find Ferrante irresistible?

01:09:00.971 --> 01:09:03.298
Oh, Ken, I'm sorry.

01:09:04.475 --> 01:09:08.094
You don't plan these things.
They just happen.

01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:11.758
Darling, it just doesn't make sense.

01:09:11.862 --> 01:09:13.890
I know. I know it doesn't.

01:09:13.995 --> 01:09:17.520
- You've got to be realistic.
- About love?

01:09:18.448 --> 01:09:23.232
- You know what everyone says about him.
- Yes, I know.

01:09:23.336 --> 01:09:25.783
What are you going to do?

01:09:26.957 --> 01:09:29.359
I don't know, Ken.

01:09:29.464 --> 01:09:34.667
I think I'll go back to Boston
and try and get a job or something,

01:09:34.841 --> 01:09:36.911
singing again, until he can...

01:09:37.015 --> 01:09:39.374
Until he what?

01:09:39.478 --> 01:09:42.296
Darling, he'll never be able to support you.

01:09:42.401 --> 01:09:44.930
Terry, listen to me. I want to marry you.

01:09:45.853 --> 01:09:47.801
I should have asked you long ago.

01:09:47.906 --> 01:09:52.225
It's my fault, but it's not too late, is it?
It can't be too late.

01:09:52.901 --> 01:09:55.222
Terry, look at me.

01:09:55.326 --> 01:09:57.397
Can't you see I'm in love?

01:10:01.327 --> 01:10:02.927
So am I.

01:10:34.365 --> 01:10:36.481
Do you think you can sell it?

01:10:36.585 --> 01:10:38.897
Of course I'll try.

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:42.864
- You did this without a model?
- Yeah, I couldn't afford one.

01:10:44.127 --> 01:10:47.035
What is it? Something
wrong with my memory?

01:10:47.139 --> 01:10:49.206
It's getting a trifle dim.

01:10:49.716 --> 01:10:50.717
No!

01:10:51.769 --> 01:10:55.130
- And this?
- That's from memory. That was my lunch.

01:10:58.517 --> 01:11:01.463
- You know it's a woman?
- Yes.

01:11:01.567 --> 01:11:04.260
You mean you wouldn't care
to be seen with her?

01:11:04.364 --> 01:11:08.763
I doubt it. You know, Nickie,
if you would let me tell people -

01:11:08.867 --> 01:11:13.894
by people, I mean women - who painted
this, I could sell it and plenty more.

01:11:13.999 --> 01:11:16.525
No, no. The old Ferrante is dead.

01:11:16.629 --> 01:11:20.614
But signing "Rossi" don't mean a thing.
If you use your own name...

01:11:20.719 --> 01:11:24.543
The old Ferrante is dead
and the new Rossi is starving.

01:11:24.882 --> 01:11:28.161
What do you expect in three months?

01:11:28.266 --> 01:11:31.677
Remember, the brush obeys your hand.

01:11:32.349 --> 01:11:35.545
It doesn't know you are accustomed
to getting your own way.

01:11:35.649 --> 01:11:39.593
You are spoiled.
But the brush doesn't know this.

01:11:40.147 --> 01:11:42.187
He cannot humour you.

01:11:42.567 --> 01:11:45.431
I know. But I was hoping
you'd sell something.

01:11:45.535 --> 01:11:49.768
I want the thrill of earning that first dollar.
Oh, well. I'll have to get a job.

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:52.731
What? And give up painting?

01:11:52.835 --> 01:11:57.613
I'm not giving up. It's the only thing I know.
But I've got to earn a lot of money - quickly.

01:11:57.717 --> 01:12:00.573
Of course! In the meantime,
I'll buy you lunch.

01:12:00.677 --> 01:12:02.741
You can repay me when you're famous.

01:12:02.845 --> 01:12:06.453
That's the first encouraging thing you've said.

01:12:06.557 --> 01:12:13.349
Isn't that extraordinary? Wouldn't you
think that's the one thing I could remember?

01:12:15.144 --> 01:12:16.944
Oh, well.

01:12:20.065 --> 01:12:23.722
<i>~ You'll be walkin' on clouds ~</i>

01:12:23.826 --> 01:12:27.270
<i>~ You'll forget every care ~</i>

01:12:27.375 --> 01:12:33.906
<i>~ And your troubles like bubbles will vanish ~</i>

01:12:35.044 --> 01:12:38.444
<i>~ In air ~</i>

01:12:47.848 --> 01:12:50.129
<i>~ Close your eyes ~</i>

01:12:50.233 --> 01:12:52.046
<i>~ Make a wish ~</i>

01:12:52.150 --> 01:12:57.051
<i>~ And you're there ~</i>

01:12:57.151 --> 01:13:01.581
<i>~ Close your eyes ~</i>

01:13:01.681 --> 01:13:03.731
<i>~ Make a wish ~</i>

01:13:04.242 --> 01:13:09.643
<i>~ And you're there ~</i>

01:13:29.935 --> 01:13:32.889
I have got news. I sold one of your women.

01:13:33.858 --> 01:13:36.434
You know, the one with the...

01:13:37.239 --> 01:13:39.646
I got $200 for her.

01:13:40.534 --> 01:13:42.610
Your first dollar.

01:13:44.454 --> 01:13:49.444
- What's the matter with you?
- My friend, I'm a happy man. I am a painter.

01:13:49.548 --> 01:13:54.335
So what? I've been a painter
for years, but I ain't happy.

01:14:02.681 --> 01:14:04.797
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:04.901 --> 01:14:08.884
This is my last night, so I would
love to sing a song for you

01:14:08.988 --> 01:14:11.057
that is very close to my heart.

01:14:15.779 --> 01:14:20.980
<i>~ Our love affair ~</i>

01:14:21.417 --> 01:14:26.864
<i>~ Is a wondrous thing ~</i>

01:14:26.964 --> 01:14:35.213
<i>~ That we'll rejoice in remembering ~</i>

01:14:36.134 --> 01:14:45.835
<i>~ Our love was born with our first embrace ~</i>

01:14:45.935 --> 01:14:50.846
<i>~ And a page was torn ~</i>

<i>~ Out of time and space ~</i>

01:14:56.657 --> 01:15:01.528
<i>~ Our love affair ~</i>

01:15:01.628 --> 01:15:06.554
<i>~ May it always be ~</i>

01:15:06.654 --> 01:15:11.185
<i>~ A flame to burn ~</i>

01:15:11.285 --> 01:15:16.329
<i>~ Through eternity ~</i>

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:21.072
<i>~ So take my hand ~</i>

01:15:21.172 --> 01:15:26.560
<i>~ With a fervent prayer ~</i>

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:31.060
<i>~ That we may live ~</i>

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:36.054
<i>~ And we may share ~</i>

01:15:37.035 --> 01:15:41.576
<i>~ A love affair ~</i>

01:15:41.676 --> 01:15:45.816
<i>~ To remember ~</i>

01:15:50.386 --> 01:15:55.188
<i>~ A love affair ~</i>

01:15:57.103 --> 01:16:01.503
<i>~ To remember ~</i>

01:16:15.997 --> 01:16:19.110
- Did you fasten your seat belt?
- It's fastened.

01:16:19.215 --> 01:16:21.611
There's the Empire State Building.

01:16:21.715 --> 01:16:23.716
Thank you.

01:16:33.516 --> 01:16:37.508
Miss McKay, my dear -
my favourite customer. Welcome back.

01:16:37.612 --> 01:16:40.007
- Thank you.
- Miss Webb, look who's back.

01:16:40.112 --> 01:16:44.899
We were just saying "Whatever happened
to Miss McKay?" and here you are.

01:16:46.071 --> 01:16:50.356
- How nice you're looking.
- Yes, I know. I didn't get it here.

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:53.526
- Where you been these past months?
- In Boston.

01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:56.862
- We've missed you.
- Thank you. I've missed you too, Miss...

01:16:56.966 --> 01:16:59.030
- Lane.
- Yes, Miss Lane.

01:16:59.135 --> 01:17:01.789
I want something very, very special for...

01:17:01.894 --> 01:17:04.998
Miss Webb will be happy
to take care of you, Miss McKay.

01:17:05.102 --> 01:17:08.126
Excuse me, I have something
to do in the office.

01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:11.675
Of course, I'd be most happy
to take care of you.

01:17:12.853 --> 01:17:17.843
- Now, what did you have in mind?
- Something irresistible, inexpensive,

01:17:17.947 --> 01:17:21.932
- and pink.
- But of course. We have it.

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:25.315
The most beautiful.
I've been hiding it just for you.

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:30.996
Give Miss McKay anything she wants,
but keep talking to her until I get there.

01:17:31.498 --> 01:17:36.161
- That's all we wanted to know.
- Fine. Were you worried about her credit?

01:17:37.046 --> 01:17:39.122
I'm surprised at you! Goodbye.

01:17:43.886 --> 01:17:46.796
- This is adorable.
- It's a little short, isn't it?

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:48.672
- With these.
- Oh, no.

01:17:48.777 --> 01:17:51.546
But, look. This is a must.

01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:55.594
Yes, it's lovely, but I just
want the little item I decided on.

01:17:56.274 --> 01:17:59.554
- All right, we'll send it.
- I'll have to let you know where,

01:17:59.658 --> 01:18:01.973
because I'm not quite sure.

01:18:02.078 --> 01:18:05.563
- I believe that's right.
- No charge?

01:18:05.668 --> 01:18:06.668
No.

01:18:08.958 --> 01:18:11.663
I know, I know, but... no.

01:18:13.297 --> 01:18:15.783
- Ken!
- Terry, how are you?

01:18:15.887 --> 01:18:18.753
What are you doing here?
How did you know I...

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:22.421
I see. Nice doing business with you.

01:18:24.182 --> 01:18:26.585
Forgive me, Ken. I'm terribly late.

01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:29.556
- What time is it?
- It's five minutes to five.

01:18:30.397 --> 01:18:34.432
- It's been good seeing you, Ken.
- And you. There's so much to talk about.

01:18:34.536 --> 01:18:37.473
- Sorry. I'm in such a hurry.
- Can't we have a cocktail?

01:18:37.577 --> 01:18:40.102
- I really am in a hurry.
- I've so much to say to you.

01:18:40.207 --> 01:18:45.273
Why don't you give me a call some... You
can't do that either, cos I'm getting marr...

01:18:45.377 --> 01:18:48.486
- You're getting married?
- Yes, I am and I'm very late.

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:50.737
- What time was it?
- Four minutes to five.

01:18:50.842 --> 01:18:52.912
Goodbye, Ken.

01:18:54.049 --> 01:18:58.122
I really hope you find happiness,
and if you're ever in need of anything,

01:18:58.226 --> 01:19:01.460
like someone to love,
don't hesitate to call me.

01:19:01.564 --> 01:19:03.709
No. No, I won't.

01:19:03.813 --> 01:19:06.215
- Goodbye, Ken.
- Goodbye. Good luck.

01:19:11.233 --> 01:19:16.657
What a state I'm in! I thought the Empire
State Building was this way, and it's that way.

01:19:23.917 --> 01:19:26.576
I think I'll get out here cos I'm in a hurry.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:29.700
- Here you are. Keep the change.
- What's the rush, lady?

01:19:29.804 --> 01:19:34.536
I'm going to be married. I want you to be
the first to congratulate me. Thank you.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.795
Marriage is somethin' to rush to?

01:19:53.490 --> 01:19:55.566
102nd floor.

01:20:03.752 --> 01:20:05.828
- Going down?
- No, thank you.

01:20:21.186 --> 01:20:22.386
Tower.

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:34.312
- Going down?
- No. What time have you?

01:20:34.416 --> 01:20:36.488
Ten after five.

01:21:03.568 --> 01:21:07.770
I know what I'm doing. I want my own way.

01:21:07.874 --> 01:21:10.184
Turn the boat around.

01:21:10.289 --> 01:21:12.657
I want to turn the boat around.

01:21:14.497 --> 01:21:17.450
Nickie, help me turn the boat around.

01:21:19.042 --> 01:21:24.285
Well, you're so much stronger than I am.
I can't do it alone. I can't.

01:21:26.175 --> 01:21:29.924
- You must be quiet now.
- But I need him.

01:21:30.638 --> 01:21:32.628
Oh, Nickie, I need you.

01:21:32.732 --> 01:21:37.603
Help me! Help me turn the boat around.

01:21:39.276 --> 01:21:41.077
I must...

01:22:13.521 --> 01:22:15.597
Going down?

01:22:23.782 --> 01:22:27.438
Her X-rays aren't encouraging.
It's hard to say if she'll walk again.

01:22:27.543 --> 01:22:29.605
We won't know for a long while.

01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:31.780
That's bad.

01:22:33.041 --> 01:22:36.488
I guess you've gathered I'm not
the man she was screaming about.

01:22:36.592 --> 01:22:38.951
She was on her way to marry him.

01:22:39.055 --> 01:22:41.376
- Does he know of her condition?
- No.

01:22:45.472 --> 01:22:49.546
She said, until you know what you say
you won't know for a while,

01:22:49.651 --> 01:22:51.714
she'd rather he didn't know.

01:22:51.818 --> 01:22:54.011
She seems nice.

01:22:54.115 --> 01:22:56.183
I think so.

01:22:57.319 --> 01:22:59.387
She wants to see you.

01:22:59.492 --> 01:23:01.563
Go ahead. I'll be in shortly.

01:23:06.286 --> 01:23:08.983
- Hello, Ken.
- Hello, Terry.

01:23:09.088 --> 01:23:12.571
I told her I didn't know whether
or not she'd be with us today.

01:23:12.676 --> 01:23:14.743
Fooled you, Father.

01:23:16.714 --> 01:23:19.040
Ken, I told Father McGrath about us.

01:23:22.596 --> 01:23:25.875
He's going to find me a job.
Aren't you, Father?

01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:31.895
- You'd better get well first, Terry.
- He's right. Then I'll try and find something.

01:23:32.481 --> 01:23:34.557
Take it easy.

01:27:48.183 --> 01:27:49.921
- Miss McKay.
- Yes?

01:27:50.026 --> 01:27:53.427
I wanna thank you for what
you're doin' for my son, Tyrone.

01:27:53.531 --> 01:27:56.010
Now he won't grow up to be a mug like me.

01:27:56.114 --> 01:27:58.346
You're too modest, Mr Bugsy.

01:27:58.451 --> 01:28:02.775
No, I ain't. I'm so stupid, I ain't even ignorant.

01:28:03.826 --> 01:28:08.481
- Thanks again.
- Thank Father McGrath. He got me the job.

01:28:08.586 --> 01:28:10.657
Thanks, Father.

01:28:14.962 --> 01:28:20.411
All eyes on me, please. As you know, poor
Molly has the measles, so I'll sing her part.

01:28:20.515 --> 01:28:22.752
Now, are we ready?

01:28:27.646 --> 01:28:29.722
Well, <i>now</i> we're ready.

01:28:30.524 --> 01:28:32.980
Watch me closely. We mustn't goof today.

01:32:09.726 --> 01:32:10.726
Well!

01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:13.620
Come in.

01:32:15.398 --> 01:32:19.349
Nickie! I'm so happy to see you. Come in.

01:32:19.862 --> 01:32:22.808
- How's my severest critic?
- Oh, well, we'll see.

01:32:22.913 --> 01:32:26.573
I see you've got them all arranged.
Let me hear the worst.

01:32:26.828 --> 01:32:30.274
Six months' work.
You haven't wasted your time, Nickie.

01:32:30.379 --> 01:32:33.820
Thank you. You should have seen
the 50 I dropped over the cliff.

01:32:33.925 --> 01:32:37.910
- Maybe you should have dropped this one.
- I'm inclined to agree with you.

01:32:38.014 --> 01:32:42.623
You know, I can read your state of mind
when you painted this.

01:32:42.727 --> 01:32:45.712
You were very sorry for yourself
when you painted this one.

01:32:45.816 --> 01:32:47.882
That one was painted in August.

01:32:49.602 --> 01:32:52.965
You were angry here.
You were getting over your broken heart.

01:32:53.069 --> 01:32:55.805
Broken heart? That stuff's not for me.

01:32:55.909 --> 01:32:58.518
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Let's get down this end.

01:32:58.622 --> 01:33:01.107
I'm coming to that. I'm coming to that.

01:33:04.372 --> 01:33:07.823
Here, Nickie, you became a painter.

01:33:08.542 --> 01:33:12.073
Thank you. I'm not exactly
ashamed of that one myself.

01:33:12.177 --> 01:33:15.285
I had a great deal to say -
and I painted it instead.

01:33:15.389 --> 01:33:20.175
Your being away, alone, for a long time
has given you that grasp of...

01:33:21.222 --> 01:33:24.419
I'll get it. Remember where you were.
I want to hear more.

01:33:24.523 --> 01:33:27.721
Hello. Courbet's Paint and Varnish Store.

01:33:28.605 --> 01:33:31.892
Nickie? I read you arrived today.

01:33:32.151 --> 01:33:35.651
Lois! How nice.
How did you know I was here?

01:33:36.072 --> 01:33:39.147
I called your hotel.
They said you were on this number.

01:33:39.251 --> 01:33:45.079
Nickie, I've been thinking about you morning,
noon and night, and in-between times too.

01:33:45.833 --> 01:33:48.240
I was wondering if maybe you could...

01:33:49.794 --> 01:33:51.194
Well...

01:33:51.504 --> 01:33:56.297
No, I like the idea all right - it's a nice offer.
But I can't make it this afternoon.

01:33:57.052 --> 01:34:00.671
Well, if you can't do that... I wish you would.

01:34:03.809 --> 01:34:07.432
Thanks anyway.
Nicest thing that's happened today.

01:34:08.527 --> 01:34:10.852
But you could make the show tonight.

01:34:11.530 --> 01:34:15.187
I'll leave a ticket at the box office anyway.
Do try to make it.

01:34:15.291 --> 01:34:17.270
And, Nickie...

01:34:17.375 --> 01:34:21.320
Whatever you do, don't plan
anything for <i>after</i> the show, huh?

01:34:50.447 --> 01:34:53.439
- I love our seats.
- What?

01:34:53.543 --> 01:34:55.609
I said "I love our seats."

01:35:21.942 --> 01:35:24.683
- We enjoyed it very much.
- Thank you for asking us.

01:35:24.787 --> 01:35:28.990
It was a pleasure. If you don't mind,
Mr Ferrante will see me home.

01:35:29.533 --> 01:35:31.609
Good night.

01:35:34.955 --> 01:35:39.445
- Where would you like to go?
- Suppose you decide. This is your evening.

01:35:39.549 --> 01:35:42.906
I've been away so long,
I have no idea where people go.

01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:44.611
My coat.

01:35:56.854 --> 01:35:58.055
Hello.

01:36:18.376 --> 01:36:20.824
Terry. Please let me tell him.

01:36:20.928 --> 01:36:21.928
No.

01:36:23.426 --> 01:36:26.464
- I'll go get him.
- No, no, please.

01:36:29.684 --> 01:36:32.004
It's pretty rough.

01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:36.053
The first time you're able to get out,
you have to run into him.

01:36:37.067 --> 01:36:40.400
And all I could say was... "Hello."

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.941
Well, the show's over.

01:36:48.045 --> 01:36:50.112
The boy got the girl. Shall we go?

01:36:55.169 --> 01:36:57.246
I'll only be a minute.

01:37:19.861 --> 01:37:21.849
Good night, Lois, and thank you.

01:37:21.953 --> 01:37:26.149
Taking you to a show tonight
wasn't a very good idea, was it?

01:37:26.253 --> 01:37:30.111
- Merry Christmas, Lois.
- Merry Christmas, Nickie, and...

01:37:30.832 --> 01:37:32.912
<i>auf Wiedersehen.</i>

01:38:04.538 --> 01:38:09.830
I think it's terrible to have to take you home
just when everyone else is going out.

01:38:12.631 --> 01:38:14.919
<i>C'est la vie.</i> Et cetera.

01:38:16.844 --> 01:38:19.669
Terry, let me ask you again.

01:38:19.773 --> 01:38:21.833
Why won't you let me help you?

01:38:21.938 --> 01:38:25.211
All right, then, I will tell you again.

01:38:25.315 --> 01:38:29.344
If you paid for my getting well,
he wouldn't like it, so I wouldn't like it.

01:38:29.448 --> 01:38:33.014
Then if you did get me well
and I went to him, <i>you</i> wouldn't like it.

01:38:33.119 --> 01:38:36.390
- But certainly he ought to know.
- No! If he found out,

01:38:36.494 --> 01:38:40.482
he'd insist upon doing it himself -
if he had the money, which I doubt.

01:38:40.586 --> 01:38:44.321
And then, if I didn't get well... that'd be awful.

01:38:44.426 --> 01:38:50.118
No. Unless I can walk to him, and when I say
"walk" I mean "run", he'll never know.

01:38:50.222 --> 01:38:53.956
Well, I'm fine. I've got my job
and I'm on a budget.

01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:58.043
And if things come out right,
and then maybe if I'm a very good girl,

01:38:58.148 --> 01:39:01.556
I'll get what I want <i>next</i> Christmas. Follow?

01:39:26.005 --> 01:39:28.036
Merry Christmas.

01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:30.208
How are you feeling, Miss McKay?

01:39:31.384 --> 01:39:34.136
Children, I have bad news for you.

01:39:35.013 --> 01:39:37.682
Doctor won't let me go with you.

01:39:39.142 --> 01:39:41.923
Doctor, I could be back in a couple of hours.

01:39:42.027 --> 01:39:44.341
This is the Christmas benefit.

01:39:44.445 --> 01:39:47.643
This is their first public appearance.
This is my team.

01:39:47.901 --> 01:39:51.357
- She's our coach, Doc.
- Norman! "Doctor."

01:39:52.869 --> 01:39:54.946
She's our coach, Doctor.

01:39:56.248 --> 01:39:59.111
If it wasn't good for her,
would you want her to go?

01:39:59.216 --> 01:40:00.216
No.

01:40:01.512 --> 01:40:05.033
Well, look. Why don't you
try it without me, hm?

01:40:05.137 --> 01:40:08.578
Come on. The only thing
that would bother you would be the start.

01:40:08.682 --> 01:40:11.049
- Miss McKay?
- Yes, Tyrone?

01:40:11.847 --> 01:40:16.381
We'll be thinking about you while we sing,
hoping that you'll be around real soon.

01:40:16.485 --> 01:40:18.553
Thank you, Tyrone.

01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:24.763
Wait a minute. Where's Sally?
Isn't she with us today?

01:40:24.867 --> 01:40:29.147
- We took her off. She sings too loud.
- She's a show-off.

01:40:29.251 --> 01:40:34.200
Sally thought it was a joke,
and she wanted so badly to go on the stage.

01:40:35.874 --> 01:40:37.950
Come here, darling.

01:40:38.126 --> 01:40:40.195
You go up on the stage with the others.

01:40:40.299 --> 01:40:45.162
I'll put you back on the team, but you must
promise not to drown out the other children.

01:40:45.266 --> 01:40:46.917
All right, Miss McKay.

01:40:47.343 --> 01:40:49.208
- Are we ready?
- Yes.

01:40:49.313 --> 01:40:51.313
All right.

01:42:21.201 --> 01:42:26.242
- You're going to do all right without me.
- All right, children. We must go now.

01:42:28.833 --> 01:42:31.319
- Merry Christmas.
- God bless you.

01:42:31.423 --> 01:42:33.495
Be good, now.

01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:42.925
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, darling.

01:42:46.937 --> 01:42:49.467
This isn't going to be
much of a Christmas for you.

01:42:49.572 --> 01:42:52.556
- I'll be all right.
- There we are.

01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:54.683
- Could just hand me my...
- Yes, surely.

01:42:54.787 --> 01:42:56.854
Thank you so much.

01:42:57.698 --> 01:43:01.605
You're welcome to have turkey
with my husband and me.

01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:05.736
- You save a drumstick for me for later.
- All right, I will.

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.656
And if there's anything else
you want, just holler.

01:43:08.761 --> 01:43:11.948
Thank you so much. I will.
It's very sweet of you.

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:15.466
- Merry Christmas.
- And a Merry Christmas to you too.

01:43:16.722 --> 01:43:19.177
Does Miss McKay...

01:43:30.194 --> 01:43:32.269
Hello, Terry.

01:43:34.782 --> 01:43:37.356
It's... good to see you.

01:43:38.286 --> 01:43:40.362
It's good to see you too.

01:43:41.372 --> 01:43:46.028
- You feeling all right?
- Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm just resting.

01:43:46.132 --> 01:43:47.132
Good.

01:43:49.007 --> 01:43:52.127
- It's been a long time.
- Yes, hasn't it?

01:43:54.596 --> 01:43:57.043
Well, it is good to see you.

01:43:57.147 --> 01:43:59.338
You said that.

01:43:59.442 --> 01:44:01.925
- May I...
- Oh, yes. Please do sit down.

01:44:05.148 --> 01:44:09.561
- I'll only be a minute. Sure you don't mind?
- No, of course not.

01:44:11.655 --> 01:44:14.406
Oh, is this the breathtaking view?

01:44:15.575 --> 01:44:18.328
Well, the altitude bothered me.

01:44:26.675 --> 01:44:29.592
Well, I'll bet you're wondering how I got here.

01:44:30.388 --> 01:44:32.464
Well, yes. Yes, I am.

01:44:34.392 --> 01:44:39.047
I was looking through a telephone book
for a man named McBride

01:44:39.152 --> 01:44:42.342
and I came across the name "T McKay".

01:44:42.447 --> 01:44:47.269
I said to myself "Could that
possibly be Terry McKay, my old friend?"

01:44:48.531 --> 01:44:51.282
- And it was.
- Yes.

01:44:52.243 --> 01:44:57.483
And then I said to myself "Well, now,
I haven't been very nice to Miss McKay."

01:44:57.588 --> 01:45:03.456
"After all, I had an appointment
with her one day, and I didn't keep it."

01:45:05.508 --> 01:45:07.539
You didn't keep...

01:45:07.643 --> 01:45:08.643
No.

01:45:12.349 --> 01:45:16.882
So I said to myself -
I talk to myself quite a lot these days -

01:45:16.986 --> 01:45:20.968
I said "That's not a very nice way
to treat an old friend like Miss McKay."

01:45:21.073 --> 01:45:23.346
"I must apologise to Miss McKay."

01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:28.266
Don't you agree, when someone doesn't
keep an appointment, they should apologise?

01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:31.488
Yes. I think you're absolutely right.

01:45:33.041 --> 01:45:39.329
I think the least people could do
is to say they're sorry, or... something.

01:45:41.008 --> 01:45:43.084
So here I am.

01:45:44.136 --> 01:45:47.422
- That's very sweet.
- I thought so.

01:45:49.974 --> 01:45:54.176
I've often wondered about you.
And how you were.

01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:56.347
Did you really?

01:45:57.066 --> 01:45:59.466
Yes, really.

01:46:00.319 --> 01:46:02.940
Well, I've often thought about you too.

01:46:03.947 --> 01:46:07.229
Then you weren't angry
because I wasn't there?

01:46:07.333 --> 01:46:09.570
I mean, you must have been at first.

01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:12.190
Well...

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.076
Yes, I was.

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:18.495
At first I was furious.

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:21.840
I said "He can't do this to me.
Who does he think he is?"

01:46:22.968 --> 01:46:26.005
How long did you wait?
I mean, did you wait long?

01:46:27.807 --> 01:46:30.087
Well, let's... well, yes.

01:46:30.191 --> 01:46:32.670
Yes, I waited until about...

01:46:32.774 --> 01:46:34.575
Midnight.

01:46:37.609 --> 01:46:40.181
And then what did you do?

01:46:40.286 --> 01:46:42.952
Well, then I got really mad.

01:46:43.869 --> 01:46:48.449
- You can imagine, standing up there on the...
- Yes, in a thunderstorm.

01:46:50.252 --> 01:46:52.375
In a thunderstorm?

01:46:54.464 --> 01:46:57.455
Then what did you say to yourself?

01:46:57.559 --> 01:47:00.957
Then I said "I'll go on home and get tight."

01:47:01.062 --> 01:47:03.457
- But you didn't do that.
- Didn't I?

01:47:03.561 --> 01:47:08.924
No. Well, maybe just a little one,

01:47:09.028 --> 01:47:11.097
every hour, for about a month.

01:47:11.982 --> 01:47:14.937
- Can you blame me?
- I should say not.

01:47:15.528 --> 01:47:18.808
The least I could have done
was to have sent you a note.

01:47:18.913 --> 01:47:23.147
Perhaps, by the time you thought of it,
you didn't know where to reach me?

01:47:23.251 --> 01:47:26.985
But you swore that if you ever
saw me again, you'd ask.

01:47:27.090 --> 01:47:28.090
No.

01:47:29.467 --> 01:47:33.327
I remember we said that if
we could make it, we'd be there.

01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:39.416
And if one of us didn't show up,
it would be for a darn good reason.

01:47:40.387 --> 01:47:44.084
- Did we say that?
- Yes, that is exactly what we said.

01:47:44.188 --> 01:47:48.971
- Well, like what, for instance?
- So, there will be no more questions asked,

01:47:49.075 --> 01:47:50.476
I hope?

01:47:54.281 --> 01:47:56.479
Would you like a cigarette?

01:47:56.583 --> 01:47:58.584
Thank you.

01:47:58.750 --> 01:48:00.821
Thank <i>you,</i> Nickie.

01:48:04.626 --> 01:48:08.575
Isn't that wonderful?
I walked all the way here just to...

01:48:10.089 --> 01:48:14.218
And now I'm not even supposed
to ask you why you weren't there.

01:48:16.012 --> 01:48:18.249
Isn't it strange?

01:48:18.353 --> 01:48:21.378
We used to read each other's thoughts.

01:48:21.482 --> 01:48:23.553
It's not the same, is it?

01:48:24.188 --> 01:48:26.189
Not quite.

01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:31.515
- It doesn't seem...
- I know.

01:48:31.619 --> 01:48:34.484
I don't know what happens
to me whenever I...

01:48:36.576 --> 01:48:38.652
No wedding ring, I see.

01:48:39.955 --> 01:48:40.955
No.

01:48:41.923 --> 01:48:44.869
- I thought at the...
- Last night, the show?

01:48:45.502 --> 01:48:48.337
No, no. He was just...

01:48:49.464 --> 01:48:50.464
No.

01:48:52.969 --> 01:48:56.251
I didn't mean to offend you.

01:48:56.355 --> 01:48:59.259
How's everything with you, Nickie?

01:48:59.364 --> 01:49:02.272
Oh, you can ask questions!

01:49:04.526 --> 01:49:08.222
I thought everything was fine
until I saw you last night.

01:49:08.327 --> 01:49:13.477
Then I knew there must be <i>something</i>
between us, even if it's only an ocean.

01:49:13.581 --> 01:49:15.653
So I bought myself a ticket.

01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:19.952
Oh, you're sailing?

01:49:20.793 --> 01:49:22.393
Tonight.

01:49:24.797 --> 01:49:27.917
- And you're happy, aren't you?
- Yes.

01:49:28.968 --> 01:49:31.128
- And you?
- I don't know.

01:49:31.263 --> 01:49:34.211
I'm worried about the future,
and what people will think.

01:49:34.315 --> 01:49:39.886
They'll say "There's the mad painter. What's
the matter with him? He doesn't like women."

01:49:39.991 --> 01:49:43.638
- Why would people say that?
- Because he sails the seven seas,

01:49:43.742 --> 01:49:49.267
and to every woman he meets, he says
"Where will you be in six months?"

01:49:49.372 --> 01:49:51.435
- And they're there?
- Everywhere.

01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:56.734
Tops of pyramids, domes of cathedrals, the
Eiffel Tower. He tries to keep them up high.

01:49:56.839 --> 01:49:59.861
He keeps them waiting.

01:49:59.966 --> 01:50:02.036
And where is he all this time?

01:50:05.010 --> 01:50:06.611
Waiting.

01:50:07.646 --> 01:50:09.881
But you can't go on like that.

01:50:10.683 --> 01:50:15.634
It isn't right for you.
I wish I could say you were wrong.

01:50:15.739 --> 01:50:17.939
I was once.

01:50:20.152 --> 01:50:23.847
- How would you like to change the subject?
- Yes, I'd love to.

01:50:23.951 --> 01:50:27.446
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, I almost forgot.

01:50:29.453 --> 01:50:34.570
Six months ago, who'd have thought
we'd be spending Christmas together?

01:50:34.674 --> 01:50:36.743
I brought you a present.

01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:43.708
Thank you. I'm sorry I don't have one for you.

01:50:43.812 --> 01:50:47.000
I didn't think I'd be seeing you.

01:50:47.104 --> 01:50:52.554
That's all right, I didn't expect one.
That isn't really a Christmas present.

01:51:02.113 --> 01:51:04.438
Oh, that's why my letters came back.

01:51:12.666 --> 01:51:17.166
I would have sent it to you,
but I didn't know your address until today.

01:51:19.844 --> 01:51:22.596
She wanted you to have it, remember?

01:51:24.975 --> 01:51:28.426
So... that's the reason I...

01:51:40.491 --> 01:51:42.567
Goodbye, Terry.

01:51:44.286 --> 01:51:46.362
Goodbye, Nickie.

01:52:07.478 --> 01:52:10.219
You know, I painted you
like that, with the shawl.

01:52:10.323 --> 01:52:14.359
I wish you could have seen it.
Courbet said it was one of my best.

01:52:15.361 --> 01:52:21.525
I didn't think I could ever part with it, but
there was no reason to keep it any longer.

01:52:21.629 --> 01:52:25.568
I couldn't take money for it
because, well, you know...

01:52:25.672 --> 01:52:31.540
So Courbet told me a young woman
came into the gallery and... she liked it.

01:52:31.799 --> 01:52:36.711
She saw in it what I'd hoped you'd see, so...
I told Courbet to give it to her.

01:52:37.848 --> 01:52:42.592
Because he said she didn't have
any money, and not only that, she was...

01:52:45.438 --> 01:52:47.438
She was...

01:52:49.317 --> 01:52:52.059
Anyway, I told him to give it to her.

01:52:52.163 --> 01:52:54.768
Courbet said she wanted it so badly and...

01:52:54.872 --> 01:52:58.479
So I told him to give it to her.
It's the Christmas season and all that.

01:52:58.583 --> 01:53:01.069
And you know me, holly in my heart.

01:53:34.661 --> 01:53:36.903
Darling, don't look at me like that.

01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:43.576
Why didn't you tell me?

01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:47.799
If it had to happen to one of us,
why did it have to be you?

01:53:52.679 --> 01:53:54.755
It was nobody's fault but my own.

01:53:57.352 --> 01:53:59.428
I was looking up.

01:54:00.438 --> 01:54:02.680
It was the nearest thing to heaven.

01:54:04.693 --> 01:54:06.770
You were there.

01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:10.106
Oh, darling.

01:54:10.241 --> 01:54:12.901
Don't worry, darling.

01:54:13.005 --> 01:54:15.995
If you can paint, I can walk.

01:54:16.415 --> 01:54:19.445
Anything can happen, don't you think?

01:54:19.549 --> 01:54:21.997
Yes, darling.

01:54:29.511 --> 01:54:39.869
