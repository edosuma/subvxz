00:03.836 --> 00:05.839
YOUR CLOTHES THREW UP
ON OUR STAIRCASE?

00:05.922 --> 00:09.592
- 'CAUSE IT'S WEDNESDAY.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.052
- STILL CONFUSED.

00:11.136 --> 00:12.887
- MARIE'S COMING TO CLEAN
TOMORROW.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.556
HOW'S SHE GONNA KNOW
WHAT'S DIRTY

00:14.639 --> 00:17.183
UNLESS IT'S ON THE FLOOR?

00:17.267 --> 00:18.685

STEPHANIE.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.061
YOU'LL CATCH ON.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.647
- UH, JAMES,
WHAT DO WE DO WITH OUR CANS

00:22.731 --> 00:23.982
WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH THEM?

00:24.065 --> 00:25.817
- OH, RIGHT.

00:28.153 --> 00:31.322
HMM, THAT HAD A COUPLE
SWALLOWS LEFT.

00:31.406 --> 00:32.907
EH, MARIE WILL GET IT.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.034
- YOU CAN'T JUST
LEAVE THAT THERE.

00:35.118 --> 00:35.493
WE'LL GET BUGS.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.455
- SWEET.

00:38.538 --> 00:41.374
- STOP THAT.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.835
- WHAT, BUGS DON'T LIKE JUICE?

00:43.918 --> 00:46.713
- NO, YOU'RE MAKING A MESS.

00:46.796 --> 00:49.799
AND SINCE WHEN IS IT MARIE'S JOB
TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOU?

00:49.883 --> 00:52.051
- SINCE SHE TOOK A JOB
WITH A CLEANING SERVICE?

00:52.135 --> 00:53.887
IS THIS A TRICK QUESTION?

00:55.138 --> 00:56.139
- HERE.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.640
YOU GUYS DON'T GET TO BE SLOBS

00:57.724 --> 00:59.517
JUST BECAUSE THE CLEANING
SERVICE IS COMING.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.894

YOU DO.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.855
- I DO NOT.
NAME ONE TIME.

01:03.938 --> 01:04.772
- DINNER DISHES LAST WEDNESDAY.

01:04.855 --> 01:08.234
- NAME TWO TIMES.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.612
- I CLEAN UP AFTER MYSELF,
STEPHANIE.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.864
- SWEETIE, STUFFING YOUR
DIRTY TOWELS UNDER YOUR BED

01:12.947 --> 01:14.282
DOES NOT COUNT.

01:14.365 --> 01:16.159
- HOW'S MARIE GONNA
KNOW THEY'RE DIRTY

01:16.242 --> 01:19.162
UNLESS THEY'RE UNDER MY BED?

01:19.245 --> 01:21.831
- WE HAVE A SYSTEM.
DON'T MESS IT UP.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.917
- YOU GUYS LIVE LIKE PIGS.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.669
- ONLY ON WEDNESDAYS.
THAT'S THE SYSTEM.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.338
- UNBELIEVABLE.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.048
I WAS RAISED TO TAKE PRIDE
IN MY HOME.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.842

DRINKING COFFEE

01:32.926 --> 01:33.968
OUT OF THIS
ICE CREAM SUNDAE DISH?

01:34.052 --> 01:35.845
- ALL OF MY MUGS WERE DIRTY.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.847
- AND YOU COULDN'T WASH ONE?

01:37.931 --> 01:38.932
- I WOULD'VE, BUT--

01:39.015 --> 01:41.518
- BUT MARIE'S COMING TOMORROW.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.353
- HOW IS SHE GONNA
KNOW THEY'RE DIRTY

01:43.436 --> 01:45.480
UNLESS I LEAVE THEM

02:19.472 --> 02:22.058
{\an8}IT'S A BAD IDEA TO HAVE
A CLEANING SERVICE?

02:23.434 --> 02:24.894
{\an8}I'D REMEMBER YOU SAYING THAT,

WITH THAT.

MYSELF TAUGHT ME RESPONSIBILITY.

TOLD YOU SOMETHING.

03:29.292 --> 03:32.462
- AARON, SWEETIE,

03:32.545 --> 03:33.671

JUST GO GET A SNACK.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.665

ALL WEEKEND.

04:50.748 --> 04:53.543
- THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SO
BUSY TAKING PRIDE IN OUR HOME.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.797
- I BET DAD AND STEPH
JUST FIRED THE CLEANING SERVICE

04:57.880 --> 04:59.841
SO THEY COULD MAKE US WORK
FOR FREE.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.134

05:01.217 --> 05:01.884
IF THEY WANT US TO BE
THE CLEANING SERVICE,

05:01.968 --> 05:03.886
THEY SHOULD PAY US.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.138
- GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.974
- IF WE ALL STOP WORKING,
WHAT COULD THEY DO?

05:08.057 --> 05:09.851
THEY COULD CLEAN THE HOUSE
THEMSELVES,

05:09.934 --> 05:11.394
THEY COULD HIRE THE SERVICE,

05:11.477 --> 05:13.855
OR THEY COULD PAY US
WHAT WE DESERVE.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.315
IT'S A WIN-WIN-WIN.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.735

ALL RIGHT, I'M IN.

THROWING THINGS,

05:21.988 --> 05:23.489

AS MY HUMAN SHIELD.

DOWN, THE OTHER CORNER POPS UP.

- CHARLIE, THOSE ARE
THE WRONG SIZE.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.517
THEY'RE NOT EVEN OUR SHEETS.
OUR SHEETS ARE TURQUOISE.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.853

- THOSE ARE AQUAMARINE.

05:53.936 --> 05:57.732
- I HATE THIS HOUSE.

05:57.815 --> 06:00.693
YOU JUST HAD TO GO
AND FIRE THE CLEANING SERVICE.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.780
- YOU KNOW, WE CAN GO BACK AND
FORTH ABOUT WHOSE FAULT THIS IS.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.115
- OH, NO, NO.
THERE IS NO BACK OR FORTH.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.743
IT'S YOUR FAULT.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.578

BECAUSE I WAS RIGHT.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.958

HERE NOR THERE.

- OH, IT'S HERE.
- STOP IT.

06:21.672 --> 06:22.965

THE CLEANING PEOPLE BACK.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.967

06:27.428 --> 06:29.097
YOU'RE TRYING TO TEACH
THE KIDS SOMETHING.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.099
THE LEAST I CAN DO
IS BACK YOU UP.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.642
- NO, REALLY.
I CAN BEND HERE.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.810
- NO, HONEY,
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO--

06:33.893 --> 06:36.395
- PLEASE, CHARLIE,
IF YOU EVER LOVED ME,

06:36.479 --> 06:38.481
STOP SUPPORTING ME
ON THIS.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.825
- WHAT ABOUT
WHAT'S BEST FOR THE CHILDREN?

06:48.908 --> 06:52.703
- WHO CARES ABOUT THEM?
WE GOT NICE STUFF.

06:52.787 --> 06:56.958
I SAY WE GIVE THEM REASONABLE,
HARMLESS CHORES.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.335
MAKE UP THEIR BEDS,
TAKE OUT THE TRASH,

06:59.418 --> 07:01.629
AND DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING
THAT MATTERS.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.422
- HMM, WELL, LET'S DO THAT.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.883
BUT I WISH YOU HADN'T FIRED HER

07:05.967 --> 07:08.553
WITHOUT TALKING TO ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.430
I JUST HOPE MARIE IS...
STILL AVAILABLE.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.100
- YOU ALREADY CALLED HER,
DIDN'T YOU?

07:14.183 --> 07:16.060
- SHE'LL BE BACK ON THURSDAY.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.775
- OH, GOOD.
YOU GUYS ARE HERE.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.027
- YEAH.
WE'RE CALLING A FAMILY MEETING.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.864
- CAN THEY DO THAT?

07:27.947 --> 07:30.950
- FOR THE LAST WEEK, WE'VE BEEN
DOING MOST OF THE HOUSEWORK.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.703
- WELL, WE WERE JUST COMING
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.580
- THIS IS OUR MEETING.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.626
- AND WE HAVE SOME DEMANDS.

07:40.710 --> 07:41.878
- OH, DO YOU, NOW?

07:41.961 --> 07:43.212
- HECK, YEAH, WE DO.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.173
WE WANT TO BE PAID
TO CLEAN THE HOUSE.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.551
- AND I WANT PEOPLE NOT TO LAUGH
WHEN I WEAR A MOCK TURTLENECK.

07:48.634 --> 07:52.013
- YOU GUYS PAID MARIE,
SO YOU SHOULD PAY US.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.723
EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.434
- WHAT HE SAID!

07:56.517 --> 07:59.020
- GUYS, WE ARE NOT GONNA
PAY YOU.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.938
BUT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
REALLY HARD,

08:01.022 --> 08:03.858
SO LET'S GO GET OUR COATS
AND GO OUT FOR SOME PIZZA.

08:03.941 --> 08:06.819
- PIZZA?
WE DID IT, MAN! WE WON!

08:08.613 --> 08:10.031
- WE DIDN'T WIN.

08:10.114 --> 08:12.700
DAD AND STEPHANIE ARE TRYING
TO AVOID THE ISSUE.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.744
- PAY US,
OR WE'RE GOING ON STRIKE.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.330
- A STRIKE?
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT STRIKES?

08:17.413 --> 08:19.540
- I'M STUDYING THEM IN SCHOOL.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.335
- I KNEW IT WAS A MISTAKE
TO EDUCATE THEM.

08:22.418 --> 08:25.880
- CLASSIC MANAGEMENT PROPAGANDA.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.590
STRIKE! STRIKE!
STRIKE! STRIKE!

08:27.673 --> 08:30.051

STRIKE! STRIKE! STRIKE!

08:30.134 --> 08:31.093
STRIKE! STRIKE!

08:31.177 --> 08:34.138
- FINE, STRIKE.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.474
SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR TV,
YOUR INTERNET,

08:36.557 --> 08:39.143
AND ALL YOUR OTHER
LITTLE COMFORTS.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.852
- WORKS FOR US.
- YEAH.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.938
- AND IF WE DON'T CARE ABOUT
THAT STUFF,

08:43.022 --> 08:45.024
THEN YOU'VE GOT NOTHING ON US.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.361
- I KNOW THEY CAN'T DO THAT.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.779
- GUYS, STOP IT.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.698

NOT NEED TO HAPPEN, OKAY?

YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE
COME UP WITH A COMPROMISE

08:54.825 --> 08:56.410
WE THINK YOU'LL
ALL BE HAPPY WITH.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.246
WE'RE GOING TO REHIRE
THE CLEANING SERVICE,

08:58.329 --> 09:00.414
BUT YOU STILL HAVE
TO DO SOME CHORES.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.375
- NO WAY.
NO CHORES.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.293
- AND NO CLEANING SERVICE.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.420
I'M RE-CANCELLING.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.632
IF YOU LIVE IN THE HOUSE,
YOU CLEAN THE HOUSE.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.592
- THEN WE DON'T NEED
YOUR HOUSE.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.435
- FINE.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.646
THEN LET'S SEE HOW YOU DO
WITHOUT IT.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.362
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.658
- WELL, THIS TOOK A TURN.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.035
- REMEMBER THAT WIN-WIN-WIN?

09:38.119 --> 09:39.829
SOMEHOW, WE LOST.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.747
- TRUST ME, WE GOT 'EM
RIGHT WHERE WE WANT 'EM.

09:41.831 --> 09:46.419
- WHERE, INSIDE WITH THE TV
AND MY PHONE?

09:46.502 --> 09:47.670
- WOW.

09:47.753 --> 09:51.507
WHOLE LOT OF CRAZY
JUST WENT DOWN, AM I RIGHT?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.050
WE'RE GONNA LAUGH
ABOUT THIS TOMORROW.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.344
LET'S JUST GO INSIDE
AND HAVE A PIECE OF CAKE.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.013
- WE ALL KNOW THERE'S NO CAKE.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.848
WE WERE JUST IN THERE
TWO MINUTES AGO.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.433
- MAYBE SHE JUST MADE IT.

10:00.516 --> 10:03.269
- AARON, THIS ISN'T ABOUT CAKE.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.145
WE CAN GET CAKE ANYTIME.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.522
- I WANT CAKE NOW.

10:06.605 --> 10:09.066
- ANY TIME BUT NOW.
FOCUS.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.401
- COME ON, GUYS.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.236
JUST COME IN
AND TALK TO YOUR DAD.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.156
THIS CAN ALL BE SOLVED
WITH A SIMPLE CONVERSATION.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.866
WE WERE SO CLOSE
TO A COMPROMISE.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.826
- WE'RE NOT ANYWHERE NEAR
A COMPROMISE.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.036
- YEAH, YOU JUST WANT US
IN THERE

10:20.119 --> 10:23.622
SO YOU CAN HANDCUFF US
TO THE VACUUM CLEANER.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.666
- DAD KNOWS WHAT WE WANT.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.834
CAKE.
RIGHT, GUYS?

10:29.003 --> 10:29.754
- STOP WITH THE CAKE.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.006
WE WANT PAY FOR THE WORK WE DO

10:32.089 --> 10:33.924
AND BACK PAY
FOR THE WORK WE'VE DONE.

10:34.008 --> 10:34.633
PLUS PENSION AND HEALTH.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.180
- UNTIL THEN,
HE KNOWS WHERE TO FIND US.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.389
- THAT'S RIGHT.

10:40.473 --> 10:44.477
LIVING IN THIS BACKYARD
NEXT TO THIS RED ANTHILL.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.362
- WOULD YOU JUST GO OUTSIDE
AND TALK TO THEM?

10:54.445 --> 10:55.821
- NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.908
UNTIL THEY MAKE THE BED,
THEY DON'T LIE IN IT.

10:58.991 --> 11:02.119
- CHARLIE, YOU'VE GOT TO BE
THE GROWN-UP HERE.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.955
- I JUST WANT THEM TO CLEAN
THE HOUSE THAT I PROVIDE,

11:05.039 --> 11:06.749
AND BE GRATEFUL
FOR THE PRIVILEGE.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.460
AND IF THEY WANT TO TALK,
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE,

11:09.543 --> 11:13.255
EATING HOT BUTTERY POPCORN AND
WATCHING MY NEW FAVORITE SHOW,

11:13.339 --> 11:15.174
<i>ALL MY CHILDREN FREEZING.</i>

11:21.013 --> 11:22.932
I CAN MAKE MORE POPCORN.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.850
I CAN MAKE MORE CHILDREN.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.605
- MORNING, GUYS.

11:29.688 --> 11:30.231
HOW'D YOU SLEEP?

11:30.314 --> 11:32.775
- LET'S JUST SAY

11:32.858 --> 11:36.112
WE DIDN'T GET FAR ENOUGH
AWAY FROM THAT RED ANTHILL.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.780
- HERE, I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.616
- WHAT'S THAT, A BOX
FULL OF DAD'S APOLOGIES?

11:40.699 --> 11:43.285
- NO, SOME CLOTHES TO WEAR
TO SCHOOL TODAY.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.412
- THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE

11:44.495 --> 11:46.288
BUT OLD CHRISTMAS OUTFITS
AND PAJAMAS.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.998
- WHY CAN'T WE WEAR THE STUFF
IN OUR CLOSETS?

11:48.082 --> 11:51.043
- YOUR DAD INSISTS YOU DON'T
WEAR ANYTHING WE BOUGHT,

11:51.127 --> 11:53.963
SO THAT LEAVES JUST PRESENTS
FROM YOUR GRANDPARENTS.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.006
YOU WANT TO STAND ON PRINCIPLE,

11:56.090 --> 11:57.967
YOU'LL DO IT IN SNORKELING FINS.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.138
- FOR REAL?

12:02.221 --> 12:03.973
- MY OLD HALLOWEEN COSTUME!

12:04.056 --> 12:06.642
B-BAM!

12:06.725 --> 12:08.811
- PERSONALLY,
I'D JUST END THE STRIKE,

12:08.894 --> 12:11.272
GO IN, AND PUT ON SOMETHING
LESS MORTIFYING.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.107
- ARE WE REALLY GONNA
WEAR THIS STUFF TO SCHOOL?

12:13.190 --> 12:16.902
- IF WE BREAK NOW, DAD WILL
NEVER TAKE US SERIOUSLY AGAIN.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.321
- YEAH, AND THE NEXT TIME
WE'RE IN THE TOY STORE,

12:19.405 --> 12:21.490
I NEED HIM TO FEEL ME.

12:27.496 --> 12:28.998
- HEY, BABE.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.167
- HEY.
YOU LOOK TIRED.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.294
12 HOURS AT THE HOSPITAL,
YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED.

12:33.377 --> 12:34.503
- OH, I AM.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.671
BY MY THIRD OPERATION,

12:35.754 --> 12:37.506
I WANTED TO SWITCH PLACES
WITH THE PATIENT.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.884
AT LEAST HE GOT TO LIE DOWN.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.928
OH, HELLO, SWEET COUCH.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.638
DID YOU MISS ME?

12:46.098 --> 12:47.516
- DO YOU FEEL RESTED YET?

12:47.600 --> 12:50.269
BECAUSE I NEED YOU TO DUST
AND VACUUM OUR BEDROOM.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.937
- ME?

12:52.021 --> 12:54.523
- YES, YOU.
THE KIDS ARE ON STRIKE.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.276
I CAN'T TAKE CARE
OF THIS WHOLE HOUSE BY MYSELF.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.195
- YEAH--NO, I'LL DO IT TOMORROW.

12:59.278 --> 13:02.364
- YOU HAVE SURGERY AGAIN
ALL DAY TOMORROW.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.115
- THEN I'LL DO IT ON SATURDAY.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.534
- GOOD.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.537
HERE'S A LIST OF ALL THE OTHER
THINGS I NEED YOU TO DO.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.873
WHEN CAN YOU MOP
THE LAUNDRY ROOM?

13:10.956 --> 13:13.876
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT--A LIST?
WHY IS THERE A LIST?

13:13.959 --> 13:16.003
- BECAUSE WE HAVE
THE WORK OF FIVE PEOPLE

13:16.086 --> 13:17.046
TO SPLIT BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.757
- [sighs]
"CLEAN ALL THE BATHROOM"--

13:19.840 --> 13:22.843
DO I HAVE TO DO THIS?

13:22.927 --> 13:24.011
- WE HAVE SHOWER CRUD.

13:24.094 --> 13:26.347
- I DON'T WANT TO TOUCH
SHOWER CRUD.

13:26.430 --> 13:30.184
- WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
DOESN'T WANT TO COMPROMISE.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.728
- [chuckles]
FINE.

13:32.811 --> 13:36.232
I GIVE.
I'LL TALK TO THE KIDS.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.574
- THIS WAS THE WORST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.577
AND I'M A CHILD OF DIVORCE.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.038
- TOUGH DAY IN THOSE
ELF SLIPPERS, HUH?

13:51.121 --> 13:52.915
- IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.042
MOLLY WAS GONNA BRING ME SOME
NORMAL CLOTHES TO CHANGE INTO,

13:55.125 --> 13:58.295
BUT SHE HAD TO GO
AND GET STREP THROAT.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.339
CAN YOU BELIEVE HER?

14:01.465 --> 14:04.677
ANYWAY, I CAVE.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.637
I'LL CLEAN ANYTHING YOU WANT.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.014
- GOOD.
WE HAVE SHOWER CRUD.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.017
- BEST DAY EVER!

14:15.980 --> 14:17.940
PEOPLE GAVE ME CANDY
BECAUSE I LOOK LIKE HALLOWEEN.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.777
- YOU'RE IN THE HOUSE.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.279
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE NOT
ON STRIKE EITHER?

14:23.362 --> 14:25.197
- NO WAY.
I'M STILL ON STRIKE.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.991
-<i> TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES</i>
IS ALMOST ON.

14:27.074 --> 14:31.120
- I'M OFF STRIKE.
NOBODY TOUCH THE TV.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.831
I'M GONNA GO CHANGE
INTO MY TURTLE COSTUME.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.501
- JAMES MUST HAVE GONE STRAIGHT
TO THE BACKYARD.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.461
I'M GONNA GO GET HIM
SO WE CAN WORK OUT A COMPROMISE.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.297
- NO LONGER INTERESTED.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.840
- WHAT?

14:42.923 --> 14:44.425
- NOW I'M WINNING.

14:44.508 --> 14:47.845
TWO KIDS DOWN,
ONE KID TO GO.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.430
- YOU WON'T GET JAMES.

14:49.513 --> 14:50.598
HE SAYS YOU'RE READY TO BREAK

14:50.681 --> 14:53.267
LIKE A STREET DANCER
ON A REFRIGERATOR BOX.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.146
- OH, I'M GONNA BREAK?

14:57.229 --> 14:59.982
HE'S GONNA BREAK!

15:00.065 --> 15:03.694
HE'S GONNA BREAK LIKE
A REFRIGERATOR BOX...

15:03.777 --> 15:05.237
ON RECYCLING DAY.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.905
YEAH, I SAID IT!

15:08.365 --> 15:10.618
- YOU KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE
THE SAME VEIN IN YOUR FOREHEAD

15:10.701 --> 15:14.246
THAT THROBS WHEN YOU GET MAD?

15:14.330 --> 15:16.832
- CHARLIE, YOUR SON
IS IN THE BACKYARD ALL ALONE.

15:16.915 --> 15:19.835
YOU COULD END THIS RIGHT NOW.

15:19.918 --> 15:22.046
- YOU GOT IT, HONEY.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.841
I'LL END IT.

15:25.924 --> 15:27.051
I'LL END IT GOOD.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.768
- JAMES, YOUR FATHER IS READY
TO COMPROMISE.

15:35.851 --> 15:39.813
- SO I WON?
-<i> COMPROMISE.</i>

15:39.897 --> 15:41.940
NOBODY WINS.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.734
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE LOSING.

15:43.817 --> 15:46.528
- JAMES, YOUR DAD IS INSIDE

15:46.612 --> 15:47.738
HOPING YOU GUYS CAN
FIND A WAY OUT OF THIS.

15:47.821 --> 15:51.367
YOU CAN END THIS
RIGHT NOW.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.786
- YOU GOT IT, STEPH.

15:53.869 --> 15:54.578
I'LL END IT.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.498
I'LL END IT GOOD.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.711
- WHY DO YOU GUYS
KEEP SAYING IT LIKE THAT?

16:04.797 --> 16:07.549
HONEY, JAMES IS STILL OUT THERE.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.468
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
TALK TO HIM.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.387
- I WENT A DIFFERENT WAY.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.850
- I'M BORED. WHEN DO I GET
TO PLAY WITH JAMES?

16:16.934 --> 16:18.227
- NO, NO, NO.
I TOLD YOU.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.062
YOU'RE NOT HERE
TO PLAY WITH JAMES.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.022
YOU'RE HERE TO PLAY JAMES.

16:26.276 --> 16:28.404
THAT'S YOUR SEAT.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.490
- I--I'M SORRY.
WHAT?

16:31.573 --> 16:34.451
- I HIRED HIM TO REPLACE JAMES
UNTIL THE STRIKE ENDS.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.286
HUH? HUH?

16:36.370 --> 16:39.039
- THAT'S YOUR MOVE?
YOU BROUGHT IN A SCAB JAMES?

16:44.128 --> 16:46.630
- OH, YOU'RE WRONG FOR THAT.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.215
[doorbell rings]

16:48.298 --> 16:50.008
- I TOLD YOU I WAS GONNA END IT,

16:50.092 --> 16:51.760
AND SCAB JAMES WILL END IT.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.263
- YOUR MOVE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

16:54.346 --> 16:56.724
FINDING A COMPROMISE
WITH YOUR SON.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.142
- BUT THIS IS BETTER.

16:58.225 --> 17:00.477
LIKE YOU SAID,
HE'S OUT THERE ALL ALONE.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.770
ONCE HE SEES
HIS REPLACEMENT IN HERE

17:01.854 --> 17:03.981
ENJOYING ALL THE THINGS
HE WISHES HE WERE ENJOYING,

17:04.064 --> 17:06.942
A LITTLE DUSTING
WON'T SEEM SO BAD.

17:07.025 --> 17:09.944
- OH, I GET
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.029
- HMM?

17:11.113 --> 17:13.531
- YOU'VE TURNED INTO
A CRAZY PERSON.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.659
OH, HEY, MRS. MEHARRY.

17:15.742 --> 17:18.162
- HELLO, MRS. PHILLIPS,
DOCTOR.

17:18.244 --> 17:20.955
THESE ARE POSTED ALL OVER
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

17:21.039 --> 17:23.416
- "MY FATHER,
DR. CHARLES PHILLIPS,

17:23.500 --> 17:25.627
MAKES ME LIVE IN THE BACKYARD."

17:30.674 --> 17:31.800
- BOLD MOVE.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.178
- I ASSURE YOU, MRS. MEHARRY,

17:34.261 --> 17:38.015
THAT WHAT'S ON THIS FLYER
IS NOT TECHNICALLY TRUE.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.808
- I'LL BE OUT BACK
VISITING JAMES.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.894
ARE WE ALLOWED TO FEED HIM YET?

17:41.977 --> 17:44.521
- YES.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.566
- MAYBE I'LL HOLD ON TO THIS
JUST IN CASE.

17:49.318 --> 17:52.112
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
JAMES WOULD DO SOMETHING

17:52.196 --> 17:53.155
SO DRASTIC AND OUTRAGEOUS.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.658
- CAN I HAVE A SODA
WITH DINNER?

17:56.742 --> 17:58.827
- NOT NOW, SCAB JAMES.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.375
I THINK I GOT ALL THE FLYERS.

18:07.503 --> 18:12.216
BOY, THAT MRS. MEHARRY CAN GET
SCRAPPY WHEN SHE GETS CORNERED.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.342
- CHARLIE, I'VE BEEN
THINKING THIS OVER.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.636
- HMM.

18:15.719 --> 18:16.804
- IF YOU CAN'T END THIS THING
WITH JAMES,

18:16.887 --> 18:18.806
I'M GONNA GO ON
A LITTLE STRIKE OF MY OWN.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.849
- WHAT KIND OF STRIKE
COULD YOU POSSIBLY GO ON?

18:22.851 --> 18:24.186
STRIKE'S OVER!
GET THAT KID IN HERE.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.896
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

18:25.979 --> 18:27.105
[doorbell rings]

18:27.189 --> 18:28.774
- ALREADY ON IT.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.947
- [squeaks]

18:35.030 --> 18:36.406
- BOLD MOVE.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.825
- HE'S OUT BACK.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.535
- YOU WANT ME TO GO
RIGHT TO BALLOONS,

18:39.618 --> 18:42.037
OR SHOULD I DO SOME KNOCK-KNOCK
JOKES WITH THE GOOSE?

18:42.120 --> 18:43.455
- IT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.666
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL
BE OUT THERE THAT LONG.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.335
- OKAY, BUT WE GOT
A TWO-HOUR MINIMUM.

18:51.630 --> 18:52.714
- CLOWNS AND JAMES.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.883
OH, YOU'RE GOOD.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.636
- OH, IS JAMES AFRAID OF CLOWNS?

18:57.719 --> 19:00.556
THAT'S GONNA MAKE THE BACKYARD
FEEL VERY SMALL.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.182
[toy horn honks]

19:02.266 --> 19:04.309
- [screaming]

19:09.857 --> 19:12.025
- ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.695
I GOT YOU TO
THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.405
NOW, TALK.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.410
- [clears throat]
I'M SORRY.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.371
- [clears throat]
ME TOO.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.833
- GOOD.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.418
NOW WE'VE GOT A DIALOGUE GOING.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.545
NOW, MY ORIGINAL SUGGESTION
WAS THAT--

19:31.628 --> 19:34.298
- OKAY, DAD.
I GUESS WE COULD DO SOME CHORES,

19:34.381 --> 19:36.925
LIKE, KEEP OUR ROOMS CLEAN,
MAYBE TAKE OUT THE TRASH.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.928
- WELL, IF YOU GUYS DO THAT,

19:40.012 --> 19:42.598
THEN I'M PREPARED TO REHIRE
THE CLEANING SERVICE

19:42.681 --> 19:43.891
TO DO THE HEAVY WORK.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.350
- WHICH IS WHAT I HAD SAID
IN THE FIRST--

19:45.434 --> 19:47.102
- I'LL HAVE TO TAKE IT
BACK TO MY PEOPLE,

19:47.185 --> 19:49.313
BUT I BET I COULD
SELL IT TO 'EM.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.109
- THEN WE HAVE A DEAL.

19:54.192 --> 19:56.403
YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD WE HAD
THIS TALK, SON.

19:56.486 --> 19:57.571
- ME TOO, DAD.

19:57.654 --> 20:01.283
- AH, I KNEW WE COULD
REACH A COMPROMISE.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.076
[laughter]

20:03.160 --> 20:06.038
- THAT WAS MY COMPROMISE
BEFORE THIS EVEN STARTED.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.624
- HONEY, YOU GOT US TALKING.
DON'T BE A CREDIT HOG.

20:10.709 --> 20:11.793
- I BET WE'D HAVE
GOTTEN HERE SOONER

20:11.877 --> 20:15.297
IF IT WEREN'T FOR
ALL OF YOUR ANTICS.

20:15.380 --> 20:19.676
- YEAH, YOU COULD'VE JUST
ASKED US TO TALK TO EACH OTHER.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.637
- BUT--BUT--BUT I TOLD YOU--

20:21.720 --> 20:23.805
AND HE SAID THAT--
AND YOU--

20:23.889 --> 20:26.642
FOR REAL?

20:28.810 --> 20:30.854
both: WOMEN.
