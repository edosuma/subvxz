00:44.118 --> 00:47.085
No one kidnaps my lieutenant
and gets away with it.

00:53.093 --> 00:55.362
Yaah!

01:06.740 --> 01:08.375
No need to flip out.

01:09.743 --> 01:11.279
Aha.

01:13.747 --> 01:15.650
Ah!

01:18.652 --> 01:21.854
Get away from her,
you big bully.

01:37.804 --> 01:41.342
Huh! Is it just me,
or is it getting hot in here?

01:44.744 --> 01:45.846
Ava?

01:48.181 --> 01:50.250
Ah!

01:55.422 --> 01:56.825
Aha.

02:08.769 --> 02:09.704
Yes!

02:15.442 --> 02:18.243
Hey, ugly.
I got a joke for you.

02:18.245 --> 02:19.447
Knock knock.

02:31.525 --> 02:33.759
- Who's there?
- Nobody anymore.

02:33.761 --> 02:36.561
Nobody anymore who?

02:36.563 --> 02:40.666
Uh, "nobody anymore who"
will hurt my best friend.

02:40.668 --> 02:44.303
I knew you'd never let those
monsters hurt me, Ava Blade.

02:44.305 --> 02:46.537
Ah! You're the best.

02:46.539 --> 02:48.606
You're not
so bad yourself, Bandit.

02:48.608 --> 02:51.309
Mmm!

02:51.311 --> 02:54.912
So next time we take
on jungle monsters,

02:54.914 --> 02:57.815
remind me to bring
my Magneto Vacuum 5000.

02:57.817 --> 02:59.517
Really?

02:59.519 --> 03:00.719
What?

03:00.721 --> 03:02.588
That joke was so bad.

03:02.590 --> 03:05.457
Come on.
Look at all the dust.

03:05.459 --> 03:07.458
That was good.

03:07.460 --> 03:08.860
It was really bad.

03:08.862 --> 03:10.428
What about
my "knock knock" joke?

03:10.430 --> 03:12.430
That was pretty good.

03:12.432 --> 03:14.732
You know what
I always say, Bandit...

03:14.734 --> 03:18.237
- Be fierce and never give up.
- Never give up!

03:23.676 --> 03:27.745
Oh! They're the best
best friends.

03:27.747 --> 03:31.416
Ooh, ooh! I cannot wait
to meet Ava Blade.

03:31.418 --> 03:33.785
I mean
Scarletta Gateau.

03:33.787 --> 03:36.387
Yes, I know
the difference.

03:36.389 --> 03:38.356
You know, <i>gateau</i>
is French for "cake,"

03:38.358 --> 03:40.458
and I love cake, so we're
basically the same person.

03:40.460 --> 03:42.628
Oh, I just adore
her movies.

03:42.630 --> 03:45.564
And she's the nicest,
sweetest person ever.

03:45.566 --> 03:48.033
- Doesn't she also run that charity?
- Yes.

03:48.035 --> 03:51.602
The charity for Love and
Adoration of Wildlife.

03:51.604 --> 03:56.340
Her last CLAW ball made every other charity
ball look like a last-minute hoedown.

03:56.342 --> 03:59.278
I can't believe
we're going to meet her.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.512
Oh, I hope Bandit
is there too.

04:01.514 --> 04:04.683
She is just the cutest little
raccoon in the history of,

04:04.685 --> 04:07.052
um, well, ever.

04:07.054 --> 04:10.689
Fun fact. Bandit's real
name is Rubie Blaze.

04:10.691 --> 04:12.724
Good thing
you said it was fun.

04:12.726 --> 04:15.893
Otherwise, I may have mistaken
it for what it actually was...

04:15.895 --> 04:17.661
a snore fact.

04:25.405 --> 04:27.773
Well, what did you
think of the movie?

04:27.775 --> 04:29.908
I really liked it.

04:29.910 --> 04:32.576
Oo-wah! Oo-wah!

04:32.578 --> 04:35.047
I liked
the "knock knock" part.

04:35.049 --> 04:38.650
The jungle bougie look
is fierce.

04:38.652 --> 04:40.751
Ah. It was okay.

04:42.022 --> 04:45.456
Cheeky, what are you
talking about?

04:45.458 --> 04:48.860
I mean,
it was a good movie.

04:48.862 --> 04:51.530
But it wasn't
Mistabella good.

04:51.532 --> 04:52.797
Mistabella?

04:52.799 --> 04:55.033
As in the multi-award
winning movie star?

04:55.035 --> 04:56.634
Uh, yeah.

04:56.636 --> 04:59.771
Only the best actor
in the world.

04:59.773 --> 05:03.908
Cheeky, maybe it's because you don't
know about Scarletta's philanthropy.

05:03.910 --> 05:05.710
None of that matters.

05:05.712 --> 05:09.614
Scarletta Gateau is the greatest
movie star in the greatest movie.

05:09.616 --> 05:11.615
Case closed.

05:11.617 --> 05:15.754
You don't think that's a little bit
of an overstatement, Donatina?

05:15.756 --> 05:19.590
I said, case closed.

05:19.592 --> 05:23.828
Well, there is only one movie star
coming to Shopville to meet her fans.

05:23.830 --> 05:25.931
Scarletta Gateau!

05:25.933 --> 05:28.066
Who's got fat toes?

05:28.068 --> 05:29.968
I do.

05:29.970 --> 05:32.037
I'm so going
to vote for her

05:32.039 --> 05:34.573
for the Ultimate Shoppies
Choice Golden Award.

05:34.575 --> 05:37.109
- She'll definitely win. - Of course.
- Love her.

05:37.111 --> 05:39.977
BT-dubs, I love that
we match Ava Blade

05:39.979 --> 05:42.114
with our little
wrist goodies.

05:42.116 --> 05:46.117
And by wrist goodies, you mean
the Cortar Series 2000 watches.

05:46.119 --> 05:48.388
Yeah, I match the most.

05:49.655 --> 05:50.989
Quick. Rainbow Kate.

05:50.991 --> 05:53.859
Take a picture of me
as Ava Blade.

05:53.861 --> 05:55.794
"Be fierce."

05:55.796 --> 05:58.129
Oh. Whoops.

05:58.131 --> 05:59.700
That's the video
call button.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.768
Hello?

06:02.770 --> 06:03.938
<i>Hello?</i>

06:05.472 --> 06:08.139
Try talking
a little louder, Peppamint.

06:08.141 --> 06:10.509
- Hello!
- Ow!

06:10.511 --> 06:12.576
Maybe try somewhere
in the middle.

06:12.578 --> 06:14.478
Did you get it?

06:16.150 --> 06:17.615
Whoops.

06:17.617 --> 06:19.417
That's not it.

06:19.419 --> 06:20.718
Take it.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.521
Ahh!

06:22.523 --> 06:23.588
Got it.

06:23.590 --> 06:24.989
Uhh!

06:24.991 --> 06:26.158
Yes!

06:26.160 --> 06:29.494
You know these Cortar
Series 2000 watches

06:29.496 --> 06:32.963
are gonna be so handy when we fight
the crowds to meet Scarletta Gateau.

06:32.965 --> 06:34.432
Yeah.

06:34.434 --> 06:36.033
They have so many features.

06:37.871 --> 06:39.470
Like an alarm clock.

06:39.472 --> 06:41.138
Ah. It's time.
She's here!

06:41.140 --> 06:43.141
She's here.
She's in Shopville.

06:43.143 --> 06:46.877
Oh, my cakeness.
I am so excited!

06:46.879 --> 06:48.913
Quick. Smart watches,
synchronize.

06:48.915 --> 06:51.783
In three, two, one.

06:51.785 --> 06:53.552
Let's do this.

06:56.957 --> 06:58.657
Ah! Ah!

06:58.659 --> 07:01.126
Ah! Ah!

07:01.128 --> 07:04.662
Um, are they
chasing someone?

07:04.664 --> 07:06.932
You think you'd know
what that looks like, Kooky,

07:06.934 --> 07:10.470
considering we chased you
all around the world once.

07:12.472 --> 07:14.872
Okay.

07:14.874 --> 07:16.874
What do you say, gang?

07:16.876 --> 07:20.145
Let's go find out what's so
great about Scarletta Gateau.

07:20.147 --> 07:22.116
Whoa!

07:25.751 --> 07:28.085
Yay.

07:28.087 --> 07:29.890
Yay.

07:32.525 --> 07:34.759
Oh, scoops.

07:34.761 --> 07:37.662
The line is massive.

07:37.664 --> 07:41.098
Why didn't the Cortar 2000 tell us
we should have gotten here earlier?

07:41.100 --> 07:44.071
I don't think it has a "foresight" feature yet.

07:49.075 --> 07:51.509
Can you see her?
How does she look?

07:51.511 --> 07:53.944
I can't see anything
except the back of your head.

07:53.946 --> 07:56.213
Well, I can't
take it off.

07:56.215 --> 07:59.518
Even though it would be the
best way to do my hair ever.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.852
Huh. I'm going
to invent that.

08:01.854 --> 08:05.557
Ah, we can't see
anything either.

08:05.559 --> 08:07.792
Uh, what are
we looking at?

08:07.794 --> 08:08.927
The limo!

08:08.929 --> 08:10.629
Why?

08:15.535 --> 08:17.802
Ohhhh.

08:17.804 --> 08:19.674
That's the lady from the movie.

08:21.575 --> 08:22.641
Wait.

08:22.643 --> 08:24.208
Is that...

08:27.813 --> 08:29.581
Height? Rubie-sized.

08:29.583 --> 08:30.948
Weight? Rubie weight.

08:30.950 --> 08:32.817
Absolutely adorable?

08:32.818 --> 08:34.618
That's Rubie Blaze!

08:34.620 --> 08:36.886
If Rubie looks over here,
I think I might...

08:38.792 --> 08:40.695
Like clockwork.

08:48.301 --> 08:51.602
Did that just happen?

08:51.604 --> 08:53.237
She looked at us.

08:53.239 --> 08:55.640
Ohh!

08:55.642 --> 08:57.909
What happened?
What did I miss?

08:57.911 --> 09:01.346
Oh, just that Scarletta basically said
come right over and be my best friends.

09:01.348 --> 09:03.848
I didn't hear any of that.

09:03.850 --> 09:05.150
I did.

09:05.152 --> 09:07.017
Look at this line.

09:07.019 --> 09:09.688
She'll have forgotten about us
by the time we meet her.

09:09.690 --> 09:12.292
We gotta get in there.

09:14.127 --> 09:15.997
I have a plan.

09:24.604 --> 09:26.203
Help! Help!

09:26.205 --> 09:28.308
Has anyone seen
a banana around here?

09:31.878 --> 09:33.814
Careful. He bites.

09:37.651 --> 09:39.117
Raaar!

09:45.325 --> 09:46.893
Raaar!

10:04.344 --> 10:06.647
Shake 'em off
and we'll see you in there.

10:07.814 --> 10:10.247
Quick!
Secure that banana!

10:10.249 --> 10:13.587
I am a dinosaur. Raaar!

10:15.989 --> 10:17.657
There he is.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.196
Raaar!

10:24.764 --> 10:26.800
Raaar!

10:27.734 --> 10:29.067
What line?

10:29.069 --> 10:32.337
That was
surprisingly easy.

10:37.377 --> 10:40.377
Oh! She's talking
to so many people.

10:40.379 --> 10:42.713
I wish I could
be brave like that.

10:42.715 --> 10:47.419
Peppamint, the only thing stopping
you from being brave is you.

10:47.421 --> 10:51.392
Yeah. Be like Ava Blade and, like,
just go talk to that cheese.

10:53.125 --> 10:54.358
Huh?

10:54.360 --> 10:57.462
Pretend you're spies
exchanging information.

10:57.464 --> 10:59.100
Okay.

11:02.101 --> 11:05.703
Uh... Um... Uh, I, uh...

11:05.705 --> 11:08.808
Be, uh...
um, fierce, uh...

11:11.210 --> 11:12.879
Uh, never give up.

11:16.282 --> 11:18.216
I'm not cut out
for this.

11:18.218 --> 11:20.017
Raaar!

11:20.019 --> 11:22.820
- Do you hear that noise?
- I'll get ya!

11:22.822 --> 11:24.389
Raaar!

11:24.391 --> 11:26.724
- I'll get ya!
- He's heading for our Scarletta!

11:26.726 --> 11:29.059
I knew it couldn't
be that easy.

11:29.061 --> 11:30.328
Raaar!

11:32.199 --> 11:34.301
Well, howdy there.

11:36.135 --> 11:37.836
How do you do?

11:37.838 --> 11:40.972
Now I dance for you.

11:45.010 --> 11:46.511
Oh, no.

11:46.513 --> 11:48.747
She's going
to be so mad.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.881
We'll never get
to meet Rubie now.

11:50.883 --> 11:52.318
I got this.

11:54.787 --> 11:57.488
This lipstick's
got charm.

11:57.490 --> 11:59.524
<i>♪ Na, na, na, na-na-na-na ♪</i>

12:01.427 --> 12:03.697
How are you today?

12:11.504 --> 12:13.203
Oh, no. Oh, no!

12:13.205 --> 12:15.473
I'm so sorry.

12:15.475 --> 12:18.108
Are you hurt,
my little friend?

12:18.110 --> 12:20.978
Oh, you're so incredibly kind.

12:20.980 --> 12:22.981
Oh, no. It's nothin'.

12:22.983 --> 12:27.054
It's just so important to take a
moment to care for those in need.

12:34.494 --> 12:35.894
Oh, dear.

12:35.896 --> 12:37.194
Are you sick?

12:37.196 --> 12:39.798
I'm allergic to raccoons.

12:42.802 --> 12:46.069
Oh, my. Well,
I recognize you.

12:46.071 --> 12:49.073
You're the cookie who the
Crown Jules was after.

12:49.075 --> 12:50.911
And Macy Macaron's muse.

12:52.244 --> 12:54.112
I say.

12:54.114 --> 12:55.847
We need
a bit of privacy.

12:55.849 --> 12:57.915
We're in the company
of celebrity.

13:05.457 --> 13:07.424
Move along.

13:07.426 --> 13:09.229
- Move along.
- Clear the field.

13:10.397 --> 13:12.329
You heard the bull!
Deer the shield!

13:12.331 --> 13:14.899
Mm, mm-mm.

13:16.202 --> 13:20.838
Gee, they've really
beefed up their security.

13:20.840 --> 13:24.007
Hang on a second.
You're the celebrity.

13:24.009 --> 13:27.444
Oh, I followed your little
caper of a world vacation,

13:27.446 --> 13:29.447
along with the rest
of the world.

13:29.449 --> 13:31.415
They love you.

13:31.417 --> 13:34.251
I just knew I needed
to meet you.

13:34.253 --> 13:37.588
Y-You wanted
to meet us?

13:37.590 --> 13:41.059
Can you guys believe
she wanted to meet us?

13:41.061 --> 13:44.462
Can you guys believe Donatina
doesn't know we can all hear her?

13:44.464 --> 13:47.966
This is perfect.
We wanted to meet <i>you.</i>

13:47.968 --> 13:52.035
Yeah. We-We-We think
you're the... the best.

13:52.037 --> 13:54.005
Especially you,
Rubie Blaze.

13:54.007 --> 13:55.272
Oh, thank you.

13:55.274 --> 13:57.942
Oh, y'all are sweet,

13:57.944 --> 14:01.011
but adoration is not
why I wanted to meet you.

14:01.013 --> 14:03.247
I need your help.

14:03.249 --> 14:07.919
You see, I get so much
attention in public now,

14:07.921 --> 14:12.122
I can't even get myself a chili hot
chocolate without being mobbed by fans.

14:12.124 --> 14:13.625
Unbelievable.

14:13.627 --> 14:15.260
I know.

14:15.262 --> 14:18.630
It's stopping me from doing
what I really love most...

14:18.632 --> 14:20.298
helping those in need.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.665
Ah.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.367
You're so selfless.

14:23.369 --> 14:26.103
And when I saw
your determination

14:26.105 --> 14:29.373
to find your friend
and clear this cookie's name,

14:29.375 --> 14:31.208
It made me realize

14:31.210 --> 14:34.945
that I needed to come
to Shopville and find you,

14:34.947 --> 14:37.615
because y'all are
the perfect fit

14:37.617 --> 14:40.418
for my charity's
next project.

14:40.420 --> 14:43.621
- Wait. You mean CLAW?
- That's the one.

14:43.623 --> 14:48.626
Y'all are gonna help me with the
CLAW Save the Shoppets campaign, TM.

14:48.628 --> 14:53.200
Maybe this will help me win that
Ultimate Shoppies Choice Golden Award.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.635
You want <i>us</i> to help you
with your charity?

14:57.637 --> 15:00.074
You betcha.

15:04.377 --> 15:05.642
Hi there.

15:05.644 --> 15:07.645
I'm Scarletta Gateau,

15:07.647 --> 15:11.516
international movie star
and generally popular Shoppie.

15:11.518 --> 15:14.151
My life was full
of film premieres,

15:14.153 --> 15:16.587
fancy parties
and glamorous trips,

15:16.589 --> 15:21.092
but deep down in my heart, I
knew there was more I could do.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.727
- The Charity for Love and Adoration of Wildlife...
- No!

15:23.729 --> 15:26.664
is dedicated to our mission
to help the less fortunate.

15:26.666 --> 15:28.198
And to date,

15:28.200 --> 15:31.272
our campaigns have brought joy
around the world.

15:34.975 --> 15:38.709
But now it's time
for our most important work yet.

15:38.711 --> 15:41.545
The sweet little
Shoppets of Pawville

15:41.547 --> 15:46.650
live in horrible conditions
and are constantly under threat.

15:46.652 --> 15:51.255
With the CLAW
Save the Shoppets campaign, TM,

15:51.257 --> 15:55.459
we are pledging to take them
away from the Pawville slums

15:55.461 --> 15:59.497
and give them
a new place to call home.

15:59.499 --> 16:01.698
Call now to find out

16:01.700 --> 16:06.205
how you too
can Save the Shoppets, TM.

16:12.378 --> 16:14.679
Seriously, you're
the kindest, best,

16:14.681 --> 16:17.381
most amazing
movie star ever.

16:17.383 --> 16:20.584
Please stop.
Y'all are making me blush.

16:20.586 --> 16:22.652
So, you're willing to help?

16:22.654 --> 16:25.223
- Of course. - Absolutely.
- My dream come true.

16:25.225 --> 16:28.192
This is fabulous news.

16:28.194 --> 16:30.594
Good acting in the video.

16:30.596 --> 16:32.729
Thank you.

16:32.731 --> 16:34.298
It was hard work
under all the...

16:34.300 --> 16:38.069
Isn't it sad to see
those poor creatures in need?

16:38.071 --> 16:40.237
Yeah, it was hard work,

16:40.239 --> 16:42.342
knowing there was still so
much we could do to save them.

16:43.575 --> 16:46.209
- Cool.
- I just have one question.

16:46.211 --> 16:49.247
Of course.
Ask me anything.

16:49.249 --> 16:51.484
Have you met Mistabella?

16:53.219 --> 16:56.420
Ixnay on
the IstabellaMay.

16:58.624 --> 17:01.726
Mistabella
and I go way back.

17:01.728 --> 17:05.194
We're wonderful friends.

17:05.196 --> 17:07.263
I'd love to meet her.

17:07.266 --> 17:09.834
Oh, of course you would.

17:09.836 --> 17:11.569
Why wouldn't you?

17:11.570 --> 17:14.405
Everyone loves Mistabella.

17:14.406 --> 17:16.772
I bet you'd even
consider voting for her

17:16.775 --> 17:19.512
in the Ultimate Shoppies
Choice Awards.

17:22.482 --> 17:23.614
Huh?

17:23.616 --> 17:26.148
What's this bull... business?

17:26.151 --> 17:28.117
A little paperwork
for the campaign.

17:28.119 --> 17:30.821
Safety. Being able to use your
image online. Blah, blah, blah.

17:30.823 --> 17:33.790
Just sign on the dotted line. Don't
bother reading the legal mumbo junk.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.526
Boring.

17:35.528 --> 17:38.328
You're going to post
about us online?

17:38.330 --> 17:39.800
Sure am.

17:44.803 --> 17:48.542
All right now, huddle up and
give me your best Ava Blade.

17:55.215 --> 17:56.280
Are we filming?

17:58.118 --> 18:01.385
- Quiet on set!
- Shh!

18:01.387 --> 18:04.390
When it comes
to saving the Shoppets...

18:05.492 --> 18:07.558
be fierce.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.527
Never give up!

18:09.529 --> 18:10.564
Uh...

18:11.898 --> 18:13.731
Great. I'll post it now.

18:13.733 --> 18:17.401
This is the best thing that
could have ever happen to me.

18:17.403 --> 18:20.808
It was only a matter of time
for me to become famous.

18:23.676 --> 18:25.909
All signed? Great.

18:25.911 --> 18:28.148
Let's go to Pawville.

18:30.817 --> 18:34.184
I'll see all y'all
little heroes tomorrow mornin'.

18:34.186 --> 18:35.621
Come on, Rubie.

18:41.793 --> 18:43.860
Ah, she's awesome.

18:43.862 --> 18:45.596
So brave.

18:45.598 --> 18:47.165
What a leader.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.834
Yeah, I'm gonna save
all the Shoppets.

18:49.836 --> 18:52.172
Wait. Is this
a competition?

19:04.317 --> 19:05.515
Hmm.

19:05.517 --> 19:08.418
I feel like we're
missing something.

19:08.420 --> 19:11.655
My backup backup curling iron.

19:11.657 --> 19:13.924
Didn't you hear what Scarletta
said about Pawville?

19:13.926 --> 19:16.359
I think we're going
to be roughing it, Donatina.

19:16.361 --> 19:20.263
You mean only one
spa treatment a day?

19:20.265 --> 19:21.732
I mean none.

19:21.734 --> 19:24.605
I don't understand.

19:30.542 --> 19:32.777
Is that all
you're bringing, Buncho?

19:32.779 --> 19:33.747
Yes.

19:42.888 --> 19:45.158
Howdy, y'all!

19:48.461 --> 19:51.261
Who's ready
to save us some Shoppets?

19:51.263 --> 19:53.731
- Yeah! - Yeah!
- Yeah!

19:53.733 --> 19:56.770
Ooh, it certainly seems like
you're ready for anything.

19:57.503 --> 19:59.339
Even gardening.

20:01.773 --> 20:03.607
Psst, psst.

20:06.846 --> 20:07.944
Loading jeep.

20:07.946 --> 20:09.012
Loading jeep.

20:09.014 --> 20:10.848
Exploding sheep.

20:19.492 --> 20:21.259
May I have your attention?

20:21.261 --> 20:22.462
Come on, girl.

20:26.366 --> 20:27.632
Aw!

20:27.634 --> 20:30.734
Rubie has something
to say. Go on.

20:30.736 --> 20:34.305
I just wanted
to say thank you.

20:34.307 --> 20:35.806
Aw!

20:35.808 --> 20:38.442
You're always so cute.

20:38.444 --> 20:40.978
Actually, I wasn't always.

20:40.980 --> 20:42.913
- What? - Unbelievable!
- No way!

20:42.915 --> 20:44.615
That's right.

20:44.617 --> 20:47.921
When I first met Rubie,
she was a scraggly little thing.

20:49.321 --> 20:51.722
You wouldn't think it
to look at me now,

20:51.724 --> 20:55.292
but I'll never forget the horrible
jungle where I came from.

20:56.529 --> 20:58.762
You're a saved Shoppet?

20:58.764 --> 21:02.299
That's right.
I was rescued from Pawville.

21:02.301 --> 21:04.501
Rubie's my inspiration.

21:04.503 --> 21:07.305
Hearing her talk about the
horrible life she was subjected to

21:07.307 --> 21:08.472
before I found her,

21:08.474 --> 21:12.510
I just knew
I had to do something.

21:12.512 --> 21:16.713
Pawville's a terrible place that
needs to be wiped from this world.

21:16.715 --> 21:18.683
- You're so kind.
- Scarletta, you are the best.

21:18.685 --> 21:20.751
There's no one
better than you.

21:20.753 --> 21:23.753
Rubie, do you have any friends
left behind in Pawville?

21:23.755 --> 21:25.356
Friends?

21:25.358 --> 21:27.327
- Uh, I...
- Rubie's all alone.

21:28.660 --> 21:31.595
I'll be your friend.

21:31.597 --> 21:33.931
And she's got me, of course.

21:33.933 --> 21:36.270
And now she has
all of us too.

21:39.571 --> 21:42.473
We better scoot off to Pawville
'fore we lose the mornin'.

21:42.475 --> 21:43.874
Ready, CLAW soldiers?

21:43.876 --> 21:45.376
Ready!

21:45.378 --> 21:46.944
Ooh, check it out.

21:46.946 --> 21:50.780
We all have Cortar series
2000 watches just like you.

21:50.782 --> 21:53.751
Well, isn't that
just the sweetest thing.

21:53.753 --> 21:55.386
Just like me.

21:55.388 --> 21:57.021
And what a good idea.

21:57.023 --> 21:59.292
Constant contact.

22:16.542 --> 22:18.642
This is how we get
to Pawville?

22:18.644 --> 22:20.380
More like "Pawful."

22:23.648 --> 22:26.416
We're not going
in there, right?

22:26.418 --> 22:28.754
It looks
very dark and scary.

22:33.826 --> 22:37.627
Cadets, there are hundreds of poor
defenseless Shoppets in there,

22:37.629 --> 22:39.530
just like Rubie.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.632
They are hungry!

22:41.634 --> 22:43.501
They are cold!

22:43.503 --> 22:45.668
It may be frightening,

22:45.670 --> 22:48.672
but we have pledged to help
those less fortunate.

22:48.674 --> 22:53.547
So, are we chickens
or are we heroes?

22:54.714 --> 22:56.646
Bawk!

22:56.648 --> 22:58.819
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

23:00.619 --> 23:02.886
Did you catch
that epic speech?

23:02.888 --> 23:03.956
Great.

23:11.097 --> 23:12.566
Where are you going?

23:13.599 --> 23:15.433
Oh, no.

23:15.435 --> 23:17.001
Don't you remember?

23:17.003 --> 23:19.770
Keep the engine running,
Clover.

23:19.772 --> 23:22.138
I have a hair appointment
for that press conference.

23:22.140 --> 23:27.845
Oh, it's just that, you know,
I'm so ridiculously famous

23:27.847 --> 23:30.447
that I can't go into Pawville

23:30.449 --> 23:33.586
because the paparazzi
will surely scare them away.

23:37.089 --> 23:40.624
Looks like something
scared the paparazzi away.

23:40.626 --> 23:43.560
Luckily,
a super-smart Shoppie

23:43.562 --> 23:46.797
made sure we all
had one of these,

23:46.799 --> 23:51.501
so it'll basically be like
I'm right there with you.

23:51.503 --> 23:54.238
In the meantime,
be fierce.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.109
Never give up!

23:58.043 --> 24:01.511
Oh, and remember,
when you find a Shoppet,

24:01.513 --> 24:04.714
do not ask them
about Pawville.

24:04.716 --> 24:07.550
Just escort them
straight out of the jungle

24:07.552 --> 24:09.589
to the rendezvous point.

24:12.757 --> 24:14.858
What was that
last part she said?

24:14.860 --> 24:18.761
- She, um... she said, "Never give up."
- And we won't.

24:18.763 --> 24:21.965
I meant the part about not
asking them about Pawville.

24:24.704 --> 24:26.002
Here goes.

24:26.004 --> 24:28.771
We've got Shoppets to save!

24:28.773 --> 24:31.876
Be, uh, fierce.

25:31.971 --> 25:33.205
Aah!

25:37.842 --> 25:40.344
Ooh. I'm so totally lost.

25:40.346 --> 25:43.047
Where are you guys?

25:43.049 --> 25:44.114
Here.

25:44.116 --> 25:45.214
Here.

25:45.216 --> 25:46.783
Here.

25:46.785 --> 25:49.619
Scarletta makes jungles
look so chill in the movies.

25:49.621 --> 25:51.187
I don't like it here.

25:51.189 --> 25:53.790
Hey, where are the Shopkins?

25:53.792 --> 25:57.161
Um, we're down here.

25:57.163 --> 25:58.828
Oh.

26:05.170 --> 26:07.671
There's something
out here with us.

26:07.673 --> 26:10.340
This is just like
<i>Ava Blade 4: Planet Wars,</i>

26:10.342 --> 26:14.179
where everybody was zapped into the
Zorb galaxy by alien invaders.

26:16.048 --> 26:19.617
Donatina, aliens haven't
been proven to exist yet.

26:19.619 --> 26:21.184
Key word... "yet."

26:21.186 --> 26:24.387
The truth is out there.

26:29.995 --> 26:33.262
I'm-I'm sure it's just a
Shoppet crying out for help.

26:33.264 --> 26:35.366
Waah!

26:38.137 --> 26:40.639
Wha-Wha-What
was that?

26:43.242 --> 26:44.674
Are you okay?

26:44.676 --> 26:46.111
Ow.

26:55.353 --> 26:57.988
<i>♪ Oh, dream banana ♪</i>

26:57.990 --> 26:59.857
I can't see.
What is it?

26:59.859 --> 27:02.662
"It" has a name.

27:04.696 --> 27:08.232
Bianca Banana, investigative
journalist, at your service.

27:08.234 --> 27:10.901
Wow. A real-life
investigator.

27:10.903 --> 27:12.806
Did you hear that, Wormy?

27:13.705 --> 27:16.139
Investigative journalist.

27:16.141 --> 27:19.009
What's a journalist doing in the
middle of a terrifying jungle?

27:19.011 --> 27:21.211
Well, I needed answers,
of course.

27:21.213 --> 27:22.812
Answers of what?

27:22.814 --> 27:25.449
There's something fishy
about someone I know.

27:25.451 --> 27:28.918
I'm here to prove it. I got
a tip off from Mistabella.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.753
Mistabella?

27:30.755 --> 27:34.191
Well, I was writing a story
on her new flick.

27:34.193 --> 27:36.026
Let me get this straight.

27:36.028 --> 27:39.128
You're saying Rubie Blaze
is not who she says she is.

27:39.130 --> 27:43.867
I just have my suspicions about them,
you know? Pawville is actually...

27:43.869 --> 27:47.003
Are you trying to tell me that Rubie
Blaze is not actually an actor?

27:47.005 --> 27:49.940
No, but my manager
is from Pawville, and...

27:49.942 --> 27:52.443
You're telling me that Rubie
Blaze is not a raccoon.

27:52.445 --> 27:54.179
- Bianca...
- Did you just wink at me?

27:55.947 --> 27:58.848
All right, cub.
That's enough questions.

27:58.850 --> 28:01.719
You're stressing Mistabella out, and
she's got a big concert tonight.

28:01.721 --> 28:03.319
Go on. Get.

28:03.321 --> 28:07.393
Bianca, I'm saying
I'm worried about Rubie.

28:10.361 --> 28:13.733
Do you have the ability
to control time?

28:15.434 --> 28:19.272
So my thinking is she's not really
a raccoon. Probably an alien.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.274
See? Told you.

28:23.007 --> 28:25.444
Trust no one.

28:28.313 --> 28:30.446
Well, I intend
to find out.

28:30.448 --> 28:32.515
I hate seeing
Mistabella upset.

28:32.517 --> 28:34.384
I feel ya, sista.

28:34.386 --> 28:36.019
Okay, your turn.

28:36.021 --> 28:38.521
What are a bunch of Shopville
slickers doing out here?

28:38.523 --> 28:40.924
She knows my name.

28:40.926 --> 28:42.826
Aah!

28:44.996 --> 28:48.866
She said "bunch of."
He heard "Buncho."

28:48.868 --> 28:49.532
Close enough.

28:52.271 --> 28:56.272
Oh. I forgot about
that scary growl from before.

28:56.274 --> 28:58.177
What was that?

28:59.278 --> 29:01.081
Over there!

29:02.113 --> 29:03.847
No, there.

29:09.321 --> 29:11.424
We're surrounded.

29:14.059 --> 29:16.326
Aah!

29:19.532 --> 29:21.835
Aah!

29:41.052 --> 29:44.154
<i>Hello?</i>

29:44.156 --> 29:47.825
How's it going for y'all in Pawville?
Found any poor Shoppets yet?

29:47.827 --> 29:49.259
<i>I don't know if you've noticed,</i>

29:49.261 --> 29:52.328
<i>but we're kind of busy running
through the jungle right now.</i>

29:52.330 --> 29:54.897
<i>Yeah. You need to save us.</i>

29:54.899 --> 29:58.268
Oh, sounds like someone's
been drinkin' the drama juice.

29:58.270 --> 30:00.303
Best to save that
for the talent.

30:00.305 --> 30:01.938
<i>Please, Scarletta.</i>

30:01.940 --> 30:05.075
<i>I really think we're
being chased by a monster.</i>

30:05.077 --> 30:08.044
<i>Looks like I might have
to start planning our funerals.</i>

30:09.548 --> 30:12.551
Rubie, you're from Pawville.
Tell our friends what to do.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.052
<i>Get out of there.</i>

30:18.858 --> 30:19.792
Rude.

30:20.993 --> 30:23.059
She left us.

30:23.061 --> 30:24.563
She left us!

30:38.510 --> 30:40.143
It's gone.

30:40.145 --> 30:43.446
Great. All that exercise
for nothing.

30:43.448 --> 30:45.884
Hey, gang. I think...

30:50.488 --> 30:52.188
Oh, my.

30:52.190 --> 30:53.458
Wait.

30:55.660 --> 30:58.127
Everybody remain calm.

30:58.129 --> 31:00.065
I know what to do.

31:12.610 --> 31:14.278
Okay.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.680
It doesn't work
like the movie. Run!

31:22.154 --> 31:23.122
Aah!

31:36.034 --> 31:36.934
Huh?

31:36.936 --> 31:39.202
Ha ha!

31:39.204 --> 31:40.671
We pranked you good.

31:40.673 --> 31:42.138
I'm Pupkin Cake.

31:42.140 --> 31:43.507
Sorry for scaring ya,

31:43.509 --> 31:45.675
but this is
our Shoppet welcome.

31:45.677 --> 31:49.178
We pride ourselves
on pranks, fun, and kindness.

31:49.180 --> 31:51.049
What?

31:52.350 --> 31:55.953
You'll never take
our freedom!

31:55.955 --> 31:57.988
Take that and that!

31:57.990 --> 32:00.991
Hey, quit it.
That tickles.

32:00.993 --> 32:03.659
Come on, pals.
The jig is up.

32:03.661 --> 32:06.296
Aw!

32:06.298 --> 32:08.498
Aha. It was you.

32:08.500 --> 32:09.502
Huh?

32:10.735 --> 32:13.436
- How do you like it?
- Aah!

32:13.438 --> 32:17.109
Duncan, is that any way
to treat a new pal?

32:18.310 --> 32:20.309
But-But-But back
in the jungle,

32:20.311 --> 32:21.444
the tree shook.

32:21.446 --> 32:22.745
The ground trembled.

32:22.747 --> 32:25.482
The-The-The monster came
from the other direction.

32:26.685 --> 32:29.019
There's something
still out there.

32:29.021 --> 32:32.356
Yeah, we can get a bit
carried away with pranks.

32:32.358 --> 32:35.125
- That was us.
- Huh?

32:35.127 --> 32:37.626
A good prank is not just
about jumping out at someone

32:37.628 --> 32:39.296
in a scary costume.

32:39.298 --> 32:40.998
You gotta set
the atmosphere.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.531
Make it an experience.

32:42.533 --> 32:45.001
Duncan masterminded
this monster.

32:45.003 --> 32:47.303
My finest work.

32:47.305 --> 32:49.039
I'm Minty Paws.

32:49.041 --> 32:51.008
You may recognize
my growl.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.274
Meow!

32:52.276 --> 32:54.644
Aw!

32:54.646 --> 32:57.347
That was precious.

32:57.349 --> 32:59.750
A tiger that can't roar.

32:59.752 --> 33:04.687
Grrrrr! You were scared of that
growl, like, ten minutes ago.

33:04.689 --> 33:07.156
Aw!

33:07.158 --> 33:09.393
Bunny Bow made the
ground shake under you.

33:09.395 --> 33:10.696
Powerful legs.

33:12.563 --> 33:15.398
But what about
the tree shaking?

33:18.203 --> 33:20.037
Oh. I had an itchy back.

33:20.039 --> 33:21.738
Ew. Gross.

33:21.740 --> 33:23.540
So as mayor of Pawville,

33:23.542 --> 33:27.043
I'd like to apologize for
scaring you with our, eh,

33:27.045 --> 33:28.513
Shoppet welcome.

33:29.648 --> 33:31.615
I'm the mayor of Shopville.

33:31.617 --> 33:33.349
Good for you.

33:33.351 --> 33:36.353
Whoa, whoa. Hang on.
You're from Pawville?

33:36.355 --> 33:38.320
But your clothes
aren't tattered.

33:38.322 --> 33:40.656
And they have mayors
in Pawville?

33:40.658 --> 33:42.227
Do you need saving?

33:45.664 --> 33:48.065
Is this mint lady
for real?

33:48.067 --> 33:49.566
What would we need
saving from?

33:49.568 --> 33:51.337
Jungle monsters.

33:52.538 --> 33:54.203
That was us, Duncan.

33:54.205 --> 33:57.273
Oh, yeah.

33:57.275 --> 34:00.446
Come on. Let's show 'em
how we do it in Pawville.

36:47.011 --> 36:49.612
Yes!

36:49.614 --> 36:53.483
Oh, yeah! I am so feeling
this wild style.

36:53.485 --> 36:54.420
Raaar!

36:55.721 --> 36:56.987
Meow!

36:56.989 --> 37:00.857
Aw! That was
incredibly cute.

37:00.859 --> 37:02.324
Stop!

37:02.326 --> 37:05.628
It was
a terrifying roar.

37:05.630 --> 37:07.797
You are so cute.

37:07.799 --> 37:08.965
I'm not cute.

37:08.967 --> 37:10.866
Aw!

37:10.868 --> 37:12.804
Raaar!

37:14.373 --> 37:17.677
Did you see me fighting
that monster earlier?

37:18.944 --> 37:22.478
Yeah, I was pretty brave.

37:24.782 --> 37:27.319
Are you impressed?

37:34.493 --> 37:37.527
Well, I am officially
in love with Pawville.

37:37.529 --> 37:39.795
Life just got pawesome.

37:39.797 --> 37:42.766
Yeah!
P-A-W...

37:42.768 --> 37:45.668
Uh... You know how
to spell the rest.

37:45.670 --> 37:49.505
I'm sure glad we came, even though
it looks like we didn't need to.

37:49.507 --> 37:53.643
You mean we did all that running
and jungling for nothing?

37:53.645 --> 37:56.980
Lippy, exercise is good for you.
Accept it.

37:56.982 --> 38:01.550
You're just lucky there ended
up being a beauty parlor here.

38:01.552 --> 38:04.688
I did really want to do
some saving though.

38:04.690 --> 38:06.989
Why are you so obsessed
with saving?

38:06.991 --> 38:09.458
- That's what we came here to do.
- Right.

38:09.460 --> 38:12.594
Scarletta Gateau told us
Pawville was a terrible place

38:12.596 --> 38:14.797
and you all needed
to be saved from it.

38:14.799 --> 38:16.065
Scarletta Ga-who?

38:16.067 --> 38:18.735
Scarletta Gateau,
Rubie's sidekick.

38:18.737 --> 38:20.402
Her?

38:20.404 --> 38:24.507
She stole my monster design
for her hack movie.

38:24.509 --> 38:26.775
You know Rubie Blaze?

38:26.777 --> 38:29.545
Don't you ever mention
that name around here again.

38:29.547 --> 38:31.614
I'm so sorry.

38:31.616 --> 38:33.583
Just leave us alone!

38:38.757 --> 38:40.924
Drama!

38:40.926 --> 38:42.828
What was that about?

38:44.029 --> 38:45.898
We need
to show you something.

38:48.532 --> 38:50.800
Yeah, here.
Have a look at this.

38:50.802 --> 38:53.902
What am I looking at?

38:57.775 --> 38:59.141
Really, Duncan?

38:59.143 --> 39:02.112
You choose this moment
to play a prank?

39:03.614 --> 39:04.748
What's happened?

39:04.750 --> 39:06.782
Ignore him.
He's always like this.

39:06.784 --> 39:07.786
Come on. Follow us.

39:09.154 --> 39:10.052
Ha ha.

39:10.054 --> 39:11.487
Panda Eyes.

39:16.627 --> 39:18.728
It's not even a good joke.

39:18.730 --> 39:20.563
Over here.

39:20.565 --> 39:22.532
Rubie was
our best friend.

39:22.534 --> 39:25.969
And she was Pupkin
Cake's best best friend.

39:25.971 --> 39:29.572
<i>They were the best double
act Pawville had ever seen.</i>

39:29.574 --> 39:33.412
<i>But Pawville wasn't
big enough for Rubie.</i>

39:51.663 --> 39:54.463
<i>I wanna be famous, Pupkin Cake.</i>

39:54.465 --> 39:57.634
We're already famous,
in Pawville.

39:57.636 --> 39:59.735
Pawville's not enough.

39:59.737 --> 40:01.737
I want film premieres,

40:01.739 --> 40:05.007
fancy parties
and glamorous trips.

40:05.009 --> 40:06.708
Come with me.

40:06.710 --> 40:08.710
I'm not leaving
my friends.

40:08.712 --> 40:10.715
I'm not leaving Pawville.

40:15.953 --> 40:18.487
Remember what I told you.

40:18.489 --> 40:20.926
A good prank
is an experience.

40:22.560 --> 40:26.128
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

40:26.130 --> 40:28.030
I wish you
weren't leaving.

40:28.032 --> 40:30.967
I'll be back to visit
before you know it.

40:34.739 --> 40:36.942
Ooh, I think I see the bus.

40:40.545 --> 40:41.781
Ooh!

40:42.913 --> 40:44.850
What time
does she get in?

40:49.753 --> 40:52.755
<i>Pupkin Cake
took Rubie leaving the hardest.</i>

40:56.094 --> 40:58.496
<i>We haven't seen Rubie since.</i>

41:03.000 --> 41:05.768
She doesn't let us
leave Pawville now.

41:05.770 --> 41:07.907
She says
it's to protect us.

41:20.652 --> 41:22.851
Hey, I can travel
back in time

41:22.853 --> 41:25.189
to learn about things
that happened in the past.

41:31.929 --> 41:34.764
What ya doing?

41:34.766 --> 41:36.833
That was a juicy scoop.

41:36.835 --> 41:41.206
I'm starting to think that maybe
Rubie Blaze <i>is</i> a raccoon.

41:42.873 --> 41:45.275
Hey. Look at what
I can do.

41:52.049 --> 41:54.819
Yeah, I'm pretty strong.

41:58.822 --> 42:00.690
Something
doesn't add up.

42:00.692 --> 42:04.059
Why would Scarletta tell us
that Rubie was saved?

42:04.061 --> 42:08.630
And that Pawville was so awful that
you all needed to be saved too?

42:08.632 --> 42:11.634
To be honest, we're not big
fans of hers around here.

42:11.636 --> 42:15.003
We can barely
say her name around here.

42:15.005 --> 42:17.306
Scar...
Nope. Can't say it.

42:17.308 --> 42:19.608
- Yuck!
- Aw!

42:19.610 --> 42:22.945
Stop it!

42:22.947 --> 42:26.916
But she's an awesome movie star
who's the kindest person, to boot.

42:26.918 --> 42:29.953
We could teach her a thing
or two about kindness.

42:29.955 --> 42:31.654
She's a prank thief.

42:33.991 --> 42:37.259
Whoa. It's like she knew
we were talking about her.

42:37.261 --> 42:40.697
Maybe <i>she</i> is an alien.

42:40.699 --> 42:42.799
Think before you talk.

42:42.801 --> 42:44.701
What do we do?
What do we do?

42:44.703 --> 42:46.134
Answer it!

42:47.639 --> 42:50.105
Hi, Scarletta.

42:50.107 --> 42:53.108
<i>Hello, my sweet
little Shoppie heroes.</i>

42:53.110 --> 42:56.878
<i>Just wanted to make sure you're
savin' all those poor Shoppets.</i>

42:56.880 --> 42:58.146
Hey, good news.

42:58.148 --> 43:00.016
The Shoppets
don't need to be saved.

43:00.018 --> 43:02.184
<i>Wait. You're not...</i>

43:02.186 --> 43:04.286
<i>Is that Kitty Town Hall
behind you?</i>

43:04.288 --> 43:06.255
<i>Oh, have you met Pupki...</i>

43:09.860 --> 43:11.960
Scarletta's a liar.

43:11.962 --> 43:17.000
But I also can't say I've been
particularly honest either.

43:17.002 --> 43:18.634
Where have you been?

43:18.636 --> 43:20.302
She's been
angry dancing.

43:20.304 --> 43:22.840
I need to show you something.

43:30.147 --> 43:31.748
Oh!

43:31.750 --> 43:33.181
- Huh?
- No!

43:33.183 --> 43:35.019
No!

43:40.290 --> 43:43.659
I went to Shoppiewood once
to find Rubie.

43:44.828 --> 43:47.163
What? When?

43:47.165 --> 43:50.299
Remember when I said I was
visiting my cousin in Idogho?

43:51.670 --> 43:54.170
You're a sneaky doggo.

43:54.172 --> 43:56.172
Well, I didn't find Rubie.

43:56.174 --> 43:58.373
Instead, I found Scarletta.

43:58.375 --> 44:00.409
She told me Rubie hated Pawville

44:00.411 --> 44:02.712
and never wanted
to see us again.

44:02.714 --> 44:05.313
I became obsessed with figuring
out why Rubie changed,

44:05.315 --> 44:07.250
and what I uncovered was...

44:09.353 --> 44:10.953
<i>Hello, heroes.</i>

44:10.955 --> 44:12.889
Just wanted to make sure
y'all are doing

44:12.891 --> 44:15.692
what I sent you
into Pawville to do

44:15.694 --> 44:20.797
and not something else, like talking
to Shoppets about backstory.

44:20.799 --> 44:24.733
Um, can you remind us again why
you wanted us to come here?

44:24.735 --> 44:25.934
Ahh!

44:25.936 --> 44:28.003
Your mission is

44:28.005 --> 44:32.775
to save all the poor, innocent,
needy little Shoppets in Pawville.

44:32.777 --> 44:38.081
<i>And then you're going to take care of
them at the CLAW Shoppet Rescue, right?</i>

44:38.083 --> 44:39.282
Of course.

44:39.284 --> 44:41.451
Why the 20 questions?

44:41.453 --> 44:44.119
<i>But what if they
don't need to be saved?</i>

44:44.121 --> 44:47.255
Oh! They need to be saved.

44:47.257 --> 44:50.159
Those little twerps
need to be schooled

44:50.161 --> 44:53.730
on how to vote for the Ultimate
Shoppies Choice Golden Award.

44:53.732 --> 44:56.232
Wait. What is
she talking about?

44:56.234 --> 45:00.136
We always vote for Mistabella in the
Ultimate Shoppies Choice Golden Awards.

45:00.138 --> 45:02.938
The Ava Blade movies
are lame.

45:02.940 --> 45:04.507
<i>I heard that,
you little fur balls!</i>

45:06.143 --> 45:08.444
You lied to us.

45:08.446 --> 45:11.079
This isn't about
saving the Shoppets.

45:11.081 --> 45:13.983
This is about your ego.

45:13.985 --> 45:16.251
You were our hero.

45:16.253 --> 45:18.820
Did you ever
believe in us?

45:18.822 --> 45:21.159
Was there ever
even a rescue?

45:24.462 --> 45:27.395
<i>Call it movie magic.</i>

45:27.397 --> 45:29.264
<i>I only recruited you</i>

45:29.266 --> 45:32.467
<i>because they love
your little gang online,</i>

45:32.469 --> 45:37.005
<i>and being aligned with you
will get me more votes.</i>

45:37.007 --> 45:39.842
You're not going
to get away with this.

45:39.844 --> 45:42.811
Yeah. We don't
like you anymore.

45:42.813 --> 45:44.313
<i>I'm likable!</i>

45:44.315 --> 45:47.449
<i>Not like that no-talent
hack Mistabella.</i>

45:47.451 --> 45:51.253
<i>I</i> will <i>be the most
liked star in the world</i>

45:51.255 --> 45:55.491
<i>whether you and your little feral
pets are around to see it or not!</i>

45:55.493 --> 45:58.063
Yeah. Okay, bring it on!

45:59.429 --> 46:02.498
<i>Pack my bags
for Pawville hideout.</i>

46:02.500 --> 46:05.300
<i>It's time to end this
once and for all.</i>

46:05.302 --> 46:07.335
<i>Uh, Scarletta.</i>

46:07.337 --> 46:09.070
<i>Did you hang up?</i>

46:09.072 --> 46:10.405
<i>Oh, crumbs.</i>

46:10.407 --> 46:12.474
<i>Gah! How does
this thing work again?</i>

46:12.476 --> 46:13.842
<i>I'm all frazzled.</i>

46:13.844 --> 46:15.578
<i>It's just the...</i>

46:15.580 --> 46:17.512
<i>Don't you miss when you
could slam shut a flip-phone?</i>

46:17.514 --> 46:19.447
<i>Now, that was
a dramatic hang-up.</i>

46:21.085 --> 46:24.956
- Well, it's clear what she's going to do.
- Huh? Wha...

46:26.190 --> 46:27.889
She's made deals
with the press

46:27.891 --> 46:31.860
to write fake news
about a war in Pawville.

46:31.862 --> 46:34.230
She's going to destroy Pawville

46:34.232 --> 46:38.233
so it looks like the horrible
place that the press say it is.

46:38.235 --> 46:41.270
And then she'll put it
all over social media

46:41.272 --> 46:44.040
that she saved
the Shoppets just in time

46:44.042 --> 46:48.413
so everyone votes for her in the
Ultimate Shoppies Choice Golden Award.

46:51.014 --> 46:52.882
Kooky?

46:52.884 --> 46:55.016
How did you figure
all that out?

46:55.018 --> 46:56.254
I've had that up
for months.

46:58.857 --> 47:00.889
I don't know.

47:00.891 --> 47:04.192
Well, if it's a war
Scarletta wants,

47:04.194 --> 47:07.565
then it's a war
she's gonna get.

47:08.866 --> 47:11.069
Yay. Planning party!

47:16.540 --> 47:18.409
Yeah. It's huge.

47:19.509 --> 47:21.210
Are you getting all this?

47:21.212 --> 47:22.511
Hey!

47:22.513 --> 47:24.148
You have to get out here.

47:25.315 --> 47:27.418
- I read books.
- Cool.

47:30.087 --> 47:31.152
Finished.

47:31.154 --> 47:32.456
Did you enjoy it?

47:34.157 --> 47:36.295
Aah!

47:40.230 --> 47:42.965
Okay, let's get down
to business.

47:42.967 --> 47:45.500
You have
a, uh, plan?

47:45.502 --> 47:47.270
I was born with a plan.

47:47.272 --> 47:49.971
We know Scarletta
has a secret hideout.

47:49.973 --> 47:53.375
Tiger Tribe, that's Peppamint,
Apple Blossom, and Minty Paws.

47:53.377 --> 47:55.446
This place looks
pretty suspicious.

47:56.915 --> 47:59.447
What if
there's a monster?

47:59.449 --> 48:02.018
You'll have the toughest
Shoppet in Pawville with you.

48:02.020 --> 48:03.119
Bunny Bow?

48:03.121 --> 48:05.387
No! Me!

48:05.389 --> 48:07.623
Aw!

48:07.625 --> 48:11.494
Jessicake, you, Cheeky, and
Kooky are with Pupkin Cake.

48:11.496 --> 48:13.663
- Uh...
- Yes, Cheeky?

48:13.665 --> 48:18.134
May I suggest our name
be Tribe Choco-Pup?

48:18.136 --> 48:19.367
I'll allow it.

48:19.369 --> 48:20.638
Yes!

48:21.940 --> 48:25.041
What's a tribe?

48:25.043 --> 48:28.576
From the top of this mountain,
we'll be able to see everything.

48:28.578 --> 48:32.280
<i>You need to get up there and check out what
kind of artillery Scarletta's bringing.</i>

48:32.282 --> 48:35.119
Donatina and Duncan,
who do you want on Tribe Monkey?

48:36.054 --> 48:37.389
I want the bananas.

48:39.389 --> 48:42.157
Good thing we have Scarletta's
biggest fan amongst us.

48:42.159 --> 48:44.393
Ex-biggest fan.

48:44.395 --> 48:47.329
<i>We know that Scarletta and Rubie
Blaze will be coming into Pawville.</i>

48:47.331 --> 48:48.667
<i>We need trackers.</i>

48:51.536 --> 48:53.335
Tribe Rainbow Bunny.

48:53.337 --> 48:55.637
We'll keep calling Scarletta
on the Cortar 2000

48:55.639 --> 48:57.340
to find out
what she's doing.

48:57.342 --> 49:00.409
Once we know where she is,
we'll catch her by surprise.

49:00.411 --> 49:03.212
Ready, tribes?
Let's break!

49:03.214 --> 49:05.284
Hooray!

49:10.621 --> 49:12.221
Uh, Lippy?

49:12.223 --> 49:13.556
Mm-hmm.

49:13.558 --> 49:17.259
Do you want to help save
Pawville in any way or...

49:17.261 --> 49:18.460
Mm-hmm.

49:18.462 --> 49:20.431
Tribe Bunny. Yay.

49:27.605 --> 49:30.473
Hey, would anybody
like some peanuts?

49:33.643 --> 49:35.511
What? It's just
some peanuts.

49:35.513 --> 49:37.112
Oh, no.

49:37.114 --> 49:39.514
I've learnt my lesson
from the binoculars.

49:39.516 --> 49:43.251
It's totally going to do that thing where
snakes pop out or something, isn't it?

49:43.253 --> 49:44.786
It's peanuts.

49:44.788 --> 49:46.521
I packed a snack.

49:46.523 --> 49:47.592
Open it.

49:54.699 --> 49:56.435
Whew.

49:58.136 --> 50:00.036
Ha ha!

50:04.042 --> 50:06.474
Wasabi!

50:07.744 --> 50:11.079
Super hot peanuts?
Okay, that's a good one.

50:11.081 --> 50:13.719
Hmm. What's that?

50:16.186 --> 50:19.487
That's Catnel, Scarletta's
favorite sunglasses brand.

50:19.489 --> 50:21.623
If she left them
out here,

50:21.625 --> 50:23.692
she must be going somewhere
with no sun.

50:25.596 --> 50:26.795
Oh! Oh!

50:26.797 --> 50:28.596
I can't go on.

50:28.598 --> 50:30.232
Come on!

50:30.234 --> 50:32.333
You can do it, Peppamint!

50:32.335 --> 50:34.235
It's only
a little distance.

50:34.237 --> 50:37.139
Sorry. I live here now.

50:37.141 --> 50:40.509
Peppamint, think about
why we're doing this.

50:40.511 --> 50:44.248
I-I-I-I love
my new log home.

50:49.686 --> 50:52.487
Remember, you're doing this
for your tribe,

50:52.489 --> 50:53.721
for your friends.

50:53.723 --> 50:56.491
Oh, you're right.

50:56.493 --> 50:59.795
I-I-I promised to help them.

50:59.797 --> 51:02.300
Oh!

51:04.368 --> 51:06.371
Oh!

51:10.540 --> 51:13.778
Another case solved
by Detective Wormy.

51:20.817 --> 51:22.617
Lippy Lips, you're up.

51:24.688 --> 51:27.623
<i>Why are you calling me?</i>

51:27.625 --> 51:31.893
"How to tell if your friend
is not who she says she is."

51:31.895 --> 51:33.228
<i>Is this a quiz?</i>

51:34.364 --> 51:36.764
Uh, hold on a second.

51:36.766 --> 51:39.869
<i>...really think
I have time for this?</i>

51:39.871 --> 51:41.670
Question number one.

51:41.672 --> 51:44.672
You tell her a secret,
does she...

51:44.674 --> 51:48.744
"A," keep it
to herself forever.

51:48.746 --> 51:52.681
"B," immediately text it
to everyone.

51:52.683 --> 51:54.516
<i>Or "C," you stu...</i>

51:54.518 --> 51:55.650
<i>...won't be...</i>

51:55.652 --> 51:57.686
<i>alive any...</i>

52:01.259 --> 52:02.858
Good work, lipstick.

52:02.860 --> 52:04.592
Duh.

52:04.594 --> 52:06.362
You just got Scarletta
to tell us

52:06.364 --> 52:09.331
that she's somewhere with
no reception, like here.

52:13.436 --> 52:15.237
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, bull...

52:15.239 --> 52:17.639
She's got a whole
demolition crew ready.

52:17.641 --> 52:19.241
Well, I'll be.

52:19.243 --> 52:21.710
That sure looks
like a hideout.

52:21.712 --> 52:23.779
Way too obvious.

52:23.781 --> 52:27.849
So exactly Scarletta's style.

52:27.851 --> 52:31.887
We gotta get down there. Nobody
destroys Pawville and gets away it.

52:31.889 --> 52:35.360
Say hello to Jessi-blade.

52:36.661 --> 52:40.565
Ay!

52:43.201 --> 52:45.302
Scarletta and Rubie
are at the cave!

52:48.772 --> 52:49.938
Okay, tribes.

52:49.940 --> 52:52.541
We came to Pawville
to be heroes.

52:52.543 --> 52:54.476
So let's be those heroes.

52:54.478 --> 52:55.811
Be fierce!

52:55.813 --> 52:58.250
- Never give up!
- Never give up.

53:04.288 --> 53:05.520
Oh.

53:05.522 --> 53:07.355
Kind of hard
to be heroes

53:07.357 --> 53:09.657
when you can't see anything.

53:09.659 --> 53:12.962
It's so dark in here.

53:12.964 --> 53:14.929
Obviously.

53:16.634 --> 53:17.900
Ohh!

53:17.902 --> 53:19.367
That's funny.

53:19.369 --> 53:21.704
Kooky's only allergic to...

53:21.706 --> 53:23.838
Raccoons!

53:25.676 --> 53:28.547
The ol' fake floor prank.

53:34.784 --> 53:36.018
Some heroes.

53:37.487 --> 53:40.255
I'm more organized,

53:40.257 --> 53:41.489
braver...

53:42.525 --> 53:44.529
Definitely smarter.

53:45.529 --> 53:46.929
I'm not nicer,

53:46.931 --> 53:49.431
but I don't wanna be nice.

53:55.005 --> 53:58.706
Rubie, how can you
let her do this to Pawville,

53:58.708 --> 53:59.907
to us?

53:59.909 --> 54:02.378
We were
your friends.

54:02.380 --> 54:04.512
This was your home.

54:04.514 --> 54:06.382
I have my reasons.

54:06.384 --> 54:08.583
Bye-bye, Shop-pests.

54:08.585 --> 54:10.753
Wait. You can't
do this to us.

54:10.755 --> 54:13.355
Uh, yes, I can.

54:13.357 --> 54:16.458
You signed your lives away.

54:16.460 --> 54:20.628
Luckily, you already voted for the
Ultimate Shoppies Choice Golden Award

54:20.630 --> 54:24.300
before you
so tragically disappeared.

54:25.368 --> 54:27.503
What?
We didn't vote.

54:27.505 --> 54:29.804
Yeah, you have.

54:29.806 --> 54:33.041
Always read the fine print, ladies.

54:33.043 --> 54:35.777
You can't leave us here.
What are we gonna do?

54:35.779 --> 54:38.579
Not my problem.

54:38.581 --> 54:42.717
But I'll make sure
to cry...

54:42.719 --> 54:46.521
When I tell your tragic
story to the press.

54:55.565 --> 54:57.498
I failed all of you.

54:57.500 --> 54:59.735
That doesn't seem fair.

54:59.737 --> 55:02.904
But if I hadn't wanted to
be a leader like Ava Blade,

55:02.906 --> 55:05.507
I never would have
pushed you all to do this.

55:05.509 --> 55:08.376
But you're so good
at motivating us.

55:08.378 --> 55:11.012
Or me wanting to become
BFF's with Scarletta.

55:11.014 --> 55:13.782
You're so friendly
and welcoming.

55:13.784 --> 55:16.552
Or me just being
obsessed with her.

55:16.554 --> 55:18.619
But you know
so much.

55:18.621 --> 55:20.655
No, it's my fault.

55:20.657 --> 55:22.458
I'm always so scared.

55:22.460 --> 55:24.659
I just wanted
to be brave like her.

55:24.661 --> 55:27.929
But you're full
of kindness, like us.

55:27.931 --> 55:29.931
Yeah. Nobody's perfect.

55:29.933 --> 55:32.770
But in a way,
that's what makes us perfect.

55:33.938 --> 55:36.871
Well, kindness
isn't going to help us

55:36.873 --> 55:38.373
get out of this hole.

55:38.375 --> 55:40.842
We're all doomed!

55:42.078 --> 55:45.681
No, it's my fault.

55:45.683 --> 55:47.983
I'm always so scared.

55:47.985 --> 55:51.323
I just wanted
to be brave like her.

Glad we got the mushy stuff
out of the way

59:12.889 --> 59:15.859
because this looks
like the end.

59:19.663 --> 59:22.230
You! What are you
doing here?

59:23.933 --> 59:25.800
Haven't you done
enough already?

59:25.802 --> 59:28.772
I haven't done
nearly enough.

59:33.377 --> 59:34.976
You're free to go.

59:34.978 --> 59:37.212
Go stop Scarletta.

59:37.214 --> 59:39.014
You're finished.

59:39.016 --> 59:42.217
We're hopping mad.

59:42.219 --> 59:44.619
That really sounds like
something I should say.

59:44.621 --> 59:46.757
Don't trust her!

59:47.857 --> 59:50.224
I get why you're mad.

59:50.226 --> 59:52.996
But you don't know
what it was like out there.

59:57.801 --> 01:00:01.203
<i>Everything was so big
and overwhelming.</i>

01:00:01.205 --> 01:00:05.773
<i>I was rejected at every turn.</i>

01:00:05.775 --> 01:00:08.745
<i>No one wanted
a singing, dancing Shoppet.</i>

01:00:11.181 --> 01:00:15.219
<i>That city would have swallowed
me up whole pretty soon.</i>

01:00:19.223 --> 01:00:21.926
<i>But then Scarletta found me.</i>

01:00:23.092 --> 01:00:25.362
<i>She promised me everything...</i>

01:00:26.663 --> 01:00:28.198
<i>and delivered.</i>

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.770
<i>We lived
the most glamorous life.</i>

01:00:35.072 --> 01:00:37.271
<i>I was in the movies. Famous.</i>

01:00:37.273 --> 01:00:40.041
<i>Everything I ever wanted.</i>

01:00:40.043 --> 01:00:42.110
<i>But she forbade me</i>

01:00:42.112 --> 01:00:45.617
<i>from ever talking about
or visiting Pawville again.</i>

01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:50.418
I can see now
that she was just using me.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:53.288
She was nothing
before I came along.

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:57.291
She needed a cute sidekick
to make her likable.

01:00:57.293 --> 01:01:00.395
I missed home every day.

01:01:00.397 --> 01:01:02.697
I'm so sorry.

01:01:02.699 --> 01:01:05.902
You can be angry.
I understand.

01:01:07.971 --> 01:01:10.204
Welcome home.

01:01:10.206 --> 01:01:11.338
Aw!

01:01:13.243 --> 01:01:15.177
Hate to break up
our reunion,

01:01:15.179 --> 01:01:17.878
but we have
a Pawville to save.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.118
- Yeah! - Yay!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:01:21.085 --> 01:01:22.353
Yeah!

01:01:29.226 --> 01:01:32.761
This is it. This is
<i>our</i> Ava Blade moment.

01:01:32.763 --> 01:01:36.764
Just remember that no matter what
happens today, we're all heroes.

01:01:36.766 --> 01:01:39.034
Pawville has saved
all of us.

01:01:39.036 --> 01:01:42.003
And now it's time
for us to save Pawville.

01:01:42.005 --> 01:01:44.005
Love
your tribe!

01:01:44.007 --> 01:01:46.177
- Party on!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:01:47.243 --> 01:01:48.446
Yeah!

01:01:51.882 --> 01:01:53.315
Bring it on!

01:01:53.317 --> 01:01:55.786
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

01:02:02.493 --> 01:02:06.360
Ha. The only thing swinging around
here will be this wrecking ball.

01:02:06.362 --> 01:02:10.033
Monkey see,
monkey kick butt.

01:02:11.134 --> 01:02:11.902
Huh?

01:02:13.936 --> 01:02:15.469
Blast off!

01:02:15.471 --> 01:02:17.874
Ah-yah!

01:02:19.375 --> 01:02:21.311
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

01:02:25.148 --> 01:02:27.081
Stop right there.

01:02:27.083 --> 01:02:29.116
'Cause we're not
monkeying around.

01:02:35.958 --> 01:02:36.927
Huh?

01:02:38.962 --> 01:02:40.331
Get paved!

01:02:41.264 --> 01:02:43.000
Aah!

01:02:57.413 --> 01:03:00.047
Time to make
a juice cart smoothie.

01:03:03.987 --> 01:03:04.956
Wha...

01:03:07.456 --> 01:03:09.993
Move over.

01:03:12.529 --> 01:03:13.895
Meow!

01:03:13.897 --> 01:03:17.998
You're so cute.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.536
Ha ha! I'm not afraid
of an adorable little kitten.

01:03:22.538 --> 01:03:23.838
- No?
- Yeah.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:26.942
I am not a kitten.

01:03:26.944 --> 01:03:30.945
I am not cute!

01:03:33.016 --> 01:03:34.181
Let me go!

01:03:34.183 --> 01:03:35.616
Let me go. Let me go. Let me go.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.496
You're no match
for Ava Blade.

01:04:09.252 --> 01:04:12.286
Ha! And you call
yourselves heroes?

01:04:12.288 --> 01:04:15.892
In case you were wondering,
I do all my own stunts.

01:04:19.897 --> 01:04:21.065
What do <i>you</i> want?

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.366
Knock knock.

01:04:25.368 --> 01:04:27.101
Rubie!

01:04:27.103 --> 01:04:28.172
Finally.

01:04:29.373 --> 01:04:31.005
Who's there?

01:04:31.007 --> 01:04:32.176
Raccoon Eyes.

01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:35.242
What are you
talking about?

01:04:35.244 --> 01:04:38.480
Rubie, take care of my
little problems, won't you?

01:04:38.482 --> 01:04:40.484
Raccoon Eyes who?

01:04:41.217 --> 01:04:42.349
Rubie!

01:04:42.351 --> 01:04:44.518
Don't you "Raccoon Eyes" me?

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:48.322
Quit joking around, Bandit,

01:04:48.324 --> 01:04:51.558
or it's the last you'll ever
see of your movie-star life.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.962
You should recognize me

01:04:53.964 --> 01:04:57.398
as the cutest star
in all of Shoppiewood.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.301
Huh?

01:05:04.007 --> 01:05:05.309
Huh-yah!

01:05:37.641 --> 01:05:40.342
Your hero days are over.

01:05:43.413 --> 01:05:45.447
Unfortunately for you,

01:05:45.449 --> 01:05:48.085
you're up against
the pawesomest tribe ever.

01:06:09.105 --> 01:06:10.407
Ready.

01:06:11.375 --> 01:06:13.108
Aim.

01:06:13.110 --> 01:06:14.412
Fire!

01:06:26.223 --> 01:06:28.723
Mmm.

01:06:28.725 --> 01:06:33.094
Nothing tastes better than ice
cream from your hometown.

01:06:33.096 --> 01:06:35.433
- Yeah! - Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:06:40.337 --> 01:06:42.570
Bad villain. Bad.

01:06:43.572 --> 01:06:46.440
Quick. This way, Scarletta.

01:06:46.442 --> 01:06:49.376
What's she doing?
Bianca's helping her get away.

01:06:49.378 --> 01:06:51.045
Wait. Stop.

01:06:51.047 --> 01:06:52.449
I trust her.

01:06:55.685 --> 01:07:00.221
After all this,
I'm still likable!

01:07:00.223 --> 01:07:03.090
I'll finally get
that award now.

01:07:03.092 --> 01:07:04.525
Yes, sure thing.

01:07:04.527 --> 01:07:07.230
The award ceremony
is right through here.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:15.570
How do you feel about Mistabella winning
the Ultimate Shoppies Choice Golden Award

01:07:15.572 --> 01:07:17.538
for the fourth year
in a row?

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:21.842
Scarletta, is it true that you're
trying to incite war in Pawville?

01:07:21.844 --> 01:07:25.413
What will you do next,
now that your career's over?

01:07:25.415 --> 01:07:26.547
No!

01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:28.449
No!

01:07:28.451 --> 01:07:30.150
And that's a wrap.

01:07:30.152 --> 01:07:32.320
No! No!

01:07:32.322 --> 01:07:35.292
No, no, no!

01:07:36.293 --> 01:07:37.458
Okay,

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:39.360
who wants to guess
what's coming next?

01:07:39.362 --> 01:07:41.596
Party time!
