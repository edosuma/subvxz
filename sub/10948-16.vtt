So twisted-up inside.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.780
You're still full of love.

20:42.910 --> 20:46.830
( SIGHING ) but fear has moved in
where trust should be.

20:46.960 --> 20:51.920
I've been expecting you and
the young Avatar for quite a long time.

20:52.040 --> 20:56.090
I had a vision many years ago
of helping him.

20:56.210 --> 20:59.340
That's why I came to
the Eastern Air Temple.

21:04.010 --> 21:07.600
Oh, your emotions
are so turbulent.

21:07.730 --> 21:10.850
Like swirling storm clouds.

21:12.520 --> 21:16.230
Let the clouds in your mind
be gentle, peaceful ones.

21:35.590 --> 21:37.960
Someone looks very well-rested,

21:38.090 --> 21:40.630
judging by your bed head.

21:40.760 --> 21:41.760
( ROARING )

22:04.830 --> 22:07.450
I have prepared
a message for Aang.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.580
May I attach it to your horn?

22:09.700 --> 22:12.330
( RUMBLING )

22:15.380 --> 22:18.760
You and the Avatar's
energies are mixed.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.590
You have an unbreakable bond.

22:21.720 --> 22:26.600
By reading your energy,
I can sense where Aang is.

22:28.970 --> 22:32.560
Funny, what invisible strings
connect us all.

22:42.030 --> 22:45.370
I'll see you again, great beast.

22:47.830 --> 22:50.200
( RUMBLING )

22:59.670 --> 23:01.920
( RUMBLING )

23:18.110 --> 23:21.150
( PURRING )

23:25.700 --> 23:26.700
