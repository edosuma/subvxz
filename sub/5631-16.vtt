00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.275
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.576 --> 00:10.111
sexually based offenses

00:10.144 --> 00:12.146
are considered especially
heinous.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.448
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.482 --> 00:16.217
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.250 --> 00:17.751
are members of an elite squad

00:17.785 --> 00:19.987
known as the
Special Victims Unit.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.555
These are their stories.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.126
- It's 4:52 a.m.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.527
I'm going into my second hour

00:26.560 --> 00:29.297
of waiting at Bellevue.
[woman coughing]

00:29.330 --> 00:31.199
There's a police officer
assigned to me,

00:31.232 --> 00:33.301
but you can see
she's multitasking.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.335
- [laughs]

00:36.036 --> 00:37.004
- They said it would be a while

00:37.037 --> 00:39.507
until the "SANE nurse"--

00:39.540 --> 00:41.675
Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner--

00:41.709 --> 00:44.578
is free.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.780
My insides hurt so much.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.516
They won't let me
drink anything.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.684
I've been gagging
on the taste of him for hours.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.086
I told them I thought
I was gonna throw up,

00:52.120 --> 00:55.689
and they gave me this.

00:55.723 --> 00:56.890
So...

00:56.924 --> 01:00.194
- Kristi Cryer?
I'm Jen, the SANE nurse.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.263
How are you doing?
- Not good.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.664
Look, I really want some water.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.799
- Okay.
As soon as I swab your mouth.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.402
- I already had a drink
afterwards.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.604
- Even so,
better to hold off.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.806
I know how hard this is.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.243
Follow me.

01:15.276 --> 01:19.613
So we are going
right through here.

01:19.647 --> 01:22.550
So first you need
to change into this.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.552
You can't record anything
in here.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.320
Hospital policy.

01:26.354 --> 01:27.788
- Really?

01:27.821 --> 01:29.190
- Yeah.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.426
- 7:40.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.595
They just finished my rape kit.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.730
They swab everywhere.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.466
- The detectives are here.

01:38.499 --> 01:42.503
- Oh, just a sec.

01:42.536 --> 01:43.771
Okay, come in.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.773
[sniffles]

01:45.806 --> 01:48.309
- Hi, I'm Detective Rollins.

01:48.342 --> 01:51.312
This is Detective Carisi.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.681
Do you prefer Ms. Cryer
or--or Kristi?

01:53.714 --> 01:55.683
- Kristi's fine.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.452
- We understand you were
assaulted tonight, Kristi.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.254
- Can you tell us
what happened?

02:01.522 --> 02:02.623
- [sobs]

02:02.656 --> 02:07.695
I was raped
in a nightclub restroom.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.197
- I'm sorry.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.300
Can you describe your attacker?

02:12.333 --> 02:14.535
- [crying]
Um...short.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.337
Dark hair.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.206
I have his picture
on my phone.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.742
- Wait, I'm--I'm sorry.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.344
Are you recording this?

02:23.377 --> 02:24.712
- I'm a vlogger.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.380
My--my followers
want to know everything

02:26.414 --> 02:28.849
that happens to me.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.784
Sorry, what did you say
your names were?

02:30.818 --> 02:33.521
[somber music]

02:34.822 --> 02:37.791
[dramatic music]

03:21.302 --> 03:21.435
.

03:22.270 --> 03:22.970
- You ask anyone at 1PP,
Hank Abraham

03:23.937 --> 03:25.439
was a political appointee.

03:25.473 --> 03:26.874
He was never one of us.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.776
No one's losing any sleep
over him.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.512
- Well, we all did.

03:31.545 --> 03:35.416
I don't think
I've ever known anyone so...

03:35.449 --> 03:37.184
compartmentalized.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.586
- It's the lies
we tell ourselves

03:38.619 --> 03:40.954
to get through the day.
Anyhow...

03:40.988 --> 03:43.291
My son has learned a lot
under you.

03:43.324 --> 03:46.660
- He works hard.
He's...a good cop.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.529
- So you agree.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.563
You know it's time
that he took on

03:49.597 --> 03:51.799
a more high-profile role.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.335
- Joint Terrorism?
He mentioned that.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.770
- All I'm asking
is when the time comes,

03:56.804 --> 03:58.906
give him your best
recommendation.

03:58.939 --> 04:02.643
- You don't even need to ask,
Chief.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.646
[club music]
- Morning, Sergeant.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.715
How's your first day back
so far?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.550
- Right in the thick of it.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.218
- Right, isn't that
Bobby D'Amico?

04:11.319 --> 04:12.553
- The TV actor, yeah.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.788
- She was assaulted
at his club last night.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.525
- Bobby D's Hideaway?
And she recorded it?

04:17.558 --> 04:19.327
- Yeah, this is from
the beginning of her evening.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.594
She's a vlogger.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.530
- A vlogger,
and she accused a date?

04:22.563 --> 04:26.667
- No, actually, she accused
the bar manager, Noel Panko.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.236
Our vic says he followed her
into the bathroom,

04:29.337 --> 04:30.471
raped her, sodomized her.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.639
- I'll put in a call in
to Bobby.

04:31.672 --> 04:34.241
See what he knows
about this guy.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.709
- You know Bobby D'Amico?

04:35.743 --> 04:37.345
- Bobby's a friend
of the department.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.946
- Translation:
He bought the brass

04:38.979 --> 04:40.481
a lot of Nobu dinners

04:40.514 --> 04:42.350
when he was researching his part
for Jack Byrnes.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.718
- Ah, right, right--
the morally-conflicted D.A.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.587
turned bad boy rogue cop?

04:46.620 --> 04:47.588
- [laughs]

04:47.621 --> 04:49.357
Bobby's good people.

04:49.357 --> 04:50.858
Anytime there's a benefit
for the widows and orphans,

04:50.891 --> 04:52.560
he is on that podium.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.894
- That's good to know,
but for the meantime,

04:53.927 --> 04:56.196
why don't we hold off
on calling him.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.831
- But keep in mind,
people look at a celeb,

04:57.865 --> 04:59.967
and they see an easy payday.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.507
- Oh, that was subtle.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.709
- So Bobby D'Amico's a friend
of your father's.

05:08.742 --> 05:09.943
Yours, too?

05:09.977 --> 05:11.779
- I know him.
Not a fan.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.013
- Okay.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.516
So Kristi was at the bar
with a friend?

05:15.549 --> 05:16.917
- Yeah.
- She disclose to her?

05:16.950 --> 05:19.553
- No, it was
the girlfriend's birthday,

05:19.587 --> 05:21.655
and Kristi didn't want to
ruin her night.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.858
- Well, it's the morning after.
Find out what the friend saw.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.697
- Kristi was raped?

05:29.730 --> 05:30.864
- You don't follow her vlog?

05:30.898 --> 05:33.066
- No, but I was with her
last night.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.603
- At Bobby D's.
How long did you stay?

05:35.636 --> 05:37.771
- Till after 3:00.
I put her in a cab.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.973
- Okay, before that, you two
were together the whole night?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.842
- Yeah.
Well, wait.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.911
I did go out a couple of times
for a smoke.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.646
- You remember what time
that was?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.481
- After 2:00 at least.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.417
They were playing
Billy Joel by then.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.984
- And did Kristi
seem any different

05:51.018 --> 05:53.721
when you came back in?
- Not really.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.055
We were both pretty drunk.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.624
- Do you remember anybody
making eyes at her,

05:56.657 --> 05:58.926
maybe getting grabby?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.461
- No one creepy.

06:00.494 --> 06:01.629
We were mostly at the bar.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.564
The manager--Noel something--

06:03.597 --> 06:04.665
he might be able to help you.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.734
- Noel Panko?
Short, with a beard?

06:06.767 --> 06:09.069
- Yeah.
He was attentive.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.772
You go to a bar with Kristi,
you never pay for drinks.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.007
Even Bobby D'Amico
was flirting.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.609
Kristi danced with him.

06:15.643 --> 06:18.912
They kind of made out a little.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.484
- Henry, Henry.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.918
[speaking French]

06:24.952 --> 06:26.554
The resistance...

06:26.587 --> 06:27.721
is coming towards the front.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.691
- No, Louis.
They are here.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.560
I am with them.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.894
This is America.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.730
We'll never speak French.

06:36.764 --> 06:37.998
- Cut!
[bell rings]

06:38.031 --> 06:40.801
Let's set up the next shot
with blood packs.

06:40.834 --> 06:41.969
- Bobby.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.872
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.840
This, uh, this looks good.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.676
- Oh, "Napoleon in America."

06:48.709 --> 06:52.012
The concept is,
what if Napoleon invaded us

06:52.045 --> 06:53.380
instead of Russia?

06:53.481 --> 06:55.315
I lead the resistance.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.050
We start streaming
in the fall.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.886
Netflix.
- Huh.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.489
Anyway, the reason I called,
uh...

07:01.489 --> 07:03.056
- Yeah.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.627
- There may have been some
trouble at your club last night.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.162
- Really?
I was there the whole time.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.131
- What about your manager,
Noel Panko?

07:11.164 --> 07:12.933
What can you tell me
about him?

07:12.966 --> 07:14.602
- I can tell you
when he lost his virginity.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.604
We grew up together
in Union City.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.071
- And how long has he been
working at your bar?

07:18.105 --> 07:20.173
- Since we opened.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.876
What are you asking
about Noel for?

07:22.910 --> 07:25.579
Come on, I played a cop
for ten seasons.

07:25.613 --> 07:29.116
Don't dance around.
What's up?

07:29.149 --> 07:30.984
- Do you recognize this girl?

07:31.018 --> 07:32.986
- Yeah, she was at the bar
last night.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.254
It was her friend's birthday.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.789
- And you and Panko
bought her drinks?

07:35.823 --> 07:38.158
- Well, never hurts to have
a pretty girl at the bar.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.527
What's she saying?

07:39.527 --> 07:41.294
- Well,
you tell me your side.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.532
- Okay. She's a freak.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.866
- Meaning?

07:45.899 --> 07:48.702
- Meaning we danced,
we made out,

07:48.736 --> 07:51.238
and then we went and made
beautiful love in the bathroom

07:51.271 --> 07:52.540
for three minutes.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.108
- Wait, you had sex
with this girl?

07:55.142 --> 07:57.044
- Totally consensual.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.445
- Just you and her?

07:58.546 --> 08:00.714
- At first, and then Noel
came looking for me,

08:00.748 --> 08:04.051
and she took care of him too.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.386
- And she was fine
with all that?

08:06.419 --> 08:07.955
- She's a big fan,

08:07.988 --> 08:10.457
and this definitely
was not her first tag team.

08:10.558 --> 08:13.561
If she's complaining now,
it's a shakedown.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.563
*

08:15.563 --> 08:18.198
- One big, happy, consensual
three-way in the bathroom.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.768
- Yeah, D'Amico
wasn't shy about it.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.803
- He and Panko
are childhood friends, though.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.337
He's covering for his buddy.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.840
- Yeah, or she's leaving out
a big part of the story.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.042
Look, Bobby's not a dummy,
right?

08:29.076 --> 08:31.111
He's not going to put himself
in the bathroom with her

08:31.144 --> 08:32.279
if he wasn't there.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.814
- Yeah, okay--
- And let's--and let--

08:33.847 --> 08:35.482
Let's--let's remember
that her own friend said

08:35.583 --> 08:37.585
that she was dancing after she
claims to have been assaulted.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.187
- Hold on, Carisi, we all know
that her affect afterwards

08:40.220 --> 08:41.622
doesn't mean anything.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.592
Even if she did have
consensual sex with D'Amico--

08:44.592 --> 08:45.926
- And left that out.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.995
- Panko still could have
assaulted her.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.430
Look, Dodds and I
will talk to him.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.032
In the meantime,
bring Kristi in,

08:52.065 --> 08:54.602
and find out what else
she's not telling us.

08:56.469 --> 08:59.673
- Yeah, Bobby called me.
What is this girl's problem?

08:59.707 --> 09:02.142
- My guess is she's mad
you didn't send flowers,

09:02.175 --> 09:03.977
but she did go
to the emergency room,

09:04.011 --> 09:06.046
so my boss and I,
we need to follow up.

09:06.079 --> 09:09.382
- So how do you think
she might have gotten hurt?

09:09.416 --> 09:10.618
- I don't know.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.920
You got three people
in a small, tiled bathroom.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.823
Wild things happen
to wild things. [scoffs]

09:15.856 --> 09:19.292
- So she was into it,
like Bobby says?

09:19.326 --> 09:21.895
- Yeah. I mean,
Bobby's catnip to the ladies.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.864
They come in here
hoping for a moment.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.498
- Right, right,
but we're talking

09:25.532 --> 09:26.700
about you, Mr. Panko.

09:26.734 --> 09:29.903
So how much will they do
for you?

09:29.937 --> 09:31.705
- Well, I get my share
of the runoff.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.273
Why, what is she saying?

09:33.306 --> 09:34.775
- Bobby told us
you walked in on 'em.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.644
- Yeah, I mean,
I went looking for him,

09:36.644 --> 09:37.911
and I saw that he was busy,

09:37.945 --> 09:40.013
and she invited me to stay.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.649
- She did?

09:41.649 --> 09:42.883
What did she say,
exactly?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.752
- Uh...I don't--

09:44.785 --> 09:46.887
I mean, maybe it was Bobby
who said it.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.856
But look, he--he--he tells
his fans to go down,

09:48.889 --> 09:51.391
and they say, "How low?"

09:51.424 --> 09:52.826
- "How low?"

09:52.860 --> 09:54.194
- You think I'm lying?

09:54.227 --> 09:55.829
- Bobby told us you have
security cameras above the bar.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.530
We're gonna need to see
that footage.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.299
- Yeah, we're also gonna need
the cameras out

09:59.332 --> 10:01.301
from the hallway,
out in front of the bathroom.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.602
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you can take it all.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.204
Look, she was here
till the last call,

10:04.237 --> 10:06.373
I mean,
twerking the entire night.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.382
- Okay, I went into the bathroom
with Bobby.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.917
I didn't tell you,

10:16.950 --> 10:18.686
because I didn't want you
to think I was a slut.

10:18.719 --> 10:21.554
- You need to be completely
honest with us, okay, Kristi?

10:21.588 --> 10:23.456
Everything you say
or don't say

10:23.490 --> 10:24.758
can be brought up at trial.

10:24.792 --> 10:25.759
- Okay, I get it.

10:25.793 --> 10:26.760
I--I'm sorry.

10:26.794 --> 10:27.761
- All right.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.296
So full disclosure.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.832
Did you have consensual sex
with Bobby?

10:31.865 --> 10:33.566
- Just oral.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.468
- And then what happened?

10:35.502 --> 10:38.138
- Noel came in
like he knew we were there.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.572
- And you were okay
with that?

10:39.606 --> 10:40.874
- Not really,

10:40.908 --> 10:43.443
but Bobby asked
if Noel could join us,

10:43.476 --> 10:45.813
and I said no,
and then Bobby said,

10:45.846 --> 10:47.748
"Look at those puppy eyes.
You hurt his feelings."

10:47.781 --> 10:49.382
- That's too cheesy
for her to make up.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.951
- How do we know that?

10:50.984 --> 10:53.453
I'm not sure this girl
has any grip on reality at all.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.922
- Please?

10:54.955 --> 10:57.190
- I wasn't into it,
but Noel wouldn't leave.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.225
- So you went along?

10:58.258 --> 11:00.293
- No. I...

11:00.327 --> 11:01.361
Look, I was pretty drunk.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.996
I don't remember everything.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.398
I heard the door open,
and Bobby was gone.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.967
- So Bobby left,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.636
and--and Panko stayed?

11:09.737 --> 11:12.339
- I was rinsing my face,

11:12.372 --> 11:14.507
and Noel pushed me
onto the sink,

11:14.541 --> 11:18.278
and he raped me from behind.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.880
What, you don't believe me?

11:19.913 --> 11:22.750
- We need to make sure
the timeline is clear.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.884
Now, the video does show

11:23.917 --> 11:25.452
that Bobby
left the bathroom first.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.054
- The problem is,
ten minutes later,

11:27.087 --> 11:29.589
you're on the dance floor
with your friend,

11:29.622 --> 11:31.458
acting like nothing happened.

11:31.491 --> 11:34.527
[dramatic music]

11:34.561 --> 11:36.764
- I told you,
it was Sheila's birthday.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.431
I didn't want to...

11:38.465 --> 11:41.368
bum her out.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.436
Noel raped me.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.772
I swear to God.

11:44.772 --> 11:45.973
[knocking at window]

11:46.006 --> 11:48.842
- Kristi, can you give us
a minute?

11:48.876 --> 11:53.646
*

11:53.680 --> 11:55.783
- Full house, huh?

11:55.816 --> 11:57.350
- I know.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.651
I--I know this looks bad.

11:58.685 --> 11:59.820
- Bad?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.621
She's a train wreck.
- Dad.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.556
- Look, she's not
the most credible victim,

12:03.590 --> 12:06.526
but I definitely think
something happened to her.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.694
- Probably a lot of things.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.062
It's a they-said, she-said.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.530
She changed her story,
and she went on dancing

12:10.563 --> 12:11.799
after the alleged assault.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.633
- None of that means
she wasn't raped.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.468
- Well, nobody's saying that.
- The Chief is, actually.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.070
- Counselor.
- Mm-hmm?

12:17.104 --> 12:19.606
- If the jury sees
an attention-seeking vlogger

12:19.639 --> 12:21.708
pull a TV star
into the bathroom

12:21.809 --> 12:22.976
and then sees her partying

12:23.010 --> 12:25.645
ten minutes
after she was supposedly raped,

12:25.678 --> 12:27.047
how would that play?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.481
- Not well.
- We've taken on tougher cases.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.917
- We have to pick our battles.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.584
- Rollins, this girl's story
is compromised.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.720
- All right, hold up.
What if we find a pattern?

12:33.821 --> 12:35.388
- That's up to the lieutenant.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.357
- Actually, it's up to me.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.659
There's a difference between
proactivity and harassment.

12:39.692 --> 12:42.462
- Okay, so what do you propose
that I say to this girl?

12:42.495 --> 12:43.831
- Tell her we're sorry,

12:43.831 --> 12:45.833
but the D.A.
won't move forward.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.968
Get her a ride home.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.012
- These are
the hardest conversations

12:59.046 --> 13:03.750
that I have to have.

13:03.851 --> 13:06.854
There's not enough evidence
to make an arrest.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.856
*

13:08.856 --> 13:11.624
- [crying]

13:11.658 --> 13:14.094
I was raped.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.363
- Yeah.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.765
- Don't you believe me?
- Yes, I do, Kristi.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.033
I do;
I absolutely do,

13:20.067 --> 13:22.735
but the--the question is,

13:22.769 --> 13:25.405
can we prove it
beyond a reasonable doubt?

13:25.438 --> 13:27.507
- I should have--

13:27.540 --> 13:29.009
I never should have said
anything at the hospital.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.677
- Listen, that evidence...

13:30.710 --> 13:33.981
your rape kit stays on file.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.716
Your case stays open,

13:36.749 --> 13:38.952
and we can provide you
with medical treatment,

13:38.986 --> 13:40.553
with counseling.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.655
- I was so stupid.

13:42.689 --> 13:47.995
I was so excited to have
a big star interested in me.

13:48.028 --> 13:51.899
- You didn't deserve
what happened to you.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.466
Kristi,

13:53.500 --> 13:56.636
none of this was your fault.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.339
- If you say so.

13:59.372 --> 14:02.275
[dramatic music]

14:02.309 --> 14:05.045
*

14:05.078 --> 14:09.216
- Okay, Dad.
Thanks.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.718
Bobby D'Amico
says he owes us one.

14:11.751 --> 14:13.586
- Oh, great.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.455
- So what,
case closed?

14:15.488 --> 14:16.456
- Certainly looks like it.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.525
- Now, hold up.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.927
I mean, I know this girl
is a hot mess,

14:19.927 --> 14:21.794
but does Chief Dodds
really think

14:21.828 --> 14:23.630
that she cried rape
for attention?

14:23.663 --> 14:26.499
- She is a 24/7 vlogger.
- That's the thing.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.002
I've been going through
her posts--three years' worth--

14:29.036 --> 14:31.104
and she has partied
with a lot of celebs.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.505
She posts all the pics.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.207
She wants everybody to think
that she's having fun.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.209
- Well, not anymore.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.946
Her latest vlog
just went viral.

14:41.982 --> 14:45.152
- You all saw me in the ER,

14:45.185 --> 14:48.621
but I didn't tell
the whole story.

14:48.655 --> 14:52.192
I was gang-raped
at Bobby D's by Noel Panko...

14:52.225 --> 14:56.463
and Bobby D'Amico.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.199
I told the police
that I was raped,

14:59.232 --> 15:02.635
including Lieutenant
Olivia Benson of the SVU.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.737
She told me
that she believed me,

15:04.771 --> 15:08.875
that it wasn't my fault...

15:08.976 --> 15:12.112
but that no one
would be arrested or charged.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.081
[crying]

15:14.114 --> 15:16.516
I may be a special victim,

15:16.549 --> 15:18.818
but to SVU,

15:18.851 --> 15:22.489
I'm not as special
as Bobby D'Amico.

15:22.522 --> 15:25.525
[somber music]

15:31.031 --> 15:31.164
.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.000
- She's out of control, Bill.
First she accuses Noel,

15:34.767 --> 15:36.769
then she throws my name
in the garbage?

15:36.803 --> 15:39.339
I got a Golden Globe.
I went to Yale.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.640
I don't deserve this.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.542
- She blindsided all of us.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.011
As of yesterday,
the District Attorney

15:44.011 --> 15:45.312
had elected not to proceed.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.014
- So she accuses me?

15:47.014 --> 15:50.317
Throws my name in the gar--
you saw that video.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.053
- No one's questioning
whether it started consensually.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.722
- You're actually gonna take
that nutjob seriously?

15:55.755 --> 15:58.525
That vlog pissed on you guys
as much as it pissed on me.

15:58.558 --> 16:03.030
- Yes, it did, and we are
talking to Kristi right now.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.664
- I'm at over 100,000
followers.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.067
People want to know
what those two did.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.238
- Kristi, it would have been
a lot better

16:11.271 --> 16:13.440
if you would've told us
and not your followers

16:13.473 --> 16:15.508
that you were also raped
by Bobby D'Amico.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.876
- Why?
It's pretty obvious to everyone

16:16.909 --> 16:17.944
that you're looking out
for him.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.546
Did you even read
the comments on my vlog?

16:19.579 --> 16:21.214
- I get that you're--
you're worried

16:21.248 --> 16:23.183
about accusing a celebrity.

16:23.216 --> 16:26.186
I get that, but--please.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.623
This is your last chance.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.627
You've got to tell us
exactly what happened.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.529
- Okay.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.168
It's like I said.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.536
I was giving Bobby oral
when Noel came in.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.272
Bobby asked
if Noel could join us.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.839
I said I wasn't into that,

16:46.873 --> 16:49.876
so Bobby said, "You're gonna
hurt his feelings."

16:49.909 --> 16:52.912
I--I told Bobby
I wanted to go back upstairs.

16:52.945 --> 16:55.682
- And then what happened?
- Bobby got mad.

16:55.715 --> 16:56.949
He said I couldn't leave him
like that,

16:56.983 --> 16:58.485
that I had to finish
what I'd started.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.354
He pushed my head down
until he was done.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.922
- And Noel Panko
was still there?

17:02.955 --> 17:04.857
- He was watching,

17:04.891 --> 17:06.959
and then Bobby left,
and I went to the sink,

17:06.993 --> 17:11.098
and Noel pushed into me
from behind and raped me.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.099
- All I know is,
when I was there,

17:12.132 --> 17:13.633
it was totally consensual.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.603
- The video shows Noel stayed
a few minutes after you left.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.538
- I'm sure that
whatever he did

17:18.571 --> 17:19.606
she wanted him to do.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.541
- Okay,
so how can you be sure?

17:21.574 --> 17:22.609
Right?

17:22.642 --> 17:24.744
What did she say, exactly,

17:24.777 --> 17:26.113
when Noel walked in?

17:26.113 --> 17:27.514
- Her exact words?
- Yes.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.749
- I don't know.
Her head was in my lap.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.017
- Excuse me?

17:31.118 --> 17:32.719
- Okay, let's all take
a step back here,

17:32.752 --> 17:35.522
and, Bobby, you should
probably have this conversation

17:35.555 --> 17:37.124
with your lawyer present.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.191
- That's a good idea.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.692
They need me
back on set, anyway.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.362
You need me,
you know where to find me.

17:42.395 --> 17:47.667
*

17:47.700 --> 17:49.336
- Why would you have him
lawyer up

17:49.369 --> 17:51.138
when he's giving
a voluntary statement?

17:51.138 --> 17:53.140
- And she's making
public accusations.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.841
He could be as much
of a victim as she is.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.476
- Okay,
can we get some clarity

17:56.509 --> 17:58.145
on how we're supposed
to respond here?

17:58.178 --> 17:59.679
- We already agreed
not to press charges.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.715
- Yes, that was before
she named another rapist.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.717
- So Rollins and Carisi
take a revised statement,

18:04.751 --> 18:07.454
and we reassure the public
we're investigating,

18:07.487 --> 18:09.389
but let's be real here.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.225
The sooner this goes away,
the better.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.726
- I'm not taking down my vlog.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.628
- Well, can you at least
put your phone down?

18:15.662 --> 18:18.531
- No. My followers
are being very supportive.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.635
Here's something.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.337
Another accusation.

18:24.371 --> 18:27.307
Told you I wasn't lying.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.808
- What?

18:28.841 --> 18:30.743
"Thank you for being
so brave, Kristi.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.579
"You're not alone.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.946
"I was attacked by Bobby D'Amico

18:33.980 --> 18:35.782
"and his disgusting friend,
Noel, last fall.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.684
Those two are pigs."

18:37.717 --> 18:39.886
- This is from
one of your followers?

18:39.919 --> 18:43.690
*

18:43.723 --> 18:44.757
- Tara Browne?

18:44.791 --> 18:46.293
- Yes?

18:46.326 --> 18:47.760
- We'd like to talk to you
about some comments

18:47.794 --> 18:50.197
you posted online.
- On Kristi Cryer's vlog.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.464
- That post was anonymous.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.200
Aren't I protected
by privacy laws?

18:53.233 --> 18:54.834
- Well, I guess you didn't read
your user agreement.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.204
Listen, it sounded like you
really wanted to help Kristi.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.205
Do you?

18:58.205 --> 19:00.373
- Look, I just feel bad for her.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.108
I went through what
she went through.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.810
- It said in the post
that you were assaulted

19:03.843 --> 19:05.812
by Bobby D'Amico
and Noel Panko.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.014
Was that at Bobby D's?
- Yeah, last year.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.916
- Can you tell us more
about that?

19:09.949 --> 19:13.853
- I was kind of
going down on Bobby.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.523
The door opened,
and it was Noel Panko,

19:16.556 --> 19:18.525
like he knew
we were in there.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.827
- What did Bobby say?

19:20.860 --> 19:23.363
- He asked if I would
take care of Panko.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.765
- Do you remember
what he said exactly?

19:25.798 --> 19:28.401
- After I said no, he said,

19:28.435 --> 19:31.371
"Aw, look at those puppy eyes.
You hurt his feelings."

19:31.404 --> 19:34.307
*

19:34.341 --> 19:35.608
Look, I wanted to
get out of there.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.711
I tried.
They wouldn't let me.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.814
Bobby pushed my head down,
and Panko...

19:41.848 --> 19:43.650
he raped me from behind.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.918
- Why didn't you go
to the police?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.487
- I was drunk.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.955
I went into the bathroom
with Bobby.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.591
I didn't think anyone
would believe me.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.526
I saw Kristi's vlog,
and I just wanted her to know

19:53.560 --> 19:54.527
she wasn't crazy.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.796
- Well,
what Kristi really needs

19:56.829 --> 19:59.632
is for you to go to the D.A.
and tell this story.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.201
- Would you be willing
to testify?

20:02.235 --> 20:03.970
- You mean
like in court?

20:04.003 --> 20:05.438
Yeah, I don't think
I can do that.

20:05.472 --> 20:06.906
I--I don't want to
lose my job.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.676
- Tara, most employers
understand.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.278
- Not mine.

20:11.311 --> 20:14.481
*

20:14.514 --> 20:16.449
- You found a second victim,
but she works for Bobby D'Amico?

20:16.483 --> 20:17.684
- No, not for him,

20:17.717 --> 20:19.452
but she is a P.A.
on his Netflix series.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.887
- Right, so basically,
she took a payoff.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.589
- It makes sense
if he and Panko raped her.

20:22.622 --> 20:23.823
- And explains why she didn't go
to the cops.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.292
- Which also doesn't help us.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.759
It was six months ago,
no disclosure.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.296
- Look, her story is consistent
with Kristi's.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.431
I mean, down to details
that weren't on the vlog.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.500
- I mean, these guys probably
do this every weekend, right?

20:33.533 --> 20:35.635
I mean, Bobby targets
the cutest girl in the bar,

20:35.668 --> 20:37.504
gets her drunk,
gets her to do Noel, too.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.506
- Yeah, nine times out of ten,
the girl goes along with it,

20:39.539 --> 20:41.408
but if one doesn't, these guys
don't take no for an answer.

20:41.441 --> 20:42.975
- Okay, okay, I'm not--wow.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.044
I'm not saying these guys
aren't despicable,

20:45.077 --> 20:47.414
but I am saying
I still can't prosecute.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.516
- Okay, hang on, Barba.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.451
Have any other girls
spoken up?

20:51.484 --> 20:53.686
- No, 'cause Kristi had to
close down the comment section.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.588
All that love turned to hate.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.357
- Any calls to the precinct?

20:57.390 --> 20:58.991
- Look, it's early still.
Right?

20:59.025 --> 21:01.694
We all know how difficult it is
for victims to come forward.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.564
- Well, until they do,
we don't have a case.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.001
- I'm calling it a night.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.837
Don't you have a baby at home?

21:10.870 --> 21:12.372
- I got a great nanny,

21:12.405 --> 21:13.740
but thanks for asking.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.742
- Sorry.
I got a lot of respect.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.110
It just must be tough,
being a working mother.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.812
- You know what's tough?

21:19.846 --> 21:21.948
Two asshats
getting away with rape.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.916
- Okay, when there's no case,
there's no case.

21:23.950 --> 21:24.917
The victim compromised
herself.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.453
- Yeah,
but they saw her coming.

21:26.486 --> 21:27.687
They got her drunk;
they played to her ego,

21:27.720 --> 21:28.855
her wild streak,
got her to come--

21:28.888 --> 21:30.590
- Yeah, you mean
her crazy streak?

21:30.623 --> 21:32.892
I mean, you do know
that she's unstable, right?

21:32.925 --> 21:35.395
- Yeah, okay, right.
I get that.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.929
You probably think
I have a blind spot

21:36.963 --> 21:38.365
because of my sister.

21:38.365 --> 21:39.532
Right?
- What? No.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.100
No, not at all.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.636
- 'Cause you do know
that these two guys are guilty,

21:43.670 --> 21:47.039
including
your dad's friend Bobby.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.074
- You think I'm a daddy's boy.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.075
- No, I don't.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.477
- Right.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.379
Bobby D'Amico
is no friend of mine,

21:52.379 --> 21:53.746
but until these two
get caught in the act,

21:53.780 --> 21:55.648
they're gonna keep
getting away with it.

21:55.682 --> 21:59.386
- And I guess you're just fine
with that.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.654
- Why don't you clock out,
go home?

22:01.688 --> 22:03.623
- Why don't you stop telling me
what to do...

22:03.656 --> 22:05.124
Sergeant?

22:15.635 --> 22:17.437
- Okay, another shot.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.071
both: On the house.
- Thank you, sir.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.773
- My mama is gonna flip

22:20.807 --> 22:22.775
when she finds out
that I met you.

22:22.809 --> 22:25.111
- Oh. She here with you
in New York?

22:25.144 --> 22:28.548
- What kind of vacation
would that be?

22:28.581 --> 22:30.116
[dance music]

22:30.149 --> 22:32.018
- It's a busy city.

22:32.051 --> 22:35.622
Girl could get into trouble.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.424
- Boys.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.792
I mean,
no matter what age,

22:39.826 --> 22:42.829
y'all just never figure out
that some women like trouble.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.764
- Oh...

22:44.797 --> 22:47.700
[tense music]

22:57.444 --> 22:57.544
.

22:58.277 --> 23:00.847
- [breathing heavily]

23:02.181 --> 23:03.550
[groans]

23:03.583 --> 23:05.184
- [laughs]

23:05.217 --> 23:08.120
- Oh...look.
Listen...

23:08.154 --> 23:09.456
No, no, no.
I'm sorry, I for--

23:09.489 --> 23:12.559
I forgot to tell you.
I have a boyfriend back home.

23:12.592 --> 23:13.826
- Oh, it's okay.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.762
I'll keep my lips sealed
if you won't.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.964
- I can't--
[knock at door]

23:17.997 --> 23:19.766
Excuse us.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.100
- You two have met.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.935
- Hey.

23:22.969 --> 23:26.573
- You want a really good story
to take home?

23:26.606 --> 23:28.140
- Me?
What kind of story?

23:28.174 --> 23:29.676
- I think you know.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.010
Right?

23:31.043 --> 23:32.612
- I--no, no, no.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.981
I want to--
I want to go back upstairs.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.048
- Uh-uh, not yet.
Not yet.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.084
- [gasps]

23:38.117 --> 23:40.052
No, no.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.088
- Those puppy eyes.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.791
You can't hurt his feelings.

23:44.824 --> 23:45.892
- [grunts]
No, no.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.494
I--I said no.

23:47.494 --> 23:48.961
- "No," as in you know...
- Ow.

23:48.995 --> 23:49.962
- You want this.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.498
Come on, baby...
- No.

23:51.498 --> 23:53.500
- This is what
you came in here for.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.734
- Hey--

23:54.767 --> 23:55.735
[grunts]

23:55.768 --> 23:57.036
- Huh?
- Okay.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.605
- You make one move,
and I will snap your arm.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.006
- Okay.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.141
- Oh, God.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.143
- [grunts]

24:04.176 --> 24:06.646
Okay, I'm sorry
if you misunderstood.

24:06.679 --> 24:09.916
- I didn't misunderstand
anything.

24:09.949 --> 24:10.950
- [grunts]

24:17.824 --> 24:18.858
Hey.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.993
Hey.
- Stay away from me.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.595
- I'm sorry about my friend,
okay?

24:22.629 --> 24:24.130
- [scoffs]

24:24.163 --> 24:25.898
What the hell
are you doing here?

24:25.932 --> 24:27.033
- I had a feeling
you weren't going home.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.568
- You followed me?

24:28.601 --> 24:30.202
- Mike, good to see you.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.638
You two know each other?

24:31.671 --> 24:32.705
- No.
- Yeah.

24:32.739 --> 24:34.373
Yeah, we do.
We work together.

24:34.406 --> 24:36.543
- You a cop?

24:36.543 --> 24:37.810
- Yep.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.948
Now, I was gonna wait
until tomorrow, but...

24:41.981 --> 24:44.116
you're under arrest
for attempted rape.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.253
[dramatic music]

24:47.286 --> 24:48.988
- So you want me to take 'em
down to the station?

24:49.021 --> 24:50.923
- Yes.
- No.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.324
Just give us a second.

24:52.358 --> 24:53.893
- I'm s--Dodds.
What--what are you doing?

24:53.926 --> 24:55.895
Just butt out.
This is my collar.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.765
- Rollins,
you can't arrest him.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.432
- I'm sorry, why?

25:00.466 --> 25:02.134
Why,
'cause your father said so?

25:02.168 --> 25:03.570
- No, because
you went undercover

25:03.570 --> 25:05.304
without authorization...
- Detectives.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.573
- On an open investigation

25:06.573 --> 25:09.876
when the suspect was already
lawyered up.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.410
- What? When did that happen?

25:11.443 --> 25:14.280
- When his dad told him to
this morning.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.450
- Son of a bitch.

25:18.484 --> 25:20.452
- So, setting a honey trap
for my client,

25:20.486 --> 25:22.755
or is this what new mothers
are wearing these days?

25:22.789 --> 25:24.791
- You know what?
Save it, Counselor.

25:24.824 --> 25:27.326
- Given your unseemly
tactics,

25:27.359 --> 25:29.461
unless you take those cuffs
off my clients,

25:29.495 --> 25:32.164
NYPD is facing
a major lawsuit.

25:32.198 --> 25:35.602
*

25:35.602 --> 25:37.604
- Let 'em out of there.

25:37.604 --> 25:40.039
- Seriously?

25:40.072 --> 25:41.674
- They're not off the hook.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.610
We're gonna take this up
with Barba tomorrow.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.277
- Yeah.

25:45.311 --> 25:46.412
You okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

25:46.445 --> 25:47.513
- All right.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.415
- I want to go back upstairs.

25:49.448 --> 25:50.817
- Not yet.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.620
Come on.
Come on, look at my friend.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.521
Look at those puppy eyes.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.489
You can't hurt his feelings.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.859
- No. I said no.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.293
[TV clicks off]

26:01.327 --> 26:02.995
- You used yourself as bait?

26:03.029 --> 26:04.330
- Uh, yeah.

26:04.363 --> 26:05.898
Dodds said if we didn't
catch these two in the act,

26:05.932 --> 26:07.233
then they were gonna walk.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.768
- Oh, so this was his idea?

26:08.801 --> 26:10.937
And now I have to hear
from your father,

26:10.970 --> 26:13.640
the Deputy Chief,
that two members of my squad

26:13.640 --> 26:15.174
went completely rogue on me.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.243
- We're here now.
This is pretty damning video.

26:17.276 --> 26:18.945
- Except it's more prejudicial
than probative,

26:18.978 --> 26:20.680
and they'd already invoked
their right to counsel.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.749
- All right, well, technically
cops are not allowed to talk

26:22.782 --> 26:24.684
to them without their lawyers
present, right?

26:24.717 --> 26:27.219
What if, while the cops
are illegally talking to them,

26:27.253 --> 26:28.520
they commit a crime?

26:28.554 --> 26:30.857
- That's fun question
for a bar exam.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.725
Any judge would throw this out.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.294
- Are we talking about Detective
Rollins' antics last night?

26:35.327 --> 26:36.696
Bobby D'Amico called me

26:36.729 --> 26:38.397
to tell me
that you came on to him.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.232
- No, they tried to rape me.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.301
- It does look bad, Chief.

26:42.334 --> 26:43.703
- You know you want this.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.471
- I mean, it's the same M.O.
as Kristi.

26:45.504 --> 26:47.807
- Same M.O. as the other victim
we found, too.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.342
- The one who won't testify.
- Kristi will testify.

26:50.376 --> 26:51.844
- You sure you want to walk
into a court

26:51.878 --> 26:53.846
with an online ranter
as your only witness?

26:53.880 --> 26:55.915
- I can talk to her again,
See if she's up for it.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.416
- You know what?
We both will.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.719
- Make sure
she doesn't record it.

27:07.593 --> 27:09.128
- I'm gonna need your phone.

27:10.429 --> 27:11.430
Is it off?

27:11.463 --> 27:12.431
- Yes, it's off.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.801
- Trust, but verify.
Purse too.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.336
- I'll hold it for you
until you're done.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.305
- Sit down.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.140
- There, you can sit here.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.142
- So, you're the D.A.
who said there isn't enough

27:23.175 --> 27:24.343
for my case to proceed.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.512
- Uh-huh, I am.
Now I'm reconsidering.

27:26.545 --> 27:28.715
- Reconsidering?

27:28.715 --> 27:30.717
Oh, now you believe me?
- Kristi.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.251
I'm on your side here.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.286
- Yeah, well, he isn't.
- Can you blame me?

27:34.320 --> 27:35.722
Right now,
we need to find out

27:35.722 --> 27:37.189
just what kind of a witness
you'd be.

27:37.223 --> 27:38.925
- I always tell the truth.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.559
- [scoffs]
Seriously?

27:40.592 --> 27:42.762
- Why did you even ask me
down here?

27:42.795 --> 27:45.231
What, to tell me
it's impossible?

27:45.264 --> 27:46.565
- We asked you down here
to give you a taste

27:46.598 --> 27:48.735
of what a trial's gonna
be like.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.470
- Look...

27:51.503 --> 27:53.806
you didn't tell us
the whole truth.

27:53.840 --> 27:57.276
You vlogged
public accusations.

27:57.309 --> 27:58.945
Now, we understand
that you were frustrated,

27:58.978 --> 28:01.981
but...that looks bad.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.316
- The defense is gonna attack
your misstatements,

28:04.350 --> 28:07.586
your lifestyle,
your penchant for publicity.

28:07.619 --> 28:12.759
- I didn't get myself raped
so I could put it online.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.493
What those two did
in that bathroom

28:14.526 --> 28:17.764
is the worst thing
that has ever happened to me.

28:17.797 --> 28:22.001
*

28:22.034 --> 28:24.937
I want to look them in the eye

28:24.971 --> 28:28.808
while the jury hears
what they did to me.

28:36.783 --> 28:36.883
.

28:37.583 --> 28:38.584
- All these cameras,
I'm surprised Kristi's not here.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.788
- Yeah, well, I think Barba
set some ground rules.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.022
- This is gonna be
a tough case for him.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.623
- I give him credit
for bringing it at all.

28:44.656 --> 28:47.293
I mean, Barba's getting
a lot of heat from 1PP.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.795
- Speaking of heat--listen,

28:48.795 --> 28:50.462
I know it's none
of my business, Lieutenant,

28:50.496 --> 28:52.398
but Rollins and Dodds--
they got your message.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.033
Hey, can I get
a kaiser roll with butter

28:54.066 --> 28:55.101
and two coffees, please?

28:55.134 --> 28:56.702
- Okay, first of all,

28:56.803 --> 28:58.537
Dodds was just covering
for Rollins.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.671
She did this all on her own.

28:59.705 --> 29:00.873
I'm not stupid.
- Copy that.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.708
- And second of all,

29:02.809 --> 29:05.644
she hasn't said anything
about this to me.

29:05.677 --> 29:06.813
- She's really upset, I mean...
- Yeah?

29:06.846 --> 29:08.380
- She told me.
- Is she?

29:08.414 --> 29:10.116
You know why she did that,
Carisi?

29:10.149 --> 29:11.918
Because she figured
that you would tell me,

29:11.951 --> 29:13.352
so do me a favor,

29:13.385 --> 29:15.955
and tell her
I don't like triangles.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.693
- That's the defendant,
Mr. Panko,

29:21.727 --> 29:24.596
bringing another round of drinks
to Ms. Cryer and her friend.

29:24.630 --> 29:25.898
- How many rounds
did he serve them?

29:25.932 --> 29:27.733
- Five shots of expensive,
imported tequila

29:27.834 --> 29:29.135
in just over an hour.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.569
- And how much did she pay
for those drinks?

29:30.602 --> 29:32.038
- Nothing.

29:32.071 --> 29:33.672
We reviewed the club's
surveillance footage

29:33.705 --> 29:34.673
and the bar receipts.

29:34.706 --> 29:36.408
Ms. Cryer was never charged.

29:36.442 --> 29:37.443
- Thank you.

29:39.678 --> 29:42.949
- When Ms. Cryer first told
the police she had been raped,

29:42.982 --> 29:44.884
did you believe her?

29:44.917 --> 29:46.986
- Given her disclosure
and the hospital rape kit,

29:47.019 --> 29:48.420
we decided there was
enough evidence

29:48.454 --> 29:49.856
to pursue an investigation.

29:49.856 --> 29:53.125
- You investigated,
but then the D.A.'s office

29:53.159 --> 29:55.862
concluded there wasn't enough
evidence for an arrest.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.729
Isn't that right?
- Yes.

29:57.763 --> 30:00.032
- Is that because you had
caught Ms. Cryer in a lie?

30:00.066 --> 30:01.834
- She didn't lie.

30:01.868 --> 30:03.836
She initially omitted
Mr. D'Amico's involvement.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.171
- "Involvement."

30:05.204 --> 30:08.140
What she described
as consensual oral sex

30:08.174 --> 30:10.910
only after you spoke
to Bobby D'Amico

30:10.943 --> 30:13.179
and after you obtained video

30:13.212 --> 30:16.448
of her entering the bathroom
willingly with him.

30:16.482 --> 30:20.686
- Yes, but after a subsequent
conversation with Ms. Cryer,

30:20.719 --> 30:22.488
we expanded
the rape investigation

30:22.521 --> 30:24.556
to include Mr. D'Amico.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.025
- Was it a conversation,

30:26.058 --> 30:29.028
or did you find that out
from her vlog?

30:29.061 --> 30:30.129
- It was on her vlog,

30:30.162 --> 30:32.064
but she confirmed that story
to us.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.066
- So, to be clear,

30:34.100 --> 30:37.103
first, she said
she had been raped

30:37.136 --> 30:39.638
by Mr. Panko only.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.941
Then,
when confronted with video

30:41.974 --> 30:44.543
of her entering the bathroom
with Mr. D'Amico,

30:44.576 --> 30:47.479
she admitted
consensual oral sex.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.682
Then, when your D.A.
declined to press charges,

30:50.716 --> 30:52.318
she upped the stakes

30:52.351 --> 30:54.887
by saying she had been raped
by both Mr. Panko

30:54.921 --> 30:56.923
and Mr. D'Amico.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.425
Wait,
am I leaving anything out?

30:59.458 --> 31:01.660
- It's not unusual
for rape victims

31:01.693 --> 31:05.497
to initially omit details
or for their stories to change.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.833
- Twice?

31:07.934 --> 31:11.070
I can't wait to hear what story
she tells on the stand.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.504
- Objection, Your Honor.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.839
Please remind
the defense counsel

31:13.940 --> 31:16.108
that sarcasm is the weapon
of the weak.

31:16.142 --> 31:17.543
- That's enough, Mr. Barba...

31:17.576 --> 31:19.946
and Mr. Buchanan.

31:19.946 --> 31:22.648
The objection is sustained.
Jury will disregard.

31:24.850 --> 31:28.154
- Then he told me
that if I liked him,

31:28.187 --> 31:30.957
I needed to take care
of his friend too.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.592
I said no, but he forced me
to finish with him

31:33.625 --> 31:35.161
while Noel Panko watched.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.728
Then Bobby left,

31:36.762 --> 31:40.199
and while I was
splashing my face with water,

31:40.232 --> 31:42.501
Noel put a hand over my mouth

31:42.534 --> 31:45.071
and forced himself into me
from behind.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.772
- When you first reported this
to the police,

31:46.805 --> 31:49.841
you--you didn't mention
that Mr. D'Amico

31:49.875 --> 31:51.577
was part of the assault.

31:51.610 --> 31:52.844
Why not?

31:52.878 --> 31:54.580
- Because I went into that
bathroom with him.

31:54.613 --> 31:57.549
Because he was famous.

31:57.583 --> 31:58.985
Took time for me to understand

31:58.985 --> 32:01.220
that they were to blame
for what happened.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.754
Not me.

32:02.788 --> 32:04.823
- Thank you, Kristi.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.296
- Good morning, Ms. Cryer.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.798
So, you lied to the police

32:12.831 --> 32:14.866
because you thought
it was your fault.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.302
- Objection.
- Sustained.

32:16.335 --> 32:17.703
Do you have a question,
Mr. Buchanan?

32:17.736 --> 32:18.704
- Certainly, Your Honor.

32:18.737 --> 32:20.006
What is this, Ms. Cryer?

32:20.006 --> 32:21.607
- My website.

32:21.640 --> 32:25.777
- Yes. TownCryer,
hosted by YOLOvlogspot.com.

32:25.811 --> 32:27.713
What do you usually post there?

32:27.746 --> 32:28.847
- Videos.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.549
Pictures of my friends
and me going out.

32:30.582 --> 32:31.550
- Living the high life?

32:31.583 --> 32:32.551
- Objection.
Relevance.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.053
- Get to it, Mr. Buchanan.

32:34.086 --> 32:36.055
- Let's start
from when you all met.

32:36.088 --> 32:38.090
You removed this picture
from your site,

32:38.124 --> 32:40.726
but the Internet is forever,
isn't it?

32:40.759 --> 32:42.594
You look like
you're having fun.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.830
- I was...then.

32:44.863 --> 32:47.933
- And this one?
Were you having fun here?

32:49.201 --> 32:51.870
- I didn't know I was
about to be raped.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.839
- Moving on.

32:53.872 --> 32:56.842
- I was raped
in a nightclub bathroom.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.310
- Now, in this vlog,

32:58.344 --> 33:00.946
you didn't say Bobby D'Amico
had raped you, did you?

33:01.047 --> 33:02.214
- Objection.
Asked and answered.

33:02.248 --> 33:03.749
We've already established
that Ms. Cryer

33:03.782 --> 33:06.218
made inconsistent statements
to the police.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.854
- Your Honor, these vlog entries
aren't admitted for truth

33:08.887 --> 33:13.059
but as motive
for these inconsistencies.

33:13.059 --> 33:15.094
- I'll allow it.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.195
- Now, Ms. Cryer,

33:16.228 --> 33:19.731
what is this little number
under the video?

33:19.765 --> 33:21.867
- The number of times
it's been viewed.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.170
- 19,016.

33:24.203 --> 33:27.139
Before that, what was
your highest-viewed video?

33:27.173 --> 33:28.307
- About 800.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.942
- 704, actually.

33:30.976 --> 33:32.878
So, cry rape
and your numbers go up,

33:32.911 --> 33:34.280
is that how it works?
- That's not why I accused--

33:34.313 --> 33:36.282
- So after you made
this allegation,

33:36.315 --> 33:37.849
the police investigated,

33:37.883 --> 33:40.719
and the D.A. declined
to prosecute,

33:40.752 --> 33:43.789
which led to this video.

33:43.822 --> 33:46.825
- You all saw me in the ER,

33:46.858 --> 33:50.196
but I didn't tell
the whole story.

33:50.229 --> 33:52.098
I was gang-raped

33:52.098 --> 33:55.134
at Bobby D's by Noel Panko...

33:55.167 --> 33:58.104
and Bobby D'Amico.

33:58.137 --> 34:00.005
- How many views did that get?

34:00.106 --> 34:04.009
Oh, let's see.

34:04.110 --> 34:07.946
411,064.

34:07.979 --> 34:10.349
That's quite a jump.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.851
You get paid
by the click, don't you?

34:12.884 --> 34:15.887
- That's not why I accused him.
- It's not?

34:15.921 --> 34:17.723
Did the police ask you
to take it down

34:17.756 --> 34:19.891
while they conducted
their investigation?

34:19.925 --> 34:22.261
- Yes, but I--I wanted everyone
to know what he did to me.

34:22.294 --> 34:23.829
- Well, not at first.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.897
At first, you didn't even
tell the police

34:25.931 --> 34:27.766
you had made out
with Mr. D'Amico.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.535
You didn't tell them

34:29.568 --> 34:31.370
that you had gone
into the bathroom with him

34:31.403 --> 34:33.139
and happily performed
oral sex on him.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.506
- Objection.
Badgering the witness.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.575
Again, this has been asked
and answered.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.144
- Move it along, Mr. Buchanan.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.678
- I'm trying, but the jury

34:39.711 --> 34:42.748
has so many stories to sort out.

34:42.781 --> 34:45.751
Like this one.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.686
After your encounter,

34:47.719 --> 34:50.256
you went back upstairs,

34:50.289 --> 34:53.192
dancing and drinking
with your girlfriend.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.961
[dramatic music]

34:55.994 --> 34:57.229
[scoffs]

34:57.263 --> 34:58.430
I'm sorry.
Wait.

34:58.464 --> 35:01.167
This is not from your vlog.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.901
This is security footage
from the club.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.937
- I didn't want to upset
my friend.

35:05.971 --> 35:09.741
- So here,

35:09.775 --> 35:13.579
while you're dancing
and drinking,

35:13.612 --> 35:15.747
did you think
you had just been raped?

35:15.781 --> 35:19.185
Or did you think you had
another fun story for your vlog?

35:19.185 --> 35:20.652
- Objection.
Your Honor.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.654
- Withdrawn.

35:22.688 --> 35:25.691
So just to clarify,

35:25.724 --> 35:28.694
you were having fun upstairs.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.329
You were having fun

35:30.362 --> 35:32.431
in the hallway downstairs,

35:32.464 --> 35:33.732
and you were having fun

35:33.765 --> 35:36.402
on the dance floor afterwards.

35:36.435 --> 35:39.338
So the only time you claim

35:39.371 --> 35:40.939
you weren't having fun

35:40.972 --> 35:42.474
was in between.

35:42.508 --> 35:45.844
That ten-minute gap
when, conveniently,

35:45.877 --> 35:49.515
you stopped recording.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.350
And, regarding that gap,

35:51.383 --> 35:55.621
you've told three
very different stories.

35:55.654 --> 35:59.925
But I guess telling stories
is your art form, isn't it?

35:59.958 --> 36:01.360
*

36:01.393 --> 36:03.595
- [weeping]

36:03.629 --> 36:10.502
*

36:10.536 --> 36:11.537
[sobs]

36:20.279 --> 36:20.412
.

36:20.912 --> 36:21.380
- Yesterday was brutal.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.350
- She wanted her day in court.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.817
She looked them in the eye,
and then she got destroyed.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.553
- So you're going to bring her
back for a redirect?

36:27.586 --> 36:28.987
- I think the jury's seen
enough of her.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.490
- Look, the good news is
it's a he-said, she-said.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.558
- Uh-huh.
- Right?

36:32.591 --> 36:34.426
So they both have to
take the stand, testify,

36:34.460 --> 36:36.395
and tell their sleazy side
of the story.

36:36.428 --> 36:37.663
- And to know them
is to loathe them.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.365
I was up all night prepping.

36:39.398 --> 36:41.567
If I trick them
into opening the door,

36:41.600 --> 36:45.304
I'll get the judge to let me use
Rollins' video to impeach them.

36:45.337 --> 36:48.006
They don't know it yet,
but this is their last dance.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.812
- Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.481
Mr. Buchanan,

36:55.514 --> 36:58.417
I see here you have
two witnesses on your list?

36:58.450 --> 36:59.451
- I do, Your Honor.

36:59.485 --> 37:02.053
Mr. D'Amico and Mr. Panko.

37:02.087 --> 37:04.823
- Are you ready to call
Mr. Panko at this time?

37:04.856 --> 37:07.125
- Actually, I'm not.

37:07.158 --> 37:10.896
Given what we believe is
the prosecution's abject failure

37:10.929 --> 37:12.864
to make a coherent case--

37:12.898 --> 37:13.865
- Your--Your Honor--

37:13.899 --> 37:15.967
- And our many reasonable doubts

37:16.001 --> 37:18.770
about the alleged victim's
testimony,

37:18.804 --> 37:19.938
the defense has decided

37:19.971 --> 37:23.642
not to call any witnesses
at all.

37:23.675 --> 37:26.578
We feel comfortable leaving this
in the jury's hands.

37:26.612 --> 37:30.115
*

37:30.148 --> 37:31.617
- Hey, Counselor,
you got a second?

37:31.650 --> 37:32.618
- Not really.

37:32.651 --> 37:33.919
I've got 15 minutes

37:33.952 --> 37:35.321
before I have to face
a firing squad.

37:35.321 --> 37:36.922
- The honchos
coming down on you, huh?

37:36.955 --> 37:38.890
- Oh, they're past that.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.059
- Look, Kristi is a--
she's a horrible victim,

37:41.092 --> 37:42.728
but she's not lying.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.330
I mean, you saw what those guys
tried to do to Rollins.

37:44.330 --> 37:45.631
- They're going to get away
with that too.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.566
- Yeah, but it's worth
the fight.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.168
Listen, I, uh...

37:50.201 --> 37:53.939
I took the bar last weekend,
and I think I did okay.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.374
- Good for you.

37:55.407 --> 37:56.708
- And you've been pretty hard
on me,

37:56.742 --> 37:59.345
but I want you to know

37:59.345 --> 38:01.780
that if I did pass, a lot
of that's because of the time

38:01.813 --> 38:03.982
I spent working with you.

38:04.015 --> 38:04.983
I admire your, uh...

38:05.016 --> 38:06.352
- Suicidal streak?

38:06.352 --> 38:08.186
- Hey, guys...

38:08.219 --> 38:10.422
the jury's back?

38:10.456 --> 38:12.223
- What, already?
They just sat down.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.693
- I doubt they even sat.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.266
- You have a verdict?

38:21.367 --> 38:23.001
- We have, Your Honor.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.803
On the charges
of rape and sodomy

38:24.836 --> 38:26.372
in the first degree,

38:26.405 --> 38:30.376
we find the defendants,
Noel Panko and Bobby D'Amico,

38:30.376 --> 38:32.043
not guilty.

38:32.077 --> 38:37.215
*

38:37.248 --> 38:39.885
- Mr. D'Amico and Mr. Panko,

38:39.918 --> 38:42.087
you are free to go.

38:44.055 --> 38:47.493
The State of New York thanks
the jury for their service.

38:47.526 --> 38:48.560
[taps gavel]

38:48.594 --> 38:51.463
[somber music]

38:51.497 --> 38:59.405
*

38:59.405 --> 39:01.840
- I'm a national joke.

39:01.873 --> 39:05.276
Nobody's gonna believe me,
ever.

39:05.310 --> 39:06.277
- Hey, Kristi.

39:06.311 --> 39:08.113
Kristi.

39:08.146 --> 39:10.716
I know exactly
what those guys did to you.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.684
- Nobody else will.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.126
- No.

39:21.159 --> 39:24.095
I said no.
- "No" as in

39:24.129 --> 39:25.464
you know you want this?

39:25.497 --> 39:27.433
- Again, according
to anonymous sources,

39:27.466 --> 39:30.969
although D'Amico and Panko
were acquitted of all charges,

39:31.002 --> 39:34.205
the judge did not allow
the jury to see this video,

39:34.239 --> 39:36.808
which we have acquired
exclusively.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.309
The horrifying video

39:38.343 --> 39:42.180
that was taken by an undercover
SVU detective

39:42.213 --> 39:45.751
appears to show an assault
and attempted rape

39:45.784 --> 39:47.118
by the two defendants.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.455
The judge did not allow
the jury to see--

39:49.455 --> 39:50.922
- Ugh.
Talk about a Waterloo.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.057
There goes
his Netflix series.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.224
- You never know.

39:53.258 --> 39:55.226
- After this?
He's toast.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.062
- Rollins, my office,
please.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.936
- Liv, I swear to God,
I did not leak that video.

40:04.970 --> 40:07.072
- So I'm supposed
to believe you now?

40:07.105 --> 40:10.275
You went undercover
without informing me.

40:10.308 --> 40:12.844
This is another example of you
asking for forgiveness

40:12.878 --> 40:14.312
instead of permission.

40:14.345 --> 40:16.515
- But I--Liz, wait, wait.
I've--no, no, no.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.884
I'm not asking for forgiveness,
because I didn't do anything.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.118
- Please stop.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.153
- The defense,
the judge, Barba

40:22.187 --> 40:23.989
all had access
to that video.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.957
Literally dozens of people
could have turned it over.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.893
- We know the defense
didn't do it, Amanda,

40:27.926 --> 40:30.929
so I hope you're not seriously
suggesting that it was Barba.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.664
- Well, I just know
it wasn't me.

40:32.698 --> 40:33.999
- You know,

40:34.032 --> 40:37.302
I thought that things would
change after you had Jesse.

40:37.335 --> 40:40.371
I thought that you would think
before you acted.

40:40.405 --> 40:42.407
I was hoping to get past
my trust issues with you,

40:42.440 --> 40:43.408
and now this.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.143
- I swear on my baby girl

40:45.176 --> 40:47.112
that I did not do this.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.280
- You know there's gonna be
an investigation, don't you?

40:49.314 --> 40:51.550
They're gonna go through
your cell phone, your computer.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.051
- That's fine.
- Yeah, is it?

40:53.084 --> 40:55.687
Not to mention that Buchanan
is gonna bring on a lawsuit.

40:55.721 --> 40:57.022
- Really?

40:57.055 --> 40:58.524
You think D'Amico's gonna
want to sue

40:58.557 --> 41:01.192
over a video that shows him
trying to rape me?

41:01.226 --> 41:02.193
[knocking at door]

41:02.227 --> 41:03.829
- Am I interrupting?

41:03.862 --> 41:05.296
- Yeah.
- No.

41:05.330 --> 41:07.599
Rollins and I are done.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.541
- She just stood there,
and she lied to my face.

41:15.574 --> 41:17.342
And I don't know what
to tell your father,

41:17.375 --> 41:20.912
because she swears that she
didn't leak the video.

41:20.946 --> 41:22.548
- I believe her.

41:22.581 --> 41:25.951
- Why?

41:25.984 --> 41:28.687
- Because I know who did.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.825
Don't worry.
It can't be traced.

41:40.331 --> 41:44.302
- What are you telling me?

41:44.335 --> 41:47.138
- I don't want to put you
between me and my father,

41:47.172 --> 41:50.308
so you might want to stop
asking questions.

41:58.316 --> 42:00.451
- Okay.

42:00.485 --> 42:03.088
- Bobby D'Amico
got what he deserved.

42:07.458 --> 42:10.228
Told you
I never liked the guy.

42:10.261 --> 42:17.168
*
