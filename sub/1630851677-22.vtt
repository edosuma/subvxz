No, no, I'm good

09:52.417 --> 09:53.331
on the mental image,

09:53.505 --> 09:54.158
but thank you for coming.

09:54.332 --> 09:56.073
Da.

09:56.247 --> 09:59.860
And I brought some nastoyka
for a celebratory drink.

09:59.990 --> 10:01.165
Well, that's about par
for the course.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.254
And, Callen,

10:03.428 --> 10:04.647
I am glad you're okay also.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.431
It is obvious

10:06.562 --> 10:09.173
how much my Anna loves you,
and I also...

10:09.347 --> 10:12.176
Well... Well, I, uh...

10:12.350 --> 10:13.874
I like you, too, Arkady.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.832
Ah. [laughs]

10:17.617 --> 10:18.922
Let us drink to that.

10:19.096 --> 10:20.837
Nastoyka for everyone.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.154
Good morning, team.
What do we got?

10:33.284 --> 10:34.721
Morning.

10:34.895 --> 10:37.071
What we got is a heist crew

10:37.245 --> 10:39.595
with a whole lot of
military-grade firepower.

10:39.769 --> 10:42.467
Wow, just once, I wish bad guys
came correct with airsoft guns.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.817
[scoffs]I wish that, too,

10:43.947 --> 10:45.296
but that day is not today.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.342
Okay.LAPD CSU found

10:47.516 --> 10:52.042
dozens of spent 7.62
NATO shell casings.

10:52.216 --> 10:55.045
There was a Vietnam Army vet
playing poker at the casino.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.178
He told the LAPD that
he swears what he heard

10:57.352 --> 10:58.309
was an M60.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.050
An M60?

11:00.181 --> 11:01.486
Robbing a casino in L.A.?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.706
And that's not all.
This car...

11:03.880 --> 11:04.838
was blown up
by a grenade.

11:04.968 --> 11:06.709
How do we know it was a grenade?

11:06.840 --> 11:08.537
Bomb squad found an undetonated
one next to the car.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.800
DEEKS:
Why are they trying
to blow up a car?

11:10.974 --> 11:11.932
It seems like
the guards were near it.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.760
They were probably open-firing
on the UTV.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.587
That's not good. What's
the condition of the guards?

11:15.762 --> 11:16.937
They are sedated and recovering

11:17.111 --> 11:18.460
in a hospital.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.375
Case landed here
to make sure

11:20.549 --> 11:22.856
the munition wasn't
stolen military property.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.423
So, you would have shown us
surveillance footage, but...

11:25.554 --> 11:27.164
There isn't any.

11:27.338 --> 11:28.557
The machine gun shot out
all the cameras.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.559
DEEKS:
Wow, precision shooting

11:30.733 --> 11:32.387
with a gun that big,
that's a smooth operator.

11:32.561 --> 11:33.693
ROUNTREE:
But we do have a witness.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.346
Casino employee.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.914
Was leaving work
at the time.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.568
Kilbride sent Callen and Sam
over to talk to her.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.222
And he wants to see the two
of you in his office.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.006
Oh.Oh. Maybe he just wants a hug.

11:44.747 --> 11:45.748
I'll give you a hug.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.359
[knocking]In.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.361
Good morning, sir.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.581
Nothing good about mornings
in L.A.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.888
Okay.40 minutes to drive ten miles.

11:55.062 --> 11:57.194
But at least
everyone's still got time

11:57.368 --> 11:59.893
for their mindfulness practice.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.851
Well, I know it takes effort,
but it's important

12:02.025 --> 12:04.027
to schedule time every day
to check in with yourself.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.115
We could do
some trust falls.

12:07.596 --> 12:08.989
Sorry, I thought we were at
the place in our relationship

12:09.163 --> 12:11.121
where we could banter,
but evidently I, uh...

12:11.295 --> 12:12.514
You what?

12:12.688 --> 12:14.342
I miscalculated that.

12:14.472 --> 12:15.778
You wanted to see us, sir.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.824
Yeah.

12:17.998 --> 12:20.565
So, you heard that
whoever took down

12:20.696 --> 12:24.004
that armored truck
used an M60 and grenades.

12:24.134 --> 12:27.094
Now, not only is that
some serious firepower

12:27.268 --> 12:29.618
to be rolling around the streets
of Los Angeles, but...

12:29.792 --> 12:30.750
More like crawling
through traffic. [laughs]

12:32.534 --> 12:33.753
Was a callback.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.450
Sorry.

12:35.624 --> 12:36.581
It's like acid reflex.
I just can't stop it.

12:36.756 --> 12:37.931
Reflux.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.195
As I was about to say...

12:42.979 --> 12:44.633
Weapons and munitions
like that

12:44.807 --> 12:47.462
can't just be purchased
by a civilian,

12:47.636 --> 12:49.856
so they must've been
acquired illegally.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.162
Well, the heist crew may
even be backed

12:52.293 --> 12:54.643
by some high-profile
arms dealer.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.384
That's where my head went also,

12:56.514 --> 12:59.648
but weapons like this are not
necessarily illegal

12:59.822 --> 13:00.649
for certain people

13:00.823 --> 13:02.956
to possess;
it could be

13:03.086 --> 13:04.131
an above-boards arms dealer
or...

13:05.828 --> 13:07.656
...a criminal one.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.005
KENSI:
Tough-looking lady.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.007
KILBRIDE: Understatement.
Her name is Nina Barnes.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.488
She is one of
the most connected arms dealers

13:13.662 --> 13:14.445
in the Western United States.

13:14.619 --> 13:17.361
At least she used to be.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.276
She is now either

13:19.450 --> 13:22.236
out of the business
or handling it on the down-low.

13:22.410 --> 13:23.715
So, this Nina Barnes,
is she one of

13:23.890 --> 13:24.760
those above-the-board
arms dealers,

13:24.891 --> 13:26.501
or is she one of
the criminal ones?

13:26.675 --> 13:28.590
Well, I would say,
over the last couple of decades,

13:28.764 --> 13:30.635
she's about 70/30.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.463
70% legal.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.683
A few years back,
she became

13:34.857 --> 13:36.946
entangled in a sting operation

13:37.120 --> 13:39.862
that targeted stolen
Navy weapons and ordnance.

13:40.036 --> 13:40.994
And?

13:41.124 --> 13:44.127
And she became untangled,

13:44.301 --> 13:46.129
and so,
now she owes me one.

13:46.303 --> 13:47.609
A big one.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.916
Nina's now in Los Angeles.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.614
Find out where she is
and what she knows.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.007
Done.Got it.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.184
That's-- Offer still stands
on those trust falls.

14:00.665 --> 14:01.710
[door closes]

14:04.582 --> 14:05.409
CASTOR:
Hey, guys.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.716
This is Amanda Chen.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.152
CALLEN:
Thanks, Castor.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.285
Amanda, please have a seat.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.982
Thanks for coming in
to speak with us.

14:15.376 --> 14:16.551
I got to be honest,
this place has got a touch of

14:16.725 --> 14:18.292
that serial killer vibe.

14:18.466 --> 14:19.946
A little weird.

14:20.120 --> 14:20.947
We'll take that
into consideration

14:21.121 --> 14:23.123
when we redecorate,
all right?

14:23.253 --> 14:25.038
[chuckles softly]Can you tell us what
you saw this morning?

14:25.168 --> 14:26.474
We weren't able to get
any surveillance footage.

14:26.604 --> 14:27.823
The Shooters took out
the cameras.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.129
There weren't any shooters
there.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.391
It was that thing...

14:30.521 --> 14:32.480
It was like...

14:32.610 --> 14:35.483
some kind of souped-up
armored golf cart.

14:35.613 --> 14:36.963
And no one was driving it?

14:37.137 --> 14:38.790
No, it was remote-controlled
or something.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.315
Like a drone, or...I guess.

14:41.489 --> 14:43.795
It was just like one of
those remote-controlled toys

14:43.970 --> 14:45.536
my brother used to have
as a kid,

14:45.710 --> 14:47.364
just the life-sized version.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.976
And it fired a large-caliber
automatic weapon?

14:50.150 --> 14:51.891
Yeah, a big machine gun.

14:52.065 --> 14:53.893
And what was weird was that

14:54.067 --> 14:55.329
it spoke

14:55.503 --> 14:57.026
with this robotic voice.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.072
It told the guards
to bring it the money.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.509
So, what did it do
after it got the money?

15:01.683 --> 15:05.469
There was this explosion.

15:05.643 --> 15:08.081
As I was running away, I saw it
take off south down Vermont.

15:09.604 --> 15:10.692
That's good information.

15:10.866 --> 15:13.521
Thank you, Amanda.

15:13.651 --> 15:15.001
Okay, we know the UTV drone
left the casino property

15:15.175 --> 15:18.265
heading south on Vermont,

15:18.439 --> 15:19.788
but I'm not seeing it on
any of the traffic cams

15:19.962 --> 15:21.050
in the surrounding areas.

15:21.224 --> 15:23.444
Hmm.

15:23.618 --> 15:26.360
Oh, what if it pulled
a full-on Knight Rider?

15:26.534 --> 15:28.318
I don't know
what those words mean.

15:28.449 --> 15:29.798
When I was a kid,

15:29.972 --> 15:31.365
my neighbor used to watch
this old show.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.280
It had a talking car
and the guy from Baywatchin it.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.543
Anyways,

15:35.673 --> 15:37.588
the talking car would pull up
and into this semitruck

15:37.762 --> 15:38.502
and move around the country

15:38.676 --> 15:41.114
undetected.Whoa.

15:41.244 --> 15:43.333
Okay, what if we reset

15:43.464 --> 15:45.205
the search criteria
to look for trucks

15:45.335 --> 15:46.684
that are big enough
to transport the UTV.

15:48.556 --> 15:49.992
[groans] Gosh.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.863
The casino's in
a commercial zone.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.344
Look at all the trucks
it could've been transported in.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.129
ROUNDTREE:
If that thing is
moving around the city,

15:56.303 --> 15:58.261
with that much firepower
completely undetected...

15:58.435 --> 15:59.871
FATIMA:
Everything's a potential target.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.395
Jewelry stores,
art galleries, banks...

16:01.569 --> 16:03.136
Or worse,

16:03.310 --> 16:04.572
could go after crowds
and soft targets.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.574
LAPD would have no way
of stopping that thing

16:06.748 --> 16:07.705
if it started firing.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.240
We checked all
the rental trucks

16:20.370 --> 16:21.284
around the casino
at the time of the robbery,

16:21.458 --> 16:22.242
and there's nothing
out of the ordinary

16:22.416 --> 16:23.678
about the renters.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.506
I mean, no criminal history,
nothing.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.899
And I'm looking into
the privately owned trucks,

16:28.074 --> 16:29.901
but there are a lot
and most of them are

16:30.076 --> 16:31.425
owned through corporations,

16:31.599 --> 16:32.817
so it's slow going.

16:32.948 --> 16:33.862
Got it. Keep us posted.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.603
Will do.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.648
Uh, this drone UTV,

16:37.822 --> 16:40.303
it's big
and it's loaded with weaponry.

16:40.477 --> 16:42.653
Now, whoever's behind this,
they're not gonna take chances

16:42.827 --> 16:44.699
transporting it around.

16:44.873 --> 16:47.267
Yeah, why risk stealing a truck
or even renting one.

16:47.441 --> 16:48.311
Yeah. They hire a pro.

16:48.485 --> 16:49.704
Somebody who specializes

16:49.878 --> 16:51.271
in moving illegal things
around the city.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.447
We know someone
that lives in that world.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.798
Yes, we do.Mm-hmm.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.716
Okay, this cannot be
the address.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.326
"Premium cake decorating"?

17:03.500 --> 17:05.328
Um, yes, please.

17:05.459 --> 17:06.634
Shall we?

17:06.764 --> 17:07.330
Fondant is your friend.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.289
It's your...

17:09.419 --> 17:10.551
concealer,
it's your backspace button.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.422
Your cake is lacking

17:12.553 --> 17:14.337
a little symmetry-- fondant.

17:14.511 --> 17:17.297
You've make a mistake
with your frosting--

17:17.471 --> 17:18.776
fondant.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.649
Your middle cake layer
is supposed to be

17:21.779 --> 17:23.042
a six-inch circle,

17:23.216 --> 17:25.696
but it's more
like a five-inch oval--

17:25.870 --> 17:27.872
say it with me.

17:28.003 --> 17:29.265
Fondant.GROUP: Fondant!

17:29.439 --> 17:31.528
NINA:
Oh, hi.

17:31.659 --> 17:33.704
You must be Colby and Deana.
I saved your place right here.

17:33.878 --> 17:35.228
Station four.Fantastic.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.143
Uh, actually, we are not
Colby and Deana.

17:37.317 --> 17:39.884
Oh, uh, do you pronounce it
"Dean-a"?

17:40.015 --> 17:41.321
I'm sorry,
honest mistake.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.497
Not a microaggression.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.281
We're federal agents, and
we'd like to speak with you.

17:47.544 --> 17:50.504
Uh, well, I would love to
help out law enforcement,

17:50.678 --> 17:51.853
any way I can,

17:52.027 --> 17:54.464
but I have a paying class here,

17:54.595 --> 17:57.163
so maybe you could come back
this afternoon.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.817
Admiral Kilbride said you'd
be available to us right now.

18:01.515 --> 18:02.820
[chuckles]

18:02.951 --> 18:04.300
[stammers]

18:04.474 --> 18:06.085
Fondant.

18:07.390 --> 18:08.478
How crazy is it
that someone used

18:08.609 --> 18:09.958
a drone vehicle

18:10.132 --> 18:12.003
to rob a casino.

18:12.178 --> 18:15.703
♪ It's a whole new world! ♪

18:15.833 --> 18:17.357
[chuckles] Okay.[sighs]

18:17.531 --> 18:19.272
All right,
this is what I'm talking about.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.100
That is what needs to be
in your dating profile.

18:21.274 --> 18:22.666
Yeah. My singing?No.

18:22.840 --> 18:23.885
You can't sing.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.800
I'm talking about your love

18:25.974 --> 18:29.499
and deep, deep knowledge
of Disney musicals.

18:29.673 --> 18:31.022
[chuckles] Yeah, I have logged
hundreds of hours

18:31.197 --> 18:32.415
watching those
with my little sis.

18:32.589 --> 18:33.982
You can't go wrong
with Aladdin

18:34.156 --> 18:35.331
and Beauty and the Beast.

18:35.505 --> 18:36.941
Yeah, but Raya
and the Last Dragon,

18:37.072 --> 18:39.248
that is literally fire.

18:39.422 --> 18:40.336
[chuckles] See what
I did there? Fire.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.338
[typing]

18:44.601 --> 18:46.821
Ooh, Admiral.

18:46.995 --> 18:48.997
I'm glad that you can
still carve out time

18:49.171 --> 18:50.433
to watch cartoons.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.305
Don't really watch them anymore.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.220
I just kind of...
Well, actually, I...

18:54.394 --> 18:55.873
Sitrep.

18:56.047 --> 18:56.874
Kensi and Deeks
were able to locate

18:57.005 --> 18:59.442
your contact, Nina Barnes,

18:59.616 --> 19:01.314
and Sam and Callen are
hitting up some street contacts

19:01.444 --> 19:03.229
to see if anyone's heard
about the drone UTVs.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.231
Copy that.

19:06.884 --> 19:09.322
And, Rountree.

19:09.452 --> 19:10.366
Yes, sir.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.588
How could you not mention Moana?

19:16.242 --> 19:17.765
[chuckles]:
Y-Yeah.

19:20.898 --> 19:23.162
That tells me a lot about
the kind of person you are.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.474
What? He's right.
Moana'sbomb.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.607
Ah... [scoffs]

19:33.781 --> 19:36.653
I am very sorry.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.525
Obviously, your next class is
gonna be on the house.

19:38.699 --> 19:41.005
Oh, gosh.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.008
[sighs] All right.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.097
How's that old bastard Kilbride?

19:46.272 --> 19:48.230
Pretty sure
he hates living in L.A.,

19:48.361 --> 19:50.058
but other than that,
he's, um, doing fine.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.799
Kilbride is living in L.A.?

19:51.973 --> 19:53.714
Yes, he is.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.455
Oh, he must be miserable.

19:55.629 --> 19:56.804
I love it.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.633
Ha. Karma's such a nasty bitch.

19:59.807 --> 20:00.721
Isn't it, though?

20:00.851 --> 20:01.983
[Nina chuckles]

20:02.157 --> 20:03.854
So, what's the weapon?

20:04.028 --> 20:05.595
Excuse me?Well, he sent you here.

20:05.726 --> 20:06.814
Obviously, he wants to know
how some illegal weapon

20:06.944 --> 20:08.119
got into L.A.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.860
DEEKS:
Uh, right, unmanned UTV

20:10.034 --> 20:12.733
firing 7.62 NATO rounds
and a grenade launcher.

20:12.907 --> 20:15.214
Wow, that's
a serious piece of equipment.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.346
Those rounds are fired

20:17.520 --> 20:21.524
from a Mark 43 Mod 0.
The SEALs use that machine gun.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.047
Yeah, we're checking to see
if any were stolen,

20:23.178 --> 20:25.006
but a Vietnam veteran
heard the gunfire.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.660
He swears it was an M60.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.749
M60, that would work, too.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.838
Yeah.So, a remote-operated M60.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.623
That's hard to get your hands
on, but it's not impossible.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.669
On the other hand,
a grenade launcher,

20:35.843 --> 20:37.497
that's a little harder
to come by in L.A.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.629
And that's why we're here.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.849
Yeah. Well, I'm intrigued.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.764
If these weapons are here in
L.A. and I didn't bring them in,

20:43.938 --> 20:45.026
then I want to find out who did
just as bad as you.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.680
DEEKS:So...

20:46.854 --> 20:48.421
you're gonna help us do that?

20:48.595 --> 20:50.945
Yep. All right,
I'm gonna need a clean machine

20:51.119 --> 20:52.990
running Kali Linux and Tor
to access the dark web,

20:53.121 --> 20:54.818
an untraceable cell phone,

20:54.992 --> 20:56.124
and a place to work.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.517
I don't do guns
in my cake store.

20:57.691 --> 20:58.866
Got it.

20:59.040 --> 20:59.910
After you.

21:05.176 --> 21:06.613
[dog barking in distance]

21:14.273 --> 21:15.752
You lost, man?

21:15.926 --> 21:17.667
No, I'm just taking in
the sights of Koreatown.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.278
Say, where do you get
the best kalbi around here?

21:19.452 --> 21:21.976
I don't know who you are,

21:22.106 --> 21:23.673
but you need to move on or
something will happen to you...

21:23.804 --> 21:25.196
Something like what?

21:25.371 --> 21:26.850
We don't have time for this.
I'll take this.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.159
Damn you, Switch.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.552
Yeah, Switch.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.215
SANG:
Look, I don't know anything

21:44.390 --> 21:46.000
about some remote-
controlled UTV.

21:46.174 --> 21:47.915
No one came to me
to move it around the city.

21:48.045 --> 21:49.133
And, you know what, Switch?
Screw you.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.831
You stole from us.

21:51.005 --> 21:52.485
Look at it as more of
a redistribution plan

21:52.615 --> 21:54.138
instead of stealing.
Know what I mean?

21:54.269 --> 21:55.879
I used to like you, Switch.
You suck now!

21:56.053 --> 21:57.316
Yeah, I'm heartbroken.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.492
Okay. So,
if you didn't transport the UTV,

21:59.622 --> 22:00.362
who'd they go to?

22:00.536 --> 22:02.451
Who's this guy?

22:02.625 --> 22:04.148
You make so much coin now,
you travel with your accountant?

22:04.279 --> 22:06.412
I'm Mr. Carl.
I'm his life coach.

22:06.586 --> 22:07.717
His what the hell?

22:07.848 --> 22:09.110
SAM:
I need that utility vehicle,

22:09.284 --> 22:10.285
and you're gonna
help us find out

22:10.416 --> 22:11.373
how they rolling
around the city.

22:11.547 --> 22:12.766
If you were hanging

22:12.940 --> 22:13.593
off the side of a building,

22:13.767 --> 22:14.942
I wouldn't help you.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.988
Hmm.Normandie, Catalina, 6th Street.

22:18.162 --> 22:20.774
What's that?Streets you have garages on.

22:20.948 --> 22:21.992
It's probably where you'd stash

22:22.166 --> 22:22.906
your clients' merch, right?

22:23.080 --> 22:24.865
You help us now,

22:25.039 --> 22:25.779
or we tax them all today.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.305
[sucks teeth]

22:30.479 --> 22:31.872
They'd be moving it
in a 14-foot truck

22:32.046 --> 22:33.177
with dummy out-of-state plates.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.875
I'll give you a name,

22:35.049 --> 22:36.442
then we're good.No, no, no.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.182
I'm on a clock, all right?

22:38.313 --> 22:39.706
You're gonna take us
to the name, right now.

22:42.012 --> 22:43.753
[speaking German]

22:48.802 --> 22:50.194
[line beeps]

22:51.805 --> 22:53.546
[speaking Chinese]

22:56.897 --> 22:59.203
She's absolutely no joke.

22:59.334 --> 23:00.553
Yeah, as long as
she's not calling

23:00.683 --> 23:02.206
for a nuclear airstrike
on the boatshed.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.599
No, that'd be a bummer.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.688
Okay.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.995
The right people are on it.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.126
Pretty soon,
we'll know who brought

23:09.300 --> 23:10.389
that grenade launcher into L.A.

23:10.563 --> 23:11.955
All right.

23:19.659 --> 23:21.661
My man Pelican's spot is right
up there, behind that fence.

23:21.835 --> 23:22.923
Why do they call him Pelican?

23:23.097 --> 23:24.141
How should I know, man?

23:32.585 --> 23:34.151
What'd he say?

23:34.325 --> 23:35.022
I think he wants
to hire you to be

23:35.152 --> 23:36.023
his personal life coach.

23:36.153 --> 23:38.417
Oh, good,
he could use it.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.941
Yo, Pelican. It's me.

23:41.115 --> 23:42.159
Got a couple friends with me.

23:43.639 --> 23:44.771
PELICAN [over speaker]:
Just you.

23:46.294 --> 23:47.817
Okay. Go.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.041
[gate closes]

24:00.134 --> 24:03.050
Anna's still a little shaken up
from that whole Katya ordeal.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.312
Well, most people would be.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.836
But now that Katya's gone,

24:07.010 --> 24:08.621
you two don't have to look
over your shoulder anymore.

24:10.971 --> 24:12.755
It still doesn't explain
where Pembrook is or why.

24:12.929 --> 24:14.191
Don't do that.

24:14.322 --> 24:15.758
What?

24:15.932 --> 24:17.194
Come on, man,
you know how you get.

24:17.325 --> 24:18.979
Things start going good.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.937
You start focusing on
the next thing

24:21.111 --> 24:23.157
and push people away.Oh.

24:23.331 --> 24:24.114
You're taking a
creative writing course

24:24.288 --> 24:25.551
on Masterclass again?

24:25.725 --> 24:27.466
Anna's good for you, G.

24:27.640 --> 24:28.815
I know she is.

24:28.989 --> 24:29.816
[gate opens]

24:34.951 --> 24:36.257
Man, you owe me, Switch.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.302
Pelican didn't want to talk,

24:38.433 --> 24:39.347
and I was like,
"You know who I am?

24:39.521 --> 24:40.653
"You know the business I do?

24:40.783 --> 24:42.176
I could cut you out of
every deal in this town."

24:42.350 --> 24:44.744
Who rented his truck
to transport the UTV?

24:44.918 --> 24:46.789
Guy's name is Lou Faria.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.269
Nice work.

24:48.443 --> 24:49.705
That's not all.

24:49.879 --> 24:52.012
Pelican tracks
all of his vehicles.

24:52.186 --> 24:52.926
Gave me the transponder.

24:54.231 --> 24:56.146
Oh.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.713
You the man, Sang.[scoffs]

24:57.887 --> 24:59.541
[sighs]

24:59.715 --> 25:01.325
Nah, nah, nah.We good.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.892
You can bounce.

25:03.023 --> 25:04.111
[scoffs] Funny.
Take me back to my place.

25:04.241 --> 25:05.242
You see me smiling?

25:05.373 --> 25:06.940
Oh, come on, Switch.

25:07.114 --> 25:08.376
What am I supposed to do
way out here?

25:08.550 --> 25:09.508
Sounds like a you problem.

25:09.682 --> 25:11.248
Screw you, Switch.

25:11.379 --> 25:12.511
[engine starts]

25:12.685 --> 25:14.904
CALLEN:
Hey.

25:15.078 --> 25:17.341
If you need a life coach,
Switch knows how to reach me.

25:20.127 --> 25:21.520
[vehicle departs]

25:23.696 --> 25:24.523
We're tapped into
the transponder,

25:24.697 --> 25:26.002
but there's no signal yet.

25:26.176 --> 25:27.308
It may only work
when the truck is on

25:27.482 --> 25:28.396
and in motion.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.354
Copy that.

25:30.485 --> 25:31.530
FATIMA: Okay, so, this guy
that rented the truck,

25:31.704 --> 25:33.532
Lou Faria, he's been
in and out of the system

25:33.706 --> 25:35.534
since he was 18.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.405
And it looks like variety is

25:37.579 --> 25:40.234
the spice of life for this guy
because he's been in

25:40.408 --> 25:42.932
for assault, armed robbery,
theft and drunk driving.

25:43.063 --> 25:44.543
Fits the bill
for the casino robbery,

25:44.717 --> 25:46.283
but he's more of
a strong-arm guy.

25:46.457 --> 25:48.155
Nothing here says he'd
even be capable of

25:48.285 --> 25:50.636
operating a drone,
let alone build it.

25:50.810 --> 25:51.811
All right, let us know
when you get any movements

25:51.985 --> 25:52.986
on the transponder.

25:53.160 --> 25:53.682
FATIMA:
You know it.

25:58.382 --> 26:01.429
NINA:
Who put up all these photos
of Doc Paskowitz's family?

26:01.603 --> 26:04.171
Uh, the lady
that set this place up.Hmm.

26:04.301 --> 26:06.826
KENSI:Looks like he had
quite the life, doesn't it?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.915
Mm. For sure.

26:09.089 --> 26:09.916
You got kids?

26:11.221 --> 26:13.659
Uh, do we?

26:14.660 --> 26:16.096
This morning, we did not,

26:16.226 --> 26:17.837
but by tonight we--

26:18.011 --> 26:19.621
oh, my God-- we will.Thank you.

26:19.795 --> 26:22.058
[gasps] Uh...

26:22.232 --> 26:23.320
You two are a couple?

26:23.451 --> 26:24.974
Oh. Yeah.Yeah.

26:25.105 --> 26:26.497
[chuckles]

26:26.672 --> 26:27.847
What's so funny?Uh, nothing.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.979
Just, you know,

26:30.110 --> 26:31.677
you're punching a little
above your weight with her.

26:31.851 --> 26:33.548
Psh. Don't I know it.Thank you.

26:33.679 --> 26:34.897
[laughs]We were just, uh,

26:35.071 --> 26:37.900
approved to foster
a child, so...

26:38.074 --> 26:39.206
it's a pretty big day.Oh, well,

26:39.336 --> 26:40.424
congratulations.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.036
Thanks, it's amazing,

26:43.210 --> 26:45.952
but we assumed we'd have
a little more time to set up.

26:46.126 --> 26:46.996
More than seven hours.A little more than seven hours.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.215
[phone rings]Oh. Yeah?

26:49.564 --> 26:51.261
[speaking German]

26:53.829 --> 26:56.571
Elias, you know I'm in L.A.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.268
I need to be made aware
when deals like this

26:58.442 --> 26:59.139
are happening here.

26:59.269 --> 27:00.923
Yeah. Thank you.

27:01.097 --> 27:02.490
Just make sure
it doesn't happen again.

27:02.664 --> 27:03.796
What were the deal terms?

27:05.885 --> 27:07.060
I'll be in touch.

27:08.757 --> 27:11.281
So, it was
a Milkor Y2 grenade launcher,

27:11.455 --> 27:13.327
and it was brought
into the country by the Germans.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.068
And they sold it to...?Well, that's the thing.

27:15.242 --> 27:16.504
It wasn't sold,
the buyer traded it

27:16.678 --> 27:18.680
for an unarmed UTV drone.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.900
Oh, nice, I'm sure
a high-level arms dealer

27:21.030 --> 27:22.945
will have no problem figuring
