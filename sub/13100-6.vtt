00:01.833 --> 00:04.417
[instrumental music]

00:04.500 --> 00:05.833
Look, I'm not
taking this down.

00:05.917 --> 00:07.500
You want me to report this?
Is that what you want?

00:07.583 --> 00:10.125
- Because I can do that.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

00:10.208 --> 00:12.125
Ah, captain, good.

00:12.208 --> 00:13.750
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

00:13.833 --> 00:14.917
It's alright, it's alright.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.375
I heard there was a problem.

00:16.458 --> 00:19.292
Yeah, this thug, this momser,
came into my shop

00:19.375 --> 00:20.958
and started telling me
what to do.

00:21.042 --> 00:23.250
He broke the rules, captain.
What am I supposed to do?

00:23.333 --> 00:25.708
- What rules?
- Well, you saw the news.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.042
'Clark helped assassinate
Santiago.'

00:28.125 --> 00:30.375
'People want to express their
feelings about it.'

00:35.500 --> 00:36.917
- That's all?
- It's sedition.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.542
- Disloyalty--
- It's an opinion.

00:38.625 --> 00:40.792
The senate hearings back home
will decide if it's true or not.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.250
It's an attack
on the presidency.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.917
- The Ministry of Peace-
- Isn't here.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.708
And this isn't disloyalty
or an attack

00:46.792 --> 00:48.417
on the office of the president.

00:48.500 --> 00:49.958
There's a difference
between the position

00:50.042 --> 00:52.958
and the person who's occupying
it at the moment.

00:53.042 --> 00:54.375
'Sir, go on back to your shop.'

00:54.458 --> 00:56.542
If this happens again,
you call me.

00:56.625 --> 00:58.042
Thank you, captain.

00:58.125 --> 01:00.625
Aren't you late for a Bund
meeting or something?

01:04.042 --> 01:07.292
This is the fourth incident
like this I've had in two days.

01:07.375 --> 01:08.792
Enough.

01:08.875 --> 01:11.292
If it happens again, whoever's
responsible will be disciplined.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.500
- Is that clear?
- I was just following orders--

01:13.583 --> 01:15.667
I said, is that clear?

01:17.125 --> 01:18.417
Yes, sir.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.833
I got your page. What's up?

01:27.917 --> 01:30.083
I got your favorite person
in the whole universe

01:30.167 --> 01:31.542
hanging on Gold Channel 3.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.167
'Figured you'd wanna
see this yourself.'

01:34.250 --> 01:35.833
Open channel.

01:35.917 --> 01:37.750
Ah, sorry for the delay,
Mr. Bester.

01:37.833 --> 01:39.917
But I figured I'd better have
a superior officer here.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.292
- Won't you go ahead?
- Commander.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.500
I was just telling
Mr. Garibaldi here

01:44.583 --> 01:49.458
that I'll be arriving on Babylon
5 in approximately seven hours.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.958
I'm in pursuit of an individual
who's a danger to your station

01:53.042 --> 01:55.292
Earth and the Psi Corps.

01:55.375 --> 01:59.000
Well, that's two legitimate
things to worry about.

01:59.083 --> 02:02.500
Please have everyone ready
for a briefing upon my arrival.

02:02.583 --> 02:05.000
I'll see you then.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.750
Every time he comes here,
it's the same old gag..

02:07.833 --> 02:09.708
...somebody here is a danger
to the station

02:09.792 --> 02:12.708
planetary security, whatever.

02:12.792 --> 02:15.708
Ah, it's just a cover story
so they can run a number on us.

02:15.792 --> 02:16.875
They never learn.

02:16.958 --> 02:18.208
I mean, does he really
think that

02:18.292 --> 02:19.792
we're gonna fall
for that line again?

02:19.875 --> 02:21.917
[screaming]

02:24.000 --> 02:26.708
The mountain's falling on me!

02:26.792 --> 02:28.667
The mountain's falling!

02:28.750 --> 02:30.375
[screaming]

02:30.458 --> 02:34.500
Make it stop! I can't take it,
I can't take it!

02:34.583 --> 02:36.583
Make it stop, damn it!

02:37.875 --> 02:40.708
[grunting]

02:40.792 --> 02:43.750
Make it stop! Make it stop!

02:43.833 --> 02:47.750
Make it stop! Make it stop!

02:47.833 --> 02:49.542
Stop!

02:52.000 --> 02:56.708
(Susan)
The Babylon Project was our
last, best hope for peace.

03:00.292 --> 03:02.083
It failed.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.042
[intense music]

03:16.375 --> 03:18.083
But in the year
of the Shadow War

03:18.167 --> 03:20.583
it became something greater

03:20.667 --> 03:23.917
our last,
best hope for victory.

03:24.833 --> 03:27.625
[theme music]

03:29.125 --> 03:31.292
The year is 2260.

03:31.375 --> 03:34.417
The place, Babylon 5.

03:37.333 --> 03:40.375
[music continues]

04:19.833 --> 04:21.500
[instrumental music]

04:23.333 --> 04:27.208
We've got a major problem
on our hands, people.

04:27.292 --> 04:28.875
In a little more than five hours

04:28.958 --> 04:31.500
Bester will be arriving
in Bay 9.

04:31.583 --> 04:35.000
Bester? I do not believe
I have had the pleasure.

04:35.083 --> 04:36.292
He's a Psi Cop.

04:36.375 --> 04:39.125
They're an elite corps
of telepaths rated P-12

04:39.208 --> 04:40.417
the strongest we've got.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.875
Not that we know about.

04:41.958 --> 04:44.458
In theory, they chase
down rogue telepaths.

04:44.542 --> 04:46.042
But in Bester's case,
that mandate

04:46.125 --> 04:47.833
is just a little broader.

04:47.917 --> 04:50.458
They're not supposed to engage
in unauthorized scans.

04:50.542 --> 04:53.125
But with everything that's been
happening lately, the

04:53.208 --> 04:55.375
Ministry of Peace enforcing
codes of conduct

04:55.458 --> 04:57.042
that situation
we had with Talia-

04:57.125 --> 05:00.583
You feel that he can no longer
be trusted to honor that rule.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.083
(John)
'Exactly.'

05:02.167 --> 05:04.208
And none of us here
are strong enough to

05:04.292 --> 05:05.833
block him if he tries
to scan us.

05:05.917 --> 05:10.000
If that happens, our involvement
with the Rangers, with you

05:10.083 --> 05:11.625
Lyta, the way
we have been providing evidence

05:11.708 --> 05:13.292
in the assassination
of President Santiago..

05:13.375 --> 05:14.667
...that's all gonna come out.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.708
And after that,
there are only two options.

05:16.792 --> 05:18.417
He turns us in,
we're court-martialed

05:18.500 --> 05:20.250
then shot for treason.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.708
Or we kill him before
he has a chance to tell anybody.

05:22.792 --> 05:25.750
I will not support murder.
We cannot kill him.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.875
Can we wound him? Just a little?

05:27.958 --> 05:29.333
(John)
'Ivanova..'

05:29.417 --> 05:32.958
...nobody is killing anybody,
not on my watch.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.750
Now, if those are the only two
options we have

05:34.833 --> 05:38.542
neither are acceptable.
We need others.

05:38.625 --> 05:42.167
Is there any way to prevent him
from coming aboard this station?

05:42.250 --> 05:44.125
We could blow up his ship.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.208
[sighs]

05:48.875 --> 05:53.792
There may be an alternative,
but it does carry some risk.

05:55.333 --> 05:57.917
Ah, Vir!

05:59.792 --> 06:02.750
- It is so good to see you.
- Oh, look what I got you.

06:02.833 --> 06:05.625
- Oh, salted!
- Yes.

06:05.708 --> 06:07.375
But what is this?

06:07.458 --> 06:10.583
Oh, it's a Minbari ceremonial
coat of welcoming.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.167
They gave it to me
when I arrived

06:12.250 --> 06:14.167
to take over
the diplomatic mission.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.583
I had to have the sleeves
shortened.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.917
- Do you like it?
- Yes, it's very nice.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.167
Wear it when you're there,
not here.

06:20.250 --> 06:22.292
You're a Centauri, remember?

06:22.375 --> 06:23.292
Alright. Come on.

06:23.375 --> 06:24.417
I want to hear about everything

06:24.500 --> 06:25.792
that happened on your trip.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.792
I've never been to Minbar.
What's it like?

06:27.875 --> 06:29.958
Oh, it's very clean.

06:30.042 --> 06:31.958
The people are very friendly
and warm

06:32.042 --> 06:33.917
except for the warrior caste.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.750
I don't think they like
foreigners, you know.

06:35.833 --> 06:38.958
But the religious caste,
very, very friendly.

06:39.042 --> 06:41.917
Now, do, do they speak of me
very often?

06:44.042 --> 06:47.125
- Only behind closed doors.
- Oh.

06:48.083 --> 06:51.417
The mountain's falling on me.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.958
It's falling.

06:54.042 --> 06:56.500
I need blood and tissue
samples analyzed fast.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.042
He's messed up on something,
I want to know what.

06:59.125 --> 07:01.792
Dr. Franklin, you'd better see
this. It may be a related case.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.667
- Alright. Symptoms?
- Traumatic shock.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.250
Total lack of consciousness..

07:08.333 --> 07:10.833
...respiration and heartbeat
way below normal.

07:10.917 --> 07:11.917
EEG ratings completely off--

07:12.000 --> 07:13.833
What does this
have to do with him?

07:13.917 --> 07:16.500
We found her just down the hall
from where he went nuts.

07:16.583 --> 07:18.833
She's a geological consultant.

07:18.917 --> 07:20.958
According to our records,
six months ago she broke her leg

07:21.042 --> 07:23.458
in three places while she
was climbing a mountain on Mars.

07:23.542 --> 07:26.292
She get caught in a landslide
and nearly killed.

07:26.375 --> 07:28.667
- The mountain fell on her.
- Exactly.

07:28.750 --> 07:29.875
Oh, hell.

07:31.458 --> 07:33.500
Test her neural pathways,
look for any sign of disruption.

07:33.583 --> 07:36.333
And I want his blood checked
for traces of Dust.

07:36.417 --> 07:37.917
Thank you.

07:40.292 --> 07:43.333
[intense music]

07:45.292 --> 07:47.292
- You okay, doctor?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

07:47.375 --> 07:50.208
I'm just a little on edge
lately, that's all.

07:50.292 --> 07:51.875
Look, I'm sorry
I barked at you, alright?

07:51.958 --> 07:53.875
You made the right call.
Good work.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.625
[device beeps]

07:59.708 --> 08:01.625
- Franklin.
- 'Just got word.'

08:01.708 --> 08:03.958
(Michael)
'Our friend Bester
is on his way in.'

08:05.792 --> 08:09.208
(male #1)
'Transport 1 to Babylon Control,
coming in.'

08:09.292 --> 08:10.917
(Susan)
'Confirmed, transport.
Stand by.'

08:13.500 --> 08:16.500
Everyone clear
the command deck. Now.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.708
I have to do a maintenance
routine.

08:17.792 --> 08:19.292
It'll take about ten minutes.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.417
Get some tea or something.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.583
(male #1)
'Standing by, Babylon Control.'

08:29.667 --> 08:31.667
'Request permission to dock.'

08:31.750 --> 08:36.583
(Susan)
'They don't know you,
your kind, the way I do.'

08:36.667 --> 08:39.125
They don't understand.

08:39.208 --> 08:42.167
They think it's some kind
of a joke.

08:42.250 --> 08:45.417
But nothing works with you
people.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.958
Nothing but force.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.333
Computer, activate forward
defense grid.

08:54.625 --> 08:58.625
(male #1)
'Babylon Control, are you there?
Transport to Babylon Control.'

08:58.708 --> 09:01.292
We can't risk throwing it all
away. Not because of you.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.667
I've been saying for weeks now

09:04.750 --> 09:06.917
the defense grid's been acting
funny.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.250
Defense grid, prepare to fire.

09:13.333 --> 09:14.458
- Fire!
- 'Delay that order.'

09:14.542 --> 09:16.333
[automated voice]
'Standing by.'

09:17.917 --> 09:19.208
Ivanova, don't do it.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.458
Don't throw your career away
on this!

09:22.542 --> 09:24.792
He's not worth it.

09:24.875 --> 09:27.333
If he gets on board, all of our
careers are finished anyway

09:27.417 --> 09:29.792
yours, mine,
everything we've worked for.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.000
Susan, we have got it covered.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.333
It'll be okay.
Delenn's plan will work.

09:34.417 --> 09:35.792
No, it won't.

09:35.875 --> 09:39.125
He's too strong.
They're always too strong.

09:39.208 --> 09:43.292
Damn it, John, there's just
always too many of them

09:43.375 --> 09:44.833
and not enough of us.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.083
What am I supposed to do?

09:50.875 --> 09:53.458
Fight them without becoming
them.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.833
Computer,
deactivate defense grid

10:00.917 --> 10:03.708
initiate docking maneuvers.

10:03.792 --> 10:06.625
[instrumental music]

10:09.708 --> 10:11.542
What the hell just happened
out there?

10:11.625 --> 10:13.542
I was stranded,
out of communication

10:13.625 --> 10:16.208
and suddenly I was hit by a
sense of great personal danger.

10:16.292 --> 10:17.500
Sorry, sir, I don't know.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.625
My orders are to have
you taken to the captain.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.500
Alright.
Let's get this over with.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.167
Captain,
I would like an explanation

10:31.250 --> 10:33.792
f-for this.

10:33.875 --> 10:37.208
Mr. Bester,
so good to see you again.

10:37.292 --> 10:39.917
I'd like to introduce you
to my associates.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.875
'These are Minbari telepaths.'

10:42.958 --> 10:47.125
Nothing like a level playing
field to ruin a Psi Cop's day.

10:47.208 --> 10:48.875
Am I right, Mr. Bester?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.375
Would you like to explain
what these

10:56.458 --> 10:58.875
individuals are doing here?

10:58.958 --> 11:00.625
Oh, I'd be happy to.

11:00.708 --> 11:03.583
How do you want it?
Polite or straight up?

11:06.083 --> 11:08.250
- Straight up.
- Alright.

11:13.125 --> 11:15.042
I don't like you.

11:15.125 --> 11:19.583
I don't like you, the Psi Corps,
that badge or that uniform.

11:19.667 --> 11:21.083
Your attitude stinks.

11:21.167 --> 11:23.417
Frankly, I don't trust you as
far as I can throw this station.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.250
And I hold you
personally responsible

11:26.333 --> 11:27.917
for what happened
to Talia Winters.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.417
That operation was initiated
by my predecessors in the Corps.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.042
When we found out
about the program

11:33.125 --> 11:34.417
we discontinued it at once.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.833
I had no idea--

11:35.917 --> 11:38.333
- Oh, you lying sack of--
- On the other hand..

11:39.917 --> 11:43.708
We learned some interesting
things about Miss Winters..

11:43.792 --> 11:47.083
...in the course
of her debriefing and dissec-

11:48.667 --> 11:51.625
'That is, examination.'

11:51.708 --> 11:53.958
Don't.
He's trying to provoke you.

11:54.042 --> 11:55.542
Strong emotion
is harder to block

11:55.625 --> 11:58.625
and he can ride that
into the rest of your mind.

11:58.708 --> 12:00.625
That's why they're here.

12:00.708 --> 12:02.417
We don't trust you
to abide by the rules

12:02.500 --> 12:04.292
prohibiting unauthorized scans.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.542
A normal human telepath
can't stop you..

12:06.625 --> 12:08.792
but a group of Minbari telepaths
together

12:08.875 --> 12:11.000
are strong enough
to block even a Psi Cop.

12:11.083 --> 12:14.167
We can't conduct business
with outsiders hanging around.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.958
We're not conducting
any business

12:16.042 --> 12:18.250
until we set
some new ground rules.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.042
Doctor.

12:20.125 --> 12:21.667
I did a little research

12:21.750 --> 12:24.042
came up with the drug used
to suppress the abilities

12:24.125 --> 12:25.875
of telepaths
who won't join the Psi Corps.

12:25.958 --> 12:27.542
Now you've got two choices..

12:27.625 --> 12:30.167
...either we use this
to suppress your abilities

12:30.250 --> 12:32.167
to scan while you're here..

12:32.250 --> 12:34.708
...or wherever we go, they go.

12:34.792 --> 12:36.375
On matters of planetary security

12:36.458 --> 12:39.042
you are obligated to provide
unconditional assistance.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.042
Fine, file a complaint back
home. We'll do the same.

12:42.125 --> 12:44.000
Hell, we'll have
a press conference.

12:44.083 --> 12:47.333
Let's get all this out
in the open. Hmm?

12:47.417 --> 12:48.875
You won't do that.

12:48.958 --> 12:50.875
You have just as much to lose
as we do.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.917
Are you sure of that,
Mr. Bester?

12:54.375 --> 12:57.667
Think about it, really hard.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.833
Because it comes down to this..

12:59.917 --> 13:02.333
...do you know more about us..

13:02.417 --> 13:05.625
...or do we know more about
what you've been up to lately?

13:05.708 --> 13:08.000
Far be it from me
to try and talk you out

13:08.083 --> 13:10.542
of your paranoia, captain.

13:10.625 --> 13:12.917
You choose not to trust me.

13:13.042 --> 13:16.333
Well, that's sad
and unfortunate.

13:16.417 --> 13:17.875
But unlike the rest of you

13:17.958 --> 13:20.750
I have no intention of letting
it get in the way of my work.

13:22.125 --> 13:23.667
Doctor.

13:27.833 --> 13:30.583
Trust, captain.

13:30.667 --> 13:33.458
'You should try it some time.'

13:33.542 --> 13:36.292
The drug requires three hours
to take effect.

13:36.375 --> 13:38.083
I'll see you in four.

13:38.167 --> 13:41.875
Perhaps then you'll all be
just a little less hysterical..

13:41.958 --> 13:44.250
...and a little bit more
constructive.

13:45.958 --> 13:49.042
I'm here to save your butts.

13:49.125 --> 13:53.875
Next time,
show a little gratitude.

14:00.208 --> 14:02.083
On the other hand..

14:02.167 --> 14:06.333
...maybe wounding him
isn't such a bad idea after all.

14:06.417 --> 14:10.417
I appreciate your willingness to
mediate in this dispute, Delenn.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.583
It is however most unfortunate
that the Drazi government

14:13.667 --> 14:16.000
chose not to have
these talks privately.

14:16.083 --> 14:17.667
Just between the two of us,
but--

14:17.750 --> 14:20.917
Centauri never speak
except to lie.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.208
You lie now, there is witness.

14:23.292 --> 14:26.958
Gentlemen, please. Nothing
is solved by recrimination.

14:27.042 --> 14:29.333
May I now hear both sides?

14:29.417 --> 14:30.875
Vizak?

14:30.958 --> 14:34.083
Drazi space invaded by Centauri.

14:34.167 --> 14:38.000
Many of our soldiers have died
bravely, defending our world.

14:38.083 --> 14:40.208
We look for peace.

14:40.292 --> 14:43.708
We say to the Centauri,
what price is peace?

14:43.792 --> 14:45.625
(Londo)
'We want a buffer zone.'

14:45.708 --> 14:47.792
We told you that
when this all started.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.125
If you had listened then

14:49.208 --> 14:52.042
we could have avoided
considerable bloodshed.

14:52.125 --> 14:55.417
Ambassador Mollari,
what would you consider a

14:55.500 --> 14:58.000
reasonable buffer zone?

14:59.792 --> 15:03.583
The seven colony worlds
in that particular corridor.

15:03.667 --> 15:06.250
You asked for only two
when this began.

15:06.333 --> 15:09.292
Yes, and if you'd been willing
to give us two at that time

15:09.375 --> 15:10.625
we'd have agreed to it.

15:10.708 --> 15:12.958
But since then we have spent
a great deal of time

15:13.042 --> 15:14.667
'and money to secure that area.'

15:14.750 --> 15:16.958
'We now require more.'

15:17.042 --> 15:18.875
Unacceptable.

15:18.958 --> 15:20.667
If that is your decision

15:20.750 --> 15:22.083
then we have nothing else
to discuss.

15:22.167 --> 15:23.458
Ambassador--

15:23.542 --> 15:26.167
Remember what happened
to the Narn Homeworld, Vizak.

15:26.250 --> 15:29.500
You would not want the same
to happen to your own.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.375
Ask G'Kar.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.958
I'm sorry.

15:41.667 --> 15:45.250
Well, that could've gone better.

15:45.333 --> 15:49.250
Yes. One is foolish,
the other frightened.

15:49.333 --> 15:53.708
Telling which one is which,
that's the hard part.

15:53.792 --> 15:56.208
You know, while I have you here,
I want to thank you again

15:56.292 --> 15:59.250
for helping with
my assignment on Minbar.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.875
At first I didn't think
I'd like it there

16:00.958 --> 16:02.708
but the longer I stay there

16:02.792 --> 16:05.042
the harder it is for me
to leave.

16:05.125 --> 16:07.667
Sometimes I think maybe Londo
could use a visit there.

16:07.750 --> 16:10.625
I, I think it would do him good.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.667
A darkness carried in the heart

16:12.750 --> 16:14.625
cannot be cured
by moving the body

16:14.708 --> 16:17.042
from one place to another.

16:17.125 --> 16:18.792
I don't think
there is anything

16:18.875 --> 16:20.417
that can be done for him now.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.250
That's because
you don't know him.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.542
Someday he'll surprise you.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.083
(Alfred)
The problem we're facing
involves

16:30.167 --> 16:32.375
not just the Psi Corps..

16:32.458 --> 16:35.042
...but planetary security.

16:35.125 --> 16:36.875
For the last year, we've been
after one of the biggest

16:36.958 --> 16:40.208
manufacturers of Dust in Earth
territory.

16:40.292 --> 16:43.083
Dust is a major problem
for telepaths..

16:43.167 --> 16:46.250
...because it allows the user
to commit a kind of..

16:46.333 --> 16:48.333
...telepathic rape.

16:48.417 --> 16:52.083
The drug enhances the latent
telepathic gene in most humans

16:52.167 --> 16:54.583
and gives it a destructive power
for several hours.

16:54.667 --> 16:57.542
Yeah, we've heard about it.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.583
It lets you invade
someone's mind

16:59.667 --> 17:02.500
experience everything
they've experienced..

17:02.583 --> 17:05.917
every touch, every sensation.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.250
You live their entire life
in a matter of minutes.

17:09.333 --> 17:12.583
The experience is intense
and highly addictive.

17:12.667 --> 17:15.917
Usually the victim recovers
in a few days, but..

17:16.000 --> 17:19.917
...when a telepath is violated,
he almost never recovers.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.875
So, we have a vested interest

17:21.958 --> 17:24.875
in finding the people
responsible for this.

17:24.958 --> 17:26.708
We believe..

17:26.792 --> 17:31.083
...one of the main distributors
for Dust has come to Babylon 5.

17:31.167 --> 17:33.333
He may be right.

17:33.417 --> 17:36.583
Last night we had our first
Dust victim in six months.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.792
Two more cases were reported
just a few hours ago.

17:38.875 --> 17:41.667
Now that's more than we've ever
seen in the same time period.

17:41.750 --> 17:44.542
So, what's this got to do
with planetary security?

17:44.625 --> 17:47.125
I think he's taken
the next logical step..

17:47.208 --> 17:51.458
...and is preparing to sell
mass quantities of Dust..

17:51.542 --> 17:57.167
...to foreign governments
to be used as weapons.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.750
Think about it, Mr. Garibaldi.

17:59.833 --> 18:03.042
Do you know anyone here
who might have an interest

18:03.125 --> 18:06.000
in buying weapons
that can't be seen

18:06.083 --> 18:08.667
or traced until it's too late?

18:10.583 --> 18:12.500
(G'Kar)
'We had an understanding,
Mr. Lindstrom.'

18:12.583 --> 18:15.833
No commercial sales to anyone
else while we were negotiating.

18:15.917 --> 18:19.750
- Man's gotta earn a living.
- I'm paying you extremely well.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.375
If we conclude our deal.

18:21.458 --> 18:22.833
That depends on whether or not

18:22.917 --> 18:26.042
you and your product
are as advertised.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.708
You won't find better
anywhere else.

18:36.958 --> 18:38.750
That's just a sample.

18:38.833 --> 18:41.375
I don't carry much on me.
It's too risky.

18:41.458 --> 18:43.375
The rest is coming in later.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.792
How does it work?

18:47.875 --> 18:49.542
It accelerates
neural processing

18:49.625 --> 18:51.833
speeds it up
to ten times normal.

18:51.917 --> 18:53.625
Then it stimulates the gene

18:53.708 --> 18:56.375
that controls telepathic
development.

18:56.458 --> 18:59.750
After that,
you just go for a joy ride

18:59.833 --> 19:02.125
in somebody's mind.

19:02.208 --> 19:06.750
The more you use it, the more
it takes to get the same result.

19:06.833 --> 19:09.417
'It's a guaranteed franchise.'

19:09.500 --> 19:11.875
I'm not trying to create
a market.

19:11.958 --> 19:13.833
I'm looking for a weapon
that can be smuggled in

19:13.917 --> 19:17.042
concealed easily and used
to strike at our enemies

19:17.125 --> 19:19.292
learn their secrets,
perhaps even

19:19.375 --> 19:21.625
destroy them from the inside.

19:21.708 --> 19:23.458
Whatever.

19:23.542 --> 19:25.500
One warning..

19:25.583 --> 19:28.833
...this stuff is made
primarily for humans.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.375
It has a chemical master key

19:30.458 --> 19:32.625
that can address
the DNA sequence

19:32.708 --> 19:35.083
of most nonhuman species.

19:35.167 --> 19:40.417
But, as far as I know,
there are no Narn telepaths.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.958
You may not even carry the gene.

19:43.042 --> 19:46.417
There are no Narn telepaths now.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.792
But once, long ago, there were.

19:48.875 --> 19:50.833
Yeah? What happened to them?

19:50.917 --> 19:53.917
They and their families
were exterminated.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.292
The telepath gene has never been
strong enough in the survivors

19:57.375 --> 19:59.542
to breed a natural telepath.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.583
Then maybe that little packet
contains

20:03.667 --> 20:06.458
more than you hoped for.

20:06.542 --> 20:08.917
You can go now, Mr. Lindstrom.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.542
We'll conclude our deal once
the product has been tested.

20:15.458 --> 20:19.208
The product has never been
tested on Narns.

20:19.292 --> 20:22.167
It may not be safe.

20:22.250 --> 20:25.542
It may have unpredictable
results.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.375
So who are you gonna sucker
into volunteering?

20:28.458 --> 20:30.958
That is not your concern.

20:31.042 --> 20:32.500
Good day, Mr. Lindstrom.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.500
It's hard
getting used to the silence.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.792
Uh, what silence?

20:49.875 --> 20:51.292
Well, even when a telepath
isn't scanning

20:51.375 --> 20:53.542
you pick up a constant
background hum..

20:53.625 --> 20:56.667
...like voices just beyond
what you can hear.

20:56.750 --> 20:59.667
It's always there.
The sleepers turn it right off.

21:00.833 --> 21:02.667
It's a strange feeling.

21:02.750 --> 21:05.333
Like walking
with one of your eyes closed.

21:05.417 --> 21:06.792
So quiet.

21:06.875 --> 21:09.083
Oh, great.
Maybe it'll help your insomnia.

21:09.167 --> 21:10.208
Unnecessary.

21:10.292 --> 21:13.000
I sleep peacefully
and contentedly.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.750
The sleep of the just.

21:14.833 --> 21:16.375
Yeah, well, maybe the just might
have a few things

21:16.458 --> 21:18.000
to say about that, huh?

21:18.083 --> 21:20.625
Okay, that's enough.

21:20.708 --> 21:22.500
You don't like me any more than
the captain or Ivanova

21:22.583 --> 21:24.542
that's fine.

21:24.625 --> 21:26.417
But get this straight.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.333
My blood is the same color
as yours.

21:28.417 --> 21:32.417
And what I do, I do to protect
Earth, same as you.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.875
You don't like how I do it,
that's your prerogative.

21:35.958 --> 21:37.250
But there are things going on
out there

21:37.333 --> 21:39.333
that you know nothing about..

21:39.417 --> 21:40.875
...threats to the human race

21:40.958 --> 21:44.458
that no one ever hears about
because we stop them.

21:45.625 --> 21:47.958
There's dangers all around us.

21:48.042 --> 21:50.125
And whether you like us or not

21:50.208 --> 21:54.458
we may be all that stands
between you and the Abyss.

21:56.792 --> 21:59.875
[instrumental music]

22:01.208 --> 22:04.250

22:20.042 --> 22:21.875

[breathing heavily]

23:11.750 --> 23:14.500
(female #1)
I'm supposed to be up
for that promotion.

23:21.458 --> 23:23.792
(female #2)
My work is just as good
as his.

23:27.375 --> 23:30.167
[heavy breathing]

23:32.375 --> 23:33.958
Come on, Ashi.

23:34.042 --> 23:37.708
You're in on every black-market
deal that goes on around here.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.792
Anybody wants to move
contraband through here

23:39.875 --> 23:42.875
they gotta pay you
and your boys to lay off.

23:42.958 --> 23:45.208
So, what's the going price
for Dust these days, huh?

23:45.292 --> 23:47.083
How should I know?
I don't touch that stuff.

23:47.167 --> 23:48.500
It's too hot.

23:48.583 --> 23:50.167
I didn't ask if you used it.

23:50.250 --> 23:52.625
I'm not saying
you're selling it.

23:52.708 --> 23:55.667
And I don't even wanna know
what you'll touch.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.083
See, all I know is

23:57.167 --> 23:59.208
you got a piece of everything
around here.

23:59.292 --> 24:03.125
Either you know what's coming in
or you know somebody who knows.

24:04.625 --> 24:06.292
I told you.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.583
I don't know anything.

24:10.333 --> 24:12.250
He's lying.

24:12.333 --> 24:15.583
You stay out of my head.
Now, I got rights.

24:15.667 --> 24:18.083
I'm sorry.
D-did I say something?

24:19.292 --> 24:21.083
That happens sometimes.

24:21.167 --> 24:23.708
When I feel strong emotion
from two feet in front of me..

24:23.792 --> 24:27.500
...it just jumps out of my mouth
before I can stop it.

24:27.583 --> 24:29.792
Lies are particularly bad
that way.

24:29.875 --> 24:33.208
Oh, uh, please strike that
from the record, Mr. Garibaldi.

24:33.292 --> 24:36.792
As he says, officially,
he has rights.

24:38.208 --> 24:40.542
Unofficially, he's lying.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.208
Try not to think
about your complicity

24:42.292 --> 24:45.250
in this any further, Ashi.

24:45.333 --> 24:48.458
Your thoughts are leaking
all over the place.

24:51.417 --> 24:53.375
Okay.

24:53.458 --> 24:56.708
Look, this guy came to me

24:56.792 --> 24:58.833
said he wanted to bring Dust
through here.

24:58.917 --> 25:00.708
A lot of it.
Crates and crates of the stuff.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.583
No, I handle small stuff

25:02.667 --> 25:05.167
expensive stuff that won't cause
too much trouble.

25:06.208 --> 25:09.125
Dust is nothing but trouble.

25:10.667 --> 25:13.458
So I said no.

25:13.542 --> 25:16.125
But the guy's still here,
isn't he?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.708
I asked you a question.

25:19.792 --> 25:21.958
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
he's still here.

25:24.875 --> 25:26.750
He's got a place
somewhere in the Red Sector

25:26.833 --> 25:28.417
under an assumed name.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.167
He must've had at least
a dozen fake identicards.

25:31.250 --> 25:33.125
Alright.
So which one is he using now?

25:35.208 --> 25:37.125
Morgan something.

25:38.417 --> 25:40.750
Morgenstern. That's it.

25:40.833 --> 25:43.458
He said he's got a shipment
coming in this afternoon..

25:45.458 --> 25:47.083
...around 5:00.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.083
Get him out of here.

25:52.667 --> 25:55.292
Stick him in holding
while we check out his story.

25:59.375 --> 26:02.542
I thought the sleepers
kept you from scanning anyone.

26:02.625 --> 26:03.750
That's right.

26:03.833 --> 26:05.667
So, how'd you know he was lying?

26:05.750 --> 26:08.750
Well, the odds were good that
he was lying about something.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.000
Liars are always afraid that

26:10.083 --> 26:12.083
somebody's gonna see
through them.

26:12.167 --> 26:15.750
So, I just provided him
with a vehicle for his paranoia.

26:15.833 --> 26:18.333
Your captain's opinions
not withstanding

26:18.417 --> 26:21.708
the badge and the uniform do
have certain..

26:21.792 --> 26:22.708
...advantages.

26:22.792 --> 26:24.458
You like intimidation?

26:26.708 --> 26:28.292
Absolutely.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.625
Just like your badge
and your uniform.

26:46.458 --> 26:49.458
- This whole section--
- I said, I am not finished yet.

26:58.167 --> 27:00.833
Now I am finished.

27:00.917 --> 27:02.083
W-what did you think?

27:02.167 --> 27:03.417
I-I really want your opinion

27:03.500 --> 27:04.917
before I send my report
back home.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.625
Do you really think
the Minbari can be trusted?

27:07.708 --> 27:09.958
Oh, yes. Why?

27:10.042 --> 27:12.417
[scoffs]

27:12.500 --> 27:17.208
Ah, Vir, I have only seen
political naivete

27:17.292 --> 27:19.000
this complete once before

27:19.083 --> 27:22.625
in a speech before
the Centaurum by Lord Jarno.

27:22.708 --> 27:26.375
When he finished, we recommended
that-that he be sterilized

27:26.458 --> 27:28.292
in the best interests
of evolution

27:28.375 --> 27:30.708
and then we remembered
that he was married

27:30.792 --> 27:33.625
to Lady Ahnu, so really
there was no need.

27:33.708 --> 27:36.125
Londo, the Minbari
are very lovely people

27:36.208 --> 27:38.542
interested in culture
and art and--

27:38.625 --> 27:40.542
Decadent and soft.

27:40.625 --> 27:43.875
Probably out to impose
their views on everyone else.

27:43.958 --> 27:46.292
But their cities are
thousands of years old.

27:46.375 --> 27:47.958
The lack of new construction

27:48.042 --> 27:50.417
is the surest sign
of a faltering economy.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.250
This could make them
very aggressive.

27:52.333 --> 27:54.083
They are deeply spiritual
people, Londo.

27:54.167 --> 27:56.292
Yes, that you can leave in.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.750
It always scares people.

27:58.833 --> 28:02.500
Londo, a-are you deliberately
trying to drive me insane?

28:02.583 --> 28:04.000
The universe is already mad.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.875
Anything else
would be redundant.

28:05.958 --> 28:06.875
Londo..

28:06.958 --> 28:07.917
[bell chimes]

28:08.000 --> 28:09.458
Get that, would you?

28:11.625 --> 28:13.042
Yes?

28:15.583 --> 28:17.250
[body thuds]

28:17.333 --> 28:20.333
What did you drop now, Vir?

28:20.417 --> 28:22.000
Vir?

28:23.333 --> 28:24.792
[glass shatters]

28:28.167 --> 28:31.000
[intense music]

28:42.042 --> 28:43.458
(Alfred)
'We know where he is.'

28:43.542 --> 28:44.917
'We could've just gone
and picked him up.'

28:45.000 --> 28:46.625
(Michael)
'It's no go.'

28:46.708 --> 28:49.292
A guy like this is too smart
to keep the Dust in his place.

28:49.375 --> 28:50.875
If Ashi's right
about the shipment

28:50.958 --> 28:53.625
we can get him and the evidence
we need to bust him.

28:53.708 --> 28:55.667
You see, there's this little
thing called "due process."

28:55.750 --> 28:57.792
We're kind of funny about it.

28:57.875 --> 28:59.625
- Anything yet?
- 'Negative.'

28:59.708 --> 29:01.542
If I had my talent working

29:01.625 --> 29:03.625
I could've warned you
when he was coming.

29:03.708 --> 29:05.417
And if I had a baseball bat,
we could hang you

29:05.500 --> 29:07.250
from the ceiling
and play pinata.

29:10.417 --> 29:13.542
I still think I should've gone
right to G'Kar.

29:13.625 --> 29:16.208
We have no evidence
that he made the sale yet.

29:16.292 --> 29:19.167
Why annoy the Narn
without cause or if we're wrong?

29:19.250 --> 29:20.708
Shut off the problem
at the source

29:20.792 --> 29:23.542
and the rest attends to itself.

29:23.625 --> 29:25.208
A pinata, huh?

29:25.292 --> 29:29.042
So, you think of me as something
bright and cheerful

29:29.125 --> 29:32.917
full of toys and candy
for young children?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.042
Thank you.

29:34.125 --> 29:36.833
That makes me feel much better

29:36.917 --> 29:39.167
about our relationship.

29:39.250 --> 29:40.958
[beeping]

29:51.000 --> 29:53.208
Right on time.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.750
The boys in the lab say hello

29:56.792 --> 29:58.708
and you're behind in payments.

29:58.792 --> 30:00.792
They'll have it once
the deal is concluded.

30:00.875 --> 30:02.542
Haven't let you down yet,
have I?

30:02.625 --> 30:04.833
You're still alive, aren't you?

30:06.458 --> 30:07.458
Now!

30:07.542 --> 30:08.625
[high-pitch shrill]

30:08.708 --> 30:10.750
[screams]

30:10.833 --> 30:11.875
On the floor! Do it!

30:11.958 --> 30:13.750
[zapping]

30:16.000 --> 30:17.667
[groans]

30:17.750 --> 30:19.667
[high-pitched shrill continues]

30:19.750 --> 30:21.250
Alright, kill it!

30:21.333 --> 30:23.042
I said, on the floor!

30:25.750 --> 30:26.958
Right here.

30:31.750 --> 30:34.000
- Alright, get him out of here.
- Let's go.

30:39.333 --> 30:41.500
Oh.

30:41.583 --> 30:44.125
It is a beautiful thing.

30:44.208 --> 30:47.042
And with any luck, we got to it
before anyone else got hurt.

30:53.500 --> 30:56.542
[sobbing]

31:10.542 --> 31:12.292
[coughing]

31:14.833 --> 31:16.542
(Londo)
'G'Kar.'

31:16.625 --> 31:22.125
I can see that
you're obviously quite upset.

31:22.208 --> 31:25.000
And not quite yourself.

31:26.458 --> 31:28.750
P-perhaps we should..

31:28.833 --> 31:31.458
Yes, we will.

31:31.542 --> 31:33.917
[screaming]

31:37.917 --> 31:41.458
(male #2)
Your shuttle leaves
for Babylon 5 in two days.

31:41.542 --> 31:42.833
I hope that gives you
enough time

31:42.917 --> 31:44.583
to put your affairs in order.

31:44.667 --> 31:46.333
Before you go,
you'll be officially

31:46.417 --> 31:48.333
given the title of ambassador.

31:48.417 --> 31:50.667
Obviously we expect you
to represent

31:50.750 --> 31:52.958
our people as best you can.

31:53.042 --> 31:54.292
Any questions?

31:54.375 --> 31:56.125
Just one.

31:56.208 --> 31:59.833
I would like to know
why I was chosen for this honor.

31:59.917 --> 32:01.833
No one else wants it.

32:01.917 --> 32:05.667
The first four stations
were destroyed or vanished..

32:05.750 --> 32:08.167
...so it's not a very safe place
to live.

32:08.250 --> 32:11.333
And safety is much valued.

32:11.417 --> 32:12.958
Frankly, it's a mess.

32:13.042 --> 32:15.375
In other words, the position
is really little more than

32:15.458 --> 32:17.375
what, a joke?

32:17.458 --> 32:20.458
Yes. And a bad one, at that.

32:21.750 --> 32:23.542
I'm sorry, Londo.

32:23.625 --> 32:26.500
If I could have assigned anyone
else, I would have.

32:26.583 --> 32:29.000
But your name floated
to the top.

32:29.083 --> 32:31.875
And once Emperor Turhan saw it..

32:31.958 --> 32:34.583
...well, that was the end of it.

32:34.667 --> 32:37.458
[G'Kar laughing]

32:43.542 --> 32:46.208
Who would believe it?

32:46.292 --> 32:50.583
The great and powerful
Londo Mollari got his job..

32:50.667 --> 32:54.083
...because no one else was
stupid enough to take it!

32:54.167 --> 32:55.917
Get out of here.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.250
I have nothing to say to you.

32:58.333 --> 33:02.625
Oh, but there's
so much more to see, Mollari.

33:02.708 --> 33:07.375
How does it feel to be helpless,
to be the victim?

33:07.458 --> 33:10.583
Does it help you
to understand how we feel?

33:10.667 --> 33:13.708
Does it help you understand
our pain?

33:13.792 --> 33:16.583
Show me your secrets, Londo.

33:16.667 --> 33:18.958
Show me your secrets!

33:19.042 --> 33:20.042
(Londo)
What have you done?

33:20.125 --> 33:21.958
Only what you asked me to do.

33:22.042 --> 33:23.250
You had a problem
with Quadrant 37.

33:23.333 --> 33:24.458
We took care of it for you.

33:24.542 --> 33:27.333
Yes, but you killed
10,000 Narns!

33:27.417 --> 33:29.667
I didn't know you cared.

33:29.750 --> 33:31.250
Ten thousand, a hundred
thousand, a million

33:31.333 --> 33:33.125
what's the difference?

33:33.208 --> 33:36.500
They're Narns, ambassador.
Your sworn enemy.

33:36.583 --> 33:38.917
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn Homeworld

33:39.000 --> 33:41.250
while you're at it?

33:41.333 --> 33:43.542
One thing at a time, ambassador.

33:43.625 --> 33:45.542
'One thing at a time.'

33:45.625 --> 33:46.667
You!

33:48.167 --> 33:50.417
It was you.

33:50.500 --> 33:53.792
You were at
the center of it all.

33:53.875 --> 33:56.250
The others,
the ones you're working with.

33:56.333 --> 33:59.375
No, not anymore.
It was a mistake.

33:59.458 --> 34:01.083
I have nothing more to do
with them.

34:01.167 --> 34:03.500
Who are they? Tell me.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.458
Tell me or I'll rip it
from your mind.

34:05.542 --> 34:08.125
- No.
- Then I'll take it from you.

34:08.208 --> 34:10.208
Neuron by neuron.

34:10.292 --> 34:12.125
All of it, Mollari!

34:12.208 --> 34:14.167
All of it!

34:14.250 --> 34:17.292
[intense music]

34:21.208 --> 34:22.958
(Londo)
No more!

34:25.792 --> 34:27.083
(male #3)
'It is enough.'

34:29.500 --> 34:30.750
Who..

34:34.542 --> 34:35.667
Who's there?

34:35.750 --> 34:37.292
'Just us.'

34:39.167 --> 34:40.292
Who are you?

34:40.375 --> 34:45.583
I am, who I have always been.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.000
Father?

34:47.083 --> 34:49.625
It is too late for me, G'Kar.

34:50.708 --> 34:53.583
It is not too late for you.

34:54.750 --> 34:57.083
Honor my name.

34:58.458 --> 35:00.708
Honor..

35:00.792 --> 35:02.458
...my name.

35:02.542 --> 35:03.958
No.

35:05.417 --> 35:07.500
(G'Quan)
'We are a dying people, G'Kar.'

35:08.542 --> 35:10.000
'So are the Centauri.'

35:10.083 --> 35:13.583
Obsessed with each other's death
until death is all we can see

35:13.667 --> 35:16.750
and death is all we deserve.

35:16.833 --> 35:19.292
The Centauri started it.

35:19.375 --> 35:21.167
And will you continue

35:21.250 --> 35:23.542
until there are no more Narns

35:23.625 --> 35:25.333
and no more Centauri?

35:25.417 --> 35:27.875
If both sides are dead,
no one will care

35:28.000 --> 35:30.375
which side deserves the blame.

35:30.458 --> 35:33.917
It no longer matters
who started it, G'Kar.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.750
It only matters
who is suffering.

35:36.833 --> 35:38.333
No.

35:38.417 --> 35:42.125
No, I have an obligation
to honor my father's name.

35:42.208 --> 35:45.583
And how have you chosen
to honor that name?

35:45.667 --> 35:47.083
What is there left for Narn

35:47.167 --> 35:49.000
if all of creation
falls around us?

35:49.083 --> 35:50.917
There is nothing.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.125
No hope, no dream,
no future, no life..

35:56.458 --> 35:58.708
...unless we turn
from the cycle of death

35:58.792 --> 36:01.417
toward something greater.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.375
If we are a dying people

36:03.458 --> 36:06.458
then let us die with honor
by helping the others

36:06.542 --> 36:08.083
as no one else can.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.792
I don't understand.

36:09.875 --> 36:12.792
Because you have let
them distract you..

36:12.875 --> 36:15.000
...blind you with hate.

36:15.083 --> 36:17.625
You cannot see the battle
for what it is.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.667
We are fighting
to save one another.

36:19.750 --> 36:22.000
We must realize
we are not alone.

36:22.083 --> 36:24.875
We rise and fall together.

36:24.958 --> 36:28.417
'And some of us
must be sacrificed'

36:28.500 --> 36:31.042
'if all are to be saved.'

36:31.125 --> 36:33.458
Because if we fail in this

36:33.542 --> 36:36.167
then none of us will be saved

36:36.250 --> 36:39.875
and the Narn
will be only a memory.

36:42.208 --> 36:46.500
(G'Lan)
You have the opportunity,
here and now, to choose.

36:46.583 --> 36:48.750
To become something
greater and nobler

36:48.833 --> 36:52.125
and more difficult
than you have been before.

36:52.208 --> 36:57.042
The universe does not offer
such chances often, G'Kar.

36:57.125 --> 36:58.167
Why now?

36:59.792 --> 37:01.792
Why not earlier?

37:01.875 --> 37:05.583
All this time,
w-where have you been?

37:05.667 --> 37:07.667
(G'Lan)
I have always been here.

37:09.250 --> 37:12.042
[dramatic music]

37:39.667 --> 37:42.750
[instrumental music]

37:51.417 --> 37:54.417
[sobbing]

38:13.167 --> 38:15.667
Will he be alright?

38:15.750 --> 38:19.333
I think so.
We'll know in a few hours.

38:19.417 --> 38:21.167
You know, you shouldn't
be out of bed yourself.

38:21.250 --> 38:23.917
You got knocked around
pretty bad.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.833
I should be here.
He'll need me.

38:27.917 --> 38:29.708
Doctor.

38:29.792 --> 38:30.917
I'll be back.

38:34.125 --> 38:35.292
[tapping on glass]

38:48.083 --> 38:51.917
Citizen G'Kar, you are aware
of the charges against you?

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
I am.

38:53.083 --> 38:54.042
And you still decline

38:54.125 --> 38:56.542
presence of counsel?

38:56.625 --> 38:58.167
'Very well.'

38:58.250 --> 39:01.292
To the charges of assault
on Ambassador Mollari..

39:01.375 --> 39:03.042
...assault on Vir Cotto

39:03.125 --> 39:06.917
use and purchase of prohibited
material, how do you plead?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.333
Guilty, Your Honor.

39:09.417 --> 39:12.625
Captain, you wished to speak
on behalf of the defendant?

39:12.708 --> 39:14.917
Yes, Your Honor.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.875
I would only point out..

39:16.958 --> 39:19.417
...that during the period
that he was under the influence

39:19.500 --> 39:24.458
of Dust he was not acting
rationally or deliberately..

39:24.542 --> 39:27.542
...and that may constitute
extenuating circumstances.

39:27.625 --> 39:30.208
I'm sorry, captain,
I can't agree.

39:30.292 --> 39:32.917
Had G'Kar seized
the first person he came upon

39:33.000 --> 39:35.917
then your argument
might carry some weight.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.292
But he deliberately went
to Ambassador Mollari's quarters

39:39.375 --> 39:41.917
assaulted and seized his person.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.750
In my book,
that constitutes premeditation.

39:47.083 --> 39:50.417
Since there are no outstanding
points to be contested

39:50.500 --> 39:52.625
and the plea has been entered..

39:52.708 --> 39:54.625
...I am ready to pass judgment.

39:56.042 --> 39:59.167
Citizen G'Kar,
it is the decision of this court

39:59.250 --> 40:02.333
that you be confined
to the station prison facilities

40:02.417 --> 40:05.417
for a period of no less
than 60 days.

40:15.542 --> 40:17.625
I'm sorry it had to go this way.

40:17.708 --> 40:21.583
I, uh...thought you might like

40:21.667 --> 40:24.500
to have this while you're,
uh, away.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.833
No, you can keep it for now.

40:29.917 --> 40:31.667
Besides..

40:31.750 --> 40:34.792
...I am now somewhat closer
to the source.

40:44.750 --> 40:47.417
Londo, your hot Jala.
Just the way you like it.

40:47.500 --> 40:50.000
Oh, thanks, Vir.

40:50.083 --> 40:54.000
Looks like both of us
have been through a war, hm?

40:54.083 --> 40:56.708
I just wish
I could've stopped him.

40:56.792 --> 40:59.292
Oh, no, he would have torn
you to little pieces

40:59.375 --> 41:02.542
and then stomped
up and down on them.

41:02.625 --> 41:04.958
And then he would've gotten
nasty.

41:05.042 --> 41:06.833
[both chuckle]

41:08.083 --> 41:10.708
It's good to have you here
again, Vir.

41:10.792 --> 41:13.875
How long can you stay?
Another day or two, I hope?

41:13.958 --> 41:17.125
No, I just got word.
I have to leave tonight.

41:17.208 --> 41:19.208
Centauri Prime wants me back
on Minbar

41:19.292 --> 41:21.708
for some special ceremony.

41:21.792 --> 41:25.750
Ah. Well, good. Good.

41:25.833 --> 41:29.042
They are seeing
the value in your position.

41:29.125 --> 41:32.042
It should never be a joke
to them, Vir.

41:32.125 --> 41:33.958
Never let them think that.

41:36.208 --> 41:37.708
I won't.

41:45.333 --> 41:47.292
I hope you don't mind the rush
to get you off station

41:47.375 --> 41:48.458
Mr. Bester, but the doc says

41:48.542 --> 41:50.208
that injection's gonna wear off
soon.

41:50.292 --> 41:51.958
Well, you know how it is.

41:52.042 --> 41:53.292
I do, indeed.

41:53.375 --> 41:55.250
For what it's worth,
Mr. Garibaldi

41:55.333 --> 41:56.917
I enjoyed working with you.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.458
We made a good team.

41:58.542 --> 42:00.458
Perhaps we'll do it again
sometime.

42:00.542 --> 42:01.958
Not a chance.

42:04.792 --> 42:07.292
You couldn't have gotten here
two minutes earlier?

42:07.375 --> 42:10.208
I tried to send to you,
but I couldn't get through.

42:10.292 --> 42:11.542
Doesn't matter.

42:11.625 --> 42:13.917
We'll finish
our business here later.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.333
You know, I said all along

42:16.417 --> 42:19.500
this whole Dust idea
wasn't going to work.

42:19.583 --> 42:21.750
We spent five years
developing this stuff

42:21.833 --> 42:24.292
tying it into latent genes

42:24.375 --> 42:25.542
and it hasn't produced

42:25.625 --> 42:27.583
one telepath
of acceptable strength

42:27.667 --> 42:29.917
among the normal population.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.458
Oh, well, at least we got it out
of the hands of aliens

42:32.542 --> 42:35.125
and back among the humans
where it belongs.

42:46.250 --> 42:49.833
(G'Quanm)
We are fighting
to save one another.

42:49.917 --> 42:52.750
And some of us
must be sacrificed

42:52.833 --> 42:55.000
if all are to be saved.

42:56.792 --> 42:59.875
