01:08.600 --> 01:12.199
We have to explain in the simplest way
for you to understand

01:12.360 --> 01:14.719
who you are,
but you won't know who you were.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.479
The government removed your memory
to restore you to society,

01:17.520 --> 01:19.399
without taking away your physical life.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.119
Life.

01:22.880 --> 01:27.319
Warsaw, 2030

01:28.400 --> 01:31.639
You must be familiar
with the 1997 classic film "Men in Black",

01:32.200 --> 01:35.959
directed by Barry Sonnenfeld
and starring Tommy Lee Jones and Billy...

01:40.160 --> 01:42.199
They had a similar gadget.

01:42.440 --> 01:45.039
One click and a patient
remembered nothing, at all.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.559
Sir!

01:51.520 --> 01:52.879
Yes...

01:56.080 --> 01:58.639
Anyway, the situation is similar.

01:58.800 --> 02:02.039
You lost your old identity
but gained a new, better life.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.759
Of course, we'll provide you with a good job,

02:04.800 --> 02:06.039
appreciate it.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.318
And we promise the government
won't bother you anymore.

02:10.199 --> 02:14.079
We thank you for your sacrifice
for the betterment of our reborn, national state.

02:14.160 --> 02:17.239
We wish you all the best
in your future endeavors.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.079
Where is he?

02:28.280 --> 02:30.319
Where is he?

02:34.720 --> 02:42.479
THE MAN WITH THE MAGIC BOX

02:44.160 --> 02:47.679
A FEW DAYS EARLIER

03:28.400 --> 03:31.039
with a special appearance of

03:31.920 --> 03:35.119
with a special appearance of

03:40.600 --> 03:42.319
Don't lose it.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.519
Relax,

03:52.720 --> 03:54.599
I told you it would come back to you.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.799
Sooner or later you'll remember everything.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.079
So, what's my name?

04:02.480 --> 04:03.319
Adam.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.759
I know, it was a joke.

04:09.240 --> 04:09.999
Right.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.599
Try to blend in.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.319
So...

04:15.040 --> 04:16.238
good luck.

04:16.680 --> 04:19.678
casting

04:24.520 --> 04:26.839
costumes

04:35.240 --> 04:38.799
You shouldn't hang up, sir.
This is the best offer, you'd better hold off.

04:41.880 --> 04:42.719
Yes, yes.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.359
Mister Osowiecki said that...

04:44.400 --> 04:45.119
Yes, yes.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.919
Of course,
I remember. Yes.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.359
Yes, yes!

04:51.800 --> 04:52.359
No.

04:59.320 --> 05:02.319
make-up

05:02.800 --> 05:04.599
No, oh no.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.719
Forget it.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.399
You won't find it on this side of the river.
Forget it.

05:08.680 --> 05:12.079
music

05:16.000 --> 05:17.519
Come, come.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.679
The building is uninhabited,

05:19.760 --> 05:21.879
because the city has some unresolved
issues with the descendants

05:21.920 --> 05:24.479
from before the World War II,
can you believe it?

05:24.760 --> 05:25.719
Are you with me?

05:25.880 --> 05:29.319
So! Theoretically you can't live here,

05:29.400 --> 05:31.439
no building commissioning and so on.

director of photography

05:31.560 --> 05:33.719
But since I have to put you here,
then well...

05:34.160 --> 05:35.599
editor

05:35.720 --> 05:37.479
Come.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.999
I've cleaned one of the flats upstairs,
strange layout.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.639
It looks like servant's quarters.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.879
I haven't touched the rest.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.479
Come, come.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.759
Do you know how old this light bulb is?

05:52.560 --> 05:53.679
Very old!

05:53.880 --> 05:55.319
And it works!

05:56.200 --> 05:56.879
Come.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.119
Come, come.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.199

06:10.840 --> 06:11.719

06:12.680 --> 06:13.519
Take it.

06:15.600 --> 06:21.719

06:25.240 --> 06:27.359
And now I'll show you something cool.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.319
Come.

Do you get it?

06:53.120 --> 06:55.519
Give me your hand.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.199
Adam, you have insufficient funds
in your account.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.559
So maybe this...

07:15.040 --> 07:18.119
Thank you for your transaction.
Do you need a loan?

07:19.040 --> 07:20.279
OK, good.

07:20.920 --> 07:23.519
Tomorrow you'll have
the container on the street.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.759
I'll see you in two weeks,
when you get settled.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.799
When you get some money.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.959
First week free of charge.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.559
You know,

07:31.800 --> 07:33.279
I risk a lot here

07:33.480 --> 07:35.439
so, if you could...

07:35.840 --> 07:37.599
send a thousand points or so my way?

07:37.720 --> 07:39.359
Every month.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.999
You can get cheap cash from the Prols

07:42.040 --> 07:43.799
on the other side of the river.

07:43.960 --> 07:44.959
Ah,

07:45.720 --> 07:47.319
and don't you forget to go to work

07:47.400 --> 07:49.359
or they'll send you back.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.959
Bye.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.359
We will implant a chip In your body,

08:25.440 --> 08:27.919
it will be your new identity,
your credit card...

08:28.040 --> 08:29.639
Meanwhile in Warsaw,

08:29.720 --> 08:32.279
the head of the Visegrad Union,
Roman Lebik,

08:32.360 --> 08:34.359
reassured his allies at the convention,

08:34.440 --> 08:36.558
that the cities of our homelands

08:36.640 --> 08:39.799
are perfectly protected
by the missile defense shield.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.399
The incidents that have taken place
in eastern Slovakia

08:44.560 --> 08:47.439
are the result of opposition sabotage.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.439
Burgers and energy drink.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.479
Roman Lebik also confirmed
the quotas of military contingents

08:52.600 --> 08:56.119
for joint defense and
counteroffensive operations.

09:09.320 --> 09:10.279
Hi.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.959
So, how are you?

09:12.400 --> 09:15.119
You won't believe
what happened to me yesterday.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.879
So:

09:18.160 --> 09:21.399
I go for a walk with my little girl,
right, just like we always do and we,

09:21.600 --> 09:25.719
you know, circle the apartment building
once, twice, three times, yeah,

09:25.880 --> 09:30.079
and we meet this guy form the apartment 20,
you know the guy, yeah.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.999
Excuse me, whose bag is this?

10:13.520 --> 10:16.319
I can see you've mastered
the art of vacuuming.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.999
This is your personal transporter
for equipment and cleaning products

10:23.200 --> 10:25.679
of the biggest chemical
and pharmaceutical company,

10:25.760 --> 10:28.079
which is destroying this poor planet.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.519
There,

10:30.760 --> 10:33.679
you can't go behind that door,
this is zone zero.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.039
You don't clean there.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.399
It's top secret.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.839
Our masters and benefactors,
our patrons and protectors work there.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.519
You vacuum the floor, clean the desks.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.119
If you find something valuable,
put it in the locker

10:47.200 --> 10:49.719
then you empty the bin and move on.

10:50.080 --> 10:53.319
Unless there's a power break,
just like right now.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.759
In the summer,
you do the empty desks by the windows.

10:58.440 --> 11:01.999
But when it's dark,
you stand still and wait for the backup lights.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.679
The lights start off bright

11:06.880 --> 11:09.159
and then dim a little.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.279
Over there you have lifts.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.399
They eat up most of the power,
to get the trapped ones to their destination.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.959
Usually, you just wait a minute,

11:17.640 --> 11:21.279
but if the lights don't come back,
you can take an extra break.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.519
Not today.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.919
Have a good first day at work.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.239
Hey, you peeper!

12:46.640 --> 12:48.999
Riddle me this: what animal

12:49.360 --> 12:54.119
walks on four legs in the morning,
on two in the afternoon and on three in the evening?

12:57.120 --> 12:59.279
I thought so.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.639
Watch out for this one, she's crazy.
She'll bring you misfortune.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.199
A day is a life of a man...

13:16.320 --> 13:17.559
Too late.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.199
But I appreciate it.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.599
I'll give you good advice:
don't be too chummy with the office staff.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.199
We'll never be mates.

13:27.560 --> 13:30.439
I'd also try to spend as little time
as possible with this moron, Bernard.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.559
He can be really dangerous.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.479
Do you know that he lives
in a broom closet?

13:40.960 --> 13:43.319
Come with me for a second.

13:51.160 --> 13:55.679
In a normal situation,
you should be asking me out right now.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.119
Do you want to go out?

13:57.680 --> 13:59.159
What a nerve!

14:00.080 --> 14:02.519
Just like Bernie.

14:05.320 --> 14:07.119
Boy, you are direct.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.679
I appreciate the offer,

14:08.760 --> 14:10.999
but you know,
I work on one of the highest floors

14:11.120 --> 14:12.999
of one of the highest buildings in Warsaw.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.439
So do I.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.799
You didn't let me finish.

14:18.520 --> 14:22.119
You interrupted me,
and I had a really cool bit prepared.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.239
You distracted me.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.319
Adam, collect the package.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.079
Adam Nowak,
please collect the package.

15:00.840 --> 15:01.919
Thank you.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.759
I hate my job, I'm lonely and bitter.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.639
But I don't blame the Creator.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.239
When I was little they thought, I had Asperger's,

15:52.360 --> 15:54.959
then Tourette's, but I just tell the truth.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.399
Maybe you just can't lie?

16:00.320 --> 16:01.599
I can't lie.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.399
I lied.
Of course, I can lie.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.479
So, how did you get here?

16:18.680 --> 16:19.759
In a boat.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.599
Why in a boat?

16:21.800 --> 16:24.479
I don't know.
Maybe I'm afraid of the attack.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.199
Don't be stupid.

16:26.840 --> 16:27.999
Subway.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.119
The subway is the safest,
they won't blow it up.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.119
It's too expensive,
it's not worth it.

16:32.680 --> 16:36.039
They only destroy objects
when land tenancy is running out,

16:36.320 --> 16:39.159
this way they govern through fear.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.519
Bernard...

16:43.640 --> 16:46.399
Is it true that you live in a broom closet?

16:47.600 --> 16:48.759
Come on.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.679
No hacker will steal my password.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.919
Get in!

17:21.839 --> 17:23.199
Don't worry, I don't bite.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.559
And don't suck either.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.079
Just joking.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.959
Have you ever thought about

17:35.240 --> 17:37.919
going on a disability pension?

17:39.760 --> 17:40.919
No way.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.159
It's a great ruse for thieves.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.879
I've been working in the company
for as long as I can remember,

18:19.080 --> 18:21.919
and when I had a problem
with a mortgage in Swiss francs

18:22.080 --> 18:23.999
they offered me this room

18:24.080 --> 18:25.959
so I wouldn't end up on the street.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.599
I don't need much.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.599
I like it here.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.519
It's nice of them.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.999
Right?

18:44.240 --> 18:45.359
A vitamin?

18:49.440 --> 18:50.959
Don't you miss windows?

18:52.960 --> 18:54.559
A view?

18:55.440 --> 18:56.879
Space?

19:11.960 --> 19:13.439
Strange.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.519
I've never thought about it before.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.839
And besides,
no one's watching me.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.199
Adam, can I ask you a question?

19:24.240 --> 19:25.559
Please.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.759
I mean, ask away.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.599
Where did you come from, man?

19:51.600 --> 19:53.799
You didn't clean my desk.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.159
You don't deserve me taking it.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.839
- Come on...
- No "come on", I said no.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.479
The salesman swore on Allah it's real.

20:16.720 --> 20:20.039
And that's why
we're from two different worlds.

20:27.320 --> 20:28.999
I appreciate the gesture,

20:29.200 --> 20:31.279
it must have cost

20:31.640 --> 20:34.119

20:34.800 --> 20:37.679
My grandma would call you romantic.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.719
Gallant.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.719
You're nice, really,
but sorry.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.799
You'll be chasing me.

20:48.960 --> 20:49.719
Yeah!

20:49.840 --> 20:52.599
Only if I catch my scarf
in the door of your car.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.319
Do you have a car?

20:56.480 --> 20:57.919
You're not helping yourself

21:56.760 --> 21:59.119
which aren't dangerous
in the organisms of these people

21:59.240 --> 22:00.639
but which could be dangerous here.

22:54.640 --> 22:59.279
I remember every word,
your every smile.

23:01.800 --> 23:05.119
Today, I noticed the first gray hair

23:05.240 --> 23:07.279
on your temple...

23:10.960 --> 23:14.479
It moved me immensely

23:16.520 --> 23:19.159
I still remember the day, when...

23:19.720 --> 23:22.599
I saw you for the first time

23:42.200 --> 23:45.239
So quiet and cheerful.

23:46.720 --> 23:49.559
Look at the gossamer

23:49.680 --> 23:53.039
Silver threads floating in the air.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.119
Like clouds...

25:35.080 --> 25:37.559
We can bang like this sometimes

25:37.880 --> 25:39.199
For sport.

25:40.360 --> 25:43.599
And then you hold me and let me go.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.039
It's not personal.

25:46.560 --> 25:50.319
If I find someone who gives me
sense of security, I'll follow him

25:50.480 --> 25:52.599
even to the edge of the world,

25:52.640 --> 25:54.319
but it's not you.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.279
I'd better go now.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.279
Thanks for the orgasm.

26:47.960 --> 26:51.919
Try to get more comfortable, loosen up and relax.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.239
Don't be as stiff as a poker.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.439
Relax, just relax.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.639
Now, look at the wall in front of you

27:03.760 --> 27:07.879
and search for a space
where you can visualize a big triangle.

27:10.400 --> 27:13.399
Then imagine there's a circle

27:13.480 --> 27:16.319
inside that triangle.

27:18.080 --> 27:21.239
If the image inside your mind
starts to blur,

27:21.360 --> 27:25.239
try again patiently and calmly.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.319
Stay watchful and focused.

27:32.120 --> 27:35.599
Triangle with a circle.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.959
Triangle with a circle.

27:39.600 --> 27:43.039
Again and again.

27:45.520 --> 27:49.759
If it's possible, try not to blink.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.999
Close your eyes.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.719
What are you doing here?

27:59.960 --> 28:01.399
What are you doing here?

28:14.440 --> 28:16.399
What are you doing here?

28:22.600 --> 28:24.479
Come on doggy,

28:25.520 --> 28:26.879
let's go.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.519
Come on.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.559
While breathing out imagine

28:49.640 --> 28:54.159
that the number three appears
in front of you three times.

28:55.280 --> 28:58.319
While repeating in your head:

28:58.520 --> 29:02.799
three, three, three.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.879
Do it now.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.399
Breathe in,

29:11.360 --> 29:14.159
breathe in.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.479
And when you breathe out

29:16.920 --> 29:17.799
Three!

29:18.720 --> 29:20.239
Three!

29:22.000 --> 29:23.159
Three!

29:25.680 --> 29:28.079
Relax now.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.919
If any of your muscles are tensed,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.959
It's not enough to think about them,

29:34.040 --> 29:36.199
You have to relax them.

29:37.640 --> 29:40.879
Relax the muscles of your face.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.959
You're now relaxing the muscles
of your face.

29:47.680 --> 29:50.079
Your forehead.

29:51.520 --> 29:54.279
Make sure you're not frowning.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.959
We must be really careful.

30:19.240 --> 30:22.119
You're aware of consequences.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.599
I just came to get a sip of water.

30:38.120 --> 30:40.399
Goria, your free water limit is up.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.479
The times we live in!

30:50.000 --> 30:52.159
You were in my dreams last night.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.439
It's obvious.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.159
Anything else?

30:56.240 --> 30:57.999
No, only you and two men.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.359
Fuck off.

31:18.880 --> 31:21.479
I don't know if this is a good idea.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.759
Wait, Bernard.

31:33.840 --> 31:36.959
This is a pacemeter, there are lamps inside,
it needs to warm up.

31:37.960 --> 31:39.239
I know.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.119
I had a history of technology at school, too.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.559
Beautiful,

31:49.960 --> 31:51.639
sweet,

31:53.800 --> 31:55.679
kitty, kitty, kitty.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.999
Bernard, it's not like that!

31:58.160 --> 32:00.439
It's supposed to play songs.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.279
I swear, it works.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.639
Don't worry, it happens.

32:04.680 --> 32:06.839
The city increased the fluoride level
in the water, you're hallucinating.

32:06.880 --> 32:07.839
Bernard, please!

32:07.880 --> 32:09.719
And now take it and get out!

32:12.440 --> 32:14.559
Get this shit out of here.

32:15.960 --> 32:19.359
- Take it and don't you ever bring this shit here again...
- What?

32:19.440 --> 32:21.439
- ...never again, you moron!
- All right!

32:21.560 --> 32:22.439
Get out!

32:22.560 --> 32:24.479
I'm sorry, I'm turning it off.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.959
Wait, I want to say goodbye.

34:03.480 --> 34:04.399
No!

34:12.960 --> 34:14.119
Bernard.

34:16.280 --> 34:17.399
Bernard.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.518
You have to come by.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.639
You have to help me.

34:23.040 --> 34:25.119
You have to fix something for me.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.239
No way.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.958
Please, I know you can.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.518
I can't, I have to work.

34:34.800 --> 34:35.998
Bernard.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.559
It's very important for me, Bernard.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.839
Do you hear me?

34:49.040 --> 34:50.279
Okay.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.958
Just let me finish this.

34:54.520 --> 34:55.998
How many do you have left?

34:56.080 --> 34:57.519
Five walls.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.999
Oh, there you are.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.239
Goria!

35:16.040 --> 35:18.199
I would like to share with you
something I discovered.

35:18.240 --> 35:19.759
What? There's oil coming down your faucet?

35:19.800 --> 35:22.519
I wouldn't share it with anybody,
or the hell will break loose at your home.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.279
Stop following me.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.159
OK, just a minute,

35:26.320 --> 35:27.919
I wanted to show you something special.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.199
I've seen it.

35:29.960 --> 35:31.479
I wouldn't go that far.

35:31.720 --> 35:33.519
There's not much to boast about.

35:34.240 --> 35:36.279
I know you really like me.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.239
You don't have much competition.

35:38.400 --> 35:41.479
Most of them are gay,
and the nice boys are in the army.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.479
We can go now.

35:45.080 --> 35:47.999
Good, go to get the tools,
I'll be right back.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.279
Go get the tools,
he'll be right back.

35:50.360 --> 35:52.999
Just watch out for germs and viruses.

35:57.640 --> 36:00.079
You don't look good,
what's wrong with you?

36:02.960 --> 36:04.559
Will you come?

36:05.680 --> 36:07.559
If I do, it's only out of pity.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.519
Excellent.
Fine with me.

36:11.080 --> 36:14.159
I would sit on you deep down
and fuck you hard.

36:15.880 --> 36:17.599
That's nice.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.959
So, I'll come by when my period's gone.

36:48.960 --> 36:50.759
Ground floor.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.559
I don't know.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.599
I'm not going anywhere, sorry.

37:14.320 --> 37:15.519
Bernard,

37:16.760 --> 37:19.199
I beg you, you have to help me.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.919
No way, it won't work.

37:33.440 --> 37:34.879
I can't do it.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.319
Please, mate, it's just few steps from here.

37:38.000 --> 37:38.959
You can do it.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.319
Read my lips: I can't.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.199
Bernard.

37:45.160 --> 37:46.519
Let me go.

37:49.120 --> 37:51.519
I'm sorry, my legs are asleep.

37:57.080 --> 37:58.079
Bernard,

37:58.520 --> 37:59.759
I'm sorry.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.999
Everything's going to be fine.

38:10.240 --> 38:13.119
Nearby there is a place
with an unlimited Internet.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.839
Go there.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.679
Be careful.

38:18.320 --> 38:19.079
Go.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.199
Please, help me up.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.959
My legs are asleep.

39:04.360 --> 39:05.359
Excuse me.

39:05.440 --> 39:06.559
Wait.

39:10.760 --> 39:11.879
Yes?

39:13.560 --> 39:15.719
I'd like to connect to the Internet.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.759
You're in the right place.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.119
Water.

40:03.080 --> 40:05.079
Twice filtered.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.039
Thank you.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.239
Stop!

40:47.240 --> 40:48.439
Shit!

40:49.520 --> 40:51.439
We have a fugitive.

42:11.360 --> 42:14.719
Tape B, recording one.

42:16.120 --> 42:17.559
Modification.

42:22.240 --> 42:27.559
In your current level of superconsciousness,

42:29.000 --> 42:32.479
in a familiar scenery,

42:33.040 --> 42:35.719
build yourself a workshop to do

42:35.800 --> 42:38.519
mind perfecting exercises.

42:40.560 --> 42:43.919
Let it be bright, roomy space.

42:45.600 --> 42:48.519
Furnish it with comfortable

42:48.560 --> 42:51.399
and esthetically pleasing items.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.879
Lay a soft carpet on the floor.

43:11.480 --> 43:14.519
WARSAW, 1952

43:58.240 --> 44:00.039
[With party toward a better future]

44:00.080 --> 44:01.879
Come with us, citizen.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.119
Come, come.

44:05.880 --> 44:07.799
I live here, comrade.

44:10.760 --> 44:13.239
What do you have there?
Let us see!

44:14.760 --> 44:16.759
I don't really know...

44:17.000 --> 44:18.879
my mom sent me.

44:24.560 --> 44:25.879
Open it.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.239
Go on, open it.

44:34.200 --> 44:36.839
Never mind, comrade engineer,
you're free to go.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.359
Thank you. Thank you.

44:46.680 --> 44:48.519
Thank you.

45:56.520 --> 45:58.799
Have you seen my dog?

47:04.800 --> 47:08.399
Do you perhaps have an old radio

47:08.800 --> 47:10.799
like the one you have destroyed?

47:11.880 --> 47:13.279
I do.

47:35.560 --> 47:38.199
I'm looking out the window

47:38.280 --> 47:41.719
Tired and longing for storm

47:43.040 --> 47:46.439
The Sun is high, so high

47:47.760 --> 47:51.079
Shining into pilot's eye

47:51.800 --> 47:55.439
Warming tirelessly

47:57.640 --> 48:00.639
Cold, blue, great expanse

48:01.800 --> 48:05.279
I'm waiting for wind to scatter

48:06.480 --> 48:09.599
This dark and swirly matter

48:10.960 --> 48:13.999
I'll stand there as one

48:15.560 --> 48:18.119
Face to face with the Sun

48:19.920 --> 48:23.519
I'm waiting for wind to scatter

48:24.480 --> 48:27.839
This dark and swirly matter

48:28.920 --> 48:31.679
I'll stand there as one

48:33.480 --> 48:35.959
Face to face with the Sun

48:53.520 --> 48:55.519
It's not what I meant.

48:56.680 --> 48:59.319
I was thinking about something else.

49:00.640 --> 49:03.599
But I don't keep money at home.

49:08.280 --> 49:10.519
I'm not here,

49:11.080 --> 49:12.759
to steal from you

49:13.200 --> 49:14.879
or kill you.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.799
In that case,
I can't help you.

49:55.880 --> 49:57.359
You have a beautiful brooch, mam.

49:57.480 --> 49:58.479
Stop sucking up.

49:58.600 --> 50:00.479
We're here about the case 19...

50:03.160 --> 50:05.359
We're here about the case 1977

50:05.480 --> 50:08.879
#fugitives/2204

50:09.240 --> 50:12.799
My heart breaks when I see
an officer with potential like yours,

50:13.160 --> 50:15.559
who, instead of working
on priorities of our department...

50:15.920 --> 50:17.439
I don't even feel like finishing.

50:17.520 --> 50:18.719
That's a shame.

50:18.840 --> 50:19.719
I'd like to hear that

50:19.800 --> 50:20.999
All right, all right.

50:27.080 --> 50:30.359
I'm giving my permission
for your two-person squad

50:31.000 --> 50:32.799
to implement preventative actions

50:32.960 --> 50:36.119
and to move the surveillance
of the target into the field.

50:36.320 --> 50:37.919
Yes, sir.

50:47.840 --> 50:50.959
Tape A, recording three.

50:51.480 --> 50:52.919
Procedure:

50:54.520 --> 50:56.679
Lie down comfortably,

50:57.160 --> 50:58.719
relax,

50:59.600 --> 51:03.639
lie comfortably, loosely, calmly

51:03.800 --> 51:05.039
relax

51:07.680 --> 51:09.039
relax

51:11.600 --> 51:15.439
If the conjured image starts to blur,

51:16.080 --> 51:19.999
start again, calmly and patiently.

51:22.400 --> 51:24.999
Stay focused and present.

51:27.240 --> 51:29.399
A triangle with a circle.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.079
A triangle with a circle.

51:33.400 --> 51:36.359
The first experimental TV program.

51:38.120 --> 51:40.519
A triangle with a circle.

51:46.120 --> 51:48.519
A triangle with a circle.

51:51.040 --> 51:53.599
A triangle with a circle.

51:55.360 --> 51:57.999
A triangle with a circle.

52:00.120 --> 52:01.959
You lost it!

52:12.280 --> 52:14.319
Come by tonight.

52:15.840 --> 52:18.119
It seems I've discovered
something amazing.

52:18.200 --> 52:20.279
Share it online.

52:21.480 --> 52:23.319
Do you want to bang?

52:23.400 --> 52:25.079
Good, me too.

52:25.760 --> 52:29.839
But...
first take me on a real date

52:30.720 --> 52:32.959
with beer or something.

52:35.480 --> 52:36.439
Fine.

52:36.520 --> 52:38.319
Then we'll bang!

52:38.440 --> 52:40.479
But change the sheets.

52:44.280 --> 52:46.439
It suits you.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.079
You'll see...

52:55.720 --> 52:58.039
You have to get yourself in a trance.

52:58.400 --> 53:01.919
First you think it's a dream

53:03.240 --> 53:06.639
and then it's like you get this
strong impression, that...

53:07.160 --> 53:10.879
you see, hear and feel

53:13.640 --> 53:15.479
that you can touch things.

53:15.640 --> 53:18.199
Hey, this guy keeps looking at us.

53:22.640 --> 53:26.359
He's looking at you,
because you're exceptionally beautiful.

53:34.560 --> 53:36.159
Maybe.

53:37.720 --> 53:38.839
Continue.

53:38.960 --> 53:40.799
The most beautiful girl I've ever talked to.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.279
Not this,

53:43.040 --> 53:44.879
the one about the radio.

54:02.720 --> 54:04.319
It's here.

54:20.760 --> 54:21.839
Listen,

54:22.000 --> 54:25.159
if you try to do something
to me I don't want,

54:25.320 --> 54:27.919
I'll rip your dick off.

54:29.920 --> 54:31.239
Okay.

54:33.040 --> 54:35.399
And now kiss me

54:35.600 --> 54:38.239
just like they do it in the movies.

54:40.400 --> 54:41.639
Okay.

55:16.640 --> 55:21.999
[Better tomorrow was yesterday]

55:25.920 --> 55:27.759
They love it.

55:36.160 --> 55:38.799
Wait here,
when I say "come in"- come in.

55:38.960 --> 55:39.999
All right.

55:54.840 --> 55:56.439
Come in!

56:01.880 --> 56:03.959
Sit in the armchair.

56:21.160 --> 56:22.719
That's illegal.

56:24.400 --> 56:25.639
Whatever.

57:09.720 --> 57:11.119
Adaś...

57:13.240 --> 57:17.319
Everything's great and all,
but I didn't come here to watch TV.

58:19.320 --> 58:21.399
I think I love you.

58:29.920 --> 58:31.839
That's nice

58:39.240 --> 58:41.719
but you're not my type.

58:44.760 --> 58:47.039
I'm looking for someone...

58:47.600 --> 58:50.559
mature and responsible.

58:51.520 --> 58:54.239
Somebody to start a family.

58:54.880 --> 58:57.999
If I were unlucky enough
to get pregnant with you, I...

58:58.200 --> 59:00.719
would have to get rid of it.

59:04.080 --> 59:07.439
Anybody can see you're a freak.

59:14.720 --> 59:16.079
I'm not.

59:17.640 --> 59:19.079
Yes, you are.

59:24.080 --> 59:27.959
I must get going
or I'll miss the last subway.

59:35.160 --> 59:37.679
You don't want to stay the night?

59:46.160 --> 59:48.359
It's too intimate.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.599
Tape A, recording three

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.839
Procedure:

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.519
Lie down comfortably,

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.079
relax,

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:14.519
Lie comfortably, loosely, calmly.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.039
Relax.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.799
Loosely.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.919
...to the hospital.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.199
He's here!

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.719
He's here!

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.879
Siwicki, tell us where you were!

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.359
Take it easy,
take it easy, not so close.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.999
Gentlemen,

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:31.959
let's truly celebrate
the return of our friend.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.039
That's something!

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.119
That's a Nobel Prize,
that's a Nobel Prize, professor!

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.239
Professor, a shot?

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.199
Cheers!

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.199
Gentlemen!
Let your friend rest.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.599
Of course, of course.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.479
Take it easy, Krzyś.
Breath.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.119
Now.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.359
You're safe now.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.279
In my session,
I felt like there was no matter! Krzyś...

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.119
You were maybe two or three minutes.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.319
Time is not important.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.159
Coming back to the Gudriev's experiment,

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.679
I think we can't exclude

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:16.519
any of these options.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.279
But nobody is excluding any options.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.079
We won't agree
until Krzysztof says something.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.679
See, Urszulka?

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.199
Krzysio is back and he's fine.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.039
Let's go.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.079
We don't want you
to turn grey from the smoke.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.199
Out of body experience!

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.839
Cheers, Krzysiu!

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.799
Gentlemen...

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.599
Silence!

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.399
I don't know...

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.239
I dreamt about a bleak flat,

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.039
getting across the river.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:00.359
I saw my body from afar,

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.039
I could walk through
walls like a ghost.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:18.359
It was a dream, which...

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.159
I don't know if it really was a dream, or...

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.559
I don't know if this is not a dream.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.399
Hi, chubby.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.599
I'm on a break.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.199
I don't have to talk to you.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.199
I've noticed.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.079
Your day is one long break.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.479
Where's your buddy?

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.039
I don't know,
he's not here.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.359
I've noticed that, too.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.279
You're not curious
what happened to him?

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.479
No.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.959
You're not curious at all?

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.119
Not even a little.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.199
I thought you were buddies.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.079
Call him.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.159
Do you have any better ideas?

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.559
I can't help you, babe.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.399
Take this one, now!

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:14.839
Here.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.719
Thank you.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:26.439
What's your relation to the patient?

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.599
We're supposed to get married.
In the spring.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.719
Your fiancé is in a coma.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:40.119
His condition is not a result
of any physical trauma, like an accident.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.679
We don't really know what's wrong with him.
The CT didn't show anything.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.919
He can wake up tomorrow

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.559
or he can never wake up again.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.439
Can I see him now?

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:29.238
You should go now.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.118
Your friend is in good hands.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.319
He's been in better ones before.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.959
I don't doubt that.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:10.919
You have to tell me everything Adam told you,
do you understand?

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.359
No way.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.799
I promised to be discreet.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:24.879
Fine, it may not interest you,
but your buddy and my dear friend

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.839
is now lying like...
sea food,

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.119
like some sort
of steamed vegetable, get it?

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.399
I don't know.
Something happened to him.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.599
He's almost a dead man.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:37.119
And only you can help me,
but you have to be honest with me and tell me.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.719
Everything.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.399
But I know nothing.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.359
I just clean here.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.879
Just clean?

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.239
Who would keep such
a lazy bone like you?

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.319
Look around, the way you live.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.839
Where's your bed?

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:02.159
Don't take it personally,
but I'm not interested.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.359
You don't have one.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.959
Because you don't need it.

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.439
When was the last time you slept?

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.759
- What did you dream about?
- What did you dream about?

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.239
What did you dream about?

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.399
This visit is making me tired.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.839
What did you dream about?

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.359
This visit is making me tired,
you're making me tired.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.079
I make friends easily,

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:32.279
I know many secrets of this corporation.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.639
You're our first android, you fool.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.599
And not a good one at that.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.519
Fat, ugly, bald,
forty-year-old android!

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.399
Really, who would want such a fat android?

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.359
I guess they didn't have better embryos.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.679
Tell me, Bernie

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.199

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.759
You remember everything.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.359
No way, I promised to be discreet.
It's a matter of honor.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.839
Honorable robot?

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.919

Yes.

Don't know.

I'm no scientist.

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:14.559
I don't understand,

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.199
I asked about tea.

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.039
Fuck!

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.039
I'll bring some

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:24.239
tea and cookies.

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.639
We'll have a chat.

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.359
I'm 83 years

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.919
I've spent my whole life in this house

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.799
and now I'd like to...

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:49.239
move somewhere else.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.119
Help me.

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:06.199
My daddy,

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.719
professor engineer Emfazy Stefański,

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.359
was a genius.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.599
In those days,

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.439
just like today,

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.639
if you loved Poland

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.159
you could choose between

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.279
escaping through the Iron Curtain

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.359
or dying for the country.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:46.879
Father decided to use alpha
and theta waves to escape.

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:54.479
Together with his assistants
they spent days working on Polish Television,

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:58.199
and experimented at night.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:02.559
Krzysztof was my daddy's favorite assistant.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.999
In the fall of 1952

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.639
my Krzysztof,

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.799
and your Adam,

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:19.599
left his body for few hours.

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.679
He was unconscious

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:24.879
but he came back.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:31.959
But one day Krzyś didn't come back.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:24.279
I guess somebody really overdid it!

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.479
We're so sorry,
but Krzyś has to rest a little bit more.

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.359
Direction: bathroom.

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.759
Just a little bit more, Krzyś.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.559
Fuck, bravo, gentlemen.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:17.599
Do you recognize me?

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:35.759
And now?

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:39.279
Goria!

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.639
It's short for Phantasmagoria, right?

01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:44.359
Maybe.

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.879
Come back to me!

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.159
Wake up for me!

01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:53.639
I don't know how to explain,
I don't fully understand it myself.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.679
You don't have to explain anything.

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:57.919
I'm few steps ahead of you.

01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:00.599
XXI century says hello.

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:02.399
I don't understand.

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.999
You don't have to.

01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:06.799
Just come back to me.

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:09.079
I don't want to be alone anymore.

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.159
Wake up for me.

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.959
Krzysiu!

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.559
Why are you sitting in the dark?

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:18.479
Oh, excuse moi!

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.519
My apologies

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:21.799
Heniu,

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:24.359
get the professor to the kitchen.

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:28.759
It looks like your experiment works.

01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:30.679
And in both ways.

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.799
Remember, you were unconscious
for a long time.

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:37.159
I just came to get a sip of water.

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:50.119
Ask her.

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:52.639
Try not to scare her off.

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.439
Krzysiu!

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.759
Agent Jan Targosz,
National Security Bureau.

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.599
Warsaw 2030.

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:10.439
Welcome to the future.

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:19.159
We have to explain in the simplest way
for you to understand

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:21.199
who you are,
but you won't know who you were.

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:23.599
The government removed
your memory to restore you to society,

01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:25.039
without taking away your physical life.

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:26.039
Life.

01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:30.079
You lost your old identity,

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.959
but you gained a new, better life.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.439
Of course, we'll provide you with
a good job, appreciate it.

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:37.279
And we promise the government
won't bother you anymore.

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:40.839
We thank you for your sacrifice
for the betterment of our reborn

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.439
independent

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.319
country.

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:46.039
We wish you all the best
in your future endeavors.

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.719
Where is he?

01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:56.959
Where is he?

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:01.279
How incompetent, fix her.
