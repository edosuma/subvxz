00:20.311 --> 00:23.148
<i> Let me tell you</i>
<i>the tale of Jimmy Stubbins</i>

00:23.231 --> 00:25.358
<i>and the golden jingle bells.</i>

00:27.402 --> 00:32.365
<i>It all began 100 years ago</i>
<i>when the small town of</i>
<i>Pleasant Bay</i>

00:32.449 --> 00:34.701
<i>fell on hard times.</i>

00:34.784 --> 00:37.829
<i>A drought caused</i>
<i>the local river to run dry,</i>

00:37.912 --> 00:39.581
<i>which shut down</i>
<i>the lumber mill,</i>

00:39.664 --> 00:42.500
<i>putting most of the townsfolk</i>
<i>out of work.</i>

00:43.877 --> 00:46.963
<i>Spirits were down</i>
<i>that Christmas Eve.</i>

00:47.046 --> 00:49.424
<i>Kids like Jimmy Stubbins</i>
<i>went to sleep</i>

00:49.507 --> 00:52.010
<i>with little hope</i>
<i>of getting any presents.</i>

01:24.125 --> 01:25.919
<i>Through his sleepy eyes,</i>

01:26.002 --> 01:29.756
<i>he saw something</i>
<i>that had dropped from the sky.</i>

01:37.597 --> 01:40.934
<i>Golden jingle bells</i>
<i>from Santa's sleigh.</i>

01:46.356 --> 01:50.193
<i>As Jimmy took the bells</i>
<i>in his hands</i>
<i>and felt their magic,</i>

01:50.276 --> 01:54.739
<i>he wished with all his heart</i>
<i>for the mill to reopen</i>

01:54.823 --> 01:57.367
<i>so the town could get back</i>
<i>on its feet.</i>

02:00.453 --> 02:03.039
<i>When he awoke</i>
<i>on Christmas morning,</i>

02:03.122 --> 02:06.042
<i>there he saw</i>
<i>a present under the tree.</i>

02:10.964 --> 02:12.757
<i>And, to his delight,</i>

02:12.841 --> 02:16.177
<i>the strip of jingle bells</i>
<i>still lay by his bedside.</i>

02:16.261 --> 02:17.554
Mom, Dad, come quick.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.472
<i> It wasn't a dream.</i>

02:25.395 --> 02:27.814
Look. Merry Christmas.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.733
Shane, Judy.
Are you awake?

02:30.817 --> 02:33.194
<i> A neighbor</i>
<i>appeared at their door...</i>

02:33.278 --> 02:34.946
Have you heard?

02:35.029 --> 02:37.115
<i> The river was flowing,</i>
<i>and the mill was reopening.</i>

02:37.198 --> 02:40.869
<i>The townsfolk were</i>
<i>all getting their jobs back.</i>

02:40.952 --> 02:42.912
<i>Jimmy knew his wish</i>
<i>had been granted.</i>

02:42.996 --> 02:47.250
My wish came true.
These bells must be magical!

02:47.333 --> 02:49.002
Wh... what are these bells?

02:49.085 --> 02:52.255
I was sleeping,
and then I heard Santa
on the roof,

02:52.338 --> 02:54.841
and then his sleigh was flying
away, and then his reindeer...

02:54.924 --> 02:58.928
<i> The story of</i>
<i>the golden jingle bells</i>
<i>spread quickly.</i>

02:59.012 --> 03:01.556
<i>The bells were put on display</i>
<i>at the lumber mill</i>

03:01.639 --> 03:04.058
<i>and became the town's</i>
<i>good luck charm.</i>

03:08.229 --> 03:11.316
<i>People started coming</i>
<i>to Pleasant Bay</i>
<i>from miles around</i>

03:11.399 --> 03:14.777
<i>to see the bells and deliver</i>
<i>their own Christmas wishes.</i>

03:18.448 --> 03:22.619
<i>The bells became</i>
<i>a symbol of hope</i>
<i>for all who came to see them.</i>

03:22.702 --> 03:25.788
<i>They were soon given a home</i>
<i>in the town's museum,</i>

03:25.872 --> 03:28.207
<i>and every year</i>
<i>on Christmas Eve,</i>

03:28.291 --> 03:30.668
<i>the town held a</i>
<i>Ringing of the Bells ceremony.</i>

03:30.752 --> 03:33.087
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!

03:33.171 --> 03:37.800
<i> As more and more people</i>
<i>came to see the bells</i>
<i>and make their wishes...</i>

03:37.884 --> 03:41.346
<i>Pleasant Bay and its people</i>
<i>began to flourish.</i>

03:42.555 --> 03:44.140
And since that Christmas,

03:44.223 --> 03:49.979
Pleasant Bay has had 100 years
of prosperity and peace.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.899
Some people say
it's just coincidence,

03:52.982 --> 03:59.322
but true believers know
it's all because
of the golden jingle bells.

04:00.907 --> 04:01.950
Fiona!

04:04.410 --> 04:07.288
There's customers waiting
for you at the gift shop.

04:07.372 --> 04:10.667
I'm sorry, Mr. Martin. I...
I just love telling the story
of the bells.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.293
I can take it from here.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.549
This year marks

04:18.633 --> 04:23.930
the 100th anniversary
of Jimmy Stubbins
finding the bells.

04:24.013 --> 04:27.350
So, this should be the biggest
Ringing of the Bells ever!

04:27.433 --> 04:28.977
That's why people
come to our town,

04:29.060 --> 04:33.022
to see the bells
and to make
their Christmas wish.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.817
Okay, are there any questions?

04:35.900 --> 04:37.735
Yes, Violet,
what's your question?

04:37.819 --> 04:40.488
How can Santa's sleigh
still fly when
he's missing the bells?

04:40.571 --> 04:43.950
I'm sure Santa
has plenty of other bells.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.952
Does he know
these bells are here?

04:46.035 --> 04:48.079
Yes, he does.
And he's very happy about it.

04:48.162 --> 04:52.500
These bells have brought
so much good fortune
to Pleasant Bay.

04:52.583 --> 04:56.713
How can those be Santa's bells
when there's no such thing
as Santa?

04:56.796 --> 04:59.882
Reggie, of course
there's really a Santa.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.884
Right, Mr. Martin?

05:01.968 --> 05:03.344
Absolutely, young lady.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.221
-See?
-Naughty list.

05:05.304 --> 05:08.474
There will always be
non-believers.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.269
But don't let them rob you
of your Christmas spirit.

05:11.352 --> 05:15.565
Christmas is a time of goodwill
towards all men,

05:15.648 --> 05:19.402
and women, people, in general.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.488
Good tidings to all the people.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.241
All right, kids,
feel free to look around
the rest of the museum.

05:25.324 --> 05:27.702
-Let's go look
at the old fire truck.
-Let's go over there.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.254
What do you think that was for?

05:38.337 --> 05:40.214
Probably for reaching
into your butt.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.340
Kenny.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.217
Where did I...

05:43.301 --> 05:44.802
Are you okay, Mr. Martin?

05:44.886 --> 05:48.639
Uh... Yeah, uh, just seem to
have misplaced my glasses.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.559
You put 'em in your coat pocket
when you were yelling at Fiona.

05:51.642 --> 05:52.977
Yelling?

05:53.061 --> 05:56.939
You mean,
passion, maybe, but not... No.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.733
I never put my gla... Oh...

05:58.816 --> 06:00.276
Hey...

06:00.359 --> 06:01.611
Hey now.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.196
Thank you, Violet.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.949
Hey, what are
you kids doing?

06:07.033 --> 06:08.993
-Dad!
-Hey, buddy.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.454
-Hi, Mr. Bottoms.
-Hey, Violet. How are ya?

06:11.537 --> 06:14.040
You guys enjoying your visit?

06:14.123 --> 06:16.709
Listen, I was thinkin'
since you don't have
school tomorrow,

06:16.793 --> 06:18.461
why don't we make it
a boys' night tonight?

06:18.544 --> 06:21.297
Oh! Can we make popcorn
and watch<i> The Batman?</i>

06:21.380 --> 06:25.510
Uh, I was thinking of something
a little more Christmassy.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.012
Uh... how about<i> Elf?</i>

06:28.096 --> 06:29.972
I love it when he eats
his spaghetti with syrup.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.517
-It's so gross!
-That is so funny.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.185
Hey, I was looking at that.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.311
Hey!

06:35.394 --> 06:37.105
Reggie, give it back.
Come on.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.648
You want it?
Come, get it.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.316
-Hey, be... be careful.
-Quit being a jerk.

06:40.399 --> 06:42.151
-Boys, stop that.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.861
-Whoa...

07:01.921 --> 07:03.673
Oh, my God,
did you see that?

07:03.756 --> 07:05.007
It almost fell on his head.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.717
You all right?

07:11.222 --> 07:15.184
Everything's fine.
No one's hurt. Right?

07:15.268 --> 07:17.603
Yes. Thank you.

07:19.772 --> 07:23.901
Did, uh... did that happen
because I didn't
believe in Santa?

07:23.985 --> 07:26.529
Lucky for you, I do.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.364
Okay, 20 more minutes, kids,

07:28.447 --> 07:31.284
then the bus will be taking you
back to school.

07:31.367 --> 07:32.869
Thank God.

07:39.333 --> 07:42.420
Pumpkin pie's for Thanksgiving.
Pecan pie is for Christmas.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.255
Pumpkin pie is for both.

07:44.338 --> 07:47.216
It doesn't make any sense.
The same pie shouldn't
get two holidays.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.801
Oh, wanna go sledding
over break?

07:48.885 --> 07:50.386
Do you even have to ask?

07:50.469 --> 07:51.762
My dad said that
there's snow up
on Table Mountain.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.097
Maybe he could take us one day.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.265
Kenny!

07:57.018 --> 07:59.437
Come on. Mom said
I have to walk you home today.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.397
I can walk with Violet.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.108
No, sorry.
I'm going to the station.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.027
Hey, Harrison.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.239
Uh, any plans for the break?

08:11.532 --> 08:12.575
Not really.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.036
Yeah, me neither.

08:15.119 --> 08:18.623
Um, I'll probably just
be hanging out at home.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.840
Okay, um, good...
good talk.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.300
Violet, come on, let's go.

08:29.383 --> 08:32.303
-See you later, skater.
-Catch you soon, baboon.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.263
You wanna hear
about our science project?

08:34.347 --> 08:35.681
We're gonna get up
early tomorrow

08:35.765 --> 08:37.850
and walk all over town
and look for leaves.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.317
Why am I going
to the station today,

08:46.400 --> 08:49.237
and what are you doing
that's so important?

08:49.320 --> 08:50.529
It's none of your business.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.374
You're going to Patty's house

09:01.457 --> 09:04.085
to work on the Student Council
Santagram fundraiser.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.545
What?

09:06.629 --> 09:08.381
You have art supplies
sticking out
of your backpack,

09:08.464 --> 09:11.175
and you put on lip gloss
in case Patty's brother
is there.

09:13.302 --> 09:16.555
Why can't you just act like
a normal 11-year-old?

09:19.308 --> 09:21.269
Have fun at Patty's!

09:24.313 --> 09:25.106
Hi, Sam.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.274
Hey, Violet.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.445
Hey, Deputy Terry.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.781
Deputy Violet in da house.

09:33.864 --> 09:36.158
-Ooh! Can I have one of these?
-Yeah.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.369
Uh-uh! Not before dinner.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.663
Oh, bummer.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.665
Pleasant Bay
Sheriff's office.
How can I help you?

09:57.513 --> 09:58.931
Thank you.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.189
Hey, you.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.357
Hi, Dad.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.359
Oh, what you got there?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.986
Science project
for winter break.

10:12.069 --> 10:14.488
We're learning all about
the flora in Pleasant Bay.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.365
Hmm.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.577
We gotta find as many leaves
as possible.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.288
Well, that sounds intriguing.

10:22.371 --> 10:25.458
Oh, hey. Guess what?
We had a 10-90 today.

10:25.541 --> 10:26.542
A 10-90?

10:26.625 --> 10:27.793
-A bank alarm?
-Mmm-hmm.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.712
Someone robbed a bank
in Pleasant Bay?

10:29.795 --> 10:31.797
No, no, no.
It's just a wiring glitch.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.507
False alarm.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.886
Oh, man. Nothing exciting
ever happens around here.

10:36.969 --> 10:41.223
Hey, that's exactly
the way we like it.
Isn't that right, Terry?

10:41.307 --> 10:42.850
That's right, Sheriff.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.572
Okay, coming at ya
fresh out the oven.

10:56.655 --> 10:58.991
Ooh! Smells good, Mom.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.952
Go ahead and dig in.
I have to get to work.

11:03.579 --> 11:04.580
Not at the table.

11:04.663 --> 11:06.248
Aren't we waiting for Dad?

11:06.332 --> 11:08.167
I'm starving.
Can we just start?

11:08.250 --> 11:09.460
We can do both.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.797
You should have seen Dad
at the museum today.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.590
He was all, like, flying ninja.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.092
He saved a boy's life today.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.803
Even though it was Reggie,
who is kind of a jerk.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.679
Oh, wow,
I would like to see that.

11:20.763 --> 11:21.764
All in a day's work.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.851
The car took three tries
to start last night.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.145
Okay.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.815
I'm picking up
some extra shifts
at the school over break

11:30.898 --> 11:32.775
so I can use that money
to pay for the car.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.443
Okay.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.028
I gotta get going.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.906
Well, we are set
because we are having...

11:38.989 --> 11:41.575
...boys night.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.327
You wanna watch<i> Elf</i>
with us tonight, Harrison?

11:43.411 --> 11:45.162
I'm going to Doug's
after dinner.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.831
He's too cool for us.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.292
Hey, did you know
they are doing some

11:50.376 --> 11:52.211
basketball tournaments
at the school over break?

11:52.294 --> 11:53.504
We should check out
a game, huh?

11:53.587 --> 11:55.381
We should?

11:55.464 --> 11:56.966
You know, I was
a basketball coach here
before I moved to Portland

11:57.049 --> 11:59.093
and met your mom,
and fell madly in love.

11:59.176 --> 12:00.344
Yeah, we know.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.595
We do?

12:01.679 --> 12:03.806
State champs one year
or something.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.434
Well, regional champs,
but still...

12:06.517 --> 12:07.560
it was a big deal back then.

12:07.643 --> 12:08.978
That's cool.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.813
Well, don't keep this one up
too late...

12:10.896 --> 12:13.482
-I won't.
-...Regional champ.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.234
-Love you.
-Love you, Mom.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.028
-Salad?
-Nope.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.074
Someone's an angry elf.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.287
You are.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.078
Dad?

13:19.798 --> 13:20.883
Where's Dad?

13:20.966 --> 13:22.801
He got a call. He had to go in.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.262
I made you some extra eggs,
if you want some.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.641
I really
need to teach you
how to make coffee.

13:28.724 --> 13:31.352
You should always
start your day
with a healthy breakfast.

13:31.435 --> 13:34.188
And you should always start
your day leaving me alone.

13:36.690 --> 13:37.733
That's Kenny.

13:37.816 --> 13:39.235
We have
a science project to do.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.654
On the first day of break?

13:44.031 --> 13:45.407
Hey, you want some eggs?

13:45.491 --> 13:46.492
Sure.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.705
Oh!

13:53.207 --> 13:54.708
Do we have this one yet?

13:54.792 --> 13:56.919
Nope.
That's an<i> Acer macrophyllum.</i>

13:57.002 --> 13:58.963
-A what?
-A Bigleaf Maple.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.548
Good find.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.049
You're a great partner.

14:02.132 --> 14:03.676
We should ride our bikes
to Rec Park.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.679
They planted Pacific Dogwoods
back in 19...

14:10.849 --> 14:12.851
Why is my dad at the museum?

14:49.555 --> 14:51.557
No sign of forced entry?

14:51.640 --> 14:52.641
Nothing.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.643
They must've had a key.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.895
What about the alarm system
and the cameras?

14:56.979 --> 14:59.648
It's all wired
to the main circuit.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.442
Somebody cut the power.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.736
They must have known
where the circuit breaker was.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.029
And where is that?

15:05.112 --> 15:07.197
It's outside, in the back,
by the meter.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.325
They would have to have a key
for that, too.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.868
Hey, Sam,
check the circuit breaker.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.662
See if it was forced open,
and dust for prints.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.830
Roger that.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.336
This way.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.174
Sorry, kids,
we're closed today.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.217
Hey, you two
shouldn't be in here.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.013
Violet.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.765
Dad, what's going on?

15:32.848 --> 15:34.642
Somebody stole the bells.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.522
I thought you secured the door.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.358
-Sorry, boss.
-Yeah, put some tape outside.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.485
We don't need anybody else
wandering in here.

15:44.568 --> 15:45.986
On it.

15:50.949 --> 15:52.201
Dad, stop.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.703
What in the world happened here
last night?

15:54.787 --> 15:57.289
No, Mayor Donovan,
you can't walk around in here.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.749
This is an active crime scene.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.876
So it's true,
the bells are gone.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.421
Uh, yeah. It would seem so.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.215
The Ringing of the Bells
is in three days.

16:06.298 --> 16:09.510
You can't have
a Ringing of the Bells
with no bells.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.428
It's right in the name.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.389
We're gonna do everything
we can to find the bells
as quickly as possible.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.433
Yeah, and just before
the election. Great.

16:16.517 --> 16:21.271
My last accomplishment
in the office will be losing
the town's pride and joy.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.148
No one's gonna blame you, Dad.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.275
How could you let this happen?

16:25.359 --> 16:26.819
-Dad.
-Guys,

16:26.902 --> 16:29.279
we really need to get back
to work. So, Deputy Terry,

16:29.363 --> 16:31.990
could you please help
the Mayor delicately
out of our crime scene?

16:32.074 --> 16:33.367
Yeah. Come on, Dad.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.619
Yeah, maybe my last
accomplishment in office

16:35.703 --> 16:38.622
should be appointing
a new sheriff.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.795
Three days before Christmas.
I can't believe it.

16:44.878 --> 16:49.007
Don't worry, Dad.
The sheriff,
he's got it handled.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.718
You two need to go.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.469
-But, Dad...
-I can't give you guys
special treatment.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.596
Not with the Mayor
breathing down my neck.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.764
Okay.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.936
The circuit breaker
wasn't forced open.

17:01.019 --> 17:03.480
They must have had
a key to that, too.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.651
Who has a key besides you?

17:07.735 --> 17:09.236
Just one other person.

17:11.029 --> 17:12.740
Your next-door neighbor.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.541
Hey, George.

17:22.624 --> 17:23.917
Hey, Grant.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.461
Terry, Sam.

17:25.544 --> 17:26.378
George.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.921
What's going on?

17:29.256 --> 17:31.842
Look, you mind if we ask you
a few questions?

17:33.427 --> 17:35.095
Yeah. Yeah, sure. No problem.

17:35.929 --> 17:36.972
Come on in.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.770
Hey, uh... do me a favor.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.647
Check my security camera
footage from last night.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.107
Might have caught something.

17:56.074 --> 17:57.534
What is going on?

17:59.411 --> 18:01.830
I think Mr. Bottoms
is in trouble.

18:03.415 --> 18:07.002
So, what time did you leave
the museum?

18:07.086 --> 18:10.672
Glenn and I both left
about 6:45 or so.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.174
And where'd you go?

18:12.257 --> 18:13.675
Here. Home.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.970
Harrison and Kenny
and I had dinner. Boys night.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.472
Oh. Not Margaret?

18:18.555 --> 18:21.058
No. She had picked up
a swing shift at the diner.

18:21.141 --> 18:24.478
She didn't get back
till after 2:00.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.855
And did you stay here all night
after that?

18:26.939 --> 18:28.315
Yeah, I did.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.237
You have your museum keys
on you?

18:33.320 --> 18:36.406
Yeah. Right there
on the counter.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.411
What about the high school?

18:41.495 --> 18:43.247
You still picking up
custodial shifts there?

18:43.330 --> 18:46.333
-Yeah. Mostly on the weekends.
-Sheriff.

18:46.416 --> 18:47.918
I have something
you need to see.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.507
This is the video feed
from your site security camera
last night.

18:53.590 --> 18:54.800
1:12 a.m.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.014
You mind if the deputies
look around a little bit?

19:02.307 --> 19:04.184
Um, no.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.602
Is your garage locked?

19:06.895 --> 19:08.188
Side door's open.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.950
What are you looking for,
Grant?

19:20.033 --> 19:21.451
The bells, George.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.579
Somebody stole 'em last night.

19:23.662 --> 19:24.538
What?

19:26.665 --> 19:28.125
And you think they're here?

19:36.842 --> 19:38.343
I'll check this side.

19:47.477 --> 19:48.979
What's going on?

19:49.062 --> 19:50.606
I think they're in the garage.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.774
Why are they in the garage?

19:52.858 --> 19:56.194
There's nothing in there.
It's just my grandma's
old stuff.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.620
Terry, over here.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.926
This is 'cause of
my previous arrest, isn't it?

20:19.009 --> 20:22.262
Well, it was for theft,
wasn't it?

20:22.346 --> 20:25.849
I got in with the wrong people.
I made a mistake. Okay?

20:25.933 --> 20:27.476
What's going on?

20:27.559 --> 20:30.187
Nothin', Harrison.
Just go back to your room.

20:32.105 --> 20:33.357
Dad, what did you do?

20:33.440 --> 20:35.192
I didn't...
I didn't do anything. Okay?

20:35.275 --> 20:37.569
Just, please go back
to your room.

20:38.737 --> 20:39.696
Sheriff?

20:41.365 --> 20:43.784
Found this tucked between
a few boxes in the garage.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.495
What... How did...
I don't know how that got here.

20:49.915 --> 20:53.168
You gotta believe me,
I have no idea
how that got in my garage.

20:53.251 --> 20:54.711
Where are the bells, George?

20:54.795 --> 20:58.006
I don't know! I told you.
Grant, come on, listen to me.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.675
Why would I steal the bells?

20:59.758 --> 21:01.093
You know me.

21:01.176 --> 21:02.469
George Bottoms...

21:02.552 --> 21:03.387
-Wait a minute. Guys...
-...you're under arrest.

21:03.470 --> 21:04.388
I swear.

21:09.559 --> 21:10.477
Dad?

21:11.603 --> 21:12.938
Hey, it's okay, buddy.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.773
It's just a misunderstanding,
is all.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.066
It's gonna be fine.

21:18.485 --> 21:21.196
-Kenny, no.
-Let go of me!

21:22.781 --> 21:24.116
Kenny, wait! No.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.785
Why are they
taking Dad away?

21:26.868 --> 21:29.037
Because he hasn't changed.
Okay?

21:33.333 --> 21:34.960
Let me know
if you find anything.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.086
You got it.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.550
We can't go in the house
while they search it.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.010
I called Mom at the diner.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.095
She's gonna come get us
to go to the station.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.847
Why don't you just have her
meet you there?

21:46.930 --> 21:48.015
I can drive you guys.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.018
Okay. Thank you.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.728
Yeah. Let me get my keys.

21:53.812 --> 21:54.938
Let's go.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.408
Here.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.660
Yeah, that's...
pretty hard evidence.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.495
-Dad.

22:10.579 --> 22:14.041
Hey. Hey, buddy.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.084
Dad, no. Not Mr. Bottoms.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.502
What are you guys doing here?

22:17.586 --> 22:19.379
We gave Harrison and Kenny
a ride.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.757
Oh.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.051
Your father didn't do this.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.886
How do you know that?

22:25.969 --> 22:26.845
Hey.

22:26.928 --> 22:28.764
I did not take those bells.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.101
Someone sure is trying
to make it look like I did.

22:34.603 --> 22:35.896
Harrison...

22:36.855 --> 22:38.565
you gotta trust me.

22:39.649 --> 22:41.109
Yeah, right.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.237
Let him go.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.406
I know this is hard on him.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.658
This is hard on all of us.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.080
Harrison.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.208
I believe you, Dad.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.174
What's that?

23:08.345 --> 23:10.514
It's not good for Mr. Bottoms.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.021
Sorry, Kenny.

23:19.397 --> 23:20.440
George.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.197
Come on.

23:28.532 --> 23:29.658
Listen to me.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.245
It's gonna be okay.

23:33.328 --> 23:36.289
I'm gonna figure out
a way outta this.

23:36.373 --> 23:39.501
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you too, kiddo.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.002
Come on, George.
It's time.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.393
Look, I'm sorry, George.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.395
I have to follow the evidence.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.862
Another Christmas
without my dad.

24:06.945 --> 24:12.325
I know what it's like to have
Christmas without one of
your parents. It sucks.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.455
My dad didn't do this, Violet.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.791
You are the smartest person
I know.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.459
You have to help us.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.554
-'Night, guys.
-All right, good night.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.598
There we go.

24:34.681 --> 24:37.142
-Dad?
-Yeah?

24:37.225 --> 24:39.102
I have a Christmas wish.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.771
Oh, yeah? What is it?

24:41.855 --> 24:45.650
I want Mr. Bottoms
to be home with Kenny
for Christmas morning.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.569
Oh, Violet...

24:47.652 --> 24:50.405
I don't think Santa
can help with this.

24:50.488 --> 24:52.908
If the bells
are really magical,

24:52.991 --> 24:54.117
then it'll happen.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.787
You know,
I wish it were that simple.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.543
Sheriff Pierce signing off.

25:03.627 --> 25:06.171
Deputy Violet signing off.

25:06.254 --> 25:07.464
I love you.

25:07.547 --> 25:08.924
Love you, too.

25:11.551 --> 25:12.594
Dad?

25:12.677 --> 25:13.929
Yeah?

25:14.012 --> 25:16.848
Did you find the bells
at the Bottoms house?

25:16.932 --> 25:20.310
No. No, we searched everywhere
and...

25:20.393 --> 25:22.229
they weren't there.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.731
Doesn't it seem weird
that the case would be
at the Bottoms house,

25:24.814 --> 25:26.024
but not the bells?

25:27.609 --> 25:31.112
Yeah, but maybe he already
did something with them.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.991
Then why would
he keep evidence that would
make him look guilty?

25:37.702 --> 25:40.330
I don't know.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.707
I want to help.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.210
With what? Mr. Bottoms' case?

25:45.293 --> 25:47.295
I can do something.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.464
I don't want to just sit around
and wait for someone
to solve the problem.

25:49.548 --> 25:54.135
Well, that someone would be me
because that is my job.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.137
You think it was Mr. Bottoms,

25:56.221 --> 25:58.848
but I don't believe
that he would do this.

26:01.851 --> 26:04.020
I know that he's Kenny's dad,

26:04.104 --> 26:09.651
but sometimes money makes
good people do bad things.

26:09.734 --> 26:12.195
Those bells are valuable.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.447
Just get some rest, okay?

26:48.023 --> 26:48.982
Got any eggs?

26:49.065 --> 26:50.525
Get in here.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.780
Means. Motive.
Opportunity.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.534
And what is that?

26:59.617 --> 27:01.578
This is what my dad
does at work.

27:01.661 --> 27:04.205
He makes a board for a case
and then puts pictures on it
and things.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.042
It's how he decides
on possible suspects.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.085
So, for your dad...

27:09.169 --> 27:11.379
Means. He had keys.

27:11.963 --> 27:12.881
Motive.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.841
The bells are worth money.

27:14.924 --> 27:16.551
Opportunity.

27:16.634 --> 27:18.595
His only alibi is that
he was home
sleeping last night.

27:18.678 --> 27:21.473
He could have
snuck out of the house
while you guys were asleep.

27:23.391 --> 27:25.310
How do you know
how to do all this?

27:25.393 --> 27:28.646
I've learned a lot
sitting at the police station
doing my homework.

27:31.983 --> 27:33.610
What can we do?

27:33.693 --> 27:36.738
We have to find another person
who has all three
of these things.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.157
Then we'll have
another suspect.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.035
Well, who else
could be a suspect?

27:42.118 --> 27:43.745
I have one idea.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.830
Are we gonna need
detective stuff?

28:12.357 --> 28:14.359
I think it's closed.

28:14.442 --> 28:16.444
Mr. Martin's car is here.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.462
Sure is quiet in here.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.880
Let's check it out.

28:42.470 --> 28:43.555
Wait for me.

28:45.723 --> 28:49.644
He's probably in his office.
Wait here. I'll be right back.

29:09.330 --> 29:10.331
Hmm.

29:13.418 --> 29:14.502
Mr. Martin?

29:14.586 --> 29:16.546
I'm sorry.
We were closed today.

29:16.629 --> 29:18.882
I just wanted to ask you
a couple of questions.

29:21.217 --> 29:22.177
Okay.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.388
I only have a moment.

29:28.641 --> 29:31.561
Why do you think Mr. Bottoms
would have stolen the bells?

29:31.644 --> 29:34.355
Oh, I'm still hoping
it wasn't him.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.691
He has been
a wonderful addition
to the staff this year.

29:36.774 --> 29:39.777
But it would probably be
for the money, right?

29:39.861 --> 29:41.529
It usually is. Yes.

29:43.781 --> 29:46.117
What is the museum's
donation money used for?

29:46.201 --> 29:48.786
Just, general upkeep
of the museum, mostly.

29:48.870 --> 29:52.790
Old buildings like these,
they're full of surprises.

29:52.874 --> 29:55.251
If Mr. Bottoms was stealing
the bells for money,

29:55.335 --> 29:57.879
why wouldn't he take
the donation money, too?

30:08.848 --> 30:12.644
Ah. I really have to take this,
and then I have to lock up.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.896
So, bye, Violet. Sorry.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.649
Hi.

30:17.732 --> 30:18.775
Hold on just a...

30:20.360 --> 30:22.320
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Martin.

30:22.403 --> 30:23.488
Bye, bye now.

30:23.571 --> 30:25.114
Hello?

30:25.198 --> 30:26.199
Yes.

30:35.416 --> 30:36.793
Hey.

30:36.876 --> 30:39.504
I handled the shoplifting call
at the M and M market.

30:40.463 --> 30:41.965
Where's Sam?

30:42.048 --> 30:46.010
Oh, she's out looking into
who vandalized Carl's garage.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.762
What do you think's going on,
Sheriff?

30:47.845 --> 30:49.889
I've never seen
so much crime here before.

30:49.973 --> 30:53.017
I know the town needs
its Christmas spirit back.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.936
We need to find these bells.

30:55.019 --> 30:57.855
What's the latest
on the pawn shops
and the jewelry stores?

30:58.565 --> 30:59.607
No hits yet.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.109
All right, well, stay on it.

31:01.192 --> 31:03.903
Go into overtime
if you have to.
Sam as well.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.446
Uh, my Dad...

31:05.530 --> 31:09.242
Uh, Mayor Donovan wants to hold
a press conference today.

31:09.325 --> 31:11.119
About the bells. At noon.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.121
I can run point
for the department.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.873
No, no, I have to be there.
This is too important

31:15.957 --> 31:18.334
for your dad and the town.

31:18.418 --> 31:21.045
Yes, sir. I understand.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.090
Why don't you come, too?

31:34.976 --> 31:36.561
Means.

31:36.644 --> 31:39.439
Who else has a key
to the museum?
Mr. Martin, obviously.

31:39.522 --> 31:42.066
And he was acting
kind of funny.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.484
What's the second "M" again?

31:43.568 --> 31:45.320
Motive. Most likely money.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.780
Sometimes money makes
good people do bad things.

31:47.864 --> 31:48.990
Why does he need money?

31:49.073 --> 31:50.783
That's what we need
to find out.

31:58.374 --> 32:01.836
I counted the money.
It's a good haul.

32:01.919 --> 32:03.212
Oh, you don't need
to do that.

32:03.296 --> 32:05.923
I can meet you somewhere
about halfway.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.091
How about the pier?

32:07.925 --> 32:09.844
I'm on my way, okay?

32:09.927 --> 32:12.096
He's going to the pier.
We gotta beat him there.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.514
How are we gonna do that?

32:13.598 --> 32:15.183
He's got a dozen stoplights
to get through.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.727
If we take the footbridge,
we can get there first.

32:20.647 --> 32:21.898
-Come on, Kenny!

32:25.151 --> 32:26.277
Whoa!

32:30.448 --> 32:31.866
Slow down!

32:36.954 --> 32:38.581
This way, Kenny.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.375
Look both ways!

32:42.377 --> 32:43.711
Not the stairs.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.962
You got this!

32:57.141 --> 32:58.559
There's his car.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.330
We're almost there.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.712
Pedestrians ahead!

33:26.504 --> 33:28.756
-Whoops!

33:28.840 --> 33:30.591
Hey! Watch out!

33:30.675 --> 33:31.718
Sorry!

33:31.801 --> 33:33.302
Merry Christmas!

33:55.283 --> 33:56.701
Barbara.

33:58.244 --> 33:59.954
How are you?

34:00.913 --> 34:02.248
That's not Mrs. Martin.

34:02.331 --> 34:04.000
-Well, guess what?
-What?

34:04.083 --> 34:05.835
We did really well this year.

34:05.918 --> 34:07.712
Yeah, the donations
were through the roof.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.638
What's that?

34:17.722 --> 34:20.057
It's the museum's
donation money.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.115
Well, now
we're never gonna know
where the money's gone.

34:41.662 --> 34:44.832
We can use the police computers
to look up her license plate.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.375
That doesn't sound legal.

34:46.459 --> 34:48.878
That's why we're not
going to tell anybody.

35:04.644 --> 35:05.478
Mayor.

35:05.561 --> 35:07.188
Where is the bell?

35:07.271 --> 35:09.315
-Guys, guys, guys, please.
Please, I...
-Mayor!

35:09.398 --> 35:11.776
There's never been
this many reporters before.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.861
-Mayor!
-Hold on a second, please.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.322
I can't hear
the lady's question.
Yes, ma'am?

35:16.405 --> 35:19.283
Are you going to cancel
the Ringing of the Bells
celebration?

35:19.367 --> 35:20.868
Absolutely not!

35:20.952 --> 35:22.829
The great town of Pleasant Bay

35:22.912 --> 35:25.790
represents the joy and spirit
of Christmas.

35:25.873 --> 35:27.041
Not without the bells.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.376
Yeah!

35:28.459 --> 35:30.294
That's the whole reason
everyone comes.

35:30.378 --> 35:33.047
-Yes, I...
-If no one's here
on Christmas Eve,

35:33.130 --> 35:35.216
my bakery's out a lot of money.

35:35.299 --> 35:37.051
Yes, I understand.

35:37.134 --> 35:41.597
I've had 15 cancellations
at my hotel
in the last 24 hours, Mayor.

35:41.681 --> 35:44.141
The bells are
the key to everything.

35:45.184 --> 35:47.895
Yes, yes.
Friends, friends.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.648
Keep that Pleasant Bay
spirit up.

35:50.731 --> 35:53.067
Stay hopeful,
because in this town

35:53.150 --> 35:55.820
we believe in Christmas spirit,
don't we?

35:55.903 --> 35:57.280
-And we believe... Yes!

35:57.363 --> 35:58.739
And we believe in the bells.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.575
This is great publicity
for the mayor.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.618
This is horrible publicity
for the mayor.

36:02.702 --> 36:05.413
But not if the bells are found
before Christmas Eve.

36:05.496 --> 36:08.249
Then he would be a hero,
and get a lot of attention.

36:08.332 --> 36:09.792
And with the election
coming up...

36:10.626 --> 36:11.878
that's motive.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.589
And we believe
that our fine police force

36:14.672 --> 36:18.634
will find our bells
before Christmas Eve.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.428
Wait, but what about
Mr. Martin?

36:20.511 --> 36:22.805
We can't just focus
on one suspect, Kenny.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.807
That's the mistake my dad
is making with your dad.

36:24.891 --> 36:27.435
But what if you don't find
the bells before Christmas?

36:27.518 --> 36:28.728
-Yeah!
-Or ever?

36:28.811 --> 36:31.397
We have Sheriff Pierce
on the case.

36:31.480 --> 36:32.899
He has promised me

36:32.982 --> 36:36.485
that he will return the bells
to their rightful place.

36:36.569 --> 36:38.029
Am I right, Sheriff?

36:39.614 --> 36:40.698
Right now...

36:43.075 --> 36:44.952
these are our suspects.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.245
Suspects?

36:48.873 --> 36:50.541
Violet...

36:50.625 --> 36:54.670
you don't seriously think
you can solve this case,
do you?

36:54.754 --> 36:56.422
Why not?

36:56.505 --> 36:58.549
I mean, for starters,
you still sleep
with a stuffed animal.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.551
I already have
two new suspects.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.970
She's trying to get my dad home
before Christmas.

37:03.054 --> 37:06.265
And that's in two days, Maddie.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.809
Kenny, I'm...
I'm really sorry
about your dad.

37:08.893 --> 37:12.271
I hope it's all just
a misunderstanding.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.690
Can you drive me and Kenny
to the police station?

37:16.067 --> 37:17.360
I just got home.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.779
Kenny's mom is there
visiting his dad.

37:19.862 --> 37:21.906
Kenny wants to go, too.

37:21.989 --> 37:23.115
Uh, yeah.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.408
Could you, please?

37:25.868 --> 37:26.744
Fine.

37:26.827 --> 37:27.828
I'll take you.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.330
You don't... um...

37:29.413 --> 37:31.332
you don't think your brother
would want to go, do you?

37:31.415 --> 37:35.169
Um, I don't think so.
He's kinda mad
about all of this.

37:35.252 --> 37:37.213
He's been moping around
the house all day.

37:37.296 --> 37:39.090
Of course. Um...

37:39.173 --> 37:40.508
Okay, grab your stuff.

37:49.141 --> 37:51.310
All right, here you go.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.311
Thank you, Maddie.

37:52.395 --> 37:53.354
You're welcome.

37:56.649 --> 38:01.362
If you're going to check in
on Harrison, your lip gloss
is in the glove box.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.787
All the business owners
are calling my office

38:09.870 --> 38:12.039
worried no one will come
to the celebration

38:12.123 --> 38:15.793
if the bells aren't found
before Christmas Eve.

38:15.876 --> 38:18.629
I know, Dad.
I'm sorry about that.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.464
They'll be found.

38:20.548 --> 38:23.009
Now, how can you be
so sure about that, Violet?

38:23.092 --> 38:24.969
The bells mean everything
to Pleasant Bay.

38:25.052 --> 38:28.180
No one is going to rest
until the bells are back
where they belong.

38:28.264 --> 38:31.892
Maybe I should make
this girl the new sheriff.

38:31.976 --> 38:36.564
She's the only one
with any determination
around here.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.274
We're doing the best we can.

38:38.357 --> 38:41.777
Yeah, well, if your best
doesn't include
finding the bells,

38:42.653 --> 38:43.904
it's not enough.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.573
Sheriff's department.

38:45.656 --> 38:47.992
He's out right now.
I can take a message.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.662
Your dad's out on a call,
Violet.

38:51.746 --> 38:52.913
I just came with Kenny.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.582
He wants to see his dad.

38:54.665 --> 38:55.916
Is that okay?

38:56.000 --> 38:57.752
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.
Come on, Kenny.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.462
Your mom's already back there.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.424
I'm just gonna wait
in my dad's office.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.134
Okay.

39:11.015 --> 39:14.769
Business is down at the diner
since those bells were stolen.

39:14.852 --> 39:16.771
People's moods are, too.

39:16.854 --> 39:19.148
Well...

39:19.231 --> 39:21.233
gotta keep up hope.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.319
How are you holding up, son?

39:23.402 --> 39:24.737
I'm okay, Dad.

39:24.820 --> 39:27.907
Um, Violet's helping, too.
She's really smart.

39:32.161 --> 39:33.621
Well, thank you, Kenny.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.039
And you make sure
you tell Violet

39:35.122 --> 39:37.041
I really appreciate it.

39:38.292 --> 39:39.168
And, uh...

39:40.920 --> 39:43.089
tell Harrison
I really miss him.

39:46.675 --> 39:50.554
Password. Mom's birthday.

40:12.576 --> 40:13.661
Sheriff's department.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.204
Okay, tell me what happened.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.333
Yes, as soon as he gets back.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.379
Uh-huh.
I'll let the sheriff know.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.352
Come on. Come on.

40:38.435 --> 40:39.937
Hey, what you doing?

40:40.020 --> 40:42.481
I was just looking up something
for my project.

40:45.442 --> 40:48.154
-On the police database?

40:48.237 --> 40:51.031
I just had an idea
who might have stolen
the bells.

40:52.449 --> 40:55.327
We're pretty sure we know
who stole the bells.

40:55.411 --> 40:57.621
I just want to look up
a license plate number.

40:58.914 --> 41:00.499
Does your dad know
you're doing this?

41:01.584 --> 41:02.418
No.

41:04.128 --> 41:07.590
I don't like the idea of you
keeping secrets from your dad.

41:07.673 --> 41:09.341
I just don't want to worry him.

41:09.425 --> 41:12.595
Well, little kids
aren't allowed
on the police database.

41:12.678 --> 41:14.680
But police officers are.

41:17.266 --> 41:18.767
Are you a police officer?

41:18.851 --> 41:21.228
No, but you are.

41:26.483 --> 41:29.695
All right. You're gonna
have to tell me a lot more
if you want my help.

41:29.778 --> 41:34.283
Fine. I'll tell you everything.
But you have to promise
you'll help me.

41:45.836 --> 41:46.921
Hey.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.005
Hey.

41:50.299 --> 41:54.553
Do you maybe
wanna talk about anything?

41:54.637 --> 41:56.931
You don't have to be
nice to me, you know.

41:57.014 --> 41:59.892
I'm not just being nice.

41:59.975 --> 42:02.603
I thought you might
need a friend.

42:10.110 --> 42:12.112
I guess that doesn't
sound so bad.

42:20.704 --> 42:23.874
Do you really think that
your dad could have done this?

42:25.292 --> 42:28.587
He's stolen before.
That's why he was in jail.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.923
What did he steal?

42:31.715 --> 42:34.677
Well, nothing, really.

42:34.760 --> 42:37.346
He stole nothing
and went to jail?

42:40.015 --> 42:42.768
He worked in a huge warehouse,
and someone recruited him

42:42.851 --> 42:45.479
to make a delivery
for a few extra bucks.

42:45.562 --> 42:47.773
The truck was
full of stolen goods.

42:47.856 --> 42:49.692
Oh, no.

42:49.775 --> 42:52.444
Yeah. He swears
he knew nothing about it.

42:53.654 --> 42:55.489
You don't believe that?

42:55.572 --> 42:57.825
All I know is, we spent
eight months without him
while he was in jail,

42:57.908 --> 43:00.661
and everyone at school
looked at me like
I was the son of a criminal.

43:01.912 --> 43:03.497
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

43:10.087 --> 43:11.964
My dad grew up here,

43:12.047 --> 43:16.135
so we moved here from Portland
when he got out, you know?
Start fresh.

43:17.928 --> 43:20.139
My grandma had left us
this place.

43:21.724 --> 43:23.600
Yeah, I remember her.

43:23.684 --> 43:25.894
I'm really sorry
about her passing,

43:25.978 --> 43:29.857
but I'm also really glad
that you got a chance
to have a fresh start.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.986
Now I'm the son
of a criminal again.

43:34.069 --> 43:35.612
I just can't get away from it.

43:37.156 --> 43:39.116
Is that why you're not
on social media?

43:41.618 --> 43:42.828
You tried to look me up?

43:46.290 --> 43:47.333
Maybe.

43:58.052 --> 43:59.970
Can you at least
tell me her name?

44:00.054 --> 44:04.183
No, Violet. I already looked up
the license plate number
like you asked.

44:04.266 --> 44:06.393
Now you have to do
the rest of this
on my terms.

44:06.477 --> 44:07.686
Fine.

44:12.149 --> 44:13.233
Are these cupcakes?

44:14.651 --> 44:16.445
They were cupcakes.

44:16.528 --> 44:19.365
Sorry. Meant to throw
that away.

44:20.532 --> 44:23.744
It's not usually
such a mess in here.

44:23.827 --> 44:26.163
Is that a London plane leaf?

44:27.456 --> 44:28.582
Can I have this?

44:29.166 --> 44:30.250
The leaf?

44:30.334 --> 44:32.920
Yeah. It's for
a science project.

44:33.003 --> 44:36.006
Sure. You can have the leaf.

44:36.090 --> 44:38.509
I don't currently
have any plans for it.

44:44.556 --> 44:45.682
My gosh.

44:47.976 --> 44:50.270
What, the tins?

44:50.354 --> 44:54.441
Yeah, um, my mom,
she used to collect
this kind of stuff.

44:54.525 --> 44:57.111
This one is
in pretty good condition.

45:01.281 --> 45:03.784
What happened to your mom?

45:03.867 --> 45:07.413
Most people get
kind of uncomfortable
talking about my mom.

45:09.540 --> 45:11.375
I'd like to hear about her.

45:13.794 --> 45:15.295
Well, um...

45:16.672 --> 45:20.801
she was an amazing person.

45:20.884 --> 45:24.138
She was so funny.
Um...

45:24.221 --> 45:26.181
she would do
these little voices

45:26.265 --> 45:28.225
when she would tell us
bedtime stories.

45:28.308 --> 45:32.146
And she actually made Violet
pee her pants one time.

45:32.229 --> 45:33.480
Poor Violet.

45:34.565 --> 45:35.858
Yeah, no, it wasn't Violet.

45:35.941 --> 45:38.110
-She made me pee my pants
one time.
-Yep.

45:38.193 --> 45:39.278
Um...

45:40.904 --> 45:42.865
The, um...

45:42.948 --> 45:45.492
The cancer...

45:46.660 --> 45:47.995
...came on...

45:49.580 --> 45:50.706
pretty quick.

45:52.916 --> 45:55.711
And then one day...

45:57.838 --> 45:59.590
she was just gone.

46:07.181 --> 46:08.765
How did Violet take it?

46:10.768 --> 46:13.770
She was so little.

46:13.854 --> 46:16.815
I have no idea
how she processed it.

46:19.109 --> 46:20.736
How did you process it?

46:28.619 --> 46:32.080
Maybe
I haven't yet, either.

46:34.958 --> 46:38.587
I... I still wake up
and I walk into her kitchen

46:38.670 --> 46:40.255
hoping she'll be there, so...

46:43.133 --> 46:45.260
My dad chose
not to be in our kitchen.

46:48.138 --> 46:51.391
I really wish
you didn't think like that.

46:51.475 --> 46:56.271
How can you have
a relationship with him if you
spend every day blaming him?

46:57.481 --> 46:58.857
Take it from me.

46:59.775 --> 47:02.861
One day, it'll be too late.

47:23.507 --> 47:25.425
The Ashton Home?

47:25.509 --> 47:28.929
That's what came up
when I searched
the license plate.

47:29.012 --> 47:32.599
Mr. Martin is stealing money
for a children's home?

47:32.683 --> 47:33.600
Stealing? Uh...

47:33.684 --> 47:35.602
Um, our newest deputy here

47:35.686 --> 47:39.147
saw you giving some money
to a woman
from the Ashton Home.

47:40.065 --> 47:41.567
Barbara?

47:41.650 --> 47:42.609
Yes, I did.

47:42.693 --> 47:45.779
See? I told you. He lied to me.

47:45.862 --> 47:48.240
That was our
Christmas donation.

47:48.323 --> 47:51.910
For presents,
for the children at the home.

47:51.994 --> 47:54.913
Presents for children?
Not much of a crime.

47:56.331 --> 47:58.250
But he...

47:58.333 --> 48:01.295
You told me the donation money
was for museum upkeep.

48:01.378 --> 48:02.713
It is.

48:02.796 --> 48:04.798
Then why were you giving it
to the Ashton Home?

48:04.881 --> 48:07.384
Oh. Those were
our December donations.

48:07.467 --> 48:10.095
Everything from
the first three weeks
in December

48:10.178 --> 48:12.097
goes to the children's home.

48:12.764 --> 48:14.308
But he said...

48:20.314 --> 48:22.357
What about the bells?

48:22.441 --> 48:24.401
-The bells?
-You have a key to the museum.

48:24.484 --> 48:28.363
You could have taken the bells
that night as easily
as Mr. Bottoms.

48:29.239 --> 48:30.240
I...

48:32.200 --> 48:35.203
I was at
the Spirit River Casino
all night...

48:35.287 --> 48:36.496
Did anyone see you there?

48:36.580 --> 48:39.374
A lot of people
saw him there, Violet.

48:39.458 --> 48:42.586
Cameras, too.
We already checked his alibi
for that time.

48:42.669 --> 48:43.545
Yeah.

48:44.254 --> 48:45.964
I did that.

48:46.048 --> 48:50.093
This is why 11-year-olds
shouldn't be running
police investigations.

48:50.177 --> 48:51.303
You called my dad?

48:51.386 --> 48:53.263
It's for your own good, Violet.

48:56.642 --> 48:58.727
You shouldn't be interfering
with this, Violet.

48:58.810 --> 49:00.103
-Dad, I...
-You're just a kid.

49:00.187 --> 49:01.355
I can still help.

49:01.438 --> 49:02.898
But you're not helping.

49:02.981 --> 49:05.275
You're taking me away
from the actual investigation.

49:06.568 --> 49:08.945
Mom would have thought
I could help.

49:09.029 --> 49:10.113
Violet--

49:10.197 --> 49:12.032
She wouldn't just see me
as some dumb kid.

49:33.053 --> 49:33.804
Dad?

49:33.887 --> 49:35.389
We've had a rough day.

49:44.731 --> 49:45.941
You okay?

49:47.901 --> 49:48.985
I'm fine.

50:00.497 --> 50:04.418
I just wish I could have got
Mr. Bottoms home for Christmas.

50:09.673 --> 50:11.383
Is this about something else?

50:17.180 --> 50:19.099
I wish Mom was here.

50:21.685 --> 50:23.145
She is.

50:24.187 --> 50:26.273
She's in you.

50:26.356 --> 50:28.608
She's in me.

50:28.692 --> 50:31.653
She's part of everything
that we do.

50:31.737 --> 50:33.780
Why didn't anyone save her?

50:36.283 --> 50:37.159
Yeah.

50:38.869 --> 50:44.249
Mom didn't die because
we didn't do enough.

50:44.332 --> 50:47.377
Everyone did everything
that they could.

50:48.545 --> 50:50.589
I wish I could have saved her.

50:52.215 --> 50:53.633
Oh, Vi.

50:54.843 --> 50:56.386
You couldn't have.

50:59.055 --> 51:03.351
You know that
getting Mr. Bottoms home
for Christmas...

51:04.936 --> 51:08.023
it won't bring Mom home
for Christmas.

51:08.106 --> 51:09.983
I had to at least try.

51:10.067 --> 51:14.780
But you can't go around
accusing other people, Vi.

51:14.863 --> 51:17.073
Not without real proof.

51:20.994 --> 51:26.041
You know,
the best thing about you,
it isn't your big brain...

51:26.124 --> 51:28.168
it's your big, giant heart.

51:30.253 --> 51:31.463
I love you, Maddie.

51:31.546 --> 51:33.131
I love you, too.

51:47.938 --> 51:49.314
A little late, Terry.

51:49.397 --> 51:51.358
I didn't get home
till after midnight last night.

51:51.441 --> 51:53.693
Well, it's not
letting up out there.
There is a list on your desk.

51:53.777 --> 51:55.195
All right.

51:55.278 --> 51:56.822
We're shorthanded right now.
We'll get somebody on it.

51:56.905 --> 51:58.031
Deputy Violet.

51:58.114 --> 51:59.699
In the house.

51:59.783 --> 52:02.828
Hi, Terry.
Maddie was busy this morning.

52:02.911 --> 52:05.413
She should be here any minute
to get me, though.

52:05.497 --> 52:07.290
Always happy to have you here.

52:08.291 --> 52:09.376
You still mad at me?

52:10.877 --> 52:11.711
No.

52:11.795 --> 52:13.880
I get why you called my dad.

52:13.964 --> 52:17.676
It's fine. I'm done
investigating anyways.

52:19.302 --> 52:22.639
Don't worry.
We're gonna solve this case.

52:22.722 --> 52:25.517
I just wanna say bye
to Mr. Bottoms.

52:25.600 --> 52:26.810
No problem.

52:32.691 --> 52:34.025
Hey, Mr. Bottoms.

52:34.109 --> 52:35.402
How are you doing?

52:35.485 --> 52:36.778
Hey, Violet.

52:38.530 --> 52:41.408
I'm okay.
All things considered.

52:41.491 --> 52:43.869
Maggie brought me
a change of clothes,
which was nice.

52:44.744 --> 52:46.580
I hear you're on the case.

52:46.663 --> 52:49.666
I was, but Deputy Terry
ratted me out.

52:51.293 --> 52:53.712
Oh, Terry.

52:54.713 --> 52:57.007
How long have you known him?

52:57.090 --> 53:00.176
I knew him from back
in my basketball coaching days.

53:00.260 --> 53:02.596
His dad asked me
to make him an assistant coach.

53:02.679 --> 53:05.181
Instill some discipline.

53:05.265 --> 53:06.308
How'd that go?

53:07.142 --> 53:08.268
Not good.

53:09.352 --> 53:10.770
I had to fire him.

53:10.854 --> 53:14.774
He wasn't too happy about that.
Neither was his dad.

53:14.858 --> 53:17.777
You know, the mayor
is pretty hard on him.

53:17.861 --> 53:21.072
But look at him now.
I guess it worked out.

53:21.156 --> 53:22.532
Look at him now?

53:22.616 --> 53:25.118
The mayor asked my dad
to give him this job, too.

53:25.201 --> 53:27.662
-That's the reason
he works here.

53:29.122 --> 53:31.666
I guess it's all about
who you know, isn't it?

53:33.585 --> 53:35.045
I guess.

53:35.128 --> 53:36.463
Bye, Mr. Bottoms.

53:37.130 --> 53:38.048
Bye, Violet.

54:11.581 --> 54:14.709
Mr. Bottoms,
do you own any white sneakers?

54:15.752 --> 54:17.921
White sneakers? No.

54:18.004 --> 54:21.216
Pretty much,
these are my work boots.
It's all I ever wear. Why?

54:23.385 --> 54:25.679
I think I might have to reopen
your case.

54:27.681 --> 54:28.515
Okay.

54:47.909 --> 54:50.120
Maddie, I think
I found some proof.

54:50.203 --> 54:53.164
Violet Pierce, I thought
you were done with this.

54:53.248 --> 54:56.876
I was wrong about Glenn Martin,
but this is the real thing.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.336
Violet.

54:58.420 --> 55:00.255
If there's anything we can do
to help Mr. Bottoms,

55:00.338 --> 55:02.132
shouldn't we at least try?

55:06.511 --> 55:08.013
Buckle your seat belt.

55:10.265 --> 55:13.143
Do you think Harrison
would be willing
to look at this?

55:15.395 --> 55:17.022
What are we looking at?

55:17.105 --> 55:19.566
This is our home security
footage my dad had
on his computer.

55:19.649 --> 55:22.861
It sees over the fence,
into your yard.

55:25.905 --> 55:28.324
They think that's your dad
going into the garage.

55:28.408 --> 55:29.951
That's why they searched there.

55:31.703 --> 55:33.121
It could be.

55:33.204 --> 55:34.998
But look.

55:35.081 --> 55:37.625
You can't actually see him
go in or out of the house,
from this angle.

55:42.422 --> 55:43.548
Yeah,
but look at this.

55:44.382 --> 55:45.759
What is that?

55:45.842 --> 55:48.261
That looks like it could be
the logo from the museum.

55:48.344 --> 55:50.513
It's on all of our dad's
work shirts and jackets.

55:50.597 --> 55:52.557
But how many does he have?

55:52.640 --> 55:54.309
Jackets?

55:54.392 --> 55:57.103
I don't know. A couple.
He does keep one at work.

56:01.274 --> 56:02.901
What about this?

56:02.984 --> 56:04.569
Whoever took the bells
also took a jacket
from the museum

56:04.652 --> 56:06.196
so they would look
like your dad.

56:06.279 --> 56:08.948
Then he could have put it
right back when he was done.

56:09.616 --> 56:10.950
That's a stretch.

56:11.034 --> 56:13.203
Violet, we can barely see
anything in this video.

56:13.286 --> 56:15.038
It's too grainy and dark.

56:16.706 --> 56:19.876
But we can see this.
Look at his shoes.

56:19.959 --> 56:21.920
White sneakers
with two stripes.

56:22.003 --> 56:25.381
Violet,
a lot of people
own white sneakers.

56:25.465 --> 56:26.549
Yeah, but my dad doesn't.

56:29.719 --> 56:33.264
He hates how white shoes
get dirty so fast.

56:33.348 --> 56:36.309
But do you know
who does own white sneakers
with two stripes,

56:36.392 --> 56:38.103
just like those?

56:40.688 --> 56:41.689
Deputy Terry.

56:43.733 --> 56:46.569
You think Deputy Terry
stole the bells?

56:48.530 --> 56:49.948
<i> I think</i>
<i>he has an old grudge</i>
<i>with Mr. Bottoms.</i>

56:50.031 --> 56:50.990
I had to fire him.

56:51.074 --> 56:52.951
He wasn't too happy about that.

56:53.034 --> 56:56.830
He went out of his way
to stop me from looking
into other suspects.

56:56.913 --> 57:00.041
<i>Terry knows</i>
<i>all the details of the case</i>
<i>and everyone involved.</i>

57:00.125 --> 57:01.709
<i>He's been to my house,</i>

57:01.793 --> 57:03.628
<i>he knows about</i>
<i>the security cameras.</i>

57:03.711 --> 57:06.339
He could have been messing
with Dad's investigation
this whole time.

57:06.422 --> 57:08.508
But why would Terry
steal the bells? For money?

57:08.591 --> 57:13.179
For attention.
If Deputy Terry finds the bells
right before Christmas Eve,

57:13.263 --> 57:16.349
he's going to be the town hero.
That's his motive.

57:17.600 --> 57:18.768
She's good.

57:18.852 --> 57:20.019
So do we tell your dad?

57:20.103 --> 57:21.396
-No.
-No.

57:21.479 --> 57:23.731
After what happened with
Mr. Martin at the museum,

57:23.815 --> 57:26.276
we need actual proof.

57:26.359 --> 57:28.403
Terry's sneakers
isn't enough evidence.

57:28.486 --> 57:30.697
Although a really
weird coincidence.

57:30.780 --> 57:32.198
Where can we get more evidence?

57:32.282 --> 57:34.951
We have to find the bells.
That's the real proof.

57:35.910 --> 57:37.370
What do you wanna do?

57:37.453 --> 57:38.746
Break into Terry's house?
See if the bells are there?

57:38.830 --> 57:40.248
No, we can't do that.

57:42.959 --> 57:45.253
But he does leave
a lot of stuff in his car.

57:48.214 --> 57:49.674
Hey, you're back.

57:49.757 --> 57:50.800
Hi, Deputy Terry.

57:50.884 --> 57:52.302
You forget something?

57:52.385 --> 57:54.137
Uh, I was just wondering
if I could see my dad again.

57:54.220 --> 57:57.432
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.
Come on, follow me.

58:00.185 --> 58:04.147
Hey, I'm pretty busy, Dad. No.

58:13.573 --> 58:14.574
She did it.

58:14.657 --> 58:15.658
Let's go.

58:17.535 --> 58:18.453
Oh, come on.

58:23.333 --> 58:25.668
Well, you should have
a little bit more faith in me.

58:35.345 --> 58:38.890
I don't know.
Have you tried unplugging it
and restarting it?

58:54.864 --> 58:57.825
Hey, Dad, I...
I'm pretty busy right now.

58:57.909 --> 58:59.035
I gotta go.

59:01.037 --> 59:01.913
Maddie.

59:01.996 --> 59:03.248
Come on, let's go.

59:14.217 --> 59:15.093
Violet.

59:17.637 --> 59:18.972
You caught me.

59:20.223 --> 59:21.975
Just take one. Okay?

59:22.058 --> 59:23.309
Okay.

59:23.393 --> 59:25.979
No, I'm not having
trouble with Violet, Dad.

59:26.062 --> 59:27.230
Everything's fine.

59:27.313 --> 59:30.233
Hey, Violet, um, we need to go.

59:30.316 --> 59:31.943
We just got here.

59:32.026 --> 59:34.112
I know. I'm sorry,
that's my fault.

59:34.195 --> 59:37.282
Um, can you grab Kenny?

59:37.365 --> 59:39.200
Sisters. Am I right?

59:39.284 --> 59:40.994
Hmm.

59:41.077 --> 59:44.330
Oh, there you are.
Let's go.

59:52.922 --> 59:56.634
There were no bells
in Terry's car.
Mostly just regular cop stuff.

59:56.718 --> 59:58.136
Oh, man.

59:58.219 --> 1:00:00.596
But I did find something
that was a little weird. A map.

1:00:01.597 --> 1:00:03.933
"Department of Public Works?"

1:00:04.017 --> 1:00:05.476
Hey, that's...
that's where Terry worked

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.186
before he started
at the sheriff's office.

1:00:07.270 --> 1:00:09.731
Man, Terry's had a lot of jobs.

1:00:09.814 --> 1:00:11.441
Is this a tunnel map?

1:00:11.524 --> 1:00:13.026
There's something
similar in Portland.

1:00:13.109 --> 1:00:15.320
They're called
the Shanghai tunnels.

1:00:15.403 --> 1:00:18.197
They connect Downtown Portland
to the Willamette River.

1:00:18.281 --> 1:00:20.533
They run all over the city.

1:00:20.616 --> 1:00:22.327
All under the city.

1:00:23.202 --> 1:00:25.121
All under the city, yeah.

1:00:25.204 --> 1:00:27.749
But there's access points
all across town,

1:00:27.832 --> 1:00:30.918
and just like these tunnels
right here in Pleasant Bay.
And, look.

1:00:31.002 --> 1:00:34.505
There happens to be one right
under the Pleasant Bay museum.

1:00:34.589 --> 1:00:36.466
That's means.

1:00:36.549 --> 1:00:38.384
You don't need a key to
the front door if you're coming
through a tunnel.

1:00:38.468 --> 1:00:40.970
We have motive and means now.
This is getting good.

1:00:41.054 --> 1:00:42.555
We have to find

1:00:42.638 --> 1:00:44.682
-that tunnel entrance
under the museum.
-Yeah.

1:00:49.437 --> 1:00:50.980
Hey!

1:00:51.064 --> 1:00:52.315
-What are you guys doin'?
-Nothing.

1:00:52.398 --> 1:00:54.859
We were, uh...
we were just leaving.

1:01:20.176 --> 1:01:21.761
It's definitely closed today.

1:01:21.844 --> 1:01:23.096
Now what?

1:01:23.179 --> 1:01:24.972
Well, that's why we stopped
at our house.

1:01:25.056 --> 1:01:27.767
To grab my dad's
backup set of keys.

1:01:27.850 --> 1:01:31.270
That's why they think
he did it, right?
His keys.

1:01:31.354 --> 1:01:33.606
Don't you also think he did it?

1:01:35.691 --> 1:01:37.527
No. Not anymore.

1:01:40.279 --> 1:01:41.781
And I wanna find out who did.

1:01:41.864 --> 1:01:43.116
Wait! The alarm!

1:01:43.199 --> 1:01:44.992
I know how
we can deactivate it.

1:01:45.076 --> 1:01:48.913
As long as
one of those keys also opens
the circuit breaker box.

1:01:57.713 --> 1:02:01.134
If there's an access tunnel
in this building...

1:02:01.217 --> 1:02:03.094
it's probably down there.

1:02:05.096 --> 1:02:06.848
You should go and check.

1:02:08.891 --> 1:02:10.726
We're all going down together.

1:02:23.614 --> 1:02:25.450
-Got it?
-Yeah.

1:02:33.332 --> 1:02:36.961
I guess we're looking
for a door or something.

1:02:37.044 --> 1:02:40.506
Okay. Violet and I
will take this side.

1:02:40.590 --> 1:02:41.966
Come on, Braveheart.

1:02:42.049 --> 1:02:43.759
Who's Braveheart?

1:02:55.271 --> 1:02:56.314
Come on.

1:03:02.653 --> 1:03:03.988
Nothing.

1:03:04.071 --> 1:03:05.364
Nothing on our side either.

1:03:05.448 --> 1:03:07.366
Maybe there's another basement.

1:03:10.745 --> 1:03:13.456
We have to check
under these boxes.

1:03:13.539 --> 1:03:16.167
Okay, but how could someone
get out through the ground

1:03:16.250 --> 1:03:19.045
and then also use the boxes
to cover the opening?

1:03:19.128 --> 1:03:21.339
Deputy Terry was down here
the next morning

1:03:21.422 --> 1:03:23.758
<i>while they were investigating.</i>

1:03:23.841 --> 1:03:27.428
He could have put boxes
over the opening
to cover his tracks.

1:03:31.307 --> 1:03:32.475
All right.

1:03:32.558 --> 1:03:34.519
Remember,
lift with your legs.

1:03:34.602 --> 1:03:36.187
I got it, Kenny.

1:03:45.029 --> 1:03:46.739
That sure looks like something.

1:03:52.495 --> 1:03:53.329
Whoa!

1:03:53.412 --> 1:03:54.956
Yeah, uh, no.

1:03:55.039 --> 1:03:56.749
This has to be it.

1:03:56.832 --> 1:03:57.959
Now what?

1:03:58.042 --> 1:04:00.461
We have to find out
where it goes.

1:04:00.545 --> 1:04:02.838
Um, I don't think
that's such a great idea.

1:04:02.922 --> 1:04:04.257
Man up, Kenny.

1:04:04.340 --> 1:04:06.050
That's sexist.

1:04:06.133 --> 1:04:07.260
Give me a hand.

1:04:12.682 --> 1:04:15.142
Looks like
power conduits.

1:04:15.226 --> 1:04:18.396
Gas lines, water pipes maybe.

1:04:18.479 --> 1:04:19.480
What's that?

1:04:21.190 --> 1:04:23.859
Looks like
an emergency power shutoff.

1:04:23.943 --> 1:04:27.196
That's how Terry
could have deactivated
the security system.

1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:28.906
He could have done it
from down here.

1:04:29.949 --> 1:04:31.742
What was that?

1:04:31.826 --> 1:04:33.786
It's fine. It's just the pipes.

1:04:33.869 --> 1:04:35.997
I got this. Stay behind me.

1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:37.873
That's also sexist.

1:04:37.957 --> 1:04:40.459
But I'm also gonna stay
behind you.

1:04:50.511 --> 1:04:51.721
Where are we going?

1:04:51.804 --> 1:04:53.097
Let's just see
where it goes.

1:04:53.180 --> 1:04:54.599
Maybe we'll find clues
along the way.

1:05:00.146 --> 1:05:02.690
Did anyone
bring snacks?

1:05:04.775 --> 1:05:06.235
Pipes, Kenny.

1:05:18.247 --> 1:05:19.582
What now?

1:05:21.751 --> 1:05:23.210
This does not feel safe.

1:05:23.294 --> 1:05:24.670
So, should we split up?

1:05:24.754 --> 1:05:25.671
No!

1:05:27.256 --> 1:05:28.841
Let me see the map.

1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:34.055
What are you looking for?

1:05:34.138 --> 1:05:35.765
I'm not sure yet.

1:05:37.433 --> 1:05:39.977
Where would Deputy Terry
come into these tunnels?

1:05:46.525 --> 1:05:47.526
There.

1:05:47.610 --> 1:05:48.611
That's it.

1:05:51.781 --> 1:05:53.699
The school? Why there?

1:05:53.783 --> 1:05:56.202
It's surrounded
by London plane trees.

1:05:56.285 --> 1:06:00.081
-So?
-I found a London plane tree
leaf in Deputy Terry's car.

1:06:02.291 --> 1:06:05.002
<i>He's been there recently.</i>

1:06:05.086 --> 1:06:07.296
The school was closed that day
for winter break.

1:06:08.464 --> 1:06:10.049
Wait.

1:06:10.132 --> 1:06:13.177
But then how would Deputy Terry
get into the school that night?

1:06:14.220 --> 1:06:15.805
They have a lock box

1:06:15.888 --> 1:06:18.557
for police to use
in case of emergencies.

1:06:18.641 --> 1:06:19.892
The school it is.

1:06:33.489 --> 1:06:34.699
What's this?

1:06:36.409 --> 1:06:38.703
Looks like
some kind of storage.

1:06:47.253 --> 1:06:49.505
There.
That should be the school.

1:06:51.006 --> 1:06:53.175
Yup.
There's a hatch.

1:06:55.678 --> 1:06:56.929
Now we tell your dad?

1:06:57.012 --> 1:06:58.055
No, not yet.

1:06:58.139 --> 1:07:00.766
I'll go up first.

1:07:00.850 --> 1:07:04.270
Breaking into school.
Never thought
I'd be doing this.

1:07:08.482 --> 1:07:09.650
Come on.

1:07:11.652 --> 1:07:12.695
So, this is our school?

1:07:12.778 --> 1:07:14.739
Yeah, we're in the boiler room.

1:07:14.822 --> 1:07:16.449
-Look.
-Oh.

1:07:16.532 --> 1:07:18.284
Our dad works here
on the weekends
to make extra cash.

1:07:18.367 --> 1:07:20.953
He also used to coach
basketball here, too.

1:07:21.036 --> 1:07:23.664
That's right.
A long time ago, with Terry.

1:07:24.874 --> 1:07:26.625
Deputy Terry?

1:07:26.709 --> 1:07:29.086
Is that just
a coincidence or...

1:07:29.170 --> 1:07:30.171
No.

1:07:34.467 --> 1:07:36.343
Terry plans to find
the bells here.

1:07:36.427 --> 1:07:38.053
If Terry finds the bells here,

1:07:38.137 --> 1:07:39.972
that's another thing connected
to your dad.

1:07:40.055 --> 1:07:42.391
It'll make him look
even more guilty.

1:07:42.475 --> 1:07:45.478
So, the bells
could actually be here
right now?

1:07:45.561 --> 1:07:47.772
No, but our dad already
searched the school,

1:07:47.855 --> 1:07:50.483
and he said
the bells weren't here.

1:07:50.566 --> 1:07:54.528
Maybe they were just focused
on places related to
Mr. Bottoms' work as a janitor.

1:07:54.612 --> 1:07:56.280
Your dad used to coach here.

1:07:56.363 --> 1:07:59.283
Terry could have planted
the bells somewhere
related to that.

1:08:00.534 --> 1:08:01.535
You're right.

1:08:04.538 --> 1:08:06.081
Come on, let's check it out.

1:08:13.005 --> 1:08:14.089
This is so weird.

1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:21.847
Okay, there's the gym,
there's the locker room,
there's Coach's office.

1:08:21.931 --> 1:08:24.892
There's so many hiding spots.
The bells could be anywhere.

1:08:24.975 --> 1:08:27.019
Well,
let's start looking.

1:08:27.103 --> 1:08:29.980
Maddie and I will start
with the locker rooms.

1:08:30.064 --> 1:08:32.775
-Okay, I'll start
with the bins.
-I'll check the lockers.

1:08:40.282 --> 1:08:41.450
I have an idea.

1:08:41.534 --> 1:08:43.035
Great. What?

1:08:43.118 --> 1:08:44.370
Do that thing where you think
about something for a moment

1:08:44.453 --> 1:08:46.121
and then you have
a brilliant idea.

1:08:46.205 --> 1:08:48.040
Kenny, be serious.
The Ringing of the Bells
is tomorrow.

1:08:48.123 --> 1:08:50.042
Come on, I'll help you.

1:08:50.793 --> 1:08:52.127
The bells.

1:08:52.211 --> 1:08:54.797
The bells. The bells.

1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:57.424
Kenny, stop. We have to
just look everywhere.

1:08:58.050 --> 1:08:59.176
Fine.

1:09:02.429 --> 1:09:03.556
Kenny, don't move.

1:09:03.639 --> 1:09:05.474
-What?
-Let me see under your foot.

1:09:10.980 --> 1:09:13.148
That's from the bell's
display case at the museum.

1:09:13.232 --> 1:09:14.567
How do you know?

1:09:14.650 --> 1:09:16.277
I found a piece just like it
when we were there.

1:09:16.360 --> 1:09:18.612
It had a purple tint
just like it.

1:09:18.696 --> 1:09:20.906
Yeah. Good one, Kenny.

1:09:20.990 --> 1:09:24.410
If this is where Terry
took the bells out of a pocket
or a bag,

1:09:24.493 --> 1:09:26.620
some glass
could have fallen out.

1:09:26.704 --> 1:09:29.748
That means he was about
to hide them somewhere close.

1:09:31.542 --> 1:09:32.751
But where?

1:09:43.137 --> 1:09:44.847
You heard that, too, right?

1:09:52.730 --> 1:09:54.148
The trophy case.

1:09:54.231 --> 1:09:56.108
Of course. Guys, come here!

1:10:00.362 --> 1:10:01.405
What?

1:10:07.244 --> 1:10:08.412
My dad's trophy.

1:10:09.872 --> 1:10:11.957
Um... his keys.

1:10:12.041 --> 1:10:13.584
One of them
should open the trophy case.

1:10:17.338 --> 1:10:18.255
Got it!

1:10:20.007 --> 1:10:20.966
Okay.

1:10:25.387 --> 1:10:26.639
Oh, my gosh!

1:10:26.722 --> 1:10:28.974
The bells! We did it!
You did it, Violet!

1:10:29.058 --> 1:10:30.309
You found the bells!

1:10:30.392 --> 1:10:33.062
-Violet, you did it!
-Great job, Violet.

1:10:33.145 --> 1:10:34.772
Now do we call Dad?

1:10:34.855 --> 1:10:36.148
Now we call Dad.

1:10:36.231 --> 1:10:37.691
Okay.

1:10:37.775 --> 1:10:39.735
-But don't mention me
using his computer.
-Okay.

1:10:39.818 --> 1:10:41.195
Or searching Terry's car.

1:10:41.278 --> 1:10:43.322
-Okay.
-Or breaking into the museum.

1:10:43.405 --> 1:10:46.700
This is going to be
a very short story.

1:10:48.661 --> 1:10:49.828
Someone's here.

1:11:08.472 --> 1:11:10.808
Maybe it was just the wind.

1:11:11.892 --> 1:11:12.851
That's right.

1:11:14.853 --> 1:11:16.814
I found the bells
at the high school.

1:11:18.232 --> 1:11:19.191
It's Deputy Terry.

1:11:19.274 --> 1:11:20.526
He's here to grab the bells.

1:11:20.609 --> 1:11:22.069
Let's get outta here.

1:11:22.152 --> 1:11:24.238
No. Let's punch this guy
in the face. He framed our dad.

1:11:24.321 --> 1:11:27.533
No. This is our chance
to get more proof.

1:11:27.616 --> 1:11:29.994
I'm giving you guys
the exclusive on this.

1:11:32.413 --> 1:11:34.832
You're gonna wanna
get a news crew over here
right away.

1:11:35.708 --> 1:11:36.792
I have an idea.

1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:44.049
Sam.

1:11:44.133 --> 1:11:45.551
<i> Yeah, go ahead.</i>

1:11:45.634 --> 1:11:47.720
I found them.
I found the bells.

1:11:47.803 --> 1:11:50.389
You remember how George
used to be a coach
at the high school?

1:11:50.472 --> 1:11:52.057
They're right here
in the trophy case.

1:11:52.141 --> 1:11:53.851
We gotta get
a forensic kit over here
right away.

1:11:53.934 --> 1:11:55.519
<i>That's great, Terry.</i>

1:11:55.602 --> 1:11:57.062
<i>Sheriff Pierce isn't too far.</i>

1:11:57.146 --> 1:11:59.148
<i>I'll radio for him</i>
<i>to head your way.</i>

1:11:59.231 --> 1:12:00.274
Copy that.

1:12:09.283 --> 1:12:11.118
No, no. No, no, no.

1:12:17.499 --> 1:12:18.876
Something wrong?

1:12:21.503 --> 1:12:22.546
Violet?

1:12:24.506 --> 1:12:25.966
What are you doin' here?

1:12:26.050 --> 1:12:28.135
I was just looking
for the bells.

1:12:28.218 --> 1:12:29.678
What are you doing here?

1:12:31.555 --> 1:12:33.223
Same thing.

1:12:33.307 --> 1:12:36.685
I remembered that George, he...
he used to be a coach here.

1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:39.813
Yeah.

1:12:39.897 --> 1:12:41.190
He fired you, didn't he?

1:12:44.234 --> 1:12:46.987
Yeah. It was a long time ago.

1:12:47.071 --> 1:12:49.448
He didn't respect my opinions.
It...

1:12:49.531 --> 1:12:51.784
it wasn't a good fit.

1:12:51.867 --> 1:12:54.411
That must have been really
disappointing for your dad.

1:12:54.495 --> 1:12:55.954
Losing a job like that.

1:12:58.165 --> 1:12:59.541
Yeah.

1:12:59.625 --> 1:13:02.461
Well, he's gonna see
how capable I am...

1:13:02.544 --> 1:13:04.630
when I'm the one
who finds the bells.

1:13:04.713 --> 1:13:07.633
Right. You'll be the hero
when you find them.

1:13:07.716 --> 1:13:09.802
Your dad's finally
going to be proud of you.

1:13:09.885 --> 1:13:12.096
He might even make you
the new sheriff.

1:13:13.722 --> 1:13:15.974
Just doing my job.

1:13:16.058 --> 1:13:18.602
Is it your job
to frame an innocent man?

1:13:21.563 --> 1:13:24.983
George Bottoms isn't innocent.

1:13:25.067 --> 1:13:26.735
He's an ex-con.

1:13:26.819 --> 1:13:30.489
People don't change, Violet.
Once a criminal,
always a criminal.

1:13:30.572 --> 1:13:32.533
That's a funny thing
for a criminal to say.

1:13:33.659 --> 1:13:34.660
Me?

1:13:35.828 --> 1:13:37.955
I'm just investigating.

1:13:38.038 --> 1:13:41.333
And your investigation somehow
took you to the exact hiding
spot the bells were in?

1:13:41.416 --> 1:13:44.420
You were so sure,
you even told Deputy Sam
you already had them.

1:13:44.503 --> 1:13:46.547
No, no, I didn't...

1:13:46.630 --> 1:13:50.092
I... I told her that I thought
I was about to find them.

1:13:50.175 --> 1:13:52.094
That's not what I heard.

1:13:52.177 --> 1:13:55.973
Should I replay the video
I have of you going straight
to the hiding spot?

1:13:56.056 --> 1:13:57.766
<i>They're right here</i>
<i>in the trophy case.</i>

1:13:57.850 --> 1:14:00.727
<i>We gotta get a forensic kit</i>
<i>over here right away.</i>

1:14:00.811 --> 1:14:02.729
Let me have the phone, Violet.

1:14:02.813 --> 1:14:06.191
I really shouldn't.
I think this video,
the tunnel map in your car,

1:14:06.275 --> 1:14:08.777
and the two-striped sneakers
on the security camera footage

1:14:08.861 --> 1:14:13.157
are going to be all the proof
my dad needs to put you in jail
instead of Mr. Bottoms.

1:14:16.076 --> 1:14:17.369
Give me the phone.

1:14:32.926 --> 1:14:33.844
Okay.

1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:35.637
That's enough.

1:14:36.305 --> 1:14:37.306
Whoops!

1:14:42.269 --> 1:14:43.770
Don't worry.

1:14:43.854 --> 1:14:44.855
I caught it.

1:14:48.567 --> 1:14:49.902
You're making a big mistake.

1:14:49.985 --> 1:14:51.570
You're not acting like I am.

1:14:59.494 --> 1:15:00.954
The phone.

1:15:01.038 --> 1:15:02.039
Please.

1:15:02.122 --> 1:15:03.415
I don't have it.

1:15:05.375 --> 1:15:07.211
I'm done playing games
with you guys.

1:15:07.294 --> 1:15:08.378
Looking for this?

1:15:23.435 --> 1:15:25.229
Harrison, stop!

1:15:46.458 --> 1:15:48.710
Looks like
you dropped something.

1:15:50.754 --> 1:15:52.547
-Kenny, now!
-Got it!

1:15:57.219 --> 1:15:58.637
Let me out!

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:00.055
We heard Sheriff Pierce
is on his way.

1:16:00.138 --> 1:16:02.599
We can let you out then.

1:16:02.683 --> 1:16:04.017
I'm just gonna
destroy this phone.

1:16:04.101 --> 1:16:06.103
-And the video that's on it.
-Go ahead.

1:16:06.186 --> 1:16:07.646
We already have
the video of you going straight
to the bells' hiding spot

1:16:07.729 --> 1:16:09.314
on the phone my brother has.

1:16:12.234 --> 1:16:14.111
Hey! Let me out!

1:16:49.271 --> 1:16:51.398
Does this
have anything to do
with the missing jingle bells?

1:16:51.481 --> 1:16:53.191
Deputy Donovan...

1:16:53.275 --> 1:16:54.693
-Come on, guys, back off.
--Deputy, do you have
anything to say?

1:16:54.776 --> 1:16:55.861
I'll have a statement
for you tomorrow.

1:16:55.944 --> 1:16:56.903
...George Bottoms?

1:16:56.987 --> 1:16:58.447
Okay.

1:17:06.621 --> 1:17:08.206
I thought I told you
to stand down.

1:17:08.290 --> 1:17:11.293
I know, Dad, but he was messing
with your investigation,

1:17:11.376 --> 1:17:13.211
and he was your deputy.

1:17:13.295 --> 1:17:14.421
How could you have known?

1:17:14.504 --> 1:17:16.506
I couldn't let him do that.

1:17:18.550 --> 1:17:20.844
I'm not sure
how you guys did this.

1:17:22.012 --> 1:17:24.014
I'm not sure you want to know.

1:17:27.809 --> 1:17:29.353
I had a lot of help.

1:17:30.354 --> 1:17:31.605
I stepped on the glass.

1:17:32.314 --> 1:17:33.357
Is that right?

1:17:34.316 --> 1:17:36.068
I broke into the museum.

1:17:37.527 --> 1:17:39.529
I was the getaway driver.

1:17:39.613 --> 1:17:41.114
Yeah.

1:17:41.198 --> 1:17:43.116
Everyone pitched in, Dad.

1:17:47.996 --> 1:17:49.706
I'd better take those.

1:17:52.584 --> 1:17:55.837
And we will talk about this
when we get home.

1:17:57.297 --> 1:17:58.298
But...

1:17:59.299 --> 1:18:01.843
you guys did good.

1:18:01.927 --> 1:18:04.596
<i> Let me tell you</i>
<i>the tale of Violet Pierce</i>

1:18:04.679 --> 1:18:07.182
<i>and the golden jingle bells.</i>

1:18:07.265 --> 1:18:11.770
<i>The magic of the bells</i>
<i>went beyond just a wish</i>
<i>that year.</i>

1:18:13.230 --> 1:18:15.690
I'm sorry you had to
go through this, George.

1:18:15.774 --> 1:18:16.900
It's okay, Grant.

1:18:16.983 --> 1:18:18.610
-You're just doing your job.
-Yeah.

1:18:29.371 --> 1:18:32.624
<i> They gave a chance</i>
<i>at reconciliation.</i>

1:18:37.462 --> 1:18:39.047
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

1:18:40.424 --> 1:18:41.508
It's okay.

1:18:43.051 --> 1:18:44.803
I love you, son.

1:18:44.886 --> 1:18:46.972
I love you too, Dad.

1:18:47.055 --> 1:18:49.224
Come on. Come here. Come here.

1:18:54.187 --> 1:18:57.691
<i> They offered</i>
<i>an important wake up call.</i>

1:18:58.859 --> 1:19:01.403
You, um...

1:19:01.486 --> 1:19:05.323
you did all of this
because George Bottoms
fired you 18 years ago?

1:19:05.407 --> 1:19:08.577
I wanted to do something...
something big.

1:19:08.660 --> 1:19:10.495
-Something... something...
-Something big?

1:19:10.579 --> 1:19:13.123
Something to make you
finally notice me.

1:19:13.206 --> 1:19:15.250
I'm sorry, Dad.

1:19:15.333 --> 1:19:20.172
No, no. I'm sorry, son,
if I made you feel you needed
to do something like this.

1:19:22.883 --> 1:19:24.885
I just want you
to be proud of me.

1:19:26.553 --> 1:19:27.971
Oh, son.

1:19:29.181 --> 1:19:31.600
You're gonna get
through this, okay?

1:19:33.435 --> 1:19:35.353
I'm here with you.

1:19:36.771 --> 1:19:38.690
Okay.

1:19:38.773 --> 1:19:42.068
<i> They allowed a chance</i>
<i>to move through</i>
<i>a difficult memory.</i>

1:19:42.152 --> 1:19:44.321
Oh, boy.

1:19:44.404 --> 1:19:45.655
Look at you.

1:19:47.532 --> 1:19:49.201
It's one of Maddie's
old dresses.

1:19:49.284 --> 1:19:53.288
Hmm. Well, that is...
that is lovely on you.

1:19:53.371 --> 1:19:55.624
Maddie said
I remind her of Mom.

1:19:58.043 --> 1:20:00.504
Oh, yeah. Wow.

1:20:02.756 --> 1:20:04.049
You sure do.

1:20:05.133 --> 1:20:08.011
Uh, you are, um...

1:20:08.094 --> 1:20:12.474
You are funny,
and you are kind, and so smart.

1:20:12.557 --> 1:20:14.309
-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

1:20:16.436 --> 1:20:18.188
You know who else
you remind me of?

1:20:18.271 --> 1:20:19.272
Who?

1:20:19.940 --> 1:20:21.441
Me.

1:20:21.525 --> 1:20:23.985
You won't let anyone tell you
what to do or how to behave,

1:20:24.069 --> 1:20:26.696
or when to take "no"
for an answer.

1:20:28.657 --> 1:20:30.992
You got a little bit
of both of us...

1:20:33.161 --> 1:20:34.329
and it's perfect.

1:20:36.373 --> 1:20:38.250
I love you, honey.

1:20:38.333 --> 1:20:39.459
I love you too, Dad.

1:20:46.550 --> 1:20:47.801
Hey, Maddie.

1:20:47.884 --> 1:20:49.469
-<i> Even planting seeds...</i>
-Hey.

1:20:49.553 --> 1:20:52.013
<i>...of love for new</i>
<i>relationships to blossom.</i>

1:20:52.889 --> 1:20:56.309
Thank you for everything.

1:20:56.393 --> 1:20:57.686
Me?

1:20:57.769 --> 1:21:00.814
I mean, you're the one
who found the tunnel map.

1:21:00.897 --> 1:21:02.691
You gave me
a reason to believe.

1:21:05.151 --> 1:21:06.319
This is for you.

1:21:07.362 --> 1:21:08.572
To say thanks.

1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:12.075
-For me?
-Yeah.

1:21:15.203 --> 1:21:17.163
I mean, you don't have to
put coffee in it

1:21:17.247 --> 1:21:19.040
if you don't want, but...

1:21:35.348 --> 1:21:37.517
<i> Young or old,</i>
<i>believer or not,</i>

1:21:37.601 --> 1:21:39.769
<i>no matter</i>
<i>who you were that year,</i>

1:21:39.853 --> 1:21:45.900
<i>you were forever changed</i>
<i>by the magic of Santa's</i>
<i>golden jingle bells.</i>

1:21:50.030 --> 1:21:51.281
Just in case.

1:21:51.364 --> 1:21:53.491
<i> And the town</i>
<i>of Pleasant Bay</i>

1:21:53.575 --> 1:21:58.121
still celebrates the Ringing
of the Bells ceremony
every year on Christmas Eve.

1:21:58.204 --> 1:22:00.123
Fiona! It's time.

1:22:00.206 --> 1:22:01.708
Sorry.

1:22:01.791 --> 1:22:03.835
I just love telling the story
of the bells.

1:22:03.918 --> 1:22:05.754
I gotta go.

1:22:05.837 --> 1:22:09.382
Welcome, everyone,
to the 100th anniversary

1:22:09.466 --> 1:22:11.343
of the Ringing of the Bells!

1:22:18.808 --> 1:22:22.312
Tonight, the honors go
to a young lady

1:22:22.395 --> 1:22:24.397
without whom,
ladies and gentlemen,

1:22:24.481 --> 1:22:26.650
frankly, we would not be here.

1:22:26.733 --> 1:22:27.984
Violet Pierce.

1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:36.201
And now...

1:22:37.786 --> 1:22:39.621
The Ringing of the Bells!

1:22:48.380 --> 1:22:49.756
You made this happen.

1:22:55.637 --> 1:22:57.430
Deputy Violet...

1:22:57.514 --> 1:22:58.723
do your duty.

1:22:58.807 --> 1:23:00.684
With honor, Sheriff Pierce.

1:23:00.767 --> 1:23:02.102
Attagirl, Violet!

1:23:04.312 --> 1:23:05.271
Yo, get ready.

1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:11.361
-Merry Christmas, everyone!
