00:01.168 --> 00:02.586
<i>Previously on Designated Survivor...</i>

00:02.711 --> 00:05.297
Sir, you don't really think
Aaron's a traitor, do you?

00:05.423 --> 00:07.466
No, I don't. But until I can
prove that definitively,

00:07.591 --> 00:09.844
I have to keep my guard up
and so do you.

00:09.969 --> 00:11.512
What happened last night?

00:11.637 --> 00:14.640
We had the shooter contained,
but MacLeish gave the order anyway.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.475
- What order?
- Shoot to kill.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.269
And that's for your ears only.

00:18.811 --> 00:20.813
- We need your help.
- You want to help me?

00:20.938 --> 00:22.606
Find my son!

00:23.107 --> 00:25.317
- <i>It's Joyner. He wants to see you.</i>
- Why?

00:25.443 --> 00:27.486
<i>The FBI came to see him again today.</i>

00:27.611 --> 00:30.114
The guy just needs some reassurance.
I can give it to him.

00:30.239 --> 00:33.284
But if it doesn't work,
the problem has to be eliminated.

00:33.409 --> 00:35.536
- Someone's gonna find out.
- Yes, you lied.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.538
- I lied to Congress.
- That's it. Go.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.832
FBI! Freeze!
Put your hands on your head.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.501
I'm the Vice President
of the United States.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.922
No!

00:50.301 --> 00:52.678
<i>From ABC7 News,</i>

00:52.803 --> 00:54.513
<i>this is a breaking news alert.</i>

00:54.638 --> 00:56.348
<i>Good morning from ABC7.</i>

00:56.474 --> 00:58.726
<i>We have breaking news
from Arlington National Cemetery.</i>

00:58.851 --> 01:00.811
<i>The U.S. Army and FBI
are investigating</i>

01:00.936 --> 01:02.730
<i>a deadly shooting
that occurred last night.</i>

01:02.855 --> 01:04.899
<i>The Washington Post is reporting
that two victims are involved.</i>

01:05.024 --> 01:06.067
Emily Rhodes.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.206
Aaron Shore.

01:20.331 --> 01:22.041
Someone's gonna have
to explain to me

01:22.166 --> 01:24.543
how the Vice President
of the United States of America

01:24.668 --> 01:26.921
was murdered in front
of a team of federal agents!

01:27.046 --> 01:29.173
We didn't pick the meeting place, sir.
MacLeish did.

01:29.298 --> 01:30.674
We had to take cover where we could.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.176
And MacLeish's security detail
was instructed

01:32.301 --> 01:34.512
to give him plenty of buffer
so he'd feel secure.

01:34.637 --> 01:36.013
We would've taken him down
if it weren't for Beth MacLeish.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.556
I'm sorry. I missed it.

01:37.681 --> 01:41.185
Beth MacLeish was the joker in the deck.
I didn't think she could be involved.

01:41.310 --> 01:44.396
Do we know how she got away
from <i>her</i> Secret Service detail?

01:44.522 --> 01:47.108
She said she was going to read to
her children. That was her routine.

01:47.233 --> 01:49.735
By the time they figured out
she was missing, it was too late.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.071
Mr. President, there are only
a few scenarios at play here,

01:52.196 --> 01:54.949
but only one rings true:
Beth MacLeish was involved.

01:55.074 --> 01:56.992
She knew we were there
to arrest her husband,

01:57.118 --> 01:59.078
and she murdered him
before we could interrogate him.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.378
What kind of fanatics
are we dealing with here?

02:07.503 --> 02:10.589
Sir, it's only a matter of time
before the press pieces together

02:10.714 --> 02:12.591
their own version
of what happened tonight.

02:12.716 --> 02:16.428
It's imperative we keep
as many details out of the public realm

02:16.554 --> 02:18.430
to protect the integrity
of our investigation.

02:18.556 --> 02:19.557
I understand.

02:20.891 --> 02:24.103
So what do we tell the American people?

02:31.861 --> 02:33.946
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.323
- Damn it, no cufflinks.
- Use paper clips.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.284
- What?
- I'm serious.

02:38.409 --> 02:40.703
- Any idea who got shot?
- Not a clue.

02:43.247 --> 02:44.623
I know.

02:44.748 --> 02:47.793
It's shocking,
but we need to move past this.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.753
Does anyone need
to take a moment?

02:51.922 --> 02:54.049
Okay, good. Because we're
in a race against the clock.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.051
The country is gonna wake up
to the news

02:56.177 --> 02:58.137
that their Vice President
was murdered by his wife,

02:58.262 --> 03:00.639
- who then killed herself.
- Do we know why she did it?

03:00.764 --> 03:01.807
No, not really.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.310
Right now, the working theory is
problems in the marriage.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.937
A domestic dispute?
I don't believe it.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.607
Unfortunately, it's the only explanation
investigators are willing to give

03:09.732 --> 03:12.443
until they know more.
I will make the announcement.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.612
Sir, facing the press
with only preliminary theories

03:14.737 --> 03:16.030
is like dropping blood in the water.

03:16.155 --> 03:18.032
And the timing alone
is gonna raise questions.

03:18.157 --> 03:19.617
Somebody just tried to kill you,

03:19.742 --> 03:21.660
and now the Vice President
gets murdered by his wife?

03:21.785 --> 03:23.829
Yeah, the press will be
all over you for more details.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.332
- Let me make a statement.
- No, this news,

03:26.457 --> 03:28.042
the country needs to hear
from their president.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.669
Sir, I have to point out
that Speaker Hookstraten's now

03:30.794 --> 03:32.296
next in line to the presidency.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.797
Right.

03:33.923 --> 03:35.883
I'll talk to Kimble
at the appropriate time.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.219
For now, bring her up to speed
with what we know.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.679
These next few days
are going to be crucial.

03:40.804 --> 03:44.683
I need you to hold yourselves together,
project strength.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.186
The American people deserve
nothing less.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.688
- Let's get to work.
- Yes, sir.

04:14.296 --> 04:16.005
This is surreal--

04:16.130 --> 04:17.548
MacLeish, Beth.

04:17.675 --> 04:21.345
What about their kids?
I mean, what about those poor girls?

04:21.470 --> 04:23.472
I know.
I feel awful about the children.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.724
You know what happened, don't you?

04:26.350 --> 04:28.852
But you can't tell me, can you?

04:28.978 --> 04:31.397
No. Not yet. Hopefully soon.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.524
- Dad!
- Little pea!

04:34.233 --> 04:36.443
Hey, watch out. Mind your dad.

04:36.568 --> 04:37.444
You okay?

04:37.569 --> 04:39.905
Yeah. I'm all right.
What do you got there?

04:40.030 --> 04:42.700
I can't draw a horse.
Will you help me?

04:42.825 --> 04:45.577
Of course.
But I've got some work to do.

04:45.703 --> 04:46.912
I'll help you in a minute.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.039
- Promise?
- Pinky swear.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.919
Come on.
Let's get you some breakfast.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.379
Hey!

04:55.504 --> 04:57.047
Aren't you forgetting something?

05:00.092 --> 05:02.344
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.057
No, that's not actually what I said.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.435
I would just refer you back
to my original statement, okay?

05:10.519 --> 05:12.771
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

05:15.441 --> 05:18.444
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you...

05:18.569 --> 05:21.071
Please, take your seats.

05:21.196 --> 05:25.743
I wish I were here to simply talk to you
about my returning to the White House

05:25.868 --> 05:29.163
and expressing my gratitude
to the medical staff

05:29.288 --> 05:31.332
at the George Washington
University Hospital

05:31.457 --> 05:36.295
and to the American people
for their incredible support.

05:36.920 --> 05:41.550
But unfortunately, I have a more
somber and serious obligation.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.802
There has been a great deal
of speculation

05:43.927 --> 05:46.805
surrounding the police activity
at Arlington National Cemetery

05:46.930 --> 05:48.974
from last night until this morning.

05:49.933 --> 05:53.479
I am here to tell you
that tragically, at 10:38 p.m.,

05:53.604 --> 05:55.689
Vice President Peter MacLeish

05:55.814 --> 05:58.984
was shot and killed by his wife,
Beth MacLeish.

06:00.903 --> 06:04.615
She then turned the gun
upon herself and committed suicide.

06:05.991 --> 06:09.453
The Vice President was visiting
the gravesite of a soldier

06:09.578 --> 06:12.122
who was under his command
in Afghanistan.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.833
Why he was there last night
specifically,

06:14.958 --> 06:17.669
how often he visited the cemetery,

06:17.795 --> 06:21.548
and what led to this fatal outcome
is still unknown.

06:23.258 --> 06:26.178
I would like to say,
I know that the American people

06:26.303 --> 06:29.348
will join me
in sending their hopes and prayers

06:29.473 --> 06:32.810
to the MacLeish family
during this time of sorrow.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.396
Thank you very much.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.066
All right, folks,
that's all we have for now, okay?

06:39.191 --> 06:40.859
The President's obviously not
taking any questions.

06:40.984 --> 06:44.947
Look, I'm gonna be updating you
every hour as we have new developments.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.412
Yvette...

07:34.580 --> 07:35.914
I'm so sorry.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.541
Thank you.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.420
One second.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.424
I don't know what to say.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.385
Thank you for coming.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.056
He was such an amazing boy, Jason.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.352
And they took him from us.

08:06.570 --> 08:07.946
Hey.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.406
What's the press saying
about the shooting?

08:09.531 --> 08:10.824
What aren't they saying?

08:10.949 --> 08:13.452
Speculation's everywhere,
but Seth has it handled.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.245
How's the staff holding up?

08:15.704 --> 08:17.456
They're shocked, but pulling through.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.917
One thing that helps is
seeing you on your feet again.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.002
- Welcome back, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Hayden.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.420
See?

08:23.545 --> 08:25.422
We should discuss
the rest of your day's agenda.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.425
- I thought we canceled everything.
- We can't have a bunker mentality.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.760
The world's still spinning.

08:29.885 --> 08:32.346
You're absolutely right.
What do you got?

08:32.471 --> 08:34.347
Well, CEOs are arriving as we speak

08:34.472 --> 08:36.975
to discuss reducing
carbon dioxide emissions later today.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.144
You're also set to meet
with Senators Choi and Ganesh

08:39.269 --> 08:41.355
- regarding criminal justice reform.
- Okay. What else?

08:41.480 --> 08:43.649
Jacklyn Ramsey just
turned us down for Interior,

08:43.774 --> 08:45.192
said she's happy at the NRDC.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.320
How many people
do we have to approach

08:48.445 --> 08:50.155
to get someone
to even take a meeting?

08:50.280 --> 08:51.615
Well, we saw this
during the elections.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.825
People just don't want to be
in Washington right now.

08:53.951 --> 08:55.327
Any good news?

08:55.452 --> 08:57.454
Actually, Gary Dwyer's
still set to come in tomorrow

08:57.579 --> 09:00.332
to meet with Aaron about resuming
his post as Secretary of State.

09:00.457 --> 09:01.500
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

09:01.625 --> 09:02.626
Dwyer.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.170
That'll go a long way
to shoring up confidence.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.381
Yes, it would.
But about their meeting, sir.

09:07.506 --> 09:09.466
I was wondering,
in light of recent events,

09:09.591 --> 09:12.135
if you thought I should sit down
with Dwyer instead of Aaron.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.346
Emily, I understand your concern,

09:14.471 --> 09:17.474
but until I find a reason to make
a change, it's business as usual.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.643
Understood.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.523
The MacLeishes leave behind
two daughters, Lexi and Blake,

09:24.648 --> 09:26.358
who will be staying
with their maternal grandparents.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.820
We ask that you would respect
their privacy in their time of grieving.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.655
The President will
address the nation further

09:31.780 --> 09:33.657
when he has more information
available, okay?

09:33.782 --> 09:36.159
That's all I have for now, unless
you have questions about something.

09:36.285 --> 09:38.203
Mr. Press Secretary!

09:38.328 --> 09:39.705
Mr. Press Secretary!!

09:40.163 --> 09:43.208
Mr. Leonard. A pleasure
to have you back at the White House.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.669
I hope that's the first lie
you told this morning.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.546
May I ask who you're with?

09:47.671 --> 09:49.881
<i>Teen Mode.</i>

09:50.007 --> 09:52.217
Come on, Abe. I need to know
who your credentials are with.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.302
<i>Teen Mode.</i>

09:53.719 --> 09:55.887
They actually do real stories
on real issues,

09:56.013 --> 09:57.389
unlike these lemmings.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.557
All right, Abe.

09:58.682 --> 09:59.850
You have a question?

09:59.975 --> 10:02.060
Yeah, it's about Nestor Lozano,

10:02.185 --> 10:04.563
President Kirkman's
would-be assassin.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.607
Sure, the FBI released
a statement on Lozano last night.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.025
Which told us virtually nothing.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.235
Now, I have it on good authority
that Vice President MacLeish

10:10.360 --> 10:12.946
personally took over the manhunt
for Lozano

10:13.071 --> 10:15.907
and issued a shoot-to-kill order.
Care to comment?

10:16.033 --> 10:17.909
I would refer you back
to the FBI comm shop.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.369
I'm not aware of any such order.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.747
Really? Well, my sources say
MacLeish overrode the FBI,

10:21.872 --> 10:25.208
deliberately preventing them
from taking Lozano alive.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.294
Why would the Vice President do that?

10:27.419 --> 10:30.881
I mean, why would he go out of his way
to silence the one man

10:31.006 --> 10:32.633
who attempted to murder the president?

10:32.758 --> 10:34.801
I mean, it doesn't make sense,
unless...

10:34.926 --> 10:38.055
MacLeish wanted him silenced.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.933
I'll have to get back to you on that.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.728
I'd appreciate that.

10:48.899 --> 10:51.902
How did Abe Leonard
get the information in the first place?

10:52.027 --> 10:54.112
- Wait, it's true? MacLeish gave the order?
- Yes.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.114
I advised against it,
but he didn't listen to me.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.283
- Or the FBI.
- What was he thinking?

10:58.408 --> 11:00.452
He said he didn't want
to put our men at risk.

11:00.577 --> 11:01.453
Okay. Uh, well...

11:01.578 --> 11:03.121
Leonard said
MacLeish was hiding something.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.289
- Was he?
- I don't know,

11:04.414 --> 11:07.125
but now I have a room full of White
House correspondents looking into it.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.753
Look, we need to contain this now,
before paranoia takes over.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.255
And I want to know who's leaking
classified information.

11:12.381 --> 11:15.092
Emily, Aaron, you were both in Command Ops
when MacLeish gave the order.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.427
Find the leak.
I want them in my office by nightfall.

11:17.552 --> 11:18.553
Yes, sir.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.264
Seth, can I borrow you for a second?

11:24.726 --> 11:26.436
I want to address the nation.

11:27.104 --> 11:29.106
Sir, I'm not sure that's the best idea.

11:29.606 --> 11:30.524
I mean, you just announced

11:30.649 --> 11:32.776
that the vice president
was murdered by his wife.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.986
I don't think the country's
ready to hear this after that.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.947
The country deserves to know
what's happening.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.533
Sir, no matter what your intent,

11:39.658 --> 11:41.785
I think that anything
that you say at this point

11:41.910 --> 11:43.954
could contribute to a sense of chaos.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.333
Why don't you let me buy you some time?
Wait for this news cycle to die down.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.378
That way, when you do say something,
it's proactive instead of just reacting

11:51.503 --> 11:53.213
to some flame-throwing reporter.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.465
Okay, you're right.
You're right. Get it done.

11:58.093 --> 11:59.302
Thank you.

11:59.428 --> 12:02.472
- So what couldn't wait?
- Abe Leonard...

12:02.973 --> 12:04.808
I know you two go way back.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.893
You told him about MacLeish
taking out the shooter

12:07.018 --> 12:08.395
in Command Ops... don't deny it.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.689
Okay, I won't.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.234
- I told you that in confidence.
- That was your mistake.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.570
I thought you were working
with the President on this.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.071
I am.

12:18.196 --> 12:19.906
He asked me to look into MacLeish,

12:20.031 --> 12:21.408
and that's exactly what I'm doing;

12:21.533 --> 12:24.661
- trying to do my job as best I can.
- All right.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.038
You can dress this up
however you like, Madam Speaker,

12:27.164 --> 12:29.040
but you just jeopardized
national security.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.793
Actually, Aaron <i>... you</i> did.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.761
Those are NASAMS, ma'am,
surface-to-air missiles.

12:40.886 --> 12:44.097
They were there before.
We're just installing more.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.141
And there's more snipers.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.060
It's all part
of the increased security plan.

12:50.312 --> 12:52.606
It's just for the moment.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.357
Just for the moment.

12:54.858 --> 12:55.901
Yes, ma'am.

12:57.319 --> 12:58.528
Anything else?

12:59.029 --> 13:00.739
No. Thanks, Mike.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.039
You're the leak?

13:09.164 --> 13:10.415
Indirectly, sir.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.543
I told Speaker Hookstraten.
She fed the story to Abe Leonard.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.297
I realize, sir, this couldn't come at a...

13:17.422 --> 13:19.382
at a worse possible time.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.885
It was a lapse in judgment.

13:22.385 --> 13:23.762
And I apologize.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.014
It won't happen again.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.893
- Now, I could put out a statement.
- No, no, no.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.937
That'll only add fuel to the fire.

13:32.062 --> 13:34.272
With all the rumors that are
floating around right now,

13:34.397 --> 13:36.441
the last thing we need
is the press to find out

13:36.566 --> 13:38.276
that my Chief of Staff
leaked classified information.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.237
No, of course not.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.538
Aaron?

13:50.080 --> 13:52.249
When is the last time you slept?

13:53.583 --> 13:55.126
I-I slept last night, sir.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.586
More than three hours?

14:00.048 --> 14:03.051
You said yourself
you made a lapse in judgment.

14:03.802 --> 14:06.263
Exhaustion affects
our ability to make decisions.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.056
Maybe you need some personal time.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.102
Sir, are you asking me to step aside?

14:12.227 --> 14:15.063
Absolutely not.
I'm asking you to get some rest.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.649
Take maybe a week.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.484
Come back recharged.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.654
Look, sir, I appreciate
you looking after me like that,

14:22.779 --> 14:24.614
but with everything
that's going on right now,

14:24.739 --> 14:26.366
I really don't think
a break is called for.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.201
Aaron, it's because
of everything that's going on

14:28.326 --> 14:30.245
that I need you at your best.

14:31.121 --> 14:34.165
I'm not trying to punish you.
I'm trying to protect you.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.126
You're gonna have to trust me.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.462
Take the week.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.093
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.198
Aaron told me himself.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.534
He shared the information
with Speaker Hookstraten;

15:09.659 --> 15:11.494
she leaked it to Abe Leonard.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.164
Wow.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.750
Do you think
this has anything to do

15:16.875 --> 15:19.002
with him suppressing
the threat assessment memo?

15:19.127 --> 15:20.879
No. No, I don't.

15:22.005 --> 15:25.050
- But he's gonna take some time off.
- You suspended him?

15:25.175 --> 15:26.885
No, I asked him
to get some rest and refocus,

15:27.010 --> 15:29.262
give us a chance to figure out
what the hell is going on.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.139
In the meantime...

15:32.015 --> 15:34.517
I would like you
to be my acting Chief of Staff.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.898
I'm throwing you in the deep end here.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.692
I won't let you down.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.028
I know.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.530
Thank you, Emily.
Ava will bring you up to speed.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.416
I guess that's all I need for
the next briefing. Thank you, guys.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.210
Uh, hey, Seth.

16:00.335 --> 16:03.129
My mother called me earlier.
She asked me two questions.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.131
One... am I dating anyone?

16:05.256 --> 16:08.301
Two: was the Vice President involved
with the attempt on Kirkman's life?

16:08.426 --> 16:10.720
- Funny.
- I'm serious.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.764
When's the President gonna address this?

16:12.889 --> 16:15.392
He's right, Seth.
The longer we stay silent,

16:15.517 --> 16:17.394
the more it seems
like we are hiding something.

16:17.519 --> 16:20.438
Okay. Well, look. The President is
still being briefed by the FBI,

16:20.563 --> 16:22.440
and he should have
all the information he needs

16:22.565 --> 16:25.276
before he can address the nation, right?
Thanks for that question.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.444
Yeah.

16:28.071 --> 16:29.072
Laura?

16:33.576 --> 16:34.911
We, um...

16:35.036 --> 16:36.913
We need to shut down Abe Leonard

16:37.038 --> 16:39.457
before his conspiracy rumors
get out of hand.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.418
Abe Leonard's a Pulitzer Prize-winner.

16:41.543 --> 16:43.628
Well, he's a disgraced
Pulitzer Prize-winner, right?

16:44.087 --> 16:46.965
You know, when firefighters are
trying to put out a forest fire,

16:47.090 --> 16:48.466
sometimes they'll...

16:48.591 --> 16:50.927
set a backfire
to snuff out the original blaze.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.303
That's what we need to do.

16:52.429 --> 16:53.847
So... you want us to smear him?

16:53.972 --> 16:56.224
No, the President doesn't want that,
and neither do I.

16:57.225 --> 17:01.021
What I do want is for the American people
to realize that, uh...

17:01.146 --> 17:03.940
Abe Leonard strikes out
more than he hits home runs.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.318
Make our friends in the media
remember every correction,

17:07.444 --> 17:09.194
retraction he's ever had to publish,

17:09.319 --> 17:12.449
every libel lawsuit
and defamation settlement.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.367
I mean, this guy's
like a broken watch, right?

17:15.492 --> 17:18.246
- He's only right twice a day.
- Sweet.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.457
We finally get to spin something.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.799
Hey, here's a list

17:29.924 --> 17:32.510
of pending correspondence
and calls to return.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.471
These will catch you up on NSA,

17:34.596 --> 17:38.016
and these are the files
for the Dwyer meeting tomorrow.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.018
I'm sorry, Aaron.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.103
There's nothing to be sorry about.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.898
The President's
just looking out for me.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.983
And I'm sure
you'll be back in no time.

17:49.277 --> 17:51.529
Curtis is the go-to guy
for all matters Senate,

17:51.654 --> 17:53.156
and Jamie for the House.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.867
Denise handles military and cabinet.

17:56.618 --> 17:57.660
Aaron...

18:01.706 --> 18:02.874
Good luck.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.552
You sure you don't want me
in there with you?

18:14.677 --> 18:16.179
No. Joyner knows me.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.515
Yeah, he knows you're the one
who took down MacLeish,

18:18.640 --> 18:20.391
the only guy in the world he trusted.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.061
Look, he's damaged goods.
I can reach him.

18:24.062 --> 18:27.190
The story of this conspiracy
starts in Afghanistan.

18:27.315 --> 18:29.859
Until we understand that,
we don't understand anything.

18:42.247 --> 18:44.124
"And you will know the truth,

18:44.249 --> 18:46.543
and the truth will set you free."

18:47.418 --> 18:48.586
John 8:32.

18:48.711 --> 18:51.422
That's what you quoted to MacLeish
right before he was shot.

18:51.548 --> 18:54.050
So what is the truth, Corporal Joyner?

18:54.175 --> 18:56.344
Tell me about the mission to Kunar.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.555
November 14, 2005.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.891
I ain't talking to you.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.734
The CIA added this
to your mission file.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.573
This is total crap.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.616
It didn't happen like this.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.662
This makes us sound like baby killers.

19:22.787 --> 19:25.915
But you did kill civilians, didn't you?

19:26.457 --> 19:29.127
Women? Children?

19:29.460 --> 19:30.962
You weren't there!

19:31.087 --> 19:32.755
You can't understand.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.259
Make me understand.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.595
Listen to your conscience, Alvin.

19:38.720 --> 19:39.929
I can't.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.307
You want to tell someone.
I know you do.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.308
No!

19:43.766 --> 19:45.768
- Cap said--
- Captain MacLeish is dead

19:45.894 --> 19:47.937
and he's going down
as a war criminal.

19:48.271 --> 19:49.147
No!

19:49.939 --> 19:51.399
H-He's a hero!

19:51.816 --> 19:54.277
He saved all of us that day.

19:56.321 --> 19:58.948
How? What did he do?

20:12.837 --> 20:14.047
Hey.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.757
Hey.

20:17.425 --> 20:18.635
Everything all right?

20:19.135 --> 20:20.386
Yeah.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.972
T-Tom, I'm worried about the kids.

20:23.473 --> 20:26.059
I think we should send them away
from the White House.

20:26.184 --> 20:27.518
What?

20:27.644 --> 20:29.896
My mom can help take care of them.
I spoke with her.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.315
- With all due respect to your mom--
- Just hear me out, okay?

20:32.440 --> 20:33.733
The people who are behind this,

20:33.858 --> 20:35.526
they took down the government,

20:35.652 --> 20:38.071
th-they killed
that FBI agent's little boy,

20:38.196 --> 20:41.074
- and they almost killed you.
- Slow down. Slow down.

20:41.199 --> 20:44.327
You said yourself you thought the White
House was the safest place to be.

20:44.452 --> 20:47.789
Well, I was wrong. Because
wherever you are, you are a target.

20:48.831 --> 20:51.084
Well, where do you want to go?

20:51.209 --> 20:53.836
I spoke with Mike about Camp David.

20:53.962 --> 20:56.214
- He says it's more secure.
- Of course it is.

20:56.339 --> 20:59.342
It's a compound in the middle of nowhere.
They wouldn't have any friends.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.719
They'd have to be tutored.
What kind of a life is that?

21:01.844 --> 21:03.054
What kind of life is this?

21:03.846 --> 21:06.099
- You haven't been to their school, you--
- We'll boost their security.

21:06.224 --> 21:08.101
- We'll get them tracking bands. We'll--
- No, no, no.

21:08.226 --> 21:10.687
Putting more bars on the prison
is not the answer.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.273
I want our kids
to have a normal life.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.441
And I don't want to be away from them.

21:15.566 --> 21:16.985
Or you, Al--

21:18.736 --> 21:20.029
Alex...

21:20.405 --> 21:22.448
This family, our family,

21:22.573 --> 21:24.784
is the only thing
holding me together.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.577
I know. I know that.

21:26.703 --> 21:30.039
And I don't want to be away
from you, either.

21:30.581 --> 21:34.252
But... we have to think
about what's best for them.

21:35.378 --> 21:38.381
And separating them
from their father is the answer?

21:40.508 --> 21:41.759
I'm sorry, sir.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.348
I'll get back as soon as I can.

21:53.938 --> 21:56.441
I'm gonna head home to shower
and get a change of clothes.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.901
- Please do.
- Don't miss me too much.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.284
Don't make a sound!

22:06.409 --> 22:08.494
Okay. Uh...
you want my wallet?

22:08.619 --> 22:09.954
No. I want your suit.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.081
Is that a Welsh & Jeffries?

22:13.124 --> 22:15.126
Oh, you guys are sons of bitches,
you know that?

22:15.251 --> 22:16.502
And what about me?

22:16.627 --> 22:19.297
You gave birth to these two.

22:20.423 --> 22:22.175
Oh, man.
What are you guys doing here?

22:22.300 --> 22:25.428
Well, you haven't answered
a single text message in the past week.

22:25.553 --> 22:28.681
Yeah, well... that's what happens
when the President gets shot

22:28.806 --> 22:30.683
and the Vice President
gets murdered by his wife.

22:30.808 --> 22:32.018
That's why we're here.

22:32.143 --> 22:34.020
- Call it an intervention.
- With alcohol.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.646
I wish I could, guys.

22:35.772 --> 22:38.858
- I got to shower and head back to work.
- Oh, would you listen to this guy?

22:38.983 --> 22:41.319
You sound like a freshman
all over again.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.988
Callie flew in from New York
just to see you.

22:44.113 --> 22:45.990
- You did?
- If it makes it any easier,

22:46.115 --> 22:48.785
drinks are on you.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.746
- All right. I can do one drink.
- All right.

22:52.330 --> 22:53.998
I can't believe Callie
braved the flight

22:54.123 --> 22:56.125
from New York
all the way down to D.C.

22:57.502 --> 22:59.170
Mr. President,
what I'm about to tell you

22:59.295 --> 23:01.464
came straight
from Corporal Joyner himself.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.467
One the morning of 11/14,
orders came down

23:04.592 --> 23:06.636
for MacLeish's unit
to escort an Army major

23:06.761 --> 23:09.055
to a covert meet
with an Afghan warlord.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.723
That major's name:

23:10.848 --> 23:13.226
Nestor Lozano, a.k.a. Catalan.

23:13.351 --> 23:15.978
- The man who tried to kill me.
- Right.

23:16.687 --> 23:19.482
He was meant to deliver
a few duffel bags full of cash.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.484
The meet went south,
warlord took the money

23:21.609 --> 23:24.320
and ordered his men to open fire.
It was a bloodbath.

23:24.445 --> 23:25.738
My God.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.865
MacLeish managed
to keep his unit together,

23:27.990 --> 23:30.993
and they fought their way out of
the compound, but the warlord pursued.

23:31.119 --> 23:34.622
And they started picking off the unit,
one by one.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.208
MacLeish's men went blood-simple.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.710
They shot up everything
in their path:

23:39.836 --> 23:43.131
hostiles, friendlies,
women, and children.

23:43.631 --> 23:46.551
To MacLeish's men, the rules of engagement
no longer applied.

23:46.676 --> 23:49.053
It was a frenzy: kill or be killed.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.056
Eventually, Joyner sees Lozano,

23:52.181 --> 23:55.101
shoves a gun in his face,
demands to know what happened.

23:55.226 --> 23:58.020
Lozano admits he's a CIA officer

23:58.146 --> 24:00.898
and that the bags were filled
with $5 million in cash;

24:01.023 --> 24:02.900
a payoff to fight against the Taliban.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.903
But MacLeish's men decided
that Lozano was going

24:06.028 --> 24:08.281
to have to pay
for the buddies they lost.

24:08.406 --> 24:12.076
MacLeish jumps in, stops it,
says that he was just following orders.

24:12.201 --> 24:14.912
So, MacLeish saved his life.

24:15.037 --> 24:18.207
If it weren't for MacLeish,
Lozano would've never made it home.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.752
We're worried about you, pal.

24:21.878 --> 24:23.421
Come on. Worried about what?
Everything's fine.

24:23.546 --> 24:26.883
Seth, come on.
You're working for an amateur.

24:27.383 --> 24:30.094
A nice guy, maybe, but someone
clearly incapable of doing the job.

24:30.219 --> 24:33.598
The nation's not seen this much
turmoil since the Civil War.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.766
You're the face
of a drowning administration.

24:35.892 --> 24:38.311
The handsome face
of a drowning administration,

24:38.436 --> 24:39.604
- I might add.
- Thank you.

24:39.729 --> 24:41.898
People think
they're not getting the whole story.

24:42.023 --> 24:44.317
They're wondering if there's a connection
between MacLeish and the shooter.

24:44.442 --> 24:46.486
Okay, let me just guess where
you're getting that information.

24:46.611 --> 24:47.945
<i>Teen Mode.</i>

24:48.070 --> 24:51.115
Seth, if there is any truth
to this Abe Leonard story at all...

24:51.240 --> 24:53.409
You really want to handcuff
yourself to a failed presidency?

24:53.534 --> 24:54.702
Guys, enough.

24:55.077 --> 24:58.122
I don't work at a hedge fund,
I don't work for a white-shoe law firm,

24:58.247 --> 25:00.249
I don't make superhero movies.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.461
I work for the President
of the United States.

25:04.295 --> 25:07.465
When your ship's taking on water,
you don't jump. You grab a bucket.

25:08.925 --> 25:10.593
I appreciate the concern.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.013
I love you guys. You know that.

25:14.138 --> 25:16.098
But I have to get back to the White House.

25:16.224 --> 25:17.558
All right? Thanks for flying down.

25:19.936 --> 25:23.481
The mission only explains
how Lozano met MacLeish.

25:24.106 --> 25:25.608
And why he owed him.

25:25.733 --> 25:26.943
Right.

25:29.111 --> 25:30.279
My opinion?

25:33.157 --> 25:36.327
This is exactly how MacLeish
was radicalized.

25:36.452 --> 25:39.622
The bond with his unit
went deeper than even family.

25:40.122 --> 25:42.166
To have his men sent in to slaughter,

25:42.291 --> 25:44.544
on a covert mission with a war criminal,

25:44.669 --> 25:47.338
and then to come back
and have their sacrifice...

25:47.463 --> 25:50.591
ignored and erased
by a callous government.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.970
The mission
that made MacLeish a hero...

25:54.428 --> 25:55.680
turned him into a traitor.

26:04.313 --> 26:06.857
I want a perimeter around
the school before we get there.

26:06.983 --> 26:08.818
We'll be traveling in alone.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.404
Phoenix will not be
exiting the vehicle.

26:11.529 --> 26:12.697
<i>Copy that.</i>

26:14.365 --> 26:15.825
Thank you, Mike.

26:46.564 --> 26:49.025
I've seen enough.
Let's go back to the White House.

26:56.699 --> 26:58.951
With all that's happened
in the past few weeks,

26:59.076 --> 27:01.287
the President is thrilled
to have a man of your experience

27:01.412 --> 27:04.373
stepping back into
the role of Secretary of State.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.417
Thank you, Ms. Rhodes,

27:06.542 --> 27:08.377
but let me stop you right there.

27:08.502 --> 27:10.421
After discussing it with my advisors,

27:10.546 --> 27:14.258
I'm gonna respectfully take
my name out of consideration.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.426
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

27:15.551 --> 27:18.095
Why come in if you had no intention
of taking the position?

27:18.220 --> 27:20.222
Out of respect for the President.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.600
I wanted to deliver the news in person.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.769
Well, that won't stop him
from being disappointed.

27:24.894 --> 27:26.103
I'm very sorry.

27:26.228 --> 27:28.189
But I did want to offer a suggestion.

27:28.689 --> 27:32.735
I've spoken to Cornelius Moss,
and he's willing to make recommendations

27:32.860 --> 27:34.445
on all of your cabinet posts.

27:34.570 --> 27:37.323
President Moss wants
to get back into politics?

27:37.448 --> 27:40.201
He just wants to share the benefit
of his experience. Nothing more.

27:40.618 --> 27:42.912
Would President Kirkman
be open to that?

27:46.624 --> 27:48.793
So, we'll try it for a month,
see how it goes.

27:48.918 --> 27:51.087
Thank you.

27:51.879 --> 27:53.881
What... what changed your mind?

27:55.883 --> 27:57.760
I went to Penny's school today.

27:57.885 --> 27:59.679
Mike arranged it
so that we could move out

27:59.804 --> 28:02.431
of the motorcade a block away
so she wouldn't know we were there.

28:04.100 --> 28:07.144
You know, one of my favorite things to do
before all this happened...

28:07.269 --> 28:08.896
Pick her up from school.

28:09.271 --> 28:11.899
I would get there early just
to watch her play with her friends.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.111
She doesn't have any anymore.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.446
Other kids aren't allowed near her.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.282
I'm robbing her of her childhood,

28:20.950 --> 28:22.827
and I don't know how to fix that yet,

28:22.952 --> 28:25.663
but anything's got to be
better than this.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.334
I agree.

28:30.668 --> 28:31.961
Thank you.

28:41.137 --> 28:42.805
So, where are we at?

28:42.930 --> 28:44.974
Just parsing through the haystack.

28:45.933 --> 28:48.477
Did any ID come back on the guy
you took out at Langdon's?

28:48.936 --> 28:51.021
No, I ran it through
every database we have:

28:51.147 --> 28:54.191
facial recognition,
dental records, fingerprints.

28:54.316 --> 28:55.443
No matches.

28:55.943 --> 28:58.154
Just like the woman who took Luke Atwood.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.573
I mean, to have every shred
of your existence

29:00.698 --> 29:02.283
scrubbed from the public record...

29:03.159 --> 29:04.493
these guys are good.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.829
We've got eyes out everywhere
for Langdon.

29:07.455 --> 29:09.039
But so far, nothing.

29:09.165 --> 29:11.167
He's out there... somewhere.

29:12.334 --> 29:16.046
You know, it's like Jason used to say,
we only have to be lucky once.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.174
They have to be lucky all the time.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.014
Hello?

29:26.682 --> 29:27.725
Jason?

29:29.685 --> 29:32.188
Jason, I came to check on you guys.

29:34.982 --> 29:36.192
I hope that's okay.

29:40.154 --> 29:41.614
Where's Yvette?

29:41.739 --> 29:44.074
She's at her sister's in Buffalo.

29:44.200 --> 29:47.536
She said everything about this place
reminds her of Luke.

29:48.537 --> 29:50.539
You know they canned me, right?

29:51.749 --> 29:53.876
They took my badge and my gun.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.377
I'm so sorry, Jason.

29:56.378 --> 29:58.756
I'm an embarrassment
to the entire Bureau.

29:59.215 --> 30:01.634
That is not true.
Don't even go there.

30:01.759 --> 30:04.261
20-plus years on the job,

30:04.386 --> 30:09.350
and all it took was for her
to show me that she had my son.

30:11.227 --> 30:14.396
And all of my training
just goes out the window.

30:17.233 --> 30:19.068
Let's make them pay, Jason.

30:20.236 --> 30:22.112
Tell me everything you know
about that woman.

30:22.238 --> 30:25.407
We'll find her, and we'll make her pay.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.703
Are you working me?

30:32.039 --> 30:34.291
- What are you talking about?
- You're working the case.

30:34.416 --> 30:35.918
- Jason, no.
- Come on. Don't. Don't.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.754
- No, I want justice for Luke.
- Justice?

30:41.423 --> 30:43.551
Justice is not gonna bring my son back.

30:47.054 --> 30:48.889
This is my justice.

30:50.266 --> 30:53.018
I went against everything that I am,

30:53.143 --> 30:55.062
and my son is dead because of it.

30:55.437 --> 30:58.315
You did everything you could.
You sacrificed everything.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.441
They did this.

31:01.819 --> 31:02.987
Please leave.

31:05.447 --> 31:07.449
Jason, I want to help.

31:08.450 --> 31:09.618
Get out.

31:32.641 --> 31:36.186
I've had several conversations
with Cornelius Moss since I took office.

31:36.312 --> 31:39.523
He never indicated any desire
to get back into politics.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.358
- Not even close.
- I know.

31:41.483 --> 31:44.194
After his wife died, he said
he was retiring from public life.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.196
That's why he never ran
for a second term.

31:46.322 --> 31:49.491
- Great public servant.
- And a consummate politician.

31:49.992 --> 31:51.368
I'm just saying, I wouldn't want him

31:51.493 --> 31:53.203
to pull focus from
what you're trying to achieve.

31:53.329 --> 31:54.663
No, I appreciate
what you're saying.

31:55.497 --> 31:57.666
But he's a president.
Inviting him into the White House

31:57.791 --> 32:00.169
could lift the nation,
project a sense of solidarity.

32:00.878 --> 32:03.047
- I'll set it up.
- Thank you.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.009
Mr. Wright.

32:07.134 --> 32:08.719
Mr. Leonard.

32:08.844 --> 32:11.013
Did you know "Wright"
comes from the Old English?

32:11.138 --> 32:13.891
- It means "shaper of wood."
- Huh.

32:14.016 --> 32:16.393
And here I was
thinking it meant "adulterer."

32:16.518 --> 32:18.395
Well, it intrigues me
you never knew the meaning

32:18.520 --> 32:20.981
of your last name,
considering you picked it.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.528
Is there something
I can help you with, Mr. Leonard?

32:26.904 --> 32:29.740
Yeah, I'm curious
how the <i>Tribune</i> and the <i>Post</i>

32:29.865 --> 32:32.618
both did stories
on my <i>return</i> to journalism

32:32.743 --> 32:34.870
on the exact same day.

32:34.995 --> 32:37.581
You're a Pulitzer winner making
a comeback with <i>Teen Mode.</i>

32:37.706 --> 32:39.041
Don't you think that's newsworthy?

32:39.166 --> 32:41.585
And the fact that I lost
my credentials from the <i>Herald</i>

32:41.710 --> 32:45.923
due to rogue tactics that border more
on extortion than journalism.

32:46.548 --> 32:47.800
It's public record.

32:47.925 --> 32:50.636
You know that I can't, uh...
control what the press pushes out.

32:50.761 --> 32:52.054
No. Of course you can't.

32:52.179 --> 32:54.098
You just read announcements
handed to you by the President.

32:55.724 --> 32:58.310
Well, I must say,
I am actually flattered, so...

32:58.435 --> 33:00.354
To feel somewhat relevant again?

33:04.024 --> 33:05.943
When I was on the debate team
at Northwestern,

33:06.068 --> 33:09.446
I learned that discrediting a source
is the oldest trick in the book.

33:09.571 --> 33:12.116
It's bush league, but it's effective

33:12.241 --> 33:14.952
if done properly
under two circumstances.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.996
One: it's a last resort,

33:17.121 --> 33:20.582
and two: when you're confronted
with a truth you can't refute.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.628
Now, I would say "goodbye"
in Old English,

33:24.753 --> 33:26.964
but I-I honestly can't pronounce it.

33:27.423 --> 33:29.591
But apparently, it wouldn't matter.
So...

33:30.426 --> 33:32.594
<i>Adieu,</i> Mr. Wright.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.814
Sir, you really think
this is a good idea?

33:43.939 --> 33:45.816
I think the people have
every right to know

33:45.941 --> 33:48.110
what MacLeish did with regards
to the shooter.

33:48.235 --> 33:51.113
Besides... I'm not comfortable
sitting on the truth anymore.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.948
- Okay, I'll inform the networks.
- Thank you.

33:53.073 --> 33:55.159
Do you mind if I take a pass
at your remarks?

33:55.284 --> 33:56.785
I was hoping you would.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.247
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Seth.

34:04.793 --> 34:07.129
I didn't ask for another one.

34:07.254 --> 34:09.380
Well, it's from the gentleman
with the insatiable appetite

34:09.505 --> 34:12.801
for loose women and anything alcoholic.

34:13.802 --> 34:14.969
Hello, Abe.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.804
What do you say, Kimble?

34:17.639 --> 34:19.475
Still drinking that turpentine.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.643
Yeah, read all about it.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.645
I have been.

34:23.771 --> 34:26.231
Rookie move by a dittohead neophyte.

34:26.356 --> 34:27.274
Hey!

34:29.818 --> 34:31.820
I wouldn't underestimate Seth Wright.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.822
We're dealing with children, Kimble.

34:35.866 --> 34:38.202
Coddled millennials
who wouldn't know a real story

34:38.327 --> 34:40.161
if it bit them in the ass.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.206
Same old Abe.

34:43.498 --> 34:44.708
Well, you must have hit a nerve,

34:44.833 --> 34:46.918
or the White House wouldn't be
going to all this trouble

34:47.043 --> 34:49.213
to remind people
what a train wreck you are.

34:49.338 --> 34:52.382
I've gotten mocked and ridiculed
by better hatchet men than them.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.426
If they think a smear campaign
is gonna stop me...

34:54.551 --> 34:57.554
...they got another thing coming.

34:57.679 --> 35:01.558
Still, Kirkman's smart,
and he's learning on the job.

35:01.683 --> 35:03.936
I've seen bare-knuckle campaigners

35:04.061 --> 35:06.271
barely make it through
a single term as president.

35:06.396 --> 35:08.524
You can't learn on the job.
Come on.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.278
It's taken everything
in my empty soul

35:13.403 --> 35:15.364
to get back in this game,
and there's zero chance

35:15.489 --> 35:18.826
I'm gonna let some amateurs in diapers
push me out again.

35:19.868 --> 35:22.538
There's a connection between
MacLeish and the shooter,

35:22.871 --> 35:24.414
and I'm gonna find it.

35:30.212 --> 35:32.381
If anything happens,
if Penny gets a splinter,

35:32.506 --> 35:35.217
- I want to know as soon as possible.
- I know. I know.

35:35.342 --> 35:37.302
Listen, we're only an hour away, okay?

35:37.427 --> 35:40.055
- I'm gonna get back as often as I can.
- Okay.

35:41.515 --> 35:43.767
Leo, you all right with this?

35:44.351 --> 35:46.103
I'll be fine. It's a good call.

35:46.228 --> 35:47.729
Come here.

35:48.272 --> 35:50.566
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.360
And you!

35:53.944 --> 35:57.573
I need you to look after
your mom and your brother.

35:57.906 --> 35:58.949
What's this?

35:59.616 --> 36:01.451
The drawing I was working on.

36:04.705 --> 36:07.082
Sweetheart, I was supposed
to help you finish it.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.501
I'm so sorry.

36:09.626 --> 36:10.627
It's okay.

36:11.253 --> 36:12.296
Come here.

36:13.088 --> 36:14.798
I love you so much.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.758
I love you, too.

36:18.635 --> 36:20.470
Okay. Time to get in.

36:23.765 --> 36:25.601
Call me as soon as you get there.

36:26.268 --> 36:27.644
Please.

36:31.398 --> 36:33.400
I love you with all my heart.

36:34.610 --> 36:37.654
- Could you take care of yourself, please?
- I promise I will.

36:39.740 --> 36:40.741
Bye, guys.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.493
Bye, Daddy.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.336
<i>My fellow Americans...</i>

37:34.461 --> 37:37.547
<i>Due to recent events,
we live in a time of uncertainty,</i>

37:37.673 --> 37:40.509
leaving us with
more questions than answers.

37:40.634 --> 37:44.054
Tonight, I hope to put us back
on the path to confidence and strength.

37:44.179 --> 37:48.475
I do not believe that we can survive
as a nation without transparency.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.436
Without truth, there can be no trust.

37:51.561 --> 37:55.232
As your President, I assure you
that I and my administration

37:55.357 --> 37:57.401
will be honest and open on all matters,

37:57.526 --> 38:00.612
<i>regardless of how the truth
reflects upon me.</i>

38:00.737 --> 38:03.240
<i>This afternoon, a question
was raised by Abe Leonard,</i>

38:03.365 --> 38:05.909
<i>a respected member of our press pool,</i>

38:06.034 --> 38:09.121
<i>which I believe the American people
deserve an answer to.</i>

38:09.246 --> 38:12.582
<i>During the search for the man
who tried to assassinate me,</i>

38:12.708 --> 38:16.295
<i>Vice President MacLeish
unilaterally issued a shoot-to-kill order</i>

38:16.420 --> 38:20.424
over the strong objections of the FBI
and my Chief of Staff, Aaron Shore.

38:20.924 --> 38:22.217
Because I was in surgery,

38:22.342 --> 38:24.428
I was forced to invoke
the 25th Amendment,

38:24.553 --> 38:28.140
giving the Vice President
the authority to make such a call.

38:28.265 --> 38:30.392
It's not a call
I believe I would have made.

38:30.726 --> 38:34.229
Nonetheless, I respected
Peter MacLeish's experience as a soldier.

38:34.730 --> 38:37.774
He made a split-second decision
that he felt protected

38:37.899 --> 38:40.110
not only the federal agents
at the scene,

38:40.235 --> 38:41.903
but the general public, as well.

38:42.738 --> 38:45.115
<i>I know this answer
will not satisfy everyone.</i>

38:45.240 --> 38:48.744
<i>But this is what happened,
and it's how it happened.</i>

38:49.244 --> 38:50.912
<i>In times of crisis,</i>

38:51.038 --> 38:53.457
<i>we must not succumb
to cynicism and mistrust.</i>

38:53.582 --> 38:57.502
<i>Instead, we must maintain faith
while embracing reason and truth,</i>

38:57.627 --> 38:59.463
<i>not speculation and rumor.</i>

38:59.588 --> 39:03.091
<i>Again, we can only attain this
through transparency.</i>

39:03.592 --> 39:07.971
Believe me, I know what the American
people have been feeling.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.973
I know that there is
confusion and fear.

39:10.432 --> 39:14.144
I know that some do not even
feel safe leaving their homes.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.438
President Lincoln prophetically cautioned,

39:16.563 --> 39:19.483
"A house divided against itself
cannot stand."

39:20.275 --> 39:22.444
We are at a similar crossroads.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.780
But Lincoln did not expect
his house to fall,

39:24.905 --> 39:26.782
and neither do I.

39:27.115 --> 39:30.160
The American people must now
make the most important decision

39:30.285 --> 39:32.204
they've had to make in generations.

39:32.329 --> 39:35.665
Will we be united in the pursuit
of truth and reason?

39:35.791 --> 39:38.794
Or break apart because
of conjecture and suspicion?

39:39.336 --> 39:44.007
I trust this nation - my nation -
to make the right choice.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.675
Thank you, good night,

39:45.801 --> 39:47.803
and God bless America.

39:48.345 --> 39:50.680
And we're clear, Mr. President.

39:51.473 --> 39:52.516
Thank you.

40:40.856 --> 40:42.232
Aaron.

40:44.484 --> 40:45.694
Langdon?

40:45.819 --> 40:47.195
Not here.

40:56.413 --> 40:58.665
Aaron Shore's made contact with someone.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.877
That's
Charles Langdon.
