WEBVTT

00:11.845 --> 00:14.264
Wow. Sounds like a rough night.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.683
I mean, we've had bad fights.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.309
It's been a while.

00:18.309 --> 00:20.061
Definitely before June was born.

00:20.729 --> 00:23.148
But I don't know, I just...

00:23.940 --> 00:26.025
I don't understand why she was so angry.

00:26.025 --> 00:29.612
No, and like I said,
that was totally out of line.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.781
Honestly?

00:32.741 --> 00:35.326
I can't even enjoy anything vanilla
since her comment.

00:35.326 --> 00:36.286
I'm sorry.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.664
I've just been really stressed
about the deal.

00:40.248 --> 00:41.958
But it won't happen again.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.336
I've found ways to manage my stress.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.839
What have you found works for you?

00:50.633 --> 00:52.802
<i>Well, you know, I just close my eyes</i>

00:52.802 --> 00:55.972
<i>and clear my head,
and focus on my breathing.</i>

00:55.972 --> 00:57.515
Stupid yuppy-ass house.

00:57.515 --> 01:00.018
<i>My mind wanders
to some silly places sometimes</i>

01:00.018 --> 01:02.187
<i>- but it's okay.</i>
- Fuck!

01:02.187 --> 01:04.230
<i>The human brain, wow, right?</i>

01:08.526 --> 01:09.652
That's great, Amy.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.198
I've been telling her
to meditate for years.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.408
I've sent her so many links.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.619
And thank you for the links, George.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.955
George, have you noticed a change?

01:20.955 --> 01:24.667
I mean, we've been doing better
since the fight.

01:25.668 --> 01:30.548
But all those things she said
can't be coming out of nowhere, right?

01:30.548 --> 01:33.718
I mean, got to dig a little deeper.

01:34.302 --> 01:35.136
Right?

01:36.221 --> 01:39.140
Now, Amy, when he says that

01:39.140 --> 01:43.269
and you hear him saying that,
what does that make you want to say?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.314
Cards on the table?

01:48.191 --> 01:49.567
I wanna say he's right.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.447
<i>You know, my dad held a lot in.</i>

01:55.198 --> 01:59.536
<i>Chinese guy from the Midwest,
I mean, communication wasn't his forte.</i>

02:01.496 --> 02:06.501
<i>He'd just bottle up everything inside
until it just exploded out at once.</i>

02:06.501 --> 02:07.669
Fuck!

02:07.669 --> 02:10.338
Fucking God!

02:10.839 --> 02:13.591
<i>My mom, she wasn't any better.</i>

02:14.843 --> 02:15.677
Fuck!

02:15.677 --> 02:17.804
<i>She thought that talking
about your feelings</i>

02:17.804 --> 02:19.597
<i>was the same thing as complaining.</i>

02:19.597 --> 02:22.016
<i>She told me the first time
she heard birds singing</i>

02:22.016 --> 02:23.893
<i>was when she came to America,</i>

02:23.893 --> 02:28.148
<i>because during the Vietnam War,
they ate all the birds.</i>

02:28.148 --> 02:32.402
<i>Can you imagine
what that does to a person? No birds.</i>

02:34.529 --> 02:35.864
It's hard to admit, but...

02:36.614 --> 02:40.827
I think growing up with my parents
taught me to repress all my feelings.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.789
- Breakthrough moment, babe.
- No.

02:45.790 --> 02:48.293
Amy, that's very...

02:49.502 --> 02:50.920
self-aware.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.130
Thank you.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.382
You know, when we're stressed,

02:54.382 --> 02:57.594
we revert to the pathways
we created as children.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.888
No. Yeah, I mean,
it all comes down to parents

02:59.888 --> 03:02.807
and I'm excited to dig into that.

03:02.807 --> 03:06.352
But acknowledging this
is just the first step.

03:07.186 --> 03:09.772
In order to create new neural pathways,

03:09.772 --> 03:14.110
we have to uncover
what lies underneath our awareness.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.654
Right.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.365
<i>I think maybe subconsciously</i>

03:19.365 --> 03:23.369
<i>that's why I leave most of
Junie's caretaking in George's hands.</i>

03:23.369 --> 03:27.165
<i>Maybe part of me is afraid
that I'll create in Junie the same, uh...</i>

03:27.165 --> 03:28.791
<i>What was it you called it?</i>

03:28.791 --> 03:31.794
<i>...neural pathways
that my parents did in me.</i>

03:32.795 --> 03:34.672
<i>But I don't wanna live like that anymore.</i>

03:36.841 --> 03:39.010
<i>- I don't wanna live in fear.</i>

03:40.511 --> 03:42.263
- Oh, fuck.
<i>I've been holding a lot in,</i>

03:42.263 --> 03:44.057
<i>- but I'm not anymore.</i>
- Shit.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.351
<i>I know it's gonna take a lot of work,</i>

03:46.351 --> 03:49.520
<i>but I really think this is the start
of a new chapter for our family.</i>

03:49.520 --> 03:50.647
What am I doing?

03:52.607 --> 03:54.692
- I'm really glad we did this.
- Yeah.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.237
Me too.

04:09.874 --> 04:10.708
Paul.

04:11.668 --> 04:12.502
Hey.

04:13.628 --> 04:14.462
Yo.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.132
Yo, Paul, I need to talk to you, dude.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.133
Turn that down.

04:20.468 --> 04:21.886
Paul, turn that down.

04:23.054 --> 04:26.015
Paul, turn that shit off, dude.
I almost lit a baby on fire!

04:27.725 --> 04:29.727
Sounds like you and Isaac are killing it.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.563
Yo, why is this place so clean?

04:33.815 --> 04:36.693
Where you going?
What's with all the new clothes and shit?

04:37.485 --> 04:39.696
Me and Kayla been talking.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.156
If you see something you like,
you go get it.

04:42.156 --> 04:43.074
Right, bro?

04:44.951 --> 04:46.411
She wasn't a bot.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.709
The fuck is happening right now?

04:52.709 --> 04:53.626
Fuck!

05:02.885 --> 05:04.387
Look at this stupid shit.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.596
So happy.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.942
Mom, smile bigger.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.737
Oh. Gosh, she's so strict.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.072
You should've seen her
at the baby cow farm.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.410
Mom, stop moving.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.625
Mom.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.962
Is everything okay?
Everything's fine.

05:37.962 --> 05:41.841
Yeah, let's have a group hug
and take a family selfie.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.302
Good call, babe.
Lighting's great right now.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.470
I know.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.472
Ready? Okay, say "cheese!"

05:47.472 --> 05:49.474
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

05:54.729 --> 05:55.938
Can I see?

05:55.938 --> 05:56.856
Yeah.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.153
- Babe, are my cheeks getting bigger?
- No, honey. They're the same.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.614
- Can I see it again?
- Look at this.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.240
Junie, oh, my gosh!

06:06.240 --> 06:07.784
I love what you painted, honey.

06:07.784 --> 06:08.951
This is so good.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.329
Junie, this is beautiful.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.997
It's not done yet.

06:12.997 --> 06:14.916
Mommy has to head to a meeting

06:14.916 --> 06:17.251
but when I come home
we'll finish this then.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.296
And, you know, pretty soon

06:20.296 --> 06:23.299
I'll get to spend every day with you
all the time.

06:23.299 --> 06:24.258
- Okay?
- Okay.

06:24.258 --> 06:25.760
Yeah?

06:27.345 --> 06:28.262
I'll be back soon.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.306
Hey. Good luck with Jordan today.

06:30.306 --> 06:31.974
I hope she's over the chair.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.644
Tell her we can sell her
some other pieces if that helps.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.229
Thanks, babe. That means a lot.

06:36.229 --> 06:40.024
I talked to Naomi and she thinks
I just have to go over there

06:40.024 --> 06:42.360
- and kiss the ring a little bit.
- Ah.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.071
Yeah. Do not forget
to set the alarm, okay?

06:45.071 --> 06:48.366
Amy, we don't have to live in fear
of that handyman.

06:48.366 --> 06:51.077
If I see him around,
I'm gonna rough him up.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.079
- Okay.
You think I'm joking.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.715
God, we thank you for this Sunday.

07:05.675 --> 07:09.804
We thank you for inviting us here today
to gather in your presence.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.141
We thank you for who you are
and what you've done.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.144
Thank you for the cross.
We thank you for Jesus.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.688
Lord Father God, we come to you...

07:18.688 --> 07:20.440
Hi. Pastor Kim.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.984
Great to have you. Welcome.

07:23.818 --> 07:27.029
...that you can take us
in our brokenness and our need,

07:27.029 --> 07:29.365
and that you meet us here today, Lord.

07:29.365 --> 07:32.368
We ask for your spirit
to come and fill this place

07:32.368 --> 07:36.205
that we might worship you joyfully
with all of our hearts.

Jesus, heavenly God,
please be with my brother,

09:39.245 --> 09:40.955
our new family member.

09:41.497 --> 09:45.084
We ask you to shower him
with your unconditional love.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.252
Thank you.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.051
You gotta understand.

09:54.051 --> 09:57.096
George is just very attached
to the Tamago.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.390
- He had it all through his childhood--
Yeah.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.684
"Tomah-go." "Tomay-go."

10:03.060 --> 10:04.729
Let's talk about your business, Amy.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.480
- Yeah, the business.
- Mm-hm.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.691
You know, it's so crazy,
I read this article

10:08.691 --> 10:11.569
about how millennials
can't afford to have kids,

10:11.569 --> 10:14.989
so they're satisfying
their need to nurture with plants--

10:14.989 --> 10:16.824
Have you ever been to China?

10:17.742 --> 10:18.701
Uh...

10:19.327 --> 10:21.621
Yeah. Once when I was 6.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.039
Only once.

10:23.539 --> 10:24.582
Next time you're there,

10:24.582 --> 10:27.043
you have to check out
the beaches of Sanya.

10:27.043 --> 10:30.338
- Oh. Sanyaaas.
- Yeah!

10:30.338 --> 10:32.590
- Yes.

10:32.590 --> 10:36.135
See, that's what I'm talking about.
That's how they do business over there.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.512
Spending time together, laughing.

10:38.512 --> 10:41.599
Here in the West,
it's deal points, numbers.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.683
Oh, yeah, yeah.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.353
I definitely prefer
how they do business...

10:45.853 --> 10:47.730
- over there. Yup.
- Mm.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.315
Five-minute reminder.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.816
Pardon me.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.402
I have to go check out some panic rooms.

10:53.402 --> 10:56.697
Smart. I mean,
there's a lot to panic about these days.

10:56.697 --> 10:59.950
Right? Did Naomi show you
that road rage video?

10:59.950 --> 11:01.661
The world's gone completely insane.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.288
She did. It's really terrible.

11:05.748 --> 11:09.460
Why don't you stick around for a while?
We'll continue this when I get back, yeah?

11:09.460 --> 11:11.379
Let me check my schedule first.

11:11.379 --> 11:16.133
You know, Amy, the thing is,
even if the deal looks great on paper,

11:16.133 --> 11:19.720
we still need to
get to know each other as humans.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.306
Make sure we both
feel good about this, right?

11:23.140 --> 11:24.016
Right.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.768
Good.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.270
I'll be back soon. Make yourself at home.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.176
Hey.

11:59.176 --> 12:02.012
- I'm so glad you made it out.
- Good to see you again, Daniel.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.806
Man, you were great up there.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.725
That F sharp you hit was crazy.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.644
- Oh. Thank you.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.022
How are you feeling? You doing okay?

12:12.022 --> 12:13.691
Yeah, I think I just...

12:14.316 --> 12:16.485
Think I just needed
a good cry or something.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.821
I'm sorry, I didn't know
what that was about.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.281
You don't have to apologize.

12:20.281 --> 12:23.659
Yeah, I actually break down
all the time up there.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.869
You can let it out.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.495
I appreciate that.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.497
Will we be seeing you regularly?

12:29.206 --> 12:32.543
Um, I live kind of far so--

12:32.543 --> 12:34.962
I think I just needed it this one time.

12:34.962 --> 12:38.591
Well, Edwin always says,
"A church alive is worth the drive."

12:39.550 --> 12:40.551
Right.

12:40.551 --> 12:41.927
I do say that.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.306
At least fill out a welcome form.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.476
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, good. Uh--

12:49.143 --> 12:50.269
Form.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.562
Right, okay.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.397
I can do a form.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.191
All right.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.277
You need to get a pen too.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.654
You guys got Friday night basketball?

13:00.654 --> 13:02.531
We do.
- Thank you.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.450
It gets pretty competitive, though.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.994
- Be forewarned.
- Okay.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.954
You guys got D1 players playing with you?

13:08.954 --> 13:12.625
No, no, but we're good, so...

13:13.584 --> 13:14.460
Mm.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.422
She's using the deal as leverage.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.049
I don't wanna hang out.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.842
Just give me the money, lady!

13:21.842 --> 13:24.011
<i>Look, we can do date night anytime</i>

13:24.011 --> 13:26.222
<i>and we can do our intimacy exercise later.</i>

13:26.222 --> 13:27.932
<i>Remember what Dr. Lin said.</i>

13:27.932 --> 13:30.643
<i>We owe it to ourselves to stay positive.</i>

13:30.643 --> 13:31.644
<i>Say it with me.</i>

13:31.644 --> 13:35.523
- We owe it to ourselves to stay positive.
<i>- We owe it to ourselves to stay positive.</i>

13:36.857 --> 13:37.775
<i>Amy?</i>

13:37.775 --> 13:39.235
<i>Hello, you still there?</i>

13:39.235 --> 13:41.237
This bitch is wild.

13:41.237 --> 13:45.115
George, she has this room
full of, like, actual crowns.

13:45.115 --> 13:46.534
She's fucking crazy.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.410
<i>Babe, don't be mean.</i>

13:48.410 --> 13:50.579
<i>I'm actually jealous. What a home.</i>

13:50.579 --> 13:52.289
<i>Treat it like a staycation.</i>

13:52.289 --> 13:54.667
Yeah. No, you're right.
I shouldn't complain.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.544
<i>See? There you go.</i>

13:56.544 --> 13:58.045
<i>Take it all in.</i>

13:58.045 --> 13:59.505
<i>I took a photo at the dinner.</i>

13:59.505 --> 14:01.840
<i>It was the cutest plant I've ever met.</i>

14:01.840 --> 14:03.175
<i>Hold on. Let me send.</i>

14:03.175 --> 14:04.093
Yeah?

14:07.096 --> 14:08.305
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

14:11.517 --> 14:13.435
<i>Amy, I can explain.</i>

14:13.435 --> 14:16.188
<i>- I was just saving the captions--</i>

14:28.576 --> 14:29.952
Wow.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.579
Thank you, Daniel.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.747
We've been meaning
to get someone to fix this.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.791
It's nothing. It was the least I could do.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.085
So, what brought you
down to Orange County?

14:38.085 --> 14:41.630
Are things slow this time of year?

14:41.630 --> 14:43.591
- Slow?
- Yeah.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.843
Uh, no, things are fast.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.095
It's fast times. Boom market.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.056
We could have you do
some repairs around here.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.725
We'd pay, of course.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.769
We'd love to support
a Korean-owned small business.

14:55.769 --> 14:59.815
Don't even worry about it.
You know, I love to support nonprofits.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.026
I do a lot of charity work.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.485
Thank you, brother.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.238
So glad you joined our congregation.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.364
Me too.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.619
Is it still...

15:13.203 --> 15:14.288
a little crooked?

16:41.333 --> 16:42.209
<i>Hello?</i>

16:43.043 --> 16:44.837
Um, hi.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.964
<i>Hi.</i>

16:49.299 --> 16:50.175
Hello.

16:52.177 --> 16:56.890
<i>So who made your day so shitty
and where do I have to go to beat them up?</i>

16:58.350 --> 17:01.520
Um, it's just my boss.

17:02.229 --> 17:06.483
I hate having to put her feelings
before mine all the time.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.485
<i>Old people are stupid like that,</i>

17:09.153 --> 17:12.197
<i>taking it out on us
because they regret their life decisions.</i>

17:13.198 --> 17:14.033
Totally.

17:14.616 --> 17:15.951
<i>What else do you hate?</i>

17:17.578 --> 17:20.748
Uh, gosh, you know, it's a--

17:20.748 --> 17:23.042
No one's ever asked me that before.

17:23.959 --> 17:24.918
Um...

17:26.086 --> 17:27.463
Well, to be honest, uh...

17:29.548 --> 17:32.634
I hate pretending
that I don't hate things.

17:32.634 --> 17:33.969
<i>Like what?</i>

17:35.345 --> 17:36.305
Mm.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.057
Like work.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.852
I-- I hate work.

17:42.686 --> 17:46.356
I wish I could just,
like, do nothing all day.

17:48.275 --> 17:49.777
Not have to worry about money.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.906
<i>Yo, you're way too hot
to be worrying about money.</i>

17:56.075 --> 17:58.702
Yeah, you know, I do some modeling,

17:59.870 --> 18:01.288
but it's not my passion.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.415
<i>You even sound hot.</i>

18:05.667 --> 18:08.587
All right. What about you, Paul?
What do you hate?

18:10.798 --> 18:12.508
<i>If I'm being real with you...</i>

18:13.801 --> 18:15.803
<i>kind of hate my brother right now.</i>

18:18.013 --> 18:21.266
- Right, your brother.
<i>- I don't really wanna talk about it.</i>

18:22.101 --> 18:24.436
Well, you know, for what it's worth,

18:24.937 --> 18:26.730
you sound way cooler than him.

18:27.856 --> 18:31.151
<i>You know, this might sound sort of, um--</i>

18:31.652 --> 18:33.529
<i>Actually, I don't care how it sounds.</i>

18:34.071 --> 18:37.241
<i>I know we've been only
DMing for a couple days,</i>

18:38.325 --> 18:40.577
<i>but I feel like I've been
DMing you my whole life.</i>

18:41.078 --> 18:42.246
<i>I really like you.</i>

18:44.957 --> 18:45.874
<i>Kayla?</i>

18:47.709 --> 18:51.213
<i>- You there? Kayla?</i>
- What the fuck am I doing?

18:57.886 --> 18:58.929
Oh, my God.

18:59.721 --> 19:02.516
- You scared me.
- My apologies.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.352
Jordan got called into a work emergency
and has to reschedule,

19:05.352 --> 19:07.437
but feel free to stay
as long as you please.

19:17.072 --> 19:19.491
He says, like,
things must be slow this time of year.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.786
Like, what? Like, don't come at me
because I'm your girl's first.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.913
What you gonna do about it?

19:25.706 --> 19:27.374
I don't know. What can I do?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.794
He leads Praise Team. He's untouchable.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.921
"He leads Praise Team. He's untouchable."

19:32.921 --> 19:34.965
Dude, touch him
wherever the fuck you want.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.634
So you ain't gonna do shit,
like with the road rage bitch?

19:37.634 --> 19:39.595
She's got private security money, okay?

19:39.595 --> 19:40.762
- Like--
- Fuck that.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.723
You know what? I don't care.

19:42.723 --> 19:45.726
'Cause today, man...
I really felt something today.

19:45.726 --> 19:46.643
Oh, yeah?

19:47.603 --> 19:50.814
It's like I actually felt God's presence.

19:50.814 --> 19:54.526
Well, Jesus did all those nice things,
look what they did to him.

19:54.526 --> 19:58.155
Dude, you gotta relax, man.
Just let this chair do its thing.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.157
This is how they make Kobe beef.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.784
- Yeah, shake that shit.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.079
- I know what will cheer you up.
- What?

20:06.079 --> 20:07.497
Dude, check this out.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.249
Look at that.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.544
- You made shirts?
- Fuck, yeah, I made shirts.

20:12.544 --> 20:13.962
Chosen Ones, bitch.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.465
I got one for you too. Try it on.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.800
What size is this?

20:18.800 --> 20:20.427
It's Size P for "perfect."

20:20.427 --> 20:21.929
Put that shit on, dude.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.057
And I filed those incorporation papers
under my name.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.558
Took that shit off your plate.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.145
Ugh. What's the point of all this, anyway?

20:31.271 --> 20:34.983
Man, I always do the right thing,
and look where it's gotten me.

20:36.652 --> 20:40.280
You know there's contractors out there
that are scammers?

20:40.280 --> 20:41.573
- Mm-hmm.
- And I'm sitting here,

20:41.573 --> 20:43.116
fixing church stuff for free.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.327
See, that's your problem, man.
You're too nice.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.913
I live by four words only.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.831
"Pro bono? No bono."

20:51.708 --> 20:54.002
- Yo, Isaac.
- Yo, what up, Kane?

20:54.002 --> 20:56.630
- Thanks for the OB, man.
- No worries, bro.

20:56.630 --> 21:00.008
- Sick chairs, right?
- Dude, I fucking love this shit.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.385
Uncle hooked it up.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.720
Tell him I say what's up.
For sure.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.222
- I got them wholesale.
- What?

21:05.222 --> 21:07.307
- Got seven more in the back.
- Oh.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.811
You know what?
I'm going to take two, all right?

21:10.811 --> 21:13.063
All right.
- One for me and sexy boy over there.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.857
- Two tans. I wanna match. Yeah.
- Two matching? You got it.

21:17.526 --> 21:18.986
Yo, seriously, man?

21:19.528 --> 21:21.405
Chosen Ones, motherfucker.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.711
How much longer do we have?

21:36.336 --> 21:39.006
Oh, 22 minutes.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.925
Dr. Lin wants us to do the full 30.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.641
Junie kept working
on her painting all night.

21:51.893 --> 21:55.188
Well, she gets
all her talent from you, so...

21:59.151 --> 22:00.360
What's wrong, Amy?

22:01.153 --> 22:02.154
Hey.

22:02.946 --> 22:05.365
Hey, it's okay. You can talk to me.

22:07.617 --> 22:09.286
Is this about the Mia photo?

22:09.786 --> 22:12.497
Babe, I swear there was nothing to it.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.498
No, George. Um--

22:16.543 --> 22:17.711
There's this, um...

22:19.629 --> 22:20.547
feeling...

22:21.631 --> 22:23.675
I've had for a long time.

22:23.675 --> 22:24.593
Um...

22:25.135 --> 22:28.638
I don't remember... when it started.

22:28.638 --> 22:32.017
I can't pinpoint exactly when or why...

22:37.522 --> 22:39.858
but it feels like the ground...

22:42.694 --> 22:43.570
But like, um--

22:46.823 --> 22:48.492
Like-- But like right here.

22:52.746 --> 22:53.997
- Um...

22:56.416 --> 22:57.793
It never goes away.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.424
When I was in college,
I tried to get help, I did.

23:04.424 --> 23:07.427
I saw the psychiatrist,
and he put me on antidepressants,

23:07.427 --> 23:08.762
but all it did was mute it.

23:08.762 --> 23:13.600
Like, it took the sound off, but it
kept on playing, you know, and, uh...

23:14.101 --> 23:16.603
- I'm sorry, I'm just babbling.
- No, no, no.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.356
I want you to talk to me about this.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.650
Yeah, and, George, I do.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.819
You know, I want to, but, uh...

23:26.780 --> 23:31.034
Look, I love that
we're so... complementary.

23:33.995 --> 23:37.415
But sometimes, it feels like
if I tell you things, you're just...

23:39.334 --> 23:40.836
You're not gonna understand.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.506
Of course, I do.

23:45.006 --> 23:48.802
I know a lot of people
who battled depression and won.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.095
No, it's not--

23:52.347 --> 23:55.475
- Never mind.
- No, really, I understand.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.602
And I get down too.

23:58.311 --> 24:03.567
Like, I never pictured myself
being a stay-at-home dad, you know.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.820
I never thought my art
would be secondary to anything.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.532
But I embrace the sadness.

24:12.284 --> 24:15.036
I mean, since we're both being vulnerable,

24:15.036 --> 24:19.082
I admit, sometimes I think about
what my life would have been like

24:19.082 --> 24:21.251
had you and I never met.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.842
Wow. I never knew you felt that way.

24:28.842 --> 24:31.678
Yeah. I guess I'm just sharing,

24:32.971 --> 24:35.640
because I want you to know
you're not alone.

24:37.100 --> 24:40.520
You can share anything.

24:43.356 --> 24:44.733
Yeah, I know.

24:45.692 --> 24:48.320
Thank you. Thank you for sharing, George.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.529
You're welcome.

25:04.377 --> 25:06.630
Yeah. No, I know it's a lot of money,

25:06.630 --> 25:09.758
but I plan on doing
the renovations myself to the property,

25:09.758 --> 25:11.468
so it's a sound investment.

25:12.260 --> 25:15.388
It's not for me. It's for my parents.
I'm moving them back from Korea.

25:15.388 --> 25:18.183
<i>Well, keep in mind, Mr. Cho,
you don't have the best credit.</i>

25:18.683 --> 25:19.809
Right, yeah.

25:19.809 --> 25:22.938
Um, when I was 18,
I went to BR for cargo pants,

25:22.938 --> 25:25.565
and next thing I knew,
I was signed up for a credit card.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.192
<i>- BR?</i>
- Banana Repub--

25:28.109 --> 25:30.946
How long would it take for me
to be approved for a mortgage?

25:30.946 --> 25:32.822
Don't I need, like, 20%?

25:33.490 --> 25:35.116
<i>The down payment would be 100,000,</i>

25:35.116 --> 25:37.619
<i>but you'd also need to demonstrate
a consistent income</i>

25:37.619 --> 25:39.246
<i>and a healthy checking balance.</i>

25:39.246 --> 25:42.040
<i>Now, on the track you're on,
we could maybe consider you in,</i>

25:42.040 --> 25:43.667
<i>I don't know, seven years.</i>

25:46.211 --> 25:48.296
Look, I don't think you understand.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.340
My parents are getting old, okay?

25:50.340 --> 25:53.718
And this land is not gonna be
available much longer.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.888
I don't understand why everyone else
gets approved for a loan but me.

25:57.555 --> 26:02.394
<i>Mr. Cho, I think you'll find this answer
consistent at whatever bank you may visit.</i>

26:02.394 --> 26:04.479
<i>Look, if you can come up
with a down payment,</i>

26:04.479 --> 26:06.856
<i>then maybe this is
a conversation that we can have.</i>

26:06.856 --> 26:09.359
Okay. No, I understand. Um...

26:10.360 --> 26:13.196
Thank you. Yeah, thank you for your time.

26:13.196 --> 26:14.281
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

26:14.781 --> 26:17.534
Actually, while I have you,

26:18.159 --> 26:22.580
my church was looking to do some repairs.

26:23.206 --> 26:26.459
- Would they be able to get a loan?
<i>- We can look into it.</i>

26:26.459 --> 26:27.460
Uh-huh.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.965
I think it's your best one yet.

26:31.965 --> 26:35.260
- Should we put this up on the wall?
- It's not done yet.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.970
No, it's perfect, Junie.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.389
- Come on, let's put it up.
- Okay.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.477
- Babe?
- Yep?

26:44.477 --> 26:46.479
I think Jordan's here.

26:50.859 --> 26:55.864
Amy, I figured it would be best
to discuss the term sheet in person.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.866
Hey, I'm sorry about last night.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.702
- Did you miss me?
- Yeah, I really did.

27:00.702 --> 27:05.582
Hey, Jordan, am I reading this right?
You want me to stay on?

27:05.582 --> 27:09.210
A hold back period of five years
and withholding equity?

27:10.086 --> 27:12.255
I brought some honey on the side.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.214
Perfect.

27:13.798 --> 27:14.799
Thank you, Joji.

27:17.093 --> 27:19.095
- Thanks, George.
- Mm-hm.

27:20.597 --> 27:23.141
Jordan, this isn't
what we discussed. Okay?

27:23.141 --> 27:26.728
- I had no intention of staying on.
- I know, I know, I know.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.564
But, honey, you are the face of the brand.

27:29.564 --> 27:32.442
The board feels
that's an important deal point.

27:32.442 --> 27:34.986
Well, I was planning on
spending time with my family.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.363
Sweetie, I know.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.990
But it's not up to me. It's the board.

27:38.990 --> 27:42.452
You know what?
Tomorrow is our annual Vegas conference.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.245
Come, talk to some of them.

27:44.245 --> 27:46.247
Take my jet, bring your family.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.752
I mean...

27:54.005 --> 27:55.340
Amy, listen to me.

27:56.299 --> 27:59.302
I know this is not what you want.

27:59.302 --> 28:00.929
You want more.

28:02.430 --> 28:06.059
So just trust me.
You're gonna thank me later.

28:06.684 --> 28:08.061
So many toys.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.775
This is why we have wives.

28:19.572 --> 28:21.116
How much will the materials cost?

28:21.825 --> 28:26.663
Um, you know, if I was guessing,
100K, 120K, give or take.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.500
I mean, it's a lot,

28:30.500 --> 28:33.795
but we have been talking about
taking out a loan for renovations.

28:34.295 --> 28:36.589
It's the only way we can keep up
with megachurches.

28:36.589 --> 28:39.634
Right. I mean,
it is an investment for sure.

28:41.177 --> 28:43.179
And what's the cost of your labor?

28:44.222 --> 28:46.933
I'd be doing this pro bono for the church.

28:47.475 --> 28:50.228
- You're an angel. Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.313
Um, it was Edwin's idea, so...

28:53.648 --> 28:55.442
- I'll talk to the elders.
- Yes.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.569
- Appreciate it, Danny.
- Of course.

29:02.282 --> 29:05.201
That face.
No, you were perfect. You were perfect.

29:05.201 --> 29:09.873
I really felt like the spirit was moving
through all of us today, for sure.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.917
So I was thinking for next week, um,

29:12.917 --> 29:15.044
we'd start with "This I Believe,"

29:15.670 --> 29:19.215
and then maybe end with "Oceans," guys.

29:19.758 --> 29:23.553
Remember, we have practice at 7 p.m.,
the same rehearsal space--

29:23.553 --> 29:24.471
Danny.

29:25.805 --> 29:26.723
You still play?

29:28.850 --> 29:29.768
A little bit.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.979
Yeah, she showed up
at my house, unannounced.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.398
There's no way I can even
consider the offer, right?

29:35.398 --> 29:37.025
No, no. Of course not.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.153
But it is a really nice offer, though.

29:40.153 --> 29:41.529
Then, yeah.

29:41.529 --> 29:43.865
A nice offer should be considered,

29:43.865 --> 29:47.076
if that's, you know,
what you're considering.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.789
- That's the thing about--
- Uh, Mia, will you go stock the back?

29:50.789 --> 29:51.998
- Oh. Sure.
- Thanks.

29:56.711 --> 29:58.630
Uh, hi. Can I help you?

29:58.630 --> 30:01.549
Hey. I love the store.

30:01.549 --> 30:04.260
- Thank you. Anything I can help you with?
- Yes, actually.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.513
Does a Kayla Lexington work here?

30:06.513 --> 30:07.931
No.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.682
No, I've never heard of her.

30:10.892 --> 30:13.728
Oh. It's funny 'cause I-- I was, um--

30:14.270 --> 30:15.396
I just, uh--

30:17.482 --> 30:21.152
- Sorry for wasting your time.
- It's all right. Have a nice day.

30:22.612 --> 30:24.823
Hey, could you recommend a succulent

30:24.823 --> 30:28.034
that, like, don't need
no light, little water--?

30:28.034 --> 30:30.119
Here, take this, on the house.

30:31.204 --> 30:33.581
- Seriously? I don't know what to say.
Yeah.

30:33.581 --> 30:35.708
You don't have to say anything.
Just have a great day.

30:35.708 --> 30:38.169
Amy, you wanna take a look
at these new sansevieria.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.712
- Kayla. It's me.
- What?

30:39.712 --> 30:42.799
- Sir, you have to leave.
- Is this your asshole boss?

30:42.799 --> 30:44.259
Paul, come here.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.844
Okay.

30:46.469 --> 30:48.388
Her name is not Kayla. It's Mia.

30:48.388 --> 30:52.267
And I just screen-grabbed her photos
and sent them to you.

30:52.267 --> 30:55.854
Okay. So you were catfishing me?

30:55.854 --> 30:56.771
No. It--

30:59.065 --> 31:00.900
I don't know. Okay? I--

31:02.110 --> 31:03.278
I'm a mess.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.071
Okay?

31:07.115 --> 31:09.617
I guess I didn't want you
to know who I really am.

31:10.326 --> 31:13.663
I did really like talking to you, though.
I did, you know. You--

31:14.664 --> 31:17.584
You're gonna make
someone very happy one day.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.587
I know this isn't what you expected.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.714
I know I'm no fucking Kayla,

31:22.714 --> 31:25.758
with her perky tits and her taut ass.

31:25.758 --> 31:27.594
She's probably sopping wet--
