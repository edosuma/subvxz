01:55.983 --> 01:58.318
In Bahia, you find yourself

01:58.319 --> 02:00.987
in the heart of the heart of

02:00.988 --> 02:03.156
Brazil, where the
magic comes from.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.857
If you want to get there, just

02:04.858 --> 02:09.829
follow the sound of the drums.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.932
This is Salvadore de Bahia, city

02:12.933 --> 02:14.033
of three million people.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.169
First capital of Brazil.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.171
The wellspring for everything

02:18.172 --> 02:20.006
African and spicy, where things

02:20.007 --> 02:23.543
seem to just sway and
move constantly.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.545
It's a place where everybody is

02:25.546 --> 02:28.848
sexy, where even the
ugly people are hot.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.951
Unsurprisingly, this is
where artists come from.

02:31.952 --> 02:35.121
African spiritualism, cult

02:35.122 --> 02:39.359
magic, ondomble and caipirinhas.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.727
Did I mention caipirinhas?

02:40.728 --> 02:42.094
They do those here, too.

02:42.095 --> 02:42.430
I like them.

02:42.431 --> 02:46.032
I like them a lot.

02:46.033 --> 02:49.302
What's magical about this
cocktail is the first taste,

02:49.303 --> 02:51.204
it's like I don't know, man,

02:51.205 --> 02:53.039
it's a little too something.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.376
Then like that second sip, it's

02:56.377 --> 02:58.611
like oh, that's kind of good.

02:58.612 --> 03:06.319
Then the third sip, it's
where are my pants.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.288
Fortunately, food in these parts

03:08.289 --> 03:11.724
tends to be, shall
we say, hearty.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.426
For instance, a delightful meal

03:13.427 --> 03:16.663
of fried meat with plenty of

03:16.664 --> 03:21.000
absorbent starch product
like baropha, the perfect

03:21.001 --> 03:23.903
accompaniment to many,
many caipirinhas.

03:23.904 --> 03:24.238
Excellent.

03:24.239 --> 03:28.741
Now we're talking.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.010
Tough town for vegetarians.

Oh, good.

Yeah, man.

Tuesday nights are
very impressive.

I guess that's Brazil, right?

Yes, Brazil, but you have

16:05.398 --> 16:07.166

will tell you how if it's

consumed, you remain conscious

16:11.404 --> 16:12.871
while your muscles gradually

came here, I thought everybody

18:08.788 --> 18:12.224
in this city looks like they

18:12.225 --> 18:20.225
just got or they're on their
way to go...

18:24.671 --> 18:26.205
So this was the central

18:26.206 --> 18:27.306
market back before supermarkets,

18:27.307 --> 18:29.475
this is where everybody did
their shopping, right?

18:29.476 --> 18:32.511
Oh, yes.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.045
This is the real Brazil here.

18:34.046 --> 18:34.414
The real Bahia.

18:34.415 --> 18:38.650
Right.

18:38.651 --> 18:43.989
This place is fantastic.

18:43.990 --> 18:48.494
They sell oil and stuff,
this kind of oil, palm oil.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.761
Oh, yeah.

18:49.762 --> 18:50.896
Whoever you want to call it.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.531
I love the dende oil.

18:52.532 --> 18:53.732
It takes some getting used to.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.067
The first time I was here, you

18:56.068 --> 19:01.072
eat it, you... like a mink
for hours afterwards.

19:01.073 --> 19:01.674
Now, no problems.

19:01.675 --> 19:03.509
I've been eating this all week.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.010
Love it.

19:04.011 --> 19:12.011
You spend time in Brazil
you develop resistance.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.355
There you go.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.789
Hope you like spicy.

19:17.790 --> 19:18.725
He's a Brazilian guy.

19:18.726 --> 19:26.726
He's got to like spicy.

19:27.534 --> 19:27.934
A little cachaca.

19:27.935 --> 19:33.239
Oh, yes.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.208
That will set you right.

19:36.209 --> 19:44.209
That will protect you
from the poison.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.226
We're coming up to the world

19:54.227 --> 19:55.427
cup and I know a lot of people

19:55.428 --> 19:57.796
will be reading about
crime and all that.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.765
How do you think it's going
to go, the world cup?

19:59.766 --> 20:01.900
Disaster or it's going
to somehow work out?

20:01.901 --> 20:03.669
I think it will be a success.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.136
You think it will be a success.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.072
I'm sure of it.

20:06.073 --> 20:08.274
Salvador is one of the host

20:08.275 --> 20:10.576
cities for the 2014 world cup.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.811
A huge stadium has recently been

20:12.812 --> 20:15.681
completed, but a lot of people

20:15.682 --> 20:17.783
are worried, concerned,
if Brazil is ready.

20:17.784 --> 20:21.420
I have been told thousands
of prostitutes are studying

20:21.421 --> 20:23.088
tourist-appropriate languages in

20:23.089 --> 20:23.856
preparation, so probably a lot

20:23.857 --> 20:25.424
of people are going to get laid,

20:25.425 --> 20:26.958
a lot of people are going to get

20:26.959 --> 20:28.026
robbed, a lot of people are

20:28.027 --> 20:31.363
going to get laid and robbed.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.632
Have you ever been
here in carnival?

20:33.633 --> 20:37.168
No.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.770
The world cup is that carnival.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.439
That works out, right?

20:40.440 --> 20:41.940
That's not a slaughterfest.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.710
It's a breakfast.

20:44.711 --> 20:45.211
Right.

20:45.212 --> 20:46.445
Things happen but it works.

20:46.446 --> 20:52.017
Salvador in particular is
a place where... may I?

20:52.018 --> 20:52.352
Thank you.

20:52.353 --> 20:54.853
No matter what,
people should come.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.822
Even people who are afraid to

20:56.823 --> 20:59.458
travel, who say oh,
well, but I hear.

20:59.459 --> 21:02.328
No, you know what,
live your life, man.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.162
You should not miss a place like

21:04.163 --> 21:04.964
this, because there aren't a lot

21:04.965 --> 21:10.969
of places in the world that
even come close to this.

21:10.970 --> 21:17.809
Where we are today, I invited
you to have this dish.

21:17.810 --> 21:21.313
We are not born to die.

21:21.314 --> 21:24.983
I'm pretty sure Mr. Muffin
stuff over here is suddenly

21:24.984 --> 21:28.019
going to jump on me,
start clawing my face.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.188
The poison was
active, she's dead.

21:30.189 --> 21:33.224
I didn't think of that.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.594
We call you canary.

21:35.595 --> 21:36.329
We are not born for dying.

21:36.330 --> 21:39.866
No.

22:50.336 --> 22:55.674
The bay of all saints, a
vast natural harbor allowed

22:55.675 --> 22:56.775
Salvador to prosper.

22:56.776 --> 22:57.843
Tucked along its shore, if you

22:57.844 --> 22:59.277
look hard enough, you'll find a

22:59.278 --> 23:07.278
small grouping of shacks
roofed in corrugated tin.

23:07.319 --> 23:10.622
This is where a local
fishermen's association brings

23:10.623 --> 23:12.924
their catch to sell to
wholesalers, then relax after a

23:12.925 --> 23:16.094
long day on the water.

23:16.095 --> 23:21.032
Catch of the day, the
prized big red snapper.

23:21.033 --> 23:24.202
Rub with sea salt, lemon, olive

23:24.203 --> 23:25.171
oil, grill over charcoal.

23:25.172 --> 23:30.308
Enjoy view.

23:30.309 --> 23:36.949
So everybody here is fishermen?

23:37.950 --> 23:40.652
Meet Maloca, a very special guy.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.788
He's been working as our head of

23:42.789 --> 23:44.289
security and as for reasons that

23:44.290 --> 23:46.658
are immediately obvious, he

23:46.659 --> 23:50.361
enjoys respect and
reputation on the streets.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.663
But he also comes out of this

23:51.664 --> 23:53.164
neighborhood and these
guys are his friends.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.801
How's business now?

23:55.802 --> 23:56.636
Lot of fish out there?

23:56.637 --> 23:59.806
Fishing business good?

24:16.856 --> 24:18.056
Lunch wouldn't be complete

24:18.057 --> 24:19.858
without a delicious spicy salsa

24:19.859 --> 24:22.928
of garlic, tomato,
onions and peppers.

24:22.929 --> 24:27.232
On the side, some deep
fried little smelts.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.701
Don't forget the beer and
the cachaca and enjoy.

24:29.702 --> 24:32.037
That will work.

24:32.038 --> 24:34.740
Looks like a big grouper.

24:34.741 --> 24:42.741
It's a big redfish.

24:44.016 --> 24:48.386
I have to advise you
that... it's spicy.

24:48.387 --> 24:49.855
What do they drink,
beer or cachaca?

24:49.856 --> 24:57.856
Both.

25:03.202 --> 25:09.241
Still working?

He work more than all of us.

They use a line or net?

25:24.456 --> 25:25.957
A line.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.226
My secret is just the hand

25:28.227 --> 25:32.731
around a piece of wood like
that and take like that.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.966
They don't cut the hands?

25:34.967 --> 25:38.303
Always cut the hands.

25:38.304 --> 25:41.973
Fishing anywhere is hard and
the way these guys do it,

25:41.974 --> 25:43.308

Mostly hand lines

So tell me about kapuara.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.992
It was a kind of martial art

32:40.993 --> 32:42.393
but in the beginning of the

32:42.394 --> 32:44.495
century, it became more like a

32:44.496 --> 32:52.496
game and the music
instruments were associated.

32:57.843 --> 33:01.412
No hats, right?

33:01.413 --> 33:02.114
Why no hands?

33:02.115 --> 33:05.183
We use the hands in
just a few movements.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.018
Where did that come from and

33:07.019 --> 33:07.886
why do you think that became...

33:07.887 --> 33:12.957
Some people say that this
is inspired by the animal

33:12.958 --> 33:13.225
movements.

martial arts, of karate, muy

33:22.901 --> 33:26.971
Thai and tie Kwan Doe, capuara

33:26.972 --> 33:28.639
packed the most
ferocious impact.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.874
The leaders knew this and made

33:29.875 --> 33:35.213
it illegal for much
of Brazil's history.

33:35.214 --> 33:38.816
Today, it's taught in
classrooms and on stages.

33:38.817 --> 33:41.252
Originally it was a
male-dominated activity.

33:41.253 --> 33:43.221
When did that change?

33:43.222 --> 33:48.559
Since the '60s.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.794
We start in the beginning of the

33:49.795 --> 33:53.564
'80s and nowadays, we have
hundreds of women practice.

33:53.565 --> 33:56.501
What was it like in the
beginning, the very first women

33:56.502 --> 33:58.069
who did it?

33:58.070 --> 34:01.306
Mothers or fathers or
the family... right.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.674
Sad that capuara is not for

34:03.675 --> 34:07.912
women, why do you
decide to do this.

34:07.913 --> 34:09.580
Afro Brazilian cuisine is the

34:09.581 --> 34:10.947
result of many, many years of

34:10.949 --> 34:14.252
cooks experimenting with African

34:14.253 --> 34:15.585
and Portuguese dishes combined

34:15.587 --> 34:17.088
with local ingredients like

34:17.089 --> 34:19.757
seafood, chilies, coconut milk.

the rest of your life?

real fights, game and fight at

society, the women, they are not

34:59.998 --> 35:07.998
so well prepared like men.

35:12.844 --> 35:16.847
It was purely African in the
beginning, and now it's

35:16.848 --> 35:19.350
Afro-Brazilian form,
is that correct?

35:19.351 --> 35:21.018
All the instruments are
African instruments.

35:21.019 --> 35:23.020
Right.

35:23.021 --> 35:23.589
They're singing.

35:23.590 --> 35:25.490
A lot of singing,
and it's important.

35:25.491 --> 35:26.891
Yeah.

35:26.892 --> 35:27.159
Yeah.

35:27.160 --> 35:33.998
In Portuguese, but we in
capuara, we start to include

35:33.999 --> 35:38.703
music from multi-cultural
African cultural traditions

35:38.704 --> 35:45.243
including lyrics in
African language.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.077
All the things that we look

35:47.078 --> 35:51.081
at as Brazilian from outside

35:51.082 --> 35:55.052
looking in, the cuisine, samba,

35:55.053 --> 36:00.391
all of these things are
very African in origin.

36:00.392 --> 36:03.361
This is kind of where
that all started, yes?

36:03.362 --> 36:05.363
I mean, I don't want to
say it's the real Brazil.

36:05.364 --> 36:07.265
Everyone looks at Rio as the

36:07.266 --> 36:10.368
postcard Brazil, but here
it's really, you feel it.

36:10.369 --> 36:13.938
Those things.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.773
It has to do with this big

36:15.774 --> 36:19.944
concentration of Africans
since the beginning.

36:19.945 --> 36:26.552
It's different.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.521
If you, say, found yourself

37:36.522 --> 37:38.188
in Brazil and had a chance to

37:38.189 --> 37:39.524
hire a boat, head for the beach

37:39.525 --> 37:45.162
with a bunch of new friends,
bring along a skilled

37:45.163 --> 37:50.167
mixologist, expertly trained in

37:50.168 --> 37:53.237
the arts of drink making,
why wouldn't you?

37:53.238 --> 37:54.705
Charge across the water, headed

37:54.706 --> 37:57.308
for a nice, quiet island.

37:57.309 --> 38:00.311
Order up some sun to come out

38:00.312 --> 38:07.151
from some dark clouds
right about now.

38:07.152 --> 38:10.421
Sometimes cliches are
cliches for a reason.

38:10.422 --> 38:11.390
Because they're good ideas to

38:11.391 --> 38:14.224
start with, which is why people

38:14.225 --> 38:22.225
keep looking for them and
doing them over and over.

38:54.032 --> 38:57.602
In a perfect world upon
reaching said enchanted island,

38:57.603 --> 38:59.370
you jump into the warm Atlantic

38:59.371 --> 39:00.538
water, and if you could, you

39:00.539 --> 39:01.972
would have a classic soundtrack

39:01.973 --> 39:09.973
to this adventure, like
samba, for instance.

39:10.048 --> 39:11.549
Splash around for a while, maybe

39:11.550 --> 39:16.887
enjoy a nice cold beer or two.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.723
You truly have not taken a

39:18.724 --> 39:26.130
beach until a man has set
up the Caporina station.

39:26.131 --> 39:33.571
Then you know the lz is secure.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.773
I love nature.

39:35.774 --> 39:43.748
Oh what's going on here?

39:43.749 --> 39:46.851
Capoirina.

39:46.852 --> 39:47.085
Please.

39:47.086 --> 39:48.986
Sweet.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.421
This alone is an argument for

39:50.422 --> 39:57.762
the greatness of this country.

39:57.763 --> 39:59.930
And what goes great with
drinks on the beach?

39:59.931 --> 40:07.931
How about some barbecue?

40:21.487 --> 40:23.320
Please, don't eat me.

40:23.321 --> 40:24.455
Look in your heart.

40:24.456 --> 40:25.356
Don't eat me.

40:25.356 --> 40:25.624
Oh, no.

40:25.625 --> 40:33.397
Not my head.

40:33.398 --> 40:36.233
To complete the picture,
make a large fish.

40:36.234 --> 40:36.802
Maybe some crab.

40:36.803 --> 40:42.339
You know, anytime you get your

40:42.340 --> 40:44.709
Chinese, Brazilians and Italians

40:44.710 --> 40:46.076
all agreeing on something, it's

40:46.077 --> 40:47.978
really clear it's a good idea.

40:47.979 --> 40:51.982
Everybody agrees this complic
complicated creature with

40:51.983 --> 40:53.183
troublesome shells
is worth the work.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.519
Tear off the little limbs.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.487
We'll get to you a little
later, my friends.

40:56.488 --> 40:57.488
Rip out the tail.

40:57.489 --> 40:59.724
These are the lungs
you don't want them.

40:59.725 --> 41:03.894
Now you've got all this
nice fat in there.

41:03.895 --> 41:04.496
Oh, yeah.

41:04.497 --> 41:06.531
Now we're getting to the claw.

41:06.532 --> 41:08.165
Look at that.

41:08.166 --> 41:15.506
Let's poke him out of there.

41:15.507 --> 41:15.774
Oh, yeah.

41:15.775 --> 41:17.775
That little melon of goodness.

41:17.776 --> 41:22.913
Like a celestial nibble.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.782
When people started demanding

41:24.783 --> 41:30.087
boneless stuff like chicken
without a bone or crab meat

41:30.088 --> 41:31.388
without the actual crab.

41:31.389 --> 41:32.389
Or lazy lobster.

41:32.390 --> 41:34.224
That was the beginning of the

41:34.225 --> 41:35.626
erosion of our society
as we know it.

41:35.627 --> 41:36.761
If you're not willing to work

41:36.762 --> 41:38.529
for a payoff like this, how do

41:38.530 --> 41:42.099
you expect us to, like, fight Al

41:42.100 --> 41:45.870
qaeda if you can't suck
the meat out of a crab?

41:45.871 --> 41:47.071
Character builder.

41:47.072 --> 41:52.242
And delicious.

41:52.243 --> 41:55.479
And if your perfect day
really did happen, you would

41:55.480 --> 42:03.220
probably let yourself
be swept away.

42:03.221 --> 42:06.924
By liquor and good food and gin

42:06.925 --> 42:10.795
clear water, all all around you,

42:10.796 --> 42:12.963
Brazilians casually fondle each

42:12.964 --> 42:17.736
other, get all dozy
and fall asleep.
