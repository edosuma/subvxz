WHAT BALONEY?

13:41.612 --> 13:42.862
WHO'D YOU
SCORE AGAINST?

13:43.030 --> 13:44.697
YOU CAN'T PRACTICE
THAT WAY.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.783
YOU GOTTA PLAY
AGAINST SOMEBODY.

13:46.951 --> 13:50.328
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE
BOYS WE CAN PLAY AGAINST.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.746
YOU WILL ON SATURDAY.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.623
WAIT TILL YOU RUN
INTO THE DRAGONS.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.625
COME ON, SPENCE.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.463
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT,
YOU KNOW.

14:00.631 --> 14:03.758
IT AIN'T NO GOOD
UNLESS YOU GOT SOMEBODY
TO PRACTICE AGAINST.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.761
WELL, MAYBE SOME OF
US GIRLS CAN HELP.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.137
UH, THANKS, LAURA,

14:08.305 --> 14:10.974
BUT I'M AFRAID YOU
JUST AIN'T BIG ENOUGH.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.684
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
JONATHAN, WE ARE.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.645
WE COULD RUN A COUPLE
OF PLAYS WITH THEM.
WHAT DO YOU SAY, NELS?

14:15.813 --> 14:17.689
YEAH, SURE.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.357
THAT'S RIGHT KIND OF YOU, NOW.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.608
LUKE, COME ON OVER HERE.

14:20.776 --> 14:23.486
LET'S GET THAT FORMATION
LINED UP AGAIN.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.948

"V" FORMATION.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.116
LAURA, HOLD THAT, WILL YOU?

14:28.284 --> 14:29.492
WELL, YOU READY?
YOU BET.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.327
YEAH. I THINK
IT'S GOING TO BE FUN.

14:31.495 --> 14:34.330
I HAVEN'T PLAYED FOOTBALL SINCE
I WAS ON THE SCRUB TEAM
AT COLLEGE.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.915
WE'LL TAKE IT EASY ON YOU,
FELLAS.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.625
NOT TOO EASY, NOW.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.419
WE DON'T WANT TO HURT
ANY OF THOSE KIDS.
THEY'RE JUST KIDS.

14:39.587 --> 14:40.753
NO, BUT WE WANT TO GIVE
THEM A GOOD TEST.

14:40.921 --> 14:41.796
OH, YEAH.

14:41.964 --> 14:42.881
WE WILL.
WE'LL JUST GO EASY.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.757
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO.

14:44.925 --> 14:47.010
GET THOSE HEADS IN THERE
GOOD AND TIGHT.

14:47.177 --> 14:49.637
READY? GO!

14:53.058 --> 14:54.017
Boy: ALL RIGHT!

14:54.184 --> 14:57.520
Kids: YAY!

14:59.690 --> 15:00.773
YOU ALL RIGHT?

15:00.941 --> 15:03.943
YEAH. I THINK WE GOT
A FOOTBALL TEAM THERE.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.738
I WAS ONLY ON THE SCRUB TEAM.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.575
COME ON, LUKE.

15:13.078 --> 15:13.953
UH, YOU, BOY.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.039
OVER HERE.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.291
WHO, ME?

15:18.459 --> 15:20.126
YES, YOU.

15:26.717 --> 15:30.929
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T PLAY
IN THE GAME ON SATURDAY
IF YOU'RE OVER 16.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.972
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

15:33.140 --> 15:35.016

15:37.394 --> 15:39.479
WHAT'S YOUR NAME,
SON?

15:39.647 --> 15:41.189
LUKE HOSKINS.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.191
HOSKINS?

15:44.276 --> 15:47.695
I, UH, THINK
I KNOW YOUR FATHER.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.031
HIS NAME'S HOSKINS,
TOO.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.324
HMM?

15:51.492 --> 15:53.868
OH, SURE. SURE.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.913
AND, UH, WHICH HOSKINS
WOULD THAT BE?

15:57.081 --> 16:02.251
WELL, MY PA.
THE ONE THAT WORKS
AT MULDOON'S LIVERY.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.796
HE'S A SMITHY.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.756
OH, OF COURSE.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.007

16:08.175 --> 16:10.093

16:10.260 --> 16:12.470
I GOTTA GO PRACTICE.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.142
DO YOU MEAN
TO TELL ME,
NELS OLESON,

16:18.310 --> 16:19.936
THAT YOU WERE WILLING
TO CRIBBAGE

16:20.104 --> 16:21.354
WITH THAT OTHER TEAM?

16:21.522 --> 16:22.939
Nels: THE WORD IS
"SCRIMMAGE," HARRIET.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.732
OH, WELL, WHATEVER
YOU CALL IT.

16:24.900 --> 16:29.153
I CALL IT TREASON--
AIDING AND ABETTING
THE ENEMY.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.030
I AGREE
WITH MOTHER.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.283
WE'RE NOT AT WAR,
HARRIET.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.995
DON'T TRY TO CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.496
YOU ARE WILLING
TO HELP THE TEAM

16:38.664 --> 16:40.790
THAT'S PLAYING AGAINST
YOUR OWN SON.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.500
YOU'RE BETRAYING WILLIE.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.043
I DON'T CARE IF PA
HELPS THE OTHER TEAM.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.920
I NEVER GET TO PLAY
ON OURS ANYWAY.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.132
NOW, THAT'S ANOTHER
THING I DON'T LIKE
ABOUT WILLIE'S SCHOOL.

16:49.299 --> 16:51.134
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE
A CHANCE TO PLAY.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.803
YEAH, LIKE ON
THE LIVERY SCHOOL.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.638
I ALWAYS WANTED TO
GO TO THAT SCHOOL,

16:55.806 --> 16:59.100
BUT INSTEAD I GOT TO
WEAR THIS DOPEY OLD TIE.

16:59.268 --> 17:04.272
UGH. LIKE FATHER,
LIKE SON--BOTH
IMPOSSIBLE.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.524
HARRIET,
IT'S ONLY A GAME.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.652
HA! ONLY A GAME?

17:09.820 --> 17:12.280
NELS OLESON, SOMETIMES
I WONDER WHERE
YOUR HEAD IS.

17:12.448 --> 17:16.492
PEOPLE PLAY GAMES,
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?

17:16.660 --> 17:18.703
TO WIN, OF COURSE.
NOT TO LOSE.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.914
WHAT ABOUT PLAYING
FOR THE EXERCISE
AND FOR FUN?

17:22.082 --> 17:25.960
WINNING IS FUN, NELS.
LOSING IS EXERCISE.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.337
IT'S A LOT OF
WASTED MOTION.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.839
I AGREE
WITH MOTHER.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.382
Mrs. Oleson: YES.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.177
BUT IT'S NO FUN TO WIN
IF YOU DON'T PLAY.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.429
THAT'S NONSENSE, WILLIE.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.181
YOU'RE ON
THE WINNING TEAM.

17:38.348 --> 17:42.351
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
ALL DIRTY AND BRUISED,
DO YOU?

17:42.519 --> 17:44.270
I AGREE
WITH MOTHER.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.272
SHUT UP, NELLIE!

17:47.858 --> 17:49.150

17:57.534 --> 17:59.160

17:59.328 --> 18:01.829
EVERYBODY
LIKED IT TODAY.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.207
HERE, LAURA.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.875
SOMETHING THE MATTER,
CHARLES?

18:06.043 --> 18:08.586
I MUST HAVE PULLED
A MUSCLE WASHING
THE WINDOWS, I GUESS.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.214
THAT'S A FUNNY PLACE
TO PULL A MUSCLE.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.007
YEAH. I SUPPOSE
IT IS.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.383
HOW ARE THINGS GOING
AT SCHOOL, MARY?

18:14.551 --> 18:16.135
MOST OF THE STUDENTS
ARE DOING BEAUTIFULLY.

18:16.303 --> 18:19.138
YEAH. WITH ONE
BIG EXCEPTION--
TOM CARLIN.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.306
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

18:20.474 --> 18:22.100
IT'S HIS FATHER REALLY.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.769
I CAN'T GET TO HIM,
SO I CAN'T GET TO TOM.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.562
HE JUST SITS
AND MOPES ALL DAY.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.523
I'M SURE YOU'LL
FIND A WAY.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.066
I'M AFRAID YOU
AND MARY BOTH HAVE

18:30.234 --> 18:33.611
A LOT MORE CONFIDENCE
IN ME THAN I HAVE,
MRS. INGALLS.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.154
HEY. HOW ABOUT
YOUR SCHOOL, LAURA?

18:35.322 --> 18:38.324
I HEAR YOU'RE PLAYING
THE DAKOTA DRAGONS
ON SATURDAY.

18:38.492 --> 18:39.450
WHO'S GONNA WIN?

18:39.618 --> 18:41.911
WE WILL!

18:42.079 --> 18:43.663
Mary: WHAT'S THE NAME
OF YOUR TEAM?

18:43.831 --> 18:46.457
HEY. THAT'S RIGHT.
WE HAVEN'T PICKED
ONE YET.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.793
WE GOT TO HAVE A NAME
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO
MAKE PENNANTS.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.295
MOM, WILL YOU HELP
ME AND THE OTHER GIRLS
MAKE THEM?

18:51.463 --> 18:52.755
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.925
WELL, DOES ANYBODY
HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS
FOR THE NAME?

18:56.093 --> 18:58.636
THE MARAUDERS.

18:58.804 --> 18:59.762
THE SNAKES!

18:59.930 --> 19:02.098
HEY. I LIKE THAT.
THE SNAKES!

19:02.266 --> 19:03.266
HOW ABOUT

19:07.020 --> 19:09.105

GOOD SUGGESTION,

IN HONOR OF ALL
THE BRAVE INDIANS

IN THE FIRST PLACE?

19:19.783 --> 19:20.658
Charles:
IT'S A GOOD NAME.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.118
I LIKE THE RING
TO IT.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.620
BESIDES, IT'S
A LOT BETTER THAN
THE WINOKA BURPS.

19:24.788 --> 19:27.582
THE WINOKA WARRIORS
IT IS!

19:27.749 --> 19:30.501

OUR STAR PLAYER.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.259
DID HE GET HURT?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.011
NO. WE GOT HURT.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.387
HE GOT FREE TUITION,

19:41.555 --> 19:45.474
AND NOW HE'S GOING
TO THE OTHER SCHOOL.

20:08.790 --> 20:14.128
WELL, WE WON'T HAVE
TO MAKE ANY PENNANTS.

WINNING THAT COUNTS.

20:23.138 --> 20:25.681

PLAY THE GAME.

NO POINT IN YOU

TO APPLY YOURSELF.

REAL HARD, AND...

21:52.436 --> 21:55.896

IS JUST A FACT.

ABOUT SOMETHING I CAN'T
DO ANYTHING ABOUT.

24:20.584 --> 24:23.586
THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT
THE GAME SATURDAY.

24:23.753 --> 24:25.671
PRACTICE DIDN'T
GO TOO GOOD, HUH?

24:25.839 --> 24:27.590
WHAT PRACTICE?

24:27.757 --> 24:29.592
IT WAS A DISASTER.

24:29.759 --> 24:33.429
WITHOUT LUKE HOSKINS,
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE
A TEAM.

24:33.597 --> 24:38.058
WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS
A BIG GUY FOR THE POINT
OF THAT "V."

24:38.226 --> 24:39.935
CAN'T YOU RELY
ON TRICKY PLAYS,

24:40.103 --> 24:41.604
OR WHAT ABOUT SPEED?

24:41.771 --> 24:44.690
THEY'VE HAD ALL YEAR
TO PRACTICE.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.775
WE ONLY HAVE A WEEK.

24:46.943 --> 24:52.031
WITH LUKE, ALL WE HAD
TO DO WAS HOLD ON
AND GO STRAIGHT.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.574
WELL, WHAT YOU NEED
IS ANOTHER BIG KID.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.409
WHO'S THE BIGGEST KID
IN YOUR SCHOOL?

24:55.577 --> 24:57.244
CINDY LOU HERRON.

24:57.412 --> 24:58.913
SHE'S NOT ALLOWED
TO PLAY.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.582
HA HA HA!

25:01.750 --> 25:04.919
THERE JUST
AREN'T ANY BIG BOYS
AROUND HERE.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.630
YES, THERE IS. ONE.

25:07.797 --> 25:09.798
HIS NAME'S BIG,
DUMB LUKE HOSKINS,

25:09.966 --> 25:13.844
AND HE'S PLAYING FOR
THE DAKOTA DRAGONS.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.596
MR. INGALLS...

25:15.764 --> 25:17.264
COULD YOU GIVE ME A RIDE
OUT TO THE CARLIN FARM

25:17.432 --> 25:19.767
TOMORROW MORNING
BEFORE SCHOOL?

25:19.935 --> 25:21.393
SURE ENOUGH.

25:21.561 --> 25:24.772
YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND
ABOUT TRYING TO GET
TOM BACK IN SCHOOL?

25:24.940 --> 25:26.524
YES, SIR.

25:26.691 --> 25:29.318
SEEMS WITH ALL THE TROUBLES
THE WINOKA WARRIORS ARE HAVING,

25:29.486 --> 25:32.196
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT
FOR ME TO GIVE UP.

25:49.714 --> 25:50.839
Charles:
MORNING, MR. CARLIN.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.175
MORNING.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.761
MR. CARLIN, I'VE GOT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT TOM.

25:55.929 --> 25:57.471
I'VE SAID EVERYTHING
THAT COULD BE SAID.

25:57.639 --> 26:00.766
NOT BY A FAR SIGHT,
YOU HAVEN'T.

26:00.934 --> 26:04.144
A LOT MORE HAS TO BE SAID
AND DONE.

26:04.312 --> 26:08.148
I'VE HEARD EVERYTHING
I'M GOING TO HEAR
ABOUT THE BOY.

26:08.316 --> 26:10.150
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

26:10.318 --> 26:13.279
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY
HEARD ANYTHING.

26:13.446 --> 26:16.699
YOU'VE SHUT YOUR EARS
AND CLOSED YOUR EYES.

26:16.866 --> 26:20.369
YOU KNOW, IN SOME WAYS
YOU'RE BLINDER THAN TOM IS.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.538
I'M NOT
GOING TO LISTEN.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.795
TAKE ME TO HIM,
MR. INGALLS.

26:32.382 --> 26:34.383
I'M WITH YOU, SON.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.020
Mr. Carlin: I TOLD YOU
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

26:46.187 --> 26:50.149
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU FEEL,
MR. CARLIN,

26:50.317 --> 26:51.734
BECAUSE AFTER
I WENT BLIND,

26:51.901 --> 26:55.195
MY FATHER TREATED ME
THE SAME WAY YOU'RE
TREATING TOM--

26:55.363 --> 26:59.074
AS IF HE WAS
SOME KIND OF FREAK,

26:59.242 --> 27:01.910
AS IF HE'D COMMITTED
SOME KIND OF
UNFORGIVABLE SIN

27:02.078 --> 27:04.121
JUST BY LOSING
HIS SIGHT.

27:05.582 --> 27:08.292
YOU'RE ASHAMED OF HIM,
AREN'T YOU?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.794
HE'S MY SON.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.588
YES.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.759
THAT MAKES IT WORSE,
DOESN'T IT?

27:16.926 --> 27:19.511
IT MAKES YOU
FEEL GUILTY.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.764
YOU DON'T LIKE
THAT FEELING.

27:23.058 --> 27:26.018
I'M TAKING CARE OF HIM
THE BEST I CAN.

27:26.186 --> 27:30.064
AND WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM
AFTER YOU'RE GONE?

27:30.231 --> 27:33.776
WHO'S GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF HIM THEN IF HE CAN'T
FEND FOR HIMSELF?

27:35.236 --> 27:37.071
I SENT HIM TO SCHOOL.

27:37.238 --> 27:39.448
WHY?

27:39.616 --> 27:41.492
WHY DID YOU SEND HIM?

27:42.744 --> 27:43.577
I TOLD YOU.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.663
BECAUSE I PROMISED
HIS MOTHER.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.124
I THINK YOU'RE A LIAR.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.795
HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT
TO ME?

27:52.962 --> 27:54.296
I SAID IT ONCE
TO MY OWN FATHER.

27:54.464 --> 27:56.256
I CAN SAY IT TO YOU.

27:58.635 --> 27:59.802
I LOVE MY SON.

27:59.969 --> 28:02.012
AND I LOVE MY FATHER,

28:02.180 --> 28:03.430
BUT WHEN YOU LIVE
IN THE DARK,

28:03.598 --> 28:07.726
THE ONLY LIGHT
THERE IS IS TRUTH.

28:07.894 --> 28:11.480
YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT
THAN MY FATHER,
MR. CARLIN.

28:11.648 --> 28:17.069
YOU SENT TOM TO SCHOOL
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TO LOOK AT HIM.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.320
NO.

28:18.488 --> 28:21.323
IN THE NAME OF GOD,
WOULD YOU TELL
THE TRUTH?

28:21.491 --> 28:24.743
AT LEAST THEN WE
CAN HAVE SOME KIND
OF BEGINNING!

28:24.911 --> 28:26.870
YOU THINK YOU'RE
THE ONLY HUMAN BEING
IN THE WORLD

28:27.038 --> 28:29.206
WHO EVER FELT
THIS WAY?

28:31.835 --> 28:34.670
IF YOU JUST
SAY IT ONCE...

28:34.838 --> 28:38.215
"I CAN'T STAND
TO LOOK AT MY SON."

28:39.509 --> 28:40.843
JUST SAY IT.

28:41.010 --> 28:43.804
"I CAN'T STAND
TO LOOK AT MY SON."

28:43.972 --> 28:46.557
I CAN'T STAND
TO LOOK AT MY SON!

28:54.357 --> 28:56.191
GOD FORGIVE ME.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.237
I'M SORRY.

29:12.375 --> 29:14.251
NOW WE CAN BOTH
HELP HIM.

29:16.671 --> 29:18.255
WHAT CAN WE DO?

29:20.550 --> 29:23.260
FIRST,
GIVE HIM A FEELING
HE'S A MAN...

29:24.471 --> 29:27.181
THAT HE CAN ACCOMPLISH
SOMETHING--

29:27.348 --> 29:29.808
ANYTHING--

29:29.976 --> 29:33.479
THAT HE'S NOT
AS DIFFERENT AS
HE THINKS HE IS.

29:33.646 --> 29:34.897
WE CAN'T DO THAT,
MR. CARLIN,

29:35.064 --> 29:37.316
UNLESS WE GET HIM
BACK TO SCHOOL,

29:37.484 --> 29:39.610
AND THAT'S UP TO YOU.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.612
YOU CAN MAKE HIM.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.667
HE'S IN THE HOUSE.

29:55.835 --> 29:57.669
I'LL GO AND GET HIM.

30:06.930 --> 30:09.139
YOU REALLY ARE
SOMETHING, SON.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.784
STOP AT THE LIVERY
SCHOOL PLEASE,
MR. INGALLS.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.077
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

30:30.245 --> 30:33.288
YOU WILL, MR. INGALLS.
YOU WILL.

30:34.707 --> 30:38.836
IN 1869, WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE WAS
ENACTED BY WYOMING TERRITORY,

30:39.003 --> 30:41.296
THE FIRST POLITICAL BODY
TO TAKE THAT STEP.

30:41.464 --> 30:43.298
MOST MEN ASSUMED THE LADIES
WOULD STAY AT HOME--

30:43.466 --> 30:45.175
EXCUSE ME.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.219
SORRY TO INTERRUPT
YOUR CLASS, MRS. GARVEY,

30:47.387 --> 30:52.307
BUT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE
A NEW TEMPORARY STUDENT--
TOM CARLIN.

30:52.475 --> 30:54.518
LAURA? ALBERT?

30:54.686 --> 30:57.563
YOU SAID YOU NEEDED
A BIG MAN FOR YOUR TEAM.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.731
WELL, YOU GOT ONE.

31:02.151 --> 31:04.695
ALL RIGHT, TEAM. LET'S GET INTO
THAT "V" FORMATION.

31:04.863 --> 31:08.282
TOM, I WANT YOU TO GET
RIGHT HERE.

31:08.449 --> 31:11.410
HERE'S THE BALL. FEEL THAT?

31:11.578 --> 31:14.288
GET DOWN. DOWN.

31:14.455 --> 31:16.248
NOW, WHEN ALBERT SAYS "BALL,"

31:16.416 --> 31:18.500
YOU HAND THE BALL
RIGHT BACK TO THERE.

31:18.668 --> 31:19.710
YOU FEEL THAT?

31:19.878 --> 31:22.004
AND THEN YOU PLOW
STRAIGHT AHEAD, ALL RIGHT?

31:22.171 --> 31:23.213
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.591
I CAN'T. I CAN'T
DO IT, MR. GARVEY.

31:25.758 --> 31:26.717
SURE YOU CAN, SON.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.594
YOU GOT THE SIZE
AND THE STRENGTH.

31:28.761 --> 31:31.221
ALL YOU NEED NOW
IS THE DRIVE.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.390
BUT I CAN'T SEE
ANYTHING.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.602
TELL HIM TO DO IT.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.856
SON, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SEE ANYTHING.

31:41.024 --> 31:41.899
YOU JUST DON'T HAVE TO.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.901
YOU'RE KIND OF LIKE...

31:44.068 --> 31:45.694
LIKE A TEAM IN FRONT
OF A WAGON,

31:45.862 --> 31:48.488
AND YOUR TEAMMATES ARE
GOING TO HAVE A HOLD
OF YOU RIGHT LIKE THIS,

31:48.656 --> 31:51.033
AND THEY'RE GOING
TO POINT YOU IN
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.409
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SEE NOTHING.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.535
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
FELLAS?

31:53.703 --> 31:55.078
Boys: RIGHT!

31:55.246 --> 31:59.041
RIGHT. OK.
LET'S GET DOWN NOW.
WE'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

31:59.208 --> 32:00.918
DOWN LIKE THAT.

32:01.085 --> 32:04.296
NELS, CHARLES, COME ON.

32:05.548 --> 32:08.675
DON'T BE EASY ON HIM.
WE HAVE TO PUSH HIM.

32:08.843 --> 32:10.510
ALL RIGHT.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.683
WELL, LET'S GIVE IT A TRY.

32:18.603 --> 32:19.603

32:19.771 --> 32:20.687
LET'S GO!

LET GO OF ME!
LET GO OF ME!

32:24.233 --> 32:25.525
I CAN'T SEE!

32:25.693 --> 32:27.819
I CAN'T DO IT.
LEAVE ME ALONE.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.950
PLEASE. LEAVE ME ALONE.

32:33.117 --> 32:34.868
I CAN'T DO IT.

32:35.036 --> 32:38.413
WELL, I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE RIGHT, TOM.

32:38.581 --> 32:40.374
YOU CAN'T.

32:41.751 --> 32:44.836
I GUESS I THOUGHT
YOU WERE A LOT TOUGHER
THAN YOU ARE.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.257
HEY, YOU'RE RIGHT, ADAM.

32:49.425 --> 32:51.468
HE COULDN'T MAKE THE TEAM
IF HE COULD SEE.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.261
RIGHT.

32:53.429 --> 32:55.806
THE BIGGER THEY ARE,
THE HARDER THEY FALL.

33:08.444 --> 33:10.237
MR. GARVEY?

33:10.405 --> 33:12.072
RIGHT HERE, TOM.

33:14.283 --> 33:15.742

33:24.168 --> 33:26.420
Mr. Garvey: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY.

33:26.587 --> 33:27.462
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GUYS READY?

33:27.630 --> 33:29.214

Laura: OH, MA.

34:09.881 --> 34:12.758
IT'S LATE, AND YOU ALL
NEED YOUR SLEEP FOR
THE BIG GAME TOMORROW.

34:12.925 --> 34:14.051
PLEASE, JUST
A FEW MORE MINUTES

34:14.218 --> 34:17.345
SO I CAN FINISH
THIS ONE LAST PENNANT?

34:17.513 --> 34:19.806
ALL RIGHT, BUT THEN
THAT'S THE LAST ONE.

34:19.974 --> 34:21.224
THANKS, MA.

34:21.392 --> 34:23.226
I SURE WISH

34:36.365 --> 34:39.409
YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING
TO BE A LOT DIFFERENT

34:39.577 --> 34:42.370

IN THERE AGAINST US.

34:42.538 --> 34:45.040
REMEMBER, HE RAN
OVER YOUR PAS, TOO.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.834
WELL, AT LEAST WE'LL GIVE
THEM A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY,

34:48.002 --> 34:50.545
I HOPE SO.
IT'S MY MONEY.

IT'S YOUR FAULT FOR
BETTING, AND YOU KNOW IT.

WE'LL GET LUCKY.

35:37.927 --> 35:40.554
THEY WAITED AS LONG
AS THEY COULD,
THEN THEY LEFT.

NOT TILL 11 :00.

35:44.100 --> 35:47.602

TO GET TO THE FIELD.

35:52.358 --> 35:53.817
THEY CHANGED IT.

TO PLAY IN THAT FIELD
WAY OVER IN HENDERSON.

YOU NEVER HEAR ANYTHING.

MR. STANDISH SEES IN A BIG,
DUMB OX LIKE YOU.
