00:04.780 --> 00:06.580
Why don't you want to talk to me?

00:07.340 --> 00:10.560
I think I was raped by William's brother.

00:11.400 --> 00:15.880
Is there no one else you can ask?
Someone who was at the party?

00:15.980 --> 00:21.400
There was a girl from our school. Mari.

00:24.460 --> 00:26.460
Tell me you didn't sleep with my brother.

00:27.540 --> 00:29.040
I don't know.

00:57.480 --> 00:58.460
Yes?

01:00.720 --> 01:01.720
Hi.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.740
Hi.

01:05.240 --> 01:07.500
Are you up for a visit from a friend?

01:24.400 --> 01:25.880
What are you doing?

01:26.060 --> 01:31.500
I'm just throwing
out a lot of shit I don't need.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.160
You had such long hair.

02:04.180 --> 02:05.540
When is this from?

02:12.300 --> 02:13.940
Ninth grade.

02:23.300 --> 02:25.680
Have you heard something from William?

02:36.480 --> 02:42.120
Eva talked to Penetrator Chris,
and he said William has gone to London.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.820
His father lives there.

02:51.460 --> 02:55.840
I'm sure it's just for the weekend.
They have exams next week.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.660
He has to take the exam.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.380
I will talk to Mari tomorrow.

03:19.340 --> 03:20.280
You will?

03:22.140 --> 03:26.000
I sent her a message asking if we could talk.

03:28.440 --> 03:34.080
We'll just cross our fingers hoping she's a little cool.

03:37.540 --> 03:40.500
Just not so cool that
I would've slept with her as well.

03:50.420 --> 03:51.820
What do you want to find out?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.640
Are you hungry?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.340
Eh, no.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.540
I've made something nice for you.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.160
Vilde, I've already eaten.

04:16.480 --> 04:17.980
Do you like tortilla?

04:22.020 --> 04:26.700
What's so good about tortilla,
is that it's made from potatoes.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.940
And your body needs potatoes.

04:37.380 --> 04:43.420
Because potatoes have
lots of starch, which give you energy.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.580
And vitamin C,
which is an antioxidant.

04:55.300 --> 04:59.580
Antioxidants help you
so you don't get old skin.

05:01.700 --> 05:05.000
You don't want to have old skin
when you get together with William again.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.600
Then we need to eat tortilla!

06:04.640 --> 06:15.240
<i>[He didn't show up to his exam today. Chris says he
can't reach him either.]</i>

06:15.320 --> 06:16.180
What's up?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.020
Hi.

06:25.620 --> 06:30.760
Thank you for wanting to meet me.
-Of course.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.860
You're paranoid about
Nico's party?

06:43.820 --> 06:44.640
Yes.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.740
Don't be. You were just sweet.

06:56.860 --> 06:58.880
Do you know if I slept with Nico?

07:01.020 --> 07:01.980
No.

07:04.420 --> 07:05.700
You don't know.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.900
No, you didn't.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.420
Are you sure?

07:14.080 --> 07:14.960
Yes.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.880
But... oh my god. Okay.

07:24.020 --> 07:27.740
But did I sleep with someone else?
-No.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.600
You were really stressed out, weren't you?

07:33.880 --> 07:38.400
Yeah, I woke up naked!
-You undressed yourself!

07:39.520 --> 07:41.960
I got undressed?!

07:43.880 --> 07:45.680
You seriously don't remember anything?

07:46.180 --> 07:50.300
No! Can you just explain everything now?

07:51.880 --> 07:55.900
Okay. Do you remember
throwing up on the sofa upstairs?

07:57.080 --> 07:58.140
No...

07:59.740 --> 08:04.540
You threw up on the sofa upstairs.
I took you to the toilet.

08:04.740 --> 08:09.420
You threw up again,
so we drank some water.

08:09.660 --> 08:14.000
Then you said you wanted
to lie in William's bed. Remember that?

08:17.460 --> 08:18.620
No...

08:19.720 --> 08:22.780
You were really obsessing over William.

08:24.860 --> 08:25.880
How so?

08:27.680 --> 08:30.700
You said you loved him...

08:30.940 --> 08:38.860
... and that he wasn't good because he was an asshole. You didn't
want to be that girl who falls for such a guy.

08:40.220 --> 08:44.840
You smelled his pillow and said it
smelled like him. You wanted to sleep in his bed...

08:45.100 --> 08:49.220
... and you began to undress yourself completely.

08:53.960 --> 09:02.860
You said last time you were in his bed,
he said that all your clothes would be off within two weeks.

09:03.080 --> 09:08.040
You said it wasn't going to happen,
but that he had meant it.

09:08.360 --> 09:12.480
But that really deep inside
you hoped he was right.

09:12.880 --> 09:18.340
Now he had been right in a way.
Then you passed out.

09:30.260 --> 09:33.880
But I woke up in bed next to Nico.

09:35.540 --> 09:38.300
Yeah, but he came in much later.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.200
But how do you
know he didn't do anything?

09:46.680 --> 09:54.160
Because when Nico came, I was awake. I asked him to go
lie somewhere else. But then he passed out and fell asleep.

09:56.840 --> 10:00.480
But maybe he did
something while you were sleeping.

10:02.460 --> 10:03.460
Noora...

10:04.520 --> 10:09.820
Nico was really fucked up. He wouldn't have even
managed to get a boner.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.660
Just forget it, really.

10:13.520 --> 10:16.060
I would have noticed if
someone had sex next to me.

10:17.020 --> 10:18.600
You didn't sleep with Nico.

10:19.420 --> 10:20.880
I'm totally sure.

10:27.340 --> 10:29.100
But he took pictures of me.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.040
What kind of pictures?

10:33.920 --> 10:37.040
Naked pictures. While I was asleep.

10:37.940 --> 10:39.180
Are you kidding?

10:40.600 --> 10:41.820
I reported him.

10:43.260 --> 10:45.960
Nico, poor guy.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.840
Poor guy? Seriously?

10:53.320 --> 10:57.200
I remember when I was little,
I used to be scared of him.

10:57.520 --> 11:02.260
I'm not scared of him any longer.
I think I just pity him.

11:02.440 --> 11:05.400
But not like that. It was right
of you to report him.

11:07.020 --> 11:11.460
Did you know him when you were little?

11:13.580 --> 11:18.820
I went to kindergarten with Amalie,
his little sister. She was my best friend.

11:21.760 --> 11:22.900
Oh yeah?

11:25.820 --> 11:33.200
I know Nico hasn't had an easy life.
He has a different father than William and Amalie.

11:33.600 --> 11:39.880
His real father never wanted anything
to do with him. Neither did William and Amalie's father.

11:40.220 --> 11:44.300
And their mother is
just really cowardly and weak.

11:45.100 --> 11:51.440
When Nico was little he got
these really sick tantrums. He snapped completely.

11:52.060 --> 11:58.820
Instead of trying to calm him down and
understand him, his mom would lock him in his room.

11:59.120 --> 12:06.380
Music at full blast, so no one would hear him. She went
around smiling nervously and pretending nothing had happened.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.160
It was really intereseting to
have dinner there, so to speak.

12:15.760 --> 12:21.260
After the accident she just
really abandoned both her sons.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.560
Just left them to the au pairs.

12:27.020 --> 12:30.040
I know Nico doesn't have any contact with her.

12:30.800 --> 12:34.060
I don't think William has, either.
If he does, it's not much.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.140
Accident?

12:51.300 --> 12:54.300
When Nico was eleven...

12:55.240 --> 12:58.720
... he stole his stepdad's
car and crashed it into a cliff.

12:59.580 --> 13:01.920
With William and Amalie in it.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.760
It wasn't his intention.
He was just a kid.

13:05.900 --> 13:11.320
But Amalie broke
her back and died.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.620
Fucking hell...

13:26.080 --> 13:31.560
Yeah, it's quite dark.
They were eight years old.

13:35.160 --> 13:38.820
After that, pretty much
the whole family was fucked up.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.080
But William is a good guy.

13:47.340 --> 13:53.500
I understand you think he's an asshole,
but he's actually really sensitive.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.440
He just keeps everything inside.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.660
Does it sting?
-It itches.

14:05.820 --> 14:08.500
It stings when I touch it.

14:08.780 --> 14:10.180
You can't touch it.

14:10.720 --> 14:13.240
That's why you got it.
-Huh?

14:13.240 --> 14:15.640
If you touch there, you get it there.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.260
What are you talking about?
-You can't touch it on your fiffi.

14:19.660 --> 14:20.520
Fiffi?

14:20.820 --> 14:22.560
It's Swedish for vagina.

14:25.660 --> 14:25.720
<i>[Hello. I was down in our basement and it looks like someone
is living and sleeping there. There's a mattress, a duvet,
pillows and stuff on the floor. Do you know anything about it?]</i>

14:25.720 --> 14:28.900
On (pocketdoctor.com) it says you can get chlamydia in your eye.
<i>[Hello. I was down in our basement and it looks like someone

14:28.900 --> 14:30.980
<i>[Hello. I was down in our basement and it looks like someone
is living and sleeping there. There's a mattress, a duvet,
pillows and stuff on the floor. Do you know anything about it?]</i>

14:30.980 --> 14:35.120
How did I get chlamydia in my eye?
<i>[Hello. I was down in our basement and it looks like someone

14:35.120 --> 14:37.180
<i>[Hello. I was down in our basement and it looks like someone

14:39.820 --> 14:43.640
<i>[No.]</i>

14:43.640 --> 14:45.120
Don't touch me!

14:46.860 --> 14:49.600
I promise it's not chlamydia.

14:49.760 --> 14:49.820
<i>[I did not sleep with Nico!]</i>

14:49.820 --> 14:51.300
But who did you have sex with?
<i>[I did not sleep with Nico!]</i>

14:51.300 --> 14:52.760
<i>[I went to you that night to talk to you...
Nico had a party and said a lot of crap about you, I drank wine and blacked out!]</i>

14:52.760 --> 14:55.640
Had sex with?
-Yeah, you said you had sex with him.
<i>[I went to you that night to talk to you...
Nico had a party and said a lot of crap about you, I drank wine and blacked out!]</i>

14:55.640 --> 14:55.960
<i>[I went to you that night to talk to you...
Nico had a party and said a lot of crap about you, I drank wine and blacked out!]</i>

14:55.960 --> 14:57.780
After the party.
<i>[I can explain everything. The important part is nothing happened. Please reply. I love you.]</i>

14:57.780 --> 14:59.420
<i>[I can explain everything. The important part is nothing happened. Please reply. I love you.]</i>

14:59.560 --> 15:02.180
Vilde, I didn't say we had sex.
I just said...

15:02.720 --> 15:07.100
... that he fingered me a little
in the taxi. We didn't have sex.

15:07.220 --> 15:11.040
William's at school! He went into
the headmaster's office.

15:18.580 --> 15:21.020
Excuse me, I was just wondering...
Is William...

15:41.340 --> 15:43.320
You haven't replied to my messages.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.440
My phone was dead.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.280
I didn't sleep with your brother.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.480
Can we talk?

16:42.200 --> 16:43.560
I'm moving...

16:47.120 --> 16:48.100
... to London.

17:03.580 --> 17:04.740
Listen up.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.960
William Magnusson.

17:12.020 --> 17:13.660
You're a smart guy.

17:16.980 --> 17:18.840
So you ought to understand...

17:19.700 --> 17:25.880
... that I would never just
let you move to London.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.700
Not before we've talked.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.200
So if you really want to get rid of me...

17:36.940 --> 17:38.800
You should meet me for a talk.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.480
Stop feeling so
damn sorry for yourself.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.220
Okay.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.760
I'll text you.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.700
<i>[I'm outside of your apartment now. You
wanted to talk? I don't have much time.]</i>

20:18.900 --> 20:22.560
You weren't kidding when
you said you don't have much time.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.480
Plane leaves at six.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.020
You want to talk?

20:52.540 --> 20:54.360
Why do you have to go to London?

20:58.340 --> 20:59.620
Because I want to.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.720
How long will you be there?

21:13.700 --> 21:15.280
I think the rest of my life.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.800
What about us?

21:34.640 --> 21:35.780
What about us?

21:42.960 --> 21:44.380
Is it just over?

21:47.600 --> 21:48.400
Yes.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.520
Just like that?

21:59.740 --> 22:01.320
I'm not in love with you.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.060
You are...

22:23.720 --> 22:26.340
You are in love with me...

22:31.440 --> 22:33.060
That's why you're being so cold.

22:36.860 --> 22:37.960
No, Noora.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.360
I'm cold because that's how I am.

22:53.740 --> 22:58.020
I always wondered why you're so smart.

23:00.320 --> 23:03.820
Just to defend your asshole
behavior to yourself?

23:07.620 --> 23:11.000
You just tell yourself that's how you are?

23:21.180 --> 23:23.700
Is it because your mom is a cunt?

23:25.880 --> 23:28.500
Because you had a tragic childhood?

23:32.860 --> 23:40.460
Is that what you say to yourself? That you feel so sorry
for yourself that you just can't fault your own behavior?

23:48.260 --> 23:49.840
Anyway, it's not true.

23:52.720 --> 23:59.320
People experience horrible things every day,
and they still manage to be nice to others.

24:01.240 --> 24:08.060
Being an asshole is not something
you're born with, or something you become.

24:08.620 --> 24:10.020
It's a choice.

24:15.800 --> 24:20.480
It's also a choice to let
Nico destroy what there is between us.

24:28.580 --> 24:31.020
What's the plan?

24:31.280 --> 24:36.340
Were you just gonna go around London being
an asshole, because your brother is mean?

24:37.480 --> 24:40.300
Because your girl lied to you?

24:43.800 --> 24:48.460
Are you never letting anyone in
again because you might get hurt?

25:02.580 --> 25:06.580
Believe me...
You don't want that.

25:11.020 --> 25:12.500
It's really lonely.

25:30.660 --> 25:32.300
Because people...

25:35.180 --> 25:36.260
... need people.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.100
I love you.

25:51.540 --> 25:53.160
And you love me.

26:02.500 --> 26:03.700
We have to be together.

26:23.180 --> 26:25.040
Tell me we should be together.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.440
I have to go.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.620
Eva?

27:34.840 --> 27:36.740
William has left.

27:39.280 --> 27:44.720
William broke up with me.
William has left to London.

27:44.820 --> 27:46.520
Fuck, he left to...

27:48.680 --> 27:54.180
He came here. We were going to meet.
He came here...

27:55.860 --> 28:03.200
... in Chris' car. He said he wasn't in love with
me anymore, and his flight would leave at six.

28:06.460 --> 28:09.980
No, he said he
wasn't in love with me anymore.

28:14.980 --> 28:21.160
Because he wanted to...
Can I come to you?
