WEBVTT

00:06.139 --> 00:10.110
Dave, what are we doing
in this ritzy store?

00:10.176 --> 00:14.013
Smells like trust funds
and white-collar crime in here.

00:14.080 --> 00:14.881
I know,

00:14.948 --> 00:15.882
but I need some
new shirts for work,

00:15.949 --> 00:19.052
and Haberdashery L.A.
is the hot new place.

00:19.119 --> 00:20.620
They say it's for the modern,

00:20.687 --> 00:22.455
yet classic gentleman.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.391
Then what are you doing here?

00:26.493 --> 00:28.228
Calvin, what about this?

00:28.294 --> 00:32.165
I love the story that hat
is telling on you.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.800
I saw the price
of that.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.735
Is the moral of the story
bankruptcy?

00:35.802 --> 00:37.704
(laughs)

00:37.771 --> 00:39.272
Oh, I like this guy.

00:39.339 --> 00:41.641
Would you two care
for some complimentary

00:41.708 --> 00:43.510
small-batch bourbon
while you shop?

00:43.576 --> 00:45.145
I like this guy.

00:45.211 --> 00:47.514
Complimentary
is my favorite brand.

00:50.583 --> 00:51.718
Thank you.

00:50.583 --> 00:51.718
Mm-hmm.

00:51.785 --> 00:55.288
(sniffs) Ooh, oaky, yet peppery.

00:55.355 --> 00:58.258
Am I sensing some notes
of burnt caramel?

00:58.324 --> 01:00.293
Dave, I would take you
more seriously

01:00.360 --> 01:01.661
if I didn't see you drinking

01:01.728 --> 01:03.430
a box of chocolate milk
this morning.

01:06.132 --> 01:08.368
You know what would
look amazing on you?

01:08.435 --> 01:10.470
This jacket.

01:10.537 --> 01:13.440
Ooh! That is
a nice jacket.

01:10.537 --> 01:13.440
Mm-hmm.

01:13.506 --> 01:15.475
Oh, you know what?
Calvin, you should try that on.

01:15.542 --> 01:18.378
Is it complimentary to try on?

01:18.445 --> 01:20.814
As long as you stay
in the store.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.115
(chuckles) Hey.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.652
Okay. Yeah.

01:25.718 --> 01:28.488
Yeah, that's nice right there.

01:25.718 --> 01:28.488
All right.

01:28.555 --> 01:31.724
Now that's how that jacket
was made to be worn.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.259
(chuckles)

01:33.326 --> 01:35.228
You know, it might be
the bourbon talking,

01:35.295 --> 01:37.130
but, uh, I believe you.

01:37.197 --> 01:38.198
(chuckles)

01:38.264 --> 01:40.433
Whew.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.303
Calvin, you know what?
You should get it.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.205
I mean, I do need
a jacket, right?

01:45.271 --> 01:46.406
Yeah.

01:46.473 --> 01:49.876
And it's on sale
for only $800.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.545
Man, this is L.A.
Don't nobody need a jacket.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.280
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:54.347 --> 01:55.782
Calvin, don't take it off.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.518
That jacket's so sharp,
you might cut yourself.

01:58.585 --> 02:01.721
Aw, yeah, man.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.523
I do look fly,
though, right?

02:01.788 --> 02:03.523
Yeah.

02:04.757 --> 02:06.392
I don't know, Dave,

02:06.459 --> 02:10.163
I just can't justify
spending $800 for a jacket.

02:10.230 --> 02:11.464
If it makes you
feel better,

02:11.531 --> 02:13.800
it's actually $799.99.

02:16.402 --> 02:19.339
So, you saying 700
and some change?

02:19.405 --> 02:20.840
Mm-hmm.

02:20.907 --> 02:22.775
Well, I can justify that.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.546
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:26.613 --> 02:27.847
♪ Welcome to the hood. ♪

02:33.953 --> 02:35.455
I mean, look,
I can wear this

02:35.522 --> 02:37.457
to so many different
special occasions.

02:37.524 --> 02:39.559
The Met Gala, all right.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.594
Pop it up like this, BET Awards.

02:41.661 --> 02:42.695
(laughs)

02:42.762 --> 02:43.930
And right here,

02:43.997 --> 02:46.733
double date with
Barack and Michelle.

02:46.799 --> 02:49.269
But, baby, you don't do
any of those things.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.404
Because I never had this jacket.

02:52.672 --> 02:56.175
Well, I think it's
very chic, very sexy.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.344
When a piece tells your story,

02:58.411 --> 02:59.879
you got to read it,

02:59.946 --> 03:01.548
even if it was a lot of money.

03:01.614 --> 03:03.650
Well, Calvin,
you know what they say,

03:03.716 --> 03:04.817
you can't take it
with you.

03:04.884 --> 03:06.619
Well, they lied.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.221
I'm getting buried
in this thing.

03:09.822 --> 03:11.190
Well, baby, I'm happy
you're finally

03:11.257 --> 03:13.326
splurging a little
on yourself.

03:11.257 --> 03:13.326
Yeah.

03:13.393 --> 03:14.661
(phone chiming)

03:14.727 --> 03:17.564
(gasps) Dave, Daisy Wasser
just texted me back.

03:17.630 --> 03:18.631
Oh, my God. Okay.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.301
All right. It's all happening.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.303
Okay, who's Daisy Wasser?

03:23.369 --> 03:24.671
My new mom friend.

03:24.737 --> 03:26.439
Her daughter Thatcher's
on Grover's soccer team.

03:26.506 --> 03:29.342
Yeah, and her husband, Josh,
is a celebrity chef.

03:26.506 --> 03:29.342
Mm-hmm.

03:29.409 --> 03:31.344
He owns a farm-to-table
restaurant.

03:31.411 --> 03:33.846
That sounds like food
with dirt on it.

03:33.913 --> 03:37.216
That's five-star dirt.

03:37.283 --> 03:38.952
More importantly...
(sighs)

03:39.018 --> 03:40.520
we really need
parent friends

03:40.587 --> 03:42.221
to do all these
parent activities with.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.757
Like go to animated movies,
kids' birthday parties,

03:44.824 --> 03:47.527
and water parks.
Unless you guys are interested?

03:47.594 --> 03:50.430
We didn't want to do those
things with our own damn kids.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.501
Well, look at us, we're
all making new friends.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.270
(chuckles)

03:55.568 --> 03:57.270
(stammers)

03:57.337 --> 03:59.305
Hello? Jay-Z?

03:59.372 --> 04:01.941
You're making
a new album?

04:02.008 --> 04:05.645
Of course. I would love to pose
on the cover in my new jacket.

04:12.318 --> 04:13.953
Oh, hey, man.
Where you coming from?

04:14.020 --> 04:17.423
Uh... You know,
I was out with the...

04:17.490 --> 04:18.625
(stammers, clears throat)
Nowhere.

04:18.691 --> 04:21.995
(stammers)

04:18.691 --> 04:21.995
Man, what you doing?

04:22.061 --> 04:23.630
You left your phone
in my car.

04:23.696 --> 04:25.264
(chuckles) Thanks.
I'll see you later, Trey.

04:25.331 --> 04:26.733
Hey, Marty, you would've
loved that new Marvel movie.

04:26.799 --> 04:28.001
I'm surprised
you didn't go with us.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.402
It was nerds
everywhere.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.372
Goodbye, Trey. (grunts)

04:32.438 --> 04:36.009
Get out. Get the hell out, Trey.

04:36.075 --> 04:37.977
Uh, I thought you said

04:38.044 --> 04:40.380
you didn't feel like
going to the Marvel movie.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.482
(sighs) Look, I'm sorry.

04:42.548 --> 04:44.050
I forgot you wanted
to see it, okay?

04:44.117 --> 04:46.419
Which is why I put it
in our shared calendar.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.321
(scoffs) Marty, you know
I never check that.

04:48.388 --> 04:51.524
Which is why I put a Post-it
on your pillow.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.593
Oh, come on, man.
It's just a movie.

04:53.660 --> 04:54.961
I...

04:55.028 --> 04:57.330
A superhero movie

04:57.397 --> 04:58.765
is not just a movie.

04:58.831 --> 05:01.534
It is an experience.

05:04.504 --> 05:06.506
Well, here's to
new parent friends

05:06.572 --> 05:08.441
that understand the importance
of day drinking.

05:08.508 --> 05:10.677
(chuckles)

05:10.743 --> 05:13.980
Okay, Josh, look, I-I don't want
to make this weird, but

05:14.047 --> 05:16.315
I followed your recipe
for homemade beer

05:16.382 --> 05:18.451
and would love to know
what you think.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.955
Wow. Wow!

05:23.022 --> 05:24.857
(smacks lips)
Is that clove?

05:24.924 --> 05:27.760
It is! Yeah, I was hoping
you were gonna pick up on that.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.397
Hey, you guys are great hosts.

05:31.464 --> 05:33.399
Why don't you let us
return the favor next time?

05:33.466 --> 05:35.535
Thatcher and Grover can swim

05:35.601 --> 05:36.903
while we hang at the bar

05:36.969 --> 05:38.071
in our pool.

05:38.137 --> 05:39.939
You haven't had
a margarita

05:40.006 --> 05:41.941
until you had
a swim-up margarita.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.509
Ooh.

05:43.576 --> 05:45.111
You know, I have been
waiting my whole life

05:45.178 --> 05:46.846
for someone to say
those words to me.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.881
(laughter)

05:48.948 --> 05:52.552
Submit, human!

05:48.948 --> 05:52.552
Whoa. Okay, okay.
All right, hey.

05:52.618 --> 05:55.521
Hey, guys. Guys. Hey, hey.
Is everybody okay?

05:55.588 --> 05:57.023
We're space pirates.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.092
Aw, I love that you guys
are using your imagination.

05:59.158 --> 06:00.593
You're so creative.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.428
And you're so basic.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.464
Stop talking to me
like I'm a child.

06:06.132 --> 06:09.502
Thatcher, thanks
for giving us your truth,

06:09.569 --> 06:11.471
but next time, let's
choose kinder words.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.773
Okay. Will do, Daisy.

06:13.840 --> 06:14.974
(chuckles)

06:17.677 --> 06:19.445
Thatcher calls you
by your first name?

06:19.512 --> 06:20.813
Yes, yes.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.849
We, uh, we listen
to a parenting podcast

06:22.915 --> 06:25.852
that suggests "mom and dad"
causes an imbalance

06:25.918 --> 06:28.521
in the power dynamic
between parent and child.

06:28.588 --> 06:30.056
Mm. Mm.

06:28.588 --> 06:30.056
GROVER: Stop.
You're hitting too hard.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.024
THATCHER: I don't care!

06:30.123 --> 06:32.024
Okay. Yeah, sure.

06:32.091 --> 06:34.026
I guess, uh, there's an argument

06:34.093 --> 06:36.129
for empowering kids.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.799
Oh!

06:39.866 --> 06:41.501
Sorry.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.970
No need to
apologize, kids.

06:44.036 --> 06:45.505
Things are
just things.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.540
Don't let it cause
any psychic trauma.

06:50.877 --> 06:54.147
Guys, thanks for understanding.
We will pay to replace it.

06:54.213 --> 06:55.948
(phone chimes)

06:56.015 --> 06:58.785
Oh, look at that.
You already Venmo'd me. Thanks.

07:00.052 --> 07:02.121
We found that allowing
Thatcher to discover

07:02.188 --> 07:04.423
her own boundaries
is really good

07:04.490 --> 07:06.459
for her social-emotional
portfolio.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.795
Hmm...

07:08.861 --> 07:10.530
Sometimes boundaries
are good, right?

07:10.596 --> 07:13.099
You know, like at a museum
or around my vase.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.638
Okay, baby,

07:18.704 --> 07:20.606
you ready to go to dinner?

07:18.704 --> 07:20.606
Oh, yeah.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.175
I've been
dreaming about

07:22.241 --> 07:23.943
Brachetto's
chicken parm all day.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.578
(chuckles) Well...

07:25.645 --> 07:26.846
We're going
to a nice restaurant.

07:26.913 --> 07:28.214
Aren't you gonna wear
your new jacket?

07:28.281 --> 07:31.584
(laughs) Brachetto's
is not jacket worthy.

07:31.651 --> 07:34.887
(chuckles) Any place
where you can use crayons

07:34.954 --> 07:37.890
to color on the table
is not that nice.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.458
You're being ridiculous.

07:39.525 --> 07:40.993
You spent all that money
on a new jacket,

07:41.060 --> 07:42.795
and now you're afraid
to wear it?

07:42.862 --> 07:45.731
I'm not afraid to wear it.
I just choose not to wear it

07:45.798 --> 07:49.202
out in that dirty world full
of miscreants and vagabonds.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.905
Okay. Okay,
you know what?

07:52.972 --> 07:56.542
We're gonna take this
nice and slow, okay?

07:56.609 --> 07:58.544
We're gonna put
the jacket on...

07:56.609 --> 07:58.544
All right.

07:58.611 --> 07:59.712
Come on, baby,
come on. You got--

07:59.779 --> 08:02.248
Oh, look at that.
Now...

08:02.315 --> 08:05.985
we're gonna wear
the jacket outside,

08:06.052 --> 08:08.888
and then if that goes well,
we'll wear it to the car.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.623
(chuckles)

08:08.955 --> 08:10.623
Good?

08:10.690 --> 08:12.258
No, I get it, I get it.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.258
You got it?

08:12.325 --> 08:15.728
It's nice, you know. Yeah.
I mean, why was I tripping?

08:15.795 --> 08:18.731
You tripping.

08:15.795 --> 08:18.731
(chuckling) Come on.

08:18.798 --> 08:21.601
Okay, here we go.
Thank you, baby.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.902
(thunder crashes)

08:22.969 --> 08:25.538
Aw, hell no.
It's raining out there.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.273
God has spoken. Mm-mm.

08:30.576 --> 08:32.278
ANNOUNCER (on TV):
And that does it for our
post-game coverage

08:32.345 --> 08:35.648
of the epic battle between
the Lakers and the Celtics.

08:35.715 --> 08:38.284
Man, I would've killed
to have been at that game.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.586
(laughing, cheering)

08:41.587 --> 08:43.022
Yeah!

08:43.089 --> 08:45.925
Oh, that was, hands down,
one of the most fun nights

08:45.992 --> 08:48.261
ever!

08:45.992 --> 08:48.261
Yeah, no joke.

08:48.327 --> 08:50.563
And I've been to Medieval Times.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.866
Hold up. W-Wait, wait.
You two were at the game?

08:53.933 --> 08:56.068
Bro, we were basically
in the game.

08:56.135 --> 08:59.038
Marty got us JPL floor seats.
Thank you, science!

08:59.105 --> 09:01.240
You, too, Marty.

09:01.307 --> 09:02.909
Wow, really?

09:02.975 --> 09:05.111
You know how much I wanted
to go to that game.

09:05.177 --> 09:09.015
Oh, and how would I know that?

09:09.081 --> 09:10.950
Did you put a Post-it
on my pillow?

09:11.017 --> 09:13.085
I know what you're
trying to do, Marty.

09:13.152 --> 09:16.155
Oh, do you now?
Because all I was doing

09:16.222 --> 09:18.557
was enjoying a night out
with my good friend, Trey.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.760
First of all, Trey

09:20.826 --> 09:22.261
is my good friend.

09:22.328 --> 09:24.664
I mean, yeah,
but you never got me

09:24.730 --> 09:26.299
floor seats
to the Laker game.

09:26.365 --> 09:30.002
Well, how about some tacos
from the truck on 3rd Street?

09:30.069 --> 09:31.971
Do I get guac?

09:30.069 --> 09:31.971
Yes.

09:32.038 --> 09:33.205
You get guac.

09:36.208 --> 09:39.011
I call dibs
on the last Popsicle.

09:43.716 --> 09:47.586
I mean, that swim-up bar
was awesome.

09:47.653 --> 09:50.623
You know, Josh did not have to
name a margarita after me,

09:50.690 --> 09:53.960
but those Dave-aritas
really hit the spot.

09:55.161 --> 09:56.595
What a perfect day.

09:56.662 --> 09:59.198
Perfect? Dave,
you're wearing my wrap

09:59.265 --> 10:00.633
because their
obnoxious kid

10:00.700 --> 10:01.834
threw your clothes
into the pool.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.936
Well, which allowed me

10:04.003 --> 10:07.640
to get a lovely breeze.

10:04.003 --> 10:07.640
(scoffs)

10:07.707 --> 10:09.875
Look, Josh and Daisy are great,

10:09.942 --> 10:12.044
but their daughter's
a nightmare.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.146
She called me "troll toes."

10:14.213 --> 10:18.017
Which is more of an observation
than it is a criticism.

10:19.852 --> 10:23.189
O-Okay, okay, look.

10:23.255 --> 10:24.924
Let's just give them
one more chance.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.993
We have so much in common.

10:27.059 --> 10:29.061
You know, Thatcher just...

10:29.128 --> 10:31.630
keeps us on our troll toes.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.668
Not funny, and besides,

10:35.735 --> 10:37.303
she's a bad influence on Grover.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.205
Grover is a great kid.

10:39.271 --> 10:40.906
Thatcher is not gonna turn him.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.174
GEMMA:
Oh, sweetie,

10:42.241 --> 10:43.709
it's getting late.

10:43.776 --> 10:44.977
Please take a quick shower
before bed.

10:45.044 --> 10:47.913
I'll get to it
when I get to it, Gemma.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.019
Upstairs, now.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.054
(groans) Fine.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.793
Uh... Gemma,

11:00.860 --> 11:02.228
I think we might want
to be mindful

11:02.294 --> 11:04.897
of his social-emotional
portfolio.

11:04.964 --> 11:07.833
Upstairs, now.

11:10.202 --> 11:11.303
Fine.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.813
Why are we hosting
the Wassers again?

11:20.880 --> 11:22.848
After yesterday,
I am not in the mood.

11:22.915 --> 11:24.350
I didn't have a choice.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.786
Josh just texted me,
"On our way," with a wine emoji.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.421
Well, let's just
turn off the lights

11:28.487 --> 11:29.789
and pretend we're not home.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.158
(knocking on door)

11:29.855 --> 11:32.158
Too late. Hey!

11:37.129 --> 11:38.697
Hi.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.697
Oh, hey, guys. Hey, Thatcher.

11:38.764 --> 11:40.166
Uh, Grover's just having a snack
in the kitchen.

11:40.232 --> 11:42.134
And before you ask, no,
we don't have any candy.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.903
I already know
that your snacks suck.

11:43.969 --> 11:46.172
Good thing I had chocolate
in the car.

11:52.078 --> 11:53.879
Don't worry about that blanket,

11:53.946 --> 11:56.749
just an irreplaceable
family heirloom.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.451
Sorry about that,

11:58.517 --> 12:00.386
and about yesterday.

11:58.517 --> 12:00.386
Yeah.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.455
We, uh, we brought you
this biodynamic

12:02.521 --> 12:04.824
sparkling Lambrusco
to apologize.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.226
Oh, well, that makes it
all better.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.028
I'll go get some glasses.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.063
(glass shatters)

12:11.130 --> 12:13.499
Make that plastic cups.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.499
(knocking on door)

12:13.566 --> 12:15.401
Ooh, excuse me. Sorry.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.170
Oh, hey, come on in, guys.

12:18.237 --> 12:21.507
Hey, we're just taking
Calvin's new jacket

12:21.574 --> 12:23.242
out for a test-drive.

12:24.443 --> 12:25.978
See? That wasn't so bad.

12:26.045 --> 12:27.880
Not so bad?

12:27.947 --> 12:29.515
Those pigeons on the
power line were trying

12:29.582 --> 12:32.084
to go all Call of Duty
on me.

12:32.151 --> 12:33.285
No pun intended.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.355
DAVE:
Uh, Josh, Daisy,

12:36.422 --> 12:38.324
these are our dearest friends,
Calvin and Tina Butler.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.959
Hey, so nice
to meet you.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.362
(mechanical blipping)

12:48.901 --> 12:50.936
(alarm blaring)

12:52.471 --> 12:54.507
Josh Wasser. How you doing?

12:54.573 --> 12:55.808
Calvin Butler.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.443
Oh! (chuckles)

12:57.510 --> 13:00.212
No reason to do all that.
You know what I mean? My man.

13:03.082 --> 13:04.283
Hey!

13:04.350 --> 13:06.152
I'm so glad you guys are here.

13:06.218 --> 13:09.088
(screaming)

13:06.218 --> 13:09.088
Whoa, careful, careful!

13:09.155 --> 13:10.222
Okay, all right.

13:09.155 --> 13:10.222
Oh, God.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.192
What the hell?

13:13.259 --> 13:14.927
It's fruit punch.

13:14.994 --> 13:18.330
Say hello to my little friend.

13:19.865 --> 13:21.934
Thatcher,

13:22.001 --> 13:23.969
are we making
good decisions right now?

13:25.304 --> 13:27.339
(alarm blaring)

13:27.406 --> 13:29.408
Okay, that's it.
I'm out of here.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.143
There's a little white girl
out of control.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.279
I'm gonna take my chances
with the pigeons.

13:33.345 --> 13:35.381
(dramatic music playing)

13:45.324 --> 13:47.960
(distorted):
I got you!

13:50.162 --> 13:51.163
(thuds)

13:51.230 --> 13:52.865
Yes.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.004
Ooh.

13:59.071 --> 14:01.073
(grunting)

14:01.140 --> 14:04.009
Hey, thank you
for doing that for me.

14:04.076 --> 14:05.544
I did it
for the jacket.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.882
Now, where is she?

14:09.949 --> 14:12.351
'Cause I ain't afraid
to fight no fifth grader.

14:12.418 --> 14:13.953
Uh...

14:14.019 --> 14:16.422
That is just not the way
we deal with our daughter.

14:16.488 --> 14:19.391
See, stains will come out,
but psychic trauma,

14:19.458 --> 14:21.293
that lasts forever.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.029
Right.

14:24.096 --> 14:25.364
That little girl

14:25.431 --> 14:28.133
needs some good old-fashioned
Black parenting.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.470
Say the word and me and Tina'll
sneak through the back door.

14:33.405 --> 14:36.041
All I need
is five minutes.

14:40.145 --> 14:42.014
Oh,

14:42.081 --> 14:44.516
so you up in here
making a sandwich?

14:44.583 --> 14:46.285
Looks like it.

14:48.487 --> 14:51.056
Well, so am I.

14:54.593 --> 14:56.495
(clears throat)
Pass me the mayo.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.600
(squishing)

15:03.969 --> 15:05.471
We all out.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.509
So, it's gonna
be like that, huh?

15:10.576 --> 15:13.512
(chuckles) Oh, yeah.
It's like that.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.381
(gags)

15:15.447 --> 15:18.017
Ah! Ah!

15:18.083 --> 15:20.919
I ruined my own sandwich
out of spite.

15:20.986 --> 15:23.055
Look, Marty,
this is stupid, man.

15:23.122 --> 15:24.523
What are we fighting for?

15:24.590 --> 15:28.093
Because you clearly don't like
spending time with me.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.631
I do like spending time
with you.

15:32.698 --> 15:35.501
I just don't like spending
all my time with you.

15:35.567 --> 15:38.137
You know, we're brothers,
we're roommates,

15:38.203 --> 15:39.538
we ride
to work together.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.507
That's a lot.

15:41.573 --> 15:43.542
Well, why didn't you just say
you needed space?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.444
Know what, you right.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.946
I should have,
and I'm sorry.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.016
I'm sorry, too.

15:51.083 --> 15:52.685
All right.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.689
Dave, this isn't
gonna work.

15:56.755 --> 16:00.392
I want parent friends, too,
but not these parent friends.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.395
Let's just tell them,
"Josh, Daisy.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.097
"You're terrible parents,

16:05.164 --> 16:07.266
and your daughter is gonna
grow up to become the Joker."

16:08.667 --> 16:10.302
Knock, knock.

16:11.603 --> 16:13.205
Guys, while you
were in here,

16:13.272 --> 16:16.175
we were out there
doing a tandem meditation.

16:16.241 --> 16:18.077
(groans)

16:18.143 --> 16:20.512
And, um, we were both
picking up

16:20.579 --> 16:23.315
on some pretty
negative harmonics.

16:23.382 --> 16:26.151
Yeah, well,
we were in here

16:26.218 --> 16:29.088
picking up after your daughter's
trail of destruction.

16:30.723 --> 16:34.259
Okay, okay, uh, well, clearly,
we're struggling here.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.994
Uh, we just

16:36.061 --> 16:37.996
have very different
parenting styles.

16:36.061 --> 16:37.996
(sighs)

16:38.063 --> 16:41.033
Yes, we're picking up
on that, too,

16:41.100 --> 16:44.169
and we're happy to share
some parenting tips with you.

16:45.771 --> 16:47.272
Wait, what?

16:47.339 --> 16:48.640
DAVE:
Uh, you know what?

16:48.707 --> 16:51.143
Guys... (chuckles)
Call us old-fashioned,

16:51.210 --> 16:54.046
but we are firm believers
in, I d--

16:54.113 --> 16:56.715
the traditional
parent-child dynamic.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.484
Oh...

16:58.550 --> 17:01.453
That is so adorably
Judeo-Christian of you.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.056
Okay, um...

17:04.123 --> 17:05.457
You know,
before things get personal,

17:05.524 --> 17:07.226
why don't we,
why don't we just be adults,

17:07.292 --> 17:09.194
put a pin in the parenting
conversation, and go enjoy

17:09.261 --> 17:11.663
the very nice bottle of wine
that you guys brought over.

17:13.232 --> 17:16.301
All right.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.636
See that?

17:17.703 --> 17:19.471
It was good that you
married a mediator.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.806
Your mother
was wrong.

17:24.309 --> 17:26.412
(gasps)

17:24.309 --> 17:26.412
Oh, my. You have
got to be kidding me.

17:26.478 --> 17:27.579
No!

17:26.478 --> 17:27.579
(paint spraying)

17:27.646 --> 17:28.714
No. No way.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.749
That's your face
right now, Gemma.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.718
Venmo's on its way.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.620
Thatcher,

17:34.686 --> 17:37.055
I know we practice
our street art at home,

17:37.122 --> 17:39.224
but Dave and Gemma
might not like it.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.692
We don't. Get out.

17:40.759 --> 17:42.694
Hey, uh,

17:42.761 --> 17:44.696
Josh, Daisy,
this is over.

17:44.763 --> 17:46.298
Well, that breaks
our hearts.

17:46.365 --> 17:49.067
Well, Thatcher broke
our house. Bye.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.603
But I want to sign my work.

17:51.670 --> 17:53.105
Okay, you know what?

17:53.172 --> 17:54.606
How about this?
"Xoxo, you little brat."

17:54.673 --> 17:56.241
Now, get out of here.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.412
Thank God

18:00.479 --> 18:02.247
I'm not her dad.

18:03.682 --> 18:06.452
Man, that girl was a lot.

18:06.518 --> 18:07.820
You did the right thing, Dave.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.858
Oh.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.460
I know.

18:14.526 --> 18:17.129
My room. No iPad.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.099
CALVIN:
I've made my final decision.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.469
This jacket
is driving me crazy,

18:23.535 --> 18:24.770
so I'm taking it back.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.772
Calvin, you're overreacting.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.640
Am I?

18:28.707 --> 18:31.176
I mean, you had to go
all Secret Service

18:31.243 --> 18:34.213
just to protect me from
little baby Scarface over there.

18:35.781 --> 18:39.117
Clearly, I shouldn't have
such an expensive jacket.

18:39.184 --> 18:41.386
You know who you
remind me of right now?

18:41.453 --> 18:43.589
My mother.

18:43.655 --> 18:45.657
Okay, now you're
just being mean.

18:47.493 --> 18:50.496
She saved up for years
to buy this china set,

18:50.562 --> 18:53.732
and when she finally got it,
she was so afraid it would break

18:53.799 --> 18:56.134
she never took it
out of the box.

18:56.201 --> 18:57.703
And you know
how this story ends.

18:57.769 --> 19:00.239
Yes. The china was safe

19:00.305 --> 19:02.508
and preserved
for future generations.

19:03.942 --> 19:06.311
Yes, Calvin,
but she also died

19:06.378 --> 19:08.480
before she got a chance
to ever use it.

19:08.547 --> 19:10.148
Mm.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.850
Yeah, that's a shame.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.520
Your mother deserved
to enjoy nice things.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.822
And so do you.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.690
(chuckles)

19:18.757 --> 19:21.159
You know what? You're right.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.395
Give me that jacket.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.395
Okay.

19:23.462 --> 19:26.932
You know, this neighborhood
deserves nice things, too,

19:26.999 --> 19:29.401
like seeing me in this jacket.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.805
I mean, I do
look good, don't I?

19:33.872 --> 19:34.806
(whoops)

19:34.873 --> 19:36.475
Well, come on.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.277
Let's go give them
something to talk about.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.579
Ooh, are we going
someplace special?

19:40.646 --> 19:42.247
Yes.

19:42.314 --> 19:44.650
I'm taking my favorite girl
out for ice cream.

19:44.716 --> 19:47.252
Ooh, yes.

19:44.716 --> 19:47.252
I-In a cup, not a cone.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.787
Okay.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.787
B-Baby steps.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.562
I mean, my man.

19:56.628 --> 19:59.865
First, you splurge
on a new jacket,

19:59.932 --> 20:03.335
then you get two scoops
of ice cream with sprinkles.

20:03.402 --> 20:05.270
(chuckles)

20:05.337 --> 20:06.772
YOLO, Tina.

20:06.838 --> 20:09.675
You know? I got to say,

20:09.741 --> 20:11.476
it feels kind of good

20:11.543 --> 20:14.680
splurging on things
you don't necessarily need.

20:14.746 --> 20:17.249
I might have a little Diddy
in me after all.

20:17.316 --> 20:18.650
You know.

20:17.316 --> 20:18.650
Uh-oh. Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.218
Get it, get it, baby.
Get it.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.753
(knocking on door)

20:20.285 --> 20:21.753
Take that, take that.

20:21.820 --> 20:25.624
(chuckles)

20:25.691 --> 20:28.226
We have a surprise
for you, Calvin.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.402
I went and got the same jacket.

20:37.469 --> 20:39.504
Jacket twins.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.841
Wow.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.841
Okay, I see you walking.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.409
That's right.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.409
CALVIN: Walk it out, baby.

20:44.476 --> 20:45.844
Okay. Walk it.

20:44.476 --> 20:45.844
Get it, Dave.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.846
And two and three,
and walk it out.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.846
All right.

20:47.913 --> 20:51.016
Walk it out. Walk it out.
