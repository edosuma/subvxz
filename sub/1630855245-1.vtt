00:30.800 --> 00:36.360
BASED ON A TRUE STORY

01:34.920 --> 01:38.760
Maestro, what an honor!
Hey, kid, make the maestro a coffee!

01:38.840 --> 01:39.960
Give me that bag.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.400
Maestro, if you need
playing cards, cigarettes--

01:42.480 --> 01:46.520
Sir, my nephew's incredible, a genius.
Maybe you could listen to him--

01:47.920 --> 01:51.480
-I was telling him something important!
-There's plenty of time!

01:51.560 --> 01:54.960
Maestro! Take a seat.
Come over here. Have a seat.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.760
The room is at your disposal.
This is your bed.

01:57.840 --> 02:01.200
The top one is comfortable and airy,
but you'll need to climb.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.160
Plus, look up there.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.160
There's mold and rubble
that might fall on your head.

02:06.240 --> 02:09.720
This is the least uncomfortable,
but it's the most cramped.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.680
You decide. Taste is taste.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.560
Which do you prefer?

02:30.520 --> 02:31.760
Wake up, kid!

02:32.720 --> 02:34.080
Come on, wake up!

02:34.960 --> 02:37.520
Tell me, are you who they told me you are?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.120
Well, I mean--

02:39.200 --> 02:41.160
Kid, are you Enrico by Erry or not?

02:41.240 --> 02:42.560
-Yes.
-All right.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.440
Listen carefully.

02:44.520 --> 02:47.560
Your brother Angelo's friends
told me to give you a message.

02:47.640 --> 02:50.960
The money is safe.
It's buried at a construction site.

02:51.040 --> 02:54.600
Tomorrow they'll pour concrete on it
and build tennis courts.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.720
The concession expires in ten years.

02:56.800 --> 03:01.160
With a small bid, you'll get the courts
with all the money underneath.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.080
And you'll be rich again.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.880
-Kid, do you understand me or not?
-Yes.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.440
In ten years, we'll be rich again.

03:09.520 --> 03:13.160
Just out of curiosity,
I've been in jail for 20 years.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.640
I may not know what's going on outside.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.760
But to have that much money,

03:18.480 --> 03:20.160
who the fuck are you?

03:23.120 --> 03:23.960
Yeah.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.400
Hello?

03:38.240 --> 03:40.040
Hey, Pasquale, what's up?

03:40.120 --> 03:44.240
Okay. Yes, I'll tell her right away. Bye.

03:50.680 --> 03:51.960
Marisa!

03:54.840 --> 03:56.880
Marisa!

03:58.080 --> 04:00.040
Hi, Marisa. Your husband called.

04:00.120 --> 04:03.280
He said he's on his way
and to get the tea ready.

04:03.360 --> 04:04.520
Thanks, Carmela.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.440
Bye.

04:06.040 --> 04:09.760
When uphill, shift into gear.
You won't get tired with lighter pedals.

04:09.840 --> 04:10.960
Let me take a ride.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.840
No. It's expensive.
You'll end up falling and breaking it.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.040
-Just one.
-No can do.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.600
How do the pedals get lighter?

04:16.680 --> 04:18.800
As I said, if you put it into gear,
they run lighter.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.920
Peppe!

04:21.480 --> 04:24.720
Angelo! Your father called.
You have to make the tea.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.120
What a drag.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.160
I know it's the gears,
but how does the mechanism work?

04:29.240 --> 04:30.520
Mom, five more minutes!

04:30.600 --> 04:33.320
Don't make me come down there!
Where's Enrico?

04:33.400 --> 04:35.640
I don't know.
I guess at the shop, as usual.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.880
Go get him! Go on! Move!

04:37.960 --> 04:40.200
Again, if you put it into gear,
it's lighter.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.440
I get it. If you put it into gear…

04:42.520 --> 04:44.320
Never mind. You don't know.

04:44.400 --> 04:48.160
-Let's go get Enrico at the shop.
-Why is your brother always in there?

04:48.240 --> 04:50.440
-Is he a bit retarded?
-What did you just say?

04:50.520 --> 04:52.800
Do you know who you're talking to?

04:52.880 --> 04:54.920
-I don't give a shit.
-Angelo! Stop it!

04:55.000 --> 04:57.120
Angelo! Let's go! What are you doing?

04:57.200 --> 04:59.160
Get lost! You're still here?

04:59.240 --> 05:01.640
Come on, Angelo.
Just ignore him. Let's go!

05:01.720 --> 05:05.520
<i>You're still tuned in</i>
<i>to Radio Kiss Kiss 108,8.</i>

05:05.600 --> 05:10.480
<i>Today I am delighted to play</i>
<i>an amazing band not very famous in Italy.</i>

05:10.560 --> 05:13.480
<i>-Do you know them?</i>
-The Jackson 5, "I Want You Back."

05:13.560 --> 05:15.560
<i>-It's the Jackson 5…</i>
<i>-</i>Erry.

05:15.640 --> 05:16.880
…<i>with "I Want You Back."</i>

05:16.960 --> 05:20.280
Unbelievable! He knows them all.
How the fuck does he do it?

05:20.360 --> 05:23.280
I don't know, Don Ferdinando.
He does it at home too.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.080
Erry, come on. We need to go.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.480
-Bye, Don Ferdinando.
-Have a good day.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.600
Bye, kids.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.880
Hey, there! I'm home!

07:00.320 --> 07:02.520
-Hello, Pasquale.
-Good morning, Marì.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.280
Dad! We made the tea!

07:04.360 --> 07:06.560
I made the darker one, like last time.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.120
Well done! Let's go see.

07:10.440 --> 07:13.280
What time did you wake up this morning?
I didn't hear you.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.720
-At half past four.
-Oh my! Why so early?

07:15.800 --> 07:18.960
Because I want to be in Piazza Garibaldi
for the half past noon train from Milan.

07:19.040 --> 07:19.880
The good one.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.960
This morning, Don Salvatore,
the delicatessen owner…

07:23.040 --> 07:23.880
Yeah?

07:23.960 --> 07:26.600
…he told everybody
he's been putting stuff on our tab,

07:26.680 --> 07:27.800
and we still have to pay.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.640
It was really embarrassing.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.840
Just tell him we will pay.
Look, I have 50 empty bottles.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.560
We'll fill them, sell them,
and we'll pay Don Salvatore.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.600
He's such a pain in the ass!
Kids, show me the tea!

07:40.520 --> 07:43.840
This is no good. It's too dark.
You need to add water.

07:43.920 --> 07:45.680
-This one's perfect. Who made it?
-I did.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.160
-No, Dad. I did.
-No, I did.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.560
Don't fight. You both did well.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.800
Let's bottle that one for now.
I'm in a hurry.

07:51.880 --> 07:55.280
-Dad, can we come to work with you?
-We'll help you like last time.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.680
Come on, Dad!

07:56.760 --> 07:59.320
Come on! Mom? Just say yes, please!

07:59.400 --> 08:00.240
All right.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.880
-Come on, then!
-Yes! Let's go!

08:01.960 --> 08:04.880
Kids, help me bottle.
Quick, the train leaves soon.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.160
-Dad?
-Yes?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.320
Are we poor?

08:17.560 --> 08:19.040
Peppe, what do you mean?

08:19.120 --> 08:22.000
What kind of question is that?
What do you mean "poor"?

08:22.080 --> 08:24.240
Aniello's father got him
this amazing thing.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.280
-Yeah?
-A bike with a gearbox.

08:26.360 --> 08:29.280
Really? They've invented
a bike with gears?

08:29.360 --> 08:31.760
Aniello got himself a bike with gears?

08:31.840 --> 08:32.680
Yes, Dad.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.280
When uphill, you put it in first gear,
and it's lighter.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.760
It is lighter uphill?
How is that even possible?

08:37.840 --> 08:39.760
It's got gears.
You shift into first gear--

08:39.840 --> 08:41.840
I won't ask for it on my birthday.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.720
We can't afford it anyway
because we're poor, right?

08:44.800 --> 08:46.320
What are you talking about?

08:46.400 --> 08:48.800
First, we are not poor.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.560
There's food on our table
every day, am I right?

08:51.640 --> 08:52.680
Yes.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.400
Plus, just so we are clear,

08:54.480 --> 08:57.520
how do you think Aniello's father
earns his money? Do you know?

08:57.600 --> 08:59.600
-He works for Don Michele.
-Yes.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.480
And what does he do for Don Michele?

09:01.560 --> 09:03.000
Kids, please.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.960
Never forget this.

09:05.040 --> 09:09.360
Besides the food, there's one thing
that must never be missing in our house.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.600
That is honesty.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.400
Officer, perhaps I'm not being clear.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.640
At the shop, you'll pay
the same price for one bottle

09:18.720 --> 09:20.040
as you pay me for a whole box.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.400
And why is it so cheap?

09:21.480 --> 09:25.640
Let's just say that these goods
were meant for the American market.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.560
Just yesterday, they fell off the truck.

09:27.640 --> 09:31.200
It's very high-quality stuff
that just came out of the distillery.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.000
By the way, enough with the chatter.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.840
Here, have a taste.
So you can test it yourself.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.960
You know, it's always better to taste.
Let me know.

09:42.520 --> 09:45.080
-It's good.
-You didn't believe me. Top quality!

09:45.160 --> 09:47.760
Just for you,
the whole box for 10,000 lire.

09:47.840 --> 09:50.080
-Fine. I'll take the box.
-Excuse me, sir.

09:50.160 --> 09:54.000
Would you give me 200 lire to call my dad
who is in the hospital in Battipaglia?

09:54.080 --> 09:57.720
Leave the gentleman alone!
200 lire for what?

09:57.800 --> 09:59.960
Go take a walk by the sea. Come on!

10:00.880 --> 10:04.800
I am so sorry, Officer.
These kids won't give me a break.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.400
Give me 10,000 lire, please.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.800
They keep coming and going. Unbelievable.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.640
-It's a pleasure doing business with you.
-Bye.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.320
Have a good day.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.720
-Hello, Don Pasquale.
-Hi, Don Mimì.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.240
Wow! Who are these kids? Your children?

10:22.320 --> 10:25.080
-Yes. At times I bring them here with me.
-I see.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.760
-Kids, say hello to Don Mimì!
-Hello, Don Mimì.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.040
They're so cute. What are their names?

10:30.120 --> 10:33.600
The eldest one is Peppe.
He's the genius of the family.

10:33.680 --> 10:34.800
Tell him what you've done.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.920
-I completed the fifth grade.
-Really?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.800
So next year you're going to sixth grade?

10:39.880 --> 10:41.720
Well, he doesn't have
to become a scientist.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.600
He got the diploma. Let's move on.

10:43.680 --> 10:47.200
This is Angelo, the youngest.
He's really headstrong.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.160
-He's headstrong…
-I am indeed.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.200
Then there's Enrico, the middle son.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.320
Erry, what do you like to do?

10:59.720 --> 11:01.240
-Name?
-Revolver DJ.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.480
Have we met before?

11:02.560 --> 11:03.440
Maybe.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.520
I usually play at Veleno, in Vomero.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.760
No, we have met somewhere else.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.040
Maybe this summer.
I played at the Lanternone in Palinuro.

11:12.120 --> 11:15.600
-It's you, then! That was a wild night!
-Thank you.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.760
You'll play mid-evening when it gets busy.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.840
Go have a drink. It's on me.

11:27.640 --> 11:28.480
Name?

11:29.760 --> 11:30.600
Frattasio Enrico.

11:31.640 --> 11:34.400
What is it, the army?
Don't you have a DJ name?

11:35.760 --> 11:37.800
A name… I was confused.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.720
So, my DJ name is

11:42.360 --> 11:45.160
DJ Enrico.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.520
And we've never met before?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.640
No, I don't think so.
I'm from Forcella. I don't…

11:53.240 --> 11:57.000
Erry, I'll be honest.
Tonight is a bit intense.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.880
I need to figure out
where I can slot you in

11:58.960 --> 12:00.400
and how things are going to run.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.160
Hey, Scorpio! It's about time!

12:03.240 --> 12:06.240
I even called the hotel!
They told me they couldn't find you.

12:19.840 --> 12:24.000
A big round of applause for DJ Pegaso!

12:26.600 --> 12:30.880
And now it is time for someone
many of you already know.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.480
From Palinuro, our next contestant…

12:33.560 --> 12:37.000
Revolver DJ!

12:41.560 --> 12:42.680
Go get 'em.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.480
Scorpio! Still knocking back
the melon vodka?

12:46.560 --> 12:48.360
You'll get drunk and play like shit.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.360
Sorry to disturb you.

12:50.440 --> 12:53.440
I need to know when my turn will be
so I can get ready.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.880
What's your name again?

12:56.480 --> 12:58.680
-DJ Enrico.
-Right, Enrico. Come here.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.320
Enrico, I can't let you play tonight

13:03.400 --> 13:05.120
because we've run on too long.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.520
Unfortunately, I absolutely
have to close the club at 2:00 a.m.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.760
Otherwise, the cops will storm in.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.320
I see.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.960
So, you mean I'm not performing?

13:17.040 --> 13:19.520
It's that I've been here
since 5:00 p.m., but…

13:19.600 --> 13:20.440
Sure.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.760
-Erry, do you have a job?
-Yes, of course.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.360
I work in a record store.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.600
Are you a music consultant?

13:28.920 --> 13:32.680
Not really. It's just a store
I've been going to since I was a kid.

13:32.760 --> 13:36.840
Since I was always around,
the owner hired me to do the cleaning.

13:36.920 --> 13:42.760
But in my spare time, I make mix tapes
that are quite popular in my neighborhood.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.040
Yeah.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.040
Enrico, I'll be honest with you.

13:47.880 --> 13:48.760
Yes.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.600
Being a DJ is a peculiar kind of job.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.760
It needs

13:53.720 --> 13:58.200
good looks, style, and internationality.

13:58.280 --> 14:01.000
Those are all things
that I just don't see in you.

14:01.080 --> 14:05.160
Not to mention the name you chose sucks.
You just added D and J to your name.

14:05.240 --> 14:08.280
Actually, I was really up for changing it.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.720
Erry, listen to me.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.480
Hold on to your job at the store.
Don't ditch it.

14:20.640 --> 14:23.560
We've got this one here, a little smaller.
It's amazing.

14:23.640 --> 14:27.240
It's got the cassette deck,
the radio, AM and FM.

14:27.320 --> 14:30.560
Of course it's a bit more expensive,
but the kid only turns 18 once.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.800
How much is it?

14:31.880 --> 14:33.200
Let's call it 30,000 lire.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.800
I'll add a nice music compilation
for kids.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.960
Sting, Vasco Rossi,
Pino Daniele, Baglioni.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.480
I'll have Enrico make it.

14:39.560 --> 14:42.560
He may be holding a broom,
but he's a musical genius.

14:42.640 --> 14:45.480
Fine, let's buy this nice gift
for the kid.

14:45.560 --> 14:49.040
Come by this afternoon to take the stereo
all wrapped with the tape inside.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.800
-Take care.
-Take care.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.480
Erry, I'm going home to eat.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.920
-Can I get you anything?
-No, thanks. I'm going too.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.840
I'll finish one more tape and then go.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.080
Fine. I'll see you here at half past four.

15:24.840 --> 15:29.080
SONGS FOR FRANCESCA
CHOSEN BY DJ ENRICO

15:58.600 --> 16:00.960
SONGS FOR FRANCESCA
MIXED BY ERRY

16:02.640 --> 16:05.360
-Erry, come and eat!
-Coming, Mom!

16:05.440 --> 16:06.760
Enrico!

16:07.680 --> 16:09.400
Erry! Where were you?

16:09.480 --> 16:11.040
-Did you make the tape?
-Yes.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.520
-Did you write "To Francesca"?
-Yes.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.480
-Did you put in Peppino di Capri?
-Yes.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.680
Did you put "Cuore Matto"?

16:15.760 --> 16:18.440
No, Peppino.
I just couldn't get myself to put it in.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.480
-You didn't?
-No.

16:19.560 --> 16:23.160
What's wrong with you? "Cuore Matto"
is Francesca's favorite song. I told you.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.720
She doesn't want to see me anymore.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.000
To win her back,
I needed the bit that says,

16:27.080 --> 16:29.200
"A crazy heart that looks only for you…"

16:29.280 --> 16:31.040
If you don't like it, I'll keep it.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.960
Fine! Put it in my pocket.
If she dumps me, it'll be your fault!

16:34.040 --> 16:35.840
Sure, Peppì, take it out on me!

16:35.920 --> 16:37.560
Now leave! I can't even get my hair right!

16:38.160 --> 16:39.040
Look at this hair!

16:39.120 --> 16:42.360
-Erry, hurry! Your food is getting cold!
-I'm coming!

16:42.440 --> 16:45.640
-Did you see what's going on downstairs?
-No, Angelo, tell me.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.360
It's full of cops, helicopters,
and people on the streets.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.880
-They're arresting the king. Let's go see.
-What? I'm starving!

16:51.960 --> 16:54.080
You can eat later!
Mom, Enrico's not hungry.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.840
-What?
-He said the food is not good.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.560
-What?
-Peppì, you coming?

16:57.640 --> 17:00.360
What do I care? Look at my hair!

17:00.440 --> 17:02.760
I knew showering
would be a terrible mistake.

17:05.080 --> 17:06.120
What's going on?

17:11.480 --> 17:13.480
Can you tell me what's going on?

17:30.440 --> 17:31.320
<i>Hello?</i>

17:32.280 --> 17:34.440
<i>Hello? Who is it?</i>

17:36.640 --> 17:38.360
-Hey!
-Come down for a second.

17:38.440 --> 17:41.440
-Are you mad? What if my father sees us?
-He won't. Come down!

17:41.520 --> 17:43.080
I have something for you.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.640
I told you we'd better not
see each other anymore.

17:45.720 --> 17:48.880
Okay, but now come down for a sec.
I need to give you something.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.040
Wait there.

18:01.760 --> 18:02.840
What do you want?

18:05.400 --> 18:07.680
To make up for the times I piss you off.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.200
Peppe!

18:13.440 --> 18:16.360
Hey. Can I call you later
to find out if you liked it?

18:34.800 --> 18:36.920
Hey, look where you're going, idiot!

18:37.000 --> 18:38.520
-Sorry.
-"Sorry" my ass.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.080
-Idiot!
-Alfò, do you know who this is?

18:41.160 --> 18:43.400
The idiot who does the cleaning
at the record store.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.280
-Yes, it's him.
-I don't just do the cleaning. I'm a DJ.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.120
Really? Are you a DJ?

18:48.200 --> 18:49.400
Are you kidding me?

18:50.160 --> 18:52.320
Piss off, you piece of shit!

18:52.920 --> 18:55.440
-Francesca! Who was it?
-No one, Mom.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.520
<i>This compilation is for Francesca.</i>

19:21.160 --> 19:22.960
<i>From her beloved Peppe.</i>

19:24.960 --> 19:27.160
<i>Greetings from DJ Erry.</i>

19:57.440 --> 19:58.760
Excuse me?

19:58.840 --> 20:00.160
Who the fuck are you?

21:23.240 --> 21:24.800
Brothers and sisters.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.200
We are gathered here
in the House of the Lord

21:27.280 --> 21:31.720
to wed our beloved children,
Giuseppe and Francesca.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.160
Let us pray.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.400
Hey! Erry.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.240
The traffic was crazy.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.920
Angelo's here.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.840
-Did I miss something?
-No, you didn't. It just started.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.040
-How are you?
-Terrible.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.000
-Why? What happened?
-Something unbelievable.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.400
Eduardo De Filippo came to our prison.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.280
-De Filippo came to the Filangieri?
-Yeah.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.000
He wants to set up a show
with the kids from the juvie.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.040
He auditioned me.

22:03.120 --> 22:06.640
He said, "Frattasio, you're a genius!
We'll do great things together."

22:08.000 --> 22:10.640
You mean you're going to do a show
with Eduardo De Filippo?

22:10.720 --> 22:11.600
No!

22:13.960 --> 22:15.880
No. That's why I feel terrible.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.720
You know what he asked me
on the first day of rehearsals?

22:18.800 --> 22:20.400
"Frattasio, when do you get out?"

22:20.480 --> 22:23.800
I told him, "I turn 18 in six months,
then I'll be out by law."

22:23.880 --> 22:25.160
-Sure.
-Guess what he said.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.440
"Huh!"

22:26.520 --> 22:30.080
"What do I do if you get out?
I lose my lead actor?"

22:30.160 --> 22:33.840
I said, "Maestro, I'm sorry
I only committed an <i>attempted murder</i>."

22:33.920 --> 22:36.720
"Next time I'll kill the guy
so I can do the show with you."

22:36.800 --> 22:37.720
Sure.

22:39.960 --> 22:40.920
How are you?

22:41.800 --> 22:43.800
Not bad.
I still do the cleaning at the store

22:43.880 --> 22:46.000
and mix tapes for our neighborhood.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.720
I heard it's going well.
You sell a lot of compilations.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.240
Word kind of got out,
and it brings in extra money.

22:51.320 --> 22:52.680
-Better than nothing.
-Yes--

22:53.520 --> 22:55.000
The word of the Lord.

22:55.080 --> 22:57.600
SCALES, APPLIANCES

22:57.680 --> 22:59.680
BEDS, SOFAS, MATTRESSES

22:59.760 --> 23:01.760
BESPOKE BEDROOMS

23:01.840 --> 23:03.840
BEDS, SOFAS

23:11.720 --> 23:14.400
-Hey, now watch your step.
-Load this next.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.600
There's no way.

23:17.400 --> 23:21.560
No, never mind. Take out these big ones.
We'll do this one later.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.320
Doesn't it feel weird?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.320
-What's going on?
-Guess what.

23:32.400 --> 23:36.000
They made me an offer for the store,
so I decided to retire early.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.480
I didn't tell you because of superstition.

23:40.560 --> 23:41.880
What do I do now?

23:41.960 --> 23:44.160
Erry, many people
have passed through here.

23:44.240 --> 23:47.600
You are the only talented one.
You'll never struggle.

23:48.280 --> 23:49.760
I don't know, Don Ferdinà.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.640
All I know, it was convenient for me
to do the cleaning here.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.680
Well, you can take all these records…

23:55.760 --> 23:58.640
They will be your severance.
And follow your passion.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.480
I don't know, Don Ferdinà.

24:01.560 --> 24:05.040
I would like to be a DJ,
but I don't know if I'm suited to it.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.080
I'm not like the others.

24:07.160 --> 24:09.520
I don't have style, internationality…

24:09.600 --> 24:13.760
Style? Internationality? Who told you
you have to do things like in the North?

24:14.360 --> 24:15.360
Now listen to me.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.520
Start your own business and move on.

24:20.880 --> 24:24.480
Erry, you know what?
DJs can even be born in Forcella.

24:36.680 --> 24:38.960
Guys, let's not make trouble.

24:39.040 --> 24:42.400
Everyone takes the cartons
due to them, understand?

24:42.480 --> 24:44.520
I don't want any trouble, guys.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.600
-Mohammed, stop pushing!
-Okay?

24:46.680 --> 24:49.640
Don't stand so close to me.
Respect the order of arrival.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.640
There's always less stuff.
I need it. I have three kids.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.320
You think I'm here for fun?

24:54.400 --> 24:57.240
That I like coming to the harbor
at 4:00 a.m. in this cold?

24:57.320 --> 25:00.160
And how come every time we talk,
you have one more kid?

25:00.240 --> 25:03.080
-The latest was born last week.
-Whatever. Stand back.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.960
I'm telling you. Watch out.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.240
Don't throw it like that.

25:10.880 --> 25:13.080
Guys, the cops are here! The cops, guys!

25:14.360 --> 25:16.000
Guys, here come the cops!

25:20.480 --> 25:21.320
Stop!

25:40.760 --> 25:41.920
Did it go badly again?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.960
Someone decided
that cigarette smuggling must stop.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.480
The next load is on Monday,
but I might go earlier.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.000
What are you doing here?

25:52.600 --> 25:53.840
Aren't you at the store?

25:55.440 --> 25:56.520
<i>Erry, we can't.</i>

25:56.600 --> 25:59.480
Doing it on the side is fine,
but you can't make a living from it.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.520
If no one has ever done it,
there's a reason.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.200
Yes, but my compilations
are really in demand.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.200
I can't meet all orders.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.800
And it'll be easy for us
to copy these records.

26:08.880 --> 26:10.520
Of course you can't meet all the orders.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.600
How many tapes
do you think you can make in a day?

26:13.680 --> 26:16.080
-It takes an hour to copy a one-hour tape.
-Okay.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.480
So one per hour per stereo.

26:17.560 --> 26:21.160
So, even if we bought two, three,
let's say five stereos,

26:21.240 --> 26:24.160
and we only slept five hours a night,
how many tapes can we make?

26:24.240 --> 26:25.880
-Fifty a day?
-That's right!

26:25.960 --> 26:28.520
That would be 50-60,000 lire net per day.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.480
Minus expenses, divided by two…

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Erry, it can't be done!

26:36.880 --> 26:39.440
Isn't there a faster way
to make the tapes?

26:40.840 --> 26:42.240
What do you mean, Francesca?

26:42.760 --> 26:45.080
I mean, people have gone to the moon.

26:45.160 --> 26:50.920
There must be something, like a device,
I don't know, that makes tapes faster.

26:51.760 --> 26:52.600
I mean…

27:07.440 --> 27:09.480
FLASH ELECTRONICS

27:10.520 --> 27:13.440
Wow! Basically, I mean…

27:14.160 --> 27:18.040
They've done this thing
where you can press a button on the TV,

27:18.120 --> 27:20.960
and you get pages like in a newspaper.

27:21.040 --> 27:24.840
It's called "teletext,"
but it's still being tested.

27:24.920 --> 27:25.800
How do you know?

27:26.600 --> 27:29.160
It's also written here.
Nothing here either though.

27:32.440 --> 27:36.680
Don Alfredo, forgive me for saying so,
but your products are very poor quality.

27:36.760 --> 27:38.920
Hey, kid, that's not how it works.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.400
If you want to read the magazines,
you have to buy them.

27:41.480 --> 27:44.240
So, you want me to buy 20 magazines
at face value

27:44.320 --> 27:46.120
without checking them first?

27:46.960 --> 27:49.040
I'll take that one.
<i>Electronics and Computers.</i>

27:49.560 --> 27:50.720
-This one?
-Yes.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.760
Guys, I found it.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.360
Duplicator Graff.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.040
It duplicates an hour-long tape
in two minutes.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.080
Really? This changes everything!

28:02.160 --> 28:03.160
Let me see.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.960
With full professional quality.

28:05.680 --> 28:08.040
I mean, what did I tell you?

28:08.120 --> 28:10.840
Is it possible that,
in the age of teletext,

28:10.920 --> 28:13.240
there's no such thing as…

28:14.680 --> 28:16.800
Erry, are you nuts?
It costs seven million.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.840
That changes everything again.

28:18.920 --> 28:22.440
We don't have money to rent the store,
let alone seven million.

28:22.520 --> 28:26.160
Erry, forget about it.
I told you, this can't be done.

28:28.560 --> 28:29.920
Unless…

28:34.400 --> 28:38.280
Unless we ask a family friend.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.080
-Don Mario, the boys are here.
-Okay.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.600
Good evening, Don Mario.

29:02.880 --> 29:03.760
Good evening.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.160
Well, Don Mario, to keep it short,

29:13.240 --> 29:16.480
me and my brother Enrico here, we thought

29:16.560 --> 29:20.040
since he's been in the record industry
for many years now,

29:20.120 --> 29:22.160
which, as you know, is on the rise--

29:22.240 --> 29:23.680
How much do you need?

29:24.960 --> 29:26.640
Eight million, Don Mario.

29:26.720 --> 29:31.840
Specifically, it would be seven million
for a professional duplicator

29:31.920 --> 29:33.960
and the rest to rent a store--

29:34.040 --> 29:36.280
Do you know the terms of the loan?

29:37.120 --> 29:38.680
We can imagine them.

29:38.760 --> 29:41.760
But since we're here,
if you could tell us again,

29:41.840 --> 29:42.920
to jog our memory.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.800
For eight million, after a month,
you have to pay me back nine.

29:46.560 --> 29:49.720
After two months, twelve.
After three, fifteen.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.040
After four, zero.

29:52.120 --> 29:55.320
The debt will be cancelled.
You won't have to repay me.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.480
-Now go!
-Yes.

30:02.560 --> 30:07.720
ERRY'S RECORD SHOP

30:07.800 --> 30:10.800
Guys, we said Madonna, Bennato,
and Vasco Rossi, right?

30:10.880 --> 30:12.200
It's 15,000 lire, please!

30:12.880 --> 30:14.800
How much longer for Battisti?

30:14.880 --> 30:17.840
It's a matter of minutes.
Enrico, how long for Battisti?

30:17.920 --> 30:19.440
-Hi. Listen.
-Hi.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.960
I bought the Gloria Jones version
of "Tainted Love" from you.

30:22.040 --> 30:24.440
Do you have the Soft Cell one too?

30:24.520 --> 30:26.680
What can you recommend about New Romantic?

30:27.560 --> 30:33.000
Well, about the first thing you mentioned,
there should be no problem.

30:33.080 --> 30:36.400
-As for the second--
-"Avalon" by Roxy Music.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.720
"Avalon"? What kind of advice is "Avalon"?

30:40.440 --> 30:42.240
"True" by Spandau Ballet, then.

30:42.320 --> 30:44.400
God, you'll say "Rio" by Duran Duran next.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.760
No, I would say "Forever Young"
by Alphaville.

30:46.840 --> 30:49.160
Not "Do You Really Want to Hurt Me"
by Culture Club?

30:49.240 --> 30:50.840
-"Vienna," Ultravox.
-"Too Shy."

30:50.920 --> 30:52.560
All right, you asked for it.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.960
"Mad World," Tears For Fears.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.520
I don't know it.

31:03.560 --> 31:06.880
Sure, because it's a genre
between new romantic and new wave.

31:06.960 --> 31:11.000
I know if you like new romantic songs,
you'll also like new wave songs.

31:11.720 --> 31:14.880
I can put them at the end of the tape
so you can listen to them.

31:15.760 --> 31:18.040
But if I don't like it,
you'll make me a new one.

31:20.720 --> 31:23.560
My God, what a pain in the ass she is.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.840
Erry, move. It's one hell of a day.

31:26.600 --> 31:27.480
Battisti!

31:27.560 --> 31:31.560
I… Battisti, I got it! It's here.
Battisti, let's look for it.

31:31.640 --> 31:35.480
Each LP we duplicate
lasts about 45 minutes, right?

31:35.560 --> 31:39.280
And since ours are one-hour tapes,
that's 60 minutes.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.600
We've got about 15 minutes left, right?

31:41.680 --> 31:43.240
No, Erry, don't do that.

31:43.320 --> 31:46.520
Don't say 35, 45, 15 while I'm counting.
I lose count!

31:46.600 --> 31:48.840
No, Peppino. Focus, it's important.

31:48.920 --> 31:51.200
Those 15 free minutes we have,

31:51.280 --> 31:53.880
we can fill them
with a music selection by DJ Erry.

31:53.960 --> 31:56.040
You're the DJ. Put whatever you like.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.440
No, that's the point.

31:57.520 --> 32:01.120
I won't choose based on what I like,
but based on the taste of the buyer.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.240
How do you know their taste?

32:03.320 --> 32:04.480
If you buy Duran Duran,

32:04.560 --> 32:08.040
I'm sure you'll also like Spandau Ballet,
even if you don't know them.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.640
If you listen to Joe Cocker,
you'll also like Zucchero.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.480
If you like the new romantics,
you like the new wave.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.720
I'll add them at the end,
and you'll listen to them.

32:15.800 --> 32:18.600
I bet you'll end up buying
Joe Cocker's tape as well.

32:18.680 --> 32:21.720
We get more music out there
and make more money.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.720
I didn't understand a word.
There's nine million here.

32:25.800 --> 32:26.840
Four million here.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.040
-Nine plus four?
-Thirteen.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.240
-How much?
-Thirteen million.

32:32.320 --> 32:35.240
Minus expenses
and the money we owe Don Mario,

32:36.040 --> 32:37.440
that's one million each.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.360
God, that's a lot of money!

32:42.600 --> 32:45.560
-What's wrong, Erry? Aren't you happy?
-I mean, I don't know.

32:45.640 --> 32:49.680
-We're just selling in the neighborhood.
-Who else do you want to sell them to?

32:49.760 --> 32:53.480
To other people
from other neighborhoods, other cities.

32:53.560 --> 32:55.120
And other regions too. Why not?

32:55.720 --> 32:56.600
Are you nuts?

32:56.680 --> 32:59.960
Listen, Peppì.
If we've sold all these tapes in 15 days,

33:00.040 --> 33:01.600
imagine if we got better organized.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.480
Even better?
Do you want to sell them in bulk?

33:04.560 --> 33:06.360
In stores? In market stalls?

33:06.440 --> 33:09.080
Good idea. I hadn't thought about that.

33:09.160 --> 33:11.120
Erry, forget it. It's not feasible.

33:11.200 --> 33:14.560
It would take a huge
capillary sales network that,

33:15.200 --> 33:16.800
as a matter of fact, we do

33:18.400 --> 33:19.280
have.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.640
Guys, let's face it.

33:26.280 --> 33:27.800
Everything is bound to end.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.080
Cigarettes have now reached the butt.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.240
But today,

33:32.040 --> 33:33.640
I want to talk about the future.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.120
And the future is a tape?

33:40.200 --> 33:43.680
-Not one, but tons of tapes.
-How much do you make on a carton?

33:43.760 --> 33:46.400
We make 150 a packet and 1,000 a carton.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.760
And we risk jail for 1,000 lire?

33:49.400 --> 33:51.760
We sell the tapes to you for 2,500 lire.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.680
You resell them for 5,000.

33:53.760 --> 33:58.000
Not five lire more, not five less.
We give you as many as you want.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.000
Zero risk,

33:59.880 --> 34:02.440
and we become rich. Both us and you guys.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.520
Don't you want to count it, Don Mario?

34:16.080 --> 34:17.200
I just did.

34:19.920 --> 34:23.600
By the way, Don Mario,
me and my brother Enrico,

34:23.680 --> 34:26.600
we kind of wanted to step up operations.

34:26.680 --> 34:29.320
In our small way,
even though the business is--

34:29.400 --> 34:30.520
How much do you need?

34:32.920 --> 34:34.360
We need 200 million.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.560
200 million?

34:37.640 --> 34:40.720
Actually, 210 to be exact.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.640
That is if you don't need round figures,
of course.

34:44.720 --> 34:46.080
<i>I'll be honest with you guys.</i>

34:46.160 --> 34:49.720
The prices depend
on the quantity of tapes you take.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.640
The minimum is 10,000 units.

34:51.720 --> 34:55.040
Below that number,
you can go buy them at the store.

34:55.120 --> 34:58.000
-Fine.
-Fine what? How many do you need?

34:58.680 --> 34:59.560
All of them.

34:59.640 --> 35:03.000
Guys, don't waste my time.
How many? 10,000, 15,000?

35:03.080 --> 35:06.800
We don't need 10 or 15,000.
We need all of them.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.440
Guys, let's get to work!

35:16.520 --> 35:20.320
These gentlemen want to buy a few tapes!
Hey, you!

35:34.800 --> 35:37.760
ERRY'S RECORD STORE

36:09.760 --> 36:10.920
Peppe, what time is it?

36:11.880 --> 36:13.720
You asked me two minutes ago.

36:13.800 --> 36:17.320
If it was 9:05 two minutes ago,
it's probably 9:07 now.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.920
Are you sure they understood?

36:21.560 --> 36:23.440
Yes! We fucking told them 50 times!

36:23.520 --> 36:26.000
These damn smugglers
don't understand shit!

36:26.080 --> 36:28.080
Maybe they just hit a little traffic.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.600
What traffic? You think they drive a car?

36:30.680 --> 36:33.920
I'm telling you, they've forgotten.
They're unreliable.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.480
That's the truth.

37:11.320 --> 37:12.760
Do you guys know who I am?

37:24.200 --> 37:27.880
<i>Hello? Orthopedic Trauma Center.</i>
<i>How can I help?</i>

37:27.960 --> 37:30.400
<i>-</i>Hello… Yes, good…
<i>-Hello?</i>

37:30.480 --> 37:32.160
Good morning. This is Enrico.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.520
<i>So what? What can I do for you?</i>

37:35.120 --> 37:37.320
I don't… I don't know.

37:37.400 --> 37:40.400
Maybe I need to talk
to someone I know there?

37:40.480 --> 37:43.320
<i>Listen, don't be cheeky.</i>
<i>I'm really not in the mood.</i>

37:43.400 --> 37:46.120
<i>A truckload of Moroccans</i>
<i>beaten to a pulp just arrived.</i>

37:46.200 --> 37:47.200
<i>Who do you want to--</i>

37:53.600 --> 37:56.200
You owe me ten million
for the damage you caused.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.720
And then you shut this shithole down.

38:07.800 --> 38:08.840
Good morning.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.640
Good morning!

38:14.720 --> 38:16.200
Hey, guys! I'm back!

38:18.400 --> 38:19.760
Why the long faces?

38:20.360 --> 38:23.640
What is it, kiddo?
Isn't uncle playing nice?

38:24.720 --> 38:27.280
Well, lucky for you, she takes after me.

38:28.080 --> 38:30.520
-Thank God.
-Angiolé.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.840
On your special day,
Mommy has made you your favorite dish.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.600
-Salted cod.
-No, Mom, you shouldn't have.

38:36.680 --> 38:37.680
But I wanted to.

38:38.520 --> 38:40.000
-Fine.
-Erry, you're not eating?

38:40.080 --> 38:42.600
-No. I'm not hungry today.
-Peppe, you neither?

38:43.360 --> 38:44.760
My stomach's in a knot.

38:44.840 --> 38:47.080
-Shall I make something else? A broth?
-No.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.680
A slice of meat with olive oil?

38:48.760 --> 38:51.080
-Guys, are you okay?
-Mom, everything's fine!

38:51.160 --> 38:54.040
Don't interrogate us
just because we're not eating.

38:54.120 --> 38:56.600
-We're just not hungry.
-I get it. I'll take the dishes.

38:56.680 --> 39:00.000
No, leave.
Maybe I'll have seconds. I'll eat it.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.480
Let me give you a hand, Mom.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.720
Don't worry. It's okay.
You've got the baby.

39:11.920 --> 39:14.440
So, guys what happened?

39:15.040 --> 39:18.320
Nothing happened, Dad.
Ups and downs at work.

39:19.680 --> 39:21.520
And how down are the downs?

39:24.720 --> 39:27.000
Well, Dad, what should we say? Let's see.

39:27.080 --> 39:30.080
There's this Moroccan mafia boss,

39:30.640 --> 39:33.840
who, overnight, sent a dozen
of his compatriots to the hospital

39:33.920 --> 39:36.000
after they dared to do business with us.

39:36.080 --> 39:39.480
He said if we don't close the shop
and give him ten million, he'll knife us.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.880
But all in all, this is a minor problem.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.000
What's really killing my appetite

39:44.080 --> 39:46.520
is that if we don't sell 80,000 tapes
within a month,

39:46.600 --> 39:48.440
and if we don't return 200 million
to Don Mario,

39:48.520 --> 39:50.640
there will be no more Frattasios.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.560
How about it?

39:52.640 --> 39:54.520
Are the downs down enough, Dad?

39:57.040 --> 39:58.080
Angelo.

39:59.240 --> 40:00.200
What do you think?

40:01.280 --> 40:02.120
About what?

40:02.800 --> 40:03.920
You know.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.360
About the fucker who's threatening them.

40:06.440 --> 40:07.280
Right, yeah.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.920
Well, I think it can be resolved.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.800
If someone goes there
and explains themselves properly,

40:12.880 --> 40:15.640
politely, of course, but firmly,

40:16.240 --> 40:18.320
I reckon it can be worked out.

40:18.400 --> 40:19.840
Plus, guys, honestly,

40:19.920 --> 40:22.560
if you don't eat this pasta with potatoes,
I will. It's a shame.

40:32.200 --> 40:35.080
Angiolé, are you sure
you only need a bit of equipment?

40:35.160 --> 40:37.480
If you want, we can take you there.

40:37.560 --> 40:40.200
Francesco told us
you were like a brother to him in prison.

40:40.280 --> 40:41.840
No, thanks. Better not.

40:41.920 --> 40:43.880
All we need is a friendly conversation.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.800
There was a misunderstanding,
and we need some stage props.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.960
Just for one night.
I'll bring it all back tomorrow.

40:51.040 --> 40:54.800
Angiolé, I've put in the bare minimum.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.840
Tell me if you need anything else.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.560
What are you packing?

40:59.640 --> 41:00.800
You like it?

41:00.880 --> 41:03.400
We're preparing for New Year's Eve.

41:03.480 --> 41:06.440
Half a kilo of TNT on a 30-second fuse.

41:06.520 --> 41:09.080
It's like an atom bomb.
All it needs is a name.

41:09.160 --> 41:11.240
Something important sounding, impressive.

41:12.920 --> 41:14.120
How many do you have?

41:15.320 --> 41:18.080
<i>…the choreography,</i>
<i>and a beautiful choreographer!</i>

41:18.160 --> 41:22.480
<i>Because he's such a great dancer.</i>
<i>So great, so great, that he can't dance!</i>

41:27.400 --> 41:29.480
<i>My dear friends, all is well that ends--</i>

42:12.680 --> 42:14.000
What the fuck are you doing?

42:16.080 --> 42:18.720
So, basically,
we've taken down the antenna,

42:19.240 --> 42:21.280
and now we're pulling it with a wire.

42:23.360 --> 42:24.880
Do you both want to die?!

42:24.960 --> 42:26.040
Die? No.

42:26.120 --> 42:29.400
Also, we brothers are not only two, but

42:29.480 --> 42:30.320
three.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.040
Look, I'll tell you the truth.

42:34.600 --> 42:36.480
This is the best night of my life.

42:37.120 --> 42:41.680
Believe me though. The thought
of going home now without firing a shot

42:41.760 --> 42:42.840
makes my heart ache.

42:42.920 --> 42:46.880
Unless you do something so stupid
that forces me to pull the trigger--

42:46.960 --> 42:49.960
-You're fucking up--
-That's exactly what I meant!

42:50.680 --> 42:53.640
Please, say one more word
so can shoot you in the head,

42:53.720 --> 42:55.920
and we'll splatter
Moroccan brains everywhere!

42:56.000 --> 42:58.240
All right, come with me. Walk.

43:00.200 --> 43:01.040
On your knees.

43:06.480 --> 43:07.400
Look.

43:07.480 --> 43:10.040
I want to tell you something because

43:10.120 --> 43:13.960
sometimes we can seem
a little naive, messed-up.

43:14.040 --> 43:15.800
And sometimes we are, but

43:16.520 --> 43:17.520
not this time.

43:18.360 --> 43:19.280
Not this time.

43:20.040 --> 43:22.960
You have 24 hours to leave Naples
and never be seen again.

43:23.800 --> 43:25.040
And remember.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.440
The Frattasio brothers

43:28.280 --> 43:30.240
only forgive once.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.400
And remember,

43:46.520 --> 43:48.240
the Frattasio brothers

43:49.120 --> 43:50.960
only forgive once!

43:52.920 --> 43:54.200
Whatever. It didn't…

43:54.280 --> 43:57.720
Something was meant to happen
to justify my theatrical antics.

43:57.800 --> 44:00.720
-But something must have…
-Maybe there was a snag.

44:00.800 --> 44:03.760
Of course. We've been here
talking about making a scene,

44:03.840 --> 44:05.120
and we ended up looking like--

44:08.920 --> 44:12.600
<i>From that moment on, things got wild.</i>

44:12.680 --> 44:15.640
MIXED BY ERRY
THE IDEAL DIMENSION FOR A CLEAR SOUND

44:18.400 --> 44:21.080
<i>Forcella became</i>
<i>the "Mixed by Erry" neighborhood,</i>

44:21.160 --> 44:23.680
<i>as half a neighborhood</i>
<i>benefited from our work.</i>

44:24.440 --> 44:28.560
<i>And every day, the number of customers</i>
<i>entering our store grew twofold,</i>

44:28.640 --> 44:31.360
<i>threefold, a hundredfold.</i>

44:31.440 --> 44:34.800
…everyone. The gentleman
in the front row, let's recap.

44:34.880 --> 44:37.760
A thousand Christmas compilations,
we said 200 Zucchero,

44:37.840 --> 44:40.040
Vasco Rossi, and let's add U2.

44:40.120 --> 44:41.040
See you in two hours.

44:41.120 --> 44:44.240
If you want lunch, pizza is ready
and is on Mixed by Erry. Quick!

44:44.320 --> 44:47.800
<i>The record shop was now only used</i>
<i>for wholesale orders</i>

44:47.880 --> 44:51.760
<i>because the heart of our business</i>
<i>had moved to the laboratories.</i>

44:59.000 --> 45:01.960
<i>We had ten laboratories working nonstop.</i>

45:02.040 --> 45:06.240
<i>We had to hire over a hundred employees</i>
<i>to manage everything.</i>

45:17.320 --> 45:18.200
Go.

45:18.280 --> 45:21.200
<i>Much more widespread</i>
<i>than the official distribution,</i>

45:21.280 --> 45:26.520
<i>Mixed by Erry could arrive in towns</i>
<i>where there were no record stores.</i>

45:26.600 --> 45:29.680
<i>A lot of kids now had access to music.</i>

45:29.760 --> 45:32.240
<i>And in addition</i>
<i>to our personal satisfaction,</i>

45:32.320 --> 45:34.440
<i>we also earned a little money.</i>

45:35.800 --> 45:39.440
<i>Well, to be honest,</i>
<i>a lot more than a little money.</i>

45:41.520 --> 45:44.000
<i>In the mid-1980s, in a single week,</i>

45:44.080 --> 45:48.720
<i>we were earning way more</i>
<i>than a regular person did in a lifetime.</i>

45:49.560 --> 45:50.520
130!

45:51.160 --> 45:56.240
<i>It's a strange feeling when, suddenly,</i>
<i>you can afford anything.</i>

45:56.320 --> 45:58.320
<i>We could buy literally anything.</i>

45:58.840 --> 46:01.040
THE 2 SWANS DISCO

46:01.120 --> 46:03.680
<i>And, to be honest,</i>
<i>we gave ourselves some treats.</i>

46:21.880 --> 46:23.400
Erry, come on, let's go!

46:24.400 --> 46:27.880
Angelo, come on.
There are loads of people. I don't--

46:27.960 --> 46:29.800
-So what?
-I'd better go home. I--

46:29.880 --> 46:31.800
Don't start. What did we say?

46:31.880 --> 46:35.360
You show up, play some tunes,
and we leave. What's the big deal?

46:35.440 --> 46:37.640
Why do we have to? I don't get it.

46:37.720 --> 46:39.560
Erry, for all sorts of reasons.

46:39.640 --> 46:42.800
First, the money we'll get.
Second, you promote the brand.

46:42.880 --> 46:46.560
Third, you're always on your own
in the store with your headphones on. Sad!

46:46.640 --> 46:50.320
-What's that got to do with--
-You're always alone. It's sad, okay?

46:50.400 --> 46:53.640
And now, the most important moment
of this great night.

46:53.720 --> 46:58.800
Let's give a shout-out
to our super guest, Mixed by Erry!

46:58.880 --> 47:00.880
Hands in the air, everyone!

47:00.960 --> 47:03.360
Erry, you're the best! I'm a big fan.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.320
We've met before?

47:05.920 --> 47:07.840
No, I don't think so.

47:14.880 --> 47:16.080
I'm from Forcella.

47:33.800 --> 47:35.600
My brother takes advantage of that,

47:35.680 --> 47:39.160
and he forces me to come to these events,
which I don't…

47:39.760 --> 47:41.840
I mean, I like making compilations.

47:42.960 --> 47:47.520
Come to think of it,
I never made you the new romantic tape.

47:47.600 --> 47:50.280
-I guess I should apologize.
-I guess so.

47:50.360 --> 47:53.920
I came twice, and you weren't there.
Neither you nor the tape.

47:54.000 --> 47:59.160
You're right, but now
I don't work in the record store anymore.

47:59.240 --> 48:01.720
We're in other places now, so

48:02.360 --> 48:03.840
you won't find me. Whatever!

48:03.920 --> 48:05.600
How can I make it up to you?

48:06.800 --> 48:10.040
How does a guy
usually make it up to a girl?

48:13.480 --> 48:15.800
I've asked myself this question too.

48:15.880 --> 48:19.360
How could a guy make it up to a girl--

48:19.440 --> 48:21.640
-Erry, you're the best!
-Thank you.

48:23.240 --> 48:25.680
I could make a new romantic tape for you.

48:25.760 --> 48:29.000
Right away. We go to our lab.
I have all the equipment--

48:29.080 --> 48:30.120
Your laboratory?

48:30.720 --> 48:31.760
The laboratory.

48:31.840 --> 48:35.360
I mean, not that
there's a scientist with an ampule.

48:35.440 --> 48:37.160
It's where we do the duplication.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.640
We call them labs, but

48:40.240 --> 48:44.080
now that you mention it,
I don't know why we call them that.

48:44.160 --> 48:45.880
Anyway, I'll show you if we go.

48:47.240 --> 48:49.440
Now? At two o'clock in the morning?

48:50.040 --> 48:52.520
No, not now. Better not.

48:53.240 --> 48:54.840
It's two o'clock in the morning.

48:56.760 --> 48:57.640
Maybe tomorrow?

49:08.640 --> 49:09.480
Good evening.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.280
-Good evening.
-Girls, a croissant or a grappa?

49:12.360 --> 49:13.280
Salvatore?

49:14.080 --> 49:18.280
Who's this guy driving around
the neighborhood in a yellow Lamborghini?

49:18.360 --> 49:21.000
He's one of the Frattasio brothers,
the youngest.

49:21.080 --> 49:25.160
What do these Frattasio brothers do
to drive a Lamborghini?

49:25.240 --> 49:27.080
You don't know them, Don Carmine?

49:27.160 --> 49:29.680
They're the ones
behind Mixed by Erry, the tapes.

49:29.760 --> 49:32.160
They're on every market stall.
They're so famous.

49:32.760 --> 49:36.480
Salvatore, go and get me one.
I'm curious to hear it.

49:44.320 --> 49:46.360
And these are the labs.

49:48.680 --> 49:50.080
I mean, this is one of them.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.480
We actually have ten.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.080
So this is where I DJ now.

50:00.680 --> 50:02.200
You wanna hear something nice?

50:17.040 --> 50:18.000
I can't hear anything.

50:18.960 --> 50:20.000
Oh, right.

50:37.960 --> 50:39.040
What's this song?

50:39.120 --> 50:41.280
They launched it yesterday
at the Sanremo Festival.

50:41.360 --> 50:44.480
Tomorrow we release the compilation,
ten days before the official one.

50:45.560 --> 50:48.520
You release the Sanremo compilation
before the official one?

50:51.200 --> 50:53.200
You DJ in an odd way.

50:54.760 --> 50:55.760
What do you mean?

50:56.360 --> 50:58.200
I just mean that

50:59.320 --> 51:01.320
all this music belongs to other people.

51:01.400 --> 51:04.120
Yeah, I mean, that's what a DJ does.

51:04.200 --> 51:07.200
They use other people's music
to get people to listen.

51:07.280 --> 51:08.920
Yes. Yes, of course.

51:10.960 --> 51:13.120
I just don't know if a DJ makes

51:13.920 --> 51:15.280
all these tapes.

51:18.320 --> 51:21.440
Actually, I don't know
how many tapes a DJ makes.

51:21.520 --> 51:23.120
But I DJ in my own way.

51:24.880 --> 51:27.520
You don't like it? It's not good?

51:32.320 --> 51:33.160
Yes.

51:34.960 --> 51:35.920
I like it.

51:57.440 --> 52:01.080
-Damn it! We've been looking for you!
-Guys, this is not a good time.

52:01.160 --> 52:03.360
I'm busy. I have people here--

52:03.440 --> 52:05.840
Erry, the Lion sent for us.

52:05.920 --> 52:08.200
He wants to see us. Now.

52:09.600 --> 52:10.520
Now?

52:46.160 --> 52:48.000
Let's go!

53:06.920 --> 53:08.120
You!

53:22.200 --> 53:23.040
Thank you.

53:25.040 --> 53:27.240
Which of you three is Mixed by Erry?

53:28.920 --> 53:32.920
Technically all three of us,
especially if we refer to the company.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.320
-If we talk--
-Guys, who the fuck is Erry?

53:35.400 --> 53:36.560
That's him.

53:36.640 --> 53:38.760
-Come with me. Let's go.
-Okay.

53:53.640 --> 53:56.560
You must be the famous Mixed by Erry.

53:56.640 --> 53:57.840
Nothing less.

53:57.920 --> 53:59.280
It's such an honor.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.840
I've listened to some tapes. They're good.

54:04.760 --> 54:05.640
Thank you.

54:07.600 --> 54:08.560
Are you having fun?

54:09.720 --> 54:12.560
-Are you enjoying the party?
-Yes, a lot.

54:13.680 --> 54:16.240
-I saw there's also--
-Oh, yes.

54:16.760 --> 54:19.360
We have guests. A few friends visiting us.

54:20.280 --> 54:22.200
We're young. We like to have fun.

54:26.200 --> 54:27.040
Erry.

54:28.840 --> 54:30.000
I'll be honest with you.

54:30.520 --> 54:32.920
I've been through something lately.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.040
Between my brother in jail,
the assholes from the DA's office,

54:36.120 --> 54:39.080
and the bunch of ignorant old men
who are the other families,

54:40.000 --> 54:42.960
I hadn't heard
about the talk of the neighborhood.

54:43.720 --> 54:45.400
Mixed by Erry!

54:46.960 --> 54:49.800
No. Thank you. Thank you, really.

54:52.800 --> 54:55.280
I heard that business has turned serious.

54:56.640 --> 54:58.520
You're making a lot of money.

54:58.600 --> 55:00.440
You sell all over Italy.

55:00.520 --> 55:03.360
I wouldn't say all over Italy.
Mostly in the south.

55:05.880 --> 55:07.560
Yet you know what I was thinking?

55:08.280 --> 55:11.240
To earn as much as you do,
I risk three life sentences.

55:12.560 --> 55:13.760
What do you risk?

55:17.920 --> 55:20.360
I mean, I basically make tapes.

55:20.440 --> 55:23.040
I'm just a DJ.

55:24.400 --> 55:25.840
How many brothers are you?

55:26.640 --> 55:27.680
There are three of us.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.720
From today, there are four brothers.

55:31.240 --> 55:32.240
There's me too.

55:36.160 --> 55:38.840
Anyway, let's not panic.

55:38.920 --> 55:41.480
It was just an offer.
A confusing one, by the way.

55:41.560 --> 55:44.720
And the thing about the brothers, Erry…
Three, four…

55:44.800 --> 55:47.520
Maybe we just misread the situation.

55:47.600 --> 55:50.920
What we care about now is music.
That's what we should worry about.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.920
Polygram, for example.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.400
Take Polygram. No one expected
that it would merge with Philips.

55:56.480 --> 55:58.480
But they did great things together.

55:58.560 --> 56:01.640
But if Polygram had refused
to join up with Philips,

56:01.720 --> 56:03.760
Philips wouldn't have killed them
with a hammer.

56:03.840 --> 56:06.560
-What's the hammer got to do with it?
-A lot.

56:06.640 --> 56:10.680
I am making a careful, lucid analysis
of the downsides and the upsides.

56:10.760 --> 56:13.880
-There are no upsides.
-This is no way to talk! You talk, then!

56:13.960 --> 56:16.360
Independence is the most important thing.

56:16.440 --> 56:19.800
We can't have all this taken
by the first fool who comes along.

56:19.880 --> 56:21.960
He looks nothing like a fool.

56:22.040 --> 56:23.640
How could you even consider

56:23.720 --> 56:26.440
letting them in
on what we've grafted so hard to build?

56:26.520 --> 56:30.200
I'm considering it
because I don't see many other options…

56:33.760 --> 56:35.760
if we want to keep on breathing.

56:49.040 --> 56:51.080
<i>We got out of it with a stroke of luck</i>

56:51.160 --> 56:54.920
<i>because that curly kid had set out</i>
<i>to change an age-old criminal system.</i>

56:55.600 --> 56:57.680
<i>And the old families didn't like that.</i>

56:57.760 --> 57:01.160
<i>Three dead and one injured in four hours</i>
<i>yesterday in the Naples area.</i>

57:01.240 --> 57:04.280
…although the fierce war
raging in recent days

57:04.360 --> 57:05.480
<i>has claimed five victims…</i>

57:05.560 --> 57:07.880
…the control of drugs and arms trafficking

57:07.960 --> 57:09.680
is behind the massacre in Marcianise.

57:09.760 --> 57:12.480
Four people of the New Family were killed.

57:12.560 --> 57:14.160
<i>…a real massacre by…</i>

57:14.240 --> 57:16.000
<i>These images were filmed in…</i>

57:16.080 --> 57:18.080
<i>The war broke out that very night.</i>

57:18.160 --> 57:22.240
<i>And we, along with our tapes,</i>
<i>were completely overshadowed.</i>

57:24.720 --> 57:28.240
<i>But the real trouble was yet to begin.</i>

57:39.360 --> 57:40.800
Who the fuck are they?

58:06.920 --> 58:08.560
NAPOLI ITALIAN CHAMPION

58:19.240 --> 58:23.640
<i>Oh life, oh my life</i>

58:23.720 --> 58:26.880
<i>Oh, heart of this heart</i>

58:26.960 --> 58:30.120
<i>You were my first love</i>

58:30.200 --> 58:33.720
<i>The first and last you will be for me</i>

58:33.800 --> 58:36.160
<i>Oh life, oh my life…</i>

58:40.920 --> 58:44.840
<i>You were my first love</i>

58:44.920 --> 58:45.840
Guys, let's go.

58:46.600 --> 58:49.600
-Where? The party's here.
-The party's over. Turn around.

58:49.680 --> 58:52.400
-How do I turn around?
-Turn the fuck around!

58:52.480 --> 58:55.400
-Go! Peppe! Move to the side, please!
-Guys! Excuse us?

58:55.480 --> 59:00.120
Guys, move! Please! Get out of the way!

59:06.280 --> 59:09.760
<i>Deep down, we knew that moment</i>
<i>would come sooner or later.</i>

59:22.480 --> 59:24.920
That's it!
We've been slapped on the front page.

59:25.440 --> 59:28.320
"Pirates."
That's what they call us now, "pirates."

59:28.400 --> 59:30.360
What do we have to do with pirates?

59:30.960 --> 59:33.400
I like the name. It's kind of poetic.

59:33.480 --> 59:35.560
I knew the police would show up.

59:35.640 --> 59:38.480
Can't you see the poetry?
Tell me where you see it!

59:38.560 --> 59:41.640
You know what pirates look like?
They have one eye, and the hook--

59:41.720 --> 59:43.880
-What do we care what they call us?
-I care.

59:43.960 --> 59:47.720
We still don't know how many labs
they seized, and you care about the name!

59:47.800 --> 59:50.800
Tell me something.
On what grounds can they do this?

59:50.880 --> 59:53.440
What can they do to us?
We're not doing anything illegal.

59:53.520 --> 59:56.760
They raided three labs.
You think they could do that otherwise?

59:56.840 --> 01:00:00.240
I think we were right
in a legal gray area.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.280
If we've broken any laws,
I'm sure they're few and fuzzy.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.720
We do everything off the books.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.880
We don't pay any taxes.
We don't issue receipts.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.680
We don't even have a cash register.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.720
As if the problem was the cash register!

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.560
Bar Gianni has been open since the war
and has never had one.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.040
Is Gianni from Bar Gianni
driving a Lamborghini?

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.320
Here we go again
with that fucking Lamborghini!

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.520
He just can't stand it.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.440
You know what?
This is just an act to intimidate us.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.760
It's Captain Ricciardi.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.960
He's been a stickler for the law
from the time of cigarette smuggling.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.240
He's like a sheriff!

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.600
But it's just one guy. What can he do?

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.480
Worst case, he slows our production down.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.200
Our production cannot slow down.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:38.960
They want to wage war on us?

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.000
Fine. We'll get ready to win the war.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.840
And we'll also buy a cash register.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:52.320
"All capital assets may be conferred.
Sincerely, signed…"

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.640
<i>We gave our structure</i>
<i>a semblance of legality.</i>

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.600
<i>In one day, we founded Mixed by Erry SRL,</i>

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.440
<i>Francesca Import, Teresa SAS,</i>
<i>Erry Show, and TNF Services.</i>

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.280
<i>The companies helped us move the capital</i>

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:09.080
<i>and were also the official interface</i>
<i>for business with major clients.</i>

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.920
<i>Ten labs were no longer enough.</i>
<i>We needed twice as many.</i>

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.640
There are three vacant apartments.
If you want to see them, I have the keys.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.440
-What's the condo fee?
-It depends on the apartment you choose.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.560
No. I meant the condo fee
for the whole building.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.280
Tell the tenants they no longer
have to pay. We'll take care of it.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.760
God, why do you want
to pay for everything?

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.520
Precisely to avoid
these kinds of questions.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.720
By the way,
we'll take all three apartments.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.800
<i>Plus another five,</i>
<i>actionable within an hour,</i>

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.920
<i>in case of seizure</i>
<i>by the Financial Police.</i>

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.400
<i>And the Financial Police wouldn't give up.</i>

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.600
<i>But by then, we were ready for war.</i>

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.960
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Financial Police.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.440
We need to raid the building.
Will you open up?

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.760
<i>The number of employees doubled.</i>

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:59.440
<i>We fed hundreds of families,</i>
<i>and everyone loved us.</i>

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.760
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Financial Police. Will you open up?

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.040
<i>No, I'm not buying anything.</i>

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.800
Break the fucking door down!

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.160
Come on!

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.280
Go! Go, guys!

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:55.240
Go!

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.840
Guys, as you can see, this one
is 50,000 times bigger than the other one.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.280
We'll do just fine here. Trust me.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.600
<i>The counterfeiting problem is,</i>
<i>I believe, a serious one.</i>

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:08.600
<i>Sorry, you can't film here.</i>

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.840
<i>The operations of the Financial Police</i>
<i>attracted the interest of journalists.</i>

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.120
<i>-This is a business.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.760
<i>We're talking about thousands of lire.</i>

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.640
They're defrauding the State.
They're infringing copyright.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:23.440
Who are the pirates?
The ones who counterfeit music.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.680
<i>The term "pirate" was now commonly used.</i>

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.720
<i>Everyone knew how lucrative</i>
<i>and relatively low-risk it was.</i>

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:32.800
<i>So, piracy increased tenfold</i>
<i>within a few months.</i>

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.800
What the fuck is he doing?

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.960
What is this?

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.600
They're tapes, sir. What else?

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.080
Look here.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.680
We even have
the latest Sanremo compilation.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.560
Are you fucking kidding me?
Sanremo started last night.

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.960
What can I tell you, sir?
If you want it, it's 5,000 lire.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.360
5,000 lire?

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.560
Yes, but the sound is perfect.
I can guarantee it.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.240
However, if you want to save money…

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.960
<i>Guess which was</i>
<i>the most pirated label in Italy?</i>

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.720
…here is the fake one.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.960
What do you mean the fake one?
What's the other one?

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.200
Well, sir, sorry, but

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.680
this is an original fake.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:34.040
Four is not enough. I need at least seven.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.720
Side bleachers? Are you crazy?

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.840
Do you want my father-in-law
to kill me? No.

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.560
We've lost all sense of proportion here.

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.240
Things are getting out of hand.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.560
Hold on a second, Mimmo.
Stay on the line, please.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.600
Ricciardi, what do you want?
Can't you see I'm busy?

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.480
I need an arrest warrant.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.000
Who do you need it for?

01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.960
Counterfeiters of music tapes.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.440
You want to arrest people
making mix tapes?

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.520
They make a lot of them, sir.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.600
They sell them at the market in Naples
and, I think, across Italy.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:12.880
We've raided them, but they keep on going.
No choice but to arrest them.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:16.080
What about those cigarette smugglers?
Shall we kill them?

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.000
Or we could burn the drug dealers.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.440
I'll be clear. Their business is huge.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:24.440
They come out with a Sanremo compilation
while the festival is still on.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.640
They get copied by other counterfeiters,
passing them off as originals.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.320
It's all so confusing!

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.120
I am confused indeed.
Do you have any evidence?

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.800
I told you!
The market stalls in Naples are full!

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.600
What should I tell the magistrate?

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.880
We go for a walk along the seafront,
buy some taralli?

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.200
-Along the way--
-Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.400
No, Ricciardi. Do me a favor.

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.600
-This morning, keep out of my sight.
-Let me--

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:51.960
Okay? I'm carrying out a very complicated
act of persuasion right now.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.040
If I lose focus, I can't do it.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.080
Now get out. Go!

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:01.280
Mimmo, listen. I just had an idea.
Tell me if you like it.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:05.240
I will come in person with ten patrols
and shut you all down.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.680
You'll never sell
another Caffè Borghetti again.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.040
This place will be extinct.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:50.160
How much longer for my 500 copies
of Antonello Venditti?

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.920
-I've been here for half an hour!
-This just came. I'm sure it's in here.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:54.840
Yes!

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:58.240
I don't know if Mr. Erry…
You know, I wrote a love song…

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.840
-You came yesterday too!
-I come every day. I--

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.080
Excuse me,
I'd like to speak to Mr. Erry too.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.760
-I only have to hand the tape to him.
-Well, that's not how it works!

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.360
-Where are the Latin American records?
-Erry! I'm leaving the tape here!

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.520
I dream of being a singer, sir!
I come every day.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.480
I have a nice voice. I'll sing for you.

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.560
No! You can't sing here. Please!

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.800
-Songs are born out of pain.
-Ciro, take care of this.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:23.200
-You do have a nice voice.
-Thanks.

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.840
-Come upstairs.
-He does!

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.920
Come upstairs with me. Thank you.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.200
Erry, for the hundredth time,

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.400
when you come down to the desk,
don't talk to singers.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.280
Otherwise, they start fighting,
and that's bad.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.280
Peppì, I understand them.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.960
Our compilations are the only way
for them to be heard.

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:40.240
Erry, what's all this patronage now?

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:43.080
We've always dealt with Italian,
international music.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.680
These amateur singers…

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.800
One more thing.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.360
Erry, no more flamenco.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.560
-Flamenco?
-Yes, flamenco.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.520
Your obsession with Spanish music
makes no sense.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:55.560
That's why all the records disappeared!
Peppì, listen.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.560
First, it's not Flamenco.
It's Latin American.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.600
Secondly, Latin American music
is the future.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.800
What? People see it's in Spanish,
and they don't buy it.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.720
You know what we should do?
Compilations of holy music.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.640
-You mean church music compilations?
-Yes.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.080
I already have five or six requests
from parishes.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.800
I think it's fair
that we also meet the demands of…

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:49.840
Who's the mole?

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.680
What do you mean?

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:58.000
How can you sell Sanremo's tapes on stalls
while it's still happening?

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.360
Someone from RAI TV
gives you the music masters. Who?

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.160
And why should I tell you?

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.760
He's funny!

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.880
He's funny… Yeah.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.200
Kiddo, people count to ten
before speaking to me.

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:22.160
-I haven't seen you count yet.
-No, let's not make things worse.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:27.040
First and foremost, the Captain
is certainly here as a private citizen.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:30.600
As he's without a security detail
or a warrant, so…

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.680
Why don't we have a coffee?

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.240
Go get three coffees.

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:37.280
I'll ask you one last time.
Who is the fucking mole?

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.440
Do you think you can scare me?

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.240
I've been standing up to bullies like you
since I was a child.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.640
-I'm hated just because I'm like this.
-Like what?

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:50.280
You claim to be a DJ,
but you're just a counterfeiter.

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.960
You have no talent!

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.960
You can't stand that someone here
is doing things differently!

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.640
Lucky for you, you are still a free man!

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.280
But I promise I'll throw you in jail
sooner or later

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.000
and make sure you'll never get out!

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.800
We'll send three squad cars here!
You people shouldn't even be here!

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.200
This is an illegal store!

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.600
Hi, Carlo.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.440
Always good when I hear from you.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:14.800
Listen, there's another mistake
on the list of top buyers.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.080
Take a good look at the letter M.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.080
Yes, like Monza.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.000
Yes.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:27.000
There was an order for five billion lire
in blank tapes

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.680
from a certain Mixed by Erry SRL.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.560
Now, as I'm the one presenting
these documents to the BoD,

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.360
I can't check every time with the pencil--

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.760
What? It's not a mistake?

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.440
Who the fuck is buying
five billion lire worth of blank tapes?

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:55.720
Hey, Stefania.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:00.840
Gentlemen, may I say
it is an honor to meet you in person.

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.160
-You must be Erry.
-Yes.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.920
I listened to all your compilations.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.040
-Amazing! I'm a big fan.
-Thanks.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.280
-You must be Peppe. Arturo.
-My pleasure.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.360
-And Angelo.
-My pleasure.

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:13.440
This is Carlo Pineschi,
our excellent commercial director.

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.640
Have you guys had lunch?

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.480
I made a reservation
at a seafood restaurant.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:20.920
I know! Now you'll be thinking
that eating fish in Milan…

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.960
Let me change your mind.
Do you have a car?

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.880
-Yes.
-Guys, follow us.

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.320
Here are the white wines.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:31.640
Tenuta Sant'Ignazio. How many bottles
have they produced this year?

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.400
Unfortunately, they've produced
less than a hundred.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.480
But we are lucky to have two of them.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.200
We'll take them both, then.
This is a very special occasion.

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.600
Would you like to try
an interesting white wine?

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.720
You might not like it though.
It's a bit intense, very mineral.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.360
It's good. We'll take it.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.680
Gentlemen, I'll be frank with you
about why I brought you here.

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.600
I don't know if you know that our company,

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.320
besides dealing
with a number of other things,

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:01.080
has always been extremely interested
in new enterprises.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.360
And I have to say, quite frankly,
that we noticed yours immediately.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.280
I'll keep it brief.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:12.440
We would love to have exclusive rights
to the supply of blank tapes.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.840
Wait, I have to tell you right away

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:18.040
that me and Carlo,
who's starting to kick me under the table,

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.400
he's getting pissed off,
but I'll say it anyway.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:27.560
We have come up with an offer
that I think you will find hard to refuse.

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:30.680
Talking about the serious stuff,
where are the crudités? Dario?

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:31.880
Yes, sir?

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.960
Bring us some crudités, please?

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:34.960
Yes, sure.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:44.920
<i>That was Arturo Maria Barambani,</i>
<i>CEO of ***.</i>

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.960
<i>A regular in the top ten</i>
<i>highest-paid managers in Italy,</i>

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:48.960
<i>as per Forbes.</i>

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:54.200
<i>He told us that the single-supplier system</i>
<i>was the most convenient for all concerned.</i>

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.320
<i>Revenue increases of more than 30%,</i>
<i>punctual and customized delivery,</i>

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.680
<i>huge discounts,</i>
<i>and a nearly unlimited credit line.</i>

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.080
Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.920
The good Giulio will now take you
to the airport. We'll be in touch soon.

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.520
So, thanks for the great company.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.520
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Arturo.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.520
Come and visit us in Naples.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.320
Sure. Of course.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.840
-Go now. Have a good trip.
-Thank you.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.600
Have a safe flight. Bye!

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:44.200
Amazing!

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:48.440
Do you get it? They represent 70%
of the market, and they're with us.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:54.000
Tomorrow, those assholes from *** and ***
will eat their own hearts out.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.800
It's great news! Why aren't you happy?

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:58.440
Arturo, come on.

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.720
Everyone knows what they do with tapes.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.480
I don't, for example. Do you know?
Did we talk about it at lunch?

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.520
We didn't talk about it. We don't know.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.080
Plus, Carlo,
we're selling fucking blank tapes.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.400
What the fuck
are they going to do with them?

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.280
Actually, do you want to know the truth?

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.720
For 15 billion a year,

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:23.480
they can even go whale hunting,
build landmines with them, enrich uranium.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.960
I don't give a shit!

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.320
The fish wasn't that great.

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.800
But everything else went great.

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.640
-We made an excellent deal.
-We did, indeed!

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.320
In fact, with his discount,
we'll increase turnover by at least 25%.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.720
-Please pull over.
-Here?

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.080
-Yes!
-Erry, what are you doing?

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.720
We'll miss the flight! Enrico!

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.000
Enrico!

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.320
Erry, have you gone nuts?

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:27.520
Erry!

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.720
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.560
How did it go in Milan?

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.280
It went well. I brought you a gift.

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:42.680
-Everything fine, Erry? You look weird.
-Yeah, everything's fine.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.840
We cut a deal
that will make us a lot of money.

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.520
So, why aren't you happy?

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.560
I don't know. When I look back,
this whole circus…

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:58.560
The oysters in Milan, the director,
the Financial Police…

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.880
I just wanted to be a DJ.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.960
Teresa, if I stopped being Mixed by Erry,
would you still be with me?

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.720
No, Erry. No.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:20.520
First, 'cause I'm still waiting
for that new romantic tape.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:27.000
Also, because I can't keep receiving
such awful presents.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.520
You don't like the globe with the Duomo?

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.960
That's weird. I think it's beautiful.

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:40.400
I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.720
But maybe you haven't shaken it yet.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.720
Because when you do that,
something happens.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.760
Everything changes.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:17.000
Wait a minute, sir.
Let's have one with the godfather.

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:20.240
-Please, sir.
-Here I come! Here's the godfather!

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:23.840
Thanks a lot.

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:30.600
Dearest Enrico, I want to thank you again
for the honor you gave me.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.560
No way! I'm the one who should thank you
for everything you've done for us.

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:38.160
Now I have to run.
My plane leaves in an hour and a half.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.200
You have to go now?

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.320
The fresh mozzarella from Battipaglia
is coming now.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.160
I know, my dear friend.

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:49.160
I have a meeting early tomorrow morning.
A very boring one which I can't miss.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.760
We also have the record label, you know.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.680
Occasionally, I have to meet
the whole shebang and take stock.

01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:00.680
Listen, before I go, though,
I have something for little Carmen.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:01.600
Walter!

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.400
Oh my God, Arturo!
You really are something!

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.520
It's beautiful!

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:12.480
An old man eating spaghetti.

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:17.800
No, it's <i>A Man Eating Spaghetti.</i>
That's the actual title.

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:21.920
It's by a rather famous painter
named Guttuso.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.680
Since he died recently,
the value is bound to increase.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.960
I wonder how much you paid for it.
It's so big. Peppino!

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.920
-Yes?
-Look at the gift Arturo got me.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.440
-Look here. Look.
-Wow! It's beautiful!

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:38.120
-What is it? An old man eating pasta?
-No!

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.840
<i>A Man Eating Spaghetti,</i>
a very famous painting.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.000
Forgive my brother. He's ignorant.

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.680
-He is a man of a certain age who--
-Peppe?

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.080
-What?
-I'm going to get dessert.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:49.520
The kids are with your father.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.280
-Keep an eye on them before they kill him.
-Guys, I'm off.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.400
-I'm going back to Milan.
-All right, Arturo.

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.800
I'll talk to you on Monday
about that thing.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:59.640
Girls, be good. Don't annihilate Grandpa.

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.200
-Dad, you want a break? They're terrible.
-Are you crazy?

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:06.440
For once, I can enjoy my granddaughters.
Do you want to stay with Grandpa?

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:08.080
-Yes!
-See, Peppì?

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.400
You go talk to your mother. Reassure her.

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:13.800
In newspapers, she reads
about pirates, Financial Police…

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.480
-She worries.
-How many times do we have to tell you?

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:19.200
It's okay. There's no need to worry.
There is no…

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.080
Angelo, will you tell Dad
everything's okay?

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:24.360
I'll go get water for the kids.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.000
One Financial Police captain
wants to bust our balls.

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.760
But he can't because we're smarter.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.640
-Yes, but--
-You're not the aunt from last time.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:34.440
-You're a new aunt.
-What are you talking about, honey?

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.640
-Damn, sometimes those kids…
-Yes.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.200
Let's go get a drink.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.520
The kids are always with their mother.

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:44.400
They never see their father,
and they live in their own fantasy world.

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:48.040
Gorgeous! Oh my God, she's gorgeous!

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:51.800
I think she's got your eyes.
They look like they're turning blue.

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:53.760
She's got your mouth too.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:57.680
No, we think that she's got
Grandpa Gaetano's mouth.

01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.480
In short, she looks nothing like Enrico.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.760
You know what she's got from Enrico?
The look.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.920
As if she was always searching
for something.

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.720
Let me ask you a question.
In your opinion…

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.160
Peppì, you'll talk after me. Don't worry.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.000
How old is the man in the painting?

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:17.280
No, you can't ask like that.
You're directing their answer.

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.360
-Why? I asked--
-You asked how old…

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:23.680
-I mean, the question was okay…
-So, why are you saying that…

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.280
In short, everything is clear.
The picture is complete.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:31.200
But this only concerns
the Anglo-Saxon market.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:35.480
In Italy, which is the scenario
we are most interested in,

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:40.000
the situation has catastrophic features,
to say the least.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.200
-What are we talking about?
-Piracy.

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.200
-That's terrible.
-Yeah.

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.320
A real plague.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.960
So, to start off, we took an example
that we consider emblematic.

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.720
These are the sales
divided by record company.

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.560
For reasons of sensitivity,
names are not visible.

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:58.240
But there's one I do want to show you.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:05.160
The biggest column of all by far
belongs to a label called Mixed by Erry.

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.080
-And they are pirates.
-Pirates?

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:12.920
With 27% of the market,
they are the leading Italian label

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:18.320
with peaks of 85% in southern Italy,
where Mixed by Erry is seen as original

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.960
because it's, in turn, pirated.

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.280
-This is absurd!
-What a shame!

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.480
-Unbelievable.
-This is outrageous.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000
These are the sales for the top records
of each Italian record label.

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:34.160
And this is currently the best-selling
Mixed by Erry tape.

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.320
The Sanremo compilation,

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:39.920
which is already on the market stalls
while the festival is still on.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.800
-How do they do it?
-We don't know.

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.240
They must have a mole inside RAI.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.320
-Exactly.
-Maybe, but we're not sure.

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:47.720
Or inside Sanremo itself.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.160
These figures do represent an emergency,

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.480
and they have been shown
to the institutions.

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.960
The Ministry of the Interior
has indeed allocated special funds,

01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:00.200
which are available immediately,
aimed at a zero-tolerance policy…

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.160
Fuck! Where are you?

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.680
Hey!

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:22.000
-Going home or to the office, sir?
-We're going to Naples. Go!

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:25.160
And fast.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.800
<i>Suddenly, everything changed.</i>

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:30.040
<i>The record labels made themselves heard.</i>
<i>The Financial Police took action.</i>

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:34.040
<i>They revolutionized the force</i>
<i>by prioritizing the fight against piracy.</i>

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.240
<i>In charge of the new division,</i>

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:40.520
<i>they put the one</i>
<i>who'd done the most reporting and raiding.</i>

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:41.840
<i>Guess who that was?</i>

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:50.040
We're done.
Thank you all, and see you soon.

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.960
Arturo! What are you doing here?

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.360
I came back from Milan to see you.
We need to talk right away.

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:03.000
-You couldn't call?
-No, forget the phone.

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:06.200
Let's talk.
Am I free to speak, or is someone here?

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.840
-No. I was actually going out--
-Enrico, listen to me carefully.

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:13.760
The meeting I went to this morning,
everyone was pissed off!

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.200
Calm down. What?

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.880
The record labels
know everything about you,

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.720
and they want to shut you down.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.400
You are the leading record label in Italy.

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.520
They've spoken to the government,
allocated a lot of money.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:28.480
They want to arrest you.
Do you understand or not?

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.640
Are we really
the leading record label in Italy?

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.680
Yes, but apart from that,
did you hear what I said?

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.240
They're keeping tabs on your phones.

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.280
Also, what's this thing about you having
Sanremo songs before the others?

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:48.320
That drove them mad. How do you do it?

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.080
Actually, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.760
That's it now.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.280
Shut it all down. It's over.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:59.680
I mean, the money you've made
all these years

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.800
will last you
the next three generations anyway.

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:06.400
Arturo, do you really think
this is about money?

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.200
Enrico, there's very little time left.
Your days are numbered.

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:15.640
Among other things,
there's this new super hi-tech stuff

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.040
that will catch on.

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:18.720
It's called a compact disc.

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.120
It's a disc that's read by a laser beam.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.520
It's sci-fi stuff.

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:25.400
I didn't understand
a fucking thing about it.

01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:28.400
But it is digital. You can't copy it.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:30.680
Enrico.

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:35.840
Stop while you still can.
I'm telling you this as a friend.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.520
And, as a friend, I thank you.

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:44.720
But music, you can play it,
reproduce it, even digitize it,

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.240
but you can never stop it.

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:51.360
I have to run now.
I have a very important appointment.

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.480
I'll talk to you on the phone, okay?

01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.040
Right.

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.800
Good evening, Don Gaetano. Hey.

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.240
-Has he called yet?
-No, not yet.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.280
So this thing gets read
by a laser beam? My God!

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.800
Peppì, it's not the lightsaber
from <i>Star Wars</i>.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:20.320
It's a beam of light on polycarbonate
that reflects off an optical sensor.

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.600
If it reflects a lot, it's one.
If it reflects little, it's zero.

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.400
It's called "digital."

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.760
Look, Barambani came to see me.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.240
What did he want?

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:33.000
He said we're the leading record label
in Italy.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.440
-Really?
-Yes.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.760
It's for me, Don Gaetano.

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.480
-Hello?
-Peppe!

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:48.280
<i>-Angiolé!</i>
-Peppe, can you hear me?

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:49.400
<i>I just hear noise.</i>

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:51.960
You have no idea
how good the food is here.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:55.160
They make delicious spaghetti,
almost transparent.

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:58.600
Besides the food, they're super advanced.
Things don't cost shit.

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:02.080
You'll tell me about the food later.
Have you found what we need?

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:04.160
Yes, I told you they're super advanced.

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.520
They have a device here called…

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.320
-What's it called?
-CLC.

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.160
CLC. Something like that.

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.920
Put a bit of that dark sauce.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.600
This device copies CDs
at a professional level.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.440
-And they can also give us the blank CDs.
<i>-Great.</i>

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.760
Buy a dozen, get on a boat, and come back.

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:22.600
-Sanremo is in a fortnight.
<i>-All right.</i>

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.880
So? Everything okay?

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:30.360
All fine, Erry.
I told you, no one can stop us.

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:45.840
What are you doing?

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.080
A red herring.

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:58.560
Honey? Yes, it's me.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.320
I was thinking,
to celebrate our anniversary,

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.720
since we've always watched it from home,

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.960
why don't we go
and watch Sanremo live this year?

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.400
Yes, let's go.

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:11.040
Me, you,

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:16.800
Peppino, my brother, Peppe Frattasio,
with Francesca, his wife.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:19.840
<i>Angelo, my brother.</i>

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.920
<i>Not Peppe.</i>
<i>The other one, Angelo Frattasio.</i>

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.520
<i>-Are you okay? You're talking weirdly.</i>
<i>-I'm talking normally.</i>

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.360
<i>We can all go there and get a nice hotel.</i>

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:32.160
<i>There in Sanremo,</i>
<i>really close to the Ariston Theatre…</i>

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.680
ARISTON
41ST FESTIVAL OF THE ITALIAN SONG

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.960
FEBRUARY 27-28, MARCH 1-2 1991, 8:00 PM

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.840
The package has been delivered.

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.560
<i>I repeat, the package has been delivered.</i>

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:14.600
The Frattasios have arrived.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.920
We are not leaving this place

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.960
until we've found out who the mole
inside the Sanremo Festival is.

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.840
Let's trigger Operation Mike

01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:25.520
and send the Frattasios to jail
once and for all!

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:27.920
-The San Carlo is nicer.
-Teresa, you're right.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.040
As if she knows what it looks like!

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.200
-I do know!
-Have you ever been there?

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.600
Yes! Why…

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.360
Let's go, guys. It's getting late.

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:38.720
Go ahead.

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.600
-Where are you going?
-I'll catch up.

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:56.000
<i>Enrico Frattasio</i>
<i>is approaching a public telephone.</i>

01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:58.960
He's calling the mole!
Come on. Let's get on the phones.

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:01.960
Which phone is he calling from?

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:06.000
<i>From a pay phone in the foyer.</i>

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:10.960
What the fuck? There are four of them.
I need the exact one to intercept him.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.160
He's talking to someone.

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:17.320
I can't intercept the call
if I don't know the exact phone!

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.320
If he ends the call,
I'll come and kick your butt!

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.680
<i>It should be the first one</i>
<i>on the mezzanine floor.</i>

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:24.160
Right, who's on the mezzanine floor?

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:27.760
What do you mean "it should"?
Is it the one or not?

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:30.800
-That's the one. We're connecting now.
-Quick! Hurry up!

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.840
Check if the fucking number is right!

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.360
See if it's on the list.

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:37.920
<i>They've just announced the start</i>
<i>of the night. They're inviting people in.</i>

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.720
How long does it fucking take
to intercept a call?

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.520
We're locating it. He's calling Naples.

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:46.880
So what if he's calling Naples?
A million people live there.

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.920
-I need to know who he's talking to.
<i>-Enrico's still on the phone.</i>

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.040
<i>I don't think for much longer.</i>

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.880
We have the address. 181 Zite Street.

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:58.560
Come on! 181 Zite Street!
Let's send a patrol immediately!

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:00.480
Go on, send two of them!

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:04.240
-I got it. We have the connection.
-Great. Zite Street…

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:07.480
181.

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:10.240
He's talking to a woman.

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.680
You said 181 Zite Street?

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.880
Yes. He's talking to a woman.

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.280
He's talking to his mother.

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:34.640
I confirm, Captain. He's wishing
his mother a good Sanremo Festival.

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:35.960
It's his mother's house.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:58.040
PREMIUM SEATS

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.200
Hey. Let me through.

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.360
Erry, what a pain!

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:14.920
Good evening!

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.360
-Edwige Fenech!
-Andrea Occhipinti!

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:18.400
What's wrong, Erry?

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.560
Dear ladies…

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.840
Dear gentlemen…

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:30.640
-Happy anniversary.
-The 41st Sanremo Festival starts now!

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:32.440
Thank you!

01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:00.840
We seized these an hour ago.

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:02.960
They're all Sanremo compilations.

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:07.960
-But it's two o'clock in the afternoon.
-Things are bound to get worse.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.920
Fucking Frattasios!
How the fuck do they do it?

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.760
-Actually, there's something worse.
-Even worse?

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.640
Now they're copying CDs as well.

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:33.760
Captain!

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.560
-Someone wants to see you.
-Who gives a shit?

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:41.200
Can't you see the mess we're in?
For all these tapes, we need an inventory.

01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:44.240
How many discs and cartons have we seized?

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.480
It's about Mixed by Erry.

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:08.560
So it's 250 million in Calabria
and 200 million in Sicily.

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:11.960
So that makes about two billion
with Sanremo only.

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:15.160
And it's only four days.
We'll triple our revenues with CDs.

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:18.840
Sanremo was full of undercover agents.
They'll be mad as hell now.

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:21.720
If they get pissed off,
that's their problem, not ours.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.160
What can we do if they took it personally?

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:26.400
So, Dad? What do you say?

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:30.800
<i>…Schillaci narrowly misses the touch.</i>
<i>It's the seventh attempt…</i>

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.960
I need to be in Piazza Garibaldi by 5:30.
The train is coming from Milan.

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.120
This is the good one.

01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:37.800
It's Sunday, Dad. Why do you go?

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:40.240
This weekend alone,
we've made two billion.

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:43.160
Why do you insist on living in this house

01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:45.480
and selling fake whiskey
in Piazza Garibaldi?

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.400
Come and give me a hand.

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.360
Guys!

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.760
-Hurry up, guys. It's late.
-Yes.

01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:56.960
Hurry up!

01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:58.080
Erry, brush it.

01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.360
-If you don't iron it first, how can I?
-What? Just brush it!

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.440
Wait.

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:05.920
Dad, the tea is always the same!
You can't every time…

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.240
Don't answer back!

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.800
-I won't--
-Don't answer back!

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:12.080
-I get it. I won't…
-Add more water and shut up!

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:13.440
I won't answer back!

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:16.160
You need to add water.

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:19.320
-That's enough!
-I don't get it. What's changed, Dad?

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.520
<i>Arturo Maria Barambani</i>
<i>bargained for immunity</i>

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.480
<i>in exchange for information about us.</i>

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.560
<i>And he had a lot.</i>

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:25.240
<i>From the holding company system</i>

<i>Even staff management,</i>

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.160
Frattasio.

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:55.680
Frattasio!

01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:58.680
There's a package for you from your wife.

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:00.320
Yes.

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:06.560
A suit for the trial.

01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.160
Thank you.

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:40.440
<i>So, Erry, it's very simple.</i>

01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:44.320
This is just the first hearing,
and they have absolutely nothing on you.

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.080
So we'll deny everything.

01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:48.720
The tapes, the piracy…
We know nothing about that!

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:56.480
Do you know anyone who knows
the terms of the Maastricht Treaty?

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:57.720
What do you mean, Erry?

01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.360
Do you know what they're deciding?

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:03.040
Please, Erry. You have to focus.

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:06.040
We won't have to say anything in court.

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:10.000
When the judge calls us
and asks us how we plead,

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.960
we will only say one word, okay?

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.080
"Innocent."

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:16.720
Erry? Do you understand me or not?

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:20.760
Yes, I understand. We plead innocent.

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:28.240
I am innocent.

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:32.560
<i>Let's start.</i>

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:37.800
The Italian State vs. Giuseppe Frattasio,
Angelo Frattasio, and Enrico Frattasio.

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:40.960
The defendants are charged
with criminal conspiracy

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:42.840
in various aspects,

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:46.960
which include counterfeiting, possession,

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:50.440
and smuggling of music tapes
and compact discs.

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.000
All thanks to the ownership
of means, premises, and equipment

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:58.040
for the reproduction and duplication

01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:02.880
of ultra-professional
phonographic material.

01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:05.880
Defendant Enrico Frattasio.

01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:12.960
How do you plead?

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:27.880
Frattasio, how do you plead?
Guilty or innocent?

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:29.400
Erry?

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:31.760
Erry?

01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:34.320
Erry?

01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:55.640
I…

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:05.520
<i>I am a DJ.</i>

01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:13.640
ENRICO, PEPPE AND ANGELO WERE SENTENCED
TO 4 YEARS AND 6 MONTHS IN PRISON.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.680
ALL THEIR ASSETS WERE CONFISCATED.

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:19.800
AFTER THE "MIXED BY ERRY" AFFAIR, THE FPM
(FEDERATION AGAINST MUSIC PIRACY)

01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:23.160
WAS FOUNDED IN ITALY TO PROTECT COPYRIGHT
AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:27.000
TODAY ENRICO FRATTASIO
MAKES AND DISTRIBUTES GIFT BOXES.

01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:31.320
OCCASIONALLY HE CONTINUES TO PERFORM
AS A DJ.

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:40.200
THE FRATTASIO BROTHERS DUPLICATED
MORE THAN 180 MILLION TAPES.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.960
Erry, let me understand.
Nothing I do is good.

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:45.520
I had someone take the money…

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.840
I won't shout. I had it buried.

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:51.480
They built tennis courts above it
so no one can move it.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:53.960
In ten years, the concession expires,
and we'll take it.

01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:56.200
But we don't give a damn about tennis.

01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:59.520
We go there, we dig,
and we take back the 30 billion.

01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:02.160
-What's the problem?
-I'll tell you!

01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.560
This is the problem! Look!

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:09.400
THE MAASTRICHT TREATY HAS BEEN SIGNED

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:12.160
THE EURO WILL REPLACE THE CURRENCIES
OF THE 12 MEMBER COUNTRIES

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.240
Erry, that's not a problem.

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.840
They write bullshit.

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:20.320
Do you think
they can change currency overnight?

01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.760
-I think it's bullshit too.
-See?

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:25.680
What? Guys, did you read it?

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:29.400
-You believe everything?
-They release a new model, like cars?

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:30.720
We won't be able to do anything?

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:32.720
At a coffee shop,
"Oh no, I have the old money!"

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:34.160
What coffee shop?

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:54.480
BASED ON THE TRUE STORY
OF ENRICO, GIUSEPPE AND ANGELO FRATTASIO,

01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:56.320
FREELY NARRATED BY THE FILM AUTHORS

01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:16.120
Hello? It's me. Is everything okay?

01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:20.120
-<i>Do you remember what you have to do?</i>
-Of course I do. It's like last year.

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:22.760
I have to press two buttons, that's all.

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:24.200
<i>Enjoy Sanremo then, Mom.</i>

01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:26.240
All right, you too. Have fun.

01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:27.560
Please, be careful.

01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.600
<i>-Yes. Sure.</i>
-Bye.

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:34.360
<i>…of their friend Silvano,</i>
<i>who naturally went…</i>

01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:38.720
-What did he say?
-Nothing. All three of them are there.

01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:42.720
I don't understand why they went there,
in that cold weather…

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:46.320
There's nothing we can do.
They're daft. Don't worry about it.

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:53.840
-Oh God, it's starting! Wait!
<i>-…the 41st Sanremo Festival!</i>

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:56.440
What was it? "Rec" and "play."

01:47:58.960 --> 01:47:59.800
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:04.080
Marisa, this is the last year
we go through this hassle.

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.880
I'm sick of having this huge mess.

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:08.600
Yeah, enough. Too much dust.

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:10.480
<i>This event every year…</i>

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:04.320
