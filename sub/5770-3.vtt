00:07.311 --> 00:08.791
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

00:08.834 --> 00:10.706
SO YOU FOUND
THE TAPE OF ME?

00:10.749 --> 00:12.099
WELL, WELL, WELL.

00:12.142 --> 00:13.709
LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS
DO CHECK YOUR EMAILS.

00:13.752 --> 00:14.884
YOU ARE BUSTED!

00:14.927 --> 00:16.625
I SENT YOU AN EMAIL LATE SATURDAY NIGHT

00:16.668 --> 00:18.627
WITH A SUBJECT HEADING,
"ANSWER A.S.A.P."

00:18.670 --> 00:20.194
DIDN'T HEAR
FROM EITHER OF YOU.

00:20.237 --> 00:22.326
GUYS, I NEED
TO BOOK THOSE ROOMS

00:22.370 --> 00:23.501
FOR OUR CONFERENCE
IN SANTA FE.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.329
JUST UPGRADE
TO THE MESA VIEW ROOMS.

00:25.373 --> 00:27.157
IT'S 49 BUCKS,
JUST DO IT.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.203
I'M SORRY
I'M NOT A MIND READER.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.421
MINDY, IT WAS
SATURDAY NIGHT.

00:30.465 --> 00:32.336
I WAS OTHERWISE
OCCUPIED.YEAH, WE GET IT.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.729
YOU WERE HOOKING UP
WITH A SUPERMODEL.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.687
I WOULD HARDLY CALL THIS GIRL
A SUPERMODEL.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.776
I THINK YOU NEED TO BE BOOKING
DOMESTIC COVERS

00:37.820 --> 00:39.300
BEFORE YOU CALL YOURSELF
A SUPERMODEL.

00:39.343 --> 00:41.084
OKAY, DANNY,
WHAT WAS YOUR EXCUSE?

00:41.128 --> 00:42.781
SITTIN' ON YOUR STOOP,
PLAYING A HARMONICA?

00:42.825 --> 00:45.262
I LIKE TO SCHEDULE C-SECTIONS
FOR SATURDAY NIGHTS.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.481
HOSPITAL'S QUIET.

00:46.524 --> 00:47.917
IT'S REALLY GREAT,
DESOLATE.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.397
YOUR WEEKEND SOUNDED
REALLY DEPRESSING,

00:49.440 --> 00:51.051
AND YOUR WEEKEND
SOUNDED DISGUSTING.

00:51.094 --> 00:53.053
ACTUALLY, I HAD
A GREAT WEEKEND.SHE WASN'T A SUPERMODEL.

00:53.096 --> 00:54.793
I HAD A GREAT TIME.BUT SHE WAS, YOU KNOW,
SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.056
NO, YOU GUYS
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.058
BOTH OF THOSE WEEKENDS
SOUND BETTER THAN MINE.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.538
I FELL ASLEEP
WATCHING THE MOVIE AMELIE.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.018
AND WHEN I WOKE UP,

01:02.062 --> 01:03.541
I HAD SPILLED SO MUCH RED WINE
ON MYSELF

01:03.585 --> 01:05.239
THAT I THOUGHT FOR A SECOND
I HAD BEEN SHOT.

01:05.282 --> 01:07.197
OOH.HEY, AT LEAST
YOU'RE HAVING FUN.

01:07.241 --> 01:08.503
THAT'S ALL THAT COUNTS.

01:08.546 --> 01:11.723
HEY, DR. L, MRS. OLSEN

01:11.767 --> 01:14.552

01:18.513 --> 01:20.906

01:23.605 --> 01:25.259
DRAKE SHOWED UP

01:25.302 --> 01:26.390

01:26.434 --> 01:27.826

GUYS WHO SEEM LIKE THEY MIGHT
BE EMPLOYED AND STUFF?

02:05.342 --> 02:06.517
[scoffs]
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.824
MAKES CLUB ARIA
LOOK LIKE THUNDER BAR.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.173
UGH, THUNDER BAR?

02:10.217 --> 02:11.435
KILL ME.
AM I RIGHT?

02:11.479 --> 02:12.697
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.525
NO.

02:14.569 --> 02:17.659
THUNDER BAR CAN BE FUN.YEAH.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.924
SHAUNA, YOU HAVE TO TAKE ME
CLUBBING WITH YOU THIS WEEKEND.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.404
I DON'T KNOW, DR. L.

02:23.447 --> 02:26.363
I MEAN, IS NIGHTCLUB STUFF
STILL INTERESTING TO YOU?

02:26.407 --> 02:27.582
YEAH.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.323
LOOK, I MIGHT BE IN MY 30s
IN DOCTORS' YEARS,

02:29.366 --> 02:31.063
BUT I'M, LIKE,
22 IN CLUB YEARS.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.413
I DON'T KNOW, DOC.ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

02:32.456 --> 02:35.024
GIVE THIS TO ME,
AND I WILL LET YOU

02:35.067 --> 02:39.463
SWITCH YOUR DESK
AWAY FROM THE AIR VENT.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.117
HEY, CARLO,
IT'S SHAUNA.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.815
I NEED TO ADD A PLUS ONE
AT THE CLUB ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.122
IT'S MY BOSS,
SORT OF A MAKE-A-WISH THING.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.211
CIAO.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.170
SHAUNA, ARE YOU GOING TO A CLUB
WITH DR. L?

02:50.213 --> 02:51.345
OH, YOU CAN'T COME, MORGAN.

02:51.388 --> 02:52.563
LOOK, YOU NEED ME
TO COME.MM-MM.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.217
I HAVE
THESE AMAZING PILLS.OH, GOD.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.610
HOLD ON.

02:55.653 --> 02:56.872
IF YOU PUT ONE
IN YOUR DRINK,

02:56.915 --> 02:58.526
IT COUNTERACTS
THE EFFECT OF A ROOFIE.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.919
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS,
IF YOU'RE NOT ALREADY ROOFIED,

03:00.963 --> 03:03.357
THE PILLS HAVE VERY ROOFIE-LIKE
SIDE EFFECTS.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.228
SO BASICALLY,
YOUR PILL'S A ROOFIE.NO!

03:05.272 --> 03:07.143
WHY DOES EVERYONE
SAY THAT?

03:07.187 --> 03:10.320
IT ROOFIES THE ROOFIE.

03:10.364 --> 03:13.280
OKAY, CURTIS EXPLAINS THIS
MUCH BETTER THAN ME.

03:13.323 --> 03:14.759
HEY, GOOD NEWS.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.761
I GOT INVITED TO THIS SUPER HOT
NIGHTCLUB FRIDAY NIGHT.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.241
OOH, I'M SO JEALOUS.

03:18.285 --> 03:19.460
WHY?
COME WITH ME.

03:19.503 --> 03:20.896
I'D RATHER DIE.WHAT?

03:20.939 --> 03:22.376
[Gwen]
I CAN'T DO CLUBS ANYMORE.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.073
THEY MAKE ME FEEL JUDGED
AND REJECTED

03:24.116 --> 03:26.293
BY PEOPLE THAT I WOULD NORMALLY
JUDGE AND REJECT.

03:26.336 --> 03:27.903
PLUS, THEY'RE SO CROWDED
AND LOUD.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.252
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A NIGHTCLUB
IN OVER A DECADE,

03:29.296 --> 03:30.340
AND I'VE NEVER GONE
WITHOUT YOU.

03:30.384 --> 03:31.646
WELL, I CAN'T GO ANYWAY

03:31.689 --> 03:32.995
BECAUSE CARL IS TELLING
STORIES AND FOLKTALES

03:33.038 --> 03:34.692
AT THE LIBRARY
ABOUT OUR TOWN'S HISTORY.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.738
[whispering]
AND I PERSONALLY HATE IT.

03:36.781 --> 03:39.262
BUT IT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL,
SO I'M VERY PROUD OF HIM.

03:39.306 --> 03:40.394
ALL RIGHT,
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

03:40.437 --> 03:41.917
IN THIS CONVERSATION.
LOVE YOU, BYE.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.658
HAVE FUN. YOU TOO.

03:43.701 --> 03:46.400
MINDY, ARE YOU COMING
TO OFFICE CLUB NIGHT?

03:46.443 --> 03:48.271
COULD I GIVE YOU A FEW THINGS
TO KEEP IN YOUR PURSE?

03:48.315 --> 03:49.925
I LIKE TO KEEP
A TRIM PROFILE.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.970
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT OUR CLUB NIGHT?

03:52.014 --> 03:53.581
SHAUNA?SORRY, DOC.

03:53.624 --> 03:56.148

03:56.192 --> 03:58.194
I ORDERED A NEW DRESS.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.717
MOM SAYS SHE'S ALMOST DONE
SEWING THE SLEEVES.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.241
BETSY'S COMING TOO? YEAH.

04:01.284 --> 04:03.330
DR. C, YOU IN

04:03.373 --> 04:05.375
NOT THIS TIME.
YOU GUYS HAVE FUN.

04:05.419 --> 04:06.637
[chuckles]

04:06.681 --> 04:07.986
OKAY, WHAT'S THAT?

04:08.030 --> 04:09.031
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

04:09.074 --> 04:10.815
NO, IT--
IT'S JUST FUNNY TO ME.

04:10.859 --> 04:13.296
WHAT IS?PICTURING YOU
AT A NIGHTCLUB.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.167
YOU KNOW?
IT'S WEIRD.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.430
IT'S LIKE DRACULA
ON A BEACH.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.519
WHAT?
I GO OUT.OKAY.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.738
I DO.

04:20.782 --> 04:21.826
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M IN.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.350
MY GRANDMA HAD THIS SAYING,

04:23.393 --> 04:25.308
"YOU WORK HARD,
YOU PLAY HARD."YEP.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.570
YOUR GRANDMOTHER
COINED THE PHRASE,

04:26.614 --> 04:28.268
"WORK HARD, PLAY HARD"? I KNOW, RIGHT?

04:28.311 --> 04:31.183
NEVER FINISHED
THE THIRD GRADE.

04:31.227 --> 04:32.315
CLUB NIGHT.YES!

04:32.359 --> 04:34.230
COME ON, RIGHT THERE.WHOO!

04:51.595 --> 04:53.075
SHAUNA, IS THAT TIBETAN?

04:53.118 --> 04:55.120
NO, THIS USED TO BE
A MANHATTAN TRUST BANK.

04:55.164 --> 04:57.035
A COUPLE OF THE SIGN LETTERS
FELL OFF.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.254
IT'S GREAT THOUGH.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.125
NBA PLAYERS HANG OUT HERE

05:00.169 --> 05:01.649
ARE YOU SERIOUS?YEAH.

05:01.692 --> 05:02.824

'CAUSE BLACK GUYS LOVE ME.

05:06.436 --> 05:07.568

05:07.611 --> 05:09.570
KEEP YOUR RACISM VOICE DOWN.
SORRY.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.093
THAT'S NOT RACIST.

05:11.136 --> 05:14.096
IT'S A SCIENTIFIC FACT THAT
BLACK GUYS LOVE INDIAN GIRLS.

05:14.139 --> 05:15.619
DON'T--AH.AND,

05:15.663 --> 05:18.100
BLACK GUYS ALSO LOVE ASS,
WHICH I HAPPEN TO HAVE A LOT OF.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.449
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

05:19.493 --> 05:20.885
SO I'M GONNA WORK MY ASS
ALL THE WAY TO THE V.I.P.,

05:20.929 --> 05:22.626
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.THE V.I.P.?

05:22.670 --> 05:24.019
YEAH, GOOD LUCK
WITH THAT.

05:24.062 --> 05:26.151
MORGAN, YOU ARE JOSTLING ME
WITH YOUR DUFFLE.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.675
OH, I'M SORRY, DOC.
I'M SORRY.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.372
I GOT ALL MY CLUB SUPPLIES
IN HERE.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.418
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING'S ORGANIZED.

05:31.461 --> 05:34.595
I GOT THREE DIFFERENT KINDS
OF PRESTIGE FRAGRANCES.

05:34.638 --> 05:37.641
GOT MY SUDOKUS
TO DO DURING BORING SONGS.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.600
AND THEN CHECK THIS OUT
MINDY, MINDY.

05:39.643 --> 05:42.211
MOST IMPORTANTLY,
AN EGGBEATER,

05:42.254 --> 05:44.822
SO IN THE MORNING,
I CAN MAKE HER AN OMELET.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.171
OKAY, GUYS,
JUST LISTEN UP,

05:46.215 --> 05:47.738
SO THERE'S
NO MISUNDERSTANDING.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.045
WHEN KNOW WHAT THE SCORE IS,
RIGHT, WHEN WE GO INTO THE CLUB?

05:50.088 --> 05:52.395
THAT WE ALL HANG OUT
AS FRIENDS FROM WORK.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.831
THIS IS INCORRECT.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.529
SHE'S SAYING THAT
SHE'LL BAIL ON ALL OF YOU

05:55.572 --> 05:58.096
IF SHE MEETS A GUY, RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT, SHAUNA.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.663
IF I DISAPPEAR,
DO NOT FIND ME.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.361
IT MEAN THAT I
AM EITHER FALLING IN LOVE,

06:01.404 --> 06:02.753
OR I'M GRINDING UP
ON SOME GUY,

06:02.797 --> 06:04.102
OR PROBABLY BOTH.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.061
