02:45.391 --> 02:47.559
You want to get hit
in the back of the head?

02:52.558 --> 02:53.851
False shot!

03:01.183 --> 03:04.642
Hey, any of you guys gone down
by the lake? Check out the ice yet?

03:04.766 --> 03:08.976
Oh, yeah. It's gorgeous. Can hit
a slapshot all the way to New York, sir.

03:09.808 --> 03:11.625
That'd be a hell of a shot.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.708
- Yeah, it is 40 clicks to the other side.
- Yeah.

03:14.808 --> 03:16.875
Okay, guys. Enough chitchat, all right?

03:16.975 --> 03:20.267
Let's get focused for tonight's game.
We've got to break this losing streak.

03:53.308 --> 03:55.458
They can't pull that crap in our barn.

03:55.558 --> 03:56.642
Hey!

03:56.933 --> 03:58.541
Yeah, that's right. Come on, get up!

03:58.641 --> 04:00.708
- Rudy, throw down the mitts!
- Come on, Rudy!

04:00.808 --> 04:02.416
Hey, you want to go, boy? Want to go?

04:02.516 --> 04:05.184
Yeah? Back off, pussy,
or I'll tear your goddamn head off!

04:07.808 --> 04:09.708
Keep threatening it, then go.

04:09.808 --> 04:11.625
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

04:11.725 --> 04:14.517
You want to bring that up right now?
You want me to...

04:24.933 --> 04:27.267
You can't show these guys any weakness.

04:27.391 --> 04:29.708
- You look shaky. Get your head in the game.
- No, I'm good.

04:29.808 --> 04:30.833
- You're good?
- Yeah!

04:30.933 --> 04:32.309
Look, we got these guys.
Just stay focused.

04:32.433 --> 04:35.351
I'm good, okay? I'm good! Go! I'm good.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.351
Come on, this is hockey,
not synchronized swimming!

04:39.475 --> 04:40.541
Give it a rest, Mario.

04:40.641 --> 04:42.976
Come on, you guys. Fists, not finesse.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.392
Fists, not finesse.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.351
Sit down. Watch your brother.

04:48.891 --> 04:51.976
So sad, you know? I'll never be
half the man your mother is.

05:05.933 --> 05:07.749
You just quit?

05:07.849 --> 05:12.124
I don't even know when or why. I'm sure
that I probably had something to do with it,

05:12.224 --> 05:15.975
but everything that we believed in,
everything that we put our hopes on,

05:16.099 --> 05:17.934
you just quit on it.

05:18.433 --> 05:20.666
You just talk.
You're down here at the rink,

05:20.766 --> 05:22.684
like... you're, like,
one of these losers down here.

05:22.808 --> 05:25.767
That's what you think of me? A loser?

05:42.308 --> 05:44.142
Yeah!

05:48.308 --> 05:49.517
Yeah!

05:59.641 --> 06:01.791
Goddamn! Was that ugly or what?

06:01.891 --> 06:04.642
- Ugly? That was haggard.
- Hey, a goal's a goal, man.

06:05.974 --> 06:08.725
- Hey, catch my banner, bro?
- How much you pay for that?

06:09.224 --> 06:10.559
I paid them with this.

06:10.849 --> 06:12.350
Come on. We can take them.

06:13.141 --> 06:15.517
Hey, we're up by one.

06:34.641 --> 06:36.874
I always saw something better
for us, Jess.

06:36.974 --> 06:40.309
And there was a time when you said that,
and I actually believed you.

06:41.349 --> 06:44.749
You need to be home.
Casey needs his father.

06:44.849 --> 06:49.517
Yeah. It's hard to keep down a kid
like that. At least we got that part right.

06:50.641 --> 06:51.767
I got to go.

06:52.141 --> 06:53.749
This one's on you, Jess.

06:53.849 --> 06:55.975
And you know, it's pretty obvious
that you've had a few,

06:56.183 --> 06:58.208
so I don't know, maybe you want
to stay sober, right?

06:58.308 --> 07:01.041
'Cause your kid might actually
need you tonight.

07:01.141 --> 07:03.434
This is what you want, right?

07:26.391 --> 07:27.475
What's going on?

07:48.349 --> 07:51.809
Shitty break, Case. You get a pad
on that, and we take them to O.T.

07:51.933 --> 07:53.850
Winners don't wait for breaks.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.142
They make them.

08:01.974 --> 08:04.267
- Casey!
- Demas!

08:05.974 --> 08:08.583
Casey! Casey, are you good?

08:08.683 --> 08:10.975
- Casey?
- I'm fine.

08:11.099 --> 08:13.041
- Good. Can you move?
- Yeah.

08:13.141 --> 08:15.416
- All right.
- If I can stand up.

08:15.516 --> 08:17.142
There you go.

08:17.641 --> 08:18.684
I'm good.

08:18.808 --> 08:20.225
Rudy, come here!

08:21.224 --> 08:25.017
Are you going to let these guys just cruise
out of town, thinking they own this ice?

08:39.807 --> 08:43.058
Did anyone think to call
an ambulance or something?

08:43.849 --> 08:46.433
That's all right.
He just took a little knock.

08:46.724 --> 08:48.582
That's a lot of blood for a knock,
don't you think?

08:48.682 --> 08:52.267
Well, there's more blood vessels
in the head, so it tends to bleed more.

08:57.349 --> 08:58.542
Now that's hockey.

09:03.016 --> 09:06.517
I tell you, without skateboards and hockey,
I'd be put out of business.

09:06.641 --> 09:09.475
- How's it look?
- It looks all right.

09:09.599 --> 09:11.350
You are the best.

09:11.474 --> 09:15.142
Thanks. Unfortunately,
tonight is my last rotation.

09:15.266 --> 09:17.124
Dr. Pradeesh takes over tomorrow.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.058
You're leaving? Is Timsbury
a little bit too exciting for you?

09:20.474 --> 09:24.541
Well, as good as I am at sutures,
I actually trained in neurology.

09:24.641 --> 09:27.541
And I've got an opportunity
to go join a practice in Syracuse.

09:27.641 --> 09:28.975
In the States?

09:29.099 --> 09:32.017
Casey? I came as fast as I could.

09:32.141 --> 09:36.142
- Let me see. Are you okay?
- Be careful. Is Dad coming?

09:36.307 --> 09:37.957
I don't know.
I don't know where your dad is.

09:38.057 --> 09:41.183
What about concussions?
You hear all this stuff about concussions.

09:41.307 --> 09:44.517
- He took a knock, but he checks out fine.
- Is it going to leave a scar?

09:44.641 --> 09:47.350
No. In a couple of months,
you won't even see it.

09:47.557 --> 09:50.291
- Casey, that is it for you for hockey.
- Mom...

09:50.391 --> 09:53.725
No. Every time you get hurt,
it reminds me of when your dad played.

09:54.724 --> 09:57.082
- You're good to go.
- Thank you.

09:57.182 --> 09:58.874
Thanks, David. Get your stuff.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.933
Let's go. There's a whole crowd
of people out there waiting for you.

10:07.224 --> 10:09.541
- Hey! There he is.
- There's the stud. How you doing, buddy?

10:09.641 --> 10:11.041
- You dizzy or what?
- I'm okay.

10:11.141 --> 10:13.183
- You good?
- Stitches.

10:13.307 --> 10:16.142
- Seven.
- Whatever. You look badass.

10:16.266 --> 10:18.100
Yeah, it's pretty sexy.

10:18.682 --> 10:19.850
Dissolvable sutures, doc?

10:19.974 --> 10:22.975
Yup. They should absorb in a week or so.

10:23.099 --> 10:26.667
- So, no internal stitches?
- What year of medical school are you in?

10:27.057 --> 10:29.267
I think we'd all like to know.

10:29.766 --> 10:31.183
See you, buddy.

10:32.474 --> 10:35.225
Hey, Scarface? We're all headed down
to Pinheads. You want to come?

10:35.516 --> 10:37.457
Not tonight, boys. Let's go.

10:37.557 --> 10:41.475
- Bye, Mrs. D. Love you.
- "It's bedtime for Casey."

11:01.099 --> 11:02.791
You sure you're okay?

11:02.891 --> 11:04.582
Yeah, Mom, I'm fine.

11:04.682 --> 11:07.975
- You feel dizzy or nauseous?
- No, I'm fine.

11:09.724 --> 11:13.933
Casey, I need some time
to figure some things out.

11:16.891 --> 11:21.375
Okay. I get it. Everyone needs
a time-out every once in a while.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.267
I'll see you inside.

11:30.224 --> 11:32.308
Can you pop the trunk?
I forgot my knapsack.

11:50.266 --> 11:54.082
I need more than a time-out, Casey.
I need some time away.

11:54.182 --> 11:56.042
I'm just going to be at Aunt Nita's.

11:57.807 --> 12:00.308
Aunt Nita's in Cornwall.
That's an hour from here.

12:00.474 --> 12:04.475
It's not an hour.
It's 20 minutes, 25 minutes.

12:07.682 --> 12:11.040
Okay. I'll just go grab my bags.

12:11.140 --> 12:13.374
No, no. That's not the way
this is going to be.

12:13.474 --> 12:16.183
Honey, you are struggling at school.
That would be a big change.

12:16.307 --> 12:19.040
I don't care about that. I can change.
It's not the end of the world.

12:19.140 --> 12:23.749
I'm sleeping on Aunt Nita's couch as it is.
I'm going to call. I'm going to be around.

12:23.849 --> 12:26.016
You're going to be around?
What does that mean?

12:30.265 --> 12:32.625
Things have changed
between me and your dad.

12:32.932 --> 12:35.141
No, they're exactly the same
they've been for the past year.

12:35.265 --> 12:37.582
Sometimes, people just...

12:37.682 --> 12:39.541
just need some freedom.

12:40.390 --> 12:42.375
Freedom from what?

12:42.807 --> 12:45.100
Not from you.
That's not what I'm saying.

12:46.724 --> 12:50.558
Honey, I love you. I am always going
to be a part of your life. Always.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.540
You're not even coming in, are you?
You're just going to leave it on me to tell him.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.266
He knows.

12:59.765 --> 13:01.600
Believe me, he knows.

13:11.949 --> 13:13.875
Go. I'm happy you're leaving.

13:33.474 --> 13:35.141
Dad?

13:46.974 --> 13:49.624
"Lidstrom on Casey Demas.
Lidstrom for the weak side. He shoots...

13:49.724 --> 13:53.874
"Oh, great stick save by Demas!
And he covers up."

13:53.974 --> 13:58.915
- Pretty far from the real story.
- Yeah, well, next time. Yeah.

13:59.015 --> 14:02.308
Who was it that said,
"Goaltending is like being shot at"?

14:02.974 --> 14:05.290
- Jacques Plante.
- That's right.

14:05.390 --> 14:09.040
Just 'cause you're the goaltender
doesn't mean you're the only one on defense.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.100
How many shots on goal tonight?

14:12.390 --> 14:13.457
30, 35.

14:13.557 --> 14:16.641
35. Nobody's good enough
to stop everything.

14:16.765 --> 14:20.808
You guys got to get back. Keep them
from getting all those open shots on goal.

14:21.682 --> 14:23.641
I got to get this...

14:23.765 --> 14:27.040
All this work done or I'm going
to have hell to pay tomorrow.

14:27.140 --> 14:29.016
I can help.

14:29.432 --> 14:32.624
No. I want you to go inside,
take it easy.

14:32.724 --> 14:36.350
Go ahead. Watch T.V.
You had a rough day.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.766
Mom's gone.

14:44.015 --> 14:45.725
Yeah.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.391
She's just clearing her head.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.850
You...

14:52.265 --> 14:55.308
Still up for going to Belleville?
Check out the ice dogs?

14:56.349 --> 14:57.683
You still want to?

14:58.307 --> 15:00.266
I do if you do.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.641
Is she coming back?

15:08.849 --> 15:11.850
I don't always know
what your mom is thinking.

15:15.849 --> 15:18.808
Okay. What are we going to do about it?
What's the plan?

15:20.307 --> 15:21.975
I don't know yet.

15:23.099 --> 15:25.600
You guys fight all the time.
What happened?

15:26.974 --> 15:28.808
I don't know.

15:29.473 --> 15:33.183
- How are you going to fix it...
- Case! I'm not the one who quit on us.

15:36.807 --> 15:38.266
No.

15:38.557 --> 15:40.849
You pretty much quit on everything else.

16:57.515 --> 16:59.349
Hi, Casey.

17:02.807 --> 17:04.848
One, two, three, stop!

17:04.973 --> 17:06.516
Hey, guys.

17:08.307 --> 17:11.141
So, you ask her if she wants
to ride your zamboni yet?

17:11.848 --> 17:14.516
- Nice.
- She's new here, isn't she?

17:14.640 --> 17:16.766
Yeah, her old man works
with my dad in the warehouse now.

17:16.973 --> 17:20.016
She transferred, like, last month
or something. I don't know.

17:20.223 --> 17:21.641
So, you get her phone number?

17:21.848 --> 17:24.457
I hate to break it to you, bud,
but she's got peanut butter legs.

17:24.557 --> 17:26.473
- What?
- Easy to spread.

17:29.348 --> 17:31.248
- Oh, come on, man!
- What?

17:31.348 --> 17:34.141
Aren't you supposed to be eating
broccoli and egg whites?

17:34.265 --> 17:36.623
You've got that septic tank heart thing.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.808
- They call it...
- Ventricular septal defect.

17:39.932 --> 17:41.707
And I got arteries
like a garden hose, okay?

17:41.807 --> 17:43.123
You're a garden hose.

17:43.223 --> 17:45.099
Check out my M.R.I.'s

17:45.598 --> 17:47.141
- Seriously?
- Here, here.

17:47.265 --> 17:48.349
- See?
- Oh, he actually has it.

17:48.473 --> 17:50.873
Yeah, this one shows the hole
between the chambers in the heart.

17:50.973 --> 17:52.849
You're so weird. Why do you have that?

17:52.973 --> 17:57.266
Rudy, you know all this, dude. He's only
told us about a thousand times before.

17:57.557 --> 17:59.599
Do you know what happens
if the hole doesn't heal itself?

17:59.973 --> 18:01.599
Sudden death!

18:07.723 --> 18:11.308
- It's not as funny as you guys think.
- Man, you get that during the game?

18:13.265 --> 18:16.290
Just forget about it. Soon as I'm done
with school, I'm gone.

18:16.390 --> 18:18.415
You know what? Forget school.
You know why?

18:18.515 --> 18:21.183
Because this guy's going to be playing in
the CHL, sooner or later, so who cares?

18:21.307 --> 18:25.016
Yeah, I'm so sure that some scout's going to
come and scope out a bunch of plugs like us.

18:25.890 --> 18:28.641
- All right, we're bouncing.
- You're putting the tab? Thanks, bro.

18:28.932 --> 18:31.183
- Coming? Hurry up.
- Guys, wait up.

18:32.515 --> 18:34.707
Well, you look better
than the last time I saw you.

18:34.807 --> 18:37.141
- Hi.
- Laid out on the ice.

18:38.473 --> 18:40.724
Yeah. Feeling better. Seven stitches.

18:41.223 --> 18:43.558
So, do you guys
keep score on everything?

18:44.557 --> 18:47.099
Can I have a cream soda, please?

18:47.807 --> 18:49.457
Thank you.

18:49.557 --> 18:52.540
So, I'm guessing with head injuries,
you've got to pay attention.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.808
No dizziness, amnesia.

18:55.098 --> 18:57.290
I wouldn't mind amnesia
every once in a while.

18:57.390 --> 19:00.516
- And what are you trying to forget?
- You ask a lot of questions.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.456
Okay, well...

19:03.556 --> 19:06.141
Maybe you should take it easy. Sleep in.

19:06.431 --> 19:09.557
I'm going to an ice dog skate
with my dad tomorrow morning.

19:10.056 --> 19:11.599
Ice dogs are...?

19:12.640 --> 19:14.141
Juniors.

19:14.640 --> 19:18.016
- Don't know what juniors are.
- Hockey. Sports.

19:18.223 --> 19:21.641
Well, I'm guessing you know
there are other things in life, right?

19:22.015 --> 19:23.974
And you're Canadian.

19:25.890 --> 19:28.099
I know you. You're Casey.

19:29.181 --> 19:31.141
Okay. I know you, too.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.807
- Page Broughton.
- Casey Demas.

19:35.431 --> 19:37.974
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah, it hurts.

19:38.140 --> 19:40.849
The Lidocaine is wearing off, I think.

19:41.473 --> 19:45.206
Anyway, I should... I should...
Yeah, this was nice.

19:45.306 --> 19:46.849
See you around?

19:46.973 --> 19:48.956
- Yeah. Good.
- See ya.

19:49.056 --> 19:50.182
Bye.

19:51.806 --> 19:53.956
Saw on the news last night...

19:54.056 --> 19:56.206
They're thinking,
with all this cold weather,

19:56.306 --> 20:00.081
lake's frozen solid all the way across.
First time since 1934.

20:00.181 --> 20:02.415
What the hell happened
to global warming?

20:02.515 --> 20:05.641
You know, this beauty of a town,
it's always the last to get anything.

20:05.765 --> 20:08.307
This place sucks.
Nothing ever happens here.

20:10.140 --> 20:11.474
They say they're pushing
the ice fishing nuts

20:11.598 --> 20:13.540
further and further
in the lake this year, too.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.790
We could get across the lake.

20:14.890 --> 20:17.290
Is your old man going to let you
take out his precious little cat?

20:17.390 --> 20:20.915
You dumbass. Not with a snowmobile.

20:21.015 --> 20:23.807
- No, I say we skate it.
- Skate it?

20:23.931 --> 20:25.706
The whole lake?
Come on, man. Get serious.

20:25.806 --> 20:27.974
They may say "frozen,"
but not all the way through.

20:28.265 --> 20:30.974
There's still warm currents
and hot spots.

20:31.098 --> 20:35.057
- There's pressure ridges and gas holes.
- I think you're a gas hole.

20:36.473 --> 20:39.307
Seriously, right? Is there anything
you're not an expert at?

20:39.640 --> 20:40.974
Getting you to shut up?

20:41.098 --> 20:42.391
Hey! Hey!

20:44.015 --> 20:47.641
Look, all I'm saying is,
this shit can be unpredictable!

20:48.431 --> 20:52.141
- Has anybody ever done that?
- Done what? Skate to New York?

21:02.265 --> 21:08.057
Dude, nobody in this town does anything
except sit on their ass and watch T.V.

21:08.473 --> 21:10.807
We could be the first.

21:11.181 --> 21:12.915
That would be pretty amazing.

21:13.015 --> 21:16.516
I bet we'd be all over YouTube.
Guinness book of records even.

21:16.723 --> 21:19.974
Oh, man. That'd be baller steezy!

21:20.598 --> 21:22.141
Seriously, though...

21:22.556 --> 21:25.581
No one's going to want to come around
thousand islands crossing to come get us.

21:25.681 --> 21:29.748
No one would have to come get us. I mean,
we could just go there and back, round-trip.

21:29.848 --> 21:31.807
80 clicks?

21:32.598 --> 21:35.057
Yeah. Let's just do it!

21:35.348 --> 21:38.849
You know? Meet here tomorrow morning
at 6:30. Just go.

21:39.140 --> 21:43.206
Hell, we'll pack our bag with extra layers,
and don't forget carbs and hydration.

21:43.306 --> 21:46.540
- We're going to need the energy.
- Wait, so we're actually doing this?

21:46.640 --> 21:47.849
- Yeah!
- Hell yeah, we are!

21:47.949 --> 21:51.074
Why not? What are you guys
going to tell your parents though?

21:51.174 --> 21:53.581
- Rudy, Dad will kill us.
- You've got to lie to them.

21:53.681 --> 21:56.016
You can't tell them what we're going to do.
You know what they're going to say.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.873
Nobody in my house
is going to care anyway. So...

21:58.973 --> 22:00.974
You know what?
Why don't you just sit this one out?

22:01.348 --> 22:04.581
- What do you mean, sit this one out?
- Yeah, Rudy, what's that all about?

22:04.681 --> 22:06.706
All I'm saying is, if you want
to be part of this group,

22:06.806 --> 22:09.706
then maybe you should've played
a little tougher in the net.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.891
Come on, that's bullshit, man.

22:12.306 --> 22:14.641
Get off his back, you monkey.

22:15.015 --> 22:18.123
I'm just messing with him.
I'm messing with you, all right?

22:18.223 --> 22:20.891
Just... maybe you should have
stopped that puck.

22:21.806 --> 22:23.206
Go blow yourself, Bouchard.

22:23.306 --> 22:26.182
Oh, come on. Come on.
It was just a joke. I was kidding!

22:26.306 --> 22:28.640
I'm going to the ice dogs game
with my dad tomorrow anyway.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.289
- Casey, he's just...
- Let him go. Let him go.

22:30.389 --> 22:33.349
- Hey, he's just being Rudy.
- Art, get over here, come on. Let him go.

23:10.098 --> 23:11.349
<i>Hello?</i>

23:11.473 --> 23:14.682
- Hey, Aunt Nita, it's Casey.
- <i>Hi. It's nice to hear your voice.</i>

23:14.806 --> 23:18.974
- Sorry for calling so late.
- <i>Oh, it's okay. Hey, how'd the game go?</i>

23:19.848 --> 23:22.807
We lost, but it was close.

23:24.181 --> 23:25.932
Can I talk to my mom?

23:27.056 --> 23:29.432
<i>She's not here yet.</i>

23:29.639 --> 23:32.474
She's not? Is...

23:32.931 --> 23:34.706
Did she say when she was going
to get there?

23:34.806 --> 23:37.182
<i>No, she didn't say.
Do you have a message for her?</i>

23:37.306 --> 23:39.081
No, no messages.

23:39.181 --> 23:41.182
<i>You okay, Casey?
You sound a little distant.</i>

23:41.306 --> 23:43.640
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good.

23:43.973 --> 23:46.914
<i>Are you sure you don't want
to leave a message?</i>

23:47.014 --> 23:48.932
No, I just...

23:50.098 --> 23:53.474
I just wanted to make sure
she got there okay.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.390
<i>Okay. Good night.</i>

23:56.931 --> 23:58.765
Love you.

24:21.389 --> 24:23.015
Dad?

25:09.931 --> 25:12.414
Whose brilliant idea was this again?

25:12.514 --> 25:13.974
Lace up so we can get moving.

25:14.389 --> 25:17.123
We had to pick the coldest day
of my entire life to do this?

25:17.223 --> 25:19.474
So go back to Timmies
and get a hot chocolate,

25:19.598 --> 25:21.974
'cause I'm going, and you can read
all about me in tomorrow's papers.

25:22.098 --> 25:24.557
Yeah, in the obituaries... maybe.

25:25.056 --> 25:26.557
I was watching T.V. last night,

25:26.664 --> 25:29.914
and they said that the lake shipping
is still bottled up in the seaway.

25:30.014 --> 25:32.890
So we're not going to get hit
by some speeding, raging ore boat?

25:37.681 --> 25:39.849
- Casey! Hey, man.
- Hey, what's up?

25:39.973 --> 25:42.373
I see you showed up.
What are you doing here?

25:42.473 --> 25:43.932
What do you think? I'm going.

25:44.306 --> 25:46.248
Did I stutter last night?
I said you're not going.

25:46.348 --> 25:49.873
- Come on, Rudy. Don't be such a dick.
- Yeah. Who died and made you king shit?

25:49.973 --> 25:52.057
The last king shit.

25:53.431 --> 25:57.807
Rudy, think about it this way. You know,
if we come across some rabid polar bears,

25:57.931 --> 25:59.182
you can just throw Casey
in front of them.

26:00.972 --> 26:02.598
That's a good point. I like that.

26:03.097 --> 26:05.640
Are there... are there
actually polar bears?

26:06.014 --> 26:09.557
It's a joke, you dumbass! Jesus!

26:09.972 --> 26:14.015
No, there's no polar bears, but I heard
some intense stories about this lake.

26:14.139 --> 26:16.140
Grandfather fished it for years.

26:16.264 --> 26:18.057
Fished or smuggled booze?

26:19.556 --> 26:22.182
We all know he didn't really spend
two years fishing in Florida.

26:22.306 --> 26:24.473
Yeah, I don't think you're one
to talk about family, bro.

26:25.889 --> 26:28.932
Okay. Are we going to skate?

26:33.597 --> 26:35.015
So...

26:35.139 --> 26:37.640
Casey, what happened
to the ice dogs game?

26:37.764 --> 26:39.765
Just another hockey game.

26:48.764 --> 26:53.265
Okay, so here's the plan.
I think we should stay as a tight group.

26:53.472 --> 26:55.973
One after the other,
about ten-yard separation, okay?

26:56.139 --> 26:57.956
- Okay.
- We've really got to be a team out there.

26:58.056 --> 27:00.265
Did everybody bring their extra food
and extra layers?

27:01.056 --> 27:02.914
Everybody got their cell phones?

27:03.014 --> 27:04.372
- Your cellphones?
- Check!

27:04.472 --> 27:08.039
I hope you guys have all your shit because
there's nothing but ice out there, okay?

27:08.139 --> 27:12.265
You guys ready to go? Let's do it!
Let's do it, boys! Let's go!

27:12.389 --> 27:14.182
Let's get out there!

28:07.347 --> 28:09.414
Believe this shit? It's like sex.

28:09.514 --> 28:12.307
- Couch cushions don't count.
- I'll take what I can get.

28:34.639 --> 28:35.848
Yeah!

28:36.681 --> 28:39.140
Wingman to group leader,
target at 11:00.

28:39.264 --> 28:42.473
Roger on that, Maverick.
Turning to one-niner. Weapons armed.

28:54.181 --> 28:55.390
Oh, yeah.

29:08.972 --> 29:13.247
Hollywood to goose, form up
on my six for low-level strafing pass.

29:13.347 --> 29:15.473
- Roger that, Hollywood.
- Forming up on your six.

29:15.597 --> 29:17.973
- Fire on all planes!
- Let's do it!

29:18.097 --> 29:21.223
Go! Let's go! Come on! Come on! Come on!

29:37.430 --> 29:38.890
Come on!

29:42.264 --> 29:44.223
Hello, boys!

29:44.514 --> 29:46.140
Hey, wait. Where are those guys going?

29:46.639 --> 29:48.015
To trouble.

29:48.847 --> 29:50.015
Yeah.

29:59.555 --> 30:02.705
Okay, boys. Time to get serious.
We got a long way to go.

30:02.805 --> 30:05.806
No, no, no. We're doing the whip.
We're doing the whip! We're doing the whip!

30:09.764 --> 30:11.348
- Hurry up.
- All right.

31:05.139 --> 31:07.140
- Slackjaw!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

31:08.805 --> 31:11.265
He broke out of it, Rudy!

31:18.764 --> 31:20.556
I got him! I got him!

31:21.264 --> 31:23.181
I'm coming!

32:42.889 --> 32:46.640
- What is that?
- Please, God, let it be a Timmies.

32:47.347 --> 32:49.996
If you had an open line to God,
why would you go so small?

32:50.097 --> 32:54.598
I mean, make it room at the Hilton with,
you know, a hot tub and some strippers.

33:19.472 --> 33:22.955
- Where the hell's the rest of the truck?
- And the guy driving it.

33:23.055 --> 33:24.889
Must have been swept off
in a storm or something.

33:25.597 --> 33:28.348
Who cares? As long
as we get out of this wind.

33:28.472 --> 33:30.473
Yeah. I'm freezing.

33:33.638 --> 33:34.806
A long way from home.

33:41.013 --> 33:44.306
This place is gross.
It's like my Uncle's bathroom.

33:44.430 --> 33:48.556
Everybody look for something we can use.
Anything can help. Just look around.

33:49.055 --> 33:51.098
We got some nice,
comfy cushions in here.

33:51.388 --> 33:53.639
I'm not sitting down on those.

33:53.763 --> 33:55.681
It's colder in here than it is outside.

33:56.097 --> 33:59.139
Can you please close
the goddamn door? Thank you.

34:00.305 --> 34:01.473
The frame is crooked.

34:02.138 --> 34:04.514
This disaster don't look
too secure, guys.

34:04.638 --> 34:07.681
Well, if you know of a better place,
I'm sure we'd all love to hear about it.

34:07.805 --> 34:11.848
It's not like we planned to get cozy
by the fire, kick back and watch T.V.

34:11.972 --> 34:15.139
Seriously, though, we all got to hydrate
and get some energy in us.

34:15.263 --> 34:17.014
You know what? You do that, Jimmy,

34:17.138 --> 34:21.098
and I'm going to eat some food
and maybe drink something.

34:24.013 --> 34:25.764
All right. So, what do you guys got?

34:26.347 --> 34:28.681
Cookies, granola bars, trail mix.

34:32.888 --> 34:34.139
Here, you know what? Let's make a table.

34:36.304 --> 34:38.139
Yeah, grab that.
No, get the big one, yeah.

34:38.263 --> 34:39.306
Here you go.

34:41.472 --> 34:44.764
Seriously? This is all you guys brought?

34:46.347 --> 34:49.098
Remind me not to bring you guys
on my next trip.

34:51.304 --> 34:54.556
Jolly Rancher, tangy meat-flavored.
Highly recommended. Want one?

34:55.347 --> 34:56.931
Yeah.

34:58.055 --> 35:00.806
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're going to share that with me, right?

35:01.138 --> 35:03.455
Seriously? You didn't bring a drink?

35:03.555 --> 35:05.889
Dude, look. Come on.

35:07.263 --> 35:09.330
You've got to be kidding me, guys!
I thought you said you'd be ready

35:09.430 --> 35:12.931
and you had all your stuff prepared.
You know what? Fine.

35:14.513 --> 35:15.497
Still want it?

35:15.597 --> 35:18.014
Why would you do that, man?
That's disgus...

35:23.305 --> 35:25.681
- You're sick, dude. You're sick.
- I love it.

35:27.347 --> 35:31.139
Jimmy, are you seriously going to sit there
and drink that whole thing in front of us?

35:31.263 --> 35:34.538
Yeah, you know...
We could kill you right now.

35:34.638 --> 35:38.639
- And nobody would ever find your body.
- What...?

35:40.680 --> 35:44.455
No, I lied. I don't want it. That's gross.
That tastes like pond water.

35:44.555 --> 35:46.473
Hey, at least it's warm pond water.

35:46.597 --> 35:48.872
You know Jimmy. He probably
put laxative in it or something.

35:48.972 --> 35:51.788
- It's just herbal tea and honey.
- Yeah, pond water.

35:51.888 --> 35:53.889
Hey, Art, I bet you he pissed in it.

35:54.972 --> 35:56.598
Come on, man!

35:58.430 --> 36:01.473
- You suck.
- Any more goodies in that bag, Jimmy?

36:02.888 --> 36:04.705
- Sterno can.
- Fire it up.

36:04.805 --> 36:06.764
- Yeah.
- Nice.

36:08.180 --> 36:09.681
There we go.

36:11.638 --> 36:13.306
Ain't that the prettiest thing
you've ever seen?

36:13.472 --> 36:15.538
We've got to be hyper-vigilant
about our use of time.

36:15.638 --> 36:18.306
You know, can you just for once try
and use some one-syllable words

36:18.430 --> 36:20.806
you know, for us regular retards?

36:21.138 --> 36:23.455
All I'm saying is that the ice
can be unpredictable, okay?

36:23.555 --> 36:26.246
- That's five syllables.
- Ice is formed from crystals,

36:26.346 --> 36:28.038
- which are hexagonal...
- Wait. What is that?

36:28.138 --> 36:29.621
- Four syllables?
- Four syllables!

36:29.721 --> 36:33.871
- Hexagons of oxygen and hydrogen...
- Six syllables! He's going up!

36:33.971 --> 36:36.597
In the middle of each hexagon,
is a hole.

36:36.888 --> 36:38.288
- Three!
- Three syllables!

36:38.388 --> 36:40.038
Look how smart he is!
Look how smart he is!

36:40.138 --> 36:42.205
- He's too freaking smart!
- It's a hole.

36:42.305 --> 36:45.389
That hole is why ice floats.
It's less dense than water.

36:46.096 --> 36:48.806
- What happens if somebody falls in?
- Nobody's going to fall in.

36:49.638 --> 36:52.621
- He'd turn into a popsicle.
- Worse.

36:52.721 --> 36:54.722
Most people think
it's hypothermia, but...

36:54.930 --> 36:56.764
the killer write-off
is cold-shock response.

36:57.471 --> 37:00.972
You gasp uncontrollably
until you inhale water and drown.

37:01.971 --> 37:04.580
If that doesn't get you,
then there's a good chance

37:04.680 --> 37:09.097
that the blood returning to your heart
is so cold that you go into cardiac arrest.

37:10.721 --> 37:11.722
You die.

37:15.013 --> 37:17.913
- Thank you, sunshine.
- I just shit my pants.

37:18.013 --> 37:21.306
I am in a great mood. Thanks for that.

37:21.430 --> 37:22.597
Jesus.

37:24.555 --> 37:27.806
Man. But at least your dad knows
something about cooking.

37:27.930 --> 37:30.972
- You two aren't going to starve.
- What do you mean?

37:36.763 --> 37:38.264
It's a small town, Case.

37:38.638 --> 37:42.514
People are so wrapped up in gossip here.
They don't have any lives of their own.

37:45.805 --> 37:49.139
Well, I hope you guys like
hotdogs medium-well to frozen.

37:49.471 --> 37:53.056
- Mine's getting toasty.
- Give me that.

38:07.805 --> 38:09.639
Everyone okay?

38:16.680 --> 38:18.639
Jesus Christ.

38:19.305 --> 38:21.181
Oh, my God!

38:23.221 --> 38:26.389
- What the hell!
- Nice going, dipshit!

38:26.805 --> 38:27.889
What a deathtrap.

38:30.638 --> 38:32.556
Where's my glove?

38:53.305 --> 38:55.222
Hey! Hey!

38:55.513 --> 38:58.121
- What?
- You okay, man?

38:58.221 --> 39:00.080
What's up, buddy?

39:00.180 --> 39:02.056
Don't you guys ever take a break?

39:02.846 --> 39:06.472
Come on, guys. Let's go. We got a lot
of ground to cover and not much light.

39:06.888 --> 39:09.205
Look, I'm just saying, I'm fine, but...

39:09.305 --> 39:11.597
I just need to catch my breath, okay?

39:12.096 --> 39:16.431
- I was so stupid for letting you come.
- It's too far to turn back now.

39:16.930 --> 39:19.972
- I have no idea where we are.
- We've got to be at least halfway, right?

39:20.096 --> 39:22.639
It's hard to tell without any landmarks.

39:24.930 --> 39:28.121
- Jesus. We're not even halfway.
- No!

39:28.221 --> 39:31.431
Look, I told you jerk-offs
it wasn't going to be easy, okay?

39:31.721 --> 39:34.181
- It's not like we're quitting.
- Jimmy, where are we going?

39:34.305 --> 39:37.455
We get even a couple degrees off and we
could be going to the middle of the lake,

39:37.555 --> 39:38.931
and next thing you know, it's spring.

39:39.305 --> 39:41.597
We need to go in a heading
of 170 degrees, so...

39:43.096 --> 39:45.371
New York is more that way.

39:45.471 --> 39:47.871
Okay. Let's just get going, man.
I'm freezing my balls off.

39:47.971 --> 39:50.264
- You won't need them.
- Yeah, but your mom will.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.514
I thought we were here to skate, man.

39:54.138 --> 39:57.014
- Relax, man! It was a joke!
- What the hell is your problem, man?

39:57.138 --> 40:00.139
We're here for a reason, aren't we?
Can we just go? Can we just skate, please?

40:43.971 --> 40:45.055
Crack!

40:46.179 --> 40:47.055
Crack!

40:57.179 --> 40:58.722
Crack!

41:17.346 --> 41:19.055
Another crack!

41:19.471 --> 41:21.079
Stop! Guys, stop! Look out!

41:21.179 --> 41:22.389
- Brake!
- Guys, stop!

41:22.596 --> 41:25.264
- Get back!
- Holy shit, man!

41:26.388 --> 41:28.347
That thing is huge!

41:28.638 --> 41:30.097
Holy shit!

41:31.596 --> 41:32.472
Oh, my God.

41:35.638 --> 41:37.222
You guys coming or what?

41:37.888 --> 41:39.097
What, are you serious?

41:39.221 --> 41:41.222
If we fall in the thing, they'll be
taking us home on a plank, bro.

41:41.388 --> 41:44.121
Take the tampons out
and just jump it. I did it!

41:44.221 --> 41:46.472
- No.
- Come back, Rudy.

41:46.804 --> 41:49.805
I'm not going back.
Figure it out, pussies. Hurry up!

41:50.429 --> 41:53.264
No... no way. It's too far.

41:54.013 --> 41:56.847
- Seriously?
- Dude, I'm surprised you jumped this thing.

41:56.971 --> 42:00.121
Of course I could do it!
Am I going to stand here all day alone?

42:00.221 --> 42:04.121
There's got to be some way across.
Jimmy, why don't...

42:04.221 --> 42:07.204
Why don't you and I head down that way?
Boney, you take Artie down that way.

42:07.304 --> 42:09.538
- And split up?
- We're already split-up.

42:09.638 --> 42:13.788
Artie's right, man. The last thing
we want to do is get... get separated.

42:13.888 --> 42:17.305
It's just ten minutes.
We don't find anything, we come back,

42:17.429 --> 42:19.805
and we'll figure
something else out, I guess.

42:22.971 --> 42:25.055
I know what I'm doing.

42:26.471 --> 42:28.264
Rudy, wait!

42:31.763 --> 42:32.805
Rudy!

42:35.221 --> 42:37.347
Is he leaving?

42:41.471 --> 42:44.805
No, no. He's just screwing with us.

42:44.929 --> 42:47.079
Let's just find a way across.
Ten minutes, okay?

42:47.179 --> 42:48.972
- Yeah, ten minutes.
- All right. Let's go.

42:49.304 --> 42:50.639
See you in a bit.

43:05.679 --> 43:08.472
Who pissed in Rudy's cheerios
this morning?

43:08.679 --> 43:11.621
I don't understand why he doesn't
just talk to someone about it.

43:11.721 --> 43:13.222
It's just Rudy.

43:15.929 --> 43:19.746
Casey, there's no way we're getting
across here, man. Let's just go back.

43:19.846 --> 43:21.097
Come on, just a little further.

43:21.221 --> 43:25.514
No, no. Like, back.
I mean, back, man. Back home.

43:25.638 --> 43:27.472
What are you doing?

43:27.596 --> 43:30.680
Just... I can't see a thing!

43:30.887 --> 43:34.246
I'm really scared, Casey!
Like, why are we even out here?

43:34.346 --> 43:36.638
Why'd we even follow through
with this dumbass...

43:36.762 --> 43:38.972
Calm down, man! It's not a big deal!
You're overreacting!

43:39.096 --> 43:40.972
We're fine! We're really fine!
We can do this!

43:41.096 --> 43:45.013
- I gotta come back. I can't do this anymore.
- Jesus Christ, Jimmy! Come on!

43:46.137 --> 43:47.847
Come on!

43:51.304 --> 43:53.097
Come on! What are you doing?

43:54.346 --> 43:56.621
Look at me. I'm Casey, okay?

43:56.721 --> 44:00.138
This is our lake.
We can do this. Look at me.

44:01.471 --> 44:03.513
Look at me. Look at me.

44:03.804 --> 44:05.472
Okay?

44:05.637 --> 44:07.222
- Okay.
- Okay?

44:07.929 --> 44:11.180
I just... Okay, Casey.

44:11.304 --> 44:14.621
Just let me up, okay? I'm fine.

44:14.721 --> 44:16.180
Okay.

44:20.971 --> 44:22.555
Okay?

44:22.846 --> 44:24.722
Yeah.

44:25.262 --> 44:27.013
I'm okay.

44:28.262 --> 44:32.246
Okay, we should... we should
head back towards the guys.

44:32.346 --> 44:35.013
They're probably wondering about us.

44:36.637 --> 44:38.180
Okay. Let's go.

44:38.304 --> 44:40.555
Do you think they found anything?

44:59.346 --> 45:02.287
Hey, Boney. Boney!

45:02.387 --> 45:03.930
What?

45:07.471 --> 45:08.972
Holy shit!

45:10.679 --> 45:13.472
- This is a kid!
- Shut up.

45:14.929 --> 45:17.847
No, seriously, look! Look at this thing.

45:17.971 --> 45:19.097
This is a body.

45:21.929 --> 45:25.180
Think about what you just said.
Why would there be a kid way out here?

45:25.887 --> 45:29.888
I don't know.
What are we doing out here?

45:30.346 --> 45:32.513
It's not a kid. It's a pair of jeans.

45:32.721 --> 45:35.680
It probably blew off
someone's laundry line.

45:40.887 --> 45:44.347
Okay. Come on. We're not getting
across here. Let's go.

45:46.262 --> 45:48.347
Why do you think he's doing this?

45:50.846 --> 45:52.472
Why'd he do it?

45:55.179 --> 45:56.680
What are you talking about?
He jumped the gap.

45:56.804 --> 45:58.180
Yeah, but he took off.

45:58.304 --> 46:00.805
He's just having fun.
We'll get across and find him.

46:01.179 --> 46:03.972
But what if we don't? What if he's gone?

46:04.096 --> 46:06.013
You worry too much, buddy.

46:06.137 --> 46:10.287
You said so yourself.
He's just messing with us. That's it.

46:10.387 --> 46:12.638
My dad's going to be so pissed.

46:14.221 --> 46:15.138
Come on.

46:15.971 --> 46:18.513
Get up. Get up. Come on. Stand up.

46:20.221 --> 46:24.638
Look at me. We'll find Rudy.
I promise. Okay?

46:24.762 --> 46:26.430
Yeah.

46:26.721 --> 46:29.055
Come on. Let's go find the guys.

46:37.471 --> 46:39.180
Hey, guys.

46:39.721 --> 46:40.763
We got nothing.

46:42.804 --> 46:44.513
I didn't see him on our end.

46:46.471 --> 46:48.638
- Rudy! Rudy!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

46:48.762 --> 46:51.680
Art, forget it, man. He split.

46:53.221 --> 46:54.222
He split?

46:55.346 --> 46:57.204
Where would he have gone?

46:57.304 --> 46:59.412
New York, dummy. Without us.

46:59.512 --> 47:02.120
Is that what he was thinking
the entire time? He was just going to...

47:02.220 --> 47:03.680
Ditch us and go off by himself?

47:03.970 --> 47:06.805
Things have been getting worse at home,
but he wouldn't just bail.

47:07.012 --> 47:09.388
Really? Well, look.

47:11.470 --> 47:13.055
It was a stupid idea anyway.

47:37.637 --> 47:40.930
- What's he doing?
- Casey, what are you...

47:47.762 --> 47:48.846
He's out of his mind.

47:49.054 --> 47:51.846
Holy shit! We're all going to die!

48:25.512 --> 48:27.638
Oh, my God.

48:29.804 --> 48:32.346
Dude, for a minute,
I thought we were done!

48:34.054 --> 48:38.638
Did it occur to anybody that we got to get
back across this thing on the way home?

48:39.345 --> 48:41.680
It's cold enough.
Let's hope it freezes over.

48:41.804 --> 48:44.912
- Okay, come on. Let's go find Rudy.
- Yeah. Let's go.

48:45.012 --> 48:47.180
- Yeah!
- I'm freezing my ass off.

48:49.220 --> 48:50.930
That was extreme!

49:35.887 --> 49:37.846
What the hell, man?

49:38.720 --> 49:41.704
- Where were you going?
- Nowhere.

49:41.804 --> 49:43.346
That's horseshit, Rudy. Come on.

49:43.470 --> 49:45.596
- Just give me my hat back.
- No.

49:49.554 --> 49:51.555
You were ready to leave me behind
to deal with Dad.

49:51.970 --> 49:54.245
No. Yeah, I...

49:54.345 --> 49:57.305
- Look, I don't know.
- Could have fooled me.

49:57.804 --> 50:00.805
Yeah. Yeah, I was. I took off, okay?

50:01.137 --> 50:05.013
For the first time in my life, I feel like
I'm finally doing something just for me.

50:05.137 --> 50:06.680
I don't want to go back home.

50:08.429 --> 50:10.721
When you got to New York,
what were you going to do?

50:10.929 --> 50:14.787
I don't know. Didn't matter, because...

50:14.887 --> 50:17.680
I mean, anything's better
than what I got right now.

50:18.179 --> 50:22.805
What do I have to look forward to?
Driving a truck for my dad?

50:23.304 --> 50:26.013
- This is my chance to get out!
- What about me?

50:30.928 --> 50:31.804
What about you?

50:31.928 --> 50:34.596
What, I get to stay behind
and be Dad's punching bag?

50:36.053 --> 50:39.513
I've been there for you.
I can't be the punching bag forever.

50:41.720 --> 50:42.638
Then just go.

50:46.178 --> 50:47.763
Go.

50:59.262 --> 51:01.138
Are you coming?

51:59.220 --> 52:02.471
All right, wait. You know what?
Take out your phone.

52:02.595 --> 52:04.620
Let's try and...

52:04.720 --> 52:06.245
Try to see where we are, okay?

52:06.345 --> 52:09.120
Let's use that island
as a landmark, all right?

52:09.220 --> 52:10.804
Yeah.

52:14.220 --> 52:16.096
- Oh, shit, guys.
- What?

52:16.220 --> 52:17.846
- What is it?
- My phone froze up.

52:18.345 --> 52:21.870
- Restart your phone.
- No, like... frozen-frozen.

52:21.970 --> 52:24.971
I didn't put it in the inside pocket
the last time I used it.

52:25.095 --> 52:27.120
I think the battery's froze up.

52:27.220 --> 52:29.471
Jimmy the genius didn't think
about this beforehand?

52:29.595 --> 52:32.346
Okay. Everybody, check your phones.

52:35.887 --> 52:38.763
You piece of shit. No, I got nothing.

52:40.803 --> 52:41.804
Yeah, I got no bars.

52:41.928 --> 52:45.120
Maybe we have no signal because
we're on the American side of the border.

52:45.220 --> 52:46.013
Maybe.

52:46.137 --> 52:50.179
Well, do the plugs want to stand here all day
freezing or do you want to keep on going?

52:50.678 --> 52:53.221
Hey, Broadway, Times Square. I'm in.

52:53.928 --> 52:56.763
Any of you geniuses actually
ever look at a map of New York?

53:22.803 --> 53:24.263
That's going to be fun.

53:24.470 --> 53:27.471
Boys, looks like we got to go over.

53:27.845 --> 53:29.429
This is going to suck.

54:06.470 --> 54:08.096
King of the world!

54:41.678 --> 54:42.971
There it is, boys.

54:43.845 --> 54:48.012
Gentlemen, as promised,
the empire state of New York!

54:51.928 --> 54:53.512
Yeah, buddy!

54:53.636 --> 54:55.078
Man...

54:55.178 --> 54:58.536
We are now crossing the sovereign
territory of the United States.

54:58.636 --> 55:01.054
Anything to declare, comrades?

55:02.970 --> 55:04.596
Nope.

55:06.261 --> 55:09.471
We did it. Think we'll be
on both Canadian and U.S. T.V.?

55:10.136 --> 55:12.971
We'll be on freaking Al Jazeera.

55:13.303 --> 55:16.745
Guys, before you start practicing
your acceptance speeches,

55:16.845 --> 55:19.637
- we still got a long way to go.
- Where are you going?

55:19.761 --> 55:23.078
I've got to take a piss. Want to help me?
You want to hold it up for me?

55:23.178 --> 55:27.370
- This ain't no time for modesty, bro.
- He's afraid we're going to see.

55:27.470 --> 55:29.536
What? His vagina?

55:29.636 --> 55:32.221
No. His small dick!

55:34.470 --> 55:36.762
- Help me!
- Rudy!

55:38.886 --> 55:40.620
- Help!
- Rudy!

55:40.720 --> 55:42.203
Shit! Rudy!

55:42.303 --> 55:44.179
- No, no, wait!
- Get me out!

55:44.970 --> 55:46.971
Get him out of there! Help him! Come on!

55:47.095 --> 55:49.137
- It's freezing!
- We could fall in too, okay?

55:49.261 --> 55:50.911
- We need a rope, Jimmy!
- Art!

55:51.011 --> 55:52.453
- Where are we going to get a rope?
- I don't know!

55:52.553 --> 55:54.245
Somebody do something!
He's going to die!

55:54.345 --> 55:56.620
- Keep your head up!
- Just stay calm, okay?

55:56.720 --> 55:59.971
- Rudy!
- Grab my jacket!

56:01.303 --> 56:05.971
I can't reach it! Guys, help!
Come on! Throw it again!

56:06.095 --> 56:07.262
I'm trying!

56:08.303 --> 56:10.304
- I can't reach it!
- Grab my jacket!

56:10.428 --> 56:13.245
- He's dying! Quick!
- Grab onto me, guys! Come on!

56:13.345 --> 56:16.304
- Pull me up!
- Okay! Three, two, one!

56:18.720 --> 56:19.762
One more time!

56:21.053 --> 56:24.471
- Get him out! Come on!
- Grab it! Hold on tight! On my count!

56:24.595 --> 56:26.429
Three, two, one!

56:29.761 --> 56:31.721
Okay, pull!

56:32.136 --> 56:34.596
- Get me out! Pull me out!
- Two, one, together!

56:36.636 --> 56:38.179
You've got to hold!

56:39.011 --> 56:41.262
Pull me up! Pull!

56:42.345 --> 56:45.221
- Get him out.
- Come on, Rudy.

56:48.011 --> 56:49.971
Get him up. Get him up. Stand him up.

56:50.095 --> 56:51.245
- You okay, man?
- He's freezing.

56:51.345 --> 56:53.304
Get him up.

56:53.970 --> 56:55.411
Hey, guys, we've got to get
these clothes off.

56:55.511 --> 56:57.679
- It's gonna be okay.
- Casey, you got anything in your bag?

56:57.803 --> 57:01.471
Yeah, there's a shirt in there, I think.
Everybody pitch in a layer.

57:01.678 --> 57:03.262
Get his jacket off.

57:04.761 --> 57:08.221
Get the other sleeve. It's okay, buddy.
We're going to get you warm. Okay?

57:10.303 --> 57:13.721
Hey, Art, I got hats and hot packs
in that back pocket.

57:13.928 --> 57:15.578
Get the other sleeve.

57:15.678 --> 57:16.953
Jimmy, give me a hand here. Come on.

57:17.053 --> 57:18.370
There's no pants in here, man.

57:18.470 --> 57:21.120
- Knee warmers in the back pocket...
- No, no. I found it. I found it.

57:21.220 --> 57:23.012
Let's get you warm. Yes, thank you.

57:25.178 --> 57:26.619
I got a hoodie when you guys are ready.

57:26.719 --> 57:29.595
Jimmy. Okay.

57:31.386 --> 57:34.137
- Here you go.
- Here, put these on his back.

57:35.553 --> 57:37.036
Come on, come on! Good, good.

57:37.136 --> 57:38.970
Okay, thanks.

57:39.094 --> 57:41.619
- Does anyone have a coat?
- His jacket. Here.

57:41.719 --> 57:42.619
Casey.

57:42.719 --> 57:44.387
Thank you.

57:45.511 --> 57:47.637
- We got to warm him up.
- He's got to be warm by now though, right?

57:47.928 --> 57:49.286
No, his core temperature's dropping.

57:49.386 --> 57:52.953
His body's giving up on his extremities
in order to save his vital organs.

57:53.053 --> 57:54.953
Here, get his skates off.

57:55.053 --> 57:56.804
You'll be okay.

57:56.928 --> 57:59.012
Are you okay?

57:59.969 --> 58:01.512
- I got them. I got them.
- There.

58:03.511 --> 58:05.244
It's okay. You're okay.

58:05.344 --> 58:07.262
Hypothermia's going
to set in any second.

58:07.469 --> 58:09.304
We got to get him to shore
as soon as we can, man.

58:09.428 --> 58:10.929
You're going to be okay.
You're going to be okay.

58:18.303 --> 58:20.470
- It's going to be fine.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

58:20.803 --> 58:22.095
Right skate first.

58:24.219 --> 58:25.429
Get him up.

59:09.011 --> 59:10.619
Over here! Come on! Over here!

59:10.719 --> 59:12.637
- Help us!
- Hey!

59:22.011 --> 59:24.054
Will you please help us?

59:25.636 --> 59:27.304
Having a nice day, fellas?

59:28.219 --> 59:31.012
- My brother fell in the lake.
- We need to get him someplace warm.

59:31.136 --> 59:33.470
Dude, awesome truck.

59:33.803 --> 59:35.554
Well, is there a...

59:35.969 --> 59:39.137
is there a sign up top that says
"chump taxi service"?

59:39.636 --> 59:41.804
Please! He's freezing!

59:42.428 --> 59:44.345
Oh, dude, come on, man!
You're not even going to help us?

59:44.469 --> 59:47.929
- He's going to die if you don't help!
- Come on, man!

59:50.469 --> 59:53.429
Iceman's the name. Get in.

59:55.011 --> 59:58.220
There's room for three of you in the cab.
The other two, up back.

59:58.719 --> 01:00:00.036
Jimmy and Boney,
why don't you guys go in the back?

01:00:00.136 --> 01:00:03.328
Better make sure frosty the snowman
doesn't drip all over the place.

01:00:03.428 --> 01:00:05.929
Rudy, we're going to get you warm.
It's going to be fine.

01:00:07.803 --> 01:00:11.470
Careful with the stiletto heels there.
Just got new mats.

01:00:14.094 --> 01:00:16.387
- Okay.
- You okay?

01:00:16.678 --> 01:00:19.137
- How come we had to get in the back?
- Watch out. It's slippery.

01:00:19.261 --> 01:00:20.929
Help me up.

01:00:22.303 --> 01:00:24.137
That's bullshit.

01:00:41.553 --> 01:00:43.744
Hey, do you mind
if we turn the heat a little?

01:00:43.844 --> 01:00:46.429
Guys. Geez, man, it's already
a sweatbox in here,

01:00:47.303 --> 01:00:49.679
but hey, whatever lifts your skirt.

01:00:53.261 --> 01:00:55.619
I'm cranking it up to the top.

01:00:55.719 --> 01:00:57.262
So...

01:00:57.677 --> 01:00:59.303
Where you dudes coming from?

01:00:59.886 --> 01:01:01.536
Canada.

01:01:01.636 --> 01:01:04.762
Oh. Canucks?

01:01:07.136 --> 01:01:10.137
It's... it's a long way from home.

01:01:10.636 --> 01:01:13.470
Yeah. Actually, we're going to New York.

01:01:14.302 --> 01:01:17.827
It's tricky traveling out here,
especially when you're riding on nothing

01:01:17.927 --> 01:01:21.178
but a couple butter knives
on shoes, right?

01:01:21.802 --> 01:01:24.536
It's a big skating rink, but...

01:01:24.636 --> 01:01:27.887
I guess you guys probably know
the best route back to Canada.

01:01:29.136 --> 01:01:30.595
Yeah.

01:01:30.802 --> 01:01:33.762
- We're going to New York, aren't we?
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:35.136 --> 01:01:37.762
I don't think we're headed
to New York anymore.

01:01:38.052 --> 01:01:41.970
- What do you mean?
- I'm pretty sure we never turned around.

01:01:43.927 --> 01:01:47.137
You sure, Jimmy? You've got
to be absolutely positive, man.

01:01:47.261 --> 01:01:49.303
I'm telling you, man.
We're headed back to Canada.

01:01:53.677 --> 01:01:56.387
- I'm riding shotgun.
- Holy shit, dude.

01:01:58.969 --> 01:02:01.220
Hey, excuse me?

01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:04.202
Listen, we really appreciate
the ride and everything,

01:02:04.302 --> 01:02:07.178
but you can just drop us off here.
We think we're going the wrong way.

01:02:11.052 --> 01:02:12.345
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:02:12.469 --> 01:02:13.952
- Guys, we're going the wrong way!
- Casey!

01:02:14.052 --> 01:02:17.762
You've got to turn the truck around!
We're headed towards the gap!

01:02:22.802 --> 01:02:26.387
- I think we're going the wrong way.
- Ask any number of people, skippy.

01:02:26.719 --> 01:02:30.637
I went the wrong way... a long time ago.

01:02:31.011 --> 01:02:33.911
Dude, there's a huge-ass crack that way.
We're going to die.

01:02:34.011 --> 01:02:37.178
- Turn this goddamn truck around, man!
- Sit down.

01:02:40.302 --> 01:02:42.202
Really, I think we've
been this way before.

01:02:42.302 --> 01:02:47.303
I bet you know all kinds of coves and little
hideaways across the Canadian side.

01:03:07.136 --> 01:03:09.178
Get down. Get down!

01:03:21.344 --> 01:03:25.012
- Hey, Jimmy, check it out.
- What is that stuff?

01:03:25.136 --> 01:03:27.637
- They're smugglers.
- What do we do? Are you sure?

01:03:27.761 --> 01:03:30.036
Yeah, yeah, yeah. My grandfather
did it for years. Trust me.

01:03:30.136 --> 01:03:33.553
- Shit! What are we going to do?
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:03:38.511 --> 01:03:39.553
Casey, look.

01:03:41.136 --> 01:03:42.803
I think this guy wants you to pull over.

01:03:43.594 --> 01:03:46.803
Well, I want to be chilling
in a hot tub with Jennifer Lopez.

01:03:46.969 --> 01:03:49.637
Don't mean it's going to happen.

01:04:11.969 --> 01:04:14.303
- Whoa! What the hell, man?
- Oh, shit!

01:04:16.511 --> 01:04:18.303
Whoa! Stop, man!

01:04:18.469 --> 01:04:21.178
- You need to pull over!
- Shut your mouth.

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:26.386
Sorry!

01:04:28.177 --> 01:04:29.095
Hey!

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:34.136
- Throw them over. Start throwing them over.
- Hey, iceman!

01:04:34.427 --> 01:04:37.261
We're throwing your cigarettes over!

01:04:38.844 --> 01:04:41.785
- Hey!
- Yeah, money!

01:04:41.885 --> 01:04:43.803
- Oh, what the...
- Iceman!

01:04:43.927 --> 01:04:47.577
It's my fault.
I got us into this crazy shit.

01:04:47.677 --> 01:04:50.428
Nobody forced anybody. We all wanted to.

01:05:08.969 --> 01:05:12.011
Let's get out of here.
Get him out, quick.

01:05:12.135 --> 01:05:13.595
- Casey.
- Hey!

01:05:14.385 --> 01:05:15.577
Let's get the hell out of here, guys.

01:05:15.677 --> 01:05:16.910
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:19.285
- Where are we?
- What the hell happened, man?

01:05:19.385 --> 01:05:20.636
Casey grabbed the wheel.

01:05:27.135 --> 01:05:29.053
New York's that way.

01:05:33.052 --> 01:05:34.886
Hey!

01:05:35.385 --> 01:05:38.928
Can't believe you did that, Case.
That's awesome.

01:05:39.844 --> 01:05:41.886
Piece of crap.

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:16.678
Almost there, man. Almost there.

01:06:28.594 --> 01:06:30.136
I'm so done.

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.511
No, you're not, asshole.
One foot in front of the other. Come on.

01:06:32.927 --> 01:06:35.428
- I don't think I can.
- Yeah, you can.

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.553
Get your head in the game.

01:06:40.427 --> 01:06:42.928
Okay? Everyone, we're almost there!
Come on!

01:08:22.926 --> 01:08:26.053
- Oh, we did it!
- We got here, guys!

01:08:26.176 --> 01:08:28.577
- What are the odds?
- New York!

01:08:28.676 --> 01:08:32.136
- New York.
- Land! Land!

01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:33.785
I'm not getting back on that lake.

01:08:33.885 --> 01:08:36.410
I've never been so happy
to see a lighthouse.

01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:38.285
I'm getting a New York steak.

01:08:38.385 --> 01:08:39.910
- I can't believe it.
- Coney Island dog.

01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:44.535
- That and buffalo wings.
- And a Philly cheese steak.

01:08:44.635 --> 01:08:47.660
Philly cheese steak?
Philly is not in New York.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.761
- I don't care. I'm just getting one.
- You guys are awesome.

01:08:53.093 --> 01:08:55.660
This is so much better
in front of the fire.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.803
It's good to be inside finally.

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:02.303
Ain't that the prettiest thing
you've ever seen?

01:09:02.718 --> 01:09:04.368
- One, two, three.
- What's up?

01:09:04.468 --> 01:09:07.827
Great. Good one. How you guys doing?
Looks like you had a hard day.

01:09:07.926 --> 01:09:09.928
Can I get you something to drink?

01:09:10.135 --> 01:09:12.469
- Oh, please do.
- Yes, please.

01:09:12.593 --> 01:09:15.702
- Yeah. We just skated all the way from...
- Shut the hell up.

01:09:15.801 --> 01:09:17.910
Yeah, I'll get a Long Island
iced tea, please.

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:20.678
A Long Island iced tea. Fine choice.

01:09:20.885 --> 01:09:23.636
And I'll have you
with extra whipped cream.

01:09:23.843 --> 01:09:26.702
You're not appropriate, but I like it anyway.
Anybody else? Something?

01:09:26.801 --> 01:09:30.868
Dude, iced, seriously? Come on, we've been
on ice all day. Get something warm.

01:09:30.968 --> 01:09:34.136
- Irish coffee? Irish coffee?
- I like that. A round of Irish coffees.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.844
Irish coffees. It's my favorite drink.

01:09:37.051 --> 01:09:40.202
No way. They're, like, my favorite, too.
We have so much in common.

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:41.761
- Oh, my God.
- So good.

01:09:41.885 --> 01:09:44.386
We are made for each other.
Okay, I'll be back.

01:09:44.593 --> 01:09:45.577
God, she's hot.

01:09:45.676 --> 01:09:47.285
- Thank you.
- Damn, dude.

01:09:47.385 --> 01:09:49.011
- She was so hitting on you.
- Was she?

01:09:49.135 --> 01:09:51.636
- Oh, yeah, totally.
- Nice.

01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:54.928
Dude, when that guy in the truck
just came peeling in...

01:09:55.052 --> 01:09:56.368
- Yeah.
- What was his name?

01:09:56.468 --> 01:09:59.368
- "You can call me...
- Iceman."

01:09:59.468 --> 01:10:00.660
That was awesome.

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.136
His buddy in the back?
Didn't even know he was there.

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:06.303
Me and he were in the back. Some dude comes
out of nowhere with a double-barrel shotgun.

01:10:06.427 --> 01:10:08.178
- Just popping rounds off.
- There was a shotgun?

01:10:08.302 --> 01:10:10.202
I thought the car hit
the bank and backfired.

01:10:10.302 --> 01:10:12.803
- Shotgun.
- By the way, thanks for ditching us at the gap.

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:15.803
Come on. Did you see me clear...
it was insane!

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:17.535
You should have seen us do it, though.

01:10:17.635 --> 01:10:20.327
Dude, we couldn't find a way across.
We had to figure out a way to jump.

01:10:20.427 --> 01:10:22.636
- How'd you guys do that, by the way?
- Whip!

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.194
- Whip!
- Not even joking.

01:10:24.318 --> 01:10:25.827
You whipped it? No way.
I don't believe you.

01:10:25.927 --> 01:10:27.910
- Over the gap, I swear to God.
- Seriously?

01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:29.602
Dude, I didn't think this guy
was going to make it.

01:10:29.702 --> 01:10:33.993
You know, Rudy, I've been meaning to ask...
how cold was that water?

01:10:34.093 --> 01:10:35.743
You're a dickhead.
You're going to help me defrost.

01:10:35.843 --> 01:10:38.428
Okay. Here we go.

01:10:38.927 --> 01:10:40.910
- Yeah, right?
- Thank you, sweetheart.

01:10:41.010 --> 01:10:43.803
You're welcome. My pleasure.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.035
This isn't Irish coffee.

01:10:49.135 --> 01:10:52.618
No, but if you want
to show me some I.D.,

01:10:52.718 --> 01:10:55.303
I can give you some alcohol.
Otherwise, out in the parking lot.

01:10:55.427 --> 01:10:56.844
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:10:58.468 --> 01:11:02.219
You're cute, but...
don't bleed on my furniture.

01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:04.678
Might want to clean that up, boss.

01:11:05.968 --> 01:11:09.035
Hey, I think you should take a look
at that in the mirror.

01:11:09.135 --> 01:11:11.844
Yeah. I'll be back in a minute.

01:11:52.051 --> 01:11:53.636
Jess.

01:11:57.926 --> 01:11:58.844
Casey?

01:12:10.635 --> 01:12:12.826
- Casey, let me explain.
- There's nothing to explain.

01:12:12.926 --> 01:12:14.243
- You don't under...
- Yes, I do!

01:12:14.343 --> 01:12:16.136
- No, you don't...
- I don't want to talk about it!

01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:19.552
Just please go back inside!
I don't want to talk about it.

01:12:19.926 --> 01:12:22.844
Did you follow me here?
What are you doing here?

01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:27.969
What are you doing here?

01:12:28.885 --> 01:12:31.660
Dr. Janeau wanted to go
to his office in Syracuse

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.219
and drop some stuff off,
and he wanted some company.

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.302
I guess those stitches worked out
pretty well for both of you.

01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:43.052
That is not fair.

01:12:44.051 --> 01:12:45.302
What are you doing here?

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:47.761
We skated.

01:12:52.635 --> 01:12:55.261
- Across the lake?
- Yeah, the whole thing, all of us.

01:12:55.968 --> 01:12:58.035
- And your dad just let you...
- He didn't know.

01:12:58.135 --> 01:13:00.636
- Of course he didn't.
- None of us told anybody.

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.636
Casey, you could have gotten hurt!
You could have got lost...

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.719
But we did it! We did it!

01:13:04.843 --> 01:13:09.261
We did it! I did it! And we...
I'm happy! I was proud!

01:13:19.801 --> 01:13:21.094
Go inside, please.

01:13:23.135 --> 01:13:25.593
I need to call your father. We've got to figure
out how we're going to get you all home.

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:27.736
I'm not going to lie to him for you.

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:30.261
I wouldn't expect you to.

01:13:30.635 --> 01:13:32.594
Sweetheart, your stitches are...

01:13:59.593 --> 01:14:00.927
Casey, honey.

01:14:02.843 --> 01:14:04.469
Get off, man.

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.969
Yeah, we're here.

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:08.344
Yo.

01:14:08.635 --> 01:14:09.469
Heads up.

01:14:13.176 --> 01:14:15.344
- Thanks, man.
- Peace, buddy.

01:14:15.468 --> 01:14:17.052
Good night, Casey.

01:14:19.635 --> 01:14:20.677
Good night, sweetheart.

01:14:29.635 --> 01:14:32.511
Hey, thanks for the lift,
but we can walk from here.

01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:33.719
Thanks.

01:14:33.926 --> 01:14:38.344
Everybody, stay put. You guys have caused
enough excitement for one day.

01:14:40.051 --> 01:14:42.094
Okay, fine.

01:14:56.759 --> 01:15:00.534
Okay! Yeah, you guys show
this intensity tomorrow night,

01:15:00.634 --> 01:15:02.760
and the Tmberwolves are going
to know they're in for a fight!

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:07.719
Bring it in!

01:15:07.926 --> 01:15:09.927
Let's go, Demas.

01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:15.243
All right, guys, I don't want you
to get all worked up,

01:15:15.343 --> 01:15:18.409
but tomorrow night, one of the coaches
in Cornwall is coming by to have a look.

01:15:18.509 --> 01:15:19.701
What do you mean? The Cornwall Colts?

01:15:19.801 --> 01:15:22.885
Yeah. Now, I don't want to see
any puck-hogging or showboating.

01:15:23.093 --> 01:15:24.368
They want to see your speed and skill,

01:15:24.468 --> 01:15:26.635
but they also want to see if you can play
in a team system, alright?

01:15:26.759 --> 01:15:29.094
Wait. Someone from the juniors
is coming to watch us?

01:15:29.218 --> 01:15:31.993
If you get chippy out there, I guarantee you,
you'll be gone by the end of the first period.

01:15:32.093 --> 01:15:34.177
Guys, forget about the scouts.
Just play our game.

01:15:34.384 --> 01:15:35.802
Yeah, that's what I want to hear.

01:15:36.259 --> 01:15:39.052
Let's finish up with some
penalty shots, guys. Come on.

01:15:39.759 --> 01:15:40.635
Let's go!

01:15:49.884 --> 01:15:51.302
Here we come, Demas!

01:15:53.926 --> 01:15:55.427
- Nice.
- Yeah, buddy!

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:56.844
Nice.

01:15:59.593 --> 01:16:01.760
That's it. Stay locked in!

01:16:05.134 --> 01:16:08.260
Nice! Good poke. Good poke.

01:16:09.093 --> 01:16:12.552
Good poke! Guys, focus.

01:16:15.259 --> 01:16:17.927
Hey. Case.

01:16:18.426 --> 01:16:20.802
Just 'cause he's dangling doesn't mean
he won't snipe you like that.

01:16:20.926 --> 01:16:24.368
- Hey, Doug! Doug, get off the ice.
- Just give me a minute.

01:16:24.468 --> 01:16:25.927
- Hey, come on.
- You were a goalie.

01:16:26.051 --> 01:16:27.760
- Come on, you know better than this.
- I got to talk to you.

01:16:29.968 --> 01:16:34.260
Hey, stop standing around. Bouchard,
hit the net. Keep it up, guys. Let's go.

01:16:37.884 --> 01:16:39.135
What are you doing? Come on.

01:16:39.259 --> 01:16:42.493
Case, you're just forgetting your basics.
Did you feel it? You must've felt it.

01:16:42.593 --> 01:16:45.409
It's obvious. Look, show them a little net.
Draw them in. It's goalie 101.

01:16:45.509 --> 01:16:48.552
You can't do this. You can't come out
on the ice like that. That's not cool.

01:16:48.676 --> 01:16:51.034
- I have to go back out.
- I know. Focus, set, save...

01:16:51.134 --> 01:16:54.802
I know that! I'm not in select, okay?
I have to go back out there!

01:16:59.884 --> 01:17:03.510
I know I haven't been there for you, but I'm
trying to explain something to you, Case.

01:17:03.718 --> 01:17:06.701
You've got to take charge,
give him what he thinks is an opening,

01:17:06.801 --> 01:17:09.385
make him shoot the shot
you know you can stop.

01:17:15.551 --> 01:17:17.427
I got to go.

01:17:49.176 --> 01:17:51.760
Hey! Hey, Casey!

01:17:52.759 --> 01:17:54.677
Hey! Hey!

01:17:55.343 --> 01:17:56.159
Hey.

01:17:56.259 --> 01:17:58.177
You look like you got
a pretty heavy load there.

01:18:00.051 --> 01:18:04.844
Are you demented or just naturally stubborn?
Here, let me help. Okay, wow.

01:18:05.343 --> 01:18:08.302
Maybe next time, you should think
about picking a position with lighter gear.

01:18:08.801 --> 01:18:11.010
I like being goalie.

01:18:12.009 --> 01:18:18.010
Okay. You like people shooting projectiles
at you like they're coming out of a gun.

01:18:18.926 --> 01:18:21.635
The puck doesn't go in, we can't lose.
Kind of makes it my game.

01:18:21.759 --> 01:18:23.510
That's a little bit of pressure,
don't you think?

01:18:24.092 --> 01:18:26.201
I don't know. I guess it's like that.

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:29.260
They say that a goalie
has to have a bad memory

01:18:29.384 --> 01:18:31.826
so he can begin every game
with a fresh start.

01:18:31.926 --> 01:18:33.135
How's that working?

01:18:33.259 --> 01:18:35.927
Sometimes, better than others.
Can't always control it.

01:18:37.967 --> 01:18:40.802
I saw you back there with your dad.

01:18:41.176 --> 01:18:44.135
You two looked like
you were kind of going at it.

01:18:46.509 --> 01:18:49.177
Does every single person
in this town know everything?

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:53.093
Small town curse.

01:18:53.884 --> 01:18:55.510
Well, anyway...

01:18:57.092 --> 01:18:58.843
I go this way.

01:18:59.967 --> 01:19:01.635
I'm up here.

01:19:03.717 --> 01:19:05.927
- Yeah, sorry.
- Yeah, thank you.

01:19:28.384 --> 01:19:29.927
Yeah.

01:19:31.676 --> 01:19:32.968
I should...

01:19:33.634 --> 01:19:36.552
I guess I should probably go.

01:19:37.342 --> 01:19:39.010
Where are you going to go?

01:19:41.301 --> 01:19:42.343
I have to work out.

01:19:43.676 --> 01:19:46.593
Yeah? Yeah? You've got to work out?

01:19:49.342 --> 01:19:53.593
- How long is that going to take?
- Not long. An hour. Not long.

01:19:59.092 --> 01:20:04.343
I have a hockey game tomorrow night,
but you want to hang out after that?

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:07.093
Yeah.

01:20:08.259 --> 01:20:12.135
Good work, Demas. There's hope yet.

01:20:36.009 --> 01:20:39.260
Hey. I thought you were
coming in tomorrow.

01:20:43.092 --> 01:20:44.718
This is for you.

01:20:48.926 --> 01:20:51.635
- Thank you.
- Do you like it?

01:20:52.842 --> 01:20:54.034
Yeah, it's great.

01:20:54.134 --> 01:20:56.510
I thought maybe
you could use it in the game.

01:20:58.801 --> 01:21:01.885
Probably need some time
to work it in first.

01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:05.218
Of course.

01:21:06.551 --> 01:21:11.218
Can you hold onto it until later?
Just until later?

01:21:15.884 --> 01:21:18.242
Okay... I should...

01:21:18.342 --> 01:21:20.093
- Thank you.
- Have a great game.

01:21:20.217 --> 01:21:22.302
Don't get hurt.

01:22:33.384 --> 01:22:36.426
Play like men!
Not like a bunch of pussies! Damn it!

01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:39.760
Dad! Sit down. You're embarrassing us.

01:22:39.884 --> 01:22:42.760
- What?
- Sit down!

01:23:05.842 --> 01:23:09.301
Yeah! Let's go! Go! Whoo! Do it!

01:23:26.259 --> 01:23:28.968
- They're pulling the goalie!
- See that, boys? They're coming hard!

01:23:29.092 --> 01:23:30.968
Change two! Go, go, go!

01:24:43.259 --> 01:24:44.718
Hey!

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.301
Casey!

01:24:48.009 --> 01:24:49.593
Casey!

01:25:20.259 --> 01:25:22.658
- Hey.
- Hey, handsome. Nice goal.

01:25:22.758 --> 01:25:24.908
- You want a lift?
- I think I'm okay.

01:25:25.008 --> 01:25:27.551
Do you want to get a snack or something?

01:25:32.967 --> 01:25:35.134
No, it's not like a date. It's just...

01:25:35.258 --> 01:25:36.867
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:25:36.967 --> 01:25:38.492
- She's very cute.
- Okay.

01:25:38.592 --> 01:25:41.093
- You see that save?
- I did.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.426
It was breathtaking.

01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:46.593
Should I take that?

01:25:47.342 --> 01:25:49.700
I thought maybe you could get
your dad to sign it for you.

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:51.426
This is a great glove.

01:25:51.717 --> 01:25:55.658
Look, Case, I'm sorry.
I should have told you what was going on.

01:25:55.758 --> 01:25:58.759
I just... I didn't give you enough credit.
You've changed.

01:26:02.092 --> 01:26:03.867
I should probably... go.

01:26:03.967 --> 01:26:06.134
- Yes, go.
- Okay.

01:26:07.133 --> 01:26:09.908
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow. I'll pick you up from practice.

01:26:10.008 --> 01:26:12.075
Okay. See you tomorrow.

01:26:12.175 --> 01:26:14.759
- Hey. Sorry for the wait.
- Hey. That was incredible.

01:26:14.883 --> 01:26:17.242
So... a bunch of kids
are going over to Pinheads.

01:26:17.342 --> 01:26:20.093
- Do you want to go hang out?
- Yeah.

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.658
- It's like a sauna out here.
- Oh, man.

01:26:33.758 --> 01:26:35.825
Goddamn, I did not think
it was going to be this cold.

01:26:35.925 --> 01:26:37.700
I know.

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.301
Is it just me or is it colder
than elephant dick?

01:26:40.592 --> 01:26:43.759
It's colder than a penguin
humping a popsicle.

01:26:43.883 --> 01:26:45.759
How would you know?

01:26:46.675 --> 01:26:49.801
When's Casey going to show up, man?
I'm freaking freezing.

01:26:52.175 --> 01:26:54.676
- Hey, Casey!
- Hey, guys.

01:26:56.592 --> 01:26:58.658
- What's up, man?
- I thought you guys said 9:00.

01:26:58.758 --> 01:27:00.259
No, no.

01:27:00.383 --> 01:27:03.593
- Oh, man, it's cold.
- I know, right?

01:27:06.217 --> 01:27:07.867
I still can't believe we did that.

01:27:07.967 --> 01:27:11.242
- I still can't believe no one died.
- Well, it was... close.

01:27:11.342 --> 01:27:14.301
Hey, take it easy.

01:27:15.842 --> 01:27:17.575
How you feeling, by the way?

01:27:17.675 --> 01:27:19.926
I'm still waiting for everything to just

01:27:20.050 --> 01:27:23.533
drop back down,
like it's supposed to, you know.

01:27:23.633 --> 01:27:27.093
So, boys...
what's our next big adventure?

01:27:27.258 --> 01:27:29.968
I'll tell you what, man.
If it doesn't involve a beach

01:27:30.092 --> 01:27:32.426
and broads in bikinis, I'm out.

01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:35.992
We could take some snowmobiles out there,
and go to the North Pole or something.

01:27:36.092 --> 01:27:37.301
Easy. Easy, easy, easy.

01:27:37.425 --> 01:27:39.992
Man, if I took my dad's snowmobile,
he would disown me.

01:27:40.092 --> 01:27:42.926
- Yeah, he loves that thing.
- More than me.

01:28:04.342 --> 01:28:06.092
Let's go to Pinheads, man. This sucks.

01:28:06.192 --> 01:28:10.576
- Pinheads? I'm down with pinheads.
- Let's go.
