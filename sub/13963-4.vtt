Ava, you're gonna be
a massive cabaret star.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.325
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, guys.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.577
This--this guy could be
total bullshit, honey.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.204
I mean, he might just be
trying to get laid.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.456
So it's not my voice,
it's my ass?

00:39.456 --> 00:41.041
No, I'm--I'm--
that's not what I'm saying.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.334
He's just worried...

00:42.334 --> 00:44.002
And jealous.
(laughter)

00:44.002 --> 00:45.796
No, no, I'm not; I'm just
looking out for my girl.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.506
This could be big
for you, Ava.

00:47.506 --> 00:48.507
Oh, man, you're gonna get

00:48.507 --> 00:49.925
a shitload of attention.

00:49.925 --> 00:52.177
Yeah, lead singer's
the center of attention.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.429
Yeah, everybody wants to bang
the lead singer.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.139
You remember those days,
Johnny.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.307
-Yes, I do.
-Hey, man,

00:57.307 --> 00:58.600
lead singers get laid.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.227
Jagger doesn't have
a sell-by date.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.187
Mm, sexy till
the day he dies.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.772
Every girl on earth
wants to do him.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.148
Hey, if we ever get married,

01:05.148 --> 01:06.650
I get a "free to (...)
Mick Jagger" card.

01:06.650 --> 01:07.776
(laughs)

01:07.776 --> 01:09.987
I want to hump Joe Perry's hair.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.905
I'm getting a serious
Bonnie Raitt vibe

01:11.905 --> 01:13.615
from Joe Perry these days.

01:13.615 --> 01:14.908
Uh, I'm getting some hot
Bonnie Raitt vibes

01:14.908 --> 01:16.159
from Steven Tyler.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.578
Would you do Steven Tyler?

01:17.578 --> 01:20.414
Dude looks like a lesbian
middle-aged lady.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.457
Plus, think how great he'd be
at picking out scarves.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.042
I don't know,
I feel like both of those guys

01:24.042 --> 01:25.627
are one turquoise bracelet away

01:25.627 --> 01:27.546
from shopping at
Ann Taylor Loft.

01:27.546 --> 01:28.547
Where they run into
Keith Richards

01:28.547 --> 01:30.048
in the hair accessories
section.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.717
Hey, what about
Paul McCartney?

01:31.717 --> 01:33.135
-No.
-Boo.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.803
-I call him "Carol."
-Why?

01:34.803 --> 01:36.346
'Cause he looks like
somebody's grand-aunt.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.639
-Oh.
-(laughs)

01:37.639 --> 01:38.557
Hey, I'd like to do
Taylor Swift,

01:38.557 --> 01:40.225
but just once,
then never call her

01:40.225 --> 01:41.768
and see if she writes
a song about me.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.020
Oh, she'll write a song
about you.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.646
Then she'll pull an Adele

01:44.646 --> 01:46.732
and she'll write an entire
revenge album about you.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.734
Yeah, then she would buy
the apartment next to yours

01:48.734 --> 01:49.693
and leave you
some warm snickerdoodles

01:49.693 --> 01:50.736
on your front step

01:50.736 --> 01:52.529
salted with her own lanky tears.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.989
-Could be a turn-on.
-Good.

01:53.989 --> 01:56.575
Well, then it's your adorable
funeral, baby.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.646
No.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.650
Am I too young for you?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.652
Wha--

02:31.652 --> 02:33.403
No. Why you asking me that?

02:33.403 --> 02:35.822
You sure you don't wish
you were with somebody

02:35.822 --> 02:37.449
closer to your own age,

02:37.449 --> 02:40.410
or somebody with more
experience than me in bed?

02:40.410 --> 02:41.703
Don't be silly.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.580
You're perfect for me.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.249
We're perfect for each other
in or out of bed.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.793
(whispers)
Good answer.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.342
What's this?

02:55.342 --> 02:57.010
It's something
that made me think of you

02:57.010 --> 03:00.347
and our kissing calamities.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.599
-Holy shit.
-Do you like it?

03:02.599 --> 03:03.600
I love it.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.313
You're my Mick Jagger.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.566
You're my Ava Gardner.

03:11.566 --> 03:15.946
You know, Kate Beckinsale
in <i>The Aviator.</i>

03:15.946 --> 03:18.782
Ah, it's just an old
Scorsese movie.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.409
Aw.

03:20.409 --> 03:23.120
I like old movies.

03:27.666 --> 03:30.460
(sighs)

03:30.460 --> 03:32.295
-Is it your birthday?
-Nope.

03:32.295 --> 03:37.050
-Then why'd she give it to you?
-Trying to figure that out.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.387
-It's got diamonds in it.
-And rubies.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.972
What do rubies mean
as, like, a gem?

03:41.972 --> 03:43.640
I googled it.
Commitment.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.059
-Shit. Really?
-I know.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.020
God damn it. There's a ton
of goddamn rubies in it.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.731
FLASH: The whole goddamn
thing's rubies.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.400
(laughs)

03:53.400 --> 03:55.652
You--maybe we're
overthinking it.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.446
Oh, yeah, right.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.030
You heard that marriage crack
she made yesterday.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.198
Look at this.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.616
Remember Phil Tessla?

04:01.616 --> 04:03.577
Just like Mickey,
he dropped dead last night,

04:03.577 --> 04:04.870
but not famous enough
to get his name

04:04.870 --> 04:06.413
to headline his own obituary.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.415
That's gonna be me, man,

04:08.415 --> 04:10.584
'cause I'm never gonna be more
famous than I am right now.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.335
I ain't gettin' any younger.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.588
She gives me this pin
to step up our relationship

04:14.588 --> 04:16.047
to the next level.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.383
So I'm thinking
maybe it's time.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.135
I mean, what the hell
am I waiting for?

04:20.135 --> 04:22.304
I'm gonna meet a girl that's
more suited to my tastes

04:22.304 --> 04:24.639
looks-wise
and age-wise?

04:24.639 --> 04:26.141
No.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.434
Well, I mean,
you could troll

04:27.434 --> 04:28.852
a few local high schools
and colleges.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.061
Funny.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.646
I know you think
I'm too old for her.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.440
You know what? I actually
don't think that anymore.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.441
Oh, since when?

04:34.441 --> 04:35.442
Since I evolved.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.277
I'm changing, okay?

04:37.277 --> 04:38.987
-Oh, you've evolved?
-Yeah. I'm evolving.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.906
I mean, have you not noticed
my new threads?

04:40.906 --> 04:42.908
Yeah, I've noticed that
you're dressing like me.

04:42.908 --> 04:43.909
I'm not dressing like you,
okay?

04:43.909 --> 04:45.368
Ava got me these clothes.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.204
I'm--I'm dressing like this
to make Ava happy.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.538
Okay, that's what
I'm focusing on, all right?

04:48.538 --> 04:49.790
You should be focusing
on that too

04:49.790 --> 04:51.541
because if you put a smile
on Gigi's face,

04:51.541 --> 04:53.043
that puts a smile
on Ava's face,

04:53.043 --> 04:55.003
and that makes my life
a hell of a lot easier.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.214
Oh, okay,
so it is still about you?

04:57.214 --> 04:59.883
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.511
It's all about you
taking care of Gigi.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.012
But don't do anything insane

05:04.012 --> 05:06.306
because this is not the most
famous you're gonna be.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.808
When she gets famous,
which she will

05:07.808 --> 05:10.477
because she's beautiful
and talented and ambitious,

05:10.477 --> 05:12.979
you're gonna get more famous
for being her guitar player,

05:12.979 --> 05:15.440
and I'm gonna get famous
for being her songwriting dad.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.317
Okay?
So hold out a little bit longer

05:17.317 --> 05:19.736
and there'll be, like, a gaggle
of 23-year-old girls

05:19.736 --> 05:23.240
just dying to buy
whatever you have to sell.

05:23.240 --> 05:27.494
But not too long, 'cause, you
know, your hair is disappearing.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.329
Dude, is there something
wrong with you?

05:29.329 --> 05:30.664
What do you mean?

05:30.664 --> 05:32.249
How can you talk about
your daughter like that?

05:32.249 --> 05:34.376
-Like what?
-Like she's a record deal.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.461
-That's not what I said.
-Oh, yeah, it is.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.630
And listen, number one, my
hair's not receding that fast.

05:38.630 --> 05:41.299
Number two, the gray makes it
look a little wispy.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.634
-Okay.
-Number three,

05:42.634 --> 05:44.678
Gigi's happiness
is my main concern

05:44.678 --> 05:47.848
so when we have lunch today
with that cabaret producer,

05:47.848 --> 05:50.058
see if you can keep "evolving."

05:50.058 --> 05:51.601
I know how to use a napkin,
asshole.

05:51.601 --> 05:52.644
You know how
to keep your yap shut

05:52.644 --> 05:55.564
and let Ava do all the talking?

05:55.564 --> 05:57.691
Ooh.
I can almost hear

05:57.691 --> 05:59.359
your DNA imploding
right now.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.485
My DNA is not--

06:00.485 --> 06:02.612
this is my (...) you,
Flash face.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.698
That's what this face is.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.414
From the first time
I saw The Heathens live,

06:12.414 --> 06:14.249
I swear to God,
I was a huge fan.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.334
It was the--
it was the Ritz in '92.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.752
Man, I thought you guys
were gonna win

06:17.752 --> 06:19.462
the Best New Artist Grammy
that year

06:19.462 --> 06:21.673
and the MTV Moonman
and an AMA.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.717
Shit, I thought you guys were
gonna sweep the whole thing.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.344
Yeah, no, they broke up
before the nominations came out.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.305
Who did end up winning
the Grammy that year?

06:28.305 --> 06:29.681
Marc Cohn.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.850
With this--this crappy,
little piano ballad

06:31.850 --> 06:33.268
about Elvis' ghost
or some shit.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.269
"Walking in Memphis."

06:34.269 --> 06:35.604
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.272
I won a producing Grammy
that night too,

06:37.272 --> 06:40.692
so that song has a--it has
a special place in my heart.

06:40.692 --> 06:43.445
Marc, you know, he ended up
being a one-hit wonder,

06:43.445 --> 06:45.071
it happens,
but you guys, man,

06:45.071 --> 06:46.656
I thought you guys
had staying power.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.034
I always wondered what happened
after you broke up.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.453
Well, I, you know, wanted
to do something that was more

06:51.453 --> 06:52.954
purely my own vision.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.873
So I-I started this band called
The Johnny Rock Show,

06:54.873 --> 06:56.875
you probably heard about them.
Very highly acclaimed--

06:56.875 --> 06:58.710
I-I remember
The Johnny Rock show.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.712
I meant what happened
with you, Ava?

07:00.712 --> 07:04.424
You had such charisma.
And your eyes--holy shit.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.718
I could never stop staring at
you when you were on stage.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.387
I just--I kept waiting for you
to do your own thing.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.014
-Well, I--
-Well, she was kind of tenta--

07:11.014 --> 07:13.099
you felt tentative
about stepping out front,

07:13.099 --> 07:14.267
right, honey?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.518
No, no.
I wouldn't say tentative.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.020
I would say more stuck
in the background.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.439
Yeah, she crushed it
with me last week.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.066
That's the video
I showed you.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.317
-Her voice is better than ever.
-I know, right?

07:22.317 --> 07:24.361
It's even sexier now.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.113
It's--it's deeper. I--man--
I-I'm in love with your tone.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.531
Oh, thank you, Brook.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.991
Let me cut right
to the point here.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.910
I am bringing cabaret
to Brooklyn.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.954
I think there's a market here
for upscale, yet edgy live music

07:34.954 --> 07:36.331
in a theatrical setting.

07:36.331 --> 07:39.250
Debbie Harry is my opening
weekend headliner.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.670
The following Wednesday
and Thursday

07:41.670 --> 07:44.714
would be you, Ava X.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.342
Me and Debbie Harry?

07:47.342 --> 07:48.343
-(laughs)
-That's right.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.844
Think you can handle it?

07:49.844 --> 07:51.346
-Well, yeah, I think I--
-You know what?

07:51.346 --> 07:52.931
I-I can handle it.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.474
I'll--I'll be
your music director.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.559
I'll pick out the songs.
We'll make the set list.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.602
Come up with a title
and all that stuff

07:57.602 --> 07:58.770
that we're gonna need.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.105
You just worry about singing

08:00.105 --> 08:01.314
and I'll handle
everything else.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.816
Except the check.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.526
We, uh--we have
an old-standing rule:

08:04.526 --> 08:06.361
Grammy winner
picks up the check.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.446
-Five-time Grammy winner.
-Sorry?

08:08.446 --> 08:09.906
You won five Grammys?

08:09.906 --> 08:10.907
I did. Yeah.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.534
No, well, six, actually.

08:12.534 --> 08:16.329
I keep forgetting about
the Michael J. Fox audiobook.

08:16.329 --> 08:20.250
And those count?

08:20.250 --> 08:22.127
I don't know.

08:27.132 --> 08:30.260
♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

08:30.260 --> 08:32.345
(humming indistinctly)

08:32.345 --> 08:34.681
♪ Hey, hey ♪

08:34.681 --> 08:36.349
♪ Hey ♪

08:43.690 --> 08:48.611
I find that coloring
focuses the mind

08:48.611 --> 08:50.572
on forgiveness.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.073
(sighs)

08:52.073 --> 08:54.075
It's peaceful, cleansing.

08:54.075 --> 08:57.912
Transforms the sin-addled
adult soul

08:57.912 --> 09:01.458
into that of
an innocent child.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.709
Okay.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.085
The unicorn's mane may be

09:04.085 --> 09:06.254
the most important piece
of the picture.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.423
What color should it be?

09:08.423 --> 09:12.177
Atomic Tangerine

09:12.177 --> 09:13.887
or Unmellow Yellow?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.643
Razzle-dazzle Rose.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.644
Right here.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.271
Niece, two nephews.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.315
Yeah, Purple Pizzazz, too busy.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.442
And it's not really purple,
if you ask me.

09:27.442 --> 09:28.860
Purple Pizzazz is hot magenta

09:28.860 --> 09:30.737
on some strange violet mission.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.740
Yeah. Trying to steal
Razzle-dazzle Rose's thunder.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.506
What's your favorite shade
of purple, Mr. Silverstein?

09:49.506 --> 09:53.259
Puce.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.846
Puce is a...

09:56.846 --> 09:59.224
very angry color.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.101
Well, it depends on
how you say it.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.811
Puce.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.271
Are you saying when I say it,
I say it angry?

10:05.271 --> 10:07.023
Yes.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.024
Puce.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.234
Puce.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.027
-Puce.
-Puce.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.237
Like me.
Puce.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.905
Puce.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.658
You're kind of only
saying it lower and slower.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.618
Puce.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.078
Puce.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.204
-Puce.
-Puce.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.205
-Puce.
-Puce?

10:22.205 --> 10:23.581
Relax your larynx a little.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.083
Just, like, let it
fly out of you.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.126
You know, puce.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.127
Puce?

10:27.127 --> 10:29.921
Still sounds mad.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.464
-Puce.
-(...) puce!

10:31.464 --> 10:33.049
"Puce" sounds like "puke."

10:33.049 --> 10:35.093
Not even in the (...)
purple family.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.137
It's a little maggot color.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.055
Doesn't have the balls
to be pink.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.015
The courage to be (...) purple.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.433
Puce is a pussy.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.060
"Pussy Puce," that should be
the Crayola name.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.271
There will be no puce
in the show.

10:46.271 --> 10:49.315
(exhales slowly)

10:52.026 --> 10:53.987
Can I ask you a question?

10:53.987 --> 10:54.988
Color question?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.990
No, this is a show question.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.117
Uh, do you sing?

10:59.117 --> 11:02.829
Well, I've done some
Shakespeare--13 productions--

11:02.829 --> 11:04.998
and what is Shakespeare,
if not singing?

11:04.998 --> 11:09.043
What is "Hamlet" three times,
if not pure music?

11:09.043 --> 11:10.587
You never heard
my Haagen-Dazs commercials?

11:10.587 --> 11:12.505
Mesmerizing.
I've seen them.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.257
You had me hooked on
Vanilla Swiss Almond

11:14.257 --> 11:16.384
for two and a half
delicious years.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.594
(laughs)

11:20.972 --> 11:23.808
So you're gonna talk/sing
29 of my songs

11:23.808 --> 11:25.894
about the potato famine?

11:25.894 --> 11:27.645
No.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.522
No, I'm gonna talk/sing
five of your songs.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.482
I'm dropping 24 of them

11:31.482 --> 11:34.235
and bringing in a new young
composer because I want to rap.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.236
Rap?

11:35.236 --> 11:36.696
What, like, hip-hop rap?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.990
I want to rap
the Irish famine

11:38.990 --> 11:40.950
into the minds of upcoming
generations.

11:40.950 --> 11:45.121
I want to drop some rhymes
on young Irish minds.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.248
Drop the top on the spot

11:47.248 --> 11:50.043
where the English
dropped dimes.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.003
Kill the chill on the hill

11:52.003 --> 11:54.631
where my tribe's blood
was spilt.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.925
Hit the kit on the kettle
where the battle be settled.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.510
This is it, bro,
let the blood flow.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.054
Take the bit, bitch.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.889
Hit the hot Celtic switch.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.682
Uh, uh-uh.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.601
Whoo!
What?

12:06.601 --> 12:08.478
D--dude.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.271
That was amazing, Campbell.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.606
Thanks, man.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.733
-W--can I say "Campbell"?
-Yeah.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.026
What--dude.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.903
I'm working a heavy
Kendrick vibe,

12:16.903 --> 12:18.947
like, 24/7 these days.

12:18.947 --> 12:23.993
Uh, my show is not
some crappy rap thing, man.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.746
It is a song cycle.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.081
It's my show.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.959
You gave over the rights
to my company

12:30.959 --> 12:33.253
when you signed the contract,
Mr. Silverstein.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.547
And my show is gonna feast on
"Hamilton's" testicles.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.550
My show is gonna make
America forget

12:39.550 --> 12:42.929
about Ha-ha-Hamilton.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.807
My show will be referred to
as "Familton."

12:45.807 --> 12:47.225
Your subject is powerful,

12:47.225 --> 12:50.812
but your songs are out of date
and atonal.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.647
The real genius
is this man's drumming.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.857
That was the best thing about
those 29 tracks.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.277
I want wall-to-wall percussion
in "Feast."

12:57.277 --> 13:00.989
I want ancient Celtic
tribal drums--

13:00.989 --> 13:02.991
bodhrán meets--

13:02.991 --> 13:05.535
I don't know--
the beats of Dr. (...) Dre.

13:05.535 --> 13:08.079
Yeah, that's--
that's genius, man.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.914
Right?
Smashing it.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.958
-Punching it. Popping it.
-Yeah.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.251
Look, Campbell,

13:13.251 --> 13:16.546
I was willing to collaborate...

13:16.546 --> 13:21.050
but I mean, I have got to
draw the line

13:21.050 --> 13:23.970
at having a 54-year-old
white guy...

13:23.970 --> 13:25.013
51.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.890
REHAB:
Standing on stage rapping.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.017
It's not cool!

13:29.017 --> 13:30.351
I mean, it's not Celtic.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.729
-I got news for you, my friend.
-What?

13:32.729 --> 13:37.275
I am the American theater
Celtic barometer of cool.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.901
By the time I get finished
with "Feast,"

13:38.901 --> 13:40.486
people are gonna be begging me

13:40.486 --> 13:42.363
to autograph
their (...) potatoes.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.949
Well, then you can sign
potatoes by yourself, man.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.368
You may have the right
to destroy my masterwork,

13:47.368 --> 13:48.953
Mr. Scott,

13:48.953 --> 13:52.957
but we have the right
to walk away.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.168
Come on, Bam.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.377
Um...

13:56.377 --> 13:58.337
I, uh...

13:58.337 --> 14:00.131
I'm staying with Campbell.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.008
REHAB: (sighs)

14:02.008 --> 14:03.926
Well, then,
I'm taking my name

14:03.926 --> 14:05.553
off of his show.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.937
What color should
the wings be?

14:14.937 --> 14:15.897
Not puce.

14:20.985 --> 14:21.778
All right,
so listen, girls.

14:21.778 --> 14:22.779
Listen.
Hey.

14:22.779 --> 14:23.821
(indistinct chatter)

14:23.821 --> 14:24.906
I've got the idea for the--

14:24.906 --> 14:25.823
Hey. Shh.
Hey.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.575
Guys, listen.

14:27.575 --> 14:28.868
Great idea for the opening tune.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.453
"Bang a Gong," T-Rex,

14:30.453 --> 14:32.622
honey, that's one of your
favorite songs ever recorded,

14:32.622 --> 14:33.873
okay, plus it's got
a sexy groove.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.999
I've never seen a chick
cover it,

14:34.999 --> 14:37.543
but it also gives us
the title of our show:

14:37.543 --> 14:41.756
Ava X Hubcap,
Diamond Star, Halo.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.758
Yawn.
No.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.927
My foot literally just fell
asleep as you were saying it.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.804
Same song, better title--
"Get It On."

14:47.804 --> 14:48.971
AVA: "Get It On."

14:48.971 --> 14:49.889
-Right?
-It's awesome.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.849
Oh, my God. "Get It On."

14:51.849 --> 14:53.017
If I see a poster with her
silhouette in stiletto heels,

14:53.017 --> 14:54.894
that says "Ava X Get It On,"

14:54.894 --> 14:56.771
I'm showing up, not to mention
every penis in Brooklyn.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.106
Okay, but "Get It On's"
not classy.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.149
"Hubcap, Diamond Star,
Halo," that's classy.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.776
We don't need a classy title,
okay?

15:01.776 --> 15:02.985
I'm classy.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.529
We need asses in the seats.

15:04.529 --> 15:05.905
And some really killer shoes.

15:05.905 --> 15:06.948
-Absolutely.
-For sure.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.574
GIGI: "Get It On" is the title,

15:08.574 --> 15:10.159
but you don't open
with that song, okay,

15:10.159 --> 15:11.869
you close with it, because when
people hear "Get It On,"

15:11.869 --> 15:13.704
they're gonna thing
"Bang a Gong."

15:13.704 --> 15:14.956
So subconsciously
they're gonna be begging for it.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.958
So we make them wait

15:16.958 --> 15:18.084
and then we give it to them
at the end, make them orgasm.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.794
Okay, so let me just
get this straight.

15:19.794 --> 15:22.463
Um, I've got 32 years
of show business experience,

15:22.463 --> 15:24.882
but you're gonna tell me
how to put a set together?

15:24.882 --> 15:26.050
-Yes. I am.
-Okay.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.760
Okay, we open with
an original tune

15:27.760 --> 15:29.011
so we can establish original
ground right up front.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.221
You know, something
with a sexy groove.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.806
-Yes.
-Okay, honey,

15:31.806 --> 15:33.141
who's the musical director here?

15:33.141 --> 15:34.684
-I am.
-Gigi is.

15:34.684 --> 15:35.935
You're just the piano player,
honey.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.813
-Since when?
-Since the cab ride home.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.148
I was in the cab, okay,

15:40.148 --> 15:41.732
and I was talking to you guys
about, you know,

15:41.732 --> 15:42.900
who I was gonna hire
for the horn section,

15:42.900 --> 15:44.360
and you guys
weren't even listening.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.611
You were both just sitting
there, texting.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.821
Yes, each other,

15:46.821 --> 15:48.114
making really big decisions.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.116
W-why is she in charge?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.742
Because I'm the only member of
the band that's not on stage,

15:51.742 --> 15:53.578
plus, I have great ideas,
great perspective.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.121
Well, "Bang a Gong"
was my idea.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.205
Yeah, which I just
made better.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.331
It's a collaboration, Dad.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.541
That's what I'm saying.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.792
I want to collaborate--
me and you.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.002
Me and Ava,

16:01.002 --> 16:02.837
but you shouldn't worry
about that.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.630
You should just be worrying
about your piano chops.

16:04.630 --> 16:08.676
What's wrong with
my piano chops?

16:08.676 --> 16:10.511
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.679
-And so for sure on the belt.
-I like the first one.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.764
AVA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do too.
I do too.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.305
-Very nice.
-All right.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.765
-Whoo!
-Nice.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.516
-Way to go, hon.
-Thanks, guys.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.643
-That was awesome.
-Yeah, you too, man.

16:58.643 --> 16:59.977
(clears throat)
Dad.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.395
-Yeah?
-You want to walk out together?

17:01.395 --> 17:02.813
I want to discuss
some of the songs.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.315
Oh, okay. Great.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.733
Hope you guys are whispering
about coming in earlier

17:05.733 --> 17:07.151
on the second verse over there.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.778
Don't have to come in earlier

17:08.778 --> 17:10.655
if you ain't ham-fisting
them keys, kid.

17:10.655 --> 17:11.948
Yeah, you got heavy fingers.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.950
-And happy mother(...) feet.
-Uh-huh.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.160
Always did.
You got no nuance.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.745
Try listening to us,

17:17.745 --> 17:19.038
'cause we're listening
to the lead singer.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.831
Slow the heck down, man.

17:20.831 --> 17:22.333
Yeah, or you guys
could just come in earlier

17:22.333 --> 17:23.751
on the second verse.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.295
Thanks for the advice, boys.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.839
I oughta kick his (...) ass.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.883
Ah. What's up?

17:30.883 --> 17:33.219
-Why are you acting like this?
-Like what?

17:33.219 --> 17:34.428
You're being awful.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.097
You're acting like a--
like a yappy,

17:36.097 --> 17:38.349
loudmouth, insecure
little douche,

17:38.349 --> 17:40.560
which I know is normal for you,
but my God,

17:40.560 --> 17:42.562
it's like you turned the volume
on the bitch knob up to 11.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.813
Yeah, okay.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.231
Why can't you be happy
for Ava?

17:45.231 --> 17:46.857
I am happy for Ava.
I'm just--

17:46.857 --> 17:48.442
-No, you're not.
-Yeah, I'm just concerned.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.485
You know, I don't want her
to get hurt

17:49.485 --> 17:51.195
-or upset.
-Or famous.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.738
Oh, honey,
she's not gonna get famous.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.657
-This is one goddamn gig.
-What if she does?

17:54.657 --> 17:55.741
What if she does?
What if something happens

17:55.741 --> 17:56.993
and she becomes
kind of well-known?

17:56.993 --> 17:58.786
-What then?
-I--

17:58.786 --> 18:00.871
God, if you get this jealous
and agitated over one gig

18:00.871 --> 18:03.499
of Ava's what is gonna happen
if I make it?

18:03.499 --> 18:05.668
Honey, I'm, like,
your biggest fan.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.128
Nobody wants you to make it
more than me.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.754
But then why can't you be
Ava's biggest fan?

18:08.754 --> 18:09.630
What are you afraid of?

18:09.630 --> 18:10.965
I'm not afraid of anything.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.466
You're afraid she might
leave you.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.218
Oh, yeah, like
she's gonna leave me.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.636
Honey, you have to understand
something, okay,

18:15.636 --> 18:16.554
we're soul mates, all right.

18:16.554 --> 18:17.722
We're attached at the hip.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.307
Together forever.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.641
She's never gonna leave me.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.351
(scoffs)

18:22.351 --> 18:25.438
W-why, did she say
something about... leaving?

18:25.438 --> 18:28.774
What did she say?

18:28.774 --> 18:31.736
(sighs)

18:31.736 --> 18:33.738
Well, we had a long talk
about leaving.

18:33.738 --> 18:34.739
And?

18:34.739 --> 18:37.533
And she's not leaving,

18:37.533 --> 18:38.534
you are.

18:38.534 --> 18:39.619
What do you mean?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.912
You're fired, Dad.

18:41.912 --> 18:42.955
Fired from what?

18:42.955 --> 18:43.956
You're fired from the band.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.041
You're fired from Ava X.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.542
-Says who?
-Says Ava.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.877
Says me.
Says Ruck. Says Bam Bam.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.211
Says everybody,
but especially me.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.212
Okay, that's bullshit.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.672
Why didn't Ava tell me?

18:51.672 --> 18:53.633
'Cause she's completely
overwhelmed by you.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.009
She feels like you're trying
to subconsciously sabotage her.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.552
I'm not trying to--

18:56.552 --> 18:57.928
We know you have heavy
fingers, but (...), Dad.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.514
You're like an anchor
just weighing her down.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.724
It's such a drag

19:01.724 --> 19:04.018
and everybody feels it.

19:04.018 --> 19:06.646
I'm sorry to say this, but
if you have any song ideas,

19:06.646 --> 19:08.648
if you have any suggestions,
you have to go through me first.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.940
Honey--

19:09.940 --> 19:11.484
I don't want you
on stage with her.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.485
You're messing her up.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.736
You're bringing her down.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.696
You are never stepping foot
on that stage, ever.

19:15.696 --> 19:16.697
Okay, I'm not--
I'm not--

19:16.697 --> 19:18.157
Shh!
Listen.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.284
If you have any brains left,
you will go home,

19:20.284 --> 19:22.078
you will apologize to her,
okay,

19:22.078 --> 19:23.746
and you will agree
to step elegantly aside

19:23.746 --> 19:26.666
while she has her time
in the spotlight.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.793
She'll love you for it.

19:30.586 --> 19:31.587
(scoffs)

19:36.050 --> 19:38.344
I want a bagel.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.477
Hey, what the (...)?

19:46.477 --> 19:47.770
Don't want to discuss it,
John.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.438
You don't want to discuss it?

19:49.438 --> 19:50.690
You fire me from the band
without telling me

19:50.690 --> 19:52.358
and you don't want to
discuss it?

19:52.358 --> 19:53.818
We're gonna discuss the shit
out of it right now.

19:53.818 --> 19:58.531
Do not get in that bed, Ava.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.951
We are gonna--

20:01.951 --> 20:03.661
Ava.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.204
Okay.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.247
All right.

20:06.247 --> 20:10.292
Now listen to me.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.753
Do not pick up that--

20:12.753 --> 20:15.923
Don't open that iPad.
Honey.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.300
(growls)

20:18.300 --> 20:20.094
Okay.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.971
I know I'm controlling

20:21.971 --> 20:24.807
and I probably express myself
the wrong way sometimes,

20:24.807 --> 20:27.435
but what I'm trying to say,
honey, is,

20:27.435 --> 20:29.562
I have the same interest here
that you do.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.147
I-I have your best interest
at heart.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.565
What's best for me, John,

20:32.565 --> 20:34.442
is to not have you sitting
behind me on opening night.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.819
-Why?
-Because.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.946
-That's it?
-Yeah.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.240
That's it.
"Because."

20:41.240 --> 20:43.075
Because I have enough
to worry about, okay?

20:43.075 --> 20:45.619
How I sound, how I look, what
the audience is thinking of me,

20:45.619 --> 20:47.580
how to keep my hands
from shaking.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.790
This is not about you this time.
This is about me.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.500
But that's what I'm saying.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.753
We're saying the same thing.
Honey.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.922
I want to be there for
precisely those reasons, okay.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.216
I want to be there in case
you have a panic attack

20:59.216 --> 21:00.384
or you get anxious.

21:00.384 --> 21:01.427
All you have to do
is look over at me

21:01.427 --> 21:03.053
and there I am to support you,

21:03.053 --> 21:05.473
to help you breathe, okay.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.141
I'm--I want to be
your safety net.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.976
Okay, in case you fall apart,

21:08.976 --> 21:12.188
I'm there to put the pieces
back together again.

21:15.941 --> 21:19.570
But what if I don't
fall apart?

21:19.570 --> 21:21.071
What if?

21:21.071 --> 21:23.407
What if I'm great?

21:26.410 --> 21:27.453
But what if you're not?

21:27.453 --> 21:29.038
-Oh, you stupid...
-Ow! Jeez!

21:29.038 --> 21:30.498
Son of a bitch!

21:30.498 --> 21:31.791
You've been doing this
all week, John,

21:31.791 --> 21:33.417
mind (...)ing me into failing.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.335
-Get out!
-That hurt.

21:34.335 --> 21:35.878
I don't care. Get out!
