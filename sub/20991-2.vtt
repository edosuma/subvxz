00:43.840 --> 00:46.200
- Did you know him ?
- No.

00:47.560 --> 00:51.240
- What about Daniel ?
- Maybe. I don't know.

00:57.719 --> 00:59.640
Abraham. What does it mean ?

01:08.959 --> 01:12.640
Why ? Why did Daniel
want us to see that ?

01:17.599 --> 01:18.640
I have no idea.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.719
PAKT
Episode 2

02:48.960 --> 02:49.879
Hang on.

03:08.319 --> 03:12.879
I can't stand it any longer.
I can't stand thinking about it.

03:17.159 --> 03:18.599
Why did he do that to us ?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.280
If you want, I'll talk to him.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.800
No, thanks.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.759
Bye.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.280
- You're dating him.
- No.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.159
If you'll listen to me...

04:09.240 --> 04:12.039
That prick's to blame
for Dad's death.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.319
You don't understand anything.

04:14.759 --> 04:17.079
No, I bloody don't.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.079
Look, I've really had an awful day...

04:23.519 --> 04:26.079
You got so tired
at the cinema or café ?

05:37.879 --> 05:40.120
Thank you. Good night.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.720
May I come in ?

06:42.680 --> 06:45.240
I need your help.
I can't open this.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.399
Have you tried inserting it
into a narrow port in your laptop ?

06:50.480 --> 06:52.560
Weronika, I really need to open this.

06:54.399 --> 06:56.959
Long time no see.
I don't do it anymore, Piotr.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.120
It's very important to me.

07:10.839 --> 07:13.120
- It's from Daniel, you know ?
- I told you.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.360
So you won't help me ?

07:25.680 --> 07:26.600
I'm sorry.

08:03.920 --> 08:04.920
Thanks.

08:05.800 --> 08:09.319
... Adrian Boguszstarted his daily
practice around 3 p.m.

08:09.399 --> 08:13.079
He was a fan of car racing.
He knew this area perfectly well

08:13.160 --> 08:15.759
because it was his regular
practice route.

08:15.839 --> 08:18.399
Today, he drove off the route
and hit a tree,

08:18.480 --> 08:19.920
while his car exploded.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.279
Bogusz died on the spot.
Now, criminal forensic experts

08:23.360 --> 08:26.600
are trying to find out
why did he lose control of his car ?

08:26.680 --> 08:27.839
Let's talk.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.560
What ? Did a manhole
in Marszałkowska give way ?

08:41.879 --> 08:43.919
- What's up ?
- It was no accident.

08:44.559 --> 08:47.480
Bogusz ? People say he often
practised in that area.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.200
- Someone knew he'd do it.
- What ?

08:50.279 --> 08:53.639
- It must have been planned.
- What do you mean ?

08:53.720 --> 08:56.879
It's not only about Bogusz.
It's linked to Daniel too.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.240
You don't believe me ?

08:58.799 --> 09:02.279
We've been in court for months
and may end up jobless.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.960
And now you're out
with something like that.

09:05.039 --> 09:07.440
Put me on this story.
You won't regret it.

09:07.519 --> 09:08.600
No.

09:08.679 --> 09:11.159
A few fucking hours ago
you wanted me back !

09:11.240 --> 09:14.480
But not on Daniel's story.
I'm no longer in charge here.

09:14.559 --> 09:18.000
Where did Monika find the document
incriminating Bogusz ?

09:18.080 --> 09:20.240
It's bullshit someone sends her.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.799
Someone knew he'd be there
and he'd crash.

09:22.879 --> 09:24.600
It's been set up
for a long time.

09:26.279 --> 09:27.840
And how come you know that ?

09:37.679 --> 09:41.080
I'd better be here for a reason.
Go on.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.360
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:47.320 --> 09:51.000
Piotr has certain information
that changes our attitude to...

09:51.080 --> 09:53.320
- To what exactly ?
- It's about Bogusz.

09:53.399 --> 09:56.440
It wasn't an accident.
Someone made him kill himself.

09:57.039 --> 10:00.799
- Who ?
- Just let me finish, all right ?

10:01.639 --> 10:04.559
It was carefully planned
probably a long time ago.

10:04.639 --> 10:06.600
- What evidence do you have?
- I do.

10:06.679 --> 10:07.679
What is it ?

10:09.960 --> 10:13.399
Someone must have made
a threat to him so he killed himself.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.799
Are you writing it down ?

10:16.440 --> 10:17.799
His exact words.

10:17.879 --> 10:21.200
"Harassed, threatened,
killed himself".

10:21.639 --> 10:23.399
Add: "suicide" and "Grodecki".

10:24.919 --> 10:27.240
Any of these words
is printed tomorrow

10:27.320 --> 10:30.480
and all of you can look
for a new job. Is that clear ?

10:30.559 --> 10:32.879
You don't even fucking let me finish...

10:32.960 --> 10:35.559
You know the sales results ?
Can you tell him ?

10:35.639 --> 10:38.519
They dropped by nine percentin
the last quarter.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.399
The future doesn't look good.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.360
We're still in court
for harassing your brother !

10:43.440 --> 10:45.639
You want to ruin us ?
Is this your plan ?

10:45.720 --> 10:48.519
I want all of the employees,
present and absent,

10:48.600 --> 10:51.679
to understand one thing:
Bogusz died in an accident.

10:51.759 --> 10:54.240
So why don't you go
and print an obituary ?!

10:54.320 --> 10:57.120
But you can gain more
on what I have for you.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.159
And what the fuck is that ?
Tell me: what is that ?

11:00.720 --> 11:04.200
Another conspiracy theory ?
Go to the Internet, start a blog.

11:05.759 --> 11:10.200
- Who gave you the tip on Bogusz ?
- Piotr, these are my sources.

11:10.279 --> 11:14.080
You contacted them only online,
by mail and chat rooms, correct ?

11:14.159 --> 11:17.399
I check my informers.
Unlike you.

11:17.480 --> 11:21.000
- So tell me their names !
- They are from Bogusz's company.

11:21.080 --> 11:25.440
- All of them are checked !
- I checked them.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.360
And none of them was Sara.

11:29.440 --> 11:33.639
Shut up ! I'm telling you,
the last year repeats itself.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.879
Yeah... Someone killed
himself because of you again ?

11:36.960 --> 11:38.240
Shut the fuck up !

11:38.320 --> 11:40.879
- What are you doing anyway ?
- Enough, enough !

11:44.639 --> 11:47.600
To sum up: Bogusz died
in an accident and that's it.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.000
I think we should let Piotr
write his article.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.679
He can cool down,

11:53.759 --> 11:56.200
present his arguments
in a rational way.

11:56.279 --> 11:58.320
- Then we'll decide.
- You won't.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.879
- Sorry ?
- You won't run it anyway.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.480
Hi, can we meet today ?

12:16.240 --> 12:19.720
Tomorrow will be too late.
Neither at my work nor at yours.

12:20.159 --> 12:23.320
Somewhere in the city centre.
Fine.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.600
Pull up, please.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.960
We shouldn't meet for now.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.279
So you're leaving me alone
with all this.

14:03.879 --> 14:04.919
No.

14:08.279 --> 14:10.399
- It will be better this way.
- For whom ?

14:11.240 --> 14:12.320
For us.

14:13.639 --> 14:14.639
Really.

14:17.399 --> 14:18.519
How long ?

14:20.840 --> 14:25.159
A few weeks.
And then someone will call you.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.120
- What am I to do ?
- Nothing.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.799
No interviews. All right ?

14:36.759 --> 14:38.639
Not a word to reporters.
Nothing.

14:41.519 --> 14:43.399
We both have too much
to lose now.

14:44.039 --> 14:47.200
Sure. You're the one
to set rules here.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.519
- Why ?
- It's just my whim.

15:07.600 --> 15:11.240
Your people won't take it ?
Is it some dodgy deal ?

15:12.840 --> 15:15.600
What if it is ? Would it be
a problem for your paper ?

15:16.480 --> 15:20.679
None. The linage will be impressive.
I'll share it with you.

15:20.759 --> 15:22.759
- I don't want it.
- Sure ?

15:25.279 --> 15:27.840
If Kurier finds out,
you'll need every penny.

15:28.480 --> 15:31.120
What difference does it make ?
I'm dead anyway.

17:09.640 --> 17:10.759
Mother fucker.

17:12.480 --> 17:13.480
He's out.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.440
What makes you so sure
it was him ?

17:16.519 --> 17:19.759
I know you're idealistic but forget
about your ideals.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.720
He sold us and has to pay for that.

17:21.799 --> 17:25.640
So our next front page will show
a silly affair and lots of details,

17:25.720 --> 17:27.759
all the positions,
how many times.

17:27.839 --> 17:31.079
- But why exactly ?
- To divert people from this rubbish.

17:31.160 --> 17:34.519
He killed himself because
of his wife's affair and not us.

17:34.599 --> 17:37.359
So we're not interested
what really happened.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.599
We really should be interested in
is the number of ads.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.440
Jelly wrestling will help us
get better sales ?

17:43.519 --> 17:45.000
You're learning quickly.

17:48.640 --> 17:49.839
Monika, any doubts ?

17:53.440 --> 17:58.319
I think we should go to the hoteland
find out who needed Skalski's pics.

17:59.039 --> 18:01.759
What for ?
We have a story ready to run.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.319
OK, go there and check it.
Be ready by six.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.319
I'm the one to arrange it.

18:13.079 --> 18:15.839
- She doesn't report to you.
- She's in my section.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.599
But all the sections are mine.

18:38.279 --> 18:39.200
Yes ?

18:39.599 --> 18:42.599
Piotr Grodecki from Kurier.
I'd like to talk to you.

18:43.559 --> 18:45.200
I've got nothing to tell you.

18:54.759 --> 18:55.839
You want money.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.319
No. I wanted to talk
about your husband's death.

19:01.319 --> 19:04.839
Forgive me but the police
forbade me to discuss it.

19:05.960 --> 19:11.680
- They never say so.
- But I do. Please leave.

19:21.039 --> 19:22.039
I was there.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.440
- Sorry ?
- I saw his accident.

19:32.599 --> 19:36.119
I have to know why it happened,
why your husband is dead.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.839
Just like you said:
it was simply an accident.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.440
You remember
the case of Daniel Grodecki ?

19:48.519 --> 19:51.640
- What does it have to do with that ?
- He was my brother.

20:13.359 --> 20:16.160
For a long time, Adrian...

20:19.160 --> 20:20.559
I don't know how to put it.

20:23.480 --> 20:27.160
- To put it simply, he was scared.
- Of what ?

20:29.720 --> 20:30.880
Please follow me.

20:40.359 --> 20:41.359
Here.

20:44.839 --> 20:46.599
We were planning to flee abroad.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.160
Our son has been attending
a school abroad for a year.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.079
Adrian had it all arranged.

20:55.079 --> 20:58.960
- Interesting.
- We had a casual relatonship.

20:59.799 --> 21:04.440
My husband had a lot of affairs but
definitely no reason to kill himself.

21:05.599 --> 21:06.839
Not now.

21:11.279 --> 21:14.440
- Who's Abraham ?
- Sorry ?

21:16.559 --> 21:18.720
Did your husband
ever mention him ?

21:19.240 --> 21:20.799
No, never.

21:24.359 --> 21:26.559
Thank you. I'll let myself out.

22:01.680 --> 22:04.920
- I can't find any sugar.
- I don't mind it bitter.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.000
I'm sorry.

22:28.960 --> 22:33.640
- What's up at work ?
- Fine. Boring stuff, as usual.

22:36.559 --> 22:39.559
Your substitute annoys
everyone so...

22:43.279 --> 22:47.839
Exactly. It's time you stopped
treating him as my substitute.

22:49.119 --> 22:53.519
But he's terrible.
Don't do this to us.

23:04.359 --> 23:05.559
How are you feeling ?

23:10.839 --> 23:11.960
It depends.

23:18.039 --> 23:22.279
- I apologize.
- No. I should have listened to you.

23:25.839 --> 23:27.759
While I should have been braver.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.759
More determined.

23:41.359 --> 23:42.279
Excuse me.

23:45.079 --> 23:48.480
They won't even let me finish
this awful bitter coffee.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.200
It's going to be fine.

23:57.039 --> 23:59.880
All you need is peace
and normal social life.

24:13.599 --> 24:15.680
Weronika, just promise me
one thing.

24:17.519 --> 24:18.599
Yes ?

24:19.799 --> 24:23.440
Don't get involved in anything.
Not now. Please.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.279
All right.

24:29.680 --> 24:30.599
Bye.

25:07.160 --> 25:09.279
This ruin's being handled at last.

25:10.039 --> 25:13.000
Janusz Derenda.
We all deserve a better view.

25:14.279 --> 25:16.839
So, shall we go to my office ?
Please follow me.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.000
What am I supposed
to do with this ?

25:31.759 --> 25:33.920
The photos were taken
in your hotel.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.759
It's up to you what angle
we'll take when writing the article.

25:46.559 --> 25:48.480
- I think it's her.
- I guess so.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.440
All right, we've got the day
Skalski will show up soon.

25:56.279 --> 25:57.400
Here he comes.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.079
Pause it.

26:14.119 --> 26:16.920
- The maid ?
- I don't think so.

26:22.079 --> 26:23.519
What was that ? Rewind it.

26:28.119 --> 26:29.680
Seven minutes are missing.

26:32.119 --> 26:34.160
Check other cameras on this floor.

26:39.359 --> 26:40.440
Still missing.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.920
- The lift, the lift at 9:16.
- It's there.

27:04.680 --> 27:08.039
What was that ?
A sequel to the tapping scandal ?

27:10.119 --> 27:12.000
- Who told you to do it ?
- Nobody.

27:12.079 --> 27:14.200
- A hobby of yours ?
- Yes, it is.

27:15.119 --> 27:17.759
- Only here ?
- Other places too.

27:18.599 --> 27:22.519
- I like to know things.
- The police like to know you too.

27:22.599 --> 27:25.839
Excuse me, since when have we been
on first name terms ?

27:25.920 --> 27:29.559
Look, let's talk like adults
or I'm calling the police.

27:32.720 --> 27:36.160
Fine.
These photos, it's nothing.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.279
If you want a real scandal,
I'll give you one.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.400
And ?

28:05.799 --> 28:08.759
Something stinks.
I'll have more info tomorrow.

28:08.839 --> 28:12.079
Today we're closing the story.
Is there something wrong ?

28:12.440 --> 28:15.519
I made a promisewe wouldn't
mention the hotel owner.

28:15.599 --> 28:17.319
- He helped me a lot.
- Hold on.

28:17.400 --> 28:20.480
There's a guy
who didn't protect his guests' privacy

28:20.559 --> 28:22.440
and you promised him anonymity ?

28:22.519 --> 28:25.799
- It's not like that.
- Doesn't matter if he knew about it.

28:25.880 --> 28:28.759
The guy's guilty.
Someone watches hotel guests.

28:28.839 --> 28:31.839
And the Minister has links
to the world of business.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.680
This is crucial information.
You know what to do.

29:14.119 --> 29:16.039
Are they from a supermarket too ?

29:16.119 --> 29:18.799
I told you not to do the shopping
in big stores.

29:21.400 --> 29:22.799
Protein hydrolyzate...

29:26.440 --> 29:29.400
- What are you looking for ?
- The story of Abraham.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.519
The Book of Genesis,
chapter 22.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.799
Some time later
God tested Abraham.

29:52.400 --> 29:56.920
He said... "Take your son,
your only son, whom you love - Isaac.

29:59.720 --> 30:03.400
Sacrifice him as a burnt offering
on a mountain I will show you."

30:07.480 --> 30:11.759
Abraham bound his son Isaac
and laid him on the altar.

30:13.680 --> 30:20.599
Then he reached out his hand
and took the knife to slay his son.

30:31.240 --> 30:34.480
- What do you need it for ?
- Work.

30:42.119 --> 30:43.880
Yes. Yes, all right.

30:47.519 --> 30:48.640
Where ?

30:49.599 --> 30:50.960
I'll be there. Thank you.

30:54.279 --> 30:55.240
Have to go.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.160
See you.

32:06.079 --> 32:09.680
- Hello.
- Hello. I'm sorry to bother you.

32:09.759 --> 32:12.799
You were to tell me
something important, I'm all ears.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.079
It's about Weronika.

32:21.920 --> 32:24.640
She's ill.
She needs peace and quiet.

32:26.279 --> 32:27.240
Meaning ?

32:27.880 --> 32:31.279
Meaning her mental state
is rather poor. Didn't you notice ?

32:33.440 --> 32:35.240
Is this why she doesn't go out ?

32:38.599 --> 32:40.680
She needs peace.
Doctor's orders.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.880
And yours, is that right ?
You're keeping her isolated.

32:45.880 --> 32:46.799
No.

32:49.119 --> 32:50.480
Don't drag her into this.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.880
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:56.160 --> 32:59.680
She feels much better now.
I'm asking you for her good.

33:02.480 --> 33:07.559
- We're very close.
- Is that all ?

33:09.960 --> 33:12.160
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

37:17.519 --> 37:20.119
- Get the fuck out of here !
- Kuba, wait !

37:20.199 --> 37:23.239
- Tell him to get the fuck out of here.
- Wait, calm down.

37:28.639 --> 37:31.800
- What the hell is this ?
- We need to talk.

37:35.599 --> 37:37.960
Take only basic necessities.
Hurry up.

37:38.039 --> 37:41.639
- I'm not going anywhere with him.
- Kuba, Piotr is helping us.

37:41.719 --> 37:44.280
- No one asked him to.
- On the contrary.

37:45.039 --> 37:47.280
- Who ?
- Your father.

37:47.639 --> 37:50.280
- On the day he died.
- You're lying.

37:51.679 --> 37:54.360
- I'd like to.
- Come on.

38:35.559 --> 38:38.639
I'm so sorry we've come here
so unexpectedly at night

38:38.719 --> 38:40.559
but it's just worked out this way.

38:41.679 --> 38:43.360
Piotr, what's going on ?

38:43.679 --> 38:47.159
They can't stay at their place
and this is all I can say for now.

38:47.519 --> 38:50.559
- Something's wrong ?
- Nothing's wrong. Don't worry.

38:51.199 --> 38:54.119
You know Ewa
and this is Kuba.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.360
Good evening.

39:02.519 --> 39:04.639
Tadeusz Grodecki,
your grandpa.

39:09.159 --> 39:12.199
- Which room was my father's ?
- There, straight ahead.

39:14.320 --> 39:15.360
Kuba, wait.

39:19.199 --> 39:20.280
I apologise.

41:24.079 --> 41:25.039
Get up.

41:25.760 --> 41:27.559
- What is it ?
- Get dressed.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.079
- What is it ?
- Let's go.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.199
Get dressed and ready.

41:37.719 --> 41:39.719
- What's going on ?
- Let's go.

41:49.599 --> 41:50.639
What's wrong ?

42:10.760 --> 42:11.840
Dad !

42:14.079 --> 42:15.039
Dad !

42:17.320 --> 42:18.280
Dad !

42:32.159 --> 42:33.159
Dad !

43:02.760 --> 43:04.320
Dad !

44:01.599 --> 44:03.960
