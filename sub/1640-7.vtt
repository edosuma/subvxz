00:03.057 --> 00:04.910
All right, sorry about
the close quarters, Coop.

00:04.911 --> 00:06.455
We're gonna be working from
the home office for a while.

00:06.456 --> 00:07.630
Yeah, it sucks.

00:07.631 --> 00:11.038
Panoramic view, fiber-optic
wi-fi, working toilets.

00:11.538 --> 00:12.932
Cheeseburgers on pretzel bread.

00:12.966 --> 00:15.034
That's it, I quit.

00:15.068 --> 00:17.837
Cooper, wait until you
try Gabi's waffle fries.

00:17.871 --> 00:20.706
With my special, secret-recipe ketchup.

00:20.741 --> 00:21.908
Ooh, what's the secret?

00:21.942 --> 00:23.009
(Whispers) Bought it at the store.

00:25.045 --> 00:27.046
Here, why don't you...
why don't you try some?

00:27.080 --> 00:29.081
Oh, no!

00:29.116 --> 00:30.709
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:30.710 --> 00:33.846
Why don't you come to the laundry room
with me and I'll help you get it out.

00:35.823 --> 00:37.790
Gabi, I don't even care about this shirt.

00:37.825 --> 00:38.958
I found it in a dumpster...

00:42.896 --> 00:46.799
(Chuckles) Oh, I see what you're doing.

00:46.834 --> 00:48.868
Quick, spill some on my pants.

00:48.902 --> 00:50.803
Ooh, I see what you're doing.

00:50.838 --> 00:51.804
(Giggles)

00:55.542 --> 00:58.845
You know what, I feel really bad
about sneaking behind Josh's back...

00:58.879 --> 01:01.648
But it's also kind of hot.

01:01.682 --> 01:04.650
It's fascinating that your criminal
tendencies bring on arousal.

01:04.685 --> 01:08.288
Wow, look at you with the sexy talk.

01:08.322 --> 01:10.323
Okay, let's get out of here
before Josh gets suspicious.

01:10.357 --> 01:11.524
Oh, whoa, what about the stain?

01:11.558 --> 01:13.126
Should I take the shirt off?

01:13.160 --> 01:15.061
You do that and we'll
never get out of here.

Uh-oh.

- Hey, Elliot, where you going?
- Talk later!

01:57.871 --> 01:58.871
So I'll see you tonight at my place?

01:58.906 --> 02:00.773
- Yeah.
- Why are you going to Gabi's?

02:00.808 --> 02:02.408
- Ah!
- Josh!

02:02.443 --> 02:04.777
Wait, you two aren't...

02:04.812 --> 02:06.479
Dating? No!

02:06.513 --> 02:07.480
We would never go out behind your back.

02:07.514 --> 02:08.580
That would be deceitful.

02:08.615 --> 02:11.184
I don't even find her attractive anymore.

02:12.486 --> 02:14.253
I mean, you know, no, thanks!

02:14.288 --> 02:15.321
Pass!

02:17.358 --> 02:19.792
We get it.

02:19.827 --> 02:21.194
So why are you going to her place?

02:21.228 --> 02:24.964
(Scoffs) Well, he's coming to see, um...

02:24.998 --> 02:26.733
Sofia.

02:26.767 --> 02:28.501
You're dating Sofia?

02:28.535 --> 02:29.469
Go, Coop!

02:29.503 --> 02:31.504
Yeah! Yeah, who knew.

02:31.538 --> 02:32.872
And you're okay with this, Gabi?

02:32.906 --> 02:34.607
Of course.

02:34.641 --> 02:37.677
Without me, their entire
relationship would not exist.

02:37.711 --> 02:39.612
I mean, I introduced
them a couple of weeks ago

02:39.646 --> 02:41.347
and they just... they
hit it off like crazy.

02:41.382 --> 02:44.350
Yeah, this whole thing is crazy.

02:45.986 --> 02:47.053
Why didn't you guys just tell me?

02:48.055 --> 02:49.255
It was new.

02:49.289 --> 02:52.125
So, so new.

02:52.159 --> 02:55.728
Well, how about tomorrow night Caroline
and I take you and Sofia to dinner?

02:56.764 --> 02:57.730
- Um...
- Um...

02:57.765 --> 03:01.567
Or I could cook for you guys here
so I can keep an eye on things,

03:01.602 --> 03:03.403
like... like the dinner.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.340
Yeah, cool. Just something simple.

03:07.374 --> 03:09.208
Of course, Josh.

03:09.243 --> 03:11.144
Wouldn't want to cook up
anything too complicated.

<i>Radio DJ: And the phone lines are open.</i>

03:19.953 --> 03:22.054
Oh, come on. Mama needs
a new pair of tickets.

03:22.089 --> 03:23.122
Please, please, please.

03:23.157 --> 03:26.826
<i>Radio DJ: Jose from Stockton, you're
our ninth caller! You just won tickets</i>

03:26.860 --> 03:28.795
<i>to the sold-out Lorde concert.</i>

03:28.829 --> 03:30.830
Are you sure Sofia's
going to be okay with this?

03:30.864 --> 03:31.898
Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it.

03:31.932 --> 03:35.601
You suck, Jose from Stockton. I hate you!

03:35.636 --> 03:38.304
Okay, maybe worry a little bit.

03:38.338 --> 03:40.373
I was talking to the radio.

03:40.407 --> 03:43.142
I have been trying to
win Lorde tickets all day.

03:43.177 --> 03:46.179
Oh... well, you know what's
going to make you feel better?

03:47.347 --> 03:50.149
Me making you an amazing
dinner tomorrow night.

03:50.184 --> 03:52.084
What'd you do?

03:52.119 --> 03:54.086
(Sighs) Why is it every time
I try and do something nice

03:54.121 --> 03:55.121
you think it's 'cause I did something bad?

03:55.155 --> 03:56.589
Well, did you?

03:56.623 --> 03:58.591
I did.

03:58.625 --> 04:00.793
Is it gonna ruin my
night, my week or my life?

04:00.828 --> 04:03.529
(Chuckles) You're so funny...

04:03.564 --> 04:05.364
And pretty.

04:05.399 --> 04:07.500
No wonder Cooper wants to take you
on a date with Josh and Caroline.

04:07.534 --> 04:09.235
What?

04:09.269 --> 04:11.204
Look, Josh almost caught
me and Cooper together,

04:11.238 --> 04:13.306
and I covered and I said
he was going out with you.

04:13.340 --> 04:16.041
At first I thought it was a bad idea,

04:16.076 --> 04:19.111
but now that I hear it, it's horrendous.

04:19.146 --> 04:21.880
- It's gonna be fun.
- Hm...

04:21.915 --> 04:23.883
An uncomfortable way.

04:23.951 --> 04:25.985
Well, no, it's not gonna
be uncomfortable at all...

04:26.019 --> 04:27.086
See, I told you she'd be fine with it.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.856
'Cause I'm not going.

04:29.890 --> 04:30.890
No, you have to.

04:30.924 --> 04:32.658
What's the word I'm looking for? No.

04:32.693 --> 04:33.860
<i>But I'm making your
favorite hors d'oeuvres.</i>

04:33.894 --> 04:35.495
- No.
- And I have a plan

04:35.529 --> 04:36.496
that you're gonna break
up with Cooper at dinner.

04:36.530 --> 04:37.663
Oh. No.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.534
Okay, I'm just gonna keep asking
until you say yes, all right?

04:41.568 --> 04:43.603
(Spanish accent) I'm going
to ask in a Spanish accent.

04:43.637 --> 04:46.339
(Baby voice) I'm going
to ask like a little baby.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.074
(Robot voice) I'm going to ask
like a robot.

04:48.108 --> 04:51.344
Okay, okay. I will do it, but
I'm not gonna be happy about it.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.813
Oh, see? Cooper won't either.

04:53.847 --> 04:55.815
You guys have so much in common already.

05:00.053 --> 05:01.854
Oh my damn. (Sniffing)

05:01.889 --> 05:04.857
What the hell is that smell?

05:04.892 --> 05:08.594
Oh, it's stuffed mushrooms with
garlic, eggplant and parmesan.

05:08.629 --> 05:10.396
She was being rhetorical, bitch!

05:11.698 --> 05:14.433
Sorry, day two of our juice cleanse.

05:16.603 --> 05:18.337
I just need one sniff.

05:20.207 --> 05:22.008
Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

05:22.042 --> 05:23.075
Oh, let me get in there.

05:24.344 --> 05:26.245
Oh, that's good stuff.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.947
- Yeah.
- Real good stuff.

05:27.981 --> 05:29.749
Put that down!

05:29.783 --> 05:31.784
Just one more sniff. I
can stop anytime I want.

05:31.818 --> 05:34.654
Oh, no, this is breaking bad.

05:40.727 --> 05:42.828
Oh, Juju, this is so much fun.

05:42.863 --> 05:45.398
How much longer?

05:45.432 --> 05:46.432
They're right there.

05:46.466 --> 05:47.400
I know.

05:47.434 --> 05:48.634
How much longer?

05:50.671 --> 05:52.271
(Gabi chuckles)

05:52.339 --> 05:54.273
Aren't these two so cute together?

05:54.308 --> 05:57.076
The way they keep scooting
towards each other.

05:58.211 --> 05:59.245
(Nervous laugh)

05:59.279 --> 06:02.815
So, did Sofia tell you that
she got promoted at work?

06:02.849 --> 06:04.884
You did? Congratulations...

06:04.918 --> 06:07.853
Again.

06:07.888 --> 06:10.890
I know that she got promoted
because we're dating.

06:12.492 --> 06:14.393
Good for you, Sofia.

06:14.428 --> 06:18.264
Yeah, it only took two years for my
meteoric rise from intern to assistant.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.300
I now work for Garber of
Garber, Stukenbaker, and Rizz.

06:21.335 --> 06:22.335
- Winston Garber?
- Yeah.

06:22.369 --> 06:24.270
- That's my godfather.
- No way!

06:24.304 --> 06:26.238
Though, I call him "Dickie Donut."

06:26.273 --> 06:31.110
You call Mr. Garber, "Dickie Donut"?

06:31.144 --> 06:33.145
Well, the only nickname I
get to call him is "sir."

06:33.180 --> 06:34.847
Why do you call him that?

06:34.881 --> 06:38.684
Well, you know that limerick, "there
once was a man from nantucket"?

06:38.719 --> 06:40.653
That's Dickie. But with a donut.

06:40.687 --> 06:42.488
(Laughing)

06:47.361 --> 06:48.628
(Boisterous laughing)

06:48.662 --> 06:50.563
I just can't get over how
great you two are together.

06:50.597 --> 06:53.366
Well, who wouldn't want to be
with this caramel-coated angel?

06:53.400 --> 06:54.500
(Laughs)

06:54.534 --> 06:59.905
Wow, that was... A little bit racist
but flattering at the same time.

07:01.174 --> 07:02.174
You are amazing.

07:02.209 --> 07:04.076
(Gasps) Thank you for getting me.

07:04.111 --> 07:08.681
So sorry to interrupt, but can I borrow
my caramel-coated friend for a minute?

07:10.817 --> 07:14.620
Can I just say, when I grow
up I want to be Caroline!

07:14.655 --> 07:16.522
Yeah, yeah. She's tall.

07:16.556 --> 07:18.791
Um, listen, I just want to go over
the break-up plan really quick.

07:18.825 --> 07:21.727
Okay, you're gonna text me, I'm gonna
pretend it's from my ex-boyfriend,

07:21.762 --> 07:23.629
Cooper will get mad, we'll fight, break up,

07:23.664 --> 07:25.598
and then hopefully Caroline
and I will stay friends.

07:25.632 --> 07:27.166
Okay.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.136
So Josh and I can't agree on what
singer to hire for the wedding.

07:30.170 --> 07:33.039
He wants Harry Connick
Jr. I want John Legend.

07:33.073 --> 07:35.041
(Laughs) Why don't you just get Lorde?

07:35.075 --> 07:37.877
Well, she's a guest and
I'd hate to ask her to sing.

07:37.911 --> 07:39.779
(Giggling)

07:41.715 --> 07:43.949
You know Lorde?!

07:43.984 --> 07:46.886
Sofia loves Lorde.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.355
I know this 'cause we're dating.

07:51.391 --> 07:54.427
I have been trying to win
Lorde tickets all week.

07:54.461 --> 07:55.461
Really?

07:55.495 --> 07:57.129
Well, I can get us tickets...

07:57.164 --> 07:58.497
And backstage passes.

07:58.532 --> 08:01.067
- We can go together.
- Really?

08:02.302 --> 08:04.336
- (Cell phone chimes)
- Oh.

08:04.371 --> 08:07.973
Uh, is that your ex-boyfriend
texting you again?

08:12.112 --> 08:13.612
Nope.

08:14.981 --> 08:16.615
So tell me about Lorde.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.917
Oh, angry baking I see.

08:30.527 --> 08:31.777
Well, good night.

08:32.655 --> 08:35.623
Oh, so you're gonna be able to sleep
after betraying your best friend?

08:35.658 --> 08:37.592
Okay, someone's a little mad.

08:37.626 --> 08:39.327
You were supposed to break
up with Cooper at dinner,

08:39.361 --> 08:40.361
not make plans for another date.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.596
It's not a date, okay?

08:41.630 --> 08:46.267
We're just driving with another couple
to see a concert and then go to dinner.

08:46.302 --> 08:48.169
Actually, that does sound like a date.

08:48.204 --> 08:50.205
You strayed very far from the plan.

08:50.239 --> 08:53.107
Yeah, a plan that you just
assumed that I would go along with,

08:53.142 --> 08:54.876
like I do all your plans.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.812
You know what? You take me for granted.

08:57.846 --> 08:59.914
(Scoffs) I do not take you for granted.

08:59.949 --> 09:02.817
You agreed to the plan
and then you went rogue.

09:02.851 --> 09:05.587
For Lorde!

09:05.621 --> 09:08.356
Well, you know what?
No, I forbid you to go.

09:08.390 --> 09:09.691
Forbid me?

09:09.725 --> 09:14.295
Well, nobody forbids Sofia Maria
Consuela Rafaella Rodriguez!

09:15.397 --> 09:19.133
Not only am I going to the
concert, I am out of here.

09:20.202 --> 09:22.103
<i>(Door slams)</i>

09:22.137 --> 09:24.105
Fine!

09:24.139 --> 09:26.074
Now it's time for some angry eating.

09:29.845 --> 09:31.012
(Sadly) Oh, that's so good.

09:35.718 --> 09:36.851
Good morning, Gabi.

09:36.885 --> 09:37.852
Oh, hey, Josh.

09:39.555 --> 09:40.521
You okay?

09:40.556 --> 09:41.522
Not really.

09:41.557 --> 09:44.325
Sofia didn't come home last night
and I have no idea where she is.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.727
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

09:47.630 --> 09:50.198
She's, uh, right there.
I'll be in my office.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.567
Sofia?

09:52.601 --> 09:54.068
Oh, hi, Gabi.

09:55.170 --> 09:57.105
You spent the night here?

09:57.139 --> 10:00.008
Sure did. Caroline invited me.

10:00.042 --> 10:02.076
Sofia sit down and have some breakfast.

10:02.111 --> 10:03.978
Um, could we get two coffees?

10:07.016 --> 10:09.784
(Chuckles) Here you go.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.019
(Whispers) What's going on?

10:11.053 --> 10:12.654
Oh, no need to whisper.

10:12.688 --> 10:14.055
Sofia told me everything.

10:14.089 --> 10:15.890
"Everything" everything?

10:15.924 --> 10:20.628
Yes, she called me last night and could
tell that I was upset, so I told her why...

10:20.663 --> 10:21.763
Cooper and I broke up.

10:21.797 --> 10:23.531
(Sighs) Thank God.

10:26.335 --> 10:29.370
I mean, I'm so sorry for you.

10:29.405 --> 10:31.439
It is sad, but I made her feel better.

10:31.473 --> 10:33.207
We're still going to see Lorde.

10:33.242 --> 10:35.376
Oh, Caroline, you're the best.

10:35.411 --> 10:37.145
A good, good friend.

10:37.179 --> 10:40.114
You've been friends for three hours!

10:41.283 --> 10:42.917
Oh my God.

10:42.951 --> 10:44.686
That's the longest
friendship I've ever had.

10:48.757 --> 10:51.726
Whoo, this cleanse is cleansing
me out of my will to live.

10:51.760 --> 10:55.396
I'm so hungry, I'd slap your
mamma for some caramel corn.

10:56.765 --> 11:00.501
Well, why don't you complain
about it some more, you whiny hag!

11:00.536 --> 11:01.636
I'm sorry.

11:01.670 --> 11:04.372
I feel like in the final
round of the Hunger Games.

11:06.175 --> 11:07.542
Why'd we go on this damn thing anyway?

11:09.545 --> 11:12.413
My ex-husband just got engaged...

11:12.448 --> 11:14.248
To a 28-year-old...

11:14.283 --> 11:17.085
Who's, you know, 28 years old.

11:17.119 --> 11:20.021
Which means I've got to get
back into my fighting weight...

11:20.055 --> 11:22.857
In case I got to fight her.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.159
So... so why did you go on this diet?

11:25.194 --> 11:26.961
If I tell you, you'll laugh.

11:26.995 --> 11:28.096
Just cough it up!

11:29.898 --> 11:31.766
Sorry, low blood sugar.

11:34.570 --> 11:36.637
Some guys I used to work
with back in the '80s

11:36.672 --> 11:38.506
are visiting and I just
want to look my best.

11:38.540 --> 11:40.375
Oh, why would I laugh at that?

11:40.409 --> 11:45.446
Because we were exotic dancers
called "The Boy Toys of Illinois."

11:49.118 --> 11:50.318
Oh, I gotta see this.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.021
- (Pop music playing)
- (Women cheering)

11:55.257 --> 11:56.891
(Whip cracks)

12:08.904 --> 12:10.838
(Laughing)

12:13.442 --> 12:14.575
I got... I got...

12:15.811 --> 12:18.646
I'm laughing so hard, I'm
burning all kinds of calories.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.618
Gabi, I'm not really
in the mood to make out.

12:23.652 --> 12:25.119
No, me either.

12:25.154 --> 12:26.354
<i>Sofia and I got into the biggest fight.</i>

12:26.388 --> 12:27.388
<i>Everything is so messed up.</i>

12:27.423 --> 12:29.157
Don't worry, I have a plan.

12:29.191 --> 12:32.260
Okay, I'm really good
at pattern recognition,

12:32.294 --> 12:36.964
and every time you say you have
a plan, something bad happens.

12:37.399 --> 12:39.567
No no, it'll fix this
whole mess Sofia made.

12:39.601 --> 12:42.203
Gabi, this isn't Sofia's fault.

12:42.237 --> 12:44.939
If you hadn't told her
to lie in the first place,

12:44.973 --> 12:46.040
none of this would have ever happened.

12:46.074 --> 12:48.809
Well, excuse me for
really, really liking you

12:48.844 --> 12:50.177
and doing everything I can
so that we can be together.

12:50.212 --> 12:54.615
All of this lying and deception is
really making my shingles flare up.

12:55.617 --> 12:57.585
And they've been dormant a very long time.

12:59.521 --> 13:03.157
Well, how else are we supposed to see
each other without losing our jobs?

13:03.191 --> 13:08.162
Gabi, you're adorable and
so much fun to be around,

13:08.196 --> 13:11.098
but I just don't know if I'm
up for the non-stop adventure

13:11.133 --> 13:13.934
that comes with being your boyfriend.

13:13.969 --> 13:16.170
I hope we can be friends.

13:16.204 --> 13:18.005
Yeah, me too...

13:18.040 --> 13:19.874
Or that you die in a
fire... I mean, me too.

13:29.563 --> 13:31.664
For lunch today, I made
a Chinese chicken salad

13:31.699 --> 13:34.467
with radicchio, fresh orange
slices, and crispy wontons.

13:34.501 --> 13:36.436
Enjoy. (Whimpering)

13:36.470 --> 13:38.471
Well, just leave one. Cooper left early.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.806
He's really bummed out
about the breakup with Sofia.

13:40.841 --> 13:42.741
(Crying)

13:42.776 --> 13:43.809
Whoa.

13:43.844 --> 13:45.578
You're taking this pretty hard.

13:45.612 --> 13:48.514
Uh, yeah, they were just
a really great couple.

13:48.548 --> 13:49.548
I was really rooting for them.

13:49.583 --> 13:50.516
Oh, me too.

13:50.550 --> 13:53.519
And they weren't really dating, I
was the one who was dating Cooper.

13:53.553 --> 13:56.088
Wait. What?

13:56.123 --> 13:57.256
What are you talking about?

13:57.290 --> 13:58.424
What about dinner with Sofia?

13:58.458 --> 14:01.160
It was fake. I made her go.

14:01.194 --> 14:03.195
In my defense, I had a whole plan.

14:03.230 --> 14:05.131
So I wouldn't find out.

14:05.165 --> 14:06.899
Look, this only happened
because of your stupid rule

14:06.933 --> 14:08.167
about not dating anybody
that you work with.

14:08.201 --> 14:09.735
I had no choice.

14:09.769 --> 14:11.937
You could have... Not dated him.

14:14.574 --> 14:17.676
You know, Gabi, I gotta be honest, I'm
less than thrilled with you right now.

14:17.711 --> 14:20.579
Listen, I know I probably deserve
to be yelled at, but can you just...

14:20.614 --> 14:23.349
can you just not be my boss
right now and just be my friend?

14:23.383 --> 14:25.351
'Cause I really need one.

14:25.385 --> 14:27.386
Of course.

14:27.420 --> 14:29.355
(Sighs) I'm just really upset.

14:29.389 --> 14:31.557
I feel like I lost the best
relationship I ever had.

14:31.591 --> 14:33.292
Come on, has it even been a week?

14:33.326 --> 14:35.461
No, I'm not talking about Cooper.

14:35.495 --> 14:37.930
I'm talking about Sofia.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.199
Oh.

14:40.233 --> 14:42.701
She's been my best friend
since seventh grade,

14:42.736 --> 14:44.937
and now I feel like Caroline's
gonna take her away from me.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.705
I wouldn't worry about Caroline.

14:46.740 --> 14:47.840
She tires of her friends pretty quickly.

14:47.874 --> 14:49.742
I don't even learn their names anymore.

14:49.776 --> 14:52.578
Well, she won't ditch Sofia.

14:52.612 --> 14:53.846
She's a keeper.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.549
And so are you.

14:56.583 --> 14:59.285
Look, we're all going to Lorde tonight,
so why don't you grab Cooper's extra ticket

14:59.319 --> 15:01.453
and you and Sofia can
maybe work things out.

15:01.488 --> 15:04.456
This is a really special night for her, and
if I go, it'll just ruin the whole thing.

15:04.491 --> 15:06.258
Do you want me to say something?

15:06.293 --> 15:08.127
No, please don't say anything.

15:08.161 --> 15:09.995
Promise me you won't say anything.

15:10.030 --> 15:11.163
Okay.

15:12.299 --> 15:13.365
And one last thing...

15:13.400 --> 15:18.037
- Are Cooper and I fired?
- No.

15:18.071 --> 15:19.872
Then can I go home early?
I've had a really hard day.

15:21.775 --> 15:22.741
Go.

15:22.776 --> 15:24.677
And can I take this extra salad?

15:24.711 --> 15:25.644
'Cause I already tossed
it with the dressing and...

15:25.679 --> 15:26.745
Go!

15:30.884 --> 15:32.718
Wow. (Chuckles)

15:32.752 --> 15:35.321
Last time I was in a limo was for my prom.

15:35.355 --> 15:38.524
F.Y.I., if somebody pukes in
here... security deposit? Gone.

15:38.558 --> 15:40.326
To new best friends.

15:40.360 --> 15:41.360
Oh.

15:41.394 --> 15:42.428
And old ones.

15:42.462 --> 15:46.065
But more new. (Laughs)

15:46.099 --> 15:48.133
You're being kind of quiet.

15:48.168 --> 15:49.868
(Tersely) Get in the party mood.

15:51.171 --> 15:52.805
Sofia, can you take a photo of us?

15:52.839 --> 15:54.073
Sure.

15:55.875 --> 15:56.842
Okay.

15:56.876 --> 15:58.744
- (Sighs) Um...
- (Phone chimes)

15:58.778 --> 16:01.547
Oh, Josh, you just got a text from Gabi.

16:01.581 --> 16:04.750
"Remember, don't tell Sofia
that Cooper broke up with me.

16:04.784 --> 16:06.518
Hope she's having fun."

16:07.687 --> 16:09.221
Cooper broke up with her?

16:09.256 --> 16:12.324
You didn't hear it from me, but... yes.

16:12.359 --> 16:14.526
Oh my God.

16:14.561 --> 16:17.062
- Okay, stop the limo.
- Wait, what's going on?

16:17.097 --> 16:18.197
Okay, uh...

16:18.231 --> 16:19.365
I wasn't really dating Cooper.

16:19.399 --> 16:22.067
I was only pretending to
for Gabi so that Cooper

16:22.102 --> 16:23.869
and Gabi wouldn't get in trouble with Josh.

16:23.903 --> 16:25.137
(Gasps)

16:25.171 --> 16:27.139
So you lied to me?

16:27.173 --> 16:32.978
This whole thing was just a sick
charade so... so you could see Lorde.

16:33.013 --> 16:37.483
(Chuckles) I had no idea
you could be so devious.

16:37.517 --> 16:38.851
I didn't think I could love you more!

16:38.885 --> 16:40.686
- Oh!
- (Laughing)

16:40.720 --> 16:42.421
Okay, I love you, too.

16:42.455 --> 16:43.689
I gotta go.

16:46.393 --> 16:49.128
(Exhales)

16:49.162 --> 16:51.096
Limo sex?

16:51.131 --> 16:53.098
- Is there any other kind?
- Get over here.

16:53.133 --> 16:54.133
(Giggling)

16:57.137 --> 17:00.139
Okay, I peed three times.

17:00.173 --> 17:01.874
I'm ready for the moment of truth.

17:02.909 --> 17:04.042
But first my watch.

17:10.750 --> 17:11.750
(Sharp inhale)

17:11.785 --> 17:13.685
Yes, I lost 30 pounds.

17:13.720 --> 17:14.853
What?!

17:14.887 --> 17:16.755
30 pounds?! Let me on there.

17:17.757 --> 17:20.726
(Shrieks) I lost 35.

17:22.862 --> 17:24.396
Wait.

17:24.431 --> 17:28.334
In three days, is that even possible?

17:28.367 --> 17:32.137
Okay, I have a confession.

17:32.172 --> 17:35.541
I wanted you to feel good about yourself
in front of your exotic dancer friends.

17:35.575 --> 17:38.377
So I cheated the scale back 15 pounds.

17:38.411 --> 17:41.347
But that still means that
you lost 15 and I lost 20.

17:41.381 --> 17:47.953
Uh, not really, because I also wanted
you to feel good about yourself,

17:47.987 --> 17:50.089
so I cheated it back 15 pounds.

17:50.123 --> 17:52.858
So I only lost 5 pounds?

17:52.892 --> 17:55.828
Better than me, I didn't lose anything...

17:57.697 --> 17:59.798
Except my self-confidence.

17:59.833 --> 18:00.766
<i>(Doorbell rings)</i>

18:00.800 --> 18:02.968
Oh, no. It's "The Boy Toys."

18:05.505 --> 18:07.506
I'm gonna tell them that Elliot died

18:07.540 --> 18:09.708
in a pole dancing accident
and that I'm Dwayne,

18:09.743 --> 18:11.610
his chubby twin brother.

18:11.644 --> 18:14.913
No no no, you have
nothing to be ashamed of.

18:14.948 --> 18:18.784
Now you open that door and you
be proud of the body God gave you.

18:28.695 --> 18:30.729
Elliot?

18:30.764 --> 18:32.564
Wow, you look great.

18:33.867 --> 18:35.734
Thank you!

18:35.769 --> 18:37.436
So do you.

18:38.805 --> 18:42.541
Not as good as me.

18:42.575 --> 18:44.877
And please tell me that fine
lady standing next to you

18:44.911 --> 18:46.612
is joining us for drinks tonight.

18:46.646 --> 18:50.616
Well, as long as it comes
with a side of buffalo wings

18:50.650 --> 18:51.817
and a pizza...

18:54.554 --> 18:55.654
I'm in.

18:55.688 --> 18:56.789
Hey-yy!

19:04.964 --> 19:07.499
Gabi?

19:07.534 --> 19:08.567
Sofia, what are you doing here?

19:08.601 --> 19:11.637
Well, I couldn't go to the concert
after I heard about you and Cooper.

19:11.671 --> 19:12.638
Are you okay?

19:12.672 --> 19:14.640
You gave up seeing Lorde?

19:14.674 --> 19:15.774
That doesn't matter, what matters is...

19:15.809 --> 19:19.545
No no no, what matters is you, and
that I hate my life without you.

19:19.579 --> 19:22.548
I am so sorry I took you for
granted, and it'll never happen again.

19:23.983 --> 19:26.552
"I will never take you for grant."

19:28.521 --> 19:29.621
Yeah, I ran out of frosting.

19:29.656 --> 19:31.890
Listen, I love you and I'm really sorry.

19:31.925 --> 19:35.828
Oh, no, I'm sorry. I got so excited about
the concert I didn't stick to the plan.

19:35.862 --> 19:39.731
And I got so excited about my
plan, I didn't stick to my girl.

19:39.766 --> 19:44.570
(Spanish accent) So I'm going to
apologize in a Spanish accent, okay?

19:44.604 --> 19:46.939
(Baby voice) And I'm gonna
apologize like a little baby.

19:46.973 --> 19:48.907
(Robot voice) And I'm going
to apologize like a robot.

19:48.942 --> 19:50.843
Okay, okay, I forgive you.

19:50.877 --> 19:52.544
So, uh...

19:52.579 --> 19:56.682
Why don't you grab the cake, I got
the wine, we turn on "The Notebook",

19:56.716 --> 19:58.650
and let's get you over Cooper.

19:58.685 --> 20:01.520
Eh, who needs Cooper when
I have the best friend ever?

20:01.554 --> 20:02.688
Here you go.

20:04.591 --> 20:06.592
- (Sighs)
- (Muffled) Oh my God.

20:06.626 --> 20:07.726
(Muffled) Oh, I'm so good at my job.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.112
I can't believe you
invited Caroline over here.

20:15.113 --> 20:16.932
I can't believe she said, "yes."

20:18.192 --> 20:21.327
She probably just wants the blood of young
girls for her face cream or something.

20:21.361 --> 20:24.330
Will you relax? We're just having lunch.

20:24.364 --> 20:26.165
Hmm, that's what Hannibal Lecter said.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.533
<i>(Knocking)</i>

20:27.568 --> 20:30.036
She's here! Ah!

20:32.039 --> 20:33.272
- Hi!
- Hi!

20:38.045 --> 20:39.212
No.

20:39.246 --> 20:41.247
No no no no no.

20:41.281 --> 20:42.248
(Scoffs) Oh no.

20:48.128 --> 20:50.081
I thought she’d never leave.
