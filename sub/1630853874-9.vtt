WEBVTT

00:11.678 --> 00:13.722
<i>Well, the jig was up.</i>

00:13.805 --> 00:16.391
<i>Devi and Des had been caught</i>
<i>rounding second…</i>

00:17.308 --> 00:19.728
Des, honey,
do you know where my credit card--

00:20.937 --> 00:24.482
<i>…and were now in the dugout</i>
<i>waiting to be ejected from the stadium.</i>

00:24.983 --> 00:27.652
<i>See? I know more sports than just tennis.</i>

00:27.736 --> 00:28.945
Okay, guys, listen.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.449
I know you're both attractive,
vivacious young people

00:32.532 --> 00:36.953
with growing bodies and needs,
but I'm afraid this is a no-go.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.080
Why? I've had girlfriends before.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.708
I get that, honey,
but Nalini doesn't allow Devi to date<i>,</i>

00:41.791 --> 00:43.293
and we have to respect her boundaries.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.628
<i>Oh God, look at her face.</i>

00:45.712 --> 00:47.839
<i>This punishment was gonna be stiff.</i>

00:47.922 --> 00:49.549
<i>Maybe military school?</i>

00:49.632 --> 00:51.051
<i>A year in solitary?</i>

00:51.134 --> 00:52.635
<i>A job in the mines?</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:55.263
You know what? I'm going to allow it.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.265
-Huh?
<i>Huh?</i>

00:57.348 --> 00:58.975
I'd obviously rather you not date

00:59.059 --> 01:01.311
until you have received
an advanced degree of some sort,

01:01.394 --> 01:03.521
but since you insist
on disobeying me constantly,

01:03.605 --> 01:05.523
I'm just going to take a win
where I can get one.

01:06.608 --> 01:07.901
Nalini, what are you saying?

01:07.984 --> 01:10.945
Des is far better than the riffraff
I've caught my daughter with.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.615
He's a polite Indian boy
with a bright future,

01:13.698 --> 01:16.034
and aside from this nonsense,

01:16.117 --> 01:18.036
he's actually been
a good influence on her.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.037
Well--

01:20.497 --> 01:24.000
Are you sure? I mean, I wouldn't want you
to feel pressured into anything.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.293
Let's give it a try.

01:25.376 --> 01:29.172
And as long as you act like respectable
young people from good families,

01:29.672 --> 01:30.507
I approve.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.966
<i> Hold the damn phone!</i>

01:32.050 --> 01:35.386
<i>Is Devi really allowed to have a boyfriend</i>
<i>for the first time ever?</i>

01:35.470 --> 01:36.805
Holy shit. This kicks ass!

01:46.272 --> 01:49.526
So she just said,
"Cool, sure, kiss Des all you want"?

01:49.609 --> 01:51.611
Has she had any surgeries recently?

01:51.694 --> 01:54.155
My aunt's personality changed
after she got her knee replaced.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.532
Turns out she was hooked on oxy.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.158
No, she's totes sober.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.285
Can you believe it? Des and I are free.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.330
So what are you gonna do
now that you're out in the open?

02:02.413 --> 02:03.998
I have a whole itinerary.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.709
On Friday, he's coming
to my orchestra concert with our moms.

02:06.793 --> 02:10.255
On Saturday, we're bowling, and Sunday,
we're gonna PDA up by the Hollywood sign.

02:10.338 --> 02:13.675
Hey, if all goes well, maybe your mom
will become as loosey-goosey as Eric's.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.593
I heard she lets Rosalia stay the night.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.886
Huh.

02:19.514 --> 02:23.476
Man! Can't believe Eric lost his virginity
before all three of us!

02:25.687 --> 02:28.481
Yeah, um, but why have you not?

02:28.565 --> 02:31.568
We've been kinda wondering. I mean,
you've been dating Trent for over a year.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.611
Did all those dick taps
lead to penis probs?

02:33.695 --> 02:36.447
No, I'm actually the holdup.

02:36.531 --> 02:41.286
You? But you say words like "sensuelle"
and sleep on satin sheets.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.246
You're like the horniest person I know.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.541
Thank you, but I'm also a <i>romantique.</i>

02:46.624 --> 02:49.586
I don't want my first time
to be on Trent's trundle bed

02:49.669 --> 02:51.421
atop bong water stains.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.882
Okay, then what do you want
for your first time?

02:53.965 --> 02:57.135
Nothing crazy, just to be standing
on a windswept moor,

02:57.218 --> 03:00.096
wearing a bodice,
when suddenly a caped nobleman appears,

03:00.180 --> 03:02.932
and we make love against
the bricks of an old abbey.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.895
Mm-kay. Yeah, very specific.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.063
Maybe you should tell Trent
about this fantasy

03:09.147 --> 03:11.399
so he could, like,
buy you guys tickets to Scotland.

03:11.482 --> 03:15.945
No way. If I have to spell it out for him,
it ruins the romance.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.947
Then you may never have sex.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.283
Well, that's a price I'm willing to pay.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.167
Uh, David, love a little help
with our experiment here

03:29.250 --> 03:32.003
if you aren't too busy
making demented faces into your phone.

03:33.254 --> 03:36.466
Sorry, my mom just gave me and Des
the okay to officially date.

03:36.549 --> 03:37.675
So now my sexy selfies

03:37.759 --> 03:39.928
don't have to include
homework questions in them anymore.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.971
Wait. She's letting you date
blazer dork? Why?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.348
Because according to her,

03:43.431 --> 03:47.393
he was preferable to the other lowlives
she's caught me with. No offense.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.562
Hey, I thought your mom and I
had a good rapport.

03:49.646 --> 03:50.855
Clearly not good enough.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.065
You know what this means, right?

03:53.024 --> 03:53.900
Des is a weenie.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.235
Uh-- No, he's not.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.528
If your mom's not worried at all
about you being with him,

03:57.612 --> 04:00.573
then he's gotta be a real dickless beta.
Like a full Ken doll.

04:00.657 --> 04:04.244
Okay, you know what? You're just jealous
that I'm in a mature relationship,

04:04.327 --> 04:07.872
and that you are one TV dinner away
from being like my Uncle Aravind.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.457
He's obsessed with the metaverse.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.792
Whatever. He sounds cool.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.380
Are you still gonna work the door
at my concert for volunteer hours?

04:15.463 --> 04:18.508
Yeah, but they stuck me in coat check
even though it's springtime in Los Angeles

04:18.591 --> 04:20.301
-and no one wears coats.
-Excellent.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.970
Then you'll see us as a couple,

04:22.053 --> 04:24.013
and see that Des isn't dickless at all.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.182
Ew! Why would I see that?

04:26.266 --> 04:28.977
-Okay, you know what I mean.
-Oh.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.563
All right, my phone's recording.
Let's see if baby boy got into college.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.565
Shit, it's not loading. Come on.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.234
It's okay. Just breathe.

04:36.776 --> 04:37.610
Here it comes.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.654
-I'm in!

04:39.737 --> 04:41.864
Yes! I got into college!

04:41.948 --> 04:44.325
-Yes!
-Yeah!

04:44.409 --> 04:46.411
Cal State Long Beach! Oh my God!

04:46.494 --> 04:50.540
Congratulations! You get to go to school
near one of America's busiest ports!

04:50.623 --> 04:51.499
Yeah!

04:51.582 --> 04:54.377
And I'm not even worried
about the hour-long drive.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.212
Finally ready to give podcasts a try.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.380
Thanks, bro.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.758
All right, I guess now
we just have to see what ASU said.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.804
AS what? What even are those letters?

05:04.887 --> 05:06.639
Arizona State University.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.767
Arizona, as in the state, Arizona?

05:10.393 --> 05:13.896
Okay, I just have to click this and…

05:15.315 --> 05:17.692
-Oh shit! I got in!

05:17.775 --> 05:19.902
-Oh my God!

05:19.986 --> 05:23.698
-I… I didn't think I could get in there.
-I didn't think you'd apply there.

05:24.198 --> 05:29.370
So quick question. If you were to attend
Arizona State University in Arizona,

05:29.954 --> 05:31.789
would you commute or…

05:32.832 --> 05:36.169
Uh, to Arizona? No, I'd… I'd have to move.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.254
Well, it's a good thing
that's your second choice.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.049
-Congrats, buddy.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.176
Wow!

05:43.968 --> 05:47.305
<i> Here it was,</i>
<i>Devi's grand debut as a girlf.</i>

05:48.056 --> 05:51.017
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>Devi could experience teen romance</i>

05:51.100 --> 05:54.479
<i>without the fear</i>
<i>of bringing shame upon her family.</i>

05:54.562 --> 05:58.107
Okay, Devi.
Have a wonderful time, okay?

05:58.191 --> 06:00.443
Should we find some seats
before the good ones are taken?

06:00.526 --> 06:02.612
Yes, let's do that.
You knock 'em dead, kiddo.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.947
-I'll be right there.
-Mmm.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.620
Hey. This is going kinda well. Did you see
your mom give me a hug in the parking lot?

06:10.703 --> 06:12.246
I did. She likes you.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.041
Yeah, and that is such a relief because,

06:15.833 --> 06:16.667
you know,

06:17.293 --> 06:18.753
I really like you.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.798
Des, are you being, like,
hella cute right now?

06:21.881 --> 06:25.510
I like to think of it as "cute sexy,"
but call it what you will.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.185
-Kill it up there. See you after?
-Mm-hmm.

06:37.188 --> 06:40.441
Okay, actors,
that rehearsal was mediocre at best,

06:40.525 --> 06:41.734
disgusting at worst.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.654
Please be better prepared
for our dress rehearsal in two weeks.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.989
Make an appointment
with Jonah for your costume fitting.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.076
And once I have your measurements,
no one's allowed to gain or lose an ounce.

06:50.159 --> 06:53.496
That is very dicey legal territory, Jonah.
Please do not.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.671
Hey, Eleanor, you got a minute?

07:01.754 --> 07:05.425
Sure, but you should know that
I'm still 35% in character from rehearsal.

07:05.508 --> 07:06.509
That's fine.

07:06.592 --> 07:09.345
So listen, I've been thinking,
and I really want to go to ASU

07:09.429 --> 07:11.222
and not just because everyone there's hot.

07:11.305 --> 07:12.890
That's only half the reason.

07:12.974 --> 07:16.018
I also think it would just be good for me
to go somewhere new, you know,

07:16.102 --> 07:17.228
but I need you…

07:17.311 --> 07:19.480
To help you tell Trent
because he's gonna freak?

07:20.064 --> 07:21.941
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I can do that.

07:22.024 --> 07:25.194
-When do you want to talk to him?
-Uh… Now?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.112
What?

07:27.071 --> 07:28.698
Trent, come in.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.953
Where is everyone? I thought you said
I won Student of the Month.

07:34.036 --> 07:35.163
I lied, Trent.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.956
There is no Student of the Month here,

07:37.039 --> 07:39.417
and honestly,
if there were, you would not get it.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.835
You're very bad at school.

07:41.586 --> 07:42.462
Fair enough.

07:42.962 --> 07:43.963
So what is this?

07:50.595 --> 07:54.891
I wanted to tell you
that I accepted a spot at ASU.

07:54.974 --> 07:58.561
So I am moving to Arizona next year.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.063
Ah…

08:08.529 --> 08:12.492
You guys can't smooth this betrayal over
with tasty little squirmies!

08:12.575 --> 08:13.409
I'm pissed!

08:13.493 --> 08:14.577
It's not a betrayal.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.828
Yes, it is!

08:16.454 --> 08:18.289
What about the band
that we were gonna start,

08:18.372 --> 08:19.707
or the men's flip-flop line,

08:19.790 --> 08:21.375
or the cool taco truck idea

08:21.459 --> 08:23.628
where the meat's on the outside
of the tortillas?

08:23.711 --> 08:26.047
I never agreed to any of those, man.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.508
Yeah, well, I never agreed
to have a suck-ass friend.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.092
See you never.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.094
Dude…

08:39.352 --> 08:40.353
What's that?

08:40.853 --> 08:44.023
A protein bar. Sorry, I didn't get
a chance to eat before I got here.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.692
Okay, that's no reason to ingest poison.

08:46.776 --> 08:50.780
I mean, it is a little processed,
but it's not poison.

08:50.863 --> 08:54.575
Processed and poison are synonyms.
You know that. We've talked about this.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.995
Hold on. I think I might have something
you can nosh on. Oh, here we go.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.791
Some organic seed mix. Mmm?

09:02.833 --> 09:04.585
-Good evening.

09:04.669 --> 09:08.464
Welcome to the Sherman Oaks
High School Spring Orchestra concert.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.759
It's actually been two years
since our last spring concert,

09:12.260 --> 09:13.928
because as you may remember,

09:14.011 --> 09:17.223
I was a contestant
on <i>Survivor</i> last spring.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.726
If I had a chance to do it again,
I would make less enemies.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.898
<i>In all the excitement</i>
<i>about Devi's new boyfriend,</i>

09:26.399 --> 09:29.402
<i>she'd forgotten that this</i>
<i>was her first orchestra concert</i>

09:29.485 --> 09:31.279
<i>since the orchestra concert.</i>

09:33.823 --> 09:35.074
Mohan?

09:35.157 --> 09:36.784
<i> Is he okay? Is he okay?</i>

09:37.285 --> 09:41.247
Okay. Now, before I bring out
the entire Cricket orchestra,

09:41.330 --> 09:45.251
please welcome
our fabulous Senior String Quartet.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.296
-I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.928
Oh my God, Devi! Are you okay?

09:57.013 --> 09:59.348
I… I saw my dad in the audience.

10:01.684 --> 10:02.518
What?

10:03.311 --> 10:06.063
I… I saw my dad in the audience.

10:06.647 --> 10:10.192
Okay. Okay. Let's just take
some deep breaths, okay?

10:11.485 --> 10:13.362
-Inhale.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.322
Hold it.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.866
-Exhale.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.659
Good. Let's do another one.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.411
-Inhale.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.497
-Exhale.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.043
Better?

10:27.126 --> 10:28.461
Mm-hmm.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.630
Okay. Good.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.924
I'm so sorry. I feel embarrassed.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.843
No, no, no. Don't be.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.762
I am here for you, okay, honey?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.806
Now just tell me what happened.

10:41.390 --> 10:44.477
I don't know.
I've been doing really well recently.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.313
And then I just saw him.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.651
Oh, honey, you had a real scare tonight.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.321
Grief is strange. It comes in waves,

10:55.404 --> 10:58.574
and all you can do is feel your feelings
and just move through it.

10:59.492 --> 11:04.163
But also remember,
grief is an expression of love.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.125
This happened because
of how much you love your dad,

11:08.626 --> 11:10.461
and he loved you so much too.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.466
Now if you don't want to play,
you don't have to.

11:15.549 --> 11:16.967
I am happy to take you home--

11:17.051 --> 11:18.469
No, I'm okay.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.179
I want to.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.641
Thank you so much, Rhyah.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.101
Bring it in.

11:41.826 --> 11:45.162
<i>Devi overcame</i>
<i>her orchestra-centric PTSD</i>

11:45.246 --> 11:48.833
<i>with the help of, let's be honest,</i>
<i>basically her mother-in-law.</i>

11:49.417 --> 11:51.335
<i>As she played the shit out of Liszt,</i>

11:51.419 --> 11:53.921
<i>she felt like nothing</i>
<i>could bring her down.</i>

12:06.350 --> 12:08.894
Okay, before Nalini comes out with Devi,
we need to talk.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.772
-I'm not sure about you two dating.
-What? Why?

12:11.856 --> 12:14.442
Because, honey,
I don't think Devi is right for you.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.987
Don't get me wrong,
she's a wonderful girl, but…

12:18.070 --> 12:21.323
…earlier tonight, I found her
on the bathroom floor hysterical.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.493
She said she saw
her dead father in the audience.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.995
Oh my God. Is she okay?

12:26.078 --> 12:30.249
She's fine. But, honey,
that girl has a lot of problems.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.001
Excuse me.

12:33.127 --> 12:33.961
Sorry, ma'am.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.838
You're overreacting. It's fine.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.716
It's not fine. You are too young
to have to deal with all of that.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.178
I want you to end things,
and I'm not gonna change my mind.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.435
Hi.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.520
You were absolutely amazing.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.149
Thank you, Rhyah.
And thanks for earlier too.

12:56.317 --> 12:59.653
So should we go somewhere for dessert?
Harpist's treat.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.906
Or actually, harpist's mom's treat.

13:01.989 --> 13:05.409
Yes, fine.
It would be my pleasure.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.788
Oh, I wish,
but we should really head home.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.873
Thank you, though,
for such a wonderful night.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.958
-Meet you in the car, <i>kanna.</i>
-Yeah.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.629
-So, see you tomorrow for bowling?

13:17.213 --> 13:20.841
Actually, I just remembered
I have a huge paper due on Monday.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.426
So I… I need the weekend.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.887
That's cool. How's next week?

13:26.263 --> 13:27.556
-Sure.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.851
-You really were great.
-Mmm.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.029
<i>The concert</i>
<i>had been a wild success.</i>

13:42.112 --> 13:45.491
<i>Devi faced her trauma,</i>
<i>her mom was happily Team Des,</i>

13:45.574 --> 13:47.618
<i>and she spanked her harp solo.</i>

13:47.701 --> 13:51.664
<i>So it must be in her head that Des</i>
<i>had felt a little distant all week.</i>

13:51.747 --> 13:54.917
<i>Hey, it's been a minute.</i>
<i>Wanna hang this weekend?</i>

13:56.168 --> 13:57.419
<i>You know what?</i>

13:57.503 --> 14:00.464
<i>I forgot to tell you I'm going to Stanford</i>
<i>this weekend to scope out housing.</i>

14:00.548 --> 14:01.799
<i>Text you when I get back.</i>

14:03.133 --> 14:04.760
Hey, David, do you have a minute?

14:05.344 --> 14:07.137
I only need 30 seconds.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.557
Sweatshirt's crazy,
pants too small, babyGap shoes.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.016
Great, sick burns.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.602
Listen, I actually need to talk to you
about something serious.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.735
At the concert, I overheard Des's mom
tell him that he has to break up with you.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.655
What? That's impossible. Rhyah loves me.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.950
She said you have a lot of problems
and that he needed to end it.

14:28.450 --> 14:29.368
I'm really sorry.

14:32.037 --> 14:35.875
Well, then I guess you misunderstood
because Des didn't break up with me.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.419
So, he's been totally normal since then?

14:38.502 --> 14:41.922
Well, actually, I haven't seen him,
but that's only because he's busy.

14:42.006 --> 14:45.050
-Right. He's pulling a slow fade.
-It's not a slow fade.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.469
Right. Right, right.
He's just fading away very slowly.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.762
You know what, Ben?

14:48.846 --> 14:51.140
You've been throwing digs
at Des since you met him.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.392
You're just jealous
because you're lonely, and miserable,

14:53.475 --> 14:55.561
and you want everyone else
to be as unhappy as you are.

14:55.644 --> 14:58.439
So, guess what?
Here's a quick fade. Buh-bye!

15:05.404 --> 15:08.449
Hey there, buddy.
Haven't heard from you all week.

15:08.532 --> 15:09.366
How you doin'?

15:12.161 --> 15:14.496
I know it's a shock about Paxton.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.916
I can tell you're upset
by your stress carving.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.459
I'm not upset.

15:18.542 --> 15:21.253
I always carve a tombstone
with Traxton written on it.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.089
Trent, I'm your girlfriend.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.049
Talk to me.

15:25.716 --> 15:28.636
I just don't understand
why everyone always has to leave.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.262
First, my dad goes to Napa,

15:30.346 --> 15:33.641
and then my pet rat goes to the rat trap
that my mom set, and now Paxton?

15:33.724 --> 15:36.518
But you and Paxton will always be friends.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.479
You have to let him go.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.648
Good friends don't hold each other back.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.399
Oh, so you're on his side.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.568
Great. Why don't you go to Arizona too?

15:44.652 --> 15:46.820
Enjoy not having daylight savings time.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.907
You know what, Trent? Grow up!

15:49.990 --> 15:52.242
Something great happened
to your best friend,

15:52.326 --> 15:53.827
and you're being selfish.

15:53.911 --> 15:59.333
And frankly, this energy is very unsexy
to me, and I'm walking away now.

16:02.544 --> 16:06.090
<i>The next day, Ben's voice</i>
<i>was still buzzing in Devi's ear.</i>

16:06.173 --> 16:08.717
Ben's full of shit.
Right?Des is just busy.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.470
He's literally up in Stanford right now
making sure he doesn't end up

16:11.553 --> 16:12.846
in the dry dorm with the Mormons.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.599
Yeah. Forget Ben. You and Des are perfect.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.559
He's probably up in Palo Alto

16:17.643 --> 16:20.646
bragging about his hot girlfriend
to the residence hall staff.

16:20.729 --> 16:23.732
-Yeah.
-I think he's getting coffee on Ventura.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.818
-What?
-Okay, so…

16:26.318 --> 16:28.278
I so happened to stumble
upon Addison's Insta,

16:28.362 --> 16:29.947
not that I look at it a lot or anything,

16:30.030 --> 16:32.116
but they just went live from Dark Roast,

16:32.199 --> 16:34.785
and you can see Des
in the reflection of their sunglasses.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.622
What the hell?

16:40.749 --> 16:44.253
<i>Hey! How's Stanford going? Send a pic!</i>

16:46.964 --> 16:49.383
<i>It's beautiful here!</i>
<i>I love the architecture.</i>

16:49.466 --> 16:52.261
Oh my God, what an asshole.
We have to confront him!

16:52.344 --> 16:55.014
I wish I could,
but if I miss my costume fitting,

16:55.097 --> 16:58.517
Jonah will dress me
in gasoline-soaked rags. His words.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.937
I'll come with you,
and not just because Addison's there,

17:02.021 --> 17:03.063
because I'm a good friend.

17:09.611 --> 17:13.032
Well, well, well. I heard that Stanford
had a sprawling campus,

17:13.115 --> 17:16.410
but I didn't realize that it reached
all the way down to Southern California!

17:16.493 --> 17:17.536
Devi, I can explain.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.789
Explain what? That you and your mom
decided to break up with me,

17:20.873 --> 17:22.291
but you didn't want to let me know?

17:22.374 --> 17:25.335
Yeah, you had a pretty
public conversation at my school,

17:25.419 --> 17:27.212
and I got eyes everywhere.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.923
Devi, I'm sorry I lied to you. I…

17:30.466 --> 17:33.260
I just didn't know what to do. I mean,
I really don't want to break up--

17:33.343 --> 17:35.804
-Then don't!
-I can't go against her. She's my mom!

17:35.888 --> 17:38.849
I go against my mom,
like, 40 times a day. It's fine.

17:38.932 --> 17:41.935
Look, Devi, you're cool and all,

17:42.561 --> 17:45.022
but, like, dating you
isn't worth pissing off my mom.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.776
-I mean, she still pays for my phone.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.033
Devi!

17:57.201 --> 17:58.952
Devi Vishwakumar, come with me.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.417
-Come on.
-See ya.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.464
Seat taken?

18:20.974 --> 18:22.643
Hey, bro, what's up?

18:23.477 --> 18:24.311
Nothing.

18:24.812 --> 18:28.065
Okay. Anything you want to talk about?

18:29.566 --> 18:34.238
I just wanted to say that I'm cool
with you going to Arizona

18:34.321 --> 18:35.364
on one condition.

18:36.031 --> 18:36.865
What's that?

18:36.949 --> 18:38.992
You're not allowed
to make a new…

18:39.076 --> 18:41.620
…best friend there.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.455
Dude…

18:48.502 --> 18:51.588
Never. No one can take your place, bro.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.006
You're my number one boy.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.050
Bring it in, my sweet prince.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.302
Yeah!

18:57.803 --> 19:00.514
Guess I'll need some Mentos
to remember you by.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.517
-I think you mean mementos.
-Oh!

19:05.936 --> 19:07.980
That's my warming jacket for swimming.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.815
Signature Paxton.

19:09.898 --> 19:10.941
Looks good.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.068
Oh, sick!

19:13.152 --> 19:14.570
-I'll take these too.
-Okay.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.573
Oh, I suppose I should leave you
with something of mine.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.409
No, you don't have to do that, man.
It's fine--

19:25.581 --> 19:27.332
-Thanks, man.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.918
Look, you know I'll come back
to visit a lot, right?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.378
You and I will always be friends.

19:31.461 --> 19:34.506
Yeah, Eleanor said the same thing.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.800
She's really dope. Don't mess that up.

19:43.223 --> 19:46.185
Hi, Nal.
We have a little bit of a situation.

19:46.685 --> 19:50.647
I just witnessed Devi throw coffee
directly into my son's face.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.107
Uh, it was iced coffee.

19:52.191 --> 19:56.403
Still, I think it's best we pump
the brakes on this relationship.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.071
As much as I love Devi--

19:58.155 --> 20:00.115
You don't love me.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.575
I heard what you said.

20:02.075 --> 20:05.787
She told Des to break up with me
because I "had a lot of problems."

20:05.871 --> 20:06.872
You did?

20:06.955 --> 20:09.499
-I never said that, all I said--
-Mom.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.126
Just admit it.

20:13.128 --> 20:16.089
Okay. Yes, I suggested
that Des end things,

20:16.173 --> 20:19.509
but I was just thinking
of what's best for both of our kids.

20:19.593 --> 20:23.347
Do you really think Devi
is a danger to your son?

20:23.430 --> 20:25.307
Well, she did throw coffee in his face.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.683
Iced coffee.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.811
Look, Nal, I appreciate
what you and Devi have been through,

20:29.895 --> 20:32.397
but you said it yourself,
his future is so bright.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.942
I don't want anything
to get in the way of that.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.318
Rhyah,

20:36.401 --> 20:39.947
how dare you come to my house
and talk about my daughter this way?

20:40.948 --> 20:42.991
Devi does not have problems.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.535
She's just been through
something unimaginable

20:45.619 --> 20:50.207
that would break someone as flimsy as you
in an instant, and she has persevered.

20:50.290 --> 20:53.043
How can you talk to me like that, Nalini?

20:53.126 --> 20:55.629
I mean, I have been
such a great friend to you.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.547
You don't think of me as a friend.

20:57.631 --> 21:01.385
You think of me as a project
that you can, uh, feed seeds to.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.761
Fine. If that's how you feel,

21:02.844 --> 21:05.764
then I guess I'll take someone else
to Jessica Alba's baby food tasting.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.976
Fantastic. Now, if you'll excuse me,

21:09.059 --> 21:12.354
I need to eat a bag
of heavily processed Bugle chips.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.147
Wow!

21:19.987 --> 21:21.154
I really am sorry.

21:22.572 --> 21:23.407
Me too.

21:39.673 --> 21:43.135
Devi, you okay?

21:47.347 --> 21:48.307
Mm-hmm.

21:49.182 --> 21:51.393
Thanks for ripping Rhyah a new one.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.644
She deserved it.

21:53.979 --> 21:58.108
Listen, I'm really sorry about Des.
I know you were excited about that.

21:58.191 --> 21:59.359
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

22:00.736 --> 22:04.531
I actually thought for a second that
I was gonna be able to live a normal life,

22:04.614 --> 22:06.908
but I guess I'm too much
of a freak for that.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.703
You're not a freak.
Don't listen to a word of what Rhyah said.

22:09.786 --> 22:12.789
Mom, she's not completely wrong, you know.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.125
I am kind of a lot.

22:16.501 --> 22:17.794
Before the concert…

22:19.129 --> 22:21.256
…I thought I saw Dad in the audience.

22:23.717 --> 22:26.303
That's okay. I see him everywhere.

22:26.970 --> 22:30.515
Once I thought I saw him cut me off
in traffic, and I followed that man home.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.059
Damn.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.437
Um…

22:41.651 --> 22:43.320
What if, um…

22:44.363 --> 22:48.408
What if nobody ever loves me
because I'm always too much?

22:48.492 --> 22:50.452
Oh, Devi.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.538
Listen to me.

22:54.956 --> 22:57.626
You're never too much,
and you're always enough.

22:59.628 --> 23:03.090
And one day, you will find someone
who loves you exactly as you are,

23:03.590 --> 23:04.674
just like I do.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.057
I love you too, Mom.

23:15.477 --> 23:18.146
Now, come downstairs,

23:18.230 --> 23:21.691
and we can watch our <i>Property Brothers</i>
install a waterfall island.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.195
Okay.

23:42.170 --> 23:45.507
So, has your back
always been shaped this way?

23:46.258 --> 23:48.009
Why? Is it deformed?

23:48.093 --> 23:48.927
No!

23:50.679 --> 23:54.015
Your back is perfect.
Just like the rest of you.

23:54.599 --> 23:55.851
-Damn!
-Damn!

23:55.934 --> 23:59.438
Eleanor, forgive me
for I have been a dick or whatever.

24:00.021 --> 24:01.690
You were right about Paxton.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.025
If you love something,
let it go to Arizona.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.610
Oh, that's beautiful.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.320
I can say goodbye to Paxton

24:08.071 --> 24:10.824
because everything I need is right here.

24:10.907 --> 24:13.702
Jonah, you better start working
on a new bodice

24:13.785 --> 24:15.829
because this one's about to get shredded.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.374
Jesus, can't you wait two minutes?

24:35.348 --> 24:39.019
No, seriously, at one point,
we were growling at each other.

24:39.102 --> 24:40.145
-What?

24:40.228 --> 24:42.147
El, I am so happy for you.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.649
I just can't believe
you did it in the drama room.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.610
I mean, it shouldn't be that shocking.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.528
I've done some of my best work there.

24:48.612 --> 24:51.656
But also, I know
you're nursing a broken heart, Devi.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.701
-And we don't have to talk about it.
-Of course, we have to talk about it.

24:54.784 --> 24:57.078
This is like the biggest news
our friend group has ever had.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.789
People say your first time
is supposed to be awkward,

24:59.873 --> 25:03.251
but we were perfectly in sync
like a nude pair's ice-skating team.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.421
It's also crazy
that you lost your virginity standing up.

25:06.505 --> 25:11.259
It honestly felt so natural for us.
I can't imagine ever lying down.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.304
Uh, hey, guys,
I have to take care of something.

25:14.387 --> 25:15.847
-Find you later?
-Yeah.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.725
How do you have sex standing up?

25:20.268 --> 25:21.686
Uh, hey.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.856
Wait, are you drawing?

25:24.940 --> 25:27.901
Yeah, if you must know,
I do it to relieve my stress.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.402
Is there something you need?

25:29.903 --> 25:31.571
I'm really sorry about what I said.

25:32.989 --> 25:35.075
You were right. Des broke up with me.

25:36.701 --> 25:37.536
Sorry to hear that.

25:38.411 --> 25:40.705
Uh, listen,
I don't think you're miserable.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.999
You're more like
a lovable crank.

25:43.083 --> 25:46.002
-This apology's really bad.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah, sorry.

25:46.086 --> 25:49.756
Look, I just lashed out at you
because I was embarrassed.

25:49.839 --> 25:53.760
I could tell I was headed towards
yet another massive romantic failure.

25:54.928 --> 25:58.098
It's okay. If it's any consolation,
I think you dodged a bullet.

25:58.181 --> 26:00.433
-Moms like that only get worse with time.
-Hmm.

26:00.517 --> 26:04.896
Well, when I die a virgin,
tell people it wasn't for lack of trying.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.273
You're not gonna die a virgin.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.316
Mmm, I don't know, man.
It's not looking good.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.111
If you're still a virgin on your deathbed,
I'll come have sex with you.

26:11.194 --> 26:13.280
-Oh, really? You'd do that?
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

26:13.363 --> 26:16.157
Even if I'm an old bag of bones
with milky eyes and no teeth?

26:16.241 --> 26:19.244
Yeah, sure, but don't be alarmed
if I still look great.

26:19.327 --> 26:20.620
Men age better.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.706
Here, good for one free boink.

26:23.582 --> 26:27.043
Great. Yeah, this definitely
makes me feel less pathetic.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.712
Mmm. You're welcome.

26:29.212 --> 26:31.381
What you drawing? Is that a cactus?

26:32.048 --> 26:33.967
What? No! It's… It's Eric.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.764
<i>Although Devi</i>
<i>had weathered the humiliation</i>

26:39.848 --> 26:41.975
<i>of being dumped by her boyfriend's mom,</i>

26:42.058 --> 26:43.602
<i>she knew she'd be okay.</i>

26:43.685 --> 26:47.188
<i>She would find love again.</i>
<i>She just had to look to the future.</i>

26:47.272 --> 26:49.149
-Yo. Guess what?
-Mmm?

26:49.232 --> 26:50.525
I'm going to ASU.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.068
-Oh my God, really?
-Wow!

26:52.152 --> 26:54.279
<i>Or maybe to the past.</i>

26:54.362 --> 26:56.781
<i>XOXO, John McEnroe.</i>
