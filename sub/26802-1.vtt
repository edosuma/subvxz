01:26.327 --> 01:27.570
- Too close.

01:27.604 --> 01:29.054
- Well, that's what we
get for being ass deep

01:29.089 --> 01:30.883
on Kaiser Bill's
side of the line.

01:30.918 --> 01:33.403
- Why do we always
get the easy jobs?

01:33.438 --> 01:34.956
- Don't know.

01:34.991 --> 01:36.717
Maybe it's Colonel Foley's
way of saying he loves us.

01:38.926 --> 01:43.689
All right, let's move out.

01:54.735 --> 01:55.805
- Copy that.

02:03.951 --> 02:05.642
- Keeper of the fairies.

02:05.677 --> 02:07.265
Keeper of the secrets.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.646
- Colonel Schneider.

02:10.681 --> 02:12.201
Sir.

02:12.235 --> 02:14.272
We've been ordered to fall back.

02:20.450 --> 02:21.486
- I summon you.

02:26.939 --> 02:28.355
- My God.

02:28.389 --> 02:31.185
As keeper of this amulet,

02:34.292 --> 02:35.465
I order you,

02:35.500 --> 02:37.329
come forth, child of darkness,

02:37.364 --> 02:38.813
and do my bidding.

02:41.230 --> 02:42.058
It's happening.

02:46.338 --> 02:49.203
- Colonel!

02:54.174 --> 02:55.485
- All right, this is the spot.

02:55.520 --> 02:56.314
Wolf, pinpoint.

02:56.348 --> 02:57.349
Collins, cover the rear.

02:57.384 --> 02:58.626
- Got you covered.

02:58.661 --> 03:00.110
- Sir.

03:00.145 --> 03:00.939
- Sargent?

03:01.871 --> 03:03.010
- It's too quiet.

03:03.873 --> 03:05.288
I don't like it.

03:05.323 --> 03:06.910
- Well, you can take that
up with Colonel Foley.

03:06.945 --> 03:09.189
This is the target.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.017
Move out.

03:26.171 --> 03:26.999
- Colonel!

03:31.418 --> 03:33.316
- Wolf, take the pride
and clear the room.

03:33.351 --> 03:36.181
Collins, maps, documents,
everything comes with us.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.320
- Yes, Sergeant.

04:42.558 --> 04:43.628
- Lieutenant?

04:47.183 --> 04:48.011
Sir?

04:49.944 --> 04:50.773
You okay?

04:54.190 --> 04:55.881
- I've had better days, Collins.

05:03.544 --> 05:04.683
- Lieutenant.

05:04.718 --> 05:06.271
Sir.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.342
Colonel Foley asked
me to see you, sir.

05:25.255 --> 05:27.292
- Lieutenant McNamara
reporting as ordered, sir.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.397
- At ease, Lieutenant.

05:31.227 --> 05:32.780
I heard you lost a man tonight.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.750
- More than one, sir.

05:36.784 --> 05:38.303
- Well, I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

05:39.684 --> 05:41.479
Those spooks are going over
the intel you gathered,

05:41.513 --> 05:43.619
and we should know soon
enough just how valuable

05:43.653 --> 05:44.792
it may turn out to be.

05:46.000 --> 05:46.829
- Yes, sir.

05:49.176 --> 05:50.971
- It's not all bad
news, Lieutenant.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.870
The krauts are
growing desperate.

05:56.839 --> 05:59.324
Rumor has it that the
German high command

05:59.359 --> 06:00.360
is talking surrender,

06:02.327 --> 06:03.811
so with any luck,

06:03.846 --> 06:06.711
this whole damn, cursed war
could be over by Christmas.

06:09.299 --> 06:10.853
- Very happy to hear that, sir.

06:11.681 --> 06:12.510
- Good.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.272
Good work out there at any case.

06:18.999 --> 06:19.827
- Yes sir.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.209
- Dismissed.

06:34.497 --> 06:35.705
- The shellings stopped.

06:37.293 --> 06:38.121
It's so quiet.

06:40.054 --> 06:41.090
It's almost peaceful.

06:42.954 --> 06:43.782
- Almost.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.032
- That a picture of
your girl, Lieutenant?

06:58.348 --> 06:59.419
- My wife, Josephine.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.662
- She's very pretty, sir.

07:02.594 --> 07:03.423
- She is.

07:09.808 --> 07:10.947
- What's that you're reading?

07:10.982 --> 07:13.156
- I'm not readin' nothin'.

07:14.295 --> 07:16.505
I have no idea what kind
of language this is.

07:19.715 --> 07:22.338
I took it off the kraut that
Lieutenant killed today.

07:25.168 --> 07:25.997
- It's in German.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.068
- No.

07:29.725 --> 07:31.761
No, I've never seen
words like these before.

07:31.796 --> 07:34.212
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir?

07:34.246 --> 07:37.042
- Did I hear that right? You
found that on the raid tonight?

07:37.077 --> 07:38.285
- I did, sir.

07:38.319 --> 07:39.320
- Why, then, did
you not turn it in

07:39.355 --> 07:41.495
with the rest of the intel?

07:41.530 --> 07:43.117
- Wasn't necessarily
an intel, Lieutenant.

07:43.152 --> 07:45.879
It's some kind of story
book or somethin'.

09:04.854 --> 09:06.062
- Your bag, ma'am.

09:06.097 --> 09:08.686
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:13.622 --> 09:14.830
- Miss McNamara?

09:16.072 --> 09:17.246
- I am.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.627
- Name's Jimmy,
I'll be your escort.

09:18.661 --> 09:19.524
- Oh.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.562
Very nice to meet you, James.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.804
- Only two women call me James,

09:23.839 --> 09:26.427
my mother and Sister
Rafus, so please,

09:26.462 --> 09:27.290
Jimmy.

09:28.844 --> 09:30.017
- Jimmy.

09:30.052 --> 09:31.363
- Right this way.

09:56.665 --> 09:58.736
- Adelia.

09:58.770 --> 10:01.117
Come on, I need to get
my knitting needles.

10:04.362 --> 10:05.466
Adelia, please.

10:12.508 --> 10:14.441
Why are you locking the doors?

10:14.475 --> 10:16.477
You know what Sister
Rafus will say.

10:16.512 --> 10:17.547
- I need to show you something.

10:17.582 --> 10:18.410
Close the door.

10:26.867 --> 10:28.144
- What are you doing?

10:28.179 --> 10:29.629
- This is alchemy.

10:30.940 --> 10:32.321
- What's alchemy?

10:32.355 --> 10:33.633
- Miss Lena told me about it.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.186
She gave me this box.

10:35.220 --> 10:36.877
She says, "Those
who master alchemy

10:36.912 --> 10:38.534
"can use it for all
sorts of things.

10:38.568 --> 10:40.570
"Potions to heal, to sleep,

10:40.605 --> 10:42.089
"to make a boy love you."

10:43.953 --> 10:47.198
- What, like magic?
- Yes, exactly.

10:47.232 --> 10:49.338
Here, let me show you.

10:49.372 --> 10:51.029
"Love and healing magic:

10:51.064 --> 10:52.721
"two parts willow tree bark,

10:52.755 --> 10:54.688
"one pinch of rosemary,

10:54.723 --> 10:57.484
"a dash of dried apple
ground into a paste.

10:57.518 --> 11:00.383
"In small doses, it will
heal infection and fever."

11:02.006 --> 11:04.491
- "Fairy Guardian Conjuring:

11:04.525 --> 11:07.874
"call upon the fairies in
the darkness of light."

11:09.116 --> 11:10.704
Fairies?

11:10.739 --> 11:11.532
Really, Adelia?

11:11.567 --> 11:13.258
You shouldn't bother--

11:13.293 --> 11:14.535
- What are you two about?

11:14.570 --> 11:16.330
- Nothing free to
bother with, Ida.

11:22.992 --> 11:25.201
- Henrietta and Adelia,

11:25.236 --> 11:26.755
why are you not at choir?

11:26.789 --> 11:27.721
- I'm so sorry, Sister.

11:27.756 --> 11:29.516
We were just about to leave.

11:29.550 --> 11:31.311
- What's that you're reading?

11:31.345 --> 11:32.174
- Oh, nothing.

11:32.208 --> 11:34.624
It's a book I found.

11:34.659 --> 11:35.902
- Give it here.

11:40.838 --> 11:44.117
"Secrets of the Fairies.

11:44.151 --> 11:45.566
"Potions.

11:45.601 --> 11:46.636
"Remedies."

11:50.157 --> 11:51.469
Really, now?

11:51.503 --> 11:53.367
Where do you find
such rubbish, girls?

11:54.644 --> 11:55.853
Oh, you need not answer.

11:55.887 --> 11:57.889
This is Miss Lena's
doing, is it not?

12:00.029 --> 12:00.858
Oh, never mind.

12:01.859 --> 12:03.826
You've each earned a demerit.

12:03.861 --> 12:06.829
Adelia, I believe this
is your second this week.

12:06.864 --> 12:08.900
- It wasn't Henrietta's
fault, she was just--

12:08.935 --> 12:10.419
- Silence, child.

12:11.351 --> 12:12.179
- Yes, sister.

12:14.009 --> 12:15.665
- Off to choir now, both of you.

12:16.666 --> 12:17.737
- Yes, Sister.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.297
- What's it about, Sister?

12:26.331 --> 12:28.230
- Never you mind, Ida.

12:28.264 --> 12:29.679
- Very well.

12:29.714 --> 12:31.440
Is there anything more
I can help you with?

12:32.475 --> 12:33.304
- Yes.

12:34.512 --> 12:36.583
You can go to choir
with everyone else.

12:38.033 --> 12:38.827
- Yes, Sister.

13:22.871 --> 13:24.113
- New teacher.

13:24.148 --> 13:25.666
- Really?

13:28.186 --> 13:29.636
Well, let me see.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.642
Oh yeah.

13:36.643 --> 13:38.679
Yeah, she'd do in a pinch.

13:38.714 --> 13:39.991
- In a pinch?

13:40.026 --> 13:41.199
- Oh, never mind.

14:07.398 --> 14:08.226
- Good heavens,

14:08.261 --> 14:09.400
what happened here?

14:09.434 --> 14:10.401
- Something at
breakfast didn't sit

14:10.435 --> 14:11.712
well with this young one.

14:14.060 --> 14:15.924
- And, why are you
cleaning it up?

14:15.958 --> 14:17.235
- It's no bother, Sister.

14:18.719 --> 14:20.169
- Your duties are to keep clean

14:20.204 --> 14:22.206
the kitchens and the lavatories.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.277
The children are
responsible for their rooms.

14:24.311 --> 14:25.588
- Kitchen's clean,

14:25.623 --> 14:26.796
same with the privies.

14:26.831 --> 14:28.177
- Nonetheless,

14:28.212 --> 14:31.491
we strive to teach personal
responsibility here.

14:32.941 --> 14:35.598
Lena, stop this at once,

14:37.014 --> 14:39.257
and stand and face me
when I address you.

14:43.952 --> 14:45.436
- How may I be of service?

14:45.470 --> 14:48.749
- You can start by
explaining this.

14:48.784 --> 14:50.475
I found Adelia with it,

14:50.510 --> 14:52.512
and I can only guess
that it was you

14:52.546 --> 14:53.789
that gave it to her.

14:54.652 --> 14:56.171
- It's just a bit of fun, ma'am.

14:56.205 --> 14:57.344
It's harmless enough.

14:57.379 --> 14:59.450
- Potions and spells,

14:59.484 --> 15:00.969
it's blasphemy.

15:01.003 --> 15:04.075
I won't have the children
exposed to such indignity.

15:04.110 --> 15:06.457
I tolerate your peculiarities,

15:06.491 --> 15:08.459
because you have a
way with the children,

15:08.493 --> 15:12.325
but there are limits I will
not allow you to press.

15:13.291 --> 15:14.983
Have I made myself clear?

15:16.294 --> 15:17.226
- You have, Sister.

15:19.435 --> 15:21.472
- Excuse me, Sister,

15:21.506 --> 15:22.922
but the young woman is here.

15:24.406 --> 15:27.512
The history teacher from
Tulsan, Miss Josephine McNamara.

15:27.547 --> 15:28.582
- Oh, yes.

15:28.617 --> 15:29.549
Where is she?

15:29.583 --> 15:31.482
- In Father Timothy's office.

15:31.516 --> 15:32.345
- Very well.

15:45.703 --> 15:46.773
Miss McNamara.

15:47.808 --> 15:48.637
- Yes,

15:49.845 --> 15:51.951
but it's Mrs. McNamara.

15:53.435 --> 15:54.643
Sister?

15:54.677 --> 15:55.713
- Mary Rafus.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.761
Oh, please, sit.

16:16.113 --> 16:17.700
- Excuse me,

16:17.735 --> 16:21.256
I was told I'd be meeting
with Father Timothy.

16:21.290 --> 16:24.604
He and I have been corresponding
by mail for some time now.

16:24.638 --> 16:26.157
- It was I who
wrote those letters

16:26.192 --> 16:27.503
in the good Father's name.

16:28.470 --> 16:30.782
Oh, there's nothing amiss.

16:30.817 --> 16:33.061
Father Timothy is very old,

16:33.095 --> 16:35.166
and his health is fading,

16:35.201 --> 16:37.203
and he's vested me
with those burdens

16:37.237 --> 16:39.446
now beyond his
capacity to manage.

16:40.344 --> 16:41.483
- I see.

16:41.517 --> 16:42.725
- Does that trouble you?

16:43.726 --> 16:46.902
- Not at all, ma'am, Sister.

16:46.936 --> 16:47.799
- Sister will do.

16:49.353 --> 16:50.940
- Yes, Sister.

16:50.975 --> 16:52.839
- And, what of your husband?

16:52.873 --> 16:54.358
Would he approve of his pretty,

16:54.392 --> 16:57.154
young wife tending a
gaggle of unfortunates?

16:57.188 --> 16:59.673
- Well, I'm sure he
will once I tell him.

17:02.159 --> 17:06.369
Patrick is a kind-hearted man,

17:07.819 --> 17:10.994
and I expect he will commend
my decision to work here.

17:12.376 --> 17:16.414
Only, it's been some time since
I've received news from him,

17:16.449 --> 17:21.074
as he's stationed in
France near the front.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.179
- He's a soldier?

17:23.490 --> 17:24.733
- Yes.

17:24.767 --> 17:25.596
- I see.

17:28.461 --> 17:29.910
May God protect him.

17:51.656 --> 17:53.037
- What do you
think you're doing?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.797
- Sitting down to eat.

17:54.832 --> 17:56.420
- Not here, you're not.

17:56.454 --> 17:58.353
- There's
plenty of room.

18:00.009 --> 18:01.183
- I prefer to dine alone.

18:03.082 --> 18:03.875
Thank you.

18:23.205 --> 18:24.379
- Not hungry, Violet?

18:25.345 --> 18:26.622
- Not for this.

18:27.485 --> 18:29.177
- It's not that bad today.

18:31.834 --> 18:34.492
- I wish we could say the
same thing about the company.

18:35.528 --> 18:37.012
Don't look at him.

18:37.046 --> 18:38.634
Maybe he won't bother us.

18:39.739 --> 18:40.912
- Hey, Adelia.

18:40.947 --> 18:43.225
Had another dream
about you last night.

18:43.260 --> 18:44.157
You were naked.

18:44.192 --> 18:46.366
- You're a pig, Jack Larson.

18:46.401 --> 18:47.540
- This never works,

18:47.574 --> 18:49.266
but you never stop trying.

18:49.300 --> 18:50.508
- I'm persistent.

18:50.543 --> 18:51.578
I thought women liked
that kind of thing.

18:51.613 --> 18:52.821
- Not this one.

18:52.855 --> 18:54.271
- Well, how about
you, Henrietta?

18:54.305 --> 18:57.550
- Not even if you
were as rich as Midas.

18:59.379 --> 19:00.208
- There's Bram.

19:02.071 --> 19:03.211
Let's go mess with him.

19:03.245 --> 19:04.660
- Why don't you just
leave him alone?

19:04.695 --> 19:07.422
- Why don't you worry
about yourself, Adelia?

19:08.561 --> 19:09.665
What do you say, Jack?

19:10.977 --> 19:12.185
- I'm sorry, my lovelies,

19:12.220 --> 19:14.153
but we're gonna have
to continue this later.

19:19.986 --> 19:21.367
Whatcha reading, bubbsy?

19:21.401 --> 19:22.851
- Who you foolin'?

19:22.885 --> 19:24.197
Boy can't read.

19:24.232 --> 19:26.475
- I like to
look at the pictures.

19:26.510 --> 19:27.821
- Are there any nudies in there?

19:27.856 --> 19:28.788
- Give me that.

19:32.378 --> 19:33.965
You look like you wanna hit me.

19:35.104 --> 19:36.382
Go ahead.

19:36.416 --> 19:37.486
Do it.

19:37.521 --> 19:39.005
I want you to.

19:39.039 --> 19:41.732
- No, I think he's gonna cry.

19:41.766 --> 19:43.182
- That right?

19:43.216 --> 19:44.355
You gonna cry?

19:45.943 --> 19:48.842
See, his brain's not
all that soft about him.

19:54.020 --> 19:56.195
On this floor, we have
have our dormitory,

19:56.229 --> 19:58.231
two children to a room.

19:59.370 --> 20:00.199
- Fight, fight!

20:03.202 --> 20:04.030
- No, Jack!

20:04.064 --> 20:05.825
- Get this freak off me!

20:07.930 --> 20:10.174
- I'm getting Sister Rafus.

20:13.798 --> 20:15.973
Sister, Rafus, come quickly.
- What's come over you, child?

20:16.007 --> 20:17.250
- A brawl in the dining room.

20:25.983 --> 20:27.398
- Enough of this.

20:29.262 --> 20:32.196
- But, he's the one that
started this, Sister, I swear.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.853
- That's not true. All
he was doing was reading

20:33.887 --> 20:35.406
when they started
laying into him.

20:35.441 --> 20:36.614
- Yeah, it's true. We
saw the whole thing.

20:36.649 --> 20:38.823
- Silence, everyone.

20:38.858 --> 20:41.826
What sort of cowardice is
it to beat a boy two-on-one?

20:44.035 --> 20:45.105
Help him up, girls.

20:49.075 --> 20:50.525
I don't know who started this,

20:50.559 --> 20:52.768
but both of you boys have
just earned a demerit.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.979
Go and take Bram
to Sister Martha.

21:00.017 --> 21:02.709
And, the rest of you go
back to eating your lunches.

21:06.610 --> 21:09.923
Still sure you want
the job, Mrs. McNamara?

21:22.971 --> 21:26.112
- We were supposed to
take him to Sister Martha.

21:26.146 --> 21:28.010
- What could Sister Martha do?

21:28.045 --> 21:29.218
The woman's half blind.

21:33.326 --> 21:34.327
- There.

21:34.362 --> 21:35.224
Let that sit.

21:36.156 --> 21:37.917
- What is it?

21:37.951 --> 21:40.126
- Just a recipe of my own.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.817
- It stinks.

21:41.852 --> 21:43.716
- I know,

21:43.750 --> 21:44.682
but it heals,

21:44.717 --> 21:46.546
and that's the important part.

21:46.581 --> 21:49.066
By morning, it'll be as
if it never happened.

21:49.100 --> 21:49.894
- Really?

21:52.552 --> 21:53.726
- How do you feel, Bram?

21:54.934 --> 21:56.970
- Like I
just got trampled on.

21:58.489 --> 22:01.147
- From what I hear, I'm
told you were very brave.

22:01.181 --> 22:02.804
- Brave?
- Mm hmm,

22:03.943 --> 22:05.772
and that you walloped
that Virgil good.

22:07.774 --> 22:10.087
- Yeah, and if Jack
didn't blindside you,

22:10.121 --> 22:11.330
it would be him in here.

22:12.952 --> 22:14.056
- I wouldn't help him.

22:15.092 --> 22:16.507
- Why not?

22:16.542 --> 22:17.612
- Boy's a bully,

22:18.682 --> 22:19.855
and just like you,

22:19.890 --> 22:21.719
I've been fightin'
him off my whole life.

22:21.754 --> 22:25.205
- Really?

22:25.240 --> 22:26.068
- Really.

22:29.382 --> 22:30.521
Now, you all better
get out of here

22:30.556 --> 22:32.454
before Sister Rafus
gets wise to us.

22:35.112 --> 22:37.183
Keep Bram out of her
sight until morning.

22:38.771 --> 22:40.117
- Thanks, Lena.

22:40.151 --> 22:42.740
- Yes,
thank you.

22:42.775 --> 22:44.190
- You're very welcome, Bram.

Quite so.

McNamara's personal things.

first day on the job.

- Think
she'll be leaving us now?

35:47.214 --> 35:48.387
- Of course.

35:48.422 --> 35:50.217
How could she stay after
something like that?

35:54.531 --> 35:56.361
- I liked her.

35:57.741 --> 35:59.398
- But, you didn't know her.

36:01.193 --> 36:02.090
None of us did.

36:03.644 --> 36:04.817

a way about her.

37:42.674 --> 37:44.676
or talk to someone,

37:44.710 --> 37:46.298
or anything at all,

37:47.748 --> 37:49.474
my door is always open.

37:53.063 --> 37:54.375
- Thank you, Father.

37:56.653 --> 37:57.654
Perhaps later.

37:58.897 --> 38:00.278
- Yes, of course.

38:23.853 --> 38:24.681
- Ida,

38:25.579 --> 38:26.407

Really?

38:31.481 --> 38:32.862
Still with that damn book?

- I can leave if you want.

38:38.971 --> 38:39.800
- Sorry.

38:42.458 --> 38:45.599
It's just, I'm needing
some affection.

38:45.633 --> 38:47.083
- Shut up, Billy.

38:49.672 --> 38:50.949
- What is that, anyway?

38:50.983 --> 38:52.330
- It's ancient writing,

38:52.364 --> 38:53.192
pagan letters.

38:54.124 --> 38:55.194
- And, the other one?

38:58.991 --> 39:00.545
Ancient alphabets,

39:01.442 --> 39:05.653
translations and definitions.

39:05.688 --> 39:07.275
Where did you get these?

39:07.310 --> 39:08.207
- Quiet.

39:08.242 --> 39:09.139
I'm trying to concentrate.

39:15.560 --> 39:19.080
- You swiped those from
that old drunk's library?

39:24.258 --> 39:25.604
- There.

39:25.639 --> 39:27.365
I think I can make it out now.

39:29.574 --> 39:30.747
- Make what out?

39:30.782 --> 39:33.474
The hell are you talking about?

39:43.519 --> 39:44.451
Come again?

39:54.668 --> 39:55.462
You're a witch.

39:55.496 --> 39:56.463
- You really think so?

39:57.705 --> 39:59.707
- Yeah, I'm out of here.

40:01.468 --> 40:02.296
- Me too.

40:10.649 --> 40:11.823
- What's that?

40:14.791 --> 40:15.620
- Billy?

40:17.104 --> 40:17.932
Come on out.

40:22.592 --> 40:23.835
This isn't funny, Billy.

41:54.339 --> 41:55.305
- Who's he?

41:57.411 --> 41:59.482
- I heard he arrived
in the dead of night.

42:00.863 --> 42:03.313
- He has a strange
way about him.

42:03.348 --> 42:06.040
- Guess he's not hungry.

42:06.075 --> 42:07.732
- Guess not.

42:07.766 --> 42:09.665
- But, there's something else.

42:09.699 --> 42:11.701
No one can find Ida.

42:11.736 --> 42:13.979
- Maybe she flew away
on her broomstick.

42:15.636 --> 42:17.914
- I heard
she ran off with a boy.

42:19.191 --> 42:20.641
- A boy?

42:20.676 --> 42:21.953
Who?

42:21.987 --> 42:24.921
- Some townie she's been
sneaking off to see.

42:24.956 --> 42:27.510
- Ida, miss teacher's pet?

42:27.545 --> 42:29.408
- That's what they say.

42:39.211 --> 42:41.559
- Are you not hungry, child?

42:42.939 --> 42:45.528
Would you follow me then
to Father Timothy's office?

42:45.563 --> 42:47.357
We have much to discuss.

43:01.509 --> 43:02.718
- Operator.

43:02.752 --> 43:06.169
- Yes, may I have the
train station, please?

43:06.204 --> 43:08.033
- Hold, please.

43:09.725 --> 43:12.762
- Yes, when does the
next train depart?

43:13.970 --> 43:15.800
- It's
Christmas Eve, ma'am,

43:15.834 --> 43:17.318
and you've just
missed the last one

43:17.353 --> 43:18.596
until after the holidays.

43:19.907 --> 43:20.736
- I see.

43:25.395 --> 43:26.224
Thank you.

43:45.036 --> 43:46.175
- "And, from this time,

43:46.209 --> 43:48.384
"being the age before
the dawn of man,

43:48.418 --> 43:49.661
"the spirits of old,

43:49.696 --> 43:52.664
"the gods of elemental
power over the universe,

43:52.699 --> 43:54.045
"the servants of the divine,

43:54.079 --> 43:57.186
"where the fairies had
conjured a being of pure evil.

43:57.220 --> 43:59.257
"They called this
beast the Krampus."

44:13.271 --> 44:14.375
- Have a seat, please.

44:19.622 --> 44:20.485
Very well.

44:35.051 --> 44:36.708
What can you tell
me of yourself?

44:41.437 --> 44:42.852
You can start with a name.

44:45.613 --> 44:46.442
Who are you?

44:48.547 --> 44:50.515
Are you unable to--
- Nicholas.

44:55.209 --> 44:56.107
- Nicholas.

45:01.112 --> 45:02.527
And, what is your last name?

45:03.528 --> 45:05.150
- Nicholas is my name.

45:07.808 --> 45:08.947
- No last name?

45:11.294 --> 45:12.364
Where are you from?

45:15.402 --> 45:17.197
- Where do you think
you're going, Lena?

45:17.231 --> 45:18.577
- Get out of my way, please.

45:18.612 --> 45:20.303
I need to speak
with Sister Rafus.

45:22.236 --> 45:24.687
Sister, I must warn you.

45:24.722 --> 45:25.999
- What's come over you?

45:26.033 --> 45:28.208
- We're, all of us, in
the greatest of danger.

45:35.629 --> 45:37.286
- Lena, good heavens.

45:54.096 --> 45:55.166
- Lena?

45:55.200 --> 45:56.823
- What's wrong with her?

45:56.857 --> 45:58.307
- She's running a fever,

45:58.341 --> 46:00.343
but there's something else.

46:00.378 --> 46:02.345
- Something else?

46:02.380 --> 46:05.072
- She hasn't opened her
eyes since she collapsed.

46:06.625 --> 46:09.111
- Is there anything we
can do to help, sister?

46:09.145 --> 46:10.768
- You can pray for her,

46:10.802 --> 46:13.494
and stay out of
Sister Martha's way.

46:13.529 --> 46:14.702
- Yes, Sister.

46:14.737 --> 46:16.843
- Do you hear me, Adelia?

46:16.877 --> 46:17.740
- Yes.

46:19.846 --> 46:21.433
- Let's go, children.

46:21.468 --> 46:22.987
We need to let Lena sleep.

46:39.210 --> 46:40.038
- Sister?

46:41.212 --> 46:43.110
- Mrs. McNamara.

46:43.145 --> 46:45.733
I thought Jimmy was taking
you to the train station.

46:45.768 --> 46:48.115
- No more are running
until after the holiday.

46:48.150 --> 46:49.737
- I'm sorry.

46:49.772 --> 46:52.464
You should be with family
after receiving such news.

46:54.501 --> 46:57.504
- Perhaps you have some work

46:57.538 --> 46:59.713
I could do to keep
myself occupied?

47:01.094 --> 47:03.821
Anything I could do to
help you or Sister Martha?

47:04.822 --> 47:07.928
Perhaps something of Lena's?

47:07.963 --> 47:10.241
I know she's taken ill.

47:10.275 --> 47:11.587
- I really think it's best--

47:11.621 --> 47:12.760
- No, please, Sister.

47:14.038 --> 47:15.453
Any task,

47:15.487 --> 47:17.041
anything at all.

47:17.075 --> 47:19.457
Scrubbing floors would be heaven

47:19.491 --> 47:22.356
compared to sitting
in my room alone.

47:25.566 --> 47:28.776
- Some of the children are
decorating the Christmas tree.

47:28.811 --> 47:30.157
I'm sure they would be grateful

47:30.192 --> 47:32.884
to have someone tall
enough helping them.

47:34.506 --> 47:35.542
- Very well, Sister.

47:37.820 --> 47:38.614
Thank you.

47:44.827 --> 47:46.587
Oh, hello, young man.

47:48.106 --> 47:49.280
- You've been crying,

47:49.314 --> 47:50.212
but not for Lena?

47:53.940 --> 47:55.907
Who is it you cry for,

47:55.942 --> 47:56.735
your husband?

47:58.876 --> 48:00.325
He was a soldier, was he not?

48:03.156 --> 48:04.778
- He was, yes.

48:05.710 --> 48:07.125
- Then, why the tears?

48:07.160 --> 48:09.093
Soldiers die all the time.

48:44.645 --> 48:47.062
- Okay, now you sound
warning if you see anyone.

48:48.615 --> 48:49.685
- Why?

48:49.719 --> 48:50.858
And, what are we doing here?

48:50.893 --> 48:53.689
I thought we were
going to see Henrietta.

48:53.723 --> 48:54.483
- No.

48:54.517 --> 48:55.933
Well, not yet, anyway.

48:57.244 --> 48:59.108
Just stand here, Bram, okay?

48:59.143 --> 49:00.627
Keep your voice down low.

49:00.661 --> 49:02.111
It'll be okay,

49:02.146 --> 49:04.493
just call out to me if you
see Sister Rafus or anybody.

49:48.951 --> 49:53.749
- Do you even know how Santa
manages to visit us every year

49:53.783 --> 49:55.509
when we have such
a little chimney?

49:55.544 --> 49:57.891
- That's how he comes
in, through the chimney.

49:57.925 --> 49:59.582
- But, he's so fat,

49:59.617 --> 50:00.825
how does he fit?

50:02.689 --> 50:03.931
- He's magical.

50:07.211 --> 50:09.282
- I know she's mean
most of the time,

50:09.316 --> 50:10.490
but I'm worried about Ida.

50:10.524 --> 50:12.009
- Is that the girl
who's missing?

50:14.321 --> 50:16.254
I hear she ran away with a boy.

50:16.289 --> 50:19.050
- She does that every night
when she thinks I'm sleeping.

50:19.085 --> 50:20.983
She always comes back.

50:26.506 --> 50:27.576
- What?

50:27.610 --> 50:29.923
You wanna make
somethin' of it, shrimp?

50:29.957 --> 50:31.718
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

50:31.752 --> 50:33.202
- Virgil tripped the new boy.

50:33.237 --> 50:34.238
- I did not such thing.

50:34.272 --> 50:35.480
- That will be quite enough.

50:35.515 --> 50:37.344
- Can you just leave
it alone, Virgil?

50:38.690 --> 50:40.554
- Sleep tight tonight, kid.

50:48.597 --> 50:49.391
- Okay.

50:53.050 --> 50:53.947
Here we go.

50:57.019 --> 50:57.916
- Truly, Adelia?

50:58.986 --> 51:00.126
You locked me out again?

51:02.749 --> 51:04.371
- Lock it behind her, please.

51:04.406 --> 51:05.648
- The book Lena gave you.

51:06.822 --> 51:09.238
Sister Rafus gave
it back to you?

51:09.273 --> 51:10.998
- Not exactly.
- Adelia, you shouldn't be--

51:11.033 --> 51:12.862
- We need to help Lena.

51:12.897 --> 51:14.105
Whatever's wrong with her,

51:14.140 --> 51:16.142
I doubt it's anything
Sister Martha can cure.

51:16.176 --> 51:19.110
This book, it's full of recipes.

51:19.145 --> 51:20.007
Let's see,

51:20.042 --> 51:22.803
gifts of mother goddess,

51:22.838 --> 51:24.702
the healing arts,

51:25.634 --> 51:27.877
amending a broken bone.

51:27.912 --> 51:29.016
No.

51:30.259 --> 51:32.779
To restore a person's
sense of smell,

51:32.813 --> 51:34.574
well, no.

51:34.608 --> 51:35.816
Oh, here.

51:35.851 --> 51:37.577
To awaken someone from
an unnatural sleep,

51:37.611 --> 51:38.785
use one part rosemary,

51:38.819 --> 51:39.682
one part sage,

51:39.717 --> 51:41.063
one part lavender,

51:41.098 --> 51:43.548
and one tail of a
needful creature.

51:44.756 --> 51:46.931
- What's
a needful creature?

51:48.174 --> 51:50.279
- It looks like a rat.

51:50.314 --> 51:51.867
- Yeah, that's it.

51:51.901 --> 51:55.181
- There's a lot
of rats at the back house.

51:55.215 --> 51:57.735
I can go get them.

51:57.769 --> 51:59.150
- I'll come with you.

51:59.185 --> 52:01.290
- Please be careful, you two.

52:13.716 --> 52:14.545
- Jimmy.

52:16.236 --> 52:17.306
- Father?

52:17.341 --> 52:18.514
- Drop of the creature?

52:20.137 --> 52:21.897
- Blow her away for me.

52:23.795 --> 52:25.521
- Timing couldn't
be better for me.

52:32.114 --> 52:33.322
Good afternoon, Sister.

52:33.357 --> 52:34.185
- Father,

52:35.497 --> 52:38.396
and my sense of smell
hasn't faded with age,

52:38.431 --> 52:40.812
so there's no need
for pageantry.

52:48.061 --> 52:50.650
It is with you, James,
that I wish to speak.

52:50.684 --> 52:52.341
- All ears, Sister.

52:52.376 --> 52:54.205
- I'm worried about Ida.

52:54.240 --> 52:56.242
Sally tells me she's
been sneaking off

52:56.276 --> 52:58.209
to see that Miller boy again,

52:58.244 --> 53:00.349
but it's not like
her not to come back.

53:01.695 --> 53:02.524
- Young love.

53:04.111 --> 53:05.837
- I want you to go into town

53:05.872 --> 53:08.046
and inquire after
her whereabouts.

53:08.081 --> 53:09.979
Start with that Miller boy.

53:10.014 --> 53:11.118
Find out where he is,

53:11.153 --> 53:12.465
and if she's with him,

53:12.499 --> 53:14.467
tell her we only
wish her to return,

53:14.501 --> 53:15.778
and all will be forgiven.

53:17.815 --> 53:19.575
Well, she'll have to
be punished, actually,

53:19.610 --> 53:22.268
but we will forgive her.

53:24.787 --> 53:25.616
After all,

53:26.824 --> 53:28.205
I was young once myself.

53:31.553 --> 53:32.381
What?

53:34.176 --> 53:35.177
- Didn't say a word.

53:39.699 --> 53:41.114
- I'll be off then.

53:41.148 --> 53:42.288
- Happy hunting.

53:43.841 --> 53:45.912
- Good day, dear Father.

54:03.205 --> 54:06.277
- Where's your stocking,
Mrs. Josephine?

54:06.312 --> 54:08.762
- Time for bed now, little ones.

54:08.797 --> 54:11.558
You don't want to be awake
when Santa Claus arrives.

54:11.593 --> 54:13.422
- But, it's so early.

54:13.457 --> 54:15.148
- Wait, what was that?

54:16.322 --> 54:17.978
Did you hear that,
Mrs. McNamara?

54:19.497 --> 54:21.085
- I think I did.

54:21.119 --> 54:23.260
- Sounds like reindeer.

54:24.261 --> 54:26.124
Not very far, wouldn't you say?

54:26.159 --> 54:29.645
- Very close.

54:33.339 --> 54:34.271
- Nicholas.

54:38.930 --> 54:40.380
It's time for bed now, child.

55:00.780 --> 55:02.299
- Is it ready yet?

55:05.232 --> 55:06.061
- I think so.

55:15.519 --> 55:17.141
- Did you find out anything?

55:18.487 --> 55:19.316
- Nothing.

55:20.455 --> 55:21.939
I found the boy's father,

55:21.973 --> 55:24.286
but he hasn't seen or heard
from him since yesterday.

55:25.460 --> 55:28.463
My guess is the two of
them ran off together.

55:28.497 --> 55:30.257
- Oh, that's just not like her.

55:32.259 --> 55:34.365
- You think you
know people, but--

55:35.987 --> 55:38.783
- It's
been such a trying day,

55:38.818 --> 55:41.303
what with this news of
Mrs. McNamara's husband,

55:41.338 --> 55:42.718
and Ida running off,

55:42.753 --> 55:45.065
and that strange
child, Nicholas,

55:45.100 --> 55:46.619
just arriving at our door.

55:48.655 --> 55:51.624
- I can widen my
search tomorrow,

55:52.970 --> 55:54.178
check the surrounding towns,

55:54.212 --> 55:56.007
see if anyone's
taken sight of them.

55:57.457 --> 55:59.459
- Tomorrow is
Christmas day, James,

55:59.494 --> 56:01.703
and your place is here with us.

56:01.737 --> 56:04.430
It saddens me that Ida
has forgotten hers,

56:04.464 --> 56:06.639
but that was her choice.

56:09.745 --> 56:10.574
- Good night, Sister.

56:10.608 --> 56:11.609
- Good night, James.

56:13.439 --> 56:14.957
- It's not working.

56:14.992 --> 56:16.856
- Well, maybe we're
not doing it right.

56:16.890 --> 56:19.237
What does the book say again?
- Apply it to the fingertips

56:19.272 --> 56:21.274
of the one that's
lost its slumber,

56:21.308 --> 56:22.758
but nothing's happening.

56:22.793 --> 56:24.104
- Are you sure
we're doing this right?

56:24.139 --> 56:25.658
- Adelia, we need to hurry.

56:25.692 --> 56:27.280
Sister Martha will be
starting head count soon,

56:27.314 --> 56:28.419
and if we're not in
our rooms, you know--

56:28.454 --> 56:29.972
- I know!

57:23.647 --> 57:25.303
- Where's Bram?

57:25.338 --> 57:26.304
- Don't know,

57:26.339 --> 57:27.513
but if I were you,

57:27.547 --> 57:30.170
I'd go check Adelia
and Henrietta's room.

57:33.553 --> 57:34.830
- Adelia, Bram!

57:37.454 --> 57:39.007
- It's not gonna work, Adelia.

57:39.041 --> 57:40.871
- Bram!

57:42.528 --> 57:45.289
- The Sisters
are looking for us.

57:45.323 --> 57:46.324
- Henrietta?

57:47.705 --> 57:49.293
Adelia?

58:16.078 --> 58:18.356
What are you children
doing in here?

58:18.391 --> 58:19.979
- We're--

58:23.465 --> 58:25.018
- Stay with me, girls.

58:33.164 --> 58:34.856
- What was that noise?

58:34.890 --> 58:37.893
- It sounded like
Jack and Virgil.

58:45.073 --> 58:45.901
- It's happening?

58:48.455 --> 58:49.664
- What's happening?

58:52.529 --> 58:53.357
- He's here.

58:54.876 --> 58:55.670
- Virgil?

58:55.704 --> 58:57.016
- Jack?

59:00.260 --> 59:01.538
- Bram, give me that book.

59:11.168 --> 59:12.790
- Lena, what is happening?

59:14.343 --> 59:15.241
- Lena?

59:18.382 --> 59:19.279
- Spirits of light,

59:19.314 --> 59:20.280
shield us from the darkness,

59:20.315 --> 59:21.868
by not the forces of evil.

59:21.903 --> 59:24.388
- They need help.

59:24.422 --> 59:26.079
- No, Bram! Don't go.

59:26.114 --> 59:27.184
Girls, take my hands.

59:28.323 --> 59:29.738
Bram, you, too. We
need to form a circle.

59:29.773 --> 59:31.395
- Why do we need
to form a circle?

59:31.429 --> 59:34.363
- Just do what I say
and repeat after me.

59:34.398 --> 59:37.021
- Spirits of light, shield
us from the darkness.

59:37.056 --> 59:42.061
- Spirits of light,
shield us from the darkness.

59:45.720 --> 59:47.445
- What is that?

59:47.480 --> 59:49.620
- Don't look, just repeat
after me, keep going!

59:49.655 --> 59:54.176
- Spirits of light,
shield us from the darkness.

01:01:02.969 --> 01:01:05.247
- They told me you didn't--

01:01:19.123 --> 01:01:20.297
Am I dreaming?

01:01:24.301 --> 01:01:26.130
- Yeah, yeah, you are.

01:01:28.788 --> 01:01:30.790
Not all dreams are lies.

01:01:31.757 --> 01:01:32.723
Oh, my love.

01:01:38.867 --> 01:01:41.111
Josephine, you need to hear me.

01:01:44.079 --> 01:01:46.323
You and everyone in this
house are in danger.

01:01:47.531 --> 01:01:49.050
- What?
- For a lot of them,

01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:51.466
for many of them, it's already
too late, but if you act now,

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.330
you can still save the children.

01:01:53.364 --> 01:01:57.990
- I don't understand.
- I know.

01:01:59.163 --> 01:02:01.648
I'm sorry. You have
to wake up now.

01:02:01.683 --> 01:02:03.305
You have to wake up now.

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.341
I'm sorry.
- No.

01:02:04.375 --> 01:02:05.376
- I'm sorry.

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:09.760
Look to the amulet.
It'll protect you.

01:02:09.795 --> 01:02:12.211
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:02:12.245 --> 01:02:13.764
You have to wake up.
- No, no, no!

01:02:13.799 --> 01:02:15.559
- You have to wake up.

01:02:15.593 --> 01:02:17.009
- No, don't leave me!

01:03:24.904 --> 01:03:25.732
Jimmy!

01:03:25.767 --> 01:03:27.527
- Mrs. McNamara.

01:03:27.562 --> 01:03:31.048
- Father Timothy.

01:03:34.431 --> 01:03:36.157
What's happened here?

01:03:37.606 --> 01:03:38.435
- A beast.

01:03:39.677 --> 01:03:42.335
A demon from the bowels of hell.

01:03:44.959 --> 01:03:46.132
- I need to get you help.

01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:47.306
I have to.

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.583
- No, no,

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.758
Josephine, listen to me.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.832
It's taken the children.

01:03:55.866 --> 01:03:56.660
- What?

01:03:57.730 --> 01:03:58.524
No.

01:04:01.458 --> 01:04:02.597
Where, where?

01:04:04.185 --> 01:04:06.083
- Into the inferno.

01:04:10.225 --> 01:04:11.054
Josephine,

01:04:11.986 --> 01:04:14.954
you must help the children.

01:04:16.749 --> 01:04:17.577
- How?

01:04:18.509 --> 01:04:19.338
How?

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:21.892
How do I help them?

01:04:23.066 --> 01:04:28.002
- You--

01:04:28.036 --> 01:04:28.865
- Father.

01:04:30.038 --> 01:04:30.867
Father!

01:04:31.798 --> 01:04:32.799
Father!

01:04:32.834 --> 01:04:34.284
Father!

01:04:34.318 --> 01:04:38.598
- Spirits of light,
shield us from the darkness.

01:04:48.505 --> 01:04:49.402
- Lena?

01:04:49.437 --> 01:04:50.231
Children?

01:04:53.959 --> 01:04:55.305
- Is he gone?

01:04:56.582 --> 01:04:58.135
- No,

01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:00.137
but I think for now, we're safe.

01:05:03.451 --> 01:05:04.590
Where did you get that?

01:05:07.489 --> 01:05:09.871
- It was among my
husband's things.

01:05:12.529 --> 01:05:13.392
- What is it?

01:05:14.669 --> 01:05:15.946
- It's the weapon we need.

01:05:17.258 --> 01:05:20.537
- For what?

01:05:20.571 --> 01:05:23.298
Just what is this
thing we're fighting?

01:05:24.299 --> 01:05:25.197
- The Krampus.

01:05:34.896 --> 01:05:35.724
- Lena!

01:05:36.794 --> 01:05:37.692
Lena! Lena!

01:05:38.555 --> 01:05:39.832
Lena!

01:05:46.356 --> 01:05:48.323
- It's stuck.

01:06:19.044 --> 01:06:19.976
- Nicholas?

01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:37.372
- The handle's red hot.

01:06:37.407 --> 01:06:38.304
- It's evil magic.

01:06:38.339 --> 01:06:40.168
I need to find a counter spell.

01:07:03.364 --> 01:07:05.262
- Keeper of the amulet,

01:07:06.574 --> 01:07:08.024
greetings.

01:07:13.098 --> 01:07:14.064
- What are you?

01:07:17.343 --> 01:07:22.107
- A traveler.

01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:26.904
- I don't understand.

01:07:28.975 --> 01:07:33.980
- I come from a
world long forgotten,

01:07:35.844 --> 01:07:40.849
locked away by the fairies
into that cursed book,

01:07:47.304 --> 01:07:49.824
since before the age of man,

01:07:52.344 --> 01:07:56.520
until I was set free.

01:07:57.763 --> 01:08:01.870
For that, I am thankful.

01:08:06.461 --> 01:08:08.256
- Set free? How?

01:08:09.602 --> 01:08:11.535
- It was the girl.

01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:13.296
You called her Ida.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.647
She freed me from my prison.

01:08:23.513 --> 01:08:25.100
- Where is she?

01:08:25.135 --> 01:08:27.103
- I've taken her,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.072
and all the other's young ones

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.385
I found in this place.

01:08:37.216 --> 01:08:38.390
- Taken them where?

01:08:38.424 --> 01:08:42.187
- Into the inferno,

01:08:44.085 --> 01:08:46.191
the realm of fire,

01:08:46.225 --> 01:08:51.229
that lies between this
world and the next,

01:08:51.988 --> 01:08:53.094
my home,

01:08:54.268 --> 01:08:58.788
and the source of my power.

01:09:00.964 --> 01:09:05.969
A power that grows ever stronger

01:09:07.591 --> 01:09:11.939
with every child
I confine there.

01:09:20.121 --> 01:09:21.604
- And, the others?

01:09:22.848 --> 01:09:26.162
Sister Rafus and Sister Martha?

01:09:26.196 --> 01:09:28.923
Jimmy and Father Timothy?

01:09:30.821 --> 01:09:33.134
You murdered them!

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:34.515
Why, why?

01:09:34.549 --> 01:09:38.104
- For the same
reason the huntsman

01:09:38.139 --> 01:09:42.005
slays the deer or the wolf,

01:09:42.038 --> 01:09:47.044
devours its prey.

01:09:50.703 --> 01:09:52.636
- What are you saying?

01:09:52.671 --> 01:09:56.675
It's in your nature
to murder us?

01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:58.608
- To punish you,

01:09:59.988 --> 01:10:01.576
that is my purpose,

01:10:03.578 --> 01:10:05.718
to take from you the children

01:10:06.926 --> 01:10:10.965
and act as harbinger
to the darkness

01:10:10.999 --> 01:10:16.004
that will follow my return.

01:10:22.321 --> 01:10:24.323
- There has to be something,

01:10:24.358 --> 01:10:27.188
some way that we can--

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:28.051
- No.

01:10:29.086 --> 01:10:30.502
There is nothing.

01:10:31.813 --> 01:10:32.642
Prepare.

01:10:43.204 --> 01:10:44.654
- Goddess of water,

01:10:44.688 --> 01:10:45.724
mother,

01:10:45.758 --> 01:10:47.346
life-giver,

01:10:47.381 --> 01:10:48.416
I call upon you.

01:10:59.772 --> 01:11:01.602
- Oh, shit.

01:11:01.636 --> 01:11:03.431
- Children, just as before,

01:11:03.466 --> 01:11:04.363
once more,

01:11:04.398 --> 01:11:05.468
we need to combine our energy.

01:11:05.502 --> 01:11:06.331
Come on.

01:11:07.332 --> 01:11:08.229
Repeat after me.

01:11:14.615 --> 01:11:15.823
Again.

01:11:25.246 --> 01:11:26.489
- It's working!

01:11:26.523 --> 01:11:27.904
- Focus, again children.

01:11:43.057 --> 01:11:43.989
Bram, get the book.

01:11:48.269 --> 01:11:49.926
- What is it you're
waiting for, then?

01:11:51.445 --> 01:11:53.032
- Foolish mortal,

01:11:53.930 --> 01:11:55.552
so eager to die.

01:12:00.523 --> 01:12:02.007
- Tell her the truth, Krampus.

01:12:03.388 --> 01:12:04.320
You can't hurt her.

01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:07.115
She's the bearer of the amulet.

01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:08.703
- This is the true.

01:12:10.464 --> 01:12:12.466
You, on the other hand--

01:12:24.167 --> 01:12:25.789
Death to you.

01:12:25.824 --> 01:12:27.550
- Give me the amulet.

01:12:34.211 --> 01:12:36.800
- Lena!

01:12:51.194 --> 01:12:52.644
We'll all be okay.

01:12:52.678 --> 01:12:54.231
- Lena said the amulet
can be used to defeat him.

01:12:54.266 --> 01:12:55.336
Maybe we can use it
to open the door.

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:56.164
- How?

01:12:56.199 --> 01:12:57.269
- Give it to me.

01:13:06.451 --> 01:13:07.244
- He's coming!

01:13:07.279 --> 01:13:08.107
- Hurry!

01:13:17.807 --> 01:13:19.395
- Okay, okay.

01:13:19.429 --> 01:13:21.500
I need
to catch my breath,

01:13:21.535 --> 01:13:23.399
and where are we even
running to, anyways?

01:13:23.433 --> 01:13:25.642
- As far away as we can
get from that demon.

01:13:25.677 --> 01:13:26.471
Let's keep going.

01:13:26.505 --> 01:13:27.610
- No.

01:13:27.644 --> 01:13:29.094
We have the power,

01:13:29.128 --> 01:13:29.922
the power to defeat it.

01:13:29.957 --> 01:13:30.751
Lena told us so.

01:13:30.785 --> 01:13:32.442
- Lena didn't make it.

01:13:32.477 --> 01:13:33.857
- No, the power's in the amulet.

01:13:33.892 --> 01:13:34.962
All we need to do is use it.

01:13:34.996 --> 01:13:35.859
- How do we do that?

01:13:35.894 --> 01:13:36.688
- The book.

01:13:36.722 --> 01:13:37.620
- It's useless.

01:13:37.654 --> 01:13:38.828
She didn't even translate.

01:13:38.862 --> 01:13:40.416
- Wait, give it to me!

01:13:41.727 --> 01:13:42.797
Okay.

01:13:42.832 --> 01:13:44.903
- You think you can read it?

01:13:44.937 --> 01:13:46.111
- Ancient German.

01:13:46.145 --> 01:13:47.595
Ancient German,

01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:48.838
runic!

01:13:48.872 --> 01:13:50.115
- No one understands that.

01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:51.047
- No, wait.

01:13:51.081 --> 01:13:52.289
It's starting to make sense!

01:13:52.324 --> 01:13:53.463
- Really?

01:13:53.498 --> 01:13:54.913
- Yeah.
I told Sister Rafus I wanted

01:13:54.947 --> 01:13:56.293
the chance to
practice my studies.

01:13:56.328 --> 01:13:57.433
Well, here it is.

01:13:59.089 --> 01:14:00.366
"Krampus Origins,

01:14:01.402 --> 01:14:03.784
"A Tale From the Fairies."

01:14:03.818 --> 01:14:04.819
- Amazing.

01:14:04.854 --> 01:14:06.476
- How do we stop it?

01:14:06.511 --> 01:14:10.687
- "Creation of the Krampus,"

01:14:10.722 --> 01:14:12.171
no.

01:14:12.206 --> 01:14:15.830
"Summoning and
summoning stones."

01:14:15.865 --> 01:14:17.798
- He's coming.

01:14:17.832 --> 01:14:19.593
Hurry up, hurry up, come on.

01:14:19.627 --> 01:14:20.525
- Hurry!

01:14:29.326 --> 01:14:31.087
- Give me the amulet.

01:14:32.157 --> 01:14:35.332
Josephine!

01:15:36.083 --> 01:15:38.016
- Josephine, Josephine!

01:16:05.077 --> 01:16:07.148
- Do you hear that, children?

01:16:07.183 --> 01:16:08.184
- Of course.

01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:12.637
- You're back.

01:16:12.671 --> 01:16:13.672
- It's gone.

01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:16.192
Be careful.

01:16:27.065 --> 01:16:27.997
- Let's go.

01:16:39.422 --> 01:16:41.182
- What if somebody finds it?

01:16:43.529 --> 01:16:45.704
- We can only hope
that day never comes.

01:17:00.098 --> 01:17:01.996
I wish I knew you
better, Sister,

01:17:05.517 --> 01:17:09.314
but your life's work lives
on through these children.

01:17:12.317 --> 01:17:17.322
I have no doubt they will grow
up to be fine men and women.

01:17:20.981 --> 01:17:22.361
Most of them, anyway.

01:17:27.712 --> 01:17:28.471
- Hey, Bram.

01:17:28.505 --> 01:17:29.437
- What do you want?

01:17:30.611 --> 01:17:31.819
- Adelia told us what you did,

01:17:31.854 --> 01:17:34.788
how you and her helped
out Miss McNamara,

01:17:34.822 --> 01:17:35.720
and destroyed that thing,

01:17:35.754 --> 01:17:37.514
and brought us all back.

01:17:42.623 --> 01:17:43.935
- I did everything I could,

01:17:43.969 --> 01:17:46.075
but it's Miss Lena you
should be thanking.

01:17:48.008 --> 01:17:49.250
- If only we could.

01:17:49.285 --> 01:17:51.667
- Look, I guess what
we're trying to say

01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:54.600
is that we're really sorry
about how we made sport of you.

01:17:56.844 --> 01:17:57.673
And--

01:17:57.707 --> 01:17:59.985
- And, if we could,

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:02.643
we'd like a chance to
start over as friends.

01:18:06.164 --> 01:18:06.992
Friends?

01:18:10.789 --> 01:18:11.652
- Why not?

01:18:12.515 --> 01:18:13.827
- Thanks, Bram,

01:18:13.861 --> 01:18:14.759
and Merry Christmas.

01:18:14.793 --> 01:18:16.657
- It was Christmas yesterday.

01:18:17.589 --> 01:18:18.486
- Yeah, well,

01:18:18.521 --> 01:18:20.385
I guess we kinda missed it.

01:18:20.419 --> 01:18:21.248
- Yeah.

01:18:25.321 --> 01:18:26.149
- Hey, Bram,

01:18:27.323 --> 01:18:28.773
whatever happened
to your stutter?

01:18:30.084 --> 01:18:30.913
- Don't know.

01:19:06.155 --> 01:19:09.365
- Those are very pretty flowers.

01:19:09.399 --> 01:19:10.711
I'm sure Lena would agree.

01:19:11.885 --> 01:19:12.989
- It was her favorite.

01:19:14.370 --> 01:19:15.543
She used to say the flowers

01:19:15.578 --> 01:19:17.718
continued the magic
of the fairies.

01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:23.172
Hey, you loved them all,

01:19:23.206 --> 01:19:25.968
but I'm gonna miss
Lena the most.

01:19:29.281 --> 01:19:31.628
- Well, she's in good
company, at least.

01:19:37.462 --> 01:19:40.948
I hope she and Sister Rafus

01:19:40.983 --> 01:19:43.261
can get on better in heaven

01:19:43.295 --> 01:19:45.573
than they ever
did here on earth.

01:19:45.608 --> 01:19:49.681
Maybe Father Timothy
and Jimmy can help

01:19:49.715 --> 01:19:51.062
try to loosen her up a bit.

01:19:52.857 --> 01:19:54.030
- That's unlikely.

01:20:00.312 --> 01:20:01.797
And, your husband?

01:20:04.006 --> 01:20:04.834
- Yes.

01:20:07.630 --> 01:20:08.804
Patrick was his name.

01:20:11.392 --> 01:20:12.221
- Patrick.

01:20:13.291 --> 01:20:14.775
You'll see him again one day.

01:20:18.883 --> 01:20:19.711
- I will.

01:20:22.956 --> 01:20:24.958
Just as you'll see
Lena again one day.

01:20:31.896 --> 01:20:32.758
Oh,

01:20:33.656 --> 01:20:35.451
I almost forgot.

01:20:35.485 --> 01:20:36.832
I have something for you.

01:20:40.283 --> 01:20:41.319
- The amulet?

01:20:42.768 --> 01:20:44.184
But, it was your husband's.

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:48.740
- It belongs with a girl
who understands magic,

01:20:48.774 --> 01:20:52.882
and I am the farthest
thing from that.

01:20:58.474 --> 01:20:59.440
- Thank you.

01:21:01.926 --> 01:21:03.789
- You're very welcome.
