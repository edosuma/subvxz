00:39.917 --> 00:43.041
Good. Could you go drop an
N.G. tube on the patient in 234

00:43.125 --> 00:45.041

I'm supposed to be up in intensive care.

Good. We just turfed him there.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.083
(J.D.) <i>Look, I became a doctor</i>

01:14.458 --> 01:16.250

01:16.333 --> 01:18.250
The hospital doesn't want to be sued.

Being sued is not a good thing.

Here's the thing, Tupac, DMX, Dr. Dre...

01:40.834 --> 01:41.959
In most of their songs,

01:42.041 --> 01:44.792
these artists use an extremely
volatile racial slur,

01:45.500 --> 01:46.333
the "n" word...

01:46.417 --> 01:47.250
-I got it.
-Right.

01:47.333 --> 01:50.208
My question is this,
if we're both singing along,

01:50.291 --> 01:52.667
and knowing that otherwise
I would never use the word,

01:52.750 --> 01:54.792
-am I allowed to say--
-No.

01:54.875 --> 01:57.125
See, that's good for me to know.
I... I didn't know that.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.375
Finally, Doctors, if there is a mistake,

02:00.458 --> 02:02.834
don't admit it to the patient.

02:02.917 --> 02:05.917
Of course, if the patient is deceased,

02:06.041 --> 02:08.333
and you're sure,

02:08.417 --> 02:13.333
you can feel free to tell him
or her anything.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.083
Okay, gang... I'm Dr. Bob Kelso,
and I'm your chief of medicine.

02:24.166 --> 02:25.750
So, I just want to encourage you all

02:25.834 --> 02:28.458
to think of me as your safety net.

02:28.542 --> 02:32.542
Because I promise you we're a family here.

02:32.625 --> 02:35.875
Now, then, go get 'em, doctors.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.792
The surgical interns
are gonna go grab a beer.

02:38.875 --> 02:41.333
The medical interns
are having a Pac-Man tournament.

02:41.417 --> 02:43.041
Apparently, we're all 12.

02:43.125 --> 02:44.667
-(chuckles)
-I love Pac-Man.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.667
Me, too. I love watching it.
I love playing it.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.208
I love all of it.

02:50.625 --> 02:51.542
I'm Elliot.

02:51.625 --> 02:53.500
(E.T. voice) Elliot...

02:53.583 --> 02:54.792
Yeah. Don't do that.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.667
I'm J.D. This is Turk.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.375
Elliot, you medical or surgical?

02:59.458 --> 03:00.500
Medical.

(J.D.) <i>Ha-ha. Hello.</i>

My dad, my granddad, my brother.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.834
Guess that's why my dad
gave me a guy's name,

03:08.917 --> 03:10.667
made me play sports, date girls.
I'm joking.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.917
I know. I would have laughed
if you'd paused.

03:14.542 --> 03:17.083
Anyway, I know what you're thinking.

-Yeah.

04:28.542 --> 04:29.625

-Why?

04:39.125 --> 04:40.667
Carla, can I ask you a personal question?

04:40.750 --> 04:42.625
Do you spray the perfume on

04:42.709 --> 04:45.417
or just fill the bathtub up
and splash around in it?

04:45.500 --> 04:46.625

(whistles)
Time's up.

04:53.041 --> 04:55.250
Carla, would you do it for him?
I also need an A.B.G.

-Why are you telling her?
-Shut up and watch.

04:57.041 --> 04:58.333
Be nice to Bambi.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.083
That's a little insensitive.

Aww, that is so sweet.

05:13.458 --> 05:14.709

What about his subconscious?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.166
Eisenhower was a sissy.

Oh, and from now on,
whenever I'm in the room,

05:28.750 --> 05:30.667
you're definitely not allowed to talk.

05:33.709 --> 05:38.041

can you tell me what ailment...

05:38.125 --> 05:39.291
(J.D.) <i>I think I'm gonna love rounds.</i>

<i>A whole lot.</i>

05:55.959 --> 05:58.291
Dr. Reid, you're late.

05:58.375 --> 06:00.250
I got puked on.

06:00.333 --> 06:01.583
You're off the hook if you can tell me

06:01.667 --> 06:04.291
what to look for in a uremic patient.

06:04.375 --> 06:06.583
(J.D.) <i>Anyway, I'm going for it.</i>

06:06.667 --> 06:07.834

Infection.

06:07.917 --> 06:08.792
Infection?

06:09.417 --> 06:10.625
That's my girl.

06:10.709 --> 06:11.792
Hmm.

06:11.875 --> 06:12.792
Moving on.

06:13.792 --> 06:15.250
-I knew the answer.
-I'm sure you did.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.333
I was just frazzled.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.208
How could you not be? I know. Yeah.

06:18.291 --> 06:20.750
Good. But thanks.
If there's anything I can ever do--

06:20.834 --> 06:22.542
You could let me take you
to dinner tomorrow night.

06:24.542 --> 06:27.500
Around 7:00? Or 8:00?

06:28.667 --> 06:29.500
Why not?

06:30.709 --> 06:31.750
Nice.

06:31.834 --> 06:34.583
(J.D.) <i>"Why not?" That's what she said.</i>

<i>Daddy, why did you marry mommy?</i>

06:39.291 --> 06:42.083
<i>Well, Tiger, I gave her</i>
<i>an answer during rounds</i>

06:42.166 --> 06:43.166

06:44.709 --> 06:46.291
You're the man.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.709
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

06:58.792 --> 06:59.959
(record scratches)

07:01.083 --> 07:02.959
Did you actually just page me

07:03.041 --> 07:06.125
to find out how much Tylenol
to give to Mrs. Lenzer?

07:06.208 --> 07:08.375
I was worried it could
exacerbate the patient's--

07:08.458 --> 07:11.333
It's regular strength Tylenol.

07:11.417 --> 07:13.875
Here's what you do,
get her to open her mouth,

07:13.959 --> 07:16.417
take a handful and throw it at her.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.166
Whatever sticks,
that's the correct dosage.

07:18.250 --> 07:19.542
-But I
-And under no circumstances

07:19.625 --> 07:21.542
are you to compromise
our no-talking agreement.

07:22.834 --> 07:25.834
Dr. Kelso's always telling me,
"stay positive..."

07:25.917 --> 07:28.458
I'm gonna go ahead and say this
just as carefully as possible

07:28.542 --> 07:30.208
so I don't overstate it.

07:30.291 --> 07:34.375
Dr. Kelso is the most evil
human being on the planet

07:34.458 --> 07:37.792
and may in fact be Satan himself.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.667
It's just that this isn't really
what I expected, you know.

07:40.750 --> 07:45.250
Most of my patients are, uh... older

07:45.333 --> 07:48.583
and sort of checked out mentally.

07:48.667 --> 07:51.917
Pumpkin... That's modern medicine.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.166
Advances that keep people alive

07:54.250 --> 07:56.875
who should have died a long time ago,

07:56.959 --> 07:58.875
back when they lost what made them people.

07:58.959 --> 08:01.667
Now, your job is to stay sane enough

08:01.750 --> 08:04.208
so that when someone does come
in that you actually<i> can </i>help,

08:04.291 --> 08:06.500
you're not so brain-dead
that you can't function.

08:06.583 --> 08:09.834
For the love of God, what?

08:09.917 --> 08:12.333
It's just... Do you think we
should be talking in front of...

08:12.417 --> 08:14.041
Her? She's dead.

08:15.208 --> 08:18.417
Write this down, newbie,
if you push around a stiff,

08:18.500 --> 08:20.291
nobody'll ask you to do anything.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.000
You've been like a father to me.

08:23.083 --> 08:24.333
Fair enough. You want some real advice?

08:24.750 --> 08:27.083
If they find out the nurses are
doing your procedures for you,

08:27.166 --> 08:28.041
your ass'll be outta here

08:28.125 --> 08:29.750
so quick it'll make your head spin.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.166
(J.D.) <i>And there it is.</i>

08:31.750 --> 08:33.208
Have a terrific day.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.291
I'm not really dead.

08:39.959 --> 08:41.291
Okay, Bambi,

08:41.375 --> 08:42.834
here's Mrs. Lenzer's tox screening.

08:42.917 --> 08:45.041
(J.D.) <i>I wonder if Turk's having</i>
<i>the same experience I am?</i>

08:45.125 --> 08:46.166
I am such a stud.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.625
(J.D.) <i>Probably not.</i>

08:47.709 --> 08:50.542
This morning, I had my hands
inside of a guy's chest.

08:50.625 --> 08:52.041
I couldn't even see them.

08:52.125 --> 08:54.125
I should not be allowed
to do stuff like that.

08:55.291 --> 08:56.750
What's up?

08:56.834 --> 08:57.875
And you weren't scared?

08:57.959 --> 09:00.625
One way or another,
everyone stops bleeding.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.041
That is so deep.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.333
No, it isn't.

09:03.417 --> 09:04.625
It's a little deep.

09:04.709 --> 09:06.291
We never got to talk about the apartment.

09:06.375 --> 09:09.542
T-man! Aaahhh!
(laughing)

09:09.625 --> 09:11.625
Ha-ha! What up, boy? How you doin'?

09:11.709 --> 09:15.458
All right. Todd, J.D.
J.D., this is my man Todd.

09:15.542 --> 09:17.333
How's it going? Ow.

09:17.417 --> 09:19.166
(J.D.) <i>And like that,</i>
<i>I was back in high school.</i>

09:19.250 --> 09:21.667
<i>You see, surgical interns</i>
<i>are all slice 'em and dice 'em.</i>

09:21.750 --> 09:22.625
<i>They're the jocks.</i>

09:22.709 --> 09:25.291
<i>Medical interns, we're trained</i>
<i>to think about the body,</i>

09:25.375 --> 09:26.583
<i>diagnose, test...</i>

09:26.667 --> 09:28.083
<i>The medical interns, well...</i>

09:28.166 --> 09:29.000
You got a stain.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.083
Ah, ha-ha!

09:31.166 --> 09:32.625
(J.D.) <i>We're the chess club.</i>

09:32.709 --> 09:35.417
(lite jazz music playing)

09:35.500 --> 09:39.083
I just have bad gas.
What are you testing me for?

09:39.917 --> 09:42.667
We need to know if your gas
could be harmful to others.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.041
(dings)

09:44.709 --> 09:47.834
(J.D.) <i>He's just scared. Talk to him.</i>

09:47.917 --> 09:49.291
Look, Mr. Burski,

09:50.792 --> 09:52.792
I heard a systolic murmur in your heart,

09:52.875 --> 09:55.333
which is most likely nothing,
but if you don't let me check you out,

09:55.417 --> 09:56.500
I'm gonna worry about you all day.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.333
Then I'll do it. For you.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.208
You're a good man.

10:00.291 --> 10:02.333
(somber music playing)

10:07.834 --> 10:09.208
I'm... I'm waiting for someone.

10:10.667 --> 10:11.792
The door is broke.

10:13.250 --> 10:14.709
Every fifth time or so, it don't open.

10:14.792 --> 10:16.041
Maybe there's a penny stuck in there.

10:16.625 --> 10:17.750
Why a penny?

10:17.834 --> 10:18.709
I don't know.

10:20.583 --> 10:21.583
Did you stick a penny in there?

10:21.667 --> 10:22.792
No. I was just making small talk.

10:22.875 --> 10:24.709
If I find a penny in there...

10:25.625 --> 10:26.959
I'm taking you down.

10:28.375 --> 10:30.625
Welcome to rounds, kids.

10:30.709 --> 10:33.291
(J.D.) <i>Elliot is the only thing</i>
<i>keeping me from losing my mind.</i>

10:34.000 --> 10:35.083
<i>She's my dream girl.</i>

10:35.166 --> 10:37.250
The necrosis and infected stool

10:37.333 --> 10:40.083
most likely indicate what, Dr. Dorian?

10:40.166 --> 10:41.500
(clock ticking)

10:41.583 --> 10:44.000
(truck horn honking)

10:45.125 --> 10:46.208
I don't know.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.250
Sir, I have no idea.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.417
Dr. Reid, can you help him out?

10:51.500 --> 10:54.041
I'd say it's superior
mesenteric insufficiency.

10:54.125 --> 10:57.166
(honking)

10:57.250 --> 10:58.542
That's my girl!

10:58.625 --> 11:00.709
Patient number 2!

11:02.166 --> 11:04.917
(muttering)

11:05.000 --> 11:08.166
(reggae music playing on headphones)

11:08.250 --> 11:10.041
(J.D.) <i>Draining Mrs. Pratt's stomach fluid</i>

11:10.125 --> 11:11.041
<i>will get my spirits back up.</i>

11:11.125 --> 11:12.625
Circles for you.

11:13.208 --> 11:14.166
Shut up and do it.

11:14.792 --> 11:16.000
(J.D.) <i>Fantastic.</i>

11:16.083 --> 11:19.125
<i>Now just suck out the fluid</i>
<i>with the giant needle.</i>

11:19.208 --> 11:20.792
I think this needle's too big.
I'm gonna get a nurse.

11:20.875 --> 11:23.792
Come on, man. Learn by doing.
Learn by doing.

11:25.667 --> 11:26.750
(J.D.) <i>Why couldn't I do that?</i>

11:27.750 --> 11:29.208
<i>I hated him at that moment.</i>

11:31.792 --> 11:34.375
Okay, uh, maybe the needle
was just a little too big.

11:34.458 --> 11:36.750
-(J.D.) Oh, you think?
-What's going on down there?

11:36.834 --> 11:38.959
Nothing, ma'am. This is totally normal.

11:40.417 --> 11:41.250
So, are you gonna...

11:41.333 --> 11:42.959
Are you gonna move your stuff in or what?

11:43.041 --> 11:44.125
That's why I came by.

11:44.208 --> 11:45.875
I think it's better if we both
branched out a little.

11:45.959 --> 11:46.959
What do you think?

11:47.041 --> 11:48.375
(J.D.) <i>Tell him you think that's stupid.</i>

11:48.458 --> 11:49.417
<i>Tell him you need him.</i>

11:49.500 --> 11:52.083
Yeah. I feel the same way.

11:52.166 --> 11:56.166
(reggae music playing)

11:58.458 --> 12:02.041
So, what's it like being a young
and hotshot doctor?

12:02.125 --> 12:02.959
It's like...

12:03.041 --> 12:05.208
Did you ever go see a movie
that everyone told you was great

12:05.291 --> 12:06.792
and then because of all those expectations

12:06.875 --> 12:08.333
you ended up totally disappointed?

12:08.417 --> 12:11.959
Movies nowadays
have too many special effects.

12:12.041 --> 12:13.667
Yeah. That was pretty much my point.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.375
-(pager beeps)
<i>-</i>(J.D.) <i>My first code.</i>

12:15.458 --> 12:16.625

12:16.709 --> 12:18.542
<i>Someone's heart fails, they beep everyone.</i>

12:18.625 --> 12:20.041
<i>The first doctor in has to run the room,</i>

12:20.125 --> 12:20.959
<i>tell everyone what to do,</i>

12:21.041 --> 12:22.834
<i>basically decide</i>
<i>if the patient lives or dies.</i>

12:23.709 --> 12:24.834
<i>What, am I crazy?</i>

12:26.875 --> 12:27.792
Aah!

12:28.667 --> 12:29.959
You chicken!

12:30.041 --> 12:31.500
<i>Don't worry about the patient.</i>

12:31.583 --> 12:33.417
<i>Turk was already there...</i>
<i>Learning by doing.</i>

12:33.500 --> 12:34.917
Charged! Clear!

12:35.000 --> 12:37.625
Aah! Aah!

12:37.709 --> 12:39.458
(J.D.) <i>Plus, it turns out</i>
<i>the guy was just sleeping,</i>

12:39.542 --> 12:41.000
<i>attached to a faulty monitor.</i>

12:41.083 --> 12:42.917
I thought we cared about each other.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.250
If you didn't want to sleep with me,
you'd have done the same thing.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.542
The last thing in the world
I want to do is sleep with you now!

12:47.625 --> 12:48.542
(chuckles)

12:49.625 --> 12:51.166
(moans)
Do me right here.

12:51.792 --> 12:52.834
-Okay.
-See.

12:52.917 --> 12:53.750
Aah!

12:56.208 --> 12:57.291
(Dr. Cox) Right.

12:57.375 --> 12:58.583
Pass me a trach kit.

13:00.291 --> 13:01.291
Thanks.

13:03.375 --> 13:06.083
Our date is totally canceled! Pfft.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.417
<i>I was sitting on the floor for 2 reasons.</i>

13:12.500 --> 13:14.792
<i>One, I'd tried to lock Elliot</i>
<i>in that supply closet</i>

13:14.875 --> 13:16.959
<i>and she'd kicked me... hard.</i>

13:17.041 --> 13:18.792
<i>And 2, the on-call room was locked.</i>

13:18.875 --> 13:20.625
(thumping)

13:20.709 --> 13:23.041
Come on! I got like 10 minutes to sleep!

13:23.917 --> 13:27.417
Hey, tell me if I'm going too fast, okay?

13:27.500 --> 13:28.417
Lose the clothes.

13:32.041 --> 13:34.458
(J.D.) <i>I heard that Turk</i>
<i>was gonna move in with Todd.</i>

13:34.542 --> 13:36.834
<i>I'm surprised that high-fiving</i>
<i>freak isn't in there with him.</i>

13:37.667 --> 13:39.125
Damn, this is hot.

13:39.208 --> 13:40.500
(giggles)

13:41.083 --> 13:42.125
Nice.

13:42.208 --> 13:43.625
Your turn.

13:43.709 --> 13:46.125
No. I gotta get back, but very nice.

13:46.208 --> 13:47.625
(chuckles)

13:48.542 --> 13:49.625
Oh, hey, Bambi.

13:51.041 --> 13:53.583
So, uh, I'll call you, okay?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.083
Give me a big "ahh."

13:55.166 --> 13:56.583
-Ah.
-A big boy "ahh."

13:56.667 --> 13:57.500
Ahh!

13:57.583 --> 13:59.709
Turk practically had sex
in the on-call room.

13:59.792 --> 14:03.291
You realize, of course,
I have no idea who Turk is,

14:03.375 --> 14:05.208
but good for him.

14:05.709 --> 14:09.375
You see, Billy, it turns out
that sex is life-affirming.

14:09.959 --> 14:11.375
What do you say, champ?

14:11.458 --> 14:12.834
You got a urine sample in there for me?

14:12.917 --> 14:14.667
But I just did 5 minutes ago.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.750
I know you did, but here's the thing.

14:16.834 --> 14:18.875
I'd like you to take this cup,
put it on the ground,

14:18.959 --> 14:20.709
close your eyes and just go nuts.

14:20.792 --> 14:22.250
-What do you say?
-Cool!

14:22.333 --> 14:24.291
Atta-boy! Go get 'em, champ.

14:25.417 --> 14:26.250
Why are you here?

14:26.333 --> 14:27.917
Seems like a good kid.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.166
You're worried about being
on-call tonight, aren't you?

14:30.875 --> 14:32.083
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:32.917 --> 14:35.542
Look, worst case scenario...

14:36.083 --> 14:37.583
You kill somebody

14:37.667 --> 14:39.834
and that hangs over your head
the rest of your life,

14:39.917 --> 14:42.667
but that is the absolute
worst case scenario.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.083
Come on, look,

14:44.166 --> 14:46.792
just have the nurses do all the
stuff you're too chicken to do,

14:46.875 --> 14:48.625
which I assume covers
just about everything,

14:48.709 --> 14:50.250
and if you have a really
rough admission...

14:50.333 --> 14:51.458
-Call you?
-No!

14:51.542 --> 14:53.709
I was gonna say,
"Go hide in the closet again."

14:53.792 --> 14:56.500
-(toilet flushes)
-(Billy) Yee-haw! This is fun!

14:56.583 --> 14:57.959
(man 1) Hey, nursie!

14:58.041 --> 15:01.291
I'm a doctor, okay?
Stethoscope, beeper, got it?

15:01.959 --> 15:03.000
Relax.

15:03.083 --> 15:05.625
I just hate "darlings" and "sweethearts."

15:05.709 --> 15:07.250
You don't need to tell me how hard it is

15:07.333 --> 15:08.333
being a woman around here.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.583
Well, you're certainly
furthering the cause

15:10.667 --> 15:13.041
by wearing a thong to work and
hooking up in the on-call room.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.875
(screech)

15:14.959 --> 15:16.083
Word gets around.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.667
You talk like that,
do you even know my name?

15:19.250 --> 15:21.583
I spend every second of my life
either here

15:21.667 --> 15:22.917
or taking care of my mom,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.667
so, yeah, maybe I needed
a little closeness.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.875
I'm sure you never had a quickie
at the club, right?

15:27.959 --> 15:29.917
Or snuck some skinny
flat-butted college boy

15:30.000 --> 15:31.542
up to your sorority room.

15:31.625 --> 15:32.583
And my thong?

15:32.667 --> 15:35.125
I happen to think
it makes my ass look good

15:35.208 --> 15:36.667
and some days, I need to feel good

15:36.750 --> 15:37.750
about something around here.

15:37.834 --> 15:40.250
And you judge<i> me? </i>Well, guess what.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.875
Word does get around, Ms. Out-for-herself,

15:42.959 --> 15:45.250
so you can dump
on everyone here if you want,

15:45.333 --> 15:46.792
but you will not hurt me.

15:51.959 --> 15:54.333
Her name's Carla, by the way.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.667
-Ouch.
-(J.D.) Yeah.

15:58.333 --> 15:59.166
Carla.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.208
(lively music playing)

16:10.834 --> 16:12.250
Hey, champ.

16:12.333 --> 16:15.208
First night on call starts soon, huh?

16:15.291 --> 16:16.959
Gosh, must be excited.

16:17.041 --> 16:18.250
(J.D.) <i>Aah!</i>

16:18.333 --> 16:19.625
You betcha.

16:19.709 --> 16:20.542
(chuckles)

16:20.625 --> 16:23.709
Oh, about Mrs. Pratt.

16:23.792 --> 16:27.458
I heard you wanted to put her on
the hospital's transplant list.

16:27.542 --> 16:30.208
Just thought I'd recommend
keeping her on dialysis

16:30.291 --> 16:31.125
a little while longer.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.083
Maybe we'll get lucky.

16:32.166 --> 16:33.333
No problem, sir.

16:33.417 --> 16:36.709
Great. Have a ball... on call.

16:36.792 --> 16:38.834
(chuckles)
A little poem for you.

16:39.542 --> 16:41.291

I'll check on you every
10 minutes, Mrs. Marino, okay?

17:39.291 --> 17:41.375
I need to see you in Mr. Burski's room.

17:41.458 --> 17:43.458
Are you flirting with me?

17:44.500 --> 17:46.000
You are, aren't you?

17:48.375 --> 17:49.709
He crashed.

17:49.792 --> 17:52.125
The attending thinks
it was a pulmonary embolism.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.000
No way anyone could have caught it.

17:54.583 --> 17:56.000
Anyhow, you have to pronounce him.

17:56.083 --> 17:57.417
Why didn't anybody page me?

17:58.333 --> 18:00.542
Could you just pronounce him
so I can go home?

18:01.542 --> 18:03.166
(J.D.) <i>I'll never forget that moment.</i>

18:04.125 --> 18:06.125
<i>The way he looked exactly the same...</i>

18:07.000 --> 18:08.583
<i>only completely different.</i>

18:10.083 --> 18:12.041
<i>The shame that all I could think about</i>

18:12.125 --> 18:13.291
<i>was how hard this was for me.</i>

18:15.083 --> 18:15.917
(sighs)

18:17.875 --> 18:19.208
Time of death 0200.

<i>I just wanted to help people.</i>

18:27.125 --> 18:29.667
<i>The hardest part is how quickly</i>
<i>you have to move on.</i>

18:29.750 --> 18:31.291
Don't worry, man. You're gonna be fine.

18:33.333 --> 18:37.500
Hey. I lied before, man.
I'm scared every second.

18:38.125 --> 18:38.959
Really?

18:40.709 --> 18:42.458
It's a good thing
they make surgical masks,

18:42.542 --> 18:44.208
'cause if they didn't, everyone would know

18:44.291 --> 18:45.875
that my face is like this the whole time.

18:47.041 --> 18:48.208
(chuckles)

18:48.291 --> 18:49.959
Well, I think it's okay to be scared.

18:51.083 --> 18:53.291
I need you to tell me that
every once in a while, man.

18:53.375 --> 18:54.834
(J.D.) <i>He needs me?</i>

18:54.917 --> 18:57.166
Anyway, I just came to check up on you.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.625
See how you're doing.

18:58.709 --> 19:00.333
(J.D.) <i>Ask him to move in again.</i>

19:00.417 --> 19:02.542
You know, Turk, the offer
still stands if you want...

19:02.625 --> 19:05.667
Dude, I already took the keys
out of your bag.

19:07.792 --> 19:08.625
I love you.

19:10.291 --> 19:11.458
(snickers)

19:13.291 --> 19:15.709
(J.D.) <i>And like that, I got a second wind.</i>

19:19.834 --> 19:22.166
I'm watching you.

19:28.875 --> 19:29.959
How you holding up?

19:30.041 --> 19:32.125
(J.D.) <i>Ah, there he is. My safety net.</i>

19:32.208 --> 19:35.083
I saw that you're still pushing
to put Mrs. Pratt

19:35.166 --> 19:37.250
on the transplant list.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.333
Bad news, though, sport.

19:39.417 --> 19:41.500
She doesn't have the insurance
to cover it.

19:41.583 --> 19:44.792
Yeah, but she's like a second
away from total renal failure.

19:45.583 --> 19:49.625
Okay. Uh, did you ask the Burski family

19:49.709 --> 19:50.917
for permission to do an autopsy?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.583
They're still in there with him, so...

19:52.667 --> 19:56.041
It's a teaching hospital, son.
You gotta ask.

19:56.125 --> 19:58.291
(J.D.) <i>Just tell him</i>
<i>you can't see Mr. Burski again.</i>

19:58.375 --> 19:59.250
<i>He'll understand.</i>

19:59.333 --> 20:02.208
Sir, do you think
I could skip just this one?

20:02.291 --> 20:05.166
Why, sure, sport.

20:05.250 --> 20:08.083
(J.D.) <i>See? Every story needs a good guy.</i>

20:08.166 --> 20:12.625
In fact, why don't you just head on home?

20:12.709 --> 20:14.291
You look kinda tired.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.959
I am pretty tired.

20:16.583 --> 20:20.458
Dr. Dorian, do you not realize

20:20.542 --> 20:24.000
that you're nothing but a large
pair of scrubs to me?

20:24.709 --> 20:27.333
For God's sake, the only reason
I carry this chart around

20:27.417 --> 20:30.000
is so I can pretend to remember
your damn names.

20:30.083 --> 20:33.041
Now, look, if the patient
has insurance, you treat them.

20:33.125 --> 20:35.625
If you don't, you show them the door.

20:35.709 --> 20:38.458
And if somebody dies, you get the autopsy.

20:38.542 --> 20:40.333
You get it by rounds tomorrow morning,

20:40.417 --> 20:42.041
or I'll be scratching your name
off my chart.

20:42.125 --> 20:44.250
Are we clear? Answer me!

20:46.083 --> 20:47.125
Crystal clear.

20:48.083 --> 20:49.333
Great, sport.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.709
(J.D.) <i>I don't get it. If he's the jerk...</i>

20:54.792 --> 20:55.667
(pager beeps)

20:55.750 --> 20:56.959
<i>Then who's the good guy?</i>

20:58.750 --> 20:59.667
Car accident.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.291
Crashed in the elevator on the way up.

21:01.375 --> 21:02.667
(Dr. Cox) Gotta relieve pressure in chest.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.000
J.D., do it.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.375
(J.D.) <i>Oh, God, no.</i>

21:05.458 --> 21:07.333
Look at me. You can do this.

21:07.417 --> 21:08.500
(J.D.) <i>And I believed him.</i>

21:08.583 --> 21:09.417
Chest tube tray.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.583
<i>You know, kinda.</i>

21:12.000 --> 21:14.125
Come on, baby, let's go. Chop-chop.

21:14.208 --> 21:16.792
(J.D.) <i>You can do this.</i>
<i>You have to do this.</i>

21:16.875 --> 21:18.417
J.D., cut him or lose him.

21:19.959 --> 21:21.083
Okay, give me the tube.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.166
I can't get it through the pleura.

21:27.250 --> 21:28.458
Well, don't be gentle. Get it in there.

21:30.625 --> 21:32.083
Okay. Connect it, please, Carla.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.959
(suction)

21:36.625 --> 21:38.583
-Normal rhythm.
-No way.

21:38.667 --> 21:40.458
See? It's a piece of cake.

21:40.542 --> 21:41.750
He's your patient.

21:42.125 --> 21:42.959
You're leaving?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.333
That's your patient, doctor.

21:48.709 --> 21:50.458
Unh.
(mutters)

21:51.875 --> 21:53.250
-Go ahead.
-(giggles)

21:53.333 --> 21:54.166
That's enough.

21:54.250 --> 21:56.375
Sorry. It's a very big moment for me.

21:56.458 --> 21:57.291
Mm-hmm.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.291
(J.D.) <i>So I guess that's it for now.</i>

21:59.375 --> 22:02.166
<i>31 hours, 12 minutes and I am...</i>

22:02.250 --> 22:03.417
You finally off?

22:03.500 --> 22:06.709
Almost. I have one more really
annoying thing I gotta do.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.583
If you're talking
about the Burski autopsy,

22:08.667 --> 22:09.667
I called the family for you.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.500
They said fine,
and to thank you, and I'm sorry.

22:12.875 --> 22:14.625
They didn't say that last part, I did.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.417
(J.D.) <i>The worst part</i>
<i>was knowing right then</i>

22:16.500 --> 22:17.625
<i>that I could never forgive her.</i>

22:20.000 --> 22:20.875
<i>I forgive her.</i>

22:22.041 --> 22:23.834
<i>You see, I can't survive on my own.</i>

22:24.375 --> 22:25.208
(Steadman) I'm a dork!

22:26.000 --> 22:27.750
I'm a dork. I'm a dork.

22:27.834 --> 22:29.458
(J.D.) <i>Even now,</i>
<i>when I finally get to go home,</i>

22:29.542 --> 22:30.375
<i>in the back of my head,</i>

22:30.458 --> 22:32.458
<i>I'll know the hospital's</i>
<i>still here wide awake.</i>

22:32.542 --> 22:35.500
Bambi! Get out while you still can.

22:35.583 --> 22:37.458
(J.D.) <i>But what the hell?</i>

22:38.375 --> 22:40.792
<i>The most important thing</i>
<i>is I got through my first 3 days</i>

22:40.875 --> 22:42.917
<i>without looking like a complete idiot.</i>

22:43.834 --> 22:44.834
(clunks)

22:44.917 --> 22:45.959
