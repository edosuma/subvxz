00:16.000 --> 00:17.459
what you bring me?

00:22.631 --> 00:24.257
Joseph Baker.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.178
Matthew Hopkins.

00:29.428 --> 00:30.387
Daniel Poole.

00:30.637 --> 00:33.223
- Jacob Pope.
- william Bridges.

00:34.516 --> 00:36.101
Jacob Poole.

00:39.104 --> 00:40.354
Betty.

00:45.276 --> 00:46.484
Ruth.

01:44.285 --> 01:47.122
Make a spell on Joseph Baker, Tituba.

01:47.331 --> 01:49.331
Make him love me.

01:50.123 --> 01:53.001
- Make Daniel Poole my husband.
- Bring me Adam Town.

01:53.167 --> 01:55.128
l want Jacob Poole to love me forever.

01:55.379 --> 01:58.966
- Abby, who do you want?
- She wants John Proctor.

01:59.090 --> 02:02.844
Get her John Proctor again, Tituba.

02:05.804 --> 02:08.014
No, Abby, that be a bad thing.

02:09.681 --> 02:10.890
Abby, no!

02:45.006 --> 02:47.799
lt's the minister!

02:53.929 --> 02:55.723
come away!
He'll see us!

02:55.930 --> 03:00.019
l can't move! Help me!
Help me!

03:00.477 --> 03:04.564
No, no! l can't move!
Help me, please!

03:04.688 --> 03:08.525
l can't move!
Help me! Help!

03:47.810 --> 03:50.271
Dress the child and
come to my study.

03:52.731 --> 03:53.732
Betty.

03:53.982 --> 03:55.024
Betty!

04:02.155 --> 04:03.281
Betty?

04:18.962 --> 04:20.421
Miss williams.

04:38.687 --> 04:41.941
Mrs. Griggs, Reverend Parris asks
that the doctor come at once.

04:42.108 --> 04:45.651
- Betty's gone sick. She can't wake.
- can't she?

04:45.861 --> 04:49.614
The doctor's gone to the Putnam's.
Their Ruth can't wake either.

04:52.574 --> 04:55.412
l fear there be no medicines for this.

04:56.119 --> 04:58.621
l have seen nothing like it before.

04:59.623 --> 05:00.831
There be no fever...

05:01.374 --> 05:03.001
...nor wound...

05:04.294 --> 05:05.836
...and yet she sleeps.

05:06.503 --> 05:08.504
oh, dear Lord.

05:09.089 --> 05:11.300
My Betty is the same.

05:12.175 --> 05:15.052
- The same?
- only, her eyes are closed.

05:15.220 --> 05:18.513
lt's the devil, isn't it?
The devil is taking hold of them.

05:18.680 --> 05:19.932
oh, Goody Putnam- -

05:20.099 --> 05:24.686
Doctor, l beg you. She is my last, my only.
l cannot lose her.

05:24.895 --> 05:27.438
l shall do all l can, Goody Putnam.

05:27.605 --> 05:30.440
But this may be a sickness
beyond my art.

05:31.693 --> 05:32.693
Thomas!

05:32.860 --> 05:36.237
l beg you, we cannot leap to witchcraft
for the cause of this.

05:36.446 --> 05:38.657
Don't you understand it, sir?

05:38.864 --> 05:42.576
There are hurtful, vengeful spirits
laying hands on these children.

05:42.826 --> 05:44.955
Let you take hold here.

05:45.289 --> 05:48.456
Let no one charge you.
Declare it yourself.

05:48.666 --> 05:52.292
Not yet. l need time.
l must think. l must pray.

05:52.710 --> 05:56.088
Yes, l agree with Reverend Parris.

05:56.254 --> 05:57.965
Good day to you, sir.

06:04.595 --> 06:06.764
She still sleeps, then, doctor?

06:06.974 --> 06:09.601
- She flies, you know.
- Flies? come now, man.

06:09.850 --> 06:11.852
- George collins has seen her.
- Seen what?

06:12.060 --> 06:15.856
The minister's daughter
going over lngersoll's barn.

06:18.942 --> 06:23.155
- Uncle, perhaps you should go tell them- -
- what should l tell them?

06:23.363 --> 06:25.280
That my daughter and my niece...

06:25.489 --> 06:29.035
...were discovered dancing like heathen
in the forest?

06:29.243 --> 06:31.036
we did dance...

06:31.286 --> 06:36.416
...and let me be whipped if l must be,
but they are talking of witchcraft.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.418
Betty's not witched!

06:41.878 --> 06:44.715
were you conjuring spirits
in the forest?

06:44.881 --> 06:48.259
- l want the truth now.
- we never conjured spirits.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.012
Now, hear me, child.

06:51.721 --> 06:56.349
You must know that there is a faction in this
church sworn to drive me from my pulpit.

06:56.600 --> 06:57.726
l know.

06:57.851 --> 07:01.562
And they will destroy me now
if my own house...

07:01.812 --> 07:05.733
...turns out to be the center
of some obscene practice.

07:05.982 --> 07:09.444
Now, l saw someone naked
running through the trees.

07:09.652 --> 07:11.862
- No one was- -
- Don't lie to me! l saw it!

07:12.113 --> 07:17.201
- lt were only sport, uncle.
- You call this sport? She cannot wake!

07:23.206 --> 07:26.125
Give me upright answer, now.

07:27.501 --> 07:31.338
Your name in the town is entirely
white, is it not?

07:31.547 --> 07:34.216
There be no blush about my name, sir.

07:35.509 --> 07:38.177
why did Goody Proctor discharge you
from her service?

07:38.386 --> 07:41.764
Because l refused to be her slave.

07:46.393 --> 07:50.273
l have heard said that John Proctor....

07:50.690 --> 07:52.064
John Proctor and you- -

07:52.357 --> 07:57.152
My name is good in the village! Elizabeth
Proctor's an envious, gossiping liar!

07:57.277 --> 08:01.572
Mr. Parris, they're asking for you.
You must come down, sir.

08:09.662 --> 08:12.208
Betty, my sweet, wake up.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.209
wake up, Betty.

08:16.002 --> 08:19.171
Betty! Now, stop this!

08:19.631 --> 08:23.592
l know you hear me. wake up now!

08:23.759 --> 08:25.219
Betty!

08:46.405 --> 08:47.654
John!

08:47.906 --> 08:50.449
Giles and Martha are here.

08:50.741 --> 08:51.908
All right.

08:54.494 --> 08:55.620
Boys.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.588
You've got to come with me
to the village, John.

09:07.756 --> 09:11.634
Mr. Parris, God help us, has summoned
a meeting of the society.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.843
what for?

09:13.051 --> 09:17.180
what for? why has that man ever called
a meeting except for his own benefit?

09:17.346 --> 09:20.724
- l'm explaining it.
- Sorry not to have noticed.

09:20.892 --> 09:23.729
They're saying his daughter, Betty,
has been witched.

09:24.021 --> 09:28.523
She sleeps and can't be waked.
And the Putnam girl too, they say.

09:28.732 --> 09:31.443
- what do you know of this, Mary warren?
- Nothing.

09:31.653 --> 09:33.653
l smell mischief here.

09:33.904 --> 09:37.073
You must come with me, John.
They will look to your judgment.

09:37.282 --> 09:39.742
- How can they not wake up?
- God knows.

09:39.910 --> 09:41.827
You go right ahead, l'll be along.

09:42.035 --> 09:44.663
- l'll see you soon, Elizabeth.
- Goodbye, Martha.

09:59.635 --> 10:02.637
There are still flowers in the field.

10:02.845 --> 10:05.139
You might cut some.

10:07.599 --> 10:11.895
- lt's winter in here yet.
- Aye, l'll cut some flowers.

10:42.214 --> 10:45.132
Give a penny. Give a penny.
Annoy the devil.

10:45.299 --> 10:49.009
Goody osborne, you have
no permission to beg here.

10:52.971 --> 10:57.185
- l'll wait for you. l fear this.
- Fear it? why?

11:18.453 --> 11:20.914
Let us quiet our hearts.

11:23.374 --> 11:25.668
You are all aware of the rumors...

11:26.293 --> 11:31.297
...of that spirit come among us
out of hell.

11:31.589 --> 11:35.718
That hateful enemy of God
and all christian people, the devil.

11:36.260 --> 11:41.015
l have invited the Reverend John Hale
of Beverly to come to Salem.

11:41.266 --> 11:44.058
He has delved deeply...

11:44.267 --> 11:49.064
...into all demonic arts and will
surely go to the bottom of this.

11:49.855 --> 11:53.650
You may recall in Beverly last year
they believed they had a witch...

11:53.858 --> 11:56.402
...until Mr. Hale examined her...

11:56.653 --> 11:59.989
...and decided she was
innocent to witchcraft.

12:02.784 --> 12:07.162
But it may well be that in Salem
he will find signs of Lucifer...

12:07.329 --> 12:09.832
...and if so, you may be sure...

12:10.040 --> 12:12.333
...he will hunt him down.

12:13.835 --> 12:15.753
Let us turn our hearts...

12:16.420 --> 12:19.673
...to Psalm 73...

12:19.882 --> 12:22.926
...''Sure God ls Good To lsrael.''

12:27.888 --> 12:33.351
Sure God is good to Israel

12:49.199 --> 12:52.202
You will stop this now! Betty!

12:52.411 --> 12:56.205
- what'll we do? They're talking witchcraft!
- She means to tell.

12:56.414 --> 12:59.416
we've got to tell
or they'll be calling us witches.

12:59.667 --> 13:04.504
witchery's a hanging error.
Like they done in Boston two year ago.

13:04.713 --> 13:09.259
You'll only be whipped for trying
to conjure the boys and the dancing.

13:14.180 --> 13:18.183
Now, listen to me, Betty, dear.

13:18.392 --> 13:22.937
l've talked to your papa
and l've told him everything.

13:23.145 --> 13:25.855
So there's nothing to
be feared anymore.

13:28.650 --> 13:30.944
l want my mama.

13:31.194 --> 13:34.655
Your mama's dead and buried!

13:35.490 --> 13:37.073
l'll fly to her!

13:37.283 --> 13:39.076
- Let me fly!
- Stop it!

13:39.284 --> 13:42.913
- Betty, come here!
- Mama! Mama! No! Mama!

13:43.079 --> 13:46.583
why are you doing this?
l've told him. He knows now.

13:46.791 --> 13:50.670
You drank blood, Abby!
You didn't tell him that!

13:50.795 --> 13:53.338
You never say that again!

13:53.546 --> 13:56.215
You drank a charm
to kill John Proctor's wife!

13:56.424 --> 14:00.553
- No, Abby.
- You drank a charm to kill Goody Proctor!

14:02.263 --> 14:03.222
Now, shut it!

14:03.472 --> 14:05.806
- She's going to die!
- Now, look, you!

14:06.642 --> 14:08.060
All of you.

14:09.519 --> 14:13.106
we danced. That is all.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.108
And mark this...

14:16.317 --> 14:18.068
...let anyone breathe a word...

14:18.235 --> 14:21.905
...or the edge of a word
about the other things...

14:22.113 --> 14:24.116
...and l will come to you...

14:24.324 --> 14:28.328
...in the black of the night and
l'll bring a pointy reckoning...

14:28.536 --> 14:30.537
...that will shutter you.

14:31.789 --> 14:33.916
And you know l can do it.

14:36.085 --> 14:39.502
l saw lndians smash my parents' head
on the pillow next to mine...

14:39.670 --> 14:43.089
...and l have seen some
reddish work done at night.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.176
And l can make you wish you
never saw the sun go down.

14:47.426 --> 14:49.555
- Mama!
- No, Betty!

15:14.784 --> 15:18.163
- Mama! Mama!
- Keep still, you little devil!

15:18.372 --> 15:20.581
- Betty!
- The devil is here!

15:20.789 --> 15:24.001
when she heard the psalm,
she ran straight for the window.

15:24.543 --> 15:27.963
Mark it for a sign, Mr. Parris.
My mother told me that.

15:28.171 --> 15:33.175
There is hard sickness here,
Giles corey, so please to keep the quiet.

15:33.384 --> 15:37.345
l've not said a word.
Nobody can testify l've said a word.

15:37.554 --> 15:38.848
Rebecca, l fear we're lost.

15:39.181 --> 15:41.599
She cannot bear
to hear the Lord's name!

15:41.724 --> 15:45.101
That's a notorious sign of
witchcraft afoot, Rebecca.

16:04.786 --> 16:07.121
what have you done?

16:08.624 --> 16:13.127
Goody Nurse, will you go to our
Ruth and see if you can wake her?

16:13.252 --> 16:16.672
l think she'll wake
when she tires of it.

16:17.173 --> 16:19.507
l am 26 times a grandma.

16:20.174 --> 16:23.678
They can run you bowlegged
in their silly seasons.

16:26.014 --> 16:29.058
So you've sent for
Reverend Hale of Beverly?

16:29.309 --> 16:33.395
only to satisfy all that
the devil's not among us.

16:34.270 --> 16:38.399
- Mr. Proctor.
- John, come help us.

16:38.566 --> 16:40.525
we are all at sea.

16:40.775 --> 16:43.361
why not meet before
you decided to look for devils?

16:43.654 --> 16:47.657
A man cannot pick his teeth without
some sort of meeting in this society.

16:47.991 --> 16:50.786
Society will not be a bag
to swing around your head.

16:51.119 --> 16:55.539
Mr. Proctor, you must know by now that
the better half of Salem village- -

16:56.330 --> 16:57.707
Dear friends.

16:58.876 --> 17:03.629
Mr. Parris, l think you'd best send
Reverend Hale back as soon as he come.

17:03.879 --> 17:06.758
This will set us all to arguing again
in the society.

17:07.008 --> 17:11.261
Let us rather blame
ourselves than the devil.

17:11.761 --> 17:14.054
Blame ourselves?

17:14.638 --> 17:16.724
How can we blame ourselves?

17:17.016 --> 17:21.020
l'm one of nine sons.
The Putnams have peopled this province.

17:21.270 --> 17:23.771
And we have but one child left of eight.

17:24.021 --> 17:27.526
Goody Ann, we can only go
to God for the cause of that.

17:27.608 --> 17:30.737
God?! You think it be God's work...

17:30.986 --> 17:35.157
...that you have never lost a child
or grandchild and l bury all but one?

17:35.365 --> 17:40.078
who or what lets us decide what is God's
work, Goody Putnam, and what is not?

17:40.244 --> 17:45.124
God never spoke in my ear. l can't think
of anyone else he done the favor.

17:45.290 --> 17:46.959
Your pardon, Rebecca.

18:26.244 --> 18:29.246
ls this your mischief?

18:30.164 --> 18:33.624
l hear the child goes
flying through the air.

18:33.999 --> 18:36.419
oh, she never flew.

18:37.252 --> 18:42.507
we were dancing in the woods. My uncle
leaped in on us. She took fright, is all.

18:54.726 --> 18:58.646
You'll be clapped in the stocks
before you're 20.

18:59.481 --> 19:03.526
oh, John, give me a soft word.

19:05.610 --> 19:09.739
- No, Abby, that's done with.
- l am waiting for you every night.

19:09.906 --> 19:13.952
You cannot. l never gave you hope
to wait for me.

19:15.118 --> 19:19.164
l have something better
than hope, l think.

19:20.540 --> 19:21.499
child.

19:21.707 --> 19:25.879
- How do you call me child?
- wipe it out of mind, you must.

19:26.921 --> 19:29.131
l'll not be coming for you more.

19:30.717 --> 19:33.427
You're surely sporting with me.

19:35.386 --> 19:37.223
You know me better.

19:37.472 --> 19:41.392
l know how you sweated like a stallion
whenever l'd come near you.

19:41.642 --> 19:45.062
l saw your face when she put me out.
You loved me then...

19:45.228 --> 19:47.773
...and you do now.

19:49.064 --> 19:52.777
Abby, l may think of you softly
from time to time.

19:53.653 --> 19:57.948
But l will cut off my hand
before l reach for you again.

20:00.409 --> 20:02.119
we never touched.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.410
Aye.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.956
But we did.

20:18.423 --> 20:21.259
l marvel how a strong man may let
such a sickly wife- -

20:21.511 --> 20:26.181
- Speak nothing of Elizabeth.
- She is blackening my name in the village!

20:26.347 --> 20:28.142
Telling lies about me!

20:28.308 --> 20:32.103
- She's a cold woman and you bend to her!
- Do you look for whipping?

20:32.270 --> 20:35.857
l look for John Proctor,
who put knowledge in my heart.

20:36.024 --> 20:38.692
l never knew what pretense Salem was.

20:38.900 --> 20:41.694
christian women and
their covenanted men!

20:41.861 --> 20:44.114
And all of them boiling in lust!

20:44.323 --> 20:47.657
And now you bid me go dead
to all you taught me?

20:47.825 --> 20:50.244
l know you, John Proctor!

20:50.452 --> 20:52.036
You loved me.

20:53.038 --> 20:56.248
whatever sin it is, you love me yet!

21:04.340 --> 21:05.550
Dr. Hale.

21:10.344 --> 21:13.096
How can the devil be here?
we love God.

21:13.265 --> 21:17.099
- lt's Mr. Hale, John.
- l know who it is. can l help you?

21:17.309 --> 21:18.811
l thank you.

21:22.522 --> 21:23.689
Heavy books.

21:25.065 --> 21:28.235
well, they must be.
They're weighted with authority.

21:29.861 --> 21:32.321
l'm John Proctor, Mr. Hale.

21:32.530 --> 21:34.491
You have afflicted children?

21:34.991 --> 21:37.451
My children's healthy
as bull calves, sir.

21:37.618 --> 21:40.288
Like all the other children in this village.

21:40.455 --> 21:44.790
where is my wood? My contract provides
l be supplied with all of my firewood.

21:44.958 --> 21:47.502
There are wheels
within wheels here, Mr. Hale.

21:48.837 --> 21:52.756
- l hope you'll not forget that.
- That 6 pound is part of my salary!

21:52.966 --> 21:55.802
Salary's 60 pound....

21:57.844 --> 22:02.850
- l am a graduate of Harvard college.
- l am well- instructed in arithmetic!

22:03.057 --> 22:05.767
l cannot fathom you people!

22:06.768 --> 22:11.440
l can never offer one proposition
but l face a howling riot of argument!

22:11.647 --> 22:14.149
l've wondered if the devil
be in it somewhere.

22:14.358 --> 22:15.693
welcome to Salem.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.779
Mr. Hale!

22:18.070 --> 22:20.071
Good to see you.

22:20.281 --> 22:23.825
well, l see you've come well- prepared.

22:24.033 --> 22:26.118
- This is Thomas Putnam.
- How do you do?

22:26.327 --> 22:29.747
Allow me, sir.
This is my wife, Goody Ann.

22:29.997 --> 22:34.375
will you come to our Ruth? Her soul
seems flown away. will you come to her?

22:34.584 --> 22:36.837
Aye, l'll come directly.

22:37.379 --> 22:40.006
And you must be Rebecca Nurse.

22:40.255 --> 22:41.966
And Mr. Nurse?

22:43.093 --> 22:44.217
You know me?

22:44.426 --> 22:47.762
No, but you look as such
a good soul should.

22:48.054 --> 22:50.849
All of us in Beverly have heard
of your great charities.

22:51.015 --> 22:55.353
There is prodigious danger
in seeking loose spirits.

22:56.145 --> 22:57.897
l fear it.

22:58.565 --> 23:01.316
- Francis.
- Mr. Hale.

23:02.526 --> 23:05.528
l go to God for you, sir.

23:05.736 --> 23:09.073
l hope you do not mean
that we go to Satan here.

23:11.742 --> 23:14.076
l wish l knew.

23:17.289 --> 23:19.915
l hear you be a sensible man,
Mr. Hale.

23:20.083 --> 23:23.169
l hope you'll leave some of it
in Salem.

23:33.053 --> 23:37.348
our child cannot wake, sir.
She lies as though dead.

23:39.558 --> 23:42.060
And this one cannot bear the Lord's name.

23:42.644 --> 23:44.480
lt's a sure sign of witchcraft.

23:44.688 --> 23:48.858
No, no, Mr. Putnam. we must not
look to superstition in this.

23:49.483 --> 23:52.778
The marks of the devil
are as definite as stone.

24:08.833 --> 24:10.377
what book is that?

24:11.252 --> 24:12.670
what's there, sir?

24:13.254 --> 24:16.465
Here is all the invisible world.

24:18.217 --> 24:22.596
ln these books the devil stands
stripped of all his brute disguises.

24:22.888 --> 24:27.642
Here are all your familiar spirits,
your incubi and succubi.

24:27.850 --> 24:31.353
Your witches that go by land,
by air and by sea.

24:32.646 --> 24:34.274
Have no fear now.

24:35.024 --> 24:37.733
we shall find him out
if he's among us.

24:37.984 --> 24:41.905
And l mean to crush him utterly
if he has shown his face.

24:45.990 --> 24:48.159
Here is my niece, Abigail.

24:54.664 --> 24:57.668
l'd like to examine your Ruth
before l say more.

24:59.043 --> 25:02.130
Mr. Hale, l've always wanted
to ask a learned man...

25:02.338 --> 25:05.091
...what signifies the reading
of strange books?

25:05.299 --> 25:09.427
Many a night l've found her in a corner
reading of a book. Not the Bible, either.

25:09.636 --> 25:10.971
- who?
- Martha, my wife.

25:11.179 --> 25:14.099
l'm not saying the devil's
touched her, but mark this:

25:14.307 --> 25:18.394
Last night l tried and tried
but could not say my prayers.

25:18.603 --> 25:21.355
Then she closed her book
and walked out of the house.

25:21.564 --> 25:26.027
And suddenly, mark this,
l could pray again.

25:28.654 --> 25:30.488
The stoppage of prayer.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.783
we'll discuss that.

25:32.949 --> 25:35.450
Mr. Hale, this way.

25:38.245 --> 25:41.081
was there no warning
of this affliction?

25:42.873 --> 25:46.378
Do you recall any disturbance
before it struck?

25:49.212 --> 25:51.507
Any unusual behavior?

25:52.215 --> 25:53.593
Mr. Hale.

26:01.223 --> 26:03.099
Mr. Parris.

26:05.893 --> 26:07.645
l did discover my niece...

26:08.272 --> 26:12.649
...with a number of her friends,
dancing in the forest.

26:14.610 --> 26:18.572
- You permit dancing?
- No, no. lt was secret.

26:18.739 --> 26:22.826
- Mr. Parris' slave has knowledge of conjuring.
- Now, that may not be true.

26:23.035 --> 26:26.120
Abigail, you must tell
me about this dancing.

26:26.328 --> 26:30.457
- common dancing is all it is, sir.
- when you are dancing, is there a fire?

26:30.790 --> 26:32.043
why?

26:33.043 --> 26:35.421
There was a fire.
They were boiling something.

26:35.670 --> 26:37.839
- Lentils and beans!
- was anything moving?

26:38.089 --> 26:42.133
- That jumped in. we never put that in.
- what jumped in?

26:47.305 --> 26:49.390
l must see these other girls.

26:50.307 --> 26:52.310
who are they? l want their names.

26:52.560 --> 26:56.688
Someone called the devil
in that forest.

26:58.064 --> 27:01.943
who was it led you
to dance around the fire?

27:03.027 --> 27:06.990
You can save yourselves
if you tell me who it was.

27:09.408 --> 27:12.743
was there one among you
who drank from the kettle?

27:14.120 --> 27:18.291
was there perhaps a casting of spells?

27:20.750 --> 27:22.669
was there?!

27:24.629 --> 27:27.758
Not l! lt wasn't me, l swear it!

27:28.007 --> 27:30.969
These two children may be dying! who?!

27:32.011 --> 27:34.096
- Tituba.
- l knew it!

27:34.304 --> 27:36.891
- Tituba!
- come out now!

27:37.474 --> 27:39.726
She made me do it!
She made Betty do it!

27:39.892 --> 27:44.272
- Tituba no do bad thing!
- She made me drink blood!

27:44.480 --> 27:47.024
- You drank blood?
- My baby's blood!

27:47.233 --> 27:49.443
who murdered my babies?

27:49.610 --> 27:51.612
l want their names! who are they?!

27:51.820 --> 27:56.491
why can the girls not wake? Did you
send your spirit out to silence them?

27:56.700 --> 27:58.325
l love me Betty.

27:58.951 --> 28:01.787
- Hang that bitch!
- No! Not Tituba!

28:01.995 --> 28:04.331
You've conjured her to be silent,
have you not?

28:04.539 --> 28:08.375
She beg me conjure.
She begged me make charm.

28:08.585 --> 28:09.585
She lies!

28:10.586 --> 28:14.422
She sends her spirit into me in church!
She makes me laugh at prayer!

28:14.632 --> 28:18.384
- She's often laughed at prayer.
- She comes into me when l sleep.

28:18.594 --> 28:22.221
- She makes me dream corruptions!
- why you say bad thing, Abby?

28:22.429 --> 28:25.558
Some nights l wake...

28:25.725 --> 28:27.517
...and l find myself...

28:27.684 --> 28:31.937
...standing naked in the open doorway
without a stitch on my body!

28:32.312 --> 28:34.691
And she makes me do that...

28:34.899 --> 28:38.778
...singing her damn Barbados songs,
tempting me!

28:38.986 --> 28:43.156
Tituba, when did you compact
with the devil? Tell me!

28:43.323 --> 28:46.116
l don't. l don't compact
with the devil.

28:47.285 --> 28:50.580
Tell or l will beat you
to your death!

28:55.293 --> 28:57.377
l tell! l tell him!

28:57.669 --> 28:59.545
l tell him. l tell him.

29:00.254 --> 29:02.549
l don't desire- -

29:03.550 --> 29:06.677
l don't desire to work for him.

29:11.515 --> 29:12.765
Then you saw him.

29:17.061 --> 29:18.979
You poor woman.

29:20.021 --> 29:23.775
He has you by the throat
this very moment, doesn't he?

29:25.484 --> 29:28.529
Tituba, l'm going to break his
grip on both of you.

29:28.737 --> 29:31.823
l'm going to pry open
the hands of Lucifer.

29:32.700 --> 29:37.036
- You would be a good christian once again?
- Aye, sir, a good christian.

29:37.244 --> 29:38.497
You love God?

29:38.705 --> 29:42.041
- l love him with all my being.
- ln God's holy name...

29:42.249 --> 29:44.919
- ...and to his glory...
- To his glory.

29:45.128 --> 29:48.964
...open yourself, receive his cleansing light
within you. You want that?

29:49.172 --> 29:55.344
- l want that light. Save me, Mr. Hale.
- l will, if you open your heart to me.

29:55.635 --> 29:58.555
when the devil comes to you,
does he bring other people?

29:58.763 --> 30:03.017
- Sarah Good? Does he bring Goody Good?
- Are they men or women?

30:03.225 --> 30:07.105
- l couldn't see, it was dark!
- You saw him, why not others?

30:07.271 --> 30:09.900
They was talking
and running around!

30:10.149 --> 30:12.943
- Are they Salem witches?
- l believe so. Yes, sir!

30:13.109 --> 30:15.403
l will protect you.

30:15.695 --> 30:19.365
- The devil can never overcome a minister.
- l know that, sir.

30:19.573 --> 30:24.703
Tituba, God put you in our hands
to help cleanse this village.

30:25.161 --> 30:29.792
You are God's eyes.
Now, face God and speak utterly.

30:29.959 --> 30:33.251
who came to you with the devil?
Two? Three? Four?

30:33.460 --> 30:37.632
- was Sarah Good with him, or osborne?
- Their names, their names!

30:37.839 --> 30:41.885
- How many times he bid me kill you!
- Kill me?

30:42.135 --> 30:45.971
''Rise up, Tituba, and cut that man's throat!''
That's what him tell me.

30:46.306 --> 30:49.641
l said, ''No, devil.
l don't hate that man.''

30:49.850 --> 30:54.645
Him say, ''Tituba, you work for me.
l make you free.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.650
l give you pretty dress to wear...

30:57.858 --> 31:00.443
...and l put you way up
high in the air...

31:00.776 --> 31:04.488
...and you going flying back
home to Barbados.''

31:05.656 --> 31:08.325
And l say, ''No, devil, you lie!''

31:10.701 --> 31:11.870
And then...

31:12.537 --> 31:13.997
...him come to me...

31:14.871 --> 31:20.086
...one stormy night and him say,
''Tituba, look!

31:20.503 --> 31:25.214
l has white people belong to me.''

31:25.339 --> 31:27.342
And l look.

31:28.343 --> 31:30.094
l look.

31:31.218 --> 31:33.473
And there was Sarah Good!

31:33.722 --> 31:36.432
l knew it! Bless you, Tituba!

31:36.641 --> 31:39.977
- Aye! And Goody osborne!
- l knew it!

31:40.895 --> 31:45.232
They were midwives to me three times
and my babies shriveled in their hands!

31:45.482 --> 31:47.858
l want to open myself!

31:48.110 --> 31:49.862
l want the light of God!

31:50.278 --> 31:53.155
l want the sweet love of Jesus!

31:53.531 --> 31:55.658
l did dance for the devil!

31:55.867 --> 31:59.245
l saw him! l wrote in his book!

31:59.745 --> 32:04.081
l go back to Jesus! l kiss his hand!

32:04.582 --> 32:08.418
l saw Sarah Good with the devil!
l saw Goody osborne with the devil!

32:08.710 --> 32:10.838
l saw Bridget Bishop with the devil!

32:11.004 --> 32:14.382
- l saw Goody Howe with the devil!
- She speaks!

32:14.591 --> 32:16.133
l saw Goody Good!

32:16.300 --> 32:17.594
l saw Goody osborne!

32:17.969 --> 32:19.763
l saw Goody Barrow with the devil!

32:35.609 --> 32:36.651
Hallelujah!

32:39.989 --> 32:43.741
Glory be to God!
lt is broken, they are free!

32:44.242 --> 32:47.244
where's the marshal?
Arrest Sarah osborne!

32:50.873 --> 32:52.581
Sarah Good in a jail.

32:52.748 --> 32:57.003
would you believe a court would ever
bother to jail that silly old turtle?

32:57.128 --> 33:03.466
John! Giles! News from the village.
There were six more accused today.

33:04.341 --> 33:08.848
- More mischief here, Giles.
- The town's gone wild, l think.

33:09.140 --> 33:13.350
They've sent to Boston for the deputy
governor to come and take charge.

33:13.559 --> 33:18.229
That's Danforth. He'll bring
some sense to it. That's good news.

33:18.396 --> 33:22.358
Judge Hathorne condemned 1 4 more
to the jail last night.

33:22.567 --> 33:25.444
And promised hanging
if they don't confess.

33:25.611 --> 33:29.155
- confess? To what?
- Bewitching the children.

33:29.532 --> 33:33.076
Abigail williams suffers
most of all, he says.

33:34.744 --> 33:36.286
Save my cider.

33:36.454 --> 33:39.499
l'll go home now and tell Martha.

34:05.938 --> 34:08.899
l'm thinking if the crop comes good...

34:09.065 --> 34:11.360
...l'll buy Joseph ward's heifer.

34:12.444 --> 34:15.321
- How would that please you?
- Aye, it would.

34:18.614 --> 34:21.284
l mean to please you, Elizabeth.

34:37.049 --> 34:40.510
lt would be well if you went to Salem.

34:42.138 --> 34:47.639
Abigail told you it had naught to do
with witchcraft, did she not?

34:48.934 --> 34:53.312
They say Ezekiel cheever's clerk
of the court now. can you not tell him?

34:55.522 --> 34:58.568
God forbid you keep that
from the court, John.

35:00.861 --> 35:04.072
- A wonder they do believe her.
- But they do.

35:07.783 --> 35:09.869
Mary warren...

35:10.036 --> 35:14.248
...says that where Abigail walks
the crowds part like the sea for lsrael.

35:21.212 --> 35:23.589
l think you must go at once.

35:25.341 --> 35:27.467
l would go tonight, John.

35:27.718 --> 35:30.594
- will you?
- l will think on it.

35:31.179 --> 35:34.182
- You cannot keep it.
- l say l will think on it.

35:49.237 --> 35:51.740
How will l prove
what she told me, Elizabeth?

35:51.906 --> 35:55.491
we were alone together.
l've no proof of what she said.

35:59.829 --> 36:02.373
You were alone with her?

36:03.039 --> 36:05.292
For a moment, alone, aye.

36:05.918 --> 36:08.504
Then it is not as you told me.

36:10.005 --> 36:11.923
A moment. There were others close by.

36:12.172 --> 36:16.469
- Do as you wish, then.
- l'll not have your suspicion anymore.

36:17.720 --> 36:22.265
No, John, if it were not Abigail that you
must go to hurt, would you falter now?

36:22.975 --> 36:27.019
- l think not.
- You'll not judge me more. l forgot Abigail.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.856
- And l.
- Spare me. You forget and forgive nothing.

36:31.023 --> 36:35.902
ln this seven months since she has gone,
l've not moved without l think to please you.

36:36.277 --> 36:38.905
But a funeral still marches
around your heart.

36:39.113 --> 36:42.325
You're not open with me.
You saw her with a crowd, you said- -

36:42.658 --> 36:44.367
l'll plead my honesty no more.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.328
No more!

36:46.704 --> 36:50.039
l should've roared you down
when first you told me your suspicion...

36:50.164 --> 36:54.334
...but like a christian, l confessed.
But you're not God, Elizabeth!

36:57.962 --> 37:01.592
Let you look for some goodness in me.

37:03.593 --> 37:05.969
And judge me not.

37:09.055 --> 37:12.725
The magistrate sits in your heart
that judges you.

37:13.435 --> 37:17.939
l never thought you but a good man, John.
only somewhat bewildered.

37:20.107 --> 37:25.153
oh, Elizabeth.
Your justice would freeze beer.

38:01.810 --> 38:04.396
- Judge Hathorne.
- Judge Danforth.

38:04.604 --> 38:06.440
- Judge Sewall.
- Sir.

38:06.607 --> 38:08.482
- Mr. Parris.
- Your Honor.

38:08.691 --> 38:10.443
- Mr. Hale.
- Judge.

38:13.112 --> 38:14.822
The selectmen.

38:19.119 --> 38:20.660
Thomas Putnam.

38:28.918 --> 38:31.087
The afflicted girls, sir.

38:32.838 --> 38:35.090
l assure you, gentlemen...

38:35.257 --> 38:38.718
...that His Majesty's Government
is now determined...

38:38.842 --> 38:45.015
...that the devil shall not rule over
one single inch of Massachusetts!

38:46.099 --> 38:49.519
And if indeed he has come...

38:49.768 --> 38:55.065
...here in Salem is where
we shall dig him out.

38:56.317 --> 38:59.152
Provided every precaution be taken...

38:59.402 --> 39:04.198
...to guard against the testimony
of distracted persons...

39:04.365 --> 39:06.992
...and, of course, the mad.

39:10.537 --> 39:12.287
lndeed, Judge Sewall.

39:12.914 --> 39:15.415
Bring in Sarah Osborne!

39:21.130 --> 39:24.007
Now, Sarah osborne,
here is Sarah Good...

39:24.256 --> 39:27.801
...who has confessed to witchcraft
and will not hang.

39:28.010 --> 39:30.638
l bid you follow her example.

39:30.763 --> 39:35.308
She testifies that when the devil
came to her, you were in his company.

39:35.476 --> 39:38.937
There they stood, big as life.
Him and her.

39:39.063 --> 39:44.942
And osborne writing her name in his
book with her own red blood!

39:46.528 --> 39:50.489
Your Honors, l never
see the devil in my life.

39:51.281 --> 39:54.325
But l can dance as fast backwards...

39:54.576 --> 39:56.161
...as he can forward!

39:56.327 --> 39:57.702
Sit down, l tell you!

39:57.952 --> 40:00.832
- Sit her down!
- Let go of me!

40:00.998 --> 40:04.835
You must stop your funning.
You must give up your stories!

40:05.084 --> 40:08.214
You bring me to harm!
Do you hear me? You bring me to harm!

40:08.463 --> 40:10.797
Stop hurting me, Goody osborne!

40:11.048 --> 40:13.258
Help me, Judge Danforth!

40:17.262 --> 40:21.098
- what are you doing to these girls?
- what do you mumble to make them so sick?

40:21.766 --> 40:26.019
l was only saying my commandments.
l hope l may say my commandments!

40:26.311 --> 40:28.063
Let her recite her commandments.

40:28.397 --> 40:32.484
Your Grace, l may only
say my commandments outdoor.

40:32.693 --> 40:36.904
There are 1 0 commandments.
Do you know any?

40:37.071 --> 40:38.530
Help me!

40:38.989 --> 40:41.241
You have lied to the court.

40:41.408 --> 40:45.161
l say, you have lied to the court.
Have you not?

40:45.495 --> 40:48.956
l'm innocent to witch.
The devil knows that!

40:53.044 --> 40:55.420
''Then Nebuchadnezzar the king
was astonished...

40:55.628 --> 40:59.465
...and rose up in haste
and spake and...

41:00.550 --> 41:02.968
...said unto his counselors:

41:03.301 --> 41:06.555
'Did not we cast three men bound
into the midst of the fire?'''

41:06.764 --> 41:08.973
She's been to the court.

41:09.224 --> 41:11.558
Get out of my garden, you filthy beast!

41:11.809 --> 41:13.018
whose goat is this?

41:13.227 --> 41:16.271
Take your hands off my goat!
And curb your wicked tongue!

41:16.522 --> 41:18.440
Take your goat and get out!

41:18.773 --> 41:21.484
The devil take you all!
All of you be damned!

41:21.902 --> 41:25.446
You are arrested
on suspicion of witchcraft.

41:25.738 --> 41:28.741
Any compact you have made
with the devil....

41:41.962 --> 41:43.714
This man is full of spite!

41:44.088 --> 41:47.006
l am no witch!
His goats were eating my food!

41:47.633 --> 41:49.551
These girls are mad!

42:07.775 --> 42:09.651
l warned you once before, Proctor.

42:09.776 --> 42:11.987
That's my lumber. You're in my bounds!

42:12.278 --> 42:15.656
My land's always run up
through the forest and l haven't sold any.

42:15.948 --> 42:18.784
lt is clear in my grandfather's will.

42:18.993 --> 42:22.954
Your grandfather damn near
willed away my north pasture!

42:23.162 --> 42:26.583
But he knew l'd bite his arm
if he tried it.

42:31.587 --> 42:35.258
Good morning!
Morning, Mr. Putnam.

42:40.387 --> 42:41.680
order!

42:41.847 --> 42:46.518
Now, Ruth Putnam, when did you
last see Mr. Jacobs?

42:46.685 --> 42:49.770
He come to me two night past
when l was abed.

42:49.978 --> 42:53.565
But, Ruth, you are mistaken.

42:54.232 --> 42:59.737
You know me.
l am Mr. Jacobs, your neighbor.

43:00.695 --> 43:04.866
l have 600 acres next to theirs.

43:05.033 --> 43:07.453
She has known me all her life.

43:08.037 --> 43:11.873
He come through my window.
Then he lay down upon me.

43:13.124 --> 43:15.251
l could not take breath.

43:15.502 --> 43:18.086
His body crush heavy upon me.

43:18.253 --> 43:19.921
And he say in my ear:

43:20.839 --> 43:25.760
''Ruth Putnam, l will have your life
if you testify against me in court.''

43:25.968 --> 43:28.804
what say you to this charge, Mr. Jacobs?

43:29.013 --> 43:31.556
But, Your Honor...

43:31.807 --> 43:35.643
...l must have these sticks to walk with.

43:35.809 --> 43:38.772
How may l come through a window?

43:38.979 --> 43:42.607
But you could have sent out your spirit
through a window, could you not?

43:42.858 --> 43:46.319
But how may my spirit go out of my body?

43:46.485 --> 43:48.989
There's a black man whispering
at his shoulder.

43:49.530 --> 43:51.240
Ruth Putnam has informed me...

43:51.408 --> 43:57.121
...that there is a black man whispering
in your ear at this very instant.

44:01.165 --> 44:04.751
He's there!
He's whispering, l see him!

44:04.960 --> 44:07.421
- l see him. l see him.
- Do you see him?

44:07.755 --> 44:09.214
A black man!

44:09.422 --> 44:11.341
The devil is here!

44:20.307 --> 44:25.269
- How dare you mock them, Martha corey?
- what else are fools good for?

44:50.501 --> 44:54.211
How do you dare go to Salem again,
when l forbade you?

44:56.965 --> 44:58.883
No! Don't hurt me!

44:59.091 --> 45:02.176
l am sick, pray, hurt me not!

45:02.385 --> 45:04.555
Get in the house! Go on!

45:08.767 --> 45:12.228
l made a gift for you today,
Goody Proctor.

45:12.395 --> 45:14.522
Thank you. lt is a fair poppet.

45:14.730 --> 45:17.815
we must all love each other now.

45:19.025 --> 45:20.402
Go on in.

45:25.364 --> 45:27.324
what ails you, child?

45:27.533 --> 45:30.578
oh, Mr. Jacobs will hang!

45:31.702 --> 45:33.872
- Hang?
- Aye.

45:34.581 --> 45:37.290
And Goody osborne too.

45:37.542 --> 45:41.128
- The deputy governor will permit it?
- He must.

45:42.296 --> 45:44.380
But not Sarah Good.

45:44.631 --> 45:49.551
She will only sit in jail some time,
for Sarah Good confessed, you see.

45:52.637 --> 45:56.684
l am amazed you do not see
the weighty work we do.

45:56.891 --> 46:00.270
The devil is loose in Salem, Mr. Proctor.

46:02.022 --> 46:04.857
we must discover where he's hiding.

46:06.191 --> 46:10.070
So l'll be gone every day for some time.

46:10.279 --> 46:14.781
- l am an official of the court now.
- l'll thrash the devil out of you!

46:16.326 --> 46:18.202
l saved her life tonight!

46:19.119 --> 46:20.829
l am accused?

46:24.250 --> 46:27.000
You were somewhat mentioned.

46:27.251 --> 46:29.128
But l told the court...

46:29.336 --> 46:34.133
...l never seen no sign you ever
sent your spirit out to hurt no one...

46:34.341 --> 46:36.551
- ...and they dismissed it.
- who accused me?

46:37.761 --> 46:40.972
l am bound by law. l cannot tell.

46:46.061 --> 46:47.894
Go to bed, Mary.

46:50.271 --> 46:53.191
l'll not be ordered
to bed no more, Mr. Proctor.

46:53.399 --> 46:56.944
l am 1 8 and a woman,
however single.

46:57.153 --> 47:00.613
Do you wish to sit up?
Then sit up.

47:01.949 --> 47:03.991
l wish to go to bed.

47:04.242 --> 47:05.785
Good night, then.

47:05.994 --> 47:07.203
Good night.

47:30.682 --> 47:32.642
The noose is up.

47:35.687 --> 47:37.688
There'll be no noose.

47:42.316 --> 47:46.529
Abigail wants me dead, John.
You know it.

47:52.243 --> 47:54.077
Thank you, my dear.

48:02.876 --> 48:04.712
God bless you, child.

48:37.449 --> 48:41.410
l come to tell you to think
on what to do to save yourself.

48:43.287 --> 48:45.789
You'll say you cannot see spirits anymore.

48:46.122 --> 48:48.708
And you will never cry witchery again.

48:55.756 --> 48:59.343
l know you must speak so, John.
l understand.

49:00.928 --> 49:03.930
But my spirit's changed entirely.

49:05.264 --> 49:06.933
l suffer now.

49:10.185 --> 49:12.479
lt's the truth, John! Look!

49:13.355 --> 49:16.148
The bite your wife gave me
is not yet healed.

49:17.484 --> 49:19.236
- My wife?
- Saturday...

49:19.402 --> 49:21.945
...she come to my bed in the night
and bite my breast.

49:22.154 --> 49:24.323
My wife has not left the house this month.

49:24.489 --> 49:27.867
why must she leave the house
to send her spirit on me?

49:28.076 --> 49:31.996
Don't George Jacobs come jabbing at me
with his walking sticks?

49:32.163 --> 49:34.915
Feel the lumps he give me only last night.

49:41.963 --> 49:44.131
George Jacobs is locked up in the jail.

49:44.340 --> 49:46.008
And thank God he is!

49:46.217 --> 49:47.634
They'll hang him.

49:47.802 --> 49:50.804
- And he prays! He prays in jail!
- May he not pray?

49:51.054 --> 49:53.765
And torture me at night
while he's praying! Hypocrite!

49:53.932 --> 49:57.435
They all are. Thank God l have the power
to cleanse the town of them!

49:57.685 --> 49:58.853
Hear me.

50:00.688 --> 50:05.525
lf ever you cry witch against my wife,
it will be the end of you.

50:05.733 --> 50:07.985
l will not have her condemned.

50:08.235 --> 50:10.822
l am but God's finger, John.

50:11.572 --> 50:15.118
lf he would condemn Elizabeth,
she will be condemned.

50:15.368 --> 50:16.702
You know me.

50:16.910 --> 50:20.872
lf she is condemned,
it will be the end of you.

50:46.561 --> 50:51.065
Samuel, l believe you are sometimes
not entirely content with us.

50:51.233 --> 50:53.150
Am l correct?

50:56.112 --> 50:58.363
l must tell you, Thomas.

50:58.696 --> 51:04.035
l had not expected so much of our evidence
to come from children.

51:04.285 --> 51:06.454
- Had you?
- l had not.

51:06.704 --> 51:10.374
But you cannot doubt
the children are painfully attacked.

51:10.582 --> 51:12.959
No, l see that plainly.

51:13.168 --> 51:15.627
Recall the Gospel, Samuel:

51:15.836 --> 51:19.547
''From the mouths of babes shall
come the truth.''

51:20.758 --> 51:22.801
But it is also this Putnam woman.

51:23.009 --> 51:26.262
l wonder if losing her children
has not distracted her mind.

51:26.429 --> 51:31.516
And Mr. Putnam is in constant disputation
with his neighbors over his boundaries.

51:31.725 --> 51:33.811
Some tell me he's not honest.

51:34.019 --> 51:35.604
Dear friend...

51:36.271 --> 51:40.107
...no court can wait for saints
to provide evidence.

51:40.316 --> 51:43.068
l shall be scrupulously just.

51:43.319 --> 51:45.905
Surely you will rest on that.

51:47.948 --> 51:50.743
l never doubted that, Thomas.

52:08.632 --> 52:11.218
- Mr. Hale.
- Proctor.

52:11.343 --> 52:13.178
Good evening to you, sir.

52:16.181 --> 52:19.935
- You are Goodwife Proctor?
- Aye, sir, Elizabeth.

52:21.185 --> 52:24.187
Are you aware your wife's name
is mentioned in the court?

52:24.396 --> 52:27.692
our Mary warren told us.
we're entirely amazed.

52:29.025 --> 52:30.568
l am a stranger here.

52:30.817 --> 52:34.363
l find it hard to draw a clear opinion
of them that are accused.

52:35.197 --> 52:39.702
So l go tonight from house to house.
l come now from Rebecca Nurse's house.

52:39.910 --> 52:41.578
Rebecca is charged?

52:41.787 --> 52:46.791
God forbid that such a one be charged.
But she is mentioned somewhat.

52:46.958 --> 52:48.501
Mr. Hale...

52:49.711 --> 52:53.088
...l hope you'll never believe
that Rebecca trafficked with the devil.

52:53.505 --> 52:56.675
Goody Proctor, this is a strange time.

52:57.301 --> 53:02.055
None can any longer doubt the powers
of darkness are attacking this village.

53:02.221 --> 53:04.556
we have no knowledge
in that line, Mr. Hale.

53:04.806 --> 53:09.354
l thought, sir, to put some questions as
to the christian character of this house...

53:09.604 --> 53:11.522
...if you'll permit me.

53:14.190 --> 53:17.193
we have no fear of questions, sir.
come in.

53:20.028 --> 53:22.696
In the book of record Mr. Parris keeps...

53:22.906 --> 53:27.952
...l note that you are come to Sabbath
meeting but 26 time in 1 7 month.

53:29.744 --> 53:31.705
Sit down, Mr. Hale.

53:33.123 --> 53:34.749
l'll be straight with you.

53:34.958 --> 53:39.421
No minister before Parris ever demanded
the deed to the house we lend him.

53:39.588 --> 53:42.756
The meetinghouse had pewter candlesticks
upon the pulpit.

53:42.966 --> 53:46.801
when Mr. Paris came, he preached nothing
but golden ones until he had them.

53:46.970 --> 53:52.390
when l look to heaven and see my money
glaring at his elbows, it hurt my prayer, sir.

53:53.100 --> 53:55.142
lt hurt my prayer.

53:56.894 --> 54:00.314
And your children.
How comes it the last is not baptized?

54:00.899 --> 54:05.526
Mr. Parris won't lay his hand upon my baby.
l see no light of God in that man.

54:05.651 --> 54:08.821
But the man's ordained.
Therefore, the light of God is in him.

54:08.988 --> 54:12.282
what is your suspicion?
l hung the door of the church!

54:12.407 --> 54:16.369
- That's a good sign.
- Maybe we are too hard on Parris.

54:16.829 --> 54:19.704
But sure we never
loved the devil here.

54:21.499 --> 54:23.542
Do you know your
commandments, Elizabeth?

54:24.292 --> 54:26.335
l surely do.

54:26.712 --> 54:31.716
l'm covenanted, sir. There be no mark
upon my christian life.

54:32.132 --> 54:33.842
And you, mister?

54:34.050 --> 54:36.011
Aye, l'm sure l do.

54:36.637 --> 54:38.304
Let you repeat them.

54:39.389 --> 54:41.891
- My commandments?
- Aye.

54:46.562 --> 54:49.480
Thou shalt not kill.
Thou shalt not steal.

54:49.605 --> 54:53.026
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods
nor make graven images.

54:53.192 --> 54:55.403
Shalt not take the name
of the Lord in vain.

54:55.612 --> 54:58.197
Thou shalt have no other gods
before me.

54:58.323 --> 55:00.199
Thou shalt keep the Sabbath day holy.

55:00.407 --> 55:04.787
Thou shalt honor thy father and mother.
Thou shalt not bear false witness.

55:08.707 --> 55:10.500
- No graven- -
- You said that twice.

55:10.708 --> 55:12.293
l know.

55:15.796 --> 55:18.088
- Adultery, John.
- Aye.

55:19.591 --> 55:23.887
You see, between the two of us, we do
know them all. l think it be a small fault.

55:26.013 --> 55:27.973
Theology, sir...

55:28.182 --> 55:30.182
...is a fortress.

55:30.559 --> 55:34.479
No crack in a fortress
may be accounted small.

55:39.691 --> 55:42.069
l bid you both good night, then.

55:52.537 --> 55:54.163
Mr. Hale?

56:06.091 --> 56:07.882
Mr. Hale.

56:09.594 --> 56:13.930
l know the children's sickness had naught
to do with witchcraft.

56:14.097 --> 56:15.139
what?

56:15.348 --> 56:18.060
Parris discovered them sporting
in the woods.

56:18.226 --> 56:20.936
- They were startled and took sick.
- who told you this?

56:21.144 --> 56:22.479
Abigail williams.

56:23.897 --> 56:26.900
Abigail told you it had naught
to do with witchcraft?

56:27.108 --> 56:30.153
- She told me the night you came.
- why did you keep this?

56:30.361 --> 56:33.614
l never knew till tonight
the world has gone mad with nonsense.

56:33.822 --> 56:37.658
l have myself examined Tituba,
Sarah Good and 26 others...

56:37.867 --> 56:40.495
...who have confessed
to dealing with the devil.

56:40.704 --> 56:44.290
why not, when they must hang
for denying it? You ever thought of that?

56:45.624 --> 56:50.003
l have a rumor you do not believe
there are witches in the world. ls that true?

56:53.090 --> 56:55.175
The Bible speaks of witches, so- -

56:55.341 --> 56:59.093
Sir, l am a good woman. l know it.

56:59.553 --> 57:03.766
lf you believe that l may only do good
work and yet be secretly bound to Satan...

57:05.600 --> 57:08.645
...then l must tell you
l do not believe it.

57:08.854 --> 57:09.938
You bewilder him.

57:10.104 --> 57:13.774
- But you do believe there are witches?
- lf l am thought one, then no.

57:13.982 --> 57:16.402
You surely do not fly
against the Gospels?

57:16.610 --> 57:19.904
Question Abigail williams
about the Gospels, not myself!

57:22.407 --> 57:24.700
They've taken Martha and Rebecca!

57:25.827 --> 57:27.327
on what charge?

57:27.535 --> 57:30.205
The supernatural murder
of Putnam's babies!

57:30.414 --> 57:33.374
Rebecca murdered children?
Are you still believing this?

57:33.542 --> 57:38.546
Remember, until an hour before the devil
fell, God thought him beautiful in heaven!

57:46.428 --> 57:48.928
l never harmed no one!

57:50.389 --> 57:52.808
l never harmed no one!

57:54.059 --> 57:56.061
My dear Rebecca!

57:56.311 --> 57:57.687
we'll soon have you free!

57:57.939 --> 58:01.315
Pity cheever, not us!
He's the one going to hell!

58:04.234 --> 58:06.695
Good evening to you, Proctor. All.

58:07.154 --> 58:08.738
cheever.

58:08.946 --> 58:13.326
- l've a warrant for your wife.
- l know nothing of this. who charged her?

58:13.493 --> 58:14.661
Abigail williams.

58:14.869 --> 58:17.078
For what crime? on what proof?

58:18.580 --> 58:21.542
l like not to search a man's house.

58:21.750 --> 58:24.002
But, by law, l must enter.

58:34.803 --> 58:37.514
will you hand me any poppets
your wife may keep here?

58:37.680 --> 58:40.683
l have kept no poppet since l were a girl.

58:44.728 --> 58:46.604
This is Mary's.

58:47.397 --> 58:49.608
Mary, come down here.

58:50.150 --> 58:51.692
Mary!

58:58.282 --> 59:01.660
l had my doubts, Proctor.
But this is calamity!

59:01.868 --> 59:03.495
You see it, sir? lt is a needle.

59:03.704 --> 59:05.039
what signifies a needle?

59:05.497 --> 59:08.789
The williams girl, Abigail,
today she fall to the floor...

59:08.999 --> 59:11.127
...with a needle stuck in her belly!

59:11.336 --> 59:14.004
She testified your wife's spirit
pushed it in!

59:14.128 --> 59:17.339
- Tell how this poppet came to be here.
- what poppet is that, sir?

59:18.091 --> 59:20.259
This poppet! This poppet!

59:20.425 --> 59:22.928
l made that in court
and give it to her yesterday.

59:23.137 --> 59:25.639
A needle's been discovered
inside that poppet.

59:25.807 --> 59:28.265
- l meant no harm by it.
- You stuck it in yourself?

59:28.474 --> 59:31.269
For safekeeping.
l must have forgot to take it out.

59:31.477 --> 59:36.189
You are certain this be your natural memory?
No one's conjuring you to say this?

59:36.398 --> 59:39.819
No, sir, l am entirely myself.
Ask Abby.

59:40.068 --> 59:41.861
Abby sat beside me when l made it.

59:42.028 --> 59:44.905
That girl is murder.
She must be ripped out of the world!

59:45.114 --> 59:48.450
- You heard that, Herrick? ''Ripped out.''
- out of my house!

59:48.660 --> 59:50.410
And you with him!

59:50.995 --> 59:54.664
- You are a broken minister.
- l promise you, if she is innocent- -

59:54.873 --> 59:56.958
lf she is innocent?

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.170
why is it never wondered if Parris
be innocent? or Putnam or Abigail?

01:00:02.338 --> 01:00:07.633
Are the accusers always holy? were they
born this morning as pure as God's fingers?

01:00:08.553 --> 01:00:11.011
l'll tell you what's walking Salem:
vengeance.

01:00:11.428 --> 01:00:16.100
The crazy children are jangling the keys of
the kingdom and vengeance writes the law!

01:00:16.308 --> 01:00:19.477
l will not give my wife to vengeance!

01:00:26.775 --> 01:00:29.152
l think l must go with them.

01:00:43.498 --> 01:00:47.752
Mary, there is bread enough for morning.
You will bake in the afternoon.

01:00:53.341 --> 01:00:57.551
- Heed your father. Help him.
- Yes, Mother.

01:00:57.759 --> 01:00:59.763
l'll bring her home soon.

01:00:59.971 --> 01:01:02.391
Aye, John, bring me soon.

01:01:06.436 --> 01:01:08.354
Be good, my boys.

01:01:09.854 --> 01:01:12.524
l will fall like an ocean on that court.

01:01:13.524 --> 01:01:15.527
Fear nothing, Elizabeth.

01:01:19.571 --> 01:01:22.158
Let go. Let go, Joseph.

01:01:25.785 --> 01:01:27.578
l will fear nothing.

01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:31.164
- - ashamed of yourselves!

01:01:31.374 --> 01:01:34.584
How can you do this? She has children!

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:37.171
Don't you touch her!

01:01:37.629 --> 01:01:40.216
God will never forgive you!

01:01:40.424 --> 01:01:43.342
- You'll not chain her!
- Get your hands off her!

01:01:46.304 --> 01:01:48.222
l'll kill you! Damn you!

01:01:48.389 --> 01:01:53.060
ln God's name, John, let me stand
to my duty. l must chain them all!

01:01:56.521 --> 01:01:57.730
Help them, Giles!

01:02:09.407 --> 01:02:11.617
You are coming with me
to court tomorrow.

01:02:11.785 --> 01:02:16.038
You will tell the court how that poppet
come here and who stuck the needle in.

01:02:16.246 --> 01:02:18.624
l cannot charge murder on Abigail.

01:02:19.041 --> 01:02:22.669
She'll charge lechery on you,
Mr. Proctor.

01:02:22.877 --> 01:02:25.294
- My wife will not die for me.
- l cannot do it!

01:02:25.461 --> 01:02:27.464
That goodness will not die for me, Mary.

01:02:27.673 --> 01:02:30.758
- l will bring your guts into your mouth!
- They'll turn on me!

01:02:30.967 --> 01:02:35.096
You will tell the court what you know!
Make your peace with it!

01:02:35.722 --> 01:02:37.180
- Peace!
- l can't do it!

01:02:37.347 --> 01:02:39.891
l can't do it! They'll turn on me!

01:02:42.394 --> 01:02:47.650
Now hell and heaven grapple on our backs
and all our old pretense is ripped away.

01:02:47.816 --> 01:02:49.692
Aye.

01:02:49.859 --> 01:02:53.069
And God's icy wind will blow.

01:02:58.783 --> 01:03:01.660
Now, Martha Corey,
how did you know beforehand...

01:03:01.828 --> 01:03:05.246
...that Goody wofford's pigs were to die
the night of your visit?

01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:10.169
As you know well, Mr. Hathorne,
l have kept pigs all my life.

01:03:10.377 --> 01:03:14.963
And pigs that is not fed properly is very
likely to die! l had suspicions.

01:03:15.213 --> 01:03:19.843
Suspicions? You predicted the pigs
would die! How come you to know that?

01:03:20.178 --> 01:03:21.679
Mr. Hathorne!

01:03:21.929 --> 01:03:25.766
l am innocent to a witch.
l know not what a witch is.

01:03:25.974 --> 01:03:30.477
lf you know not what a witch is,
how do you know you are not one?

01:03:35.232 --> 01:03:37.359
- Excellency!
- Beware that man!

01:03:37.525 --> 01:03:42.155
we have evidence for the court!
The girls are frauds!

01:03:43.947 --> 01:03:46.533
Mary warren has come back
to tell the truth.

01:03:46.783 --> 01:03:48.159
She's a liar!

01:03:48.368 --> 01:03:49.453
who is this man?

01:03:49.662 --> 01:03:52.789
- Giles corey. And a more contentious- -
- l'm old enough to answer.

01:03:53.874 --> 01:03:58.669
l am Giles corey. l have written a deposition
which will open up your eyes, sir.

01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:01.755
This is John Proctor.
He has 300 acres.

01:04:01.923 --> 01:04:04.506
And Francis Nurse, 500 acres!

01:04:09.511 --> 01:04:11.596
The court is in recess!

01:04:27.319 --> 01:04:28.319
Your Excellency...

01:04:28.571 --> 01:04:34.033
...l never called my wife a witch.
l only said she were reading strange books.

01:04:34.241 --> 01:04:36.202
we mean no disrespect, sir.

01:04:36.369 --> 01:04:40.080
Disrespect?
This is disruption, mister!

01:04:40.247 --> 01:04:44.126
This is the highest court of the
supreme government of the province.

01:04:44.376 --> 01:04:46.043
Do you know it?

01:04:46.419 --> 01:04:47.377
who is this man?

01:04:47.669 --> 01:04:50.088
His wife's Rebecca Nurse,
condemned this morning.

01:04:50.297 --> 01:04:52.257
Nurse?

01:04:52.759 --> 01:04:54.550
lndeed.

01:04:55.801 --> 01:05:01.849
l have only good report of your character.
l'm amazed to find you in this uproar.

01:05:02.016 --> 01:05:06.145
Excellency, we have proof for your eyes.
The girls are frauds!

01:05:06.353 --> 01:05:09.981
Mary warren, we were told you were sick.
what are you about here?

01:05:10.189 --> 01:05:13.819
She has been striving with her soul,
Mr. Parris.

01:05:14.193 --> 01:05:15.361
She wants to speak.

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:19.323
Beware this man. This man is
set and bound to destroy my ministry.

01:05:19.490 --> 01:05:21.533
You must hear this child.

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:25.787
we must do nothing but what justice
bids us do, Mr. Hale.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.790
what would you tell us, Mary warren?

01:05:38.339 --> 01:05:40.967
She never saw no spirits, sir.

01:05:41.676 --> 01:05:44.761
She'll swear to you none
of the other girls ever saw them.

01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:48.974
And you intend to spread this lie
in open court before the whole village?

01:05:49.182 --> 01:05:53.143
we were sure His Excellency would welcome
the truth, as we can prove it.

01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:58.398
Have you ever seen the devil,
Mr. Proctor?

01:06:01.276 --> 01:06:02.778
No.

01:06:02.986 --> 01:06:08.282
And there is no desire lurking in your heart
to undermine these investigations?

01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:12.953
No, sir, l come only to save my innocent
wife and my friends.

01:06:24.964 --> 01:06:27.382
what do you make of this?

01:06:27.631 --> 01:06:30.385
God help me, l cannot say...

01:06:30.551 --> 01:06:34.180
...but l'm sure the child
must be heard, Thomas...

01:06:34.388 --> 01:06:38.016
...or it will surely spread
that you've silenced her.

01:06:38.266 --> 01:06:40.810
ls this the man whose wife
is pregnant?

01:06:41.019 --> 01:06:42.770
Aye, she's the one.

01:06:47.191 --> 01:06:48.858
Your wife...

01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:52.778
...has sent me a claim
that she is pregnant now.

01:06:55.948 --> 01:06:58.284
There be no sign of it.

01:06:59.617 --> 01:07:02.039
we have examined her body.

01:07:03.705 --> 01:07:06.833
But if she says she is pregnant,
she must be.

01:07:06.999 --> 01:07:09.501
That woman will never lie, Mr. Danforth.

01:07:10.712 --> 01:07:11.711
She will not?

01:07:12.047 --> 01:07:13.505
Never, sir, never.

01:07:13.713 --> 01:07:17.843
You say you have no other purpose
than to safeguard her. very well.

01:07:18.009 --> 01:07:22.305
The law forbids harm
to the innocent child.

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:27.475
So if l tell you now that your wife
will be safe until she is delivered...

01:07:28.352 --> 01:07:31.355
...will you drop this charge?

01:07:37.777 --> 01:07:41.363
She is saved at least this year.

01:07:41.654 --> 01:07:42.989
And a year is long.

01:07:43.281 --> 01:07:46.784
Your purpose is accomplished, mister.

01:07:48.703 --> 01:07:51.831
or is your design somewhat...

01:07:52.832 --> 01:07:54.333
...larger?

01:08:01.839 --> 01:08:05.760
- My friends' wives are also accused- -
- There! He comes to overthrow the court!

01:08:05.968 --> 01:08:09.304
- l am no lawyer- -
- The pure in heart need no lawyers.

01:08:09.638 --> 01:08:13.225
Proceed as you will. And quickly.

01:08:15.351 --> 01:08:18.854
This is a sort of testament,
signed by 91 people.

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:22.691
They declare they've known
our wives over many years.

01:08:22.858 --> 01:08:24.942
Never seen no dealings with the devil.

01:08:25.151 --> 01:08:28.362
- This is an attack upon the court.
- ls every defense an attack?

01:08:28.487 --> 01:08:32.323
All innocent and christian people
are happy for the courts in Salem.

01:08:32.533 --> 01:08:34.033
These are gloomy for it.

01:08:34.285 --> 01:08:37.036
l think you must wish to know why.

01:08:43.001 --> 01:08:44.502
Mr. cheever.

01:08:44.752 --> 01:08:49.130
Have warrants drawn for all of these.
Arrest for examination.

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:54.301
- They've done no wrong.
- l have brought trouble on these people.

01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:58.346
Not if they are of good conscience,
Mr. Nurse.

01:08:59.098 --> 01:09:01.475
You misunderstand, sir.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.769
A person is either with this court
or against it.

01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:07.729
There be no road between.

01:09:08.481 --> 01:09:11.024
This is a new time.

01:09:11.567 --> 01:09:14.319
A precise time.

01:09:15.487 --> 01:09:20.116
we live no longer
in the dusky afternoon...

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:25.830
...when evil mixed itself with good
and befuddled the world.

01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:32.669
Now, by God's grace, the good folk
and the evil entirely separate.

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:39.759
l hope you will find your place
with us.

01:09:57.774 --> 01:09:59.775
Mr. Herrick...

01:10:00.275 --> 01:10:05.030
...find Mr. Putnam
and bring him here to me.

01:10:06.782 --> 01:10:08.826
This is...

01:10:09.784 --> 01:10:13.912
...very well- phrased.
You have no legal training?

01:10:14.455 --> 01:10:18.751
l have the best, sir.
l am 33 time in court in my life.

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.669
And always plaintiff too.

01:10:22.127 --> 01:10:25.173
Your father tried a case of mine once.

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:29.718
Might be 35 year ago, l think.

01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:31.513
Did he?

01:10:33.013 --> 01:10:34.972
He never spoke to you of it?

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:38.350
No, l'm afraid l cannot recall it.

01:10:38.602 --> 01:10:42.563
well, that's strange.
He give me 5 pound damages.

01:10:43.313 --> 01:10:47.109
Did he? well done.

01:10:47.817 --> 01:10:49.694
Mr. Putnam.

01:10:50.361 --> 01:10:53.740
we have an accusation by Mr. corey
against you.

01:10:53.989 --> 01:10:58.076
He states that you prompted your daughter
to cry witchery upon George Jacobs...

01:10:58.242 --> 01:11:01.997
...so that you might buy up
his forfeited land.

01:11:05.125 --> 01:11:06.082
lt is a lie.

01:11:06.291 --> 01:11:08.837
This man is killing his neighbors
for their land!

01:11:09.087 --> 01:11:12.756
- But where is your proof?
- The proof is there.

01:11:12.798 --> 01:11:15.300
The day his daughter cried out
on Jacobs...

01:11:15.425 --> 01:11:18.553
...he was heard to say
he bid her do it.

01:11:19.011 --> 01:11:22.181
l have it from an honest man
who was there when he said it.

01:11:22.974 --> 01:11:25.642
And the name of this man?

01:11:28.102 --> 01:11:29.563
why...

01:11:30.439 --> 01:11:32.440
...l cannot give you his name.

01:11:32.649 --> 01:11:37.319
Then l shall have no choice but to arrest you
for contempt of court. Do you know that?

01:11:37.735 --> 01:11:39.280
This is a hearing.

01:11:39.571 --> 01:11:42.700
You cannot clap me
for contempt of a hearing.

01:11:46.703 --> 01:11:49.329
lt is a proper lawyer.

01:11:49.955 --> 01:11:51.249
very well.

01:11:52.081 --> 01:11:54.167
Mr. corey.

01:11:54.459 --> 01:11:57.462
The court is now in session.

01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:02.591
oh, my God.

01:12:24.277 --> 01:12:28.073
Your Honor, if what he says is true,
why won't he tell us this man's name?

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:31.532
lt is understandable
that he conceals the man's name.

01:12:31.782 --> 01:12:34.786
There is prodigious fear
of this court in the country.

01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:38.747
No uncorrupted man
may fear this court.

01:12:38.998 --> 01:12:40.582
None.

01:12:41.084 --> 01:12:41.960
Giles corey...

01:12:42.293 --> 01:12:44.544
...you are under arrest in contempt.

01:12:44.753 --> 01:12:45.963
Now, decide.

01:12:46.171 --> 01:12:49.674
Either you give me the man's name
who accuses Mr. Putnam...

01:12:50.425 --> 01:12:53.635
...or you will sit in jail
until you be forced...

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:56.763
...to answer our questions.
Mr. Proctor, what- -

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:59.306
l'll kill you, Putnam!
l'm not done with you!

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:00.975
Remove him.

01:13:01.224 --> 01:13:03.394
Say no more, John.
He means to hang us all!

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:06.522
Have no fear, Giles.
This will bring you home!

01:13:08.523 --> 01:13:09.900
Mary warren's deposition.

01:13:10.067 --> 01:13:13.653
She swears upon her immortal soul
she lied and her friends lie now.

01:13:13.778 --> 01:13:17.239
They never saw Satan
and no witch ever hurt them.

01:13:17.406 --> 01:13:19.491
That is the truth, sir.

01:13:28.749 --> 01:13:32.712
Excellency, clearly this goes
to the heart of the matter.

01:13:40.802 --> 01:13:44.180
ln God's name, sir, a claim so weighty
cannot be argued by a farmer.

01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:46.765
Send him home
and let him return with a lawyer.

01:13:46.974 --> 01:13:49.726
- Now, look you, sir- -
- l have signed 1 7 death warrants!

01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:52.770
This argument you must let lawyers
present to you!

01:13:52.855 --> 01:13:54.939
For a man of such terrible learning...

01:13:55.105 --> 01:13:59.651
...you are most bewildered, Mr. Hale.
Do forgive me.

01:13:59.943 --> 01:14:04.322
l have been 42 year at the bar
and were l called...

01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:09.202
...to defend these people,
l promise you, l should be confounded.

01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:10.578
consider, now.

01:14:11.745 --> 01:14:13.914
ln an ordinary crime...

01:14:14.164 --> 01:14:17.793
...witnesses are called
to prove guilt or innocence.

01:14:18.043 --> 01:14:22.630
But witchcraft is an invisible crime.

01:14:22.756 --> 01:14:26.925
Therefore, who may witness it?
The witch, of course.

01:14:27.133 --> 01:14:28.259
And the victim.

01:14:28.884 --> 01:14:33.181
Now, we cannot expect the witch
to accuse herself, can we?

01:14:33.306 --> 01:14:36.600
Therefore, we may only rely
upon her victims.

01:14:36.767 --> 01:14:40.853
And the children certainly testify.

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:44.899
Therefore, what is left for a lawyer
to bring out?

01:14:47.236 --> 01:14:50.321
But this one claims
the girls are not truthful.

01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:53.782
But that is precisely
what l am about to consider.

01:14:54.032 --> 01:14:56.409
what more may you ask of me?

01:14:59.246 --> 01:15:02.372
Mr. Herrick, bring the children here.

01:15:03.415 --> 01:15:06.919
- l should like to question Mary.
- will you be silent?!

01:15:11.964 --> 01:15:13.133
Enter.

01:15:42.158 --> 01:15:43.784
children.

01:15:44.242 --> 01:15:48.747
The Bible damns all liars.

01:15:51.749 --> 01:15:53.293
Your friend, Mary warren...

01:15:53.418 --> 01:15:58.631
...has given us a deposition stating
that she never saw familiar spirits...

01:15:58.673 --> 01:16:03.718
...and was never attacked
by any manifest of the devil.

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:09.264
She claims as well that you never saw
these things either...

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:13.434
...and that you are all pretending.

01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:20.567
Now, it may be that Satan
has conquered Mary...

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:24.737
...and sent her here today
to distract our sacred purpose.

01:16:24.945 --> 01:16:27.031
lf so...

01:16:27.364 --> 01:16:29.241
...her neck...

01:16:29.615 --> 01:16:32.035
...will break for it.

01:16:34.787 --> 01:16:37.247
But if she speak true...

01:16:38.122 --> 01:16:42.085
...l bid you all confess
your pretense now...

01:16:43.295 --> 01:16:48.215
...for a quick confession
will go easier with you.

01:16:50.926 --> 01:16:53.219
Abigail williams.

01:16:55.138 --> 01:16:58.891
- ls there any truth in this?
- No, sir.

01:17:01.727 --> 01:17:06.232
The poppet that were discovered
in the Proctor house.

01:17:06.398 --> 01:17:08.358
She claims she made it in the court...

01:17:08.651 --> 01:17:11.943
...and that you saw her stick
the needle into it for safekeeping.

01:17:12.027 --> 01:17:13.196
That is a lie, sir.

01:17:13.237 --> 01:17:15.364
Did you see Goody Proctor's spirit?

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:19.450
And did she stab you,
as you have charged?

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:23.663
Goody Proctor sent her spirit
and it stabbed me.

01:17:28.166 --> 01:17:29.877
lf she is lying...

01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:33.547
...it can only mean
she would see your wife hanged.

01:17:36.299 --> 01:17:37.717
She would wish that, sir.

01:17:38.593 --> 01:17:41.302
This child would murder your wife?

01:17:41.386 --> 01:17:43.596
That is not a child.

01:17:44.765 --> 01:17:47.767
Mary, tell how she led you
to dance in the woods.

01:17:47.934 --> 01:17:51.270
This man is blackening my name
since l came to Salem.

01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:52.980
what is this dancing?

01:17:53.147 --> 01:17:55.565
Mr. Parris discovered them
in the dead of night.

01:17:55.690 --> 01:17:57.525
- And they have danced naked.
- Naked?

01:17:57.775 --> 01:18:00.654
when l first arrived,
Mr. Parris told me that.

01:18:00.779 --> 01:18:04.782
- l did not say they were naked.
- But she have danced?

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.493
Aye.

01:18:28.929 --> 01:18:30.721
Mary warren.

01:18:30.888 --> 01:18:33.891
lf you will permit me, Excellency.

01:18:39.937 --> 01:18:43.233
Mary, in the court you would faint...

01:18:43.524 --> 01:18:47.235
...when people accused of witchery
sent their spirit out to choke you.

01:18:47.861 --> 01:18:49.656
That were pretense, sir.

01:18:49.781 --> 01:18:52.448
But your skin turned icy and pale.

01:18:52.615 --> 01:18:55.242
They are all marvelous pretenders.

01:18:55.408 --> 01:18:58.746
Then can she pretend to faint now?

01:19:01.999 --> 01:19:06.670
why not? lf it were
all pretense, pretend now.

01:19:06.878 --> 01:19:09.964
come. Turn cold, Mary.

01:19:10.215 --> 01:19:11.383
Faint.

01:19:24.726 --> 01:19:28.230
- l cannot faint now.
- can you not pretend it?

01:19:38.863 --> 01:19:40.699
l have no sense of it now.

01:19:40.949 --> 01:19:44.243
why? what is lacking now?

01:19:44.452 --> 01:19:48.039
ls it that we have
no afflicting spirit loose...

01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:50.374
...but at the trials there were some?

01:19:50.624 --> 01:19:52.376
l never saw no spirits.

01:19:52.584 --> 01:19:54.753
Then faint by your own will.

01:19:55.171 --> 01:19:57.131
come, do it.

01:20:07.722 --> 01:20:09.225
l can't!

01:20:09.558 --> 01:20:13.645
Are you protecting Satan? confess!
You did see attacking spirits!

01:20:13.895 --> 01:20:17.065
No! l only thought l saw them,
but l did not!

01:20:17.566 --> 01:20:19.275
Your Honor.

01:20:19.525 --> 01:20:22.735
l heard the other girls screaming...

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:25.739
...and you seemed to believe them.

01:20:25.906 --> 01:20:30.617
And then the whole world cried
''Spirits! Spirits!'' and....

01:20:46.715 --> 01:20:48.258
child.

01:20:49.217 --> 01:20:53.013
l must ask you to search your heart.

01:20:53.555 --> 01:20:57.558
ls it possible the spirits you have seen
may be illusion only?

01:20:57.724 --> 01:21:00.560
- This is a base question.
- l only ask you to consider- -

01:21:00.728 --> 01:21:02.395
And what shall l consider?

01:21:02.562 --> 01:21:05.689
Have l seen my blood running
out of my flesh or have l not?

01:21:06.022 --> 01:21:09.860
ls this my reward for risking my life,
to be mistrusted and denied?

01:21:10.568 --> 01:21:13.488
oh, my child, l do not mistrust.

01:21:13.696 --> 01:21:15.241
Beware, Mr. Danforth.

01:21:16.116 --> 01:21:19.619
Do you think yourself so mighty
the devil may not turn your wits?

01:21:19.744 --> 01:21:21.203
what say you?

01:21:23.247 --> 01:21:27.375
Satan is no respecter of persons,
Mr. Danforth. He may corrupt anyone!

01:21:30.503 --> 01:21:33.131
l feel the power of hell in this room!

01:21:37.385 --> 01:21:38.719
oh, Abby, no!

01:21:40.261 --> 01:21:42.055
A wind!

01:21:43.056 --> 01:21:44.098
A cold wind!

01:21:45.683 --> 01:21:48.978
- Your Honor, l freeze!
- They're pretending.

01:21:49.853 --> 01:21:52.105
She is cold as ice, Your Honor!

01:21:52.272 --> 01:21:53.691
Mary, stop this wind!

01:21:53.899 --> 01:21:56.609
- Do you witch her?
- No.

01:21:56.734 --> 01:21:58.153
Take back your spirit.

01:21:58.362 --> 01:22:00.446
Let me go! l cannot do it!

01:22:00.696 --> 01:22:03.740
oh, heavenly Father!
Take away this torment!

01:22:03.907 --> 01:22:08.328
- whore! How do you call heaven?
- Proctor, for God's sakes!

01:22:08.579 --> 01:22:11.205
- lt is a whore, Mr. Danforth!
- He lies!

01:22:11.455 --> 01:22:15.501
Mark her now! She'll stab me
with a scream, but she is a whore!

01:22:15.834 --> 01:22:19.713
This will not pass.
You will prove this.

01:22:25.342 --> 01:22:28.054
l have known her, sir.

01:22:35.561 --> 01:22:37.645
l have known her.

01:22:42.024 --> 01:22:45.569
ln what time? what place?

01:22:45.735 --> 01:22:49.989
ln the proper place,
where my beasts are bedded.

01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:54.868
My dear, good wife saw her for what she is
and put her out on the highroad.

01:22:55.117 --> 01:22:58.247
And being what she is,
a lump of vanity...

01:22:58.539 --> 01:23:02.458
...she thinks to dance with me
on my wife's grave, and well she might- -

01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:05.419
God help me, l lusted!

01:23:09.381 --> 01:23:12.718
For this is a whore's vengeance now.

01:23:20.182 --> 01:23:22.809
l place myself entirely in your hands.

01:23:24.645 --> 01:23:29.399
Do you deny every scrap
and speck of this?

01:23:29.607 --> 01:23:31.692
lf l must answer that question...

01:23:31.984 --> 01:23:37.238
...l will leave and never come back and l will
tell the world that Satan has won Salem!

01:23:37.404 --> 01:23:38.740
Your Honor.

01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:43.203
what man will cast away his good name?

01:23:48.874 --> 01:23:50.917
what look do you give me?

01:23:54.379 --> 01:23:56.381
l will not have such look!

01:23:57.214 --> 01:24:00.050
You will not leave this room.

01:24:03.721 --> 01:24:05.054
Mr. Parris.

01:24:05.722 --> 01:24:08.183
Go to the jail
and bring Goodwife Proctor here.

01:24:08.516 --> 01:24:10.185
Excellency, this is all a snare.

01:24:10.309 --> 01:24:11.476
Bring her.

01:24:24.822 --> 01:24:25.865
Now...

01:24:26.156 --> 01:24:30.244
...we shall touch the bottom
of this swamp.

01:24:32.995 --> 01:24:37.208
Your wife, Mr. Proctor,
you say is an honest woman.

01:24:38.918 --> 01:24:41.337
ln her life, sir, she have never lied.

01:24:41.587 --> 01:24:44.631
And when she put this
girl out of your house...

01:24:45.507 --> 01:24:50.011
...she put her out for a harlot
and knew of her a harlot?

01:24:50.177 --> 01:24:53.139
Aye, sir, she knew her for a harlot.

01:24:57.643 --> 01:25:02.355
lf she tell me, child,
it were for harlotry...

01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:06.859
...may God spread his mercy on you.

01:25:56.319 --> 01:25:57.487
Hold.

01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:03.199
Turn your back.

01:26:06.452 --> 01:26:08.079
Turn your back.

01:26:10.873 --> 01:26:12.375
Do likewise.

01:26:15.418 --> 01:26:18.422
No one may speak...

01:26:18.630 --> 01:26:22.133
...or gesture aye or nay.

01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:25.761
Mr. cheever.

01:26:26.888 --> 01:26:30.598
Report this testimony
in all exactness.

01:26:34.435 --> 01:26:35.644
Enter!

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:08.465
You will look at
me only, Goody Proctor.

01:27:09.549 --> 01:27:12.342
ln my eyes only.

01:27:17.222 --> 01:27:23.395
we are informed that at one time you
dismissed your servant, Abigail williams.

01:27:25.938 --> 01:27:28.316
why? For what cause?

01:27:29.691 --> 01:27:32.110
Need not look at your husband.

01:27:32.778 --> 01:27:35.238
The answer is in your memory.

01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:39.825
why did you dismiss Abigail williams?

01:27:43.203 --> 01:27:47.624
She dissatisfied me and my husband.

01:27:48.123 --> 01:27:51.543
ln what way dissatisfied you?

01:27:53.171 --> 01:27:55.797
- She were- -
- Look at me.

01:27:58.384 --> 01:28:00.344
were she slovenly?

01:28:01.304 --> 01:28:04.305
Lazy? what was it?

01:28:06.642 --> 01:28:08.017
Your Honor....

01:28:20.069 --> 01:28:22.322
My husband...

01:28:25.656 --> 01:28:27.783
...is a good and righteous man.

01:28:28.034 --> 01:28:31.246
He's never drunk or wasting his time
at the shovelboard.

01:28:31.412 --> 01:28:34.206
But l were a long time sick last year.

01:28:34.748 --> 01:28:37.918
And l thought l saw him turning
from me. And this girl....

01:28:38.126 --> 01:28:40.795
- Look at me.
- Aye, sir.

01:28:43.589 --> 01:28:46.134
what of Abigail williams?

01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:51.472
l came to think he fancied her.

01:28:53.932 --> 01:28:58.353
And so one night l lost my wits, l think,
and put her out on the highroad.

01:28:58.645 --> 01:29:02.189
And did he indeed turn from you?

01:29:05.276 --> 01:29:06.276
He....

01:29:06.485 --> 01:29:08.778
To your own knowledge...

01:29:09.695 --> 01:29:13.950
...has John Proctor committed
the crime of lechery?

01:29:17.452 --> 01:29:19.913
Answer my question.

01:29:22.082 --> 01:29:26.294
ls your husband an adulterer?

01:29:38.221 --> 01:29:39.179
No, sir.

01:29:40.889 --> 01:29:41.850
Remove her.

01:29:42.058 --> 01:29:43.725
Elizabeth, l've confessed it.

01:29:44.059 --> 01:29:46.061
- oh, God.
- l beg you, stop now!

01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:50.481
- She spoke nothing of lechery.
- lt is a natural lie to tell!

01:29:50.690 --> 01:29:54.401
Judge Danforth, l cannot shut
my conscience to it! l believe this man!

01:29:54.609 --> 01:29:57.111
Private vengeancy is working
through this testimony!

01:29:57.363 --> 01:29:59.947
By my oath to heaven,
this girl is false!

01:30:02.074 --> 01:30:03.743
- what is it?
- what's there?

01:30:03.952 --> 01:30:06.411
lt's on the beam.
Beneath the rafter!

01:30:06.912 --> 01:30:08.997
why do you come, yellow bird?

01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:11.792
But you cannot want to tear my face!

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.793
Envy is a deadly sin, Mary!

01:30:15.296 --> 01:30:17.589
This is a black art,
to change your shape.

01:30:17.755 --> 01:30:20.299
- Abby, l'm here!
- No, Mary, don't come down!

01:30:23.427 --> 01:30:26.179
- l'm not hurting her!
- why does she see you up there?

01:30:26.388 --> 01:30:28.473
- She sees nothing!
- ''She sees nothing!''

01:30:28.681 --> 01:30:31.434
- Have you compacted with the devil?
- Never. Never!

01:30:31.643 --> 01:30:33.186
''Never! Never!''

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:35.855
- why must they repeat you?
- They're sporting!

01:30:36.062 --> 01:30:37.230
''They're sporting!''

01:30:37.439 --> 01:30:39.441
- Abby, stop it!
- ''Abby, stop it!''

01:30:39.607 --> 01:30:40.775
- Stop it!
- ''Stop it!''

01:30:41.025 --> 01:30:44.528
- Stop it!
- ''Stop it!''

01:30:45.279 --> 01:30:49.367
what brought you to this turnabout,
Mary warren? Has the devil got to you?

01:30:49.575 --> 01:30:51.076
God damns all liars, Mary.

01:30:51.284 --> 01:30:54.912
Have you made compact with the devil
to destroy this investigation?

01:30:55.122 --> 01:30:57.832
- Hold to the truth.
- what brought this change in you?

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:00.709
You have made compact with the devil,
have you not?

01:31:00.918 --> 01:31:03.003
She's spreading her wings!

01:31:03.753 --> 01:31:05.131
She's coming!

01:31:07.799 --> 01:31:10.051
Look out! She's coming down!

01:31:16.806 --> 01:31:19.017
You will put an end to this now!

01:31:20.184 --> 01:31:24.229
l'm telling you, sir! l know this girl!
She's entirely false!

01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:33.821
Run!

01:31:34.029 --> 01:31:35.114
Grab them all!

01:31:35.322 --> 01:31:37.450
They're running to the sea!

01:31:45.582 --> 01:31:46.958
Stop them!

01:31:49.251 --> 01:31:50.293
Stop them!

01:32:09.644 --> 01:32:11.395
Get your hands off me!

01:32:11.604 --> 01:32:13.023
Don't touch me!

01:32:14.858 --> 01:32:16.943
You're the devil's man!

01:32:17.818 --> 01:32:19.945
l go your way no more!

01:32:20.154 --> 01:32:22.239
l love God!

01:32:24.073 --> 01:32:26.867
He bid you do the devil's work?

01:32:27.035 --> 01:32:29.787
He come at me by night to sign.

01:32:29.954 --> 01:32:31.871
- Sign what?
- The devil's book?

01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:35.709
- He come with a book?
- My name! He want my name!

01:32:35.875 --> 01:32:38.754
''l'll murder you,'' he says,
''if my wife hangs!''

01:32:38.961 --> 01:32:42.507
''we must go and overthrow
the court,'' he says.

01:32:42.716 --> 01:32:44.342
No, l go your way no more!

01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:46.093
This girl's gone wild!

01:32:46.302 --> 01:32:48.093
l love God.

01:32:49.178 --> 01:32:50.515
l bless God!

01:32:52.097 --> 01:32:54.892
oh, Abby, l'll never hurt you.

01:32:57.311 --> 01:32:58.563
John Proctor!

01:33:00.897 --> 01:33:03.192
l have seen your power!

01:33:04.901 --> 01:33:08.529
You are combined with Antichrist!

01:33:09.779 --> 01:33:10.866
You will not deny it.

01:33:11.032 --> 01:33:14.994
- Excellency, this man- -
- l'll have nothing from you, Mr. Hale!

01:33:16.786 --> 01:33:18.955
will you confess yourself...

01:33:19.164 --> 01:33:20.873
...befouled with hell...

01:33:22.833 --> 01:33:26.087
...or do you keep that
black allegiance yet?

01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:27.795
what say you?

01:33:29.797 --> 01:33:34.594
l say you are pulling heaven down
and raising up a whore.

01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:44.894
l say God is dead!

01:33:45.103 --> 01:33:46.604
Do you hear him?

01:33:47.521 --> 01:33:48.731
Do you hear him?

01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:58.823
John Proctor, you're dead!

01:34:05.829 --> 01:34:07.579
l quit this court!

01:34:20.592 --> 01:34:22.510
Having committed witchcraft...

01:34:23.136 --> 01:34:24.512
...Rebecca Nurse...

01:34:24.721 --> 01:34:25.931
...George Jacobs...

01:34:26.139 --> 01:34:28.265
...Mary Eastey, John willard...

01:34:28.473 --> 01:34:29.556
...Martha corey...

01:34:29.766 --> 01:34:31.309
...Elizabeth Howe...

01:34:31.518 --> 01:34:34.438
...John Proctor, Elizabeth Proctor...

01:34:34.646 --> 01:34:37.315
...Mary Sibber, Hannah Bellows...

01:34:37.523 --> 01:34:40.193
...Bridget Bishop and Sarah osborne...

01:34:40.442 --> 01:34:41.819
...are from this church...

01:34:42.027 --> 01:34:45.488
...with all its blessings
and every hope of heaven...

01:34:45.656 --> 01:34:48.033
...hereby excommunicate.

01:34:55.455 --> 01:34:56.707
No, l'm innocent.

01:35:06.257 --> 01:35:07.884
l am no witch!

01:35:08.093 --> 01:35:10.177
You'll all burn in hell!

01:35:57.093 --> 01:36:00.679
Purge your contempt. Give us the name
of the man that accused Putnam!

01:36:01.305 --> 01:36:02.514
You will say it!

01:36:02.722 --> 01:36:05.142
Speak, man! we cannot relent!

01:36:05.851 --> 01:36:07.560
what say you, corey?

01:36:07.727 --> 01:36:09.353
More...

01:36:09.728 --> 01:36:10.896
...weight.

01:36:14.024 --> 01:36:15.400
Lay on.

01:36:18.611 --> 01:36:21.323
You are commanded
by the court. Lay on!

01:37:26.046 --> 01:37:28.005
I cannot sleep, sir.

01:37:28.797 --> 01:37:32.885
A woman comes to my bed
every night now and tears at my eyes.

01:37:33.094 --> 01:37:36.930
can you make out who she may be?

01:37:39.557 --> 01:37:42.894
l believe she be
Reverend John Hale's wife, sir.

01:37:46.397 --> 01:37:48.857
You must be mistaken, my child.

01:37:49.608 --> 01:37:53.320
- The wife of a minister is not likely- -
- Satan may reach anyone, sir.

01:37:53.569 --> 01:37:57.947
why, then, absolutely no one
in the world is safe?

01:37:58.114 --> 01:37:59.616
ls that your meaning?

01:38:00.451 --> 01:38:02.702
You are mistaken, child.

01:38:04.497 --> 01:38:06.456
You understand me?

01:38:13.586 --> 01:38:15.714
The williams girl.

01:38:17.341 --> 01:38:19.300
come away from her.

01:38:20.551 --> 01:38:23.012
God forgive you, Abigail williams.

01:38:27.181 --> 01:38:29.768
l beseech you, Thomas.

01:38:29.976 --> 01:38:31.977
lt must end. Now.

01:38:33.062 --> 01:38:37.649
lt has struck the people very hard
that so many will not confess.

01:38:38.651 --> 01:38:42.445
There's a faction here, Thomas,
feeding on that noose.

01:38:43.738 --> 01:38:45.782
They're sick of hanging.

01:38:48.075 --> 01:38:52.163
l tell you, Samuel,
l shall not rest...

01:38:52.371 --> 01:38:56.874
...until every inch of this province...

01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:02.088
...belongs again to God.

01:39:31.696 --> 01:39:32.905
Quickly!

01:39:36.327 --> 01:39:37.451
l've got it.

01:39:48.879 --> 01:39:51.631
They mean to take you this morning.

01:39:52.841 --> 01:39:56.719
There's a ship in Boston Harbor.
lt's bound for the Barbados.

01:39:56.927 --> 01:39:58.803
l have money for the guard.

01:40:04.767 --> 01:40:07.853
l never dreamed any of this for you.

01:40:16.193 --> 01:40:18.613
l wanted you, was all.

01:40:26.454 --> 01:40:28.329
Listen to me, John.

01:40:28.579 --> 01:40:30.248
l have money.

01:40:30.915 --> 01:40:33.792
we could see tomorrow on the ocean.

01:40:34.001 --> 01:40:37.546
The jailer will let you go.
Let me call him.

01:40:39.716 --> 01:40:42.383
l must board ship, John.

01:40:43.844 --> 01:40:45.969
will you not speak?

01:40:50.098 --> 01:40:53.685
lt's not on a ship we'll
meet again, Abigail...

01:40:53.852 --> 01:40:55.562
...but in hell.

01:41:12.785 --> 01:41:16.080
- vanished?!
- She's run off with 31 pound.

01:41:17.165 --> 01:41:20.500
- l am penniless.
- Mr. Parris...

01:41:21.125 --> 01:41:25.796
...you are a brainless man.

01:41:26.297 --> 01:41:28.923
Excellency, hear me, l beg you.

01:41:30.467 --> 01:41:33.470
Let us postpone more hangings
for a time.

01:41:33.887 --> 01:41:35.346
Now, these three...

01:41:35.763 --> 01:41:40.433
...that must die this morning, John Proctor,
Rebecca Nurse, Martha corey...

01:41:40.642 --> 01:41:43.103
...they have great weight yet in the town.

01:41:43.311 --> 01:41:46.398
Now, if you let them stand
upon the scaffold...

01:41:46.564 --> 01:41:51.485
...and send up some innocent prayer,
then they will wake a vengeance on you.

01:41:51.694 --> 01:41:53.946
Then Proctor must confess.

01:41:54.238 --> 01:41:55.322
Now!

01:41:55.572 --> 01:41:57.198
He must confess.

01:42:03.204 --> 01:42:05.163
where are you taking her?

01:42:06.541 --> 01:42:09.209
where are you taking her?

01:42:27.016 --> 01:42:29.060
Pray, be at your ease.

01:42:29.561 --> 01:42:31.896
we come not for your life. we- -

01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:38.234
Mr. Hale.

01:42:42.823 --> 01:42:45.824
John is marked to hang this morning.

01:42:49.245 --> 01:42:53.039
l have no connection with
the court, Goody Proctor.

01:42:53.247 --> 01:42:56.501
l come to save your husband's life.
Do you understand me?

01:42:57.585 --> 01:43:00.588
we must help John give
them the lie they demand.

01:43:00.754 --> 01:43:03.173
lt is no lie.
You cannot speak of lies.

01:43:03.381 --> 01:43:06.050
lt is a lie. They're innocent.

01:43:11.097 --> 01:43:15.600
l tell you, woman,
life is God's most precious gift.

01:43:17.477 --> 01:43:21.898
No principle, however glorious,
may justify the taking of it.

01:43:23.107 --> 01:43:25.401
will you plead with him?

01:43:26.319 --> 01:43:28.195
Let him give his lie.

01:43:29.653 --> 01:43:32.907
lt may be that God damns a liar less
than he that...

01:43:33.157 --> 01:43:35.659
...throws away his life for pride.

01:43:35.868 --> 01:43:39.245
l think that may be
the devil's argument.

01:43:40.039 --> 01:43:41.623
Are you stone?

01:43:43.041 --> 01:43:45.043
He will die with the morning.

01:43:45.918 --> 01:43:50.631
But if he will confess, you shall
both be at home tomorrow.

01:44:05.143 --> 01:44:07.102
l promise nothing.

01:44:08.147 --> 01:44:10.732
But let me speak with him alone.

01:44:25.661 --> 01:44:26.704
The child?

01:44:29.081 --> 01:44:30.500
lt grows.

01:44:37.338 --> 01:44:39.506
No word of the boys?

01:44:39.924 --> 01:44:41.425
They're well.

01:44:41.884 --> 01:44:43.927
Rebecca's Francis keeps them.

01:44:44.635 --> 01:44:47.722
- But you have not seen them?
- l have not.

01:44:55.021 --> 01:44:57.021
They come for my life now.

01:45:17.331 --> 01:45:22.003
l'm thinking l will confess, Elizabeth.
what say you if l give them that?

01:45:25.797 --> 01:45:27.007
lf l confess?

01:45:30.718 --> 01:45:32.803
l cannot judge you, John.

01:45:38.183 --> 01:45:40.144
what would you have me do?

01:45:40.643 --> 01:45:42.938
As you will, l would have it.

01:45:44.564 --> 01:45:46.440
l want you living, that's sure.

01:45:46.731 --> 01:45:50.652
How can l mount the scaffold
like a saint? l'm not that man.

01:45:51.236 --> 01:45:53.947
lt is a pretense. My honesty's broke.

01:45:57.283 --> 01:46:00.744
Nothing's spoiled giving them this lie
that were not...

01:46:01.412 --> 01:46:03.037
...rotten long before.

01:46:04.039 --> 01:46:06.708
And yet you've not confessed till now.

01:46:10.919 --> 01:46:14.090
lt's only spite keeps me silent.

01:46:14.298 --> 01:46:16.716
lt's hard to give a lie to dogs.

01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:31.271
l would have your forgiveness,
Elizabeth.

01:46:34.441 --> 01:46:38.402
lt is not for me to give, John,
if you will not pardon yourself.

01:46:46.242 --> 01:46:50.163
lt is not my soul, John. lt is yours.

01:46:53.457 --> 01:46:55.126
only be sure that...

01:46:56.293 --> 01:46:59.755
...whatever you will do,
it is a good man does it.

01:46:59.963 --> 01:47:02.172
l have sins of my own to count.

01:47:05.009 --> 01:47:07.428
lt needs a cold wife
to prompt lechery.

01:47:07.636 --> 01:47:09.304
oh, enough. Enough.

01:47:10.305 --> 01:47:13.767
lt's better that you should know me.
You take my sins upon you.

01:47:13.975 --> 01:47:15.559
No, l take my own.

01:47:15.727 --> 01:47:17.228
l take my own.

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:20.605
John....

01:47:26.235 --> 01:47:29.989
l counted myself so plain...

01:47:30.197 --> 01:47:34.201
...so poorly made that no
honest love could come to me.

01:47:36.995 --> 01:47:39.456
Suspicion kissed you when l did.

01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:45.836
l never knew how l should say my love.

01:47:47.505 --> 01:47:50.633
lt were a cold house l kept.

01:47:50.924 --> 01:47:54.510
oh, my love. My love.

01:47:55.345 --> 01:47:58.848
Forgive me. l never knew
such goodness in the world.

01:47:59.015 --> 01:48:02.977
- oh, John, forgive me.
- My love.

01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:05.602
Forgive me.

01:48:07.522 --> 01:48:09.523
Forgive me.

01:48:14.151 --> 01:48:16.572
Forgive me.

01:48:18.405 --> 01:48:20.616
l want my life!

01:48:20.825 --> 01:48:22.870
God be praised!

01:48:23.078 --> 01:48:24.620
He will confess!

01:48:25.454 --> 01:48:28.289
- This is God's work!
- Bring out the condemned!

01:48:28.707 --> 01:48:31.127
Rebecca Nurse! Martha corey!

01:48:34.587 --> 01:48:36.046
why must it be written?

01:48:36.254 --> 01:48:41.926
why, for the good instruction of the village.
This we shall post upon the church door.

01:48:43.679 --> 01:48:45.430
John.

01:48:46.681 --> 01:48:47.765
courage, man.

01:48:48.015 --> 01:48:51.726
Your good example may
bring them to God as well.

01:48:51.936 --> 01:48:55.147
Hear this, Goody Nurse.

01:48:56.357 --> 01:48:57.939
Now, Mr. Proctor.

01:48:58.609 --> 01:49:02.195
Did you bind yourself
to the devil's service?

01:49:03.695 --> 01:49:05.197
oh, John, not you!

01:49:07.824 --> 01:49:08.826
l did.

01:49:09.034 --> 01:49:11.201
Now, woman, you see?

01:49:11.452 --> 01:49:15.914
lt profit nothing to keep
this conspiracy any further.

01:49:16.165 --> 01:49:18.459
will you confess yourself with him?

01:49:18.626 --> 01:49:20.169
lt is a lie!

01:49:20.419 --> 01:49:23.463
lt is a lie! How may l damn myself?

01:49:24.422 --> 01:49:27.217
God send his mercy on you, John.

01:49:27.426 --> 01:49:28.717
Now.

01:49:29.301 --> 01:49:31.053
Mr. Proctor...

01:49:31.969 --> 01:49:35.849
...when the devil appeared to you,
did you see Rebecca Nurse...

01:49:36.058 --> 01:49:37.808
...in his company?

01:49:44.065 --> 01:49:45.231
No.

01:49:48.443 --> 01:49:52.405
Did you see her sister,
Mary Eastey, with the devil?

01:49:52.738 --> 01:49:53.738
No, l did not.

01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:58.119
Did you ever see Giles corey
with the devil? or his wife?

01:49:58.327 --> 01:50:00.163
l did not see them.

01:50:00.454 --> 01:50:04.625
Did you ever see anyone with the devil?

01:50:07.919 --> 01:50:09.419
No, l did not.

01:50:09.628 --> 01:50:12.590
Let him sign it.
lt is enough he confessed himself.

01:50:12.798 --> 01:50:16.843
lt is a weighty name, sir. lt will strike
the village that Proctor confess.

01:50:17.051 --> 01:50:19.637
Let him sign and be done with it,
for God's sake!

01:50:19.805 --> 01:50:20.972
Thomas!

01:51:21.316 --> 01:51:22.691
lf you please, mister.

01:51:22.901 --> 01:51:25.319
You've seen me sign it.
You've no need of this.

01:51:25.528 --> 01:51:28.655
- Proctor, the village must have proof.
- Damn the village!

01:51:28.947 --> 01:51:31.659
ls there no good penitence
but it be public?

01:51:31.868 --> 01:51:35.996
God does not need my name nailed
to the church. God knows my sins!

01:51:36.204 --> 01:51:37.162
Now, look, you- -

01:51:37.331 --> 01:51:40.749
How may l teach my sons to walk like men
and l sold my friends?

01:51:40.916 --> 01:51:42.959
You have not sold your- -

01:51:43.168 --> 01:51:46.420
l blacken all of them
when they have hanged for silence!

01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:50.883
l must have good and legal proof
that you have confessed to witchcraft.

01:51:51.258 --> 01:51:54.595
You are the high court.
Your word is good enough.

01:51:55.804 --> 01:52:00.725
Tell them Proctor broke to his knees
and wept like a woman.

01:52:04.311 --> 01:52:05.313
But...

01:52:07.023 --> 01:52:09.067
...my name l cannot sign.

01:52:09.275 --> 01:52:13.445
why? Do you mean to deny this
confession when you are free?

01:52:13.654 --> 01:52:15.364
l mean to deny nothing.

01:52:15.613 --> 01:52:21.578
- Then explain to me why you will not- -
- Because it is my name!

01:52:22.744 --> 01:52:27.290
Because l cannot have
another in my life!

01:52:29.084 --> 01:52:33.212
Because l lie and sign myself to lies!

01:52:34.546 --> 01:52:36.590
Because l am not worth...

01:52:36.798 --> 01:52:40.301
...the dust on the feet
of them you have hanged.

01:52:41.093 --> 01:52:45.472
l have given you my soul,
leave me my name!

01:52:46.432 --> 01:52:48.683
ls that document a lie?

01:52:50.018 --> 01:52:52.687
lf it is, l will not accept it.

01:52:54.605 --> 01:52:58.608
You will give me your honest
confession in my hand...

01:52:58.819 --> 01:53:02.444
...or l cannot keep you from the rope.

01:53:03.946 --> 01:53:06.407
which way do you go, mister?

01:53:17.958 --> 01:53:18.919
Marshal.

01:53:19.293 --> 01:53:21.421
Then you will hang! You cannot!

01:53:21.671 --> 01:53:25.424
l can. And there's your
first marvel, that l can.

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:26.800
Give them no tear.

01:53:27.009 --> 01:53:31.262
Show honor now. Show a stony heart
and sink them with it!

01:53:39.185 --> 01:53:42.105
who weeps for these...

01:53:43.690 --> 01:53:47.109
...weeps for corruption.

01:53:49.862 --> 01:53:51.571
Take them.

01:53:56.701 --> 01:53:58.995
Proctor. Proctor.

01:53:59.203 --> 01:54:01.371
Go to him. There is time yet!

01:54:01.539 --> 01:54:03.124
Proctor!

01:54:04.875 --> 01:54:07.377
ln the name of God, confess!

01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:10.130
confess!

01:54:10.297 --> 01:54:12.507
woman, plead with him.

01:54:13.382 --> 01:54:15.884
Be his helper. Go to him.

01:54:16.134 --> 01:54:18.430
Take his shame away!

01:54:21.139 --> 01:54:24.142
He have his goodness now.

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:29.104
God forbid l take it from him.

01:54:44.577 --> 01:54:46.579
God bless you, Rebecca!

01:54:46.745 --> 01:54:48.872
God bless you, Martha!

01:55:05.844 --> 01:55:08.098
God bless you, Rebecca!

01:55:08.682 --> 01:55:11.558
You're a good man, John Proctor!

01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:48.016
our Father, which art in heaven...

01:56:48.225 --> 01:56:50.353
...hallowed be thy name.

01:56:50.811 --> 01:56:53.898
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...

01:56:54.106 --> 01:56:56.608
...in Earth as it is in heaven.

01:56:57.568 --> 01:57:00.445
Give us this day our daily bread.

01:57:00.611 --> 01:57:02.905
Forgive us our trespasses...

01:57:03.114 --> 01:57:06.409
...as we forgive them
that trespass against us.

01:57:06.951 --> 01:57:11.580
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

01:57:11.872 --> 01:57:13.581
For thine is the kingdom...

01:57:13.789 --> 01:57:15.792
...the power and the glory...

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.545
...forever and ever!
