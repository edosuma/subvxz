WEBVTT

00:11.929 --> 00:15.098
Ghost to Phoenix Home,
we're heading down with another load.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.725
Copy, Ghost.
I'll meet you on the surface.

00:18.227 --> 00:21.145
So, one more run,
then we'll take a break.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.022
Are they still at it?

00:23.107 --> 00:24.649
Pretty much non-stop.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.701
Keep your blade up.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.828
It's easier to drop it
than it is to raise it.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.003
You know that's my move.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.547
I steal from the best.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.473
Gotcha!

00:57.808 --> 00:59.016
And I got you.

01:03.147 --> 01:04.689
Tied again?

01:04.773 --> 01:06.733
There's no such thing as a "tie."

01:06.817 --> 01:08.651
You lose, you die.

01:08.944 --> 01:11.529
Yeah, and you win
by killing an Inquisitor.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.657
No. You win by surviving.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.826
You two are getting pretty good.

01:17.202 --> 01:20.121
Getting? Are you saying
we weren't good before?

01:20.998 --> 01:23.833
I think she just meant
you're even better now.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.334
I'll take it.

01:25.961 --> 01:26.919
Hey!

01:27.004 --> 01:29.005
You never turn your back on an enemy.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.426
Okay. But since
when are you my enemy?

01:34.052 --> 01:35.344
Let's go again.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.331
I thought you'd be more excited
about our new base.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.875
We finally have a place to call home.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.835
Trust me, Hera, I'm excited.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.378
This is my excited face.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.380
Yeah, very nice.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.302
Here's that crate
of power generators, AP-5.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.055
This shipment was due hours ago.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.726
So I can expect them
to be late all the time then?

02:25.646 --> 02:28.356
The site doesn't look
like much, I'll admit.

02:28.565 --> 02:32.527
The good news is our scouts found a
fresh water source deep underground.

02:32.611 --> 02:34.904
We're placing sensor markers
around the perimeter.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.156
We'll know if anyone
drops by unannounced.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.826
Hey! Get away from that!

02:40.202 --> 02:42.411
How I hate those little bogens.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.414
This planet may be hot,
dry, and unpleasant.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.417
But at least there's nothing
trying to kill us.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.271
Hey! What?

03:10.148 --> 03:12.024
Hey! Get away from that!

03:12.442 --> 03:14.277
What are you guys doing over there?

03:16.280 --> 03:18.531
What's wrong?
Did something frighten you?

03:33.714 --> 03:36.340
I can't believe
it's all finally coming together.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.926
Ships, pilots, a base.

03:39.303 --> 03:40.803
Everything you need.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.098
Except you and Ezra.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.270
So, when do you leave?

03:49.521 --> 03:51.772
As soon as Ahsoka gets back.

03:52.816 --> 03:55.151
We can't run
from the Inquisitors forever.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.069
I figured it was something like that,

03:57.154 --> 03:58.321
with all that training.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.950
Hera, what you've accomplished
here is important.

04:03.035 --> 04:07.079
I understand that now, the need for us
to be a part of a larger rebellion.

04:07.331 --> 04:08.581
I'm behind you.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.709
But none of it will matter
if we don't do what we need to do.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.170
All sensors on the Eastern face
are in place.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.422
Good. Have all the pilots checked in?

04:16.506 --> 04:18.257
Lieutenant Deiser hasn't come back yet.

04:20.844 --> 04:24.096
Phoenix-6, report. Deiser, do you copy?

04:26.475 --> 04:29.435
She was on the North face.
We'd better go check on her.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.686
Take The Phantom.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.115
Zeb?

04:48.664 --> 04:50.665
Hey, do you know where Zeb is?

04:51.959 --> 04:54.210
Yeah, do you know where he went?

05:15.190 --> 05:17.066
What are you doing out here, big guy?

05:18.276 --> 05:19.652
Hey, Ezra.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.780
Just getting a little fresh air
and privacy.

05:22.906 --> 05:26.117
Hey, pull up a crate, watch the sunset.

05:29.371 --> 05:32.373
We're gonna be leaving soon.
Kanan and me.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.542
Yeah, I figured.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.711
Goin' after the "red blades"?

05:36.795 --> 05:40.506
Yeah, I don't know when we'll be back.
Or if we'll be back.

05:40.882 --> 05:44.385
Hey, hey, bad luck to talk like that.
You'll be back.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.680
'Course we'll probably have
toppled the Empire by then.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.974
We can swap war stories.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.559
It's a deal.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.611
Spectre-5 to Phoenix-6, where are you?

06:04.489 --> 06:06.282
Deiser, come in.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.539
Looks like whatever happened,

06:13.623 --> 06:15.833
happened right after
she placed that sensor.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.089
Someone else is here.

06:22.174 --> 06:24.300
Or something else.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.384
Behind you!

06:28.388 --> 06:29.513
Do you think it's aggressive?

06:29.598 --> 06:31.057
I'm not waiting to find out!

06:37.773 --> 06:39.148
More incoming!

06:39.232 --> 06:40.608
Get to the ship.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.531
This is Spectre-5. We're under attack!

06:47.616 --> 06:48.657
We need backup...

06:56.541 --> 06:59.210
Get off me, you lousy crawler!

06:59.669 --> 07:00.711
Rex!

07:03.840 --> 07:04.840
Rex!

07:37.040 --> 07:39.375
What are you waiting for? Come on!

07:51.888 --> 07:54.140
I hate multi-leggers.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.432
Where's Rex?

07:56.393 --> 07:57.977
Those creatures took him.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.854
I think they got Deiser too.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.439
Chopper, locate Rex's position!

08:10.407 --> 08:11.699
He says this way.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.578
I'll... I'll guard the ship.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.079
We need you, Zeb.

08:17.539 --> 08:20.541
Chopper, stay here
and keep the Ghost ready for take-off.

08:21.084 --> 08:24.587
More than two legs is just excessive.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.830
Stay sharp and stick together.

08:59.915 --> 09:02.583
They have tough armor.
Aim for the eyes.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.689
We need to split up.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.524
Ezra, go with Hera.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.777
No. Ezra, stay with Kanan.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.654
Sabine, Zeb, with me.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.491
Let's go.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.578
Shouldn't we have a Jedi
on each team?

09:39.663 --> 09:41.997
We've gotta get used
to not having them around.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.017
Let me try to connect with it.

10:02.978 --> 10:04.270
I don't think so.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.230
Trust me, I got this.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.740
Hey!

10:21.663 --> 10:23.789
Maybe I should teach you
more common sense!

10:23.873 --> 10:26.458
I had common sense before
you started teaching me!

10:26.543 --> 10:28.460
We can argue about this later.
Come on!

10:28.545 --> 10:30.796
You always change the subject
when I start winning.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.719
I don't like the looks of this.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.568
Those big crawlers must eat them.

10:53.236 --> 10:56.572
Even I wouldn't wish that fate
on these little bogens.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.787
Are those eggs?

11:03.872 --> 11:05.789
I could really use a hand over here.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.088
Rex!

11:16.926 --> 11:18.260
I met the neighbors.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.095
I don't care for 'em.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.684
Kanan! Ezra! We found Rex.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.311
Good work! We're coming to ya!

11:28.313 --> 11:30.189
Actually, I think it's time to go.

11:30.857 --> 11:31.982
This way!

12:06.476 --> 12:07.601
Aim for the eyes!

12:15.402 --> 12:17.486
Get back, ya stinkin' crawlers!

12:20.198 --> 12:21.740
They're boxing us in.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.336
Glad you could drop in.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.713
I wouldn't stand there if I were you.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.215
Come on, we'll clear a path!

12:59.904 --> 13:01.321
Chopper, open up!

13:01.406 --> 13:02.823
Chopper!

13:13.334 --> 13:15.169
This whole place is infested.

13:22.218 --> 13:25.137
Maybe this base
isn't so "perfect" after all.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.972
I'm not giving up without a fight.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.056
Hang on!

13:30.977 --> 13:32.352
Hera, get us outta here!

13:33.354 --> 13:34.521
It's no good!

13:34.606 --> 13:35.898
I'm at full power.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.608
They must have glued us down.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.109
Well, we're safe in here, right?

13:40.236 --> 13:41.278
Sure.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.514
Hungry, are ya? Well, eat this!

14:16.606 --> 14:17.606
They're all over us!

14:26.157 --> 14:27.741
Route auxiliary power to the hull.

14:27.825 --> 14:28.909
That should knock 'em off.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.793
It's not working. Hit 'em again!

14:38.127 --> 14:41.547
No. lf we drain too much power
we won't be able to lift off.

14:41.631 --> 14:44.258
I hate to break it to you,
but we're not goin' anywhere.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.677
We have to go outside
and cut the ship free.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.595
Yeah, fat chance surviving that...

14:51.641 --> 14:53.600
That's great, Zeb. I'm gonna get eaten,

14:53.685 --> 14:56.520
the last Jedi in the galaxy,
chomped up by some crawlers

14:56.604 --> 14:58.647
because you were too afraid
to go outside.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.025
We're missing something.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.069
Why didn't these things
attack us before?

15:04.153 --> 15:05.320
You're right.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.156
They could've overrun the base,
they didn't come near it.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.080
Sensor marker... That's it!

15:15.623 --> 15:18.667
Kanan! I think I know
why they didn't attack the base.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.794
Look! See that marker?

15:24.340 --> 15:25.882
When I was looking for Deiser out there,

15:25.967 --> 15:28.093
the creatures wouldn't come
anywhere close.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.511
They don't like the markers.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.597
And the base is surrounded by them!

15:31.681 --> 15:35.183
lf we can get it, we can use it
to hold them off while we clear the ship.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.978
Only problem is, how do we get to it?

15:38.313 --> 15:39.479
We got a breach!

15:39.564 --> 15:41.023
They're coming in the airlock!

15:44.736 --> 15:47.571
I'll hold 'em here.
Get out and cut the ship loose!

15:50.742 --> 15:52.743
We need a plan to get to the sensor.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.953
Well, I think I have an idea.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.413
Figure it out on the way!

16:06.257 --> 16:08.300
Okay, kid, quick! What's the plan?

16:09.010 --> 16:11.887
All right. Zeb, you and Hera,
out front laying cover fire.

16:12.221 --> 16:15.307
Sabine, you're on the ramp.
Kanan, you're with me.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.476
What am I doing on the ramp?

16:17.852 --> 16:20.020
Kanan and I are gonna
throw you over to the sensor.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.901
Times like these,
I really wish I had a jet-pack.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.747
-Ready?
-Yeah.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.459
One. Two. Three!

16:49.759 --> 16:51.218
-Sabine!
-No!

17:07.985 --> 17:09.611
Now, Chopper! Seal it up!

17:54.657 --> 17:56.324
Hera, get us ready to fly.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.665
Ezra! Let's get to work.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.797
That's it! We're clear!

18:10.882 --> 18:12.132
Get us outta here!

18:33.613 --> 18:35.280
Guess we should
inform Commander Sato

18:35.364 --> 18:37.741
our site might not work out.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.620
No. It took everything we had
just to find this place.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.538
I'm not ready to give it up.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.291
We're not going to.
The Rebellion needs this base

18:46.375 --> 18:48.543
and we're gonna do
whatever it takes to keep it.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.796
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.143
I think your fence is gonna hold.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.395
You'd better go talk to Hera.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.609
Why? What's wrong?

19:15.279 --> 19:17.113
Kanan, wake up!

19:17.198 --> 19:18.990
She might agree with your mission,

19:19.408 --> 19:22.911
but you're still walking out
and taking Ezra with you.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.001
Hera...

19:30.503 --> 19:32.212
I told the Commander the site is secure,

19:32.296 --> 19:34.047
and operations can resume.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.133
We're gonna be okay.
You know that, right?

19:37.718 --> 19:39.970
You realize I know
when you're lying, right?

19:42.598 --> 19:44.224
Whatever you're facing,

19:44.308 --> 19:46.184
I wanted us to face it together.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.687
We'll see each other again.

19:49.730 --> 19:50.856
I promise.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.648
Fine. I guess we won't be friends.

20:45.995 --> 20:46.995
Ahsoka?

20:47.997 --> 20:50.248
I see the base is coming along nicely.

20:50.333 --> 20:53.293
Yeah. These creatures
almost ruined it though.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.087
No matter what I do,
I can't seem to connect with them.

21:04.305 --> 21:08.058
ln my experience, just when
you think you understand the Force,

21:08.392 --> 21:10.644
you find out
how little you actually know.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.940
I don't think I ever
understood the Force to begin with.

21:16.359 --> 21:17.859
We should get going.
