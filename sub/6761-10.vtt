01:51.861 --> 01:53.779
Where is winter already?

01:53.863 --> 01:55.948
- Who needs winter?
- Me.

01:56.032 --> 01:58.951
I need a season I can sulk
and be depressed in.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.037
Don't tell me. You're babysitting tonight

02:01.120 --> 02:03.998
<i>and every video store
was out of Dirty Dancing.</i>

02:04.915 --> 02:07.960
Do you know I had to go
to three different places to find it?

02:08.044 --> 02:10.378
You must have it memorized by now.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.757
Well, whatever gets
you through the night, right?

02:12.840 --> 02:15.259
I mean, isn't that what you always say?

02:18.471 --> 02:20.598
That's what I always say.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.644
- Hi. I didn't see you.
- I saw you.

02:26.020 --> 02:29.523
- Brenda! Telephone!
- Excuse me.

02:29.982 --> 02:32.610
Probably a very important political call.

02:40.492 --> 02:42.661
Mrs Ross doesn't need you
to babysit tonight.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.581
- Katie has the chicken pox.
- I gotta call Kelly.

02:48.917 --> 02:51.086
- You rang?
- All right, I'll do it.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.046
I'll go out with your dweeb cousin.

02:53.130 --> 02:55.174
It's okay. I convinced Donna to go.

02:55.257 --> 02:56.967
<i>Fine, whatever you want.</i>

02:57.551 --> 02:59.052
- You wanna come over?
- No.

02:59.136 --> 03:01.930
I think I'm just gonna stay home
and sort my socks.

03:02.014 --> 03:05.100
<i>Brenda, you don't sound good.
You need a bubble bath.</i>

03:08.270 --> 03:10.272
Yeah, well, that's not all I need.

03:11.899 --> 03:13.066
Bye.

03:21.491 --> 03:24.077
Hey, Dad,
check out what we did to the car.

03:30.751 --> 03:32.753
So, where did you learn
to work on cars?

03:32.836 --> 03:35.213
From working on cars.
Same as Brandon.

03:35.297 --> 03:40.468
- Brandon tells me you have a Porsche.
- Now that is a happening car.

03:40.802 --> 03:43.763
You bought it from
your paper route earnings?

03:44.014 --> 03:46.349
Something like that, yeah.

03:48.226 --> 03:50.228
Mr Walsh, would it be okay if

03:50.312 --> 03:52.939
I cleaned up a little bit,
maybe took a shower?

03:53.189 --> 03:57.027
Certainly. Tell me something,
do you take this thing off first?

03:57.110 --> 03:58.361
In the shower?

03:58.778 --> 04:00.947
Depends on the circumstances, sir.

04:10.373 --> 04:12.709
Brandon! Can't you ever shut the door?

04:12.792 --> 04:15.336
I mean, it's hot enough in here already!

04:18.839 --> 04:23.011
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

04:29.767 --> 04:32.729
You keep popping up on me today.

04:35.023 --> 04:38.901
So, you were saying,
you're into videotape, huh?

04:39.944 --> 04:41.487
Yeah, I like movies.

04:41.988 --> 04:43.948
<i>You ever see Animal Crackers?</i>

04:44.240 --> 04:46.159
You know, Marx Brothers?

04:46.659 --> 04:48.411
I think so, on TV.

04:48.494 --> 04:51.038
Oh, it's so much better
on the big screen.

04:52.790 --> 04:56.502
It's too bad you're on duty tonight,
or you could see what I mean.

04:56.586 --> 04:59.881
Well, actually, my plans got poxed.

05:01.007 --> 05:04.510
- You wanna come along?
- Yeah.

05:18.315 --> 05:19.525
Hi, Dylan.

05:20.317 --> 05:23.320
Hey, how you been?

05:24.238 --> 05:25.573
Great.

05:28.617 --> 05:29.994
Friend of yours?

05:30.077 --> 05:31.996
Well, we used to hang out a little bit,
you know.

05:32.079 --> 05:35.291
I would have introduced you guys,
but I forgot her name.

05:35.374 --> 05:36.750
Nice.

05:37.084 --> 05:38.168
Wait, it's not my fault!

05:38.252 --> 05:41.547
She keeps changing it,
to things like "Tanya," or "Blue,"

05:41.630 --> 05:44.008
'cause her real name
is something like, Gertrude,

05:44.091 --> 05:47.386
or Beatrice or Brenda...

05:52.182 --> 05:55.728
- That's a mean right hook.
- Who do you think she practices on?

05:59.857 --> 06:01.650
This sound system is incredible.

06:01.733 --> 06:03.193
I mean, it's like it's alive.

06:03.277 --> 06:05.571
Yeah, you don't just hear it.
You can feel it.

06:05.654 --> 06:07.823
- Subwoofers, right?
- You got it.

06:09.366 --> 06:10.450
Foodage.

06:10.534 --> 06:13.161
Brandon, thanks for letting me
come with you guys.

06:13.245 --> 06:16.331
Well, if you play your cards right,
maybe we'll let you come with us again.

06:16.415 --> 06:19.459
- What do you think, McKay?
- Absolutely.

06:19.835 --> 06:21.378
Absolutely. 100%.

06:21.503 --> 06:22.838
It's a must.

06:23.547 --> 06:26.967
- Food. Food.
- All right, here it is, dig in.

06:33.014 --> 06:36.309
- These fries are just like at the hotel.
- 'Cause they are from the hotel.

06:36.393 --> 06:38.145
Ever since Dad closed the suite,

06:38.228 --> 06:41.356
Henry sends them to me
because he knows I need my fix.

06:41.648 --> 06:44.234
- He gave up the suite? What happened?
- It's a long story.

06:44.317 --> 06:46.528
- Hey, pick one. It's your turn.
- All right. Okay!

06:46.611 --> 06:48.613
What about that?

06:49.906 --> 06:51.575
- Okay.
- Okay, this?

06:51.658 --> 06:52.909
What is it?

06:53.368 --> 06:55.912
- No. No. Come on.
- Why?

07:06.423 --> 07:08.383
It's not like it was a date or anything.

07:08.466 --> 07:10.301
I mean, I was just tagging along.

07:10.385 --> 07:13.096
Dylan McKay doesn't waste his time
on just anybody.

07:13.179 --> 07:15.181
He's known as a man of action.

07:15.473 --> 07:18.184
Well, I swear, it was just a friend thing.

07:18.476 --> 07:20.812
I mean, I'm not even his type.

07:20.937 --> 07:22.438
We can work on that.

07:22.856 --> 07:25.733
Let's work on getting me out
of health class this semester.

07:25.817 --> 07:27.485
Everybody has to suffer through it.

07:27.569 --> 07:29.320
You can't graduate without it.

07:29.404 --> 07:31.364
Have you gotten
to the sex education part yet?

07:31.447 --> 07:32.782
Two weeks.

07:32.865 --> 07:36.411
It's a riot to watch all the little boys
counting down the days.

07:36.494 --> 07:37.704
Excuse me.

07:38.329 --> 07:40.623
Don't tell me Steve is in your class.

07:40.707 --> 07:43.126
Yeah, he's worked his way
through the freshman girls.

07:43.209 --> 07:45.503
I think he's on to the sophomores now.

07:45.586 --> 07:47.422
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:53.344 --> 07:55.930
Why does this class have to be co-ed?

07:56.347 --> 07:59.892
- It's much better this way.
- Why?

08:00.393 --> 08:03.855
Because when they start talking
about sex things with guys around,

08:03.938 --> 08:05.314
it gets them in the mood.

08:05.398 --> 08:09.527
David, Scott,
pass these out for me, please?

08:10.736 --> 08:13.447
- Are we taking a quiz?
- It's just a consent form.

08:13.531 --> 08:16.784
You can't participate
in the sex education seminars

08:16.867 --> 08:18.828
without your parents' okay.

08:19.996 --> 08:22.915
Did you ever notice that whenever
the subject turns towards sex,

08:22.998 --> 08:25.543
Mr Kravitz starts playing with his beard?

08:36.470 --> 08:38.097
- Bless you.
- Bless you.

08:39.431 --> 08:41.140
I hope you feel better.

08:41.683 --> 08:43.309
Hey, come on, it'll be fun.

08:43.686 --> 08:46.605
You could be the nurse
and Dylan could be the orderly.

08:47.231 --> 08:50.276
- Thanks, Mom.
- You don't want us to get sick, do you?

08:51.568 --> 08:54.071
Oh, here he is.
Okay, bye, guys. I love you.

08:54.154 --> 08:56.573
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:57.324 --> 08:59.118
Wait a minute,
she's going out alone with that guy?

08:59.201 --> 09:02.204
- Apparently.
- Terrific!

09:07.042 --> 09:10.671
- I take it you're not pleased.
- That's an understatement.

09:10.879 --> 09:13.966
His father is known in financial circles
as an unethical bastard,

09:14.049 --> 09:16.093
and that's putting it politely.

09:16.426 --> 09:18.178
But why judge Dylan by his father?

09:18.262 --> 09:21.640
In my experience,
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

09:28.730 --> 09:30.315
What about them?

09:30.816 --> 09:33.235
That's a pick-up if I ever saw one.

09:33.318 --> 09:35.570
- How can you tell?
- Body language.

09:35.654 --> 09:39.157
He's available,
she's open to suggestion.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.411
You know a lot about this stuff.

09:42.494 --> 09:47.124
- What stuff?
- You know, people, couples stuff.

09:47.582 --> 09:50.293
- Don't you?
- I don't know.

09:50.961 --> 09:52.128
Not really.

09:53.255 --> 09:55.507
What say we shine on this movie?

09:56.550 --> 09:58.260
What'd you have in mind?

10:01.930 --> 10:04.891
Paul, I have told you before,
that this is not good enough.

10:04.975 --> 10:06.351
Now, I am not gonna tell you again,

10:06.434 --> 10:09.646
you fix that or you're gonna find
another place to work.

10:10.980 --> 10:13.441
- Dad.
- Dylan!

10:14.359 --> 10:16.361
When did you get back in town?

10:17.487 --> 10:19.114
I need to talk to you.

10:26.663 --> 10:30.667
I asked you to do a few simple things
of vital importance to me.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.168
Vital importance?

10:32.252 --> 10:33.878
Yes, is that too much to ask?

10:33.962 --> 10:36.756
I went to that bar and I sat there
for hours with those dudes.

10:36.839 --> 10:39.050
You didn't even call me.
Where were you?

10:39.133 --> 10:42.095
Did it ever occur to you
that I might be tied up?

10:42.178 --> 10:45.598
The whole world, Dylan,
does not revolve around Dylan McKay.

10:45.682 --> 10:47.350
Did it ever?

10:50.520 --> 10:53.689
- You don't drink, do you?
- Only at family reunions.

10:53.773 --> 10:56.150
Come on, don't.
You're driving me home.

10:57.527 --> 10:59.570
Come on. Let's get out of here.

11:06.786 --> 11:08.579
You don't have to talk
about it if you don't want to.

11:08.663 --> 11:09.956
- Good.
- Look, do you wanna

11:10.039 --> 11:11.165
take a walk on the beach or something?

11:11.249 --> 11:13.251
Yeah. Check out the homeless people.
That'd be great.

11:13.334 --> 11:14.627
Dylan,
I don't know what happened up there.

11:14.710 --> 11:16.045
That's right, you don't!

11:16.128 --> 11:17.755
- If you'd let me finish...
- Excuse me.

11:17.838 --> 11:19.423
I have a knack for interrupting things.

11:19.507 --> 11:21.133
- Dylan...
- I'm real good at interrupting things

11:21.217 --> 11:23.552
and I've had just about enough
noise for one night, okay?

11:23.636 --> 11:25.971
- Excuse me. Can you get me a taxi?
- Forget the taxi!

11:26.055 --> 11:28.974
- No, I want a taxi!
- No! Just come on, damn it!

11:29.058 --> 11:30.559
Stop yelling at me!

11:35.940 --> 11:39.235
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Just let me go.

11:39.318 --> 11:41.153
Brenda, I'm an idiot. Please don't leave.

11:41.237 --> 11:43.072
You're scaring me.

11:44.365 --> 11:45.824
I'm sorry.

11:49.036 --> 11:52.706
- Dylan, what happened?
- He just gets to me.

11:52.957 --> 11:54.833
He always gets to me.

11:54.917 --> 11:57.336
I don't know what I'm supposed to...

12:02.007 --> 12:03.842
It's okay.

12:38.710 --> 12:42.631
So, after he kicked me out,
we didn't talk for about a year.

12:42.798 --> 12:46.009
It's better now, but it's still no picnic.

12:46.176 --> 12:48.720
I can't imagine being cut off like that.

12:49.221 --> 12:51.556
I mean, I tell my parents everything.

12:53.183 --> 12:57.395
- Everything?
- Well, not everything.

13:00.190 --> 13:03.652
Bren, don't tell Brandon
I lost my cool, okay?

13:04.152 --> 13:05.403
I won't.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.700
I wouldn't.

13:13.870 --> 13:17.666
So, are you sorry we missed the movie?

13:18.833 --> 13:20.293
Oh, yeah.

13:40.813 --> 13:43.107
I mean, it's not like we're
going steady or anything.

13:43.191 --> 13:45.985
Brenda, you had a date,
and he asked you out again.

13:46.069 --> 13:48.071
That's dating. That's plural.

13:48.154 --> 13:50.657
Oh, so what's next?

13:50.740 --> 13:54.786
- Do I get pinned or something?
- Yeah, preferably to the mattress.

13:54.869 --> 13:56.120
Kelly!

13:56.537 --> 13:58.915
You know, it's a good thing
you're coming over to study tonight.

13:58.998 --> 14:01.375
I can see we have a lot of work to do.

14:01.751 --> 14:02.919
Sorry.

14:03.669 --> 14:04.879
I can't wait.

14:05.046 --> 14:08.299
Consent forms, people. I need them.

14:08.382 --> 14:11.260
You need them. They're required.

14:11.802 --> 14:15.014
- My mom's never gonna sign that form.
- Why not?

14:15.097 --> 14:18.851
She... She thinks I'll be getting
the wrong kind of message at school.

14:18.935 --> 14:20.728
Well, what kind of message
are you getting at home?

14:20.811 --> 14:22.396
Your mom has six kids.

14:27.652 --> 14:29.195
There he goes.

14:29.862 --> 14:31.656
- He's playing with his beard again.
- Yeah.

14:31.739 --> 14:34.658
Mr K, a penny for your thoughts?

14:40.748 --> 14:43.292
- Dylan. How's it going?
- Getting by.

14:45.002 --> 14:47.338
- How's the cold?
- Better, thanks.

14:47.463 --> 14:50.132
- So, how was the movie?
- We didn't make the movie.

14:50.216 --> 14:52.927
- Hi.
- Brenda, hi.

14:53.552 --> 14:56.055
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't go to the movie?

14:56.138 --> 14:57.389
What movie?

14:58.766 --> 15:01.852
Oh, that movie. Right.

15:02.144 --> 15:04.980
- That supposed to be funny?
- Sorry.

15:05.481 --> 15:09.943
- It's no big deal, is it?
- No, no, I guess not.

15:11.320 --> 15:14.656
- See you later, Brandon.
- Catch you later.

15:20.621 --> 15:22.831
So Shelley and Paul went to this spa,

15:22.915 --> 15:25.459
they spent two days soaking
in herbal mud,

15:25.542 --> 15:27.711
and ended up completely potatoed.

15:27.878 --> 15:32.341
"Potatoed?" As in what?
Baked? Mashed? Fried?

15:32.424 --> 15:33.842
How about relaxed?

15:33.926 --> 15:36.303
As in ready to face the world
on Monday morning?

15:36.386 --> 15:38.639
Oh, hey, come on,
you should do it, Dad.

15:38.722 --> 15:40.098
Definitely.

15:40.223 --> 15:41.683
I mean, Brandon's
working this weekend,

15:41.767 --> 15:43.393
I have plans, you guys should just go.

15:43.477 --> 15:44.978
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

15:45.187 --> 15:47.397
I mean,
what are your plans this weekend?

15:47.481 --> 15:51.902
I'm probably going out Friday night,
to a movie or something.

15:52.277 --> 15:54.613
- With whom?
- Dylan.

16:00.869 --> 16:02.621
Is there a problem?

16:03.246 --> 16:06.541
I really don't want you getting
involved with him, honey.

16:07.375 --> 16:10.003
Well, it's a little too late for that, Dad.

16:10.295 --> 16:12.714
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

16:12.797 --> 16:15.508
I mean I don't want you dating him.
Period.

16:15.926 --> 16:17.719
Jump in any time, Brandon.

16:18.887 --> 16:21.931
- Well...
- He has nothing to say about this.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.601
Oh, I see. Okay.

16:25.393 --> 16:27.937
Well, I'll make plans with Kelly instead.

16:29.147 --> 16:32.525
Thanks for dinner. It's been real.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.662
I have a right to my opinion.

16:44.913 --> 16:48.166
- And I have the right to mine.
- Which is?

16:49.751 --> 16:51.127
I like Dylan.

16:54.922 --> 16:56.924
You want to do us all a favor?

16:57.425 --> 16:59.093
Tell your friend to watch his step.

16:59.177 --> 17:01.929
- Dad, I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

17:02.013 --> 17:04.307
Unless you want me to.

17:12.940 --> 17:14.275
Brenda.

17:18.529 --> 17:21.531
Didn't you say there was something
you needed me to sign for school?

17:21.616 --> 17:24.911
Oh, yeah, thanks for reminding me.

17:30.958 --> 17:34.295
Is this course as outmoded
as it was when I was in school?

17:34.837 --> 17:36.088
I don't know.

17:36.797 --> 17:39.842
We haven't gotten up
to the sex chapter yet.

17:41.552 --> 17:44.930
This book looks pretty thorough.

17:45.848 --> 17:48.559
It doesn't deal with
the most important stuff.

17:49.059 --> 17:50.394
Like what?

17:51.729 --> 17:55.107
Like, how it feels, in your heart,

17:55.858 --> 17:58.652
when you really want
to connect with someone.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.948
When it's the right time,

18:03.616 --> 18:05.576
and it's the right person,

18:06.410 --> 18:07.953
it feels wonderful.

18:13.417 --> 18:15.919
And you don't think Dylan's
the right person either?

18:16.003 --> 18:19.590
Brenda, there are so many things
that go into a relationship.

18:19.673 --> 18:23.969
There's mutual respect
and commitment

18:26.638 --> 18:29.141
and if that connection is meaningful,

18:30.726 --> 18:33.187
it doesn't have to be about sex.

18:35.647 --> 18:38.358
I hate to break this to you, Mom,

18:39.192 --> 18:41.904
but it definitely has something
to do with it.

18:43.238 --> 18:46.575
That's Kelly.
I'm going over to her house to study.

18:54.541 --> 18:55.751
Bye, Mom.

18:59.045 --> 19:02.090
- Why didn't you stick up for me?
- What was I supposed to say?

19:02.174 --> 19:05.427
- He's a Boy Scout?
- You could have said something.

19:10.265 --> 19:13.226
It's like they're all in this conspiracy
to take away the most exciting

19:13.310 --> 19:15.854
and best thing that's happened
to me since I moved here.

19:15.937 --> 19:19.899
That's why you're keeping your date
with Dylan and sleeping at my house.

19:19.983 --> 19:21.776
This is going so fast.

19:22.068 --> 19:25.989
And we're just talking about it.
Wait till you get to the real thing.

19:26.156 --> 19:30.035
I guess I'm more into the romancing,
like in the movies.

19:30.660 --> 19:34.873
That's all well and good for the movies,
but you do have protection, right?

19:37.292 --> 19:41.045
- Well, no.
- Open that drawer.

19:43.006 --> 19:45.091
Basic rule number one,

19:45.508 --> 19:48.344
never rely on the guy. Memorize that.

19:48.553 --> 19:50.430
You sound so clinical.

19:50.638 --> 19:53.641
Dear, clinical is, "What time shall
we schedule the procedure?"

19:53.725 --> 19:55.226
Kelly, that's awful.

19:55.810 --> 19:58.104
Would you rather sit around
thinking up names?

19:58.187 --> 20:00.648
How about Dylan Junior? Or Brendina?

20:01.149 --> 20:02.817
All right, I'll take them.

20:02.900 --> 20:05.528
This is not the part I want to think about.

20:05.820 --> 20:09.157
Brenda, if things go well,
you won't be thinking at all.

20:19.292 --> 20:20.668
No!

20:21.043 --> 20:22.587
Eat it!

20:27.341 --> 20:28.801
No! No!

20:46.777 --> 20:51.949
I know it's Friday, but if you could just
bear with me for a few more minutes.

20:52.867 --> 20:54.326
Settling down.

20:55.911 --> 20:58.873
Now, those of you who haven't
turned in your consent forms

20:58.956 --> 21:01.792
will not be able to attend
next week's special assembly.

21:01.876 --> 21:03.252
- So...
- Mr K.

21:03.335 --> 21:05.337
Is that that special, special assembly?

21:05.421 --> 21:07.464
Where that sex expert's coming?

21:08.632 --> 21:11.677
That's very funny, Steve, I was just
getting to that.

21:12.177 --> 21:14.638
We are fortunate
to have Miss Stacy Sloan

21:14.722 --> 21:16.265
coming to address the student body.

21:16.348 --> 21:19.601
Did you say,
"undress the student body?" I'm there.

21:21.145 --> 21:23.564
You didn't get your mom
to sign the form?

21:23.647 --> 21:27.276
I... I don't want to talk about it.

21:30.988 --> 21:32.573
Hey, Dylan! Where you going so fast?

21:32.656 --> 21:33.991
I gotta be someplace. What's up?

21:34.074 --> 21:36.201
I was hoping you could help me work
on my car this weekend.

21:36.285 --> 21:39.705
Look, I'd like to, but my old man
got back in town, and he's got...

21:39.788 --> 21:41.206
It's a long story.

21:43.250 --> 21:45.627
- You don't have time to tell me about it?
- Not really.

21:45.711 --> 21:48.213
But you do have time to make out
with my sister.

21:48.297 --> 21:49.631
Or is that just until next month,

21:49.715 --> 21:51.466
when suddenly you won't have time
for her either?

21:51.550 --> 21:52.718
What's your point?

21:52.801 --> 21:55.178
My point is you better really like her.

21:55.512 --> 21:57.806
She's very romantic
and dreamy and sweet,

21:57.889 --> 22:00.308
and she's not gonna move
on that easily.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.185
Dylan, she's a virgin.

22:02.269 --> 22:04.563
What kind of jerk do you think I am?

22:05.313 --> 22:07.023
Have a nice weekend.

23:03.621 --> 23:04.914
Here, give me the brush.

23:04.998 --> 23:08.209
- Okay, okay, don't I need earrings?
- No.

23:08.293 --> 23:09.752
- What else do I need?
- Shoes.

23:09.836 --> 23:11.671
Shoes, shoes, shoes.

23:11.754 --> 23:13.089
- This one.
- Okay.

23:13.172 --> 23:16.134
Here's the other one. Good.

23:16.384 --> 23:20.888
- And, take my purse.
- Okay, thanks.

23:21.097 --> 23:22.348
- Okay, okay.
- It looks good.

23:22.432 --> 23:23.724
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

23:23.808 --> 23:27.395
- Yeah? What do you think?
- It's perfect. It's perfect.

23:28.020 --> 23:29.605
Okay.

23:30.648 --> 23:33.234
Come on, we'll drop you off
at the theatre.

23:37.863 --> 23:39.282
- Bye.
- Bye.

23:39.365 --> 23:40.908
- Bye.
- Bye.

24:17.403 --> 24:19.280
Hi. Has it started yet?

24:19.655 --> 24:20.948
Thanks.

24:57.609 --> 24:58.652
Brenda.

25:07.452 --> 25:08.870
You want to talk?

25:10.580 --> 25:14.918
I've been talking to Kelly all night
and it didn't get me anywhere.

25:16.503 --> 25:18.839
Well, I'm open for the morning shift.

25:29.975 --> 25:31.810
He didn't show up, Brandon.

25:34.062 --> 25:38.566
I was ready to spend the night with him,
and he didn't show up.

25:42.445 --> 25:45.198
- What a jerk, huh?
- He sure can be.

25:45.281 --> 25:48.910
Not him, me! I thought I was special.

25:49.160 --> 25:52.497
- You are.
- Well, not to him, obviously.

25:55.667 --> 25:57.752
And then finally I call him.

25:58.586 --> 26:01.798
And this man told me he was there,
but he wouldn't speak to me.

26:01.881 --> 26:05.718
Brenda, you can't beat yourself up
over someone like him.

26:06.261 --> 26:08.471
- Why do you say that?
- I don't know.

26:09.681 --> 26:12.433
I thought he was different,
but he doesn't let people in.

26:12.517 --> 26:15.061
I don't understand, Brandon.

26:16.396 --> 26:18.147
We were so there.

26:18.231 --> 26:21.984
Even yesterday out on the lawn,
we were together, we were in sync.

26:22.777 --> 26:24.487
I was so happy.

26:26.072 --> 26:29.492
I don't know what happened,
but something happened.

26:30.576 --> 26:32.662
I'm really sorry, Bren.

26:32.745 --> 26:35.498
I have to find out what I did wrong.

26:36.749 --> 26:38.876
I need to know what happened.

26:48.260 --> 26:50.096
Been busy lately, Dylan?

26:50.179 --> 26:53.599
Well, if it isn't the master of tact
and diplomacy.

26:53.891 --> 26:56.060
What's going on with you, man?

26:56.435 --> 26:58.437
I know you moved.
I went to your old house.

26:58.521 --> 27:00.314
They said you didn't even leave
a forwarding address.

27:00.398 --> 27:02.149
It's a long story.

27:05.236 --> 27:06.612
Would you rather tell it to Brenda?

27:06.695 --> 27:08.531
Brandon, don't start that with me,
all right?

27:08.614 --> 27:10.616
I got the message!
You don't want me to hurt your sister.

27:10.699 --> 27:14.995
Then why is that exactly what you did?
Just to spite me?

27:17.122 --> 27:19.708
Look, it wasn't because of you, okay?

27:19.792 --> 27:22.211
You gotta believe me.
Something came up, that's all.

27:22.294 --> 27:25.047
Dylan, it's one thing not to talk to me.
I'm not gonna cry about it.

27:25.130 --> 27:28.175
But when you do it to her,
she feels like she did something wrong.

27:28.258 --> 27:31.220
It wasn't her,
it had nothing to do with her!

27:31.303 --> 27:32.805
Then why don't you tell her that!

27:32.888 --> 27:35.057
Would you guys hold it down there.

27:35.224 --> 27:36.392
She was so upset all weekend,

27:36.475 --> 27:38.852
she even stayed home
from school today.

27:43.857 --> 27:48.070
Fine, it's got nothing to do with her,
it's got nothing to do with me.

27:48.153 --> 27:50.864
Meanwhile, you're not talking
to either of us.

27:50.948 --> 27:52.282
Makes a lot of sense.

28:07.547 --> 28:10.258
- Good class today, Mr K!
- Thanks so much for telling me, Steve.

28:10.342 --> 28:12.427
- Now I can die happy.
- You need a lift?

28:12.511 --> 28:15.430
I've gotta wait for the damn tow truck.
I'm supposed to be at the airport

28:15.514 --> 28:17.766
to pick up this poor woman
in 20 minutes!

28:17.849 --> 28:20.268
Well, it's not a problem. What airline?

28:21.812 --> 28:25.148
Steve, this is the guest speaker
for our assembly.

28:25.315 --> 28:26.858
So? Does she bite?

28:27.025 --> 28:31.071
Look, I'd be glad to help,
but if you'd rather wait for a tow truck...

28:32.364 --> 28:36.910
Palm West Air from Chicago.
Stacy Sloan. Bel Age Hotel.

28:36.993 --> 28:40.664
- Don't screw this up.
- You'll owe me.

28:52.300 --> 28:54.344
Thanks so much for everything,
Mr Kravitz.

28:54.427 --> 28:58.473
Oh, it's no trouble.
We at West Beverly aim to please.

28:58.556 --> 29:01.226
And please, call me Fred.

29:02.185 --> 29:06.439
I can't believe you've been teaching
there for five years. You look so young.

29:08.399 --> 29:12.070
Did I say five? I mean three.
Three years.

29:12.362 --> 29:14.864
The assembly starts
at 1:00 tomorrow, right?

29:14.948 --> 29:16.157
Right.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.201
I'm due to speak at Beverly High School
in the morning,

29:18.284 --> 29:20.078
but I should be done by noon.

29:20.161 --> 29:23.247
Those lucky dogs,
they get you when you're fresh.

29:24.665 --> 29:27.668
It is draining,
but I'm feeling pretty good these days,

29:27.752 --> 29:30.546
so I should be fine.

29:30.630 --> 29:33.508
Well, great,
what time can I pick you up tonight?

29:35.468 --> 29:40.097
Like I said, I'm just going to take it easy.

29:40.431 --> 29:45.186
But you are very sweet
and very persistent.

29:45.353 --> 29:47.480
And you are the most
beautiful guest speaker

29:47.563 --> 29:49.565
we've ever had at West Beverly.

29:51.108 --> 29:53.527
I'm very flattered, really.

29:54.070 --> 29:58.574
But I'm tired. Maybe some other time.

30:42.576 --> 30:44.411
I'm not very good at this.

30:46.413 --> 30:49.708
- I feel terrible.
- You look terrible.

30:50.417 --> 30:53.295
- You look great.
- You must need glasses.

30:55.255 --> 30:56.507
Can I come in?

31:01.094 --> 31:02.387
I'm sorry.

31:03.597 --> 31:06.183
I know, you're an idiot.

31:07.935 --> 31:11.146
- That's not good enough this time.
- I don't know what to say.

31:11.229 --> 31:14.149
Oh, you don't? You are too much.

31:15.317 --> 31:17.819
You know, you don't tell me
where you were or what happened,

31:17.903 --> 31:20.155
but then you expect me to forgive you?

31:20.238 --> 31:21.698
Why don't you just go!

31:21.782 --> 31:25.577
You think I'm proud of myself? I'm not.

31:26.244 --> 31:28.789
I've just been trying to figure out
what to say to you.

31:28.872 --> 31:30.332
Then say it!

31:30.916 --> 31:32.501
Brandon told me you moved.

31:32.584 --> 31:33.710
You didn't even...

31:33.793 --> 31:37.214
I didn't even show up Friday night
because I had to help my father pack.

31:37.297 --> 31:38.798
He needed to disappear and...

31:38.882 --> 31:41.301
What do you mean? Where did he go?

31:41.593 --> 31:44.054
Out of the country for a little while.
I really don't know where.

31:44.137 --> 31:48.433
That way, if I'm subpoenaed,
I don't have anything to tell them.

31:48.516 --> 31:49.684
Subpoenaed?

31:49.768 --> 31:52.687
He found out he's gonna be indicted
on some charges.

31:52.771 --> 31:55.357
Not murders or anything,

31:56.107 --> 31:59.402
it's securities fraud, things like that.

32:03.948 --> 32:05.158
Dylan.

32:06.701 --> 32:09.496
I've been thinking about you
the whole time.

32:10.163 --> 32:13.625
I just had to go do this.
Please don't think that I didn't care.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.211
I did. I do.

32:19.130 --> 32:20.965
I wish you would've called.

32:21.466 --> 32:23.009
I just couldn't.

32:24.427 --> 32:26.512
- I called you.
- When?

32:26.721 --> 32:28.639
They... They didn't tell me.

32:33.186 --> 32:35.021
Now I feel terrible.

32:38.483 --> 32:41.611
I don't want to make
you feel terrible anymore.

32:43.446 --> 32:45.615
How do you want me to feel, Dylan?

32:46.449 --> 32:48.826
What do you want me to feel for you?

32:59.879 --> 33:01.922
You are so warm.

33:32.578 --> 33:33.829
It's my father.

33:34.872 --> 33:36.081
Jacket.

33:40.961 --> 33:43.172
- Dad, hi. You remember Dylan?
- Yeah, hi.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.174
- I was just leaving.
- Yeah.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.009
I'll tell Brandon you came by, right?

33:47.092 --> 33:48.594
- Okay.
- Bye.

33:49.386 --> 33:51.764
What kind of idiot do you take me for?

33:52.181 --> 33:54.641
Are you going to pretend that
he was just over here fixing cars?

33:54.725 --> 33:55.851
Why are you so upset?

33:55.934 --> 33:58.103
You want to learn about your pal there?

33:58.187 --> 34:00.856
His father's exploits would make
a great novel someday.

34:00.939 --> 34:02.816
Maybe he can write it from prison.

34:02.900 --> 34:05.485
- Was he arrested?
- Not yet.

34:05.569 --> 34:06.945
He skipped town.

34:07.446 --> 34:09.239
Great role model, huh? Some example.

34:09.322 --> 34:11.617
Dad, Dylan is nothing like his father.

34:11.699 --> 34:13.702
He's just trying to get by
like the rest of us.

34:13.784 --> 34:16.163
- You deserve better than that.
- Like who?

34:16.246 --> 34:17.831
Someone straighter?
Someone younger?

34:17.914 --> 34:19.541
- Quieter?
- For a start.

34:19.833 --> 34:23.920
Dad, those "nice" boys may
be mild-mannered on the outside,

34:24.045 --> 34:25.880
but mostly what they all
think about is sex.

34:25.964 --> 34:27.174
Who said anything about sex?

34:27.257 --> 34:30.927
I'm talking about a person's values.
I'm talking about their character.

34:31.011 --> 34:33.554
Are you really worried
about my character?

34:33.763 --> 34:35.849
Why is it with Brandon,
you just wanted to make sure

34:35.931 --> 34:37.058
he knew about birth control,

34:37.141 --> 34:39.351
but my whole value system
is on the line?

34:39.436 --> 34:42.147
Brenda, it is different with girls.
It just is.

34:42.230 --> 34:43.648
You need to know
who you're dealing with!

34:43.732 --> 34:45.065
Then let me get to know him!

34:45.150 --> 34:47.527
- That's all I want to do!
- Is that all?

34:48.027 --> 34:49.821
What do you want me to say?

34:49.904 --> 34:52.532
That I'm going to wait till I get married?

34:53.324 --> 34:55.909
You're so worried
and I haven't even done anything yet.

34:55.994 --> 34:58.747
I'm not worried.
I just don't know if I'm ready...

34:58.830 --> 35:00.790
I mean, if you're ready to...

35:01.958 --> 35:05.378
And if I'm ready first. Then what?

35:06.337 --> 35:08.339
Should I lie and sneak around?

35:09.174 --> 35:12.218
Or are you going to trust me
to know what I'm doing?

35:29.027 --> 35:32.071
<i>Health Expo Week ends today with
a special assembly after fifth period.</i>

35:32.155 --> 35:33.406
<i>Be there or be square.</i>

35:33.489 --> 35:35.950
I can't believe you actually
said that to your father.

35:36.034 --> 35:37.368
Neither can I.

35:37.452 --> 35:40.371
- But it just came out.
- What did he say?

35:40.455 --> 35:42.707
Well, it's not like
he gave me his blessing,

35:42.790 --> 35:45.293
but at least Dylan's
not totally off limits anymore.

35:45.376 --> 35:46.919
Well, that's cool.

35:48.337 --> 35:49.964
Don't be a wimp! Just come on!

35:50.047 --> 35:52.967
I have to report to study hall.

35:53.134 --> 35:54.802
Okay, fine. Check in,

35:55.052 --> 35:57.722
go to the bathroom, and then meet me
around at the front door.

35:57.805 --> 35:59.307
I'll get in trouble.

35:59.390 --> 36:02.435
Why? It's just information.
How's it gonna hurt you?

36:04.520 --> 36:06.522
Just take notes for me.

36:08.733 --> 36:10.943
Your mom really has you cowed.

36:14.613 --> 36:17.408
<i>Testing, one, two. Testing.</i>

36:17.616 --> 36:22.204
So, if you need help working on the car,
I could do it this weekend.

36:22.872 --> 36:24.957
It's all right. I can handle it.

36:26.542 --> 36:30.671
Somehow I am always apologizing
to you Walsh people.

36:32.840 --> 36:36.176
I'm sorry if it felt like
I checked out on you, man.

36:38.053 --> 36:40.639
I guess it bothered me more
than I thought.

36:41.974 --> 36:44.810
I'm sorry I opened
my big mouth about Brenda.

36:46.562 --> 36:49.064
Would you have felt better
if I had asked you first,

36:49.148 --> 36:51.150
about seeing her, I mean?

36:52.568 --> 36:56.405
- Are you saying you should have?
- You tell me.

36:57.364 --> 36:59.992
Not that I would've
done anything different.

37:22.848 --> 37:26.435
<i>Everybody, please. Hello, quiet, quiet.</i>

37:29.896 --> 37:34.484
<i>So please welcome our special
guest speaker, Stacy Sloan.</i>

37:39.823 --> 37:40.949
<i>Thank you.</i>

37:41.032 --> 37:43.743
<i>It's nice to come in
from the cold of Chicago.</i>

37:44.035 --> 37:47.914
Not bad, huh? Bel Age Hotel.
Room 316.

37:48.498 --> 37:50.792
I had an experience
just after I arrived here

37:50.875 --> 37:52.919
that I'd like to share with all of you.

37:53.003 --> 37:56.256
A young man wanted
to take me out on the town,

37:56.339 --> 37:59.342
show me around, get to know me better.

37:59.426 --> 38:01.970
Timing wasn't right, and I told him that.

38:02.053 --> 38:05.640
It was a shame, too.
He was very handsome.

38:06.349 --> 38:08.643
Had incredible blue eyes.

38:12.105 --> 38:14.691
What I didn't tell him is
what I'm going to have to tell

38:14.774 --> 38:18.027
every guy who's interested in me
for the rest of my life,

38:21.447 --> 38:22.991
that I have AIDS.

38:31.416 --> 38:32.667
What'd I miss?

38:32.917 --> 38:35.920
Now, you may think you already know
all you need to know about AIDS,

38:36.004 --> 38:38.506
and these good people
will make sure of that.

38:38.589 --> 38:42.176
They'll tell you how to get tested for it,
how you won't get it,

38:42.260 --> 38:46.931
like from hugging someone
or sharing their French fries,

38:47.140 --> 38:48.808
and how you can get it.

38:49.559 --> 38:53.771
I'm just here to tell you about one way,
the way I got it.

38:54.939 --> 38:56.440
I was 16,

38:57.191 --> 39:01.070
he was a law student at the university
where I went to summer school.

39:01.153 --> 39:05.157
One weekend he arranged a beautiful,
romantic evening for us,

39:05.241 --> 39:06.784
and we made love.

39:07.243 --> 39:08.828
It was my first time.

39:09.996 --> 39:12.999
After a while we found out we
really didn't have that much in common

39:13.082 --> 39:15.334
and we went our separate ways.

39:16.419 --> 39:19.922
He died last year... of AIDS.

39:26.137 --> 39:27.346
It's...

39:28.514 --> 39:31.267
It's funny how your battles change.

39:31.350 --> 39:34.228
I used to struggle
to stay fashionably thin.

39:34.311 --> 39:37.189
Now, some days I'm lucky
if I can keep any food down.

39:37.273 --> 39:41.735
And I used to fight with my sister
over who'd get to stay up later,

39:41.902 --> 39:45.364
and now she's always yelling at me
to get enough rest.

39:46.198 --> 39:50.160
I try not to dwell on the grim statistics,
and they are indeed grim.

39:50.536 --> 39:52.788
But, I'm a fighter,

39:53.205 --> 39:56.792
and a talker, and I will go on fighting

39:56.875 --> 40:00.379
as long as I have something
to say to people like you.

40:00.462 --> 40:01.880
Which is this,

40:02.297 --> 40:05.384
you shouldn't have sex
because of what your friends will think,

40:05.467 --> 40:08.554
or because you drink
too much one night.

40:09.012 --> 40:12.850
And if you're in love
and you're going to have sex,

40:13.600 --> 40:17.604
make sure you use a condom and foam.

40:20.274 --> 40:24.069
And know that the only really safe way
to have intercourse

40:24.152 --> 40:27.364
is with someone you are sure
who hasn't been exposed.

40:34.162 --> 40:35.914
I'll be around later for questions,

40:35.997 --> 40:39.292
but that's about all I can do
for right now.

41:03.984 --> 41:06.611
Hope I didn't get you
into too much hot water.

41:06.695 --> 41:09.114
No, I can do that all by myself.

41:10.490 --> 41:11.658
Stacy,

41:14.536 --> 41:15.662
I'm sorry.

41:18.248 --> 41:19.916
I hope I didn't...

41:21.793 --> 41:24.045
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

41:24.504 --> 41:27.048
Tell me you heard what I was trying
to get across here today,

41:27.131 --> 41:30.510
- and I'll go home happy.
- I did.

41:32.845 --> 41:37.725
And my offer for dinner's still open
next time you're in town.

42:00.540 --> 42:02.291
Oh, hi, Dylan, come on in.

42:05.169 --> 42:08.464
I'll see if Brenda's ready.
Dear, Dylan's here.

42:13.302 --> 42:15.304
- How are you holding up?
- Okay.

42:16.013 --> 42:19.433
I just don't talk to the press much.

42:21.435 --> 42:24.980
Mr Walsh, I've never felt comfortable

42:25.064 --> 42:27.566
being known as Jack McKay's son,

42:28.859 --> 42:33.781
particularly since I hardly know the man.

42:35.699 --> 42:37.910
It's a shame it has to be that way.

42:38.327 --> 42:41.705
Brandon and Brenda are very lucky
to have parents like you.

42:46.627 --> 42:48.170
Night, Dad.

42:48.796 --> 42:50.965
- You take good care, now.
- Okay.

43:05.896 --> 43:09.942
This place is beautiful, very impressive.

43:10.025 --> 43:12.027
Well, I'm an impressive guy.

43:12.444 --> 43:13.779
What I want to know is,

43:13.862 --> 43:17.115
how many times have you come
up here with other girls?

43:17.282 --> 43:19.243
You don't like the view?

43:20.619 --> 43:22.079
I love the view.

43:31.213 --> 43:35.300
Why is it when I'm with you
I can just forget about everything?

43:37.594 --> 43:39.805
Dylan, I have to ask you something.

43:43.016 --> 43:44.309
Ask away.

43:46.436 --> 43:49.481
- Don't get mad, okay?
- I never get mad.

43:53.276 --> 43:56.154
Have you ever had sex
when you weren't protected?

43:56.530 --> 43:57.989
Not lately.

44:00.116 --> 44:01.493
But did you ever?

44:04.829 --> 44:06.081
Yeah.

44:11.211 --> 44:13.046
Are you worried about that?

44:16.007 --> 44:18.718
Well, I'm assuming
that you want to with me.

44:20.553 --> 44:24.557
Am I totally blowing this?
Am I thinking too much?

44:24.641 --> 44:27.060
Brenda, I love it that you think.

44:28.102 --> 44:29.771
Not a lot of people do.

44:32.982 --> 44:35.777
So, what are you saying?

44:35.860 --> 44:38.279
Do you want me to get a test?

44:40.531 --> 44:42.283
You would do that for me?

44:44.202 --> 44:46.579
I guess I'd be doing it for me.

45:03.012 --> 45:04.430
Are you all right?

45:08.559 --> 45:10.895
Dylan, I need us to slow down.

45:11.979 --> 45:15.441
- I'm scared.
- Of what? Of me?

45:18.527 --> 45:23.991
I'm not used to these feelings,
and I want to be sure.

45:26.035 --> 45:27.953
And I'm afraid you'll say no.

45:28.412 --> 45:30.998
I didn't say no.

45:32.416 --> 45:33.751
You didn't?

45:34.960 --> 45:38.047
No, I didn't.

45:40.758 --> 45:43.928
No, you didn't.
