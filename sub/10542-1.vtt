02:48.701 --> 02:50.168
What the fuck?

03:33.146 --> 03:35.114
Tell me something, Roger.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.441
Set your watch back.
There's a time difference.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.712
We're landing in Los Angeles.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.545
It's a city in California.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.522
Anything else you want to know?

03:52.064 --> 03:53.827
You all right, Bryan?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.566
You on edge? Want a Valium? Lude?

03:58.004 --> 03:59.028
Gum?

04:05.578 --> 04:07.842
I used to live here, didn't l?

04:18.057 --> 04:19.786
What did he call it?

04:20.259 --> 04:21.851
A talking tomato?

04:22.762 --> 04:25.322
It's a fucking extraterrestrial, Ron.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.659
So you're telling me
that he's not gonna sign off

04:28.768 --> 04:31.202
until we redesign the talking tomato?

04:31.304 --> 04:34.569
Well, that's bullshit.
Ron, listen, listen to me.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.335
Let me inform you of something, okay?

04:38.544 --> 04:41.877
We don't let 25- year- olds
tell us how to make movies.

04:50.823 --> 04:53.314
Listen, I gotta go. I gotta go, Ron.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.388
Just call... Ron, call me later, okay?

05:17.583 --> 05:21.246
Fast- acting Power Soap really gets in
and blasts stains,

05:21.354 --> 05:23.754
Ieaving your whole wash fresh and clean,

05:23.856 --> 05:26.950
with a brightness
that people will really notice.

05:27.059 --> 05:28.754
Wow! That's incredible.

05:28.861 --> 05:32.592
I thought that ketchup stain
would never come out of Joe's polo shirt.

05:32.698 --> 05:36.498
Whites simply come out whiter
and colors simply come out brighter.

05:36.602 --> 05:41.062
It's the kind of clean that people
will really notice and talk about.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.071
How did you lift those coffee stains?

05:43.175 --> 05:46.667
I thought I was gonna have
to throw my new pantsuit out.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.775
I blasted it out with Power Soap!

06:09.168 --> 06:11.728
...and lets you get on with your day.

06:14.607 --> 06:18.236
President and Mrs. Reagan visited
the grieving families and bereaved widows

06:18.344 --> 06:21.973
of the more than 200 Marines
killed last Sunday in Beirut.

06:22.315 --> 06:25.716
He used the occasion
to condemn the actions of what he called

06:25.818 --> 06:27.080
"ruthless terrorists who..."

07:09.395 --> 07:10.953
What time is it?

07:13.265 --> 07:14.391
10:30.

07:15.501 --> 07:16.593
Fuck.

07:18.604 --> 07:19.696
Fuck.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.572
We gotta go. We're gonna be late.

07:31.217 --> 07:33.685
Right. That.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.349
I forgot.

07:39.759 --> 07:42.353
Christie, come on. What are you doing?

07:42.595 --> 07:44.222
I don't feel well.

07:45.731 --> 07:47.722
I don't really want to go.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.668
Neither do l.

07:52.872 --> 07:55.067
Look, I'm not gonna let you...

07:55.241 --> 07:56.674
Good morning.

08:02.281 --> 08:05.216
Look, you want to know
why you're not welcome at my house?

08:05.317 --> 08:06.648
Because you're fucked up!

08:06.752 --> 08:10.347
That's not a good enough reason.
That's not even a reason.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.256
That's just one person's opinion.

08:15.194 --> 08:18.960
Look, I don't even want to fucking deal
with you right now, do you understand me?

08:19.065 --> 08:22.228
Listen, I'm calling you from a payphone
outside of Barstow,

08:22.334 --> 08:25.360
and I ain't got any more quarters.
It's simple.

08:25.805 --> 08:29.332
Me and the Indian need a place to hang out
for a couple of days.

08:29.442 --> 08:30.431
We have a plan.

08:30.543 --> 08:33.671
I don't want to hear
about your fucking plan, Peter.

08:33.779 --> 08:36.907
It doesn't involve you,
so stop pissing yourself.

08:47.126 --> 08:48.957
When you lose a child,

08:50.129 --> 08:54.964
you can't help but wonder
what that child's life would have been like.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.796
You can't help but imagine his future.

09:00.272 --> 09:02.001
A future that now

09:03.809 --> 09:05.276
doesn't exist.

09:07.513 --> 09:12.849
But Bruce lived a full life,
and there's some comfort in that.

09:14.787 --> 09:18.382
And that he was a good boy,

09:20.192 --> 09:24.356
and that he had done all the things
he had ever wanted to do.

09:25.531 --> 09:30.161
That the privilege and freedom
that was granted to him

09:30.569 --> 09:35.939
during his brief time in this world
were what made him happy.

09:38.811 --> 09:44.147
I tell myself that I can only
cherish one fact.

09:45.985 --> 09:47.612
He had everything.

09:49.155 --> 09:52.022
And now, in conclusion,

09:53.459 --> 09:56.155
I'm going to play Bruce's favorite song.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.594
It meant a lot to him.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.004
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.836
So I made the reservations for 8:30.

10:49.915 --> 10:51.644
- Where?
- Spago.

10:51.951 --> 10:54.476
Okay. Did you tell Susan and Graham?

10:54.854 --> 10:57.288
Well, no. I thought it was
just gonna be the two of us.

10:57.389 --> 11:01.951
William, I'm not really comfortable
with that right now.

11:03.629 --> 11:04.687
Okay.

11:05.397 --> 11:08.161
Well, I'll call them
and tell them to join us, then.

11:08.267 --> 11:11.964
- Or you could call them.
- No. No, you should do that.

11:12.905 --> 11:13.963
Okay.

11:15.241 --> 11:18.267
What the fuck
was with that favorite song, man?

11:18.644 --> 11:21.545
Bruce had shitty taste in music, but no way.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.876
Personally, I think his mom just liked it.

11:25.985 --> 11:29.216
The real question is, what in the hell are
my mom and dad doing by the sushi bar?

11:29.321 --> 11:30.948
I mean, they're actually
talking to each other.

11:31.056 --> 11:33.081
At least your mom and dad are talking.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.717
My mom gets to talk to my dad
through his lawyers.

11:35.828 --> 11:38.524
Guess what?
I get to go to Hawaii with the asshole.

11:38.631 --> 11:41.031
I can't fucking believe this shit.

11:41.767 --> 11:44.211
I can't believe you guys
are acting this way.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.203
Acting?

11:45.504 --> 11:47.131
What way, Ray- Ray?

11:48.407 --> 11:50.875
Don't tell me he's gonna cry again.

11:51.810 --> 11:52.868
Fuck!

11:54.213 --> 11:56.204
Face it. Bruce was a jerk.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.442
Okay? He's dead. It's over.
Let's not fucking dwell on it.

11:58.550 --> 12:01.280
I can't believe you guys
don't fucking give a shit.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.945
You seem like you don't give a shit.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.080
Look, Raymond,
there's nothing we can do, okay?

12:05.190 --> 12:07.158
It happened. It's over.
It's time to move on.

12:07.259 --> 12:10.228
He's right, Raymond.
It's already been a week.

12:12.298 --> 12:13.663
Okay. Bruce...

12:14.066 --> 12:15.533
Bruce was a...

12:16.335 --> 12:17.700
A cool guy.

12:18.537 --> 12:20.596
What else can I tell you, Raymond?
I'm sorry it happened.

12:20.706 --> 12:23.368
"Bruce was a cool guy"? Really, Graham?

12:24.076 --> 12:25.907
Okay, what does that even mean, "Cool"?

12:26.011 --> 12:27.740
Especially after that shit
he pulled with Christie.

12:27.846 --> 12:31.441
- Martin, what the fuck are you doing?
- What shit did he pull with Christie?

12:31.550 --> 12:34.678
- Martin.
- Bruce was fucking her behind your back.

12:39.224 --> 12:40.816
What, like, you all knew about this?

12:40.926 --> 12:43.724
Graham, you always say
that you're not that serious about Christie.

12:43.829 --> 12:45.194
And it's not like you haven't fucked around.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.788
You know, you're never gonna win
Boyfriend of the Year.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.767
- She's my girlfriend, Martin.
- Look, who even knows if it's true?

12:50.869 --> 12:54.566
It's just something Bruce told us
and that he bragged about.

12:55.007 --> 12:57.032
Hey, does anybody want to go to a movie?

12:57.142 --> 12:58.769
Sure, what's playing?

12:58.877 --> 13:02.472
I can't believe you guys
are gonna go see a fucking movie.

13:02.982 --> 13:03.949
What the...

13:04.149 --> 13:05.673
I can't believe you don't give a shit, man.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.479
- I was there, you asshole.
- Hey, come on!

13:07.586 --> 13:09.213
I watched him fucking bleed to death
just like you did,

13:09.321 --> 13:11.414
so don't give me this shit
about how I don't care.

13:11.523 --> 13:14.890
I had his blood all over my face. Fuck.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.331
Someone should go talk to him.

13:20.432 --> 13:23.492
Tim, Bruce thought
Raymond was an asshole.

13:24.436 --> 13:28.099
He fucking loathed the dude, okay?
And what the fuck does it even matter?

13:28.207 --> 13:31.233
We're having a fucking wake
at the Beverly Hilton.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.072
I mean, come on, do you get it?

13:48.460 --> 13:50.018
Come on. Get up.

13:50.662 --> 13:53.426
Bruce wouldn't want to see you like this.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.766
He was my friend, right?

13:57.736 --> 13:59.704
Yeah. He was your friend.

14:00.939 --> 14:03.032
Are you lying to me, Graham?

14:06.145 --> 14:07.134
No.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.837
I'm telling you the truth.

14:33.839 --> 14:35.170
How's work?

14:36.008 --> 14:37.305
It's good.

14:38.377 --> 14:42.040
I have a full slate of movies
that are testing really high.

14:43.415 --> 14:46.851
- There's one you might really like.
- Yeah? What's that?

14:47.119 --> 14:51.852
It's a movie about this 12- year- old boy
who becomes the president.

14:52.925 --> 14:54.893
The president of what?

14:56.895 --> 14:58.522
The United States.

15:01.867 --> 15:04.995
Sounds better than the one
about the talking car.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.393
How's Graham?

15:06.505 --> 15:09.702
Well, you know your brother.
He's a little hard to reach.

15:09.808 --> 15:12.868
But I'm sure he's upset
about his friend's death,

15:12.978 --> 15:14.946
so, you know, it's tough.

15:15.981 --> 15:19.417
When I saw him at the memorial,
he seemed fine, though.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.111
He seemed fine at Bruce's memorial?

15:25.090 --> 15:26.148
Yeah.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.954
So how's Cheryl, by the way?

15:32.231 --> 15:34.165
I'm not seeing Cheryl anymore.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.325
What? When did this happen?

15:37.903 --> 15:41.430
That's something
I wanted to talk to you about, actually.

15:43.275 --> 15:46.676
- You talk to your mom lately?
- We talk.

15:46.912 --> 15:51.076
You know, when she's coherent,
which is rarely. Why?

15:51.183 --> 15:52.980
Well, Mom and l
are moving back in together.

15:53.085 --> 15:55.553
We're going to live together again.

15:59.558 --> 16:01.492
She didn't tell me that.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.493
- How do you feel about that?
- Great.

16:04.596 --> 16:07.895
Great. This is a really good move.
Yeah. Really good.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.797
Seriously? I mean,
you really think it's great?

16:09.902 --> 16:14.134
Well, to be honest, it hasn't totally hit me
that you might actually be serious.

16:14.239 --> 16:15.638
I'm serious.

16:18.243 --> 16:19.574
We're going to be a family again.

16:19.678 --> 16:23.876
Graham and I aren't moving back in, Dad.
We're not gonna be a family.

16:24.016 --> 16:28.419
You and Mom are gonna be a couple again,
but we're not gonna be a family.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.658
Martin?

16:43.802 --> 16:46.168
You can't call the house anymore.

16:47.706 --> 16:51.073
Why? Is there someone here who cares?

16:53.212 --> 16:55.806
You just can't come over here anymore.

17:02.554 --> 17:04.954
- No.
- Are you going to tell me why?

17:09.493 --> 17:11.484
William is moving back in.

17:19.871 --> 17:23.034
Are you telling me
he dumped the newscaster chick?

17:32.584 --> 17:33.642
So...

17:35.053 --> 17:37.487
Big Bad William is moving back in.

17:40.125 --> 17:43.959
So the fuck what? Unless you wanna
shell out for a room at the Bel- Air...

17:44.062 --> 17:47.190
No, Martin. Martin, you don't understand.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.958
We can't do this anymore.
We can't do it. It's over.

17:59.111 --> 18:00.237
Right.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.583
Just like it was over the last time?

18:08.954 --> 18:12.253
Martin, don't.

18:12.991 --> 18:14.049
Baby.

18:27.806 --> 18:28.932
I see.

18:32.944 --> 18:36.141
Well, could I at least

18:38.050 --> 18:39.176
borrow 60 bucks?

18:39.284 --> 18:42.549
I have to pay this guy
for these Billy ldol tickets.

18:42.654 --> 18:47.114
And I forgot to go to the lnsta- Teller
and, you know...

18:50.195 --> 18:53.358
You know,
it's just really a massive hassle, so...

19:37.476 --> 19:39.000
What can I do for you, Mr. Metro?

19:39.111 --> 19:42.012
Can you just get these kids
out of here, man?

20:01.533 --> 20:04.661
- Hey! What are you doing? Come on.
- All right. Time to go.

20:05.303 --> 20:06.327
No!

20:34.933 --> 20:37.197
Hey, Jackson. How's it hanging?

20:37.602 --> 20:39.968
What the fuck are you doing here?

20:40.605 --> 20:42.539
I told you I was coming.

20:42.941 --> 20:45.239
What'd you think, it was a joke?

20:47.379 --> 20:50.746
One fucking night. And that's it.
You understand me?

20:50.982 --> 20:55.476
Jackson, will you chill out, man,
and show your Uncle Pete a little love, huh?

20:58.957 --> 21:02.120
Well, where's this fucking
lndian friend of yours?

21:02.294 --> 21:03.522
Indian's in the desert.

21:03.628 --> 21:05.994
What the fuck does that even mean,
"The lndian's in the desert"?

21:06.097 --> 21:08.292
Indian did some bad stuff.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.059
Decided to stay in Barstow.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.963
He's laying low, if you get my drift.

21:15.006 --> 21:16.633
But Mary's in the van.

21:17.476 --> 21:20.001
- Who's Mary?
- Come on, I'll show you.

21:30.388 --> 21:31.753
Jackson, this is Mary.

21:32.524 --> 21:35.459
Mary? Mary, this is Jackson.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.127
Is she okay?

21:39.965 --> 21:43.162
Yeah, she's sort of just taking it all in.

21:44.369 --> 21:47.236
She saw some stuff. Bothered her.

21:48.273 --> 21:50.764
- How old is this girl?
- I don't know.

21:51.910 --> 21:54.640
Sixteen. Seventeen. I never ask.

23:31.176 --> 23:32.234
Lucifer?

23:32.344 --> 23:34.904
What the fuck are you doing
with two underage kids?

23:35.013 --> 23:36.708
How many times
are we gonna go through this?

23:36.815 --> 23:39.978
It does not matter if it was consensual.

23:40.151 --> 23:41.880
I fucked up my hand.

23:42.887 --> 23:45.355
How'd you do it? Did someone help you?

23:45.457 --> 23:47.482
I did it shaving, man. Who the fuck cares?

23:47.592 --> 23:51.358
My hand is fucked up.
Just... Just call a doctor, Roger.

23:52.063 --> 23:55.396
We are meeting Gary Gray,
the movie producer.

23:56.635 --> 24:00.571
You know, I don't know if I'm going
to be able to make that meeting, Roger.

24:00.672 --> 24:03.971
Look, I'll send the hotel doctor up
and then you're gonna pull it together.

24:04.075 --> 24:06.009
And when I knock on your door,
you are going to answer it

24:06.111 --> 24:09.672
without your cock hanging out
of some 14- year- old girl's ass. Got it?

24:09.781 --> 24:11.646
And you're going to be wearing something
with long sleeves.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.513
- Why?
- Multiple choice.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.245
A, you look nice in long sleeves.

24:15.353 --> 24:19.312
B, you have holes in your arms.
C, you have holes in your arms.

24:19.424 --> 24:21.824
Or D, you have holes in your arms.

24:24.829 --> 24:26.160
- C.
- Really?

26:24.382 --> 26:25.440
Yeah?

26:28.553 --> 26:30.316
Graham, it's for you.

26:31.456 --> 26:33.424
- It's Dirk.
- Shit.

26:50.175 --> 26:51.472
Hey, Dirk.

26:53.311 --> 26:54.369
Yeah.

26:57.582 --> 26:59.174
What do you need?

27:00.652 --> 27:02.813
Yeah, I can get that for you.

27:03.755 --> 27:04.813
Okay.

27:10.662 --> 27:12.289
A little business?

27:13.097 --> 27:15.156
Yeah. And my fucking car's at my mom's.

27:15.266 --> 27:18.667
- Can you give me a ride?
- Can't. I'm going to Hawaii.

27:18.770 --> 27:21.238
Well, fuck, dude,
give me a better excuse than that.

27:21.339 --> 27:23.398
I wish I could. Thanks.

27:26.344 --> 27:27.470
Aloha.

27:31.216 --> 27:33.116
Can you give me a lift?

27:33.518 --> 27:35.383
Don't look at me, dude.

27:56.674 --> 27:57.698
Bye.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.826
So how're you doing, Tim?

28:18.263 --> 28:21.494
I'm good. Fine. How are you?

28:22.033 --> 28:23.967
I'm doing good, I guess.

28:25.703 --> 28:28.399
- You want a drink?
- No, that's all right.

28:28.973 --> 28:30.804
Come on. Have a drink.

28:31.342 --> 28:34.106
- I'm okay.
- I'm gonna pour you one anyway.

28:37.015 --> 28:39.176
So, what have you been up to?

28:40.485 --> 28:44.182
Kind of a tough thing
about that friend of yours dying, huh?

28:46.324 --> 28:49.350
- You want to talk about that?
- What time does the plane leave?

28:52.130 --> 28:53.495
11:00 sharp.

29:02.707 --> 29:04.641
You wanna hear something?

29:07.645 --> 29:08.976
Who's this?

29:11.282 --> 29:13.978
- I think it's Devo.
- Who?

29:16.254 --> 29:18.222
It's a group called Devo.

29:19.891 --> 29:22.359
Great. I love it.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.356
Yeah.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.234
Hey. Hey.

29:32.036 --> 29:36.405
I think it's great you could finally
get away with your old man, you know?

29:36.507 --> 29:40.034
Your mom said maybe
you weren't gonna be able to make it.

29:40.578 --> 29:42.671
- But here you are.
- I'm here.

29:43.748 --> 29:47.115
We're going to Hawaii. It's gonna be great.

30:02.033 --> 30:05.730
The virus's unknown origin
and seeming selectivity is creating fear.

30:05.837 --> 30:09.898
Gays, intravenous drug users and Haitians
seem particularly to be at risk.

30:10.008 --> 30:13.102
The virus reacts almost like
a contagious form of cancer.

30:13.211 --> 30:16.806
I'm trying to stay positive.
I think in my situation it's very...

30:23.287 --> 30:28.315
And it's where film meets rock
and we're all happy.

30:30.094 --> 30:32.494
- Bryan.
- Okay, an idea for a movie.

30:32.797 --> 30:36.324
And the reason we came to Bryan Metro
is because people remember

30:36.434 --> 30:40.200
how intense that movie turned out
about the life of the band.

30:42.106 --> 30:46.509
Holy Christ, man, the four of you guys,
Sam and Matt and...

30:48.212 --> 30:51.340
- Ed. His name was Ed.
- Yeah. Yeah.

30:51.849 --> 30:55.012
That's known as a real tragedy, huh?
A real shame.

30:56.621 --> 30:58.782
Upsetting, too, I bet. Right?

30:59.290 --> 31:03.317
When your bassist jumps from the roof
of the Clift Hotel, I'd say so.

31:03.428 --> 31:05.453
They'd already split up by then, so...

31:05.563 --> 31:09.590
Yeah. Well, anyways,
since that movie about the life of the band

31:09.700 --> 31:13.727
turned out to be so cool and so profitable,
without exploiting anyone,

31:13.838 --> 31:17.831
we were wondering
if you'd be pleased and thrilled

31:18.509 --> 31:20.238
to star in a movie,

31:20.711 --> 31:23.578
one where you would actually play yourself.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.210
We get so many scripts.

31:26.317 --> 31:30.651
Bryan turned down Amadeus,
so we're very fussy.

31:30.755 --> 31:35.488
Well, this movie is basically your typical
rock- star- in- outer- space- type thing.

31:37.328 --> 31:39.888
There's this alien creature, this ET.

31:39.997 --> 31:42.591
- ET?
- Extraterrestrial. Alien.

31:42.700 --> 31:46.693
Yeah. The ET sabotages Bryan's limo
after a gig,

31:47.305 --> 31:50.934
and there's a big fiery chase and somehow...

31:52.343 --> 31:55.403
- We haven't quite got that nailed yet...
- Yeah, go on.

31:55.513 --> 31:59.313
You all end up on a planet
where Bryan falls in love with a princess.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.443
We're thinking Pat Benatar
or a Go- Go for that.

32:04.288 --> 32:06.483
In order to escape the planet,

32:06.724 --> 32:10.216
you have to play in this big concert
for the emperor,

32:11.262 --> 32:14.823
who's basically this giant tomato.

32:20.938 --> 32:22.872
So it's madcap, right?

32:23.841 --> 32:25.706
- It's not tacky...
- Yes.

32:26.277 --> 32:29.303
...and everyone is getting
very excited by it.

32:32.617 --> 32:33.743
Bryan?

32:37.555 --> 32:39.079
Bryan. Bryan?

32:43.995 --> 32:46.156
Thank you so much for coming.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.818
Hey, what are you doing here?

33:14.926 --> 33:17.759
Christie, you know my sister, Susan, right?

33:17.862 --> 33:20.330
- Have you guys met?
- Yeah. Hi.

33:24.702 --> 33:27.102
Okay, well, I'm gonna get a drink.

33:27.305 --> 33:30.706
- Cool, baby. You wanna bring me one, too?
- Nice shirt.

33:31.242 --> 33:32.368
Ditto.

33:33.911 --> 33:37.142
Does she always dress like that?
Movies, restaurants and stuff?

33:37.248 --> 33:40.012
- You a little jealous?
- Graham!

33:40.117 --> 33:41.209
Hey, mellow out.

33:41.319 --> 33:42.843
Did you know
they were gonna go through with it?

33:42.954 --> 33:44.012
What?

33:44.889 --> 33:48.347
Mom and Dad? Yeah.
Mom mentioned something when I woke up.

33:48.459 --> 33:50.188
What a scandal, huh?

33:50.728 --> 33:52.025
Oh, my God, you're so stoned.

33:52.129 --> 33:54.029
You're such a stoner.
I can't even talk to you.

33:54.131 --> 33:56.725
I'm really not stoned, okay?
Just mellow out.

34:02.273 --> 34:06.039
- You should talk to him.
- And say what exactly?

34:07.478 --> 34:11.414
I don't know. "Dad, this isn't a good idea.
Don't go through..."

34:12.583 --> 34:14.141
Okay? All right.

34:21.726 --> 34:22.987
Let's take off, all right? What do you say?

34:23.094 --> 34:26.085
Graham, do you even care
what he did to Mom?

34:27.063 --> 34:29.862
And now he's back and he's just gonna do
the same thing again.

34:29.967 --> 34:32.400
Look, I had to take care of her,
okay, Graham?

34:32.503 --> 34:35.938
I had to take care of Mom,
and I'm not gonna do it again!

34:36.040 --> 34:37.803
Graham. Graham!

34:39.043 --> 34:42.877
Please. We have to do something, okay?

34:43.614 --> 34:45.775
If Dad pulls the same shit again,
Mom isn't gonna make it.

34:45.882 --> 34:48.647
This will destroy her. Do you understand?

35:39.970 --> 35:42.404
Cheryl, there's someone on the phone.

35:42.506 --> 35:44.599
- William Sloan.
- Thank you.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.186
- What?
- I called the house and no one answered.

35:58.289 --> 36:00.723
I was hoping it was the wrong number.

36:00.825 --> 36:03.191
Yeah, well, it's not the wrong number.

36:03.294 --> 36:04.591
So why haven't you been home?

36:04.695 --> 36:08.722
Because I've been busy.
I'm filling in for Suzanne Yakomiato.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.768
I really want to see you.

36:12.236 --> 36:14.227
What about Laura, William?

36:14.605 --> 36:15.697
What about her?

36:16.607 --> 36:18.199
What about Laura?

36:20.144 --> 36:22.135
I think I really miss you.

36:23.314 --> 36:25.680
I think I'm making a big mistake.

37:08.859 --> 37:10.588
- Let me go!
- Shut up!

37:11.796 --> 37:13.855
- Mary, go!
- I have no license.

37:13.964 --> 37:16.330
Get in the fucking car and drive.

37:32.616 --> 37:34.243
What do you think?

37:35.152 --> 37:36.619
About what?

37:37.288 --> 37:39.256
What do you think I mean?

37:40.024 --> 37:41.616
Next to us. Them.

37:47.798 --> 37:49.356
What about them?

37:49.667 --> 37:51.760
Don't you go out with girls?

37:52.403 --> 37:53.700
Pardon me?

37:54.638 --> 37:57.835
Don't you, like, date females?

37:59.810 --> 38:01.675
What are you asking me?

38:03.814 --> 38:05.509
The odds look good.

38:07.251 --> 38:09.242
The odds look pretty good.

38:12.122 --> 38:14.716
Ladies, what are you drinking tonight?

38:14.859 --> 38:15.985
Pahohoes.

38:16.093 --> 38:19.529
Pahohoes? That sounds intriguing.

38:20.564 --> 38:22.191
They're delicious.

38:22.766 --> 38:24.131
Hey, Hickey?

38:25.035 --> 38:30.268
Why don't you bring these two gorgeous
ladies another round of pahohoes?

38:31.876 --> 38:33.605
Where you gals from?

38:34.044 --> 38:35.978
We came in from Chicago.

38:36.380 --> 38:38.575
I'm Patty and this is Darlene.

38:39.183 --> 38:40.980
Yeah. The Windy City.

38:42.119 --> 38:44.747
- I know it well.
- Where are you both from?

38:44.855 --> 38:46.220
Los Angeles.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.148
City of Angels.

38:50.528 --> 38:53.554
I'm Les Price and this is my son, Tim.

38:56.300 --> 38:57.927
He's a little shy.

38:58.636 --> 39:00.365
Just the two of you?

39:00.671 --> 39:02.366
Just the two of us.

39:05.809 --> 39:08.141
Hey. I hope...

39:09.246 --> 39:13.683
I hope I'm not being too forward
if I may ask you something.

39:14.051 --> 39:16.611
- I'm sure you won't be, Les.
- Jesus.

39:16.720 --> 39:20.121
Well, I was just wondering
if you're here with anyone.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.187
- We're here alone.
- All alone.

39:27.031 --> 39:29.795
- All alone.
- Can I have the key to the room?

39:29.900 --> 39:31.492
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the room.

39:31.602 --> 39:32.967
Where do you think I'd be going?

39:33.070 --> 39:34.476
You didn't finish your drink.

39:34.577 --> 39:36.699
I don't want the drink.
Just give me the key.

39:36.807 --> 39:38.570
I'll go up with you.

39:38.676 --> 39:43.807
No. Just stay here, see how it plays out
with Patty and Marlene.

39:44.181 --> 39:45.671
That's Darlene.

39:58.596 --> 40:00.655
What's wrong with him, Les?

40:02.833 --> 40:04.528
Troubles in school.

40:06.904 --> 40:09.099
- His mother.
- Okay.

40:20.384 --> 40:21.874
No, no thanks.

40:23.954 --> 40:26.923
You said you were hungry.
I made this for you.

40:27.024 --> 40:30.460
No, my stomach's queasy.
I'm not really hungry anymore.

40:31.128 --> 40:33.289
I really don't know how something
like this could happen.

40:33.397 --> 40:37.060
It all seemed to be going so well
and now it's just a big mess.

40:37.167 --> 40:41.035
It'll never happen again, I promise.
You're not gonna fire me, are you?

40:41.138 --> 40:43.504
Well, no, I'm not gonna fire you.

40:45.409 --> 40:49.277
Look, I have no idea what this is.

40:51.348 --> 40:55.045
- And another one on my foot.
- Yeah, I don't know what it is either.

40:55.152 --> 40:57.712
Look, Christie, tell me something.

40:58.022 --> 40:59.080
What?

41:00.724 --> 41:02.988
What do you think about Martin?

41:03.260 --> 41:05.524
He's cool. He's hot.

41:06.196 --> 41:07.493
Yeah, hot.

41:08.432 --> 41:12.596
Well, I know that, but I'm just not sure

41:12.703 --> 41:15.331
I'm at the same place that you are,

41:16.407 --> 41:19.934
you know, with everything
that's been going on with him.

41:23.414 --> 41:25.780
Forget it. Sorry I brought it up.

41:26.316 --> 41:27.476
Graham.

41:28.652 --> 41:31.246
Martin's not even staying here.
He's staying at Nina Metro's.

41:31.355 --> 41:33.721
Even though he said she was insane.

41:33.824 --> 41:36.987
That reminds me. Did you get tickets
for tomorrow night at the Greek?

41:37.094 --> 41:38.459
Bryan Metro?

41:41.198 --> 41:42.358
Graham.

41:44.868 --> 41:48.065
You know he doesn't mean
as much as you to me.

41:49.807 --> 41:50.899
Come on.

41:51.008 --> 41:53.442
Graham, we're all just having fun,
you know?

41:53.544 --> 41:56.707
Like, you take it all so seriously.

41:56.814 --> 41:59.510
Yeah, but you're also sleeping with him,
and it's just stressing me out.

41:59.616 --> 42:02.278
What's wrong? You know I'm on the pill.

42:07.057 --> 42:08.217
Graham?

42:09.259 --> 42:10.726
- Graham?
- Yeah?

42:11.729 --> 42:13.822
You're forgetting something.

42:14.064 --> 42:15.122
What?

42:21.638 --> 42:23.799
We're both sleeping with him.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.506
We're both sleeping with Martin.

42:26.777 --> 42:28.768
And if I'm cool with that,

42:30.481 --> 42:31.641
then...

42:33.283 --> 42:34.910
To new beginnings.

43:05.015 --> 43:08.348
So I'm totally psyched.
We're gonna go see Bryan Metro

43:08.452 --> 43:10.545
at the Greek tomorrow night.

43:10.854 --> 43:12.719
That is, if Graham remembered
to get the tickets.

43:12.823 --> 43:15.587
Yeah, I got the tickets,
and stop saying "totally."

43:15.692 --> 43:18.627
- Who'd you get them from?
- Actually, honey, from me.

43:18.729 --> 43:20.720
- Through the studio.
- Good.

43:21.198 --> 43:23.189
I'm glad he didn't go through Martin.

43:23.300 --> 43:24.267
I didn't want to go through Martin,

43:24.368 --> 43:26.233
even though
he could have gotten us backstage.

43:26.336 --> 43:30.739
Who cares? He's such a stoner.
He's so into himself.

43:30.841 --> 43:34.140
Him and his totally grody tan
and his stupid hair.

43:34.511 --> 43:37.537
Plus, Mom, get this. He's a male prostitute.

43:37.915 --> 43:41.749
- Why did you direct that statement to me?
- Just mellow out, okay?

43:41.852 --> 43:43.820
I don't even know
why we're talking about Martin.

43:43.921 --> 43:47.721
And Mom, Martin's not a male prostitute.
That's on the record.

43:48.492 --> 43:49.823
Why do you think I would care?

43:49.927 --> 43:52.327
Martin is coming to the show
with me and Christie,

43:52.429 --> 43:54.556
so I hope you get over
how, "like, totally grody"

43:54.665 --> 43:56.292
you think he is by tomorrow night.

43:56.400 --> 44:00.496
I hope your girlfriend remembers
to wear a shirt by tomorrow night.

44:01.038 --> 44:03.199
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the restroom.

44:03.307 --> 44:07.403
And hopefully, when I get back,
my lovely children

44:07.511 --> 44:11.413
will have finished their conversation
about their delightful friends.

44:24.261 --> 44:25.558
Hi, honey.

44:27.798 --> 44:30.164
You're here with her, aren't you?

44:31.301 --> 44:32.962
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

44:36.807 --> 44:38.035
No, don't.

44:38.141 --> 44:40.405
Sweetie, I know you're pissed.
I understand, I understand.

44:40.510 --> 44:41.807
But I missed you. I couldn't help it.

44:41.912 --> 44:44.039
- I can't do this.
- You can't do what?

44:44.147 --> 44:47.014
You don't want me anymore?
Sweetie, I want you so bad.

44:47.117 --> 44:49.312
That's not the point, William.

44:49.519 --> 44:53.888
I can't sit here again
and listen to you quote numbers

44:53.991 --> 44:57.324
about how expensive your fucking divorce
is gonna be.

44:57.561 --> 45:01.327
Is it not enough that you've made
everyone fucking miserable?

45:02.366 --> 45:04.095
Just stay away.

45:05.836 --> 45:06.996
Please.

45:15.445 --> 45:18.937
You know, I kept the condo.
I haven't given it up yet.

45:20.617 --> 45:23.882
We could meet there tomorrow night.
What do you say?

45:25.422 --> 45:28.084
Or I got the Piper Cub back.

45:28.191 --> 45:32.184
It's at the hangar. It's ready to go.
We could fly to Vegas and stay at Caesars.

45:32.296 --> 45:33.923
- lt'll be amazing.
- My God, William,

45:34.031 --> 45:35.658
I'm not going to Vegas with you.

45:39.303 --> 45:41.897
Well, at least you're going to be
at the Brodkey benefit Friday, right?

45:42.005 --> 45:44.303
We could talk there. Okay?

45:44.408 --> 45:45.466
Sure.

45:46.710 --> 45:49.440
- Why not?
- Great, honey. That's what I want to hear.

45:49.546 --> 45:51.741
It's so good to see your face.

45:53.617 --> 45:55.608
We'll figure it out. It'll be okay.

45:55.719 --> 45:58.415
- Yeah.
- Anyway, I better go. Okay?

46:05.462 --> 46:06.520
Fuck!

46:55.012 --> 46:58.345
Laura, are we going
to the Brodkey benefit on Friday?

47:00.951 --> 47:04.387
Why would we go to the Brodkey benefit
on Friday night?

47:05.155 --> 47:06.452
That's TV.

47:08.358 --> 47:09.950
It's not only TV.

47:10.761 --> 47:12.524
And it should be fun.

47:14.398 --> 47:18.494
- Besides that, it's for a good cause.
- It's for a perfume, William.

47:19.936 --> 47:23.372
I don't want to go to the Brodkey benefit
Friday night.

47:24.508 --> 47:26.908
What would you like to do instead?

47:28.412 --> 47:29.538
Sleep?

47:30.847 --> 47:32.405
Lay by the pool?

47:33.216 --> 47:35.081
Maybe count your shoes?

47:42.125 --> 47:44.616
Can Daddy borrow $4,000?

47:51.468 --> 47:54.130
What the fuck are you still doing here?

47:54.805 --> 47:56.864
I thought I told you to go.

47:58.175 --> 48:00.769
What? Are you gonna fucking ignore me?

48:13.590 --> 48:15.558
What the fuck's going on?

48:36.113 --> 48:39.879
What the fuck are you doing, Peter?
What the fuck did you do?

48:42.452 --> 48:44.317
Answer me, God damn it!

48:52.829 --> 48:54.660
Shut your mouth, Jack.

48:55.966 --> 48:57.433
What the fuck?

48:57.968 --> 49:01.768
The kid's gonna bring us some money.
That's the plan.

49:01.972 --> 49:05.601
That's the plan I informed you about.
This is the plan.

49:05.709 --> 49:08.735
Your fucking plan
is goddamn holding a kid ransom?

49:08.845 --> 49:12.747
It's not me, Jack.
It's them freaks I met out in West LA.

49:12.983 --> 49:15.042
The people I heard about out in Barstow.

49:15.152 --> 49:18.553
They pay $6,000, $7,000 a pop
for a package like that.

49:18.788 --> 49:20.756
You make me fucking sick.

49:32.469 --> 49:35.632
Hey, man, you need to relax.
That's your problem, Jackson.

49:35.739 --> 49:37.730
You don't know how to kick back.

49:37.841 --> 49:40.639
Even when you was a kid out in the desert,

49:42.712 --> 49:47.672
and all there was
was the sand and the rock and the silence,

49:48.685 --> 49:52.587
you could never accept the fact
that that's where you belong,

49:53.623 --> 49:56.319
and that's where you're always gonna be.

49:57.260 --> 49:59.228
That was a long time ago.

50:00.397 --> 50:03.889
And we're not
in the fucking desert anymore, Uncle Pete.

50:06.036 --> 50:07.833
I think we still are.

50:18.315 --> 50:21.011
- Hello?
- ls Martin there?

50:22.485 --> 50:24.544
I don't know. Let me check.

50:31.494 --> 50:33.121
Couldn't find him.

50:34.397 --> 50:36.592
Do you know where he might be?

50:36.800 --> 50:38.893
Have you tried his place in Westwood?

50:39.002 --> 50:40.993
- No, I haven't.
- He could be there,

50:41.104 --> 50:44.232
or he could be finishing up that music video
on the hills.

50:45.442 --> 50:48.172
- ls this Julie?
- Julie?

50:48.745 --> 50:52.875
Yeah. The girl Martin picked up
at 385 North? With the white rabbit?

50:53.683 --> 50:56.709
We all went back to my place
and partied with Graham?

50:56.820 --> 50:58.879
You and Martin disappeared?

50:59.522 --> 51:00.648
Hello?

51:01.024 --> 51:03.686
No. This isn't her. I'll call back.

51:22.579 --> 51:25.605
Fuck me. Cut. Cut!

51:27.350 --> 51:30.251
What the fuck are you doing, dude?
I can't see shit.

51:30.353 --> 51:32.753
- Hey, Graham.
- Yes, totally fucking excellent.

51:32.856 --> 51:36.019
Perfect timing, dude.
We are so in need of your services.

51:36.126 --> 51:38.526
Wait, hold on a second, Leon.
We really have to get this shot.

51:38.628 --> 51:39.890
The video doesn't make sense without it.

51:39.996 --> 51:42.260
It's a fucking video, Martin.
It doesn't need to make sense.

51:42.365 --> 51:45.061
It just needs to be not lame.

51:45.769 --> 51:47.293
Graham, you got us covered?

51:47.404 --> 51:50.373
- Yeah, man, you're all set.
- Totally excellent.

51:50.874 --> 51:54.002
Hey, hey, hey.
Isn't Christie supposed to be here?

51:54.110 --> 51:55.668
I thought she was supposed to be the star.

51:55.779 --> 51:58.714
I did, too. But she's a little unreliable.

51:59.616 --> 52:01.311
Maybe you realize that now?

52:01.418 --> 52:03.818
So, where are you staying tonight?

52:03.987 --> 52:05.978
Probably at Nina's, in Malibu.

52:06.089 --> 52:08.284
- Who's Nina?
- Nina. Nina Metro.

52:09.359 --> 52:11.520
- Bryan Metro's wife?
- Ex- wife.

52:13.630 --> 52:14.790
Christ.

52:15.065 --> 52:16.123
Where are you staying?

52:16.232 --> 52:18.427
Honestly, Martin, I don't know
how I feel about the situation anymore.

52:18.535 --> 52:21.265
I think I'm just gonna crash at my mom's.

52:21.371 --> 52:24.704
- Look, I've got eight more shots.
- Yeah. You're busy.

52:24.974 --> 52:27.067
Can we shoot this, you fucking cokeheads?

52:46.863 --> 52:50.390
Hey, Tim, why don't you get your old man
another mai tai?

52:55.772 --> 52:58.240
- Hey.
- What?

52:58.808 --> 53:01.868
Why don't you get your dad
and yourself a drink?

53:03.613 --> 53:05.774
- What do you want?
- Mai tai.

53:11.788 --> 53:12.846
Okay.

54:25.962 --> 54:27.657
What are you up to?

54:28.565 --> 54:30.556
Met a girl from San Diego.

54:34.037 --> 54:35.470
Hey, come on.

54:48.985 --> 54:50.543
- Hey, Cheryl. Nice to see you.
- Hi.

54:50.653 --> 54:52.086
- How are you, sweetie?
- Good.

54:52.188 --> 54:53.712
I just wanted to grab
a quick salad or something.

54:53.823 --> 54:56.792
- Do you have anything open?
- Sure. Let me see.

55:05.869 --> 55:07.166
Excuse me.

55:15.812 --> 55:16.870
Shit!

55:20.183 --> 55:22.014
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!

56:05.428 --> 56:06.588
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:06.696 --> 56:08.391
What would you like, hun?

56:08.498 --> 56:11.023
A garden salad and a glass of water, please.

56:11.134 --> 56:12.192
Okay.

56:13.536 --> 56:15.936
- You're Cheryl Moore, right?
- Yeah.

56:16.139 --> 56:17.936
- I think you're great, honey.
- Thank you.

56:18.041 --> 56:21.442
The piece you did
on the anniversary of Sharon Tate.

56:22.111 --> 56:25.012
I remember when that happened.
It was so awful.

56:25.114 --> 56:27.105
- Yeah.
- lt was just so sad.

56:27.450 --> 56:29.281
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

56:32.855 --> 56:34.152
All right.

56:39.128 --> 56:43.189
Hey! Aren't you on the news or something?

56:43.299 --> 56:45.267
- Yes.
- You're Cheryl Moore, right?

56:45.368 --> 56:47.734
- Yeah. Do you have a light?
- Sure.

56:49.339 --> 56:50.567
Listen...

56:52.508 --> 56:54.032
Can I have your autograph?

56:54.143 --> 56:57.943
'Cause I am, like, your biggest fan.

57:00.883 --> 57:02.043
There you go.

57:02.151 --> 57:04.449
Thanks a lot, Cher. By the way,

57:04.821 --> 57:07.847
we're opening for Bryan Metro
at the Greek tonight.

57:07.957 --> 57:09.390
You wanna go?

57:09.492 --> 57:11.323
You know, I really don't think I can.

57:11.427 --> 57:13.895
Got it. Thanks a lot, Cheryl.

57:26.909 --> 57:27.876
Hello?

57:28.444 --> 57:30.605
What's going on? How are you?

57:32.882 --> 57:34.975
How did you get this number?

57:37.020 --> 57:38.988
Did Roger give it to you?

57:42.125 --> 57:43.786
Could I just speak to Jamie, please?

57:44.127 --> 57:46.493
Well, he can't right now. He's...

57:47.597 --> 57:50.191
- He's on the beach with a friend.
- Who?

57:51.534 --> 57:54.094
A friend of his or a friend of yours?

57:57.774 --> 57:59.935
You know, that's just great, Nina.
That's great.

58:00.043 --> 58:02.409
Can we... Can we just get this over with?

58:02.512 --> 58:05.879
Can I just speak to my kid this time
without having to freak out? Please?

58:05.982 --> 58:09.383
You know you don't even have
visitation rights, Bryan.

58:09.719 --> 58:11.584
Just put him on the phone, Nina.

58:11.688 --> 58:13.781
No, I mean, I don't even know
why you want me to say this...

58:13.890 --> 58:15.653
Just tell whoever you're fucking

58:15.758 --> 58:17.726
to bring my kid out
and put him on the phone!

58:17.827 --> 58:20.660
Okay. No. You know what, Bryan?
I'm going to hang up now.

58:20.763 --> 58:23.698
Just because I don't have visitation rights

58:23.800 --> 58:26.234
does not mean
I'm not allowed to talk to my kid.

58:26.335 --> 58:29.429
Now, if you want me to call my lawyers,
Nina, I'll call my fucking lawyers!

58:29.539 --> 58:31.530
Fuck your fucking lawyers, Bryan!

58:31.641 --> 58:33.404
- I'll call my fucking lawyers.
- Fuck them!

58:34.510 --> 58:36.910
Fuck, all right, Nina, look, I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

58:37.013 --> 58:39.481
Please, Nina.
I don't mean to shout. I just...

58:39.582 --> 58:44.315
Bryan, listen to me.
Don't you fucking call me or him ever again.

58:44.420 --> 58:46.479
He's fucking afraid of you!

58:47.356 --> 58:48.789
Fucking afraid of me?

58:48.891 --> 58:51.758
And don't fucking... You...
What about you, you Medusa?

58:51.861 --> 58:53.488
You fucking Medusa!

59:06.909 --> 59:10.208
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!

59:10.313 --> 59:13.544
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!

59:13.649 --> 59:17.176
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!

01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:44.866
Good evening, sir.

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:48.333
Surprised?

01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:04.312
Do you want to know who I am?

01:02:06.822 --> 01:02:08.756
Are you from around here?

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:12.954
Not really. I'm actually from Nebraska.
A little town near Lincoln.

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:28.975
You had a job at the mall, right?

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:31.943
But the mall closed down, right?

01:02:35.217 --> 01:02:37.151
It's all empty now, huh?

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:40.417
Have you been there?

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:44.189
I've been to a mall in Nebraska.

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:48.763
It's all flat.

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:53.825
It's all totally, totally

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.262
flat.

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:01.373
Come here.

01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:37.128
Clear the area.

01:04:37.673 --> 01:04:40.335
All of these vehicles need to be moved.

01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:42.301
What's going on?

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:44.913
You scared me.

01:04:45.981 --> 01:04:50.247
I don't know. I guess some guy's
like threatening to shoot his wife

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.453
or maybe he shot her or something.

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:55.753
They got the SWAT team out there
and everything, man.

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:59.350
- lf I were you, I wouldn't go out there.
- Yeah, I won't.

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:03.932
So you're on the eleventh floor, right?

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:07.059
Yeah, the guy who does the videos
visits you all the time.

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:10.502
You mean Martin.
It's actually my girlfriend's place.

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:15.135
- I'm Graham.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:17.637
- You want a cigarette?
- Yeah.

01:05:32.628 --> 01:05:33.788
It's...

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:40.161
It's kind of a small world,
'cause the guy who raised me out here?

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:45.801
He used to work at the studio your dad runs.
You know, so he was part of the system.

01:05:47.042 --> 01:05:50.205
But I guess they had to let him go.

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:54.774
Something happened
with some actress or something,

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:57.751
and then he kind of had a breakdown,

01:05:57.853 --> 01:05:59.912
so we went back to Barstow.

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:02.520
But I came back here,

01:06:04.426 --> 01:06:06.155
'cause I'm an actor.

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:09.024
I was in a commercial for gum,

01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:13.362
and I was the boyfriend
in a Clearasil commercial.

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:25.278
You know, it's just kind of hard
'cause you can't really make it in this town

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:28.714
unless you're really willing
to do some awful things.

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:33.312
And, you know, I'm willing.

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:37.782
- Yeah, I guess.
- But I really want to get into video.

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:41.420
That's why I was thinking that Mark guy
would be a great contact.

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.895
It's Martin.

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:54.940
All right. Well, thanks for the...

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:58.677
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah.

01:07:02.751 --> 01:07:04.514
Hey, where you going?

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:10.884
I've got to drink some juice
and then get some sleep.

01:07:14.296 --> 01:07:17.231
You sure you don't want to stay?
I could really use the company.

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:18.960
Sorry, I gotta go.

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:24.737
I think something's gonna happen.

01:07:28.143 --> 01:07:30.270
Les Price for two at 8:00.

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:32.839
It's actually three.

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:37.646
- I asked Rachel.
- Who's Rachel?

01:07:38.053 --> 01:07:40.453
The girl I met on the beach today.

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:43.352
And when were you going to tell me this?

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:46.319
I don't know. Now, I guess.

01:07:46.795 --> 01:07:49.355
I didn't think it would be a problem.

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:51.299
I mean, is it?

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.426
Well, I guess there's going
to be three of us.

01:07:54.903 --> 01:07:57.064
- Hey, Tim.
- Hey, how are you?

01:07:57.873 --> 01:07:59.340
Good, thanks.

01:08:00.342 --> 01:08:03.004
Rachel, this is my dad, Les Price.

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:05.307
- Hi, Mr. Price.
- Hello, Rachel.

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:07.842
You here in Hawaii on your own?

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:10.748
No, but my parents are in Maui tonight.

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:14.047
So... You both look nice.

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:17.624
- Thanks, you look great.
- Yes. You do.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:22.662
So what did you two do
after the beach today?

01:08:23.365 --> 01:08:26.595
Well, I watched Tim perfect his hair
for two hours,

01:08:27.469 --> 01:08:31.496
then spend another two hours
choosing which shirt he's gonna wear.

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.304
Now I understand why.

01:08:38.212 --> 01:08:41.182
So did anybody see
that Robert Waters is here?

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:44.648
- Who's that?
- Come on, Tim. Robert Waters.

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:47.612
Star of The Flight Patrol.

01:08:48.223 --> 01:08:50.087
It's a television show.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.527
On television.

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:56.660
I don't know.
I guess I just must not watch enough TV.

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:58.027
Yeah, right.

01:08:58.133 --> 01:09:01.102
Wait. You don't know who Robert Waters is?

01:09:02.203 --> 01:09:04.069
No, I don't.

01:09:04.606 --> 01:09:08.303
- You do, I guess?
- Well, I met him at Reagan's inauguration.

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:11.707
God, I thought everybody knew
who Robert Waters is.

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.410
I don't.

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:19.381
- Why do you guys care?
- Well, it's a little weird.

01:09:19.888 --> 01:09:22.550
- Why?
- He's here with three guys.

01:09:24.259 --> 01:09:29.890
The very macho star of Flight Patrol
is here with three dudes.

01:09:30.532 --> 01:09:31.520
So?

01:09:31.633 --> 01:09:34.430
So one of them tried to pick up Tim today.

01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:35.934
Me? When?

01:09:36.037 --> 01:09:38.404
At the beach. Today at the bar.

01:09:38.807 --> 01:09:41.674
- That guy?
- Yeah. That guy.

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:46.477
Look, he was nice. He was a nice guy.

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:49.115
Yeah, I'm sure he was really nice.

01:09:49.484 --> 01:09:50.782
Real nice.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.224
You smoke?

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:08.428
- I told you, Tim.
- What?

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:12.603
- It's bad for you.
- He knows. I told him last night.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.344
Am I blowing this in your face?

01:10:20.749 --> 01:10:23.775
I mean, really?
Is this actually bothering you?

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.912
I mean, we're outside.

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:29.513
Look, you just shouldn't smoke, Tim.

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:33.219
Okay.

01:10:33.829 --> 01:10:35.922
I'm gonna go finish this cigarette
somewhere else,

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:38.124
since you two don't like it.

01:10:40.969 --> 01:10:43.767
The odds looking pretty good tonight, Dad?

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:48.872
- Tim, stop.
- Let him go.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:54.178
Well, thank you for dinner, Les.

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:57.650
- Hey. Hey. We're not done here.
- No, look, just tell Tim that I'm sorry.

01:10:57.753 --> 01:11:00.153
Let's have another drink. Come on.

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:01.882
You know, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:04.652
Don't let him spoil the party. Come on.

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:07.156
We're not going to another shitty party

01:11:07.262 --> 01:11:09.628
just because
you're fucking the hostess, okay?

01:11:09.731 --> 01:11:12.598
And she's married, and her husband's there.

01:11:13.235 --> 01:11:16.136
I mean, you'll honestly fuck anybody, right?

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:18.834
I fucked you, dude.

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:22.468
Nice.

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:29.509
Where the fuck was Christie tonight?
Wasn't she supposed to be at the party?

01:11:30.519 --> 01:11:33.386
Christ, I guess I forgot to tell you.
She hasn't been feeling too well.

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:35.184
She had to stay in.

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:42.162
- Wait, are you staying at her place?
- No. She moved in with me and Nina.

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:45.834
- Nina... Nina Metro, out in the colony?
- Yeah.

01:11:50.172 --> 01:11:52.868
- Since when?
- It's been a couple of days.

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:57.281
It's weird, she has these night sweats

01:11:57.282 --> 01:12:00.373
and swollen glands and this weird rash

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:03.883
- and these little purple bruises...
- Wait, she's sick?

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.847
Yeah. She wanted to get out of the condo
and hang at the beach.

01:12:06.955 --> 01:12:09.321
She said she'd feel better there.

01:12:16.064 --> 01:12:18.658
Martin, I need to know something.

01:12:21.937 --> 01:12:26.567
Are you and Christie, like, fucking around?
You guys fuck around when I'm not there?

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:28.905
No. No.

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:33.905
I wouldn't do that to you.

01:12:37.953 --> 01:12:39.614
Holy shit. You...

01:12:41.089 --> 01:12:44.149
Wow. You really, really like her, don't you?

01:12:44.259 --> 01:12:48.025
This isn't just a thing for you.
You actually care about her.

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:52.591
- I need something, Martin.
- You need some fucking ludes.

01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:55.192
No, I need something more than this!

01:12:56.972 --> 01:13:00.464
Graham, what else is there?
You already have everything.

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:07.138
I need someone to tell me what is good.

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:12.744
Okay? And I need someone
to tell me what's bad.

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:17.123
Because if nobody
tells you these things, Martin,

01:13:17.225 --> 01:13:20.285
then how do you know
what's good and what's bad?

01:13:21.463 --> 01:13:24.626
And then what happens?
What happens...

01:13:24.766 --> 01:13:28.167
What happens then,
when nobody tells you these things?

01:14:06.274 --> 01:14:09.141
- Can I help you?
- Hi, I'm Dirk. Who are you?

01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:13.511
- Nobody. What the fuck do you want?
- I'm looking for someone.

01:14:14.916 --> 01:14:19.376
- Well, I'm the only one here, so...
- But I have something to pick up here.

01:14:20.288 --> 01:14:23.189
I think you've probably got the wrong house.

01:14:25.427 --> 01:14:26.894
Where's Peter?

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.730
- He's not here.
- Dude, a deal was made.

01:14:30.832 --> 01:14:33.300
Now I don't know who you are,

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.161
but there's something here
that now belongs to us.

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:40.833
Look, I don't want any trouble,
so I think you should just leave, all right?

01:14:43.211 --> 01:14:44.940
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, all right?

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:48.983
- You got the wrong place.
- No. This is the right place.

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:57.617
The fuck are you looking at?

01:14:59.761 --> 01:15:02.229
Look, I told you, Peter's not here.

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:08.162
And I don't know anything
about what the fuck you're talking about.

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:11.705
- I'm just really tired.
- This is very important,

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:14.367
so think carefully before you answer.

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:17.368
Tell me where the fuck Peter is.

01:15:17.569 --> 01:15:19.843
I can't tell you that,
'cause I don't know.

01:15:19.948 --> 01:15:23.577
This is simple. Peter was paid.
We want what we paid for.

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:27.546
- Now where is it?
- I swear to God, I don't know.

01:15:28.924 --> 01:15:30.653
Well, you better find out because

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:33.284
he will be in a very dark place
if we become disappointed,

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:35.989
and we're becoming extremely disappointed.

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:38.760
As soon as he gets back, I'll tell him.

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:41.629
I just don't know when that's gonna be.

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:53.742
I'll see you again.

01:16:02.157 --> 01:16:03.522
Laura. I...

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:07.184
I need a shot,
and I couldn't find any syringes anywhere.

01:16:07.295 --> 01:16:10.059
I mean, with the move and everything.
You don't have any, do you?

01:16:10.165 --> 01:16:11.928
I've got one in here.

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:58.370
I saw her, William.
I saw her at the restaurant.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.043
- You saw who?
- Don't make me say her fucking name.

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:06.453
- What are you talking about?
- Just go get dressed.

01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:08.955
I'm not gonna have this conversation
with you if you're going to lie.

01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:12.493
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it anymore!

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:20.030
If you want to talk to me,
you're going to tell me the truth!

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:25.368
- Yeah, I want to talk to you.
- The other night at dinner.

01:17:25.473 --> 01:17:27.373
When you came back
and you sat down at the table

01:17:27.475 --> 01:17:31.275
and you said the Brodkeys' benefit.
I know why you want to go.

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.845
I know why you want to go.
Do you think I'm an idiot?

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:37.214
- No.
- You know what I do wonder?

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:41.415
If you still have feelings for her,
then why are you in this house?

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:44.455
Why are you still in this house?

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.723
Are you that selfish?

01:17:47.262 --> 01:17:49.230
To think that I would stay here with you
while you fucked her?

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:50.730
Is that what you're thinking?

01:17:50.832 --> 01:17:52.925
Do you ever think about anybody else
but yourself?

01:17:53.034 --> 01:17:56.629
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever think about your children?

01:17:56.738 --> 01:17:58.831
- Our children.
- Our children!

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:01.966
You did this for our children? For Graham?

01:18:02.143 --> 01:18:06.079
He's in college. He deals drugs.
And he thinks you're a joke.

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:09.374
- And Susan? Susan loathes you!
- That's not true.

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:11.611
Yes, that is very true!

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:16.921
For one time,
for one time in your goddamned life,

01:18:18.059 --> 01:18:20.118
be honest with me, William.

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:22.592
Did you ever love me?

01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:25.394
Did you ever love me?

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:29.300
- Tell me, did you ever love me...
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:18:29.804 --> 01:18:31.237
I don't know.

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:42.282
You were afraid you'd be lonely, is that it?

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:49.246
You were afraid you'd have to give me 50%
of everything you think you own, is that it?

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:51.791
No. That's not what this is about.

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:54.553
God.

01:18:59.034 --> 01:19:00.262
Oh, God.

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:21.819
I'll go to the benefit with you.

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:24.589
And we'll walk in there

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:28.725
and we'll wink and we'll wave
and we'll have drinks,

01:19:29.097 --> 01:19:32.066
and we'll let everybody
know we're just fine.

01:19:34.035 --> 01:19:36.526
And then you can come back home here

01:19:37.238 --> 01:19:40.264
and you can pack your things
and you can leave.

01:19:41.009 --> 01:19:44.069
So, yes,
I'll go to the Brodkey benefit with you.

01:19:47.515 --> 01:19:49.710
Why would you want to do that?

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.047
I want to see her.

01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:58.149
Hey!

01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:01.251
Where you been?

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:05.222
You weren't in the room.

01:20:07.502 --> 01:20:09.493
Tim, what's wrong? What happened?

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:12.763
What's wrong? Nothing's wrong.

01:20:16.644 --> 01:20:18.236
You want to talk?

01:20:23.284 --> 01:20:25.684
Did you just ask me if I want to talk?

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:27.448
Well, yeah.

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:30.185
Yeah. We could talk.

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:36.493
What? What are we gonna talk about, Dad?

01:20:37.298 --> 01:20:40.233
I don't know. You tell me.

01:20:43.671 --> 01:20:45.036
There's nothing to talk about.

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:47.404
Please... Please, Tim, come on.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.704
There's nothing to talk about.

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:52.369
Come on. Give me a chance.

01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:55.673
Don't ruin my chances.

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:58.753
You don't have any chances left
to ruin, dude.

01:21:03.324 --> 01:21:05.724
Come on, Tim, you don't mean that.

01:21:09.964 --> 01:21:11.522
There's nothing.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.968
There's nothing. Just accept it.

01:21:15.937 --> 01:21:18.497
It's easier that way. Just forget it.

01:21:19.974 --> 01:21:22.272
There's nothing you can tell me,

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.103
and there's nothing
I'm going to tell you, Dad,

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:27.579
that's gonna make any difference.

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:51.834
Some fucking blond kid came by the house.

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:54.004
Yeah, what did he say?

01:21:54.809 --> 01:21:57.039
- He was asking me about a package.
- Yeah?

01:21:57.145 --> 01:21:59.010
Did you give it to him?

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.646
No, I told him we didn't have it.

01:22:05.753 --> 01:22:06.811
What?

01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:12.056
- What did Dirk say?
- What? You know his fucking name?

01:22:17.298 --> 01:22:19.232
What did Dirk say, Jack?

01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:23.762
- He said he'd be back.
- Fuck!

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:27.171
They're gonna kill us!
They're gonna kill us!

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:28.401
Who the fuck are these people?

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:31.035
I think it would be in our best interest
if you get your shit

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:32.545
and we get the fuck out of here, okay?

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:34.842
I told you.
I told you we shouldn't have come here.

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:36.314
Shut the fuck up, Mary!

01:22:36.417 --> 01:22:38.146
Just get your shit
and let's get out of here, okay?

01:22:38.253 --> 01:22:39.720
No, it's not my fucking problem.

01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:42.312
I got a fucking job.
I can't just fucking pack up and move.

01:22:42.423 --> 01:22:45.256
You don't know
what they're capable of, okay?

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.592
You ain't got a goddamn clue.
They're like out of a fucking nightmare.

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:53.167
So get your shit together
and let's get the fuck out of here.

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:54.735
Come on, Mary!

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:22.223
What are you doing?

01:23:25.066 --> 01:23:28.797
Listen, if we leave the kid here
and they find him,

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:34.338
this is a more humane way
than letting them get their hands on him.

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:36.342
Let me do it.

01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:41.038
Let you do what?

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:45.609
- Let you do what?
- I'll handle it.

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:48.080
How are you gonna handle it?

01:23:49.757 --> 01:23:52.123
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

01:23:53.661 --> 01:23:55.686
Get the fucking van ready.

01:23:59.434 --> 01:24:00.901
Come on, Mary.

01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:57.679
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!

01:26:43.664 --> 01:26:46.861
Clean yourself. Just clean yourself up.

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:29.007
- Hello?
- Yes, hello, I'm looking for Graham.

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:32.072
- Yeah?
- Graham, it's Nina Metro.

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.943
- I'm calling about...
- Who?

01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:37.017
We've actually got an emergency
with Christie.

01:27:37.151 --> 01:27:39.517
I was hoping you could come down.

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:02.236
- Hello, can I help you?
- Hi.

01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:08.644
- I'm Graham.
- You're Graham?

01:28:09.016 --> 01:28:10.074
Yeah.

01:28:12.286 --> 01:28:13.913
She's really sick.

01:28:14.121 --> 01:28:18.683
She needs to see a doctor, but she's
so stubborn, we can't talk her into it.

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:24.692
- Well, where's her dad?
- He's on location in ltaly.

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:31.403
- That's an answer?
- She needs help, Graham.

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:37.471
- Why do you think I can help her?
- Well, aren't you the one that loves her?

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:46.950
What's that gonna fix?

01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:50.154
Is that gonna help her?

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:11.969
Hey.

01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:26.824
What are you trying to tell me, baby?
What are you saying?

01:29:30.665 --> 01:29:31.893
I want...

01:29:34.835 --> 01:29:36.325
I want to stay.

01:29:39.707 --> 01:29:41.538
But it's getting cold.

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:44.439
But I need more sun.

01:29:56.023 --> 01:29:57.752
There's no more sun.
