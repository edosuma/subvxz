He made a mistake.

00:23.425 --> 00:24.799

Here I'm thinking that my
parents' marriage is the thing.

00:27.091 --> 00:28.300
That doesn't make you stupid.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.050

off what Cameron just said,

07:01.300 --> 07:03.841
you really did explain
your market thesis well.

07:03.841 --> 07:05.467

we fucked up our friendship.

07:31.924 --> 07:34.758
Well, you literally
fucked your friend,
so that sounds about right.

07:34.758 --> 07:37.342
- Tsk.
- How they still
doing the estimate?

07:37.342 --> 07:39.008

Duh.

07:39.008 --> 07:40.550
Do we even need it?

07:40.550 --> 07:42.716
How are we supposed
to go back to normal
after this?

07:42.716 --> 07:45.966
Dro is the one
nigga in my life
that's seen me at my worst.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.091
Girl, he took me to prom
back when I was wearing
all pink

07:48.091 --> 07:49.550

in "Check On It."

07:49.550 --> 07:52.716
- Ooh, I bet
that looked cute.
- It did.

07:52.716 --> 07:55.883
But, like, no matter what,
he was always there for me.

07:55.883 --> 07:58.467
I just don't have
another friend like that.

07:58.467 --> 08:00.799
Um, hello,
I'm right here.

08:00.799 --> 08:03.425
- We can fuck
if you want to.
- Tsk, shut your ass up.

08:05.133 --> 08:07.258
You know what?

08:07.258 --> 08:10.467
I'm just gonna tell him
that I value our friendship

08:10.467 --> 08:13.091
and it was a onetime thing,
and I was all emotional

08:13.091 --> 08:14.758
after all the shit
that happened with my parents,

08:14.758 --> 08:19.216
and we should just
move forward as homies.

08:19.216 --> 08:21.592

this deep-ass
conversation?

08:21.592 --> 08:23.133

to watch the game.

08:23.133 --> 08:25.924
- What game?
- Like you know sports.

08:25.924 --> 08:27.550
The Los Angeles
Wheelers.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.592
Oh, yeah.
I have a hat.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.258
Mm-hmm, do you?

08:31.258 --> 08:32.799
Yeah, it got
wheels on it.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.592
Ms. Dee,
we're gonna have to
order some parts,

08:34.592 --> 08:36.091
and we're looking
at a couple weeks.

08:36.091 --> 08:38.592
And the estimate
is $5,500.

08:38.592 --> 08:39.674
55-what?!

08:39.674 --> 08:40.966
You don't got
that kind of money.

08:40.966 --> 08:42.799
I know!
I'm poor!

08:45.091 --> 08:47.799
- ( sighs )
- I can give you a ride.

08:47.799 --> 08:48.841
You have to.

08:50.342 --> 08:52.175
Molly:
And, girl, maybe
if it's not Morocco,

08:52.175 --> 08:53.966
we could still
go to Miami

08:53.966 --> 08:56.716
or Montego Bay
or Monterey.

08:56.716 --> 08:59.841
There are other places
that start with
other letters.

08:59.841 --> 09:03.883
I'm just, ugh--
I was just getting
everything under control,

09:03.883 --> 09:06.508
and I'm just... ugh!

09:06.508 --> 09:08.300
Girl, I know,
this car shit sucks.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.924
Remember when I got
that flat tire?

09:09.924 --> 09:12.300
I mean, I just paid for it
and kept it moving, but--

09:12.300 --> 09:14.175
And the niggas
ain't even acting right.

09:14.175 --> 09:15.758
It's like,
it's my hotation.

09:15.758 --> 09:17.050
I make the rules.

09:17.050 --> 09:19.508
So when I call you,
bring over the dick!

09:19.508 --> 09:23.175
- So, what's the problem?
- Why do these niggas even
need to fuck anybody else?

09:23.175 --> 09:25.841
Like, I mean, granted,
I know I'm not Rihanna.

09:25.841 --> 09:27.799
You know, sex with me
isn't amazing,

09:27.799 --> 09:32.175
but it is like,
"Huh. Okay, yeah,
I'm satisfied.

09:32.175 --> 09:35.133
I'd do that again
with her."

09:35.133 --> 09:37.633
But aren't you fucking
other people, too?

09:37.633 --> 09:39.050
Barely.

09:39.050 --> 09:41.924
You know where
I fucked up? Nico.

09:41.924 --> 09:44.383
'Cause he distracted me
with his fine-ass face.

09:44.383 --> 09:45.924
But I'ma tell him,
"Shut the fuck up.

09:45.924 --> 09:47.175
I don't want
your conversation.

09:47.175 --> 09:48.633
Get in my lineup."

09:48.633 --> 09:51.008
- Girl, that's
the ho spirit.
- Mm-hmm.

09:51.008 --> 09:53.674
Molly:
Oh, maybe you can
pick up some toys

09:53.674 --> 09:55.216
at Tiffany's thing.

09:55.216 --> 09:56.758
Spice your shit up.

09:56.758 --> 09:58.716

- Stupid-ass name.
- Right?!

10:00.467 --> 10:03.300
- Don't it sound
like an STD?
- It do!

10:03.300 --> 10:05.050
Welcome.
Can I take your order?

10:05.050 --> 10:07.799
Hi! Can I have a double
cheeseburger meal, please?

10:07.799 --> 10:09.383
And get whatever
you want, girl.

10:09.383 --> 10:11.716
It's on you.

10:11.716 --> 10:14.550
So, am I crazy,

10:14.550 --> 10:16.966
or did that go
kind of great?

10:16.966 --> 10:20.674
What do you think
I should tweak before
my next step?

10:20.674 --> 10:23.883
Uh, your expectations.

10:23.883 --> 10:25.633
( scoffs )
Wait, what?

10:25.633 --> 10:27.883
I'm sorry,
but if I'm just
being honest,

10:27.883 --> 10:29.592
I don't think
Woot Woot is viable.

10:31.050 --> 10:32.425
Based on what?

10:32.425 --> 10:36.841
It just felt
outdated.

10:36.841 --> 10:39.425
I mean, it's cool
if you don't see
the vision.

10:39.425 --> 10:41.758
Good thing you're not
the one greenlighting it.

10:41.758 --> 10:43.342
Okay.

10:43.342 --> 10:46.258
I'm just saying
I know when they're
into something.

10:46.258 --> 10:48.716
Like with the Saddle pitch,
they asked questions,

10:48.716 --> 10:52.674
they poked holes,
they even scheduled
a follow-up.

10:52.674 --> 10:55.674
It's weird.
It's like they didn't
wanna offend you.

10:55.674 --> 10:57.758
You're entitled
to your opinion.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.592
( chatter )

11:03.592 --> 11:05.508
( sighs )

11:05.508 --> 11:08.924
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Oh, you didn't miss shit.

11:08.924 --> 11:11.342
Randle like a damn bull
in a china shop.

11:11.342 --> 11:13.508
- Huh.
- Like, nigga,
calm your body.

11:13.508 --> 11:15.050
- Hmm.
- Whatever.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.467
Magic gotta do
something.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.300
- You want a beer?
- No, I'm good.

11:18.300 --> 11:21.550
- All right, well,
I ordered you fries.
- Thank you.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.966
- Um...
- Mmm.

11:23.966 --> 11:25.966
What's up, Mo?
You okay?

11:27.508 --> 11:29.300
( sighs )

11:29.300 --> 11:31.633
I'm just feeling like
we're different now.

11:31.633 --> 11:35.175
( laughs )
What?

11:35.175 --> 11:36.592
Different?

11:36.592 --> 11:38.258
Different how?
You just got here.

11:38.258 --> 11:39.841
Okay, first of all,
stop laughing at me.

11:39.841 --> 11:42.133
- Stop being dramatic.
- I'm not being dramatic.

11:42.133 --> 11:44.633
You're being dramatic and dumb.
Just eat your fries.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.966
Where the fuck
are they?

11:47.966 --> 11:50.633
Shit, you was late.
I had a few.

11:50.633 --> 11:53.716
- I like the crispy ones.
- Those are the ones I like.

11:53.716 --> 11:55.758
So, basically,
you just got these
for you?

11:58.674 --> 11:59.550
Nah.

12:00.924 --> 12:02.175

12:02.175 --> 12:03.508

Um, sorry, I've been
running around all day

12:27.175 --> 12:28.716
and I'm not
quite ready.

12:28.716 --> 12:30.508
But do you wanna
sit down?

12:30.508 --> 12:31.841
Sure.
Thanks.

12:35.508 --> 12:38.467
Um, the skirt that
I was gonna wear
is in the dryer,

12:38.467 --> 12:40.008
so it'll just be
a few minutes.

12:40.008 --> 12:42.550
I mean, I-- I like
the one that you have on.

12:42.550 --> 12:44.674
This? No way.
It barely fits.

12:44.674 --> 12:46.216
And it's so short.

12:46.216 --> 12:47.924
- Isn't it too short?
- ( both chuckling )

12:47.924 --> 12:49.716
I don't know.
I kind of like it.

12:49.716 --> 12:52.633
Well, too bad because
it's coming off in a second.

12:52.633 --> 12:55.216
- Wine?
- Well, can't say no to that.

12:58.091 --> 12:59.841
- Mmm.
- I like your place.

13:01.550 --> 13:03.508

13:03.508 --> 13:05.883
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

13:11.216 --> 13:13.592
Do you taste
the stone fruit?

13:13.592 --> 13:15.841
Actually, um, I do.

13:15.841 --> 13:18.883
There's hella
stone fruit in there.

13:18.883 --> 13:20.550
Uh, let me play
some music.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.091
And I downloaded that album
we were talking about.

13:23.091 --> 13:26.091
- Mmm.
- ( music playing on phone )

13:26.091 --> 13:29.133
( volume increases )

13:31.008 --> 13:32.883
Hey, that was
a cool trick.

13:38.633 --> 13:40.758
( singer vocalizing )

13:44.300 --> 13:46.342
That was nice,
but, um,

13:46.342 --> 13:49.550
I think that
maybe we should
probably go to dinner.

13:49.550 --> 13:51.091
Oh, we don't
have to.

13:51.091 --> 13:52.383
I-- mm...

13:53.550 --> 13:55.008
Mm, wait.

13:55.008 --> 13:58.258
Hey, sweetie.
Sweetie, slow down.

13:58.258 --> 13:59.924
What? Why?

13:59.924 --> 14:02.841
I just-- I just don't think
that we should do this yet.

14:02.841 --> 14:05.300
Oh, are you okay?
Is anything wrong

14:05.300 --> 14:07.841
with your...
just anything?

14:07.841 --> 14:09.799
What? Oh, no.
( chuckles )

14:09.799 --> 14:11.508
No, it's...

14:11.508 --> 14:12.966
Look,
I really like you,

14:12.966 --> 14:16.674
and I don't want us
to rush past this,
you know?

14:16.674 --> 14:19.799
I-- I wanna
get to know you.

14:19.799 --> 14:21.425
Yeah, I got it.
Mm-hmm.

14:23.799 --> 14:26.008
Okay.

14:26.008 --> 14:29.425
So, do you wanna get
to the restaurant?

14:30.674 --> 14:32.091
No.

a few hours ago

14:51.133 --> 14:55.674
you saying that
this supposed to be
a onetime thing.

14:55.674 --> 14:58.008
- I said that?
- Mm-hmm.

14:58.008 --> 15:01.550
Right before we made it
a fourtime thing.

15:01.550 --> 15:04.050
( chuckles )
Fuck.

15:06.008 --> 15:07.383
Fuck.

15:09.508 --> 15:12.674
Hey, so, how would
this even work?

15:12.674 --> 15:16.216
Like,
this whole open thing
sounds super messy.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.924
Like, if you're seeing me,
are you seeing other people?

15:18.924 --> 15:20.425
Mm-mm, no,
I don't have to.

15:20.425 --> 15:23.342
- But do you want to?
- No, not right now.

15:23.342 --> 15:25.091
- I'm worn out.
- Tsk.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.258
( both chuckling )

15:27.258 --> 15:29.550
I'm not looking
for anyone else, Molly.

15:29.550 --> 15:31.799
Okay,
but what if I am?

15:31.799 --> 15:33.258
What if I wanna
see other people?

15:33.258 --> 15:35.425
Then you gotta do
what you want.

15:37.550 --> 15:39.716
Are there
other Mollys out there

15:39.716 --> 15:41.091
that you've been with
like that?

15:41.091 --> 15:42.716
I've only been
with one Molly

15:42.716 --> 15:45.216
that I've been with
like that.

15:45.216 --> 15:48.758
But if you're asking
if I've slept with
other women, then...

15:50.091 --> 15:51.216
come on.

15:51.216 --> 15:53.425
Tsk, okay,
calm down, nigga.

15:56.050 --> 15:58.716
Wait, does Candice
know about all this?

15:58.716 --> 16:01.716
Of course she does.
It was actually her idea
we see other people.

16:01.716 --> 16:03.633
Damn.

16:03.633 --> 16:06.175
( sighs )
That's kind of boss.

16:06.175 --> 16:07.924
( chuckles )

16:07.924 --> 16:11.050
She never wanted
either of us to feel like
we're limiting ourselves.

16:20.592 --> 16:22.592
We could keep
talking about this...

16:22.592 --> 16:24.091
( kisses )

16:24.091 --> 16:25.633
...or choose
to be in it.

16:27.592 --> 16:30.258
- What do you want?
- ( sighs )

16:47.342 --> 16:48.924
- ( knocks )
- What's up, Lawrence?

16:48.924 --> 16:50.508
What can we do
for you?

16:50.508 --> 16:52.799
Oh, just thought
I'd swing by,
see what's up.

16:52.799 --> 16:57.467
See if you guys
had any feedback
about my Woot Woot pitch.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.300
Yeah, I know the part
in the presentation

16:59.300 --> 17:01.050
about my front user
implementation

17:01.050 --> 17:03.758
wasn't as fully fleshed out
as I would have hoped,

17:03.758 --> 17:06.758
but I had some
additional ideas

17:06.758 --> 17:08.133
that I would love
to share with you guys.

17:08.133 --> 17:09.633
No, we thought
that part was good.

17:09.633 --> 17:13.300
Yeah, there was some really
interesting stuff in there.

17:15.758 --> 17:20.550
So, you guys don't have
any additional thoughts?

17:20.550 --> 17:22.716
If anything, maybe
some privacy concerns,

17:22.716 --> 17:25.258
but take it
or leave it.

17:25.258 --> 17:27.467
Oh, okay.

17:27.467 --> 17:29.799
Uh, good to know.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.091
We really want
to encourage you

17:33.091 --> 17:34.841
to keep the ideas
coming.

17:34.841 --> 17:38.758
We love having
your perspective
and your energy around here.

17:38.758 --> 17:42.258
And you bring
a lot to the team.
You're doing great.

17:42.258 --> 17:44.966
We can't wait
for Lawrence 2.0.

17:44.966 --> 17:46.883
( all chuckling )

17:50.091 --> 17:51.592
Sounds good.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.841
And those sneakers
you had on the other day,

17:53.841 --> 17:55.799
what store did you
get those from again?

17:55.799 --> 17:59.633
It's a spot downtown
called Nice Kicks.

17:59.633 --> 18:00.633
And those are.

18:01.841 --> 18:03.716

- Oh, look, they give
blow job tutorials.

Good Job" class.

18:39.592 --> 18:41.050
Runs every 30 minutes.

18:41.050 --> 18:42.841
Sign-up's
right here.

18:42.841 --> 18:45.674
Who puts a condom on
when you're giving
a blow job?

18:45.674 --> 18:48.674
That's like
eating a popsicle
with the wrapper on.

18:50.550 --> 18:52.592
No, but I only fellate
with protection.

18:52.592 --> 18:54.300
- Condoms are important.
- Keep dicks safe.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.966
- Okay.
- We're signing up.

18:55.966 --> 18:58.674
- Great.
- Or I could just
teach the class myself.

18:58.674 --> 19:01.216
Okay, Tiff,
you got it like that?

19:01.216 --> 19:02.550
I love it.

19:02.550 --> 19:04.133
I mean,
Derek loves it more, obvi,

19:04.133 --> 19:05.425
but I am stellar.

19:05.425 --> 19:06.883
Well,
I don't suck dick.

19:06.883 --> 19:08.966
Ever since Jaleel White--
not the famous one--

19:08.966 --> 19:10.633
and his musty balls
in the 11th grade,

19:10.633 --> 19:12.300
never again,
not this mouth.

19:12.300 --> 19:14.216
Yeah, I don't really
partake either.

19:14.216 --> 19:17.550
I have big teeth,
and, honestly, I'm not
the best at it.

19:17.550 --> 19:19.841
Exactly why
I signed us up.

19:19.841 --> 19:22.592
Plus,
the whole eye contact
and the spitting,

19:22.592 --> 19:24.633
it's just
too intimate.

19:24.633 --> 19:27.258
Like, I have to
really fuck with you
to put your dick in my mouth.

19:27.258 --> 19:29.425
But you don't mind if a guy
puts his dick in you?

19:29.425 --> 19:32.091
- ( vocalizing "I don't know" )
- I just don't understand
black women

19:32.091 --> 19:33.758
and their hang-ups
about oral sex.

19:33.758 --> 19:35.508
Girl, shut your
light-skinned ass up.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.550
- ( hisses )
- I just feel like

19:37.550 --> 19:40.799
guys see black women
as disposable after
you give them head.

19:40.799 --> 19:42.799
Like you're forever a ho
if you do it.

19:42.799 --> 19:44.550
- Oh, so I'm the ho
in this situation?
- Mm-hmm.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.924
I blame the church,
the black church.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.674
Kelli, you can't use that
for everything.

19:48.674 --> 19:50.841
- Yes, I can.
- You know, I don't mind
giving head.

19:50.841 --> 19:53.799
I don't lead with it,
but if you go down
on me first,

19:53.799 --> 19:55.799
I will return
the favor.

19:55.799 --> 19:59.633
- Ladies, I'm so
disappointed in you.
- Bitch, shut up.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.592
You went to
those all-white-girl
private schools,

20:01.592 --> 20:03.592
so you're
brain-washed, Becky.

20:03.592 --> 20:05.467
You mean,
"Becky With the Good Ring"?

20:05.467 --> 20:08.674
Yeah, why do you think
black men are out here
chasing after white women?

20:08.674 --> 20:10.966
Did you know David Oyelowo
is with a white woman?

20:10.966 --> 20:13.383
Mm! And he was
in "Selma."

20:13.383 --> 20:15.467
I'm just saying,

20:15.467 --> 20:18.008
there is so much power
in giving blow jobs.

20:18.008 --> 20:20.799
It's like I'm the one
fully in control.

20:20.799 --> 20:22.342
How are you
in control?

20:22.342 --> 20:24.258
Every man is controlled
by his dick.

20:24.258 --> 20:26.175
The closer you get to it,
the more control you have.

20:26.175 --> 20:29.592
And if you're good at it,
sky's the limit.

20:29.592 --> 20:31.216
Kelli:
Honestly, I'd rather
go down on a woman.

20:31.216 --> 20:32.841
At least our shit
cleans itself.

20:32.841 --> 20:35.633
Hey, why are there two?
Got it. I'm gonna get it.

No, she didn't!
Oh, no.

20:48.592 --> 20:50.508
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:50.508 --> 20:53.883
So, um,
Woot Woot's dead.

20:53.883 --> 20:55.342
( sighs )

20:56.633 --> 20:58.883
I'm sorry.
What happened?

20:58.883 --> 21:01.467
I went to talk
to Cameron and Tim,

21:01.467 --> 21:04.216
and you were right,
they were super weird.

21:04.216 --> 21:05.674
They clearly
didn't like it,

21:05.674 --> 21:09.383
but they just
couldn't say it
to a black dude.

21:09.383 --> 21:10.883
Is that what it is?

21:10.883 --> 21:13.216
They asked about
my shoes twice.

21:13.216 --> 21:14.716
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

21:14.716 --> 21:16.342
You know,
I had a feeling
it was something.

21:16.342 --> 21:19.216
And they're also
really weird around these.

21:19.216 --> 21:21.050
- ( chuckles )
- ( scoffs )

21:21.050 --> 21:23.133
I mean, I don't know,
deep down I kind of thought

21:23.133 --> 21:25.216
Woot Woot
might not still be...

21:25.216 --> 21:29.091
I don't know,
it just-- it had been
a part of my life for so long.

21:29.091 --> 21:32.050
No, I get it.
I was working on this app

21:32.050 --> 21:35.008
that was supposed to
rival Uber and Lyft.

21:35.008 --> 21:37.841
- I called it Drive-By.
- Drive-By?

21:37.841 --> 21:40.050
- Yeah, I didn't really
think that one through.
- No.

21:40.050 --> 21:41.799
( both chuckle )

21:41.799 --> 21:43.592
But it's okay.

21:43.592 --> 21:46.799
Sometimes saying goodbye
means you're making room
for something better.

21:46.799 --> 21:48.841
Yeah.

21:48.841 --> 21:53.592
Yeah, I guess
I'll look forward
to being Lawrence 2.0.

21:53.592 --> 21:55.050
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

21:55.050 --> 21:56.592
I'm at Aparna 6.7.

22:00.924 --> 22:02.758
Yo, let's
run this back.

22:02.758 --> 22:05.050
Did people get shot
using your Drive-By app?

22:05.050 --> 22:07.966
How many owls got harmed
in the making of Woot Woot?

22:07.966 --> 22:09.674
( imitates machine gun )
Was that, like, your ringer?

22:09.674 --> 22:11.841
- Like...

22:11.841 --> 22:13.716
