00:09.092 --> 00:10.172
Hey.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.340
BERINGER:
Hey, I'll be right there.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.043
Take your time.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.712
You mind if I get
a drink of water?

00:15.807 --> 00:17.934
No, no. Not at all,
help yourself.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.187
(BERINGER CHUCKLING)

00:32.282 --> 00:34.614
Not exactly
beach reading, huh?

00:35.118 --> 00:36.369
Do you understand
any of that stuff?

00:36.453 --> 00:37.738
Well, most of these
I can get through.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.696
But that one, I can't
get past the dust jacket.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.372
Where's Ted?
Laid off.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.824
Company's going
with per diem workers.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.331
You don't have
to pay overtime,
health insurance.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.706
Wow, that sucks.

00:47.798 --> 00:51.632
I don't mind. Really.
I'm not a 40-hour-a-week
kind of guy.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.549
Uh, if I could just
get you to sign...

00:56.640 --> 00:58.130
Right. Um...

00:59.476 --> 01:02.513
Hang on one second.
I wanna show you something.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.219
(BERINGER LAUGHING)

01:04.314 --> 01:05.815
(COUGHING)

01:06.024 --> 01:07.434
You're gonna laugh,

01:07.526 --> 01:11.144
but I swear this guy,
James Sidas,
looks exactly like you.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.730
Wait, hang on a second.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.530
This guy is you.
I saw a profile
Nova did on you.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.408
You're like
the youngest guy
to ever graduate MIT.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.080
Standards were
lower back then.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.577
You got an IQ of 178.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.876
Published three books
and 35 papers,

01:27.963 --> 01:29.794
all before
the age of 18?

01:29.881 --> 01:31.041
Yeah.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.290
Sorry, I really
need to get going,

01:33.385 --> 01:34.750
so if I could just
get you to sign off...

01:34.845 --> 01:38.508
All right. l'll trade you.
I'll sign if you'll sign.

01:38.724 --> 01:39.930
I'm not that guy
any more.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.757
Come on, man.
This is the most
exciting thing

01:41.852 --> 01:44.468
that's happened
in this place in years.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.561
(LAUGHING) Come on,
don't be like that.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.487
l'm paying you
a compliment.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.363
It's not that. I'm...

02:01.705 --> 02:02.945
My hand's not working.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.873
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa. You okay?

02:08.670 --> 02:09.705
No.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.159
$2.32.
Put it on
Dr. Wilson's tab.

02:51.254 --> 02:54.496
I don't know who
Dr. Wilson is,
and we don't have tabs.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.172
Do you know who I am?

02:56.259 --> 02:57.715
No.
Good.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.505
But, sir...

02:59.596 --> 03:01.587
I got it.
It's all right.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.465
Thanks.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.550
Although,
I should make it clear
that for two bucks,

03:06.645 --> 03:08.727
all you get is top half,
over the clothes.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.020
(LAUGHS)

03:10.107 --> 03:12.143
Any plans
for turkey day?

03:12.234 --> 03:15.067
Going to my sister's
for dinner. Why?

03:15.362 --> 03:16.943
Just making
pleasant conversation.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.986
I heard tell of
folks doing such.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.315
How about we
talk about this?

03:21.410 --> 03:24.322
Fifteen-year-old,
recurring migraines
and blurred vision.

03:24.413 --> 03:25.573
Great.
Really?

03:25.664 --> 03:27.700
Sure. There's no point
putting a band together

03:27.791 --> 03:29.156
ifwe're not
gonna play any gigs.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.833
Hold on.
Take this instead.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.706
l was expecting
more resistance.

03:33.797 --> 03:37.631
That was the old me.
New me is static guarded
and friction free.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.549
Enjoy your drumstick.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.757
Ready to
save some lives?

03:47.394 --> 03:51.387
Thirty-two-year-old courier,
ataxia, anemia, mild cough.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.142
CT was clear,
tox screen negative.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.019
What are you
so excited about?

03:55.110 --> 03:57.021
Why wouldn't I be?
Got all my starters back,

03:57.112 --> 04:01.151
plus a couple of
first-class free agents.
I feel like Mike Tomlin.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.236
Probably not
as much as you do,
but you get the idea.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.069
Ataxia and anemia,
could be viral,
maybe West Nile.

04:07.164 --> 04:11.032
No fever,
lymph glands were normal.
Anybody seen Wilson?

04:11.126 --> 04:12.241
Hyperbilirubinemia?

04:12.335 --> 04:14.417
Yeah, like that's
a real thing.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.493
Meningitis.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.045
Anemia's a stretch.

Page Dr. James Wilson
at 558.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.840
TAUB: What about
sickle cell?

04:20.927 --> 04:22.383
The guy's white.
Whites can get it.

04:22.471 --> 04:25.087
Come on. We get
the tennis elbow
and all the money,

04:25.182 --> 04:26.262
let them have
sickle cell.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.600
TTP is a better fit.

04:27.684 --> 04:28.924
He's right.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.931
What, you thought
I wouldn't agree
with him? Ever?

04:36.026 --> 04:37.106
Well, you didn't
agree with him.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.776
That's why he dumped you.
Oh, sorry, it was mutual.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.104
We're cool, okay?
Nobody's angry,
nobody's hurt.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.564
HOUSE: Sounds passionate.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.032
(CLEARS THROAT)
TTP makes sense to me.
Not to me.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.108
What if he had
a history of...

04:47.204 --> 04:50.116
One big happy family.
TTP it is.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.703
Confirm with a blood smear
and ADAMTS13 antibodies.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.706
WOMAN ON PA:
Dr. James Wilson,
please dial 558.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.582
Can you cure it?

04:58.673 --> 05:00.129
TTP isn't
completely curable,

05:00.217 --> 05:02.549
but the symptoms
are manageable with
the proper treatment.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.796
Is this the treatment?

05:03.887 --> 05:06.128
No. First we need
to do a blood test
to confirm the diagnosis.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.303
But he's gonna
get better?

05:07.390 --> 05:08.766
SlDAS: Honey,
that's what she's saying.

05:08.850 --> 05:09.965
I'm gonna be okay.
Don't worry.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.176
How can't I worry?
You're in the hospital.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.806
I'm gonna be fine.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.138
Are you sure everything
was fine before?

05:16.233 --> 05:17.723
I mean, given your
educational background,

05:17.818 --> 05:20.104
you'd think you could
at least find a job
with a medical plan.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.651
We have money.
Don't worry.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.818
TAUB: It'S not that.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.487
It's just I want
to make sure

05:24.574 --> 05:26.280
we have all
the information we should.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.608
My husband wouldn't lie.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.658
It's okay, baby.
He's just doing his job.

05:29.746 --> 05:34.115
He just wants to make sure
I'm not a secret drug addict
or an alcoholic.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.996
Or hiding a history
of mental illness.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.334
I work as a courier
because I want to.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.675
It's easy.
I don't have to think.

05:42.759 --> 05:43.874
It's too hard to think?

05:43.969 --> 05:45.960
No. Just unpleasant.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.929
No matter what I did,
it really wasn't
good enough.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.131
Then I met Dara.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.432
She didn't care
how smart I was,

05:52.519 --> 05:55.010
or what I might accomplish
in the future.

05:55.105 --> 05:58.472
It was the first time
in my life that
l was really happy.

05:58.567 --> 06:02.105
So I decided
I would rather be
happy than smart.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.113
(DOOR OPENS)

06:13.707 --> 06:15.288
You all right?

06:16.126 --> 06:19.084

not okay. I mean...

06:20.213 --> 06:21.544
Sheleﬁ.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.959
Went back to Chicago.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.427
Any chance of
reconciliation?

06:26.678 --> 06:27.793
No.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.803
You sure you don't wanna
grab a drink after work?

06:30.891 --> 06:33.007
I figured we could talk
about the perils
of dating doctors.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.466
I wasn't dating Cameron.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.550
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

06:35.645 --> 06:38.728
I know what you're doing,
and I appreciate it.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.976
But I've got it
under control.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.058
That's what you said
about the Dibala incident,

06:43.153 --> 06:44.984
and obviously you didn't.

06:45.071 --> 06:48.609
And talking about it
obviously made things
so much better.

06:53.997 --> 06:57.034
Didn't you think
there was something
weird about that guy?

06:57.125 --> 06:59.537
Not really. In fact,
he seemed pretty normal.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.243
That's my point.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.953
Guys with le
off the chart

07:03.048 --> 07:05.755
are usually
completely abnormal.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.928
Speaking of House,
why did you come back?

07:09.012 --> 07:10.502
I mean, you must have
taken a major pay cut.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.007
Life's too short
to worry about money.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.258
Your wife feel
the same way?

07:13.350 --> 07:16.217
She's happy to cut back
on some things.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.721
Like sex.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.263
Why'd you come back?
Why wouldn't I?

07:21.358 --> 07:24.816
Like Foreman said,
nobody's angry,
nobody's hurt.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.018
Schistocytes.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.607
That means TTP.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.859
Which is what we thought
it'd be, remember?
This is a good thing.

07:30.951 --> 07:34.034
This is an easy thing,
and House doesn't take
cases that are easy,

07:34.162 --> 07:35.743
which means
it's not TTP.

07:35.830 --> 07:39.197
And he wants to see
how long it takes us
to catch up to him.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.289
Schistocytes
suggest TTP.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.121
Good, now what?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.081
Normally we'd try
plasmapheresis,

07:48.176 --> 07:50.292
but the patient has
an albumin colloid
allergy.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.467
So?

07:51.554 --> 07:53.636
So that means
we have to give him
a splenectomy.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.304
Yes, it does.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.230
Wilson?
MAN: No.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.484
Do you know
where he is?

08:12.575 --> 08:13.655
Not in here.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.608
You're sure you want us
to take out his spleen?

08:15.704 --> 08:16.864
Is that what
a splenectomy is?

08:16.955 --> 08:19.116
I thought it was
an ice cream treat.
Yuck.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.947
So you do really
think he has TTP.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.157
You're not
just testing us.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.743
Yeah. Like I have
time for games.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.334
So, why did you
really take this case?

08:28.425 --> 08:31.633
Isn't it obvious?
l'm fishing for
a dinner invite.

And lunch.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.432
I had
a dentist appointment.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.688
You know where
Cuddy's sister lives?

08:49.779 --> 08:53.112
You see, this is why
I don't answer

not urgent pages.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.988
I've decided
what I'm gonna do
about Cuddy and Lucas.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.455
I'm going to
break them up.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.076
Of course.
It's given me
a purpose in life,

09:02.167 --> 09:04.453
a goal,
a raison d'etre.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.412
Albeit a selfish,
mean-spirited,
childish raison.

09:08.506 --> 09:11.088
I think of it
more as benevolent.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.800
There's only two
possible outcomes
for their relationship,

09:13.887 --> 09:16.048
they split or they
stay together forever.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.755
If it's split,
then the sooner it happens,
the better for everyone.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.091
If it's stay,
then my meddling
won't matter.

it might even make
their bond stronger.

elevate your narcissism

09:29.069 --> 09:31.902

is masterful.

And I've decided to do it
at Thanksgiving dinner,

09:35.950 --> 09:37.690
just 'cause
I'm sentimental.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.868
Dinner's at Cuddy's sister's,
which brings us back to...

09:39.954 --> 09:41.615
House, don't.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.994

Cuddy wasn't biting,
so I'll have to crash.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.997
l have no idea where
Cuddy's sister lives.

shalt receive.

I would help you with this.

Not help me,
help Cuddy, remember?

I'll be forced to use
more nefarious methods.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.630
Green and orange

10:35.635 --> 10:37.171
and ceiling.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.465
Mr. Sidas, do you know
where you are?
Chewing.

10:39.556 --> 10:40.636
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

10:40.723 --> 10:41.712
Jimmy?

10:41.808 --> 10:42.797
Shirt.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.679
He's stroking.
Call the cath lab, now!

10:45.770 --> 10:47.010
Oh, my God.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.942
Blood flow's restored,
appears to be
no permanent damage.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.280
Good news is
it turns out
to be an exciting,

10:56.364 --> 10:58.571
action-packed thrill ride
of a case after all.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.400
Bad news is we took out
his spleen for nothing.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.906
Thank God he's still got
his appendix and tonsils.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.660
So what looks like TTP,
acts like TTP,

11:07.750 --> 11:10.241
(DIALING)
tests like TTP,
but isn't TTP?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.793
CNS Vasculitis,
explains the ataxia

11:12.881 --> 11:14.166
and anemia,
maybe the stroke.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.713
CT would have
picked up something.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.008
Hi, I'm Greg House.
I'm a friend of
your sister, Lisa.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.551
Could be DIC.

11:20.638 --> 11:21.969
Lisa Cuddy.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.637
HOUSE: Sorry,
wrong number.
You gonna ask?

11:23.725 --> 11:25.681
I'm sure he's got
a perfectly
logical explanation.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.850
Can't be DIC,
no hemorrhaging.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.519
And I'm calling
all 12 Julia Cuddys
within 100-mile radius.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.642
(DIALING)

11:31.733 --> 11:34.975
See?
Completely reasonable.
Acquired pancytopenia?

11:35.069 --> 11:36.104
WBC's normal.

11:36.196 --> 11:40.485
Hey, Julia. You're
Lisa's sister, right?

11:41.075 --> 11:43.407
Are you sure?
You are number 12.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.780
Maybe she got married
and changed her name.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.237
Otis Campbell.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.663
Probably kept
her first name.

11:48.750 --> 11:49.865
FOREMAN:
The mnemonic for toxins.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.666
"O" for organophosphates,
"T" for tricyclics,
"I" for insulin...

11:52.754 --> 11:55.245
Or as I remember it,
"Moist Place."

11:55.340 --> 11:57.752
That's "Place" spelled
with two "L"s
and a silent "l3.”

11:57.842 --> 11:59.127
Except the tox screen
was negative.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.585
Standard tox screen.
Unstandard toxins
don't show up on it.

12:01.679 --> 12:05.092
Well, you two do
an unstandard tox screen.
You two search his home.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.845
Otis Campbell's gotta
be hiding somewhere.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.142
Smartest guy
in the world

12:10.230 --> 12:11.970
and this is
the best he can do?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.646
Maybe he's doing
what he loves.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.270
Delivering boxes
was a childhood dream.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.440
Soda, processed cheese,
marshmallow spread.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.111
Nothing in here is
capable of going bad.

12:21.199 --> 12:24.908
Ibuprofen, eye drops,
cough syrup.

12:25.787 --> 12:28.995
You want to come over
for Thanksgiving dinner?

12:30.667 --> 12:32.749
You never asked me
over before, why now?

12:32.835 --> 12:36.453
Just never thought of it.
But now that we're
both on the team...

12:36.547 --> 12:38.538
And my wife left me?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.087
Is that a bad reason?

12:42.178 --> 12:44.464
No, but I'm okay.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.597
On both the food
and friends.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.140
TAUB: Mice.

12:49.227 --> 12:52.685
Leptospirosis could explain
the ataxia and the anemia.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.888
But not
without a fever.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.144
You have someone
to talk to?

12:57.235 --> 12:58.691
Yeah.
Who?

13:00.655 --> 13:02.145
What, you want names?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.856
Look, you lost a friend,
I get it.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.066
But I'm not Kutner.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.652
Good. 'Cause Kutner
never used to
come over for dinner.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.992
I'm going to pretend
there's something
interesting over here,

13:12.083 --> 13:13.744
so you'll shut up.

13:25.263 --> 13:30.508
Actually, there is.
He's got sketches
of atomic structure.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.018
This one is full
of math proofs.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.847
They're all old.
Nothing since '96.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.522
This isn't some
homework assignment

13:38.609 --> 13:40.861
his parents
forced on him,

13:40.945 --> 13:44.688
this is passion.
Why would he want
to stop doing this?

13:44.782 --> 13:47.114
Marriage destroyed
his soul?

13:59.422 --> 14:00.537
Ooh.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.875
Or maybe it was
just the booze.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.672
Thank you, Doctor.
You've been wonderful.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.553
As have you, Diana.
Be well.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.099
DIANA: Thank you.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.977
You're helping.
Voluntarily.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.316
He's done six already.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.015
I figured you might
be getting backed up

14:21.110 --> 14:22.395
with the holiday season
and all.

14:22.487 --> 14:26.025
So which one of us
slipped through the wormhole
into an alternate dimension?

14:26.115 --> 14:29.073
I have always loved
to travel. And paint.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.195
Lucky number seven.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.652
House, I know
you're trying
to be nice.

14:32.747 --> 14:35.830
But I also know
you're doing it because
you have an agenda.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.203
Wow. Sexy and smart.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.283
(CLICKING TONGUE)

14:39.379 --> 14:40.539
Lucas is a lucky guy.

14:40.630 --> 14:44.669
The question is,
is this a bad agenda
or a good one?

14:45.051 --> 14:47.758
Either you're trying
to screw with me,

14:47.845 --> 14:51.463
or you're trying to show me
that you've really changed.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.017
So which is it?
I'm dying to know.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.478
What are you doing
for Thanksgiving dinner?

15:08.199 --> 15:09.985
Peace in our time!

15:11.202 --> 15:13.989
Only cost me 45 minutes
of clinic duty.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.947
This is a three-hour drive.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.784
Have you considered
the possibility that
this is a fake address?

15:20.878 --> 15:23.995
You think she'd
send me to a vacant lot
for Thanksgiving dinner?

15:24.090 --> 15:26.046
If she's smart.
She is.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.092
That's why I ran it
through Motor Vehicles.
Good as gold.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.715
This cannot end well.

15:31.806 --> 15:35.469
Don't want it to end well.
You should come as my date.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.426
You're not gonna want
to miss this.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.351
The unstandard
tox screen

15:43.443 --> 15:45.024
was as clean
as the standard one.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.069
But we found
vodka stashed away
in his place.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.692
What's with the ties?

15:51.409 --> 15:56.028
Makes me look
adorably non-threatening.
Party or party-hearty?

15:56.122 --> 15:58.534
Liver failure would
explain all the symptoms.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.245
Party.

16:04.213 --> 16:09.048
So, the guy's a brainiac
and his secret drug
of choice is booze?

16:09.135 --> 16:11.000
It's kind of pedestrian,
don't you think?

16:11.095 --> 16:12.676
Talk to him,
he's a pedestrian guy.

16:12.763 --> 16:16.347
With pedestrian alcoholism.
Liver biopsy can wait
until after Thanksgiving.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.140
Yes, assuming the biopsy

16:18.227 --> 16:20.263
is going to
tell us exactly what
we expect it to tell us,

16:20.354 --> 16:21.890
it can wait till
after New Years.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.519
On the other hand,
Taub and Thirteen can do
the liver biopsy today.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.725
Why us?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.980
Juniority.
Welcome back.

16:29.947 --> 16:30.982
What do you
want us to do?

16:31.073 --> 16:34.281
Same as me.
Have a happy Thanksgiving.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.278
I'm not an alcoholic.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.205
Yes, you just hide vodka
around the house for fun.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.499
I drink,
just not a lot.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.451
Since when do you
drink at all?

16:46.547 --> 16:48.879
I have one shot when
I get home from work, baby.
That's it.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.376
So why lie to
your wife about it?

16:50.468 --> 16:52.174
SlDAS: Because
it's not important.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.296
What difference
does it make?

16:53.387 --> 16:55.639
That you drink every day,
by yourself?

16:55.723 --> 16:58.305
l have one lousy drink,
okay?

16:58.392 --> 16:59.552
Have you ever
seen me drunk? Ever?

16:59.644 --> 17:02.556
No, but you've obviously
been drinking enough
to hurt your liver.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.603
My liver is fine.
Hold still.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.945
There we go.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.815
This test is
a waste of time.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.870
(EXCLAIMING)

17:24.961 --> 17:26.667
Hey.
This wine?

17:36.013 --> 17:39.676
All right. Very good.
There, we got this...

17:49.986 --> 17:51.726
(LAUGHING)

18:03.374 --> 18:04.363

18:04.458 --> 18:05.868
No, I'm the house sitter.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.746
They're in Hawaii
for the week.

18:16.721 --> 18:17.710
Happy Thanksgiving.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.420
Happy Thanksgiving,
you guys.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.504
Happy Thanksgiving.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.680
DOUGLAS: Cheers. Cheers.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.970
You must be Dr. House.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.894
I was told
I should offer you
a turkey sandwich.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.111
Tuna salad.
Closest thing they had
to turkey.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.197
Thanks.
But I'm hoping I can
still get out of here

18:46.292 --> 18:48.157
and catch the tail end
of dinner with my wife.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.241
Anything?

18:49.337 --> 18:51.419
No cirrhosis, no scarring,
no infection.

18:51.505 --> 18:54.247
Blood panel?
Elevated albumin, 7.2.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.217
That's it?
Everything else is fine.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.465
So it was
a waste of time.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.631
Unless,
it's not his liver

19:03.726 --> 19:06.638
that's elevating
his albumin,
it's his kidneys.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.435
Renal failure.
Explains the anemia.

19:08.522 --> 19:09.898
If he developed
hyperkalemia,

19:09.982 --> 19:12.815
that would
explain the ataxia,
but the stroke...

19:12.902 --> 19:14.642
Ischemic encephalopathy.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.071
Nice.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.947
Except now we have to stay
and test his kidneys.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.830
(KEYS JINGLING)

19:33.297 --> 19:35.162
Key under the mat.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.292
There's no key
under the mat.

19:36.384 --> 19:37.590
Oh, right.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.628
You need to
replace one of
your kitchen windows.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.763
I helped myself to
your wine cellar.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.681
I'll leave a buck
on the way out.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.059
You're not right for her.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.226
And you are?

19:50.314 --> 19:51.690
Less wrong.

19:51.774 --> 19:52.763
Ah.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.935
But then
I started thinking...

20:02.034 --> 20:03.319
What was I saying?

20:03.411 --> 20:05.777
You were saying
it's late and...

20:05.871 --> 20:09.705
She invited me.
She didn't know
if she should.

20:09.792 --> 20:13.876
She was trying to figure out
if I really have changed

20:15.047 --> 20:19.165
or if I'm still
the same old SOB
I've always been.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.681
But she always
gave me a chance.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.888
Eight hundred and
thirty-two chances,

20:29.979 --> 20:32.140
and I used up
every one of them.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.644
Eight hundred and
thirty-two's her limit,
make a note.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.274
How about
a cup of coffee?

20:41.699 --> 20:43.030
It's just instant, but...

20:43.117 --> 20:44.323
(BOTTLE CLINKING)

20:50.583 --> 20:52.119
I'm pathetic.

20:57.006 --> 21:00.089
Okay. Okay.

I love her.

Patient's liver is fine,
it's his kidneys
that are shot.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.487
And where the hell
is House?

21:23.574 --> 21:26.065
He left
a message on the machine.
He's not coming in today.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.616
CHASE: So what causes
kidney failure?

21:27.703 --> 21:28.738
Rhabdomyolysis.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.035
No edema.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.204
I trust you had
a wonderful Thanksgiving.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.328
I don't remember.
So I guess I did.

No bone pain.

No. That would
be a sign

21:41.091 --> 21:43.127
that I need to talk
to you about this.

Polycystic kidney disease.

No UTls or flank pain.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.969
Well, what if his cough
is more than just a cold?

21:51.060 --> 21:53.142
He hasn't been coughing.
It's in his history,

21:53.229 --> 21:55.436
and we found a new
bottle of cough syrup
in his medicine cabinet.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.013
Cough could mean
Goodpasture Syndrome,

21:57.107 --> 21:58.722
affects kidneys
andlungs.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.934
Start him on
immunosuppressors
and dialysis.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.609
We'll do it right after
we run it by House.

answering his pager.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.490
Looks like he's
leaving it up to us.

we don't disagree,

22:08.911 --> 22:11.243

it was his spleen,

it was his liver,

22:29.431 --> 22:30.807

it wasn't,

it'd be better

seeing each other.

I actually felt bad
about scamming you,

but then you lived down
to my expectations,
and then some.

He wasn't taking it
for his cough.

It's cheap, available
at your corner drugstore,

it's a dumb drug.

It's not fun any more.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.270
Just do yourjob.

33:55.909 --> 33:57.365
(DOOR OPENS)

33:58.662 --> 33:59.697
(DOOR CLOSES)

34:06.419 --> 34:08.034
I need your help.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.958
What happened
to your face?

34:11.258 --> 34:14.216
I was mowing the lawn
when the phone rang.

34:14.302 --> 34:17.840
You're a computer.
I'm gonna feed you data,
and you analyze it.

34:17.931 --> 34:18.920
What are you
gonna feed me,

34:19.015 --> 34:20.801
20 years of
medical knowledge, too?

34:20.892 --> 34:23.133
It's not gonna work.

34:24.145 --> 34:27.683
I know. But I don't
have anyone else to ask.

34:31.736 --> 34:33.647
It's lonely, isn't it?

34:34.739 --> 34:36.525
It's not that bad.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.282
Then you're not
that smart.

34:40.537 --> 34:42.619
You ever try
to kill yourself?

34:42.706 --> 34:43.866
Not quickly.

34:43.957 --> 34:44.946
Idid.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.748
Twelve years ago,
I jumped off the top of
my eight-story building

34:47.836 --> 34:50.703
into a dumpster bin
the day before pick-up.

34:50.797 --> 34:55.757
I broke my collar bone,
my leg and three ribs.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.631
When I was in the hospital,
they put me on narcotics

34:58.722 --> 35:01.680
and suddenly
everything was just better.

35:02.601 --> 35:06.093
I didn't feel
isolated or lonely.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.856
That's where
I met my wife.

35:08.940 --> 35:13.900
She was so happy
and dumb.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.566
And I was

35:19.117 --> 35:23.030
smart and miserable.

35:23.788 --> 35:26.279
You tell me who
the genius is.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.787
I fell in love with her
buzzed out of my head

35:29.878 --> 35:33.211
and I knew I wanted to
stay that way forever.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.763
Enjoy.
(LAUGHS)

35:44.684 --> 35:47.596
Easier on your conscience
if I die an idiot?

35:48.521 --> 35:50.386
What's a conscience?

36:01.284 --> 36:05.527
Which ribs did you
break in the fall?
Down the left side?

36:05.622 --> 36:08.955
Yeah, bottom three.
But that was 12 years ago.

36:13.630 --> 36:17.293
This probably
cost me my marriage,
so it better be awesome.

36:17.384 --> 36:18.840
Ferrous oxide
contrast?

36:18.927 --> 36:21.964
It gets absorbed
by the spleen,

36:22.055 --> 36:23.591
unless he doesn't
have one,

36:23.682 --> 36:26.674
in which case it's
absorbed by the liver
and fries that.

36:26.768 --> 36:27.848
You're killing him?

36:27.936 --> 36:29.892
You think I opened him up
and didn't take
out his spleen?

36:29.979 --> 36:33.471
All organs do look
kind of the same,
red and squishy.

36:39.447 --> 36:40.778
THIRTEEN: Oh, my God.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.571
Accessory spleens.

36:42.659 --> 36:44.866
Okay, that is amazing.

36:44.953 --> 36:47.786
Twelve years,
eight stories
and a dumpster ago,

36:47.872 --> 36:50.158
he broke three ribs,
damaged his spleen.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.866
Bits of it split off,
circulated through
his blood stream

36:52.961 --> 36:54.997
until they landed and
attached somewhere else.

36:55.088 --> 36:58.046
So, it is TTP.

36:58.133 --> 37:02.251
I just didn't remove
all of his spleens.

37:02.345 --> 37:05.382
Sixteen splenectomies,

37:05.473 --> 37:07.964
pretty sure he gets
a set of steak knives
with that.

37:18.862 --> 37:20.602
I can outrun you.

37:24.576 --> 37:28.990
Sorry about the nose.
And the eye.
And the eyebrow.

37:31.124 --> 37:32.204
Guess I deserved it.

37:32.292 --> 37:35.079
Well, if I thought that,
I wouldn't be apologizing.

37:35.170 --> 37:37.456
Your fist slipped?

37:37.547 --> 37:40.835
Everybody kept bugging me,
asking if I was okay.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.426
So you bust my nose
to keep people
off your back?

37:48.975 --> 37:50.055
Pretty much.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.929
Making people even more
worried about you.

37:52.020 --> 37:55.512
Maybe. But at least
they're not talking
to me about it.

37:57.734 --> 37:59.349
Fair enough.

37:59.444 --> 38:00.729
Cheers.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.526
SlDAS: Thank you.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.862
HOUSE: Don't be so grateful.

38:11.956 --> 38:15.494
You'll be
delivering packages for
70 years to pay for it.

38:15.752 --> 38:19.085
Well, thanks for our talk.

38:19.172 --> 38:22.289
It's been a while since I had
a stimulating conversation.

38:22.383 --> 38:23.418
So what are you
going to do?

38:23.510 --> 38:25.125
Go back to my life.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.426
Which one?

38:27.096 --> 38:29.007
The one that
has my wife in it.

38:31.184 --> 38:32.720
TAUB: Robotripping.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.517
How does she feel
about that?

38:34.604 --> 38:38.142
Well,
she doesn't have to know.
It's worked for 12 years.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.650
Tell your brain
I said goodbye.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.832
Einstein's giving
himself a lobotomy,

38:57.919 --> 38:59.705
and you're cool
with that?

39:02.006 --> 39:03.746
Ignorance is bliss.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.048
Hold that pose.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.592
(CLICKING)

39:14.269 --> 39:18.228
I'll start with
t-shirts and mugs
and see how it goes.

39:26.447 --> 39:27.948
Home early.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.447
RACHEL:
What happened to him?

39:37.542 --> 39:38.873
You beat up House?

39:38.960 --> 39:40.871
Just one right hook.

39:40.962 --> 39:41.951
Why? What happened?

39:42.046 --> 39:43.035
You were right.

39:43.131 --> 39:46.373
I told him we need to
lay down some ground rules,
it got a little heated.

39:46.467 --> 39:50.460
That's not what I meant.
Is he okay?

39:50.555 --> 39:52.341
Are you going to
be fired? Arrested?

39:52.432 --> 39:54.138
Everything's fine.

39:56.102 --> 39:57.308
Wow.

40:16.039 --> 40:17.370
Dr. Cuddy.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.912
Can we at least be civil?

40:26.090 --> 40:27.705
How's your nose?

40:28.426 --> 40:30.087
It's okay.

40:30.178 --> 40:32.510
Does your kid
like animals?

40:32.597 --> 40:34.588
I got tickets to
that holiday carnival.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.173
I hear they have
a nice petting zoo.

40:38.019 --> 40:39.930
I think I was
pretty clear before.

40:40.021 --> 40:41.761
I don't mean with me.

40:42.649 --> 40:45.516
Here. Take them.
Enjoy.

40:46.569 --> 40:47.945
No, thanks.

40:49.697 --> 40:52.609
They're not fake.
I didn't steal them.

40:52.700 --> 40:56.067
One of the nurses
was selling them
for her kid's scout troop.

40:56.162 --> 40:57.618
I know
it doesn't make things
right between us,

40:57.705 --> 41:00.447
but I just wanted
to do something nice.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.201
I don't want them.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.383
Okay.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.212
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.266
They didn't split up.

41:24.691 --> 41:26.898
She wouldn't
take the tickets.

41:27.402 --> 41:31.395
Of course.
Windtalker code for
"we never split up."

41:31.489 --> 41:33.104
House, she told you
multiple times

41:33.199 --> 41:34.735
she wants nothing
to do with you.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.987
I wasn't gonna be there.

41:37.078 --> 41:41.242
She just felt guilty
that I felt guilty,
so she couldn't take them.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.827
Either that or she didn't
want to appease you.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.829
These weren't reparations,

41:45.920 --> 41:50.038
just a simple
gesture of remorse,
and she slapped it down.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.915
They didn't break up.

41:53.553 --> 41:56.420
She just wanted me
to think that,
so I'd back off.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.928
Dare I ask what
you're gonna do?

42:03.354 --> 42:04.594
Nothing.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.681
I said they'd
either break up
or they'd stay together.

42:07.775 --> 42:09.731
They didn't break up.

42:11.195 --> 42:13.277
And you're okay
with that?

42:14.032 --> 42:15.693
It is what it is.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.367
Good for you.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.531
(GROANING)

42:29.547 --> 42:31.287
House knows I lied.

42:31.382 --> 42:32.713
Why? What did he say?

42:33.551 --> 42:35.382
Nothing.
I could just tell.

42:35.470 --> 42:36.835
You gonna stage
another breakup?

42:36.929 --> 42:38.135
No.

42:38.514 --> 42:39.629
Oh.

42:40.141 --> 42:41.301
Hi.

42:41.809 --> 42:44.721
It seems like he's
going to leave us alone.

42:44.812 --> 42:47.303
Mmm. Why would he do that?

42:47.398 --> 42:48.979
I'm not completely sure.

42:50.485 --> 42:53.977
So, we have his blessing?

42:55.156 --> 42:56.487
I guess so.

42:56.574 --> 42:59.111
I made you some
eggplant Parmesan.

42:59.786 --> 43:00.946
(BABY TALK)

43:02.121 --> 43:04.828
And maybe House
isn't so bad after all.

43:04.916 --> 43:06.156
(SIGHS)

43:07.460 --> 43:09.826
That would be nice,
wouldn't it?
