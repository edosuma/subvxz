Hey. Thanks for showing up
on such short notice.

12:05.210 --> 12:06.580
Of course.

12:06.580 --> 12:08.500
Look, Maryse, um...

12:08.500 --> 12:10.120
I need your help.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.420
With what, exactly?
You aren't thinking

12:12.420 --> 12:13.960
about buying this place are you?

12:13.960 --> 12:16.080
Oh, no. Not in this lifetime.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.290
But don't tell the realtor that.

12:17.290 --> 12:18.880
He lent me the keys
for the afternoon.

12:19.880 --> 12:23.330
So... you could break into
that warlock safe?

12:26.500 --> 12:29.580
Yeah. It might help us
track down Jonathan.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.750
Um... Jocelyn's
late friend Elliot,

12:31.750 --> 12:33.880
he used to own this place,
and he left instructions

12:33.880 --> 12:35.750
with Jocelyn on how
to open the safe

12:35.750 --> 12:37.080
in case of an emergency.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.120
Unfortunately...

12:39.880 --> 12:41.210
...they're in code.

12:41.210 --> 12:43.960
Ah... so, you called in

12:43.960 --> 12:46.120
the closest Circle code-weaver
you could find.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.790
I called in a friend
who I trust...

12:50.250 --> 12:51.580
...who just so happens to be

12:51.580 --> 12:53.290
the closest Circle code-weaver
that I could find.

12:56.290 --> 12:57.710
This is what he gave Jocelyn.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.250
Supposedly, this has the keys
to opening this thing.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.790
"Vis consili expers
mole ruit sua."

13:06.040 --> 13:08.960
"Force without wisdom
collapses from its own weight."

13:09.920 --> 13:11.380
Hmm. Maybe it's a...

13:11.380 --> 13:14.040
warning that the safe can't
be opened by brute force?

13:15.040 --> 13:17.170
What exactly do we
hope is inside?

13:17.170 --> 13:18.880
Well, Elliot kept
detailed records

13:18.880 --> 13:21.000
of every arcane item
in the Shadow World.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.920
Hopefully, the sword
that Jonathan's looking for

13:22.920 --> 13:25.080
is listed somewhere inside.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.670
We find the sword;
we can use it as bait.

13:28.670 --> 13:29.830
What are we standing around for?

13:31.080 --> 13:31.830
Let's get to work.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.000

13:46.460 --> 13:47.460
(SONOROUS VIBRATION)

13:47.460 --> 13:49.250
So, what's the sudden emergency?

13:50.250 --> 13:51.960
The hunt for Heidi's
gone horribly wrong.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.080
She killed a Praetor.
His name was Nick.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.580
We came up together.

13:58.580 --> 13:59.750
Trained together.

14:08.330 --> 14:09.540
Jordan, I'm sorry.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.880
Maybe it's time
to bring the Shadowhunters in.

14:13.880 --> 14:14.880
No.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.460
No, she's
the Praetor's jurisdiction.

14:18.460 --> 14:19.210
Why did you call me?

14:19.210 --> 14:20.880
She can't hurt you.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.210
I was hoping you'd
join our team.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.790
Act as our shield.

14:24.790 --> 14:28.080
But... I don't have
the Mark of Cain anymore.

14:29.210 --> 14:31.080
Wait, what?

14:31.080 --> 14:33.670
It's... it's a long,
complicated story.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.460
I met Cain. Strange dude.

14:35.460 --> 14:36.830
Not very approachable.
But he helped me

14:36.830 --> 14:38.500
get rid of the Mark
so now, I'm good.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.330
Well, you know what that means?

14:43.330 --> 14:45.420
Yeah, back to being normal...
for a vampire.

14:45.420 --> 14:47.750
No, you... you don't
need a Praetor.

14:47.750 --> 14:50.460
Not that I've been much help.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.830
The apartment's yours.
Rent's been paid

14:53.830 --> 14:54.710
'til the end of the year.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.790
I will come and grab my stuff
once we capture Heidi.

14:57.790 --> 14:59.120
OK?

15:01.120 --> 15:02.080
Wait.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.330
Heidi's my responsibility.

15:05.330 --> 15:06.580
Invincible or not...

15:07.790 --> 15:09.080
...I'm helping you
bring her down.

15:14.170 --> 15:16.210
(SIGHING) There has
to be a match.

15:16.210 --> 15:18.290
Listen, this could take a while.

15:18.290 --> 15:19.580
Why don't we get
something to eat?

15:19.580 --> 15:21.000
No, I'm fine. I'd rather wait.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.210
Clary, you've been going nonstop

15:24.210 --> 15:25.580
since you got back.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.000
You need to take a minute.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.540
I don't have a minute.

15:28.540 --> 15:30.040
(SIGHING)

15:30.040 --> 15:31.620
Hey.

15:31.620 --> 15:32.670
Listen.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.000
I thought I'd lost you.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.500
Forever.

15:38.420 --> 15:40.710
And now that I have you back,
all I want...

15:40.710 --> 15:42.120
is to stop.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.960
Just for a minute.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.620
And no Jonathan, no Lilith.

15:46.620 --> 15:47.960
Just you and me.

15:49.460 --> 15:50.920
I know, I just...

15:52.120 --> 15:53.830
As long as this thing
is still on me,

15:53.830 --> 15:55.330
it's never gonna be
just you and me.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.380
It's Jonathan too.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.750
Jace, you have
to remember. Please...

16:02.750 --> 16:04.000
Yeah, I'm trying.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.500
I was young. I was...
I was a kid.

16:09.210 --> 16:11.170
Well, if it's something
you learned at the Institute,

16:11.170 --> 16:12.170
it would be here.

16:15.330 --> 16:16.380
(SIGHING)

16:16.380 --> 16:18.670
But I didn't just study
at the Institute.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.620
We've been looking
in the wrong place.

the Morning Star case?

16:34.620 --> 16:37.040

from other weapons masters.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.120
How is ¿Sentry Greenlaw
helping?

16:43.620 --> 16:45.330
There is something
I need to tell you.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.830
(SIGHING)

16:52.880 --> 16:54.210
You can tell me anything.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.420
Remember those rumours
about the Downworld prisoners

16:58.420 --> 16:59.620
that were being tortured?

16:59.620 --> 17:01.380
Yeah, the ones Consul Penhallow

17:01.380 --> 17:03.000
categorically denied?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.830
Well, I contacted the guards

17:04.830 --> 17:07.210
that escorted the Seelie Knight
back to Idris.

17:07.210 --> 17:08.880
And one of them replied.

17:10.460 --> 17:11.710
Thomas Greenlaw?

17:11.710 --> 17:13.210
He says he can tell me
what's really going on

17:13.210 --> 17:15.750
at the Gard...
and he wants to meet.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.540
When?
Tonight.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.120
I'm leaving now.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.460
I'm coming with you.

17:30.670 --> 17:32.040

17:32.040 --> 17:33.290
I like to snack.

17:33.290 --> 17:34.960
(SCOFFING)

17:35.920 --> 17:37.120
What's in it?

17:38.920 --> 17:40.210
It's candy. That...

17:40.210 --> 17:42.250
It's in the name "candy bar."

17:43.420 --> 17:45.000
Magnus told you, didn't he?

17:46.210 --> 17:47.620
You know, next time
you're trying to help me

17:47.620 --> 17:48.620
with venom cravings...

17:49.620 --> 17:50.880
...no coconut.

17:52.460 --> 17:53.460
Look, why didn't you tell me?

17:54.710 --> 17:55.710
Because I...

17:57.040 --> 17:58.330
I didn't want you to look at me

17:58.330 --> 18:00.250
the way you're
looking at me now.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.250
Like what?

18:02.380 --> 18:03.540
Like I'm weak.

half as strong as you

to let my guard down.

OK, look. I...

18:23.920 --> 18:25.420
I did some reading

18:25.420 --> 18:27.290
about those mundane groups
you go to.

heard all that before.

he was the smartest person

20:06.580 --> 20:09.250

when Ollie disappeared.

a whole file on me

dating back
to the Demonic Murders.

I can't imagine your pack's
too happy about that.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.670
really put things
into perspective.

No matter how much I lost...

20:30.250 --> 20:32.540
I still have her. She's family.

takes a backseat.

than tap out again,

rip my throat out first.

everyone to back you.

but to stand down.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.170
so Heavenly Fire
could stay hidden.

36:28.170 --> 36:29.500
They killed one of their own.
