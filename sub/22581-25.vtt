00:04.086 --> 00:08.048
Captain's personal log,
February 18th, 2152.

00:08.257 --> 00:11.051
It took a while,
but we finally made it to Risa.

00:11.259 --> 00:13.386
With any luck, this will be
my last log entry

00:13.636 --> 00:15.721
for the next two days.

00:19.974 --> 00:21.975
If anything happens,
you know where to reach me.

00:22.893 --> 00:24.852
I don't anticipate any problems.

00:25.102 --> 00:28.396
Well, it's the problems
you don't anticipate.

00:28.605 --> 00:31.983
The crew is trained
to handle emergencies.

00:33.025 --> 00:37.737
But I'll alert you immediately
if there are any problems.

00:38.446 --> 00:40.572
This doesn't feel right.

00:41.072 --> 00:43.324
I shouldn't be going down
to some pleasure planet

00:43.532 --> 00:45.159
while half the crew
has to stay onboard.

00:45.367 --> 00:46.577
Everyone drew lots.

00:46.785 --> 00:48.369
You had the same chance
as the others.

00:48.578 --> 00:50.996
All the same,
the crew should come first.

00:51.204 --> 00:55.041
Captain, you need a vacation.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.225 --> 01:21.310
I'm glad you decided
to take some time off, sir.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.645
Wouldn't miss it.

01:24.937 --> 01:26.647
Do you wanna take the helm,
captain?

01:26.856 --> 01:29.065
I'm on vacation.

01:29.274 --> 01:30.817
Thanks.

01:32.568 --> 01:35.029
Enjoy yourselves.

01:36.904 --> 01:38.489
I'll bring you a souvenir.

01:49.622 --> 01:54.939
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:57.420 --> 02:00.839
"It's been a long time"

02:01.047 --> 02:04.883
"But my time is finally near"

02:05.092 --> 02:09.344
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

02:09.553 --> 02:12.472
"I will touch the sky"

02:12.680 --> 02:16.474
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

02:16.683 --> 02:19.686
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

02:19.894 --> 02:24.605
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

02:24.814 --> 02:27.732
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

02:27.941 --> 02:32.528
"I've got faith to believe"

02:32.736 --> 02:35.321
"I can do anything"

02:35.530 --> 02:40.033
"I've got strength of the soul"

02:40.242 --> 02:43.119
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

02:43.327 --> 02:48.665
"I can reach any star"

02:49.040 --> 02:52.793
"I've got faith"

02:53.001 --> 02:56.713
"I've got faith"

02:56.921 --> 03:01.715
"Faith of the heart"

03:17.394 --> 03:19.853
Everyone have big plans?

03:20.271 --> 03:21.313
Travis?

03:21.522 --> 03:23.065
Rock climbing, sir.

03:23.315 --> 03:24.607
There's a place called Galartha.

03:24.816 --> 03:27.651
The cliff face changes pitch
while you climb it.

03:27.901 --> 03:29.194
That sounds kind of dangerous.

03:29.695 --> 03:31.404
Well, if it's easy, what's the point?

03:31.612 --> 03:33.406
Just watch yourself.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.782
Malcolm?

03:35.990 --> 03:39.660
Well, supposedly Risa's
very cosmopolitan.

03:39.868 --> 03:42.787
There are species visiting
from all over.

03:43.037 --> 03:47.165
Malcolm and I plan to broaden
our cultural horizons.

03:48.708 --> 03:50.751
Is that all you two think about?

03:51.001 --> 03:53.378
Well, how we choose to relax
is our own business.

03:55.505 --> 03:57.256
You watch yourselves too.

03:58.632 --> 04:02.176
I plan on doing something
constructive with my time.

04:02.385 --> 04:05.470
I have been relying on the
universal translator far too much.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.681
Before I left Earth,
I learned 38 languages.

04:07.931 --> 04:10.557
Now all I do is push a button,
and the computer does all the work.

04:11.016 --> 04:12.350
Isn't that what it's for?

04:12.558 --> 04:16.603
Not this time.
I left my translator on Enterprise.

04:16.812 --> 04:18.980
You only have two days, Hoshi.

04:19.231 --> 04:22.483
If you wanna waste your time
talking to people...

04:25.235 --> 04:26.486
What about you, captain?

04:27.319 --> 04:29.655
I've never been much for vacations.

04:29.863 --> 04:31.864
But I've got a little villa
overlooking the ocean,

04:32.073 --> 04:35.700
and Porthos and I are going to relax.

04:37.827 --> 04:39.453
How long will this last?

04:39.662 --> 04:42.330
I usually require six days per year,

04:42.538 --> 04:45.832
but two should leave me
sufficiently refreshed.

04:46.083 --> 04:49.585
I've adjusted the dosage
to wake you up in exactly 48 hours.

04:49.794 --> 04:50.961
And if someone should require

04:51.212 --> 04:53.379
medical attention
during your hibernation?

04:53.797 --> 04:55.924
Crewman Cutler is a capable medic.

04:56.132 --> 04:57.633
I know where the bandages are.

04:58.300 --> 05:01.511
You can always wake me,
if you need to. But please...

05:01.719 --> 05:03.471
...only if it's an emergency.

05:12.310 --> 05:15.520
Well, to bed.

05:18.482 --> 05:21.067
Pleasant dreams, doctor.

05:54.382 --> 05:56.467
What do you think, Porthos?

05:57.009 --> 05:58.719
Not bad.

07:04.808 --> 07:07.060
Come here, let's go.

07:07.268 --> 07:09.395
What are you barking at?

07:38.624 --> 07:40.334
What about that one?

07:40.543 --> 07:43.962
Now I know you've been cooped up
on a starship for too long.

07:44.170 --> 07:45.254
What's wrong with her?

07:45.462 --> 07:47.339
Well, nothing, I suppose.

07:47.548 --> 07:50.717
I just wouldn't know
which eyes to look into.

07:52.259 --> 07:54.011
Hey, hey, hey.

07:54.219 --> 07:56.846
Now, she's interesting.

07:57.054 --> 08:00.306
I don't think "she"
is the right pronoun.

08:01.683 --> 08:04.309
But if you think it's worth the risk.

08:04.518 --> 08:07.770
I don't know. Maybe I should've
brought my scanner with me.

08:10.022 --> 08:11.857
Thank you.

08:16.527 --> 08:18.695
That's a she.

08:19.571 --> 08:21.155
What shall we drink to?

08:21.364 --> 08:22.906
To us.

08:23.115 --> 08:29.577
And to a well-earned
two days and two nights.

09:08.356 --> 09:10.565
How did you get up here?

09:11.024 --> 09:12.818
Stop it, you two.

09:13.276 --> 09:14.443
Porthos.

09:16.445 --> 09:17.904
Come in.

09:31.790 --> 09:35.042
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I think my dog is on your deck.

09:35.834 --> 09:37.293
Please.

09:42.631 --> 09:44.757
There you are.

09:50.011 --> 09:52.554
- I hope she didn't hurt...
- Porthos.

09:52.846 --> 09:54.723
Hello, Porthos.

09:54.931 --> 09:56.265
She's been cooped up for weeks.

09:56.474 --> 09:58.892
I should've known she'd run off
the first chance she got.

09:59.476 --> 10:00.894
No harm done.

10:01.103 --> 10:03.229
She probably just came over
to make a friend.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.317
- I'm Jonathan.
- Keyla.

10:10.692 --> 10:12.611
So is this your first time to Risa?

10:12.861 --> 10:14.612
Yes. You?

10:14.820 --> 10:17.906
First time. My science officer
felt I needed to relax.

10:18.114 --> 10:23.869
So I decided to do some reading,
let Porthos run on the beach.

10:24.702 --> 10:27.330
You should always listen
to your science officer.

10:28.164 --> 10:30.499
She'd be the first to agree with you.

10:32.833 --> 10:36.169
I was about to go out for dinner.
Can you recommend a restaurant?

10:36.378 --> 10:38.630
There's this little boat
that sails into the bay

10:38.838 --> 10:41.006
every evening just after sunset.

10:41.215 --> 10:44.050
You wade out, and they serve seafood
right off the deck.

10:44.801 --> 10:46.344
Sounds great.

10:49.763 --> 10:52.598
Well. I'm sorry to disturb you.

10:52.806 --> 10:54.433
Thanks again.

10:59.394 --> 11:00.646
If you don't have other plans,

11:00.854 --> 11:03.272
maybe we could wade out
to that little boat together.

11:03.648 --> 11:05.358
You're not here
with your science officer?

11:05.899 --> 11:07.275
No.

11:08.109 --> 11:10.069
In that case...

11:10.611 --> 11:14.155
Oh, no, I'm sorry. I can't tonight.

11:15.948 --> 11:17.157
Just a thought.

11:17.866 --> 11:19.284
Tomorrow?

11:19.910 --> 11:21.160
I look forward to it.

11:21.619 --> 11:23.370
So do I.

11:23.621 --> 11:25.413
Goodbye, Porthos.

12:03.774 --> 12:05.567
Slowly, please.

13:24.291 --> 13:25.792
Ravis.

14:36.218 --> 14:38.553
That place up the street
looked pretty lively.

14:38.761 --> 14:42.013
Well, the Vulcan database said
no one leaves this club unhappy.

14:42.222 --> 14:43.765
How would the Vulcans know?

14:43.974 --> 14:46.267
They only mate
once every seven years.

14:46.684 --> 14:48.769
That's what they say.

14:49.019 --> 14:53.021
- Do you know something I don't?
- Come on, seven years?

14:53.230 --> 14:55.399
I doubt even T'Pol
could hold out that long.

14:55.607 --> 14:58.776
Oh, she's very disciplined.

14:58.984 --> 15:03.655
Malcolm, bearing 180.

15:03.863 --> 15:07.116
- What?
- Behind you.

15:10.493 --> 15:13.411
Anything in that database that could
help us get a conversation going?

15:13.662 --> 15:15.372
If you wanted to have
a cultural dialogue,

15:15.579 --> 15:17.748
you should've gone with Hoshi.

15:18.624 --> 15:19.958
Hello.

15:20.458 --> 15:22.252
Hello.

15:23.418 --> 15:26.963
I'm Dee'Ahn, and this is Latia.

15:27.171 --> 15:30.132
- I'm Trip.
- I'm Malcolm.

15:30.340 --> 15:33.176
Would you join us for a drink?

15:33.843 --> 15:37.012
We've been waiting for you to ask.

15:41.973 --> 15:43.558
Well, what would you like?

15:44.267 --> 15:46.685
These look good.

15:48.395 --> 15:51.564
Another round, please.

15:51.815 --> 15:53.148
So where are you two from?

15:53.398 --> 15:55.567
Our planet's called Earth.

15:55.817 --> 15:58.819
Earth? Never heard of it.

15:59.445 --> 16:02.906
We're sort of new
to the neighbourhood.

16:03.615 --> 16:08.743
Well, then we'll have to make sure that
your first visit to Risa is memorable.

16:24.171 --> 16:26.464
Jonathan.

16:32.802 --> 16:34.094
You're up late.

16:34.512 --> 16:36.472
Just looking at the stars.

16:36.889 --> 16:38.765
Don't you get enough of that
on your ship?

16:39.557 --> 16:40.892
Never.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.727
Will you show me
what you're looking at?

16:44.436 --> 16:45.686
Come on up.

16:53.108 --> 16:55.027
I wanted to thank you.

16:55.235 --> 16:57.904
The little boat with the seafood?
Best I've ever had.

16:58.112 --> 17:00.781
- I'm sorry you had to eat alone.
- No problem.

17:00.989 --> 17:05.659
I had a nice chat with a couple
from Vega Reticuli.

17:05.867 --> 17:09.704
It turns out it's their 300th
wedding anniversary.

17:09.913 --> 17:12.039
Well, they must have a lot of stories.

17:12.247 --> 17:14.665
You can't imagine.

17:18.127 --> 17:19.877
There it is.

17:20.712 --> 17:22.880
What am I looking for?

17:23.088 --> 17:25.214
See the bright blue star at the top?

17:26.049 --> 17:29.260
- Is that your sun?
- No. Look just below.

17:29.469 --> 17:31.762
The yellow one. Do you see it?

17:31.970 --> 17:33.263
It's so faint.

17:33.512 --> 17:35.806
Well, it's about 90 light years
from here.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.185
You're a long way from home.

17:40.435 --> 17:43.896
Actually, this is the farthest
any of my people have ever gone.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.105
You're an explorer.

17:46.314 --> 17:48.732
I wouldn't be surprised
if they're naming schools after you

17:48.940 --> 17:50.025
back on your world.

17:51.109 --> 17:54.278
Archer Elementary.
It has a nice ring to it.

17:57.655 --> 17:59.198
Can you show me
where you're from?

17:59.698 --> 18:02.409
Oh, I really don't have
a very good sense of direction.

18:02.618 --> 18:04.368
Oh, I'm sure it's not that bad.

18:04.577 --> 18:08.038
I got lost coming back
from the lobby today.

18:09.748 --> 18:14.917
Well, I can see
how that could happen.

18:15.293 --> 18:19.379
I mean, it's at least
100 metres from here.

18:19.588 --> 18:21.839
And all the villas look the same.

18:22.047 --> 18:24.133
You've just gotta notice
the subtle differences.

18:25.134 --> 18:26.843
Like the numbers on the doors.

18:27.093 --> 18:28.553
Now you're catching on.

18:31.096 --> 18:33.806
Give me a couple of hours,
I could have you navigating a starship.

18:36.142 --> 18:40.061
Why don't you start by telling me
about some of the places you've been.

18:40.270 --> 18:43.439
We'll get to the
starship navigation later.

18:51.445 --> 18:53.279
We only had a few hours of air left,

18:53.487 --> 18:55.697
so I jettisoned our engine
and blew it up.

18:55.905 --> 18:58.783
- Turned it into a rescue flare.
- It was my idea.

18:59.032 --> 19:02.327
Doesn't matter whose idea it was,
it worked.

19:02.578 --> 19:05.288
Why don't you tell them about the time
you saved Enterprise

19:05.496 --> 19:07.038
in your underwear.

19:07.497 --> 19:10.083
I saved the captain's life.

19:10.833 --> 19:12.793
I thought you were the captain.

19:14.502 --> 19:16.004
We rotate.

19:16.212 --> 19:18.338
He's captain next week.

19:20.632 --> 19:25.802
So, captains, have you seen
the subterranean gardens?

19:26.052 --> 19:27.303
Subterranean?

19:27.512 --> 19:29.972
All the plants that grow there
are luminescent.

19:30.180 --> 19:31.974
It's beautiful.

19:33.224 --> 19:35.935
Maybe you could show us.

19:50.195 --> 19:51.988
Through here.

19:53.573 --> 19:56.825
This is a strange way to get
to the garden.

19:57.033 --> 19:59.994
They're very secluded.

20:02.704 --> 20:08.667
So how much do starship captains
get paid on your world?

20:08.875 --> 20:10.000
Excuse me?

20:10.000 --> 20:10.626
Excuse me?

20:10.835 --> 20:13.170
What kind of valuables do you have?

20:15.547 --> 20:19.383
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

20:24.011 --> 20:26.179
There's definitely been
a misunderstanding.

20:36.353 --> 20:38.689
See what they have.

20:41.190 --> 20:43.150
I hope this isn't their mating ritual.

20:43.359 --> 20:45.276
Quiet.

20:49.488 --> 20:51.030
Nothing.

20:52.115 --> 20:55.117
Maybe they have something
back in their rooms.

20:55.325 --> 20:57.244
It's too risky.

20:57.452 --> 21:00.663
- Could sell their clothes.
- Listen.

21:00.871 --> 21:04.332
I bet we could make
some kind of a deal.

21:24.013 --> 21:25.263
Enterprise.

21:25.472 --> 21:27.182
It's Travis, sub-commander.

21:27.391 --> 21:29.517
Could you send a shuttlepod down?

21:29.725 --> 21:31.393
What's the problem, ensign?

21:31.602 --> 21:34.687
I had a little rock-climbing accident.

21:35.522 --> 21:36.814
Where are you?

21:37.022 --> 21:41.275
In the central hospital, but I really
wanna get back to Enterprise.

21:44.402 --> 21:46.946
The fun part is the way
the rock face changes.

21:47.488 --> 21:50.907
The problem is
the handholds change too.

21:52.867 --> 21:55.744
Why didn't you let them finish
treating you on the surface?

21:55.952 --> 21:57.788
Have you ever been
to an alien hospital?

21:57.995 --> 22:00.456
Yes. In San Francisco.

22:01.332 --> 22:03.958
Well, these people have never
treated a human before.

22:04.167 --> 22:05.918
I wanted my own doctor.

22:06.126 --> 22:08.962
- Where's Phlox?
- He's not available.

22:09.170 --> 22:10.755
What do you mean,
he's not available?

22:10.963 --> 22:13.423
He's sleeping.

22:13.632 --> 22:15.842
Well, wake him up.
He's got a patient.

22:16.301 --> 22:18.177
The doctor is hibernating.

22:18.552 --> 22:20.845
Hibernating? For how long?

22:21.054 --> 22:22.847
Just a couple of days.

22:23.514 --> 22:26.016
Don't worry.
I can handle a broken leg.

22:26.266 --> 22:29.018
He said he was having trouble
breathing when we were in the pod.

22:29.226 --> 22:31.103
Did they give you any medication?

22:31.312 --> 22:34.105
Just a hypospray for the pain.

22:34.731 --> 22:36.940
- Is something wrong?
- It's probably nothing.

22:37.149 --> 22:39.275
Let's get you to Sickbay.

23:05.252 --> 23:07.046
Morning.

23:08.464 --> 23:12.507
I don't know if it was those
Risan mai tais or getting shot,

23:12.716 --> 23:15.302
but my head's killing me.

23:15.510 --> 23:17.678
It's probably both.

23:17.887 --> 23:19.929
The sun's up.

23:20.138 --> 23:22.557
We've been down here all night.

23:23.475 --> 23:25.017
Great.

23:26.185 --> 23:29.020
Our shore leave's half over.

23:30.897 --> 23:34.691
Hey! We need some help down here!

23:36.817 --> 23:40.403
- Hello!
- I already tried it.

23:40.612 --> 23:42.696
Club's closed.

23:43.530 --> 23:48.075
I don't plan on spending our entire trip
tied up in a basement.

23:50.910 --> 23:54.955
The Vulcan database didn't mention
anything about crime.

23:56.665 --> 23:59.417
They said it was very rare.

23:59.625 --> 24:01.251
What?

24:01.460 --> 24:05.045
It had some warnings,
but I didn't think it'd be a problem.

24:05.254 --> 24:07.381
Wonderful.

24:07.590 --> 24:09.549
You think this is my fault.

24:09.757 --> 24:12.968
You were willing to follow
two strange aliens into a basement.

24:13.177 --> 24:14.887
Gorgeous aliens.

24:15.095 --> 24:17.221
Don't forget, they were gorgeous.

24:17.430 --> 24:21.516
- They were male.
- Not at first.

24:23.018 --> 24:26.103
I don't remember twisting your arm.

24:27.103 --> 24:29.022
If we don't make it
to the landing zone on time,

24:29.230 --> 24:32.774
they're gonna start scanning
for our bio-signs.

24:33.775 --> 24:37.236
Do you want the captain
to find us like this?

24:45.284 --> 24:48.202
I feel terrible.

24:49.828 --> 24:53.247
You're having a reaction
to the painkiller they gave you.

24:53.455 --> 24:55.249
What's his condition?

24:55.457 --> 24:58.167
The swelling gets any worse,
it could begin to constrict his airway.

24:58.585 --> 25:02.254
I've spoken to the hospital. They've
never heard of a reaction like this.

25:02.462 --> 25:04.880
But they're not familiar
with human physiology.

25:05.339 --> 25:07.842
I really think
we should wake up Dr Phlox.

25:22.769 --> 25:24.019
I'm sorry, I give up.

25:24.228 --> 25:26.771
I never thought that I'd hear
a language I couldn't learn.

25:26.980 --> 25:29.566
Don't feel bad.
You've only been trying for one day.

25:29.774 --> 25:32.442
It only took you one day
to pick up English.

25:32.693 --> 25:33.944
It is much simpler.

25:34.151 --> 25:37.280
And you are a very good...

25:38.905 --> 25:40.615
Teacher.

25:41.491 --> 25:42.741
What do you call this?

25:44.076 --> 25:46.619
We don't have anything
exactly like it.

25:46.828 --> 25:49.871
The closest thing would be
a strawberry.

25:50.706 --> 25:52.290
Strawberry.

25:52.998 --> 25:54.208
And this?

26:00.671 --> 26:02.673
It tastes like a kiwi.

26:05.258 --> 26:06.384
What?

26:07.093 --> 26:10.470
In my language, "kee'hwi" is...

26:11.346 --> 26:12.471
What?

26:13.597 --> 26:15.473
I don't know the word.

26:15.682 --> 26:19.059
- May I show you?
- Sure. Why not?

26:25.731 --> 26:27.023
Kiss.

26:27.232 --> 26:30.275
That's called a kiss.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.445
A kiss.

26:35.196 --> 26:38.990
There's a place
I was planning to go today.

26:39.199 --> 26:41.118
A steam pool.

26:41.325 --> 26:43.410
They say it's very...

26:43.619 --> 26:44.829
...relaxing.

26:45.370 --> 26:47.372
Would you like to go?

26:48.956 --> 26:50.415
Avec plaisir.

26:51.416 --> 26:53.209
That's French.

26:53.417 --> 26:55.461
What does it mean?

27:29.735 --> 27:31.487
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

27:31.695 --> 27:32.988
Come in.

27:33.197 --> 27:34.989
I thought we could take our dogs
to the beach,

27:35.198 --> 27:37.574
- if you don't have other plans.
- Sounds great.

27:37.783 --> 27:40.035
I've just ordered breakfast.
Would you like to join me?

27:40.243 --> 27:42.078
Certainly.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.663
- Juice?
- Please.

27:48.041 --> 27:50.209
What are you reading?

27:50.417 --> 27:53.252
It's a gift from my science officer.

27:53.461 --> 27:57.672
Her people think humans
are too controlled by their emotions.

27:58.381 --> 28:00.341
I knew there was a reason
I liked you.

28:02.885 --> 28:05.762
Seems like you know a lot about me.

28:05.970 --> 28:08.889
Where I'm from, what books I read.

28:09.097 --> 28:11.849
I don't even know your dog's name.

28:12.642 --> 28:14.434
It's Rhylo.

28:14.643 --> 28:18.063
I adopted her when she was a puppy.
Anything else?

28:18.312 --> 28:20.105
Everything else.

28:20.314 --> 28:22.315
What's your planet called?

28:22.523 --> 28:24.025
What do you do?

28:24.233 --> 28:25.859
Do you have a family?

28:28.862 --> 28:31.197
We've been having
such a wonderful time.

28:31.405 --> 28:33.281
I really don't wanna spoil it.

28:34.657 --> 28:35.950
How could you spoil it?

28:38.952 --> 28:41.412
I did have a family.

28:43.831 --> 28:45.874
They were killed.

28:47.417 --> 28:51.295
My parents, my brother,
my husband.

28:52.879 --> 28:54.130
I'm sorry.

28:55.256 --> 28:57.382
It was our own fault.

28:58.592 --> 29:00.676
We'd been warned
about the Suliban.

29:01.052 --> 29:03.928
We should've gotten out
while we had the chance.

29:04.596 --> 29:05.889
Suliban?

29:06.431 --> 29:08.140
You know about them?

29:09.516 --> 29:10.808
Yes.

29:17.647 --> 29:20.191
I'm not so sure this is a good idea.

29:20.441 --> 29:23.902
There's no need to whisper.
He's in a state of deep hibernation.

29:24.402 --> 29:27.321
Yeah, that's what I'm worried about.

29:33.908 --> 29:36.202
Did you use the correct dosage?

29:41.330 --> 29:42.623
Phlox?

29:44.249 --> 29:48.169
I don't care what it tastes like.

29:53.339 --> 29:56.341
Wake up, doctor.

29:59.051 --> 30:01.929
Sub-commander.

30:02.138 --> 30:05.682
- Has it been 48 hours?
- No.

30:05.890 --> 30:07.766
Then why did you wake me?

30:07.975 --> 30:09.934
There's a medical emergency.

30:10.310 --> 30:13.479
Emergency? Then call the doctor.

30:13.854 --> 30:15.188
You're the doctor.

30:16.690 --> 30:19.191
Of course.

30:20.317 --> 30:21.443
Who's sick?

30:21.693 --> 30:23.820
- Ensign Mayweather.
- Who?

30:24.028 --> 30:28.865
- Ensign Mayweather, our helmsman.
- I know who he is.

30:29.574 --> 30:32.450
- Where is he?
- He's in Sickbay.

30:32.659 --> 30:34.244
We're not in Sickbay?

30:34.452 --> 30:36.453
We're in your quarters.

30:37.788 --> 30:39.747
Well, then...

30:41.541 --> 30:43.418
...to Sickbay.

30:45.252 --> 30:49.630
I could use some assistance, please.

30:58.469 --> 31:00.680
What seems to be
the trouble, captain?

31:02.472 --> 31:05.142
It's Travis, doctor.

31:05.350 --> 31:07.476
He's having some kind
of anaphylactic reaction.

31:08.978 --> 31:10.228
Incredible.

31:13.148 --> 31:14.982
- What?
- I've been standing up

31:15.190 --> 31:16.817
for almost five minutes.

31:17.066 --> 31:18.651
Doctor.

31:18.859 --> 31:21.861
Hand me that scanner, captain.

31:35.746 --> 31:38.290
Yes. Yes.

31:42.335 --> 31:46.088
It's definitely being caused by
an antigenic compound in his system.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.548
We'll need Regulan blood worms.

31:48.798 --> 31:51.132
- What?
- They're excellent at filtering toxins.

31:53.009 --> 31:56.637
- Which container are they in?
- No, fresh ones would be better.

31:56.845 --> 31:59.180
Set a course for Regulus,
maximum warp.

31:59.597 --> 32:03.600
Doctor, I think this was a mistake.
You should return to your quarters.

32:03.809 --> 32:05.518
I appreciate the offer,
but it would be best

32:05.726 --> 32:08.270
- to keep our relationship professional.
- Let's go, doctor.

32:08.521 --> 32:11.022
I am the chief medical officer
on this ship.

32:11.231 --> 32:14.817
And I am going to treat
Ensign Mayweather.

32:15.025 --> 32:17.235
Then I'm going back to bed.

32:20.946 --> 32:23.448
This was waiting for me
when I checked in.

32:23.657 --> 32:25.491
Compliments of the management.

32:25.699 --> 32:28.076
I don't know anything
about Risan vintages,

32:28.326 --> 32:30.328
but what do you say
we throw caution to the wind

32:30.537 --> 32:31.620
and give it a try?

32:32.037 --> 32:34.122
I'll be adventurous if you will.

32:36.832 --> 32:39.626
- How's your ankle?
- It's getting better.

32:39.834 --> 32:42.212
You'd think that guide
would've warned us.

32:42.420 --> 32:43.837
Oh, the water was very shallow.

32:44.046 --> 32:46.256
I should've watched
where I was stepping.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.924
I don't know.

32:48.132 --> 32:51.677
That thing was pretty
well camouflaged.

32:55.388 --> 32:57.348
To...

32:57.556 --> 33:00.100
...Risan sea turtles.

33:06.020 --> 33:08.689
It's a little sweet for my taste.

33:13.275 --> 33:15.277
Is something wrong?

33:16.111 --> 33:18.446
Camouflaged.

33:19.072 --> 33:21.031
We could only see them
when they moved.

33:21.406 --> 33:23.700
Was there more than one?

33:23.908 --> 33:26.661
I'm not talking about turtles.

33:30.163 --> 33:32.081
You said you knew who they were.

33:32.664 --> 33:34.833
Have you seen them?

33:35.416 --> 33:38.461
Did they hurt anyone
that you cared about?

33:39.961 --> 33:43.923
We've seen them a number of times,
but we've been lucky.

33:44.131 --> 33:46.174
No one was badly hurt.

33:47.842 --> 33:51.845
How do you fight something
you can't even see?

33:54.430 --> 33:58.600
I was told that they take their orders
from the future.

34:00.518 --> 34:03.562
- Is that right?
- All their genetic enhancements,

34:03.979 --> 34:07.774
they were taught to do that
by someone from the distant future.

34:09.274 --> 34:10.609
Who told you that?

34:11.485 --> 34:13.235
It's no secret.

34:13.444 --> 34:17.447
They've attacked
dozens of ships, settlements.

34:18.156 --> 34:20.699
But where do they come from?

34:20.908 --> 34:22.826
Where do they live?

34:26.120 --> 34:29.246
I wish I could tell you,
but I don't know.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.708
What are they planning to do next?

34:34.335 --> 34:37.170
Hopefully, neither of us will ever
run into them again.

34:37.420 --> 34:39.504
You know that isn't true.

34:39.713 --> 34:42.130
They keep enlisting
more of their people into the...

34:42.340 --> 34:44.507
What do they call it? The Cabal.

34:44.717 --> 34:47.010
You must know something
about them, Jonathan.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.971
I realize that they murdered
your family,

34:51.179 --> 34:53.889
and I'm very sorry for that.

34:54.098 --> 34:56.809
But I'm not sure
what you want me to tell you.

34:57.058 --> 34:59.352
Most of what I have learned
about them

34:59.561 --> 35:02.938
has come from
rumours and hearsay.

35:03.147 --> 35:06.316
But you have seen them
face to face.

35:06.524 --> 35:09.443
I want you to tell me what you know.

35:09.651 --> 35:12.820
Where are their Helixes?
Where do they live?

35:22.661 --> 35:25.580
If this wine is too sweet,

35:25.788 --> 35:30.041
I think there's another bottle here.
Might be different.

35:35.003 --> 35:37.255
You're the first person I've met
in over a year

35:37.505 --> 35:39.298
who's had any contact with them.

35:42.300 --> 35:48.263
All right. I don't know much,
but I'll tell you what I can.

35:51.599 --> 35:54.309
I could use some fresh air.

35:54.517 --> 35:56.185
Why don't we take a walk
on the beach.

36:00.938 --> 36:02.273
Thank you.

36:02.857 --> 36:05.984
It's kind of chilly. You might wanna
go get a sweater or something.

36:06.484 --> 36:08.193
I'll be right back.

36:22.454 --> 36:24.956
- Archer to Enterprise.
- This is T'Pol.

36:25.164 --> 36:28.041
I'm transmitting a bio-scan to you.
Run it through the computer.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.876
I think you'll find a match.

36:30.084 --> 36:32.336
You don't sound
very relaxed, captain.

36:32.545 --> 36:34.379
Quickly, please.

36:34.587 --> 36:36.589
Understood.

36:49.557 --> 36:52.393
- Ready?
- Not quite.

36:54.144 --> 36:56.645
Your surgeons did a nice job.

37:00.147 --> 37:04.067
All the Tandarans I met
had a very distinctive feature.

37:04.276 --> 37:05.569
Right here.

37:05.986 --> 37:07.861
Tandarans?

37:08.070 --> 37:09.738
I don't understand.

37:11.656 --> 37:14.033
I took a bio-scan.

37:14.825 --> 37:18.328
They may be able to change your face,
but not your DNA.

37:19.495 --> 37:22.747
- Did Colonel Grat send you?
- Who?

37:23.415 --> 37:26.083
I suppose it's possible
you don't know him.

37:26.291 --> 37:29.253
He ran the detention camp
I was sent to.

37:29.461 --> 37:31.963
It was filled with innocent Suliban.

37:32.213 --> 37:35.632
Grat asked me the same questions
you've been asking.

37:36.174 --> 37:38.342
Except he was a little more
aggressive.

37:38.551 --> 37:40.553
On the other hand,
he didn't try to win my sympathy

37:40.761 --> 37:42.929
with fictitious tragedies.

37:45.180 --> 37:49.308
You're wrong, Jonathan.
You're all wrong.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.394
I think I should leave.

37:51.894 --> 37:54.521
If it wasn't Grat, then who was it?

37:54.729 --> 37:56.188
Who sent you here?

37:57.064 --> 37:58.899
Who was it?

38:07.488 --> 38:09.406
I'm sorry.

38:12.033 --> 38:14.035
You've been very kind to me.

38:24.918 --> 38:26.752
I'm gonna check out now.

38:26.961 --> 38:29.712
I can't have you interfering.

38:39.345 --> 38:41.596
Whatever's in that bottle you broke
got all over me.

38:41.805 --> 38:43.181
It stinks to high heaven.

38:43.389 --> 38:47.935
It's not like I had a choice. We needed
something to cut through those ropes.

39:32.425 --> 39:34.218
Good morning.

39:34.426 --> 39:36.386
Morning.

39:37.053 --> 39:40.221
- Sleep well?
- Very.

39:43.433 --> 39:47.894
Any thoughts about
what you'd like to do today?

39:49.062 --> 39:51.147
Risa has a lot to offer.

39:52.564 --> 39:56.025
I could spend
the entire day right here.

39:56.525 --> 40:00.236
But I'm afraid the shuttle's coming
to pick me up in a few hours.

40:00.570 --> 40:02.905
Not a very long vacation.

40:04.072 --> 40:07.450
Two days and two nights.
That's all we had.

40:09.076 --> 40:12.120
I hope you don't think that I...

40:12.329 --> 40:14.538
Took advantage of me?

40:15.497 --> 40:17.749
Not for a minute.

40:24.630 --> 40:28.549
- There we go.
- You're certain?

40:29.174 --> 40:32.302
You can check it yourself
if you like, doctor.

40:32.509 --> 40:36.763
The analysis clearly shows
he was given benzethonium chloride.

40:37.013 --> 40:38.848
You're quite allergic to it.

40:39.056 --> 40:41.433
This should do the trick.

40:49.355 --> 40:52.482
Your bio-signs are stabilizing.

40:52.691 --> 40:54.359
It seems to be working.

40:55.234 --> 40:56.569
How do you feel?

40:59.237 --> 41:01.573
A lot better.

41:02.948 --> 41:05.034
Thanks, doc.

42:31.346 --> 42:33.597
What's that smell?

42:34.640 --> 42:35.974
I don't smell anything.

42:37.642 --> 42:40.769
I'm guessing you two
had an interesting couple of days.

42:42.187 --> 42:44.605
Fascinating culture, sir.

42:45.731 --> 42:49.317
What about you, Hoshi?
Do anything constructive?

42:49.526 --> 42:54.028
As a matter of fact,
I learned several new conjugations.

42:56.823 --> 43:00.617
You look rested, sir.
Did you get a good night's sleep?

43:00.826 --> 43:02.368
Went out like a light.

43:03.369 --> 43:06.496
Next time we take shore leave, instead
of just sitting around reading books,

43:06.746 --> 43:10.541
you should try to get out,
look for a little excitement.

43:10.749 --> 43:12.708
Meet new people.
