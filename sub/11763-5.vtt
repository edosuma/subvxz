WEBVTT

00:01.332 --> 00:03.104
(clanks)
(all, high-pitched voices)
PENNY CAN!

00:03.104 --> 00:04.004
WHOO!

00:04.004 --> 00:06.137
YOU KNOW WHY I KEEP
THESE NOTEPADS AROUND?

00:06.137 --> 00:08.039
BECAUSE I LIKE
TO MAKE LISTS.

00:08.039 --> 00:10.211
"NAMES FOR TRAVIS
IF HE WAS A GIRL."

00:10.211 --> 00:12.213
OH. NUMBER ONE--
"JULES JR." (chuckles)

00:12.213 --> 00:14.085
BUT HE'D GO BY "J.J."

00:14.085 --> 00:16.647
AW.
LOVE THAT.

00:16.647 --> 00:19.550
"WHO'S THE HOTTEST IN OUR GANG?"
THE THREE OF US TIED FOR FIRST.

00:19.550 --> 00:22.253
WHY IS YOUR NAME
ON THE TOP?
DON'T SNOOP.

00:22.253 --> 00:24.795
I'M STARTING A NEW LIST--
"MOST BORING GAME."

00:24.795 --> 00:27.258
NUMBER ONE
WITH A BULLET...
(penny clanks)

00:27.258 --> 00:29.360
(women, high-pitched voices)
PENNY CAN!

00:29.360 --> 00:32.333
I HAVE AN IDEA ON HOW TO MAKE
THIS DUMB GAME BETTER--

00:32.333 --> 00:34.135
"TRUTH OR PENNY CAN."

00:34.135 --> 00:37.108
OOH.
IF YOU MISS, YOU HAVE TO ANSWER
A PERSONAL QUESTION. WHO'S IN?

00:37.108 --> 00:39.140
OH!
YEAH!

00:39.140 --> 00:41.512
GET READY TO BE EMBARRASSED,
BOYS.

00:41.512 --> 00:43.344
(clank)
WHOO!

00:43.344 --> 00:45.216
(clank)

00:45.216 --> 00:48.048
(clank)

00:48.048 --> 00:50.050
(clank)
DANG IT!

00:50.050 --> 00:51.682
HA HA!
(laughs) ALL RIGHT.

00:51.682 --> 00:55.156
I GOT A QUESTION. WHAT IS
THAT WORD YOU CAN'T PRONOUNCE?

00:55.156 --> 00:58.229
THERE ARE NO WORDS,
'CAUSE I'M GREAT AT WORDS.
HOW DO YOU SAY R-U-I-N?

00:58.229 --> 01:00.191
ROYN.
(snickers)

01:00.191 --> 01:02.263
WHAT? SHUT UP.
I HATE THIS GAME.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.395
WHY? WOULD YOU SAY
WE ROYNED IT?
(laughter)

01:04.395 --> 01:07.098
(babbles)
OKAY. MY TURN.

01:07.098 --> 01:09.840
OHH!
OH. OKAY, I GOT ONE.
WHAT ARE THOSE SPARKLY THINGS?

01:09.840 --> 01:12.543
OH, IT'S JUST THE TOPS
OF BUTTERFLY WINGS.

01:12.543 --> 01:15.546
I GOT VAJAZZLED. DO YOU GUYS
WANT TO KNOW WHAT VAJAZZLING IS?

01:15.546 --> 01:18.509
YES, I... DON'T.

01:18.509 --> 01:20.711
OKAY, MY TURN.

01:20.711 --> 01:22.082
(clank)
OH!

01:22.082 --> 01:25.186
(both imitate buzzer)
OH, OH, OH! I GOT THIS ONE.

01:25.186 --> 01:28.759
BOBBY, DOES TAKING ALIMONY FROM
JULES FEEL MORE LIKE STEALING

01:28.759 --> 01:31.762
OR FEEL MORE LIKE PUTTING
YOUR PRIDE IN A BURLAP SACK

01:31.762 --> 01:34.165
AND THROWING IT
OFF A BRIDGE?

01:36.727 --> 01:39.470
TRUTH OR PENNY CAN
JUST GOT REAL, Y'ALL.

01:43.174 --> 01:44.435
ELLIE.
(door opens)

01:44.435 --> 01:47.678
DON'T HATE THE PLAYA,
HATE THE GAME, YO.
(door closes)

01:47.678 --> 01:49.180
BREAKUPS JUST SUCK.

01:49.180 --> 01:52.513
NO. WE HAD A GOOD RUN.

01:52.513 --> 01:55.186
DAD, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE HERE.

01:55.186 --> 01:58.189
LET ME ENJOY THE MOMENT.

01:58.189 --> 02:01.252
I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER
IF I LEFT MY HAIR DRYER HERE.

02:01.252 --> 02:04.155
OHH. HUH, MUST BE
MY PREGNANCY BRAIN.

02:04.155 --> 02:06.657
NO.
IT'S A JOKE, DAD. BE NICE.

02:06.657 --> 02:10.261
(sighs) YOU KNOW, LAURIE,
WE DIDN'T ALWAYS GET ALONG,

02:10.261 --> 02:12.463
AND I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT...

02:12.463 --> 02:14.605
(lowered voice)
IT'S OVER, MISSY.

02:14.605 --> 02:17.808
HERE'S THE CURB, AND HERE'S WHAT
HE'S DOING TO YA. (grunts) AAH!

02:17.808 --> 02:20.811
(normal voice) I WISH YOU
NOTHING BUT THE VERY BEST.

02:20.811 --> 02:22.613
VERY IMPRESSIVE, SIR.

02:22.613 --> 02:24.675
(babbles)

02:24.675 --> 02:26.877
(Southern accent)
I LIKE THE HOUSE.

02:26.877 --> 02:29.880
BUT THERE ANY WAY WE CAN MAKE
THE BATHROOM LESS CHINESE?

02:29.880 --> 02:34.585
OH. I THINK THE SHOJI SCREENS
CREATE A NICE SPATIAL FLOW.

02:34.585 --> 02:37.428
SURE. WE CAN MAKE IT
LESS CHINESE.

02:37.428 --> 02:40.331
HEY. (sighs) LAURIE TOLD ME
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

02:40.331 --> 02:44.865
OOH. WHAT, YOU ADDING SOMEBODY
TO YOUR "WORST CLIENT" LIST?
I CAN'T RELATE TO THIS DUDE.

02:44.865 --> 02:48.499
I MEAN, HE'S EVEN TOO REDNECK
FOR ME, AND I'VE GOT

02:48.499 --> 02:51.272
A COUSIN NAMED GRITS.
SOMETHIN' SCARED UP A BUNCH
OF BAITFISH OUT THERE.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.644
IT WAS PROBABLY
A BIG OL' SNOOK. (chuckles)

02:53.644 --> 02:55.946
YOU EVER HOOK
INTO A MONSTER SNOOK?

02:55.946 --> 02:58.779
YOU'RE ALL LIKE, "WHOO!"
AND YOU'RE ALL, "WHOO!"

02:58.779 --> 03:00.681
WHOO!
WHOO!

03:00.681 --> 03:03.914
WHOO! HOW COULD I DO
"WHOO" WRONG?

03:03.914 --> 03:06.217
I'LL BE IN TOUCH,
JULIE.

03:06.217 --> 03:09.490
LET ME GO CLOSE THAT GUY. HE'S
MY PEOPLE. PUT ME IN, COACH.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.863
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.
WHAT'S UP?
I HAD ANDY GO OVER MY FINANCES.
I'M DOING PRETTY GOOD, J-BIRD.

03:12.863 --> 03:16.327
PICKED UP A FEW MORE GOLF
LESSONS, YOU KNOW, AND IF I CUT

03:16.327 --> 03:19.570
SOME CORNERS AND MAYBE SELL
SOME OF TRAVIS'S SPERM--

03:19.570 --> 03:21.532
MNH.
DOG TRAVIS.

03:21.532 --> 03:24.505
STILL WEIRD.
THE POINT IS, I WANT
TO STOP TAKING ALIMONY.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.206
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:26.206 --> 03:28.409
NO MORE ALIMONY!

03:28.409 --> 03:30.411
(pants)
NO MORE ALIMONY. MWAH.

03:33.444 --> 03:34.945
SHE TOOK MY FRIES.

03:34.945 --> 03:36.847
NO MORE ALIMONY!

03:36.847 --> 03:38.549
AND HAVE A FRY!

03:38.549 --> 03:39.990
ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE.

03:39.990 --> 03:43.524
(panting) NO MORE ALIMONY.
NO MORE ALIMONY.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.526
AND YOU'RE HOME
FROM COLLEGE.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.398
MMM!

03:47.398 --> 03:48.959
I BROUGHT LAUNDRY.

03:48.959 --> 03:50.961
AND YOU STILL NEED ME.

03:50.961 --> 03:52.963
(whispers)
I LOVE THIS DAY.

03:52.963 --> 03:55.966
I'M GOING OUT TROLLING FOR
DUDES TONIGHT, BUT--DILEMMA.

03:55.966 --> 03:58.969
I ONLY HAVE HALF A CAN
OF SPRAY TAN LEFT.

03:58.969 --> 04:01.672
DO I GO NORTH...
OR SOUTH SIDE?

04:01.672 --> 04:04.275
I'D GO WITH ZEBRA STRIPES.
SLOW DOWN.

04:04.275 --> 04:06.917
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE HAD YOUR HEART BROKEN.
I'M FINE.

04:06.917 --> 04:09.750
YOU TOLD ME YOU DREAMED
ABOUT HAVING KIDS WITH SMITH.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.683
THERE'S NO RUSH FOR ME
TO HAVE KIDS.

04:12.683 --> 04:14.685
MY FAMILY IS SUPER FERTILE.

04:14.685 --> 04:16.927
MY AUNT GOT PREGNANT TRYING
ON BIKINIS. TRUE STORY.

04:16.927 --> 04:19.430
IT'S NOT.
WELL,
MY UNCLE BELIEVED HER.

04:19.430 --> 04:22.633
ULTIMATELY, THAT CHILD
SAVED THEIR MARRIAGE, SO...

04:22.633 --> 04:24.835
CHECK IT.
I GOT A MARGARITA MACHINE

04:24.835 --> 04:26.837
FOR BOBBY'S NO-ALIMONY PARTY
TOMORROW.

04:26.837 --> 04:29.640
OH! MARGIES TAKE ME BACK
TO A VACATION I TOOK

04:29.640 --> 04:33.444
ON THE ISLAND OF MEXICO.
YOU MEAN AN ISLAND
OFF THE COAST OF MEXICO.

04:33.444 --> 04:35.946
NO. THAT WHOLE SUCKER'S
AN ISLAND.
YEAH.

04:35.946 --> 04:37.948
BUT... WE DROVE THERE.

04:37.948 --> 04:39.750
(chuckles) TRAVIS.

04:39.750 --> 04:42.313
MEXICO HAS BEACHES.

04:42.313 --> 04:44.985
SO EVEN THOUGH WE LIVE
IN FLORIDA,

04:44.985 --> 04:47.888
WHICH IS A STATE COVERED
WITH BEACHES,

04:47.888 --> 04:49.390
YOU'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT

04:49.390 --> 04:52.963
THAT BECAUSE MEXICO HAS BEACHES,
IT'S AN ISLAND?

04:52.963 --> 04:55.326
MM-HMM.
ABSOLUTELY.

04:55.326 --> 04:58.969
(Jules) OF COURSE.
SEE, TRAV. THIS IS
WHY I'M GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

04:58.969 --> 05:01.071
BECAUSE WITHOUT YOU,
I, TOO, AM AN ISLAND,

05:01.071 --> 05:03.934
SURROUNDED BY AN OCEAN
OF DUMMIES ON ALL SIDES,

05:03.934 --> 05:06.377
WHICH IS WHAT AN ISLAND IS...
YA DUMMIES.

05:06.377 --> 05:09.009
NO NEED TO CALL NAMES.
SEEMS A LITTLE HARSH.
(mouth full) YEAH. CHILL.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.982
YOU SPEND ALL YOUR FREE TIME
THROWING PENNIES IN A CAN.

05:11.982 --> 05:15.015
I BET NONE OF YOU HAVE READ
A BOOK IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS.
I JUST FINISHED A BOOK.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.588
THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL
TO THE MARGARITA MACHINE

05:17.588 --> 05:20.591
DOESN'T REALLY COUNT
AS A BOOK.
WHY NOT? IT WAS A PAGE-TURNER.
YOU KNOW, FOR A WHILE THERE,

05:20.591 --> 05:23.554
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE TO PUT THE ICE.
GOOD GOD.

05:23.554 --> 05:25.396
(speaks inaudibly)

05:25.396 --> 05:28.759
HE'S ALREADY WITH SOMEONE?
AW, POOR LAURIE.

05:28.759 --> 05:31.762
"POOR LAURIE"? I HAVEN'T BEEN
CALLED THAT SINCE GRADE SCHOOL.

05:31.762 --> 05:34.765
I USED TO HAVE TO TRADE KISSES
FOR MILK MONEY. (sighs)

05:34.765 --> 05:36.937
OH, HELL, NO!

05:36.937 --> 05:39.440
SMITH!
YOU ARE A DEAD MAN!

05:39.440 --> 05:41.542
BE COOL. IT'S MY BAR.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.614
THANK YOU.

05:43.614 --> 05:45.776
AAH.
(both) OHH!

05:45.776 --> 05:48.018
(grunts)
(mouths word)

05:48.018 --> 05:51.021
YOU GUYS, HE'S NOT MOVING.
OKAY.
MY CAR HAS A HUGE TRUNK.

05:51.021 --> 05:52.723
WHAT?!
REALLY?

05:52.723 --> 05:55.055
(laughs)
RIGHT TO DISPOSING OF THE BODY?

05:55.055 --> 05:57.057
GOTCHA, BITCHES!
WHAT?!

05:57.057 --> 06:00.931
FAKE GLASS! I TOLD YOU GUYS
I WAS FINE.

06:00.931 --> 06:03.063
YOU KNOW, THE KICK
WAS A SURPRISE, THOUGH.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.766
I WAS IN THE MOMENT.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.768
SOME OF US OVERDID IT

06:07.768 --> 06:10.100
AT THE PRE-NO-MORE-ALIMONY-PARTY
PARTY,

06:10.100 --> 06:12.603
SO I'VE RIMMED THESE MARGARITAS
WITH CRUSHED-UP ASPIRIN.

06:12.603 --> 06:15.946
THEY SHOULD MARKET THIS
TO DRUNKS... OR US.

06:15.946 --> 06:17.808
ANYWAY, TO BOBBY!

06:17.808 --> 06:19.980
YEAH! TO ME!
WHOO, WHOO, WHOO!
YEAH!

06:19.980 --> 06:23.684
LET'S GET THIS PARTY BUMPIN'.
(chuckles) I HATE MYSELF.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.787
YO, DAD, CHECK IT OUT!

06:26.787 --> 06:30.621
WHOA! (chuckles) NICE,
BUDDY. I'M COMIN' IN.

06:32.763 --> 06:34.765
OH, GOOD.
I AM WEARIN' TRUNKS.

06:34.765 --> 06:38.469
(clink)
HEY, ANDY. THANKS FOR TAKING
CARE OF BOBBY'S MONEY STUFF.

06:38.469 --> 06:41.101
HAD TO MAKE
SOME REAL SACRIFICES.
LAUR, I WANT YOU TO THROW IT,

06:41.101 --> 06:43.804
AND I'M GONNA CATCH IT
IN MY MOUTH, DOG-STYLE.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.036
GET READY TO FETCH.
WHO'S A GOOD BOY?

06:46.036 --> 06:49.409
(chuckles)
WHAT KIND OF SACRIFICES?
HE DROPPED
HIS HEALTH INSURANCE.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.913
HIS HEALTH INSURANCE?
(diving board rattles)

06:52.913 --> 06:55.616
(slow-motion voice) OHH!

06:55.616 --> 06:57.117
(thud)
(Bobby grunts)

06:57.117 --> 06:59.590
(mouth full) I GOT IT.

06:59.590 --> 07:00.991
OHH. (groans)

07:00.991 --> 07:02.993
(high-pitched voice) BOBBY!
(glass shatters)

07:02.993 --> 07:04.995
(splash)

07:04.995 --> 07:07.998
в™Єв™Єв™Є

07:15.866 --> 07:17.708
(whack)
THERE YOU GO, ROGE.

07:17.708 --> 07:21.512
BOBBY. OKAY. YOU KNOW HOW
I LOVE DOING DISGUSTING STUFF.

07:21.512 --> 07:23.514
I WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME

07:23.514 --> 07:25.516
JAM YOUR SHOULDER BACK IN.

07:25.516 --> 07:27.518
I MEAN,
BETWEEN THE POPPING NOISE

07:27.518 --> 07:30.721
AND ANDY THROWING UP...
OHH. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

07:30.721 --> 07:32.723
SECONDLY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TEACHING GOLF LESSONS?

07:32.723 --> 07:34.725
YOU'RE HURT. YOU'VE GOTTA
GO SEE A DOCTOR.

07:34.725 --> 07:37.057
IF IT'S ABOUT THE MONEY,
I WILL PAY.

07:37.057 --> 07:40.160
NO, I'M DONE TAKING MONEY
FROM YOU. IT'S NOT RIGHT.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.162
BESIDES, I'M FINE.
(whack)

07:42.162 --> 07:45.165
ROGER, YOU'RE OPENING UP
YOUR HIPS. HERE. TRY THIS.

07:45.165 --> 07:48.769
OOH. OHH!
(mouths word)

07:48.769 --> 07:50.571
WHAT'S WITH THE SCREAM?

07:50.571 --> 07:52.843
HELPS YOU FOCUS.

07:52.843 --> 07:54.975
OKAY.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.948
I AM SLAMMED AT WORK.
I COULD REALLY USE YOUR HELP,

07:57.948 --> 08:01.712
AND YOU CAN GET
ON OUR HEALTH INSURANCE.
THIS ISN'T CHARITY?

08:01.712 --> 08:03.714
YOU'D BE DOING ME A FAVOR.

08:03.714 --> 08:06.056
ALL RIGHT. STARTING TOMORROW,
CONSIDER ME YOUR BITCH.

08:06.056 --> 08:08.058
SWEETIE, I ALREADY DO.
(whack)

08:08.058 --> 08:10.490
(growls) AHH!

08:10.490 --> 08:13.624
(chuckles) YOU'RE RIGHT.
LOOK AT THAT.

08:13.624 --> 08:15.626
YEAH, I THINK
WE'RE BOTH GONNA HAVE

08:15.626 --> 08:18.629
THE "YOU'RE HOOKING UP
WITH MY MOM" HAMBURGER.
(menu thuds)

08:18.629 --> 08:20.631
WHAT'S ON THAT?
WHO CARES? IT'S FREE.

08:20.631 --> 08:21.932
(singsongy) HEY!

08:21.932 --> 08:24.635
YES, OF COURSE WE CAN GRAB
A BEER SOMETIME.

08:24.635 --> 08:25.976
WE'RE FRIENDS.

08:25.976 --> 08:28.909
ALL RIGHT. LATER, SMITH.
(beep)

08:28.909 --> 08:31.642
GIANT MISTAKE.
I CAN BE FRIENDS
WITH MY EX.

08:31.642 --> 08:33.914
(chuckles) RIGHT.
"HEY, LET'S BE FRIENDS."

08:33.914 --> 08:37.287
"OKAY. WELL, YOU WANNA
COME OVER AND WATCH A MOVIE?"

08:37.287 --> 08:39.920
"SURE." "IS THAT THE BRA
THAT I COULD NEVER UNFASTEN?

08:39.920 --> 08:43.093
LET ME TRY JUST ONCE."
"NO." "YES." "NO."

08:43.093 --> 08:45.556
"OKAY, WELL..." AND BOOM.
HE'S HITTIN' THAT AGAIN.

08:45.556 --> 08:47.558
I THINK WHAT
THE PREPPIE MURDERER

08:47.558 --> 08:51.031
IS TRYING TO SAY IS
THAT YOU'RE VULNERABLE--
AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,

08:51.031 --> 08:54.805
YOU'LL END UP FEELING DUMPED
ALL OVER AGAIN.
AND THAT'S JUST
A SPECIAL KIND OF SAD.

08:54.805 --> 08:56.807
SAD IS
WHEN YOUR FOSTER BROTHER

08:56.807 --> 08:58.809
LOSES AN EYE IN
A BACKYARD WRESTLING MATCH.

08:58.809 --> 09:00.871
TRUE STORY. (imitates thud)
SPRINKLER HEAD.

09:00.871 --> 09:03.944
IS THAT THE ONE
THEY CALL "CYCLOPS"?
WEIRDLY,
A DIFFERENT BROTHER.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.947
LOOK, THE POINT IS, I'M NOT LIKE
YOU GUYS, OKAY? (chuckles)

09:06.947 --> 09:09.179
IN MY RELATIONSHIPS,
I'M THE DUDE.

09:09.179 --> 09:11.982
(smacks table)
ERGO, YOU GUYS ARE CHICKS.

09:11.982 --> 09:13.984
PFFT. NO.
I'M VERY MACHO.

09:13.984 --> 09:16.987
IS IT MACHO
TO CALL YOURSELF MACHO?
ANDY, YOU ARE
A RHINESTONE COLLAR AWAY

09:16.987 --> 09:19.059
FROM ACTUALLY BEING
ELLIE'S LAPDOG.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.032
(laughs) OH! BURNED!
AND, TRAVIS,
YOU'RE LITERALLY WEARING

09:22.032 --> 09:25.035
KYLIE'S
VARSITY FIELD HOCKEY JERSEY.

09:25.035 --> 09:26.336
I'M PROUD OF HER.

09:26.336 --> 09:28.038
OH, TRAV.

09:28.038 --> 09:30.901
BOBBY'S WORKING FOR YOU?

09:30.901 --> 09:32.903
WHAT DID THE WANT AD SAY?

09:32.903 --> 09:34.905
"SEEKING NASTY,
FLIP-FLOP-WEARING REDNECK

09:34.905 --> 09:37.908
WHO SPEAKS GIBBERISH"?
I'LL JUST GIVE HIM
A BUNCH OF FAKE BUSYWORK

09:37.908 --> 09:40.110
UNTIL HE GOES
TO SEE A DOCTOR.

09:40.110 --> 09:42.112
YOU DIVORCED BOBBY
BECAUSE HE CHEATED ON YOU.

09:42.112 --> 09:44.685
WHY DO YOU KEEP
TAKING CARE OF HIM?

09:44.685 --> 09:48.088
MY NAME IS JULES COBB.
HERE'S MY CARD.
I DON'T...

09:48.088 --> 09:51.061
THAT'S MY A.T.M. CARD.
I NEED IT.
ANYBODY WANT TO GO
TO THE MOVIES LATER?

09:51.061 --> 09:52.823
THEY'RE SHOWING A DOCUMENTARY

09:52.823 --> 09:54.825
ON THE HISTORY OF LOCOMOTION
AND KINETIC ENERGY.

09:54.825 --> 09:56.827
IT'S THE FIRST
OF A SERIES, SO...

09:56.827 --> 09:59.129
OH. I'M SORRY.
I JUST NODDED OFF. WHAT?

09:59.129 --> 10:01.932
I'LL GO, BUT I HAVE TO
WARN YOU, I'VE BEEN HANGING OUT

10:01.932 --> 10:03.934
WITH THE JELLY BEAN GANG
FOR SO LONG

10:03.934 --> 10:05.936
THAT IF I'M EXPOSED
TO ANYTHING INTELLECTUAL,

10:05.936 --> 10:07.938
MY BRAIN MIGHT EXPLODE
ALL OVER YOUR FACE.

10:07.938 --> 10:11.882
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO COME?
YOU COULD LEARN SOMETHING.
(snoring)

10:11.882 --> 10:15.145
LOOK.
I'M A DEAD GUY IN A COFFIN.

10:15.145 --> 10:18.348
HERE'S THE DEAL.
JULES IS A CHILL BOSS.

10:18.348 --> 10:22.022
JUST TELL HER SHE LOOKS PRETTY
WHEN SHE SHOWS UP,

10:22.022 --> 10:24.825
AND IF YOU DO NEED A BREAK, LIKE
TO WATCH A MOVIE ON YOUR PHONE,

10:24.825 --> 10:26.827
TELL HER YOU HAVE
"AN URGENT PERSONAL MATTER."
(door opens)

10:26.827 --> 10:29.399
HI.
OH, MY GOD.
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY.

10:29.399 --> 10:32.002
SO PRETTY!
OH, GOOD.
YOU'VE BEEN BRIEFED.

10:32.002 --> 10:36.066
LAURIE, WILL YOU PULL THE COMP
SALES ON THE EDELMAN HOUSE?
GOT IT.

10:36.066 --> 10:38.068
SO... WHAT DO I DO?

10:38.068 --> 10:41.041
OH. LET'S START
BY SHARPENING THESE PENCILS.
SERIOUSLY?

10:41.041 --> 10:44.144
BOBBY, IF I'M ON A CALL
WITH A CLIENT AND I HAVE TO SAY,

10:44.144 --> 10:47.748
"UH, COULD YOU HOLD ON, PLEASE?
I'VE GOTTA SHARPEN MY PENCIL.
(cell phone chimes)

10:47.748 --> 10:50.681
OH. YOU CAN'T HOLD?"
BOOM! BLOWN SALE.

10:50.681 --> 10:53.854
I HAVE TO GO ATTEND
TO AN URGENT PERSONAL MATTER.

10:53.854 --> 10:57.057
OKAY. MOVIE.
I CAN HANDLE
HER SALES COMP THINGIE

10:57.057 --> 11:00.290
JUST AS SOON AS I GET THROUGH
WITH THESE PENCILS.

11:00.290 --> 11:03.033
UM, SEE, BOBBY,
YOU'RE AN IDEA GUY,

11:03.033 --> 11:05.736
SO WHY DON'T YOU SPEND
SOME TIME

11:05.736 --> 11:09.369
BRAINSTORMING ON NEW IDEAS
OF HOW TO DRUM UP BUSINESS?

11:09.369 --> 11:12.202
MAYBE A SANDWICH CARD,
BUT FOR HOMES.

11:12.202 --> 11:15.005
WITH EVERY THIRD HOUSE YOU BUY,
YOU GET A BOAT FOR FREE.

11:15.005 --> 11:17.007
YEAH, LIKE THAT.
EXCEPT FOR NOT THAT.

11:17.007 --> 11:20.280
NOW I HAVE TO GO SHOW A HOUSE.
WHERE DO YOU THINK LAURIE IS?

11:20.280 --> 11:21.982
WOW.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.284
THAT WAS LIKE RIDING
A MECHANICAL BULL.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.818
(sighs) WE SHOULD
BREAK UP MORE OFTEN.

11:27.818 --> 11:29.119
(laughs)

11:29.119 --> 11:32.092
(Travis) SO, UH, WHY ARE WE
PUTTING MOM'S FACE ON BEER?

11:32.092 --> 11:33.794
IT'S A PROMOTIONAL IDEA.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.096
YOU'VE HOOKED ME.
HOW DOES IT WORK?

11:36.096 --> 11:38.969
EASY.

11:38.969 --> 11:42.102
HEY, STRANGER. DO YOU WANNA
COME IN AND LOOK AT SOME HOUSES?

11:42.102 --> 11:44.104
WHAT'S A 6-LETTER WORD

11:44.104 --> 11:46.977
FOR "LADY WHO PLAYED
HER EX-HUSBAND LIKE A FIDDLE"?

11:46.977 --> 11:48.909
(chuckles) JULES!

11:48.909 --> 11:50.280
"JULES" IS FIVE LETTERS.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.382
I WAS COUNTING
THE EXCLAMATION POINT.

11:52.382 --> 11:54.945
YOU KNOW,
I'M GETTING A LITTLE TIRED

11:54.945 --> 11:57.217
OF YOUR SMARTY-PANTS ATTITUDE.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.220
OH, THE WORD IS "CONDESCENDING,"
SHE SAID CONDESCENDINGLY.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.924
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S IT. YOU THINK
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN US?

12:03.924 --> 12:05.956
POP QUIZ.
WHO IS PAUL RUDOLPH?

12:05.956 --> 12:10.000
WELL, THAT'S EASY.
WHO CARES?
HE'S ONLY THE MOST FAMOUS
ARCHITECT IN FLORIDA. (chuckles)

12:10.000 --> 12:13.733
PFFT.
THAT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING
A SMART PERSON WOULD KNOW.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.035
ME NEXT.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.307
WE ARE CURRENTLY AT WAR
WITH AFGHANISTAN.

12:17.307 --> 12:19.009
POINT TO IT.

12:19.009 --> 12:21.171
IT'S IN THAT... AREA.

12:21.171 --> 12:23.313
THAT'S... PRETTY GENERAL.

12:23.313 --> 12:25.745
OKAY, ANDY.
KNOCK HER OUT.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.979
WHAT... ARE...
(high-pitched voice) BONDS?

12:28.979 --> 12:31.982
THEY'RE LIKE MONEY,
BUT THEY'RE NOT.
(Jules chuckles)

12:31.982 --> 12:34.184
(imitates buzzer)
AND FOR THE CHERRY ON TOP,

12:34.184 --> 12:37.027
LET'S JUST TAKE A PEEK
AT YOUR LAPTOP.
THAT'S PRIVATE. THAT--

12:37.027 --> 12:39.229
GIVE IT TO ME, GIRL.
OW.

12:39.229 --> 12:43.463
OKAY.
HMM. WHOA. SOMEONE HAS BEEN
BLOGGING ABOUT "PROJECT RUNWAY"?

12:43.463 --> 12:46.466
HEIDI KLUM'S FACE IS
TOO ROUND TO HAVE A BOWL CUT.

12:46.466 --> 12:50.470
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW.
(all chanting)
ONE OF US. ONE OF US.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.973
(chuckles) STOP IT. STOP IT.
ONE OF US. ONE OF US.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.475
YOU KNOW WHY I DIG
HOOKING UP WITH YOU?

12:55.475 --> 12:57.808
BECAUSE YOU'RE DEFINITELY
MANLY ENOUGH FOR ME,

12:57.808 --> 12:59.810
BUT YOU'RE ALSO SO SLIGHT
THAT I CAN, LIKE,

12:59.810 --> 13:03.083
SPIN YA LIKE A MINI PIZZA.
THANKS, I GUESS.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.956
DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE
WE SHOULD KEEP DOING THIS?

13:05.956 --> 13:07.958
YEAH. I-I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD, UM, YOU KNOW,

13:07.958 --> 13:12.062
START--START ACTING
LIKE A COUPLE AGAIN.
YEAH. (laughs)

13:12.062 --> 13:15.265
AND THERE IT IS.
HERE COME THE WATERWORKS.

13:15.265 --> 13:17.067
LEAVE ME ALONE. IT'S SAD.

13:17.067 --> 13:20.570
I WAS TALKING ABOUT HER.
SHE'S GONNA BE A WRECK.

13:20.570 --> 13:22.933
IT'S YOUR LOSS, SMITTY,
BECAUSE YOUR MEMBERSHIP

13:22.933 --> 13:24.975
TO THIS... ENTIRE AREA

13:24.975 --> 13:27.107
IS NOW...
(singsongy) REVOKED.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.408
(normal voice)
HEY, GRAYSON.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.041
CAN WE GET TWO MORE BEERS
OVER HERE, PLEASE?

13:31.041 --> 13:32.983
I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT.

13:34.985 --> 13:38.118
(indistinct conversations)
BOBBY, WHAT THE HELL?

13:38.118 --> 13:40.220
I DRUMMED UP NEW BUSINESS.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.022
IT'S THE LADY
FROM THE CAN!

13:42.022 --> 13:45.125
(cheering)

13:45.125 --> 13:46.826
HEY. (chuckles)

13:48.128 --> 13:50.060
LOOK AT THIS MESS.

13:50.060 --> 13:52.062
AND WHAT ARE MY WORK SLIPPERS
DOING OVER HERE?

13:52.062 --> 13:54.965
UGH.
AND THEY'RE WARM AND MOIST.

13:54.965 --> 13:57.037
BOBBY,
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

13:57.037 --> 14:00.110
THEY WERE
POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS.
MOST OF THEM ARE HOMELESS.

14:00.110 --> 14:02.072
EXACTLY. THEY NEED HOMES!

14:02.072 --> 14:04.074
I DON'T SELL
CARDBOARD BOXES.

14:04.074 --> 14:07.147
(groans)
GOD, WHY COULDN'T YOU HAVE
JUST BEEN HAPPY DOING BUSYWORK?

14:07.147 --> 14:10.150
I GET IT. YOU JUST WANTED ME
TO SIT THERE AND DO NOTHING.

14:10.150 --> 14:13.954
LOOK, JULES, I TOLD YA,
I DON'T WANT YOUR CHARITY.

14:13.954 --> 14:17.357
COME ON. IF I DON'T TAKE CARE
OF YOU, WHO'S GOING TO? YOU?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.059
GIVE ME A BREAK.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.631
THANKS FOR LOOKIN' OUT,
J-BIRD.

14:21.631 --> 14:24.134
YOU'RE A SWEETHEART.

14:24.134 --> 14:25.896
OH, GOD.

14:25.896 --> 14:27.197
BOBBY.

14:31.301 --> 14:33.603
"JULES COBB. DRINK ME IN."

14:33.603 --> 14:35.445
DAMN. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.883
HEY, J.J.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.555
THAT'S YOUR GIRL NAME.

14:45.555 --> 14:49.019
OF COURSE. YOU KNOW, DAD'S ARM
IS STILL PRETTY MESSED UP.
IS HE STILL MAD?

14:49.019 --> 14:51.161
(mouth full) SHE TREATS ME
LIKE I'M SOME KIND OF BABY.

14:51.161 --> 14:53.123
I'M NOT A BABY.
(normal voice) TRAV-TRAVIS!

14:53.123 --> 14:56.126
MAN! NOT SO HARD.
YOU'RE TEARING UP MY GUMS.
I MISS COLLEGE. SPIT.

14:56.126 --> 14:57.968
OHH.

14:57.968 --> 15:00.030
MOM, YOU DECIMATED HIM.

15:00.030 --> 15:02.172
A GUY WITH FOUR TEETH
WAS DRINKING A BEER

15:02.172 --> 15:03.673
WITH MY FACE ON IT.

15:03.673 --> 15:06.336
TRAVIS,
HE SAID I WENT DOWN SMOOTH.

15:06.336 --> 15:08.578
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

15:08.578 --> 15:11.511
I DO NOT LIKE IT
WHEN YOU ACT LIKE MY PARENT.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.514
NOW, JULES,
I THINK I RAISED YOU--
STOP IT.

15:14.514 --> 15:17.087
I WILL APOLOGIZE TO DAD.
IF HE DOESN'T WANT OUR HELP,

15:17.087 --> 15:20.090
THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE TO LIVE
WITH IT.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

15:20.090 --> 15:23.093
HE TEXTS ME EVERY TIME
HE HAS A 2-ARMED TASK,

15:23.093 --> 15:25.925
WHICH FOR SOME REASON
INCLUDES EATING A SANDWICH.
HE DOES LIKE BIG SANDWICHES.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.928
HE'S ALSO GOT ANDY
HOOKING HIM UP WITH A DOCTOR.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.930
IT'S NOT THAT
HE DOESN'T WANT HELP.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.932
HE JUST DOESN'T WANT HELP
FROM YOU.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.135
J.J., THAT IS NOT COOL.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.337
(clanks)

15:37.337 --> 15:40.040
DID YOU JUST THROW THAT
FROM THERE?

15:40.040 --> 15:41.541
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.543
AND THE WORST PART IS,

15:43.543 --> 15:45.045
I LOVE IT.

15:45.045 --> 15:48.078
(clank)
(high-pitched voice)
PENNY CAN.

15:48.078 --> 15:51.081
WHAT WAS I GONNA DO, HIT SMITH?
UGH. HE'S TOO SKINNY.

15:51.081 --> 15:53.353
IT'D BE LIKE PUNCHING
SARAH JESSICA PARKER.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.255
(chuckles)
I WISH YOU... WOULD.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.988
BESIDES,
I ENJOYED THE DUMP-AND-BUMP

15:57.988 --> 16:00.330
AS MUCH AS HE DID.
YOU ACTUALLY PULLED OFF
BEING FRIENDS WITH YOUR EX

16:00.330 --> 16:02.592
WITHOUT GETTING HURT.
IT'S LIKE ALL THE THINGS

16:02.592 --> 16:05.465
I THOUGHT WERE IMPOSSIBLE
ARE SUDDENLY POSSIBLE.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.298
MAYBE I CAN WEAR BOW TIES.
NO.

16:08.298 --> 16:11.201
OH, NO. YOU CAN'T. YOUR NECK'S
LIKE A TREE TRUNK, MAN.

16:11.201 --> 16:13.973
YOU KNOW, WHEN MY WIFE
LEFT ME... (clears throat)

16:13.973 --> 16:15.375
I BRAVE-FACED IT, TOO.

16:15.375 --> 16:19.109
BECAUSE WE BOTH HAVE A PAIR,
AND THAT'S HOW WE ROLL.

16:19.109 --> 16:21.411
YEAH, I WASN'T BRAGGING. IT WAS
THE WORST TIME OF MY LIFE.

16:21.411 --> 16:23.683
YOU KNOW, THE BEST THING
ABOUT BEING A PART

16:23.683 --> 16:25.685
OF THIS...
(mutters) CUL-DE-SAC CREW...

16:25.685 --> 16:29.119
(normal voice) IS THAT THERE'S
ALWAYS SOMEONE THERE FOR YOU.

16:29.119 --> 16:32.122
AND, YES, IT HURTS MY TEETH TO
LEAN ON SOMEONE, BUT I WOULDN'T

16:32.122 --> 16:35.195
TRADE THIS GROUP FOR ANYTHING.
WE ALL TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.427
OH. ANDY, IF YOU TAKE BOBBY
TO THE DOCTOR,

16:37.427 --> 16:40.170
I'M GOING TO RIP OFF
YOUR WHISTLE

16:40.170 --> 16:43.673
AND FEED IT TO A BIRD!

16:43.673 --> 16:46.206
WE TAKE SO MUCH CARE
OF EACH OTHER.

16:48.038 --> 16:50.780
DWAYNE, YOU CAN SEE THIS HOUSE
AS MANY TIMES AS YOU LIKE.

16:50.780 --> 16:54.344
LET'S JUST HOPE
THE TENTH TIME IS A CHARM.
WE'LL SEE.

16:54.344 --> 16:56.446
(chuckles) OKAY.
(under breath) DIE.

16:56.446 --> 16:58.488
WHY'D YOU TELL ANDY
NOT TO HELP ME?

16:58.488 --> 17:00.650
BECAUSE IF I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO HELP YOU, THEN...

17:00.650 --> 17:02.592
(both) WHY SHOULD HE GET TO?

17:02.592 --> 17:06.326
YOU SEE? (chuckles) I KNOW YOU
JUST AS WELL AS YOU KNOW ME.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.798
AND I'VE BEEN THINKING, YOU'RE
ALWAYS SO QUICK TO HELP ME OUT,

17:08.798 --> 17:11.731
BUT YOU NEVER REALLY WANT ME
TO HELP YOU--

17:11.731 --> 17:14.134
NOT WITH THE CLIENTS,
NOT WITH WORK, NOTHING.

17:14.134 --> 17:17.437
DWAYNE-O!
HOW'S IT HANGIN', BABY?
WHOO!

17:17.437 --> 17:20.810
WHOO!
SERIOUSLY?

17:20.810 --> 17:23.073
(door closes)

17:23.073 --> 17:25.145
PUT YOUR HAND UP.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.276
BACKBOARD.

17:26.276 --> 17:28.578
(clank)
THAT'S INSANE!

17:28.578 --> 17:32.152
THAT'S WHO I AM NOW, TRAVIS--
PENNY-THROWING DUMMY.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.783
NO-LOOK.

17:33.783 --> 17:36.786
(clank)
ONE OF MY MOM'S LISTS. LOOK.
"SMARTEST PEOPLE I KNOW."

17:36.786 --> 17:40.360
YOU AND ME--
STILL RIGHT ON TOP.
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO
TO THAT MOVIE WITH YOU.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.362
I HATE DOCUMENTARIES.
THEY'RE TOO PREACHY,

17:42.362 --> 17:45.365
AND YOU CAN'T CLAP WHEN
SOMEONE DIES, 'CAUSE IT'S REAL.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.367
YEAH, I HATE 'EM, TOO.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.369
I JUST LIKE EVERYONE
TO THINK I LOVE THEM.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.401
THAT WAY I CAN STILL FEEL
ABOVE IT ALL

17:51.401 --> 17:54.104
WHEN I BEGRUDGINGLY DO
STUFF LIKE THIS. NO-LOOK.

17:54.104 --> 17:55.675
(high-pitched voice) AH!

17:55.675 --> 17:58.108
(normal voice)
I'LL REPLACE THAT.

17:58.108 --> 18:01.111
WE'RE BRILLIANT ON A LEVEL
THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN COMPREHEND.
HOW?

18:01.111 --> 18:03.613
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FAKE
BEING SMART AND SUPERIOR,

18:03.613 --> 18:06.186
EVEN THOUGH
WE DON'T FEEL IT IN HERE.

18:06.186 --> 18:09.289
I LOVE PRETENDING THAT
I'M BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.522
WHO DO YOU THINK
I GOT IT FROM?
(whispers) OHH.

18:15.525 --> 18:17.527
WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

18:17.527 --> 18:19.529
WE JUST WATCHED, UH,
"GOOD WILL HUNTING,"

18:19.529 --> 18:20.570
AND ANDY WANTS TO TRY
SOMETHING.

18:20.570 --> 18:22.772
OKAY. READY? ROBIN WILLIAMS,

18:22.772 --> 18:25.605
BIG, BUSHY BEARD,
BAD BOSTON ACCENT.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.106
BEGIN.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.609
(imitates Boston accent)
LAURIE, I DON'T KNOW A LOT,

18:29.609 --> 18:32.111
BUT THIS WHOLE THING
WITH YOU AND SMITH--

18:32.111 --> 18:34.113
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.615
I KNOW.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.847
NO. LOOK AT ME, SON.

18:37.847 --> 18:39.349
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

18:39.349 --> 18:41.491
I KNOW.

18:41.491 --> 18:45.195
NO, NO. YOU DON'T. NANU, NANU.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

18:45.195 --> 18:48.198
ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS?
JUST KIDDING AROUND.

18:48.198 --> 18:50.200
WHAT DID YOU THINK
WAS GONNA HAPPEN?

18:50.200 --> 18:52.202
THAT I'D START LAUGHING
AND THEN ALL OF SUDDEN

18:52.202 --> 18:55.265
I WOULD JUST GET SO COMFORTABLE,
I'D BE REAL WITH YOU GUYS,

18:55.265 --> 18:56.766
MAYBE TALK ABOUT

18:56.766 --> 18:59.769
HOW SMITH AND I USED TO WATCH
MOVIES ON HIS BIG, COMFY COUCH,

18:59.769 --> 19:03.213
AND WHEN I WOULD GET ALL SLEEPY,
HE'D PUT A PILLOW ON HIS CHEST

19:03.213 --> 19:06.216
SO THAT I COULD PUT
MY HEAD THERE AND...
(both mouth words)

19:06.216 --> 19:09.749
(whispers) I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M NEVER GONNA DO THAT AGAIN.

19:09.749 --> 19:12.922
(voice breaking) THERE.
YOU GUYS GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.

19:12.922 --> 19:15.425
ARE YOU HAPPY?
YES.

19:15.425 --> 19:17.687
NO.
NO.

19:17.687 --> 19:19.929
WHY?
WHY WON'T HE LOVE ME?

19:19.929 --> 19:22.161
I DO NOT KNOW.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.164
(crying)
CUL-DE-SAC CREW ON THREE.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.866
ONE, TWO, THREE.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.699
(all) CUL-DE-SAC CREW.

19:29.699 --> 19:32.372
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:32.372 --> 19:34.574
GREAT VIEW, HUH?

19:34.574 --> 19:38.378
OH, THE FISH
ARE REALLY JUMPIN'.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.681
MUST BE A MONSTER SHNOOK,
RIGHT? (chuckles)

19:41.681 --> 19:44.584
I LOVE ME A SHNOOK.

19:44.584 --> 19:48.218
BUT NO ONE LOVES A SNOOK.
THEY'RE MEAN.

19:48.218 --> 19:51.261
MAYBE I DO LIKE
THAT YOU STILL NEED ME

19:51.261 --> 19:54.424
AND THAT I DON'T NEED YOU
ANYMORE...

19:54.424 --> 19:58.197
AND THAT I GET TO RUB IT
IN YOUR FACE.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.871
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
YOU STILL HAVEN'T FORGIVEN ME

20:01.871 --> 20:04.704
FOR SCREWING US UP
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.206
I PROBABLY HAVEN'T.
I MEAN, WE WERE MARRIED,

20:07.206 --> 20:10.540
AND WE HAD A KID,
AND YOU ROYNED IT.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.342
ROYNED IT.

20:12.342 --> 20:15.345
I KNOW.

20:15.345 --> 20:18.848
JULES, I LOVE THE FACT
THAT YOU LOOK OUT FOR ME,

20:18.848 --> 20:22.752
BUT SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA LET ME
HELP YOU. JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE.

20:22.752 --> 20:24.694
I'LL TRY.

20:24.694 --> 20:27.827
I KNOW I CAN SELL THAT HOUSE
TO THAT DUDE.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.560
HE'S MY PEOPLE.
TAG ME IN, COACH!

20:30.560 --> 20:34.434
OKAY. FINE. HELP ME.

20:34.434 --> 20:37.437
OH. YOU'RE WAITING FOR ME
TO ACTUALLY TAG YOU IN?

20:37.437 --> 20:38.938
YES, I AM.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.440
OKAY. COME ON.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.413
OH! OH! OH! OH!
KNOCK 'EM OUT!
GO GET 'EM. YEAH!

20:43.413 --> 20:44.914
HEY, BIG DWAYNE!

20:44.914 --> 20:47.917
LET ME TELL YOU
WHY YOU AND YOUR MAMA

20:47.917 --> 20:50.880
SHOULD BUY THIS HOUSE.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.384
THAT LADY WASN'T HIS MAMA.

20:54.384 --> 20:55.985
IT WAS HIS WIFE.

20:55.985 --> 20:57.857
OHH. YOU DID NOT?

20:57.857 --> 21:00.290
(laughs)

21:00.290 --> 21:02.592
(laughs) OH, BOBBY!

21:08.538 --> 21:09.769
HUHH!

21:09.769 --> 21:11.270
HI-YAH!

21:11.270 --> 21:13.002
HAAH!

21:13.002 --> 21:13.903
(laughs)

21:13.903 --> 21:16.576
SHOWED ALL THE BOYS
OUR SECRET.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.677
GREAT.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.679
YOU MAY HAVE RUINED GOLF.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.411
YUP.
OH, MY GOODNESS.

21:21.411 --> 21:23.413
OH, NO, HE DID NOT.

21:23.413 --> 21:27.357
OH, STOP IT. I LOOK MARVELOUS.
LET'S HIT SOME BALLS.
(laughs)

21:30.920 --> 21:33.623
HI-EE!

21:33.623 --> 21:35.064
WHOA!

21:35.064 --> 21:36.826
HUH-YA-YA!

21:36.826 --> 21:38.027
(whack)
(man) HUH-YAH!
