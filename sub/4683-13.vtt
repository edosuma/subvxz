WEBVTT

00:20.366 --> 00:21.500
I'll be back!

00:21.566 --> 00:22.866
I'm free!

02:48.833 --> 02:50.300
Peter.

02:50.366 --> 02:52.500
You were supposed
to meet me for lunch.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.900
Is it noon already?

02:54.966 --> 02:57.266
No, it's 2 o'clock.

02:57.333 --> 03:00.833
I'm sorry, Annie, it's just that
when I started writing these..

03:00.900 --> 03:03.066
Well, I didn't realize
what time it was.

03:03.133 --> 03:04.633
Well, at least there's one guy

03:04.700 --> 03:06.433
in Springwood High
that's got some ambition.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.533
Yeah, all the other guys we know
are just spending the summer

03:08.600 --> 03:10.400
lying around the house,
or going on vacation.

03:10.466 --> 03:11.733
Hey, weren't you talking
about taking

03:11.800 --> 03:13.266
this summer off to see
some of the world?

03:13.333 --> 03:16.100
Yeah, but my father thinks that
this is as much of the world

03:16.166 --> 03:17.500
as I need to see.

03:17.566 --> 03:19.466
And as publisher
of the "Springwood Star Times"

03:19.533 --> 03:22.000
'he had no problem
getting me this greatjob'

03:22.066 --> 03:23.433
'sitting behind
the desk all summer.'

03:23.500 --> 03:26.033
Your dad just wants you to learn
about the newspaper business.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.300
But I don't wanna learn
about the newspaper business.

03:28.366 --> 03:29.300
I wanna write.

03:29.366 --> 03:31.166
Well, you've done more
about writing here

03:31.233 --> 03:32.733
than you would off
on some island out there.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.733
Typing up obituaries, no way.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.466
This stuff is so boring.
I wanna write about people.

03:37.533 --> 03:39.166
You know, what they think
and what they feel.

03:39.233 --> 03:41.600
I wanna write about life!
Not death.

03:41.666 --> 03:42.966
Who died?

03:43.033 --> 03:44.533
Anthony Lawrence.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.800
Hey, isn't he that
really good-looking guy

03:46.866 --> 03:48.600
who sells cars
at Springwood Motors?

03:48.666 --> 03:51.633
Right! And-and he's always
driving a new car every week.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.766
'Well, last night
he took his last free ride.'

03:53.833 --> 03:56.300
Right off a cliff,
about a hundred miles an hour.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.866
Can you imagine how he fel
going off that cliff?

03:58.933 --> 04:01.766
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:01.833 --> 04:04.100
What a way to go!

04:09.433 --> 04:11.133
What a terrible, awful

04:11.200 --> 04:13.066
awfulway to go.

04:13.133 --> 04:15.800
Hey, come on, guys, I don't
wanna talk about this anymore.

04:15.866 --> 04:17.766
Oh, relax,
you're only 16 years old.

04:17.833 --> 04:20.133
- You've nothing to worry about.
- Almost 17.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.000
Annie, you're too young to die.
We all are.

04:22.066 --> 04:24.600
Nobody's too young.
Not in this town.

04:24.666 --> 04:26.033
Yeah, remember Freddy Krueger?

04:26.100 --> 04:27.333
I think he's dead by now.

04:29.566 --> 04:32.333
'"Krueger, Freddy."
See, he's still around.'

04:32.400 --> 04:34.366
'This is just his file
that's still around.'

04:34.433 --> 04:36.500
What scares me is the way
he just sort of disappeared.

04:36.566 --> 04:39.933
Watch this, all I have to do
is push this one little button.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.733
And it's bye-bye,
Freddy Krueger.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.100
The guy is yesterday's news.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.700
- Feel better?
- Yeah.

04:46.433 --> 04:48.100
See you later.

04:56.166 --> 05:00.233
If our little cub reporter
is so bored by this story

05:00.300 --> 05:03.666
I'll give him something
that'll really charge him up.

05:09.133 --> 05:11.400
Well, Peter,
this is really very effective.

05:11.466 --> 05:13.633
Reading this I feel
as if I know exactly

05:13.700 --> 05:17.200
what Anthony Lawrence felt like
when he went over the cliff.

05:18.566 --> 05:21.733
Unfortunately, what I don't know
is the exact time of death.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.133
I don't have the coroner's
official cause of death.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.233
And I don't know where
this funeral is being held

05:26.300 --> 05:29.133
Well, I-I thought
we should be more creative.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.833
You know, give it
the human touch.

05:31.900 --> 05:34.200
Well, you're not here
to be human.

05:34.266 --> 05:37.000
You're here to learn the basics
of newspaper reporting.

05:37.066 --> 05:40.166
So when you're done
re-writing this..

05:40.233 --> 05:42.366
...I want you
to start in on this one.

05:42.433 --> 05:44.633
Anderson just phoned it in
from the police station.

05:46.866 --> 05:49.066
Is something wrong?

05:49.133 --> 05:51.900
Yeah, I used to go
to Doc Wendell when I was a kid.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.066
Anderson's down
at the police station

05:55.133 --> 05:57.800
waiting for the cops
to finish their official report.

05:57.866 --> 06:00.833
He will cover the story
if there's any crime angle

06:00.900 --> 06:03.200
If not...you get
to write the obit.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.533
Oh, remember, there's
a 2:00 a.m. deadline on this

06:06.600 --> 06:08.533
for the morning edition.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.533
Oh, and, Peter, please..

06:15.600 --> 06:17.200
...do not get creative.

06:32.833 --> 06:34.900
'Hello? Hello, it's Anderson.'

06:34.966 --> 06:36.833
'Come on, somebody pick up.'

06:38.633 --> 06:40.866
"Springwood Star Times."
Ellis here.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.333
'Yeah, Peter, uh, the coroner's
report on Dr. Wendell'

06:43.400 --> 06:45.500
'lists natural causes,
you know, cardiac arrest.'

06:45.566 --> 06:47.900
'So, you go ahead
and you write up the obit.'

07:36.833 --> 07:38.400
What's up, doc?

07:40.366 --> 07:43.900
You'd figure that a girl who
is...smart enough to graduate

07:43.966 --> 07:46.233
at the top
of your nursing class..

07:46.300 --> 07:48.066
...wouldn't be dumb
enough to fool around

07:48.133 --> 07:50.033
and end up falling in love.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.300
But you're always making
one more promise..

08:02.700 --> 08:04.900
...and then always breaking it.

08:08.266 --> 08:11.833
And then once you
got hold of her heart..

08:11.900 --> 08:14.600
...you just wouldn't let it go.

08:14.666 --> 08:16.633
Always squeezing it.

08:16.700 --> 08:19.066
Tighter and tighter.

08:19.133 --> 08:22.300
Until finally...it broke.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.333
Nothing can stop the pain.

08:30.400 --> 08:33.733
Unfortunately, there's no cure
for a broken heart.

08:33.800 --> 08:36.266
Nothing can stop the pain.

08:41.833 --> 08:44.466
'So how does it feel, doc?'

08:44.533 --> 08:47.933
'Getting a little taste
of your own medicine?'

09:06.633 --> 09:09.400
- Hey! Hey, kid, are you okay?
- Yeah!

09:09.466 --> 09:12.166
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

09:12.233 --> 09:13.233
Where's the Wendell obit?

09:14.800 --> 09:16.833
I just finished it. Here.

09:16.900 --> 09:18.500
Alright, then don't sweat it.

09:18.566 --> 09:19.833
At least you beat
the deadline, right?

09:19.900 --> 09:21.533
Right, right!

09:21.600 --> 09:23.600
And that's all
that matters anyway, right?

09:25.100 --> 09:26.633
Uh..

09:26.700 --> 09:27.700
Do you know I could've gone
to the mall

09:27.766 --> 09:28.766
with Emily and Starr?

09:28.833 --> 09:30.100
Then why didn't you?

09:30.166 --> 09:32.566
Because my boyfriend calls me up
at 3 o'clock in the morning

09:32.633 --> 09:35.400
and says he feels
like he's gonna die.

09:35.466 --> 09:38.166
- You just had a nightmare.
- This wasn't any dream.

09:38.233 --> 09:40.600
I was sitting in my computer,
writing Doc Wendell's obit

09:40.666 --> 09:43.033
when something
really weird happened.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.966
All of a sudden,
I wasn't in the newsroom

09:45.033 --> 09:46.733
but in Doc Wendell's office.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.466
You'd rather be anywhere
than at that newsroom.

09:48.533 --> 09:51.500
And I wasn't just writing
about how Doc Wendell died

09:51.566 --> 09:53.366
I was actually feeling it.

09:53.433 --> 09:55.633
It was like this big tank
was rolling right over my chest

09:55.700 --> 09:57.800
and my arm went totally numb
and I could hardly breathe.

09:57.866 --> 10:00.333
Come on, Peter, you know that
17-year-olds don't go around

10:00.400 --> 10:01.566
havin' heart attacks!

10:01.633 --> 10:03.166
Annie, I was scared.

10:03.233 --> 10:05.533
I was really scared.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.266
What would've happened
if I hadn't written Doc Wendell

10:07.333 --> 10:10.266
back into the obit
and me out in time?

10:10.333 --> 10:11.733
Well, that's a great story.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.866
- A real cliffhanger.
- What?

10:13.933 --> 10:16.733
Much better than anything you
ever wrote for English class.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.333
You think I made all that up?

10:19.400 --> 10:21.133
Why would I do that?

10:21.200 --> 10:22.666
To make your dad think
you flipped out

10:22.733 --> 10:25.566
so he'll let you take
a trip around the world.

10:25.633 --> 10:29.000
And then you can get away
from the paper and Springwood..

10:29.066 --> 10:30.666
...and me.

10:30.733 --> 10:33.400
And I think you can catch up
with your friends at the mall.

10:35.466 --> 10:36.900
Peter..
Peter, wait!

10:38.500 --> 10:39.633
I'm sorry.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.700
It's just that sometimes..

10:41.766 --> 10:43.233
...your writing seems
so important to you

10:43.300 --> 10:45.633
that I get afraid
one day it'll take you away.

10:47.466 --> 10:49.800
And I just don't wanna lose you.

10:49.866 --> 10:53.200
Yeah? Well, don't worry,
I'm not going anywhere.

10:56.933 --> 10:59.166
Well, I guess
you'd better be getting back.

10:59.233 --> 11:00.866
You don't wanna get in trouble
with your boss.

11:00.933 --> 11:02.433
Yeah.

11:02.500 --> 11:06.100
The movie starts at 8:00,
so I'll pick you up at 7:30.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.400
That is if you still
wanna be my fella.

11:11.833 --> 11:13.566
I like this. It's great.

11:13.633 --> 11:14.933
It's very good.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.300
Peter, I need you
to jump on this right away.

11:18.366 --> 11:19.633
Shouldn't Anderson write this?

11:19.700 --> 11:21.133
- No.
- He's your crime reporter.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.000
He's busy on another story

11:23.066 --> 11:24.466
And I'm up against the deadline.

11:24.533 --> 11:26.633
Please, Miss Brandes,
let me write something else.

11:26.700 --> 11:29.133
Please, anything else,
classifieds or subscriptions?

11:29.200 --> 11:31.700
The "Springwood Star Times
does not hire teenagers

11:31.766 --> 11:34.566
so that they can play reporter
for the summer.

11:34.633 --> 11:37.400
But your father
is the publisher so..

11:37.466 --> 11:38.766
...here you are.

11:38.833 --> 11:41.166
Now, if you were smart..

11:41.233 --> 11:42.933
...you'd take advantage
of this opportunity

11:43.000 --> 11:44.666
and you'd learn
from experienced writers

11:44.733 --> 11:46.933
like myself and Anderson.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.300
You know, getting an A
in creative writing

11:49.366 --> 11:50.866
doesn't exactly qualify yo

11:50.933 --> 11:53.566
as the next Ernest Hemingway.

11:53.633 --> 11:56.900
Who, by the way,
was one hell of a reporter

11:56.966 --> 11:58.233
Good work.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.300
Well, Mr. Finney..

12:26.866 --> 12:29.666
...we talked to
your son at the bank.

12:29.733 --> 12:31.733
We told him how much
the ransom would be.

12:33.633 --> 12:35.333
But he wants to negotiate.

12:37.533 --> 12:40.200
Seems you taught him
everything's negotiable.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.133
Now..

12:45.566 --> 12:47.466
...I don't know how much
bank presidents

12:47.533 --> 12:49.233
are going for these days.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.600
I think we set
a pretty fair price.

12:53.666 --> 12:55.466
But you financial wizards,
you always

12:55.533 --> 12:57.866
gotta bargain and deal.

12:57.933 --> 13:00.300
Make sure you get your pound
of flesh, huh?

13:02.266 --> 13:04.066
Well..

13:04.133 --> 13:06.300
...why don't we give him
that pound of flesh?

13:08.600 --> 13:10.100
Yours.

13:11.766 --> 13:14.866
Now we gotta pick a good piece,
don't we?

13:14.933 --> 13:17.800
Something Gerald Finney Jr.
will recognize

13:17.866 --> 13:19.933
is his dear old dad's.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.533
Now we could cut off
a finger, couldn't we?

13:32.766 --> 13:34.466
Then they'll have to check
the prints to make sure

13:34.533 --> 13:36.500
it really was yours,
wouldn't they?

13:39.700 --> 13:42.800
Or how about something bigger?
Like your arm, huh?

13:46.966 --> 13:48.333
What is this?

13:48.400 --> 13:49.700
A tattoo?

13:56.366 --> 13:58.366
There's no way you could've
belonged to the Black Adders

13:58.433 --> 13:59.866
not unless they started
making Harleys

13:59.933 --> 14:01.933
with training wheels, huh?

14:05.233 --> 14:08.266
I don't suppose you were
in the Marine Corps, were you?

14:08.333 --> 14:11.700
Now, guys like you...spend
all your time in college

14:11.766 --> 14:14.000
instead of fighting
for your country.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.266
Oh..

14:20.333 --> 14:23.833
...now I know what it is.
It's a big, fat dollar sign.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.933
Cut it off.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.133
You finished with the Finney
obituary yet?

14:45.200 --> 14:46.400
Yes, I finished.

14:56.266 --> 14:57.733
There's no time
to clean up your desk.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.766
I'm not cleaning it up,
I'm cleaning it out.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.900
I need this
for this evening's edition.

15:01.966 --> 15:04.400
It shouldn't be a problem,
it's a simple suicide.

15:04.466 --> 15:05.633
He even left a note.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.400
No! I don't wanna see it.

15:08.466 --> 15:10.100
Well, if you don't read it,
how are you gonna know

15:10.166 --> 15:11.133
why he killed himself?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.800
I don't care
why he killed himself.

15:13.866 --> 15:15.533
Oh, I get it, of course.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.733
A creative genius like you
is bound to find something

15:17.800 --> 15:19.200
much better than the facts

15:19.266 --> 15:20.933
No way. I quit.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.966
I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna
pack my bags and I'm gonna split

15:24.033 --> 15:25.400
for the summer
just like I planned.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.233
I'm sorry, Peter.

15:27.300 --> 15:30.800
But your father has other plans
for you and so do I.

15:30.866 --> 15:34.100
I'm gonna start running
your obituaries in a special box

15:34.166 --> 15:35.966
on the front page.

15:36.033 --> 15:37.866
Experience the fear
and pain of death

15:37.933 --> 15:40.800
with none of the hassles,
without ever having to leave

15:40.866 --> 15:43.400
the comfort of your own
living room.

15:43.466 --> 15:45.133
Goodbye, Miss Brandes.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.700
Peter, you cannot quit!

15:47.900 --> 15:49.966
Please, try and understand

15:50.033 --> 15:52.000
This job is killing me!

16:11.033 --> 16:12.733
Get off me!

16:13.766 --> 16:15.266
Oh, God.

16:15.333 --> 16:18.900
Thank you, officer.
Just put him over there.

16:18.966 --> 16:20.400
Get off me!

16:28.133 --> 16:30.466
I didn't commit any crime.

16:30.533 --> 16:32.800
When you walked out that door,
you tried to steal

16:32.866 --> 16:36.166
a very valuable piece
of office equipment.

16:36.233 --> 16:38.000
'That wonderfully
creative mind of yours.'

16:38.066 --> 16:40.133
This is crazy!

16:40.200 --> 16:43.500
I just need you to write
this last obituary for me.

16:43.566 --> 16:44.866
I won't do it.

16:44.933 --> 16:47.466
Well, the computer
won't do it alone.

16:47.533 --> 16:50.233
You can't keep me locked up
in here forever.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.133
You can't keep me locked up
in here forever!

16:53.200 --> 16:55.600
No, just till deadline.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.633
"Loan due."

17:56.466 --> 17:58.500
But I can't pay.
I don't have any money.

18:01.033 --> 18:03.033
Unless the bank
could make me another loan.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.133
How about another roll the dice?

18:28.366 --> 18:30.400
"Foreclosure."

18:30.466 --> 18:32.100
That means I'm bankrupt.

18:42.433 --> 18:43.533
Bust.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.333
Broke.

19:07.433 --> 19:08.533
"Jump."

19:42.733 --> 19:45.933
So...I guess this means
the game is over.

20:04.833 --> 20:08.733
Peter, it's 7:30, time to return
to the land of the living.

20:08.800 --> 20:09.866
Annie, wait, I can't leave.

20:09.933 --> 20:11.266
Peter, we're gonna be late
for the movie.

20:11.333 --> 20:14.033
No! I can't go anywhere until
I finish writing this obit.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.000
Peter! You don't even
like this job.

20:17.066 --> 20:19.233
So why you killing yoursel
over it?

20:22.166 --> 20:24.300
Annie, my God, do you realize
what you've done?

20:24.366 --> 20:25.500
Peter, calm down.

20:25.566 --> 20:28.766
That's it. That's it.
Over and out, I'm dead.

20:28.833 --> 20:30.233
I can't make
the deadline by now.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.100
There's no way I can finish.

20:32.166 --> 20:33.433
You don't have any deadline.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.966
Hey, I took over
the Finney obituary

20:35.033 --> 20:36.233
'when they arrested
the kidnappers.'

20:36.300 --> 20:37.866
I'm gonna be stuck out
on that ledge.

20:37.933 --> 20:40.733
I'm gonna jump instead
of the real estate millionaire.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.933
What real estate millionaire?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.833
The one who killed himself.

20:46.633 --> 20:49.466
Either you're doing one hell
of a number on me..

20:49.533 --> 20:51.866
...or you really need a rest.

20:51.933 --> 20:54.900
Listen, I want you to take
the rest of the weekend.

20:54.966 --> 20:55.900
You alright? You understand?

20:55.966 --> 20:57.066
Peter, look,
it's Saturday night.

20:57.133 --> 20:58.100
Why don't you two kids

20:58.166 --> 20:59.200
you know, get out
of here, you go

20:59.266 --> 21:01.000
and you have a good time, huh?

21:01.066 --> 21:02.400
Peter, come on.

21:02.466 --> 21:05.433
Miss Brandes, please,
you don't understand.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.700
Explain it to me
on Monday, okay?

21:07.766 --> 21:10.933
I don't want to see your face
in this newsroom until then.

21:13.433 --> 21:15.233
Okay? Go ahead.

21:19.066 --> 21:21.533
Kid's imagination is gonna be
the death of him, huh?

21:21.600 --> 21:23.133
Yeah.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.366
Wait till your dad
hears about this.

21:25.433 --> 21:26.933
His kid fries his brain

21:27.000 --> 21:28.733
staring at the computer
all day.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.266
You know,
you've gotten kinda weird

21:30.333 --> 21:31.433
since you started this job

21:31.500 --> 21:32.766
I don't know, maybe

21:32.833 --> 21:33.933
it's just sitting there
and writing

21:34.000 --> 21:36.166
about dead people all day
that's done it.

21:36.233 --> 21:38.900
But you're just not
very much fun anymore.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.433
I mean, it's Saturday night.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.800
We're stuck in this elevator
when we could be

21:43.866 --> 21:46.700
out buying popcorn
at the movies.

21:46.766 --> 21:47.966
Which you gonna miss
unless this thing

21:48.033 --> 21:50.700
drops all 20 floors.

21:50.766 --> 21:53.233
Oh, you know what?
I forgot my wallet and my key.

21:53.300 --> 21:56.066
You go on down to the lobby,
I'll meet you there.

21:56.133 --> 21:57.800
You are just too weird.

22:28.466 --> 22:29.633
Peter!

22:34.133 --> 22:36.333
Here today.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.766
'Deadline, TheM

23:16.866 --> 23:17.833
Emily?

23:19.566 --> 23:20.533
Emily?

23:21.400 --> 23:22.466
Emily?

23:22.533 --> 23:24.933
Up and at 'em.
Breakfast is on the table.

23:42.133 --> 23:43.233
Great pancakes.

23:43.300 --> 23:45.466
Now they did an entire hour
on pancakes

23:45.533 --> 23:47.166
on "Good Morning Springwood."

23:47.233 --> 23:48.466
You know, I think
adding the two cups

23:48.533 --> 23:50.733
of mayonnaise really
made a big difference.

23:51.633 --> 23:53.600
Oh, Emily, aren't you hungry?

23:53.666 --> 23:54.833
Not very.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.366
'Probably the medication.'

23:56.433 --> 23:58.666
How long do I have to keep
taking those pills?

23:58.733 --> 24:00.900
Well, honey, the doctor said
you need your sleep.

24:02.333 --> 24:04.233
Yeah, but she's gotta eat too.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.633
Oh, will you take a look
at these roses?

24:11.700 --> 24:14.433
'It's amazing what they can do
with plastics these days.'

24:14.500 --> 24:15.733
'They last forever.'

24:15.800 --> 24:18.433
Starr would have loved
the flowers at her funeral.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.100
And Annie..

24:22.900 --> 24:25.433
Do you remember how beautiful
she looked lying there?

24:26.200 --> 24:27.500
So peaceful.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.100
Here, honey.

24:30.966 --> 24:33.533
No, they make me so tired.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.100
But at least if you're asleep,
you don't feel so upset.

24:37.433 --> 24:39.433
No, I don't feel anything.

24:40.066 --> 24:41.133
Here.

25:06.866 --> 25:08.566
I'm not supposed to be here.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.766
This is a great party.

25:10.833 --> 25:13.433
It wouldn't be any fun
if we weren't all here together.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.033
I've got to find him.

25:19.133 --> 25:21.100
- Find who?
- Peter.

25:21.166 --> 25:22.733
Annie, Peter's not here.

25:23.566 --> 25:24.900
He's dead.

25:25.666 --> 25:27.100
Peter?

25:39.933 --> 25:42.933
Emily, come back!

26:11.166 --> 26:13.800
Isn't it all exactly
what you dreamed?

26:14.800 --> 26:16.400
Who are you?

26:16.466 --> 26:18.633
Exactly what you dreamed.

26:19.466 --> 26:21.100
Now close your eyes.

26:22.066 --> 26:23.533
Give me your hand.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.200
You know the way.

26:44.266 --> 26:46.900
You've been here
so many times before.

26:51.833 --> 26:54.633
No, don't leave me, please,
I don't wanna be alone.

26:59.733 --> 27:00.933
Emily, wake up.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.033
Nobody sleeps
at a slumber party.

27:03.100 --> 27:04.700
And who were you dreaming about?

27:04.766 --> 27:06.766
- Nobody.
- Nobody, huh?

27:06.833 --> 27:08.766
We'll see.

27:08.833 --> 27:09.800
Hey.

27:11.566 --> 27:13.933
This the Mr. Wonderful
we've been hearing about?

27:14.766 --> 27:17.533
Yes. This is Johnny.

27:18.633 --> 27:20.533
Isn't he the cutest guy
in the whole world?

27:21.433 --> 27:22.733
'I know, it sounds ridiculous'

27:22.800 --> 27:25.133
but I just can't stop
thinking about him.

27:25.200 --> 27:28.333
It's not ridiculous.
That's how I felt with Peter.

27:28.400 --> 27:31.200
'Awake, asleep, he was all
I ever thought about.'

27:31.266 --> 27:35.033
But since Peter died,
I've kinda given up on dreaming.

27:36.866 --> 27:39.433
'Emily, turn down that music.'

27:40.600 --> 27:42.133
- Hey, dad.
- 'Goodnight, girls.'

27:42.200 --> 27:43.700
Goodnight, mom.

27:43.766 --> 27:45.733
Have, uh, have they met him yet?

27:47.100 --> 27:49.533
Johnny? No.

27:49.600 --> 27:50.733
Somehow I just don't think

27:50.800 --> 27:52.700
my parents would approve
of an older guy.

27:52.766 --> 27:54.033
Maybe they're right.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.233
Annie!

27:57.300 --> 27:59.700
Oh, no, I can't believe
I actually said that.

28:00.566 --> 28:01.933
'You know, I think I'm jealous.'

28:02.000 --> 28:03.066
Of what?

28:03.133 --> 28:04.066
The way you still believe

28:04.133 --> 28:05.200
in all those love songs

28:05.266 --> 28:06.900
and happily ever after.

28:06.966 --> 28:08.666
You really loved Peter,
didn't you?

28:08.733 --> 28:10.566
'Yeah, I did.'

28:10.633 --> 28:13.500
But after he died,
it hurts so bad

28:13.566 --> 28:16.533
I-I made up my mind never
to love anybody like that again.

28:17.033 --> 28:18.800
Ever!

28:18.866 --> 28:21.600
Well, maybe that'll change
when you find the right someone.

28:21.666 --> 28:23.300
Like you do with Johnny?

28:23.366 --> 28:24.300
Yeah.

28:34.366 --> 28:36.300
Look, what I found.

28:38.466 --> 28:41.466
Some real hot stuff in here.

28:41.533 --> 28:44.100
All about her dream lover.

28:44.166 --> 28:46.433
A real lady killer.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.666
'So, Katrina's dad
hired a caterer'

28:54.733 --> 28:56.566
and two security guards
for the party.

28:56.633 --> 28:59.333
Which means great food
and no crashers.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.100
So we'll pick you up about 8:00?

29:01.166 --> 29:02.800
I'm not gonna go to the party.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.866
Well, Johnny asked me out.

29:05.933 --> 29:08.166
Well, ask Katrina
if you can bring him along

29:08.233 --> 29:09.633
Come on, Emily, it'll be fun.

29:09.700 --> 29:11.133
Why can't you just go
without me?

29:11.200 --> 29:13.366
Because it's always been
the three of us.

29:13.433 --> 29:15.300
Our whole lives.

29:15.366 --> 29:17.533
Whenever we do anything,
we did it together.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.233
Every step of the way
we took it together.

29:19.300 --> 29:22.500
But now all of a sudden
you wanna go off on your own.

29:22.566 --> 29:24.433
I just wanna be alone
with Johnny.

29:24.500 --> 29:27.033
Caterers and security guards
don't sound very romantic.

29:30.766 --> 29:32.700
And I guess a college guy
wouldn't have much fun

29:32.766 --> 29:34.966
at a party with a bunch
of high school kids like us.

29:35.033 --> 29:36.800
No, I didn't say that.

29:36.866 --> 29:38.300
You didn't have to.

29:40.766 --> 29:42.100
Starr..

29:47.900 --> 29:50.100
Maybe we're just not
your friends anymore.

29:50.166 --> 29:51.700
Maybe we never really were.

29:51.766 --> 29:54.666
Don't say that, Annie.
That.. You are my friend.

29:54.733 --> 29:56.600
You'll always be my friend

30:14.600 --> 30:17.300
He loves me, he loves me not.

30:17.366 --> 30:19.900
He loves me, he loves me not.

30:21.300 --> 30:22.500
He loves me.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.500
Hello, Emily.

30:31.233 --> 30:32.900
I knew you'd be back.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.600
This is what you want.

30:37.366 --> 30:38.900
Isn't it, Emily?

30:38.966 --> 30:40.266
Yes.

30:40.333 --> 30:42.100
To be with your friends.

30:43.366 --> 30:44.900
My friends?

30:44.966 --> 30:48.633
Always is a very long time.

30:48.700 --> 30:50.833
I have to be sure
that you're really ready.

30:56.100 --> 30:59.100
Yes. Yes, I'm ready.

31:02.633 --> 31:04.700
No, please, no!

31:13.166 --> 31:14.233
You were snoring.

31:14.300 --> 31:15.900
Oh, no,
I must have fallen asleep.

31:15.966 --> 31:17.433
I didn't get much sleep
last night either.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.833
You missed a great party.

31:18.900 --> 31:20.366
Of course our folks
really freaked out

31:20.433 --> 31:21.700
when they heard
about the accident.

31:21.766 --> 31:23.000
It was an accident.

31:23.066 --> 31:24.833
That's what I told them,
but they wouldn't listen.

31:24.900 --> 31:26.233
They never listen.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.033
Okay, that's not important.

31:28.100 --> 31:29.900
Tell us about your date
with Johnny.

31:29.966 --> 31:31.900
Wait, what about the accident?

31:33.366 --> 31:35.866
If you don't wanna tell us
about him, just say so.

31:35.933 --> 31:37.866
- No, it's not that. I--
- Yes, it is.

31:37.933 --> 31:40.633
We're just not a part
of your life anymore.

31:40.700 --> 31:41.933
So if you want us
to leave you alone

31:42.000 --> 31:43.366
we'll leave you alone.

31:43.433 --> 31:44.600
All alone.

31:53.066 --> 31:54.400
Stop! Wait!

32:18.233 --> 32:21.200
'Emily, don't be scared.'

32:21.266 --> 32:22.733
'It's me Johnny.'

32:22.800 --> 32:24.133
'I'm back.'

32:36.766 --> 32:38.566
I didn't mean to scare you

32:38.633 --> 32:40.900
You didn't scare me.

32:40.966 --> 32:44.533
Look, I know
you're probably mad at me.

32:44.600 --> 32:47.000
We'll have to be quiet
or my parents will hear us

32:47.800 --> 32:49.566
And I don't blame you.

32:49.633 --> 32:51.566
I just had to get away
for a while.

32:51.633 --> 32:53.033
You could have called.

32:53.633 --> 32:54.733
Yeah, I know.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.500
But I didn't think
I needed to give you

32:57.566 --> 32:59.800
the itinerary of my whole life.

32:59.866 --> 33:01.266
Surely, one day.

33:01.333 --> 33:03.333
Johnny, why are you here?

33:03.400 --> 33:07.233
Well, I came back.
I heard about the accident.

33:08.866 --> 33:10.533
Emily, I'm really sorry.

33:12.866 --> 33:14.433
You shouldn't feel guilty.

33:19.766 --> 33:21.133
Guilty?

33:21.200 --> 33:22.800
Guilty about what?

33:24.600 --> 33:26.133
Being alive.

33:27.166 --> 33:29.166
Might as well try
to explain why

33:29.233 --> 33:32.000
one rose bud opens wide

33:32.066 --> 33:34.100
and the others just wither
on the vine.

33:36.266 --> 33:40.300
Emily...now that I'm back,
I'll try to make you happy.

33:41.366 --> 33:44.400
Try to give you everything
you really want.

33:44.466 --> 33:46.200
If you just give me
another chance.

33:47.566 --> 33:48.833
I'll be back this time.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.033
I promise.

34:17.566 --> 34:18.833
Is Emily okay?

34:18.900 --> 34:20.700
Sure, dad.

34:23.200 --> 34:24.700
Oh, she's fine.

34:25.700 --> 34:27.733
She is just fine.

34:29.633 --> 34:32.466
Emily is going to get on
with her life

34:32.533 --> 34:35.866
so that we can finally
get on with ours.

34:35.933 --> 34:38.833
I didn't mean to make
dad and you so unhappy, mom.

34:41.566 --> 34:46.433
It's just that...she misses
Annie and Starr so much.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.433
Mom?

34:48.500 --> 34:52.233
She refuses to believe
that they're really dead.

34:53.233 --> 34:55.100
Both of them, dead.

34:56.566 --> 34:58.000
It's just not fair.

34:59.733 --> 35:02.733
Annie and Starr
were her best friends.

35:05.166 --> 35:07.933
In fact..

35:08.000 --> 35:11.700
...she loved them more
than she loved her own family.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.733
'The doctor said she didn't
really wanna kill herself.'

35:15.800 --> 35:17.433
'It was just a cry for help.'

35:22.733 --> 35:24.966
I don't think that's so..

35:25.033 --> 35:27.200
I think she'd rather be dead.

35:27.266 --> 35:29.566
Dead and buried in the ground
with Annie and Starr

35:29.633 --> 35:31.233
than alive with her own family.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.533
Dad?

35:37.800 --> 35:39.000
'Emily!'

35:41.900 --> 35:45.033
Oh, Johnny! I was afraid
I'd never see you again.

35:46.300 --> 35:47.833
I told you I'd be back.

35:49.766 --> 35:51.233
I promised.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.100
You couldn't get rid of me now
if you tried.

35:58.766 --> 36:01.933
Well, don't just stand there.
Go on in and get ready.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.300
For what?

36:03.366 --> 36:05.300
We have a date.

36:05.366 --> 36:06.666
I'll be back in a while.

36:06.733 --> 36:08.733
And I really hate
to be kept waiting.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.066
I-I'll be ready.

36:10.133 --> 36:12.633
No jeans and sweatshirt.

36:12.700 --> 36:15.166
Wear something special.

36:15.233 --> 36:16.933
Where are we going?

36:19.033 --> 36:21.833
There're some things a young
girl doesn't need to know.

36:23.466 --> 36:24.900
Not until it's time.

36:37.300 --> 36:39.466
'Emily!'

36:39.533 --> 36:40.533
Come in.

36:48.400 --> 36:51.100
Oh, excuse me.
I-I must have the wrong room.

36:51.166 --> 36:53.266
- I was--
- I was looking for my daughter.

36:53.333 --> 36:55.300
I-I was just trying
on some new makeup and stuff.

36:55.366 --> 36:56.433
It'll wash off.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.966
Oh, no, no.
Don't change a thing.

36:59.033 --> 37:01.433
I-I think you look neat.

37:01.500 --> 37:04.500
Uh, cool. Funky.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.066
You look beautiful, baby.

37:13.133 --> 37:14.900
Thanks, dad.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.033
So..

37:17.900 --> 37:20.200
...all dressed up
with no place to go?

37:22.733 --> 37:26.133
Well, at least you're
getting back to your old self.

37:29.566 --> 37:34.400
Well, you know, this morning...
your mom was right.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.900
You've gotta find somethin
to live for.

37:49.866 --> 37:51.400
Goodnight, Emily.

38:16.466 --> 38:18.366
- Hello.
- 'Hello, Emily.'

38:18.433 --> 38:21.133
'It's just me,
your old friend...Annie.'

38:23.166 --> 38:24.866
'So we'll pick you up,
about 8:00?'

38:24.933 --> 38:26.533
'Come on, Emily.
It'll be fun.'

38:56.166 --> 38:59.166
- Emily!
- Annie, is that you?

38:59.233 --> 39:02.400
Oh my God, you're alive.
You're really alive.

39:02.466 --> 39:03.733
Why didn't you tell me?

39:03.800 --> 39:04.733
I guess I thought
it wouldn't make

39:04.800 --> 39:06.166
all that much difference to you.

39:06.233 --> 39:08.766
- How can you say that?
- Emily, I'm so sorry.

39:08.833 --> 39:11.500
When I heard what you did, I was
all the way to hell and back.

39:11.566 --> 39:12.900
I know you said
we'd always be friends

39:12.966 --> 39:15.766
but I guess I didn't believe
you really meant it.

39:15.833 --> 39:18.200
I was wrong. So I came
to get you, to take you back.

39:18.266 --> 39:20.933
It's absolute paradise
out there, you're gonna love it.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.400
We can get a little apartment
by the beach.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.466
Annie, I don't
wanna leave Springwood.

39:35.533 --> 39:37.333
Yeah, it's really great
out there.

39:37.400 --> 39:41.466
No hopes, no dreams.
I'm free. Really free.

39:41.533 --> 39:44.266
I've gotta get back,
because Johnny's waiting.

39:44.333 --> 39:46.500
Waiting, that's the bad part.

39:46.566 --> 39:48.466
Waiting for your friends to die.

39:48.533 --> 39:50.433
Sometimes it gets so lonely.

39:51.766 --> 39:53.166
Annie, it's locked.

39:55.933 --> 39:59.533
You can't go back, Emily.
Just like I can't go back.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.866
Crash and burn is forever.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.600
If you don't believe me,
just ask Starr.

40:11.233 --> 40:12.600
No!

40:47.033 --> 40:48.333
Oh my God, Johnny!

40:48.400 --> 40:49.833
I was supposed to die
in that car crash

40:49.900 --> 40:51.266
that night, but I didn't.

40:51.333 --> 40:54.900
And now, Starr and Annie,
they've come back to get me.

40:54.966 --> 40:56.200
No, Emily.

40:57.333 --> 40:58.800
I'm the one
who's gonna get you.

40:58.900 --> 41:00.333
No!

41:27.566 --> 41:29.300
That night at the accident..

41:29.366 --> 41:33.400
...you thought what you wanted
was to be with me.

41:33.466 --> 41:36.700
But you really
wanted to be with your friends.

41:36.766 --> 41:39.933
I said I'd try to make you happy
if you gave me another chance.

41:41.200 --> 41:44.000
Well, I'm not gonna
let you down this time.

41:44.066 --> 41:46.100
I'm not gonna run off

41:46.166 --> 41:48.333
and leave you alone.

41:48.400 --> 41:53.033
This time, I'm gonna give you
what you really want.

41:54.966 --> 41:57.600
Whoooo!

41:59.266 --> 42:03.566
If it wasn't for that
little ID tag on your toe

42:03.633 --> 42:07.500
I wouldn't even recognize
my little pretty Emily.

42:15.766 --> 42:18.600
Sun tan beige, number three.

42:21.300 --> 42:24.333
And a little blush...
for that healthy look.

42:26.333 --> 42:28.533
Oh, God!

42:28.600 --> 42:30.200
You're size 6, right?

42:36.500 --> 42:37.900
Simple.

42:39.800 --> 42:40.966
Classic.

42:41.033 --> 42:44.166
Something you can wear
through eternity.

42:46.400 --> 42:47.933
God!

42:50.533 --> 42:53.166
You look even more beautiful..

42:53.233 --> 42:55.833
...than Annie and Starr
did at their funerals.

43:11.366 --> 43:13.533
Hey, mom and dad.

43:17.033 --> 43:19.400
Take a look
at your little girl.

43:26.666 --> 43:28.300
She looks beautiful.

43:29.066 --> 43:31.700
And so alive.

43:31.766 --> 43:33.866
You'd think
she could hear us.

43:33.933 --> 43:34.866
I can hear you.

43:34.933 --> 43:36.100
I can hear you.

43:36.166 --> 43:38.333
Mom, dad, I'm not dead.

43:38.400 --> 43:39.333
I'm not dead.

43:39.400 --> 43:40.700
I'm not dead.

43:40.766 --> 43:42.600
I wanna tell them
that I love them.

43:44.433 --> 43:45.900
Or at least say goodbye.

43:45.966 --> 43:47.200
Goodbye.

43:49.066 --> 43:51.333
They can't hear you.

43:51.400 --> 43:53.233
'They never listened to you'

43:53.300 --> 43:56.333
when you told them
what you wanted.

43:56.400 --> 43:59.600
You...you wrote it all down

43:59.666 --> 44:02.166
in this little diary of yours.

44:02.233 --> 44:04.400
Everything you really wanted.

44:06.466 --> 44:10.533
"I wish I had died
along with my friends."

44:11.666 --> 44:14.100
But you weren't with them,
that night.

44:14.166 --> 44:16.300
- You let them go off alone.
- I didn't know.

44:16.366 --> 44:19.133
You sent them to their deaths
without even warning them.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.433
Without even saying goodbye.

44:20.500 --> 44:22.833
It was an accident.
It wasn't my fault.

44:25.366 --> 44:28.300
No, I don't wanna die.
Please, I wanna live.

44:50.833 --> 44:55.033
Some books,
you just can't put down.

44:57.266 --> 44:59.600
'Cause they never end.
