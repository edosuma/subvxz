03:06.687 --> 03:07.812
Hi.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.426
- Good morning.
- Hello, I'm Carla Norris.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.136
I have an appointment
with Mrs. McEvoy.

03:40.303 --> 03:43.097
Through the garden, please.
I'll tell her you're on your way there.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.306
Thanks.

03:44.516 --> 03:48.018
Hello, Mrs. McEvoy?
Your 8:00 is here.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.348
- Good morning.
- Miss Norris?

04:26.558 --> 04:27.641
Yes.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.770
- Hello, I'm Evelyn McEvoy.
- Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.606
This midtown traffic.
I'll never get used to it.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.232
Shall we see the apartment?

04:37.360 --> 04:38.736
Yes. Sure.

04:45.577 --> 04:50.331
Central air conditioning.
Absolutely terrific kitchen.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.586
- I love the view.
- Yes. It's an airy place.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.275
What is it that you do, Miss Norris?

05:19.027 --> 05:20.903
I'm a book editor at Sutton.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.951
- What a strange tub.
- I like tubs myself.

05:29.704 --> 05:33.415
This is a nice room for reading, isn't it?

05:34.209 --> 05:35.918
- For reading?
- Hmm.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.128
Yes, it is, isn't it?

05:44.302 --> 05:46.428
l've got two tickets for Pavarotti Friday.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.597
I hate Pavarotti.

05:49.307 --> 05:54.228
I don't care if l ever go to an opera
for the rest of my life. Or the ballet.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.690
What do you want me to do?
Meet another charming man...

05:57.899 --> 06:00.276
...like Derek,
and wake up seven years later...

06:00.485 --> 06:03.028
- ...and realize I have no life?
- God, Carly, please.

06:03.488 --> 06:06.490
- Look, why don't you get tickets to....
- Who?

06:07.868 --> 06:10.077
- Pearl Jam.
- Pearl Jam?

06:10.287 --> 06:11.328
Yeah.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.414
You know, you're being a putz.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.417
How am I going to meet any attractive men
by myself?

06:16.626 --> 06:18.127
You love Pavarotti.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.839
I am a putz.
I wasted seven years of my life.

06:22.674 --> 06:26.176
- And I hate Pavarotti.
- Will you stop it?

06:26.386 --> 06:30.681
You are ready for new adventures.
New horizons. New lovers. New orgasms.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.059
- Well?
- Heh, I'm 35, I’m not 25.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.479
I don't need a date,
I need a relationship.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.024
Preferably one
where something happens this time.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.192
Sure, in case you've forgotten
how it works...

06:42.402 --> 06:44.612
...first you meet somebody,
then you have a relationship.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.280
Ooh, thank you, Dr. Ruth.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.825
Do you work here, or do you go
from office to office, offering advice?

06:50.076 --> 06:52.953
Will you look at chapter six?
I think I might have cut too deep.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.248
- You didn't show it to the author yet, did you?
- Yeah, l did.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.334
And?

06:58.710 --> 07:00.753
He said, "I'll discuss it with Carly."

07:00.962 --> 07:02.713
Heh, you cut too deep.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.466
Never show it to the author
before you give it to me first.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.551
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.386
I'm sure the cuts are good.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.514
The author's a pussycat,
don't worry about it. This is good.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.976
Where are you with the James Dean bio?
Marketing wants to up the publishing date.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.146
- I'll be done by the end of the weekend.
- You're a genius, Carly.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.649
Sure, who wouldn't be
on your social schedule?

07:21.858 --> 07:24.360
Mrs. McEvoy on Line one.
She says it's important.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.445
- Do you want to talk to her?
- Yeah.

07:26.655 --> 07:30.616
And Mr. Parsons called. He wants
to take you to lunch at L'Adagio.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.535
That means I'm not getting my raise.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.372
Mrs. McEvoy.

07:36.581 --> 07:37.623
Good news, my dear.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.084
- Your application's been approved.
- Already?

07:40.752 --> 07:43.462
- ls that a problem?
- No.

07:44.255 --> 07:47.925
No, I.... I just didn't think
it would happen this fast.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.678
Oh, I thought you'd be pleased.

07:51.554 --> 07:55.516
I am. I'm very excited. Thank you.

07:55.684 --> 07:58.852
Well, then, we can get you in next week.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.689
- Next week will be fine.
- Splendid.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.650
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.847
- There you go.
- Thank you.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.140
Sure.

08:37.642 --> 08:40.727
Sorry I couldn’t get the door
for you, Miss Norris.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.980
The movers will be here
in about an hour.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.442
- I'll keep an eye out for you.
- Thank you.

08:48.278 --> 08:52.531
He didn't want a "thank you."
I think he wanted a tip.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.452
Well, he didn't get the door for me,
now, did he?

08:56.995 --> 08:58.454
Sure he didn't.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.914
- Can I take one of these for you?
- I'm okay.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.542
Come on, I've got two free arms.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.670
You want me to take this other one for you?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.839
- No, I'm okay.
- You're sure?

09:09.466 --> 09:11.008
Okay.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.014
I, uh, know the neighborhood
real well, so...

09:17.223 --> 09:19.975
...if you want the lowdown
on stores and things like that.

09:20.185 --> 09:23.312
- I could....
- How's the market across the street?

09:23.521 --> 09:26.273
It's okay.
The one over on 39th is cheaper.

09:26.483 --> 09:27.524
Oh, heh, thanks.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.985
I'm not gonna ask again
if l can bring this for you.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.697
- Good. Don't.
- Here you go.

09:35.617 --> 09:36.992
Thank you.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.870
Welcome to 113. You'll like it here.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.039
I will. Thank you.

09:46.544 --> 09:49.296
You're right. These are getting heavy.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.591
- Sorry. I’ll see you.
- Bye.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.596
I need a check, okay, Register 3.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.850
Check, okay, on Register 3, please.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.448
You only have one thing.
Why don't you go ahead?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.575
Oh, good idea. Thanks.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.162
Um, I’m Gus Hale.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.915
- You're moving in today, aren't you?
- Mm-hm.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.709
- Well, welcome to 113.
- Thanks.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.713
Um, I’m in 23-B.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.470
- I'll take that for you.
- Thank you.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.431
Hey, why are you walking here?

10:46.604 --> 10:49.731
Forgive me,
I don't usually follow women around.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.192
I'm not a dirty old man, really not.

10:52.402 --> 10:57.114
- Are you certain?
- Sometimes I wish I were, but I'm not.

10:57.282 --> 11:00.868
- Why do you wish you were?
- Because it's boring when you're not.

11:01.077 --> 11:05.455
You just really....
Well, you look like someone.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.500
Someone you like
or someone you dislike?

11:08.710 --> 11:10.627
Oh, no. l liked her a lot.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.963
What's really strange is...

11:13.506 --> 11:15.549
...she was in 20-B as well.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.801
Naomi Singer.

11:17.969 --> 11:22.222
- When did she move?
- Well, she didn't. She....

11:22.390 --> 11:25.559
She jumped out the window.

11:27.187 --> 11:32.482
Uh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, ugh....
I've never had much goddamned tact.

11:32.984 --> 11:36.862
Ugh, I tell you what.
I'm about to go off to Japan.

11:37.238 --> 11:40.115
Perhaps when I get back,
I can fill you in on all the gossip.

11:40.325 --> 11:43.202
- What are you gonna do there?
- I teach a class at NYU.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.121
The Psychology of the Lens.

11:46.581 --> 11:49.625
- "The Psychology of the Lens," heh-heh-heh.
- Yes.

11:49.959 --> 11:53.253
I teach all aspects.
I mean, cameras, camcorders....

11:53.463 --> 11:55.631
I'm going
to look at the latest technology.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.636
So you like salacious gossip?

12:01.262 --> 12:03.680
I make a great cappuccino too.

12:04.015 --> 12:05.140
Call me.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.435
How can I call you
when I don't even know your name?

12:08.686 --> 12:11.772
How can you not know my name
if you knew my apartment number?

12:11.981 --> 12:17.152
Our doormen are spoiled.
Five bucks only gets you half the information.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.822
- Carly Norris.
- Ah.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.867
Must have liked her an awful lot
to spend five bucks.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.369
I did.

12:25.536 --> 12:29.623
We were pals.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.994
How's the market across the street?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.329
It's okay.

14:41.756 --> 14:44.841
Welcome to 113. You'll like it here.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.101
- Where do you live now?
- ln the village.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.605
This will be quite a change.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.317
Shall l show you the rest of the apartment?

16:25.526 --> 16:27.736
Have you grown tired of the village?

16:28.279 --> 16:31.448
Oh, I teach all aspects of it.
Cameras, camcorders....

16:56.682 --> 16:57.933
This way.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.477
Now, why don't you talk
to Lynn Nesbit about him?

17:00.686 --> 17:04.606
His last book didn't sell very well.
Perhaps he's getting itchy at Random.

17:04.815 --> 17:08.568
Perhaps he's blaming their marketing
and not the thinness of his characters.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.946
Perhaps you can convince Lynn
to alert him to the inadequacies...

17:12.156 --> 17:14.699
- ...of their marketing department.
- Are we negotiating?

17:14.909 --> 17:16.242
I wouldn't call it that.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.082
Attractive man, isn't he?

17:22.415 --> 17:27.712
Alex, I ask you for a raise,
you take me out to lunch and try to set me up.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.673
Jack Landsford.

17:29.882 --> 17:33.093
Shred of Evidence, Flesh and Blood,
police procedurals.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.595
He hasn't written anything
in five or six years...

17:35.805 --> 17:38.598
...but he made so much off of
Flesh and Blood, he doesn't have to.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.600
He's got a ranch in Montana.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.520
- And speak of the devil,
- Hello, Alex.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.689
- How are you?
- All right, heh.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.440
I'm the devil.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.194
- Carla Norris.
- Hello.

17:52.697 --> 17:53.905
You look familiar to me.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.284
Maybe that's because
I live in your building.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.287
- Oh, yeah.
- Heh.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.664
- Jack, Carly is a big fan of yours.
- Mm.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.791
She just loved Flesh and Blood.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.127
- Hey.
- I haven't read it.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.462
I'm sorry.

18:10.131 --> 18:12.173
- Here you are.
- She hasn't read me.

18:13.551 --> 18:16.511
Alex, why is it she hasn't read me?

18:16.721 --> 18:19.848
Everybody's read me, heh.
I'm easy to read.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.976
- I haven't.
- She has better taste than I thought.

18:26.564 --> 18:27.647
She’ll read me, though.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.275
What if she doesn't like
what she reads?

18:30.610 --> 18:31.860
- Hi, Jack.
- You’ll read me.

18:35.281 --> 18:39.117
I know you'll read me.
Because you have good taste.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.247
You've lost her now, Jack.
She likes being in control.

18:45.750 --> 18:46.875
So do l.

18:48.419 --> 18:51.129
- See you around the neighborhood.
- Yeah.

18:53.591 --> 18:54.758
Alex.

18:58.679 --> 19:02.182
I spend seven years in a bad marriage,
and you say I like being in control?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.267
But you ended it, didn't you?

19:12.693 --> 19:15.862
No. No way.

19:16.614 --> 19:17.697
No.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.701
Fuck both of you. You said 700, Mike.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.538
Yeah, l know it's not fucking Vogue.
So what?

19:26.624 --> 19:28.583
Well, it's your choice.

19:28.793 --> 19:34.297
Look, I’m hungry, I'm jet-lagged, and
I don't need this shit. Goodbye, Michael.

19:34.465 --> 19:37.717
God, I'm sorry. I’m gonna get those
right out of your way.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.177
- That's okay.
- I'm Vida.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.428
- Carly Norris.
- Hi.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.138
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks.

19:43.224 --> 19:46.393
Damn doormen.
I really tip them well too.

19:46.727 --> 19:47.977
Everybody does.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.146
They're never around
when you need them.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.982
You're right.
You should see them at Christmas.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.901
Like flies on shit then.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.614
Oh, yeah, this guy was here.

19:59.824 --> 20:04.661
He left this for you.

20:11.585 --> 20:15.088
- You're all moved in, then?
- Oh, God, no. l hate it.

20:15.297 --> 20:18.174
I know. It's worse than anal intercourse.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.553
- You look like--
- Yeah, the girl that....

20:21.762 --> 20:22.804
- Naomi.
- Yeah.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.515
Somebody's already told you.
I guess they would have.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.143
- Were you friends?
- Well, sort of.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.603
I mean, she was only here about a year.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.856
And most of that time, I was in Milan.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.691
Ass-pinching Italians.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.026
- Ugh.
- My bum is still blue.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.195
I couldn't believe it, though.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.365
I mean,
she just didn't seem like the type.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.492
- Were you here when she--
- Yeah.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.370
She came over
to borrow some coffee the night before.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.373
- I didn't have any.
- Caffeine withdrawal.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.875
That would do it to me.

20:53.836 --> 20:57.130
That's my agent. He's a slimy bastard.

21:01.552 --> 21:04.137
Just a goddamned second,
all right, Michael?

21:05.014 --> 21:06.473
Hey. Thanks.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.308
Right. So see you around.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.811
If you ever need any coffee
or anything....

21:11.979 --> 21:14.481
Just make sure you don't run out.

21:15.983 --> 21:19.319
Mr. Brown. That's original.
And where's he staying?

21:20.529 --> 21:22.906
The Regency Arms?

21:23.073 --> 21:24.657
Okay.

21:25.493 --> 21:28.703
And, uh, what's his room number?

21:30.372 --> 21:34.542
627, got it.

21:35.169 --> 21:38.046
Yeah, well, they all say
they're producers or sheikhs.

21:38.255 --> 21:41.841
Hi, putz.
I’m giving you your last chance for Pavarotti.

21:42.092 --> 21:45.512
Hey, isn't Pearl Jam
some sort of oriental sex thing?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.514
Yummy.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.269
Carla, this is Zeke Hawkins calling.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.688
I, uh, hope you remember me.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.315
l live in the building too.

21:57.525 --> 21:59.818
We met when you were
moving in last weekend?

22:00.027 --> 22:03.154
Anyway, listen, um, l was just calling
to let you know that if you...

22:03.364 --> 22:06.866
...need any help with anything,
l've got some pull with the manager, so...

22:07.076 --> 22:08.785
...don't be afraid to give me a call.

22:08.994 --> 22:13.540
I’m at home most of the day.
My number's 5553126.

22:13.707 --> 22:16.543
All righty? Okay, bye.

22:16.710 --> 22:17.836
Hi, it's Peter.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.129
We are moving up the pub date
on the Dean book.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.132
Just thought I’d call
and let you know. Bye.

23:07.595 --> 23:10.972
Yeah, but what about
the appointment with Sony in Osaka?

23:11.181 --> 23:13.308
Seven thirty on Monday?

23:13.934 --> 23:16.728
Oh, well. I'll do it any time they will.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.355
I mean, I have to see them.
They're state-of-the-art.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.858
...defensive system
is extraordinarily developed.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.943
Acute schizophrenic, non-paranoid.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.029
Classic Jekyll-and-Hyde syndrome.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.032
Clearly a great danger to women.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.035
No, no, no. It's so good to hear your voice.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.789
We could rent one.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.499
Well, that's an idea.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.627
Hi, Zeke. It's Carla Norris.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.963
Thanks for your call. l, uh, heh....

23:44.131 --> 23:46.841
lf l ever get unpacked around here...

23:47.051 --> 23:52.388
...l was thinking of having, um,
a cocktail party on Friday night.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.642
Um, sometime after 6:00 o’clock.

23:55.809 --> 23:59.187
And I was wondering
if you'd like to come.

23:59.396 --> 24:03.566
Okay, I hope that you do. Bye-bye.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.118
Brother.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.731
- You think that was funny?
- Yeah.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.567
I didn't think that was funny.
You scared the shit out of me.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.027
Yeah, yeah, I know. I know.

25:30.487 --> 25:33.239
Ah, I'm sorry.
You're right, it wasn't funny. l....

25:33.449 --> 25:36.325
It was a real dumb-ass thing to do.
Really, I'm sorry.

25:37.828 --> 25:40.079
Can we start over again, huh?

25:40.289 --> 25:45.293
Heh, what for? I really don't see the point.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.545
- Hey, did you get the books?
- Yeah.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.464
- Did you read them?
- No.

25:49.673 --> 25:52.300
Oh, yeah, you did. You can't fool me.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.177
I read a few pages of one of them.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.013
Uh-huh. You read both.
You couldn’t put them down.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.973
I'm right, aren't I? Tell me I am right.

25:59.183 --> 26:00.224
You're wrong.

26:00.809 --> 26:01.893
What?

26:02.102 --> 26:04.687
You don't like sex and violence?
It sells, you know.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.190
It buys ranches in Montana, I'm told.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.860
Oh-ho-ho-ho. You've been checking on me.
I like that.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.155
- Thank you.
- For what?

26:14.364 --> 26:16.074
For stopping.

26:16.241 --> 26:20.578
Now, how about gossip?
About James Dean, for instance.

26:20.788 --> 26:22.747
Doesn't that sell?

26:22.915 --> 26:24.999
You've been checking on me.
I don't like that.

26:25.209 --> 26:28.503
I hear you're, uh, very good at the tell-alls.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.756
I guess that comes
from being married to a very boring guy.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.674
You just like all the juicy talk.

26:33.884 --> 26:36.511
- Fuck you.
- Would you like to?

26:36.678 --> 26:39.597
I can try and make myself available.
Hey, look....

26:39.807 --> 26:41.808
I'm a writer. People tell me secrets...

26:42.017 --> 26:44.769
...and I just take notes.
Like Truman Capote.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.939
- You could tell me your secrets.
- I don't have any secrets.

26:49.858 --> 26:50.942
Sure you do.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.028
What secrets do I have?

26:56.740 --> 26:57.949
I'd never tell.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.539
Did you send me the telescope?

27:07.209 --> 27:09.877
- Telescope?
- Yeah.

27:10.087 --> 27:12.547
Why would I send you a telescope?

27:12.714 --> 27:13.714
Hey.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.679
I can't keep up with you.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.973
No, you can't.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.478
Taxi.

27:46.582 --> 27:49.792
Excuse me, officers, let her through,
please. She lives here. Come on.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.003
Come on, Miss Norris. Come on.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.088
- Do you live here?
- Did you know Mr. Hale?

27:54.256 --> 27:58.176
- How long have you lived here?
- How do you feel about these accidents?

28:02.264 --> 28:05.183
- Yes, he was a lecturer at NYU.
- Mm-hm.

28:05.392 --> 28:08.853
He doesn't seem to have had any family.
That's about all I know.

28:13.442 --> 28:16.277
Miss? Miss?

28:18.530 --> 28:23.993
- Are you a resident here?
- Yeah. Carla Norris.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.828
- Uh-huh.
- 20-B.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.788
20-B?

28:28.540 --> 28:31.250
- What happened?
- The guy in 23-B...

28:31.460 --> 28:33.461
...the, uh, professor, Gus Hale...

28:33.670 --> 28:35.546
...he fell in the shower
and broke his neck.

28:37.633 --> 28:38.841
Did you know Mr. Hale?

28:39.468 --> 28:42.970
- I talked to him.
- What about?

28:43.805 --> 28:48.142
Well, uh, not that much, really.
We talked about, uh...

28:49.353 --> 28:51.938
...that he was going to Japan.

28:52.272 --> 28:56.400
- We talked about Naomi Singer.
- What did he say about Naomi Singer?

28:56.944 --> 29:00.446
That they were friends, and, uh...

29:00.614 --> 29:02.240
...that I look like her.

29:02.699 --> 29:03.866
You do.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.964
I don't remember giving you an invitation.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.800
I have a nose
for smelling parties in progress.

30:45.010 --> 30:48.346
- Also, a bottle of Dom Perignon.
- Hmm.

30:48.555 --> 30:51.140
Come on in, honey. I like you already.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.642
- You hold and I’ll pop.
- Yeah.

30:54.269 --> 30:57.271
Jack Landsford,
I'd like to introduce you...

30:57.981 --> 30:59.774
- ...to Judy, of course.
- Oh, heh.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.150
Hi. Remember me?

31:01.360 --> 31:02.401
- We met in the doorway?
- Hmm.

31:02.611 --> 31:03.986
- And Peter.
- Hi. How are you?

31:04.196 --> 31:06.655
- Pete. Hey, Alex.
- Jack, how are you?

31:06.865 --> 31:09.408
- Good. How you been?
- And you know Vida.

31:09.659 --> 31:12.703
- Hi, I'm Vida Warren.
- Hello. Jack Landsford.

31:12.913 --> 31:15.498
I'm sorry.
I thought you two knew each other.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.333
Say "cheese."

31:18.210 --> 31:19.418
Oh.

31:19.628 --> 31:20.878
- Jesus.
- Heh.

31:23.465 --> 31:26.592
- Oh, hey.
- Hello. Here you go.

31:27.344 --> 31:30.012
- Is this Dom Perignon too?
- California red.

31:31.181 --> 31:33.015
I'm sorry.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.726
Now, this is very interesting.

31:36.019 --> 31:39.355
It looks like Lalique, but it's not.
It's a copy.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.357
You're right about that, Alex.

31:41.525 --> 31:45.027
Nothing in the haunted house
is what it appears to be.

31:45.195 --> 31:47.279
They've remodeled it completely.

31:47.489 --> 31:48.781
Who owns it?

31:48.949 --> 31:51.325
I heard it was, uh,
some law firm downtown.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.286
No. That's a false front.
I checked on that once.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.372
I bet l could find out who owns it.

31:56.540 --> 31:57.957
I know some people.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.959
I could make a few calls if you really want to know.

32:00.127 --> 32:01.335
Pete, don't.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.713
It could be the mob.
We could be supporting crack dealers.

32:04.881 --> 32:08.050
Then what are we gonna do? Move out?

32:10.387 --> 32:11.637
There's an idea.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.726
Thank you.

32:17.894 --> 32:19.728
- It's a great party.
- Oh, thank you.

32:19.896 --> 32:23.399
Hey there. Can I get you something?

32:24.359 --> 32:26.444
I'm fine, thanks.

32:26.987 --> 32:31.240
- So how do you like the new place?
- Oh, yeah.

32:31.825 --> 32:33.784
Did you know Naomi Singer?

32:34.786 --> 32:37.371
Not really. I saw her around a few times.

32:37.581 --> 32:39.415
I wonder why she did it.

32:40.667 --> 32:44.462
Yeah. l don't know, l think I read
something about boyfriend troubles.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.798
Oh, they're doing it.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.217
Oh, they are. I can't believe it.

32:50.427 --> 32:52.761
Something exciting happening?

32:53.013 --> 32:55.973
I don't believe it. They are, oh.

32:56.183 --> 32:58.726
Let me see. Let me see.

33:01.563 --> 33:04.064
Oh, they sure are.

33:07.694 --> 33:11.238
Would you look at her?
She's a voyeur. She can't get enough.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.241
- I am not.
- Yes, you are.

33:14.451 --> 33:16.285
That's why you have this telescope here.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.537
- It's not even mine.
- You're a peeper.

33:18.747 --> 33:21.665
Somebody gave this to me.

33:21.875 --> 33:24.793
- Right.
- Everybody has a telescope.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.921
- I don't.
- I do.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.425
- Thank you.
- I do too.

33:31.676 --> 33:34.553
I'm shocked. I'm truly shocked.
You people are shameless.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.973
You're all shameless.
What is with you guys?

33:38.183 --> 33:39.517
- Look at that.
- Come on.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.352
- Hurry up.
- Just a moment.

33:41.561 --> 33:42.645
I wanna look too.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.313
Oh, my God.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.525
It looks like they're being Rolfed.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.986
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.988
- Thank you for coming.
- Thanks. Bye.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.657
- Good night.
- Bye.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.663
Good night. And thanks for the wine.

34:01.957 --> 34:05.209
- Sorry about the California Red.
- I like California Red.

34:05.418 --> 34:06.961
- Good night.
- Good night.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.841
Listen, do you work out?

34:14.094 --> 34:16.136
You mean like exercise bikes and stuff?

34:16.346 --> 34:18.806
No, no. The real thing. Weights.

34:18.974 --> 34:22.476
- You want to check it out?
- Oh. No, thank you.

34:22.686 --> 34:24.895
You would have a great time.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.565
What do you think?
Tomorrow morning?

34:27.732 --> 34:30.568
You know, there are mirrors
all over those places.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.902
There are no mirrors.

34:33.112 --> 34:35.447
They're everywhere you look.

34:35.657 --> 34:38.784
No mirrors. Promise.

34:39.452 --> 34:42.538
What do you say? 10:00 o'clock? I’ll call you?

34:44.081 --> 34:45.623
I'll call you. Bye.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.626
That was a great party.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.422
I thank you.

34:52.674 --> 34:53.966
You're welcome.

34:54.884 --> 34:57.469
Who knows, maybe next time
I'll get an invitation, huh?

34:58.054 --> 35:00.764
- Heh, maybe.
- Oh, you got to be careful.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.684
Maybe means "yes"
to an old ex-journalist like myself.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.521
The operative word being "ex."

35:07.814 --> 35:08.981
Yeah.

35:09.190 --> 35:11.734
But investigative reporters
never lose the instinct...

35:11.943 --> 35:13.277
...to jump in at an opening.

35:13.486 --> 35:17.031
That would explain you jumping out
at me in the park, then, I guess.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.658
Uh, no, ha.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.786
That was a tactic I developed
in junior high to get the babes.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.749
It didn't work then, either.

35:31.004 --> 35:33.047
You don't go out much, do you?

35:33.256 --> 35:34.673
I thought...

35:34.924 --> 35:38.260
...maybe in lieu of the gym...

35:39.012 --> 35:41.513
...you might want to go to dinner with me.

35:42.599 --> 35:43.641
Maybe.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.560
I'll take that maybe as a yes.

35:48.688 --> 35:51.482
- Good night, Carla.
- Good night, Jack.

36:23.306 --> 36:27.142
Mild temperatures
should climb to about 69 degrees.

36:27.352 --> 36:30.104
Humidity levels slipping to about 15 percent.

36:30.313 --> 36:33.524
Clouds and rain to return
with possible showers on Monday.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.819
Temperatures for that period
should span the 60s and 70s.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.196
Now, here's the traveler's advisory...

36:39.406 --> 36:41.156
...with a look at temperatures...

36:41.366 --> 36:43.283
...for selected cities across the nation.

36:43.493 --> 36:47.079
Remember, weather on the One every
10 minutes, here on New York One.

37:15.567 --> 37:16.984
Hello?

37:19.320 --> 37:21.613
Is somebody out there?

37:49.184 --> 37:51.435
What's the matter? Jesus.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.646
- You okay, Miss Norris?
- Yes.

37:54.814 --> 37:55.981
I hear something in my office.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.152
- What the hell happened?
- I was, uh....

38:00.320 --> 38:02.905
The lights went out, and, uh...

38:03.072 --> 38:06.617
...the door was jammed,
and then I heard this sound. I just....

38:16.461 --> 38:18.504
Look, it must have jammed.

38:18.713 --> 38:23.425
Ugh, come on. I think all this
haunted house crap is getting to you.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.810
I don't believe it. You're such a liar.

38:32.977 --> 38:36.480
Looks like they must
have put up a few mirrors in here, huh?

38:36.689 --> 38:38.023
Yeah, overnight, right?

38:38.942 --> 38:40.567
Come on.
The locker room's right here.

38:43.446 --> 38:46.031
You conned me into this.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.367
It'll be fun. Trust me.

39:18.898 --> 39:22.943
Okay. Your turn.

39:23.653 --> 39:25.904
- I can't do that.
- Oh, yes, you can.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.992
Come on. I'll teach you.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.330
Okay, heh.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.425
Great. Great.

39:47.135 --> 39:49.469
Just keep your hips straight.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.558
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a very nice butt?

39:56.477 --> 39:59.897
- I already know you're a liar.
- You do.

40:01.482 --> 40:03.483
Nobody's told me that in a long time.

40:04.736 --> 40:08.155
That's because the wrong people
have been looking at it.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.908
That's true.

40:21.294 --> 40:25.213
- How often do you work out?
- Three, four times a week.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.673
Hmm.

40:26.883 --> 40:30.052
I'm starving. How about you?

40:30.219 --> 40:31.887
Yeah.

40:32.347 --> 40:34.431
How do you find the time?

40:35.934 --> 40:38.393
- I work at home.
- Argh, heh.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.228
I design computer video games.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.189
Oh, yeah?

40:44.233 --> 40:46.485
You think I'm too young for you,
don't you?

40:46.653 --> 40:47.778
What?

40:47.987 --> 40:50.614
- You do, don't you?
- No.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.991
- I wasn't thinking about that.
- Liar.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.160
Yes, you were.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.454
I'm not.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.898
You like it?

41:25.191 --> 41:30.320
Yeah. l love it. I play it all the time.

41:32.699 --> 41:37.703
- So you really do have the beer.
- I told you it wasn't a ruse.

41:40.123 --> 41:41.748
Thank you.

41:45.920 --> 41:49.715
- What's that?
- A volcano.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.926
I've always loved them.

41:54.178 --> 41:56.888
I'd like to fly into one sometime.

41:58.725 --> 42:00.267
Why?

42:01.477 --> 42:03.937
I don't know. It sounds like fun.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.858
Don't you think?

42:09.610 --> 42:11.486
I have to go.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.534
- Please, I....
- It's okay.

42:22.081 --> 42:24.583
You're so beautiful, Carly.

42:39.015 --> 42:40.640
They’ll see.

42:44.479 --> 42:46.563
I want to see.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.817
I want to see you.

44:47.143 --> 44:48.810
It's okay.

44:49.562 --> 44:52.480
It's okay. I'm here.

46:06.472 --> 46:08.348
What are you worried about?

46:09.100 --> 46:12.227
Somebody's watching you
like you watch them?

46:13.813 --> 46:16.481
Why don't you come over here
with me and lie down?

46:17.650 --> 46:21.403
Why? So you can talk dirty to me
some more?

46:29.078 --> 46:30.412
Please?

47:53.037 --> 47:55.789
Oh, I have to go.

47:58.209 --> 48:01.836
It's my building, Carly. I own it.

48:05.049 --> 48:07.342
I even helped redesign it.

48:10.054 --> 48:12.597
My father owned
a bunch of hotels, so I...

48:13.849 --> 48:15.975
...I inherited a lot of money.

48:16.519 --> 48:21.064
I didn't want to be bothered with a lot
of hassles, so I don't tell people that l own it.

48:21.941 --> 48:25.235
Did you tell Mrs. McEvoy
to give me special treatment?

48:25.403 --> 48:26.694
No.

48:26.862 --> 48:29.406
But I did approve
your application quickly.

48:31.117 --> 48:33.743
You had me all plotted out, huh?

48:39.500 --> 48:41.334
I just thought we would like each other.

48:42.586 --> 48:44.421
You're not angry with me, are you?

49:08.529 --> 49:10.780
Boy, have I got something to tell you.

49:10.990 --> 49:13.450
You're not going to believe it!

49:13.617 --> 49:16.286
This is Judy. Will you call me?

49:16.454 --> 49:19.747
Where have you been?
I've been trying to call you all day.

49:19.915 --> 49:22.959
Huh. Something's going on, I can smell it.

49:23.169 --> 49:25.378
You've probably been having
multiple orgasms.

49:26.088 --> 49:29.007
You've probably been
fucking your brains out.

49:30.593 --> 49:32.427
l have.

49:32.928 --> 49:35.680
Carly, Alex is all over me about the Dean book.

49:35.848 --> 49:40.226
Please, please, work on it
this weekend. Bye.

50:09.423 --> 50:10.632
Good night.

50:10.841 --> 50:13.593
Sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite.

50:18.933 --> 50:21.976
You do look like you fucked
your brains out. Look at you.

50:22.186 --> 50:24.270
What are you smiling at?
That damn éclair?

50:24.480 --> 50:27.190
- I'm just smiling. That's all.
- Tell me.

50:27.399 --> 50:30.276
I want to know everything.
Every little grunt. Every wiggle.

50:30.486 --> 50:32.779
There's nothing to tell.

50:33.531 --> 50:35.823
You've been spending too much time
with your vibrator.

50:36.033 --> 50:39.202
I certainly have.
I'm getting a plastic yeast infection.

50:39.411 --> 50:41.496
- Heh.
- Who is he? Do I know him? Tell me.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.122
- Tell me.
- You met him.

50:43.332 --> 50:44.332
- I met him?
- Uh-huh.

50:44.500 --> 50:46.543
I didn't pin him to the wall
and ravish him myself?

50:46.710 --> 50:47.961
And you got him?
Now I’m pissed.

50:48.170 --> 50:49.587
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Who?

50:49.797 --> 50:51.839
It's Zeke. You met him at my apartment.

50:52.091 --> 50:56.010
That gorgeous, young, incredible....
Oh, my God, I hate you.

50:56.303 --> 50:58.513
I really hate you. How is he?

50:58.722 --> 51:02.392
Give me the goods. Is he insatiable?
I bet he's insatiable, heh.

51:02.601 --> 51:05.061
They all are at that age.
Lead pencils.

51:05.271 --> 51:07.981
I hate you. I really, really hate you.

51:08.190 --> 51:12.694
I go away with the other one for what
I think is going to be a hot steamy weekend...

51:12.903 --> 51:15.029
...and you're reloading a lead pencil.

51:15.239 --> 51:17.657
I must have done something terrible
in my past life.

51:17.866 --> 51:20.827
- Wait. You went off with who?
- Jack Landsford.

51:21.620 --> 51:24.622
Huh, who's not even a sharpened pencil,
let me tell you.

51:24.832 --> 51:28.626
- We went to Montauk. Stayed in a cabin.
- Heh-heh-heh.

51:28.794 --> 51:33.923
- What happened?
- Nothing. Not a damn thing.

51:34.091 --> 51:36.759
- The earth definitely did not move.
- Heh.

51:36.927 --> 51:41.931
All he did was ask about you.
You know, you should go out with him.

51:42.099 --> 51:44.976
Just to find out for me
if he's even got a pencil.

53:01.637 --> 53:03.388
I'll bet it's something blue.

53:04.515 --> 53:06.349
Something intimate.

53:06.600 --> 53:08.059
Something lacy.

53:09.061 --> 53:10.353
Something whorish.

53:10.562 --> 53:11.979
How did you get in here?

53:13.774 --> 53:14.899
The door was open.

53:15.109 --> 53:18.528
I've lived in New York for 10 years
and I've never left my door open.

53:18.737 --> 53:21.280
Well, maybe you did this time.

53:22.741 --> 53:25.785
- Maybe the super did.
- I don't think so. I want you to leave.

53:27.496 --> 53:30.873
He was having an affair
with Naomi Singer.

53:34.795 --> 53:36.796
Maybe she smelled like flowers too.

53:37.005 --> 53:39.048
Maybe you two
use the same spermicide.

53:39.216 --> 53:41.592
- I'm calling--
- She was seeing a shrink.

53:42.553 --> 53:45.430
She told the shrink about your boyfriend.

53:45.723 --> 53:48.891
And after Naomi was murdered,
the shrink told the police.

53:49.059 --> 53:50.893
He's not my boyfriend.

53:51.103 --> 53:54.021
Oh? Well, what the hell is he, then?

53:54.231 --> 53:57.817
The neighborhood florist?
I saw you two in the lobby together.

53:57.985 --> 53:59.944
I'm not blind.

54:02.030 --> 54:05.074
My God, you really do look like her.

54:08.662 --> 54:10.621
She died right here.

54:13.959 --> 54:16.127
She went off that balcony.

54:18.005 --> 54:20.840
You don't know
what you're dealing with, do you?

54:21.341 --> 54:23.259
He's fucked up.

54:25.387 --> 54:28.306
He's so very, very sick.

54:30.851 --> 54:32.894
You don't believe me, do you?

54:34.188 --> 54:37.732
All right. Here.

54:37.900 --> 54:42.570
You call Lieutenant Hendrix.
16th Precinct. Go on.

54:43.447 --> 54:45.239
Go on. Ask her.

54:58.378 --> 55:00.546
Your boyfriend owns the building.

55:00.714 --> 55:02.965
I bet you didn't know that, did you?

55:03.884 --> 55:06.177
He didn't tell you, did he?

55:07.095 --> 55:08.638
Yes, he did.

55:09.139 --> 55:13.100
You know how difficult it was
for the police to discover that?

55:13.268 --> 55:16.521
This guy has more false fronts,
more high-powered attorneys...

55:16.730 --> 55:18.105
...than Richard fucking Nixon.

55:18.315 --> 55:20.233
You know what I think?

55:20.734 --> 55:23.486
I think you can't write anymore.

55:23.654 --> 55:29.158
And I think you're making this up
to hide the fact that you can't.

55:30.077 --> 55:32.495
I'm sorry for you, Jack.

55:33.747 --> 55:35.623
I really am.

55:36.917 --> 55:39.418
But if I ever find you in my apartment again...

55:39.586 --> 55:42.213
...I'm gonna have you
thrown out of the building.

55:50.222 --> 55:52.098
Goodbye.

56:51.116 --> 56:52.325
Are you hungry?

56:55.412 --> 56:58.372
- I've already eaten.
- Liar.

56:58.874 --> 57:00.082
You're afraid of me.

57:00.292 --> 57:05.421
Do I look like a girl
who would be frightened of you?

57:06.340 --> 57:08.925
I did come on strong yesterday.

57:09.092 --> 57:13.054
Well, I came on strong too.

57:13.597 --> 57:15.973
Do you want to go out for truffles?

57:16.600 --> 57:18.267
Truffles?

57:18.477 --> 57:22.730
- Now?
- Yeah, why not? l love truffles.

57:24.107 --> 57:28.486
- I don't have anything to wear.
- Wear what l sent you.

57:29.404 --> 57:31.364
Meet me downstairs in one hour.

57:31.990 --> 57:35.660
Hurry. One hour.

57:48.131 --> 57:51.509
- Taxi.
- Did you think l wasn't coming?

57:53.387 --> 57:54.428
No.

57:56.473 --> 57:59.725
I knew you wanted me to think
that you weren't coming.

58:01.895 --> 58:03.145
You look good enough to eat.

58:18.120 --> 58:22.748
- Are you ready to order yet, sir?
- Not yet, thank you.

58:23.250 --> 58:25.167
Very well, sir.

58:25.502 --> 58:28.379
- Your check, sir.
- Oh, thank you very much.

58:28.547 --> 58:31.340
- What?
- Nothing.

58:33.343 --> 58:35.928
You like playing games, don't you?

58:36.096 --> 58:39.598
I like playing games
with people who like playing games.

58:40.892 --> 58:43.436
What game do I like to play?

58:45.480 --> 58:47.356
Scrabble?

58:47.566 --> 58:51.360
I hate Scrabble
because I’m awful at Scrabble.

58:53.363 --> 58:56.991
- I like poker, though.
- So do l.

58:57.159 --> 59:00.995
- Would you like to play?
- Now?

59:01.538 --> 59:03.164
Right now.

59:05.042 --> 59:07.251
The police came to see me today.

59:08.170 --> 59:12.506
Found out I owned the building
and were asking all sorts of questions...

59:12.716 --> 59:14.300
...about the wiring.

59:14.885 --> 59:18.387
I had such a terrible day,
I couldn't get any work done.

59:20.474 --> 59:22.933
Are we playing poker now?

59:25.353 --> 59:26.937
We're about to start.

59:30.442 --> 59:32.735
Did you like the bra and panties?

59:34.112 --> 59:35.112
Yes.

59:36.198 --> 59:37.490
Are you wearing them?

59:42.579 --> 59:43.996
Maybe.

59:45.082 --> 59:47.124
I think you are.

59:48.877 --> 59:49.960
Show me.

59:50.587 --> 59:53.464
- Right here?
- Right here.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:08.479
I'm sorry. l can't see that.
I'm near sighted.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.422
Can you see this?

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:37.758
Yes.

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:43.931
What about the panties?

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:46.725
Panties?

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:48.269
Yes. The panties.

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:50.146
Are you wearing the panties?

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.314
Forget it.

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:56.443
I win, you lose, this game.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:22.303
I can't tell.

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:54.251
I win, you lose.

01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:58.047
This game.

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:04.136
Are you ready to, uh, order yet, sir?

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.022
Where are we going?

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:21.195
- Thirteen.
- It's an unlucky number.

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:24.740
It's an unlucky apartment building.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:41.840
Good night.

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:46.303
Put these on.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.306
I wouldn't want you to catch a draft.

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:55.896
I'm okay. I'm pretty warm down there.

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.067
See you soon.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:51.660
Zeke?

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.501
Hello?

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:50.219
Damn you. You left the door open.

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.638
You knew I'd come.

01:04:52.847 --> 01:04:55.182
I thought we came together.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.812
Did you and Naomi come together?

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:03.315
I hardly knew her. l told you.

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:08.153
She told someone
you had an affair with her.

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:13.951
That's crazy. She came on to me once.

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:16.412
Maybe she fantasized.

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:19.706
I heard she had an affair
with your friend.

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:23.460
- What friend?
- Your writer friend, Jack.

01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:29.883
- Who told you that?
- Your neighbor Vida.

01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:35.055
She told me at your party. No big deal.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:41.728
If you stay,
you could wake up in my arms.

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:45.065
We could kiss to start the day.

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:48.527
I could make you breakfast.

01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:52.197
We could go for a walk in the park
and hold hands.

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.536
Am l scaring you again?

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:02.332
I don't wanna get hurt.

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:06.396
Hi, this is Vida. Leave a message.

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:12.194
Vida? Vida, are you there? It's Carly Norris.

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:14.655
Vida, I need to talk to you about something.

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:16.698
Can you give me a call?

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:20.494
It's really important.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:29.127
- Hello?
- Jack, it's Carly Norris.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:30.754
Hey.

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:36.843
Look, clearly this is
none of my business, but, uh...

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:42.516
...Vida told me that it was you...

01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:45.477
...that was having the affair
with Naomi Singer.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:47.563
That's bullshit.

01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:49.565
Vida tell you that?

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:53.277
No, l think your boyfriend
told you that, didn't he?

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:55.737
Vida didn't tell you that, did she?

01:08:38.573 --> 01:08:40.741
Oh, no.

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:56.465
Hey, Vida.

01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:58.759
Hi, I got your message.
I'll call you tonight.

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.510
I've got a job and I'm late.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.928
I just--

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:04.305
I just wanted to--

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:06.308
I don't wanna get caught in there.

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:09.269
- Vida, I wanted to talk to you.
- I'll call you later, okay?

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:13.439
Well, okay.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.764
Shit.

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:49.810
Fucking building.

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:48.952
You just lie there. Be still.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:52.622
Are you happy now? Are you happy?

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:58.253
Carly?

01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:01.298
Oh, Jesus!

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:10.432
Carly, don't run!

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:51.890
Did Miss Warren know Jack Landsford?

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:53.600
I think so.

01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:58.021
Because I saw Jack and Vida on the street.

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:02.484
- When was that?
- About a week ago.

01:12:04.695 --> 01:12:07.280
Jack was giving her some money.

01:12:09.408 --> 01:12:11.535
This isn't your knife, is it, Jack?

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:14.287
I don't think so.

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:17.207
Hey, Jack, you know Vida Warren?

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:20.585
No. I mean, uh, yeah.

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:22.629
I met her once at Carly Norris' party.

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:25.507
You're somewhat of a player, aren't you?

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:27.717
With the ladies, I mean.

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:31.513
I date, sure.
So do you, McCracken, you hump.

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:35.851
- You dating Vida Warren?
- No.

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:39.062
Oh, Jack. We got a problem.

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:42.983
We found these pictures of you
all over her apartment.

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:48.572
Those are my publicity photos.
I keep them in my desk.

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:52.284
Aw--

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:54.411
He set me up.

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:57.163
- Goddamn it, he set me up.
- Who set you up, Jack?

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.541
Zeke Hawkins, the guy in 13-A.
You talked to him yet?

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:02.377
Why would he want to do that?

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:07.299
A woman.

01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:09.843
A woman. What woman?

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:11.386
Naomi Singer. Remember her?

01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:13.555
- The suicide?
- Yeah.

01:13:13.764 --> 01:13:17.976
You got any idea why this Singer woman
would wanna kill herself, Jack?

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:22.522
No. Hey, you guys know me.
I'm trying to find out. That's my craft.

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:24.357
Were you seeing her, Jack?

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:26.651
Yeah.

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:30.906
We got women dying all over
the place around you, don't we, Jack?

01:13:31.699 --> 01:13:33.909
- Fuck you, McCracken.
- Hey, fuck you, Jack!

01:13:34.118 --> 01:13:35.160
Back off, will you?

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:36.912
- Mac.
- Take it easy, Jack.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:39.456
- Jesus Christ.
- You tell him to take it easy.

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:43.168
What's the matter with you guys?
You know me. I didn't do this.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.921
- I want my attorney.
- All right.

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:48.673
You spent part of the year
up in Montana.

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:51.593
- You got some kind of a ranch there?
- Yes, so what?

01:13:51.802 --> 01:13:53.637
- What's the name of that place?
- The name?

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:55.513
- Yeah, the name.
- The Flying L.

01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:57.682
The Flying L, huh?

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:04.648
You parking your horse
in Vida Warren's closet?

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:07.734
- I want my attorney now. Now.
- All right. You'll get him.

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:10.111
The D.A. is gonna charge him.

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:14.574
He will make bail.

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:30.382
He's coming back here, isn't he?

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:35.136
We'll know it if he does.

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:38.264
How will we know?
He could be there right now.

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:43.186
Let's see if he is.

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:50.276
Come on.

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:57.909
You know my mother was an actress
on the soaps?

01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:00.537
She used to spend
most of the year in L.A.

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:04.457
I used to take a cab home from school
and watch her on TV.

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:08.461
That was just about my life with her.

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:13.299
I had it custom-built in Osaka.

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:16.219
It cost me $6 million.

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:22.642
He's not there.

01:15:23.394 --> 01:15:25.770
We'll know if he is, though.

01:15:32.653 --> 01:15:35.613
Tomorrow night.
Yeah, I have to be in at 5.

01:15:35.823 --> 01:15:39.034
No, it's me. Can you believe it?
There must have been 600 girls.

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:40.994
Put my apartment on.

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:44.205
- There's nobody home there, either.
- Put it on.

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:47.208
Aren't you gonna come meet us?

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:52.130
Yeah, we're gonna be there in
about a half hour, if I can get ready.

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.633
No, l think Henry will be there.

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:57.677
No, he just called me 20 minutes ago.

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:01.514
What does that have to do with
anything? Have you slept with her?

01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:03.641
Did you sleep with her?
Simple question.

01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:05.769
You're making me do something
l don't want to do.

01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:07.312
l know.

01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:11.649
You watch them?

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:16.237
- You watch these people?
- So do you, Carly, with your telescope.

01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:19.074
- Oh, you....
- I just have better technology.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:27.373
You want gossip?
I'll give you real gossip. Real life, Carly.

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:31.503
It's better than any book.
Better than any movie.

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:35.715
It's a soap opera. It's real life.

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:39.219
It's a tragedy, it's funny,
it's sad, it's unpredictable.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:43.139
- Look for yourself, Carly.
- It's wrong.

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:45.308
It's the same as your James Dean book.

01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:46.601
Only nobody gets hurt.

01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:47.977
- You ready?
- Yes.

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:52.607
They don't even know.

01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:55.443
Open the door, Zeke.

01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:58.696
Look, Carly, don't....

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:04.953
I love you.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:35.919
Give me a little bit more time,
for God's sake.

01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:45.970
You will ride with your dad, okay?
That's it. No more.

01:18:49.767 --> 01:18:52.685
He's not my father,
and I'm not riding with him alone.

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:54.687
Get back in here!
Joanie! Come here.

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:56.231
You be nicer to him!

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:59.609
- He touches me.
- Stop it!

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:02.862
He puts his hands on me, Mom,
every chance he gets.

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:05.073
Don't start. I don't wanna hear it.

01:19:05.282 --> 01:19:08.618
He is a decent, hard-working man.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:10.703
l hate him! I hate him!

01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:15.541
- Don't you....
- I hate you, Mom! I hate you!

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:21.756
The little girl’s right.
Every chance he gets.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:24.092
I hate him, l really do. l hate him.

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:27.470
Whenever the mother's not around,
he's got his hands all over her.

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:53.705
Why don't you give it a try?
You just have to tap the touch screen.

01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:10.763
There are some alternatives.
l realize you're in a lot of pain.

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:25.880
- Would you like something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:28.508
You haven't eaten anything all day.

01:21:33.514 --> 01:21:35.306
You're like a kid with a new toy.

01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:39.519
But it's not a toy, is it?

01:21:41.438 --> 01:21:42.605
No.

01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:45.400
Are you the one
that sent me the telescope?

01:21:45.984 --> 01:21:47.110
Yes.

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:51.239
Why did you do that?

01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:00.623
Not now, honey.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:02.667
What did the x-ray show?

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:05.461
Some kind of shadow, that's all.

01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:08.047
Don't worry. It could be anything.

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:11.884
Baby, please tell me everything.
What did he say?

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:18.599
- He said it might be a tumor.
- A tumor?

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.768
Were you watching Vida
when she got killed?

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:26.274
No. The lights had gone down
in the stairwell.

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:28.443
What about the others?

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:30.194
I wasn't watching.

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:34.740
I did see Gus Hale on the floor of the shower.
I was the one who called the police.

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:36.742
Do you tape these?

01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:39.829
Yes.

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.458
Did you tape us?

01:22:44.001 --> 01:22:45.710
Would you like to see?

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:51.048
Yes.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.436
There's so much on this tape.

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:05.646
Come on, where is it?

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:08.900
Sometimes I just let it run on record
in one apartment for a while.

01:23:09.109 --> 01:23:11.402
Like my own little soap opera.

01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:15.823
I don't have the time
to watch most of what I record.

01:23:17.075 --> 01:23:19.952
It's amazing what l've found
on these tapes.

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:12.588
Good morning.

01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:03.973
Oh, God. Are you all right?

01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:05.391
- Carly.
- I'm fine.

01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:07.727
We've been worried.
Everybody's been calling.

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:10.271
I spent the weekend
with an impotent maniac...

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:13.482
...hoping that he'd, you know....
The police even talked to me.

01:25:13.734 --> 01:25:14.775
Carly Norris.

01:25:14.985 --> 01:25:17.111
- Will you come see me...
- It's Zeke Hawkins.

01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:19.905
...and tell me the real skinny?
I wanna hear everything.

01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:25.411
- Hello?
- Hey, guess what?

01:25:26.038 --> 01:25:29.332
I called Ballinger, you know
the guy who can't keep his hands...

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:31.542
...off his stepdaughter?

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:34.795
l told him if he ever touched her again,
I’d kill him.

01:25:35.672 --> 01:25:39.258
- What did he do?
- He panicked, that's what he did.

01:25:39.426 --> 01:25:41.302
I wish you could have heard him.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:44.388
Maybe we should
start wiring the whole town, huh?

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:47.224
That way we could see everything.

01:25:50.854 --> 01:25:52.480
You there, Carly?

01:25:53.106 --> 01:25:54.857
I don't know what to do.

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:01.030
Just come home, you.

01:26:01.948 --> 01:26:04.784
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:50.663
Don't you scream.
Don't. I’m not gonna hurt you.

01:26:50.831 --> 01:26:54.166
He set me up, Carly. Zeke set me up.

01:26:54.334 --> 01:26:58.337
I believe you. I do, I believe you.

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:02.842
It's okay. Let me go. Let me go.

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:07.179
He's sick. That man is sick.

01:27:07.764 --> 01:27:11.350
His mother died when he was 17.
She was a soap opera actress.

01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:13.644
Do you know how she died? She fell.

01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:15.771
- She fell?
- She fell in the shower.

01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:17.314
- Look!
- What?

01:27:17.524 --> 01:27:21.944
Look, Carly. Thea Manning.
That's his mother, Carly.

01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:24.238
- Who does she look like?
- Oh, she....

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.992
She looks like you, Carly.

01:27:36.543 --> 01:27:38.627
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:40.671
Hey, are you coming down?

01:27:41.673 --> 01:27:45.551
- Why don't you come over here?
- Why? What's up?

01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:49.346
Well, because l have a surprise for you.

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:52.391
Great. I’ll be right there.

01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:54.727
Okay.

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:58.856
- Sit down.
- Okay.

01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:10.910
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:13.871
A little dark in here, don't you think?

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:16.707
- He's got a gun!
- Sit down! All right, bastard!

01:28:16.917 --> 01:28:19.001
Tell the truth,
or I’ll blow your brains out.

01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:22.129
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You killed Naomi Singer.

01:28:22.339 --> 01:28:23.380
No, I didn't.

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:25.966
- How'd your mother die, Zeke, hmm?
- My mother?

01:28:26.176 --> 01:28:28.344
Yeah, she fell in the shower,
wasn't that it?

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:30.054
She had an aneurysm and fell.

01:28:30.263 --> 01:28:32.932
She fell in the shower
the way you killed Gus Hale.

01:28:33.099 --> 01:28:35.726
- Gus Hale?
- Yeah, and he killed Vida too.

01:28:35.936 --> 01:28:38.479
Didn't you? Didn't you?

01:28:38.647 --> 01:28:42.650
Three now, Jack? l killed three people?

01:28:42.818 --> 01:28:45.319
First of all, l didn't know Naomi Singer.

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:48.989
But you did, Jack.
Because I saw you with her.

01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:52.785
- So I know why you would want to kill her.
- What do you mean, you saw us?

01:28:52.953 --> 01:28:56.247
I saw her give you a key
to this apartment.

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.291
Is that how he got in here
this time, huh?

01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:01.669
- Is it?
- You still have the key, don't you?

01:29:01.878 --> 01:29:04.922
- Why don't you show us, huh?
- What are you talking about?

01:29:05.131 --> 01:29:08.300
I'm talking about the fact that you
couldn't get it up, could you?

01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:11.929
I saw that too.
Is that why you killed her, Jack?

01:29:12.097 --> 01:29:15.850
- Is it? Is it?
- He's lying, Carly. He's lying.

01:29:16.059 --> 01:29:17.560
I don't know what to believe.

01:29:17.769 --> 01:29:19.186
Just show me the key.

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:25.317
No, Jack! No.

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:45.462
Jack, let go! Jack. No!

01:29:55.807 --> 01:30:01.687
Because he was already in this room,
but I didn't see him.

01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:05.774
And when he came out,
I saw that he had a gun.

01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:09.194
He started screaming at me.

01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:11.697
And....

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:18.370
Sorry.

01:30:18.705 --> 01:30:24.168
And we, um, wrestled around
on the ground.

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:26.086
And, uh...

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:31.133
...the gun skidded across the floor there...

01:30:32.385 --> 01:30:34.970
...and I picked it up.

01:30:36.723 --> 01:30:38.515
How did he get in?

01:30:39.017 --> 01:30:41.143
Your door wasn't forced.

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:46.273
He must have had a key.

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:48.859
It was just like before.
He was already in here.

01:30:49.069 --> 01:30:51.153
He had these in his pocket.

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:53.822
Try them.

01:31:05.877 --> 01:31:09.088
Jack Landsford's got a sheet with us.
He's a known offender.

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:14.343
Assaulted his ex-wife more than once.
She dropped charges.

01:31:14.511 --> 01:31:16.261
I wish she hadn't.

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:18.514
Maybe we wouldn't
have two women dead.

01:31:20.392 --> 01:31:21.976
He didn't get in with these.

01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:26.981
- You guys about done here?
- Finished.

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:32.569
- Where?
- Floor, next to the counter.

01:31:33.655 --> 01:31:35.447
This yours?

01:31:36.533 --> 01:31:37.574
No.

01:31:51.256 --> 01:31:52.881
Bingo.

01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:54.758
Well, that wraps it.

01:31:54.926 --> 01:31:58.637
The D.A.'s gonna need to see you both
tomorrow morning...

01:31:58.805 --> 01:32:01.223
...down at the precinct. Say, 9:30?

01:32:03.018 --> 01:32:04.810
You know where it is.

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:09.231
Let's secure it.

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:32.546
I don't....

01:32:34.716 --> 01:32:36.967
I don't want to stay here tonight.

01:32:37.719 --> 01:32:45.476
Stay with me.

01:32:46.853 --> 01:32:48.187
Okay?

01:32:51.441 --> 01:32:53.776
Joanie, can we talk for a minute?

01:33:00.033 --> 01:33:04.036
Have you told anyone that I, uh....

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:09.124
- Just Mom.
- You're sure?

01:33:09.667 --> 01:33:10.876
Mm-hm.

01:33:13.463 --> 01:33:16.256
Joanie, I'm sorry.

01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:20.761
It was just-- l couldn't help myself.

01:33:22.722 --> 01:33:27.101
It'll never happen again.
l swear it. Never.

01:33:33.191 --> 01:33:34.817
It's like playing God.

01:33:35.527 --> 01:33:39.321
- We'll only do good things.
- I don't want to do this.

01:33:39.531 --> 01:33:44.201
I want my privacy.
I want my own experiences.

01:33:44.911 --> 01:33:47.579
Zeke, I want to have a real relationship.

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:50.874
Carly, I love you.
You can have anything you want.

01:33:52.544 --> 01:33:54.711
I want my tape.

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:58.382
If I have you, l don't need them, right?

01:34:01.136 --> 01:34:02.678
Hold on.

01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:46.180
Erased.

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:51.768
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:54.188
Tired.

01:34:55.023 --> 01:34:56.773
And hungry, I guess.

01:34:57.901 --> 01:35:00.652
I'll go get something for us.
What would you like?

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:02.905
Anything.

01:35:06.868 --> 01:35:08.994
You're so beautiful.

01:35:16.753 --> 01:35:18.462
Be right back.

01:36:12.016 --> 01:36:14.059
You're so beautiful, Vida.

01:36:21.693 --> 01:36:23.652
I love you.

01:36:23.987 --> 01:36:46.550
You smell so good.

01:36:51.973 --> 01:36:54.224
I love you, Naomi.

01:36:57.687 --> 01:37:00.480
I love you. You smell like roses.

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:35.682
Carly.

01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:39.519
Come on. Come on, open the door!
Let's go. Open up!

01:37:42.023 --> 01:37:44.191
Hey, come on!

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:04.961
Carly...

01:38:06.839 --> 01:38:09.091
...you're watching me, aren't you?

01:38:14.389 --> 01:38:16.515
Are you looking at me?

01:38:17.809 --> 01:38:22.562
You're looking at me.
I can tell, I can feel it.

01:38:24.273 --> 01:38:26.316
I love you, Carly.

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:34.574
Carly, let me in. Come on.

01:38:35.535 --> 01:38:38.995
Peekaboo. You see me.

01:38:39.163 --> 01:38:41.540
Come on, open the door. Now.

01:38:41.707 --> 01:38:45.210
Now, Carly! Open the fucking door!

01:38:45.378 --> 01:38:47.879
Come on,
open this cocksucking door, now!

01:38:48.798 --> 01:38:51.633
Open up. Come on.

01:38:53.302 --> 01:38:56.721
Open the fucking door, Carly, now!

01:39:16.576 --> 01:39:20.454
You like to watch? Watch this.

01:39:21.664 --> 01:39:23.957
Carly! No, stop!

01:39:32.842 --> 01:39:34.843
Those women meant nothing to me.

01:39:35.595 --> 01:39:37.429
It was just sex, Carly.

01:39:40.016 --> 01:39:41.725
I love you.

01:39:48.858 --> 01:39:50.942
That was the past.

01:39:51.694 --> 01:39:54.196
What we have is so powerful, Carly.
Can't you feel it?

01:39:55.364 --> 01:39:57.324
It feels so good.

01:39:58.159 --> 01:39:59.993
You can feel it, can't you?

01:40:03.206 --> 01:40:05.373
Give me the gun, Carly.

01:40:10.755 --> 01:40:12.672
I love you, Carly.

01:40:47.542 --> 01:40:49.042
Carly!

01:40:51.295 --> 01:40:53.797
Carly, please! Please don't!

01:40:55.508 --> 01:40:57.133
Carly, please don't!

01:40:57.301 --> 01:40:58.760
Carly!

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:10.730
Get a life.
