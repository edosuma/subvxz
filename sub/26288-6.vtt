You gotta go, you gotta go.

That Halloween gag

nearly scared me half to death.

Gag

What did you do?

00:34.208 --> 00:36.427
My boss is gonna kill me.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.864
Me? I just got here.All right, pal,

I'm working the graveyard shift

JIMMY: Do you know
that Halloween's origins

01:43.494 --> 01:46.889
come from the Celtic festival
for the dead called Samhain?

01:48.630 --> 01:50.588
I'm not much of a Halloween guy.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.460
Yeah.
Neither are the Celts.

01:52.503 --> 01:54.984
They believed that ghosts roamed
the earth on All Hallows' Eve,

01:55.027 --> 01:58.074
so they'd dress up in costumes,
leave little treats

01:58.118 --> 02:01.251
along their doorsteps just
to appease the evil spirits.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.079
Yeah? Appease me.
What do you got?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.515
Petty Officer,
uh, Tim Buckley.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.038
Well, at least
that's what

02:06.082 --> 02:07.953
his ID says.Yeah.

Who's he?Still working on an ID.

02:13.481 --> 02:14.960
But is it me,
or does this guy

02:15.004 --> 02:16.266
look familiar?

02:16.310 --> 02:17.441
There's a lot
of blood.

02:17.485 --> 02:18.442
No footprints.

02:18.486 --> 02:19.530
Oh, you noticed?

02:19.574 --> 02:20.966
Either the killer

02:21.010 --> 02:22.794
floated out or, uh,

02:22.838 --> 02:24.100
these two killed
each other.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.755
Before or after his slit throat?

02:26.798 --> 02:28.670
Let's not forget
the broken neck.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.585
So I'm going with floated out.

02:30.628 --> 02:33.892
It is All Hallows' Eve,
gentlemen.

02:33.936 --> 02:35.546

02:35.590 --> 02:37.069
a Celtic evil spirit.

I-I was just joking,

02:40.029 --> 02:40.986
that you...

02:41.030 --> 02:42.814
I was just making mirth.

02:42.858 --> 02:45.034
I don't even believe
in evil spirits.

02:45.077 --> 02:47.515
Though, that being said...Okay, here it comes.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.995
Okay, have you noticed
anything strange going on

02:50.039 --> 02:51.997
at the office lately?

from McGee, uh,

No, not really.

03:22.245 --> 03:25.030
Do you, uh, recognize
either of the victims?

03:25.074 --> 03:26.902
Never seen 'em
before tonight.

03:26.945 --> 03:29.296
Anyone suspicious
come in or out?

03:29.339 --> 03:32.603
Uh, yeah. Tons of suspicious
people come in and out.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.170

03:34.214 --> 03:35.171
MAN:
Come on, man, bathroom!

03:35.215 --> 03:36.041
The next one's

03:36.085 --> 03:37.391
not for 20 miles.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.262
Hey, hey, who
the heck is she?

03:39.306 --> 03:41.090
MAN: What? I've been
driving all night.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.439
They are not happy.

03:42.483 --> 03:43.875
Must be all the coffee.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.137
We're not gonna see much

03:45.181 --> 03:46.443
from the security footage.

03:46.487 --> 03:47.705
Wires were cut.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.881
Well, I saw something:

03:49.925 --> 03:51.056
both those dead guys

03:51.100 --> 03:52.014
go into the bathroom.

03:52.057 --> 03:54.277
Did you see anyone
go in after?

03:54.321 --> 03:55.670
That's the thing.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.541
Nobody went in
after them.

03:57.585 --> 03:58.542
Not until him.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.065
And they were already dead.

04:00.109 --> 04:02.242
Well, they didn't
kill themselves.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.425
Uh, Tim? I'm starting
to worry about you.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.862
Hey, laugh all you want,
but people that sit all day

04:13.905 --> 04:15.777
are twice as likely
to get heart disease

04:15.820 --> 04:17.996
than those that stand.All right, talk to me.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.433
Uh, the first victim you know

04:19.476 --> 04:21.304
as Navy Petty Officer

04:21.348 --> 04:23.175
Third Class Tim Buckley.

04:23.219 --> 04:24.568
Yeah, went on leave yesterday.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.091
C.O. said he was driving home

04:26.135 --> 04:27.310
to visit his parents
in Philadelphia.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.356
Unfortunately,
we're still trying to ID

04:29.399 --> 04:30.574
the second victim.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.054
No, we're not.

04:32.097 --> 04:35.057
According to his DNA,

04:35.100 --> 04:37.189
victim number two is...

04:37.233 --> 04:39.061
Anderson Kohl.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.802
Uh, yeah.
He's a former Marine.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.151
Who failed out of a FLETC

04:42.194 --> 04:44.806
survival training class in 2006.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.373
A friend of yours?

04:46.416 --> 04:49.027
Man, I knew this guy
looked familiar.

04:49.071 --> 04:52.030
I-I took the same class
before I went undercover.

04:52.074 --> 04:54.119
This guy was a rock star.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.251
Yeah, but you said
he failed out.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.818
Yeah, he had an
authority problem.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.168
But he was good.
He was really good.

04:59.211 --> 05:02.998
How'd he end up dead
in a truck stop bathroom?

05:03.041 --> 05:04.173
I don't know.

05:04.216 --> 05:06.567
We were close during training.

05:06.610 --> 05:09.091
We were always trying
to one-up each other.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.049
Then we lost touch
after he failed out.

05:11.093 --> 05:14.139
Well, he's got no work record,
no social media presence,

05:14.183 --> 05:17.360
but he lives here in D.C.,
rents a condo in Georgetown.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.666
Go, Torres.

05:18.709 --> 05:19.971
Take Bishop
with you.

05:28.153 --> 05:30.417
WOMAN :
Be right with you.

05:32.201 --> 05:36.727
Oh, okay, this is not how I
pictured Anderson Kohl living.

05:36.771 --> 05:39.730
Oh... my God.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.123
Check that out.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.385
Yep, it's a car.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.213
No, you don't understand.

05:44.256 --> 05:47.564
This car is worth more than
both of our salaries combined.

05:47.608 --> 05:50.175
No way. Really?

05:50.219 --> 05:51.699
I still don't care.

05:51.742 --> 05:54.136
Yo, NCIS should
give us these cars.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.051
Because the bad guys
would never outrun us.

05:56.094 --> 05:58.227
Hey, cool your jets, Will Smith.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.228
This isn't Bad Boys.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.624
Good morning.Oh.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.016
You must be
the government people.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.323
Uh, yep.
Agents Bishop and Torres.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.412
Rachel Brentwood.
I'm the owner of the building.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.675
Nice to meet you.
Uh, a building

06:11.719 --> 06:13.416
that has some tenants
with some serious bank.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.287
Had.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.159
Now that Mr. Kohl has died,
I'm gonna have to find

06:17.202 --> 06:18.508
someone to replace him.

06:18.552 --> 06:21.119
Wait, Kohl was the only one
who lived here?

06:21.163 --> 06:24.166
Oh, there are actually two
units. I live in the second.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.168
Oh, okay, so these
are your cars.

06:26.211 --> 06:28.475
Of course not.
I have my own garage.

06:28.518 --> 06:31.086
No, these all belong
to Mr. Kohl.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.827
Hold on. Are we
talking about

06:32.870 --> 06:35.482
the same Anderson Kohl
that we'retalking about?

06:35.525 --> 06:38.398
Wait until you see his condo.

06:40.182 --> 06:41.923
Whoa.Hmm.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.452
Are those heated tiles
in the bathroom?

06:49.496 --> 06:51.236
Along with gold-threaded
shower curtains

06:51.280 --> 06:52.977
and a self-cleaning toilet.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.979
Wow, I am never
using my bathroom again.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.459
Oh, wow, really?

06:56.503 --> 06:57.939
You don't care about cars,
but that toilet-- wow,

06:57.982 --> 06:59.331
that just puts
you over the edge?

06:59.375 --> 07:01.899
Okay. Can you focus?

07:01.943 --> 07:04.380
So, Kohl--
what'd he do for money?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.208
And by that, I mean...

07:06.251 --> 07:08.471
how much does a place
like this cost?

07:08.515 --> 07:11.387
Well, you know the old saying:
if you have to ask...

07:11.431 --> 07:13.258
♪ I got girls, I got girls Oh, sorry.

07:13.302 --> 07:14.390
♪ I got girls Sorry.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.739
Sorry.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.219
♪ I got...

07:17.262 --> 07:20.614
Oh, wow.
Look at that.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.529
Mm-hmm.
How nice for him.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.400
Friends, girlfriends?

07:24.444 --> 07:26.576
And please don't tell me
he dated a supermodel,

07:26.620 --> 07:28.535
'cause I'll be jumping
out a window.

07:28.578 --> 07:29.884
Yeah, we've been having trouble

07:29.927 --> 07:31.102
tracking down
anyone who knew him.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.452
Mr. Kohl was a model tenant.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.976
Quiet, private.
I rarely saw him.

07:38.153 --> 07:41.243
And I have never
seen that before.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.593
You're sure that
doesn't come standard?

07:43.637 --> 07:46.335
I have no idea
what this is.

07:47.728 --> 07:50.295
Oh... what?

07:50.339 --> 07:53.124
Well, fake passports.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.434
Licenses.
Who was this guy?

08:07.791 --> 08:09.750
TORRES:
Zurich, Tokyo.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.360
Who goes to Guam?

08:11.403 --> 08:12.492
Where is Barotseland?

08:12.535 --> 08:14.494
Africa.
What's it got to do with Kohl?

08:14.537 --> 08:15.669
Well, we're going through
all the identities

08:15.712 --> 08:17.235
that Torres and Bishop

08:17.279 --> 08:18.498
found in Kohl's apartment.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.500
We found over 20 aliases.

08:20.543 --> 08:22.066
They're popping up
all over the world.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.415
He boarded a plane to Kiev

08:23.459 --> 08:25.983
with a Russian passport
three months ago.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.376
And Colombian customs
has him entering

08:27.419 --> 08:29.987
as Juan Perales
after that.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.423
How long was he there?

08:31.467 --> 08:32.903
He never stays longer
than two days.

08:32.947 --> 08:34.862
Maybe he's working for somebody.

08:34.905 --> 08:37.255
Well, we called CIA,
Homeland, FBI.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.779
He's not any of theirs.

08:38.822 --> 08:41.303
You know, when I was undercover,
I had a few aliases,

08:41.346 --> 08:42.522
but nothing like this.

08:42.565 --> 08:45.307
I knew a lot
of smugglers who did.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.613
Okay.
What's he smuggling?

08:46.656 --> 08:49.790
Drugs, guns.
People?

08:49.833 --> 08:51.792
You asking me or you telling me?

08:51.835 --> 08:53.445
I don't know,
is there another option?

08:53.489 --> 08:55.578
Sure.
Go find it.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.505
Hey, Kasie.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.116
What are you doing here?

09:12.160 --> 09:14.205
Uh, I was just checking in
for an update.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.556
Who told you
there was an update?

09:17.774 --> 09:19.036
Was it Jimmy

09:19.080 --> 09:20.995
Whoa. Uh, you know what?

09:21.038 --> 09:22.387
I'm gonna come back later.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.041
No, stop. No.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.390
I'm sorry.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.218
You have no reason to apologize.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.785
Did I apologize, or...?

09:28.829 --> 09:30.570
This isn't your fault.

09:30.613 --> 09:33.921
You're not the one who refused
to clean your bathroom ever.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.444
Ooh. No, that would be Torres.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.446
There is just so
much contamination.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.187
I mean, when
Gibbs first said

09:39.230 --> 09:41.493
"truck stop bathroom,"
I thought, "Oh, oh, sure,

09:41.537 --> 09:42.625
this might be a bit rough."

09:42.669 --> 09:44.627
But there's too much.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.586
I mean, look at all this.

09:46.629 --> 09:47.717
Yeah, it's gross.

09:47.761 --> 09:50.372
Have you ever swabbed
a urinal cake?

09:50.415 --> 09:52.374
Uh, is that a trick question?

09:52.417 --> 09:54.942
Because I just added
that to my résumé.

09:54.985 --> 09:58.728
I mean, do you have
any idea how much DNA

09:58.772 --> 10:00.643
men just leave
around a bathroom?

10:00.687 --> 10:02.645
And I don't even want
to say what else.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.386
Uh, I don't want you to, either.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.214
The entire crime
scene is unusable.

10:06.257 --> 10:08.216
I will never
find the killer's DNA

10:08.259 --> 10:10.000
in that cesspool.Okay.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.873
Have we had a chance to look
at any of the other evidence?

10:12.916 --> 10:14.657
Oh, you mean
the victim's cell phone

10:14.701 --> 10:16.441
that I still
need to finish cracking

10:16.485 --> 10:18.400
and do a full data search on?

10:18.443 --> 10:19.793
Okay. I'm just gonna go.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.490
Or were you referring to
the entire evidence garage

10:21.533 --> 10:23.274
of personal belongings
that I still need

10:23.318 --> 10:25.668
to sort, categorize...

10:25.712 --> 10:28.018
JIMMY:
Okay, here I am.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.020
Just going home for the night.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.022
And now we're gonna
see who's coming in

10:32.066 --> 10:34.590
and messing with my stuff.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.684
Oh, th...
that's just me, again.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.555
You all right, Palmer?

10:43.599 --> 10:45.035
Oh, j...
I... Yes.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.037
No. I mean...

10:47.081 --> 10:49.649
Never mind.
It's just that...

10:51.476 --> 10:53.870
: ...one of the bodies
switched coolers last night.

10:53.914 --> 10:56.568
All by itself. Which is
ludicrous, right? I know.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.570
So I was just checking the
security footage to see if...

10:58.614 --> 11:00.616
If it could tell me
what you found on our victims.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.010
I think I know
where you're going with this.

11:03.053 --> 11:05.795
Uh, let's start with our mystery
man here, Anderson Kohl.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.188
Cause of death:

11:07.231 --> 11:08.493
not a mystery.

11:08.537 --> 11:09.886
Killer slit his throat.Yeah.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.497
Severed right
carotid artery.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.412
And based on the upward
pulling of the laceration...

11:14.456 --> 11:15.718
He was attacked from behind.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.720
Probably never
saw it coming.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.940
Unlike Petty
Officer Buckley...Who was beat to hell.

11:19.983 --> 11:22.507
JIMMY:
Yeah, you can see there's
multiple defensive wounds here.

11:22.551 --> 11:25.032
If I had to guess, I would
say the killer's target

11:25.075 --> 11:26.947
was Kohl, and this
poor guy was just...

11:26.990 --> 11:28.644
In the wrong place
at the wrong time.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.690
Is this a new thing,

11:30.733 --> 11:33.431
where you're gonna start
finishing all of my sentences?

11:33.475 --> 11:34.650
Got a problem with that?

11:34.694 --> 11:35.738
I'm a fan.

11:35.782 --> 11:36.783
It's like...

11:36.826 --> 11:38.436
it's like we're bonding.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.438
Over a slit throat and
a broken neck, but...

11:40.482 --> 11:41.788
I'll take it.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.355
It's not easy to break
somebody's neck.

11:44.399 --> 11:47.532
You know, and it's doubly hard
the way that the killer did it.

11:47.576 --> 11:50.187
I mean, his technique
was so good,

11:50.231 --> 11:52.189
he completely split
the spinal cord in half.

11:52.233 --> 11:54.191
Now, that's rare.

11:54.235 --> 11:57.238
This killer is
well-practiced, Gibbs.

11:57.281 --> 12:00.110
He's done this before.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.679
Whoa.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.681
Hell of a car, isn't she?

12:05.725 --> 12:08.597
She ain't a car.
She's magic.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.774
Huh. Kohl was definitely
good at spending money.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.558
He was good
at making it, too.

12:13.602 --> 12:14.821
Ooh.

12:14.864 --> 12:17.084
Do I detect a note of jealousy?

12:17.127 --> 12:18.955
Jack--

12:18.999 --> 12:21.741
I knew the guy, okay?

12:21.784 --> 12:23.917
We were equals once.
I mean, friends, even.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.789
But the guy wasn't smarter
than me or better than me.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.357
Do you think
that he's better than you now?

12:29.400 --> 12:30.837
Oh, I never said that.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.535
The guy was
a millionaire, though.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.711
I mean, he's got
a dinosaur head.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.758
I guess we all take
different doors that lead us

12:38.801 --> 12:40.760
to different paths.But what door

12:40.803 --> 12:43.763
did Kohl take
that led him to have all this?

12:43.806 --> 12:45.112
The same one

12:45.155 --> 12:47.418
that led him
to be laying in autopsy

12:47.462 --> 12:49.725
while you're searching
through his personal belongings.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.510
Speaking of which, did you
find anything interesting?

12:52.554 --> 12:54.861
Um... yeah.

12:54.904 --> 12:56.601
This lockbox
is interesting.

12:56.645 --> 12:58.734
What's inside?We couldn't get it open,

12:58.778 --> 13:00.823
but we're hoping
Kasie has better luck.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.434
Kohl had a lot
of toys, but, um,

13:03.478 --> 13:06.611
he virtually had no personal
belongings in his condo.

13:06.655 --> 13:10.050
I mean, toothbrush, deodorant.

13:10.093 --> 13:13.618
He learned how to live
without sentimental attachments.

13:13.662 --> 13:17.535
Why would he or...

13:17.579 --> 13:20.321
anyone like him...

13:20.364 --> 13:21.844
do that?

13:21.888 --> 13:24.194
I don't know.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.848
Do you?

13:31.723 --> 13:33.856
Hey, Kase.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.467
Hey, how you doing?Oh, Gibbs.

13:36.511 --> 13:40.036
Listen, I'm sure Bishop
told you about my little...

13:40.080 --> 13:41.646
toilet tantrum earlier,

13:41.690 --> 13:44.214
but I just want to say
that I've calmed down now,

13:44.258 --> 13:46.869
and all is right
on planet Kasie.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.436
Toilet tantrum?

13:48.479 --> 13:50.742
She didn't tell you?

13:50.786 --> 13:52.135
No. I was asking
about the case.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.442
Yeah, but you said,
"How you doing?"

13:54.485 --> 13:57.837
When you ask about the case,
you say, "What do you got?"

13:57.880 --> 14:00.143
I'm just saying, you know,
consistency helps.

14:00.187 --> 14:02.406
All right, fine.
What do you got?

14:02.450 --> 14:04.800
The secret to our
killer's disappearing act.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.630
So, unlike our slowly
unraveling medical examiner,

14:08.673 --> 14:10.937
I refuse to believe
in floating spirits.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.330
So I got the truck stop's
architectural blueprints

14:13.374 --> 14:16.246
and found an old, out-of-use
ventilation shaft

14:16.290 --> 14:19.249
above the ceiling tiles
in the bathroom.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.469
Large enough for a person
to crawl through.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.166
That must be how our killer
got in and out

14:23.210 --> 14:24.820
without being seen.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.823
I was also able
to break into Kohl's cell phone.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.781
He only used
a four-digit password,

14:29.825 --> 14:31.958
which most people don't realize
isn't that secure.

14:32.001 --> 14:35.222
Though you seem like
a six-digit guy, at least.

14:35.265 --> 14:37.398
I don't have a password.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.661
I'm gonna try
to not judge you now,

14:39.704 --> 14:41.271
but I may fail.

14:41.315 --> 14:44.753
Okay, so, moving on,
or back to the cell phone.

14:44.796 --> 14:47.843
What's so interesting about it
is that Kohl barely used it.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.367
Never texted a single person,
never called anyone.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.500
And no Candy Crush,
if you can believe that.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.284
So what'd he use it for?

14:54.328 --> 14:56.112
Well, the only thing
he used it for was to keep track

14:56.156 --> 14:57.157
of birthdays.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.506
So, what, we got a list

14:58.549 --> 14:59.768
of Kohl's friends?

14:59.811 --> 15:01.030
Well, not exactly.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.945
In fact, I highly doubt it.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.686
I took the liberty
of tracking down

15:04.729 --> 15:06.122
all the names on that list.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.603
Every single person
on that list is dead.

15:08.646 --> 15:11.171
Dead how?

15:11.214 --> 15:13.303
Murdered.
Kohl had a list of names

15:13.347 --> 15:16.480
of unsolved murders
from all over the world.

15:16.524 --> 15:19.092
We got victims
in Guam, Tokyo...

15:19.135 --> 15:20.789
Barotseland.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.486
Ooh.
I don't even wanna know

15:22.530 --> 15:23.879
how you knew that.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.359
How'd you know that?

15:25.402 --> 15:28.971
Pull up those trips
that Kohl's been taking.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.673
Now bring up the birth dates.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.851
Well, stiffen the wombats.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.637
Kohl was there in every city
when someone

15:42.680 --> 15:44.508
on his birthday list
was murdered.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.946
GIBBS:
Those aren't birth dates.
Those are death dates.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.077
It's a hit list.

15:48.121 --> 15:50.950
So what does that make Kohl?A hit man.

16:01.134 --> 16:04.006
Hmm.
So Kohl was a hit man.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.094
Who kills a killer?

16:05.138 --> 16:07.749
BISHOP:
Maybe it was a hit gone wrong?

16:07.792 --> 16:10.970
Maybe Kohl was trying to take
out Petty Officer Buckley,

16:11.013 --> 16:12.145
and things went sideways?

16:12.188 --> 16:14.190
Kohl was the target.

16:14.234 --> 16:16.149
Buckley just walked in
on the hit.

16:16.192 --> 16:17.977
Maybe it was
revenge.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.239
Kohl had a lot of victims.
That's a lot

16:19.282 --> 16:20.805
of angry friends
and relatives.

16:20.849 --> 16:24.026
Yeah, and these are not
the kind of victims

16:24.070 --> 16:25.897
whose buddies
will call the cops.

16:25.941 --> 16:27.334
Who are they?McGEE:
Well, we've got

16:27.377 --> 16:31.251
drug lords, mafia,
money launderers.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.295
Which one's she?

16:32.339 --> 16:34.167
That is
Jenny Wayfair.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.429
This one's
actually local.

16:35.472 --> 16:36.604
She worked at a pawn shop

16:36.647 --> 16:39.172
her boyfriend owned in Fairfax.

16:39.215 --> 16:40.912
Pawning can be
a dangerous game.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.915
I see you figured out
Kohl was a hit man.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.091
Good for you.

16:46.744 --> 16:49.312
Uh... who's that?

16:53.969 --> 16:55.971
Director Vance.Officer Clark.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.582
Call me Westley. It's nice to
finally meet you, Director.

16:58.626 --> 17:01.455
Likewise.
But have we...

17:01.498 --> 17:03.152
Have we met before?

17:03.196 --> 17:04.806
I don't think so.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.764
But I did attend
a briefing you gave

17:06.808 --> 17:07.809
at Langley last summer.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.332
Ah, that must be it.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.464
Here.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.335
Speaking of which,

17:12.379 --> 17:15.295
I hear you had quite
a summer this year.

17:15.338 --> 17:18.602
Well, that's an understatement.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.822
I did some recon on Nigel
Hakim's inner circle

17:20.865 --> 17:22.345
a while back.

17:22.389 --> 17:25.392
I know just how
terrible they can be.

17:25.435 --> 17:26.610
How they break people.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.395
You said on the phone

17:28.438 --> 17:30.701
that you wanted to talk
about Anderson Kohl.

17:30.745 --> 17:33.226
And CIA appreciates
your cooperation.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.531
We gonna get
the same from you?

17:36.098 --> 17:37.360
VANCE:
Special Agent Gibbs.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.623
You'll excuse him.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.756
We haven't had
much luck interfacing

17:41.799 --> 17:43.279
with CIA in the past.

17:43.323 --> 17:44.976
What do you know about Kohl?

17:45.020 --> 17:46.935
We've been tracking
his movements

17:46.978 --> 17:48.328
for a while now,

17:48.371 --> 17:49.677
But we've always been

17:49.720 --> 17:51.113
one step behind.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.420
Well, he's downstairs
in autopsy.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.030
Go say hello.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.425
To be honest, we're more
interested in his handler.

17:58.468 --> 18:01.428
The guy who gets him the jobs--
that's who we want to take out.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.256
Cut off the head,
kill the snake.Mm.

18:03.299 --> 18:05.214
Who's his handler?

18:05.258 --> 18:07.738
We don't have a clue.
That's why I'm here.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.479
I was hoping you could
help us find him.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.439
We're trying to solve a murder.

18:12.482 --> 18:13.701
And you don't think that

18:13.744 --> 18:15.659
if you find
Kohl's handler he might

18:15.703 --> 18:17.531
be able to
shed some light on that?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.534
Okay, so how about

18:20.577 --> 18:23.406
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine?

18:23.450 --> 18:25.452
Go on.

18:25.495 --> 18:28.063
Do you have any leads
on who took Kohl out,

18:28.107 --> 18:29.934
theories on motive?

18:29.978 --> 18:32.111
Going with revenge.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.286
Smart.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.157
Dive into the murder cases.

18:35.201 --> 18:37.464
See if maybe
a survivor got payback.

18:37.507 --> 18:38.900
But Kohl killed
a lot of people.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.249
You run down
all those suspects,

18:40.293 --> 18:42.991
that's a lot of
shoe leather.

18:43.034 --> 18:45.689
Well, perhaps CIA can help
with the international cases.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.126
Absolutely.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.432
And if you find
any information

18:49.476 --> 18:50.564
that could lead us
to Kohl's handler...

18:50.607 --> 18:52.870
Gibbs, does that
work for you?

18:52.914 --> 18:54.307
Have I got a choice?

18:54.350 --> 18:56.961
No.
But let me be clear.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.355
NCIS has a case to solve.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.314
We are not here
to be CIA's lapdog.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.881
We all want
the same thing, Director:

19:03.925 --> 19:06.275
to save lives.

19:06.319 --> 19:07.798
All right.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.322
BISHOP:
All right, I'll tell him.
Yeah, thanks.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.367
That was Torres and McGee.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.674
No luck finding
any leads so far.

19:13.717 --> 19:16.416
So, next on the list

19:16.459 --> 19:19.070
is Jenny Wayfair.

19:20.507 --> 19:21.682
Killed by Kohl
three months ago.

19:21.725 --> 19:23.901
Police investigated.

19:23.945 --> 19:26.382
All they got was a witness
who saw her in an altercation

19:26.426 --> 19:27.470
with an unidentified male

19:27.514 --> 19:29.385
the week before she died.

19:29.429 --> 19:32.519
This is her boyfriend's
place-- Bill Zaprowski.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.347
Zaprowski the kind of guy
to go after a hit man?

19:34.390 --> 19:37.350
Well, he was investigated
for laundering and racketeering

19:37.393 --> 19:40.440
but the feds could never
make any of the charges stick.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.574
Morning.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.924
Morning. You Bill?

19:46.968 --> 19:48.448
Pope wear a funny hat?

19:48.491 --> 19:52.278
Special Agent Gibbs
and Bishop, NCIS.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.671
You looking to buy, sell?

19:54.715 --> 19:57.021
Trade.We have a couple questions

19:57.065 --> 19:58.458
about your girlfriend.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.895
That's, uh....

20:00.938 --> 20:03.463
that's not my favorite
subject these days.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.116
Jenny died months ago,

20:05.160 --> 20:08.424
which I'm guessing
you already know.

20:08.468 --> 20:09.556
We know she was
murdered months ago.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.514
Yeah, and her killer's
still out there.

20:11.558 --> 20:15.039
That son of a bitch
better hope I never find him.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.520
Ah, funny you say that.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.522
Anderson Kohl.
You know him?

20:22.308 --> 20:24.614
No.You sure?

20:24.658 --> 20:26.964
My dad just said he didn't
know him. Why are you pushing?

20:27.008 --> 20:29.706
Well, maybe your dad
did find Jenny's killer.

20:31.491 --> 20:33.928
Kohl was murdered, along
with a petty officer.

20:33.971 --> 20:37.061
If you think my dad could
take out two guys at once,

20:37.105 --> 20:38.628
you're nuts.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.500
Well, he did manage to

20:40.543 --> 20:42.458
racketeer and launder
money at the same time.

20:42.502 --> 20:46.462
Okay, how did I do this?
Machine gun?

20:46.506 --> 20:48.421
Knife.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.424
Hand-to-hand combat.

20:51.467 --> 20:52.860
Two against one.

20:52.903 --> 20:56.559
Just a small problem
with that.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.169
Double bypass.

20:58.213 --> 21:00.563
Three weeks ago.

21:00.607 --> 21:03.044
BILL:
Listen, I wish it was me

21:03.087 --> 21:04.611
that killed this guy.

21:04.654 --> 21:07.091
Oh, I truly do, trust me.

21:07.135 --> 21:09.442
But I'm not your man.

21:09.485 --> 21:12.271
Though I sure as shinola
ain't gonna lose any sleep

21:12.314 --> 21:14.273
over him being murdered.

21:16.405 --> 21:17.972
McGEE:
I don't see what the problem is.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.756
Anderson Kohl's a hit man.
You're not.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.672
I've killed people, too.Yeah, but not for money.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.848
I don't get paid
to work at NCIS?

21:24.892 --> 21:26.850
It's totally different.How is it different?

21:26.894 --> 21:29.026
Name one difference
between Anderson Kohl and me.

21:29.070 --> 21:31.638
He's dead.McGee.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.292
I'm serious, man.
The dude and I

21:33.335 --> 21:35.076
had so much in common
in training.

21:35.119 --> 21:38.688
Yeah, sure, he chose
to zig when I zag, but...

21:38.732 --> 21:41.474
how many choices am I

21:41.517 --> 21:44.215
from going down the same road?KASIE:
I don't know,

21:44.259 --> 21:45.826
but the anticipation
is killing me.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.567
How many?

21:48.829 --> 21:50.526
Maybe we should just jump
into what I found?

21:50.570 --> 21:51.701
Yes, please.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.442
Yes. I wasn't able to figure out

21:53.486 --> 21:55.792
the combination
to Kohl's electronic lockbox,

21:55.836 --> 21:58.360
so I did it
the old-fashioned way.

22:00.014 --> 22:02.582
Ooh, destroying
sometimes feels good.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.018
What was inside?

22:04.061 --> 22:05.454
Oh, the reason that we were

22:05.498 --> 22:07.674
having trouble
tracking Kohl's assets:

22:07.717 --> 22:09.110
a cryptocurrency wallet.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.372
Were you able to access

22:10.416 --> 22:11.591
the blockchain ledger
of his purchases?

22:11.634 --> 22:12.679
I was.

22:12.722 --> 22:13.897
Torres, you still
with us?

22:13.941 --> 22:14.985
Yeah, I got it.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.378
Kohl paid for stuff

22:16.422 --> 22:17.727
with that thing, and you, uh...

22:18.989 --> 22:20.600
...were able to do something
with it.

22:20.643 --> 22:22.602
Trace it.
Yeah, that-that's close enough.

22:22.645 --> 22:24.125
So what'd Kohl buy?

22:24.168 --> 22:26.736
Guns, ammunition,
weapons.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.564
Hit man stuff, basically.

22:28.608 --> 22:29.957
See, man, I-I would have bought

22:30.000 --> 22:31.393
all that stuff.You would not

22:31.437 --> 22:32.525
have bought a haladie knife.

22:32.568 --> 22:34.701
I got two.

22:34.744 --> 22:36.180
Well, they're
collector's items, so...

22:36.224 --> 22:38.226
Wait, what is this huge
spike in purchases

22:38.269 --> 22:40.010
over the past month?

22:40.054 --> 22:41.838
Even more guns and ammo.
Kohl bought enough

22:41.882 --> 22:43.623
to outfit a small army.

22:43.666 --> 22:45.233
Why?

22:45.276 --> 22:46.974
Oh, I don't know.
But why don't you ask

22:47.017 --> 22:48.454
the guy who sold it to him?

22:49.542 --> 22:51.239
You got a name?Oh, well,

22:51.282 --> 22:52.893
when you're good, you're good.

22:52.936 --> 22:55.286
What I do is completely legal.

22:55.330 --> 22:56.853
I sell guns.

22:56.897 --> 22:59.726
Well, you sold guns
to a known killer.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.728
Kohl killed
20 people.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.556
Trust me, if you ever
got to meet him,

23:03.599 --> 23:05.514
I bet you'd be surprised.

23:05.558 --> 23:07.690
All things considered,
Kohl's a pretty good dude.

23:07.734 --> 23:10.693
Oh, so you think of him
as a friend?

23:10.737 --> 23:13.130
Absolutely.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.482
Well, your friend is dead, Rod.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.357
They got him.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.880
I can't
believe it.

23:23.924 --> 23:25.447
Who got him?

23:25.491 --> 23:28.145
You think they know who I am?

23:28.189 --> 23:29.669
Was it revenge?

23:29.712 --> 23:32.672
Do you think
they know who I am?

23:32.715 --> 23:35.718
Was Kohl murdered
because of someone he killed?

23:35.762 --> 23:38.634
I can't talk to you.

23:39.896 --> 23:42.421
The people he worked for
are monsters.

23:42.464 --> 23:45.728
Telling us what you know is
the only way we can protect you.

23:45.772 --> 23:47.382
Or...

23:47.426 --> 23:50.733
you can just
walk right out that door.

23:53.649 --> 23:56.609
Fine. I'll talk.

23:56.652 --> 24:00.090
But, for the record,
you guys got it all wrong.

24:00.134 --> 24:04.007
Kohl wasn't taken out
because of someone he killed...

24:04.051 --> 24:07.010
but because he refused to kill.

24:16.846 --> 24:19.980
So what kind of hit man
refuses to kill?

24:20.023 --> 24:22.548
It's not the kind of business
you just quit.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.637
Not without some
serious blowback.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.335
I'm guessing that's why Kohl
armed up and went on the run,

24:27.378 --> 24:28.597
not that he got very far.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.381
So who got to him?

24:30.425 --> 24:31.513
Well, the arms dealer thinks

24:31.557 --> 24:33.210
it was Kohl's mystery handler.

24:33.254 --> 24:34.560
Well, it makes sense.
Handler's the one

24:34.603 --> 24:36.083
that gets the jobs.

24:36.126 --> 24:38.389
If Kohl ever flipped,
handler goes down.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.696
Now we have NCIS and CIA
looking for the same person.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.306
Yeah, how we supposed
to track someone

24:42.350 --> 24:44.744
who's been hunted
by the CIA for months?

24:46.572 --> 24:48.487
Kohl's hit list.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.314
BISHOP:
What... I mean, it's a list

24:50.358 --> 24:52.403
of dead people.Yeah.

24:52.447 --> 24:54.623
Someone hired Kohl
for every victim on that list.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.364
Yeah, if we find
whoever ordered the hit,

24:56.407 --> 24:58.105
they can lead us to the handler.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.237
All we have to do is solve
one of these murders.

25:00.281 --> 25:03.284
Okay, so, I mean, which
victim do we start with?

25:03.327 --> 25:05.329
We've got a lot
to choose from.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.157
Her.Pippi Longstockings?

25:08.376 --> 25:09.420
We've already got a lead.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.771
The pawn shop owner's
girlfriend.

25:11.814 --> 25:13.163
Yeah, there was a witness

25:13.207 --> 25:14.338
who saw Jenny
fighting with someone

25:14.382 --> 25:15.775
the day before
she was killed.

25:15.818 --> 25:17.559
That someone could be the person
that hired that hit man.

25:17.603 --> 25:20.910
Come on, get that witness
in here, let's go.

25:22.738 --> 25:25.567
Knock, knock.
Agent Sloane

25:25.611 --> 25:27.787
Officer Clark

25:27.830 --> 25:29.528
from, uh... CIA.CIA. Uh-huh.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.312
Word gets around.

25:31.355 --> 25:33.401
Yeah, I'm sorry.It's okay.

25:33.444 --> 25:35.272
Mm, so...

25:35.316 --> 25:38.319
I hear that
our brain trust is

25:38.362 --> 25:40.364
making some progress
finding your handler.

25:40.408 --> 25:42.628
Yeah, they've, uh, they've
gotten more done in two days

25:42.671 --> 25:44.107
than we've done in two months.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.240
Yeah, they're good like that.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.808
Yeah. I took notice
when I read

25:48.851 --> 25:51.419
the after action report
on Nigel Hakim.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.029
You and
Director Vance

25:53.073 --> 25:54.857
had one hell of a summer.

25:54.901 --> 25:57.251
It was fine.

25:59.166 --> 26:01.472
Well, if fine is being captured
by Hakim's people,

26:01.516 --> 26:04.127
I would hate to hear about
one of your bad days.

26:04.171 --> 26:06.303
What can I help you with,
Officer Clark?

26:06.347 --> 26:07.609
Yeah, uh, can I sit?

26:07.653 --> 26:09.655
Please.I heard, uh,

26:09.698 --> 26:12.483
that you are quite
the profiler,

26:12.527 --> 26:15.617
and I am handling Kohl's
international cases,

26:15.661 --> 26:18.098
and I was hoping that maybe

26:18.141 --> 26:20.622
you could profile
some of the victims?

26:20.666 --> 26:23.059
Uh, to what end, exactly?

26:23.103 --> 26:25.627
In the hopes
of establishing a pattern.

26:25.671 --> 26:29.326
Uh, I... I could do that,

26:29.370 --> 26:31.807
but I don't know
how useful it would be.

26:31.851 --> 26:34.288
Kohl doesn't choose his victims,
they're chosen for him.

26:34.331 --> 26:36.290
Yeah, by the handler.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.292
Mm.And in establishing

26:38.335 --> 26:41.338
a pattern in those choices,
that could help us find him.

26:41.382 --> 26:44.515
Wait.

26:44.559 --> 26:47.736
You've been chasing
the handler for months.

26:47.780 --> 26:51.000
Hasn't the CIA already
run all of these profiles?

26:51.044 --> 26:52.306
Yeah, we have.

26:52.349 --> 26:55.744
But I also wanted
a-a fresh set of eyes.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.833
I see.

26:57.877 --> 27:00.357
So... we have a plan?

27:00.401 --> 27:03.752
Well...

27:03.796 --> 27:07.495
I do have one profile

27:07.538 --> 27:10.280
for you already.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.978
Well, that was fast.

27:12.021 --> 27:15.068
CIA Officer. About 45?

27:15.111 --> 27:17.592
Good-looking,
skilled at

27:17.636 --> 27:20.073
asking roundabout questions

27:20.116 --> 27:22.989
in order to dig up
unrelated information.

27:23.032 --> 27:25.731
And what information

27:25.774 --> 27:28.603
am I trying to dig up,
Agent Sloane?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.953
I have no idea.

27:30.997 --> 27:33.260
I just know that you're not
getting it from me.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.525
Mm. A hit man?

27:37.568 --> 27:39.701
Are you sure?

27:39.745 --> 27:41.529
Police reports said you
witnessed her fighting

27:41.572 --> 27:44.140
with someone the day before
she was killed.

27:44.184 --> 27:45.359
I did?

27:45.402 --> 27:48.318
Who can remember?

27:48.362 --> 27:50.103
Does that mean
you don't remember?

27:50.146 --> 27:51.713
Remember what?

27:51.757 --> 27:53.715
Nice place.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.152
Do you rent or own?

27:56.196 --> 27:59.503
It's a...
it's a federal building.

27:59.547 --> 28:03.420
Oh. Well, the orange
is a bit much.

28:03.464 --> 28:07.598
So we spoke to the detective
in charge of the case

28:07.642 --> 28:10.123
and he said that you knew
who killed Jenny.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.299
Yeah, then you changed
your story.

28:12.342 --> 28:13.779
I did?

28:15.128 --> 28:16.390
Who can remember?

28:16.433 --> 28:18.305
I think you can.

28:18.348 --> 28:20.481
You run a, uh...

28:20.524 --> 28:22.352
a six-figure sweater
knitting business

28:22.396 --> 28:23.876
out of your home.

28:23.919 --> 28:25.921
You've got
two employees.

28:25.965 --> 28:28.402
I bet your memory
works just fine.

28:28.445 --> 28:32.014
Look, sonny, I can't
talk to you, all right?

28:32.058 --> 28:33.886
Why is that?

28:33.929 --> 28:36.540
Because these people
are killers.

28:36.584 --> 28:38.499
Is that why you
changed your story?

28:38.542 --> 28:41.415
Well, hell yeah,
that's why I changed my story.

28:41.458 --> 28:44.505
I didn't work my butt off
all these years just to be 86'd

28:44.548 --> 28:46.420
two weeks before retirement.

28:46.463 --> 28:48.422
I got trips planned.

28:48.465 --> 28:49.728
We can protect you.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.686
Mm-hmm, until you can't.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.603
Miss Brown, if you don't
help us, more people could die.

28:55.646 --> 28:58.606
And this is my problem how?

28:58.649 --> 29:01.043
Because one of them
might be you.

29:01.087 --> 29:03.176
You said they're killers.

29:04.830 --> 29:08.094
Either work with us or...

29:08.137 --> 29:10.139
you're taking your chances.

29:13.490 --> 29:16.015
All right.
What do you want to know?

29:16.058 --> 29:17.625
Who was Jenny fighting with?

29:17.668 --> 29:19.627
His son, John.

29:19.670 --> 29:22.325
That's who hired your hit man.

29:22.369 --> 29:23.718
You sure?

29:23.762 --> 29:25.502
After I called
the cops,

29:25.546 --> 29:27.287
he came to my house

29:27.330 --> 29:28.462
and he said,

29:28.505 --> 29:29.942
"If you talk,

29:29.985 --> 29:32.161
I'm gonna have you killed, too."

29:32.205 --> 29:34.163
So, yeah...

29:34.207 --> 29:36.165
I'm sure.

29:36.209 --> 29:37.863
MCGEE:
So Johnny boy put out a hit

29:37.906 --> 29:39.473
on his dad's girlfriend?

29:39.516 --> 29:42.345
Then threatened to kill
a sweet little old lady...

29:42.389 --> 29:43.738
ish.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.566
Wow, and I thought
my family had issues.

29:45.609 --> 29:47.307
Should we
bring him in?

29:47.350 --> 29:48.830
Not unless we want him to walk.

29:48.874 --> 29:51.485
Well, everything we have
is circumstantial.

29:51.528 --> 29:52.878
Actually, I found something
that might stick.

29:52.921 --> 29:54.314
I was going through the son's
financial records...

29:54.357 --> 29:55.750
JIMMY:
It's, uh, this way, guys.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.622
Uh, follow me. I promise
it'll only take,

29:58.666 --> 30:00.320
like, two minutes of your time.

30:00.363 --> 30:02.452
Thank you so...

30:04.019 --> 30:06.630
You guys want to
go down to autopsy?

30:06.674 --> 30:08.067
I will meet you there.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.374
And, uh,
there's-there's candy corn

30:11.418 --> 30:12.549
for the first one there.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.422
I don't even
want to ask.

30:15.465 --> 30:16.902
I really don't want to answer.

30:16.945 --> 30:19.382
But if you make me,
I will tell you

30:19.426 --> 30:20.775
that there's absolutely no way

30:20.819 --> 30:22.342
that I heard something
whispering my name

30:22.385 --> 30:25.214
from an autopsy closet,
because... that is

30:25.258 --> 30:28.522
not possible, Gibbs, and those
two gentlemen with guns

30:28.565 --> 30:31.220
are gonna look inside
just to prove that.

30:36.138 --> 30:38.010
Well, anyway,
I was going through

30:38.053 --> 30:40.142
the son's financial
records and found

30:40.186 --> 30:41.622
an overseas account.

30:41.665 --> 30:43.102
Every week, over the
past three years,

30:43.145 --> 30:44.668
he wires a cash deposit

30:44.712 --> 30:46.018
for $9,500.

30:46.061 --> 30:48.716
Mm, just under the IRS
reporting requirements.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.849
Where's the money coming from?Well, it looks like
the pawn shop.

30:50.892 --> 30:53.155
Every week, there's a withdrawal
for that same amount.

30:55.897 --> 30:58.813
So what kind of pawn shop
generates that much business?

30:58.857 --> 31:01.642
One that's laundering money.

31:01.685 --> 31:04.471
Laundering money?
Are you kidding?

31:04.514 --> 31:06.690
Does this look like
my kidding face?

31:06.734 --> 31:09.084
No, it looks like your
"I'm totally wrong" face.

31:09.128 --> 31:10.346
All right,
so what happened?

31:10.390 --> 31:12.261
You and Jenny had
a fight over money?

31:12.305 --> 31:14.437
NCIS really likes
wasting people's time.

31:14.481 --> 31:17.440
She confronted you...This is ridiculous.

31:17.484 --> 31:19.138
...so you had her killed.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.661
This is a joke, right

31:20.704 --> 31:23.490
How's he doing?

31:23.533 --> 31:27.015
Well, we've got him dead
on the money laundering.

31:27.059 --> 31:28.669
Torres just needs to get him

31:28.712 --> 31:30.627
to admit to hiring Kohl.

31:30.671 --> 31:31.846
I have to say,
Director Vance,

31:31.890 --> 31:33.065
I'm very impressed
with your team.

31:33.108 --> 31:36.242
This is
exceptional work.

31:36.285 --> 31:38.113
We still don't
have the handler.

31:38.157 --> 31:41.595
Jack, have you met
CIA Officer Westley Clark?

31:41.638 --> 31:43.118
He's assisting
NCIS with the case.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.599
We met.

31:45.642 --> 31:47.688
ZAPROWSKI:
You know what? I'm done here.

31:47.731 --> 31:48.645
I want my lawyer.

31:49.995 --> 31:52.388
Have a seat.

31:52.432 --> 31:54.913
Sit down!

31:58.873 --> 32:00.657
Getting that lawyer
might be a good idea.

32:00.701 --> 32:02.659
Should get one for
your old man, too.

32:02.703 --> 32:05.184
For what?
He didn't do anything.

32:05.227 --> 32:06.750
He owns the pawn shop.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.187
This has nothing to do with him.

32:08.230 --> 32:09.753
See you.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.973
Ju... Wait!

32:12.017 --> 32:13.888
Just...

32:13.932 --> 32:15.716
wait.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.241
Okay?

32:19.285 --> 32:21.983
You got to leave my dad
out of this.

32:22.027 --> 32:23.680
He doesn't know about any of it.

32:23.724 --> 32:25.160
Define "any."

32:25.204 --> 32:28.859
He didn't know what I was doing.

32:28.903 --> 32:30.861
But Jenny found out.

32:30.905 --> 32:32.733
I tried talking
with her at first,

32:32.776 --> 32:35.170
but she wouldn't listen.

32:35.214 --> 32:38.043
Threatened to go to the police.

32:38.086 --> 32:41.263
So I called a number
I'd been given.

32:41.307 --> 32:44.745
I was told
it'd be taken care of.

32:45.920 --> 32:49.402
I had no idea
they were gonna kill her.

32:49.445 --> 32:51.621
Don't need a number.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.841
I need a name.

32:55.625 --> 32:56.670
McGEE:
Ms. Brentwood.

32:56.713 --> 32:59.673
NCIS..

33:01.805 --> 33:03.633
Hands where we can see them.

33:03.677 --> 33:07.333
Please. I didn't survive
the streets of Hell's Kitchen

33:07.376 --> 33:09.857
just to let a couple of feds
get the drop on me.

33:09.900 --> 33:12.164
If I were gonna shoot you,
it would've happened already.

33:12.207 --> 33:15.341
Put the cup down.
Put your hands in the air.

33:15.384 --> 33:17.691
You should know
I didn't want to terminate Kohl.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.954
I quite liked the man.

33:21.869 --> 33:23.784
You sort of remind me
of him, actually.

33:25.829 --> 33:27.744
But he refused a hit,
said he wouldn't kill military,

33:27.788 --> 33:31.574
and I couldn't have that, so...

33:31.618 --> 33:33.620
Kohl had to go.I said put your hands
in the air.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.796
Or what?
You'll kill me?

33:35.839 --> 33:38.538
One of my hit lists is in
the hands of a federal agency.

33:38.581 --> 33:39.800
I'm already dead.

33:39.843 --> 33:42.150
Who did Kohl refuse to kill?

33:44.718 --> 33:46.633
Who's the target?You'll know soon enough.

33:46.676 --> 33:47.851
A deal is a deal,

33:47.895 --> 33:48.809
even if I'm not around

33:48.852 --> 33:50.724
to receive my payment.

34:09.264 --> 34:10.570
GIBBS:
Give me a sitrep.

34:10.613 --> 34:11.919
Jimmy's bringing in the body
and McGee's downstairs

34:11.962 --> 34:15.314
with Kasie trying to crack
Brentwood's cell phone.

34:15.357 --> 34:18.099
Got any leads on the target?

34:18.143 --> 34:19.318
We turned her place
upside down--

34:19.361 --> 34:20.536
nothing.

34:20.580 --> 34:21.581
Uh, well, Kasie just sent
something up.

34:21.624 --> 34:23.887
She must've gotten
into the cell.

34:23.931 --> 34:24.932
It's another
list of names.

34:24.975 --> 34:26.455
Could it be
another hit list?

34:26.499 --> 34:27.978
For who?

34:28.022 --> 34:29.371
Another hit man.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.765
Wait, Gibbs,
check out the date

34:31.808 --> 34:32.896
on the top of the list.

34:34.028 --> 34:35.769
If that's a hit order,

34:35.812 --> 34:36.900
it just went out today.

34:36.944 --> 34:39.642
Navy Lieutenant Connor Reese.

34:39.686 --> 34:40.904
Where is he?Um...

34:40.948 --> 34:42.210
He owns a house in Alexandria.

34:42.254 --> 34:43.385
I'm calling now.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.474
No, Bishop, go. I got it.

34:53.047 --> 34:55.354
The hit order--
who did Brentwood send it to?

34:55.397 --> 34:57.007
A burner cell.

34:57.051 --> 34:58.270
And whoever owns it
disabled the GPS.

34:58.313 --> 35:00.010
Or they thought they did.

35:00.054 --> 35:01.664
These days, privacy has
gone the way of the dodo.

35:01.708 --> 35:04.624
Turns out, he visited a website
that installed a cookie

35:04.667 --> 35:06.887
which uploads his
location every...Yeah, I got it.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.802
Where?Well, the cell signal

35:08.845 --> 35:10.108
bounces around the D.C. area

35:10.151 --> 35:11.587
during the day,
but at night,

35:11.631 --> 35:13.633
comes back to
the same place.

35:13.676 --> 35:15.896
A rental property in Georgetown.
Care to guess the owner?

35:15.939 --> 35:18.028
Rachel Brentwood.She leased it to a guy

35:18.072 --> 35:21.075
named... wait for it,
wait for it.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.860
Got it. Adam Neil, 38.

35:25.906 --> 35:27.168
Boss, he was at the crime scene.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.605
He was asking a
ton of questions.

35:29.649 --> 35:30.824
Probably trying
to gauge his exposure.

35:30.867 --> 35:31.868
Where's the phone now?

35:33.783 --> 35:34.958
Uh, it's a parking garage in...

35:35.002 --> 35:37.874
Alexandria.

35:37.918 --> 35:39.963
I still don't understand
how you do that.

35:43.010 --> 35:46.796
Daily observation 15:
I really do love this new job.

35:46.840 --> 35:50.365
Lieutenant Reese. NCIS.

35:57.067 --> 35:59.026
It's unlocked.

35:59.069 --> 36:00.767
Was Gibbs not clear enough

36:00.810 --> 36:02.899
that there was a hit man
trying to kill this dude?

36:02.943 --> 36:04.162
Crystal.

36:11.038 --> 36:13.562
Clear.

36:18.654 --> 36:19.873
Gonna open?Uh-huh.

36:19.916 --> 36:22.397
Go.

36:24.443 --> 36:26.053
Don't kill me!

36:27.228 --> 36:29.883
Didn't you hear us say NCIS?

36:29.926 --> 36:33.234
Yeah. But I didn't believe it.

36:39.066 --> 36:40.850
Adam Neil!

36:40.894 --> 36:43.766
Get out of the car.

36:52.819 --> 36:54.168
He left his phone.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.084
Got the trunk.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.958
Took his weapon.

37:02.002 --> 37:03.786
Call Bishop and Torres.

37:03.830 --> 37:06.136
Where are we going?Back to NCIS.

37:06.180 --> 37:07.529
I can't believe someone
wants to kill me.

37:08.835 --> 37:10.706
Hold on, hold on.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.407
Get down!

37:16.321 --> 37:17.974
Ellie! Basement.

37:18.018 --> 37:19.585
What? Nick,
I'm not leaving you.

37:19.628 --> 37:22.022
I'm hit, bad.
Take him. Take Reese.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.582
Freeze!

38:00.626 --> 38:02.454
I actually
didn't get hit.

38:02.497 --> 38:04.456
And I didn't actually
go to the basement.

38:06.371 --> 38:07.981
You know, it's this code
that we worked out.

38:08.024 --> 38:10.113
If, uh, one of us
uses first names,

38:10.157 --> 38:12.290
the other one fakes a retreat,
and then doubles back.

38:13.769 --> 38:14.944
That was a good job, babe.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.729
Don't call me babe.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.774
Babe?Mm.

38:19.775 --> 38:22.256
Babe.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.479
Agent Gibbs is interrogating
the suspect now,

38:27.522 --> 38:30.046
but we believe he's responsible

38:30.090 --> 38:33.528
for the deaths of Petty Officer
Buckley and Anderson Kohl.

38:33.572 --> 38:37.140
Do we know why Lieutenant Reese
had a hit put out on him?

38:37.184 --> 38:40.361
Well, he was serving on the jury
in a drug trafficking case.

38:40.405 --> 38:43.233
Which has now turned into
an attempted murder case.

38:43.277 --> 38:45.148
Well, excellent work,
everyone, all around.

38:45.192 --> 38:47.150
VANCE:
Well,

38:47.194 --> 38:49.370
then I guess this
is bon voyage, Officer Clark.

38:49.414 --> 38:51.633
I guess it is.
It's been a real pleasure.

38:51.677 --> 38:54.027
I can't thank
NCIS enough.

38:54.070 --> 38:56.377
And when I get promoted
for this, drinks are on me.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.510
All right, we're gonna
hold you to that.

38:58.553 --> 39:00.381
Here, I'll walk you out.Bye-bye.

39:00.425 --> 39:01.948
Leon.Hmm?

39:01.991 --> 39:03.863
Be careful with this guy, okay?

39:03.906 --> 39:05.430
Well, you don't
have to tell me that.

39:05.473 --> 39:07.388
He's been
so far up my butt this week

39:07.432 --> 39:09.521
I almost started
charging him rent.

39:12.132 --> 39:13.089
SLOANE:
Hey.

39:13.133 --> 39:14.177
Whoa, Jimmy,

39:14.221 --> 39:15.222
you okay?

39:15.265 --> 39:17.355
No. I, um,

39:17.398 --> 39:20.619
I just requested
a temporary leave.

39:20.662 --> 39:23.535
What?It's just everything
down in autopsy.

39:23.578 --> 39:26.102
I mean, the bodies
moving around, the voices.

39:26.146 --> 39:27.495
I can't do it
anymore, you guys.

39:28.844 --> 39:31.020
Hey, Jimmy, just-just calm down.

39:31.064 --> 39:32.239
There's only
one explanation for this.

39:32.282 --> 39:33.675
I...

39:33.719 --> 39:35.111
am losing my mind.

39:35.155 --> 39:37.070
It is classic
schizophrenia.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.377
The symptoms are dead-on.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.074
Okay, McGee,
you have to tell him.

39:41.117 --> 39:43.772
Tell him what, McGee?

39:43.816 --> 39:47.080
You're not crazy.
It... it was me.

39:47.123 --> 39:49.212
You're just saying that, pal.

39:49.256 --> 39:51.693
I-I looked through
all of the security footage.

39:51.737 --> 39:54.261
All right?
And no one set foot inside.

39:54.304 --> 39:56.481
Come here, take a look at this.

40:02.878 --> 40:04.837
After I moved the body,

40:04.880 --> 40:06.839
I doctored the security tapes.

40:06.882 --> 40:08.623
Nice.

40:11.147 --> 40:13.715
Why would you do that?

40:13.759 --> 40:15.195
Well, it was Ducky's idea.

40:15.238 --> 40:17.110
He suggested I do, like,
a holiday surprise

40:17.153 --> 40:18.416
for you while he's gone.

40:18.459 --> 40:20.156
He was probably
thinking, like,

40:20.200 --> 40:22.028
orange cupcakes or pumpkins.

40:22.071 --> 40:23.943
Everyone loves pumpkins, McGee!

40:23.986 --> 40:26.293
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't know
you'd react like this.

40:26.336 --> 40:28.730
I apologize. Let me make it up
to you, all right?

40:28.774 --> 40:30.297
I'll buy you a beer
or something.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.477
No, I think we're even.

40:39.001 --> 40:41.221
On second thought...

40:41.264 --> 40:45.617
almost even, Agent McGee.

40:48.663 --> 40:51.057
TORRES:
Hey, yo.

40:51.100 --> 40:53.276
I got your voice mail.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.322
What up?

40:56.410 --> 40:57.977
You feeling okay?

40:58.020 --> 41:00.066
Well... been a while

41:00.109 --> 41:01.589
since I've taken a dive
like that.

41:01.633 --> 41:03.243
My back is a little sore.

41:03.286 --> 41:04.984
Nothing a little gin

41:05.027 --> 41:07.203
and ibuprofen couldn't fix.

41:07.247 --> 41:10.380
Wasn't talking about the pain.

41:12.295 --> 41:14.254
Oh, wow.

41:14.297 --> 41:15.777
McGee?

41:15.821 --> 41:16.952
Yeah.

41:16.996 --> 41:18.998
And Bishop and Jack.

41:20.260 --> 41:22.480
It's just because they care.

41:26.788 --> 41:30.400
Look, no disrespect...

41:30.444 --> 41:32.620
I'm just not sure
you know what it's like

41:32.664 --> 41:35.014
to look in the mirror
and, uh...

41:38.583 --> 41:40.410
...and see a killer.

41:42.674 --> 41:44.632
Actually...

41:44.676 --> 41:47.200
maybe you do.

41:49.028 --> 41:52.379
There's an ocean
between you and Kohl.

41:52.422 --> 41:55.208
I'd say more like a creek.

41:55.251 --> 41:59.125
Had the same training, the
same hobbies, same tastes.

42:01.040 --> 42:03.303
What if I slip up?

42:03.346 --> 42:05.566
It's about choices, Torres.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.220
You've made yours.

42:07.263 --> 42:09.309
And what choice is that?

42:09.352 --> 42:13.008
You chose the life
where you catch the bad guys.

42:13.052 --> 42:15.576
He picked the one

42:15.620 --> 42:17.796
where you kill them.

42:17.839 --> 42:19.841
For money.

42:21.321 --> 42:24.019
Then why doesn't that
make me feel better?

42:24.063 --> 42:27.545
Because you're a good guy,
and this is a dirty business.

42:27.588 --> 42:29.938
And if you didn't feel that way,

42:29.982 --> 42:31.984
then I'd start
to worry about you.
