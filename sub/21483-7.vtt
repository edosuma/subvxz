WEBVTT

00:01.730 --> 00:02.461
KEVIN: This is nice.

00:02.581 --> 00:03.499
Brother lunch.

00:03.501 --> 00:05.099
TACO: So, uh, how's Jenny doing?

00:05.101 --> 00:08.103
Oh, you know she's...
Ah, it was a rhetorical question.

00:08.105 --> 00:11.703
Okay. Well, since we're he, there's
something I want to talk to you about.

00:11.705 --> 00:14.574
You have to start setting a
lineup every single week.

00:14.576 --> 00:15.908
I don't already do that?

00:15.910 --> 00:16.609
No, you don't.

00:16.611 --> 00:18.344
People are starting to
question your loyalty.

00:18.346 --> 00:18.778
Okay.

00:18.780 --> 00:21.747
I mean, what are you doing all
day long, you can't take

00:21.749 --> 00:23.016
five minutes to set a lineup?

00:23.018 --> 00:24.885
What aren't you doing that you're not?

00:24.887 --> 00:26.253
So another rhetorical question?

00:26.255 --> 00:27.020
No. I want specifics.

00:27.022 --> 00:28.388
What do you do with your time?

00:28.390 --> 00:29.856
Your aimlessness fascinates me.

00:29.858 --> 00:32.357
Well, I'm not sitting around
eating a beef bucket.

00:32.359 --> 00:36.293
Well, this beef bucket is actually
research for work that I'm doing.

00:36.295 --> 00:39.094
Yobagoya's having a jingle
competition, and if I win it,

00:39.096 --> 00:41.630
I get Yobagoya for life.

00:41.632 --> 00:44.698
A lifetime to be brutally
cut short by colon cancer.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.599
Well, you used to eat it all the time.

00:46.601 --> 00:48.300
4:00 in the morning, really drunk?

00:48.302 --> 00:49.301
Those were shame meals.

00:49.303 --> 00:51.435
I mean, does that even
taste good to you?

00:51.437 --> 00:53.971
It's not about what it
tastes like, my friend.

00:53.973 --> 00:55.607
$2.99 for a bucket of beef.

00:55.609 --> 00:58.476
Taco, you can't buy a
bucket of nails for $2.99.

00:58.478 --> 01:00.479
ANDRE: Table for three?

01:00.481 --> 01:03.282
No, no, this is a brother's lunch.

01:03.284 --> 01:04.316
What's up, my brother?

01:04.318 --> 01:05.150
(laughs)

01:05.152 --> 01:06.618
Wow, what is that?

01:06.620 --> 01:10.590
Oh, this is something I made
from something I found.

01:10.592 --> 01:11.824
Okay, you can go now.

01:11.826 --> 01:13.226
I'm an urban forager.

01:13.228 --> 01:14.260
It's no big deal.

01:14.262 --> 01:15.928
Actually, it's a huge deal.

01:15.930 --> 01:18.465
Urban foraging is the new way to eat.

01:18.467 --> 01:21.300
The best most adventurous local
eating can be found by just

01:21.302 --> 01:22.768
putting on your Wellies
and going foraging.

01:22.770 --> 01:24.236
How do you have time for this?

01:24.238 --> 01:25.003
Doesn't anybody work?

01:25.005 --> 01:28.606
Weeds and fruit that you would never
think to eat are actually delicacies.

01:28.608 --> 01:30.608
Even clams and snails.

01:30.610 --> 01:31.608
Urban nails?

01:31.610 --> 01:32.409
Oh, yeah.

01:32.411 --> 01:34.777
Slugs? It's disgusting.

01:34.779 --> 01:35.979
Hold that thought.

01:35.981 --> 01:36.947
What?

01:36.949 --> 01:38.116
Mustard greens.

01:38.118 --> 01:38.916
Do you see that?

01:38.918 --> 01:39.283
No.

01:39.285 --> 01:40.484
There are mustard greens here.

01:40.486 --> 01:41.452
What are you doing?

01:41.454 --> 01:42.086
This is great!

01:42.088 --> 01:42.920
Don't go in there.

01:42.922 --> 01:43.687
That's tras... Andre?

01:43.689 --> 01:44.488
What are you...?

01:44.490 --> 01:46.123
Oh, guys, there's so much here.

01:46.125 --> 01:47.124
You want some of this?

01:47.126 --> 01:47.691
No!

01:47.693 --> 01:49.294
Do not put that in your mouth.

01:49.296 --> 01:50.528
That is disgusting.

01:50.530 --> 01:54.432
Mushroom caps and...
Oh, no, that's a condom.

01:54.552 --> 01:59.284

02:00.769 --> 02:02.252
All right, so what are
we working on here now?

02:02.359 --> 02:04.325
We got the cheap Mexican
paint cans exploding.

02:04.327 --> 02:06.232
RUXIN: Allegedly.

02:06.352 --> 02:10.808
Drug companies, erectile dysfunction
medication causes brain lesions.

02:10.928 --> 02:13.299
Well, I know firsthand that that's false.

02:13.301 --> 02:16.369
We got a class-action lawsuit
against the YobagoYoya food chain

02:16.371 --> 02:19.915
for negligent food handling
that's making people sick.

02:20.035 --> 02:22.809
It's not the handling,
it's the food itself.

02:27.649 --> 02:29.283
What'd you say?

02:29.285 --> 02:32.787
I said it's the...
Say it! Say it.

02:32.789 --> 02:36.124
It's the food, not the food
handling that's unsanitary.

02:36.126 --> 02:37.725
It's a bunch of horse meat.

02:37.727 --> 02:40.227
North Koreans wouldn't even eat it.

02:40.229 --> 02:42.963
Ah! (chuckles)

02:42.965 --> 02:44.931
What a great defense!

02:44.933 --> 02:48.301
Yeah, if you're gonna pay
$2.99 for three pounds of

02:48.303 --> 02:52.071
horse meat, there's a reasonable expectation
that your colon's gonna implode.

02:52.073 --> 02:53.239
That's good.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.139
What's your name?

02:54.141 --> 02:55.073
Ruxin, sir.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.275
No, it's not.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.277
Well, it's "Rodney," but
everybody calls me Ruxin.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.612
Skippy. You're Skippy.

02:59.614 --> 03:00.746
Whatever you want.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.816
You and I, we're gonna be
working on this one together.

03:03.818 --> 03:04.917
All right!

03:04.919 --> 03:07.153
(laughs) Nice!

03:07.155 --> 03:08.654
I look forward to it.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.623
Should I come by your office, Mr.
Hudabega?

03:10.625 --> 03:13.159
Slow down.

03:13.161 --> 03:15.395
Hey, can I check your
computer real quick?

03:15.397 --> 03:18.331
I just want to mess with my lineup a
little bit, make a few adjustments before

03:18.333 --> 03:18.831
the game starts.

03:18.833 --> 03:21.934
JENNY: Tinker away, Tinkerbell,
straight to Never-Never Win Land.

03:21.936 --> 03:23.236
Will do, Captain Hooker.

03:23.238 --> 03:24.070
(sneezes)

03:24.072 --> 03:24.670
Bless you.

03:24.672 --> 03:25.838
Are you sick?

03:25.840 --> 03:26.605
No.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.440
You sound sick.

03:27.442 --> 03:28.174
I'm not sick.

03:28.176 --> 03:30.576
Well, I just touched your
keyboard which you were just

03:30.578 --> 03:31.944
touching with your sick hands.

03:31.946 --> 03:32.678
I'm not sick.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.646
Why are you sneezing?

03:33.648 --> 03:34.680
I have allergies.

03:34.682 --> 03:35.748
What are you allergic to?

03:35.750 --> 03:36.949
I don't know. Dust?

03:36.951 --> 03:38.984
That makes sense 'cause
you have a filthy house.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.519
PETE: Did the game start yet?

03:40.521 --> 03:40.953
Nope.

03:40.955 --> 03:42.488
God, unbelievable.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.089
Traffic is insane.

03:44.091 --> 03:47.625
There's a traffic light out, and they
have one of those annoying cops directing

03:47.627 --> 03:49.194
traffic with the white gloves.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.362
Oh, I love the gloves.

03:50.364 --> 03:53.765
Who decided it was a good idea to replace
a traffic light with an asshole?

03:53.767 --> 03:54.799
Okay, easy does it.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.368
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.135
Anything complicated?

03:57.137 --> 03:58.436
No, I have to pee-pee.

03:58.438 --> 04:00.805
What are you, like, a
four-year-old gay kid?

04:00.807 --> 04:02.206
Okay, this is driving me nuts.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.976
Taco has not set his lineup again.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.011
Surprise!

04:06.013 --> 04:07.012
It's not acceptable, okay?

04:07.014 --> 04:09.447
It's absentee ownership,
and I don't like it.

04:09.449 --> 04:10.349
I think it's great.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.852
It's like we have a little
Furtado wild card in our league.

04:12.854 --> 04:13.886
I'm changing his lineup.

04:13.888 --> 04:14.887
You can't do that.

04:14.889 --> 04:15.688
That's illegal.

04:15.690 --> 04:16.956
He has three kickers;

04:16.958 --> 04:18.658
<i>that</i> is illegal.

04:18.660 --> 04:20.326
Let's see, his team name
password is "Taco."

04:20.327 --> 04:22.195
What do you think his password is?

04:22.197 --> 04:24.230
Uh, let me see that for a second.

04:24.232 --> 04:25.030
Hey! You know what?

04:25.032 --> 04:26.499
Give me, just give me the computer.

04:26.501 --> 04:28.134
No, I don't have to give it back.

04:28.136 --> 04:29.368
Are you covering for him?

04:29.370 --> 04:30.036
No! Relax!

04:30.038 --> 04:31.905
I know you're covering for him.

04:31.907 --> 04:34.508
Just relax.
You're in my house using my computer.

04:34.510 --> 04:36.843
Oh, Taco, this is a mess!

04:36.845 --> 04:40.047
Smallhandsonballs.net
is not up and running right now.

04:40.049 --> 04:41.182
That's not what I'm checking.

04:41.184 --> 04:42.183
Let me see it!

04:42.185 --> 04:43.251
Just let me see it!

04:43.253 --> 04:45.086
Okay, this, okay, looks good.

04:45.088 --> 04:46.822
Let me do what I need to do!

04:46.824 --> 04:47.990
Wow, look at this.

04:47.992 --> 04:50.092
It looks like Taco just set his lineup.

04:50.094 --> 04:51.661
What?

04:51.663 --> 04:52.428
What a coincidence.

04:52.430 --> 04:53.896
You got to be kidding me.

04:53.898 --> 04:54.730
It's all changed.

04:54.732 --> 04:57.266
This is full-on family collusion here.

04:57.268 --> 04:58.200
Just a coincidence.

04:58.202 --> 05:00.936
Oh, look at you, your little
shadow government colluding

05:00.938 --> 05:02.671
together behind closed doors.

05:02.673 --> 05:03.905
Let me tell you guys something.

05:03.907 --> 05:05.407
It will not stand.

05:05.409 --> 05:08.243
You were so busy trying to save
your brothers ass that you

05:08.245 --> 05:11.612
scurried in here without washing your
hands, you filthy filth monster.

05:11.614 --> 05:14.047
No, I didn't wash my
hands if you must know.

05:14.049 --> 05:16.417
I have...
ELLIE: You didn't wash your hands?!

05:16.419 --> 05:18.252
No, Ellie, I didn't wash my hands.

05:18.254 --> 05:20.087
You always tell me to wash my hands.

05:20.089 --> 05:22.657
Ellie, it is important for
you to wash your hands, but

05:22.659 --> 05:25.460
sometimes grownups don't have...
You still didn't wash your hands!

05:25.462 --> 05:26.461
Mom, we should ground him!

05:26.463 --> 05:28.130
We should totally ground him.

05:28.132 --> 05:28.630
Yeah!

05:28.632 --> 05:29.632
Daddy's been a bad boy.

05:29.634 --> 05:31.200
Yeah, Daddy should get spanked.

05:31.202 --> 05:34.437
Maybe you should get a strap-on...
Ah! Da-da-di!

05:34.439 --> 05:35.572
Ellie, go in the other room.

05:35.574 --> 05:36.439
Get some ice cream.

05:36.441 --> 05:38.207
There's ice cream in the other room.

05:38.209 --> 05:39.241
Strap-on?

05:39.243 --> 05:40.242
(sneezes)

05:40.244 --> 05:41.643
You <i>are</i> sick.

05:41.645 --> 05:44.446
Allergies. (coughs)

05:48.631 --> 05:49.566
What is this, <i>Night Court?</i>

05:49.686 --> 05:50.811
<i>Court is now in session.</i>

05:51.089 --> 05:52.789
<i>The Honorable Judge Ruxin presiding.</i>

05:52.791 --> 05:54.573
<i>It's the</i> <i>Chosen People's Court.</i>

05:54.693 --> 05:57.226
<i>Now, citizens of the League,
there is no greater threat</i>

05:57.228 --> 05:59.995
<i>to league integrity than
an uncommitted owner.</i>

05:59.997 --> 06:04.666
<i>Taco's lack of interest is a
black mark upon our league.</i>

06:04.668 --> 06:07.335
<i>He's still starting Kenny Britt
who's been injured for weeks.</i>

06:07.337 --> 06:11.172
<i>And while I have no respect for
individual members of this</i>

06:11.174 --> 06:12.573
<i>league... Ugh!</i>

06:12.575 --> 06:16.610
<i>...I have a tremendous amount of
respect for the League itself.</i>

06:16.612 --> 06:18.245
<i>This is bordering on sincerity.</i>

06:18.247 --> 06:23.049
<i>And as your league champion, I,
Rodney Ruxin, submit that</i>

06:23.051 --> 06:27.587
<i>if Taco does not start a lineup
with active NFL players, not</i>

06:27.589 --> 06:32.725
<i>NHL, CFL, WWE or Panthro from the
Thundercats, that he shall</i>

06:32.727 --> 06:35.028
<i>be kicked out of this league.</i>

06:35.030 --> 06:35.796
<i>What?</i>

06:35.798 --> 06:38.665
<i>I have spoken!
Taco is vital to the league.</i>

06:38.667 --> 06:39.633
<i>He's our heart.</i>

06:39.635 --> 06:41.302
<i>Yeah, and he's good for easy wins.</i>

06:41.304 --> 06:44.372
<i>All right, we got to
put a stop to this.</i>

06:44.374 --> 06:45.373
<i>Shadow government all in.</i>

06:45.375 --> 06:46.140
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

06:46.142 --> 06:46.974
<i>ALL: One, two, three.</i>

06:46.976 --> 06:48.209
<i>We were never here!</i>

06:48.211 --> 06:50.712
<i>I know you guys are planning
something so don't.</i>

06:50.714 --> 06:52.681
<i>Because I am watching you.</i>

06:52.683 --> 06:54.016
<i>What the...?</i>

06:54.018 --> 06:56.485
<i>(blowing whistle)</i>

06:59.189 --> 07:01.657
<i>Traffic light's out again.</i>

07:01.659 --> 07:03.792
<i>There he is, there's Glovesy.</i>

07:03.794 --> 07:04.893
<i>Who's Glovesy?</i>

07:04.895 --> 07:07.061
<i>The asshole under the traffic light.</i>

07:07.063 --> 07:07.862
<i>I kind of like him.</i>

07:07.864 --> 07:08.897
<i>He's got mad skills.</i>

07:08.899 --> 07:09.997
<i>Check out those gloves.</i>

07:09.999 --> 07:11.732
<i>Yeah, Michael Flatley's got mad skills.</i>

07:11.734 --> 07:13.667
<i>Doesn't mean I want to go
watch him dance, okay?</i>

07:13.669 --> 07:14.835
<i>Have you ever seen him dance?</i>

07:14.837 --> 07:17.237
<i>Andre... I got tickets...
Don't try to get me to see</i>

07:17.239 --> 07:17.971
<i>Michael Flatley again.</i>

07:17.973 --> 07:18.638
<i>Give it a chance.</i>

07:18.640 --> 07:23.377
<i>You-you never...
A field of dandelion greens.</i>

07:23.379 --> 07:24.812
<i>It's a bunch of weeds, Andre.</i>

07:24.814 --> 07:27.181
<i>Au contraire, mon frère.</i>

07:27.183 --> 07:28.517
<i>I got to check this out.</i>

07:28.519 --> 07:30.819
<i>Really?</i>

07:30.821 --> 07:31.653
<i>No foraging.</i>

07:31.655 --> 07:33.556
<i>Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.</i>

07:33.558 --> 07:34.490
<i>(horns honking)</i>

07:34.492 --> 07:36.693
<i>Andre, get in the car.</i>

07:36.695 --> 07:37.994
<i>Oh, now you want me to go.</i>

07:37.996 --> 07:40.130
<i>Well, I have to wait now 'cause
my moron friend is getting</i>

07:40.132 --> 07:41.232
<i>dandelion greens.</i>

07:41.234 --> 07:42.199
<i>Look at this.</i>

07:42.201 --> 07:42.867
<i>Look at these.</i>

07:42.869 --> 07:43.901
<i>(horn honking incessantly)</i>

07:43.903 --> 07:44.902
<i>Andre, come on, please.</i>

07:44.904 --> 07:46.337
<i>Andre, we have to get in the r.</i>

07:46.339 --> 07:48.072
<i>I know. One second, please.</i>

07:48.074 --> 07:50.408
<i>Andre, let's go.</i>

07:50.410 --> 07:53.377
<i>Use your words. Speak.</i>

07:53.379 --> 07:54.779
<i>(Andre laughs)</i>

07:54.781 --> 07:56.882
<i>So sorry. Sorry.</i>

07:56.884 --> 07:58.049
<i>Smell this.</i>

07:58.051 --> 07:58.917
<i>Smells like shit.</i>

07:58.919 --> 08:00.285
<i>You got to clean them, of course.</i>

08:00.287 --> 08:01.854
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

08:01.856 --> 08:03.522
<i>Oh, now we're going.</i>

08:03.524 --> 08:05.458
<i>Now we're going.</i>

08:05.460 --> 08:08.060
<i>Whatever.</i>

08:08.062 --> 08:10.930
<i>Now we've had a great open house
today, but I know when we</i>

08:10.932 --> 08:13.633
<i>look around the classroom, we
don't see all of our classmates</i>

08:13.635 --> 08:14.867
<i>or all of their parents.</i>

08:14.869 --> 08:16.602
<i>It's cold and flu season.</i>

08:16.604 --> 08:19.605
<i>That's why we've been talking
so much about germs and Germy.</i>

08:19.607 --> 08:21.908
<i>Remember, don't let
Germy stay with you.</i>

08:21.910 --> 08:26.145
<i>Now I hear that someone in here
has a parent who never ever</i>

08:26.147 --> 08:27.747
<i>washes their hands.</i>

08:27.749 --> 08:29.214
<i>Is that all right, children?</i>

08:29.216 --> 08:31.617
<i>No.</i>

08:38.691 --> 08:42.025
<i>Now I know it was Ellie that
told her about what happened</i>

08:42.028 --> 08:43.995
<i>here the other day, with me and
the hands and the washing and</i>

08:43.996 --> 08:45.163
<i>the Ruxin situation.</i>

08:45.165 --> 08:48.066
<i>So now Mrs.
Hobarth thinks that I'm a beast.</i>

08:48.068 --> 08:49.400
<i>I'm an animal.</i>

08:49.402 --> 08:50.902
<i>That I am the living Germy.</i>

08:50.904 --> 08:51.770
<i>Can we focus here?</i>

08:51.772 --> 08:53.572
<i>Trying to win a jingle competition.</i>

08:53.574 --> 08:54.239
<i>Oh, pardon me.</i>

<i>Oh, and your goddamn

<i>Oh, God, you people disgust me.</i>

09:41.822 --> 09:44.122
<i>You're all a bunch of filthy Germys.</i>

09:44.124 --> 09:46.458
<i>Oh, Ruxin, it looks like
you may be getting sick.</i>

09:46.460 --> 09:48.626

<i>I can't be sick around him.</i>

09:56.737 --> 09:58.003
<i>That's why I got a new suit.</i>

09:58.005 --> 09:59.204
<i>I got a haircut.</i>

09:59.206 --> 10:01.841
<i>And now... (sneezes)</i>

10:03.210 --> 10:05.378
<i>That's actually kind of refreshing.</i>

10:13.490 --> 10:17.259

10:17.261 --> 10:19.494
<i>Wood sorrel?</i>

10:19.496 --> 10:21.697
<i>By the highway?</i>

10:21.699 --> 10:24.599
<i>Yodel this.</i>

10:32.568 --> 10:34.313
So we got a new case.

10:34.433 --> 10:38.740
It's a mining company that's pumping
toxic sludge into a pristine wilderness.

10:38.742 --> 10:41.776
Or is it the local Amish community?

10:41.778 --> 10:44.402
Hey, Skippy, come here.

10:44.522 --> 10:45.210
Have a seat right here.

10:45.330 --> 10:47.013
No, I can...
You're working with me.

10:47.015 --> 10:48.148
Okay.

10:48.150 --> 10:50.350
(chuckles)

10:50.352 --> 10:52.752
(sneezes)

10:55.627 --> 10:57.228
Bless you?

10:57.230 --> 10:59.731
That wasn't a sneeze, sir.

10:59.733 --> 11:01.165
I hit my nose.

11:01.167 --> 11:02.500
You're sounding hoarse.

11:02.502 --> 11:04.035
I went to a concert last night.

11:04.037 --> 11:05.070
Who'd you see?

11:05.072 --> 11:06.839
Barry Manilow.

11:06.841 --> 11:08.207
You sure you're not sick?

11:08.209 --> 11:09.074
Yeah.

11:09.076 --> 11:12.278
'Cause if you're sick, I don't
want you sitting next to me.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.113
There's no crime in being sick.

11:14.115 --> 11:15.581
People get sick all the time.

11:15.583 --> 11:20.218
The crime is when people
don't admit they're sick.

11:20.220 --> 11:21.786
Yeah, I'm not sick.

11:21.788 --> 11:23.721
What is it?

11:23.723 --> 11:25.289
Allergies.

11:25.291 --> 11:26.090
Allergies?

11:26.092 --> 11:28.092
What kind of allergies do you have?

11:28.094 --> 11:29.794
Bees.

11:29.796 --> 11:31.929
I'm terribly allergic to bees.

11:31.931 --> 11:34.097
My brother's allergic to bees!

11:34.099 --> 11:35.065
That's unbelievable.

11:35.067 --> 11:35.733
Yeah.

11:35.735 --> 11:36.601
You and my brother.

11:36.603 --> 11:37.602
Did you get stung?

11:37.604 --> 11:38.736
No.

11:38.738 --> 11:42.274
No, there's probably just
a bee in here somewhere.

11:43.710 --> 11:45.144
Got him.

11:45.146 --> 11:46.279
Where were we?

11:46.281 --> 11:48.281
We're going to put those
Amish (bleep) in prison.

11:48.283 --> 11:50.650
Ah!

11:51.886 --> 11:55.655
The theme of tonight's meal is a
celebration of urban foraging.

11:55.657 --> 11:59.793
Everything at this table can be
found in this city for free.

11:59.795 --> 12:02.561
The turnips from just
across the highway.

12:02.563 --> 12:03.095
Look at this.

12:03.097 --> 12:03.996
I don't even think it's clean.

12:03.998 --> 12:04.663
Who's going to eat that?

12:04.665 --> 12:06.265
It doesn't need to be washed.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.066
Where's the food.

12:07.068 --> 12:08.266
This is the food.

12:08.268 --> 12:12.003
It's all local, organic and from
the streets in which we live.

12:12.005 --> 12:13.138
Grocery store is local.

12:13.140 --> 12:14.305
Why can't we forage there?

12:14.307 --> 12:15.406
No, that doesn't count.

12:15.408 --> 12:17.408
I'll go forage up a
pepperoni pizza right now.

12:17.410 --> 12:18.309
Cheese in the crust.

12:18.311 --> 12:19.277
I would love it.

12:19.279 --> 12:21.078
Can you just try some of the turnips?

12:21.080 --> 12:23.180
And I'm going to bring you back
something that I found under the

12:23.182 --> 12:25.749
El train that is going
to knock your socks off.

12:25.751 --> 12:27.418
Oh, God.

12:27.420 --> 12:28.352
Ugh.

12:28.354 --> 12:29.519
I'm not eating this crap.

12:29.521 --> 12:31.188
How many cocktails are
you having tonight?

12:31.190 --> 12:32.690
As many as I can get down my gullet.

12:32.692 --> 12:35.860
I can't believe I waited an
hour in traffic to eat snails.

12:35.862 --> 12:37.828
Why were you in traffic
for a whole hour?

12:37.830 --> 12:39.363
It's goddamn Glovesy okay?

12:39.365 --> 12:41.098
He's out there directing traffic.

12:41.100 --> 12:41.932
He's making it worse.

12:41.934 --> 12:44.335
May I present to you... Shit burgers?

12:44.337 --> 12:47.504
Hen-of-the-wood mushrooms
over a bed of arugula.

12:47.506 --> 12:51.007
They need no sort of seasoning
because they have their own kind

12:51.009 --> 12:53.276
of pungent aroma.

12:53.278 --> 12:57.681

All right, let me in here.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.627
We're having an urban foraging dinner.

13:09.629 --> 13:10.361
Delicious.

13:10.363 --> 13:11.996
This was all local and it was all free.

13:11.998 --> 13:12.864
Beautiful.

13:12.866 --> 13:13.798
It's not the same thing.

13:26.379 --> 13:28.746
So this is where the shadow
government meets, huh?

13:28.748 --> 13:30.715
You were not invited
because you're sick.

13:30.717 --> 13:33.285
Yeah, but I'm here to make
sure that Taco sets his own

13:33.287 --> 13:35.554
lineup, and none of you
guys do it for him.

13:35.556 --> 13:36.555
I already set my lineup.

13:36.557 --> 13:39.991
No, you just changed your profile
picture to a horse having sex.

13:39.993 --> 13:42.527
Correction-- that was a pony
having sex with a human.

13:42.529 --> 13:44.596
Who's human? Andre?

13:44.598 --> 13:46.197
Fives.

13:46.199 --> 13:47.566
Come on, five?

13:47.568 --> 13:49.668
No, no, why would I high-five that?

13:49.670 --> 13:50.969
You don't have to do that, Taco.

13:50.971 --> 13:52.337
No, it's okay.

13:52.339 --> 13:53.939
I think I can set my lines up.

13:53.941 --> 13:59.011
Look, it needs to be accurate or
you, my friend, are getting fad.

13:59.013 --> 14:02.047
All right, you new password is in...
Hey.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.415
You changed his password.

14:03.417 --> 14:06.384
Yeah, so that none of you bozos
could do any funny business.

14:06.386 --> 14:08.052
Miss Wanna Be... Okay.

14:08.054 --> 14:08.886
Where are the bye weeks?

14:08.888 --> 14:09.720
Ah!

14:09.722 --> 14:11.522
You don't say a word, nothing
about any bye weeks.

14:11.524 --> 14:12.356
No helping him.

14:12.358 --> 14:14.858
If he plays anyone who
is not a bye, he is out.

14:14.860 --> 14:15.726
I know how it works.

14:15.728 --> 14:17.627
Take the bye players out,
put in straight ones.

14:17.629 --> 14:18.462
Ah.

14:18.464 --> 14:19.296
Bi-players?

14:19.298 --> 14:20.130
Right.

14:20.132 --> 14:22.232
What, is, uh, is Andre in
the league all of a sudden?

14:22.234 --> 14:23.066
Come on, fives, man.

14:23.068 --> 14:23.900
No.

14:23.902 --> 14:24.768
I'm not high-fiving that.

14:24.770 --> 14:25.601
Give me fives, bro.

14:25.603 --> 14:26.436
Okay.

14:26.438 --> 14:27.604
So I'll just set my lineup.

14:27.606 --> 14:28.438
Mm-hmm.

14:28.440 --> 14:31.107
Just... Uh, oh, I think I
did something wrong, here.

14:31.109 --> 14:32.776
What are you... Why are you in History?

14:32.778 --> 14:33.610
I don't know.

14:33.612 --> 14:35.412
I don't know how to get out of here.

14:35.414 --> 14:36.480
It's okay, you'll get there.

14:36.482 --> 14:37.314
Uh... oh.

14:37.316 --> 14:38.149
What's this?

14:38.151 --> 14:39.383
Forag-acation.

14:39.385 --> 14:40.217
Whoa!

14:40.219 --> 14:41.118
Wow.

14:41.120 --> 14:41.953
21st century stage.

14:41.955 --> 14:44.489
This is not...
I don't know how that got here.

14:44.491 --> 14:45.456
I-I swear, it just came up.

14:45.458 --> 14:47.225
I was Googling, and it just...
I didn't know.

14:47.227 --> 14:49.328
Is that why we're in the "Members" ea?

14:49.330 --> 14:51.330
What, uh, was Sierra Chap blocked?

14:51.332 --> 14:52.164
(laughs)

14:52.166 --> 14:52.998
Fives.

14:53.000 --> 14:53.832
Oh, come on, man.

14:53.834 --> 14:54.666
Too far.

14:54.668 --> 14:55.500
Here we go.

14:55.502 --> 14:56.334
Let's do this.

14:56.336 --> 14:57.335
You know what you're doing.

14:57.337 --> 14:58.169
Come on.

14:58.171 --> 14:59.003
Okay.

14:59.005 --> 14:59.837
The top part is empty.

14:59.839 --> 15:01.572
So I need to put a kicker there.

15:01.574 --> 15:02.774
No.

15:02.776 --> 15:06.910
I do not need to put a kicker there,
I need to put a quarterback in.

15:06.912 --> 15:07.778
Yeah.

15:07.780 --> 15:12.683
That would be... So...
I will just put in... G. Jennings.

15:12.685 --> 15:13.617
(others gasp)

15:13.619 --> 15:17.321
No, I won't put Jennings in,
'cause I'll go lower, and I

15:17.323 --> 15:22.027
think that I will maybe put Br...
Cam... Cam?

15:22.029 --> 15:23.129
Came Newtown?

15:23.131 --> 15:24.964
Cam Newton, in.

15:24.966 --> 15:25.798
There we go.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.301
And next...
What are you doing back there, man?

15:28.303 --> 15:30.604
Oh, I... the Yobagoya stinks,
man, I can't sit by that.

15:30.606 --> 15:32.807
All right, I also need a RB.

15:32.809 --> 15:34.308
Runner.

15:34.310 --> 15:35.375
Run... running back.

15:35.377 --> 15:36.209
Okay.

15:36.211 --> 15:38.011
Oh, I'll just put Charles.

15:38.013 --> 15:41.380
R. Charles... I...
You don't want to... Why?

15:41.382 --> 15:42.314
Shut it.

15:42.316 --> 15:49.521
Because his knee... I'll just go up, to this...
blow j... B. J...

15:49.523 --> 15:51.022
Brandon Jacobs.

15:51.024 --> 15:52.123
Oh!

15:52.125 --> 15:53.024
I'll do that.

15:53.026 --> 15:54.359
And put him in.

15:54.361 --> 15:55.393
There we go.

15:55.395 --> 15:57.629
Submit.

15:57.631 --> 15:58.697
Oh ho ho ho!

15:58.699 --> 15:59.998
Oh, man, that was easy.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.333
I'm gonna do this more often.

16:03.786 --> 16:04.820
(whistle blows)

16:04.822 --> 16:06.354
Geez.

16:06.356 --> 16:08.069
All right, Glovesy.

16:08.189 --> 16:09.054
Looking good, buddy.

16:09.056 --> 16:09.888
(whistle blows sharply)

16:09.890 --> 16:10.756
Do your little dance.

16:10.758 --> 16:11.723
You're right, let me through.

16:11.725 --> 16:14.359
You're gonna, you're
just gonna stop me?

16:14.361 --> 16:16.595
All right, come on,
Glovesy, give me my turn.

16:16.597 --> 16:18.097
Hey, it's my turn, Glovesy!

16:18.099 --> 16:18.931
(honks horn)

16:18.933 --> 16:21.400
Hey, come on!

16:21.402 --> 16:22.268
Hey!

16:22.270 --> 16:23.736
(honks horn)

16:23.738 --> 16:25.404
Oh, you want to make this personal?

16:25.406 --> 16:26.405
Oh, okay.

16:26.407 --> 16:27.440
All right.

16:27.442 --> 16:31.610
I see how we're going to do this.

16:31.612 --> 16:32.578
Hey.

16:32.580 --> 16:34.313
You're not giving equal
attention to all t lanes.

16:34.315 --> 16:35.214
Sir, get back in your car.

16:35.216 --> 16:36.048
(car hns honking)

16:36.050 --> 16:36.882
Oh, it speaks!

16:36.884 --> 16:37.716
Look at this!

16:37.718 --> 16:38.551
Yes, it speaks.

16:38.553 --> 16:39.385
I'll tell you what.

16:39.387 --> 16:40.219
Glovesy.

16:40.221 --> 16:41.053
Glovesy?

16:41.055 --> 16:41.887
Glovesy, yeah.

16:41.889 --> 16:42.755
You just called me Glovesy?

16:42.757 --> 16:43.588
That's your name.

16:43.590 --> 16:44.422
No, it's not my name.

16:44.424 --> 16:45.257
We all call you Glovesy.

16:45.259 --> 16:45.890
Everybody.

16:45.892 --> 16:46.725
My name's Horace.

16:46.727 --> 16:49.627
Hey, Horace... you're not special just
'cause you got some garden gloves and a

16:49.629 --> 16:50.428
little coach whistle, okay?

16:50.430 --> 16:51.896
These are traffic gloves... Oh.

16:51.898 --> 16:52.764
This is a traffic whistle.

16:52.766 --> 16:53.598
Take the gloves off, sir.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.266
These are traffic gloves, too!

16:55.268 --> 16:56.934
I can direct a little
bit of traffic, too.

16:56.936 --> 16:57.935
Let's direct some this way.

16:57.937 --> 16:58.936
No, no-no-no-no.

16:58.938 --> 16:59.837
Sir, get back in your car.

16:59.839 --> 17:02.072
I think we can just take
these gloves, and I'll just

17:02.074 --> 17:03.740
direct it right... right up in there!

17:03.742 --> 17:04.575
No!

17:04.577 --> 17:06.310
No, it's going to go out of there.

17:06.311 --> 17:07.243
No, it's going in there.

17:07.246 --> 17:08.079
It's out of there.

17:08.080 --> 17:09.012
I'll put it in your mouth.

17:09.015 --> 17:09.847
It's out of my mouth.

17:09.848 --> 17:10.848
I'll put it right here, too.

17:10.849 --> 17:11.515
No. I stand here.

17:11.517 --> 17:12.183
No, I stand here.

17:12.185 --> 17:12.849
No, I stand here!

17:12.852 --> 17:13.517
No, I stand here!

17:13.519 --> 17:14.117
I stand here!

17:14.119 --> 17:14.685
I stand here!

17:14.686 --> 17:15.419
No! Take them off!

17:15.421 --> 17:15.953
Take them off!

17:15.954 --> 17:16.521
Shove me out!

17:16.522 --> 17:17.454
Take them off! Take them off!

17:17.457 --> 17:18.455
(crashing)

17:18.458 --> 17:19.156
(laughing)

17:19.157 --> 17:20.156
Wow, brother.

17:20.159 --> 17:21.157
See, that looks bad.

17:21.160 --> 17:21.692
(horn honking)

17:21.694 --> 17:22.693
Tell you what.

17:22.694 --> 17:23.694
You hold on to these.

17:23.695 --> 17:24.528
My hands are clean.

17:24.530 --> 17:25.496
Good luck with this, by the way.

17:25.498 --> 17:27.364
Have fun.

17:27.366 --> 17:28.432
Come back here.

17:28.434 --> 17:29.533
Come back here!

17:29.535 --> 17:32.202
You are really, really,
really impressing me.

17:32.204 --> 17:36.473
That defense that you came up
with for the Yamag... Yabagoyas.

17:36.475 --> 17:37.308
Yabagoya?

17:37.310 --> 17:38.142
Yeah.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.343
It was just genius!

17:39.345 --> 17:41.779
The way I'm looking at it, if you
can't afford a porterhouse,

17:41.781 --> 17:43.280
then you deserve hepatitis!

17:43.282 --> 17:46.516
(laughing)

17:46.518 --> 17:49.353
And at first, I saw you, you
reminded me of the son that I

17:49.355 --> 17:51.955
never had if I, if I
impregnated a waitress.

17:51.957 --> 17:52.856
You know what you are now?

17:52.858 --> 17:54.024
You know what you are to me?

17:54.026 --> 17:57.795
You're the son that I would have
if I stuffed it in my media coach.

17:57.797 --> 17:58.795
Where's my ball?

17:58.797 --> 17:59.796
Oh, here we go.

17:59.798 --> 18:00.631
Oh!

18:00.633 --> 18:02.166
(coughs)

18:02.168 --> 18:03.166
Look!

18:03.168 --> 18:04.234
This isn't my ball!

18:04.236 --> 18:05.068
Why'd you stop?

18:05.070 --> 18:06.970
I don't know what the
right answer is, sir.

18:06.972 --> 18:07.805
Come on!

18:07.807 --> 18:08.639
Doesn't make sense.

18:08.641 --> 18:09.506
I know.

18:09.508 --> 18:10.374
Are you a betting man?

18:10.376 --> 18:11.208
Yeah.

18:11.210 --> 18:12.342
Payton Hillis. Cleveland?

18:12.344 --> 18:13.343
Out sick.

18:13.345 --> 18:14.210
That's bad, right?

18:14.212 --> 18:15.045
Well, yeah.

18:15.047 --> 18:16.813
The good thing is, he called in sick.

18:16.815 --> 18:18.582
He's not gonna get the other
employees sick, now is he?

18:18.584 --> 18:20.350
I would never do that either, sir.

18:20.352 --> 18:21.251
Of course not.

18:21.253 --> 18:22.086
Why would you do that?

18:22.088 --> 18:22.920
Right.

18:22.922 --> 18:23.754
(sniffs)

18:23.756 --> 18:24.588
You know what?

18:24.590 --> 18:27.024
Only assholes would come to work
and get other pe sople sick.

18:27.026 --> 18:28.659
Copy that.

18:28.661 --> 18:29.828
I'll be right out there, Mr.

18:29.830 --> 18:30.829
Hudabega.

18:30.831 --> 18:32.331
(coughs)

18:32.333 --> 18:34.233
Okay.

18:34.235 --> 18:36.067
I just gotta get Peyton
Hillis out of my lineup.

18:36.069 --> 18:36.901
(groans)

18:36.903 --> 18:38.937
Why isn't there Internet
in this goddamn golf cart?

18:38.939 --> 18:41.206
Call Kevin.

18:41.208 --> 18:42.040
(phone ringing)

18:42.042 --> 18:42.874
This is unbelievable.

18:42.876 --> 18:43.908
It's not moving.

18:43.910 --> 18:45.043
(phone rings)

18:45.045 --> 18:46.010
Hello?

18:46.012 --> 18:47.112
Hey, Kevin, it's Ruxin.

18:47.114 --> 18:49.214
I gotta be fast, 'cause
my phone's about to die.

18:49.216 --> 18:50.682
Oh, hi, Ruxin.

18:50.684 --> 18:51.783
How are you?

18:51.785 --> 18:52.617
I'm fine.

18:52.619 --> 18:54.385
Can you please take Peyton
Hillis out of my lineup, please?

18:54.387 --> 18:56.787
Yeah, I-I don't think I can do
it, I'm stuck in traffic and

18:56.789 --> 18:58.622
I can't pull over to
the side right now.

18:58.624 --> 19:02.359
Plus, that would be the same as us helping
Taco, and we would never want to be

19:02.361 --> 19:04.228
accused of starting a
shadow government here.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.262
Kevin... Kevin?

19:05.264 --> 19:06.530
(voice breaking up)

19:06.532 --> 19:07.932
Hello?

19:07.934 --> 19:08.799
Okay.

19:31.559 --> 19:32.558
You're sick!

19:32.560 --> 19:33.392
Uh-uh.

19:33.394 --> 19:34.226
You lied!

19:34.228 --> 19:35.060
No.

19:35.062 --> 19:35.894
Robbie.

19:35.896 --> 19:36.728
What?

19:36.730 --> 19:37.562
You lied to me!

19:37.564 --> 19:38.396
It's Ruxin.

19:38.398 --> 19:39.230
You lied to me!

19:39.232 --> 19:40.064
You're sick!

19:40.066 --> 19:40.898
I'm not sick.

19:40.900 --> 19:41.732
Why'd you lie?

19:41.734 --> 19:42.566
No, no!

19:42.568 --> 19:43.400
Come on, cover your mouth.

19:43.402 --> 19:44.234
Cover your mouth.

19:44.236 --> 19:45.068
What are you, an animal?

19:45.070 --> 19:46.403
I got, I got stung by a bee.

19:46.405 --> 19:49.306
I'm allergic to bees.

19:49.308 --> 19:50.273
Oh. I got an EpiPen.

19:50.275 --> 19:51.175
I don't need an EpiPen.

19:51.177 --> 19:52.009
No.

19:52.011 --> 19:52.843
Yeah.

19:52.845 --> 19:53.678
No.

19:53.680 --> 19:54.678
Yeah.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.814
(screams)

19:56.816 --> 19:57.982
Yeah?

19:57.984 --> 19:58.850
No!

19:58.852 --> 19:59.784
No gno good.

19:59.786 --> 20:00.619
Okay.

20:00.621 --> 20:01.453
Oh, I got another one.

20:01.455 --> 20:02.320
I got another one right here.

20:02.322 --> 20:03.154
Here.

20:03.156 --> 20:03.988
This one, in the throat.

20:03.990 --> 20:04.822
No-no-no!

20:04.824 --> 20:08.493
I'm sick, I'm not allergic
to bees, I'm sick!

20:08.495 --> 20:09.527
You lied to me?

20:09.529 --> 20:10.495
(sneezes)

20:10.497 --> 20:11.496
No!

20:11.498 --> 20:13.031
Is that my phone?

20:13.033 --> 20:15.499
You shit-zipper!

20:15.501 --> 20:17.101
There's nothing moving.

20:17.103 --> 20:18.168
I just see taillights.

20:18.170 --> 20:19.303
This is where we live now.

Ooh, Yobagoya.

20:28.647 --> 20:29.847
You okay?

20:29.849 --> 20:31.649
You're a little sweaty.

20:31.651 --> 20:34.464
Yeah, well... I got a pain.

20:34.584 --> 20:37.189
Oh, God, I'm living my worst nightmare.

20:37.191 --> 20:39.491
I'm going to go Yobagoya in my car.
