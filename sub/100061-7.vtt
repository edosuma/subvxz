41:35.971 --> 41:37.756
None of what?

41:37.799 --> 41:40.062
Life.

41:40.106 --> 41:43.457
We never really get to choose
how it's gonna look.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.067
Only what we do

41:45.111 --> 41:46.939
with the information
when we get it.

41:49.724 --> 41:53.380
This whole Five-O thing started
with me burying my father.

41:53.423 --> 41:55.904
Then Joe White last year.

41:55.948 --> 41:57.558
Now my mother.

42:01.170 --> 42:02.955
[sniffles]

42:02.998 --> 42:06.132
So I don't know how I feel,

42:06.175 --> 42:09.614
but I do know that we don't get
life on our terms, Danny.

42:10.876 --> 42:12.834
It's life on life's terms

42:12.878 --> 42:14.793
or not at all.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.015
Hey, Steve.

42:20.059 --> 42:22.452
What?The bed.

42:22.496 --> 42:23.889
That's-that's, uh...

42:23.932 --> 42:25.586
that's big enough
for two people, right?

42:27.153 --> 42:28.937
No.I just... I just did,

42:28.981 --> 42:32.680
uh, ten hours on a coach flight
next to a mouth breather.

42:32.724 --> 42:34.682
You're on the couch.Steve?

42:34.726 --> 42:36.249
Hmm.

42:36.292 --> 42:38.033
I'll sleep on the couch.
