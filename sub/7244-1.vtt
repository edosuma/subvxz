02:44.087 --> 02:46.087
Give me the second field.

02:46.385 --> 02:48.658
- At once, sir.
<i>- Second field, activate.</i>

02:48.800 --> 02:53.442
This is Akir, a planet of stone
with a single green spot.

02:53.713 --> 02:56.392
Let's see it. Field five.

02:56.471 --> 02:58.573
<i>- Fifth field.
- Fifth field.</i>

02:58.685 --> 03:00.170
What about their forms?

03:00.270 --> 03:04.775
Compatible with ours: Oxygen
burners with lateral symmetry.

03:05.921 --> 03:09.921
They have a solar technology,
no known defence capacity.

03:09.952 --> 03:11.975
Interesting. Let's check that.

03:12.029 --> 03:15.061
The only craft they have
is an old weather ship.

03:19.038 --> 03:23.109
We've got a few cloud formations. Look
like negative ion over the fertile region.

03:23.209 --> 03:27.498
Nothing to worry about.
And as for that cold front...

03:27.514 --> 03:29.921
Hey Gar, I'm picking up something here.

03:35.180 --> 03:37.008
We got visitors!

03:37.055 --> 03:41.353
Hello there! Welcome to the outer
atmosphere of the planet Akir.

03:43.521 --> 03:45.521
Put it through the language translator.

03:49.550 --> 03:52.355
Hello? Could you identify yourself, please?

04:46.376 --> 04:48.376
What is it?

04:51.382 --> 04:55.010
<i>Hear me, beings of Akir.</i>

04:55.906 --> 04:59.034
<i>I am Sador of the Malmori.</i>

04:59.771 --> 05:03.441
<i>I have come with my forces to conquer you.</i>

05:04.843 --> 05:08.472
<i>If you resist, I will crush you.</i>

05:08.890 --> 05:11.983
I possess a stellar converter,

05:12.151 --> 05:15.180
the most powerful weapon in the universe.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.921
You cannot resist me.

05:18.408 --> 05:22.220
<i>I want your planet to be my colony.</i>

05:22.664 --> 05:27.782
<i>You harvest comes in seven
risings of your red giant.</i>

05:28.334 --> 05:30.334
<i>I will return then</i>

05:31.397 --> 05:35.068
and you will accept me as your master.

05:35.633 --> 05:40.776
If you do not submit, your planet
and all life on it

05:40.847 --> 05:43.433
<i>will be burned to ash.</i>

05:47.604 --> 05:49.604
Snipers forward.

05:50.229 --> 05:51.206
Snipers!

05:52.268 --> 05:53.331
Forward!

05:53.860 --> 05:55.860
Fire at will.

06:12.394 --> 06:16.799
<i>Merely a demonstration, beings of Akir.</i>

06:18.022 --> 06:21.693
I will return in seven risings.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.683
<i>You are mine.</i>

06:37.931 --> 06:38.923
Yago.

06:40.059 --> 06:42.754
Pick a fighter to stay
behind and watch them.

06:44.051 --> 06:46.136
Full thrust, Umateal.

06:47.580 --> 06:49.705
I have a promise to keep.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.676
No, no. Listen to me. We don't know how.

07:02.691 --> 07:04.996
We live by the Varda.
The Varda is not to fight.

07:05.028 --> 07:06.676
The Akira haven't fought for centuries.

07:06.707 --> 07:08.850
I have fought.

07:08.943 --> 07:10.920
And I am a son of Akir.

07:11.020 --> 07:13.020
And you are an old man.

07:13.051 --> 07:16.262
I have lasted this long by fighting.

07:16.281 --> 07:19.256
We are all going to be killed.
We are defenceless.

07:19.904 --> 07:22.029
To fight creatures of violence

07:22.490 --> 07:25.118
you must use creatures of violence.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.189
- Hire mercenaries?
- We have no wealth to offer them.

07:29.289 --> 07:31.669
The violent fight for many reasons.

07:31.875 --> 07:34.765
Well yes, but then who will protect
us against these mercenaries?

07:35.545 --> 07:38.216
For that we have the Varda.

07:38.247 --> 07:39.638
Who will find them?

07:40.122 --> 07:41.159
I will.

07:41.259 --> 07:43.876
You? You're a boy...

07:45.734 --> 07:49.000
The Varda teach us that
each form has its function.

07:49.039 --> 07:52.804
My brother is the only one
who can fly Zed's ship.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.460
That's a junk pile.

07:54.530 --> 07:55.757
Junk pile!

07:56.114 --> 07:58.114
I've taken her up.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.746
I think she trusts me.

08:03.698 --> 08:05.698
And your first mission:

08:05.791 --> 08:08.869
Go to the Phoenix Cluster.
Find the station Dr. Hephaestus.

08:08.912 --> 08:10.952
The best weapons man in the system.

08:10.982 --> 08:15.168
Drop my name and he'll be sure to help you,
if he's still operative...

08:21.925 --> 08:26.095
I'm turning the boy over to you, Nell.
Take good care of him.

08:27.513 --> 08:29.513
Hello, Nell.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.380
Nell?

08:39.020 --> 08:40.044
Hello, Nell?

08:50.729 --> 08:52.605
Are you there, old girl?

08:52.705 --> 08:56.408
<i>- Nobody calls me that but Zed.</i>
- Sorry.

08:57.377 --> 09:00.540
<i>This isn't going to be just another
planetary joy ride, you know.</i>

09:00.595 --> 09:04.782
I know that, Nell. I'll do
my best not to let you down.

09:05.385 --> 09:06.378
<i>We'll see.</i>

09:06.478 --> 09:09.282
Anyway, I told them you trusted me.

09:10.251 --> 09:13.118
<i>You're okay.
A little wet behind the ears...</i>

09:13.126 --> 09:17.941
The only thing we have to remember is
that if we don't make it, nobody else will.

09:44.191 --> 09:46.656
I've spent my whole life in that city now.

09:47.918 --> 09:49.621
The first time away from home.

09:49.721 --> 09:51.721
<i>I'm your home now, kid.</i>

09:55.435 --> 09:57.435
What do you think it is, Kalo?

09:57.528 --> 10:00.849
Maybe it's some of them trying
to escape to another planet.

10:01.191 --> 10:02.634
What do you think we should do?

10:02.734 --> 10:05.359
We don't have orders about escape attempts.

10:05.578 --> 10:06.805
So...?

10:07.447 --> 10:09.447
So we blow it up...

10:10.194 --> 10:12.575
just to be on the safe side!

10:22.045 --> 10:23.038
<i>Malmori fighter.</i>

10:23.138 --> 10:25.138
<i>Just one, but it's coming full thrust!</i>

10:32.972 --> 10:34.972
Okay, Nell. What do I do?

10:35.128 --> 10:36.261
Nell, what do I do?

10:39.771 --> 10:41.771
<i>Lock in on target.</i>

10:45.241 --> 10:47.241
<i>Weapons activated.</i>

10:48.894 --> 10:50.613
<i>Now!</i>

10:51.218 --> 10:52.522
<i>Blast them!</i>

10:52.553 --> 10:54.013
- I can't.
<i>- What?</i>

10:54.029 --> 10:56.966
I can't! I mean if we blast them,
we're going to tip our hand.

10:57.029 --> 11:00.294
Wait a minute. Wait... Wait a minute.
Can we outrun them?

11:00.310 --> 11:03.685
<i>We sure as hell cannot fight them,
not with you in the driver's seat.</i>

11:09.467 --> 11:11.467
Right, Kalo, right!

11:11.592 --> 11:12.522
Turn...

11:12.743 --> 11:16.899
Turn it! Get me a shot!
Just one clear shot!

11:16.946 --> 11:20.266
I'm trying, I'm trying, but
he won't stand and fight.

11:20.758 --> 11:24.647
- Kalo, get me a shot!
- Cut it out! Go back to work.

11:56.478 --> 11:58.478
Why are we slowing down?

12:00.669 --> 12:02.416
We were ordered to watch the planet.

12:02.447 --> 12:04.471
To hell with orders.

12:04.494 --> 12:06.774
I want that ship.

12:07.551 --> 12:10.879
Remember Lobo?
He disobeyed orders

12:10.945 --> 12:13.070
and now Sador is wearing his left foot.

12:17.744 --> 12:19.744
Maybe we better go back.

12:27.355 --> 12:30.636
<i>Showing my backside to those
mutant sons of bitches.</i>

12:30.655 --> 12:33.460
<i>I can't believe it!
You got no backbone, kid.</i>

12:33.530 --> 12:34.842
<i>When Zed was your age...</i>

12:34.935 --> 12:39.270
My job is to find mercenaries.
And I'm not Zed.

12:39.724 --> 12:42.683
<i>You bet! Not even a pale imitation.</i>

12:43.561 --> 12:47.216
You know, I thought I did pretty well back there.
I mean, you're still in one piece, aren't you?

12:47.274 --> 12:51.779
<i>Sure you did there, but at the contest for running
away, you'll be champion of the universe.</i>

12:52.577 --> 12:55.366
Why don't you...? Why don't...

12:55.843 --> 12:58.320
Just take me to the Hephaestus Station.

13:21.183 --> 13:24.761
<i>The station of Dr. Hephaestus, Shad.
There, dead ahead.</i>

13:58.831 --> 14:01.636
This is an emissary from the planet Akir.

14:18.834 --> 14:20.834
Dr. Hephaestus?

14:37.352 --> 14:39.759
Does anybody receive my transmission?

14:44.766 --> 14:48.641
I'll have to go in anyway.
Manual controls, Nell.

14:48.686 --> 14:50.726
Give me the docking thrusters, please.

16:57.377 --> 16:59.377
Who sent you?

17:00.443 --> 17:02.443
What have you come for?

17:08.234 --> 17:11.828
Oh, audio malfunction, huh?
I'll have to take a look at your banks.

17:12.955 --> 17:14.955
Wait a minute! I'm not an android.

17:15.708 --> 17:17.527
You're warm!

17:17.627 --> 17:19.112
Of course I'm warm.

17:19.212 --> 17:22.507
I'm organic. Haven't you
ever seen an organic form?

17:23.550 --> 17:26.516
No! Except my father.

17:27.070 --> 17:27.977
What?

17:29.222 --> 17:31.602
There are only the androids.

17:33.067 --> 17:35.067
I take care of them.

17:36.245 --> 17:37.659
I see. Well...

17:38.820 --> 17:43.240
If you would like to let me out of this,
I'll tell you why I'm here. Please.

17:43.695 --> 17:47.435
Unless I can bring back a fighting force
and offer some resistance, we're finished.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.350
Do you think your father will help?

17:49.450 --> 17:52.935
Your father isn't the way he was when
your friend Zed knew him, you'll see.

17:53.079 --> 17:55.125
As long as he gives us the weapons.

17:55.174 --> 17:56.516
We're here.

17:58.678 --> 18:02.631
You go on alone. It's father's wish.

18:14.269 --> 18:17.097
You are welcome, Shad of the Akira.

18:19.011 --> 18:22.984
Thank you, doctor.
This is quite a surprise.

18:23.034 --> 18:25.860
I heard your story in the cargo.

18:26.446 --> 18:30.158
When you're in my station,
you're in my presence.

18:31.159 --> 18:34.354
Great. And we won't waste time.
Will you help us, doctor?

18:34.454 --> 18:39.501
I am an old man. Older even than Zed.

18:40.001 --> 18:45.016
I have seen many wars, large
and small, throughout the galaxies.

18:46.038 --> 18:50.209
Forms must pray on other forms to survive.

18:50.926 --> 18:54.496
That's not what the Varda teach us.
We pray on no one.

18:54.599 --> 18:58.478
Your planet is doomed.
And I have other plans for you.

18:59.134 --> 19:00.755
Other plans?

19:00.855 --> 19:03.235
This station was built for many.

19:03.691 --> 19:07.111
It remains a hollow and lonely place.

19:08.154 --> 19:10.240
You've met my daughter.

19:11.474 --> 19:12.326
Yes.

19:15.161 --> 19:16.583
Wait a minute.

19:19.332 --> 19:24.746
You don't mean that you want me
to breed with your daughter?

19:24.885 --> 19:29.756
<i>It seems a better fate than that
offered by the Malmori, does it not?</i>

19:30.801 --> 19:34.504
<i>You would stay here in peace forever.</i>

19:34.549 --> 19:37.779
What about your daughter?
Have you asked what she wants?

19:37.994 --> 19:45.275
Leprus, Skew, escort the
gentleman to Nanelia's room.

19:45.441 --> 19:47.821
He's got a lot to think about.

20:03.093 --> 20:04.062
Hi.

20:04.671 --> 20:10.335
Father wanted me to talk to you. He means
to keep you here for me. I'm sorry.

20:13.595 --> 20:17.126
I do not have time for this.
Don't you have enough toys?

20:20.568 --> 20:24.393
He said you're sure to be killed.
I wouldn't want that.

20:24.564 --> 20:28.475
Saunders, prepare the conjugal suite.

20:28.967 --> 20:30.778
Fresh bedding, everything.

20:31.229 --> 20:33.935
The gentleman will be staying, then, sir?

20:33.948 --> 20:35.948
He will.

20:36.534 --> 20:38.870
Nanelia will convince him.

20:39.950 --> 20:42.036
I'm sure she will, sir.

20:42.790 --> 20:45.595
The defence of his planet is hopeless.

20:45.790 --> 20:47.959
He will understand that.

20:48.282 --> 20:50.546
I'm sure he will, sir.

20:50.639 --> 20:53.660
We will have children here, Saunders.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.986
Noise, excitement, life.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.517
It will be quite a change, sir.

21:01.300 --> 21:04.723
In the colder season, even the grasses
in the meadows changes colour.

21:04.781 --> 21:06.191
Chlorophyll content.

21:06.272 --> 21:11.061
Whatever.
They turn bright red, yellow, orange.

21:11.486 --> 21:15.056
They change shade and
wave when the wind blows.

21:15.701 --> 21:16.872
Wind?

21:17.709 --> 21:19.193
Yes, wind.

21:19.418 --> 21:22.543
It's... It's rather like your
ventilation system in here.

21:22.645 --> 21:27.602
You know, rapid ventilation, but it's
different, bigger than this, but it's wind.

21:27.710 --> 21:32.194
I've scanned all these things in our data
banks, but I've never experienced them.

21:32.233 --> 21:38.108
Do you know there's a form in the Black Galaxy whose
children have no immune system till the age of five cycles?

21:38.137 --> 21:41.910
That means that at the slightest trace of
infection they would just rot like fallen fruit

21:41.949 --> 21:44.417
I have heard of them. The Huddite.

21:45.152 --> 21:46.894
Who asked you?

21:47.115 --> 21:49.639
When they reach the age of five cycles

21:49.655 --> 21:51.968
all the relatives gather
together in a special room

21:52.020 --> 21:56.888
and they watch while the child tears and bites
at his plastoid with its teeth and nails

21:56.906 --> 21:59.392
till it breaks out in the
arms of his parents.

21:59.492 --> 22:01.867
Feels their skin for the first time.

22:02.874 --> 22:05.170
Feels the wetness on their
cheeks for the first time.

22:05.251 --> 22:10.096
It's horrible out there. Forms
preying on other forms. Death...

22:11.219 --> 22:15.299
Most of them never do develop immunities.
They die shortly afterwards.

22:15.675 --> 22:19.846
But the Huddite still feel that the
breaking out ceremony is very beautiful.

22:21.787 --> 22:24.415
You really want to go
back there, don't you?

22:24.845 --> 22:26.931
Even if it's certain you'll end?

22:27.478 --> 22:30.751
Oh yes. I'm going back.

22:34.183 --> 22:35.887
Step into the Captor Grid.

22:35.987 --> 22:39.674
I must warn you, miss Nanelia. That would
cause the Captor Grid to short circuit.

22:39.979 --> 22:41.042
So...

22:57.028 --> 22:59.661
Come with me. You know about computers.
You can help us.

22:59.755 --> 23:02.179
I can't! I can't leave my father.

23:02.604 --> 23:05.362
I wish I had time to stay and
convince you, but it's your life.

23:06.287 --> 23:08.287
Such as it is...

23:10.396 --> 23:12.396
Dummy.

23:23.451 --> 23:25.451
<i>What took you so long?</i>

23:25.474 --> 23:28.938
- He wanted me to stay for dinner.
<i>- And how is old Doc Hephaestus?</i>

23:28.950 --> 23:32.233
Well, he's not the man he used to be.
Let's get out of here.

23:38.784 --> 23:40.784
<i>Come with me. You can help us.</i>

24:16.839 --> 24:18.839
No weapons at all?

24:18.949 --> 24:24.910
No, but I brought an analyser. We can predict
their attack modes and plan a defence.

24:25.471 --> 24:29.891
<i>I'd like to exchange data with that thing.
Might be some new wrinkles I should catch up on.</i>

24:31.072 --> 24:32.439
<i>Who's that?</i>

24:32.465 --> 24:34.314
It's just Nell.

24:34.393 --> 24:35.409
Nell?

24:36.226 --> 24:39.468
I'll introduce you later, back on Akir.

24:41.112 --> 24:43.322
<i>Wait for me in the Lambda Zone.</i>

25:04.052 --> 25:06.772
Our emissary has returned from Umateal.

25:08.075 --> 25:10.518
They have replied to our ultimatum.

25:11.567 --> 25:12.419
And?

25:22.320 --> 25:24.320
What's this?

25:24.350 --> 25:26.413
It is our emissary, sir.

25:29.077 --> 25:31.670
They have powdered him.

25:36.241 --> 25:40.701
They are a proud form.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.777
In an hour they'll be an extinct one.

25:44.717 --> 25:49.740
Not a trace of them left,
not even their dust.

25:55.370 --> 25:58.173
Think the girl will be all right
crossing through the Lambda Zone?

25:58.210 --> 26:02.601
<i>Well in my day that was a pretty wild area, but
it's probably tamed down like everything else.</i>

26:02.615 --> 26:06.810
I suppose. She's a very
interesting form, Nell.

26:06.848 --> 26:09.738
<i>Starboard side, kid. We've got some action.</i>

26:10.426 --> 26:11.348
What is it?

26:27.331 --> 26:30.667
<i>The little ones are Jackers.
They're breaking down his force shield.</i>

26:30.768 --> 26:33.956
<i>- Then what?
- They incinerate him and steal his load.</i>

26:38.075 --> 26:43.247
♪ Sixteen gamblers to carry my coffin ♪

26:43.296 --> 26:46.154
♪ Six purty maidens to sing... ♪

26:50.619 --> 26:53.747
♪ And lay the sod on me ♪

26:54.805 --> 27:00.492
♪ For I'm a poor cowboy
Know I done wrong ♪

27:00.835 --> 27:03.592
<i>This is Space Cowboy. S.O.S.</i>

27:03.812 --> 27:04.874
Mayday.

27:05.655 --> 27:07.257
Help!

27:07.727 --> 27:11.177
- Can we help him, Nell?
<i>- Not without a fight.</i>

27:14.493 --> 27:15.306
<i>Well...</i>

27:17.159 --> 27:20.389
You're just lucky I haven't
got any ammunition left.

27:27.028 --> 27:29.323
I've never taken life before, Nell.

27:29.395 --> 27:32.761
<i>The Varda says we can
take life to save life.</i>

27:35.203 --> 27:37.203
Okay, Nell. Let's do it.

27:38.331 --> 27:40.331
Manual controls.

27:46.067 --> 27:48.067
<i>Locking on target.</i>

27:49.300 --> 27:51.510
<i>- Fire. Fire!</i>
- Not from behind.

27:51.573 --> 27:53.573
<i>Step in it, kid. You've
got to follow through.</i>

27:53.619 --> 27:55.972
No, no. Not from behind, no.

28:02.111 --> 28:04.313
Hooray for our side.

28:05.259 --> 28:06.941
You fired without me.

28:07.143 --> 28:08.955
<i>It had to be done.</i>

28:10.154 --> 28:12.654
You're placed under my direct command.
You fired without me.

28:12.740 --> 28:14.621
That which is not organic must not...

28:14.622 --> 28:18.365
<i>...harm that which is. I know, I know.
It's a damn stupid rule.</i>

28:18.496 --> 28:20.894
Jacker to port. Sector three.

28:55.178 --> 28:56.459
I did it.

28:59.304 --> 29:00.499
I...

29:01.350 --> 29:03.248
didn't think, I just did it.

29:03.833 --> 29:07.286
<i>You had to, kid. You done fine.</i>

29:11.845 --> 29:13.674
<i>Fighting?</i>

29:14.102 --> 29:18.166
Listen, I've done more fighting
than I've seen old movies.

29:18.376 --> 29:21.453
Which is saying a lot seeing
that's all I do on long hauls.

29:21.571 --> 29:22.500
Well...

29:24.207 --> 29:26.871
I have the greatest
collection of old westerns...

29:26.937 --> 29:29.773
We'll need experienced soldiers.
Would you care to fight with us?

29:31.889 --> 29:35.833
Yeah, you see, you're fighting Sador.

29:36.540 --> 29:39.668
Sador's never lost a war. He never quits.

29:40.301 --> 29:43.926
You fight Sador, you've got a
snowball's chance in hell.

29:45.012 --> 29:46.082
Snowball?

29:46.129 --> 29:50.262
<i>Transmission from the planet Umateal.
The Malmori force has arrived.</i>

29:50.463 --> 29:52.463
Put it up on the screen, Nell.

30:20.702 --> 30:22.342
Stellar converter...

30:54.505 --> 30:56.075
See what I mean?

31:01.515 --> 31:02.809
Umateal.

31:04.339 --> 31:05.958
That was my customer.

31:07.247 --> 31:12.380
How would you like 10.000 Mach Laser 4's
and 40.000 Charge Snides?

31:12.419 --> 31:14.322
They're paid for and I haven't
got the fuel to get them home.

31:14.422 --> 31:16.468
You're carrying weapons?

31:16.515 --> 31:19.344
They're hand weapons, the best we make.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.242
We're going to need weapons...

31:22.991 --> 31:26.150
but we won't know how to use them.

31:27.155 --> 31:28.147
Yeah.

31:28.814 --> 31:32.734
And we'll probably need someone
to teach us how to use them.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.923
Yes, I can see that.

31:37.862 --> 31:39.846
And we did save your life.

31:44.065 --> 31:47.502
Okay. My rig's a hauler, not a fighter, but

31:47.536 --> 31:49.536
I'll set up your ground defences.

31:50.124 --> 31:52.264
Agreed? Put it there.

31:53.261 --> 31:55.674
- I'm not the cavalry.
- Cavalry?

31:57.423 --> 32:00.552
I'll show you! You've got
a treat in store for you.

32:01.410 --> 32:06.386
As a matter of fact, I'll show
you Custer's Last Stand.

33:40.189 --> 33:42.282
Yes indeed.

33:42.916 --> 33:45.404
A pretty tasty looking morsel.

33:46.398 --> 33:47.728
Who are you?

33:47.778 --> 33:52.074
Your saviours. You were about
to be digested by a Zime.

33:52.528 --> 33:53.661
A Zime?

33:53.832 --> 33:57.934
A creature who consumes living organisms.

33:58.002 --> 33:59.487
We're Zimeirs.

33:59.587 --> 34:02.173
We cook them down for their protein.

34:03.751 --> 34:07.055
I am Cayman of the Lambda Zone.

34:07.119 --> 34:09.882
And these are my crew.

34:09.938 --> 34:10.915
They're burning me.

34:10.952 --> 34:15.257
They're Kelvin. Urim and Thunim.

34:15.279 --> 34:20.013
The Kelvin are a thermal creature.
They communicate in degrees of heat.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.646
And this is Quopeg...

34:22.708 --> 34:24.184
My Kunar.

34:24.245 --> 34:27.518
Well, I'd like to thank you all very much.
Now just get me down.

34:27.543 --> 34:31.761
Now, now, now! Don't be too grateful.

34:31.793 --> 34:38.355
I know a market where a female form like
yours would bring in some heavy dust.

34:38.429 --> 34:41.547
You'd do that? You'd sell me?

34:41.900 --> 34:46.614
Well of course! Live or for protein.
I do whatever pays the most.

34:48.370 --> 34:52.612
I'm hiring mercenaries for a
great battle on the planet Akir.

34:53.766 --> 34:55.766
Is that so?

34:56.038 --> 34:59.135
What could this planet Akir offer me?

35:01.174 --> 35:05.254
They have the richest molybdenum
deposits in the system.

35:06.821 --> 35:10.625
Nice try, hot blood, but
I've already seen Akir

35:10.821 --> 35:13.620
and there is absolutely nothing
on that planet that I want.

35:14.524 --> 35:17.248
You're heartless. You're just like Sador!

35:17.321 --> 35:18.454
Sador.

35:18.518 --> 35:22.196
Sador? Sador of the Malmori?

35:23.069 --> 35:25.069
It's who we're fighting against.

35:25.876 --> 35:26.782
Quopeg!

35:28.176 --> 35:33.136
So, Sador lives, does he?
Your ship will need some repair.

35:33.302 --> 35:38.325
Quopeg, cut the Zime loose.
We cruise for Akir!

35:48.275 --> 35:52.610
<i>We're being pulled in by something.
Feels like a magnetic net. Look, sector 2.</i>

35:56.795 --> 35:58.780
Damn it. Prepare full thrust.
We'll break loose.

35:58.834 --> 36:01.404
<i>I'm not strong.
Remember the Varda.</i>

36:01.459 --> 36:03.459
What about the Varda?

36:07.379 --> 36:09.943
<i>- Think. What would the Varda say?</i>
- Nell!

36:09.988 --> 36:14.003
<i>To use greater strength against itself.
It's our only hope, kid.</i>

36:16.354 --> 36:20.519
All right, big mouth. Change
course, right into their laps.

36:45.795 --> 36:48.287
Okay, what's the big idea?

36:54.000 --> 36:56.086
Don't everybody talk at once.

37:01.537 --> 37:05.701
Listen, if I don't get some answers fast,
I'm going to have to use this thing.

37:21.748 --> 37:23.748
Let me rephrase that.

37:33.499 --> 37:35.539
You are not of a violent form.

37:36.974 --> 37:39.269
We sensed that you did not intend to shoot.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.599
You read my mind?

37:42.602 --> 37:46.512
Among other things. We have
monitored your travels.

37:46.773 --> 37:50.039
You are seeking mercenaries
for an adventure.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.443
We would like to participate.

37:55.567 --> 37:57.567
Well, we can't offer much in payment.

37:58.039 --> 38:02.210
No need. We are self-sufficient.
We are Nestor.

38:03.456 --> 38:04.941
All of you?

38:05.048 --> 38:08.193
This is but a facet.
These are but facets.

38:08.670 --> 38:13.685
There are hundreds of thousands like us at home
and scattered throughout the universe.

38:13.883 --> 38:15.883
We are Nestor.

38:15.976 --> 38:17.454
You're clones.

38:17.772 --> 38:22.608
In a manner of speaking.
We share identical consciousness.

38:23.268 --> 38:27.338
What one sees, all see.
What one knows, all know.

38:27.438 --> 38:29.195
And all of you want to help us?

38:29.266 --> 38:31.453
These five facets, yes.

38:31.518 --> 38:33.874
Four of us are required
to operate this ship.

38:33.921 --> 38:36.556
- What about the fifth?
- We always carry a spare.

38:38.351 --> 38:39.621
Thank you.

38:39.738 --> 38:44.895
You see, there is only one
Nestor. One consciousness.

38:45.023 --> 38:48.148
As you might imagine,
this is proving very lonely.

38:48.293 --> 38:52.175
Very dull. We must avoid becoming...

38:52.830 --> 38:55.220
We believe you have a phrase for it.

38:55.283 --> 38:58.514
...becoming "bored to death".

39:04.732 --> 39:08.592
Look, Kalo. Females.

39:09.271 --> 39:12.076
<i>A bonding approved for procreation.</i>

39:12.470 --> 39:16.125
A bonding conceived in the
face of our present crisis.

39:16.852 --> 39:19.147
We're supposed to guard the planet.

39:20.617 --> 39:22.617
Where is it gonna go?

39:22.952 --> 39:25.640
Come on, let's do it!

39:25.931 --> 39:28.296
It would make you happy, wouldn't it?

39:28.395 --> 39:31.473
What the hell, they're only Akira.

39:43.258 --> 39:44.890
Everybody scatter!

39:51.088 --> 39:53.698
Beam her up, Kalo. Beam her up!

40:10.439 --> 40:14.610
<i>In the old days Nascosto was one of the
wildest cities in the Smilax System.</i>

40:14.838 --> 40:19.978
<i>Freebooters, outlaws, adventurers. If you're
looking for mercenaries, that's the place.</i>

40:20.051 --> 40:22.051
Doesn't look like much of a city to me.

40:22.136 --> 40:23.729
<i>It's all under the surface.</i>

40:23.769 --> 40:26.011
<i>The weather is a bit touchy up on top.</i>

40:26.042 --> 40:31.112
<i>There are tornadoes and radiation storms every
couple of days. Keeps the tourists away.</i>

43:27.238 --> 43:28.769
Who sent you?

43:30.355 --> 43:34.026
I'm on a mission for the people of Akir.

43:34.779 --> 43:36.819
I'm hiring mercenaries.

43:37.789 --> 43:40.594
I was told that there would
be many on Nascosto.

43:42.045 --> 43:49.404
You're a little late. There's nothing
left but me and the lower forms.

43:54.032 --> 43:55.806
What happened here?

43:56.351 --> 43:59.851
The other planets in the galaxy
formed a protective association.

44:00.453 --> 44:03.258
They raised an army and cleaned us out.

44:04.710 --> 44:06.342
We made them nervous.

44:07.904 --> 44:09.436
But you stayed.

44:11.533 --> 44:13.600
I came back for a rest.

44:14.879 --> 44:18.402
There's not a planet in the galaxy
where there isn't a bounty on my head.

44:19.136 --> 44:20.957
What makes you so popular?

44:22.296 --> 44:25.803
I settle disputes, very quickly.

44:25.853 --> 44:29.523
I'm very good at it.
I don't care who I work with.

44:29.875 --> 44:32.510
I've collected a lot of
enemies along the way.

44:33.624 --> 44:35.553
You kill for a pay?

44:36.620 --> 44:39.748
I have no home,
no family, no principles.

44:41.040 --> 44:43.040
What else would I kill for?

44:44.023 --> 44:46.023
- Pleasure?
- No.

44:46.985 --> 44:48.985
It's strictly business with me.

44:50.113 --> 44:53.691
Now, what's your pitch?

44:56.314 --> 44:59.942
I'm hiring mercenaries to
protect against an invasion.

45:02.513 --> 45:07.226
But food and shelter is all
we can offer in payment.

45:07.256 --> 45:09.891
All of our wealth is in our culture.

45:12.447 --> 45:16.782
I could buy your planet ten times over
with what I've gathered in this room.

45:18.266 --> 45:24.022
Plutonium, cadmium, Qualine crystals...

45:26.466 --> 45:28.552
I've been very well paid for my work.

45:32.864 --> 45:34.699
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

45:34.761 --> 45:36.846
No. Wait.

45:38.900 --> 45:40.900
Listen to the rest of it.

45:41.197 --> 45:44.172
I sleep with my back to the wall

45:44.482 --> 45:46.947
when I can sleep.

45:47.493 --> 45:49.915
I eat serpent seven times a week.

45:52.938 --> 45:57.422
There's not a major city in this galaxy where
I can show my face or spend my wealth.

45:59.220 --> 46:01.806
Right now your offer looks
very attractive to me.

46:07.878 --> 46:09.878
A meal, a place to hide.

46:21.706 --> 46:23.149
So what do you think of him?

46:23.210 --> 46:26.019
<i>He'll fight all right,
but he'll fight alone.</i>

46:26.041 --> 46:28.478
I don't care, just so long as he'll fight.

46:28.548 --> 46:31.423
<i>Don't worry, he'll be pointed
in the right direction.</i>

46:31.916 --> 46:33.002
Wait a minute.

46:34.294 --> 46:35.161
What is it?

46:35.208 --> 46:38.645
<i>I don't know, but it's right in my flight path.
It could be a mercenary answering your call.</i>

46:38.661 --> 46:40.450
A mercenary in that pea shooter?

46:40.496 --> 46:43.363
<i>Listen, kid. In some galaxies,
that would be a big ship.</i>

46:43.369 --> 46:46.689
<i>Thalians aren't much bigger than your
hand, but they're some bad customers.</i>

46:46.742 --> 46:48.902
Well whoever he is, I don't
have time to play with him.

46:50.015 --> 46:51.750
<i>- Put up the force field.</i>
- What?

46:51.812 --> 46:53.812
<i>Put up the force field, hurry!</i>

46:55.380 --> 46:57.379
- What the hell is it?
<i>- A challenge.</i>

46:57.419 --> 46:58.067
What?

46:58.131 --> 47:01.770
<i>It seems he don't think this galaxy
is big enough for the both of you.</i>

47:04.708 --> 47:06.574
He's completely outmatched.
He must know that.

47:06.600 --> 47:08.957
<i>Don't lower the force field.
It's too fast for you to hit!</i>

47:09.027 --> 47:11.402
- But he keeps coming at me.
<i>- Ignore it.</i>

47:11.425 --> 47:14.191
<i>It can't hurt to forget about it.
That's what the Varda says.</i>

47:14.220 --> 47:15.558
I want a shot at him, Nell.

47:15.597 --> 47:19.117
<i>You shoot down a couple of Jackers and all of
a sudden you're the scourge of outer space.</i>

47:19.120 --> 47:21.012
Will you just shut up
and help me fight him?

47:21.105 --> 47:25.565
<i>Help yourself. You're being sucked in,
can't you see he's just playing with you?</i>

47:37.457 --> 47:38.942
What is it? What's happening?

47:39.010 --> 47:40.691
<i>- A blank.</i>
- A what?

47:40.748 --> 47:46.341
<i>Soft light, no heat. I'm not damaged.
I have a transmission.</i>

47:47.438 --> 47:49.438
<i>I am Saint Exmin of the Valkiri.</i>

47:49.969 --> 47:54.055
<i>I have come to coo upon you.
It was a very enjoyable fight.</i>

47:54.462 --> 47:55.782
Enjoyable fight?

47:55.915 --> 47:58.274
<i>But then all fighting is enjoyable.</i>

47:58.318 --> 48:01.548
I have heard of your battle with
the Malmori. I wish to join you.

48:01.650 --> 48:04.763
Oh yes? What are you going to do?
Shoot blanks at Sador?

48:04.891 --> 48:07.398
The Valkiri are great warriors.

48:07.444 --> 48:11.342
In our youth, we must leave home and fight in
many battles until we have proven ourselves.

48:11.380 --> 48:15.544
Well you've proven yourself to be a pain in
the neck, so why don't you just fly off?

48:15.642 --> 48:17.978
But I wish to fight.

48:18.012 --> 48:20.769
My planet is in danger and
you're playing tag with me.

48:20.832 --> 48:23.801
Your ship is like a toy.
You have no firepower.

48:23.836 --> 48:26.131
It's one of the fastest in the universe.

48:26.354 --> 48:29.329
Well the Varda teach us that
swift rain is little rain.

48:29.646 --> 48:31.385
<i>But I want to join.</i>

48:31.411 --> 48:34.551
But we don't want you. We don't
need you and we won't have you.

48:34.579 --> 48:37.371
So go count your coo somewhere else.

48:39.132 --> 48:41.257
<i>You were a little harsh weren't you?</i>

48:41.578 --> 48:43.258
You saw her. She was playing with me.

48:43.336 --> 48:45.546
<i>Yes, and she won.</i>

48:47.373 --> 48:50.093
Would you like me to short
circuit your audio?

48:55.318 --> 48:56.490
<i>Shad to Cowboy.</i>

48:57.338 --> 48:59.633
<i>Chad to Cowboy. Come in, Cowboy.</i>

49:00.096 --> 49:01.916
<i>Cowboy, are you there?</i>

49:04.528 --> 49:07.332
Where've you been, Shad?
You're two Martinis late.

49:07.796 --> 49:10.350
I've got some help.
We'll meet in the Lambda Zone.

49:13.730 --> 49:16.105
Is that real smoke you're
putting into your lungs?

49:16.466 --> 49:21.051
Yep. And before you ask, it is the
worst thing in the world for you.

49:22.047 --> 49:24.047
I don't think you should do it.

49:30.783 --> 49:33.102
Space Cowboy, meet Nestor.

49:36.312 --> 49:37.892
Welcome, Nestor.

49:37.915 --> 49:39.595
I'm from Earth. Ever hear of it?

49:39.651 --> 49:41.860
<i>No, but we are pleased to meet you.</i>

49:41.898 --> 49:43.741
We? How many've you got in there?

49:43.760 --> 49:45.845
I'll explain it to you later.

49:51.567 --> 49:53.707
<i>Here comes somebody else. Who's that?</i>

49:55.844 --> 49:57.325
Do you want your name used?

49:58.899 --> 50:00.485
My name is Gelt.

50:01.624 --> 50:05.679
Where are you from, Gelt?
I'm from Earth. Know where that is?

50:06.832 --> 50:08.996
I was born in space.

50:10.434 --> 50:11.379
Oh.

50:11.582 --> 50:14.965
Well, put him between us. I'll cover you.

50:16.487 --> 50:18.619
I don't like anyone behind me.

50:18.654 --> 50:21.244
<i>Okay. You keep a scanner on our tail.</i>

50:21.651 --> 50:23.552
I always do.

50:39.264 --> 50:42.162
This is Cayman of the Lambda Zone.

50:42.678 --> 50:43.819
Thank you for...

50:46.885 --> 50:48.885
Thank you for joining us.

50:49.736 --> 50:51.861
I'm only in this for Sador.

50:53.681 --> 50:55.681
I want his head.

50:56.849 --> 50:59.595
Oh, well you're welcome to it.

51:15.932 --> 51:17.682
There's someone following us.

51:22.806 --> 51:26.206
Just ignore it. Maybe she'll go away.

51:28.960 --> 51:31.139
Well, you did all right, Shad.

51:32.285 --> 51:34.085
Turning loose for Akir.

52:26.617 --> 52:27.664
A party.

52:28.094 --> 52:29.157
Three.

52:29.250 --> 52:30.266
Five.

52:30.406 --> 52:31.336
Six!

52:31.512 --> 52:32.294
Seven!

52:32.575 --> 52:34.575
Tembo, come on up here.

52:34.600 --> 52:35.996
I'm busy.

52:36.038 --> 52:38.503
Forget about her. Something's coming.

52:40.166 --> 52:42.611
- What?
- Something's coming. Seven ships.

52:42.658 --> 52:44.135
Seven.

52:44.201 --> 52:46.201
What do you think we should do?

52:47.058 --> 52:48.084
Run away?

52:48.442 --> 52:50.442
Good idea.

53:04.446 --> 53:05.532
Hurry.

53:09.327 --> 53:11.726
Hurry! It's gaining on us.

53:11.803 --> 53:13.943
They can't be! We're at full thrust!

53:22.734 --> 53:24.609
It's gaining on us!

53:24.647 --> 53:26.615
Tekias, turn and give me a shot at it!

53:26.677 --> 53:29.020
That's crazy! We do not know what is.

53:29.053 --> 53:30.248
- Get her off me!
- No!

53:30.335 --> 53:30.976
Get her off!

53:31.037 --> 53:33.076
Get her out of here! Get her out of here!

53:34.811 --> 53:36.366
We're losing speed.

53:36.437 --> 53:38.476
Turn around and face him.

53:46.413 --> 53:47.648
Beautiful.

53:49.034 --> 53:51.329
I love to see a pro at work.

53:52.166 --> 53:53.768
He's had a lot of practice.

53:53.783 --> 53:58.650
Nell, I think we may have bought ourselves
a chance. Let's head for the surface.

54:22.682 --> 54:26.072
Hail the conquering heroes.

54:27.614 --> 54:28.770
I'm sorry.

54:30.114 --> 54:31.450
I think they must be afraid.

54:31.535 --> 54:33.894
Afraid? Of what?

54:33.926 --> 54:37.949
Of you. They're not accustomed
to violence or violent forms.

54:38.030 --> 54:39.740
That's a hell of a note.

54:40.272 --> 54:42.725
Welcome to Akir.

54:45.501 --> 54:47.360
Why have you been hiding?

54:49.006 --> 54:54.068
Why are you all afraid? I brought these beings to
save your lives. This is not the way to greet them.

54:55.334 --> 55:01.333
The Varda teach us to trust
first and judge later.

55:02.375 --> 55:04.585
I'm sorry for the reception you got.

55:07.284 --> 55:08.727
Welcome to our city,

55:09.171 --> 55:11.799
defenders of Akir.

55:20.015 --> 55:22.376
The warning system is operational.

55:22.586 --> 55:26.382
The Malmori should reach us within a
rotation and a half of this planet.

55:27.446 --> 55:30.699
We have only five fighting
ships against 25 of theirs.

55:31.264 --> 55:34.266
Our only hope is to try and knock
out the stellar converter.

55:34.335 --> 55:35.986
Is that possible?

55:36.062 --> 55:37.608
Watch the screen.

55:42.100 --> 55:47.615
Like the rest of us, the Malmori ship has to
lower part of its force field in order to fire.

55:47.688 --> 55:51.568
When the stellar converter is about to be
activated the ship is extremely vulnerable.

55:51.640 --> 55:55.210
Maximum spread capacity with an
open shield delivery system.

55:55.237 --> 56:00.451
Exactly. They never bring out the converter until
all opposition has been crushed by the fighters.

56:01.041 --> 56:06.380
Our job in the first contact will be to
strip the big ship of its protection.

56:07.148 --> 56:10.718
A vibration from the
sensor to dig the ditches.

56:10.781 --> 56:12.168
Another three degrees.

56:21.047 --> 56:23.929
Trenches, honey. We're gonna have a war.

56:25.289 --> 56:27.149
That's it, right there...

56:27.163 --> 56:31.583
<i>We're gonna create the galaxy's
biggest Malmori cemetery.</i>

57:12.612 --> 57:14.612
Pretty impressive.

57:16.122 --> 57:20.117
I've got some more surprises
for any visitors.

57:20.427 --> 57:22.120
What drink is that?

57:22.192 --> 57:25.965
Scotch and soda.

57:28.839 --> 57:31.276
I could do wonders with that boy.

57:31.323 --> 57:36.901
I would recharge his capacitators,
stimulate his solenoid.

57:36.947 --> 57:42.487
Tingle, dingle, dangle,
prangle his transistors...

57:46.003 --> 57:48.276
You know, sex.

57:49.823 --> 57:52.183
I can't imagine what it must be like.

57:52.321 --> 57:54.907
Stick with me. You'll get an education.

57:55.646 --> 57:57.669
Guess so.

58:03.436 --> 58:07.107
<i>Flagship to Rear Guard 1. Do you read me?</i>

58:09.093 --> 58:12.554
<i>Flagship to Rear Guard 1. Do you read me?</i>

58:14.648 --> 58:16.983
<i>Kalo, Tembo, come in.</i>

58:18.608 --> 58:20.608
Could we possibly be out of range?

58:21.139 --> 58:24.913
Not at all, sir. Something must be wrong.

58:24.937 --> 58:29.390
What's wrong is that I have an
army full of genetic mistakes.

58:29.410 --> 58:32.605
Why can't my mutants be
intelligent like Eli?

58:32.778 --> 58:36.106
You can't expect us to
measure up to you, sir.

58:36.139 --> 58:40.134
Don't flatter me. Those two probably
slammed their ship into an asteroid.

58:40.498 --> 58:43.115
Or they may have been shot down.

58:43.148 --> 58:47.382
Shot down? How? Akir has
nothing to put in the air!

58:48.660 --> 58:50.645
Somebody came to help them.

58:51.182 --> 58:53.182
Help Akir against me?

58:55.000 --> 59:00.440
Nobody could be that stupid.
Not even Kalo and Tembo. Or you!

59:03.257 --> 59:05.662
<i>Do you think you could show me the ropes?</i>

59:09.030 --> 59:09.929
Ropes?

59:09.943 --> 59:13.071
Well St. Exmin said...
Well she explained how on her planet...

59:14.411 --> 59:16.379
What do you do here?

59:16.418 --> 59:18.403
I don't understand.

59:18.457 --> 59:20.043
For procreation, I mean.

59:21.980 --> 59:23.269
Oh.

59:24.597 --> 59:25.878
Well, it's...

59:26.245 --> 59:29.854
It's very simple, really.
Males and females...

59:29.885 --> 59:33.335
Only two sexes?
In Balandic it takes three.

59:33.510 --> 59:34.354
And Kitsel, they...

59:34.377 --> 59:37.236
Oh no, just two. Just males
and females, that's all.

59:39.064 --> 59:40.501
That's a relief.

59:42.016 --> 59:45.686
Well, maybe I... Maybe I
could show you the ropes.

59:46.565 --> 59:48.651
I've scanned information about mating.

59:49.451 --> 59:51.419
Does your species have kissing?

59:52.326 --> 59:54.954
Oh yes, we have that.

01:00:08.186 --> 01:00:10.100
I think it's your torque bar.

01:00:11.436 --> 01:00:14.717
- My what?
- Your torque bar. It's slipped its groove.

01:00:15.423 --> 01:00:17.463
You're going to need a new one.

01:00:18.611 --> 01:00:19.611
Yes.

01:00:20.229 --> 01:00:22.384
Yes, I think probably you're right.

01:00:23.572 --> 01:00:25.189
A new one.

01:01:09.787 --> 01:01:11.888
What is that you're heating?

01:01:14.586 --> 01:01:16.193
That's a hot dog.

01:01:18.246 --> 01:01:21.137
It comes from Earth. Try one.

01:01:29.181 --> 01:01:32.361
- You like it?
- There's no dog in this.

01:01:33.454 --> 01:01:37.212
Hydrolysed vegetable
protein, soy bean meal,

01:01:37.296 --> 01:01:42.578
Niacin, dextrose and
sodium nitrate flavouring.

01:01:42.643 --> 01:01:45.673
That's what we call "meat" back home.

01:02:02.534 --> 01:02:06.261
Mister, are you a bad man?

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:09.738
That's right.

01:02:09.767 --> 01:02:11.767
Why?

01:02:12.692 --> 01:02:14.778
I don't think the way you Akira do.

01:02:15.736 --> 01:02:18.322
If you think different, you get called bad.

01:02:19.991 --> 01:02:21.991
How do you feel?

01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:25.074
I don't.

01:02:25.182 --> 01:02:28.917
Mister, were you bad when you were little?

01:02:32.278 --> 01:02:34.278
I was never that little.

01:02:46.787 --> 01:02:50.177
All right, everybody. They're coming.
They've reached our checkpoints. Return to your ships.

01:02:50.301 --> 01:02:53.270
See you later, hot blood.

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:57.105
Yeah, see you later, hot blood.

01:02:58.549 --> 01:03:01.025
- So long, good luck, partner.
- Thank you.

01:03:04.821 --> 01:03:07.711
Prep your thrusters, Nell.
I'm coming aboard.

01:03:22.377 --> 01:03:23.471
Loris.

01:03:25.486 --> 01:03:29.222
Won't you come with me?
You'd like it on Earth.

01:03:30.144 --> 01:03:31.214
Cowboy.

01:03:33.272 --> 01:03:36.927
Our outer-space alarm only works
at a distance of 3 millimarks.

01:03:37.803 --> 01:03:38.498
What?

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:44.705
Sador could see any lift-off.
He would destroy you.

01:03:47.846 --> 01:03:49.196
Wonderful.

01:03:50.362 --> 01:03:52.362
I like your company.

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:54.783
Thanks.

01:04:00.448 --> 01:04:01.440
Well...

01:04:02.412 --> 01:04:04.209
Remember the Alamo.

01:04:04.263 --> 01:04:06.263
You forgot the ice and soda.

01:04:10.172 --> 01:04:11.513
No, no I didn't.

01:04:12.062 --> 01:04:15.522
Sir, something is approaching.

01:04:16.225 --> 01:04:18.225
It seems to be very small.

01:04:22.161 --> 01:04:24.456
Halt and be recognised.

01:04:26.019 --> 01:04:28.380
I am St. Exmin of the Valkiri.

01:04:31.179 --> 01:04:33.163
I am protector of this planet.

01:04:33.252 --> 01:04:35.337
I order you to leave it in peace.

01:04:36.814 --> 01:04:39.024
Blast her out of space.

01:04:39.102 --> 01:04:42.492
Activate the drones. Prepare
to launch the surface attack.

01:04:42.547 --> 01:04:44.016
Sonic tank pruned.

01:05:41.777 --> 01:05:44.157
<i>All right, Shad, this one's ours.</i>

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:21.920
<i>Attaboy, Shad.</i>

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.585
<i>Uh-oh, nuclear missile.</i>

01:08:36.639 --> 01:08:39.591
<i>The only chance with these
babies is to outrun them.</i>

01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:45.408
<i>It's locked on to us.
You can't knock it out.</i>

01:08:46.618 --> 01:08:50.073
All right. Let's head for Sador.

01:09:32.555 --> 01:09:33.680
Gelt!

01:09:34.290 --> 01:09:37.439
- Gelt, are you all right?
<i>- That remains to be seen, Shad.</i>

01:09:38.729 --> 01:09:40.433
Have a nice fight.

01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:05.437
First unit! First unit, move out!

01:10:05.439 --> 01:10:08.872
Tank unit, stand by.
Repeat, stand by for orders.

01:10:09.062 --> 01:10:11.257
Char, check all systems.

01:10:11.518 --> 01:10:13.518
Second unit, move out.

01:10:14.182 --> 01:10:18.447
All right, boys. The sons of bitches have
landed. Section two. Get to your posts.

01:10:18.463 --> 01:10:21.229
Section five, next.
Section three, wait here.

01:10:22.256 --> 01:10:25.416
Move it! Kick ass, boys. Kick ass.

01:10:25.951 --> 01:10:27.061
Come on, move it.

01:10:27.725 --> 01:10:28.569
Move it.

01:10:29.069 --> 01:10:30.061
Move it!

01:10:54.053 --> 01:10:55.420
Sector two.

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:24.924
Retreat! Retreat! Retreat!

01:11:26.025 --> 01:11:28.994
Move the tank up. Move up the sonic tank!

01:11:50.506 --> 01:11:52.084
What the hell is that?

01:11:52.116 --> 01:11:56.366
Some sort of sonic weapon.
We can't defend against it.

01:11:56.392 --> 01:11:59.367
Maybe another rockslide'll stop it.
Come on.

01:12:06.426 --> 01:12:08.224
Sector three rock slide didn't work.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.216
The sonar weapon is jamming the sensor.

01:12:10.242 --> 01:12:11.023
Fall back to section five.

01:12:11.051 --> 01:12:12.887
- We gotta get back. We'll all be killed, you hear me?
- Fall back to sector five!

01:12:12.927 --> 01:12:14.138
We will all be killed.

01:12:38.201 --> 01:12:42.389
A sonar tank. They're wearing sound
barriers in case they get in front of it.

01:12:42.466 --> 01:12:45.364
Even if we plug our ears,
we can't get any closer.

01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:48.406
Will you two radiators stand back?
It's hard enough to think.

01:12:48.425 --> 01:12:50.574
It seems they're volunteering.

01:12:50.651 --> 01:12:51.706
Hell, what can they do?

01:12:51.711 --> 01:12:55.273
Well, for one thing, the
Kelvin have no ears.

01:13:34.625 --> 01:13:37.111
- They're cold.
- They've used all their energy.

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:40.070
- Get them to the protein tank. Hurry.
- Come on, let's go.

01:13:41.929 --> 01:13:43.499
We got them now, boys.

01:13:52.168 --> 01:13:53.785
Let's go get them.

01:14:40.113 --> 01:14:41.441
What's the matter?

01:14:43.238 --> 01:14:45.840
What is it, Nell? What's the matter?

01:14:47.017 --> 01:14:50.332
<i>I'm okay now, Shad.
I... I received a transmission.</i>

01:14:52.119 --> 01:14:52.971
What is it?

01:14:54.598 --> 01:14:56.808
<i>Zed the Corsair has ended.</i>

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:05.098
I'm sorry.

01:15:06.626 --> 01:15:09.176
<i>He was the last of the great ones.</i>

01:15:42.832 --> 01:15:46.050
Shad, did you see me on the monitor?

01:15:46.115 --> 01:15:48.325
There was a drone right on my tail.

01:15:48.721 --> 01:15:52.588
I pulled out and he
smashed into an asteroid!

01:15:54.919 --> 01:15:56.919
Let me tell you something.

01:15:58.699 --> 01:16:00.699
This may just be a game to you

01:16:02.596 --> 01:16:04.596
but these are my people.

01:16:12.953 --> 01:16:15.999
I'm sorry. I forgot about your Varda.

01:16:16.026 --> 01:16:19.924
I am from a warrior race.
We exist for battle.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.573
Our creed is to live fast, fight well
and have a beautiful ending.

01:16:24.805 --> 01:16:27.355
No violent ending is beautiful.

01:16:28.324 --> 01:16:31.044
You've never seen a Valkiri go down.

01:16:56.152 --> 01:16:57.222
Gelt.

01:17:01.246 --> 01:17:03.246
I had to move in.

01:17:04.366 --> 01:17:09.466
Half the universe trying to kill me
and I volunteered to be shot at.

01:17:09.509 --> 01:17:12.569
Just lie still. We've sent for a healer.

01:17:12.972 --> 01:17:14.972
What a place to end up.

01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:18.790
A minor planet in a third-rate galaxy.

01:17:43.988 --> 01:17:46.616
Have somebody prepare a meal.

01:17:46.646 --> 01:17:47.935
A meal?

01:17:48.558 --> 01:17:50.644
Full course, then bury it with him.

01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:52.635
Bury it?

01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:56.189
That was our arrangement.

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.740
A meal and a place to hide.

01:18:08.503 --> 01:18:11.478
The facet that was left here
has arranged to be captured.

01:18:12.434 --> 01:18:16.769
What one sees, all see.
We'll be getting a picture soon.

01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.580
Are you capable of speech?

01:18:24.855 --> 01:18:26.855
Yes, quite capable.

01:18:27.377 --> 01:18:28.346
Good!

01:18:29.503 --> 01:18:31.543
And do you have a high tolerance for pain?

01:18:32.355 --> 01:18:34.112
Almost none at all, I'm afraid.

01:18:34.151 --> 01:18:36.151
How unfortunate for you.

01:18:36.690 --> 01:18:38.900
How many ships do the Akira have

01:18:39.553 --> 01:18:42.771
and what are their capabilities?

01:18:43.896 --> 01:18:47.466
If I told you that, I would
give you an unfair advantage.

01:18:50.475 --> 01:18:53.545
This is my surgeon, Dako.

01:18:55.161 --> 01:18:58.842
Dako is expert at inflicting pain

01:19:00.454 --> 01:19:02.834
while keeping the patient alive.

01:19:04.105 --> 01:19:06.145
It's good to have skills.

01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:08.815
You won't give us the information?

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.475
No.

01:19:12.903 --> 01:19:14.903
I think you will.

01:19:15.717 --> 01:19:16.733
Dako.

01:19:17.733 --> 01:19:19.264
Lord Sador.

01:19:37.991 --> 01:19:43.015
It is true we cannot tolerate pain.
That facet has ended.

01:19:48.176 --> 01:19:50.902
He's dead, Lord Sador, yet he gave
no indication of terminating.

01:19:50.925 --> 01:19:52.106
Just give me the arm.

01:19:52.205 --> 01:19:54.205
The arm! Hurry!

01:20:13.547 --> 01:20:14.781
It is ready.

01:20:23.203 --> 01:20:24.867
You're an artist, Dako.

01:20:24.898 --> 01:20:26.851
- Thank you, Lord Sador.
- An artist.

01:20:28.685 --> 01:20:31.419
But when we conquer Akir
and we have some time...

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:34.635
you must do something about this.

01:20:41.949 --> 01:20:44.244
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, my Lord.

01:20:51.903 --> 01:20:52.652
I can't control my arm.

01:20:52.684 --> 01:20:57.059
- No! Lord Sador! No!
- I can't stop it!

01:21:03.293 --> 01:21:04.215
Drop the...

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:05.707
No!

01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:10.025
- Cut it! Cut it!
- We must!

01:21:10.245 --> 01:21:11.065
Hurry.

01:21:11.159 --> 01:21:13.354
- Now!
- Cut it!

01:21:13.794 --> 01:21:14.958
Cut the arm.

01:21:22.953 --> 01:21:24.481
We have failed.

01:21:27.031 --> 01:21:28.474
We've had it.

01:21:28.753 --> 01:21:32.151
The Valkiri never admit defeat, ever.

01:21:33.505 --> 01:21:35.130
I don't know about the rest.

01:21:38.561 --> 01:21:42.981
While life exists, the
possibilities are unlimited.

01:21:53.447 --> 01:21:54.611
Shad?

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:01.456
I never should've brought you here.

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:04.194
Your father was right.

01:22:04.505 --> 01:22:05.832
I want to go up there with you.

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:08.926
It's my life.

01:22:09.976 --> 01:22:12.356
I can risk it if I want to.

01:22:13.378 --> 01:22:16.778
Besides, I could help you up there.

01:22:21.767 --> 01:22:25.079
You know, I shouldn't say this...

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.245
But I really want you up there with me.

01:22:33.379 --> 01:22:34.731
I'm terrified.

01:22:36.554 --> 01:22:37.686
So am I.

01:22:39.769 --> 01:22:41.358
We'll be together.

01:22:42.437 --> 01:22:43.648
Okay?

01:22:46.406 --> 01:22:47.531
Okay.

01:22:59.893 --> 01:23:02.588
<i>Terrific. Now I've got
two babies to sit for.</i>

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.214
Nell, shut up.

01:23:17.948 --> 01:23:22.370
Prepare all ships for a full-scale attack.

01:23:24.188 --> 01:23:26.273
Make them burn.

01:23:27.696 --> 01:23:29.141
Burn!

01:25:41.436 --> 01:25:44.581
Nestor is hit. Repeat, Nestor is hit!

01:26:02.164 --> 01:26:06.844
Ready the stellar converter.
Fix on the planet Akir.

01:26:12.717 --> 01:26:15.068
He's bringing out the stellar converter.

01:26:23.159 --> 01:26:24.479
You pretty thing.

01:26:49.415 --> 01:26:52.587
Lower the force field and prepare to fire.

01:26:52.642 --> 01:26:55.212
- But sir, they...
- Lower the force field!

01:27:26.613 --> 01:27:28.222
Fire on the planet.

01:27:29.494 --> 01:27:31.062
I said fire.

01:27:31.076 --> 01:27:33.371
It won't fire. It has been damaged!

01:27:44.511 --> 01:27:47.443
I am St. Exmin of the Valkiri.

01:27:47.474 --> 01:27:49.623
It has been a very enjoyable fight.

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:05.638
"Live fast, fight well and
have a beautiful ending."

01:28:05.673 --> 01:28:10.571
All drones protect the formation.
Retreat behind the sun.

01:28:14.721 --> 01:28:16.814
Rotate engines 180 degrees.

01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:22.799
Well, well.

01:28:39.353 --> 01:28:42.525
Sador, this is Cayman of the Lambda Zone.

01:28:44.008 --> 01:28:48.178
Turn around, you overreached
degenerate and we'll bump heads.

01:28:50.423 --> 01:28:52.344
What do you make our force field at?

01:28:53.114 --> 01:28:54.557
10/6.

01:28:54.695 --> 01:28:56.351
And what do you make his at?

01:28:57.816 --> 01:29:00.621
It's an Elitrian Zimer. 10/2.

01:29:02.279 --> 01:29:04.551
Of what form are you, Cayman?

01:29:04.606 --> 01:29:06.392
I am of the Lazuli.

01:29:06.463 --> 01:29:11.244
I thought I had the honour of
making that form extinct long ago.

01:29:11.898 --> 01:29:14.108
I won't fail this time.

01:29:14.562 --> 01:29:18.233
Here I come, Cayman of the Lambda Zone.

01:29:39.814 --> 01:29:42.821
Sador, you son of a bitch.

01:29:42.906 --> 01:29:46.704
Here I come. This is Space Cowboy,
from the planet Earth.

01:30:25.636 --> 01:30:28.206
♪ String for my baby ♪

01:31:08.487 --> 01:31:10.487
About 30 seconds to impact.

01:31:31.871 --> 01:31:34.166
He didn't want to fight

01:31:35.406 --> 01:31:37.406
but it came anyway.

01:31:47.327 --> 01:31:56.584
Lazuli!

01:32:18.368 --> 01:32:22.806
I've gotta get him. He'll come back with
more ships. We'll never be done fighting.

01:32:22.869 --> 01:32:24.855
<i>I'm no match for his force field, Shad.</i>

01:32:24.887 --> 01:32:26.944
I don't care, Nell. I want a shot at him.

01:32:28.272 --> 01:32:30.272
If we go for him, he just might open up.

01:32:30.568 --> 01:32:31.513
Shad.

01:32:33.404 --> 01:32:35.404
Give me full thrust, Nell.

01:32:35.552 --> 01:32:39.207
<i>Think of Varda, Shad.
What is the first law of the Varda?</i>

01:32:46.649 --> 01:32:47.953
Don't worry. There's four of them.

01:32:48.003 --> 01:32:51.763
- Coming up on the left! Look out!
- Coming up on the left! Take me 3 points to the left, Nell.

01:32:52.681 --> 01:32:55.472
Roger. Take me two points to the right.
Two points to the right, Nell.

01:32:55.504 --> 01:32:57.043
Now drop me two. Drop me two!

01:33:02.731 --> 01:33:03.871
Shad, look!

01:33:05.309 --> 01:33:06.848
I got you now.

01:33:14.287 --> 01:33:15.271
Oh, no.

01:33:23.269 --> 01:33:25.269
Shad, are you all right?

01:33:28.155 --> 01:33:31.216
- I think so. Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

01:33:31.737 --> 01:33:33.737
Nell, what's your status?

01:33:34.873 --> 01:33:36.611
Damage report, Nell.

01:33:36.771 --> 01:33:38.817
<i>Um, what did you say?</i>

01:33:38.895 --> 01:33:40.379
Damage report, Nell.

01:33:40.729 --> 01:33:42.729
<i>Who's that?</i>

01:33:43.777 --> 01:33:45.777
You'd better check her functions.

01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:49.394
Nell, it's Shad. Are you damaged?

01:33:51.408 --> 01:33:53.846
<i>Shad? I don't know a Shad.</i>

01:33:53.931 --> 01:33:58.096
Her motor functions are intact, but I'm
getting nothing from her memory banks.

01:34:01.576 --> 01:34:03.022
<i>Who's that girl?</i>

01:34:03.053 --> 01:34:04.701
You'd better switch to manual.

01:34:04.722 --> 01:34:06.498
<i>Zed. Is Zed there?</i>

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.560
I'm switching to manual, Nell.

01:34:13.184 --> 01:34:15.066
It is the last one, sir.

01:34:17.076 --> 01:34:18.519
What is it?

01:34:19.002 --> 01:34:23.877
It's an old corsair. By the way
it moves we must've crippled it.

01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:26.705
Bring it in on the tractor beam.

01:34:27.973 --> 01:34:31.097
I want them taken aboard alive.

01:34:33.746 --> 01:34:36.910
Akir is mine.

01:34:51.784 --> 01:34:56.057
Damn it! Damn it, the guns are all locked off.
Nell, can you do anything at all?

01:34:56.096 --> 01:34:59.582
<i>I don't know. It's kind of fuzzy.
If I could just remember...</i>

01:34:59.636 --> 01:35:01.104
We can't let them take us.

01:35:01.142 --> 01:35:04.167
Don't worry. I'll blow the ship first.

01:35:07.092 --> 01:35:09.717
<i>The first law of Varda is...</i>

01:35:09.766 --> 01:35:13.563
First law of the Varda is to use
greater force against itself.

01:35:14.628 --> 01:35:18.159
Nanelia, watch the field sensors.

01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:23.961
And then reverse the thrusters.
We're going right for him.

01:35:39.075 --> 01:35:39.934
They...

01:35:40.583 --> 01:35:42.793
They have reversed thrusters.

01:35:43.838 --> 01:35:45.736
Just keep the beam on them.

01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:54.629
They'll be able to board us.

01:35:54.682 --> 01:35:56.221
It won't make any difference.

01:36:03.769 --> 01:36:06.276
There they are, at the forward deck.

01:36:06.308 --> 01:36:08.003
Get up there. I want them alive.

01:36:08.042 --> 01:36:09.011
Go!

01:36:09.441 --> 01:36:10.668
Let's go!

01:36:12.554 --> 01:36:15.253
Nell, I'm going to program
you to self-destruct.

01:36:15.277 --> 01:36:18.167
Maybe we can blow that converter back on.
Nanelia?

01:36:18.418 --> 01:36:19.551
Right, Shad.

01:36:19.589 --> 01:36:21.175
<i>We go back a long way, Zed.</i>

01:36:21.212 --> 01:36:22.493
Can you do it, Nell?

01:36:22.542 --> 01:36:26.315
<i>Sure. Just get yourselves into the
projectile and I'll shoot you out of here.</i>

01:36:26.378 --> 01:36:27.636
Projectile?

01:36:27.638 --> 01:36:30.183
<i>Don't think I'm gonna destruct
with you still inside here.</i>

01:36:30.211 --> 01:36:34.468
Get that hatch open. Now! Now!

01:36:34.499 --> 01:36:36.663
Just give us enough time
to get clear, Nell.

01:36:36.733 --> 01:36:37.889
And then let them have it.

01:36:37.918 --> 01:36:39.918
<i>30 seconds and counting, Zed.</i>

01:36:40.294 --> 01:36:43.561
<i>29, 28, 27,</i>

01:36:43.584 --> 01:36:47.052
<i>24, 15, 22...</i>

01:36:47.097 --> 01:36:48.917
<i>Did I... Did I say 15?</i>

01:36:48.949 --> 01:36:50.949
Why don't you just start from 10, Nell?

01:36:51.862 --> 01:36:55.940
<i>- So long, Zed.</i>
- So long, Nell.

01:36:56.038 --> 01:37:00.549
<i>9, 11, 13,</i>

01:37:00.588 --> 01:37:01.088
<i>14...</i>

01:37:06.018 --> 01:37:09.814
<i>15, 12, 9,</i>

01:37:13.596 --> 01:37:17.799
<i>14, 15, 16...</i>

01:37:24.331 --> 01:37:27.362
This is Sador of the Malmori.

01:37:27.930 --> 01:37:30.378
I command you to surrender.

01:37:31.221 --> 01:37:34.026
<i>I'll surrender, you sorry son of a mutant.</i>

01:37:34.643 --> 01:37:37.213
<i>5, 4...</i>

01:37:41.656 --> 01:37:44.039
Route it to the converter access.

01:37:44.054 --> 01:37:46.702
It's going to blow. We're all gonna die.

01:37:46.739 --> 01:37:48.765
That can't be.

01:37:48.823 --> 01:37:50.444
I'm going to live forever.

01:38:03.242 --> 01:38:05.281
I want to live forever.

01:38:21.265 --> 01:38:23.265
We did it.

01:38:24.156 --> 01:38:27.702
I can't believe it. We really did it.

01:38:32.449 --> 01:38:35.473
But St. Exmin, and Cowboy,

01:38:35.501 --> 01:38:37.196
Nanelia,

01:38:38.735 --> 01:38:45.961
The Akira believe that no form ends until all
the lives that it has touched are ended.

01:38:46.670 --> 01:38:49.390
Until all the good that
it has done is gone.

01:38:51.723 --> 01:38:53.763
They are now a part of Akir

01:38:55.682 --> 01:38:57.682
and they'll always be with us.
