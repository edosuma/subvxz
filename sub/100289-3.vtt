with your overhead lift.

03:33.671 --> 03:34.631

Pair skating is just so much different

with us, and I just...

26:03.436 --> 26:06.523
I want to make sure
that my actions don't screw it up.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.901
So, if I crossed a line yesterday,
I am sorry.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.529
Apology accepted.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.364
[Carol] Okay.

26:14.447 --> 26:17.033
And... I probably owe you one, too.

26:17.993 --> 26:18.994
I--

26:19.077 --> 26:20.704
I shouldn't have spoken to you like that.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.289
It's just, um...

26:23.456 --> 26:26.418
I'm sensitive when it comes
to eating issues with my students.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.545
My last skater had a really rough go.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.132
It was quite tragic.

26:32.674 --> 26:33.717
Okay, so, um...

26:35.385 --> 26:36.219
Anyway,

26:36.970 --> 26:39.347
you probably
don't want to talk about that.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.516
No. Please, I'm interested.

Hey, man. You didn't see Kat
at the rink today, did you?

27:04.164 --> 27:05.832
No. Is she supposed to be here?

27:05.915 --> 27:07.250
Yeah, she said she would.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.669
I have a really good idea.
Why don't we do a shot?

27:09.753 --> 27:12.172
-Do you want a shot?
-No, man. I gotta take it easy.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.214
I skate tomorrow.

No, man. Looks like she's not coming.
What the fuck's that about?

He just moved here from Boise.

[Justin] <i>What's wrong?</i>

40:40.229 --> 40:41.772
There was an accident.

40:44.650 --> 40:45.651
Your mom...

40:53.742 --> 40:55.786
[Dasha] I am so sorry.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.373
I am so sorry.

41:02.251 --> 41:03.419
Oh, God.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.275
It is harder when you care.

41:28.777 --> 41:31.363
And you haven't cared
for a very long time.

41:38.204 --> 41:39.580
I don't know what you mean.

41:56.138 --> 41:57.223
I'm sorry.

41:59.391 --> 42:00.309
Good.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.439
You know I'd never let you fall, right?

42:16.367 --> 42:17.368
[Dasha claps] Okay.

42:18.118 --> 42:19.119
Fresh start, guys.

42:19.578 --> 42:21.539
Come on. Let us try another lift.

42:23.040 --> 42:26.001
One more chance.
This time with choreography.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.549
Come on, guys. Be together.

42:34.510 --> 42:37.137
Yes, good! Pick up the speed.
