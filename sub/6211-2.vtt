(clock cuckoos)

00:05.738 --> 00:07.639
13:00?

00:07.640 --> 00:09.774
I'm late.

00:09.842 --> 00:11.342
Aunt Zelda...

00:11.411 --> 00:13.011
Aunt Zelda...

00:15.615 --> 00:16.715
Oh.

00:18.584 --> 00:19.885
Sorry.

00:19.952 --> 00:21.286
Why the pod of privacy?

00:21.354 --> 00:23.921
Because that stupid clock
of Hilda's is driving me...

00:23.989 --> 00:25.490
(clock cuckooing)

00:25.557 --> 00:26.525
Exactly.

00:26.592 --> 00:27.726
Hilda's pretending

00:27.793 --> 00:29.761
that piece of junk
doesn't bother her,

00:29.829 --> 00:32.363
but this is one girl
who can out-pretend her.

00:32.430 --> 00:34.899
Oh, so you two have finally
outgrown staring contests.

00:34.966 --> 00:37.235
(cuckooing)

00:37.302 --> 00:39.204
I knew that noise
would get to you.

00:39.271 --> 00:40.271
Blow it up, baby.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.849 --> 00:50.915
Bad
audition?

00:50.983 --> 00:53.084
My life needs
a new direction.

00:53.152 --> 00:55.086
I'm only 620 years old.

00:55.153 --> 00:57.856
I need something
more stimulating.

00:57.923 --> 01:00.058
ZELDA:
Well, if you've grown tired
of the violin,

01:00.126 --> 01:02.327
perhaps a career
change is a good idea.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.328
Let me offer you
a suggestion...

01:03.395 --> 01:04.429
(clock cuckoos)

01:04.495 --> 01:05.896
Fix that infernal clock!

01:05.964 --> 01:07.165
Zelda, face it.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.700
You're the only one
that it bothers.

01:09.768 --> 01:13.104
(clock chirps and chimes
out of synch and off-key)

01:13.172 --> 01:14.539
(clock is silent)

01:14.607 --> 01:15.874
Salem...

01:15.941 --> 01:17.175
did you break my brand-new

01:17.243 --> 01:19.577
handmade-in-Indonesia
Swiss cuckoo clock?

01:19.645 --> 01:20.445
(coughing)

01:20.512 --> 01:21.679
Cuckoo...

01:21.747 --> 01:23.414

01:59.818 --> 02:01.486
Oh, another protest?

02:01.554 --> 02:03.087
Good grief,
you stage one little rally

02:03.155 --> 02:04.689
against mildew
in the locker room

02:04.756 --> 02:06.424
and suddenly,
you're Che Guevara.

02:06.492 --> 02:08.193
"Westbridge Through
the Years."

02:08.259 --> 02:10.261
Well, clearly, very
little has happened

02:10.329 --> 02:12.063
in Westbridge
through the years.

02:12.131 --> 02:13.097
Well, it's not finished yet.

02:13.165 --> 02:14.733
I want to be editor
of the yearbook

02:14.800 --> 02:15.966
and this is my audition page.

02:17.236 --> 02:18.937
A little maternal oohing
and ahing

02:19.004 --> 02:20.304
might be appropriate now.

02:20.372 --> 02:21.939
Sabrina, it might not be
a good idea

02:22.008 --> 02:24.242
to take on too many
extra activities this year.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.110
Don't worry, Aunt Zelda,
I've taken on

02:26.178 --> 02:28.446
a new can-do attitude
for my senior year.

02:28.513 --> 02:30.081
Well, that's good,
because this arrived

02:30.149 --> 02:31.883
from the Witches
Council this morning.

02:31.951 --> 02:32.917
I've been chosen

02:32.984 --> 02:34.619
to mentor a witch student
this year?

02:34.686 --> 02:36.587
Yes, you have to guide
and teach another witch,

02:36.655 --> 02:38.256
so they can get
their witch's license.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.492
I have
to be somebody's Quiz Master?

02:40.559 --> 02:41.425
No, mentor.

02:41.493 --> 02:42.526
What's the difference?

02:42.594 --> 02:44.395
Quiz Masters get paid.

02:44.463 --> 02:45.696
Fine.

02:45.764 --> 02:48.066
I can help mold and shape
someone's young mind

02:48.133 --> 02:49.634
and make him get me coffee.

02:49.701 --> 02:50.668
I like it.

02:50.736 --> 02:51.969
I'm off to
the clock shop.

02:52.037 --> 02:53.971
God, she really loves
that clock, huh?

02:54.039 --> 02:55.005
I know.

02:55.073 --> 02:56.408
Sad.

02:56.475 --> 02:57.742
What you protesting?

03:04.316 --> 03:06.818
<i>Not</i> another protest,
Miss Spellman.

03:06.885 --> 03:08.152
If we were in China,

03:08.220 --> 03:10.522
I could run you over
with a tank.

03:10.589 --> 03:11.523
This isn't a protest.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.692
It's my audition page
for yearbook editor.

03:13.759 --> 03:15.593
See, "Westbridge
Through the Years."

03:15.661 --> 03:17.729
I'm going to put pictures
of past yearbooks here...

03:17.797 --> 03:20.732
The theme of the yearbook
is the same every year.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.133
It is a bound chronicle

03:22.201 --> 03:24.535
of the misery
that I've been put through

03:24.603 --> 03:26.537
during the previous
nine months.

03:26.605 --> 03:27.939
Okay, now
I'm protesting.

03:28.006 --> 03:30.975
Mr. Garcia,
get the water hose.

03:31.043 --> 03:32.310
Come on, Mr. Kraft.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.379
I know this may strike you
as a walk on the wild side,

03:34.447 --> 03:35.713
but how about giving
me a little support?

03:35.781 --> 03:36.982
Well, since I'm the head

03:37.049 --> 03:39.550
of the faculty committee that
selects the yearbook editor,

03:39.618 --> 03:40.718
you'll need it.

03:40.786 --> 03:42.086
Okay, somewhere
along the way,

03:42.154 --> 03:44.255
this conversation
went terribly wrong.

03:44.323 --> 03:47.925
I <i>live</i> for days
like this.

03:49.094 --> 03:49.994
Oh!
Oops!

03:50.061 --> 03:51.262
Excuse me.

03:51.329 --> 03:53.197
Hey, um, did you write me
the letter of recommendation

03:53.265 --> 03:54.365
for yearbook editor?

03:54.433 --> 03:56.100
Okay, bro, here's
the question.

03:56.168 --> 03:57.368
New NFL franchise--

03:57.436 --> 03:58.570
who do you pick?

03:58.637 --> 03:59.737
Barry Sanders.

03:59.805 --> 04:01.238
You're brain-dead.

04:01.306 --> 04:03.074
Hello? Letter of recommendation?

04:03.142 --> 04:04.141
I'm sorry, Sabrina.

04:04.210 --> 04:06.411
Last night kind of got away
from me.

04:06.478 --> 04:09.514
We're starting
a new fantasy football league.

04:09.581 --> 04:11.082
And I can't tell you
how excited I am about that.

04:11.150 --> 04:12.049
I need the letter.

04:12.117 --> 04:13.250
I'll get right on it.

04:13.318 --> 04:14.719
Thanks.

04:14.786 --> 04:17.788
With that and Mr. Kraft's
sudden death due to smallpox,

04:17.856 --> 04:19.055
I might make editor.

04:26.365 --> 04:29.100
No!

04:33.905 --> 04:35.139
Sorry.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.311
You should be
more careful.

04:40.378 --> 04:41.612
I'm Dreama...

04:41.680 --> 04:42.947
(bell rings)

04:43.015 --> 04:44.015
and I'm late.

04:44.082 --> 04:46.250
Good luck with whatever
you're protesting.

04:46.318 --> 04:47.452
Power to the people.

04:49.321 --> 04:51.155
You know,
I love the violin.

04:51.223 --> 04:52.724
But you can only play
so much Mozart

04:52.792 --> 04:54.959
until you start
to be glad he died <i>young.</i>

04:55.027 --> 04:56.794
Mmm. Travel clock,
on the house.

04:56.862 --> 04:59.631
So, now I want
to do something bolder--

04:59.698 --> 05:02.267
more imaginative,
more challenging.

05:02.334 --> 05:03.368
Want to buy
this place?

05:03.436 --> 05:05.170
Really?
Sure.

05:05.237 --> 05:10.108
Wow, I... never really
imagined myself as a merchant.

05:10.175 --> 05:12.477
Could I interest you
in an alarm clock?

05:12.544 --> 05:13.544
Ha!

05:13.612 --> 05:15.180
By golly, I'll do it.

05:15.214 --> 05:16.414
(chuckles)

05:18.483 --> 05:20.952
Hey, where are
you going?

05:21.020 --> 05:23.488
I'm going to buy a bar.

05:23.556 --> 05:24.722
Wow...

05:24.790 --> 05:26.724
talk about impulsive.

05:26.792 --> 05:29.727
Hey, did you write that letter
of recommendation at lunch?

05:29.795 --> 05:30.762
Ate lunch at lunch.

05:30.763 --> 05:31.996
And to tell
you the truth,

05:32.063 --> 05:33.865
the thought of writing
it's giving me

05:33.933 --> 05:34.966
a knot in my stomach.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.868
Oh, that's
just the fish cakes.

05:36.936 --> 05:38.603
Don't worry,
it's just a little letter.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.137
Nothing to feel
pressured about.

05:40.205 --> 05:42.173
I need it by tomorrow
<i>or all is lost!</i>

05:55.487 --> 05:57.188
Hi, there.
Remember me?

05:57.256 --> 06:00.191
Uh... I'm having flashbacks
as we speak.

06:00.259 --> 06:01.125
Okay.

06:01.192 --> 06:04.128
What is the integral
of the sine function

06:04.196 --> 06:06.030
of minus pi to pi,
anyone?

06:06.097 --> 06:07.164
Oh!

06:07.232 --> 06:08.633
Zero, because sine is

06:08.701 --> 06:09.934
an odd function

06:10.002 --> 06:12.203
and the negative area
cancels out the positive area.

06:12.271 --> 06:14.838
Sabrina... could you, uh,
get yourself organized,

06:14.906 --> 06:17.608
so you could participate
in the class, please?

06:17.676 --> 06:18.575
Yes, sir.

06:18.643 --> 06:20.411
ZELDA:
<i>You</i> what?

06:20.479 --> 06:21.379
I bought a
clock shop.

06:21.446 --> 06:22.713
Which clock shop?

06:22.781 --> 06:23.748
The one down
by the market.

06:23.816 --> 06:24.749
That shop?

06:24.816 --> 06:26.551
It's in
a terrible location.

06:26.619 --> 06:27.519
No, it's not.

06:27.586 --> 06:28.886
Took me five
minutes to find.

06:28.954 --> 06:31.856
In the last two years,
that same spot has been

06:31.923 --> 06:34.726
a karate school, a nail salon,
a yogurt shop,

06:34.793 --> 06:37.395
another nail salon,
a Chinese restaurant

06:37.463 --> 06:40.831
and a combination Chinese
restaurant and nail salon.

06:40.899 --> 06:43.133
So, what you're saying
is if things go well,

06:43.201 --> 06:44.769
I could sublet
to a psychic.

06:46.571 --> 06:49.473
Hilda, <i>all</i> those shops failed.

06:49.541 --> 06:51.242
Well, mine isn't going to fail.

06:51.309 --> 06:54.245
Mine is going to be a gigantic,
colossal success.

06:54.313 --> 06:57.248
I am going to be the Rolex
of the clock world.

06:57.316 --> 06:59.350
You don't know the first thing
about clocks.

06:59.417 --> 07:02.019
I know <i>tons</i>
about clocks.

07:02.087 --> 07:03.087
What time is it?

07:03.154 --> 07:04.121
8:40.

07:04.189 --> 07:05.689
It's ten after 2:00.

07:05.757 --> 07:09.493
All right. So I put my
watch on upside-down, okay?

07:09.561 --> 07:11.495
And it's 8:40 <i>somewhere.</i>

07:12.864 --> 07:13.931
Hi, there.

07:13.999 --> 07:15.133
Hi back.

07:16.601 --> 07:18.636
I've had days like that.

07:18.704 --> 07:21.973
You <i>are</i> a day like that.

07:22.041 --> 07:23.141
(sighs)

07:29.648 --> 07:30.949
What was that?

07:31.016 --> 07:31.882
Oh, uh...

07:31.950 --> 07:33.217
stomach rumble.

07:33.285 --> 07:35.119
I had the fish cakes.

07:38.156 --> 07:39.390
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.259
Don't get interested
in her, son.

07:41.326 --> 07:42.793
That girl is poison.

07:42.861 --> 07:46.097
Yeah, there <i>is</i> something strange
about her, isn't there...

07:46.164 --> 07:47.331
something weird.

07:47.399 --> 07:49.200
Hey, you know,
I like you, boy.

07:49.268 --> 07:52.036
You know the best way
to fit into a new school,

07:52.104 --> 07:55.339
other than just being, you
know, Dano to my McGarrett?

07:55.407 --> 07:57.107
Extracurricular
activities...

07:57.176 --> 07:58.609
and just at the moment,

07:58.677 --> 08:01.178
we are desperate to find a
new editor for our yearbook.

08:01.246 --> 08:03.381
Oh, wow,
I might be interested

08:03.415 --> 08:04.448
in a job like that.

08:04.516 --> 08:06.117
Oh, that's great.

08:06.185 --> 08:09.586
Fine. Put the new kid
in charge of our memories.

08:10.622 --> 08:11.823
<i>So, Harvey's going to bring</i>

08:11.890 --> 08:13.124
his parents' old yearbooks

08:13.192 --> 08:15.226
and I'm going to put pictures
of old Westbridge students here.

08:15.294 --> 08:17.227
And these pictures
are being brought
by the same Harvey

08:17.295 --> 08:19.030
who can't remember
to write a letter.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.665
You know, this editor thing
is really important to me.

08:21.733 --> 08:24.035
So, would you put a sock in it,
Sergeant Negative?

08:24.103 --> 08:26.270
Aye, aye, Captain Deluded.

08:26.338 --> 08:27.305
(doorbell rings)

08:27.373 --> 08:28.673
Hey,
maybe that's my witch student.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.174
(laughing)

08:30.241 --> 08:32.243
You're going to teach
some poor kid how to do mag...

08:32.311 --> 08:33.610
(laughing)

08:33.678 --> 08:36.212
I think it's marvelous.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.414
ZELDA:
Sabrina,

08:37.482 --> 08:38.582
your witch student is here.

08:38.650 --> 08:39.717
SABRINA:
Coming.

08:39.784 --> 08:41.952
Don't get smart with me, mister.

08:42.020 --> 08:42.687
(goofy gasp)

08:42.755 --> 08:43.921
Just practicing.

08:43.989 --> 08:44.856
Hmm...

08:45.857 --> 08:47.024
It's a girl.

08:47.092 --> 08:48.826
Oh, good, 'cause fish
are so hard to train.

08:48.894 --> 08:50.294
She's in there.

08:51.463 --> 08:53.898
Dreama? You're
my student?!

08:53.966 --> 08:55.199
And you're my teacher?

08:55.267 --> 08:55.967
This is incredible.

08:56.034 --> 08:57.801
I'm so lucky.

08:57.869 --> 08:58.870
(vase shatters)

08:58.937 --> 09:00.071
Can I please go back

09:00.139 --> 09:02.173
to working on
the family secret?

09:05.677 --> 09:08.012
I got you a present.

09:09.148 --> 09:11.715
Oh, dear, that was supposed
to be flowers.

09:11.783 --> 09:13.784
That's okay.
We don't have a vase.

09:14.786 --> 09:15.886
Here, dear.
Dreama's parents

09:15.954 --> 09:17.588
moved her here from
the Other Realm,

09:17.656 --> 09:18.922
so that you
could help her.

09:18.990 --> 09:20.358
She's a very
bright girl,

09:20.425 --> 09:22.025
but she's neglected
her magic.

09:23.996 --> 09:26.063
Great! Um, Aunt Zelda,

09:26.131 --> 09:28.299
can I speak to you
in private for a moment?

09:30.235 --> 09:31.769
Remember my
can-do attitude?

09:31.903 --> 09:33.137
Gone! She's a walking disaster.

09:33.205 --> 09:34.238
The Witches Council

09:34.272 --> 09:36.073
will have to pull
another name out of the hat.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.875
Dreama wasn't chosen
for you at random.

09:37.942 --> 09:39.377
Her name came from

09:39.444 --> 09:41.412
an intricately constructed
scientific hat.

09:43.849 --> 09:44.949
I can't work with her.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.617
Can't you see?
She'll kill me!

09:46.684 --> 09:48.653
Sabrina, it's
a mandate from
the Other Realm.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.220
You have to improve
Dreama's magic

09:50.288 --> 09:52.590
or you'll lose your
witch's license
and be deported.

09:52.658 --> 09:56.760
Well, it's something new and
horrible every day, isn't it?

09:58.630 --> 10:00.131
The Mortal Realm
is so different

10:00.198 --> 10:01.132
from the Other Realm.

10:01.199 --> 10:02.266
I hope I can fit in.

10:02.334 --> 10:03.768
Okay, there are a couple
of things to remember.

10:03.836 --> 10:05.503
One: I worked very hard
to get my witch's license.

10:05.570 --> 10:06.938
Two: it means a lot to me.

10:07.005 --> 10:08.805
Three: I have a hard
enough time covering
my own tracks,

10:08.873 --> 10:09.907
let alone trying
to cover yours.

10:09.975 --> 10:11.442
And four or five
or wherever I am:

10:11.443 --> 10:13.377
no magic in front of mortals.

10:13.412 --> 10:14.278
Okay, got it.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.215
Hey! I don't care what you did
at your old school.

10:18.283 --> 10:20.250
Here we do not celebrate
Firecracker Tuesday.

10:20.352 --> 10:22.486
So you meant magic of any sort?

10:24.890 --> 10:27.124
Harvey! Hey, did you bring
the old yearbooks?

10:27.191 --> 10:28.726
Uh-oh.

10:28.793 --> 10:30.628
Well, did you at least write
the letter of recommendation?

10:30.696 --> 10:33.464
Oh, man, Brad came over

10:33.532 --> 10:35.966
and we rated every
defensive back in the NFL.

10:36.034 --> 10:37.335
Salem was right.

10:37.402 --> 10:38.235
Your cat?

10:38.303 --> 10:39.203
Don't change the subject.

10:39.271 --> 10:40.637
I'll get the books at lunch,

10:40.705 --> 10:41.672
I promise.

10:42.441 --> 10:43.775
Well, at least I know

10:43.842 --> 10:45.209
that if Harvey was out
with Brad last night,

10:45.277 --> 10:47.377
Brad couldn't have worked
on his yearbook proposal.

10:47.445 --> 10:51.048
Mr. Alcerro. Now, this is
what I call a proposal.

10:51.116 --> 10:52.517
I'll say. Whose is...?

10:52.584 --> 10:54.284
Nice work, Bradley.

10:54.352 --> 10:56.787
Yes. You know, it's
reassuring to see

10:56.855 --> 10:59.924
that some students can get
their proposals in on time.

11:00.025 --> 11:03.494
If I were you, I would
start sharpening my
editor's pencil.

11:05.964 --> 11:07.465
(phone ringing)

11:07.533 --> 11:09.333
Hello?

11:09.401 --> 11:10.534
Hi, so I was wondering...

11:10.602 --> 11:12.303
are you ever going
to come down to my shop?

11:12.370 --> 11:14.405
In other words,
you're in way over your head

11:14.473 --> 11:16.874
and you need me to come
down there and rescue you.

11:16.941 --> 11:19.577
Something vaguely like that.

11:19.645 --> 11:22.480
(all clamoring)

11:27.085 --> 11:29.186
So we're not supposed to use
our magic to do schoolwork,

11:29.254 --> 11:30.854
even though you're a witch?

11:30.923 --> 11:33.024
Hey, I thought
we promised Dr. Fishman

11:33.091 --> 11:35.092
we weren't going
to name call.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.326
Listen, here's another
rule you need to know

11:36.394 --> 11:37.895
if you're going to survive
in the Mortal Realm:

11:37.963 --> 11:39.730
never ever let a mortal
know that you're a witch.

11:39.798 --> 11:42.200
Okay, but who's Dr. Fishman?

11:43.134 --> 11:46.370
Yeah, this is
a nice proposal.

11:46.438 --> 11:48.505
I wish Brad would
move back to Texas.

11:55.446 --> 11:58.215
I'm assuming you
meant to send
Brad to Texas.

11:58.283 --> 11:59.717
Well, while we're here,

11:59.785 --> 12:01.652
you want to rustle up
some grub?

12:06.424 --> 12:08.993
Where did you come from?

12:09.060 --> 12:11.429
I really think
you need to have

12:11.496 --> 12:14.698
that conversation
with your parents.

12:14.766 --> 12:17.568
What did I say about magic
in front of mortals--

12:17.635 --> 12:19.036
especially bad magic?

12:19.103 --> 12:20.804
I'm sorry, I've been doing this
all my life.

12:20.872 --> 12:22.072
I pull before I think.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.141
I've got to get to health class.

12:24.209 --> 12:27.011
Mrs. Quick won't mind
if I leave this here.

12:27.078 --> 12:28.779
Sit!

12:28.847 --> 12:30.247
Stay!

12:35.920 --> 12:39.090
All Sabrina needs to do
is fill in these blank spots

12:39.158 --> 12:41.858
with high school students
from the past.

12:41.926 --> 12:44.561
There's no mortals around.

12:44.629 --> 12:47.631
To finish her poster
of Westbridge High,

12:47.699 --> 12:50.834
bring me the students
of years gone by.

12:53.305 --> 12:54.672
Where are we?

12:56.140 --> 12:57.174
Where's the radio?

12:57.242 --> 12:59.176
We were listening
to Jack Benny.

12:59.244 --> 13:01.479
Uh-oh.

13:01.546 --> 13:04.315
I'll have that fixed for you
by Monday.

13:04.383 --> 13:06.350
(bell jingling)

13:09.220 --> 13:11.689
Oh! I just didn't say
which Monday.

13:11.757 --> 13:13.657
Bet you're kicking yourself
now that you didn't get

13:13.725 --> 13:15.792
a piece of this place
when you had the chance.

13:15.860 --> 13:18.362
You cannot possibly run
this place by yourself

13:18.429 --> 13:20.264
and I am not coming down here

13:20.331 --> 13:21.832
every day to help you.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.868
Okay, 25%.

13:24.536 --> 13:25.903
That's my final offer.

13:27.072 --> 13:30.841
Oh! What a <i>great</i>
grandfather clock.

13:30.909 --> 13:32.610
Well, actually,
it's a grandfather clock,

13:32.678 --> 13:34.478
but it appears to be
a great one.

13:34.546 --> 13:36.213
There's something odd
about this clock.

13:36.281 --> 13:37.615
What? That it
actually works?

13:37.682 --> 13:39.183
Let's check out
the guts inside.

13:39.218 --> 13:41.685
No, wait!

13:41.753 --> 13:43.854
(gasping)

13:43.921 --> 13:45.556
Oh!

13:45.624 --> 13:48.125
Now I see why that guy
wanted all cash.

13:48.192 --> 13:49.760
(sighing)

13:49.828 --> 13:51.395
Psst!

14:01.706 --> 14:05.109
Two minutes walking around
and my leg should wake up.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.378
You did magic, didn't you?

14:07.445 --> 14:09.546
You think this has anything
to do with the war?

14:09.614 --> 14:11.414
Where am I?

14:11.482 --> 14:13.284
(gasping):
Who are you?

14:13.351 --> 14:14.852
Hilda, I hope
you're happy.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.255
You bought a magical
lost-in-time clock.

14:17.322 --> 14:20.157
Well, how was I
supposed to know that
that's what it was?

14:20.225 --> 14:22.426
"Lost-in-time clock.

14:22.493 --> 14:25.462
"Persons who come through
this clock are lost in time.

14:25.530 --> 14:27.331
"Whoever opens this
portal must assist

14:27.399 --> 14:30.635
"the time-traveler
or be turned into
a clock themselves.

14:30.702 --> 14:33.503
No excuses, no exceptions,
this means you."

14:33.571 --> 14:36.807
Well, I guess that's what
they mean by "buyer beware."

14:36.874 --> 14:40.144
They said these things
were safe.

14:40.211 --> 14:41.945
Well, now what do we do?
I'm not sure.

14:42.013 --> 14:44.715
See? You don't know
any more about running
a clock shop than I do.

14:46.584 --> 14:48.185
Hello.
Hello.

14:48.253 --> 14:50.354
You've got to reverse
the spell.

14:50.422 --> 14:51.922
I-I don't know how.

14:51.990 --> 14:52.589
Let me try.

14:55.026 --> 14:55.893
You don't know
how to reverse your spells,

14:55.960 --> 14:57.027
but you know how to seal them.

14:57.095 --> 14:58.395
This isn't good news, is it?

15:00.699 --> 15:02.966
I've read about
lost-in-time people before.

15:03.034 --> 15:05.469
They made a big mistake
somewhere in their lives

15:05.470 --> 15:08.105
and they have to go back
so they can correct it.

15:08.173 --> 15:11.809
Okay, Billy, what was
the last thing that
you remember doing?

15:11.877 --> 15:13.310
Well, let's see, uh...

15:13.378 --> 15:16.013
I was in the big game,
I was running for a pass

15:16.081 --> 15:17.948
and I noticed my shoe
was untied.

15:18.016 --> 15:19.016
That must be it.

15:19.083 --> 15:19.616
Right.

15:21.686 --> 15:24.621
Okay, Billy, go
back and this
time, don't trip.

15:29.728 --> 15:32.796
Oh, not as easy
as it looks.

15:32.864 --> 15:34.698
We've got to get to my aunts.

15:34.766 --> 15:36.500
Let's make a break for it.

15:39.937 --> 15:41.305
Halt!

15:42.340 --> 15:44.675
That's detention
for everyone...

15:44.743 --> 15:47.744
including George and
Mary Bailey here.

15:47.812 --> 15:49.947
They're part
of my yearbook proposal.

15:50.015 --> 15:50.981
You know, a live 3-D

15:51.049 --> 15:52.650
interactive presentation

15:52.717 --> 15:54.952
with kids
from the Westbridge players.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.621
I don't like it.

15:57.688 --> 15:59.856
Oh, well, then, I guess
we'll have to return

15:59.924 --> 16:01.858
the costumes
to the costume shop.

16:03.862 --> 16:06.463
And the fact that we
don't have a costume shop

16:06.530 --> 16:08.098
doesn't even bother me.

16:17.542 --> 16:18.975
Okay, the
glue is on.

16:19.043 --> 16:21.945
Thank goodness he remembered
dropping that pass.

16:22.013 --> 16:25.783
Okay, Billy, go back
there and this time,
win one for the gipper!

16:32.224 --> 16:34.992
All right, well, we have
that spare bedroom, don't we?

16:35.060 --> 16:37.961
(bell jingling)

16:38.029 --> 16:40.063
Oh, it's Sabrina
and Dreama.

16:40.132 --> 16:42.499
HILDA:
And two weird kids.

16:44.102 --> 16:47.270
I've got a big problem.

16:47.338 --> 16:48.438
Cirque du Soleil?

16:48.506 --> 16:49.373
Football player.

16:49.441 --> 16:50.674
He came through the clock.

16:50.741 --> 16:52.742
So I can speak freely.

16:56.414 --> 16:58.115
Oh, no, it's Brad. Oh!

16:58.182 --> 16:59.383
You know, you could help me

16:59.451 --> 17:00.718
send these people
back to their homes

17:00.785 --> 17:02.486
or you could help me fight
the Witches Council

17:02.587 --> 17:03.754
in a fiery,
apocalyptic showdown.

17:03.821 --> 17:05.088
Whatever works for you.

17:05.156 --> 17:06.423
We've got a little problem.

17:06.491 --> 17:07.523
Brad's outside.

17:07.592 --> 17:09.059
Brad?!
Gretchen?

17:09.127 --> 17:09.726
Billy?

17:09.794 --> 17:10.960
You know each other?

17:11.028 --> 17:12.195
We were in love,

17:12.263 --> 17:14.031
but I decided to
play in the big game

17:14.098 --> 17:16.200
instead of taking her
out for her birthday.

17:16.268 --> 17:18.002
So I went out
with John instead.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.237
And you never thought about
going out after the game?

17:20.305 --> 17:21.805
ZELDA:
Billy!

17:21.873 --> 17:23.440
That's why
you're lost in time.

17:23.508 --> 17:25.409
You've got to go back,
skip the game

17:25.477 --> 17:26.943
and be with your girl.

17:27.011 --> 17:28.812
And you've got
to go out there
and make sure Brad

17:28.880 --> 17:30.948
doesn't come back here.
Just show him some clocks.

17:31.015 --> 17:32.683
Yeah, but if you sell
one, no commission.

17:32.751 --> 17:35.386
Now, let's let these
guys 23-skidoo.

17:35.453 --> 17:37.488
Hilda, that's the '20s.

17:37.555 --> 17:39.957
Sorry, it looks
like you lose out.

17:40.024 --> 17:41.758
Well, that's okay.

17:41.826 --> 17:45.895
If you ever find yourself
in 1946, look me up.

17:47.899 --> 17:49.166
Toodle-oo.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.768
Buy bonds.

17:51.836 --> 17:53.804
Okay, so we've sent
three very confused people

17:53.905 --> 17:55.572
back home through a clock.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.741
Now all I have to do
is come up with an
excuse for Brad.

17:57.809 --> 17:59.777
Hilda, do you feel strange?

17:59.844 --> 18:01.178
Definitely.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.514
What's that?

18:04.582 --> 18:05.783
This Brad is the boy

18:05.850 --> 18:07.984
who dislikes you
for no apparent reason?

18:08.052 --> 18:08.551
That's right.

18:08.619 --> 18:10.720
(gasps):
Bingo!

18:10.788 --> 18:12.389
Witch hunter!

18:12.457 --> 18:14.124
As in "hunts witches"?

18:14.192 --> 18:16.860
A very small amount of
mortals are born with
a witch-hunting gene

18:16.928 --> 18:19.063
that makes them want
to ferret out witches.

18:19.130 --> 18:21.465
Something new and horrible--
right on time.

18:21.566 --> 18:24.468
Okay, so Harvey's best friend
is trying to out me?

18:24.535 --> 18:26.003
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

18:26.071 --> 18:28.305
He just senses magic
and it makes him suspicious.

18:28.372 --> 18:30.508
Yeah, the real danger
comes when a witch

18:30.575 --> 18:33.143
inadvertently reveals
herself to a witch hunter.

18:33.211 --> 18:36.213
Then you get turned
into a mouse for
a hundred years.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.614
So we have to
be very careful.

18:37.682 --> 18:39.316
Oh, well, we're always careful

18:39.384 --> 18:41.518
and we'd never do magic
around... Dreama!

18:45.190 --> 18:48.591
Maybe they're next door
at the Beef Bowl.

18:50.195 --> 18:51.395
No Dreama.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.563
Good-bye license.

18:53.631 --> 18:55.198
Good-bye home.

18:55.266 --> 18:56.533
Witch hunter!
(whistling)

18:56.601 --> 18:57.467
Give me her!

18:57.535 --> 18:59.302
What?

18:59.370 --> 19:01.604
I'm so sorry.

19:01.672 --> 19:03.907
Miss Spellman, do I have to add

19:03.975 --> 19:06.376
crimes against nature
to your dossier?

19:06.444 --> 19:07.611
I...

19:07.679 --> 19:09.180
Dreama! Thank goodness.

19:09.247 --> 19:10.514
Who am I holding?

19:10.582 --> 19:11.815
My science project.

19:11.883 --> 19:13.083
Note the tumor.

19:13.151 --> 19:14.785
KRAFT:
You will be
happy to learn

19:14.852 --> 19:19.289
the detention hall now serves
a continental breakfast.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.726
Your girlfriend is weird.

19:22.794 --> 19:24.194
I know.

19:25.997 --> 19:28.432
I've been looking for you
for, like, an hour.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.200
I have a pager.

19:30.268 --> 19:33.137
Here's your vintage yearbooks

19:33.204 --> 19:36.006
and my heartfelt letter
of recommendation.

19:36.074 --> 19:37.340
You really wrote it?

19:37.408 --> 19:39.176
With a little encouragement
from Dreama.

19:39.244 --> 19:41.945
She sat me down and told me
to just write what I feel.

19:42.012 --> 19:44.514
The first three drafts
were about my stomachache,

19:44.582 --> 19:47.017
but this last one's
straight from the heart.

19:47.085 --> 19:49.119
"Sabrina Spellman
is the nicest, smartest,

19:49.187 --> 19:51.187
"most imaginative person
I've ever met.

19:51.255 --> 19:54.123
Pick her as yearbook editor
and watch her work her magic."

19:54.191 --> 19:55.893
Oh, Harvey.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.594
(bell rings)

19:57.662 --> 20:00.998
Life's great when you're
not annoyed with me.

20:01.065 --> 20:04.434
So, you annoyed with me?

20:04.502 --> 20:06.503
You know, you're not
very good with your magic,

20:06.571 --> 20:08.171
but you're a
pretty good friend.

20:09.240 --> 20:11.675
All this excitement
has made me thirsty.

20:11.743 --> 20:15.078
No!

20:15.146 --> 20:18.848
<i>Let's go over the rules</i> again.

20:23.254 --> 20:24.120
Well?

20:24.188 --> 20:27.090
Well, Brad made yearbook editor.

20:27.158 --> 20:28.491
We can turn him
into a chicken.

20:28.559 --> 20:29.660
Well, that's okay.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.795
I'll have plenty to do
mentoring Dreama.

20:31.863 --> 20:33.430
Did you get your clock fixed?

20:33.497 --> 20:34.497
Of course.

20:34.565 --> 20:35.933
I run a clock shop.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.935
Since Hilda has
absolutely no

20:38.002 --> 20:39.669
experience
fixing things,

20:39.737 --> 20:41.805
we had to improvise
a little.

20:41.873 --> 20:43.774
I'm not doing this all night.

20:43.842 --> 20:45.642
I'm not working weekends.

20:45.710 --> 20:47.578
I'm taking holidays off.

20:47.645 --> 20:48.579
Salem...

20:48.646 --> 20:50.113
Cuckoo.

20:51.305 --> 20:57.396
