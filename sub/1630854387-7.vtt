00:07.966 --> 00:12.220
[cultists] Azarath.
Metrion. Zinthos.

00:12.220 --> 00:28.486
Azarath. Metrion. Zinthos.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.408
[chanting stops]

00:33.408 --> 00:34.909
[liquid bubbling]

01:16.034 --> 01:17.243
Come, my son.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.637
Your transformation
is now complete.

01:37.347 --> 01:40.141
[cultists] We pledge to you
eternal devotion.

01:44.103 --> 01:45.438
I feel...

01:48.149 --> 01:49.192
different.

01:54.656 --> 01:55.865
What have I become?

01:57.784 --> 02:00.078
You are everything.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.580
Your power will have no equal.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.504
Your followers will do
anything you ask.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.467
Rise.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.810
Come. We must prepare
for the journey ahead.

02:25.812 --> 02:26.980
What's next?

02:28.147 --> 02:30.316
Next, we bring back
your father.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.794
[gasps]

02:50.670 --> 02:52.338
[panting]

02:54.507 --> 02:55.633
[grunts]

02:59.470 --> 03:02.265
They're gone. They're all gone.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.976
[Starfire] But we're
still here.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.814
Where were we?

03:09.814 --> 03:14.235
I don't know.
All I could see was darkness.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.237
It was a death realm.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.947
Her powers sent us there.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.200
How are we still here?

03:22.201 --> 03:23.703
Gar saved us somehow.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.373
I heard his voice
in the darkness.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.500
Yeah, I think I heard him too.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.960
I did too.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.254
[Tim] So where is he?

03:33.254 --> 03:36.758
I don't know.
He's alive though.
I'd feel it if he wasn't.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.640
[bell rings]

03:43.640 --> 03:45.725
You're going to kill me,
aren't you?

03:45.725 --> 03:47.477
I'm not gonna hurt you.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.603
Oh, thank you.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.398
I should've killed him
when I had the chance.

03:52.398 --> 03:56.819
Don't do it to yourself.
We all made the decision
to save him, together.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.238
[Superboy] Did we, though?

03:59.238 --> 04:00.698
I thought you wanted
to save him.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.368
I wanted to stop him.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.995
Maybe if you worked with us
instead of going off
on your own.

04:05.995 --> 04:08.414
We had to change the plan
to save your ass.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.458
And look
where your plan got us.

04:11.876 --> 04:15.171
In a big, empty
B-movie Batcave.

04:15.171 --> 04:17.882
And all the bad guys
scattered into the wind.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.803
Take a bow, boss man.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.012
[Raven] Stop it.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.807
Jinx died for us.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.936
Fighting with each other is
not going to change anything.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.898
What are you doing?

04:33.898 --> 04:37.110
Releasing her spirit
from this place of evil.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.440
How'd you do that?

05:16.941 --> 05:17.942
I don't know.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.197
My powers are back,
but they're different somehow.

05:24.574 --> 05:25.825
Let's get out of here.

05:27.535 --> 05:28.911
[Superboy] Hold on.

05:31.330 --> 05:32.707
There's something down here.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.684
[blows]

05:55.063 --> 05:57.106
[theme music playing]

06:27.011 --> 06:29.097
It's from Lex.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.140
He must have
planted it here to help us.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.685
Yeah, that sounds like Lex.

06:34.685 --> 06:37.772
Why would Lex leave something
here, of all places?

06:37.772 --> 06:41.818
"If you're reading this,
my plan failed and May is
as evil as I feared.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.236
You must stop her.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.572
The book contains
information only known by me.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.157
Give it to Richard.

06:48.157 --> 06:51.160
He claims to be
a master detective,
so let him detect."

06:52.203 --> 06:53.371
What else does it say?

06:54.372 --> 06:55.790
The rest is just for me.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.978
Hey. Lex knew?

07:18.646 --> 07:19.814
[Nightwing] Can you read that?

07:19.814 --> 07:23.651
No. It's an ancient
Tamaranean dialect, I think.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.989
Well, I definitely know
someone who can.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.532
Then what are we waiting for?

07:34.620 --> 07:37.415
Hey. Where's Conner?

07:43.713 --> 07:45.339
[Tim] Do you think Conner
will come back?

07:47.216 --> 07:48.384
[Krypto whimpering]

07:48.384 --> 07:50.887
I don't think he'd leave
Krypto behind forever.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.348
You okay?

07:55.474 --> 07:56.559
I don't know.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.353
I mean, you got
your powers back.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.688
That has to be good, right?

08:00.688 --> 08:03.316
When I first lost my powers,
I felt like

08:03.316 --> 08:04.859
there was something missing.

08:05.568 --> 08:06.944
And now they're back,

08:07.820 --> 08:09.447
but the weight is different.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.865
Like, the darkness is gone.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.743
[Krypto growls softly]

08:13.743 --> 08:15.494
Sounds like a good thing.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.998
Yeah.

08:18.998 --> 08:23.502
Sometimes I think
that part of me...
fed off the darkness.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.799
And I-I don't really know
who I am without it.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.469
[phone vibrating]

08:33.346 --> 08:34.805
Your parents?

08:36.182 --> 08:37.391
Bernard.

08:38.726 --> 08:39.977
Are you gonna respond?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.145
[Tim] And say what?

08:42.438 --> 08:45.149
He told me he didn't think
I was ready for combat.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.985
And he was right.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.238
What happened in that temple,
how do I explain that?

08:51.447 --> 08:53.157
I'm not gonna lie to him.

08:53.157 --> 08:57.620
I mean, we're not dead,
but we're not okay.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.374
We are now, though, right?
You have to tell them that
at least.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.917
We're still chasing down
May and Sebastian,

09:02.917 --> 09:05.628
and all we have to go on
is a book from
a dead Lex Luthor.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.507
How's he gonna handle that?

09:10.633 --> 09:13.803
I-I don't even know
how I'm handling it.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.430
You can't just ignore him
'cause you think
he can't deal with it.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.225
You're right.

09:20.434 --> 09:21.894
[sighs]

09:21.894 --> 09:23.813
Maybe I should
respond to my mom, too, then.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.649
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.694
[Dick] Listen, Roberta
is a little eccentric.

09:29.694 --> 09:33.656
But I trust her.
She's an expert in
extraterrestrial languages.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.658
Knows everything from
Klingon to Tamaranean.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.202
You know Klingon's not
a real language, right?

09:38.202 --> 09:39.495
Try telling her that.

09:39.495 --> 09:40.663
[knocking at door]

09:40.663 --> 09:42.206
Actually, don't.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.382
[Roberta] Come in.
EMF hats by the door.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.718
[Dick] We're actually good on
the, uh, hats, Roberta.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.094
[Roberta] Suit yourselves.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.265
Hello?

10:04.270 --> 10:06.772
No devices on us,
just like you asked.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.583
[sniffs]

10:27.126 --> 10:29.795
No scent of sulphur.
Must be a myth.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.972
I'm Kory.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.142
[speaking Tamaranean]

10:46.228 --> 10:49.899
[speaking Tamaranean]

10:51.150 --> 10:54.737
[laughs]

10:54.737 --> 10:57.698
I was expecting orange light.
Why is yours blue?

10:57.698 --> 10:59.784
Well, I guess
I'm full of surprises.

11:03.287 --> 11:08.709
Now that show and tell
is finished, we need your help,
reading this.

11:11.837 --> 11:12.797
Prophecy?

11:14.048 --> 11:15.633
You know about that?

11:15.633 --> 11:20.346
The end of the world?
Yeah. I know about it.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.057
We think the Blood Moon ritual
has happened.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.936
So there is a fulsome
son of Trigon

11:26.936 --> 11:30.898
manifested in the Well of Blood
here on our Earth?

11:37.571 --> 11:39.073
And he has the Horn?

11:41.700 --> 11:42.827
What horn?

11:47.706 --> 11:52.461
The one Trigon lost
in his early battles
with the first Tamaranean.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.422
It's protected
by his followers.

11:54.422 --> 11:57.842
Only one with Trigonic blood
can use it.

11:59.635 --> 12:00.886
Use it for what?

12:05.724 --> 12:09.895
"To usher forth
and welcome Trigon,

12:11.230 --> 12:14.316
here in our earthly realm

12:15.484 --> 12:16.819
for his final...

12:19.405 --> 12:22.992
dominion, over humanity."

12:25.327 --> 12:27.371
Basically, he's gonna
eat the world.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.587
And how do we stop him?

12:34.587 --> 12:35.880
[Roberta] You don't.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.507
She does.

12:40.593 --> 12:46.432
Your light, when used
to its full power,
can end this.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.643
But...

12:52.146 --> 12:53.189
But what?

12:56.942 --> 12:58.527
It will end you.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.824
You as you are now.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.832
[door opens]

13:11.832 --> 13:13.042
[Kory] What do you think?

13:13.042 --> 13:15.044
- Another day, another prophecy.
- Dick, she said--

13:15.044 --> 13:16.545
Yeah, I heard what she said.

13:16.545 --> 13:20.049
She's an expert
in foreign languages,
she's not a psychic.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.634
We're really not
gonna talk about it?

13:22.468 --> 13:23.886
About what?

13:23.886 --> 13:27.723
The little part about me dying
to save the universe.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.354
We're gonna go
find the Horn and stop this
before it goes any further.

13:41.570 --> 13:44.156
[Rachel] So, if anybody
with Trigonic blood
can get the Horn,

13:44.156 --> 13:45.908
then I'm just as qualified
as Sebastian.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.744
We just need to
get there first, right?

13:49.495 --> 13:51.247
Theoretically, yes.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.666
But we need to know
where the horn is
in order to do that.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.000
And we don't.

13:56.126 --> 13:58.003
Roberta was able to
translate this text.

13:58.003 --> 14:02.424
It appears relevant, obviously,
but at the same time,
it makes no sense.

14:02.424 --> 14:07.263
"Fire star explodes.
Blood portal opens.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.266
Horn of Power sounds."

14:10.266 --> 14:11.850
Nice three-step process.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.687
Do a cross-reference,
see if anything pops.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.774
What if it's not
about the words?

14:18.774 --> 14:20.150
What do you mean?

14:20.150 --> 14:21.652
It's called Gematria,

14:21.652 --> 14:24.780
and it's basically like,
semantic numerology.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.449
In most ancient languages,
each letter has
a numeric value.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.492
Like Scrabble.

14:28.492 --> 14:31.245
N-No. But...
Sure, basically.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.290
Gematria is all over
Biblical interpretation.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.708
That's how we
ended up with 666

14:35.708 --> 14:37.710
being the mark of the beast
from Revelations,

14:37.710 --> 14:40.129
even though technically,
it's about Emperor Nero,
but still--

14:40.129 --> 14:42.590
So this might be
an alphanumeric cypher.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.549
Maybe.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.092
But how do we know the values?

14:45.092 --> 14:46.552
Standard code breaking.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.847
Start with the word you know
in Tamaranean like, "fire."

14:49.847 --> 14:51.140
<i>A'ndr.</i>

14:51.140 --> 14:53.267
Across most ancient languages,
the numeric value of that

14:53.267 --> 14:56.437
is 100, so if that's true
for Tamaranean...

14:56.437 --> 14:59.648
Enter the known values
and let the computer
look for a pattern.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.985
[computer beeping]

15:06.238 --> 15:09.491
Okay, so we have
a bunch of numbers
instead of letters.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.410
The numbers
could mean anything.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.495
Unless it's both numbers
and letters.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.832
So, if "blood portal "
means "temple..."

15:18.083 --> 15:19.752
- then--
- Yes.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.587
[Dick] This line here...

15:22.880 --> 15:24.840
[Tim] Holy shit.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.134
Lex just gave us
the location of the Horn.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.012
You could've knocked.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.727
So, you found Lex's box
and decided to listen to
your father for once.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.729
I didn't know
you would be a part of this.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.773
Is that going to be a problem?

16:22.773 --> 16:24.942
People died because of you.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.073
What you did to me, to Gar,

16:32.700 --> 16:34.118
you never paid for that.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.329
[Mercy] Would you
like to kill me?

16:37.329 --> 16:39.832
Have at it, there's nothing
I can do to stop you.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.169
I must say,

16:45.671 --> 16:47.089
I love the new look.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.718
Your father
would've been pleased.

16:50.718 --> 16:54.638
Was that your job?
Pleasing my father?

16:55.889 --> 16:58.851
Working for Lex Luthor was
the greatest honor of my life.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.521
He was an extraordinary
human being.

17:04.022 --> 17:09.069
He valued intelligence,
hard work, and loyalty,
above all things.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.988
He gave me opportunities
in fields that women

17:10.988 --> 17:12.990
and women of color
don't often get.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.368
And he always
treated me with respect.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.626
So, why are you here?

17:24.626 --> 17:27.546
May Bennett sent her acolytes
to take over LexCorp.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.340
They were messy, but effective.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.805
Lex excelled at many things.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.892
One of the most remarkable
was his ability
to see people's potential

17:40.851 --> 17:42.770
and harness it
for his own gain.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.147
May was one of
his rare missteps.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.776
You were not.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.445
And now, May and her son
are your problem to solve.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.823
Maybe the Titans
will stop them.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.201
If you believed that,
you wouldn't be here.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.705
Lex saw your potential,

18:01.705 --> 18:05.167
and he saw how you were
wasting it with the Titans.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.710
What would he have me do?

18:07.586 --> 18:09.838
Avenge him, for starters.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.383
Take back LexCorp.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.385
That is your legacy.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.763
Your responsibility.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.848
And then?

18:19.848 --> 18:23.519
After that, be everything
he created you to be.

18:26.772 --> 18:27.981
What's that?

18:29.691 --> 18:31.985

your friends don't have.

18:31.985 --> 18:35.572
Lex was preparing
countermeasures against
what May had planned.

18:35.572 --> 18:38.700
I took this
when I left the building.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.418
You have a choice, Conner.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.464
Take this and run back
to the Titans.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.091
Or keep it for yourself

18:54.967 --> 18:57.511
and step into your true power.

18:57.511 --> 19:01.557
You are smarter, stronger,
and more powerful
than all of them.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.016
You know you are.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.978
You don't need them, Conner.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.065
You can stop May and Sebastian
all on your own.

only one with Trigonic blood
can use the horn.

What are you doing here?

20:07.497 --> 20:08.916
I've been trying to
get a hold of you

20:08.916 --> 20:10.792
since you went off
to storm that temple.

20:10.792 --> 20:14.212
And, um, I hadn't been
having any luck, so I activated

20:14.212 --> 20:15.797

20:15.797 --> 20:17.049
You tracked us?

20:17.716 --> 20:19.551

20:19.551 --> 20:21.678
And that's great.

we could use your help.

I'll contact the lab,

satellite images of the area.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.613

32:14.349 --> 32:16.184
And he's not the Son of Trigon.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.271
You better start
tellin' us the truth.

32:23.650 --> 32:27.862
Okay. I know you're scared,
and you should be,

32:29.030 --> 32:30.782
but not of me.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.659
My friends and I,
we're the good guys.

32:36.996 --> 32:38.456
We'll see.

32:38.456 --> 32:41.542
Okay, so you know
about the prophecy.

32:41.542 --> 32:44.462
You know about
the Son of Trigon.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.631
My friend's obviously
not his son.

32:46.631 --> 32:49.050
I mean, the drug didn't
work on him, did it?

32:54.138 --> 32:55.515
How'd you get into town then?

32:58.476 --> 33:01.062
I'm the daughter of Trigon.

33:02.730 --> 33:05.566
Prophecy doesn't say
anything about a daughter.

33:05.566 --> 33:07.318
[Rachel] But here we are.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.821
And the man your looking for,
the son of Trigon,

33:09.821 --> 33:12.865
he is on his way,
and he wants the Horn.

33:12.865 --> 33:16.202
Look, I promise
I'm here to help,

33:16.202 --> 33:17.870
but I need to know
what I'm up against.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.580
And I need to find my friends.

33:22.792 --> 33:23.918
[sighs]

33:23.918 --> 33:25.253
Go on.

33:28.256 --> 33:31.134
Caul's Folly is... magic.

33:31.134 --> 33:33.428
- [scoffs softly] Magic?
- Or cursed,

33:33.428 --> 33:35.221
depending on
your viewpoint, I guess.

33:35.221 --> 33:37.765
[Jacob] We've been
trapped here for years.

33:37.765 --> 33:39.892
The Sheriff is the keeper.

33:39.892 --> 33:41.769
He'll protect the Horn
to the death.

33:41.769 --> 33:44.981
He and the others,
they've been waiting
for the "chosen one."

33:46.774 --> 33:49.527
They think your friend is it.

33:49.527 --> 33:52.488
And what will they do when
they find out that he's not?

33:53.364 --> 33:54.532
They'll kill him.

33:57.160 --> 34:02.623
Okay. If you free me,
help me find my friend
and the Horn,

34:02.623 --> 34:05.251
I promise I can
get you out of this town.

34:09.714 --> 34:10.715
Please?

34:15.052 --> 34:17.722
If she's lyin', we're dead.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.267
I don't care.

34:23.770 --> 34:26.773
I'd rather be dead than
spend another day here.

34:37.074 --> 34:40.578
Horn or no Horn,
you're gettin' us outta here.

34:48.252 --> 34:49.962
[device whirring]

34:49.962 --> 34:52.173
Yeah. No. Yes, yes,
I understand

34:52.173 --> 34:54.717
that the images
you just sent me
are only two hours old,

34:54.717 --> 34:55.843
but they're not going to work.

34:55.843 --> 34:57.804
I need a satellite
in the area right now.

34:57.804 --> 34:59.764
All right? Thank you.

35:01.140 --> 35:02.809
Giant RVs don't just vanish.

35:02.809 --> 35:05.394
[Tim] It's like they
dropped off the grid.

35:05.394 --> 35:07.188
They can't
have just disappeared!

35:07.188 --> 35:09.816
They didn't, all right?
We just... We just
need to figure out

35:09.816 --> 35:11.317
what actually happened.

35:12.276 --> 35:15.029
Um, Tim? Tim?

35:15.029 --> 35:16.197
Yeah?

35:16.197 --> 35:17.949
- Could I have that back?
- Sure. Just need to--

35:17.949 --> 35:20.201
- [buzzes]
- [Bernard] No, don't!

35:20.201 --> 35:22.870
Both pieces, please.
Thank you.

35:24.455 --> 35:26.207
[Bernard groans]

35:26.207 --> 35:31.629
Sorry, I just thought
there has to be some sort
of energy... here, right?

35:31.629 --> 35:35.842
- Like, an energy
signature. Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

35:35.842 --> 35:38.511
What you want is this.

35:38.511 --> 35:41.389
It's really easy.
You just point
and press the button.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.975
If it lights up,
you found something.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.060
Try to bring it back
in one piece this time.

35:46.602 --> 35:47.812
Gotcha.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.984
[sighs] Oh, God.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.485
[device beeping slowly]

36:03.286 --> 36:06.455
[Tim] I don't know.
It doesn't feel right
to just stop looking.

36:06.455 --> 36:09.083
Tim, there's nothing more
we can do tonight, all right?

36:09.083 --> 36:11.502
Look, tomorrow, we'll have
the geological studies,

36:11.502 --> 36:13.087
and we can start again.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.219
[sighs]

36:20.219 --> 36:23.055
- [man] Good evening.
Checking in?
- Yes, please.

36:23.055 --> 36:24.891
Uh, travelling for business
or pleasure today?

36:26.183 --> 36:27.226
Does it matter?

36:27.226 --> 36:30.313
They make me ask you that.
Uh, one room? Two?

36:30.313 --> 36:31.731
Two, please.

36:31.731 --> 36:34.025
I, uh, I may have an adjoining.

36:36.736 --> 36:38.195
That would be lovely,
thank you.
