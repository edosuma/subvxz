00:02.000 --> 00:04.480
SIRENS WAIL, TENSE MUSIC BUILDS

00:05.720 --> 00:08.760
This programme contains
some strong language

00:10.320 --> 00:11.400
Good afternoon, Madam.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.520
Yeah, stay street-smart.
Stay street-smart.

00:13.520 --> 00:15.920
Stop!

00:15.920 --> 00:17.480
Stop!

00:17.480 --> 00:19.040
Stay street-smart.

00:24.160 --> 00:27.120
Stay street-smart.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.760
Shit.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.000
Oi!

00:30.000 --> 00:31.920
It's kicking off.
Pretend we can't see.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.000
Arrest him! Police!

00:34.000 --> 00:35.760
Arrest him! Damn it. A thief!

00:35.760 --> 00:37.480
Ah, awkward.

00:37.480 --> 00:38.920
We actually can't. Huh?

00:38.920 --> 00:40.760
Ooh! Ooh!

00:40.760 --> 00:42.040
Oh, that's really awkward.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.480
I'm so sorry. We're PCSOs.
We don't have the power of arrest.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.760
Rest assured, though,
we will inform a police officer.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.160
He's halfway down the street now.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.520
I could inform a police officer!

00:49.520 --> 00:51.840
I mean, if you wouldn't mind,
that'd be helpful because,

00:51.840 --> 00:54.000
you know, busy. Oh, hey.
Stay street-smart.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.320
Thank you.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.640
What do you guys actually do?

00:56.640 --> 00:58.640
Oh, we are rebuilding
the relationship

00:58.640 --> 01:00.600
between the community
and the police.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.560
Hence Police Community
Support Officer.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.600
Oh, was that the plan, yeah,
when you left school?

01:04.600 --> 01:06.080
You dickheads!

01:07.920 --> 01:09.520
Whatever. Didn't hurt. Don't care.

01:09.520 --> 01:10.840
Oh, sir? Sorry, erm...

01:10.840 --> 01:12.880
Kay... On a scale of one to ten...
Kay?

01:12.880 --> 01:15.400
..how would you rate your
experience... Read the room, mate.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.680
Dom, we need to do the survey.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.640
How would you rate your experience
with the Met Police today?

01:19.640 --> 01:21.400
He's gone.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.680
Oh.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.840
I'll just put that down as a seven.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.280
Right, so these are
my two operatives, are they?

01:34.280 --> 01:36.880
These are the two officers
that can infiltrate the gang?

01:36.880 --> 01:39.560
Jen and Simon are two of the finest,
the most highly trained

01:39.560 --> 01:41.440
undercover officers we have, sir.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.840
Sure. And, you know, no offence,

01:43.840 --> 01:46.480
guys, but take a look at the gang.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.360
What's your point, Clinton?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.400
The gang's black, Dave.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.040
Really?

01:58.680 --> 02:00.400
Oh, yes. So they are.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.080
Yes. Terribly sorry about that, sir.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.480
I don't actually see colour.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.800
I do a fairly decent patois,
if you're interested.

02:08.800 --> 02:09.840
Ooh... No, thank you.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.240
I sometimes do it at parties.
I phoned up LBC once, didn't I?

02:12.240 --> 02:14.200
He did! Pretended to be Levi Roots.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.640
Please stop talking.

02:19.120 --> 02:22.560
Inspector, you asked for
two undercover police officers.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.880
We provided two undercover
police officers.

02:24.880 --> 02:27.000
The only place they can go
undercover is B&Q

02:27.000 --> 02:28.200
on a bank holiday Monday.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.200
Well, that's all you're getting.

02:30.200 --> 02:33.680
It's almost as if the Met want
this investigation to fail.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.560
How difficult can it be to find
two young black officers

02:36.560 --> 02:38.440
who are up to the task?

02:41.920 --> 02:45.520
Ah! Another great day supporting our
officers and being a visible

02:45.520 --> 02:47.400
presence in the community.
Shut up, Kay.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.120
You know how I like to kick back and
shake off the cares of a busy day?

02:50.120 --> 02:51.400
I'm not coming to your church.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.000
Yes? Can I help you?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.280
Ah, no.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.840
This is a restricted area.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.240
Can I ask what you're doing here?

02:59.240 --> 03:01.200
I've worked here for four years.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.400
That's me.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.520
Right.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.400
Yes. Good.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.040
Well, carry on.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.400
You should be wearing your lanyards.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.520
But, erm, I'll let it go this time.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.920
Go on.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.640
Can you believe that bitch?

03:22.640 --> 03:25.520
To be fair, we should be wearing our
lanyards. It's not about lanyards.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.800
What were his exact words?

03:32.800 --> 03:35.880
He said, "It's almost as if the Met
wants this investigation to fail."

03:35.880 --> 03:37.960
Wants the investigation to fail?

03:37.960 --> 03:40.160
Presumably it amounts to
insubordination.

03:40.160 --> 03:43.520
Well, if it's not insubordination,
it's skirting dangerously close.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.640
Absolutely, ma'am.

03:44.640 --> 03:45.800
All right.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.040
Love to Peter.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.000
SIGHS

04:01.480 --> 04:03.320
Dominique? Yep?

04:03.320 --> 04:05.720
Detective Inspector Clinton Blair.

04:05.720 --> 04:08.000
You might have see me
around the station.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.760
Mm... Maybe.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.920
I want to talk to you about a job.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.480
But not here, though.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.600
Meet me tomorrow.

04:14.600 --> 04:15.760
Tomorrow's Saturday!

04:15.760 --> 04:17.600
I know. Meet me tomorrow,
one o'clock,

04:17.600 --> 04:19.280
Giuseppe's on Mare Street.

04:19.280 --> 04:21.800
Ah... Right.

04:21.800 --> 04:25.680
Right, yeah, this is a weak-arse
attempt to try and get me on a date.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.320
I'm not interested.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.920
I mean, you are hot in
a kind of budget Idris way,

04:29.920 --> 04:32.000
but I don't do beards. Sorry.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.360
It's not a date.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.400
I'm not physically attracted to you.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.320
So just another brother
who don't date black women?

04:38.320 --> 04:39.600
Shame.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.680
Shame on you.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.440
I only ever date black women.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.000
Yeah, well...that ain't going
to happen this time.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.400
You can buy me lunch,
but, yeah, that's about it.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.640
I'm not buying you lunch
and nothing's going to happen.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.760
Meet me tomorrow. Tell no-one.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.640
You want this.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.800
Oh, fuck!

05:16.800 --> 05:18.320
Why are you here?

05:18.320 --> 05:19.560
Come.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.680
This is cool, isn't it?

05:22.680 --> 05:25.600
Look, if this is about handing out
leaflets or anything to do with

05:25.600 --> 05:27.200
dog shit bins, I'm not interested.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.880
This isn't about dog shit bins.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.640
I want to talk to you about
an undercover mission.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.560
I need two officers to infiltrate
a gang dealing drugs

05:34.560 --> 05:37.000
on Brightmarsh Estate.
We'll do it. Hang on.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.800
You need two drug dealers,
so "get the black people"?

05:39.800 --> 05:42.000
The Brightmarsh gang is black.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.520
The Met keeps sending me
middle-aged white guys.

05:44.520 --> 05:48.360
I need two young black officers
to go places where... Yeah,

05:48.360 --> 05:50.600
I hate to break it to you, Clinton,
but we ain't street.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.880
Yeah, I'm gathering that.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.920
Look, my dad's a paediatrician,
and this one runs a prayer group.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.360
Wednesday nights. All welcome.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.280
Look, I'll guide you through
the whole thing.

05:58.280 --> 06:01.000
We'll do it. Hey, will you stop
just saying, "We'll do it"?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.240
This sounds dangerous.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.400
It is.

06:04.920 --> 06:05.960
All right.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.160
So what's in it for us?

06:07.160 --> 06:08.960
Yeah. Let's talk terms, Clinton.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.320
You both get service medals.
We'll do it. Kay!

06:11.320 --> 06:12.600
You get to do real police work.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.240
DOM SCOFFS
Not interested.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.280
What?

06:15.280 --> 06:18.040
Look, Clinton, I'm in this game
for the free Tube travel,

06:18.040 --> 06:21.320
parking in disabled bays
and 10% off at Cineworld.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.760
I've got 30 years to retirement.
That can go by like that.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.200
I thought that was going to have
a bigger impact.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.440
Look, use your middle finger.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.640
Why would I use my middle finger?
That's dumb! Shut up.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.640
All right. Each their own.
LOUD CLICK

06:33.640 --> 06:34.760
How did you...

06:34.760 --> 06:36.920
Look, my point is,
when I say I'm not interested,

06:36.920 --> 06:38.360
I'm not interested.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.480
Yes, you are.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.640
You don't know me.

06:40.640 --> 06:41.680
Yes, I do.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.600
You've got a first class degree
in Criminology

06:43.600 --> 06:45.040
from the University of Middlesex.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.880
In your first year on the job, you
applied for a promotion three times.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.200
You were rejected three times.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.320
That's when the infractions
started creeping in.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.720
Tardiness, unexplained absences,
incorrect uniform.

06:54.720 --> 06:55.960
You got lazy.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.200
You gave up.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.040
But you're clever. You're good.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.280
You're police.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.600
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, Dom,

07:03.600 --> 07:05.400
and, yes, you do want it.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.560
What's the pay?

07:11.960 --> 07:13.400
Better than a PCSO.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.200
Also I do want the medal. Yes!

07:17.200 --> 07:18.680
All right.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.240
Now, listen.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.680
Here's the thing.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.840
This mission...

07:25.840 --> 07:27.720
..it doesn't exist. What?

07:27.720 --> 07:31.640
No, I mean, we're doing it,
but it's off the books.

07:31.640 --> 07:34.920
The only people who know about it,
the only people who will ever

07:34.920 --> 07:38.120
know about it,
are sat around this table.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.320
AROUND the table.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.360
That was so cool.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.440
So will we, like, take on new
identities when we go undercover?

07:50.440 --> 07:51.680
No, too risky.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.640
Better to make the truth
your cover story.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.800
What, that we're police?

07:54.800 --> 07:55.840
That you were police.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.920
You're going to need to get
yourself fired. Fired?

07:57.920 --> 07:59.080
What, like, fired for real?

07:59.080 --> 08:01.200
As soon as this is all over,
I'll bring you both back -

08:01.200 --> 08:03.600
as part of my team, not PCSOs.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.640
So, yes, fired for real.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.520
But...how are we meant to do that?

08:07.520 --> 08:09.040
Use your imagination.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.040
SIREN WAILS

08:17.040 --> 08:19.360
TYRES SCREECH

08:19.360 --> 08:22.000
Woo!

08:22.000 --> 08:24.400
Aargh! Stop, stop!

08:24.400 --> 08:26.040
You're going too fast!

08:26.040 --> 08:28.960
This is fucking brilliant!

08:28.960 --> 08:32.120
KAY SCREAMS

08:35.680 --> 08:37.680
Have either of you heard
a word I've said about

08:37.680 --> 08:40.000
the way you have brought
the service into disrepute?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.440
Never, ever, in my twenty...
Thirty...

08:42.440 --> 08:45.800
..37 years in this service
have I ever...

08:48.400 --> 08:51.120
You are fucking kidding me.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.680
Not at all, madam.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.080
Not at all.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.440
Cheers, all.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.720
Sir?

08:58.720 --> 09:00.360
Want one?

09:01.520 --> 09:02.560
OK, stage two.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.600
You're going to steal drugs
from police custody.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.000
What?! Rob the police? Correct.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Then you're going to sell it
on the estate to get

09:09.000 --> 09:11.280
the gang's attention.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.920
Fired black officers nick drugs
and then turn to dealing?

09:13.920 --> 09:16.520
Can we please just talk about
the negative stereotypes here?

09:16.520 --> 09:17.960
Dom, you're infiltrating a gang.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.280
Yes, we're dealing
in negative stereotypes.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.400
OK, OK, what about this?

09:21.400 --> 09:22.880
We formed a street theatre troupe

09:22.880 --> 09:24.280
doing impromptu performances

09:24.280 --> 09:26.040
on the Brightmarsh Estate.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.800
This is how it's going to work.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.160
When seized drugs have served their
purpose as evidence,

09:32.160 --> 09:33.480
they're incinerated.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.840
The police have an arrangement
with the local hospital.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.760
Officers phone ahead, schedule
a time to sign over the drugs

09:38.760 --> 09:41.160
for incineration by hospital staff.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.400
That's the weak point.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.400
This all sounds very, very risky.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.760
Listen, I'm protected,

09:47.760 --> 09:49.960
so you're protected.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.000
Trust me.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.080
I can intercept the call
from the station,

09:53.080 --> 09:54.680
find out where they're going.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.280
I'll create a delay.

09:57.520 --> 10:00.680
Then I'll go to the hospital
at the specified time,

10:00.680 --> 10:05.000
and sign over a fake package
for incineration.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.800
Then you'll meet the officers
and intercept the drugs.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.040
Yes, good day, sir.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.280
Walk normally.
I am walking normally!

10:17.280 --> 10:18.920
That's not normal!

10:18.920 --> 10:20.600
Ah. Incineration staff?

10:20.600 --> 10:22.320
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.720
Good. Cos I have a whole load
of soiled bedding here for you.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.160
Oh, oh... It's a real mix and match.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.480
Thank you. Thank you very much.

10:29.480 --> 10:32.600
Oh...
THEY GAG

10:32.600 --> 10:34.600
Why do you never use
the hand-sanitiser?

10:34.600 --> 10:36.640
Because we're fleeing a crime scene!

10:38.960 --> 10:40.960
But I touched poo!

10:40.960 --> 10:42.200
Ahh!

10:42.200 --> 10:43.440
Don't ask.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.200
This all seems like a lot of trouble
to go to for a few drug arrests

10:48.200 --> 10:50.080
on an estate.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.080
I'm right, aren't I?

10:52.080 --> 10:55.040
You'll be told what you need to
know when you need to know it.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.040
ENGINE STARTS

11:15.120 --> 11:16.520
OK, guys, you...

11:18.200 --> 11:19.440
Put this on.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.000
Oh, nice, nice. Wear it backwards?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.720
Don't. Too cool?

11:22.720 --> 11:24.040
Yeah.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.320
You got the product?

11:25.320 --> 11:26.360
Yeah.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.640
Here's your takings.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.480
Remember everything we went through.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.040
I'll park up where I can see you.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.960
If things get hairy, I'll step in.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.440
You've got this.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.800
I'll do the selling and the talking.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.800
OK? Fine. Thank you.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.920
Because I have blatantly got
the best seller's credentials.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.160
I worked at Footlocker.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.600
Well, I did door-to-door sales.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.040
You were handing out Bibles.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.000
Working for the biggest boss
there is.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.880
Just... Thank you very much. ..walk.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.840
Stand here.
I know what I'm talking about.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.440
Just stand. Be normal.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.680
And stop talking.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.680
Not like th... Sh, sh, sh!

12:09.680 --> 12:11.200
Did you see that?

12:11.200 --> 12:13.000
I just cruised onto the kerb.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.120
Well done. Good for you. OK.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.600
It's TJ, by the way.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.240
You might've heard of me.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.600
Ah, can't say that I have, no.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.440
Well, I'm pretty well-known
on this estate.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.840
So if anyone gives you any S-H-A-T,

12:24.840 --> 12:27.000
you can tell them you know me.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
OK, will do. Thanks.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.280
What you doin'?

12:30.280 --> 12:33.320
Oh, we're just... We're just
hanging out, you know? Yeah.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.440
Just, you know, just chillin'.
You know, just... Just chillin' out.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.600
You're selling drugs, aren't you?

12:38.600 --> 12:40.640
Well, we're not doing it with you
standing here,

12:40.640 --> 12:42.640
so if you could just...get to going

12:42.640 --> 12:46.480
because if the police come
you're going to get arrested.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.720
The police don't arrest dealers
on Brightmarsh.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.560
OK. Bye, child.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.520
Bye, TJ.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.000
Oh, we've got one.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.480
Get... Hey, hi.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.080
What you in the market for?

12:58.080 --> 13:00.000
Some weed, some Charlie, some...

13:00.000 --> 13:01.200
No, we've only got heroin.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.560
Oh, we've only got heroin,
but you look like you'll be fine

13:03.560 --> 13:05.160
with that, so...yeah. Money first.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.280
Yeah. Good. Money first.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.880
Thank you. That's...

13:09.880 --> 13:12.360
Yeah. Hmm... There you go.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.560
Right. Hmm?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.640
What? Oh, yeah, drugs.
DOM LAUGHS AWKWARDLY

13:15.640 --> 13:17.920
Cos you needed the drugs.
That's what you paid... OK.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.720
So here's your five, your six
and your ten. Thank you very much.

13:20.720 --> 13:21.920
Take care.

13:23.640 --> 13:24.680
"Take care"?

13:24.680 --> 13:26.920
Well, it's good customer service.
He'll come back.

13:26.920 --> 13:30.040
He'll come back because
he's addicted to heroin. Sure.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.840
But you know Nero
does them little cards...

13:31.840 --> 13:34.080
Go stand over there. Oh, OK.
Cos that's how they do it.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.040
No, because I want you to stand
over there. Sure.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.520
No, that's smart.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.200
Stop walking like you've got
a bowel impact!

13:41.200 --> 13:43.080
I...

13:43.080 --> 13:44.480
I'll... I'm going to pray for you.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.560
Just go.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.800
Yo.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.800
You have Big H, yeah?
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.800
Here you go. Take that,
and then I'll take that.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.040
Thank you very much.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.120
Take care. Bye-bye.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.680
There you go.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.200
Ah, Dom? Yeah?

14:02.200 --> 14:04.880
Those guys look very interested
in what we're doing right now.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.000
Shit, shit, shit. This is it,
this is it, this is it.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Game face. Smile. Smi...
No, no, no. Frown.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.440
Look gangster.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.880
Here we go.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.480
Like... Like you're a gangster.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.600
Like, act tough.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.080
Hey, yo, yo, yo, boss man,
you best move your car, you know.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.360
It's residents only.

14:18.360 --> 14:19.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, in a minute.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.840
No, come on, boss man.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.440
KAY SIGHS AWKWARDLY

14:24.160 --> 14:26.000
KAY SIGHS AWKWARDLY AND BABBLES

14:28.200 --> 14:29.800
Yeah, oh...

14:29.800 --> 14:31.880
How you doing, lads?

14:31.880 --> 14:34.800
We're just doing
a spot of drug dealing.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.800
Oh, my goodness.
We're not on your patch, are we?

14:36.800 --> 14:39.200
I told you they were called patches.
Shut up, you dickhead.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.440
Yeah, I am. Yeah.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.080
Take off your bag.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.720
What? Give me the fucking bag, man.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.640
What? OK. OK.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.280
I just... I just got my nails done.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.560
So just give me the ticket.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.960
Listen, brother,
I'm just trying to help you out.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.040
You move your car,
I don't have to give you a ticket.

14:54.040 --> 14:57.680
Just give me the ticket, will you?
Oh, is it?

14:57.680 --> 15:00.520
Break them.
KAY LAUGHS AWKWARDLY

15:00.520 --> 15:02.800
Apologies for the cock-up.
Pardon my French.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.520
Haw-haw-haw!
GUN COCKS

15:04.520 --> 15:05.960
Come round the corner.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.080
Do we have to?
Come round the fucking corner, man.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.320
Yeah. Which corner, though?

15:09.320 --> 15:10.880
Shut up.
Because there's quite a few.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.840
I'm just saying
that there's quite a few corners.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.560
Look, I'm police.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.200
Now go.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.400
Shit, man.
The ticket's in the system now.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.320
I don't give a shit
about the ticket.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.000
Let me see what I can do for you.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.160
I never do this.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.400
Fuck off.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.400
Put your hand out.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.840
Oh, please. Put your hand out!

15:46.840 --> 15:49.200
No, please don't shoot my hand.
I play keys in the church band.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.520
Man, shut up.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.560
Who do you work for? No-one.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.240
Do not fuck with me.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.360
Where did you get your food from?

15:56.360 --> 15:59.000
We...we stole it
from...from the police.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.760
How did you two badman
steal from the police?

16:03.760 --> 16:05.240
OK... Ahem.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.600
..here's the thing -

16:06.600 --> 16:08.840
we used to be in the police.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.200
Yo, they're feds. Drop them!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:11.200 --> 16:13.760
We used to be in the police!
We USED to be in the police!

16:13.760 --> 16:15.920
Like PCSOs. What, the shit police?

16:15.920 --> 16:19.840
OK, that's a bit rude,
but, yeah, and then we got fired.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.160
Why?

16:21.160 --> 16:24.040
Let's just say
the force did not agree

16:24.040 --> 16:25.960
with our extracurricular activities.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.600
I showed my bum bum
to some pensioners.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.880
So we decided
to take that lot from evidence

16:30.880 --> 16:34.240
on our way out and pay ourselves
a little redundancy.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.320
We don't have a supplier,
we don't work for anyone.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.880
We just wanted to sell that lot
and split the money. Ahem.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.920
How long you been out here for?
Just this afternoon,

16:44.920 --> 16:46.120
a few hours. Plus wee breaks.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.440
We've been going to Burger King
cos she needs to sit down.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.560
Who's asking you to talk about my
pee breaks? You need to sit down
to go toilet.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.040
It's a lot easier for me
to go toilet.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.240
I go number one standing up.
It's my personal business!

16:55.240 --> 16:56.480
Stop talking... Shut up!

16:58.720 --> 17:01.560
Look, here's what's going to happen.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.040
You're going
to sell the rest of that,

17:05.040 --> 17:07.960
and you're going
to bring the money here. Yeah? OK.

17:09.120 --> 17:11.440
Soapy's Laundrette? That's clever.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.160
Ask for a service wash.
Service wash.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.520
Soapy's. That makes a lot of sense.
It does.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.320
It's like, um, like, we're asking
for a Soapy's... It's all up...

17:19.320 --> 17:21.200
..all up there in the noggin.
Can you fuck off?

17:21.200 --> 17:22.520
Yeah. Sure. No, no. Yeah.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.080
Sure, no. Yeah.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.120
Oh, Clinton! Mate!

17:34.120 --> 17:36.000
Sir, sir, that was brilliant!

17:36.000 --> 17:38.120
It totally worked.
They were like, "What you up to?"

17:38.120 --> 17:40.680
And we were like, "What?" And
they were like, "Show me your hand."

17:40.680 --> 17:43.120
And I was like, "No, no,
that's not..." That was dangerous!

17:43.120 --> 17:46.240
We've been out there all day
touching junkies.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.160
They pulled a gun on us. Yeah?

17:48.160 --> 17:50.160
You said you would step in
if things got hairy.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.200
I would have.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.640
They pulled a gun on us!

17:52.640 --> 17:54.840
I would have stepped in
if I thought I'd seen something

17:54.840 --> 17:57.400
that you couldn't handle.
So, what did they say?

17:57.400 --> 17:59.680
Sell the rest of the gear
and bring them the cash tomorrow.

17:59.680 --> 18:02.120
Perfect. So, go back out there
tomorrow and sell what you can.

18:02.120 --> 18:05.200
I'll take what you can't shift
to make up the shortfall.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.800
Nice work, officers.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.160
Ahem.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.080
We would like a service wash,
please.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.960
MUSIC PLAYS

18:31.560 --> 18:32.840
Just...

18:32.840 --> 18:34.680
Just go. Go.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.920
Ahem.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.120
You're early.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.160
I wasn't expecting you
till tomorrow.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.320
Yeah, well, you know,
we sold it all.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.640
Sorry.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.080
Run along.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.520
Nah, nah, nah, wait.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.760
Give them another pack.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.320
Do it.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.000
You lot need a job,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.120
this is a growing operation.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.520
That's yours now, yeah?

19:06.720 --> 19:08.760
You owe us a grand in a week.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.600
OK. Cool.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.760
Dismissed. Yeah. Thank you.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.480
OK, well,
have a good drug-dealing day.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.480
Do you trust them, fam?

19:19.480 --> 19:23.080
I asked around,
and their story checks out.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.400
Kamal was in the Air Cadets.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.440
Everyone's on a journey, innit?

19:44.840 --> 19:46.040
Wash your hands.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.480
Oh, my God. I need a towel.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.600
Mm-hm.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.400
For all that is secret will
eventually be brought into the open,

20:10.400 --> 20:13.120
and everything that is concealed
will be brought to light

20:13.120 --> 20:14.720
and made known to all.

20:18.720 --> 20:19.960
Just, um...

20:21.200 --> 20:23.800
Just going to my room to sleep!

20:23.800 --> 20:24.920
Hi, by the way!

20:41.200 --> 20:42.520
Nice.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.760
Very nice.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.640
You lot are doing good.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.280
We're upping your part.

21:12.760 --> 21:13.800
Hello?

21:13.800 --> 21:15.680
Come to your door.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.040
Who is this?

21:26.240 --> 21:27.720
Tevin.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.720
Hi. Ho...

21:29.720 --> 21:31.520
How do you know where I live?

21:31.520 --> 21:34.240
Is that a problem?
No, no, no problem.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.840
I need you to come with me.

21:35.840 --> 21:38.360
Er...why? You'll see.

21:38.360 --> 21:39.720
Ah, yeah.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.120
You know, thing is, I would...

21:41.120 --> 21:44.440
CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY
..I would, but I just had a wine,

21:44.440 --> 21:46.680
a large one, and a Nytol.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.960
I don't make a habit of it,

21:47.960 --> 21:50.200
but, you know, sometimes being
a black woman in London,

21:50.200 --> 21:52.400
you need something
to take the edge off. Get your coat.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.920
OK. I'm just going to...

21:53.920 --> 21:55.200
..go and get...

22:08.600 --> 22:10.160
Hi.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.400
Um, Tevin...

22:21.400 --> 22:23.560
DOM CLEARS HER THROAT
..where we going?

22:23.560 --> 22:24.960
Walthamstow Marshes.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.880
Right, yeah.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.200
That's great.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.200
Tev, mate, can you stick Magic on?

22:31.200 --> 22:32.600
Shut up.

22:52.320 --> 22:53.760
Get out.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.800
Just it's a little high up.
I've only got little legs.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.560
Oop, yep. Made it.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.000
KAY LAUGHS

23:06.000 --> 23:08.560
Three cheers for Britain's wetlands!
Ha-ha! Hip hip hoor...

23:08.560 --> 23:10.280
KNIFE CLANGS ON FLOOR

23:11.480 --> 23:13.600
What is that? What?

23:13.600 --> 23:15.200
I've just seen it
fall from your sleeve.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.640
No, it didn't. I saw it.

23:16.640 --> 23:20.040
No, I think it's always been there,
just in that spot.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.080
Oh, that?

23:21.080 --> 23:23.200
DOM FAKE CHUCKLES
I thought you meant something...

23:23.200 --> 23:25.520
No, that. That...that is my shank.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.240
Were you going to stab me? No.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.600
No. To be honest with you, Tev,
this...this guy here,

23:32.600 --> 23:34.680
he's been known
to get a little handsy.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.920
KAY LAUGHS
It's true. Yeah.

23:36.920 --> 23:40.880
So I have taken to carrying that.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.000
I'm on a journey, Tevin.
I'm on a journey.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.040
He is.

23:46.440 --> 23:47.480
Thank you.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.720
DOM WHISPERS INAUDIBLY

23:53.160 --> 23:55.040
Start digging.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.880
Oh... What? Oh.

23:56.880 --> 23:59.080
KAY WHIMPERS

23:59.080 --> 24:00.480
Please!

24:01.640 --> 24:03.360
Please, I don't want to die.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.960
I don't want to die!
You think I'm going to kill you?

24:08.040 --> 24:10.400
You think I'm some sort of psycho
or something?

24:11.400 --> 24:13.120
Nah.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.160
Nah.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.200
You...

24:21.280 --> 24:23.240
I need you to bury this body.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.960
Oh!

24:24.960 --> 24:26.600
Yeah.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.000
OK.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.240
Um...

24:29.240 --> 24:31.120
Where are you going?

24:31.120 --> 24:33.280
It's ten to midnight.
Going home to bed.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.720
How do we get home?

24:34.720 --> 24:36.560
Get a fucking Uber.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.000
OK. Yeah.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.560
Thank you, Tevin.

24:39.560 --> 24:41.720
It's always a pleasure.
Drive safely.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.240
Bye.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.080
Look out for the roads and stuff.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.120
Oh!

24:49.120 --> 24:51.080
Oh! Shit!

24:51.080 --> 24:52.800
That's a dead body, Dom! Oh, my God!

24:52.800 --> 24:54.480
That's a dead body, Dom!

24:54.480 --> 24:56.280
Oh, my God! That's a dead body!

24:56.280 --> 24:57.920
Oh, my God! Oh!

24:57.920 --> 24:59.680
OK. Wait. What are you doing?

24:59.680 --> 25:02.040
I'm calling Clinton.
No, no, no, but it's after 10.30.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.560
That's the cut-off, isn't it?

25:04.560 --> 25:08.760
There is no cut-off when someone's
just asked you to bury a body!

25:08.760 --> 25:10.960
I don't know.
