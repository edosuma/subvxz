00:02.088 --> 00:04.723
- Are you sure it's here?
- It was.

00:04.791 --> 00:07.693
- Do you think it swam away?
- We'll have to look.

00:07.761 --> 00:11.530
- Whoa.
- Come on! It's time to go.

00:11.598 --> 00:14.350
Aww. Already?

00:14.351 --> 00:17.102
Wait, wait. Can I warp us back?

00:17.170 --> 00:23.342
- All right.
- Yes! Hmmmmm...

00:23.410 --> 00:27.212
...mmmm!
I did it! I'm the warp master!

00:27.280 --> 00:30.171
- You did great.
- Good job.

00:30.172 --> 00:31.617
St-e-e-e-even!

00:32.918 --> 00:35.321
Amethyst, that's not funny!

00:35.388 --> 00:39.591
- It was a little funny.
- Regardless, we need to warp back out.

00:39.626 --> 00:42.438
- Can I warp us there?
- We're going underwater.

00:42.473 --> 00:46.414
- And you do need air to breathe.
- Then can I tell all my friends

00:46.449 --> 00:48.500
- I'm the warp master?
- I guess, but ...

00:50.824 --> 00:54.206
I'm the warp master!

00:54.307 --> 00:58.644
- That's nice, Steven.
- Steven...

00:58.712 --> 01:01.614
- You want a doughnut?
- Chocolate jelly, please.

01:03.820 --> 01:06.511
<i>Wha... Huh?
Sadie?! </i>

01:06.546 --> 01:09.688
I, like, just got to sleep!
Now I have to start all over!

01:09.756 --> 01:13.125
Then don't sleep at the counter!
I'm trying to work!

01:13.193 --> 01:16.562
Why don't you not work at the
counter when I'm trying to sleep?!

01:16.630 --> 01:18.186
- You're always doing this!
- Nobody...

01:18.187 --> 01:19.743
Something's
having a bad effect

01:19.744 --> 01:23.329
on their relationship
and their customer service.

01:23.330 --> 01:27.671
- And you could get fired!
- Who cares? I'm sick of this place!

01:27.706 --> 01:29.541
I want to go somewhere new.

01:29.609 --> 01:34.113
- That's it! I'm the warp master!
- Yeah, Steven, I know.

01:34.180 --> 01:35.625
I can take us on vacation ...

01:35.626 --> 01:38.517
somewhere warm and beautiful
and magical for just

01:38.618 --> 01:44.657
- the two of you. And me!
- It could be worth a try.

01:44.724 --> 01:48.727
- We're here! Come on. This way!
- This is way too weird.

01:48.828 --> 01:52.264
- I'm going home.
- No, no! Follow me! You got to see it.

01:52.332 --> 01:55.367
- Come on, Lars. Give it a chance.
- Ugh! Fine.

01:55.435 --> 01:58.637
But if it blows, I'm out of here.

02:02.842 --> 02:07.913
- Welcome to paradise!
- Oh, Steven, it's beautiful here.

02:07.981 --> 02:12.317
- It's a beach. We live on a beach!
- It's a magical beach!

02:12.385 --> 02:15.854
Is that why my phone has no reception?
Why were you even here?

02:15.922 --> 02:20.726
We came here to look for a
dangerous gem creature that we never found.

02:20.794 --> 02:24.987
- Yep. I'm gone.
- Huh? Lars! Wait!

02:25.038 --> 02:28.887
- Lars, this could actually be kind of fun!
- If I'm going to be bored out

02:28.888 --> 02:30.502
of my mind and possibly die, I'm

02:30.570 --> 02:34.606
gonna go to work and get paid for it.
Okay. Where is it?

02:34.674 --> 02:38.477
- What?
- The teleporter thing! Where is it?!

02:38.578 --> 02:43.348
- Oh, it ... it wouldn't disappear, would it?
- No, no, no.

02:43.416 --> 02:45.751
- Well, maybe.
- What?!

02:45.752 --> 02:48.304
It's okay!
The gems'll come save

02:48.305 --> 02:50.856
us when they see I'm
missing... eventually.

02:50.957 --> 02:54.326
Steven, how could you do this?!
We're stranded!

02:54.427 --> 02:58.497
Calm down! Is this the
worst place to be stuck in?

02:58.565 --> 03:02.367
Ugh! You calm down. I'm
gonna find better reception.

03:02.368 --> 03:05.953
Well, I think it's amazing, Steven.

03:05.988 --> 03:08.640
- Nothing!
- Guys, check it out!

03:08.708 --> 03:12.544
I found these rocks
that look like pillows!

03:12.645 --> 03:16.882
- Heh. Good job, Steven.
- My rock's too close to those other rocks.

03:21.006 --> 03:23.995
Sadie, I don't
know what I'm doing wrong.

03:24.030 --> 03:28.247
- Tell me about it.
- You were gonna love it here so much.

03:28.282 --> 03:30.729
- You'd never want to leave.
- Don't worry.

03:30.797 --> 03:34.433
Lars is just a tough nut. He
can't keep up this schtick forever.

03:34.534 --> 03:37.770
I could do without the audio commentary!

03:37.837 --> 03:41.677
- Good night, Sadie.
- Night, Steven.

03:48.141 --> 03:52.651
- Any late lunch, early dinner yet?
- Uh, no luck. What about you?

03:52.752 --> 03:57.222
Mmm...
No. But I can see why.

03:57.323 --> 03:59.431
My bait is too adorable to eat!

03:59.432 --> 04:02.594
Everything on this island has
such a bright, happy smile.

04:04.798 --> 04:08.967
- Ugh! No signal over here, either.
- Hey! Uh, maybe you should

04:09.035 --> 04:16.560
help out if you want to eat!
Grr!

04:16.628 --> 04:19.760
Sadie! We're gonna live!

04:19.795 --> 04:24.573
- I catch, you cook!
- You ain't the boss of me.

04:24.608 --> 04:26.971
Whatever. I don't know.

04:27.039 --> 04:30.041
Looks done to me.
Ooh! Who's first?

04:30.108 --> 04:32.101
Me, me, me!

04:34.847 --> 04:38.082
- It keeps looking at me.
- Maybe it knows it's your

04:38.150 --> 04:45.044
- fault for getting us lost.
- Thank you.

04:48.360 --> 04:52.760
- Mmm. Mmm, Lars, this is really good!
- Hmm?

04:52.795 --> 04:57.683
- You can really cook!
- Heh! Fire ... nature's microwave.

06:52.417 --> 06:57.621
- Did that help?
- No! It's just...

06:57.689 --> 07:03.998

- Oh! You're just really homesick.

07:04.033 --> 07:06.198

07:08.700 --> 07:10.926

07:11.510 --> 07:15.379
We're okay!
 Steven said the gems

07:15.414 --> 07:19.710
could be coming for us any day.
And, you know, until then,

07:19.778 --> 07:27.147
- I got your back.
- Sadie... do you ever get lonely...

- Steven!
- How long have you been watching us?!

07:40.477 --> 07:42.766
- Don't you know what privacy is?!
- People walk in

07:42.867 --> 07:45.219
and out of my room all the time.

07:45.220 --> 07:48.140
Ugh!
I'm gonna go start on the fire.

07:48.175 --> 07:53.061
Hey! You don't have to go!
We're kind of on our own schedule here!

07:55.130 --> 07:56.772
What the heck?!

07:58.277 --> 08:02.686
It's a... gem?

08:04.578 --> 08:07.189
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:10.059 --> 08:13.464
- We have to get out of here!
- Steven!

08:13.531 --> 08:17.725
- What was that thing?!
- It must be what the gems were looking for!

08:17.760 --> 08:21.500
It never left the island
at all! It's invisible.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.502
A big invisible thing is after us?!

08:24.537 --> 08:30.982
I ... I ... I want to go home!
I wanna go home!

08:35.448 --> 08:38.451
- This way!
- Okay!

08:41.342 --> 08:45.849
- It's the warp pad!
- Lars, come on! Let's go home!

08:48.428 --> 08:52.346
- You knew!
- Uh, guys?

08:52.381 --> 08:55.609
It's her fault we've been trapped here!

08:55.644 --> 09:02.061
- Wha-a-a-a-a-at?!
- Look, I panicked! I hid the warp pad!

09:02.096 --> 09:04.176
You were just gonna leave, but
I knew how much you really

09:04.244 --> 09:08.905
needed this! Why don't
you ever let me help you?!

09:08.940 --> 09:10.846
Help me? Are you insane?!

09:10.847 --> 09:15.087
You trapped me on an island
so you could come on to me!

09:16.703 --> 09:19.005
- Ow!
- You kissed me on the mouth!

09:19.006 --> 09:21.516
- No, I didn't!
- Guys, I want to be mad, too,

09:21.529 --> 09:23.905
but can we do it on the warp pad?!

09:23.940 --> 09:27.161
Lars! Oh, gosh.

09:52.756 --> 09:56.408
Sadie!
Use your fish-murdering skills!

10:02.674 --> 10:06.534
Go, Sadie!

10:22.177 --> 10:27.097
Oh. Oh, I got this!
The gems are gonna be so impressed.

10:27.132 --> 10:30.560
We captured
a gem all by ourselves!

10:30.993 --> 10:33.773
Sadie, you were amazing!

10:33.774 --> 10:39.334
Yeah, that was really great
how you, uh... s-saved me.

10:39.402 --> 10:41.392
Don't read into it.

10:42.966 --> 10:45.658
We should do this again sometime.
