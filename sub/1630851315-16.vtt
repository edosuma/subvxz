00:09.792 --> 00:11.750
NATCHEZ:
You're cheating.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.056
SAUGUS: That's a bunch a bull.Oh, why, because you're
above cheating now?

00:13.100 --> 00:14.231
No, because I don't have
to cheat to beat you.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.842
You're picking up
every card I throw.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.584
Bogey's passing.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.848
That's Mance.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.012
Donovan Mance!

00:56.056 --> 00:58.319
FBI! You need to...

00:58.362 --> 00:59.581
[grunting]

01:13.812 --> 01:15.858
[phone ringing]

01:18.948 --> 01:20.993
â™ª

01:31.830 --> 01:34.616
Little last-minute to be
finishing homework, isn't it?

01:34.659 --> 01:37.140
Not due till tomorrow.

01:37.184 --> 01:39.925
Got a game today,
so I'm trying to get ahead.

01:39.969 --> 01:42.232
Impressive.

01:42.276 --> 01:44.495
[laughs]
Try not to sound so surprised.

01:44.539 --> 01:47.716
Haven't seen you
this motivated in a while.[phone chimes]

01:47.759 --> 01:49.848
Shoot. You coming to the game?

01:49.892 --> 01:51.372
That's the plan.

01:51.415 --> 01:52.721
Just promise
you won't give the ump

01:52.764 --> 01:54.897
a hard time again,
okay?

01:54.940 --> 01:56.681
Hey, if he does his job right,

01:56.725 --> 01:58.770
he'll have nothing
to fear from me.

02:10.521 --> 02:13.002
Have you seen my charger?Uh, kitchen counter.

02:16.614 --> 02:19.051
Thanks.

02:19.095 --> 02:21.750
JESSE:
He didn't say anything
about getting recruited?

02:21.793 --> 02:24.187
Why keep it a secret?
Amherst is a great school.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.971
It is a great school.

02:26.015 --> 02:27.669
In Massachusetts.

02:27.712 --> 02:29.671
Ah, he's worried
you'll freak out

02:29.714 --> 02:31.760
about the distance?Maybe.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.805
Is he right?

02:33.849 --> 02:35.851
Honestly, I don't know.

02:35.894 --> 02:38.419
Morning.
Morning.

02:38.462 --> 02:39.898
Whistler.Three days ago,

02:39.942 --> 02:42.336
two FBI agents were
murdered in Pittsburgh.

02:42.379 --> 02:43.859
This is the man
responsible.

02:43.902 --> 02:46.253
Donovan Mance.

02:46.296 --> 02:48.603
JESSE:
Contract killer, right?WHISTLER: Yep.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.953
Willing to kill anyone.
Politicians, judges...

02:50.996 --> 02:52.955
And law enforcement.

02:52.998 --> 02:55.349
Including an NCIS agent,
Gina Bradshaw.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.307
WHISTLER:
Seven years ago,

02:57.351 --> 02:59.701
Bradshaw was building a fraud
case against a contractor.

02:59.744 --> 03:02.617
Both she and her informant
were murdered.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.967
Been off-grid ever since.WHISTLER: Until
he showed up

03:05.010 --> 03:06.664
at one of his old safe houses
in Pittsburgh.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.753
Two agents tried
to apprehend him.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.496
They didn't have a chance.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.368
JESSE: What's his
connection to Hawai'i?

03:14.411 --> 03:16.718
A cell phone was found at
the scene with his prints on it.

03:16.761 --> 03:19.764
There were calls going back
months, but only to one number.

03:19.808 --> 03:22.811
A restaurant here in Honolulu
called Ho'olua.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.378
Who was Mance contacting there?

03:24.421 --> 03:26.075
WHISTLER:
That's what we need
to find out.

03:26.118 --> 03:28.295
I put an affidavit in
for a wiretap.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.384
All right, let's start digging
into Mance and Ho'olua.

03:30.427 --> 03:31.907
We figure out who
he's talking to,

03:31.950 --> 03:33.343
we might get a lead
to Mance himself.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.737
Find out where he is
or where he's going.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.263
[keypad beeps, lock clicks]

03:43.005 --> 03:45.137
[door closes]

03:45.181 --> 03:46.835
You okay there, brah?

03:46.878 --> 03:49.577
Trying to imagine lemongrass-
scented lobster claw meat

03:49.620 --> 03:52.667
served with a fricassee
of Kahuku sweet corn

03:52.710 --> 03:54.103
and Serrano ham.

03:54.146 --> 03:55.626
Oh. [laughs]

03:55.670 --> 03:57.672
Going down the Ho'olua
rabbit hole?

03:57.715 --> 03:58.847
Yeah.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.849
Looks fancy.Sophisticated.

04:00.892 --> 04:03.286
Not necessarily fancy.
Upscale French bistro

04:03.330 --> 04:06.985
with some Hawaiian zing
and using all local ingredients.

04:07.029 --> 04:09.118
Right now, we're more interested
in their phone line

04:09.161 --> 04:11.468
and employees.Right. [chuckles]

04:11.512 --> 04:13.296
[computer beeps]Unfortunately,

04:13.340 --> 04:15.211
the number Mance called
is Ho'olua's landline.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.909
Probably has multiple extensions
throughout the restaurant.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.084
So he could've been
talking to anyone

04:19.128 --> 04:20.521
from front-of-house

04:20.564 --> 04:22.653
to kitchen staff.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.180
Ho'olua's been opened up
ten months.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.530
A success out of the gate.

04:29.573 --> 04:32.272
And all thanks
to Head Chef Jenny Alika.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.577
She's local?

04:33.621 --> 04:34.926
Born and raised
on the Big Island.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.711
But she'd been gone for years.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.582
Studied at Le Cordon Bleu
in France

04:38.626 --> 04:40.628
and the Culinary Institute
in New York.

04:40.671 --> 04:44.153
That's where she met
business partner, Chris Polis.

04:44.196 --> 04:47.112
Either of them have ties
to Donovan Mance or Pittsburgh?

04:47.156 --> 04:48.636
Uh, not that
I've found yet.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.202
Okay, what about
the rest of the staff?

04:50.246 --> 04:52.292
Ah.
[clears throat]

04:52.335 --> 04:53.989
A handful have criminal records,

04:54.032 --> 04:56.252
the odd felony here and there,
but no one stands out.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.080
If we start
questioning them,

04:58.123 --> 05:00.343
we could scare off
whoever Mance was talking to.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.476
So we need a subtle approach.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.129
Someone goes in undercover.

05:04.173 --> 05:06.131
Gets the lay of the land.But...

05:07.698 --> 05:09.831
...this is a fine dining
restaurant, who's gonna go in?

05:10.832 --> 05:12.050
Me.

05:12.094 --> 05:13.443
As what, a busboy?Porter?

05:13.487 --> 05:14.705
Oh, coat check?Valet.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.228
No.

05:16.272 --> 05:18.230
As a cook.

05:18.274 --> 05:20.320
You have to be pretty talented
to work in that kitchen.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.583
I'm pretty talented.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.367
How can you even get a
job there that quickly?

05:24.411 --> 05:26.151
I know a guy.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.726
[whistles]

05:35.770 --> 05:37.249
[Inoki barks]

05:37.293 --> 05:39.426
Hey, come here, buddy.

05:39.469 --> 05:42.037
Hello.
It's good to see you, too.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.214
Where's Pop?

05:45.257 --> 05:46.737
Huh? Where's Pop? Come on.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.742
Kai.

05:51.786 --> 05:53.396
[laughs]

05:53.440 --> 05:55.224
Inoki missed you last weekend.

05:55.267 --> 05:56.747
Yeah, I know.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.358
I'm sorry, I just...

05:58.401 --> 06:00.316
I got swamped on a case.Yeah, no matter.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.926
Hey, how about you make
the poke?

06:01.970 --> 06:03.406
Mom always loved yours.

06:03.450 --> 06:06.191
Poke? What for?Mom's birthday.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.280
We're making her favorite meals
for the 'ohana.

06:08.324 --> 06:10.544
You here to plan the menu, yeah?

06:11.980 --> 06:14.069
You still do that?Every year.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.984
First one you're back.
It's a big deal.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.377
I won't be doing that.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.422
Course you will.
It's for your mom.
No.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.250
No, th-that's for you.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.339
To make you feel better.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.472
How long you gonna
stay mad at me?

06:25.515 --> 06:26.951
I'm not mad.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.431
I'm just not taking part in this

06:28.475 --> 06:30.564
loving-husband fantasy
you created. No.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.479
You know how much I loved her.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.785
Yeah, now.

06:34.829 --> 06:37.614
After she's gone,
when it doesn't matter.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.401
You got a cruel streak, son.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.403
You want to cook for
Mom, you want to have

06:43.446 --> 06:45.666
a party?
Yeah, go ahead, be my guest.

06:45.709 --> 06:48.756
But that doesn't make up for you
checking out when she got sick.

06:48.799 --> 06:50.888
I didn't.No, let's not.

06:50.932 --> 06:53.021
Hey, what you want from me, Kai?

06:53.064 --> 06:54.718
I've been trying
to make things right.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.764
I'm giving you space,
looking out for Inoki...

06:56.807 --> 06:58.069
Hey, I can take him
somewhere else if it's

06:58.113 --> 06:59.419
too much trouble.
Nah, I'll do that.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.508
That's not what I'm saying!

07:01.551 --> 07:03.814
You're so stubborn!Yeah.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.034
And I'm cruel.

07:07.992 --> 07:10.473
I wonder who I got that from?

07:10.517 --> 07:12.301
Mom...

07:12.344 --> 07:14.956
wouldn't want us to fight.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.740
Tell me what to do

07:16.784 --> 07:18.438
to make this right.

07:22.311 --> 07:25.009
What I need right
now is a job.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.098
I'm going undercover.

07:28.709 --> 07:31.363
I need a recommendation
from Wally's to get the gig.

07:31.407 --> 07:34.149
You still know everyone, right?

07:34.192 --> 07:35.411
There isn't a kitchen
on this island

07:35.455 --> 07:36.847
doesn't have one of my guys.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.502
See, the key is...

07:39.546 --> 07:42.157
I'm not your son.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.072
Just someone you're
trying to help out.

07:44.115 --> 07:45.987
I understand.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.645
[crowd cheering]

07:51.688 --> 07:53.864
Go! Go!Come on! Come on! Come on!

07:55.170 --> 07:56.476
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.483
Out!

08:03.526 --> 08:06.007
Nice! Nice! All right, Alex!

08:06.050 --> 08:07.878
What a play!

08:09.489 --> 08:11.316
Everything okay?

08:11.360 --> 08:13.188
Uh, you know,
Caitlyn wants vitamins

08:13.231 --> 08:15.669
and massage oil

08:15.712 --> 08:17.584
and the loose leaf
peppermint tea

08:17.627 --> 08:19.063
from the good tea shop,
not the bad one.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.674
And I'm supposed to know
which one is which.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.327
I don't remember you running
all over town for me

08:22.371 --> 08:23.807
when I was pregnant.You never asked.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.461
[bat clinks]

08:28.159 --> 08:29.900
Yes, nice!Yeah!

08:29.944 --> 08:31.380
Nice!

08:31.423 --> 08:33.208
I get why Amherst wants him.

08:33.251 --> 08:36.124
It's okay.
I saw the letter.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.781
Amherst sent a letter,
recruiting Alex?

08:40.824 --> 08:43.131
I just assumed
he told you.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.744
I guess he kept both
of us in the dark.

08:47.788 --> 08:50.355
He's not really
considering it?

08:50.399 --> 08:51.792
I don't know.
We haven't...

08:51.835 --> 08:54.229
Because it's-it's
not happening.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.796
Daniel?

08:55.839 --> 08:57.232
I've seen too many players
from my teams

08:57.275 --> 08:59.756
go off to school and just,
they fall apart.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.542
Sure, but...Far from home,
no support system.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.587
That's not our kid.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.590
You have no idea.

09:07.634 --> 09:10.201
I don't love it, either,

09:10.245 --> 09:13.248
okay,
but we need to talk to Alex.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.293
Nothing to talk about.
Amherst is off the table.

09:15.337 --> 09:16.817
[phone ringing]Damn it.

09:16.860 --> 09:19.471
I got to go.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.343
[exhales]

09:21.386 --> 09:24.302
Hey! Yeah, I'm headed
to the store now.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.002
[crowd cheering]

09:31.222 --> 09:33.355
All right, buddy!

09:39.883 --> 09:42.712
Hey, hey, I need
last night's receipts.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.714
Hello?I don't work here...

09:44.758 --> 09:46.324
Well, then you're not
much help to me, are you?

09:46.368 --> 09:48.196
Hey, I need-- can you just...?I actually...

09:48.239 --> 09:49.893
I need last night's receipts,
can you pull those up...

09:49.937 --> 09:51.939
Don't mind Chris. He's opening
up two more locations.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.811
Doesn't know which way is up.
Ryan Delucci, sous chef.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.639
Assuming you're KJ?Yeah.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.423
You really impressed
your old bosses.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.295
Got three local chefs
singing your praises.

10:00.338 --> 10:02.079
Hope they didn't
oversell me.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.515
They better not have.
Our chef's brilliant,

10:03.559 --> 10:05.082
but she's tough.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.780
Lost two guys last week
who couldn't hack it.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.782
She'll make the call.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.610
I mean, you see
that, don't you?

10:10.653 --> 10:13.047
The cubes are all different
sizes. I specified

10:13.090 --> 10:15.310
a Brunoise cut.No problem, Chef.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.486
We'll get it right.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.183
Is this the new guy?

10:19.227 --> 10:21.098
Not till you say so, Chef.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.013
Let's see a Brunoise.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.366
[knife chopping]

10:35.635 --> 10:37.288
There you go, Chef.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.986
Well, keep going.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.770
You're already behind.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.642
Guys, there should be one more
person on the line for me.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.208
That means you're hired.

10:44.252 --> 10:46.297
Keep dicing.Okay.

10:48.952 --> 10:51.259
HARVEY: You need
specialty products.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.000
I can get those, too.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.655
You've bought from me
before, haven't you?

10:55.698 --> 10:57.613
I never forget a face.

11:00.921 --> 11:03.706
This should cover it.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.229
Yeah?

11:05.273 --> 11:06.883
[snaps fingers]I got it.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.232
Donovan, right?

11:08.276 --> 11:09.886
Mance.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.888
Thought you
were dead.

11:11.932 --> 11:14.151
You don't have
to worry about me.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.893
I won't tell nobody.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.896
[grunts]

11:22.116 --> 11:24.466
I know you won't.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.743
[birds chirping]

11:53.756 --> 11:55.758
[indistinct radio chatter]

11:57.107 --> 11:58.979
Bad news, boss.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.416
Gurneys and crime scene tape
aren't ever good news.

12:01.459 --> 12:03.418
Donovan Mance is
here in Hawai'i.

12:03.461 --> 12:04.985
We've got
confirmation?

12:05.028 --> 12:06.726
HPD got a partial
off the door.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.119
It matches the print
on file for Mance.BOLO's out?

12:09.163 --> 12:10.555
Yeah, I gave Kai
a heads-up

12:10.599 --> 12:12.209
in case Mance shows up
at the restaurant.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.298
Who's the victim?Harvey Colms.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.083
Local gun dealer
and all-around lowlife.

12:16.126 --> 12:18.476
According to HPD, he's been
in business here for years.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.826
And Mance knew
how to reach out to him.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.479
Might mean he's familiar
with the island.

12:21.523 --> 12:22.742
It also means he's armed.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.266
And already leaving
a body count.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.272
Puree's done, Chef.

12:31.315 --> 12:33.753
Nice. Take your five,
then hit the line.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.363
Yes, sir.

12:49.899 --> 12:52.162
[line rings]

12:52.206 --> 12:54.164
There he is.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.731
The man behind the woman

12:55.775 --> 12:58.212
behind the finest
Foie Gras Musubi

12:58.255 --> 12:59.517
I've ever tasted.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.737
Hey, is it true
that she raises her own ducks?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.347
Ernie, I've barely
been here a day,

13:03.391 --> 13:04.522
and I've been kind of distracted

13:04.566 --> 13:06.263
searching for a killer.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.091
But I have seen at least
three phone extensions.

13:08.135 --> 13:10.441
One out front, one in the
kitchen, one in the office.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.574
The last call
from the restaurant

13:12.617 --> 13:14.445
to Mance's cell was
this past Thursday.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.404
Can you get me a work schedule
from that day?

13:18.580 --> 13:20.016
Got it.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.761
[camera clicks]

13:27.241 --> 13:28.938
Sending it to you now.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.592
I'll see if I can find
any connections to Mance.

13:30.635 --> 13:33.421
Hey, Kai... be careful.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.293
Always.

13:56.052 --> 13:58.098
DELUCCI:
Hey! Break's over.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.274
We're getting behind.

14:00.317 --> 14:03.320
Yeah. Yeah.

14:03.364 --> 14:04.844
WHISTLER:
Wiretap's up.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.106
We got a couple workers
laying bets with a bookie.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.672
One calling her pot dealer.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.892
But no calls involving
Donovan Mance.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.677
Wait, so we still don't know
why he's here?

14:12.721 --> 14:14.201
He's a hitman.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.072
I'm assuming he's here for work.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.422
He's a hitman
who's been in hiding

14:18.466 --> 14:20.990
and on the run for years.
I wouldn't assume anything.

14:21.034 --> 14:23.775
TENNANT:
Plus we have 20 phone calls into
his cell over the last year.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.560
Just feels a little more
personal than business.

14:25.603 --> 14:27.214
And Kai hasn't found any leads?

14:27.257 --> 14:29.303
He's been there less than a day.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.871
Yes, Lucy. I know.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.917
I'm just asking
if he found

14:34.961 --> 14:36.527
any leads
in that day?

14:36.571 --> 14:38.921
Nothing yet.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.923
How about you?

14:40.967 --> 14:43.186
Figure out if Mance
ever pulled jobs in Hawai'i?

14:43.230 --> 14:45.580
Not that FBI could prove.

14:45.623 --> 14:47.364
But he was suspected
of working for The Company

14:47.408 --> 14:49.018
back in the early '90s.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.325
Like the CIA?TENNANT: No,
like the gang.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.501
The Company ran organized crime
in Hawai'i for decades.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.155
Got broken up
a couple years ago.

14:55.198 --> 14:56.852
We've had reports that some
of the younger members

14:56.896 --> 14:58.941
of the original syndicate
are trying to rebuild.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.682
Maybe they're involved
in the restaurant.

15:00.725 --> 15:03.424
Might fit with what I found.

15:03.467 --> 15:06.166
There's a lot of money flowing
into Ho'olua.

15:06.209 --> 15:07.819
Two new locations
for a restaurant

15:07.863 --> 15:09.647
that's been open
less than a year.

15:09.691 --> 15:12.346
Okay, what do we know about
Chef Alika's business partner?

15:14.391 --> 15:16.828
Chris Polis got

15:16.872 --> 15:19.353
an MBA at Columbia.
He met Alika in New York.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.094
Any connections
to criminal organizations?

15:21.137 --> 15:22.747
None through
his family.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.533
They're well off,
but it's all legit.

15:25.576 --> 15:27.187
Let's have Ernie see
if he can find out who's funding

15:27.230 --> 15:28.710
the restaurant's expansion,
and make sure Kai's aware

15:28.753 --> 15:30.233
of the possible connection
to The Company.

15:37.588 --> 15:38.894
[clears throat]

15:38.938 --> 15:41.114
So this is
the new normal?

15:41.157 --> 15:43.377
Chasing
violent fugitives?

15:43.420 --> 15:45.335
You in our office all the time.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.511
It is part of the job.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.078
Is that okay?

15:49.122 --> 15:50.906
Yep. Okay for you?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.952
Yep.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.401
Don't forget
the kukui nut powder.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.013
We can't serve this,
it's already turning.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.059
86 the branzino.Heard, Chef.

16:15.757 --> 16:17.802
I'll be back.

16:21.763 --> 16:24.157
â™ª

16:50.922 --> 16:53.142
â™ª

17:10.768 --> 17:12.161
What do you think
you're doing?

17:12.205 --> 17:13.467
I just, I had to...

17:13.510 --> 17:14.816
You don't ever
leave the line

17:14.859 --> 17:16.470
in my kitchen
without permission.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.167
Understood, Chef.
It won't happen again.

17:18.211 --> 17:20.387
Damn right. You're fired.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.476
Pack up.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.266
POLIS:
This isn't gonna help anything!

17:30.310 --> 17:32.181
ANDERS:
We're not here to help.

17:32.225 --> 17:33.922
I'm doing everything I can here!

17:33.965 --> 17:35.402
And you're still not delivering.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.447
Consider this an incentive.

17:37.491 --> 17:38.753
[grunts]

17:38.796 --> 17:41.147
Hey! Leave him alone.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.757
Walk away.
This isn't your business.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.628
All right, I'm calling the cops.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.717
You don't listen, do you?

17:48.023 --> 17:50.417
Hey, I don't want to do this.

17:54.247 --> 17:57.163
[grunting]

17:57.206 --> 17:58.512
You should've walked.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.703
ANDERS:
You're screwed, Polis.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.792
So is your friend.

18:19.272 --> 18:21.404
You okay?

18:21.448 --> 18:23.450
No.

18:23.493 --> 18:26.453
You just signed
my death warrant.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.897
JENNY: What the hell have
you gotten us into, Chris?

18:35.940 --> 18:38.117
It's not my fault!JENNY: One of our employees
just got his ass kicked

18:38.160 --> 18:40.597
standing up for you!Yeah, and that probably
made things worse.

18:40.641 --> 18:41.903
You got to sign the papers!JENNY: I am not having
this discussion.

18:51.695 --> 18:56.309
I'm... I'm sorry
that you got hurt.

18:56.352 --> 18:59.225
I'm grateful that
you helped Chris.

18:59.268 --> 19:00.661
Look, who are those guys?

19:00.704 --> 19:02.750
Nothing I can't handle.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.189
Come back tomorrow.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.712
You get one more chance.
If you want it.

19:08.756 --> 19:10.192
Yeah.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.544
Thank you, Chef.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.771
You went through my things?

19:23.814 --> 19:25.686
TENNANT:
It's not like I was snooping.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.601
You left it out.

19:27.644 --> 19:29.646
If I wanted you to know...

19:29.690 --> 19:30.908
I would've told you.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.736
Well, that's the question, Alex.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.216
Why were you hiding it?

19:34.260 --> 19:35.826
I wasn't hiding it.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.785
I was thinking about it.

19:37.828 --> 19:38.960
'Cause you're considering going?

19:39.003 --> 19:41.354
I mean, yeah. It's Amherst.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.704
All right, I kind of freaked
when I got it.

19:43.747 --> 19:46.272
It's far, but...It's too far.

19:46.315 --> 19:47.664
We're listening,
remember?

19:47.708 --> 19:49.188
That was your idea, not mine.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.888
It is a long way from home.

19:53.931 --> 19:55.368
I was, I was thinking about

19:55.411 --> 19:57.326
how you traveled a lot
when we were little.

19:57.370 --> 20:00.111
It wasn't easy being apart.No.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.113
But you did it.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.551
And it didn't mean
you loved us any less.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.512
I think I could do it, too.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.821
I think I want to.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.997
What about UH?

20:16.040 --> 20:18.217
The coach there
expressed interest.

20:20.044 --> 20:22.395
Yeah, it's not like
I've made a decision.

20:22.438 --> 20:24.745
Whatever you decide.

20:24.788 --> 20:27.617
We love that you have options.

20:27.661 --> 20:30.141
You've worked really
hard this year.

20:30.185 --> 20:31.795
You've earned this.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.190
Why am I not surprised?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.366
[scoffs]Dad?

20:37.410 --> 20:39.281
Dad, why are you so upset?
I haven't decided.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.283
I've got
to go to work.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.198
He's got a lot going on, okay?
Just give it a beat.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.940
Hey, I know you got a lot with
the new baby coming and all...

20:45.983 --> 20:48.159
No, this has nothing
to do with the baby, Jane.

20:48.203 --> 20:49.552
And the fact
that you don't even know

20:49.596 --> 20:51.250
what's wrong
tells me everything.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.295
I got to go.

20:53.339 --> 20:56.124
[door opens, closes]

20:57.168 --> 20:58.909
TENNANT:
FBI still hasn't intercepted

20:58.953 --> 21:01.303
any calls between Mance
and the restaurant.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.740
No more sightings of him,
either.

21:03.784 --> 21:06.700
What about identifying the men
who threatened Chris Polis?

21:06.743 --> 21:08.484
Ernie used the photo Kai took.

21:08.528 --> 21:10.399
Roy Anders and Brett Watts.

21:10.443 --> 21:12.401
Long rap sheets--
aggravated battery,

21:12.445 --> 21:14.838
assault with a deadly weapon.JESSE:
They're just muscle.

21:14.882 --> 21:17.363
No active affiliations,
but they're working for someone.

21:17.406 --> 21:20.366
Cash Kai found at Ho'olua's
most likely drug money.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.542
JESSE:
Yeah, high-traffic business
and construction

21:22.585 --> 21:25.458
on two new projects-- I mean,
it's perfect for laundering.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.938
Someone's financing
Ho'olua's expansion.

21:27.982 --> 21:29.897
Any idea who?

21:29.940 --> 21:31.725
Public record

21:31.768 --> 21:35.424
says it's a group called
Envision Investments, but...

21:35.468 --> 21:37.208
Envision's just a shell company.

21:37.252 --> 21:39.341
All right, we need to figure
out who's actually in charge.

21:39.385 --> 21:41.822
Check HPD Narcotics and DEA.

21:41.865 --> 21:44.346
See if Anders and Watts have any
connection to known dealers.

21:45.391 --> 21:48.176
Uh, Chris Polis has been
negotiating the deal.

21:48.219 --> 21:49.743
He knows the guys
who beat him up.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.135
He must know who
they work for.

21:51.179 --> 21:53.094
We could keep
an eye on Polis.

21:53.137 --> 21:55.792
Discreetly.
Might lead us to Mance.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.272
Good idea.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.361
Do it. I'm gonna check on Kai.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.760
Ouch.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.938
Looks painful.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.374
Worth it.

22:12.418 --> 22:13.984
Got me my job back.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.551
Your job is
to stay safe.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.466
No, I'm good.
I'm good, boss, promise.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.773
And find us leads.Yeah.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.775
I beat the crap
out of two leads.

22:21.818 --> 22:23.777
Yes, you did.
And we're on them.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.387
You doing okay
in the kitchen?

22:25.431 --> 22:27.389
Yeah, I'm...

22:27.433 --> 22:28.999
I'm doing great actually.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.001
I forgot how much
I enjoyed it.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.221
Your dad taught you well.

22:33.264 --> 22:35.310
Pissed me off half the time.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.833
But yeah.

22:36.877 --> 22:38.922
Pop and I enjoyed
cooking together.

22:38.966 --> 22:40.576
I mean, it's maybe the only time

22:40.620 --> 22:42.883
we were in sync.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.754
He must love
having you back home.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.365
Well, love is a strong word.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.975
We don't get along that much.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.585
Not anymore.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.195
Family's
complicated.

22:51.239 --> 22:53.284
No argument there.

22:53.328 --> 22:55.025
Kai?

22:56.244 --> 22:58.289
Try not to get
in any more fights, okay?

22:58.333 --> 23:00.335
Maybe talk
to Chef Alika instead.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.381
See how much she knows
about the money laundering.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.600
I mean, I'll try, but...

23:04.644 --> 23:06.515
I don't think
she likes me much.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.648
She doesn't know you like I do.

23:13.957 --> 23:16.395
LUCY:
That's one of the new
Ho'oula locations.

23:24.272 --> 23:27.231
[indistinct chatter]

23:27.275 --> 23:29.582
LUCY:
Polis reminds me
of my older brother.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.497
All flash, no bang.

23:31.540 --> 23:32.976
Hopefully your
older brother

23:33.020 --> 23:34.630
isn't involved
with drug dealers.

23:34.674 --> 23:37.372
Investment bankers.
Close enough.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.461
[chuckles]

23:39.505 --> 23:41.289
That's 'cause I'm, like,
I'm two steps away.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.465
Okay, so just hold
on one second.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.902
We're not the only ones
following him.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.469
Hey, Polis?

23:47.513 --> 23:49.471
Uh, I got to call you
right back.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.038
What's up?

23:51.081 --> 23:53.475
Oh, my God!
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

23:53.519 --> 23:56.391
LUCY:
If we confront those guys,
we risk blowing Kai's cover.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.958
Can't let them kill him, either.

24:01.309 --> 24:02.963
Keep out of sight.

24:07.358 --> 24:09.230
I'm not gonna lie.
This is gonna hurt.Huh?

24:09.273 --> 24:12.102
One finger
for every day you stalled.

24:12.146 --> 24:14.496
No, no... wait, wait, wait!Mr. Polis!

24:14.540 --> 24:17.020
Sorry I'm late. I'm Ms. Hastings

24:17.064 --> 24:19.719
with the Department
of Planning and Permitting.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.547
For the inspection?

24:21.590 --> 24:23.157
Uh... yeah.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.594
Ah, let's hope this one goes
better than the last one.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.030
Right, I'm so--

24:27.074 --> 24:28.597
I'm, I got to do this.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.860
Sorry.

24:30.904 --> 24:32.949
I'll see you.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.084
Yeah, I actually don't
have time to do this.

24:37.127 --> 24:39.260
You're gonna need
to make time.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.568
Thank God your agent was there.

24:42.611 --> 24:43.917
Can you believe
I'm from New York

24:43.960 --> 24:44.874
and I've never been mugged
before?

24:44.918 --> 24:46.572
"Mugged"?

24:46.615 --> 24:48.095
POLIS: Oh, yeah,
it was terrible.

24:48.138 --> 24:50.271
They wanted my watch, my money.

24:50.314 --> 24:51.751
And what did they want
last night

24:51.794 --> 24:53.535
when they assaulted you
at Ho'olua?

24:53.579 --> 24:55.363
Maybe they know that, uh,

24:55.406 --> 24:56.756
my family's wealthy.

24:56.799 --> 24:59.062
Or maybe...

24:59.106 --> 25:00.803
because you're using
your restaurant

25:00.847 --> 25:02.501
to launder their drug money.

25:03.719 --> 25:05.547
What?

25:05.591 --> 25:07.810
No.We know about the boxes

25:07.854 --> 25:10.117
of cash they keep
in your storage room.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.380
At the least,
you're an accessory.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.600
That's a felony, Chris.

25:14.643 --> 25:17.428
Your best bet is to cooperate.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.430
And let us help you.

25:20.780 --> 25:23.739
Yeah, well, there's
nothing to help with, so...

25:23.783 --> 25:25.436
We know you and Jenny Alika
are being pressured

25:25.480 --> 25:27.134
into signing papers.

25:27.177 --> 25:28.831
Just tell us who's
calling the shots.

25:28.875 --> 25:31.094
We can offer you protection.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.924
No, you can't.

25:48.416 --> 25:49.983
Hey, Chef.

25:50.026 --> 25:51.593
You were waiting
in your car for me?

25:51.637 --> 25:53.116
Uh...

25:53.160 --> 25:54.596
I-I was hoping
to get a word alone.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.598
Chatting me up will
not keep your job.

25:56.642 --> 25:57.860
Doing excellent work will.

25:57.904 --> 26:00.254
Hey, I just wanted
to say thank you.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.386
For, um, giving me
a second chance.

26:03.779 --> 26:05.433
Convince me I made
the right decision.

26:05.476 --> 26:08.001
I will, I will.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.134
So, Ho'olua?

26:11.178 --> 26:13.572
The north wind.
Why'd you choose that one?

26:14.573 --> 26:16.662
Just liked it.

26:16.705 --> 26:19.316
North wind blows in strong,
and then moves on.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.797
I'm guessing that's you.

26:21.841 --> 26:23.712
Uh, it has been.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.758
Traveled where
the work was.

26:26.846 --> 26:29.762
Home does have a way
of pulling you back though, huh?

26:29.805 --> 26:32.416
I'm not sure how long
all this is gonna last.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.723
It's 'cause
of those guys, right?

26:34.767 --> 26:36.682
The ones who gave Chris
a hard time.

26:36.725 --> 26:38.335
You know, I really
can't talk about it.

26:38.379 --> 26:40.294
Okay.[engines revving]

26:40.337 --> 26:42.122
Hey, stop.

26:42.165 --> 26:44.211
Listen, I-I appreciate you being
my knight in shining armor...

26:44.254 --> 26:45.908
Move, move, move, move![screams]

26:45.952 --> 26:47.301
Oh, my God!

26:48.694 --> 26:50.304
You're coming with us.

26:50.347 --> 26:51.740
Should've done this last night.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.263
[gunshots]

26:53.307 --> 26:55.526
Move! Move!

26:55.570 --> 26:57.050
JENNY:
Hey, wait, wait, Dad!

26:57.093 --> 26:59.139
No, Dad!

27:05.362 --> 27:07.669
Dad, please put down the gun.

27:07.713 --> 27:08.931
He's not one of them?

27:08.975 --> 27:11.673
I'm a cook, sir.
I work in her kitchen.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.109
I-I was just
trying to help.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.810
You okay, Jenny?

27:17.853 --> 27:19.725
You killed them.Yeah, they were gonna hurt you.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.248
It's the reason you called me.

27:21.291 --> 27:24.468
No, I called you
for advice, Dad.

27:24.512 --> 27:26.253
I-I wanted you to listen,
not this!

27:26.296 --> 27:28.342
[distant sirens wailing]

27:29.952 --> 27:31.867
I know how these things work.

27:31.911 --> 27:33.608
Advice won't cut it.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.480
I'll take care
of the rest.

27:41.703 --> 27:42.965
[panting][line rings]

27:43.009 --> 27:45.011
This is NCIS Special
Agent Kai Holman.

27:45.054 --> 27:46.665
I need a bus
and all available units

27:46.708 --> 27:48.362
to 607 Koa Avenue.

27:48.405 --> 27:50.973
Armed suspect, fleeing north.

27:51.017 --> 27:53.410
You're a cop?

27:58.720 --> 28:00.635
JENNY:
He did this?

28:00.679 --> 28:02.637
And many others.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.465
You didn't know?

28:04.508 --> 28:06.859
That my father
was a monster?

28:06.902 --> 28:08.948
No.

28:13.430 --> 28:16.129
He's not listed
on your birth certificate.

28:16.172 --> 28:18.044
Mom said it was
because he was...

28:18.087 --> 28:20.481
some sort of criminal.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.352
How long have you two
been in touch?

28:22.396 --> 28:23.789
I don't know.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.747
Uh, since I left
for culinary school.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.054
He reached out to you?No, I did.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.533
I was in France.

28:29.577 --> 28:31.318
I was on my own, I was lonely.

28:31.361 --> 28:33.363
I had a... old
number of his.

28:33.407 --> 28:35.801
And I called it,
and he picked up.

28:35.844 --> 28:37.933
The same number you called
from the restaurant?

28:39.892 --> 28:42.590
We found your father's phone.You know, we weren't
really close.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.810
But you called him last week?

28:44.853 --> 28:46.681
After I argued with Chris.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.117
And you told him you
had a problem?

28:48.161 --> 28:50.250
I just, I told him
what was going on.

28:50.293 --> 28:51.773
That these guys were
pressuring us.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.735
I didn't ask him to come here.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.084
TENNANT:
No one's accusing you.

28:58.127 --> 29:00.739
But you need to tell us
what's going on.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.873
[sighs]

29:08.703 --> 29:12.228
Chris brought in an
investor a few months ago.

29:12.272 --> 29:14.404
A silent partner
with a lot of money,

29:14.448 --> 29:16.363
who wanted to expand
the restaurant.

29:16.406 --> 29:17.799
What's the partner's name?

29:17.843 --> 29:19.540
I don't know.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.107
Chris said he ran
some sort of, like, a...

29:21.150 --> 29:23.152
a private equity group.

29:23.196 --> 29:26.286
I could tell something was off,
but Chris took the money, so...

29:26.329 --> 29:28.549
suddenly these guys are just,

29:28.592 --> 29:30.812
they're in our place
all the time...

29:30.856 --> 29:32.466
just doing God knows what.

29:32.509 --> 29:33.815
They're laundering money.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.904
Yeah.

29:37.514 --> 29:39.299
Yeah, I figured that out
when Chris told me

29:39.342 --> 29:40.866
we had to sign over

29:40.909 --> 29:42.824
controlling interest of Ho'olua.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.347
And he didn't mention a name?

29:44.391 --> 29:46.088
Or anything?

29:46.132 --> 29:49.135
Anything that might help us
identify the investor?

29:49.178 --> 29:51.006
Because if we don't
find him quickly,

29:51.050 --> 29:52.660
your father will.

29:54.314 --> 29:55.358
[knock on glass]

29:56.707 --> 29:58.318
Excuse me.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.017
You find something?

30:02.061 --> 30:04.193
Maybe. I was running
known associates

30:04.237 --> 30:06.456
of the men Mance shot,
trying to figure out

30:06.500 --> 30:09.285
who they were working for,
and I found this guy.

30:10.678 --> 30:13.899
Alonzo Descanso.

30:13.942 --> 30:16.075
Arrested multiple times
for drug trafficking.

30:16.118 --> 30:19.121
Yeah, in 2004,
both Descanso and Roy Anders

30:19.165 --> 30:20.949
were arrested
for moving cocaine.

30:20.993 --> 30:22.821
They served
five years together.

30:22.864 --> 30:25.780
When Descanso got out,
he got back to business.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.260
This is good, Ernie.

30:27.303 --> 30:29.001
You have an address
for Descanso?

30:29.044 --> 30:30.741
Mm, that's the problem.

30:30.785 --> 30:32.482
He stays under the radar,
moves around a lot.

30:32.526 --> 30:34.006
I can't locate him.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.008
Any sign of Mance?No.

30:36.051 --> 30:38.532
Guy kills two men
in broad daylight and somehow

30:38.575 --> 30:39.968
evades a hundred cops
searching for him.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.361
You get anything from the chef?

30:41.404 --> 30:42.884
Only one who seems
to know anything

30:42.928 --> 30:44.451
is her business partner,
and he's not talking.

30:44.494 --> 30:46.888
Does he understand
he's facing serious prison time?

30:46.932 --> 30:48.934
Doesn't scare him
as much as Descanso.

30:50.457 --> 30:52.067
I bet I know
what'll scare him more.

30:55.244 --> 30:56.680
[door opens]

30:56.724 --> 30:59.205
Oh! I've been here

30:59.248 --> 31:01.816
for, like, 12 hours!
No food, no water.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.209
You've been here,
like, four hours.

31:03.252 --> 31:04.732
And we asked if
you were hungry.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.386
You can't hold me like this.

31:06.429 --> 31:08.605
Actually... we can.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.303
Uh-uh, I know my rights.

31:10.346 --> 31:12.740
If you don't charge me,
you got to release me.

31:12.783 --> 31:15.351
You don't want that.Yeah, you wouldn't
be safe out there.

31:15.395 --> 31:17.919
Well, you know what,
I'm gonna take my chances.

31:17.963 --> 31:20.313
He thinks he can handle himself.

31:20.356 --> 31:22.184
He could barely handle
Descanso's guys.

31:22.228 --> 31:24.491
Mance will
eat him alive.

31:24.534 --> 31:27.059
Wh-Who's Mance?

31:27.102 --> 31:28.930
He is the one

31:28.974 --> 31:31.541
who did this
to your buddies.

31:34.153 --> 31:36.590
He's the most wanted hitman
in the country.

31:36.633 --> 31:38.113
And he's going around
killing everyone involved

31:38.157 --> 31:40.333
in your little
money laundering operation.

31:40.376 --> 31:43.510
And our guess is that you

31:43.553 --> 31:46.252
and Descanso are
next on his list.

31:46.295 --> 31:49.081
[stammers]
But I don't even work with Al.

31:49.124 --> 31:50.560
I'm a victim here.

31:50.604 --> 31:52.214
Well, you sure aren't
acting like a victim.

31:52.258 --> 31:55.043
Covering for Descanso.
Profiting from his crimes.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.915
Though I'm curious
how you got connected

31:56.958 --> 31:58.829
to a known drug trafficker.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.744
It wasn't me.

32:00.788 --> 32:02.964
It was frickin' Ryan.Delucci?

32:03.008 --> 32:05.271
Your sous chef?Ryan knew Descanso

32:05.314 --> 32:06.881
from back East,
said he was good people.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.666
I should've known it
was too good to be true.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.799
Do you know how hard it is to
raise money for a restaurant?

32:11.842 --> 32:13.627
We don't care, okay?
All we care about

32:13.670 --> 32:15.455
is keeping you alive,
and stopping Mance.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.326
Tell us where
to find Al Descanso.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.415
Or none
of that will happen.

32:27.249 --> 32:29.077
Like we planned.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.564
Federal agents!Hands where we can see them!

32:37.607 --> 32:40.480
Hands up! FBI!DESCANSO:
You're wasting your time.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.177
Nothing illegal to find here.

32:42.221 --> 32:43.918
Not looking
for evidence.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.485
Just taking out
the garbage.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.791
You got these dirtbags
involved in Jenny's restaurant?

32:47.835 --> 32:49.358
I never meant...DESCANSO:
Shut up, Ryan.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.099
Don't open your mouth.
My lawyers

32:51.143 --> 32:52.318
will have us out
in two hours.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.015
Good.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.757
Donovan Mance will know exactly
where to meet you.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.674
Donovan Mance is alive?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.463
I'll call Tennant, let her know

33:07.507 --> 33:09.248
we're taking them
to the Bureau field office.

33:09.291 --> 33:11.859
FBI will establish surveillance
in case Mance shows up.

33:11.902 --> 33:13.861
I hope they have
plenty of agents.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.080
Backup's on the way.

33:15.123 --> 33:17.778
See you there.Yeah.

33:29.355 --> 33:31.748
Well, that's one drug dealer
off the streets.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.104
Jesse!

33:46.067 --> 33:48.330
[grunting]

33:48.374 --> 33:50.637
Jesse! It's Mance.What the hell?

33:50.680 --> 33:52.595
Don't move,
we'll get an ambulance.I'm all right, I'm all right.

33:52.639 --> 33:54.684
Down! Get down!

34:04.825 --> 34:06.392
[tires screeching]

34:10.483 --> 34:12.615
WHISTLER:
Mance's picture is everywhere.

34:12.659 --> 34:15.096
Every agency on alert, but,
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised

34:15.140 --> 34:16.793
if he's already
slipped off the island.

34:16.837 --> 34:19.535
In which case, it might be years
before he surfaces again.

34:24.149 --> 34:26.934
[sighs]:
Ah, man.

34:26.977 --> 34:30.111
Not liking how many of my
agents are getting hurt.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.809
I might have to take a few
weeks off surfing, but I'm fine.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.942
Sure, act all tough now.

34:34.985 --> 34:37.118
But he was whining
like a baby all the way here.

34:37.162 --> 34:40.339
'Cause she hit
every speed bump on the base.

34:41.992 --> 34:44.169
Well, Chris Polis and
Ryan Delucci are cooperating

34:44.212 --> 34:46.388
with our investigation,
so at least we'll be able

34:46.432 --> 34:48.869
to dismantle whatever's left
of Descanso's operation.

34:48.912 --> 34:50.653
But Mance is
still out there.

34:50.697 --> 34:53.178
Got to be something else
we can do.

34:53.221 --> 34:54.962
Maybe one thing.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.748
Guess I'm closing
for good now.

35:00.315 --> 35:03.144
Hey, I'm really sorry
about that, but...

35:03.188 --> 35:07.017
you are gonna be okay, I mean,
you are really, really talented.

35:09.759 --> 35:11.413
Pretty good cook
yourself.

35:11.457 --> 35:13.198
For a cop.[chuckles]

35:14.590 --> 35:16.679
I think I'll enjoy
a smaller place.

35:16.723 --> 35:18.725
Less pressure.

35:18.768 --> 35:21.249
More time to
be creative.

35:21.293 --> 35:23.338
KAI:
I'll be first in line.

35:26.211 --> 35:29.039
You know, I don't hate him.

35:30.432 --> 35:32.391
He came
when you called.

35:32.434 --> 35:34.871
[sighs]He cares.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.137
Thank you.

35:41.574 --> 35:43.358
You want me to come in?

35:45.186 --> 35:47.188
I got this.

35:52.802 --> 35:55.065
[beeping]

36:00.506 --> 36:02.203
[footfalls echo]

36:02.247 --> 36:03.944
Hello?

36:10.429 --> 36:13.083
Dad.

36:13.127 --> 36:15.303
You shouldn't be here.

36:15.347 --> 36:17.479
You don't have to be scared.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.179
I'm not.

36:21.222 --> 36:24.356
I never wanted you to know.

36:25.661 --> 36:27.750
I wanted to be
here for you.

36:27.794 --> 36:30.449
The way I never got
the chance to be.

36:32.407 --> 36:34.235
I'm sorry.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.324
I know.

36:39.545 --> 36:42.548
I'm sorry, too.

36:44.071 --> 36:46.378
Don't!

36:46.421 --> 36:47.988
Not in front of your daughter.

36:48.031 --> 36:50.033
You knew I'd come for her.

36:50.077 --> 36:52.340
I thought
you might.

36:52.384 --> 36:54.995
What father doesn't want to say
goodbye to his little girl?

37:00.435 --> 37:02.481
It was worth it.

37:07.573 --> 37:08.835
[handcuffs clicking]

37:13.579 --> 37:15.015
Hey, Coach.

37:15.058 --> 37:16.538
Hey.

37:16.582 --> 37:18.148
You started
spring training early.

37:18.192 --> 37:20.150
Well, we've got
a shot at state.

37:20.194 --> 37:22.414
But it'll take
a lot of work.

37:24.024 --> 37:26.635
You didn't come
to talk football.

37:26.679 --> 37:28.158
You should be happy for Alex.

37:28.202 --> 37:29.812
Getting recruited is a big deal.

37:29.856 --> 37:31.597
Couldn't be prouder.

37:31.640 --> 37:34.687
I only want what's
best for him.

37:34.730 --> 37:37.211
But... you don't think
Amherst is it?

37:37.255 --> 37:39.561
Most of my players that go
to college on the East Coast,

37:39.605 --> 37:41.737
they don't come home much.

37:41.781 --> 37:44.131
Hawai'i's just too far
to travel.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.438
Yeah.

37:46.481 --> 37:48.309
That would suck.

37:49.745 --> 37:51.921
But I don't think
that's what upset you.

37:55.708 --> 37:57.318
[chuckles]

37:57.362 --> 38:00.060
You were away a lot, Janie.

38:01.061 --> 38:03.150
I didn't have a choice.

38:03.193 --> 38:04.934
I know, and I accepted it.

38:04.978 --> 38:07.285
But those were
hard years.

38:07.328 --> 38:11.593
I was... overwhelmed, alone.

38:11.637 --> 38:13.552
I hated it.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.858
I know.

38:15.902 --> 38:18.992
But you were always
so kind not to say it.

38:19.035 --> 38:22.212
You were thousands of miles
away doing God knows what.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.563
Didn't feel right
putting that on you.

38:26.391 --> 38:29.307
But hearing Alex talk

38:29.350 --> 38:32.440
about... being far away...

38:32.484 --> 38:35.617
thinking about
not seeing him...

38:35.661 --> 38:38.620
[chuckles]
I had, um...

38:38.664 --> 38:40.622
Feelings.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.711
Daniel.

38:42.755 --> 38:45.192
You had feelings.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.328
I'm sorry, okay, that...

38:50.371 --> 38:53.287
you felt that way, but...

38:53.331 --> 38:55.550
that's not Alex.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.685
He is about to do
amazing things.

39:00.990 --> 39:02.514
It's our job
not to get in the way.

39:02.557 --> 39:05.081
I know!

39:05.125 --> 39:07.780
It's gonna be hard
when he goes.

39:10.173 --> 39:12.219
It's gonna be
really hard.

39:14.482 --> 39:16.832
But we'll get
through it together.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.634
[water boiling]

39:40.813 --> 39:42.467
Hey, Pop.

39:43.468 --> 39:44.773
Kai.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.993
Thought you weren't coming.

39:48.255 --> 39:50.344
Yeah, I thought so, too.

39:53.565 --> 39:55.697
Hey.

39:55.741 --> 39:58.613
You were right about one thing.

39:59.788 --> 40:01.703
Just one?

40:02.791 --> 40:05.533
[scoffs softly]

40:05.577 --> 40:08.275
Mom wouldn't want us to fight.

40:09.319 --> 40:11.365
Not just Mom.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.411
Yeah.

40:15.674 --> 40:17.110
[door closes]

40:19.025 --> 40:22.028
Hey, I, um...

40:24.160 --> 40:26.554
I wish I could just forget.

40:28.077 --> 40:30.340
I wish I could put
this anger behind me.

40:30.384 --> 40:32.604
I really do. But I just...

40:32.647 --> 40:35.302
It's important
to remember.

40:37.086 --> 40:39.872
That's what this is.

40:47.836 --> 40:50.186
Hey, you, um,
you remember the...

40:50.230 --> 40:52.188
the last birthday?

40:52.232 --> 40:54.539
Mom was so sick.

40:54.582 --> 40:56.889
She couldn't have
a party and so...

40:56.932 --> 40:59.369
I cooked her all her favorites.

41:01.850 --> 41:03.809
And she just wasn't
up to eating.

41:03.852 --> 41:06.202
So there was, like,
all this food.

41:07.726 --> 41:09.641
I don't remember.

41:09.684 --> 41:12.600
Yeah, you were
at the restaurant.

41:12.644 --> 41:14.689
I was lost, Kai.

41:17.562 --> 41:20.695
I couldn't watch her suffer.

41:22.131 --> 41:24.830
I couldn't
help her.

41:24.873 --> 41:27.485
But you could've
helped me though.

41:35.144 --> 41:36.755
Hey, um...

41:36.798 --> 41:39.584
stew's about to burn.

41:39.627 --> 41:41.629
Yeah. Yeah, you can't have that.

41:41.673 --> 41:43.370
[sniffles]

41:48.810 --> 41:50.333
How about I wrap up

41:50.377 --> 41:52.466
some more lau lau,
yeah?

41:52.510 --> 41:55.251
You're not gonna cheat
and use string, huh?

41:55.295 --> 41:57.558
No, mine stay together
better than yours.

41:57.602 --> 41:59.168
[chuckles]

41:59.212 --> 42:01.606
Ey, who the one
who teach you that, huh?

42:04.565 --> 42:06.132
This is how it's done.

42:06.175 --> 42:08.482
Yeah, here, let me
see, let me see.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.180
Right here.

42:11.224 --> 42:13.748
Ooh.

42:13.792 --> 42:15.489
It's been a while.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.534
I know, I can tell.
