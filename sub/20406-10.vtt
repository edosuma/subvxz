00:09.756 --> 00:10.889
- Fennel, Chef.
- Yes.

Cilantro.

the duck?

00:22.869 --> 00:24.470
Not thinking, Chef.

(Gordon)
No, no, no. No, no, no!

00:27.741 --> 00:29.908
Come here, you.
Get out of my kitchen!

00:29.976 --> 00:32.344
I'm trying my best

00:32.412 --> 00:34.713

Ben... he thinks
he's better than everybody.

I had to get
Ben out of my way.

<i>(Announcer) And some even argued
with Chef Ramsay.</i>

You can't grill asparagus.

00:49.996 --> 00:51.296

Fran.

Both of you, take off
your [bleep] jackets.

01:27.367 --> 01:29.835

Welcome back.

03:13.473 --> 03:15.140
It was just so overwhelming

03:15.208 --> 03:17.609
to know that I
still have another chance.

03:17.677 --> 03:19.878

Autumn with the team again...

03:21.581 --> 03:23.215

03:25.585 --> 03:27.953
I'm glad that Frances

03:28.021 --> 03:30.489
I'm excited to work
with you three.

03:30.557 --> 03:31.890
It's gonna be good.
Yeah.

03:31.958 --> 03:33.158
It was definitely
a step up for us

03:33.226 --> 03:34.793
going from Fran to Autumn.

03:34.861 --> 03:36.295
And, uh, hopefully
we can win.

03:55.114 --> 03:56.982
<i>Chef Ramsay

03:57.050 --> 03:58.817
Good morning.
Early bird catches the worm.

03:58.885 --> 04:01.119
Wakey-wakey.

04:01.187 --> 04:02.487
All right,
listen to me.

04:02.555 --> 04:04.389
As the head chef
at the Savoy Grill in London,

04:04.457 --> 04:05.424
you'll be working with
some of the most sought after,

04:05.491 --> 04:06.658
some of the most expensive,

04:06.726 --> 04:09.361
and some of the rarest
ingredients ever.

04:09.429 --> 04:11.230
For today's challenge,

04:11.297 --> 04:16.168
you're gonna be creative
with...

04:16.236 --> 04:19.238
these babies here.

04:19.305 --> 04:20.172
(Jason) Wow.
- Yes.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.207
Absolutely phenomenal.

04:22.275 --> 04:23.709
Ten-pound lobsters.

04:23.776 --> 04:25.277
(Jay)
For a ten-pound lobster,

04:25.345 --> 04:26.612
you pretty much need
to either scuba dive

04:26.679 --> 04:27.879
and get it yourself,

04:27.947 --> 04:29.748
or you need to run down
to your local aquarium.

04:29.816 --> 04:31.516
Jason, come over here.

04:31.584 --> 04:33.418
I want to introduce you

04:33.486 --> 04:35.587
to Salvatore, yes?

04:35.655 --> 04:39.024
Be very careful.
Ten-pound baby.

04:39.092 --> 04:40.959
I took very good care
of Salvatore.

04:41.027 --> 04:42.928
I love you.

04:42.996 --> 04:44.096
Nilka.

04:44.163 --> 04:45.130
Let me introduce you

04:45.198 --> 04:47.099
to your friend Siobhan.

04:47.166 --> 04:48.200
[chuckles]
(Gordon) Yes.

04:48.268 --> 04:49.668
- Hello, Siobhan.
- No... there you go.

04:49.736 --> 04:51.303
Give it a little kiss.

04:51.371 --> 04:52.738
Mwah.
[chuckles]

04:52.805 --> 04:54.273
I've worked with some
big-ass lobsters in my life,

04:54.340 --> 04:56.041
but that was the biggest.

04:56.109 --> 04:57.609
I'm excited.
I know how to cook lobster!

04:57.677 --> 04:59.745
So for your next challenge,
I want each and every one of you

04:59.812 --> 05:02.514
to come up with
an exciting, creative

05:02.582 --> 05:03.915
dish with lobster.

05:03.983 --> 05:06.618
I want something that is
gonna blow my mind away.

05:06.686 --> 05:08.920
(All)
Yes, Chef.

05:08.988 --> 05:09.988
You've all got fourty-five minutes

05:10.056 --> 05:12.190
starting from now.

05:12.258 --> 05:13.158
<i>(Announcer)
With this challenge, Chef Ramsay</i>

05:13.226 --> 05:14.526

05:14.594 --> 05:16.495
<i>creativity and execution.</i>

05:16.562 --> 05:18.563

a ten-pound lobster</i>

05:18.631 --> 05:19.931
<i>among its members</i>

<i>so each can create
an impressive lobster dish.</i>

05:22.769 --> 05:24.002
So y'all want to talk?

05:24.070 --> 05:25.637
I just want the knuckles.

05:25.705 --> 05:27.105
I'm gonna use
that tail and that claw.

05:27.173 --> 05:29.174
(Jason) Well, you gonna have
to fight for that tail.

05:29.242 --> 05:31.009
And I want the whole shell
for the display.

05:31.077 --> 05:32.411
I want... I want
to use the meat.

05:32.478 --> 05:34.379
Good.
Save me that tail.

05:34.447 --> 05:35.447
(Jason) I'm gonna tell you
a little secret.

05:35.515 --> 05:36.815
See, the secret is,

05:36.883 --> 05:38.950
Ed and Jay,
in their minds,

05:39.018 --> 05:40.619
I'm one of
the weaker people.

05:40.687 --> 05:43.188
And now it's just time
for me to emerge.

05:43.256 --> 05:45.090
Want to poach it real quick
just to kill it and set it?

05:45.158 --> 05:46.458
Yeah, that's fine.

05:46.526 --> 05:48.026
(Ed)
Poach it.

05:48.094 --> 05:50.028
Can I use tail?

05:50.096 --> 05:51.463
(Holli)
Can I use the claw?

05:51.531 --> 05:52.731
I wanted a piece
of the tail.

05:52.799 --> 05:53.965
No, I...
I'll take the tail.

05:54.033 --> 05:55.000
So I guess
I got the bo...

05:55.068 --> 05:56.201
the body is [bleep].

05:56.269 --> 05:57.636
But there's a huge tail.

05:57.704 --> 05:58.837
I don't need the whole tail,
I just...

05:58.905 --> 06:00.372
- Yeah, he's...
- The bottom... yeah.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.040
<i>(Announcer)

<i>in the blue kitchen,
Ed lights a fire under his.</i>

06:06.346 --> 06:08.246
(Jay) I saw Ed grilling
the lobster tail,

06:08.314 --> 06:09.748
which scared me a little bit

06:09.816 --> 06:10.782
because lobster tail
is already a little tough.

06:10.850 --> 06:13.085
How's that lobster?

06:13.152 --> 06:16.154
To poach it and grill it... I was
a little concerned about that.

06:16.222 --> 06:17.589
How does that feel
to you?

06:17.657 --> 06:18.990
- I just don't want it too rubbery.
- It feel good.

06:19.058 --> 06:21.059
Good lord baby Jesus,
that's going to be good.

06:21.127 --> 06:22.627
What's that?

06:22.695 --> 06:24.229
I said mine's gonna be so good.
I'm so happy.

06:24.297 --> 06:26.365
(Ed) Jay thinks he knows more
than everybody else.

06:26.432 --> 06:27.566
I don't let that bother me.

06:27.633 --> 06:28.900
No, if I let that
bother me,

06:28.968 --> 06:30.369
that's when I fall apart.

06:30.436 --> 06:32.237

07:03.970 --> 07:05.504
Ben just [bleep] me over.

07:05.571 --> 07:06.538
(Nilka)
There's no more meat, right?

07:06.606 --> 07:08.140
No.

07:08.207 --> 07:09.975
Last two minutes, guys.

07:10.042 --> 07:11.376
(Gordon)
Make it count, Nilka.

07:11.444 --> 07:12.677
(Nilka)
Yes, Chef.

07:12.745 --> 07:14.946
(Gordon)
Start getting your plates out.

07:15.014 --> 07:16.581
(Ed) Jay, let me know
when you're plating.

07:16.649 --> 07:19.518
(Gordon)
Last minute.

07:19.585 --> 07:21.987
Good, Ed.

07:22.054 --> 07:23.655
I'm going up.

07:23.723 --> 07:25.123
(Gordon)
Five... Four...

07:25.191 --> 07:27.893
Three... Two... One.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.795
And serve, guys.

07:31.297 --> 07:33.498
Right. Clearly
four against three,

07:33.566 --> 07:34.566
Thirty seconds.

07:34.634 --> 07:36.501
Decide who has
the weakest dish.

07:36.569 --> 07:39.104
Hurry up.
Get a fork. Taste.

07:39.172 --> 07:42.340
Well, at least you had the sense
and intelligence to taste.

07:42.408 --> 07:44.009
- That's one.
- Yes.

07:44.076 --> 07:45.377
(Gordon) Thank God.
Ten seconds left.

07:45.445 --> 07:46.912
That's good.

07:46.979 --> 07:48.079
I think it's
a little too truffly.

07:48.147 --> 07:49.614
I don't know
if I like that one.

07:49.682 --> 07:51.149
- I'm sorry.
- That's fine.

07:51.217 --> 07:53.552
Okay, whose dish
do you like the least?

07:53.619 --> 07:55.720
Mine.

07:55.788 --> 07:58.156
I'm not happy.

07:58.224 --> 08:00.225
(Nilka) I'm just really
disappointed right now.

08:00.293 --> 08:01.393
I want another opportunity

08:01.461 --> 08:03.161
to show myself and...
and let him see

08:03.229 --> 08:04.329
that I'm not a [bleep]-up.

08:04.397 --> 08:05.831
What was the dish?

08:05.898 --> 08:07.799
I made a potato puree

08:07.867 --> 08:08.900
and I put
some lobster on it.

08:08.968 --> 08:10.902
Sounds disgusting.

08:10.970 --> 08:13.004
(Gordon)
Good choice.

08:13.072 --> 08:15.373
Right. Today I'm going to be
doing something different.

08:15.441 --> 08:17.108
I won't be judging
these dishes alone.

08:17.176 --> 08:20.278
I've invited
three highly respected,

08:20.346 --> 08:21.880
world-class chefs.

08:21.948 --> 08:24.649
First,
I'm honored to have

08:24.717 --> 08:26.885
a two Michelin-starred chef,

08:26.953 --> 08:29.921
Josiah Citrin from
the amazing Melisse.

08:29.989 --> 08:30.989
Thank you so much
for joining us.

08:31.057 --> 08:32.890
- Pleasure to be here.
- Good to see you.

08:32.958 --> 08:34.359
(Benjamin)
It's definitely an honor.

08:34.427 --> 08:35.894
There's nobody else
I'd rather cook for.

08:35.962 --> 08:37.328
You know, I want to have
Michelin stars.

08:37.395 --> 08:38.929
And that gets me all,
like, tingly inside,

08:38.998 --> 08:40.164
just seeing, you know,

08:40.232 --> 08:41.666
an American chef
with Michelin stars

08:41.734 --> 08:43.001
because that's
what I dreamt about

08:43.068 --> 08:45.003
when I was like eighteen,
nineteen years old.

08:45.071 --> 08:49.074
Next, another
two Michelin star chef,

08:49.141 --> 08:50.642
Michael Cimarusti...

08:50.710 --> 08:52.477
- Oh, my God.
- From Providence Restaurant.

08:52.545 --> 08:53.979
Michael, good
to see you, sir.

08:54.046 --> 08:55.547
- Good to see you, too.
- Thank you so much for coming.

08:55.615 --> 08:57.115
Thank you for having me.

08:57.183 --> 08:58.917
And for our third and
final judge, David Lefevre,

08:58.985 --> 09:01.419
of the Michelin-starred
restaurant Water Grill.

09:01.487 --> 09:02.888
Good to see you, sir.

09:02.955 --> 09:04.656
- How you doing, Chef?
- Thank you so much for coming.

09:04.724 --> 09:06.491
(Jay)
It's scary to cook

09:06.559 --> 09:07.592
for Michelin-starred chefs.

09:07.660 --> 09:10.262
I was actually
really, really excited.

09:10.329 --> 09:11.863
Right, first round.

09:11.931 --> 09:14.633
Holli versus Ed's.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.101
<i>(Announcer)
David Lefevre of the Water Grill</i>

09:16.168 --> 09:19.037
<i>will be judging
the first round.</i>

09:19.105 --> 09:20.739
Holli, explain to David
what it is, please.

09:20.806 --> 09:23.208
I have a butter-poached
lobster.

09:23.276 --> 09:24.843
I have a gingered
lobster sauce

09:24.911 --> 09:25.911
mounted with a little
bit of butter,

09:25.978 --> 09:28.380
and a fresh fennel salad
top.

09:28.447 --> 09:29.481
(Gordon)
Okay.

09:29.549 --> 09:30.882
(Holli)
Oh, God.

09:30.950 --> 09:33.285
How is my dish gonna go
in front of these amazing chefs?

09:33.352 --> 09:34.653
I started shaking
at that point.

09:34.720 --> 09:35.587
How was that?

09:37.957 --> 09:38.990
It's good.
It was good.

09:39.058 --> 09:40.425
You get the ginger.

09:40.493 --> 09:41.660
You get the flavors
that you're talking about,

09:41.727 --> 09:43.728
and, yeah,
and the vegetable.

09:43.796 --> 09:45.697
Uh, right. Ed, explain to
David, please, your dish.

09:45.765 --> 09:49.534
We have a poached and then
grilled lobster tail medallions.

09:49.602 --> 09:51.570
Underneath is a mango
and ginger puree.

09:51.637 --> 09:53.572
It's a little chewy.

09:53.639 --> 09:55.273
Absolutely right.
Slightly rubbery.

09:55.341 --> 09:56.875
How does that feel to you?

09:56.943 --> 09:58.143
I just don't want it
too rubbery.

09:58.210 --> 09:59.911
It feel good.

09:59.979 --> 10:01.713
(David) The seasoning
on the vegetables is very good,

10:01.781 --> 10:02.881
but the lobster, I think,
is overcooked.

10:02.949 --> 10:04.082
Okay.

10:04.150 --> 10:06.418
Tough decision, and two
creative dishes.

10:06.485 --> 10:07.586
- Mm-hmm.
- If you were to choose,

10:07.653 --> 10:09.020
would you go
for the red team

10:09.088 --> 10:10.055
or would you go for
the blue team, please, David?

10:10.122 --> 10:11.423
I think in terms
of creativity,

10:11.490 --> 10:12.824
this one's a little bit
more creative.

10:12.892 --> 10:13.825
But I think, in terms
of execution,

10:13.893 --> 10:15.527
I would choose this one.

10:15.595 --> 10:16.928
(Gordon) Well done.
Holli, congratulations.

10:16.996 --> 10:18.430
- Thank you, Chef.
- That's one meal for the red.

10:18.497 --> 10:20.231
(Nilka)
I think that Holli's

10:20.299 --> 10:21.633
been flying under the radar.

10:21.701 --> 10:23.435
I think she has great potential
to be really strong

10:23.502 --> 10:26.605
in this competition.

10:26.672 --> 10:29.574
Okay, for the second round,
uh, Michael Cimarusti, please.

10:29.642 --> 10:31.943
<i>(Announcer)
Up next, two Michelin star chef</i>

10:32.011 --> 10:33.979
<i>Michael Cimarusti
prepares to taste</i>

10:34.046 --> 10:36.848
<i>Autumn and Jason's
lobster creations.</i>

10:36.916 --> 10:38.183
[chuckles]

10:38.250 --> 10:40.185
- Wow, look at that.
- Yeah, that's huge.

10:40.252 --> 10:41.620
[bleep]! That was a big
lobster, though.

10:41.687 --> 10:43.922
We'll use that as a bathtub
after dinner.

10:43.990 --> 10:46.291
I've never in my
thirteen years of cooking

10:46.359 --> 10:47.859
seen anything like that.

10:47.927 --> 10:49.127
It was like a salad bar

10:49.195 --> 10:50.895
with a meatloaf on top.

10:50.963 --> 10:52.297
That would not be
a single person...

10:52.365 --> 10:54.265
family style or appetizer,
people could dip in.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.601
I'm 6'4".
I'm a real big guy.

10:56.669 --> 10:58.269
And when I get hungry,

10:58.337 --> 11:00.372
I just want to eat.

11:00.439 --> 11:02.040
Explain to Michael
what it is, please.

11:02.108 --> 11:03.575
Yes, Chef.

11:03.643 --> 11:05.377
Uh, up underneath,
inside the lobster tail,

11:05.444 --> 11:07.178
we went with
a saffron polenta.

11:07.246 --> 11:08.980
We took some
of the water spinach,

11:09.048 --> 11:10.715
uh, rainbow carrots,
and asparagus.

11:10.783 --> 11:11.850
Michael,
what'd you think?

11:11.917 --> 11:13.184
You know,

11:13.252 --> 11:14.019
there are fairly
good flavors going on here.

11:14.086 --> 11:15.320
I mean, surprisingly,

11:15.388 --> 11:16.321
the lobster's actually
not too bad.

11:16.389 --> 11:17.989
Eh...

11:18.057 --> 11:19.824
Good points.
Very good points.

11:19.892 --> 11:21.292
Autumn, explain
to Michael,

11:21.360 --> 11:22.761
please, what it is.
Thank you.

11:22.828 --> 11:25.563
This is a lobster stir fry.

11:25.631 --> 11:27.499
And there's also
a little cilantro,

11:27.566 --> 11:29.000
basil, chervil.

11:29.068 --> 11:30.468
The one thing
that I would look for

11:30.536 --> 11:31.569
in this dish would be
a higher level of refinement.

11:31.637 --> 11:33.204
You know?
It's all, like...

11:33.272 --> 11:34.205
you're sort of clobbering
the lobster

11:34.273 --> 11:35.306
with all these huge flavors.

11:35.374 --> 11:36.741
Michael,

11:36.809 --> 11:38.376
if you were coming
for dinner this evening

11:38.444 --> 11:40.512
in Hell's Kitchen,
would you order

11:40.579 --> 11:42.347
the lobster
from the blue team

11:42.415 --> 11:44.449
or the red team?
I would... I would order...

11:44.517 --> 11:46.551
I think I'd order the dish
from the blue team from Jason.

11:46.619 --> 11:48.286
You know, I could feed
my family of four with that.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.921
Yep. Right.

11:49.989 --> 11:53.458
Okay, 1-1.

11:55.161 --> 11:56.928
Okay, third round.

11:56.996 --> 11:58.930
Josiah Citrin,
please come over, buddy.

11:58.998 --> 12:00.165
<i>(Announcer)

12:00.232 --> 12:01.599
<i>Jay and his former
teammate</i>

12:01.667 --> 12:02.801
<i>and current rival Benjamin</i>

12:02.868 --> 12:04.569

12:04.637 --> 12:05.870

12:05.938 --> 12:08.606
Okay, dishes please.

12:08.674 --> 12:10.141
Right. Benjamin, explain
exactly what it is, please.

12:10.209 --> 12:11.776
We poached it and then
finished off the lobster tail

12:11.844 --> 12:13.211
in butter.

12:13.279 --> 12:16.014
Did a parsnip purée with
a sherry vinaigrette, Chef.

12:16.082 --> 12:18.950
Well, I think the presentation
of the dish is sloppy.

12:19.018 --> 12:20.218
So I would like to see
a little more, you know,

12:20.286 --> 12:21.252
finesse to the dish.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.887
Yes, Chef.

12:22.955 --> 12:24.289
(Benjamin) I was rushing
right from the beginning.

12:24.356 --> 12:25.824
My dish looked like slop.
But, um...

12:25.891 --> 12:27.559
I thought Jay's dish
looked immaculate.

12:27.626 --> 12:30.028
You know.
I was like, "oh, [bleep]."

12:30.096 --> 12:31.329
Jay, please, uh,
explain it to Josiah.

12:31.397 --> 12:33.031
This is a lobster knuckle

12:33.099 --> 12:34.399
and black truffle
cappuccino.

12:34.467 --> 12:36.501
I made a little canapé
of just some poached lobster

12:36.569 --> 12:38.970
with a brioche and then a little
bit of caviar creme fraiche.

12:39.038 --> 12:40.338
So when you eat
the cappuccino,

12:40.406 --> 12:41.306
if you would, just please
eat from the bottom up.

12:41.373 --> 12:43.508
[exhales]

12:43.576 --> 12:45.877
Um, I don't think you need
to tell Chef how to eat.

12:45.945 --> 12:47.145
- Trust me.
- Yes, Chef.

12:48.614 --> 12:50.115
These ingredients...
I mean,

12:50.182 --> 12:51.916
the combination's
classical.

12:51.984 --> 12:53.384
It gives justice
to the lobster,

12:53.452 --> 12:55.754
but unfortunately, underneath,
the lobster's raw.

12:55.821 --> 12:56.688
(Gordon)
Red team or blue team, please.

12:56.756 --> 12:58.556
That's a tough decision.

12:58.624 --> 13:01.426
Um...

13:07.257 --> 13:08.690
<i>(Announcer)

13:09.729 --> 13:11.663
<i>And now, two Michelin star

13:11.731 --> 13:15.567
<i>must pick either
Benjamin or Jay's dish.</i>

13:17.103 --> 13:18.169
Neither one
I would want to eat,

13:18.237 --> 13:19.871

13:19.939 --> 13:21.206
No winner.
Back in line.

13:21.274 --> 13:22.908
(Holli)
The fact that

13:22.975 --> 13:24.209
neither of 'em got a point

13:24.277 --> 13:26.211
is shocking to me.

13:26.279 --> 13:27.412
I thought they
would have killed it.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.813
You know,
both of 'em.

13:28.881 --> 13:31.216
'Cause they're both, like,
really great chefs.

13:31.284 --> 13:32.984
<i>(Announcer)

13:33.052 --> 13:35.287
<i>it's up to Chef Ramsay

13:35.354 --> 13:38.290
In order
to break the tie,

13:38.357 --> 13:39.457
I'm going to award
the point to the person

13:39.525 --> 13:42.827
with the best dish overall.

13:42.895 --> 13:46.798
I'm gonna give that to...

13:46.866 --> 13:49.167
Holli.

13:51.804 --> 13:52.837
Yes. You've won it
for the red team.

13:52.905 --> 13:54.339
[exclaims]
Thank you.

13:54.407 --> 13:55.774
- Thank you, Holli.
- You're welcome.

13:55.841 --> 13:57.776
Your dish was the best
by far.

13:57.843 --> 13:59.844
Red team finally won,

13:59.912 --> 14:02.047
and I'm proud to say that I
kicked ass on this dish.

14:02.114 --> 14:03.214
I really did.

14:03.282 --> 14:05.317
Gentlemen, as always.

14:05.384 --> 14:07.018
Come back and see us.
Good to see you. Yes.

14:07.086 --> 14:08.386
- Bye.
(Holli) Thank you.

14:08.454 --> 14:09.921
(Ed)
Thank you, Chef.

14:09.989 --> 14:11.590
Okay, red team,

14:11.657 --> 14:12.791
you're going to be
experiencing the life

14:12.858 --> 14:13.858
of the rich and famous.

14:13.926 --> 14:15.126
First up,

14:15.194 --> 14:18.697
you're off to the amazing

14:18.764 --> 14:20.398
Petrossian Caviar House.

14:20.466 --> 14:22.567
They are the famous

14:22.635 --> 14:24.069
purveyors
of the finest caviar

14:24.136 --> 14:25.236
across the world.

14:25.304 --> 14:27.305
Ohh.

14:27.373 --> 14:28.473
After that,

14:28.541 --> 14:30.875
you'll be shopping

14:30.943 --> 14:32.644
like the rich and famous.

14:32.712 --> 14:34.412
Yes, so I'm going
to give you $1,000

14:34.480 --> 14:36.047
and just, you know...

14:36.115 --> 14:37.682
hey, just... just...

14:37.750 --> 14:39.417
just blow it.
[cheers]

14:39.485 --> 14:41.052
(Holli)
Thank you.

14:42.230 --> 14:43.530
(Jason)
I was sick

14:43.598 --> 14:44.531
when he announced
the $1,000.

14:44.599 --> 14:46.300
I love to shop.

14:46.367 --> 14:47.701
Anyone who knows me...

14:47.769 --> 14:49.703
my wife don't even like
shopping with me,

14:49.771 --> 14:50.971
'cause it's a problem.

14:51.039 --> 14:52.840
Okay, off you go...
go get ready,

14:52.907 --> 14:54.541
because we're opening
for dinner tonight.

14:54.609 --> 14:56.276
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

14:56.344 --> 14:57.511
Holy mackerel.

14:57.579 --> 14:59.246
[exclaims and laughs]

14:59.314 --> 15:00.714
(Nilka)
You lucky bitch, you!

15:00.782 --> 15:02.816
(Autumn) I just keep
switching and winning.

15:02.884 --> 15:05.352
I don't think there's
a person in Hell's Kitchen

15:05.420 --> 15:06.987
that's had better luck
with switching teams.

15:07.055 --> 15:08.455
I think
I'm a good luck charm.

15:08.523 --> 15:10.424
$1,000 to go shopping.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.826
I just about
lost my mind.

15:12.894 --> 15:14.394
[squeals]

15:14.462 --> 15:16.130
(Benjamin)
Good job, Holli.

15:16.197 --> 15:17.030
(Gordon)
Okay.

15:17.098 --> 15:19.199
For the punishment,

15:19.267 --> 15:22.369
I want the dorms cleaned
from top to bottom.

15:22.437 --> 15:23.670
Bathrooms,
showers, drawers...

15:23.738 --> 15:25.472
you will then come down
and prep both kitchens

15:25.540 --> 15:26.540
for dinner tonight.

15:26.608 --> 15:28.075
Get the [bleep] upstairs.

15:28.143 --> 15:30.010
(Jay)
Unbelievable.

15:30.078 --> 15:31.845
I thought I would definitely
have gotten the point.

15:31.913 --> 15:33.180
And I am at a loss
for words right now.

15:33.248 --> 15:35.516
Why?

15:35.583 --> 15:37.651
My presentation was nicer.

15:37.719 --> 15:39.052
It was more creative.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.387
Whether it was... is creative
on their standards,

15:40.455 --> 15:42.422
it was the most creative
dish here, sorry.

15:42.490 --> 15:45.192
(Ed) Jay thinks he knows
a little too much,

15:45.260 --> 15:46.860
and knowing a little too much

15:46.928 --> 15:48.495
might not be
the, uh, best thing.

15:48.563 --> 15:49.797
It was cooked right.

15:49.864 --> 15:51.064
Like, [bleep],
how can you not...

15:51.132 --> 15:52.666
How do you have raw lobster
in hot soup?

15:52.734 --> 15:53.967
It's not possible.

15:54.035 --> 15:56.503
Well, Jay,
you always tell me

15:56.571 --> 15:58.305
that they're right...
That's what you tell me.

15:58.373 --> 15:59.773
I don't mind losing
when I deserve to lose.

15:59.841 --> 16:02.176
That I did not
deserve to lose.

16:02.243 --> 16:05.078
This is so not fun.

16:05.146 --> 16:07.214
(Autumn)
Caviar... Shopping...

16:07.282 --> 16:09.183
Shopping.

16:09.250 --> 16:10.384
(Holli) I'm thrilled
beyond belief right now.

16:10.451 --> 16:11.885
It's an experience
of a lifetime.

16:11.953 --> 16:13.954
I like winning.

16:14.022 --> 16:15.455
We won!

16:15.523 --> 16:16.757
[screaming and cheering]

16:16.825 --> 16:17.791
Yeah!

16:17.859 --> 16:20.093
Freaking incredible.

16:20.161 --> 16:22.629
Hello, America!
I'm out of the kitchen!

16:22.697 --> 16:25.666
[laughter]

16:25.733 --> 16:28.769
This is lovely!

16:28.837 --> 16:30.571
Got a little something
for you.

16:30.638 --> 16:32.306
- Yes, Chef.
- Get dressed.

16:32.373 --> 16:34.808
Um, be careful.

16:34.876 --> 16:36.643
Our punishment today
is cleaning up the dorms

16:36.711 --> 16:38.779
and prepping both kitchens.

16:38.847 --> 16:40.047
[laughs]

16:40.114 --> 16:42.115
Take our coats off,
obviously.

16:42.183 --> 16:44.117
The worst part of losing
is this look.

16:44.185 --> 16:45.886
(Jason)
Jay, honey.

16:45.954 --> 16:47.421
[laughing]

16:47.488 --> 16:49.723
[bleep] love this [bleep].

16:49.791 --> 16:51.358
(Ed) You never want to lose
a challenge,

16:51.426 --> 16:53.493
and this is why you don't
want to lose a challenge.

16:58.766 --> 17:00.133
Scrub it out.

17:00.201 --> 17:01.468
Cleaning toilets...
pretty nasty,

17:01.536 --> 17:02.853
if you think about it.

17:04.472 --> 17:06.640
Hell's Kitchen
chef maid service.

17:06.708 --> 17:09.476
[sighs]
It sucks.

17:13.848 --> 17:17.818
- Hi.
- Hello.

17:17.886 --> 17:20.253
Let me introduce you
to Alexandre Petrossian.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.289
- Hi, I'm Holli.
- Yes.

17:22.357 --> 17:23.991
(Holli) The first thing I thought
is, "Oh, my God."

17:24.058 --> 17:25.659
Alexandre Petrossian
is adorable.

17:25.727 --> 17:26.960
You should take
a sip of the champagne

17:27.028 --> 17:28.494
to clean your palate.

17:28.563 --> 17:31.164
Absolutely adorable.

17:31.232 --> 17:32.733
[laughs]

17:32.800 --> 17:33.967
We should start by...
this one.

17:34.035 --> 17:36.069
It's the Rolls Royce
of the caviar.

17:36.137 --> 17:37.738
Has the, uh, herring
in caviar.

17:37.805 --> 17:39.306
It's the most expensive...

17:39.374 --> 17:40.440
Perfect aphrodisiac.

17:40.508 --> 17:43.277
[laughter]

17:43.344 --> 17:46.146
This one will be
about, uh, $500.

17:46.214 --> 17:48.949
- Oh, my God.
- I'll... I'll take it.

17:49.017 --> 17:51.151
(Holli)
I don't know

17:51.219 --> 17:53.053
if caviar
is an aphrodisiac,

17:53.121 --> 17:55.088
but I've been locked
in a dorm

17:55.156 --> 17:56.723
for I don't even know
how long

17:56.791 --> 18:00.260
so I don't think
I need an aphrodisiac.

18:00.328 --> 18:02.062
I'm ready to go crazy
right now.

18:02.130 --> 18:03.063
[laughs]

18:03.131 --> 18:05.599
This is just fresh.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.401
(Autumn) There's so many
layers of flavoring.

18:07.468 --> 18:08.568
It's one of my favorite foods.

18:08.636 --> 18:11.104
Caviar is like fine wine.

18:11.172 --> 18:12.906
(Gordon)
Autumn, small sips.

18:12.974 --> 18:15.842
You don't have
to drink it all.

18:15.910 --> 18:17.945
(Nilka) I'm a virgin,
really, to caviar.

18:18.012 --> 18:21.048
I had never tasted caviar,
and it tastes fabulous.

18:21.115 --> 18:23.050
I never thought
in a million years

18:23.117 --> 18:24.952
I would be experiencing
caviar like that,

18:25.019 --> 18:26.520
just sipping champagne.

18:26.587 --> 18:27.654
It was beautiful.

18:27.722 --> 18:29.056
This is very good.

18:29.123 --> 18:30.457
In the real world,
there'll be some cheeseburgers

18:30.525 --> 18:31.725
and fries for me.

18:31.793 --> 18:33.660
A poor's woman's meal.
[laughs]

18:33.728 --> 18:34.828
The thing is
this is like a new world for me

18:34.896 --> 18:36.730
and it's amazing.

18:39.334 --> 18:40.968
This is it.

18:41.035 --> 18:42.369
This whole area's done.

18:42.437 --> 18:43.570
I just put everything
back together.

18:43.638 --> 18:45.005
Bathroom looks good.

18:45.073 --> 18:46.306
As soon as we finish
cleaning the dorms,

18:46.374 --> 18:47.441
we have to, you know,
go right downstairs

18:47.508 --> 18:49.776
and prep both kitchens.

18:49.844 --> 18:51.144
I'm scared
'cause we're behind.

18:51.212 --> 18:52.980
This is, by far,
the worst punishment.

18:53.047 --> 18:55.082
This kitchen needs to be
completely set up

18:55.149 --> 18:56.650
for dinner service
before you can actually

18:56.718 --> 18:59.519
go into your kitchen
and start setting it up.

18:59.587 --> 19:01.021
(Ed) Three people. Explain to me
how we're gonna prep.

19:06.260 --> 19:08.061
[laughing]
There you go!

19:08.129 --> 19:10.797
It's like, literally,
a shopping playground.

19:10.865 --> 19:12.332
There's everything
you could want.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.900
Love the world.
Love it.

19:13.968 --> 19:15.469
[laughter]

19:15.536 --> 19:18.105
(Salesman)
Whoo!

19:18.172 --> 19:20.140
Beyonce ain't got
nothin' on you.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.441
That [bleep] was priceless.

19:21.509 --> 19:22.809
This is nice.

19:22.877 --> 19:25.545
I had a blast, and I
thank God that I'm here.

19:25.613 --> 19:27.114
Like, just pearls.

19:27.181 --> 19:28.482
It'd be nice to bring
something home for my wife.

19:28.549 --> 19:30.917
If I find a man
half as good as you...

19:30.985 --> 19:32.319
I'll be all right.

19:32.387 --> 19:33.787
It's a pleasure to spend
Chef Ramsay's money.

19:33.855 --> 19:35.555
- Thank you.
- That was fun.

19:35.623 --> 19:38.325
- That was.
- It was fun.

19:38.393 --> 19:39.760
(Jay) Can't go next door
till everything's done.

19:39.827 --> 19:41.695
The pasta's gotta sit
for at least another half hour.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.398
It's getting to be
beyond service.

19:44.465 --> 19:45.665
(Jay)
Guess who's back.

19:45.733 --> 19:47.801
(Jason)
Oh, wow.

19:47.869 --> 19:48.902
Look at that.

19:51.506 --> 19:53.140
(Holli)
Hey, Jay.

19:53.207 --> 19:54.508
Want some caviar?

19:57.512 --> 19:59.246
(Jay)
Boy, oh, boy.

19:59.313 --> 20:01.515
Holli could easily
talk my pants right off.

20:01.582 --> 20:02.616
No alcohol needed.

20:02.683 --> 20:04.484
Without a doubt.

20:04.552 --> 20:06.686
<i>(Announcer) With dinner service

(Holli)
Do you guys have anything

20:15.963 --> 20:17.030
prepped on your side yet?

20:17.098 --> 20:18.098
Nothing.

20:18.166 --> 20:20.367
- Nothing at all?
- Nothing at all.

20:20.435 --> 20:21.568
We haven't even
walked over there.

20:21.636 --> 20:23.236
Oh, we're gonna be
so screwed.

20:23.304 --> 20:25.572
Man, there's
so much [bleep].

20:25.640 --> 20:27.240
I don't even know
where to get started at.

20:27.308 --> 20:28.308
- Nothing's cooked?
(Jason) I don't think so.

20:28.376 --> 20:29.476
(Ed)
I'm a little bit worried

20:29.544 --> 20:30.710
about not having
everything prepped up.

20:30.778 --> 20:32.479
Fifteen minutes left
before we open the doors,

20:32.547 --> 20:34.214
and we're still
running around, prepping things.

20:34.282 --> 20:35.849
We've got nothing.
No prep whatsoever.

20:35.917 --> 20:38.485
So it's gonna be nuts.

20:38.553 --> 20:39.586
(Gordon)
Let's go, ladies.

20:41.022 --> 20:42.022
Right, guys.
Let's go.

20:44.459 --> 20:45.909
Line up, guys.

20:47.428 --> 20:48.728
Okay.

20:48.796 --> 20:50.230
The last two services

20:50.298 --> 20:52.999
have been
a big disappointment.

20:53.067 --> 20:54.067
I certainly hope
you're all ready.

20:54.135 --> 20:57.737
Here's the bad news.

<i>(Announcer)

21:15.808 --> 21:16.674
Right, guys.
Let's go.

21:16.742 --> 21:17.675
Yes, Chef.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.911
The last two services

21:19.979 --> 21:22.714
have been a big
disappointment.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.549
I certainly hope
you're all ready.

21:24.617 --> 21:28.553
Here's the bad news.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.723
We're moving into
the red kitchen,

21:31.790 --> 21:33.925
and we're all gonna
cook together.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.693
Thank the baby Jesus,
because

21:35.761 --> 21:38.696
three people
in an unprepped kitchen

21:38.764 --> 21:41.633
would have been detrimental
to my well-being.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.235
It's gonna really
help me ascertain

21:44.303 --> 21:45.670
who's gonna start emerging.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.772
We haven't worked together
as one kitchen.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.940
You know,
the pressure is on.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.541
We need to be better
than good.

21:50.609 --> 21:52.677
The customers
in the restaurant tonight

21:52.745 --> 21:55.146
are all going
to the theater after dinner.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.582
We need to complete service

21:57.650 --> 21:59.250
in two hours, thirty minutes.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.351
(All) Yes, Chef.
- Yeah?

22:00.419 --> 22:01.986
To cut us
a little bit more time,

22:02.054 --> 22:04.689
we're gonna be serving
caviar tableside.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.824
Then we'll go
straight to the appetizers.

22:06.892 --> 22:09.093
Holli, your dish
was the best,

22:09.161 --> 22:10.228
so you're serving tableside.

22:10.295 --> 22:11.496
Yes, Chef.

22:11.563 --> 22:13.731
Now, they have got
to make the theater.

22:13.799 --> 22:14.999
Yes?

22:15.067 --> 22:16.367
(All)
Yes, Chef.

22:16.435 --> 22:17.902
Let's go, guys.
On your section.

Thank you.

You ready, Nilka?

24:07.546 --> 24:08.646
I'm getting it
together now.

24:08.714 --> 24:10.114

Thirty seconds.

24:13.552 --> 24:15.153
Yes, Chef.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.554
- Don't you start doing that to me.
- Yes, Chef.

24:16.622 --> 24:17.388
She's not ready,
that's her fault.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.157
But don't hold back.

Excuse me.

- Keep it going, yeah?
- Yes, Chef. Yes, Chef.

24:49.688 --> 24:51.789
[bleep] beef

24:51.857 --> 24:53.858
Finally
he's [bleep] woken up.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.493
I've got John Dory.
Where's the turbot?

24:55.561 --> 24:59.430
Turbot's right here, Chef.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.432
Oh, [bleep].

25:01.500 --> 25:03.835
Oh, man.
That's raw, Nilka.

25:03.902 --> 25:04.902
That's raw.

25:04.970 --> 25:05.803
[bleep].

I gave you the piece of fish
to put back in the pan.

25:10.542 --> 25:12.443
Talk about giving up.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.178
This is not possible.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.514
- Nilka, you got this.
- I got it.

25:16.582 --> 25:17.648
- Just focus.
(Nilka) I am.

25:17.716 --> 25:18.850
- Bring it back, you got it.
- 'Cause I don't want to go home.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.284
(Jason)
Tonight, clearly,

25:20.352 --> 25:22.353
uh, Nilka was not herself.

25:22.421 --> 25:25.256
But she a tough cookie.
She'll bounce back.

25:25.324 --> 25:26.424
You're in the weeds,
let's go!

How them lobsters looking?

25:45.077 --> 25:46.444
I can go with the chicken
anytime.

25:46.511 --> 25:48.412
The lobster's
a little cold.

- I need to put it in the oven.
- Heard.

25:49.948 --> 25:52.984

- Yes, Chef.

Oh, [bleep] no.

Today's just not
my [bleep] night.

Don't give up.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.494
I'm not, Chef.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.029
I'm trying to push
without no [bleep] up.

26:05.097 --> 26:07.198
I don't know why.
I'm trying.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.367

Uh, Nilka.

Lobster, urgently!

Behind you.
Lobster's coming now.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.847
This is what you bring me.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.582
Don't touch it.
It's piping hot.

26:24.650 --> 26:25.917
Taste it.
Come on.

26:27.753 --> 26:30.421
Come here, you, a minute.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.056
What's the matter
with you?

26:32.124 --> 26:34.625
We're halfway through.
We started off,

26:34.693 --> 26:35.960
so why can't you
come back?

26:36.028 --> 26:37.295
I'm so mad
at myself right now,

'cause I know I can do it.

26:38.630 --> 26:40.031
[sobbing]
I'm sorry. I don't...

26:40.098 --> 26:42.133
I didn't come here
to lose.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.434
I'm not weak. I don't know
why I'm crying right now.

26:43.502 --> 26:45.369
Get a [bleep] grip.

you're out.

You'll be fine.

Whoa, sorry, Chef.
Scallops.

Yes.

Lately it seems like Ed

for not putting food up?

Yes, we're under pressure,

dropping our [bleep] standards.

for this brigade

29:16.890 --> 29:17.957
in there somewhere.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.024
Wellington, chicken.

29:19.092 --> 29:21.260
Coming back
with duck, beef.

29:21.328 --> 29:22.328
Jason!

29:22.395 --> 29:23.829
Yes, Chef.

29:23.897 --> 29:25.498
Those Wellingtons
are perfectly cooked.

29:25.565 --> 29:27.433
Yes, Chef.

29:27.501 --> 29:28.968
<i>(Announcer) Thanks to Jason,
food is now flowing out of the kitchen.</i>

29:29.035 --> 29:30.936
Excuse me.

29:31.004 --> 29:32.571
<i>(Announcer) And customers seem pleased
with what they're getting.</i>

29:32.639 --> 29:33.572
(Woman)
It sure is good.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.307
It's delicious.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.643
It's good? Great.
How did you enjoy the caviar?

29:37.711 --> 29:39.245
[sighs]
(Woman) That was outstanding.

29:39.312 --> 29:41.080
Turbot, lobster,
beef Wellington.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.114
(Autumn and Nilka)
Yes, Chef.

29:42.182 --> 29:43.916
[bleep].

29:43.984 --> 29:45.417
Just focus.
Take a deep breath.

29:45.485 --> 29:46.752
- Look what you're doing.
- Turbot, urgently.

29:46.820 --> 29:49.321
It's working, Chef.

29:49.389 --> 29:50.256
(Jay)
Listen, don't flip those yet.

29:50.323 --> 29:51.991
Look, they need more color.

29:52.058 --> 29:52.958
- That's why they're not cooking.
- Turbot!

29:53.026 --> 29:54.159
Yes, Chef.
Thirty seconds.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.661
Nilka, you ready?

29:55.729 --> 29:57.463
A few more seconds,
all right?

29:57.531 --> 29:59.064
One second or thirty seconds?
Talk to me.

29:59.132 --> 30:00.199
(Nilka) Yes.
- Yes what?

30:00.267 --> 30:02.535
Yes, I... uh,
a few more minutes.

30:02.602 --> 30:03.702
If you need longer than
a minute, you've gotta tell me.

30:03.770 --> 30:05.604
Okay?

30:05.672 --> 30:06.939
(Ed) You just want to reach over
and, uh, help.

30:07.007 --> 30:08.541
But at the same time,
Nilka's gotta step up

30:08.608 --> 30:09.842
to the plate and
have that station to herself.

30:09.910 --> 30:11.544
Lobster, urgently!

30:11.611 --> 30:12.444
(Nilka)
Yes, Chef.

30:12.512 --> 30:15.915
[bleep] I put my spoon at?

30:15.982 --> 30:17.416
Just put 'em on the trays.

30:17.484 --> 30:19.318
Talk to me.
[bleep] hell.

30:19.386 --> 30:20.886
[loud grunt]

30:20.954 --> 30:23.389
Just breathe. Breathe.
It's gon' be okay.

30:23.456 --> 30:24.657
[bleep] just let me
do it, please.

30:24.724 --> 30:25.824
Just let me do it.

30:25.892 --> 30:26.792
(Benjamin)
Nilka was a mess.

30:26.860 --> 30:27.993
She's just [bleep] crazy.

30:28.061 --> 30:29.094
Come on, guys.

30:29.162 --> 30:31.597
Look at this.
Look.

30:31.665 --> 30:33.065
It's raw.

30:33.133 --> 30:35.000
Nilka!

30:35.068 --> 30:36.869
Yes, Chef?

30:36.937 --> 30:38.037
(Gordon) The lobster is raw.
- Ohh.

30:38.104 --> 30:40.339
Come here, madame!

30:40.407 --> 30:42.641
Come here!
Just touch it, will you?

30:42.709 --> 30:44.610
I just took it
out the pan.

30:44.678 --> 30:46.078
Look at me.
Look at me.

30:46.146 --> 30:48.480
Put it down.
Put it down.

30:48.548 --> 30:50.616
- I'm...
- Look at me! Look at me!

30:50.684 --> 30:53.152
Out!

30:53.219 --> 30:54.453
Get out!

30:54.521 --> 30:55.821
Benjamin!

30:55.889 --> 30:57.222
- <i>Oui</i>, Chef?
- One lobster.

30:57.290 --> 30:58.624
[bleep].
Nilka, get out!

30:58.692 --> 30:59.792
I'm going!

30:59.859 --> 31:02.928
He was angry.

31:02.996 --> 31:05.164
Madame!
Uh, madame!

31:05.231 --> 31:06.298
Madame!

31:06.366 --> 31:08.133
(Nilka)
Yes, Chef?

31:08.201 --> 31:09.435
Take your jacket off
and [bleep] off.

31:09.502 --> 31:11.236
No, Chef, don't say that,
please!

31:11.304 --> 31:14.006
[sobbing]
Chef, please!

31:14.074 --> 31:15.808
Chef, please don't
say that.

31:15.875 --> 31:18.844
Oh, my [bleep] God!

31:27.547 --> 31:29.515
<i>(Announcer)
An hour and fourty minutes</i>

31:31.485 --> 31:32.685
Nilka!

[bleep].

31:40.827 --> 31:41.927
I'm going!

31:41.995 --> 31:43.829
Nilka just kept getting hit...

31:43.897 --> 31:47.700
like a ship by a torpedo
after torpedo after torpedo.

31:47.767 --> 31:49.401
And then, finally,
just... she just sunk

31:49.469 --> 31:50.936
to the bottom of the ocean.

31:51.004 --> 31:52.671
And Chef just...
She needed to go.

31:52.739 --> 31:53.806
Nilka!

31:53.874 --> 31:55.307
- Madame!
- Yes, Chef.

31:55.375 --> 31:57.977
Take your jacket off
and [bleep] off!

31:58.044 --> 31:59.178
No, Chef,

32:08.021 --> 32:09.755
[bleep] now.

32:09.823 --> 32:11.290
- Now pick it up!
- Yes, Chef.

Let's go, please.

32:20.333 --> 32:21.967
Nilka!

32:22.035 --> 32:24.436
- Chef...
- No, no. I'm in the middle of service.

32:24.504 --> 32:26.605
Take your jacket off
and get out of Hell's Kitchen.

32:26.673 --> 32:27.740
I've had enough.

32:27.807 --> 32:28.974
I... I can't do it.

32:29.042 --> 32:30.576
- Okay?
- Please.

32:30.644 --> 32:32.344
Leave... Nilka.
Don't do this to me.

32:32.412 --> 32:34.079
They're under pressure.
We're under pressure.

32:34.147 --> 32:35.447
Take your jacket off
and get out!

32:35.515 --> 32:37.716
I want to still cook
and prove myself, Chef.

32:37.784 --> 32:39.385
Am I gon' stop?
No. 'Cause ts is my dream.

32:39.452 --> 32:41.520
This is my [bleep] destiny.
And this is what I want.

32:41.588 --> 32:42.988
I can cook...

32:43.056 --> 32:44.690
Lobster, turbot,
Welling...

32:44.758 --> 32:46.959
- I want to cook.
- Lobster, turbot, Wellington beef. Let's go.

32:47.027 --> 32:48.260
I don't want to leave
like this, Chef.

32:48.328 --> 32:50.329
Oh, [bleep] me.
[bleep].

32:50.397 --> 32:52.565
- Please go on my station.
(Ed) Nilka wouldn't leave.

32:52.632 --> 32:54.133
You know, she was asked to leave
one time and didn't leave.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.868
Get the hell out of here.

32:55.936 --> 32:57.803
Please.
I can do this [bleep].

32:57.871 --> 32:59.905
(Gordon) Turbot, lobster,
Wellington beef.

32:59.973 --> 33:01.040
(Benjamin) <i>Oui</i>, Chef.
- Nilka!

33:01.107 --> 33:03.609
- I want to cook!
- Get out!

33:03.677 --> 33:05.044
I want to cook.
I can do this. Please!

33:05.111 --> 33:07.346
Hey, guys. I'm telling you now.
Do something for me.

33:07.414 --> 33:09.114
Get her out of here!

33:09.182 --> 33:11.216
- Nilka, you gotta go.
- I want to cook.

33:11.284 --> 33:12.451
- Benjamin!
- <i>Oui</i>, Chef.

33:12.519 --> 33:13.752
- I can do this.
- Get her out!

33:13.820 --> 33:15.254
- Nilka, you gotta go.
- I can do this.

33:15.322 --> 33:16.422
You have to go. Chef tells you
you gotta go, you gotta go.

33:16.489 --> 33:17.990
Go, go, go.

33:18.058 --> 33:20.693
Hurricane Nilka
just had

33:20.760 --> 33:21.994
an absolute,
category-five meltdown.

33:22.062 --> 33:25.464
Oh, my [bleep] God.
I don't want to leave.

33:25.532 --> 33:27.399
Nilka, get out.

33:27.467 --> 33:28.534
Get your jacket off
and get out!

33:28.602 --> 33:30.703
This is so [bleep] up.

33:30.770 --> 33:32.838
Gave up my whole life
for this [bleep].

33:32.906 --> 33:34.273
(Nilka) It hurts to get kicked out
of here like this.

33:34.341 --> 33:35.608
It really, really does.

33:35.675 --> 33:37.576
Like, I don't want to take
my jacket off.

33:37.644 --> 33:39.411
[bleep], [bleep],
[bleep], [bleep].

33:39.479 --> 33:41.347
And it... oh, it just...
it pisses me off

33:41.414 --> 33:43.115
that it went down like this.

33:43.183 --> 33:45.551
It really, really did.
It really, really did.

33:47.654 --> 33:48.921
<i>(Announcer)

33:53.827 --> 33:55.728

for the [bleep] beef?

34:02.002 --> 34:03.535
Yes, I do, Chef.
Right here.

34:03.603 --> 34:04.737
Once Nilka left,
everything calmed down.

34:04.804 --> 34:05.771
Everything went perfect.

34:05.839 --> 34:06.972
Hot, coming down.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.141
- Hot, coming down.
- Backs, backs.

34:09.208 --> 34:10.775
Service, please.

34:10.844 --> 34:12.610
Good job, guys.

34:12.679 --> 34:15.080
Hallelujah!
Finally!

34:15.148 --> 34:18.283

I don't.

34:35.335 --> 34:37.101
[sniffles]
I came here for a reason.

34:40.739 --> 34:42.708
I was hoping I'd get
to see you again.

34:42.775 --> 34:44.610
Listen,
I just want to say

34:44.678 --> 34:46.879
you walk out of here
with your head up high.

34:46.946 --> 34:50.882
Sadly, you're not ready
to take that head chef's job.

34:50.949 --> 34:54.152
But what you are ready
to continue doing

34:54.219 --> 34:56.455
is following your dream.
Don't stop that.

34:56.523 --> 34:58.090
I'm not, I'm just
so mad at myself

34:58.158 --> 34:59.692
'cause I think
I was ready.

34:59.759 --> 35:02.661
But tonight proved
otherwise, so...

35:02.729 --> 35:05.531
Listen, you have done
phenomenally well.

35:05.598 --> 35:07.232
I've never come out here
to say good-bye,

35:07.300 --> 35:09.034
but I wanted to make
the effort to say good-bye

35:09.102 --> 35:10.569
and say thank you.

35:10.637 --> 35:13.072
- Thank you.
- Come here.

35:13.139 --> 35:14.273
[sobs]
Thanks.

35:14.340 --> 35:17.409
Yes? Now.

35:17.477 --> 35:18.677
- One more thing.
- Yes, Chef?

35:18.745 --> 35:20.179
Your jacket.

35:20.246 --> 35:21.647
[laughing]
No, do I have to?

35:21.715 --> 35:23.348
- Your jacket.
- I don't want to.

35:23.416 --> 35:25.484
[laughing]
Thank you, Chef.

35:25.552 --> 35:26.819
- Good night, madame.
- Good night.

35:26.886 --> 35:28.187
Well done.

35:28.254 --> 35:29.154
Head up high.

35:29.222 --> 35:30.189
I will, always.

35:38.965 --> 35:42.501
That may have been
your best service ever.

35:42.569 --> 35:44.937
We set the goal
of two and a half hours.

35:45.004 --> 35:47.873
You accomplished that
in two hours and fifteen.

35:47.941 --> 35:52.144
But why now?

35:52.212 --> 35:53.212
- Ed.
- Yes, Chef?

35:53.279 --> 35:54.480
Shaky start

35:54.547 --> 35:56.081
because you were panicking.

35:56.149 --> 35:58.851
However, second table,
third table, you fought back.

35:58.918 --> 36:01.220
That, for me,
is the most important part.

36:01.287 --> 36:03.222
- Jason.
- Yes, Chef?

36:03.289 --> 36:05.924
You nailed every piece of meat
on there tonight.

36:05.992 --> 36:07.659
And for the first time
in Hell's Kitchen,

36:07.727 --> 36:09.228
you came out
of your shell.

36:09.295 --> 36:11.330
You busted your ass
and you led.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.300
Go up to the dorms

36:15.368 --> 36:16.835
and come to a consensus

36:16.903 --> 36:19.571
on which two people
are up for elimination.

36:22.542 --> 36:24.309
Go upstairs, guys.
Start talking.

36:24.377 --> 36:25.611
(All)
Yes, Chef.

36:28.748 --> 36:29.882
Wow.

36:29.949 --> 36:31.950
That [bleep] was crazy.

36:32.018 --> 36:34.353
(Autumn)
It was sad to see Nilka go.

36:34.420 --> 36:36.588
And it sucks that
we have to pick two people

36:36.656 --> 36:37.823
on a night like tonight.

36:37.891 --> 36:38.991
Okay, so what's
your pick?

36:41.694 --> 36:42.828
I guess I would have
to go with Ed and Autumn.

36:42.896 --> 36:44.429
What?

36:44.497 --> 36:46.932
You know, I was one person
on the garnish station tonight.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.467
And I think anybody on that
station would get out-weeded,

36:48.535 --> 36:49.968
you know, where

36:50.036 --> 36:51.503
they had to fight back or
show Chef they could fight back.

36:51.571 --> 36:53.205
Oh, I think I should stay
for fighting back

36:53.273 --> 36:54.506
and going 110%.

36:54.574 --> 36:55.808
But I think
some people might

36:55.875 --> 36:57.676
be scared of me.

36:57.744 --> 36:59.978
(Jay)
The only obvious thing to me

37:00.046 --> 37:01.413
is to go bigger picture.

37:01.481 --> 37:04.416
And if it's bigger picture,
I would pick Autumn.

37:04.484 --> 37:05.717
(Autumn) I mean, if you look
at the big picture,

37:05.785 --> 37:07.386
I would vote
for Ed and Jason.

37:07.453 --> 37:08.687
That would be my vote.

37:08.755 --> 37:10.756
Damn.

37:10.824 --> 37:12.191
Yeah, that's my vote.

37:12.258 --> 37:16.195
Why did I get voted
and not Ben or Jay or Holli?

37:16.262 --> 37:18.530
- Why me? I want to know.
- Um, okay, so...

37:18.598 --> 37:21.967
It was just...
I think one ticket dragged.

37:22.035 --> 37:23.135
- From me?
- But... yeah.

37:23.203 --> 37:25.037
- The one...
- A ticket dragged?

37:25.104 --> 37:28.006
- Oh, no. Not tonight.
- Nothing dr... From me?

37:28.074 --> 37:29.575
[Jason laughs]

37:29.642 --> 37:31.543
I don't have...

37:31.611 --> 37:33.178
No, there was...
I dragged nothing tonight.

37:33.246 --> 37:34.847
No matter what I do,

37:34.914 --> 37:37.216
these people still
on my damn back

37:37.283 --> 37:40.352
like I got
some big-ass target.

37:40.420 --> 37:41.653
It's a tough one.

37:41.721 --> 37:43.388
(Jay)
If it was Nilka here,

37:43.456 --> 37:45.390
it would be a [bleep]
no-brainer, you know?

37:59.472 --> 38:02.674
Okay.

38:02.742 --> 38:04.276
Have you come to a consensus?

38:04.344 --> 38:05.210
(All)
Yes, Chef.

38:05.278 --> 38:07.679
Benjamin.

38:07.747 --> 38:09.047
First nominee
and why, please.

38:09.115 --> 38:11.350
First nominee
was Ed, Chef.

38:11.417 --> 38:13.285
- Ed. Why?
- It was a very difficult decision.

38:13.353 --> 38:14.753
He's a good cook,

38:14.821 --> 38:16.755
but he kind of
slowed down service

38:16.823 --> 38:19.258
and he needed help
on his station, Chef.

38:19.325 --> 38:20.425
Second nominee
and why, please.

38:26.699 --> 38:28.467
Second nomination,
Chef, is...

38:38.504 --> 38:40.405
<i>(Announcer)
After cooking together as one team</i>

38:40.472 --> 38:42.373
<i>for the first time,</i>

38:42.441 --> 38:43.341
<i>the remaining chefs
had another task</i>

38:43.409 --> 38:45.109
<i>to complete together...</i>

38:45.177 --> 38:46.978
<i>nominating two people
for elimination.</i>

38:47.046 --> 38:48.246
The first is Ed.

38:48.314 --> 38:50.281
Benjamin, second nominee
and why, please.

38:53.852 --> 38:55.954
Second nominee
is Autumn, Chef.

38:56.021 --> 38:56.988
Autumn.

38:57.056 --> 39:00.725
Not again.

39:00.793 --> 39:02.393
Why Autumn?

39:02.461 --> 39:05.263
She is the weakest cook
on the team...

39:05.331 --> 39:06.531
of both teams.

39:06.599 --> 39:07.765
Ed, Autumn,
step forward.

39:12.805 --> 39:14.038
Ed,

39:14.106 --> 39:15.039
why should you
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:15.107 --> 39:16.574
I'm not gonna give up.

39:16.642 --> 39:18.276
Uh, I keep battling back
like you said.

39:18.344 --> 39:19.644
- Yeah.
- And I will continue to do that.

39:19.712 --> 39:20.945
I will keep working hard,
I will keep working

39:21.013 --> 39:22.580
at a fast pace,
and I will keep communicating

39:22.648 --> 39:25.016
just like I do
every night in the kitchens.

39:25.084 --> 39:26.351
You were standing in front
of two of your pans

39:26.418 --> 39:29.988
that had burned dry.

39:30.055 --> 39:33.124
The pans were on the verge
of having a hole in them.

39:33.192 --> 39:34.492
The fact that
you were standing

39:34.560 --> 39:35.493
three inches
in front of it,

39:35.561 --> 39:36.561
you didn't notice it...

39:36.629 --> 39:39.197
careless.

39:39.264 --> 39:41.532
Autumn...
Truthfully,

39:41.600 --> 39:43.134
why should you
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:43.202 --> 39:44.435
Tonight, I did a good job,

39:44.503 --> 39:46.471
and I showed
that I can bounce back.

39:46.538 --> 39:48.473
- I can work.
- But maybe too late.

39:48.540 --> 39:50.441
Okay.

39:50.509 --> 39:52.944
Right.
My decision is...

40:01.887 --> 40:04.989
Ed.

40:05.057 --> 40:06.691
Take off your jacket.

40:10.763 --> 40:12.730
- Now, listen.
- Absolutely.

40:12.798 --> 40:15.099
I've got one thing
to say to you.

40:15.167 --> 40:17.368
Congratulations.
You're in the final six.

40:17.436 --> 40:18.503
- Well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

40:18.570 --> 40:19.904
Thank you very much,
Chef.

40:19.972 --> 40:21.472
- Get back in line.
- Are you kidding me?

40:21.540 --> 40:23.307
Autumn,
take your jacket off.

40:23.375 --> 40:25.543
[laughing]
Congratulations.

40:25.611 --> 40:26.878
[laughing]
You're in the final six.

40:26.945 --> 40:29.247
Hey, madame.
Hello.

40:29.314 --> 40:32.116
Let's go, beautiful eyes.
Holli, let's go.

40:32.184 --> 40:34.352
Jacket, please.

40:34.420 --> 40:35.520
- Well done.
- Thank you.

40:35.587 --> 40:36.721
Well done, well done.

40:36.789 --> 40:38.423
Hey, Mr. Happy Face.
Big boy.

40:38.490 --> 40:40.224
Get your ass down here.
Congratulations.

40:40.292 --> 40:42.193
No, no.
Hey, Blue Jay.

40:42.261 --> 40:43.928
- Get back in there. You're the happy face.
- [bleep] out of the way.

40:43.996 --> 40:45.797
[laughing]
Well done.

40:45.864 --> 40:48.332
Well done.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.034
Benjamin, congratulations.
You made the final six.

40:50.102 --> 40:51.335
- Thank you, Chef.
- Well done.

40:51.403 --> 40:53.371
Let's go, Blue Jay.

40:53.439 --> 40:54.906
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Chef.

40:54.973 --> 40:56.841
- Yes, hey? Well done. Ed.
- Thank you. Thank you.

40:56.909 --> 40:58.176
- Yes, Chef?
- Gotcha.

41:00.612 --> 41:02.013
Listen to me.

41:02.081 --> 41:04.115
The challenges
are gonna get harder.

41:04.183 --> 41:06.317
The competition's
gonna get more fierce.

41:06.385 --> 41:08.720
And look at you...
one dynamic team.

41:12.991 --> 41:14.792
- Well done.
(All) Thank you, Chef.

41:14.860 --> 41:17.595
Now [bleep] off upstairs.

41:17.663 --> 41:19.697
(Autumn)
We're six people,

41:19.765 --> 41:22.667
and it's, uh, time
to bring out the claws.

41:22.735 --> 41:24.936
(Jason)
Ed, Autumn, and Jay

41:25.003 --> 41:26.404
underestimating me?

41:26.472 --> 41:28.005
That's a problem.

41:28.073 --> 41:29.507
I'm not being arrogant,
but I'm gonna promise you,

41:29.575 --> 41:31.075
I'm gonna win.

41:31.143 --> 41:32.076
(Jay)
Now it's every man for himself.

41:32.144 --> 41:33.644
You have one bad service,

41:33.712 --> 41:34.946
there's a real good chance
you're going home.

41:35.013 --> 41:37.081
So I mean, I need
to strive for perfection

41:37.149 --> 41:38.282
from here on out.

41:38.350 --> 41:40.485
(Gordon)
Tonight was the best service

41:40.552 --> 41:41.719
we've had in Hell's Kitchen,

41:41.787 --> 41:44.222
and that's why I
rewarded the final six.

41:44.289 --> 41:46.390
Now, only
the best chefs remain.

41:46.458 --> 41:49.427
Nilka was clearly
out of her depth.

<i>(Announcer) Next time,
on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:01.422 --> 42:04.275
Somebody here is going to be
the chef at the Savoy in London.

42:04.294 --> 42:07.042
<i>(Announcer) the chefs think
that they are the final six.</i>

42:07.054 --> 42:09.296
I feel like I need to almost start
talking with a British accent.

42:09.321 --> 42:12.479
<i>(Announcer) But Chef Ramsay brings
some fresh blood into the competition.</i>

42:12.491 --> 42:13.759
I thought I was gonna
start crying.

42:13.771 --> 42:15.779
It just sucks.
It just...

42:15.798 --> 42:19.110
<i>(Announcer) With the pressure
to stand out more intense than ever...</i>

42:19.121 --> 42:21.305
Time's running out, guys.
For everybody.

42:21.329 --> 42:24.577
<i>(Announcer) a difficult dish on
the menu has the chefs totally confused.</i>

42:24.588 --> 42:27.594
- Tomato basil salad...
- He has so many little components...

42:27.618 --> 42:29.802
I don't even know how we'll do it.
Ridiculous.

42:29.816 --> 42:31.871
- Stop playin'.
<i>(Announcer) During dinner service...</i>

42:31.894 --> 42:34.595
- How long, then?
<i>(Announcer) The chefs have a total meltdown.</i>

42:34.607 --> 42:37.272
- Why aren't they cooking?
- The g... Oh, for the Wellington?

42:37.295 --> 42:39.409
Oh my God.
It was ridiculous.

42:39.421 --> 42:41.500
Pretty soon Chef's gonna
kick us all out of the kitchen.

42:41.511 --> 42:43.883
<i>(Announcer)
Will any of the final six survive?</i>

42:43.902 --> 42:46.333
[bleep]
No one gives a [bleep]!
