-Feel?

01:15.617 --> 01:18.829
I feel that I was a nightmare.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.165
I made terrible choices.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.876
I drove my family away. I--

01:27.587 --> 01:29.548
I hurt people.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.011
I didn’t mean to, but there it is.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.431

I can’t do anything about before.
That’s done.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.975

02:22.601 --> 02:24.186
And my girls.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.067
I can be their father again.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.110

We are not in touch anymore.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.794
Well, she’s not obligated to.

after all I’ve done for you?

20:40.156 --> 20:42.241
-[chuckles]
-Hey.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.828
Six years in county
beats 12 years in the state house.

20:45.911 --> 20:49.290
Those boys down there would’ve
spread you out like my crazy aunt’s quilt.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.709
Yeah, that was Manny’s grease, not yours.

20:51.792 --> 20:54.170
-Speaking of the king...
-[can hits bench]

21:04.472 --> 21:07.808
-I didn’t ask for this.
-So give it back.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.186
Uh-huh.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.063
You heard about Manny?

21:13.147 --> 21:14.565
What?

21:14.648 --> 21:16.066
Cancer.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.570
In the butt. Matter of time now.

21:19.653 --> 21:22.823
Well, he had a good run.
Junior can steer things now.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.034
Nothin’ to do with me.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.660
-Clean slate, huh?
-Oh, yeah.

21:27.453 --> 21:32.082
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but you’re on the hook here, Joey.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.252
Manny’s gotta go.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.004
You--

21:43.135 --> 21:44.762
You said cancer.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.890
Before then. Now. Yesterday.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.558
Fuck are you talking about?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.560
That old-time religion.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.521
Old man’s found God.

21:53.604 --> 21:55.815
Cravin’ salvation by way of confession.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.608
Bullshit. He’d never flip.

21:57.691 --> 22:01.612
Old Manny wouldn’t,
but dying’s made him smaller.

22:02.488 --> 22:03.781
So let’s consider now

22:03.864 --> 22:07.076
specifically the kinds of things
that he might confess to.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.912
Say, vis-à-vis, you.

22:11.622 --> 22:12.581
Yeah.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.375
Now you’re seein’ it.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.753
You think Phil’s comment
about Bill Caldwell was coincidental?

22:17.837 --> 22:20.548
-Manny’s talking to Phil?
-Crazy, right?

22:20.631 --> 22:23.133
First he wants Phil hit,
then his asshole’s melting

22:23.217 --> 22:25.219
and he wants to give him absolution.

22:25.302 --> 22:28.305
Christ forgives. The sinner is saved.
All of that.

22:28.389 --> 22:32.476
Phil’s nudging him towards a deposition,
and if he lives long enough, a grand jury.

22:32.560 --> 22:36.230
But even if not, you’d be inside so fast,
your bunk would still be warm.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.940
And no favors this time.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.734
What do we do?

22:40.818 --> 22:42.820
“We”? You got a turd in your pocket?

22:43.904 --> 22:46.782
You know, Phil’s been trying
to butt-fuck you since forever,

22:46.865 --> 22:48.367
and if Manny sings, he can do it.

22:48.450 --> 22:51.036
And if you do get keistered,
I’d worry I’m next in line,

22:51.120 --> 22:52.871
and let me tell you
what ain’t gonna happen.

22:52.955 --> 22:54.290
If I was gonna roll over,

22:54.373 --> 22:57.376
wouldn’t I do that
before serving my fucking time?

22:58.002 --> 23:01.005
-I did the job they wanted--
-No, half the job. Semantics.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.799
-Fuck you. I took the fall.
-[engine starts]

23:07.469 --> 23:09.305
[chuckles]

23:09.388 --> 23:12.224
You be sure and send her
some flowers now, son.

23:15.060 --> 23:18.355
The point is, you left Phil breathing
all those years ago,

23:18.439 --> 23:19.732
or it wouldn’t be a problem now.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.525
The way I see it, it’s your mess.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.988
But hey,
I’m more into carrots than sticks, so...

23:27.323 --> 23:30.242
let’s talk about your girls instead.

23:32.286 --> 23:34.622
Junior high by now, hmm?

23:36.498 --> 23:38.626
Family court judge by the name of Winthrop

23:38.709 --> 23:43.297
found himself “over-served” one evening
a while back.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.592
And he dented up the front of his Prius

23:46.675 --> 23:49.011
with the skull of an address-free citizen.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.805
You might say I helped him sweep that up.

23:51.889 --> 23:56.602
And I know that he would fall all
over himself doing me a favor in return.

23:56.685 --> 23:59.605
Like revising your custody deal,
for instance,

23:59.688 --> 24:02.024
so you can see your daughters again.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.737
What am I thinking? I gotta drive.

24:08.906 --> 24:11.784
Manny goes. You get your girls back.
That’s the carrot.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.871
The stick? Who wants to think about that?

24:16.747 --> 24:17.831
Do it fast.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.751
Answer me on that if I call.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.588
-Don’t make me come after you.
-[engine starts]

24:46.610 --> 24:49.279
[insect buzzing]

25:10.926 --> 25:13.971
[man on TV: faint]

25:20.185 --> 25:21.770
He lives.

25:22.730 --> 25:23.939
Hi, Mom.

25:26.024 --> 25:29.778
Oh, I guess you needed the rest.
That’s okay.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.822
-Is that a bruise?
-Oh, no.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.575
That was there already. From a door.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.660
-You need a hand?
-Nah. Makin’ soup.

25:41.165 --> 25:45.210
[Joe groans] Hard time sleeping.

25:45.294 --> 25:49.006
-Well, this is a big adjustment.
-Mmm.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.424
Give it time.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.764
I’m sorry I wasn’t here
when you arrived. I--

25:56.847 --> 26:01.351
-I, uh-- I already told him.
-It’s okay. It’s okay. [groans]

26:05.731 --> 26:09.067
-Got our wires crossed, I guess.
-Hmm.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.531
-What are your--
-Dad says--

26:14.615 --> 26:16.617
-Sorry. Go ahead.
-No, no, you first.

26:17.993 --> 26:21.580
I was just wondering
what are your plans for work.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.460
[Joe] I haven’t been home a day yet.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.337
It’s a reasonable question.

26:29.046 --> 26:32.007
Your first night home
and you’re out till dawn

26:32.090 --> 26:33.675
with your father’s truck.

26:33.759 --> 26:39.139
I just don’t want things
going back to how they were.

26:40.808 --> 26:41.892
Not here.

26:45.896 --> 26:48.524
Dad says you don’t speak
to your grandchildren.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.734
[Joe’s mom] That’s Elaine’s decision.

26:52.027 --> 26:55.531
We just want what’s best for them.

26:55.614 --> 26:56.740
What about me?

27:00.410 --> 27:03.705
It’s impossible to you
that I might have changed?

27:08.252 --> 27:09.628
You know...

27:11.088 --> 27:13.507
every Sunday in church...

27:15.050 --> 27:17.886
I have to see Phil Coakley.

27:18.720 --> 27:22.099
And everybody there sees me seeing him.

27:23.976 --> 27:29.314
Have you ever thought
what that might feel like... to me?

27:32.901 --> 27:34.570
Have you changed?

27:37.781 --> 27:39.366
[Joe sighs]

27:52.004 --> 27:53.505
You know what this is?

27:54.840 --> 27:57.843
You expect me to be impressed
’cause you didn’t drink in jail?

27:57.926 --> 27:59.720
Dad! Come on!

27:59.803 --> 28:01.889
Look, see, this is complicated.

28:01.972 --> 28:04.224
No, it’s not.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.935
You say you’ve changed.
Good. I hope it’s true.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.021
I’ve prayed for it long enough.

28:09.104 --> 28:12.149
I’m happy you’re home, and I love you,

28:12.232 --> 28:16.403
but you don’t get extra points
for doing what’s simply required,

28:16.486 --> 28:17.946
what everybody else does.

28:18.572 --> 28:21.325
-I can’t believe this shit.
-You have work to do, Joe!

28:22.534 --> 28:25.037
[door opens, closes]

28:28.749 --> 28:30.542
[door opens]

28:36.673 --> 28:38.342
[keys jangle]

28:39.760 --> 28:41.428
[door closes]

29:00.072 --> 29:01.073
[engine stops]

29:01.156 --> 29:06.036
I am profoundly sorry, Phil.

29:09.373 --> 29:12.251
Bill Caldwell. Billy was my friend.

29:12.334 --> 29:15.379
And I just wish he’d-- he’d...

29:16.672 --> 29:18.632
worked the steps.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.873
[ringing]

30:02.092 --> 30:03.176
Hi, Phil.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.851
I was out of line,
the way I spoke to you last night.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.728
I thought about this a lot,

30:12.811 --> 30:16.148
what I wanted to say to you
when I finally saw you,

30:16.231 --> 30:18.025
and that wasn’t it.

30:18.108 --> 30:22.279
What I did wanna say
was that I am profoundly sorry.

30:24.072 --> 30:27.034
I was truly in fear for my life.

30:27.868 --> 30:30.996
I felt I was defending myself,

30:31.079 --> 30:32.914
but that doesn’t excuse the--

30:34.750 --> 30:37.502
I don’t even remember it. Insane.

30:37.586 --> 30:39.796
-Which is it?
-Which?

30:39.880 --> 30:43.550
You were in fear for your life
or you don’t remember.

30:43.633 --> 30:44.634
Which is it?

30:46.553 --> 30:50.599
The point is, I do take responsibility,

30:50.682 --> 30:54.853
and I’m ready to move ahead
with a-- with a clean life, a good life.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.356
Take responsibility and just--

30:58.607 --> 31:00.067
You know. Amends.

31:03.737 --> 31:05.989
You mentioned Bill Caldwell.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.492
He was my friend.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.035
I loved him.

31:11.203 --> 31:14.623
I just wish he’d gotten
into the program like I have,

31:14.706 --> 31:16.375
worked the steps.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.502
There’s a whole other world
you can live in.

31:18.585 --> 31:19.961
He just didn’t know.

31:26.468 --> 31:29.304
You are within 100 yards of my home here.

31:30.514 --> 31:34.393
But I’m not interested in some
chickenshit restraining order violation.

31:35.811 --> 31:38.980
For you, I want the needle.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.067
-And I’m gonna get it.
-Okay.

31:42.734 --> 31:43.819
Okay.

31:45.695 --> 31:46.947
“Anger eats the vessel.”

31:50.242 --> 31:52.035
[engine starts]

32:08.677 --> 32:10.095
[man] I guess you heard, huh?

32:10.178 --> 32:11.388
How’s he doing?

32:11.972 --> 32:13.390
Can I, um--?

32:14.558 --> 32:16.101
He took care of me in there.

32:27.154 --> 32:28.780
-[monitor beeping]
-[mutters]

32:31.658 --> 32:32.784
Hey, Manny.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.328
[Manny] Ha.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.623
You’re on the same drugs as me.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.586
-How you feeling?
-Eh.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.921
I’m working on my anger.

32:45.005 --> 32:46.214
[snickers]

32:46.298 --> 32:48.425
-What?
-Oh, nothing.

32:49.509 --> 32:52.387
That’s not something
I thought I’d ever hear you say.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.390
[chuckles] What’d it ever get me?

32:55.474 --> 32:57.559
All this. Lots of things.

32:58.059 --> 33:00.395
Yeah, well, I don’t want ’em anymore.

33:04.858 --> 33:06.651
Dan gave me a bag.

33:06.735 --> 33:08.778
-You did your bid.
-Yeah.

33:09.446 --> 33:10.864
But I blew the job.

33:10.947 --> 33:15.076
And I warned you
about the drinking and the drugs.

33:15.827 --> 33:16.828
You did.

33:16.912 --> 33:20.373
I should’ve listened,
but since I didn’t...

33:21.041 --> 33:23.960
I guess I was expecting someone
to clip me in there,

33:24.044 --> 33:26.922
-not pay me when I came out.
-[laughs]

33:27.005 --> 33:29.216
If you knew how much it cost

33:29.299 --> 33:34.054
to sell that imperfect self-defense line.
[laughs]

33:34.137 --> 33:35.305
Manny, come on.

33:35.388 --> 33:37.057
Yeah, I admit.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.726
I was angry about Phil.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.229
You blew our clean shot at him.

33:42.312 --> 33:43.730
Hmm.

33:43.813 --> 33:48.401
But since you’d
already taken care of Billy...

33:49.569 --> 33:52.239
even though he went over to them...

33:54.115 --> 33:56.201
he was your boy.

33:56.743 --> 33:59.037
So that meant something.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.207
I bet Junior disagreed, huh?

34:02.290 --> 34:04.376
Yeah, well, Junior has a lot of--

34:04.918 --> 34:08.880
a lot of different ideas
about a lot of things.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.301
Funny you mention talking to Phil.

34:14.636 --> 34:17.514
-Give me that fuckin’ thing. I hurt.
-In a sec.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.306
Because what I hear,

34:19.391 --> 34:23.937
there’s this notion floating now
that maybe Billy wasn’t an accident.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.106
-There’s always talk.
-Manny.

34:27.065 --> 34:30.025
Are you talking to the DA? Huh?

34:31.860 --> 34:36.283
You know, sometimes when I’m sleeping...

34:37.324 --> 34:39.744
I think I see what hell looks like...

34:41.079 --> 34:45.208
and it ain’t fire and it ain’t devils.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.460
You know what it is?

34:48.128 --> 34:49.629
It’s just me.

34:50.714 --> 34:54.426
And I ain’t no goddamn stool pigeon.

34:57.971 --> 34:58.972
I’m sorry.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.807
I don’t know. I...

35:01.391 --> 35:03.685
It’s been a tough few days, is all.

35:05.395 --> 35:06.730
[Manny] Tough, yeah.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.025
Tough for everybody.

35:34.716 --> 35:38.011
[muffled coughing continues]

35:46.978 --> 35:49.856
[Joe] He nodded out.
Pressed the thing there and just...

35:51.483 --> 35:54.152
It’s the pain. We upped the dosage.

35:54.235 --> 35:55.987
[snoring]

36:05.413 --> 36:06.956
We should probably let him rest.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.084
Of course. Of course.

36:11.628 --> 36:12.879
I’m Joe.

36:12.962 --> 36:13.963
Charlotte Boyd.

36:14.047 --> 36:15.548
Old friend.

36:16.758 --> 36:19.427
So how is he-- I mean, it’s bad, huh?

36:19.511 --> 36:21.471
I’m a hospice worker.

36:21.554 --> 36:24.307
Yeah, well, he’s a fighter.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.399
Charlotte?

36:33.692 --> 36:35.777
Thank you for taking care of my friend.

36:47.997 --> 36:49.666
You’re gonna sit there
with your stupid fuckin’ shirt

36:49.749 --> 36:51.418
and tell me I can’t see my own father?

36:51.501 --> 36:52.669
My kids can’t go?

36:52.752 --> 36:55.296
He just wants you to call first, Junior,
that’s all.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.589
Oh, I see.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.925
Did this cocksucker call first?

36:59.008 --> 37:00.093
Hey, Junior.

37:00.176 --> 37:03.763
-[boy] I thought we were gonna see Poppy.
-[Joe] Wow.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.849
[Junior] Go inside
and play the quiet game, okay?

37:05.932 --> 37:08.810
Oh, man. You guys are so big.

37:09.936 --> 37:12.856
[Junior] Hey, close that door behind you.
The A/C’s on, all right?

37:15.233 --> 37:17.402
-Goddamn, they grow so fast.
-Yeah, how you doin’, Joe?

37:17.485 --> 37:20.363
[groaning]

37:20.447 --> 37:24.993
Now, you lay there with your hands
on your scrotum and you listen.

37:25.869 --> 37:27.454
You are not welcome here.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.789
This is a family time,

37:29.873 --> 37:34.753
and this family no longer has any use
for dumb-fuck, grief-causing policemen.

37:36.004 --> 37:39.174
Now, you come around here again
bothering my father,

37:39.257 --> 37:40.341
disturbing his rest...

37:41.551 --> 37:43.344
and I’m gonna bring you down
to my playroom.

37:45.221 --> 37:48.308
Yeah. You know what happens there.

37:50.393 --> 37:53.897
-All right. Come on. Let’s get up.
-[groaning]

37:53.980 --> 37:56.483
I think we’d all feel better
if you moved on.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.282
Hey, Junior?

38:04.365 --> 38:08.203
Any idea what Phil Coakley
talks to your dad about?

38:08.787 --> 38:10.789
Besides the Bible, I mean.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.208
Now, why would you say
something like that?

38:13.291 --> 38:16.169
I mean, all these years
my father carries your crazy ass,

38:16.252 --> 38:18.755
you’re implying
he’s some kind of rat or something?

38:18.838 --> 38:21.174
All right.
Yo, break this motherfucker’s mouth.

38:21.257 --> 38:24.010

[whistling]

38:48.451 --> 38:49.619
Hi.

38:49.702 --> 38:52.247
Uh, can I have a coffee, please?

38:53.373 --> 38:54.624
Thank you.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.049
Hello.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.009
Oh, hi.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.225
Here.

39:12.308 --> 39:13.685
Thank you.

39:13.768 --> 39:16.479
No, thank you
for taking care of my friend.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.023
You said that already.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.275
Hmm.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.611
Are you from Bradley originally?

39:23.695 --> 39:26.739
I moved from Montreal
around two years ago.

39:26.823 --> 39:28.491
-You got family?
-No.

39:28.575 --> 39:31.369
I-- Well, uh, no.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.497
Do you work there every day
at Manny’s house?

39:34.581 --> 39:38.084
-Six days a week usually.
-Hmm. Wow.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.752
And all of his-- I don’t know--

39:39.836 --> 39:43.506
uh, medication and monitoring
and all that, that’s all you?

39:43.590 --> 39:44.883
That’s me.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.843
And another girl. We do split shifts.

39:46.926 --> 39:50.471
Wow.
That must feel like a big responsibility.

39:51.848 --> 39:55.310
I guess it is. I don’t feel overwhelmed.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.394
No?

39:56.477 --> 39:58.521
But I’m good at helping people.

39:58.605 --> 39:59.939
I guess your agency provides you

40:00.023 --> 40:04.402
with supplies and medication and whatnot
for there at the house.

40:06.696 --> 40:09.574
My father had lymphoma.

40:10.450 --> 40:11.451
And... [sighs]

40:12.368 --> 40:15.121
They had him on
so much different stuff there.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.998
At the end...

40:18.207 --> 40:20.168
he didn’t know what day it was.

40:20.877 --> 40:23.504
-I’m sorry. It’s a terrible disease.
-Yeah.

40:24.213 --> 40:26.841
Actually, I just moved back here myself.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.635
Everyone’s gone now.

40:28.718 --> 40:31.346
I was, uh, doing some consulting--

40:31.429 --> 40:32.472
-[spits]
-Whoa.

40:32.555 --> 40:33.598
[Charlotte] Oh!

40:33.973 --> 40:35.725
-What the fuck?
-Sergeant Thom Doyle,

40:35.808 --> 40:38.978

40:39.562 --> 40:43.232
And you, sir,
are a worthless goddamn punk.

40:43.816 --> 40:45.193
[spits]

40:45.276 --> 40:46.653
Ooh.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.159
I think I’m gonna skip this one.

40:54.577 --> 40:57.622
Do you think
you might wanna get together again?

40:57.705 --> 41:00.708
Like I said, everyone’s gone now, and...

41:02.543 --> 41:04.087
I like you.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.009
[men] Whoo!

41:12.804 --> 41:15.765
You know, if you want,
I could set you up with Toni.

41:17.141 --> 41:20.353
Little, uh, welcome-home toss?

41:21.270 --> 41:22.730
You know we take care of cops here.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.524
Bring that pussy over here, girl. Yeah.

41:24.607 --> 41:28.277
Hell, your old buddy, he’s on a weekly.

41:28.361 --> 41:31.572
[man] Come on. Come on. What’s wrong? Hey!

41:33.116 --> 41:35.451
Bruno. Fuck. Get that fucker out of here.

41:35.535 --> 41:37.036
All right, come on.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.496
Get the fuck out.

41:40.790 --> 41:42.834
-Who’s the peacock?
-It’s her old man.

41:43.876 --> 41:45.920
They got this whole jealousy thing going.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.798
Anyway, if you wanna spend
some time with Toni, it’s on me.

41:48.881 --> 41:51.426
-Pass.
-Suit yourself.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.469
Hey, you want any, uh--? [snorts]

41:53.553 --> 41:55.513
Oh, no, thanks.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.100
[snorting]

41:59.183 --> 42:00.935
Whooooo!

42:01.019 --> 42:02.061
Oh, yeah.

42:02.812 --> 42:03.896
[snorts]

42:13.865 --> 42:15.199
Yeah.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.918
[man on TV] <i>Marion Barry tonight</i>

Excuse me.

42:42.769 --> 42:44.520
That is not your vehicle.

42:44.604 --> 42:46.522
Oh, Dad-- Dad said it was fine.

42:46.606 --> 42:49.650
Where have you been all day?
And why are you rushing in like this?

42:50.485 --> 42:51.903
[scoffs]

42:51.986 --> 42:53.071
[sighs]

42:53.654 --> 42:57.241
For your information, I went to a meeting.

42:57.325 --> 42:58.785
-Where?
-What?

42:58.868 --> 43:00.995
Where was the meeting you were at?

43:01.079 --> 43:04.165
I-- It’s anonymous, Mom.

43:04.248 --> 43:07.043
We’re not gonna do things like this.
I’m telling you right now.

43:07.126 --> 43:09.295
-I’m doing everything I can!
-All right, okay.

43:10.546 --> 43:13.674
I wish I could believe you, Joe,
but you make it so hard.

43:13.758 --> 43:17.136
No. You make it so hard,
because you don’t want to believe in me.

43:17.220 --> 43:20.014
I said “believe,” not “believe in.”

43:20.098 --> 43:21.891
-[Joe] See?
-Now, listen.

43:21.974 --> 43:23.267
The onus is on you.

43:23.351 --> 43:26.187
What difference does it make
when you’re determined to judge me?

43:26.270 --> 43:28.481
Could I have some support here, please?

43:28.564 --> 43:30.399
Oh, no, wait, wait. Mom.

43:31.567 --> 43:33.361
Fuck it. I’ll be gone soon anyway.

43:33.444 --> 43:35.446
What’s that supposed to mean?

43:36.697 --> 43:40.868
This behavior is precisely
why you lost your family, Joseph!

Ahhh.

44:33.212 --> 44:34.463
Mmm.

44:35.214 --> 44:38.342
-Would you like another one?
-No, thanks.

44:42.346 --> 44:43.181
What?

44:44.515 --> 44:45.349
Thank you.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.561
For asking me here.

44:48.644 --> 44:52.398
I don’t usually-- And... [sighs]

44:53.190 --> 44:54.483
Feels nice.

44:55.610 --> 44:58.029
Like I said, I like you.

45:00.489 --> 45:01.616
Me too.

45:04.327 --> 45:07.288
So, Montreal.

45:08.497 --> 45:10.041
What prompted the move south?

45:11.292 --> 45:12.335
Polarity.

45:12.418 --> 45:14.086
[clears throat] Weather systems.

45:14.170 --> 45:17.214
-Why does anyone do anything?
-I don’t know.

45:20.843 --> 45:23.429
Do you ever feel like
you’re living in the wrong skin?

45:25.222 --> 45:26.974
Sometimes I’ll wake up
in the middle of the night

45:27.058 --> 45:30.061
and I’ll go to get a glass of water,

45:30.144 --> 45:34.649
and I’ll just catch myself in the mirror,
and I don’t recognize myself at all.

45:34.732 --> 45:38.903
It’s like someone else has come
into my bathroom and just stood there.

45:40.655 --> 45:42.531
Does that ever happen to you?

45:45.826 --> 45:46.869
Sure.

45:50.289 --> 45:51.332
Hmm.

46:43.676 --> 46:45.177
Okay. And you?

46:45.261 --> 46:46.637
Yes.

46:46.721 --> 46:47.930

47:37.688 --> 47:38.981
I like your place.

47:43.527 --> 47:44.862
It’s what I have.

47:45.738 --> 47:47.073
-Cheers.
-[clinking]

47:53.537 --> 47:54.622
Why me?

47:57.374 --> 47:58.584
’Cause you’re good.

48:17.978 --> 48:20.606
[Joe] I think everything happens
for a reason, you know?

48:22.650 --> 48:23.984
Like what?

48:24.068 --> 48:25.152
Meeting you.

48:26.112 --> 48:28.197
-[chuckles]
-No, really. I--

48:29.156 --> 48:31.867
I’ve been having kind of a hard time.

48:32.618 --> 48:33.953
Just alone, you know?

48:34.620 --> 48:37.623
Things... just f-feel different now.

48:39.917 --> 48:42.920
-Hmm.
-Hope that’s not weird to say.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.674
[sighs] Anyways, so, yeah.

48:48.634 --> 48:50.427
Do you have any other clients?

48:50.511 --> 48:51.929
Other than Manny, I mean.

48:52.012 --> 48:54.181
I noticed you had, I don’t know,
looked like, uh...

48:54.265 --> 48:56.559
-[sighs]
-...pharmaceuticals or something in there.

48:59.186 --> 49:02.606
The reason I ask is because,
before I moved back,

49:02.690 --> 49:04.900
one of the firms I was consulting for
had this guy--

49:04.984 --> 49:05.985
Oh, Joe.

49:06.569 --> 49:08.487
No, it’s true. He was-- Really--

49:08.571 --> 49:09.905
Really? “Consulting”?

49:10.698 --> 49:11.866
You were in jail.

49:14.827 --> 49:16.162
It was in the paper.

49:16.745 --> 49:18.747
Your picture was in the paper.

49:18.831 --> 49:22.001
“Slash Cop,” it said, which just is...

49:27.756 --> 49:29.133
What happened?

49:29.216 --> 49:31.051
[sighs] Didn’t you read it?

49:31.760 --> 49:32.845
I’m asking you.

49:35.097 --> 49:37.099
I was very drunk. Um--

49:38.642 --> 49:40.644
Coming home from a place downtown.

49:41.812 --> 49:44.982
Apparently I bumped into him, the lawyer.

49:46.525 --> 49:47.526
And, uh--

49:51.155 --> 49:53.490
There was a fight, and I hurt him. Badly.

49:54.033 --> 49:56.285
-It said you had a knife.
-I thought he was gonna--

49:56.368 --> 49:58.704
It was dark, and I-I-I, um--

50:04.251 --> 50:05.753
If you knew...

50:10.299 --> 50:15.054
Because I know what it means
to need a second chance.

50:16.430 --> 50:19.266
And I didn’t know you
when you did those things.

50:21.560 --> 50:23.062
I know you now.

50:57.513 --> 51:01.308
I was hoping I would’ve heard
some sort of “In Memoriam” item by now

51:01.392 --> 51:02.518
about our mutual patron.

51:02.601 --> 51:04.895

-Whoa.
-Yeah, exactly.

51:07.106 --> 51:08.315
I can’t get that close again.

51:08.399 --> 51:10.234
If anything other than cancer
happens to Manny,

51:10.317 --> 51:12.111
I’ll be the first one he comes after.

51:12.194 --> 51:13.445
Figure it out. [exhales]

51:13.529 --> 51:15.656
Put in some work
instead of gettin’ your dick wet.

51:15.739 --> 51:18.242
I was working. She’s the nurse there.

51:18.325 --> 51:20.786
-Oh. Good thinkin’.
-Yeah. Except that won’t work either.

51:20.869 --> 51:23.956
-Why not?
-It just... won’t.

51:24.957 --> 51:26.542
There’s no access. Trust me.

51:28.585 --> 51:32.589
[sighs] All that matters is that there
isn’t a case brought against you.

51:33.299 --> 51:35.926
Phil is the only one eager to throw bombs,

the Vasseys are good for business.

clip the mutant.

Just make it look right, is all.

I will not have dirty money in my house.

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:55.488
It’s not dirty money. It’s my money.

01:07:56.030 --> 01:08:00.702
Who keeps that much money in a bag
unless it’s dirty money?

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:02.912
You have no right to go through my stuff!

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:04.872
We have every right!

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:06.749
Where did it come from? Where?

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:09.168
What’s the difference?
I’m leaving! You get your wish!

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:11.754
My wish is to have my son back.

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:13.756
-All right--
-I don’t know who you are!

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.425
-[Joe’s dad] Take it easy, Joe.
-Mom.

01:08:16.216 --> 01:08:18.386
I’m going. Okay? I’m going.

01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:20.596
But I need that bag.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.932
-Mm-mmm.
-I am dead without it.

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:24.767
So where is it? Please.

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:26.102
Please.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:29.981
No. No!

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:33.901
No!

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.211
[Joe] What the fuck?

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:10.813
[sobs]

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:13.816
You...

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.527
have been in touch this whole time?

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:19.322
The best thing
that ever happened to those girls

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:21.573
was to get away from their father.

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:22.742
[shouts]

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:27.872
[Joe’s mom] Remember, you had everything
and you destroyed it all!

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:29.374
-[Joe] Fuck you!
-[Joe’s dad] Just stop!

01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:31.501
[Joe] You’ll never hate me
as much as I hate myself!

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.086
[Joe’s mom] Oh, no, you don’t!

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:36.673
You don’t get to turn this into
a little pity party!

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:38.591
This is beyond your little feelings!

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:40.385
[Joe] When did you ever care how I felt?

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:44.305
[Joe’s mom] That’s all I ever cared about!
And I don’t hate you!

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:46.390
I hate what you’ve done to this family!

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:48.267
-Where’s the fucking money?
-[gunshot]

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.519
[glass breaking]

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.188
[gagging]

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:55.525
-[rapid gunfire]
-[screaming]

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:06.035
[distorted] Joe! 911! Joe, call 911!

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:10.289
-[Joe’s mom] Oh!
-Call 911, Joe!

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:13.418
-[speaks indistinctly]
-[gagging, gasping]

01:10:15.294 --> 01:10:17.880
-Oh, Jesus Christ, Joe!
-Aaah!

01:10:31.519 --> 01:10:32.353
Dad?

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.314
Dad?

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:37.358
Who did it?

01:10:38.025 --> 01:10:39.444
[Joe sighs]

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:44.741
Junior Vassey or-or Dan Pleasant.
I don’t know.

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:46.659
Your friends.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:49.829
[Joe] Oh.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.917
You bring mayhem with you, Joe.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.102
[knocking]

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:20.985
I fucked up.

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:26.240
[water splashes]

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:02.735
[Joe] Then what happened was...

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:06.239
I got behind with my bookie.

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.993
It started slow, ya know,
couple of Sundays of bad luck.

01:12:12.119 --> 01:12:13.996
Next thing I know, I’m underwater.

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:18.543
I kept thinking, “Aw, I’ll sort this out.”

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:21.170
[sniffs] “I’ll dig out from this.

01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:22.255
My daughters...

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:26.843
when they look at me, when they look
at my face, they’ll forgive me.”

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:31.597
Me and another cop...

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:33.766
a guy named Dan...

01:12:35.893 --> 01:12:40.898
we did whatever Manny said,
and he said, “Do terrible things.”

01:12:42.316 --> 01:12:43.192
Now it--

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:45.778
It’s happening all over again.

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:51.909
He’s gonna talk about all that now,
Manny is, and when he does...

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:57.248
that prosecutor’s
gonna give me the death penalty.

01:12:57.331 --> 01:13:00.209
[sniffs]
Assuming Dan doesn’t kill me first.

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:01.502
You don’t know that.

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:05.298
You don’t.

01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:10.303
We’re not defined by our pasts.

01:13:12.013 --> 01:13:15.516
You’ve remade yourself.
You’ve chosen to be a good man.

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:19.937
It’s a choice. That’s all it is.

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:26.694
In prison, uh, there was a chaplain.

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:29.071
Chaplain Morris.

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:34.493
And he sat with me for--
for fuckin’ years.

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:39.999
I’m tellin’ ya, if someone tells you
for that long that you can be forgiven...

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:47.256
You’re the only one who made me feel
like maybe he was right.

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:51.552
He was.

01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:01.729
I need money to run.

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:14.200

[snorts]

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:26.707
-Let’s go.
-[Joe] Hey, guys.

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:02.034
[zipper zips]

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.202
[Joe] I’m gonna go.

01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:05.412
Big time.

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:08.165
But...

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:10.876
you’re gonna see the playroom first.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.963
Junior, you don’t have to do this. I--
I swear I’m gonna leave.

01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:16.340
What-Whatever Phil is gonna do
with your Dad had--

01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:17.967
My dad?

01:17:20.427 --> 01:17:23.389
My father... is dead.

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:26.976
He was a great man. A king.

01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:28.435
And...

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:31.730
Well, they’ll never be
another one like him, right, fellas?

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:33.983
-Fuck yeah.
-[thug] Hmm. [chuckles]

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:39.113
[stammers] Don’t, don’t! No!

01:17:39.196 --> 01:17:42.491
Your girlfriend isn’t
the most competent nurse I’ve ever seen.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:43.909
[screams]

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:48.455

01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:51.375
Jesus Christ, you sound like she did.
[laughs]

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:53.836
But don’t worry. You’ll see her again.

01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:55.754

01:17:55.838 --> 01:17:58.799

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:34.877
[Joe] Where is she?

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:38.130
Out there.

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:42.176
[thug] Let’s go. [speaks foreign language]

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:46.597
[Junior] We’re gonna go in there together,
you and me.

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:49.600
[Joe groans]

01:18:49.683 --> 01:18:52.770
We are gonna go down there
and work it all out.

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:54.897
[Junior] We got all day, don’t we?

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.523
There’s nothing to work out. Uh--

01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:58.734
I didn’t do anything. It wasn’t me.

01:18:58.817 --> 01:19:00.194
That’s not what she said.

01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:02.196
[Joe] We don’t have to do this.
It wasn’t me.

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:03.822
-All right, come on.
-[Joe] No. No!

Scotty, you hear me?

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:06.547
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:07.506
Good.

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:09.341
You’re gonna be fine.

-Getting you help.
-Yeah?

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:15.305
’Cause...

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:18.142
you were like a brother to Billy.

01:22:19.393 --> 01:22:21.186
That makes you like a brother to me,
right?

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:22.104
That’s right.

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:29.987
Except he didn’t fall
on any fucking train tracks, did he?

01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:32.656
Not the way they said.

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:38.245
You... put him there.

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:41.999
That’s crazy, Scotty. Just--

We’re almost there, okay?

01:22:46.253 --> 01:22:48.922

01:22:57.681 --> 01:22:59.391
I talked to Phil about it, you know?

01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:03.187
-He’s not such a bad guy.
-Did you--

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:08.567
Did you maybe take a shot at my house,
Scotty?

Yeah.

<i>Phil’s car.</i>

01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:36.363
[tires squealing]

01:24:44.288 --> 01:24:45.455
-<i>Bitch, I knew it!</i>
-[screams]

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:46.373
[gunshot]

01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:48.250
[gunshots]

01:24:57.801 --> 01:24:59.011
Motherfucker.

01:24:59.678 --> 01:25:01.013
[tires screeching, horn blaring]

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.647
[Dan] <i>Got into a smashup last night.</i>
<i>Went up in smoke.</i>

01:25:11.732 --> 01:25:13.650
<i>You did it. You’re free.</i>

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:17.738
<i>Now we’ll get started with the judge,</i>
<i>get your girls back.</i>

01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:21.575
<i>Yes, sir, a brand-new day, Joey.</i>
<i>A brand-new day.</i>

01:25:21.658 --> 01:25:22.659
[phone clicks]

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:36.024
[sighs]

01:26:36.108 --> 01:26:38.694
[footsteps approaching]

01:26:47.494 --> 01:26:48.495
How is she?

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:52.082
She’s gonna live.

01:26:58.630 --> 01:26:59.840
What are you doing?

01:27:00.257 --> 01:27:01.258
I’m leaving.

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:05.554
What are you doing with that?

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:08.432
-You want it?
-[scoffs]

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:11.059
[spits]

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:16.815
-What are you doing with it?
-I’m taking it to the girls.

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:19.401
-No, you’re not.
-I’m not trying to buy them.

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:21.987
Just gonna give it to ’em.

01:27:23.196 --> 01:27:24.197
Most of it.

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:28.326
[sighs]
See them once more, and then I’ll just--

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:29.411
No, you’re not.

01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:35.417
You are going nowhere near those girls.

01:27:36.168 --> 01:27:37.878
Money, no money, I don’t care.

01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:39.796
You will never be in proximity enough

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:44.134
that your damage and mayhem
ever touches them, not even for a second.

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:46.094
I promise this to you, Son.

01:27:46.636 --> 01:27:48.638
This will not happen if I am alive.

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:54.311
Bye, Dad.

01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:58.482
I’m... sorry for everything.

01:27:58.565 --> 01:27:59.858
No, you’re not listening.

01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:03.278
I said it will not happen.

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:05.363
I said no.

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:08.950
Stop me.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:24.508
[blade scrapes]

01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:25.592

01:28:26.384 --> 01:28:27.594

01:29:19.563 --> 01:29:21.565
[winces] Oh!

01:29:52.304 --> 01:29:54.806
[man singing in Spanish]

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:32.237
