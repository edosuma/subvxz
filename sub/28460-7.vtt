A Family Of Four</font>

00:09.737 --> 00:11.924
This is a really big moment,
all right?

00:12.012 --> 00:14.231
We've been waiting for this
moment for a long time, right?

00:14.318 --> 00:15.936
I mean, you're gonna
finally meet

00:16.024 --> 00:18.797
your baby sister
for the first time.

00:20.211 --> 00:21.469
You know,

00:21.643 --> 00:24.662
her name is Talia Collins Short,

00:24.750 --> 00:27.258
and she's gonna be
in your life forever.

00:27.688 --> 00:28.898
Oh, boy.

00:29.258 --> 00:31.178
And-and she's gonna
look up to you,

00:31.266 --> 00:32.858
and she's gonna want
to hold your hand,

00:32.945 --> 00:34.641
you know, even when you're 80.

00:34.758 --> 00:37.857
You'll be just two old ladies
who hold hands

00:37.945 --> 00:39.300
and watch sunsets together.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.084
Doesn't that sound nice?

00:41.171 --> 00:43.289
Can I push the buttons?

00:43.663 --> 00:45.812
Yeah, fine.
Go for it.

00:45.937 --> 00:47.633
Knock yourself out.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.422
Come on.

00:53.694 --> 00:55.928
- Hey, honey.
- Are you guys here?

00:56.016 --> 00:58.023
Oh, I can't wait
for the girls to meet.

00:58.111 --> 01:00.006
Yeah, I know.
Can you believe it?

01:00.094 --> 01:02.062
We're a family of four.

01:02.149 --> 01:04.569
Now we can each be one of our
kids' favorites.

01:04.727 --> 01:06.544
Well, that's not
necessarily true.

01:06.741 --> 01:08.284
- Well...
- Hey, did you put Lark

01:08.372 --> 01:09.504
in that special dress?

01:09.591 --> 01:11.854
Yep, and, uh, I've got the gift

01:11.941 --> 01:14.335
from her to the baby,
the gift from the baby to her,

01:14.422 --> 01:16.337
the gift from me to you
and nothing for me.

01:16.424 --> 01:18.078
So, everyone's taken care of.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.731
You're doing a great job, honey.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.440
Thanks. You know, I know they say

01:21.528 --> 01:23.474
going from one kid to two
is hard,

01:23.561 --> 01:26.434
but I'm gonna be honest,
so far, so good.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.218
I'll see you in a second.

01:32.353 --> 01:33.702
No, Lark! No!

01:33.789 --> 01:35.965
Lark! No.

01:36.052 --> 01:37.967
Come on.

01:45.826 --> 01:47.524
Do you know where
the burn unit is?

01:47.612 --> 01:49.109
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.

01:49.383 --> 01:50.698
Jerk.

01:51.913 --> 01:53.748
Lark! Lark!

01:55.854 --> 01:59.626
That's not good.

01:59.939 --> 02:01.773
Officer. Officer,
I-I lost my kid.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.167
She's, uh, four years old,
she has short brown hair,

02:04.254 --> 02:06.474
uh, she's got a big heart
and-and her favorite color

02:06.561 --> 02:07.736
is-is every color.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.954
- Have you tried the morgue?
- Oh, God.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.141
What? It's next
to the McDonald's.

02:11.228 --> 02:12.262
All the kids end up there.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.873
Well, why didn't
you just say McDonald's?

02:18.007 --> 02:19.530
Lark! Lark!

02:19.617 --> 02:21.367
Lark! Lark!

02:21.663 --> 02:23.752
Oh, no.

02:23.839 --> 02:26.189
Uh, hey, honey.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.782
Hey, where are you guys?

02:27.870 --> 02:30.192
Uh, w-we just got turned around
a little bit.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.032
Yeah. You know,
hospitals are like casinos.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.463
They-they just don't want you
to leave.

02:34.810 --> 02:36.405
That's literally
the exact opposite

02:36.493 --> 02:38.111
of what a hospital wants.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.690
Hey, honey, will you
put Lark on the phone?

02:39.777 --> 02:41.475
I just want to prepare her
for this.

02:41.606 --> 02:44.952
Lark can't talk right now.
Um, she has got, uh,

02:45.040 --> 02:46.557
some gumballs in her mouth.

02:46.644 --> 02:48.751
Yeah. S-She's probably got,
like, 20 in there.

02:48.839 --> 02:50.145
What? Is that safe?

02:51.181 --> 02:52.955
Well, you know,
this is a hospital, Jen.

02:53.042 --> 02:55.884
Uh, there's help
around every corner.

02:56.088 --> 02:59.396
Will somebody please help me?

02:59.483 --> 03:00.931
Lark?

03:04.370 --> 03:06.329
Hello? Hello?

03:06.534 --> 03:08.534
I need some help here!

03:08.971 --> 03:10.233
Congratulations.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.868
- Oh.
- What's the matter?

03:11.956 --> 03:13.322
I lost Lark.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.412
Honey, listen, just take
a breath, okay?

03:15.499 --> 03:17.371
It's no big deal.
Kids run off, all right?

03:17.458 --> 03:19.024
How long has she been gone?

03:19.111 --> 03:20.765
I don't know.
Maybe three minutes?

03:20.852 --> 03:23.333
Three minutes? Oh, my gosh!

03:23.420 --> 03:25.205
Greg, why are you standing here?
I got this!

03:25.292 --> 03:28.556
You go, run! Why are you not
looking for her? Call her name!

03:28.643 --> 03:30.993
Lark? Oh...

03:31.257 --> 03:33.390
Oh, sorry.

03:33.478 --> 03:36.085
Whoa. Delicious. Uh, whoa, uhp.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.211
Oh! Lark!

03:43.397 --> 03:45.057
Lark!

03:45.759 --> 03:47.760
I have the flu.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.074

03:58.347 --> 04:02.154
I heard somebody was
in a grizzly accident.

04:09.524 --> 04:12.962
Excuse me.
H-Have you seen a little girl?

04:13.841 --> 04:15.190
Hi, Daddy.

04:15.301 --> 04:17.951
- Lark! Lark!
- Oh!

04:18.039 --> 04:20.476
Oh. You're here. You're here.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.479
Oh, wow. Thank you so much.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.525
Oh. Are you okay?

04:24.726 --> 04:29.117
I saw a sleeping man
with a price tag on his toe.

04:29.687 --> 04:31.508
You didn't try
to wake him up, did you?

04:31.596 --> 04:32.989
No.

04:33.084 --> 04:34.825
All right.

04:35.231 --> 04:36.910
Here we are.

04:37.386 --> 04:39.086
Finally. I was getting worried.

04:39.174 --> 04:40.610
Hi, sweetie.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.766
Mm. Oh.

04:42.911 --> 04:46.219
So, someone has been
asking to meet you.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.635
Should we go over?

04:47.722 --> 04:49.000
Here.

04:50.922 --> 04:52.883
She's so cute.

04:55.730 --> 04:57.875
I love you, Talia.

04:58.758 --> 05:00.398
It's just how I pictured it.

05:00.486 --> 05:04.078
See, honey?
I told you, we got this.

05:04.173 --> 05:05.566
Yeah, we do.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.437
Oh!

05:07.524 --> 05:09.156
Oh, thank God.
You found her.

05:09.281 --> 05:11.810
Oh, Lark. I was worried

05:11.898 --> 05:14.227
that we'd lost
you forever. Oh...

05:14.710 --> 05:16.406
Did you lose Lark?

05:16.494 --> 05:20.068
No.

05:20.156 --> 05:22.235
Code pink. Missing child.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.789
Answers to the name of Lark.

05:26.587 --> 05:28.371
I never wanted to be
one of these parents,

05:28.458 --> 05:30.445
but I think we
should get a leash.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.031
<font color=#FFFF00>Story Two:
New Math</font>

05:37.211 --> 05:38.935
Hey, Sophia,
when are you gonna come join

05:39.023 --> 05:41.031
the rest of the family
for dinner?

05:41.230 --> 05:43.286
Oh, you have that constipated
look on your face.

05:43.374 --> 05:44.227
You need a banana?

05:44.315 --> 05:47.023
No. It's my math homework.

05:47.111 --> 05:48.258
It's impossible.

05:48.346 --> 05:49.477
I can't do it.

05:49.565 --> 05:51.062
Now I know
why people skateboard.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.734
Oh, sweetie, listen,
it's okay. I can help you.

05:53.970 --> 05:57.148
Hey. Can I go to a silent rave
with Jenna tonight?

05:57.236 --> 05:59.016
Absolutely not.
It's a school night.

05:59.141 --> 06:02.789
Fine. I'll just stay in
and send pictures of my butt

06:02.861 --> 06:03.952
to every boy in school.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.781
Yeah, okay, sweetie,
have a good time.

06:05.964 --> 06:09.016
All right, doing a little math.
Okay, so we've got...

06:09.281 --> 06:10.283
W-Where are the numbers?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.031
Where are the plus signs?
What is this?

06:12.172 --> 06:13.935
- This is the prompt.
- Mm-hmm.

06:14.023 --> 06:15.273
And these are the unit cubes.

06:15.461 --> 06:17.028
I don't...

06:17.484 --> 06:18.481
Mom, it's okay.

06:18.569 --> 06:20.592
I'll just copy off
Beverly in the morning.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.344
I'm pretty sure
she's in love with me.

06:22.432 --> 06:24.320
Okay, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:24.844 --> 06:28.578
I am four credits shy
of a college degree.

06:31.969 --> 06:33.805
Were those four credits
for math?

06:34.594 --> 06:36.047
Ugh.

06:39.208 --> 06:41.383
Mom, I'm hungry.

06:41.479 --> 06:44.047
- You'll eat once we get this.
- Get what?

06:44.156 --> 06:46.176
Your daughter's stupid homework.

06:46.264 --> 06:47.962
Ooh, I'm good
at homework.

06:48.265 --> 06:49.493
What is this?

06:49.581 --> 06:51.844
- Math.
- I disagree.

06:52.055 --> 06:53.211
I'll just google it.

06:53.306 --> 06:55.588
How are you gonna google
a bunch of grids on a page?

06:55.676 --> 06:57.504
Okay, wait, wait, wait,
listen, we are not gonna

06:57.591 --> 06:59.288
pull the answers
off the Internet, okay.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.517
'Cause it's not
gonna be the day

07:00.604 --> 07:03.520
that our daughter's homework
is too difficult for us.

07:03.771 --> 07:06.121
You're a doctor.
I'm a doctor's wife.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.242
We can handle a little bit
of middle school math.

07:08.330 --> 07:10.516
- Come on.
- All right, let me get at this thing.

07:10.604 --> 07:13.906
I'm gonna climb up in here
and see what we got. Okay.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.320
I don't know, I give up.
This is that day.

07:18.581 --> 07:20.430
- Ooh, Colleen. Hey.
- Yeah?

07:20.518 --> 07:21.432
Hi.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.696
Hey, we're having
a little trouble

07:22.783 --> 07:23.875
with some math in here.

07:23.963 --> 07:26.000
- Can you help us?
- Of course.

07:26.088 --> 07:27.766
Oh, great.
Can you go get Jen?

07:27.943 --> 07:29.617
Thank you.

07:31.375 --> 07:33.367
- 18.
- That's the answer?

07:33.455 --> 07:35.707
No, that's how many years
it's been since I've done math.

07:35.795 --> 07:36.826
Ugh!

07:36.914 --> 07:39.029
Come on, Jen,
you're a lawyer.

07:39.117 --> 07:40.460
You go to an office.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.195
Those are facts
about my job, yes.

07:43.403 --> 07:44.926
Do you want me to sue the school

07:45.029 --> 07:47.164
- for giving her homework?
- Can you do that?

07:47.252 --> 07:50.023
The teacher did say something
about a sequence pattern...

07:50.111 --> 07:51.914
You know what, honey,
let the grown-ups think.

07:52.002 --> 07:53.086
Okay?

07:53.174 --> 07:56.141
Look, I'm sure that
it's secretly easy.

07:56.229 --> 07:57.680
We just don't know
what it's asking

07:57.768 --> 08:01.467
or what it's about or,
you know, what it is.

08:01.674 --> 08:03.732
Why don't we ask Sam?
Didn't she just do this

08:03.820 --> 08:04.701
a few years ago?

08:04.788 --> 08:07.487
Because I am not gonna
ask a 16-year-old

08:07.574 --> 08:09.097
to help me with this homework.

08:09.184 --> 08:10.790
I can't believe you
don't have any faith in us.

08:10.877 --> 08:12.444
Heather, we are
too old for math.

08:12.532 --> 08:14.229
All right, we're not too old.

08:14.460 --> 08:15.896
What is nine times seven?

08:16.477 --> 08:19.305
- See, we're too old for math.
- It's sixty...

08:19.398 --> 08:21.196
Hey, nobody asked you
to do math, Sophia.

08:21.566 --> 08:23.578
Okay, I happen to know a nerd
in this family

08:23.666 --> 08:26.364
who is, like, legitimately
good at this kind of stuff.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.769
- Oh, Colleen?
- Yeah?

08:28.977 --> 08:30.998
Will you get Greg for me?

08:31.086 --> 08:32.381
Mm-hmm.

08:33.125 --> 08:36.719
Mm-hmm. Yep. Yep.

08:36.893 --> 08:38.727
You gotta figure that out.
That's math.

08:38.830 --> 08:40.140
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, come on.

08:40.227 --> 08:41.679
You dumb, lying nerd.

08:41.768 --> 08:43.857
I can't believe you guys
didn't ask me for help.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.525
"No, Colleen can't do numbers."

08:45.612 --> 08:47.657
Well, joke's on you.

08:47.744 --> 08:50.312
Wait, are you saying
that you understand unit cubes?

08:50.547 --> 08:52.706
Unit what?
No. Sorry.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.185
I got confused for a second.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.384
You know what,
I just remembered,

08:55.471 --> 08:57.055
I've got some
math stuff at home,

08:57.143 --> 08:59.953
- so I'm gonna run and get it.
- Mm. -Okay.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.237
She's not coming back, is she?

09:02.324 --> 09:03.531
Nope.

09:03.682 --> 09:05.477
Hey, did you guys
figure it out?

09:05.565 --> 09:08.176
Yeah, Sophia, you should just do
what I used to do in school.

09:08.374 --> 09:10.679
Flirt with the teacher,
don't turn in your homework,

09:10.767 --> 09:12.421
and then turn in the teacher.

09:12.508 --> 09:13.683
Heather, go get Sam.

09:13.770 --> 09:16.164
No. Come on, how is it that
a group of educated adults

09:16.251 --> 09:18.035
- can't figure this out?
- Because we can't.

09:18.122 --> 09:19.036
It's too hard.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.906
Oh, it is not!

09:22.264 --> 09:24.658
I must've just
forgotten the easy stuff.

09:25.679 --> 09:29.125
Okay, nine goes
in the second box.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.742
27 goes over here.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.354
And the output is...

09:32.653 --> 09:34.829
- Uh, seven and a half?
- Yep.

09:34.955 --> 09:36.312
Ooh, I am turned on.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.555
- I never made it with a nerd before.
- Oh...

09:38.643 --> 09:41.429
Yep, 7.5. That's what
I came up with.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.192
That's a really pretty
pattern on the page.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.802
- Mm.
- Mom, you're the best.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.512
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

09:47.748 --> 09:49.663
I love you seven
and a half times more.

09:51.329 --> 09:52.777
Peach crumble
in the dining room.

09:52.864 --> 09:56.075
All right, go get some dessert,
sweetie, you deserve it.

09:56.395 --> 09:59.163
Oh, look at that.

09:59.504 --> 10:00.513
Mom.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.737
Yeah?

10:01.825 --> 10:03.087
Oh, I know.

10:03.175 --> 10:07.509
I see you. Okay, listen,
this will cover pizza

10:07.597 --> 10:09.487
and what I hope is a soda.

10:09.575 --> 10:11.969
And how much for
doing your homework?

10:12.307 --> 10:16.093
Go. Take your freaky outfit
and go.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.480
Hey, hey!

10:17.598 --> 10:19.118
Love you.

10:22.127 --> 10:24.258
<font color=#FFFF00>Story Three:
Art Rocks</font>

10:25.363 --> 10:27.110
Hey, uh, have you seen Mom?

10:27.198 --> 10:29.006
I need her to take Lucas
to art class.

10:29.094 --> 10:30.281
I got a-a work emergency.

10:30.368 --> 10:31.461
Emergency?

10:31.549 --> 10:33.641
I thought you were
a graphic dealer.

10:33.729 --> 10:35.035
I'm a graphic designer.

10:35.123 --> 10:37.212
And, yeah, there's an emergency.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.719
They wanted the logo
in Helvetica,

10:38.807 --> 10:40.897
we made it in Arial, so this is
an all-hands-on-deck

10:40.985 --> 10:43.094
- sort of situation.
- You know, in my day,

10:43.182 --> 10:45.022
a work emergency was, uh,

10:45.110 --> 10:48.149
nearly 500 passengers
plummeting to their death.

10:48.237 --> 10:50.239
Dad, I'm not looking
for perspective, okay.

10:50.327 --> 10:52.407
I'm looking for a ride
for Lucas to art class.

10:52.495 --> 10:55.014
What's the big deal?
Just tell him to skip it.

10:55.102 --> 10:58.438
No. He really enjoys it,
and I'm trying to be a father

10:58.526 --> 11:00.920
who encourages him,
unlike, you know, you,

11:01.008 --> 11:03.713
who referred to art class
as fart class.

11:04.174 --> 11:05.243
I said that?

11:05.331 --> 11:07.290
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.
- Amazing.

11:07.378 --> 11:09.400
It was hilarious, especially
when you made me skip it

11:09.487 --> 11:10.524
to go to golf lessons.

11:10.612 --> 11:12.186
Well, it's incredible
you remember that.

11:12.274 --> 11:13.673
- I forgot the whole thing.
- Yeah.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.493
Well, that's how
trauma works, Dad.

11:15.672 --> 11:17.368
Well, tell that to Phil Donahue.

11:17.456 --> 11:18.938
Ah, great.
Thank you.

11:19.026 --> 11:22.243
Okay, I'll-I'll take the kid
to art class.

11:22.352 --> 11:23.378
Really?

11:23.465 --> 11:24.743
Yeah, it'll give me a chance

11:24.831 --> 11:26.563
to get to know
my new grandson.

11:26.651 --> 11:28.861
Yeah, okay.
I think he'd really like that.

11:29.094 --> 11:30.649
Great, huh?

11:31.868 --> 11:32.878
Dad?

11:32.996 --> 11:34.258
Hmm?

11:34.579 --> 11:36.125
Oh, you mean now?

11:39.829 --> 11:42.919
Well, I got to say I'm sorry
I ever doubted you, Dad.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.985
Lucas had a great time
hanging out with his Pop-Pop.

11:46.102 --> 11:48.751
In fact, here's a little
something to say thank you.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.469
Well, how about that.

11:50.564 --> 11:53.047
I swear, you art hasn't
gotten any better.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.329
That's from Lucas.

11:54.492 --> 11:56.279
He's really advanced,
don't you think?

11:56.453 --> 11:58.717
Well, all I see is
a pile of brown rocks,

11:58.805 --> 12:01.844
but you know, I'll put it
up here in the art gallery.

12:01.932 --> 12:03.945
Oh, wow, that's awesome.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.406
I never made the fridge.

12:05.494 --> 12:06.789
Well, you got to earn it.

12:06.877 --> 12:10.203
I mean, this took Heather
six wine and design classes.

12:10.291 --> 12:13.425
Man, it's so great that he's
invested in something so young.

12:13.529 --> 12:15.249
Maybe I should double up
on his art classes.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.606
Why don't I keep taking him?

12:17.693 --> 12:19.216
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

12:19.303 --> 12:21.217
I've got to say,
I'm kind of blown away, Dad.

12:21.305 --> 12:23.014
It's cool that you want to be
a part of his life.

12:23.101 --> 12:25.614
Well, I-I guess
it's just because

12:25.701 --> 12:27.834
Lucas is my first grandson.

12:28.336 --> 12:31.141
But I'm your first grandson.

12:31.734 --> 12:33.115
No, I'm sure that
he just means

12:33.203 --> 12:36.601
his first grandson with a...
you know, with a dream.

12:36.749 --> 12:39.101
But I had a band for years,

12:39.189 --> 12:41.977
and no one in this family
ever came to see me play.

12:42.065 --> 12:44.498
Oh, buddy,
I'll come see you play.

12:44.586 --> 12:45.867
When's your next gig?

12:46.047 --> 12:47.279
I quit.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.302
Well, that's why
I didn't support you.

12:49.390 --> 12:51.205
You're a quitter.

12:52.578 --> 12:54.715
- Hello?
- Hi, sweetie.

12:54.803 --> 12:57.197
- Hi.
- Your father and Lucas are still out.

12:57.285 --> 12:59.200
Oh, cool. Have you
seen his artwork?

12:59.294 --> 13:01.731
Yeah, I saw the rocks
on the fridge.

13:01.833 --> 13:04.482
Anything to cover up
Heather's drunken art.

13:05.375 --> 13:07.631
Isn't it so nice to see
Dad supporting Lucas

13:07.719 --> 13:09.649
in something that he loves.
I mean, this is coming from the man

13:09.736 --> 13:11.703
who literally told me
to quit art.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.375
Well, to be fair, dear,

13:13.463 --> 13:15.944
you were 36 and living
in our garage.

13:16.297 --> 13:17.797
Yeah.

13:18.890 --> 13:21.062
What are Lucas' art supplies
still doing here?

13:21.344 --> 13:23.803
Why would they need art
supplies on the golf course?

13:24.195 --> 13:26.414
Why would they need
a golf course?

13:26.577 --> 13:29.750
Because it's embarrassing
to drink at home at 11:00 a.m.?

13:30.891 --> 13:32.675
Damn it.

13:36.523 --> 13:39.508
Wow. Really thought
you had changed, Dad.

13:39.633 --> 13:40.733
I thought you were
gonna support Lucas

13:40.820 --> 13:42.386
in a way
that you never supported me.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.154
- Oh, geez. I can explain.
- No, no, no.

13:44.242 --> 13:45.639
You don't have to.
I think that we all know

13:45.726 --> 13:46.695
what's happening here.

13:46.782 --> 13:50.664
Look. This one is igneous, see?

13:52.578 --> 13:53.883
What's happening here?

13:53.971 --> 13:55.162
Well, he likes rocks.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.865
That's why we skipped fart class

13:56.953 --> 13:58.838
and came here.
He hates art.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.404
What? That's not true.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.319
Who hates art
and only loves rocks?

14:02.663 --> 14:04.202
I love you, I love you.

14:05.328 --> 14:08.673
What's worse is I think that's
an old doody from a goose.

14:08.945 --> 14:11.851
He doesn't like art?
Why didn't he tell me that?

14:11.959 --> 14:15.250
'Cause his dad is pushing him
to be something he wasn't.

14:15.781 --> 14:17.508
I made the same mistake
you did.

14:17.595 --> 14:21.121
Well, you'll do better on the
next kid, if you can afford one.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.812
Thanks, Dad. Or...

14:24.647 --> 14:26.844
I could just support my son
no matter what he likes.

14:26.932 --> 14:30.498
I love this one, I love
this one, I love this one.

14:30.586 --> 14:32.131
I guess I could, too.

14:32.531 --> 14:35.656
You want to take
in a quick nine?

14:36.351 --> 14:37.914
No, I hate golf.

14:38.265 --> 14:41.228
Well, then,
we'll do it your way.

14:42.838 --> 14:45.560
Okay, I really
want to see definition

14:45.648 --> 14:47.025
in those rose petals.

14:47.113 --> 14:48.592
Thanks for coming
with me, Dad.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.158
Oh.

14:50.454 --> 14:54.119
I can see why Heather likes
this wine-ing and designing.

14:57.766 --> 15:00.682
Excuse me.
You can't have alcohol here.

15:00.986 --> 15:03.337
Oh. Heather?

15:03.459 --> 15:04.585
Yeah?

15:04.673 --> 15:06.457
I thought this
was the whole point.

15:06.706 --> 15:09.591
Oh. No, Dad. You have to put it
in a water bottle

15:09.679 --> 15:11.436
so no one knows you're drinking.

15:11.524 --> 15:12.874
Oh...

15:17.837 --> 15:19.733
<font color=#FFFF00>Story Four:
Hostile Makeover</font>

15:20.499 --> 15:22.355
Thank you for coming
over for tea.

15:22.443 --> 15:25.272
Sorry I was all out,
but I microwaved some Snapple.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.546
Mm. Mm-hmm.

15:28.231 --> 15:30.718
Hot strawberry kiwi.

15:30.806 --> 15:32.343
So, now that we have Lucas,

15:32.453 --> 15:34.249
and Jen and Greg
have their new baby,

15:34.358 --> 15:37.023
I was thinking it's time
that we take a family photo.

15:37.299 --> 15:38.169
Ooh.

15:38.257 --> 15:40.692
- Family photo. No, no.
- Mm-hmm.

15:40.780 --> 15:42.677
We don't want more things

15:42.765 --> 15:44.429
for Facebook to sell
to the Russians.

15:44.595 --> 15:45.648
- Oh.
- We don't want that.

15:45.735 --> 15:48.647
You know what? I think I have
some tea bags in my purse.

15:48.854 --> 15:51.630
Not that this isn't delicious.

15:51.718 --> 15:52.747
Okay.

15:52.835 --> 15:53.905
I'll be right back.

15:53.993 --> 15:55.356
Okay, just so you know,

15:55.444 --> 15:58.554
my mom has never been
in a single family photo.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.632
She runs every time
she sees a camera.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.765
Yeah, that's why nobody can ever
catch her on film.

16:02.853 --> 16:04.983
I mean, we have gotten
a couple blurs of her, like,

16:05.071 --> 16:06.499
loping through the kitchen.

16:06.587 --> 16:09.835
She's basically the Bigfoot
of suburban therapists.

16:10.116 --> 16:13.044
Okay, well,
I am gonna convince her

16:13.132 --> 16:14.343
to be in the family photo.

16:14.781 --> 16:15.972
Okay.

16:16.241 --> 16:18.757
- You're so cute. I love it.
- You go do that.

16:19.022 --> 16:23.243
Yeah, listen, she wouldn't even
take one for Lark's christening.

16:23.601 --> 16:25.201
My daughter was christened?

16:25.468 --> 16:28.265
Oh, yeah. You were on
a work trip in Houston.

16:32.249 --> 16:35.211
Joan, I really want you
in the family photo.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.718
It's not complete without you.

16:36.806 --> 16:39.214
Oh, thank you, dear,
but it's a hard pass.

16:39.302 --> 16:42.288
I-I really am miserable
getting photographed.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.694
But you're so beautiful.

16:43.782 --> 16:45.436
Why do you hate
the camera so much?

16:45.524 --> 16:47.962
I-I don't hate it, it hates me.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.486
In fourth grade,

16:49.574 --> 16:51.225
my smile was so pained

16:51.313 --> 16:53.598
in-in the class photo
that they called in

16:53.686 --> 16:56.608
a special investigator
to question all the teachers.

16:56.696 --> 16:58.216
Well, the camera
doesn't hate you,

16:58.304 --> 17:00.062
it just needs
to get to know you.

17:00.265 --> 17:02.929
So allow me to make
the introduction.

17:03.084 --> 17:04.694
Are you gonna break into song?

17:04.782 --> 17:07.153
Nope, I'm gonna break
into my makeup kit.

17:07.241 --> 17:08.997
Because if you're just upset
about the way

17:09.085 --> 17:11.030
you look in photos,
I can fix that.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.902
No, honey. I-I'm not much
of a makeup person.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.382
You know, where I grew up,

17:15.469 --> 17:18.286
the only person that wore makeup
was the butcher's wife,

17:18.374 --> 17:20.655
and she wasn't somebody
you wanted to emulate.

17:20.742 --> 17:22.512
Joan, trust me. In high school,

17:22.601 --> 17:23.955
I worked
at the cosmetics counter,

17:24.042 --> 17:27.030
and I helped fix a ton
of weird-looking freaks.

17:27.124 --> 17:28.413
Not that you're one of them.

17:28.501 --> 17:30.286
I just don't think
makeup's the answer.

17:30.374 --> 17:32.007
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

17:32.095 --> 17:33.653
Can you tell
which eyebrow I lost

17:33.741 --> 17:35.231
in a sorority hazing incident?

17:35.319 --> 17:37.404
Right. No, left.

17:37.616 --> 17:39.390
No. No, r-the right.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.373
- Both.
- Oh, are you good.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.115
Thank you.

17:46.658 --> 17:48.892
I'm so impressed
you got Joan on board.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.983
Yeah. How did you do that?
Did you get her drunk?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.843
Ooh, was it pills?

17:52.982 --> 17:55.106
No. I just worked
my makeup magic

17:55.194 --> 17:56.466
and helped her feel comfortable.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.723
A little blending,
a little contouring,

17:58.811 --> 17:59.825
a little defining.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.123
In fact, if I had more time,

18:01.210 --> 18:03.772
I could make both of your eyes
look the same size,

18:03.890 --> 18:06.116
and I could give you
an upper lip.

18:06.610 --> 18:07.882
Excuse me.

18:07.970 --> 18:10.358
I think that your lips
are perfect.

18:10.491 --> 18:12.004
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.136
You... Okay.

18:14.223 --> 18:15.355
Okay.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.096
There she is.

18:29.132 --> 18:31.239
Did I just scream?
Because I wanted to.

18:31.397 --> 18:35.483
Wow, Mom. Look at
all your features.

18:36.256 --> 18:39.241
Okay. It's like an eclipse,
don't look directly at it.

18:39.483 --> 18:40.902
I can't look at Joan's face,

18:40.989 --> 18:42.251
I can't look at
Colleen's cleavage.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.585
- Where am I supposed to look?
- Okay.

18:44.673 --> 18:46.184
You look hot, Joanie.

18:46.340 --> 18:48.377
You look like
when, uh, Bugs Bunny

18:48.465 --> 18:50.955
tried to get that hunter
to make love to him.

18:51.042 --> 18:54.333
It's so much. I feel like
the local news anchor.

18:54.421 --> 18:56.301
No, no. You're the weather girl.

18:56.389 --> 18:58.409
Do I want to be
the weather girl?

18:58.497 --> 19:00.226
Okay, everyone. Let's do this.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.010
Mom-Mom, let me help you down.

19:02.097 --> 19:04.360
It looks like it might be hard
to see with those lashes.

19:04.447 --> 19:07.440
Well, honey,
the weight is the actual impediment.

19:07.528 --> 19:08.956
- Mm.
- When I close my eyes,

19:09.044 --> 19:10.067
I feel like I don't have

19:10.155 --> 19:11.699
the strength to open them.

19:11.787 --> 19:12.962
Okay.

19:13.050 --> 19:14.567
What did you do to my mother?

19:14.655 --> 19:16.950
Assuming that my mother
is underneath all of that.

19:17.038 --> 19:18.920
I know I might have gone
a little overboard,

19:19.008 --> 19:20.703
but she's here
and she's gonna be in the photo,

19:20.790 --> 19:22.218
which is more than any of
you have ever done,

19:22.305 --> 19:23.636
- so...
- Oh. Eh...

19:23.724 --> 19:24.879
Oh, dear.

19:24.967 --> 19:26.787
Ah, front and center.

19:27.037 --> 19:29.856
Right in the middle.
All the eyes are on me. Oh.

19:30.030 --> 19:33.172
Okay, Lark, so you're gonna stay
right in front of Mom-Mom, okay?

19:33.964 --> 19:36.053
That lady is scary.

19:37.289 --> 19:38.551
No way.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.397
- I'll get her.
- I got it, I got it.

19:41.484 --> 19:44.270
Oh, I'm so sorry, I just
don't feel like myself.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.359
I-I can't do this.

19:49.362 --> 19:50.885
Guys, I can fix this.

19:50.972 --> 19:53.022
Yeah. I don't think
the answer's in there.

19:53.163 --> 19:56.108
But what do I know?
I have no upper lip.

20:01.733 --> 20:04.059
I'm so sorry about
the other day, Joan.

20:04.147 --> 20:05.334
Don't be silly, sweetie.

20:05.421 --> 20:08.859
I just feel so badly that you
didn't get a family photo.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.557
Oh, it's okay.
We'll get it someday.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.080
Oh, you look nice.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.908
Here, why don't you
hold the baby?

20:13.995 --> 20:15.649
Oh, thank you, honey.

20:15.736 --> 20:19.218
She especially loves it when
you look up and say cheese.

20:19.405 --> 20:21.084
Cheese.

20:21.855 --> 20:24.451
Oh, you sons of bitches.
