WEBVTT

00:07.298 --> 00:10.091
I wish we were doing
a big party for Halloween again.

00:10.091 --> 00:12.343
I scared
so many boys last year,

00:12.343 --> 00:14.095
they wouldn't even look me
in the eye.

00:14.095 --> 00:16.347
I just walked around
school like, "What?"

00:19.100 --> 00:23.104
Sorry, sweets,
we couldn't top last year
so we decided to take a break.

00:23.104 --> 00:26.197
But feel free to keep scaring
those boys away

00:26.197 --> 00:28.199
until you have a nice,
solid career,

00:28.199 --> 00:30.911
and you know you can
take care of yourself.

00:30.911 --> 00:33.154
At least
if it's less scary,

00:33.154 --> 00:34.995
Mom won't get sick
on the carpet this year.

00:34.995 --> 00:38.119
It was late and someone left
a vampire dummy on the couch.

00:38.119 --> 00:41.082
I suffer from fear puke.
It's a very real problem.

00:41.082 --> 00:44.295
I know it's real.
I posted this video
of it online.

00:44.295 --> 00:46.757
Aah!
Vampire!

00:46.757 --> 00:48.089
( throwing up )

00:49.670 --> 00:50.931
Sorry, Bennett.

00:52.763 --> 00:53.974
Five hundred thousand hits.

00:53.974 --> 00:55.306
My man.

00:58.349 --> 01:01.182
You know, you're not just
laughing at my fear puke,

01:01.182 --> 01:04.395
you're laughing
at the entire FP community.

01:04.395 --> 01:07.148
We are doctors,
lawyers and scientists,

01:07.148 --> 01:09.450
who all smell like
yesterday's lunch.

01:11.192 --> 01:12.743
So, kids, any ideas on

01:12.743 --> 01:14.155
what we should do
with this big boy?

01:14.155 --> 01:15.406
Ooh, I know.

01:15.406 --> 01:17.408
Let's carve a Mommy Pumpkin!

01:24.875 --> 01:26.207
Oh, look, it's Mom.

01:28.259 --> 01:29.970
STAN: I've got to admit,

01:29.970 --> 01:32.263
my favorite part
of Halloween is getting scared.

01:32.263 --> 01:34.765
The rush of adrenaline
and then the calm,

01:34.765 --> 01:36.387
happy moment
when you realize

01:36.387 --> 01:38.219
everything is going to be fine.

01:38.219 --> 01:40.221
Right, Robert?

01:40.221 --> 01:42.143
Robert? Robert?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.566
( shrieks )

01:45.566 --> 01:47.568
Robert, you scared me.

01:47.568 --> 01:49.900
No, I will not look
into your eyes.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.071
No, I will not--

01:51.071 --> 01:53.614
Yes, master.

02:12.463 --> 02:14.094
Oh, come on, Avery.

02:14.094 --> 02:15.926
Why can't I just watch this
Halloween movie

02:15.926 --> 02:17.097
while you guys eat dinner?

02:17.097 --> 02:19.099
'Cause you yell at the screen.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.313
You haven't been careful
enough lately

02:22.313 --> 02:24.064
hiding that you can talk.

02:24.064 --> 02:26.146
Mom almost caught you
just the other day.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.689
Yes, I do chase squirrels,
I'm just saying

02:28.689 --> 02:30.531
it doesn't define who I am.

02:30.531 --> 02:32.233
You might as well
call me a tail-nibbler.

02:34.114 --> 02:35.826
I meant that rhetorically.

02:38.489 --> 02:40.451
Hello? Is anyone there?

02:40.451 --> 02:42.203
STAN: Just a dog chewing
a monkey.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.124
Move along.

02:44.124 --> 02:46.457
Not that you don't have
this coming, Robert.

02:48.669 --> 02:52.172
I promise, I'll use headphones
and I won't talk at all.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.215
Okay, fine, that'll work.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.136
Thanks, Avery.

02:56.136 --> 02:58.219
It's tough to find a movie
for the talking dog audience.

02:58.219 --> 03:01.302
Isn't it the same audience
as boys aged 6 to 11?

03:01.302 --> 03:04.064
And Tyler?

03:04.064 --> 03:05.726
True.
We like scary movies

03:05.726 --> 03:08.609
and the old
Kung Fu Fart Chimps trilogy.

03:08.609 --> 03:10.150
Hai-ya!

03:10.150 --> 03:13.023
"Thank goodness the Kung Fu
Fart Chimps are here.

03:13.023 --> 03:15.236
Oh, open a window."

03:17.117 --> 03:20.200
And somehow, Forrest Gump
got the Oscar that year.

03:23.824 --> 03:25.786
So, Avery,
hope you're not disappointed

03:25.786 --> 03:27.207
that we aren't making as big

03:27.207 --> 03:29.129
a deal out of
Halloween this year.

03:29.129 --> 03:30.170
Not at all.

03:30.170 --> 03:31.752
I could use a year off.

03:31.752 --> 03:33.754
All the pressure last year,
I almost fell apart.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.301
Got you guys.

03:40.301 --> 03:43.013
My year off begins now.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.768
Did you see that?

03:47.768 --> 03:49.940
I was totally scared
but I didn't fear-puke.

03:49.940 --> 03:52.062
I am the bravest woman
I know.

03:54.194 --> 03:56.156
If Avery's
taking the year off,

03:56.156 --> 03:57.698
maybe I'll be Avery this year
and scare you all.

03:57.698 --> 03:59.199
Aww.

03:59.199 --> 04:01.742
I bet you wouldn't "aww" like
that if you realized

04:01.742 --> 04:06.246
you were talking
to the Spatula-Handed Girl!

04:06.246 --> 04:09.129
Aww.

04:09.129 --> 04:11.922
"Look out. She's got
a spatula for a hand.

04:11.922 --> 04:14.675
She's gonna flip us all!"

04:14.675 --> 04:16.507
Aww.

04:17.878 --> 04:19.049
Aww.

04:21.382 --> 04:23.013
No, get out of the house.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.015
Get out of the house!

04:25.015 --> 04:27.227
Get out of the house now!

04:27.227 --> 04:30.311
What was that?
It sounds like
someone's in the house.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.942
I didn't hear anything.

04:31.942 --> 04:33.273
It's coming for you!

04:33.273 --> 04:35.275
Not even that.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.398
Sounds like
it's coming from upstairs.

04:37.398 --> 04:38.859
I better check it out.

04:38.859 --> 04:40.661
We probably just
left the TV on.

04:40.661 --> 04:42.202
I turned the TV off

04:42.202 --> 04:44.495
and then turned it
right back on again.

04:44.495 --> 04:46.286
I'm unpredictable like that.

04:47.368 --> 04:49.079
Don't you understand?

04:49.079 --> 04:50.831
The house is haunted.

04:50.831 --> 04:52.212
Haunted!

04:52.212 --> 04:54.375
Oh, sounds like
a pigeon cooing.

04:54.375 --> 04:57.508
Haunted.
Haunted.

04:58.509 --> 05:00.260
I'll be right back.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.598
"He's coming."

05:07.598 --> 05:09.390
He's coming?

05:09.390 --> 05:10.931
Aaaah!

05:10.931 --> 05:12.603
Aaah!
Aaah!

05:15.105 --> 05:16.276
"This is Avery.

05:16.276 --> 05:18.489
I meant my dad's coming."

05:18.489 --> 05:20.491
Oh, right.

05:23.704 --> 05:30.000
STAN: No need for eye contact,
no need for eye contact.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.915
Okay, if this goes south,
we get in the car,

05:34.915 --> 05:36.457
head to my
cousin's place in Arizona.

05:36.457 --> 05:38.088
He has an
underground bunker.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.259
It's really just a blanket fort
in the backyard,

05:39.259 --> 05:41.762
but he's sensitive,
so play along.

05:41.762 --> 05:43.093
What about Dad?

05:43.093 --> 05:44.595
If he doesn't make it,
I'll remarry

05:44.595 --> 05:46.346
so you'll always have
a father figure.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.928
Oh, thank goodness.

05:47.928 --> 05:49.770
I hate dating.

05:49.770 --> 05:51.892
That's weird.
None of the TVs are on.

05:51.892 --> 05:53.103
And no one's in the house.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.565
I mean, except for Stan.

05:54.565 --> 05:57.237
Stan, uh--
he was just--

05:57.237 --> 05:58.819
The house must be haunted.

05:58.819 --> 06:00.481
What are you kids
covering for?

06:00.481 --> 06:01.742
Nothing.

06:01.742 --> 06:03.193
You heard
what the ghost said.

06:03.193 --> 06:04.615
And he should know.

06:04.615 --> 06:06.827
He's a ghost.

06:08.619 --> 06:11.161
How could you tell Mom and Dad
that the house is haunted?

06:11.161 --> 06:14.124
Now they're suspicious that
we're covering for something.
What are we gonna do?

06:14.124 --> 06:16.256
Obviously, we have to prove
that the house is haunted.

06:16.256 --> 06:18.839
The house is haunted
like the movie I just watched?

06:18.839 --> 06:21.842
What are the odds?

06:21.842 --> 06:23.053
Why couldn't I have just
thought quicker

06:23.053 --> 06:25.005
and come up
with a better lie

06:25.005 --> 06:27.007
about where the voice
was coming from?

06:27.007 --> 06:31.682
I should have blamed the sounds
on the Clog-Handed Girl.

06:31.682 --> 06:33.684
Why would anyone be
afraid of a clog--

06:33.684 --> 06:36.106
Ow.

06:36.106 --> 06:39.069
The house is haunted
and Chloe has a clog hand?

06:39.069 --> 06:41.652
What is going on?!

06:46.577 --> 06:48.659
Now that we told Mom and Dad
the house is haunted,

06:48.659 --> 06:50.160
they think
we're up to something.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.582
What are we going to do?

06:51.582 --> 06:53.454
They can't find out
our dog talks.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.085
Or that
he's really handsome.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.039
I didn't want to say it,
but nobody else was.

07:01.091 --> 07:02.382
We have to convince
Mom and Dad

07:02.382 --> 07:04.094
that the house
is haunted.

07:04.094 --> 07:05.636
Lots of people
believe in ghosts.

07:05.636 --> 07:06.847
I read
a research study--

07:06.847 --> 07:08.348
You read a research study?

07:08.348 --> 07:10.471
I saw it online and I thought
it was about people

07:10.471 --> 07:12.553
who believe in goats.

07:12.553 --> 07:15.315
I believe in goats and I like
reading articles about myself.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.773
You read a research study?

07:22.773 --> 07:27.237
Yes, and it found that 45%
of Americans believe in ghosts.

07:27.237 --> 07:29.239
I'm pretty sure
Mom could be one of them.

07:29.239 --> 07:31.071
Mom is not that gullible.

07:31.071 --> 07:33.123
There's no way
she believes ghosts are real.

07:33.123 --> 07:37.077
I'm telling you, Bennett,
ghosts are real.

07:37.077 --> 07:40.080
Right.
And so are Bigfoot,
leprechauns,

07:40.080 --> 07:42.132
and men who care about
what color you paint
the laundry room.

07:42.132 --> 07:43.253
It's important.

07:43.253 --> 07:45.546
It is not.

07:45.546 --> 07:47.548
Ellen, I'm telling you,
the kids are up to something.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.051
It's not just today.

07:51.051 --> 07:53.303
Every so often, I hear
this strange voice in the house.

07:53.303 --> 07:55.095
I haven't said anything
because I know you all think

07:55.095 --> 07:57.147
I'm so excitable,
but if it's a ghost,

07:57.147 --> 07:59.900
that explains it all.
I'm not crazy.

07:59.900 --> 08:02.152
I would never call you crazy.

08:02.152 --> 08:05.736
You're what I'd call
quirky, eccentric,

08:05.736 --> 08:09.409
borderline ridiculous
and adorable.

08:10.821 --> 08:13.534
I'll take it.
But ghosts are real.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.246
And I'm painting the
laundry room quixotic plum.

08:18.959 --> 08:20.120
Still don't care.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.626
Are you kidding?
Mom is totally gullible.

08:25.626 --> 08:27.387
Well, there was that time
she wrote that letter

08:27.387 --> 08:30.300
to her favorite TV puppet,
Holgar, The Sensitive Viking.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.633
Bennett,
he wrote me back.

08:32.633 --> 08:34.014
He wrote me back.

08:36.186 --> 08:37.808
Honey,
this is a restraining order.

08:39.850 --> 08:41.271
Well, if we do get her
to believe it,

08:41.271 --> 08:43.193
it will solve a lot of
our problems.

08:43.193 --> 08:45.856
Any time she hears Stan,
she'll just figure it's a ghost

08:45.856 --> 08:47.357
and then Stan's secret
will be safe.

08:47.357 --> 08:48.819
You mean my secret workout,

08:48.819 --> 08:50.991
60 seconds a day
to a tighter tush?

08:50.991 --> 08:52.072
'Cause that's more than
a secret,

08:52.072 --> 08:53.533
that's a miracle.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.155
I mean look at this.

08:55.155 --> 08:56.156
Bam.

08:58.158 --> 09:00.540
Even if we can convince Mom
to believe it's a ghost,

09:00.540 --> 09:01.832
what about Dad?

09:01.832 --> 09:03.463
It'll take some
real cleverness

09:03.463 --> 09:05.796
but I think
we can convince him, too.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.258
It might be hard
for me to help...

09:08.258 --> 09:11.051
since my eyeballs fell out!

09:11.051 --> 09:15.515
Chloe, we can see
your actual eyes.
Those are grapes.

09:15.515 --> 09:17.267
Here, hold these
for a second.

09:19.099 --> 09:20.310
Ah! Ah!

09:20.310 --> 09:21.892
Eyeballs!

09:21.892 --> 09:23.604
Was that so hard?

09:30.280 --> 09:33.243
No, Sir Robert, you do not
have a fair maiden

09:33.243 --> 09:36.246
whose honor you must defend.

09:36.246 --> 09:38.038
No, you do not.

09:38.038 --> 09:39.159
No, you do not!

09:41.461 --> 09:43.664
Oh, hey, Stan.
You look great.

09:43.664 --> 09:45.585
Yeah, I wanted to be a mummy,

09:45.585 --> 09:48.258
but Robert insisted
on a couples costume.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.262
Off with their heads.

09:52.262 --> 09:55.475
Oh, the Queen of Hearts.
Let me guess.

09:55.475 --> 09:57.928
Mom looked at you and said,
"You're such a card.

09:59.219 --> 10:01.481
Good one, Ellen."

10:01.481 --> 10:03.103
Yup. That's why
she picked it out.

10:06.066 --> 10:10.230
"Go ceilings."
Oh, you're a ceiling fan.

10:10.230 --> 10:11.902
That's what it is.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.734
I just got it
'cause I like ceilings.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.578
So are you dressed
how you'll look when you're 20?

10:18.578 --> 10:19.870
I'm a teen zombie.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.411
Still not changing
my opinion of

10:21.411 --> 10:22.873
what you'll look like
when you're 20.

10:24.084 --> 10:25.796
You guys,
ready to do this?

10:25.796 --> 10:27.297
We've got to protect
Stan's secret.

10:27.297 --> 10:29.920
What do you kids
think of my costume?

10:29.920 --> 10:31.922
Tell me the tooth.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.094
Dental one, Ellen.

10:34.094 --> 10:35.595
I'm already
regretting this.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.220
Have fun trick-or-treating.
We'll be here handing out candy.

10:40.220 --> 10:42.182
We'll let you know if we hear
any more weird stuff.

10:42.182 --> 10:44.184
That's right.
We'll be trick-or-treating.

10:44.184 --> 10:46.226
'Cause that's what
kids do on Halloween.

10:46.226 --> 10:48.819
They do it.
They don't announce it.

10:48.819 --> 10:50.731
We'll be trick-or-treating
and not announcing it.

10:50.731 --> 10:54.194
'Cause that's what
kids do on Halloween.

10:54.194 --> 10:56.907
Well, be careful, you know,
if the ghost comes back--

10:56.907 --> 10:58.618
Tyler,
don't get your mother

10:58.618 --> 11:00.280
going on that
ghost thing again.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.372
This house is not haunted.

11:02.372 --> 11:05.375
I don't know.
After what happened
last night, I checked online

11:05.375 --> 11:07.587
and I found out there
used to be an old inn

11:07.587 --> 11:09.249
right here
where our house is built.

11:09.249 --> 11:12.552
It was called the Stop On Inn
because back then,

11:12.552 --> 11:13.714
puns were funny.

11:15.255 --> 11:18.138
This website says
an old prospector

11:18.138 --> 11:19.469
came to the inn
to meet his wife,

11:19.469 --> 11:22.012
Annabelle,
but she never showed up.

11:22.012 --> 11:24.684
He waited for her
year after year,

11:24.684 --> 11:26.727
slowly going mad.

11:26.727 --> 11:32.072
Legend has it,
his ghost still waits
for her in this very spot.

11:32.072 --> 11:33.403
Happy Halloween.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.368
Bennett, it's right here
on a website.

11:38.368 --> 11:41.531
Am I crazy or is this the only
explanation that makes sense?

11:41.531 --> 11:44.494
Hold on one sec,
I got to take this.
Hello?

11:44.494 --> 11:45.535
You're talking into your hand.

11:45.535 --> 11:46.787
I know but it's important.

11:49.379 --> 11:52.172
Tyler, how did you find out
about that old prospector?

11:52.172 --> 11:55.255
I made it up and put it
on an online encyclopedia.

11:55.255 --> 11:56.887
Mom thinks because
it's on the internet,

11:56.887 --> 11:58.799
it has to be true.

11:58.799 --> 12:00.971
It's on the internet.
It has to be true.

12:02.182 --> 12:03.894
Now let's start this plan

12:03.894 --> 12:05.645
and convince Mom and Dad,
there's a goat here.

12:05.645 --> 12:08.058
Chloe, you know,
Tyler made a mistake before.

12:08.058 --> 12:10.440
It's "ghost,"
not "goat," right?

12:10.440 --> 12:12.232
Yeah, I know that.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.742
Enjoy your candy.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.786
But don't forget
to brush afterwards.

12:25.786 --> 12:30.170
Gently move the brush
back and forth

12:30.170 --> 12:32.422
in short tooth-wide strokes.

12:33.633 --> 12:35.335
All right,
the kids are gone.

12:35.335 --> 12:37.838
I'm taking this costume off.
What? Why?

12:37.838 --> 12:39.259
I just think
if I'm gonna go through

12:39.259 --> 12:40.801
all the trouble
of brushing you,

12:40.801 --> 12:43.343
either we or the kids
should be enjoying it.

12:45.185 --> 12:46.977
Tyler, let's get
this plan started.

12:46.977 --> 12:48.478
Shh.
I'm learning how to brush.

12:51.651 --> 12:53.603
All right. It's time.
Cue Stan.

12:53.603 --> 12:55.355
Talking Dog to Avery.

12:55.355 --> 12:56.446
Come in, Avery.

12:56.446 --> 12:57.657
Avery here.

12:57.657 --> 12:59.239
Those are your code names?

12:59.239 --> 13:00.570
You're Talking Dog
and he's Avery?

13:00.570 --> 13:01.902
Not now, Tyler.

13:03.323 --> 13:04.955
Phase one, go.

13:04.955 --> 13:06.867
( scary voice )
Annabelle.

13:06.867 --> 13:09.039
Annabelle.

13:09.039 --> 13:13.874
My wife, Annabelle!

13:13.874 --> 13:15.836
Bennett.

13:15.836 --> 13:18.088
I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation--

13:18.088 --> 13:20.050
No. The website Tyler
showed us.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.422
There's a picture
of the prospector's wife on it,

13:22.422 --> 13:24.184
and she looks just like me.

13:27.187 --> 13:28.098
What?

13:31.061 --> 13:32.893
What if he thinks
I'm his wife, Annabelle,

13:32.893 --> 13:34.774
and insists we reunite?

13:34.774 --> 13:36.987
He's a ghost and I'm alive.
It'd never work.

13:36.987 --> 13:40.240
That's it.
I'm calling a ghost hunter
to report paranormal activity.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.742
You have a ghost hunter
on speed dial?

13:42.742 --> 13:44.074
No, that would be
ridiculous.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.246
This is a ghost hunter app.

13:46.246 --> 13:47.868
It sends the nearest one.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.329
It's like they made
the app just for me.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.542
I made this app
just for her.

13:52.542 --> 13:56.546
So you created
a fake ghost hunter
app and a website

13:56.546 --> 13:59.089
and photoshopped a picture
of Mom in Victorian garb.

13:59.089 --> 14:01.671
That's amazing.
How are you getting
all C's in school?

14:01.671 --> 14:05.515
Because I spend all my time
making fake websites,
photos, and apps.

14:05.515 --> 14:09.019
So I just have to reply
that there are no ghost
hunters currently available.

14:09.019 --> 14:12.522
There are no ghost hunters
currently available.

14:12.522 --> 14:15.605
Luckily, I also downloaded
this ghost detector app.

14:15.605 --> 14:18.148
It senses
where the ghosts are.

14:18.148 --> 14:19.149
It's not a real app.

14:19.149 --> 14:20.360
What sets it off?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.441
Me doing this.

14:24.194 --> 14:26.116
( phone beeping )
My phone is going nuts!

14:26.116 --> 14:29.489
Yeah, that's what's going nuts.

14:29.489 --> 14:30.951
( whistle blowing )

14:33.123 --> 14:35.415
Do you hear
a ghostly whistle?

14:35.415 --> 14:37.627
I'm sure it's nothing.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.130
If it's nothing, then why do
I keep jumping into your arms?

14:46.806 --> 14:48.768
It was just the tea kettle.

14:48.768 --> 14:50.350
Can I put you down now?

14:50.350 --> 14:52.772
Okay, but I'm just gonna
jump back up again.

14:52.772 --> 14:54.354
We must have left
the kettle on.

14:54.354 --> 14:57.978
We didn't leave it on.
The prospector did.

14:57.978 --> 14:59.729
I reckon he likes tea.

14:59.729 --> 15:02.362
Reckon?
Why did I say that?

15:02.362 --> 15:04.694
What if the spirit
of Annabelle
is overtaking me?

15:04.694 --> 15:05.735
Dagnabit!

15:05.735 --> 15:07.287
What in Tarnation?

15:08.868 --> 15:10.580
Where is my tea?

15:10.580 --> 15:12.702
I like oolong.

15:12.702 --> 15:17.037
We don't have oolong tea,
Prospector.

15:17.037 --> 15:18.128
See?

15:21.801 --> 15:23.213
Oolong.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.045
It's the scariest tea.

15:26.046 --> 15:27.047
I told you.

15:27.047 --> 15:31.051
The scariest tea is oolong.

15:32.722 --> 15:34.014
Check this out.

15:35.725 --> 15:38.018
There is definitely a logical--

15:40.860 --> 15:42.152
explanation.

15:43.903 --> 15:46.946
You had time
to build a compressor
that shoots tea boxes?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.868
I'm getting some D's too.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.994
( screaming )

15:55.575 --> 15:57.247
Go, go, go!

15:57.247 --> 15:58.878
( Stan barking )

15:58.878 --> 16:00.420
What is it, Stan?

16:00.420 --> 16:01.501
Who are you barking at?

16:01.501 --> 16:02.712
Dogs know.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.084
They see the other side.

16:04.084 --> 16:05.965
Well, then,
why did you buy an app?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.467
It got great reviews.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.390
You wrote reviews?

16:10.390 --> 16:12.512
Some classes
I don't even go to.

16:12.512 --> 16:15.055
Okay, you ready
for the coup de grace?

16:15.055 --> 16:18.098
I don't know. French
is one of the classes
I don't go to.

16:21.101 --> 16:23.153
Annabelle.

16:23.153 --> 16:25.365
It's me!

16:25.365 --> 16:28.488
Don't tell me
you married that guy.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.872
( both screaming )

16:32.872 --> 16:35.165
Just don't puke,
don't puke!

16:35.165 --> 16:36.456
I'm trying not to.

16:36.456 --> 16:39.249
I'm talking to myself!

16:39.249 --> 16:41.291
I believe you.
Ghosts are real.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.332
Yeah.

16:42.332 --> 16:43.463
( laughing )

16:43.463 --> 16:45.545
Wait. What's that?

16:56.056 --> 16:57.597
I told you

16:57.597 --> 17:00.100
there was
a logical explanation for this.

17:02.062 --> 17:05.195
You're the one
who put a ring on quirky.

17:05.195 --> 17:08.198
Man, I cannot believe
the kids got us.

17:08.198 --> 17:09.779
I knew they were
up to something,

17:09.779 --> 17:11.611
starting with that voice
we heard last night at dinner.

17:11.611 --> 17:13.032
But I didn't fear-puke.

17:13.032 --> 17:17.117
I'm still 364 days mouth dry
and going strong.

17:17.117 --> 17:19.249
Well, there's only one thing

17:19.249 --> 17:21.331
we can do now
as responsible adults.

17:21.331 --> 17:23.793
Scare the stuffing out of those
kids to teach them a lesson.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.005
And that is why
I put a ring on quirky.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.802
Come on, Chloe,
fill up your bags

17:32.802 --> 17:34.384
so that Mom and Dad think
we were out trick-or-treating.

17:34.384 --> 17:36.636
You can just buy
Halloween candy?

17:36.636 --> 17:38.057
That's cheating.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.640
And why haven't
we ever done this before?

17:40.640 --> 17:43.022
Kids.

17:43.022 --> 17:46.276
We have some terrible news.

17:46.276 --> 17:47.357
Awful, just awful.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.488
You were right.

17:48.488 --> 17:50.490
The house is haunted.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.862
( kids screaming )

17:54.574 --> 17:55.995
Got ya.

17:55.995 --> 17:57.537
Thought
you could fool us?

17:57.537 --> 17:58.958
You should've
seen your faces.

17:58.958 --> 18:01.871
You were all like...

18:01.871 --> 18:06.045
Annabelle, it's me,
the prospector.

18:06.045 --> 18:10.049
I'm inside the dog.

18:11.171 --> 18:13.092
( screaming )

18:13.092 --> 18:15.845
( throwing up )

18:15.845 --> 18:19.098
( screaming )

18:19.098 --> 18:21.221
Stan, why would you do that?

18:21.221 --> 18:22.682
They just saw you talk.

18:22.682 --> 18:24.063
I couldn't help myself.

18:24.063 --> 18:26.146
I didn't like the way
they were gloating.

18:26.146 --> 18:29.319
And that thing that popped
out really scared me.

18:29.319 --> 18:31.991
And why is there a goat
in the family room?

18:33.733 --> 18:36.075
I paid for two hours,
I'm getting two hours.

18:36.075 --> 18:37.907
Now excuse me while I pet.

18:42.041 --> 18:43.503
What? What?

18:43.503 --> 18:44.544
Wait, the kids.

18:44.544 --> 18:45.705
They didn't follow us.

18:45.705 --> 18:46.956
We have to go back.

18:46.956 --> 18:49.128
Right, right.
We can do this.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.051
We have to conquer
our fear of ghosts.

18:53.092 --> 18:54.254
( screaming )

18:59.429 --> 19:01.561
We did it.
Whoo.

19:01.561 --> 19:02.722
Kids.

19:02.722 --> 19:03.973
Are you okay?

19:03.973 --> 19:07.437
Step away
from the ghost dog.

19:10.570 --> 19:13.152
We got you.
You should've
seen your faces.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.325
If you're mad,
I'm not part of this.

19:16.326 --> 19:18.157
But Stan talked.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.949
I saw him.
So it had to be a ghost.

19:19.949 --> 19:21.411
Dogs can't talk.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.492
Of course not.
That'd be crazy.

19:22.492 --> 19:23.583
Stan, run for it.

19:26.746 --> 19:29.088
Mom, it was just
one of my Halloween tricks.

19:29.088 --> 19:31.421
I used peanut butter
to make his mouth move.

19:31.421 --> 19:33.092
Watch.

19:34.714 --> 19:36.346
And I did the voice.

19:36.346 --> 19:40.059
"It's me, the prospector.

19:40.059 --> 19:43.102
I'm inside the dog."

19:44.604 --> 19:46.856
Wow.
You guys really got us.

19:46.856 --> 19:50.610
Yeah, but what Stan just
did didn't look like
what I saw before.

19:50.610 --> 19:52.612
It's just the way
the mind works, honey.

19:52.612 --> 19:54.654
The fear fills
in the details.

19:54.654 --> 19:57.076
Oh, like when you accidentally
swallow a mouthful of water

19:57.076 --> 19:59.739
at the water park and you start
picturing all the sweaty,

19:59.739 --> 20:02.242
hairy people
who've been in the--

20:02.242 --> 20:05.164
I'm also a regular puker.
Go, go, go.

20:07.997 --> 20:10.039
Man, that was too close.

20:10.039 --> 20:12.171
Yeah, you've really
got to be more careful

20:12.171 --> 20:13.383
about talking, Stan.

20:13.383 --> 20:16.005
Go Kung Fu Fart Chimps.

20:16.005 --> 20:18.177
Hai-ya!

20:18.177 --> 20:19.639
( chimps screeching )

20:19.639 --> 20:21.801
( punching )

20:21.801 --> 20:23.433
( jingling bells )

20:23.433 --> 20:24.514
Ooh, it's the Christmas one.

20:28.438 --> 20:31.020
All in all,
it was a great Halloween.

20:31.020 --> 20:32.772
My secret's still safe,

20:32.772 --> 20:34.854
and everybody
got to scare somebody.

20:34.854 --> 20:37.947
And it turns out Sir Robert
did have a fair maiden.

20:40.119 --> 20:41.741
He and Miss Beaks,
the oven mitt,

20:41.741 --> 20:43.202
met in the laundry hamper

20:43.202 --> 20:45.164
and have been going
gangbusters ever since.

20:45.164 --> 20:47.076
Isn't that right, Robert?

20:47.076 --> 20:49.038
Robert, where's Miss Beaks?

20:53.132 --> 20:55.134
Oh, no, Robert.

20:55.134 --> 20:56.175
Look away.

20:56.175 --> 20:58.007
Look away.

21:01.381 --> 21:02.842
Mom and Dad really
seemed to be--

21:02.842 --> 21:04.304
Boo!

21:04.304 --> 21:07.096
Come on, Chloe,
that's so lame.

21:07.096 --> 21:08.518
You're a cute little kid.
Just accept it.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.099
You're never gonna be
able to scare us.

21:10.099 --> 21:11.851
A little kid?

21:11.851 --> 21:13.813
That's what you think of me?
Just some little kid?

21:13.813 --> 21:16.656
Calm down.
I'm not just
a little kid!

21:19.819 --> 21:21.611
Aah!

21:25.244 --> 21:27.076
That was awesome, Chloe.
How did you do that?

21:27.076 --> 21:29.869
( in demonic voice )
Do what?

21:31.250 --> 21:33.373
Aah!

21:35.375 --> 21:38.177
Thanks, Stan.
How did you get so good
at special effects?

21:38.177 --> 21:40.380
I have a lot of practice
from all those years

21:40.380 --> 21:42.221
of making it look like
I talk.

21:42.221 --> 21:43.222
What?

21:43.222 --> 21:44.263
Nah, I'm just kidding.

21:44.263 --> 21:46.135
I'm a normal talking dog.
