00:00.102 --> 00:03.070
A few months ago, I discovered
<i>I had a twin sister,</i>

00:03.104 --> 00:05.272
<i>and then she asked me</i>
<i>to take her place,</i>

00:05.306 --> 00:07.174
<i>keep the secret,</i>
<i>find our real mother</i>

00:07.208 --> 00:09.076
<i>and try to stay alive.</i>

00:09.110 --> 00:12.100
<i>Put yourself in my shoes.</i>

00:12.134 --> 00:15.059
<i>How long could you keep up</i>
<i>the lying game?</i>

00:15.093 --> 00:16.490
<i>Previously on</i> 
The Lying Game:

00:16.525 --> 00:18.053
You are a vindictive

00:18.087 --> 00:19.119
little bitch.

00:19.154 --> 00:20.185
You're finished here.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.151
(Screams)

00:21.185 --> 00:23.484
(Tires screeching, crashing)

00:23.518 --> 00:25.085
(Screaming, bubbling)

00:25.119 --> 00:26.486
What else did Ted tell you?

00:26.521 --> 00:28.358
I want to keep the past
in the past.

00:28.392 --> 00:30.189
I've had enough drama
in my life.

00:30.223 --> 00:32.323
I don't really want to go
digging around for more.

00:32.357 --> 00:35.055
Ted: <i>I'd prefer that Rebecca</i>
<i>wasn't curled up on my couch</i>

00:35.089 --> 00:37.121
at home, getting all
chummy with my wife.

00:37.155 --> 00:38.321
Maybe we need
time apart.

00:38.355 --> 00:40.055
You're breaking up with me?

00:40.089 --> 00:42.427
Yeah, I guess so.

00:44.229 --> 00:46.063
I think Sutton's dead.

00:46.097 --> 00:48.231
And I'm pretty sure
I know who killed her.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.166
Maybe a birth mother who
never wanted to be found.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.402
Annie Hobbs.

00:51.436 --> 00:53.205
It's Annie Hobbs.
She's escaped.

00:54.140 --> 00:55.107
I'm sorry.

00:55.141 --> 00:57.476
Have I come at a bad time?

01:01.081 --> 01:02.181
Emma:
<i>Sutton!</i>

01:02.216 --> 01:04.150
You're alive!

01:04.184 --> 01:07.220
Did I just walk in
on my own funeral?

01:10.425 --> 01:14.195
Because if so,
I've got to say...

01:16.198 --> 01:18.165
The turnout kind of sucks.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.501
Oh, my God, Sutton, we've
been freaking out over here.

01:21.536 --> 01:24.136
Yeah, you and me both.

01:25.272 --> 01:27.105
Where the hell
have you been?

01:27.139 --> 01:28.472
We must've left you
a hundred messages.

01:28.507 --> 01:31.407
Did it ever occur to you to let
someone know you were okay?

01:31.441 --> 01:34.409
Well, if I could have,
I would have, Ethan.

01:34.444 --> 01:36.210
Anyway, I
wasn't aware

01:36.245 --> 01:38.178
that my well-being
was such a concern

01:38.213 --> 01:41.082
for people who think I'm such
a-- what was it again?--

01:41.116 --> 01:44.419
vindictive little bitch.

01:44.453 --> 01:46.321
Thayer:
We're glad you're okay.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.422
But Ethan's right.

01:47.457 --> 01:49.157
Making us worry
like that is sick.

01:50.126 --> 01:51.160
Even for you.

01:57.435 --> 02:00.070
Thayer: Someone dropped
that off at your house

02:00.104 --> 02:02.139
the night after you disappeared.

02:02.173 --> 02:04.240
Came wrapped in a present

02:04.275 --> 02:08.077
with a piece of the dress that
you were wearing that night.

02:08.112 --> 02:09.145
Sound familiar?

02:09.180 --> 02:10.347
Emma:
Ethan...

02:10.382 --> 02:12.416
No, it's okay.

02:12.450 --> 02:14.351
Just want to know
what she thinks.

02:14.386 --> 02:16.086
I mean, this is

02:16.121 --> 02:17.187
the first time you're hearing

02:17.222 --> 02:18.321
about any of this, right?

02:20.357 --> 02:22.291
What are you trying
to say, Ethan?

02:22.326 --> 02:24.093
That I wrote this note?

02:24.127 --> 02:26.162
That it was just
all part of some

02:26.196 --> 02:29.198
crazy plan to get back at you
for, I don't know,

02:29.233 --> 02:31.100
stabbing me in the back?

02:31.135 --> 02:34.236
I don't know
who wrote this note,

02:34.271 --> 02:37.140
but one thing in it
is definitely true.

02:39.142 --> 02:41.210
Somebody did try to kill me.

03:11.406 --> 03:14.107
Well, this place brings
back fun memories.

03:14.142 --> 03:16.309
Well, where else could we go?

03:16.344 --> 03:18.044
My parents--

03:18.078 --> 03:21.113
I mean, Ted and Kristin

03:21.148 --> 03:23.182
were gonna come home
any minute.

03:23.216 --> 03:26.218
How are they?

03:26.253 --> 03:28.120
Um, good.

03:28.154 --> 03:32.223
So you still haven't told us
what happened that night.

03:32.258 --> 03:37.328
Well, I was on my way
to the party, and...

03:37.362 --> 03:41.132
Someone jumped up from
the backseat and grabbed me.

03:41.166 --> 03:43.134
And that's when you went
into the water?

03:43.168 --> 03:44.301
How did you know?

03:44.336 --> 03:45.503
Your family's car--

03:45.537 --> 03:47.505
the cops pulled it
out of the lake the other day.

03:47.539 --> 03:50.241
Emma took the heat
for stealing it.

03:50.275 --> 03:51.275
Emma:
Doesn't matter.

03:51.310 --> 03:52.443
Did you see who attacked you?

03:52.477 --> 03:54.144
No, no.

03:54.179 --> 03:55.145
It happened so fast

03:55.180 --> 03:57.281
I couldn't see a face.

03:57.315 --> 03:59.483
Okay, I know this is
going to sound crazy,

03:59.517 --> 04:02.152
but we were
all thinking

04:02.186 --> 04:04.120
Annie Hobbs had
something to do with it.

04:04.155 --> 04:06.122
No, you're way off.

04:06.157 --> 04:08.157
In fact, if there's one person
who didn't try to kill me,

04:08.192 --> 04:09.225
it was her.

04:09.259 --> 04:10.359
How can you
be so sure?

04:10.394 --> 04:12.294
Because our mother was the one

04:12.329 --> 04:14.196
who saved my life.

04:17.033 --> 04:20.336
So, I saw your car at the club

04:20.370 --> 04:23.172
when I was leaving
with Laurel.

04:23.207 --> 04:26.142
What were you doing
there so late?

04:26.176 --> 04:30.080
Uh, I was just talking to Alec
about a few things.

04:30.114 --> 04:31.315
Lost track of time.

04:31.349 --> 04:33.317
How is Laurel?

04:33.351 --> 04:37.088
She's a 16-year-old who just
had her first heartbreak.

04:37.122 --> 04:38.356
She's a mess.

04:38.390 --> 04:42.159
How'd your little heart-to-heart
with Rebecca go?

04:42.193 --> 04:45.496
Well, it's a tough situation
with Phyllis and Char.

04:45.530 --> 04:48.099
I think she just needed
someone to listen.

04:48.133 --> 04:50.367
Kind of weird, though,
she came to you.

04:50.401 --> 04:52.435
I mean, you guys, you
barely know each other.

04:55.139 --> 04:57.440
Well, that could change soon.

04:57.474 --> 04:59.341
You know
the junior ballet benefit

04:59.376 --> 05:01.343
I co-host with Phyllis
every year?

05:01.378 --> 05:04.246
Yeah, the one where Phyllis
volunteers her backyard

05:04.280 --> 05:06.248
and you do all the work.

05:06.282 --> 05:07.416
That is the one.

05:07.450 --> 05:09.051
Well, Rebecca has
graciously offered

05:09.085 --> 05:10.186
to step in for Phyllis.

05:10.220 --> 05:12.455
Oh.

05:12.489 --> 05:16.258
I think she really
wants us to be friends.

05:16.292 --> 05:20.129
Well, then that is good news.

05:22.032 --> 05:24.267
So I don't remember the crash
or going into the water,

05:24.302 --> 05:28.272
but the next thing I knew,
I was waking up in a motel room.

05:28.306 --> 05:31.208
And then, there she was.

05:31.243 --> 05:33.010
Annie?

05:33.045 --> 05:35.180
Your mother?

05:35.214 --> 05:36.281
Really?

05:36.315 --> 05:39.117
She was... so kind.

05:39.151 --> 05:40.384
And she took care of me,

05:40.419 --> 05:43.454
she went over to the diner
next door, got me food.

05:43.488 --> 05:45.189
Did she tell you
how you got there?

05:45.223 --> 05:46.456
I mean, you were

05:46.491 --> 05:49.393
trapped in a car underwater.

05:49.427 --> 05:52.428
She said that she was
following me that night.

05:52.462 --> 05:55.431
And she saw the crash,
she saw me go into the water,

05:55.465 --> 05:58.433
and then she saw
a dark-haired guy

05:58.467 --> 06:02.304
swim to shore
and climb out of the lake.

06:02.338 --> 06:04.239
She didn't see his face.

06:04.273 --> 06:05.340
Okay, so how'd
you get out?

06:05.375 --> 06:06.341
You should've drowned.

06:06.376 --> 06:09.044
Annie said she dove in

06:09.078 --> 06:11.013
and pulled me out of the water.

06:11.047 --> 06:12.180
What do you think,

06:12.215 --> 06:13.348
I'm making this up?

06:13.382 --> 06:15.283
Emma:
No.

06:15.317 --> 06:18.019
It's just kind of weird.

06:18.054 --> 06:20.054
Someone tried to kill me!

06:20.089 --> 06:21.256
They could be
watching us right now.

06:21.290 --> 06:22.290
And Emma is in danger.

06:22.325 --> 06:23.458
In fact, we all are

06:23.492 --> 06:25.260
until we figure out
who did this.

06:25.294 --> 06:29.063
Where is Annie now?

06:29.098 --> 06:32.133
She's at range creek motel,
room 134.

06:32.167 --> 06:34.134
I just left her there
about an hour ago.

06:34.169 --> 06:37.037
She was fine yesterday,
and then this morning,

06:37.071 --> 06:40.140
I said something about
leaving, and she flipped out

06:40.175 --> 06:42.209
and turned into
a completely different person.

06:42.243 --> 06:45.246
And I waited until she
fell asleep and came here.

06:45.281 --> 06:47.215
So, if Annie's here
like you said,

06:47.249 --> 06:49.084
I think it's very important
that we talk to her.

06:49.118 --> 06:50.319
Sutton: He's right,
we need to hurry.

06:50.353 --> 06:52.421
And you, Emma,
need to get back to my house

06:52.455 --> 06:54.257
before somebody notices
that you're gone.

06:54.291 --> 06:56.225
No.

06:56.260 --> 06:57.393
What, after all this time?

06:57.428 --> 07:00.063
If our birth mother is here,
I want to meet her.

07:00.097 --> 07:02.132
And you will.

07:02.166 --> 07:04.100
But if someone thinks I'm dead,

07:04.135 --> 07:06.035
we can't risk
being seen together.

07:06.070 --> 07:08.037
And until this cut
on my head heals,

07:08.072 --> 07:09.372
you need to keep being me.

07:10.407 --> 07:12.208
Okay.

07:12.242 --> 07:14.243
Let's go meet mom.

07:33.266 --> 07:35.368
Nothing.

07:35.402 --> 07:37.403
She's gone.

07:37.438 --> 07:40.006
Big surprise.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.241
So, you guys ready
to go or...

07:42.276 --> 07:44.444
Want to head next door
and look for the easter bunny?

07:44.478 --> 07:46.178
No!

07:46.213 --> 07:47.346
She was here.

07:47.381 --> 07:49.315
Why would I make
something like this up?

07:49.349 --> 07:51.150
You mean other
than to completely

07:51.184 --> 07:54.186
screw over three people
who used to care about you?

07:56.322 --> 07:58.090
Thayer.

07:58.124 --> 07:59.324
(Chuckles softly)

07:59.359 --> 08:01.226
All right, give me five minutes.

08:01.261 --> 08:05.264
I'll check the front desk
and see if anyone saw anything.

08:15.176 --> 08:21.281
Ethan, I know you probably
won't believe me, but...

08:23.184 --> 08:25.352
I really am sorry

08:25.387 --> 08:30.023
for all the strain
I put on you guys.

08:30.057 --> 08:31.257
I had no idea things would...

08:31.291 --> 08:32.357
Yeah.

08:32.393 --> 08:34.360
You're right.

08:34.395 --> 08:37.130
I don't believe you.

08:43.049 --> 08:46.151
134.
Oh, right.

08:46.185 --> 08:47.252
Hot girl.

08:47.286 --> 08:49.321
Nice eyes.

08:49.355 --> 08:51.256
Had kind of a nasty ding
on her forehead, though.

08:51.290 --> 08:52.324
Yeah, that's her.

08:52.358 --> 08:54.026
Uh, I was actually
wondering about

08:54.061 --> 08:55.194
the other person in the room.

08:55.228 --> 08:56.462
Woman, early 40s?

08:56.496 --> 08:58.264
Nah, I didn't see
anybody like that.

08:58.299 --> 09:00.233
S-so, the chick
with the bump on her head,

09:00.268 --> 09:03.003
is, uh, she, like,
your girlfriend or something?

09:03.037 --> 09:05.339
'Cause she was really...

09:05.373 --> 09:06.406
No, she's not.

09:06.441 --> 09:08.108
Listen, is there any way

09:08.142 --> 09:10.110
you could check your records?

09:10.144 --> 09:11.946
Are you kidding me?

09:11.980 --> 09:13.981
With all these people
coming and going at all hours,

09:14.016 --> 09:15.416
most of them
paying cash?

09:15.451 --> 09:19.287
I mean, you do realize this
ain't the four seasons, right?

09:19.322 --> 09:21.289
Emma:
<i>I'm home!</i>

09:21.323 --> 09:23.358
(Tv playing quietly)

09:25.294 --> 09:27.028
Hey, what are you
still doing up?

09:27.063 --> 09:28.130
Nothing.

09:28.164 --> 09:30.966
Just sitting here,

09:31.001 --> 09:32.368
wondering if it's too
late to call Justin.

09:32.402 --> 09:34.203
Oh, Laurel.

09:34.237 --> 09:37.106
Oh, I'm not going to beg him
to take me back or anything.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.342
I just wanted to scream
at him a little,

09:39.376 --> 09:41.210
tell him what an
ass he's been.

09:41.245 --> 09:43.246
Mm, yeah.
Too late for that.

09:45.416 --> 09:48.418
Probably should have
seen it coming, right?

09:48.452 --> 09:53.289
I mean, our whole relationship
started as a lie.

09:53.323 --> 09:57.427
Fake parents,
fake address.

09:57.461 --> 10:02.231
Why should I be surprised
he was seeing other girls?

10:02.265 --> 10:05.434
You make a good point.

10:05.469 --> 10:07.470
Okay, what can I
do to help?

10:10.441 --> 10:12.342
Well...
Hmm?

10:12.376 --> 10:14.310
You could
always help me

10:14.345 --> 10:19.248
steal Justin's car, maybe
sink it in the lake?

10:19.283 --> 10:22.151
Yeah, uh, I'm not
gonna do that.

10:22.186 --> 10:23.152
Okay.

10:23.187 --> 10:24.353
(Both laugh)

10:24.388 --> 10:26.088
It was worth a shot.

10:26.122 --> 10:28.023
Yeah.

10:28.057 --> 10:34.363
Look, I understand why
you wouldn't believe me.

10:34.397 --> 10:36.198
Yeah, and?

10:36.232 --> 10:40.101
And I think we both know
that the old Sutton

10:40.136 --> 10:44.373
was capable of something
so elaborate and heartless.

10:44.407 --> 10:47.175
"The old Sutton"?

10:49.212 --> 10:51.080
I'm not that girl anymore.

10:51.114 --> 10:52.448
Oh.

10:52.482 --> 10:55.451
And I'm supposed to
believe this because...?

10:55.486 --> 10:59.089
Because I'm
different.

11:00.458 --> 11:03.327
Because...

11:03.361 --> 11:07.031
Well, when you've been through
something like I have,

11:07.065 --> 11:08.432
it changes you.

11:08.467 --> 11:12.136
And... after I
was attacked,

11:12.170 --> 11:16.340
I realized how badly
I've treated you.

11:16.375 --> 11:19.409
I just want
another chance.

11:19.444 --> 11:21.178
As friends.

11:21.212 --> 11:23.447
That's it-- friends.

11:27.052 --> 11:29.286
Hey. What happened?

11:29.321 --> 11:30.488
Did someone see her?

11:30.522 --> 11:32.290
Afraid not.

11:32.324 --> 11:36.060
So you think I'm lying, too?

11:38.197 --> 11:41.166
I know it sounds crazy,
but she seems so convinced.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.302
Well, all I know
is what Thayer and I saw

11:43.336 --> 11:45.204
at the hotel room,
and that's nothing.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.405
But what if it
is true?

11:46.439 --> 11:48.441
Or what if
some version

11:48.475 --> 11:51.244
of what she's saying
really did happen?

11:51.278 --> 11:52.478
That means that there's
somebody out there

11:52.513 --> 11:54.146
who is willing to kill

11:54.181 --> 11:56.149
to hide the fact
that there are two of us.

11:56.183 --> 11:59.051
Look, look, this is exactly
what you can't do, Emma.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.986
You can't let
her suck you in.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.254
You can't trust her.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.455
So what do we do?

12:03.490 --> 12:05.090
We watch her.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.392
Well, where is she now?

12:08.095 --> 12:10.062
Well, obviously,
she can't stay here.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.365
So...

12:12.399 --> 12:14.334
She's at Thayer's.

12:16.170 --> 12:19.472
Actually, I kind of let it slip
that Dan was out of town

12:19.507 --> 12:22.342
on a fishing trip.

12:22.377 --> 12:24.444
Which I'm already
starting to regret.

12:26.181 --> 12:28.082
No. It's fine.

12:29.351 --> 12:31.453
It's great.

12:40.298 --> 12:42.432
Hope it's okay
I borrowed your robe.

12:42.467 --> 12:44.268
Totally okay.

12:44.302 --> 12:46.070
It's Dan's.

12:46.104 --> 12:47.171
Oh.

12:47.205 --> 12:48.506
Here.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.541
Emma packed this stuff for you.

12:52.444 --> 12:55.145
Thanks.

12:55.180 --> 12:58.381
Look, I know
you're mad, but I...

12:58.416 --> 13:00.984
I do appreciate you
letting me stay here.

13:01.018 --> 13:03.320
Well, it's only
for a couple nights,

13:03.354 --> 13:05.422
and you didn't give me
much of a choice.

13:05.456 --> 13:07.457
Right.

13:09.192 --> 13:11.160
Hard to believe, though.

13:11.194 --> 13:12.427
What is?

13:12.462 --> 13:14.296
Well, that we've known
each other for so long

13:14.330 --> 13:16.264
and this is the first time
I'm in your house.

13:16.298 --> 13:18.199
Wow.

13:18.233 --> 13:20.434
You must have hit your head
pretty hard, huh?

13:21.470 --> 13:24.005
Yeah. Why?

13:24.039 --> 13:26.107
Because, if you had
any recollection

13:26.141 --> 13:28.208
of you and me together,

13:28.243 --> 13:32.246
you'd know that there's nothing
surprising about that at all.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.315
Good night, Sutton.

13:58.768 --> 14:00.736
Morning.

14:02.639 --> 14:04.640
Thayer.

14:05.775 --> 14:07.475
Expecting someone else?

14:08.744 --> 14:10.478
Ethan had
to go to school,

14:10.513 --> 14:12.580
so he asked me to stop by.

14:13.816 --> 14:15.716
Made you eggs.

14:15.751 --> 14:17.351
Thanks.

14:17.385 --> 14:18.719
Yeah, no problem.

14:18.753 --> 14:20.687
Look, I really can't stay long.

14:20.721 --> 14:22.755
Ethan said he'll check
on you at lunch.

14:22.790 --> 14:25.826
In the meantime,
I brought you some supplies.

14:25.860 --> 14:27.828
Got you some food,

14:27.862 --> 14:31.599
magazines, prepaid phone.

14:31.633 --> 14:33.367
While you're alone,

14:33.402 --> 14:34.635
you should probably
just stay inside

14:34.670 --> 14:36.471
and, obviously,
don't let anybody in.

14:36.505 --> 14:38.406
Of course.

14:38.441 --> 14:39.641
Yeah.

14:39.675 --> 14:41.410
Hey, Thayer.

14:41.444 --> 14:43.445
Yeah?

14:44.547 --> 14:46.581
Look, I know
we didn't...

14:46.615 --> 14:48.850
Exactly leave things
in L.A. on...

14:48.884 --> 14:50.718
On the best of terms.

14:50.753 --> 14:52.687
Just want you to know...
Let me guess.

14:54.456 --> 14:57.792
You appreciate
everything I've done for you,

14:57.826 --> 15:01.395
you value my friendship
and my support,

15:01.430 --> 15:03.397
and you don't know

15:03.431 --> 15:04.731
what you would ever
do without me.

15:04.766 --> 15:07.501
You make that sound
like it's a bad thing.

15:07.536 --> 15:08.769
Well, maybe, for me, it is.

15:08.803 --> 15:10.538
(Sighs) Thayer...

15:10.572 --> 15:12.339
Sutton, things
ended badly

15:12.374 --> 15:13.741
between us in L.A.
for one reason.

15:13.775 --> 15:15.643
You knew how I felt about you,
and you still

15:15.677 --> 15:17.445
slept with me
just to get back at Ethan.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.514
(Sighs)

15:19.548 --> 15:21.616
I'm sorry.
(Scoffs)

15:21.651 --> 15:23.585
It was a mistake,
and if I could

15:23.619 --> 15:24.720
go back...
You know what?

15:24.754 --> 15:26.488
It's a little too late for that.

15:28.825 --> 15:31.494
So what,
I've lost you, too, now?

15:32.596 --> 15:34.497
I didn't say that.

15:34.532 --> 15:36.566
What do you mean?

15:36.600 --> 15:38.769
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

15:46.444 --> 15:48.545
Thank you. Thank you.

15:48.579 --> 15:50.513
Stop saying thank
you, Kristin.

15:50.547 --> 15:52.781
Honestly, I'm
happy to help.

15:52.816 --> 15:56.418
Besides, it gives us
a chance to catch up.

15:56.452 --> 15:57.819
Well, that's... that's kind of

15:57.853 --> 15:59.787
what I was thinking.

15:59.822 --> 16:01.455
Hey.

16:01.489 --> 16:02.623
Hello, girls.

16:02.657 --> 16:03.791
Hey.

16:03.825 --> 16:05.493
Hello, Rebecca.

16:05.527 --> 16:08.462
Seems like I'm running
into you everywhere.

16:08.497 --> 16:12.400
Yeah, well, I'm just helping
out with the big benefit.

16:12.435 --> 16:14.402
Actually, Rebecca
has a great idea

16:14.437 --> 16:16.571
for entertainment for the party.

16:16.605 --> 16:20.574
Did you know that she worked
in the music industry in L.A.?

16:20.609 --> 16:21.843
Oh. No, I didn't.

16:21.877 --> 16:23.611
I was thinking,
I know a couple

16:23.645 --> 16:25.413
of young artists that
might be willing

16:25.447 --> 16:27.415
to play at the benefit
for just the exposure.

16:27.449 --> 16:28.582
That's good.
The kids will love that.

16:28.617 --> 16:29.750
They'll think it's dope.

16:31.853 --> 16:33.587
What, the kids
don't say that anymore?

16:33.622 --> 16:35.689
(Phone rings)
I'm going to take that.

16:38.526 --> 16:39.760
Uh, Rebecca Sewell.

16:41.429 --> 16:42.596
Yes.

16:42.630 --> 16:44.632
Laurel:

16:44.666 --> 16:46.433

16:46.467 --> 16:47.734

16:47.769 --> 16:52.406

16:52.440 --> 16:56.743

17:01.415 --> 17:02.715
Ethan:
Don't tell me you're not hungry.

17:02.749 --> 17:04.717
It's just, when you said
you were bringing me lunch,

17:04.752 --> 17:08.587
I didn't realize it was going
to be from the school cafeteria.

17:09.623 --> 17:11.824
Hey! I found her.

17:11.858 --> 17:13.525
Who?

17:13.560 --> 17:14.660
Annie Hobbs. She's here.

17:14.694 --> 17:16.428
Or at least she was.

17:16.462 --> 17:17.762
I was on my way
to a meeting,

17:17.797 --> 17:19.431
and then it occurred
to me that while

17:19.464 --> 17:20.665
that crappy motel doesn't have

17:20.699 --> 17:22.367
a surveillance system,
the diner next door

17:22.401 --> 17:23.501
that shares
the parking lot might.

17:23.536 --> 17:24.703
Fortunately,
I was able to charm

17:24.737 --> 17:25.837
the 80-year-old
manager

17:25.871 --> 17:27.473
into letting me
access their footage.

17:27.507 --> 17:28.808
And voilà.

17:37.552 --> 17:39.420
Oh, my God.

17:39.455 --> 17:41.589
That's Annie.

17:41.624 --> 17:43.625
Looks like some people
need to start apologizing

17:43.659 --> 17:45.627
until I tell them to stop.

17:46.796 --> 17:48.396
(School bell ringing)

17:48.431 --> 17:49.531
Mads:
<i>Well, I talked to char.</i>

17:49.565 --> 17:50.799
She said
her dad's being

17:50.833 --> 17:52.434
totally apologetic
about everything,

17:52.468 --> 17:54.536
and he even offered
to buy her a pony.

17:54.570 --> 17:56.605
Couple years too late.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.607
No, she's considering it.

17:58.642 --> 18:01.410
God. Look who's here.

18:01.445 --> 18:02.812
Who?
Ryan Harwell.

18:02.846 --> 18:04.480
Rich, snotty,
entitled.

18:04.515 --> 18:05.715
You hate him.
How could you forget?

18:05.749 --> 18:07.350
Mads Rybak.

18:07.384 --> 18:08.785
What a surprise.

18:08.819 --> 18:10.553
I'm walking
to history class, Ryan.

18:10.588 --> 18:11.788
What's so surprising
about that?

18:11.823 --> 18:13.757
Well, then, you've
at least got to be

18:13.792 --> 18:15.759
a little surprised
to see me.

18:15.794 --> 18:17.529
Sutton.

18:17.563 --> 18:19.464
Hi.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.799
You know,
that is literally

18:20.833 --> 18:22.801
the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.703
Now that you mention it, Ryan,
what are you doing here?

18:25.738 --> 18:28.405
Aren't you supposed to be away
at some fancy boarding school?

18:28.440 --> 18:32.475
I was. Uh, unfortunately,
after a little more than a year,

18:32.510 --> 18:34.644
middlebrook academy
decided they no longer

18:34.678 --> 18:36.512
had anything more to offer me.

18:36.547 --> 18:38.447
Kicked you out, huh?

18:38.482 --> 18:39.649
Yeah.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.550
I'm pretty sure it
was the hammerhead shark

18:41.585 --> 18:43.386
I snuck into
the water polo pool.

18:43.420 --> 18:44.520
Anyway...

18:44.555 --> 18:46.389
It's great
to be back.

18:46.424 --> 18:48.525
Now I can finally ask you
on that elusive second date

18:48.559 --> 18:49.693
you've been making me
wait for.

18:49.727 --> 18:51.728
Mm, yeah, I don't
see that happening.

18:51.762 --> 18:53.430
Fair enough.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.665
You got history class.

18:54.699 --> 18:57.468
Plus, I've got the whole
rest of the school year

18:57.503 --> 18:59.504
to change your mind.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.442
Geez. Can you
believe that guy?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.610
What? He was being nice.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.779
Nice?
Mm-hmm.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.514
Sutton, you hate him.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.449
Remember in ninth grade,
when you told everybody

19:11.484 --> 19:13.718
you saw his mom buying
his jeans at GAP kids?

19:13.753 --> 19:15.520
Was she?

19:15.554 --> 19:17.388
Yeah. (Chuckles)

19:17.422 --> 19:19.490
Well, he has definitely
had a growth spurt.

19:19.524 --> 19:20.791
Maybe he's changed.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.660
Sometimes people
can do that.

19:22.694 --> 19:24.561
You, definitely.

19:24.595 --> 19:26.797
Ryan?
Highly doubtful.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.769
Dan just left a message that
he's coming back early,

19:31.803 --> 19:34.672
so we need to find another
place for Sutton to stay.

19:34.706 --> 19:36.741
(Sighs)
No argument here.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.744
Did you tell her?

19:38.778 --> 19:41.480
No. I tried the cell phone
that thayer gave her,

19:41.514 --> 19:42.781
but she didn't answer.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.650
You don't think
she got bored

19:44.684 --> 19:46.652
and decided to do
something stupid, do you?

19:46.687 --> 19:48.755
Sutton Mercer?

19:48.789 --> 19:51.624
No. Never.

20:01.537 --> 20:03.771
Kristin: Yeah, I was
wondering if I could

20:03.805 --> 20:06.774
bring over those
serving platters.

20:06.808 --> 20:08.575
I'm on my way to
a tennis lesson.

20:08.610 --> 20:09.710
Is this a good time?

20:09.744 --> 20:10.877
Great.

20:10.912 --> 20:13.512

21:14.875 --> 21:17.410
No, that's okay. I'm fine.
Just hold still for a sec...

21:17.445 --> 21:18.779
Don't touch me, okay?

21:20.448 --> 21:21.682
Sutton.

21:22.884 --> 21:24.819
I don't care how
sick you're feeling.

21:24.853 --> 21:27.587
Don't ever speak to
me like that again.

21:35.629 --> 21:37.763
What the hell
are you doing here?

21:37.797 --> 21:40.832
I came home to take a bath
and... some other things.

21:40.867 --> 21:43.701
Okay, this isn't just
stupid; It's dangerous.

21:43.736 --> 21:44.902
How did you
even get here?

21:44.937 --> 21:46.838
Would you relax?
It's okay.

21:46.872 --> 21:48.640
No, it's not!

21:48.674 --> 21:51.910
And how can you talk
to Kristin that way?

21:51.944 --> 21:53.745
She was trying
to take care of you.

21:53.779 --> 21:55.513
Oh, so now you're
going to tell me

21:55.548 --> 21:56.648
how to talk to my mother?

21:56.682 --> 21:58.516
(Scoffs)

21:58.551 --> 22:00.618
You don't get it, do you?

22:00.652 --> 22:04.489
You have so much and you
just take it for granted.

22:04.523 --> 22:06.758
And in fact, I...

22:06.792 --> 22:10.595
No, please, tell me.
I want to hear you say it.

22:10.629 --> 22:12.663
You don't think

22:12.698 --> 22:15.433
I deserve any of this.

22:15.467 --> 22:18.402
That's not what I was
going to say.

22:18.436 --> 22:20.671
Look, I may take some
of this for granted,

22:20.705 --> 22:22.706
but that is none
of your business.

22:22.741 --> 22:24.408
And you know what?

22:24.442 --> 22:25.876
Sooner or later this cut
is going to heal.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.679
What's your point?

22:27.713 --> 22:31.684
Well, when I take my life back,

22:31.718 --> 22:34.854
something tells me
that you're hoping

22:34.889 --> 22:37.690
I'll find a way to let you
stick around.

22:37.725 --> 22:40.460
And believe it or not,

22:40.494 --> 22:42.629
it's what I want, too.

22:43.664 --> 22:45.632
Really?

22:45.666 --> 22:46.701
Are you kidding?

22:46.835 --> 22:49.303
Oh, Emma, that would
be the greatest.

22:55.456 --> 22:58.056
Emma, are you sure
this is a decaf moka?

22:58.957 --> 23:00.958
Because I swear I can
taste caffeine in it.

23:00.992 --> 23:02.259
Oh, yes, it's decaf.

23:02.294 --> 23:04.929
I even yelled at the barista
like you told me to.

23:04.963 --> 23:07.898
Are you sure this is the safest
place for you to be right now?

23:07.932 --> 23:09.934
Yeah. Dan's at his trailer

23:09.968 --> 23:11.969
and thayer's staying with me
later at the cabin,

23:12.004 --> 23:15.273
but until then, I need to...

23:15.307 --> 23:20.112
Okay, that dress is so not
working for you.

23:20.146 --> 23:22.381
Excuse me?

23:22.415 --> 23:25.117
I mean, it's fine.

23:25.151 --> 23:30.289
It's just that this dress--
so much sexier.

23:30.323 --> 23:34.259
Okay, even if I wear
that dress, you do realize

23:34.294 --> 23:37.095
that it still won't
be you at that party?

23:37.130 --> 23:39.965
Mm, don't remind me.
(Knocking)

23:39.999 --> 23:42.334
Ted: Sutton, honey, you almost ready?
We're leaving soon.

23:42.369 --> 23:44.136
Be right there.

23:44.170 --> 23:46.138
Okay, I have to go.

23:46.172 --> 23:49.241
Please promise you will keep
a low profile this time.

It's prokofiev.

24:23.043 --> 24:26.345
Really? Because that just
sounds like a brand of vodka.

24:26.380 --> 24:29.982
Okay, I get it.

24:30.016 --> 24:33.185
Look, mads, I know
what you think of me.

24:33.219 --> 24:35.921
You and your friend Sutton
made it clear years ago.

24:35.955 --> 24:39.925
Rude, self-absorbed,
irresponsible...

24:39.959 --> 24:42.093
Yeah, but I've changed.

24:42.128 --> 24:45.930
Didn't you just get expelled for
putting a shark in a swimming pool?

24:45.965 --> 24:50.135
Okay, so sometimes
change can be incremental.

24:50.169 --> 24:51.236
Hmm.

24:56.041 --> 24:57.942

25:14.392 --> 25:17.227
And now I know.
Okay, I'll see you at home.

25:17.262 --> 25:19.930
No, no, no, no, no.

25:19.964 --> 25:21.667
Look, I know what
you're going through,

25:21.668 --> 25:23.800
but running home is not
going to solve anything.

25:24.201 --> 25:27.070
So what? I'm supposed to stay
here feeling like crap,

25:27.104 --> 25:28.938
putting on some big show
like everything's okay?

25:28.972 --> 25:32.175
Just... (Sighs)
See how things play out.

25:32.209 --> 25:34.210
You might be surprised.

25:38.316 --> 25:40.984
(Doorknob rattling)

25:45.223 --> 25:48.325
Hello?

25:48.360 --> 25:50.428
(Door creaking)

25:58.105 --> 26:00.072
Ah! Damn it!

26:06.280 --> 26:08.982
Do you mind if I hide out
here with you?

26:09.016 --> 26:10.719
The weird server with
the bacon-wrapped

26:10.720 --> 26:12.753
scallops just asked me
to go camping with him.

26:13.054 --> 26:15.088
Sure, Ms. Sewell.
Oh, please, Laurel,

26:15.122 --> 26:17.123
don't call me that.
Call me Rebecca.

26:17.157 --> 26:19.925
So are you enjoying
the music?

26:19.960 --> 26:23.129
Yeah. A couple of these
guys go to my school.

26:23.264 --> 26:25.033
I bought their album last year

26:25.034 --> 26:28.067
and played it for, like,
two months nonstop.

26:28.168 --> 26:30.970
Oh.
How did you hook this up?

26:31.004 --> 26:34.106
Oh, well, they recorded their
EP at my friend's studio.

26:34.140 --> 26:36.075
Oh. Cool.

26:36.109 --> 26:39.011
You know, I hope I'm not
overstepping my bounds here,

26:39.045 --> 26:40.913
but you're quite the
musical talent yourself.

26:40.947 --> 26:43.249
How did you know that?
I mean, not that I'm...

26:43.283 --> 26:46.918
I was eavesdropping on you
at your house the other day.

26:46.953 --> 26:50.056
- I heard you playing.
- Oh, God, I was singing, wasn't I?

26:50.090 --> 26:52.224
Yes, and quite well,
I might add.

26:52.259 --> 26:54.326
So why hasn't someone

26:54.361 --> 26:56.361
recorded your ep, yet?

26:56.396 --> 27:03.035
Well, for one, I love music
and performing--

27:03.069 --> 27:06.105
just not in front
of actual people.

27:06.139 --> 27:08.073
Disappointing to hear.

27:08.108 --> 27:09.274
Seems kind of selfish

27:09.309 --> 27:12.243
to keep all that talent to
yourself, don't you think?

27:14.213 --> 27:17.014
Just saying.

27:39.139 --> 27:42.074
Pff! Thayer.

27:42.108 --> 27:44.943
Thayer. I'm sorry. I know
I shouldn't have come here,

27:44.977 --> 27:46.946
but I was so scared, I didn't
know where else to go.

27:46.981 --> 27:50.282
It's okay, it's okay.
Your head's bleeding again.

27:50.316 --> 27:52.150
Oh, it happened when
I was getting away.

27:52.184 --> 27:54.052
Did you see who broke in?
No.

27:54.086 --> 27:56.955
I thought it was Laurel coming back
from the party or something, but...

27:56.989 --> 27:58.792
Listen, you did the
right thing, okay,

27:58.793 --> 28:01.026
but we really need to
get you out of here.

28:01.127 --> 28:03.895
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

28:03.930 --> 28:05.897
Okay, where are
we going to go?

28:05.931 --> 28:07.966
We'll think of someplace.
Come on.

28:09.201 --> 28:13.871
Kristin: Sutton.
Honey, what are you doing out here?

28:13.906 --> 28:15.906
Are you... are you
feeling sick again?

28:17.108 --> 28:19.243
No, no, she's good.
We're good.

28:19.278 --> 28:21.012
I'll see you inside.

28:21.046 --> 28:22.346
Sutton, what's going on?

28:22.381 --> 28:25.984
Have you
been drinking?

28:26.018 --> 28:28.286
No.

28:28.321 --> 28:30.122
I want you to turn around

28:30.156 --> 28:32.357
so that I can see
everything is okay.

28:39.032 --> 28:42.367
Oh, my God.
I just fell and hit my head.

28:42.402 --> 28:44.269
Everything's fine.

28:44.304 --> 28:46.973
In fact,

28:47.007 --> 28:49.976
I feel great.

28:54.105 --> 28:55.806
Ooh, this is a nasty cut.

28:55.841 --> 28:57.074
How did you say
this happened again?

28:57.108 --> 29:00.944
I was... walking to my car

29:00.978 --> 29:03.980
to get a lipstick, and
I tripped on the curb.

29:04.015 --> 29:06.049
Could blame the heels,

29:06.083 --> 29:08.751
but it's just
me being clumsy.

29:08.785 --> 29:11.053
Here, Rebecca found this
in the medicine cabinet.

29:11.088 --> 29:12.188
(Paper ripping)

29:12.222 --> 29:14.991
Okay.

29:15.025 --> 29:17.060
Hold still.

29:17.094 --> 29:18.761
Ow!
Okay.

29:18.796 --> 29:20.997
(Sighs)
Hold still.

29:21.032 --> 29:22.732
(Groans)
There you go.

29:22.767 --> 29:24.134
Are we done?

29:24.169 --> 29:26.169
For now, but I'm sure
your dad's gonna want

29:26.204 --> 29:28.872
to take a closer look
at that when we get home.

29:28.907 --> 29:30.007
Great.

29:30.041 --> 29:32.009
Well, I promise
to be more careful,

29:32.043 --> 29:34.145
but right now,
there's something I need to do.

29:34.179 --> 29:35.846
Thank you.

29:35.881 --> 29:37.982
Okay.

29:38.016 --> 29:39.150
(Sighs)

29:39.184 --> 29:41.152
Emily:
<i>Wait, you want us</i>

29:41.186 --> 29:42.853
to change clothes now?

29:42.887 --> 29:44.955
Yes. What else would you do?

29:44.990 --> 29:46.891
Her parents just saw the cut.

29:46.925 --> 29:48.025
A lot of people did.

29:48.060 --> 29:49.126
To everybody at that party,

29:49.160 --> 29:50.795
Sutton is Sutton again.

29:50.829 --> 29:52.897
And you are just...

29:52.931 --> 29:54.966
Well...

29:55.000 --> 29:56.967
Anyway, we knew it had
to end, right?

29:57.002 --> 29:58.903
So...

29:58.937 --> 30:02.039
If you don't mind, could we
please just change clothes

30:02.073 --> 30:04.174
before whoever wrote that note
tries to kill both of us?

30:04.209 --> 30:06.243
Okay, yeah.

30:06.277 --> 30:08.011
Hm?

30:08.046 --> 30:09.813
(Shutter clicks)

30:09.847 --> 30:11.181
Laurel.

30:11.215 --> 30:13.217
How are you doing, sweetie,
are you all right?

30:13.251 --> 30:14.918
Actually, um, if it's okay,

30:14.952 --> 30:16.887
I think I'm gonna head
home for the night.

30:16.921 --> 30:18.888
I get it.

30:18.923 --> 30:20.923
Baz: All right, can I have
your attention, everyone?

30:20.958 --> 30:23.259
Okay, okay, for this next one,
we're actually gonna need

30:23.293 --> 30:25.261
a little help up here.

30:25.295 --> 30:28.997
As it turns out, my good friend,
our mentor, Rebecca Sewell,

30:29.031 --> 30:30.898
has just informed me that
there is someone out here

30:30.933 --> 30:32.233
who might be able
to give us a hand.

30:32.267 --> 30:33.834
Now, I'm not gonna

30:33.869 --> 30:35.169
embarrass her by
saying any names,

30:35.203 --> 30:37.971
but if she'd be willing
to come up and join us...

30:43.945 --> 30:46.981
(Crowd cheers)

30:52.155 --> 30:54.156
What song are we playing?

30:54.190 --> 30:55.958
Do you know "what
money paid for"?

30:55.992 --> 30:57.126
Yeah.

I prefer the slow ones.

32:32.155 --> 32:34.056
♪ Over land, over sea ♪

32:34.090 --> 32:36.825
♪ they'll threaten you as far
as their guns can reach ♪

32:36.859 --> 32:38.894
Alec Rybek,

32:38.928 --> 32:41.831
♪ don't think about it ♪
- are you asking me to dance with you?

32:41.865 --> 32:44.233
♪ Or what allowed it ♪

32:44.268 --> 32:47.270

32:59.051 --> 33:00.851

33:00.886 --> 33:03.120
500 bucks?

33:03.155 --> 33:06.156
Ryan, I've been waiting to
win these tickets all night.

33:06.191 --> 33:09.226
So what do you want me to do,
just cross it out?

33:09.260 --> 33:11.828
Actually, yes, that's exactly
what I want you to do.

33:11.862 --> 33:14.797
And deprive myself the pleasure
of funding the arts?

33:14.832 --> 33:17.233
That's kind of selfish,
don't you think?

33:17.267 --> 33:19.068
Look, I know
you're doing this

33:19.102 --> 33:20.936
'cause you think it's
charming or whatever,

33:20.971 --> 33:23.239
but throwing around your
daddy's money isn't cute.

33:23.273 --> 33:25.875
In fact, it just makes
people feel sorry for you.

33:30.214 --> 33:31.982
(Music ends)

33:32.016 --> 33:33.851
(Cheering)

33:38.223 --> 33:41.126
Ted:
Laurel!

33:47.165 --> 33:50.001
So, I checked
all the windows and doors.

33:50.035 --> 33:52.937
I know Sutton said
someone broke in.

33:52.971 --> 33:57.174
You don't think
she's making it up?

33:57.208 --> 33:59.176
At this point,
who knows?

34:01.179 --> 34:02.946
So that's it, I guess.

34:02.981 --> 34:06.083
Sutton's got her life back.

34:06.118 --> 34:08.085
Yeah.

34:08.119 --> 34:11.121
Kind of hard
to believe.

34:11.156 --> 34:14.958
I'm just... me again.

34:17.161 --> 34:19.196
Emma Becker.

34:19.230 --> 34:22.232
And you're okay with that?

34:22.266 --> 34:25.135
Relieved, mostly.

34:27.005 --> 34:28.906
It was fun
while it lasted.

34:28.940 --> 34:29.907
Some of it.

34:29.942 --> 34:32.976
But...

34:34.980 --> 34:37.915
But all in all,

34:37.949 --> 34:40.985
I got out with
everything I needed.

34:52.780 --> 34:54.246
You're home late.

34:56.150 --> 34:59.151
Saw you talking
to Ryan harwell.

34:59.186 --> 35:01.220
Something going on there?

35:01.254 --> 35:03.188
Oh, he wishes.

35:03.222 --> 35:04.989
Exotic accent,

35:05.024 --> 35:08.226
cool car, heir to
a frozen dinner empire.

35:08.260 --> 35:10.194
I always thought
you and your friends

35:10.228 --> 35:12.930
would be into that,
especially Sutton.

35:12.965 --> 35:15.132
Sutton hates him and his accent.

35:15.167 --> 35:18.770
(British accent): She thinks
he sounds like Mary poppins.

35:18.804 --> 35:21.006
Okay, so what do you think?

35:21.040 --> 35:23.908
(Sighs)

35:23.942 --> 35:26.844
So, you kind of
disappeared tonight.

35:26.879 --> 35:28.179
Yeah, sorry about that.

35:28.213 --> 35:29.981
There was kind of a situation.

35:30.015 --> 35:31.783
Sutton told me she fell.

35:31.817 --> 35:33.017
Did you see her head?

35:33.052 --> 35:35.186
Yeah, yeah. I think
she'll be all right, though.

35:36.289 --> 35:38.123
Well, off to bed.

35:40.159 --> 35:41.893
Oh, I almost forgot.

35:41.928 --> 35:43.261
Did you order a pizza?

35:43.295 --> 35:44.262
No.

35:44.296 --> 35:45.863
Guy delivered
one for you,

35:45.898 --> 35:47.198
said it was already paid for.

35:54.006 --> 35:56.007
(Chuckles)

35:58.878 --> 36:00.846
(Cell phone vibrating)

36:04.785 --> 36:06.886
Mads:
<i>Hello?</i>

36:06.920 --> 36:08.188
So did you get my pizza?

36:08.222 --> 36:09.989
I did.

36:10.024 --> 36:11.224
Yeah, I, uh,

36:11.258 --> 36:12.925
wasn't sure
what toppings you liked,

36:12.960 --> 36:14.127
so I went with cheese

36:14.161 --> 36:17.096
and ridiculously expensive
ballet tickets.

36:17.130 --> 36:18.198
Cute.

36:18.232 --> 36:21.033
Look, mads,
you were right earlier.

36:21.068 --> 36:22.836
I do come on too strong,

36:22.870 --> 36:24.204
especially when
I want something.

36:24.238 --> 36:29.042
I can be rude,
immature, impatient,

36:29.076 --> 36:32.212
and sometimes I throw
my father's money around,

36:32.246 --> 36:35.181
which is completely obnoxious.

36:35.216 --> 36:38.952
Anyway, the tickets are yours.

36:38.986 --> 36:41.020
Really?

36:41.055 --> 36:42.789
What happened
to loving the arts?

36:42.823 --> 36:45.191
Yeah, that's completely untrue.

36:45.226 --> 36:47.227
Truth is,
I kind of hate the arts.

36:47.261 --> 36:49.763
(Laughs)

36:49.798 --> 36:50.931
Anyway, it's late,

36:50.965 --> 36:53.867
so I'll let you go.

36:53.901 --> 36:55.936
Ryan, wait.

36:55.970 --> 36:57.170
Yeah?

36:57.205 --> 36:59.941
Well, look,
the ballet is next week,

36:59.975 --> 37:03.010
and char, the person
I normally go with,

37:03.045 --> 37:05.947
isn't here, so...

37:05.981 --> 37:09.784
Um, if you'd have any desire
to go with me

37:09.818 --> 37:10.851
as friends...

37:10.886 --> 37:13.120
That's great.

37:13.154 --> 37:14.955
We'll have an amazing time.

37:14.990 --> 37:16.223
I'll-I'll make reservations

37:16.258 --> 37:19.193
so we can have dinner before,
anywhere you want.

37:19.227 --> 37:21.895
Mm, you did hear
the "as friends" part, right?

37:21.930 --> 37:23.864
Sorry, mads,
you're-you're cutting out.

37:23.898 --> 37:24.998
Ryan?

37:26.133 --> 37:28.134
Hello?

37:31.139 --> 37:32.973
(Sighs)

37:33.008 --> 37:34.141
Thanks.

37:34.176 --> 37:36.177
I was kind of nervous,
but yeah.

37:36.211 --> 37:37.879
Anyway, have a good night.

37:37.913 --> 37:39.047
Night.

37:39.081 --> 37:40.915
See you, Laurel.

37:42.118 --> 37:45.253
Justin, what are you doing?

37:45.288 --> 37:48.089
I would've called, but I
knew you wouldn't answer.

37:48.123 --> 37:51.859
Laurel, that girl you saw me
with tonight means nothing.

37:51.893 --> 37:55.196
And truth is, hasn't
been anybody else.

37:55.230 --> 37:57.799
Great.

37:57.833 --> 38:00.101
Is that supposed to
sweep me off my feet?

38:00.135 --> 38:01.735
Justin, something

38:01.770 --> 38:03.904
amazing happened to me tonight.

38:03.938 --> 38:06.039
I got up in front of a crowd
and sang.

38:06.073 --> 38:07.073
People applauded.

38:07.108 --> 38:08.908
I know.

38:08.943 --> 38:11.745
I was watching
from inside the house.

38:11.779 --> 38:12.746
You were amazing.

38:12.780 --> 38:15.215
You want to do me a favor?

38:15.249 --> 38:16.917
Stop messing with me.

38:16.952 --> 38:19.086
All these lies,

38:19.121 --> 38:20.788
the cryptic comments,

38:20.823 --> 38:22.090
all this weird crap
between you and my dad.

38:22.124 --> 38:25.093
I know. I should...

38:25.128 --> 38:27.029
Probably just tell you
the truth.

38:27.063 --> 38:28.898
Probably?

38:28.932 --> 38:30.933
Justin, you owe me the truth!

38:30.968 --> 38:32.234
In fact, you know what?

38:32.269 --> 38:34.170
This is it.
This is your chance.

38:34.204 --> 38:37.807
Tell me what's going on
or get the hell out of my life.

38:42.981 --> 38:46.217
Your dad killed my mom.

38:46.251 --> 38:48.753
Okay?

38:48.788 --> 38:49.854
What?

38:49.889 --> 38:52.758
She was one of his patients.

38:52.792 --> 38:54.826
I was, uh,
I was a kid.

38:54.861 --> 38:58.765
One night, we were having dinner
and she wasn't feeling well.

38:58.799 --> 39:01.167
Wound up in the E.R.

39:01.201 --> 39:03.903
Turns out, it was her appendix.

39:03.938 --> 39:07.174
Justin, people die on the
operating table all the time.

39:07.208 --> 39:08.842
That doesn't mean my dad...

39:08.876 --> 39:10.043
No.

39:10.077 --> 39:12.812
He screwed up.

39:12.847 --> 39:14.147
The surgery was just
a routine scope.

39:14.181 --> 39:16.049
She was supposed
to be fine.

39:16.083 --> 39:18.117
But everyone in the
O.R. that night said

39:18.151 --> 39:20.052
something about your
dad wasn't right.

39:20.086 --> 39:22.087
Apparently, he got a call,

39:22.122 --> 39:26.758
and after that, he was,
he was nervous, distracted.

39:26.793 --> 39:28.860
Afterwards, my mom
was in the recovery room,

39:28.895 --> 39:30.195
and they noticed
she wasn't breathing.

39:30.230 --> 39:32.831
They tried paging your
dad, but he wasn't there.

39:32.866 --> 39:34.767
No one could find him.

39:34.801 --> 39:36.802
Turns out, he didn't stick
around for the whole surgery.

39:36.837 --> 39:38.004
Left some intern to close up

39:38.038 --> 39:40.107
while he rushed off
to God knows where.

39:40.141 --> 39:42.042
Still, it was an accident.

39:42.077 --> 39:44.044
That's what they said.

39:44.079 --> 39:48.182
He accidentally nicked
the iliac artery.

39:48.217 --> 39:50.017
But if that's the truth,

39:50.052 --> 39:52.753
then why they were so quick
to settle out of court?

39:52.787 --> 39:54.855
And, you know,
by that point,

39:54.889 --> 39:57.124
my dad, he was,
he was so drunk all the time,

39:57.158 --> 39:59.026
he didn't even know
what he was signing.

39:59.060 --> 40:03.162
So, wait, your-your parents
didn't die in a car crash?

40:05.232 --> 40:08.067
Which means you came
to Phoenix to, what,

40:08.101 --> 40:10.770
get some sort of revenge
on my dad?

40:13.106 --> 40:15.207
Oh, God.

40:15.242 --> 40:16.976
It wasn't an accident

40:17.010 --> 40:19.144
that you met me in the park
that day, was it?

40:19.178 --> 40:22.747
There's so much
I have to explain to you.

40:22.781 --> 40:24.849
If you just, if you just
hear me out...

40:24.883 --> 40:26.117
No!

40:26.151 --> 40:28.953
Who are you?

40:28.987 --> 40:31.022
Is your name even Justin Miller?

40:31.056 --> 40:34.793
I lied to you
about a lot of stuff.

40:34.828 --> 40:36.896
I didn't think
I had a choice.

40:36.930 --> 40:38.931
You always had a choice.

40:38.966 --> 40:41.167
I know that now.

40:41.202 --> 40:43.937
Just please
can I explain to you...

40:43.971 --> 40:45.806
No.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.107
I want you to go.

40:48.843 --> 40:50.777
Before I call the cops.

40:58.853 --> 41:00.053
Rebecca: Alec.
Yeah?

41:00.088 --> 41:01.889
What are you doing?

41:01.923 --> 41:04.959
We have a cleaning crew coming
in the morning for this.

41:04.994 --> 41:06.160
That's all right.

41:06.195 --> 41:08.729
I'm happy to help.

41:08.763 --> 41:10.064
(Laughs)

41:10.098 --> 41:11.799
What?

41:11.833 --> 41:13.968
I don't know.
It's just, the Alec rybak

41:14.002 --> 41:15.803
that I knew in high school
was a lot better

41:15.837 --> 41:17.805
at making messes
than cleaning them up.

41:17.839 --> 41:19.206
Yeah, well, now it
seems like I spent

41:19.240 --> 41:21.976
half my adult life cleaning up
other people's messes, so...

41:22.010 --> 41:24.979
And they say
people don't change.

41:25.013 --> 41:27.748
Hmm.

41:27.782 --> 41:29.750
Listen, Rebecca, there's
something we need to talk about,

41:29.784 --> 41:31.185
something that's been
bothering me a little bit.

41:31.219 --> 41:34.187
Alec, what did I say earlier?

41:35.891 --> 41:37.191
I don't want to talk
about this stuff.

41:37.225 --> 41:39.861
Understood.

41:39.895 --> 41:41.229
It's just that
we both know

41:41.263 --> 41:44.866
what kind of guy I
used to be, and, uh...

41:44.900 --> 41:48.804
I know I was reckless,
and a bit of a bully.

41:48.838 --> 41:50.139
We have two choices here.

41:50.173 --> 41:52.741
We can keep talking
about this,

41:52.776 --> 41:55.844
you apologizing and dredging up

41:55.879 --> 41:59.716
all kinds of painful memories...

41:59.750 --> 42:01.818
Or what?

42:01.853 --> 42:05.155
Or we could start fresh

42:05.189 --> 42:07.792
and see where it takes us.

42:12.063 --> 42:14.765
Doesn't that sound like
a lot more fun?

42:23.040 --> 42:25.207
Kristin:
<i>How amazing was Laurel?</i>

42:25.242 --> 42:26.208
<i>We always knew</i>

42:26.243 --> 42:27.910
she had a lovely voice,

42:27.944 --> 42:30.045
but she was just so shy
about performing.

42:30.079 --> 42:31.079
Yeah, I know.

42:31.113 --> 42:32.781
Where did that
come from?

42:32.815 --> 42:35.049
Now, you, young
lady, you're lucky.

42:35.083 --> 42:36.884
It's not going
to leave a scar.

42:36.919 --> 42:39.020
Are you sure
you got that tonight?

42:39.054 --> 42:42.123
Yeah. Why?

42:42.157 --> 42:44.792
'Cause judging from
the healing patterns,

42:44.826 --> 42:47.027
it looks like you've had it
for a couple of days.

42:47.062 --> 42:48.829
Oh.

42:48.863 --> 42:52.699
Well, I just heal very quickly.

42:52.733 --> 42:53.900
I saved you a piece

42:53.934 --> 42:56.703
of white velvet
cake-- your favorite.

42:56.737 --> 42:58.938
Thank you. It looks great.

42:58.972 --> 43:00.106
You gonna eat that
in front of us?

43:00.140 --> 43:01.774
Or you gonna share
with your father?

43:01.808 --> 43:03.008
I don't know. You're looking

43:03.043 --> 43:05.711
a little bit thicker
than I last remember.

43:05.745 --> 43:06.945
Ted:
Listen to you.

43:06.979 --> 43:09.147
Coming from my daughter
who looks like rocky balboa.

43:09.182 --> 43:11.183
