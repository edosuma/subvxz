<i>Before there was sex...</i>

00:02.118 --> 00:04.796
<i>Before there was the city,</i>
<i>there was just me,</i>

00:04.916 --> 00:07.803
<i>Carrie... Carrie Bradshaw</i>
<i>from Castlebury, Connecticut.</i>

00:07.923 --> 00:09.823
You seriously didn't have
to come see me off.

00:09.825 --> 00:10.957
I'm crazy about you.

00:10.959 --> 00:12.025
I'm Samantha.

00:12.027 --> 00:13.460
I'm having sex with your husband.
(Crying)

00:13.462 --> 00:14.661
Feels like you haven't totally

00:14.663 --> 00:15.996
worked out
the open marriage thing.

00:15.998 --> 00:18.098
I like you, which means
I don't wanna share you.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.233
You're engaged? To who?
To Harlan.

00:20.235 --> 00:21.968
You have a job
at “Interview” Magazine.

00:21.970 --> 00:23.570
But I'm going to N.Y.U.
in the fall.

00:23.572 --> 00:25.372
Why waste four years
in order to get a job

00:25.374 --> 00:26.706
that you've already been given?

00:26.708 --> 00:28.341
Take the job.
You were born to write.

00:28.343 --> 00:29.943
You always were wonderful
with words.

00:29.945 --> 00:31.278
You are throwing away college.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.113
And if you get fired,
what will you do then?

00:33.115 --> 00:34.814
- Well, I don't know but...
- What <i>do</i> you know?

00:34.816 --> 00:36.182
I know that I'm taking the job!

00:36.184 --> 00:37.651
I need to
follow my dreams, too.

00:37.653 --> 00:38.718
I'm going to California.

00:38.720 --> 00:39.786
(Bottles clink)

00:39.788 --> 00:40.887
Thank you
for being here for me.

00:40.889 --> 00:43.023
Of course. Always.

01:22.897 --> 01:24.297
I kinda can't believe <i>I</i> did it.

01:24.299 --> 01:25.531
Pretty sure you were a given.

01:25.533 --> 01:27.567
Oh, it's so weird to think
in just a few months,

01:27.569 --> 01:29.335
we'll all be scattered
across the globe.

01:29.337 --> 01:31.003
And you, my friend,
leave in a week.

01:31.005 --> 01:32.438
I know, but just for the city.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.940
With a job and a paycheck,

01:33.942 --> 01:35.508
living in
your hot boyfriend's loft.

01:35.510 --> 01:37.543
Only for a few weeks until
I find my own place to live.

01:37.545 --> 01:39.912
- Either way, totally cool.
- Well, tell that to my dad.

01:39.914 --> 01:41.948
- He hasn't dropped the silent treatment?
- Nope.

01:41.950 --> 01:43.149
Who would've guessed
<i>your</i> dad would be

01:43.151 --> 01:44.217
the understanding one?

01:44.219 --> 01:45.518
I am as surprised as anyone.

01:45.520 --> 01:47.286
Who knew he would
take the news so well

01:47.288 --> 01:48.254
that I'm going to Pratt?

01:48.256 --> 01:49.822
Maybe our dads switched brains.

01:49.824 --> 01:51.724
I'm just excited
you'll be in the city with me.

01:51.726 --> 01:52.925
Stop making me jealous.

01:52.927 --> 01:55.227
Oh, please, you're gonna be
20 minutes away

01:55.229 --> 01:56.829
from your macho military man.

01:56.831 --> 01:59.031
While I'll be hours and hours
away from everyone

01:59.033 --> 02:01.100
slaving away
at the most prestigious college

02:01.102 --> 02:02.802
in the country
all by my lonesome.

02:02.804 --> 02:04.470
Oy, vey.
Let the pity party begin.

02:04.472 --> 02:05.971
Hi, Mr. London!

02:05.973 --> 02:07.306
Hey, kids.

02:07.308 --> 02:09.108
So, Mouse, you're needed
for pictures with the faculty.

02:09.110 --> 02:10.175
Are you ready?

02:10.178 --> 02:11.644
Yes, I'm ready for my moment.

02:11.646 --> 02:12.812
West's moment as well.

02:12.814 --> 02:14.013
As co-valedictorians,

02:14.015 --> 02:15.548
you'll both be
in the annual picture.

02:15.550 --> 02:18.183
Right. Of course.
I'll be right there.

02:18.185 --> 02:19.852
Hey, what are the odds
that you guys would

02:19.854 --> 02:22.688
get the same G.P.A.
down to the decimal point?

02:22.690 --> 02:24.657
3%. Ugh.

02:24.659 --> 02:26.025
Be back soon.

02:26.027 --> 02:27.760
I'm so proud of you!
Hi!

02:27.762 --> 02:30.295
(Laughs) And you
looked gorgeous up there.

02:30.297 --> 02:31.015
Thanks!

02:31.135 --> 02:32.936
I am one of the few people that can
pull off maroon and gold.

02:33.056 --> 02:33.900
Oh, oh!

02:34.020 --> 02:36.235
That's so funny, babe.
Isn't she the greatest?

02:36.237 --> 02:37.803
- She is.
- The best.

02:37.805 --> 02:39.271
I heard someone say
“The best.”

02:39.273 --> 02:40.439
are you talking about me?

02:40.441 --> 02:42.141
No, actually, we were
talking about me.

02:42.143 --> 02:43.642
Whoa, look at you
and your newfound

02:43.644 --> 02:44.968
sense of confidence. I like
this new Maggie.

02:45.088 --> 02:45.960
Me, too.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.980
- Did we just agree on something?
- Yeah.

02:47.982 --> 02:50.349
But don't worry.
We won't tell anyone.

02:50.351 --> 02:51.884
(Camera shutter clicking) <i> While
it was warm between some,</i>

02:51.886 --> 02:54.786
<i>it was definitely cooler</i>
<i>among others.</i>

02:54.788 --> 02:56.722
Okay, so I think
we have that one.

02:56.724 --> 02:58.290
Great.
Glad that's over.

02:58.292 --> 03:00.692
- I mean, glad you got the photo.
- Yeah, same.

03:00.694 --> 03:02.194
Well, congratulations, you two.

03:02.196 --> 03:03.195
As you both know,

03:03.197 --> 03:05.330
the valedictorian's awarded
a gift...

03:05.332 --> 03:07.366
In your case,
co-valedictorians.

03:07.368 --> 03:09.601
Yes, I am very excited.

03:09.603 --> 03:11.670
We will reach out to you
when your gift arrives.

03:11.672 --> 03:13.138
Terrific. Can't wait.

03:16.042 --> 03:19.044
So, congratulations.

03:19.046 --> 03:21.880
To you, too.

03:21.882 --> 03:23.615
I heard you're going
to Princeton.

03:23.617 --> 03:26.051
Yeah. I have a shot
to play basketball there.

03:26.053 --> 03:27.919
That's great.

03:31.390 --> 03:33.625
Well, it was... good
to see you.

03:33.627 --> 03:34.793
Definitely.

03:34.795 --> 03:36.528
Good luck at school.

03:36.530 --> 03:38.096
You, too.

03:41.233 --> 03:43.468
Well, that was...

03:43.470 --> 03:44.836
(Tom) Awkward.

03:44.838 --> 03:47.439
You winning the Dr. Daniel Banes
Book Scholarship Award,

03:47.441 --> 03:49.941
since you won't be needing
books this year.

03:49.943 --> 03:51.976
- You're not taking this?
- No, you can have it.

03:51.978 --> 03:53.745
Since you won't be
going to college.

03:53.747 --> 03:55.780
Yeah, yeah. We all know
you're disappointed.

03:55.782 --> 03:58.183
But can you just lay off today?
She just graduated.

03:58.185 --> 03:59.450
Thank you.

03:59.452 --> 04:01.085
Although, are you just
being nice to me

04:01.087 --> 04:02.487
because you wanna
move into my room?

04:02.489 --> 04:04.956
That and you looked so hideous
in that cap and gown,

04:04.958 --> 04:07.258
I didn't want the day
to get any worse for you.

04:07.260 --> 04:08.493
Aw, that was sweet of you.

04:08.495 --> 04:10.161
I thought she looked great
in that cap and gown...

04:10.163 --> 04:11.496
So much so that I'd like
to see her in another one

04:11.498 --> 04:12.597
in four years.

04:12.599 --> 04:14.732
It is only June.

04:14.734 --> 04:16.733
Maybe you can still
get your spot at N.Y.U.?

04:16.736 --> 04:18.903
Dad, she is not
going to change her mind.

04:18.904 --> 04:20.838
I took the job
at “Interview.”

04:20.839 --> 04:21.939
I know I'm on my own.

04:21.940 --> 04:23.741
But hopefully,
you can believe in me

04:23.743 --> 04:25.376
and the decisions I've made.

04:25.378 --> 04:28.146
I can't.

04:28.148 --> 04:31.816
Because I truly feel that
you are ruining your future,

04:31.818 --> 04:36.053
and I will not condone that.

04:41.493 --> 04:43.327
Don't worry.

04:43.329 --> 04:45.596
He can't stay mad
at you forever.

04:45.598 --> 04:46.797
You're his favorite.

04:46.799 --> 04:50.701
His favorite daughter to be mad at.
(Chuckles)

04:50.703 --> 04:53.304
Will you at least be
nice to him when I'm gone?

04:53.306 --> 04:55.172
I'll try, but I can't promise.

04:55.174 --> 04:57.942
I'm still me, after all.

05:03.281 --> 05:07.451
<i>It was time</i>
<i>to put away childish things...</i>

05:09.521 --> 05:13.224
<i>and become a working girl.</i>

05:13.226 --> 05:15.492
Thank you.

05:15.494 --> 05:16.894
You ready for the big day?

05:16.896 --> 05:18.228
Um, I think so.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.396
I'm trying to read up
on everything

05:19.398 --> 05:21.699
so I have ideas to pitch
when I get in.

05:21.701 --> 05:25.636
Ah, there's an article
in here about Larissa.

05:25.638 --> 05:26.837
What about?

05:26.839 --> 05:28.906
They are calling her
a modern day Medici,

05:28.908 --> 05:32.476
a benefactor to the burgeoning
art scene in the city.

05:32.478 --> 05:33.444
Oh, get this.

05:33.446 --> 05:35.212
“With Harlan's money
and my taste,

05:35.214 --> 05:37.447
we're going to take
the art world by storm”"

05:37.449 --> 05:39.883
(chuckles) I can't believe
that I work for someone

05:39.885 --> 05:41.585
who has articles
written about her

05:41.587 --> 05:44.354
in the “Arts and Leisure”
section of the paper of record.

05:44.356 --> 05:45.722
That can only be good for you,

05:45.724 --> 05:47.057
having your wagon
hitched to hers.

05:47.059 --> 05:48.258
I mean, look at us.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.793
We're making it big
in this crazy city.

05:49.795 --> 05:52.896
Well, my stuff's more
in California,

05:52.898 --> 05:55.799
and I may need to think
about being there more.

05:55.801 --> 05:58.001
Yeah, of course.
I mean, I figured as much.

05:58.003 --> 06:00.904
Maybe I can pitch story ideas
so I have to head out there

06:00.906 --> 06:02.072
for a few days.

06:02.074 --> 06:04.007
And then we can take
our trips together.

06:04.009 --> 06:05.776
Sure. Yeah.

06:05.778 --> 06:06.943
(Mug thuds) Well, I gotta go.

06:06.945 --> 06:08.812
I don't wanna be late
on my first day.

06:08.814 --> 06:11.681
Have so much fun, Bradshaw.

06:11.683 --> 06:13.850
I will do my best, Kydd.

06:23.527 --> 06:24.694
(Ollie barks)

06:24.696 --> 06:26.496
I know. I have to tell her.

06:26.498 --> 06:28.765
<i>While Sebastian</i>
<i>was feeling guilty,</i>

06:28.767 --> 06:32.469
<i>Samantha was feeling lucky.</i>

06:32.471 --> 06:34.337
Samantha, hey.

06:34.339 --> 06:38.074
Elliot.
Well, what a surprise.

06:38.076 --> 06:39.075
How are you?

06:39.077 --> 06:40.610
You know, hanging in.

06:40.612 --> 06:42.679
Well, good for you.
Hang in there, baby.

06:42.681 --> 06:43.913
I'm running a bit late, so...

06:43.915 --> 06:46.149
You gotta get in there
for a race?

06:46.151 --> 06:47.684
How do you know I'm here
to bet on a horse?

06:47.686 --> 06:49.986
We're in front of
the O.T.B.

06:49.988 --> 06:52.222
And a deli
and a hair center for men.

06:52.224 --> 06:54.457
You told me you
come up here and bet.

06:54.459 --> 06:56.893
I love the idea
that betting relaxes you.

06:56.895 --> 06:58.661
It did until you showed up.

06:58.663 --> 07:00.863
Look, I've been thinking
about you a lot.

07:00.865 --> 07:02.699
I was hoping to find you.
I don't know where you live.

07:02.701 --> 07:04.067
Very few people do.

07:04.069 --> 07:05.201
But...

07:05.203 --> 07:06.602
I needed to see you.

07:06.604 --> 07:10.606
So, I might've been hanging out
here in between my classes.

07:10.608 --> 07:13.109
N.Y.U. is 60 blocks away.

07:13.111 --> 07:15.178
Are you stalking me?

07:15.180 --> 07:17.280
Maybe?

07:17.282 --> 07:18.481
You're married.

07:18.483 --> 07:20.550
And I told you,
I can't see you.

07:20.552 --> 07:21.918
I know. I know.

07:21.920 --> 07:23.386
I don't understand
what's happening to me.

07:23.388 --> 07:26.155
I-I'm a scientist.
I know that sex

07:26.157 --> 07:27.890
is a purely physical act.

07:27.892 --> 07:30.293
But with you,
it's... it's more.

07:30.295 --> 07:31.794
It's like I crave you.

07:31.796 --> 07:35.798
I keep searching for this
biological explanation,

07:35.800 --> 07:37.166
but there's none.

07:38.635 --> 07:41.237
I don't know what to do.

07:41.239 --> 07:43.806
I do.

07:43.808 --> 07:46.242
Why don't we go inside
and bet on some horses?

07:46.244 --> 07:47.777
Maybe it'll relax you.

07:57.854 --> 08:00.656
(Under breath)
Keep your head down.

08:00.658 --> 08:01.924
And, Lyle!

08:01.926 --> 08:04.193
Get me that cappuccino machine.
I paid for it.

08:04.195 --> 08:05.628
Well, I borrowed it
from a photo shoot,

08:05.630 --> 08:06.595
so it's mine.

08:06.597 --> 08:08.364
Everything good?
What are you doing?

08:08.366 --> 08:09.331
Need help?

08:09.333 --> 08:10.699
What does it look like
I'm doing?

08:10.701 --> 08:11.800
I'm clearing out my desk.

08:11.802 --> 08:13.502
But why?

08:13.504 --> 08:15.604
Because I've been fired.

08:15.606 --> 08:17.373
From “Interview”?

08:17.375 --> 08:19.508
No, darling, from Charivari.

08:19.510 --> 08:21.210
Of course from “Interview”"

08:21.212 --> 08:22.544
what the hell happened?

08:22.546 --> 08:24.780
Andy's fragile ego happened.

08:24.782 --> 08:28.183
The wigged wonder can't handle
anybody else in the limelight!

08:28.185 --> 08:30.252
You didn't mention him
in the piece?

08:30.254 --> 08:33.856
I just got so carried away
talking about me,

08:33.857 --> 08:35.123
that I forgot.

08:35.125 --> 08:36.491
Anyway, screw him.

08:36.494 --> 08:37.960
I don't need him
or his magazine.

08:37.962 --> 08:40.629
Well, what will you do?

08:40.631 --> 08:42.431
I'll... plan my wedding.

08:42.433 --> 08:45.400
Redecorate the apartment,
buy art, sell art!

08:45.402 --> 08:47.035
I was in the arts section
of “the New York Times”

08:47.037 --> 08:48.770
I can do anything.

08:48.772 --> 08:50.973
Yes, you... you totally can.

08:50.975 --> 08:53.742
Um, so...

08:53.744 --> 08:56.611
What will this,
uh, mean for me?

08:56.613 --> 08:58.313
Who will I be working for next?

08:58.315 --> 08:59.915
Oh, darling.
You're fired, too.

08:59.917 --> 09:02.884
When you hitch your wagon
to a star, well, you know.

09:02.886 --> 09:04.086
You fall when they do?

09:04.088 --> 09:06.788
I wouldn't exactly
say “fall.”

09:06.790 --> 09:09.691
but, yeah. In a nutshell.
(Object clatters)

09:09.693 --> 09:11.059
(Sighs)

09:16.788 --> 09:19.037
But if I-I could just
explain my... my situation,

09:19.157 --> 09:21.157
I think you... I-I am truly sorry, Ms.
Bradshaw.

09:21.159 --> 09:22.926
But unfortunately,
matriculating at N.Y.U.

09:22.928 --> 09:24.594
This fall is not an option.

09:24.596 --> 09:26.162
There are no slots.

09:26.164 --> 09:27.931
But you accepted me.
(Drawer closes)

09:27.933 --> 09:30.166
And you turned us down.

09:30.168 --> 09:32.369
Yes, but that was before
my circumstances had changed.

09:32.371 --> 09:34.437
You wanted me a month ago.
Don't you want me now?

09:34.439 --> 09:35.839
I'm a... I'm a really
hard worker.

09:35.841 --> 09:37.474
I am truly sorry, sweetie.

09:37.476 --> 09:39.709
But we went to
the wait-list last week.

09:39.711 --> 09:41.578
So I missed my shot by a week?

09:41.580 --> 09:42.912
Three days, actually.

09:42.914 --> 09:44.781
What should I do?

09:44.783 --> 09:49.152
Look, you... you can sit down
with the head of admissions

09:49.154 --> 09:50.787
and plead your case.

09:50.789 --> 09:52.188
Okay, great.

09:52.190 --> 09:53.556
And then maybe
you'll get in for spring,

09:53.558 --> 09:54.924
definitely for next year.

09:54.926 --> 09:59.228
Well, what am I supposed
to do for the next seven months?

09:59.230 --> 10:02.065
Get a job?

10:02.067 --> 10:03.466
Well, that's what caused

10:03.468 --> 10:05.635
this whole mess
in the first place.

10:05.637 --> 10:08.905
(Samantha and Elliot moaning
and breathing heavily)

10:16.947 --> 10:19.248
Well, that was a mistake.

10:19.250 --> 10:22.118
Oh. Is that what
a mistake sounds like?

10:22.120 --> 10:23.819
I always confuse that
with an orgasm.

10:23.821 --> 10:27.690
I meant that I had
the orgasm with you.

10:27.692 --> 10:30.626
There's nothing wrong
with what we're doing.

10:30.628 --> 10:33.195
I'm in an open marriage.
(Zips pants)

10:33.197 --> 10:34.497
Does your wife know
you stalked me?

10:34.499 --> 10:37.533
I prefer “Hang around
where you might be."

10:37.535 --> 10:39.969
Or that you think
about me all the time?

10:39.971 --> 10:42.071
No.

10:42.073 --> 10:44.740
Or that I think about you
all the time?

10:44.742 --> 10:45.841
You do?

10:45.843 --> 10:48.310
Look, I admit that
this is confusing,

10:48.312 --> 10:49.845
but I don't want to let you go.

10:49.847 --> 10:53.149
Well, too bad, buddy,
'cause I am outta here.

10:53.151 --> 10:54.550
I don't do commitment,

10:54.552 --> 10:57.019
especially not with someone
who's already committed.

10:57.021 --> 11:00.856
My mom did that enough
for the both of us.

11:00.858 --> 11:02.224
Well, Elliot...

11:02.226 --> 11:03.726
it was nice to see you,

11:03.728 --> 11:06.061
and I hope I never
have the pleasure again.

11:06.063 --> 11:07.730
Wait, wait, I...
I know what you're doing.

11:07.732 --> 11:08.864
Leaving.

11:08.866 --> 11:10.766
You're trying to run
away from me.

11:10.768 --> 11:12.868
I'm just trying to walk out
of your apartment.

11:12.870 --> 11:14.470
No, it's a biological
imperative.

11:14.472 --> 11:15.971
When the body has
an adrenaline rush,

11:15.973 --> 11:18.407
it stimulates your desire
for fight or flight.

11:18.409 --> 11:19.742
It's totally natural.

11:19.744 --> 11:21.643
Well, if it's totally natural,
then bye-bye I fly.

11:21.645 --> 11:24.279
You don't have to race
out of here.

11:24.281 --> 11:25.747
(Sighs)

11:25.749 --> 11:27.950
You could stay and fight.

11:27.952 --> 11:31.687
Or... not fight.

11:31.689 --> 11:33.589
Honey...

11:33.591 --> 11:36.491
It's better if I run
because when I fight,

11:36.493 --> 11:39.761
well, it can get ugly.

11:42.398 --> 11:45.434
What time is your bus?

11:45.436 --> 11:46.535
At 4:00.

11:46.537 --> 11:49.404
Mm. So we only have
three more hours together.

11:49.406 --> 11:51.506
I miss you already.

11:51.508 --> 11:53.108
Same.

11:53.110 --> 11:54.843
But just think, in the fall
when I'm at C.C.S.U.,

11:54.845 --> 11:56.611
we'll only be 20 minutes
from each other.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.047
Can you stay in my dorm?

11:59.049 --> 12:00.515
I'm not sure.

12:00.517 --> 12:01.516
And I know I can't stay
in the barracks,

12:01.518 --> 12:03.084
although that would
be interesting.

12:03.086 --> 12:06.054
(Laughs) Mags, you're too much.

12:06.056 --> 12:07.756
Look, let's not
worry about that.

12:07.758 --> 12:09.658
We've got months
to figure that out.

12:09.660 --> 12:11.960
Yeah. Of course.

12:11.962 --> 12:13.795
You know what? I gotta go
hit the men's room.

12:13.797 --> 12:16.031
You wanna grab the checks?
We can head out, take a walk

12:16.033 --> 12:17.999
or... something.

12:18.001 --> 12:19.601
I like the sound of something.
(Chuckles)

12:19.603 --> 12:21.136
Hey, do you have any chapstick?

12:21.138 --> 12:23.638
Yeah, it's in my jacket.

12:36.986 --> 12:39.988
Hey!
How was your first day?

12:39.990 --> 12:41.356
(Door closes) Guess you're
doing such a good job

12:41.358 --> 12:42.524
they're letting you
leave early.

12:42.526 --> 12:45.526
I didn't get to do
my job at all.

12:45.528 --> 12:46.661
I got fired.

12:46.663 --> 12:47.795
What?

12:47.797 --> 12:49.097
Or more specifically,
Larissa was fired,

12:49.099 --> 12:51.633
and then I was just
swept out with the trash.

12:51.635 --> 12:54.135
And then I went to N.Y.U.
and found out

12:54.137 --> 12:56.204
that fall's not an option
either.

12:56.206 --> 12:57.872
Why didn't you call me? I did.

12:57.874 --> 12:59.407
You didn't answer.

12:59.409 --> 13:01.576
Oh, I must've been
walking Ollie.

13:01.578 --> 13:04.512
So what have you been
doing for the last few hours?

13:04.514 --> 13:06.447
Just wandering around in shock.

13:06.449 --> 13:09.050
I thought about drinking
myself into oblivion,

13:09.052 --> 13:11.786
but then I decided,
who wants to drink alone?

13:11.788 --> 13:12.920
So you wanna drink?

13:12.922 --> 13:15.790
- It's 3:00.
- So that's a no?

13:18.327 --> 13:20.428
Uh, maybe we should talk
before we drink.

13:20.430 --> 13:21.796
What is there to say?

13:21.798 --> 13:24.665
Well, I've been trying
to figure out a way

13:24.667 --> 13:26.100
to tell you something.

13:26.102 --> 13:29.270
- Something kinda big.
- Okay.

13:29.272 --> 13:34.942
And I haven't known how because,
well, your... your life is here.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.178
Well, not anymore.
There's nothing for me here.

13:37.180 --> 13:39.013
The city has officially
turned on me.

13:39.015 --> 13:40.381
Maybe that isn't a bad thing.

13:40.383 --> 13:42.783
Maybe it would leave you open
to other opportunities.

13:42.785 --> 13:44.218
Like what?

13:44.220 --> 13:46.120
Because I still think drinking
the day away is a good one.

13:46.122 --> 13:48.422
(Chuckles) So I've been
mulling around

13:48.424 --> 13:51.425
with the idea of moving
to Malibu for the company.

13:51.427 --> 13:54.128
I-I need to be there to see
if this investment

13:54.130 --> 13:55.229
could be something.

13:55.231 --> 13:58.265
Just for the summer.
Maybe for longer.

13:58.267 --> 13:59.833
So you'd leave Manhattan?

13:59.835 --> 14:02.603
I haven't wanted to because
I don't wanna leave you.

14:02.605 --> 14:04.571
But maybe now
I wouldn't have to.

14:04.573 --> 14:05.806
You could come with me.

14:05.808 --> 14:07.041
To California?

14:07.043 --> 14:08.042
For a few months.

14:08.044 --> 14:10.177
You could take walks
on the beach.

14:10.179 --> 14:11.845
I-I could teach you
to surf.

14:11.847 --> 14:14.348
It would be
an amazing adventure.

14:14.350 --> 14:16.250
Lots of material
for your writing.

14:16.252 --> 14:18.185
And we could be doing it
together.

14:18.187 --> 14:20.287
So what do you say?

14:28.555 --> 14:29.922
(Samantha) Whoo-hoo!

14:29.924 --> 14:31.390
(Singsongy)
We're going to Cali!

14:31.392 --> 14:33.726
Are you using the royal “We”?
Because I'm pretty sure

14:33.728 --> 14:37.163
I just said <i> I'm</i> going
to Malibu with Sebastian.

14:37.165 --> 14:38.698
Wouldn't you want
a friend there?

14:38.700 --> 14:41.467
I could keep some of Sebastian's
hot surfer boys company.

14:41.469 --> 14:43.335
(Singsongy) I wouldn't
want them to get lonely.

14:43.337 --> 14:44.970
Why would you leave the city?

14:44.972 --> 14:47.039
Because I'm a nomad.
And when the need comes,

14:47.041 --> 14:48.874
nomads move on
to greener pastures.

14:48.876 --> 14:50.342
Or bluer oceans.

14:50.344 --> 14:53.145
It's really that easy for you
to just pick up and move?

14:53.147 --> 14:55.047
Not just easy.
Essential.

14:55.049 --> 14:56.148
Well...
(Chopsticks snap)

14:56.150 --> 14:57.216
I hate moves.

14:57.218 --> 14:59.385
That's because you hold on
to too much.

14:59.387 --> 15:00.352
It's because I hold
so many things

15:00.354 --> 15:01.921
and so many people very dear.

15:01.923 --> 15:03.556
Well,
that's your first mistake.

15:03.558 --> 15:06.125
At the first sign of trouble,
you have to be ready to run.

15:06.127 --> 15:08.527
Hey, there's nothing wrong
with running away.

15:08.529 --> 15:11.897
It's in our D.N.A.
It's actually a safety valve.

15:11.899 --> 15:13.465
At least that's what
Elliot says.

15:13.467 --> 15:16.268
(Gasps) So you saw Elliot.

15:16.270 --> 15:19.405
Is that why you're suddenly
talking about moving?

15:19.407 --> 15:21.840
I might've... accidentally
slept with him.

15:21.842 --> 15:24.476
How does that
accidentally happen?

15:24.478 --> 15:28.213
He stalks you in actually
a cute and romantic way,

15:28.215 --> 15:29.848
and then you fall for it,
and then you think,

15:29.850 --> 15:31.950
“Yikes, I gotta get
out of here.”

15:31.952 --> 15:34.853
so less accident
and more train wreck.

15:34.855 --> 15:36.955
You don't have to move!
It's a big city.

15:36.957 --> 15:38.156
Look, this might be
hard for you to see

15:38.158 --> 15:40.759
because your life's
always been about stability.

15:40.761 --> 15:42.094
Not anymore.

15:42.096 --> 15:45.197
But for me, running has always
brought me to better places.

15:45.199 --> 15:47.799
The first time I ran away
from home to get away

15:47.801 --> 15:49.601
from my mom and one
of her deadbeat boyfriends,

15:49.603 --> 15:50.836
I wound up in Miami

15:50.838 --> 15:52.471
working at one
of the hottest clubs in town.

15:52.473 --> 15:56.942
Well, maybe there's nothing
for you to escape from now.

15:56.944 --> 15:58.310
How I feel about Elliot?

15:58.312 --> 16:01.279
Well, how exactly
<i>do</i> you feel about Elliot?

16:01.281 --> 16:04.149
Scared. Excited.

16:04.151 --> 16:06.218
Vulnerable.

16:06.220 --> 16:08.553
- Well, you can't run away from that.
- Sure, I can.

16:08.555 --> 16:10.822
I don't acknowledge it,
then it'll just go away.

16:10.824 --> 16:13.291
So if I never tell my dad
that I lost my job,

16:13.293 --> 16:15.760
and I'm moving to Malibu,
that will go away?

16:15.762 --> 16:18.096
See? Running and hiding
has its appeal.

16:18.098 --> 16:20.699
Mmm, yeah, it does.

16:22.668 --> 16:25.337
(Chuckles) Well,
look at the little lovebirds.

16:25.339 --> 16:27.739
Tommy, my friend, we are.

16:27.741 --> 16:29.274
I cannot wait
to marry this woman...

16:29.276 --> 16:31.409
So much so we're moving
the wedding up.

16:31.411 --> 16:33.011
Oh, it's two weeks from Friday.

16:33.013 --> 16:35.280
(Singsongy) So mark that day
in your calendar.

16:35.282 --> 16:37.115
Mm. It will be a day
that goes down in infamy.

16:37.117 --> 16:38.983
So I guess you decided
against a big wedding?

16:38.985 --> 16:40.919
(Scoffs) Are you high
on crack cocaine?

16:40.921 --> 16:43.555
A small wedding?
Why would we even bother?

16:43.557 --> 16:46.391
Well, I just assumed
since it was so soon that...

16:46.393 --> 16:47.892
It's going to be ginormous.
It's going to be over the top

16:47.894 --> 16:49.627
and totally inappropriate.

16:49.629 --> 16:50.795
That's my baby.

16:50.797 --> 16:52.597
Mmm. (Kisses)

16:52.599 --> 16:54.799
And since I'm not
at “Interview” anymore,

16:54.801 --> 16:57.168
I can use all of my talents
and focus and energy

16:57.170 --> 16:59.137
to make sure no one in this town
talks of anything else

16:59.139 --> 17:00.371
for the rest of the year.

17:00.373 --> 17:03.007
Wait, you're... not
at “Interview” anymore?

17:03.009 --> 17:05.410
Oh, Tom, I feel absolutely
horrible for Carrie.

17:05.412 --> 17:07.744
And I promise you, I will try
to help her find a job.

17:07.747 --> 17:10.281
I mean, after I finish planning
our wedding, our honeymoon.

17:10.282 --> 17:12.383
I hope the fact that Andy
blackballed me from publishing

17:12.385 --> 17:13.550
doesn't hurt her.

17:13.553 --> 17:14.819
Carrie lost her job?

17:14.820 --> 17:17.954
She didn't tell you?

17:19.458 --> 17:21.325
<i>♪</i>

17:21.327 --> 17:22.460
(Maggie) So what do you think?

17:22.462 --> 17:24.494
What <i> kind</i> of napkin?

17:24.497 --> 17:26.030
What difference does that make?

17:26.031 --> 17:28.666
Well, if it's from Hooters,
he's definitely cheating.

17:28.668 --> 17:30.968
If it's a cocktail napkin,
he's thinking about cheating,

17:30.970 --> 17:32.870
and if it's
a paper dinner napkin,

17:32.872 --> 17:35.239
well, he took her
someplace cheap.

17:35.241 --> 17:36.941
But he's still cheating.
(Groans)

17:36.943 --> 17:39.110
- The name on the napkin was Jess, right?
- Right.

17:39.112 --> 17:40.544
Maybe it's a guy.

17:40.546 --> 17:41.779
(Laughs) Even weirder.

17:41.781 --> 17:44.048
Oh, my God.
Am I dating another gay guy

17:44.050 --> 17:46.484
and I don't even know it?
Is that my thing?

17:46.486 --> 17:48.119
I don't get a gay vibe
from him at all.

17:48.121 --> 17:50.488
Pete is a great guy,
Maggie, and he loves you.

17:50.490 --> 17:51.722
And it's not like something
in the last week

17:51.724 --> 17:52.957
would've changed that.

17:52.959 --> 17:54.492
Have you been acting
at all desperate and needy?

17:54.494 --> 17:57.294
I.E., like yourself?
Guys run from that.

17:57.296 --> 17:58.696
He did start acting
kind of strange

17:58.698 --> 17:59.964
when I started talking

17:59.966 --> 18:01.198
about what our lives would be
like in the fall.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.901
Uhh. Case closed.
You scared him off.

18:03.903 --> 18:07.237
You didn't ask him specifics
like what days you'd be together

18:07.239 --> 18:09.239
or how'd you be together?

18:09.241 --> 18:11.075
I may have brought it up
a couple times this week.

18:11.077 --> 18:12.543
Oy.

18:12.545 --> 18:14.078
I'm sorry, but those are
important questions.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.879
Not three months out!

18:15.881 --> 18:17.548
Yeah. I agree with Donna.
Kinda scary.

18:17.550 --> 18:20.918
So I ran another guy off
with my desperation? Great.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.853
I'm gonna be alone forever.

18:22.855 --> 18:24.688
I think you should just
talk to Pete.

18:24.690 --> 18:26.123
Maybe it's not what we think.

18:26.125 --> 18:27.724
Maybe there's
a good explanation.

18:27.726 --> 18:29.459
But just to be safe,
I'd wear waterproof mascara.

18:29.461 --> 18:32.629
I'm guessing there could be
a few tears.

18:32.631 --> 18:34.965
(Knock on door)

18:34.967 --> 18:37.134
<i>They say you can run...</i>

18:40.605 --> 18:43.674
<i>But you can't hide.</i>

18:43.676 --> 18:45.609
Dad?

18:51.071 --> 18:55.207
So I decided to go to Malibu.

18:55.209 --> 18:58.377
Um, probably just
for a few months.

18:58.379 --> 19:01.380
Maybe a little longer.

19:06.119 --> 19:09.521
I'm done here, Carrie.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.290
I don't know what to say.

19:11.292 --> 19:13.992
Well, you could say
you support my decision.

19:13.994 --> 19:15.594
But that would be a lie.

19:15.596 --> 19:18.430
Well, can we at least
talk about this?

19:18.432 --> 19:19.832
No.

19:19.834 --> 19:22.801
You know how I feel about
the decision that got you here

19:22.803 --> 19:25.204
and the choice that
you're making now.

19:25.206 --> 19:30.175
But you are 18 years old,
and I can't stop you.

19:30.177 --> 19:32.444
So when are you leaving
for California?

19:32.446 --> 19:36.515
Um, after Larissa's wedding.

19:39.085 --> 19:41.353
I guess we can say
our good-byes then.

19:49.929 --> 19:51.797
(Door closes) <i> It's hard
to know in this world</i>

19:51.799 --> 19:55.000
<i>if you're running towards</i>
<i>or away from something.</i>

19:55.002 --> 19:59.371
<i>The markers, the milestones</i>
<i>look the same either way.</i>

19:59.373 --> 20:01.406
<i>So how do we know</i>
<i>if we're moving forward</i>

20:01.408 --> 20:03.642
<i>or just moving?</i>

20:03.644 --> 20:07.479
<i>And for some reason,</i>
<i>I was moved to come here...</i>

20:07.481 --> 20:10.615
<i>to Weaver's.</i>

20:10.617 --> 20:11.850
Carrie.

20:11.852 --> 20:13.451
<i>While I was reaching out</i>
<i>to someone meaningful</i>

20:13.453 --> 20:14.919
<i>from my past,</i>

20:14.921 --> 20:16.788
<i>Maggie was hoping</i>
<i>she wasn't about to</i>

20:16.790 --> 20:19.591
<i>reach out to someone</i>
<i>meaningful to Pete's present.</i>

20:19.593 --> 20:21.059
I thought you were going
to talk to Pete.

20:21.061 --> 20:22.560
I am. (Sighs)

20:22.562 --> 20:24.763
Right after I hear
this bitch-slut's voice.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.064
What if it's a guy?

20:26.066 --> 20:27.232
Well, then I can stop
freaking out

20:27.234 --> 20:28.733
and spending
my every waking moment

20:28.735 --> 20:31.035
figuring out how I'm gonna
tear this bitch-slut cooze

20:31.037 --> 20:32.136
limb from limb.

20:32.138 --> 20:33.538
Maggie...

20:33.540 --> 20:34.606
You agreed.
Talking to Pete...

20:34.608 --> 20:36.074
(Line ringing)
Shh, it's ringing.

20:36.076 --> 20:37.108
(Woman) Hello?

20:37.110 --> 20:38.209
(Whispers) Say something.
(Whispers) No!

20:38.211 --> 20:40.178
Say something. Say... no!

20:40.180 --> 20:43.581
(Exhales)
Hi. Is Jess there?

20:43.583 --> 20:44.682
This is she.

20:44.684 --> 20:47.752
It's a friend of Pete's.
Do you know him?

20:47.754 --> 20:48.987
Pete O'Malley? (Chuckles)

20:48.989 --> 20:51.055
Don't be silly.
Of course I know him.

20:51.057 --> 20:52.757
(Whispers) Ask how well.

20:52.759 --> 20:53.891
How well?

20:53.893 --> 20:55.059
I'm sorry?

20:55.061 --> 20:57.061
How well do you know Pete?

20:57.063 --> 21:01.132
I... well...
(Line disconnects, dial tone)

21:01.134 --> 21:04.569
Did she just hang up?

21:04.571 --> 21:06.237
(Hangs up receiver)

21:07.339 --> 21:09.907
So it sounds like you've
made a really good decision.

21:09.909 --> 21:12.109
I hear great things
about Malibu.

21:12.111 --> 21:13.311
I think so.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.580
I'm trying to envision myself
as Joan Didion,

21:15.582 --> 21:17.181
stepping away from the city

21:17.183 --> 21:18.950
so I can find
the space to write.

21:18.952 --> 21:20.451
Yeah, I'm not like that.

21:20.453 --> 21:23.154
I need the crush of people
to inspire me.

21:23.156 --> 21:25.189
What? Are you worried
about going?

21:25.191 --> 21:28.826
Well, Samantha says
I'm not good at change.

21:28.828 --> 21:30.494
But I guess who is?

21:30.496 --> 21:32.296
(Chuckles) Samantha?

21:32.298 --> 21:35.065
Yeah, she can definitely
roll with the punches.

21:35.067 --> 21:36.967
I'm not sure I can.

21:36.969 --> 21:38.969
I think that's why
I'm so hesitant.

21:38.971 --> 21:40.905
Is that why you came to see me?

21:40.907 --> 21:43.541
You looking for someone
to tell you not to go?

21:43.543 --> 21:45.709
No. I have my dad
for that.

21:45.711 --> 21:49.079
I guess I just wanted
someone's honest opinion.

21:49.081 --> 21:51.615
And I can't talk to
Sebastian about it.

21:51.617 --> 21:53.117
I don't want him to think

21:53.119 --> 21:55.319
I'm having doubts
because of him.

21:55.321 --> 21:56.654
Because I'm... I'm not.

21:56.656 --> 21:57.988
But you are having doubts.

21:57.990 --> 21:59.990
Well, yeah, it's a big move.

21:59.992 --> 22:04.328
I mean, what's gonna happen
to me? To my writing?

22:04.330 --> 22:06.663
You're talented
wherever you are.

22:06.665 --> 22:09.199
A zip code isn't gonna
change that.

22:09.201 --> 22:11.535
You were a huge part of me

22:11.537 --> 22:14.304
becoming who I am as a writer.

22:14.306 --> 22:15.806
You challenged me.

22:15.808 --> 22:19.910
But you also took me seriously
and helped me own my writing.

22:19.912 --> 22:22.012
I think you give me
way too much credit.

22:22.014 --> 22:23.680
(Laughs)
(Laughs)

22:23.682 --> 22:26.883
But if it means you
think of me every now and again,

22:26.885 --> 22:28.518
I'll take it.

22:28.520 --> 22:31.488
Yeah.

22:31.490 --> 22:33.090
Well, you were my first.

22:33.092 --> 22:36.026
So you'll always hold
a special place

22:36.028 --> 22:38.395
in this kooky brain of mine.

22:38.397 --> 22:40.897
Good.

22:40.899 --> 22:45.035
And if you decide to,
you know, come...

22:45.037 --> 22:48.171
or decide not to go at all...

22:48.173 --> 22:49.673
I'm here.

22:49.675 --> 22:52.317
Just a phone call away.

22:55.413 --> 22:58.415
So... how was work today?

22:58.417 --> 23:01.418
Fine.

23:01.420 --> 23:04.688
Anything interesting happen?

23:04.690 --> 23:07.424
Yeah. My youngest daughter
was being nice to me.

23:07.426 --> 23:09.359
Really?
What was that like?

23:09.361 --> 23:10.560
It was kind of scary.

23:10.562 --> 23:13.496
(Sighs) Not so fun
for me either.

23:13.498 --> 23:17.233
Look, I promised Carrie
I would be nice to you.

23:17.235 --> 23:18.701
Well, I wouldn't worry
about it.

23:18.703 --> 23:20.804
It's not like Carrie's so good
at keeping her word.

23:20.806 --> 23:23.006
Dad...

23:23.008 --> 23:25.108
Carrie didn't promise you
anything.

23:25.110 --> 23:27.377
She never promised you college

23:27.379 --> 23:28.878
or staying close by.

23:28.880 --> 23:32.515
I felt like we had a deal.

23:32.517 --> 23:34.350
She knew what was expected
of her.

23:34.352 --> 23:36.119
It wasn't a promise,

23:36.121 --> 23:38.221
but...

23:38.223 --> 23:40.623
I trusted her to do
the right thing,

23:40.625 --> 23:42.125
and she broke that trust.

23:42.127 --> 23:44.560
Because she isn't making
the choices you would make?

23:46.864 --> 23:50.266
It's always been hard for me
that you and Carrie

23:50.268 --> 23:51.768
have so much in common.

23:51.770 --> 23:54.137
But now I realize
it's been easier on me

23:54.139 --> 23:56.606
because you don't expect
so much from me.

23:56.608 --> 23:59.575
Dorrit, that is not true.
I want so much for you.

23:59.577 --> 24:01.344
Yeah, but you don't expect me

24:01.346 --> 24:03.446
to want the same things
you want.

24:04.648 --> 24:06.816
So why do you expect that
from Carrie?

24:10.487 --> 24:13.389
<i>While Dorrit was giving my dad</i>
<i>something to think about,</i>

24:13.391 --> 24:17.660
<i>Mouse and West were being given</i>
<i>the gift of encyclopedias.</i>

24:17.662 --> 24:20.596
Whoa! These are
the really fancy kind.

24:20.598 --> 24:23.466
Wait. I think this box only
has half the alphabet.

24:24.468 --> 24:27.770
Mine, too. Where are
the other boxes?

24:27.772 --> 24:30.106
They must not have accounted
for two valedictorians.

24:30.108 --> 24:33.609
So... what do we do now?

24:33.611 --> 24:35.478
You two are Castlebury's
best and brightest.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.479
I'm sure you'll come up
with a compromise.

24:37.481 --> 24:39.715
Uh, but, Mister... ugh.

24:39.717 --> 24:43.319
What are we supposed
to do with one gift?

24:48.491 --> 24:50.559
(Latches click)

24:50.561 --> 24:53.662
(Sighs) This place looks so...

24:53.664 --> 24:55.130
Empty.

24:55.132 --> 24:58.967
I was gonna say “sad,”

24:58.969 --> 25:01.904
it's weird to think someone else
will be living here.

25:01.906 --> 25:03.972
Has Larissa found anyone
to move in?

25:03.974 --> 25:07.576
Not yet. I think
she's trying to decide

25:07.578 --> 25:10.512
whether it's actually time to let it go.
(Suitcase thuds)

25:10.514 --> 25:12.414
I don't know how
she ever could. (Chuckles)

25:12.416 --> 25:15.651
Wait until you see the view
from the cliffs at Point Dume.

25:15.653 --> 25:17.920
It'll make leaving here
a lot easier.

25:17.922 --> 25:19.321
I talked to Shane today.

25:19.323 --> 25:21.523
He said Ollie is
loving the beach.

25:21.525 --> 25:22.724
Oh.

25:22.726 --> 25:24.092
And most of our stuff arrived.

25:24.094 --> 25:25.560
“Our stuff”"

25:25.562 --> 25:28.173
Mmm.
I like the sound of it.

25:28.293 --> 25:29.404
Me, too.

25:29.524 --> 25:30.415
Mm.

25:30.535 --> 25:32.097
You ready?

25:33.469 --> 25:35.003
Yeah.

25:36.706 --> 25:39.407
<i>In that moment, I wondered</i>
<i>why we say good-bye</i>

25:39.409 --> 25:41.743
<i>when we leave something</i>
<i>we love.</i>

25:43.312 --> 25:44.579
<i>Because most often,</i>

25:44.581 --> 25:46.982
<i>the parting feels painful</i>
<i>and sad.</i>

25:46.984 --> 25:49.211
<i>There's nothing good about it.</i>

25:49.331 --> 25:50.864
We should go.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.554
We don't wanna be late
for the wedding.

25:54.557 --> 25:56.224
Good-bye.

26:07.889 --> 26:10.424
(Indistinct conversations)

26:10.426 --> 26:13.460
(Playing jazz)

26:13.462 --> 26:16.730
♪

26:22.204 --> 26:24.472
Okay, this is incredible,
even for Larissa.

26:24.474 --> 26:25.773
They shut down the terminal?

26:25.775 --> 26:27.575
How'd she plan this
in two weeks?

26:27.577 --> 26:28.876
This is what unlimited energy

26:28.878 --> 26:30.945
and an unlimited budget
look like.

26:30.947 --> 26:32.180
Well, looks pretty good.

26:32.182 --> 26:35.049
Oh! Look! There's Bennet
and Walt. (Giggles)

26:35.051 --> 26:36.384
What exactly is Bennet wearing?

26:36.386 --> 26:38.553
- Don't ask.
- Why you're wearing that?

26:38.555 --> 26:40.154
No. Why Walt isn't.
(Chuckles)

26:40.156 --> 26:41.556
Okay, we won't.

26:41.558 --> 26:43.457
I'm giving Larissa away
and marrying them.

26:43.459 --> 26:45.526
- Oh, that's so sweet.
(Walt) - Isn't it?

26:45.528 --> 26:46.894
Her father couldn't be here.

26:46.896 --> 26:48.596
Apparently, being the king
of a tribe is a lot of work,

26:48.598 --> 26:50.197
so she asked me
to stand in his place.

26:50.199 --> 26:52.099
Well, if this is a preview of
what Larissa is going to wear,

26:52.101 --> 26:55.002
I cannot wait. You don't have to.
Larissa needs you.

26:55.004 --> 26:56.570
Well, I need you.

26:56.572 --> 26:58.973
You've gotta convince her
to stop taking muscle relaxers.

26:58.975 --> 27:00.207
So the bride's in usual form?

27:00.209 --> 27:01.342
Pretty much.

27:01.344 --> 27:02.443
You don't mind if I go?

27:02.445 --> 27:04.478
Not at all.
Go save the bride from herself.

27:07.516 --> 27:09.617
Here comes Mr. Bradshaw.

27:09.619 --> 27:12.119
- Walt, good to see you.
- Same.

27:12.121 --> 27:14.622
- Sebastian.
- Hi, sir.

27:14.624 --> 27:16.357
We miss having you
around the house.

27:16.359 --> 27:17.825
So quiet without...

27:17.827 --> 27:20.094
You and Carrie.

27:20.096 --> 27:21.528
Um...

27:21.530 --> 27:24.164
But I guess that's what happens
when people grow up.

27:24.166 --> 27:25.332
Look, Mr. Bradshaw,

27:25.334 --> 27:27.167
I never wanted to come
between you and Carrie.

27:27.169 --> 27:29.036
That was never my intention.

27:29.038 --> 27:31.839
You know what? I should check
if Bennet needs help.

27:31.841 --> 27:34.041
I know, Sebastian.

27:34.043 --> 27:35.909
This isn't about you.
It's about Carrie.

27:35.911 --> 27:38.045
But it's about her happiness,
and we both want that, right?

27:38.047 --> 27:39.613
I know that you're going
out to California

27:39.615 --> 27:44.117
to chase your dream,
but Carrie...

27:44.119 --> 27:47.120
she's not running
towards something.

27:47.122 --> 27:48.622
She's running away...

27:48.624 --> 27:52.292
from her mistakes,
from potential failure,

27:52.294 --> 27:56.229
and... I didn't raise her
to run away.

28:00.268 --> 28:03.337
Okay, this stalking thing
is getting old, fast.

28:03.339 --> 28:05.238
And maybe it seemed romantic
even a week ago,

28:05.240 --> 28:06.540
but now it's the creepy kind...

28:06.542 --> 28:08.775
The stalking kind of stalking.

28:08.777 --> 28:10.744
I know.
I must seem insane.

28:10.746 --> 28:12.813
Yes, you do, and normally
I like insane,

28:12.815 --> 28:14.314
but this is too much.

28:14.316 --> 28:16.249
I told you I didn't wanna
see you again,

28:16.251 --> 28:18.752
and I'm not gonna run away
just because you were here.

28:18.754 --> 28:21.354
You are gonna have to leave
even if I have to fight you.

28:21.356 --> 28:22.455
You're too beautiful to fight.

28:22.457 --> 28:23.623
I am beautiful,

28:23.625 --> 28:25.659
but I'm also strong as hell,
and I will take you.

28:25.661 --> 28:28.862
This place is my safe space.
You need to leave.

28:28.864 --> 28:31.197
You need to go back to your wife
and never come back.

28:31.199 --> 28:33.066
I left my wife.

28:34.135 --> 28:36.102
For you.

28:36.104 --> 28:37.737
For me?

28:37.739 --> 28:41.174
I told Sally
I was in love with you...

28:41.176 --> 28:42.976
which I am.

28:42.978 --> 28:45.512
So what does that mean,
exactly?

28:45.514 --> 28:47.981
I mean, are you looking to have
another open relationship?

28:47.983 --> 28:50.383
Because... I can't believe
I'm saying this...

28:50.385 --> 28:51.451
I don't want that.

28:51.453 --> 28:53.052
I-I don't want that either.

28:53.054 --> 28:56.055
Look, I don't think I was happy
in my relationship

28:56.057 --> 28:57.090
for a long time.

28:57.092 --> 28:59.259
That's why I pushed
for an open marriage.

28:59.261 --> 29:03.596
I was searching
for something...

29:03.598 --> 29:06.766
- something I found with you.
- Oh.

29:10.604 --> 29:13.840
My beautiful shiksa princess,

29:13.842 --> 29:17.009
when I think about love,

29:17.011 --> 29:18.711
I think about planes,

29:18.713 --> 29:22.815
because that is where
we first did the dirty deed.

29:22.817 --> 29:24.317
Oh, no.

29:24.319 --> 29:25.618
I really don't wanna hear this.

29:25.620 --> 29:28.855
You had never joined
the mile high club before.

29:28.857 --> 29:31.257
And I was proud

29:31.259 --> 29:34.961
to open your eyes to sex
in a very small bathroom,

29:34.963 --> 29:38.097
and now every time
I walk through an airport,

29:38.099 --> 29:41.567
I think of you and how one trip

29:41.569 --> 29:44.503
where I practically tore
my hammy...

29:44.505 --> 29:45.838
(Laughs)

29:45.840 --> 29:47.006
Is how we found love.

29:47.008 --> 29:48.507
Oh, I love you, baby.

29:48.509 --> 29:50.276
Don't kiss yet.

29:50.278 --> 29:51.444
Larissa, your vows.

29:51.446 --> 29:52.812
- Oh.
- Oh. (Chuckles)

29:52.814 --> 29:55.381
- Harlan...
- Mm-hmm.

29:55.383 --> 29:57.116
I love this airport.
(Chuckles)

29:57.118 --> 29:58.584
And not just because we did it

29:58.586 --> 30:00.152
in the first class lounge
as well,

30:00.154 --> 30:03.856
but because people come here
running to and fro

30:03.858 --> 30:06.125
to catch flights that will
take them on adventures

30:06.127 --> 30:09.195
to places they've never been,

30:09.197 --> 30:10.596
to see the world...

30:10.598 --> 30:13.265
all things
that I wanna share with you.

30:13.267 --> 30:16.201
But airports aren't
only about leaving.

30:16.203 --> 30:18.337
They're also about
people coming home

30:18.339 --> 30:21.940
to their families,
to their loved ones,

30:21.942 --> 30:26.645
and that's what you are
to me... my family, my home.

30:26.647 --> 30:29.648
We all need a-a place
to come home to,

30:29.650 --> 30:33.752
and in you and this
amazing city, I have found it...

30:33.754 --> 30:35.587

30:37.524 --> 30:40.526
No. I don't want the “x.”

Castlebury has to offer.

competitive person

Breakfast at the diner.

37:55.078 --> 37:56.978
It's what we used to do.

37:56.980 --> 37:59.514
Maybe those encyclopedias
aren't so bad after all.

37:59.516 --> 38:01.515
But I really don't want them.

38:01.517 --> 38:05.486
Me, either.
They're so big and heavy.

38:05.488 --> 38:08.322
And it's not like
Harvard doesn't have them.

38:08.324 --> 38:09.757
Should we donate them
to the high school?

38:09.759 --> 38:11.559
I like that idea.

38:14.229 --> 38:15.496
I'm really glad

38:15.498 --> 38:18.299
this is the way
we are saying good-bye.

Me, too.

Why don't you just do
your laundry at the base?

38:25.174 --> 38:26.373
They use too much starch.

38:26.375 --> 38:28.909
And I like the way
your soap smells.

38:28.911 --> 38:30.244
It reminds me of you.

38:30.246 --> 38:32.980
It's like you're with me

you know.

38:35.051 --> 38:36.383

38:36.385 --> 38:37.985
I mean, you don't have to act
all romantic all the time.

38:37.987 --> 38:39.019
I don't expect anything.

38:39.021 --> 38:40.688
I mean, I do.
I expect a lot,

38:40.690 --> 38:43.590
and I deserve it, too, but it
doesn't have to be with you.

38:43.592 --> 38:46.527
I don't think

38:54.270 --> 38:55.803
when I asked about
your plans for the fall...

38:55.805 --> 38:57.504
Because you were gonna
break up with me by then?

38:57.506 --> 38:59.573
You don't understand.
Jess isn't a girl.

38:59.575 --> 39:00.607

they give out napkins

who I bunk with,

39:16.392 --> 39:18.191
wrote her number down
so that I could call her

39:18.193 --> 39:21.028
to get something...
for you.
