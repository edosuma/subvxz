11:12.714 --> 11:14.339
and mind of the artist.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.342
You had me at "take a seat."

11:17.535 --> 11:21.087
I don't know art,
but I know what I like.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.090
And I like eating
and not looking at art.

11:24.184 --> 11:28.094
I hereby award you
the Royal Medallion.

11:28.246 --> 11:31.172
(chuckles) Congratulations
on your discerning eye,

11:31.191 --> 11:32.006
Your Majesty.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.766
I love this pupil.

11:33.860 --> 11:37.678
Is this not the student that you
expelled from the royal salon?

11:37.739 --> 11:40.757
Well, I--
Uh, that is, I, uh...

11:40.817 --> 11:42.926
Just pretend I'm not here.

11:42.986 --> 11:46.037
Uh, sir, is your tongue
sticking out because you're dead

11:46.230 --> 11:47.931
or because you're mad at me?

11:47.991 --> 11:49.432
Uh, little of both.

11:49.492 --> 11:51.710
Yeah.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.446
Oh, sure, Maggie.
That's easy.

12:03.506 --> 12:07.041
Renaissance artists love to put
babies in their paintings,

12:07.060 --> 12:08.727
especially baby angels.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.563
Let's just not think about<i> why</i>
there were so many babies

12:11.756 --> 12:13.523

12:53.130 --> 12:55.422

12:55.442 --> 12:57.758
So, telling stories
about art, huh?

12:57.819 --> 13:00.853
Do they have one about a fat guy
whose wife is too good for him?

13:00.947 --> 13:02.113
Stupid fat guy.

13:02.306 --> 13:04.431
Bet he doesn't even know
what's going on.

13:04.493 --> 13:08.435
Well, Dad, have you ever heard
of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo?

13:08.497 --> 13:10.121
(scoffs)
Lisa, I haven't even heard

13:10.314 --> 13:12.773
of Jackson Pollock
and Lee Krasner.

13:12.834 --> 13:17.186
Well, Diego and Frida
were married in 1929.

whilst I am

14:37.902 --> 14:39.619
Yes, we hate the capitalists.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.788
Right now,
a young socialist is being born

14:42.924 --> 14:43.956

Señor Rockefeller,

15:01.392 --> 15:03.884
what is it
you are looking for from Diego?

15:03.945 --> 15:05.719
Frida, please!
I'm so sorry.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.481
My wife does not understand
these discussions.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.393
I understand
that he is paying you $21,000

15:12.454 --> 15:15.396
for a mural
for his new Rockefeller Center

15:15.457 --> 15:18.141
with the theme
"man at the crossroads."

15:18.159 --> 15:19.918
$21,000.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.869
Do you know what that is
in today's money?

15:21.922 --> 15:24.738
$21,000.

15:24.758 --> 15:25.957
(whoops)

15:26.092 --> 15:28.651
This entire area
will be your canvas.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.929
(gasps)
I will need very tiny brushes,

15:31.122 --> 15:32.430
a magnifying glass

15:32.623 --> 15:34.915
and a huge bottle of tequila.

15:34.976 --> 15:35.841
No worm.

15:35.994 --> 15:37.343

15:37.437 --> 15:39.011

You drive a hard bargain,

15:39.164 --> 15:40.680
but this is just a model.

15:40.832 --> 15:43.775
The real Rockefeller Center
will be 66 stories high.

15:43.926 --> 15:47.853
And every Christmas, we will
kill and decorate a giant tree

15:47.948 --> 15:51.157
as a warning to the other trees.

15:52.068 --> 15:53.434

15:53.495 --> 15:55.954
Oh, Frida.
Let us celebrate our triumph

15:56.147 --> 15:58.014
with some snuggle-issimo.

15:58.074 --> 16:00.107
-No.
-(gasps) What's wrong, my dear?

16:00.168 --> 16:01.867
Is your unibrow hurting?

16:01.962 --> 16:04.629
You are selling out, my love.

16:06.949 --> 16:08.357
I am not selling out!

16:08.418 --> 16:10.784
I am doing this mural
for the little guy!

16:10.845 --> 16:12.545
People like him!

16:12.639 --> 16:15.381
Why are you washing windows
at night?

16:15.533 --> 16:18.017
Who said I was washing windows?

16:19.354 --> 16:21.813
As for you,
squander your gift,

16:22.006 --> 16:23.556
spit on your talent.

16:23.708 --> 16:26.800
-I am glad we are in agreement.
-(huffs)

16:26.861 --> 16:29.320
But what will<i> I</i>  do
while you work on your mural?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.989
Paint a happy self-portrait,

16:31.182 --> 16:32.657
smiling ear to ear,

16:32.850 --> 16:34.158
not a care in the world.

16:34.351 --> 16:36.661
That's not who I am, Diego!

16:36.854 --> 16:38.145

16:38.206 --> 16:40.314

16:41.209 --> 16:43.559

Paint your misery.

16:43.619 --> 16:46.320
Also, leave.
Leave your husband.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.339
Which one of you is the angel?

16:48.491 --> 16:49.415
-We both are.
-We both are.

16:49.567 --> 16:51.417
That's how mad you're feeling.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.735

16:57.800 --> 16:59.742

16:59.802 --> 17:01.668

17:01.688 --> 17:04.838
Now we got to get our stories
straight about Zeppo.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.007
It was an accident, okay?

17:07.068 --> 17:08.434
(honks)

17:08.528 --> 17:10.028
Ah...

17:10.221 --> 17:11.921
Starting a new painting?

17:12.023 --> 17:15.349
Yes.
I am painting my feelings.

17:15.452 --> 17:17.351
Oh! Oh!

17:17.370 --> 17:18.185
Wow.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.038
So strong, so brave,

17:20.231 --> 17:21.855
so true to herself.

17:21.916 --> 17:22.856
Mm...

17:22.876 --> 17:24.208
(groans)

17:24.401 --> 17:26.711
My darling, I am not
half the artist you are.

17:26.904 --> 17:29.363
Diego, what are you saying?

17:29.382 --> 17:32.608
I am saying I've underestimated
you all this time.

17:32.627 --> 17:33.885
You are a genius!

17:34.036 --> 17:36.721
From now on,
I will show my awe of you

17:36.914 --> 17:38.222
by sleeping with other women.

17:38.374 --> 17:40.116
Starting an hour ago.

17:40.176 --> 17:43.119
And I will sleep with other
women starting two hours ago.

17:43.221 --> 17:45.897
I'm so glad
I don't hear what you say.

17:46.048 --> 17:49.809
But I will do something I have
not done in our entire marriage:

17:49.961 --> 17:51.385
what<i> you</i> want.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.887
Well, actions speak louder
than words.

17:53.907 --> 17:57.075
No. Unless the action is the
demolition of a big building,

17:57.268 --> 17:58.818
words are usually louder.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.636
Everything is a fight.

18:00.696 --> 18:02.471
I completely disagree.

18:02.490 --> 18:04.398
But just wait
till you see what I do.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.567
You'll be pleased
with what I do not do,

18:06.586 --> 18:08.644
and you will love what I do do.

18:08.704 --> 18:09.662
Good night!

18:09.798 --> 18:11.738
(grumbles)

18:11.800 --> 18:13.999
Welcome to Rockefeller Center,

18:14.094 --> 18:15.484
a temple of capitalism.

18:15.545 --> 18:17.153
To find a taller building,

18:17.255 --> 18:19.413
you'd have to walk
a full seven blocks.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.006
(chuckles):
Long blocks.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.749
With people bumping you.

18:22.769 --> 18:26.145
Enough already. While the art
is still deco, okay?

18:28.191 --> 18:29.590
For you, my darling.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.984
<i> Man at the Crossroads.</i>

18:33.113 --> 18:34.520
Rich people.
Yes, excellent.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.022
The cosmos.
Yes, makes sense.

18:37.175 --> 18:38.282
A worker.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.176
Well, I suppose
it couldn't be helped.

18:40.236 --> 18:41.435
Fascist army.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.788
Always welcome in any lobby.

18:43.981 --> 18:45.957
Hmm. Who's that fellow?

18:46.150 --> 18:49.185
With the beard
and the Bolshevik smile.

18:49.245 --> 18:52.705
That is the founder
of Soviet Russia, Lenin.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.465
But-but-but he's a communist.

18:54.658 --> 18:56.859
Oh, he just attended
a couple of meetings.

18:56.919 --> 19:00.029
I can't have a communist
in my colossus of capitalism.

19:00.089 --> 19:01.121
Paint over it.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.365
No!

19:02.425 --> 19:03.957
Then you will lose
your commission,

19:03.977 --> 19:06.561
and I won't let you be
the model for Atlas.

19:07.838 --> 19:09.054
Hmm...

19:09.207 --> 19:10.631
I don't care.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.542
