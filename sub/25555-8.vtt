I will never get back
with Logan.

40:18.182 --> 40:20.951
I don't want him
to be part of my life.

40:21.018 --> 40:22.753
All he does is drag me down.

40:22.820 --> 40:23.854
Did y'all see my face?

40:23.921 --> 40:25.055
In shock the whole time.

40:25.122 --> 40:27.858
{\an1}I don't know how he even
got in the house.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.994
When he walked in the room
and I'm like this.

40:30.060 --> 40:31.629
We need to lock our doors,

40:31.695 --> 40:34.031
because we got random people
popping up in this bitch.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.200
(bleep) that mother(bleep).
(bleep) him.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.603
Logan's legal state of mind
scares me...

40:39.670 --> 40:41.138
a lot.

40:41.205 --> 40:42.139
Is, um, he gone?

40:42.206 --> 40:43.741
I don't know.

40:43.808 --> 40:46.877
He's probably outside (bleep)
staring into the (bleep) room.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.213
I still...
I'm shutting the blinds.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.481
Okay, I'm gonna go.

40:50.548 --> 40:51.515
We're done.

40:51.582 --> 40:53.184
We are not together.

40:53.250 --> 40:54.552
Logan's stressing me out.

40:54.618 --> 40:55.820
I know.
Do not stress.

40:55.886 --> 40:57.688
Breathe.
If you, if you are,

40:57.755 --> 40:59.123
{\an5}stress is not good for you.

40:57.755 --> 40:59.123
{\an1}I know.

40:59.190 --> 41:00.891
If you stress out, it's
gonna cause a miscarriage.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.226
{\an1}(crying)
I know...

41:02.293 --> 41:03.928
{\an5}So don't stress out.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.928
Just breathe, just breathe.

41:03.994 --> 41:06.931
{\an5}My stomach
is (bleep) killing me.

41:03.994 --> 41:06.931
What's wrong?

41:06.997 --> 41:09.066
I don't know,
it just hurts really bad.

41:09.133 --> 41:10.367
