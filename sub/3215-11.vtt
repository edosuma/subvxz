00:00.550 --> 00:03.969
Pastor Bennett: What is
the nature of forgiveness?

00:05.101 --> 00:07.569
What's the disposition of mercy?

00:07.604 --> 00:10.806
It has no weight. It's not coarse, but fine.

00:10.840 --> 00:14.643
It's as precious as it is limitless.

00:14.677 --> 00:18.814
Daily, for transgressions large and small,

00:18.848 --> 00:22.818
we must ask and we must give pardon.

00:22.852 --> 00:24.820
Our hearts cannot be sealed,

00:24.854 --> 00:27.322
and our empathy cannot be limited.

00:43.873 --> 00:46.909
True forgiveness is a phenomenal act,

00:46.943 --> 00:50.846
but one we each have
the capacity to perform.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.650
For if we as a people cannot forgive,

00:54.684 --> 01:00.756
then we as a people are cursed to hate.

Woman: <i>You have reached

02:23.473 --> 02:24.873
Mark: <i>Mark Skokie.</i>

02:24.908 --> 02:25.841
Woman: <i>Please leave a message.</i>

02:27.043 --> 02:29.778
Mark, now, we need to get
together and deal with this...

02:29.812 --> 02:30.946
This nonsense.

02:30.980 --> 02:32.548
This is not about me.

02:32.582 --> 02:34.082
This is... this is not about your brother.

02:34.117 --> 02:37.352
Now, you said you were
going to be here for Gwen.

02:37.387 --> 02:39.755
So think about how she's
gonna feel knowing that...

02:39.789 --> 02:42.190
That the prosecutors are letting off this...

02:42.225 --> 02:43.692
Man: <i>If you're happy with your message</i>

02:43.726 --> 02:45.260
<i>and want to send it normal
delivery, press one.</i>

02:45.295 --> 02:46.762
<i>If you want to deliv...</i>

02:46.796 --> 02:48.130
Barb: <i>This is Barb.</i>

02:48.164 --> 02:49.898
<i>I can't come to the phone. Leave a message.</i>

02:51.568 --> 02:53.602
Barb, I really, really need to talk to you

02:53.636 --> 02:54.703
about what's going on.

02:54.737 --> 02:55.704
They called to tell me

02:55.738 --> 02:57.940
that they're actually letting that man off.

02:57.974 --> 03:01.777
But they're not explaining
anything to me, and...

03:01.811 --> 03:05.280
Well,

03:05.315 --> 03:07.416
They talk to you, Barb.

03:07.450 --> 03:10.886
And you damn sure know how to handle them.

03:10.920 --> 03:14.790
And so I'm asking you

03:14.824 --> 03:17.893
<i>to please not give up on this.</i>

03:17.927 --> 03:21.063
<i>This is important, Barb.</i>

03:21.097 --> 03:23.932
Please call me back.

03:31.307 --> 03:34.176
Aliyah: Bitch.

03:34.210 --> 03:36.578
Filthy bitch.

03:36.613 --> 03:39.815
Filthy black bitch.

03:39.849 --> 03:43.952
You damn filthy black bitch.

03:45.388 --> 03:47.856
What else did they say about me? Hm?

03:47.890 --> 03:49.658
- Basilah: Terrorist?
- Oh!

03:49.692 --> 03:51.827
I got that at the airport.

03:51.861 --> 03:52.995
Mm.

03:54.631 --> 03:57.866
I heard things I cannot
repeat in a place of worship.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.935
What they said,

03:59.969 --> 04:03.805
and the arrogance they had
when they would say it...

04:03.840 --> 04:05.340
The entitlement.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.677
They think that they are...

04:08.711 --> 04:11.279
You know what? It's all right.

04:12.749 --> 04:13.949
They can talk how they talk.

04:13.983 --> 04:15.317
Yeah. Mmhmm.

04:15.351 --> 04:17.819
They're not talking that
loudly anymore, are they?

04:18.921 --> 04:21.523
Lies come back on the liars.

04:21.557 --> 04:24.926
Deceptions come back on the deceivers.

04:26.596 --> 04:28.997
Good comes to the righteous.

04:31.501 --> 04:35.237
My brother is a good man.

04:35.271 --> 04:38.507
I heard him trashed.

04:38.541 --> 04:41.410
I heard him demonized.

04:41.444 --> 04:44.179
I heard people saying...

04:45.882 --> 04:47.683
Those people saying,

04:47.717 --> 04:51.219
"your brother's gonna get
exactly what he deserves."

04:53.856 --> 04:56.058
He got what he deserves.

04:56.092 --> 04:57.859
He walked free.

04:57.894 --> 05:00.529
That's right. Yes.

05:04.067 --> 05:06.234
You've given me my family back.

05:07.804 --> 05:12.140
And I've never been more
thankful than I am today.

05:27.657 --> 05:30.292
I-i don't know what to say.

05:30.326 --> 05:33.195
I-i don't even know what happened.

05:33.229 --> 05:35.363
One minute, they got me in a cell,

05:35.398 --> 05:37.933
talking about how they
going to execute me...

05:37.967 --> 05:40.435
The next, I'm standing here.

05:47.677 --> 05:50.011
I'm just, uh...

05:52.448 --> 05:55.083
Man: Take your time, my brother.

05:55.118 --> 05:56.551
Take your time.

05:57.587 --> 06:02.057
It's... it's... it's been hard...

06:02.091 --> 06:06.895
Carrying other people's Faith.

06:06.929 --> 06:09.064
Not used to it.

06:13.035 --> 06:16.671
Parts of my life, the past few years,

06:16.706 --> 06:20.776
uh, I don't even...

06:20.810 --> 06:23.278
I don't even remember all the bad...

06:26.449 --> 06:28.617
Sorry.

06:31.020 --> 06:32.420
Sorry.

06:35.224 --> 06:37.259
It's just, um...

06:42.532 --> 06:44.666
I feel...

06:49.739 --> 06:53.608
It's how Aliyah said...

06:53.643 --> 06:55.844
Deserving things.

07:25.374 --> 07:28.243
What happened?

07:28.277 --> 07:31.680
It's by the grace of
Allah you were able to...

07:31.714 --> 07:34.216
Man, what the hell happened?!

07:34.250 --> 07:36.751
Nobody tells me anything.

07:36.786 --> 07:40.522
Nobody <i>says</i> anything.

07:40.556 --> 07:43.992
They didn't just let me out.

07:44.026 --> 07:46.962
What are you <i>not</i> telling me?

07:48.798 --> 07:52.067
Your girlfriend confessed to the crime.

08:06.048 --> 08:08.016
Why would she do that?

08:10.753 --> 08:14.055
They let me go just
because she said she did it?

08:14.090 --> 08:16.124
She didn't just say she did it.

08:16.158 --> 08:19.694
She offered up evidence
only the killer would know.

08:19.729 --> 08:23.598
And she claimed to be the only
one there when it happened.

08:23.633 --> 08:26.401
Lies come back on the liars.

08:26.435 --> 08:28.937
Deceptions come back on...

09:18.112 --> 09:20.847
What up, boy? How was juvie?

09:20.881 --> 09:22.415
What'd you say?

09:22.450 --> 09:24.184
Yeah, i seen your little video.

09:24.218 --> 09:25.452
Think you a badass?

09:27.088 --> 09:29.256
Oh, you think you a little badass, huh?

09:29.290 --> 09:32.292
Come on, man. Let me see
what kind of badass you are.

09:32.326 --> 09:33.760
Hegera: Words were exchanged.

09:33.794 --> 09:35.262
The confrontation between the two students

09:35.296 --> 09:36.062
continued to escalate,

09:36.097 --> 09:37.631
at which point one of our teachers...

09:37.665 --> 09:38.398
What did my son do?

09:38.432 --> 09:39.933
It wasn't <i>what</i> he did...

09:39.967 --> 09:42.135
Did Tony hit this other
kid? Did he attack him?

09:42.169 --> 09:45.472
Tony didn't do anything.

09:45.506 --> 09:47.274
So you're calling me in from my job

09:47.308 --> 09:49.442
to tell me that my son didn't do anything?

09:49.477 --> 09:51.444
Considering your son's past history...

09:51.479 --> 09:52.946
I'm talking about right now.

09:52.980 --> 09:54.547
Or every time I hear from you,

09:54.582 --> 09:57.050
it's gonna be about this
"past history" bull...

09:59.787 --> 10:01.388
Tony, let's go.

10:10.364 --> 10:11.798
Aubrey: You came.

10:11.832 --> 10:13.133
Yeah.

10:13.167 --> 10:15.802
Your sister did it. She got you off.

10:15.836 --> 10:18.438
I hope you learn to appreciate her,

10:18.472 --> 10:19.773
everything she's done for you.

10:19.807 --> 10:21.241
Why'd you confess?

10:21.275 --> 10:24.411
Why do you think? I'm not
gonna let them kill you.

10:24.445 --> 10:26.513
So I got to live to watch you die?

10:26.547 --> 10:28.448
They're not gonna kill me. I'm mental.

10:28.482 --> 10:30.650
Haven't you heard of all the horrible things

10:30.685 --> 10:31.818
my family's done to me?

10:31.852 --> 10:35.322
They're not gonna let you out.

10:35.356 --> 10:38.591
You do have problems.

10:40.061 --> 10:41.961
I don't think they're
ever gonna let you out.

10:41.996 --> 10:45.365
Even if they give me 15
years, I wouldn't be that old.

10:45.399 --> 10:47.767
We'd have a lot of time to be together.

10:47.802 --> 10:51.171
Somewhere warm. On a beach.

10:51.205 --> 10:53.206
Like in the magazine ad.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.974
The one you tore up.

10:55.009 --> 10:58.845
You make it sound <i>so</i> real.

10:58.879 --> 11:01.948
It is.

11:01.982 --> 11:05.051
It's what I always loved about you.

11:05.086 --> 11:09.255
You could take dreams and
make them feel <i>so</i> real.

11:14.528 --> 11:18.064
When I was a kid, I was kind of a loser.

11:18.099 --> 11:21.901
I wasn't cool enough for
the other black kids.

11:21.936 --> 11:25.472
Too black to hang around the white kids.

11:25.506 --> 11:27.407
Never got dates.

11:27.441 --> 11:29.342
Never.

11:29.377 --> 11:31.378
So I made myself up a girlfriend.

11:31.412 --> 11:32.679
And Elaine became...

11:32.713 --> 11:33.913
Elaine?

11:35.416 --> 11:38.184
First she was just some bull...
in my head, you know?

11:38.219 --> 11:39.219
Mm-hmm.

11:39.253 --> 11:43.390
Somebody who answered
whenever I'd talk to myself.

11:43.424 --> 11:46.393
But she got more and more real.

11:46.427 --> 11:49.396
Really specific...

11:49.430 --> 11:54.033
How she looked, the kind
of stuff she was into.

11:54.068 --> 11:57.337
She read Chandler and loved Hendrix.

11:57.371 --> 12:00.940
And her favorite sport was sleeping.

12:00.975 --> 12:05.078
She was as perfect as a girl
was ever going to get...

12:09.417 --> 12:13.953
Right up until I saw you working
a beer at the end of a bar.

12:13.988 --> 12:15.955
You and me are beautiful.

12:15.990 --> 12:18.224
The drugs made us beautiful.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.059
- We beat them.
- The liquor made us feel good.

12:20.094 --> 12:22.796
All of them... The racists and the haters.

12:22.830 --> 12:25.131
<i>We</i> are beautiful.

12:25.166 --> 12:26.866
A-and we deserve to live like that.

12:26.901 --> 12:30.103
It's not real!

12:30.137 --> 12:31.871
You can't be the girl in my head,

12:31.906 --> 12:34.374
and I can't be the guy you're
walking on a beach with

12:34.408 --> 12:35.375
in a magazine ad.

12:35.409 --> 12:36.910
So you're just gonna run off

12:36.944 --> 12:38.578
and find yourself another girl?

12:40.448 --> 12:42.749
Never. Never.

12:44.585 --> 12:48.388
I think the only other girl I
could ever be with is Elaine.

12:51.525 --> 12:54.794
You know what?

12:54.829 --> 12:57.897
... that.

12:57.932 --> 12:59.899
Your little pretend girlfriend

12:59.934 --> 13:02.335
when I'm here trying to give myself to you.

13:02.369 --> 13:04.637
You think people got to pay for their sins?

13:04.672 --> 13:07.240
We're not done. You know that.

13:12.646 --> 13:14.647
Part of me being here,

13:14.682 --> 13:17.116
part of me getting healthy

13:17.151 --> 13:20.086
is they think I need to have
contact with the outside world.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.655
So... you can call here

13:22.690 --> 13:24.424
and they'll put you through to me.

13:29.630 --> 13:32.765
I'm not calling.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.101
Yes, you will.

13:37.371 --> 13:40.673
You're going to call.

13:40.708 --> 13:42.709
You're going to come back to me.

13:42.743 --> 13:44.277
Jensen: No touching.

13:44.311 --> 13:46.880
And we are going to be phenomenal.

13:46.914 --> 13:48.481
I said no touching!

14:06.614 --> 14:08.214
Alonzo: Come here, mijo.
I want to show you this.

14:08.249 --> 14:09.249
Where is it?

14:09.283 --> 14:11.584
Outside San Jose. It needs work.

14:11.619 --> 14:14.554
It needs a lot of work.

14:14.588 --> 14:15.422
And a lot of money.

14:15.456 --> 14:18.391
We'd have to put our savings into it...

14:18.426 --> 14:20.427
And sell the house.

14:20.461 --> 14:22.629
We'd live in an apartment for a while,

14:22.663 --> 14:24.597
just until business picked up.

14:24.632 --> 14:25.932
But it will pick up.

14:25.966 --> 14:29.302
San Jose, man, that city's growing.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.971
You plan on driving to San Jose every day?

14:32.006 --> 14:33.940
We'd get an apartment there.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.141
You want to move?

14:35.176 --> 14:37.310
I want us to get a fresh start.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.611
You want to move.

14:38.646 --> 14:40.280
The job I have now,

14:40.314 --> 14:43.650
working for other people, it's killing me.

14:43.684 --> 14:45.585
And I can't keep taking you out of school

14:45.619 --> 14:47.087
for something that's not your fault.

14:47.121 --> 14:48.555
But everything just got fixed.

14:48.589 --> 14:49.656
It didn't get fixed.

14:49.690 --> 14:51.758
It's not gonna get fixed.

14:51.792 --> 14:54.561
The people here are always gonna be thinking

14:54.595 --> 14:55.762
about us different now.

14:55.796 --> 14:57.230
Always.

14:58.833 --> 15:01.734
I can't have you guys living like...

15:01.769 --> 15:03.903
<i>You</i> can't?

15:03.938 --> 15:05.805
<i>You</i> can't.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.808
Can... can we at least just talk about it?

15:09.877 --> 15:13.680
I'm not putting us through this anymore.

15:13.714 --> 15:16.649
It's a good place.

15:16.684 --> 15:18.551
For all of us.

15:21.956 --> 15:23.790
It's got three bays.

15:23.824 --> 15:25.758
It needs some paint.

15:25.793 --> 15:26.993
Plenty of parking.

15:33.734 --> 15:35.702
- Where have you been?
- I've been here.

15:35.736 --> 15:38.638
- I-I've been calling and calling and c-can I c...
- Yeah.

15:38.672 --> 15:41.674
Just... I meant I'm trying to
get you engaged in this thing.

15:41.709 --> 15:42.942
I don't care.

15:42.977 --> 15:44.811
I saw that son-of-a-bitch prosecutor,

15:44.845 --> 15:46.946
and y-you better believe I told
him what the hell I thought.

15:46.981 --> 15:48.581
I don't care, Russ.

15:50.217 --> 15:53.686
You don't care about what happened to Matt?

15:53.721 --> 15:54.554
Nothing changes.

15:54.588 --> 15:56.890
Matt's still gone. We're losing Mark.

15:56.924 --> 15:59.993
What? N... but, no, it
doesn't have to be like that.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.529
I mean, that's the thing.
There's an... there's an answer.

16:02.563 --> 16:04.297
I mean, what happened here was horrible,

16:04.331 --> 16:06.032
but something can still come out of this.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.001
We can start putting
our lives back together.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.003
I want you to stay in Modesto.

16:10.037 --> 16:10.837
Why would I stay?

16:10.871 --> 16:13.339
You and me, we've never been closer.

16:13.374 --> 16:14.407
That's the truth.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.808
We can be here with...

16:15.843 --> 16:16.776
With Mark and Richelle.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.212
Mark and Richelle are going back to Germany.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.881
- They don't want anything to do with us.
- Oh, Mark.

16:21.916 --> 16:23.516
You know, I mean, he's just... he's...

16:23.551 --> 16:25.251
- He's going through a...
- No, it's not a stage.

16:25.286 --> 16:26.252
We got it wrong with him.

16:26.287 --> 16:28.588
Mark wanted to help Gwen. That, he would do.

16:28.622 --> 16:30.490
So, they... They can stay in the house.

16:30.524 --> 16:31.891
- Russ...
- And you should see it.

16:31.926 --> 16:32.825
Barb, it's beautiful.

16:32.860 --> 16:35.028
I mean, I really just put everything...

16:35.062 --> 16:36.196
Matt was killed there.

16:36.230 --> 16:37.330
Well, you can't tell.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.098
I mean, it's new floors, new paint.

16:39.133 --> 16:40.667
I mean, it's a <i>real</i> home.

16:40.701 --> 16:43.269
Gwen is going back to
Oakland with Tom and Eve.

16:43.304 --> 16:44.904
They're selling the house.

16:44.939 --> 16:46.039
Well, no, they can't do that.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.740
I'm going back to Simi Valley.

16:47.775 --> 16:50.276
Mark and Richelle are going to Germany.

16:50.311 --> 16:54.113
The only thing that was keeping
us here was something brutal.

16:54.148 --> 16:57.350
It's behind us, and we're scattering.

16:57.384 --> 17:01.854
We need to. We need to
be away from each other.

17:01.889 --> 17:03.623
You need to be away from Mark?

17:03.657 --> 17:04.857
You... you believe that?

17:04.892 --> 17:06.960
- It's how it is.
- "It's how it -"

17:06.993 --> 17:08.728
- I accept it.
- Whwhat is that?

17:08.762 --> 17:10.396
You don't have to accept it.

17:10.431 --> 17:14.400
Y-you... we can... we can
be however we want to be.

17:14.435 --> 17:16.069
Uh, I mean, I'm not kidding myself

17:16.103 --> 17:17.770
that it's gonna be easy or perfect,

17:17.805 --> 17:19.771
and I know the past isn't just done.

17:19.807 --> 17:21.974
But we've... we've got
to fight for this family.

17:22.009 --> 17:22.809
Let go.

17:22.843 --> 17:24.911
No, but, uh, we need to be together.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.378
I mean, I just... I feel that...

17:26.413 --> 17:27.880
Whatever you think is back there,

17:27.915 --> 17:29.382
stop trying to hold onto it.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.583
Well, this isn't about the past.

17:30.618 --> 17:33.319
I'm not trying to make up for
anything or re-live anything.

17:33.354 --> 17:34.787
I've been sitting in his room.

17:34.822 --> 17:36.456
It's empty and it's lonely and it hurts.

17:36.490 --> 17:37.890
- But... this is...
- Don't be lonely.

17:37.925 --> 17:39.759
It's the <i>truth,</i> Russ.

17:39.793 --> 17:41.995
No. No.

17:42.029 --> 17:43.696
No.

17:48.669 --> 17:50.436
No.

17:55.509 --> 17:57.977
Don't be lonely, Barb.

18:00.614 --> 18:02.849
Don't be.

18:02.883 --> 18:07.553
There... there's something...
There's something else for us.

18:10.057 --> 18:11.958
There is.

18:31.912 --> 18:33.846
Let go.

22:06.913 --> 22:07.813
<i>I wanted to let you know</i>

22:07.848 --> 22:10.483
<i>I heard you might be selling the house.</i>

22:10.517 --> 22:12.485
Well, you should look at it.

22:12.519 --> 22:15.821
You can't even tell something
bad happened here.

22:15.856 --> 22:18.958
Look, I put a lot of work into it.

22:18.992 --> 22:21.293
I wish somebody was just

22:21.328 --> 22:25.731
willing to try as hard
for this family as I am.

22:25.766 --> 22:27.733
Yeah, and I just...

22:27.768 --> 22:31.771
I feel like I'm all alone out here.

22:39.746 --> 22:42.014
Oh, geez.

22:43.450 --> 22:45.351
Take
care of your family, Tom.

22:45.385 --> 22:48.687
<i>All the best with Gwen.</i>

22:56.930 --> 23:00.332
I like when dad drives.

23:00.367 --> 23:02.668
Feels safe.

23:08.108 --> 23:09.842
* I lost all of my innocence *

23:09.876 --> 23:14.046
* when I fell in love in with you *

23:14.080 --> 23:16.081
Can I get a pbr?

23:16.116 --> 23:21.921
* I never knew a man fall
so far until I landed here *

23:21.955 --> 23:25.958
* Where all of my wound turn into gold *

23:25.992 --> 23:29.595
* when I kissed your hair *

23:29.629 --> 23:33.732
* come to me, Hannah *

23:33.767 --> 23:39.271
* Hannah, won't you come home to me *

23:39.306 --> 23:43.275
* I'll lay down this bottle of wine *

23:43.310 --> 23:46.946
* if you'll just be kind to me *

24:20.947 --> 24:23.082
Woman: La Loma State Hospital.

24:23.116 --> 24:24.750
Uh, yes.

24:24.784 --> 24:26.819
Can you please put me through to a patient?

24:26.853 --> 24:29.021
She's under observation.

24:29.055 --> 24:30.422
Patient's name?

24:31.825 --> 24:33.592
Hello?

24:33.627 --> 24:34.827
Yeah. Hello?

24:34.861 --> 24:36.595
Aub... Aubry Taylor.

24:36.630 --> 24:39.465
One moment. I'll ring you through.

24:41.868 --> 24:42.868
Aubrey: Hello?

24:42.903 --> 24:43.869
Yeah, Au...

24:46.907 --> 24:49.642
Hello?

24:49.676 --> 24:51.410
Hello?

24:52.412 --> 24:53.946
Carter?

25:33.687 --> 25:37.222
Drop your weapon!

25:37.257 --> 25:40.993
Put the gun down now!

25:41.027 --> 25:43.996
I'm not gonna ask you again!

25:44.030 --> 25:46.899
Drop the weapon!

25:46.933 --> 25:49.368
Drop your weapon!

25:49.796 --> 25:51.964
Woman: Wyatt, have you
seen where Dr. Rose is?

25:51.998 --> 25:53.065
Man: All right, this guy's bleeding.
We got to get started.

25:53.099 --> 25:54.866
Yeah, I'm ready to go.
Gunshot wound is through...

25:56.302 --> 25:57.970
That's good, guys.

25:58.004 --> 26:00.772
Oh, my god, his blood pressure's dropping.

26:00.807 --> 26:02.641
Okay. Get the pressure up.

26:02.675 --> 26:03.775
He's not looking good.

26:03.810 --> 26:05.243
The patient's flatlining.

26:05.278 --> 26:07.546
Hey, Jim? We got no pulse. We got nothing.

26:07.580 --> 26:08.981
We got three doses of epi.

26:09.015 --> 26:10.983
- What time is it?
- 6:30.

26:11.017 --> 26:12.584
Yeah, why don't we call it now.

26:12.618 --> 26:13.618
There's nothing else we can do.

26:13.653 --> 26:14.886
Yes, sir.

26:14.921 --> 26:17.489
We did our best, guys.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.601
Woman: Liz, you want to call security

26:25.635 --> 26:26.835
to meet us in the morgue?

26:45.755 --> 26:48.323
What?

26:48.358 --> 26:49.524
What?

26:49.559 --> 26:51.393
Something happened to your boyfriend.

26:51.427 --> 26:53.028
Something?

26:53.062 --> 26:54.897
He was shot.

26:54.931 --> 26:56.798
Can I see him?

26:56.833 --> 26:57.599
He didn't make it.

26:57.634 --> 27:00.168
Tell the doctors to do something.

27:00.203 --> 27:02.804
There's nothing to do. They worked on him.

27:02.839 --> 27:05.340
Well, go t-tell them to do something else.

27:05.375 --> 27:09.745
Doctors say people are dead
all the time, and they're not.

27:09.779 --> 27:12.147
Go tell them to do something!

27:19.055 --> 27:22.190
Didn't matter what I confessed to.

27:22.225 --> 27:24.026
You wanted him.

27:26.229 --> 27:27.930
You happy now?

27:27.964 --> 27:29.898
- I'm sorry for you.
- Oh, no, you're not.

27:29.933 --> 27:34.670
You come around here and make
me think you give a... about me.

27:34.704 --> 27:36.939
Nobody ever wanted us to be together!

27:36.973 --> 27:38.273
Nobody ever wanted it!

27:38.308 --> 27:40.108
This whole thing happened

27:40.143 --> 27:43.178
because nobody wanted us to be together!

27:45.315 --> 27:48.850
Nobody wants us to be together.

27:56.426 --> 27:59.528
Alonzo: Okay, what's here?

27:59.562 --> 28:01.797
What's here that you want to stay in Modesto

28:01.831 --> 28:03.031
over someplace else?

28:03.066 --> 28:06.201
I don't want to keep running
away from things all the time.

28:06.235 --> 28:07.903
That's what this family does.

28:07.937 --> 28:11.106
Run away from Modesto, run away from Mexico.

28:11.140 --> 28:13.608
We didn't run away from Mexico.

28:13.643 --> 28:15.811
Well, you went somewhere else

28:15.845 --> 28:18.046
'cause you wanted something else.

28:18.081 --> 28:21.950
You stay here, then what?

28:21.985 --> 28:23.452
You know Carlos.

28:23.486 --> 28:26.121
You're staying here for Carlos?

28:26.155 --> 28:28.390
I'm not staying for Carlos.

28:28.424 --> 28:30.058
His family has a restaurant.

28:30.093 --> 28:31.927
- They have a restaurant?
- Really?

28:31.961 --> 28:34.963
You don't know that?

28:34.998 --> 28:39.134
They said I can work there,
make money, pay for school.

28:39.168 --> 28:42.637
Well, that's why I'm trying
to start a new business, mija.

28:42.672 --> 28:44.840
I can make good money.
I'll pay for your school.

28:44.874 --> 28:46.975
You don't have to.

28:47.010 --> 28:48.310
I <i>want</i> to.

28:53.216 --> 28:55.650
But I don't have to.

28:58.021 --> 29:01.923
Maybe I would stay a little bit for Carlos.

29:01.958 --> 29:03.191
You guys are so young.

29:03.226 --> 29:05.427
How old were you when you married mom?

29:05.461 --> 29:07.295
When you left Mexico?

29:09.565 --> 29:11.700
You did all of that, and
you guys turned out good.

29:12.769 --> 29:16.738
All I want to do... I
want to stay in Modesto.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.144
What are you thinking?

29:22.178 --> 29:23.812
I don't even know.

29:23.846 --> 29:26.148
- I'm feeling, uh...
- You should feel happy.

29:26.182 --> 29:28.717
You raised us to take care of ourselves.

29:28.751 --> 29:30.819
I got this.

29:35.725 --> 29:37.292
Ay.

29:37.326 --> 29:41.797
You know, not too long from now,

29:41.831 --> 29:45.367
your little girl is gonna be
sitting here and telling you,

29:45.401 --> 29:48.370
"you should be happy,"

29:48.404 --> 29:51.239
because she...

29:51.274 --> 29:54.342
She's going away.

29:54.377 --> 29:57.379
I'm not going away.

30:09.926 --> 30:12.494
Your mom would be proud.

32:22.158 --> 32:23.658
Ah!

32:25.428 --> 32:28.163
I-i-i... I need help.

32:28.197 --> 32:31.733
I-i need help.

32:31.767 --> 32:34.035
I-i need help! I need... I need help!

32:34.070 --> 32:36.037
Get a doctor! I need help.

32:36.072 --> 32:37.973
I need help. He's breathing.

32:38.007 --> 32:39.207
I need a doctor in here!

32:39.242 --> 32:40.208
I need help.

32:40.243 --> 32:42.177
I need a doctor in here!
I need a doctor in here!

32:42.211 --> 32:43.545
- Do something!

32:43.579 --> 32:44.879
Do something! Do something!

32:44.914 --> 32:46.014
Sir, if you can hear me, nod your head.

32:46.048 --> 32:47.015
Good, good, good.

32:47.049 --> 32:48.383
Stay with me. Keep breathing.

32:48.417 --> 32:50.151
Okay, i need a doctor in here!

32:50.186 --> 32:51.486
Sir, stay with me. Stay with me.

32:51.520 --> 32:52.854
Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.756
I need a doctor in here now!

32:54.790 --> 32:56.758
Stay with me. Stay with me.

32:56.792 --> 33:01.263
I need a doctor in here!
Get a doctor in here now!

33:01.297 --> 33:03.064
Sir, stay with me. That's it.

33:03.099 --> 33:04.432
Come on. Stay with me.

33:04.467 --> 33:07.068
Stay with me. Keep
breathing. Keep breathing.

33:07.103 --> 33:08.336
Stay with me.

33:08.371 --> 33:10.839
Come on. Come on, keep breathing.

33:10.873 --> 33:13.174
Sir... I need a doctor in here!

33:13.209 --> 33:15.410
I need a doctor in here now!

33:15.444 --> 33:18.280
I need a doctor in here!
Someone get a doctor in here!

33:18.314 --> 33:20.215

33:20.249 --> 33:23.218
Somebody get a doctor in
here! I need the crash cart!

33:23.252 --> 33:26.288
She doesn't have a pulse!
I need a crash cart now!

33:26.322 --> 33:28.189
Get a doctor!

34:10.482 --> 34:13.859
Innaa lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji'oon.

34:30.183 --> 34:32.717
Palmer: Someone inside the room
is going to pull back the blind,

34:32.753 --> 34:35.020
and you're going to see a
table with a body on it.

34:35.054 --> 34:38.424
I need you to tell me if the
body you see is your husband.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.192
Let me know when you're ready.

34:52.940 --> 34:55.507
You know that's him.

34:55.542 --> 34:58.678
I still need you to identify the body.

35:01.782 --> 35:03.316
That's...

35:05.118 --> 35:07.119
Russ.

35:11.258 --> 35:14.393
What happened?

35:14.428 --> 35:16.529
It was self-inflicted.

35:30.877 --> 35:34.614
Mark: What are you gonna do with the body?

35:34.648 --> 35:37.783
What am I gonna do with your father?

35:37.818 --> 35:40.620
I suppose... Oakland.

35:40.654 --> 35:43.289
With your brother.

35:43.323 --> 35:47.126
Eve was saying I should go back to Oakland.

35:47.160 --> 35:49.295
Okay. Well, I guess, uh

35:49.329 --> 35:51.097
We should call the funeral home there and...

35:51.131 --> 35:53.099
"We"?

35:53.133 --> 35:54.033
We can help you make plans.

35:54.067 --> 35:55.234
You know, I can talk to our C.E.O. and...

35:55.268 --> 35:56.902
Weren't you very desirous

35:56.937 --> 36:00.239
of being done with your father
and your racist mother?

36:00.273 --> 36:03.309
It's all been...

36:03.343 --> 36:06.312
It's a... show.

36:06.346 --> 36:08.514
Let's just...

36:11.284 --> 36:13.219
It's over now.

36:16.323 --> 36:18.257
Okay.

36:18.291 --> 36:20.726
Okay, if this is what you want.

36:28.435 --> 36:30.436
This is what I want.

37:25.025 --> 37:26.292
Richelle: Mrs. Hanlon!

37:26.326 --> 37:27.226
Mom!

37:27.260 --> 37:29.662
- I-i dropped... my...
- Barb.

37:34.434 --> 37:35.668
It's got to stop.

37:35.702 --> 37:38.170
We can't keep burying this family.

37:38.205 --> 37:41.307
You still got a son. We're
gonna have children.

37:41.341 --> 37:43.709
And you deserve to be in their lives.

37:43.744 --> 37:46.879
And they deserve to be
better than we've been.

37:46.913 --> 37:50.015
Y-you got to decide what
you want from this life.

37:50.050 --> 37:53.819
If you want to hate,
you're gonna hate alone.

38:47.307 --> 38:48.641
Sí.

38:55.849 --> 38:57.616
Sí.

38:57.651 --> 38:59.204
So, we are opening a new call center,

38:59.204 --> 39:01.338
and we are looking to expand our business

39:01.373 --> 39:04.074
further into north America...
The United States, Canada.

39:04.109 --> 39:05.342
Sure.

39:05.377 --> 39:07.311
Being bilingual is important for this job,

39:07.345 --> 39:09.580
but you are also going
to be the primary contact

39:09.614 --> 39:11.315
between the customer and the business.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.316
Right.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.751
So it is also important

39:13.785 --> 39:14.919
that the people we bring on

39:14.953 --> 39:18.322
are not only versed in answering
the customer's questions,

39:18.356 --> 39:20.758
but representing the
company in the best way.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.693
I-i think I can do that.

39:22.727 --> 39:24.995
See, one of the reasons
I really want this job,

39:25.030 --> 39:26.830
i-i know your company is growing,

39:26.865 --> 39:28.599
and i-i know there would
be an opportunity to...

39:28.633 --> 39:30.634
You were previously arrested?

39:31.703 --> 39:32.736
Yes.

39:32.771 --> 39:36.006
And have you ever been
involved in cartels, gangs?

39:36.041 --> 39:37.775
I mean, not... not anymore.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.143
Not anymore?

39:39.177 --> 39:41.612
So, your last full-time job, you...?

39:44.015 --> 39:45.216
Never.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.151
But you're not part of gangs anymore?

40:00.265 --> 40:02.166
Wow.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.468
My girlfriend, right?

40:07.505 --> 40:11.709
See, she asked me if I was tired of my life.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.712
Getting cut up, getting shot.

40:14.746 --> 40:18.582
I tell you for real...

40:18.617 --> 40:20.150
I'm not tired of my life.

40:20.185 --> 40:23.487
I'm... I'm worn out.

40:23.521 --> 40:26.023
See, I know people come
in here all the time,

40:26.057 --> 40:29.026
ask you to take a chance on them.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.895
Tell you how they changed.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.998
See, I don't know from other people,

40:34.032 --> 40:36.734
what makes them do how they do.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.335
But I'm 26 years old,

40:38.370 --> 40:41.238
and all I got to show for
my life is a limp and a scar,

40:41.273 --> 40:45.876
and a 5-year-old girl who needs
her daddy to live straight.

40:45.910 --> 40:48.178
I'm part of nothing anymore.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.747
I'm just trying to get a job.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.260
What's the most education you've had?

41:03.295 --> 41:08.232
Man, I had a little bit of high school.

41:08.266 --> 41:10.467
But... but I like to read a lot.

41:10.502 --> 41:12.436
What do you read?

41:26.851 --> 41:29.820
We have to keep talking English now.

41:29.854 --> 41:31.622
I need to keep practicing.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.993
What'd I say? In English.

41:36.027 --> 41:37.928
You got it!

41:37.962 --> 41:40.397
Aah! Mwah!

41:40.432 --> 41:42.733
- It's good!
- Yeah.

41:42.767 --> 41:44.802
I mean, the best part is, right,

41:44.836 --> 41:47.504
like, every month, they
have, like, a, like a review.

41:47.539 --> 41:50.174
So, like, every month, you...
You could get a promotion.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.575
Wow.

41:51.609 --> 41:53.344
That's good.

41:54.779 --> 41:57.181
You know what? We should go to the store.

41:57.215 --> 41:59.850
I mean, I need a new shirt.

41:59.884 --> 42:01.652
I want to look good on
the first day of work.

42:01.686 --> 42:03.954
You're gonna be on the phone.

42:03.988 --> 42:05.856
You don't need a new shirt.

42:05.890 --> 42:07.491
I mean, I know, but, uh...

42:07.525 --> 42:09.426
But I feel like a new shirt.

42:09.461 --> 42:11.862
You know, I feel, uh...

42:11.896 --> 42:15.032
How do you feel?

42:15.066 --> 42:16.233
Hm?

42:18.670 --> 42:19.036
I feel...

42:20.112 --> 42:24.139
