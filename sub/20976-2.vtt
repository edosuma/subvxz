your fat.
I'm gonna stuff it in your butt.

>> I'm Connie. I'm 27, shh.

01:02.667 --> 01:05.467
And I have way too much junk
in my trunk.

01:05.467 --> 01:08.233
I used to love to stand out,
so I would wear anything

01:08.233 --> 01:11.533
that was big, bright, colorful,
outrageous, anything that's,

01:11.533 --> 01:13.767
like, a fantasy.
When I was little, I said

01:13.767 --> 01:17.633
I want to be a little mermaid.
I still wear

01:17.633 --> 01:20.400
what I wore when I was little.
People say I'm not in reality,

01:20.400 --> 01:25.133
but who wants to be there?
When I was 25, I got pregnant

01:25.133 --> 01:27.500
with my ex-boyfriend,
and then we ended up

01:27.500 --> 01:30.166
getting back together
because we wanted to raise

01:30.166 --> 01:33.033
Noah together.
But when I first had my son,

01:33.033 --> 01:35.533
I went through a serious
depression. My body changed.

01:35.533 --> 01:38.367
Like, my belly was saggy.
Like, I had to stop my princess

01:38.367 --> 01:40.000
stuff.
I just didn't fit

01:40.000 --> 01:43.133
in things anymore,
so I started looking at doctors

01:43.133 --> 01:46.500
to get surgery so that
I could be more attractive.

01:46.500 --> 01:51.033
And I found my friend.
She's like, "Come to my doctor.

01:51.033 --> 01:53.367
He's really great."
So we went to him.

01:53.367 --> 01:55.100
So I said, "I just want
everything to be back the way

01:55.100 --> 01:57.133
that it was," and he was like,
"Oh, that's no problem.

01:57.133 --> 01:58.400
That's easy."
He told me that I could

01:58.400 --> 02:00.500
fix my stomach with laser lipo.
And he was like,

02:00.500 --> 02:02.133
"I'm gonna take your fat.
I'm gonna stuff it in your butt.

02:02.133 --> 02:03.467
We're gonna give you a nice,
round butt."

02:03.467 --> 02:05.433
The day that I went in
for the consultation,

02:05.433 --> 02:07.066
I ended up getting the surgery
the same day.

02:07.066 --> 02:09.066
I really thought that I was
finally gonna go back to

02:09.066 --> 02:10.700
how I looked.
No back chub,

02:10.700 --> 02:14.133
no chub rub in the middle,
so I was so excited.

02:14.133 --> 02:15.734
Right after surgery,
my stomach looked flat,

02:15.734 --> 02:18.533
but my butt--
I didn't like it immediately.

02:18.533 --> 02:21.033
"No, you need to do this again.
I don't like the shape of it

02:21.033 --> 02:23.667
at all," and he was like,
"No, it's just swollen.

02:23.667 --> 02:26.400
It's gonna go down.
It's gonna be fine."

02:26.400 --> 02:29.033
Seven, eight months after,
the doctor was like,

02:29.033 --> 02:31.333
"Okay, if you really hate it
this much, I'll do it again,"

02:31.333 --> 02:33.567
and I let him do me again
because I was just desperate

02:33.567 --> 02:35.166
and thought that it couldn't
get any worse.

02:35.166 --> 02:37.567
He told me that he just had to
add more on top

02:37.567 --> 02:41.266
and then make it more round,
so he redid my lipo,

02:41.266 --> 02:45.600
and then he put all of
that fat into my butt again.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.100
My butt on the bottom, it,
like, feels numb.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.333
It feels like the fat
that he put in there turned hard

02:50.333 --> 02:51.734
or something.
It feels like I have cement

02:51.734 --> 02:53.567
in my butt sometimes.
I went to see

02:53.567 --> 02:56.433
about seven plastic surgeons,
and none of them would fix me.

02:56.433 --> 02:58.567
Then I find out that
he's actually a gynecologist,

02:58.567 --> 03:00.567
so he's not
an actual plastic surgeon.

03:00.567 --> 03:04.500

I grew up
in northern California.

When I was a little girl,
I really didn't notice anything

03:14.100 --> 03:16.767
about my nose,
but definitely started

03:16.767 --> 03:19.700
noticing it more
when I was about 11

03:19.700 --> 03:22.200

I had what I would call

03:22.200 --> 03:25.734

It just didn't fit

03:25.734 --> 03:28.600

went in the first day

and once the bandage came off,

03:43.467 --> 03:45.633
even though it was
still swollen, I loved it.

03:45.633 --> 03:48.367

were changing a little bit.

03:55.467 --> 03:58.500
There grew these two
little horns

03:58.500 --> 04:03.633
from the end on the tip,
and I couldn't breathe as well.

04:03.633 --> 04:06.066
Over the past seven years,
I noticed my nose

04:06.066 --> 04:09.266
was getting worse and worse.
It just slopes down,

04:09.266 --> 04:11.633
and then
these two horns protrude,

04:11.633 --> 04:14.166
and they're not even
symmetrical.

04:14.166 --> 04:17.500

to my junior high school years

04:23.300 --> 04:25.767

is a messed up nose.

the type of collapse
that is seen in Tracy's nose,

07:00.400 --> 07:03.767
that's an indication
that most of the cartilage

07:03.767 --> 07:06.133
has been removed,
and she's gonna need a lot

07:06.133 --> 07:09.300

to keep the nose

from collapsing in the future.

goes here; one goes from
here and goes there.

cut ends of your cartilage

two years.

07:56.567 --> 07:58.667
a larger nose.
I don't want the nose

07:58.667 --> 08:01.433
that I had as a teenager,
but if it's a little bit bigger

08:01.433 --> 08:04.133
but it functions,
then I'm good with that.

08:04.133 --> 08:05.467
Let's do it.
>> Should we do it?

08:05.467 --> 08:06.734
>> I'm excited.
>> Yeah, right?

08:06.734 --> 08:11.667
>> Yeah.
>> I want to suction this down

08:11.667 --> 08:15.700
and suction some of this down,
but there is no instruction book

08:15.700 --> 08:18.633
as to how to do this.
>> Right now, my body is not up

08:18.633 --> 08:21.633
to comic proportions.
I need to go larger

08:21.633 --> 08:32.300
in my breasts
to complete my hero look.

08:32.300 --> 08:34.767
>> My name is Bunny Blaze.
I am 20 years old,

08:34.767 --> 08:39.033
and right now, my body
is not up to comic proportions.

08:39.033 --> 08:43.600
I cosplay, which is making
a comic character

08:43.600 --> 08:46.467
into real life.
I get a lot of my inspiration

08:46.467 --> 08:51.166
from movies and from comics,
and when I'm in character,

08:51.166 --> 08:54.600
I feel like myself.
Growing up, I always was

08:54.600 --> 08:59.100
the bigger girl in school.
I was made fun of quite a bit.

08:59.100 --> 09:02.266
When I hit puberty
and my breasts starting growing,

09:02.266 --> 09:05.734
I was a triple D,
but they had no volume to them,

09:05.734 --> 09:09.100
and they were pretty much flat.
My nipples pointed

09:09.100 --> 09:11.467
to the ground.
It was just really hard.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.600
I was always the girl
in the locker room

09:13.600 --> 09:17.233
with the weird boobs.
My love for comics began

09:17.233 --> 09:19.133
in middle school.
It was something

09:19.133 --> 09:22.667
I always went to
if I felt down or sad.

09:22.667 --> 09:27.333
I like that they could
simply put on a mask or a cape

09:27.333 --> 09:31.266
and they became very heroic,
and people looked up to them.

09:31.266 --> 09:35.233
I attended my first con
about three years ago.

09:35.233 --> 09:39.600
A con is a convention center
where animators,

09:39.600 --> 09:43.300
graphic designers,
and cosplayers get together

09:43.300 --> 09:47.767
and just have fun.
After that, I really wanted

09:47.767 --> 09:52.400
to start being a cosplayer
that people idolized,

09:52.400 --> 09:56.367
so I knew I needed
to start modifying my body,

09:56.367 --> 09:58.400
so I had my first
breast surgery.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.533
When I went into the doctor's,
I wanted to go as big

10:02.533 --> 10:05.767
as I could.
My doctor told me that the size

10:05.767 --> 10:11.000
that he could put inside me
would be 800 overfilled to 850.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.533
I was really happy
when I woke up from surgery.

10:13.533 --> 10:18.100
They sat on my chest very well,
and I was really hoping that

10:18.100 --> 10:21.367
they would actually stay there,
but within a year,

10:21.367 --> 10:25.166
I actually bottomed out
and started to double bubble.

10:25.166 --> 10:29.400
I was absolutely not happy.
I waited about a year

10:29.400 --> 10:32.266
before I decided
that I needed to get

10:32.266 --> 10:35.133
another surgery for my breasts.
When I came out

10:35.133 --> 10:39.066
of the surgery room,
I was told that I had 2,000 CCs,

10:39.066 --> 10:42.567
and I was really happy
with how they were looking.

10:42.567 --> 10:46.000
Surprising I get a lot of people
still confusing

10:46.000 --> 10:49.433
that my boobs are real,
and that's something I'm really

10:49.433 --> 10:54.200
trying to stray away from,
and I still feel like I need

10:54.200 --> 10:58.133
to go larger in my breasts
to complete my hero look.

10:58.133 --> 11:01.533
I will talk to every doctor
in the world

11:01.533 --> 11:04.033
till I'm blue in the face
to achieve the look

11:04.033 --> 11:06.367
that I'm looking for.

11:10.166 --> 11:12.500
>> This next patient, Connie,
comes to us because

11:12.500 --> 11:15.467
she's had a problem related
to a butt augmentation

11:15.467 --> 11:18.734
she had in New York.
This is Connie's pre-op buttock.

11:18.734 --> 11:22.567
It's amazing.
>> Looks pretty nice. Oh, oh!

11:22.567 --> 11:25.166
>> Is that crazy?
Is that super crazy?

11:25.166 --> 11:29.066
>> God!
>> What a disaster this is.

11:29.066 --> 11:32.200
>> Please send in Connie.
>> Connie.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.734
>> Hi!
>> Hi, how are you?

11:33.734 --> 11:35.467
>> Good.
>> I'm Terry Dubrow,

11:35.467 --> 11:37.200
nice to meet you.
>> How are you? Dr. Nassif.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.467
>> Hi, nice to meet you guys.
I'm just so excited to finally

11:40.467 --> 11:43.433
get some answers
about what's going on with

11:43.433 --> 11:45.667
my butt, because everyone has
just flat out told me

11:45.667 --> 11:48.633
that there's no solution,
so I just want a chance

11:48.633 --> 11:51.233
at it being fixed.
>> You had the surgical

11:51.233 --> 11:52.734
procedure you had in
New York, right?

11:52.734 --> 11:54.233
>> Yeah.
>> Was it a board-certified

11:54.233 --> 11:56.667
plastic surgeon?
>> No,

11:56.667 --> 12:00.734
he was actually a gynecologist.
>> He was a gynecologist.

12:00.734 --> 12:02.600
What did he say,
"I'm a cosmetic surgeon

12:02.600 --> 12:05.266
or a plastic surgeon"?
>> I think that's the little

12:05.266 --> 12:07.000
certificate
he had on the wall.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.333
>> Cosmetic surgeon, yeah.
Cosmetic surgeons come from

12:10.333 --> 12:15.533
different fields of medicine,
from rheumatology to radiology

12:15.533 --> 12:20.734
to anything else you can list,
so I'm not being a hater.

12:20.734 --> 12:23.467
I just think that
plastic surgery should be done

12:23.467 --> 12:28.100
by surgeons trained
in the field of plastic surgery.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.433
>> When I first went in,
I came in for a consultation,

12:30.433 --> 12:32.000
but he was like,
"I actually have

12:32.000 --> 12:34.500
an opening today,"
and I was like, "Okay."

12:34.500 --> 12:36.166
>> What?
>> The same day you met him?

12:36.166 --> 12:38.700
>> The same day.
>> If a doctor can operate

12:38.700 --> 12:41.233
on you the same day
he meets you,

12:41.233 --> 12:43.767
he doesn't have any patients,
and if you don't have

12:43.767 --> 12:46.000
any patients,
you're not a very good surgeon.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.400
So you came in thinking
you needed a tummy tuck.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.367
>> Yeah.
>> And the truth is, he probably

12:50.367 --> 12:52.367
didn't do tummy tucks,
'cause he hadn't learned

12:52.367 --> 12:54.166
how to do that one yet.
>> He was like, "We can take

12:54.166 --> 12:55.767
all that fat," and he was like,
"And you know what I can do?

12:55.767 --> 12:58.400
I can put it in your butt."
>> It was his suggestion.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.700
>> Yeah, and so every ounce
of fat that he took out of me

13:00.700 --> 13:03.233
he stuffed in my butt,
because he didn't want

13:03.233 --> 13:04.633
to throw it out
because he said it's too much

13:04.633 --> 13:08.000
of a hassle to throw out.
>> Well, it's expensive.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.567
You can't just dump it
in the trash.

13:09.567 --> 13:11.667
>> So immediately after
I got off the table

13:11.667 --> 13:13.467
and he showed me the picture
of my butt,

13:13.467 --> 13:15.600
I was like, "That is terrible.
What is that?"

13:15.600 --> 13:17.066
>> He goes, "Oh,
it's the swelling.

13:17.066 --> 13:18.533
It's gonna go down,"
and then he tells me,

13:18.533 --> 13:20.166
"Now you're gonna have to wear
a yoga mat."

13:20.166 --> 13:21.567
>> Wanted you to wear
a yoga mat?

13:21.567 --> 13:23.133
What does that--
>> Yeah, how do you do that?

13:23.133 --> 13:24.433
>> How do you wear a yoga mat?
>> So he told me

13:24.433 --> 13:26.667
to get a yoga mat
and bring it into the office,

13:26.667 --> 13:29.133
and then they cut it,
and then you wrap yourself

13:29.133 --> 13:31.667
in it.
Oh, so that wasn't normal?

13:31.667 --> 13:34.133
>> both: No.
>> Asking a patient to wear

13:34.133 --> 13:37.266
a compression garment
after liposuction surgery

13:37.266 --> 13:39.734
is very common.
Asking them to wear

13:39.734 --> 13:43.400
a yoga mat is kind of insane.
>> And then he told me,

13:43.400 --> 13:45.600
"Put a book here."
Then he tells me,

13:45.600 --> 13:49.400
"Put two books on the side
of your butt to keep it up."

13:49.400 --> 13:51.066
>> What books did you use?
>> I hope this guy

13:51.066 --> 13:52.333
lost his license.
>> Dr. Seuss.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.567
>> I would've used
a horror novel.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.200
This is terrible.
>> So did the swelling go down?

13:57.200 --> 13:59.233
Did anything change?
>> It got worse.

13:59.233 --> 14:01.734
>> This is the most
preposterous story

14:01.734 --> 14:05.033
in regards to medical treatment
and surgery that I ever heard

14:05.033 --> 14:07.700
of in my entire life.
>> The second time I went back,

14:07.700 --> 14:11.033
he put more fat in my butt.
>> So you let him

14:11.033 --> 14:13.033
do lipo on you again.
>> I was like,

14:13.033 --> 14:14.467
"I just want it fixed,"
and now it looks like

14:14.467 --> 14:16.467
an actual heart.
>> You had surgery

14:16.467 --> 14:19.333
at the little shop of horrors.
>> I did.

14:19.333 --> 14:22.467
I'm just hoping you guys
can just give me back two nice,

14:22.467 --> 14:25.633
round--a round butt.
>> I don't know

14:25.633 --> 14:28.600
what the solution is,
but hopefully we will know more

14:28.600 --> 14:30.233
when we see you
in the examination room.

14:30.233 --> 14:32.600
>> Hope you guys are ready.
>> Let's go do it.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.500
>> Okay.
>> This is it or nothing.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.500
I'm either
gonna have to go in there,

14:37.500 --> 14:39.367
and they're gonna tell me
they can or cannot help me,

14:39.367 --> 14:41.233
and if they can't,
I'm gonna have to find

14:41.233 --> 14:44.000
a way to live with this.
>> Let's look at your buttock

14:44.000 --> 14:46.200
and look at the dimensions
of your buttock, okay?

14:46.200 --> 14:48.600
>> Oh, they're large dimensions.
>> All right, so first you

14:48.600 --> 14:52.633
had liposuction done
on your tummy.

14:52.633 --> 14:54.500
>> Mm-hmm.
>> And then he did liposuction--

14:54.500 --> 14:56.133
>> On my back.
>> Flank here.

14:56.133 --> 15:01.767
So what all this fat has done
is really grossly changed

15:01.767 --> 15:04.333
the shape of your buttock,
which it's not supposed to do,

15:04.333 --> 15:08.400
and it has stretched out
and altered your skin.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.767
We can do some liposuction
to try

15:10.767 --> 15:13.467
to reduce the overall volume.
We have to be very careful

15:13.467 --> 15:16.433
with that liposuction,
'cause if we over-suction you,

15:16.433 --> 15:19.000
we will change the laxity
of the skin

15:19.000 --> 15:23.100
and change this shape
and make it worse.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.000
The buttock is
a lot like a beach ball:

15:25.000 --> 15:30.133
if you take air out of it,
it loses its shape entirely,

15:30.133 --> 15:35.233
so liposuction alone
is not really a good solution

15:35.233 --> 15:39.500
to changing the volume
and shape of the buttock.

15:39.500 --> 15:44.100
I want to get what we recognize
as a regular buttock shape back.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.533
If I can do this...
>> Yes.

15:46.533 --> 15:49.533
>> With an incision in here,
tucking in there,

15:49.533 --> 15:53.367
and I want to suction this down
and suction some of this down.

15:53.367 --> 15:59.400
But there is no instruction book
as to how to do this.

15:59.400 --> 16:02.567
We are making this up
as we go along

16:02.567 --> 16:05.433
to a certain degree.
>> You are my last and only

16:05.433 --> 16:07.300
hope.
Everyone has told me no,

16:07.300 --> 16:11.066
so hopefully
we can put this mess behind me

16:11.066 --> 16:15.166
and move on with my life.

So with Connie,
I really have to sort of undo

18:51.133 --> 18:54.066
what's been done.
What we identify as a normal

18:54.066 --> 18:58.166
below inferior buttock crease
has been obliterated, and now

18:58.166 --> 19:02.266
it's got a very unusual shape,
so I want to reverse that.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.533
For Connie's surgery today,
I will start by performing

19:05.533 --> 19:08.333
liposuction on the buttock
to remove excess fat,

19:08.333 --> 19:11.166
reducing the volume
and overall

19:11.166 --> 19:13.667
the size of her buttock.
Next I'll make incisions

19:13.667 --> 19:16.033
at the gluteal creases
above her thighs,

19:16.033 --> 19:19.333
tightening the loose skin
to give her a normal contour.

19:19.333 --> 19:22.400
Number one, I think we have
to suction a certain minimum

19:22.400 --> 19:25.567
of fat from each cheek,
so let's start out with 500

19:25.567 --> 19:29.066
CCs per cheek
and see what that does to

19:29.066 --> 19:31.700
the overall skin envelope
and the laxity

19:31.700 --> 19:38.600
of the surrounding skin.
[suction whirring]

19:38.600 --> 19:41.734
I mean, to me, this looks like
about 200 CCs of fat,

19:41.734 --> 19:46.300
maybe 250, doesn't it?
The more I do,

19:46.300 --> 19:48.767
the greater the chance the skin
will be loose, and the shape

19:48.767 --> 19:55.367
will be made even worse.
Oh, that's already, what, 400?

19:55.367 --> 19:58.233

the fat at the very bottom

19:58.233 --> 20:00.633
of the buttock area here,
which you never do.

20:00.633 --> 20:04.567
The idea with a Brazilian
butt lift is that you're trying

20:04.567 --> 20:06.667
to increase the projection of
the buttock.

20:06.667 --> 20:09.633
In order to do that,
you basically transfer fat

20:09.633 --> 20:12.333
to the upper portions
of the buttock.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.500
If you transfer it
to the lower portions, it makes

20:14.500 --> 20:17.667
the buttock look longer,
and that's not a good cosmetic

outcome.

20:25.233 --> 20:28.767
because if you change
the shape of the buttock,

20:28.767 --> 20:32.400
there's no going back,
but we have no choice.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.467
So how much have
we suctioned so far?

20:34.467 --> 20:37.333
>> 1,600 out of the left
and 1,400 out of the right,

20:37.333 --> 20:39.667
so 3,000.
>> 3,000 total.

20:39.667 --> 20:44.100
Connie has so much fat in her
buttock that

20:44.100 --> 20:48.567
I'm almost reaching the maximum
that's physiologically

20:48.567 --> 20:51.667
allowable in order
not to disrupt her vital signs.

20:51.667 --> 20:55.667
Okay, so that's kind of
a good shape, greatly reduced.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.700
The only problem is,
we have--we starting

20:57.700 --> 21:00.667
to get some skin laxity,
so I think we're gonna

21:00.667 --> 21:03.533
have to remove some skin
in that lower part

21:03.533 --> 21:07.300
near the inside of the legs
and see what that

21:07.300 --> 21:09.500
contour looks like, okay?
Scalpel.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.233
This is sort of another
no-no in buttock surgery.

21:12.233 --> 21:14.233
You generally don't make
incisions on the

21:14.233 --> 21:20.233
infragluteal crease here,
but in this case,

21:20.233 --> 21:23.767
it's the only solution.
Normally we don't remove skin

21:23.767 --> 21:26.100
from the gluteal crease
'cause it's hard to make it

21:26.100 --> 21:29.133
a perfect curve,
but in Connie's case,

21:29.133 --> 21:31.166
I kind of have to break
all the rules.

21:31.166 --> 21:35.133
That should work, right?
Okay, I think

21:35.133 --> 21:39.166
we suctioned as much
as we could possibly suction

21:39.166 --> 21:41.000
without loosening the skin
too much,

21:41.000 --> 21:45.133
so I think we improved her.
How much? I have no idea.

21:45.133 --> 21:47.467
We won't know until we still her
post-operatively

21:47.467 --> 21:50.300
and standing up, but I think
this is a good improvement.

21:50.300 --> 21:53.333
It certainly looks a lot better.
The good news is, I removed

21:53.333 --> 21:55.300
a lot of fat
from each of Connie's

21:55.300 --> 21:58.300
buttock cheeks,
and that in and of itself

21:58.300 --> 22:00.200
should restore
her buttock to normal.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.133
I think that at the end
of the day,

22:03.133 --> 22:05.433
it's gonna look pretty good,
and I think she'll be happy

22:05.433 --> 22:11.633

22:34.500 --> 22:36.567

22:36.567 --> 22:39.333
but I think the upside
is that today's the day

22:39.333 --> 22:42.200
that Dr. Nassif is gonna fix it,
and it's gonna be better.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.333
>> Today we're doing Tracy,
and the issue

22:44.333 --> 22:47.367
that makes her nose is hard
is that she has these two things

22:47.367 --> 22:49.033
called bossae.
They're causing

22:49.033 --> 22:52.166
these little bulges in the skin.
It's very difficult to fix these

22:52.166 --> 22:54.533
because to try to get
the contour

22:54.533 --> 22:58.367
absolutely smooth along the skin
when you have those bossae

22:58.367 --> 23:01.367
is difficult,
and we just have to hope

23:01.367 --> 23:04.200
that it heals well.
My plan for Tracy today is

23:04.200 --> 23:06.500
to first take composite grafts
from both ears

23:06.500 --> 23:08.734
and harvest some rib.
And next I'll dissect out

23:08.734 --> 23:12.100
the two bossae formations
and perform a septoplasty

23:12.100 --> 23:15.200
to correct her deviated septum.
And lastly, I will smooth

23:15.200 --> 23:17.266
out the dorsum
and use the composite grafts

23:17.266 --> 23:21.333
from the ears to reconstruct
the tip and lower her nostrils.

23:21.333 --> 23:26.400
Okay, so we've harvested
composite grafts from both ears.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.266
We got a piece of rib, Don?
I did. It's a nice one,

23:29.266 --> 23:32.367
but I don't think
it's calcified either,

23:32.367 --> 23:34.400
so you'll have some good grafts.
>> All right, then let's give

23:34.400 --> 23:39.166
that to Dr. Kevin,
Mr. graft extraordinaire.

23:39.166 --> 23:42.000
Now let's start the nose.
I'm really interested to see

23:42.000 --> 23:43.533
what this cartilage
in the tip looks like.

23:43.533 --> 23:45.767
>> Me too.
You're almost like

23:45.767 --> 23:48.367
a time traveler.
[laughs]

23:48.367 --> 23:51.500
>> It's not often
that I get to open up a nose

23:51.500 --> 23:54.133
that was touched 30 years ago,
so this is

23:54.133 --> 23:57.500
a pretty cool experience.
So thin, thin, thin skin.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.033
That's why you have to be
a little bit careful,

23:59.033 --> 24:01.500
because, you know, one wrong
little cut,

24:01.500 --> 24:06.633
you're right through the skin.
Oh, gosh.

24:06.633 --> 24:12.033
You know, the doctor removed
about 80% of normal anatomy,

24:12.033 --> 24:14.100
but at this point, you know,
we have to make this nose

24:14.100 --> 24:17.133
look normal again.
I have to put a large amount

24:17.133 --> 24:20.133
of cartilage in the tip
in an area where she has really,

24:20.133 --> 24:24.133
really thin skin.
That means any bump,

24:24.133 --> 24:26.533
any little wrong edge,
hard edge, soft edge,

24:26.533 --> 24:30.133
anything is gonna be seen right
through Tracy's skin,

24:30.133 --> 24:32.600
so we'd better make sure
that that cartilage

24:32.600 --> 24:36.000
is absolutely perfect.
Okay, let's see what's

24:36.000 --> 24:39.200
underneath this mangled
piece of cartilage of the tip.

24:39.200 --> 24:43.667
Oh, my goodness, it's all scar.
Right now, we're trying

24:43.667 --> 24:46.533
to dissect these little weird,
abnormal pieces of cartilage

24:46.533 --> 24:49.533
so we can put normal cartilage
right around it.

24:49.533 --> 24:53.300
It's just a little bit hard,
because I can't really see

24:53.300 --> 24:57.400
what's happening,
so we're kind of guess-timating

24:57.400 --> 25:00.433
where the cartilage is.
This is when surgery gets hairy.

25:00.433 --> 25:02.166
Right now,
I'm having a hard time

25:02.166 --> 25:05.166
deciphering what's cartilage
and what's scar tissue,

25:05.166 --> 25:07.467
and this is definitely
a speed bump in the process,

25:07.467 --> 25:09.734
but I just got to keep going.
Got to get it done.

25:09.734 --> 25:13.066
Okay, so our next step
is reconstructing the nostrils,

25:13.066 --> 25:15.700
and these grafts
are what keep the nostrils open.

25:15.700 --> 25:18.166
We've just finished
fixing the airway,

25:18.166 --> 25:21.467
fixing the septum,
making the tip look good,

25:21.467 --> 25:24.734
softening the dorsum.
I want to put one more graft

25:24.734 --> 25:27.300
in the tip just to give it
a little better look.

25:27.300 --> 25:32.567
Don, stitch in the rim graft.
Put it all the way down, though,

25:32.567 --> 25:36.033
because--lookit.
You need to pop that puppy out.

25:36.033 --> 25:39.033
I think I nailed this nose.
I got about an 85% improvement,

25:39.033 --> 25:41.767
and with that skin,
that's a home run.

25:41.767 --> 25:44.633
Now we just got to make sure
Tracy does a good job healing.

25:44.633 --> 25:46.633
Great job.

You have 2,000 CC implants.
Okay, so you had incisions made

30:59.233 --> 31:02.233
through the areola under here,
so here's the question:

31:02.233 --> 31:06.567
how tight are they?
They're pretty tight.

31:06.567 --> 31:10.200
Bunny's skin is very thin
and is getting stretched

31:10.200 --> 31:13.333
to the absolute limit.
If she goes any bigger, she has

31:13.333 --> 31:16.734
a high risk of developing
a uni-boob or a symmastia.

31:16.734 --> 31:19.767
Your goal is
to be high and fuller.

31:19.767 --> 31:22.133
>> Yes.
>> Okay, so let me ask you

31:22.133 --> 31:25.200
a question, okay?
We have sat dozens and dozens

31:25.200 --> 31:28.367
and dozens of patients
on this very exam chair,

31:28.367 --> 31:30.367
and we tell them,
"Do not do this thing," and they

31:30.367 --> 31:33.600
go, "Uh-huh, yeah, right.
Whatever."

31:33.600 --> 31:36.200
And they go do it.
What are the chances that

31:36.200 --> 31:38.266
you're still gonna go bigger,
you're still gonna do this

31:38.266 --> 31:40.233
operation?
On a scale of one to ten,

31:40.233 --> 31:41.533
what are the chances
you're gonna do that?

31:41.533 --> 31:43.600
>> Very likely.
>> A ten.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.633
>> Yeah.
>> Okay, well, you know,

31:45.633 --> 31:49.500
here's the problem we have.
I want to give you advice, okay?

31:49.500 --> 31:52.367
I'm gonna give you
two kinds of pieces of advice.

31:52.367 --> 31:55.133
My first piece of advice that
I'd love for you to follow is,

31:55.133 --> 31:58.500
don't do any more surgery.
This is as much as your body

31:58.500 --> 32:02.100
is going to tolerate.
The next step from here

32:02.100 --> 32:05.667
is the implant thinning
the skin, showing through,

32:05.667 --> 32:08.367
getting infected,
and most likely turning you

32:08.367 --> 32:15.367
into a breast cripple.
However, if you are

32:15.367 --> 32:19.266
going to do
the next set of procedures

32:19.266 --> 32:22.633
to go larger,
there's really only one way

32:22.633 --> 32:25.300
I would recommend you do that,
and I don't recommend you

32:25.300 --> 32:26.567
do that.
I recommend

32:26.567 --> 32:30.000
strongly you don't do that,
but the best course of action,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.533
honestly:
take these implants out,

32:33.533 --> 32:37.467
let them rest for six months
to a year,

32:37.467 --> 32:40.300
and then go bigger.
You know what that will do?

32:40.300 --> 32:43.133
That will reinforce
the thickness of your skin.

32:43.133 --> 32:45.033
That will give you--because
your envelope

32:45.033 --> 32:46.467
will have shrunk down
and be tighter,

32:46.467 --> 32:49.533
that will give you a lift
without having to do a lift

32:49.533 --> 32:52.667
with scars on the outside,
'cause if you do a lift

32:52.667 --> 32:55.700
with bigger implants,
I promise you

32:55.700 --> 32:59.033
that's gonna be a disaster.
Guarantee it.

32:59.033 --> 33:01.133
>> I don't even want to try to
imagine

33:01.133 --> 33:04.667
what my breasts would look like
at this point without implants.

33:04.667 --> 33:08.000
That's a scary thought.
>> Once you have a complication

33:08.000 --> 33:10.667
like this, there is no reversal.
You can't just--"Well,

33:10.667 --> 33:12.433
I'll take care of it,
and I'll be fine."

33:12.433 --> 33:15.667

You'll never be the same.

40:54.300 --> 40:56.500
after the whole thing?
>> I feel great, actually.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.266
Like, I feel like literally
a weight was lifted off my butt.

40:59.266 --> 41:01.300
>> Yeah.
>> And it's like I can feel--

41:01.300 --> 41:03.166
I can feel myself again, like...
>> I know. Turn around.

41:03.166 --> 41:05.400
>> It's like I'm there.
>> Yes!

41:05.400 --> 41:07.433
>> It feels really good
to have Mikey here now,

41:07.433 --> 41:09.600
because he never lies to me,
so when I look good,

41:09.600 --> 41:12.033
it's like--it's like,
"Yeah, you got it." We're back.

41:12.033 --> 41:14.433
The bunny's back.
>> It doesn't look heavy

41:14.433 --> 41:16.266
anymore either.
>> It's not.

41:16.266 --> 41:19.300
Now it's like--I don't feel--
I'm not, like, numb.

41:19.300 --> 41:20.667
>> Yeah.
>> It's like--it's crazy.

41:20.667 --> 41:24.166
It's really crazy.
I am really happy about my butt.

41:24.166 --> 41:27.166
I can't believe it sometimes.
I'm just like, "Oh, my goodness.

41:27.166 --> 41:29.567
Like, it's back to being
what it was before."

41:29.567 --> 41:32.133
Like, I finally get to put
an end to the storm in my life.

41:32.133 --> 41:34.066
Can you believe
I fit in my jeans again?

41:34.066 --> 41:37.533
>> I do. I love it.
>> I wore these in high school.

41:37.533 --> 41:39.333
>> Nah.
>> Look, isn't it crazy?

41:39.333 --> 41:42.300
>> Yes, it is.
>> Before my surgery, there was

41:42.300 --> 41:44.433
way too much junk in my trunk,
and it was heart-shaped

41:44.433 --> 41:47.567
and bulky and awful.
It was so uncomfortable

41:47.567 --> 41:50.433
and so frustrating,
but now my trunk has shrunk

41:50.433 --> 41:54.100
because there's no much junk.
Dr. Dubrow was totally different

41:54.100 --> 41:57.166
than when I was over there.
Like, I was terrified of doctors

41:57.166 --> 41:59.367
after my first experience,
but, like, after Dr. Dubrow,

41:59.367 --> 42:01.467
it's like, "Oh, is this what
it's supposed to be like?

42:01.467 --> 42:05.700
Because what was
I doing wrong back home?"

42:05.700 --> 42:08.633
>> Clearly you weren't thinking.
>> I never thought that there

42:08.633 --> 42:10.734
was gonna be anybody
who would be able to, like,

42:10.734 --> 42:14.467
fix what I felt, like, inside.
Like, literally, like,

42:14.467 --> 42:18.300
the pain--the cosmetic part,
like--everyone told me no,

42:18.300 --> 42:20.700
that it was gonna be impossible,
but, like, I didn't think that

42:20.700 --> 42:23.734
I would be able to feel again
and it be normal,

42:23.734 --> 42:27.066
and like--just like--it's
just like--I feel

42:27.066 --> 42:29.066
like I'm back to how God made me
in the first place.

42:29.066 --> 42:31.066
I just want to say thank you
so much,

42:31.066 --> 42:34.200
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow,
for actually deciding,

42:34.200 --> 42:35.500
"I'm gonna take
on this challenge,"

42:35.500 --> 42:37.266
and doing it,
because you completely,

42:37.266 --> 42:39.333
completely changed my life.
>> So are you happy

42:39.333 --> 42:41.767
you can run around and not--
>> And I can just bounce again.

42:41.767 --> 42:44.066
>> Yeah.
>> Yes.

42:44.066 --> 42:46.767
>> So how about we bounce
to the balls?

42:46.767 --> 42:49.367
[laughter]
>> Like, I'm ready to go

42:49.367 --> 42:50.734
dancing.
Now that I don't have

42:50.734 --> 42:53.066
anything holding me back,
I'm back to being me,

42:53.066 --> 42:55.633
and it feels great.
I feel like I'm a unicorn again,

42:55.633 --> 42:57.633
and I can just ride off
on a rainbow,

42:57.633 --> 43:01.600
leaving a trail of glitter.
Oh, I did it!

43:01.600 --> 43:07.033
I've never made it in before.
>> I love it.

43:07.033 --> 43:08.700
>> Look at the result
of one surgery.

43:08.700 --> 43:11.533
They're so dramatically...
>> Right.

43:11.533 --> 43:13.500
>> Different.
I've probably done over 10,000

43:13.500 --> 43:16.500
cases of breast surgery--
I've never seen that before.

43:16.500 --> 43:19.567
>> I'm the first transgendered
urban mens' magazine model.

43:19.567 --> 43:21.633
And the doctor said "I will
saw your cheekbones."

43:21.633 --> 43:23.500
>> Wait. Whoa whoa, whoa.
At age 14?

43:23.500 --> 43:26.767
>> Yeah, at 14.
>> Oh.

43:26.767 --> 43:29.367
>> She's a breast cripple.
There's an area right here

43:29.367 --> 43:32.233
that's actually right on top
of the bone.

43:32.233 --> 43:35.133
You have been nuked.
>> I feel nuked.

43:35.133 --> 43:37.100
>> If you'd like to be
considered for "Botched,"
