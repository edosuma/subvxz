00:08.720 --> 00:12.439
There is nothing concealed
that will not be disclosed,

00:12.759 --> 00:15.880
or hidden that will not be made known.
(Luke 12:2)

00:29.960 --> 00:32.399
How did you know Merta?

00:32.719 --> 00:36.640
- Business contacts.
- You didn't write about him.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.079
I was planning to.

00:39.399 --> 00:41.640
Stop lying. We have witnesses.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.600
You met him at the station
and he killed himself a moment later.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.520
- I told you I was there by coincidence.
- Just like me.

00:49.880 --> 00:53.399
I chat with a man and bam!
He's under the train. You too?

00:53.719 --> 00:58.119
For fuck's sake, find the guy
who filmed us from the next platform!

00:58.479 --> 01:01.399
But you were the one
standing near Merta.

01:01.719 --> 01:04.640
Adrian Bogusz. How did you know him?

01:04.959 --> 01:06.879
I didn't.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.359
- Once again?
- What does it tell us?

01:30.879 --> 01:33.640
- You make sure they kill themselves?
- You nuts?

01:33.719 --> 01:36.319
- You knew they'd die.
- Tell us everything.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.840
- Where did you get it?
- Daniel, Bogusz, Merta: what's the link?

01:39.920 --> 01:42.599
- Where did you get it?
- Not your fucking business.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.000
What shit are you trying to get me into?

02:02.040 --> 02:04.920
You can't take the suspect away
just like that.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.439
We took over the investigation
half an hour ago.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.080
Ask your superiors. Thank you.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.400
You can go.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.240
Weronika is at the Central Station.

02:40.080 --> 02:43.599
- I tried to take her home but failed.
- What's wrong?

02:44.960 --> 02:48.599
Your nephew went missing.
She's looking for him there.

02:48.919 --> 02:51.039
- Missing?
- I'm not sure.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.280
I couldn't understand what she said.

02:56.280 --> 02:59.919
She's in a terrible state.
She needs help.

THE PACT

EPISODE 5: THE DISCOVERY

05:03.079 --> 05:05.000
Hi, Ewa.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.480
Look, we need to talk.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.800
No, calm down.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.600
We don't know anything yet
but we will find him.

05:29.959 --> 05:32.399
Piotr, let's go and see her.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.160
What happened? Can you explain it to me?

05:58.519 --> 06:03.040
I don't know what happened.
He went to the toilet and disappeared.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.279
- You were to watch over him.
- I'm sorry.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.519
- It's not her fault.
- And you promised he'd be safe.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.279
Yes, who's that?

06:16.360 --> 06:18.480
I want to talk to him.

06:22.920 --> 06:26.319
All right but I want to talk to him,
you hear me?

06:28.920 --> 06:30.920
What's going on?

06:31.240 --> 06:33.759
He's fine, we just have to wait.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.040
Wait?

06:36.360 --> 06:38.079
Fuck you.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.720
- Who do you want to call?
- The police.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.959
Please, don't.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.439
Don't do it.

06:45.759 --> 06:47.959
I promise I'll find him.

07:09.839 --> 07:12.639
Ewa, take a look, please.
Do you recognise anyone?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.920
No.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.279
Please, take a look.
This is all we've got.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.439
I don't know anyone.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.480
You know something, don't you?

07:34.800 --> 07:36.720
Sorry?

07:37.399 --> 07:39.720
Did you find anything?

07:40.040 --> 07:41.959
Where?

07:43.600 --> 07:46.399
On the pen drive from the notary.

07:47.879 --> 07:50.600
- We couldn't open it.
- You're lying.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.319
It's not the best moment, believe me.

08:00.959 --> 08:02.879
Dad! Dad!

08:30.199 --> 08:32.120
Hold on.

08:45.159 --> 08:47.399
Where's the photo?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.720
Look.

08:57.519 --> 09:00.440
- It's the same.
- You know where it was taken?

09:00.759 --> 09:03.200
The village of Krzyże in Mazury.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.559
Here?

09:12.159 --> 09:13.879
This is it.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.519
It was taken eight months ago.
They must have rebuilt it.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.960
Let's go there.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.759
...the new tapping scandal,

09:51.080 --> 09:54.720
into which the Prosecutor's Office
has launched an investigation.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.960
The recorded meetings were attended
by Minister of Economy Dariusz Skalski.

09:59.279 --> 10:01.399
What's going on?

10:01.720 --> 10:06.360
...Pek-War's owners, Adrian Bogusz
and Tomasz Nawrot, offered him a bribe.

10:22.559 --> 10:25.960
It will be better this way.
At least for now.

10:30.399 --> 10:33.320
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

10:40.519 --> 10:42.720
Take care of yourself.

11:12.159 --> 11:14.360
Leave it at that.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.720
Those people abduct children
and kill them.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.240
I forbid you, do you understand?

11:24.559 --> 11:27.480
They abducted Kuba before my very eyes.

11:27.799 --> 11:31.720
- You can't protect...
- I know! Just help me!

11:44.759 --> 11:47.679
Those people are powerful.

11:59.320 --> 12:03.840
Fine. Tomorrow, quietly,
I'll implement the necessary procedures.

12:04.159 --> 12:06.879
But on one condition: you let it go.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.120
It's here.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.639
- Are we going in?
- Hold on.

14:01.519 --> 14:03.720
Look, I found something.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.559
In 1994, the hut was bought
by Tomasz Nawrot.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.840
Nawrot?
Has he been the owner all this time?

14:11.440 --> 14:14.960
No. In 1996, he transferred it
to a man named Kowalski.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.440
But it's some bullshit.

14:19.639 --> 14:21.240
Ewa!

14:21.879 --> 14:24.600
I'll call you
when we find anything. Bye.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.440
What the fuck...?

17:57.319 --> 17:59.440
There's a safe.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.440
Where did you get this key?

18:20.759 --> 18:22.880
Daniel's study.

18:33.759 --> 18:36.079
- Yes?
- What's going on?

18:40.240 --> 18:44.759
Don't take anything with you.
It might have a tracking device.

18:45.079 --> 18:47.319
Connect it to your laptop.

18:54.519 --> 18:58.039
- It won't open.
- Wait a sec. I'll connect with you.

19:13.440 --> 19:16.160
I'm copying it all onto my computer.

19:21.200 --> 19:24.720
- What are these?
- Documents. Quite a lot.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.599
Dad!

19:36.119 --> 19:38.359
- Turn it off.
- Wait.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.400
Let me go! Fuck!

20:19.400 --> 20:21.319
Fuck off, will you?

20:45.759 --> 20:48.079
Let's get out of here.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.920
Stop the car, please.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.920
Stop the car!

22:55.039 --> 22:57.559
Good Friday

23:34.839 --> 23:38.160
Are you sure
the Prime Minister wanted to see me now?

23:38.480 --> 23:40.799
Yes. He should be here soon.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.240
Minister Skalski unwilling to quit

24:02.640 --> 24:05.160
THE PM'S CONFERENCE IN SEJM

24:13.279 --> 24:17.480
I'm certain that Minister Skalski
crossed certain boundaries.

24:17.799 --> 24:21.920
Our expectations of someone
who represents the government

24:22.279 --> 24:24.599
should be heightened.

24:24.920 --> 24:28.839
Let's wait for all the circumstances
to be explained.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.279
But one thing is clear to me.

24:31.599 --> 24:36.839
A person involved in a bribery scandal
must not hold any position in my Cabinet.

24:38.759 --> 24:43.480
There are standards I'll adhere to
as long as I'm the Prime Minister.

24:43.799 --> 24:46.720
Certainly, the scandal doesn't affect

24:47.079 --> 24:51.200
my high appraisal
of Minister Skalski's work to date.

24:51.519 --> 24:56.039
Yet, given the current situation,
he can't possibly continue his mission.

24:56.359 --> 24:59.880
Soon, I'll give you the name
of the new minister.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.039
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

25:14.359 --> 25:17.480
Everyone from Konary is here.
Only Nawrot is missing.

25:18.720 --> 25:21.039
Maybe he held the camera.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.920
- Is Elżbieta there with you?
- No.

25:25.240 --> 25:28.759
But she left me a colleague of hers.
Don't worry, I'm safe.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.599
Get some rest. We've got them. Bye.

25:43.519 --> 25:45.519
Let me go! Fuck!

26:21.680 --> 26:24.400
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

26:24.720 --> 26:27.039
Why don't you take a seat?

26:34.920 --> 26:36.839
And?

26:38.960 --> 26:41.079
Who do you work for?

26:45.279 --> 26:48.519
Thank you for the offer
but I'm not going to take it.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.960
You're an excellent negotiator.

26:52.799 --> 26:55.119
We are not negotiating.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.880
Everything has its price, as they say.

26:58.599 --> 27:01.720
Now I understand it.
I offended you with too low a fee.

27:02.359 --> 27:04.559
Not everything has its price.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.319
I don't think you realise...

27:11.640 --> 27:13.960
This is my final answer.

27:14.279 --> 27:17.400
And please pass it to your employers.

27:19.119 --> 27:21.359
Whoever they are.

27:21.680 --> 27:24.319
Sir, I haven't told you everything.

27:24.640 --> 27:27.039
You don't realise what opportunities...

27:27.599 --> 27:29.519
Good day!

28:00.200 --> 28:02.319
Monika, come! Quick!

28:04.640 --> 28:09.519
...you become a silent partner.
Such a guarantee is good enough for...

28:09.599 --> 28:12.119
- What's he doing?
- Defending Skalski.

28:12.440 --> 28:16.759
- What money are we talking about?
- If we sign the deal with the Chinese...

28:17.079 --> 28:20.519
Let's say this...
And then twenty percent of the profit.

28:20.839 --> 28:24.480
Gentlemen, this sounds amazing
but I'm a State official.

28:24.799 --> 28:27.519
What's it got to do with anything?

28:27.839 --> 28:30.960
Because I'll start striking such deals
when I retire.

28:31.279 --> 28:33.720
Shame. Are you sure?

28:34.039 --> 28:36.359
Yes, and let's finish this conversation.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.799
What the hell is this?

28:39.160 --> 28:41.559
How about some dessert, honest sir?

28:41.880 --> 28:44.319
All right. I'm in.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.880
Interesting... Pity it means so little.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.799
Everyone can present
‘their own' recording now.

28:50.519 --> 28:53.640
- But the original audio is this one.
- Because you say so?

28:53.960 --> 28:57.880
Because I was there.
And that's what an expert opinion says.

28:58.519 --> 29:01.240
To be precise,
two independent opinions that I ordered.

29:01.559 --> 29:06.079
Kurier should be ordering the third one.
They might do something useful for once.

29:06.440 --> 29:10.960
What difference does it make to you?
You did offer a bribe to the Minister.

29:11.720 --> 29:16.359
That's true. But since the Minister
turned out to be extremely honest,

29:16.960 --> 29:19.480
why should I drag him to the bottom?

29:19.799 --> 29:24.319
Believe me: the truth about who pulls
the strings here is more interesting.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.880
Enough of the conspiracy of silence.

29:27.559 --> 29:31.759
Time to ring the curtain up.
Let's get the party started.

29:33.599 --> 29:35.799
That's fucking lovely. Come on.

29:44.920 --> 29:47.559
- Don't tell them anything.
- Who are they?

29:47.880 --> 29:50.480
The police but I don't know
whose side they're on.

29:55.720 --> 29:57.799
What do you want?

29:57.880 --> 30:00.519
- Ms Grodecka, we'd like to talk to you.
- What about?

30:00.839 --> 30:04.240
- Are you her attorney?
- The CBI took over the case, got it?

30:04.599 --> 30:07.799
We're here about your son.
Please come with us to the station.

30:08.519 --> 30:10.599
- She won't go.
- We have a summons.

30:10.680 --> 30:12.599
Great but she won't go anywhere.

30:13.039 --> 30:15.160
Who put you on this case anyway?

30:20.160 --> 30:21.880
Ewa!

30:29.519 --> 30:31.440
I'll follow you.

30:34.799 --> 30:38.319
It's an absolute disgrace
to this newspaper. And to you.

30:38.640 --> 30:42.160
I should've fired Andrzej and all of you
a fucking year ago!

30:42.839 --> 30:45.240
- Excuse me...
- No time for excuses!

30:45.759 --> 30:48.359
- Your accusations are unjustified.
- You bloody joking?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.599
I'm just doing my job!

30:50.960 --> 30:53.160
My source seemed reliable.

30:53.480 --> 30:55.799
- Give me some time.
- For what?

30:56.160 --> 30:58.079
I have to trace him.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.519
- You're not in touch with him?
- I am.

31:00.839 --> 31:02.759
Don't sit here. Go and find him!

31:03.079 --> 31:05.480
Monika, I want to talk to you
in private.

31:05.559 --> 31:07.480
Jurek. Be quiet, OK?

31:24.839 --> 31:26.440
Hello?

31:36.319 --> 31:37.920
Hello?

32:08.519 --> 32:10.839
Hi, Andrzej? We have to meet.

32:50.880 --> 32:54.200
Your son went missing
on the train from Kraków to Warsaw.

32:54.519 --> 32:56.920
Why didn't you report that?

32:58.079 --> 33:00.599
It hasn't been twenty-four hours.

33:02.599 --> 33:04.920
Where were you last night?

33:05.240 --> 33:07.559
I was looking for my son.

33:08.559 --> 33:12.279
Together with the suspect
in the death of Grzegorz Merta.

33:12.599 --> 33:14.839
I know nothing about it.

33:16.519 --> 33:20.440
Just like you know nothing
about the death of Adrian Bogusz.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.839
How is it related to my missing son?

33:24.160 --> 33:26.640
Let's stop this childish conversation.

33:26.720 --> 33:29.039
I'll speak in the presence of my lawyer.

33:29.359 --> 33:32.079
You'd like to find your son,
wouldn't you?

33:33.000 --> 33:36.920
Then I think you should start
collaborating with us.

33:38.519 --> 33:40.240
How?

33:40.599 --> 33:44.119
You may persuade Mr Grodecki
to, let's say, cooperate.

33:45.480 --> 33:49.799
And we'll start looking for your son
in double-quick time.

33:54.680 --> 33:57.599
Kidnappers are rather impatient people.

33:57.920 --> 34:00.160
But we have access to everything.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.799
Including the staff of the train
your son took.

34:03.119 --> 34:07.839
I don't get it: are you concerned
for the safety of my son or Mr Grodecki?

34:26.239 --> 34:28.480
What did you tell them?

34:57.960 --> 35:00.599
- What's up?
- The reflection of the cameraman.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.639
We've got him.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.079
And who is it?

35:13.639 --> 35:15.360
Weronika?

35:32.840 --> 35:34.760
Nawrot. He's here.

35:35.480 --> 35:38.119
Calm down. You said you had security.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.039
What's going on? Are you there? Hello?

35:45.280 --> 35:48.199
- They're coming after me.
- Run, you hear me?!

35:51.440 --> 35:53.559
Hello? Piotr?

35:54.599 --> 35:56.920
What's going on? You hear me?

35:58.480 --> 36:00.000
Hello?

37:21.679 --> 37:23.800
Piotr, what's going on?

37:26.519 --> 37:28.440
What? How?

37:32.760 --> 37:34.800
Yes, take care of her.

37:35.119 --> 37:38.639
Let's meet at the railway station.
They can be tracking us down.

37:39.519 --> 37:41.039
All right.

37:41.679 --> 37:43.199
Bye.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.320
Operating theatre, now.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.400
Please wait here. You can't come inside.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.000
New message from Weronika

39:25.320 --> 39:27.840
They're following me.
Meet me in Grzybowski Square.

40:07.159 --> 40:08.880
Go on.

40:09.199 --> 40:11.119
That manager...

40:11.440 --> 40:15.360
I met him at the hotel on Tuesday.
Next day, we went to the bank.

40:15.679 --> 40:19.119
He took the audio out of a deposit box
and gave it to me.

40:19.639 --> 40:22.679
I never saw him again.
And now this Nawrot's show...

40:23.000 --> 40:25.320
What's this all about?

40:27.239 --> 40:29.559
When did you get the photos?

40:29.920 --> 40:32.639
They were on my desk on Monday morning.

40:32.960 --> 40:35.280
- Kowalik?
- I don't know.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.880
- We need to check out that manager.
- How?

40:41.199 --> 40:43.719
Go to his employer and ask him out.

40:44.039 --> 40:47.360
It worked once,
it's going to work this time.

40:47.719 --> 40:49.440
And you?

40:50.679 --> 40:53.400
I'll meet Nawrot.

42:28.719 --> 42:31.159
Haven't you had enough?

42:41.400 --> 42:43.320
Hold on...

42:45.280 --> 42:47.000
Hold on...

43:54.360 --> 43:56.800
cast

44:04.559 --> 44:07.280
