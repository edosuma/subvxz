01:05.625 --> 01:08.125
<i>as the green it produces.</i>

01:08.458 --> 01:13.750
Last quarter, our green dropped a leaf.

01:13.834 --> 01:16.125
I trust that won't happen again.

01:16.208 --> 01:20.166
Wilbury, give us an update
on the top-secret project

01:20.250 --> 01:23.166
that will put us back in full bloom.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.500
[Wilbury gulps] I seem to have left it
back in my office.

01:27.583 --> 01:29.709
If you'll wait, I'll be right back.

01:29.792 --> 01:31.792
I don't like waiting.

01:33.291 --> 01:37.333
Sir, I just happen to have
a back up of the report with me.

01:37.417 --> 01:41.583
Very good, Perry.
Continue where Wilbury left off.

01:41.667 --> 01:46.291
As you see, Khan Industries
will set record profits this quarter,

01:46.375 --> 01:49.542
due chiefly to the top-secret
flying project.

01:49.625 --> 01:51.917
Which, once in mass production,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.208
will definitely give us the edge

01:54.291 --> 01:57.333
<i>over our rival,</i>
<i>the Miniversal Corporation.</i>

01:57.417 --> 02:00.083
And here's something else I invented.
Very exciting.

02:00.166 --> 02:04.333
Wow. Great, Buzz.
This is the best one I've ever seen.

02:04.417 --> 02:06.000
Uh, what is it?

02:06.083 --> 02:09.959
The world's tiniest superpowered
electro pocket fan.

02:10.041 --> 02:13.792
[chuckles] It doesn't look big enough
to cool off a flea circus.

02:13.875 --> 02:16.792
[chuckles] Oh, yeah? Watch this.

02:18.417 --> 02:21.041
[screams]

02:21.125 --> 02:22.750
Hold on, Little Britches.

02:22.834 --> 02:25.000
Must be an off button around somewhere.

02:25.083 --> 02:27.792
An off button...
why didn't I think of that?

02:28.166 --> 02:29.208
[groans]

02:30.041 --> 02:31.834
[screams]

02:32.208 --> 02:33.125
[thud]

02:33.333 --> 02:35.375
Well, blow me down.

02:35.709 --> 02:37.875
You should see it when I set it on high.

02:37.959 --> 02:39.458
You can have it if you want.

02:39.542 --> 02:42.959
Thanks, Buzz. I don't know how I could've
lived without one.

02:43.041 --> 02:45.041
Hey, what are friends for?

02:45.125 --> 02:47.458
Um, what's this thing do?

02:47.542 --> 02:50.625
It's my automatic garbage can,
but it's not quite--

02:50.709 --> 02:51.500
Help!

02:51.583 --> 02:52.458
[Buzz] ...perfected.

02:52.542 --> 02:54.834
[Kit] Get me outta here!

02:58.583 --> 03:01.500
You're just full of great ideas, Buzz.

03:01.583 --> 03:03.709
Thanks. When I'm not
inventing for Mr. Khan

03:03.792 --> 03:05.458
I'm just overflowing with stuff.

03:05.542 --> 03:08.375
Wait! Another brilliant idea!

03:08.458 --> 03:10.583
An electric toaster.

03:10.667 --> 03:13.583
Uh, I think that's already been invented.

03:13.667 --> 03:15.667
Oh, fiddlesticks.

03:17.333 --> 03:20.417
-What's in here?
-Oh, no! That's top secret.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.250
Top secret, huh?

03:22.333 --> 03:24.750
Come on. You can tell ol' Baloo.

03:24.834 --> 03:26.959
No, no. Can't tell.

03:27.041 --> 03:29.083
Swore on my Bunsen burner.

03:29.166 --> 03:30.750
Then let me guess.

03:30.834 --> 03:33.166
How 'bout a flying pig?

03:33.250 --> 03:35.458
I always wanted to see one of those.

03:37.750 --> 03:42.917
No. All I can say is it's my
most brilliant invention yet.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.667
Even more brilliant than my electric
tongue shaver and lip polisher.

03:49.667 --> 03:52.291
[Kit] That Buzz is a crazy old coot,

03:52.375 --> 03:53.959
but it was fun visiting him.

03:54.041 --> 03:57.250
Yeah, he is kinda eccentric, isn't he?

03:57.333 --> 03:59.125
But I've known him all my life.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.625
He even gave me one of these.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.875
Whatever it is.

04:02.959 --> 04:05.792
Well, let's wind 'er up and see.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.000
Look out! [screams]

04:12.083 --> 04:13.291
Incoming!

04:13.375 --> 04:15.166
[whooshing noise]

04:39.500 --> 04:42.875
[chuckles]
I must've overwound it a tad.

04:42.959 --> 04:45.417
Is it safe to come out, Papa Bear?

04:45.500 --> 04:48.166
[chuckles]

04:48.250 --> 04:50.083
[muffled] Yeah, it's safe.

04:51.333 --> 04:55.333
Oh, now where's some
uranium-238 when you need it?

04:55.417 --> 04:57.333
[Perry] Yeah, I've got the million bucks.

04:57.417 --> 04:59.792
No, no. Khan doesn't suspect a thing.

04:59.875 --> 05:03.083
By this afternoon, Miniversal will have
in their possession

05:03.166 --> 05:05.667
One top-secret project.

05:05.750 --> 05:10.500
Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, this is bad.
Very bad.

05:10.583 --> 05:14.917
A thief. [mumbles]
Must inform someone.

05:16.041 --> 05:18.458
It seems a slight problem has developed.

05:21.041 --> 05:23.291
Security, this is Mr. Perry.

05:23.375 --> 05:25.959
We have a spy in our midst.

05:26.041 --> 05:30.542
[Khan] <i>I'll be tending my jungle</i>
<i>for the rest of the day, Mrs. Snarly.</i>

05:30.625 --> 05:33.417
<i>I do not wish to be disturbed for anything</i>

05:33.500 --> 05:35.792
<i>less than a million dollars.</i>

05:35.875 --> 05:39.500
Yes, Mr. Khan, but remember
you have that four o'clock meeting.

05:40.458 --> 05:42.917
[mumbles] This is serious. Help!

05:43.000 --> 05:45.667
May I suggest decaf, Buzz.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.834
Must see Mr. Khan!

05:47.917 --> 05:52.375
Sorry, sweetie. Khan gave orders
not to be disturbed.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.959
But this can't wait. No time to lose.

05:55.083 --> 05:57.500
[guard] There he is!
Buzz, you're coming with us.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.750
No! I didn't do anything wrong,

05:59.834 --> 06:01.375
I'm a loyal employee.

06:01.458 --> 06:03.875
I'm even captain
of the company chess team.

06:03.959 --> 06:07.125
Hey! What the--

06:07.208 --> 06:08.250
Stop him!

06:08.417 --> 06:09.250
[alarm wails]

06:09.333 --> 06:11.208
[guard] Halt! Or we'll shoot!

06:11.291 --> 06:14.917
[alarm ringing]

06:23.959 --> 06:26.750
Open up, Buzz! There's no way out.

06:26.834 --> 06:28.458
[helicopter whirring]

06:28.583 --> 06:29.667
[crashing]

06:32.834 --> 06:33.709
What the...

06:35.083 --> 06:37.458
Mr. Khan, I'm afraid
I have disturbing news.

06:37.542 --> 06:40.542
<i>Your top-secret project...</i>
<i>It's been stolen.</i>

06:40.625 --> 06:43.625
Do we know by whom, Mr. Perry?

06:43.709 --> 06:46.000
Yes, sir. It's Buzz.

06:46.083 --> 06:48.542
I've suspected the old guy for some time.

06:48.625 --> 06:51.166
Post a reward for his capture

06:51.250 --> 06:53.542
and the return of my project.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.375
And don't disappoint me.

06:58.709 --> 06:59.542
Hmm.

06:59.667 --> 07:04.041
A motorized toothbrush.
What'll Buzz think of next?

07:08.667 --> 07:10.333
Baloo... Baloo!

07:13.333 --> 07:17.250
Thanks, Kit. I was just
cleaning the old ivories.

07:18.083 --> 07:19.583
What's left of them.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.333
Buzz is big trouble!

07:21.417 --> 07:24.000
They say he stole Khan's secret project.

07:24.083 --> 07:27.750
Oh, come on.
I know Buzz. He's no crook.

07:27.834 --> 07:29.792
Then you're the only one who believes it.

07:29.875 --> 07:31.458
What are we gonna do?

07:31.542 --> 07:33.709
Well, first we'll have to find him.

07:33.792 --> 07:37.333
And I have a pretty good
idea where to look.

07:38.208 --> 07:42.375
His favorite thinking spot
in the No-Smokey Mountains.

07:50.709 --> 07:53.583
[Baloo] Buzz! Buzz!

07:53.667 --> 07:56.291
If you can hear me, yell once.

07:56.375 --> 07:59.166
If you can't, yell twice.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.542
You sure we have the right place?

08:02.625 --> 08:03.500
Hey!

08:04.333 --> 08:05.291
Oh!

08:06.208 --> 08:08.875
Yeah, I'd say we're on the right track.

08:08.959 --> 08:11.375
You all right, Papa Bear? Ah!

08:11.458 --> 08:14.041
Don't move, Little Britches.
I'll give you a hand.

08:14.125 --> 08:15.291
Uh-oh.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.959
[Baloo straining]

08:20.500 --> 08:22.041
Close shave.

08:22.125 --> 08:25.208
We'll have to keep a lookout
for more booby traps.

08:25.291 --> 08:27.166
Maybe we should go home.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.166
Nah. We'll be okay.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.166
Now that we know what to look for.

08:32.125 --> 08:33.041
[groans]

08:36.457 --> 08:40.500
[screams]

08:42.250 --> 08:45.542
[screams]

08:55.709 --> 09:00.625
[Buzz straining] Baloo, Kit,
nice of you to drop in.

09:00.709 --> 09:03.959
I didn't realize it was you guys up there.

09:04.041 --> 09:06.083
I would've disarmed the traps.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.458
Gee, thanks.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.125
Papa Bear, look.

09:09.208 --> 09:13.083
Oh, that's the top-secret
project I didn't tell you about.

09:13.166 --> 09:16.417
Wow! That's something.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.000
Yes, but what I don't know.

09:19.083 --> 09:21.375
I'm either gonna call it a helicopter

09:21.458 --> 09:24.166
or a cuisenart.

09:24.250 --> 09:28.500
Strange names. Uh, looks more like
an oversized eggbeater to me.

09:28.583 --> 09:31.250
Oh, no, no, it's a flying machine.

09:31.333 --> 09:33.959
Flying machine? Oh, go on.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.250
Where are the wings?

09:35.333 --> 09:36.625
It doesn't need wings.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.750
Goes round and round
and round and round and round.

09:38.834 --> 09:41.583
Nevermind, Buzz. You're in big trouble.

09:41.667 --> 09:44.333
Khan's people think you
stole this dohickey.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.625
Oh, no, no. I took it for safekeeping

09:46.709 --> 09:48.959
so someone else wouldn't take it.

09:49.041 --> 09:51.375
Glow-in-the-dark furniture!

09:51.458 --> 09:54.792
Yes, save on light bulbs.
I've done it again.

09:54.875 --> 09:56.542
Oh, look, I got an idea.

09:56.667 --> 09:59.458
I'll go and find Khan
and explain everything to him.

09:59.542 --> 10:01.166
Now how does that sound?

10:01.250 --> 10:03.375
Buzz? Buzz?

10:03.458 --> 10:05.875
Kit, take care of him until I get back.

10:05.959 --> 10:07.208
Aye, aye, Baloo.

10:12.458 --> 10:15.208
I need to see Mr. Khan. Pronto.

10:15.291 --> 10:16.792
Sure thing, sweetie.

10:16.875 --> 10:19.709
I can squeeze you in a week from Thursday.

10:19.792 --> 10:23.208
But it's an emergency.
A matter of life and death.

10:23.291 --> 10:25.959
In that case, a week from Wednesday.

10:26.041 --> 10:27.500
I'm such a softie.

10:28.792 --> 10:31.667
Can't wait that long, lady.
I have to see him now.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.417
[clears throat]
Don't mind me. I'm Khanie's fiancée.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.166
I'm just on my way to see Poopsie.

10:59.500 --> 11:03.041
I seem to have a run in my stocking.

11:09.750 --> 11:13.208
[Baloo] Special delivery for Mr. Khan.

11:13.291 --> 11:17.375
Must be the giant pincushion he ordered.

11:17.458 --> 11:20.125
Let's see if it works.

11:20.208 --> 11:21.417
[Baloo] Uh-oh.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.750
[screams]

11:36.500 --> 11:38.083
Ah!

11:38.917 --> 11:41.417
[Baloo] But you've got to
let me see Mr. Khan. Buzz is innocent.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.458
He only took the secret project
so it wouldn't be stolen.

11:44.542 --> 11:47.917
You know where Buzz
and the secret project are?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.667
Yeah. That's what
I've been trying to tell Khan.

11:50.750 --> 11:51.959
Ouch!

11:52.041 --> 11:54.041
Should I call security, Mr. Perry?

11:54.125 --> 11:56.250
No, no. It's all right, Mrs. Snarly.

11:56.333 --> 11:57.375
I'll handle it.

11:57.458 --> 11:58.333
Ow!

12:00.959 --> 12:04.125
So, Buzz is a friend of yours?

12:04.208 --> 12:06.750
He's a friend of mine too.

12:06.834 --> 12:07.667
Really?

12:07.750 --> 12:11.125
Of course, and I'd like to help him.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.208
What are friends for?

12:13.291 --> 12:15.750
Say, why don't you take me to see Buzz

12:15.834 --> 12:18.750
and I'll straighten out
this whole misunderstanding?

12:18.834 --> 12:21.792
Sure thing. I'll fly you there right away.

12:21.875 --> 12:25.291
No, no. We'll take my plane.
I can write off the mileage.

12:27.458 --> 12:30.000
[Baloo] I'm sure lucky I ran into you.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.208
For a moment, I thought Buzz
was gonna be in big trouble.

12:34.083 --> 12:37.208
The opening's got to be here somewheres.

12:38.166 --> 12:40.709
[all scream]

12:46.375 --> 12:48.625
Buzz! Buzz!

12:48.709 --> 12:51.709
Hello, Baloo. [chuckles]

12:51.792 --> 12:55.041
I thought it looked
familiar from down here.

12:55.125 --> 12:58.166
Buzz, good news. Look who I brought.

12:58.250 --> 13:01.500
Welcome and make yourselves at home.

13:01.583 --> 13:02.917
Seize them!

13:03.000 --> 13:05.834
The top-secret project's mine at last.

13:05.917 --> 13:09.000
Was it something I said?

13:16.375 --> 13:17.375
You know, Baloo,

13:17.500 --> 13:21.125
I think I figured out who it was
who I overheard on the phone.

13:21.208 --> 13:23.667
So, how're we doing?

13:24.875 --> 13:28.417
Fine, except I got this itch. Do you mind?

13:28.500 --> 13:32.709
Quiet! You're the only one
who knows how to fly this contraption.

13:32.792 --> 13:36.709
You're gonna help me
deliver it to Miniversal Corporation.

13:36.792 --> 13:39.041
Never! I'm a loyal company man.

13:39.125 --> 13:41.667
I won't help you even if you torture us.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.625
[speaks indistinctly]

13:43.709 --> 13:45.709
We don't want to give them any ideas.

13:45.792 --> 13:49.375
Quiet! I'd change my mind if I were you.

13:49.458 --> 13:52.041
Khan's gonna blame you for everything.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.542
If you help me,

13:53.625 --> 13:56.417
I may get you a job at Miniversal.

13:57.667 --> 13:59.834
Hey, I didn't say anything.

13:59.917 --> 14:01.333
Yeah? Well, you would've.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.709
Long time no see, Little Britches.

14:06.792 --> 14:09.166
The knots are too tight.

14:09.250 --> 14:13.959
Try my miniature Swiss Army Chainsaw.
In my left pocket.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.208
Time to taxi!

14:23.250 --> 14:25.500
Stop them! I need that inventor.

14:29.125 --> 14:30.500
[groans]

14:45.959 --> 14:47.291
You okay?

14:47.375 --> 14:51.500
Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

14:51.583 --> 14:54.083
Except for this headache.

14:54.166 --> 14:56.333
By the way, who's Buzz?

14:56.417 --> 14:58.625
Uh-oh.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.709
Hmm.
Can someone please turn off the bell?

15:12.792 --> 15:14.709
It's awfully loud in here.

15:14.792 --> 15:17.291
Now remember, you're a guard.

15:17.375 --> 15:20.291
I thought you said I was an inventor.

15:20.375 --> 15:23.375
Sounds like he's still got
a few cobs in his web.

15:28.125 --> 15:30.291
Hold it right there!

15:32.792 --> 15:34.542
Did you find them?

15:34.625 --> 15:36.041
Sure did.

15:45.583 --> 15:47.667
Go ahead, Buzz. Fly us out of here.

15:48.291 --> 15:52.500
Fly? But I'm a security guard.
I wish you'd make up your mind.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.583
Uh-oh. Trouble.

15:55.667 --> 15:57.083
With a capital p.

16:00.083 --> 16:02.542
Move over. I'll fly this blender.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.542
That is if it can fly.

16:10.291 --> 16:13.500
They've got the secret project! Stop them!

16:15.166 --> 16:17.083
Better make like a birdy, Baloo!

16:39.291 --> 16:42.000
Must be that low-octane fuel.

16:43.417 --> 16:45.041
Shoot it down!

16:45.792 --> 16:46.792
No!

16:49.959 --> 16:50.875
[screams]

16:56.917 --> 17:00.166
You know, I think I'm beginning
to get the hang of it.

17:00.250 --> 17:02.792
Next stop, Khan Industries.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.750
[Perry] <i>I've spotted the thieves.</i>

17:12.834 --> 17:16.000
<i>They're armed and dangerous</i>
<i>and heading back to Cape Suzette,</i>

17:16.083 --> 17:18.709
Blow them out of the sky.

17:24.416 --> 17:26.000
How're you feeling, Buzz?

17:26.083 --> 17:28.040
Much better. Even the ringing has stopped.

17:28.125 --> 17:32.041
Ringing! Clothes that ring
when they need washing.

17:32.125 --> 17:33.750
What a brilliant idea.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.333
He's better, all right.

17:35.417 --> 17:37.166
Here, you take the wheel.

17:37.250 --> 17:39.000
No time, Papa Bear. Company.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.125
Hey, it's only Khan's men.

17:46.208 --> 17:49.041
Hi, this is Baloo

17:49.125 --> 17:53.125
<i>and I've got something that</i>
<i>I'm returning to your boss.</i>

17:55.875 --> 17:57.625
Must not like working overtime.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.709
Hold on. It's gonna get bumpy.

18:04.667 --> 18:09.000
Hey, this baby can really move, Buzz.

18:17.458 --> 18:19.500
[machine-gun fire]

18:38.291 --> 18:42.333
Oh, ho. Definitely gonna have to
get me one of these things for Christmas.

18:42.959 --> 18:47.166
And I just came by
to tell you how sorry I am

18:47.250 --> 18:49.709
you've lost your secret project.

18:51.500 --> 18:55.083
Funny thing...
I've got a secret project of my own

18:55.166 --> 18:58.083
that should be developed any minute now.

18:58.083 --> 19:00.959
What do you think of those apples, Khan?

19:05.458 --> 19:08.542
Looks like it's time to play
follow the leader.

19:15.166 --> 19:17.917
[Perry] <i>Mr. Baloo, nice to see you again.</i>

19:18.000 --> 19:18.959
Perry?

19:19.041 --> 19:22.333
<i>Take a peek in your side view mirror.</i>

19:22.417 --> 19:23.709
You can run, my friend,

19:23.792 --> 19:26.542
<i>but you can't hide.</i>

19:26.625 --> 19:27.709
Baloo!

19:27.792 --> 19:31.542
I think it's time we found out
what this puppy can really do.

19:33.375 --> 19:35.250
[groans]

19:36.959 --> 19:38.417
Uh-oh.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.458
Mr. Khan, there's someone
that keeps calling

19:49.542 --> 19:51.542
insisting that he has to see you.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.709
[Khan] Tell him I'm busy.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.959
Can't you see I'm with Mr. Salton,

19:56.041 --> 19:57.542
head of Miniversal?

19:59.875 --> 20:01.125
[helicopter blades whirring]

20:10.792 --> 20:13.625
Maybe you'd like to tell him yourself.

20:13.709 --> 20:15.583
Hey, how's it going, Khanie?

20:15.667 --> 20:17.750
I believe this belongs to you.

20:17.834 --> 20:20.417
My secret project.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.625
I had to take it, Mr. Khan,

20:22.709 --> 20:24.875
to stop Mr. Perry from stealing it

20:24.959 --> 20:26.709
and selling it to Miniversal.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.959
Miniversal?

20:32.500 --> 20:34.333
Mr. Khan, I've done it.

20:34.417 --> 20:36.083
At risk to life and limb,

20:36.166 --> 20:38.417
I got your secret project back.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.083
What kind of double-cross is this?

20:41.166 --> 20:43.667
I paid you a million dollars for it!

20:44.625 --> 20:47.000
Mr. Salton?

20:47.083 --> 20:50.000
Well, well, well.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.917
Well, Buzz,
Khan's giving you your job back

20:55.000 --> 20:57.458
and everything's on the up and up again.

20:57.542 --> 21:00.792
Thanks to you, Baloo,
and everything you did.

21:00.875 --> 21:03.041
Hey, it's was nothing.

21:03.125 --> 21:04.166
You're my--

21:04.250 --> 21:06.125
Inflatable shoes!

21:06.208 --> 21:07.834
That can walk on water...

21:07.917 --> 21:10.166
...buddy, when you're here.

21:10.291 --> 21:12.000
[Khan] Ahem.

21:12.750 --> 21:16.875
You did Khan Industries
a great service, Mr. Baloo.

21:16.959 --> 21:19.875
A token of my appreciation.

21:22.792 --> 21:24.583
Hey, thanks, Khanie.

21:24.667 --> 21:26.125
Catch you on easy street.

21:26.208 --> 21:29.375
[chuckles] Will you look at this, Kit?

21:30.875 --> 21:35.208
Mrs. Snarly, the gentleman on his way out.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.083
[Mrs. Snarly] One moment, Mr. Baloo...

21:39.166 --> 21:41.250
I believe there's a matter of expenses.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.125
Expenses?

21:43.208 --> 21:45.709
[Mrs. Snarly] For example,
the broken window...

21:45.792 --> 21:48.542
The damage to Mr. Khan's office...

21:48.625 --> 21:51.917
Repairs to the top-secret project...

21:52.000 --> 21:55.208
And, of course, parking a cuisenart

21:55.291 --> 21:57.792
in a no cuisenart zone.

21:58.875 --> 22:01.375
There, that should do it.

22:01.458 --> 22:03.041
Have a nice day.
