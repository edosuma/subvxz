00:01.070 --> 00:02.441
<i>Previously on Medium.</i>

00:02.657 --> 00:04.085
Why'd I dream that dream?

00:04.667 --> 00:05.859
I was at school,

00:06.041 --> 00:09.187
and OwenÂ´s mother was standing
just past the fence, waving to him.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.159
She poured gasoline
all over herserlf and lit a match.

00:12.329 --> 00:15.230
This Stacey case. This thing where
this

00:15.609 --> 00:17.464
man sets his wife on fire.

00:17.634 --> 00:20.366
And are you aware that
our old friend Manuel Devalos is

00:20.544 --> 00:22.996
representing the number
one suspect in this case?

00:23.168 --> 00:24.380
Yeah, I knew that, why?

00:24.560 --> 00:26.690
Because I'm not about to let the man
I replaced

00:26.872 --> 00:28.589
get the best of me in this matter.

00:28.769 --> 00:31.538
What would you say if I told you
that we obtained a warrant

00:31.709 --> 00:34.853
to retrieve the clothing that you sent
down to the hotel laundry that night?

00:35.036 --> 00:36.323
On what grounds?

00:36.506 --> 00:39.292
What if I told you that we found
traces of an accelerant one that matched

00:39.478 --> 00:41.560
the kind that was
used to start the fire?

00:41.736 --> 00:44.661
I'd say I believe that.
Like I said, we were in the garage,

00:44.868 --> 00:47.032
it got heated, she started
throwing things at me.

00:47.206 --> 00:50.422
There was a glass jar, it smashed.
I thought it was turpentine.

00:50.605 --> 00:53.111
I was wondering wheter you could
have a look at these.

00:53.308 --> 00:56.622
You see this missing girl?
I think I just had a dream about her.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.870
She was working as a prostitute.

00:59.065 --> 01:01.411
A dentist picked her up,
took her to his office.

01:01.607 --> 01:04.131
You're telling me this man
you keep dreaming about,

01:04.328 --> 01:07.090
drugged her, and then, when she was
unconscious,

01:07.277 --> 01:09.130
performed dental work on her?

01:09.678 --> 01:11.763
You know you're welcome
to visit us anytime you want.

01:12.095 --> 01:12.931
This week?

01:14.668 --> 01:15.481
Sure.

01:16.275 --> 01:17.032
What?

01:17.286 --> 01:19.412
She's bringing the money
that I asked to borrow.

01:19.806 --> 01:21.840
Can I take you into my confidence?

01:22.266 --> 01:24.592
Joe can't know what
I'm about to tell you.

01:28.077 --> 01:29.740
I'm pretty sick, Allison.

01:29.945 --> 01:33.642
It's not hopeless, there's treatment,
an operation.

01:34.478 --> 01:37.890
I'm flying to Minneapolis when
I leave here, to the Mayo Clinic.

01:38.836 --> 01:40.463
My odds are 60%.

01:40.638 --> 01:42.460
When I heard that number
I thought of you.

01:43.525 --> 01:45.533
If I go into the hospital knowing,

01:45.845 --> 01:47.960
that I might not come out, then,

01:48.665 --> 01:51.123
obviously I'd do
some things differently.

01:51.627 --> 01:54.612
I wish so badly
I had something to tell you.

01:56.757 --> 01:57.921
Not a word to Joe.

01:58.956 --> 02:00.232
Not a word to Joe.

02:13.296 --> 02:13.980
So?

02:14.445 --> 02:15.461
So what?

02:17.708 --> 02:18.952
How'd it go?

02:23.185 --> 02:25.471
It was a regular love fest.

02:25.678 --> 02:26.972
A love fest?

02:28.118 --> 02:29.392
I like that.

02:34.566 --> 02:35.712
I love you.

02:36.426 --> 02:37.322
Love you.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.112
Took a lot of work,

02:49.287 --> 02:51.342
to get you up to speed, young lady.

02:53.208 --> 02:54.052
Plaque,

02:54.557 --> 02:55.582
tartar,

02:56.967 --> 02:58.431
gingivitis.

02:58.605 --> 03:00.663
You really,

03:01.886 --> 03:03.881
put me through my paces.

03:04.747 --> 03:06.002
Good news is,

03:06.428 --> 03:09.083
now your mouth
is ready for anything.

03:25.385 --> 03:26.793
You starting to feel something?

03:32.668 --> 03:33.812
My apologies.

04:26.608 --> 04:27.653
He punched her?

04:27.836 --> 04:29.380
Right in the face, in the mouth,

04:29.556 --> 04:32.412
the very same mouth he spent
the whole night slaving over.

04:33.218 --> 04:34.592
That makes no sense.

04:35.378 --> 04:36.441
Thank you.

04:36.637 --> 04:38.001
You're welcome. For what?

04:38.276 --> 04:39.720
For not biting my head off.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.181
It's so much nicer hearing
that my dreams make no sense

04:42.377 --> 04:44.400
from you than from Cynthia Keener.

04:45.028 --> 04:48.220
You should have heard her,
jumped out my throat yesterday morning.

04:48.628 --> 04:51.521
- I don't like that woman.
- I'm not crazy about her either.

04:51.707 --> 04:53.483
But I kind of understand.

04:54.025 --> 04:56.873
You'd think after 3 dreams
I'd have one genuine clue,

04:57.055 --> 04:58.491
that would make her job easier.

04:58.688 --> 05:00.383
Or the name of the dentist,

05:00.675 --> 05:03.042
the location of his office, something.

05:03.677 --> 05:05.962
Thank god I'm still working for Devalos.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.402
There she is.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.543
I slept like a lamb

05:15.066 --> 05:16.713
How did you sleep, dear?

05:18.216 --> 05:21.250
Anything to tell me?
Any interesting dreams last night?

05:22.506 --> 05:23.972
Not the one I wanted,

05:24.797 --> 05:26.433
not the one I was hoping for.

05:28.925 --> 05:30.012
I'm sorry.

05:30.867 --> 05:32.040
Maybe tonight.

05:38.488 --> 05:40.102
Is it what I think it is?

05:41.236 --> 05:42.523
What the hell took so long?

05:42.707 --> 05:45.110
What can I tell you?
We're a little backed up.

05:45.307 --> 05:47.831
There was a bug going around,
lot of people out.

05:48.157 --> 05:51.030
But I guess you didn't hear anything
about that, right?

05:51.217 --> 05:52.192
Detective.

06:02.977 --> 06:03.901
Dammit.

06:04.645 --> 06:07.363
Cynthia, listen to me,
he was doing things to her.

06:07.787 --> 06:09.323
Some kind of dentistry.

06:09.968 --> 06:11.490
He punched her in the face.

06:11.747 --> 06:14.783
<i>I still have men in field, gathering
information on all the male dentists</i>

06:14.978 --> 06:16.462
<i>located downtown Phoenix.</i>

06:16.828 --> 06:18.582
The second that data is complete,

06:18.766 --> 06:22.483
- <i>I'll call you. We can sit down...</i>
- Fine, I have to go.

06:24.988 --> 06:26.151
How strange is this?

06:27.575 --> 06:28.660
Very strange.

06:29.535 --> 06:31.623
I feel like a guest in my own home?

06:32.386 --> 06:33.522
Have you seen our guy?

06:34.256 --> 06:35.132
Not yet.

06:38.786 --> 06:39.602
Graham.

06:40.047 --> 06:43.163
- Any idea why we've been summoned here?
- Not ????

06:43.575 --> 06:44.773
Look at that.

06:45.785 --> 06:48.071
All my favourite people in one place.

06:50.776 --> 06:52.040
You're looking...

06:52.218 --> 06:53.240
well-rested.

07:01.957 --> 07:04.291
Shall we adjourn
to the conference room?

07:09.887 --> 07:13.601
You may not believe this,
but I've actually found myself drawn

07:13.787 --> 07:14.801
in a very,

07:15.465 --> 07:17.673
personal way, to this case.

07:18.225 --> 07:19.602
We appreciate that.

07:19.795 --> 07:21.972
I know it gets my client
an enormous comfort to know that

07:22.146 --> 07:24.251
District Attorney's
office is as consumed with

07:24.427 --> 07:27.453
finding the perpetrator
of this horrible crime as we are.

07:33.776 --> 07:35.313
Mr. Stacey, are you all right?

07:37.097 --> 07:38.492
Why is that here?

07:40.757 --> 07:44.550
The picture of Mary. Why is there
a picture of my dead wife in here?

07:44.976 --> 07:45.731
Why?

07:47.078 --> 07:49.712
I think it's important for us
to stay focused.

07:51.607 --> 07:54.241
Your wife is what's brougth us
to this room today.

07:55.258 --> 07:56.593
Her heinous murder.

07:57.547 --> 08:01.293
The extraordinarily cruel circumstances
under which she lost her life.

08:01.908 --> 08:05.312
And until the person who is
responsible for that is behind bars,

08:05.576 --> 08:07.051
I want that picture there,

08:07.447 --> 08:08.761
to keep me honest,

08:10.886 --> 08:12.242
to keep me focused.

08:12.447 --> 08:15.643
I'm not sure you understand,
Just what is it we're all doing here?

08:16.078 --> 08:17.691
Isn't it obvious, Manuel?

08:18.438 --> 08:22.513
We're here to arrest your client
for the murder of his wife, Mary Stacey.

08:23.438 --> 08:24.853
- What?
- What grounds?

08:25.028 --> 08:26.500
What grounds would you like?

08:26.720 --> 08:29.020
We have your client at the scene,

08:29.292 --> 08:32.869
we have traces of the accelerant
used in the fire on his clothing

08:33.039 --> 08:34.828
and now we have motive.

08:34.999 --> 08:36.010
What motive?

08:38.955 --> 08:40.202
Send him in, please.

08:47.857 --> 08:50.411
Detective Scanlon, would you be so kind
as to share with our guests

08:50.608 --> 08:52.302
the discovery you made this morning?

09:00.137 --> 09:02.073
Less than a year ago Mr.
Stacey took out a

09:02.245 --> 09:05.443
seven million dollar life
insurance policy on Mrs Stacey.

09:07.366 --> 09:08.812
Is this true, Graham?

09:09.306 --> 09:11.993
The life insurance policy
was my wife's idea.

09:12.167 --> 09:14.540
She wanted me to buy it,
I was just trying to make her happy.

09:14.876 --> 09:17.462
- Why don't you read him his rights.
- Wait a second.

09:18.786 --> 09:20.833
I don't even want the money.
I never wanted it.

09:21.026 --> 09:22.870
The charity can have it all
for all I care.

09:23.077 --> 09:24.150
What charity?

09:24.346 --> 09:27.043
My wife's charity, she's got this thing,
the Dearbrook foundation.

09:27.605 --> 09:29.791
They do medical care
for poor people.

09:30.587 --> 09:33.561
Let's give it to them, they would have
got it all anyway.

09:33.798 --> 09:37.091
- If we had died together...
- But you didn't die together,

09:37.795 --> 09:39.413
because I believed you killed her.

09:40.776 --> 09:41.883
Read him his rights.

09:42.058 --> 09:43.842
You have the right to remain silent.

09:44.036 --> 09:46.262
Anything you say can and will be used
against you...

09:46.448 --> 09:48.632
You can't let them,
there's gotta be a way to stop this.

09:48.816 --> 09:52.140
I understand how you feel, but if you could
just hold down until the bail hearing

09:52.335 --> 09:55.583
I think I can convince the
judge that you're not a flight risk.

09:55.767 --> 09:56.701
You think?

09:56.967 --> 10:00.040
You were the District Attorney,
that's the whole reason I hired you.

10:08.256 --> 10:11.281
Hope you're not serious about
this bail hearing bussiness.

10:11.958 --> 10:16.640
Trust me, as acting District Attorney,
that man is not gonna say daylight.

10:17.815 --> 10:20.002
I don't care how much bail you pledge.

10:20.508 --> 10:22.072
Take your hand off my shoulder.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.522
Just trying to spare you
the humilliation.

10:32.986 --> 10:33.913
Although,

10:34.578 --> 10:36.780
I do think it would be
awfully entertaining.

10:56.428 --> 10:57.770
It's my locker.

10:58.347 --> 11:00.141
I know. Need to get in it?

11:01.206 --> 11:02.403
Not really.

11:03.587 --> 11:04.991
You're Owen, right?

11:08.248 --> 11:09.992
I'm really sorry about your mother.

11:12.468 --> 11:13.750
You got my things.

11:14.417 --> 11:15.702
You touched my things.

11:16.147 --> 11:18.032
The principal asked me to.

11:19.055 --> 11:20.643
I know about your mother.

11:21.537 --> 11:23.323
I've heard stories about you.

11:24.707 --> 11:25.960
Did you see anyting?

11:26.747 --> 11:28.023
What do you mean?

11:28.315 --> 11:30.043
When you touched my things.

11:31.038 --> 11:33.311
There was a postcard
in there from her.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.521
I was just hoping that maybe...

11:36.225 --> 11:37.653
I just heard that

11:38.135 --> 11:40.391
when people like you
touch things from

11:40.595 --> 11:41.620
people who have...

11:44.968 --> 11:46.451
I didn't see anything.

11:48.597 --> 11:50.983
Actually, it never happened
to me before.

11:55.877 --> 11:57.080
I love my dad,

11:57.445 --> 11:59.263
but he's a very serious guy.

12:00.798 --> 12:03.073
He and my mom divorced when I was three.

12:04.806 --> 12:05.890
But my mom...

12:07.565 --> 12:08.783
she was crazy.

12:10.627 --> 12:11.710
It was like,

12:11.978 --> 12:13.682
a really cool kind of crazy.

12:15.358 --> 12:17.083
Playing practical jokes and,

12:17.308 --> 12:19.420
throwing parties and going on trips.

12:20.727 --> 12:23.653
When I'd get to be with her,
which wasn't very often,

12:26.108 --> 12:28.242
we always talked about running away.

12:29.007 --> 12:30.883
Maybe moving to Europe.

12:31.535 --> 12:32.633
Barcelona?

12:33.406 --> 12:34.981
Yeah, Barcelona.

12:37.018 --> 12:39.152
It's her favourite place in the world.

12:40.507 --> 12:43.390
She always said that's where
she wanted to be buried.

12:45.178 --> 12:47.330
I don't think that's gonna happen now.

12:51.386 --> 12:53.243
Think I should get to class.

12:53.525 --> 12:54.511
Me too.

13:08.988 --> 13:09.773
Come on.

13:14.326 --> 13:16.383
You work with somebody for years...

13:16.705 --> 13:18.343
What did he say?

13:18.818 --> 13:20.181
I'll tell you what he said.

13:20.356 --> 13:23.652
He said that I probably ought
to wrap my head around the possibility

13:23.836 --> 13:26.693
- that my client is actually guilty.
- But he can't know that.

13:26.865 --> 13:28.301
He sure acts like he knows it.

13:28.485 --> 13:31.361
- Did you mention the suicide thing again?
- I certainly did.

13:31.555 --> 13:34.420
And he thought the medical examiner
is gonna have a tough time with that.

13:34.598 --> 13:36.542
What do you mean, medical examiner?

13:36.715 --> 13:39.390
It turns out that the medical
examiner just completed his examination

13:39.588 --> 13:41.191
on Mrs. Stacey's remains.

13:41.385 --> 13:44.723
Her skull revealed a variety of
bump forced trauma to the face and head.

13:47.996 --> 13:50.822
Could she have maybe fallen,
disoriented herself?

13:50.996 --> 13:53.093
She was struck, multiple times.

13:53.307 --> 13:55.581
And in my experience,
people don't normally strike themselves

13:55.777 --> 13:57.320
prior to commiting suicide.

13:59.528 --> 14:02.743
I've spent the better part of my adult
life sending guilty people to prison.

14:02.935 --> 14:05.680
I know what guilty man look like,
and this guy...

14:07.528 --> 14:08.912
I just don't believe it.

14:10.805 --> 14:12.320
Let's get out of here.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.790
February 9th, 1964.

14:15.736 --> 14:17.890
- I'm lying in the hospital...
- Not this again.

14:18.076 --> 14:22.012
- waiting for this guy to finally arrive.
- She knows that's not my birthday.

14:23.785 --> 14:25.102
And on the television,

14:25.485 --> 14:29.131
The Beatles are making their
1st appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.

14:29.305 --> 14:30.523
This is all a lie.

14:32.685 --> 14:36.460
And they walk out on stage,
the 4 moptops, they called them.

14:36.645 --> 14:39.242
She knows when
my birthday is, she's my wife.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.872
She knows what year I was born.

14:42.047 --> 14:45.522
And all the girls in
the audience start screaming.

14:46.045 --> 14:49.510
And at the same exact moment,
amazingly,

14:49.886 --> 14:51.230
this one arrives.

14:51.438 --> 14:54.511
And so, of course I start
screaming then too.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.392
I don't even think
they had TV back then.

14:56.587 --> 15:00.280
I'm convinced that
something magical happened.

15:00.997 --> 15:06.073
because ever since then, we can't
get this boy to get a proper haircut.

15:06.977 --> 15:08.793
- Moptop.
- Mom, please...

15:08.978 --> 15:10.960
What are we gonna do with you?

15:11.497 --> 15:12.733
Okay, that's it.

15:12.916 --> 15:13.891
That's enough.

15:14.078 --> 15:17.010
I'm not gonna be manhandled
and libeled by my mother.

15:18.187 --> 15:20.341
Not unless there's another check in it.

15:23.085 --> 15:24.273
Gimme a kiss.

15:24.806 --> 15:26.610
I got kids to take
to school in the morning.

15:26.808 --> 15:28.360
I'm just saying...

15:28.537 --> 15:30.773
Bye mom.
Don't keep her up too late.

15:31.547 --> 15:33.371
I heard you, Ringo

15:46.515 --> 15:47.733
I have to tell him.

15:50.156 --> 15:52.881
I have never kept a secret from him,
not ever.

15:53.808 --> 15:54.632
Really?

15:59.557 --> 16:03.023
So you can keep a secret
from me for 15 years,

16:03.597 --> 16:07.123
but you can't keep a secret
from your husband for a week and a half.

16:08.657 --> 16:10.483
I find that hard to believe.

16:15.297 --> 16:16.623
It's time for bed.

16:17.498 --> 16:18.680
Who knows?

16:19.267 --> 16:21.583
Maybe you'll dream me
some good news.

16:25.565 --> 16:28.412
It almost never works
with people I'm close to.

16:29.258 --> 16:32.050
And I've never been able
to make it work on demand.

16:32.628 --> 16:34.652
You know what the doctors tell me?

16:35.316 --> 16:38.203
60% of this battle is being positive,

16:38.547 --> 16:40.023
thinking positively.

16:41.117 --> 16:43.091
So think good thoughts.

16:44.477 --> 16:46.113
Dream good dreams.

16:54.735 --> 16:55.792
I don't understand!

16:55.978 --> 16:58.872
What is there to understand?
I don't want to see you.

16:59.048 --> 17:02.163
I want you out of here,
I want you off my property.

17:02.357 --> 17:03.792
This is still our property.

17:03.975 --> 17:06.021
If you don't want me here
what was that call about?

17:06.208 --> 17:07.380
I don't know, Graham.

17:07.586 --> 17:10.630
I had some wine at dinner,
maybe I drunk too much.

17:11.258 --> 17:12.101
Just...

17:12.567 --> 17:13.603
leave, loser.

17:14.137 --> 17:15.182
I don't get this!

17:15.938 --> 17:18.900
That's the entire reason
this marriage no longer works,

17:19.085 --> 17:22.693
because you don't get anything.
You certainly don't get me.

17:22.885 --> 17:26.143
Which is why, for the rest of all time
you don't get me.

17:26.464 --> 17:28.260
- Get me?!
- Would you keep your voice down?

17:28.648 --> 17:31.503
He don't get it, and now
he ain't never gonna get it!

17:31.686 --> 17:34.952
And even when he could get it,
he didn't know how to give it!

17:38.617 --> 17:39.943
What the hell are you doing?

17:41.418 --> 17:43.250
Are you crazy? That's turpentine!

17:43.448 --> 17:44.302
Get out.

18:06.155 --> 18:07.223
You get him?

18:07.846 --> 18:10.350
Smelled like a paint locker
when he left here.

18:36.485 --> 18:39.163
Coffee. You shouldn't have gone into
all that trouble, what do I owe you?

18:39.346 --> 18:41.150
What are you doin' here?
How'd you get in?

18:41.506 --> 18:43.160
You know how I got in here.

18:43.655 --> 18:45.581
Breaking and entering?
That's illegal.

18:45.766 --> 18:48.342
You're right, when we're done here,

18:48.538 --> 18:49.902
I'll arrest myself.

18:50.977 --> 18:52.690
Get off from beyond my desk.

18:54.407 --> 18:57.371
Absolutely. Listen, Manny,
I don't mean to upset you.

18:58.655 --> 19:00.473
It's this Graham Stacey thing.

19:01.468 --> 19:04.163
I'd like it to work for everyone,
and I think maybe I can make it happen.

19:05.528 --> 19:06.352
Really?

19:06.608 --> 19:07.852
If you wanted to make

19:08.025 --> 19:11.783
some kind of a deal I would be willing
to take it to the District Attorney and,

19:11.978 --> 19:14.233
use every bit of influence that I have.

19:14.436 --> 19:16.340
Really, you? Influence?

19:17.975 --> 19:20.420
And as far as deals are,
no deal is coming, I told you.

19:20.617 --> 19:23.403
- I believe Graham Stacey is innocent.
- Wake up and smell the coffee.

19:23.607 --> 19:26.972
You wake up and smell the coffee. The man
you work for, you want me to make a deal

19:27.156 --> 19:30.092
with my old friend Tom Van Dyke?
He can't be trusted.

19:30.378 --> 19:34.211
- He's a ruthless, arrogant, dangerous man.
- Exactly, that's why I'm here.

19:35.598 --> 19:38.371
He wants to squash you with this case.
it's not enough that he has your job,

19:38.558 --> 19:40.500
he wants to discredit you,
embarrass you.

19:40.695 --> 19:43.113
and he's got at me gathering evidence
to do it, and I'll tell you,

19:43.295 --> 19:45.631
his case against Graham Stacey
isn't getting weaker.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.950
Make the deal, Manny.

19:48.327 --> 19:49.413
Do it now,

19:49.755 --> 19:50.950
and let me out.

19:54.608 --> 19:56.711
You didn't mention that Lee
was gonna be joining us.

19:59.277 --> 20:00.353
I'm not psychic.

20:01.286 --> 20:02.603
You may wanna hear this too.

20:03.847 --> 20:05.080
I had a dream last night.

20:05.255 --> 20:07.951
It was about the night that
Graham Stacey's wife was killed.

20:08.135 --> 20:10.301
I saw them argueing in the garage.

20:10.478 --> 20:12.571
Everything happened the way
that Graham said it did.

20:14.485 --> 20:17.573
Except, after the fight was over
after Graham left,

20:18.148 --> 20:20.070
I saw someone else in the house.

20:20.675 --> 20:21.741
Another man.

20:21.995 --> 20:22.782
A dentist.

20:24.255 --> 20:26.831
I've been dreaming about him lately,
he's a bad man.

20:27.027 --> 20:29.212
I think he may have killed Mary Stacey

20:30.178 --> 20:31.262
Did you say dentist?

20:33.028 --> 20:34.712
Wouldn't be this guy, would he?

20:37.416 --> 20:38.920
As soon as you said dentist,

20:39.258 --> 20:40.560
jogged my memory.

20:41.135 --> 20:44.841
Do you remember when you asked Graham
about the insurance policy on his wife?

20:45.017 --> 20:46.551
That he didn't care about the money,

20:46.735 --> 20:48.923
it could go to his wife's charity,
for all he cared.

20:49.095 --> 20:52.111
- The Dearbrook Foundation.
- This man, this dentist?

20:52.616 --> 20:53.671
Leo Krane.

20:54.106 --> 20:56.060
He's chairman at that foundation.

21:00.168 --> 21:02.733
Oh, my god, I didn't realize
there would be 3 of you.

21:02.925 --> 21:04.403
I'm detective Lee Scanlon.

21:04.586 --> 21:06.661
This is my colleague Allison Dubois

21:07.156 --> 21:08.730
- Manuel Devalos
- Doctor.

21:08.927 --> 21:09.920
He's an attorney,

21:10.116 --> 21:13.481
from one of the principals involved
in the case that we're investigating.

21:14.117 --> 21:15.813
This must be important?

21:17.288 --> 21:20.090
We're investigating the death
of a woman named Mary Stacey.

21:20.266 --> 21:22.650
It's our understanding
that you were acquainted with her.

21:23.308 --> 21:24.600
My god, yes.

21:25.007 --> 21:26.151
Lovely lady.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.381
Lots of fun.

21:28.286 --> 21:32.321
She did work for the Dearbrook Foundation.
That's a charity I'm involved with.

21:33.157 --> 21:36.771
We provide dental and medical care for
marginalized members of the community.

21:38.737 --> 21:40.422
It's horrible what happened to her.

21:40.608 --> 21:41.772
Just horrible.

21:42.547 --> 21:44.431
I heard on the news
you arrested her husband?

21:44.616 --> 21:46.081
They certainly didn't.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.713
I'm actually
representing Mr. Stacey in this matter.

21:52.448 --> 21:55.230
I only met him once, but,
I'd be lying to you if I told you I saw

21:55.406 --> 21:57.480
any incline he was capable
of this sort of thing.

21:57.678 --> 22:01.632
Were you aware there was a $7 million
life insurance policy on Mary Stacey?

22:02.536 --> 22:03.502
No.

22:04.635 --> 22:07.242
I worked with her, but we were
hardly what you would call close

22:07.446 --> 22:10.911
You wouldn't be to share any light on
who the beneficiary might be?

22:12.076 --> 22:13.182
I've no idea.

22:14.626 --> 22:16.033
Her husband, maybe?

22:16.958 --> 22:20.340
But I would think that information
would be pretty easy to get.

22:20.535 --> 22:23.222
- You thinking that's why he killed her?
- Actually, Dr. Krane,

22:23.398 --> 22:27.460
the police are already well aware that
my client is the primary beneficiary.

22:27.898 --> 22:30.390
But the second beneficiary, should,

22:30.858 --> 22:33.772
Mr. Stacey be unable to collect, either

22:33.968 --> 22:36.591
because he perished at
the same time as Mrs. Stacey,

22:36.787 --> 22:37.960
or say because,

22:38.387 --> 22:42.070
he was accused of murder
and faced a life or incarceration,

22:42.898 --> 22:44.460
would be the Dearbrook Foundation.

22:55.738 --> 22:57.971
I swear to you I had no idea.

23:00.078 --> 23:03.570
I sensed Mary got a certain satisfaction
from the work she did with us.

23:03.877 --> 23:05.920
Why would a person do such a thing?

23:07.958 --> 23:12.003
I suppose if they didn't have kids,
and no one to pass the money on to.

23:12.396 --> 23:13.951
Actually, she did have a child.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.383
A son from a previous marriage,
she didn't see him much.

23:16.566 --> 23:18.551
It was an ugly custody situation,
but still...

23:19.127 --> 23:20.921
Did you know,
as chairman of the Foundation,

23:21.107 --> 23:23.670
that you would have sole discretion,
in deciding

23:23.868 --> 23:26.500
how to spend any moneys
that found their way into Dearbrook?

23:26.688 --> 23:27.602
Dr. Krane,

23:28.236 --> 23:31.383
it would really help us if you could
tell us where you were 3 nights ago.

23:31.566 --> 23:33.020
Around 9:30 p.m.

23:35.975 --> 23:38.490
- Should I be calling an attorney?
- I don't know.

23:38.768 --> 23:39.702
Should you be?

23:43.525 --> 23:45.800
I've done a lot of charity work
for this city.

23:45.987 --> 23:48.343
9:30 p.m., Dr. Krane, 3 nights ago.

23:54.045 --> 23:55.752
I'm divorced, 6 years now.

24:00.407 --> 24:02.301
Are you all familiar
with Van Buren street?

24:06.645 --> 24:08.823
I got through my last patient
at around...

24:09.016 --> 24:09.922
8 o'clock.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.910
I closed up the office,
I went up to my car...

24:13.377 --> 24:14.882
I drove by Van Buren.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.430
It's not the 1st time.

24:20.475 --> 24:22.143
There was this girl...

24:24.448 --> 24:25.422
Dark hair,

24:25.725 --> 24:26.920
pretty mouth...

24:32.696 --> 24:35.823
21 or 22. This isn't exactly
something I'm proud of.

24:36.038 --> 24:37.450
You're saying she's your alibi?

24:41.057 --> 24:42.422
Were you with her all night?

24:47.497 --> 24:50.473
Did you bring her back to a motel,
place where somebody could have seen her?

24:52.536 --> 24:54.272
I brought her to my office.

24:55.205 --> 24:56.331
Did you get a name?

24:56.786 --> 24:57.751
What for?

24:59.645 --> 25:01.800
But she's always there.

25:02.497 --> 25:05.762
I've seen her there since,
through my windshield out of Van Buren

25:06.857 --> 25:09.440
I'll be right back,
I've got patients backed up

25:10.826 --> 25:12.660
Let me just let them know,

25:13.357 --> 25:15.391
I will be running late.

25:19.958 --> 25:23.572
Interesting alibi. Hooker with no name.
I know I'm convinced.

25:24.897 --> 25:26.610
Actually for the most part,

25:27.837 --> 25:29.731
I think he's telling the truth.

25:29.986 --> 25:32.320
Great. So now, you're
this doctor's alibi?

25:34.647 --> 25:37.851
Kind of, I suppose,
but he doesn't know that.

25:39.485 --> 25:41.881
It's hard to believe a man of his
standing in the community

25:42.056 --> 25:45.761
would admit to the kind of things
he's admitted to if they weren't true.

25:46.675 --> 25:49.083
If he wasn't trying everything
in his power to prove us

25:49.266 --> 25:51.810
he has nothing to do
with Mary Stacey's murder.

25:52.615 --> 25:54.951
Did he mention anything
about drugging her?

25:55.145 --> 25:57.343
Doing all that dental work?
Hitting her?

25:57.776 --> 25:59.553
No, neither did I.

25:59.735 --> 26:01.920
I've been wrong
about so many things.

26:03.365 --> 26:05.511
Devalos is so devastated.

26:06.016 --> 26:08.902
He really wants to believe
that his client's innocent.

26:09.476 --> 26:11.652
And Cynthia Keener is thrilled

26:11.826 --> 26:15.560
now that Scanlon has every cop
on the street looking for Sally.

26:15.957 --> 26:19.821
She was more than happy to call
Sally's parents to take all the credit.

26:21.558 --> 26:25.192
Psychic's my kick, nothing
ever turns out the way I suspect.

26:26.296 --> 26:27.940
You think I'd know by now.

26:32.297 --> 26:35.671
Obviously is not the moment,
to ask my instinct about something?

26:36.316 --> 26:38.532
Don't be silly, I'm a glutton
for punishment.

26:40.748 --> 26:43.500
Do you think maybe my mom
is keeping something from me?

26:44.135 --> 26:45.112
Like what?

26:45.705 --> 26:48.351
I don't know, I'm starting to think that
this whole thing is really,

26:48.548 --> 26:49.553
kind of strange.

26:50.156 --> 26:51.953
Her flying out of here
to spread the moment,

26:52.136 --> 26:54.462
give a check that she
could quite easily have mailed.

26:54.665 --> 26:57.872
That "do it" look she gets in her eyes
whenever she so much as glances,

26:58.047 --> 26:59.752
at you, me, the kids.

27:00.228 --> 27:02.233
Next day, she's taking
a nap and the phone rang.

27:02.406 --> 27:04.302
It was the airline,
confirming a flight
back

27:04.476 --> 27:06.560
and saying that they were upgrade her business.

27:08.548 --> 27:09.170
So?

27:09.367 --> 27:11.933
So they were confirming
a flight back to Minneapolis.

27:12.108 --> 27:14.270
She lives in Crosspoint, Michigan,
not Minneapolis.

27:16.117 --> 27:18.123
I don't know what to say,
maybe you should ask her.

27:18.317 --> 27:21.183
I did, when she woke up.
And she said that she was,

27:21.457 --> 27:25.453
visiting a friend but I never heard her
mention anyone in Minneapolis before.

27:28.846 --> 27:32.312
I don't know what to tell you, maybe
it's a man, maybe she's embarrassed.

27:35.498 --> 27:37.282
I hadn't thought about that.

27:37.778 --> 27:39.102
Did she say something to you?

27:39.645 --> 27:41.221
About a man? No.

27:44.238 --> 27:46.502
Actually, that would kind of make sense.

27:46.757 --> 27:48.183
I kind of almost believe that.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.762
Explains the "do it" looks too.

27:53.865 --> 27:55.611
Maybe you're not
on the fritz after all.

27:58.008 --> 27:59.300
From your lips.

28:59.067 --> 28:59.870
Wait.

29:00.776 --> 29:03.623
Now you're saying
Leo Krane did kill Mary Stacey?

29:03.828 --> 29:06.750
I know, I sound like
I'm contradicting myself, but,

29:06.988 --> 29:10.391
I just saw it, I just dreamt it, there's
nothing vague or uncertain about it.

29:10.585 --> 29:13.401
Leo Krane, the dentist that
we visited this afternoon,

29:13.587 --> 29:17.073
douse that house with something
and burnt that woman alive.

29:17.647 --> 29:18.840
<i>If you say so.</i>

29:19.046 --> 29:20.573
What is that supposed to mean?

29:20.876 --> 29:23.541
That means
it's barely 4 o'clock in the morning.

29:23.796 --> 29:26.120
And frankly, I don't know
what you expect me to do about it.

29:26.316 --> 29:28.543
You say Leo's innocent,
the evidence says otherwise.

29:28.898 --> 29:30.230
What evidence?

29:30.506 --> 29:32.683
For one thing,
his alibi checks out.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.142
You're kidding me.

29:34.327 --> 29:37.111
We recanvassed the Van Buren area,
one of the working girls

29:37.307 --> 29:40.271
actually does remember seeing
Sally Greer getting into a car

29:40.448 --> 29:42.140
matching Leo Krane's that night.

29:47.527 --> 29:48.821
I know, I saw that too.

29:49.068 --> 29:52.032
<i>I want Manny to be right just as much
as you do,</i> but it's hard to understand

29:52.207 --> 29:54.541
why Krane would go to
all the trouble of picking up a hooker

29:54.727 --> 29:57.621
on Van Buren Street
just that he could race across town,

29:57.796 --> 29:59.792
and set Mary Stacey
and her house on fire.

29:59.986 --> 30:02.740
I'm sorry but all the evidence
still points to Manny's client,

30:02.938 --> 30:06.242
being guilty as hell. <i>I know he'll
sweat at that bail hearing tomorrow.</i>

30:06.426 --> 30:08.370
<i>I really wish I had something for him.</i>

30:10.888 --> 30:14.013
You got about 30 hours left,
anything can happen.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.290
Yeah, anything can happen.

30:19.905 --> 30:20.881
You're okay?

30:21.895 --> 30:24.653
What are you doing up?
It's barely 4 in the morning.

30:25.287 --> 30:26.901
I had that dream again.

30:27.728 --> 30:29.402
Heard you walking down the hall.

30:29.598 --> 30:30.732
You're sure you're ok?

30:31.688 --> 30:33.350
Tell me about your dream.

30:34.087 --> 30:36.350
There's really nothing to tell,
it's the same thing,

30:36.538 --> 30:39.080
the woman pours gasoline
all over herself,

30:39.708 --> 30:41.440
and then lights herself in fire.

30:41.616 --> 30:43.952
Except for this time
she did it in Barcelona.

30:45.527 --> 30:46.510
Barcelona?

30:47.518 --> 30:48.810
I don't know how.

30:49.006 --> 30:50.620
I just know it was there.

30:50.937 --> 30:53.201
Owen told me it was one
of her favourite places.

30:53.397 --> 30:55.173
She actually wanted
to be buried there.

30:56.327 --> 30:58.753
But what I don't understand
is why I keep seing it.

30:59.435 --> 31:01.343
And you told me
that's not how it happened.

31:01.536 --> 31:04.850
She didn't kill herself, then why do
I keep seeing it that way in my dreams?

31:05.237 --> 31:08.702
I don't know, sweetie, I keep seeing
things I can't make sense of, either.

31:10.446 --> 31:11.940
If she were alive, I'd understand

31:12.136 --> 31:14.663
that we've something to do
some place to go, something to stop.

31:17.436 --> 31:18.572
Wait a second.

31:19.128 --> 31:20.100
Say that again.

31:20.478 --> 31:22.040
- What?
- What you just said.

31:22.235 --> 31:24.601
If she were alive, there'd
be something to do, some place to go,

31:24.786 --> 31:25.802
something to stop.

31:26.437 --> 31:27.623
You just said it.

31:27.805 --> 31:30.071
Honey, do me a favour,
when daddy wakes up tell him

31:30.257 --> 31:31.943
I need him to take you guys to school.

31:32.767 --> 31:35.200
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to see Cynthia Keener.

31:35.395 --> 31:37.192
But it's really early in the morning.

31:37.378 --> 31:39.313
She loves it when I do that.

31:47.398 --> 31:50.342
I hope you have something
more meaningful to tell me this time.

31:50.628 --> 31:51.523
I don't.

31:52.436 --> 31:53.312
Excuse me?

31:53.856 --> 31:56.622
I have nothing to
offer you as an employee.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.931
I would like to hire you, though.

31:59.288 --> 32:00.763
You have a passport?

32:01.758 --> 32:03.012
I simply didn't do it.

32:03.206 --> 32:04.390
Order, please.

32:04.575 --> 32:07.271
If you interrupt the
District Attorney one more time...

32:08.338 --> 32:11.163
Will you remind your client
to refrain from speaking until such time

32:11.338 --> 32:12.572
as he's asked a question?

32:12.757 --> 32:15.182
Or I will have him return to his cell
and,

32:15.377 --> 32:16.911
this hearing will go on without him.

32:17.347 --> 32:20.441
Begging the Court's forgiveness,
Your Honor. It won't happen again.

32:20.646 --> 32:22.371
District Attorney Van Dyke,

32:22.798 --> 32:23.832
if you will,

32:24.045 --> 32:25.203
please proceed.

32:25.376 --> 32:28.972
Your honor, Graham Stacey is
the very definition of a flight risk.

32:29.498 --> 32:32.922
He was caught with the murder weapon,
he as a $7 million motive,

32:33.297 --> 32:36.131
and he was placed, by his own admission
at the scene of the crime.

32:36.326 --> 32:37.822
With all this against him,

32:38.017 --> 32:41.441
bail would send the wrong message
to the people of this community.

32:42.098 --> 32:44.933
That all a criminal needs to do
to gain the favour of the Court

32:45.126 --> 32:47.703
is to hire the former
District Attorney.

32:48.375 --> 32:49.383
Duly noted.

32:51.896 --> 32:55.160
Do you have a retort
before I reach a ruling?

32:58.988 --> 33:00.621
My apologies, Your Honor.

33:01.197 --> 33:04.382
Begging the Court's indulgence, I would
like to recall detective Lee Scanlon.

33:06.587 --> 33:07.560
I'll allow it.

33:19.575 --> 33:20.593
Detective,

33:21.098 --> 33:23.260
to the best of your knowledge,

33:23.455 --> 33:27.340
was the identity of the victim,
was the identity of Mary Stacey

33:27.525 --> 33:29.780
ever confirmed through DNA?

33:30.187 --> 33:32.343
No, it was not,
the body was too thoroughly burned,

33:32.537 --> 33:34.200
there was nothing to test.

33:34.436 --> 33:38.780
The id was made through dental records
and personal effects left on the body.

33:40.535 --> 33:42.820
Then, based on your
professional experience, and,

33:43.017 --> 33:46.591
mind you, this is purely hypothetical,
do you think it's possible

33:46.787 --> 33:48.633
that a dentist, a specialist,

33:48.917 --> 33:51.640
could alter another woman's teeth,

33:52.128 --> 33:54.601
to make her a match for
Mary Stacey's dental records.

33:55.995 --> 33:59.143
I don't know, he'd have to find
someone with the same build,

33:59.347 --> 34:01.182
similar teeth, similar jaw line...

34:01.365 --> 34:02.743
Objection, Your Honor.

34:03.288 --> 34:05.982
This is fascinating, but
where are we going with all this?

34:06.555 --> 34:09.013
This is a hearing about setting bail,
about

34:09.206 --> 34:12.003
this man being a flight risk.
Not about,

34:12.197 --> 34:15.120
the merits of dental records
for the purpose of identification.

34:15.708 --> 34:18.040
You'll have your chance to respond,
Mr. District Attorney.

34:18.427 --> 34:19.360
Proceed.

34:19.717 --> 34:21.550
I'm sorry. You were saying...

34:21.898 --> 34:23.983
And once you found the right person,

34:25.036 --> 34:28.893
a dentist would have to place
the right kind of fillings and crowns.

34:30.534 --> 34:33.020
Seems like a lot of work, I don't know
why anyone would do that.

34:33.428 --> 34:35.969
What if I told you that,
with Graham Stacey in prison,

34:36.156 --> 34:39.321
Mary Stacey $7 million
life insurance policy,

34:39.516 --> 34:41.703
would go to a charity called
the Dearbrook Foundation.

34:41.877 --> 34:42.862
The what?!

34:43.808 --> 34:45.922
Your Honor,
counsel is turning this hearing into...

34:46.106 --> 34:48.641
A foundation that happened
to be headed up by a local dentist

34:48.837 --> 34:50.692
by the name of Dr. Leo Krane.

34:51.505 --> 34:56.000
Who we believe colluded with Mary Stacey
to fake her own death, frame my client,

34:56.378 --> 34:58.690
so that she could cash in
her own life insurance policy.

34:58.866 --> 35:00.672
Your Honor, this is...

35:00.865 --> 35:04.091
We believe that the woman who died in
that house was not Mary Stacey at all,

35:04.285 --> 35:08.491
but a young runaway named Sally Greer,
who acted as a double, having her teeth

35:08.666 --> 35:11.830
teeth altered so she could provide
a false positive dental match.

35:12.196 --> 35:13.422
That's absurd.

35:14.248 --> 35:15.842
You can't prove that.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.571
So Mr. Devalos,
can you prove any of this?

35:19.796 --> 35:22.102
I may not be able to
prove who the burnt body is,

35:22.296 --> 35:24.020
but I believe,
with the help of a friend,

35:24.217 --> 35:26.140
who's working with
a private investigator,

35:26.325 --> 35:29.663
that I can prove beyond the shadow
of a doubt who the burnt body isn't.

35:31.978 --> 35:33.560
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:34.188 --> 35:36.673
I give you direct from Barcelona, Spain,

35:37.537 --> 35:38.643
Mary Stacey,

35:38.947 --> 35:41.050
and her accomplish
in crime Dr. Leo Krane.

35:49.197 --> 35:52.173
I move for immediate dismissal
of all charges against my client,

35:52.355 --> 35:56.303
who clearly did not kill his wife,
as anyone could plainly see,

35:56.636 --> 35:58.300
She is still very much alive.

36:01.177 --> 36:03.281
I'll see you both in my chambers.

36:03.706 --> 36:04.653
Right now.

36:05.485 --> 36:08.100
Hope you have an explanation
for this, Mr. District Attorney.

36:25.565 --> 36:26.562
Detective,

36:27.907 --> 36:31.673
when you finish here, you should report
your captain for reassignment.

36:32.635 --> 36:34.203
Nothing will please me more,

36:34.386 --> 36:35.641
Mr. District Attorney.

36:49.716 --> 36:50.751
You're okay?

36:52.257 --> 36:54.391
Did you dream, was it about Marjorie?

36:56.116 --> 36:57.353
What are you doing here?

36:57.536 --> 36:59.833
I asked you a question,
now my poor widow wife

37:00.016 --> 37:03.343
is getting ready to fly back to Michigan
and she's waiting for you to tell her

37:03.518 --> 37:06.413
whether she's gonna be alright.
What seems to be the hold up?

37:06.598 --> 37:07.763
What's the hold up?

37:07.948 --> 37:10.352
Hold up is that I
haven't dreamt about her.

37:11.216 --> 37:12.892
You're dead, so you tell me.

37:13.088 --> 37:16.570
You're supposed to be able to see all,
know all... So tell me,

37:17.247 --> 37:18.501
is she gonna pull through?

37:19.877 --> 37:20.960
I don't know.

37:22.305 --> 37:23.641
It doesn't work that way,

37:23.826 --> 37:25.472
not with people you love.

37:27.848 --> 37:31.023
What do you mean by that?
You tell me you can see everything,

37:31.458 --> 37:34.680
but not nothing that had really to do
with the people you love?

37:35.307 --> 37:37.352
I know. Sounds crazy, doesn't it?

37:38.217 --> 37:41.983
I asked about it at the orientation.
You know what they told me?

37:42.425 --> 37:44.240
They said if you could see

37:44.435 --> 37:47.610
everything that there's to
see about the people that you love,

37:47.787 --> 37:49.723
if you could know everything

37:49.918 --> 37:51.873
about the people you care about,

37:52.096 --> 37:54.761
there'd be no reason for you
to watch over them.

37:55.927 --> 37:59.011
And the whole damn system
would go to hell.

38:00.777 --> 38:01.461
Sorry.

38:02.975 --> 38:04.162
I don't get it.

38:06.368 --> 38:08.062
What do you want from me?

38:08.897 --> 38:10.882
You should let me call a cab.

38:11.067 --> 38:13.723
Don't be silly,
I like driving you, mom.

38:14.787 --> 38:16.323
You know what, this is just wrong.

38:16.516 --> 38:17.962
Let me wake Allison and the kids.

38:18.145 --> 38:20.911
No, it's barely 6 o'clock,
we said our goodbyes last night.

38:21.138 --> 38:25.141
But she never does, she never sleeps in,
because she usually has these dreams...

38:25.348 --> 38:26.923
I'm so glad I didn't miss you.

38:28.635 --> 38:30.660
You didn't have to pull
yourself out of bed.

38:31.438 --> 38:35.742
Don't be silly. I wanted to. The only
reason I wasn't up earlier is that...

38:36.455 --> 38:38.712
I was having a dream

38:39.705 --> 38:40.611
about you...

38:43.266 --> 38:46.230
About me? Why on earth
would you dream about me?

38:46.705 --> 38:48.113
What was this dream?

38:49.668 --> 38:51.420
We were in your living room.

38:53.177 --> 38:55.493
It was Ariel, Bridgette, Marie...

38:56.955 --> 38:59.753
Bridgette had just graduated
from college.

39:00.388 --> 39:01.423
And then,

39:02.256 --> 39:03.862
we came in your living room,

39:04.045 --> 39:06.351
and Joe had his hands over your eyes.

39:06.818 --> 39:08.972
And then it was like... Surprise!

39:09.148 --> 39:11.613
And there was this big birthday cake,

39:11.807 --> 39:14.153
and you were the
picture of health and...

39:14.578 --> 39:16.601
This was a lovely dream!

39:23.776 --> 39:26.270
You're right, that's a lovely dream.

39:32.708 --> 39:36.043
It's a nice dream, isn't the
best dream I've ever heard, but...

39:37.075 --> 39:40.533
I think you have something to
tell someone on the way to the airport?

39:41.656 --> 39:42.740
Yes I do.

39:43.976 --> 39:45.880
I have no idea
what is going on here.

39:46.067 --> 39:48.691
Don't worry about it.
We have a plane to catch.

39:50.655 --> 39:51.950
I'll see you soon.

39:53.415 --> 39:54.723
I'll see you soon.

40:00.625 --> 40:02.110
I'll see you soon.

40:02.286 --> 40:03.870
Get out of here!

40:06.715 --> 40:08.301
You know what doctors say...

40:08.885 --> 40:11.341
60% of the battle is thinking positive.

40:12.517 --> 40:13.800
So I've heard.

40:15.225 --> 40:16.652
You did a good thing.
