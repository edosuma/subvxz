YOU'RE GOING!

17:56.492 --> 17:57.034
BETTER HOP ON, NELLA.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.119
YOU SAID IT, TRINKET.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.079
{\an1}CICI,
BE CAREFUL! WAIT!

18:01.163 --> 18:06.668
NO. I'M NOT GONNA WEAR
MY--OOH!--GLASSES!

18:06.752 --> 18:08.045
UGH!

18:09.421 --> 18:14.510
{\an5}HORSEFLIES! CICI'S
HEADED STRAIGHT
FOR THE SWAMP!

18:14.593 --> 18:17.387
{\an1}OH, NO, CICI'S
GONNA GET SOAKED!

18:17.471 --> 18:19.807
{\an1}AND RUIN THOSE
BEAUTIFUL PIGTAILS!

18:19.890 --> 18:21.350
{\an1}NOT IF THIS
PRINCESS KNIGHT

18:21.433 --> 18:23.352
{\an1}HAS ANYTHING TO SAY
ABOUT IT.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.188
WUH-WUH-WHOOOA!

18:32.402 --> 18:34.029

SEEN EVERYTHING.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.040
THANKS, NELLA. OHH.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.877
I ALMOST GOT SOAKED
IN THAT SWAMP.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.755
GUESS I DIDN'T
SEE IT.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.383
{\an1}I DON'T MEAN TO BE
PUSHY, CICI, BUT

18:54.466 --> 18:56.218
MAYBE WEARING
YOUR GLASSES

18:56.301 --> 18:58.929
{\an1}MIGHT NOT BE
SUCH A BAD IDEA.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.722
I DON'T WANT TO
WEAR THEM, TRINKET,

19:00.806 --> 19:03.559
EVEN IF THEY DO
HELP ME SEE BETTER.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.102
{\an1}BUT CICI,
IF YOU CAN'T SEE,

19:05.185 --> 19:06.895
{\an1}HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO DO ALL THE THINGS

19:06.979 --> 19:08.647
{\an1}YOU LIKE
TO DO, LIKE

19:08.730 --> 19:10.023
GOING ON QUESTS?

19:10.107 --> 19:12.067
OR DOING THOSE
CUTE PIGTAILS?

19:12.150 --> 19:15.737
{\an8}OR HAVING ADVENTURES
IN EXCITING PLACES?

19:15.821 --> 19:17.239
{\an1}OR DANCING
IN BALLET RECITALS?

19:17.322 --> 19:19.783
IT WOULD BE KINDA NICE
TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.744
IT'S JUST THAT [SIGH]

19:22.828 --> 19:25.247
I REALLY DON'T LIKE
WEARING GLASSES.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.748
BUT WHY NOT?

19:26.832 --> 19:28.667
{\an8}BECAUSE THEY'RE
FUNNY-LOOKING,

19:28.750 --> 19:30.419
{\an8}AND THEY PINCH MY EARS,

19:30.502 --> 19:32.087
{\an8}AND THEY MAKE ME LOOK

19:32.170 --> 19:33.630
DIFFERENT.

19:33.714 --> 19:34.840
{\an1}YEAH, BUT DIFFERENT
IS GREAT.

19:34.923 --> 19:37.342
IT'S GREATER
THAN GREAT.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.261
DIFFERENT IS WHAT
MAKES YOU YOU.

19:39.344 --> 19:43.348
BUT SOMETIMES, I FEEL
LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE

19:43.432 --> 19:45.267
WHO HAS TO WEAR GLASSES.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.978
{\an5}HORSE HOOVES!
LOTS OF PEOPLE
WEAR GLASSES.

19:48.061 --> 19:51.315
I WEAR THESE
JUST FOR READING.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.107
BEYOND FAB.

19:52.190 --> 19:55.444
WHOA! EVEN WITHOUT MY GLASSES,

19:55.527 --> 19:58.947
I CAN SEE THOSE ARE
PRETTY SPARKLY.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.034

NOW LET'S SEE YOURS.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.994

20:06.330 --> 20:11.168

JUST SO...

20:11.251 --> 20:12.085

20:12.169 --> 20:15.631

IS SO FIERCE!

20:15.714 --> 20:16.965
{\an8}WHAT TRINKET MEANS

20:17.049 --> 20:20.719
{\an7}IS YOUR GLASSES
ARE BEAUTIFUL, CICI.

20:20.802 --> 20:21.929
OH, MY GOSH.
SUPER IDEA.

20:22.012 --> 20:25.807
CICI, WHY DON'T YOU WEAR
THEM BACK TO THE CASTLE?
