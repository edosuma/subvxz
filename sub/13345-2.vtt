WEBVTT

00:29.530 --> 00:31.332
( door opens )

00:31.432 --> 00:33.134
APRIL.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.311
( theme music playing )

01:01.262 --> 01:03.431
( traffic in distance )

01:07.668 --> 01:09.603
SORRY, SHOULD I SIT?

01:09.703 --> 01:11.339
IF YOU WANT TO.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.409
NICE BONES.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.245
I JUST--

01:17.345 --> 01:19.513
I LIKE TO TAKE IN A SPACE
WHEN I ENTER IT.

01:19.613 --> 01:23.317
I'M STUDYING ARCHITECTURE
AND THEY SORT OF TRAIN US

01:23.417 --> 01:25.386
TO ALWAYS BE AWARE
OF OUR SURROUNDINGS

01:25.486 --> 01:28.189
SO THAT--
AM I TALKING TOO MUCH?

01:29.923 --> 01:33.694
- WHAT?
- PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY ASK
THAT QUESTION IN HERE.

01:36.197 --> 01:39.099
- I REALLY LIKE YOUR OFFICE.
- WELL, THANK YOU.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.702
- D.I.Y.?
- I'M SORRY?

01:42.970 --> 01:44.972
UH, DID YOU
DO IT YOURSELF

01:45.072 --> 01:46.774
OR DID YOU USE
AN INTERIOR DECORATOR?

01:46.874 --> 01:48.409
NO NO, I--

01:48.509 --> 01:50.544
- SO THIS IS ALL YOU?
- MM-HMM.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.614
- I'M IMPRESSED.
- OH, THANK YOU.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.694
( April inhales deeply )

02:08.028 --> 02:10.431
SO, APRIL,

02:10.531 --> 02:12.633
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT YOURSELF.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.670
WHAT--
WHAT SPECIFICALLY?

02:16.770 --> 02:20.441
WELL, WHATEVER YOU THINK
I-- I SHOULD KNOW.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.311
( clears throat )
I'M 23,

02:23.411 --> 02:25.913
I GO TO PRATT,
I'M STUDYING ARCHITECTURE--

02:26.013 --> 02:28.148
I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT--

02:28.249 --> 02:30.518
( clears throat )
AND URBAN PLANNING.

02:30.618 --> 02:33.554
IT'S A THREE-YEAR PROGRAM.
I'M IN MY SECOND YEAR.

02:36.156 --> 02:40.127
MY PARENTS ARE BOTH ALIVE
AND STILL MARRIED
TO EACH OTHER.

02:40.228 --> 02:43.297
I HAVE A BROTHER--
DANIEL.

02:43.397 --> 02:46.267
HE'S A YEAR
AND A HALF YOUNGER.
WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE.

02:48.836 --> 02:52.540
I'M SINGLE...
RECENTLY.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.642
VERY RECENTLY.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.711
WE WERE TOGETHER SINCE
THE FIRST WEEK AT PRATT.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.449
SO IS, UH--

03:01.549 --> 03:04.785
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'VE COME TO--
TO TALK ABOUT?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.621
MY BREAKUP?

03:10.090 --> 03:11.792
I WISH.

03:17.431 --> 03:20.100
NO, MY--
MY BREAKUP WAS

03:20.200 --> 03:23.437
REALLY FINE,
TOTALLY AMICABLE.

03:23.537 --> 03:27.107
KYLE WAS REALLY
INCREDIBLY CIVIL
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.243
WE'RE STILL GOOD FRIENDS.

03:30.544 --> 03:35.749
AND HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND'S
JUST... DELIGHTFUL.

03:35.849 --> 03:40.020
AND HER FATHER
OWNS FIVE BUILDINGS
ON PARK AVENUE,

03:40.120 --> 03:42.690
SO THAT'S NICE.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.962
I'M SORRY, I'M REALLY BAD
AT TALKING ABOUT MYSELF.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.365
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO ASK ME QUESTIONS
OR SOMETHING.

03:51.465 --> 03:55.636
- ARE YOU THAT KIND
OF SHRINK?
- I CAN BE.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.239
I FOUND
YOUR NAME ONLINE--

03:59.340 --> 04:02.343
PRATT LISTSERV.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.345
I WANTED SOMEBODY
CLOSE TO SCHOOL

04:04.445 --> 04:07.381
WHO ACTUALLY TAKES
MY HEALTH PLAN.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.184
NOBODY HAD COMMENTED
ON YOUR PAGE.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.521
UM, THERE'S A SPACE

04:13.621 --> 04:15.255
WHERE PATIENTS
CAN RECOMMEND
OR NOT RECOMMEND.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.124
YOURS WAS EMPTY.

04:17.224 --> 04:20.928
THAT'S PROBABLY
'CAUSE I'VE JUST RECENTLY
MOVED TO THE AREA.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.298
I ASSUMED IT WAS
A NEW PRACTICE.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.699
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE YOUNGER.

04:25.799 --> 04:29.303
OH. WOULD YOU PREFER
A YOUNGER THERAPIST?

04:29.403 --> 04:32.072
NO. NO, ACTUALLY.

04:32.172 --> 04:35.008
YOU SEEM GREAT.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.248
HOW'S BUSINESS?
HARD?

04:41.349 --> 04:43.617
WHY'D YOU MOVE?

04:45.653 --> 04:46.920
I'M SORRY.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.222
( chuckles )

04:49.323 --> 04:51.191
WELL, I-- I JUST
CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE

04:51.291 --> 04:54.061
THAT THIS IS
THE THIRD TIME
THAT YOU HAVE--

04:54.161 --> 04:55.896
THAT YOU'VE
APOLOGIZED TO ME.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.831
MMM.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.634
I'M NOT REALLY SORRY.
I WAS JUST BEING POLITE.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.336
OKAY, I JUST WANT
YOU TO KNOW THAT

05:02.436 --> 05:04.472
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE

05:04.572 --> 05:07.007
FOR ANYTHING IN HERE,
ANYTHING THAT YOU SAY.

05:07.107 --> 05:10.243
YOU CAN'T--
YOU CAN'T OFFEND ME.

05:10.344 --> 05:13.881
- I CAN'T?
- WELL, OF COURSE
YOU CAN, BUT...

05:13.981 --> 05:16.717
I CAN TAKE IT.

05:16.817 --> 05:20.854
WHAT I MEAN IS
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
CENSOR YOURSELF

05:20.954 --> 05:22.790
TO SPARE MY FEELINGS.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.025
OKAY.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.598
SO IS THIS
YOUR FIRST TIME MEETING
WITH A PSYCHOLOGIST?

05:31.632 --> 05:33.501
NO, I SAW SOMEBODY
AT SCHOOL.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.436
THEY GIVE YOU
NINE WEEKS FOR FREE

05:35.536 --> 05:37.838
- OVER THE COURSE
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR, SO--
- NINE WEEKS,

05:37.938 --> 05:39.540
THAT'S--
THAT'S NOT LONG.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.509
WELL, IT WOULD'VE
BEEN PLENTY

05:41.609 --> 05:43.477
IF SHE HADN'T BEEN
SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.913
FIRST OF ALL,

05:46.013 --> 05:49.850
JENNIFER WAS
BARELY OLDER THAN ME.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.320
ONE OF THOSE GIRLS WHO--

05:53.421 --> 05:55.489
YOU COULD JUST TELL
SHE BECAME A THERAPIST

05:55.589 --> 05:57.425
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO
WITH HER LIFE,

05:57.525 --> 05:59.927
LIKE SHE WOKE UP
ONE MORNING

06:00.027 --> 06:01.762
AND THOUGHT,

06:01.862 --> 06:05.098
"I LOOK LIKE
I'M A GOOD LISTENER

06:05.198 --> 06:06.434
AND I HAVE NOTHING
REALLY TO SAY.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.869
I KNOW!
I'LL BE A THERAPIST."

06:08.969 --> 06:12.272
- NO OFFENSE.
- THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S FINE.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.307
( chuckles )

06:14.408 --> 06:17.678
SHE WAS JUST WAITING
FOR SOME...

06:17.778 --> 06:20.047
RICH DOCTOR
IN A BAD MARRIAGE

06:20.147 --> 06:23.216
TO CRAWL INTO HER OFFICE
AND FALL IN LOVE WITH HER

06:23.316 --> 06:25.886
SO SHE COULD GIVE UP
THE WHOLE CHARADE.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.955
I COULD JUST TELL
WHEN I WAS SITTING THERE
IN FRONT OF HER

06:28.055 --> 06:31.592
SHE WAS THINKING
"THIS GIRL IS A COMPLETE
WASTE OF TIME."

06:31.692 --> 06:35.429
- AND WHAT
TOLD YOU THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.432
IT WAS JUST
THIS FEELING
I HAD, THIS...

06:38.532 --> 06:41.535
POLITE GLAZE
IN HER EYE.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.472
ALSO, SHE TOLD ME
THE SAME STORY TWICE,

06:44.572 --> 06:46.106
WHICH WAS
PRETTY DISHEARTENING.

06:46.206 --> 06:49.409
- IN THE SAME SESSION?
- NO, TWO DIFFERENT SESSIONS.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.211
OH, SO YOU WENT
TO SEE HER AGAIN?

06:51.311 --> 06:53.413
YEAH, I FIGURED
I OWED IT TO HER.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.415
HOW DO YOU MEAN
THAT YOU OWED IT TO HER?

06:55.516 --> 06:59.052
SHE WAS A NICE PERSON.
SHE WAS TRYING.

06:59.152 --> 07:02.623
HMM. SO WHAT WAS
THE STORY,

07:02.723 --> 07:04.658
THE ONE THAT
SHE TOLD YOU TWICE?

07:04.758 --> 07:07.628
IT'S NOT SIGNIFICANT.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.432
I MEAN,
IT'S NOT EVEN A STORY.
IT'S MORE OF A JOKE.

07:12.533 --> 07:16.236
- YOU PROBABLY KNOW IT.
- MAYBE NOT.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.171
TRY ME.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.776
IT'S THE ONE
ABOUT THE HICK WHO
COMES TO NEW YORK...

07:23.844 --> 07:27.280
AND EVERYONE'S
MOVING REALLY FAST.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.182
NOBODY GIVES HIM
THE TIME OF DAY.

07:29.282 --> 07:33.153
TAXIS CUT HIM OFF.
PEOPLE TRY TO PICK
HIS POCKET.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.422
AND ALL HE WANTS TO DO

07:35.523 --> 07:37.591
IS GET TO THE MUSEUM
OF NATURAL HISTORY

07:37.691 --> 07:41.361
TO SEE THE DINOSAURS,
BUT HE CAN'T FIND IT.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.364
YOU KNOW,
HE CAN'T FIND IT,

07:44.464 --> 07:46.399
HE'S WALKING
IN CIRCLES.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.436
SO FINALLY HE WALKS

07:49.537 --> 07:51.572
RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE
OF TIMES SQUARE,

07:51.672 --> 07:53.807
TAPS A COP
ON THE SOLDIER

07:53.907 --> 07:55.909
AND SAYS,
"EXCUSE ME, OFFICER.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.378
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW
TO GET TO THE NATURAL
HISTORY MUSEUM,

07:58.478 --> 08:00.514
OR SHOULD I JUST
GO FUCK MYSELF?"

08:00.614 --> 08:02.415
( chuckles )
I'VE HEARD IT, YEAH.

08:02.516 --> 08:05.786
IT'S A--
IT'S A CLASSIC.

08:05.886 --> 08:09.757
YEAH. WELL, SHE TOLD IT
TO ME TWICE,

08:09.857 --> 08:11.391
AND IT WASN'T FUNNY
THE FIRST TIME.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.894
- MMM.
- WHEN I DIDN'T GO BACK,

08:13.994 --> 08:16.864
SHE CALLED ME
LIKE 87 TIMES.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.066
I WAS LIKE
"TAKE A HINT, LADY."

08:19.166 --> 08:21.434
DO YOU THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
SHE DIDN'T KNOW

08:21.535 --> 08:23.937
THAT YOU HAD CHOSEN
TO STOP THERAPY?

08:24.037 --> 08:26.106
HOW MANY PHONE CALLS DOES
A PERSON NEED TO IGNORE

08:26.206 --> 08:28.441
BEFORE YOU REALIZE
THEY DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU?

08:28.542 --> 08:30.811
MM-HMM. SO YOU NEVER
SPOKE TO HER AGAIN

08:30.911 --> 08:32.846
AFTER YOU DECIDED
NOT TO CONTINUE THERAPY?

08:32.946 --> 08:35.949
I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY TO HER.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.218
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO COME BACK TO THERAPY.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.755
I JUST WONDER
WHY YOU FELT THAT
YOU COULDN'T JUST--

08:41.855 --> 08:45.759
- JUST TELL HER.
- I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT
HER FEELINGS.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.066
THE-- OKAY,
FIRST OF ALL,

08:53.166 --> 08:55.736
THE WOMAN WAS
BORDERLINE STALKING ME.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.771
I'VE HAD FRIENDS WHO'VE
GONE TO THERAPY AT SCHOOL

08:57.871 --> 09:00.808
AND IF YOU QUIT,
THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO CALL YOU ONCE,

09:00.908 --> 09:02.475
SEND YOU A LETTER
AND THAT'S IT.

09:02.576 --> 09:06.346
JENNIFER WAS
WAY OVER THE LINE.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.281
SECOND OF ALL,
SHE WAS AN IDIOT.

09:08.381 --> 09:13.186
AND THIRD OF ALL,
DO YOU KNOW HER
OR SOMETHING?

09:13.286 --> 09:14.922
NO, I--
I DON'T THINK SO.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.625
- WHY?
- BECAUSE YOU SEEM
REALLY INVESTED

09:17.725 --> 09:19.459
IN MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER

09:19.559 --> 09:21.662
AND THE WHOLE REASON
I CAME TO YOU WAS

09:21.762 --> 09:23.764
BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK
THAT YOU KNEW

09:23.864 --> 09:26.600
- ANYBODY THAT I KNOW.
- WELL, I'M TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND

09:26.700 --> 09:29.236
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO TELL ME

09:29.336 --> 09:31.571
WHEN YOU TELL ME
THIS STORY.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.106
WHOA. DUDE, BACK UP.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.475
I WASN'T TRYING
TO TELL YOU ANYTHING.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.277
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO BROUGHT HER UP.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.780
CAN I ASK YOU IF--

09:39.880 --> 09:42.750
IF ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENED
IN THOSE SESSIONS

09:42.850 --> 09:46.286
THAT MIGHT HAVE
DISTURBED YOU?

09:46.386 --> 09:48.889
OH MY GOD.
I JUST TOLD YOU

09:48.989 --> 09:51.191
THE WOMAN HAD OATMEAL
BETWEEN HER EARS.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.494
SHE BARELY NOTICED ME.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.130
I MENTIONED THAT
MY BROTHER WAS AUTISTIC,

09:57.230 --> 09:58.966
THAT HE TOOK UP A LOT
OF MY MOTHER'S TIME,

09:59.066 --> 10:01.134
AND SHE WAS LIKE
"THAT MUST'VE BEEN
HARD FOR YOU.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.804
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE ANGRY
AT YOUR BROTHER?"

10:03.904 --> 10:06.807
AND I WAS LIKE
"I LOVE MY BROTHER,

10:06.907 --> 10:09.376
BUT I COULD THROW YOU OFF
A BRIDGE RIGHT NOW, BITCH."

10:13.380 --> 10:15.415
( stammers )
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOU PEOPLE.

10:15.515 --> 10:18.385
I THOUGHT
I COULD COME HERE

10:18.485 --> 10:22.422
AND, YOU KNOW,
SOMEBODY MIGHT
ACTUALLY LISTEN TO ME

10:22.522 --> 10:24.658
AND INSTEAD
ALL YOU WANT TO DO

10:24.758 --> 10:26.159
IS WASTE MY TIME TALKING
ABOUT MY FIRST SHRINK

10:26.259 --> 10:28.561
AND WHAT A FUCKING
DISASTER SHE WAS.

10:28.662 --> 10:32.232
I DON'T THINK WE'VE
BEEN WASTING OUR TIME.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.704
- OF COURSE YOU DON'T.
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.473
IT MAY SEEM TO YOU
LIKE I'M A BIT SLOW
ON THE UPTAKE,

10:40.573 --> 10:42.876
BUT I-- I REALLY HAVE
BEEN LISTENING.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.012
AND I THINK I KNOW
A LITTLE BIT MORE NOW

10:45.112 --> 10:49.182
ABOUT WHAT'S
IMPORTANT TO YOU.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.986
WELL, YOU'VE TOLD ME
NOT TO TELL YOU THINGS TWICE,

10:53.086 --> 10:56.023
NOT TO FEED YOU PLATITUDES,
NOT TO WASTE YOUR TIME.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.191
YOU'VE TOLD ME THAT
YOU'RE FIERCELY LOYAL
TO YOUR FAMILY

10:58.291 --> 11:01.995
AND IF I FAIL TO ENGAGE YOU,
YOU'LL DISAPPEAR ON ME,

11:02.095 --> 11:05.265
EVEN IF I CALL YOU
87 TIMES.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.942
IT WASN'T REALLY
87 TIMES.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.612
OKAY.

11:19.713 --> 11:24.151
SO-- SO WHAT HAVE YOU
COME HERE TO TALK ABOUT?

11:27.054 --> 11:30.223
HOW MANY PEOPLE
COME TO YOU WITH

11:30.323 --> 11:32.592
A REALLY BIG PROBLEM?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.762
LIKE WHAT?

11:35.562 --> 11:37.097
I DON'T KNOW--

11:37.197 --> 11:40.768
A DEATH, A RAPE.
I DON'T KNOW.

11:40.868 --> 11:45.105
ANYTHING THAT
YOU TELL ME I CAN HANDLE.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.875
I WASN'T RAPED.
DON'T WORRY.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.752
I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU.
I JUST, UH...

12:00.921 --> 12:03.156
I CAN'T GET THE WORDS
OUT OF MY MOUTH.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.160
- CAN I WRITE IT DOWN?
- OF COURSE.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.450
( pen clicks )

13:15.362 --> 13:17.197
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

13:19.166 --> 13:21.268
( sighs )

13:22.202 --> 13:24.437
TIRED.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.511
WHAT TYPE
OF CANCER IS IT?

13:34.948 --> 13:38.318
YOU KNOW WHAT? I--

13:39.953 --> 13:42.689
I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.858
I, UM--

13:44.958 --> 13:47.060
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL SOMEONE.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.363
I HAVE SO MUCH OTHER SHIT
ON MY MIND RIGHT NOW.

13:50.463 --> 13:53.500
THIS PROJECT IS DUE
IN TWO WEEKS.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.203
I HAVE SO MUCH
DRAFTING TO DO,

13:56.303 --> 13:58.906
NOT TO MENTION THE MODEL,
WHICH I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.541
I'M SO FUCKED.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.546
ARE YOU SLEEPING?

14:06.646 --> 14:09.649
NOT REALLY, NO.

14:09.749 --> 14:13.053
I WAKE UP
IN THESE COLD SWEATS.
THEY'RE PRETTY AWFUL.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.523
THE WHOLE BED
IS SOAKED.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.461
NIGHT SWEATS ARE APPARENTLY
A VERY COMMON SYMPTOM

14:21.561 --> 14:23.563
OF LYMPHOMA...

14:26.366 --> 14:28.235
AND OTHER THINGS
YOU NEVER WANTED TO KNOW.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.570
( chuckles )

14:30.670 --> 14:33.006
SO HOW LONG
HAVE YOU KNOWN?

14:34.574 --> 14:36.509
FIVE WEEKS.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.512
AND...

14:39.612 --> 14:41.548
HOW DID
YOU FIND OUT?

14:43.016 --> 14:45.052
I HAD A COUGH.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.922
IT WAS TOTALLY MINOR,
BUT IT WOULDN'T GO AWAY.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.925
AND IT WAS EMBARRASSING
TO BE SITTING IN CLASS

14:52.025 --> 14:53.226
COUGHING ALL THE TIME.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.929
SO I WENT
TO THE HEALTH CENTER

14:56.029 --> 14:58.465
AND THEY GAVE ME
ANTIBIOTICS.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.167
BUT THEY DIDN'T HELP,

15:00.267 --> 15:01.834
WHICH IS NOT
REALLY A SURPRISE

15:01.935 --> 15:04.037
BECAUSE THE HEALTH CENTER
IS TOTAL SHIT.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.173
WE HAVE THIS JOKE THAT

15:06.273 --> 15:09.209
YOU COULD GO IN THERE
BLEEDING PROFUSELY
FROM YOUR HEAD

15:09.309 --> 15:12.312
AND IF YOU'RE A WOMAN,
THEY'LL GIVE YOU
A PREGNANCY TEST.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.783
SO, YOU KNOW,
I FIGURED I'D SUCK IT UP

15:16.883 --> 15:19.286
AND WHENEVER
I FINALLY TALKED TO MY DAD

15:19.386 --> 15:21.721
- HE'D TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.
- IS HE A DOCTOR?

15:21.821 --> 15:23.890
IN THE ARMY.

15:23.991 --> 15:27.227
HE'S SUPPOSED TO
BE RETIRED, BUT...

15:27.327 --> 15:29.862
NOW HE'S WORKING
WITH THE V.A.,

15:29.963 --> 15:31.431
AND THEY'RE
SO UNDERSTAFFED,

15:31.531 --> 15:34.601
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO GET HIM ON THE PHONE.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.670
ANYWAY, WHERE AM I?

15:37.770 --> 15:40.207
YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR COUGH.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.242
RIGHT.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.378
SO I COULDN'T REACH
MY DAD

15:45.478 --> 15:47.447
AND THEN...

15:47.547 --> 15:50.317
I STARTED HAVING
THESE AWFUL NIGHT SWEATS,

15:51.751 --> 15:55.022
SO I WENT BACK TO THE CENTER
AND GUESS WHAT THEY DID.

15:55.122 --> 15:58.558
- WHAT?
- ACCUSED ME
OF TAKING DIET PILLS...

15:58.658 --> 16:00.760
OR COCAINE.

16:00.860 --> 16:04.231
THE DOCTORS
COULDN'T AGREE ON WHAT
CONTROLLED-SUBSTANCE ABUSE

16:04.331 --> 16:08.601
I WAS KEEPING FROM THEM,
SO THAT WAS AWESOME.

16:11.404 --> 16:14.574
FINALLY SOMEONE HAD
THE BRIGHT IDEA

16:14.674 --> 16:18.278
TO SEND ME
TO BROOKLYN HOSPITAL
TO GET A CHEST X-RAY,

16:18.378 --> 16:22.515
AND THEN--
WELL, THE REST IS HISTORY.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.822
I HAVE A BIG MASS

16:29.922 --> 16:32.392
BEHIND MY SPINE.

16:37.597 --> 16:41.101
DON'T EVER GET
A BONE-MARROW BIOPSY, OKAY?

16:41.201 --> 16:43.836
JUST TELL THEM
TO FIND ANOTHER WAY.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.505
OKAY.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.441
THEY DO IT IN FRONT
OF 10 MEDICAL STUDENTS,

16:48.541 --> 16:51.378
AND THEY'RE ALL FLIRTING
WITH EACH OTHER

16:51.478 --> 16:54.947
AS IF YOU'RE NOT EVEN
IN THE ROOM, YOU KNOW?

16:55.048 --> 16:58.218
AS IF YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD
AND IT'S AN AUTOPSY.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.121
IT SOUNDS HORRIBLE.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.057
PRIMARY MEDIASTINAL

17:04.157 --> 17:07.060
LARGE B-CELL,
NON-HODGKINS LYMPHOMA.

17:09.096 --> 17:12.299
YOU'VE MET-- YOU'VE MET
WITH AN ONCOLOGIST?

17:12.399 --> 17:15.034
YEAH, THE SAME DAY
I WAS DIAGNOSED.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.204
HMM. WERE YOU ALONE?

17:17.304 --> 17:19.172
YES.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.873
YOU DIDN'T WANT
ANYBODY TO GO WITH YOU?

17:20.973 --> 17:23.610
- LIKE WHO?
- A FRIEND...

17:23.710 --> 17:25.245
- NO.
- ...OR PARENT.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.914
- HELL NO.
- HOW DID YOUR MOM
AND DAD REACT

17:28.014 --> 17:29.482
WHEN YOU TOLD THEM
THAT YOU WERE SICK?

17:29.582 --> 17:31.684
I HAVEN'T TOLD THEM.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.057
SO WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?

17:39.259 --> 17:42.729
- YOU.
- ME.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.666
MMM. ANYBODY ELSE?

17:49.001 --> 17:51.371
A CONSTRUCTION WORKER.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.143
ONE OF MY BIGGEST
PET PEEVES IS

17:56.243 --> 17:57.844
WHEN I'M WALKING
DOWN THE STREET

17:57.944 --> 17:59.846
AND SOME ASSHOLE
AT A BUILDING SITE

17:59.946 --> 18:01.581
TELLS ME TO SMILE,
YOU KNOW?

18:01.681 --> 18:05.185
LIKE "SMILE, SWEETHEART.
IT AIN'T THAT BAD."

18:05.285 --> 18:08.288
SO-- YOU KNOW,
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED

18:08.388 --> 18:11.424
TO SAY SOMETHING BACK
THAT WOULD REALLY SHUT
THOSE GUYS UP.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.960
SO THE OTHER MORNING
I WAS WALKING TO SCHOOL,

18:14.060 --> 18:16.663
AND THIS GUY YELLS OUT

18:16.763 --> 18:21.368
"HEY, DOLL FACE,
SMILE WILL YOU?
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MORNING,"

18:21.468 --> 18:24.337
AND I SHOUTED BACK,
"I HAVE CANCER!"

18:24.437 --> 18:26.539
IT WAS AWESOME.
( laughing )

18:34.347 --> 18:38.385
WELL, NOT REALLY.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.923
SO THE ONLY PEOPLE
THAT YOU'VE TOLD

18:44.023 --> 18:45.425
ABOUT THIS ARE

18:45.525 --> 18:49.162
THIS CONSTRUCTION
WORKER AND ME?

18:49.262 --> 18:52.332
I WANTED TO TALK
TO SOMEONE WHO WAS...

18:54.000 --> 18:55.568
OBJECTIVE,

18:55.668 --> 18:58.638
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.341
YOU CARE I'M SURE,
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A HUMAN BEING,

19:01.441 --> 19:03.810
BUT YOU WON'T
GET HYSTERICAL
IF I TELL YOU THAT--

19:03.910 --> 19:07.347
I DON'T KNOW--
THAT MAYBE I DON'T WANT
TO GET TREATMENT.

19:07.447 --> 19:10.317
YOU KNOW, LIKE IF I TELL YOU
MAYBE I WANT TO DIE

19:10.417 --> 19:12.319
RIGHT NOW, RIGHT HERE,
ON YOUR COUCH,

19:12.419 --> 19:15.087
YOU'RE NOT GONNA--
I DON'T KNOW--

19:15.188 --> 19:17.690
JUMP OUT
THE WINDOW, RIGHT?

19:21.728 --> 19:23.363
I JUST-- I JUST

19:23.463 --> 19:26.333
NEED TO THINK ABOUT
ALL THIS FOR A MOMENT--

19:27.834 --> 19:31.003
MAYBE SEE AN HERBALIST,
AN ACUPUNCTURIST
OR SOMETHING,

19:31.103 --> 19:33.906
FIGURE OUT WHAT
MY OPTIONS ARE BEFORE
I START TELLING EVERYONE

19:34.006 --> 19:37.644
AND MANAGING
THE HYSTERIA.

19:37.744 --> 19:40.413
WHO WOULD BECOME HYSTERICAL
IF YOU TOLD THEM?

19:43.616 --> 19:45.318
YOUR MOTHER?

19:48.621 --> 19:50.557
YOUR FATHER?

19:52.959 --> 19:55.295
AND YOUR BROTHER?

19:55.395 --> 19:58.931
DANIEL DOESN'T GET
HYSTERICAL.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.067
VIOLENT,
BUT NOT HYSTERICAL.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.703
- VIOLENT AGAINST WHOM?
- WHAT?

20:03.803 --> 20:06.606
NO, NOBODY.
HIMSELF.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.541
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, IT'S--

20:08.641 --> 20:10.910
YOU SEEM TO ME
TO BE REALLY...

20:11.010 --> 20:13.413
INDEPENDENT.

20:14.847 --> 20:18.651
AND I CAN IMAGINE
THAT THE IDEA OF...

20:19.752 --> 20:22.689
ACCEPTING TREATMENT...

20:24.657 --> 20:26.626
PUTTING YOURSELF
IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S HANDS--

20:26.726 --> 20:28.828
I CAN IMAGINE THAT
THAT WOULD BE

20:28.928 --> 20:30.630
KIND OF SCARY.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.999
I JUST TOLD YOU I WANT
TO EXPLORE MY OPTIONS--

20:33.099 --> 20:36.869
- MEDITATION, YOGA--
- THESE ARE GOOD
STRESS-RELIEVERS,

20:36.969 --> 20:42.041
BUT THEY'RE NOT GONNA
STOP THE PROGRESS
OF THIS DISEASE.

20:42.141 --> 20:44.344
NOT ACCORDING
TO WESTERN MEDICINE.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.679
APRIL,
DID YOU COME TO ME

20:46.779 --> 20:49.749
LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY
TO TELL YOU THAT IT'S OKAY

20:49.849 --> 20:51.818
NOT TO GET TREATMENT?

20:51.918 --> 20:54.253
NO.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.158
DO-- DO YOU SMOKE?

20:59.258 --> 21:00.960
WHAT?

21:01.060 --> 21:03.496
SOCIALLY, A BIT.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.598
THIS ISN'T LUNG CANCER.

21:06.533 --> 21:10.903
WELL, THERE'S AN OLD ADAGE--

21:12.138 --> 21:13.506
A SAYING THAT

21:13.606 --> 21:16.676
THE REASON THAT
SMOKERS DON'T BELIEVE

21:16.776 --> 21:18.678
A CIGARETTE CAN
KILL THEM IS BECAUSE

21:18.778 --> 21:22.081
A CIGARETTE HAS NEVER
KILLED THEM BEFORE.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.884
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

21:26.185 --> 21:28.888
I'M WONDERING
IF YOU REALLY

21:28.988 --> 21:33.326
BELIEVE THAT
YOU HAVE CANCER.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.797
I KNOW
I HAVE CANCER.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.767
YES, BUT DO YOU BELIEVE
WHAT YOU KNOW?

21:43.370 --> 21:46.873
WHAT ELSE DID
THE ONCOLOGIST TELL YOU?

21:53.212 --> 21:54.881
APRIL?

21:54.981 --> 21:57.249
( exhales sharply )

21:57.350 --> 21:59.285
SHE SAID THAT
I WAS AT STAGE THREE

21:59.386 --> 22:01.220
AND I SHOULD START
CHEMO IMMEDIATELY.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.322
- DO YOU TRUST HER?
- NO.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.492
- WHY NOT?
- I JUST DON'T LIKE HER.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.694
COULD THAT POSSIBLY BE

22:07.794 --> 22:11.297
BECAUSE SHE WAS TELLING YOU
THAT YOU DO HAVE CANCER?

22:11.398 --> 22:13.165
I JUST TOLD YOU I WANT

22:13.265 --> 22:14.767
TO LOOK INTO
ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE,

22:14.867 --> 22:17.470
- MAYBE A HOMEOPATH.
- DO YOU SEE ANY PATTERN

22:17.570 --> 22:19.205
BETWEEN GOING
TO DIFFERENT THERAPISTS

22:19.305 --> 22:21.408
AND GOING
TO DIFFERENT DOCTORS?

22:23.710 --> 22:26.913
DID YOU TELL
THE OTHER THERAPIST
ABOUT YOUR DISEASE?

22:27.013 --> 22:28.881
- NO.
- WHY NOT?

22:28.981 --> 22:31.150
BECAUSE I COULD TELL
SHE WASN'T REALLY
INTERESTED IN ME.

22:31.250 --> 22:34.687
- AND HOW COULD YOU TELL THAT?
- SHE TOLD ME THE SAME
STORY TWICE.

22:34.787 --> 22:38.224
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT STORY.

22:38.324 --> 22:41.360
THE MAN WHO NEEDS
ASSISTANCE--

22:41.461 --> 22:43.796
HE REFUSES TO ASK
AND REFUSES TO ASK,

22:43.896 --> 22:46.533
AND WHEN HE FINALLY
HAS NO OTHER CHOICE

22:46.633 --> 22:49.101
HE GOES UP
TO THE COP,

22:49.201 --> 22:51.538
BUT INSTEAD
OF ASKING FOR HELP

22:51.638 --> 22:55.241
HE ASSUMES THE COP IS
GOING TO INSULT HIM,

22:55.341 --> 22:57.644
SO HE INSULTS HIMSELF

22:57.744 --> 22:59.912
BEFORE THE COP HAS
A CHANCE TO SAY A WORD.

23:00.012 --> 23:03.850
I THINK IT'S REALLY
THE STORY OF A MAN

23:03.950 --> 23:06.352
WHO'S UNDERGOING
AN INTENSE INTERNAL CONFLICT,

23:06.453 --> 23:09.021
A MAN WHO HAS
A HARD TIME

23:09.121 --> 23:12.324
TRUSTING OTHER PEOPLE.

23:12.425 --> 23:16.463
- IT WAS JUST A JOKE.
- BUT I'M JUST WONDERING

23:16.563 --> 23:18.831
IF SHE TOLD IT TWICE
FOR A REASON, APRIL.

23:18.931 --> 23:22.902
IS IT POSSIBLE, DO YOU THINK,
THAT SHE REALLY WAS
LISTENING TO YOU?

23:23.002 --> 23:25.337
- SHE WAS A MORON.
- THAT MIGHT BE TRUE,

23:25.438 --> 23:27.339
BUT SHE MAY HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT

23:27.440 --> 23:30.276
IT'S OKAY TO RELY
ON OTHER PEOPLE,

23:30.376 --> 23:34.947
THAT IT'S OKAY
TO ASK FOR HELP.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.916
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
- EVERYBODY AT SOME POINT

23:37.016 --> 23:40.019
IN THEIR LIVES NEEDS HELP,
AND I THINK THAT

23:40.119 --> 23:42.989
- YOU NEED HELP NOW.
- YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
A WORD I'VE SAID.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.257
I THINK THAT YOU NEED
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

23:45.357 --> 23:46.759
THAT TAKES PLACE
OUTSIDE YOUR OWN HEAD.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.995
I THINK THAT YOU NEED
TO TALK TO YOUR ONCOLOGIST.

23:49.095 --> 23:52.264
I THINK YOU NEED TO TELL HER
THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING
ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES.

23:52.364 --> 23:55.301
I THINK YOU NEED
TO ASK HER HOW SHE THINKS
YOU SHOULD PROCEED.

23:55.401 --> 23:58.170
- AND YOU DO NEED
TO TELL YOUR PARENTS.
- JUST STOP IT.

23:58.270 --> 24:02.742
- YOU'RE AT STAGE THREE.
- STOP IT. STOP IT.
STOP IT.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.512
HOW DARE YOU
TELL ME WHAT TO DO?

24:05.612 --> 24:07.647
- YOU DO NOT KNOW ME.
- APRIL.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.549
WHAT, DID YOU FORMULATE
YOUR LITTLE THEORY

24:09.649 --> 24:11.417
AS SOON AS I WALKED IN?
"YOUNG GIRL, CANCER--

24:11.518 --> 24:13.319
THIS IS AN EASY ONE."

24:13.419 --> 24:16.055
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I AM CAPABLE OF.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.824
YOU'RE RIGHT,
I DON'T.

24:17.924 --> 24:19.992
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TELL ME?

24:20.092 --> 24:21.160
YOU KNOW, I--

24:21.260 --> 24:23.830
I HAVE TO GO--
OUR TIME'S UP.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.499
APRIL, I'M SORRY THAT
YOU FELT I WAS TELLING YOU

24:26.599 --> 24:28.367
WHAT TO DO BEFORE
I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW YOU,

24:28.467 --> 24:31.303
BUT I DO THINK THAT
WE SHOULD SCHEDULE
ANOTHER SESSION.

24:31.403 --> 24:34.774
- LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.
- HOW IS FRIDAY--

24:34.874 --> 24:36.709
- FRIDAY AFTERNOON?
- YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY--

24:36.809 --> 24:38.410
I DON'T HAVE
MY SCHEDULE THIS WEEK.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.613
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN
I GET BACK TO THE DORM.

24:40.713 --> 24:43.382
- WHEN DO YOU THINK
THAT WILL BE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

24:43.482 --> 24:47.019
APRIL, THIS TIME
IS VERY CRUCIAL.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.989
- SO I HEAR.
- SO WHAT ABOUT
THE SESSION?

24:50.089 --> 24:52.925
- UH, I'LL CALL YOU, OKAY?
- THANK YOU.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.627
( door closes )

24:57.830 --> 25:00.499
( door closes
in distance )

25:11.778 --> 25:14.714
( classical instrumental
music playing )
