WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:03.268
(silence)

00:03.270 --> 00:06.005
(tapping)

00:08.509 --> 00:11.076
(eerie music)

00:36.170 --> 00:41.206
(speaking foreign language)
(eerie music)

00:52.620 --> 00:56.321
(speaking foreign language)

01:00.294 --> 01:01.527
(soft music)

01:01.529 --> 01:02.461
- [Man] That mountain
came out of nowhere.

01:02.463 --> 01:03.629
- [Man] Shut up dude.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.097
- [Woman] It's not funny.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.398
- [Man] Kim, if it's not funny,

01:06.400 --> 01:07.966
why are you smiling?

01:07.968 --> 01:10.235
- This ain't working.

01:10.237 --> 01:10.903
Okay.

01:10.905 --> 01:13.739
- So, stand up.
- Fin?

01:13.741 --> 01:14.973
- [Man] What are you doing?

01:14.975 --> 01:15.774
- [Phin] Put your arm
around me, come on.

01:15.776 --> 01:16.575
- [Man] Oh Christ.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.709
- [Phin] Stand up now.

01:17.711 --> 01:18.377
On the count of three,
I want you to hop.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.044
One, two, three.

01:19.046 --> 01:19.878
Okay.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.246
Okay.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.981
Watch the leg.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.650
(soft music)

01:24.652 --> 01:25.551
- Okay.

01:26.353 --> 01:27.352
Alright.

01:27.354 --> 01:28.253
Thanks.

01:30.024 --> 01:31.423
- Thanks, babe.
- Yeah.

01:31.859 --> 01:32.524
Here's good.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.659
- Yeah, oh, let me help.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.594
- Alright, there we go.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.929
(sighs)

01:40.334 --> 01:41.233
- Home sweet home.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.635
Guys, I'm sorry about

01:43.637 --> 01:44.636
all this.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.871
It's a real trip.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.223
- [Phin] It's alright man.

01:47.224 --> 01:48.574
Now we get to make fun of you
for the rest of your life.

01:48.576 --> 01:49.842
- Yeah.

01:49.844 --> 01:50.709
Hey, where's that
bottle of wine?

01:50.711 --> 01:52.277
- No more vicodin for this guy.

01:52.279 --> 01:55.814
It's a life giving bottle.

01:56.750 --> 01:57.816
- Really at it's best, I'm sure.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.184
- It's so sweet.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.587
Phin said the
sweetest thing today.

02:01.589 --> 02:04.356
We were making love,
you remember this?

02:04.358 --> 02:05.257
- Nah.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.459
- He had his face in the pillow

02:07.461 --> 02:08.527
and he turns to me and he goes,

02:08.529 --> 02:10.095
you know George,

02:10.097 --> 02:13.065
I just thought
how sweet it was--

02:13.067 --> 02:15.834
(laughter)

02:15.836 --> 02:16.735
- Okay,

02:17.905 --> 02:19.638
everybody clear their minds.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.873
- If I get like a
huge boner right now,

02:20.875 --> 02:23.675
should I just suppress it
or let it flow?

02:23.677 --> 02:24.943
(laughter)

02:24.945 --> 02:26.411
- It's not gonna work
if you're like this.

02:26.413 --> 02:29.815
Everybody has to focus on shit
or it's not gonna happen.

02:29.817 --> 02:30.849
- I'm sorry.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.167
I'm sorry.

02:32.168 --> 02:33.484
It's just so fucking
romantic in here right now.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.221
You don't really believe
in this shit, do you?

02:36.223 --> 02:38.957
- I played it three
times with my cousin.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.225
It worked like twice.

02:40.227 --> 02:41.260
- What happened?

02:41.262 --> 02:42.661
- I don't want,

02:42.663 --> 02:45.230
I don't want to talk about it.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.367
- Come on.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.568
- It's probably

02:49.570 --> 02:50.769
not even freaky anyways.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.237
Probably lamest thing
I've ever heard.

02:52.239 --> 02:52.971
- You know what,

02:52.973 --> 02:54.273
I don't even want to hear it.

02:54.274 --> 02:55.574
I'm sure it's boring as shit.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.344
- If I tell you guys,

02:59.346 --> 03:01.046
you'll totally chicken out.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.014
- Go ahead.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.051
- I was staying with my
cousin Becca in New York.

03:06.053 --> 03:09.087
And we hang out every night,

03:09.089 --> 03:10.756
had friends over and stuff.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.457
And there was this
one guy, Davy,

03:12.459 --> 03:14.459
that I made out with
a couple of times.

03:14.461 --> 03:15.861
But by this point,

03:15.863 --> 03:17.996
he was freaking me out.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.599
He comes over
really early and

03:20.601 --> 03:22.367
we don't know what
to do with him.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.369
And she comes up with
a brilliant idea of

03:24.371 --> 03:28.774
let's do a bunch of shots
and play Ouija.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.344
The weird thing was that

03:32.346 --> 03:35.581
every time Davy
touched the planchet.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.382
- Wait, what's a planchet?

03:37.384 --> 03:38.884
- This.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.452
- Oh.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.187
Okay, go on.

03:42.189 --> 03:44.122
- And it just
starts freaking out.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.658
And then it starts
flying to the nine,

03:46.660 --> 03:48.627
to the one,

03:48.629 --> 03:49.761
to the five

03:49.763 --> 03:50.996
over and over again.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.164
Nine, one, five.

03:52.166 --> 03:55.133
Becca goes and she
starts fixing her makeup

03:55.135 --> 03:56.768
and the buzzer rings.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.973
It's time to go so I
let Becca know this and

04:00.975 --> 04:04.109
when she walks out of her room,

04:06.180 --> 04:07.813
she is as white as a ghost.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.383
And I shit you not,

04:11.385 --> 04:12.784
it is 9:15.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.654
- Oh my god, I just
got the chills.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.022
Look at my arms.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.590
- Okay, I have the
strangest suspicion

04:18.592 --> 04:20.125
that I've actually
heard this story before.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.727
- It's weird is people always

04:21.729 --> 04:25.063
ignore the first part
of the coincidence.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.665
They focus on the second part.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.699
- Okay, what,

04:27.701 --> 04:29.167
what he's talking about?

04:29.169 --> 04:30.435
- What time were your
friends supposed to show?

04:30.437 --> 04:32.037
When you were playing the game,

04:32.039 --> 04:33.572
what time were they supposed
to show to your house?

04:33.574 --> 04:36.441
- Maybe around nine o'clock
we were going out, but

04:36.443 --> 04:38.243
- [George] Right, exactly.
- it has nothing to do with.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.145
- They got their what, at 9:15.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.113
- Oh.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.147
- 15 minutes late.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.382
If you were to put money down,

04:43.384 --> 04:45.384
what time somebody
was gonna show,

04:45.386 --> 04:47.619
if they were supposed
to be there at nine,

04:47.621 --> 04:49.755
you would say 9:15.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.056
- Dude, you're a buzzkill.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.457
- And as for the first part,

04:52.459 --> 04:55.527
you guys subconsciously
put your focus

04:55.529 --> 04:57.462
on the nine, one, five.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.930
Nine, one, five,

04:58.932 --> 05:01.233
because you knew
something different

05:01.235 --> 05:03.435
was gonna happen.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.469
- Is that your theory?

05:04.471 --> 05:05.370
- Uh huh.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.474
- It's not what happened.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.610
- I'm starting to
like this idea.

05:11.612 --> 05:12.744
I mean come on,

05:12.746 --> 05:13.979
my grandma went batshit
before she died,

05:13.981 --> 05:15.213
like hid all of her
jewelry and shit.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.948
She seriously thought
like the communists

05:16.950 --> 05:18.183
were coming to get her.

05:18.185 --> 05:18.984
I mean come on, I'm
in for the money.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.352
Let's fucking do this.

05:20.354 --> 05:21.353
- Okay.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.354
- [Kim] Okay.

05:22.356 --> 05:26.892
- You sure?
- Well, yeah.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.460
- Okay.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.095
Here we go.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.830
- Okay, let's do it.

05:32.933 --> 05:33.999
- Everybody,

05:34.902 --> 05:36.368
clear your heads.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.604
- Big money, let's go.

05:39.606 --> 05:40.939
- Now just

05:40.941 --> 05:42.074
put one of your hands

05:42.076 --> 05:43.141
on the board

05:44.011 --> 05:45.577
really lightly and

05:49.416 --> 05:50.315
hello.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.319
Is there anyone out there?

05:54.321 --> 05:55.654
- [Phin] Grandma,
where's your necklace?

05:57.591 --> 06:00.992
- Is there anyone that
wants to communicate?

06:00.994 --> 06:04.463
(slow suspenseful music)

06:05.532 --> 06:06.565
- This is bullshit.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.466
- Shh.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.735
- Jesus Christ.

06:11.338 --> 06:12.571
I'm nervous, I'm sorry.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.573
- It's okay.
It's supposed to move.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.041
There's, um...

06:16.043 --> 06:17.876
there's definitely an energy.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.446
- Who was that?

06:21.448 --> 06:23.682
Was that you, Phin?

06:23.684 --> 06:24.716
- Phin, you moved it.
- [George] You moved it.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.550
(group murmurs)

06:25.552 --> 06:27.452
- (laughs) I swear.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.030
- [George] Who's S-R?

06:39.032 --> 06:40.365
Anybody know an S-R,

06:40.367 --> 06:41.366
R-S?

06:41.368 --> 06:43.201
- My grandma.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.570
- [George] No, he's--

06:45.572 --> 06:47.072
- [Olivia] Jesus.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.074
- You met her.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.243
She made you those socks.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.080
- Oh my god.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.348
- I think we need
to clear the board.

06:56.350 --> 06:57.749
- It's spelling hash.

06:57.751 --> 06:58.583
- No, no, no, it's

06:58.585 --> 06:59.418
Shala--

06:59.420 --> 07:00.252
- [Kim] George don't.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.019
- What.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.087
Shala--

07:02.089 --> 07:03.288
- Yeah, done.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.289
- No, no, hold up.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.590
Hold up. Hold up.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.392
- No, dude, you're on
your own on this one.

07:07.394 --> 07:10.796
(slow suspenseful music)

07:14.568 --> 07:15.467
Phin.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.337
(eerie music)

07:29.516 --> 07:30.949
Phin.
- [Olivia] Phin.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.518
(eerie music)

07:37.991 --> 07:39.241
- [George] Phin.

07:39.242 --> 07:40.492
- Oh my god, Phin.
That's not funny.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.426
Come on.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.344
- He's had a lot to drink.

07:42.345 --> 07:43.261
- [Kim] Something
happened to him, Phin.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.196
- Phin.

07:44.198 --> 07:44.963
Phin stop dicking around.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.164
- Hey.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.265
- Babe, will you
get rid of the game?

07:47.267 --> 07:48.500
- Fuck yeah.

07:48.502 --> 07:49.768
- Olivia, just put on a movie.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.002
A funny movie.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.504
Something to clear
the air, please.

07:52.506 --> 07:53.338
- Okay.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.172
- [George] Yeah, okay.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.040
- Yeah, a funny movie.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.441
- [George] Phin.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.311
- [Olivia] Phin.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.745
- [Kim] Jesus.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.147
- Wake up Phin.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.248
- [George] Phineas.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.550
(laughter)

08:06.620 --> 08:08.687
- [Olivia] That's wrong.

08:13.093 --> 08:13.992
- Hey.

08:15.062 --> 08:18.763
Since when did you
start smoking in bed?

08:18.765 --> 08:20.799
- Since I can't
walk to the porch.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.400
- Well then maybe
you should quit.

08:22.402 --> 08:23.702
- I can try it.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.138
Yeah.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.575
- She's in there with him.

08:30.577 --> 08:31.710
- Why, he fell asleep.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.578
- While I was
getting you situated,

08:33.580 --> 08:36.515
she took him into his room
and I heard them laughing.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.416
I think she likes him.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.388
- What? It's exciting.
- You're right, it is.

08:45.459 --> 08:46.858
How you doing?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.026
Still scared?

08:49.429 --> 08:51.029
- Scared?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.497
No.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.399
I mean it was
really, really weird.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.034
- Yeah, I know.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.202
I don't know.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.237
- But hey,

09:00.607 --> 09:02.807
you know what was
super, super sexy?

09:02.809 --> 09:04.543
When Phin passed out,

09:04.545 --> 09:07.178
and everybody freaked
out and you were like

09:07.180 --> 09:08.647
"Kimmy, put the game away.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.549
"Olivia, put a funny movie on."

09:10.551 --> 09:11.683
- Put Top Secret on.

09:11.685 --> 09:12.951
- Yeah.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.185
- Yeah.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.020
- I bet you're gonna
make regional manager

09:15.022 --> 09:16.588
in like five years.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.489
- Kim.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.292
Come on, don't say that.

09:20.294 --> 09:21.526
Don't ever say that.

09:21.528 --> 09:24.296
- No, since when did
you get so bossy?

09:24.298 --> 09:28.333
- I'm not bossy, I'm just
crabby, that's all.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.002
- You're Mr. Crabby.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.238
(kisses)

09:34.741 --> 09:35.640
- Kimmy.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.542
- What?

09:37.544 --> 09:39.377
You don't have the do anything.

09:39.379 --> 09:40.745
- I'm just

09:40.747 --> 09:42.113
tired.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.882
- Don't worry.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.884
I will be very,

09:45.886 --> 09:46.718
very

09:46.720 --> 09:47.619
gentle.

09:48.622 --> 09:51.189
- I mean it's good, it's okay.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.259
- Oh, come on.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.260
- Babe.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.494
- Kai said

09:56.496 --> 09:58.964
I would have amazing
orgasms this week.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.298
- Oh wow, you know what,

10:00.300 --> 10:02.667
then why don't you go give Kai,

10:02.669 --> 10:04.069
the psychic,

10:04.071 --> 10:05.804
a booty call because

10:07.474 --> 10:08.607
I'm Mr. Gimp

10:08.609 --> 10:10.041
and I'm going to sleep.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.176
- Fine.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.545
Bite off my head
because I want to do it.

10:13.547 --> 10:15.513
- Come here, come here, just

10:15.515 --> 10:16.748
- No.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.283
- Poo bear, come here.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.184
I'm sorry.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.419
Okay.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.155
Come here.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.125
There.

10:28.362 --> 10:29.260
Hey.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.597
(eerie music)

10:34.468 --> 10:36.835
(inaudible)

10:36.837 --> 10:39.371
(eerie music)

10:56.323 --> 10:57.155
(knock on the door)

10:57.157 --> 10:58.123
- George.

10:58.125 --> 10:58.957
- Huh?
- Wake up.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.025
(knock on the door)

11:00.027 --> 11:00.925
Wake up.

11:00.927 --> 11:01.926
- Okay.

11:01.928 --> 11:02.927
- What?

11:02.928 --> 11:03.927
- What the fuck?
- What's going on?

11:03.930 --> 11:05.964
(knocking)
- Come in, come in.

11:05.966 --> 11:06.965
- Kimmy, I'm sorry.

11:06.967 --> 11:07.966
Can I have a ride home?

11:07.968 --> 11:10.101
- Okay, what happened?

11:10.103 --> 11:11.469
- I just need a ride
home, please, okay?

11:11.471 --> 11:12.971
Thanks.

11:12.973 --> 11:13.872
- Alright.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.242
- What the fuck did he do?

11:17.244 --> 11:18.243
- I don't know.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.712
(soft music)

11:25.385 --> 11:26.451
- Hey.
- I'm so sorry.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.653
- No, no, no, listen,

11:28.654 --> 11:30.854
I don't know what's going on,
but I am way too nervy to drive.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.390
So why don't you
just take my car.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.625
I'll get it from you tomorrow.

11:33.627 --> 11:34.659
- Thank you so much.

11:34.661 --> 11:35.927
I just, I don't know

11:35.929 --> 11:37.162
if he's trying to
be funny or what,

11:37.164 --> 11:38.563
but I just need to
get out of here.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.799
I need to get to
my dogs.

11:40.801 --> 11:41.833
I just gotta go.

11:41.835 --> 11:42.834
- Okay. Okay.

11:42.836 --> 11:46.071
I know he's not
really himself tonight.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.305
Will you just text
me when you get home?

11:47.307 --> 11:48.740
- Call me, I don't care.
- Yeah.

11:48.742 --> 11:49.874
You promise?

11:49.876 --> 11:51.109
- Okay. Thank you.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.177
- You're welcome.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.614
(slow suspenseful music)

12:13.433 --> 12:15.900
(soft music)

12:31.384 --> 12:32.417
- Hey, cock state,

12:32.419 --> 12:34.319
wake up.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.955
(guitar strums)

12:38.492 --> 12:40.058
It's like summer break.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.426
- [George] What?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.695
- I hope you don't mind,
I borrowed one of your pills.

12:43.697 --> 12:45.029
- Oh, great.

12:45.031 --> 12:45.864
Fantastic.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.082
- Yeah, dude.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.299
This is awesome.
You got all this time off.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.200
You getting paid
for this, right?

12:49.202 --> 12:50.502
Like it's a free vacation?

12:50.504 --> 12:51.469
- I don't know man.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.737
I haven't figured it out yet.

12:52.739 --> 12:53.805
- Yeah well, it's like
one o'clock already.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.140
You slept later than me today.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.441
- Yeah, well I'm tired.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.176
- You need anything?

12:58.178 --> 13:00.979
Want some food or
you want to move into the

13:00.981 --> 13:02.013
living room?

13:02.015 --> 13:03.248
- No, not yet.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.283
What did you do
last night, Phin?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.652
- What didn't I do?

13:07.654 --> 13:09.220
I did all sorts of stuff
with that girl last night.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.221
- No, I mean

13:10.223 --> 13:11.222
after that.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.791
- Oh.

13:12.793 --> 13:13.825
I went to bed.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.126
Woke up this morning,

13:15.128 --> 13:16.127
took a shower,

13:16.129 --> 13:17.362
smoked a bowl and came in here.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.730
- No, I mean what did
you do to Olivia, Phin?

13:18.732 --> 13:20.365
- Besides eating her pink taco,

13:20.367 --> 13:21.599
I didn't do shit.

13:21.601 --> 13:22.734
- Well she woke up in
the middle of the night

13:22.736 --> 13:23.935
freaked out,

13:23.937 --> 13:24.936
screaming.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.171
Okay, you did something to her.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.406
- Maybe I fucking
drooled on her.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.441
I don't know.
- Dammit Phin,

13:30.443 --> 13:31.609
you really spooked her man.

13:31.611 --> 13:32.811
- What do you want me to say?

13:32.813 --> 13:34.579
I mean I don't
remember anything.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.214
- You fucked up.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.615
(phone ringing)

13:37.617 --> 13:38.616
- What is that?

13:38.618 --> 13:40.451
- It's Kim calling me.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.519
Just shut up.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.888
- Big girlfriend.

13:43.890 --> 13:44.923
- Shut up.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.124
Stop.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.158
- [Phin] Big girlfriend
in the fucking sky.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.159
- Hey babe.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.028
Hi honey.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.229
You have everything you need?

13:51.231 --> 13:52.197
- Yeah, I'm just trying
to finally wake up.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.398
- Okay, well,

13:53.400 --> 13:54.666
just relax babe.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.567
I'm gonna try to get
out of here early

13:55.569 --> 13:56.634
and get over to you.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.636
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.671
- Okay.

13:59.673 --> 14:00.705
- Oh, too rough.

14:00.707 --> 14:01.873
- Oh, come on guys.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.308
What if Dan saw?

14:03.310 --> 14:05.210
- I gotta go.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.110
- Idiots.

14:07.447 --> 14:08.680
- God, she's already pissy
for last night, Phin.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.882
Why do you gotta
push all the time?

14:10.884 --> 14:12.584
- Man, your grumpy
when you're injured.

14:12.586 --> 14:13.852
You're like an old man.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.186
- I'm three months
younger than you,

14:15.188 --> 14:16.087
dick hole.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.591
- Hold on, I got something
that'll make you feel better.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.263
(lighter flicks)

14:31.738 --> 14:32.871
- No.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.005
- [Phin] Dig in.
- No, it's too early for that.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.473
- Come on man, you
got a busted leg.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.774
It's medicine, it'll
make you feel better.

14:36.776 --> 14:37.976
- Okay.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.144
- Don't take it
like a puss either.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.045
Smoke it.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.316
I'll write you a little
song while we're in here.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.217
- Yep.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.953
- [Phin] Alright.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.878
- Hey guys.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.113
I have Chinese

15:16.950 --> 15:17.849
food.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.493
Gross.

16:14.708 --> 16:15.606
Hey.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.409
- Hey.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.645
- I organized your plates.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.781
- Organized my plates?

16:26.853 --> 16:28.252
Thanks.

16:28.254 --> 16:29.854
Thank you.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.155
- Is he asleep?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.792
- Yeah, I think so.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.129
- So, um,

16:40.900 --> 16:42.467
Dan asked me today

16:43.870 --> 16:48.406
if I wanted to go to this
conference thing in Vegas.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.142
But the thing is I would
have to leave on Thursday

16:51.144 --> 16:54.345
and I told him that I
would ask you first,

16:54.347 --> 16:57.415
and get back to him tomorrow.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.416
- Yeah, no.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.885
You should go.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.322
You should go.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.690
You wanted to go.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.426
- Yeah, but that was
before you got hurt.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.394
- I'm fine.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.398
Phin doesn't do anything.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.299
He'll take care of me.

17:16.703 --> 17:17.602
I'm fine.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.505
- [Kim] Are you sure?

17:20.507 --> 17:21.973
- Uh huh.

17:21.975 --> 17:23.408
- Okay, because Dan
said that this would be

17:23.410 --> 17:25.143
a great opportunity
to get in good

17:25.145 --> 17:26.377
with Fielding,

17:26.379 --> 17:27.311
and you know that I've
been trying to get--

17:27.313 --> 17:28.413
- I totally get it.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.647
Fielding, he's,

17:29.649 --> 17:30.615
it's great.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.185
It's great.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.454
It's the greatest thing ever.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.655
- Okay.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.457
I knew you'd be
wonderful about it.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.358
Now,

17:41.928 --> 17:44.762
one more favor?

17:44.998 --> 17:45.897
- Uh huh.

17:48.935 --> 17:49.834
- Let me

17:50.770 --> 17:52.670
take you

17:52.806 --> 17:54.138
into your room.

17:56.342 --> 17:59.077
And let me have my way with you.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.681
Cause you owe me
from last night.

18:03.683 --> 18:04.582
- I do.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.285
But I'm scared.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.154
- [Kim] You should be.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.495
(eerie music)

18:24.337 --> 18:26.104
I have to go to the bathroom.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.338
- [George] No.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.308
- Stop it you lunatic.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.611
I have to pee.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.779
- [George] Hurry up woman.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.147
- Alright,

18:36.149 --> 18:37.415
you just watch out.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.485
- [George] I'm
watching that behind.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.276
(eerie music)

19:07.947 --> 19:08.846
- George?

19:18.892 --> 19:20.158
Hello?

19:20.160 --> 19:22.727
(eerie music)

19:30.036 --> 19:30.935
Hello?

19:40.980 --> 19:42.413
(screams)

19:42.415 --> 19:43.681
George, George.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.716
George, oh my god.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.084
Does he think he's being funny?

19:47.086 --> 19:48.786
Phin is fucking crazy.

19:48.788 --> 19:49.987
- Kim, Kim,

19:49.989 --> 19:51.189
go to back to bed.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.690
Kim, go back to bed.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.791
- Do something.

19:53.793 --> 19:54.992
- Okay.

19:54.994 --> 19:55.993
- Okay.

19:55.995 --> 19:56.994
- Okay.

19:56.996 --> 19:57.995
- I'll call you if I need you.

19:57.997 --> 19:58.996
Go back to bed.

19:58.998 --> 19:59.897
Okay.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.205
Hey.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.343
Phineas,

20:19.285 --> 20:20.184
hey.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.221
Hey man.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.229
What the fuck?

20:36.269 --> 20:37.735
I got this fucking
thing in my hand,

20:37.737 --> 20:39.570
I'm gonna throw it
at your goddamn face,

20:39.572 --> 20:40.605
now wake up.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.473
One.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.908
Two.

20:43.910 --> 20:44.775
Phin.

20:54.153 --> 20:55.019
Phinny.

20:57.557 --> 21:00.491
- Dude, turn the
fucking light off.

21:00.493 --> 21:01.325
Christ.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.496
- Okay.

21:06.699 --> 21:07.598
Okay, man.

21:19.512 --> 21:22.013
(soft music)

21:23.983 --> 21:26.984
(speaking foreign language)

21:26.986 --> 21:28.286
- Liar, liar, liar.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.754
(speaking foreign language)

21:29.756 --> 21:31.155
Liar.

21:31.157 --> 21:32.056
Liar.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.160
(soft music)

21:38.131 --> 21:39.030
Liar.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.600
(soft music)

22:04.891 --> 22:05.890
- [Phin] Boo.

22:05.892 --> 22:06.924
- Oh fuck me man.

22:06.926 --> 22:07.925
What the fuck's wrong with you?

22:07.927 --> 22:10.261
(laughter)

22:13.433 --> 22:15.166
It's not funny man.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.401
- [Phin] That was awesome.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.905
- No, it's not awesome.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.444
You know what
dude, first of all,

22:26.446 --> 22:28.612
okay, you scared the shit
out of Kim last night.

22:28.614 --> 22:30.648
I mean whatever you're doing,

22:30.650 --> 22:31.682
sleepwalking,

22:31.684 --> 22:32.983
it's fucking weird.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.385
It's just weird.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.088
- Maybe that's why I
woke up in the tub.

22:37.090 --> 22:38.589
- What have you been on man?

22:38.591 --> 22:39.590
Seriously,

22:39.592 --> 22:41.225
besides pot, booze,

22:41.227 --> 22:42.460
mushrooms,

22:42.462 --> 22:43.494
ecstasy,

22:43.496 --> 22:44.729
what?

22:44.731 --> 22:46.497
- No, I did have this
crazy ass dream though.

22:46.499 --> 22:49.767
I was like sitting
there and my mom,

22:49.769 --> 22:51.802
she left me with my nanny,

22:51.804 --> 22:53.237
which is kind of weird

22:53.239 --> 22:54.605
cause I never had a nanny.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.673
- Stop, Phin, stop.

22:55.675 --> 22:56.874
Just first of all,

22:56.876 --> 22:57.742
stop fucking saying
nanny, please.

22:57.744 --> 22:58.609
- Okay.

22:59.312 --> 23:00.478
So anyway nanny is sitting there

23:00.480 --> 23:01.479
nannying the shit out of me

23:01.481 --> 23:02.980
in nannyland.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.014
She falls asleep,

23:04.016 --> 23:05.316
and I look up and
there's this like

23:05.318 --> 23:06.517
white bird sitting
on the windowsill.

23:06.519 --> 23:07.718
It's got something like
tied around its foot.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.954
So I go to try to
figure out what it is.

23:09.956 --> 23:12.356
And I'm sitting there,
and I follow it out,

23:12.358 --> 23:14.158
and it leads me to
this old theater.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.060
And I see my mom walking in.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.461
I'm like, oh wow.

23:17.463 --> 23:19.864
So I sit there and
I'm waiting for her.

23:19.866 --> 23:22.833
And all I'm doing is I
keep writing the word fly

23:22.835 --> 23:26.203
in the dirt over and
over and over again.

23:26.205 --> 23:27.605
- Wow, Phin.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.306
That's great, that's
fucking exciting.

23:29.308 --> 23:30.808
- I see my mom walk out

23:30.810 --> 23:31.942
and she's with some dude.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.310
And this guy's,

23:33.312 --> 23:34.545
I mean he's not my dad.

23:34.547 --> 23:35.413
I mean it's just like
some smooth looking

23:35.415 --> 23:36.580
son of a bitch.

23:36.582 --> 23:37.982
So I'm like pissed.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.618
And I get home and I
get to the kitchen.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.621
My parents are like going at it,

23:43.623 --> 23:44.855
like fighting.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.190
And my mom turns
to me and she like

23:46.192 --> 23:47.224
where the hell have you been.

23:47.226 --> 23:48.659
And I get so mad,

23:48.661 --> 23:50.227
like I just get this
overwhelming feeling.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.529
I look over and there's
this pair of scissors

23:51.531 --> 23:52.763
sitting on the table.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.831
I get so mad I like
grab the scissors

23:53.833 --> 23:55.399
and go right at her.

23:55.401 --> 23:56.901
And all of a sudden,

23:56.903 --> 23:58.736
there's this like crazy burst
of like electrical energy.

23:58.738 --> 24:01.772
And everything goes fucking red.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.240
- That is pretty fucked up.

24:03.242 --> 24:04.308
- Thank you.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.310
That's why I had to tell you.

24:06.312 --> 24:07.278
- Wow, thanks.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.512
- You're welcome.

24:08.514 --> 24:09.847
- What the fuck
have you been on?

24:09.849 --> 24:10.948
- Fuck you dude,

24:10.950 --> 24:11.949
I'm not on,

24:11.951 --> 24:12.983
weed.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.218
Okay.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.019
It's the same shit I
get from the pharmacy

24:15.021 --> 24:16.053
every week.

24:16.055 --> 24:17.054
- That's it?

24:17.056 --> 24:17.988
- [Phin] That's it.

24:17.990 --> 24:18.722
- Do me a favor, 24 hours,

24:18.724 --> 24:19.890
don't do it.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.225
Let's just see what happens.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.293
- If I don't smoke weed,

24:22.295 --> 24:23.294
I can't sleep.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.395
- Perfect.

24:24.397 --> 24:25.830
That's great.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.364
Because it's when you're
sleeping we have the problem.

24:27.366 --> 24:30.668
It took me three hours to
calm Kim down last night.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.537
She seriously thinking
about not going

24:33.539 --> 24:35.573
to the conference in Vegas.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.141
And I know you don't
want her to not,

24:37.143 --> 24:38.809
just

24:38.811 --> 24:40.644
stop.

24:40.646 --> 24:41.412
Okay.

24:42.782 --> 24:43.681
24 hours.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.183
Just one night.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.218
- Fine.

24:47.220 --> 24:48.118
Whatever.

25:11.077 --> 25:11.976
Thanks.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.820
The yard looks good.

25:25.491 --> 25:27.491
- [Gardner] How's life?

25:28.628 --> 25:32.429
- Oh, I've been having
strange dreams lately.

25:32.431 --> 25:33.931
- [Gardner] Dreams?

25:33.933 --> 25:35.533
It's nice to be young.

25:35.535 --> 25:36.433
- Yeah.

25:39.272 --> 25:40.170
Hey,

25:41.240 --> 25:42.239
do you ever think
about having just like

25:42.241 --> 25:43.507
a couple people over tonight

25:43.509 --> 25:45.309
just for some drinks?

25:48.347 --> 25:50.581
- Not too loud on the base.

25:50.583 --> 25:51.615
- Oh no, not at all.

25:51.617 --> 25:52.650
Yeah.

25:52.652 --> 25:53.884
We'll totally take care of that.

25:53.886 --> 25:54.752
I'm just gonna go
grab some stuff.

25:54.754 --> 25:55.920
But let me know if we

25:55.922 --> 25:56.954
get too loud.

25:56.956 --> 25:57.988
I'll see you later.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.323
Thanks again for the light.

25:59.325 --> 26:00.491
See ya.

26:00.493 --> 26:01.759
- Now, come on.

26:04.297 --> 26:06.797
(soft music)

26:26.686 --> 26:28.085
- Thank you God.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.855
(soft music)

26:37.096 --> 26:38.262
Babe, fuck.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.496
Babe get up.

26:39.498 --> 26:40.531
Get up.

26:40.533 --> 26:41.966
You're late, you're late.

26:41.968 --> 26:42.866
Get up.

26:42.868 --> 26:43.701
- What time is it?

26:43.703 --> 26:44.535
- It's 9:30.

26:44.537 --> 26:45.369
- Oh shit.

26:45.371 --> 26:46.537
Are you serious?

26:46.539 --> 26:47.471
- Yeah, come on.

26:47.473 --> 26:48.505
- Oh my god, I told Joelle

26:48.507 --> 26:50.174
I would meet her at 9:30.

26:50.176 --> 26:51.408
- Shit.

26:51.410 --> 26:52.509
- She's gonna drive
me to the airport.

26:52.511 --> 26:53.611
I have to be there super early.

26:53.613 --> 26:54.945
You know Dan wants us there

26:54.947 --> 26:55.946
by five.

26:55.948 --> 26:56.780
It's ridiculous.

26:56.782 --> 26:57.715
Where's my phone?

26:57.717 --> 26:58.449
- [George] It's right here.

26:58.451 --> 26:59.283
- Where?

26:59.285 --> 27:00.217
Thank you.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.619
What's with all the music?

27:01.621 --> 27:02.886
- It's Phin.

27:02.888 --> 27:03.787
I told him he could have
some people over, okay.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.322
- Okay, why?

27:05.324 --> 27:06.390
To celebrate my leaving?

27:06.392 --> 27:07.891
- No, no,

27:07.893 --> 27:09.360
because I asked him not
to smoke pot for 24 hours

27:09.362 --> 27:10.828
to see if that works.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.496
It's sort of a no pot

27:12.498 --> 27:14.031
for a party exchange.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.032
- Okay,

27:15.034 --> 27:16.066
way to be proactive.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.334
- Are you kidding?

27:17.336 --> 27:19.336
Getting Phin not to
smoke for 24 hours.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.738
It's a fete in itself.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.739
Amazing.

27:21.741 --> 27:22.940
- Yeah, amazing.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.441
You know, just make sure
that he sees someone

27:24.443 --> 27:27.011
because there was something
seriously wrong with him.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.278
- Okay I get it.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.513
- I mean if I have
to come back here

27:29.515 --> 27:30.180
after a five day
business trip, I--

27:30.182 --> 27:30.881
- I understand.

27:30.883 --> 27:31.548
I got it, I got it.

27:31.550 --> 27:32.716
- Okay.

27:32.718 --> 27:33.550
- Okay?

27:33.552 --> 27:34.385
- I have to go.

27:34.387 --> 27:35.319
- Now come back here.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.887
- No, no, you're freezing.

27:36.889 --> 27:38.155
No.

27:38.157 --> 27:38.989
- Please, one more.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.057
- I have to go.
I'm already late.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.533
- Okay, George, here.

27:49.535 --> 27:52.703
I'm going to rock your balls
and cock off completely

27:52.705 --> 27:54.038
out of your pants.

27:54.040 --> 27:54.872
Here.

27:54.874 --> 27:55.706
Get ready for greatness.

27:55.708 --> 27:56.974
- Okay, here we go.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.742
- Football's coming
at your fat fingers.

27:58.744 --> 27:59.643
- Oh.

28:01.814 --> 28:02.646
Fuck.

28:02.648 --> 28:03.580
That was good man.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.215
That was actually really good.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.084
- Pretty good.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.952
We don't even have football.

28:08.954 --> 28:10.654
- Good job, Dre.

28:10.656 --> 28:12.289
I need to ask you one question.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.557
- I'll ask you a question.

28:13.559 --> 28:16.927
George, where are the
fucking pretzels, huh?

28:16.929 --> 28:18.028
I'm pretzel less.

28:18.030 --> 28:18.696
- But can I ask you a
question real quick?

28:18.698 --> 28:19.530
- Okay.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.633
- Do you know anything about

28:22.635 --> 28:23.734
sleepwalking?

28:23.736 --> 28:24.768
- Sleepwalking, yeah.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.036
My sister, Mona,

28:26.038 --> 28:27.404
used to sleepwalk
when we were kids.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.606
She would stand at the foots

28:29.608 --> 28:31.208
of the bunk beds here

28:31.210 --> 28:34.712
and just scare all
the shits out of them.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.548
I'm really hungry, George.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.049
Like I could eat the
whole fucking fat buffalo.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.350
- But when she was,

28:40.352 --> 28:41.819
did she ever look
into your eyes,

28:41.821 --> 28:44.154
you know what I mean,

28:44.156 --> 28:46.290
when she was
sleeping, did she ever

28:46.292 --> 28:48.225
look right into your eyes?

28:48.227 --> 28:49.226
- No, no, look

28:49.228 --> 28:50.260
if you're asleep,

28:50.262 --> 28:51.628
there's no

28:51.630 --> 28:53.263
looking.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.165
You're look like this.

28:57.303 --> 28:58.202
You know.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.304
- [George] She's like that?

29:00.306 --> 29:01.238
- Yeah.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.239
There's no looking.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.975
You're sleeping and not looking.

29:06.378 --> 29:07.745
- Oh.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.313
Yeah that's weird.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.583
What the fuck?

29:12.585 --> 29:15.152
- [Phin] Hey, you
pussies come inside.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.887
The girls want to
give us manicures.

29:16.889 --> 29:17.921
- Yeah.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.123
Uno memento.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.458
(laughter)

29:23.295 --> 29:25.763
(soft music)

30:17.950 --> 30:19.116
Oh fuck Phin.

30:20.186 --> 30:22.152
(laughter)

30:22.154 --> 30:23.520
One night.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.222
- George, wait.

30:25.224 --> 30:26.123
Oh shit.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.959
Hold on, I'll be back.

30:29.895 --> 30:30.961
George wait.
- [George] Unbelievable.

30:30.963 --> 30:33.163
- George, hey, come on man look,

30:33.165 --> 30:34.965
okay, I'm not smoking my weed.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.200
This is her weed.

30:36.202 --> 30:37.868
I smoked her weed, that's it.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.369
- It's not the point Phin.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.004
The point is I'm
trying to help you.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.272
So you throw parties,

30:42.274 --> 30:43.540
screw up my last night with Kim,

30:43.542 --> 30:45.309
and you go ahead and
fucking smoke anyways.

30:45.311 --> 30:46.910
- Dude, look,

30:46.912 --> 30:48.412
I have a little insomnia, okay.

30:48.414 --> 30:49.980
Who cares.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.215
- Why would you care, Phin?

30:51.217 --> 30:53.317
- Alright, look, I'm sorry okay.

30:53.319 --> 30:54.685
I got drunk.

30:54.687 --> 30:56.320
I made a bad decision, alright.

30:56.322 --> 30:57.621
- Yeah, I'm sorry too.

30:57.623 --> 30:58.822
I'm sorry for giving a fuck.

30:58.824 --> 30:59.957
- Dude, don't
fucking be like that.

30:59.959 --> 31:00.891
- No.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.159
You're on your own now pal.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.627
- You know you actually
used to be fucking fun.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.262
You remember those days.

31:05.264 --> 31:06.463
- [George] How about
that for fun, Phin?

31:06.465 --> 31:07.464
- You're a fucking
prick, you know that.

31:07.466 --> 31:08.465
- I'm going to bed.

31:08.467 --> 31:09.766
Close the door.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.341
Hey babe, Vegas.

31:17.343 --> 31:18.876
You got there okay?

31:18.878 --> 31:20.177
How was the flight?

31:20.179 --> 31:21.278
- What's under your nails?

31:21.280 --> 31:22.279
- Nothing?

31:22.281 --> 31:23.347
What's that?

31:23.349 --> 31:25.182
- Look, okay.

31:25.184 --> 31:26.416
I know we haven't discussed it

31:26.418 --> 31:27.718
because something
always comes up,

31:27.720 --> 31:29.286
but have you given
any consideration

31:29.288 --> 31:30.520
to what we were talking about?

31:30.522 --> 31:32.422
I mean if we keep
putting it off--

31:32.424 --> 31:33.790
- You hear that?

31:33.792 --> 31:34.992
- Hear what?

31:34.994 --> 31:35.893
Will you please pay
attention to me?

31:35.895 --> 31:37.661
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.897
I'm just, just the morning,

31:39.899 --> 31:41.298
I need some coffee.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.332
- The morning.

31:42.334 --> 31:43.333
So.

31:43.335 --> 31:44.635
- So?

31:44.637 --> 31:45.402
- Oh my god, what
is wrong with you?

31:45.404 --> 31:46.603
- I just,

31:46.605 --> 31:48.238
I just need some
more time that's all.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.539
- Okay, how much more
time do you need?

31:49.541 --> 31:50.741
Another 15 months?

31:50.743 --> 31:51.975
- Just some time.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.443
Can we talk about this
when you get back?

31:53.445 --> 31:55.245
Fuck, do you hear that?

31:55.247 --> 31:56.513
- Okay, okay fine.

31:56.515 --> 31:57.381
But we're actually going
to have a conversation

31:57.383 --> 31:58.882
about it okay,

31:58.884 --> 32:00.751
so I would appreciate some
serious consideration.

32:00.753 --> 32:01.952
Okay?

32:01.954 --> 32:02.953
- You got it.

32:02.955 --> 32:04.454
Okay. I'll call you later.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.123
- Why are you acting like
such a fucking space cadet?

32:06.125 --> 32:07.591
- I'm sorry.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.159
I just.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.193
- [Dan] Kim, you ready?

32:10.195 --> 32:11.762
My film is in 20 minutes.

32:11.764 --> 32:13.664
- Yeah, just a second, Dan.

32:13.666 --> 32:14.564
Sorry.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.635
I'm sorry for jumping
down your throat.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.103
It's just

32:20.105 --> 32:21.571
I have been super crabby

32:21.573 --> 32:23.040
and so stressed out.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.808
And Fielding was here
early today and I--

32:24.810 --> 32:25.976
- [Dan] Kim, come on.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.711
Let's hustle.

32:27.713 --> 32:28.779
- [Kim] Okay.

32:28.781 --> 32:29.880
- I get it.

32:29.882 --> 32:30.881
Go to Dan.

32:30.883 --> 32:32.382
It's fine. Go have fun.

32:32.384 --> 32:33.617
- We'll just talk about,

32:33.619 --> 32:35.285
I'm gonna call you
back in a little bit.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.553
Okay.

32:36.555 --> 32:37.888
Alright, I'll talk
to you later then.

32:37.890 --> 32:38.989
- Adios.

32:38.991 --> 32:41.892
- [Kim] Love you, bye.
- Okay, bye.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.629
(soft music)

33:22.835 --> 33:26.570
(speaking foreign language)

33:38.851 --> 33:42.352
(slow suspenseful music)

34:01.673 --> 34:03.073
- What the fuck?

34:17.756 --> 34:19.289
Phin?

34:19.291 --> 34:20.457
Phin?

34:20.459 --> 34:21.858
Wake up.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.326
Hey man, wake up.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.163
Phin?

34:27.366 --> 34:30.834
(slow suspenseful music)

34:43.749 --> 34:48.819
(speaking foreign language)
(eerie music)

35:03.936 --> 35:04.835
- Ow.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.104
What the fuck?

35:07.973 --> 35:09.206
What the fuck?

35:10.309 --> 35:11.441
What is this shit?

35:11.443 --> 35:13.076
- You tell me buddy.

35:13.078 --> 35:14.444
- Get me out of
this fucking thing.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.513
What are you doing?

35:16.515 --> 35:18.415
Christ.

35:19.751 --> 35:20.650
Fuck.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.420
What's wrong with you?

35:23.422 --> 35:26.156
- You need to see somebody Phin.

35:26.992 --> 35:28.625
- I can't afford to.

35:28.627 --> 35:29.960
Not all of us have
nice little jobs

35:29.962 --> 35:33.864
that provide us with
great insurance.

35:33.866 --> 35:35.999
Man, I'm tired as shit.

35:36.001 --> 35:37.000
- Because you're up all night

35:37.002 --> 35:40.070
acting like a freak
instead of sleeping.

35:40.072 --> 35:42.305
And it's weird
and creepy,

35:42.307 --> 35:44.241
and starting to
get very annoying.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.343
- Well I didn't smoke
weed at all yesterday,

35:46.345 --> 35:48.311
so that blows that theory.

35:48.313 --> 35:49.513
Maybe you should just
lock me in my room,

35:49.515 --> 35:50.547
that way I'd quit bothering you.

35:50.549 --> 35:53.617
- Great. Great. That's great.

35:53.619 --> 35:54.818
You don't want to
fix it man, huh.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.987
You want to figure this out?

35:56.989 --> 35:58.288
- Do you have any suggestions?

35:58.290 --> 36:00.724
I would gladly listen
to them right now.

36:00.726 --> 36:03.160
(soft music)

36:10.035 --> 36:11.535
Dude, this ain't
never gonna work.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.536
- Yes it will.

36:12.538 --> 36:13.670
They don't give a shit.

36:14.606 --> 36:15.438
- Social?
- Huh?

36:15.440 --> 36:16.339
- Social?

36:19.545 --> 36:22.512
- Social security card,

36:22.814 --> 36:23.880
ID,

36:23.882 --> 36:25.182
insurance card.

36:25.184 --> 36:26.583
Any questions, I'm
sitting right here.

36:26.585 --> 36:27.484
- Hey,

36:28.820 --> 36:30.687
did you check out the
tits on the receptionist?

36:30.689 --> 36:31.688
- No.

36:31.690 --> 36:32.822
No, I didn't.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.495
- What the fuck is
with this music?

36:38.497 --> 36:39.930
- I don't know.

36:39.932 --> 36:41.831
I like it.

36:41.833 --> 36:42.799
- Birthdate?

36:42.801 --> 36:43.633
- What?

36:43.635 --> 36:44.868
- Birthdate?

36:44.870 --> 36:45.802
- We've been friends
since high school,

36:45.804 --> 36:46.603
you don't know my birthday?

36:46.605 --> 36:47.604
- I'm a guy.

36:47.606 --> 36:48.605
I don't remember birthdays.

36:48.607 --> 36:49.773
When's my birthday smart man?

36:49.775 --> 36:50.607
- November fourth.

36:50.609 --> 36:51.441
- Yeah, well you're gay.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.510
- [Receptionist] George.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.612
George.

36:57.049 --> 36:58.181
- George.

36:58.183 --> 36:59.416
- Oh, I am.

36:59.418 --> 37:00.317
That's me.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.456
- [George] Oh man.

37:08.026 --> 37:10.393
It feels good to finally
get out of the house.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.595
- If I'd known this
would have worked,

37:11.597 --> 37:12.896
I'd have gotten
that ingrown toenail

37:12.898 --> 37:14.064
taken care of last year.

37:14.066 --> 37:17.033
(laughter)

37:17.035 --> 37:19.102
Well, here goes nothing.

37:20.839 --> 37:21.838
- Dude, you think
that's a good idea

37:21.840 --> 37:23.740
taking that with beer?

37:26.078 --> 37:27.177
- I don't know.

37:27.179 --> 37:28.511
All I know is I'm tired as fuck.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.447
I can't get that
receptionist's tits

37:30.449 --> 37:31.748
out of my mind.

37:35.254 --> 37:36.152
You know,

37:37.456 --> 37:39.556
maybe we're just like
talking about this too much.

37:39.558 --> 37:42.525
I mean just making
it a bigger deal

37:42.527 --> 37:43.927
that what it is.

37:44.162 --> 37:45.528
And that's all I ever
think about anymore

37:45.530 --> 37:47.430
is sleeping or not sleeping.

37:47.432 --> 37:48.531
And that's all we
ever talk about.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.934
So let's just shut up about it.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.235
- Yeah, fine.

37:52.237 --> 37:54.504
I won't say anything else.

38:04.182 --> 38:05.482
The other night,

38:05.484 --> 38:07.584
when you were doing
the scratching thing,

38:07.586 --> 38:09.019
I didn't want to bring this up,

38:09.021 --> 38:11.354
but you said something.

38:11.356 --> 38:12.689
- Yeah, what?

38:12.691 --> 38:14.157
- I don't know.

38:14.159 --> 38:15.091
But you were pissed
off about something.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.092
It was in a different language.

38:16.094 --> 38:17.527
I don't know what it means.

38:17.529 --> 38:18.662
- Dude, I'm monolingual.

38:18.664 --> 38:19.663
- Whatever it was,

38:19.665 --> 38:21.431
it was fucking freaky, okay.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.432
And all of--

38:22.434 --> 38:24.034
- What did I just say?

38:24.036 --> 38:25.535
Okay.

38:25.537 --> 38:26.603
I'm tired of talking about
this shit all the time.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.271
Come on man.

38:28.273 --> 38:29.806
Can we focus on something
else like pussy or anything?

38:29.808 --> 38:31.274
- Yeah, great, fine.

38:31.276 --> 38:35.478
But you're the one who's
talking in fucking tongues.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.153
Hey babe, I was just
about to call you.

38:43.155 --> 38:44.621
- You were?

38:44.623 --> 38:46.122
That's hilarious.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.557
- Yeah, I'm gonna talk to
Phin tomorrow, promise.

38:47.559 --> 38:48.725
- Why bother?

38:49.995 --> 38:51.011
- What?

38:51.012 --> 38:52.028
- We should all live together,

38:52.030 --> 38:53.029
forever.

38:53.031 --> 38:54.064
Just the three of us.

38:54.066 --> 38:55.265
You, me, and Phin forever.

38:55.267 --> 38:56.533
It'll be cute.

38:56.535 --> 38:57.734
- You know what Kim,

38:57.736 --> 38:59.002
you're being a
little mean drunk,

38:59.004 --> 38:59.869
so I'm gonna hang up
the phone right now.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.104
- And you know what,

39:01.106 --> 39:02.272
Dan told me not
to tell you this,

39:02.274 --> 39:03.773
but I can't lie to you

39:03.775 --> 39:05.775
and not tell you would be lying.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.344
- Dan?

39:07.346 --> 39:09.145
- Yeah, Dan was here.

39:10.982 --> 39:13.249
You know I won 3,000 bucks
on the freaking slots

39:13.251 --> 39:14.584
in between freaking calls

39:14.586 --> 39:15.819
to you.

39:15.821 --> 39:18.655
Answer your phone.

39:18.657 --> 39:22.125
Check your fucking
computer for once, really.

39:22.127 --> 39:24.928
Anyway, Vanna from
marketing comes down

39:24.930 --> 39:26.730
with these like crazy

39:27.866 --> 39:28.765
shots.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.435
We started dancing and

39:32.437 --> 39:33.336
I got

39:34.306 --> 39:35.472
wasted.

39:35.474 --> 39:36.373
And

39:39.277 --> 39:40.176
I sort of,

39:41.880 --> 39:44.080
you know made out with someone.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.482
- Who was it?

39:45.484 --> 39:46.483
- I don't know.

39:46.485 --> 39:47.484
Who cares, I was drunk.

39:47.486 --> 39:48.318
- I care.

39:48.320 --> 39:49.252
Who the fuck was it?

39:49.254 --> 39:50.487
- George, George, you know what,

39:50.489 --> 39:51.321
I can't.

39:51.323 --> 39:52.155
I can't.

39:52.157 --> 39:53.123
I can't.

39:53.125 --> 39:54.357
- You know what.

39:54.359 --> 39:55.158
- [Kim] We can talk
about it tomorrow.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.393
- No, no, no, no.

39:56.395 --> 39:57.360
We can fucking talk
about this right now.

39:57.362 --> 39:58.361
- No.

39:58.363 --> 39:59.295
No.

39:59.297 --> 40:00.230
Because you're in a fucking cast

40:00.232 --> 40:01.798
and you can't do anything.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.633
And I go to Vegas and
have a fucking meltdown

40:03.635 --> 40:05.869
and you don't answer
my goddamn phone calls.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.937
So see how you like it.

40:07.939 --> 40:09.105
- God dammit.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.881
(thunder clapping)

40:39.271 --> 40:41.805
(eerie music)

41:20.679 --> 41:25.081
(speaking foreign language)

41:25.083 --> 41:26.983
- Get the fuck off me.

41:31.189 --> 41:33.423
(screams)

41:36.862 --> 41:39.429
(eerie music)

41:41.867 --> 41:44.601
(thunder claps)

41:57.749 --> 41:59.282
- George, what,

41:59.284 --> 42:00.483
what did I do?

42:03.922 --> 42:05.388
- I lost her man.

42:10.896 --> 42:11.794
Fuck.

42:13.398 --> 42:14.364
She's gone.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.635
- I'm sorry.

42:18.637 --> 42:20.904
Fuck, I didn't know man.

42:20.906 --> 42:22.372
If it makes you feel any better,

42:22.374 --> 42:24.974
my ex-fiance has the fucking--

42:24.976 --> 42:27.577
- How the fuck can you
compare that right now?

42:27.579 --> 42:28.978
- Like you cared about
Kim more than I did her

42:28.980 --> 42:30.313
just like fucking grown ups?

42:30.315 --> 42:31.214
- No.

42:32.751 --> 42:33.650
No.

42:35.720 --> 42:38.054
It was four years ago, man.

42:39.758 --> 42:40.657
Remember.

42:44.095 --> 42:46.930
It was just some fucking singer.

42:46.932 --> 42:50.600
Some fucking singer who
fucked both of us over.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.305
Where you going?

43:11.089 --> 43:12.989
That's good stuff man.

43:15.126 --> 43:16.192
- Come on man,

43:16.194 --> 43:18.261
you just lost your girl.

43:20.465 --> 43:22.265
I'm a fucking zombie.

43:25.470 --> 43:27.870
And we're both laying
on the goddam floor.

43:27.872 --> 43:30.206
(laughter)

43:50.128 --> 43:51.494
I am sorry about Kim.

43:51.496 --> 43:52.562
I really am.

43:54.833 --> 43:56.499
Your up.

43:56.501 --> 43:57.367
- Thanks.

44:02.107 --> 44:03.106
- George.

44:03.108 --> 44:04.507
George, Georgie.

44:06.611 --> 44:08.011
- Try to keep her from
getting (inaudible).

44:08.013 --> 44:10.246
You just can't use your--

44:10.248 --> 44:12.015
- He has a broken arm and leg

44:12.017 --> 44:13.449
and a lot of other
stuff going on.

44:13.451 --> 44:14.917
Can you blame him?

44:14.919 --> 44:16.152
Give him a break.

44:16.154 --> 44:17.253
- When's he coming back anyways?

44:17.255 --> 44:20.423
Why don't you come to my office?

44:20.425 --> 44:22.992
I got a package for you to sign.

44:22.994 --> 44:24.060
- Shh, don't.

44:24.062 --> 44:25.061
Get out of here.

44:25.063 --> 44:26.663
- Relax sexy.

44:26.665 --> 44:28.231
You don't see him.

44:31.102 --> 44:33.236
- But I can still
hear you, you douche.

44:33.238 --> 44:35.405
- Georgie, I am so sorry.

44:37.208 --> 44:38.608
- What was that?

44:40.111 --> 44:40.943
- Just.

44:40.945 --> 44:41.778
- What?

44:41.780 --> 44:42.679
- Shut up.

44:44.516 --> 44:45.415
Shit.

44:49.220 --> 44:51.521
(knocking)

45:01.399 --> 45:02.398
Look, I know you're in there.

45:02.400 --> 45:03.900
I just want to talk.

45:03.902 --> 45:05.301
Please, Georgie.

45:11.643 --> 45:12.642
I went to Vegas.

45:12.644 --> 45:13.643
I panicked.

45:18.249 --> 45:20.049
I got drunk and
I made a mistake.

45:20.051 --> 45:21.517
I'm so, so sorry.

45:22.987 --> 45:25.655
But it's not like I'm into Dan.

45:26.858 --> 45:28.257
It was just sex.

45:31.062 --> 45:33.362
(knocking)

45:39.704 --> 45:41.170
Georgie, come on.

45:43.308 --> 45:44.507
Fine.

45:44.509 --> 45:46.309
I'm leaving.

45:46.311 --> 45:48.344
Just text me, or

45:48.346 --> 45:50.246
call me, or something.

45:55.019 --> 45:57.019
- Organize this bitch.

45:57.021 --> 45:59.489
(rock music)

46:31.523 --> 46:32.688
- And then the thour buff,

46:32.690 --> 46:34.690
the clouds she waited all alone,

46:34.692 --> 46:35.825
day after day,

46:35.827 --> 46:37.660
hour after hour

46:37.662 --> 46:39.228
for the prince to rescue her

46:39.230 --> 46:41.297
as he had promised.

46:41.299 --> 46:42.832
And then one day,

46:42.834 --> 46:44.867
a white bird flew
into her window

46:44.869 --> 46:48.104
and perched itself
atop of her mirror.

46:49.207 --> 46:51.140
At first she tried
to scare it away

46:51.142 --> 46:54.010
until she noticed a
small scrap of paper

46:54.012 --> 46:55.511
tied to it's leg.

46:56.748 --> 46:58.848
There written in gold letters

46:58.850 --> 47:00.783
was just one word, fly.

47:01.853 --> 47:04.353
She looked out the window,

47:04.355 --> 47:05.354
through the clouds,

47:05.356 --> 47:06.689
around the low,

47:07.492 --> 47:10.159
but all she could see was

47:10.161 --> 47:12.728
(eerie music)

47:43.895 --> 47:44.794
George.

47:45.930 --> 47:47.063
- Hey, you're walking.

47:47.065 --> 47:48.264
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

47:48.266 --> 47:49.432
We heard some sounds downstairs.

47:49.434 --> 47:50.700
- Da da da.

47:50.702 --> 47:51.734
I fall down.

47:51.736 --> 47:52.802
No big deal.

47:52.804 --> 47:54.136
It's okay.

47:54.138 --> 47:55.705
George, it's late.

47:56.574 --> 47:58.507
Please, go to bed.

47:58.509 --> 47:59.408
- Yeah.

48:00.545 --> 48:02.078
Have a good night.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.049
I got it.

48:07.051 --> 48:08.050
I'm not a charity case.

48:08.052 --> 48:09.819
- How was therapy, George?

48:09.821 --> 48:10.953
- It sucks.

48:10.955 --> 48:12.321
It's therapy.

48:12.323 --> 48:13.322
- Yeah.

48:13.324 --> 48:14.457
- It's painful.

48:14.459 --> 48:15.424
Yeah.

48:15.426 --> 48:16.759
Thanks for the ride, man.

48:16.761 --> 48:17.693
I appreciate it.
- Whatever man, no problem.

48:17.695 --> 48:18.861
It's interesting, the whole.

48:18.863 --> 48:20.763
- [Andre] It's
really nice of you.

48:20.765 --> 48:22.565
Like it's actually interesting.

48:22.567 --> 48:24.834
- Wait two second.

48:24.836 --> 48:26.936
- Where are you going?

48:26.938 --> 48:28.104
- Just a second.

48:28.106 --> 48:29.839
- No, I will be home soon.

48:29.841 --> 48:31.340
- I gotta ask you a question.

48:31.342 --> 48:33.009
Please.

48:33.011 --> 48:34.110
I'm sorry, I don't
mean to bother you.

48:34.112 --> 48:35.344
The other day,

48:35.346 --> 48:36.379
you were arguing
with my landlord.

48:36.381 --> 48:37.914
I just want to know.

48:37.916 --> 48:39.148
- Da, from Russia,

48:39.150 --> 48:40.316
near my town.

48:40.318 --> 48:41.751
Big shot doctor.

48:41.753 --> 48:43.319
Wife disappeared.

48:43.321 --> 48:45.121
Police investigate.

48:45.123 --> 48:46.822
Suddenly they are both gone.

48:46.824 --> 48:49.392
- They, who do you mean they?

48:49.394 --> 48:50.493
Who's they?

48:50.495 --> 48:51.727
- Both of them.

48:51.729 --> 48:54.263
- No, no, no, no, that
doesn't make sense.

48:54.265 --> 48:56.632
You said that the wife died,

48:56.634 --> 48:57.833
but Mr. Romanovsky.

48:57.835 --> 48:59.368
- He means the
doctor and who else,

48:59.370 --> 49:00.603
the children maybe?

49:00.605 --> 49:02.171
- No, doctor and daughter.

49:02.173 --> 49:03.072
They.

49:04.075 --> 49:05.274
- You mean Mr. Romanovsky.

49:05.276 --> 49:06.475
- Da.

49:06.477 --> 49:07.476
Romanov.

49:07.478 --> 49:08.511
Very rude.

49:08.513 --> 49:10.246
I give my regards to his family.

49:10.248 --> 49:11.681
Very nice.

49:11.683 --> 49:13.282
He say I have no family.

49:13.284 --> 49:14.684
You make mistake.

49:14.686 --> 49:16.786
I say how is little Sophie.

49:16.788 --> 49:19.522
He say mind your business.

49:19.524 --> 49:21.090
Very rude.

49:21.092 --> 49:22.758
Now, I must go.

49:22.760 --> 49:24.427
Victor needs his cream.

49:24.429 --> 49:25.428
- Wait, one more question.

49:25.430 --> 49:26.462
- Let her go.

49:26.464 --> 49:27.630
Come on.

49:27.632 --> 49:29.298
- God dammit.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.800
- See, now you hurt yourself.

49:30.802 --> 49:32.601
- No, I fine.

49:32.603 --> 49:34.503
No, I'm good.

49:34.505 --> 49:36.739
- What was that all about?

49:39.978 --> 49:41.811
- He Phin, wake up.

49:41.813 --> 49:42.845
Darn it, wake up.

49:42.847 --> 49:43.879
Hey.

49:43.881 --> 49:45.114
- What?

49:45.116 --> 49:46.315
- I just found out
some crazy shit.

49:46.317 --> 49:49.118
Romanovsky used to
be a doctor in Russia

49:49.120 --> 49:52.021
with a beautiful
wife and daughter.

49:52.023 --> 49:53.622
And they just disappeared.

49:53.624 --> 49:55.291
- Romanovsky doesn't
have a family.

49:55.293 --> 49:56.659
- I know.

49:56.661 --> 49:57.994
That's my point.

49:57.996 --> 49:59.228
Where'd they go?

49:59.230 --> 50:00.529
- Man, Romanovsky's awesome.

50:00.531 --> 50:01.430
- Phin.

50:02.533 --> 50:04.867
You've been speaking
Russian in your sleep.

50:04.869 --> 50:08.137
- The whole neighborhood
speaks Russian.

50:08.139 --> 50:10.806
- You went to one sleep
specialist and you bailed.

50:10.808 --> 50:13.342
I've been helping you
out for weeks now.

50:13.344 --> 50:15.711
You can indulge me
in this one thing.

50:15.713 --> 50:17.079
- God, alright.

50:17.081 --> 50:18.080
Fuck.

50:18.082 --> 50:20.049
What do you want?

50:20.051 --> 50:21.550
- I'm gonna sneak up stairs.

50:21.552 --> 50:23.519
I'm gonna look around and
see if I can find anything.

50:23.521 --> 50:24.420
- Okay.

50:25.656 --> 50:27.656
- I need you to
be awake by noon.

50:27.658 --> 50:28.557
Okay.

50:29.527 --> 50:31.027
- Get me some coffee.

50:31.029 --> 50:32.094
- Okay.

50:32.096 --> 50:33.729
Wake up.

50:33.731 --> 50:35.531
- I bookmarked a page for you.

50:35.533 --> 50:36.699
- It's gross.

51:14.038 --> 51:16.872
(dramatic music)

51:21.045 --> 51:22.078
- Fuck.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.212
- Sorry.

51:23.214 --> 51:24.513
Sorry.

51:24.515 --> 51:26.048
It's the only thing that works.

51:26.050 --> 51:26.949
- Dammit.

51:27.919 --> 51:29.552
- Here.

51:29.554 --> 51:30.553
Sit right here.

51:30.555 --> 51:32.822
Just, now just wake up.

51:32.824 --> 51:34.590
I wouldn't have to
use it all the time.

51:34.592 --> 51:35.558
- Shit man.

51:38.796 --> 51:40.830
Now just keep playing.

51:40.832 --> 51:42.731
Phineas, play that

51:42.733 --> 51:43.632
loud.

51:44.535 --> 51:45.401
Okay.

51:46.804 --> 51:48.370
Don't stop playing.

51:48.372 --> 51:49.472
- I got it, alright.

51:49.474 --> 51:50.706
My fucking fingers hurt.

51:50.708 --> 51:51.874
My face hurts.

51:51.876 --> 51:53.042
- What is that?

51:53.044 --> 51:53.909
Speed?

51:55.213 --> 51:57.413
- I gotta stay up somehow.

52:05.790 --> 52:07.223
- Hey, Mr. Romanovsky.

52:07.225 --> 52:08.624
Sorry to bother you.

52:08.626 --> 52:10.559
We're having a little problem
with the kitchen sink.

52:10.561 --> 52:11.727
- What happened?

52:11.729 --> 52:13.395
- I don't know.

52:13.397 --> 52:15.164
Just started leaking.

52:15.166 --> 52:16.232
- Just started leaking.

52:16.234 --> 52:18.734
- Yeah, just started leaking.

52:19.637 --> 52:21.904
(guitar playing)

52:25.476 --> 52:29.211
(speaking foreign language)

52:46.597 --> 52:47.763
- If something breaks,

52:47.765 --> 52:48.998
just call.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.032
Don't fix.

52:50.034 --> 52:51.500
You only make worse.

52:51.502 --> 52:52.535
- I'm sorry, Mr. Romanovsky.

52:52.537 --> 52:53.802
That's my fault.

52:53.804 --> 52:56.238
I thought I could just
wrench it back together.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.606
- I go get part.

52:58.509 --> 52:59.375
Be back.

53:00.912 --> 53:03.712
(guitar playing)

53:10.655 --> 53:11.887
- Alright man, listen.

53:11.889 --> 53:13.122
He's gonna be at the
store for an hour.

53:13.124 --> 53:14.290
Keep playing.

53:16.093 --> 53:18.928
Unless you see
him, keep playing.

53:20.765 --> 53:23.599
(guitar playing)

53:52.196 --> 53:54.763
(eerie music)

56:07.131 --> 56:08.030
Hello.

56:08.933 --> 56:11.500
(eerie music)

56:30.988 --> 56:32.054
Oh dear god.

56:40.831 --> 56:42.831
What's he doing to you?

56:47.605 --> 56:50.406
(dramatic music)

57:00.251 --> 57:02.751
(eerie music)

57:08.426 --> 57:09.324
Dammit.

57:12.596 --> 57:13.595
Phin.

57:13.597 --> 57:14.863
- What?

57:14.865 --> 57:17.132
- Sophie, she's fucking
hooked up to something.

57:17.134 --> 57:19.468
She's up there right now

57:19.470 --> 57:20.369
in a coma.

57:22.006 --> 57:24.807
I think she just woke up.

57:24.809 --> 57:26.442
- That's great.

57:26.444 --> 57:27.609
- Dude, Phin,

57:27.611 --> 57:29.511
she hummed your song.

57:29.513 --> 57:31.046
The song you've been playing

57:31.048 --> 57:33.415
over and over and over again.

57:33.417 --> 57:34.750
- She heard it.

57:35.920 --> 57:38.787
- Dude, she's in a
fucking coma or not.

57:38.789 --> 57:41.123
I don't fucking
know what she's in.

57:41.125 --> 57:42.791
But here's what I think man.

57:42.793 --> 57:44.259
I think

57:44.261 --> 57:47.529
that she's trying to
reach you in her sleep.

57:47.531 --> 57:49.431
We've got to do something.

57:49.433 --> 57:51.099
- Dude, she's sick.

57:52.002 --> 57:53.902
Romanovsky is awesome.

57:55.773 --> 57:57.439
Will you please go on, crazy.

57:57.441 --> 57:58.941
I just want to
take a fucking nap.

57:58.943 --> 58:00.776
- Dude, Phin I'm trying
to fucking help you.

58:00.778 --> 58:03.245
She is up there right now.

58:03.247 --> 58:04.146
Fuck.

58:05.416 --> 58:06.448
Perfect.

58:06.450 --> 58:07.349
Shit.

58:12.389 --> 58:13.222
Holy shit.

58:13.224 --> 58:14.456
- [Phin] What?

58:17.528 --> 58:18.861
- What?

58:18.863 --> 58:19.761
- SR.

58:22.166 --> 58:23.665
- I don't get it.

58:25.336 --> 58:26.235
- SR

58:27.137 --> 58:29.338
from the Ouija thing.

58:29.340 --> 58:30.239
- Oh shit.

58:31.542 --> 58:33.775
(ticking)

59:03.908 --> 59:07.109
Yes, this is George Fishburn.

59:07.111 --> 59:11.013
Yes, this is a person of
very significant importancy.

59:11.015 --> 59:11.914
Hi.

59:13.450 --> 59:15.584
I'm an anonymous man.

59:15.586 --> 59:17.252
Hi, I'm a suspect.

59:17.254 --> 59:19.454
I know of certain
things my landlord.

59:19.456 --> 59:21.590
This is George Fishburn.

59:21.592 --> 59:23.525
I live downstairs from a man.

59:23.527 --> 59:25.494
- He took his daughter.

59:26.397 --> 59:27.796
I'd like to report.

59:27.798 --> 59:29.698
Hi, my name is George.

59:31.869 --> 59:34.169
My name is George Fishburn.

59:35.172 --> 59:38.140
I know about
suspicious activities.

59:41.378 --> 59:42.411
- George.

59:42.413 --> 59:43.412
- Sorry.

59:43.414 --> 59:44.413
It's so early.

59:44.415 --> 59:45.447
It's kind of important though.

59:45.449 --> 59:47.015
- No, no, please come in.

59:47.017 --> 59:48.283
I'll make us coffee.

59:48.285 --> 59:49.751
- Thanks, thanks.

59:52.022 --> 59:52.854
- Shit.

59:52.856 --> 59:53.855
- Yeah.

59:53.857 --> 59:54.957
- He hasn't been
sleeping at all.

59:54.959 --> 59:55.857
- No.

59:56.694 --> 59:58.393
- I knew something happened.

59:58.395 --> 59:59.828
- Yeah, and that's
why I came over.

59:59.830 --> 1:00:01.663
I was gonna bring
the devil board.

1:00:01.665 --> 1:00:02.798
- No, George.

1:00:03.834 --> 1:00:05.500
That thing is stupid.

1:00:05.502 --> 1:00:08.003
It just opened a window.

1:00:08.005 --> 1:00:12.407
What you're looking for
is more of a doorway.

1:00:12.409 --> 1:00:13.408
- Doorway?

1:00:13.410 --> 1:00:14.409
What do you mean doorway?

1:00:14.411 --> 1:00:15.410
What do you mean by that?

1:00:15.412 --> 1:00:16.745
- I don't know.

1:00:16.747 --> 1:00:17.879
It usually has to do with

1:00:17.881 --> 1:00:18.914
animals,

1:00:18.916 --> 1:00:20.382
chicken sacrifice,

1:00:20.384 --> 1:00:21.883
pig's blood,

1:00:21.885 --> 1:00:22.985
eye of newt.

1:00:22.987 --> 1:00:24.419
I don't know.

1:00:24.421 --> 1:00:27.289
I used to be into all this
stuff when I was in high school,

1:00:27.291 --> 1:00:29.791
but I'm not a witch or anything.

1:00:29.793 --> 1:00:31.293
- But that's why
I came over here

1:00:31.295 --> 1:00:32.995
because I knew you were
into spiritual stuff.

1:00:32.997 --> 1:00:33.895
And I just

1:00:34.765 --> 1:00:36.064
fucking running out ideas here.

1:00:36.066 --> 1:00:37.633
- Okay.

1:00:37.635 --> 1:00:40.102
Listen, I've had a friend took
me to a psychic library once.

1:00:40.104 --> 1:00:42.738
Why don't you let
me get dressed.

1:00:42.740 --> 1:00:44.940
We can head over there and
find out what they know.

1:00:44.942 --> 1:00:45.941
- Yeah.

1:00:45.943 --> 1:00:47.209
No, that's great.

1:00:47.211 --> 1:00:50.145
- You want to slow
down on the coffee?

1:01:02.026 --> 1:01:04.059
- [Romanovsky]
You look terrible.

1:01:04.061 --> 1:01:06.561
(soft music)

1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:11.266
¶ I feel like ¶

1:01:11.268 --> 1:01:12.267
- [Olivia] Well.

1:01:12.269 --> 1:01:13.802
- [George] Yeah.

1:01:13.804 --> 1:01:15.003
- [Olivia] I'm sorry that
was a total waste of time.

1:01:15.005 --> 1:01:15.937
- I know I think
it's a prerequisite

1:01:15.939 --> 1:01:18.173
to be a psychic librarian,

1:01:18.175 --> 1:01:20.042
you've got to be
completely insane.

1:01:20.044 --> 1:01:21.376
- Yeah, well.

1:01:21.378 --> 1:01:23.145
(laughter)

1:01:23.147 --> 1:01:24.046
- So.

1:01:24.982 --> 1:01:26.014
Yeah.

1:01:26.016 --> 1:01:28.150
- How are you holding up?

1:01:29.119 --> 1:01:30.619
I mean about Kim.

1:01:32.022 --> 1:01:34.256
- I mean that's, I'm okay.

1:01:35.626 --> 1:01:38.260
The whole thing with Phin
puts it in perspective,

1:01:38.262 --> 1:01:39.661
I guess, you know.

1:01:39.663 --> 1:01:41.697
Why have you talked to her?

1:01:41.699 --> 1:01:42.831
- No.

1:01:42.833 --> 1:01:44.366
No.

1:01:44.368 --> 1:01:46.368
Not in a while.

1:01:46.370 --> 1:01:47.235
You know.

1:01:51.642 --> 1:01:53.742
I'll let you go, George.

1:01:53.744 --> 1:01:56.078
Take care of yourself.

1:01:56.080 --> 1:01:57.112
- Okay.

1:01:57.114 --> 1:01:58.113
- Okay.

1:01:58.115 --> 1:01:58.980
- Thanks.

1:02:00.084 --> 1:02:01.083
¶ Never ¶

1:02:01.085 --> 1:02:02.551
- Hold on Olivia.

1:02:03.721 --> 1:02:05.087
I know you didn't want
to talk about it, but

1:02:05.089 --> 1:02:07.189
I have to ask you.

1:02:07.191 --> 1:02:09.024
That night with Phin,

1:02:13.097 --> 1:02:14.496
what did he say?

1:02:17.735 --> 1:02:20.235
- He didn't say anything.

1:02:20.237 --> 1:02:23.305
He just sat there and
stared at his hands.

1:02:23.307 --> 1:02:24.406
- Nothing, that's it.

1:02:24.408 --> 1:02:25.307
- Yeah.

1:02:28.345 --> 1:02:30.278
I mean you had to be there.

1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:31.179
It was,

1:02:32.516 --> 1:02:34.483
it was mainly the eyes.

1:02:35.986 --> 1:02:36.885
- Okay.

1:02:38.455 --> 1:02:39.554
- [Olivia] Sorry.

1:02:39.556 --> 1:02:40.622
- Thanks.

1:02:40.624 --> 1:02:42.157
- Eat something.

1:02:42.159 --> 1:02:43.058
Bye.

1:02:50.033 --> 1:02:52.501
(soft music)

1:03:00.511 --> 1:03:01.843
- Phineas, wake up.

1:03:01.845 --> 1:03:03.879
Let's get out of here, man.

1:03:03.881 --> 1:03:05.046
I couldn't figure anything out.

1:03:05.048 --> 1:03:06.414
Let's go over to
Andre's or something.

1:03:06.416 --> 1:03:09.918
(slow suspenseful music)

1:03:15.292 --> 1:03:16.191
Fuck.

1:03:17.094 --> 1:03:17.993
Shit.

1:03:23.734 --> 1:03:27.235
(slow suspenseful music)

1:03:49.526 --> 1:03:50.425
Oh no.

1:03:51.795 --> 1:03:52.694
No.

1:03:57.267 --> 1:03:58.133
No.

1:04:00.237 --> 1:04:02.704
(eerie music)

1:05:08.639 --> 1:05:09.537
You.

1:05:10.841 --> 1:05:13.408
(eerie music)

1:05:19.816 --> 1:05:21.316
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1:05:23.053 --> 1:05:25.620
(eerie music)

1:06:16.573 --> 1:06:17.973
I can't believe it's
been three months.

1:06:17.975 --> 1:06:19.341
The police, they just no clue.

1:06:19.343 --> 1:06:20.241
My head

1:06:21.578 --> 1:06:23.111
can't keep things.

1:06:23.113 --> 1:06:24.346
- [Andre] Hey it's okay.

1:06:24.348 --> 1:06:25.547
- Guys' thanks

1:06:25.549 --> 1:06:26.915
for the help, you know.

1:06:26.917 --> 1:06:28.183
You didn't really have to.

1:06:28.185 --> 1:06:29.451
- No problem Georgie pan.

1:06:29.453 --> 1:06:31.720
I have to get back though.

1:06:31.722 --> 1:06:34.155
I have to (inaudible)
coming over.

1:06:34.157 --> 1:06:35.523
- Wait, you moved in?

1:06:35.525 --> 1:06:36.558
- Yeah.

1:06:36.560 --> 1:06:37.659
- I didn't know that.

1:06:37.661 --> 1:06:38.727
- Yeah.

1:06:38.729 --> 1:06:39.995
I needed a place to stay.

1:06:39.997 --> 1:06:40.962
So Georgie here let me
take Phin's old room.

1:06:40.964 --> 1:06:42.097
- [Olivia] That's great.

1:06:42.099 --> 1:06:43.398
- Until we find him.

1:06:43.400 --> 1:06:44.799
- You don't have to be

1:06:44.801 --> 1:06:46.167
all emotional about it.

1:06:46.169 --> 1:06:47.168
It's fine.

1:06:47.170 --> 1:06:48.169
I know there's a chance I'm

1:06:48.171 --> 1:06:50.238
not gonna see him again.

1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:52.440
His mom keeps calling me.

1:06:52.442 --> 1:06:53.808
And she wants to come out.

1:06:53.810 --> 1:06:55.343
- George.

1:06:55.345 --> 1:06:56.578
- I don't even know what's
right in my head anymore.

1:06:56.580 --> 1:06:58.079
- George, you're
doing a great job.

1:06:58.081 --> 1:06:59.114
- Yeah.

1:06:59.116 --> 1:07:00.148
- You are.

1:07:00.150 --> 1:07:01.583
- Thanks guys.

1:07:01.585 --> 1:07:03.551
- Guys, I've got to go.

1:07:04.955 --> 1:07:06.554
- You're taking off.

1:07:06.556 --> 1:07:07.789
- Yeah.

1:07:07.791 --> 1:07:09.324
I'm teaching a yoga
class in like minutes.

1:07:09.326 --> 1:07:10.992
I'm so super late.

1:07:10.994 --> 1:07:12.260
- Thank you Olive Branch.

1:07:12.262 --> 1:07:13.528
- George.

1:07:13.530 --> 1:07:14.729
- I'll see you later.

1:07:14.731 --> 1:07:15.997
- Call me, okay.
- Alright, will do.

1:07:15.999 --> 1:07:16.831
- Bye.

1:07:16.833 --> 1:07:17.732
- Adios.

1:07:18.935 --> 1:07:19.934
That was nice.

1:07:19.936 --> 1:07:20.969
- Sweet.

1:07:20.971 --> 1:07:22.237
- She's nice.

1:07:22.239 --> 1:07:25.073
- George, you should
definitely call her.

1:07:25.075 --> 1:07:26.608
- That'll be weird,
man, you know.

1:07:26.610 --> 1:07:28.009
- Life is weird.

1:07:30.047 --> 1:07:30.879
- [Olivia] Hello.

1:07:30.881 --> 1:07:31.880
- Olivia.

1:07:31.882 --> 1:07:33.348
Hey.

1:07:33.350 --> 1:07:37.752
I didn't think you'd
actually answer the phone.

1:07:37.754 --> 1:07:39.054
I just

1:07:39.056 --> 1:07:40.855
wanted to say to for today.

1:07:40.857 --> 1:07:43.024
I want to see if you

1:07:43.026 --> 1:07:44.426
want to do it again.

1:07:44.428 --> 1:07:45.960
Not the

1:07:45.962 --> 1:07:48.363
same activity, of course.

1:07:48.365 --> 1:07:49.764
Something different.

1:07:49.766 --> 1:07:51.232
Yeah.

1:07:51.234 --> 1:07:52.467
A movie maybe.

1:07:53.637 --> 1:07:55.136
No, tomorrow's great.

1:07:55.138 --> 1:07:56.604
You

1:07:56.606 --> 1:07:57.605
can

1:07:57.607 --> 1:07:58.640
perfect,

1:07:58.642 --> 1:07:59.674
do it.

1:07:59.676 --> 1:08:00.809
So,

1:08:00.811 --> 1:08:02.677
I'll call you tomorrow.

1:08:02.679 --> 1:08:05.246
- [Olivia] Good night, George.

1:08:24.634 --> 1:08:28.103
(slow suspenseful music)

1:09:02.639 --> 1:09:05.540
- I feel like toasted shit.

1:09:05.542 --> 1:09:07.108
- Grease man.

1:09:07.110 --> 1:09:09.244
Grease absorbs alcohol.

1:09:09.246 --> 1:09:10.245
- Yeah, so fuck it,

1:09:10.247 --> 1:09:11.412
orange juice.

1:09:12.516 --> 1:09:15.450
Did you hear Diana
leave this morning?

1:09:16.253 --> 1:09:17.152
- Nope.

1:09:18.755 --> 1:09:20.388
Just woke up.

1:09:20.390 --> 1:09:21.523
Slept like shit.

1:09:21.525 --> 1:09:22.524
- Yeah, not shit, huh.

1:09:22.526 --> 1:09:23.424
- Huh?

1:09:25.762 --> 1:09:28.363
- Just a second, huh.

1:09:28.365 --> 1:09:31.099
(phone ringing)

1:09:33.170 --> 1:09:34.369
Hello.

1:10:10.674 --> 1:10:11.673
I didn't see her.

1:10:11.675 --> 1:10:12.907
- I don't know.

1:10:12.909 --> 1:10:14.409

I mean I probably would
have left with her.

1:10:21.384 --> 1:10:23.284
I mean if I was with her

1:10:23.286 --> 1:10:24.986
Yeah, seriously.

She went crazy.

Okay, just, here.

1:10:38.401 --> 1:10:39.734

1:10:39.736 --> 1:10:40.902
You got to get out of here.

You got to get your stuff.

1:10:43.139 --> 1:10:44.239

1:10:44.241 --> 1:10:45.406
- [Andre] George.

1:10:45.408 --> 1:10:46.441
- Not one more night.

1:10:46.443 --> 1:10:47.442
This is non fucking negotiable.

1:10:47.444 --> 1:10:48.443
- [Andre] What are you doing?

1:10:48.445 --> 1:10:49.444
I just did laundry, George.

1:10:49.446 --> 1:10:50.545
Listen, you need to--

1:10:50.547 --> 1:10:51.613
- Fuck your laundry, Andre.

1:10:51.615 --> 1:10:52.447
- Dammit, George.

1:10:52.449 --> 1:10:53.281
- Fuck.

1:10:53.283 --> 1:10:54.749
You gotta go.

1:10:54.751 --> 1:10:55.450
- [Andre] Why, just
because you said some shit

1:10:55.452 --> 1:10:56.417
in your sleep?

1:10:56.419 --> 1:10:57.118
- What fuck was I saying?

1:10:57.120 --> 1:10:58.086
Call Diane.

1:10:58.088 --> 1:10:58.953
Does she know what I'm saying?

1:10:58.955 --> 1:10:59.787
- I don know.

1:10:59.789 --> 1:11:00.722
- Huh?

1:11:00.724 --> 1:11:01.456
- [Andre] I don't know, George.

1:11:01.458 --> 1:11:02.457
I'm sorry.

1:11:02.459 --> 1:11:03.458
- Would Diana know?

1:11:03.460 --> 1:11:04.425
- Come on, maybe.

1:11:04.427 --> 1:11:05.360
We thought you woke up.

1:11:05.362 --> 1:11:06.160
You were just dreaming, George.

1:11:06.162 --> 1:11:07.428
- Would you call her?

1:11:07.430 --> 1:11:08.229
Would you call her and
tell her to come over?

1:11:08.231 --> 1:11:08.896
Would she talk to me?

1:11:08.898 --> 1:11:10.031
- I don't know.

1:11:10.033 --> 1:11:10.965
She's a superstitious
chick, George.

1:11:10.967 --> 1:11:12.333
Give her a little time maybe.

1:11:12.335 --> 1:11:13.835
- You could tie me up.

1:11:13.837 --> 1:11:14.969
You could put a fucking
gun in my mouth.

1:11:14.971 --> 1:11:16.337
Okay.

1:11:16.339 --> 1:11:17.605
Just call her, please, for me.

1:11:17.607 --> 1:11:19.073
Please.

1:11:19.075 --> 1:11:20.074
Just call her.

1:11:20.076 --> 1:11:21.476
- Okay, I'll call her, George.

1:11:21.478 --> 1:11:23.878
It's not like it's
going to bring,

1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:25.680
I mean did you ever consider

1:11:25.682 --> 1:11:28.850
maybe it's better
if you didn't know.

1:11:36.826 --> 1:11:38.059
Hold on to your pants.

1:11:38.061 --> 1:11:38.960
Okay.

1:11:39.996 --> 1:11:42.664
Andre has everything
under control.

1:11:42.666 --> 1:11:43.665
Alright.

1:11:43.667 --> 1:11:44.766
Honey, Diana, baby,

1:11:44.768 --> 1:11:46.301
it's okay.

1:11:46.303 --> 1:11:47.602
You just relax, okay.

1:11:47.604 --> 1:11:50.004
If he makes a move, I stab him.

1:11:50.006 --> 1:11:51.306
Alright.

1:11:51.308 --> 1:11:53.508
Come here sweetie.

1:11:53.510 --> 1:11:55.310
Alright, honey.

1:11:55.312 --> 1:11:57.445
It's okay, sweetie, baby.

1:12:00.050 --> 1:12:00.815
Okay, see.

1:12:00.817 --> 1:12:01.783
It's George.

1:12:01.785 --> 1:12:02.984
Hi Georgie.

1:12:02.986 --> 1:12:04.252
- I'm sorry for freaking
you out last night.

1:12:04.254 --> 1:12:05.787
It wasn't

1:12:05.789 --> 1:12:07.021
on purpose.

1:12:07.023 --> 1:12:08.523
Okay.

1:12:08.525 --> 1:12:10.525
It's really important

1:12:10.527 --> 1:12:12.994
that you tell me what I said
to you last night, okay.

1:12:12.996 --> 1:12:13.995
- Okay, baby.

1:12:13.997 --> 1:12:15.229
Look, I protect you.

1:12:15.231 --> 1:12:17.832
Okay, I'm gonna
go for ice cream.

1:12:19.069 --> 1:12:19.967
- Please.

1:12:23.473 --> 1:12:24.372
- You

1:12:25.942 --> 1:12:26.841
your

1:12:27.911 --> 1:12:28.810
George.

1:12:30.213 --> 1:12:33.715
(slow suspenseful music)

1:12:45.395 --> 1:12:46.294
George.

1:12:53.903 --> 1:12:55.036
And then you,

1:12:56.506 --> 1:12:57.372
George,

1:12:59.342 --> 1:13:00.241
George,

1:13:00.243 --> 1:13:03.611
(slow suspenseful music)

1:13:16.626 --> 1:13:18.860
(screams)

1:13:33.309 --> 1:13:33.875
- George.

1:13:37.213 --> 1:13:38.546
Oh god, George.

1:13:41.284 --> 1:13:44.752
(slow suspenseful music)

1:14:17.053 --> 1:14:19.287
(ticking)

1:14:31.201 --> 1:14:33.768
(eerie music)

1:16:40.029 --> 1:16:42.697
(violin plays)

1:17:56.406 --> 1:17:58.973
(eerie music)
