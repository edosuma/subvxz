<i>I let him drive the El Camino.</i>

02:54.500 --> 02:56.400
He scratched the back fender.

- Tell me where Darnell is.
- Look.

02:59.340 --> 03:02.400
He-He doesn't know where Darnell is. I swear.
Just leave my brother alone.

03:02.510 --> 03:04.910

to torture or even kill the thing you love...

03:18.530 --> 03:20.390
that's when you can keep it to yourself.

03:20.490 --> 03:23.760
All right, fellas. You got about five minutes
before this bomb goes off.

03:23.860 --> 03:28.030
Okay. You-You let my brother go,

<i>Darnell testified before something called</i>
<i>a "sub committee"...</i>

12:06.790 --> 12:10.090
<i>and nearly brought down</i>
<i>his father's entire agency.</i>

12:10.190 --> 12:13.720
My father never forgave me for testifying.
The whole agency wanted me dead.

12:13.830 --> 12:15.920
That's why I had to go into Witness Protection.

12:16.030 --> 12:19.190
So your dad turned you into a trained assassin.

12:19.300 --> 12:22.230
My dad would make me hold
the flashlight when he'd work under the sink.

12:22.340 --> 12:26.200
<i>Sometimes dads suck, but you gotta get past it.</i>

12:26.310 --> 12:29.540

a belated birthday card for you.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.240
Oh, no.

- [Beeping]
- Oh, no.

12:34.380 --> 12:37.110

- Wake up. He didn't like the card.

Hello, Dad.

Stop blocking. I'm your father.

13:04.710 --> 13:07.680
You weren't a father. If you were a father,
you would've coached my archery team...

13:07.780 --> 13:11.480
or taught me falconry
or at least given me a hug once in a while.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.750
I knew what kind of life lay ahead of you...

13:16.860 --> 13:20.020
and I didn't want you
to be soft like your brother.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.850
- What brother?
- That's not important.

13:29.770 --> 13:32.860
You robbed me of a childhood
and apparently of a brother.

13:39.950 --> 13:42.740
Oh. Hey. This is a waste of time.

13:42.850 --> 13:46.290
I trained you too well.
Neither one of us is gonna land a punch.

You're right.

so can anyone at the agency.

- I want to give you a chance...

14:11.540 --> 14:13.570
to make up for what you did to the agency.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.980
<i>So you can stop running.</i>
<i>You can go back to living your life again.</i>

14:17.080 --> 14:20.480
- What would I have to do?
- One last mission.

14:20.590 --> 14:23.720
- And then I'm out? No strings attached?
- <i>Yes.</i>

14:23.820 --> 14:27.990
- Uncle Sam has agreed to wipe the slate clean.
- Uncle Sam the government...

14:28.090 --> 14:31.000
or your freaky brother who used to pay me
a hundred dollars to rub his feet?

14:31.100 --> 14:32.560
The government.

14:36.170 --> 14:40.200

<i>But to Darnell,</i>
<i>eating TVdinners alone was no life at all.</i>

14:46.380 --> 14:49.840
<i>So he'd do anything</i>
<i>so they could be the family they used to be.</i>

14:52.650 --> 14:56.050

15:15.980 --> 15:18.880
My father brought you along
to make sure I cooperate.

15:18.980 --> 15:22.040
He has trust issues.
I promise, no long-term harm will come to you...

15:22.150 --> 15:24.950
unless, of course, harm comes to me,
in which case, I doubt you'll survive.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.540
But I prefer to focus on the positive.

15:27.650 --> 15:29.550
Okay.

15:29.660 --> 15:32.990
I'm gonna give you a shot to knock you out,
so you don't see anything you're not supposed to.
