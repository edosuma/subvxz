<i>Have you ever had a secret...</i>

00:11.633 --> 00:13.692
<i>... that you couldn't</i>

00:15.970 --> 00:19.337
<i>And you think about it so much...</i>

00:19.441 --> 00:22.808

<i>Hi, this is Janet.</i>

00:39.894 --> 00:41.828
<i>I'm not here right now.</i>
<i>Leave a message. </i>

00:41.930 --> 00:44.364
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

00:44.466 --> 00:47.867
<i>Hey, sweetie.
It's been a long time.</i>

00:47.969 --> 00:49.630
<i>That's okay, though.</i>

00:49.738 --> 00:52.502
<i>I know we'll talk when you're ready.</i>

00:52.607 --> 00:55.405
<i>You've always done things</i>
<i>at your own speed.</i>

00:55.510 --> 00:58.411
<i>Ever since you were a little baby.</i>

00:58.513 --> 01:02.950
<i>I guess I still think of you that way.</i>

01:03.118 --> 01:06.007
<i>Well, you just give a call when</i>
<i>you're ready. I'll be waiting.</i>

01:06.721 --> 01:08.211
<i>Deleted.</i>

03:50.385 --> 03:53.286
You should stop smoking.

03:54.088 --> 03:56.750
It makes me mysterious.

03:56.858 --> 04:01.386
It makes you all wrinkly,
and your breath smells like ass.

04:01.563 --> 04:05.226
You are such a Girl Scout.

04:05.333 --> 04:08.268
They should give you
the Golden Virgin Merit Badge.

04:21.983 --> 04:23.280
- What's up, Sarah?
- Hey, Chris.

04:23.451 --> 04:24.975
Where's Jillian at?

04:25.086 --> 04:26.553
She's in back.

04:26.654 --> 04:28.781
Hey, J, come on out a sec!

04:28.890 --> 04:30.983
J, I want to talk to you!

04:31.092 --> 04:32.525
Hey, hey!
There's no shouting in here.

04:33.928 --> 04:35.555
What a life.

04:35.663 --> 04:38.154
Isn't there a bag of reefer
someplace with your name on it?

04:38.266 --> 04:39.233
Jillian, would you get out here?

04:39.334 --> 04:42.167
I can't get any work done
with these guys...

04:42.270 --> 04:43.794
Just stand still.

04:43.905 --> 04:48.035
Ooh, Mr. P.
I love a man who takes control.

04:48.142 --> 04:49.268
Seriously, J,

04:49.377 --> 04:51.504
is there anything with two legs
that you <i>wouldn't</i> rub up on?

04:51.613 --> 04:54.275
Yeah, Billy. You.

05:01.723 --> 05:02.712
What do you want, Billy?

05:02.824 --> 05:05.952
Oh, I just came by to, uh,
invite you to a little party

05:06.060 --> 05:08.324
that we're throwing tomorrow night
over at Chris' garage.

05:08.429 --> 05:09.453
You should come, too.

05:10.798 --> 05:12.322
Ooh.

05:12.433 --> 05:15.493
A group grope
at the garage... classy.

05:15.603 --> 05:18.003
Well, you always liked them before.

05:18.106 --> 05:19.698
When I was younger.

05:19.807 --> 05:21.707
I've grown up.
I'm more mature now.

05:21.809 --> 05:23.208
Huh.

05:23.311 --> 05:25.609
Well, something on you
has definitely matured.

05:29.484 --> 05:31.918
Too bad that's not the case
with your little dick.

05:32.020 --> 05:33.715
Ooh!

05:33.821 --> 05:36.346
That's funny.
I never heard you complain.

05:36.457 --> 05:37.890
I didn't have time.

05:37.992 --> 05:39.960
You know what, J?

05:40.061 --> 05:41.187
I just came by to be nice...

05:41.295 --> 05:44.924
...you know, show you
no hard feelings.

05:45.033 --> 05:50.801
But you are being such a bitch.

05:50.905 --> 05:54.102
That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

06:06.788 --> 06:09.279
Seriously, you could be
a little nicer.

06:27.742 --> 06:29.334
You are so gonna get fired.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.139
<i>Sarah?</i>

06:33.347 --> 06:34.177
Your mom called,

06:34.282 --> 06:37.547
and she said that she has to work late
and you should pick up dinner.

06:37.652 --> 06:39.517
Again?

06:40.688 --> 06:42.918
Yeah. Thanks.

06:44.092 --> 06:46.822
To parents...

06:51.966 --> 06:52.955
What?

06:54.936 --> 06:55.994
You want some?

06:56.637 --> 06:58.264
Come on.
Don't be such a pussy.

06:58.372 --> 06:59.430
Leave her alone.

07:10.084 --> 07:11.847
So, do you want to go?

07:11.953 --> 07:12.885
To what?

07:12.987 --> 07:14.750
The garage?

07:14.856 --> 07:16.881
Why?

07:16.991 --> 07:19.721
Oh, my God!
You're into Chris?

07:20.528 --> 07:23.429
Take it from me... you don't
want to hang with those guys.

07:23.531 --> 07:24.463
You do.

07:24.565 --> 07:25.827
I know how to handle them.

07:25.933 --> 07:27.332
So come with me, then.

07:27.435 --> 07:29.062
Protect me.

07:29.170 --> 07:30.797
I can't.

07:30.905 --> 07:33.271
I have a previous engagement.

07:33.374 --> 07:36.571
I thought you were done
with local boys.

07:36.677 --> 07:37.439
Who is it?

07:39.814 --> 07:41.111
My cyber-boyfriend.

07:41.215 --> 07:42.682
Come on. Cut the shit.
Who is it?

07:42.784 --> 07:45.548
Seriously.
We met on the Internet.

07:46.554 --> 07:48.681
- Ser... Jillian?
- What?

07:49.991 --> 07:51.356
You've got to step into the future.

07:51.459 --> 07:53.518
There's like
50 million people doing it.

07:53.628 --> 07:56.961
Besides, the local talent pool
is way too fucking shallow.

07:57.064 --> 07:59.362
- Still...
- "Still" what?

07:59.467 --> 08:01.697
Are you afraid I'm gonna end up
like Janet Melville?

08:01.869 --> 08:03.632
Just vanish one night,

08:03.738 --> 08:06.206
leaving the Goshen soccer moms
without their favorite babysitter?

08:06.307 --> 08:09.572
The Goshen soccer moms
would be psyched if you left town!

08:10.545 --> 08:11.603
Yeah. No shit, right?

08:11.712 --> 08:14.647
It'd be safe
to let their sons out again.

08:30.865 --> 08:32.389
What is this about?

08:32.500 --> 08:34.195
Could we use the computer
at your place?

08:34.302 --> 08:37.032
Well, we can, but Big Brother's
gonna be watching.

08:37.138 --> 08:39.038
You don't have a brother.

08:39.140 --> 08:41.073
I mean my mom put this spyware
on the computer that...

08:41.174 --> 08:43.769
Screw that.

08:48.349 --> 08:49.338
Wait a minute.

08:49.984 --> 08:51.884
I think we have our answer.

08:52.587 --> 08:54.316
No, Jillian. Don't.

08:54.422 --> 08:55.650
Don't be so weird. Don't...

08:55.756 --> 08:56.381
Hey!

08:56.490 --> 08:57.422
<i>Jasper!</i>

08:58.192 --> 08:58.851
Come here.

09:01.462 --> 09:03.657
Time to take one for the team.

09:08.169 --> 09:09.227
Hello, ladies.

09:09.337 --> 09:11.202
We're having
some technical difficulties.

09:11.305 --> 09:13.273
Let me take a look at that.

09:17.378 --> 09:18.367
Oh, yeah.

09:18.479 --> 09:21.243
Yeah, you can't log onto this site
with the library computers anymore.

09:21.349 --> 09:22.145
Why not?

09:22.250 --> 09:24.741
Some parents' group
created all this drama over it

09:24.852 --> 09:27.286
and said it was like
a grocery store for child molesters.

09:27.388 --> 09:29.549
You know,
"too much mature content."

09:30.791 --> 09:32.884
But I bet... you have the password.

09:32.994 --> 09:33.790
Well, of course.

09:34.562 --> 09:35.859
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

09:35.963 --> 09:37.191
Look, I could get fired.

09:37.999 --> 09:40.126
Come on, Jas. Please?
Just this once?

09:40.234 --> 09:42.828
Please?

09:43.671 --> 09:46.504
You can't tell anyone.

09:48.609 --> 09:52.511
There. And please, don't let
anyone see what you're doing.

09:52.613 --> 09:53.944
Thanks, Jas.

09:54.048 --> 09:55.310
Yeah, thanks, Jas.

09:56.450 --> 09:57.417
Oh! Excuse me.

09:57.518 --> 09:58.917
<i>You're so...</i>

09:59.020 --> 10:00.612
<i>You're such a bitch.</i>
No, he doesn't.

10:00.721 --> 10:02.348
What? He so totally does.

10:02.456 --> 10:04.686
Trust me, all right?
I have a knack...

10:05.760 --> 10:06.852
...for men.

10:06.961 --> 10:09.930
Okay, if that's
what you want to call it.

10:10.031 --> 10:11.794
What are you looking at?

10:11.899 --> 10:12.888
Nothing.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.194
Bullshit.

10:18.439 --> 10:21.306
- Oh, my God! Is that you?
- Shh!

10:21.409 --> 10:23.434
Holy shit! That <i>is</i> you!

10:23.544 --> 10:25.478
- Jillian, what are you doing?
- <i>Would you keep it down?</i>

10:25.579 --> 10:27.206
You look like such a slut!

10:27.315 --> 10:28.782
What the fuck?
Would you keep it down?

10:28.883 --> 10:30.180
Are you even wearing anything?

10:30.284 --> 10:31.444
Sort of.

10:31.552 --> 10:33.782
Oh, my God! That's crazy!

10:33.888 --> 10:35.480
Oh, please. This is nothing.

10:35.589 --> 10:38.524
I've seen pictures of guys,
like, totally grabbing their dicks

10:38.626 --> 10:40.116
and chicks like showing their bush.

10:40.227 --> 10:42.457
Dude, why are you doing this?

10:42.563 --> 10:44.690
I told you.
To meet men.

10:44.799 --> 10:48.030
Well...
It looks like it's working.

10:48.135 --> 10:49.295
What is this?

10:49.403 --> 10:51.200
You love to snowboard?

10:51.305 --> 10:54.069
I would if I had the chance.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.972
Besides, men don't care
if you lie to them,

10:56.077 --> 10:58.568
as long as they like
the lie that you're telling.

10:59.246 --> 11:00.907
Oh, my God.
Look at this guy.

11:01.015 --> 11:04.746
The "dumb show"? Yeah, he hits
my inbox like a couple times a week.

11:04.919 --> 11:06.181
And that, seriously,
doesn't freak you out?

11:06.287 --> 11:09.051
All these random guys
can just look at you half-naked.

11:09.156 --> 11:10.418
That's the point.

11:11.058 --> 11:13.253
Besides, it's not
like they know who I am.

11:13.361 --> 11:15.386
And once you spend
enough time on this thing,

11:15.496 --> 11:18.761
you can tell pretty quickly who's
being real and who's just a player.

11:20.001 --> 11:21.969
- Oh, come on.
- Come on. I'm bored.

11:22.069 --> 11:23.331
Want to get out of here?

11:23.437 --> 11:26.065
- No. I have to train.
- Oh.

11:26.173 --> 11:27.037
You want to come?

11:27.708 --> 11:30.472
Um...

11:30.578 --> 11:31.977
Track star...

11:32.079 --> 11:34.240
...porn star.

11:34.348 --> 11:35.747
No way.

11:56.037 --> 11:57.937
<i>Hey, hon.</i>

11:58.873 --> 12:01.273
What a day.

12:03.844 --> 12:05.106
What's for dinner?

12:05.212 --> 12:06.770
From the Point.

12:06.881 --> 12:09.782
Penguin Point.

12:13.621 --> 12:16.385
How was your day today?

12:16.490 --> 12:18.185
It was fine.

12:18.993 --> 12:20.790
Sarah...

12:20.895 --> 12:23.056
...I know I haven't been
around a lot recently,

12:23.164 --> 12:25.962
but as soon as this case is finished,
I'm gonna have more time.

12:26.067 --> 12:27.864
Mmm-hm.

12:30.671 --> 12:32.901
Speaking of which...

12:33.007 --> 12:37.273
I have to finalize my travel plans
for the deposition next week.

12:37.378 --> 12:39.312
You sure you're gonna be okay
staying by yourself?

12:39.413 --> 12:41.904
Mom, I'll be fine.

12:45.986 --> 12:47.920
Your father said he could take you.

12:48.622 --> 12:50.556
Dad's, like, three hours away.

12:50.658 --> 12:52.558
I'm old enough to take care of myself.

12:55.129 --> 12:57.256
I guess that's what scares me.

13:19.453 --> 13:20.715
<i>Oh, you and Chris</i>

13:20.821 --> 13:22.846
<i>make such a cute couple.</i>

13:30.498 --> 13:32.625
What's going on?

13:32.733 --> 13:35.167
Batty Patty Melville strikes again.

13:35.269 --> 13:38.830
So, I was thinking, you know,
just in case she stopped by

13:38.939 --> 13:41.134
to have one of those
things she loved,

13:41.242 --> 13:43.301
one of those...
oh, whatchamacallem... those...

13:43.410 --> 13:45.640
Malteds, Patty.
She liked the malteds.

13:45.746 --> 13:47.475
Yeah, the malteds.
She loved those.

13:47.581 --> 13:51.142
Anyways, I thought maybe if you put
one next to the register when she...

13:51.252 --> 13:55.552
Janet hasn't been in here
in over 5 years.

13:55.656 --> 13:56.884
Yeah.

13:58.025 --> 14:02.223
Anyways, I, I, I just thought
just in case she gets a craving...

14:02.396 --> 14:05.229
...if you put one...
- All right. All right. I'll take it.

14:05.332 --> 14:06.924
But then you have to go!

14:17.511 --> 14:20.036
What's wrong with her?

14:20.147 --> 14:23.048
Losing a child
does things to a person.

14:23.150 --> 14:27.280
If you ask me, the booze did it to her
a long time before that.

14:27.388 --> 14:30.289
Oh, my. I've got to get
back to the bank.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.018
So soon?

14:34.762 --> 14:37.993
Honey, I'll see you tonight.

14:38.098 --> 14:39.531
Here, will you get rid of this thing?

14:39.633 --> 14:41.294
That picture always
gives me the creeps.

15:11.131 --> 15:12.029
La, la, la la!

15:12.132 --> 15:14.396
- Candi! I want to use the computer!
- Good afternoon, Ma'am.

15:14.501 --> 15:15.399
My name is Margaret,

15:15.502 --> 15:18.266
and I'm a certified
lifestyle counselor with Endura Life,

15:18.372 --> 15:21.398
a company dedicated
to enhancing your everyday life

15:21.508 --> 15:23.476
with all-natural herbal products.

15:23.577 --> 15:24.976
According to our database,

15:25.079 --> 15:29.015
you've expressed interest in our
Megaboost Bust Enhancement...

15:30.017 --> 15:33.316
And fuck you, too,
you flat-chested bitch!

15:33.420 --> 15:34.785
We want to use the computer.

15:35.489 --> 15:37.389
How many times do I got to tell you

15:37.491 --> 15:41.427
not to come charging in here making
your noise when I'm on the phone?

15:41.528 --> 15:42.495
We want to use the computer.

15:43.430 --> 15:47.389
And I want a daughter
who can follow a few simple rules,

15:47.501 --> 15:50.902
but don't look like neither one of us
is gonna get what we want.

15:53.907 --> 15:54.896
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

15:55.009 --> 15:56.704
Hold on there a second, Sunshine.

15:56.810 --> 16:00.143
We've got a little matter
of last month's phone bill to discuss.

16:01.081 --> 16:03.276
Don't you roll your eyes at me.

16:03.450 --> 16:07.819
You went over $300 last month
on text messages.

16:07.921 --> 16:12.187
What in the fucking world do you
have to say that is worth $300?

16:12.293 --> 16:13.419
I've got lots of stuff.

16:13.527 --> 16:15.518
Well, I've got lots to say about that!

16:15.629 --> 16:17.688
Every penny
you spend on that phone

16:17.798 --> 16:20.926
is a penny that don't go
towards our bills.

16:21.035 --> 16:23.299
My disability
only goes so far, Jillian.

16:23.404 --> 16:26.066
Well, then stop watching
all them pay-per-views.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.900
I make my own money!
I pay my own bills! So fuck you!

16:30.010 --> 16:32.001
You ungrateful little bitch!

16:37.384 --> 16:38.248
Hello. Endura Life.

16:38.352 --> 16:42.083
This is certified lifestyle counselor
Margaret speaking.

16:54.101 --> 16:56.831
Did you read my journal, you beast?

16:56.937 --> 16:59.804
<i>I tried,</i>
<i>but your handwriting is for shit!</i>

16:59.907 --> 17:02.273
She's such a fucking bitch.

17:02.443 --> 17:03.410
I hate her.

17:03.510 --> 17:05.272
I hate it here!

17:05.378 --> 17:08.405
Fuck it! I just...
I, I fucking hate it.

17:16.223 --> 17:20.489
It's such a fucking dump.

17:32.639 --> 17:34.231
You want to know a secret?

17:45.519 --> 17:47.384
Is this my old suitcase?

17:47.855 --> 17:50.119
Found it in the trash.
I figured you didn't need it.

17:50.224 --> 17:51.452
What do you need it for?

17:52.526 --> 17:53.788
Getting out.

17:56.029 --> 17:58.896
Going elsewhere.

17:59.733 --> 18:01.633
As in anywhere else but here.

18:09.009 --> 18:13.002
Yeah, I know what you mean.
It sucks here.

18:13.113 --> 18:17.209
What do you know
about sucks, Girl Scout?

18:18.719 --> 18:23.418
You've got a great home.
Your mom's great.

18:25.893 --> 18:29.021
You're set.

18:59.827 --> 19:02.796
How do you get that stuff, anyway?

19:02.963 --> 19:04.624
Same as everyone else.

19:04.731 --> 19:07.097
It's my mom's.

19:07.201 --> 19:12.264
It's "medicinal,"
for her "disability."

19:14.575 --> 19:17.066
Yeah, what exactly <i>is</i> her disability?

19:18.045 --> 19:21.446
It changes a lot.

19:24.985 --> 19:26.247
What is that?

19:26.353 --> 19:29.914
Is that new?
Oh, come on. Let me see.

19:31.191 --> 19:31.782
What is that?

19:33.093 --> 19:35.561
It's like a totally hard-core,
goth-rocker snake.

19:37.431 --> 19:40.229
- I think it's cool as shit.
- Where did you get it?

19:42.703 --> 19:45.069
Did you steal it?

19:45.172 --> 19:47.333
No.

19:47.441 --> 19:49.500
It was a present.

19:49.610 --> 19:52.204
From who?

19:53.447 --> 19:56.575
Oh, come on! Don't give me
any of that "secret admirer" bullshit!

19:56.683 --> 19:58.207
What?

19:58.819 --> 20:01.811
Fuck. Fine, suit yourself.

20:03.390 --> 20:04.721
What's his name?

20:05.893 --> 20:07.986
I call him "Mr. X."

20:09.162 --> 20:10.993
- What?
- Gross!

20:11.098 --> 20:14.067
Well, if I knew all about him, he
wouldn't be a very "secret" admirer.

20:14.167 --> 20:15.464
Do you know anything about him?

20:15.569 --> 20:17.560
He's romantic.

20:19.540 --> 20:21.269
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

20:21.375 --> 20:23.070
What are you girls doing tonight?

20:23.176 --> 20:25.667
- Nothing.
- Really?

20:25.779 --> 20:30.113
Looks like we're doing
a little drinking and...

20:32.119 --> 20:34.679
...smoking contraband.

20:35.389 --> 20:37.949
- It's medicinal.
- What's your disease?

20:38.125 --> 20:39.422
Stupidity?

20:39.993 --> 20:42.257
All right.
Both you girls on your feet.

20:42.362 --> 20:44.125
We're going to the station.

20:45.666 --> 20:47.634
Take it easy, Patrick.

20:48.435 --> 20:49.459
Do I know you?

20:49.570 --> 20:50.798
Not yet.

20:50.904 --> 20:54.601
But I know you, Officer Gunshow.

20:57.945 --> 21:00.505
Nice tattoo.

21:01.982 --> 21:05.042
Now, let me see if I remember...

21:05.218 --> 21:08.984
You only listen to classic rock
'cause Emo's for pussies,

21:09.089 --> 21:11.580
<i>Point Break</i> is your favorite movie,

21:11.692 --> 21:17.494
and you think my body
is so freakin' hot.

21:17.598 --> 21:19.429
Right.

21:23.704 --> 21:26.798
Well, maybe we can
make this problem go away.

21:26.907 --> 21:29.273
Really? What did you have in mind?

21:31.345 --> 21:32.471
An arrangement.

21:32.579 --> 21:33.944
An arrangement?

21:34.114 --> 21:39.518
Exchange a night in you
for a night in jail.

21:50.931 --> 21:53.832
Gross!
I don't think so.

21:54.501 --> 21:57.698
No, I have a better idea.

21:57.804 --> 22:00.773
You forget you ever saw us here,

22:00.874 --> 22:03.968
and I'll forget to tell Kathy
about your "exchange"

22:04.144 --> 22:06.635
when I see her tomorrow.

22:16.156 --> 22:18.716
I'm gonna let you two off
with a warning.

22:22.095 --> 22:24.928
I'll be watching you.

22:29.503 --> 22:33.530
I live for my fans, Pat!

22:56.963 --> 22:58.225
Hi, Mr. Tod.

22:58.331 --> 22:59.559
Oh, hi.

22:59.666 --> 23:00.928
Looking sharp today.

23:02.669 --> 23:04.830
Well, thank you.

23:05.806 --> 23:08.240
- Oh, excuse me.
- Bless you.

23:08.341 --> 23:10.036
Oh, yeah, thanks.

23:10.143 --> 23:12.839
That's, uh, strong perfume
you have on there.

23:13.380 --> 23:15.041
It's Negligence.

23:15.148 --> 23:15.978
Do you like it?

23:16.083 --> 23:18.574
Daddy's allergic to smelly things.

23:18.685 --> 23:22.212
Cigarette smoke, cheap perfume.

23:22.322 --> 23:23.311
Huh, Daddy?

23:23.423 --> 23:26.221
Well, if the Lord had wanted us
to smell like flowers,

23:26.326 --> 23:28.988
he'd have given us petals.

23:30.163 --> 23:31.630
I think we'd better go, don't you?

23:31.732 --> 23:33.359
- Yep. All set.
- Okay.

23:33.467 --> 23:35.628
Where are you going?

23:35.736 --> 23:38.671
Oh, every year we rent a cabin up
at the lake with my uncle's family.

23:38.772 --> 23:40.433
You should come up sometime.

23:40.540 --> 23:41.632
You'd really love it.

23:41.742 --> 23:45.838
Oh, yeah. We have
lots of room and bunk beds. It's nice.

23:46.646 --> 23:48.671
Okay.

23:53.854 --> 23:55.583
Lucky.

23:55.689 --> 23:57.418
You get to be bunkies
with the mole girl.

23:57.524 --> 23:59.515
Yeah, shut up.

23:59.626 --> 24:01.116
Maybe her daddy will tuck you in.

24:01.228 --> 24:03.423
You're twisted.

24:05.365 --> 24:07.196
Oh, man.

24:07.300 --> 24:11.168
This place is so dead.

24:11.271 --> 24:13.068
Will you close up without me?

24:13.173 --> 24:13.935
I want to go get ready.

24:14.040 --> 24:17.339
For what?

24:17.444 --> 24:19.503
Oh, right.

24:19.613 --> 24:23.105
Tonight's the big night, and
that's why you're wearing perfume.

24:23.216 --> 24:25.650
It's his favorite.

24:25.752 --> 24:26.684
Come on.

24:27.788 --> 24:30.313
Come on! Let me go!
Please?

24:30.423 --> 24:34.325
- Okay, fine. Fine.
- Thank you. Thank you.

24:34.427 --> 24:38.955
Oh... And a piece of advice...

24:44.704 --> 24:47.969
don't.

24:48.074 --> 24:52.977
Oh, and one more thing...

24:54.781 --> 24:56.078
What is this for?

24:56.183 --> 24:58.708
<i>So that he'll ask you</i>
<i>to go for a walk.</i>

25:26.847 --> 25:29.714
Spare us some change
to prevent teenage delinquency?

25:31.251 --> 25:34.186
Well, thank you for your support.

25:43.196 --> 25:45.255
Hey, Chris.

25:45.365 --> 25:47.731
Hey.

25:47.834 --> 25:50.098
Hey, Sarah.
What's going on, girl?

25:50.203 --> 25:52.330
- You're looking good tonight!
- Thanks!

25:52.439 --> 25:54.066
Yeah, I almost didn't even come.

25:54.174 --> 25:56.438
Well, I am glad you did.

25:56.543 --> 25:58.340
You can never have enough
hot chicks at a party, right?

25:59.145 --> 26:02.012
Especially around here.

26:02.115 --> 26:05.209
Some of the girls in this town
make the livestock look tempting.

26:07.420 --> 26:09.718
- Have another beer, Jonas.
- Don't mind if I do.

26:09.823 --> 26:11.484
Cheers!

26:16.129 --> 26:17.426
What's that fool doing here?

26:17.530 --> 26:19.054
Hey!

26:19.165 --> 26:22.532
Hey, Ass-per!
What's up?

26:22.636 --> 26:24.570
Did you bring your, uh,
Computer Club buddies with you?

26:24.671 --> 26:25.797
No. No, I didn't.

26:25.906 --> 26:29.034
Did you bring your brain,
Cro-Magnon?

26:30.143 --> 26:32.202
Yeah. Hey, cheers.

26:34.481 --> 26:37.848
Uh, what are you gonna be,
like, a junior this year?

26:37.951 --> 26:38.645
Senior.

26:38.752 --> 26:40.947
Senior. Nice.

26:41.054 --> 26:43.545
So, does that make you, uh, legal?

26:45.725 --> 26:47.625
That depends.

26:47.727 --> 26:48.659
On what?

26:49.596 --> 26:52.292
On what you want to do.

26:57.037 --> 26:59.870
Uh...

26:59.973 --> 27:01.270
...let's go for a walk.

27:19.693 --> 27:21.456
All gone.

27:22.128 --> 27:26.462
I can give you some of mine, but I
never share my beer on the first date.

27:26.566 --> 27:28.431
First date?

27:28.535 --> 27:31.299
Well, I invited you,
you came.

27:31.404 --> 27:33.634
Sounds like a date to me.

27:33.740 --> 27:37.437
You want to know why I invited you?

27:37.544 --> 27:39.842
Because I think you're
the best-looking girl in town.

27:39.946 --> 27:41.174
Come on!

27:41.281 --> 27:42.908
Seriously.

27:43.016 --> 27:48.648
You're much better-looking
than all your friends. No doubt.

28:10.410 --> 28:11.206
Come on!

28:14.214 --> 28:15.909
Your hands are cold.

28:16.016 --> 28:19.042
Then let's warm them up.

28:20.487 --> 28:21.010
Come on!

28:21.121 --> 28:22.383
- You'll like it.
- Stop.

28:22.489 --> 28:23.513
I promise.

28:23.623 --> 28:25.113
Like what?

28:25.225 --> 28:25.953
The party?

28:26.059 --> 28:28.289
It's fuckin' raging, isn't it?

28:28.395 --> 28:29.794
Get out of here, Ass-per.

28:29.896 --> 28:31.921
Hey, hey.
And where are your drinks?

28:32.032 --> 28:33.431
You want to share mine?

28:34.134 --> 28:35.101
Sorry.

28:39.139 --> 28:42.074
This is way too much work
to get laid.

28:43.910 --> 28:45.434
...fucking manipulated!

28:45.545 --> 28:48.742
You like seeing mad in me?
You're fucking evil!

28:48.848 --> 28:50.941
And I'm fucking worth it!
Fuck you!

28:51.051 --> 28:52.848
You know what?
I actually gave a fuck about you!

28:52.952 --> 28:54.613
I actually cared about you!

28:54.721 --> 28:56.746
You're fucking begging me!

28:56.856 --> 28:58.016
J...

29:01.094 --> 29:02.755
You want to be a fucking bitch, huh?

29:02.929 --> 29:04.590
Listen to me.
Look at me, look at me.

29:04.998 --> 29:05.487
Look at me.

29:05.598 --> 29:06.565
What the fuck
are you gonna do, huh?

29:06.733 --> 29:09.065
Oh!
- Asshole!

29:09.169 --> 29:12.138
Ouch. Oh, what was that about?

29:12.238 --> 29:14.331
Hey, why did you run off like that?
Are you okay?

29:14.441 --> 29:15.066
Oh, yeah.

29:15.175 --> 29:18.269
Ugh!
- I'm fine.

29:18.378 --> 29:20.846
Um...

29:20.947 --> 29:22.812
...thank you.
Thank you for doing that.

29:22.916 --> 29:24.440
Yeah, sure. No problem.

30:18.004 --> 30:20.529
<i>Shh, shh, shh.</i>

30:40.593 --> 30:43.153
You are such a Girl Scout.

30:43.263 --> 30:46.096
...a child does things to a person.

31:28.575 --> 31:30.839
<i>Hi. You've reached the bitch.</i>

31:30.944 --> 31:33.174
<i>Leave it at the beep, freaks.</i>

31:41.287 --> 31:42.652
Hey, Sarah.

31:42.755 --> 31:43.983
Tell your friend when she wakes up,

31:44.090 --> 31:48.356
she doesn't get paid for the day
if she doesn't work.

31:57.971 --> 32:00.201
<i>Hi. You've reached the bitch.</i>

32:00.306 --> 32:03.036
<i>Leave it at the beep, freaks.</i>

32:13.453 --> 32:15.080
<i>That's right.
It was the best.</i>

32:15.188 --> 32:18.282
<i>The manufacturers</i>
<i>have decided to make this...</i>

32:18.391 --> 32:21.952
What the hell do you want?

32:23.730 --> 32:26.631
<i>... 7 or 8,000. Not 5 or 6 or 4.</i>

32:26.733 --> 32:28.701
<i>Not even 3,000.</i>
<i>Can you guess how many?</i>

32:29.502 --> 32:32.938
<i>This edition is gonna</i>
<i>be limited to only 2,500.</i>

32:33.039 --> 32:35.633
<i>That's right. Those 2,500...</i>

32:35.742 --> 32:39.769
You looking for Miss Sunshine?

32:39.879 --> 32:41.744
Well, she sure as hell ain't here!

32:43.149 --> 32:47.176
Hasn't been around here
since Friday.

32:47.287 --> 32:48.754
Figured she was holed up
at your place.

32:48.855 --> 32:50.823
Always seemed to prefer it anyways.

32:52.225 --> 32:54.455
So you don't know
where she is at all, then?

32:54.994 --> 32:59.055
Don't know. Don't care.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.358
She sent me a message...

33:02.468 --> 33:06.234
"I'm fine. Don't bother coming
looking for me," or some such shit.

33:06.406 --> 33:10.900
Couldn't even bother to speak
to me herself, the little... bitch.

33:15.682 --> 33:17.809
Mind shutting that door?
You're putting a glare on the tube.

33:20.853 --> 33:23.913
Next time you talk
to that little tramp...

33:24.023 --> 33:29.825
you tell her she better pray
my cable don't get disconnected.

33:31.064 --> 33:34.090
I was talking all this shit...

33:34.200 --> 33:36.532
you know, like, "Oh, I've been
paintballing for, like, seven years"

33:36.636 --> 33:37.261
or whatever.

33:37.370 --> 33:38.462
Got out there, right?

33:38.571 --> 33:39.799
He had no clue what he was doing.

33:39.972 --> 33:43.840
- We fucking lit him up...
- Hey, Billy?

33:43.943 --> 33:46.207
...and he totally deserved it because
he was such a pussy, this guy.

33:46.312 --> 33:48.405
- Hey, Billy?
- Just like "pop, pop, pop, pop"!

33:48.514 --> 33:49.344
Billy.

33:52.552 --> 33:53.280
What?

33:53.386 --> 33:54.944
I want to ask you a question.

33:57.623 --> 34:00.683
Yeah, well, as you can see,
I'm with my customers right now,

34:00.793 --> 34:02.021
so you have to come back
another time.

34:02.128 --> 34:04.653
When was the last time
you saw Jill?

34:04.831 --> 34:05.855
You know, I don't,

34:05.965 --> 34:07.830
I don't really keep track
of the bitches. Sorry.

34:08.701 --> 34:10.998
Oh, and Chris called.

34:11.103 --> 34:14.471
He said he had a <i>really</i> good time
with you on Friday.

34:14.574 --> 34:15.905
You know, if I got
my ass kicked by a girl,

34:16.007 --> 34:17.373
I'd probably want
to forget about it, too.

34:23.916 --> 34:27.851
You guys want to do me a favor
and come back for these tomorrow?

34:27.954 --> 34:29.080
Thanks.

34:33.126 --> 34:35.650
So, I saw her at the party.

34:35.762 --> 34:37.059
So what?

34:37.163 --> 34:38.926
So, nobody's heard from her since.

34:39.031 --> 34:42.592
Yeah, well,
I really couldn't give a shit.

34:42.702 --> 34:43.726
Come to think of it...

34:45.571 --> 34:47.937
...why do you?
- She's my best friend.

34:48.040 --> 34:52.670
Hmm. J doesn't have friends.
She has victims.

34:54.380 --> 34:57.440
Hey, you know, J always
talked a lot of mess about you.

34:57.550 --> 34:59.518
Did you know that?

34:59.619 --> 35:02.019
She said you were gonna bail out
on her the first chance you got.

35:02.121 --> 35:03.645
That is so not true.

35:03.823 --> 35:05.654
You're just pissed
because she dumped you.

35:05.758 --> 35:07.817
Oh, ho, yeah.
For, uh, who was that?

35:07.927 --> 35:10.862
Oh, Mr. X, her imaginary friend?

35:11.464 --> 35:12.761
What?

35:12.865 --> 35:15.891
Do you think you're the only one
she told that little fairy tale to?

35:16.002 --> 35:17.560
Why would she
tell you that stuff, anyway?

35:17.670 --> 35:18.898
To be a bitch.

35:20.606 --> 35:22.972
Look, I couldn't really
begin to understand

35:23.075 --> 35:24.372
how that girl's mind works,

35:24.477 --> 35:26.274
and I don't care to.

35:26.379 --> 35:29.439
She's gone, and I'm glad.

35:48.034 --> 35:49.126
Hey, Darla?

35:51.471 --> 35:52.961
Can I show you something?

36:08.888 --> 36:10.378
What the heck was that?

36:11.858 --> 36:13.291
Jill sent it to me
the night of the party,

36:13.392 --> 36:16.418
and I haven't heard from her since.

36:16.529 --> 36:19.965
And I know that it's not like
she hasn't taken off before,

36:20.066 --> 36:22.591
but something really
doesn't feel right, you know?

36:22.702 --> 36:24.226
I mean, we talk every day.

36:26.606 --> 36:28.437
What about that bus?
Have you ever seen that before?

36:28.541 --> 36:30.941
No.

36:32.645 --> 36:36.604
She is the type, isn't she?

36:38.117 --> 36:39.379
That goes missing?

36:39.485 --> 36:41.385
Like Janet Melville.

36:41.487 --> 36:42.852
But, Darla,
nothing happened to Janet.

36:42.955 --> 36:45.685
They just say that stuff to scare us
away from doing anything fun.

36:46.692 --> 36:51.391
Daddy said she probably ran off with
one of those guys she was sitting for.

36:51.497 --> 36:53.692
He said she had a reputation.

36:55.968 --> 36:59.495
That's why no one
bothered much to look for her.

37:33.639 --> 37:35.402
<i>The mailbox belonging</i> to...

37:35.508 --> 37:37.499
<i>the bitch...</i>
<i>is full and cannot...</i>

37:54.860 --> 37:56.623
- Creepy.
- Right?

37:56.729 --> 37:58.754
Look at this one.

37:58.864 --> 38:03.892
"Don't worry. Everything fine.
Call soon. Jillian."

38:04.070 --> 38:04.968
Yeah, what's so weird about that?

38:05.071 --> 38:06.095
She signs her name.

38:07.306 --> 38:09.501
Jillian hates her name.
She never signs with it.

38:09.609 --> 38:11.270
That really doesn't prove anything.

38:11.377 --> 38:12.901
I mean, someone
could just be messing with you.

38:13.646 --> 38:16.945
What about that bus?
Have you ever seen that?

38:17.049 --> 38:18.482
No. No.

38:18.584 --> 38:19.551
What does this mean?

38:21.787 --> 38:23.914
I don't... I don't know.

38:24.357 --> 38:26.621
Hold on a sec.

38:28.260 --> 38:29.591
What are you doing?

38:29.695 --> 38:30.923
I'm decoding your message.

38:31.030 --> 38:33.157
No, Jasper, we didn't write in code.

38:33.265 --> 38:35.563
Maybe not intentionally.
You know, Mom does this all the time.

38:35.668 --> 38:36.828
She sends me text messages

38:36.936 --> 38:39.131
thinking she's using
the enriched-text function.

38:41.374 --> 38:42.341
The T9 function?

38:43.976 --> 38:44.874
Like, when she really isn't,

38:44.977 --> 38:46.774
so what you end up with
aren't words you can read,

38:46.879 --> 38:48.847
but a jumble
of letters and numbers instead.

38:48.948 --> 38:52.782
So what I would do is write down
the letter combinations...

38:52.885 --> 38:56.651
...and then see
what words it would spell.

39:04.063 --> 39:05.928
What?

39:15.074 --> 39:16.336
Now do you believe me?

39:16.442 --> 39:18.842
You've got
to go to the cops with this.

39:34.694 --> 39:35.718
So?

39:37.196 --> 39:39.289
- "So" what?
- So, what do we do now?

39:41.200 --> 39:43.964
We don't do anything.

39:44.070 --> 39:45.537
But if her parents want to,

39:45.638 --> 39:49.039
they can come on down and fill out
a missing-person's report.

39:49.141 --> 39:51.803
Is her mom aware
that she's missing?

39:51.911 --> 39:53.811
Well, she's the one
you ought to be talking to.

39:53.913 --> 39:54.709
That's it?

39:56.048 --> 39:59.381
What about that message?
It says, "Help me."

39:59.485 --> 40:01.919
This is coincidence,
pure and simple.

40:02.655 --> 40:06.182
You look hard enough, you can
see the Virgin Mary in a tortilla.

40:07.293 --> 40:10.285
Look, you do a job like this
as long as I have,

40:10.396 --> 40:12.193
you come to find
that good police work

40:12.298 --> 40:13.788
is about keeping your eyes open.

40:14.567 --> 40:16.467
Your dog ends up dead.

40:16.569 --> 40:18.867
Ask the neighbor
he kept up all night with his barking.

40:18.971 --> 40:20.666
Money missing from the register...

40:20.773 --> 40:24.470
ask the cashier
with the expensive new shoes.

40:24.577 --> 40:26.670
Cause and effect.

40:26.779 --> 40:30.237
The world ain't as mysterious
as you think it is when you're a kid.

40:30.349 --> 40:32.476
I'm not a kid.

40:32.585 --> 40:37.784
My point is that a girl with a prior
history for running away...

40:37.890 --> 40:40.324
...who tells her friend...
- Her best friend!

40:41.327 --> 40:45.764
Who tells her best friend
that she's thinking on running away,

40:45.865 --> 40:47.890
even shows her the suitcase...

40:48.000 --> 40:50.525
...has probably done just that.
- I know Jill.

40:50.636 --> 40:51.830
This isn't like her.

40:51.937 --> 40:55.338
I've seen this happen
a hundred times before.

40:55.441 --> 40:59.468
Girl gets to be a certain age,
she feels pinched,

40:59.578 --> 41:02.638
like she's outgrown this place,
these people...

41:02.748 --> 41:04.010
You don't outgrow your best friend!

41:06.118 --> 41:08.951
That's all you have to say?
Come on!

41:09.054 --> 41:11.181
You don't think
there's something weird going on?

41:11.290 --> 41:13.190
Weird isn't a crime.

41:13.292 --> 41:18.195
If it were, I'd happily
put every one of you kids in jail.

41:22.935 --> 41:25.403
Well, what about rape?

41:27.206 --> 41:29.140
Isn't sex with a minor
still considered rape?

41:31.277 --> 41:31.709
I mean, what
was going through your head

41:31.811 --> 41:33.335
when you were writing her
all those e-mails?

41:33.445 --> 41:35.936
Better watch your tone, girl.

41:36.048 --> 41:37.743
You're preparing to jump
in the deep end.

41:37.850 --> 41:41.752
You don't have to run away
to the big city to find trouble.

41:41.854 --> 41:43.845
There's plenty right here.

42:19.158 --> 42:20.147
Tell me again why I'm risking

42:20.259 --> 42:22.625
my future full-ride scholarship
to Stanford to do this.

42:22.728 --> 42:24.525
Because the story
that Jillian ran away is bullshit,

42:24.630 --> 42:27.258
and you know it and I know it
and I need you to help me prove it

42:27.366 --> 42:28.697
and you like me.

42:38.510 --> 42:40.307
No shit!

42:40.412 --> 42:42.209
"Durtygrrl" was Jillian?

42:43.482 --> 42:45.643
What?
Everyone checked out her profile.

42:45.751 --> 42:48.345
She's the patron saint
of the Computer Club.

42:48.454 --> 42:50.615
Anyway, what does this have
to do with her going missing?

42:50.723 --> 42:53.191
The night she disappeared, Jill was
supposed to meet this cyber guy,

42:53.292 --> 42:54.725
and I think she met him here.

42:54.827 --> 42:59.230
Oh, if this really is the suspect,
you've got a huge job ahead of you.

43:06.238 --> 43:07.603
Hey, I didn't know, okay?

43:07.706 --> 43:09.697
Besides, you know how many hot girls
you have to hit up on here

43:09.808 --> 43:13.005
before you find one
that will actually add you?

43:15.214 --> 43:17.478
Looks like she was
everybody's friend.

43:17.583 --> 43:19.710
Or nobody's.

43:19.818 --> 43:23.413
Look, she hasn't logged in
since last Friday.

43:23.522 --> 43:25.717
The night of the party.

43:25.824 --> 43:28.725
Hey, check her e-mail!

43:31.430 --> 43:32.658
Maybe her middle name or her pet's.

43:32.765 --> 43:34.164
No, it wouldn't be something obvious.

43:34.266 --> 43:39.260
Her mom was always into her stuff,
so she wouldn't want her reading it.

43:42.641 --> 43:45.337
Where are you going?

44:10.936 --> 44:13.200
<i>... Tri-state area...</i>

44:17.676 --> 44:20.509
<i>Thanks again for being here.</i>
<i>I really appreciate it.</i>

44:34.093 --> 44:35.856
<i>Is that actually what they said?</i>

44:38.998 --> 44:42.661
<i>What is it? That's crazy!</i>
<i>What's wrong with this world?</i>

44:42.768 --> 44:44.668
<i>John, let's get a picture</i>
<i>up there, shall we?</i>

44:45.904 --> 44:46.802
<i>Okay. And the number please.</i>

44:46.905 --> 44:49.499
<i>Thanks. Thank you.</i>
<i>If you see Chelsea out there, folks,</i>

44:49.608 --> 44:52.441
<i>if you see her</i>
<i>or someone who looks like her,</i>

44:52.544 --> 44:55.172
<i>call that number anytime,</i>
<i>day or night.</i>

44:55.280 --> 44:58.044
<i>It's an anonymous number.</i>

44:58.150 --> 45:00.015
<i>But please, report,</i>
<i>whether or not you see her.</i>

45:00.119 --> 45:03.748
<i>Let's just get this little girl home.</i>

45:03.922 --> 45:05.617
<i>She really is a beautiful girl, Kelly.</i>

45:07.292 --> 45:08.725
<i>Folks, if you see Chelsea out there,</i>

45:08.827 --> 45:10.920
<i>you can call that number</i>
<i>anytime, day or night...</i>

47:34.706 --> 47:36.901
Hello?

47:38.977 --> 47:40.604
Hello!

48:16.348 --> 48:17.747
<i>You've reached the bitch.</i>

48:17.849 --> 48:20.943
<i>Leave it at the beep, freaks.</i>

48:21.053 --> 48:23.180
<i>Jill, this is all</i>
<i>getting really weird.</i>

48:23.288 --> 48:25.518
<i>Why won't you just call me back?</i>

48:25.624 --> 48:28.388
<i>If you're in some kind of trouble...</i>

48:28.493 --> 48:30.654
<i>Where are you?</i>

48:36.034 --> 48:39.265
Log on. I think I found it.

48:47.546 --> 48:48.843
Jesus!

48:48.947 --> 48:51.381
I don't think I've gotten 500 messages
my entire life!

48:51.483 --> 48:52.575
You don't have boobs, Jasper.

48:52.684 --> 48:53.708
Can you just look...

48:55.254 --> 48:57.950
...at the messages
she got on Friday?

48:58.056 --> 49:01.617
Yeah, that
whittles it down to, like, 200.

49:01.727 --> 49:04.287
Let me see.
It could be any one of these guys.

49:04.463 --> 49:07.091
Or none of them.
Half these guys are anonymous.

49:08.300 --> 49:12.134
There's not much to go on.

49:12.237 --> 49:15.638
Maybe we can get them
to tell us what the profiles don't.

49:15.741 --> 49:19.438
Can you send them <i>all</i> a message?

49:19.544 --> 49:23.412
Um... write,

49:23.515 --> 49:25.642
"Durtygrrl knows what you are."

49:29.221 --> 49:31.485
Nice... flirtatious, yet threatening.

49:31.590 --> 49:33.251
Just send it.

49:37.529 --> 49:39.463
I don't know.
Do you think it will work?

49:39.564 --> 49:43.432
I mean, if I just did something shady,
I would be way on the D.L.

49:43.535 --> 49:45.833
Maybe.

49:45.937 --> 49:47.700
But you'd have to be curious.

49:47.806 --> 49:51.298
Wouldn't you want to know
if you got away with it?

49:54.579 --> 49:58.640
You know, we really
haven't had much time to talk...

49:58.750 --> 50:01.514
...recently.

50:05.424 --> 50:10.862
I guess I feel a little strange
leaving you by yourself.

50:10.962 --> 50:13.487
I'm a big girl.
I'll be fine.

50:15.500 --> 50:17.229
God damn it!

50:17.336 --> 50:21.864
Honey, can you make sure the
raccoons aren't in the garbage again?

50:46.365 --> 50:49.163
Take it easy, now. Take it easy.

50:49.267 --> 50:51.462
You struggle too much,
you're liable to get hurt.

50:53.171 --> 50:55.139
<i>That's better.</i>

50:57.109 --> 51:01.011
Got a message from your friend.

51:01.113 --> 51:04.139
Seems like she's alive and well.

51:04.316 --> 51:09.413
Now, I don't know
what you think your game is,

51:09.521 --> 51:12.115
but you might
want to keep this in mind...

51:14.493 --> 51:16.859
A man's family is his castle.

51:18.530 --> 51:22.557
Invade his castle,
well, that's an act of war.

51:25.437 --> 51:28.770
Sarah? Everything okay?

51:28.874 --> 51:33.004
Sarah?

51:34.045 --> 51:36.013
I'll be watching you.

51:37.582 --> 51:39.641
Sarah?

51:39.751 --> 51:41.810
Sarah?

51:57.569 --> 51:58.695
Honey, time to get up.

52:00.639 --> 52:02.368
Come on! Get your clothes on.

52:02.474 --> 52:05.568
You have to drive me
to the airport, remember?

52:05.744 --> 52:06.870
I'm surprised
your phone didn't wake you.

52:06.978 --> 52:08.502
It's been beeping all night.

52:36.341 --> 52:37.501
<i>When you guys finish,</i>

52:37.609 --> 52:39.042
<i>I need someone up here on the floor.</i>

52:39.144 --> 52:40.941
Okay.

52:43.081 --> 52:44.742
Well, what do you
want to do with these?

52:57.929 --> 53:00.227
I thought you were
morally opposed to cigarettes.

53:00.332 --> 53:02.994
Daddy says they are a dirty habit.

53:06.638 --> 53:08.469
What's it like
just living with your dad?

53:09.875 --> 53:13.333
It's all right.

53:13.445 --> 53:15.504
It used to be more fun
before Mom died.

53:18.650 --> 53:19.446
What happened?

53:20.852 --> 53:24.310
Complications in childbirth.

53:26.157 --> 53:27.181
With my baby brother.

53:27.292 --> 53:29.658
After that, Dad got really strict,

53:29.761 --> 53:33.697
and now I have lots of rules on...

53:33.798 --> 53:37.632
...the Internet and makeup and stuff.

53:37.736 --> 53:38.862
Yeah.

53:42.307 --> 53:43.865
Oh, heck!

53:43.975 --> 53:45.408
There's my dad. He's coming.

53:46.111 --> 53:46.634
Don't panic. Don't panic.
It's fine.

53:46.745 --> 53:48.975
- Um, spray some of this on.
- No! I can't wear perfume!

53:49.080 --> 53:50.980
Darla, do you want your dad
thinking that you're wearing perfume

53:51.082 --> 53:51.810
or smoking?

53:54.019 --> 53:56.579
Uh, okay, hit me...

53:57.122 --> 53:58.316
Vince!

53:58.423 --> 54:01.256
Darla, ring up your dad, will you?

54:01.359 --> 54:02.348
Take it easy.

54:03.495 --> 54:06.589
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.

54:06.765 --> 54:08.824
Hi, Sarah.

54:08.934 --> 54:10.925
I notice you've been down
to the library quite a bit lately.

54:11.036 --> 54:12.833
Are you in summer school?

54:12.938 --> 54:16.203
No, um... It's like
a personal research project.

54:17.709 --> 54:19.404
- Oh.
- These are $5.30.

54:19.511 --> 54:21.843
- Okay. All right. There you go.
- Thank you.

54:22.514 --> 54:25.711
- Have you heard from your friend?
- My friend?

54:25.817 --> 54:30.413
Yes, the, uh, the young lady
who was working here. Jillian?

54:31.556 --> 54:33.183
No, uh, not yet.

54:33.892 --> 54:36.554
I'm sure she'll turn up.
Thanks.

54:38.530 --> 54:41.795
All right. Bye, honey.

54:41.900 --> 54:43.731
You're not wearing perfume, are you?

54:43.835 --> 54:45.803
Oh, no, um, that's me.

54:45.904 --> 54:50.773
I think I, I think I was standing
next to her when I sprayed it on.

54:51.910 --> 54:53.639
Okay.

54:53.745 --> 54:56.043
All right.
I'll see you later tonight.

54:57.182 --> 54:57.876
Hey, Daddy?

54:59.384 --> 55:02.182
I invited Sarah over to our house
for my birthday.

55:05.557 --> 55:07.889
Good! Good!

55:07.993 --> 55:09.984
Well, we'll have
a good time, won't we?

55:10.095 --> 55:13.189
It'll be a nice party.
Okay.

55:16.501 --> 55:19.732
Thanks for covering for me!
You will come, won't you?

55:19.838 --> 55:21.328
This Sunday.

55:21.439 --> 55:23.839
I'm sorry about telling him
about the Jillian thing.

55:23.942 --> 55:25.671
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- Oh, it's okay.

55:25.777 --> 55:29.873
Um, yeah, of course I'll come.
It'll be really fun.

55:40.025 --> 55:41.117
Any bites?

55:42.460 --> 55:44.985
Are you gonna read all those?

55:47.065 --> 55:48.396
Well, better get started!

56:16.661 --> 56:18.128
Thought you could use a boost.

56:18.229 --> 56:21.289
- Just hook up an I.V.
- What, boring?

56:22.100 --> 56:22.930
Let me give you a sample.

56:23.702 --> 56:25.499
"I know that you're
the girl of my dreams.

56:25.603 --> 56:27.468
Hit me back. Let's hook up."

56:27.572 --> 56:28.937
He misspelled "girl".

56:29.040 --> 56:31.770
It just goes on and on.
It's like that or worse.

56:31.876 --> 56:35.710
Like every cheesy little perv-boy
on the Internet was her friend.

56:36.848 --> 56:42.218
She gets these messages from Peru
and Bangladesh and France.

56:42.320 --> 56:43.378
This girl never left Goshen.

56:48.426 --> 56:50.018
Slide over.

56:50.128 --> 56:51.356
It's dead in here.
I'll take a shift.

57:21.392 --> 57:24.327
Sarah, why are we doing this?

57:24.429 --> 57:25.919
She's my best friend.

57:26.030 --> 57:28.624
Yeah, I know. I know. I get that.

57:28.733 --> 57:30.724
But this...

57:30.835 --> 57:33.599
This is like above
and beyond best friends.

57:33.705 --> 57:37.402
I guess it's because
I know if I got into trouble

57:37.509 --> 57:40.842
I would always
have my mom and dad.

57:40.945 --> 57:41.877
And I think that most people

57:41.980 --> 57:44.949
have somebody who cares
about what happens to them.

57:45.049 --> 57:47.279
And the only person Jill has is me.

57:52.190 --> 57:54.351
I don't know what I'm doing.

57:55.627 --> 57:57.185
I have to open tomorrow.

57:57.295 --> 57:59.388
Yeah. I should lock up.

57:59.497 --> 58:00.964
Oh!

58:07.405 --> 58:11.034
Hey! What did you say
Jillian was calling this guy?

58:11.142 --> 58:12.234
A "Mr. X."

58:12.343 --> 58:13.674
You'd better check this out.

58:14.746 --> 58:15.735
Here. Look.

58:15.847 --> 58:17.542
Look at the name.
- Mr. eXperience?

58:17.649 --> 58:19.014
Mr. X! How did I miss that?

58:19.117 --> 58:20.175
He's still online.

58:39.003 --> 58:40.664
- Do you think this is our guy?
- I'm trying to find that out.

58:43.508 --> 58:46.375
Hey, he's logged off.

58:48.046 --> 58:51.743
What the hell does that mean?

59:06.431 --> 59:09.093
Jillian?

59:13.171 --> 59:15.139
Jillian?

59:42.267 --> 59:43.256
Jillian?

59:59.250 --> 01:00:02.014
<i>Sarah.</i>

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.054
<i>Up here.</i>

01:00:27.512 --> 01:00:28.410
Jillian?

01:00:47.131 --> 01:00:48.291
Patty?

01:00:58.543 --> 01:01:00.408
Oh!

01:01:01.446 --> 01:01:03.641
I know what you are, too.

01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:21.057
Now...

01:01:21.165 --> 01:01:23.497
...how long you say
your friend's been missing?

01:01:23.601 --> 01:01:28.436
- A couple of weeks.
- Couple of weeks?

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:34.607
My Janet was gone three years
before I realized.

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:39.641
Me and her old man,

01:01:39.751 --> 01:01:42.720
we didn't get on so well...
I'm sure you've heard the stories.

01:01:45.156 --> 01:01:48.353
Day doesn't go by
that I don't hate myself

01:01:48.459 --> 01:01:52.520
for leaving her
with that son-of-a-bitch.

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:54.029
Her "Daddy."

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.761
By the time I faced up to him,

01:01:57.869 --> 01:02:01.862
she was gone
and he didn't know where.

01:02:01.973 --> 01:02:04.134
Is that when you started
putting up flyers?

01:02:04.242 --> 01:02:07.075
Being a lowlife has its advantages.

01:02:07.245 --> 01:02:10.976
People underestimate you,
but I'm focused.

01:02:11.082 --> 01:02:17.214
I traveled, looked under a lot
of rocks, lived under a few, too.

01:02:20.892 --> 01:02:24.225
I've heard some stories.

01:02:24.328 --> 01:02:25.886
Like what?

01:02:25.997 --> 01:02:31.731
Children... disappearing.

01:02:31.836 --> 01:02:38.901
The kind of kids <i>nobody's</i> looking for.
The kind of kids <i>they</i> call "trash."

01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:44.277
"Runaway."
Like... Brenda Stills,

01:02:44.382 --> 01:02:46.179
Cindy Marker,

01:02:46.284 --> 01:02:47.581
Debbie Hope.

01:02:49.287 --> 01:02:51.346
Like your Jillian.

01:02:51.456 --> 01:02:54.357
Like my Janet.

01:02:58.529 --> 01:02:59.996
All lost.

01:03:01.365 --> 01:03:02.889
They're all lost.

01:03:08.039 --> 01:03:11.236
Sometimes when I...

01:03:11.342 --> 01:03:12.969
...feel her slipping away from me,

01:03:13.077 --> 01:03:17.207
I call her just to listen
to her voice on the message...

01:03:17.315 --> 01:03:21.684
...so I don't forget what she...

01:03:21.786 --> 01:03:24.983
...sound like.

01:03:28.726 --> 01:03:30.250
Where did you get that?

01:03:30.361 --> 01:03:32.761
- It's Jillian's!
- Jillian's?

01:03:35.466 --> 01:03:37.195
It's The Serpent himself!

01:03:37.301 --> 01:03:38.529
The serpent?

01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:43.206
- The devil.
- Patty, I don't know what that means.

01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:46.601
You can't see it in the flyers
because the copies are for crap,

01:03:46.711 --> 01:03:48.645
but on the original...

01:03:48.746 --> 01:03:50.839
...it's clear as day.

01:03:50.948 --> 01:03:53.382
Holy shit!

01:04:01.425 --> 01:04:03.791
Come on, Jasper. Pick up.
Come on.

01:04:07.765 --> 01:04:09.562
Come on, Jasper.

01:04:16.174 --> 01:04:16.640
Shit.

01:04:25.616 --> 01:04:28.642
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:04:28.753 --> 01:04:30.345
Jasper!

01:04:33.224 --> 01:04:34.589
Look.

01:04:37.161 --> 01:04:37.957
Fuck!

01:05:37.989 --> 01:05:39.684
He just went in back.

01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:43.351
Well, right on schedule.
Every day at 2:00 Billy hits the glue.

01:05:43.461 --> 01:05:45.929
Yeah, give him a couple of minutes.
You'll see.

01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:48.396
And you know this how?

01:05:48.499 --> 01:05:50.433
I collect model trains, all right?

01:05:50.534 --> 01:05:54.265
Have you ever tried to buy miniatures
from a stoner? It freaks them out.

01:05:54.372 --> 01:05:56.306
You sure it was Billy last night?

01:05:56.407 --> 01:05:59.103
The guy has tortured me
my entire life.

01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:02.145
I think I can recognize his voice.

01:06:02.246 --> 01:06:06.148
Okay. Let's get him.

01:06:36.914 --> 01:06:38.745
<i>Um...</i>

01:06:38.849 --> 01:06:41.340
<i>... hold on a second.</i>

01:06:46.524 --> 01:06:48.685
Agh!

01:06:48.793 --> 01:06:50.317
What the fuck?

01:06:50.428 --> 01:06:52.896
Ah! Oh!

01:06:52.997 --> 01:06:54.828
- Hey, Billy!
- Oh, man!

01:06:54.932 --> 01:06:56.524
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

01:06:56.634 --> 01:06:58.659
I'm on fucking duty any day...

01:07:01.572 --> 01:07:04.598
First question...
when you jumped Jasper last night,

01:07:04.709 --> 01:07:07.337
you said, "I know who you are, too."

01:07:07.511 --> 01:07:09.274
How did you know
we sent that message?

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.177
You tell me.
You're the honor student.

01:07:11.282 --> 01:07:12.840
Ugh!

01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:14.247
Ow!

01:07:14.352 --> 01:07:17.321
Well, I can guess the first part,
that you knew Jillian was Durtygrrl.

01:07:17.421 --> 01:07:19.651
It's the connection to Jasper
that I'm missing.

01:07:22.226 --> 01:07:23.523
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay.

01:07:23.627 --> 01:07:25.322
I knew...

01:07:25.429 --> 01:07:28.159
... how you think
you're such a genius, Ass-per.

01:07:28.466 --> 01:07:30.331
Nobody's heard from J in weeks.

01:07:31.135 --> 01:07:33.729
And all of a sudden
she's sending me messages

01:07:33.838 --> 01:07:36.102
with your ugly face
all over her profile.

01:07:36.207 --> 01:07:39.699
You'd never make Jay's Top 8.

01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:42.074
You'd never even
make her Top 800.

01:07:43.047 --> 01:07:45.880
I bet that really
pissed you off, right?

01:07:45.983 --> 01:07:48.315
That Jillian had a profile like that
to meet men.

01:07:48.419 --> 01:07:51.320
Yeah, and we all know you
do stupid things when you're angry.

01:07:51.422 --> 01:07:54.084
Yeah, it pissed me off.
That was the point, wasn't it?

01:07:54.191 --> 01:07:56.386
To piss me off.

01:07:56.494 --> 01:07:58.553
Jay was always doing stupid shit.

01:07:58.662 --> 01:08:00.926
She was always
playing games with me,

01:08:01.031 --> 01:08:03.192
telling me how many guys
wanted to fuck her.

01:08:04.635 --> 01:08:07.297
I never thought
she was serious, though.

01:08:10.408 --> 01:08:11.375
What do you know, Billy?

01:08:13.077 --> 01:08:14.601
Now you've got a choice.

01:08:14.712 --> 01:08:17.078
Face or nuts?
You can't cover them both.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:20.014
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay. Fuck you.

01:08:21.819 --> 01:08:23.979
Okay, I followed her...

01:08:24.087 --> 01:08:26.022
...okay, after the party.

01:08:27.758 --> 01:08:31.716
I thought it was part of the,

01:08:31.828 --> 01:08:33.591
part of the game.

01:08:33.697 --> 01:08:36.631
You know, she'd get me all mad,
and then I'd...

01:08:36.734 --> 01:08:38.827
...you know.

01:08:38.935 --> 01:08:40.698
I followed her downtown.

01:08:41.138 --> 01:08:43.162
And then I saw her get into a...

01:08:43.274 --> 01:08:44.639
...a car.

01:08:44.975 --> 01:08:47.535
She was laughing.

01:08:48.746 --> 01:08:50.008
Well, who was driving?

01:08:50.113 --> 01:08:52.412
I don't know.
I was too far away and couldn't see.

01:08:52.515 --> 01:08:53.743
What kind of car was it?

01:08:54.385 --> 01:08:57.046
I don't know!
It was a piece of shit!

01:08:57.154 --> 01:08:58.553
It looked like a rental!

01:08:58.656 --> 01:08:59.782
You want to know
who she was with?

01:08:59.890 --> 01:09:01.790
Ask your friend, the mole girl.

01:09:01.892 --> 01:09:02.984
No, no, no. I'm serious.

01:09:03.093 --> 01:09:05.720
I mean Darla. Darla. Ask Darla.

01:09:05.895 --> 01:09:07.090
She was there.

01:09:07.264 --> 01:09:08.287
Bullshit!

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:10.629
Why would Darla care
about what Jillian was doing?

01:09:10.734 --> 01:09:12.292
I don't freaking know!

01:09:15.206 --> 01:09:18.733
Come on. Let's go.

01:09:37.127 --> 01:09:39.357
- Do you believe him?
- I have to.

01:09:39.462 --> 01:09:41.863
Billy's too stupid to lie that well.

01:09:41.966 --> 01:09:43.763
Well, what do we do now?

01:09:43.868 --> 01:09:47.634
I'm going to wish Darla
a happy birthday.

01:10:28.879 --> 01:10:32.576
Oh, Sarah. Hello.

01:10:32.683 --> 01:10:35.777
Okay. Well, everybody's here.
Let's...

01:10:37.254 --> 01:10:39.119
...start the party.

01:10:39.223 --> 01:10:41.191
Dear Father, we thank You

01:10:41.292 --> 01:10:43.317
for us to be seated
at this table tonight

01:10:43.427 --> 01:10:46.191
eating this meal with good friends.

01:10:47.498 --> 01:10:51.298
Good friends
who are like family to us.

01:10:51.402 --> 01:10:53.870
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:10:53.971 --> 01:10:55.165
Amen.

01:11:04.515 --> 01:11:07.313
- Should I blow out the candles?
- Sure.

01:11:16.327 --> 01:11:17.453
<i>... when God created man and woman</i>

01:11:17.561 --> 01:11:23.329
<i>and God graced them in the garden</i>
<i>and things, things were good.</i>

01:11:23.434 --> 01:11:24.867
<i>But then ol' Lucifer comes along...</i>

01:11:24.969 --> 01:11:26.596
Darla.

01:11:26.704 --> 01:11:28.228
I need to ask you a question.

01:11:29.473 --> 01:11:32.374
- And I need you to tell me the truth.
- What is it?

01:11:32.476 --> 01:11:34.444
Darla?

01:11:34.545 --> 01:11:36.012
Darla, honey,

01:11:36.113 --> 01:11:37.205
could you feed the dogs?

01:11:37.314 --> 01:11:39.782
Their barking's driving me crazy.
I'll take over for you. Go on.

01:11:39.883 --> 01:11:41.043
<i>... guard themselves</i>

01:11:41.151 --> 01:11:44.143
<i>if they're taking of the fruit</i>
<i>from the Tree of Knowledge.</i>

01:11:44.254 --> 01:11:47.553
<i>Now, we all know Lucifer,</i>

01:11:47.658 --> 01:11:51.059
<i>just as in the nature of birds</i>
<i>to sing and the bees to make honey,</i>

01:11:51.161 --> 01:11:54.858
<i>so it is the nature</i>
<i>of the Devil to tempt...</i>

01:11:54.965 --> 01:11:58.264
Glad you were able to come tonight.

01:11:58.369 --> 01:12:03.170
She, uh, ahem,
doesn't have a lot of friends.

01:12:03.273 --> 01:12:05.173
<i>... for God cannot be tempted,</i>

01:12:05.342 --> 01:12:07.071
<i>nor does He kid anyone.</i>

01:12:08.712 --> 01:12:09.804
Oh! Sorry.

01:12:09.913 --> 01:12:13.474
- I think my necklace is caught.
- You need some help with it?

01:12:13.584 --> 01:12:17.076
Uh, sure.

01:12:17.187 --> 01:12:19.417
<i>... once desire has taken root...</i>

01:12:19.523 --> 01:12:22.356
Just a second.

01:12:22.459 --> 01:12:24.689
I used to be pretty good at this.

01:12:24.795 --> 01:12:25.784
Let me just...

01:12:25.896 --> 01:12:27.386
<i>... I want to read for you</i>
<i>from the Book of...</i>

01:12:28.298 --> 01:12:29.663
Oh!

01:12:29.767 --> 01:12:31.234
<i>... at the window of my house,</i>

01:12:31.335 --> 01:12:34.896
<i>I witnessed among him</i>
<i>a youth who lacked judgment...</i>

01:12:35.005 --> 01:12:35.994
What is this?

01:12:36.106 --> 01:12:37.334
An unusual piece.
Where did you get that?

01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:41.400
- It's a friend's.
- Oh.

01:12:41.512 --> 01:12:43.309
Ow!
Damn it!

01:12:44.581 --> 01:12:45.980
Ow!

01:12:48.252 --> 01:12:49.651
Tie this!

01:12:49.753 --> 01:12:51.846
Come here, would you, and tie this!

01:12:51.955 --> 01:12:53.547
Tie it off!

01:12:53.657 --> 01:12:55.522
Come on!

01:12:55.926 --> 01:12:57.154
Give me it!

01:13:11.308 --> 01:13:14.209
Um, I actually need to go.

01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:28.753
Come on.

01:13:33.964 --> 01:13:36.956
- Is something wrong with your car?
- Yeah, um...

01:13:37.067 --> 01:13:38.500
No. It's, uh...

01:13:38.602 --> 01:13:41.196
- I can just call my friend.
- Daddy?

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:59.648
You won't tell, will you?

01:14:01.859 --> 01:14:03.224
I thought you were allergic.

01:14:03.894 --> 01:14:06.829
Well...

01:14:06.997 --> 01:14:11.798
...we don't always
love what's good for us.

01:14:11.902 --> 01:14:15.998
Poe called it
"the imp of the perverse."

01:14:17.441 --> 01:14:22.174
Take your friend, uh, Jillian.

01:14:22.279 --> 01:14:26.113
I bet she's the type of girl runnin'
around with all the wrong boys.

01:14:26.216 --> 01:14:29.913
The kind of boys that will
get her into trouble, you know,

01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:36.323
give her a reputation.

01:14:36.426 --> 01:14:38.986
You still searching for her?

01:14:43.033 --> 01:14:44.967
No. I kind of gave that up.

01:14:45.736 --> 01:14:49.069
She doesn't strike me as the type of
person to stay in one place too long.

01:14:58.282 --> 01:15:00.182
You're different.

01:15:00.284 --> 01:15:04.118
You have a better sense
of self-preservation.

01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:08.981
Kids around here
just don't have that.

01:15:09.092 --> 01:15:14.291
They're just brought up
too comfortable,

01:15:14.398 --> 01:15:15.831
just too safe.

01:15:23.207 --> 01:15:26.335
You still, uh, jog on the River Run?

01:15:29.279 --> 01:15:31.247
No. Not so much.

01:15:31.348 --> 01:15:35.045
That's a beautiful trail,
the River Run.

01:15:37.688 --> 01:15:39.952
You feel like you're
the only person left in the world

01:15:40.057 --> 01:15:42.958
when you're out there.

01:15:59.343 --> 01:16:00.833
Do you want me
to walk you to the door?

01:16:00.944 --> 01:16:03.970
No, thanks.

01:16:04.081 --> 01:16:05.708
All right, then.

01:16:05.883 --> 01:16:12.186
I'll just wait here
till you get in all right.

01:16:12.623 --> 01:16:17.322
# <i>For you're bound to die</i> #

01:16:17.427 --> 01:16:23.525
# <i>For you're bound to die</i> #

01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:01.516
Jillian?

01:19:01.625 --> 01:19:04.219
<i>She doesn't want you looking for her!</i>

01:19:04.327 --> 01:19:05.259
Who is this?

01:19:05.362 --> 01:19:06.727
<i>She's moved on.</i>

01:19:06.897 --> 01:19:08.364
<i>She has a new life.</i>

01:19:08.465 --> 01:19:09.796
<i>She doesn't need you.</i>

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:11.026
Why can't she tell me that?

01:19:11.134 --> 01:19:13.068
<i>She has!</i>

01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:15.536
<i>She's happy with her new life.</i>

01:19:15.639 --> 01:19:18.107
<i>She wants to be left alone.</i>

01:19:18.208 --> 01:19:20.574
Are the others happy, too?

01:19:20.677 --> 01:19:23.271
Is Janet Melville happy?

01:19:26.716 --> 01:19:27.307
Hello?

01:19:27.417 --> 01:19:29.977
<i>Don't tempt me.</i>

01:19:30.087 --> 01:19:35.320
<i>I'm not the one who should be afraid.</i>

01:20:22.772 --> 01:20:25.536
Nobody here.

01:20:26.443 --> 01:20:29.935
Now, what did he want?

01:20:33.183 --> 01:20:34.548
Holy shit!

01:20:34.651 --> 01:20:36.585
I think he wants us to stop.

01:20:36.686 --> 01:20:38.153
He makes a good point!

01:20:38.255 --> 01:20:40.314
We can't quit. Not now.

01:20:40.423 --> 01:20:42.152
We can't? Watch this.

01:20:42.259 --> 01:20:46.161
Hey, look, a tall, fucking psycho just
staked a snake to your basement door!

01:20:46.263 --> 01:20:47.457
I quit!

01:20:47.564 --> 01:20:49.259
- See? It's easy!
- You don't think I'm scared, too?

01:20:52.068 --> 01:20:55.868
I am so fucking scared.

01:20:55.972 --> 01:21:00.636
But somebody did this because they're
hiding something really horrible.

01:21:00.744 --> 01:21:02.974
And my best friend is a part of it.

01:21:06.449 --> 01:21:08.576
So that's why I can't quit, you know.

01:21:08.685 --> 01:21:10.710
And that's why you can't quit.

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.685
She wasn't my friend.

01:21:12.789 --> 01:21:15.519
Yeah, but you're mine.

01:21:19.196 --> 01:21:21.289
And I can't do this without you.

01:21:31.474 --> 01:21:32.304
All right.

01:21:35.845 --> 01:21:38.541
All right.

01:21:39.149 --> 01:21:41.845
But if I get killed
and lose my scholarship,

01:21:41.952 --> 01:21:43.715
<i>you</i> have to explain to my mom.

01:21:45.722 --> 01:21:47.212
Deal.

01:21:50.927 --> 01:21:53.919
And one other thing...

01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:55.657
Can you spend the night tonight?

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.759
Well, I don't know.

01:22:24.861 --> 01:22:27.523
He wouldn't be the first guy
to swear after hurting himself.

01:22:27.631 --> 01:22:30.691
Well, yeah, but it isn't what he said.
It's how he said it, you know?

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:31.767
If you ask me,

01:22:31.868 --> 01:22:35.429
living way out here
would make anyone strange.

01:22:55.025 --> 01:22:57.585
All right. Give it a try.

01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:00.928
Nice!

01:23:01.031 --> 01:23:02.396
What did you do?

01:23:06.336 --> 01:23:08.634
Nothing.

01:25:38.121 --> 01:25:39.053
You scared me.

01:25:39.155 --> 01:25:40.452
What are you doing here?

01:25:40.557 --> 01:25:41.615
Where's Jillian, Darla?

01:25:42.859 --> 01:25:46.056
- What?
- Where's Jillian?

01:25:48.031 --> 01:25:49.965
- I don't know.
- Stop lying to me.

01:25:50.066 --> 01:25:52.330
Darla, you have her clothes.
You've been dressing up like her.

01:25:52.435 --> 01:25:53.595
Where is she?

01:25:53.703 --> 01:25:55.694
I found her clothes
in her locker at work.

01:25:55.805 --> 01:25:57.534
What about this?

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:00.074
I <i>know</i> she didn't leave this behind.

01:26:00.176 --> 01:26:01.837
Darla, please.

01:26:01.945 --> 01:26:04.345
Where did you get this?

01:26:04.447 --> 01:26:07.848
You left it for me to find.
You wanted me to have it. Why?

01:26:08.017 --> 01:26:10.485
If you don't tell me
and something bad happens to her,

01:26:10.587 --> 01:26:12.145
it's gonna be your fault.

01:26:12.255 --> 01:26:15.554
It was supposed to be
a family vacation!

01:26:22.799 --> 01:26:25.324
Have you ever had a secret...

01:26:25.435 --> 01:26:28.734
...that you couldn't
live with keeping?

01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:32.331
And you think about it so much,
you begin to think

01:26:32.442 --> 01:26:37.402
that people can tell your secret
just by looking at you?

01:26:37.514 --> 01:26:40.574
And you begin hoping that it's true,

01:26:40.683 --> 01:26:43.743
that maybe someone
<i>will</i> tell your secret for you

01:26:43.853 --> 01:26:45.480
and you don't have to?

01:26:45.588 --> 01:26:47.021
Darla, I need more than that.

01:26:47.123 --> 01:26:51.719
It was supposed to be
a family vacation.

01:26:53.596 --> 01:26:57.123
But at the last minute,
he had to leave.

01:26:57.233 --> 01:27:00.202
Something came up.

01:27:00.303 --> 01:27:04.603
I don't know why it made me so mad.
It's the same thing every year.

01:27:04.707 --> 01:27:08.643
But this time,
I took my cousin's car back into town,

01:27:08.811 --> 01:27:11.302
and I saw him with her.

01:27:14.317 --> 01:27:17.252
She was laughing at him.

01:27:17.353 --> 01:27:19.116
Darla, did you get this necklace
from your dad?

01:27:20.557 --> 01:27:21.489
Darla?

01:27:22.859 --> 01:27:25.453
Is someone here with you?

01:27:25.562 --> 01:27:26.961
I thought I heard someone talking.

01:27:27.063 --> 01:27:29.896
I... I was speaking to myself.

01:27:29.999 --> 01:27:32.627
Honey, what's wrong?

01:27:32.735 --> 01:27:36.398
There were some things
said at church today.

01:27:36.506 --> 01:27:41.205
Sometimes that stuff
can get so depressing.

01:27:42.378 --> 01:27:45.245
Come here.

01:27:45.348 --> 01:27:50.149
Sometimes those stories are meant
to teach us what's right and wrong,

01:27:50.253 --> 01:27:53.051
and they're not always easy to hear.

01:27:53.623 --> 01:27:56.524
I know, Daddy.

01:27:59.829 --> 01:28:02.730
I'm glad you take them to heart.

01:28:07.770 --> 01:28:09.704
Smile.

01:28:12.642 --> 01:28:15.133
All right?

01:28:22.085 --> 01:28:24.485
Are you sure there's not something
you want to tell me?

01:28:24.587 --> 01:28:26.555
No.

01:28:30.526 --> 01:28:32.790
Okay.

01:28:47.644 --> 01:28:50.613
Darla, please.

01:28:50.713 --> 01:28:52.237
The necklace.

01:28:52.348 --> 01:28:56.876
Where did you get this necklace?

01:28:59.422 --> 01:29:03.290
I found it...

01:29:03.393 --> 01:29:05.054
...in the bus.

01:29:06.095 --> 01:29:11.328
He keeps things there.

01:30:14.664 --> 01:30:17.224
Whoa!

01:30:42.658 --> 01:30:44.023
Shit.

01:30:44.627 --> 01:30:45.685
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

01:31:16.492 --> 01:31:18.460
That's it.

01:31:18.561 --> 01:31:22.053
We're not going in there, are we?

01:31:22.165 --> 01:31:25.566
I am.

01:31:25.668 --> 01:31:29.399
You keep an eye on the house.

01:32:39.475 --> 01:32:40.464
<i>Gannon...</i>

01:32:40.576 --> 01:32:42.203
<i>... Girlscout.</i>

01:33:19.548 --> 01:33:21.277
<i>Janet?</i>

01:33:21.384 --> 01:33:23.409
<i>Janet, baby, is that you?</i>

01:33:23.519 --> 01:33:24.417
Patty?

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.181
<i>Who the hell is this?</i>

01:33:26.289 --> 01:33:27.847
It's Sarah.

01:33:27.957 --> 01:33:30.255
<i>Sarah, what are you doing</i>
<i>with my baby's phone?</i>

01:33:30.359 --> 01:33:32.384
Patty... Patty, listen to me.

01:33:32.495 --> 01:33:33.928
You have to call the police,
and you have to tell them

01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:35.622
to come to the Tod house right now.

01:33:35.731 --> 01:33:38.894
<i>Why the hell would I do that?</i>

01:33:39.001 --> 01:33:41.970
Because I found your daughter
and the other missing girls.

01:34:10.566 --> 01:34:11.726
<i>What?</i>
- You need to see this.

01:34:13.302 --> 01:34:14.860
Please tell me
you didn't find anything...

01:34:26.248 --> 01:34:27.647
Yeah. I think we're good.

01:34:31.821 --> 01:34:34.051
Shit! Not good!
No, we are definitely not good!

01:34:36.258 --> 01:34:37.555
Fuck!

01:36:56.565 --> 01:36:58.590
Sarah?

01:36:58.701 --> 01:37:01.636
- What are you doing here?
- What did you do with her?

01:37:03.072 --> 01:37:05.734
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

01:37:05.841 --> 01:37:08.571
I have to think about Darla.

01:37:08.744 --> 01:37:09.733
She's all I got.

01:37:09.845 --> 01:37:11.312
What about the families
that you destroyed?

01:37:11.413 --> 01:37:13.176
Do you think about them?

01:37:13.282 --> 01:37:14.579
Now, let's be reasonable.

01:37:14.683 --> 01:37:17.447
You can tell Patty Melville
to be reasonable!

01:37:17.553 --> 01:37:18.952
And while you're at it,
you can tell the police,

01:37:19.054 --> 01:37:20.453
because they're
gonna be here any second!

01:37:20.556 --> 01:37:22.114
No, no, that's not gonna happen.

01:37:23.192 --> 01:37:27.288
You can't comprehend
the sacrifices I've made!

01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:29.964
They were tempting me!

01:37:30.065 --> 01:37:31.692
They were trying
to get me to do things,

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.234
disgusting things!

01:37:34.336 --> 01:37:35.894
They were trying to hurt my family.

01:37:36.005 --> 01:37:38.371
The only thing
destroying your family is you!

01:37:38.474 --> 01:37:39.964
Oh!

01:37:43.579 --> 01:37:44.341
You!

01:39:37.359 --> 01:39:38.621
Oh! Shit!

01:39:38.727 --> 01:39:40.524
I thought...

01:39:45.434 --> 01:39:46.833
Even though I walk through the valley

01:39:46.935 --> 01:39:50.632
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil for thou art...

01:39:50.739 --> 01:39:52.263
What is he doing?

01:39:54.209 --> 01:39:55.836
He's praying.

01:39:55.944 --> 01:39:58.412
Sarah?

01:39:59.515 --> 01:40:01.176
Don't you fucking move!

01:40:01.283 --> 01:40:06.243
The Lord knows my heart,
and <i>He</i> will judge me.

01:40:07.022 --> 01:40:09.149
Like hell!

01:40:09.792 --> 01:40:12.886
You'll never find the bodies.

01:40:12.995 --> 01:40:14.963
You'll never know.

01:40:15.064 --> 01:40:16.759
Daddy?

01:40:18.534 --> 01:40:20.126
Daddy?

01:40:24.973 --> 01:40:27.373
Come here.

01:40:27.476 --> 01:40:28.773
Come down here.

01:40:29.712 --> 01:40:31.270
What do you want?

01:40:33.749 --> 01:40:36.912
I want to tell you...

01:40:37.019 --> 01:40:38.111
...everything.

01:40:40.756 --> 01:40:41.745
Sarah...

01:40:55.304 --> 01:40:57.101
Closer.

01:40:57.806 --> 01:41:00.536
Closer.

01:41:23.999 --> 01:41:28.368
The last thing she said
was your name.

01:41:32.875 --> 01:41:36.333
Now do it.

01:41:36.445 --> 01:41:39.903
Do it for me like I did it...

01:41:40.015 --> 01:41:41.004
...for your friend.

01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:48.246
Just...

01:41:48.357 --> 01:41:50.757
...stop my breath.

01:41:55.063 --> 01:41:57.429
Sarah.

01:42:03.639 --> 01:42:04.970
No.

01:42:11.246 --> 01:42:13.976
No, Sarah.

01:42:14.082 --> 01:42:15.242
What about Darla?

01:42:17.386 --> 01:42:19.217
She's so innocent.

01:42:21.557 --> 01:42:23.787
None of us are innocent.

01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:30.123
Daddy!

01:42:35.137 --> 01:42:36.900
Daddy!

01:44:50.811 --> 01:44:51.811
