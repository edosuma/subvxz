WEBVTT

00:08.592 --> 00:11.083
She wants you downstairs with the egg.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.922
-Yeah?
-Now.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.550
Tara?

00:15.933 --> 00:17.423
Tara?

00:17.601 --> 00:19.432
What are you doing?

00:20.103 --> 00:21.684
He's coming.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.937
This means he's coming.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.272
Tara! Tara, what--?

00:29.446 --> 00:32.028
Lafayette, sweetie?

00:32.199 --> 00:35.441
I'm your friend. I know you're in there.
You don't want to do this.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.985
Prepare her for Bromios.
Prepare her for Den tr1' tes.

00:38.163 --> 00:41.246
Prepare her for Eleutherios. Prepare--

00:41.416 --> 00:42.792
Take off your clothes.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.541
What?

00:44.711 --> 00:46.167
Listen to what you're saying.

00:46.338 --> 00:51.128
I have a thousand-year-old vampire blood
in me. Now, take off your fucking Clothes!

00:51.301 --> 00:53.212
--Dentr1'tes. Prepare her for Eleutherios.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.628
Prepare her for En orch es.
Prepare her for Bromios.

00:55.806 --> 00:59.139
Prepare her for Den tr1' tes.
Prepare her for Eleutherios.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.483
Now put this on.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.484
Prepare her for Bromios.
Prepare her for Den tr1' tes.

01:14.658 --> 01:18.150
Prepare her for Eleutherios. Prepare her
for En orch es. Prepare her for--

01:19.496 --> 01:23.455
Get down here. We're waiting for you.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.746
Here she is, just like you wanted.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.338
Just in time.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.470
What the hell are you doing in
my grandmother's wedding dress?

01:38.640 --> 01:40.596
Welcome, Sookie.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.019
You're gonna be my maid of honor.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.520
-Eggs, let me go.
-Don't fight it.

03:18.699 --> 03:19.734
Just let it take you.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.694
I've spent enough time being taken.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.450
Shush, you haven't been taken.
Just borrowed.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.737
To go along with old,
new and blue over here.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.576
Which one am I?

03:28.750 --> 03:30.365
You have no right
to wear that dress.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.626
I should have asked,
but I couldn't find you.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.287
-You'll never use it anyway.
-Oh, go to hell.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.751
Please don't be so negative.

03:37.926 --> 03:38.961
It is my day.

03:39.136 --> 03:42.503
And you're in my house.
And those are my friends.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.888
Plus Jane Bodehouse.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.391
I've always liked you, Sookie.
You give me extra pickles.

03:50.147 --> 03:54.060
I don't know how you did
what you've done to them...

03:54.234 --> 03:57.647
...but I will not let this happen.

03:58.572 --> 04:03.532
Girls, would you mind going
and helping with refreshments.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.535
I need to have a moment
with my maid of honor.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.071
Come on, Lafayette.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.240
Oh, and bring some vines.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.455
You too, Eggs.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.006
She's not going anywhere.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.679
I'm all yours. Give it your best.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.258
My best what?

04:29.436 --> 04:30.801
The electricity.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.935
-Do it again.
-I can't.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.688
It's never happened before.
I don't know what it was.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.350
I've never felt anything like it.
Like nature herself...

04:38.528 --> 04:40.610
...was shooting out from your fingertips.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.131
That's hitting me.
You're not committing to this at all.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.587
I do not have electrical powers.

05:03.762 --> 05:04.968
lam a human being.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.378
You keep saying that.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.218
But if you were human...

05:15.899 --> 05:18.561
...I would have taken you over by now.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.396
Come on.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.027
It'll be our little secret.

05:23.198 --> 05:24.404
What are you?

05:24.574 --> 05:26.565
I'm a waitress.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.654
What the fuck are you?

05:48.014 --> 05:49.550
Mama, no!

05:51.101 --> 05:54.764
What good's it do you to keep your mother
locked up in her own house?

05:54.938 --> 05:58.101
-Norman Bates.
-l'm gonna take everything you've said...

05:58.275 --> 06:00.766
...for the last two days
about me, about Daddy...

06:00.944 --> 06:03.902
...l'm gonna lock it up in a little box,
and forget it happened.

06:05.073 --> 06:09.533
This is bigger than
your petty little feelings.

06:09.703 --> 06:13.821
A god is coming into our midst.

06:13.999 --> 06:18.459
Does any part of your puny brain
understand what that means?

06:21.339 --> 06:22.954
We're staying home.

06:27.804 --> 06:28.964
Think back.

06:29.139 --> 06:32.131
Wasn't there ever a time
you felt someone...

06:32.309 --> 06:34.391
...or something watching over you?

06:34.978 --> 06:37.720
Yes. God.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.475
Well, you can call it that.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.936
But it's not the same one
the blind billions worship.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.615
And in your heart of hearts, you know it.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.452
Fine. Then what am I?

06:54.623 --> 06:56.830
You're definitely beyond human.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.240
| live off human energy.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.204
And yours I can't channel.

07:00.378 --> 07:04.337
That's very rare, though surprisingly
not unique in this town.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.631
Sam.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.716
You're marrying Sam?

07:12.682 --> 07:14.968
Please.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.974
My husband is a god.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.306
Sam is....

07:20.315 --> 07:22.180
He's just the ideal wedding gift.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.361
Oh, it's been such a long wait.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.145
I'm sorry. I'm getting a little overexcited.

07:28.323 --> 07:29.358
l'll smear everything.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.784
How do you know he's coming tonight?

07:33.036 --> 07:35.322
Oh, no time has ever been more perfect.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.034
I know my special sacrifice is on his way.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.540
He's done nothing to you.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.797
He is the vessel.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.705
He appeared to me naked...

07:46.883 --> 07:51.343
...a virgin, drawn to the very statue
that represents the birth of my god.

07:51.805 --> 07:55.969
Should have sacrificed him then and there,
but I foolishly let him go.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.134
By sacrifice, does that involve
cutting out his heart?

08:00.146 --> 08:01.807
It's the food of the gods.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.810
My husband will love it.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.811
It's the very thing that gives him life.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.105
You'll never get Sam.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.408
He can escape you.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.908
That is why you are here.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.865
It's fate.

08:18.581 --> 08:22.244
Just as Sam Merlotte is the one
who will bring forth my husband...

08:22.419 --> 08:26.037
...you, my dear, are the one
who will bring forth Sam Merlotte.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.006
The moment he learns where you are...

08:30.176 --> 08:32.963
...he'll come running like a dog.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.924
Maybe even as a dog.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.557
There.

08:45.900 --> 08:49.438
Isn't that beautiful?

09:03.293 --> 09:05.079
How long does this game go on for?

09:05.253 --> 09:06.709
We play to 5 million.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.462
-She's way ahead.
-lt's pure luck.

09:09.924 --> 09:13.132
Yahtzee is the most egalitarian
game in the world.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.464
You could be my social, physical...

09:15.638 --> 09:19.130
...or intellectual inferior,
but your chances are equal to mine.

09:19.309 --> 09:22.767
The perfect antidote for this world,
where things such as superiority...

09:22.937 --> 09:25.223
...and inferiority do matter.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.978
Speaking of which,
I heard about your maker.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.141
That blows.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.649
Thank you.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.155
-Your Majesty is very kind--
-Yahtzee!

09:36.326 --> 09:37.987
-That's six in a row.
-It is magic.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.322
I do not cheat.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.362
What would be the point?

09:42.665 --> 09:44.405
I'm sorry. You were saying?

09:45.001 --> 09:47.037
l was saying thank you.
Your Majesty's kind--

09:47.212 --> 09:49.168
Oh, yes. Now I remember.

09:49.339 --> 09:52.081
Did you know that there's
a maenad in Renard Parish?

09:52.258 --> 09:54.294
Yes, that is the reason
I came to see you.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.425
I wouldn't get involved if I were you.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.712
Stick to what you're good at.

09:58.890 --> 10:01.757
I gave William Compton a few
bits of hand-me-down folklore...

10:01.935 --> 10:06.099
...we've accumulated over the centuries,
but who knows if it's gospel or gorilla shit?

10:07.857 --> 10:10.940
You know, I think he's
monogamous with his human.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.859
He is in love with her, yes.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.440
He is?

10:16.783 --> 10:20.696
Well, of course he would be with her.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.030
You probably are too.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.364
I do not love humans.

10:26.543 --> 10:30.035
She's not entirely human.
Have you tasted her?

10:31.548 --> 10:33.960
-Sadly, no.
-Don't. Ever.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.341
One vampire falling in love
is bad enough.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.878
Yes. Bill Compton certainly
has a knack for finding trouble.

10:43.518 --> 10:46.635
...l'm having you sell vampire blood?

10:47.397 --> 10:49.558
The guards hear everything.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.108
Your Majesty, I'm sorry.

10:51.276 --> 10:54.643
-There's no way he could--
-That is really bad.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.320
He does not know
that you are supplying it.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.075
He'd better not.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.036
I'm holding you responsible.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.499
There they are.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.887
Aren't yours lovely.

11:21.764 --> 11:25.757
You may be the strongest,
oldest vampire in my queendom...

11:26.144 --> 11:30.308
...but if I wanted, I could own
your fangs as earrings.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.857
Understand?

11:32.025 --> 11:34.732
I will take care of Bill Compton.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.606
Personally.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.613
Your turn to make Yahtzee.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.474
You suck at this.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.480
You sure you wanna go in
with no backup?

12:14.651 --> 12:16.312
You're my backup.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.976
Now, this is Special Ops.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.110
We're surgical. One shot.

12:20.281 --> 12:23.023
Say hello to my little friend.

12:23.701 --> 12:26.408
Hasta la vista, baby.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.956
I love the smell of nail polish
in the morning.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.926
Holy shit.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.509
That's Stackhouse property.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.675
They got no right to do that.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.011
You just gonna run in there?

12:53.189 --> 12:55.475
We're way outnumbered.

12:56.693 --> 13:00.106
Not with Kid Glock on my side.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.861
And yours.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.944
I never killed nobody before.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.238
You see that house?

13:12.875 --> 13:16.208
It's been in my family for 150 years.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.040
What kind of man would stand by...

13:18.214 --> 13:21.206
...while his grandmother's house
gets tore to the ground?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.875
It's not my grandmother's house.

13:24.053 --> 13:27.216
But it's in the town
you swore to protect.

13:28.349 --> 13:32.137
It's times like these when this
town needs a good man, Andy.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.475
And that man is us.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.184
Let's hit it.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.570
Detective Bellefleur. Frisk me.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.905
Hey, get off.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.695
Come here.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.914
-Jason!
-Andy!

13:55.084 --> 13:57.871
-No one sees the bride before the wedding.
-The what?

13:58.046 --> 14:00.708
-Step away from the house.
-Jason!

14:00.882 --> 14:02.497
-Andy!
-Don't fight it.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.757
-Don't fight it.
-Andy!

14:05.303 --> 14:08.090
-Andy, where are you?
-Right here.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.179
Hi.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.591
He's coming!

14:15.855 --> 14:17.766
Fuck,yeah!

14:27.241 --> 14:30.108
Lisa was so worried about her mom
she was afraid to go to bed.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.619
If you'd let me glamour them,
they would have been asleep in seconds.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.114
You've heard there is
a maenad in our midst.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.699
Yeah, I'm familiar.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.868
Are you aware she's here
because of you?

14:40.838 --> 14:42.123
Something like that.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.539
I need you...

14:44.717 --> 14:46.753
...and Sookie needs you...

14:46.928 --> 14:48.293
...to make this right.

14:48.471 --> 14:52.931
If I thought it was as easy as giving myself
up to Maryann, I'd have done that by now.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.179
And what's to say
she's gonna stop with me?

14:56.354 --> 14:59.391
Killers don't just suddenly quit killing.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.306
You ought to know that.

15:01.484 --> 15:05.193
And standing by idly
is not an option either.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.154
You must come with me.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.656
No, I'm not sure I wanna be doing that.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.823
I'm not sure I'm giving you a choice.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.159
Okay, what is with the egg?

15:22.338 --> 15:23.578
Did you lay it?

15:23.756 --> 15:27.089
No, silly, it's an ostrich egg.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.500
It represents fertility.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.339
Anoint it with his blood.

15:31.514 --> 15:35.427
You're the maid of honor.
You have to lick the egg.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.183
Just lick it, already.

15:45.570 --> 15:49.358
Oh, yeah. Only through the blood
will he come.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.956
Shit. Oh, Shit. Oh, shit.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.378
Ma'am...

16:06.549 --> 16:08.710
...your vessel has arrived.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.714
Oh, Jason, no.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.881
Sookie, you look...

16:16.350 --> 16:17.886
...beautiful.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.187
Girls, the time has come.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.393
You too.

16:27.028 --> 16:30.486
I will not be part of anything so evil.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.032
You. You're the brother?

16:35.203 --> 16:36.818
Maybe I could kill you.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.532
Make sure she behaves.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.917
Here we go.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.751
-You're gonna break my arm!
-Don't make me, because I'll do it.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.457
Maenad!

17:27.129 --> 17:28.790
Bill! What the hell are you doing?

17:29.298 --> 17:30.629
l have your sacrifice.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.791
Oh, my sweet vessel.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.709
I offer him in exchange for Sookie.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.970
-No! She'll kill him!
-She's not gonna stop with me.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.218
Take her to the dead man.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.054
She's served her purpose.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.970
Bill, you can't let her kill Sam!

17:45.147 --> 17:46.648
Sorry. This is the only way.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.306
Get your fucking hands off me!

17:48.484 --> 17:49.815
Sam, no!

17:50.152 --> 17:51.483
Let go of me!

17:51.654 --> 17:53.485
Get her out of here.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.271
I won't have her watch me die.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.821
I will always be grateful to you.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.452
This isn't for you.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.664
Gentlemen, he's yours.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.336
Hi, Sam.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.791
Get the hell off me.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.256
This is what your vampire source
told you to do? To give up Sam?

18:18.431 --> 18:20.592
Sookie, you have to trust me.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.092
Let us call forth our God.

18:30.568 --> 18:31.683
God with horns!

18:33.112 --> 18:34.773
Worship him, bitches!

18:37.700 --> 18:40.112
Now the sacrificial egg.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.651
He's coming! He's coming!

18:41.829 --> 18:44.536
He's coming! He's coming! He's coming!

18:47.335 --> 18:48.996
Hail Dionysus.

18:49.337 --> 18:50.952
Hail Dionysus.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.041
-Bacchus.
-Bacchus.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.206
-Bromios.
-Bromios.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.875
-Eleutherios.
-Eleutherios.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.340
-Dendrites.
-Dendrites.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.551
All these names of yours,
our bull-horned god.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.342
Upon this occasion of our marriage...

19:07.063 --> 19:10.055
...our offering symbolizes
the rebirth of our god.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.685
When he was a child...

19:12.860 --> 19:15.727
...the jealous Titans
ripped him to shreds...

19:15.905 --> 19:18.191
...eating all but his heart.

19:18.824 --> 19:22.066
And this last piece
was saved by his sister...

19:22.244 --> 19:24.075
...Pallas Athena...

19:24.830 --> 19:28.322
...who placed it into the womb
of his mother so that he could be reborn.

19:33.214 --> 19:36.456
Oh, great mother,
soon you shall have the heart...

19:36.634 --> 19:39.250
...that will make your egg grow fertile...

19:39.428 --> 19:42.420
...and your son, our bull-horned god...

19:42.598 --> 19:45.761
...will come and stand in your place.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.689
No! Stop!

19:54.985 --> 19:56.486
No!

19:58.364 --> 19:59.399
Sam!

20:06.038 --> 20:08.199
Oh, at last.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.745
At long, long last.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.453
He is yours, my lord.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.255
-Stop! No!
-You're lucky, Sam.

20:22.430 --> 20:25.297
It's everyone's wish to have
their life mean something.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.307
So few ever get to realize it.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.217
-Come on, do it already.
-Do it.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.386
Sacrifice him!

20:32.565 --> 20:35.056
Sam, use your gift.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.475
Sookie, use yours.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.524
Thank you.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.910
Sam!

20:53.294 --> 20:54.750
Sam.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.335
Bring me the blood.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.026
Oh, yes.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.855
He is the vessel.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.271
My lord, this is the vessel
who shall unite us.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.950
Sookie.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.326
Sookie.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.237
Sam.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.450
Sam.

21:35.169 --> 21:36.454
I'm sorry.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.211
I'm so, so sorry.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.463
Destroy it.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.543
A1] of it.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.551
The egg! You killed our sacred egg!

21:53.729 --> 21:56.186
It's not sacred. None of it's sacred.

21:56.357 --> 21:57.972
It's evil.

22:09.912 --> 22:14.246
How dare you spoil my offering!

22:16.085 --> 22:19.202
Lord Dionysus, forgive me.

22:24.635 --> 22:27.092
Allow me to sacrifice...

22:27.263 --> 22:29.424
...all of them for you.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.599
Stop it!

22:39.733 --> 22:40.893
You're hurting them!

22:43.320 --> 22:45.606
You brought this upon everyone.

23:04.842 --> 23:05.877
Help!

23:30.284 --> 23:31.820
My lord.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.446
My husband.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.448
Oh, you've come.

23:39.627 --> 23:40.992
I am here, my love.

23:54.475 --> 23:57.182
We're together at last.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.472
Come to me.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.652
My God. I am the one to be sacrificed.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.371
Oh, I am the vessel.

24:19.541 --> 24:20.621
Yes.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.499
I'm happy to die.

24:27.424 --> 24:28.630
I'm yours.

24:41.230 --> 24:43.346
Was there no god?

25:07.506 --> 25:08.621
Sam!

25:08.799 --> 25:10.539
He killed you.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.253
No.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.759
Almost.

25:23.397 --> 25:26.389
ls--? Is she gone?

25:26.567 --> 25:28.853
-I think so.
-ls Sam all right?

25:29.028 --> 25:31.610
He had to drink more of me
than I expected.

25:31.780 --> 25:32.860
He's okay.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.739
I promised Sam that I would heal him.

25:38.454 --> 25:41.537
We knew no other way
of destroying her.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.909
I understand.

25:44.334 --> 25:46.711
I'm sorry if I worried you.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.791
I so badly wished that
you could hear my thoughts.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.377
Sam, you were willing to die for us.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.339
Bill kind of promised
he wouldn't let that happen.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.890
But if things didn't work out, I guess. l....

25:59.058 --> 26:00.889
l was ready.

26:05.856 --> 26:07.562
Holy fuck.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.487
We got her?

26:20.871 --> 26:22.987
-You remember anything?
-No.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.451
It was bad, wasn't it?

26:25.626 --> 26:26.911
Bill, get rid of the body.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.667
Bury it. I don't care where.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.044
Jason, Sam...

26:31.215 --> 26:32.921
...help everyone get home.

26:33.092 --> 26:36.209
-Ain't you gonna tell me what happened?
-Not now.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.422
Just get everyone off my lawn.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.429
It's all over now.

26:48.607 --> 26:52.020
Sookie, why do l have this
sick feeling that it's not?

26:54.655 --> 26:55.690
Mama, you're okay.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.445
You're okay, Mama. Mama.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.699
Oh, thank you, God. Thank you.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.532
-Well, how'd we get home?
-You don't remember anything?

27:04.706 --> 27:08.824
Last thing I remember is meeting
that red-headed vampire of yours...

27:09.002 --> 27:10.412
...and then l....

27:17.678 --> 27:21.637
She didn't bite me, did she?

27:21.807 --> 27:24.264
You let a vampire feed on me?

27:24.434 --> 27:27.221
Why on earth would you choose
that girl over your own mother?

27:27.396 --> 27:28.727
I didn't.

27:28.897 --> 27:31.354
I brought you straight back here
right after she...

27:31.525 --> 27:34.062
...did that, and then |--
I haven't spoken to her since.

27:34.236 --> 27:38.570
What sort of evil monster would attack
an innocent person for no reason?

27:39.908 --> 27:42.069
Look, she was kind of...

27:42.244 --> 27:43.825
...provoked.

27:44.538 --> 27:46.278
It wasn't you.

27:46.456 --> 27:48.663
Whatever it was
that had control over you...

27:48.834 --> 27:51.576
...it made you say a bunch
of things you didn't mean.

27:52.296 --> 27:54.503
-Well, like what?
-Spiteful stuff.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.755
About Jessica.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.506
About me.

27:59.595 --> 28:00.880
And Daddy.

28:01.054 --> 28:03.431
Lies about how he shot himself.

28:13.442 --> 28:15.433
That's not true, right?

28:18.030 --> 28:19.236
It was a burglar.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.740
Oh, you're nearly 30.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.371
You should know the truth.

28:33.503 --> 28:36.245
I should have known the truth
when l was 10!

28:37.758 --> 28:39.965
Or, hell, when l was 25.

28:40.135 --> 28:42.421
All these years
you keep me from moving out...

28:42.596 --> 28:44.632
...you keep me from going to college...

28:45.307 --> 28:46.717
...from doing anything...

28:46.892 --> 28:50.055
...all because you were scared
of some burglar that never existed.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.805
l was scared.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.267
I'm still scared.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.317
Hoyt...

28:56.485 --> 28:58.726
...you're all I got left.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.316
I had to hang on to you.

29:02.407 --> 29:06.491
You lied to me for 18 years...

29:07.204 --> 29:09.661
...just because you didn't want
to be alone...

29:09.831 --> 29:11.992
...instead of letting me
be an actual person.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.667
You know what I wish?

29:17.339 --> 29:21.173
Mama, lwish that Jessica
had finished you off.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.603
I'm sure you're-- You're just asleep.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.984
Oh, God, I pray you're asleep.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.861
Mama's gonna be home real soon, okay?

29:44.032 --> 29:45.897
I love you.

29:46.076 --> 29:49.364
That's the third call.
Why aren't they picking up?

29:49.538 --> 29:51.574
Yeah, come on. Let's walk.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.363
Whoa, Arlene...

29:53.542 --> 29:54.873
...I can give you a lift.

29:55.043 --> 29:59.082
-My truck's just down the road.
-Oh, could you? Oh, God bless you.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.798
What is it?

30:08.765 --> 30:09.971
|think--

30:10.142 --> 30:12.599
I think I found my finger.

30:12.769 --> 30:15.306
Holy Moses. How the hell did you--?

30:17.482 --> 30:19.018
It's okay.

30:19.526 --> 30:22.893
Arlene, you mind if Jane comes with us?

30:23.071 --> 30:24.902
We need to get her to the ER.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.153
Of course.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.906
How the fuck did I get here?

30:28.076 --> 30:31.614
Come by the station in the morning
and I'll give you your badge back.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.403
Really?

30:34.207 --> 30:35.913
I won't let you down, Bud.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.575
And I am never touching
another drink again.

30:38.754 --> 30:40.290
This town's a hell of a mess...

30:40.464 --> 30:43.581
...and I'm man enough to know
I can't shoulder it myself.

30:44.051 --> 30:46.258
You might have your faults, Andy...

30:46.428 --> 30:49.340
...but at least you got pants on.

31:06.073 --> 31:09.361
I wanted to thank you
for trusting me with your life.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.200
That couldn't have been easy.

31:12.371 --> 31:15.078
Well, Sookie's safe.
You got what you wanted.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.624
You wanted it too.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.955
Well, she's family.

31:22.464 --> 31:23.954
But they all are.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.882
If there was a way to save them,
how could I say no?

31:28.470 --> 31:30.802
I am grateful
that you would reveal your gift...

31:30.972 --> 31:32.803
...for the sake of the town.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.260
It took me this long to realize it...

31:35.435 --> 31:38.802
...but you suffer more hiding something
than you do if you face up to it.

32:01.169 --> 32:03.831
Where's Maryann?
She's gotta know what happened.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.792
We're okay. That's all that matters.

32:06.967 --> 32:09.333
Blood on my hands is not okay, Tara.

32:10.804 --> 32:13.170
Sookie helped me remember
some of the things I lost.

32:13.723 --> 32:17.181
And | wish I could forget it again.
There's things you don't want to know.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.012
How do you know
I don't wanna know them?

32:22.190 --> 32:23.600
All that stuff's in the past.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.857
Why dwell on it?
Can't we just start fresh?

32:28.447 --> 32:31.154
Fuck, there's blood under my fingernails.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.825
Hey.

32:33.535 --> 32:35.776
Finally got everyone home.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.785
Did Bill come in?

32:38.457 --> 32:40.664
I think he went upstairs.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.251
Is he okay?

32:46.923 --> 32:48.299
Are you okay?

32:48.467 --> 32:49.707
Yeah, ljust....

32:51.887 --> 32:55.175
I'm so sorry for bringing
all this craziness into your house.

32:56.433 --> 33:01.097
I got sucked in because she made me feel
like I was a part of...

33:01.605 --> 33:03.470
...like, a family or something.

33:03.648 --> 33:04.933
Hey.

33:05.108 --> 33:07.269
You have a family.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.564
We're family.

33:11.740 --> 33:15.608
And tomorrow, we're gonna clean
every single thing...

33:15.785 --> 33:18.743
...that monster touched in this house.

33:19.164 --> 33:23.407
Oh, my God, is--?
Is Mike Spencer still here?

33:24.252 --> 33:26.243
I kind of knocked him out.

33:26.421 --> 33:27.752
l'll wake him up.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.003
You go on to bed.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.789
Thank you.

33:49.778 --> 33:52.064
How long before sunrise?

33:53.448 --> 33:55.029
Forty-one minutes.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.365
Hold me for 40.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.800
Well, I certainly never expected
anything like that to happen here.

34:23.979 --> 34:25.515
I know.

34:26.314 --> 34:29.602
Hey, thanks for opening today.

34:29.776 --> 34:33.769
I know you didn't have to, but everyone's
grateful for a little something familiar.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.609
It's not just my bar. It's everybody's.

34:36.783 --> 34:38.865
But it's called Merlotte's.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.775
Merlotte is just a name.

34:40.954 --> 34:43.366
Doesn't really say anything
about me, does it?

34:44.499 --> 34:46.785
Mama, we forgive you.

34:47.586 --> 34:50.498
You shouldn't even have to know
what that word means.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.663
Mama, it's okay.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.581
Mr. Merlotte kept us company.

34:54.759 --> 34:58.172
He took us to see some vampires,
and one of them could fly.

35:00.307 --> 35:04.721
Well, Mr. Merlotte's a good man,
but he ain't your family.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.476
I'm the one that should have been there.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.024
I'm so sorry about that, okay?

35:10.191 --> 35:13.024
But I promise you that from now on...

35:13.194 --> 35:15.981
...l'm gonna be the best mama
in the world, okay?

35:16.156 --> 35:17.191
Stick them up.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.658
Tell you what.

35:22.829 --> 35:25.536
You kids keep an eye on
your mama when she's at home...

35:25.707 --> 35:28.198
...and I'll make sure nothing bad
happens to her here.

35:28.376 --> 35:31.334
That way, we can all
take care of each other, okay?

35:31.504 --> 35:33.335
Sure, I guess.

35:33.506 --> 35:35.007
Sounds like a plan to me.

35:36.176 --> 35:37.541
Hey, Arlene. Terry.

35:37.719 --> 35:39.380
We're drowning back here. Come on.

35:39.888 --> 35:43.597
Okay. You can skip
to the ice cream if you want.

35:45.060 --> 35:47.767
Mama? When you went away
for all that time...

35:47.937 --> 35:49.973
...you didn't see Rene, did you?

35:51.024 --> 35:54.516
No. I think he's still on his vacation.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.275
Eat, eat.

35:57.405 --> 36:00.863
-Yep, I'm pretty sure he's dead.
-Yep.

36:01.034 --> 36:05.073
Gas leak, my ass. You know the real reason
no one remembers anything?

36:05.246 --> 36:07.111
It's the way the aliens wanted it.

36:07.290 --> 36:08.575
The what?

36:08.750 --> 36:12.083
"Maryann Forrester" rhymes
with "Martian foreigner."

36:14.255 --> 36:15.995
She's a fugitive from her home planet.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.878
Everyone knows that aliens
erase people's memories.

36:19.052 --> 36:22.260
-ltjust adds up.
-I heard that Maryann Forrester...

36:22.430 --> 36:26.093
...was an agent of the pharmaceutical
companies and the liberal media...

36:26.267 --> 36:30.431
...and she poisoned our water supply
with LSD as a mind-control experiment.

36:30.605 --> 36:34.564
-Like they did to San Francisco?
-Yeah, that's why I stick to Mountain Dew.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.399
-Refi||?
-Please.

36:37.987 --> 36:42.606
You know, between us, the real story? ATF
shut down a distillery in Breaux Bridge...

36:42.784 --> 36:45.867
...last week over a bad batch of vodka.
Pure ethanol.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.197
-No.
-Yeah.

36:47.372 --> 36:50.284
Apparently, that's what they were
serving up last night.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.541
Yeah. Mountain Dew. Smart choice.

36:55.422 --> 36:57.128
I knew it.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.675
God bless who made those jeans.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.959
I'm serious,
l'd wear him like a scrunchie.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.803
Hit me.

37:05.974 --> 37:09.307
Everybody been acting so crazy,
I forgot how stupid they were.

37:09.978 --> 37:10.967
Gobble up.

37:18.111 --> 37:19.317
There it is.

37:19.487 --> 37:22.320
Sook, | feel for you the most.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.026
What? Why?

37:24.200 --> 37:28.159
Because you know what really happened,
and you got to carry the burden of that.

37:28.329 --> 37:30.320
I mean, I'm thrilled I got a choice...

37:30.498 --> 37:32.830
...and I don't ever wanna know.

37:33.001 --> 37:36.664
Don't tell me nothing, even if I beg for it.

37:36.838 --> 37:40.171
I don't think it's healthy for a motherfucker
to know everything he done.

37:40.341 --> 37:44.254
It's like knowing what's in the sausage.
Just eat it. Shit, enjoy it.

37:44.429 --> 37:47.967
Oh, speaking of which,
Jane Bodehouse wants the jambalaya.

37:50.518 --> 37:51.553
I don't know.

37:51.728 --> 37:54.344
It was so traumatic
I must have blacked out...

37:54.522 --> 37:58.561
...but I'm thinking a gator must have
bit it off while I was down at the lake.

37:58.735 --> 38:00.771
I've been doing
a lot of sunbathing lately.

38:01.279 --> 38:04.988
But the doctor who sewed it back on
says I have wonderful bone structure...

38:05.158 --> 38:07.023
...so hopefully it'll take.

38:07.202 --> 38:11.286
Luckily, I use my right hand
for most things.

38:11.456 --> 38:14.198
It wasn't no gator and you
weren't down by the lake.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.115
Andy.

38:16.294 --> 38:19.707
I saw you pull that finger
out of a giant statue of meat.

38:19.881 --> 38:23.044
Just like I saw you getting it
from behind from Mike Spencer.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.223
Oh, Andy.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.052
Whatever you're drinking,
we all want some of that.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.219
It's Diet Coke with lime.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.062
Great.
Used to be they all thought I was crazy.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.899
Now they know I'm telling the truth,
they can't face it.

38:45.323 --> 38:48.406
-Zombie-eyed freaks.
-Hey, let it go, bubba.

38:50.161 --> 38:54.074
Look, you and me both know
we saved her and everybody else.

38:54.499 --> 38:57.491
Come here. We're heroes to this town.

38:58.127 --> 39:01.665
What? They don't remember anything.
We don't remember anything.

39:01.840 --> 39:05.128
-How does that make us heroes?
-We gotta be.

39:05.301 --> 39:07.713
Look, we set out to save this town
from Maryann.

39:07.887 --> 39:11.675
Now today, she's gone,
and everybody's okay.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.303
We must have done something right.

39:14.477 --> 39:17.935
In my book, if no one thinks
we're heroes, it don't count.

39:18.106 --> 39:20.313
Of course it counts.

39:20.483 --> 39:24.271
It's like if a tree falls in the woods.
It's still a tree, ain't it?

39:24.445 --> 39:26.401
The whole point in being a hero...

39:26.573 --> 39:29.155
...is to do something greater
than yourself.

39:29.325 --> 39:32.783
It'd be easy to do it
for the glory or the girls...

39:33.788 --> 39:37.372
...but we're bigger men than that, right?

39:41.296 --> 39:42.627
Yep.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.293
Strange to see you working here.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.082
It's been a while.

39:48.261 --> 39:49.751
It's just like riding a bicycle.

39:50.430 --> 39:55.015
Hey, you think you can keep an eye
on things here without me...

39:55.184 --> 39:57.596
-...for a couple days?
-Why, where you going?

39:58.313 --> 40:02.226
Well, |-- I'm the only one
who hasn't had a break.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.767
And in case you didn't notice,
last night was a little rough for me too.

40:05.945 --> 40:09.654
I don't have the words
to thank you for what you did.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.906
No. It's probably best you don't.

40:13.161 --> 40:16.073
You know, I'm not sure
we want people knowing...

40:17.665 --> 40:18.996
...well, any of it.

40:19.167 --> 40:22.250
Well, | for one wish that everyone
knew how special you are.

40:29.135 --> 40:31.342
Hi. Sookie Stackhouse?

40:31.512 --> 40:34.094
l'm Autumn
from Maison Maribel in Ruston.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.971
Special delivery for you.

40:37.352 --> 40:39.468
-Thank you.
-Lucky girl.

40:39.646 --> 40:41.807
You got one classy admirer.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.147
Can I have a minute?

40:49.322 --> 40:50.687
Sure.

41:25.525 --> 41:28.267
Oh, my God, you scared me
half to death.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.696
I'm sorry, Sookie. ljust--

41:31.239 --> 41:33.150
-I gotta talk to you.
-What is it?

41:33.324 --> 41:35.861
You look like you haven't slept all night.

41:44.419 --> 41:48.037
There's gaps
where I can't remember anything.

41:49.090 --> 41:51.081
But I have to know what I did, and--

41:52.260 --> 41:53.841
Please, Sookie. I need your help.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.798
Oh, I don't know.

41:55.972 --> 41:57.337
It's not as easy as that.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.427
I had blood on my hands last night,
and I can't remember why.

42:01.102 --> 42:04.720
Now, I know I did a lot of terrible things
in my past, but I paid for them.

42:05.857 --> 42:09.691
I thought that was all over.
But if it's not, I got a right to know.

42:10.403 --> 42:13.770
Are you sure? Because Maryann
made a lot of people do a lot of things...

42:13.948 --> 42:17.440
-...they wouldn't ordinarily do.
-Like what? What things?

42:17.618 --> 42:21.702
I can't live with myself
not knowing what I did.

42:21.873 --> 42:24.239
I don 't know who I am
and I don 't know what I am.

42:24.792 --> 42:28.910
You can help me, Iknowyou can help me.
I know it. Please help me. Please help me.

42:29.088 --> 42:30.919
I can't promise it'll work.

42:31.090 --> 42:32.796
I had Bill with me last time.

42:33.593 --> 42:36.130
Please, just tell me what to do.
I want you to find it.

42:36.304 --> 42:38.465
You have to open yourself up.

42:39.307 --> 42:41.969
You have to let me in, okay?

42:44.353 --> 42:45.433
Okay.

42:45.605 --> 42:47.766
Let's go back to your first blackout.

42:47.940 --> 42:49.896
Do you remember that?

42:51.069 --> 42:53.310
-Yeah.
-Okay.

42:53.821 --> 42:55.482
Take me back there.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.442
What's the last thing you remember?

42:58.201 --> 43:00.283
I'm with Maryann in her car.

43:00.453 --> 43:01.989
She's taking me somewhere.

43:04.415 --> 43:05.575
Then it's just blank.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.412
-Concentrate. Let me in.
-l'm trying.

43:09.837 --> 43:11.338
Okay, okay.

43:11.506 --> 43:14.589
You're in the woods.
There's a woman there with a-- A cane?

43:14.759 --> 43:16.340
Yeah. Yeah, I see her.

43:16.511 --> 43:20.003
You're a vessel to the Other World.
You will bring forth my god.

43:20.181 --> 43:23.423
I ain't no vessel.
I don't even know what the hell I'm doing.

43:37.532 --> 43:40.615
It wasn't you. You had no free will.

43:40.785 --> 43:45.154
-I killed people. I cut out their hearts.
-No, listen to me. That wasn't you.

43:45.331 --> 43:46.867
Maryann used you.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.623
But it was my hands.
My hands that did all that.

43:50.002 --> 43:52.709
Please. Don't blame yourself.

43:54.465 --> 43:55.875
Eggs, I'm so sorry.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.171
Eggs!

44:03.683 --> 44:05.389
Jessica.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.394
Hi.

44:08.396 --> 44:09.977
You look quite a vision.

44:11.065 --> 44:13.807
Are you off to see Hoyt Fortenberry?

44:14.402 --> 44:17.485
So what if I am?
You're going to see Sookie, aren't you?

44:17.655 --> 44:19.065
It's fine.

44:19.699 --> 44:23.487
In my day, the gentleman
came to the lady's house to court her...

44:24.412 --> 44:26.073
...but times change.

44:27.582 --> 44:29.743
| see his mother's gone.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.412
He took her home yesterday.

44:32.587 --> 44:33.952
Good.

44:34.130 --> 44:35.620
I hope she's better.

44:35.798 --> 44:38.255
And I hope you and Hoyt
have a nice time.

44:38.426 --> 44:39.586
Thanks.

44:39.760 --> 44:43.548
Actually, we kind of had a little fight...

44:44.599 --> 44:46.885
...but I was gonna go over
and make an apology.

44:48.311 --> 44:51.223
Well, he'd be a fool not to accept.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.930
Where are you going with Sookie?

44:54.108 --> 44:55.348
To a French restaurant.

44:55.860 --> 44:59.318
Do you know I haven't
been to one in over 70 years?

45:00.448 --> 45:01.858
Humans seem to love them.

45:02.742 --> 45:04.949
They-- They go there to celebrate.

45:05.119 --> 45:08.577
Okay. Just be back by 5.

45:08.748 --> 45:09.908
You be back by 4.

45:25.348 --> 45:27.179
Mrs. Merlotte.

45:27.850 --> 45:29.590
Oh, dear God.

45:39.487 --> 45:43.150
You threw away all the pictures of me?

45:43.324 --> 45:45.030
We have them. It's just--

45:45.201 --> 45:47.317
It'd be hard to explain to friends...

45:47.495 --> 45:49.110
...who think we never had children.

45:50.790 --> 45:53.998
-Will you sit down?
-No, I don't plan on staying.

45:54.418 --> 45:56.454
We never thought we'd see you again.

45:56.629 --> 45:58.915
Never say never
when there's the Internet.

46:01.717 --> 46:05.835
Sam, if you came for an explanation...

46:06.013 --> 46:07.344
...I don't have a good one.

46:08.933 --> 46:11.094
Mitchell and l were down
to our last nickel...

46:11.269 --> 46:13.351
...and we were scared.

46:13.521 --> 46:15.512
We still don't know
what we saw that night.

46:17.566 --> 46:19.773
You saw me turn into a dog.

46:20.695 --> 46:23.607
And apparently that was worth
abandoning me over.

46:23.781 --> 46:26.193
So I spent the next 19 years...

46:26.909 --> 46:29.366
...making sure nobody
would know who I really was.

46:30.705 --> 46:32.946
That's what you left me with.

46:33.666 --> 46:35.281
I'm sorry.

46:35.459 --> 46:38.041
I am so sorry, Sam.

46:38.254 --> 46:41.417
-We never meant to hurt you.
-Hey, hey.

46:41.590 --> 46:43.842
I'm not here for an apology.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.711
I wanna find the people
you adopted me from.

46:49.390 --> 46:50.630
I wanna meet my parents.

46:52.268 --> 46:53.383
I can't do that.

46:53.561 --> 46:56.394
-I swore to them I'd never say anything.
-Jesus Christ.

46:56.564 --> 46:58.225
Please. Trust me.

46:58.399 --> 46:59.980
You don't wanna know them.

47:00.151 --> 47:01.891
They're bad people.

47:02.069 --> 47:04.321
Well, I guess you know a thing
or two about that.

48:01.087 --> 48:02.918
Jessica!

48:17.812 --> 48:21.270
No, before we go any further,
there's something you ought to know.

48:21.440 --> 48:22.600
Yeah, what's that, sugar?

48:25.486 --> 48:26.692
I'm a virgin.

48:26.862 --> 48:28.398
Oh, yeah?

48:28.948 --> 48:30.108
That's okay.

48:31.659 --> 48:33.274
I'll be gentle with you.

48:34.245 --> 48:36.327
-In fact, I kind of like it.
-Really?

48:37.581 --> 48:39.321
Well, I don't like it one bit.

49:02.148 --> 49:04.605
Welcome, Mr. Compton.
We are all ready for you.

49:04.775 --> 49:07.391
-Thank you.
-|'|| get the music started.

49:11.031 --> 49:13.864
You rented out the whole place?

49:14.034 --> 49:18.198
The sight of you is not something
I wish to share with others tonight.

49:18.372 --> 49:22.661
Oh, Bill, you didn't have to do
all this for me.

49:22.835 --> 49:25.872
I love nothing more
than to see you happy.

49:27.715 --> 49:29.376
It's really quite selfish.

49:30.843 --> 49:32.674
Well, I know I'm gonna eat...

49:32.845 --> 49:36.178
...but what's there for you to do
at a restaurant besides look at me?

49:36.348 --> 49:38.054
We can dance.

49:38.726 --> 49:40.182
May I?

50:16.805 --> 50:17.931
Andy Bellefleur.

50:22.603 --> 50:25.390
-Hold up. Hold up!
-No,no,no.

50:25.564 --> 50:27.304
Listen, I'm a killer.

50:27.483 --> 50:30.099
I'm a murderer.
l murdered innocent people.

50:30.277 --> 50:32.814
Now, you-- You just have to
look me up, please.

50:32.988 --> 50:35.070
Why don't you put the knife down?
We'll talk.

50:35.241 --> 50:38.608
It's the murder weapon, you dumb fuck!

50:38.786 --> 50:41.027
Voodoo woman, Daphne,
Sam Merlotte.

50:41.205 --> 50:43.070
-| used it on all of them.
-Hold on, now.

50:43.249 --> 50:44.955
You were under Maryann's spell.

50:45.125 --> 50:48.458
But it was me who cut out
those women's hearts, Andy.

50:48.629 --> 50:50.915
Calm down. Calm down.

50:51.090 --> 50:53.581
-Give me that knife--
-Listen to me!

50:54.802 --> 50:56.633
I saw their eyes.

50:56.804 --> 50:58.135
Looking up at me...

50:58.305 --> 51:00.762
...holding this knife out.

51:00.933 --> 51:03.219
That was the last thing they saw, Andy.

51:07.565 --> 51:09.305
He was gonna....

51:14.113 --> 51:15.819
Holy shit.

51:15.990 --> 51:17.981
I ain't never killed nobody before.

51:18.826 --> 51:21.317
-Fuck, this ain't even mine.
-Give it to me.

51:23.831 --> 51:25.662
Give me the gun.

51:28.127 --> 51:30.618
You didn't see anything.
You weren't here.

51:31.005 --> 51:32.791
Get the hell out of here. Go on.

51:32.965 --> 51:34.455
Go!

51:42.308 --> 51:45.846
-Somebody call an ambulance.
-Oh, my God. What happened?

51:46.020 --> 51:48.602
We got a confession from
our killer and a murder weapon.

51:49.398 --> 51:51.514
-He was coming after me...
-Oh, God.

51:52.901 --> 51:54.482
...and I got him.

51:55.529 --> 51:58.191
-Oh, no, Tara, honey, don't.
-Oh, no. No.

51:58.365 --> 52:02.950
No,no,no.

52:03.454 --> 52:05.786
No, please.

52:08.042 --> 52:09.703
Please.

52:17.176 --> 52:18.666
It's a good thing you don't eat.

52:18.844 --> 52:20.835
Because I wouldn't share it with anyone.

52:21.013 --> 52:24.801
I can't think of a better way to top off
the best meal of my life.

52:25.934 --> 52:27.720
I do have one last thing.

52:32.733 --> 52:34.064
Plane tickets?

52:36.570 --> 52:37.901
Where's Burlington?

52:38.072 --> 52:41.439
-lt's in Vermont.
-Vermont? Why would we--?

52:41.617 --> 52:43.573
This is the other part.

52:58.550 --> 53:00.006
Miss Stackhouse...

53:02.096 --> 53:05.179
...will you do me the honor
of becoming my wife?

53:07.643 --> 53:12.057
That is, assuming that last night
didn't scare you off weddings for good.

53:15.859 --> 53:17.395
SooMe?

53:18.654 --> 53:20.360
Say something.

53:21.198 --> 53:24.406
l've dreamed of this since I was a girl.

53:27.037 --> 53:30.950
And in my dreams, I always say yes.

53:31.125 --> 53:33.081
Well, then it ought to be easy.

53:33.252 --> 53:34.867
Then why can't I say it?

53:35.963 --> 53:38.625
My heart's flying around in my chest.

53:38.799 --> 53:41.415
I can't even think straight.

53:42.219 --> 53:44.130
My life's inside-out.

53:44.304 --> 53:48.638
With all that's happened,
I'm not sure about anything.

53:48.809 --> 53:50.470
I don't even know if I'm human.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.845
-What?
-Maybe I am some kind of freak.

53:54.022 --> 53:58.061
I've only met one other person in the world
like me, and who even knows where he is.

53:59.361 --> 54:03.400
And what happens
when I grow old and weak...

54:03.574 --> 54:05.656
...and you're still the same? What then?

54:05.826 --> 54:07.987
Sookie, I don't care about any of that.

54:08.162 --> 54:10.448
I want you just as you are.

54:10.622 --> 54:12.658
But I'm not even sure what I am.

54:16.795 --> 54:19.081
-Are you saying no?
-No. I'm saying....

54:20.674 --> 54:23.165
|-- I don't know what I'm saying.

54:24.261 --> 54:27.253
I need a minute to clean myself up.
I'm sorry.

55:55.435 --> 55:59.178
Yes. Yes, Bill Compton, I will marry you.

56:12.369 --> 56:14.280
Bill?
