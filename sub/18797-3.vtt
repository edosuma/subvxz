00:00.010 --> 00:03.190
David Walker died as a
result of a single stab wound.

00:03.240 --> 00:04.670
We're looking for his killer.

00:04.720 --> 00:06.470
I don't recognise him, I'm afraid.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.790
Do you think there's a
chance that he was a client

00:08.840 --> 00:10.310
when you worked as a prostitute?

00:10.360 --> 00:12.590
Please say you don't
need to tell anyone this.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.390
I'm trying to think of other reasons

00:14.440 --> 00:16.550
why a man would have a
prostitute's address.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.470
It's the same conversation a
wife would have with her husband.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.470
We didn't row and it
didn't get out of hand

00:21.520 --> 00:23.310
and I didn't accidentally kill him.

00:23.360 --> 00:26.350
This travel card was found
in an office desk of his.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.430
That definitely a six,
or could it be a zero?

00:28.480 --> 00:30.390
I didn't ring Zoe's parents, sweetheart.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.990
I would never do something like that.

00:33.040 --> 00:36.270
I just thought your temper
issues were so in the past.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.310
- How much?
- £5,000.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.750
If we tell Janet, we could lose Flo.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.550
Sorry, no. No idea.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.670
I was working in the
city at the time, so...

00:44.720 --> 00:46.790
- As a lawyer?
- Banker, I'm afraid.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.750
I've spoken to the friend
again about David's problems.

00:49.800 --> 00:53.950
He said he'd been abused at his
primary school by a teacher.

So, if David was at primary
school in the mid-'50s,

01:49.520 --> 01:53.750
we'd be looking at a possible
abuser who's, what, in their...

01:53.800 --> 01:57.750
- early 80s now? - Which obviously rules out
any of the people we're currently talking to.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.350
Unless the murder was committed
on behalf of the abuser.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.630
What, the primary school
teacher ordered a hit?

02:02.680 --> 02:05.270
Walker allegedly confronted
him 25 years later.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.510
The teacher could have
been anything by then.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.270
And with everything to lose if
David had gone to the police.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.590
Well, look, let's keep
an open mind about that.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.830
OK, so, Colin Osborne,

02:14.880 --> 02:18.830
he worked at Klein Egerton in the
late '80s, but then he leaves...

02:18.880 --> 02:23.070
very suddenly. It's only about a
month or so before David died.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.270
Now, it's probably a complete coincidence,

02:25.320 --> 02:28.190
- but can you speak to
them, please? - Yeah.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.270
And then Sara Alazi, so, she says

02:31.320 --> 02:36.440
that she was living in Rome between
erm... March and December 1990.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.110
Can you speak to the
border agency and see if...

02:40.160 --> 02:43.150
how we can confirm that?

02:43.200 --> 02:45.190
- Yeah.
- Well, I think...

02:45.240 --> 02:46.910
Yeah, that's it.

02:47.880 --> 02:51.360
Thanks, everyone, go
home now... and sleep.

02:58.440 --> 03:02.310
OK, listen, tell you what, you put
your pyjamas on, brush your teeth,

03:02.360 --> 03:04.270
I'll be back upstairs in two minutes,

03:04.320 --> 03:08.120
you show me what a big grown-up
girl you are, OK? Good girl.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.580
One other option.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.980
You let him go to the police...

03:20.080 --> 03:22.510
.. and then you just deny it.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.470
You're a lawyer, he's a drug addict

03:24.520 --> 03:27.350
who's just had his stepdaughter
taken away from him.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.350
Why on Earth would the
police believe a word he says?

03:30.400 --> 03:33.270
And what if there was CCTV
in the supermarket car park,

03:33.320 --> 03:37.320
- or another witness... - We could
easily check the CC... - No.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.790
Sorry.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.640
But... this is the simplest way.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.960
I love you.

03:57.960 --> 04:00.560
And have you told me everything, Col?

04:02.080 --> 04:04.950
- What do you mean?
- That thing you do...

04:06.080 --> 04:08.280
.. that you've always done.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.310
That part of you you keep from me.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.200
I've told you everything, I promise.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.040
Coming, ready or not.

04:29.480 --> 04:32.480
Tess, I think we should
postpone the holiday.

04:32.920 --> 04:36.150
- Why? - I just think none of us
are in the right frame of mind,

04:36.200 --> 04:39.350
- you won't be able to relax and...
- Why would I not be able to relax?

04:39.400 --> 04:41.910
- Because of what's happening
at your work. - Work's fine.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.470
Why would I not be able to relax?

04:43.520 --> 04:46.720
Do you know what he said
to her before we arrived?

04:47.080 --> 04:49.910
- About wanting to hurt someone?
- Listen...

04:49.960 --> 04:52.430
Jason is angry and confused.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.150
And I get that, of course I do,

04:54.200 --> 04:57.230
and you also have to get how
that might spook a 15-year-old.

04:57.280 --> 05:00.910
Well, yeah, maybe, until her dad
very quickly reassured her that

05:00.960 --> 05:04.270
Jason is simply trying to process
an incredibly traumatic event.

05:04.320 --> 05:07.270
And that, actually, he is the gentlest...

05:07.320 --> 05:10.560
kindest man in the world,
which obviously you did, yeah?

05:13.120 --> 05:14.910
Sure.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.440
Yeah. Good.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.670
And are you OK?

05:22.040 --> 05:23.390
Ch...

05:23.440 --> 05:24.710
I'm as fine as a woman

05:24.760 --> 05:28.510
who's just learnt her late husband
was murdered is ever gonna be.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.960
Paul, you don't seem to be
really understanding that.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.000
Well, no.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.710
No, I have to admit I am finding
certain things a little surprising.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.830
Oh, right. Well, what things are those?

05:40.880 --> 05:42.950
Well, this all happened
nearly 30 years ago,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.200
it's another lifetime ago...

05:45.720 --> 05:47.670
.. but it seems to be
really affecting you.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.430
Oh, right, OK. And there's
a manual, is there,

05:50.480 --> 05:52.350
on how to deal with something like this?

05:52.400 --> 05:54.190
Am I not following the manual, Paul?

05:54.240 --> 05:56.110
I don't know, but...

05:57.600 --> 05:59.990
.. I have to admit, you are...

06:00.040 --> 06:02.880
beginning to ever-so-slightly scare me.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.230
Scare you?

06:06.280 --> 06:09.980
And I'm wondering if there's
anything you need to tell me.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.320
No.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.340
There's nothing I need to tell you.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.060
Sara, how nice to see you.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.760
Is everything OK? Sara?

06:56.920 --> 06:58.200
Hello.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.320
I'll come down. Thank you.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.390
- Jason?
- Hi.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.310
Hi, er... I'm DCI Cassie Stuart,

07:20.360 --> 07:23.670
I'm leading the investigation
into your father's death.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.660
Can I just say how sorry
I am for your loss?

07:27.120 --> 07:28.860
Erm... thank you.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.110
Would... Would you like to erm...

07:33.160 --> 07:35.550
go and find somewhere a bit more private?

07:35.600 --> 07:38.600
No, I just... I just wanted to
know when I could visit him.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.120
Right.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.240
Are you really sure that's a good idea?

07:51.480 --> 07:53.750
He's my dad.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.540
No, I understand.

07:56.760 --> 08:00.680
Better surely to...
remember him how he was.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.200
Except I don't... hardly...

08:05.200 --> 08:07.470
.. remember him how he was.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.830
I mean, my mum made me a
memory box after he went,

08:10.880 --> 08:13.350
with lots of stuff of his in it...

08:13.680 --> 08:17.350
.. and there's a jumper in it that I
used to smell to remind me of him.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.270
Except it's gone now, the smell.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.460
I used it all up, I guess.

08:23.360 --> 08:28.030
And I actually need to... see him.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.680
I just... I just wanna be with him.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.380
OK? I want to say goodbye.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.840
Can you leave this with me?

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Have you got a number
I can call you back on?

08:51.480 --> 08:54.070
Yeah, erm... use the mobile.

08:54.120 --> 08:57.220
Right. I'll come back
to you as soon as I can.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.710
Thank you, DCI Stuart.

09:01.760 --> 09:05.600
Cassie, please, and really,
there's no need for thanks.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.840
All right, see you.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.590
And what year would that
have been, Mr Gregory?

09:25.640 --> 09:28.150
Er... well, from when he was about seven

09:28.200 --> 09:31.430
till when the teacher
left... about a year later.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.550
- So, that would be, what, 1958,'59?
- Roughly.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.750
- Did Mr Walker give you
the teacher's name? - No.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.600
Or if he did tell me, I don't remember it.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.630
Sorry to ask this, but did he ever

09:44.680 --> 09:47.670
give you any specific
details about the abuse?

09:47.720 --> 09:49.880
It was bad. Proper...

09:51.120 --> 09:52.920
.. rape and stuff.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.350
Did he ever report it? I mean,
is there any record of it?

09:56.400 --> 09:58.270
As far as I know, he told no-one.

09:58.320 --> 10:02.910
I mean... kids just didn't then,
did they? Just kept it all in.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.950
Now, you said to a colleague
of mine that you...

10:06.000 --> 10:09.270
"often thought it was why he
lived his life the way he did."

10:09.320 --> 10:12.350
- What did you mean by that?
- The women...

10:12.400 --> 10:15.760
the drink and drugs to blot
it all out, all that...

10:16.960 --> 10:19.960
- .. shame and guilt.
- So, he had drug issues?

10:20.280 --> 10:21.790
Yeah, you could say that.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.350
And did he have relationships
outside his marriage?

10:24.400 --> 10:26.880
Yes, he... he did have affairs...

10:28.200 --> 10:31.300
.. but mainly I was
talking about prostitutes.

10:31.760 --> 10:35.110
- Right. - In fact, that's kind of
why we stopped seeing each other.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.710
I wasn't remotely interested
in that sort of thing

10:37.760 --> 10:41.070
and we just kind of drifted apart.

10:41.120 --> 10:44.320
- And this was when?
- Mid-'80s, I guess.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.750
But then in about '87,

10:47.800 --> 10:51.100
he rang me, out of the blue,
and we hooked up again.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.870
We went out for a beer a few times,

10:54.920 --> 10:57.230
which was when he told me about Firdown,

10:57.280 --> 10:58.910
the school where it all happened.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.510
Do you happen to know if
he ever told his wife about

11:01.560 --> 11:03.390
the things that happened to him there?

11:03.440 --> 11:05.790
He told me he'd never been able to.

11:05.840 --> 11:09.190
For whatever reason, the only
people he ever spoke to about it

11:09.240 --> 11:14.040
were me and... when he tracked
him down, the teacher himself.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.910
So you know for a fact that
he actually spoke to him?

11:18.960 --> 11:22.270
He found out where he
lived, went to his house.

11:22.320 --> 11:25.750
- And what did the teacher say?
- Denied it all, of course.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.880
Then got abusive... then threatened him.

12:02.020 --> 12:05.620
My PA was meant to have called
you, I'm so sorry, total cock-up.

12:07.140 --> 12:09.340
But my hands are tied, Tess.

12:10.100 --> 12:13.410
If you have access to any intelligence
relating to the investigation,

12:13.460 --> 12:15.930
and it turned out that you were...

12:16.700 --> 12:18.440
.. in some way...

12:19.940 --> 12:22.540
So, you can take a back-office role.

12:23.420 --> 12:27.300
HR, training, or take some
time off, take some leave.

12:32.140 --> 12:34.140
I'll stay.

12:41.700 --> 12:44.500
This was him about a year before he died.

12:45.540 --> 12:49.260
No, I don't recognise
him, I'm afraid. Sorry.

12:53.620 --> 12:56.650
So, can you think of any reason

12:56.700 --> 13:01.180
erm... why this address might have
been written on a travel card...

13:02.620 --> 13:04.850
.. found in his office desk?

13:04.900 --> 13:06.220
Ooh.

13:08.780 --> 13:11.810
- Absolutely no idea.
- When did you say he died?

13:11.860 --> 13:15.340
We think some time in
about early May 1990.

13:16.860 --> 13:18.770
Well, maybe the person that wrote this

13:18.820 --> 13:21.250
just wrote down the wrong address.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.300
Well, that's certainly a
very real possibility.

13:24.700 --> 13:30.410
So, can I just check if anyone
else was living here in 1990?

13:30.460 --> 13:34.700
Oh, it would have been just me and
my husband. He's passed away now.

13:36.260 --> 13:40.090
Hang on. When was that time
Daddy and I were in America

13:40.140 --> 13:42.140
and Marion broke in?

13:47.500 --> 13:50.570
Mum was winding me up and I
knew it'd annoy the arse off her

13:50.620 --> 13:54.220
to tell her that you meant
more to me than her, so I did.

13:54.620 --> 13:58.090
Which is very sweet of you, Zoe, and
you mean an awful lot to me, too,

13:58.140 --> 14:01.080
but all I'm saying, all
anyone is saying...

14:01.700 --> 14:04.610
.. is we just need to keep
that relationship professional

14:04.660 --> 14:07.460
and within the boundaries of the hospital.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.500
Soz.

14:22.700 --> 14:25.130
- I owe you an apology.
- What for?

14:25.180 --> 14:28.170
It was Zoe who told her parents
about the phone conversation.

14:28.220 --> 14:31.700
Oh, right, not a problem. Listen,
that's not why I'm calling.

14:32.900 --> 14:35.640
A police officer's just been round here.

14:36.580 --> 14:39.490
- Sorry? - Yeah, she'd already
been round to your mum's,

14:39.540 --> 14:42.140
and then Elise gave her our address.

14:43.660 --> 14:46.810
- What did she want? - She said she
was investigating an historic crime

14:46.860 --> 14:50.260
and that she wanted to ask
you a couple of questions.

14:54.540 --> 14:57.530
She didn't tell me anything
more than that, so I rang Elise.

14:57.580 --> 14:59.810
She said she'd been
trying to get hold of you

14:59.860 --> 15:01.970
but your mobile went
straight to voicemail.

15:02.020 --> 15:04.370
- I was on the ward.
- But Elise said she'd told her

15:04.420 --> 15:07.780
that it was about a murder
dating back to 1990.

15:08.940 --> 15:11.880
They've only just found
the body apparently.

15:13.940 --> 15:17.810
So, her married name is Kelsey,
but she was single in 1990,

15:17.860 --> 15:20.090
so can you run a check
under her maiden name,

15:20.140 --> 15:23.490
- which is "Marion Dunphy"?
- OK.

15:23.540 --> 15:25.890
And how did it go with James Gregory?

15:25.940 --> 15:28.450
Interesting. Er... according to him,

15:28.500 --> 15:32.380
David definitely did use prostitutes
and on a fairly industrial level.

15:33.620 --> 15:37.220
Jesus. Do you know, I just...
I met his son this morning?

15:37.580 --> 15:39.650
What a nightmare this is gonna be for him.

15:39.700 --> 15:44.420
- It's gonna get worse. Walker was
into some really weird stuff. - Like?

15:45.860 --> 15:47.610
Violent kind of weird.

15:47.660 --> 15:49.410
Tying up, S&M stuff.

15:49.460 --> 15:53.090
And did Gregory think
his wife knew about it?

15:53.140 --> 15:55.080
Erm... he thinks not.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.930
So, the other possibility is that
he went too far with Sara Mahmoud

15:58.980 --> 16:00.610
and she... she attacked him back,

16:00.660 --> 16:04.980
and then he died as she tried
to defend herself somehow.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.980
Er... OK. OK, can we just be...

16:13.140 --> 16:15.930
.. very careful how we share
this information for now?

16:15.980 --> 16:18.090
- Yeah, of course.
- Obviously, we'll need to

16:18.140 --> 16:21.570
speak to Sara Mahmoud,
again, and Tessa Nixon.

16:21.620 --> 16:22.850
Yeah, I'll set up both.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.970
Oh, and what about
Firdown, David's school?

16:25.020 --> 16:27.960
- Well, I spoke to the
current head. - And?

16:28.340 --> 16:30.730
She was suitably appalled.
I mean, without a name

16:30.780 --> 16:32.490
she wasn't sure how she could help us.

16:32.540 --> 16:34.890
This is abuse that is
alleged to have occurred

16:34.940 --> 16:36.730
about 10 years before pretty much

16:36.780 --> 16:39.010
the oldest current teacher was even born.

16:39.060 --> 16:40.330
Right.

16:41.340 --> 16:44.890
Even identifying a possible suspect
is gonna be as good as impossible.

16:44.940 --> 16:47.050
On top of that, there's
a really good chance

16:47.100 --> 16:50.050
that whoever David Walker was
talking about is already dead.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.570
Hm. Right, OK. I'll see you later.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.930
Colin Osborne and I both
started on the same day,

17:24.980 --> 17:27.210
and we were kids, really.

17:27.260 --> 17:29.890
I'd come straight from
Cambridge, Colin from Kingston.

17:29.940 --> 17:33.490
- They recruited from a poly?
- Oh, they took Colin. - Because?

17:33.540 --> 17:36.690
He got the highest marks in the
aptitude test anyone had ever scored.

17:36.740 --> 17:39.490
- And he went on to do well here?
- He did extremely well.

17:39.540 --> 17:41.090
He worked ridiculously hard,

17:41.140 --> 17:43.770
but more importantly, he had serious nuts.

17:43.820 --> 17:46.410
If he'd stayed, he'd have
ended up running the place.

17:46.460 --> 17:49.050
Did you get any sense of why
he did leave so suddenly?

17:49.100 --> 17:52.290
No, I mean, I worked
with him and I liked him,

17:52.340 --> 17:56.210
but I didn't really know him well,
he was quite a reserved man.

17:56.260 --> 17:59.360
One day, he was here, the
next, he was just gone?

18:00.060 --> 18:02.660
Have you spoken to Colin about this?

18:02.860 --> 18:05.690
Mr Osborne's helping
us with our enquiries.

18:05.740 --> 18:08.850
I'd need to take advice before
answering any more questions.

18:08.900 --> 18:11.930
I'm not sure of our position
on discussing Colin's departure.

18:11.980 --> 18:14.410
What's the best number
for me to contact you on?

18:14.460 --> 18:17.330
Why don't I call you when you've
spoken to who you need to?

18:17.380 --> 18:19.980
What's the best number to get you on?

18:37.820 --> 18:40.890
If you could call us back when you
pick this up, please, Mrs Mahmoud,

18:40.940 --> 18:42.770
it'd be good to talk further.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.290
Thank you.

18:45.900 --> 18:49.530
'If you could call us back when you
pick this up, please, Mrs Mahmoud,'

18:49.580 --> 18:51.850
it'd be good to talk further.

19:13.460 --> 19:14.740
Colin?

19:16.660 --> 19:20.180
Sorry, drifted off for a minute.
Erm... what were you saying?

19:21.300 --> 19:25.450
Er... Janet was just asking if there
are any issues, any difficulties,

19:25.500 --> 19:29.090
anything at all that we feel it
would be useful for her to know.

19:29.140 --> 19:31.340
No, no difficulties at all.

19:34.460 --> 19:36.250
And how we doing at bedtimes?

19:36.300 --> 19:38.580
- Us or Flo?
- Both.

19:40.460 --> 19:42.170
Yeah, no, good as gold, really.

19:42.220 --> 19:45.530
She sleeps really well and is
full of beans in the morning.

19:45.580 --> 19:47.250
And how are her nightmares?

19:47.300 --> 19:49.010
Hasn't had any.

19:49.060 --> 19:52.780
I think everything really changed
when we got her here full-time...

20:25.980 --> 20:29.010
- Hi, there. Marion Kelsey?
- Hello.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.860
DCI Cassie Stuart?

20:31.420 --> 20:33.890
Have you got five minutes
for a quick chat?

20:33.940 --> 20:35.900
Ooh, yes. Yeah, sure.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.730
No, sorry. Who is he?

20:49.780 --> 20:52.060
His name was David Walker.

20:53.980 --> 20:56.780
He ran a small chain of clubs in the '80s.

20:59.100 --> 21:01.570
I've never been a clubber myself.

21:03.380 --> 21:05.490
No, me neither.

21:05.540 --> 21:08.480
- The music's always
too loud for me. - Mm.

21:10.020 --> 21:15.380
Well, obviously, as you know, we've
spoken to your mum and sister...

21:16.420 --> 21:20.410
.. and she seemed to think that you
might have been living in her house

21:20.460 --> 21:23.940
- at some point in early 1990?
- Did she say I broke in?

21:26.140 --> 21:27.570
Well, she did, yes, actually.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.570
My father was on a lecture tour
of America for three months

21:30.620 --> 21:33.220
and I was temporarily homeless, so...

21:33.580 --> 21:36.410
.. I had a key, let myself in
and stayed there for a few days,

21:36.460 --> 21:38.930
- if that's breaking in.
- Sure.

21:39.260 --> 21:40.490
Well, as you say,

21:40.540 --> 21:43.170
it couldn't have been her
that gave that address out

21:43.220 --> 21:46.420
because she was abroad,
so could it have been you?

21:46.980 --> 21:48.220
Sure.

21:49.300 --> 21:51.020
Oh, OK, erm...

21:52.140 --> 21:55.340
.. but you don't have any
recollection of doing so?

21:55.940 --> 22:00.130
- From some time in 1990? No, sorry.
- OK, no problem.

22:00.180 --> 22:05.770
- So, your mum said that you
left home in about 1985? - Yep.

22:05.820 --> 22:08.410
- And you stayed in London?
- Yeah.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.690
Whereabouts?

22:11.240 --> 22:12.910
Various places.

22:14.340 --> 22:16.810
And was 32 Smoke Lane one of them?

22:18.220 --> 22:20.560
I was there for a while, yeah.

22:20.980 --> 22:23.090
This was the address,
in fact, that you gave

22:23.140 --> 22:27.450
after you were arrested in 1988
for assaulting a police officer...

22:27.500 --> 22:28.690
I never assaulted anyone.

22:28.740 --> 22:30.650
.. at a demonstration in North London.

22:30.700 --> 22:33.050
A policeman attacked me,
I was defending myself.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.770
For which you were found guilty

22:34.820 --> 22:38.220
at Horseferry Road Magistrates'
Court and fined £100.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.170
You look like a smart woman to me.

22:44.220 --> 22:46.450
I'm sure you couldn't
be so spectacularly dim

22:46.500 --> 22:49.090
as to suggest that a police
officer from the '80s...

22:49.140 --> 22:52.090
well, fuck it, from any point
in the last 50 years, actually,

22:52.140 --> 22:53.940
couldn't have lied?

22:54.420 --> 22:56.890
I'm not sure why you're
being so defensive, Marion.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.770
I'm being defensive because I
was on a perfectly legal march,

22:59.820 --> 23:03.210
exercising my right to protest, and
I was assaulted by a police officer.

23:03.260 --> 23:06.730
And you're now trying to imply that
I have some kind of violent past,

23:06.780 --> 23:09.370
and that therefore, I must
be connected in some way

23:09.420 --> 23:12.050
to this unfortunate man's tragic death.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.170
And I find that annoying, I'm sorry.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.130
Are we done? Cos I have a very busy ward.

23:16.180 --> 23:17.650
- Sure.
- Great. Nice to meet you.

23:17.700 --> 23:20.800
And you. And if we need
to speak to you again...

23:22.900 --> 23:24.840
.. we'll be in touch.

23:29.280 --> 23:32.910
So, there are no records that can
confirm whether Sara Mahmoud/Alazi

23:32.960 --> 23:34.270
was or wasn't in the UK.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.230
We're checking with all the main airlines

23:36.280 --> 23:37.910
for flights to Rome in March 1990,

23:37.960 --> 23:39.990
but I've been told not to hold my breath.

23:40.040 --> 23:43.310
OK, keep pushing them, we do
need to be able to confirm

23:43.360 --> 23:45.870
where she was at the time
of David Walker's death.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.710
- Absolutely. - I've left her
a message to call us back.

23:48.760 --> 23:52.310
OK. Jake, where are we with the photos?

23:52.360 --> 23:55.150
I went through Tessa Nixon's,
unfortunately, she said

23:55.200 --> 23:58.910
she chucked out most of the ones
of her husband about 15 years ago.

23:58.960 --> 24:02.310
- Why? - "Trying to lay ghosts to
rest," she said. - Or bury them.

24:02.360 --> 24:05.350
And I'm still waiting to hear
back from the Tory Party offices

24:05.400 --> 24:07.430
- about their photo archive.
- OK. Murray?

24:07.480 --> 24:09.550
I spoke to a senior guy
at Klein Egerton today

24:09.600 --> 24:12.550
and there's definitely something
odd about Colin's departure.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.630
I don't know what it is, but I'm
guessing they're gonna close ranks.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.830
- I'm on it.
- Right, good stuff.

24:17.880 --> 24:24.800
OK, following my rather prickly
chat with Marion Kelsey earlier...

24:26.080 --> 24:29.390
.. we ran a tenancy check
on the Smoke Lane address,

24:29.440 --> 24:36.950
and we've found... yes, one
rather... interesting result.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.720
So, this is... Sinead Mary Quinn.

24:41.880 --> 24:46.750
Now, she lived at Smoke
Lane from 1988 to 1991.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.600
And then in 1992...

24:49.640 --> 24:51.550
.. Miss Quinn was in prison for 10 years

24:51.600 --> 24:54.870
for her role in suspected IRA activities.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.590
So, we then went back to
Marion Kelsey's arrest sheet

24:59.640 --> 25:02.310
and discovered that the march she was on

25:02.360 --> 25:03.750
was actually a protest march

25:03.800 --> 25:06.150
campaigning for the release
of the Guildford Four.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.790
So, we have one IRA activist,

25:08.840 --> 25:12.230
we have the murder of a
Tory Party fundraiser,

25:12.280 --> 25:14.350
and linking them both...

25:15.560 --> 25:17.630
.. we have Marion Kelsey.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.840
What did you tell them? What
did you fucking tell them?

25:40.960 --> 25:43.790
Oi. So, since when did
Monster Truck Mayhem

25:43.840 --> 25:46.110
become part of the maths syllabus?

25:46.160 --> 25:48.760
- It's problem-solving, innit?
- Oh.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.830
- Confiscated, mate.
- Dad.

25:51.880 --> 25:55.070
He's addicted to this, we're gonna
have to send him to the Priory.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.630
Omar rang me this morning,

25:56.680 --> 25:59.070
said thank you for not
sticking the petition back up.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.470
I apologised on your behalf

26:00.520 --> 26:02.950
and told him that it must
have been an oversight

26:03.000 --> 26:06.630
and that it would straight
back up first thing tomorrow.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.470
Love?

26:14.520 --> 26:17.120
Yeah, sorry. Back to normal tomorrow.

26:18.080 --> 26:20.920
- It was a joke.
- Sorry, I'm tired.

26:22.760 --> 26:25.430
Do you want help with the interview later?

26:25.480 --> 26:27.480
Yeah, thanks.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.560
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.640
- Hass?
- Yeah.

26:41.880 --> 26:44.790
I do love you.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.430
Well, luckily, I do love you, too.

26:47.480 --> 26:48.800
Lots.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.390
Hey.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.350
What are you doing here?

26:59.400 --> 27:01.340
Nice to see you, too.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.640
- It's our local.
- Our local?

27:06.000 --> 27:07.470
The other kids on the ward.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.950
Just trying to work out how many
things are wrong with that sentence.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.430
They don't serve anyone under 16,
they don't let us get twatted,

27:14.480 --> 27:17.150
and they make us sit out the
back so no-one can see us.

27:17.200 --> 27:21.230
We tell 'em, "What's the worst that
can happen? We've all got cancer."

27:23.960 --> 27:26.510
Have you forgotten what we
discussed this afternoon?

27:26.560 --> 27:29.990
This is hospital grounds. Near as, anyway.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.180
Malibu and orange, please.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.790
She sounded out of control, Tony.

27:42.840 --> 27:46.510
I mean, Mum was completely
petrified, as was I.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.870
I'm so sorry.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.470
We never thought about why
she came back when she did,

27:51.520 --> 27:54.710
we were just so grateful that she did.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.990
But, I mean, you know, you
don't think that she could...

27:58.040 --> 28:01.040
No, no, I don't. She could never have...

28:02.400 --> 28:03.840
No.

28:05.320 --> 28:09.390
- Look, I'll erm... I'll call you
as soon as she gets in, OK? - OK.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.240
- Bye.
- Bye.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.430
'Hi, this is Marion.'

28:20.480 --> 28:23.830
'I can't take your call right
now, please leave a message.'

28:23.880 --> 28:27.470
Why aren't you at home talking
to your husband about it?

28:27.520 --> 28:29.990
Talking to my husband about what?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.800
Whatever it is that's making you unhappy.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.990
Who says I'm unhappy?

28:37.040 --> 28:39.790
You're a 48-year-old woman
necking vodkas on your own

28:39.840 --> 28:42.510
90 minutes after your shift has ended.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.940
Do you think you know me, Zoe?

28:47.600 --> 28:51.400
- No. - Do you really think you have
the first idea of who I really am?

28:52.720 --> 28:55.480
No, but I know fear.

28:56.960 --> 29:00.080
Trust me... I can spot fear a mile away.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.750
Hey.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.740
Hey, it's gonna be OK.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.910
You have no idea.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.430
Marion, please, please don't cry.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.750
- I've gotta go.
- You can talk to me.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.230
Really, can I?

29:25.280 --> 29:28.070
Please, I wanna help you.

29:28.120 --> 29:31.390
You're not my friend, Zoe,
you're not my daughter,

29:31.440 --> 29:34.920
you're just another patient who I'll
forget about as soon as you've gone.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.240
Grow up.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.830
And what did Tessa say?

29:50.880 --> 29:53.280
That she had absolutely no idea.

29:54.380 --> 29:55.830
'And did you believe her?'

29:55.880 --> 29:59.990
Well, it's hard to tell on the phone
but she seemed pretty stunned,

30:00.040 --> 30:03.150
so my guess is that
James Gregory was right,

30:03.200 --> 30:05.790
David Walker never told her
anything about the abuse.

30:05.840 --> 30:09.870
And did she give a reason for why she never
gave us his best friend's name and number?

30:09.920 --> 30:13.350
Well, she said she didn't consider
Gregory to be a close friend.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.950
Which is er... fair enough, I suppose,

30:16.000 --> 30:19.710
given the little contact
that he and Walker had had.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.150
Or she just didn't want us to speak to him

30:24.200 --> 30:26.830
because what he told
us gives her a motive.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.590
Maybe.

30:28.640 --> 30:31.350
Ah, listen, boss, I've gotta go,

30:31.400 --> 30:33.550
I need to shout at my children.

30:33.600 --> 30:36.070
We also need to find Sinead Quinn.

30:36.440 --> 30:38.310
Yeah, first thing.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.700
- Night, Sunny.
- Night, boss.

30:51.040 --> 30:52.630
- Hiya.
- Oh.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.780
- You scared me.
- Ditto. I've been calling you.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.230
Yeah, sorry, my phone was out of juice.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.510
How'd it go with the policewoman?

31:02.560 --> 31:04.760
Oh, yeah. No, it was fine...

31:05.600 --> 31:08.920
- .. I didn't know the guy,
so short and sweet. - Right.

31:11.760 --> 31:14.670
So where have you been? Your shift
finishes at 6:00, didn't it?

31:14.720 --> 31:17.820
I went out with the girls,
we had a few bevvies.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.150
- Right, I'm gonna have a bath.
- Maz?

31:27.840 --> 31:32.200
I've never pressed you, have
I, to talk about the past?

31:33.440 --> 31:36.550
All those years you never
saw your family, I...

31:36.600 --> 31:39.070
I've always just accepted that...

31:39.880 --> 31:43.030
.. it was a part of you that
you didn't wanna re-visit.

31:43.080 --> 31:47.190
But your sister rang and she
said you were so unpleasant today

31:47.240 --> 31:49.310
to her and to your mum...

31:51.640 --> 31:53.840
.. and I need to ask you...

31:54.440 --> 31:57.240
.. is there anything you wanna talk about?

32:01.640 --> 32:05.550
You make the past sound so much more
interesting than it really is, Tony.

32:05.600 --> 32:08.230
Yeah, my parents liked
my sister more than me.

32:08.280 --> 32:10.390
They got her in a way they didn't get me,

32:10.440 --> 32:13.110
and that makes me angry and so we row.

32:14.720 --> 32:17.920
And that's it, I'm afraid,
it's all rather boring.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.990
- Please don't walk away.
- No, I'm tired and I want a bath.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.830
No, Maz. Every time...

32:23.880 --> 32:26.550
all our life, whenever the
conversation gets difficult,

32:26.600 --> 32:29.470
- you just walk away.
- Don't be tedious, love.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.460
Or get nasty. Or both.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.940
You know, one day,
you're gonna come back...

32:39.360 --> 32:41.360
.. and find me gone.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.710
Hiya.

33:12.760 --> 33:15.870
Hiya, love. Sorry, I thought
you'd gone to bed already.

33:15.920 --> 33:18.160
- Good day?
- Yep.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.910
- You? - Yeah, yeah.
You're late tonight.

33:21.960 --> 33:25.360
You said when I was 70, I
could stay out until 11:00.

33:25.600 --> 33:26.870
Sorry.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.750
What were you doing in Winchester, Dad?

33:32.800 --> 33:35.510
I... I accidentally opened
one of your bank statements.

33:35.560 --> 33:39.270
I saw a debit card payment
to South West Trains.

33:39.320 --> 33:42.520
- For a copper, you're a shit liar.
- Yeah, I got it from you.

33:45.640 --> 33:47.790
All right, I'll tell you, but...

33:47.840 --> 33:50.840
I'd prefer not to talk
about it afterwards...

33:51.080 --> 33:54.280
- .. because I know what
you're gonna say. - Deal.

33:56.360 --> 33:59.300
- I was looking for the bloke.
- What bloke?

34:01.200 --> 34:03.400
The one your mum was seeing.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.700
- Are you serious?
- Yep.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.159
OK. Why?

34:16.320 --> 34:19.920
You see, that's... that's why
I didn't wanna tell you...

34:20.199 --> 34:22.270
.. because I knew you wouldn't understand.

34:22.320 --> 34:25.070
I'm just asking why, I'm not
saying I don't understand.

34:25.120 --> 34:28.150
Well, yes, the fact
that you need to ask why,

34:28.199 --> 34:31.360
- you are saying exactly that.
- So, did you find him?

34:34.440 --> 34:38.000
- Oh, I'm gonna go to bed.
Goodnight, love. - Dad?

34:39.199 --> 34:41.270
Dad, don't be like that.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.360
Dad. Dad?

35:03.920 --> 35:06.270
This is it.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.030
There's no more coming.

35:08.080 --> 35:10.190
We don't want any more.

35:10.240 --> 35:11.710
Thank you.

35:25.320 --> 35:29.480
I will be a good father,
Tyler, and I am a good man...

35:31.200 --> 35:34.320
.. but if you ever do anything to
jeopardise our adoption of Flo...

35:35.480 --> 35:39.380
.. if you ever threaten my
family's future happiness again...

35:39.680 --> 35:41.480
.. I will hurt you.

35:41.880 --> 35:44.840
I will hurt you very fucking badly.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.070
What is going on, Colin?

36:03.440 --> 36:05.350
Why didn't you tell me before?

36:05.400 --> 36:08.430
That I was also being interviewed
in connection with a murder?

36:08.480 --> 36:12.190
I was terrified, Simon, and if
Tyler had gone to the police

36:12.240 --> 36:14.150
and told them about me keying the car,

36:14.200 --> 36:17.560
and some sharp-eyed copper had
cross-referenced the two cases...

36:19.840 --> 36:24.030
.. Janet and her department would
be about to finalise an adoption

36:24.080 --> 36:27.230
by a man being interviewed in
connection with two violent crimes.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.710
And we would have lost her, Simon.

36:29.760 --> 36:32.700
But I swear, I know
nothing about this body.

36:33.440 --> 36:37.350
On Flo's life, I have
never heard of David Walker

36:37.400 --> 36:40.360
and I have absolutely no idea how he died.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.590
- Boss?
- Mm, yeah.

36:45.640 --> 36:49.190
I've just got these from
Fulham Party Headquarters.

36:49.240 --> 36:52.110
They erm... had these in old scrapbooks

36:52.160 --> 36:56.230
from the publicity of various
magazines and newspapers.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.790
The er... society sections.

36:58.840 --> 37:03.080
Er... this one is from Hello!
Magazine, the diary section.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.780
But look at the caption below.

37:10.560 --> 37:13.030
"Nightlife supremo David Walker...

37:16.440 --> 37:21.270
.. and party donor Colin Osborne
at the CP Valentine's Day Ball".

37:21.320 --> 37:25.000
The plot thickens, boss. The
plot bloody well thickens.

37:33.260 --> 37:35.930
"So, tell us, Miss Mahmoud,
the recent Ofsted report

37:35.980 --> 37:39.690
identified Highbrook as having
a serious truancy problem,

37:39.740 --> 37:44.370
particularly for the boys
in the 13 to 15 age range.

37:44.420 --> 37:46.250
What measures would you put in place

37:46.300 --> 37:49.100
to help motivate these boys to attend..."

37:50.580 --> 37:51.890
Sara, what's the matter?

37:51.940 --> 37:55.900
You've been acting really weird the last
couple of days. What is it? Talk to me.

37:58.740 --> 38:00.740
Not here.

38:19.300 --> 38:22.980
I honestly have no recollection
of ever having met this man.

38:25.260 --> 38:27.290
OK, er... no problem.

38:27.340 --> 38:31.130
Can we go back then to when
you left Klein Egerton.

38:31.180 --> 38:33.730
When we spoke to you before, you implied

38:33.780 --> 38:37.050
- that you'd just had a
change of heart? - I had.

38:37.100 --> 38:40.490
We then spoke to a Hugh Moray,

38:40.540 --> 38:42.570
who was a colleague of yours at the bank.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.330
We sensed from him that,

38:44.380 --> 38:46.890
actually, there was more
to your departure than that.

38:46.940 --> 38:49.970
- You sensed?
- He seemed reluctant to talk about it.

38:50.020 --> 38:53.810
- Well, he always was a decent guy.
- Because he covered your back?

38:53.860 --> 38:56.260
Because he respected my privacy.

38:57.500 --> 39:00.700
So, when did you start
training to become a lawyer?

39:01.260 --> 39:02.930
Later that year.

39:04.020 --> 39:08.100
That's October 1990,
that's according to your...

39:09.900 --> 39:12.170
- .. company website.
- That sounds about right.

39:12.220 --> 39:14.690
So, what did you do in
the seven months off?

39:14.740 --> 39:17.840
- Where were you living?
- Why does it matter?

39:19.380 --> 39:21.610
OK. It matters, Colin,
because I want to know

39:21.660 --> 39:25.060
where you were and what you were
doing when David Walker was murdered.

39:31.660 --> 39:34.000
You won't know this, but er...

39:35.460 --> 39:37.570
.. my partner and I...

39:37.620 --> 39:41.250
my husband are in the final
stages of adopting a child.

39:41.300 --> 39:45.100
And... whilst I've...

39:46.220 --> 39:49.050
.. I've never been dishonest
with the adoption authorities,

39:49.100 --> 39:54.420
there is one fact that I
haven't told them about.

39:55.860 --> 39:59.050
And I truly believe that
has no bearing whatsoever

39:59.100 --> 40:01.900
on my capabilities as a potential father.

40:09.700 --> 40:13.180
I left Klein Egerton because
I had a breakdown and...

40:14.980 --> 40:18.410
.. from early May until September 1990,

40:18.460 --> 40:23.060
I was sectioned in the Maudsley
Hospital in South London.

40:27.260 --> 40:29.530
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

40:30.540 --> 40:34.500
- And there would be medical records
to confirm this, would there? - Yes.

40:36.460 --> 40:39.010
And you were sectioned
because you were considered

40:39.060 --> 40:40.770
to be a danger to yourself or...

40:40.820 --> 40:43.410
A danger to myself, yes, no-one else.

40:43.460 --> 40:47.090
And this... this breakdown
was caused by what?

40:47.140 --> 40:49.410
I had a history of anxiety...

40:50.500 --> 40:54.860
.. and stress, and erm...
it just came to a head.

40:56.140 --> 40:59.740
Can you remember exactly when
this was, when you went in?

41:02.060 --> 41:05.180
Well, the date you're sectioned
is not a date you easily forget.

41:07.180 --> 41:08.920
6th of May, 1990.

41:17.340 --> 41:19.210
Pretty solid alibi.

41:19.260 --> 41:21.970
Fancy a quick coffee?
Pick the bones out of that.

41:22.020 --> 41:25.530
Yeah. Erm... actually, I've
got a date down here, erm...

41:25.580 --> 41:28.570
so you head back, I'll get the train
and maybe we can discuss later?

41:28.620 --> 41:31.410
Hm. Yeah, no, right. Fine.

41:31.460 --> 41:33.530
I'm sorry, I didn't know if she'd respond.

41:33.580 --> 41:36.780
No, no. I've got to meet
Walker's son anyway, so...

41:37.260 --> 41:39.490
Yeah, we'll talk later.

41:39.540 --> 41:41.890
I can give you a call about 9:00?

41:41.940 --> 41:46.040
- Yeah, only if that suits you.
- Yeah, no, I'm sure it... does.

41:46.180 --> 41:48.460
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

42:00.380 --> 42:02.650
Everything's absolutely fine, I promise.

42:02.700 --> 42:04.730
But do the police think she did anything?

42:04.780 --> 42:06.810
Absolutely not, they just have to ask

42:06.860 --> 42:10.380
difficult questions of anyone who
ever knew him, it's just procedure.

42:12.220 --> 42:13.930
- Do you want a snack?
- No, thanks.

42:13.980 --> 42:16.650
OK. Well, crack on with your revision.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.490
The police came to see me
at the school the other day.

42:32.540 --> 42:35.410
They're investigating the
murder of a man in 1990

42:35.460 --> 42:38.300
who they believed I had a connection with.

42:42.780 --> 42:45.720
And I know nothing about
how he died, but...

42:47.460 --> 42:49.660
.. I probably did know him.

42:53.940 --> 42:55.680
And I knew him...

42:59.540 --> 43:01.080
.. because...

43:02.740 --> 43:05.210
.. many years before I met you...

43:07.620 --> 43:10.500
.. and at a very low point in my life...

43:14.620 --> 43:16.760
.. I'd had sex with him...

43:20.180 --> 43:21.720
.. for money.

44:07.620 --> 44:09.890
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

44:11.180 --> 44:14.180
- Do you want me to come in?
- No, thank you.

44:19.940 --> 44:21.940
Take as long as you need.
