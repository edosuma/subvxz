00:24.520 --> 00:27.364
<i>The history of
man is defined by war.</i>

00:28.920 --> 00:31.127
<i>And war by
the men who fight it.</i>

00:32.360 --> 00:35.125
<i>What if we could
create a better man?</i>

00:35.800 --> 00:37.245
<i>Someone did.</i>

00:38.400 --> 00:42.200
<i>The Agent Program was
initiated in August of 1967,</i>

00:42.280 --> 00:45.011
<i>by a man named
Peter Aaron Litvenko.</i>

00:46.040 --> 00:49.487
<i>Its purpose was to create
the perfect killing machine.</i>

00:49.920 --> 00:54.608
<i>Human beings without
emotion or fear or remorse.</i>

00:56.600 --> 00:59.922
<i>The resulting subjects
were called Agents.</i>

01:01.600 --> 01:04.001
<i>The program was a success.</i>

01:04.160 --> 01:06.447
<i>But the price of
creating men without</i>

01:06.560 --> 01:08.801
<i>humanity was
Litvenko's conscience.</i>

01:09.440 --> 01:13.764
<i>Applying his brilliant mind to his flight,
he vanished.</i>

01:14.000 --> 01:15.604
<i>Fearing that it
would be exposed,</i>

01:15.760 --> 01:17.330
<i>the government
shut down the program.</i>

01:17.960 --> 01:19.962
<i>And surviving Agents
drifted into shadows.</i>

01:22.160 --> 01:25.243
<i>Realizing its potential,
many tried to restart the program.</i>

01:27.680 --> 01:29.523
<i>All failed.</i>

01:31.520 --> 01:35.684
<i>So they focused their efforts
on finding the one man who could.</i>

01:36.200 --> 01:39.090
<i>The task fell to Dr. Albert Delriego.</i>

01:39.840 --> 01:41.842
<i>A ruthless and efficient man.</i>

01:44.200 --> 01:47.841
<i>But Litvenko had disappeared,
and even he couldn't find him.</i>

01:50.680 --> 01:53.809
<i>Then,
six years into his search,</i>

01:53.920 --> 01:57.003
<i>Delriego made
an unexpected discovery.</i>

01:58.840 --> 02:01.127
<i>A single photograph,
which would</i>

02:01.240 --> 02:03.561
<i>become the key to
finding Litvenko.</i>

02:04.920 --> 02:07.685
<i>No one had ever imagined that,
in the end,</i>

02:09.479 --> 02:13.041
<i>it would come down
to one little girl.</i>

02:29.320 --> 02:30.924
Sir,
we have a match in Germany.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.960
Checking surveillance
databases now, sir.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.280
Secure
the files and evacuate.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.445
Sir, we need to leave now.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.321
What the hell is happening?

03:01.440 --> 03:02.521
I don't know, sir.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.809
I want to know who's doing this.
I need answers.

04:56.640 --> 04:57.687
Give me an update.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.643
I said, give me an update!

05:04.320 --> 05:05.321
I said, status!

05:22.200 --> 05:24.123
I suppose
I should be flattered.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.208
I didn't think I
merited a contract.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.486
You don't.

05:32.360 --> 05:35.887
You know,
I hunted an Agent once.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.251
Took four weeks.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.170
Most rewarding
catch of my career.

05:42.880 --> 05:46.566
Your employers are attempting
to restart the Agent Program.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.002
And you are here to stop them?

05:50.560 --> 05:52.210
You are too late.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.047
We already have Litvenko.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.364
He's currently working
on next generation units.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.763
He's not.
Because you haven't found him.

06:05.080 --> 06:08.243
Where is Katia van Dees?

06:10.360 --> 06:12.442
I have a chip implanted here.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.285
If my heart stops beating,

06:15.440 --> 06:18.444
my security detail will
come through the door.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.486
You need me.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.961
No. I only need pieces of you.

06:25.320 --> 06:28.290
The information I require
is in two places.

06:28.440 --> 06:29.885
Your secure database,

06:30.040 --> 06:31.963
and inside your head.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.886
Berlin,
they found her in Berlin.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.291
That's all I know.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.161
Okay, Okay.

06:43.320 --> 06:49.646
File 5-1-7,
access code G21-12-57.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.007
Thank you.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.322
But you won't find her.
She's a ghost.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.970
I will.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.240
Yes?

09:11.320 --> 09:13.322
<i>Delriego is dead.</i>

09:13.800 --> 09:14.801
What happened?

09:14.960 --> 09:16.610
<i>We think it may
have been an Agent.</i>

09:18.320 --> 09:21.085
Delriego was close
to finding the girl.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.802
Get her before he does.

10:16.040 --> 10:19.442
He would have lived in Berlin
between 1989 and 1990.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.967
There must be taxes paid
or rental records or something.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.850
I don't have a name.

10:28.480 --> 10:32.405
Look, he would've
been 49, 50, um...

10:32.560 --> 10:36.201
Blond-haired, 174 centimeters,
75 kilograms.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.526
He's like this.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.480
I'm sorry.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.004
Without a name or an address,

10:52.920 --> 10:54.524
there's nothing
I can do for you.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.011
If he is missing,

10:56.160 --> 10:58.162
may I suggest
you try the police?

10:58.320 --> 11:00.402
The police won't help me.
Why do you think I'm here?

11:00.840 --> 11:03.411
And all you're doing is telling me
what you cannot do.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.681
You have to realize

11:04.840 --> 11:07.047
that millions of people
have lived in Berlin

11:07.200 --> 11:09.089
over the past 25 years.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.887
I can't be expected
to sort through every

11:12.000 --> 11:14.367
one of them for your
mystery man, can I?

11:15.240 --> 11:18.005
It's 19,467,000.

11:18.160 --> 11:22.085
62.2% Slavic origin,
49.2% male.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.682
1.2% between
the ages of 49 to 50.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.127
That's 71,291.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.760
That's something, isn't it?

11:33.080 --> 11:36.289
There's nothing I can do
to help you, miss.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.126
Okay.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.725
Who is he?

11:48.640 --> 11:50.563
This man you have to find.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.649
Who is he to you?

11:54.480 --> 11:55.970
I don't know.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.800
To or from?

13:17.200 --> 13:19.043
<i>Everybody who comes
in here is running.</i>

13:20.120 --> 13:23.329
Either to
something or from it.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.411
I see a lot like you. Runners.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.484
They come to me thinking
a new passport means a new life.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.366
This is no good.

13:37.720 --> 13:40.200
It's perfect.
The data strip's been demagnetized.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.169
The only place this gets me
is a holding cell.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.520
You want better, you pay more.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.487
Or I put word out that Tobias
sells bad paper.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.928
Be careful, little girl.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.441
This world is
a dangerous place.

18:43.320 --> 18:46.449
<i>47, it's Diana. You have company.</i>

18:46.560 --> 18:47.561
Who is he?

18:47.680 --> 18:48.681
<i>A Syndicate asset.</i>

18:49.000 --> 18:50.240
<i>Name, unknown.</i>

18:50.440 --> 18:52.681
<i>Technical capacities, unknown.</i>

18:52.840 --> 18:53.887
He found her.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.087
<i>Means he's good.</i>

18:55.160 --> 18:56.160
You're better.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.168
<i>I'm sure you can handle him.</i>

18:58.680 --> 19:01.081
You have 48 hours
to terminate both targets.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.247
Sorry.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.807
You do know that stealing is a crime,
don't you, Katia?

21:19.600 --> 21:21.568
That is your name, isn't it?
Katia van Dees?

21:21.880 --> 21:23.644
My German's not...
Are you some kind of cop?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.968
No.
How do you know my name?

21:26.120 --> 21:28.407
I'm John. John Smith.

21:28.760 --> 21:29.966
I'd like to buy
you a cup of coffee.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.121
I'm not interested.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.003
How about in living?

21:34.800 --> 21:36.211
Are you interested in that?

21:37.920 --> 21:39.968
Walk away or I'll scream.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.651
He won't care.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.164
<i>He's here to kill you, Katia.</i>

21:54.040 --> 21:55.246
And I'm here to stop him.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.489
I know you don't have any reason
to trust me but look at him.

21:57.640 --> 21:58.766
Look at how he moves.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.041
Look at
the shadows under his coat.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.282
Look at his eyes
and tell me that I'm lying.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.925
Why would anyone
want to kill me?

22:04.080 --> 22:05.127
For the same
reason you're trying to

22:05.200 --> 22:06.440
look for someone
you can't find.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.848
The man I'm looking for,
do you know where he is?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.161
No, but you do.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.000
What do I have to do?

22:18.160 --> 22:20.003
There's a maintenance door,
the north end of the track, one level down.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.606
<i>It's been unlocked for us.
We're gonna head there now.</i>

22:22.760 --> 22:24.205
<i>Go through the corridor
up the stairs to the back alley.</i>

22:24.400 --> 22:25.925
There'll be a car
waiting for us there.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.006
Run!

23:59.400 --> 24:00.401
Move.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.605
Franco, we're coming your way.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.089
Hurry! Hurry!

24:09.040 --> 24:10.041
Where's the Agent?

24:10.120 --> 24:11.884
He's right behind us!
Move! Move! Move!

24:19.400 --> 24:20.561
Katia, are you hit?

24:20.720 --> 24:22.051
Who the fuck are you people?

24:22.200 --> 24:24.123
Calm down, Katia! You're safe.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.244
We've been sent to protect...

24:45.320 --> 24:47.926
I work for a corporation
called Syndicate International,

24:48.080 --> 24:49.366
and I'm here to protect you.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.891
From who?

24:51.040 --> 24:52.565
His name is 47,
and he's an Agent.

24:52.760 --> 24:55.411
And right now the only thing
standing between you and him, is me.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.927
If you don't do everything I say,
everything,

24:58.080 --> 24:59.206
he will kill you.

25:01.560 --> 25:02.560
Let's go!

25:11.080 --> 25:12.764
We'll be safe here.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.131
Can I see some ID, please?

25:19.280 --> 25:21.487
Bags out and open, please.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.165
Drop your weapon!

25:26.320 --> 25:28.163
On the ground!
Hands where I can seem 'em!

25:28.320 --> 25:30.120
- Don't move!
- Get them cuffed!

25:32.160 --> 25:34.003
Come on with me. Let's go.
Grab that bag.

25:35.920 --> 25:36.921
Let's go!

26:03.280 --> 26:05.328
Miss van Dees, is it?

26:08.240 --> 26:09.640
You mind telling
me why you're here?

26:09.720 --> 26:10.801
'Cause your friend in there
wouldn't talk.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.526
He's not my friend.
I don't know who he is.

26:15.120 --> 26:18.044
All right.
Maybe we can start with

26:18.200 --> 26:20.567
why he discharged a firearm
in front of my embassy.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.609
Someone's trying...

26:23.760 --> 26:25.569
I think someone's
trying to kill me.

26:27.480 --> 26:30.848
John was trying to help me.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.448
Does this someone have a name?

26:40.760 --> 26:42.842
Is something wrong,
Miss van Dees?

26:45.240 --> 26:46.446
Miss van Dees!

26:47.640 --> 26:48.641
He's coming.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.081
Shit.

27:07.680 --> 27:08.841
Freeze!

27:09.000 --> 27:10.206
Hands in the air!

27:14.240 --> 27:15.241
Sanders.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.924
Blaser R93 LRS2.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.329
Custom configured
right-hand twist.

27:37.880 --> 27:42.727
4-24x50 sniper scope, and...

27:44.240 --> 27:45.241
...hair trigger.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.441
Very nice.

27:47.680 --> 27:48.720
Come here.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.089
<i>Almost as nice
as the twin .45s,</i>

27:51.240 --> 27:54.881
<i>and these very special knives
you walked in here with.</i>

27:56.320 --> 27:58.049
<i>You like riddles?</i>

27:58.680 --> 27:59.681
<i>Yeah, me neither.</i>

28:00.480 --> 28:02.369
I hate 'em, actually.

28:02.520 --> 28:05.888
<i>But you, my friend,
are a riddle to me.</i>

28:06.080 --> 28:07.684
<i>'Cause I've run your
face and your prints</i>

28:07.800 --> 28:09.450
<i>through every database we have.</i>

28:09.840 --> 28:11.285
And you know what we found?

28:12.240 --> 28:13.321
Nothing.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.680
So

28:19.080 --> 28:21.924
<i>why don't we
start with your name?</i>

28:23.040 --> 28:24.530
47.

28:25.720 --> 28:26.721
That's not a name.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.004
No, but it is mine.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.771
Okay.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.601
All right, Mr. 47.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.410
What exactly are you?

28:37.880 --> 28:39.120
An assassin.

28:39.840 --> 28:42.411
An assassin. Okay.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.490
You're here to
kill who exactly?

28:46.320 --> 28:47.765
You have a girl here.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.644
I don't know what
you're talking about.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.243
Do you love your family?

28:54.600 --> 28:55.601
My family?

28:55.760 --> 28:56.921
Yes, your wife,

28:57.360 --> 28:59.203
your two small children.

28:59.680 --> 29:00.920
Do you love them?

29:02.080 --> 29:04.128
We're not talking about me,
we're talking about you.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.444
No, we're talking about life.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.085
And death.

29:08.240 --> 29:11.084
Do you love them?

29:12.960 --> 29:14.246
All right.

29:14.440 --> 29:15.771
Maybe we should
just start over.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.888
I believe you do.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.328
That's why you
should let me go.

29:22.680 --> 29:25.047
You listen to me
very carefully, Mr. 47,

29:25.200 --> 29:27.601
or whatever
the fuck your name is.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.450
There's a lot of
ways this thing can end,

29:29.560 --> 29:31.005
and that is
entirely up to you.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.885
But you can be goddamn certain that
this thing is not gonna end

29:34.080 --> 29:35.411
the way that you
thought it was.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.210
'Cause the last
time I checked,

29:37.360 --> 29:38.560
you're locked in here with me,

29:39.320 --> 29:40.481
and I'm the one with the gun.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.604
No, Mr. Sanders.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.766
You are locked
in here with me,

29:47.920 --> 29:50.651
and you just brought me mine.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.840
Do you love your children
enough to die for them?

30:26.320 --> 30:27.321
Freeze!

30:33.840 --> 30:35.922
Let's go.
Let me help you.

30:40.400 --> 30:43.165
<i>Two suspects,
one male, one female,</i>

30:43.360 --> 30:45.727
<i>have broken out of
Interrogation Rooms 1 and 2.</i>

30:46.600 --> 30:49.570
<i>They are armed and dangerous.
Proceed with caution.</i>

30:55.960 --> 30:57.007
Sergeant.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.569
Is everything all right, sir?

31:01.960 --> 31:03.086
Sir?

31:05.360 --> 31:06.805
Hurry! Hurry!

31:16.800 --> 31:17.847
Get out!

31:18.160 --> 31:19.161
Move!

31:37.120 --> 31:38.804
You want to tell me
what's happening now?

31:40.280 --> 31:42.089
What the fuck is happening?

31:43.560 --> 31:46.530
The man you're looking for,
his name is Peter Aaron Litvenko.

31:46.680 --> 31:47.841
Who is he?

31:49.640 --> 31:50.846
Your father.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.205
<i>Tell me about him.</i>

31:56.680 --> 31:58.091
I don't know much.

31:58.240 --> 32:01.528
Only that he's a geneticist,
an expert in human biogenetics

32:01.680 --> 32:03.921
who spearheaded
a program of experimentation.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.524
What kind of experiments?

32:06.920 --> 32:08.843
The kind that created killers.

32:10.280 --> 32:14.524
<i>They engineered human beings
by targeting and enhancing specific genes.</i>

32:14.680 --> 32:16.921
The resulting subjects
were stronger, faster,

32:17.120 --> 32:18.724
more intelligent
than normal people.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.487
They programmed
out pain, fear.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.085
<i>Even love.</i>

32:23.240 --> 32:24.969
<i>They were called Agents.</i>

32:25.320 --> 32:27.926
And your father was one of
the program's lead scientists.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.329
You're not serious.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.602
<i>What does any of
this have to do with me?</i>

32:32.800 --> 32:34.086
<i>Why do they want to kill me?</i>

32:34.240 --> 32:36.527
Kryton Technologies has restarted
the Agent Program.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.085
<i>They're building
Agents right now.</i>

32:38.240 --> 32:40.322
<i>Like 47, maybe worse.</i>

32:40.520 --> 32:42.841
They believe that you're the key
to finding your father.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.451
<i>I don't understand.</i>

32:47.600 --> 32:48.886
<i>Your father
knows their weakness.</i>

32:49.040 --> 32:50.883
He knows how to stop them.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.087
Katia!

33:39.840 --> 33:41.080
Are you okay?

33:41.200 --> 33:42.486
No.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.683
Is your name
really John Smith?

33:52.520 --> 33:54.602
It's Brian.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.841
Well, at least you didn't say
it was Agent 46.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.286
No, that's someone else.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.291
Come here. Let me help you.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.002
You're gonna be all right.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.081
Will I?

34:29.639 --> 34:31.369
I'm sorry.

34:31.520 --> 34:32.646
For what?

34:33.159 --> 34:35.322
For having to tell you
who your father is.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.369
Well, you told me the truth.

34:38.719 --> 34:41.371
That's more than anyone's
ever done for me.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.525
Why do they think I
can find him, John?

34:45.920 --> 34:47.001
It doesn't matter now.

34:47.159 --> 34:48.161
It does.

34:49.360 --> 34:51.408
Tell me what you know.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.683
I know that you're in danger.

34:55.679 --> 34:57.887
The best thing
you can do right now is hide.

34:58.040 --> 35:00.281
I've been hiding
my entire life.

35:00.440 --> 35:01.640
Please, tell me what you know.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.848
I'm authorized to
protect you, Katia,

35:07.040 --> 35:09.520
not find your father.

35:17.840 --> 35:18.840
Don't do this.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.211
I have to.

35:20.760 --> 35:21.807
Okay.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.807
When we were researching your father,
we found a file.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.284
It mentioned you.
It said that...

35:32.040 --> 35:33.280
Said What?

35:33.760 --> 35:35.410
It said that he changed you.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.811
Changed me how?

35:37.960 --> 35:40.964
It said that he had enhanced
your survival skills.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.883
It's why we think
you've been hiding.

35:44.040 --> 35:46.088
It's why we think you've been
able to keep off the radar.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.640
It's why we think you've been able
to stay alive for so long.

35:49.320 --> 35:50.685
That's why I'm always afraid.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.245
Yes.

35:55.560 --> 35:56.561
Jesus!

35:57.080 --> 35:58.969
They think I know how
to find my father.

36:04.760 --> 36:05.921
What is this?

36:06.080 --> 36:07.764
It's my father's life.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.764
What else do you
know about him?

36:18.920 --> 36:20.285
Just what I've told you.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.761
You must have
something. How old is he?

36:22.920 --> 36:24.160
72.

36:24.320 --> 36:25.765
Where was he born?

36:25.920 --> 36:27.126
Ukraine.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.366
Medical conditions?

36:30.520 --> 36:34.047
He was diagnosed with
rheumatoid arthritis in his 40s.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.771
Somewhere warm, then.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.281
What else?

36:40.480 --> 36:41.606
Lung cancer.

36:45.640 --> 36:49.804
Our last confirmed sighting was a hospital
in Seoul, South Korea in 2011.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.288
He was engaged
with some clinical trials

36:53.480 --> 36:56.802
for something called
nanoparticle inhalation therapy.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.960
He was Stage III then.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.802
So, uh,
travel would be difficult.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.644
Does he have money?

37:09.480 --> 37:10.811
We think so.

37:11.480 --> 37:14.165
Somewhere warm with advanced
medical facilities.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.004
A city.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.400
Hobbies?

37:21.400 --> 37:22.845
What did he love to do?

37:23.160 --> 37:24.207
Orchids.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.048
He was an expert on orchids.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.162
What languages
did he speak, John?

37:35.680 --> 37:39.526
Uh, English,
Russian, Mandarin and Tamil.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.080
Why Tamil?

37:43.280 --> 37:46.250
Because your mother
was from Sri Lanka.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.240
You know where he is, don't you?

38:08.880 --> 38:10.041
Katia.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.086
You told me you
wanted to do this,

38:14.200 --> 38:15.520
and I told you
I'd do it with you.

38:15.640 --> 38:18.564
But if you want my help,
you have to tell me where he is.

39:00.240 --> 39:02.083
<i>We've lost the girl.</i>

39:02.680 --> 39:07.083
I thought you told me that
your John Smith would be adequate.

39:07.800 --> 39:10.280
<i>We underestimated this Agent.</i>

39:11.600 --> 39:15.127
Find Litvenko,
whatever it takes.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.285
And Garad,

39:17.440 --> 39:21.650
better the girl dead than this Agent
finding Litvenko before we do.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.161
Katia.

39:30.800 --> 39:31.801
Katia.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.201
Do you know why
you're still alive?

39:48.120 --> 39:50.487
Because I chose
not to kill you.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.246
But they will.

39:57.160 --> 39:58.680
After they use you
to find your father.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.003
What do you know
about my father?

40:04.160 --> 40:05.685
As much as you do.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.560
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

40:10.080 --> 40:11.491
<i>No!</i>

40:16.320 --> 40:18.004
Time to make a choice, Katia.

40:18.720 --> 40:21.246
Them or me.

40:24.320 --> 40:25.890
Why should I trust you?

40:26.040 --> 40:29.681
You don't have to.
Just trust your memories.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.009
Take my hand.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.846
Do you remember the day
you ran away, Katia?

40:38.960 --> 40:39.960
<i>Peter, we have to go!</i>

40:40.040 --> 40:43.249
Your father's lab?
The car rides?

40:46.440 --> 40:47.441
<i>It's okay.</i>

40:47.520 --> 40:48.520
The last time you saw

40:48.560 --> 40:49.561
your mother?

40:49.680 --> 40:52.081
<i>No! No, no, no!</i>

41:00.920 --> 41:01.967
You were there.

41:03.720 --> 41:04.767
<i>Yes.</i>

41:06.400 --> 41:08.880
<i>We were part of
the same program.</i>

41:18.560 --> 41:20.562
<i>We need to go.
Quick!</i>

41:23.600 --> 41:24.601
<i>Run! Quick!</i>

41:25.320 --> 41:27.004
<i>Now, get down.
Get down, please!</i>

41:27.080 --> 41:28.080
<i>Papa!</i>

41:28.120 --> 41:31.010
<i>You will live.</i>

41:39.080 --> 41:41.481
He left me. Why?

41:42.600 --> 41:45.524
Find him.
You can ask him yourself.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.241
Untie me.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.764
You have a lot
to learn, Katia.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.604
We don't have a lot of time.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.091
Untie yourself.

43:13.840 --> 43:15.365
That took you too long.

43:15.520 --> 43:17.010
I didn't
know that was a test.

43:17.160 --> 43:18.685
Everything is a test.

43:18.840 --> 43:21.207
Keep taking these,
you'll fail.

43:21.560 --> 43:22.766
Hey, I need those.

43:22.920 --> 43:24.729
What you need is a clear head.

43:25.080 --> 43:26.684
Stop fighting what you are.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.046
And what am I?

43:28.200 --> 43:29.850
Keep asking questions,
probably dead.

43:30.960 --> 43:32.610
What am I?

43:33.200 --> 43:35.521
You're the same
as me, only better.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.922
Bullshit!
I'm just Katia van Dees.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.520
You speak French, Spanish, Mandarin.
Where did you learn them?

43:40.600 --> 43:42.523
How did you free
yourself from the rope?

43:44.200 --> 43:46.043
You've been programmed.

43:47.280 --> 43:48.725
And your name
isn't Katia van Dees.

43:48.880 --> 43:51.770
It's <i>"Quatre-vingt-dix."</i>
French for "90."

43:53.240 --> 43:55.561
So I'm 43
versions better than you?

43:57.560 --> 43:58.641
Do they know?

43:58.720 --> 44:00.563
If they knew,
you'd be the target.

44:00.720 --> 44:01.721
Come on, let's go.

44:09.160 --> 44:11.128
If you need my help
to find my father,

44:11.440 --> 44:13.442
why did you shoot me?

44:13.760 --> 44:16.764
I didn't shoot you,
I marked you.

44:21.240 --> 44:22.480
There are so many.

44:22.680 --> 44:23.920
If I shoot one,
the rest will converge.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.684
So what do we do, Katia?

44:26.760 --> 44:27.761
Avoid them.

44:28.240 --> 44:31.767
No. Suppress your fear,
face the threat.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.171
Your father programmed you

44:35.360 --> 44:38.489
to see and hear everything
at extremely heightened levels.

44:41.840 --> 44:45.083
You process that information
to anticipate the threat.

44:51.800 --> 44:53.131
So, anticipate it.

45:08.320 --> 45:09.845
Katia.

45:15.120 --> 45:16.645
There.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.600
<i>Area Four, all...</i>

45:58.920 --> 46:00.046
Katia.

46:02.400 --> 46:03.447
Now.

46:10.200 --> 46:11.850
I need you to step out there.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.126
Why?

46:13.840 --> 46:15.046
To draw them toward you.

46:15.400 --> 46:16.845
They're going to shoot me!

46:18.040 --> 46:19.530
They're not gonna shoot you.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.689
Do you want to see
your father again?

46:27.360 --> 46:29.044
Trust me.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.440
<i>I have a visual target, locked.</i>

46:39.560 --> 46:40.607
Moving in.

46:48.240 --> 46:49.321
Hello, Katia.

46:55.880 --> 46:57.564
I'm only going
to ask you once.

46:57.720 --> 46:59.131
Where is your father?

47:04.000 --> 47:06.924
I want you to know,
I'm a big fan of your work, 47.

47:07.080 --> 47:09.242
It's an honor
to meet a legend.

47:10.760 --> 47:13.411
I thought you could only be
a legend after you were dead.

47:13.600 --> 47:15.409
Oh, but you are.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.523
You just don't know it yet.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.967
I feel pretty good
for a dead man, John.

47:22.120 --> 47:23.485
Almost as good as you.

47:23.640 --> 47:24.641
Yeah?

47:25.640 --> 47:27.483
Well,
the thing is, I'm special.

47:28.080 --> 47:29.127
Let's see.

47:49.880 --> 47:51.120
Pretty crazy, huh?

48:13.240 --> 48:14.651
I'm better. Say it.

48:16.960 --> 48:18.530
Say it!

48:19.640 --> 48:21.005
You're not.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
You missed.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.371
No, she didn't.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.365
<i>He made a mistake.</i>

48:53.520 --> 48:54.965
<i>He had a gun
at your head.</i>

48:55.160 --> 48:56.207
And he didn't pull
the trigger.

48:56.280 --> 48:57.805
He wanted me to know
he'd beaten me.

48:57.960 --> 48:59.485
What the fuck was he?

48:59.640 --> 49:01.927
People don't just walk away
from four bullets.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.201
They just don't.

49:03.280 --> 49:06.124
Subdermal titanium body armor.

49:06.280 --> 49:08.362
It's injected into the skin
in liquid form.

49:08.520 --> 49:10.648
It's flexible
and extremely strong.

49:10.840 --> 49:14.481
He had his nervous system
heightened. Wired for speed.

49:15.360 --> 49:17.931
I've heard of these
Syndicate experiments...

49:19.040 --> 49:21.805
but if they can do this
with him...

49:25.040 --> 49:28.123
Now will you tell me
where Litvenko is?

49:28.800 --> 49:31.087
Swear to me that
you're not gonna hurt him.

49:32.160 --> 49:33.730
<i>Swear it.</i>

49:33.880 --> 49:35.245
<i>All right,
I swear it.</i>

49:36.640 --> 49:38.051
<i>Diana, did you hear that?</i>

49:38.240 --> 49:41.369
I did.
Send me a link to the asset.

49:42.400 --> 49:44.880
If you lie to me,
I will kill you.

49:45.600 --> 49:48.126
I'm not that easy to kill.

49:52.480 --> 49:54.403
He's in Singapore.

49:56.280 --> 49:58.965
The Syndicate headquarters
are in Singapore.

49:59.720 --> 50:01.370
<i>He's hiding in plain sight.</i>

50:27.960 --> 50:29.564
Yes?
<i>It's Diana.</i>

50:29.720 --> 50:31.643
<i>I need you in Singapore
as soon as possible.</i>

50:31.840 --> 50:33.330
I'm on my way.

51:16.680 --> 51:18.011
Yes?

51:18.160 --> 51:20.128
Litvenko's in Singapore.
They're on their way.

51:22.360 --> 51:25.603
They're coming.
Scan every entry point.

51:26.040 --> 51:27.087
Yes, sir.

51:45.880 --> 51:48.201
The Syndicate's tied
to those cameras, isn't it?

51:48.360 --> 51:50.169
They're tied to everything.

51:51.280 --> 51:54.090
Can you hold this, please?
Thank you.

51:54.400 --> 51:56.209
How do you fight against that?

51:56.360 --> 51:58.681
By playing the odds,
doing the unexpected.

51:58.880 --> 51:59.881
Take nothing for granted.

51:59.960 --> 52:02.008
Everything you do
has a reason.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.924
What does that mean?

52:04.720 --> 52:07.007
Jacket. Give me your bag.

52:07.160 --> 52:10.004
Right now,
it means avoid those cameras.

52:11.040 --> 52:12.041
Okay.

53:46.360 --> 53:48.886
I know, that took me too long.

53:53.320 --> 53:55.288
Ask you a question?

53:55.440 --> 53:57.807
Am I going to end up like you?

54:30.880 --> 54:31.881
Bombs?

54:33.240 --> 54:34.526
Moths.

54:35.120 --> 54:36.849
It's Italian wool,
they love it.

55:19.840 --> 55:21.126
Did it hurt?

55:24.240 --> 55:25.924
Yes.

55:26.520 --> 55:28.010
Do you all...?

55:28.160 --> 55:30.845
The barcode is given to us
when we're born.

55:32.760 --> 55:33.761
And the number?

55:33.920 --> 55:35.729
When we become Agents.

55:51.320 --> 55:54.005
He'll be there in the morning
about 9:00.

55:54.200 --> 55:56.168
It's when the orchids
are in full bloom.

56:02.440 --> 56:04.124
You know he's dying.

56:07.560 --> 56:08.891
Lung cancer.

56:10.440 --> 56:13.284
He has to use an inhaler now
to breathe.

56:29.160 --> 56:30.685
Are you human?

56:33.920 --> 56:35.410
It's just that John said

56:35.480 --> 56:38.245
that you're not capable
of fear or remorse.

56:38.400 --> 56:40.528
They've been suppressed.
Is that true?

56:42.240 --> 56:44.163
Yes.
What about love?

56:47.920 --> 56:49.331
I am what I need to be.

56:49.480 --> 56:50.970
What does that mean?

56:51.120 --> 56:52.406
It means that, in this job,

56:52.480 --> 56:54.323
sometimes it's better
not to feel anything.

56:54.480 --> 56:56.209
I'm not talking about the job.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.968
I think you're lying.

57:02.120 --> 57:04.646
I don't believe you can
just turn off fear or love.

57:04.800 --> 57:06.450
I don't believe anyone can.

57:06.600 --> 57:08.648
I mean, you're either a person
or you're something else.

57:08.800 --> 57:10.211
Which is it?

57:10.400 --> 57:12.880
Are you asking me or yourself?

57:16.160 --> 57:19.164
You can't fight who you are,
Katia.

57:19.640 --> 57:21.290
You'll lose.

57:21.640 --> 57:22.971
Is that what happened to you?

57:23.040 --> 57:24.804
You fought what you were
and you lost?

57:29.560 --> 57:31.210
People can change.

57:31.560 --> 57:33.847
Don't put your faith in me.

57:35.400 --> 57:37.209
You'll be disappointed.

57:39.360 --> 57:41.840
I still have a job to do.

57:43.600 --> 57:45.250
Which is?

57:45.920 --> 57:48.446
Right now, I need to sleep.

59:35.640 --> 59:39.486
When I get anxious and I can't
sleep, I take things apart.

59:42.120 --> 59:43.770
I'm sorry.

59:45.120 --> 59:46.849
Don't ever do that again.

59:51.560 --> 59:52.686
Were they Syndicate?

59:52.840 --> 59:54.126
No, freelance.

59:54.280 --> 59:55.441
Friends of yours?

59:57.760 --> 59:59.603
So, the Syndicate doesn't know
we're here?

59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.922
There's an open contract
out on us. What do you think?

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.046
Here.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.242
Try not to take this apart.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.281
She smells funny.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.481
Robert, please!

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.369
How did they find us
so quickly?

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.441
You tell me.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.601
No games.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.330
What makes you think
this is a game?

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.244
The cameras in the terminal
didn't see me.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.530
But the one outside,
near the exit, did.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.809
Getting pretty good at this,
aren't I?

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.564
No, you're sloppy.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.245
I'm gonna have an attack.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.562
Be a good boy.
Here, take your inhaler.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.804
It'll be all right.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.047
Excuse me.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.120
- Where did you get that?
- I traded it.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.123
For what?
Your knife.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.042
Bring Litvenko and the girl
to me.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.682
You shouldn't have come.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.241
You know who I am?

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.085
You are
your mother's daughter.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.327
Why did you leave me?

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.844
I wanted you to have no part
of what I was.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.725
I wanted you to live.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.210
You had no right.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.685
To walk away from you?

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.728
To turn me into this isolated,
afraid thing that I am.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.325
You had no right.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.570
Walk with me, Katia.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.891
I loved your mother very much.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:38.650
She was a light
in a very dark world.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.203
And more than anything else,
she wanted a child.

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.762
But she was unable.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:53.085
So we broke every rule we had,
and we made you.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.766
We knew
that if you were discovered,

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.524
they would take you from us.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.686
So we gave you
the tools to be free.

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.448
This isn't freedom.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.967
No, perhaps not, Katia.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.164
But it is necessary
for your survival.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:22.565
Now, I don't expect you
to understand...

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.326
but I do ask that you find it
in yourself...

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.723
to forgive an old man
his selfishness.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.484
And if I can't?

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.410
You will,
because you are the reflection

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:39.084
of the woman I loved.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:49.810
I'm ready.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.964
Get it over with.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.684
Do it now.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.881
He's not going to kill you.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.840
Father.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.967
Yes, he will. It's inevitable.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.441
Killing is what
he is programmed to do

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.521
and who he is.

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.885
Isn't that right, 47?

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.249
You're wrong.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.166
We determine who we are
by what we do.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.321
You believe...

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.767
you have a choice?

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.922
I believe
that's what makes us human.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.201
Then it seems...

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.328
that you and your brother

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.483
have a lot to teach
this old man.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.931
I guess I gave you a family
after all.

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:53.601
Move!

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.051
Gotcha.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.361
Seal the building.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.241
Go!

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.641
What do they want?

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:49.846
More of me.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.923
Why would anyone want
more of you?

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.926
One and two, stay on him.
Three and four, cut him off.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.401
Cut him off.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.360
They're boxed in.
They've got nowhere to go.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.931
Right or left, Katia?

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.082
Straight ahead.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.446
Trust me.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.560
Holy shit!

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.439
I want this building sealed!

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.849
Perhaps you should consider
shooting him.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.010
Subdermal body armor.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:46.243
What, they actually got that
to work?

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.567
Yep.

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:50.606
Drive the fucking car faster!

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.006
Faster! Faster!

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.446
We're not gonna make it.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.520
Trust me.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.122
I want all units on station.
We take them in the city.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.451
This is never going to end,
is it?

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.761
I'm afraid not.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.160
He will never stop.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.321
Who?

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:44.121
Antoine Le Clerq.
The Syndicate's chairman.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.166
What if we killed this
Le Clerq? Would it end then?

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.768
You can't.
Maybe not, but you can.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:55.610
Nobody ever gets close enough
to Le Clerq to kill him.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.763
He never leaves his protected
office. Nobody ever goes in.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.803
He's surrounded at all times
by security.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:02.961
14.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.162
That's how many Agents
have tried.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.288
All are dead.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.248
Help me! Help me!

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.090
- Get up!
- I can't walk!

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.044
Come on, you can do it!

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.571
Get up.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.529
- Sorry.
- I can help.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.681
Take her away from me!

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.040
You've got to! Come on!

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.122
Take her! Please!

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.725
Come on!

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.607
Please! Get her out of here!

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.131
No! No!

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.406
Take her!

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.451
Hello, Doctor.

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:50.801
What the fuck did you just do?
We need to go back!

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.121
He was all I had.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:54.281
I have to help him.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.487
You can't.

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.251
God, you emotionless
piece of shit!

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.970
I should kill you.
Yes, you should.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.122
But you won't,
because you're weak.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.408
You're nothing more
than a scared little girl

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.687
whose only real gift...
is running.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.649
Fuck you.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.851
DNA sequences, Doctor?

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.447
Adaptive mutation
bacteriophages.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.521
Epistasis rates, transfer RNA?

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.841
Come on, Doc.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.047
<i>I don't want to do this.</i>

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:00.489
<i>Believe me, you don't want me
to do this either.</i>

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.563
<i>So tell me
what I need to know.</i>

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:04.767
<i>Tell me...</i>

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.970
how to make an Agent.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.326
This shit's experimental, Doc.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.331
I've seen it work...

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.811
and believe me when I tell you

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.043
you don't wanna be the one
it's working on.

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.405
You're a bastard.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.247
I know.

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.727
No. You don't.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.443
You're a result
of inferior technologies.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.849
A failed experiment.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.728
An Agent's advantage
is not his body, John Smith.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.530
It's his mind.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:49.244
You will never be
as good as him.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.526
Cook him.

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.281
For fuck's sake, Doctor,
give me what I need.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.241
Shit.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.641
Mr. Chairman.

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.131
Are you all right?

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.970
No, I'm not.

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.646
I need the Chairman's detail.
The Chairman is out.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.600
<i>995.</i>

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.007
Emergency Services, please.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.282
<i>Can I have your location,
please?</i>

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.286
Dose him again.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.601
It could kill him.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.166
Do it.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.289
Oh, fuck it!

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.040
That's quite enough,
John.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.811
You can wait outside.
All of you.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.164
It's okay, John.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.764
Petya.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.204
Can you hear me?

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.881
I'm going to be completely
honest with you.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.528
I admire you.

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:21.082
You've created something unique.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:25.250
A better human being,
and I want it.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:34.090
I've bet my wealth,
my company, my reputation...

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.409
everything, on the success
of this program,

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.681
you understand.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:45.046
Good thing I sold your stock,
then.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.645
You and I aren't so
very different. You know this.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.201
Oh, you're wrong.

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.080
People can change.

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:57.921
No.

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.449
Not people like us.

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.405
What you did...

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.245
when you chose to play God
can never be undone.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:12.164
You can't run
from what you are.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.765
So, I should...

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.442
embrace it?

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.161
Restart the program
with you at its head?

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.010
Yes.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.250
You always were
a small man, Antoine.

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:38.323
A derivative thinker, at best.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:43.922
This desperation,
it suits you.

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:58.486
The key to everything...

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.164
is in your mind, and you're
going to give it to me.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.731
Tell me how to build an Agent.

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.807
You don't want an Agent.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.720
Then what do I want?

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.803
An army.

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.171
And I won't give it to you.

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.522
Then you're going to die.

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.331
I'm already dead.

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:33.208
Yes, but what about
your daughter?

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.883
You don't have her.

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.527
Oh, but I will. Eventually.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.402
Give me what I want,
and I'll leave her in peace.

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:50.001
I give you what you want,
there will be no peace.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.640
<i>Mr. Chairman.</i>

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.521
Where is he?

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.250
How did he get
into our system?

01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.481
<i>I don't know,
Mr. Chairman.</i>

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:03.042
I'm assuming by your reaction
that you know who I am.

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.725
What do you want?

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.201
<i>To make a deal.</i>

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.321
You have
nothing I need.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:08.890
<i>You're wrong.</i>

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.725
You want what's inside
Litvenko's head...

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.042
<i>but he won't give it to you.</i>

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:15.887
<i>I can.</i>

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:17.605
How?

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.884
<i>Window.</i>

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.244
<i>You want the next generation
of Agents.</i> ..

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.964
<i>But you've been looking
in the wrong place.</i>

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:35.045
<i>You thought the girl was
merely a way to find Litvenko.</i>

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.725
<i>A means to an end.</i>

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.409
Truth is...

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.089
<i>she is the end.</i>

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.605
<i>That's right.</i>

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.091
<i>Everything you need...</i>

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.611
<i>the strength...</i>

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.480
<i>the speed, the intelligence,
is right there.</i>

01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:59.570
<i>...locked inside her DNA.</i>

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:04.566
So you want to trade him
for her? Why?

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.844
Because I always close
my contracts.

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.121
Fuck you.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.802
There's a helipad on the roof.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.561
Get him someplace secure.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.400
Heading back to the safe room.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.846
I want all teams to floor 40.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.640
<i>It's not gonna
be enough, John.</i>

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.127
No. You stay with me,
you protect me!

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:46.046
<i>So many choices.
And only one right answer.</i>

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.610
What's it gonna be?

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:50.489
<i>Emotion or duty?</i>

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.200
It was too quick.
Fire was here too quick.

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:36.646
Someone called them
before the crash.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.847
What does that mean?

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.888
It means he was never
on that helicopter.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.321
Get them out.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.004
What was your mistake?

01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.889
I don't make mistakes.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.610
You needed me to know

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:04.966
you were better than me.

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:27.401
Where is he?

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.246
On the roof.

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.361
When this is done,
I will kill you.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.281
Ahhh!

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:09.240
Your mother would be proud.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:10.721
What?

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.451
Nothing.

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:17.291
I doubt you'd understand.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:18.931
It doesn't matter.

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:20.525
We'll find her.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:23.291
I believe you will.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.841
<i>Confirm target termination.</i>

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.800
Target: Le Clerq, Antoine...

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.725
terminated.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.770
And the other?

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.810
<i>Second target?</i>

01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:30.803
<i>47?</i>

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:40.043
Le Clerq.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.362
He was your target
the whole time?

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:45.011
Everything you taught me

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:47.287
was just so
you could have a diversion.

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:48.920
It was necessary.

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.128
What, to kill a single man?

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:52.765
No.

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:56.606
To put a stop to the Agent
Program once and for all.

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:00.364
And to set you free.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.801
Your father loved you, Katia.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.886
He understood
that Le Clerq would not rest

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.962
once he knew who you were.

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:13.641
That he would hunt you down.

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:17.011
So he did
what any parent would.

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:20.247
He died to save his children.

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.249
This is your mission,
isn't it?

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:39.648
We determine who we are
by what we do.

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:50.206
There is a building full of
highly trained operatives...

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.840
who will be
on their way up here, now.

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:56.126
You're wrong.
There's just one.

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:15.248
Diana says hello.
