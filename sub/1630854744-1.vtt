WEBVTT

00:31.156 --> 00:31.990
Emily.

00:32.658 --> 00:33.492
Oh, shit!

00:41.542 --> 00:47.130
Is there any circumstance more terrifying
than when a child goes missing?

00:48.423 --> 00:52.594
By now, we all know the haunting stories
of Natalee Holloway...

00:52.594 --> 00:56.265
...the 18-year-old who vanished during
a trip to Aruba,

00:56.265 --> 00:57.891
and Gabby Petito,

00:58.559 --> 01:02.688
the young blogger whose remains
were eventually discovered in a park.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.942
The nation watched
around-the-clock coverage...

01:06.942 --> 01:07.860
OPD!

01:07.860 --> 01:10.195
...as every parent feared the worst.

01:10.779 --> 01:13.490
The same story is unfolding again.

01:13.490 --> 01:14.616
Emily Mills!

01:15.826 --> 01:22.165
Recently, a 16-year-old local teen
named Emily Mills disappeared.

01:22.833 --> 01:23.834
Sun.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.379
Hey. Hey.

01:30.632 --> 01:31.633
Okay.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.514
It's not her.

01:38.390 --> 01:43.145
But what if I told you another
local teen went missing a year ago?

01:43.729 --> 01:45.606
Her name is Drea Spivey.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.067
Drea's mother, Charise,
is a friend of mine.

01:49.568 --> 01:54.448
You haven't heard of Drea
because her story has never been covered

01:54.448 --> 01:57.326
by a single news outlet.

01:57.326 --> 02:00.078
Charise was finally able to find Drea

02:00.078 --> 02:02.623
by enlisting the help of friends
in the community.

02:03.415 --> 02:07.544
I interviewed this young girl
to better understand her story.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.465
But there's been an upsetting development.

02:12.382 --> 02:17.763
Sixteen-year-old Drea went missing again
almost 72 hours ago.

02:19.181 --> 02:23.227
With every hour that passes,
the hope to find Drea dims.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.020
This means...

02:26.313 --> 02:30.734
Charise is forced
to live that nightmare all over again.

02:37.199 --> 02:40.077
Just uploaded the podcast
to our new bosses at Boisterous.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.875
I never wanted to see Drea up here.

02:49.419 --> 02:53.924
Another in a sea of sweet, stolen faces.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.342
Drea makes 11 total.

02:55.342 --> 02:58.136
All reported missing
over the last four years in Oakland.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.431
But only one had come home to safety.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.643
Why run again?

03:05.602 --> 03:07.813
Okay. What's our next step?

03:09.189 --> 03:14.319
We conducted over 10 hours of interviews
with Drea before she went missing again.

03:16.613 --> 03:20.492
There must be something
in those recordings that could guide us.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.504
Drea, when the Capstones found you,

03:32.504 --> 03:35.757
you were in a drug den
and addicted to fentanyl.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.552
How did you end up there?

03:39.261 --> 03:41.096
This boy I met gave it to me.

03:41.096 --> 03:45.934
And the first time I snorted fentanyl,
I went somewhere else in my head.

03:46.602 --> 03:49.188
A door opened, I stepped through it,

03:49.188 --> 03:51.732
and everything
on the other side was different.

03:53.108 --> 03:57.070
I just sort of floated along,
and there was no more hurt.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.491
I kept doing it 'cause I wanted
to go wherever I wanted.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.077
Where would you go?

04:06.079 --> 04:07.331
Japanese Gardens.

04:08.332 --> 04:11.001
It's so green. I love it there.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.253
Why?

04:13.962 --> 04:16.673
I had my 11th birthday party there.

04:17.173 --> 04:20.928
That was probably the last time
I remember being legit happy.

04:21.970 --> 04:27.267
That was before my mom had problems
and I had to go into foster care.

04:29.144 --> 04:33.190
After a few years of foster homes,
I just started doing drugs.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.944
You've been sober now for six weeks.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.238
Do you get tempted?

04:40.197 --> 04:41.240
Oh, my God.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.660
Just the other day,
I ran into a friend from my trapping days.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.120
She told me she had
the High Hunter hookup.

04:48.330 --> 04:52.334
It would've been so easy to meet her.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.547
But I didn't.
-What is that? "High Hunter?"

04:57.130 --> 04:59.383
It's a-- It's just a new drug.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.594
But I thought about my life now,

05:03.762 --> 05:06.640
like all the little things
being one big reason to say no.

05:07.558 --> 05:08.934
So, I turned her down.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.397
I know that probably sounds hella corny.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.778
I think that sounds very brave.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.073
Good morning, Oakland.

05:23.073 --> 05:27.536
Three full days have passed since
Bay Area teen Emily Mills was last seen.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.080
Local police departments assured
Channel 13

05:30.080 --> 05:32.916
that bringing Emily home
is their top priority.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.419
The PTA meeting will begin shortly.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.422
Do you need me to get you something, baby?

05:38.422 --> 05:39.506
No. I'm good.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.883
You sure?
-Yeah.

05:40.883 --> 05:43.510
But you might need to step
in here if she doesn't get here soon.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.470
There might be a riot.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.514
How long is she gonna keep us waiting?

05:47.514 --> 05:50.893
She will be here any second.
Everyone, just settle down, please.

05:53.604 --> 05:57.441
I'm sorry. I was on the phone
with the superintendent,

05:57.441 --> 06:00.277
discussing protocol for
tomorrow night's Get Out The Vote event.

06:00.944 --> 06:04.239
Now, with all the cameras and people
on campus tomorrow,

06:04.239 --> 06:07.826
I wanted to have a conversation
about school safety.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.122
Two girls have gone missing
in the last few days,

06:13.457 --> 06:16.668
Emily Mills and Drea Spivey.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.588
Some of you may know
that Drea is a student--

06:20.714 --> 06:25.010
I hate to be indelicate,
but is this really a school safety issue?

06:26.595 --> 06:28.138
What are you saying, Mrs. Williams?

06:30.349 --> 06:31.934
Drea was a drug addict.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.564
What's Ashley's cell phone number?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.525
What does my daughter
have to do with this?

06:39.525 --> 06:43.195
You know what? It's okay.
I'll just message her.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.657
All I'm asking is what this has to do
with our kids.

06:46.657 --> 06:51.078
Our kids know not to do drugs
or whatever Drea was into.

06:54.289 --> 06:59.378
Done. I just messaged Ashley,
who should be in choir right about now.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.256
I pretended to be a boy from Bellarmine.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.216
I told her she was cute

07:04.716 --> 07:08.262
and to meet me in the gym if she wanted
to come to a hooky party.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.763
You can't do that.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.933
That's catfishing or something.

07:14.935 --> 07:19.064
We're using the gym right now, Ashley.
You can go back to choir. Thanks.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.444
In less than 45 seconds,

07:25.153 --> 07:28.991
I got your daughter,
who knows better than Drea,

07:30.576 --> 07:32.494
to meet a stranger in the gym.

07:34.746 --> 07:38.792
What happened to Drea could happen
to any one of your kids.

07:40.878 --> 07:42.212
Do you understand that?

07:44.673 --> 07:48.135
Lastly, I need volunteers
for tomorrow's event.

07:53.891 --> 07:54.892
Thank you.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.105
My parents are just inside.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.649
Don't worry.
That meeting will go on for hours.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.819
Yeah.
But if my dad catches us, he'll kill me.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.030
Or he'll just kill you--

08:08.864 --> 08:10.449
He'd make me watch.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.120
So, you really want me to stop?

08:16.121 --> 08:17.915
No, I wouldn't say that.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.
-I just--

08:21.418 --> 08:23.378
I just wish we had some privacy.

08:25.756 --> 08:28.759
When can we go back to my cousins' house?
It's been a minute.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.136
Soon.

08:35.307 --> 08:36.308
Mrs. Killebrew.

08:36.892 --> 08:40.270
I was just keeping Trini
company during your meeting.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.438
Well, I'm here now.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.149
So, she doesn't need to be kept company
any longer, does she?

08:44.149 --> 08:45.234
Yes, ma'am.

08:46.818 --> 08:47.903
I'll text you.
-Yeah.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.200
You think I scared him?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.284
What?

08:54.284 --> 08:57.079
Your father always gets
to be the tough one. It's not fair.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.249
Wait, am I in trouble? Or...

09:00.249 --> 09:04.211
Sweetheart, if I told you all the places
that your grandmother caught me

09:04.211 --> 09:07.673
and my high school boyfriend hooking up,
you wouldn't look at me the same again.

09:07.673 --> 09:08.966
Mom.

09:08.966 --> 09:14.638
Trini, you're never in trouble
as long as you are honest with me, okay?

09:16.431 --> 09:18.183
All I care about is keeping you safe,

09:18.183 --> 09:20.853
especially with all
of this going on with Drea.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.438
And that is why you cannot be getting...

09:23.438 --> 09:24.940
Mom, I know.
-...into a stranger's car...

09:24.940 --> 09:27.651
I told you it was Aubrey's cousin.
-...and not answering your phone.

09:27.651 --> 09:29.152
You had us worried sick, honey.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.364
Yeah, I know.

09:32.364 --> 09:36.076
I'm sorry. I learned my lesson. Really.

09:37.619 --> 09:38.954
Well, then you have my trust.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.418
There's no way you're getting in.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.962
This is ludicrous. I know Detective Aames.

09:46.962 --> 09:48.422
Like you know Markus Killebrew?

09:49.006 --> 09:53.010
Yeah, how's he enjoying sleeping on piles
of our department's hard-earned cash?

09:55.846 --> 09:58.390
Finally. Aames, could you please
tell them to let me through?

09:58.390 --> 10:01.268
I thought I told you
you're not welcome here, Miss Parnell.

10:02.895 --> 10:04.354
It's Scoville.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.981
Take care of this, new guy.

10:05.981 --> 10:07.065
Time to go.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.621
Did we sell it?
-I think a little too well.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.873
Listen, I am sorry.

10:22.873 --> 10:25.709
I don't have any more news
on Drea Spivey. I am trying.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.504
No, they got you working Emily Mills
24 hours a day.

10:28.504 --> 10:29.588
You are not wrong.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.466
Well, if you can find an extra hour
in your day,

10:33.425 --> 10:35.636
something came up
in one of Drea's interviews.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.388
She made a reference to "High Hunter."

10:38.388 --> 10:39.848
Said it was a new drug.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.851
High Hunter? It's not one I've heard of.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.978
Well, if it isn't a drug,
what else could it be?

10:44.978 --> 10:47.272
It could be a dealer.
It could be a trap house.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.649
I'll look into it for you.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.486
Wait, is that--

10:52.986 --> 10:53.987
Andrew Finney.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.072
Andrew.
-Danny.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.908
Front-runner to be Oakland's next mayor.

10:57.908 --> 11:01.828
You wanna know why we're so pressed
to find Emily Mills? There's your answer.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.208
But he's not even in office yet.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.418
You beat that law-and-order
drum hard enough

11:08.418 --> 11:12.381
in the age of "defund police,"
you get a hero's welcome 'round here.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.217
Law and order for whom?

11:24.101 --> 11:25.102
Thank you.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.231
This guy's blowing up my phone.

11:29.982 --> 11:31.066
You like him?

11:31.066 --> 11:32.693
We had one date. We'll see.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.780
You should get back out there.

11:36.780 --> 11:37.948
That part.

11:37.948 --> 11:41.994
Tinder, BlackPeopleMeet,
Bumble, Hinge, JDate.

11:41.994 --> 11:44.454
JDate.
Get you a nice Jewish boy.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.998
All of it.

11:45.998 --> 11:47.249
I'm not using an app.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.628
Plus, I think I'm fine alone. For now.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.339
That's new.

11:54.965 --> 11:57.301
I mean, the old Poppy just had
to have herself some Ingram.

11:57.301 --> 11:59.928
Right? This new you is doing baller shit.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.639
Mrs. Rhoades would've never come up
with a stunt like this.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.142
What are you talking about?
I've always been this person.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.437
I have.

12:09.605 --> 12:12.816
Remember when Uncle Bug
brought me over to Aunt Leona's

12:12.816 --> 12:16.153
and I had us crash that
little bougie tea party she used to hold

12:16.153 --> 12:18.405
in the backyard?
-I forgot all about that.

12:18.405 --> 12:22.534
It was sponsored by the Links, and we
weren't allowed to come and get any cake.

12:22.534 --> 12:26.079
We sure did make a ruckus when we came
in there banging them pots and pans.

12:26.079 --> 12:29.458
We made an impact. Aunt Leona was pissed.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.920
Why is she insisting that we go back
to that house to pick up Mom's stuff?

12:32.920 --> 12:35.923
I just hate the idea of going back
to that place. Too many bad memories.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.509
Yeah, it has a lot of bad memories
for me too.

12:39.218 --> 12:44.223
Not because I lived there,
but 'cause Aunt Leona shut me out.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.392
Let's just get it over with then,
so we all can move on.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.145
That heifer's moving to Vineyard,

12:50.145 --> 12:52.189
so it's good riddance.
-Well...

12:52.189 --> 12:54.608
All the way around.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.944
Cheers on that. Goodbye.
-Yes.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.619
Hey.

13:07.871 --> 13:08.956
What do you think?

13:12.209 --> 13:13.210
It's perfect.

13:20.509 --> 13:24.638
I can't stay long. I'm meeting with some
of the other MCs, let 'em know about Drea.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.516
Have you ever heard of High Hunter?

13:28.225 --> 13:29.226
No, what's that?

13:29.810 --> 13:31.520
It's a drug Drea mentioned.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.732
I'm just trying to figure out what it is
and where she used to get it.

13:37.276 --> 13:38.777
I'll keep my ears to the ground.

13:39.278 --> 13:41.280
Aames didn't know anything.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.365
He knows OPD ain't doing enough.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.784
This is something we can handle ourselves.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.119
Daddy--
-I mean it!

13:58.714 --> 13:59.715
Daddy...

14:01.550 --> 14:04.136
are you sure it's okay for me
to stay in this house?

14:04.136 --> 14:05.053
I--

14:05.846 --> 14:09.183
I said my name is Poppy Scoville
on my podcast. I--

14:10.767 --> 14:13.187
You don't need my approval to stay.
-I know.

14:16.690 --> 14:17.691
I'm just...

14:19.651 --> 14:23.113
trying to figure out
what my declaration really means.

14:25.741 --> 14:28.493
Is that why you wanna do the podcast
on Drea and the missing girls?

14:28.493 --> 14:29.912
So you can prove yourself.

14:31.413 --> 14:32.414
Maybe.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.584
Maybe to redeem myself too.

14:37.836 --> 14:42.508
I think of those girls, I think how easily
I could have been one of 'em.

14:42.508 --> 14:43.800
Yeah, but you're here.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.345
You're Poppy Scoville.

14:47.596 --> 14:50.140
And being a Scoville has nothing to do
with geography.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.975
It's about how you carry yourself.

14:56.605 --> 14:57.606
Keep your head up.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.192
We got work to do.

15:07.574 --> 15:11.453
I'm outside the Piedmont home
of missing teen Emily Mills.

15:11.453 --> 15:15.624
Following Emily's story
is mayoral candidate Andrew Finney.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.209
It's a horrible situation.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.753
Every parent's worst nightmare.

15:20.337 --> 15:23.131
The crime in this city
has gotten out of control.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.644
Good afternoon,
community members, stakeholders and press.

15:36.228 --> 15:38.689
I'm Lee Hackman,
and this is my wife Sybil.

15:41.149 --> 15:45.654
We started our company, Questeur,
out of a garage

15:45.654 --> 15:47.948
when we were across the bay, at Stanford.

15:48.824 --> 15:53.120
And today, Questeur is one of
the largest tech companies in the world.

15:53.120 --> 15:57.207
And we're about to break ground on our
new Questeur campus right here in Oakland.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.376
That better mean jobs for the community.

16:01.879 --> 16:02.880
You bet.

16:04.715 --> 16:08.218
We owe a huge thank you
to Oak Creek High School

16:08.218 --> 16:09.720
for lending us their campus.

16:10.429 --> 16:11.805
Over the past seven years,

16:11.805 --> 16:15.934
this school has become one
of the top performing schools in Oakland.

16:16.894 --> 16:20.731
In other words, we know where to keep
an eye out for future Questeur employees.

16:21.899 --> 16:24.610
Superintendent Lennon, please stand up,

16:24.610 --> 16:27.571
so that we can acknowledge you
and all that you've done here.

16:28.864 --> 16:29.865
All that he's done?

16:30.449 --> 16:32.951
Just smile. I'll key his car later.

16:32.951 --> 16:36.079
Most of you already have
the Questeur messaging app.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.832
But we've recently added a new feature

16:38.832 --> 16:42.085
that enables anyone
to easily register to vote.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.420
And for today only,

16:43.420 --> 16:47.591
you can use the app to submit questions
directly to the candidates,

16:47.591 --> 16:48.884
which I recommend you do.

16:48.884 --> 16:51.970
Oakland is in a period of transition.

16:51.970 --> 16:56.517
So now, more than ever, it's critical
that we vote as informed citizens.

16:56.517 --> 16:58.227
So without further ado,

16:58.227 --> 17:03.065
please welcome Rachel McKegney,
Everett Hoagland and Andrew Finney.

17:06.527 --> 17:10.571
They are our future,
and we need to invest in them accordingly.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.200
While in office, I championed Measure W.

17:13.992 --> 17:17.829
By utilizing funds allocated
in this anti-gang initiative,

17:17.829 --> 17:20.874
police can focus
on specific areas of the city.

17:20.874 --> 17:25.587
And if elected, I intend to reduce
the budget for local law enforcement.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.089
So I urge you to vote for me.

17:29.341 --> 17:30.342
There's abs--

17:33.595 --> 17:36.849
There's absolutely no reason why
a progressive candidate can't

17:36.849 --> 17:38.934
also support a strong police department.

17:38.934 --> 17:41.270
Please pardon the interruption.

17:42.437 --> 17:48.777
The faces you see before you
are all missing girls from Oakland,

17:49.361 --> 17:51.363
with families who want them home.

17:52.114 --> 17:55.242
This is Drea Spivey,

17:56.201 --> 17:58.328
a student at this very school,

17:58.328 --> 18:00.914
who went missing almost four days ago,

18:00.914 --> 18:04.793
but the search party
for her had very little police support.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.379
We came to ask why.

18:08.547 --> 18:09.548
Why?

18:10.799 --> 18:12.676
Does this girl not deserve attention?

18:13.802 --> 18:18.307
Is it not imperative
to allocate resources to help find her?

18:20.184 --> 18:26.231
If you feel as we do, we need you
to put pressure on the police department

18:26.231 --> 18:29.526
and the news media
to bring these girls home.

18:29.526 --> 18:33.906
Bring our girls home!
-Yes, bring 'em back.

18:33.906 --> 18:35.699
Bring all of them home.

18:35.699 --> 18:36.783
Yes.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.661
Bring our girls home!
They need to be with us!

18:39.661 --> 18:43.999
I've heard a lot of people talking
about Emily Mills.

18:45.792 --> 18:49.880
I hope they find her safe,
so she can be returned to her family.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.594
But my daughter is missing too.

18:57.679 --> 18:59.848
My Drea matters too.

19:00.557 --> 19:04.811
She's my only child,
and I need you to help me find her.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.730
Bring her home.
-Bring 'em home.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.899
Do something!
-Your daughter does matter.

19:10.901 --> 19:14.154
And I hope she's home with you soon.
Your questions are good ones.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.324
But there is a time and a place
for all our words.

19:18.742 --> 19:20.661
Say her name!
-Say her name!

19:21.954 --> 19:24.456
Say her name!
-Say her name!

19:24.456 --> 19:29.294
Say her name! Say her name! Say her name!

19:29.294 --> 19:38.846
Say her name! Say her name!

19:38.846 --> 19:40.639
Say her name!

19:49.606 --> 19:51.149
That was some stunt.

19:53.569 --> 19:57.281
I know you were aggrieved
that this was foisted upon you,

19:57.281 --> 19:59.700
but to embarrass your school,
your students

19:59.700 --> 20:03.412
and your boss this way
makes me question your judgment entirely.

20:04.705 --> 20:07.040
If you continue
to act like one of the school's children,

20:07.040 --> 20:09.168
I will have no choice
but to treat you like one.

20:11.545 --> 20:12.713
I'll do better.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.849
I hope I didn't get you into trouble.

20:23.849 --> 20:25.225
Only the good kind.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.769
Eva Pierre.
-Poppy Scoville.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.230
Markus Killebrew told me all about you.

20:31.315 --> 20:33.442
You think that demonstration is
gonna make a difference?

20:33.442 --> 20:34.818
I don't know.

20:34.818 --> 20:39.907
Right now, I'd just settle for action.
Police, political, tweets, whatever.

20:40.532 --> 20:42.201
It's what all these girls deserve.

20:42.201 --> 20:43.285
Yeah.

20:44.203 --> 20:45.412
We can hope.

20:45.913 --> 20:46.914
Miss Pierre?

20:47.706 --> 20:51.001
Poppy, this is Tanya,
one of Drea's friends.

20:51.877 --> 20:53.837
Nice to meet you, Tanya.
-You too.

20:53.837 --> 20:57.466
I saw what you did in there. I wanna help.
I ju-- I'm just not sure how.

20:58.091 --> 21:01.803
Well, have you ever heard
Drea mention someone

21:01.803 --> 21:03.472
with the nickname "High Hunter"?

21:04.598 --> 21:06.433
Could that be her drug dealer maybe?

21:07.809 --> 21:10.229
I don't know anything about him.
I don't use.

21:10.938 --> 21:13.065
I should go.
I have a lot of homework to do.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.483
I think it can wait.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.152
I don't think you're being honest
with me, Tanya.

21:18.070 --> 21:19.404
That's very disappointing.

21:22.241 --> 21:25.118
She hasn't texted me in a week.
I'm scared.

21:25.786 --> 21:28.497
Give me your fear. Let us act on it.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.837
I never heard her call him High Hunter,

21:34.837 --> 21:38.090
but Drea did have
this guy she was hanging around with.

21:38.090 --> 21:39.424
Do you know his name?

21:40.551 --> 21:42.135
All I know is that he was older,

21:42.135 --> 21:44.388
and that Drea said
that he took care of her.

21:45.222 --> 21:47.099
But you didn't like the sound of him?

21:48.141 --> 21:49.142
She seemed scared.

21:50.644 --> 21:52.855
Everything she described sounded
real controlling.

21:53.897 --> 21:55.774
The last few weeks, she kept telling me

21:55.774 --> 21:57.776
that she needed some time
in her happy place.

21:59.278 --> 22:01.238
That's all I know. I swear.

22:01.238 --> 22:03.323
It's okay. You can go, Tanya. Thank you.

22:03.824 --> 22:04.825
Thanks.

22:07.077 --> 22:11.540
I hate to be the one to bring this up,
but have you considered that--

22:11.540 --> 22:13.750
This controlling guy is Drea's pimp?

22:15.961 --> 22:17.713
I'm trying not to go there.

22:18.297 --> 22:19.298
But...

22:22.509 --> 22:25.470
I think I know
where Drea's happy place is.

22:28.932 --> 22:30.726
You look good doing the dishes.

22:30.726 --> 22:32.477
I look good doing a lot of things.

22:33.687 --> 22:34.897
Hey, baby?
-Uh-huh.

22:34.897 --> 22:36.899
Let me ask you a question.

22:36.899 --> 22:39.902
You think that Trini and Aubrey are--

22:41.278 --> 22:43.363
Jesus Christ, I can't even say it.

22:45.032 --> 22:46.617
No. Trini told me she's a virgin.

22:47.409 --> 22:48.911
So you two talked about it?

22:49.536 --> 22:52.164
Don't look so shocked.
We talk about a lot of things.

22:53.665 --> 22:55.501
How come you never told me about it?

22:55.501 --> 22:57.419
You never asked before.

22:57.419 --> 23:00.923
And seeing as how you--
You can't even say it,

23:01.548 --> 23:04.635
I was right in assuming it's a don't ask,
don't tell policy.

23:05.469 --> 23:06.553
Damn.

23:06.553 --> 23:09.723
So I guess we have to invite
that knucklehead over for dinner, huh?

23:10.599 --> 23:13.852
Look, I just want to sit the boy down,
look him right in his eyes.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.270
See what he's all about.

23:15.270 --> 23:16.355
Okay.

23:16.897 --> 23:20.692
You wanna broach that subject
with Trini, by all means, go ahead.

23:20.692 --> 23:21.777
I will.

23:22.402 --> 23:25.656
And I won't even be nice about it either.
-Okay, big man.

23:25.656 --> 23:26.782
Excuse me.

23:26.782 --> 23:28.534
I gotta go to work.
-Uh-huh.

23:29.201 --> 23:30.744
Love you.
-I love you, baby.

23:30.744 --> 23:32.246
Bring me back something sweet?

23:32.246 --> 23:33.330
Yes, I will.

23:34.289 --> 23:35.582
It'll be me.

23:39.962 --> 23:40.963
That's--

23:41.922 --> 23:42.923
Hi, sir.

23:44.007 --> 23:46.718
Where are you racing off to,
urgent meeting of the assholes?

23:47.719 --> 23:48.720
What?

23:51.849 --> 23:53.058
Just wondering,

23:54.184 --> 23:58.063
how someone
with your temperament became a principal.

23:59.523 --> 24:01.483
I don't need them to like me.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.026
They need me to protect them.

24:03.861 --> 24:06.655
That's what my high school principal did
for me.

24:10.534 --> 24:12.452
My mom was illegal.

24:14.288 --> 24:16.832
She brought me here from Haiti
for a shot at a better education,

24:16.832 --> 24:21.295
but was deported
while I was still in high school.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.673
I didn't have anybody looking out for me.

24:25.299 --> 24:27.801
My high school principal, Evelyn Varga,

24:27.801 --> 24:30.179
she made sure
that school was a safe place, you know?

24:30.179 --> 24:32.514
Like a refuge for me.

24:33.807 --> 24:35.559
She made sure I graduated on time,

24:35.559 --> 24:38.645
and I was the first one in my family
to go to college.

24:40.814 --> 24:41.815
Here I am.

24:43.192 --> 24:44.902
Your mother must be so proud.

24:45.694 --> 24:48.071
You honor her sacrifice every day.

24:50.282 --> 24:53.202
She passed away
shortly after being deported.

24:54.870 --> 24:56.079
I was barely 20.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.584
I lost my mother too young as well.

25:01.084 --> 25:02.461
Isn't it always too young?

25:14.056 --> 25:16.475
Hi, we're looking for a missing girl.
-Thank you.

25:16.475 --> 25:17.559
Take a look.

25:25.859 --> 25:28.487
Excuse me, have you seen that girl?

25:31.448 --> 25:32.449
Nah.

25:58.976 --> 26:02.229
You'll have to stop blaming yourself
for Drea going missing again.

26:03.021 --> 26:04.982
It's not on you or the Capstones.

26:06.817 --> 26:09.069
I've been thinking
about a lot of things, Lil.

26:10.279 --> 26:11.780
My legacy--
-Is secure.

26:11.780 --> 26:12.948
Is it?

26:13.824 --> 26:15.284
What are you talking about?

26:22.249 --> 26:25.586
OPD put out a list
of calls they gonna stop responding to.

26:26.086 --> 26:30.132
Basically, 10 commandments that all say,
"Fuck you, deal with it yourself."

26:30.132 --> 26:33.010
So, I been thinking I will.

26:34.052 --> 26:35.929
You got nothing to prove to anyone.

26:37.222 --> 26:39.349
Said the same thing to Poppy.

26:40.267 --> 26:43.896
I'm happy y'all two have gotten
so much closer the last couple of months.

26:44.479 --> 26:45.898
I can see it's good for you.

26:46.815 --> 26:47.858
She's still lost.

26:48.525 --> 26:50.194
And my grandma used to say,

26:50.194 --> 26:53.113
"There always gonna be some people
who are just a little bit restless."

26:53.614 --> 26:55.616
Georgia grandmas know everything.
-Yeah.

26:58.035 --> 27:01.705
You got a call today from Andrew Finney.

27:03.415 --> 27:04.833
The cat running for mayor?

27:06.210 --> 27:07.794
Said he wants to meet with you.

27:08.462 --> 27:12.049
Could be he saw the influence
that you have and wants to work with you.

27:14.009 --> 27:15.177
With our history?

27:16.303 --> 27:18.013
Capstones don't do politics.

27:18.514 --> 27:20.224
Well, maybe they should.

27:27.397 --> 27:30.234
Why did you fall in love with me?

27:32.653 --> 27:36.406
Because there's no one else
in the world like you.

27:37.658 --> 27:41.119
Nothing you do will make you more
of a man than you already are.

27:42.204 --> 27:46.166
You're the most compassionate,
authentic soul I've ever met.

27:47.084 --> 27:51.129
And I've loved you from the inside out.

27:51.713 --> 27:52.714
Always.

27:54.216 --> 27:55.509
Inside out, huh?

28:16.572 --> 28:20.033
Have you seen the latest dispatch
from our new overlords at Boisterous?

28:20.951 --> 28:22.703
Do they have a problem with our VO sample?

28:22.703 --> 28:27.541
No, but they'd just love us to lean
into the "tragic nature of Drea's life."

28:28.709 --> 28:29.710
Look, Noa...

28:31.253 --> 28:33.005
I think Drea is being trafficked.

28:37.593 --> 28:39.553
They're gonna hang Drea
and Charise out to dry.

28:39.553 --> 28:43.849
I will control it, okay?
I know how to handle Boisterous.

28:43.849 --> 28:48.312
It may mean a lot of haggling with
corporate, but I can handle Boisterous.

28:48.312 --> 28:51.523
We are going to have to be able
to do the story we wanna do.

28:51.523 --> 28:53.692
These guys are asking
for sensationalist chum.

28:53.692 --> 28:56.653
And we may not feel it at first,
but it'll be a picture here

28:56.653 --> 28:58.322
and a sound bite there,
and before we know it,

28:58.322 --> 29:00.199
the marketing will start
to drive the narrative.

29:00.199 --> 29:02.367
It's how Micah lost sight
of who she really was.

29:02.367 --> 29:03.327
Okay.

29:03.827 --> 29:04.745
Okay.

29:05.245 --> 29:06.455
I'll call the lawyers.

29:06.455 --> 29:09.208
See if they can amend the contract
to give us marketing approval.

29:09.708 --> 29:10.709
Thank you.

29:13.212 --> 29:14.213
Okay.

29:33.106 --> 29:34.107
Use your legs.

29:35.317 --> 29:36.860
Use your legs.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.615
Okay, okay. Enough.

29:50.332 --> 29:52.292
What happened at the Gardens with Poppy?

29:52.292 --> 29:54.127
I haven't seen you like this in years.

29:54.628 --> 29:55.838
You think she's good people?

29:56.880 --> 29:58.382
You're the one that talked to her.

29:58.382 --> 30:01.552
Yeah, she's not how I expected her to be.

30:03.011 --> 30:04.137
And don't forget cute.

30:05.264 --> 30:06.682
This man's not blind.

30:08.851 --> 30:12.604
So what, you're thinking about working
with her or something?

30:13.647 --> 30:14.773
I can't do this alone.

30:16.608 --> 30:17.609
Just be careful

30:18.861 --> 30:21.196
because that's a fucking live wire
right there.

30:22.489 --> 30:23.490
So am I.

30:24.199 --> 30:25.242
Let's go. Come on. Again.

30:25.242 --> 30:27.077
Let's go, old man.

30:27.077 --> 30:28.537
Shake a leg.
-All right.

30:46.263 --> 30:47.264
Hello?

30:49.183 --> 30:50.225
Hello?

30:51.018 --> 30:53.103
You have to stop looking for me.

30:54.062 --> 30:55.063
Drea?

30:55.063 --> 30:56.398
I'm fine.

30:56.398 --> 30:58.400
So, why don't you come home?

30:58.400 --> 31:01.278
We all miss you and want you safe.

31:02.196 --> 31:03.572
What's going on, honey?

31:03.572 --> 31:04.865
You wouldn't understand.

31:05.782 --> 31:08.744
Well, does it have anything to do
with that guy Tanya mentioned?

31:12.706 --> 31:13.916
I owe him.

31:13.916 --> 31:15.000
How much?

31:15.000 --> 31:19.213
Whatever it is,
we can pay off your debt to High Hunter.

31:19.838 --> 31:20.839
What?

31:22.132 --> 31:23.342
It's not that simple.

31:23.967 --> 31:29.181
Look, he's done so much for me,
so now I have to return the favor.

31:30.140 --> 31:31.141
What does that mean?

31:33.227 --> 31:34.228
I don't know.

31:35.103 --> 31:37.105
Give guys blow jobs and stuff.

31:38.398 --> 31:42.653
Drea, that man is pimping you out.

31:46.949 --> 31:48.116
Drea?

31:48.116 --> 31:49.618
Don't tell my mom.

31:49.618 --> 31:51.537
She loves you so much.

31:51.537 --> 31:53.121
She'd do anything for you.

31:54.122 --> 31:55.916
Can that guy you're with say that?

31:57.459 --> 31:59.503
I got this, okay?

32:00.254 --> 32:01.255
Tell my mom that.

32:01.255 --> 32:07.052
Okay, can you at least call her
and let her know you're alive?

32:08.345 --> 32:09.346
Okay?

32:17.938 --> 32:18.939
Trafficked?

32:23.110 --> 32:24.278
How did this happen?

32:25.654 --> 32:28.156
Could you tell where she was?
Did you hear anything?

32:28.699 --> 32:29.700
No.

32:30.409 --> 32:33.453
But it's not too late for her, Charise.
We can still bring her home.

32:33.954 --> 32:35.747
Look, Poppy's right, okay?

32:36.456 --> 32:38.917
Now, Drea wouldn't even had called her

32:38.917 --> 32:41.044
if some part of her
didn't wanna come home.

32:42.337 --> 32:44.131
My question for you is,

32:45.424 --> 32:47.634
do you want me putting this
on the podcast?

32:48.802 --> 32:51.221
When you agreed
to let me interview her initially,

32:51.221 --> 32:54.474
it was a talk about her time missing
and the drugs.

32:55.142 --> 32:56.977
But this is different.

32:57.561 --> 32:58.770
It's up to you.

33:00.189 --> 33:02.274
I won't air anything you don't want me to.

33:10.741 --> 33:13.702
If you think it has a chance
to bring her home...

33:16.580 --> 33:17.581
do it.

33:33.096 --> 33:35.557
Hey.

33:38.310 --> 33:39.311
So...

33:40.437 --> 33:43.857
Charise approved using Drea's interviews
to talk about trafficking.

33:44.441 --> 33:46.401
What'd the lawyer say
about amending the contract?

33:47.903 --> 33:49.029
Yeah, she said,

33:49.821 --> 33:54.618
"Boisterous is open
to discussion regarding marketing."

33:54.618 --> 33:57.120
Pop, they'll use the most lurid details.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.705
The campaign will be all about sex,

33:58.705 --> 34:01.041
and the girls will be a footnote.
-Not if we find them.

34:01.041 --> 34:04.378
Have you seen the advertising
for their women's prison podcast?

34:04.378 --> 34:07.714
Every female inmate wears
the tightest tank top imaginable.

34:07.714 --> 34:09.842
But that's not gonna happen
with Reconsidered.

34:09.842 --> 34:13.637
Maybe not, but doesn't it bother you
that it's the Boisterous MO?

34:14.304 --> 34:18.266
Sure, but these girls' story is way
too important,

34:18.266 --> 34:21.853
so, I'll give the tank tops an eye roll

34:21.853 --> 34:25.148
and keep it moving if it means
our message gets out to the masses.

34:25.148 --> 34:28.652
We're not even ready to go on air
with a trafficking episode.

34:28.652 --> 34:31.280
This pivot requires more research.
We need more time.

34:31.280 --> 34:32.614
Drea doesn't have time!

34:32.614 --> 34:35.199
We're already compromising.
Can't you see that?

34:35.199 --> 34:37.953
What I see is an opportunity to help.

34:37.953 --> 34:39.746
Look, when I was with Alex,

34:39.746 --> 34:42.373
I saw how
our podcast affected his daughter.

34:43.166 --> 34:45.752
She heard every word other kids said
about her,

34:45.752 --> 34:49.590
and that was without salacious marketing
and sensationalized copy.

34:49.590 --> 34:51.967
If we do things the Boisterous way,

34:53.135 --> 34:56.722
Drea and the other girls will be hurt
much more than Alex's daughter.

34:56.722 --> 34:57.806
What are you saying?

34:57.806 --> 35:00.976
The message doesn't matter if
this is how we're gonna convey it.

35:00.976 --> 35:03.520
I wish you would just trust me!

35:04.021 --> 35:05.647
I wish you would trust me!
I'm telling you,

35:05.647 --> 35:10.694
I am not gonna let Boisterous exploit
Charise, Drea or any of the girls.

35:10.694 --> 35:12.070
I'm not, Noa.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.452
Poppy, I just--

35:21.455 --> 35:24.917
I just don't think that I'm compatible
with Boisterous.

35:27.669 --> 35:30.214
So, this'll be my last podcast.

35:34.426 --> 35:35.677
As a journalist,

35:36.303 --> 35:41.266
when I came across something horrific,
something I wanted to turn away from,

35:42.434 --> 35:45.812
I couldn't. I had to confront it.

35:47.147 --> 35:50.400
So, here it goes.

35:52.444 --> 35:56.990
Drea Spivey is a bright,
beautiful young woman.

35:58.408 --> 36:01.161
She's a junior
at Oak Creek High in Oakland.

36:01.703 --> 36:07.167
Her favorite subject is biology,
and her dream is to become a nurse.

36:08.460 --> 36:12.005
And she is also a victim
of sex trafficking.

36:13.507 --> 36:15.175
When people think of sex trafficking,

36:15.175 --> 36:19.513
their minds go
to scary men kidnapping girls

36:19.513 --> 36:21.265
and taking them across borders.

36:23.350 --> 36:29.356
But sex trafficking is more often
a neighbor, a friend,

36:30.691 --> 36:36.196
even someone on social media
who lures kids into trusting them,

36:36.196 --> 36:39.241
only to turn around and abuse them.

36:40.951 --> 36:43.620
People always assume
this could never happen to them

36:43.620 --> 36:44.705
or their kids.

36:46.540 --> 36:50.002
But the truth is, it is happening.

36:50.711 --> 36:55.674
And not just in some shadowy,
forgotten corner of the hood.

36:57.009 --> 37:01.138
It's happening in our schools,
our community.

37:02.014 --> 37:05.309
Trafficking has been labeled an epidemic
in Oakland.

37:07.019 --> 37:09.813
How much we are to blame
for our negligence

37:10.522 --> 37:13.442
is a conversation for you...

37:15.694 --> 37:16.904
and the god you worship.

37:18.030 --> 37:19.281
What you looking for, mama?

37:19.281 --> 37:20.365
Get in.

37:23.327 --> 37:24.578
I know one thing:

37:26.330 --> 37:29.875
Drea and the other missing girls like her,

37:29.875 --> 37:31.376
wherever they are,

37:32.711 --> 37:34.129
deserve our love.

37:36.131 --> 37:38.550
I don't got track marks.
I don't mess with that shit.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.053
Smart girl.

37:41.053 --> 37:42.304
I aim to find them

37:42.971 --> 37:45.849
and the people responsible
for taking them away.

37:47.017 --> 37:50.145
Sex trafficking is a cancer on our city.

37:51.605 --> 37:53.565
I know I can't cure it.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.568
But I can expose it.

37:57.236 --> 37:59.947
I hope you'll follow me into this world,

38:01.573 --> 38:02.991
however dark it may be.

38:05.911 --> 38:07.704
My name is Poppy Scoville,

38:09.665 --> 38:13.627
and I'd like you to reconsider.

38:28.058 --> 38:30.394
I'll clean this up and send it to ya.

38:30.394 --> 38:34.606
I may lay a little music over the end,
but it'll be ready to air tomorrow.

38:35.148 --> 38:36.400
Sounds good.
-Yeah.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.484
Thank you.
-Sure.

38:42.990 --> 38:46.743
I was gonna give this to you when we got
to 50 million listeners,

38:46.743 --> 38:49.580
but you'll be there soon enough.

38:51.373 --> 38:52.499
Thank you.

38:56.170 --> 38:57.296
It's been an honor.

38:58.338 --> 38:59.339
Me too.
-Yeah.

39:06.263 --> 39:07.598
Nothing new under the sun.

39:08.557 --> 39:10.225
But there are new suns.
-Yeah.

39:25.407 --> 39:26.533
Is that...

39:31.038 --> 39:32.789
"To my favorite Oakland girl.

39:33.540 --> 39:37.461
Now that you have your roots,
may you never lose your voice.

39:38.295 --> 39:40.380
Love, Noa."

39:50.766 --> 39:51.767
Hey, Aames.

39:56.480 --> 39:57.481
Wait, what?

40:31.098 --> 40:32.224
Hold up, guys.

40:55.831 --> 40:56.832
Thank you.

41:29.948 --> 41:31.658
I don't want this to be real.

41:38.999 --> 41:40.584
This motel's on High Street.

41:42.294 --> 41:43.670
Guess what the nickname is.

41:45.506 --> 41:46.965
High Hunter.

41:50.385 --> 41:52.471
Somebody wanted to shut her up, Aames.

41:55.307 --> 41:56.683
I'm gonna find out who.
