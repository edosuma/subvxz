WEBVTT

00:02.585 --> 00:03.920
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:04.003 --> 00:07.090
IN FRONT OF
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:07.173 --> 00:08.925
- SOMEONE'S LOOKING
SEXY TONIGHT.

00:09.008 --> 00:10.301
all: THANKS.

00:10.385 --> 00:13.763
- I WAS TALKING ABOUT ME.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.056
I'M GOING OUT WITH ROY TONIGHT.

00:16.140 --> 00:20.228
- WELL, HERE'S TO US ALL HAVING
HOT DATES ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.

00:20.311 --> 00:21.813
- MM-HMM.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.064
- I HAVE A DATE WITH A MODEL.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.607
HE'S YOUNG, GOOD LOOKING,

00:24.691 --> 00:26.234
AND A MODEL.

00:26.317 --> 00:27.569
- [laughs]
HAVE WE SEEN HIM IN ANYTHING?

00:27.652 --> 00:28.611
- OH, TONS OF STUFF.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.447
THE GREATER CLEVELAND
MUTUAL BANK AD

00:30.530 --> 00:31.573
WHERE THE HANDS SHAKE,

00:31.656 --> 00:33.283
UH, THE INSURANCE AD
WHERE THE HANDS

00:33.366 --> 00:34.951
CRADLE THE BABY CHICK,

00:35.034 --> 00:36.828
AND THAT PLUMBER AD
WHERE THE HAND

00:36.911 --> 00:40.123
PULLS OUT A WAD OF HAIR
FROM THE DRAIN.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.458
- SO, HE'S A HAND MODEL.

00:41.541 --> 00:45.128
- YES...A MODEL.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.629
- WELL I'M GOING OUT
WITH LOU AGAIN.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.673
I ABSOLUTELY ADORE HIM.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.134
- BUT?
- NO BUTS.

00:51.217 --> 00:54.846
- IF HE'S DATING YOU,
THERE'S A BUT.

00:54.929 --> 00:55.972
- FINE.

00:56.055 --> 00:58.641
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW OLD HE IS.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.810
HE'S GOT THE YOUNG FACE,
OLD HAIR THING

01:00.894 --> 01:02.312
AND BECAUSE
HE'S AFRICAN-AMERICAN

01:02.395 --> 01:03.813
IT MAKES IT EVEN HARDER.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.355
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.277
[whispers]
BLACK DON'T CRACK.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.946
DO I HAVE TO WHISPER
IF IT'S A COMPLIMENT?

01:12.030 --> 01:14.199
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
ASK HIM HOW OLD HE IS?

01:14.282 --> 01:16.785
- BECAUSE THEN HE MIGHT
ASK HOW OLD I AM,

01:16.868 --> 01:20.330
AND I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.665
- I HAVE A DATE WITH CUTE,
CUDDLY, FUNNY ANDY.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.709
DID I TELL YOU THAT HE
COACHES KID'S SOCCER?

01:24.793 --> 01:27.295
- OH, SOUNDS POOR.

01:27.378 --> 01:29.005
- VICTORIA!

01:29.088 --> 01:31.049
ANYWAY, I THINK
TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.

01:31.132 --> 01:32.634
IT'S OUR 12TH DATE.

01:32.717 --> 01:35.470
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN HOLD
OUT TILL THE 12TH DATE.

01:35.553 --> 01:36.513
I NEVER COULD.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.349
- LIKE YOU EVER HAD
A 12TH DATE.

01:50.735 --> 01:51.861
{\an8}- TO YOUR BEAUTY.

01:51.945 --> 01:52.862
{\an8}- WELL, I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.949
{\an8}[both laugh]

01:58.785 --> 02:02.247
{\an8}OH, MY GOD, YOUR HANDS,
THEY--THEY REALLY ARE AMAZING.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.415
{\an8}- YES, THEY ARE.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.917
{\an8}PROPORTIONALLY,
THEY'RE IDENTICAL

02:06.000 --> 02:07.961
{\an8}TO MICHELANGELO'S DAVID.
- HMM.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.211
{\an8}- THEY'RE VIRTUALLY PORELESS,

02:09.294 --> 02:11.673
{\an8}SO THEY DON'T SWEAT
UNDER THE LIGHTS.

02:11.756 --> 02:14.008
{\an8}AND MY SKIN IS
SMOOTH AS SILK, YET TAUT,

02:14.092 --> 02:16.886
{\an8}LIKE THAT OF A RIPE FRUIT.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.723
{\an8}FEEL HOW PLUMP, YET FIRM,
MY HAND MEAT IS.

02:28.147 --> 02:29.899
{\an8}- IT'S INCREDIBLE.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.403
{\an8}I DON'T EVER WANT THESE HANDS
TO STOP TOUCHING MY FACE.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.114
{\an8}- I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY
HAND JOBS

02:36.197 --> 02:38.032
{\an8}THIS BAD BOY HAS DONE.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.412
{\an8}- HAND JOBS?

02:42.495 --> 02:44.664
{\an8}- WELL, YES,
THEY'RE MY BREAD AND BUTTER.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.292
{\an8}IN FACT, THE HAND JOB I DID
TODAY IS PAYING FOR THIS DINNER.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.752
{\an8}- [laughs]

02:49.836 --> 02:51.045
{\an8}OH.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.255
{\an8}- OH, VOILA.

02:52.338 --> 02:55.592
{\an8}- [clears throat]
MMM.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.260
{\an8}- WHERE'S MY SILVERWARE?

02:57.343 --> 02:59.137
{\an8}- OH, THIS IS ETHIOPIAN FOOD.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.138
{\an8}YOU EAT IT WITH YOUR FINGERS.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.599
{\an8}- OH, NO.
[laughs]

03:02.682 --> 03:05.727
{\an8}NO, NO, NO, I CAN'T TOUCH
EXOTIC FOODS WITH MY HANDS.

03:05.810 --> 03:08.271
{\an8}THE SPICES MIGHT
DISCOLOR MY CUTICLES.

03:08.354 --> 03:11.733
{\an8}- WELL, UH,
I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.568
- WOULD YOU MIND?

03:17.530 --> 03:19.574
- MMM.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.622
- SO, I HAD TO
PULL SOME STRINGS,

03:25.705 --> 03:27.498
BUT I WAS ABLE TO GET US
RESERVATIONS AT FINIQUE.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.000
- OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.460
WE COULD GO THERE.

03:30.543 --> 03:33.171
OR, WE COULD GO UPSTAIRS.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.089
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:35.173 --> 03:39.260
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE FANCY
DINNER IS TO GET UPSTAIRS.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.138
OH, UH, TO BE CLEAR, YOUR
BEDROOM IS UP THERE, RIGHT?

03:42.221 --> 03:47.310
BECAUSE, OTHERWISE,
I'M REALLY HUNGRY.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.187
- I HAVE A THEORY THAT
THE MUSIC YOU LISTEN TO

03:49.270 --> 03:50.647
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG DEFINES YOU.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.690
FOR ME IT WAS '80s MUSIC:

03:52.774 --> 03:55.818
U2, MICHAEL JACKSON, PRINCE.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.946
HOW ABOUT FOR YOU?

03:58.029 --> 04:00.323
- WELL, WHEN I WAS YOUNG,
I STUDIED THE PIANO.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.699
SO I WAS INTO BAROQUE MUSIC:

04:01.783 --> 04:04.243
BACH, HANDEL, VIVALDI.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.286
OH, I LOVE THAT ERA,

04:05.370 --> 04:06.871
BECAUSE IT'S SO...

04:06.955 --> 04:09.666
- AGELESS?
- YES.

04:09.749 --> 04:10.667
- WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

04:10.750 --> 04:14.545
I'M GOING TO USE THE RESTROOM.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.339
EXCUSE ME.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.007
DO YOU SEE MY DATE OVER THERE?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.634
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK HE IS?

04:19.716 --> 04:21.219
- HARD TO SAY.

04:21.302 --> 04:25.014
I CAN'T TELL IF HE'S 45
OR YOUR AGE.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.183
- HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM?

04:27.266 --> 04:29.560
- I DON'T KNOW, 60?

04:29.644 --> 04:30.979
IT'S HARD TO TELL
WITH WHITE PEOPLE.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.690
YOU CRACK.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.026
- ELKA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:37.110 --> 04:39.195
I--I THOUGHT WE WERE
MEETING IN THE RESTAURANT.

04:39.278 --> 04:42.532
- I THOUGHT AN
INDOOR PICNIC WOULD BE FUN.

04:42.615 --> 04:43.700
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR PLACE.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.035
- OH, IT'S A MESS RIGHT NOW.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.537
YOU KNOW WHERE
MY FAVORITE PLACE IS

04:47.620 --> 04:48.746
FOR AN INDOOR PICNIC?

04:48.830 --> 04:50.707
OUTDOORS...LET'S GO.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.834
- ARE YOU HIDING SOMETHING?

04:52.917 --> 04:54.877
- ROY, WHO'S AT THE DOOR?

04:54.961 --> 04:56.713
- YOU SAID YOUR WIFE DIED.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.089
- SHE DID.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.173
THAT'S MY MOTHER.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.426
- OH, YOUR MOTHER?

05:01.509 --> 05:03.553
HOW OLD IS SHE?

05:03.636 --> 05:07.890
- THAT'S A RUDE QUESTION.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.767
- UH, ELKA, THIS IS MY MOTHER.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.394
MOTHER, THIS IS ELKA.

05:11.477 --> 05:14.063
- HOW DO YOU DO, UH,
NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.399
- YOU REMIND ME
OF ROY'S FIRST WIFE.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.567
- THANK YOU.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.403
- I DIDN'T LIKE HER EITHER.

05:26.993 --> 05:27.910
- HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DATE

05:27.994 --> 05:29.746
IF YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T APPROVE?

05:29.829 --> 05:31.706
- ELKA, WE'RE GROWN-UPS.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.751
WE DON'T NEED HER APPROVAL.

05:34.834 --> 05:39.088
WE CAN JUST SNEAK AROUND.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.424
- I WISH YOUR FATHER
WAS STILL AROUND.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.759
SO HE'D KEEP HER OCCUPIED.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.553
- OH, I WISH HE WAS TOO.

05:45.636 --> 05:50.058
BUT, THEY BROKE UP LAST YEAR
AND HE MOVED TO BOSTON.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.435
[phone beeps]

05:52.518 --> 05:54.562
OH, IT'S MOTHER.

05:54.645 --> 05:55.938
SHE'S HAVING CHEST PAIN.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.107
- OH, NO.
- OH, I'M SORRY, ELKA.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.108
I'LL CALL YOU SOON.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.194
- OH, OF COURSE.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.157
- HEY, WHAT HAPPENED WITH ROY?

06:06.240 --> 06:09.243
- OH, HIS MOTHER
ISN'T FEELING WELL.

06:09.327 --> 06:12.789
- I'M SORRY?

06:12.872 --> 06:13.831
HIS MOTHER?

06:13.915 --> 06:16.667
WELL, HOW OLD IS SHE, LIKE 110?

06:16.751 --> 06:20.797
- YES, NEXT WEEK.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.299
I JUST MET HER,
AND SHE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.927
- WHY, DID YOU BRING UP
SOME HOT-BUTTON ISSUE

06:26.010 --> 06:30.473
LIKE THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR?

06:30.556 --> 06:31.641
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

06:31.724 --> 06:34.477
- UGH, OH, CHAD'S CAR
GOT A FLAT

06:34.560 --> 06:37.647
AND SINCE HE HAS
A...JOB TOMORROW,

06:37.730 --> 06:41.984
I HAD TO CHANGE THE TIRE
TO PROTECT HIS HANDS.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.570
HE'S A MODEL.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.530
[phone rings]

06:45.613 --> 06:47.406
OH, YOUR PHONE.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.827
- OH, IT'S FROM ROY'S MOTHER.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.496
THAT BITCH!

06:53.579 --> 06:56.207
- ELKA!

06:56.290 --> 06:59.168
"I CAN FAKE
A HEART ATTACK WHENEVER I WANT.

06:59.252 --> 07:03.172
G-T, G-T, P-I-R-I-O."
WHAT--WHAT IS THAT?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.508
- IT'S SENIOR TEXT.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.386
GOTTA GO,
<i>THE PRICE IS RIGHT</i> IS ON.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.020
- SO, HOW OLD IS LOU?

07:18.104 --> 07:18.855
- NO IDEA.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.357
THE MAN IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO PIN DOWN.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.236
{\an1}- MAYBE INSTEAD OF DATING HIM,
YOU SHOULD BE CARBON-DATING HIM.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.200
- [sighs]
- WOW, THAT WAS GREAT.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.536
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT WAS FANTASTIC.

07:33.619 --> 07:34.954
UP HIGH.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.414
- WHICH ONE OF US
ARE WE HIGH FIVING?

07:36.497 --> 07:37.707
- TEAM EFFORT.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.543
THERE'S NO "I" IN ORGASM.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.172
[sighs]

07:44.255 --> 07:46.757
WELL, NOW THAT WE CAME
UPSTAIRS,

07:46.841 --> 07:49.010
I'M KINDA MISSING
THAT FANCY DINNER.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.720
- WELL, I COULD
MAKE YOU SOMETHING.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.347
- OH, NO, IT'S OKAY.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.559
I'LL GO GRAB US A SNACK
FROM THE KITCHEN.

07:56.642 --> 07:59.395
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- OKAY.

08:03.649 --> 08:04.775
WHOOPSY.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.903
- WHAT?

08:06.986 --> 08:08.696
- DO YOU WANT YOUR BOXERS?

08:08.779 --> 08:10.615
BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE HERE
SOMEWHERE; I CAN FIND THEM.

08:10.698 --> 08:11.908
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.659
I'M GOOD, UNLESS IT BOTHERS YOU.

08:13.743 --> 08:17.455
- NO, NO, NO.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.624
I LOVE IT.
[both laugh]

08:19.707 --> 08:21.584
I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
FEEL A LITTLE EXPOSED.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.919
- WELL, YOUR ROOMMATES
AREN'T HOME YET, RIGHT?

08:23.002 --> 08:28.132
- NO.
- WELL, THEN I'M COOL.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.010
- MY GOD, THESE PIEROGI
ARE SO GOOD.

08:34.804 --> 08:35.847
DON'T LOOK NOW,

08:35.932 --> 08:36.974
BUT ANDY'S IN OUR KITCHEN

08:37.058 --> 08:38.893
AND HE'S HALF-NAKED.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.311
- OH, MY GOSH, YUM.

08:43.856 --> 08:47.818
- RED SHIRT, NO PANTS--
THAT'S AN INTERESTING LOOK.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.238
- HE LOOKS LIKE WINNIE THE POOH.

08:54.867 --> 08:55.910
- MORNING, EVERYONE.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.829
- MORNING.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.289
- SO HOW WAS THE 12TH DATE?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.749
- OH, SO GREAT.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.334
YOU KNOW, WORTH THE WAIT.

09:03.417 --> 09:07.088
- BUT?

09:07.171 --> 09:08.756
- OKAY, THERE'S A BUT.

09:08.839 --> 09:12.009
- WE KNOW.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.553
AN ACTUAL BUTT.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.265
- OH, NO, YOU SAW HIM.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.141
- HE CAME DOWNSTAIRS LAST NIGHT.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.770
HE LOOKED A LITTLE
LIKE POOH BEAR.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.355
- THAT'S IT!

09:24.438 --> 09:26.816
- YEAH, IT'S A DIFFICULT LOOK
FOR A MAN TO PULL OFF.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.193
- IT'S SORT OF LIKE BEING
NAKED UNDER A TRENCH COAT.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.695
YOU KNOW, WHEN A WOMAN
DOES IT, IT'S SEXY,

09:30.778 --> 09:35.116
BUT WHEN A MAN DOES IT,
YOU CALL THE COPS.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.660
- I WANT HIM TO STOP, BUT
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BRING IT UP.

09:37.743 --> 09:38.744
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

09:38.828 --> 09:41.497
- YOU COULD ASK PIGLET.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.669
- LAST NIGHT,
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

09:46.752 --> 09:48.004
HE GOT UP TO OPEN THE WINDOW.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.006
POOH BEAR.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.340
THIS MORNING,
HE WAS SITTING IN MY

09:51.424 --> 09:52.508
LEATHER CHAIR READING THE PAPER.

09:52.591 --> 09:55.511
POOH BEAR.

09:55.594 --> 09:57.179
BUT I SAID I LOVED IT.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.390
LIKE YOU DO.

09:59.473 --> 10:00.391
- [giggles]

10:00.474 --> 10:02.852
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO NOW?

10:02.935 --> 10:05.354
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK
ROY TO TALK TO HIM.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.981
HE WAS A GUIDANCE COUNSELOR.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.691
HE'S GOOD AT TALKING
TO PEOPLE ABOUT STUFF.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.360
- UNLESS IT'S HIS MOTHER.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.321
- WAIT, HIS MOTHER?

10:13.404 --> 10:15.364
- ROY LIVES WITH HIS MOTHER

10:15.448 --> 10:17.033
AND SHE DOESN'T LIKE ELKA.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.868
- SHE JUST NEEDS
TO GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.870
OH, LET'S JUST
HAVE A COCKTAIL PARTY.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.079
AND WE'LL ALL TALK YOU UP.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.540
AND YOU CAN TURN ON
YOUR UNIQUE ELKA CHARM.

10:24.623 --> 10:27.835
- I AM DAMN LOVEABLE.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.295
- AND I'LL INVITE CHAD

10:29.378 --> 10:34.175
SO THAT YOU CAN ALL
EXPERIENCE HIS HANDS.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.968
- AND I'LL INVITE LOU,
AND YOU GUYS CAN HELP ME

10:36.052 --> 10:37.887
FIGURE OUT HOW OLD HE IS.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.513
- MAYBE ROY COULD TALK TO ANDY

10:39.597 --> 10:41.223
AND SUBTLY LET HIM KNOW
THAT HE SHOULD WEAR PANTS

10:41.307 --> 10:43.893
SO WE DON'T HAVE
TO SEE HIS...HIS...

10:43.976 --> 10:45.686
- HUNDRED ACRE WOOD?

10:45.770 --> 10:48.147
[laughter]

10:55.196 --> 10:58.407
- AND CHAD, THIS IS LOU.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.950
- HEY, THAT LOOKS
LIKE THE HANDSHAKE

11:00.034 --> 11:02.912
FROM THE GREATER CLEVELAND
MUTUAL BANK COMMERCIAL.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.413
- THAT WAS ME.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.458
I GOT A LOT OF MONEY
FOR THAT BJ.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.086
- BJ?

11:10.169 --> 11:12.713
- BANK JOB?

11:12.797 --> 11:14.715
WELL, I CAN'T GO AROUND
TELLING PEOPLE

11:14.799 --> 11:16.675
I MAKE MONEY DOING BANK JOBS.

11:16.759 --> 11:17.968
PEOPLE WOULD THINK
I'M A CRIMINAL.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.763
[all chuckle]

11:20.846 --> 11:23.182
- ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON,
CHAD, THIS IS JOY.

11:23.265 --> 11:24.725
- OH, HELLO.

11:24.809 --> 11:25.768
- OH.

11:25.851 --> 11:26.769
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

11:26.852 --> 11:28.979
- NO, IT'S JUST THAT UM,

11:29.063 --> 11:33.442
AS A HAND MODEL, I'M SENSITIVE
TO HANDS THAT AREN'T...

11:33.526 --> 11:36.654
GENDER-SPECIFIC.

11:36.737 --> 11:39.782
- JUST SAY IT.
SHE'S GOT MAN HANDS.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.912
- IS THERE SOMETHING ON MY FACE?

11:44.995 --> 11:49.917
- NO, NOTHING DEFINITIVE.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.461
- CHAD, THIS IS ANDY.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.130
- AH, OH BOTHER.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.466
- UH, I'LL GET SOME TOWELS,
OKAY?

11:57.550 --> 11:58.801
JUST KEEP YOUR PANTS ON.

11:58.884 --> 11:59.802
- OH, THAT'S OKAY, I'VE GOT MY

11:59.885 --> 12:00.845
SOCCER CLOTHES IN MY CAR.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.346
I'LL GO GRAB THEM.
- OKAY.

12:02.430 --> 12:07.143
- [hums]

12:07.226 --> 12:08.853
- YOU CAN'T LAUGH
EVERY TIME HE SAYS

12:08.936 --> 12:11.480
SOMETHING VAGUELY POOH-LIKE.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.441
- HE SAID BOTHER.

12:13.524 --> 12:17.361
YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT STUFF UP.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.487
[doorbell rings]
- OH, OKAY.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.697
ROY AND HIS MOM ARE HERE.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.781
ARE YOU READY?

12:20.865 --> 12:22.324
- REMEMBER, ALWAYS BE SWEET.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.493
NO INSULTS.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.329
- OH, IT'S GONNA BE HARD.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.041
- HI, WELCOME.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.627
- HELLO, EVERYBODY.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.337
WHICH ONE'S POOH BEAR?

12:35.421 --> 12:38.215
- WOW, OH, IT IS
BLUSTERY OUT THERE.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.513
- NEVER MIND.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.391
- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.478
- UH, MOTHER, THIS IS
MELANIE, JOY, AND VICTORIA.

12:50.561 --> 12:51.687
all: HELLO.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.856
- OOH, ALL SO SLENDER.

12:53.939 --> 12:57.568
YOU COULD PROBABLY LEARN
SOMETHING FROM THEM.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.653
- I TRY.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.822
IN FACT, I FEEL
I'M A BETTER PERSON

13:01.906 --> 13:03.324
JUST BY BEING AROUND THEM.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.034
- AWW.
[chuckles]

13:05.117 --> 13:06.702
- IT'S JUST AN ACT, JOY.

13:06.785 --> 13:10.748
DON'T GET ALL GOOEY ON ME.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.167
- ROY, THIS IS CHAD.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.712
- OH, CHAD, HI.

13:16.795 --> 13:17.880
OH!

13:17.963 --> 13:19.548
FEEL LIKE I'M
SQUEEZING A FLOWER.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.717
- OH, THANK YOU.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.761
- IT WASN'T A COMPLIMENT.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.888
- OH, BUT IT WAS.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.437
- AND THIS IS LOU MOORE.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.232
- LOU MOORE, UNBELIEVABLE.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.233
- ROY MILLER?
- YEAH.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.234
- I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.235
- OH, HOW ARE YOU?

13:39.318 --> 13:41.278
[both laugh]

13:41.362 --> 13:42.196
- YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

13:42.279 --> 13:45.491
- OH, YEAH, LOU WENT
TO MY HIGH SCHOOL.

13:45.574 --> 13:47.368
- WHAT?

13:47.451 --> 13:48.869
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.412
YOU WERE
A HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.623
- NO, LOU AND I WENT
TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.250
HE WAS A FRESHMAN
WHEN I WAS A SENIOR.

13:54.333 --> 13:58.128
[laughs]

13:58.212 --> 14:00.422
- LOU IS THE SAME AGE AS ROY.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.466
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

14:05.636 --> 14:07.638
- SO DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT
CHAD AND I ARE PERFECT TOGETHER

14:07.721 --> 14:09.431
OR ARE YOU JUST SAYING THAT?

14:09.515 --> 14:12.476
- NO ONE SAID THAT.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.937
- TIME TO BRING OUT THE PIEROGI.

14:15.020 --> 14:19.358
SO I CAN TELL
HIS MOTHER TO BITE THIS.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.985
- SINCE IT IS SUCH
A SPECIAL OCCASION,

14:21.068 --> 14:23.070
AND WE HAVE SUCH LOVELY GUESTS,

14:23.153 --> 14:25.489
ELKA HAS MADE
HER FAMOUS PIEROGI.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.367
- AWW.
[all cheer]

14:32.246 --> 14:33.622
- WHY AREN'T YOU CLAPPING?

14:33.706 --> 14:34.790
- OH, I NEVER CLAP.

14:34.873 --> 14:35.791
THE RISK OF DAMAGING

14:35.874 --> 14:39.461
MY FINGER PADS IS TOO GREAT.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.922
- ROY TOLD ME
THAT YOU MADE PIEROGI.

14:42.006 --> 14:46.302
I-I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO TRYING THEM.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.553
- WELL?

14:47.636 --> 14:50.472
- EH, THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.807
- YOU'VE HAD BETTER?

14:51.890 --> 14:54.143
- I MAKE BETTER.

14:54.226 --> 14:59.356
UH, ROY, GET THE PIEROGI
THAT I BROUGHT IN MY BAG.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.609
- YOU BROUGHT YOUR PIEROGI?

15:01.692 --> 15:04.445
- WELL, I KNOW
WHAT MY SON LIKES.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.322
- I REMEMBER THESE.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.825
{\an1}WE USED TO EAT THESE WHEN WE SAT
AROUND LISTENING TO THE RADIO.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.997
WHO KNOWS WHAT EVIL
LURKS IN THE HEARTS OF MEN?

15:15.080 --> 15:17.875
both: THE SHADOW KNOWS!

15:22.921 --> 15:25.007
- WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE, ROY?

15:25.090 --> 15:27.343
DO YOU WANT
THE PIEROGI LOVINGLY MADE

15:27.426 --> 15:30.512
BY THE HANDS OF YOUR MOTHER?

15:30.596 --> 15:33.390
OR THE ONES ELKA MADE?

15:35.976 --> 15:38.979
- WHY IS THIS SO TENSE?

15:40.397 --> 15:43.359
I'M NOT A FAN OF
SWEATY PALM MOMENTS.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.862
- SO, IF I WIN AN OSCAR,
WHICH I WILL,

15:46.945 --> 15:48.489
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
YOU WON'T CLAP FOR ME?

15:48.572 --> 15:49.490
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.158
I CAN GIVE A TERRIFIC SALUTE,

15:51.241 --> 15:52.868
DOUBLE FINGER GUNS WITH A MOUTH
CLICK. [clicks]

15:52.951 --> 15:57.039
OR I CAN GO CONTEMPORARY
WITH A ROOF RAISE.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.707
BUT NO
[silent] CLAPPING.

16:01.710 --> 16:05.047
PLEASE, CONTINUE.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.758
- GO AHEAD, ROY.

16:07.841 --> 16:11.887
PICK YOUR PIEROGI.

16:11.970 --> 16:13.972
- NO PRESSURE.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.939
- SORRY, MOTHER.

16:22.022 --> 16:22.940
MMM.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.358
- YES!

16:24.441 --> 16:27.403
- ELKA, THIS IS FANTASTIC.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.447
- WELL, I AM LEAVING.
- AWW.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.907
- UGH, MY HEART.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.076
- SHE'S FAKING.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.160
- I'M GOING TO FAINT.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.706
- I'VE GOT YOU.

16:38.789 --> 16:42.543
I USUALLY GET GOOD MONEY FOR
THIS KIND OF REACH AROUND.

16:44.461 --> 16:46.088
- I CAN HELP, I'M A DOCTOR.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.089
- YOU ARE?

16:47.172 --> 16:48.257
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THAT?

16:48.340 --> 16:50.342
- I RETIRED 20 YEARS AGO.

16:55.639 --> 16:57.558
- HER PULSE IS FINE.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.101
BUT I SUSPECT SHE'S
HAVING A PANIC ATTACK.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.102
WE SHOULD TAKE HER
TO THE HOSPITAL

17:00.185 --> 17:00.894
JUST TO GET IT CHECKED OUT.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.104
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, UM,

17:02.187 --> 17:04.440
OH, I'M SO SORRY, ELKA.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.108
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.568
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.779
I GOT YOUR PURSE.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.948
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT,

17:13.031 --> 17:15.451
ANDY,
THE POOH BEAR THING IS WEIRD.

17:15.534 --> 17:18.328
COVER UP, NOBODY WANTS TO
SEE YOUR JUNK HANGING OUT.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.085
- YOU WERE CALLING ME POOH BEAR?

17:25.169 --> 17:28.130
IS THAT WHY EVERYONE WAS
LAUGHING AT MY BEARS JERSEY?

17:28.213 --> 17:31.425
- WHAT?

17:31.508 --> 17:32.634
NO.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.178
YEAH.

17:34.261 --> 17:38.807
- I GET HOT DOWN THERE.
IT'S A REAL PROBLEM.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.267
YOU SAID YOU LOVED IT.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.478
- ANDY--
- NO, NO, NO, OKAY.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.855
WELL, THEN, JUST FORGET IT.
I'M DONE.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.648
THERE WILL BE NO
13TH DATE.

17:51.695 --> 17:54.698
- W...

17:57.034 --> 17:59.787
- WOW.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.498
QUITE AN EVENING.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.541
- YOU SHOULD LEAVE TOO.

18:04.625 --> 18:05.667
- WHAT?

18:05.751 --> 18:06.960
WHY?

18:07.044 --> 18:07.961
- I HAVE NO FUTURE WITH A MAN

18:08.045 --> 18:10.464
WHO WON'T CLAP FOR ME.

18:10.547 --> 18:13.175
- I UNDERSTAND.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.510
GOOD-BYE, VICTORIA.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.013
- COULD I...

18:18.096 --> 18:22.851
- ENJOY MY HAND MEAT
ONE LAST TIME?

18:22.935 --> 18:23.727
OF COURSE.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.000
- I LOVE DATING YOU, ELKA.

18:47.084 --> 18:51.046
BUT IT'S TOO STRESSFUL WITH MY
MOTHER FAKING HEART ATTACKS.

18:51.129 --> 18:52.881
- I UNDERSTAND.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.884
- GOOD THING IS
SHE CAN'T LIVE FOREVER.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.678
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
MY WIFE USED TO SAY

18:57.761 --> 19:01.348
BEFORE SHE PASSED AWAY.

19:01.431 --> 19:04.893
- DOES YOUR MOTHER HATE
ALL THE WOMEN YOU DATE?

19:04.977 --> 19:07.604
- JUST THE PRETTY ONES.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.732
{\an8}- AWW.

19:16.154 --> 19:18.532
{\an8}- OH, ELKA, WE'RE SO SORRY.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.450
{\an8}I THOUGHT I'D REACHED
AN AGE WHERE I DIDN'T

19:20.534 --> 19:24.746
{\an8}HAVE TO DEAL WITH
MAMA'S BOYS ANYMORE.

19:24.830 --> 19:28.584
{\an8}- YEAH, WELL, AT LEAST
YOUR MAN COULD FEED HIMSELF.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.127
{\an8}- AT LEAST YOURS DIDN'T
LEAVE AN IMAGE

19:30.210 --> 19:33.172
{\an8}YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.924
{\an8}OR YOUR LEATHER CHAIR.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.052
{\an8}- I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY ISSUE WITH LOU.

19:39.136 --> 19:43.098
{\an8}EXCEPT THAT HE WAS
AS OLD AS THE HILLS.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.268
{\an8}- YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING
AGE IS JUST A NUMBER.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.605
{\an8}IF YOU LIKE LOU,
YOU SHOULD BE DATING HIM.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.273
{\an8}- YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:51.356 --> 19:55.402
{\an8}I'M GONNA CALL HIM.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.779
{\an8}- [laughs]
JOY'S DATING AN OLD GUY.

19:57.863 --> 20:01.116
{\an8}[all laugh]

20:01.199 --> 20:02.910
{\an8}- WELL, THAT WAS WOW.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.953
{\an8}[laughs]

20:05.037 --> 20:06.455
{\an8}- STILL GOT SOME
FUEL IN THE TANK.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.290
{\an8}- I WOULD SAY YOU DO.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.710
{\an8}- SO, UM, MY AGE ISN'T
AN ISSUE FOR YOU?

20:11.793 --> 20:15.923
{\an8}- NOT AT ALL.

20:16.006 --> 20:19.760
{\an8}- GOOD NIGHT.
- NIGHT.

20:19.843 --> 20:20.594
{\an8}[rattling sound]
