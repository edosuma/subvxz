00:00.516 --> 00:02.507
Previously on "Chasing Life"...

00:02.532 --> 00:05.033
Oh, right, you have cancer.

00:05.088 --> 00:06.889
It's terrible. Great writer, though.

00:06.924 --> 00:08.691
There's a good chance
that April's gonna need

00:08.725 --> 00:10.457
to have a bone marrow transplant.

00:10.482 --> 00:12.528
Since Brenna's not a match,
we'll go with what's available.

00:12.563 --> 00:15.331
Natalie has agreed to get tested
to see if she's a half-match for me.

00:15.365 --> 00:17.366
She's like evil. She drugged Greer.

00:17.401 --> 00:18.971
You don't know that for sure.

00:18.996 --> 00:21.662
Brenna was just caught
breaking into Greer's house.

00:21.687 --> 00:23.973
Oh, my God, classic.

00:24.007 --> 00:26.859
I don't like sneaking around
and keeping this from them.

00:26.891 --> 00:27.991
Please have the surgery.

00:28.026 --> 00:30.515
He turned his head when he
heard his mother's voice.

00:30.540 --> 00:32.505
Not bad after a two-month coma.

00:32.530 --> 00:33.830
Leo.

00:33.865 --> 00:35.032
So...

00:36.334 --> 00:37.601
We're alive.

00:37.635 --> 00:39.202
Now what?

00:40.638 --> 00:43.367
- How is it?
- It's fine.

00:43.392 --> 00:44.492
It's oatmeal.

00:47.245 --> 00:49.313
- Hey there.
-  April.

00:49.347 --> 00:52.188
Good morning. We were just
having a little breakfast.

00:52.884 --> 00:54.985
Actually, I'm... I'm done.

00:55.010 --> 00:56.279
You hardly ate anything.

00:56.304 --> 00:57.529
I know, I just...

00:57.554 --> 00:59.890
I'm not very hungry. Thanks.

01:02.224 --> 01:03.911
How you doin' this morning?

01:04.587 --> 01:06.187
Same as yesterday.

01:06.222 --> 01:09.090
Still enjoying the pleasures
of having a nurse bathe me.

01:09.125 --> 01:10.884
- Lucky nurse.
- Oh, yeah.

01:10.909 --> 01:12.315
There's nothing hotter than a guy

01:12.340 --> 01:13.374
who hasn't moved a muscle

01:13.399 --> 01:15.722
or gotten any sun in four months.

01:15.747 --> 01:17.748
Well, I mean, it's kinda true.

01:17.970 --> 01:19.971
How else does Rob Pattinson have a career?

01:21.620 --> 01:23.220
Honey, you are gonna get out of here,

01:23.255 --> 01:25.156
and you're gonna feel
like your old self again.

01:25.190 --> 01:27.057
Yeah, myself with no motor skills.

01:27.092 --> 01:28.259
You're gonna get them back.

01:28.293 --> 01:29.960
And, hey, you start physical
therapy tomorrow, right?

01:29.995 --> 01:31.896
Let's just take it one
step at a time, okay?

01:31.930 --> 01:33.851
And be happy that you are alive.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.439
Oh, I sure am.

01:36.802 --> 01:39.026
Why did I change my mind?
I'd never change my mind.

01:39.051 --> 01:40.952
He's having a little trouble remembering

01:40.986 --> 01:43.137
the days before his procedure.

01:43.162 --> 01:45.930
Short-term memory loss
is a common side effect.

01:45.965 --> 01:47.690
I had a plan.

01:48.497 --> 01:50.297
I was gonna keep living on my terms,

01:50.322 --> 01:51.419
not like this.

01:51.537 --> 01:53.604
Now you have your whole life to...

01:53.639 --> 01:55.415
Until a tumor comes back.

01:55.808 --> 01:58.816
Which is exactly what happened the
last time we thought we got rid of it.

01:58.841 --> 02:00.651
Leo, you can't think that way.

02:00.676 --> 02:02.785
I'm sorry, Mom. I really don't have...

02:03.244 --> 02:06.513
Much control over how I think these days.

02:06.689 --> 02:09.524
You may have noticed I don't
have the best brain in the world.

02:36.722 --> 02:37.846
It's just hard to watch

02:37.880 --> 02:41.783
Leo lying there, barely able to move,

02:41.817 --> 02:45.055
and not tell him that I know the
reason he decided to have surgery.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.654
And you can't even play the cancer card

02:46.689 --> 02:48.790
if he gets upset with you now
'cause you're in remission.

02:48.824 --> 02:50.525
Hey, I'm still a member of the "C" club.

02:50.559 --> 02:52.660
In fact, this afternoon I have
an appointment with my oncologist

02:52.695 --> 02:55.930
to find out if the love child of my
late father's 25-year-old secret affair

02:55.965 --> 02:57.665
is a bone marrow match for me.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.834
Our conversations just
get weirder and weirder.

02:59.869 --> 03:02.537
Stop.

03:02.571 --> 03:04.739
I'm on to you too. Oh, hey, guys.

03:04.774 --> 03:06.157
Sorry, I didn't know
you guys were out here.

03:06.157 --> 03:08.560
Really? We were talking at full volume.

03:08.585 --> 03:10.568
Uh, let's just say we
were a little distracted.

03:11.851 --> 03:14.208
April, this is Orin, Morgan's...

03:14.233 --> 03:15.613
Boyfriend. He's my boyfriend.

03:15.613 --> 03:17.490
Oh, wow. When did that happen?

03:17.515 --> 03:19.433
Like an hour ago.

03:19.484 --> 03:21.418
Okay, mister, I'm gonna make you

03:21.453 --> 03:23.587
the best homemade French
toast you have ever had.

03:23.621 --> 03:25.723
Uh, French toast? Are we carbo-loading

03:25.757 --> 03:27.391
for a marathon or do we just love

03:27.425 --> 03:29.825
the look of, uh, cellulite in the morning?

03:30.595 --> 03:32.730
Did I say French toast?
I don't even know, like,

03:32.764 --> 03:33.864
why I said that.

03:33.898 --> 03:35.866
I... I meant,

03:35.900 --> 03:38.669
like, smoothies.

03:38.703 --> 03:41.356
- Dairy-free?
- Yes. Yeah.

03:41.381 --> 03:42.639
Obviously, duh.

03:43.775 --> 03:45.442
Hey, Beth, where's my smoothie stuff?

03:47.116 --> 03:48.615
Your smoothie stuff?

03:48.713 --> 03:52.160
All the... my smoothie
stuff that I always have?

03:53.436 --> 03:55.537
I think she ate all of my smoothie stuff.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.521
Ah, let's just go back to bed.

03:57.555 --> 03:59.623
Okay.

03:59.657 --> 04:02.274
Good idea. That's a good idea.

04:02.299 --> 04:05.512
And it's totally fine.
Like, it's not a big deal.

04:09.601 --> 04:12.469
At least she's not still
single and desperate.

04:12.504 --> 04:14.671
Now she's just subservient
and anti-feminist.

04:15.116 --> 04:16.721
And they're always here.

04:16.747 --> 04:19.315
Plus, I hear, like, everything.

04:19.476 --> 04:20.577
Everything?

04:20.612 --> 04:22.077
Luckily, if they start to do that,

04:22.103 --> 04:24.354
Morgan turns on this awful dubstep music

04:24.379 --> 04:25.947
that he really likes, and it kind of...

04:34.829 --> 04:37.898
Hey, have you seen Aaron? He's not
responding to any of my e-mails about

04:37.932 --> 04:40.205
the judicial corruption
piece I was gonna cover.

04:40.935 --> 04:42.903
He hasn't? Huh.

04:42.928 --> 04:44.694
That's strange.

04:45.940 --> 04:48.608
I cannot mess this up like
I did my last assignment.

04:48.643 --> 04:50.591
Hey, you sound pretty stressed.

04:50.616 --> 04:53.102
You know, if you want, I
could just take this one.

04:53.187 --> 04:55.475
Mmm, no. But nice try.

04:56.851 --> 04:58.367
Okay, I have to tell you something.

04:58.392 --> 05:00.687
Aaron reassigned the
judicial corruption piece.

05:00.963 --> 05:02.173
To me.

05:02.757 --> 05:04.558
He said you were on research duty.

05:07.202 --> 05:09.539
Is Aaron, like, demoting me?

05:12.731 --> 05:14.431
You know what?

05:14.456 --> 05:15.882
I'll ask him myself.

05:21.709 --> 05:23.944
Sorry, April, Aaron's super busy today.

05:23.978 --> 05:25.879
Oh, that's okay. I just
wanted to let you know

05:25.913 --> 05:28.682
that I walked by his parking
spot a few minutes ago

05:28.716 --> 05:30.577
and someone was towing his car.

05:32.411 --> 05:35.511
Becca, can you take care of
Aaron's phones for a second, please?

05:41.645 --> 05:43.327
Madeline, did you seriously book me lunch

05:43.352 --> 05:44.746
at Bay Say Bistro again?

05:44.771 --> 05:47.576
I think there was a toenail
in my chicken salad sandwich.

05:48.425 --> 05:49.675
How'd you get in here?

05:49.700 --> 05:51.900
I've been e-mailing you about
the judicial corruption piece

05:51.939 --> 05:54.211
that we discussed, and now
I hear it's been reassigned?

05:54.236 --> 05:56.223
Yeah, I gave that to Danny.

05:57.138 --> 05:59.269
Does this have anything
to do with my cancer?

05:59.647 --> 06:01.681
You botched a high-profile
interview last week.

06:01.716 --> 06:03.750
Did that have anything
to do with your cancer?

06:03.784 --> 06:05.165
That was...

06:05.393 --> 06:06.833
That... no, that was an accident.

06:07.271 --> 06:08.817
So, it was just you screwing up?

06:08.842 --> 06:11.721
I mean, it... it was
maybe related a little bit,

06:11.746 --> 06:13.380
- but it wasn't all because of...
-  Look.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.582
You couldn't recall a single
detail from the interview.

06:15.617 --> 06:16.985
You forgot to record.

06:17.032 --> 06:18.485
I don't care why it happened.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.421
I just can't give you another
important piece like that

06:20.455 --> 06:22.168
until I know it won't happen again.

06:22.193 --> 06:23.490
Make sense?

06:24.244 --> 06:25.431
Good.

06:25.597 --> 06:26.767
Good talk.

06:36.715 --> 06:39.415
I was wondering if I'd see
you while we were in town.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.622
My mom's, uh, she's parking the car.

06:44.657 --> 06:46.324
Mine too.

06:54.033 --> 06:55.669
You here for moral support?

06:55.837 --> 06:56.904
Sort of.

06:59.238 --> 07:01.005
I'm grounded.

07:01.687 --> 07:04.458
My mom doesn't want me out of her sight.

07:05.348 --> 07:07.868
Because of your run-in with the law?

07:08.056 --> 07:10.158
How is that lesbian lover of yours?

07:10.347 --> 07:11.805
We're not...

07:11.937 --> 07:13.471
Together anymore.

07:13.545 --> 07:16.580
You are full of surprises.

07:16.605 --> 07:18.506
Well, you don't really know me.

07:18.667 --> 07:19.986
So...

07:20.265 --> 07:22.099
You don't really know me either.

07:22.124 --> 07:24.908
Didn't you say that I was too
selfish to do something like this?

07:25.487 --> 07:28.222
Guess we're both full of surprises.

07:31.413 --> 07:33.047
So, how long are you grounded?

07:33.511 --> 07:36.050
I'm only allowed to go to
work until school starts.

07:36.084 --> 07:38.152
Where do you work? Wait.

07:38.187 --> 07:40.021
Let me guess.

07:40.809 --> 07:42.723
Hot topic?

07:43.382 --> 07:46.769
Actually, I work at a
tattoo parlor called Alchemy.

07:46.910 --> 07:48.512
In the south end.

07:49.489 --> 07:51.044
Ah. There you are.

07:55.227 --> 07:56.925
You must be Brenna.

07:58.021 --> 07:59.688
It's nice to meet you.

07:59.722 --> 08:02.156
Yeah. You too.

08:04.394 --> 08:06.013
I'm sorry, everyone.

08:06.138 --> 08:08.263
The parking structure was insane.

08:08.298 --> 08:10.279
I was waiting for a car to pull out,

08:10.304 --> 08:14.090
and this little red compact just
swooped in and stole my spot.

08:14.115 --> 08:15.304
Uh, Mom?

08:15.892 --> 08:17.893
Our rental's a little red compact car.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.307
I'm so sorry, Sara.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.930
I... I didn't see anyone waiting.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.570
Well.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.082
Everyone's here that needs to be here,

08:27.107 --> 08:28.661
except the person we're all here for.

08:28.686 --> 08:32.010
- Brenna, have you heard anything from...
- I'm here! Sorry.

08:32.046 --> 08:34.647
I missed the train. Um, hi, Olivia.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.184
Natalie.

08:36.210 --> 08:40.078
Um, again, thank you
so much for doing this.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.655
Well, shall we?

08:49.096 --> 08:51.064
Well, we have some good news.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.158
Natalie is a half-match.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.613
I feel like the Maury
Povich of bone marrow.

09:01.915 --> 09:03.876
Nobody ever gets that joke.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.874
So now what do we do?

09:05.899 --> 09:08.036
Well, we have to run a
few more tests on Natalie

09:08.061 --> 09:10.435
to make sure she's strong
enough for the donation.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.299
And then when April is
ready for the transplant,

09:12.324 --> 09:14.423
we'll bring you back to
Boston for the surgery.

09:14.991 --> 09:16.258
Surgery?

09:16.292 --> 09:18.961
Well, it's a surgical
procedure where we withdraw

09:18.986 --> 09:21.555
liquid marrow from both
sides of her pelvic bone.

09:21.831 --> 09:24.260
With what? Like needles?

09:25.205 --> 09:27.474
That you stick into my bones?

09:27.503 --> 09:30.539
We read online that it was
more just like taking blood.

09:30.573 --> 09:32.830
If Natalie was a full match
that's how it would be,

09:32.855 --> 09:36.334
but since she's a half-match, the
procedure's a little more complicated.

09:36.499 --> 09:40.209
But you will have anesthesia and you
won't feel any pain during the donation.

09:40.234 --> 09:43.437
April herself has had a
few bone marrow biopsies.

09:43.462 --> 09:47.131
I know it sounds awful. And,
um, it's... it's intense,

09:47.177 --> 09:49.011
but it's a lot scarier to hear about

09:49.045 --> 09:50.730
than to actually go through.

09:50.755 --> 09:51.927
Really.

09:51.952 --> 09:55.430
And you'd basically be saving April's life.

10:04.394 --> 10:05.460
Hey.

10:05.495 --> 10:06.669
Hey.

10:06.694 --> 10:08.517
Um, I haven't heard back from Susan.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.310
So how'd it go with Natalie and Olivia?

10:10.344 --> 10:11.444
Natalie is a half-match.

10:11.479 --> 10:12.886
Oh, that's good news.

10:12.911 --> 10:15.746
It's great news. And such a relief.

10:15.780 --> 10:16.780
You have no idea.

10:16.815 --> 10:19.383
And I'm almost done with Olivia.

10:19.417 --> 10:20.553
- Oh.
- All I have to do is

10:20.578 --> 10:22.223
get through one more interaction

10:22.248 --> 10:24.950
with her when they come
back for April's transplant,

10:24.984 --> 10:27.152
and then she's out of my life for good.

10:27.186 --> 10:30.055
- Then we can go back to normal, huh?
- This is normal?

10:31.455 --> 10:32.924
- Like cucumber?
- I do.

10:38.898 --> 10:41.566
Do I need to wear a bell around my neck?

10:41.925 --> 10:42.958
Sorry, Emma.

10:44.027 --> 10:45.928
We were being careful, Mom.

10:45.962 --> 10:48.797
Really? Well, I'm not exactly a ninja,

10:48.832 --> 10:51.270
and I've caught you both twice.

10:55.538 --> 10:57.439
This is Sara.

10:59.442 --> 11:02.144
So, when do you two plan to tell the girls

11:02.178 --> 11:03.944
about this new development?

11:03.969 --> 11:06.875
Because the next time, one
of them might catch you.

11:07.165 --> 11:08.430
We're gonna wait until...

11:08.462 --> 11:11.229
things with April's health are resolved.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.354
Resolved?

11:12.642 --> 11:15.305
You yourself said that she wouldn't be

11:15.330 --> 11:18.093
in the clear until she was in remission

11:18.127 --> 11:20.330
for three years.

11:20.963 --> 11:23.265
When's dinner? We're starving.

11:24.033 --> 11:25.967
George, did you hear
the news about Natalie?

11:26.002 --> 11:27.836
Yeah, it's great.

11:30.415 --> 11:31.540
Mom, what's wrong?

11:31.565 --> 11:33.200
Well, that was Olivia.

11:33.225 --> 11:34.790
She wants to meet with me tomorrow.

11:35.055 --> 11:36.179
About what?

11:36.204 --> 11:39.773
I think Natalie's backing out.

11:45.662 --> 11:47.563
Come on.

11:47.598 --> 11:49.104
Okay.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.903
Now, lift your right leg for me.

11:53.370 --> 11:54.603
Come on.

11:55.572 --> 11:58.554
Come on, let's show that leg who's boss.

11:58.625 --> 12:01.231
Apparently my leg is.

12:04.314 --> 12:06.898
Uh, hey, uh, can we...

12:06.923 --> 12:09.792
Can we wrap it up for the day?
I'm really not feeling so well.

12:09.826 --> 12:10.893
Fine.

12:11.168 --> 12:13.137
But we're doing a longer session tomorrow.

12:13.162 --> 12:15.880
I'm gonna go get the nurse
to bring you back upstairs.

12:16.366 --> 12:17.499
Feeling sick?

12:17.534 --> 12:19.435
Um, maybe, it's just the

12:19.469 --> 12:22.009
general nausea

12:22.034 --> 12:26.925
associated with accepting
my vast personal limitations.

12:26.950 --> 12:28.704
Believe me, I get it.

12:29.033 --> 12:31.980
It's frustrating to have no control.

12:32.015 --> 12:35.966
I just found out that the bone
marrow donor I had lined up

12:35.991 --> 12:37.786
is probably gonna bail on me.

12:37.821 --> 12:40.923
Somehow, you just have to keep
believing it's all gonna work out.

12:42.797 --> 12:44.668
Look, I know

12:44.715 --> 12:47.680
you said you don't remember why you
changed your mind to have the surgery,

12:47.705 --> 12:49.190
but I still do.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.622
Um, before your surgery,

12:52.657 --> 12:55.776
you told me that I needed
to fight for my life.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.078
And then you left me a voice-mail

12:58.103 --> 13:00.503
saying that you realized
after our little pep talk

13:00.528 --> 13:02.399
you weren't ready to give up either.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.967
You actually wanted to fight too.

13:05.236 --> 13:07.070
Leo?

13:07.105 --> 13:10.095
- It's time to go.
- Can we just have another minute?

13:10.120 --> 13:13.856
Ma'am, you're not even supposed to
be in here during physical therapy.

13:13.890 --> 13:15.624
We have him on a strict schedule.

13:15.936 --> 13:17.030
Okay.

13:17.055 --> 13:18.595
No need to call me "ma'am."

13:22.665 --> 13:24.636
Oh, God.

13:29.472 --> 13:31.356
Feel better, Leo.

13:40.016 --> 13:41.917
Honestly, she's terrified.

13:42.294 --> 13:44.614
They're not just putting
some needle in her arm,

13:44.639 --> 13:46.507
they're drilling into her back.

13:46.541 --> 13:47.875
Isn't there something else you can do?

13:47.909 --> 13:49.279
Yes, there are other options,

13:49.304 --> 13:51.420
but none of them are as promising.

13:51.538 --> 13:53.644
And I understand being afraid,

13:53.669 --> 13:56.571
but this could save April's life.

13:56.799 --> 13:59.162
Well, you have to understand.
It's not my decision.

13:59.279 --> 14:01.900
But you're her mother...

14:02.010 --> 14:05.904
And as mothers, we've all
made our kids do things

14:05.929 --> 14:07.796
that they don't wanna do.

14:07.821 --> 14:08.954
Natalie's a grown woman.

14:08.989 --> 14:10.523
And yet, she's not here.

14:10.548 --> 14:12.926
I'm not going to force her
into any painful situation

14:12.951 --> 14:14.178
she doesn't want to be a part of.

14:14.203 --> 14:16.020
We've all been forced
into painful situations

14:16.054 --> 14:17.855
that we had to endure, and yet,

14:17.890 --> 14:19.490
somehow we manage.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.759
Why don't you just say it, Sara?

14:21.794 --> 14:24.428
- Say what?
- Whatever you're holding back.

14:24.463 --> 14:25.696
Go ahead.

14:25.731 --> 14:28.266
I have no idea what you're talking about.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.750
I should go.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.543
Wait wait wait wait. Olivia!

14:31.568 --> 14:33.137
Just wait, wait. Please.

14:35.150 --> 14:37.767
I know the situation is uncomfortable.

14:37.792 --> 14:39.562
How can I even think about helping her

14:39.587 --> 14:41.588
when she has such obvious contempt for me?

14:41.623 --> 14:44.066
Because this isn't about you and Sara.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.660
And Thomas would have wanted his daughters

14:46.694 --> 14:48.262
to look out for each other.

14:49.039 --> 14:50.197
Look,

14:50.231 --> 14:53.869
if I can arrange a dinner
at the house with everyone,

14:55.169 --> 14:57.037
could you please just...

14:57.570 --> 14:59.438
make sure that Natalie comes?

15:00.595 --> 15:02.297
Let's see if we just can't

15:02.322 --> 15:04.056
ease her mind.

15:12.018 --> 15:13.618
I'll do what I can.

15:23.932 --> 15:25.533
Sorry.

15:28.327 --> 15:31.295
Make the changes I gave
you and send it to layout.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.231
Keep up the good work.

15:41.954 --> 15:43.331
What?

15:47.046 --> 15:49.013
Uh, Aaron?

15:51.230 --> 15:52.649
It was the cancer.

15:53.142 --> 15:54.165
Excuse me?

15:54.200 --> 15:56.134
That's why I forgot to
record the interview.

15:56.621 --> 15:58.422
My memory still sucks from the chemo.

15:58.770 --> 16:00.004
'Kay.

16:00.038 --> 16:01.806
That doesn't mean it'll happen again.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.575
I promise if you give me
another chance I will deliver.

16:04.610 --> 16:06.744
I wrote that piece about Bruce Hendrie
dropping out of the governor's race,

16:06.778 --> 16:08.579
so maybe if you have anything political

16:08.614 --> 16:10.481
- you need a writer for...
- Oh, yeah, that Hendrie piece.

16:10.515 --> 16:12.450
That was a big hit with
our female demographic,

16:12.484 --> 16:15.620
and our publishers are after
me for losing that audience.

16:15.654 --> 16:18.031
Cool. Write me another one of those.

16:18.056 --> 16:20.157
Wait, um... I'm sorry.

16:20.192 --> 16:21.334
Another what?

16:21.359 --> 16:22.593
Another cancer piece.

16:22.954 --> 16:24.588
Something for the Oprah fans,

16:24.623 --> 16:26.131
something that will make my wife cry.

16:26.385 --> 16:29.544
You... you want a sad cancer story?

16:29.569 --> 16:31.194
We need chicks.

16:31.219 --> 16:33.031
Chicks like to cry.

16:40.313 --> 16:42.288
It's a slow day.

16:43.262 --> 16:45.137
You want a tattoo? I won't card you.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.795
That's okay.

16:46.820 --> 16:48.621
I'll take one.

16:50.670 --> 16:52.877
Hey, Bren.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.010
Rebounding after Greer so quickly?

16:57.035 --> 16:58.115
Nice.

16:58.150 --> 16:59.951
No, Kieran.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.019
This is Natalie.

17:04.496 --> 17:05.556
Oh.

17:05.590 --> 17:06.691
Hey.

17:06.724 --> 17:09.079
So you're willing to
get stuck with a needle

17:09.104 --> 17:10.296
for a tramp stamp,

17:10.320 --> 17:12.882
but you won't do it to save someone's life?

17:12.906 --> 17:14.974
Would you let someone drill
a needle into your back

17:15.010 --> 17:16.844
and suck out your bone marrow for me?

17:18.713 --> 17:20.103
I didn't think so.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.486
Look, I know I'm not your
favorite person right now,

17:25.520 --> 17:28.589
but I thought that maybe we should
hang out or something while I'm in town.

17:29.143 --> 17:30.977
I mean, since we, like,

17:31.377 --> 17:32.975
share blood.

17:33.069 --> 17:34.128
Blood,

17:34.396 --> 17:36.291
but apparently not marrow.

17:36.963 --> 17:38.027
Whatever.

17:38.052 --> 17:40.726
I got invited to a tailgate
party at B.C. tomorrow

17:40.751 --> 17:42.232
by some frat guys on the team.

17:42.257 --> 17:44.870
They were idiots, but
it'll probably be fun times.

17:45.374 --> 17:46.975
Here's my number.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.573
Text me if you wanna come with.

17:51.344 --> 17:52.740
Bye.

18:00.304 --> 18:03.172
Kieran, could you cover my shift tomorrow?

18:03.197 --> 18:04.785
You're really gonna meet up with her?

18:04.857 --> 18:06.736
Thinking about it.

18:07.960 --> 18:10.336
Maybe I could get her to change her mind.

18:18.455 --> 18:19.504
Hey.

18:19.539 --> 18:21.606
April Carver to see Leo Hendrie.

18:24.210 --> 18:25.410
Oh.

18:28.930 --> 18:30.331
Something wrong?

18:30.356 --> 18:31.590
Um,

18:31.811 --> 18:33.958
Leo updated his visitors list.

18:33.983 --> 18:35.651
You're no longer on it.

18:36.285 --> 18:38.041
That's...

18:38.755 --> 18:40.522
he wouldn't.

18:41.228 --> 18:42.562
Sorry.

18:51.435 --> 18:53.045
If he has a problem with you,

18:53.070 --> 18:55.256
then maybe he really is
messed up in the head.

18:55.458 --> 18:56.831
Maybe you're right.

18:56.856 --> 18:59.925
Maybe I was just projecting
onto a guy in a coma.

18:59.950 --> 19:03.686
And you're right about our
conversations getting weirder.

19:03.711 --> 19:06.474
I mean, guys in a coma blowing me off?

19:06.499 --> 19:08.484
Secret sisters giving me bone marrow?

19:08.519 --> 19:09.670
Or not.

19:10.257 --> 19:13.325
God, what would we be talking about
right now if I never got leukemia?

19:13.350 --> 19:15.285
You'd be tweeting pictures
of what you ate for lunch.

19:15.319 --> 19:16.920
Totally.

19:20.958 --> 19:22.759
See, this is my day.

19:22.793 --> 19:23.860
Every day.

19:23.894 --> 19:25.628
Why can't you just go hang out at Graham's

19:25.663 --> 19:26.863
whenever they're like...

19:26.897 --> 19:28.430
"Dubstepping?"

19:28.773 --> 19:31.521
I mean, I could, but Dominic is there.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.037
And wouldn't that make
you feel kinda weird?

19:33.062 --> 19:34.807
Oh, no. Don't worry about me.

19:34.832 --> 19:36.920
I just feel like I'm breaking
girl code or something.

19:36.945 --> 19:38.261
Especially since it sounds like

19:38.286 --> 19:40.120
Dominic's still being
kind of a jerk to you.

19:40.154 --> 19:42.422
I mean, he kind of is, but I...

19:42.457 --> 19:44.358
I don't want you trapped in here with...

20:00.875 --> 20:03.326
Yeah, I'm gonna see what Graham's up to.

20:06.481 --> 20:08.935
Sara's not home. She's at the market

20:08.960 --> 20:10.872
shopping for tonight's dinner.

20:10.897 --> 20:11.962
Oh, okay.

20:11.996 --> 20:14.560
Will you just let her
know that I dropped by?

20:16.667 --> 20:19.060
All right, I just have to ask.

20:19.537 --> 20:23.739
Do you disapprove of me and
Sara not telling the girls?

20:23.764 --> 20:25.798
Or you just disapprove of me and Sara?

20:26.597 --> 20:29.221
Not sure why you need my approval.

20:29.246 --> 20:30.518
Oh, come on, Emma.

20:30.543 --> 20:32.144
You've never been one
to hide your feelings.

20:32.169 --> 20:35.038
And Sara's never been one
to hide anything either.

20:35.790 --> 20:38.077
Look, all I can say is

20:38.111 --> 20:40.980
people keep secrets when
they're afraid of the truth.

20:41.014 --> 20:41.981
Uh-huh.

20:42.015 --> 20:43.960
And what's the truth?

20:45.218 --> 20:47.753
There's an obstacle to your relationship

20:47.788 --> 20:49.922
that's not going away anytime soon.

20:49.956 --> 20:52.792
Her dead husband and your brother.

20:53.387 --> 20:55.488
Thomas has been gone for two years.

20:56.117 --> 20:59.025
Oh, listen to Sara go off about Olivia.

20:59.059 --> 21:01.928
It's apparent he's still very much around.

21:01.962 --> 21:05.698
If you disagree, you can
always ask Sara to go public.

21:05.733 --> 21:07.160
See what she says.

21:12.606 --> 21:14.283
If he takes the story somewhere else,

21:14.308 --> 21:16.406
I'll sue the little snot
for breach of contract.

21:16.847 --> 21:18.714
I don't care if he's eight years old!

21:20.876 --> 21:22.068
What's this?

21:22.181 --> 21:23.577
Um, my article.

21:23.689 --> 21:24.722
Yeah.

21:24.756 --> 21:26.224
It's not what I asked for.

21:26.258 --> 21:27.976
I'm sorry, but I just think

21:28.001 --> 21:31.135
that the inflated cost for premium
cancer treatment is outrageous.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.228
Didn't I say I wanted
you to make my wife cry?

21:33.298 --> 21:34.432
Yeah.

21:34.466 --> 21:36.300
You know what did not make my wife cry?

21:36.335 --> 21:39.103
An article about how
health insurance sucks.

21:39.137 --> 21:41.739
You know what my wife did after
she read the first paragraph?

21:41.773 --> 21:43.875
She turned on "Dancing With The Stars."

21:43.909 --> 21:45.610
I need something personal.

21:45.644 --> 21:47.206
You gave me a bunch of statistics.

21:47.231 --> 21:49.748
So you want me to write
more about my own experience?

21:49.869 --> 21:50.915
Sure.

21:51.388 --> 21:52.716
If it's sadder.

21:53.138 --> 21:54.958
Um, hold... sorry.

21:54.992 --> 21:57.727
Now I'm just feeling kind of exploited.

21:58.183 --> 21:59.250
Huh?

21:59.587 --> 22:01.664
I'm a journalist.

22:01.699 --> 22:03.533
My major was in poli-sci.

22:03.567 --> 22:05.601
- My background is in...
- Poli-sci?

22:05.636 --> 22:07.379
That is so interesting.

22:07.404 --> 22:09.171
Wait, what did you write your thesis about?

22:09.283 --> 22:12.185
Oh, um, it was about how protests in
Tahrir Square have shaped a generation...

22:12.219 --> 22:13.419
I'm kidding!

22:13.454 --> 22:15.833
I don't care. Look, I'm
running a business here.

22:15.858 --> 22:17.132
You're a writer-for-hire.

22:17.157 --> 22:18.958
Either you deliver the story I ask for

22:18.992 --> 22:20.978
or you go back to research duty.

22:21.095 --> 22:22.698
Your choice.

22:29.870 --> 22:32.839
We are B.C.! We are B.C.!

22:32.873 --> 22:34.707
Three, four, five...

22:34.742 --> 22:36.743
We are b.C.! We are b.C.!

22:36.777 --> 22:40.546
Whoo-hoo! You came!

22:41.225 --> 22:43.981
Yeah, my mom thinks I'm at work.

22:44.006 --> 22:45.725
Sweet. Let me grab you a beer.

22:48.312 --> 22:50.881
So are these the guys
that you met on the "T"?

22:52.316 --> 22:53.773
Honestly, I don't remember.

22:53.798 --> 22:57.021
Not that it matters. The best
thing about being young and hot is

22:57.046 --> 22:58.913
that you know everyone.

23:01.339 --> 23:02.428
What?

23:02.453 --> 23:04.499
Um, nothing. I...

23:05.093 --> 23:06.860
Do you think I roofied it?

23:06.885 --> 23:09.979
Brenna, I swear to God.

23:10.004 --> 23:12.729
I may be twisted, but I've
never drugged anyone in my life.

23:13.168 --> 23:14.769
Trust me.

23:23.578 --> 23:25.446
Yeah! Go Leo!

23:25.823 --> 23:27.989
I am your private cheering squad.

23:28.060 --> 23:29.640
Yeah! Come on!

23:29.665 --> 23:31.799
Did I tell you I was captain
of the drill team in college?

23:31.832 --> 23:34.424
No, but I'm not surprised.

23:35.949 --> 23:38.086
You know, your buddy is
not gonna get stronger

23:38.111 --> 23:39.339
if he keeps taking breaks.

23:39.364 --> 23:41.325
I just need to talk to him for a sec.

23:42.211 --> 23:44.011
It's your recovery.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.186
Five minutes.

23:47.108 --> 23:48.546
Sorry to just show up like this.

23:48.580 --> 23:49.898
I would have gone to your room,

23:49.923 --> 23:51.554
but I can't get up there now.

23:51.711 --> 23:53.951
Oh, yeah. That.

23:53.986 --> 23:56.047
Look, Leo...

23:56.989 --> 23:59.857
I know you regret your
choice to have surgery.

23:59.892 --> 24:01.826
But even if I had something

24:01.860 --> 24:03.478
to do with you changing your mind,

24:03.503 --> 24:05.272
it was still your decision.

24:08.534 --> 24:12.658
April, I get that you feel like we've
spent the last four months together,

24:12.697 --> 24:14.505
but we haven't.

24:15.167 --> 24:17.208
I wasn't there for any of it.

24:17.656 --> 24:19.205
And even though I'm awake now,

24:19.230 --> 24:20.937
I'm not the guy you knew.

24:21.132 --> 24:22.933
I don't have any balance.

24:22.967 --> 24:24.234
I can barely walk on my own.

24:24.269 --> 24:26.737
And I do appreciate you being here, but

24:26.771 --> 24:28.739
everything's changed.

24:31.042 --> 24:33.197
I guess I just thought that...

24:33.578 --> 24:35.484
Since we were friends
before, even if things

24:35.509 --> 24:37.305
are a little different now, we're still...

24:37.330 --> 24:38.363
That was then.

24:41.873 --> 24:45.269
And this new version of me

24:45.294 --> 24:47.542
doesn't feel like being friends.

24:48.710 --> 24:49.944
With anyone.

25:09.087 --> 25:10.664
Hey, kiddo.

25:11.055 --> 25:12.770
How you doing?

25:13.257 --> 25:14.870
Stressed.

25:15.147 --> 25:16.948
Yeah, I bet.

25:17.263 --> 25:18.263
Ah, don't worry.

25:18.298 --> 25:19.364
Dinner's gonna be great.

25:19.399 --> 25:21.433
Natalie's just, you know...

25:21.467 --> 25:22.940
Scared.

25:23.091 --> 25:24.664
We'll talk her through it.

25:24.719 --> 25:25.719
I hope so.

25:25.754 --> 25:27.495
I could use some good news.

25:27.520 --> 25:31.155
Leo just informed me that he
doesn't want me around anymore.

25:31.180 --> 25:33.214
Well, did he say why?

25:33.395 --> 25:36.154
I guess he just doesn't think we...

25:36.398 --> 25:38.618
Are as connected as I thought we were.

25:40.135 --> 25:41.633
He made me feel crazy, though.

25:41.658 --> 25:45.072
Like... like I invented the
whole relationship, or something.

25:47.208 --> 25:49.977
Maybe some relationships just can't be...

25:50.011 --> 25:51.879
Sustained.

25:51.913 --> 25:54.284
And no matter how much time you give 'em,

25:54.309 --> 25:55.683
because...

25:56.568 --> 25:57.808
Because what?

26:00.555 --> 26:05.245
Because of all the, uh,
obstacles that sometimes...

26:06.317 --> 26:07.984
Stand in the way.

26:14.401 --> 26:16.335
You know, I loved this band
before they were even signed.

26:16.887 --> 26:20.205
I saw them perform at a high
school carnival when I was 18.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.875
Now they're like platinum, and no
one even believes me that I called it.

26:22.909 --> 26:24.433
I'm sure people believe you.

26:24.458 --> 26:25.975
They probably just don't care.

26:26.980 --> 26:28.781
God, you are... just... you're mean.

26:28.815 --> 26:30.858
You love it.

26:30.911 --> 26:33.166
I do. You're a meanie.

26:45.382 --> 26:47.250
Oh. Sorry.

26:47.275 --> 26:48.408
Yeah.

26:49.077 --> 26:51.078
You wanna head to my room?

26:54.315 --> 26:55.949
We were on our way to the movies,

26:55.984 --> 26:57.835
and Veronica lost her contact.

26:58.156 --> 27:00.550
Did she check your mouth?

27:01.454 --> 27:03.782
You told me you weren't
seeing anybody else.

27:03.807 --> 27:05.806
- I'm not.
- Then whose is it?

27:05.831 --> 27:07.242
And don't tell me it's your mom's,

27:07.267 --> 27:09.414
because I've heard that
one before. And it's creepy.

27:09.439 --> 27:11.730
Actually, you know, his mom is pretty hot.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.822
Graham, shut up. Beth, can you please stop

27:14.847 --> 27:16.292
leaving your stuff around our house?

27:16.440 --> 27:17.508
Excuse me?

27:17.939 --> 27:19.443
It's Beth's bra.

27:19.478 --> 27:22.113
I let her change in my room
sometimes when she stays over.

27:27.986 --> 27:29.954
Yeah, I, uh...

27:29.988 --> 27:31.722
Love animal print.

27:31.757 --> 27:33.691
Reminds me of my home in the outback.

27:37.985 --> 27:39.440
Thank you.

27:48.373 --> 27:50.307
All right, bye, guys.

27:50.342 --> 27:53.393
Yeah, baby. Oh, you looking good!

27:53.418 --> 27:54.552
Nice legs.

27:54.586 --> 27:56.287
Looks like we got some fans of our own.

27:57.356 --> 27:59.190
- Hi, what's your name?
- Uh...

27:59.224 --> 28:01.316
Sorry, not interested.

28:01.341 --> 28:03.631
Hi, sorry not interested. I'm Kyle.

28:03.656 --> 28:04.836
And I think you're hot.

28:04.861 --> 28:06.748
How about giving me
your number or something?

28:06.773 --> 28:08.698
- Hey.
- What?

28:09.207 --> 28:11.898
- Is that your sister?
- Yeah. I'm her sister.

28:16.210 --> 28:17.877
You want her number?

28:17.902 --> 28:19.373
Come here.

28:24.331 --> 28:25.734
Closer.

28:27.434 --> 28:29.135
Ah!

28:29.169 --> 28:31.237
Dude, not cool!

28:33.073 --> 28:34.273
Amazing!

28:36.009 --> 28:37.376
You're insane.

28:37.411 --> 28:39.245
What'd I tell you?

28:39.279 --> 28:41.214
Fun times, right?

28:54.824 --> 28:57.277
I needed a day off like this.

29:02.269 --> 29:05.975
I've been really bummed

29:06.075 --> 29:07.516
about the Greer stuff.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.343
When I was in high school,

29:11.400 --> 29:14.435
I fell in love with this guy.

29:14.460 --> 29:17.064
He was a football player and a lifeguard.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.533
Can you get any hotter?

29:19.649 --> 29:22.618
Anyway, I basically wanted to marry him.

29:23.035 --> 29:25.136
We had all these plans.

29:25.171 --> 29:26.761
And then...

29:28.074 --> 29:30.784
His family moved to Pensacola and...

29:30.809 --> 29:32.911
You guys had to break up?

29:32.945 --> 29:34.361
Yep.

29:35.258 --> 29:37.304
And thank God, he's in prison now.

29:37.329 --> 29:39.897
I'm grateful every day
that one didn't work out.

29:39.932 --> 29:41.933
Otherwise, I'd probably be

29:41.967 --> 29:44.869
cleaning baby puke off
some second-hand couch

29:44.903 --> 29:46.661
somewhere in central Florida.

29:47.205 --> 29:49.812
The way I see it,

29:49.837 --> 29:53.230
there are a ton of great
loves out there for everyone.

29:56.919 --> 29:58.720
It's like...

29:58.786 --> 29:59.819
Life.

30:00.555 --> 30:02.386
You just gotta keep moving forward,

30:03.051 --> 30:05.266
one foot in front of the other...

30:06.020 --> 30:09.156
Until the next big thing
sweeps you off your feet.

30:16.838 --> 30:18.567
And we've gotta go.

30:18.592 --> 30:20.940
We were supposed to be at your
house 30 minutes ago for dinner.

30:20.965 --> 30:22.028
What?

30:22.062 --> 30:25.031
No, I can't go home.
I'm... I'm way too drunk.

30:25.065 --> 30:27.634
Chill. We'll sober up on the way there.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.168
I've got gum.

30:37.837 --> 30:40.739
Uh, you said Natalie is where?

30:40.774 --> 30:43.509
Oh, she always runs a little behind.

30:43.543 --> 30:46.171
Time's different in the
keys than it is up here.

30:46.196 --> 30:47.666
So, Olivia, have you been able to

30:47.691 --> 30:49.281
take in any of the museums or the wharf

30:49.316 --> 30:50.249
since you've been in town?

30:50.283 --> 30:52.351
Oh, I live on an island.

30:52.385 --> 30:54.987
The last thing I wanna
see are more fishermen.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.956
Brenna should be here
too. She got off work...

30:56.990 --> 30:58.617
30 minutes ago.

30:58.642 --> 31:00.059
We're here!

31:00.093 --> 31:02.761
Guess who I found walking up the street.

31:04.135 --> 31:06.589
Uh, great. So we're all here, Mom.

31:06.614 --> 31:09.380
- Do you wanna move into the dining room?
- No need to rush things.

31:09.405 --> 31:11.690
- Natalie, may I take your coat?
- Yeah.

31:14.831 --> 31:16.169
Hey.

31:16.194 --> 31:18.228
Have you been drinking?

31:18.635 --> 31:20.669
We were tailgating at the B.C. game.

31:20.694 --> 31:23.573
That's what you do when you tailgate...

31:23.997 --> 31:25.731
You were supposed to be at work.

31:26.168 --> 31:28.320
Did you give her alcohol?

31:28.345 --> 31:30.721
Brenna's underage. Way underage.

31:30.746 --> 31:32.380
I didn't give it to her. No.

31:32.414 --> 31:34.089
We pretty much took what we wanted.

31:34.114 --> 31:35.817
- Natalie.
-  Mom...

31:35.842 --> 31:37.823
It's my fault.

31:37.851 --> 31:41.463
Sara, she was totally responsible.

31:41.488 --> 31:43.722
It's not like we drove or anything.

31:45.943 --> 31:47.727
Brenna, what were you thinking?

31:48.064 --> 31:50.656
That I might get Natalie
to change her mind.

31:50.914 --> 31:53.683
Sara, she didn't make
your daughter do anything

31:53.717 --> 31:54.817
that she didn't wanna do.

31:54.852 --> 31:56.719
Wow! That's a convenient excuse.

31:56.754 --> 31:58.342
Sounds like you've used it before.

31:58.367 --> 32:00.101
- Mom.
- Is that a nervous tick for you?

32:00.126 --> 32:02.401
Every time you get a chance,
you instantly attack me

32:02.426 --> 32:04.427
with some passive-aggressive comment.

32:04.461 --> 32:06.462
I'm not gonna do this with you.

32:07.724 --> 32:09.163
You know...

32:10.134 --> 32:11.501
When Thomas first came to me,

32:11.535 --> 32:13.236
he said he was suffering.

32:14.228 --> 32:16.960
He told me you were rigid and uptight,

32:17.359 --> 32:19.378
that he felt trapped in your marriage.

32:19.403 --> 32:20.779
How dare you!

32:20.804 --> 32:22.437
All right, let's just calm down here.

32:22.462 --> 32:25.109
Okay, maybe I added the
"rigid and uptight" part.

32:26.028 --> 32:27.904
But I could read between the lines.

32:27.929 --> 32:29.530
Get out of my house.

32:29.605 --> 32:30.672
Mom.

32:30.706 --> 32:32.607
Come on, Natalie.

32:37.813 --> 32:39.326
You were...

32:39.749 --> 32:42.978
Really just hanging out with
me to get me to change my mind?

32:44.147 --> 32:45.981
Natalie.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.613
So what happened with that girl?

33:12.638 --> 33:14.037
Sorry, I forgot her name.

33:14.342 --> 33:16.473
It didn't work out. But it's fine.

33:16.498 --> 33:18.520
She always kinda annoyed me anyway.

33:18.767 --> 33:20.467
So then why were you dating her?

33:21.353 --> 33:24.388
I mean, it's not like we were
gonna get engaged anytime soon.

33:30.622 --> 33:33.538
You know, April used to always talk about

33:33.563 --> 33:35.032
what a great guy you were.

33:35.251 --> 33:37.098
And even before you dated,

33:37.123 --> 33:39.745
she said that you were
sweet and considerate.

33:39.770 --> 33:41.070
And...

33:41.571 --> 33:44.139
I'm just wondering if
that guy's gone for good.

33:46.930 --> 33:49.031
'Cause if so, then that's really too bad.

34:02.424 --> 34:04.198
Hey, you okay?

34:04.223 --> 34:06.521
Yeah.

34:06.959 --> 34:08.379
Mm.

34:08.404 --> 34:10.438
Not my finest hour back there.

34:10.463 --> 34:11.996
You've had finer.

34:14.141 --> 34:15.737
I don't know what happened to me.

34:15.762 --> 34:19.125
I guess I have more residual anger

34:19.150 --> 34:20.940
than I realized.

34:20.965 --> 34:22.864
Hmm, clearly.

34:25.341 --> 34:27.074
I'm sorry.

34:29.094 --> 34:31.900
You're not the right person
to talk to about this.

34:31.955 --> 34:36.358
Uh, obviously you need somebody to talk to,

34:36.391 --> 34:39.460
and I really wanna be that person,

34:39.496 --> 34:40.866
but...

34:41.871 --> 34:44.806
In this case, it's just too hard.

34:45.201 --> 34:48.270
I mean, if it was just,

34:48.304 --> 34:50.172
you know, your ex-husband or something,

34:50.206 --> 34:52.018
and you had all this baggage.

34:52.197 --> 34:55.551
You make it sound like I'm
still in love with Thomas,

34:55.576 --> 34:57.611
like I haven't let go. And
I promise you, that's not...

34:57.645 --> 35:00.280
No, I don't think that
you're in love with him.

35:00.314 --> 35:02.315
I just think that he's still in the picture

35:02.350 --> 35:03.800
for both of us.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.120
Maybe that's why we've
been setting all these rules

35:07.155 --> 35:09.289
and not telling people for four months.

35:09.323 --> 35:11.391
I just think that maybe...

35:16.130 --> 35:19.966
We know that we can't sustain it,

35:20.527 --> 35:23.922
that we can never be totally real.

35:23.947 --> 35:25.428
It is real.

35:25.453 --> 35:28.188
Well, if it's real, then
why don't we tell the girls?

35:29.619 --> 35:32.134
It's not the right time.

35:32.159 --> 35:33.542
See, I'm wondering...

35:34.289 --> 35:37.531
If on some level, we both know

35:38.521 --> 35:40.555
that there will not be a right time.

35:40.793 --> 35:41.826
So what are you saying?

35:41.860 --> 35:43.328
That you wanna end it?

35:43.796 --> 35:46.764
I think we're approaching a crossroads.

35:47.795 --> 35:49.945
I think...

35:50.536 --> 35:53.304
You are reading too much into this.

36:01.313 --> 36:03.147
Need help?

36:03.615 --> 36:05.515
No, I better do this myself

36:05.540 --> 36:08.141
if I wanna get back on Mom's good side.

36:08.176 --> 36:11.345
Not that that's even possible after today.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.146
I'm sorry.

36:13.181 --> 36:14.588
I know you were just trying to help me.

36:15.984 --> 36:18.141
Maybe you shouldn't have
gotten wasted while doing it,

36:18.166 --> 36:20.401
but I appreciate where
you were coming from.

36:21.628 --> 36:23.237
I just thought it was worth a try

36:23.271 --> 36:27.095
since I can't be the one to donate for you.

36:27.704 --> 36:30.706
You have to stop beating
yourself up about that, Bren.

36:31.048 --> 36:33.236
You are there for me
in plenty of other ways.

36:33.261 --> 36:35.518
Like today. I'm sure it wasn't easy

36:35.543 --> 36:37.244
hanging out with our secret sister.

36:39.991 --> 36:43.953
You know, "secret sister" isn't so bad.

36:44.235 --> 36:48.231
I think she just wants to feel
like a real part of our family.

36:48.265 --> 36:50.729
And the way that we went about

36:50.754 --> 36:52.838
including her in our lives,

36:53.349 --> 36:57.166
I think she just felt kind of...

36:58.275 --> 37:00.042
Exploited.

37:19.286 --> 37:20.808
Hey, can we talk?

37:28.024 --> 37:29.791
What?

37:31.470 --> 37:34.324
I can't imagine what it was
like to grow up the way you did.

37:34.349 --> 37:36.951
If you're here to feel sorry
for the fatherless love-child,

37:36.976 --> 37:38.533
I've had enough of that in my life.

37:38.558 --> 37:40.111
No, I'm...

37:40.136 --> 37:41.777
I'm here because I wanted to tell you that

37:41.802 --> 37:44.182
due to recent circumstances
that I won't bore you with now,

37:44.216 --> 37:47.437
I know what it's like to feel exploited.

37:47.493 --> 37:49.327
And I don't blame you and your mom

37:49.362 --> 37:51.591
for reacting the way you
did to me and my family.

37:52.264 --> 37:56.134
I just hope we can move
past the last few days,

37:56.168 --> 38:00.124
and somehow eventually
treat each other like...

38:02.108 --> 38:04.175
Well, like what we are.

38:04.718 --> 38:05.981
Sisters.

38:09.767 --> 38:11.334
If you want me to hug you and tell you

38:11.369 --> 38:13.218
that I'm donating my bone marrow now,

38:13.738 --> 38:17.340
I'm sorry, but it's not happening.

38:17.375 --> 38:18.601
It's not why I'm here.

38:18.735 --> 38:20.954
You can do whatever you want.

38:21.212 --> 38:22.866
I needed to do this.

38:37.963 --> 38:40.031
Here. My new cancer piece.

38:40.065 --> 38:41.866
Let me know what your wife thinks.

38:41.900 --> 38:43.501
Hey, hold up.

38:44.217 --> 38:45.518
What's this one about?

38:47.098 --> 38:49.356
It's not exactly what you asked for.

38:49.984 --> 38:52.819
It might make your wife
cry, might make her laugh.

38:52.844 --> 38:55.352
All I know is that recently

38:55.377 --> 38:57.319
I have been questioning what
my life would have been like

38:57.344 --> 38:59.512
if I never got cancer... And

38:59.584 --> 39:03.353
I am realizing all I
would have missed out on.

39:03.872 --> 39:04.972
What's that?

39:05.342 --> 39:07.343
Just gonna have to read it and find out.

39:16.167 --> 39:18.035
- George.
- Hey.

39:18.069 --> 39:21.038
So glad I was able to convince
you to sit down for a drink.

39:21.511 --> 39:24.107
Yeah yeah. Truth is I've been

39:24.823 --> 39:28.712
feeling restless
professionally for a while.

39:29.162 --> 39:32.131
I think maybe it's time for me to

39:32.165 --> 39:34.166
move on to the next thing.

39:34.729 --> 39:37.597
Well, lucky for you, my
flight back to San Francisco

39:37.632 --> 39:39.533
doesn't leave for another couple of hours.

39:39.933 --> 39:41.901
How about we talk numbers?

39:42.837 --> 39:44.771
Okay. Thanks.

39:54.121 --> 39:55.348
How'd you get in?

39:55.383 --> 39:58.251
I told the nurse someone
was towing her car.

39:58.286 --> 40:01.121
People are really nervous
about that sort of thing.

40:01.155 --> 40:03.973
And before you get mad at me
for breaking visitor rules,

40:03.998 --> 40:05.933
I just wanna say that I'm not stalking you,

40:05.967 --> 40:09.503
and I'm not crazy and I'm not projecting.

40:09.537 --> 40:11.096
I didn't say a word.

40:19.997 --> 40:23.867
Look, I respect that you don't want
people you don't know watching you recover.

40:24.285 --> 40:26.620
But I know you.

40:27.892 --> 40:29.456
Maybe you don't remember,

40:29.490 --> 40:32.159
but we were cancer friends.

40:32.193 --> 40:35.203
And when I was the one that was
suffering, you were there for me

40:35.238 --> 40:38.106
I... I have to be the girl

40:38.133 --> 40:41.035
who hopes and prays that
she'll find a bone marrow donor.

40:43.351 --> 40:45.689
Yeah, the future is totally uncertain...

40:45.882 --> 40:47.749
maybe your tumor will come back,

40:47.784 --> 40:49.442
maybe my cancer will too.

40:49.702 --> 40:51.770
All I know is...

40:53.163 --> 40:56.677
The thought of losing you to the tumor...

40:58.015 --> 41:00.323
Was tragic.

41:00.348 --> 41:03.417
But the thought of losing
you like this is just stupid.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.854
Okay, that's all.

41:10.139 --> 41:11.406
Speech over.

41:13.880 --> 41:17.616
You just really hate not
being on lists, don't you?

41:22.118 --> 41:24.186
I was born to be a V.I.P.

41:26.753 --> 41:28.582
Does this mean you're
done being melodramatic

41:28.607 --> 41:30.045
about letting me visit?

41:30.941 --> 41:32.658
I'm not melodramatic.

41:33.004 --> 41:34.905
Your voicemails beg to differ.

41:34.940 --> 41:37.708
You're the one who calls
crying from chapels, all right?

41:37.742 --> 41:39.534
And whatever. You loved my voice-mail.

41:39.559 --> 41:41.493
It's probably on your
workout mix right now.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.697
Speaking of working out,

41:43.722 --> 41:45.177
you're just gonna sit there

41:45.202 --> 41:47.069
or are you gonna throw me the damn ball?

41:49.721 --> 41:51.422
Good catch.

41:53.109 --> 41:56.111
Your vitals are good and
your cell count is great.

41:56.136 --> 41:59.662
No drugs in your system, no diseases,

41:59.687 --> 42:02.366
genetic disorders or
antibodies to worry about.

42:02.400 --> 42:04.268
You are in perfect health.

42:04.302 --> 42:06.337
Guess beer does the body good.

42:07.090 --> 42:09.273
Does that mean I'm good to donate?

42:09.307 --> 42:10.407
That's right.

42:10.442 --> 42:12.409
When the time comes, you're the man.

42:12.444 --> 42:14.750
In the meantime, you two have a safe trip

42:14.775 --> 42:15.809
back to Florida.

42:15.843 --> 42:17.677
Oh, I'm the only one going back home.

42:19.346 --> 42:21.848
Natalie decided to stay
for a few more days.

42:21.883 --> 42:23.515
Really?

42:23.540 --> 42:25.591
Well, Boston is a great city,

42:25.616 --> 42:27.611
and you already have family here,

42:27.636 --> 42:29.943
so that's fantastic.

42:30.481 --> 42:31.983
Yeah.

42:32.727 --> 42:34.527
We'll see.
