00:07.710 --> 00:10.270
It looks like an opiate patch.
Maybe someone fed it to this guy.

00:10.270 --> 00:12.630
Was it you? Did you kill him?

00:12.630 --> 00:14.670
I've just had the police
on the phone.

00:14.670 --> 00:17.470
Why would they want to come here
if it's not suspicious?

00:17.470 --> 00:19.630
Mr Robson died in his sleep.

00:19.630 --> 00:21.910
Your sister was here.
What the hell does she want?

00:21.910 --> 00:23.430
You think he was murdered?

00:23.430 --> 00:25.710
That student's back
in reception again.

00:25.710 --> 00:27.390
You know, the good-looking one.

00:27.390 --> 00:29.230
What? Ollie?

00:29.230 --> 00:31.590
They're post-grads, right?

00:31.590 --> 00:34.030
Been looking at a few places
for my dad.

00:34.030 --> 00:36.230
It's like looking for a plot
in a cemetery.

00:36.230 --> 00:38.310
Many people live in care homes
happily.

00:40.150 --> 00:42.430
"I know who killed Robbo."
Who sent you this?

00:42.430 --> 00:44.030
Must be someone from the care home.

00:44.030 --> 00:46.630
We've got to get the residents
out of the lodge.

00:46.630 --> 00:49.110
I wanted to invite you
to our Halloween party.

00:51.590 --> 00:55.030
"I think they're going to
kill again." Drive.

00:55.030 --> 00:57.230
I would urge people
to stay where they are.

00:57.230 --> 00:59.310
Next question. Are you single?

00:59.310 --> 01:01.110
Water levels are still rising...

01:01.110 --> 01:03.230
Flood defences to the west
have been breached.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.790
People in the affected area
are being advised not to travel...

01:05.790 --> 01:07.990
A large volume of water
is heading our way

01:07.990 --> 01:10.750
and will almost certainly
have a devastating impact.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.310
..and, if possible,
to move furniture

01:12.310 --> 01:14.190
and treasured possessions upstairs.

01:14.190 --> 01:16.070
We could be trapped out here
for days.

01:17.670 --> 01:18.910
Jack!

01:18.910 --> 01:26.150
# Testator silens

01:28.310 --> 01:35.550
# Costestes e spiritu

01:35.550 --> 01:49.030
# Silencium

01:49.150 --> 01:57.110
# Testator silens. #

02:17.670 --> 02:24.590
# When they turn up the lights
And the dark, lonely nights...

02:24.590 --> 02:26.950
Come on, Jack.
I don't know the words.

02:26.950 --> 02:29.430
It doesn't matter.
Just come make a noise.

02:32.830 --> 02:38.870
# Nevermore, we'll be apart

02:38.870 --> 02:41.950
# Always together... #

02:58.150 --> 03:01.390
Hello? Hello, it's Conor.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.670
Are you with Jack?

03:03.670 --> 03:06.310
No. Isn't he home with you?

03:06.310 --> 03:11.510
No, no. I think he's out
in the storm. It doesn't look good.

03:11.510 --> 03:14.350
If you speak to him,
will you get him to call me?

03:14.350 --> 03:16.150
Yes, of course.

03:16.150 --> 03:19.270
I'm not going anywhere.
Is that clear?

03:19.270 --> 03:22.270
Just, please...

03:23.750 --> 03:24.910
# Always together... #

03:24.910 --> 03:27.630
Derek!

03:27.630 --> 03:29.790
Derek?

03:29.790 --> 03:32.830
It's all right. I'm fine.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.230
Flooding along the
Thames corridor is being described

03:52.230 --> 03:55.390
as the worst since 2014,

03:55.390 --> 03:58.390
with hundreds of properties
and families affected.

03:58.390 --> 04:00.550
Water levels are still rising.

04:03.830 --> 04:05.990
Hi there.
You've reached Jack Hodgson.

04:05.990 --> 04:08.550
If you leave me a message,
I'll get back to you.

04:08.550 --> 04:10.310
Hi, Jack, it's me.

04:10.310 --> 04:13.310
I'm just wondering if you're OK
and where you are.

04:13.310 --> 04:17.510
Your dad's just phoned.
He's worried about you.

04:17.510 --> 04:20.310
I'm worried about you.

04:20.310 --> 04:22.350
I hope you're all right.

04:22.350 --> 04:24.510
Can you call as soon as you get...?

04:26.430 --> 04:28.590
Are you coming back to bed? Yeah.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.310
Where's Derek's medication?

04:33.310 --> 04:36.110
It's in the Lodge.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.750
What was he taking? Gabapentin.

04:38.750 --> 04:42.070
It's for...
It's for neuropathic pain.

04:42.070 --> 04:44.590
Can he get something else?

04:44.590 --> 04:47.350
Hi. It's Nikki. Hi, Nikki.

04:47.350 --> 04:49.630
Are you at the care home?
No. I couldn't get there.

04:49.630 --> 04:51.670
We tried to join them,
but we couldn't get through.

04:51.670 --> 04:53.270
And it's not just the flood waters.

04:53.270 --> 04:55.630
I mean, it's fallen trees,
mud slides.

04:55.630 --> 04:58.350
We're not even sure if the road to
the care home's there any more.

04:58.350 --> 05:00.270
We're probably only about
a mile away.

05:00.270 --> 05:03.430
We've set up base at
the Nightingale sports centre.

05:03.430 --> 05:06.030
Have you spoken to either
Jack or Simone?

05:06.030 --> 05:08.950
No, we tried. But the storm's
taken out all the phone masts.

05:08.950 --> 05:10.830
I really hope they're OK.

05:10.830 --> 05:13.910
Does the name Janice Pitram
mean anything to you?

05:13.910 --> 05:16.790
Janice Pitram? No, why?

05:16.790 --> 05:19.910
She was a care home worker
in Scotland.

05:19.910 --> 05:22.470
Her boyfriend brutally murdered
his elderly parents.

05:22.470 --> 05:25.070
She was convicted for
aiding and abetting.

05:25.070 --> 05:26.750
What about her?

05:26.750 --> 05:28.390
Well, when she got out of prison,

05:28.390 --> 05:30.910
she changed her name
to Amrita Naidu.

05:30.910 --> 05:32.750
And she's now working at
the care home?

05:32.750 --> 05:36.150
Yeah, which she shouldn't be,
given her history of violence.

05:36.150 --> 05:38.590
DS Galloway... Look. I've got to go.

05:38.590 --> 05:41.070
I'll let you know if we hear
anything from Jack or Simone.

05:46.790 --> 05:49.510
What happens if Derek
doesn't take his medication?

05:49.510 --> 05:53.990
He will be in very great pain.
I can't watch people like that.

05:53.990 --> 05:56.070
Do you reckon that
I should make preparations?

05:56.070 --> 06:00.190
How do you mean? I can...
I can get morphine.

06:00.190 --> 06:03.550
What are you suggesting?
Just for when things get...

06:03.550 --> 06:08.550
Just for when he... Just if
the worst comes to the worst...

06:08.550 --> 06:11.590
This is a care home!

06:11.590 --> 06:14.070
How do we care for Derek
when he's in such pain? Hm?

06:17.430 --> 06:20.510
Are you mad? I just... I just...
I just want to help.

06:20.510 --> 06:26.230
Do you want to go back to prison?
And me with you? Hm?

06:27.390 --> 06:32.030
Now, please make sure that the house
residents stay in their rooms.

06:32.030 --> 06:35.030
And you, whatever you're planning...
I'm not planning anything.

06:35.030 --> 06:37.190
..just leave Amrita out of it.

06:40.030 --> 06:43.110
You know those text messages
I got sent?

06:43.110 --> 06:45.630
Well, whoever killed Robbo is here.

06:47.950 --> 06:50.670
Derek has gone walkabout again.
What?

06:59.670 --> 07:01.230
Derek?

07:12.550 --> 07:15.910
Derek?

07:15.910 --> 07:17.110
Pray to God...

07:18.750 --> 07:25.430
..you never have to experience pain
like this.

07:27.670 --> 07:29.390
Can you walk?

07:37.350 --> 07:39.790
Oh, God.

07:44.990 --> 07:50.110
Come on, Derek. Look, everyone's
really worried about you. Come on.

07:50.110 --> 07:54.390
You did it to Robbo.
You can do it to me.

07:54.390 --> 07:59.430
No, no. Mr Robson,
he passed away of natural causes.

07:59.430 --> 08:05.750
If that were the case,

08:05.750 --> 08:11.470
why are they here?

08:23.790 --> 08:26.310
All right?

08:28.630 --> 08:33.030
You all right? The battery's going.

08:33.030 --> 08:36.310
There's no power to recharge it.
Are there any more batteries?

08:36.310 --> 08:38.910
In the Lodge.

08:38.910 --> 08:41.550
Hang on.

08:41.550 --> 08:43.470
Keep an eye on them. Yeah. OK.

09:47.350 --> 09:48.710
Damn it!

10:19.630 --> 10:21.550
That... That...
That isn't the battery...

10:21.550 --> 10:24.310
I thought we needed a challenge.

10:24.310 --> 10:27.590
I-I-I'm going to get you
something dry.

10:27.590 --> 10:29.870
It's OK...

10:37.550 --> 10:39.270
There you go.

10:42.030 --> 10:43.910
You can't do that all night.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.550
Do we have a choice?

10:56.790 --> 11:00.470
..continues to grow.
A government spokesman has said

11:00.470 --> 11:04.110
more than Â£2 billion
has been spent on flood defences.

11:04.110 --> 11:07.710
But when a once-in-a-generation
storm like this occurs,

11:07.710 --> 11:09.910
there's very little
that can be done.

11:09.910 --> 11:13.470
Emergency services and the army
are attempting to evacuate those

11:13.470 --> 11:15.990
in the most urgent need,
but they are...

11:42.670 --> 11:46.110
You say nothing, OK, to Mrs Thorpe?

11:46.110 --> 11:47.390
What is it?

11:48.430 --> 11:49.830
Morphine.

11:49.830 --> 11:51.190
For pain relief?

11:54.910 --> 11:57.390
I hope it doesn't come to that.

11:57.390 --> 12:00.390
I looked for Derek's medication,
but it was all flooded.

12:00.390 --> 12:03.390
The drugs cupboard
must have been left open.

12:05.230 --> 12:06.750
It could have been the flood water.

12:06.750 --> 12:08.670
I'm going to get the blame for that.

12:08.670 --> 12:10.030
What, even for the flood?

12:10.030 --> 12:13.470
Yeah. You name it.

12:13.470 --> 12:16.190
Amrita, you're doing your best,
all right?

12:17.550 --> 12:21.270
Amrita, just one thing.

12:23.990 --> 12:30.470
Kate said Robbo left some money
for you in his will. I...

12:31.990 --> 12:35.950
I didn't ask for it, OK? I...

12:38.550 --> 12:41.350
I'm just as surprised
as anyone else.

12:41.350 --> 12:43.270
I'm not accusing you, Amrita...

12:43.270 --> 12:48.310
OK, it's not my fault that
Mr Robson is dead.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.990
OK? It's not...

12:50.990 --> 12:52.390
It's not my...

12:55.510 --> 12:57.350
What was that? I was just asking...

12:57.350 --> 13:00.510
You need to understand that
my staff has been under

13:00.510 --> 13:03.590
extraordinary pressure
these past two years.

13:03.590 --> 13:04.990
I can only imagine.

13:06.590 --> 13:10.270
I don't know how Robbo got hold of
a fentanyl patch.

13:10.270 --> 13:12.710
What about Dr Young?
Could he have given him the patch?

13:12.710 --> 13:15.190
We don't have a stock of fentanyl.

13:16.390 --> 13:19.030
I thought you said fentanyl
wasn't the cause of death?

13:21.390 --> 13:24.070
Are you saying that Robbo
was murdered?

13:46.270 --> 13:48.270
I'm here to see DS Galloway.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.630
Simone was sent a text message
by someone

13:53.630 --> 13:57.150
saying they knew who killed
Mr Robson.

13:57.150 --> 13:58.590
We rang the number, but...

14:04.430 --> 14:08.470
Robbo's son, Michael,

14:08.470 --> 14:15.110
tried to stop them using
Robbo's body for medical training.

14:15.110 --> 14:16.350
Do you know why?

14:19.430 --> 14:25.390
I tried to talk to Michael,
but he's a very angry man.

14:25.390 --> 14:32.270
He's angry with his father,
his mother, his sister, you name it.

14:33.350 --> 14:38.870
Did Mr Robson ever complain about
how his son was treating him?

14:38.870 --> 14:43.030
You mean physically? Mm.

14:43.030 --> 14:49.870
They argued a lot -
mainly family things, you know?

15:01.190 --> 15:03.150
Because the new defences breached,

15:03.150 --> 15:05.390
this whole area
is now completely flooded...

15:05.390 --> 15:07.750
There must be a way that
we can get through to the care home.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.710
We'd send up a helicopter, but
there's no chance in this weather.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.550
The whole network's down and there's
no physical way of reaching them.

15:13.550 --> 15:15.070
Not at the moment, at least.

15:19.470 --> 15:21.590
Mr Robson?

15:21.590 --> 15:24.030
Mr Robson, do you live near here?

15:24.030 --> 15:26.590
Yeah, I've just been helping out
some of the locals get to safety

15:26.590 --> 15:27.630
in my tractor.

15:27.630 --> 15:29.150
Can you help us?

15:29.150 --> 15:32.590
Do you know of any way that
we could reach the care home?

15:32.590 --> 15:35.310
This is Michael Robson.
He might be able to help us.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.950
There's an unmarked track
through this top field here,

15:39.950 --> 15:42.270
in between my farm
and Watercress Lane, but...

15:42.270 --> 15:43.350
Could you get us there?

15:43.350 --> 15:45.990
No civilians are going anywhere
until this storm is over

15:45.990 --> 15:47.430
and this water has receded.

15:59.670 --> 16:01.630
Are you lonely, Jack?

16:03.150 --> 16:06.710
No-one special in your life
at the moment?

16:06.710 --> 16:08.390
Apart from me, that is.

16:19.870 --> 16:20.990
Right.

16:57.190 --> 17:02.790
As flies to wanton boys
are we to the Gods.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.550
They kill us for their sport.

17:07.110 --> 17:08.870
What are you doing, Derek?

17:08.870 --> 17:10.510
Stay away from me.

17:10.510 --> 17:12.870
I just want to get out there...

17:12.870 --> 17:14.350
I can't let you do that...

17:15.750 --> 17:16.990
This...

17:19.630 --> 17:21.750
This bloody scar tissue -

17:21.750 --> 17:24.790
it's killing me,
but not quickly enough.

17:24.790 --> 17:27.910
Derek, come on.
Let's go back upstairs...

17:29.390 --> 17:31.510
If I were your father...

17:31.510 --> 17:32.910
My father?

17:32.910 --> 17:35.150
You wouldn't want this for him,
would you?

17:35.150 --> 17:36.430
Derek.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.790
Please. That's not my decision.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.030
Yes.

17:40.030 --> 17:42.910
It should be mine
and I want to make it,

17:42.910 --> 17:45.230
but these bloody stupid hands...

17:46.470 --> 17:49.270
You use that, you'll just end up
hurting yourself.

17:51.790 --> 17:54.750
You do it, then. In the vain.

17:55.990 --> 17:57.390
I beg you.

18:06.230 --> 18:08.230
Derek!

18:08.230 --> 18:10.070
He's fine. I've sorted it.

18:11.470 --> 18:13.310
Have you seen Amrita? No.

19:03.470 --> 19:05.270
Have you seen Amrita?

19:07.550 --> 19:09.430
I'll go help Mary
look for her, then.

19:10.710 --> 19:12.710
I'll come and help you in a second.

19:29.670 --> 19:31.470
She must be outside.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.750
OK.

19:53.590 --> 19:55.030
Amrita?

19:57.950 --> 19:59.350
Amrita?

20:08.870 --> 20:10.150
Amrita?

20:11.430 --> 20:12.710
Amrita?

20:26.670 --> 20:28.110
Amrita!

21:02.630 --> 21:04.030
Aah!

21:13.670 --> 21:16.750
Morning, Beattie.
Fancy some porridge?

21:23.550 --> 21:24.950
Where's Mrs Thorpe?

21:26.950 --> 21:29.350
Straight through that way, please.
Keep moving.

21:34.470 --> 21:36.310
Kate?

21:36.310 --> 21:37.910
Is it morning?

21:37.910 --> 21:39.190
It is.

21:45.710 --> 21:47.030
Simone?

21:47.030 --> 21:48.310
Nikki.

21:48.310 --> 21:49.710
Are you all right?

21:49.710 --> 21:51.030
Yeah.

21:52.310 --> 21:55.670
Jack? Are you all right?
Where have you been?

21:55.670 --> 21:58.070
Let's get this off.

21:58.070 --> 21:59.350
Sit. Sit.

22:01.510 --> 22:02.950
What's happened?

22:03.910 --> 22:05.030
Caravan...

22:06.110 --> 22:08.350
..washed away...
Was Amrita inside?

22:08.350 --> 22:11.590
I don't know. There was a light...

22:11.590 --> 22:13.470
Let's hope not. Let's get you warm.

22:13.470 --> 22:16.190
Morning, Jack. You look how I feel.

22:21.710 --> 22:23.150
Steve?

22:23.150 --> 22:24.790
Simone? Yeah?

22:24.790 --> 22:26.110
What is it?

22:27.790 --> 22:29.790
This man's dead. What?

22:29.790 --> 22:31.310
No.

22:32.350 --> 22:34.390
How?

22:34.390 --> 22:36.190
There's some bruising on his face...

22:37.270 --> 22:39.270
..and a puncture mark on his hand.

22:40.910 --> 22:42.350
Could he have done it to himself?

22:42.350 --> 22:43.790
No.

22:43.790 --> 22:46.150
Arthritis.

22:46.150 --> 22:47.150
Left handed.

22:48.190 --> 22:50.030
You wanted to see me?

22:50.030 --> 22:51.310
Derek's dead.

22:52.510 --> 22:54.110
Mrs Thorpe.

22:54.110 --> 22:56.390
I need to speak with
a Miss Amrita Naidu.

22:56.390 --> 22:58.990
We're looking for her.
She's been missing for hours.

23:01.230 --> 23:03.310
Jack. Caravan...

23:03.310 --> 23:04.750
What?

23:04.750 --> 23:07.390
Jack saw her caravan
being taken away by the flood.

23:07.390 --> 23:09.590
No! Was she in it?

23:09.590 --> 23:12.230
When you employed Ms Naidu,
how much did you know about her?

23:12.230 --> 23:13.310
What do you mean?

23:13.310 --> 23:15.470
Well, I'm assuming
that you looked at her references

23:15.470 --> 23:16.910
or an employment record.

23:16.910 --> 23:19.630
She came to us at
the beginning of the first lockdown.

23:19.630 --> 23:21.870
We were desperate for staff...
Something to put it in.

23:23.390 --> 23:26.830
Mrs Thorpe, we believe Ms Amrita
Naidu is a false identity.

23:26.830 --> 23:28.230
This is now a crime scene.

23:28.230 --> 23:30.270
I'm going to need
a statement from you both later.

23:30.270 --> 23:31.830
Mrs Thorpe,
you need to come with me.

23:33.630 --> 23:35.710
Can you get him some water?
Yeah.

23:37.910 --> 23:39.790
I think we should
get you to hospital.

23:39.790 --> 23:42.750
I'm fine. Hot bath, I'll be fine.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.590
I need to go home.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.310
I'm going to call a taxi.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.070
I called you.

23:51.070 --> 23:53.430
Yeah. Sorry, I missed your call.

23:53.430 --> 23:55.790
I tried calling you back.

23:55.790 --> 23:58.310
I was out.

23:58.310 --> 23:59.710
Fun times.

25:39.110 --> 25:43.670
You have one new message.
New message.

25:44.830 --> 25:46.630
Hi, Jack, it's me.

25:46.630 --> 25:49.910
I'm just wondering if you're OK
and where you are.

25:49.910 --> 25:52.510
Your dad's just phoned.
He's worried about you.

25:53.710 --> 25:55.390
I'm worried about you.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.030
I hope you're all right.

25:58.030 --> 26:00.390
Can you call as soon as you
get this?

26:02.750 --> 26:04.830
Are you coming back to bed?
Yeah.

26:08.550 --> 26:12.750
To save your message, press two.
To delete your message...

26:40.550 --> 26:42.550
Dad?

26:51.990 --> 26:53.310
Dad?

26:57.870 --> 27:00.110
Dad? What's happened to you?
What's happened to you?

27:00.110 --> 27:02.390
Don't you start. I slipped over.

27:02.390 --> 27:04.310
All right, I can do that.

27:04.310 --> 27:06.310
I'm doing it.

27:06.310 --> 27:08.430
An ambulance came?

27:08.430 --> 27:10.590
I never called them.

27:10.590 --> 27:14.790
That woman over the road -
did you ask her to look in on me?

27:14.790 --> 27:16.150
I'm not a child.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.550
I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry, Dad.

27:25.550 --> 27:27.950
What's all this?
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

27:27.950 --> 27:31.630
No, no. Don't fash yourself.

27:33.270 --> 27:34.630
You're my boy.

27:59.390 --> 28:01.430
I thought you were
going to take today off.

28:03.190 --> 28:06.550
Can I get you anything?
No, it's fine.

28:06.550 --> 28:09.110
I'm sorry about what happened
to Derek.

28:09.110 --> 28:11.310
I'm about to do his postmortem
so hopefully we can...

28:11.310 --> 28:13.190
Are the students coming to watch?

28:13.190 --> 28:14.630
No. Why?

28:14.630 --> 28:16.550
Were you with one of them
last night?

28:18.310 --> 28:20.070
I was with all of them.

28:20.070 --> 28:22.750
Ollie invited me
to their Halloween party.

28:22.750 --> 28:24.430
I drank too much.

28:24.430 --> 28:26.630
I don't really care.

28:26.630 --> 28:29.470
But I do care if you lose
your job... Jack!

28:29.470 --> 28:31.910
I heard him on the message
you left me.

28:35.950 --> 28:37.670
Ollie's just... Ollie.

28:40.670 --> 28:41.990
Sorry I'm late.

28:41.990 --> 28:43.390
You all right?

28:44.630 --> 28:47.470
Recovered? Yeah. I think so.

28:47.470 --> 28:49.270
I've never been so cold.

28:53.470 --> 28:56.030
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time.

28:56.030 --> 28:57.310
Yeah.

28:59.710 --> 29:04.950
When I left the lounge, to look for
Amrita, what were you doing?

29:04.950 --> 29:06.390
How do you mean?

29:06.390 --> 29:09.310
I saw you look at the green box
with the morphine.

29:10.830 --> 29:12.070
Uh...

29:13.390 --> 29:16.230
Derek had taken one of the syringes.
I was putting it back.

29:17.710 --> 29:19.070
Right.

29:28.710 --> 29:32.390
Recent injection mark on his
left hand, as noted at the scene.

29:43.870 --> 29:46.390
There are a few scattered
petechial haemorrhages

29:46.390 --> 29:48.510
in and around his eyes.

29:48.510 --> 29:51.870
Suffocation? Same as Mr Robson?

29:51.870 --> 29:54.470
Well, petechial haemorrhages
can be seen in natural

29:54.470 --> 29:56.670
and unnatural deaths.
Yeah, come on.

29:56.670 --> 29:58.470
I mean, two almost identical deaths,

29:58.470 --> 30:01.030
in the same care home,
same main carer?

30:01.030 --> 30:02.390
You mean Amrita?

30:02.390 --> 30:05.270
Yeah. We found the caravan,
but there was no sign of Amrita,

30:05.270 --> 30:07.630
or Janice Pitram,
as she's better known as.

30:07.630 --> 30:11.350
You think she killed Mr Galton?

30:11.350 --> 30:14.790
I was with her
the whole time.

30:14.790 --> 30:16.790
What, even when she went missing?

30:16.790 --> 30:19.870
She went missing before
Derek was found dead.

30:19.870 --> 30:22.590
Are you sure? Because that's not
what you said in your statement.

30:22.590 --> 30:24.630
For now, Amrita's
our number one suspect.

30:26.830 --> 30:30.150
The frenum is torn
and there are abrasions and bruising

30:30.150 --> 30:32.070
on the inner aspects of his lips.

30:32.070 --> 30:34.710
OK, just like Mr Robson.
I told you!

30:34.710 --> 30:38.310
Look, the injection marks suggest
that there's drugs in his system,

30:38.310 --> 30:42.670
and there's evidence
of suffocation/strangulation.

30:42.670 --> 30:46.070
Thank you, I'll follow it up. OK.

30:56.310 --> 30:58.790
What do you want? I was hoping to
speak to Dr Alexander.

30:58.790 --> 31:02.670
You shouldn't be here. Yeah, well...
Where are you going? Relax.

31:02.670 --> 31:06.710
Listen, I don't really give a shit
what you and Dr Alexander are up to,

31:06.710 --> 31:09.190
but... It's not... Listen to me.

31:09.190 --> 31:13.470
If you jeopardise her position
here at the Lyell, so help me God...

31:13.470 --> 31:14.710
Jack!

31:16.150 --> 31:19.070
She'll want to see me, all right?
Tell that to her boyfriend.

31:19.070 --> 31:20.950
They're not together any more.

31:22.910 --> 31:24.350
What, you didn't know?

32:25.350 --> 32:29.630
So, you and the student - what was
that all about? A misunderstanding.

32:43.350 --> 32:44.910
They've found a body.

32:46.670 --> 32:48.710
I'll let Nikki know!

33:02.150 --> 33:04.630
Thanks for getting here so quickly.

33:04.630 --> 33:08.710
We believe it's Amrita Naidu,
AKA Janice Pitram.

33:16.270 --> 33:19.630
Where was the caravan found?
About half a mile that way.

33:23.630 --> 33:25.470
So how did the body end up here?

33:26.670 --> 33:29.190
You saw the strength of the river
from the flood water.

33:29.190 --> 33:30.510
Yes, but...

33:32.190 --> 33:34.270
Has this body been moved?

33:34.270 --> 33:35.830
No, not that I know of.

33:42.030 --> 33:43.390
Who found her?

33:43.390 --> 33:45.190
A dog walker spotted her.

33:52.390 --> 33:53.790
What is it?

33:53.790 --> 33:56.750
She looks surprisingly clean.

33:56.750 --> 34:00.350
You see, she's lying on top of
the flood-disturbed vegetation,

34:00.350 --> 34:04.550
rather than lots of detritus
gathering on or around her.

34:04.550 --> 34:07.990
It suggests that she was deposited
here after the flood.

34:07.990 --> 34:10.230
Really?

34:10.230 --> 34:12.910
You've got all your photos of her?
Yeah, it's all done.

34:15.150 --> 34:19.190
There's no wrinkling of the skin
or any skin slippage

34:19.190 --> 34:22.630
to suggest she's been in the water
for any significant length of time.

34:25.270 --> 34:28.670
There's no obvious bloating either
to suggest prolonged immersion.

34:30.510 --> 34:33.150
There's mud on her boots
which hasn't been washed off.

34:35.310 --> 34:37.070
So how did she get here, then?

34:56.190 --> 34:57.950
Michael?

36:07.550 --> 36:09.030
Nikki, how's it going?

36:10.990 --> 36:14.190
Well, there's a strong smell
of smoke.

36:14.190 --> 36:17.230
Yeah. Jack lit a fire,
to get everyone warm.

36:17.230 --> 36:20.110
Particularly coming from her lungs.

36:20.110 --> 36:24.550
Both lungs were of normal weight.
They weren't hyper-inflated.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.990
There was no fluid
in the sphenoid sinuses,

36:26.990 --> 36:29.190
no water in the stomach
and no froth in the airways,

36:29.190 --> 36:31.430
so I don't think she drowned.

36:31.430 --> 36:36.270
So if she didn't drown,
but was dumped in a flooded field,

36:36.270 --> 36:40.350
stinks of smoke, what happened?

36:40.350 --> 36:42.790
Her tissues are more red
than normal.

36:42.790 --> 36:45.070
Carbon monoxide poisoning?

36:45.070 --> 36:47.630
Very good. If it was,
the blood will have raised

36:47.630 --> 36:50.190
carboxyhemoglobin saturation.

36:50.190 --> 36:54.870
She also had fibres under her nails
I'd love you to identify.

36:54.870 --> 36:56.550
Did you find anything?

36:56.550 --> 36:58.430
Chicken shit.

36:58.430 --> 37:00.550
From the soles of her boots.

37:00.550 --> 37:02.710
Take a look.

37:02.710 --> 37:03.870
What am I looking at?

37:03.870 --> 37:06.670
Frizzled feather fragments.
Don't try saying that drunk.

37:06.670 --> 37:08.350
Or sober.

37:08.350 --> 37:12.910
DNA from the feather suggests
it's a mutation in the KRT75 gene

37:12.910 --> 37:15.790
which causes feathers to frizzle.

37:15.790 --> 37:17.910
So not just any old chicken shit?

37:17.910 --> 37:20.430
Rare breed of Bantam chicken shit.

37:20.430 --> 37:22.230
And guess who has
a farm full of them?

37:28.910 --> 37:33.070
I'm sorry. That's why I'm here.

37:33.070 --> 37:35.550
It has to stop.
I was fine until you came back.

37:39.310 --> 37:42.950
Michael, put it down.
Michael, please!

37:42.950 --> 37:45.150
Michael, stop!

37:45.150 --> 37:47.110
No!

37:47.110 --> 37:49.430
I'm not going to do
what you tell me!

37:49.430 --> 37:52.990
Mum had the right idea.
You just pull the trigger...

37:52.990 --> 37:55.590
Michael, please, please put it down!

37:55.590 --> 37:57.390
Hey, Michael! No!

37:58.590 --> 38:00.710
I need your help.

38:00.710 --> 38:04.310
Amrita - we know she was here.

38:06.270 --> 38:07.550
How?

38:07.550 --> 38:09.630
Bantams.

38:09.630 --> 38:11.390
I found a feather
on one of her boots.

38:14.310 --> 38:18.270
She wanted my help,
but I couldn't -

38:18.270 --> 38:20.030
because she went behind my back.

38:20.030 --> 38:24.510
How? She knew what Dad was
going to do - donate his body...

38:24.510 --> 38:26.190
Why didn't you want him to?

38:26.190 --> 38:28.590
Cos nobody tells me anything -

38:28.590 --> 38:33.230
about Mum, about you,

38:33.230 --> 38:36.150
about Dad, anything!

38:36.150 --> 38:37.830
Our mother killed herself.

38:37.830 --> 38:41.950
Dad never talked about it.
No-one did.

38:41.950 --> 38:46.110
He wouldn't even let me go
to my own mother's bloody funeral.

38:46.110 --> 38:48.990
I didn't know that...
You weren't here!

38:48.990 --> 38:51.910
Is that why you objected?

38:51.910 --> 38:53.750
You wanted him to have a funeral.

38:57.030 --> 38:59.430
I thought I'd finally have
this moment

38:59.430 --> 39:02.270
just to say goodbye,
just draw a line, but...

39:09.350 --> 39:11.190
That's why I'm here.

39:13.270 --> 39:15.870
Please, Michael,
just give me the gun.

39:30.030 --> 39:32.830
Sorry I left and didn't say goodbye
the other night.

39:32.830 --> 39:34.350
What was it, the walk of shame?

39:34.350 --> 39:36.070
No way.

39:36.070 --> 39:38.830
It's the first time
I've enjoyed Halloween, ever.

39:41.030 --> 39:44.470
But, Ollie, I'm hundreds of years
older than you.

39:44.470 --> 39:46.990
Oh, it's just a number.
And it was totally unethical.

39:46.990 --> 39:49.430
You know, none of that stuff matters
if you don't want it to.

39:49.430 --> 39:52.550
Ollie, how can I teach you if I'm...
Start by giving me an A-plus.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.430
A-minus, then.

39:56.430 --> 39:59.430
Always room for improvement.

39:59.430 --> 40:02.830
Look, we can make this work...
Ollie, I can't. We're both adults!

40:02.830 --> 40:04.510
Shouldn't it be up to us what we do?

40:09.950 --> 40:15.190
When I was in your room
and I got calls about work...

40:17.350 --> 40:20.190
..I realised that
I shouldn't be there.

40:20.190 --> 40:22.030
I needed to be somewhere else.

40:24.710 --> 40:26.910
Somewhere else,
or with someone else?

41:47.630 --> 41:51.990
I told you, I had no idea
who she was. Had I known...

41:51.990 --> 41:55.150
It's very possible that she killed
two of your residents, Mrs Thorpe.

41:55.150 --> 41:57.790
No, no, I can't believe that.

41:57.790 --> 42:01.070
If it was anybody,
it was Mr Hodgson.

42:01.070 --> 42:03.990
Sorry, sorry. Are you saying
that Jack killed Derek?

42:03.990 --> 42:07.150
That night, there was a discussion
between you and Mr Hodgson

42:07.150 --> 42:09.430
about preparing for
a worst-case scenario.

42:09.430 --> 42:12.670
It was after Mr Hodgson had put down
Kate's poor dog.

42:12.670 --> 42:15.790
Yeah, the dog was suffering
and Kate begged him to.

42:15.790 --> 42:17.710
Well, how did he kill it?

42:17.710 --> 42:20.510
With a syringe and morphine.

42:20.510 --> 42:24.790
And you're suggesting that that's
what Derek was injected with?

42:24.790 --> 42:26.990
I'm not pointing any fingers.

42:28.790 --> 42:31.790
OK. But we're here about Amrita,
not Derek.

42:31.790 --> 42:33.510
What about her?

42:33.510 --> 42:34.990
Your stepladder.

42:34.990 --> 42:37.310
My stepladder?

42:37.310 --> 42:41.230
We found insulation fibres
under Amrita's fingernails.

43:27.630 --> 43:31.470
There's a crack
in the chimney breast.

43:31.470 --> 43:34.670
And I've taken fibres
for comparison.

43:34.670 --> 43:35.990
Are we sure?

43:37.910 --> 43:39.750
It's Amrita.

43:39.750 --> 43:42.590
As far as I can make out, she would
have needed that to get up there,

43:42.590 --> 43:45.030
but then someone
moved it afterwards.

43:46.870 --> 43:49.110
Jack just sent me this.

43:58.670 --> 44:00.150
When was this taken?

44:03.230 --> 44:06.110
I used to run...

44:07.310 --> 44:09.830
..a care home in Aberdeen.

44:09.830 --> 44:13.630
And Janice used to work for me.

44:16.110 --> 44:17.470
Everyone loved her.

44:18.510 --> 44:20.030
But she...

44:21.350 --> 44:23.990
She was so easily led, though.

44:23.990 --> 44:25.190
Or misled.

44:27.430 --> 44:29.590
I tried to help her.

44:31.950 --> 44:33.390
Save her.

44:34.510 --> 44:37.950
I tried to show her that her
boyfriend was manipulating her.

44:37.950 --> 44:40.750
I warn you now you're under caution.
You don't have to say anything.

44:40.750 --> 44:42.230
I want to tell you.

44:44.390 --> 44:47.070
Amrita had absolutely nothing to do

44:47.070 --> 44:50.510
with her boyfriend's parents'
murders.

44:50.510 --> 44:53.430
I knew that
when she was let out of prison

44:53.430 --> 44:58.390
she was banned from working as
a nurse or a caregiver.

44:58.390 --> 45:01.390
Everyone deserves a second chance.

45:01.390 --> 45:03.150
We needed her.

45:05.110 --> 45:08.270
She was devoted to these people.

45:08.270 --> 45:11.990
So you let us search
the entire building.

45:11.990 --> 45:15.270
You let Jack go outside...
She was frightened!

45:15.270 --> 45:16.870
She...

45:16.870 --> 45:18.590
Not for herself,

45:18.590 --> 45:22.350
but for me, because I gave her
a second chance.

45:22.350 --> 45:24.310
So you hid her in the loft.

45:24.310 --> 45:27.630
Well, I... I thought it would help.

45:27.630 --> 45:29.510
I...

45:29.510 --> 45:33.870
I knew it was smoky
but I thought she'd be fine.

45:33.870 --> 45:36.310
So you found the body and...?

45:36.310 --> 45:42.710
Have you never done something wrong
for the right reason?

45:43.910 --> 45:47.190
How did her body end up
in the middle of a flooded field?

45:50.350 --> 45:52.510
Even if she didn't mean
for Janice to die,

45:52.510 --> 45:53.950
it's still gross negligence.

45:53.950 --> 45:55.950
She could be charged
with manslaughter.

45:55.950 --> 45:58.390
Disposal of a corpse -
that's also an offence.

45:59.710 --> 46:02.150
Either way,
I don't think her or Janice

46:02.150 --> 46:04.390
had anything to do with
Derek's death.

46:08.350 --> 46:11.670
After Jack injected the dog,
how did he seem to you?

46:11.670 --> 46:13.350
What do you mean?

46:13.350 --> 46:17.030
Well, killing a dog,
albeit humanely.

46:17.030 --> 46:18.990
I don't think I could do something
like that

46:18.990 --> 46:21.670
without being deeply affected.
Something.

46:21.670 --> 46:23.750
Yeah, well...

46:23.750 --> 46:25.270
..it was suffering.

46:26.750 --> 46:29.310
Like Derek was suffering.

46:29.310 --> 46:31.630
You and Jack,
in both your statements,

46:31.630 --> 46:33.910
said that when you
left the room Derek was alive

46:33.910 --> 46:37.350
when you went to go and look for
Janice. Yeah. That's right.

46:37.350 --> 46:39.830
Mary told me that
Jack had a syringe in his hand.

46:42.190 --> 46:44.070
What happened to it?

46:45.310 --> 46:47.630
At any point,
when you left the room,

46:47.630 --> 46:49.830
did you leave Jack alone
with Derek?

46:49.830 --> 46:51.510
Yes.

46:53.310 --> 46:54.750
Yes.

47:05.870 --> 47:07.710
Derek was in a lot of pain.

47:10.950 --> 47:13.630
He wanted me to put him
out of his misery.

47:17.070 --> 47:19.590
It might have been
the humane thing to do, actually.

47:22.990 --> 47:24.990
But I couldn't do it.

47:24.990 --> 47:28.230
If it wasn't you, Jack,
then who was it?

49:07.070 --> 49:09.950
Nikki. Look, I've just
spoken to my super

49:09.950 --> 49:11.830
and she doesn't think
it's appropriate

49:11.830 --> 49:14.590
that Jack continues working
on the case. What?

49:14.590 --> 49:17.390
He's not answering his phone.
Is he there with you? No.

49:17.390 --> 49:20.070
OK. Well, if you speak to him,
can you tell him?

49:20.070 --> 49:22.070
I will. Thanks.

49:27.590 --> 49:30.190
Jack's been taken off
the investigation.

49:30.190 --> 49:32.870
Galloway's been asking Jack about
what happened at the care home

49:32.870 --> 49:34.910
on the night that Derek Galton
died.

49:37.470 --> 49:38.790
Simone?

49:39.870 --> 49:43.870
I don't know Jack as well as
you do... What happened?

49:43.870 --> 49:46.430
Before I left the room
to look for Amrita,

49:46.430 --> 49:48.510
I saw Jack with Derek,

49:48.510 --> 49:51.750
and it looked like he was taking

49:51.750 --> 49:54.190
something out of the green
medical box.

49:54.190 --> 49:58.430
You think that Jack injected Derek
with morphine? That's ridiculous.

49:58.430 --> 50:02.030
We've established that both
Nigel Robson and Derek Galton

50:02.030 --> 50:04.390
were killed in the same manner,
implying they were killed

50:04.390 --> 50:06.910
by the same person. Jack couldn't
have killed them both.

50:06.910 --> 50:10.070
Well, I know that, but I've
examined the syringe,

50:10.070 --> 50:13.390
and Jack's fingerprints are
all over it.

50:20.150 --> 50:22.470
Dr Alexander. Hi.

50:22.470 --> 50:23.950
Is Jack here?

50:37.390 --> 50:39.150
Shall I try?

50:40.870 --> 50:42.310
Dad?

50:42.310 --> 50:44.430
Hi, Jack.

50:44.430 --> 50:46.310
I'm with Nikki.

50:46.310 --> 50:49.390
She really wants to talk to you.

50:57.710 --> 50:59.230
Jack?

51:00.790 --> 51:02.310
Jack.

51:02.310 --> 51:04.950
Do you know what happened
before Derek Galton died?

51:07.350 --> 51:09.590
Please talk to me, Jack.

51:09.590 --> 51:11.350
Please let me help you.

51:15.030 --> 51:17.310
We get through everything together.

51:19.910 --> 51:22.630
You know I'll always be there
for you.

51:26.910 --> 51:28.590
Nikki?

51:52.670 --> 51:54.630
Come to arrest me?

52:03.230 --> 52:04.710
Have you told the police?

52:04.710 --> 52:06.670
The police think it was me.

52:06.670 --> 52:08.430
I didn't mean that to happen.

52:08.430 --> 52:12.150
What? Them blaming me,
or you killing Robbo and Derek?

52:17.550 --> 52:19.230
Robbo...

52:19.230 --> 52:21.230
..was haunted.

52:22.750 --> 52:26.070
He pleaded with me to help him die.

52:28.270 --> 52:29.630
And Derek...

52:30.990 --> 52:32.310
We were lovers.

52:32.310 --> 52:33.790
Does that shock you?

52:36.110 --> 52:39.310
I couldn't let him suffer any more.

52:40.790 --> 52:42.750
You played God.

52:42.750 --> 52:45.270
If someone's got
to play him, why not me?

52:48.110 --> 52:51.470
Where did you get
the fentanyl patches from?

52:51.470 --> 52:53.630
When I first came here,

52:53.630 --> 52:58.950
I was in such pain
I kept a few back for a rainy day.

53:00.270 --> 53:03.710
And the text message Simone
received? You sent that, didn't you?

53:03.710 --> 53:06.150
They couldn't trace the phone.

53:06.150 --> 53:09.710
Derek had worked out
it was me that killed Robbo,

53:09.710 --> 53:12.750
and he wanted me to do
the same from him.

53:14.070 --> 53:16.750
And I wanted you to stop me.

53:16.750 --> 53:19.950
I don't regret what I did, Jack.

53:19.950 --> 53:22.350
I'm done with all that.

53:22.350 --> 53:25.190
If this place has taught me
anything,

53:25.190 --> 53:28.270
it's to seize the day.

53:28.270 --> 53:30.630
If a thing feels right,

53:30.630 --> 53:32.470
do it.

53:43.990 --> 53:45.430
Um...

53:51.310 --> 53:56.110
I found some footage, um,
on a camera

53:56.110 --> 53:58.710
Michael had installed in
Robbo's room.

53:58.710 --> 54:02.110
The police will want to see that.

54:02.110 --> 54:04.550
Will they charge me with murder?

54:04.550 --> 54:06.470
Probably.

54:09.510 --> 54:11.830
Why did you suffocate them?

54:11.830 --> 54:14.110
I didn't mean to do that. I just...

54:14.110 --> 54:15.590
I...

54:16.710 --> 54:20.310
I couldn't bear to see their faces.

54:38.030 --> 54:40.270
Do you know who I blame?

54:40.270 --> 54:42.950
Bloody Peter Pan.

54:42.950 --> 54:46.230
"To die will be
an awfully big adventure."

54:46.230 --> 54:48.310
Death maybe.

54:49.910 --> 54:52.910
But dying and getting old...

54:56.230 --> 54:58.550
..not so much.

55:10.790 --> 55:13.230
When our mother killed herself...

55:14.750 --> 55:19.390
..I was convinced that I knew
the truth about my dad

55:19.390 --> 55:21.510
and about what had happened and why.

55:23.470 --> 55:25.230
But I was wrong.

55:28.190 --> 55:32.270
Sometimes the truth isn't what
we want to hear.

55:32.270 --> 55:34.910
And neither of us knew the truth.

55:36.430 --> 55:38.670
We just made it up,

55:38.670 --> 55:40.390
and that changed us.

55:43.550 --> 55:48.190
Both of us ran away inside.

55:48.190 --> 55:50.190
Well, we've stopped running.

55:53.470 --> 55:55.470
We can finally say goodbye.

56:30.350 --> 56:31.870
Hi. Hello.

56:31.870 --> 56:34.550
So, Galloway was just here.

56:34.550 --> 56:37.230
I think I owe you an apology.

56:37.230 --> 56:39.670
For thinking I was a murderer?
No need.

56:39.670 --> 56:43.150
Well, look, maybe next time
you should take your own advice.

56:43.150 --> 56:45.710
Don't touch anything
without gloves on.

56:45.710 --> 56:47.470
Touche.

56:47.470 --> 56:49.910
Bye, Simone. See you later.

58:01.270 --> 58:09.070
# Testator silens

58:10.830 --> 58:17.950
# Costestes e spiritu

58:17.950 --> 58:29.710
# Silencium... #

58:41.590 --> 58:44.350
Nikki Alexander.

58:45.870 --> 58:47.630
I'm sorry. It's a bad line.

58:49.990 --> 58:51.430
Can you say that again?

58:51.430 --> 58:53.190
It's Professor Sam Ryan, Nikki.

58:54.430 --> 58:56.550
I need your help.
