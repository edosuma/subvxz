WEBVTT

00:10.177 --> 00:11.761
My
story is no different.

00:11.761 --> 00:14.901
No more painful or
dramatic than what so many

00:14.901 --> 00:17.484
other women have to go through.

00:18.368 --> 00:21.145
See life is much, much more
than the magical dreams

00:21.145 --> 00:23.449
we have as children.

00:23.449 --> 00:26.193
It's a series of circumstances, events,

00:26.193 --> 00:29.876
and choices that we have
to make along the way.

00:29.876 --> 00:33.121
For me, everything I
thought I wanted was turned

00:33.121 --> 00:34.874
upside down.

00:34.874 --> 00:36.715
And now, I'm fightin' for my life.

00:36.715 --> 00:40.798
Instead of living the
dream life that I imagined.

00:44.984 --> 00:48.183
It's six o'clock in the
mornin' and I have to get up.

00:48.183 --> 00:51.203
While the man I'm in love
with is knocked out cold.

00:51.203 --> 00:52.161
It's probably because we were

00:52.161 --> 00:54.183
up half the night makin' love.

00:54.183 --> 00:56.141
Although today's my birthday,

00:56.141 --> 00:57.826
he must've thought it was his, instead.

00:57.826 --> 01:00.844
Because we were at it all night long.

01:00.844 --> 01:02.407
Guess it's a man thing.

01:02.407 --> 01:04.154
I ain't mad at him.

01:04.154 --> 01:07.833
Sometimes I think men
get a little confused

01:07.833 --> 01:11.002
by thinkin' that havin' sex
all night is the perfect gift

01:11.002 --> 01:12.919
that every woman wants.

01:21.790 --> 01:22.957
What the fuck?

01:24.026 --> 01:24.859
Charles.

01:28.597 --> 01:31.359
Charles, wake yo' ass up!

01:35.818 --> 01:37.203
Seriously?

01:37.203 --> 01:38.224
Charles, get up.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.326
Look at my chest!

01:43.167 --> 01:44.000
Look!

01:44.000 --> 01:45.182
Hm?

01:45.182 --> 01:47.426
- Ow, damn.
- What's wrong?

01:47.426 --> 01:49.145
Do you realize how
unprofessional this looks

01:49.145 --> 01:50.836
and you know I have to go to work?

01:50.836 --> 01:52.526
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:52.526 --> 01:53.618
Like, damn.

01:53.618 --> 01:54.451
I'm sorry.

01:54.451 --> 01:55.982
You know what you do to me
when you lyin' next to me-

01:55.982 --> 01:57.438
Are you crazy?

01:57.438 --> 01:59.331
Girl, you know you be
lookin' all tasty and thangs.

01:59.331 --> 02:02.291
Charles, I don't give
a damn how tasty I look.

02:02.291 --> 02:04.185
I've asked you not to do this.

02:04.185 --> 02:06.140
Okay, okay, I hear you.

02:06.140 --> 02:08.008
Just forgive me this one time.

02:08.008 --> 02:10.036
Naw, I'm not even in a
forgivin' mood right now.

02:10.036 --> 02:10.869
Calm down.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.077
I'm not tryin' to go
all day in the doghouse

02:12.077 --> 02:13.276
hearin' about this.

02:13.276 --> 02:14.913
Just forgive me this one last time.

02:14.913 --> 02:15.746
Can you look?

02:15.746 --> 02:17.079
Like, seriously.

02:19.781 --> 02:20.803
Ah, it's sore.
That hurt?

02:20.803 --> 02:22.329
Yes.

02:22.329 --> 02:24.227
Girl, I'll give you a birthday present.

02:25.490 --> 02:26.346
It is my birthday.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.699
Mm, it is your birthday.

02:29.532 --> 02:31.365
Happy birthday to you.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.061
Get this thing off.

02:35.061 --> 02:35.894
Dang it.

02:35.894 --> 02:36.727
Oh wait.

02:36.727 --> 02:38.393
No, no.
No what?

02:38.393 --> 02:39.476
Nina got school.

02:39.476 --> 02:40.687
What?

02:40.687 --> 02:41.520
She could wait.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.291
No, she gonna be late.

02:43.291 --> 02:44.320
Just two minutes, two minutes.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.548
Mm mm, no 'cause two
minutes turn into 20 minutes.

02:47.381 --> 02:48.214
You need to get up, too!

02:48.214 --> 02:49.047
I'm gettin' up.

02:49.047 --> 02:50.318
I'ma get up in a second.

02:50.318 --> 02:52.101
I know you up, but you
need to get up, like-

02:52.101 --> 02:52.934
Yeah, I'm up.

02:52.934 --> 02:53.963
I'm up.

02:53.963 --> 02:55.612
Okay, just save that for later.

02:55.612 --> 02:56.781
I'm gonna make
it up to ya, too, all right?

02:56.781 --> 02:57.614
I know you will.

02:57.614 --> 02:58.456
I'm sorry about that.

03:00.110 --> 03:01.382
My
daughter is the best thing

03:01.382 --> 03:03.319
that ever happened to me.

03:03.319 --> 03:05.459
But it did come at a price.

03:05.459 --> 03:06.376
Heartbreak.

03:07.738 --> 03:09.532
That's what happens when you fall in love

03:09.532 --> 03:12.789
with the smooth-talkin',
tall, chocolate man

03:12.789 --> 03:16.543
who just so happens to be
married and lies about it.

03:16.543 --> 03:18.502
Guess I shoulda paid more
attention to the warning signs,

03:18.502 --> 03:20.585
but I was young and dumb.

03:21.531 --> 03:22.364
Oh well.

03:22.364 --> 03:23.543
I love my daughter.

03:23.543 --> 03:26.626
So all is well that ends well, right?

03:27.902 --> 03:28.735
Nina.

03:30.238 --> 03:31.571
Time to wake up.

03:32.608 --> 03:35.282
I know you up already.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.115
Come on.

03:36.115 --> 03:38.532
Time to get ready for school.

03:42.495 --> 03:44.301
Do you know what day it is?

03:44.301 --> 03:46.404
Yup, school day.

03:46.404 --> 03:47.362
No.

03:47.362 --> 03:48.700

03:48.700 --> 03:50.096

Happy birthday, Mommy.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.546
Oh, I love when you sing to me.

04:02.546 --> 04:05.371
So, I'm goin' out with friends tonight.

04:05.371 --> 04:07.463
So, I gotta call Aunt Renee and see if she

04:07.463 --> 04:09.091
can watch you.

04:09.091 --> 04:09.924
But we'll celebrate-

04:10.821 --> 04:11.848
Don't do that.

04:11.848 --> 04:14.242
But we'll celebrate when I get back.

04:14.242 --> 04:15.320
I promise.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.247
Cake and ice cream?

04:16.247 --> 04:17.079
Yes.

04:17.079 --> 04:17.913
Cake and ice cream.

04:17.913 --> 04:18.745
As much as you want.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.058
Is Nina
gettin' ready for school?

04:35.058 --> 04:35.905
Yeah.

04:35.905 --> 04:37.322
Okay.

04:40.564 --> 04:41.588
Babe.

04:41.588 --> 04:43.167
What's up, baby?

04:43.167 --> 04:45.058
I got in law school.

04:45.058 --> 04:45.891
What?

04:45.891 --> 04:46.724
Stop playin'.

04:46.724 --> 04:48.368
For real, read it.

04:51.080 --> 04:51.980
What?

04:51.980 --> 04:52.813
Baby!
Yes!

04:52.813 --> 04:53.646
Congratulations.

04:53.646 --> 04:54.705
You got into law school.

04:54.705 --> 04:55.989
Yes.

04:56.851 --> 04:58.271
Wow.

04:58.271 --> 04:59.459
Mm.

04:59.459 --> 05:00.534
You're in it now.

05:00.534 --> 05:03.624
Maybe I should go back to school.

05:03.624 --> 05:04.720
- You should.
- Yeah.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.303
I'm thinkin' about it.

05:06.303 --> 05:08.195
What you gonna go for?

05:08.195 --> 05:09.526
I can become a doctor.

05:09.526 --> 05:10.359
A doctor?

05:10.359 --> 05:11.498
Yeah, you know.

05:11.498 --> 05:12.342
Hm.

05:12.342 --> 05:13.175
Mm.

05:13.175 --> 05:14.620
Yeah.

05:14.620 --> 05:16.635
Dr. Charles White.

05:16.635 --> 05:17.686
Chief surgeon.

05:17.686 --> 05:18.700
Oh, you goin' for the gold.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.040
Yeah, I like how that sounds.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.186
I like the sound of that, too.

05:21.186 --> 05:22.154
You like that?

05:22.154 --> 05:22.987
You know what?

05:22.987 --> 05:24.128
I can be your first patient.

05:24.128 --> 05:25.594
Oh, really?

05:26.427 --> 05:27.980
You can fix all these damn
bite marks you put on me

05:27.980 --> 05:28.813
last night.

05:28.813 --> 05:30.396
I'll take care of your bite marks.

05:30.396 --> 05:31.830
We're gonna be a house
full of professionals.

05:31.830 --> 05:32.663
Yup.

05:33.496 --> 05:34.779
We gon' get paid, huh?

05:34.779 --> 05:36.112
Givin' it up.

05:36.112 --> 05:37.226
You and this we.

05:37.226 --> 05:38.059
Yeah, we.

05:38.059 --> 05:38.892
We.

05:38.892 --> 05:39.848
I'm gonna get paid.

05:39.848 --> 05:41.238
We are gonna get paid.

05:41.238 --> 05:43.827
And you gon' work on
goin' to medical school.

05:43.827 --> 05:44.874
That too.

05:44.874 --> 05:49.502
But in the meantime, we,
since this is our household.

05:49.502 --> 05:50.657
You know, we are goin' to get paid.

05:50.657 --> 05:51.490
Okay.

05:51.490 --> 05:53.634
A house full of professionals.

05:53.634 --> 05:54.847
Gettin' paid all the big bucks, too.

05:54.847 --> 05:56.328
Mm hm.

05:56.328 --> 05:57.194
What you think?

05:57.194 --> 05:58.701
I think we make a great team.

05:58.701 --> 05:59.875
I think so too.

05:59.875 --> 06:01.805
Two good-lookin' professionals.

06:01.805 --> 06:02.638
Exactly.

06:03.471 --> 06:05.062
Nina, are you ready?

06:05.062 --> 06:06.895
Hey, Nina.

06:07.875 --> 06:09.708
Y'all have a good day.

06:11.535 --> 06:13.375
She got into law school.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.134
Tired of sellin' these cars.

06:16.134 --> 06:17.442
My Aunt Rene.

06:17.442 --> 06:19.293
I don't know what I would do without her.

06:19.293 --> 06:22.641
She's been, really, the
only mother I've known.

06:22.641 --> 06:24.126
She can be really strict, though.

06:24.126 --> 06:26.576
I know I let her down once
by gettin' pregnant, but,

06:26.576 --> 06:29.522
even so, she's always been there for me.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.892
I kinda think I'm the reason
why she never got married.

06:31.892 --> 06:35.122
She was so busy tryin' to
build her salon and raise me,

06:35.122 --> 06:36.961
she put men on the back burner.

06:36.961 --> 06:40.508
Well, it may be because she's
kinda mean and bossy, too.

06:40.508 --> 06:42.341
But I love her anyway.

06:43.474 --> 06:45.799
Good morning, Auntie.

06:45.799 --> 06:47.942
Good morning, Leslie.

06:47.942 --> 06:49.101
How are you today?

06:49.101 --> 06:50.934
I'm doin' just fine.

06:51.894 --> 06:52.852
Happy birthday.

06:52.852 --> 06:55.765
Thank you.

06:55.765 --> 07:00.201
I can't believe I'm 28 already.

07:00.201 --> 07:01.733
Time is really flyin' by.

07:01.733 --> 07:03.828
I remember you used to always tell me,

07:03.828 --> 07:07.366
"Leslie, time flies by
faster than you can keep up."

07:08.650 --> 07:11.839
But, I realize how true that is now.

07:12.913 --> 07:14.993
I have a huge favor to ax you, though.

07:14.993 --> 07:16.986
And I know it's last minute and
you hate when I ax you stuff

07:16.986 --> 07:21.452
last minute, but, can you
keep Nina this weekend?

07:21.452 --> 07:22.947
Oh, of course I can.

07:22.947 --> 07:24.667
I had already planned on doin' just that.

07:24.667 --> 07:26.093
Yes.

07:26.093 --> 07:28.048
I mean, it's your birthday weekend.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.722
Ah, you know me
better than I know myself.

07:30.722 --> 07:32.921
That's why I love you so, so much.

07:32.921 --> 07:34.030
I love you too.

07:36.377 --> 07:38.603
I have somethin' else too.

07:38.603 --> 07:40.741
Why're you givin' me that look?

07:40.741 --> 07:42.082
Just read it.

07:42.082 --> 07:43.787
And you're welcome.

07:43.787 --> 07:45.537
Thank you.

07:52.319 --> 07:53.152
Leslie.

07:54.293 --> 07:55.550
You got into law school?

07:55.550 --> 07:57.992
Yes.

07:57.992 --> 08:01.325
I am so proud of you.

08:01.325 --> 08:02.158
This is great.

08:02.158 --> 08:03.416
Thank you.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.639
Although, I'm not surprised.

08:05.639 --> 08:07.556
I knew you would do it.

08:08.426 --> 08:10.857
I been studyin' so hard.

08:10.857 --> 08:12.619
It's finally payin' off.

08:12.619 --> 08:15.391
But, I know the real work starts now.

08:15.391 --> 08:16.824
Yeah, that is true.

08:16.824 --> 08:18.540
But I have nothin' but
confidence that you'll finish

08:18.540 --> 08:20.123
with flyin' colors.

08:21.788 --> 08:25.621
You know, this is a
special time in your life.

08:26.820 --> 08:31.320
And special moments have to
be enjoyed like fine wine.

08:32.322 --> 08:36.014
You don't just gobble it
down like a glass of water.

08:36.014 --> 08:38.575
So, go out and celebrate this weekend.

08:38.575 --> 08:39.408
Relax.

08:40.462 --> 08:41.917
And have fun.

08:41.917 --> 08:42.750
You earned it.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.992
Oh, you know I will.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.465
Can't wait to celebrate.

08:46.465 --> 08:48.949
It's like all I do is
go to work and school.

08:48.949 --> 08:50.950
School and work.

08:50.950 --> 08:52.555
- Hey, Leslie.
- Trina?

08:52.555 --> 08:54.514
Happy birthday!

08:54.514 --> 08:56.302
Thank you.

08:56.302 --> 08:59.017
I'm so sorry I can't make it
to your birthday celebration.

08:59.017 --> 09:02.668
Aw, well you know it's all good.

09:02.668 --> 09:03.737
Man, we need to catch up.

09:03.737 --> 09:05.660
Oh, it's been so long.

09:05.660 --> 09:06.638
So, how are you?

09:06.638 --> 09:08.326
Oh, busy as ever.

09:08.326 --> 09:09.493
Just like you.

09:10.354 --> 09:11.721
But I'm good.

09:11.721 --> 09:13.000

09:21.077 --> 09:22.742
It's like everything's

09:24.133 --> 09:25.183
I'm so happy for you.

09:25.183 --> 09:26.469
Thank you.

09:26.469 --> 09:28.199
You have got to call
me when you have time

09:28.199 --> 09:29.456

09:29.456 --> 09:30.289
Oh, I know.

09:30.289 --> 09:31.286

09:31.286 --> 09:32.119
So, what about you?

09:32.119 --> 09:34.501

Okay, I'm really gon' call you.

I'd love to meet him.

09:45.859 --> 09:48.712
I just wanna make sure he
really is the one this time.

09:48.712 --> 09:51.349
Oh, I hear you on that.

09:51.349 --> 09:53.313
And it's all good you
can't make it to my party.

09:53.313 --> 09:55.014
I know Aunt Rene said you have a show.

09:55.014 --> 09:56.722
That's good.

09:56.722 --> 09:57.803
Drink one for me.

09:57.803 --> 09:59.984
Oh, you know I will.

09:59.984 --> 10:02.488
Okay, party girls.

10:02.488 --> 10:04.925
Get out of here and go to
work, before you're late.

10:04.925 --> 10:05.758
All right.

10:05.758 --> 10:06.906
We 'bout to get ready to open up.

10:06.906 --> 10:07.821
Love you, Auntie.

10:07.821 --> 10:08.866
Thank you.

10:08.866 --> 10:10.637
Y'all have a good day.

10:15.943 --> 10:17.958
Then
there's my girl, Belinda.

10:17.958 --> 10:20.316
She always got my back and I got hers.

10:20.316 --> 10:22.081
I tell her everything.

10:22.081 --> 10:24.242
Well, almost everything.

10:24.242 --> 10:25.792
Everyone needs someone to talk to.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.359
Especially about those
things that you don't want

10:27.359 --> 10:29.986
everyone to know about.

10:35.319 --> 10:36.666
Hello, Miss Jackson.

10:36.666 --> 10:37.999
How you doin'?

10:45.154 --> 10:46.792
Good morning.

Okay, but first,

11:15.108 --> 11:16.208

Go ahead.

11:16.208 --> 11:17.643

11:25.823 --> 11:27.787
I needed this.

11:27.787 --> 11:29.717
Girl, this ain't no high fashion scarf.

11:29.717 --> 11:30.550
It's cute, though.

11:30.550 --> 11:32.225
I like that.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.906
No, I'm coverin' up.

11:33.906 --> 11:35.556
Look.
Coverin' what?

11:35.556 --> 11:37.161

11:37.161 --> 11:38.065
Damn.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.071
What was y'all doin' last night?

11:41.071 --> 11:42.654
Girl, I woke up this mornin'

11:42.654 --> 11:44.967
with all these bite marks on me.

11:44.967 --> 11:48.124
Like, I kept askin' him to stop.

11:48.124 --> 11:48.971
Stop what?

11:48.971 --> 11:49.804
Biting?

11:49.804 --> 11:50.637
Yes.

11:50.637 --> 11:51.808
He got a big mouth.

11:51.808 --> 11:52.694
And they sore as he-

11:52.694 --> 11:53.527
Ow, girl!

11:53.527 --> 11:54.485

11:54.485 --> 11:55.473

11:55.473 --> 11:58.289
They sore as hell, like.

11:58.289 --> 11:59.122
Y'all nasty.

11:59.955 --> 12:00.788
Shut up.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.799
I mean, the rest was good, you know.

12:02.799 --> 12:06.004
I don't know what's
wrong with all men, like.

12:06.004 --> 12:07.577
They think it's all about them.

12:07.577 --> 12:09.163
Like, it's not about you?

12:09.163 --> 12:11.387
How would you feel if my
dog chewed on your butt?

12:12.507 --> 12:13.340
You know?

12:13.340 --> 12:14.590
Girl, you know what?

12:14.590 --> 12:15.579
You ain't lyin'.

12:15.579 --> 12:18.635
Like, how would he feel
bein' chewed on all night

12:18.635 --> 12:19.923
like a piece of steak?

12:19.923 --> 12:20.756
Yeah.

12:20.756 --> 12:21.877
Uh uh.

12:21.877 --> 12:23.171
What, why you all giddy?

12:24.004 --> 12:25.087
What is this?

12:26.179 --> 12:27.012
Oh my God.

12:30.063 --> 12:31.113
You got into law school?

12:31.113 --> 12:32.696
Yes!

12:32.696 --> 12:33.529
What?

12:33.529 --> 12:34.362
Finally.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.167
Oh my God, like what a birthday.

12:37.000 --> 12:37.833
Okay.

12:39.674 --> 12:41.221
You got into law school.

12:41.221 --> 12:42.948
All them night classes.

12:42.948 --> 12:44.370
Long hours studying.

12:45.203 --> 12:47.396
Finally payin' off.

12:47.396 --> 12:48.812
I'm so happy.

12:48.812 --> 12:49.905
What are we gonna do to celebrate?

12:49.905 --> 12:53.462
Like, I mean, it's Friday,
it's your birthday,

12:53.462 --> 12:55.855
you ain't got no job.

12:55.855 --> 12:57.401
Like, what's the plan?

12:57.401 --> 12:58.234
You stupid.

12:58.234 --> 12:59.447
What we doin' tonight?

12:59.447 --> 13:01.258
I'm gonna party and celebrate.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.591
Hey.
Okay.

13:02.591 --> 13:03.893
What we doin'?

13:03.893 --> 13:04.726
I don't know.

13:04.726 --> 13:06.516
Charles said he knew about
this little place or whatever.

13:06.516 --> 13:07.778
It's supposed to be
like a cute little spot.

13:08.611 --> 13:09.444
Yeah, Charles.

13:09.444 --> 13:10.998
When he tell me, I'm
gonna text you the address.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.042
And I know you're gonna
bring some little boo thang.

13:13.042 --> 13:13.875
I know how you do.

13:14.911 --> 13:16.570
Just don't bring old boy from last time.

13:16.570 --> 13:17.403
Look.

13:17.403 --> 13:18.883
Don't do me like that.

13:18.883 --> 13:21.269
My guy is better than your guy, okay?

13:21.269 --> 13:22.102
Here we go.

13:22.102 --> 13:22.935
Don't start.

13:22.935 --> 13:23.768
But, you know what?

13:23.768 --> 13:25.598
I'm just so proud of you.

13:25.598 --> 13:26.431
Thank you.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.768
Like, I really admire you.

13:28.768 --> 13:33.301
You set your goals just
so high to do everything.

13:33.301 --> 13:34.876
I mean, now look.

13:35.709 --> 13:36.876
I know, man.

13:38.783 --> 13:41.694
This is like the best birthday ever.

13:41.694 --> 13:42.861
I bet it is.

13:43.825 --> 13:46.528
Can't wait for tonight.

14:07.753 --> 14:08.711
I would like to make a toast.

14:08.711 --> 14:11.794
To the best future lawyer
that money can buy.

14:11.794 --> 14:13.509
A very happy birthday.

14:13.509 --> 14:14.926
I love you, babe.

14:16.738 --> 14:20.374
You guys, I'm so
grateful y'all are here.

14:20.374 --> 14:21.624
I love you all.

14:22.670 --> 14:24.575
This is such a very special moment for me

14:24.575 --> 14:26.811
and I'm so glad y'all could make it.

14:27.913 --> 14:29.576
Now, let's turn up.

14:29.576 --> 14:31.745
Hold on, one second.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.307
So, what's next?

14:33.307 --> 14:35.194
So, we just
got law school, right?

14:35.194 --> 14:37.474
No, are there wedding bells in the air?

14:38.975 --> 14:40.308
No, don't choke!

14:41.889 --> 14:44.654
It's been awhile since
we talked about marriage.

14:44.654 --> 14:45.487
Okay.

14:45.487 --> 14:46.853
They ain't talked about it?

14:46.853 --> 14:49.695
Yeah, you been so
concerned, so stressed out,

14:49.695 --> 14:50.936
about getting into law school.

14:50.936 --> 14:52.569
That's finally happened.

14:52.569 --> 14:53.569
But, soon?

14:54.593 --> 14:57.347
Well, the car sellin'
business is startin' to pick up.

14:57.347 --> 14:58.180
So, we have more time-

14:58.180 --> 15:00.656
So we can go
wedding dress shopping?

15:03.975 --> 15:04.808
We talked about that.

15:04.808 --> 15:05.999
I thought you trusted me.

15:05.999 --> 15:07.365
It takes time.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.198
But, how-

15:08.198 --> 15:09.031
You trust me, right?

15:09.031 --> 15:09.987
Much time you need?

15:09.987 --> 15:11.067
Do you trust me?

15:11.067 --> 15:12.539
'Cause I'm older.

15:12.539 --> 15:13.886
But do you trust me?

15:13.886 --> 15:14.969
I trust you, babe.

15:14.969 --> 15:18.048
All these excuses.

15:18.048 --> 15:19.978
Tonight about
where we are right now

15:19.978 --> 15:21.191
in the moment.

15:21.191 --> 15:22.730
Not where we're goin' to be.

15:22.730 --> 15:24.281
Good things come to those who wait.

15:24.281 --> 15:25.852
At least that's what I was told.

15:26.685 --> 15:27.518
Can we get menus?

15:27.518 --> 15:29.101
For food?

15:29.101 --> 15:29.934
Are you ready to eat?

15:29.934 --> 15:30.767
Ready to eat?

15:30.767 --> 15:33.101
I'm ready to eat, but
I'm also ready for...

15:33.101 --> 15:34.569
Okay, okay.

15:34.569 --> 15:35.986
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:02.990 --> 16:03.823
So you good?

16:03.823 --> 16:04.656
I'm good.

16:04.656 --> 16:06.185
'Cause the real party's gonna start now.

16:06.185 --> 16:07.410
You said the real party about to start.

16:08.681 --> 16:10.306
All right, help me get out this.

16:10.306 --> 16:13.139
Oh, I got you on that.

16:14.821 --> 16:15.797
You're so sexy.

16:15.797 --> 16:17.121
I'll be right back.

16:17.121 --> 16:18.236
Be right back?

16:18.236 --> 16:19.148
I'll be right back.

16:19.148 --> 16:20.514
Where you goin'?

16:20.514 --> 16:21.369
I'm comin' right back.

16:21.369 --> 16:22.446
Yeah, but, come on.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.163
Where you goin'?

16:24.163 --> 16:25.461
I got a surprise for you.

16:25.461 --> 16:26.294
I'll be right back.

16:26.294 --> 16:27.394
I got a surprise for you too.

16:36.703 --> 16:37.536
Oh, hello.

16:39.642 --> 16:41.703
Happy birthday, counselor.

16:41.703 --> 16:43.953
Oh you got a drink ready?

16:46.188 --> 16:47.754
Oh.

16:47.754 --> 16:49.004
That is strong.

16:49.852 --> 16:51.477
You like it strong.

16:51.477 --> 16:52.310
Well.

16:52.310 --> 16:53.444
You like this
tall, strong thing, don't you?

16:53.444 --> 16:54.277
Mm hm.

16:54.277 --> 16:55.110
What's up, girl?

16:55.110 --> 16:56.045
You know I love you, right?

16:56.045 --> 16:57.028
Oh yeah, you love me?

16:57.028 --> 16:59.704
- Mm hm.
- What you love about me?

16:59.704 --> 17:00.537
That handsome face.

17:00.537 --> 17:02.117
Mm, what else?

17:02.117 --> 17:04.573
That boyish smile.

17:04.573 --> 17:05.782
Everything about you.

17:05.782 --> 17:06.839
You just like the fact
that you can get a car

17:06.839 --> 17:08.425
whenever you want to.

17:08.425 --> 17:09.259
I do like my car.

17:09.259 --> 17:11.609
There you go.

17:11.609 --> 17:12.775
I like this too.

17:12.775 --> 17:14.916
Oh, you like that long boy.

17:14.916 --> 17:16.718
Yeah, I like that.

17:18.294 --> 17:19.529
I just want
you to know that there is

17:19.529 --> 17:22.415
no other place in this world
that I'd rather be with you.

17:24.305 --> 17:26.457
You know I'ma hold
you to every word of that.

17:26.457 --> 17:27.488
Hold me to that?

17:27.488 --> 17:29.459
Mm hm.

17:29.459 --> 17:30.834
I'll be guilty as charged for loving you

17:30.834 --> 17:32.834
for the rest of my life.

17:38.493 --> 17:40.636
This
was that magical time for me.

17:40.636 --> 17:42.373
Everything I though I
ever wanted in my life

17:42.373 --> 17:44.432
is goin' my way.

17:44.432 --> 17:46.200
Or at least that's how it seemed.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.005
Being young can make you feel invincible.

17:49.005 --> 17:51.279
Like nothin' can stop
you or get in your way.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.355
You can handle anything and
everything that comes along

17:53.355 --> 17:55.772
and tries to get in your way.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.160
Oo, this food looks good.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.255
Damn.

19:21.255 --> 19:24.185
Babe, when I tell you,
this food is the bomb.

19:24.185 --> 19:25.117
For real?

19:25.117 --> 19:26.882
Like, this was me and
Auntie Rene favorite place.

19:26.882 --> 19:29.318
She used to bring me here
every week growin' up.

19:29.318 --> 19:30.699
Now, wait, what's your favorite?

19:30.699 --> 19:31.694
Them black eyed peas.

19:31.694 --> 19:32.527
Who?

19:32.527 --> 19:33.360
Them black eyed peas.

19:33.360 --> 19:34.193
What black eyed peas?

19:34.193 --> 19:35.265
Boy, you're gonna give me
some of them black eyed peas.

19:35.265 --> 19:36.594
Ah, man, you shoulda got
your own black eyed peas.

19:36.594 --> 19:37.427
Not-

19:37.427 --> 19:38.260
Babe-

19:38.260 --> 19:39.176
Charles, before you-

19:39.176 --> 19:40.049
Let me get the first bite.

19:40.882 --> 19:41.715
Ah, come on.

19:41.715 --> 19:42.548
Here you are, here you are.

19:42.548 --> 19:43.705
I gotcha, I gotcha.

19:45.621 --> 19:47.857
You did that on purpose.

19:47.857 --> 19:49.158
Hold on, I gotcha, I gotcha.

19:49.158 --> 19:51.405
Let me get it for ya.

19:51.405 --> 19:52.291
Ow.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.124
You all right?

19:53.124 --> 19:54.019
Yeah.

19:54.019 --> 19:55.725
- You sure?
- Yeah.

19:55.725 --> 19:56.558
Okay.

19:59.070 --> 20:01.975
Man, babe, this brings
back so many memories.

20:01.975 --> 20:04.263
You're really makin' this weekend special.

20:04.263 --> 20:05.636
I do a little somethin' sometimes.

20:05.636 --> 20:06.961
You know I'm not lettin' you go, right?

20:06.961 --> 20:08.086
- You're not?
- No.

20:08.086 --> 20:09.858
Like, you in this for the long-haul.

20:09.858 --> 20:11.071
You just want another car.

20:12.271 --> 20:14.052
I do really love my car.

20:14.052 --> 20:16.372
And that extended warranty
pretty damn good, too.

20:16.372 --> 20:18.703
Ah, well I'll tell
you this much, though.

20:18.703 --> 20:19.956
Mm hm?

20:19.956 --> 20:22.641
I'm in this for the long-haul.

20:22.641 --> 20:24.124
But, as far as that car.

20:24.124 --> 20:25.810
That car has a limited warranty.

20:25.810 --> 20:28.137
See, I come with a lifetime guarantee.

20:28.137 --> 20:29.196
You ain't gotta take me to the shop,

20:29.196 --> 20:30.091
get me no repairs.

20:30.091 --> 20:31.792
And, get all that money from me.

20:31.792 --> 20:34.808
Just put some gas in the
tank and keep me goin'.

20:34.808 --> 20:37.131
Well, you know I'll believe
all that when I see a ring

20:37.131 --> 20:38.236
on this finger.

20:38.236 --> 20:39.194
This one.

20:39.194 --> 20:40.027
See how cute?

20:40.027 --> 20:41.782
It's just missin' that one thing.

20:42.615 --> 20:43.448
That one thing.

20:43.448 --> 20:44.316
Okay, okay, okay.

20:44.316 --> 20:45.950
I'll tell you what.

20:45.950 --> 20:46.783
I'll step my game up.

20:46.783 --> 20:47.616
- Okay.
- I got you.

20:47.616 --> 20:48.805
Just trust me.

20:48.805 --> 20:49.847
You trust me?

20:49.847 --> 20:50.680
I trust you.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.888
- You sure?
- I trust you.

20:51.888 --> 20:52.860
I'ma take care of it.

20:52.860 --> 20:53.693
Mm hm.

20:55.771 --> 20:57.607
Let me get some more of your
black eyed peas, though.

20:57.607 --> 20:58.440
What?

20:58.440 --> 20:59.887
Let me get some oxtail right there.

20:59.887 --> 21:00.720
All right.

21:00.720 --> 21:01.553
Which one?

21:01.553 --> 21:02.678
Let me get this big one right here.

21:02.678 --> 21:03.817
Why you gotta take the big one, though?

21:03.817 --> 21:05.375
'Cause you're not gonna eat it all.

21:05.375 --> 21:06.444
How you gonna tell me what I'ma eat?

21:06.444 --> 21:07.277
'Cause you-

21:07.277 --> 21:08.485
I brought you here.

21:09.318 --> 21:10.151
I put you on.

21:12.535 --> 21:13.724
So here's
where the problems start

21:13.724 --> 21:14.715
to happen.

21:14.715 --> 21:16.434
I haven't been to the doctor in years.

21:16.434 --> 21:18.341
I'm never sick and,
besides, I don't really have

21:18.341 --> 21:19.879
good medical insurance.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.096
My deductible is really
high, so I can't afford

21:22.096 --> 21:23.259
to really get sick.

21:23.259 --> 21:26.665
But, now, I think
somethin' might be wrong.

21:26.665 --> 21:28.647
My breasts are still sore.

21:28.647 --> 21:29.836
More than usual.

21:29.836 --> 21:31.859
Leslie Brown,
we're ready for you.

21:31.859 --> 21:33.057
I'm concerned.

21:33.057 --> 21:35.074
Okay, Miss Brown, I'm
gonna take your vitals

21:35.074 --> 21:36.746
and get some information from you.

21:36.746 --> 21:37.579
Okay.

21:37.579 --> 21:40.513
And, shortly after that,
the doctor will be in, okay?

21:45.828 --> 21:47.995
Under your tongue, please.

21:49.799 --> 21:50.632
98.2.

21:53.281 --> 21:55.488
Have you eaten or drank
anything this morning?

21:55.488 --> 21:57.889
No, not since last night.

21:57.889 --> 21:59.041
All right then.

21:59.041 --> 22:00.247
The doctor will be in shortly, okay?

22:00.247 --> 22:01.080
Okay.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.571
Thank you.

22:40.231 --> 22:41.638
Well, hello, Leslie.

22:41.638 --> 22:42.471
Hey, Dr. Westbrook.

22:42.471 --> 22:44.665
Been a while since I've seen you.

22:44.665 --> 22:46.013
What brings you in here today?

22:46.013 --> 22:50.324
So, my boyfriend been
bitin' me up a bit.

22:50.324 --> 22:51.300
Mm hm.

22:51.300 --> 22:55.410
So my breasts are just a
little more sore than usual.

22:55.410 --> 22:57.514
So I thought I'd just come
in and get 'em checked out.

22:57.514 --> 22:58.347
Okay.

22:58.347 --> 23:03.012
But, on a lighter note, you're
lookin' at a future lawyer.

23:03.012 --> 23:04.502
I got into law school finally.

23:04.502 --> 23:05.989
All right, well congratulations.

23:05.989 --> 23:07.741
You must be very proud of yourself.

23:07.741 --> 23:08.574
Yes.

23:08.574 --> 23:09.971
That's
quite an accomplishment.

23:09.971 --> 23:10.804
Yes.

23:10.804 --> 23:12.674
I worked long and hard to get in.

23:12.674 --> 23:14.587
So, this is my time.

23:14.587 --> 23:16.509
I know how that is.

23:16.509 --> 23:17.590
All right.

23:17.590 --> 23:20.259
So, what I'm gonna do is.

23:20.259 --> 23:21.217
I'm gonna take a look real quick.

23:21.217 --> 23:24.799
Gonna get you to kinda
open up your gown here.

23:24.799 --> 23:28.067
Yeah, see these bite marks
are just gettin' outta hand.

23:28.067 --> 23:30.645
Oo, looks like he got you pretty good.

23:30.645 --> 23:31.478
Yeah.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.245
Have one of those men
who think my breast area

23:33.245 --> 23:35.122
is a happy feeding ground.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.757
Well, that can be a problem in some men.

23:37.757 --> 23:39.736
Especially when they haven't
been weaned from their

23:39.736 --> 23:41.661
mother's breast milk.

23:43.292 --> 23:44.398
You know what?

23:44.398 --> 23:47.520
Now that I think about
it, that explains a lot.

23:47.520 --> 23:48.353
Mommy issues.

23:49.186 --> 23:50.708
Mm.

23:50.708 --> 23:52.666
Yeah that kinda hurt.

23:52.666 --> 23:55.641
How long have you been
experiencing this soreness?

23:55.641 --> 23:59.262
Well, I'm normally sore,
like, right before my cycle.

23:59.262 --> 24:01.509
But this type of soreness?

24:01.509 --> 24:03.031
Maybe a couple months.

24:03.031 --> 24:05.907
It's like it just won't go away.

24:05.907 --> 24:06.889
Okay.

24:06.889 --> 24:09.271
Do you think it's from him biting on you?

24:09.271 --> 24:10.104
Yeah.

24:10.104 --> 24:12.699
I mean, I'm pretty sure that's what it is.

24:12.699 --> 24:16.077
If the soreness can go away,
I'll be all right, right?

24:16.077 --> 24:17.722
I don't
think it's from that.

24:17.722 --> 24:19.346
But I'm glad you came in so we can get

24:19.346 --> 24:21.687
to the bottom of this.

24:21.687 --> 24:23.684
I'm gonna go ahead and
schedule you for a mammogram

24:23.684 --> 24:25.342
as soon as possible.

24:25.342 --> 24:26.753
Really?

24:26.753 --> 24:29.003
What do you think is wrong?

24:30.611 --> 24:33.278
Has anyone in your family
ever had breast cancer?

24:33.278 --> 24:34.552
Like, breast cancer, br-

24:34.552 --> 24:35.385
No.

24:36.598 --> 24:38.735
I don't think it's that.

24:38.735 --> 24:40.162
Nobody's in my family ever had that.

24:40.162 --> 24:41.091
No.

24:41.091 --> 24:41.924
It can't be that.

24:41.924 --> 24:42.757
I know I don't have breast cancer-

24:42.757 --> 24:44.708
Not jumping to any conclusions now.

24:44.708 --> 24:46.291
We're gonna run some tests and

24:46.291 --> 24:47.775
see if it comes back abnormal.

24:47.775 --> 24:51.746
But, right now, we need to
get you into a specialist.

24:51.746 --> 24:53.172
Dr. Westbrook.

24:53.172 --> 24:56.879
I'm 28 years old and you
just mentioned breast cancer.

24:56.879 --> 24:58.164
There's a
couple tests we're gonna run

24:58.164 --> 25:02.023
and we'll get the results
back and take it from there.

25:02.023 --> 25:04.797
But I'm gonna make sure that
before you leave here today,

25:04.797 --> 25:07.990
my office schedules you
to see a specialist.

25:07.990 --> 25:09.480
I don't think I have breast cancer, Doc.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.649
Ain't nobody in my family
ever had it either.

25:11.649 --> 25:12.638
I know.

25:12.638 --> 25:15.146
First things first, let's run the test,

25:15.146 --> 25:16.609
look at the results,

25:16.609 --> 25:17.598
and then we'll move forward.

25:17.598 --> 25:20.809
But I need to get you to
a specialist right away.

25:20.809 --> 25:21.690
All right.

25:21.690 --> 25:22.523
Take care.

25:22.523 --> 25:23.864
Yeah.

25:23.864 --> 25:24.751
Thanks.

25:24.751 --> 25:26.068
In the back of my mind,

25:26.068 --> 25:28.008
I knew somethin' was wrong.

25:28.008 --> 25:29.416
It's like I felt it.

25:29.416 --> 25:33.383
That numbness you get when
somethin's not quite right?

25:33.383 --> 25:36.765
I was afraid and startin' to worry.

25:36.765 --> 25:40.653
I also knew I wasn't gonna
say anything to anyone.

25:40.653 --> 25:43.569
For now, I decided to
keep it all to myself.

25:49.847 --> 25:50.680
Hello?

25:52.869 --> 25:53.702
Hi.

25:53.702 --> 25:55.119
Yes, this is she.

25:56.589 --> 25:57.422
Sure, sure.

25:57.422 --> 25:59.005
How can I help you?

26:04.337 --> 26:05.603
Okay.

26:05.603 --> 26:09.770
You can't just give me the
results over the phone?

26:12.840 --> 26:15.090
Is Dr. Westbrook there now?

26:18.190 --> 26:19.513
Okay, okay.

26:19.513 --> 26:23.296
Um, let me look at my calendar
and see when I'm available

26:23.296 --> 26:24.213
to come in.

26:28.948 --> 26:30.865
Okay, I have Wednesday.

26:34.155 --> 26:35.072
Sure, sure.

26:36.886 --> 26:37.719
Okay.

26:41.367 --> 26:42.200
Perfect.

26:44.202 --> 26:45.035
Okay.

26:46.088 --> 26:46.921
Thank you.

26:47.794 --> 26:48.627
Okay.

26:50.193 --> 26:51.026
Bye.

27:12.884 --> 27:15.152
Leslie,
I've gotten the results

27:15.152 --> 27:17.055
of your test back.

27:17.055 --> 27:20.189
I'm afraid that I have some bad news.

27:20.189 --> 27:22.881
The results show that you
have stage three breast cancer

27:22.881 --> 27:25.917
and I need to get you to
an oncologist right away.

27:25.917 --> 27:27.463
Stage three breast cancer?

27:27.463 --> 27:28.604
Yes.

27:28.604 --> 27:31.205
Dr. Westbrook, I'm too
young to have breast cancer.

27:31.205 --> 27:32.288
Are you sure?

27:33.499 --> 27:37.566
Trust me, but I'm confident,
according to these results,

27:37.566 --> 27:38.727
you have stage three breast cancer.

27:38.727 --> 27:40.072
Can I see?

27:40.072 --> 27:42.042
It's what we
refer to as a triple negative

27:42.042 --> 27:43.822
and we need to move quickly.

27:43.822 --> 27:44.655
Triple negative?

27:44.655 --> 27:46.500
Move quickly?

27:46.500 --> 27:47.333
No.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.166
Yes.

27:48.166 --> 27:48.999
This has to be a mistake.

27:48.999 --> 27:51.653
There's no way I have breast cancer.

27:51.653 --> 27:54.199
I need to be retested so I
can get a second opinion.

27:54.199 --> 27:55.032
This, no.

27:55.032 --> 27:57.323
Leslie, as your doctor, I advise you.

27:57.323 --> 28:00.031
You take this information seriously.

28:00.031 --> 28:00.864
No.

28:00.864 --> 28:02.626
No, I don't believe this.

28:02.626 --> 28:03.459
Listen to me.

28:03.459 --> 28:07.012
I strongly recommend that we move now.

28:07.012 --> 28:08.316
Please listen to me.

28:08.316 --> 28:10.829
I understand you're in denial.

28:10.829 --> 28:13.097
But you have stage three breast cancer.

28:13.097 --> 28:13.930
No, no.

28:13.930 --> 28:15.661
And we
do not have much time.

28:15.661 --> 28:17.716
I can have my office
schedule a referral for you

28:17.716 --> 28:19.830
before you leave for today.

28:19.830 --> 28:21.493
You don't understand.

28:21.493 --> 28:24.338
I don't need a referral, because
I don't have breast cancer.

28:24.338 --> 28:25.171
Yes, you do.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.443
There's no way this is right.

28:26.443 --> 28:27.276
That is yours.

28:27.276 --> 28:28.321
No, no.

28:28.321 --> 28:31.046
Listen to me, Leslie, this is real.

28:31.046 --> 28:31.879
You need-

28:31.879 --> 28:32.712
This is a mistake.

28:32.712 --> 28:34.442
You need to get something done now.

28:34.442 --> 28:36.453
Please listen to me.

28:36.453 --> 28:37.746
I will schedule a referral for you.

28:37.746 --> 28:38.579
No.

28:38.579 --> 28:40.269
Then we can start aggressive treatment.

28:40.269 --> 28:41.207
This is conclusive.

28:41.207 --> 28:42.341
There's no way this is real.

28:42.341 --> 28:44.535
This is
real and you are running

28:44.535 --> 28:46.118
out of time.

28:46.118 --> 28:46.951
No.

28:46.951 --> 28:47.837
You do not have time.

28:47.837 --> 28:48.670
Thank you.

28:48.670 --> 28:50.371
Please
take this serious, Leslie.

28:50.371 --> 28:51.587
I'll figure it out on my own.

28:51.587 --> 28:52.545
No, you can't.

28:52.545 --> 28:53.842
Please, Leslie, listen to me.

28:53.842 --> 28:54.675
Leslie!

29:02.398 --> 29:03.439
Aunt
Rene must've suspected

29:03.439 --> 29:06.527
somethin' was wrong when
I mentioned the mammogram.

29:06.527 --> 29:09.475
She didn't talk about her mother
or the rest of the family.

29:09.475 --> 29:11.057
That's just how it was.

29:11.057 --> 29:13.099
And since my mother was not in my life,

29:13.099 --> 29:15.439
I knew very little about her, either.

29:15.439 --> 29:18.044
Let alone our family's medical history.

29:18.044 --> 29:21.149
Family secrets never
end up in a good place.

29:35.636 --> 29:36.469
Hello.

29:39.480 --> 29:40.730
Hey, Aunt Rene.

29:43.162 --> 29:43.995
Yeah.

29:45.829 --> 29:46.662
Nothin'.

29:50.689 --> 29:53.439
Yeah, they found somethin' wrong.

29:54.829 --> 29:56.826
Listen, I can't talk about it right now.

29:56.826 --> 29:58.409
I'll call you back.

29:59.821 --> 30:01.866
I know, I know.

30:01.866 --> 30:04.283
I promise I'll call you back.

30:06.516 --> 30:08.004
Okay.

30:08.004 --> 30:08.837
Bye.

30:15.608 --> 30:16.858
Mommy?

30:17.894 --> 30:19.644
Oh, hi, sweetheart.

30:21.269 --> 30:22.604
What's up?

30:22.604 --> 30:24.355
You didn't wake me up for school.

30:24.355 --> 30:27.648
Does that mean I don't have to go?

30:27.648 --> 30:30.565
Oh, I just overslept, that's all.

30:33.595 --> 30:35.873
And, no, you don't have to go today.

30:35.873 --> 30:36.706
Really?

30:36.706 --> 30:37.842
Thank you.

30:37.842 --> 30:39.378
I didn't want to go today anyway.

30:39.378 --> 30:40.732
I bet.

30:40.732 --> 30:41.627
Then I can take care of you.

30:41.627 --> 30:44.208
Do you want some medicine or some cereal?

30:44.208 --> 30:47.291
No, I'm fine, it's just a headache.

30:49.876 --> 30:50.709
I'm fine.

30:51.965 --> 30:53.099
You still need some medicine.

30:53.099 --> 30:54.300
Let me go get it for you.

30:54.300 --> 30:56.742
Baby, it's just a headache.

30:56.742 --> 30:57.998
For real.

30:57.998 --> 31:00.209
I'll tell you what Mommy will do.

31:00.209 --> 31:01.911
I'll make us a big breakfast.

31:01.911 --> 31:02.744
Really?

31:02.744 --> 31:03.783
Really.

31:03.783 --> 31:05.116
So, go watch TV.

31:07.768 --> 31:08.601
Okay.

31:08.601 --> 31:11.022
I'll be down in a minute, okay?

31:45.601 --> 31:47.151
Triple.

31:47.151 --> 31:47.984
Negative.

31:49.190 --> 31:51.440
Breast cancer, stage three.

31:53.438 --> 31:58.438
Stage three means it has
invaded the body's lymph system.

31:58.951 --> 32:02.272
This is considered to be
at a very serious stage.

32:02.272 --> 32:03.105
Oh my God.

32:13.966 --> 32:17.485
It's Rene, open the door!

32:19.806 --> 32:20.889
I'm coming.

32:28.287 --> 32:31.457
I've been calling you all day.

32:31.457 --> 32:32.874
What is going on?

32:33.740 --> 32:35.636
I went to pick Nina up from
school and they told me

32:35.636 --> 32:37.303
she didn't go today.

32:38.522 --> 32:39.355
Where is she?

32:39.355 --> 32:40.272
Upstairs.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.030
So what's goin' on?

32:43.030 --> 32:44.644
Are you sick?

32:44.644 --> 32:45.973
I'm more than sick.

32:45.973 --> 32:47.887
So why didn't you call me?

32:47.887 --> 32:48.793
I overslept.

32:48.793 --> 32:49.626
I'm sorry.

32:52.138 --> 32:55.088
Look, I have some really bad news.

32:55.088 --> 32:57.952
Okay, so
what's the bad news?

32:57.952 --> 33:02.202
The doctor said I have
stage three breast cancer.

33:03.910 --> 33:05.709
Why is this happenin' to me?

33:05.709 --> 33:07.572
Leslie, are they sure?

33:07.572 --> 33:10.028
I guess.

33:10.028 --> 33:11.925
Tell me everything the
doctor said and don't leave

33:11.925 --> 33:13.541
anything out.

33:13.541 --> 33:15.105
I don't have much to tell you.

33:15.105 --> 33:19.334
I didn't stay long enough
to even hear it all.

33:19.334 --> 33:20.167
I left.

33:21.089 --> 33:24.467
All she said was I need
to see the specialist.

33:24.467 --> 33:25.300
That's it.

33:25.300 --> 33:28.105
I don't have anything else to tell you.

33:28.105 --> 33:30.888
Well, we're gonna get you a specialist.

33:30.888 --> 33:33.733
So we can find out
exactly what's goin' on.

33:35.449 --> 33:36.782
Don't be afraid.

33:38.738 --> 33:41.155
We're gonna get through this.

33:43.181 --> 33:45.059
Can I sleep now?

33:45.059 --> 33:47.476
I'm gonna go check on Nina.

33:53.841 --> 33:55.151
Hey, babe.

33:55.151 --> 33:56.918
Rene, how are you?

33:56.918 --> 33:59.952
I'm as
well as can be expected.

33:59.952 --> 34:00.880
What's wrong?

34:00.880 --> 34:01.713
You okay?

34:01.713 --> 34:02.951
Nothin' we need to talk

34:02.951 --> 34:04.775
about right now, Charles.

34:04.775 --> 34:06.275
I've been callin' you and callin'.

34:06.275 --> 34:07.282
You haven't answered your phone,

34:07.282 --> 34:09.717
returned none of my
text messages, nothin'.

34:09.717 --> 34:10.563
What's goin' on?

34:10.563 --> 34:12.422
I haven't felt like talkin'.

34:12.422 --> 34:13.255
What's botherin' you?

34:13.255 --> 34:14.088
You sick?

34:14.088 --> 34:14.920
You don't feel well?

34:14.920 --> 34:16.568
Nah, it's.

34:16.568 --> 34:18.435
I don't wanna talk about it right now.

34:18.435 --> 34:19.777
I'll call you later.

34:19.777 --> 34:22.467
You'll call me later?

34:22.467 --> 34:24.244
I just drove over here to check on you,

34:24.244 --> 34:25.491
because you haven't answered my calls,

34:25.491 --> 34:26.668
so tell me what's wrong.

34:26.668 --> 34:29.237
Because I
haven't felt like talking.

34:29.237 --> 34:30.071
Okay.

34:30.071 --> 34:31.380
I'm sorry for asking.

34:31.380 --> 34:32.947
I'm just trying to figure
out, you know, what's wrong

34:32.947 --> 34:33.781
with you.

34:33.781 --> 34:35.864
Look, I'm going through
something right now.

34:35.864 --> 34:37.697
I just need some time.

34:38.536 --> 34:40.004
I'm not tryin' to be rude, okay?

34:40.004 --> 34:41.463
Just gimme some time.

34:41.463 --> 34:43.129
I'll call you and tell you.

34:43.129 --> 34:44.915
Baby, I'm not tryin' to upset you.

34:44.915 --> 34:45.748
I'm just tryin' to
figure out what's wrong-

34:45.748 --> 34:48.565
Okay, but I don't feel like
talkin' about it right now.

34:51.089 --> 34:51.922
I don't understand what's going on.

34:51.922 --> 34:53.553
It's like everybody's
acting weird around here.

34:53.553 --> 34:54.451
Nobody's telling me nothing.

34:54.451 --> 34:55.482
It's like ever-

34:56.440 --> 34:59.926
Nobody's understanding
I just want to rest.

34:59.926 --> 35:02.950
I will talk to my aunt
when I talk to the doctor.

35:02.950 --> 35:05.291
I will talk to you when
I'm ready to talk about it.

35:05.291 --> 35:06.746
What's with the attitude?

35:06.746 --> 35:09.222
Because you keep
askin' me all these questions.

35:09.222 --> 35:10.555
And I keep tellin' you I
don't feel like talkin'

35:10.555 --> 35:11.452
about it.

35:11.452 --> 35:13.048
Sorry.

35:13.048 --> 35:15.298
I'm just concerned, I mean.

35:18.509 --> 35:21.013
She says she doesn't
wanna talk right now.

35:21.013 --> 35:23.898
So why don't you give her a little space?

35:23.898 --> 35:26.385
Now, I'm sure she'll talk about
what's bothering her later.

35:26.385 --> 35:28.587
When she gets herself together.

35:28.587 --> 35:32.171
Okay, fine, I'll just go
upstairs and, if you need me,

35:32.171 --> 35:33.004
I'll be in the room.

35:33.004 --> 35:34.706
You can go home.

35:34.706 --> 35:35.539
Go home?

35:36.373 --> 35:38.134
I'm not good company right now.

35:38.134 --> 35:40.893
Company?

35:40.893 --> 35:41.763
So now I'm company?

35:41.763 --> 35:43.443
Like, I'm a roommate or somethin'?

35:43.443 --> 35:45.612
Or I'm just comin' by to
see you and that's it?

35:45.612 --> 35:46.445
Charles.

35:46.445 --> 35:47.866
Seriously, not now.

35:47.866 --> 35:50.049
I'm your man, Leslie.

35:50.049 --> 35:52.752
That's why I came here.

35:52.752 --> 35:54.586
I can just go sit on
the couch or somethin'.

35:54.586 --> 35:55.904
Or go upstairs.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.373
Look, my aunt's here.

35:57.373 --> 35:58.206
I'm good.

36:00.086 --> 36:01.740
Y'all actin' weird.

36:01.740 --> 36:02.740
All a y'all.

36:04.469 --> 36:06.340
This is crazy.

36:06.340 --> 36:07.905
This is all crazy.

36:07.905 --> 36:10.009
Just talk to me.

36:10.009 --> 36:11.465
Baby, what is it?

36:11.465 --> 36:12.476
Just talk to me.

36:12.476 --> 36:14.567
When I feel like talkin'
'bout it, I will talk to you.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.233
See?

36:16.233 --> 36:18.559
Now that's your depression
trying to set in.

36:18.559 --> 36:21.487
Stayin' on this couch is not gonna help.

36:21.487 --> 36:24.086
Now you have to get up and move around.

36:24.086 --> 36:26.010
Just let me rest.

36:26.010 --> 36:27.927
I will talk to you when
I talk to the doctor.

36:27.927 --> 36:30.167
I don't know nothin' right now.

36:30.167 --> 36:32.495
I will call you when
I'm ready to tell you.

36:33.462 --> 36:35.295
Just go.

36:37.817 --> 36:38.650
You should-

36:38.650 --> 36:40.067
Leave me alone.

36:42.941 --> 36:44.638
Now you bein'
real ridiculous right now.

36:44.638 --> 36:46.055
Rene?

36:47.398 --> 36:48.363
Call me.

36:48.363 --> 36:49.213
- I'll call you.
- Please.

36:49.213 --> 36:50.171
Just go.

36:50.171 --> 36:51.347
I'll call you.

36:51.347 --> 36:52.904
Leslie, I love you.

36:52.904 --> 36:54.401
You know that, right?

36:54.401 --> 36:55.318
I love you.

36:57.506 --> 36:59.673
Charles, I love you too.

37:00.688 --> 37:03.473
But I really, seriously.

37:03.473 --> 37:05.519
Just give me some time please.

37:05.519 --> 37:10.519
Well, just
don't forget to call, okay?

37:11.339 --> 37:12.793
If you need anything, just let me know.

37:12.793 --> 37:14.392
Text me, anything.

37:14.392 --> 37:17.051
Charles, I'll call you.

37:17.051 --> 37:17.884
Okay?

37:17.884 --> 37:18.717
We'll get through this.

37:18.717 --> 37:20.550
I'll call you.

37:20.550 --> 37:22.550
What's wrong with her?

37:27.089 --> 37:27.922
You sure?

37:32.393 --> 37:34.288
I'll call you.

37:35.121 --> 37:37.140
Thanks, Rene.

37:37.140 --> 37:38.206
I love you.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.851
Now, we're gonna get you a specialist,

37:47.851 --> 37:50.980
so we can find out
exactly what's goin' on.

37:50.980 --> 37:51.813
Okay?

37:52.808 --> 37:54.555
Okay.

37:54.555 --> 37:57.555
We're gonna get through this.

37:57.555 --> 37:59.040
Have you taken your antidepressants?

37:59.040 --> 38:00.157
Yup.

38:00.157 --> 38:01.651
I'll tell you what.

38:01.651 --> 38:04.116
I'm gonna keep Nina for
the rest of the week.

38:04.116 --> 38:04.949
And next.

38:05.796 --> 38:07.935
Now I need you to get yourself together.

38:07.935 --> 38:11.751
So we can figure out
what we need to do next.

38:11.751 --> 38:13.472
In the meantime, you need to get out

38:13.472 --> 38:15.022
and collect your thoughts.

38:15.022 --> 38:18.228
Right now, I just wanna rest.

38:18.228 --> 38:19.811
I'll go get Nina.

38:47.475 --> 38:48.308
Hello?

38:49.596 --> 38:51.013
Hello, Porsche?

38:51.918 --> 38:53.561
It's Rene.

38:53.561 --> 38:54.978
Rene?

38:55.813 --> 38:59.313
I know we haven't talked in awhile, but,

39:00.359 --> 39:02.705
I have some bad news to
tell you about Leslie.

39:02.705 --> 39:05.365
I haven't heard from you
in years and you called me

39:05.365 --> 39:08.123
to say you have some bad news?

39:08.123 --> 39:11.469
What bad news you have to
tell me about my daughter?

39:11.469 --> 39:14.230
She has stage three breast cancer.

39:14.230 --> 39:15.063
Stage three breast cancer?

39:15.063 --> 39:16.184
When did you find this out?

39:16.184 --> 39:19.800
I'm just now
findin' out about it, myself.

39:19.800 --> 39:24.800
She went to the doctor the other
day and they discovered it.

39:25.465 --> 39:28.915
It's the same cancer Mama died from.

39:28.915 --> 39:30.527
So, this is very serious.

39:30.527 --> 39:31.507
I know it's serious.

39:31.507 --> 39:33.487
I had the same breast cancer.

39:33.487 --> 39:34.604
What?

39:34.604 --> 39:36.194
I'm a survivor?

39:36.194 --> 39:38.251
Since when did you have cancer?

39:38.251 --> 39:40.769
I was diagnosed while I was in prison.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.033
I reached out to you when it happened.

39:42.033 --> 39:43.700
I wrote you letters.

39:44.616 --> 39:47.046
But you never responded.

39:47.046 --> 39:51.038
You didn't respond to any of my letters.

39:51.038 --> 39:52.788
Porsche, I'm sorry.

39:55.727 --> 39:59.894
I received your letters,
but, I never opened them.

40:05.074 --> 40:06.824
I was angry with you.

40:08.720 --> 40:11.720
All we ever did was argue and fight.

40:13.372 --> 40:16.704
You wouldn't listen to
me, so I cut you off.

40:16.704 --> 40:19.499
I didn't wanna deal with you anymore.

40:19.499 --> 40:21.307
You did more than cut me off, Rene.

40:21.307 --> 40:22.272
You stole from me.

40:22.272 --> 40:23.932
You stole my daughter.

40:23.932 --> 40:26.704
You stole what our mother
left us when she died.

40:26.704 --> 40:28.955
And you stole my soul.

40:28.955 --> 40:30.011
You are my big sister.

40:30.011 --> 40:32.655
You were supposed to look out for me.

40:32.655 --> 40:34.162
But you didn't.

40:34.162 --> 40:36.079
Because you're selfish.

40:37.643 --> 40:40.234
You were always selfish.

40:40.234 --> 40:42.016
And I know you were
supposed to look out for me,

40:42.016 --> 40:43.673
because that's what Mom told you to do.

40:43.673 --> 40:44.754
I heard her.

40:44.754 --> 40:45.712
But you know what you did?

40:45.712 --> 40:47.718
You left me there.

40:47.718 --> 40:51.302
You left me with Mr.
Jenkins and he raped me.

40:51.302 --> 40:52.260
You left me.

40:52.260 --> 40:56.670
That was not my fault
what happened to you.

40:56.670 --> 41:00.753
And it wasn't my fault
that you ended up in jail.

41:03.402 --> 41:06.485
You're the one who's selfish, not me.

41:07.987 --> 41:10.320
I tried to take care of you.

41:11.315 --> 41:12.982
And what did you do?

41:15.775 --> 41:17.108
What did you do?

41:18.505 --> 41:20.659
You didn't listen.

41:20.659 --> 41:24.557
You got pregnant and you ended up in jail.

41:24.557 --> 41:25.890
That was on you.

41:30.733 --> 41:33.483
I didn't steal anything from you.

41:34.724 --> 41:38.156
So, that's why you poisoned
my daughter against me?

41:40.208 --> 41:41.875
I wrote you letters.

41:43.651 --> 41:45.506
I wanted to see my daughter
and you didn't bring her

41:45.506 --> 41:46.459
to visit me.

41:46.459 --> 41:47.292
Not once.

41:49.065 --> 41:52.865
I went to prison for
somethin' I didn't do.

41:52.865 --> 41:55.702
And now you have this
new-found self-righteousness

41:55.702 --> 41:57.673
to call me now that my
daughter has breast cancer

41:57.673 --> 42:00.006
and tell me that she's sick?

42:03.713 --> 42:06.107
You know what, Rene?

42:06.107 --> 42:06.940
I'm not doin' this.

42:06.940 --> 42:09.440
I can't talk to you right now.

42:37.912 --> 42:39.745
Hey, girl.

42:41.104 --> 42:42.187
What's wrong?

42:43.833 --> 42:44.666
Have a seat.

42:44.666 --> 42:46.000
Now, I've been calling you.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.605
Bee.

42:47.605 --> 42:48.560
What's goin' on?

42:48.560 --> 42:50.844
I thought I was gonna have
to send the troops in or-

42:50.844 --> 42:54.668
Bee, honestly, I haven't
been able to talk to anybody.

42:54.668 --> 42:56.102
Okay.

42:56.102 --> 42:57.874
I'm so numb right now.

42:57.874 --> 43:01.124
I been dealin' with some real bad news.

43:02.361 --> 43:04.111
Bad news like what?

43:06.039 --> 43:10.706
My doctor says I have three
stage three breast cancer.

43:13.154 --> 43:15.279
What?

43:15.279 --> 43:16.362
Are you sure?

43:17.902 --> 43:19.621
I mean, could it-

43:19.621 --> 43:21.441
Could there be some kind of mistake?

43:21.441 --> 43:22.775
I wish it was.

43:22.775 --> 43:23.942
I wish it was.

43:25.044 --> 43:29.407
I mean, so what exactly
did the doctor say?

43:29.407 --> 43:32.074
Triple negative breast cancer.

43:33.280 --> 43:34.280
Stage three.

43:37.841 --> 43:39.324
Does Rene and Charles know?

43:39.324 --> 43:40.446
Yeah.

43:40.446 --> 43:42.808
I told both of 'em.

43:42.808 --> 43:44.359
You want some?

43:44.359 --> 43:45.531
I'm gonna go get you some coffee.

43:45.531 --> 43:46.364
You like it black, girl?

43:46.364 --> 43:47.380
Of course you like it black.

43:47.380 --> 43:48.713
You always have.

43:50.235 --> 43:51.068
Yeah.

43:56.283 --> 43:59.271
Okay, here you go, girl.

43:59.271 --> 44:00.521
So, now, just.

44:00.521 --> 44:03.745
You know, take a deep breath.

44:03.745 --> 44:07.745
Now, tell me again exactly
what the doctor said?

44:11.367 --> 44:12.867
Triple negative.

44:13.746 --> 44:15.348
Breast cancer.

44:15.348 --> 44:17.068
And it's stage three, so.

44:17.068 --> 44:20.978
It's serious.

44:20.978 --> 44:23.728
I mean, why's it happenin' to me?

44:28.567 --> 44:30.903
I feel so horrible, like, I mean.

44:30.903 --> 44:31.736
I mean.

44:32.716 --> 44:33.549
What's next?

44:33.549 --> 44:35.277
I mean, there's gotta be a game plan here.

44:35.277 --> 44:37.027
What's the next step?

44:37.982 --> 44:41.018
Monday I have an appointment
with an oncologist.

44:41.018 --> 44:43.435
Aunt Rene set that up for me.

44:44.360 --> 44:47.612
I mean, guess I'll find out more then.

44:47.612 --> 44:49.275
Oh man.

44:49.275 --> 44:51.704
It's like when I heard the words,

44:51.704 --> 44:53.121
my heart dropped.

44:54.847 --> 44:55.680
Panicked.

44:58.438 --> 44:59.932
I don't know what to do.

44:59.932 --> 45:00.765
Don't.

45:00.765 --> 45:01.682
I'm scared.

45:01.682 --> 45:03.085
Don't start
cryin' on me, Leslie, look.

45:03.085 --> 45:05.268
Like, Bee, you know, I'm so afraid.

45:05.268 --> 45:06.404
Look, look.

45:06.404 --> 45:09.541
I know you probably feel
alone, baby, but you not.

45:09.541 --> 45:11.303
Like, why is this happenin' to me?

45:11.303 --> 45:12.325
Don't ask why.

45:12.325 --> 45:13.388
I can't answer that either, okay?

45:13.388 --> 45:15.337
I gotta be here to take care of my baby.

45:15.337 --> 45:16.170
And that's okay.

45:16.170 --> 45:18.452
Look, don't even think like that, okay?

45:18.452 --> 45:19.285
Look at me.

45:19.285 --> 45:20.118
Look at me.

45:20.118 --> 45:21.195
Look at me, okay?

45:22.028 --> 45:23.910
Look, you don't have to
go through this alone.

45:23.910 --> 45:24.743
Okay?

45:24.743 --> 45:27.168
You know you my girl and what
happens to you happens to me.

45:27.168 --> 45:28.391
I wanna go to sleep and not wake up.

45:28.391 --> 45:29.224
No.

45:29.224 --> 45:30.780
No, no, no, that's not it.

45:30.780 --> 45:32.903
Is your depression comin' back, baby?

45:32.903 --> 45:35.056
'Cause, look, you know we don't
have time to be doin' that.

45:35.056 --> 45:35.889
Okay?

45:35.889 --> 45:37.141
I don't need you sinkin'.

45:37.141 --> 45:38.212
I don't need you goin' back.

45:38.212 --> 45:39.045
Okay?

45:39.045 --> 45:41.124
We done already been down
that path and we don't need

45:41.124 --> 45:42.708
to go backwards.

45:42.708 --> 45:43.541
Okay?

45:43.541 --> 45:44.374
You're right.

45:44.374 --> 45:46.688
So, we're gonna focus on movin' forward.

45:46.688 --> 45:49.988
When you get home, you're
gonna take that medicine, okay?

45:49.988 --> 45:50.988
You promise?

45:52.493 --> 45:53.326
Hello?

45:53.326 --> 45:54.159
Yeah.

45:54.159 --> 45:54.992
You promise?

45:54.992 --> 45:55.866
Wipe your face.
For you.

45:55.866 --> 45:56.699
Clean up, okay?

45:56.699 --> 45:58.534
I promise.

45:58.534 --> 45:59.958
I'm gon' take it when I get home.

45:59.958 --> 46:01.949
How's Charles takin' all this?

46:01.949 --> 46:03.647
I don't even know.

46:03.647 --> 46:04.888
He keep tryin' to talk.

46:04.888 --> 46:07.809
I mean, blowin' up my phone.

46:07.809 --> 46:08.642
I-

46:08.642 --> 46:10.308
Honestly, this is the
first time I've really been

46:10.308 --> 46:12.778
able to talk about it.

46:12.778 --> 46:15.226
This moment is the first time

46:15.226 --> 46:17.014
I can see a little bit of light.

46:17.014 --> 46:17.847
That's good.

46:17.847 --> 46:19.180
So, I mean-
I love you.

46:19.180 --> 46:20.757
What you got planned
for the rest of the day?

46:20.757 --> 46:21.957
I love you too, sis.

46:21.957 --> 46:23.309
Let's do somethin', okay?

46:23.309 --> 46:25.014
You wanna go to the movies?

46:25.014 --> 46:25.847
Mm mm.

46:25.847 --> 46:26.680
We could go shoppin'.

46:26.680 --> 46:27.513
I need to get my nails done anyway.

46:27.513 --> 46:28.971
No, no.

46:28.971 --> 46:31.798
Rene took Nina so I can
have some quiet time.

46:33.105 --> 46:34.862
I'm just gonna go home, honestly.

46:34.862 --> 46:35.978
I'm just gonna go home.

46:35.978 --> 46:39.347
I don't know if I should
leave you alone right now.

46:39.347 --> 46:40.180
I'm good.

46:40.180 --> 46:41.013
I'm good.

46:41.013 --> 46:42.961
Just don't
go dark on me, okay?

46:42.961 --> 46:43.794
Bee, I'm good-

46:43.794 --> 46:44.627
'Cause you know I'm
only a phone call away.

46:44.627 --> 46:46.539
I'll come pick you up.

46:46.539 --> 46:47.372
Bee, I'm good.

46:47.372 --> 46:48.205
I'll come stay the night.

46:48.205 --> 46:49.038
Keep you company-

46:49.038 --> 46:49.871
Bee, I'm good.

46:49.871 --> 46:50.704
I'm good.

46:50.704 --> 46:52.631
Bee. I'm good.

46:52.631 --> 46:53.464
Seriously.

46:53.464 --> 46:54.464
All right.

46:57.244 --> 46:58.293
And don't pop up.

47:00.955 --> 47:03.503
I can't promise you that.

47:03.503 --> 47:04.336
You laughin'.

47:04.336 --> 47:05.169
I'm so serious.

47:05.169 --> 47:06.002
I know you are.

47:06.002 --> 47:06.835
'Cause I know you-

47:06.835 --> 47:08.331
But I can't promise you that.

47:08.331 --> 47:11.599
I ain't tryin' to go dark,
but, honestly, just give me

47:11.599 --> 47:12.432
this time.

47:13.880 --> 47:16.312
I'll give you your space.

47:16.312 --> 47:17.903
But I will pop up on you.

47:17.903 --> 47:19.875
Six times seven is 42.

47:19.875 --> 47:21.708
Six times eight is 49.

47:22.800 --> 47:25.383
And then, you get that, 49, 50.

47:26.996 --> 47:28.079
Add that one.

47:38.766 --> 47:39.978
Nina.

47:39.978 --> 47:40.811
Come here, baby.

47:40.811 --> 47:42.455
Give me a hug.

47:42.455 --> 47:43.361
I missed you.

47:43.361 --> 47:44.928
Did you come to pick me up?

47:44.928 --> 47:47.290
Yep, I came to pick you up.

47:47.290 --> 47:49.103
Hey, Leslie.

47:49.103 --> 47:51.354
I've been trying to reach you.

47:51.354 --> 47:52.726
I know, I've been busy.

47:52.726 --> 47:54.395
How are you?

47:54.395 --> 47:55.575
Busy as ever.

47:55.575 --> 47:57.249
Busy is good sometimes.

47:57.249 --> 47:58.967
Yeah, that's what they say.

47:58.967 --> 48:00.755
I gotta pay these bills.

48:00.755 --> 48:01.706
- Nina.
- Don't we all?

48:01.706 --> 48:03.461
Finish your homework.

48:03.461 --> 48:05.846
Leslie, come here for a moment.

48:05.846 --> 48:09.096
- What's up, Auntie?
- Good luck.

48:11.873 --> 48:12.706
Yes?

48:13.569 --> 48:15.629
I told you I was keepin'
Nina for the rest of the week.

48:15.629 --> 48:16.990
And next.

48:16.990 --> 48:18.954
So, why are you here
to pick her up so soon?

48:18.954 --> 48:20.208
I miss her.

48:20.208 --> 48:22.789
Look, you told me to take
the meds, I took 'em.

48:22.789 --> 48:23.781
You told me to get out the house.

48:23.781 --> 48:25.379
I'm out the house.

48:25.379 --> 48:28.342
Is it so bad that I just
wanna be with my daughter?

48:28.342 --> 48:30.579
And I think you're
bein' a little hardheaded.

48:31.412 --> 48:33.965
But, okay, I mean you're here now.

48:33.965 --> 48:37.320
And that means you know she's
gonna wanna go home with you.

48:37.320 --> 48:39.578
I'm gonna call you this evenin'.

48:39.578 --> 48:41.242
So, answer the phone when I do.

48:41.242 --> 48:42.648
Okay.

48:42.648 --> 48:44.573
And don't go home and
jump back in bed and start

48:44.573 --> 48:45.670
worryin' again.

48:45.670 --> 48:47.087
Nina, let's go.

48:50.336 --> 48:51.715
Leslie.

48:51.715 --> 48:52.548
Trina.

48:54.775 --> 48:56.767
I been knowing you a long time.

48:56.767 --> 49:00.585
And I care about you just like a sister.

49:00.585 --> 49:02.665
You and Rene were there for me.

49:02.665 --> 49:05.998
When I got divorced and lost everything.

49:07.991 --> 49:10.690
You helped me get through that.

49:10.690 --> 49:12.839
I'll never forget it.

49:12.839 --> 49:16.535
You know, you can call
me anytime for anything.

49:16.535 --> 49:17.702
And I'm there.

49:19.370 --> 49:20.620
Whatever it is.

49:21.585 --> 49:22.835
Please call me.

49:24.077 --> 49:27.082
Look, Trina, I'm not
tryin' to be rude, okay?

49:27.082 --> 49:28.781
And I know you wanna help.

49:28.781 --> 49:31.632
But nobody can help me right now.

49:31.632 --> 49:36.048
Everybody says they wanna
help, but, not with this.

49:36.048 --> 49:37.787
But thanks anyway.

49:37.787 --> 49:38.620
Nina.

49:45.077 --> 49:48.670
Is everything okay with Leslie, Rene?

49:48.670 --> 49:49.809
No.

49:49.809 --> 49:52.309
Everything is not okay, Trina.

49:53.897 --> 49:56.176
Leslie's gonna need our prayers.

49:56.176 --> 49:59.591
Now that's all I can say right now.

49:59.591 --> 50:03.256
She'll tell you when
she's ready, I'm sure.

50:03.256 --> 50:04.339
But, for now,

50:06.649 --> 50:08.149
just pray for her.

50:11.316 --> 50:13.163
No one
understands what I'm feelin'.

50:13.163 --> 50:15.190
They wanna help me, but
what can they really do

50:15.190 --> 50:16.460
to change any of this?

50:16.460 --> 50:17.571
Nothing.

50:17.571 --> 50:19.440
They can't even make it go away.

50:19.440 --> 50:20.788
The hugs, the "I love you's.

50:20.788 --> 50:22.417
Everyone's tellin' me, "I'm here for you.

50:22.417 --> 50:23.688
You're gonna get through this."

50:23.688 --> 50:25.856
I guess it makes them
feel better by sayin' it,

50:25.856 --> 50:28.187
but, for me, it does nothing.

50:28.187 --> 50:29.423
They're not gonna die.

50:29.423 --> 50:30.948
I'm numb to all of it.

50:30.948 --> 50:32.803
What I am is afraid.

50:32.803 --> 50:36.155
What I need is for all this to go away.

50:36.155 --> 50:37.794
Hello, Miss Brown.

50:37.794 --> 50:38.627
Dr. Miles.

50:38.627 --> 50:40.082
Nice to meet you.

50:40.082 --> 50:41.613
So how are you holdin' up today?

50:41.613 --> 50:45.368
I'm barely holdin' up.

50:45.368 --> 50:47.941
Okay, well, let me
start off by askin' you.

50:47.941 --> 50:51.123
How much do you know already?

50:51.123 --> 50:52.706
I mean, not much.

50:53.959 --> 50:58.588
All I know is I have triple
negative breast cancer.

50:58.588 --> 51:00.285
I'm so scared.

51:00.285 --> 51:02.421
I don't know what's happenin' to me.

51:02.421 --> 51:05.044
Well, I know this
is very frightening for you.

51:05.044 --> 51:07.167
So I'm going to do my very
best to explain to you

51:07.167 --> 51:10.025
exactly what's happening and
what you're dealing with.

51:10.025 --> 51:11.959
You have what is called
bilateral triple negative

51:11.959 --> 51:13.568
breast cancer.

51:13.568 --> 51:16.157
And you are in stage three.

51:16.157 --> 51:18.050
That being said, because it's so late

51:18.050 --> 51:19.664
in your treatment phase,

51:19.664 --> 51:23.387
we're going to have to
act very aggressively.

51:23.387 --> 51:27.387
Like, am I gonna die?

51:29.177 --> 51:31.920
Listen.

51:31.920 --> 51:34.744
I know those thoughts are
going through your mind.

51:34.744 --> 51:36.019
But we're going to do
everything in our power

51:36.019 --> 51:39.102
to make sure that it's not happening.

51:40.080 --> 51:41.575
I just.

51:41.575 --> 51:43.405
I want you to be truthful with me.

51:43.405 --> 51:47.801
I have a daughter, so, I
need to know what to expect.

51:47.801 --> 51:50.917
Just don't give me false hope.

51:50.917 --> 51:55.214
Well, Miss Brown, this
is a very serious stage

51:55.214 --> 51:56.463
in your illness.

51:56.463 --> 51:58.466
You're in stage 3.

51:58.466 --> 52:01.010
So, we're going to do
everything we can to keep that

52:01.010 --> 52:03.548
from going any further.

52:03.548 --> 52:05.650
This isn't a easy journey.

52:05.650 --> 52:07.258
Anytime you're going through something,

52:07.258 --> 52:08.662
anything you're dealing with,

52:08.662 --> 52:09.495
anyway you're feeling,

52:09.495 --> 52:11.185
you have to let us know.

52:11.185 --> 52:13.286
And we can help you out by keeping this

52:13.286 --> 52:14.968
from going any further.

52:14.968 --> 52:19.385
And this can help you, also,
in the future with this.

52:29.277 --> 52:30.860
Leslie.

52:33.071 --> 52:34.488
What's that face?

52:39.490 --> 52:41.561
I mean, just give yourself
a moment to, you know,

52:41.561 --> 52:43.266
take a breath in.

52:43.266 --> 52:45.552
If you need to cry, go
ahead and just let it out.

52:45.552 --> 52:46.698
I'm here, all right?

52:46.698 --> 52:49.578
Girl, cryin' at gonna help me right now.

52:49.578 --> 52:54.222
This is like the nightmare
I can't wake up from.

52:54.222 --> 52:57.779
I gotta do chemotherapy, surgery.

52:57.779 --> 52:59.602
Bee.

52:59.602 --> 53:00.804
They gon' take my titties.

53:00.804 --> 53:03.065
Out of all the things

53:03.065 --> 53:05.261
you worried about, you're
worried about your titties?

53:05.261 --> 53:08.922
I mean, look, that could
be a blessing in disguise.

53:08.922 --> 53:10.780
Aren't they gonna give you some in return?

53:10.780 --> 53:12.373
Like, don't you have to go
to, like, a titty fitting

53:12.373 --> 53:13.258
or something like that?

53:13.258 --> 53:16.201
Where they size and you get
to choose what kind you want.

53:16.201 --> 53:17.757
Oh, you mean,
like, for my troubles?

53:17.757 --> 53:18.590
Yeah.

53:18.590 --> 53:21.095
I mean, like, you could probably
get a C, a D, a double D?

53:21.095 --> 53:22.068
I can't with you right now.

53:22.068 --> 53:23.568
Triple D?

53:23.568 --> 53:24.543
At least, you gonna-

53:24.543 --> 53:25.376
I mean, what you now?

53:25.376 --> 53:26.640
A?

53:26.640 --> 53:27.473
You for real?

53:27.473 --> 53:28.638
You know, I'm just sayin', you know.

53:28.638 --> 53:29.798
I'm like a A and a half.

53:30.795 --> 53:32.375
Nah, but for real, you got those papers?

53:32.375 --> 53:34.271
I wanna go ahead and
start lookin' over 'em,

53:34.271 --> 53:35.104
so we can see-

53:35.104 --> 53:37.410
Nah, I left 'em in a car.

53:37.410 --> 53:39.622
It's like a long walk to the car.

53:42.540 --> 53:43.373
Sorry.

53:46.116 --> 53:47.447
You hungry?

53:47.447 --> 53:49.389
I was thinkin' 'bout
orderin' some Chinese.

53:49.389 --> 53:50.965
You want some?

53:50.965 --> 53:52.536
Just order me whatever you get.

53:52.536 --> 53:53.369
All right, good.

53:53.369 --> 53:56.338
I'ma go get these papers,
though, and get us some Chinese.

53:56.338 --> 53:58.547
So you can eat somethin', okay?

53:58.547 --> 53:59.380
I need aspirin.

53:59.380 --> 54:01.213
My head is killin' me.

54:10.250 --> 54:11.250
Hey, Auntie.

54:12.539 --> 54:16.527
Okay, so, tell
me what the doctor said.

54:16.527 --> 54:19.110
I have to start chemotherapy.

54:22.171 --> 54:25.561
Okay and what else?

54:25.561 --> 54:28.061
Um.

54:29.097 --> 54:32.347
They have to do reconstructive surgery.

54:36.218 --> 54:37.657
Well, I mean, they can do

54:37.657 --> 54:42.657
reconstructive surgery, so,
don't let that get you down.

54:43.114 --> 54:47.313
I'm gonna go with you to your treatments.

54:47.313 --> 54:49.563
Trina can manage the salon.

54:52.119 --> 54:52.952
Listen.

54:52.952 --> 54:57.215
I called Porsche and I
told her about all of this.

54:57.215 --> 54:59.109
I hope that doesn't upset you.

54:59.109 --> 55:02.192
I mean, that doesn't upset me, but,

55:03.064 --> 55:04.430
what can she do for me?

55:04.430 --> 55:05.263
Nothin'.

55:06.413 --> 55:08.391
That's one of
the things I wanted to talk

55:08.391 --> 55:09.474
to you about.

55:10.388 --> 55:13.108
I have been selfish and
so protective of you

55:13.108 --> 55:14.441
your whole life.

55:15.507 --> 55:17.268
And I blame myself for
you and your mother's

55:17.268 --> 55:19.612
broken relationship.

55:19.612 --> 55:21.819
Auntie, none of that is your fault.

55:21.819 --> 55:23.757
She made her own decisions.

55:23.757 --> 55:27.606
It's all on her that she hasn't been here.

55:27.606 --> 55:29.470
That's what
I've been tellin' myself

55:29.470 --> 55:31.486
all these years.

55:31.486 --> 55:33.897
But that's not true.

55:33.897 --> 55:36.499
I was angry with her
and I wanted to keep her

55:36.499 --> 55:38.416
from ruining your life.

55:39.461 --> 55:42.789
I was supposed to be there for her, too.

55:42.789 --> 55:43.872
And I wasn't.

55:45.266 --> 55:46.155
Wait.

55:46.155 --> 55:48.820
What are you talkin' about?

55:48.820 --> 55:51.793
It is my
fault that I didn't.

55:51.793 --> 55:54.378
I wasn't tryin' to know
anything about her or what

55:54.378 --> 55:57.004
she was going through.

55:57.004 --> 55:59.087
I never thought about it.

56:00.028 --> 56:03.020
I completely shut her out of our lives.

56:03.020 --> 56:06.680
But Porsche has never
been a mother to me.

56:06.680 --> 56:10.601
A woman who is a mother doesn't go to jail

56:10.601 --> 56:12.458
and then leave her child behind.

56:12.458 --> 56:15.105
She's been out, what, how many years now?

56:15.105 --> 56:18.706
She never came
to look for me, I mean.

56:18.706 --> 56:20.639
I just don't agree with you.

56:20.639 --> 56:23.800
You're blaming yourself
and it's not your fault.

56:23.800 --> 56:24.633
Like.

56:24.633 --> 56:25.466
Leslie.

56:25.466 --> 56:27.307
I don't need to talk to her.

56:27.307 --> 56:29.648
And, honestly, I have enough
to deal with than dealin'

56:29.648 --> 56:31.974
with her right now.

56:31.974 --> 56:34.247
Leslie, just stop.

56:34.247 --> 56:37.223
It's my fault that you feel this way.

56:37.223 --> 56:38.056
No.

56:38.056 --> 56:39.514
Now, she is your mother.

56:39.514 --> 56:43.113
And I realize I was wrong
for shutting the door on her.

56:43.113 --> 56:45.554
I shouldn't have done that.

56:45.554 --> 56:46.498
I don't under-

56:46.498 --> 56:48.051
You know what?

56:48.051 --> 56:49.315
I don't understand.

56:49.315 --> 56:52.188
And why are you tellin' me all this now?

56:52.188 --> 56:55.707
Like, what point are you provin' here?

56:55.707 --> 56:56.555
It's just unnecessary.

56:56.555 --> 56:58.208
I mean.

56:58.208 --> 57:01.502
It's no matter
if she knows or not, but

57:01.502 --> 57:03.360
all of this is her fault.

57:03.360 --> 57:04.568
You all right?

57:04.568 --> 57:08.581
Look, Leslie,
I'm gonna go check on Nina.

57:08.581 --> 57:11.353
We can talk more about your mother later.

57:11.353 --> 57:14.532
You go ahead and spend
time talkin' with Charles.

57:14.532 --> 57:15.449
Yeah, um.

57:17.939 --> 57:19.606
Kiss my baby for me.

57:20.625 --> 57:22.542
Of course.

57:22.542 --> 57:23.375
I will.

57:24.514 --> 57:26.300
- Okay.
- Goodbye, Leslie.

57:26.300 --> 57:27.133
Bye.

57:30.862 --> 57:32.810
What was that about?

57:32.810 --> 57:34.098
Surgery?

57:34.098 --> 57:34.931
Yeah.

57:36.874 --> 57:37.791
For what?

57:40.837 --> 57:43.307
You know how you need
to talk about somethin',

57:43.307 --> 57:46.590
but you just don't feel
like talkin' about it?

57:46.590 --> 57:48.438
Yeah, but that's what I'm here for.

57:48.438 --> 57:50.414
I mean, it's like I'm left
in the dark, you know?

57:50.414 --> 57:52.101
About a lot of stuff.

57:52.101 --> 57:52.934
Talk to me.

57:52.934 --> 57:54.343
I know, I know.

57:55.865 --> 57:56.698
So.

57:58.661 --> 58:02.411
Doctor says I have stage
three breast cancer.

58:04.972 --> 58:09.639
And I have to have surgery
to remove both of my breasts.

58:13.635 --> 58:17.513
I don't understand.

58:17.513 --> 58:19.108
Can we get a second opinion?

58:19.108 --> 58:20.318
Have you talked to anybody else?

58:20.318 --> 58:22.893
Babe, trust me, I've thought about it

58:22.893 --> 58:24.643
and thought about it.

58:25.740 --> 58:29.238
And, I'm sorry, I know I was hard on you

58:29.238 --> 58:30.573
with the biting and-

58:30.573 --> 58:32.134
It's all right, it's all right.

58:32.134 --> 58:35.211
But, I know it has to be
something, because my breasts

58:35.211 --> 58:37.411
are really, really sore.

58:37.411 --> 58:38.378
I'm here, babe.

58:38.378 --> 58:41.482
Like, they hurt all the time.

58:41.482 --> 58:42.453
What can I do?

58:42.453 --> 58:44.120
Right now, I just.

58:45.036 --> 58:47.286
I just want you to hold me.

58:54.310 --> 58:56.433
You're gonna be just fine.

58:56.433 --> 58:58.385
You're gonna get through this, okay?

58:58.385 --> 58:59.218
I don't know.

58:59.218 --> 59:01.551
I keep thinkin' 'bout dying.

59:02.982 --> 59:03.941
Don't talk about dying.

59:03.941 --> 59:06.044
I'm not gonna let that happen.

59:06.044 --> 59:08.240
Not gonna let nothin'
like that happen to you.

59:09.073 --> 59:10.401
All right?

59:10.401 --> 59:13.320
You're stronger than that.

59:13.320 --> 59:14.560
I just can't help it.

59:14.560 --> 59:17.310
But I know you'll be here for me.

59:18.573 --> 59:20.977
I'm not goin' nowhere.

59:20.977 --> 59:21.962
I love you.

59:21.962 --> 59:24.630
I love you, too.

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:34.193
Hello, Porsche?

01:00:34.193 --> 01:00:35.026
It's Rene.

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:40.765
Can we please talk?

01:02:33.731 --> 01:02:34.564
Mom?

01:02:34.564 --> 01:02:36.559
What?

01:02:45.687 --> 01:02:46.520
Nina.

01:02:54.149 --> 01:02:55.649
Mommy's very sick.

01:03:00.149 --> 01:03:01.899
I have breast cancer.

01:03:03.181 --> 01:03:04.727
Do you know what that is?

01:03:04.727 --> 01:03:06.189
Yes.

01:03:06.189 --> 01:03:07.356
You gonna die?

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:09.487
I'm scared.

01:03:11.416 --> 01:03:15.370
Listen, I don't want you to be scared.

01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:17.310
I'm not gonna die, okay?

01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:20.504
I'm gonna get treatments
and I'm gonna get better.

01:03:20.504 --> 01:03:23.336
But I need you to be Mommy's
big brave girl, okay?

01:03:23.336 --> 01:03:25.552
I don't want you worryin' about me dying

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:27.385
or anything like that.

01:03:28.331 --> 01:03:30.914
So, I'm gonna go through a lot.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.522
I'm gonna lose my hair.

01:03:34.522 --> 01:03:38.764
I'm gonna, probably,
be really, really sick

01:03:38.764 --> 01:03:40.911
after treatments.

01:03:40.911 --> 01:03:42.955
But it'll be okay, okay?

01:03:42.955 --> 01:03:44.306
I want you to be strong.

01:03:44.306 --> 01:03:46.416
And I need you to trust me, okay?

01:03:46.416 --> 01:03:47.249
Okay.

01:03:47.249 --> 01:03:48.460
You're takin' treatments,
then why does your hair

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:49.877
have to fall out?

01:03:51.948 --> 01:03:54.707
Nina, it's called side effects.

01:03:54.707 --> 01:03:55.606
You know.

01:03:55.606 --> 01:03:59.201
Sometimes medicine makes you
sicker, before you get better.

01:03:59.201 --> 01:04:00.754
That's all that is.

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:03.809
But I need you to be brave, okay?

01:04:03.809 --> 01:04:06.840
And I want you to be strong for Mommy.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.800
You may see me go through a lot.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:11.182
You may see me cry a lot.

01:04:11.182 --> 01:04:14.191
I'm sick, but I always want
you to be strong, okay?

01:04:14.191 --> 01:04:17.531
But, no matter what, I love you.

01:04:17.531 --> 01:04:20.781
And I'm gonna get better for you, okay?

01:04:31.666 --> 01:04:32.499
Porsche.

01:04:34.674 --> 01:04:36.384
You're here.

01:04:37.988 --> 01:04:38.821
Come in.

01:04:43.293 --> 01:04:44.293
Have a seat.

01:04:51.152 --> 01:04:55.137
I didn't expect you to get here so soon.

01:04:55.137 --> 01:04:56.304
I'm surprised.

01:04:58.768 --> 01:04:59.601
My daughter's sick.

01:04:59.601 --> 01:05:01.220
What'd you expect?

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.053
I mean, this is serious.

01:05:02.053 --> 01:05:03.216
She could die.

01:05:03.216 --> 01:05:05.024
Look, I hope
we can talk, for once,

01:05:05.024 --> 01:05:06.797
without fighting, Porsche.

01:05:06.797 --> 01:05:08.630
Of course I know that.

01:05:09.977 --> 01:05:11.728
It's just that you
didn't inform me that you

01:05:11.728 --> 01:05:14.335
would be here so soon.

01:05:14.335 --> 01:05:17.660
I mean, I could've made
arrangements for you.

01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:19.553
Arrangements?

01:05:19.553 --> 01:05:20.836
I've been takin' care of me all this time.

01:05:20.836 --> 01:05:25.546
What makes you think I would
depend on you for anything?

01:05:25.546 --> 01:05:27.536
Where's my daughter?

01:05:27.536 --> 01:05:30.430
She's at
her apartment resting.

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:32.060
Okay.

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:33.880
Well you wanted to talk.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:34.713
I'm here.

01:05:36.719 --> 01:05:37.552
Look.

01:05:39.053 --> 01:05:42.031
I'm sorry about a lot of things.

01:05:42.031 --> 01:05:43.531
We were both kids.

01:05:44.719 --> 01:05:49.302
Damaged in different ways,
but both damaged growin' up.

01:05:50.799 --> 01:05:53.979
I mean, Mama did the best she could.

01:05:53.979 --> 01:05:56.653
And maybe it wasn't enough.

01:05:56.653 --> 01:05:58.701
You know, maybe she had
the wrong man in her life

01:05:58.701 --> 01:05:59.546
after our father died.

01:05:59.546 --> 01:06:00.629
I don't know.

01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:04.321
But I have tried to forget all about it.

01:06:04.321 --> 01:06:06.238
It was a long time ago.

01:06:08.377 --> 01:06:10.735
But you can't erase everything
in the past by just shutting

01:06:10.735 --> 01:06:11.652
it all out.

01:06:16.558 --> 01:06:17.391
So.

01:06:19.117 --> 01:06:21.367
Can we just start all over?

01:06:25.988 --> 01:06:27.503
I don't know, Rene.

01:06:27.503 --> 01:06:28.586
I don't know.

01:06:29.679 --> 01:06:33.118
None of this was supposed to
happen the way that it did.

01:06:33.118 --> 01:06:35.885
Do you realize you stopped
treating me the same way

01:06:35.885 --> 01:06:37.774
when Mama died?

01:06:37.774 --> 01:06:39.518
You stopped tellin' me that you loved me.

01:06:39.518 --> 01:06:41.615
You wouldn't hug me.

01:06:41.615 --> 01:06:42.810
I needed my sister.

01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:44.310
I needed a friend.

01:06:47.366 --> 01:06:48.283
Not a mama.

01:06:50.505 --> 01:06:52.172
I didn't know how.

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:54.717
Mama was hard on me.

01:06:56.732 --> 01:06:59.933
She made me responsible for
you and I resented that.

01:07:01.733 --> 01:07:04.328
I was just tryin' to be a teenager.

01:07:04.328 --> 01:07:07.411
I wasn't ready to be a mother to you.

01:07:11.633 --> 01:07:12.716
I don't know.

01:07:14.106 --> 01:07:14.939
I'm just.

01:07:14.939 --> 01:07:16.191
I'm sorry.

01:07:16.191 --> 01:07:17.524
That I hurt you.

01:07:20.776 --> 01:07:22.109
You know what?

01:07:24.621 --> 01:07:28.204
It's because she knew
she had cancer, Rene.

01:07:29.049 --> 01:07:30.614
She knew she was dying the whole time and

01:07:30.614 --> 01:07:32.324
didn't say anything.

01:07:32.324 --> 01:07:34.407
Kept everything a secret.

01:07:36.224 --> 01:07:40.949
I think she even suspected what
Mr. Jenkins was doin' to me.

01:07:40.949 --> 01:07:44.366
I mean, how do we sort all of this out?

01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:53.648
Why don't we go back to your room and

01:07:53.648 --> 01:07:56.356
you can get your things and you can stay

01:07:56.356 --> 01:07:58.523
in the house here with me?

01:08:00.497 --> 01:08:03.663
I'm gonna need some time, Rene.

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:06.603
I mean, we have plenty
of time for all of that.

01:08:06.603 --> 01:08:10.936
Right now, I'm just
concerned for Leslie, okay?

01:08:10.936 --> 01:08:14.304
I needa go back to the room
and get unpacked anyway.

01:08:14.304 --> 01:08:18.426
How 'bout I catch a cab and
tomorrow you can pick me up

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:20.594
and we can go and see her?

01:08:22.523 --> 01:08:25.705
Okay, that's understandable.

01:08:25.705 --> 01:08:28.825
Well, at least let me drive
you back to your room.

01:08:28.825 --> 01:08:32.992
I mean, I can call Leslie and
let her know that you're here.

01:08:32.992 --> 01:08:34.684
And both go in the morning.

01:08:34.684 --> 01:08:35.863
I think that's best.

01:08:35.863 --> 01:08:36.696
Okay.

01:09:02.731 --> 01:09:03.814
Can I help you?

01:09:03.814 --> 01:09:07.111
Yes, I'm looking for Leslie Brown.

01:09:07.111 --> 01:09:08.131
She's here.

01:09:08.131 --> 01:09:08.964
Is everything all right?

01:09:08.964 --> 01:09:11.036
Can I come in for a moment?

01:09:11.036 --> 01:09:11.868
Come in.

01:09:14.587 --> 01:09:15.421
Miss Leslie Brown?

01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:16.254
Yes.

01:09:16.254 --> 01:09:17.087
You might wanna have a seat.

01:09:17.087 --> 01:09:19.127
I have some news for you.

01:09:19.127 --> 01:09:19.960
I don't wanna sit down.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.301
Just tell me why you're here.

01:09:21.301 --> 01:09:25.823
Well, your Aunt Rene Brown,
she was in a car accident.

01:09:25.823 --> 01:09:26.657
What?

01:09:26.657 --> 01:09:27.850
I'm so sorry.

01:09:29.425 --> 01:09:30.372
She didn't make it through.

01:09:30.372 --> 01:09:32.251
What do you
mean she didn't make it?

01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:33.267
Oh God.

01:09:39.299 --> 01:09:42.008
We're here
for a very sad occasion.

01:09:42.008 --> 01:09:46.925
The passing transition of our
beautiful sister, Rene Brown.

01:09:49.603 --> 01:09:53.174
This is a very emotional
moment for many of you, but,

01:09:53.174 --> 01:09:56.341
the truth is, she's in a better place.

01:10:00.522 --> 01:10:02.827
And it's okay to express your emotions.

01:10:02.827 --> 01:10:04.124
It's okay to cry.

01:10:04.124 --> 01:10:06.235
Because it's all part of the process.

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:07.902
The healing process.

01:10:55.402 --> 01:10:56.235
Hi.

01:10:58.110 --> 01:11:00.238
Mommy, who's that lady?

01:11:00.238 --> 01:11:01.550
Your grandmother.

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:03.239
My grandmother?

01:11:03.239 --> 01:11:04.861
I have a grandmother?

01:11:04.861 --> 01:11:06.194
Yeah.

01:11:07.466 --> 01:11:09.549
Can I call you Grandma?

01:11:11.626 --> 01:11:14.109
Of course you can.

01:11:14.109 --> 01:11:16.808
I have somethin' for you.

01:11:16.808 --> 01:11:18.391
Thank you.

01:11:38.533 --> 01:11:39.366
Rene.

01:11:42.730 --> 01:11:43.813
I'm so sorry.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.667
I hope you can forgive me.

01:11:54.494 --> 01:11:55.661
I forgive you.

01:11:57.361 --> 01:11:59.691
I thought we had time.

01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:04.303
God, I thought we had time.

01:12:04.303 --> 01:12:07.720
Oh God.

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:13.286
Hey.
Hi.

01:12:14.335 --> 01:12:15.907
Porsche, how are you?

01:12:15.907 --> 01:12:17.177
I'm Charles.

01:12:17.177 --> 01:12:19.075
Leslie's boyfriend.

01:12:19.075 --> 01:12:20.297
Nice to meet you.

01:12:20.297 --> 01:12:21.743
So, how long you guys been together?

01:12:21.743 --> 01:12:24.934
Ah, about three and a half years now.

01:12:24.934 --> 01:12:27.097
I'm the one that sold her
that car that she's driving.

01:12:27.097 --> 01:12:28.741
Okay.

01:12:28.741 --> 01:12:30.720
So, that's an interesting
way to meet someone.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.887
Yeah, it is.

01:12:32.782 --> 01:12:34.664
So, if you ever need to
buy a car or you're lookin'

01:12:34.664 --> 01:12:36.803
to buy one, I'm the guy to talk to.

01:12:36.803 --> 01:12:37.636
Great.

01:12:37.636 --> 01:12:39.339
That's good to know.

01:12:39.339 --> 01:12:41.345
So, how's she doin'?

01:12:41.345 --> 01:12:44.053
I would be fine if my aunt hadn't been

01:12:44.053 --> 01:12:45.786
taking you home that night.

01:12:45.786 --> 01:12:46.619
Leslie.

01:12:46.619 --> 01:12:48.379
She would still be here.

01:12:48.379 --> 01:12:49.212
Come on.

01:12:50.198 --> 01:12:52.806
Leslie, this isn't my fault.

01:12:52.806 --> 01:12:54.907
Just like
nothin is ever your fault.

01:12:54.907 --> 01:12:56.812
Right, Porsche?

01:12:59.491 --> 01:13:00.324
I'm sorry.

01:13:00.324 --> 01:13:01.157
You know what?

01:13:01.157 --> 01:13:02.695
I know that you're angry.

01:13:02.695 --> 01:13:06.593
So I'm gonna leave so
we can keep the peace.

01:13:06.593 --> 01:13:07.707
It was good seeing you.

01:13:07.707 --> 01:13:09.571
Are you gonna be here for a while?

01:13:09.571 --> 01:13:10.404
Bee.

01:13:12.002 --> 01:13:14.933
Actually, I'll be staying
at the hotel near the airport.

01:13:14.933 --> 01:13:15.766
Okay.

01:13:15.766 --> 01:13:17.325
If you need to reach
me, that's my number.

01:13:17.325 --> 01:13:18.158
Okay.

01:13:18.158 --> 01:13:18.991
Thanks, Belinda.

01:13:18.991 --> 01:13:19.824
Charles, nice meeting you.

01:13:19.824 --> 01:13:20.657
Likewise.

01:13:20.657 --> 01:13:23.240
I love you, Leslie.

01:13:26.029 --> 01:13:27.551
You two, seriously?

01:13:27.551 --> 01:13:29.271
- That's your mother.
- I didn't wanna be rude.

01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:30.487
She is not my mother.

01:13:30.487 --> 01:13:32.626
And everything wrong that
has happened in my family

01:13:32.626 --> 01:13:34.126
is because of her.

01:13:36.006 --> 01:13:38.372
I don't understand.

01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:39.205
I don't understand none of this.

01:13:39.205 --> 01:13:41.633
You don't understand what, Charles?

01:13:41.633 --> 01:13:42.739
You can just be nice to her.

01:13:42.739 --> 01:13:43.572
Be nice?

01:13:44.611 --> 01:13:45.910
It's a funeral wake.

01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:50.301
I'm not havin' this
conversation with you.

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:51.168
You know what?

01:13:51.168 --> 01:13:52.661
I know.

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:55.014
We have chemo in the morning, right?

01:13:55.014 --> 01:13:56.124
So, let's just get ready to go home.

01:13:56.124 --> 01:13:56.957
It's okay.

01:13:56.957 --> 01:13:58.984
Look, you know, let me just talk to her.

01:13:58.984 --> 01:14:00.698
And I can take her home.

01:14:00.698 --> 01:14:02.201
No, I got it.

01:14:02.201 --> 01:14:04.252
I can talk to her myself.

01:14:04.252 --> 01:14:05.294
I got this.

01:14:05.294 --> 01:14:08.794
Know what?

01:14:08.794 --> 01:14:10.749
You always do this.
I don't know how you deal

01:14:10.749 --> 01:14:12.082
with him.

01:14:12.082 --> 01:14:13.912
Listen.

01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:16.702
I'll be in the car when you're ready.

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:19.000
You can go home.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.975
I'll be in the car when you're ready.

01:14:22.975 --> 01:14:24.558
They're gone now.

01:14:26.199 --> 01:14:30.755
So, you wanna hang out or
make a move real quick?

01:14:30.755 --> 01:14:31.588
Yeah.

01:14:31.588 --> 01:14:32.421
Make a move?

01:14:32.421 --> 01:14:33.254
Yeah.

01:14:33.254 --> 01:14:34.712
I'm down.

01:14:34.712 --> 01:14:36.712
Let's get up outta here.

01:14:43.481 --> 01:14:44.652
Hey, Nina.

01:14:44.652 --> 01:14:45.587
Hi.

01:14:45.587 --> 01:14:47.559
Hi, is your mom here?

01:14:47.559 --> 01:14:48.726
Yeah.

01:14:53.474 --> 01:14:55.032
Would you like to sit on the couch?

01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:55.865
Sure.

01:14:58.873 --> 01:15:00.350
So, how've you been?

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:01.183
Pretty good.

01:15:01.183 --> 01:15:02.016
How are you?

01:15:02.016 --> 01:15:03.373
Good.

01:15:03.373 --> 01:15:04.706
Nina.

01:15:05.699 --> 01:15:07.308
Seriously?

01:15:07.308 --> 01:15:09.308
What are you doin' here?

01:15:10.796 --> 01:15:12.857
I thought we could talk.

01:15:12.857 --> 01:15:14.263
Nina, baby, go upstairs.

01:15:14.263 --> 01:15:15.596
I wanna stay with Grandma.

01:15:15.596 --> 01:15:16.846
Now.

01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:23.243
Listen, I'm sorry.

01:15:23.243 --> 01:15:24.076
I called.

01:15:24.076 --> 01:15:25.624
I tried to reach you, but.

01:15:25.624 --> 01:15:27.221
I didn't know what else to do.

01:15:27.221 --> 01:15:30.147
I wasn't answerin' on purpose.

01:15:30.147 --> 01:15:31.554
What is it that you need
to talk about so badly

01:15:31.554 --> 01:15:34.304
that you will pop up at my house?

01:15:38.766 --> 01:15:41.735
Leslie, I know that you and
I are not in this good place.

01:15:41.735 --> 01:15:45.318
And, honestly, I don't
know where to start.

01:15:47.389 --> 01:15:48.806
I know about the-

01:15:50.759 --> 01:15:52.869
I know about the cancer.

01:15:52.869 --> 01:15:54.147
Rene told me.

01:15:54.147 --> 01:15:55.860
We were just starting to talk again.

01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:58.696
What does that have to do with me?

01:15:58.696 --> 01:15:59.529
You're my daughter.

01:15:59.529 --> 01:16:00.774
I love you.

01:16:00.774 --> 01:16:01.931
I came here to help.

01:16:01.931 --> 01:16:02.764
Help?

01:16:03.824 --> 01:16:06.415
Oh, now you wanna help?

01:16:06.415 --> 01:16:09.086
The only woman that ever
cared about me is gone.

01:16:09.086 --> 01:16:11.214
And, now you wanna help?

01:16:11.214 --> 01:16:13.790
Where you been all these years?

01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:14.623
Where?

01:16:15.862 --> 01:16:18.437
When I broke my leg, where were you?

01:16:18.437 --> 01:16:21.370
When I got beat up at school
and had to get stitches?

01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:22.620
Where were you?

01:16:24.448 --> 01:16:25.300
High school graduation.

01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.875
Hell, college graduation?

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:30.030
And, now, because I'm sick,
I'm supposed to welcome you

01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:31.806
with open arms?

01:16:33.094 --> 01:16:34.858
You know what you can do?

01:16:34.858 --> 01:16:36.879
Go back to wherever you came from.

01:16:36.879 --> 01:16:39.212
Help me by leavin' me alone.

01:16:40.912 --> 01:16:44.466
Leslie, I didn't come here to fight you.

01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:47.084
There's so much you don't know and-

01:16:47.084 --> 01:16:49.917
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

01:16:55.091 --> 01:16:56.508
Okay.

01:16:59.122 --> 01:17:01.715
But, here's my number just
in case you need to call me.

01:17:01.715 --> 01:17:02.798
Day or night.

01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:07.146
I'm not goin' anywhere.

01:17:50.254 --> 01:17:51.184
Look at me.

01:17:51.184 --> 01:17:52.017
Look at this.

01:17:52.017 --> 01:17:53.079
Why are you so damn mad?

01:17:53.079 --> 01:17:53.912
Look at this.

01:17:53.912 --> 01:17:55.067
Look at my shirt.

01:17:55.067 --> 01:17:55.900
Really, Charles?

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:56.733
The car.

01:17:56.733 --> 01:17:57.691
This is disgusting.

01:17:57.691 --> 01:18:00.557
I asked you how did you
feel when we got in the car.

01:18:00.557 --> 01:18:01.390
What'd you tell me?

01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:02.223
You said that you were fine-
When you asked me,

01:18:02.223 --> 01:18:04.067
I said I was fine!

01:18:04.067 --> 01:18:04.900
And, look at this.

01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:06.671
Obviously, you're not fine.

01:18:06.671 --> 01:18:07.679
I thought I was.

01:18:07.679 --> 01:18:08.512
I'm sorry.

01:18:08.512 --> 01:18:09.345
What you want me to do?

01:18:09.345 --> 01:18:10.791
You can get that shit clean.

01:18:12.891 --> 01:18:13.859
I'm gettin' tired.

01:18:13.859 --> 01:18:14.692
Ti-

01:18:14.692 --> 01:18:15.525
You tired?

01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:16.535
I'm gettin' tired.

01:18:16.535 --> 01:18:18.074
I'm gettin' really fed up with this.

01:18:18.074 --> 01:18:18.907
- Charles.
- I go to work all-

01:18:18.907 --> 01:18:21.424
You know I get
sick after my treatments.

01:18:21.424 --> 01:18:22.751
I asked you how did you feel.

01:18:22.751 --> 01:18:23.992
I could've pulled over.

01:18:23.992 --> 01:18:24.825
Now, look.

01:18:24.825 --> 01:18:25.658
What you want me to do?

01:18:25.658 --> 01:18:27.449
Hold it in?
Yeah, something!

01:18:27.449 --> 01:18:29.569
Not all over me!

01:18:29.569 --> 01:18:30.784
- It was a accident.
- I clean.

01:18:30.784 --> 01:18:32.114
Cook.

01:18:32.114 --> 01:18:33.840
Obviously, obviously.
Oh, wow.

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.647
So you mad 'cause you gotta step up?

01:18:35.647 --> 01:18:37.761
I do everything around here.

01:18:37.761 --> 01:18:38.868
Everything.

01:18:38.868 --> 01:18:40.324
And, so what do I do?

01:18:40.324 --> 01:18:42.364
You act like I asked to be sick.

01:18:42.364 --> 01:18:43.711
You ain't the only one.

01:18:43.711 --> 01:18:45.894
And what the hell is
that supposed to mean?

01:18:45.894 --> 01:18:47.531
You ain't the only one that had cancer.

01:18:47.531 --> 01:18:48.364
Oh.

01:18:49.588 --> 01:18:51.402
I'm goin' upstairs.

01:18:51.402 --> 01:18:54.262
You bein' real stupid right now.

01:19:03.723 --> 01:19:05.324
Babe?

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:06.157
What you doin'?

01:19:06.157 --> 01:19:08.157
Why you have your stuff?

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:15.635
I realized that
I'm not the man for you.

01:19:15.635 --> 01:19:16.468
Charles.

01:19:16.468 --> 01:19:17.301
Charles.
I thought I was.

01:19:17.301 --> 01:19:18.898
I thought I could do all this.

01:19:18.898 --> 01:19:20.956
And take care of everything.

01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:21.789
And work.

01:19:21.789 --> 01:19:22.779
And take care of Nina.

01:19:22.779 --> 01:19:24.196
Take care of you.

01:19:25.688 --> 01:19:26.713
But, you are, though.

01:19:26.713 --> 01:19:27.579
You've been helping me.

01:19:27.579 --> 01:19:28.748
What do you?

01:19:28.748 --> 01:19:30.886
You are the man I need.

01:19:30.886 --> 01:19:31.897
No.

01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:33.612
You're doin' it.

01:19:33.612 --> 01:19:34.779
No, I'm not.

01:19:36.477 --> 01:19:38.323
Leslie, I'm suffocating.

01:19:38.323 --> 01:19:40.275
Suffocating?

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:41.108
Babe.

01:19:41.108 --> 01:19:42.260
This is too much.

01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:43.510
No, it's not.

01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:47.986
Leslie, I'm leaving you.

01:19:47.986 --> 01:19:48.819
No.

01:19:48.819 --> 01:19:49.885
I've gotta go.

01:19:49.885 --> 01:19:51.175
Charles.

01:19:51.175 --> 01:19:52.293
It's fine.

01:19:52.293 --> 01:19:53.488
Just.

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:54.897
Leslie, I'm leavin' you.
It's not fine.

01:19:54.897 --> 01:19:56.355
Come on, I'll put this away for you.

01:19:56.355 --> 01:19:57.654
Stop, stop.

01:19:57.654 --> 01:19:58.487
Stop.

01:19:58.487 --> 01:19:59.445
Just stop.

01:19:59.445 --> 01:20:00.278
Just stop.

01:20:00.278 --> 01:20:01.111
Listen.

01:20:01.111 --> 01:20:01.944
It's not.

01:20:01.944 --> 01:20:02.777
Listen.

01:20:02.777 --> 01:20:03.610
I can't do this.

01:20:03.610 --> 01:20:04.443
Yes you can.

01:20:04.443 --> 01:20:05.276
You've been doing it.

01:20:05.276 --> 01:20:07.251
You can't leave me.

01:20:07.251 --> 01:20:08.292
I don't know how to do this.

01:20:08.292 --> 01:20:09.763
I can't do this by myself.

01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:10.721
I need you.

01:20:10.721 --> 01:20:11.709
No you don't.

01:20:11.709 --> 01:20:12.542
Please?

01:20:12.542 --> 01:20:13.375
Come on, let's go put your stuff down.

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.208
Just stop.

01:20:14.208 --> 01:20:15.041
Just stop.

01:20:15.041 --> 01:20:15.874
Just stop.

01:20:15.874 --> 01:20:17.296
Stop.

01:20:17.296 --> 01:20:18.823
Babe.

01:20:18.823 --> 01:20:19.675
It's not okay.

01:20:19.675 --> 01:20:20.997
I can't keep doin' this.

01:20:20.997 --> 01:20:21.830
Yes, you can.

01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:22.663
No, I can't.

01:20:22.663 --> 01:20:23.496
I need you to help out.

01:20:23.496 --> 01:20:24.941
Please.
I'm suffocating.

01:20:24.941 --> 01:20:25.774
You're not.

01:20:25.774 --> 01:20:26.607
Yes I am.

01:20:26.607 --> 01:20:27.440
I've gotta go.

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.398
But I'm gonna get better

01:20:28.398 --> 01:20:30.871
and we gonna get through this together.

01:20:30.871 --> 01:20:32.791
This not supposed to break us.

01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:36.835
You supposed to be with me.

01:20:36.835 --> 01:20:37.668
No, no.

01:20:39.396 --> 01:20:40.229
Babe, come on.

01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:41.062
I'm gonna get better.

01:20:41.062 --> 01:20:41.895
I promise.

01:20:44.145 --> 01:20:45.591
After the treatments, I'm gonna do more.

01:20:45.591 --> 01:20:47.826
I'm gonna help you out
with Nina so you don't have

01:20:47.826 --> 01:20:50.243
to do everything by yourself.

01:20:51.508 --> 01:20:52.341
No.

01:20:53.547 --> 01:20:54.505
Get your key.

01:20:54.505 --> 01:20:55.452
Stop.

01:20:55.452 --> 01:20:56.285
No.

01:20:56.285 --> 01:20:58.681
Stop, stop, stop!

01:20:58.681 --> 01:21:00.080
I need you.

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:00.913
Charles.

01:21:02.254 --> 01:21:05.286
I can't do this without you.

01:21:05.286 --> 01:21:06.119
Stop.

01:21:06.119 --> 01:21:06.952
No.

01:21:15.857 --> 01:21:16.690

Belinda.

01:23:35.785 --> 01:23:37.118
Charles is gone.

01:23:41.948 --> 01:23:43.956
Somethin' about he.

01:23:43.956 --> 01:23:47.039
Somethin' about he can't put anymore.

01:24:07.623 --> 01:24:08.456
What happened?

01:24:08.456 --> 01:24:09.728
Where's Leslie?

01:24:09.728 --> 01:24:11.955
She's in the emergency room.

01:24:11.955 --> 01:24:12.926
They're pumpin' her stomach.

01:24:12.926 --> 01:24:13.759
She's.

01:24:15.511 --> 01:24:18.991
She took an overdose on sleeping pills.

01:24:18.991 --> 01:24:20.242
Why would she do that?

01:24:20.242 --> 01:24:22.014
Where's Charles?

01:24:22.014 --> 01:24:23.931
He walked out on her.

01:24:25.828 --> 01:24:28.626
Between the cancer and Rene dyin'.

01:24:28.626 --> 01:24:31.543
And now Charles walkin' out on her.

01:24:32.690 --> 01:24:34.617
It's too much for her.

01:24:34.617 --> 01:24:37.842
You know, I thought
Charles could handle it.

01:24:37.842 --> 01:24:39.780
I knew I shoulda been
payin' more attention.

01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:41.899
I should just follow my
instinct and just been there.

01:24:41.899 --> 01:24:43.577
I just been so busy with work.

01:24:43.577 --> 01:24:44.410
I just-

01:24:45.401 --> 01:24:46.856
I shoulda been there for her.
No, no, no, no.

01:24:46.856 --> 01:24:48.169
You can't blame yourself.

01:24:48.169 --> 01:24:49.002
Look.

01:24:49.002 --> 01:24:51.552
We all go through stages where
we go back and forth with

01:24:51.552 --> 01:24:55.552
we shoulda done this, we
shoulda done that, but.

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:57.293
Baby, I know.

01:24:57.293 --> 01:24:58.437
I spent most of my life.

01:24:58.437 --> 01:25:00.193
That's not the way that this works.

01:25:00.193 --> 01:25:02.693
You can't do that to yourself.

01:25:05.972 --> 01:25:06.805
How's Nina?

01:25:06.805 --> 01:25:09.480
Does she know anything?

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:10.791
She's scared.

01:25:10.791 --> 01:25:14.124
She doesn't really know what's goin' on.

01:25:26.106 --> 01:25:28.052
Hi, Leslie.

01:25:28.052 --> 01:25:29.219
How you doin'?

01:25:30.187 --> 01:25:31.719
What're you doin' here?

01:25:31.719 --> 01:25:33.698
Where's Belinda?

01:25:33.698 --> 01:25:35.839
Belinda's out front with Nina.

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:38.473
They let me back here
because I'm your mother.

01:25:38.473 --> 01:25:39.507
Well, I'm alive.

01:25:39.507 --> 01:25:41.007
So you can go now.

01:25:44.382 --> 01:25:45.340
Look.

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:46.173
Leslie.

01:25:46.173 --> 01:25:51.090
I'm here now and sooner or
later, we're gonna have to talk.

01:25:55.833 --> 01:25:57.583
I'm glad you're okay.

01:26:02.139 --> 01:26:03.806
I'll go get Belinda.

01:26:06.347 --> 01:26:07.995
I wanna take Nina with me
while you're in the hospital.

01:26:07.995 --> 01:26:11.765
Will you, at least, let me
spend some time with her?

01:26:11.765 --> 01:26:15.932
She can go with you, but
only while I'm in here.

01:26:19.114 --> 01:26:22.531
After that, I want you to leave us alone.

01:26:25.278 --> 01:26:26.278
Thank you.

01:26:27.302 --> 01:26:28.885
We'll be at Rene's.

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:34.897
Leslie, girl, what's wrong with you?

01:26:34.897 --> 01:26:37.647
I'm glad you called when you did.

01:26:39.218 --> 01:26:40.630
Are you tryin' to kill yourself for a man?

01:26:40.630 --> 01:26:41.788
Like-

01:26:41.788 --> 01:26:42.621
I know.

01:26:42.621 --> 01:26:43.602
I'm just.

01:26:43.602 --> 01:26:45.708
I guess I was so devastated
because of the way

01:26:45.708 --> 01:26:47.392
he walked out.

01:26:47.392 --> 01:26:50.447
Like, Bee, why would he just
walk out on me the way he did?

01:26:50.447 --> 01:26:52.172
Knowin' everything I'm going through?

01:26:52.172 --> 01:26:53.005
Listen.

01:26:53.921 --> 01:26:57.336
Any man that'll walk out
on you in a time like this?

01:26:57.336 --> 01:26:59.328
Ain't the man that you need.

01:26:59.328 --> 01:27:00.161
Okay?

01:27:00.161 --> 01:27:01.584
Don't even worry about him.

01:27:01.584 --> 01:27:03.011
But me and Charles was sup-

01:27:03.011 --> 01:27:03.844
No.

01:27:03.844 --> 01:27:05.414
Ain't no "me and Charles", okay?

01:27:05.414 --> 01:27:06.441
Don't worry about that.

01:27:06.441 --> 01:27:08.004
I got you, okay?

01:27:08.004 --> 01:27:09.593
You need to get some rest.

01:27:09.593 --> 01:27:11.616
That's what you need to do.

01:27:11.616 --> 01:27:13.449
Now, you're mama out here,
tryin' to take Nina with her.

01:27:13.449 --> 01:27:16.937
God, that woman won't quit.

01:27:16.937 --> 01:27:19.245
That woman just won't quit.

01:27:19.245 --> 01:27:20.662
Nah, she won't.

01:27:21.725 --> 01:27:23.513
So what you wanna do?

01:27:23.513 --> 01:27:25.004
You can go ahead and let her take her.

01:27:25.004 --> 01:27:27.925
I mean, I could take her
with me and show properties

01:27:27.925 --> 01:27:29.490
with me, whatever.

01:27:29.490 --> 01:27:30.915
No, you gotta go to work.

01:27:30.915 --> 01:27:32.329
Just let her take her.

01:27:32.329 --> 01:27:33.859
But do me a favor and go
to my house and get Nina

01:27:33.859 --> 01:27:34.841
some clothes?

01:27:34.841 --> 01:27:38.647
At least enough to last
'til I get outta here.

01:27:38.647 --> 01:27:40.467
All right.

01:27:40.467 --> 01:27:41.300
I'll go get 'em.

01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:42.133
Just Nina.

01:27:42.133 --> 01:27:44.245
Stay outta my closet.

01:27:44.245 --> 01:27:45.078
But.

01:27:46.448 --> 01:27:47.619
Why I gotta stay outta the closet?

01:27:47.619 --> 01:27:49.565
It's only like one thing that I wanna get.

01:27:49.565 --> 01:27:51.885
I'm just gonna go get Nina some clothes.

01:27:51.885 --> 01:27:53.212
Bee, seriously?

01:27:53.212 --> 01:27:54.258
Come on.

01:27:54.258 --> 01:27:56.315
No, 'cause you don't
like to give stuff back.

01:27:56.315 --> 01:27:59.062
I'm gonna stay outta your closet, okay?

01:27:59.062 --> 01:27:59.895
All right.

01:27:59.895 --> 01:28:04.355
So get some rest and I'm
gonna go get Nina situated.

01:28:04.355 --> 01:28:06.764
And I'ma call and check on you tomorrow.

01:28:06.764 --> 01:28:07.856
All right?

01:28:07.856 --> 01:28:08.689
All right.

01:28:08.689 --> 01:28:09.522
I love you.

01:28:09.522 --> 01:28:10.355
I love you too.

01:28:10.355 --> 01:28:11.188
All right.

01:28:11.188 --> 01:28:12.626
See you later.

01:28:12.626 --> 01:28:16.530
I'm gon' be givin' these
people hell out there.

01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:17.363
Nina?

01:28:17.363 --> 01:28:18.437
Are you getting ready?

01:28:18.437 --> 01:28:20.770
Yes, Grandma, I'm dressed.

01:28:22.227 --> 01:28:23.310
Look at you.

01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:24.914
Okay.

01:28:24.914 --> 01:28:28.053
I can't wait to get my hands on this hair.

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:29.406
Can I ask you a question?

01:28:29.406 --> 01:28:31.768
Yes, sweetheart, you
can ask me anything.

01:28:31.768 --> 01:28:33.784
Where have you been all this time?

01:28:33.784 --> 01:28:36.509
My mom never told me about you.

01:28:36.509 --> 01:28:39.183
Well.

01:28:39.183 --> 01:28:40.668
Actually, I think that's a conversation

01:28:40.668 --> 01:28:43.091
that you and your mother should have.

01:28:43.091 --> 01:28:44.274
Why can't we talk about it?

01:28:44.274 --> 01:28:47.836
My mom always tells me everything.

01:28:47.836 --> 01:28:49.132
I think that it's great
that you and your mother

01:28:49.132 --> 01:28:52.406
talk to each other about
everything, but grandmothers?

01:28:52.406 --> 01:28:53.894
Not so much.

01:28:53.894 --> 01:28:56.281
You and Auntie Rene are just alike.

01:28:56.281 --> 01:28:58.956
You never tell me anything.

01:28:59.939 --> 01:29:02.106
Well, that is my sister.

01:29:04.393 --> 01:29:06.121
Well, good
morning, young lady.

01:29:06.121 --> 01:29:08.892
How are you feelin' today?

01:29:08.892 --> 01:29:10.214
Tired.

01:29:10.214 --> 01:29:11.975
Empty inside.

01:29:11.975 --> 01:29:13.548
Hm.

01:29:13.548 --> 01:29:15.359
So, uh, tell me what happened.

01:29:15.359 --> 01:29:17.864
How'd you end up in here?

01:29:17.864 --> 01:29:19.520
I don't know what happened.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.436
It's all a blur.

01:29:21.436 --> 01:29:24.186
A bad dream I can't wake up from.

01:29:25.996 --> 01:29:28.537
It's like one minute,
you're on top of the world.

01:29:28.537 --> 01:29:32.451
And the next, the world is on top of you.

01:29:32.451 --> 01:29:33.701
My aunt's gone.

01:29:34.816 --> 01:29:37.443
She's not comin' back.

01:29:37.443 --> 01:29:40.012
My boyfriend walked out on me.

01:29:40.012 --> 01:29:42.045
We were supposed to get married.

01:29:42.045 --> 01:29:43.887
Hm.

01:29:43.887 --> 01:29:46.000
Well, I understand.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.897
Things can be a bit overwhelming right now

01:29:47.897 --> 01:29:49.279
and you're goin' through
a very difficult time

01:29:49.279 --> 01:29:50.329
in your life right now.

01:29:50.329 --> 01:29:53.093
So, what I'm going to do is
recommend you to somebody I know

01:29:53.093 --> 01:29:54.997
by the name of Dr. Jakes.

01:29:54.997 --> 01:29:57.653
She's a clinical psychologist
who specializes in women

01:29:57.653 --> 01:30:00.124
with breast cancer and I
really think she could be

01:30:00.124 --> 01:30:02.137
a good help to you right
now with your depression

01:30:02.137 --> 01:30:03.397
and, you know, everything that you're

01:30:03.397 --> 01:30:05.314
dealing with right now.

01:30:06.230 --> 01:30:09.327
If that's what you suggest, Dr. Myles.

01:30:09.327 --> 01:30:11.728
Pretty sure it could help.

01:30:11.728 --> 01:30:15.895
Let me go ahead and get
her in for you, all right?

01:30:26.531 --> 01:30:29.705
Good afternoon, Leslie.

01:30:29.705 --> 01:30:30.872
I'm Dr. Jakes.

01:30:36.137 --> 01:30:38.441
Dr. Myles referred you to me.

01:30:38.441 --> 01:30:39.808
Can we talk for just a moment?

01:30:39.808 --> 01:30:41.475
Yeah, we can talk.

01:30:46.089 --> 01:30:49.129
Now, I did review your medical records

01:30:49.129 --> 01:30:52.204
and I am aware what you're facin'.

01:30:52.204 --> 01:30:55.865
But what I don't know is what
happened to make you take

01:30:55.865 --> 01:30:57.198
all those pills?

01:30:59.769 --> 01:31:01.206
It's like everything that could go wrong

01:31:01.206 --> 01:31:04.289
in a woman's life went wrong in mine.

01:31:05.519 --> 01:31:10.269
If there is a God in Heaven,
why does He hate me so much?

01:31:12.335 --> 01:31:15.059
I understand how you're feelin'.

01:31:15.059 --> 01:31:17.534
And I do believe in God and
I don't think he's angry

01:31:17.534 --> 01:31:20.128
at you, but, more importantly,
what do you think you

01:31:20.128 --> 01:31:22.614
could have possibly done
for God to be angry at you?

01:31:22.614 --> 01:31:23.864
I don't know.

01:31:26.357 --> 01:31:28.126
Maybe not believe in Him enough?

01:31:28.126 --> 01:31:30.809
Not go to church enough?

01:31:30.809 --> 01:31:33.030
You know, this whole talking
thing is not gonna solve

01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:34.371
my problems.

01:31:34.371 --> 01:31:36.651
It's not gonna bring my
aunt back, my boyfriend,

01:31:36.651 --> 01:31:39.030
and it damn sure ain't
gonna cure my cancer.

01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:40.447
I only agreed to this
because Dr. Myles said

01:31:40.447 --> 01:31:42.095
I need to talk to you.

01:31:42.095 --> 01:31:44.163
But I really don't think you're
the one that's the answer

01:31:44.163 --> 01:31:45.413
to my problems.

01:31:46.298 --> 01:31:49.994
Well, I do think Dr. Myles is right.

01:31:49.994 --> 01:31:51.919
I do think you need to speak with someone

01:31:51.919 --> 01:31:55.493
and I happen to be a good listener.

01:31:55.493 --> 01:31:57.180
And, Leslie, I'm not here to judge you.

01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:00.300
Only to help you figure out
what's goin' on inside you

01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:03.050
to make you wanna take your life.

01:32:03.947 --> 01:32:05.202
I don't think it's the cancer

01:32:05.202 --> 01:32:06.453
and I don't think it's the loss.

01:32:06.453 --> 01:32:10.036
But there is definitely
something goin' on.

01:32:11.288 --> 01:32:15.295
Now, if we get together
and we can figure this out,

01:32:15.295 --> 01:32:19.378
step-by-step, are you
willing to do that, Leslie?

01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:25.976
I know this is hard what
you're going through.

01:32:25.976 --> 01:32:28.859
I know this is really hard.

01:32:28.859 --> 01:32:32.859
But I think some counseling
can really help you.

01:32:34.045 --> 01:32:34.878
Leslie?

01:32:42.767 --> 01:32:45.184
How are you doing, Porsche?

01:32:46.917 --> 01:32:49.191
God, it's been difficult.

01:32:49.191 --> 01:32:51.387
It's been so difficult.

01:32:51.387 --> 01:32:53.276
Well, Porsche, my job
is try to help uplift

01:32:53.276 --> 01:32:55.688
some of these burdens off of you.

01:32:55.688 --> 01:32:58.188
My hope is to bring you peace.

01:32:59.513 --> 01:33:00.659
Okay.

01:33:00.659 --> 01:33:03.051
So, when did you start
havin' this pain in your life

01:33:03.051 --> 01:33:05.551
that you can vividly remember?

01:33:06.689 --> 01:33:10.207
From the time my mother's
boyfriend started raping me

01:33:10.207 --> 01:33:12.870
through the time my sister passed away,

01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:14.668
my life has been difficult.

01:33:14.668 --> 01:33:15.887
Painful.

01:33:19.343 --> 01:33:21.480
But, the most painful part
about it was not havin'

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:22.480
my daughter.

01:33:23.852 --> 01:33:25.554
Let's start with that.

01:33:25.554 --> 01:33:28.137
How 'bout we talk about Leslie?

01:33:32.828 --> 01:33:35.554
She was three years old
when I went to prison.

01:33:35.554 --> 01:33:38.804
And, by the time I got out, she was 19.

01:33:40.136 --> 01:33:41.170
Beautiful.

01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:43.767
In college.

01:33:44.948 --> 01:33:46.031
And pregnant.

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:52.300
We got in this huge argument
and really haven't spoke since.

01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:54.800
What was the argument about?

01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.893
She was pregnant by a married man.

01:33:59.893 --> 01:34:02.726
And he abandoned her and the baby.

01:34:03.646 --> 01:34:05.400
I didn't want that for her, you know?

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:09.820
I wanted her to have a
career and get married.

01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:11.931
And then have kids, you know?

01:34:11.931 --> 01:34:13.029
That's understandable.

01:34:13.029 --> 01:34:14.696
So, I blamed Rene.

01:34:17.728 --> 01:34:20.645
We all got into this huge fight and

01:34:22.358 --> 01:34:25.441
I felt abandoned by my sister, again,

01:34:26.378 --> 01:34:27.593
and rejected by my daughter.

01:34:27.593 --> 01:34:28.510
So I moved.

01:34:29.677 --> 01:34:32.260
That's when I moved to Oakland.

01:34:33.542 --> 01:34:36.122
By the time I reached out to Leslie,

01:34:36.122 --> 01:34:41.122
she cut me off the same way
Rene did when I went to prison.

01:34:41.821 --> 01:34:44.988
Were you and your sister ever close?

01:34:46.885 --> 01:34:49.135
In the beginning we were.

01:34:50.522 --> 01:34:53.594
I don't remember my dad,
but what I do remember is

01:34:53.594 --> 01:34:55.958
my mom's boyfriend.

01:34:55.958 --> 01:34:57.458
He was this drunk.

01:34:58.995 --> 01:34:59.828
Alcoholic.

01:34:59.828 --> 01:35:00.911
Just abusive,

01:35:03.858 --> 01:35:04.941
horrible man.

01:35:06.721 --> 01:35:09.638
So, when Rene turned 18, she moved out.

01:35:09.638 --> 01:35:14.638
I mean, I don't blame her, you
know, but, she left me there.

01:35:15.386 --> 01:35:19.136
She was my best friend
and she left me there.

01:35:23.195 --> 01:35:26.150
That's when he started raping me.

01:35:26.150 --> 01:35:27.261
You have to tell your daughter

01:35:27.261 --> 01:35:29.382
what happened in this family.

01:35:29.382 --> 01:35:30.215
No.

01:35:30.215 --> 01:35:31.992
You have to tell her everything.

01:35:31.992 --> 01:35:32.825
No.

01:35:32.825 --> 01:35:34.718
That's the only way you're
gonna break this cycle

01:35:34.718 --> 01:35:36.226
of broken women.

01:35:36.226 --> 01:35:38.637
I'm not comfortable
with tellin' her this.

01:35:38.637 --> 01:35:40.785
And, besides, I don't see
the point in bringing anymore

01:35:40.785 --> 01:35:43.768
mess and drama in her life.

01:35:43.768 --> 01:35:46.722
The point is she needs to know.

01:35:46.722 --> 01:35:48.405
And here's why.

01:35:48.405 --> 01:35:52.907
There cannot be complete
healing with things covered up.

01:35:52.907 --> 01:35:55.514
It brings erosion to the
foundation of the family

01:35:55.514 --> 01:35:57.741
with such secrecy.

01:35:57.741 --> 01:35:59.810
Now, other private matters
of the family, yes.

01:35:59.810 --> 01:36:00.875
Of course, there are.

01:36:00.875 --> 01:36:03.974
But, when it comes to
paternity, illness, abuse.

01:36:03.974 --> 01:36:06.807
Those things need to be discussed.

01:36:09.082 --> 01:36:10.715
Well.

01:36:10.715 --> 01:36:11.548
You know what?

01:36:11.548 --> 01:36:12.381
I don't think now's the time.

01:36:12.381 --> 01:36:14.738
I think we should wait.

01:36:14.738 --> 01:36:17.019
Right now, she's not
emotionally or physically strong

01:36:17.019 --> 01:36:18.569
enough to deal with this.

01:36:18.569 --> 01:36:20.451
I think
she's a lot stronger than

01:36:20.451 --> 01:36:22.868
what you give her credit for.

01:36:26.583 --> 01:36:28.087
What about Nina?

01:36:28.087 --> 01:36:29.504
How's that going?

01:36:32.736 --> 01:36:34.819
Nina is this beautiful,

01:36:36.573 --> 01:36:39.249
intelligent, energetic,

01:36:39.249 --> 01:36:40.249
little girl.

01:36:42.932 --> 01:36:46.599
God, I missed so much
of her life, you know?

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.938
I don't want what happened
with Leslie to happen with her.

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:55.938
I mean, I really wanna be
a bigger part of her life.

01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:59.517
That is why I'm here to help you.

01:36:59.517 --> 01:37:01.381
But it's gonna take the
both of you to come together

01:37:01.381 --> 01:37:05.749
and discuss the things
that are uncomfortable.

01:37:05.749 --> 01:37:06.582
I know.

01:37:08.615 --> 01:37:09.556
I don't know how to do that.

01:37:09.556 --> 01:37:11.973
I mean, she's so angry at me.

01:37:13.213 --> 01:37:16.099
Let's just get you together.

01:37:16.099 --> 01:37:19.232
'Cause it's time for this
family to get some healing.

01:37:19.232 --> 01:37:20.065
Okay?

01:37:21.482 --> 01:37:22.315
Okay.

01:37:26.653 --> 01:37:29.014
Hello Leslie, Porsche.

01:37:29.014 --> 01:37:30.607
I'm glad you two are here.

01:37:30.607 --> 01:37:32.903
Good to see you, Dr. Jakes.

01:37:32.903 --> 01:37:35.347
Can we just get this over with?

01:37:35.347 --> 01:37:37.987
Let me start off by
sayin' that the both of you

01:37:37.987 --> 01:37:41.654
have been through a
great deal of heartache.

01:37:42.522 --> 01:37:44.582
I brought the both of you
here at the same time,

01:37:44.582 --> 01:37:47.971
because there has been a cycle
of generational dysfunction

01:37:47.971 --> 01:37:49.804
that has to be broken.

01:37:50.887 --> 01:37:53.813
And the only way that can
happen is if you talk about it

01:37:53.813 --> 01:37:56.813
and confront the issues as a family.

01:37:57.665 --> 01:38:01.159
We have to uncover these family secrets.

01:38:01.159 --> 01:38:05.491
And that means you have
to be open and honest.

01:38:05.491 --> 01:38:10.158
'Cause that's the only way
we're gonna get true healing.

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.870
Why don't we start with you, Porsche?

01:38:13.870 --> 01:38:15.876
Start with me how?

01:38:15.876 --> 01:38:17.213
I thought you were gonna
be the one talkin'.

01:38:17.213 --> 01:38:19.658
What do you want me to say?

01:38:22.159 --> 01:38:24.170
I want you to turn to
your daughter and tell her

01:38:24.170 --> 01:38:26.330
everything that happened to you.

01:38:26.330 --> 01:38:27.247
Everything.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.780
Leslie.

01:38:42.794 --> 01:38:45.544
My mother had a boyfriend who was

01:38:47.010 --> 01:38:49.093
an alcoholic and abusive.

01:38:51.699 --> 01:38:52.532
And.

01:38:54.503 --> 01:38:58.253
When I was 13, she was
diagnosed with cancer.

01:38:59.238 --> 01:39:01.588
Which is the same cancer
her sister died from,

01:39:01.588 --> 01:39:03.489
the same cancer I had.

01:39:03.489 --> 01:39:05.572
The same cancer you have.

01:39:08.499 --> 01:39:11.666
A year later, she was very, very sick.

01:39:14.441 --> 01:39:17.735
And, um.

01:39:17.735 --> 01:39:20.735
That's when he started molesting me.

01:39:28.109 --> 01:39:31.442
One day I came home from school and, uh,

01:39:32.889 --> 01:39:36.222
he was drunk and passed out on the sofa.

01:39:37.524 --> 01:39:40.024
And I went to check on my mom.

01:39:42.935 --> 01:39:46.164
And she had died in her sleep.

01:39:50.279 --> 01:39:53.362
That's when I went to live with Rene.

01:39:56.262 --> 01:39:57.929
Rene was frustrated.

01:39:59.386 --> 01:40:01.354
I mean, we didn't get along.

01:40:01.354 --> 01:40:02.187
At all.

01:40:02.187 --> 01:40:04.104
We fought all the time.

01:40:06.346 --> 01:40:09.236
I started hangin' out
with the wrong crowd,

01:40:09.236 --> 01:40:14.069
I dropped out of school, and
then I got pregnant with you.

01:40:19.742 --> 01:40:20.909
When I was 18,

01:40:23.223 --> 01:40:25.931
for my birthday, I was
gettin' ready to go out

01:40:25.931 --> 01:40:30.893
with some friends and we
stopped at the corner store.

01:40:30.893 --> 01:40:35.603
And our boyfriends went
in to get us some beer.

01:40:35.603 --> 01:40:37.683
And when they tried to
steal it, the store owner

01:40:37.683 --> 01:40:39.266
tried to stop them.

01:40:40.121 --> 01:40:41.621
There was a fight.

01:40:43.069 --> 01:40:44.569
And he got killed.

01:40:46.528 --> 01:40:48.365
I mean, we didn't know what
they were plannin' on doin',

01:40:48.365 --> 01:40:50.115
but it didn't matter.

01:40:52.048 --> 01:40:54.631
We all went to jail for murder.

01:41:00.561 --> 01:41:03.144
Rene didn't even come to court.

01:41:04.012 --> 01:41:06.512
I wrote her to try to explain.

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:11.053
I wrote her to ask for
some pictures of you,

01:41:11.053 --> 01:41:12.636
how you were doin'.

01:41:15.315 --> 01:41:17.315
I begged her to see you.

01:41:19.364 --> 01:41:21.697
And she never wrote me back.

01:41:25.573 --> 01:41:27.832
She never wrote me.

01:41:27.832 --> 01:41:29.832
She never wrote me back.

01:41:36.038 --> 01:41:36.871
Porsche.

01:41:39.007 --> 01:41:42.757
I'm so sorry for everything
you went through.

01:41:44.624 --> 01:41:45.541
And oh God.

01:41:51.314 --> 01:41:52.647
I feel horrible.

01:41:53.949 --> 01:41:57.187
I really hope you can forgive me for it.

01:41:57.187 --> 01:41:59.193
I was so mean to you.

01:41:59.193 --> 01:42:00.026
Oh my God.

01:42:01.967 --> 01:42:03.755
I wanna fix this.

01:42:03.755 --> 01:42:07.505
Baby, there's
nothin' to forgive.

01:42:09.224 --> 01:42:10.966
Don't you understand?

01:42:10.966 --> 01:42:13.484
You're the only thing that
kept me goin', Leslie.

01:42:13.484 --> 01:42:15.775
I thought you didn't want me.

01:42:15.775 --> 01:42:19.348
I wasted all these years hating you.

01:42:19.348 --> 01:42:20.799
I never felt important to you.

01:42:20.799 --> 01:42:21.632
I thought.

01:42:23.846 --> 01:42:26.929
I just thought you didn't want a kid.

01:42:27.833 --> 01:42:31.762
You're the
only thing I ever wanted.

01:42:31.762 --> 01:42:36.429
God, Leslie, I'm so sorry
that I made you feel that way.

01:42:37.564 --> 01:42:42.564
It's only because of you that
I got through everything.

01:42:42.771 --> 01:42:46.598
And I, after all I've been through,

01:42:46.598 --> 01:42:50.262
I remember I used to dream about my mother

01:42:50.262 --> 01:42:53.321
wrappin' her arms around me.

01:42:53.321 --> 01:42:55.620
That's all I ever really wanted.

01:42:55.620 --> 01:43:00.207
I mean, Rene took care of
me, but, she never hugged me.

01:43:06.046 --> 01:43:08.428
There's nothin' to forgive.

01:43:08.428 --> 01:43:11.345
Leslie, there's nothin' to forgive.

01:43:12.192 --> 01:43:14.687
I'm here now, Leslie.

01:43:14.687 --> 01:43:17.270
And I am never gonna leave you.

01:43:18.435 --> 01:43:20.812
I will never leave you again.

01:43:20.812 --> 01:43:21.895
I'm so sorry.

01:43:22.985 --> 01:43:24.068
I'm so sorry.

01:43:30.649 --> 01:43:32.732
Well, what was Grandma like, though?

01:43:32.732 --> 01:43:33.565
Like Rene.

01:44:04.792 --> 01:44:07.503
I have Rene's last
will and testament here.

01:44:07.503 --> 01:44:11.336
She made some changes
just a little while ago.

01:44:13.776 --> 01:44:17.487
It's almost as if she knew
something was gonna happen.

01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:20.175
Rene was a very smart businesswoman.

01:44:20.175 --> 01:44:22.737
She had several million
dollars, including the house,

01:44:22.737 --> 01:44:25.288
and the beauty salon.

01:44:25.288 --> 01:44:26.871
It goes as follows.

01:44:28.592 --> 01:44:32.342
To Leslie, the house
and two million dollars.

01:44:35.439 --> 01:44:40.189
To her grandniece, Nina, one
million dollars for college.

01:44:41.752 --> 01:44:45.585
To be kept in a trust
fund until she turns 18.

01:44:47.955 --> 01:44:49.872
To her sister, Porsche,

01:44:51.163 --> 01:44:54.786
the beauty salon and three million dollars

01:44:54.786 --> 01:44:57.797
from the sale of her properties.

01:44:57.797 --> 01:45:01.964
And you should know that
she was about to disperse

01:45:03.187 --> 01:45:06.854
that money to you right
before the accident.

01:45:10.549 --> 01:45:12.882
My sympathies for your loss.

01:45:14.152 --> 01:45:15.152
Thank you.

01:46:58.832 --> 01:47:00.478
Hi, baby.

01:47:00.478 --> 01:47:01.311
Mommy.

01:47:19.922 --> 01:47:21.310
