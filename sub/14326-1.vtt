13:27.264 --> 13:28.057
Timmy: IT'S OK, MOM.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.684
IT'S JUST A SILLY

IN THEIR PERFECTION.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.746
THEIR TOTAL SUPERIORITY

13:50.829 --> 13:53.290
WILL BE THEIR DOWNFALL!

13:56.835 --> 13:58.170
YOU CAN BEAT THEM, HONEY.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.318
WELL, THEY DO
HAVE A POOL...

14:21.402 --> 14:23.070
AND A NOT-DEAD
