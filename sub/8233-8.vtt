00:01.176 --> 00:02.176
Previously on
Witches of East End.

00:02.209 --> 00:04.509
Forach Deyna!

00:06.174 --> 00:08.141
I don't usually dance
with my friends like this, Dash.

00:08.174 --> 00:10.474
But we're not
just friends, are we?

00:10.508 --> 00:11.708
You're not gonna get rid
of me that easy.

00:11.741 --> 00:13.874
Tommy, I almost
killed you tonight.

00:13.908 --> 00:15.641
Dash, stop!

00:15.674 --> 00:17.208
We have to talk
about my son, Kyle.

00:17.241 --> 00:20.274
Ad mortem, te‐‐

00:20.308 --> 00:22.441
KILLIAN:
This Eva person,
I think she has you

00:22.474 --> 00:25.641
under some sort of spell.
She's using you, man.

00:25.674 --> 00:27.241
She's trying to control you.
You don't love her!

00:27.274 --> 00:28.874
I don't want to hurt you,
Frederick.

00:28.908 --> 00:30.474
I'm here to help you
complete your mission.

00:30.508 --> 00:33.474
We're going to work together...
to bring back the king.

00:34.315 --> 00:37.415
TARKOFF:
What are you waiting for?

00:37.448 --> 00:38.915
This is the third one
we've tried,

00:38.948 --> 00:43.482
and none of
them worked.

00:43.515 --> 00:45.482
(muffled screaming)

00:47.382 --> 00:49.348
(muffled screaming)

00:49.382 --> 00:52.082
Deeper. You have
to cut deeper.

00:52.115 --> 00:55.048
The venom has to travel through
his bloodstream into his heart.

00:57.382 --> 00:59.282
(muffled entreating)

01:00.615 --> 01:02.282
Gaja ert.

01:03.115 --> 01:05.348
Ég migfa ro pín

01:05.382 --> 01:08.582
koma fram

01:08.615 --> 01:11.215
kona gleun gadi.

01:12.782 --> 01:14.782
It was a lot easier
when the Mandragora

01:14.815 --> 01:16.648
was doing the dirty work,
wasn't it?

01:20.882 --> 01:22.248
It's working.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.282
Let's just hope we have a match.

01:28.115 --> 01:29.382
Wait‐‐ what's happening?

01:32.115 --> 01:33.215
It didn't work.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.682
We have to find
another way.

01:42.715 --> 01:44.748
We can't keep
killing random people.

01:44.782 --> 01:46.782
Might be the problem‐‐

01:46.815 --> 01:48.248
they're random.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.282
They don't know us,
and they're scared.

01:50.315 --> 01:51.648
Of course they are.

01:51.682 --> 01:53.448
Their souls are hanging on
for dear life.

01:53.482 --> 01:54.815
Maybe we need someone

01:54.848 --> 01:57.115
who feels safe and secure enough
to let go.

01:57.148 --> 01:58.482
How do we do that?

01:58.515 --> 02:01.015
We have to find someone...

02:01.048 --> 02:02.382
who trusts you.

02:15.215 --> 02:19.182
There's my
birthday girl.

02:19.215 --> 02:21.115
I made you pancakes.

02:21.148 --> 02:23.415
Chocolate chip.

02:23.448 --> 02:24.582
Your favorite.

02:24.615 --> 02:25.848
Thanks, Mom.

02:25.882 --> 02:27.582
Actually, don't eat
too much, because

02:27.615 --> 02:30.415
there's gonna be a massive
spread at the party later.

02:30.448 --> 02:33.615
Oh, Mom. I already told you‐‐
I don't want a birthday party.

02:33.648 --> 02:37.082
This is your first‐ever
30th birthday.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.648
That is a cause
for celebration.

02:39.682 --> 02:42.415
Do you remember Freya's
birthday in 1875?

02:42.448 --> 02:43.648
Wendy!
Don't be morbid.

02:43.682 --> 02:45.015
What happened in 1875?

02:45.048 --> 02:46.082
You were impaled.

02:46.115 --> 02:47.682
What did I just say?

02:47.715 --> 02:49.648
I'm not saying it's
gonna happen again.

02:49.682 --> 02:52.415
But you are saying
this day could be worse.

02:52.448 --> 02:53.815
Freya, what's wrong?

02:53.848 --> 02:56.848
I know this is a big deal
for you and Wendy,

02:56.882 --> 03:00.748
but all I can see is that I'm
30, still living with my mother

03:00.782 --> 03:02.315
and working at a bar.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.848
And I just ran away
from my wedding

03:03.882 --> 03:05.948
to be with a man who's
married to someone else.

03:05.982 --> 03:08.482
Sweetie, you're just
going through a rough patch.

03:08.515 --> 03:10.448
This is more than a rough patch.

03:10.482 --> 03:12.015
I've lost my soul mate.

03:12.048 --> 03:15.082
That's all the love
I'm going to get in this life.

03:15.115 --> 03:17.315
Aw, honey, I have known
you a very long time,

03:17.348 --> 03:20.782
and the one thing that
you never lack for is love.

03:20.815 --> 03:23.115
Oh, it's hot. I'm gonna
go lay in the garden.

03:24.215 --> 03:26.815
Oh! You

03:26.848 --> 03:28.982
can't end
every discussion by

03:29.015 --> 03:30.482
turning into a cat!

03:30.515 --> 03:31.982
Morning, Frederick.
Hey, Mom.

03:32.015 --> 03:34.315
Freya, I'm so sorry‐‐

03:34.348 --> 03:35.648
I don't think I can make
your birthday party.

03:35.682 --> 03:36.748
Oh, it's okay.
What?

03:36.782 --> 03:38.415
Yeah, I'm just exhausted.

03:38.448 --> 03:40.148
This is important.

03:40.182 --> 03:42.015
It's your party, too.

03:42.048 --> 03:44.082
You and Freya are twins.

03:44.115 --> 03:45.115
(sighs)
It's not my birthday.

03:45.148 --> 03:46.848
We were born as twins,

03:46.882 --> 03:48.015
but she's been reborn
a lot since then.

03:48.048 --> 03:49.248
We have different birthdays now.

03:49.282 --> 03:51.248
That's a technicality.

03:51.282 --> 03:55.515
I haven't gotten to celebrate
your birthday in four centuries.

03:56.715 --> 03:58.115
JOANNA:
Well?

03:58.882 --> 04:00.348
I'll be there.

04:00.382 --> 04:02.182
(tapping on window,
door opens)

04:02.215 --> 04:03.582
Hi.
Hey.

04:03.615 --> 04:05.415
Ingrid, what are you doing here?

04:05.448 --> 04:07.182
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

04:07.215 --> 04:08.748
I got your text
asking me to brunch.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.415
But after the
gala, I started

04:10.448 --> 04:12.148
feeling weird about
the whole Freya thing,

04:12.182 --> 04:13.682
so I put off responding. And
then I felt like it was too

04:13.715 --> 04:15.848
late to respond. So
I figured I'd stop by

04:15.882 --> 04:17.515
and say I did
get your text,

04:17.548 --> 04:21.115
and I would actually love
to do brunch sometime.

04:21.148 --> 04:22.848
Oh.

04:22.882 --> 04:24.615
That‐that's so thoughtful.

04:24.648 --> 04:27.182
Dash, your toast
is burning.

04:28.182 --> 04:30.115
Hey.

04:33.515 --> 04:34.848
Ingrid, I...

04:34.882 --> 04:36.648
No explanation necessary.

04:37.648 --> 04:39.448
Sorry about your toast.

04:44.115 --> 04:46.515
Mmm.

04:46.548 --> 04:48.082
So good!

04:48.115 --> 04:49.515
I just can't
eat any more.

04:49.548 --> 04:51.015
But you eat
almost nothing.

04:51.048 --> 04:52.582
You're big,
strong man.

04:52.615 --> 04:54.248
You must eat, or
you waste away.

04:54.282 --> 04:56.082
Eat, eat!

04:56.115 --> 04:57.915
Gracias, abuela.

04:57.948 --> 04:59.515
He's full.

05:01.482 --> 05:03.948
You're killing me, Alma.

05:13.215 --> 05:16.148
You're so good
with my grandmother.

05:16.182 --> 05:17.582
She adores you.

05:17.615 --> 05:19.015
Got to go to work.

05:19.048 --> 05:20.682
Roger called.

05:20.715 --> 05:21.915
Bartending a private party.

05:21.948 --> 05:22.948
Whose party?

05:22.982 --> 05:24.182
Freya's.

05:24.215 --> 05:25.515
See you later.

05:25.548 --> 05:26.782
Adios, Alma!

05:26.815 --> 05:28.282
Adios.

05:32.448 --> 05:34.015
He loves her.

05:37.982 --> 05:40.182
He's built up a tolerance.

05:40.215 --> 05:43.315
Every day I have to make
the potion stronger,

05:43.348 --> 05:45.748
but his feelings for her...

05:45.782 --> 05:47.282
are starting to break through.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.215
And I'm still not pregnant.

06:00.148 --> 06:02.482
(meows)

06:06.715 --> 06:08.848
(sighs)

06:10.682 --> 06:11.882
Oh, my God.

06:13.382 --> 06:14.482
(gasps)
Tommy?

06:14.515 --> 06:15.682
What are you doing here?

06:15.715 --> 06:17.715
Your niece let me in.

06:21.015 --> 06:22.782
I came to surprise you.

06:23.782 --> 06:25.048
Surprise!

06:33.315 --> 06:35.248
This isn't happening.

06:35.282 --> 06:37.948
This can't be happen...
Okay, let's j...

06:37.982 --> 06:39.948
let's just stay calm.
No, I don't want to stay calm,

06:39.982 --> 06:42.315
I‐I want to know what
the hell just happened.

06:42.348 --> 06:45.748
Okay, that... is not
what it seemed like.

06:45.782 --> 06:47.082
Oh. Good...

06:47.115 --> 06:48.982
because it seemed
like you were a cat.

06:49.015 --> 06:50.248
And now you're a human.

06:50.282 --> 06:52.148
Okay, it, this may sound crazy,
just...

06:52.182 --> 06:55.015
just roll with me
for a second, okay?

06:57.782 --> 06:58.915
I'm a witch.

06:58.948 --> 07:01.915
Oh.

07:01.948 --> 07:03.182
You're a witch.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.448
Yes.

07:04.482 --> 07:06.682
Are you gonna drop
a house on me?

07:06.715 --> 07:08.315
No!
I'm a good witch.

07:08.348 --> 07:10.115
You know, one of the...

07:10.148 --> 07:11.482
one of the pretty ones!
(laughs)

07:11.515 --> 07:13.382
(tries to laugh)

07:14.482 --> 07:16.082
I'm sorry, Tommy.

07:16.115 --> 07:17.915
I didn't want you
to find out this way.

07:17.948 --> 07:19.415
I would have told you,
but we have this code...

07:19.448 --> 07:20.482
"We"?!

07:20.515 --> 07:21.782
There's more of you?

07:21.815 --> 07:24.015
Well, yeah. I mean,
there's a few.

07:24.048 --> 07:25.582
W‐We're out there.

07:25.615 --> 07:27.882
We're hiding in plain sight.
But...

07:29.948 --> 07:32.215
I won't hurt you.

07:33.348 --> 07:35.015
I don't know
what you're gonna do.

07:35.048 --> 07:36.882
Tommy.

07:38.015 --> 07:40.248
I... I...

07:40.282 --> 07:41.882
I should go.

07:44.048 --> 07:46.448
Shit!

07:46.482 --> 07:48.415
Hi, this is Ingrid.

07:48.448 --> 07:49.815
Sorry I missed your call,

07:49.848 --> 07:51.415
but leave a message
and I'll call you back.

07:51.448 --> 07:52.348
Ingrid.

07:52.382 --> 07:53.615
Hey, it's me.

07:53.648 --> 07:57.182
Look, what you saw to...

07:57.215 --> 07:58.515
That girl meant nothing to me.

07:58.548 --> 08:01.982
Okay? And, Ingrid,
when you left, I...

08:02.015 --> 08:04.015
I started thinking about
what it would be like

08:04.048 --> 08:06.982
if you never came back.

08:07.015 --> 08:08.648
Look, I know I made a lot
of mistakes recently,

08:08.682 --> 08:10.415
but I‐I don't want
to ruin this, too.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.015
So, please just give me
a call back.

08:17.348 --> 08:18.982
Is that what you're wearing?

08:19.015 --> 08:20.748
We've got to head over there.

08:20.782 --> 08:23.148
I'm not going‐‐
I'm freaking out.

08:23.182 --> 08:25.615
What's going on?
Tommy saw me shift.

08:25.648 --> 08:27.648
He what? How?!
Yes.

08:27.682 --> 08:28.948
I didn't see him.

08:28.982 --> 08:30.282
He was waiting for me
in the kitchen.

08:30.315 --> 08:32.115
Wendy, this is bad.

08:32.148 --> 08:34.015
Very bad.
Gee, ya think?

08:34.048 --> 08:35.515
JOANNA:
So, what did you tell him?

08:35.548 --> 08:37.415
The truth‐‐
what choice did I have?

08:37.448 --> 08:38.515
Oh, shit. I'm
sorry, Wendy.

08:38.548 --> 08:39.748
I know you
liked him.

08:39.782 --> 08:40.848
But maybe
there's a way...

08:40.882 --> 08:42.115
No, there's no way.

08:42.148 --> 08:43.648
You didn't know
what I was gonna say.

08:43.682 --> 08:44.948
That you just
wanted to pretend

08:44.982 --> 08:46.282
that this
didn't happen,

08:46.315 --> 08:48.115
and keep seeing him.

08:48.148 --> 08:49.615
Why can't I?

08:49.648 --> 08:51.082
Because you can't.

08:51.115 --> 08:52.448
You know what
you have to do.

08:52.482 --> 08:54.615
No, I am not doing
a memory spell on him.

08:54.648 --> 08:56.682
You don't have
a choice.

08:56.715 --> 08:59.082
He can't know what
you really are.

08:59.115 --> 09:00.015
Why not?

09:00.048 --> 09:01.415
Ugh. You know why not.

09:01.448 --> 09:02.515
(sighing):
Oh...

09:02.548 --> 09:04.815
Who cares
about the code?

09:04.848 --> 09:06.148
What's the big
deal anyway?

09:06.182 --> 09:07.848
So, a mortal knows
that we exist.

09:07.882 --> 09:10.515
The "big deal" is the
persecution we face

09:10.548 --> 09:13.482
every time they
discover what we are.

09:13.515 --> 09:15.015
We get burned at the stake,

09:15.048 --> 09:17.582
we get drowned, we get
hunted down like animals.

09:17.615 --> 09:19.448
They will always
try to destroy us.

09:19.482 --> 09:20.682
Tommy would never do that.

09:20.715 --> 09:22.815
Then he's in danger, too.

09:22.848 --> 09:25.815
Any witch who discovers he
knows the truth will kill him.

09:25.848 --> 09:30.082
You... you've got
to spell him to forget.

09:30.115 --> 09:31.782
You are such a hypocrite.

09:31.815 --> 09:33.315
You were totally against it

09:33.348 --> 09:34.948
when I erased
Maura Thatcher's memory.

09:34.982 --> 09:38.515
Tommy will be safer
if you spell him,

09:38.548 --> 09:41.048
rather than let him know
our secret.

09:42.682 --> 09:46.015
But it'll never be
safe enough, Joanna.

09:46.048 --> 09:47.282
He has a daughter.

09:47.315 --> 09:48.615
Ugh.

09:48.648 --> 09:51.148
What if he loses his mind
like Maura did?

09:51.182 --> 09:53.315
Oh, I know‐‐ it's awful.

09:53.348 --> 09:56.015
And we can do everything we can
to prevent that from happening,

09:56.048 --> 09:58.448
but you can't
see him after.

09:58.482 --> 10:02.482
We can't risk anything
triggering his memory.

10:02.515 --> 10:04.815
Your relationship
with him has to be over.

10:07.948 --> 10:09.282
I know.

10:09.315 --> 10:11.315
I'm so sorry, Wendy.

10:11.348 --> 10:14.615
I just... I‐I can't see
any other choice.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.648
It's just‐‐ he was one of the...

10:16.682 --> 10:18.215
good ones.

10:19.848 --> 10:22.148
I know.

10:22.182 --> 10:24.115
That's why
we're gonna protect him.

10:26.682 --> 10:29.315
You know, if we
leave right now,

10:29.348 --> 10:31.415
it still counts that I
came to my own party.

10:31.448 --> 10:32.948
It hasn't even started yet.

10:32.982 --> 10:34.948
This is gonna be fun, I promise.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.248
Oh, kill me now.

10:36.282 --> 10:37.648
(cell phone dings)

10:37.682 --> 10:39.382
(sighs)

10:42.215 --> 10:43.982
What are you doing here?

10:44.015 --> 10:45.015
Working.

10:45.048 --> 10:48.082
Guy's got to make a living.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.848
Fine. Then earn your keep.

10:50.882 --> 10:52.248
Make me a drink.

10:52.282 --> 10:53.515
Something strong.

10:53.548 --> 10:56.182
What can you make
that lights on fire?

10:56.215 --> 10:58.248
I know just the thing.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.315
So...

11:00.348 --> 11:02.148
happy birthday.

11:02.182 --> 11:04.315
Thanks.

11:06.048 --> 11:08.248
You look really beautiful.

11:08.282 --> 11:10.115
I mean, you...

11:10.148 --> 11:11.282
always do, it's just...

11:11.315 --> 11:13.282
you look especially beautiful...

11:13.315 --> 11:14.582
tonight.

11:14.615 --> 11:16.682
Thanks.

11:23.448 --> 11:25.015
What are you doing?

11:25.048 --> 11:26.782
Ah, trying to read your mind.

11:26.815 --> 11:28.515
It's one of my gifts.

11:28.548 --> 11:29.782
Really?

11:31.048 --> 11:32.682
And...?

11:32.715 --> 11:35.315
I'm not so good with witches.

11:35.348 --> 11:37.582
Just bits and pieces.
(quiet laugh)

11:37.615 --> 11:40.082
You don't look happy though.
You okay?

11:40.115 --> 11:41.848
Yeah. I'm great.

11:41.882 --> 11:43.782
It's my birthday.
(whoops)

11:43.815 --> 11:45.648
I'm aging.
(laughs)

11:45.682 --> 11:48.282
So, what are you making me?

11:48.315 --> 11:50.282
You'll see.

11:50.315 --> 11:53.448
Allow the artist
his time, will you?

11:56.115 --> 11:57.782
(laughs)

12:04.148 --> 12:05.515
Accende.

12:05.548 --> 12:08.682
Looks like the artist
is getting better.

12:08.715 --> 12:09.848
A few tricks.

12:09.882 --> 12:11.648
Hard to bust out at parties.

12:11.682 --> 12:13.182
I know. I hate that.

12:13.215 --> 12:15.748
Not being able to show
the world what you can do.

12:15.782 --> 12:18.148
At least I can show you.

12:20.982 --> 12:22.615
Careful, it's hot.

12:22.648 --> 12:25.048
I think I can handle it.

12:26.348 --> 12:28.682
Can I have my drink, please?

12:35.315 --> 12:37.015
You look terrible.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.348
You get enough sleep?

12:38.382 --> 12:39.682
We need to talk.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.882
Wow. That sounds serious.

12:43.048 --> 12:44.615
I can't do it tonight.

12:44.648 --> 12:45.648
In fact...

12:45.682 --> 12:46.648
Afferrentur dolor.

12:46.682 --> 12:49.515
Oh, God!

12:49.548 --> 12:51.348
I'm sorry.

12:51.382 --> 12:53.348
I can't hear you.
What was that?

12:53.382 --> 12:56.648
If we keep
killing people like this,

12:56.682 --> 12:58.982
eventually
we're gonna get caught.

13:00.615 --> 13:02.982
Remora.

13:03.015 --> 13:05.182
So...
(coughing)

13:05.215 --> 13:07.215
what do you suggest?

13:11.882 --> 13:14.682
(gasping)

13:17.048 --> 13:18.615
I suggest you rot in hell.

13:18.648 --> 13:20.615
Oh!

13:29.115 --> 13:31.582
Oh, let me guess.

13:31.615 --> 13:33.382
(indistinct chatter)
♪ ♪

13:36.268 --> 13:37.468
Happy birthday.

13:37.501 --> 13:39.368
Thanks, guys.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.934
Thank you.

13:47.001 --> 13:48.101
What are you doing?

13:48.134 --> 13:49.201
Nothing.
What did you do?

13:49.234 --> 13:51.268
Nothing.

13:51.301 --> 13:53.934
Okay, fine. I think
Killian is flirting

13:53.968 --> 13:57.401
with me a little. A lot.

13:57.434 --> 13:59.634
Definitely. He's definitely
flirting with me.

13:59.668 --> 14:01.201
He's married.
I know.

14:01.234 --> 14:03.234
And you're over him.
I know. Okay.

14:03.268 --> 14:04.901
He's probably just
being nice to me

14:04.934 --> 14:06.301
because it's my birthday.
(cell phone dings)

14:10.468 --> 14:11.901
Who's that?

14:11.934 --> 14:14.068
Barb. She's really sorry

14:14.101 --> 14:15.534
she can't make it tonight.

14:15.568 --> 14:17.568
But she's still on bed rest.

14:17.601 --> 14:19.901
Hmm. Tell Barb I said hi.

14:21.001 --> 14:22.201
Cheers.

14:22.234 --> 14:24.468
Happy birthday.

14:24.501 --> 14:26.234
Can I get a shot of something?

14:26.268 --> 14:27.634
Sure. Yeah. What do you want?

14:27.668 --> 14:29.134
Doesn't matter.
Tequila, whatever.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.434
You got it.

14:32.634 --> 14:34.134
Happy birthday.

14:35.601 --> 14:37.101
You're Freya's twin, right?

14:37.134 --> 14:39.234
Can I just get the drink?

14:46.601 --> 14:48.801
Do you have a problem with me?

14:48.834 --> 14:50.634
You really don't
remember, do you?

14:50.668 --> 14:52.868
Remember what?

14:52.901 --> 14:54.568
I remember.

14:54.601 --> 14:57.068
I know exactly what you
did back in Asgard.

14:57.101 --> 14:58.134
All right.
What are you talking about?

14:58.168 --> 14:59.268
I don't know you, man.

14:59.301 --> 15:00.534
You knew me

15:00.568 --> 15:02.068
a very long time ago.

15:02.101 --> 15:05.534
You may not
remember, but I do.

15:05.568 --> 15:07.868
Look, I don't know
what this is about.

15:07.901 --> 15:09.701
But you got the wrong guy.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.634
Just stay away from my sister

15:12.668 --> 15:15.001
if you know what's good for you.

15:24.601 --> 15:27.134
Whoa!

15:29.668 --> 15:32.168
Tommy?

15:33.668 --> 15:35.568
Can I talk to you?

15:35.601 --> 15:39.234
Yeah.

15:39.268 --> 15:41.868
You're here.

15:41.901 --> 15:43.401
I'm sorry I ran out on you

15:43.434 --> 15:44.634
this morning.
I'm sorry that I...

15:44.668 --> 15:45.934
I really am.

15:45.968 --> 15:47.068
You're freaked.

15:47.101 --> 15:48.101
It's standard.

15:48.134 --> 15:49.201
(laughs)
I'm...

15:49.234 --> 15:52.301
a little... overwhelmed.

15:52.334 --> 15:54.901
God, you must hate me.
No. No, no. I don't.

15:54.934 --> 15:56.801
I think you're actually
a great person.

15:56.834 --> 16:00.068
If‐if you're, in
fact, a person.

16:00.101 --> 16:02.901
Oh, I'm a person.
I'm just other things, too.

16:04.101 --> 16:06.401
You're a witch.

16:11.568 --> 16:13.801
FREYA:
30! Oh, my God!

16:13.834 --> 16:15.901
(all laughing)
It only happens twice.

16:18.101 --> 16:20.701
(indistinct chatter)
Hey.

16:20.734 --> 16:22.268
Can I talk to you
in the storeroom?

16:22.301 --> 16:25.068
I can't, um, find the olives.

16:25.101 --> 16:27.301
They're on the shelf right
where they always are.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.401
Yeah. I really need
your help, please?

16:29.434 --> 16:31.301
Okay.

16:31.334 --> 16:32.634
I'll see you guys.

16:32.668 --> 16:34.734
(laughs)

16:38.601 --> 16:40.101
What's going on?

16:40.134 --> 16:41.468
Can we talk?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.101
You brought me in here to talk.

16:43.134 --> 16:44.568
Looks like we're talking.

16:44.601 --> 16:46.568
Okay, uh, this is gonna seem

16:46.601 --> 16:48.701
a little out of the blue,
but seeing you tonight,

16:48.734 --> 16:50.868
I suddenly feel

16:50.901 --> 16:53.068
like everything
is so clear.

16:53.101 --> 16:54.801
Okay.
(short laugh)

16:54.834 --> 16:57.568
Uh, I woke up today...

16:57.601 --> 16:59.268
married.

16:59.301 --> 17:01.768
And I don't know
how it happened.

17:01.801 --> 17:03.234
I assume there were vows.

17:03.268 --> 17:04.268
And probably some cake.

17:04.301 --> 17:05.868
Okay, this is serious.

17:05.901 --> 17:08.601
Look, I'm still
in love with you.

17:08.634 --> 17:11.201
Why are you doing this?

17:11.234 --> 17:14.368
I wish I could forget about
you and move on, but I can't.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.768
You did move on.
You got married.

17:16.801 --> 17:18.134
I'm telling you I'm
not in love with her.

17:18.168 --> 17:20.068
Yes, you are.
I have read your aura.

17:20.101 --> 17:21.901
I thought I was.

17:21.934 --> 17:23.401
But I'm not.

17:24.968 --> 17:27.368
Every morning, the first thing
I think about when I wake up

17:27.401 --> 17:29.368
is you.

17:29.401 --> 17:31.301
I dream about you
every night.

17:31.334 --> 17:33.468
I've been trying to ignore
it because of Eva,

17:33.501 --> 17:35.434
but it's just
getting stronger.

17:35.468 --> 17:37.268
And I can't live
a lie anymore.

17:37.301 --> 17:39.868
I have no idea why
I married her.

17:39.901 --> 17:42.734
Maybe it's because I just

17:42.768 --> 17:44.268
found out what I really was.

17:44.301 --> 17:45.601
She helped guide me through it.

17:45.634 --> 17:47.568
I don't know.
Wait, what do you mean?

17:47.601 --> 17:49.068
She's a witch, too.

17:49.934 --> 17:51.268
She's a witch?

17:51.301 --> 17:53.468
She helped me so much.
She saved my life.

17:53.501 --> 17:55.234
And she's a good person,
but that is not enough.

17:55.268 --> 17:56.368
I don't...

17:56.401 --> 17:58.968
love her. I don't.

17:59.001 --> 18:01.868
I think maybe
I went temporarily
insane or something.

18:01.901 --> 18:03.301
I think you're still insane.

18:03.334 --> 18:05.101
How are you saying
this to me right now?!

18:05.134 --> 18:07.201
On my birthday,
by the way.

18:07.234 --> 18:08.234
I know it sounds nuts.

18:08.268 --> 18:10.034
Okay? I do.
Yeah.

18:10.068 --> 18:11.701
But this is the most sane

18:11.734 --> 18:14.901
I have felt in months.

18:14.934 --> 18:17.801
It is so clear to me
we belong together.

18:19.168 --> 18:21.934
It doesn't matter
if we belong together.

18:21.968 --> 18:24.801
We've tried to be together
in other lives.

18:24.834 --> 18:26.801
And every time
we get involved,

18:26.834 --> 18:29.734
you die or I die
or we both die.

18:29.768 --> 18:33.234
We are literally star‐crossed.
It doesn't matter what we want.

18:33.268 --> 18:35.201
Wait, what are
you talking about?

18:35.234 --> 18:37.534
Even if you weren't married,

18:37.568 --> 18:39.934
we could never ever be together.

18:42.468 --> 18:44.901
Freya?
Don't follow me!

18:54.734 --> 18:57.068
Happy birthday.

18:57.101 --> 18:59.134
Hey.

18:59.168 --> 19:01.401
Thanks.

19:01.434 --> 19:03.068
Hope you like it.
I had to go to, like,

19:03.101 --> 19:04.968
five stores to find it
and then finally

19:05.001 --> 19:06.768
they just ordered it special.

19:06.801 --> 19:09.101
Thank you.
What, uh, what is it?

19:09.134 --> 19:12.301
It's aquavit.
Since your mom said you

19:12.334 --> 19:13.968
spent so much time in Denmark
and my friends told me...

19:14.001 --> 19:15.234
Right, right, right. Yeah.

19:15.268 --> 19:16.968
Yeah, I‐I drank a ton of this.

19:17.001 --> 19:17.968
Thank you.

19:18.001 --> 19:20.568
You don't like it.

19:20.601 --> 19:22.801
I do. I love it.

19:30.068 --> 19:31.368
Hello, Frederick.

19:31.401 --> 19:33.234
I didn't expect
to see you here.

19:33.268 --> 19:35.268
And I suspect
the feeling is mutual.

19:35.301 --> 19:37.101
Caroline, um,

19:37.134 --> 19:38.268
could you, could you give me

19:38.301 --> 19:39.968
a minute, please?
I‐I‐I just...

19:40.001 --> 19:42.568
He needs to talk to me, darling.

19:47.001 --> 19:49.068
So, let's review.

19:49.101 --> 19:51.934
I can't cut the king spirit
out of your chest.

19:51.968 --> 19:53.401
And you can't kill me.

19:53.434 --> 19:55.268
Does that about cover it?

19:55.301 --> 19:57.734
But I did kill you.

19:57.768 --> 19:59.634
I told you, I'm a telepath.

19:59.668 --> 20:01.234
I can read your thoughts.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.868
I think I can defend against
a little knife to the heart.

20:03.901 --> 20:05.734
But how? How‐how...?

20:05.768 --> 20:06.901
I...

20:06.934 --> 20:09.434
am far more powerful

20:09.468 --> 20:11.068
than you think.

20:11.101 --> 20:13.568
And that is something
you should never

20:13.601 --> 20:16.268
ever forget.

20:17.501 --> 20:18.868
Now, if you're
through playing games,

20:18.901 --> 20:20.934
it's time to get back to work.

20:22.001 --> 20:24.968
I think we were
looking for someone

20:25.001 --> 20:26.901
who trusted you.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.068
I have an idea.

20:32.068 --> 20:34.668
Wait! Wait!

20:36.101 --> 20:37.634
(quiet laugh)
We're done.

20:37.668 --> 20:39.634
Yeah, you can go back
and talk to him

20:39.668 --> 20:41.501
if you like.

20:42.768 --> 20:44.268
Can I get you a drink?

20:44.301 --> 20:46.534
We haven't really had
much time to catch up.

20:46.568 --> 20:48.468
Is that your game?

20:48.501 --> 20:51.901
Swooping in
on helpless widows?

20:51.934 --> 20:53.468
You are many things, Joanna.

20:53.501 --> 20:56.534
But, uh, helpless has
never been one of them.

20:56.568 --> 20:59.268
(laughs)
Drink sounds lovely.

21:00.768 --> 21:02.734
Are you okay?

21:02.768 --> 21:04.201
Yeah.

21:04.234 --> 21:05.701
Yeah, I'm...
I'm fine. Uh...

21:05.734 --> 21:07.468
Do you want to
get out of here?

21:07.501 --> 21:08.934
I think this party's
winding down. We can...

21:08.968 --> 21:11.201
open this at home
and share a glass.

21:11.234 --> 21:14.801
Then I can give you
your other birthday gift.

21:15.968 --> 21:17.401
Okay.

21:19.668 --> 21:21.634
(phone dings)

21:27.134 --> 21:28.468
Dash.

21:28.501 --> 21:29.701
What are you doing here?

21:29.734 --> 21:31.201
Well, you're...

21:31.234 --> 21:33.301
you're not returning
my calls or my texts.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.634
I've... been going
a little crazy.

21:34.668 --> 21:36.868
This is Freya's
birthday party.

21:36.901 --> 21:38.801
Yeah. I know.

21:38.834 --> 21:41.468
But I had to
apologize in person.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.768
Ingrid, I am

21:44.801 --> 21:46.401
so sorry.

21:46.434 --> 21:48.368
I didn't think
I had a chance with you.

21:48.401 --> 21:50.068
What, you wanted
a chance?

21:50.101 --> 21:51.968
Why do you think I'm here?

21:52.001 --> 21:53.801
Look, Ingrid,

21:53.834 --> 21:57.868
I am in awe of you.

21:57.901 --> 21:59.568
I mean, you're powerful

21:59.601 --> 22:01.068
and every bit
of that power

22:01.101 --> 22:03.201
goes towards
helping people.

22:03.234 --> 22:06.268
Why wouldn't I want to be
around someone like that?

22:06.301 --> 22:08.401
Listen...
(sighs)

22:08.434 --> 22:12.134
Ingrid, what you
saw this morning...

22:13.468 --> 22:14.868
I don't know
why I did that.

22:14.901 --> 22:17.301
I've been a little
messed up lately,

22:17.334 --> 22:19.401
and the only thing

22:19.434 --> 22:21.701
that's been holding
me together is you.

22:21.734 --> 22:24.734
When I'm with you,
I‐I feel...

22:26.468 --> 22:27.634
I feel good.

22:27.668 --> 22:29.734
I want to give
this a try.

22:31.234 --> 22:33.068
So...

22:35.334 --> 22:37.068
Will you give me a chance?

22:38.168 --> 22:39.568
Please?

22:47.734 --> 22:50.201
Freya?

22:50.234 --> 22:52.701
What are you
doing here?

22:52.734 --> 22:53.901
I was worried
about you.

22:53.934 --> 22:55.201
(sighs)
Could you please go worry

22:55.234 --> 22:56.401
about someone else?

22:56.434 --> 22:57.601
You're the one
I worry about.

22:57.634 --> 22:58.768
I can't help it.

22:59.801 --> 23:01.068
You can't tell me

23:01.101 --> 23:02.568
we've been together
in other lives,

23:02.601 --> 23:05.001
that we keep dying,
and then just walk away.

23:06.901 --> 23:09.934
I am cursed, Killian.

23:09.968 --> 23:12.934
And my curse is
I die young.

23:14.468 --> 23:17.768
And then I'm reborn,
over and over again.

23:18.901 --> 23:21.434
But I always
die young.

23:21.468 --> 23:23.634
My mom gets pregnant
right away, and...

23:23.668 --> 23:26.301
it just starts
right over.

23:26.334 --> 23:27.868
Whoa.

23:27.901 --> 23:30.901
And in almost
every life I've had,

23:30.934 --> 23:32.201
I've met you.

23:32.234 --> 23:34.534
You always have
different names,

23:34.568 --> 23:36.301
different
identities,

23:36.334 --> 23:39.068
but it always ends in tragedy.

23:40.268 --> 23:42.268
So I was right.
We are connected.

23:42.301 --> 23:44.234
You're my soul mate.

23:44.268 --> 23:46.101
And I love you.

23:47.101 --> 23:48.601
But it doesn't
matter,

23:48.634 --> 23:51.434
because we can
never be together.

23:51.468 --> 23:53.401
(sighs)

23:53.434 --> 23:55.134
You've never
said that before.

23:55.168 --> 23:57.001
What?

23:58.834 --> 24:00.034
That you love me.

24:00.068 --> 24:02.301
It's true.

24:09.734 --> 24:11.234
Screw fate.

24:16.601 --> 24:18.068
I'm sorry.

24:26.968 --> 24:29.301
Killian.

24:46.901 --> 24:48.101
All right.

24:48.134 --> 24:50.468
Show me what
you got, Glinda.

24:50.501 --> 24:52.334
Ostium clausum.

24:53.634 --> 24:55.868
Wow.
That was amazing.

24:55.901 --> 24:58.201
Oh, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

24:58.234 --> 24:59.901
Creare litus.

25:04.101 --> 25:06.534
(waves crashing)
Huh.

25:06.568 --> 25:08.601
Wow... where are we?

25:10.734 --> 25:12.134
Bali.

25:12.168 --> 25:13.601
I always wanted to go there.

25:13.634 --> 25:15.068
We're in Bali?

25:15.101 --> 25:17.201
As Bali as you can get

25:17.234 --> 25:19.401
in the Bent Elbow storeroom.

25:20.301 --> 25:21.468
It's beautiful.

25:21.501 --> 25:22.801
It's an illusion.

25:22.834 --> 25:24.034
It's temporary.

25:24.068 --> 25:26.701
But it ain't
half bad.

25:26.734 --> 25:29.101
Well, maybe we can go there
for real someday.

25:36.601 --> 25:38.068
(panting)

25:38.101 --> 25:41.268
♪ ♪

26:10.501 --> 26:13.601
♪ ♪

26:22.334 --> 26:24.768
(panting)

26:33.768 --> 26:35.801
(moaning)

26:35.834 --> 26:37.734
Happy birthday.

26:37.768 --> 26:40.568
(laughs)

26:40.601 --> 26:43.301
Oh, that was...

26:48.068 --> 26:50.301
What's wrong?

26:50.334 --> 26:53.734
I just don't want
to lose you again.

26:53.768 --> 26:56.068
(sighs)

26:56.101 --> 26:58.434
This whole
star‐crossed thing‐‐

26:58.468 --> 27:00.034
I don't...
I don't buy it.

27:00.068 --> 27:01.934
You're a witch,
I'm a warlock.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.468
Maybe we're both magic
in this lifetime for a reason.

27:04.501 --> 27:07.068
Whatever fate throws at us‐‐
we can take it.

27:07.101 --> 27:08.634
No, we can't.

27:08.668 --> 27:10.201
That's the whole
point of fate.

27:10.234 --> 27:11.568
We're at its mercy.

27:11.601 --> 27:13.868
Bullshit. If the stars
are crossed, we'll...

27:13.901 --> 27:15.534
we'll change 'em.

27:15.568 --> 27:17.201
We'll find a way.

27:17.234 --> 27:20.001
We belong together.
You said it yourself.

27:21.634 --> 27:25.568
So, let's make
our own destiny

27:25.601 --> 27:29.101
together.

27:31.668 --> 27:33.568
What about Eva?

27:37.568 --> 27:39.934
I should talk to her.

27:39.968 --> 27:42.068
I want to start this off
on the right foot.

27:44.634 --> 27:46.968
And then what?

27:47.001 --> 27:49.068
Meet me at the Bent Elbow
at midnight.

27:49.101 --> 27:50.701
We'll start our life
together tonight.

27:50.734 --> 27:53.268
We'll take a trip
wherever you want.

27:53.301 --> 27:55.134
Pack a bag.

27:55.168 --> 27:58.401
Anywhere but
Santo Domingo.

27:58.434 --> 28:01.001
(both laugh)

28:21.801 --> 28:23.734
Cheers.

28:23.768 --> 28:27.068
Cheers.

28:28.434 --> 28:32.534
It was delicious.
I miss this.

28:32.568 --> 28:35.134
(coughing)

28:35.168 --> 28:37.101
It's not quite what
I was expecting.

28:37.134 --> 28:39.568
You‐you got
to finish it, though.

28:45.934 --> 28:49.334
(ice clinking)

28:51.334 --> 28:54.301
I threw this whole party, and
no one even stayed for cake.

28:54.334 --> 28:56.068
Well, your children
are grown up.

28:56.101 --> 28:58.401
They can fend for themselves,
live their own lives.

28:58.434 --> 29:00.134
Lot of people
would envy you.

29:00.168 --> 29:02.768
Yeah?
Yeah, me, for one.

29:02.801 --> 29:04.568
Children, marriage‐‐
I never did that.

29:04.601 --> 29:06.601
Well, you could have
if you wanted to.

29:06.634 --> 29:08.401
Come on, with who?
A mortal?

29:08.434 --> 29:10.201
And another
and another. (scoffs)

29:10.234 --> 29:11.768
Well, there's
plenty of us here.

29:11.801 --> 29:13.234
There must have
been some witch

29:13.268 --> 29:15.368
that you fell for
over the years.

29:15.401 --> 29:17.934
There was one.
Who?
You.

29:17.968 --> 29:20.801
Me? Oh. (laughs)

29:20.834 --> 29:22.368
Yeah, come on.
You knew.

29:22.401 --> 29:24.434
You‐you had a...

29:24.468 --> 29:26.868
You had a crush...

29:26.901 --> 29:29.101
a long time ago.

29:29.134 --> 29:31.768
(laughs)
It was more
than a crush.

29:31.801 --> 29:33.968
It was first love.

29:34.001 --> 29:37.034
And that stays with you.

29:37.068 --> 29:39.768
For centuries?

29:39.801 --> 29:43.468
Yeah. I knew the moment
that I met you.

29:45.734 --> 29:49.201
But you were the daughter
of the king.

29:49.234 --> 29:53.201
I was just
a lowly guardsman, and...

29:53.234 --> 29:56.801
I was too loyal to ever dream
about making a move on you.

29:56.834 --> 30:01.234
But the fact that you were even
willing to be my friend‐‐

30:01.268 --> 30:04.668
that felt like enough, somehow.

30:06.101 --> 30:10.001
And I was glad
that you found love with Victor.

30:12.501 --> 30:14.501
Even though
I wished it were me.

30:16.768 --> 30:18.701
I've never been easy
to live with.
(laughs)

30:18.734 --> 30:21.268
I think you dodged
a bullet there.

30:21.301 --> 30:22.901
(laughter)

30:22.934 --> 30:25.368
I doubt Victor
would have said that.

30:25.401 --> 30:27.701
You two always
seemed happy.

30:27.734 --> 30:29.934
We were.

30:29.968 --> 30:32.368
When you add it
all up, we were.
Yeah.

30:32.401 --> 30:34.701
Mm.

30:34.734 --> 30:36.868
I can't believe
I didn't get to say good‐bye.

30:36.901 --> 30:40.234
You know, I did, and...

30:40.268 --> 30:43.734
it still doesn't seem real.

30:43.768 --> 30:46.134
It still hasn't hit
me that he's gone,

30:46.168 --> 30:48.568
and that, this time,
he's not coming back.

30:48.601 --> 30:51.468
Life just keeps going on
and on and on, and...

30:51.501 --> 30:55.434
nobody talks about him, because
they don't know him like I...

30:55.468 --> 30:58.234
like I did.
I knew him.

30:58.268 --> 31:00.834
I know. I know.

31:03.468 --> 31:06.201
As long as we're still here,

31:06.234 --> 31:08.801
so is he.

31:13.234 --> 31:15.801
To Victor.

31:24.101 --> 31:26.234
(sighs)

31:26.268 --> 31:28.701
How are you feeling?
(chuckling)

31:28.734 --> 31:30.434
Great.

31:30.468 --> 31:32.034
Better than great.

31:32.068 --> 31:34.534
Yeah?
Mm‐hmm.

31:34.568 --> 31:35.934
(both chuckle)

31:35.968 --> 31:38.568
(groans)

31:39.501 --> 31:42.734
Ingrid...
(sighs)

31:42.768 --> 31:44.734
look, there's something
I need to tell you.

31:44.768 --> 31:47.368
I‐I probably should
have told you sooner, but...

31:47.401 --> 31:49.234
(gasps)
Freya.

31:49.268 --> 31:51.101
Huh?
I need to call her.

31:51.134 --> 31:53.568
I never told anyone I
was leaving her party.

31:53.601 --> 31:55.268
I feel terrible.

31:59.268 --> 32:01.734
My phone's dead.
Well, use mine.

32:01.768 --> 32:03.801
Yeah, that's what Freya wants
for her birthday,

32:03.834 --> 32:05.634
me calling from your phone
in your bed.

32:05.668 --> 32:08.234
I'll just send her
an e‐mail.

32:21.601 --> 32:23.001
What is this?

32:25.168 --> 32:27.768
Ingrid, wait, no,
don't look at that.

32:27.801 --> 32:30.001
What the hell is this, Dash?

32:31.334 --> 32:33.468
What did you do?

32:41.042 --> 32:42.642
Give me that.

32:42.676 --> 32:45.176
Kyle Hutton
was blackmailing you.

32:45.209 --> 32:48.209
The man you killed, the body
we dumped in the ocean,

32:48.242 --> 32:49.809
that wasn't an accident, was it?

32:49.842 --> 32:51.642
No, no, it was.
I swear it was an accident.

32:51.676 --> 32:54.742
You murdered him!
And I helped you cover it up.

32:54.776 --> 32:56.342
Ingrid, he was gonna shoot you.

32:56.376 --> 32:58.009
This was before I knew how
to control my powers.

32:58.042 --> 33:00.709
And William Hutton?
His father.

33:00.742 --> 33:03.209
You killed him, too,
didn't you? What happened?

33:03.242 --> 33:05.209
Did he
figure it out?

33:05.242 --> 33:07.642
So you killed him,
in front of everyone,

33:07.676 --> 33:09.809
and then pretended
to try to save him.

33:09.842 --> 33:11.509
It's not that simple.
And Killian?

33:11.542 --> 33:13.542
Does he know you left him
to die like that?

33:13.576 --> 33:15.842
Killian is alive.
I didn't leave him to anything.

33:15.876 --> 33:18.042
I trusted you. I helped you.

33:18.076 --> 33:20.376
Ingrid, do you know how many
lives I've been able to save

33:20.409 --> 33:21.909
since I learned how
to use my powers?

33:21.942 --> 33:24.176
More than over the whole rest
of my career.

33:24.209 --> 33:27.609
I mean, I can lay my hands
on a patient and heal them.

33:28.742 --> 33:29.842
It's one death

33:29.876 --> 33:31.842
or two versus
saving hundreds.

33:31.876 --> 33:33.009
Maybe thousands.

33:33.042 --> 33:34.642
You're murdering people.

33:34.676 --> 33:37.342
Not everything
is black and white

33:37.376 --> 33:38.542
or easy.

33:38.576 --> 33:41.376
I'm...

33:41.409 --> 33:43.209
Stay away from me.

33:44.076 --> 33:46.742
You mean something to me.

33:46.776 --> 33:48.176
This...

33:48.209 --> 33:49.876
means something to me.

33:49.909 --> 33:53.076
You mean nothing to me.

33:57.876 --> 34:00.842
(groans)

34:03.342 --> 34:05.242
Hey.

34:09.576 --> 34:12.409
How's your grandmother?

34:12.442 --> 34:15.176
She's fine.

34:15.209 --> 34:18.509
I gave her our bed.

34:18.542 --> 34:21.076
Is everything okay?

34:22.942 --> 34:25.442
We need to talk.

34:29.676 --> 34:32.042
(sighs)
I am worn out.

34:32.076 --> 34:34.642
(chuckles)
Turns out...

34:34.676 --> 34:36.976
you are a bad witch
after all.

34:37.009 --> 34:39.976
(chuckles)

34:40.009 --> 34:42.509
I'm glad you came back.

34:42.542 --> 34:45.576
Yeah, I'm glad I did.
I had

34:45.609 --> 34:47.476
a really good night with you.

34:47.509 --> 34:50.009
So... now you can tell me
what's going on.

34:50.042 --> 34:51.876
What?

34:51.909 --> 34:53.476
You've been looking at me
all night

34:53.509 --> 34:55.342
with those sad puppy dog eyes.

34:55.376 --> 34:57.209
Oh, please.

34:57.242 --> 34:59.476
I have cat eyes,
thank you very much.

34:59.509 --> 35:01.176
(sighs)

35:01.209 --> 35:03.842
I did not look like that.
Well...

35:04.842 --> 35:08.542
I'm just... I'm supposed to...

35:10.542 --> 35:13.009
We can't see each other

35:13.042 --> 35:14.709
anymore.

35:14.742 --> 35:16.242
What do you mean?

35:18.176 --> 35:19.976
I'm supposed to spell you,

35:20.009 --> 35:21.542
but I can't do it.

35:21.576 --> 35:24.309
I won't... do it.

35:24.342 --> 35:27.509
So please just swear on an oath
that you'll forget about me,

35:27.542 --> 35:30.076
and we'll never
speak again.

35:32.409 --> 35:34.609
That's the only way
that you'll be safe.

35:35.542 --> 35:38.509
What are you
talking about?

35:40.842 --> 35:42.909
(sniffles)

35:42.942 --> 35:44.709
Just...

35:46.276 --> 35:49.976
There's so much about my world
you don't understand.

35:50.009 --> 35:52.509
Then explain it to me.
I can't.

35:52.542 --> 35:55.309
There's a code.

35:55.342 --> 35:59.876
I don't want this thing to end
between us, but...

35:59.909 --> 36:02.176
I can't put you in danger.

36:02.209 --> 36:06.676
Look, shouldn't that be up
to me to decide?
You'd be

36:06.709 --> 36:08.409
putting your life at risk.
So what?

36:08.442 --> 36:11.076
I've done it before.

36:11.109 --> 36:13.976
(sighs)
In the Army, we
have a code, too.

36:14.009 --> 36:15.976
"I will never accept defeat,

36:16.009 --> 36:18.542
and I will never leave a comrade
behind."

36:18.576 --> 36:20.409
Look at me.

36:20.442 --> 36:22.742
I'm not gonna leave you.

36:25.009 --> 36:27.709
I like your code.

36:27.742 --> 36:29.176
(laughing)

36:52.676 --> 36:54.542
That drink was strong.

36:54.576 --> 36:58.009
I didn't think
that it would be that strong.

37:01.609 --> 37:03.242
Close your eyes.

37:03.276 --> 37:05.842
(exhales)

37:20.276 --> 37:21.509
That too tight?

37:21.542 --> 37:23.176
No.

37:26.942 --> 37:28.709
Do you trust me?

37:47.009 --> 37:49.209
(moaning)

37:49.242 --> 37:51.642
(coughs)

37:51.676 --> 37:53.342
Quitale el dolor.

37:55.409 --> 37:58.009
I should take you
to the hospital.

37:58.042 --> 37:59.709
No, no.

37:59.742 --> 38:01.976
It does not matter.

38:02.009 --> 38:05.042
I go, I don't go.

38:05.076 --> 38:07.242
I'm dying.

38:07.276 --> 38:08.742
Don't say that.

38:08.776 --> 38:11.376
But I will stay

38:11.409 --> 38:15.142
as long as I can.

38:15.176 --> 38:16.976
Until I know

38:17.009 --> 38:18.242
you have his child

38:18.276 --> 38:19.876
inside you.

38:19.909 --> 38:22.376
Shh...

38:22.409 --> 38:23.876
(sniffles)

38:23.909 --> 38:26.209
You shouldn't be worrying
about that.

38:26.242 --> 38:30.709
But I‐I don't want you
to die, too.

38:30.742 --> 38:33.476
I love you, Mama.

38:33.509 --> 38:36.876
I love you,
too, baby girl.

38:36.909 --> 38:40.076
You're gonna
be okay.

38:40.109 --> 38:42.676
Your mama's got you.

38:44.709 --> 38:47.242
Your mama's got you.

38:49.676 --> 38:52.209
(door opens)

38:53.242 --> 38:55.842
(door shuts)

38:57.242 --> 38:59.576
Hey.

38:59.609 --> 39:01.976
Finally.

39:02.009 --> 39:03.542
I was getting worried.
No, I'm sorry.

39:03.576 --> 39:04.976
I can't do this.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.809
What?

39:06.842 --> 39:08.209
I wanted to tell you in person.

39:08.242 --> 39:11.142
Tonight was
a mistake.

39:11.176 --> 39:13.676
I don't know what came over
me, but Eva's my wife.

39:13.709 --> 39:15.576
I love her. I‐I
can't leave her.

39:15.609 --> 39:17.009
I'm sorry.

39:17.042 --> 39:19.409
I don't understand.

39:19.442 --> 39:22.042
I got swept up in the moment.

39:22.076 --> 39:24.876
You were right. We
can't be together.

39:24.909 --> 39:26.809
What happened
between us,

39:26.842 --> 39:30.209
it can never happen again.

39:34.009 --> 39:36.076
I'm sorry, Freya.

39:42.842 --> 39:45.376
(door shuts)

39:58.009 --> 40:00.009
What is that?

40:00.042 --> 40:01.876
It's massage oil.

40:01.909 --> 40:04.309
It's making me feel numb.

40:04.342 --> 40:05.909
That means it's working.

40:05.942 --> 40:07.376
After you go numb,
it'll be

40:07.409 --> 40:10.409
the most wonderful thing
you've ever experienced.

40:13.042 --> 40:15.209
I love you, Freddie.

40:20.509 --> 40:22.476
I think you're a little drunk.

40:22.509 --> 40:24.676
(chuckles)

40:24.709 --> 40:26.676
No.

40:26.709 --> 40:29.109
I love you.

40:35.442 --> 40:39.376
I'm gonna try something, okay?

40:39.409 --> 40:42.376
I promise
you won't feel a thing.
