00:16.000 --> 00:17.624
My kid wants to quit soccer.

00:17.625 --> 00:19.837
- You think I should let him?
- Is he any good?

00:20.555 --> 00:22.806
Nobody quits what they're good at.

00:23.975 --> 00:25.942
So who the fuck is this asshole?

00:25.977 --> 00:29.089
Wayne Henry Gilcrest, Jr.,
also known as Holy Wayne.

00:29.090 --> 00:30.334
- Messianic?
- Maybe.

00:30.335 --> 00:34.450
He lost a kid on the 14th, worked
the colleges and malls for a while.

00:34.987 --> 00:37.154
Claims he can hug the pain out of people.

00:37.156 --> 00:38.788
Magic fucking hugs.

00:38.823 --> 00:41.241
Yeah, the only catch is he needs to, uh,

00:41.292 --> 00:44.127
charge his batteries with teenage
girls; Asian ones, apparently.

00:44.162 --> 00:45.355
- Apparently.
- We had him

00:45.356 --> 00:49.132
on 8 counts of statutory in Pennsylvania,
but he went underground in April.

00:49.167 --> 00:52.169
FBI got a tip that he set
up shop at a ranch in Nevada.

00:52.171 --> 00:54.671
- FBI?
- Guy's got a pipeline to D.C.,

00:54.722 --> 00:57.007
sells his hugs to senators, I guess.

00:57.009 --> 00:59.976
Well, that would make him a
threat to national security.

01:00.011 --> 01:02.429
If that's your assessment.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.431
- Guns?
- Got a couple dozen guys at the ranch.

01:04.482 --> 01:06.516
- Semi-pro, no explosives.
- Civilians?

01:06.518 --> 01:08.435
Followers are mostly dumb college kids,

01:08.486 --> 01:10.770
usually a couple on the
ranch running errands.

01:10.821 --> 01:13.106
- He looking to get martyred?
- Looking to get laid.

01:13.157 --> 01:14.758
Heh!

01:25.169 --> 01:26.703
Ok.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.705
Let's get him.

01:28.707 --> 01:30.457
Here we go! Go, go, go!

01:37.798 --> 01:39.883
We got clear.

01:40.885 --> 01:43.386
Cease fire!

01:43.437 --> 01:44.938
Don't do it! Come out!

01:44.972 --> 01:47.023
Hands!

01:48.776 --> 01:51.144
Hands up!

01:59.480 --> 02:01.531
Bedroom is clear!

02:09.824 --> 02:11.825
- No!
- Where is he?

02:11.876 --> 02:14.244
Where's Wayne? Look here.

02:14.246 --> 02:15.746
Where is he?

02:15.748 --> 02:17.047
I don't know!

02:17.081 --> 02:19.583
Where's Wayne?

02:19.585 --> 02:21.084
I got one!

02:21.086 --> 02:22.552
Do not move!

02:22.587 --> 02:25.722
Do not run, you fucking cunt!

02:25.757 --> 02:27.557
Stop!

02:27.592 --> 02:29.760
Do not fucking move!

02:29.811 --> 02:31.428
Hands.

02:32.981 --> 02:35.599
Turn around.

02:38.152 --> 02:40.687
Get on your fucking knees.

02:42.607 --> 02:43.774
Where's Wayne?

02:43.776 --> 02:45.642
- I don't know.
- Where the fuck is he?!

02:45.677 --> 02:47.027
I don't know. Please.

02:47.078 --> 02:49.162
- I'll fucking kill you right now.
- Please! I don't...

02:49.164 --> 02:51.481
- Where is he?!
- Don't shoot! I didn't do anything!

02:51.516 --> 02:54.201
Are ready to die?! Where is he?!
Right now. Oh, no! I don't...

02:54.252 --> 02:55.502
Please, don't!

03:09.854 --> 03:14.190
I'm sorry, but she's important.

03:23.250 --> 03:24.751
Come on.

03:24.785 --> 03:26.703
Come on, let's go, let's go.

03:26.754 --> 03:28.004
This way.

03:30.207 --> 03:32.509
It's ok.

03:48.359 --> 03:50.360
Come on. I got you.

03:50.394 --> 03:52.028
Ok, go ahead.

03:53.698 --> 03:55.281
Go. Ok.

05:35.248 --> 05:39.134
Hey. Mr. Garvey.

05:39.169 --> 05:41.787
Mr. Garvey, wake up.

05:45.041 --> 05:46.508
Aimee.

05:46.543 --> 05:48.794
Hey.

05:48.796 --> 05:53.132
Aimee, you... You can't be in here.

05:53.183 --> 05:55.134
Shh.

05:55.185 --> 05:57.303
It's ok.

05:59.306 --> 06:01.690
I need you to come with me.

06:01.725 --> 06:04.276
Come on.

06:04.311 --> 06:07.313
He wants you to see.

06:14.204 --> 06:17.156
You have to be quiet or you'll scare them.

06:35.623 --> 06:38.207
What... what are you doing?

06:38.258 --> 06:41.260
Shh. She's right over there.

06:41.295 --> 06:43.880
Do you see her?

06:54.391 --> 06:56.526
Hey, Chief, watch your feet.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.815
Put it out, Paul.

07:02.866 --> 07:05.034
Got a little out of
control, but it'll go out.

07:05.069 --> 07:07.704
Paul, put it out now!

07:07.738 --> 07:09.322
Shit.

07:11.241 --> 07:13.660
What the fuck, Paul!

07:13.711 --> 07:15.995
I told him not to do it here.

07:16.046 --> 07:17.997
Jesus, Ginnie, the heat's out.

07:18.048 --> 07:20.033
Close the goddamn door. Sorry.

07:20.067 --> 07:21.918
Give me that.

07:23.337 --> 07:24.721
My brother's stuff.

07:24.755 --> 07:27.146
Can't you just take it
down to The Goodwill?

07:27.197 --> 07:30.611
So I can see some asshole
wearing his clothes...

07:30.612 --> 07:35.137
- Should I call 9-1-1?
- No! Do not call 9-1-1!

07:36.489 --> 07:38.457
Next time, just put it in the attic.

07:38.491 --> 07:40.943
I don't really want it in the attic.

07:40.977 --> 07:42.411
You owe me a fence.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.046
Ow! Fuck.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.753
You burned his fence down.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.639
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

07:53.673 --> 07:55.774
Who wants French toast?

07:59.312 --> 08:02.264
Has there been any further contact?

08:05.818 --> 08:07.269
Sorry. What?

08:07.271 --> 08:11.273
Your ex-wife, Lauren. Sorry. Laurie.

08:11.275 --> 08:13.275
Have you and she had any further con...

08:13.277 --> 08:14.776
Ahem. We're still married.

08:14.778 --> 08:16.945
Does she think you're married?

08:16.996 --> 08:19.248
You're gonna have to ask her.

08:19.282 --> 08:22.784
I get it, because she doesn't talk.

08:24.954 --> 08:26.922
What's that for?

08:26.956 --> 08:31.293
I work with a lot of kids.
They use it for aggression.

08:32.729 --> 08:37.265
All right, so, um, this
mystery man who shot the deer...

08:37.299 --> 08:39.351
No, he didn't shoot the deer.

08:39.385 --> 08:40.852
I thought...

08:40.886 --> 08:44.556
- No, no, no. No one shot the deer.
- The dogs killed the deer.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.358
Uh, right, sorry.

08:46.392 --> 08:47.976
So the mystery man...

08:48.027 --> 08:50.946
Wait a minute. Why do you keep
calling him "the mystery man"?

08:51.898 --> 08:53.365
You didn't tell me his name.

08:53.399 --> 08:55.484
I don't know his name.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.539
It says here the squad car, um...

09:00.573 --> 09:03.408
Your colleagues arrived in
response to a report of gunshots,

09:03.459 --> 09:08.547
but there's no mention of anyone there
other than you, and lots of dead dogs.

09:08.581 --> 09:10.999
The guy got into his truck and left

09:11.001 --> 09:12.467
before they got there.

09:12.502 --> 09:15.137
So no one else saw him.

09:16.506 --> 09:19.141
I fucking saw him.

09:26.176 --> 09:28.421
_

09:39.979 --> 09:42.314
Soup's on.

09:42.365 --> 09:44.316
Get 'em while you can.

09:44.367 --> 09:46.985
No pancakes in the big house.

09:52.909 --> 09:54.993
Thanks.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.324
Oh, Christ!

10:09.358 --> 10:11.977
Fucking laundry again?

10:28.778 --> 10:30.862
Good morning.

10:54.754 --> 10:57.139
What? You want me to cut it down?

10:59.976 --> 11:04.146
I thought you were bringing me
out here to kill me or something.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.212
Hey, Moonie!

11:38.715 --> 11:40.849
Fuck you!

11:48.891 --> 11:51.860
I know for a fact that
twardoz won't take attendance.

11:51.894 --> 11:53.862
I can't. I have an exam.

11:53.896 --> 11:55.747
- Chicken shit.
- Good morning.

11:55.782 --> 11:58.700
Free of charge. They are
not who you think they are.

12:00.119 --> 12:02.821
You're doing really important work.

12:02.872 --> 12:05.874
Someone needs to tell
that dude about the Internet.

12:05.908 --> 12:08.410
Save us a seat. I'll go order.

12:10.414 --> 12:12.347
- Sorry.
- Oh, no worries.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.134
Thank you.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.769
Sorry.

12:24.260 --> 12:28.980
I may have fucked that barista, so
if he spit in your chai, that's on me.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.182
What?

12:30.233 --> 12:32.851
Do you know who that is?

12:34.270 --> 12:35.437
Nope.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.939
Her name is Nora something.
She was at heroes day.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.609
Her husband and her kids all disappeared.

12:41.994 --> 12:44.112
There's a gun in her purse.

12:44.114 --> 12:45.580
No shit?

12:45.615 --> 12:47.582
Yeah, like, a big one, too.

12:47.617 --> 12:49.418
Not some bullshit lady gun.

12:49.452 --> 12:54.956
She probably puts in her mouth every night
before bed and says, "just one more day."

12:56.259 --> 12:59.127
No, she, like, puts wigs on and uses it

12:59.129 --> 13:01.630
to hold up liquor stores
so she can feel alive again.

13:01.681 --> 13:05.634
Or maybe she actually killed her family
and then just said they disappeared

13:05.685 --> 13:07.219
while she secretly ate their bodies.

13:07.270 --> 13:08.720
That's fucked up.

13:08.771 --> 13:09.971
Yeah.

13:10.022 --> 13:11.390
Heh!

13:19.015 --> 13:21.150
What the fuck?

13:22.402 --> 13:24.353
I'm so sorry.

13:24.355 --> 13:26.522
Oh, um... no worries.

13:26.524 --> 13:27.990
It's totally cool, Mrs. Durst.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.992
- Let me get you another one.
- No, no, it's fine.

13:30.026 --> 13:32.861
- I've got to be somewhere anyway.
- Sorry.

13:34.164 --> 13:35.747
Bye.

13:38.918 --> 13:41.036
Mmm. Ahem.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.541
What was that?

13:52.215 --> 13:54.183
Hey, Nora.

13:54.217 --> 13:56.685
Oh, shit. She's
gonna pop father nutballs.

13:56.719 --> 13:58.854
Good to see you.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.560
Ok. Bye.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.241
You want to follow her?

14:19.292 --> 14:21.243
In what?

14:21.245 --> 14:25.247
- Come on, dude. What?
- Hey! Big bones!

14:26.666 --> 14:28.634
Top of the mornin', ladies.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.469
Y'all need a ride to school?

14:30.503 --> 14:32.504
Only if you let me
drive your awesome prius.

14:32.555 --> 14:34.423
Uh, hop on in, baby.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.091
- You know how to turn it on, right?
- Yeah!

14:36.142 --> 14:37.593
- Ok.
- Go! Quick! Close the door!

14:37.595 --> 14:39.077
It's a hybrid. Hit the
power button. Shut up.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.563
- Do you have a driver's license?
- This is very confusing.

14:41.598 --> 14:44.766
- Brake. You got to hit the...
- Here we go.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.871
Ow! Oh, fuck.

15:05.922 --> 15:07.372
Ow.

15:24.774 --> 15:28.944
So what, the tree's supposed to
symbolize my old life or something?

15:36.903 --> 15:38.987
Can I have one?

15:42.825 --> 15:47.329
You know, you guys are running a pretty
shitty cult if you can't even join.

15:49.933 --> 15:51.237
_

15:51.238 --> 15:52.411
"Not a cult."

15:52.719 --> 15:55.087
Then what is it?

15:59.676 --> 16:01.510
I'm not doing this anymore.

16:03.289 --> 16:04.250
_

16:04.897 --> 16:07.349
Because I don't want to.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.185
Why? Why?

16:10.187 --> 16:13.205
Because I've been with
you people for weeks,

16:13.239 --> 16:19.244
and all I've got is Ron and pancakes
and... and fucking tree-chopping!

16:19.279 --> 16:21.196
What the fuck?!

16:21.198 --> 16:23.532
I mean, it's freezing and it's stupid!

16:23.583 --> 16:27.202
It's fucking stupid! That's why, ok?!

16:28.603 --> 16:29.929
_

17:00.953 --> 17:04.071
Christine, wake up. This is it.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.295
Just stay in the car, ok?

17:52.672 --> 17:54.122
Is it him?

17:54.124 --> 17:56.625
Maybe this isn't the right place.

17:56.627 --> 17:59.344
He should be here by now.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.430
Are you calling him?

18:05.218 --> 18:08.103
No.

18:08.137 --> 18:09.221
Tom.

18:11.407 --> 18:14.526
No, no, no, no. Hey, wait, wait.

18:57.186 --> 18:59.654
Hey,
it's Tom. I'm not here.

18:59.689 --> 19:01.640
God bless.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.158
Hey, Tommy, it's your daddy calling.

19:03.192 --> 19:05.110
I saw you called, so, uh, listen,

19:05.161 --> 19:08.079
I'm gonna leave my phone on,
so call me whenever you can.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.081
I love you. Shit.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.167
Hard to get him to talk to you, right?

19:12.201 --> 19:14.252
Maybe try with the texting.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.538
My 10-year-old,
that's all she uses...

19:16.540 --> 19:18.540
- Where are we on the truck?
- Huh?

19:18.591 --> 19:21.626
Pickup truck I asked you to
find two weeks ago. Where are we?

19:21.677 --> 19:23.595
Oh, yeah.

19:23.629 --> 19:27.048
We... we put out a bolo, but no hits.

19:27.099 --> 19:30.602
Uh, maybe if we had a better
description of the driver?

19:30.636 --> 19:33.555
Big, bald asshole shooting dogs somewhere.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.191
Uh... Want me to sit
down with a sketch artist?

19:36.225 --> 19:37.726
No.

19:37.728 --> 19:41.062
N-no, it's just you're the
only one who saw him, so...

19:41.113 --> 19:43.198
Dennis, do you think I made this guy up?

19:43.232 --> 19:46.902
This is the part where you say, "no,
Chief, that's fucking ridiculous."

19:46.904 --> 19:50.906
Fine. No, Chief. That's...
that's fucking ridiculous.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.241
- Go find the truck.
- Yes, sir.

20:07.056 --> 20:09.140
Patti.

20:10.560 --> 20:11.927
You know the drill.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.179
I have a signed warrant,
applicable in the case

20:14.230 --> 20:16.481
of a missing person or
persons, to enter these premises

20:16.516 --> 20:21.653
and conduct a visual survey and/or
question the occupants therein.

20:21.687 --> 20:24.272
May I come in, please?

20:38.454 --> 20:40.956
Morning, Mr. Jensen. How are you?

20:40.958 --> 20:42.507
Terrific.

20:42.542 --> 20:46.294
Obligated to inform you the missing
persons investigation related to you

20:46.296 --> 20:50.966
has been closed and that your family
has been informed of your whereabouts.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.336
You understand?

20:54.370 --> 20:57.556
Yeah... I understand.

21:09.368 --> 21:10.819
Hi.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.487
Hi.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.491
Did you hurt yourself?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.794
Just some blisters.

21:19.829 --> 21:21.997
You mind if I ask your name?

21:23.416 --> 21:26.167
Meg. Megan Abbott.

21:29.639 --> 21:32.007
You here on your own
free will, miss Abbott?

21:32.058 --> 21:33.675
Yes.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.178
You need my help?

21:41.684 --> 21:43.652
No.

21:46.405 --> 21:48.356
Do you mind if we take a picture?

21:48.407 --> 21:50.859
- A picture?
- Mm-hmm.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.911
Have I done something wrong?

21:52.945 --> 21:54.863
No.

21:54.865 --> 21:56.865
Ok.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.701
- Dennis.
- Yeah, Chief?

21:59.752 --> 22:02.337
Could... ahem.

22:14.216 --> 22:16.184
Ok.

22:16.218 --> 22:18.219
- We good?
- Yeah, it's a good one.

22:18.221 --> 22:19.854
Ok.

22:21.223 --> 22:26.394
If you ever want to talk, uh, we
have resources available to you.

22:26.396 --> 22:29.898
You can feel free to call me, night or day.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.902
Why don't you fucking mail it to me?

23:32.795 --> 23:36.297
- Don't get too close.
- I know what I'm doing.

23:37.683 --> 23:41.136
Uh... we're missing first period.

23:41.138 --> 23:44.305
Jill is never gonna fuck you if you
keep acting like such a puss, dude.

23:44.307 --> 23:45.523
Ow! What?

23:45.558 --> 23:47.058
Did I mix them up?

23:47.109 --> 23:48.977
Shut up.

23:52.064 --> 23:55.483
Oh, yeah, here we go.

24:07.096 --> 24:09.330
Why are we following her?

24:09.332 --> 24:12.500
Because she's fucking dangerous.

24:19.425 --> 24:21.342
- Mr. Patterson?
- Uh-huh.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.845
We spoke on the phone
last week. I'm Nora Durst.

24:23.847 --> 24:27.432
Oh. I'm here to give you and
your wife your departure benefit.

24:27.483 --> 24:29.851
Uh, I... come in.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.020
Thank you.

24:34.690 --> 24:37.192
This guy is in the pledge house now.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.694
No idea where he came from.

24:39.745 --> 24:41.996
"Brandon" might be an alias.

24:42.031 --> 24:44.532
Wouldn't give us a last name.

24:46.202 --> 24:48.036
Got her. Megan Abbott.

24:48.087 --> 24:52.807
From here in town. Fiancée
reported a missing couples weeks ago.

24:55.997 --> 24:58.667
Ask him to come in. I'll handle it.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.535
Jesus. I never should have
told you to watch the fucking "Wire".

25:06.709 --> 25:08.293
Lucy.

25:09.044 --> 25:12.963
Gentlemen, you mind giving
the Chief and I a moment?

25:13.415 --> 25:14.585
Yeah.

25:17.302 --> 25:18.920
Madam mayor.

25:23.091 --> 25:27.445
Kevin, were you inside a
G.R. Residence earlier today?

25:27.479 --> 25:29.814
I was serving a missing persons
warrant. I do that every couple weeks.

25:29.848 --> 25:32.433
Uh-huh. And would you say the climate

25:32.484 --> 25:35.319
has changed somewhat since
you went over there drunk

25:35.354 --> 25:37.905
and punched one of them in the face?

25:37.940 --> 25:39.857
I think I punched him
in the stomach, actually.

25:39.908 --> 25:41.325
Want a bagel?

25:41.360 --> 25:43.945
Kevin, I'm trying to help you.

25:43.947 --> 25:45.997
By forcing me to get
cleared by some dipshit

25:46.031 --> 25:48.699
because I had a rough night?

25:48.750 --> 25:51.953
"Rough night"? You are
aware that people like dogs?

25:51.955 --> 25:53.120
I like dogs.

25:53.171 --> 25:57.174
Then stop fucking shooting them because
that's something crazy people do.

25:59.295 --> 26:01.245
You want to get cleared?

26:01.280 --> 26:03.848
Then you tell that dipshit
what he needs to hear.

26:03.882 --> 26:05.349
What's that?

26:05.384 --> 26:07.301
It won't happen again.

26:07.303 --> 26:09.804
Well, I can't say that
'cause I don't mean it.

26:09.855 --> 26:13.691
They're not our dogs. Not anymore.

26:13.725 --> 26:15.977
What the fuck does that mean?

26:20.817 --> 26:26.487
Kevin, I need you to stop pissing
on the G.R.'S front porch, ok?

26:26.489 --> 26:27.938
Fine.

26:27.973 --> 26:30.124
See if I can hold it.

26:35.080 --> 26:37.715
I'm visiting tonight, so...

26:44.473 --> 26:47.091
Tell him I said hi.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.504
Fuck.

27:31.436 --> 27:33.854
You have to film us?

27:33.889 --> 27:35.940
It's ridiculous, right?

27:35.974 --> 27:38.442
I guess some people were
filling it out wrong.

27:38.477 --> 27:40.561
That's why they're making
us conduct it verbally now.

27:40.612 --> 27:42.613
How many questions is it?

27:42.647 --> 27:46.067
Just over 150. Too many, I know.

27:46.069 --> 27:49.403
Do we have to answer
everything to get our... check?

27:49.454 --> 27:51.706
Just what you can.

27:54.876 --> 27:56.293
Ok.

27:56.328 --> 27:59.914
This is Nora Durst, ID 42ECN.

27:59.965 --> 28:04.048
Today I will be conducting a benefit
release questionnaire for case file 77123,

28:04.049 --> 28:07.615
Chales Patterson, age 34 at T.O.E.

28:07.617 --> 28:10.618
Present are Louis and
Marie, the parents of.

28:10.669 --> 28:14.672
I can refer to him as "Charles," as
"your son," or as "the departed"...

28:14.706 --> 28:16.206
Charlie.

28:16.257 --> 28:18.342
All right. Charlie.

28:20.211 --> 28:22.129
I apologize in advance.

28:22.180 --> 28:24.465
The questions can be
strange for some people.

28:24.516 --> 28:27.134
Were you able to look them
over? There was a link...

28:27.136 --> 28:28.852
Let's just get it over with.

28:28.887 --> 28:30.471
Ok.

28:32.357 --> 28:35.142
To your knowledge, did Charlie
have any food allergies?

28:35.144 --> 28:36.777
We sent in his medical records.

28:36.811 --> 28:39.563
I know, and I'm sorry. I'm
not given access to those.

28:39.614 --> 28:41.315
No allergies.

28:41.366 --> 28:43.283
Ok.

28:43.318 --> 28:46.320
To your knowledge, did
Charlie ever travel to Brazil?

28:46.322 --> 28:48.656
No.

28:48.658 --> 28:51.375
To your knowledge, did
Charlie enjoy cooking?

28:51.409 --> 28:53.327
No.

28:53.329 --> 28:56.330
To your knowledge, did Charlie
speak more than one language?

28:56.332 --> 28:59.667
My son had Down Syndrome.

29:01.002 --> 29:03.137
I'm sorry.

29:04.472 --> 29:08.175
I am. These questions, they're f...

29:12.026 --> 29:14.561
I know this is hard.

29:14.612 --> 29:18.648
Answer what you can,
but I have to ask them.

29:18.650 --> 29:21.200
All of them.

29:21.235 --> 29:23.653
No...

29:23.655 --> 29:26.990
He didn't speak more than one language.

29:26.992 --> 29:28.625
Ok.

29:31.912 --> 29:37.634
To your knowledge, did Charlie
have more than 20 sexual partners?

29:40.638 --> 29:43.923
Do you have any hand cream?

29:43.974 --> 29:46.342
What?

29:46.393 --> 29:50.647
Do you have any hand cream?

29:50.681 --> 29:53.266
I'm a man. Why would I have hand cream?

29:53.300 --> 29:55.351
You're a man?

29:56.737 --> 29:58.821
I'll bet she does.

30:02.026 --> 30:05.528
But if you get caught, you will be shot.

30:08.699 --> 30:11.367
Oh, my God, guys. Are you serious?

30:17.541 --> 30:20.209
She's a really bad influence on you, man.

30:26.617 --> 30:28.718
Jesus, lady.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.218
Oh, mmm., yes.

30:47.821 --> 30:49.288
Ok.

30:51.325 --> 30:52.742
Jill!

30:52.744 --> 30:54.711
Jill, don't do it!

30:59.250 --> 31:02.635
Stop, stop, stop. Jill, stop it.

31:02.670 --> 31:05.254
- Stop.
- Shut up!

31:05.305 --> 31:07.974
Go! Oh, my God! You stupid
bitch! You're gonna... go!

31:08.008 --> 31:09.342
Hit the power button.

31:09.393 --> 31:11.344
Oh, my God. Just turn on the car.

31:11.395 --> 31:13.763
Just go. She's right there. Just go.

31:13.814 --> 31:15.431
She's right outside.

31:48.015 --> 31:51.968
Chief, the fiancée is here.
Waiting in your office.

31:51.970 --> 31:55.138
Oh, right, yeah. Thanks.

32:00.644 --> 32:02.612
Mr. Finnerty.

32:02.646 --> 32:05.064
Kevin Garvey. Thank you for coming in.

32:05.115 --> 32:07.650
So sorry you had to
wait. You can have a seat.

32:07.652 --> 32:09.118
Jesus.

32:09.153 --> 32:13.072
You people leave me a
voice-mail regarding my fiancée,

32:13.123 --> 32:16.826
and when I call back, nobody will
tell me if she's alive or dead.

32:16.877 --> 32:18.828
Megan's with the Guilty Remnant.

32:18.879 --> 32:20.630
What?

32:20.664 --> 32:25.134
I'm assuming they've been
following Megan for some time now.

32:25.169 --> 32:28.671
- They usually target somebody and then...
- What do they want?

32:28.722 --> 32:30.723
That depends who you ask.

32:30.758 --> 32:33.259
I'm asking you.

32:33.310 --> 32:39.182
Well, uh, they say they want to
remind people of what happened.

32:39.233 --> 32:42.351
But what do they want?
They want to recruit.

32:43.737 --> 32:48.074
Look, the good news is that right now,
Megan's in what we call the pledge house.

32:48.108 --> 32:51.027
It's like a... Like an orientation.

32:51.078 --> 32:54.747
They don't have to wear white
yet, they can still talk.

32:56.116 --> 32:59.085
I spoke to Megan today personally.

32:59.119 --> 33:02.088
I've dealt with a lot of these people.

33:02.122 --> 33:07.593
I got a feeling that with Megan,
maybe she's still on the fence.

33:14.768 --> 33:17.887
I think you could still
convince her to come home.

33:27.147 --> 33:29.732
Why would I do that?

33:31.118 --> 33:33.119
Sorry?

33:33.153 --> 33:37.740
Why... Would I do that?

33:39.626 --> 33:42.745
Because she needs you right now.

33:44.214 --> 33:46.632
She...

33:46.667 --> 33:49.252
Needs?

33:55.759 --> 33:59.228
I postponed my wedding for 3
years because of what she needs.

33:59.263 --> 34:01.764
But she snuck off in the
middle of the fucking night

34:01.766 --> 34:03.766
so she could be with them!

34:03.768 --> 34:07.570
And she needs them! The fucking ghosts!

34:09.907 --> 34:13.025
What the fuck are you talkin' about, man?

34:31.795 --> 34:33.262
What, Dennis?

34:33.297 --> 34:36.382
Hey, Chief, I found the truck.

34:36.433 --> 34:38.351
Where?

34:38.385 --> 34:41.520
It's, uh, in your driveway.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.947
Hey.

34:51.982 --> 34:56.619
Saw it when I was driving
by, called you first thing.

35:05.212 --> 35:07.163
Keys are on the dash.

35:07.214 --> 35:09.165
Yeah, I noticed that.

35:09.216 --> 35:10.833
Did you run the vin?

35:10.835 --> 35:14.003
Uh-huh. No registration, no wants.

35:20.894 --> 35:24.013
I looked inside. It's a dead dog.

35:25.716 --> 35:28.985
I'll just say we found it
abandoned a couple blocks from here.

35:30.354 --> 35:32.855
Why the fuck would you say that?

35:32.857 --> 35:35.358
Well, it's just... I...

35:35.360 --> 35:37.910
It's not my truck, Dennis.

35:37.945 --> 35:40.496
Someone else put it here.

35:40.530 --> 35:42.949
Uh, yeah. Sure.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.368
I know.

35:54.344 --> 35:56.295
Get back to work.

35:56.346 --> 35:57.947
Yes, sir.

36:36.253 --> 36:38.921
He never would have let me
do that when he was alive.

36:40.924 --> 36:42.391
You ok?

36:42.426 --> 36:44.427
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. You?

36:44.429 --> 36:49.015
Well, Tom, I've had better days.

36:49.066 --> 36:50.566
Yeah.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.269
Um, what happened back there?

36:53.271 --> 36:56.272
They had papers, some bullshit.

36:56.274 --> 36:58.741
They didn't come to arrest me.

36:58.775 --> 37:01.861
They opened fire before
they even got to the house.

37:03.246 --> 37:05.448
Christine told me what you did.

37:07.834 --> 37:11.120
Yeah, you told
me to protect her, right?

37:14.041 --> 37:18.094
Don't just shrug like you're not
sure what you want for supper, man.

37:18.128 --> 37:20.212
You killed.

37:22.299 --> 37:25.434
For great purpose, yes, but you killed.

37:27.904 --> 37:30.806
You're a good boy, Tom. It's ok.

37:30.857 --> 37:35.211
And that's why it feels like
there's poison inside you right now.

37:35.245 --> 37:39.682
And it's gonna burn till you're hollow.

37:39.716 --> 37:42.151
Let me take it from you, man.

37:50.827 --> 37:53.496
You don't have to feel like this anymore.

37:57.667 --> 37:59.251
Come on in.

38:06.476 --> 38:08.427
I can't.

38:08.478 --> 38:10.596
I can't.

38:13.733 --> 38:17.686
You're the one motherfucker
I can't figure out.

38:17.737 --> 38:21.690
You're all suffering and no salvation.

38:21.692 --> 38:26.695
But that's why I chose
you to protect our girl.

38:29.416 --> 38:31.333
I'm glad you're back together.

38:31.368 --> 38:34.870
No, no, Tom, she... She can't come with me.

38:36.673 --> 38:38.874
She's going with you.

38:56.726 --> 38:59.778
Thanks for letting
us hijack your ride, boners.

38:59.813 --> 39:01.230
Anytime.

39:01.281 --> 39:03.282
Hey, get some fucking hand cream.

39:03.316 --> 39:05.451
Have a good night.

39:05.485 --> 39:07.570
You, too.

39:10.540 --> 39:13.909
So, you think she's
really gonna use that gun?

39:13.960 --> 39:16.462
If I lost my whole family,
I'd need to shoot something.

39:16.496 --> 39:18.497
At least she's still here.

39:18.548 --> 39:20.966
What do you mean?

39:21.001 --> 39:24.003
She could have run away
someplace and nobody

39:24.054 --> 39:27.223
would have ever known what happened
to her, but she's still here.

39:31.761 --> 39:33.896
These jellybeans are stale.

39:36.266 --> 39:38.901
They were probably for her kids.

39:56.953 --> 39:59.088
Hi.

40:02.492 --> 40:04.093
Oh.

40:05.512 --> 40:07.596
Do we have to?

40:14.838 --> 40:19.808
Please, can we just have one night where
I don't have to give you any of my stuff?

40:21.394 --> 40:22.978
One night?

40:38.411 --> 40:42.581
Do you even remember what it
feels like to care about anything?

40:54.709 --> 40:57.174
_

40:58.398 --> 41:00.432
What?

41:09.693 --> 41:11.610
No shit?

41:11.661 --> 41:13.696
The hot cop?

41:15.081 --> 41:17.700
And you're here?

41:57.540 --> 42:00.125
It's my mom's.

42:03.463 --> 42:06.582
I was saving it for last.

42:14.924 --> 42:18.093
I don't want to feel this way anymore.

42:32.492 --> 42:37.946
She's far too important to
risk traveling with me right now.

42:37.948 --> 42:43.452
Never stay in the same place for too long,
don't ever tell anyone your real name,

42:43.503 --> 42:46.004
and don't use your ids.
Have you got a phone?

42:46.039 --> 42:49.291
- Yeah.
- Give it to me.

42:59.637 --> 43:04.973
When it's time for what comes
next, I'll call you on this.

43:05.024 --> 43:08.026
Oh, and get yourself a
charger, man. I lost mine.

43:08.061 --> 43:10.446
Wayne, we have to go.

43:13.983 --> 43:15.984
I love you.

43:15.986 --> 43:18.620
I love you, too.

43:31.885 --> 43:34.386
This girl is everything.

43:34.421 --> 43:36.388
Yes?

43:36.423 --> 43:38.507
Yes.

44:09.956 --> 44:11.874
Road trip.

44:22.802 --> 44:24.770
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

44:24.804 --> 44:26.805
Fuck! Fuck!

44:26.856 --> 44:29.942
Fuuuu-uuck!

44:38.785 --> 44:40.903
It's gonna be ok.

44:42.789 --> 44:44.740
How?

44:47.377 --> 44:49.411
Wayne told me.

45:29.118 --> 45:31.253
Howdy.

45:32.956 --> 45:36.124
Well, you gonna invite me in?

45:39.879 --> 45:42.347
What's your pickup truck
doing in my driveway?

45:42.382 --> 45:44.216
I heard you were looking for it.

45:44.267 --> 45:46.218
Heard where?

45:46.269 --> 45:48.470
Around.

45:52.559 --> 45:53.976
What's your name?

45:53.978 --> 45:57.145
Well, you asking me in an
official capacity or as a friend?

45:57.196 --> 45:59.648
We're not friends.

45:59.699 --> 46:02.184
Then I'd rather not say.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.991
Hey, Mr. Garvey.

46:09.042 --> 46:11.493
- Hey.
- These for us?

46:11.495 --> 46:14.913
Young lady, why don't you put
this in the fridge for your dad?

46:14.964 --> 46:17.549
Do not drink that.

46:18.918 --> 46:21.553
So I found another pack.

46:23.339 --> 46:24.973
Of what?

46:26.309 --> 46:28.226
Dogs.

46:28.261 --> 46:30.729
Couple dozen, I'd guess.

46:30.763 --> 46:35.684
I saw them slinking around the
elementary school tonight, and they...

46:35.735 --> 46:38.186
I'm pretty sure they're
sleeping in the drainpipe.

46:38.237 --> 46:42.074
We could set up there and pick them
off when they come out tomorrow night.

46:42.108 --> 46:45.527
You meet my by the school
just before sundown?

46:46.863 --> 46:49.531
Why can't you do it yourself?

46:51.117 --> 46:53.201
'Cause I'm lonely.

47:00.543 --> 47:02.761
Sundown tomorrow.

47:02.795 --> 47:05.464
We're doing the Lord's
work, believe you me.

47:10.887 --> 47:12.854
Hey!

47:12.889 --> 47:15.023
Take your fucking truck.

47:16.392 --> 47:19.227
No, it's all yours. I'm done with it.

47:35.069 --> 47:36.224
Who was that?

47:37.914 --> 47:39.498
Nobody.

47:47.974 --> 47:49.941
Hey, Betty. How you doing?

47:49.976 --> 47:52.594
Mr. Garvey. Long time no see.

47:52.596 --> 47:54.229
Yeah.

47:55.348 --> 47:56.898
Ok if I bring that in?

47:56.933 --> 47:59.101
Long as he eats it while you're
here and you bring the jar out.

47:59.152 --> 48:00.769
Deal.

48:06.777 --> 48:08.910
Yeah.

48:12.782 --> 48:15.784
How can he not
like this? Oh, it's great.

48:28.297 --> 48:30.932
Prodigal son returns.

48:32.268 --> 48:34.970
I'll, uh, let you two catch up.

48:34.972 --> 48:36.605
Ok.

48:39.475 --> 48:41.109
Kevin.

48:42.445 --> 48:46.148
Hey... ahem... did you
steal my bagels this morning?

48:46.150 --> 48:48.233
- Did I what?
- Never mind.

48:48.284 --> 48:50.068
Forget about it.

48:53.206 --> 48:55.157
How you doing, dad?

48:56.660 --> 48:58.827
Said you got to eat it while I'm here.

48:58.829 --> 49:01.413
Yeah, yeah. I know the rules.

49:08.004 --> 49:11.506
Did she... did she tell
you what's going on with me?

49:11.557 --> 49:14.676
Oh, we got better things
to talk about than you.

49:14.678 --> 49:16.812
Mmm.

49:20.099 --> 49:22.017
How's my house?

49:22.019 --> 49:25.070
Paul burned down the fence in the backyard.

49:25.104 --> 49:28.223
Eh, fuckin' moron.

49:29.609 --> 49:31.860
How's my job?

49:33.162 --> 49:35.197
It's hard.

49:37.116 --> 49:39.034
You know...

49:39.085 --> 49:44.256
It wouldn't kill you to show a
little vulnerability now and then.

49:44.290 --> 49:46.541
People love that shit.

49:46.543 --> 49:51.713
No one wants to see the Chief
of police crying in his car.

49:51.764 --> 49:54.850
You're crying in your car?

49:58.387 --> 50:00.889
You know they all went?

50:00.891 --> 50:06.895
Balki, cousin Larry, Jennifer, Mary
Anne... whole cast poof ed on the 14th.

50:06.946 --> 50:09.481
Bullshit.

50:09.532 --> 50:10.982
No, look it up.

50:13.536 --> 50:15.453
Kids ok?

50:15.488 --> 50:17.956
Yeah. Jill, she's fine.

50:17.990 --> 50:20.458
Tommy's still out west, I think.

50:20.493 --> 50:22.911
Been a while since we spoke.

50:22.962 --> 50:27.465
Well, just because he doesn't
check in as often as he should

50:27.500 --> 50:30.635
doesn't mean he doesn't love you.

50:34.974 --> 50:37.926
How'd it start for you, dad?

50:37.928 --> 50:42.430
Well, that depends on
what you mean by "it," son.

50:42.432 --> 50:44.766
You know what I'm talking about.

50:44.768 --> 50:49.905
If you're asking me when
I started losing my shit...

50:51.240 --> 50:54.242
Contrary to the professional
opinion of others,

50:54.277 --> 50:57.612
I maintain my shit remains intact.

50:57.614 --> 51:03.835
Now, I'd venture to guess the
reason you're here seeing me...

51:03.870 --> 51:07.289
Your shit may be gettin' lost.

51:07.340 --> 51:11.793
No, not an... not an unreasonable
assumption, considering you've been

51:11.844 --> 51:14.512
running around shooting dogs in
the middle of the fuckin' night.

51:14.547 --> 51:16.514
- Fuckin' Lucy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

51:16.549 --> 51:18.516
Don't take it out on her.

51:18.551 --> 51:21.102
She's trying to cover for you.

51:21.137 --> 51:27.108
Why don't you tell that shrink
she sent you to that you were drunk

51:27.143 --> 51:33.281
and that you were under a lot of
stress, and you're very, very sorry?

51:33.316 --> 51:36.284
You realize now that it was wrong to...

51:36.319 --> 51:39.654
Will you please shut up?

51:40.990 --> 51:43.825
No, no, I'm not gonna tell him.

51:45.211 --> 51:46.478
Tell me what, dad?

51:46.512 --> 51:47.996
He's here, isn't he?

51:47.998 --> 51:49.965
That's something.

51:49.999 --> 51:53.501
Why do I always have to...

51:53.503 --> 51:55.637
Oh, fuck you!

51:59.225 --> 52:01.343
Someone came to see you?

52:04.764 --> 52:06.231
What?

52:06.265 --> 52:08.850
They said they sent...

52:08.852 --> 52:10.819
Oh, motherfucker.

52:10.853 --> 52:16.191
They said they sent or are
sending somebody to help you.

52:17.576 --> 52:20.695
Who? Uh, help me with what?

52:25.534 --> 52:28.536
Ah, I don't know.

52:30.540 --> 52:32.624
But...

52:32.675 --> 52:39.264
Whatever it is, you might
want to keep it to yourself.

52:47.139 --> 52:49.140
Hey, Chief, you good?

52:49.175 --> 52:50.275
Fantastic.
