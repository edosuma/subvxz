02:14.042 --> 02:15.703
Falcon2, this is Lead.

02:15.977 --> 02:17.808
Unidentified aircraft approaching.

02:18.046 --> 02:21.174
<i>Keep In formatlon tlll I
<i>flnd out what they want.</i></i>

02:23.151 --> 02:24.709
Bandits ten o'clock high.

02:24.919 --> 02:26.443
Looks like MiG-23s.

02:26.654 --> 02:28.815
Climb to 23,000 feet.

02:29.057 --> 02:30.649
<i>I want to keep an angle on hlm.</i>

02:32.493 --> 02:33.824
<i>Attentlon, Amerlcan Invaders...</i>

02:34.696 --> 02:37.290
<i>... you are vlolatlng</i>
<i>our terrltorlal alrspace.</i>

02:37.498 --> 02:38.692
What are they talking about?

02:38.900 --> 02:41.630
This is Colonel Ted Masters
of the U.S. Air Force.

02:41.836 --> 02:42.825
We're on a routine exer...

02:43.871 --> 02:46.601
Pitch out! They're firing on us!
This is no drill!

02:46.808 --> 02:48.537
<i>Flre when you get a lock on hlm.</i>

02:50.978 --> 02:53.344
<i>Two MIGs.</i> 4 <i>o'clock.</i>
<i>Watch your tall.</i>

02:54.015 --> 02:56.279
I'm coming around.
I'll pick up the leader.

02:56.484 --> 02:58.918
<i>Got you covered.</i>
<i>Angle's looklng good.</i>

02:59.854 --> 03:01.822
<i>Watch that bandlt</i>
<i>at 2 o'clock.</i>

03:12.233 --> 03:13.666
Okay, palsy.

03:18.106 --> 03:19.937
<i>Bandlt turnlng In tlght.</i>

03:21.776 --> 03:22.834
Closing in on bandit.

03:23.044 --> 03:25.535
<i>On your tall, Lleutenant.</i>
<i>Pull It up.</i>

03:25.747 --> 03:27.578
<i>Pull It up.</i>
<i>Pull It up!</i>

03:27.782 --> 03:29.773
I've been hit!
I'm dropping fuel fast!

03:30.017 --> 03:32.315
<i>Get the hell</i>
<i>out of there, now!</i>

03:32.520 --> 03:34.511

<i>- Move lt!</i>

03:34.722 --> 03:37.213
<i>Afflrmatlve. Headlng back</i>
<i>to base. Good luck.</i>

03:50.605 --> 03:52.129
Check in behind you, sucker.

03:54.909 --> 03:56.103
That's it. Come on.

03:59.413 --> 04:00.277
Thank you.

04:03.151 --> 04:04.243
Four to one.

04:04.485 --> 04:06.646
<i>These guys aren't taklng</i>
<i>any chances.</i>

05:00.208 --> 05:01.402
Come on, Matt.
Let's go.

05:02.643 --> 05:03.803
Let's go.

05:04.045 --> 05:07.674
Get off the phone! We had to meet
Tony and Reggie 20 minutes ago.

05:07.882 --> 05:11.477
Quit bugging me!
I'm talking to Sheila Tallucci.

05:12.220 --> 05:14.882
She's a junior.
Why are you messing with her?

05:16.023 --> 05:18.287
Hold on.
She thinks I am too.

05:18.726 --> 05:20.717
Now get out.
You're blowing it for me.

05:21.062 --> 05:23.223
I'll take the Honda
and meet you guys later.

05:23.731 --> 05:26.564
I thought Dad told you
not to ride that Honda off base.

05:27.735 --> 05:29.965
How's he going to know
if he's not around?

05:30.171 --> 05:32.162
Now disappear before
I have to pound you!

05:35.910 --> 05:37.741
It's my little brother.

05:37.945 --> 05:39.435
You know how kids are.

05:39.647 --> 05:41.911
I'm leaving, Mom.
You'll pick up my tux?

05:42.116 --> 05:43.140
At 12:00.

05:43.584 --> 05:46.712
Doug, could you tell your sister
how nice she looks?

05:47.255 --> 05:48.745
She does look nice.

05:49.090 --> 05:50.216
I look gross.

05:50.424 --> 05:52.756
You don't have to wear this
after tomorrow.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.689
Your brother only graduates once.

05:54.929 --> 05:57.227
It's a miracle
he's graduating at all.

05:57.531 --> 05:58.862
Thanks a lot, runt.

06:00.801 --> 06:03.429
Be home by 6:00.
Your dad's going to call in.

06:03.638 --> 06:07.233
He wants to say hi to you and Katie
before the prom tonight.

06:07.441 --> 06:10.069
Not waiting for the mail?
Today could be the day.

06:10.278 --> 06:11.267
I'm late.

07:03.497 --> 07:05.089
Are you out of your mind!?

07:05.299 --> 07:06.926
Ten miles an hour!

07:30.491 --> 07:34.518
How do you like the moves?
Been practicing for the prom tonight.

07:34.862 --> 07:35.920
You guys look great.

07:36.130 --> 07:37.495
I'm sorry I'm late, but...

07:37.698 --> 07:39.222
Enjoy it, fool.

07:39.433 --> 07:42.800
Pretty soon, if you don't show up
on time, they'll shoot your behind.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.973
At the Academy, the word "tardy"
is not in the vocabulary.

08:05.493 --> 08:06.460
What were they doing?

08:06.660 --> 08:08.992
They came up behind me on the bridge.

08:10.865 --> 08:11.832
Bastards!

08:14.068 --> 08:15.558
What is it with you, Knotcher?

08:15.770 --> 08:19.206
Can't you get through a day
without proving you're an asshole?

08:19.407 --> 08:22.137
I was just having a little fun
with your girlfriend.

08:22.343 --> 08:24.971
I figured maybe she'd realize
she deserves more from life...

08:25.179 --> 08:27.079
...than some pussy Air Force brat.

08:28.916 --> 08:30.508
D., just...

08:30.718 --> 08:33.551
...forget about this big,
nasty, moose-lipped greaseball.

08:33.754 --> 08:35.244
He wants to get you in trouble.

08:35.523 --> 08:39.357
If the sheriff hears you been
fighting again, he'll put you in jail.

08:39.592 --> 08:41.686
D., just chill.

08:42.096 --> 08:43.756
I'm losing patience with you.

08:44.097 --> 08:46.566
I'm losing patience with you.

08:46.767 --> 08:49.827
It'd be easy to settle this
if you had any balls.

08:50.037 --> 08:51.334
Just run the Snake with me.

08:51.705 --> 08:54.230
You're a broken record.
You got Snake on the brain.

08:54.442 --> 08:56.239
Didn't you learn nothing
from last time?

09:04.452 --> 09:06.750
We love your jackets, boys.

09:06.954 --> 09:08.512
Have a nice day.

09:09.490 --> 09:11.549
He's the biggest creep.

09:11.959 --> 09:13.187
No kidding.

09:13.394 --> 09:15.919
That guy's bullshit
hasn't changed in 4 years.

09:16.130 --> 09:17.529
Neither has his breath.

09:17.731 --> 09:19.631
He'd kill you with it.

09:19.834 --> 09:22.428
- It came right after you left.
- What is it?

09:22.937 --> 09:25.371
Does the return address
"U.S. Air Force Academy...

09:25.573 --> 09:27.632
...in Colorado Springs"
give you a clue?

09:27.975 --> 09:29.067
Drum roll.

09:30.211 --> 09:34.477
The best new applicant for the
Pilot Training Program is...

09:38.819 --> 09:40.377
Not Doug Masters.

09:40.988 --> 09:41.977
What did it say?

09:44.525 --> 09:45.549
It said all that...

09:45.993 --> 09:47.585
..."We regret to inform you" crap.

09:47.828 --> 09:49.318
It said I didn't qualify.

09:50.831 --> 09:53.163
Guess you had to
kind of expect it.

09:53.367 --> 09:54.334
Maybe I didn't.

09:54.535 --> 09:57.504
Let's face it, Doug.
With the grade point average?

09:57.838 --> 10:00.033
We're talking
subterranean range here.

10:00.241 --> 10:01.731
Just because of one lousy "F."

10:01.942 --> 10:04.433
And I only got it because
I always had to cut class...

10:04.645 --> 10:05.976
...to sneak in the simulator.

10:06.180 --> 10:07.408
<i>Good mornlng.</i>

10:07.615 --> 10:09.310
<i>I have an announcement...</i>

10:09.517 --> 10:11.815
<i>... of speclal Interest</i>
<i>to you mllltary personnel.</i>

10:12.453 --> 10:13.442
Little Dougie Masters...

10:13.654 --> 10:17.317
<i>... has regretfully been denled</i>
<i>admlsslon to the Alr Force Academy.</i>

10:17.691 --> 10:18.487
Too bad.

10:19.593 --> 10:23.085
<i>He would've looked so cute</i>
<i>In hls llttle unlform and halrcut...</i>

10:23.330 --> 10:25.195
...marching around
with the other fairies.

10:27.101 --> 10:28.500
What's the matter, flybaby?

10:30.471 --> 10:31.995
You're dead.

10:32.206 --> 10:34.697
I'll wait till you come out.
Then you're mine.

10:35.109 --> 10:38.169
If we fight, you have
to deal with the sheriff.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.980
If we race, it's just
the mountains and me.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.345
You got it.
Be at Mclntyre's in an hour.

10:46.353 --> 10:49.151
Have Raymond gas up my plane.
I'm flying the Snake.

10:49.356 --> 10:52.848
Doug, you'll get killed!
Just like Jimmy Branson did.

11:18.185 --> 11:19.413
Excuse me.

11:20.421 --> 11:21.752
Excuse me!

11:22.256 --> 11:24.520
Will you hand me
that Phillips head?

11:25.459 --> 11:27.393
Why are you working
on my plane?

11:27.595 --> 11:29.995
The Phillips head, boy.
The Phillips head.

11:32.132 --> 11:35.124
What are you doing working on
my plane? Raymond was...

11:35.336 --> 11:36.394
You're flying the Snake.

11:36.604 --> 11:37.571
How'd you know?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.208
Why are you making
my mixture so rich?

11:41.408 --> 11:43.638
How low you have to keep it
to the ground?

11:43.877 --> 11:45.435
50 feet. Why?

11:45.779 --> 11:48.213
Because lean as you were running,
if it stalled...

11:48.415 --> 11:51.441
...you'd have lost your engine and
never been able to pull it out.

11:51.785 --> 11:53.275
That's what happened to Jimmy.

11:53.621 --> 11:55.521
It happened to
the Branson kid, all right.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.186
He didn't know that, either.

11:58.158 --> 12:01.355
They sure couldn't tell him after
they peeled him off that cliff.

12:04.231 --> 12:05.220
What do I owe you?

12:06.567 --> 12:08.432
We can talk about that later.

12:09.036 --> 12:10.298
If you come back.

12:13.641 --> 12:15.438
According to the rules
of the Snake...

12:15.643 --> 12:18.009
...Doug can take any route
through the mountains...

12:18.212 --> 12:21.045
...as long as he sticks under the
50-foot height limit.

12:21.482 --> 12:24.280
Knotcher, you got to stick
to the main road.

12:24.485 --> 12:27.648
You'll loop through Dragon Canyon
and end up back here.

12:28.422 --> 12:32.290
Who will make sure Masters doesn't
pull up if he gets scared?

12:32.493 --> 12:33.926
If he pulls up...

12:34.128 --> 12:35.288
...he's disqualified.

12:35.496 --> 12:38.863
Packer and Brillo can ride monitor
with me and Reggie.

12:39.066 --> 12:39.964
Let's do it.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.662
Good luck. I'm climbing.

13:25.446 --> 13:26.970
That music is jamming!

13:27.214 --> 13:28.579
<i>Dance to those rocks!</i>

13:34.021 --> 13:35.283
How's he doing?

13:35.489 --> 13:36.615
Let's put it this way:

13:36.824 --> 13:39.054
My stomach hurts
from watching this guy fly.

13:47.901 --> 13:49.391
What's with Knotcher?

13:49.670 --> 13:51.968
He almost started
a new career...

13:52.172 --> 13:53.537
<i>... as a hood ornament.</i>

14:10.190 --> 14:12.420
He should just land on the
fool and get it over with.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.557
Don't you feel like flying today?

14:14.995 --> 14:16.462
Flying, yes.

14:16.663 --> 14:17.721
Dying, no.

14:30.177 --> 14:31.667
That's not the main road.

14:31.879 --> 14:33.369
A road's a road.

14:33.781 --> 14:36.045
That'll take 10 minutes
off his time.

14:36.283 --> 14:39.980
<i>He's cuttlng through on the flre road.</i>
<i>No way you can beat hlm now.</i>

14:40.187 --> 14:41.017
It ain't over yet.

14:41.455 --> 14:43.685
You're coming up on Devil's Face.

14:43.891 --> 14:45.791
<i>That's where Jlmmy Branson bought lt.</i>

14:57.204 --> 14:57.932
You did it!

14:59.807 --> 15:00.796
<i>Come on!</i>

15:01.008 --> 15:02.839
<i>Reggle, would you</i>
<i>glve me a break?</i>

15:15.389 --> 15:16.185
Pull up!

15:18.559 --> 15:21.426
Man, you're toying with death.
You know that, right?

15:29.770 --> 15:31.795
Keep jamming to the tunes.
You're zooming!

15:42.749 --> 15:44.478
Smoke's pouring out of your manifold!

15:47.187 --> 15:48.484
I'm losing oil pressure.

15:48.689 --> 15:50.589
Shut her down!
You'll seize your engine!

15:54.261 --> 15:57.025
Wonder what a Cessna looks
like splattered on the rocks.

15:57.231 --> 15:59.495
What did you do
to his engine, you freak!

15:59.700 --> 16:03.033
Knotcher made me do it.
He had me adjust his oil cap.

16:03.237 --> 16:05.000
Packer loosened your pressure cap.

16:05.205 --> 16:06.263
<i>Land the plane!</i>

16:06.473 --> 16:07.337
Land the plane!

16:07.541 --> 16:09.475
Stop acting crazy!
You'll get killed!

16:20.487 --> 16:21.647
Easy.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.526
Coming up on Knotcher.

16:34.968 --> 16:35.957
I can beat him.

16:36.169 --> 16:38.330
Don't be a fool!
Just land!

16:38.539 --> 16:39.403
Land the plane.

16:59.660 --> 17:01.059
Don't stall on me now.

17:09.036 --> 17:10.195
Go! Go! Go!

17:10.404 --> 17:12.269
You got him!
Now take it home!

18:02.289 --> 18:03.256
Shit.

18:12.099 --> 18:13.498
Rough landing, flybaby?

18:15.002 --> 18:16.492
It was just a joke, man.

18:16.837 --> 18:18.327
It's pretty funny.

18:19.873 --> 18:21.101
You could've killed me.

18:21.875 --> 18:22.705
What?

18:22.909 --> 18:24.308
I said you could've killed me.

18:26.179 --> 18:27.407
Couldn't hear you.

18:32.386 --> 18:33.910
Can you hear me now?

18:41.461 --> 18:43.622
Doug, you've got to
come with me now.

18:43.830 --> 18:46.731
It's your dad.
You got to get back to the base.

18:48.068 --> 18:49.729
He's been shot down.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.870
Jesus.

18:54.074 --> 18:56.065
They just found out about it.
Come on.

18:56.410 --> 18:58.901
- We got to get Matt.
- I'll get Matt. You go.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.357
When will they release him?

19:18.432 --> 19:19.490
They don't know.

19:20.267 --> 19:23.896
Didn't they tell you why
he was flying so near the coast?

19:25.272 --> 19:26.933
The general said...

19:27.941 --> 19:29.499
...they couldn't tell me.

19:32.779 --> 19:34.303
I'll be back in a minute.

19:38.785 --> 19:40.446
Is Colonel Blackburn in there?

19:41.121 --> 19:42.486
You can't go in there!

19:51.198 --> 19:52.688
Who do you think you are?

19:52.899 --> 19:55.766
Lighten up. I just want
to talk to Colonel Blackburn.

20:01.007 --> 20:02.565
I suppose you want some answers.

20:03.143 --> 20:05.134
Nobody's telling us
what's going on.

20:06.079 --> 20:08.912
I figured since you and Dad
have been friends for so long...

20:09.116 --> 20:10.344
...you'd tell me the truth.

20:11.251 --> 20:12.513
What'd they tell you so far?

20:13.320 --> 20:17.484
Just that Dad was flying
over the Med when he got jumped.

20:17.691 --> 20:19.750
And then something crazy
about a trial.

20:20.026 --> 20:22.824
It's kind of
a complicated situation.

20:23.663 --> 20:25.358
Hell, it's a bunch of nonsense!

20:25.832 --> 20:28.198
Some countries play a little
different than we do.

20:28.401 --> 20:31.666
Come on. Stick on
my heels for a minute.

20:38.845 --> 20:40.312
I'll get in trouble...

20:40.514 --> 20:44.075
...for showing you this,
so keep your mouth shut.

20:44.284 --> 20:47.583
We fly navigation
exercises to establish...

20:47.788 --> 20:50.382
International airspace.
My dad told me that.

20:50.557 --> 20:53.321
He wasn't in their territory.
Why'd they fire on him?

20:53.527 --> 20:54.687
They claim 200 miles...

20:54.895 --> 20:56.328
...about out to here.

20:56.563 --> 20:58.394
We only recognize 12.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.730
They usually don't mess with us,
but this time...

21:01.935 --> 21:03.493
...they caught us with our pants down.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.034
Your dad didn't have a chance.

21:06.339 --> 21:08.466
But he waxed 3 of them before he bailed.

21:08.875 --> 21:10.536
What's this about a trial?

21:13.280 --> 21:16.147
They're full of shit!
We asked for a carrier!

21:16.383 --> 21:18.783
They said they couldn't cooperate.

21:19.219 --> 21:20.117
It's nonsense!

21:20.720 --> 21:23.086
Get Admiral what's-his-nuts
on the horn.

21:23.290 --> 21:25.349
Tell him the general
wants to talk to him.

21:31.965 --> 21:33.455
I'm sorry, Doug.

21:34.134 --> 21:35.158
I'll tell you one thing:

21:35.368 --> 21:37.495
I don't like the way the State
Department's playing this.

21:37.704 --> 21:41.800
We're holding the aces, and they act
like we only got a pair of twos.

21:42.008 --> 21:43.635
We thought a carrier
off their coast...

21:43.977 --> 21:45.137
...might put a fire up their butt.

21:45.378 --> 21:47.437
They denied our request.

21:47.781 --> 21:50.113
They say they're negotiating.

21:50.483 --> 21:53.008
Will you please tell me what's going on?

21:56.156 --> 21:59.319
He's being tried for violating
their territory.

21:59.659 --> 22:01.650
We know it's bullshit.

22:02.162 --> 22:04.392
Washington knows it's bullshit.

22:04.598 --> 22:06.395
The State Department
thinks it's a bluff.

22:07.334 --> 22:10.462
They think they're
using him as a bargaining chip.

22:10.670 --> 22:11.796
For what?

22:12.172 --> 22:15.005
They're what's called a "pariah nation."

22:15.342 --> 22:19.676
They're probably using this to get us to
lift our trade embargo.

22:21.681 --> 22:23.171
What's going to happen?

22:23.516 --> 22:25.381
I don't know yet.

22:26.853 --> 22:29.185
We hope to hear
what they want tomorrow.

22:29.522 --> 22:32.184
Till then, there's not much
any of us can do...

22:32.859 --> 22:36.056
...since the suits in the White House
have tied our hands.

22:36.363 --> 22:38.024
You'll have to be patient.

22:39.032 --> 22:41.694
We don't even have diplomatic
relations with them.

22:42.035 --> 22:45.198
So it takes a heap of time
just to make a phone call.

22:48.208 --> 22:50.199
I got the admiral on the horn.

22:51.378 --> 22:53.107
Hang in there, son.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.247
Yes, sir.

22:59.886 --> 23:02.377
Yeah, it came a minute ago.

23:02.722 --> 23:06.590
I think the general will
want to pursue this further.

23:07.394 --> 23:09.726
I don't know how
you can stay so calm.

23:10.063 --> 23:12.224
Because I've been through it before.

23:12.732 --> 23:13.994
You don't remember.

23:14.401 --> 23:16.062
You were only four years old.

23:16.403 --> 23:19.236
That time your dad
had to bail out over the Pacific.

23:19.572 --> 23:22.564
The whole time he was missing,
I didn't know if he was alive.

23:23.076 --> 23:25.738
I got to call Katie and tell her
I'm not going tonight.

23:26.079 --> 23:29.173
And tell the Winslows
not to come for graduation.

23:29.416 --> 23:31.907
Doug, that is not going to help him.

23:32.185 --> 23:34.915
He's stuck over there,
but he's thinking about us.

23:35.255 --> 23:37.917
He's thinking about you and Katie...

23:38.258 --> 23:40.158
...getting dressed up tonight.

23:41.594 --> 23:45.257
He's thinking about you
getting your diploma tomorrow.

23:46.266 --> 23:48.928
That's all he's got right now.
Somehow...

23:49.436 --> 23:50.926
...if you don't go...

23:52.105 --> 23:54.096
...it takes it all away from him.

24:00.947 --> 24:03.108
Look, I'm very scared.

24:04.284 --> 24:06.275
I'll admit that to you.

24:07.454 --> 24:10.116
But if you start thinking
the worst will happen...

24:11.124 --> 24:12.955
...somehow it always does.

24:20.900 --> 24:22.060
What'd you find out?

24:22.302 --> 24:25.465
I'll tell you in the car.
Let's go pick up Amy.

24:25.805 --> 24:27.830
Is Dad going to be all right?

24:28.308 --> 24:31.277
Yeah, Dad's going to be fine.
You go with Mom.

24:31.811 --> 24:33.642
I'll be home in a little while.

24:39.586 --> 24:41.076
What did Blackburn tell you?

24:41.421 --> 24:44.822
He said they think they're
holding him for ransom or something.

24:45.258 --> 24:48.659
Can you nose around your dad's office,
see what they want from him?

24:48.995 --> 24:52.158
I was just there. Everybody in
Intelligence is scrambling.

24:52.499 --> 24:55.195
They're keeping a lid on this.
Nobody's talking.

24:55.402 --> 24:56.391
Come on, Milo.

24:57.837 --> 25:01.000
All right.
I'll see what else I can find out.

25:01.241 --> 25:02.538
Thanks a lot.

25:05.845 --> 25:08.006
Is there anything we can do?

25:08.348 --> 25:09.679
No, nothing.

25:10.016 --> 25:11.984
Guess you won't feel like going tonight?

25:12.352 --> 25:13.819
I didn't at first, but...

25:14.020 --> 25:17.183
...it's better than sitting home
going crazy over this.

25:17.424 --> 25:18.448
Listen, Doug...

25:19.025 --> 25:22.859
...everything will work out.
They won't mess with us.

25:23.196 --> 25:25.596
The Air Force will kick ass if they do.

25:25.865 --> 25:27.196
Like in Iran.

25:27.634 --> 25:30.364
That was different.
Mr. Peanut was in charge then.

25:30.703 --> 25:35.037
Now we got a President who don't take
shit from gimpy countries.

25:35.375 --> 25:38.003
Why do you think they call him
Ronnie Ray Gun?

25:38.711 --> 25:39.575
I almost forgot.

25:39.879 --> 25:41.369
I got some boutonnieres.

25:44.050 --> 25:46.541
This smells so good.
Take a whiff.

25:47.387 --> 25:48.581
Go ahead.

26:11.578 --> 26:14.741
You are allowed
a statement on your behalf.

26:15.081 --> 26:17.072
This court is a fraud.

26:17.917 --> 26:21.114
At no time did I violate
your territorial airspace.

26:21.488 --> 26:25.254
At no time did we engage in any
intelligence-gathering operation.

26:25.758 --> 26:28.420
This trial is a blatant
violation of international law.

26:34.934 --> 26:38.426
The American naiveté
never ceases to amaze me.

26:39.772 --> 26:44.266
We make the laws in this country.
We are not subject to your...

26:44.511 --> 26:47.002
...ridiculous Western alliances.

26:47.447 --> 26:49.438
I am a pilot myself.

26:49.782 --> 26:52.774
And when in flight,
I am always aware...

26:53.119 --> 26:55.781
...of my exact position.

26:56.456 --> 27:01.120
I have no doubt
you were quite clear about yours.

27:01.661 --> 27:06.462
Your country has been warned
time and time again!

27:08.968 --> 27:11.869
Yet your leaders choose
to make light of our demands.

27:12.305 --> 27:14.136
Reparation is our due...

27:14.474 --> 27:16.339
...and we shall have our due.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.845
They didn't ask for anything?

28:04.190 --> 28:07.353
They didn't. I was right
outside my dad's office.

28:07.694 --> 28:09.184
None of them could believe it!

28:09.596 --> 28:13.191
They've held the trial
and found your dad guilty.

28:14.801 --> 28:15.825
What does that mean?

28:16.202 --> 28:20.730
Nobody knows. They haven't sentenced
him yet. It could mean prison, or...

28:21.140 --> 28:23.301
Why are they playing so tough?

28:24.210 --> 28:25.837
The State Department thinks...

28:26.045 --> 28:29.173
...they don't want other nations thinking
they're chicken of the U.S.

28:29.382 --> 28:30.872
They're trying to set an example.

28:31.150 --> 28:32.117
When are they going in?

28:33.219 --> 28:36.586
The Marines! They ain't going to sit
and take this crap!

28:37.490 --> 28:38.923
Nothing's being planned.

28:39.125 --> 28:41.719
But my dad thinks they'll
work something out.

28:42.061 --> 28:43.892
What are they going to work out?

28:44.731 --> 28:47.962
How many years is he going to
stay in that shithole?

28:49.102 --> 28:50.433
What are they doing about it?

28:50.903 --> 28:52.598
Dad says they're negotiating.

28:54.407 --> 28:56.841
They won't do shit and you know it!

29:11.090 --> 29:12.421
Doug's here.

29:13.593 --> 29:16.323
I'm sorry about not being able to
return your calls...

29:16.763 --> 29:19.789
...but since thing's heated up,
the general's had me hopping.

29:20.099 --> 29:22.260
Colonel, don't lie to me.

29:22.535 --> 29:24.400
Are you guys planning something?

29:24.604 --> 29:25.798
We're doing all we can.

29:26.773 --> 29:28.240
Which is nothing, isn't it?

29:28.441 --> 29:29.931
They're trying to talk to them.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.667
Trying to make them listen to reason.

29:31.878 --> 29:35.075
Other than that,
we got nothing on the boards.

29:35.448 --> 29:36.437
I'm sorry.

29:37.450 --> 29:39.111
Yeah, so am I.

30:13.653 --> 30:16.144
I heard what happened
to your dad, and I...

30:18.324 --> 30:21.657
Marty, I was wondering
if you could slip me in?

30:23.496 --> 30:24.360
Tell you what...

30:24.564 --> 30:26.794
There's someone due in now,
but he's running late.

30:26.999 --> 30:29.559
I'll load it up, and
you take it till he gets here.

30:32.672 --> 30:34.606
Just keep cool about this.

30:34.907 --> 30:37.501
It isn't the same as
sneaking you in at night.

30:50.022 --> 30:52.354
Okay, I'll set you up with some MiGs.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.759
Enemy squadron sighted.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.933
All right, you bastards.

31:09.709 --> 31:11.677
Climbing to flight level 2-7-0.

31:14.881 --> 31:17.008
Have radar. Locking on to engage.

31:27.860 --> 31:28.952
What else you got, Marty?

31:33.199 --> 31:34.029
This is Bluebird.

31:34.500 --> 31:36.798
<i>Enemy approachlng</i>
<i>at fllght level 2-2-0.</i>

31:37.003 --> 31:38.027
- <i>Conflrm.</i>
- Roger.

31:43.042 --> 31:44.373
Shit!

31:53.019 --> 31:54.680
<i>Excellent move.</i>

32:01.494 --> 32:02.791
That's four.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.024
I don't believe it.

32:11.671 --> 32:14.265
<i>The dlve's too extreme! Pull It up!</i>

32:14.607 --> 32:16.131
<i>Check your radar!</i>

32:44.136 --> 32:46.969
Marty, I don't believe
those guys could've...

32:48.140 --> 32:49.835
Fancy maneuvering's no good...

32:50.042 --> 32:52.977
...if you don't watch
the guys flying behind you.

32:53.479 --> 32:55.947
I didn't see them. I couldn't.

32:56.315 --> 32:58.283
Watch the HUD! That's what it's for.

32:58.918 --> 33:00.385
Try cutting out that music.

33:00.987 --> 33:03.319
Sorry, Colonel.
We used up all your time.

33:03.556 --> 33:06.024
- Catch you next week.
- You got it.

33:08.661 --> 33:10.253
You keep your chin up, buddy.

33:10.463 --> 33:11.862
Thanks a lot.

33:13.599 --> 33:15.692
Something you want to ask me?

33:15.902 --> 33:18.336
I didn't know you were still
in the Air Force.

33:18.538 --> 33:19.630
I'm not.

33:19.872 --> 33:21.362
Are you in the reserves?

33:22.708 --> 33:24.869
How come you're working
as a mechanic?

33:25.945 --> 33:28.573
Because fixing airplanes
is something I like to do.

33:29.248 --> 33:31.045
Anything else you want to ask?

33:31.884 --> 33:35.547
I wasn't trying to write a book.
I was just curious.

33:35.888 --> 33:39.324
Your dad's a strong man.
He'll be okay.

33:41.193 --> 33:42.524
You know him?

33:42.728 --> 33:45.720
No, but let's say I know the type.
That's what's important.

33:45.932 --> 33:49.891
If more people were like him,
he wouldn't be stuck there.

33:51.537 --> 33:53.027
What do you mean mean by that?

33:53.239 --> 33:55.230
Nobody's doing anything.

33:55.441 --> 33:59.571
They don't have the balls
to make those bastards release him.

33:59.779 --> 34:01.144
I see.

34:01.414 --> 34:02.642
What do you think we should do?

34:02.848 --> 34:04.782
Launch some missiles,
go to war over it?

34:05.084 --> 34:06.016
Of course not.

34:08.521 --> 34:10.420
But how tough is it? They're
a shitty little country.

34:10.623 --> 34:12.022
It's not the matter of being tough.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.748
It's the way they do things.

34:13.960 --> 34:15.552
Too many people making decisions.

34:15.761 --> 34:17.991
I've seen them operate.
They take too long.

34:18.197 --> 34:19.755
You've seen them plan one of these?

34:19.966 --> 34:21.159
A bunch of times.

34:21.367 --> 34:24.563
But they usually lose
more lives than they save.

34:24.770 --> 34:27.933
Your dad is a lot better off,
probably, if they negotiate.

34:28.274 --> 34:31.266
With the right plan, would it
be simple to go and get him?

34:31.476 --> 34:33.411
Not simple, but it's possible.

34:33.612 --> 34:35.205
Could you plan it?

34:35.715 --> 34:36.739
Why?

34:37.449 --> 34:38.280
I want to know.

34:39.685 --> 34:41.118
Probably.

34:41.687 --> 34:43.052
What do you think it would take?

34:43.289 --> 34:44.813
A hell of a lot more than you got, kid.

34:45.257 --> 34:46.087
Wait a minute.

34:46.292 --> 34:48.556
Dad's got a lot of people
on the base that love him.

34:49.962 --> 34:52.089
Being friends with someone's
a lot different...

34:52.297 --> 34:53.629
...than risking your life for them.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.470
Let me ask you this.

35:02.475 --> 35:06.002
Do you think an F-16, fully armed
with all its firepower...

35:06.212 --> 35:07.770
...could fly in there and pull it off?

35:07.980 --> 35:12.474
Stop wasting your time!
The Air Force won't do anything!

35:12.818 --> 35:15.286
They'll do a hell of a lot more
than you think.

35:15.488 --> 35:17.012
They just won't know they're doing it.

35:18.157 --> 35:20.819
I'm telling you, I bet you
can get a plane...

35:21.160 --> 35:24.459
...all the firepower it can carry,
aerial recon, intelligence.

35:24.764 --> 35:26.595
I got the whole goddamn base wired.

35:27.166 --> 35:29.828
Anything you need... I can get you.

35:30.036 --> 35:31.867
You wired enough to get me pilots?

35:34.006 --> 35:35.132
I can get you one.

35:38.010 --> 35:41.468
I know this is the toughest thing
you've ever been through.

35:42.682 --> 35:45.480
But hanging onto these crazy ideas...

35:45.685 --> 35:47.209
...isn't going to make it any easier.

35:47.820 --> 35:49.344
Take it easy.

35:49.955 --> 35:51.445
You don't think I can fly?

35:51.691 --> 35:52.953
Don't talk stupid.

35:53.192 --> 35:57.185
You think flying an F-16 in combat
is the same as flying the Snake?

35:57.396 --> 35:59.193
- Would you listen?
- I'm listening.

35:59.532 --> 36:02.365
I've got three times as many
hours on that simulator...

36:02.568 --> 36:05.036
...as most pilots flying Falcons
on the base.

36:05.237 --> 36:07.865
As for combat,
you know that's bullshit.

36:08.207 --> 36:12.541
How many guys here have been in
dogfights? Four, five tops?

36:12.878 --> 36:17.042
The simulator trains them, and they
defend the whole country.

36:17.383 --> 36:18.714
You think because they're...

36:18.918 --> 36:21.478
...3 or 4 years older
it makes any difference?

36:21.721 --> 36:26.055
I've missed my simulator time. I won't
miss my flight time. I got to go.

36:26.392 --> 36:27.859
Let me go with you.

36:28.060 --> 36:30.051
I've been up a a bunch of times
with Dad.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.190
At least let me show you what I can do.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.559
I'm tired of talking about it.
I'm going.

36:35.601 --> 36:37.432
You know he ain't got a chance!

36:37.636 --> 36:39.900
But you don't give a shit enough
to help him!

36:40.539 --> 36:42.905
You're no different than anyone else!

36:48.147 --> 36:49.910
You really believe that nonsense
you're saying?

36:51.083 --> 36:52.516
Look at me when I talk to you!

36:59.091 --> 37:01.924
Let me clue you in on something
right now.

37:02.428 --> 37:06.421
I've given this country 22 damn fucking
years of my life!

37:06.632 --> 37:08.259
22 years!

37:08.601 --> 37:11.434
I've seen young boys blown out of
the air over the Pacific!

37:11.637 --> 37:13.434
I've seen their guts spread all over.

37:13.773 --> 37:18.107
So every time somebody dies for this
country, I give a shit!

37:19.779 --> 37:22.873
Nobody talks to me like this!
I'm not going to start now!

37:23.382 --> 37:24.906
You want to help your father?

37:25.451 --> 37:28.784
Be strong for your family.
Stay right here!

37:59.618 --> 38:00.744
I'm pleased to present...

38:00.953 --> 38:05.151
...this year's valedictorian,
Edward Thatcher.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.962
Students, faculty and parents:

38:14.166 --> 38:17.829
Each year, we as students
have the luxury of our dreams...

38:18.037 --> 38:20.164
...without the responsibilities
of our sustenance.

38:20.372 --> 38:24.103
Therefore, our gratitude must be to
those who give us that freedom...

38:24.343 --> 38:28.439
...so that we can grow. To our parents,
I dedicate this ceremony.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.778
What were those loops and rolls,
Colonel?

39:01.146 --> 39:03.740
I thought we were supposed to keep
strict formation during training.

39:03.983 --> 39:06.076
I had a malfunction
in my throttle sensor, Major.

39:06.285 --> 39:08.412
I was trying to sort out the problem.

39:08.621 --> 39:11.283
I thought you were going
to do some skywriting.

39:11.624 --> 39:14.593
I may have a problem with my receiver.

39:14.793 --> 39:16.454
I heard music up there.

39:16.795 --> 39:20.788
I must have picked up
a radio station or something.

39:21.634 --> 39:23.295
I'll have it checked out.

39:31.810 --> 39:35.644
These are training maneuvers,
not auditions for the Thunderbirds!

39:35.981 --> 39:38.074
It's not a rock concert.

39:38.484 --> 39:39.473
Get over there!

39:39.818 --> 39:41.979
What the hell were you thinking?

39:42.321 --> 39:46.655
Do you know what could happen if
you got caught in that plane?

39:46.992 --> 39:48.983
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

39:49.328 --> 39:53.025
You bet it won't. That's the last
time you go up with me.

39:53.265 --> 39:56.257
- Come on, Dad.
- I don't want to hear it!

39:58.570 --> 40:01.630
You're graduating. When will you show
some responsibility?

40:02.174 --> 40:05.302
When I'm gone, I'd like to
have a little confidence...

40:05.511 --> 40:07.035
...that I know you can handle things.

40:08.681 --> 40:11.172
At some point you've got to grow up.

40:12.284 --> 40:13.512
Is that an order, sir?

40:13.786 --> 40:15.686
Yeah, that's an order.

40:18.123 --> 40:19.249
Understood, sir.

40:19.458 --> 40:22.188
May I ask the colonel a question?

40:23.929 --> 40:25.260
Go ahead.

40:26.865 --> 40:30.858
Did he like the reverse spirals I
executed at 22,000 feet?

40:31.203 --> 40:33.831
They've been rehearsed all week
in the simulator.

40:35.808 --> 40:36.638
I did.

40:38.377 --> 40:41.369
Get out of here. The colonel's
wife thinks you're at school.

40:42.014 --> 40:42.981
Yes, sir.

40:44.049 --> 40:46.108
<i>Today Is an lmportant day</i>
<i>for all of us.</i>

40:46.485 --> 40:47.611
A turning point.

40:48.020 --> 40:50.853
A time to realize it's time
to stop being children.

40:51.090 --> 40:54.082
A time to take charge
of our lives and destinies.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.260
This is the time
to believe in ourselves...

40:56.462 --> 40:58.930
...or leave our dreams behind.
Thank you.

41:17.616 --> 41:19.277
What's the matter?

41:20.119 --> 41:24.351
I didn't want to tell you before.
They heard from Washington.

41:24.556 --> 41:26.717
Your dad's been sentenced.

41:27.593 --> 41:28.685
Three days.

41:28.894 --> 41:30.122
Three days?

41:30.462 --> 41:32.430
What do you mean, three days?

41:33.632 --> 41:35.293
They're going to hang him.

41:36.101 --> 41:38.968
In three days,
they're going to hang him.

41:57.656 --> 42:00.124
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?

42:00.325 --> 42:01.656
About Dad.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.653
I think we can help him.

42:03.862 --> 42:04.556
How?

42:05.898 --> 42:07.832
I think I know a way...

42:08.500 --> 42:09.990
...to go in and get him out.

42:12.504 --> 42:14.938
God. When are we going?

42:16.842 --> 42:19.106
Come on, I need you to do
something for me.

42:20.846 --> 42:22.313
What do you want me to do?

42:22.514 --> 42:23.708
Call all the Eagles.

42:23.916 --> 42:27.249
Tell them to meet me at the
clubhouse tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.

42:27.453 --> 42:29.512
I got a bunch of things to work out.

42:31.190 --> 42:33.181
Come on, go on.
You going to call?

42:34.860 --> 42:37.021
Are they really going to kill him?

42:37.362 --> 42:39.227
I'm not waiting around to find out.

42:39.431 --> 42:40.728
Now go on.

42:58.817 --> 42:59.875
Welcome, Minister.

43:00.219 --> 43:02.380
We will take you to the prison at once.

43:32.417 --> 43:36.080
I've been informed you will not
sign the confession we require.

43:36.421 --> 43:38.412
I came to ask you to reconsider.

43:38.624 --> 43:39.716
You see?

43:40.125 --> 43:42.889
I am a compassionate man.

43:43.262 --> 43:46.595
I understand your courage
and your sense of duty.

43:46.899 --> 43:49.766
But there are those
in power above me...

43:50.335 --> 43:53.202
...who do not share my sentiments.

43:55.073 --> 43:57.837
If you mean your beloved leader,
have him come here...

43:58.043 --> 44:00.068
...and see me personally.

44:00.279 --> 44:01.769
I'll give him a confession.

44:01.980 --> 44:03.470
I'll shove it up his ass!

44:16.128 --> 44:18.619
First, I want to thank you
for coming so early.

44:18.830 --> 44:21.094
You know what's happened
to my father.

44:21.300 --> 44:23.029
I know you'd do anything for him.

44:23.302 --> 44:25.293
We've been together
for a long time.

44:25.771 --> 44:28.262
And together, we've gotten
everything we needed...

44:28.473 --> 44:30.065
...for our classes and airshows.

44:30.309 --> 44:33.472
Now I need you to come up with
some stuff to help my dad.

44:33.712 --> 44:36.977
If we don't come up with it,
he hasn't got much of a chance.

44:38.250 --> 44:39.239
I got a list here...

44:39.451 --> 44:41.146
...of everything we need to get.

44:41.353 --> 44:43.253
Starting off with...

44:43.689 --> 44:47.318
Dad, I'll take these to Hazel myself.
I wanted to say hi anyway.

44:53.932 --> 44:55.126
<i>Entrez.</i>

44:55.334 --> 44:57.393
I got some more updates
from my dad for you.

44:57.603 --> 45:00.071
Thanks, Milo. Great.

45:01.340 --> 45:03.706
Oh, my God!
Look how many of them there are.

45:07.412 --> 45:09.403
Getting pretty heavy-duty
around here.

45:09.615 --> 45:11.310
I know.

45:11.617 --> 45:12.379
Stop!

45:12.551 --> 45:14.519
I thought you had this thing fixed.

45:14.920 --> 45:15.909
I did!

45:16.121 --> 45:18.453
Go input on the mainframe.
I'll call someone.

45:20.025 --> 45:21.720
Yeah, then we won't get behind.

45:21.927 --> 45:26.023
It's urgent that we get this out
and not lose time.

45:26.365 --> 45:27.457
You'll get him then?

45:27.666 --> 45:28.758
Sure.
I promise.

45:28.967 --> 45:30.229
Great.

45:30.836 --> 45:32.303
Now, I'll work on these.

45:32.504 --> 45:34.904
You are an angel, Milo.

45:35.107 --> 45:36.699
This is wonderful.

45:36.908 --> 45:40.639
I'll be at the mainframe.
I should be back in an hour.

46:15.414 --> 46:17.006
What are you guys doing here?

46:17.215 --> 46:20.412
I just brought my friend down
to see those new Packer 32s.

46:20.686 --> 46:23.484
You know I can't sneak you guys
in here during the daytime.

46:24.089 --> 46:25.784
Come on, Sweeney.

46:26.291 --> 46:28.919
My sister said to ask you
to do it for her.

46:30.295 --> 46:32.286
Was she really talking about me?

46:32.531 --> 46:33.793
I heard her tell Mom...

46:33.999 --> 46:36.832
...she's pretty upset that
you don't call her more often.

46:37.936 --> 46:40.336
I can sneak you in
for 5 minutes...

46:40.539 --> 46:42.871
...until Dover gets back.
But only one of you.

46:44.876 --> 46:45.706
Go ahead.

46:46.011 --> 46:47.308
I've seen them.

47:04.796 --> 47:05.728
Hi, Dad!

47:06.131 --> 47:07.325
What are you guys up to?

47:07.532 --> 47:10.626
We came to get that picture
you promised us for our room.

47:10.836 --> 47:12.531
Remember, the satellite photo
of the earth...

47:12.738 --> 47:14.399
...with the weather on it,
and stuff?

47:14.639 --> 47:17.631
That was months ago.
What made you come for that now?

47:17.843 --> 47:21.244
You forgot to bring it home
the last 4 times we asked you.

47:21.480 --> 47:23.607
I guess you're right.
I'll go get it.

47:23.815 --> 47:24.782
We can get it!

47:24.983 --> 47:26.245
Don't be silly, I got time.

47:28.920 --> 47:30.410
I didn't mean to.

47:30.756 --> 47:33.247
I got to go to the latrine
and wash this out.

47:33.458 --> 47:35.153
Go in the back, get the picture.

47:35.360 --> 47:36.452
Put it in this sleeve.

47:36.661 --> 47:39.528
I'll leave you a clearance
with Connie to get it out.

47:39.731 --> 47:40.891
Thanks.

47:48.440 --> 47:50.340
I'm glad you brought these down.

47:50.542 --> 47:52.510
Mom's starving me on this new diet.

48:07.492 --> 48:08.254
Shit!

48:13.098 --> 48:15.623
- What do we got?
- Delta 6-6-2.

48:17.135 --> 48:19.899
Get the Falcon maintenance file.

48:20.872 --> 48:22.499
F-16s BR4.

48:26.912 --> 48:28.038
Bingo! We're in!

48:47.466 --> 48:48.364
Who is it?

48:48.567 --> 48:50.000
It's Doug Masters.

48:53.405 --> 48:55.373
I know what you said before.

48:55.574 --> 48:58.168
And I'm sorry about what I said.

48:58.577 --> 49:01.273
But I came to ask you one last time
if you'd help me.

49:06.251 --> 49:09.186
I got the aerial recon of everything
those bastards got over there.

49:09.387 --> 49:11.947
Coastal defenses, surface-to-air
missile emplacements...

49:12.157 --> 49:13.419
...and troop locations.

49:13.959 --> 49:17.759
I know where their fighter base is,
and their fighter capacity.

49:17.963 --> 49:21.763
I know where they're holding my dad.
Got a picture of the building.

49:24.603 --> 49:25.900
I got intelligence.

49:26.104 --> 49:29.369
Tons of it. I know every move
they make and when they make it.

49:29.574 --> 49:30.802
When they fly maneuvers.

49:31.009 --> 49:33.136
Every move in and out
of their airports.

49:33.345 --> 49:36.678
If you need to know, I can tell you
when somebody goes to the can.

49:37.649 --> 49:41.176
I can get you an F-16
with anything you want on it.

49:41.786 --> 49:44.448
Sidewinders, Mk 82 Snake Eyes...

49:44.723 --> 49:48.056
...cluster bombs, Durandels,
Paveway smart bombs...

49:48.326 --> 49:51.295
...and all the 30mm rounds
the GE-Pod can carry.

49:51.997 --> 49:53.862
Jesus, he's only got...

49:54.065 --> 49:55.999
Three days! Three days.

49:56.201 --> 49:58.465
And if you keep on talking
you'll waste one.

50:00.005 --> 50:01.165
Bring that stuff.

50:18.089 --> 50:19.647
When did you work this up?

50:19.925 --> 50:21.085
Last night.

50:21.293 --> 50:23.761
When I heard about
that trial.

50:24.362 --> 50:26.489
You think you can
figure something out?

50:27.465 --> 50:28.898
Come up with a plan?

50:29.734 --> 50:32.703
I'm a long way from
answering that question, son.

50:33.071 --> 50:35.301
But I sure would like to try.

50:35.507 --> 50:38.374
Something about maniacs
messing with good men...

50:38.577 --> 50:40.545
...that always pisses me off.

50:40.946 --> 50:42.504
I'll need to find a place...

50:42.714 --> 50:44.272
...for aerial recon, fighter bases...

50:44.482 --> 50:46.245
...the place where they're
keeping him...

50:46.451 --> 50:47.782
...scheduling info...

50:47.986 --> 50:51.217
And you read me the intelligence
when I ask you, okay?

51:00.398 --> 51:02.491
How can you think
with that music on?

51:03.201 --> 51:05.101
Come on, let's see what you got.

51:05.303 --> 51:08.431
Let's see what you got.
Quick. Too much time.

52:15.774 --> 52:17.036
What's wrong?

52:17.776 --> 52:19.437
Got your tennis shoes on?

52:19.744 --> 52:21.041
Yeah, why?

52:21.446 --> 52:24.609
Bring all the intelligence readouts
and follow me.

52:25.617 --> 52:28.450
Get any of that
coastal defense info yet?

52:30.455 --> 52:32.116
Two trawlers...

52:32.791 --> 52:34.656
...50mm guns.

52:34.959 --> 52:37.257
But they're currently in the Gulf.

52:40.565 --> 52:43.056
This would be easier
if I had on my shorts on.

52:43.268 --> 52:47.102
How many times have I told you,
don't interrupt me when I'm thinking!

52:47.639 --> 52:49.800
Read me that fighter status again.

52:50.308 --> 52:51.332
Find it?

52:52.477 --> 52:54.411
There's only 5 choppers
stationed there.

52:54.612 --> 52:56.273
Get me the anti-aircraft locations.

52:56.481 --> 52:58.642
- Which ones?
- All of them.

52:59.150 --> 53:02.244
That'll take some time.
They're listed all over the place.

53:03.321 --> 53:04.151
Like Italian?

53:08.293 --> 53:09.521
You can eat
while you read.

53:27.846 --> 53:31.179
Slappy, I'd like for you
to meet Doug here.

53:31.416 --> 53:32.940
This is Slappy,
the owner of the place.

53:33.151 --> 53:35.676
He's the one you have to sue
for food poisoning.

53:36.688 --> 53:40.146
Good to see you come around
and contribute to my retirement.

53:40.358 --> 53:43.020
Even bring some white folk in here.
I like that.

53:43.361 --> 53:45.022
You better leave me alone.

53:45.697 --> 53:48.359
We've got some high-level conference
talking to do.

53:48.633 --> 53:50.658
- Excuse me!
- Excuse you.

53:53.404 --> 53:54.530
Find it?

53:54.739 --> 53:55.797
Right here.

53:59.310 --> 54:00.470
Let's see.

54:01.880 --> 54:03.541
Move it like this...

54:08.219 --> 54:12.212
The plane comes through here,
knocks out this pepperoni here.

54:12.490 --> 54:14.549
You got to be careful of this olive.

54:15.226 --> 54:17.217
This cheese here will nail your butt.

54:18.563 --> 54:21.726
Through this lettuce,
tight around this carrot...

54:22.066 --> 54:23.829
...a second plane will sneak in.

54:24.068 --> 54:26.901
What do you mean?
Who's flying a second plane?

54:27.405 --> 54:29.930
Who do you think?
I'm taking out these pepperonis.

54:30.408 --> 54:31.670
I don't believe it!

54:32.744 --> 54:34.075
Why?
Are you prejudiced?

54:34.512 --> 54:37.413
Don't play with me.
Why are you flying?

54:37.749 --> 54:42.083
Let's just say that when I met your dad,
he earned my respect.

54:42.287 --> 54:44.118
I do a lot for people I respect.

54:46.491 --> 54:49.756
- When did you first meet him?
- About two years ago.

54:52.430 --> 54:54.796
I'd booked some simulator module time.

54:54.999 --> 54:59.095
I was late. I still had on coveralls,
my hands all covered with grease.

54:59.304 --> 55:01.670
I even forgot my ID card.
Wouldn't you know...

55:01.873 --> 55:03.932
...the guy on the module was new.

55:04.275 --> 55:07.802
He said, "Get your black butt
out of here before I call security."

55:08.012 --> 55:11.106
A couple of hotshot pilots
thought it was real funny.

55:12.617 --> 55:14.608
Didn't you want to kick their ass?

55:14.953 --> 55:16.614
As a matter of fact, I did.

55:18.056 --> 55:21.685
But at that time, your dad
walks out of the simulator module.

55:21.960 --> 55:23.325
I'd never seen him before.

55:23.528 --> 55:26.759
He asked what was happening.
When they told him the story...

55:26.965 --> 55:30.298
...he walks over to me and looks
at me for a fast second.

55:30.635 --> 55:33.126
Steps back and snaps me a salute.

55:33.338 --> 55:36.830
Says, "Sorry, sir, we'll get things
set up right away, Colonel."

55:38.810 --> 55:43.144
Your dad understands a lot
about people's dignity.

55:43.481 --> 55:47.713
That's the last kind of person
I want to see locked in some cage.

55:48.152 --> 55:52.145
He won't be. We'll bust him out
of there like a bat out of hell.

55:52.490 --> 55:54.822
All we have got so far is a plan.

55:55.660 --> 55:59.687
All you've proven to me is you can
steal computer printouts and pictures.

56:00.164 --> 56:04.726
After tomorrow, he's only got one day
left. Are we going for it or not?

56:05.169 --> 56:07.535
We are going when I say we are going.

56:08.172 --> 56:10.402
You still got
a lot left to prove to me.

56:10.675 --> 56:13.508
Keep your mouth shut,
and listen to what I have to ask you.

56:13.845 --> 56:17.212
I want to test you,
make sure that you can deliver...

56:17.448 --> 56:19.780
...what you say you can deliver.

56:20.018 --> 56:21.110
Name it.

56:26.357 --> 56:28.518
I want a couple of F-16s...

56:28.726 --> 56:31.194
...with full, approved flight plans.

56:31.863 --> 56:35.697
Along with the stuff I give you
are the 2 phony names I'll let you have.

56:36.034 --> 56:40.596
And I want a trainer at the same time,
on the tarmac tomorrow.

56:41.539 --> 56:43.632
I'll let you put your money
where your mouth is.

56:44.976 --> 56:47.001
You still don't believe I can fly,
do you?

56:47.211 --> 56:48.769
Maybe and maybe not.

56:49.213 --> 56:52.046
I want to test you out
on some live targets.

56:52.884 --> 56:54.943
Great.
You won't be disappointed.

56:55.553 --> 56:56.815
I hope not.

56:57.488 --> 57:00.821
Or else we ain't going nowhere, boy.
Understand?

57:09.901 --> 57:10.799
Enough!

57:14.739 --> 57:17.105
You are a very stubborn man, Colonel.

57:17.575 --> 57:20.066
It would be easier
if you'd accommodate us...

57:20.278 --> 57:21.905
...with a signed admission of guilt...

57:22.246 --> 57:24.339
...but we can proceed without it.

57:24.916 --> 57:29.080
I must say,
I admire the way you can handle pain.

57:29.420 --> 57:32.514
I'm looking forward to seeing you
handle death.

57:47.638 --> 57:49.765
Good thing Milo's on our side.

57:54.445 --> 57:56.106
My name's Colonel Sinclair.

57:56.614 --> 57:59.208
I believe you have me down
for that trainer.

58:03.788 --> 58:04.948
Your name's not listed.

58:05.156 --> 58:08.614
- Let me check this with flight control.
- That's not necessary.

58:18.970 --> 58:21.131
Just got orders
to take these two in.

58:23.474 --> 58:27.604
Sorry about the screwup, sir.
Yours came in on the special last night.

58:27.812 --> 58:30.440
- She's ready to go.
- What's this about taking us in?

58:30.648 --> 58:32.980
Not you, sir.
I mean these two Falcons.

58:33.317 --> 58:35.649
They were all set up to go to Spain.

58:35.920 --> 58:37.751
Crew worked all night to load them.

58:37.955 --> 58:40.480
Computer just canceled it.
A pain in the ass.

58:41.893 --> 58:43.622
- She's ready to go.
- Thank you.

58:50.835 --> 58:53.668
Get off the ground quick,
before this gets canceled.

58:54.005 --> 58:56.667
Computer's been acting
kind of strange today.

59:21.699 --> 59:24.293
<i>You're cleared for takeoff.</i>
<i>Runaway 3-0.</i>

59:25.036 --> 59:28.028
Think you can get us over to runway 3-0?

59:28.372 --> 59:32.536
If you come up here and show me
where the throttle is in these things.

59:32.877 --> 59:34.572
I'm starting not to like you.

59:39.550 --> 59:41.950
This is Falcon 6 ready for takeoff.

59:42.386 --> 59:43.751
<i>Okay for takeoff.</i>

59:57.068 --> 59:59.229
Where do you want to go?

59:59.570 --> 01:00:00.696
You're driving.

01:00:01.372 --> 01:00:02.498
Let's see
what you got.

01:00:02.907 --> 01:00:03.965
Sure you're up to it?

01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:07.834
<i>You're not one of those hot dogs,</i>
<i>are you?</i>

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:16.684
How's that?

01:00:16.888 --> 01:00:19.083
Thought you was a pilot,
not an astronaut.

01:00:19.357 --> 01:00:20.517
I guess you're right.

01:00:27.632 --> 01:00:28.530
By the way...

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.461
...I forgot to ask
when you ate last.

01:00:31.669 --> 01:00:33.603
You'd know
if I had a big breakfast.

01:00:34.105 --> 01:00:35.003
Want to see me...

01:00:35.206 --> 01:00:36.264
...turn?

01:00:43.981 --> 01:00:46.176
Now I'm really
starting not to like you.

01:00:47.952 --> 01:00:49.146
Head over to the range.

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:50.648
Yes, sir, Colonel, sir.

01:00:52.456 --> 01:00:55.948
<i>Comlng up to lt.</i>
<i>I want you to clrcle around low.</i>

01:00:56.294 --> 01:00:59.957
<i>Go north. Take out those</i>
<i>two vertlcal targets up ahead.</i>

01:01:00.464 --> 01:01:01.362
Remember!

01:01:01.899 --> 01:01:03.332
The simulator's different.

01:01:03.801 --> 01:01:05.826
Just got to feel your way.

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:08.836
I want you to concentrate.

01:01:10.808 --> 01:01:12.173
Cut off that stuff!

01:01:12.577 --> 01:01:13.601
Lt'll ruin my rhythm.

01:01:13.811 --> 01:01:15.403
If you don't,
I'll ruin something else!

01:01:27.458 --> 01:01:28.322
Shit!

01:01:28.593 --> 01:01:29.582
I told you.

01:01:30.161 --> 01:01:31.025
This time...

01:01:31.262 --> 01:01:35.494
<i>... I want you to drop a Mark 82</i>
<i>to that horlzontal up ahead.</i>

01:01:42.506 --> 01:01:45.907
We can't go in there
with you shooting like this!

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:49.502
Turn this thing around.
Let's head back to base.

01:01:49.747 --> 01:01:51.237
Damn it,
I'll do it my way.

01:02:28.219 --> 01:02:29.379
Nice piece of work!

01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:34.551
Are we going for it?

01:02:34.859 --> 01:02:36.417
There's still some things...

01:02:42.566 --> 01:02:44.796
All right!
Sounds like we're going!

01:02:46.737 --> 01:02:49.467
Get your Eagles.
There's still details to work out.

01:02:49.807 --> 01:02:51.104
Yes, sir, Colonel, sir.

01:03:10.094 --> 01:03:13.586
I figure you can do
your first 500 miles at Mach.6...

01:03:13.931 --> 01:03:17.264
...and your last 180 at Mach.9
after your last refuel.

01:03:17.601 --> 01:03:20.764
- Did you account for wind current?
- I got the face winds.

01:03:22.606 --> 01:03:26.599
When we get back, we're going to
have to go into business together.

01:03:34.118 --> 01:03:38.452
In a dogfight, you must always
remember to keep the angle on them.

01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:43.123
Attack them either from
the side, the top or the back.

01:03:43.461 --> 01:03:45.952
If they come at you straight,
like this...

01:03:46.297 --> 01:03:49.630
You better eject,
and start doing some backstroking!

01:03:55.406 --> 01:03:58.967
Most important is to watch
your air speed as they talk you in.

01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:02.541
Be careful. Use a deep voice
or they'll know you're a kid.

01:04:03.013 --> 01:04:04.446
Let me hear you talk.

01:04:04.782 --> 01:04:05.771
This is Bluebird...

01:04:06.117 --> 01:04:09.951
No, it's got to be deeper. Put some
bass in your voice, like Slappy.

01:04:10.154 --> 01:04:10.813
Do it again.

01:04:13.924 --> 01:04:15.551
This is the Bluebird.

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.087
I be ready to refuel.

01:04:19.663 --> 01:04:24.498
Doug, move that control tower
about 10 degrees to the north.

01:04:25.336 --> 01:04:27.497
No, that's the oil refinery.

01:04:28.005 --> 01:04:30.838
That's the detention center
where he's being held.

01:04:32.209 --> 01:04:34.837
That's what's left of my lunch.
Get that out of there.

01:04:35.513 --> 01:04:39.506
You must be in love!
The control tower is over here.

01:04:47.792 --> 01:04:49.453
Cheese!

01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:01.701
All right, gentlemen
and ladies.

01:05:02.039 --> 01:05:06.635
Time for the final check for tomorrow's
operation. I hope you're ready.

01:05:12.883 --> 01:05:14.043
Status on the Falcons.

01:05:14.385 --> 01:05:17.877
Two F-16Bs standing by
on the northern runway as requsted.

01:05:18.722 --> 01:05:19.381
Fuel?

01:05:19.723 --> 01:05:22.658
Fully fueled.
Interior and exterior tanks.

01:05:22.993 --> 01:05:26.156
- Armaments?
- As requested and visually verified.

01:05:27.231 --> 01:05:28.425
Thank you.

01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:34.731
- Flight plans cleared?
- Both fully authorized.

01:05:35.739 --> 01:05:36.831
Refuel?

01:05:37.074 --> 01:05:40.339
I have a list of times and coordinates,
all verified.

01:05:40.744 --> 01:05:42.143
Place of detention?

01:05:42.746 --> 01:05:46.739
As of 1500 hours, Col. Masters
is still being held at the same location.

01:05:47.084 --> 01:05:49.245
No change in enemy plans reported.

01:05:52.389 --> 01:05:54.448
I congratulate you all
on some fine work.

01:05:54.658 --> 01:05:56.751
You've come a long way
in a short while.

01:05:57.094 --> 01:05:59.358
I don't judge people
by their experience...

01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:02.990
...but by their performance.
Yours has been exemplary.

01:06:05.035 --> 01:06:09.199
I'd like to shake your hands.
I've never had a finer planning staff.

01:06:14.445 --> 01:06:17.778
You go home to Mom and tell her
I'm out with Reggie and Tony.

01:06:18.115 --> 01:06:20.606
After tomorrow,
you're in charge.

01:06:21.452 --> 01:06:23.613
But only for a couple of days.

01:06:25.422 --> 01:06:26.889
It's a promise!

01:06:35.132 --> 01:06:37.032
Without you guys,
there's no way...

01:06:37.568 --> 01:06:38.626
We know that!

01:06:40.304 --> 01:06:41.498
Eagles.

01:06:55.819 --> 01:06:58.811
Show me the armaments availability list.

01:07:02.159 --> 01:07:05.492
I've come up with an idea that'll
give us some added insurance.

01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:07.922
I'm too loaded down...

01:07:08.832 --> 01:07:10.823
...so you have to carry it.

01:07:11.435 --> 01:07:12.424
Carry what?

01:07:14.772 --> 01:07:15.830
The Hades bomb.

01:07:18.609 --> 01:07:19.837
How fast can Milo work?

01:07:20.344 --> 01:07:23.677
He can rearm in 3 hours.
What do I do with the Hades?

01:07:24.181 --> 01:07:25.614
Before you land...

01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:29.414
...I want you to lay one in right here.

01:07:31.355 --> 01:07:34.017
It's got its good points
and its bad points.

01:07:35.192 --> 01:07:39.026
The good point is they won't be able
to see or touch you for 5 minutes.

01:07:39.363 --> 01:07:41.126
But you won't see them either.

01:07:42.199 --> 01:07:43.257
Now listen to me.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:44.694
Look!

01:07:45.536 --> 01:07:49.529
Once this fire goes out,
if you're not in the air...

01:07:49.873 --> 01:07:52.205
...you are a dead man.

01:08:00.217 --> 01:08:02.879
Now I want you to
get your butt in my trailer.

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:06.712
Get some sleep. I've got some
work to do and I need my privacy.

01:08:08.058 --> 01:08:11.721
I've got to see my Mom
and I have to call Katie.

01:08:11.996 --> 01:08:13.554
What are you going to tell them?

01:08:13.797 --> 01:08:15.856
- I don't know...
- I don't know either!

01:08:16.066 --> 01:08:18.057
You can't tell them the truth!

01:08:20.738 --> 01:08:24.299
I'll tell you what. I'll have
Slappy talk to both of them...

01:08:24.508 --> 01:08:26.066
...after we have gone.

01:08:26.577 --> 01:08:29.238
Okay?
Now you get in my trailer. Now.

01:08:33.082 --> 01:08:35.676
I said, get your butt in my
trailer...

01:08:35.919 --> 01:08:36.578
...now!

01:08:39.423 --> 01:08:40.549
Yes, sir.

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.348
<i>Yes, Mlnlster,</i>
<i>we are standlng by.</i>

01:09:06.216 --> 01:09:08.207
Give the American his final meal.

01:09:08.551 --> 01:09:12.420
After tomorrow, he will not have
much of an appetite.

01:09:27.171 --> 01:09:28.638
I told you to get some sleep.

01:09:29.073 --> 01:09:30.904
I'm just relaxing a bit.

01:09:31.575 --> 01:09:33.236
Watching a little TV.

01:09:33.743 --> 01:09:35.712
I don't need much sleep for this.

01:09:38.415 --> 01:09:40.406
How do you know
what you need for this?

01:09:41.085 --> 01:09:42.916
I just meant I'm ready.

01:09:43.921 --> 01:09:45.319
You're ready, aren't you?

01:09:46.924 --> 01:09:49.893
You think it's going to be so easy,
don't you?

01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:52.386
I don't think it will all be easy.

01:09:52.595 --> 01:09:53.926
I'm just ready for it.

01:09:54.264 --> 01:09:56.061
You ain't ready for shit, boy!

01:10:07.344 --> 01:10:08.368
Open it!

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:10.979
Go ahead, open it!

01:10:17.955 --> 01:10:18.853
Who are these guys?

01:10:19.289 --> 01:10:21.189
Kids that thought they
were ready too.

01:10:21.625 --> 01:10:23.593
- Pilots?
- All of them.

01:10:25.696 --> 01:10:27.220
They look about 22 or 23.

01:10:27.631 --> 01:10:28.757
That's right.

01:10:29.399 --> 01:10:31.833
I don't see why you're so worried.

01:10:32.069 --> 01:10:33.366
How are they
different from me?

01:10:33.637 --> 01:10:34.968
Because they're dead!

01:10:35.973 --> 01:10:37.304
All of them.

01:10:51.488 --> 01:10:53.479
I lay awake at night...

01:10:54.825 --> 01:10:58.158
...thinking about how fast
and how brutal they died.

01:10:58.996 --> 01:11:03.490
Parts of them falling on the land,
parts of them falling in the sea.

01:11:05.169 --> 01:11:08.502
Some parts of them burning
just into nothing in the air.

01:11:12.876 --> 01:11:13.774
All of them...

01:11:14.511 --> 01:11:16.342
...thought they were ready for it.

01:11:23.687 --> 01:11:24.949
When it was all over...

01:11:25.355 --> 01:11:28.688
...I promised myself I'd never
be part of killing kids again.

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.454
That's why it took so long
to come around to helping you.

01:11:36.033 --> 01:11:37.796
I've got us both trapped...

01:11:38.035 --> 01:11:40.526
...into something...
- That could kill us?

01:11:43.874 --> 01:11:45.705
I know that, Chappy.

01:11:46.543 --> 01:11:48.204
And those kids?

01:11:48.712 --> 01:11:51.875
I don't know what you think anymore,
but they knew it too.

01:11:54.051 --> 01:11:57.885
Maybe they weren't ready for it,
but who the hell is ever ready?

01:11:59.223 --> 01:12:02.556
You didn't get me into this.
I went to you, remember?

01:12:03.727 --> 01:12:05.388
I know what we're risking.

01:12:06.063 --> 01:12:08.554
And I'm proud
to be able to fly with you.

01:12:10.734 --> 01:12:12.895
Maybe I'm not all that ready...

01:12:13.403 --> 01:12:14.870
...but I'm damn proud.

01:12:18.242 --> 01:12:21.700
Enough of this nonsense.
Where's the tape recorder?

01:12:22.913 --> 01:12:24.312
In my bag, next to the sink.

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.240
Wait a minute.

01:12:28.685 --> 01:12:31.984
- Where do you think you're going?
- To see what you're doing.

01:12:32.189 --> 01:12:33.918
Go see what my pillow is doing.

01:12:34.124 --> 01:12:36.684
I want you asleep in five minutes.

01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:38.489
Wait a minute.

01:12:38.996 --> 01:12:40.088
I almost forgot.

01:12:45.869 --> 01:12:46.995
It's my first pair.

01:12:50.474 --> 01:12:53.807
- I'll bring them back.
- You better. Now get to bed.

01:12:55.479 --> 01:12:57.811
Yes, sir, Colonel, sir.

01:13:12.896 --> 01:13:15.694
<i>It sure Is strange</i>
<i>maklng you thls tape.</i>

01:13:15.899 --> 01:13:17.867
<i>I just got flnlshed</i>
<i>talklng to you.</i>

01:13:18.068 --> 01:13:19.763
<i>You had that look on your face.</i>

01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:22.905
<i>The look you had when you</i>
<i>asked me to help get your father.</i>

01:13:23.373 --> 01:13:25.841
<i>I never told you</i>
<i>how I felt about you.</i>

01:13:26.043 --> 01:13:29.012
<i>Always had a problem</i>
<i>talklng about my feellngs.</i>

01:13:29.346 --> 01:13:33.840
<i>I want to tell you, you've got</i>
<i>more courage than anybody I've ever met.</i>

01:13:34.184 --> 01:13:38.018
<i>You'll need every blt of It</i>
<i>to get through thls thlng.</i>

01:13:38.355 --> 01:13:42.451
<i>I want you to know, I'm proud</i>
<i>to have been by your slde.</i>

01:13:43.527 --> 01:13:47.327
<i>And whatever happens,</i>
<i>just remember you trled.</i>

01:13:47.698 --> 01:13:50.326
<i>And no one can</i>
<i>take that away from us.</i>

01:13:55.839 --> 01:13:57.238
<i>Okay for takeoff.</i>

01:14:11.054 --> 01:14:12.578
<i>Okay for takeoff.</i>

01:14:29.873 --> 01:14:31.431
Switch to frequency 8, over.

01:14:33.877 --> 01:14:35.572
I switched frequencies, over.

01:14:38.048 --> 01:14:40.414
That fancy flying
will eat up your fuel!

01:14:40.784 --> 01:14:43.844
I was getting used to the throttle.
It's a little touchy.

01:14:44.054 --> 01:14:47.785
Lucky I'm not in that cockpit with you.
I'd show you "touchy."

01:14:48.225 --> 01:14:51.558
<i>Use the other channels only to</i>
<i>communlcate wlth checkpolnts.</i>

01:14:51.895 --> 01:14:54.489
<i>They can monltor us,</i>
<i>except on thls frequency.</i>

01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:55.687
Roger, Colonel, sir.

01:14:55.899 --> 01:15:00.302
Climb up to 35,000 feet and relax
until we hit the first refuel.

01:15:22.092 --> 01:15:23.923
<i>Get your alr speed perfect.</i>

01:15:24.261 --> 01:15:25.819
Come in real steady.

01:15:29.199 --> 01:15:32.100
Congratulations!
Couldn't have done better myself.

01:15:32.436 --> 01:15:35.496
Do they pump this for you,
or is this self-service?

01:15:35.939 --> 01:15:37.804
Smart-ass kids!

01:15:51.621 --> 01:15:52.747
Are you sleeping?

01:15:53.123 --> 01:15:54.021
Everything okay?

01:15:54.391 --> 01:15:56.120
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:15:57.461 --> 01:15:59.793
I just felt all alone all of a sudden.

01:16:00.230 --> 01:16:01.629
Try not to think about it.

01:16:02.799 --> 01:16:06.200
<i>Just thlnk about your dad,</i>
<i>and how alone he must feel.</i>

01:16:06.636 --> 01:16:09.867
Do you think he knows
how much I really love him?

01:16:10.307 --> 01:16:13.037
Sometimes he'd be tough with me,
like you are.

01:16:14.144 --> 01:16:18.376
I know it's only for my own good,
but I never told him I understood.

01:16:18.748 --> 01:16:19.840
He knows.

01:16:20.083 --> 01:16:21.311
Believe me.

01:16:22.319 --> 01:16:24.048
He just wants to
make a man out of you.

01:16:24.821 --> 01:16:27.051
Is that why
you treat me the same way?

01:16:27.491 --> 01:16:29.220
To make a man out of me?

01:16:29.659 --> 01:16:31.559
No, your dad already did that.

01:16:33.497 --> 01:16:36.523
I'm just trying to
get us out of this alive.

01:16:36.833 --> 01:16:39.063
Chap, what if I screw up?

01:16:39.769 --> 01:16:41.361
What if everything goes wrong?

01:16:41.671 --> 01:16:43.400
Then I'll get real mad!

01:16:44.174 --> 01:16:45.732
You've never seen me mad!

01:16:47.444 --> 01:16:48.877
I wouldn't want to, either.

01:16:49.179 --> 01:16:50.373
Then don't screw up!

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:53.578
<i>Thlnk about the plan.</i>
<i>Go over It In your head...</i>

01:16:53.783 --> 01:16:57.913
<i>... every step of It In your head</i>
<i>untll you have got It automatlc.</i>

01:17:03.193 --> 01:17:05.923
I still show a 7-minute delay
from my first refuel.

01:17:06.196 --> 01:17:07.561
We've got to make up time.

01:17:08.031 --> 01:17:11.432
<i>We'll break our fllght plan</i>
<i>In 5 mlnutes. Do your verlflcatlon.</i>

01:17:11.868 --> 01:17:13.062
It'll heat up from here.

01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:14.234
<i>How do you feel?</i>

01:17:14.538 --> 01:17:16.199
My stomach's a little tight.

01:17:16.873 --> 01:17:18.636
Must be that cereal I ate.

01:17:18.975 --> 01:17:21.273
It's funny.
It tastes good going down...

01:17:21.711 --> 01:17:25.112
...then 13 hours later, it makes you
scared shitless. It will pass.

01:17:25.549 --> 01:17:27.107
Do a checkout list.

01:17:46.403 --> 01:17:48.462
They'll know something's up now.

01:17:49.906 --> 01:17:52.136
If checkpoint contacts us, ignore it.

01:17:52.576 --> 01:17:55.977
<i>By the tlme they flgure It out,</i>
<i>we'll be over the coast.</i>

01:17:56.179 --> 01:17:57.612
Bring up the stores list.

01:18:00.083 --> 01:18:04.383
Watch that carefully. Keep it
in your head. It's all you got.

01:18:04.621 --> 01:18:06.919
<i>Look at your fuel gauge.</i>
<i>It's all you got too.</i>

01:18:07.123 --> 01:18:09.887
Run out of either one of them,
you're dead meat.

01:18:10.594 --> 01:18:11.822
I got that.

01:18:12.262 --> 01:18:16.494
<i>We're runnlng at Mach.6. Drop</i>
<i>to 3,000 feet and hold your alr speed.</i>

01:18:16.933 --> 01:18:18.833
<i>Watch out for naval vessels.</i>

01:18:19.269 --> 01:18:23.171
<i>Falcon 1, you have devlated</i>
<i>from your fllght plan.</i>

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.005
<i>Please advlse.</i>

01:18:28.111 --> 01:18:29.442
Just you and me, kid.

01:18:29.779 --> 01:18:33.408
<i>Drop down to 3000 feet,</i>
<i>llke I told you.</i>

01:18:33.617 --> 01:18:36.848
<i>When we're 100 mlles off the coast,</i>
<i>drop to 400 feet.</i>

01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:39.620
<i>Keep under that</i>
<i>or they'll see you on radar.</i>

01:18:39.956 --> 01:18:41.184
I know that.

01:18:41.625 --> 01:18:43.786
<i>I bet you thought you knew that.</i>

01:18:44.294 --> 01:18:46.990
Did you know their missiles
got French radar?

01:18:47.297 --> 01:18:49.424
<i>You can fool them</i>
<i>wlth foll packs.</i>

01:18:49.633 --> 01:18:50.759
I didn't know that.

01:18:51.034 --> 01:18:52.296
Bet you didn't know that.

01:18:53.637 --> 01:18:54.467
Didn't think so.

01:18:54.804 --> 01:18:57.705
<i>Hlt the coast, punch It to Mach.9,</i>
<i>but not supersonlc.</i>

01:18:58.141 --> 01:19:00.132
<i>It'd be too easy</i>
<i>to know we're comlng.</i>

01:19:01.611 --> 01:19:04.705
When we reach the mountains,
stay low and hug them tight.

01:19:05.148 --> 01:19:07.844
"Snake" them right, and they won't know
what hit them.

01:19:08.318 --> 01:19:12.721
<i>You go for the runway, and I'll take</i>
<i>out the tower and communlcatlons.</i>

01:19:13.156 --> 01:19:14.885
<i>Don't mlss.</i>

01:19:15.325 --> 01:19:18.556
<i>You've only got</i> 4 <i>clusters.</i>
<i>Make each one count.</i>

01:19:18.995 --> 01:19:20.826
<i>Make sure you llne them up rlght.</i>

01:19:21.931 --> 01:19:23.364
<i>And play the rlght muslc.</i>

01:19:23.767 --> 01:19:26.736
These guys ain't no rookies
that shot down your dad.

01:19:27.170 --> 01:19:28.728
You won't freeze up?

01:19:29.172 --> 01:19:31.140
Anybody ever say you talk too much?

01:19:31.441 --> 01:19:33.739
Yeah, my ex-wife.

01:19:34.511 --> 01:19:37.480
<i>There's the enemy coast.</i>
<i>Start the jammlng.</i>

01:19:50.694 --> 01:19:52.389
<i>Comlng up to the mountalns.</i>

01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:54.597
Radar hasn't caught us so far.

01:19:55.298 --> 01:19:58.165
We're still 7 minutes behind schedule.

01:19:58.401 --> 01:20:02.497
<i>Remember, they run mornlng maneuvers</i>
<i>at 0730. We must plck up tlme...</i>

01:20:02.772 --> 01:20:04.399
...or we'll be in MiG soup.

01:20:04.874 --> 01:20:07.172
<i>Stay below 300 feet to beat the radar.</i>

01:20:07.377 --> 01:20:11.438
<i>I got somethlng to help make up</i>
<i>some tlme. Keep the channel clear.</i>

01:20:11.881 --> 01:20:13.246
This ain't no game!

01:20:18.722 --> 01:20:19.950
I could get used to that.

01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:28.457
We made up 3 minutes.

01:20:29.065 --> 01:20:30.555
<i>Radar hasn't plcked us up yet.</i>

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.631
<i>It's 7:30.</i>
<i>I hope they're late.</i>

01:20:32.836 --> 01:20:34.531
<i>I don't want to thlnk about lt.</i>

01:20:34.804 --> 01:20:36.863
Get ready.
Il Kharem is coming up.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.715
They picked us up on radar!

01:20:52.956 --> 01:20:54.480
Too late for them now.

01:20:54.924 --> 01:20:57.893
Just cluster that runway.
I'll do the rest.

01:21:27.123 --> 01:21:28.420
<i>Three MIGs have taken off.</i>

01:21:28.892 --> 01:21:32.123
We'll handle them in the air.
Just take out that runway!

01:22:29.853 --> 01:22:32.720
I hit it!
I got the runway and the plane.

01:22:33.022 --> 01:22:36.423
Congratulate yourself later.
Now worry about those 3 MiGs.

01:23:01.217 --> 01:23:02.149
Climb!

01:23:45.194 --> 01:23:46.718
They're running away!

01:24:05.214 --> 01:24:08.445
They're just getting out of the way.
Move your butt!

01:24:08.851 --> 01:24:10.284
<i>Get out of range</i>
<i>of the guns!</i>

01:24:22.398 --> 01:24:23.387
Damn!

01:24:38.615 --> 01:24:40.981
<i>I got them!</i>
<i>I got all three of the guns!</i>

01:24:41.484 --> 01:24:43.645
Yeah, but one of them got me.

01:24:44.153 --> 01:24:44.983
How bad?

01:24:45.188 --> 01:24:47.418
Didn't get me head-on.
But close enough.

01:24:54.831 --> 01:24:55.923
What kind of damage?

01:24:56.132 --> 01:24:57.895
All kinds of electrical problems.

01:25:01.738 --> 01:25:03.672
<i>Two MIGs comlng up fast.</i>

01:25:03.873 --> 01:25:05.465
Follow me.
Listen carefully.

01:25:05.675 --> 01:25:08.235
<i>I want you to load the tape</i>
<i>I made you thls mornlng.</i>

01:25:08.444 --> 01:25:09.934
What? What's on it?

01:25:10.146 --> 01:25:11.408
Don't argue with me!

01:25:12.181 --> 01:25:13.011
Is it loaded yet?

01:25:14.117 --> 01:25:16.108
Don't interrupt.
I'll only say this once.

01:25:16.319 --> 01:25:19.049
<i>Anythlng happens to me,</i>
<i>cllmb out of weapon range...</i>

01:25:19.255 --> 01:25:20.347
...and play that tape.

01:25:20.723 --> 01:25:22.418
It may be the only thing
to save your ass.

01:25:22.625 --> 01:25:24.320
Nothing's going to happen to you.

01:25:24.494 --> 01:25:25.756
<i>Llsten to me.</i>

01:25:25.962 --> 01:25:28.123
<i>When the MIGs get In range,</i>
<i>spllt from me...</i>

01:25:28.331 --> 01:25:29.992
<i>... and proceed</i>
<i>to the next target.</i>

01:25:30.199 --> 01:25:32.690
<i>One wlll follow you</i>
<i>and one wlll follow me.</i>

01:25:32.902 --> 01:25:35.928
<i>I'll head toward the Medlterranean.</i>
<i>Don't let them get the drop on you.</i>

01:25:36.239 --> 01:25:39.470
I want to stay with you.
How can you handle them?

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:41.234
Don't you worry about me.

01:25:41.444 --> 01:25:43.639
Just do what I told you.
And concentrate.

01:25:43.846 --> 01:25:45.211
<i>Your dad Is dependlng on you.</i>

01:25:45.481 --> 01:25:47.949
<i>Spllt off from me now!</i>

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.643
All right, you bastard!

01:26:49.545 --> 01:26:52.742
Give me your position. I waxed
a bandit and I'm coming to you.

01:26:53.015 --> 01:26:54.243
I told you, damn it!

01:26:54.517 --> 01:26:57.008
<i>Put In that tape,</i>
<i>and don't worry about me.</i>

01:27:06.896 --> 01:27:07.726
Damn it!

01:27:08.731 --> 01:27:10.926
Just hold together
for two more seconds.

01:27:46.569 --> 01:27:47.627
Mayday.

01:27:47.804 --> 01:27:49.101
<i>Mayday.</i>

01:27:49.505 --> 01:27:51.370
Chappy, where are you?

01:27:51.574 --> 01:27:54.099
Put in that tape. That's an order.
Nothing you can do about me.

01:27:54.343 --> 01:27:56.402
<i>I want to help you.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:27:56.612 --> 01:27:58.273

01:28:25.842 --> 01:28:28.140
<i>I wouldn't blame you If you</i>

01:28:28.344 --> 01:28:31.677
<i>Maybe If I was you, I'd make a run</i>

01:28:33.683 --> 01:28:35.446

<i>God doesn't glve people</i>

01:28:45.528 --> 01:28:48.395
<i>And he gave you the touch.</i>

01:28:49.599 --> 01:28:51.829
<i>It's a power you have</i>
<i>Inslde of you.</i>

<i>It's all you need</i>

<i>Your dad's slttlng there</i>

01:29:36.212 --> 01:29:39.704
<i>I recorded some stuff to help you</i>

<i>... to knock the shlt</i>

01:30:00.436 --> 01:30:02.267
How long to repair your runways?

01:30:02.471 --> 01:30:04.371
It could be repaired...

01:30:04.573 --> 01:30:05.540
...in less than an hour.

01:30:05.741 --> 01:30:07.902
Put every man you have on it.

01:30:08.411 --> 01:30:09.639
I want...

01:30:09.912 --> 01:30:12.904
...these pigs blown out
of the sky.

01:30:13.115 --> 01:30:13.979
Yes, sir.

01:30:16.018 --> 01:30:17.747
They're coming for the American.

01:30:18.087 --> 01:30:20.487
Inform the prison
to be prepared to move him.

01:30:20.690 --> 01:30:22.783
We may need him as a decoy.

01:30:23.993 --> 01:30:26.393
I want all anti-aircraft mobilized...

01:30:26.595 --> 01:30:30.156
...and I want defense command
to find their planes.

01:30:34.036 --> 01:30:35.003
Now!

01:30:39.141 --> 01:30:40.108
All right, Chap.

01:30:40.409 --> 01:30:41.842
80 miles to Bilyad.

01:30:43.179 --> 01:30:45.443
<i>Keep a close eye</i>
<i>on that stores llst.</i>

01:30:45.948 --> 01:30:47.609
<i>I thought of somethlng.</i>

01:30:47.817 --> 01:30:50.115
<i>If thelr radar dldn't plck us up</i>
<i>through the mountalns...</i>

01:30:50.319 --> 01:30:51.980
<i>... then there's somethlng</i>
<i>they may not know.</i>

01:30:52.188 --> 01:30:53.018
How many planes.

01:30:53.222 --> 01:30:55.156
<i>They won't know</i>
<i>how many flghters there are.</i>

01:30:55.358 --> 01:30:57.758
<i>They'll never thlnk It's just you.</i>

01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:00.258
<i>So when you contact them,</i>
<i>tell them there's more of you.</i>

01:31:01.630 --> 01:31:03.598
<i>Now, they aln't got no MIGs there.</i>

01:31:03.799 --> 01:31:06.529
<i>But remember those choppers.</i>
<i>Any of thelr rockets hlt you...</i>

01:31:06.736 --> 01:31:09.034
<i>... you'll be llvlng permanently</i>
<i>In them clouds.</i>

01:31:09.472 --> 01:31:12.600
<i>Recon showed surface-to-alr unlts.</i>
<i>Watch out for them.</i>

01:31:12.808 --> 01:31:15.504
<i>They'll probably expect you.</i>
<i>You know what to do from here on In.</i>

01:31:16.512 --> 01:31:17.342
<i>Good luck, man.</i>

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:26.711
This one's for you.

01:32:26.382 --> 01:32:27.576
<i>Thls Is Iron Eagle.</i>

01:32:28.451 --> 01:32:31.249
I am the flight leader
of an American assault force...

01:32:31.454 --> 01:32:32.944
<i>... sent to recover Col. Ted Masters...</i>

01:32:33.155 --> 01:32:35.715

01:32:44.266 --> 01:32:47.133

<i>I want to see an escort leave</i>

<i>Do you understand?</i>

01:33:03.252 --> 01:33:04.480
Pigs.

01:33:08.257 --> 01:33:11.488
I want an armed escort
at the detention center...

01:33:11.727 --> 01:33:13.820
...standing by for my orders.

01:33:15.264 --> 01:33:16.993
And prepare my car.

01:33:18.601 --> 01:33:20.501
I am going to the airport.

01:33:23.439 --> 01:33:25.498
I want these people...

01:33:27.109 --> 01:33:28.838
...destroyed.

01:33:35.985 --> 01:33:37.418
You were right, Chap.

01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:40.783
They're not moving him.
Looks like they're trying to stall.

01:33:42.925 --> 01:33:45.519
<i>Bllyad Tower,</i>
<i>thls Is Iron Eagle.</i>

01:33:47.396 --> 01:33:48.385
We hear you.

01:33:48.597 --> 01:33:50.827
He's not being moved.
What's the problem?

01:33:51.033 --> 01:33:54.799
They are having trouble finding
a jeep suitable for your purposes.

01:33:55.137 --> 01:33:57.765
Bullshit! You got
a whole town full of them.

01:33:57.973 --> 01:33:59.372
You just lost a refinery.

01:34:02.978 --> 01:34:04.104
All right, Chappy.

01:34:04.313 --> 01:34:07.282
Let's see how they feel about
losing 100 million in oil.

01:34:10.886 --> 01:34:12.547
I'm just about to the refinery.

01:34:13.789 --> 01:34:15.552
I'm going for the tanks.

01:34:26.635 --> 01:34:28.432
I wish you could see this.

01:34:28.637 --> 01:34:30.969
<i>Looks llke they'll be</i>
<i>lmportlng oll thls year.</i>

01:34:39.782 --> 01:34:41.909
That pilot is a dead man.

01:34:44.587 --> 01:34:46.578
How much longer
to repair the runway?

01:34:47.223 --> 01:34:48.247
At least 10 minutes.

01:34:48.457 --> 01:34:50.755
Tell them to move faster
or they'll hang.

01:34:52.328 --> 01:34:54.762
And tell them to move
the American now.

01:34:56.632 --> 01:34:58.463
I want them to be together...

01:34:58.667 --> 01:34:59.497
...when they die.

01:35:28.364 --> 01:35:29.262
They're moving him!

01:35:33.569 --> 01:35:34.729
See you soon, Dad.

01:35:34.937 --> 01:35:35.869
How long now?

01:35:36.071 --> 01:35:36.901
Any minute.

01:35:37.106 --> 01:35:39.904
Get the mobile units into position,
but out of sight.

01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:41.474
No one fires...

01:35:41.677 --> 01:35:43.611
...until I give permission.

01:35:47.483 --> 01:35:49.474
<i>I'm assumlng they're movlng hlm.</i>

01:35:49.685 --> 01:35:51.346
<i>I can't tell you</i>
<i>what to do anymore.</i>

01:35:51.553 --> 01:35:53.987
<i>Remember what I told you</i>
<i>about the Hades bomb.</i>

01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:57.022
<i>Land, plck up your dad</i>
<i>and get your butt out of there.</i>

01:35:57.226 --> 01:35:58.921
<i>And keep track of your ammo.</i>

01:35:59.128 --> 01:36:01.221
<i>I'm rlght there wlth you.</i>
<i>Don't forget that.</i>

01:36:06.835 --> 01:36:07.733
Everybody step out!

01:36:12.441 --> 01:36:13.806
You, drive to the runway.

01:36:14.009 --> 01:36:15.943
Drive to the runway!

01:36:16.445 --> 01:36:17.912
Move!

01:36:42.004 --> 01:36:43.801
Can you confirm any other planes?

01:36:44.006 --> 01:36:44.938
Nothing, sir.

01:36:48.744 --> 01:36:50.371
Let him land.

01:36:51.313 --> 01:36:52.177
Then...

01:36:52.381 --> 01:36:54.815
...cut him to pieces.

01:36:56.885 --> 01:36:58.614
Tell him to get ready
on my command.

01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:12.392
Goddamn it!

01:37:12.668 --> 01:37:15.159
I'm coming down, Dad.
Here I come.

01:37:17.539 --> 01:37:18.904
Kill him now.

01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:28.873
You son of a bitch!

01:38:15.431 --> 01:38:16.898
Everyone out!

01:38:50.365 --> 01:38:52.026
Move your troops down the runway.

01:38:52.234 --> 01:38:53.861
Finish off the American!

01:39:18.093 --> 01:39:19.082
Holy shit!

01:39:23.365 --> 01:39:25.458
Attack them through the flames!

01:39:28.303 --> 01:39:30.032
The Americans must die.

01:39:30.239 --> 01:39:33.333
Or none of you will live
to regret your mistakes.

01:39:50.092 --> 01:39:51.150
Is that you?

01:39:53.962 --> 01:39:55.156
Are you all right?

01:39:56.431 --> 01:39:57.489
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:39:57.699 --> 01:40:00.896
Can you walk? We haven't got
much time. Come on.

01:40:02.905 --> 01:40:04.896
We'll talk later. Come on.

01:40:05.107 --> 01:40:06.734
Come on, Dad.
You can make it.

01:40:18.554 --> 01:40:20.579
One step and you're home, Dad.

01:40:22.357 --> 01:40:24.723
Send me two brave men.

01:40:25.594 --> 01:40:27.755
If there are any left among you.

01:40:27.963 --> 01:40:29.191
Where's your air support?

01:40:29.965 --> 01:40:31.762
I only came in
with Chappy Sinclair.

01:40:32.734 --> 01:40:33.996
They took him out
at II Kharem.

01:40:39.174 --> 01:40:40.539
Jesus, Dad!

01:40:40.742 --> 01:40:44.075
- Can we still fire on the ground?
- I don't know. Why?

01:40:44.413 --> 01:40:46.438
Something's about
to have us for breakfast.

01:41:05.267 --> 01:41:06.757
They got up some MiGs.

01:41:06.969 --> 01:41:08.596
Take off.
We'll fight in the air.

01:41:14.776 --> 01:41:16.744
Flight Commander,
this is Col. Nakesh.

01:41:17.045 --> 01:41:18.740
<i>Respond lmmedlately.</i>

01:41:19.281 --> 01:41:21.613
Which of your squadron
is most heavily armed?

01:41:21.817 --> 01:41:23.682
<i>Major Joradl. Fully loaded.</i>

01:41:23.885 --> 01:41:25.375
Have him land
on this field at once.

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.058
How much fuel?

01:41:33.295 --> 01:41:34.455
2100 pounds.

01:41:35.163 --> 01:41:37.927
You better get to the Med quick.
Climb as high as you can.

01:41:48.176 --> 01:41:49.108
Get down!

01:41:49.311 --> 01:41:51.074
Get out of
your flight suit now!

01:41:51.813 --> 01:41:52.939
<i>Call up your stores.</i>

01:41:53.515 --> 01:41:55.983
Two Sidewinders and 244 rounds.

01:41:56.418 --> 01:41:59.182
We'll never reach safety.
We're burning fuel too fast.

01:42:03.959 --> 01:42:05.119
We have to take them on.

01:42:05.327 --> 01:42:07.727
I guess so.
Think you can you handle a loop?

01:42:07.929 --> 01:42:09.362
Think you can handle the music?

01:42:53.809 --> 01:42:54.867
One down, one to go.

01:43:20.635 --> 01:43:23.126
<i>You may deal dlrectly wlth me now.</i>

01:43:23.405 --> 01:43:24.804
Colonel Akir Nakesh.

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:28.032
Then you can deal with me, Doug Masters.

01:43:31.046 --> 01:43:32.104
Watch it, son.

01:43:33.982 --> 01:43:37.042
Nice shot.
Anything else you want to send over?

01:43:37.319 --> 01:43:38.718
<i>Way to fly, Doug.</i>

01:43:43.391 --> 01:43:45.723
You are a dead man.
Do you know that?

01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:49.556
<i>Turn out!</i>

01:43:53.568 --> 01:43:55.160
<i>Steady up, Doug.</i>

01:43:55.670 --> 01:43:58.571
<i>Thls guy's an ace.</i>
<i>He knows what he's dolng.</i>

01:43:59.975 --> 01:44:01.636
<i>Don't let hlm stay behlnd you.</i>

01:44:03.178 --> 01:44:04.509
<i>Move lt, Doug.</i>

01:44:04.746 --> 01:44:07.146
<i>Pltch out! Pltch away from hlm!</i>

01:44:07.349 --> 01:44:09.579
Time to die, Iron Eagle.

01:44:10.452 --> 01:44:11.749
<i>Roll out!</i>

01:44:11.953 --> 01:44:14.148
Okay, Dad, I'm taking this guy out.

01:44:15.323 --> 01:44:17.621
<i>Stay wlth hlm, Dougle. Stay wlth hlm.</i>

01:44:17.826 --> 01:44:18.952
<i>You own hlm.</i>

01:44:21.429 --> 01:44:24.421
<i>You can take hlm, Doug.</i>
<i>You can do lt!</i>

01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:27.634
<i>That's lt.</i>
<i>Take a steady straln.</i>

01:44:38.847 --> 01:44:40.678
So long, asshole.

01:44:51.059 --> 01:44:52.526
Dad! More MiGs!

01:44:52.727 --> 01:44:54.524
I don't think she can
take much more.

01:44:54.729 --> 01:44:55.696
What's our stats?

01:44:57.332 --> 01:44:59.459
Only 30 rounds, 800 pounds of fuel.

01:44:59.668 --> 01:45:02.432
Too chancy to face them.
Try to outrun them.

01:45:02.637 --> 01:45:03.661
I hope you're right.

01:45:03.872 --> 01:45:05.840
Taking her to Mach 1.

01:45:16.117 --> 01:45:17.812
I can't keep up this speed.

01:45:18.019 --> 01:45:20.078
We'll have to slow down or dump it.

01:45:20.322 --> 01:45:21.380
We'll have to face them.

01:45:21.756 --> 01:45:22.586
I'm ready.

01:45:23.859 --> 01:45:25.053
Four more jumping us!

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:26.691
Pull up hard!

01:45:30.498 --> 01:45:32.989
<i>Thls Is Blue Leader.</i>
<i>Do you read?</i>

01:45:33.335 --> 01:45:34.927
They're ours, Dad!

01:45:35.337 --> 01:45:36.929
<i>They're Amerlcans!</i>

01:45:37.205 --> 01:45:38.194
<i>Roger, Blue Leader.</i>

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:40.931
I got two bandits on my ass.
Can you assist?

01:45:41.343 --> 01:45:45.746
<i>Roger. We're about to contact the</i>
<i>aggressor and verlfy hls Intentlons.</i>

01:45:46.181 --> 01:45:50.584
Attention, unidentified aircraft.
This is Major Smiley, U.S. Air Force.

01:45:51.019 --> 01:45:55.080
<i>You are followlng one of our F-16s</i>
<i>In Internatlonal alrspace.</i>

01:45:55.690 --> 01:45:57.681
<i>Do you wlsh to engage?</i>

01:45:59.127 --> 01:46:00.219
I didn't think so.

01:46:00.528 --> 01:46:03.361
<i>The MIGs do not wlsh to engage</i>
<i>at thls tlme.</i>

01:46:03.632 --> 01:46:05.600
<i>Were you able to retrleve</i>
<i>Colonel Masters?</i>

01:46:06.001 --> 01:46:07.696
He's here with me, Major.

01:46:08.036 --> 01:46:10.027
<i>Congratulatlons. Welcome home.</i>

01:46:10.538 --> 01:46:13.803
We were worried about you since we
got the mayday from Col. Sinclair.

01:46:14.009 --> 01:46:15.601
We thought you went down with him.

01:46:15.844 --> 01:46:17.209
Did you find the wreckage?

01:46:17.412 --> 01:46:18.606
Only parts of it.

01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:20.538
<i>Scattered all over the Med.</i>

01:46:20.882 --> 01:46:24.113
<i>We'll escort you to Ramsteln Alr</i>
<i>Force base In West Germany.</i>

01:46:24.319 --> 01:46:25.718
We have a fuel problem.

01:46:26.054 --> 01:46:28.989
Don't worry. There's a fuel tanker
standing by.

01:46:30.325 --> 01:46:31.519
Major?

01:46:31.893 --> 01:46:35.624
Can we fly the Missing Man formation for
Colonel Sinclair?

01:46:36.064 --> 01:46:37.463
<i>We're already In posltlon.</i>

01:46:37.899 --> 01:46:42.165
<i>We'd be honored If you'd</i>
<i>ease up front and take the lead.</i>

01:46:49.911 --> 01:46:52.937
Chappy wanted me to play this for you
as soon as we were safe.

01:46:54.482 --> 01:46:57.451
<i>Good mornlng, Col. Masters.</i>
<i>Thls Is Col. Chappy Slnclalr.</i>

01:46:57.752 --> 01:46:59.913
<i>I guess by now you're</i>
<i>over the Medlterranean.</i>

01:47:00.121 --> 01:47:02.589
<i>Hope you feel good.</i>
<i>You'll be home soon.</i>

01:47:02.857 --> 01:47:04.950
<i>I don't have to tell you</i>
<i>what klnd of son you got.</i>

01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:06.525
<i>I'm sure you already know.</i>

01:47:06.761 --> 01:47:10.197
<i>I'm sure you'd llke to know</i>
<i>how he got over to you.</i>

01:47:10.598 --> 01:47:14.261
<i>Thls kld comes up to me one day and</i>
<i>tells me he's got a problem...</i>

01:47:14.602 --> 01:47:16.092
<i>... and could I help hlm.</i>

01:47:16.371 --> 01:47:19.534
<i>He was a cocky guy,</i>
<i>kept telllng me how good he could fly.</i>

01:47:46.468 --> 01:47:50.029
Nice of you to join us for the occasion,
Mr. Iron Eagle, sir!

01:47:57.479 --> 01:47:59.470
They told us you went down in the Med.

01:47:59.681 --> 01:48:02.149
I did. I had to do
a little dog paddling...

01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:04.545
...until I got picked up
by an Egyptian trawler.

01:48:04.786 --> 01:48:07.084
Your dad said it didn't go
easy for you either.

01:48:07.255 --> 01:48:10.747
- Is Dad coming to this?
- He's still in debriefing.

01:48:11.326 --> 01:48:13.157
It's just you and me, kid.

01:48:13.995 --> 01:48:17.829
They're going to put us in jail.
You know that, don't you?

01:48:19.167 --> 01:48:22.534
Whatever they do, keep your head up
and your shoulders back.

01:48:22.771 --> 01:48:24.830
They like it when you stand tall.

01:48:41.856 --> 01:48:43.346
Stand at ease.

01:48:46.528 --> 01:48:48.587
I've read the statements of all
the principals...

01:48:48.797 --> 01:48:51.527
...involved in this
highly irregular operation.

01:48:51.866 --> 01:48:55.097
You both stand accused of violating
virtually every section...

01:48:55.303 --> 01:48:56.634
...of the National Security Act.

01:48:56.938 --> 01:48:59.805
The penalty for such violations
could incarcerate you...

01:49:00.041 --> 01:49:01.975
...for the next 25 years.

01:49:04.879 --> 01:49:07.109
Have any idea of the consequences
of your actions?

01:49:07.348 --> 01:49:08.975
If the details came to light...

01:49:09.184 --> 01:49:11.209
...it would undermine public
confidence...

01:49:11.419 --> 01:49:13.250
...in this branch of military service.

01:49:13.555 --> 01:49:15.147
What the hell were we supposed to do?

01:49:15.824 --> 01:49:17.951
No one lifted a finger to help my dad.

01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:20.257
Mr. Masters...

01:49:20.495 --> 01:49:21.860
...have you given any thought...

01:49:22.063 --> 01:49:24.054
...to the penalties
that could be imposed on you?

01:49:24.732 --> 01:49:26.029
Yes, sir, I have.

01:49:26.234 --> 01:49:28.498
And were those thoughts pleasant?

01:49:28.703 --> 01:49:29.567
No, sir.

01:49:29.771 --> 01:49:32.262
I'm glad. Keep them in mind.

01:49:32.507 --> 01:49:35.271
Because if you talk
about this operation to anyone...

01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:39.844
...l'll guarantee you those penalties
will be imposed immediately!

01:49:41.916 --> 01:49:44.407
Does this mean you're letting us go?

01:49:44.752 --> 01:49:48.279
This means your release
is conditional on your silence!

01:49:48.523 --> 01:49:51.219
I urge you to re-evaluate that decision.

01:49:51.593 --> 01:49:54.027
Letting this boy loose
would be a big mistake.

01:49:54.362 --> 01:49:58.765
He's already demonstrated his
inability to keep his mouth shut.

01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:01.000
I'd suggest
sending him to an institution...

01:50:01.236 --> 01:50:03.431
that can order him to keep...

01:50:03.771 --> 01:50:05.602
...that big mouth shut!

01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:10.377
Are you saying we should confine him to
some sort of penal facility?

01:50:10.645 --> 01:50:13.614
Well, in a manner of speaking, yes, sir.

01:50:15.283 --> 01:50:18.946
You see, Mr. Masters has applied
to the Air Force Academy...

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:21.880
...an institution well-suited
for this treatment.

01:50:22.290 --> 01:50:25.953
Unfortunately, his application
has met with some resistance.

01:50:26.327 --> 01:50:28.454
I was wondering if you could...

01:50:30.732 --> 01:50:34.668
This aircraft, by order of the President
of the United States...

01:50:34.869 --> 01:50:38.305
...has just arrived from Ramstein
Air Force Base, West Germany...

01:50:38.573 --> 01:50:42.202
...where Col. Ted Masters was recovering
from the rescue operation...

01:50:42.410 --> 01:50:45.311
...which freed him from his captors
three days ago.

01:50:45.647 --> 01:50:48.309
As reported earlier, the Air Force
sent a squadron of F-16s...

01:50:48.583 --> 01:50:51.643
...to mount a crippling attack on
hostile forces.

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:54.480
The operation resulted
in no American losses...

01:50:54.689 --> 01:50:56.748
...enemy casualties
were termed as minor.

01:50:56.991 --> 01:50:59.357
In fact,
details of the entire mission...

01:50:59.594 --> 01:51:01.687
...have been strictly classified
by the State Department.

01:51:05.333 --> 01:51:09.429
Col. Masters is followed by Air
Force Reserve Col. Charles Sinclair.

01:51:10.171 --> 01:51:13.004
Sources close to the Air Force
have uncovered a rumor...

01:51:13.341 --> 01:51:16.333
...that Colonel Sinclair aided
in planning the rescue attempt.

01:51:16.644 --> 01:51:19.670
However, we've done some local
investigating...

01:51:20.014 --> 01:51:22.414
...and find this to be highly unlikely.

01:51:22.617 --> 01:51:25.950
The young man who has come out is
Master's son, Doug...

01:51:26.187 --> 01:51:28.178
...who accompanied his father home.

01:51:28.456 --> 01:51:30.822
As you can see,
he seems to have quite a following.

01:51:31.025 --> 01:51:33.687
Incidentally, Doug has received
an appointment...

01:51:34.028 --> 01:51:36.861
...to the U.S. Air Force Academy
in Colorado this fall.

01:51:37.232 --> 01:51:40.531
He'll follow in his father's footsteps
and take orders from the Air Force.

01:51:40.868 --> 01:51:43.359
He's quite a capable young Cessna pilot.

01:51:43.705 --> 01:51:48.540
I'm sure he can't wait for the thrill of
flying more advanced Air Force jets.

01:51:49.811 --> 01:51:53.008
For Channel 6, this is Jeff Tamblin.
Back to you in the studio.

01:51:57.218 --> 01:51:59.083
You did it, man! Unbelievable!

01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:00.412
You pulled it off!

01:52:00.622 --> 01:52:02.112
All right!

01:52:05.827 --> 01:52:07.294
Eagle!

01:52:15.336 --> 01:52:16.928
I forgot to give these back to you.

01:52:18.239 --> 01:52:20.730
Keep them. You've earned them.
