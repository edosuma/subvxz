Here you go.

00:35.916 --> 00:36.951
Hey...

00:37.185 --> 00:38.442
What do you say?

00:44.058 --> 00:46.024
What?

00:46.144 --> 00:47.570
Are you hungry too?

00:48.128 --> 00:49.762
Not enough food.

00:50.185 --> 00:51.731
"There's not enough food."

00:51.932 --> 00:53.466
"There's not enough food."

00:53.701 --> 00:55.032
Make less on plates.

00:55.782 --> 00:57.959
"Put less on the plates."

00:58.079 --> 00:59.441
Whatevs.

01:00.510 --> 01:02.504
You don't know your verbs
but you know "whatevs"?

01:02.870 --> 01:04.178
Whatevs.

01:04.843 --> 01:06.117
Don't worry about the food.

01:06.465 --> 01:08.120
More is coming.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.364
When?

01:10.342 --> 01:11.312
Soon.

01:11.432 --> 01:12.284
Hey...

01:12.592 --> 01:14.458
Haven't I always got what we need?

01:14.833 --> 01:16.599
There's a truck coming tonight.

01:16.900 --> 01:19.425
Until truck, put less on the plates.

01:22.929 --> 01:24.246
Whatevs.

Three truck.

Trucks coming.

03:58.928 --> 04:00.666
"The truck is coming."

04:00.712 --> 04:01.544
No...

04:01.572 --> 04:03.438
Three truck is coming.

04:04.486 --> 04:06.365
Three trucks is coming?

Please come in.

05:41.947 --> 05:43.676
Follow me, please.

05:45.871 --> 05:47.526
What does this guy do?

05:47.646 --> 05:50.298
Arbitrage: making money on money.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.200
How did he get my name?

05:52.941 --> 05:55.301
... 24 hours, guys, OK?

05:57.204 --> 05:59.334
Mr. Martin, Cat.

05:59.544 --> 06:01.063
Thank you for coming.

06:02.773 --> 06:04.447
Please, sit down.

06:10.118 --> 06:12.696
This couldn't happen at a worse time.

06:12.816 --> 06:14.564
I'm 24 hours

06:14.564 --> 06:17.500
from a three billion dollar
takeover of Franken Bear.

06:17.509 --> 06:19.787
Otherwise, I would go to Mauritania myself.

06:19.907 --> 06:22.272
Not a good idea, crossing
the local warlord.

06:22.392 --> 06:23.192
No...

06:23.208 --> 06:24.642
But not unlike Zac.

06:24.644 --> 06:25.695
My...

06:25.715 --> 06:28.019
My son means well, but...

06:28.285 --> 06:30.165
he's strong-willed, to say the least.

06:30.195 --> 06:31.833
Who contacted you?

06:32.070 --> 06:34.860
A local man by the name of Ayoob.

06:34.980 --> 06:36.561
Did he say where we could find him?

06:36.571 --> 06:37.275
No.

06:37.395 --> 06:40.586
It was just that Zac was
begging for me to get help.

06:40.706 --> 06:43.293
And also that somehow he's been wounded.

06:43.413 --> 06:44.656
Wounded?

06:45.936 --> 06:47.372
I think he's been shot.

06:50.573 --> 06:52.286
It's a remote area.

06:52.302 --> 06:53.866
A Westerner looking for your son

06:53.884 --> 06:55.787
would quickly become a target as well.

06:55.787 --> 06:57.149
I understand that.

06:58.457 --> 07:01.320
But Cat tells me you're
the best at what you do.

07:04.896 --> 07:07.356
I will pay any fee you ask.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.037
I'm sure you could afford it.

07:10.429 --> 07:12.387
But I'm not sure success is possible.

07:12.408 --> 07:13.557
What you need is an airlift.

07:13.585 --> 07:16.420
I have had the Embassy
on the phone non-stop.

07:16.439 --> 07:18.424
They say it's simply not an option.

07:22.960 --> 07:26.755
This is the first time
since he was a teenager

07:27.469 --> 07:29.911
Zac has asked me for anything.

07:32.399 --> 07:34.428
Please, Mr. Martin...

07:39.901 --> 07:41.216
Bring him home.

07:44.627 --> 07:46.438
And if he's already dead?

07:51.461 --> 07:53.665
Bring him home anyway.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.333
What's your connection?

07:59.373 --> 08:01.211
The father or the son?

08:02.373 --> 08:05.044
I dated Zac when I was stationed in Jordan.

08:05.059 --> 08:06.708
It was a long time ago.

08:06.745 --> 08:08.394
I'm sorry, I should've told you.

08:08.596 --> 08:09.726
Why didn't you?

08:09.744 --> 08:11.848
I didn't want you to feel obligated.

08:13.622 --> 08:15.525
Are you going to do it?

08:20.546 --> 08:23.143
I'm gonna need you with me.

08:56.216 --> 09:04.650
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

09:45.289 --> 09:47.271
Awfully quiet, isn't it?

09:48.250 --> 09:49.905
A ghost town.

10:29.325 --> 10:31.080
I counted 19 beds.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.386
Nineteen empty beds.

10:33.506 --> 10:35.819
Wherever they went, they left in a hurry.

10:40.465 --> 10:42.441
He was gone before the shooting started.

10:42.468 --> 10:43.659
How do you know?

10:43.779 --> 10:45.279
More bullet holes,

10:45.587 --> 10:47.389
and there's no blood here.

10:47.965 --> 10:51.085
What kind of a man shoots
through a closed door?

10:51.720 --> 10:53.591
The kind who shoots first and

10:53.622 --> 10:55.566
asks questions later.

10:58.660 --> 11:00.261
There's Zac.

11:06.926 --> 11:08.115
You OK?

11:09.359 --> 11:10.621
I'm OK.

11:27.021 --> 11:28.264
Tell me more.

11:28.292 --> 11:30.390
- About?
- Zac.

11:30.606 --> 11:33.094
If he's the package, I need his dimensions.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.865
Hard-charging.

11:35.911 --> 11:37.863
Can't sit still.

11:38.344 --> 11:40.481
Thinks he's the smartest
guy in the room and

11:40.502 --> 11:41.902
totally believes in his cause.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.386
Look.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.512
Bullet holes.

11:53.632 --> 11:55.932
Looks like it was forced off the road.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.699
Radiator took a hit.

12:24.669 --> 12:26.086
Frank!

12:29.827 --> 12:31.235
Hiding place?

12:33.285 --> 12:35.553
Maybe not a good one.

12:35.854 --> 12:38.360
If that was your friend,
he lost a lot of blood.

12:58.376 --> 13:00.585
FranÃ§ais? English?

13:01.212 --> 13:02.913
We're looking for a friend.

13:03.114 --> 13:05.277
He was hurt three nights ago.

13:07.551 --> 13:09.375
Put that away...

13:09.495 --> 13:11.076
and come with me.

13:13.199 --> 13:15.696
What the hell do you think you are doing?

13:16.610 --> 13:18.220
We told you.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.101
- We're looking for Zac Preston.
- My guess is he's dead.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.132
And you will be soon, if you don't leave.

13:23.159 --> 13:24.997
We found a bus that was shot up.

13:25.015 --> 13:27.036
Blood in the luggage compartment.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.603
- Did you treat him, Doctor?
- Zac was a friend.

13:30.631 --> 13:32.589
But Al-Harazi made it clear.

13:32.709 --> 13:35.232
He will kill anyone who helps him.

13:35.352 --> 13:36.951
Your friend gets shot

13:37.071 --> 13:38.607
and you send him away?

13:38.634 --> 13:40.509
This isn't about friendship.

13:40.629 --> 13:44.222
I am the only doctor for 100 kilometers.

13:44.342 --> 13:46.720
People need me alive.

13:47.590 --> 13:50.224
Now go. And don't come back!

13:52.762 --> 13:54.262
Heart-warming.

13:54.464 --> 13:56.754
At least we know where Zac isn't.

13:59.368 --> 14:01.272
Can I see that picture again?

14:04.440 --> 14:06.147
That's the same guy, isn't it?

14:06.175 --> 14:08.232
Standing next to Zac?

14:19.803 --> 14:21.266
Speak English?

14:22.529 --> 14:23.580
A little.

14:23.758 --> 14:25.090
What's your name?

14:25.913 --> 14:27.120
Ayoob.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.398
Ayoob, you called Zac's father.

14:29.416 --> 14:31.611
He sent us. We're here to get him.

14:34.886 --> 14:37.090
This isn't his grave, is it?

14:39.523 --> 14:41.032
It's a cousin's...

14:41.343 --> 14:44.197
killed by al-Hazari for helping Zac.

14:44.435 --> 14:47.087
Tell us where he is. Then we'll go.

14:51.166 --> 14:52.831
He says not to trust you.

14:52.858 --> 14:54.459
I know what he says.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.615
Take this to Zac.

14:57.735 --> 14:59.462
It'll prove I'm a friend.

15:07.144 --> 15:09.495
Sayed will take you to a safe place.

15:09.733 --> 15:11.301
You wait there.

15:11.699 --> 15:14.059
_

15:14.077 --> 15:15.796
_

15:25.820 --> 15:27.896
That was a good idea. The bracelet.

15:28.016 --> 15:29.653
A gift from Zac.

15:29.773 --> 15:31.345
He'll know it's me.

15:31.730 --> 15:34.364
_

15:34.409 --> 15:36.623
- _
- _

15:56.278 --> 15:58.070

- _
- _

16:07.930 --> 16:09.283
_

16:16.335 --> 16:18.900
This is harder than I thought.

16:20.268 --> 16:22.692
The truth is Zac and I were engaged.

16:23.039 --> 16:24.786
But I broke it off.

16:24.906 --> 16:27.237
And you're not sure
you did the right thing?

16:31.015 --> 16:32.113
What?

16:32.350 --> 16:34.060
I hear an engine.

16:43.967 --> 16:46.930
- _
- _

16:47.050 --> 16:48.412
I didn't see Zac or Ayoob.

16:48.439 --> 16:50.698
_

16:53.561 --> 16:55.417
We've been played.

17:23.516 --> 17:24.650
You...

17:25.546 --> 17:28.354
I don't know.

17:33.877 --> 17:35.579
So, what are you going to do?

17:36.200 --> 17:38.194
Shoot Zac in cold blood?

17:39.128 --> 17:40.461
Killing an aid worker

17:40.463 --> 17:42.192
will make you more famous
than you want to be.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.673
An aid worker?

17:44.251 --> 17:46.234
Is that what you think he is?

17:46.587 --> 17:48.255
Zac Preston is a thief.

17:48.292 --> 17:49.572
What did he steal?

17:51.024 --> 17:52.524
It doesn't matter.

17:52.746 --> 17:54.760
What matters is that it was mine.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.455
_

18:24.848 --> 18:27.162
_

18:36.315 --> 18:37.532
Zac!

18:37.925 --> 18:40.019
- Get in. I'll drive.
- No!

18:40.039 --> 18:42.059
Zac, let him drive!

18:55.148 --> 18:57.114
Why did my father send you?

18:57.234 --> 18:59.044
Why do you think?

19:00.224 --> 19:02.108
I told him to send help,

19:02.127 --> 19:03.956
not you and your boyfriend.

19:04.432 --> 19:05.922
He's saving your life, Zac.

19:05.950 --> 19:07.211
Is that what you call it?

19:07.212 --> 19:09.306
He practically served me
up to Al-Harazi on a plate,

19:09.306 --> 19:10.221
and Ayoob is dead.

19:10.258 --> 19:11.574
His friend betrayed all of us.

19:11.593 --> 19:13.953
It doesn't change it!

19:14.073 --> 19:16.287
You've only made things
worse. Where are you taking me?

19:16.407 --> 19:17.831
Across the border. To Morocco.

19:17.858 --> 19:19.386
I have to make a stop first.

19:19.506 --> 19:20.710
What for?

19:20.978 --> 19:22.779
Does it matter? You work for me.

19:25.524 --> 19:26.483
Frank?

19:26.529 --> 19:27.773
What are you doing?

19:31.021 --> 19:32.767
It's your call.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.709
Where is this stop?

19:38.829 --> 19:40.871
It's 20 minutes that way.

19:42.343 --> 19:44.639
You're a pain in the ass, you know that?

19:46.514 --> 19:47.859
I know.

20:28.711 --> 20:30.928
This is where you went hiding?

20:30.973 --> 20:33.672
The Bedouins have no love for Al-Harazi.

20:33.792 --> 20:36.416
The enemy of my enemy is my friend...

20:36.636 --> 20:39.298
Yeah, that and payback for some radios

20:39.326 --> 20:40.743
I funnelled them a few months ago.

20:40.863 --> 20:42.454
Smart investment.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.124
One of the few worthwhile
things I learned from my father.

20:45.124 --> 20:46.487
Just this way...

20:59.374 --> 21:01.002
You gone long time.

21:01.041 --> 21:03.554
"You were gone a long time."

21:05.265 --> 21:06.728
This is Ali.

21:06.746 --> 21:07.795
My right hand.

21:07.915 --> 21:09.820
I see. And Ali's coming with us?

21:09.856 --> 21:10.954
No.

21:11.182 --> 21:12.262
They all are.

21:15.711 --> 21:18.355
- Nineteen boys.
- Is that a problem?

21:18.382 --> 21:20.120
Getting them past al-Hazari?

21:21.071 --> 21:24.044
That's more than a problem.
It's practically impossible.

21:29.807 --> 21:31.920
I understand the difficulty.

21:32.171 --> 21:33.328
I do.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.807
But if I leave these boys behind,

21:35.835 --> 21:37.600
he will kill each and every one of them,

21:37.609 --> 21:38.990
just to punish me.

21:39.713 --> 21:41.798
I can't let that happen.

21:43.015 --> 21:44.871
You can't.

21:58.352 --> 21:59.931
What are we going to do?

22:00.333 --> 22:03.090
I have no bloody idea.

22:04.570 --> 22:07.013
I don't know what to say, I'm...

22:08.206 --> 22:09.419
Sorry.

22:10.643 --> 22:12.172
You didn't know this would happen.

22:12.209 --> 22:13.334
I should have.

22:14.547 --> 22:17.139
The job has spun out of control.

22:18.516 --> 22:21.163
And I know you only took it because of me.

22:31.462 --> 22:33.400
- How do that?
- Do what?

22:33.520 --> 22:34.698
Ali...

22:34.818 --> 22:37.682
My father sent Frank and
Cat to get us out of here.

22:37.802 --> 22:39.263
You're gonna help them.

22:39.281 --> 22:40.964
This is all he send?

22:41.706 --> 22:42.729
Yeah.

22:42.730 --> 22:44.477
We screwed.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.050
I like this kid.

22:46.736 --> 22:48.131
You know what a map is?

22:48.332 --> 22:49.672
I'm gonna need one.

22:55.077 --> 22:57.684
- You don't look well.
- I'm alright.

22:58.150 --> 22:59.888
How did you get that?

23:01.059 --> 23:03.437
They shot at the bus to stop it.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.138
If they'd checked the luggage compartment,

23:05.181 --> 23:06.784
I'd be dead right now.

23:07.717 --> 23:09.931
I'm impressed you got the boys away.

23:11.833 --> 23:13.342
Ayoob did,

23:13.717 --> 23:15.547
with help from the Bedouins.

23:16.041 --> 23:18.126
Al-Harazi said he'd
kill one of them each day

23:18.161 --> 23:19.694
unless I surrendered.

23:20.074 --> 23:21.830
He told us you're a thief.

23:22.265 --> 23:23.579
He would say that.

23:23.699 --> 23:25.114
What do you mean?

23:26.788 --> 23:28.919
When I came here two years ago,

23:28.937 --> 23:30.822
al-Harazi was happy.

23:31.727 --> 23:34.617
Not because I provided shelter
for two dozen homeless boys,

23:34.626 --> 23:36.025
but because it meant aid

23:36.044 --> 23:37.579
flowing to Zouerat.

23:37.937 --> 23:40.581
Aid he could skim and sell off.

23:40.837 --> 23:43.233
That's part of the game. You know that.

23:44.552 --> 23:46.426
He's a parasite,

23:47.011 --> 23:48.877
making money off other people's money,

23:48.891 --> 23:50.405
he's like my father.

23:50.624 --> 23:53.195
He got greedy and my kids got hungry.

23:53.441 --> 23:56.495
Please tell me you didn't
steal food back from him?

23:56.541 --> 23:57.931
Some of it.

23:58.299 --> 23:59.633
What else could I do?

23:59.753 --> 24:01.928
You put their lives at risk, Zac.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.740
This is happening because of you.

24:07.481 --> 24:09.767
It's because of me they're alive at all.

24:10.910 --> 24:13.590
It's because of you that
they're gonna to stay that way.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.523
Excuse me.

24:27.657 --> 24:29.228
Frank!

24:33.934 --> 24:35.331
Let's get him inside.

24:36.804 --> 24:38.218
It's infected.

24:38.514 --> 24:39.586
How bad?

24:39.940 --> 24:41.212
Bad.

24:42.910 --> 24:44.989
He may have blood poisoning.

24:46.361 --> 24:49.681
Stupid man, he takes care
of everybody but himself.

24:50.220 --> 24:52.632
I'm OK. I'm fine.

24:55.888 --> 24:57.656
He's not going anywhere.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.364
It's 10 kilometers to the Moroccan border

25:06.401 --> 25:07.901
if we take this road.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.523
You know that border is disputed?

25:11.643 --> 25:14.011
Separated by two
kilometers of no man's land,

25:14.020 --> 25:16.422
littered with land mines
to discourage refugees.

25:16.443 --> 25:18.337
I'm hoping we can use
that to our advantage.

25:18.457 --> 25:21.036
Even if you can, how do you
fit 19 kids on that truck?

25:21.156 --> 25:23.681
I know where there is bus,
big enough for everyone.

25:23.949 --> 25:25.628
Yes Ali, we know your bus.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.318
It's got a shot radiator.

25:27.438 --> 25:29.969
I could probably fix it
with a hose from the truck.

25:30.089 --> 25:32.341
See? We already work together.

25:32.387 --> 25:33.539
What about Zac?

25:34.793 --> 25:36.630
He won't make it without medicine.

25:38.030 --> 25:40.251
Clinic in Zouaret. It has medicine.

25:40.371 --> 25:41.523
That doctor won't help.

25:41.533 --> 25:43.266
- Then I steal.
- You steal?

25:43.279 --> 25:45.080
I'm not scared. I'm a sneaky bastard.

25:45.117 --> 25:46.617
That's what Zac says.

25:48.272 --> 25:50.010
OK, but it sounds pretty risky,

25:50.037 --> 25:51.308
even for a sneaky bastard.

25:51.354 --> 25:52.209
I'll go.

25:52.443 --> 25:53.851
Look at your face.

25:53.971 --> 25:55.250
Look at my face.

25:55.370 --> 25:58.625
Which face has a better chance
not getting killed in Zouaret?

26:01.753 --> 26:04.570
Seems like you're a
persuasive bastard, too.

26:05.539 --> 26:06.504
OK,

26:06.624 --> 26:08.127
then you look through the boxes

26:08.158 --> 26:09.273
and take anything

26:09.393 --> 26:11.630
that ends with "illin."

26:13.715 --> 26:14.785
OK?

26:14.822 --> 26:15.865
Ampicillin...

26:15.901 --> 26:17.090
Oxicillin...

26:17.210 --> 26:18.188
Got it ?

26:18.947 --> 26:20.630
And take syringes,

26:20.630 --> 26:22.002
needles, for shots.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.538
I don't like needles.

26:23.575 --> 26:25.374
Neither do I, tough guy.

26:25.742 --> 26:27.517
Can you get the Bedouins to help take Zac

26:27.518 --> 26:28.743
and the boys to the bus?

26:28.863 --> 26:29.912
We'll meet you there.

26:30.313 --> 26:31.991
We really shouldn't move him.

26:32.282 --> 26:33.966
We don't have a choice.

26:48.692 --> 26:49.881
Your friend,

26:49.899 --> 26:51.555
Zac like her.

26:52.935 --> 26:54.883
- You think?
- Too much.

26:55.917 --> 26:57.234
He go with her,

26:57.279 --> 26:58.798
he not stay with us.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.890
How did you meet Zac?

27:03.079 --> 27:04.745
He caught me stealing shoes.

27:04.947 --> 27:06.710
I think he going to hit me.

27:06.830 --> 27:09.005
Instead he give me job at school.

27:10.453 --> 27:12.079
Why were you stealing shoes?

27:12.199 --> 27:13.780
Shoes bring money.

27:13.822 --> 27:15.326
I was hungry.

27:15.363 --> 27:17.713
- Where are your parents?
- Dead.

27:18.694 --> 27:20.366
That's why I come Zouaret.

27:21.029 --> 27:23.109
Zac give me home...

27:23.886 --> 27:24.846
Help...

27:24.966 --> 27:26.210
Not just me.

27:26.330 --> 27:27.755
All people.

27:28.169 --> 27:30.099
We call him Melak Zouaret.

27:30.105 --> 27:31.771
You know what is "melak"?

27:32.932 --> 27:34.039
Angel.

27:35.383 --> 27:37.633
Zac Angel of Zouaret.

27:41.100 --> 27:42.527
Maybe you...

27:42.867 --> 27:44.228
melak too.

27:44.969 --> 27:47.274
Sorry, Ali. I'm nobody's angel.

27:55.523 --> 27:56.779
Where are we going?

27:56.980 --> 27:58.176
To the bus.

27:58.752 --> 28:01.998
- I can't, not without the kids.
- They're coming.

28:04.019 --> 28:04.868
Wait.

28:04.988 --> 28:05.788
What?

28:05.908 --> 28:07.312
Your bracelet...

28:07.432 --> 28:09.049
Should be in your pocket.

28:12.570 --> 28:13.960
I still don't understand

28:13.997 --> 28:15.872
how you got mixed up in all this, Cat.

28:15.992 --> 28:17.700
Your father called for advice.

28:17.729 --> 28:19.068
As it happens,

28:19.188 --> 28:20.893
I work for Frank now.

28:21.588 --> 28:23.161
He's good, huh?

28:24.359 --> 28:26.052
He's the best.

28:31.055 --> 28:33.808
We work together. That's all.

28:37.531 --> 28:38.976
- Are you OK?
- Yeah...

28:38.988 --> 28:40.567
I'm fine.

28:42.734 --> 28:45.625
You know I still care about you, Cat.

28:46.823 --> 28:48.597
Don't start this, Zac

28:48.615 --> 28:50.362
You kept the bracelet all these years.

28:50.398 --> 28:51.844
It must've meant something.

28:53.621 --> 28:55.439
It means I like jewelry.

29:00.008 --> 29:01.292
Where's Ali?

29:01.337 --> 29:04.245
He's with Frank. They went
to steal you some antibiotics.

29:04.546 --> 29:05.545
No.

29:05.880 --> 29:06.797
What?

29:06.834 --> 29:09.239
He told you he's a
sneaky bastard, didn't he?

29:11.334 --> 29:13.996
He's the worst thief on the planet.

29:24.198 --> 29:25.694
Here, take this.

29:30.294 --> 29:33.633
You get in trouble, you
shout as loud as you can, OK?

31:41.177 --> 31:42.777
_

32:14.791 --> 32:16.419
_

32:16.431 --> 32:18.861
Not so sneaky, Ali.

32:24.248 --> 32:26.498
_

32:26.507 --> 32:27.833
_

32:27.861 --> 32:29.690
_

32:29.810 --> 32:32.013
- Pardon me.
- _

32:32.013 --> 32:34.126
Pick on someone your own size.

32:42.390 --> 32:44.324
Where is the kafir?

32:52.599 --> 32:54.367
You're a funny guy, huh?

32:54.605 --> 32:56.800
You want to die for your friend?

32:57.371 --> 32:58.986
He's not my friend.

33:00.129 --> 33:01.174
So...

33:01.375 --> 33:03.467
this is a rescue mission?

33:04.437 --> 33:06.623
You should have brought more men.

33:07.046 --> 33:09.539
I get that a lot.

33:09.548 --> 33:10.984
Stop!

33:19.125 --> 33:20.760
You were a soldier,

33:21.094 --> 33:22.792
I can tell.

33:23.973 --> 33:26.387
Your training made you hard to break.

33:28.401 --> 33:30.476
Let's see how hard.

33:38.377 --> 33:39.796
At three,

33:40.012 --> 33:41.817
I cut his throat.

33:43.326 --> 33:44.607
One...

33:45.250 --> 33:46.482
Don't say!

33:46.718 --> 33:47.735
Two!

33:50.616 --> 33:51.723
Don't!

33:52.080 --> 33:54.375
He's at the oasis with the other boys.

33:54.385 --> 33:55.409
No!

33:58.397 --> 34:00.659
See, it wasn't so hard.

34:12.877 --> 34:14.268
Run!

34:40.328 --> 34:41.882
We're locked in!

34:44.806 --> 34:46.054
Push!

35:10.557 --> 35:13.355
You are sneaky bastard too!

35:37.492 --> 35:38.516
You OK?

35:40.129 --> 35:41.626
I've been better.

35:42.731 --> 35:44.589
Give Cat the medicine.

35:46.062 --> 35:47.452
Good boy!

36:00.404 --> 36:01.410
Ouch.

36:01.530 --> 36:02.417
Wimp!

36:02.955 --> 36:04.181
Are you OK?

36:04.502 --> 36:07.063
He will be. Thanks to you.

36:08.078 --> 36:09.487
Thanks, kid.

36:10.447 --> 36:11.947
Whatevs.

36:13.501 --> 36:14.828
Frank?

36:15.870 --> 36:17.645
Time to go.

36:44.434 --> 36:45.979
Thank you, Frank...

36:46.391 --> 36:48.449
for getting us this far.

36:48.569 --> 36:50.983
You can thank Ali, he's quite a boy.

36:51.202 --> 36:52.519
Yeah, he is.

36:59.232 --> 37:01.446
You and Cat are good together...

37:05.735 --> 37:07.213
What is it?

37:07.537 --> 37:09.256
Al-Harazi.

37:20.533 --> 37:22.060
You can't outrun them.

37:22.180 --> 37:24.496
The thought has occurred to me.

37:27.019 --> 37:28.408
Everybody, get down!

37:35.999 --> 37:37.398
The border!

37:37.518 --> 37:38.652
I see it.

37:38.862 --> 37:40.591
Tell the boys to grab onto something.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.101
Grab onto something!

38:21.511 --> 38:23.524
That say danger!

38:23.546 --> 38:25.002
The mines. We're safe.

38:25.046 --> 38:27.000
As long as we stay on the road.

38:44.284 --> 38:46.179
We can't have that, can we?

39:05.826 --> 39:07.282
You the man!

39:07.590 --> 39:10.268
Never had an audience before.

39:13.158 --> 39:14.995
Al-Harazi's still behind us!

39:16.246 --> 39:18.559
He's not going away. Not without some help.

39:19.803 --> 39:21.611
Here, take the wheel.

39:21.644 --> 39:22.657
Me?

39:23.111 --> 39:24.025
Yeah.

39:25.452 --> 39:26.879
Just drive fast.

39:30.337 --> 39:31.994
You stay up front.

39:32.418 --> 39:34.328
I help, you'll see.

39:47.644 --> 39:48.910
Get me some cloths...

39:49.298 --> 39:51.266
Rags, anything.

39:54.642 --> 39:55.664
Frank.

40:11.029 --> 40:12.427
Like this.

40:16.797 --> 40:17.996
You OK?

40:48.733 --> 40:50.709
We're here!

41:05.781 --> 41:07.801
The bastard doesn't give up.

41:15.487 --> 41:16.654
Get down!

41:30.601 --> 41:32.627
Hold on to something!

42:04.267 --> 42:05.627
You are good.

42:09.533 --> 42:10.646
C'mon.

42:14.715 --> 42:17.422
_

42:47.333 --> 42:48.804
Where's Zac?

42:59.325 --> 43:01.723
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for something.

43:03.379 --> 43:04.425
Got it?

43:04.727 --> 43:06.394
- Cat's bracelet.
- C'mon.

43:18.365 --> 43:20.165
- Frank!
- Stop!

43:22.295 --> 43:23.443
Go.

43:23.663 --> 43:25.741
Not without the package. That's you.

43:26.514 --> 43:28.119
Ali come back!

43:29.143 --> 43:31.287
Ali! Ali!

43:31.725 --> 43:34.111
_

43:34.154 --> 43:36.445
_

43:58.651 --> 44:01.139
I think we found the Angel of Zouaret.

44:04.936 --> 44:07.322
_

44:11.316 --> 44:13.585
_

44:58.536 --> 45:00.004
Do you want drink?

45:00.124 --> 45:02.499
"Do you want a drink?"

45:06.005 --> 45:07.007
Sure, kid.

45:07.051 --> 45:08.302
Give it here.

45:13.217 --> 45:14.651
I got us a car.

45:15.121 --> 45:16.884
There's a jet waiting in Ouarzazate.

45:17.213 --> 45:18.333
Thank you,

45:18.923 --> 45:20.572
but these boys still need me.

45:23.580 --> 45:25.834
You didn't think I'd
actually leave, did you?

45:28.848 --> 45:30.333
No, not really.

45:30.453 --> 45:32.104
You got me across the border, Frank.

45:32.119 --> 45:34.050
I'll make sure my father pays you.

45:34.270 --> 45:36.216
Well, I can't say it's been a pleasure...

45:38.642 --> 45:40.400
I'll see you around, Mr. Martin.

45:42.962 --> 45:45.362
Why don't you show me what
you can do with that ball?

45:51.721 --> 45:52.979
This is the part where you tell me

45:53.008 --> 45:54.450
what a terrible mistake that you made.

45:54.570 --> 45:55.690
Zac...

45:56.389 --> 45:58.738
You risked your life,
came all the way here.

45:58.761 --> 46:00.428
Why do that if you don't still love me?

46:03.523 --> 46:06.209
Because the world's a
better place with you in it.

46:09.604 --> 46:10.614
Hey...

46:12.575 --> 46:14.141
You're gonna want this back.

46:17.740 --> 46:18.903
You keep it.

46:20.650 --> 46:22.511
I don't need it anymore.
