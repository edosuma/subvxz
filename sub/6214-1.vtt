00:13.568 --> 00:15.365
Okay, I don't know
what happened here,

00:15.537 --> 00:18.563
but 100 bucks says
I get blamed for it.

00:18.740 --> 00:23.336
Sabrina, before I go,
I just wanted to say...

00:23.512 --> 00:24.536
Salem.

00:24.713 --> 00:27.147
Where is my bookie
when I need him?

00:29.818 --> 00:31.718
Wait a minute.

00:31.887 --> 00:34.412
This looks like Sabrina's mouth.

00:35.257 --> 00:38.454
These are her eyes
and this looks like her...

00:38.627 --> 00:39.889
Sorry, Sabrina.

00:40.061 --> 00:43.963
Well, don't just stand there, lug nut,
sweep her up.

00:47.269 --> 00:48.497
Whoa.

00:48.670 --> 00:50.137
Sabrina, are you okay?

00:50.305 --> 00:51.829
Yeah, I'm fine,

00:52.007 --> 00:53.975
except that you were standing
on my tongue.

00:54.142 --> 00:56.667
- How did I get put back together?
I did it.

00:56.845 --> 00:57.869
Aunt Zelda?

00:58.814 --> 01:00.475
You gave up your adult years
for me?

01:01.183 --> 01:02.514
That is so generous

01:02.684 --> 01:04.617
and a very crafty way
to get rid of wrinkles.

01:04.786 --> 01:08.483
I know it might be a little strange
having an 8-year-old to look after you.

01:08.657 --> 01:10.420
You don't have to
look after me anymore.

01:10.592 --> 01:12.924
You and Aunt Hilda have taught me
everything I need to know.

01:13.094 --> 01:16.029
Now, I need to prove that I can get by
without relying on you guys.

01:16.198 --> 01:17.324
I'm gonna be graduating soon.

01:17.499 --> 01:19.399
I'm gonna be looking for a new job
as a reporter.

01:19.568 --> 01:22.537
So you don't have to take care
of anyone anymore.

02:01.476 --> 02:02.670
We've got to do something.

02:02.844 --> 02:05.506
Three months living in this house
and we still run out of hot water.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.375
I don't know
what you are talking about.

02:07.549 --> 02:10.916
I take a two-hour shower
every morning and it never runs out.

02:11.086 --> 02:13.020
- Is that the mail? Can I have it?
- Excuse me.

02:13.188 --> 02:16.885
You are not the only "occupant" here.

02:19.694 --> 02:21.924
I can't believe I haven't gotten
a response to my résumé.

02:22.097 --> 02:24.065
Sabrina, you gotta use connections.

02:24.232 --> 02:26.166
I don't know
why you don't take me up on my offer.

02:26.334 --> 02:28.393
<i>I mean, my friend does write
for The Village Voice.</i>

02:28.570 --> 02:31.061
He writes letters to the editor.
He's a crackpot.

02:31.239 --> 02:33.173
A published crackpot.

02:33.341 --> 02:36.708
Oh, my God, I won.
I won the MTVcontest.

02:36.878 --> 02:37.970
What contest?

02:38.146 --> 02:40.706
Uh, it's some writing contest
where you...

02:40.882 --> 02:43.851
<i>- Oh, it's MTV. Who cares?
- Wow.</i>

02:44.019 --> 02:45.509
"Based on the essay
that you submitted,

02:45.687 --> 02:49.054
<i>you have been selected to interview
a rock band for Scorch magazine. "</i>

02:49.224 --> 02:53.285
Oh, maybe it'll be the Rolling Stones.
My nana will be so tickled, ha, ha.

02:53.461 --> 02:55.622
Great, you bust your butt
trying to get a reporting job,

02:55.797 --> 02:58.891
she gets one by submitting
a 3-by-5 card listing her turn-ons.

02:59.067 --> 03:01.001
Hey, that's the way it goes.
I'm happy for her.

03:01.169 --> 03:04.502
<i>It says I'm supposed to go
to Scorch magazine for the details.</i>

03:04.673 --> 03:05.697
<i>I'm out of it. Scorch?</i>

03:05.874 --> 03:09.310
What's that? Some kind of
trade publication for pyromaniacs?

03:09.477 --> 03:12.071
It's only, like,
the coolest magazine ever.

03:12.647 --> 03:15.309
If it weren't for them,
I wouldn't know what music I like.

03:15.483 --> 03:16.507
Sabrina, get dressed.

03:16.685 --> 03:19.017
- Why?
- Well, you have to come with me.

03:19.187 --> 03:22.850
I mean, you can do
all that face-to-face stuff.

03:23.024 --> 03:25.458
What I do is write.

03:25.627 --> 03:28.596
And what I'm thinking of doing
is so wrong.

03:40.141 --> 03:43.338
Wow. Everybody here is so young.

03:44.212 --> 03:46.476
And they all look so...

03:46.648 --> 03:47.774
What's the word?

03:47.949 --> 03:49.246
Tragically hip?

03:49.417 --> 03:50.884
Uh, that's two words.

03:53.421 --> 03:54.649
Um, excuse me. Hi.

03:54.823 --> 03:57.087
My friend is here to find out
about some contest she won.

03:57.258 --> 04:01.251
She's supposed to talk
to a senior editor, Annie Martos?

04:01.429 --> 04:03.226
Yeah, that's me.
Why are you speaking for her?

04:03.398 --> 04:07.164
Uh, where's the little girl's room?
I kind of have to tinkle.

04:07.335 --> 04:09.064
I get it. Come with me.

04:09.237 --> 04:10.431
We'll go over the details.

04:15.877 --> 04:17.071
You here for the contest?

04:17.245 --> 04:19.076
Oh, no, my friend won the contest.

04:19.247 --> 04:21.442
I'm just along for moral support.

04:21.616 --> 04:22.708
Period. Close quote.

04:24.486 --> 04:26.215
She punctuates when she talks.

04:26.388 --> 04:28.185
No, I know this is
none of my business,

04:28.356 --> 04:30.756
but the quotes
go on the outside of the period.

04:30.925 --> 04:32.552
Damn, that's gutsy.

04:32.727 --> 04:33.819
Exclamation point.

04:35.397 --> 04:37.797
Sorry, force of habit. I'm a writer too.

04:37.966 --> 04:40.628
Well, not this kind of stuff.
Serious journalism.

04:41.136 --> 04:43.934
Oh, and, uh, this isn't
serious journalism?

04:44.105 --> 04:46.665
Kandinsky Vodka
just gave us four free cases.

04:46.841 --> 04:48.172
It's gonna be a early day, people.

04:50.078 --> 04:52.546
Our advertisers
love to give me the freebies.

04:52.714 --> 04:55.046
Hi, I'm Leonard.
Want a case of vodka?

04:55.216 --> 04:57.377
- No, thanks.
- No problem.

04:57.552 --> 04:58.883
- Wanna go out for eggs?
- Len.

04:59.054 --> 05:00.885
Too much. I know.

05:01.056 --> 05:02.785
Sabrina.

05:02.957 --> 05:05.357
I get to go New York and
interview that band, Course of Nature

05:05.527 --> 05:07.586
and write
a 1,200-word article about it.

05:07.762 --> 05:10.230
You're kidding.
Do you even know 1,200 words?

05:10.398 --> 05:12.628
Plus, I get to bring two friends.

05:12.801 --> 05:14.325
I doubt this friend will wanna go.

05:14.502 --> 05:16.936
It doesn't sound like, uh,
serious journalism.

05:17.105 --> 05:19.403
<i>You'd pass up a trip to MTV?</i>

05:21.009 --> 05:23.136
No, no. I'll go.

05:23.311 --> 05:27.270
<i>But only because I have a very solid
connection at the Village Voice.</i>

05:28.183 --> 05:30.515
I'm just following up
on the reporter job.

05:30.685 --> 05:32.482
Yeah, but you got my résumé, right?

05:32.654 --> 05:36.351
What does it matter if I don't know
how to surf. I'm a writer, not a surfer.

05:36.524 --> 05:38.151
Fine. Unh.

05:38.326 --> 05:41.489
<i>Well, scratch off
True Surfer Stories Monthly.</i>

05:41.663 --> 05:45.292
Wow, you've been working the phones
non-stop for the past 24 hours.

05:45.467 --> 05:48.368
I gotta get a job as a reporter, even
if I have to go as far as New York.

05:48.536 --> 05:50.163
Why do you have to go
to New York?

05:50.338 --> 05:52.431
<i>You've already got an offer
from The Boston Globe.</i>

05:52.607 --> 05:53.938
Yeah, three days a week

05:54.109 --> 05:56.270
as an assistant associate
to the associate assistant.

05:56.444 --> 05:58.173
I think I'm a little beyond that.

05:58.346 --> 05:59.608
Well, you better get something,

05:59.781 --> 06:03.308
or I won't be the only one in this house
that's eating cat food.

06:06.254 --> 06:07.585
<i>Herald Examiner,
Fleming speaking.</i>

06:07.756 --> 06:09.018
Hi, my name is Sabrina Spellman,

06:09.190 --> 06:10.714
calling to follow up
about my résumé.

06:10.892 --> 06:14.521
Yeah, yeah, it's either in a file drawer
or in a pile. I'll get to it when I get to it.

06:14.696 --> 06:15.720
<i>But...
- Hold on.</i>

06:17.298 --> 06:18.390
Hello.

06:18.566 --> 06:20.466
Okay, well, I can either sit here
on hold all day

06:20.635 --> 06:23.035
or I can make something happen.

06:23.638 --> 06:25.868
You sent me a fax?

06:26.040 --> 06:29.441
I don't know,
I can't find anything around here.

06:29.611 --> 06:32.842
<i>Get my résumé out of the file
And put it right on top of the pile</i>

06:33.782 --> 06:36.717
I don't know where it is.
Why don't you fax me another one?

06:36.885 --> 06:39.820
Uh, better yet, just bring it over.

06:40.388 --> 06:42.549
Yeah, uh, who am I talking to again?

06:42.724 --> 06:44.555
Oh, yeah. Uh...

06:44.726 --> 06:47.752
Oh, how about that? It's right on top.

06:47.929 --> 06:50.898
Well, I can squeeze one more in
tomorrow, all right? 1:00.

06:53.835 --> 06:56.497
This is so exciting.

06:57.305 --> 06:58.966
Hello, New York.

06:59.140 --> 07:03.008
Be careful, Morgan.
New Yorkers love a moving target.

07:03.411 --> 07:05.606
Hm-mm.
I would have come out earlier,

07:05.780 --> 07:07.577
but I was stuck to a jawbreaker.

07:07.749 --> 07:09.307
Hey, remember our deal.

07:09.484 --> 07:11.179
I bring you to New York,
you don't whine,

07:11.352 --> 07:12.876
complain or talk in front of people.

07:13.054 --> 07:16.217
Don't worry, while you gals
are on your little MTVjunket,

07:16.391 --> 07:17.688
I'm gonna take in the sights.

07:17.859 --> 07:19.053
<i>I'm not going to MTV.</i>

07:19.227 --> 07:21.092
<i>I have that interview
at the Herald Examiner.</i>

07:21.262 --> 07:23.924
I really need this job and
I'm not leaving until they give it to me.

07:24.098 --> 07:25.122
Mm.

07:25.300 --> 07:28.736
The new Sabrina is feisty. Me likey.

07:29.871 --> 07:32.704
It's just part of a hot dog.
It's their way of saying welcome.

07:32.874 --> 07:35.138
Well, they can throw
whatever they want.

07:35.310 --> 07:37.278
<i>They can't stop me
from going on MTV.</i>

07:37.445 --> 07:39.310
<i>Me neither.
I can't wait to go on TRL.</i>

07:39.480 --> 07:42.108
<i>You? You don't seem like
a Total Request Live kind of person.</i>

07:42.550 --> 07:43.574
Of course not,

07:43.751 --> 07:46.743
but I'll blend in with all the desperate,
squealing teenyboppers,

07:46.921 --> 07:48.081
cozy up to Carson Daly,

07:48.256 --> 07:51.020
and as soon as I'm on camera,
demand that people stop eating meat.

07:51.192 --> 07:53.092
<i>I'm not sure TRL
is the place for a protest.</i>

07:53.261 --> 07:55.422
I mean, it's not like it's the Oscars.

07:55.597 --> 07:58.623
Oh, sir, can you pull over here?
All right, I'll meet you guys later.

07:58.800 --> 07:59.994
Oh, no, no, no.

08:00.168 --> 08:01.692
You have to help me
with the interview.

08:01.870 --> 08:05.670
<i>Morgan, my Herald Examiner
meeting is in 47 minutes.</i>

08:05.840 --> 08:07.899
I have to prepare to be spontaneous.
You'll be fine.

08:08.076 --> 08:10.271
I don't know how to do an interview.
I can't write.

08:10.445 --> 08:12.811
I stole a writing sample of yours
for the contest.

08:14.048 --> 08:15.447
You did what?

08:15.617 --> 08:18.780
Morgan, what a lousy thing to do.
You totally used Sabrina.

08:19.220 --> 08:21.120
My writing sample won?

08:21.289 --> 08:22.654
Wow.

08:23.558 --> 08:25.958
<i>To MTV. And step on it.</i>

08:34.001 --> 08:36.095
You won the contest,
you meet the band.

08:36.270 --> 08:38.135
You two meet the street.

08:38.740 --> 08:40.866
But they have to go in.

08:41.042 --> 08:42.873
Yeah, we're interpreters.

08:43.410 --> 08:46.346
Uh, one of the band members
is French and the other is German.

08:46.514 --> 08:48.311
<i>N'est pas, Mein Kampf?</i>

08:49.484 --> 08:52.510
Nice try.
You'll have to wait in the lobby.

08:58.893 --> 09:01.054
My tooth.

09:01.229 --> 09:03.754
Well, uh, at least now he has
something he wants for Christmas.

09:08.436 --> 09:11.803
- Oh, hi, hi, we're here from...
- Yeah, can you give us just a sec?

09:11.973 --> 09:14.441
We've gotta finish
working out this one part.

09:20.548 --> 09:23.381
<i>What if I missed you?</i>

09:23.551 --> 09:28.887
<i>You got caught in the sun</i>

09:32.460 --> 09:35.293
<i>What if I did something?</i>

09:35.463 --> 09:40.958
<i>Never to be undone</i>

09:49.110 --> 09:51.237
Do you guys know,
"Oops! I Did It Again"?

09:51.412 --> 09:53.846
Uh, why don't you jump in
with the interview questions?

09:54.015 --> 09:55.209
I just did.

09:55.383 --> 09:57.544
Ask him, uh,
what his influences are.

09:57.719 --> 10:03.919
So who influenced you
to cut your hair so short?

10:04.525 --> 10:07.323
Oh, uh, what distinguishes
Course of Nature from other bands?

10:07.495 --> 10:10.259
Well, for one thing,
we're not conventional.

10:10.431 --> 10:13.594
Don't play conventions.

10:13.768 --> 10:16.259
No, I mean,
we don't do the usual rock-band thing.

10:16.437 --> 10:19.770
Um, partying all night, getting wasted.
I don't even drink.

10:19.941 --> 10:22.876
Well, now with all those piercings,
you'd leak. Ha, ha.

10:24.679 --> 10:27.409
- I think she's gonna be just fine.
- Don't leave me.

10:27.582 --> 10:29.573
<i>I have to get to my interview
at the Herald Examiner</i>

10:29.751 --> 10:31.742
before my dream job
gets taken by somebody else.

10:31.919 --> 10:33.443
Just ask whatever comes
into your head.

10:36.824 --> 10:38.917
This could take a while.

10:41.796 --> 10:43.354
Oh, I've got one.

10:43.531 --> 10:46.125
Who here doesn't have a girlfriend?

10:48.403 --> 10:51.099
All right, there you have your little
favorite Canadian Avril Lavigne

10:51.272 --> 10:53.137
and "Sk8er Boi" at number three.

10:53.307 --> 10:54.934
Avril Lavigne no stranger
to the top ten.

10:55.109 --> 10:56.804
Roxie, I'm gonna be late
for my interview.

10:56.978 --> 10:59.310
But I need your help
and so do a million cows.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.742
Now, when we get next to Carson,

11:00.915 --> 11:03.110
I'll show my shirt
and then you show yours.

11:03.284 --> 11:05.650
Ugh. Can't I just wear one that says
"I'm with stupid"?

11:05.820 --> 11:08.618
Anybody wanna give a shoutout?
Anybody?

11:08.790 --> 11:10.985
Back here?
How about you, right over here?

11:11.159 --> 11:13.024
Who do you wanna give
a shout out to?

11:13.461 --> 11:15.326
Carson Daly.

11:15.496 --> 11:17.464
Ha, ha, that's me.
But who do you wanna...?

11:17.632 --> 11:20.430
What's this all about? It says "Meat. "
That's no way to refer yourself.

11:20.601 --> 11:21.625
Oh, no, no, no. Um...

11:21.803 --> 11:23.395
She has a message
she wants to get out.

11:23.571 --> 11:25.266
- Right, Roxie?
- Okay, what is that?

11:25.440 --> 11:26.839
Carson Daly.

11:27.008 --> 11:28.373
- The message?
- What's this say?

11:28.543 --> 11:29.874
"Kills meat. "

11:30.044 --> 11:33.775
You guys are a member
of the Ted Nugent fan club?

11:35.316 --> 11:36.783
Anything?

11:36.951 --> 11:39.511
Anybody want to give a shoutout
that's not on medication?

11:39.687 --> 11:41.018
How about you over here?

11:41.189 --> 11:43.316
Oh, Roxie, I'm sorry
the message got all messed up.

11:43.491 --> 11:46.619
<i>I can't believe how hot he is
and how great it is to be on TRL.</i>

11:48.763 --> 11:50.663
Oh, way to fight the power, Roxie.

11:50.832 --> 11:52.493
Oh, no, my interview.

11:52.667 --> 11:55.192
Must have taken a wrong turn.

11:55.369 --> 11:56.393
Whoa.

11:56.571 --> 11:59.335
If this is Hell's Kitchen,
I'd hate to see the bathroom.

12:01.042 --> 12:03.306
Okay, that is one big rat.

12:04.946 --> 12:07.107
Hey, hi, uh, what's up, bro?

12:07.281 --> 12:09.442
How about those teeth?
A little bleach will help that.

12:14.388 --> 12:15.650
Sorry, I'm late.

12:15.823 --> 12:18.053
- And you are?
- Way out of shape.

12:18.226 --> 12:20.126
I'm Sabrina Spellman, your 1:00ish.

12:20.294 --> 12:22.922
The important thing is you're here.
I need someone right away.

12:23.097 --> 12:24.223
Really? Great.

12:24.398 --> 12:26.298
All right. Details.

12:26.467 --> 12:28.697
I like my coffee black,
my pencils sharp,

12:28.870 --> 12:30.667
and someone's who not afraid
to ask questions.

12:30.838 --> 12:33.773
I have a question. Why would I need
to know how you like your coffee?

12:33.941 --> 12:35.875
That's what any good secretary
needs to know.

12:36.043 --> 12:37.476
Secretary?

12:37.645 --> 12:39.738
Yeah, well,
that's not exactly my dream job,

12:39.914 --> 12:41.438
but I guess it's a start.

12:41.616 --> 12:42.640
Well, absolutely.

12:42.817 --> 12:44.808
Yeah, if you play your cards right,
do a good job,

12:44.986 --> 12:49.047
10 to 15 years, you work your way up
to executive secretary.

12:49.223 --> 12:51.783
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, a big one.

12:51.959 --> 12:54.154
For starters,
I don't have any secretarial skills,

12:54.328 --> 12:58.059
and when I make coffee, it comes out
tasting like witches' brew, literally.

12:58.232 --> 12:59.358
Then why are you here?

12:59.534 --> 13:01.195
For a job as a reporter.

13:01.369 --> 13:04.270
No, no, no.
Your résumé was in the secretary pile.

13:04.906 --> 13:06.498
Look, I came all the way here
from Boston.

13:06.674 --> 13:09.040
Could you at least read
my writing sample?

13:09.210 --> 13:11.235
<i>This is an article I wrote
for the Boston Citizen.</i>

13:11.412 --> 13:14.108
I blew the lid off
a phony baked bean scandal.

13:14.815 --> 13:17.784
The lead's quite catchy, but...

13:17.952 --> 13:19.249
But what?

13:19.420 --> 13:20.910
<i>Well, a reporter
at The Herald Examiner</i>

13:21.088 --> 13:22.555
needs to be a little more seasoned.

13:22.723 --> 13:24.054
Why don't we agree to talk

13:24.225 --> 13:26.284
when you've had a little more
writing experience

13:26.460 --> 13:27.757
and, uh, matured a little.

13:28.129 --> 13:29.323
Oh, I am very mature.

13:29.497 --> 13:32.432
<i>I was just at MTV
and between you and me, unh,</i>

13:32.600 --> 13:34.795
all that screaming
gave me a headache.

13:34.969 --> 13:36.197
Kids, huh?

13:36.370 --> 13:37.997
<i>You were at MTV, huh?</i>

13:38.172 --> 13:40.265
One of my friends
was hanging out with a rock band

13:40.441 --> 13:42.568
<i>and the other one needed me there
because she's on TRL.</i>

13:42.743 --> 13:46.839
<i>TRL? My God, it seems like every day
they're into some new drug.</i>

13:47.014 --> 13:48.982
<i>- No, no, no, TRL is a...
- Look.</i>

13:49.150 --> 13:50.640
You're obviously a very fine writer,

13:50.818 --> 13:53.116
and, uh, you have a lot
of youthful exuberance,

13:53.287 --> 13:57.417
so why don't we agree to talk
when that wears off?

14:02.697 --> 14:05.029
Okay, just a little setback. No biggie.

14:05.199 --> 14:07.827
I mean, I said I could get along
on my own and I can. Right, Salem?

14:08.002 --> 14:09.060
What do I care?

14:09.237 --> 14:12.638
I got beat up by a rat.
He humiliated me.

14:13.274 --> 14:15.367
I thought you said
you gave him a licking?

14:15.543 --> 14:17.670
I did, but not in a macho way.

14:18.646 --> 14:20.705
I'm sorry, Salem,
I have bigger problems.

14:20.881 --> 14:22.314
Just butch it up.

14:22.483 --> 14:25.384
Hmm, butch it up. That's an idea.

14:25.553 --> 14:26.918
Work out a little, ha, ha.

14:27.088 --> 14:29.147
Unh! One.

14:31.859 --> 14:34.555
Sabrina, can you help me?

14:34.729 --> 14:37.027
I don't know what to write
about Course of Nature.

14:37.198 --> 14:39.393
Well, just use your notes.

14:40.201 --> 14:43.762
"Lead singer, dreamy.
Guitarist, married.

14:43.938 --> 14:47.374
Drummer, ignored me. Gay?"

14:51.012 --> 14:52.673
What I'm saying is be resourceful.

14:52.847 --> 14:54.747
There's all kinds of information
on the Internet,

14:54.915 --> 14:57.782
in their liner notes,
or you can contact their fan club.

14:59.153 --> 15:00.882
Boy, that sounds like a lot of work.

15:01.055 --> 15:03.023
Hey, Sabrina,
why don't you write the article?

15:03.924 --> 15:06.654
Fine. I'll write it,
but I'm taking the credit.

15:06.827 --> 15:07.987
No more fronting for you.

15:08.162 --> 15:11.256
I would never take credit
for something that you wrote.

15:14.001 --> 15:15.434
Twice in one week.

15:20.675 --> 15:21.733
So how'd it go in New York?

15:21.909 --> 15:23.433
You know,
with that connection of yours.

15:23.911 --> 15:26.880
Oh, oh. I decided that newspaper job
just wasn't for me.

15:27.048 --> 15:29.539
Oh, good choice.
I mean, you'd have to move there.

15:29.717 --> 15:32.345
Plus, you'd need a bicycle
and a, uh, good throwing arm.

15:32.787 --> 15:33.913
It's very well-written.

15:34.088 --> 15:36.318
Thank you. It came very easily.

15:36.490 --> 15:39.288
Sometimes when the muse strikes...
Okay, she wrote it.

15:39.460 --> 15:40.893
But I tried to write about the band,

15:41.062 --> 15:42.927
but then I ran out of words
for "cute" and...

15:43.097 --> 15:45.156
Okay, I absolutely do not care.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.733
Well, I'm glad you liked it.
Now, we haven't discussed money.

15:47.902 --> 15:49.631
I don't know
what the rate is these days,

15:49.804 --> 15:51.203
but how does
10 cents a word sound?

15:51.372 --> 15:53.704
Oh, I'll give you a quarter
just to stop talking.

15:53.874 --> 15:55.671
How about that?
I already got a raise.

15:55.843 --> 15:58.869
This article was for a contest.
We don't pay for it.

15:59.046 --> 16:00.775
And in this case, we don't publish it.

16:00.948 --> 16:04.281
You wanna send this to your mother.
She can tack it up on her fridge.

16:06.721 --> 16:08.780
But I thought you said you liked it?

16:08.956 --> 16:10.583
I said, it was very well-written.

16:10.758 --> 16:13.818
Very professional.
Very well researched, very bland.

16:13.994 --> 16:15.552
Are you calling my writing bland?

16:15.730 --> 16:18.028
No, I think
I'm calling the author bland.

16:18.199 --> 16:23.000
<i>Anything printed in Scorch magazine
represents a certain point of view.</i>

16:23.170 --> 16:25.832
I mean, look around.
These people have life experience.

16:26.006 --> 16:28.270
Cole was in a rock band
that used to open for Green Day.

16:28.442 --> 16:30.103
James has traveled
to every continent.

16:30.277 --> 16:34.577
Leonard is the publisher's cousin,
but the point is, when I look at you,

16:34.749 --> 16:37.149
I'm guessing
your life comes down to,

16:37.318 --> 16:39.878
oh, a junior high certificate
for perfect attendance,

16:40.054 --> 16:41.851
and maybe once
you smoked a ham.

16:43.557 --> 16:46.583
This may come at a bad time,
but, uh, I still have some of that vodka.

16:46.761 --> 16:48.956
Len.
- Worth a shot.

16:49.130 --> 16:51.098
Let's go.

16:52.733 --> 16:54.667
Everyone keeps telling me
I need more experience.

16:54.835 --> 16:56.393
At this rate, I'll never find a job.

16:56.570 --> 16:58.970
<i>What happened to the part-time job
at the Boston Globe?</i>

16:59.507 --> 17:02.067
The job's taken.
By my journalism professor.

17:02.243 --> 17:06.577
Oh, Sabrina, you really blew it.

17:08.816 --> 17:10.374
Honey, put this behind you.

17:10.550 --> 17:14.782
You've been going on and on about it.
You've gotta stop obsessing.

17:14.954 --> 17:17.685
<i>Oh, my God, TRL is on.
Out of my way.</i>

17:18.826 --> 17:21.920
<i>All right, there you have it.
Everybody loves Eminem.</i>

17:22.096 --> 17:24.963
Yeah, do it, Carson.

17:25.398 --> 17:27.094
Okay, getting carried away.

17:27.268 --> 17:28.792
Dial it down.

17:29.403 --> 17:30.870
Cold turkey.

17:31.038 --> 17:32.164
Cold turkey.

17:32.339 --> 17:33.465
Yeah, talk about obsessed.

17:33.641 --> 17:36.735
I'm going into the kitchen to
make a sandwich. Don't turn that off.

17:38.813 --> 17:40.576
<i>At seven,
it's your favorite Australian...</i>

17:40.748 --> 17:43.683
Move, you're blocking the view.

17:44.418 --> 17:46.750
Whoa, someone got into
the Kibbles 'n Steroids.

17:46.921 --> 17:48.513
Next time you're going to
the Big Apple,

17:48.689 --> 17:50.156
take me with you.

17:50.324 --> 17:53.725
I want to deliver a little message
to my friend Ratso.

17:55.663 --> 17:57.597
Yeah, I got a message
I wanna deliver too.

17:57.765 --> 18:00.359
<i>Anyway, we're
gonna get to our next question...</i>

18:00.534 --> 18:01.967
Sorry, Roxie.

18:03.838 --> 18:05.635
Cable's out.

18:07.475 --> 18:08.965
Whatever you're doing, do it fast.

18:09.143 --> 18:11.008
We gotta get back before
Roxie knows we're gone.

18:11.178 --> 18:13.510
Don't worry,
it will only take a second for me

18:13.681 --> 18:16.241
to turn that rodent into ratatouille.

18:22.490 --> 18:24.390
All right, guys,
before we get to our next video,

18:24.558 --> 18:26.253
I'm gonna give this young man
an opportunity

18:26.427 --> 18:29.191
to say something to America.
He wants... Ha, ha, or her.

18:29.363 --> 18:31.194
<i>Survival of the fittest on TRL today.</i>

18:31.365 --> 18:34.095
- Uh, what's your request?
- I want a job.

18:34.702 --> 18:36.795
Okay, what is that,
the new O-Town single?

18:36.971 --> 18:38.666
No, I'm talking about me.
This sounds crazy.

18:38.839 --> 18:41.672
My name is Sabrina Spellman,
I'm a journalist and I can't find a job.

18:41.842 --> 18:45.005
I've gotten a few job offers
but, you know, I said no to them.

18:45.179 --> 18:46.703
Uh, long story short, I'm an idiot.

18:46.881 --> 18:49.543
Okay, there's definitely gonna be a job
in Security opening up here.

18:49.717 --> 18:52.709
You could have that one. Good luck.
All right, we gotta get over here.

18:52.887 --> 18:55.014
Does Security ever lead
to reporting on the air?

18:55.189 --> 18:56.952
All right, cheese-breath.

18:57.124 --> 18:59.684
It's you and me,
right here, right now.

19:00.127 --> 19:02.288
So you brought some of your friends
from the sewer, huh?

19:02.463 --> 19:03.953
Oh, please.

19:04.899 --> 19:06.867
Not the face.

19:07.535 --> 19:09.162
Welcome back, New York City,
Times Square.

19:09.336 --> 19:10.894
<i>I'm Carson Daly. TRL, we're...</i>

19:11.071 --> 19:13.869
I'm sorry, one last thing.
I wanna say to all you guys out there,

19:14.041 --> 19:16.942
make sure you know a good
opportunity when you see it, okay?

19:17.111 --> 19:20.137
People aren't just gonna hand you
your dream job on a silver platter.

19:20.314 --> 19:23.681
Well, in fact, if they give you a job
carrying a silver platter, take it.

19:23.851 --> 19:24.875
What I'm saying is

19:25.052 --> 19:27.782
<i>whether it's an established publication
like New York Herald Examiner</i>

19:27.955 --> 19:29.547
<i>or a pretentious upstart zine
like Scorch,</i>

19:29.723 --> 19:31.714
don't be too proud
to start at the bottom.

19:32.192 --> 19:33.955
- Anything else?
- Uh...

19:34.128 --> 19:35.891
- Meat kills, wo-hoo!
- All right, guys.

19:36.063 --> 19:37.690
Sorry. Sorry about that everybody.

19:39.767 --> 19:41.166
All right...

19:41.569 --> 19:44.129
If you called me here to tell me
I'll never work in this business,

19:44.305 --> 19:45.329
I figured that out.

19:45.506 --> 19:47.497
And that's why I'm done
with this stupid job search,

19:47.675 --> 19:49.404
and who knows,
maybe journalism all together.

19:49.577 --> 19:52.273
And just because I don't have
metal things sticking out of my face,

19:52.446 --> 19:53.811
doesn't mean I'm not a good writer.

19:53.981 --> 19:55.209
Period. End of sentence.

19:57.284 --> 19:59.752
Fine. I'll tell Jonathan
you're turning down the job.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.046
Job?

20:01.488 --> 20:04.685
I called you down here
because I'm offering you a position.

20:04.858 --> 20:06.052
Actually, our publisher is.

20:06.226 --> 20:08.091
The only thing I'd offer you
is a new wardrobe.

20:08.262 --> 20:10.992
That's insane. Why would
the publisher offer me a job?

20:11.165 --> 20:13.963
That was my question exactly,
except for the profanity.

20:14.134 --> 20:17.331
<i>Apparently Jonathan caught you
on TRL. Liked what he saw.</i>

20:17.504 --> 20:19.734
He hired me because he said
I remind him of Diana Ross.

20:19.907 --> 20:22.102
It doesn't matter.
She's not interested in this gig.

20:22.276 --> 20:24.107
I mean,
it's not serious journalism, right?

20:24.311 --> 20:25.539
He saw me on TV.

20:25.713 --> 20:27.704
You happen to know if he taped it,
because I forgot.

20:27.881 --> 20:29.872
I'll tell him you can't do it.
The club scene...

20:30.050 --> 20:32.143
Excuse me, I can do it.

20:32.319 --> 20:34.617
Yeah, I get it, Bo-peep.
The job's not right for you.

20:34.788 --> 20:35.880
Okay, my name's not Bo-peep,

20:36.056 --> 20:38.524
and job may not be right for me,
but I am right for the job.

20:38.692 --> 20:40.990
I just wanna make that
fine yet important distinction.

20:41.161 --> 20:43.026
I can do it. Don't want to.

20:43.197 --> 20:45.222
- So you'll take it?
- Yes, please. When do I start?

20:52.806 --> 20:54.740
Okay, smoothies all around.

20:54.908 --> 20:57.968
It's time for a toast
to Sabrina's new job.

20:59.613 --> 21:01.808
Morgan, did you leave
your laundry on the table?

21:01.982 --> 21:03.574
No, that's Salem.

21:03.751 --> 21:05.742
- He got into the gauze.
Ow!

21:05.919 --> 21:06.943
Did you hear that?
