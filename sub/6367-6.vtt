<i>I've been thinking.</i>

00:10.824 --> 00:14.757
<i>It's probably time</i>
<i>for me to be moving on.</i>

00:15.890 --> 00:18.124
<i>Where would you go?</i>

00:18.157 --> 00:20.224
<i>What would you do?</i>

00:20.257 --> 00:23.257
<i>Best thing I can do</i>
<i>for you is to leave.</i>

00:25.524 --> 00:29.558

standing too close to you.</i>

<i>The rules are different</i>
<i>out here.</i>

00:41.124 --> 00:42.857
<i>No, same rules.</i>

00:42.890 --> 00:46.091
<i>Same rules they had since</i>
<i>the first man picked up</i>
<i>the first stick</i>

00:46.124 --> 00:48.623
<i>and beat the second man's</i>

00:49.623 --> 00:51.990
<i>People like you and me,</i>

00:52.024 --> 00:54.391
<i>we don't need bars.</i>

00:54.424 --> 00:57.091
<i>We build our own cells.</i>

01:01.690 --> 01:04.790
<i>Every time I think</i>
<i>I know the way forward,</i>

01:04.824 --> 01:07.757
<i>something just kicks me</i>
<i>back on my ass.</i>

01:07.790 --> 01:11.124
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what's coming next,</i>
<i>but it's coming.</i>

02:44.157 --> 02:45.990
Who the hell
left this here?

02:46.024 --> 02:48.491
It's not from around here,
I can tell you that.

03:01.558 --> 03:03.723
Big shot thinks he's got
a fancy freakin' car

03:03.757 --> 03:05.590
and he can block the pump.

03:05.623 --> 03:08.424
It's like he's telling
the world he's hot shit.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.790
Ooh-whee.

03:11.824 --> 03:14.790
This is one
fine-ass machine.

03:18.924 --> 03:21.924
- I have to piss.
- Do it quickly.

03:21.957 --> 03:24.057
We're on a schedule.

03:30.690 --> 03:33.790
Must have cost
a fucking fortune.

03:35.623 --> 03:37.890
What's the matter?
It ain't gonna bite you.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.690
My apologies, gentlemen.

03:54.723 --> 03:56.723
I'll just get that
out of your way.

03:56.757 --> 03:58.824
Oh, shit.
It's 007.

03:58.857 --> 04:00.790
<i>Nah, it's Austin Powers.</i>

04:00.824 --> 04:02.657
Well, 00-homo, why don't
you take your ride

04:02.690 --> 04:04.690
and get back to your own
fucking country?

04:08.723 --> 04:11.690
You know,
you shouldn't be smoking

04:11.723 --> 04:14.191
at a petrol station.

04:14.224 --> 04:17.824
Safety first,
fun later.

04:17.857 --> 04:19.957
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

05:11.558 --> 05:14.224
Fuck!

05:23.790 --> 05:26.391
Alex Longshadow.
What brings you around?

05:27.790 --> 05:29.491
Ahem.

05:29.524 --> 05:33.057
Anything you want to say,
you can say in front of her.

05:33.091 --> 05:35.824
George Hunter
wants me out as chief.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.857
And?

05:37.890 --> 05:39.491
And they have the votes
to unseat me.

05:39.524 --> 05:42.657
Sounds to me you have
a real problem there.

05:42.690 --> 05:45.623
If Hunter becomes chief,
you can kiss any piece
of that casino good-bye.

05:45.657 --> 05:47.124
Hunter won't
let you near it.

05:47.157 --> 05:49.957
Yeah, well, you always said
that you wouldn't either.

05:49.990 --> 05:53.690
I'm young, as you
so enjoy pointing out.

05:53.723 --> 05:55.824
My mind can change.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.524
- Get me the list.
- List? What list?

06:00.558 --> 06:04.623
<i>Of the council members</i>
<i>who will vote against you.</i>

06:04.657 --> 06:07.723
- They meet next week.
- That's plenty of time.

06:07.757 --> 06:10.723
- <i>Okay. Thank you.</i>
- <i>No, don't thank me.</i>

06:10.757 --> 06:13.690
After all,
we're partners.

06:26.491 --> 06:28.723
- Partners.
- Yeah.

06:43.491 --> 06:45.790
Hey.

06:45.824 --> 06:47.957
The new you.

06:49.657 --> 06:52.590
Passports, credit cards,
IDs, the works.

06:55.024 --> 06:57.224
- Buddy, buddy, buddy!
- All right, all right.

06:57.257 --> 07:00.391
Oh, man.

07:00.424 --> 07:02.458
Just keep it safe, okay?

07:02.491 --> 07:04.191
This is great.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.124
- Don't fuck around with it.
- Thanks, man.

07:06.157 --> 07:08.224
Don't thank me.
Thank Job.

07:17.558 --> 07:20.491
<i>Sorry, friend.</i>
<i>We don't open till noon.</i>

07:28.890 --> 07:33.391
Gentlemen, I'll have
what my young friend
Jason is having.

07:33.424 --> 07:36.024
Hello, Jason.

07:36.057 --> 07:40.257
<i>Um, I said</i>
<i>we're not open.</i>

07:47.924 --> 07:49.357
Where's the money, Jason?

07:49.391 --> 07:51.157
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>you're talking about.</i>

07:51.191 --> 07:54.024
- You know
who I am, right?
- Yeah.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.558
Then you know I mean it
when I tell you

07:56.590 --> 07:58.924
this is the last time
I'm going to ask.

08:00.558 --> 08:02.024
Where's the fucking money?

08:02.057 --> 08:03.690
Hey, Sugar.

08:03.723 --> 08:06.790
Don't you have some sort
of house rule about guns?

08:06.824 --> 08:10.024
- Yeah, no guns.
- Right.

08:10.057 --> 08:14.324
You hear that, Clover?
No guns allowed.

08:14.357 --> 08:16.657
Well, then,

08:16.690 --> 08:18.757
I think we might
have a problem.

08:31.757 --> 08:33.690
Hey, Hood!

08:42.357 --> 08:44.790
- You all right?
- Yeah.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.391
What money?

08:56.391 --> 08:59.623
Why is the casino
so important to you?

08:59.657 --> 09:01.957
I mean, you've got all
these other businesses.

09:01.990 --> 09:03.590
Just seems like
a lot of trouble.

09:03.623 --> 09:05.957
I have no illusions
about what I am.

09:05.990 --> 09:07.558
These other businesses,

09:07.590 --> 09:10.057
they'll either kill me
or I die with them.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.091
Either way,
I leave nothing behind.

09:12.124 --> 09:14.491
And since I have
no children...

09:17.824 --> 09:22.057
So the casino,
being protected from
local law enforcement,

09:22.091 --> 09:25.024
offers me the shelter I need
to do something legitimate.

09:25.057 --> 09:28.091
You know, something that
will live on when I'm gone.

09:31.257 --> 09:33.124
Now do you understand?

09:34.790 --> 09:36.357
Yeah.

09:36.391 --> 09:37.790
<i>Go on.</i>

09:37.824 --> 09:39.623
<i>Sheriff Hood and I</i>
<i>were having coffee</i>

09:39.657 --> 09:42.324
<i>when this one guy</i>
<i>chases the other guy</i>
<i>through the door.</i>

09:42.357 --> 09:44.257
Have you ever seen
either one of them before?

09:44.291 --> 09:47.291
Never.
They were arguing
with each other.

09:47.324 --> 09:49.291
Deputy.

09:49.324 --> 09:51.723
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

09:51.757 --> 09:55.391
See, the one guy,
he had a thick
British accent.

09:55.424 --> 09:57.191
Who fired first?

09:57.224 --> 09:59.623
You know, you really
got to start taking
better care of yourself.

09:59.657 --> 10:02.957
I'm still in one piece.

10:02.990 --> 10:06.491
But the day's just started
and the shooter's still
out there.

10:08.091 --> 10:10.824
Hey, I'm fine.

10:10.857 --> 10:13.157
Okay?

10:13.191 --> 10:15.723
We got an alert
out for his car.
A red Jag, right?

10:15.757 --> 10:18.157
Yeah. Yeah, should be
easy enough to spot.

10:18.191 --> 10:20.558
<i>Holy shit.</i>

10:20.590 --> 10:22.690
Uh-huh.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.690
Is it just me,
or does it seem
like every scumbag

10:26.723 --> 10:29.757
with an automatic weapon
comes to Banshee to shoot you?

10:29.790 --> 10:31.558
- No, it's just you.
- Huh.

10:31.623 --> 10:33.224
You all right?

10:33.257 --> 10:35.458
Yeah, thanks for asking.

10:35.491 --> 10:37.524
- Did you get a good look
at him, Sheriff?
- Good enough.

10:37.558 --> 10:39.757
Yeah, 'cause you just
happened to be here when
the shooting started, right?

10:39.790 --> 10:43.623
- Yeah, I live here.
- Yeah, I guess that
much is true.

10:45.623 --> 10:47.157
What?

10:47.191 --> 10:49.657
Maybe now's not
the best time to give
the sheriff a hard time.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.191
- I mean,
he just got shot at.
- Come on, Emmett.

10:52.224 --> 10:55.191
You don't wonder
why this shit keeps
happening with him?

10:55.224 --> 10:57.391
Sure, I do.
But you know
he's still the boss.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.091
So you don't question
anything that he does, huh?

10:59.124 --> 11:00.790
Maybe that's
the difference
between us.

11:00.824 --> 11:02.590
No, the difference
between us is you
still haven't

11:02.657 --> 11:05.558
wrapped your mind around
the fact that he's in charge.

11:10.690 --> 11:14.291
What I want to know is who's gonna
pay for this stuff?

11:14.324 --> 11:16.357
- Who's the English guy?
- His name's Quentin.

11:16.391 --> 11:18.091
Quentin, he's an enforcer
for Brantley.

11:18.124 --> 11:20.391
Brantley?
That's the guy you stole
the money off, right?

11:20.424 --> 11:21.957
Yeah, yeah.

11:21.990 --> 11:23.723
Dude, I've only seen
Quentin once before, okay?

11:23.757 --> 11:25.324
But the guy's
a fucking legend.

11:25.357 --> 11:26.924
They sent four guys
for him once--

11:26.957 --> 11:29.723
Wow, great story.
What did you take?

11:29.757 --> 11:32.357
It was like a drug
payment or something.
I don't know.

11:32.424 --> 11:33.824
Brantley's into
a lot of shit, man.

11:33.857 --> 11:35.257
Look, I was just supposed
to pick up the money

11:35.291 --> 11:36.890
from some guy in Eugene
and run it back.

11:36.924 --> 11:39.957
- But you ran off
with it instead.
- Yeah, because I had to.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.924
Look, I saw some shit
I wasn't supposed to see.

11:41.957 --> 11:44.191
Brantley-- Brantley's
a paranoid fuck.

11:44.224 --> 11:46.757
Look, I knew I was getting
sent on some sort of errand

11:46.790 --> 11:49.157
- that I wasn't supposed
to come back from.
- Shut up. Shut up.

11:52.057 --> 11:53.491
How much are we talking?

11:53.524 --> 11:55.723
62K.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.024
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, I know.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.391
- I fucking panicked, man.
- Shut up.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.957
Where is it now?

12:10.790 --> 12:13.391
I figured, like,
if I got far enough away,

12:13.424 --> 12:16.623
they'd have to
forget about it.

12:16.657 --> 12:18.757
Forget about it?

12:20.124 --> 12:22.024
They're never gonna
forget about it.

12:22.057 --> 12:24.890
These guys have rules.

12:29.857 --> 12:33.057
There's only 49 here.
You're 13 short.

12:33.091 --> 12:35.357
- Where is it?
- I spent some.

12:35.391 --> 12:37.024
I've been
using it to live off
since I left Oregon.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.157
You must have lived
pretty fucking well.

12:41.157 --> 12:42.957
God damn it.

12:42.990 --> 12:45.757
- I've got to get
out of here, man.
- And go where?

12:45.790 --> 12:48.357
- He's still
out there, though.
- Go where?

12:48.391 --> 12:50.024
Where are you gonna go?

12:50.057 --> 12:52.291
<i>He followed you</i>
<i>across the country.</i>

12:52.324 --> 12:55.091
He's gonna find you.
What are you gonna do?

12:55.124 --> 12:57.757
I'm so fucked.

13:17.291 --> 13:19.857
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>out of this.</i>

13:19.890 --> 13:21.191
All right,
hey, hey, hey.

13:21.224 --> 13:23.458
Listen to me.
Hey.

13:23.491 --> 13:26.124
Jason, listen to me.

13:26.157 --> 13:28.558
I'll figure
something out, okay?

13:28.590 --> 13:31.857
Just calm down.

13:31.890 --> 13:35.124
In the meantime,
you don't leave this room.

13:36.924 --> 13:40.324
- Say it.
- I stay in the room.

13:40.357 --> 13:42.590
Good.

13:42.623 --> 13:45.357
- Maybe clean it up.
- Yeah.

14:35.590 --> 14:37.157
Eyes forward.

14:37.191 --> 14:38.558
Watch your position.

14:38.590 --> 14:40.491
<i>She's such a freak.</i>

14:40.524 --> 14:42.790
<i>And her mother</i>
<i>is a total whack job.</i>

14:50.324 --> 14:51.790
Hi, baby.

14:54.324 --> 14:56.623
You can't be here.
You know that.

14:56.657 --> 14:58.657
I couldn't help it.
I wanted to see you.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.124
Mom, no.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.324
<i>Deva, watch your speed.</i>

15:03.357 --> 15:05.191
You can't keep doing this.

15:05.224 --> 15:08.291
Sneaking into the house
and leaving me little toys.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.623
It's creepy.

15:09.657 --> 15:11.857
Deva, slow down right now.

15:13.191 --> 15:14.890
I'm sorry I lied to you.

15:14.924 --> 15:17.257
I was only trying
to keep you safe.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.124
Deva, brake!

15:19.157 --> 15:21.224
I didn't have a mother
to keep me safe.

15:21.257 --> 15:23.890
Please slow down.
Slow down!

15:23.924 --> 15:26.091
- Brake!

15:26.124 --> 15:28.657
Pull over right now!

15:28.690 --> 15:30.057
Honey, it's me.

15:30.091 --> 15:32.424
Deva, please slow down!
Please!

15:32.458 --> 15:33.790
I don't know who that is.

15:54.024 --> 15:56.224
Hey, Sugar.

15:56.257 --> 15:57.990
How you doing, Brock?

15:58.024 --> 16:00.690
Uh, pretty good,
you know.

16:00.723 --> 16:04.091
Just trying
to track down Hood.

16:04.124 --> 16:05.790
Thought you had
radios for that.

16:05.824 --> 16:08.157
Yeah, well, you know Hood.
He never keeps his on.

16:08.191 --> 16:10.857
And I was just
passing by, so I...

16:14.723 --> 16:16.990
Man, that was
something yesterday.
How you holding up?

16:17.024 --> 16:18.957
I didn't get a belly
full of lead.

16:18.990 --> 16:21.824
Yeah, well,
I've got to head back.

16:21.857 --> 16:23.324
So, good to see you.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.257
Yeah, I'll tell Hood
you were looking for him.

16:25.291 --> 16:27.124
All right, thanks.

16:34.990 --> 16:37.890
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay. We were
screaming at her...

16:40.990 --> 16:43.723
- What the hell happened, Deva?
- Nothing. It was an accident.

16:43.757 --> 16:45.458
That's crap.
You could have hurt someone.

16:45.491 --> 16:47.157
You could have killed someone.
What are you thinking?

16:47.191 --> 16:49.757
They were talking
shit about Mom.

16:49.790 --> 16:53.091
<i>She freaked out.</i>
<i>She started going super fast.</i>

16:53.124 --> 16:55.424
- She almost killed us.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

16:55.458 --> 16:58.057
- You're sorry? You could
have killed those girls.
- Hey, you talk to me.

16:58.091 --> 17:00.424
Your freak show of a kid
put my daughter in danger.

17:02.357 --> 17:04.491
You say another fucking
word about my daughter

17:04.523 --> 17:06.090
and I'll feed you
your fucking lungs.

17:06.124 --> 17:08.623
<i>Got me,</i>
<i>you piece of shit?</i>

17:23.191 --> 17:25.824
- Mom.
- Max.

17:28.957 --> 17:31.257
Come here.
Oh.

17:34.857 --> 17:36.790
I didn't know
you were coming.

17:36.824 --> 17:38.491
You didn't?
Didn't Daddy tell you?

17:38.524 --> 17:41.458
I mean, he said
you were coming,
but he didn't say when.

17:41.491 --> 17:43.291
I'm here now.

17:43.324 --> 17:45.024
Come here.
Mwah.

17:45.091 --> 17:48.191
- How are you?
- I'm so happy to see you.

17:48.224 --> 17:50.990
- Deva's not home.
- Know what, buddy?

17:51.024 --> 17:53.291
This time, I came
just to see you.

17:53.324 --> 17:55.291
Go show me
that trick again.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.990
- Let me see.
- All right.

18:02.091 --> 18:04.491
- You found this
in his apartment?
- Yep.

18:04.524 --> 18:06.857
Why would the sheriff have
a picture of your family?

18:06.890 --> 18:09.357
I have no idea.

18:15.458 --> 18:18.458
And what about these guys
that shot at him yesterday?

18:18.491 --> 18:21.424
Well, we haven't
ID'd the stiff yet

18:21.458 --> 18:24.657
and one of them
got away, so we don't
have much to go on there.

18:30.524 --> 18:32.357
Gordon, you all right?

18:34.690 --> 18:37.191
Yeah, sure, Brock.
I'm great.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.623
On top
of the fucking world.

18:40.657 --> 18:42.157
Hey.

18:42.191 --> 18:44.524
You asked me, remember?

18:44.558 --> 18:47.157
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm just...

18:50.091 --> 18:53.091
I'm not at my best
these days.

18:56.723 --> 18:58.224
Listen,

18:58.257 --> 19:01.424
you let me worry
about Hood, all right?

19:03.091 --> 19:05.057
I feel like things
might be starting to
break there a little bit.

19:05.091 --> 19:07.391
We just got to be patient,
wait for them to break
a little more.

19:07.424 --> 19:10.924
- <i>All right?</i>
- <i>Yeah, all right.</i>
<i> Thanks.</i>

19:34.790 --> 19:37.291
Nice spot.

19:38.924 --> 19:41.024
Sheriff Hood.

19:43.224 --> 19:46.357
Myself, I stopped
drinking some years ago.

19:47.824 --> 19:49.757
I didn't make
a very good drunk.

19:49.790 --> 19:52.558
Some might say
I made an excellent one.

19:53.790 --> 19:55.524
Either way,

19:55.558 --> 19:57.957
I now feed booze
to the birds.

19:58.024 --> 20:02.757
For some reason
it soothes me.

20:05.224 --> 20:07.623
You're not exactly
keeping a low profile.

20:09.357 --> 20:13.257
And you don't fight
like a small-town sheriff.

20:13.291 --> 20:15.558
You, my friend,
have the sort of skills

20:15.590 --> 20:18.024
that can't be taught,
only acquired.

20:18.057 --> 20:21.224
We were all something else
once upon a time, eh?

20:21.257 --> 20:23.990
Guess so.

20:26.057 --> 20:28.790
Men like us,

20:28.824 --> 20:32.191
we've every reason
to appreciate a day
like this.

20:35.924 --> 20:37.391
Men like us?

20:39.357 --> 20:42.124
Fighters.

20:42.157 --> 20:45.491
Killers.

20:45.524 --> 20:47.024
Armies of one.

20:49.824 --> 20:51.324
I don't know
anything about you,

20:51.357 --> 20:53.057
but I know everything
I need to know.

20:53.091 --> 20:54.790
The way we live our lives,

20:54.824 --> 20:57.790
we know every day
could be our last.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.458
Sooner or later,
it will be.

20:59.491 --> 21:01.357
The sooner, most likely.

21:01.391 --> 21:04.324
<i>Maybe, but right now</i>
<i>let's talk about the money.</i>

21:05.924 --> 21:08.091
When I figure I'll have
to stay in a place for a bit,

21:08.124 --> 21:12.324
I like to check out
the local law enforcement.

21:12.357 --> 21:14.924
It's a practice
I've developed
for some years.

21:14.957 --> 21:17.424
A little due diligence.

21:17.458 --> 21:21.491
Well, when I discovered
the sheriff's name
was Hood...

21:23.957 --> 21:26.824
that complicates things.

21:27.723 --> 21:30.157
How so?

21:30.191 --> 21:33.024
In any other case,
you and I might be able

21:33.057 --> 21:36.690
to work out some kind
of professional courtesies.

21:36.723 --> 21:39.757
But a father's not
gonna give up his son.

21:39.790 --> 21:41.890
You're not leaving
town without him.

21:41.924 --> 21:44.324
No.

21:44.357 --> 21:46.623
I have a strict mandate
to bring the boy

21:46.657 --> 21:48.391
and the money
back to Brantley.

21:48.424 --> 21:51.857
He likes to deal
with this sort of thing
up close and personal.

21:55.723 --> 21:58.124
So...

21:58.157 --> 22:01.257
So, one of us

22:01.291 --> 22:03.757
is gonna have
to kill the other.

22:07.391 --> 22:09.291
<i>Which is a shame, really,</i>

22:09.324 --> 22:12.757
since neither one of us
made this mess.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.524
You know,
in my experience...

22:17.424 --> 22:19.291
there's usually
a deal to be made.

22:20.357 --> 22:22.623
I have a similar
experience,

22:22.657 --> 22:24.057
but in this case,
I don't really see--

22:24.091 --> 22:26.623
50 on top of the 62
the boy owes.

22:29.357 --> 22:30.824
So you're offering me
a bribe?

22:30.857 --> 22:33.424
Not a bribe,
a token.

22:34.558 --> 22:36.890
I'd give you more
if I had it.

22:36.924 --> 22:40.657
50,000, you go back,
you tell them he's dead.

22:43.257 --> 22:45.024
You and me...

22:47.824 --> 22:50.690
we both get to live
another day in the sun.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.990
- What's that?
- That's the 13

22:56.024 --> 22:59.224
to go with the 49,
make up the 62 you owe.

22:59.257 --> 23:01.558
Wait, you're giving me
your money?

23:01.590 --> 23:04.391
No, I'm giving it
to Quentin, and this.

23:04.424 --> 23:07.191
- What are you doing?
- We have an agreement.

23:09.723 --> 23:12.224
<i>I mean, I can't</i>
<i>let you do this.</i>

23:12.257 --> 23:15.224
Really?
Come on, cut the shit.

23:15.257 --> 23:17.790
<i>When do we bring</i>
<i>him the cash?</i>

23:17.824 --> 23:20.590
<i>Not we. Me.</i>

23:20.623 --> 23:23.324
- What do I do?
- You get on a train,
go to Canada.

23:23.357 --> 23:25.458
<i>Live your life.</i>

23:31.857 --> 23:34.224
112,000, all in.

23:39.024 --> 23:42.324
- Don't want to count it?
- Just make sure you keep
your end.

23:43.924 --> 23:46.690
I will.

23:46.723 --> 23:48.857
My condolences, then.

23:48.890 --> 23:50.524
What for?

23:50.558 --> 23:52.890
You just lost a son.

23:56.458 --> 23:59.124
- Yes, I did.
- Let's hope so.

23:59.157 --> 24:02.257
For all our sakes.

24:02.291 --> 24:03.491
Why are you helping me?

24:07.257 --> 24:10.191
You're not the first guy
to make a mistake.

24:16.057 --> 24:18.124
Things happen.

25:09.191 --> 25:11.424
Mr. Procter.

25:11.458 --> 25:14.057
Juliet,

25:14.091 --> 25:16.091
I told you many times
before, call me Kai.

25:18.024 --> 25:19.857
You're here
for your money?

25:19.890 --> 25:22.590
- If that's okay.
- Of course.

25:22.623 --> 25:24.890
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.957
Don't ever apologize for
asking for what you're owed.

25:27.990 --> 25:32.690
It's just that sometimes
I get a little behind
on the rent, so...

25:32.723 --> 25:34.723
It's fine.
It's all fine.

25:34.757 --> 25:37.458
Payroll is next door.
Why don't you come with me?

25:41.091 --> 25:43.057
Uh, actually,

25:43.124 --> 25:45.623
I need to go pick up my son
from the babysitter soon.

25:45.657 --> 25:49.524
So I should probably
just get out of here.

25:49.558 --> 25:52.024
Just stay a little while.

26:40.524 --> 26:42.558
Fuck!

26:42.590 --> 26:44.590
Hello, Jason.

26:44.623 --> 26:46.558
Get your knickers on.

26:48.558 --> 26:50.790
So it went smoothly?

26:50.824 --> 26:52.524
I guess so.

26:52.558 --> 26:55.324
- And now you're broke.
- Temporarily.

26:56.924 --> 26:59.657
That's a lot of money
to give a stranger.

26:59.690 --> 27:03.324
Why the kid?
It's not like you
owe him anything.

27:03.391 --> 27:04.957
No.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.690
But maybe I owe
his old man.

27:09.524 --> 27:11.191
Hmm.

27:14.590 --> 27:16.357
Got rats in the basement.

27:16.391 --> 27:19.723
<i>Fumigated a few weeks ago.</i>
<i>Thought they were gone.</i>

27:19.757 --> 27:22.391
<i>Turns out they only wanted me</i>
<i>to think they were gone.</i>

27:22.424 --> 27:26.458
<i>So now I'm bringing out</i>
<i> the big guns.</i>

27:29.424 --> 27:31.790
Played by a bunch
of rodents.

28:08.824 --> 28:11.657
<i>Hey! Hello!</i>

28:16.291 --> 28:18.824
Now I thought
we had a deal.

28:20.558 --> 28:23.091
If you thought that,
you wouldn't have
followed me, eh?

28:23.124 --> 28:26.324
True.
I guess we're both
full of shit, huh?

28:26.357 --> 28:29.291
I suppose so.

28:29.324 --> 28:31.391
The kid in the trunk?

28:31.424 --> 28:34.524
Yeah.

28:34.558 --> 28:37.558
- <i>Hello!</i>
- You all right, kid?

28:40.890 --> 28:44.191
You know,

28:44.224 --> 28:46.790
you could have been
a long way away by now.

28:48.657 --> 28:50.990
I couldn't do it.

28:51.024 --> 28:53.723
Professional pride
fucking with me.

28:53.757 --> 28:56.157
Fair enough.

28:58.757 --> 29:00.391
So what now?

29:14.590 --> 29:17.458
You're no
small-town sheriff.

29:17.491 --> 29:19.191
Nope.

30:07.957 --> 30:10.524
Hello! Hey.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.157
Let's go.

30:22.424 --> 30:24.890
Dad.

30:28.424 --> 30:30.491
Dad.

30:31.890 --> 30:33.458
Dad, you're drunk.

30:33.491 --> 30:35.623
No, I just had
some drinks.

30:35.657 --> 30:36.924
Come on.

30:41.191 --> 30:42.824
We're almost there.
Two more steps.

30:42.857 --> 30:44.990
I've got it.

30:45.024 --> 30:47.257
Two more steps.

30:51.857 --> 30:54.890
Back to bed, Max.
Now.

30:57.124 --> 30:58.957
Are you okay, Dad?

31:01.458 --> 31:03.657
I'm good, Max.
Just go to bed, okay?

31:03.690 --> 31:05.824
- It's okay.
- Dad's okay.

31:08.723 --> 31:10.324
It's good.

31:12.124 --> 31:13.857
Dad.

31:18.024 --> 31:20.224
I'm sorry.

31:29.857 --> 31:32.690
I took this off
your father before
I buried him.

31:36.524 --> 31:38.957
I don't know why
I kept it.

31:38.990 --> 31:42.690
Just didn't feel right
to throw it away.

31:44.424 --> 31:46.657
I thought you
should have it.

31:48.057 --> 31:49.890
Yeah.

31:49.924 --> 31:52.391
There's a train,
leaves tomorrow at 10:00.

31:52.424 --> 31:54.790
I'll be by at 9:30
to pick you up.

31:54.824 --> 31:57.723
You get on the train,
you go north.

31:57.757 --> 31:58.957
You go all the way
to Canada.

31:58.990 --> 32:00.424
Even you can't
fuck that up.

32:00.458 --> 32:03.458
Okay, yeah, I got it.

32:03.491 --> 32:05.257
Uh-huh.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.857
What about you?

32:06.890 --> 32:09.157
Who knows?
Maybe one of these days,

32:09.191 --> 32:11.424
I'll be getting on
one of those trains myself.

32:11.458 --> 32:13.324
Huh. Not yet?

32:14.857 --> 32:16.857
- Not yet.
- Hey...

32:20.690 --> 32:22.424
Thank you.

32:27.157 --> 32:29.324
Just remember,

32:29.357 --> 32:32.257
you only get
one second chance.

32:33.357 --> 32:35.257
I know.

32:43.024 --> 32:45.157
Here's your toast.

32:45.224 --> 32:47.957
Sure I can't get you
anything else?

32:47.990 --> 32:49.890
No, thank you.

32:52.723 --> 32:54.657
<i>I haven't seen you before.</i>
<i>Are you new?</i>

32:54.690 --> 32:56.590
Uh, I just moved
from New York.

32:58.524 --> 33:00.057
Most people go
in the other direction.

33:00.091 --> 33:01.723
<i>What, do you got family</i>
<i>in Michigan?</i>

33:01.757 --> 33:04.124
Just needed a change.

33:06.690 --> 33:08.857
What can I get you,
Mr. Marine?

33:08.890 --> 33:11.623
My name's Gordon Hopewell.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.723
Carrie.

33:13.757 --> 33:15.357
I know.

33:30.924 --> 33:33.391
Don't say anything.

33:33.424 --> 33:35.491
What can I get you?

33:35.558 --> 33:37.723
I'll take blueberry
pancakes and some syrup.

33:37.757 --> 33:39.723
You got it, honey.

33:43.890 --> 33:47.057
When did you first figure out
your father was a criminal?

33:55.990 --> 33:58.723
<i>* You don't know </i>

33:58.757 --> 34:01.091
<i>* What you're doing </i>

34:02.957 --> 34:07.990
<i>* All that you</i>
<i>will ruin... *</i>

34:09.224 --> 34:11.424
I heard you were on
the way out of here.

34:11.458 --> 34:13.458
Not without
saying good-bye.

34:13.491 --> 34:16.391
So you put the pieces
back together?

34:16.424 --> 34:18.590
Yeah, just about.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.157
Be nice to keep it
that way.

34:22.857 --> 34:24.824
I'm just here
to thank you.

34:24.857 --> 34:28.324
Well, then,
one for the road.

34:43.989 --> 34:46.056
<i>Hey.</i>

34:47.190 --> 34:49.989
Nobody needs to know
your plans.

34:50.024 --> 34:51.224
It's my last night
in town.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.657
I'm just trying
to make it count.

34:54.291 --> 34:56.889
<i>You don't want</i>
<i>to go there.</i>

34:56.924 --> 35:00.790
See, that one's
more trouble than you know.

35:00.824 --> 35:02.990
It's the good kind
of trouble, all right?

35:22.890 --> 35:24.391
What?

35:24.424 --> 35:26.890
Nothing.

35:28.224 --> 35:30.291
This is nice.

35:33.057 --> 35:35.091
Yeah.

35:50.057 --> 35:52.458
What are you
thinking about?

35:57.257 --> 35:59.424
I don't know.

36:01.990 --> 36:04.291
I was thinking
about something

36:04.324 --> 36:07.191
someone said to me
the other day.

36:09.924 --> 36:14.491
I mean, you get used
to a certain way of being

36:14.524 --> 36:16.657
and, uh...

36:30.391 --> 36:33.124
Do you think
we are who we are?

36:33.157 --> 36:35.657
Or do you think
we can change?

36:38.391 --> 36:40.723
What, you mean
people like you?

36:41.623 --> 36:43.524
Well, me, you,

36:43.558 --> 36:45.723
people in general.

36:50.224 --> 36:53.824
I don't know if anyone
ever changes, really.

36:53.857 --> 36:56.824
But we can evolve, right?

36:59.357 --> 37:01.157
I mean, that's what
we're trying to do, isn't it?

37:01.191 --> 37:04.857
Just become better versions
of ourselves.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.890
So you think
we evolve?

37:26.657 --> 37:28.924
I'm counting on it.

39:32.057 --> 39:34.458
You're either with me

39:34.491 --> 39:36.124
or you're not.

39:39.857 --> 39:41.491
Do you understand?

40:11.458 --> 40:13.057
You okay?

40:15.924 --> 40:17.990
I'm fine.

42:35.124 --> 42:36.590
Long day?

42:36.623 --> 42:38.890
You have no idea.

42:38.924 --> 42:41.757
Hmm, you know,
my mother used to say

42:41.790 --> 42:44.357
even a train got
to stop sometime.

42:45.924 --> 42:49.690
I'm gonna make you
my Last Call cocktail.

42:51.224 --> 42:53.391
Why don't you
make it a double?

42:53.424 --> 42:55.657
No, I'll make it
any damn way I want to.

42:55.690 --> 42:59.124
Here.

43:01.857 --> 43:04.391
- Nice.
- Where's mine?

43:04.424 --> 43:06.257
<i>Hey, Job.</i>

43:07.357 --> 43:09.623
<i>How was New York?</i>

43:11.857 --> 43:15.124
I see you got
your ass kicked again
while I was gone.

43:15.157 --> 43:17.690
It's starting
to be a thing.

43:17.723 --> 43:20.424
Every man needs a hobby.

43:20.458 --> 43:21.957
Do I even want to know?

43:21.990 --> 43:25.191
Probably not.
How'd it go?

43:26.257 --> 43:28.124
How'd it go?

43:32.124 --> 43:34.757
You couldn't
get rid of them?

43:34.790 --> 43:36.990
There was a wrinkle.

43:43.957 --> 43:46.324
I should have
found out everything
there was to know

43:46.357 --> 43:48.857
about those diamonds
before you went in.

43:49.924 --> 43:52.558
Where they came from.

43:57.824 --> 44:00.657
<i>Rabbit fucked you.</i>

44:00.690 --> 44:02.558
<i>He fucked you hard.</i>

44:04.157 --> 44:06.057
<i>You served 15 years</i>

44:06.091 --> 44:08.790

<i>a handful of glass.</i>

44:16.990 --> 44:20.690
