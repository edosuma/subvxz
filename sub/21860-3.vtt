00:01.001 --> 00:03.671
Are you a fan
of poetry?

00:03.704 --> 00:07.808
What do you say to an evening
of "raging against
the dying of the light"?

00:13.013 --> 00:15.649
ANNOUNCER:
FX presents Better Things.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.557
(dog barking in distance)

00:31.632 --> 00:35.002
Uh, this one is
a haiku and a half.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.005
"As I counted the bracelets

00:38.038 --> 00:40.641
"on my dying mother's wrist,

00:40.674 --> 00:43.811
"it was as if
I was counting...

00:47.681 --> 00:49.683
...her pain."

00:52.086 --> 00:55.756
(scattered applause)

00:55.789 --> 00:57.525
Thank you.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.160
Thank you.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.061
WOMAN:
Congratulations, Joy.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.630
Oh...
(women whooping)

01:02.663 --> 01:04.665
Thank you,
thank you.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.667
Oh, that was really intense.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.237
(sighs)

01:09.270 --> 01:11.572
How do you know Joy?

01:11.605 --> 01:13.841
Oh, uh, college.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.576
Cool.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.111
I don't really know her.

01:17.145 --> 01:20.681
I-I just got an e-mail
saying she needed some support.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.082
Cool.

01:22.116 --> 01:25.085
ROBIN:
You have any kids?

01:25.119 --> 01:27.255
SAM:
Oh, I have three daughters.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.190
ROBIN:
You're married?

01:29.223 --> 01:31.259
SAM:
Divorced.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.861
Me, too.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.896
You have kids?

01:35.929 --> 01:39.167
I have a daughter, yeah.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.336
And how often
do you see her?

01:42.370 --> 01:43.904
Every day.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.707
How does that work?

01:46.740 --> 01:49.143
Well, I-I'm raising her.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.744
Oh.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.446
Her mom died?

01:52.480 --> 01:53.614
(chuckles):
No. No.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.082
She's-she's very much alive.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.784
After our divorce,

01:56.817 --> 01:58.752
I moved to a house
about a half a mile away,

01:58.786 --> 02:00.288
as close as I could get
to our house,

02:00.321 --> 02:01.822
so that I could be
near our daughter,

02:01.855 --> 02:03.357
but then her mom
met somebody

02:03.391 --> 02:04.792
and they moved very far away,

02:04.825 --> 02:07.461
and she has
a whole other life now.

02:07.495 --> 02:10.431
And she decided...

02:10.464 --> 02:14.402
not to raise my daughter,
so I'm doing it on my own.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.238
And how's that going?

02:17.271 --> 02:18.439
Pretty bad.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.440
(chuckles)

02:19.473 --> 02:22.042
Like your life, I guess.
Subtract two.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.146
Nice.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.148
("Everything Is New"
by Briana Marela playing)

02:28.182 --> 02:29.983
(singers vocalizing
ethereal music)

02:30.017 --> 02:32.286
*

02:49.803 --> 02:52.673
*

02:54.842 --> 02:55.809
(door opens)

02:55.843 --> 02:57.177
Mom, did you or did you not say

02:57.211 --> 02:59.480
that I could have the
minivan when I turn 16?

02:59.513 --> 03:00.781
Mom? Hi, Mommy.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.115
Can we spend time
together today?

03:02.149 --> 03:04.552
Mom, no fair.
What are you gonna do?

03:04.585 --> 03:06.086
My God, Frankie,
stop pretending like

03:06.119 --> 03:07.688
everything is a conspiracy
against you.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.524
FRANKIE: I don't want
the minivan anyway.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.761
I want a blue Mercedes,
where all the windows go down.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.963
Like, open windows.
I think it's so cute.

03:15.996 --> 03:19.066
MAX: Oh, and you think she's
just gonna buy one for you?

03:19.099 --> 03:20.834
FRANKIE: No, but, I mean,
like, if she wants one,

03:20.868 --> 03:23.837
then I could
also drive it.
MAX: Don't you like him?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.806
* What matters...
FRANKIE:
Ew, no. He's my teacher.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.208
MAX: He's a student teacher.
He's hot.

03:28.242 --> 03:32.079
* When everything
(girls continue chattering)

03:32.112 --> 03:35.283
* Is new

03:35.316 --> 03:36.717
MAX:
He has an eclectic style...

03:36.750 --> 03:38.852
(singers vocalizing)

03:38.886 --> 03:41.822
MAX:
He's quirky. I like it.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.156
FRANKIE:
That's so weird, Max.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.658
MAX: Well, who do you
have a crush on?

03:44.692 --> 03:46.126
You have a crush
on the weirdest people.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.095
FRANKIE: Excuse you?
MAX: Excuse me.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.830
FRANKIE: Like, you have a crush
on my teacher.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.399
-That's nasty.
-Your student teacher.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.900
* Be true...

03:52.933 --> 03:54.167
FRANKIE:
You think with your vagina.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.337
MAX:
That's right, I do.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.238
FRANKIE:
Yeah, and it's unfortunate,
because your vagina is stupid.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.907
It may be the only
part of your body

03:59.940 --> 04:01.174
that's dumber
than your brain.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.176
MAX: Okay, like
your vagina is a genius.

04:03.210 --> 04:04.745
FRANKIE: My vagina
is going to invent a car

04:04.778 --> 04:06.380
that runs on water.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.815
MAX: Congratulations.
FRANKIE: Thank you.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.017
Max, you have a shot.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.419
When you turn 18,
it won't make a difference.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.853
I'll get ordained
and marry you.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.388
MAX:
You would do that?

04:14.422 --> 04:15.589
FRANKIE: Yes, but I'll get
ordained as a Satanist,

04:15.623 --> 04:17.458
and you have to give
me your firstborn

04:17.491 --> 04:19.259
so I can drink its blood.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.361
MAX:
Yeah, okay, I'd do that.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.129
For Mr. Thompson, yeah.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.364
FRANKIE:
So it's settled.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.798
MAX:
Yes, it is.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.467
Does it have to be
my firstborn?

04:26.500 --> 04:28.101
FRANKIE: Yes.
MAX: Can I give you my husband?

04:28.135 --> 04:29.403
FRANKIE:
No.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.771
MAX:
All right, whatever.

04:30.804 --> 04:31.939
Classy.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.574
Why would you
post that, though?

04:33.607 --> 04:36.377
(Frankie and Max laughing)

04:36.410 --> 04:39.112
Okay, so when you hit
the vape too hard.

04:39.146 --> 04:42.215
* Is now, is now.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.217
(singers vocalizing)

04:44.251 --> 04:49.623
* Mother, you had me

04:49.657 --> 04:54.328
* But I never had you

04:54.362 --> 04:56.196
*

04:58.466 --> 05:02.336
* I wanted you

05:04.037 --> 05:08.976
* You didn't want me.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.178
*

05:11.211 --> 05:13.681
MAN:
Stop! Let's go this way.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.315
MAN 2:
That's what you said before!

05:15.349 --> 05:16.484
I'm not going!

05:16.517 --> 05:18.285
(high-pitched):
Don't be stupid.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.387
At least not now!

05:19.420 --> 05:21.455
You'd better be right!

05:21.489 --> 05:22.623
(sobbing):
Oh, come on.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.957
This way!

05:23.991 --> 05:26.259
(yells)
For crying in Pete's face,

05:26.293 --> 05:27.628
just come on!

05:27.661 --> 05:31.765
(groans loudly)

05:31.799 --> 05:34.001
(both screaming)

05:34.034 --> 05:38.238
(groans):
Get out of my cave!

05:38.271 --> 05:39.640
I told you!

05:39.673 --> 05:42.643
(groans loudly)

05:43.644 --> 05:44.812
Hmm?

05:44.845 --> 05:46.279
Lightning in a bottle.
Hitler.

05:46.313 --> 05:48.248
(laughs)
If it ain't broke, don't--

05:48.281 --> 05:49.883
If it ain't broke
don't fix it, right?
He's only got one ball!

05:50.951 --> 05:52.786
Are we good?
(whoops)

05:52.820 --> 05:53.987
(page turns)

05:54.021 --> 05:56.089
This is torture.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.626
Max, you have to drive.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.661
You need a license,
you have to wait in line.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.295
Yeah, I have to drive?

06:02.329 --> 06:05.499
My friends and I
couldn't wait to do this

06:05.533 --> 06:07.367
the second we turned 15.
Blah, blah.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.702
And the phones,
they were really big

06:08.736 --> 06:10.504
and they stayed
in your house.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.440
Oh, my God.

06:12.473 --> 06:16.209
We both suck.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.645
Can't we just go
to Dollar Bag

06:17.678 --> 06:18.912
and get Jolly Ranchers?

06:18.946 --> 06:20.213
Forward, Max.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.382
Your life needs to move forward.

06:22.416 --> 06:25.486
(phone vibrates)

06:25.519 --> 06:27.455
Hi. Hi.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.689
ROBIN:
Hi.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.057
Is it okay that I'm calling?

06:30.090 --> 06:33.260
Well, I did give you my number.
(laughs)

06:33.293 --> 06:34.495
How are you?

06:34.528 --> 06:35.663
I'm good.

06:35.696 --> 06:36.997
Yeah, I'm good.

06:37.030 --> 06:41.201
So, this is, uh...

06:41.234 --> 06:43.671
I'm gonna take a big swing
right now.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.405
Uh, go for it.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.074
Yeah?

06:47.107 --> 06:48.676
Yeah. Hi. What?

06:48.709 --> 06:50.277
I was planning on going

06:50.310 --> 06:52.112
up to El Cevitas this weekend.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.914
Mia has an overnight
with her school

06:53.947 --> 06:56.083
so I'm going away.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.417
So...

06:57.451 --> 06:59.319
I'm going to invite you
to come with me,

06:59.352 --> 07:00.988
to spend the weekend with me
in El Cevitas,

07:01.021 --> 07:03.691
and we can taste some wine

07:03.724 --> 07:05.025
or look at some art,

07:05.058 --> 07:08.228
uh, have some great food,

07:08.261 --> 07:10.864
and... yeah.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.534
Yeah, big, big weekend.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.169
Asking you to spend
the weekend, so...

07:16.203 --> 07:17.505
big swing.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.039
Yeah.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.809
That is a big swing there,
chief.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.111
You know what, I like you.

07:24.144 --> 07:28.048
I know it's-it's early
for me to be asking you

07:28.081 --> 07:32.019
to go away with me,
but I'm doing it

07:32.052 --> 07:34.788
because I like you that much.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.525
Uh, I just feel like we got off

07:37.558 --> 07:41.261
on such an unconventional foot
here and...

07:41.294 --> 07:44.532
I already had this trip planned

07:44.565 --> 07:48.335
and I don't want to wait until
next weekend to see you again,

07:48.368 --> 07:51.539
uh, because I... (sighs)

07:51.572 --> 07:53.273
I'm gonna stop there.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.744
Just, if you want to come,
please do.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.078
You're invited.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.279
And also...

07:59.312 --> 08:01.081
(line beeps)
Wait, what?

08:01.114 --> 08:02.583
Did you hear what I said?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.017
(line beeps)
Hold on.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.135
Um, I need to think about it.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.403
Is that okay?

08:23.436 --> 08:25.238
Yeah. More than okay.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.674
Really?
Yes.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.376
I'd be weirded out
if you said yes right away.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.478
(laughs) What?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.981
No, I mean, you know,
please go ahead.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.316
Talk to your girlfriends
about it.
Ew.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.185
Or don't.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.420
However you want to...
Okay. I'll...

08:40.453 --> 08:42.623
I'll call you later, okay?

08:42.656 --> 08:44.558
Yes. Yes, okay.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.695
Okay.

08:47.728 --> 08:48.929
Hey.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.798
Yeah?

08:50.831 --> 08:52.332
That was nice.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.534
Thank you for asking.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.469
I like it...

08:56.503 --> 08:58.639
how you asked.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.707
Okay.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.009
Bye.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.213
Ooh.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.382
Good move, buddy.

09:09.416 --> 09:13.220
Good move. Good move.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.691
Ooh.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.735
Oh, my God, we're not
going back in there.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.436
(groans)

09:32.105 --> 09:33.674
JOY:
We're estranged now.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.876
One year, she made me
flaming cherries jubilee.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.510
It was really good.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.512
I can't even remember
what we fought about.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.248
I don't know.

09:41.281 --> 09:45.452
I just feel like I still have
a lot of stuff left to do.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.220
I don't know. I can't
believe it's my birthday.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.657
It was really sweet
of you guys to take me out.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.825
I can't believe
I'm old enough to drink.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.394
(laughs)

09:54.427 --> 09:55.863
What's going on with you?

09:55.896 --> 09:58.766
Huh? Nothing.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.201
Nothing.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.370
Hi. Happy birthday.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.205
Yay, birthday!
Thank you.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.240
JOY: This is such
a great birthday. Yay!
TRESSA: We love you.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.275
Thank you.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.576
L'chaim.
Thank you.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.911
TRESSA:
Mazel.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.380
Oh.
Mmm.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.215
I'm tipsy.
(laughs)

10:15.248 --> 10:16.950
(laughing):
Aw.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.251
Bye, honey, love you.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.653
Bye. I love you, too.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.527
Hi. Hi.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.864
Uh, I would, uh...

10:30.898 --> 10:33.133
I would like to join you
this weekend.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.468
Um, very much so.

10:35.502 --> 10:39.406
So, uh, just wanted
to say that, okay?

10:39.439 --> 10:42.575
I'm, uh, hanging up now.

10:42.609 --> 10:43.844
Bye.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.580
Where are you going?

10:47.614 --> 10:49.249
I'm packing.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.483
Mom, where are you going?

10:50.517 --> 10:52.119
Bitch, I'm going to the moon.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.954
My God, Mom,
that's so offensive.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.089
I'm so fat.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.124
Can't believe
I have a boyfriend.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.258
Who's staying with us?

10:58.291 --> 10:59.292
Stay with us what?

10:59.326 --> 11:01.294
Susie.
Mom, no way.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.629
Wait, where are you going?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.097
She's going
to the moon, bitch.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.398
Shut up, Frankie.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.734
Mom, Mom, we don't need Susie.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.268
I can watch everyone.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.170
No. Mom, don't leave us
with Susie. She sucks.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.172
And don't leave us with Max.
She's so much worse.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.174
SAM:
Fine. Then no one's coming.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.809
I don't care.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.610
Can I have a couple friends
over? Not a party.

11:17.644 --> 11:18.846
I don't care.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.180
Run away while I'm gone.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.282
I don't care about any of it.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.417
There's nothing in this house
that's worth anything to me,

11:24.451 --> 11:25.953
except the art.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.955
Don't mess with my paintings.
Good-bye.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.356
MAX: Mom, I don't get
what your problem is.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.623
You're my problem.

11:30.657 --> 11:32.559
You're insane.

11:32.592 --> 11:34.161
Why'd you say "I'm going
to the moon, bitch"?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.863
FRANKIE: I don't know.
She said it to me.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.630
MAX: Mom, you're not
serious, are you?

11:37.664 --> 11:39.199
FRANKIE: Mom, you still have
to take me to Chloe's house

11:39.232 --> 11:41.168
on Saturday.
What are you doing at Chloe's?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.536
I just want to know.
Well, what are you gonna
do with your friends?

11:43.570 --> 11:45.172
Mom, this is
child abandonment.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.706
We're like orphans now.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.375
I don't care.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.043
You guys can move out

11:50.077 --> 11:51.812
and get an apartment together
when I'm gone.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.380
Seriously.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.415
I'll cosign the lease right now
to make that happen.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.450
MAX: Oh, my God,
Mom, it is so mean

11:57.484 --> 11:58.786
that you're saying
that to me, Mom.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.587
Wait, Mom.
Mom, did you mean it?

12:00.620 --> 12:01.922
I want to get an apartment.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.391
Mom!

12:04.424 --> 12:06.794
Mom!

12:11.765 --> 12:13.100
(tires screech)

12:16.069 --> 12:18.171
Yoo-hoo!

12:18.205 --> 12:20.607
(stammers)

12:31.418 --> 12:35.022
So, what do you do when you
have a minute to yourself?

12:35.055 --> 12:36.924
Oh.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.691
I drink alcohol
and I sleep.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.393
(laughs)

12:40.427 --> 12:43.230
If I have two minutes, I watch
murder shows on cable.

12:43.263 --> 12:47.167
Oh. Murder like Law & Order
or murder like real murder?

12:47.200 --> 12:49.636
Oh, no, only ever real murder.

12:49.669 --> 12:52.940
I could jack off to real people
being murdered for hours.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.075
Why do you like
murder so much?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.709
I don't know.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.479
I, uh, fantasize
about being murdered.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.747
You do?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.782
Yeah.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.853
I mean, it feels like
I'm being murdered every day

13:05.886 --> 13:08.655
in a vague way that no one
could prosecute anyone for,

13:08.688 --> 13:10.858
so when I see these stories

13:10.891 --> 13:13.226
about the lady
who gets her head chopped off,

13:13.260 --> 13:15.362
and they find hairs
on the guy's knife

13:15.395 --> 13:16.796
and he gets
put away for life,

13:16.830 --> 13:19.299
that's, like,
very satisfying, you know?

13:19.332 --> 13:21.801
Nope.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.170
No?
You don't get it.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.637
(laughing):
No, I get it. I do.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.940
(laughing):
You... come on.
I do. Sorry.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.641
(both laughing)

13:28.675 --> 13:30.477
Oh.

13:30.510 --> 13:34.781
Yeah, the year that, uh, Mia's
mom took off was really bad.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.750
Yeah.
Yeah, really, really bad.

13:37.784 --> 13:41.121
I had a cool job,
but the money wasn't huge,

13:41.154 --> 13:43.356
so I had to quit it
so I could concentrate more

13:43.390 --> 13:46.159
on earning and-and raising her.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.261
Mm.
But, I mean, it's nothing

13:48.295 --> 13:50.597
compared to what
Mia suffered, though.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.500
Well, losing her mom...

13:53.533 --> 13:57.470
It would've been a whole lot
easier if we had lost her.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.773
I swear, if...
if her mom was dead,

14:00.807 --> 14:02.842
i-it would be so much easier

14:02.876 --> 14:05.979
than knowing that her mother
is alive, out there,

14:06.013 --> 14:08.181
just completely
not giving a shit.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.118
You know, there's a limit to how
much I can explain that to her.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.687
I'm right there with you, buddy.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.190
Well, a-anyway, that's,
that's what I think is good

14:17.224 --> 14:19.859
about having kids because,

14:19.893 --> 14:22.562
you know, no matter what
is happening with you,

14:22.595 --> 14:24.297
you can only care
about it so much

14:24.331 --> 14:26.666
when you see how
they deal with it.
Yeah.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.335
Mia is amazing.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.337
She really showed me
how to cope.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.806
(sighs heavily)

14:33.840 --> 14:35.875
Yeah.

14:38.811 --> 14:41.014
* Ooh

14:41.048 --> 14:45.018
* Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

14:45.052 --> 14:46.419
* Ooh, ooh...

14:46.453 --> 14:47.955
That was a really
lovely thing you did,

14:47.988 --> 14:49.189
when you touched
the flower there.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.190
Why'd you do that?

14:50.223 --> 14:51.624
Why do you think?

14:53.693 --> 14:54.928
'Cause there's a bee, maybe?

14:54.962 --> 14:57.164
Yes, Robin, a bee.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.199
(both laugh)

15:02.102 --> 15:06.839
* In time she'll see
that her and me *

15:06.873 --> 15:10.810
* Were meant to be together

15:13.780 --> 15:17.217
* And time will pass,
it may go fast *

15:17.250 --> 15:20.353
* But we'll still be

15:20.387 --> 15:22.922
* Together

15:22.956 --> 15:27.260
* It's easy love,
fits like a glove *

15:27.294 --> 15:30.030
* From up above

15:30.063 --> 15:32.532
* Together

15:32.565 --> 15:37.971
* Together...

15:39.572 --> 15:41.841
Mmm, fruity with
a wet stone finish.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.243
Hmm.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.378
I'm not getting
wet stone. Are you?

15:45.412 --> 15:47.080
A little.
Hmm.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.915
(clicks tongue)
It's not fair.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.084
There's no wet
stone in mine.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.553
(chuckles)
Have another sip--
it may show up.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.188
I think it will.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.656
Mmm.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.259
SAM (deep voice):
Hello.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.728
(both laugh)

16:04.497 --> 16:06.766
(gasps softly)

16:06.799 --> 16:08.835
(chuckles)

16:08.868 --> 16:10.737
(exhales):
Oh...

16:11.938 --> 16:14.507
Hey, so, where
are we staying tonight?

16:15.508 --> 16:17.177
Oh.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.246
It's a surprise.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.813
Really?

16:20.847 --> 16:22.449
Yeah.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.651
Oh. Well, the thing
(chuckles)

16:24.684 --> 16:27.787
about that is I hate surprises
very, very much.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.422
Well, if you're gonna be

16:29.456 --> 16:32.992
with me, you'll get
lots of surprises.

16:33.026 --> 16:36.196
O... kay.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.365
So, where are we staying?

16:40.333 --> 16:41.534
(chuckles)

16:41.568 --> 16:43.270
Are you worried
about being with me?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.937
Are you scared of
me or something?

16:44.971 --> 16:46.706
(laughs):
No.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.141
Not at all.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.909
Do you... do you...
do you want to know

16:49.942 --> 16:51.844
why I'm asking
where we're staying?

16:51.878 --> 16:53.313
Sure.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.914
Well, because...

16:54.947 --> 16:58.485
I want to call ahead
and book myself a room.

16:58.518 --> 17:02.289
So, did you book us
two rooms or one?

17:02.322 --> 17:03.956
One room.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.025
I... I mean, I...

17:06.059 --> 17:08.128
I wasn't presuming
anything...

17:08.161 --> 17:09.629
Oh, no, no, no.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.298
I know that, Robin.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.100
It's not that. You're fine.

17:13.133 --> 17:16.069
I just... I wanted
to give us a break

17:16.103 --> 17:17.670
and take a little
pressure off,

17:17.704 --> 17:20.207
because, you know,

17:20.240 --> 17:22.209
if-if I get a room
and you get a room,

17:22.242 --> 17:24.477
then we could both do
whatever we want.

17:24.511 --> 17:28.348
If we only have one room,
then we can only do one thing.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.151
Do you know what
I'm saying, buddy?

17:31.184 --> 17:32.619
(chuckles nervously)

17:34.254 --> 17:37.056
Oh, my God. I'm not trying
to make things awkward,

17:37.090 --> 17:38.425
I'm really not, I just...

17:38.458 --> 17:39.992
was hoping that...

17:40.026 --> 17:42.162
by now that
you would tell me

17:42.195 --> 17:47.033
so I could call ahead... and
make accommodations for myself,

17:47.066 --> 17:49.602
but it turns out
that I had to ask, so...
Ah.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.472
um...
Okay, okay. Wow.
(chuckles)

17:52.505 --> 17:56.509
Now, I planned this trip
very carefully, and...

17:56.543 --> 17:58.111
I was excited to...

17:58.145 --> 18:00.880
surprise you with
every stage of it.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.116
So...

18:03.150 --> 18:05.985
this is a bit of an ice pack
to my balls...

18:06.018 --> 18:07.554
to tell you the truth.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.624
Oh.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.161
Well, I didn't mean
to ice-pack your balls.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.696
I was just trying...
No, it's okay.
It's okay.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.401
Okay.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.536
We're staying
at the Redwood Inn.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.604
Okay. Thanks.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.706
And I will call...

18:26.739 --> 18:29.376
I will book you a separate room.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.711
Thanks.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.446
I'm going to the bathroom.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.881
Oh. Yeah.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.783
It's okay.

18:42.655 --> 18:43.923
Mm.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.894
(exhales)

18:50.597 --> 18:52.432
That's fun stuff.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.767
Mm-hmm.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.269
Mmm.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.942
That's a bit of an ice pack
to my balls.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.511
Mm.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.118
I'm pretty hungry.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.955
I'm excited about
eating food and stuff.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.458
(groans):
Oh. It's, like...

19:18.491 --> 19:21.294
sometimes my levels of...

19:21.328 --> 19:23.930
(clicks tongue)
not having food in my body

19:23.963 --> 19:26.999
just get to a low point.

19:38.044 --> 19:41.548
(singing unintelligibly
with thick country accent)

19:44.351 --> 19:46.786
(rhythmic grunting)

19:50.323 --> 19:52.892
(singing along): * I'm just
cruising with nowhere to go *

19:52.925 --> 19:55.662
* I'm hitting corners, I'm just
cruising with nowhere to go *

19:55.695 --> 19:58.197
* I'm all in Compton and I'm
cruising with nowhere to go *

19:58.231 --> 20:00.600
* I hit the hood, I'm just
cruising with nowhere to go *

20:00.633 --> 20:02.435
* I'm just dippin'

20:02.469 --> 20:04.203
* I'm just cruising down
this little mall *

20:04.237 --> 20:06.639
* Looking for a bad one,
tank full of gas... *

20:06.673 --> 20:09.309
WAITER: And we have a really
nice venison steak tonight.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.010
The chef, uh,
recommends it

20:11.043 --> 20:12.111
medium rare.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.480
It comes
with the collard greens

20:13.513 --> 20:15.382
and a truffled mashed
sweet potato.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.550
I'll give you guys a minute
while I bring your drinks, okay?

20:17.584 --> 20:18.818
Okay. Thank you.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.920
(clears throat
loudly)

20:20.953 --> 20:23.155
Venison. Oh!

20:23.189 --> 20:25.392
I love venison.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.394
I love to eat deer

20:27.427 --> 20:29.729
and sheep
and all the cute animals.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.698
So good.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.199
This place is so cute.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.867
I love the decor.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.537
It's, like,
Navajo theme,

20:37.570 --> 20:40.540
like, safari,
gold rush...

20:40.573 --> 20:43.410
Some beer steins
over there.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.712
Mandolins...
everywhere.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.547
I don't know
why those are here.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.181
It's kind of cool.

20:49.215 --> 20:51.183
It's, like, when a place
feels, like, old-fashioned

20:51.217 --> 20:52.985
and modern
at the same time.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.654
There's this place
in the valley...

20:54.687 --> 20:55.955
I'm really sorry.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.191
For what?

20:59.225 --> 21:00.560
For the hotel thing.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.162
Oh. No, no, no.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.731
Robin, it's okay.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.600
No, no, it's not okay.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.736
It's really shitty of me.

21:09.769 --> 21:13.506
I mean, I've been thinking
about this all this time,

21:13.540 --> 21:16.443
and it's killing me
that I did that.

21:16.476 --> 21:19.412
I mean, if I were you,
I would probably be...

21:19.446 --> 21:22.949
thinking of how I could
escape and go home.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.217
I don't know, Sam.

21:25.251 --> 21:27.554
I'm really sorry.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.089
(sighs)
I-I'm so dumb.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.291
You were really
looking out for us

21:32.325 --> 21:34.060
by wanting that other room.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.863
That was very, very smart.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.432
And all I could think of...

21:39.466 --> 21:41.568
was that you were...

21:41.601 --> 21:43.936
taking something away from me

21:43.970 --> 21:47.640
and ruining my surprise,
like I'm a little baby boy.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.576
(chuckles softly)

21:49.609 --> 21:51.611
And now I'm having
to dump all this on you,

21:51.644 --> 21:53.145
like we have to have

21:53.179 --> 21:54.914
this shitty thing now,
and we're not even

21:54.947 --> 21:56.315
in a thing yet.

21:56.349 --> 21:59.318
And I'm just...
I'm ruining all the fun.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.488
No. Robin, I-I just...

22:01.521 --> 22:02.655
No, no, no,

22:02.689 --> 22:04.957
Sam, I-I messed up.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.893
And... look,

22:06.926 --> 22:10.397
I really want to get this right.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.165
I don't know if it's
gonna be anything between us.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.001
I-I have no idea.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.335
(takes deep breath)

22:16.369 --> 22:18.137
But I don't want it to stop

22:18.170 --> 22:21.173
because of me being
my stupid old self.

22:21.207 --> 22:22.442
You know?

22:22.475 --> 22:25.244
I've had my
bad episodes.

22:25.277 --> 22:28.981
I have old scars,
a lot of self-inflicted wounds.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.451
You know when you
see yourself...

22:31.484 --> 22:34.587
making the same dumb mistakes

22:34.621 --> 22:36.689
over and over again?

22:36.723 --> 22:37.990
Sure.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.660
Sure, I get it.
This is...

22:40.693 --> 22:42.194
probably not...

22:42.228 --> 22:45.698
the last time
I'll do something stupid again.

22:45.732 --> 22:49.536
I mean, do you think
you could hang in there
with me a little?

22:49.569 --> 22:53.172
Maybe give me some time
to get better at it?

22:53.205 --> 22:55.708
Even if... if I was...

22:55.742 --> 22:57.276
(sighs):
Aw, shit.

22:57.309 --> 22:58.811
I'm blowing this.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.413
Am I blowing it?

23:01.881 --> 23:04.316
Are you kidding me?

23:06.419 --> 23:08.788
Robin...

23:08.821 --> 23:11.090
Yeah?

23:13.192 --> 23:17.296
I've been holding in ten gallons
of piss since the vineyard.

23:17.329 --> 23:18.898
(whispers):
Oh.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.567
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,

23:20.600 --> 23:22.735
and when I come back...

23:22.769 --> 23:24.671
we're gonna start over.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.105
Okay?

23:27.106 --> 23:28.307
Yeah.
All right.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.408
Okay.

23:29.442 --> 23:30.710
Okay.
